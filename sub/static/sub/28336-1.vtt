01:03.044 --> 01:06.375
Please identify the accused.

01:06.377 --> 01:08.008
Dr. William Chester Minor...

01:08.010 --> 01:13.144
Captain Surgeon in the US Army,
retired.

01:13.810 --> 01:16.842
Dr. Minor has come to our shores
seeking sanctuary.

01:16.844 --> 01:20.409
In his home country of the
United States, he was pursued...

01:20.411 --> 01:24.010
relentlessly by a man pledged
to torture and kill him.

01:31.911 --> 01:33.141
On that fateful night...

01:33.143 --> 01:36.242
of the 17th of February, the
defendant woke with a start...

01:36.244 --> 01:41.076
he knew right away that he had
been hunted down and found...

01:41.078 --> 01:44.976
that his pursuer, one Declan
Reilly was indeed, in his rooms.

01:46.310 --> 01:51.211
Dr. Minor reached for his
service revolver and gave chase.

02:05.910 --> 02:08.243
Fenian!

02:10.943 --> 02:12.941
In the
streets, he found a man running.

02:12.943 --> 02:15.310
Help! Help!

02:21.976 --> 02:23.743
Help!

02:47.910 --> 02:52.274
Eliza, open the door! Eliza!

02:52.276 --> 02:54.107
Eliza!

02:54.109 --> 02:56.074
In the confusion of night...

02:56.076 --> 02:58.075
he failed to discern the
difference...

02:58.077 --> 03:02.041
between his assailant and the
innocent George Merrett.

03:02.043 --> 03:03.077
Eliza.

03:11.243 --> 03:12.908
Stop there!

03:12.910 --> 03:14.175
This is not the Fenian!

03:14.177 --> 03:15.874
No!

03:15.876 --> 03:17.741
This is not the Fenian?

03:17.743 --> 03:18.874
No!

03:18.876 --> 03:23.143
I'm sorry! Sorry!

03:24.943 --> 03:26.708
No!

03:37.277 --> 03:41.707
My Lord, Dr. Minor shot the
wrong man.

03:47.009 --> 03:51.673
So... he didn't mean it.

03:51.675 --> 03:54.074
My Lord, perhaps the court
should simply release...

03:54.076 --> 03:56.074
the good doctor with an
apology...

03:56.076 --> 03:58.675
for the misunderstanding that
has occurred.

04:04.842 --> 04:07.009
Your Honor!?

04:11.076 --> 04:14.940
Declan... Declan Reilly
is his name!

04:14.942 --> 04:18.807
He has a brand on the left side
of his face, he comes at night!

04:18.809 --> 04:23.673
He comes with others, they haunt
me, they come into my rooms!

04:23.675 --> 04:28.274
I do not believe you, sir.
This court does not believe you.

04:30.142 --> 04:34.240
Quiet, please! Quiet in court!

04:34.242 --> 04:38.040
Quiet, please! Quiet!

04:38.042 --> 04:41.974
Quiet, quiet!

04:43.975 --> 04:47.639
We, the members of her Majesty's
jury...

04:47.641 --> 04:51.106
find Dr. William Chester Minor
not guilty...

04:51.108 --> 04:54.073
of the willful murder
of George Merrett...

04:55.808 --> 04:57.806
Quiet! Quiet!

04:57.808 --> 05:00.240
...on the grounds of insanity.

05:00.242 --> 05:02.140
I am not insane, sir.

05:02.142 --> 05:03.175
Quiet, please!

05:05.941 --> 05:10.140
William Chester Minor, it is
hereby this court's ruling...

05:10.142 --> 05:12.705
that you shall be detained
in safe custody...

05:12.707 --> 05:15.173
at Broadmoor Asylum for the
Criminally Insane...

05:15.175 --> 05:19.175
until Her Majesty's pleasure
be known.

05:21.874 --> 05:23.707
Quiet, please!

05:34.908 --> 05:36.975
Move, move!

05:44.409 --> 05:46.073
Bloody bollocks hell!

05:47.375 --> 05:49.739
Hey! Any more of that
and you're off!

05:49.741 --> 05:51.574
Harold!

05:56.375 --> 05:57.972
I must get back in, father.

05:57.974 --> 05:59.972
In a tick, boy. Take a few
breaths.

05:59.974 --> 06:01.772
Mind the long run down the
flank.

06:01.774 --> 06:03.739
If you see the brute coming,
stay downpitch...

06:03.741 --> 06:05.839
and don't let him pull you in,
all right?

06:05.841 --> 06:07.206
And try for the clean catch.

06:07.208 --> 06:08.906
Yes, sir. The game, sir.

06:08.908 --> 06:12.339
Harold, about your use
of words...

06:12.341 --> 06:13.772
Yes, sir.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.041
- Good. In you go, boy, go on.
- Yes, sir!

06:25.207 --> 06:27.005
I had a word with him.

06:27.007 --> 06:28.139
Yes, I saw.

06:28.141 --> 06:31.906
In the paper, a dreadful story,
a shooting in Lambeth...

06:31.908 --> 06:34.039
by an American, an army
officer...

06:34.041 --> 06:37.238
and that poor woman left behind
with six children.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.705
That I saw.

06:39.707 --> 06:41.838
I don't know what I would do,
James...

06:41.840 --> 06:43.308
if you were taken like that.

06:45.707 --> 06:50.074
Yes! That's it, that's it!

06:52.741 --> 06:55.373
Yes! Yes!

06:55.375 --> 06:58.972
Yes, yes! How's that, you
ensanguined mule?

07:00.774 --> 07:03.038
- That's it, you're off!
- What's wrong with ensanguined?

07:03.040 --> 07:05.973
- Get off!
- Harold! Harold!

07:21.807 --> 07:25.272
I wish to state that I possess
a general lexical...

07:25.274 --> 07:27.806
and structural knowledge of the
languages...

07:27.808 --> 07:31.905
and literature of the Aryan
and Syro-Arabic classes.

07:31.907 --> 07:34.338
I have recently submitted my
paper on the declension...

07:34.340 --> 07:37.272
of German verbs to the
Philological Society.

07:37.274 --> 07:39.005
Mr. Murray, I understand that...

07:39.007 --> 07:41.205
you do not possess
a university degree.

07:41.207 --> 07:44.239
No, sir, no degree.

07:44.241 --> 07:46.673
I am an autodidact, self-taught.

07:47.075 --> 07:51.338
I am aware of the word.
Schooling?

07:51.340 --> 07:54.038
Left at 14 to earn a living.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.838
Honestly, Freddie, it's a bit
much.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.973
A bit much, yes.

08:01.374 --> 08:04.238
Of course, we, the august
delegates...

08:04.240 --> 08:05.805
of the Oxford University
Press...

08:05.807 --> 08:08.205
have been attempting to make
this dictionary...

08:08.207 --> 08:09.472
for the last 20 years.

08:09.474 --> 08:12.905
And despite the greatest efforts
of a whole army of academics...

08:12.907 --> 08:15.238
myself included, we are
precisely nowhere.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.205
Forgive me that is incorrect.

08:17.207 --> 08:19.704
We are, in fact, going
backwards.

08:19.706 --> 08:22.205
The language is developing
faster than our progress.

08:22.207 --> 08:25.838
This great tongue of ours, which
reaches out across the world...

08:25.840 --> 08:28.038
has drawn its guns, sharpened
its bayonets...

08:28.040 --> 08:30.670
and declared that it will not
be tamed.

08:30.672 --> 08:34.038
And we, with our debates ad
nauseam about the scope...

08:34.039 --> 08:36.837
the mode, the purpose of these
words have all...

08:36.840 --> 08:39.970
but thrown ourselves down
in supplication before it...

08:39.972 --> 08:43.240
bathed in abject defeat.

08:44.740 --> 08:46.807
At this moment, the endeavor
is dead.

08:49.239 --> 08:52.074
Is that too much, Max?

08:54.207 --> 08:56.172
Gentlemen, I'm afraid nothing...

08:56.174 --> 08:58.204
short of a panacea is called
for.

08:58.206 --> 09:01.405
I submit that the extraordinary,
the unconventional...

09:01.407 --> 09:05.639
Mr. Murray is the solution
and our salvation.

09:07.672 --> 09:11.771
Your account, though a bit
dramatic, is true, Freddie.

09:11.773 --> 09:15.338
But we need something more than
impassioned advocacy.

09:15.340 --> 09:19.637
Qualifications come to mind.
Perhaps a Bachelor's Degree.

09:19.639 --> 09:21.005
Qualifications, yes.

09:21.007 --> 09:25.371
Well, I am fluent in Latin and
Greek, of course.

09:25.373 --> 09:27.870
Beyond those, I have an intimate
knowledge...

09:27.872 --> 09:30.937
of the Romance tongues, Italian,
French, Spanish...

09:30.939 --> 09:34.237
Catalan and to a lesser degree
Portugese, Vaudois...

09:34.239 --> 09:36.905
Provencal and other dialects.

09:36.907 --> 09:40.870
In the Teutonic branch, I am
familiar with German, Dutch...

09:40.872 --> 09:41.970
Danish and Flemish.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.870
I have specialized in
Anglo-Saxon and Moeso-Gothic...

09:44.872 --> 09:47.637
and have prepared works
for publication...

09:47.639 --> 09:48.603
in both of these languages.

09:48.605 --> 09:51.770
I also have a useful knowledge
of Russian.

09:51.772 --> 09:55.104
I have sufficient knowledge of
Hebrew and Syriac to read...

09:55.106 --> 09:57.637
at sight the Old Testament and
the Peshito...

09:57.639 --> 10:00.670
to a lesser degree, Aramaic,
Arabic, Coptic...

10:00.672 --> 10:04.237
and Phoenician to the point
where it was left by Genesius.

10:04.239 --> 10:06.703
Forgive me rattling on.

10:06.705 --> 10:09.173
I'm sure you have questions.

10:12.073 --> 10:17.137
Mr. Murray, a word comes
to mind... clever.

10:17.139 --> 10:22.904
Can you define it and tell us
its history?

10:22.906 --> 10:26.937
I'll make a fist of it, on the
hoof, as it were.

10:26.939 --> 10:30.904
Clever: adjective. Meaning -
adroit, nimble, dextrous.

10:30.906 --> 10:33.937
Probably from the Low German,
Klover.

10:33.939 --> 10:36.070
Or perhaps the Middle Dutch,
Klever...

10:36.072 --> 10:42.171
with a "k", meaning sprightly
or smart.

10:42.173 --> 10:48.138
Mr. Murray is also a master
of the Scottish clog dance.

10:49.805 --> 10:52.273
Forgive me for keeping
it from you...

10:52.871 --> 10:55.271
I scarcely believed in the
chance myself.

10:55.273 --> 10:59.605
It's all mine, Ada, the entire
language.

11:03.638 --> 11:05.769
I've never known how to resist
it, your exuberance...

11:05.771 --> 11:09.037
but it's so sudden.

11:09.039 --> 11:11.136
And to abandon all this, the
school, the constancy.

11:11.138 --> 11:15.237
Is it truly what you wish
for all of us?

11:15.239 --> 11:18.903
Ada, I'm an untutored linen
draper's boy from Teviotdale...

11:18.905 --> 11:22.070
now, suddenly, with a real crack
at it.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.903
My entire life has been in
preparation for this.

11:25.705 --> 11:27.702
The call has finally come.

11:27.704 --> 11:30.304
Whatever I've done,
I've done with you.

11:30.306 --> 11:33.104
I've never been able to
without you.

11:33.106 --> 11:35.370
Once again, lend yourself to me?

11:35.372 --> 11:39.138
If I am to fashion a book,
I'll need a spine.

11:41.038 --> 11:42.803
Father!

11:42.805 --> 11:44.336
Elsie, children.

11:44.338 --> 11:48.205
Are we going somewhere?

11:49.705 --> 11:51.903
To Oxford, your father
is the editor...

11:51.905 --> 11:54.336
of the New English Dictionary
on Historical Principles.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.336
What is that?

11:55.338 --> 11:58.036
It's a very big book with a lot
of words in it.

11:58.038 --> 11:59.636
All the words of the English
language.

11:59.638 --> 12:01.370
Like Doctor Johnson's
Dictionary?

12:01.372 --> 12:06.172
Yes, but his book comprised of
only a mere handful of words.

12:06.671 --> 12:12.869
I am charged with identifying
and defining every last word!

12:12.871 --> 12:14.170
Will "happy" be in there,
Father?

12:14.172 --> 12:15.936
Aye, "happy" will be there,
Elsie.

12:15.938 --> 12:20.836
My dictionary will need as many
volumes as these...

12:20.838 --> 12:23.002
to house the entire language.

12:23.004 --> 12:24.170
Will "sad"?

12:24.172 --> 12:25.735
"Sad" will be there, yes, aye.

12:25.737 --> 12:27.336
What about "big", will "big"
be in there?

12:27.338 --> 12:28.303
Yeah, aye, and "small" too.

12:28.305 --> 12:30.769
There isn't a word you can
think of that...

12:30.771 --> 12:32.235
will not be in this very
big book.

12:32.237 --> 12:33.903
- Father?
- Yes, Oswyn.

12:33.905 --> 12:36.103
Will "Oswyn" be in there?

12:36.105 --> 12:38.005
Uh... probably...

12:42.271 --> 12:46.237
Never play with books,
all right? That's wrong.

12:58.904 --> 13:04.835
<i>Wednesday, April
17, 1872. Inmate number 742.</i>

13:04.837 --> 13:06.836
742, admittance.

13:06.838 --> 13:08.903
<i>Minor, William Chester...</i>

13:08.905 --> 13:12.269
<i>American, 48 years old...</i>

13:12.271 --> 13:17.635
<i>surgeon, a captain in the
United States Army.</i>

13:17.637 --> 13:22.337
<i>No known religion, classified
a danger to others.</i>

13:24.337 --> 13:26.137
<i>Assigned to Block Two.</i>

13:37.870 --> 13:42.902
<i>The prisoner is in a rage,
spitting dozens of times...</i>

13:42.904 --> 13:47.335
<i>by his own account trying not
to swallow poison-coated...</i>

13:47.337 --> 13:53.238
<i>cold, iron bars that have been
pressed against his teeth.</i>

14:03.037 --> 14:04.670
In you go.

14:15.870 --> 14:18.201
<i>March 17th...</i>

14:18.203 --> 14:21.737
<i>three days now the prisoner
has gone without sleep.</i>

14:32.070 --> 14:35.834
<i>Constantly leaping from his bed
to search...</i>

14:35.836 --> 14:38.069
<i>underneath it in sheer terror.</i>

14:38.071 --> 14:43.770
<i>Repeatedly claiming to look for
those coming for him at night.</i>

14:48.669 --> 14:52.202
<i>Doctor Richard Brayn, alienist
superintendent...</i>

14:52.204 --> 14:56.603
Broadmoor Asylum.

15:03.004 --> 15:05.368
There it was, staring me
in the face...

15:05.370 --> 15:08.901
the Home Secretary wouldn't be
bamboozled into accepting.

15:08.903 --> 15:09.834
Can you believe it?

15:09.836 --> 15:12.402
Like Orthrus, a two-headed dog
of a line.

15:12.404 --> 15:16.235
Written... in the Athenaeum...
in a single sentence!

15:16.237 --> 15:19.835
Your book, Mr. Murray, will need
to establish strict rules...

15:19.837 --> 15:21.735
banning such offenses.

15:21.737 --> 15:23.734
Beyond which it should fix all
spellings...

15:23.736 --> 15:26.169
lay down proper
pronunciations...

15:26.171 --> 15:28.667
and firm up correctness
of speech.

15:28.669 --> 15:29.868
We've been here before, Max.

15:29.870 --> 15:32.668
What of all the bamboozles, the
wouldn'ts, the shouldn'ts...

15:32.670 --> 15:34.901
and the couldn'ts to come
in the future?

15:34.903 --> 15:37.234
The tongue is at its purest
peak.

15:37.236 --> 15:41.168
Sufficiently refined that it can
henceforward only deteriorate.

15:41.170 --> 15:43.967
It is up to us to fix it once
and for all.

15:43.969 --> 15:46.967
Alterations to it can then be
permitted or not.

15:46.969 --> 15:48.967
And who would you have do the
permitting?

15:48.969 --> 15:52.334
You, Max? Me? No.

15:52.336 --> 15:55.667
All words are valid in the
language.

15:55.669 --> 15:58.234
Ancient or new, obsolete or
robust...

15:58.236 --> 15:59.368
foreign-born or home-grown.

15:59.370 --> 16:03.168
The book must inventory every
word, every nuance...

16:03.170 --> 16:06.734
every twist of etymology and
every possible illustrated...

16:06.736 --> 16:08.866
citation from every English
author.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.867
All of it or nothing at all.

16:11.869 --> 16:13.667
That would mean reading
everything.

16:13.669 --> 16:15.967
Quoting everything that showed
anything to do...

16:15.969 --> 16:18.401
with the history of the words
that are to be cited.

16:18.403 --> 16:21.201
The task is gigantic,
monumental.

16:21.203 --> 16:22.602
And impossible.

16:24.170 --> 16:26.634
There is a way.

16:26.636 --> 16:28.801
A task that might take one man
a hundred lifetimes...

16:28.803 --> 16:31.301
could take a hundred men
just one.

16:31.303 --> 16:34.901
Volunteers. We have tried it
before, James, and failed.

16:34.903 --> 16:38.301
I'm afraid there aren't enough
academics in the land.

16:38.303 --> 16:40.068
How many did you enlist?

16:40.070 --> 16:41.401
Eighty, perhaps ninety.

16:41.403 --> 16:43.767
With a thousand, you could
accomplish it...

16:43.769 --> 16:45.234
in just a few years.

16:45.236 --> 16:48.766
Where do you propose finding
a thousand men?

16:48.768 --> 16:51.734
Everywhere English is celebrated
and spoken.

16:51.736 --> 16:55.634
In every book shop, school,
workplace or home.

16:55.636 --> 16:58.234
Do you mean ordinary people,
amateurs?

16:58.236 --> 17:00.934
English speaking ones, aye.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.201
We will ask them to read...

17:02.203 --> 17:06.267
in search of the words that we
want, and get them to write...

17:06.269 --> 17:11.334
the word on a slip of paper,
along with a quotation...

17:11.336 --> 17:15.201
that they have found
illustrating the very word.

17:15.203 --> 17:17.733
And then? Post the slip tass.

17:17.736 --> 17:20.933
An entire army covering the
breadth of the Empire...

17:20.935 --> 17:23.067
and beyond, drawing a sweep
net...

17:23.069 --> 17:25.167
over the whole of English
literature...

17:25.170 --> 17:27.733
listing the entirety of their
own language.

17:27.734 --> 17:29.300
A dictionary by democracy.

17:29.302 --> 17:32.766
Still edited by us, learned men.

17:32.768 --> 17:35.067
And with this system,
Mr. Murray...

17:35.069 --> 17:38.699
how long do you estimate
to finishing your task?

17:38.701 --> 17:40.866
Five years, seven at most.

17:40.868 --> 17:43.734
All words... and their complete
histories?

17:43.736 --> 17:46.033
Every last one.

17:46.035 --> 17:49.699
Dear England...

17:49.701 --> 17:52.666
We are about to embark on the
greatest adventure...

17:52.668 --> 17:54.200
our language has ever known.

17:54.202 --> 17:56.300
Let us begin at aardvark...

17:56.302 --> 17:59.200
and never stop 'til we reach
Zymurgy.

17:59.202 --> 18:00.400
Zymurgy?

18:00.402 --> 18:03.766
I would wager that that is the
last word in the language.

18:03.768 --> 18:05.333
Surely there is nothing
after Z-Y.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.434
Meaning?

18:06.436 --> 18:09.568
You'll be able to look it up
in a few short years.

18:13.002 --> 18:15.232
There's a cloying
eagerness to him.

18:15.234 --> 18:16.333
Yes.

18:16.335 --> 18:17.434
And that grating Scottish
lilt...

18:17.436 --> 18:20.267
why do you suppose he doesn't
try to conceal it...

18:20.269 --> 18:21.933
for the sake of our eardrums.

18:21.935 --> 18:27.699
His ideas are quite radical,
just what we need.

18:27.701 --> 18:28.733
You don't think he's a
follower...

18:28.735 --> 18:31.233
of that awful German-born
pamphleteer, do you?

18:31.235 --> 18:33.698
No, no, no, my dear.

18:33.700 --> 18:38.100
This man is positively baying to
be part of this little world...

18:38.102 --> 18:42.701
of ours, already quite seduced,
I would say.

19:15.802 --> 19:17.967
I'm sorry, Ada.

19:20.967 --> 19:23.133
What for?

19:23.135 --> 19:25.832
For this disruption,
for breaking up the home...

19:25.834 --> 19:27.099
for dragging you here.

19:27.101 --> 19:30.166
No doubts, James, no jitters.

19:30.168 --> 19:32.232
I need this promise from you.

19:32.234 --> 19:34.166
Now that it's started,
let's see it through...

19:34.168 --> 19:36.867
steadfast and resolved.

19:48.934 --> 19:51.765
<i>An appeal to
the English-reading public...</i>

19:51.767 --> 19:54.899
<i>of Great Britain, America
and the British colonies...</i>

19:54.901 --> 19:59.066
<i>to read books and make extracts
for a new dictionary...</i>

19:59.068 --> 20:01.166
<i>worthy of the English language.</i>

20:01.168 --> 20:04.999
<i>We live today knowing the
origins of the Earth...</i>

20:05.001 --> 20:07.632
<i>of man and all the animals.</i>

20:07.634 --> 20:11.066
<i>We know how hot boiling water
is, how long a yard.</i>

20:11.068 --> 20:14.999
<i>Our ships' masters know the
precise measurements...</i>

20:15.001 --> 20:16.732
<i>of latitude and longitude.</i>

20:16.734 --> 20:20.332
<i>Yet we have neither chart nor
compass to guide us...</i>

20:20.334 --> 20:22.765
<i>through the wide sea of words.</i>

20:22.767 --> 20:25.365
<i>The time has come to accord
this great language of ours...</i>

20:25.367 --> 20:28.998
<i>the same dignity and respect as
the other standards...</i>

20:29.000 --> 20:33.099
<i>defined by science. Fly your
words to Oxford.</i>

20:33.101 --> 20:37.099
<i>Let us be connected, all of us
in this great endeavour...</i>

20:37.101 --> 20:40.031
<i>through the marvellous maze
of our inter-netted post.</i>

20:40.033 --> 20:41.798
What are you doing, Father?

20:41.800 --> 20:44.366
Mr. Bradley and I are putting
a big hole in the ground.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.398
- But what for?
- For a scriptorium.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.198
That's a room like in medieval
monasteries...

20:49.200 --> 20:51.998
where monastic scribes used
to copy manuscripts.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.366
Look, look at that, look what
I found! Treasure!

20:55.368 --> 20:57.831
Will you clean that for me?

20:57.833 --> 20:59.199
Yes, Father.

20:59.201 --> 21:00.801
Aye.

21:11.201 --> 21:12.865
<i>It is a long run...</i>

21:12.867 --> 21:14.934
<i>but we can bear the language
aloft.</i>

21:16.267 --> 21:17.331
Mr. Bradley.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.864
<i>With you, our volunteers...</i>

21:19.866 --> 21:21.098
<i>as rungs in the ladder...</i>

21:21.100 --> 21:23.733
<i>we may elevate English even
unto the gates of heaven.</i>

21:40.400 --> 21:43.131
- Come on.
- Get off me!

21:43.133 --> 21:45.000
Easy.

22:03.100 --> 22:05.665
Get him off of me! Who did
that to me?

22:08.966 --> 22:11.365
Stand clear! Get out of the way!

22:11.367 --> 22:13.033
Go on, take me!

22:22.100 --> 22:27.165
Get out of the way, get back!
Get back, now, now, move, move!

22:34.900 --> 22:36.364
Look at me, look at me!

22:36.366 --> 22:38.398
Son, son, listen to me,
listen to me.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.398
We're gonna lift the gate
just a bit...

22:40.400 --> 22:42.265
let's see if you can pull
your leg through.

22:42.267 --> 22:43.696
I-I don't know, sir.

22:43.698 --> 22:45.031
We've gotta do it, son,
we gotta do it.

22:45.033 --> 22:46.931
Will you let us try?
Hey, hey?

22:46.933 --> 22:48.197
Good boy, good boy...

22:48.199 --> 22:51.066
after three, one, two...

23:03.032 --> 23:07.763
Out of my way! Out of my way!

23:07.765 --> 23:11.132
How far is the nearest
blacksmith?

23:14.132 --> 23:15.731
Crowthorne.

23:15.733 --> 23:19.097
The nearest surgeon?

23:19.099 --> 23:22.100
Crowthorne Village, it's half
an hour, there and back.

23:35.399 --> 23:40.763
I want a sharp knife and a saw.

23:40.765 --> 23:42.364
Get it up!

23:42.366 --> 23:44.199
Agh!

23:45.899 --> 23:50.930
In a half hour's time, this man
will have bled to death.

23:50.932 --> 23:52.897
- Coleman.
- Yes, sir.

23:52.899 --> 23:56.732
Get a sharp knife and a saw...
quickly!

24:11.932 --> 24:15.695
Now you listen to me, doctor,
I know who you are...

24:15.697 --> 24:16.863
and how you got in here...

24:16.865 --> 24:19.197
and believe me when I say
that none of your wealth...

24:19.199 --> 24:21.665
will do you any good if you
try anything.

24:52.898 --> 24:55.199
Your saw.

25:02.898 --> 25:05.364
You wrap the wound in boiled
rags.

25:05.366 --> 25:09.329
Keep the belt tight and get him
to a surgeon.

25:09.331 --> 25:12.029
Your ligation held,
hemorrhaging was low...

25:12.031 --> 25:14.964
his condition is delicate,
but he is alive.

25:15.664 --> 25:18.063
We are all extremely grateful
to you, Dr. Minor.

25:18.065 --> 25:20.064
Was the wound swabbed, dressed
in phenol?

25:20.066 --> 25:23.029
Luckily, our local surgeon is
well versed...

25:23.031 --> 25:25.829
in Lister's latest antisepsis
and asepsis methods...

25:25.831 --> 25:27.198
as I see are you.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.930
Rush's Tranquilizer.

25:34.932 --> 25:37.796
Dr. Rush, he was an American
Army surgeon for a time...

25:37.798 --> 25:39.029
as well, I believe.

25:39.031 --> 25:41.296
Dr. Rush believed that if the
patient could be rendered...

25:41.298 --> 25:43.962
entirely immobile during the
convulsions of mania...

25:43.964 --> 25:46.729
then madness itself would be
countered.

25:46.731 --> 25:48.298
Barbaric in its simplicity.

25:50.331 --> 25:53.163
It's a relic, really, from the
dark days of my profession...

25:53.165 --> 25:57.929
but it still has its uses when
combined with modern techniques.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.163
You think I'm insane.

26:00.165 --> 26:03.396
Are we not all, to some extent?

26:03.398 --> 26:08.662
You do experience yourself as
being under threat, do you not?

26:08.664 --> 26:13.929
A man... is coming for me.

26:13.931 --> 26:17.129
From my confinement, I will not
see him come.

26:17.131 --> 26:22.263
So if you will permit me,
I would ask your vigilance.

26:22.265 --> 26:26.131
And that you have your men
alert me.

26:27.763 --> 26:30.096
He is easily identifiable.

26:30.098 --> 26:36.895
He has a brand mark on the left
side of his face.

26:36.897 --> 26:40.229
Dr. Minor, rest assured we will
do everything...

26:40.231 --> 26:43.228
in our power to ensure your
safety.

26:43.230 --> 26:47.062
Is there anything else I can
help you with?

26:47.064 --> 26:50.828
I have a pension from the United
States Army.

26:50.830 --> 26:54.063
I wish that the greater portion
of it...

26:54.065 --> 26:58.128
be given to Mrs. Merrett
in support of her children.

26:58.130 --> 27:00.928
Well, I'm sure that can be
arranged.

27:00.930 --> 27:05.063
Sir? I'd like to take care
of that personally.

27:05.065 --> 27:07.962
There you are, Dr. Minor.

27:07.964 --> 27:09.862
You have our very best man
on the case.

27:09.864 --> 27:11.697
Thank you, Mr. Muncie.

27:33.630 --> 27:35.830
There are children
sleeping here.

27:37.663 --> 27:39.795
Only a letter to deliver, ma'am.

27:39.797 --> 27:41.961
Bit late for the post,
ain't it?

27:41.963 --> 27:43.262
You lot are terrible liars.

27:43.264 --> 27:46.895
I'm not from the papers, or the
police, I'm not.

27:46.897 --> 27:48.661
Not here to bother you at all.

27:48.663 --> 27:52.162
I needed to make sure you got
it right personal.

27:52.164 --> 27:54.630
I'll just slide it under the
door.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.961
I'm not from the papers.

28:00.963 --> 28:02.195
Who are you, then?

28:02.197 --> 28:06.897
I'm Muncie, ma'am, I'm hoping
to help.

28:10.097 --> 28:11.661
Is this from you?

28:11.663 --> 28:15.095
No, ma'am, the letter will
explain.

28:15.097 --> 28:17.064
Who's it from?

28:35.164 --> 28:37.228
She wouldn't consider it.

28:37.230 --> 28:40.030
Thank you, Mr. Muncie.

28:50.330 --> 28:52.361
Look again, we must have it.

28:52.363 --> 28:54.394
I have looked and we do not...

28:54.396 --> 28:57.294
I have quotes for it in the
14th, the 15th...

28:57.296 --> 29:01.027
the 16th and the 19th, but not
in the 17th and 18th centuries.

29:01.029 --> 29:02.128
How is that possible?

29:02.130 --> 29:04.627
How can Ruskin write "The
sculpture is approved...

29:04.629 --> 29:06.828
"and set off by the color"
in 1849?

29:06.830 --> 29:10.760
How can I, now use it everyday,
if you are telling me...

29:10.762 --> 29:12.328
that it vanished in the 17th
Century.

29:12.330 --> 29:13.994
Where did it go for 200 years?

29:13.996 --> 29:16.361
I am not saying that it
vanished, sir.

29:16.363 --> 29:19.627
I am simply saying that we do
not have proof.

29:19.629 --> 29:21.161
Look again, Charles.

29:21.163 --> 29:23.094
And where exactly would you like
me to look, sir...

29:23.096 --> 29:27.262
in the birthday cards, perhaps
or the medicinal instructions...

29:27.264 --> 29:28.727
or the How-to manuals...

29:28.729 --> 29:31.061
or perhaps the Guy Fawkes
day messages?

29:31.063 --> 29:33.827
And we're only just dealing
with "A" here.

29:33.829 --> 29:37.327
What of B, C, D, E, F,
G, H, I, J, K?

29:37.329 --> 29:39.094
It's bloody hopeless, sir!

29:39.096 --> 29:44.161
Mr. Hall! Please try to maintain
a semblance of decorum.

29:44.163 --> 29:47.227
Henry, what exactly is the
problem here?

29:47.229 --> 29:50.994
It's "Approve", sir. There is a
missing link.

29:50.996 --> 29:52.727
To say nothing of "Art".

29:52.729 --> 29:56.361
We're missing "Approve" in the
17th and 18th centuries.

29:56.363 --> 29:57.693
We can't find a single trace
of it.

29:57.695 --> 29:59.994
Look at Paradise Lost.

29:59.996 --> 30:01.693
The language took a crucial turn
with Milton.

30:01.695 --> 30:03.660
He was somewhat of a purist...

30:03.662 --> 30:06.660
re-affirming the meaning of his
English.

30:06.662 --> 30:07.993
The key would be in there.
Try that.

30:07.995 --> 30:10.627
Perhaps we can skip the 17th
century, sir.

30:10.629 --> 30:14.261
We have its birth in 1380 with
John Wyclif.

30:14.263 --> 30:17.061
"Christ confirmed his law and
with his death approved it."

30:17.063 --> 30:18.993
And we have Ruskin here
in this century.

30:18.995 --> 30:21.993
Mr. Bradley, we must have every
step.

30:21.995 --> 30:24.626
This is not about the centuries.

30:24.628 --> 30:27.894
This is about recording the
evolution of meaning.

30:27.896 --> 30:30.293
Go to Milton, it's right here.

30:30.295 --> 30:32.961
Yes, sir.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.727
Mr. Bradley.

30:43.729 --> 30:45.028
Charles.

30:50.728 --> 30:52.929
Accepted.

31:06.896 --> 31:09.026
Razor! Bring me my razor!

31:09.028 --> 31:12.659
Sir Richard! Calm down!

31:12.661 --> 31:14.626
The razor, bring me my razor!

31:14.628 --> 31:16.029
Lads, bloody well hurry up!

31:17.295 --> 31:19.695
Bring it, bring me the razor!

31:20.995 --> 31:24.062
- Bring me the razor!
- Come on, hurry up!

31:26.095 --> 31:29.360
Father! Father! Father! Father!

31:29.362 --> 31:32.928
Father! Father! Father!

31:34.728 --> 31:37.861
This man, Declan
Reilly, is a deserter.

31:44.928 --> 31:47.195
Mark him for what he is.

32:12.861 --> 32:15.294
Agh!

32:17.061 --> 32:19.594
Agh!

32:29.628 --> 32:32.193
Zinc... I'll need sheets
of zinc...

32:32.195 --> 32:34.959
he must have come from below.

32:34.961 --> 32:38.359
And water, in a bowl, by the
threshold.

32:38.361 --> 32:41.092
This, the demon will not pass.

32:41.094 --> 32:42.692
What's on the other side,
doctor?

32:42.694 --> 32:45.360
The night, he wants to take me
there.

32:45.362 --> 32:49.691
With his blind eyes, he can only
see me in the dark.

32:49.693 --> 32:52.292
How would you feel if we
brightened the light?

32:52.294 --> 32:53.292
As treatment?

32:53.294 --> 32:54.892
I don't need treatment!

32:54.894 --> 32:57.059
Not as treatment! As an
experiment!

32:57.061 --> 32:59.360
I need to see him come so I can
defend myself!

32:59.362 --> 33:02.893
An experiment in
self-protection...

33:02.895 --> 33:07.292
we embark on together, doctor,
yes?

33:07.294 --> 33:09.326
Let me take a look at these.

33:09.328 --> 33:11.925
Superficial lacerations,
multiple to the face.

33:11.927 --> 33:13.993
How would you feel, doctor...

33:13.995 --> 33:19.626
if we were to introduce some
of the comforts of home?

33:19.628 --> 33:22.658
Orthognathous jaw, facial angle,
80 degrees...

33:22.660 --> 33:26.625
maybe some clothing.
Amativeness, 8 incline...

33:26.627 --> 33:28.691
Philoprogenitiveness, 4 decline.

33:28.693 --> 33:30.025
How would that be?

33:30.027 --> 33:31.792
My own wardrobe as protection?

33:31.794 --> 33:36.192
As protection, precisely.
Adhesiveness, 3 constant.

33:36.194 --> 33:39.925
Combativeness, 6 incline.
Secretiveness, 8.

33:39.927 --> 33:42.392
Hope, 4, constant.

33:42.394 --> 33:46.159
Yes, the simple things that we
can fit into your surroundings.

33:46.161 --> 33:48.758
It also happens that the
adjoining cell...

33:48.760 --> 33:52.159
has become available, you could
stretch your legs.

33:52.161 --> 33:54.392
It would give me a space
to paint.

33:54.394 --> 33:56.159
I could have easels with paints.

33:56.161 --> 34:02.658
Certainly. Wonder, Ideality,
Wit, Form. All 8, decline.

34:02.660 --> 34:05.957
Eventuality undetermined. Do you
have any other requests, doctor?

34:05.959 --> 34:08.657
My books. May I have my books?

34:08.659 --> 34:09.824
By all means, anything else?

34:09.827 --> 34:11.324
My gun.

34:11.327 --> 34:14.158
Perhaps we'll give that one
a miss.

34:14.159 --> 34:15.292
Thank you, doctor.

34:15.293 --> 34:17.259
Please, don't thank me.

34:17.261 --> 34:19.059
It has been a long time since
anyone has...

34:19.061 --> 34:24.858
My dear friend, no thanks, no
thanks...

34:24.860 --> 34:27.293
a new beginning.

34:30.060 --> 34:33.859
Yes, a new beginning, yes.

34:34.127 --> 34:37.891
<i>How can a man of
such high breeding...</i>

34:37.893 --> 34:50.891
<i>have regressed through disease
so far back to animality?</i>

34:50.893 --> 34:52.293
Doctor?

34:54.159 --> 34:55.292
Mr. Muncie?

34:55.293 --> 34:58.657
We wanted to give you this, sir,
the lads all chipped in.

34:58.659 --> 35:01.358
And what have we here?

35:01.360 --> 35:06.625
It's a book, sir. We're all
grateful to you.

35:06.627 --> 35:08.791
Yes, it is. Thank you,
Mr. Muncie.

35:08.793 --> 35:11.192
For saving a young guard's life,
sir.

35:11.194 --> 35:15.957
I will read it avidly and I will
treasure it forever!

35:15.959 --> 35:18.957
You thank your men on my behalf!

35:18.959 --> 35:20.724
Merry Christmas, sir.

35:20.726 --> 35:23.293
Merry Christmas, you, too, yes.

35:27.794 --> 35:30.627
Ham, Mr. Muncie!

35:31.759 --> 35:33.291
Sir?

35:33.293 --> 35:38.791
I find that a good, warm ham is
often better...

35:38.793 --> 35:41.191
for fighting the cold than any
number of blankets...

35:41.193 --> 35:45.926
or coals in the fire, especially
at this time of year.

35:49.293 --> 35:50.757
Did he like the book, sir?

35:50.759 --> 35:52.158
- The book?
- Yeah.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.623
- I don't know.
- Well, has he read it?

35:54.625 --> 35:56.291
- Well, he opened the wrapping.
- Yes, sir.

35:56.293 --> 35:58.357
- And then he opened the book.
- Yes.

35:58.359 --> 36:00.924
And then he threw it out
the window.

36:00.926 --> 36:01.924
He what?

36:01.926 --> 36:03.956
Yeah, he said a demon vaporized
off the page...

36:03.958 --> 36:05.158
and went up his nostrils.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.224
His nostrils?

36:06.226 --> 36:08.859
He's in there now trying to pull
out his nose hairs.

36:28.059 --> 36:31.623
<i>To chart the life
of each word, we must start...</i>

36:31.625 --> 36:35.390
<i>with a record of its birth,
when it was first written down.</i>

36:35.392 --> 36:38.624
<i>From there, words come down to
us through the ages...</i>

36:38.626 --> 36:40.856
<i>twisting and turning, weaving
their way.</i>

36:40.858 --> 36:43.623
<i>Their meanings slipping and
slivering, offishlike, adding..</i>

36:43.625 --> 36:47.290
<i>and shedding subtleties of
nuance to and from themselves.</i>

36:47.292 --> 36:49.624
<i>But they leave tracks...</i>

36:49.626 --> 36:53.023
<i>in the great expanse of the
literature...</i>

36:53.025 --> 36:54.823
<i>of the English language.</i>

36:58.658 --> 37:00.857
<i>We will chase
them, hunt them...</i>

37:00.859 --> 37:05.290
<i>and ferret them out, all
of them, every single word...</i>

37:05.292 --> 37:07.224
<i>from all the centuries
of writing...</i>

37:07.226 --> 37:10.892
<i>and we will do so by reading
every single book.</i>

37:14.625 --> 37:17.592
Can it be done?

37:22.392 --> 37:26.390
You crazy, beautiful bastard!

37:26.392 --> 37:28.725
Guard! Guard!

37:31.658 --> 37:33.123
Ink, I'll need ink.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.057
Yes, sir, I understand, sir.

37:35.059 --> 37:37.123
- Paper.
- Yes, sir.

37:37.125 --> 37:39.823
- Lots and lots of it.
- I'll see what I can do, doctor.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.390
And Coleman...

37:42.392 --> 37:44.057
Yes, sir?

37:44.059 --> 37:49.957
Would you be so kind as to
dispose of this for me?

37:52.292 --> 37:53.923
What is it, sir?

37:53.925 --> 37:55.192
You can't see?

37:57.892 --> 38:00.257
Yes... of course, I can, sir...

38:00.259 --> 38:03.023
Yes, nasal hair, mind the
demonic vapors...

38:03.025 --> 38:04.290
make sure to wash your hands...

38:04.292 --> 38:07.225
and I'll make sure to fish out
some more later.

38:09.691 --> 38:12.224
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Coleman.

38:16.824 --> 38:19.622
I'm too cold. I'm gonna get
myself home.

38:19.624 --> 38:22.222
We'll warm each other up,
come on.

38:22.224 --> 38:25.390
- I'm too cold.
- Oh, you got a smile.

38:25.392 --> 38:27.889
- I can't, it's too cold!
- Come on!

38:27.891 --> 38:30.357
No!

38:30.359 --> 38:33.389
No, no, you promised me!
You promised me!

38:33.391 --> 38:36.056
Get off, I don't owe you
nothing!

38:36.058 --> 38:39.722
What am I meant to feed my
little ones with, eh?

38:39.724 --> 38:42.958
I don't know, ask their father.

39:04.690 --> 39:07.024
How are them matches coming, eh?

39:14.391 --> 39:17.222
Mum, you alright?

39:17.224 --> 39:19.824
Yeah, yeah, I just needed
a moment.

39:43.058 --> 39:45.155
Please, can I help you?

39:45.157 --> 39:47.055
It'll be alright.

39:47.057 --> 39:49.389
Good evening, I was
wondering, is your mum around?

39:49.391 --> 39:51.791
We'll get those matches done
by night's end.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.789
It's a man at the door.

39:54.791 --> 39:57.190
Tell him it's Christmas and
he'll go away.

40:03.689 --> 40:05.855
Could you just give her
this for me...

40:05.857 --> 40:09.121
and tell your mother Happy
Christmas from Mr. Muncie?

40:09.123 --> 40:11.157
Goodnight, girls.

40:12.324 --> 40:14.557
Mum?

40:18.690 --> 40:21.188
It's a ham in one, the other,
he didn't say.

40:21.190 --> 40:23.088
He said tell your mum
Happy Christmas.

40:23.090 --> 40:24.854
Happy Christmas from Mr. Muncie.

40:24.856 --> 40:30.556
It's alright then, isn't it,
Mum?

40:35.757 --> 40:39.687
Sir, stop, sir, please!

40:39.689 --> 40:40.888
Yes, dear?

40:47.956 --> 40:49.754
Is that supposed to be me?

40:49.756 --> 40:51.723
Yeah.

40:55.957 --> 40:57.988
Good night, then, Mrs. Merrett.

40:57.990 --> 41:00.890
Good night... and thank you.

41:05.390 --> 41:06.954
Forgive me for saying, ma'am...

41:06.956 --> 41:11.821
but it doesn't have to be
this way.

41:11.823 --> 41:13.355
The children... they don't need
to go hungry.

41:13.357 --> 41:17.224
There is one waiting to feed
them.

41:21.390 --> 41:23.687
Take me to him.

41:23.689 --> 41:28.721
Let me look him in the eye,
see if I can stomach him.

41:28.723 --> 41:31.121
I went to a banquet
and I ate apples...

41:31.123 --> 41:33.355
bananas, and cranberries.

41:33.357 --> 41:38.321
I went to the banquet and I ate
apples...

41:38.323 --> 41:40.721
bananas, cranberries, and...
dog.

41:40.723 --> 41:43.121
That can't be, you can't eat
dog.

41:43.123 --> 41:44.221
Yes, I can.

41:44.223 --> 41:46.188
No, you can't.

41:46.190 --> 41:52.255
Mum! Mother! Mum?

42:17.389 --> 42:18.856
Merry Christmas all!

42:20.356 --> 42:23.955
Hey! We're taking fire,
Mr. Bradley!

42:25.922 --> 42:27.157
Pounce on them!

42:34.189 --> 42:35.955
Ah, you wee...!

42:46.222 --> 42:47.955
Well, you deserved it.

42:51.989 --> 42:54.620
Faster!

42:54.622 --> 42:57.953
Do you remember our first
Christmas at the school?

42:57.955 --> 43:01.853
Harold was no more than 8 or 9
months old.

43:01.855 --> 43:06.853
Such a fat, little baby. Do you
remember how he used to cry?

43:06.855 --> 43:08.686
Oh, god.

43:08.688 --> 43:11.621
One night, he was screaming so
hard...

43:11.623 --> 43:14.820
I don't know how his little body
could do it.

43:14.822 --> 43:19.220
Every ounce of him shrieking.
Nothing I tried would calm him.

43:19.222 --> 43:23.753
I was frightened, then you
came home.

43:23.755 --> 43:26.187
You lifted him up into your
arms...

43:26.189 --> 43:30.588
you held him to your chest,
and he stopped.

43:31.688 --> 43:36.154
He was so exhausted he fell
asleep instantly.

43:36.156 --> 43:41.219
It's always been that way,
with all of them.

43:41.221 --> 43:44.087
You had something I didn't.

43:44.089 --> 43:48.220
So I taught myself to be what
you were not.

43:48.222 --> 43:51.320
Strict, fixed, changeless.

43:51.322 --> 43:55.820
A queen and a clown, together
a perfect whole.

43:55.822 --> 43:57.154
What if it changed?

43:57.156 --> 44:00.156
What if you're not there
to be the clown?

44:02.189 --> 44:04.787
I know I've been less than
present lately...

44:04.789 --> 44:09.119
but change will come,
and for the better.

44:09.121 --> 44:12.687
I wish I had your certainty.

44:18.355 --> 44:22.187
Want to put the fire out when
you come to bed?

44:30.655 --> 44:32.886
Ah, I thought you might be here,
sir.

44:32.888 --> 44:35.719
I have a few hours before my
little ones wake...

44:35.721 --> 44:37.320
for Christmas morning.

44:37.322 --> 44:39.020
I thought I might take another
look at Approve.

44:39.022 --> 44:41.587
That'll make it two of us.

44:50.687 --> 44:54.654
William? Dr. Minor?

44:56.988 --> 44:59.685
I have a proposal for you.

44:59.687 --> 45:01.287
There's been a request
for a meeting.

45:01.289 --> 45:06.887
Tristram Shandy, a gift from Mr.
Muncie and his men...

45:06.889 --> 45:09.754
but much more.

45:11.888 --> 45:13.086
This is very delicate.

45:13.088 --> 45:16.286
I'll need books, far more
volumes...

45:16.288 --> 45:17.919
than I have within my own reach.

45:17.921 --> 45:21.653
William, I think this could be
very important for us.

45:21.655 --> 45:24.153
Oxford University has undertaken
an inventory...

45:24.155 --> 45:30.021
of the entire English language,
and they've asked for help.

45:31.121 --> 45:33.255
Are you listening to me?

45:38.821 --> 45:45.654
I'll be all right... with work,
with this work.

45:47.687 --> 45:53.085
I'll be all right, but I need
books...

45:53.087 --> 45:55.754
I only need books.

45:57.686 --> 46:00.286
Make me a list of all the titles
that you require.

46:00.288 --> 46:03.619
If I have them, I'll get them
sent to you.

46:03.621 --> 46:05.154
Thank you, doctor.

46:10.188 --> 46:11.820
William...

46:19.887 --> 46:22.288
When does she want to come?

46:32.120 --> 46:33.853
Mrs. Merrett.

46:37.787 --> 46:40.819
- Where is he?
- It should only be a moment.

46:40.821 --> 46:44.386
I just wanted to make sure that
everyone was breathing.

46:44.388 --> 46:48.253
There's a real generosity
in your visit today...

46:48.255 --> 46:52.919
Mrs. Merrett... a true courage.

46:52.921 --> 46:55.320
Courage, doctor, is not
why I came.

47:14.020 --> 47:18.553
Is it... is it possible
they wait?

47:36.987 --> 47:39.020
The letter.

47:39.787 --> 47:41.154
Yes.

47:45.287 --> 47:47.020
All right.

47:48.953 --> 47:50.085
How can...

47:50.087 --> 47:51.651
We'll take care of everything,
sir.

47:51.653 --> 47:54.053
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you, Mrs. Merrett.

47:59.054 --> 48:01.286
It doesn't make it right.

48:04.686 --> 48:08.052
What would you care to send her?

48:08.054 --> 48:10.018
Everything.

48:31.719 --> 48:34.118
<i>Few of the
earliest books have been read.</i>

48:34.120 --> 48:36.985
<i>It is in the 17th and 18th
Centuries above all...</i>

48:36.987 --> 48:41.817
<i>that help is urgently needed,
for nearly the whole...</i>

48:41.819 --> 48:44.850
<i>of those centuries have still
to be gone through.</i>

48:44.852 --> 48:47.351
<i>You may concentrate on the
rare, also late...</i>

48:47.353 --> 48:50.985
<i>old-fashioned new and peculiar,
but avoid not the quotidian...</i>

48:50.987 --> 48:54.618
<i>for every word in action
becomes beautiful...</i>

48:54.620 --> 48:56.619
<i>in the light of its own
meaning.</i>

49:07.752 --> 49:12.585
Mr. Muncie! Mr. Muncie!

49:15.053 --> 49:18.019
Sorry to have woken you, I need
your help with a post.

49:20.353 --> 49:23.719
Yes, well, is it night?

49:28.153 --> 49:32.117
Such a lot of it, need
envelopes, tons...

49:32.119 --> 49:35.617
lots and lots of envelopes
and a large bag.

49:35.619 --> 49:36.683
Yes, sir.

49:36.685 --> 49:38.217
And a carpenter, can you bring
a carpenter by...

49:38.219 --> 49:40.119
in the morning, of course?

50:08.219 --> 50:10.217
Good morning, sir.

50:10.219 --> 50:12.617
Not so good I'm afraid, Henry.

50:12.619 --> 50:15.150
It's Art, none of it is working.

50:15.152 --> 50:17.150
Are you sure, sir? I checked it
myself last night.

50:17.152 --> 50:20.950
The construct is off. It has
lost all sense of coherence.

50:20.952 --> 50:23.316
And it's missing countless
variations of meaning.

50:23.318 --> 50:24.483
We'll have to start it anew.

50:24.485 --> 50:28.016
But, sir, it will take weeks
just to reset the definitions.

50:28.018 --> 50:31.151
Mr. Gell has asked for me at the
Press office this morning.

50:31.153 --> 50:34.117
I would very much like to see
Art torn apart...

50:34.119 --> 50:37.850
and restarted when I return, eh?

50:37.852 --> 50:39.750
Very well, sir.

50:39.752 --> 50:41.318
Thank you, Henry.

50:52.719 --> 50:54.384
Your book, Mr. Murray, is
going to be an unassailable...

50:54.386 --> 50:56.016
contribution to English
scholarship.

50:56.018 --> 50:58.949
It will make you famous,
when it is finished.

50:58.951 --> 51:00.884
Look around, Mr. Murray.

51:00.886 --> 51:05.316
Empire, one quarter of the land
and peoples of this earth.

51:05.318 --> 51:08.816
The largest trading dominion
ever known.

51:08.818 --> 51:11.916
If one wishes to participate,
one bows down to Her Majesty...

51:11.918 --> 51:15.152
and one speaks her tongue,
English.

51:16.685 --> 51:18.716
Forgive me, Mr. Gell...

51:18.718 --> 51:20.783
remind me why I am being kept
from my work this morning.

51:20.785 --> 51:22.252
The Bible, Mr. Murray.

51:24.985 --> 51:27.150
I was brought onto the press...

51:27.152 --> 51:30.949
to modernize the commerce of
academia, to sell.

51:30.951 --> 51:34.016
And do you know what the first
hotcake I found was?

51:34.018 --> 51:35.716
The King James Bible...

51:35.718 --> 51:38.749
it has sold everywhere, in every
backwater and morass...

51:38.751 --> 51:41.283
where an Englishman is doing
God's work in a frock.

51:41.285 --> 51:43.883
We have operations on every
continent.

51:43.885 --> 51:46.783
Depots in Edinburgh, Toronto,
Melbourne and Calcutta.

51:46.785 --> 51:49.149
All printing, binding,
dispatching all advertising...

51:49.151 --> 51:51.815
and all, now, ready for the next
good book.

51:51.817 --> 51:54.283
All waiting... for you.

51:54.285 --> 51:55.716
What is this?

51:55.718 --> 51:57.183
Your work is taking too long.

51:57.185 --> 51:58.716
Our expectations constantly
revised...

51:58.718 --> 52:00.716
and not a single page to show
for it.

52:00.718 --> 52:02.882
The delegates have unanimously
agreed that I take charge...

52:02.884 --> 52:04.882
of keeping the project to time.

52:04.884 --> 52:07.250
To that effect, you have in your
hands a set of suggestions...

52:07.252 --> 52:10.249
on how to curb the scope
of the work.

52:10.251 --> 52:12.783
What we need is more rigorous
selection...

52:12.785 --> 52:15.051
survival only of the fittest
words.

52:21.185 --> 52:25.651
I'm tired. My team, we are all
beyond tired.

52:27.151 --> 52:30.150
For months now, my pleas for
help have fallen on deaf ears.

52:30.152 --> 52:31.316
You have refused to pay...

52:31.318 --> 52:33.985
for even for a single additional
assistant.

52:35.317 --> 52:38.182
I began this intending to create
something unprecedented.

52:38.184 --> 52:40.615
To order the world of words...

52:40.617 --> 52:44.116
making them universally
accessible and useful.

52:44.118 --> 52:47.115
I swore that I would bend at
nothing to make it happen.

52:47.117 --> 52:51.915
And as of now, this very moment,
my resolve is greater than ever.

52:51.917 --> 52:53.848
You are on the verge of all out
cancellation.

52:53.850 --> 52:55.915
These rules are designed to help
keep the work going.

52:55.917 --> 52:57.282
You may not like them, Mr.
Murray...

52:57.284 --> 52:58.681
but what other way is there?

52:58.683 --> 53:01.149
My way, Mr. Gell.

53:01.151 --> 53:05.848
Mr. Murray, we are watching
with a concerned eye.

53:05.850 --> 53:09.282
Watch, then, and be amazed.

53:19.683 --> 53:23.317
Lord in Heaven help me.
I am lost.

53:24.883 --> 53:29.149
Sir! Sir! Sir?

53:29.151 --> 53:30.282
What?

53:30.284 --> 53:34.082
It's a miracle, it's impossible.

53:34.084 --> 53:35.681
Calm down, man, spit it out.

53:35.683 --> 53:38.915
- Approve, sir, it's complete.
- Complete?

53:38.917 --> 53:40.115
You were right, sir.

53:40.117 --> 53:42.382
"Others who approve not to
transgress by thy example"...

53:42.384 --> 53:43.314
Milton, Paradise Lost.

53:43.316 --> 53:44.149
You found it.

53:44.151 --> 53:46.181
No, not us, sir. You better read
this.

53:46.183 --> 53:48.748
It is with a great sense
of privilege...

53:48.750 --> 53:51.082
that I offer myself up
as a volunteer.

53:51.084 --> 53:52.781
Please, sir, read on.

53:52.783 --> 53:56.149
<i>Enclosed please
find one-thousand word slips...</i>

53:56.151 --> 53:58.815
<i>with corresponding
quotations...</i>

53:58.817 --> 54:02.149
<i>from the height and depth
of literature.</i>

54:02.151 --> 54:06.848
<i>I have derived a key, a type
of dictionary...</i>

54:06.850 --> 54:10.648
<i>within a dictionary, that
allows the amassing of words...</i>

54:10.650 --> 54:13.048
<i>with addended quotations.</i>

54:13.050 --> 54:15.115
<i>My request is simple.</i>

54:15.117 --> 54:17.747
<i>To make your burden light.</i>

54:17.749 --> 54:22.681
<i>Write to me, tell me what
specific words at present...</i>

54:22.683 --> 54:25.617
<i>shimmer and fade at your grasp.</i>

54:27.284 --> 54:29.315
<i>Let useful others troll the
oceans...</i>

54:29.317 --> 54:32.614
<i>with their nets cast wide.</i>

54:32.616 --> 54:36.181
<i>I shall throw my line and pluck
the very quotes...</i>

54:36.183 --> 54:40.284
<i>that evade you when you call
upon me to do so.</i>

54:43.084 --> 54:48.617
<i>Very truly yours, W.C. Minor,
Crowthorne, Berkshire.</i>

54:50.283 --> 54:51.416
Look, it's all there.

54:51.418 --> 54:55.647
He's given us Approve in the
17th and 18th centuries.

54:55.649 --> 54:56.348
And Art?

54:56.350 --> 54:58.614
Not that one, but so much else.

54:58.616 --> 55:01.081
All in the "A" s, all words
we're working on...

55:01.083 --> 55:03.749
and at first glance all
of it usable.

55:05.749 --> 55:07.215
God has sent us a savior.

55:07.217 --> 55:09.647
Now all we have to do is try to
keep up with him.

55:09.649 --> 55:11.714
Thank you, Mr. Hall.

55:11.716 --> 55:14.649
Let's have a good look
at these slips.

55:16.749 --> 55:18.081
Sort these now.

55:18.083 --> 55:20.214
<i>You cannot fathom
the impact of both...</i>

55:20.216 --> 55:24.081
<i>your offer and your timing.
I am your grateful recipient.</i>

55:24.083 --> 55:27.281
<i>Let paper and ink be our flesh
and blood...</i>

55:27.283 --> 55:28.781
<i>until we are privileged
to meet.</i>

55:28.783 --> 55:29.947
That's right.

55:29.949 --> 55:31.680
<i>Enclosed are a
list of words that...</i>

55:31.682 --> 55:34.614
<i>at present... are eluding us.</i>

55:34.616 --> 55:38.316
<i>The word Art is proving
particularly troublesome.</i>

55:39.949 --> 55:42.280
<i>Enclosed you will
find the quotations...</i>

55:42.282 --> 55:44.081
<i>that you have requested.</i>

55:44.083 --> 55:47.880
<i>In pondering "Art", I am
reminded of the words...</i>

55:47.882 --> 55:50.746
<i>of a great man of our time
who said...</i>

55:50.748 --> 55:56.347
<i>all great and beautiful work
has come of first gazing...</i>

55:56.349 --> 55:59.248
<i>without shrinking into the
darkness.</i>

55:59.250 --> 56:00.980
May I, sir?

56:00.982 --> 56:02.116
Aye.

56:03.316 --> 56:04.715
Ah.

56:11.082 --> 56:14.679
<i>I have been much
acquainted with that darkness.</i>

56:14.681 --> 56:18.981
<i>Thank you for letting me lend
my light to yours.</i>

56:18.983 --> 56:22.213
<i>Together we shall shrink the
darkness...</i>

56:22.215 --> 56:24.880
<i>until there is only light.</i>

56:24.882 --> 56:30.050
<i>Yours, W.C. Minor. Crowthorne,
Berkshire.</i>

56:33.783 --> 56:37.115
Ah, here it is... heh-heh, eh.

56:45.315 --> 56:47.982
Now we'll put your name on it,
too.

56:51.149 --> 56:54.713
Mr. Bradley, can I have another
fascicle, please?

56:54.715 --> 56:59.548
I know of another who's joy in
seeing it would be immeasurable.

57:03.748 --> 57:05.679
Yes, ma'am.

57:05.681 --> 57:07.813
Is Mr. Muncie working?

57:07.815 --> 57:09.047
He is.

57:09.049 --> 57:11.946
Could you please tell him Mrs.
Merrett is here to see him?

57:11.948 --> 57:13.813
I will indeed, ma'am.

57:23.848 --> 57:25.247
Hello, ma'am.

57:25.249 --> 57:26.815
Mr. Muncie.

57:30.382 --> 57:32.912
So pleased you've
returned, Mrs. Merrett.

57:32.914 --> 57:35.646
Come on in then, ma'am.

57:35.648 --> 57:39.615
It's... very interesting.

57:45.315 --> 57:47.282
Come in, doctor.

57:57.048 --> 57:59.147
Mrs. Merrett has brought you
a book.

57:59.149 --> 58:03.213
Yes... from Maggs, the book
shop.

58:03.215 --> 58:04.982
I was told you like to read.

58:08.048 --> 58:09.581
Thank you.

58:10.947 --> 58:13.347
Would you care to take a walk
on the grounds, madam?

58:13.349 --> 58:15.647
It is a beautiful spring day.

58:19.181 --> 58:21.281
Did you read it?

58:23.081 --> 58:27.312
Great Expectations, the book you
brought me? Is it a favorite?

58:27.314 --> 58:30.746
No, no, the shop suggested it.

58:30.748 --> 58:32.214
Ah.

58:34.114 --> 58:37.315
I came to say... thank you.

58:40.714 --> 58:44.046
The children, they're not going
hungry no more.

58:44.048 --> 58:47.212
They've got warm clothes now,
even for next year, but...

58:47.214 --> 58:49.179
It's never too late with
children.

58:49.181 --> 58:50.814
Their whole lives are tomorrows.

58:53.381 --> 58:58.613
But I can't go on taking your
money. It's... it's not right.

58:58.615 --> 59:01.146
- Please, Mrs. Merrett.
- It's blood money.

59:01.148 --> 59:06.112
I know, but it's my blood, too.
My life belongs to you.

59:06.114 --> 59:08.079
I made it so on that night.

59:08.081 --> 59:10.112
I took a life and by dreadful
bargain...

59:10.114 --> 59:11.845
I've placed another in your
hands.

59:11.847 --> 59:13.614
By right, all that I have
is yours.

59:17.113 --> 59:21.580
I don't know what to think.
I don't know why I came.

59:23.248 --> 59:26.014
Mrs. Merrett, please!

59:29.314 --> 59:32.680
Well, let me know if she
comes back.

59:34.713 --> 59:37.281
Let's have a look at those
chains.

59:55.880 --> 59:57.047
Thank you.

59:58.114 --> 59:59.611
Can I help you, sir?

59:59.613 --> 01:00:01.611
Yes, I'm here to see the
superintendent.

01:00:01.613 --> 01:00:02.644
Are you expected?

01:00:02.646 --> 01:00:04.211
No, I came on impulse.

01:00:04.213 --> 01:00:07.612
I'm James Murray, I am a friend
of Dr. Minor's...

01:00:07.614 --> 01:00:09.145
yet only through the post.

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:12.312
Dr. Minor, the superintendent.

01:00:12.314 --> 01:00:15.311
Ah, ah, I came to bring him this
fruit of our labor.

01:00:15.313 --> 01:00:17.812
I know who you are, sir.

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:22.346
I posted all the letters for
him. I licked the stamps myself.

01:00:22.348 --> 01:00:25.081
Oh, thank you, for your mother
tongue.

01:00:26.679 --> 01:00:28.546
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:37.246
- So this is the good doctor?
- Mr. Murray, sir.

01:00:37.248 --> 01:00:41.247
Dr. Minor, I'm proud to make
your acquaintance, sir.

01:00:59.113 --> 01:01:00.644
I cannot believe my eyes.

01:01:00.646 --> 01:01:03.114
Nor I, nor this surprise.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.944
How did you gain entrance?

01:01:06.946 --> 01:01:11.111
I came on the off chance and to
bring you this.

01:01:11.113 --> 01:01:12.744
Our gathering, so far.

01:01:12.746 --> 01:01:15.245
Meek, but poised to inherit
the earth.

01:01:15.247 --> 01:01:18.780
I thank you. You deserve
to be proud.

01:01:19.946 --> 01:01:21.078
Dumbfounded.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.278
You've been a bulwark for us,
doctor.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.245
I'm happy to be of assistance...

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:28.144
though I am merely worker to the
queen. The alveary is yours.

01:01:28.146 --> 01:01:30.644
Ah, you sent the quote for
alveary? From...

01:01:30.646 --> 01:01:31.677
Baret, 1580.

01:01:31.679 --> 01:01:33.311
Of course, the early
dictionaries of English...

01:01:33.313 --> 01:01:36.111
Latin, French and Greek,
but of course, you know that.

01:01:36.113 --> 01:01:37.344
Of course, I don't.

01:01:37.346 --> 01:01:41.144
I do know the poets. You, in
your letters, know the scribe.

01:01:41.146 --> 01:01:43.877
Now my task is to de-scribe.

01:01:43.879 --> 01:01:46.978
Alveary, such a lovely buzz
to it.

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:50.210
How about cosh, or fettle?

01:01:50.212 --> 01:01:53.144
Fine. Louche.

01:01:53.146 --> 01:01:54.245
I remember that from childhood.

01:01:54.247 --> 01:01:56.211
It always seemed undressed.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:58.078
Commotrix, I adore that one...

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.245
sounds as though it wants
trouble.

01:02:00.247 --> 01:02:02.744
Troublesome indeed, and
difficult to find.

01:02:02.746 --> 01:02:03.978
Gyre.

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:06.378
A revolution, a whirl.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.378
Decussated.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:10.111
Formed by crossing lines, an X,
an intersection.

01:02:10.113 --> 01:02:12.344
Perhaps you should be writing
definitions and I...

01:02:12.346 --> 01:02:16.811
well, I'd be useless tending
to your patients.

01:02:16.813 --> 01:02:19.676
So let's leave it as it is.

01:02:19.678 --> 01:02:22.877
We've only just started.
Partners, word for word.

01:02:22.879 --> 01:02:25.244
An American and a Scot?

01:02:25.246 --> 01:02:29.077
How does an American come to eye
these gates?

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:31.777
A story for another day.

01:02:31.779 --> 01:02:34.044
Let's continue the comparison.

01:02:34.046 --> 01:02:35.877
One Oxford, one Yale.

01:02:35.879 --> 01:02:37.011
Both graying.

01:02:37.013 --> 01:02:38.944
One brilliant, one mad.

01:02:38.946 --> 01:02:40.679
Aye, but which is which?

01:03:08.046 --> 01:03:09.945
Where to from here?

01:03:12.279 --> 01:03:14.244
Antagonism to bathe.

01:03:14.246 --> 01:03:16.710
Batheable to cholera.

01:03:16.712 --> 01:03:18.010
Choleric to dysenteric.

01:03:18.012 --> 01:03:19.743
Dysentery to eczema.

01:03:19.745 --> 01:03:22.777
Eczematous to fungus.

01:03:22.779 --> 01:03:24.276
Why not jump straight to
leprosy?

01:03:24.278 --> 01:03:25.676
Oh, that's dropping off a lot.

01:03:25.678 --> 01:03:27.177
You could go back to acne.

01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:29.110
Well, there's no need to be
rash.

01:03:29.112 --> 01:03:32.077
- Who's this?
- Murray, sir.

01:03:32.079 --> 01:03:34.010
- Who's Murray?
- The man from the dictionary...

01:03:34.012 --> 01:03:36.044
the one the doctor has been
working on.

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:38.843
Good God, well, he's had a very
busy day.

01:03:38.845 --> 01:03:40.743
Let's keep it short, shall we?

01:03:40.745 --> 01:03:41.944
Yes, sir.

01:03:43.179 --> 01:03:47.743
Mr. Muncie? Accord Dr. Murray
full visitation privileges.

01:03:47.745 --> 01:03:49.676
Let me know when they're
gonna happen.

01:03:49.678 --> 01:03:53.143
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

01:03:53.145 --> 01:03:57.012
Let's document all their
meetings, keep full details.

01:03:58.146 --> 01:04:00.044
One could dare say it's
beautiful here.

01:04:00.046 --> 01:04:02.309
Listen to the leaves scratch
the air.

01:04:02.311 --> 01:04:07.642
Sometimes it sounds like
gunfire. Sometimes like...

01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:11.544
- Like applause.
- Yes, applause.

01:04:14.311 --> 01:04:15.876
Mr. Murray?

01:04:15.878 --> 01:04:19.809
- Aye. I should be off then.
- Check your posts.

01:04:19.811 --> 01:04:22.742
I will garner my thoughts and
spark them off of yours.

01:04:22.744 --> 01:04:23.977
As iron sharpens iron...

01:04:23.979 --> 01:04:26.843
so one man sharpens the
countenance of a friend.

01:04:26.845 --> 01:04:30.344
Scripture. You're a man of God,
I should not be surprised.

01:04:30.346 --> 01:04:33.310
It is by His grace alone.

01:04:33.312 --> 01:04:36.110
I wish I had experienced
that more often.

01:04:36.112 --> 01:04:37.309
You will, my friend.

01:04:37.311 --> 01:04:41.309
Goodness and mercy shall follow
me all the days of my life.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:44.909
Yeah, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death.

01:04:44.911 --> 01:04:47.177
You're not alone, good doctor.

01:04:47.179 --> 01:04:49.642
We are linked now...
consanguineous.

01:04:49.644 --> 01:04:51.243
Brothers.

01:05:03.611 --> 01:05:05.143
I looked for you this morning...

01:05:05.145 --> 01:05:07.209
I wanted to share some good news
with you.

01:05:07.211 --> 01:05:09.009
What news?

01:05:09.011 --> 01:05:13.143
A new volunteer, a miracle...
he's pulling us out of the mire.

01:05:13.145 --> 01:05:15.709
We've doubled our progress
with him already.

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:19.844
That's wonderful, James.
Who is he?

01:05:22.744 --> 01:05:24.675
A friend.

01:05:44.378 --> 01:05:47.043
A letter from our
superintendent, sir.

01:05:47.045 --> 01:05:48.110
Oh, thank you.

01:05:50.044 --> 01:05:52.841
Henry, could you keep an eye
for all future letters...

01:05:52.843 --> 01:05:54.009
from the good doctor?

01:05:54.011 --> 01:05:57.778
He is rather a private man and I
would wish to honor that.

01:06:05.843 --> 01:06:08.009
I brought another book for you.

01:06:08.011 --> 01:06:11.175
I see that. What is it?

01:06:11.177 --> 01:06:14.242
One from the list Mr. Muncie
gave me.

01:06:14.244 --> 01:06:16.177
I asked, it's one of the ones
you wanted.

01:06:17.777 --> 01:06:21.243
You read.

01:06:21.245 --> 01:06:26.275
I will guess which one it is,
a paragraph, a sentence.

01:06:26.277 --> 01:06:28.310
I'm sorry, doctor.

01:06:29.311 --> 01:06:31.641
Mrs. Merrett, Mrs. Merrett...

01:06:31.643 --> 01:06:34.743
Mrs. Merrett, please,
what did I do?

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:44.643
You cannot read.

01:06:46.111 --> 01:06:48.242
Forgive me, I should not have
presumed.

01:06:48.244 --> 01:06:51.075
I do not need you to bring me
books, Mrs. Merrett...

01:06:51.077 --> 01:06:52.208
it is your visits...

01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:53.775
Please, doctor, let me be.

01:06:53.777 --> 01:06:55.841
I can teach you.

01:06:55.843 --> 01:06:57.308
I am what I am.

01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:59.941
Oh, please, let me teach you.
You can teach your children.

01:06:59.943 --> 01:07:01.775
It's freedom, Mrs. Merrett.

01:07:01.777 --> 01:07:04.042
I can fly out of this place
on the backs of books.

01:07:04.044 --> 01:07:06.208
I've gone to the end of the
world on the wings of words.

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:07.741
I can not.

01:07:07.743 --> 01:07:10.877
When I read, no one is after me.

01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:18.843
When I read, I am the one who is
chasing, chasing after God.

01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:25.177
Please, I beg you... join the
chase.

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:29.242
Kumquat.

01:07:29.244 --> 01:07:31.075
Oblong.

01:07:31.077 --> 01:07:33.841
Pert.

01:07:33.843 --> 01:07:36.041
Prunes.

01:07:36.043 --> 01:07:39.375
Coconuts.

01:07:39.377 --> 01:07:42.642
Chitty.

01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:52.008
My win, Murray.

01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:54.042
- What on earth is chitty?
- Long form of chit.

01:07:54.044 --> 01:07:57.274
Of course, chit. Letter or note,
Indian origin, no?

01:07:57.276 --> 01:07:59.009
That's right.

01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:04.108
Who is she?

01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:06.308
The impossible.

01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.674
The more impossible, the greater
the love.

01:08:09.676 --> 01:08:11.910
Do you truly believe that?

01:08:15.076 --> 01:08:16.809
My heart is so sick.

01:08:19.977 --> 01:08:25.140
What I know of love, the
sickness often becomes the cure.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:32.042
She is my friend, she is my
dear friend...

01:08:32.044 --> 01:08:35.975
she has suffered a terrible
loss.

01:08:48.642 --> 01:08:52.243
Perhaps God's grace will come to
her through your love, William.

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:08.974
Eats, so you don't really say
the "A"?

01:09:08.975 --> 01:09:10.309
Eats.

01:09:12.376 --> 01:09:17.974
Wa... ush... brush and fish.

01:09:17.975 --> 01:09:19.673
- Yes.
- Wash.

01:09:19.675 --> 01:09:22.207
You're learning very, very fast.

01:09:22.209 --> 01:09:28.307
The brain is wider than the sky,
for put them side by side...

01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:34.774
the one the other will include,
with ease and you beside.

01:09:34.776 --> 01:09:40.307
The brain is just the weight
of God, for, heft them...

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:45.607
pound for pound, and they will
differ if they do...

01:09:45.609 --> 01:09:48.008
as syllable from the sound.

01:09:48.908 --> 01:09:51.639
Did they cut the rest of the
hair on that girl off?

01:10:03.309 --> 01:10:04.672
Mrs. Merrett?

01:10:04.674 --> 01:10:06.041
He's making the most tremendous
progress.

01:10:06.043 --> 01:10:07.373
Mrs. Merrett.

01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:09.673
I'm beginning to believe the
more he's exposed...

01:10:09.675 --> 01:10:13.607
to the world beyond these walls,
the speedier will be his cure.

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:15.739
You think he can be cured,
doctor?

01:10:15.741 --> 01:10:21.306
I have to... there must be hope
for all of us.

01:10:21.308 --> 01:10:25.173
Even the most broken of souls.

01:10:25.175 --> 01:10:29.209
I, uh... think on it.

01:10:34.308 --> 01:10:37.106
<i>My Dear Friend,
I have recommended...</i>

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:39.206
<i>to the Delegates that your name
be acknowledged...</i>

01:10:39.208 --> 01:10:41.739
<i>in the First Volume of the
"New English Dictionary...</i>

01:10:41.741 --> 01:10:45.240
<i>on Historical Principles", to
which your vibrant mind...</i>

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:47.973
<i>has so critically given the
breath of life.</i>

01:10:47.975 --> 01:10:51.374
<i>The last fascicle is already
complete.</i>

01:10:51.376 --> 01:10:54.242
<i>Expectantly, James.</i>

01:11:32.775 --> 01:11:36.306
Congratulations, Dr. Murray.

01:11:36.308 --> 01:11:38.705
For giving us A to byzen.

01:11:38.707 --> 01:11:42.006
And for the rest to come,
beginning with cab.

01:11:42.008 --> 01:11:43.672
Thank you, sir.

01:11:58.608 --> 01:12:00.173
It's not selling.

01:12:00.175 --> 01:12:03.605
4,000 orders the Empire through
and he won't go any quicker.

01:12:03.607 --> 01:12:05.873
We're the laughing stock
of all academia.

01:12:05.875 --> 01:12:09.838
I wonder if it's time to ease
our gentle Scotsman...

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.640
off his little perch.

01:12:37.107 --> 01:12:38.273
Stop it!

01:12:38.275 --> 01:12:40.738
It'll be alright, they're good
kids.

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.774
We don't have to do it,
if you don't want to.

01:12:44.775 --> 01:12:48.174
Look at me... William.

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:52.705
It'll be alright.

01:12:52.707 --> 01:12:55.772
Children, I would like you
to meet a friend...

01:12:55.774 --> 01:12:58.041
his name is William.

01:13:00.274 --> 01:13:03.372
You must be Olive, is that
right?

01:13:03.374 --> 01:13:04.807
Yes.

01:13:07.374 --> 01:13:08.906
- Iris.
- Mm-hm.

01:13:10.207 --> 01:13:14.774
Jack, and Peggy.

01:13:17.107 --> 01:13:21.607
You must be Peter, it's good
to meet you, Peter.

01:13:26.307 --> 01:13:28.141
And are you Clare, then?

01:13:32.006 --> 01:13:33.607
Clare.

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.840
Truly I'm honored to meet you,
Clare.

01:13:48.307 --> 01:13:49.974
Clare!

01:13:51.107 --> 01:13:52.271
Clare!

01:14:13.174 --> 01:14:18.204
Mr. Muncie. Watch them for me,
just for a moment.

01:14:18.206 --> 01:14:19.939
Mm-hm.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.304
Doctor! Wait! Wait! I'm sorry.

01:14:27.306 --> 01:14:30.572
I never wanted that to happen.
I'm so sorry.

01:14:36.006 --> 01:14:39.271
I remember being safe and still
I remember knowing who I was...

01:14:39.273 --> 01:14:43.670
and I woke up and it had all
gone away, and I hated you...

01:14:43.672 --> 01:14:48.204
so much, for so long, but now
I know you, I know who you are.

01:14:48.206 --> 01:14:50.806
And I know the same has been
done to you.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.873
I wrote you something.

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:12.171
"I can"...

01:15:12.173 --> 01:15:15.706
"I can... because of you."

01:15:20.973 --> 01:15:23.739
I miss my husband.

01:15:25.339 --> 01:15:29.304
I came here that first day
to hate you.

01:15:29.306 --> 01:15:33.173
To take your money, watch you
locked away, see you done.

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:38.370
You should still hate me.

01:15:38.372 --> 01:15:42.005
Not any more.

01:16:33.105 --> 01:16:37.905
Look what you've done!
Look what you've done!

01:17:02.239 --> 01:17:05.072
Not that many this time, sir.

01:18:21.804 --> 01:18:27.937
I wrote you something.
No, read it when I've gone.

01:18:34.637 --> 01:18:38.905
I'm sorry, Eliza.

01:18:39.838 --> 01:18:43.604
But what if I'm not?

01:19:38.137 --> 01:19:40.236
I have killed him again.

01:19:40.238 --> 01:19:43.369
It's all your fault.

01:19:43.371 --> 01:19:48.004
I've killed him again
in your heart!

01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:55.170
Mr. Coleman!

01:20:57.936 --> 01:20:59.970
You might alert the clinic.

01:21:03.203 --> 01:21:05.170
I have injured myself.

01:21:25.869 --> 01:21:30.201
<i>"My Friend, I no
longer find I have the place...</i>

01:21:30.203 --> 01:21:33.834
<i>for this, I thought you might
accept it.</i>

01:21:33.836 --> 01:21:36.933
<i>Remember me by it.</i>

01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:39.900
<i>As a testament to our
friendship and to that...</i>

01:21:39.902 --> 01:21:44.768
<i>which we created together, in
the brief and fleeting time...</i>

01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:50.102
<i>when thanks to you, I could
trust my mind... William.</i>

01:21:53.668 --> 01:21:56.666
Dr. Murray, Richard Brayn,
Superintendent.

01:21:56.668 --> 01:21:58.934
Pleased to meet you, sir.

01:21:58.936 --> 01:22:01.900
I am very proud of the
contributions that Dr. Minor...

01:22:01.902 --> 01:22:03.100
has made, of course.

01:22:03.102 --> 01:22:06.067
The illness has entered a new
phase. You may be shocked.

01:22:06.069 --> 01:22:09.702
I should warn you, too, that he
may display some hostility.

01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:22.800
You came.

01:22:22.802 --> 01:22:25.200
Of course, I came.

01:22:25.202 --> 01:22:27.668
I knew that you would.

01:22:32.102 --> 01:22:36.768
Your God is very demanding.

01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:39.935
A sacrifice was required.

01:22:44.336 --> 01:22:46.034
I received your letter.

01:22:46.036 --> 01:22:52.600
His love... his wife...

01:22:52.602 --> 01:22:57.835
I stole her from the dead.

01:23:01.302 --> 01:23:06.967
Have you gotten to the "I's"
by now?

01:23:06.969 --> 01:23:12.167
I had some to add to your words.

01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:16.100
But I can't seem to...

01:23:16.102 --> 01:23:20.100
I can't seem to find my pens.

01:23:20.102 --> 01:23:22.633
Our words, William, our words.

01:23:22.635 --> 01:23:25.901
Perhaps that is true, perhaps...

01:23:28.601 --> 01:23:33.902
madness... gave us words.

01:23:37.336 --> 01:23:42.301
But you have made them yours,
they bear your secret signature.

01:23:46.035 --> 01:23:50.732
Why did you come here?

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:52.632
Did you bring others?

01:23:52.634 --> 01:23:53.933
I am alone, William.

01:23:53.935 --> 01:23:59.299
I have reason to believe that
they are hiding...

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:04.302
between the spaces in the floor,
biding their time.

01:24:07.268 --> 01:24:10.835
I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry.

01:24:13.168 --> 01:24:16.033
For a moment, I...

01:24:16.035 --> 01:24:20.935
dared to hope.

01:24:22.268 --> 01:24:26.099
Your words, her... forgiveness.

01:24:26.101 --> 01:24:29.932
It's more than forgiveness.

01:24:29.934 --> 01:24:33.968
She... she gave me this.

01:24:35.001 --> 01:24:38.699
Read it later, if you truly want
to know why.

01:24:38.701 --> 01:24:41.199
Know what?

01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:44.266
Assythment.

01:24:44.268 --> 01:24:46.099
Assythment.

01:24:46.101 --> 01:24:51.599
Assythment.

01:24:51.601 --> 01:24:57.299
A quote, Austin, 1832.

01:24:57.301 --> 01:25:03.199
I sent it in, but only hoping,
I wasn't sure, until now.

01:25:03.201 --> 01:25:05.099
I can't... I can't remember
the quote.

01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:08.901
Look it up! Look it up!

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:16.899
You have seen me now
and we're done.

01:25:16.901 --> 01:25:21.299
You can leave the lunatic
to his delusions.

01:25:21.301 --> 01:25:23.699
I came here to see my friend.

01:25:23.701 --> 01:25:28.664
I am no man's friend,
I am a murderer.

01:25:28.666 --> 01:25:31.298
Everything else is make believe.

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:35.798
So leave, leave, leave, leave,
leave, leave, leave...

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.033
leave, leave, leave, leave,
leave, leave!

01:25:39.035 --> 01:25:45.632
And do not come back! I do not
want to see you!

01:25:45.634 --> 01:25:49.965
Please, doctor, if your claim
that you are my friend...

01:25:49.967 --> 01:25:55.832
is true, you will respect
that one simple wish!

01:25:55.834 --> 01:25:58.234
Yeah.

01:26:02.134 --> 01:26:04.867
I think no more visitors
for Dr. Minor.

01:26:09.134 --> 01:26:13.965
Bondmade, missing from Volume
One.

01:26:13.967 --> 01:26:16.166
A perfectly solid, everyday
English word...

01:26:16.168 --> 01:26:17.166
and we don't have it.

01:26:17.168 --> 01:26:18.033
I don't know how that could
have happened...

01:26:18.035 --> 01:26:19.932
I checked the proofs for it
myself.

01:26:19.934 --> 01:26:21.598
The University of Vienna picked
up on it.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.065
The bloody Austrians, it's a
disgrace.

01:26:23.067 --> 01:26:24.698
Calm down, Philip.

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:27.664
We'll catch it, we'll form
an addendum.

01:26:27.666 --> 01:26:28.931
I've been meaning to discuss
that with all of you.

01:26:28.933 --> 01:26:31.198
Are you intending to drop
others?

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.998
The makers of this grand folly
also deign it beneath them...

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.998
to include the nouns and
adjectives denoting countries.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.165
Hence no mention of African,
Arabian, American and so on.

01:26:43.167 --> 01:26:44.965
In the blasted Figaro!

01:26:44.967 --> 01:26:47.298
In the same breath, expounding
the virtues...

01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:48.798
of their competing dictionaries.

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:51.631
In France, Germany, the
Netherlands.

01:26:51.633 --> 01:26:53.798
This is a war about the spread
of colonial language...

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.765
not one with bullets and
bayonets...

01:26:55.767 --> 01:26:57.298
but with influence and
appearance.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:58.499
This is utterly absurd.

01:26:58.501 --> 01:27:02.798
No, what is absurd is your
dogged, bullheaded approach...

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.898
a superabundance of redundancy,
Dr. Murray.

01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:06.931
We need your focus.

01:27:06.933 --> 01:27:08.997
The language is escaping you,
you are losing.

01:27:08.999 --> 01:27:12.165
What precisely are you saying,
Mr. Gell?

01:27:12.167 --> 01:27:15.598
This is Oxford. We do not lose.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.164
Clearly the only course
remaining...

01:27:17.166 --> 01:27:18.264
Bondmade.

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:19.432
What was that? Speak up,
Freddie.

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:25.065
Bondmade. I borrowed the proof
from the scriptorium...

01:27:25.067 --> 01:27:26.298
to use in one of my lectures.

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.998
I forgot to replace it. I am
responsible for its exclusion.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.097
It doesn't change a thing.

01:27:31.099 --> 01:27:34.964
Also the absence of African,
Arabian, and American.

01:27:34.966 --> 01:27:36.864
I convinced James not to include
them.

01:27:36.866 --> 01:27:40.765
So you see, gentlemen, you are
inculpating the wrong man.

01:27:40.767 --> 01:27:45.264
You're right, Philip, there is
only one course of action.

01:27:45.266 --> 01:27:48.332
I will resign my post from
the board of delegates.

01:27:48.334 --> 01:27:51.065
We shall make an announcement
on it.

01:27:51.067 --> 01:27:54.164
And the project will go on,
with James.

01:27:54.166 --> 01:27:55.765
I really don't see how...

01:27:55.767 --> 01:27:56.897
Philip, please!

01:27:56.899 --> 01:27:59.766
Have it in writing to the Press
offices in the morning.

01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:02.830
He's lying through his teeth.

01:28:02.832 --> 01:28:03.965
Of course he is.

01:28:03.967 --> 01:28:05.164
Then why let them get away
with it?

01:28:05.166 --> 01:28:08.997
Didn't you see? Dr. Murray is a
breath away from shattering.

01:28:08.999 --> 01:28:11.031
And without Furnivall's
meddling...

01:28:11.033 --> 01:28:12.164
all we need do is wait.

01:28:12.166 --> 01:28:15.364
Have a quiet word with Bradley,
I suspect he is just...

01:28:15.366 --> 01:28:19.698
the ticket for a more malleable
pair of hands at the helm.

01:28:35.066 --> 01:28:38.064
James... what's the matter?

01:28:38.066 --> 01:28:43.766
I'm adrift, Ada. The day has
been one of loss.

01:28:46.665 --> 01:28:48.797
I need to tell you some things.

01:28:48.799 --> 01:28:51.364
Don't go on... what you've
done...

01:28:51.366 --> 01:28:53.797
there is nothing you can tell me
to make this right!

01:28:53.799 --> 01:28:55.964
All the wisdom, all the
diligence and you simply...

01:28:55.966 --> 01:28:58.097
How long have you known about
his madness?

01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:00.164
How much time have you spent
with this man?

01:29:00.166 --> 01:29:02.964
Why are you so angry? What
difference can it possibly make?

01:29:02.966 --> 01:29:05.797
His work on the dictionary
proves he is sane.

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:08.097
He fooled that jury and he
fooled you.

01:29:08.099 --> 01:29:10.264
What about repentance, Ada?
What about redemption?

01:29:10.266 --> 01:29:12.730
The delegates, your team,
your family...

01:29:12.732 --> 01:29:14.330
we all deserve more than
to have it all...

01:29:14.332 --> 01:29:16.265
Stop!

01:29:18.699 --> 01:29:20.297
I could call into question
the morality...

01:29:20.299 --> 01:29:23.729
of every invisible volunteer
we've ever leaned on.

01:29:23.731 --> 01:29:25.764
This one hits his children,
that one's on the whiskey...

01:29:25.766 --> 01:29:28.797
this one, didn't you hear, he
cheats on the Times crossword.

01:29:28.799 --> 01:29:30.130
Remove the blaggard
from the list.

01:29:30.132 --> 01:29:32.364
He is a murderer! He lied
to you.

01:29:32.366 --> 01:29:36.631
Have you never lied?
Have you not?

01:29:40.632 --> 01:29:44.996
What are you so afraid of, that
a bad man can be redeemed?

01:29:44.998 --> 01:29:47.696
Isn't that what we believe, what
we whisper to our children...

01:29:47.698 --> 01:29:50.330
at night, what we pray for?
Forgiveness.

01:29:50.332 --> 01:29:53.130
I don't know who you're
preaching to.

01:29:53.132 --> 01:29:54.265
Neither do I.

01:29:56.931 --> 01:30:00.363
"Thus they in lowliest plight
repentant stood praying...

01:30:00.365 --> 01:30:03.964
from the mercy seat above,
prevenient grace descending...

01:30:03.966 --> 01:30:06.996
had removed the stony from their
hearts and made new flesh".

01:30:06.998 --> 01:30:10.662
Milton, Paradise Lost,
prevenient grace, Ada.

01:30:10.664 --> 01:30:13.030
From before the fall,
salvation for all...

01:30:13.032 --> 01:30:14.831
if we choose to engage it.

01:30:21.798 --> 01:30:24.696
"If love... then what?"

01:30:24.698 --> 01:30:25.929
What is that?

01:30:25.931 --> 01:30:31.065
A note, from the widow, asking
the question of the killer.

01:30:49.297 --> 01:30:52.796
"Assythment - satisfaction
for an injury done.

01:30:52.798 --> 01:30:56.130
Compensation, reparation,
indemnification.

01:30:56.132 --> 01:30:58.629
By law, the wife and family
of the slain...

01:30:58.631 --> 01:31:00.896
have still the right
for assythment."

01:31:00.898 --> 01:31:02.195
I don't understand.

01:31:02.197 --> 01:31:04.330
It means to pay everything back.

01:31:04.332 --> 01:31:06.629
The guilty make recompense
the victim.

01:31:06.631 --> 01:31:08.263
I thought he'd already given
her money.

01:31:08.265 --> 01:31:12.596
No, Ada, his life, with his
life.

01:31:12.598 --> 01:31:15.896
"If love... then what?"

01:31:15.898 --> 01:31:20.762
Is what she wrote to him.
And his response.

01:31:20.764 --> 01:31:24.132
"...then no chance redemption."

01:31:26.831 --> 01:31:29.596
What are you going to do?

01:31:29.598 --> 01:31:31.930
What can I do?

01:31:36.597 --> 01:31:39.262
Sometimes when we push away...

01:31:39.264 --> 01:31:44.265
that is when we most need
to be resisted.

01:31:59.065 --> 01:32:02.062
Please, let me in, let me in!

01:32:02.064 --> 01:32:04.662
I need to see him, let me in!

01:32:04.664 --> 01:32:07.095
Mr. Muncie, please, I know you
can hear me, let me in!

01:32:07.097 --> 01:32:08.595
I need to see him!

01:32:21.597 --> 01:32:22.830
Let me in!

01:32:24.897 --> 01:32:27.129
- Mrs. Merrett...
- I need to see him, please.

01:32:27.131 --> 01:32:30.661
It is best you went away now
and you not come back.

01:32:30.663 --> 01:32:31.661
Please, I need to see him.

01:32:31.663 --> 01:32:33.229
Mrs. Merrett, I'm sorry.

01:32:33.231 --> 01:32:36.095
Oh, I need to see him, please!
No!

01:32:36.097 --> 01:32:41.595
I need to see him! Please!

01:33:14.263 --> 01:33:16.329
<i>It is time to
commence a course...</i>

01:33:16.331 --> 01:33:19.262
<i>of more invasive and more
experimental treatments...</i>

01:33:19.264 --> 01:33:22.195
<i>all procedures will be fully
documented.</i>

01:33:22.197 --> 01:33:28.063
William... are we ready?

01:33:30.131 --> 01:33:32.562
Most rightfully so.

01:33:35.662 --> 01:33:37.830
Thank you, doctor.

01:33:39.330 --> 01:33:43.129
Secure his arms, all right,
here we go.

01:33:43.131 --> 01:33:47.562
That's it. Steady. Good boy.

01:33:50.797 --> 01:33:56.362
Come on, let's get him over.
Up you go. All right.

01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:58.729
- Doctor, please bear with me.
- Yes.

01:34:04.363 --> 01:34:10.097
All right, that's it, that's it.
Steady.

01:34:12.064 --> 01:34:13.161
Again.

01:34:13.163 --> 01:34:15.294
- Same again, sir.
- Oh, no.

01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:26.596
Again.

01:34:29.596 --> 01:34:30.929
Oh, yeah, we've got you.

01:34:32.863 --> 01:34:34.030
Again.

01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:38.963
- One more, sir, good boy.
- I asked first.

01:34:44.662 --> 01:34:49.529
Up now, up now. Steady.

01:34:51.828 --> 01:34:53.096
Once more.

01:34:58.996 --> 01:35:01.230
- You've got them?
- Yes.

01:35:12.262 --> 01:35:14.660
Mrs. Murray.

01:35:14.662 --> 01:35:18.593
My name is Church, I'm with the
South London Chronicle.

01:35:18.595 --> 01:35:20.861
May I speak with your husband,
ma'am?

01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:28.659
The story runs
tomorrow, sir, everything...

01:35:28.661 --> 01:35:31.161
you, the big book, the widow
Merrett.

01:35:31.163 --> 01:35:34.094
There's nothing I can do
about it now.

01:35:34.096 --> 01:35:36.962
I just wanted to give you
fair warning.

01:35:42.263 --> 01:35:46.561
But these... I haven't given'em
to the paper.

01:35:48.195 --> 01:35:51.129
I thought, maybe, you should
hold on to them.

01:35:53.230 --> 01:35:55.895
It looks like he's in a bad way,
sir.

01:36:04.762 --> 01:36:06.193
Mother!

01:36:06.195 --> 01:36:08.928
No, no... go upstairs and play up
there.

01:36:28.728 --> 01:36:29.928
James.

01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:44.960
If I may say, sir, between you
and me, I've been concerned...

01:36:44.962 --> 01:36:48.062
about some of Dr. Brayn's
medical techniques.

01:36:51.962 --> 01:36:54.926
We had to take precautions.

01:36:54.928 --> 01:37:01.227
William? It's James, William.

01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:02.792
William.

01:37:02.794 --> 01:37:06.060
It's no use, I'm afraid.
He's not here.

01:37:06.062 --> 01:37:09.326
I don't know where he is,
but he's not here.

01:37:15.295 --> 01:37:16.893
Wait for me outside.

01:37:16.895 --> 01:37:18.760
Dr. Murray, I must ask that you
inform me...

01:37:18.762 --> 01:37:20.693
before you pay a visit.

01:37:20.695 --> 01:37:22.226
I came as soon as I knew.

01:37:22.228 --> 01:37:25.626
Yes, but it's not a club, sir,
this is a medical facility.

01:37:25.628 --> 01:37:27.327
Dr. Minor is a patient
in my care.

01:37:27.329 --> 01:37:28.625
He is my friend, my brother.

01:37:28.627 --> 01:37:29.658
Yes, he's my friend, as well.

01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:32.093
And he's one of the bravest men
I have ever known.

01:37:32.095 --> 01:37:35.760
However, this is severe
catalepsy.

01:37:35.762 --> 01:37:36.892
It's a fair question...

01:37:36.894 --> 01:37:40.129
whether or not the soul has
already left the vessel.

01:37:41.794 --> 01:37:44.692
"Divided from himself and his
fair judgment...

01:37:44.694 --> 01:37:50.593
without which we are pictures
or mere beasts."

01:37:50.595 --> 01:37:53.028
How could this have happened?

01:37:55.062 --> 01:37:57.060
I must ask you to leave
immediately.

01:37:57.062 --> 01:37:58.860
No, he doesn't belong here,
not like this.

01:37:58.862 --> 01:38:00.359
On the contrary, he does not
belong anywhere else.

01:38:00.361 --> 01:38:01.959
Please allow us to get on
with our work.

01:38:01.961 --> 01:38:05.658
We have a great deal to do.
It's alright, William.

01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:08.926
Please! It's alright, William...

01:38:08.928 --> 01:38:14.961
it's alright, William,
it's all right.

01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:20.861
The last 400 years have been
defined by his quotes alone.

01:38:22.927 --> 01:38:26.259
We were at our darkest moment.
He gave us life.

01:38:26.261 --> 01:38:29.892
I'm asking for your help here,
Ben.

01:38:29.894 --> 01:38:32.226
To tell the truth of what
he's done.

01:38:32.228 --> 01:38:34.192
Let it be known, not this.

01:38:34.194 --> 01:38:37.625
My only regret is that you did
not come forward...

01:38:37.627 --> 01:38:38.859
with this much sooner.

01:38:38.861 --> 01:38:42.759
What there is to be known has
already been said... right here.

01:38:42.761 --> 01:38:44.026
Written. Didn't you see?

01:38:44.028 --> 01:38:45.859
But this is the life of a man.

01:38:45.861 --> 01:38:47.959
All that he is will end with him
in that place.

01:38:47.961 --> 01:38:50.892
And he is where he should be.

01:38:50.894 --> 01:38:52.859
What use an act
of pointless charity?

01:38:52.861 --> 01:38:54.291
Then I resign.

01:38:54.293 --> 01:38:57.191
There will be no need for such
theatrics.

01:38:57.193 --> 01:39:00.092
William Minor will be struck
from all acknowledgments.

01:39:00.094 --> 01:39:03.092
You are to be welcomed, for as
long as you like...

01:39:03.094 --> 01:39:05.325
as a contributor to the
dictionary.

01:39:05.327 --> 01:39:07.925
The editorship will pass
immediately to Bradley.

01:39:07.927 --> 01:39:10.725
I will be proposing this at
an emergency meeting...

01:39:10.727 --> 01:39:12.292
of the delegates this afternoon.

01:39:12.294 --> 01:39:15.359
I do not expect any dissent.

01:39:15.361 --> 01:39:17.226
I won't thieve any more
of your time.

01:39:17.228 --> 01:39:19.061
Nor I yours.

01:39:35.793 --> 01:39:36.991
Yes, sir?

01:39:36.993 --> 01:39:40.626
Is the master of the house in?

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:52.724
James... is everything alright?

01:39:52.726 --> 01:39:58.358
I'm sorry, Freddie, I didn't
know where else to go.

01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:03.093
I've lost everything.
Everything is broken.

01:40:07.826 --> 01:40:13.624
I wanted to document the history
of each and every thing.

01:40:13.626 --> 01:40:17.025
To offer the world a book that
gives the meaning...

01:40:17.027 --> 01:40:19.824
of everything in God's creation.

01:40:19.826 --> 01:40:26.027
Or at least the English part of
it, but it has defeated me.

01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:30.758
And now I've paid for it
with everything...

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.724
that ever meant anything to me.

01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:36.791
You know, there is another book
that purports to do just that.

01:40:36.793 --> 01:40:39.893
But it has already beaten you
to the punch.

01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:46.559
Come with me. Come, I want to
show you something.

01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:49.158
I need me dunnage.

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:52.193
What, with a sprat?
How'd you do that?

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:56.624
Dunnage? Sprat? Blag?

01:40:56.626 --> 01:40:58.191
How many new words to replace
the old?

01:40:58.193 --> 01:41:02.791
How many new words for things
that have yet to be imagined?

01:41:02.793 --> 01:41:06.058
How many of them in your all
encompassing book?

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:09.325
No language can ever be
permanently the same, James.

01:41:09.327 --> 01:41:11.991
Not if it springs forth
from life.

01:41:11.993 --> 01:41:15.824
But how can the work be ended
if not ever completed?

01:41:15.826 --> 01:41:20.257
You have given us its heart
along with a great jolt...

01:41:20.259 --> 01:41:21.325
to begin the first few beats.

01:41:21.327 --> 01:41:24.957
Generations after you will
continue this work...

01:41:24.959 --> 01:41:28.924
because you have showed them
the way.

01:41:28.926 --> 01:41:31.290
But it will never be completed.

01:41:31.292 --> 01:41:32.724
Let it go.

01:41:32.726 --> 01:41:36.057
Tend to yourself, leave the
project to me.

01:41:36.059 --> 01:41:39.025
I have a few tricks for Jowett
and his lackey Gell...

01:41:39.027 --> 01:41:41.692
that they have not considered
in their maneuvering.

01:41:45.226 --> 01:41:46.992
Ada?

01:41:48.026 --> 01:41:51.857
With Bradley in charge and the
University press...

01:41:51.859 --> 01:41:54.723
firmly driving the endeavour,
we believe we can keep...

01:41:54.725 --> 01:41:57.923
to our desired target of 704
pages a year...

01:41:57.925 --> 01:41:59.357
doubling current sales
estimates.

01:41:59.359 --> 01:42:01.024
Thank you, Mr. Gell.

01:42:01.026 --> 01:42:03.723
Well, gentlemen, I believe we
are all now...

01:42:03.725 --> 01:42:07.723
sufficiently informed to put
the motion to a vote.

01:42:23.259 --> 01:42:26.790
I'm sorry my husband is unable
to attend.

01:42:26.792 --> 01:42:29.990
I would like to ask permission
to say a few words in his stead.

01:42:29.992 --> 01:42:31.590
Mrs. Murray, this is a closed
meeting.

01:42:31.592 --> 01:42:32.857
I'm afraid you will have
to leave.

01:42:32.859 --> 01:42:36.224
My family and I have given much
for the glory of the delegates..

01:42:36.226 --> 01:42:39.823
Mr. Gell, I am certain they can
give a few moments...

01:42:39.825 --> 01:42:41.623
of their time in return.

01:42:41.625 --> 01:42:43.856
Of course, Mrs. Murray.

01:42:43.858 --> 01:42:46.059
We are here to listen,
please, go ahead.

01:42:50.859 --> 01:42:54.723
My husband has this silly,
little leather parchment.

01:42:54.725 --> 01:43:00.892
On it, he's engraved a creed.
"Only a most diligent life."

01:43:03.592 --> 01:43:07.023
Diligence. I looked it up,
in your dictionary.

01:43:07.025 --> 01:43:10.057
Constant and earnest effort to
accomplish what is undertaken.

01:43:10.059 --> 01:43:15.959
Persistence, application,
but also, toil, and pain.

01:43:17.191 --> 01:43:18.889
Some of you think my husband
a fool.

01:43:18.891 --> 01:43:21.590
Obstinate. Naive.

01:43:21.592 --> 01:43:23.057
Driven to what he is by fear...

01:43:23.059 --> 01:43:30.823
of what awaits us all on the
other side, but he isn't.

01:43:30.825 --> 01:43:33.889
He sees the world, all of it,
with its myriad choices...

01:43:33.891 --> 01:43:36.758
and he chooses to be what he is.

01:43:41.325 --> 01:43:46.989
Yet, two such men found each
other in our time.

01:43:46.991 --> 01:43:52.156
My husband and his friend, the
murderous madman.

01:43:52.158 --> 01:43:58.758
Together they have given us
something extraordinary.

01:44:00.591 --> 01:44:03.323
I am here to ask you to take
exception...

01:44:03.325 --> 01:44:05.591
to our prevailing natures.

01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:12.025
I'm here to ask you not to
punish them for it.

01:44:16.624 --> 01:44:19.822
Bradley told me you quit.

01:44:19.824 --> 01:44:22.256
I did what I could in there,
but they're a tough lot.

01:44:22.258 --> 01:44:25.223
We're leaving this place.
We're going back to London.

01:44:25.225 --> 01:44:27.789
The book, it is not just
yours to quit.

01:44:27.791 --> 01:44:32.721
It is ours, remember? Mine, the
children's, countless others'.

01:44:32.723 --> 01:44:36.591
And they can, James, if there
is love.

01:44:38.958 --> 01:44:42.256
I know the answer now.

01:44:42.258 --> 01:44:45.958
I know the answer to the widow's
question.

01:44:50.691 --> 01:44:52.722
I want you to do something
for me.

01:44:52.724 --> 01:44:53.955
I will.

01:44:53.957 --> 01:45:00.056
I want you to go to her and look
her in the eyes.

01:45:00.058 --> 01:45:04.222
And if you see forgiveness,
if you see love...

01:45:04.224 --> 01:45:07.655
I want you to help your friend.

01:45:07.657 --> 01:45:09.823
Yeah.

01:45:19.358 --> 01:45:21.556
- Here, my man.
- Thank you, sir.

01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:33.356
He gave me that the last time
I saw him.

01:45:33.358 --> 01:45:35.123
The last time he was lucid.

01:45:35.125 --> 01:45:40.122
They won't let me see him.
Can you make them let me in?

01:45:40.124 --> 01:45:44.857
It's no use. He's not the same
as you remember.

01:45:49.125 --> 01:45:53.923
If I've forgiven him, why should
they go on punishing him?

01:45:55.224 --> 01:45:56.621
Thank you for seeing me...

01:45:56.623 --> 01:45:57.955
at such short notice, Sir
Charles.

01:45:57.957 --> 01:45:59.223
Freddie is an old friend.

01:45:59.225 --> 01:46:01.788
I have to warn you though,
Mr. Murray...

01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:03.188
the American murderer
is a scar...

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:04.988
perhaps one that is still
too fresh.

01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:06.255
Perhaps this will heal it.

01:46:06.257 --> 01:46:07.322
Hardly so.

01:46:07.324 --> 01:46:10.621
Any politician espousing his
cause is certain...

01:46:10.623 --> 01:46:13.788
to face public outrage, chances
of a pardon...

01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:16.155
or a reprieve, are virtually
non-existent.

01:46:16.157 --> 01:46:19.122
What price justice? What price
mercy?

01:46:19.124 --> 01:46:23.222
Expensive to your first, cheap
but unpopular to your second.

01:46:23.224 --> 01:46:28.588
Look here, levers can be pulled,
get you a hearing.

01:46:28.590 --> 01:46:31.288
But if I were you, I would do
all I can to find out...

01:46:31.290 --> 01:46:35.588
who will be called to it,
and I would stack the deck.

01:46:58.890 --> 01:47:03.623
William? William, can you hear
me?

01:47:03.989 --> 01:47:05.322
- Everybody out.
- It's James.

01:47:05.324 --> 01:47:06.854
Everybody out.

01:47:06.856 --> 01:47:09.687
William, you need to hear us.
Can you hear me?

01:47:09.689 --> 01:47:10.921
I brought Mrs. Merrett to see
you.

01:47:10.923 --> 01:47:12.221
Leave him be!

01:47:12.223 --> 01:47:14.688
- She needs to talk, you need to...
- Leave him be!

01:47:14.690 --> 01:47:19.689
With all due respect, sir,
leave <i>them</i> be!

01:47:20.957 --> 01:47:25.555
William? William?

01:47:26.757 --> 01:47:31.720
William, I'm here.

01:47:31.722 --> 01:47:34.587
It's Eliza.

01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:39.223
Do you remember, William?
"If love... then what?"

01:47:41.989 --> 01:47:44.756
If love... then what, William?

01:47:49.589 --> 01:47:56.522
If love... then love.

01:48:00.957 --> 01:48:03.156
If love, then love.

01:48:16.856 --> 01:48:18.256
Please stand.

01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:22.887
Do you know why you are here,
Dr. Minor?

01:48:22.889 --> 01:48:24.120
I do.

01:48:24.122 --> 01:48:28.987
And in your opinion, Sergeant,
have the circumstances changed?

01:48:28.989 --> 01:48:30.954
No, sir.

01:48:30.956 --> 01:48:33.720
Under what conditions did he
enter catalepsy?

01:48:33.722 --> 01:48:35.186
Documented procedures of
treatment.

01:48:35.188 --> 01:48:36.354
With the patient's agreement?

01:48:36.356 --> 01:48:40.054
Of course. Gentlemen, with
respect, the matter here...

01:48:40.056 --> 01:48:41.187
begs a different question.

01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:44.954
Where and into which hands would
misguided compassion...

01:48:44.956 --> 01:48:49.256
release him, there is nowhere
else. This is his home.

01:48:53.922 --> 01:48:54.987
Thank you, Mrs. Merrett.

01:48:54.989 --> 01:48:58.021
Is there anything further you
would like to say?

01:48:58.023 --> 01:48:59.954
Yes, I would.

01:48:59.956 --> 01:49:04.719
My husband didn't deserve what
happened to him.

01:49:04.721 --> 01:49:08.820
He worked hard. Kept his family
together.

01:49:08.822 --> 01:49:12.986
Then one day he was gone, and
nothing could bring him back.

01:49:12.988 --> 01:49:15.254
What happened to him isn't fair.

01:49:20.956 --> 01:49:23.320
For a long time after he was
gone...

01:49:23.322 --> 01:49:28.622
I didn't want to remember him,
not even what he looked like.

01:49:30.621 --> 01:49:34.220
I want to say I'm sorry
about that.

01:49:34.222 --> 01:49:36.521
He deserved more than that.

01:49:41.188 --> 01:49:44.254
My husband was a sweet man, but
he could get angry, too.

01:49:44.256 --> 01:49:47.719
Once he got so cross, he kicked
the heater...

01:49:47.721 --> 01:49:50.853
'cause it weren't working,
he put his foot right through...

01:49:50.855 --> 01:49:54.953
burnt it on the hot coals, he
was limping for weeks after.

01:49:54.955 --> 01:49:57.353
One day he caught Jack behind
him, hopping along...

01:49:57.355 --> 01:50:02.653
all hobbled and all, like him,
do you remember?

01:50:02.655 --> 01:50:09.621
He looked at Jack, and he
started to laugh.

01:50:10.688 --> 01:50:13.986
He laughed so hard hobbling,
he nearly fell over.

01:50:13.988 --> 01:50:17.853
I think that's why he was often
so cross.

01:50:17.855 --> 01:50:22.220
It's cause he wanted his babies,
you were all his babies...

01:50:22.222 --> 01:50:25.755
he wanted them to make him
laugh.

01:50:30.022 --> 01:50:34.320
I think if George was here now,
he'd think all this is unfair.

01:50:34.322 --> 01:50:39.086
I think this would make him
angry.

01:50:39.088 --> 01:50:42.053
He wouldn't have a lot of fancy
words to say about it.

01:50:42.055 --> 01:50:46.588
But I know he would want it
to stop.

01:50:52.787 --> 01:50:55.352
Sir, please, a moment of your
time.

01:50:55.354 --> 01:50:58.020
I will deliver my report in two
days. You will know then.

01:50:58.022 --> 01:51:00.219
We are not asking for your
full deliberation.

01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:02.619
Just a hint at which way you
lean.

01:51:02.621 --> 01:51:03.918
Release will be denied.

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.618
The particulars of his
treatment...

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.819
that have come to light are
troubling...

01:51:07.821 --> 01:51:09.053
Is that not enough to...

01:51:09.055 --> 01:51:12.252
But they are an indictment of
the entire criminally insane...

01:51:12.254 --> 01:51:15.253
system of which this board is
not a competent judge.

01:51:15.255 --> 01:51:17.320
Dr. Minor is a severely
disturbed man.

01:51:17.322 --> 01:51:19.153
For his own safety, the
recommendation...

01:51:19.155 --> 01:51:21.853
cannot be given to release him
into the open.

01:51:21.855 --> 01:51:23.786
Sir, is there no other way?

01:51:23.788 --> 01:51:26.586
Whatever you intend to do,
Dr. Murray, you have one day.

01:51:26.588 --> 01:51:29.687
Then I have to submit my report.

01:51:31.754 --> 01:51:34.219
We can try one last measure,
James.

01:51:34.221 --> 01:51:38.121
But you had better be prepared
to lay it all on.

01:51:38.588 --> 01:51:39.818
Your timing couldn't be worse.

01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:41.785
An armed gang of Latvians have
holed up...

01:51:41.787 --> 01:51:43.053
in a building on Sidney Street.

01:51:43.055 --> 01:51:44.818
The Scots Guards have it
surrounded...

01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:46.185
and the whole thing has
escalated into a siege.

01:51:46.187 --> 01:51:49.887
A bloody disaster, and it's put
him in a foul mood.

01:51:55.222 --> 01:51:56.920
Wait here.

01:52:15.121 --> 01:52:19.154
I'm sorry, chaps, no go,
bad timing.

01:52:28.787 --> 01:52:36.786
Sir? Sir? Mr. Churchill, please!

01:52:38.321 --> 01:52:41.219
Forgive me, that was insolent.

01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:49.085
I don't know you, sir. I don't
know the sort of man you are.

01:52:49.087 --> 01:52:53.885
But the office you occupy
permits me to have desires...

01:52:53.887 --> 01:52:56.351
as to the kind of man I would
want you to be.

01:52:56.353 --> 01:52:59.718
Your decisions affect all the
lives of this land.

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:04.121
And I am here, standing before
you, for a single one.

01:53:05.719 --> 01:53:11.218
A complicated, pained and soured
one, but a life nonetheless.

01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:16.185
And therefore deserving and
worthy and precious.

01:53:16.187 --> 01:53:20.651
If you believe, as I would have
you believe...

01:53:20.653 --> 01:53:25.951
that every individual life
deserves its own chance...

01:53:25.953 --> 01:53:29.851
please, hear what I have come
to say.

01:53:29.853 --> 01:53:33.286
Please, sir? All right.

01:53:39.953 --> 01:53:42.819
I suppose I did say
lay it all on.

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:46.953
Charles?

01:53:51.652 --> 01:53:53.817
I will not release Dr. Minor.

01:53:53.819 --> 01:53:55.985
The prime minister won't
countenance it.

01:53:55.987 --> 01:53:58.151
The public won't stand for it.

01:53:58.153 --> 01:54:00.318
Fortunately your lexicon
provides us with the means...

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:02.617
to conceal the unpalatable.

01:54:02.619 --> 01:54:05.984
What I will do is deport
Dr. Minor.

01:54:05.986 --> 01:54:07.817
I gather he has family
in Connecticut.

01:54:07.819 --> 01:54:08.951
He does, sir.

01:54:08.953 --> 01:54:10.684
I shall let the board know,
should he be released...

01:54:10.686 --> 01:54:12.318
he is to be sent home.

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:15.650
Undesirable alien... let America
manage her errant son.

01:54:15.652 --> 01:54:18.884
Settle this matter, Dr. Murray.
Go back to your work.

01:54:18.886 --> 01:54:23.084
The nation has need of you, and
allow me to get back to mine.

01:54:23.086 --> 01:54:25.884
Thank you, sir.

01:54:25.886 --> 01:54:27.619
- Congratulations, doctor.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:54:59.619 --> 01:55:02.018
May I introduce you to Freddie
Furnivall.

01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:05.283
- It is an honor, doctor.
- That is impossible.

01:55:05.285 --> 01:55:06.819
They're ready, sir.

01:55:17.352 --> 01:55:19.283
Ah, wait a moment, please.

01:55:19.285 --> 01:55:20.484
Yes, sir.

01:55:20.486 --> 01:55:26.551
I'll be right here, William,
right over there. All right?

01:55:31.719 --> 01:55:33.283
That's good, and
if you can hold on three...

01:55:33.285 --> 01:55:37.017
one, two, three.

01:55:45.753 --> 01:55:49.219
This is ours. Something to read
on the ship.

01:55:52.885 --> 01:55:55.750
Does she know?

01:55:55.752 --> 01:55:56.786
She does.

01:55:58.319 --> 01:56:04.716
Tell her I... you'll tell her
then.

01:56:04.718 --> 01:56:06.985
I will.

01:56:28.085 --> 01:56:31.949
Have you seen the latest proof
of the front cover?

01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:36.083
You see, the fortunate thing
about these awful people...

01:56:36.085 --> 01:56:40.249
is they believe in the divine
right of rule of the monarch.

01:56:40.251 --> 01:56:42.249
Their system falls to pieces if
they don't abide...

01:56:42.251 --> 01:56:44.949
by its silly intricacies.

01:56:44.951 --> 01:56:47.916
So, we use it against them.

01:56:47.918 --> 01:56:49.783
Your book is safe, James.

01:56:49.785 --> 01:56:52.149
You are safe at its helm for as
long as you wish...

01:56:52.151 --> 01:56:57.018
or until you shuffle off this
mortal coil.

01:56:59.817 --> 01:57:01.916
- Yes.
- What now?

01:57:01.918 --> 01:57:05.216
Now and forever beyond, my dear
Gell...

01:57:05.218 --> 01:57:09.182
Dr. Murray is the dictionary.

01:57:09.184 --> 01:57:11.016
Perhaps you should consider
taking a rest.

01:57:11.018 --> 01:57:15.783
I hear the South of France
is quite the place...

01:57:15.785 --> 01:57:17.918
for recharging one's spirits.
