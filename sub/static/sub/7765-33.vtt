00:14.160 --> 00:15.220
<i>And Dolfph!</i>

00:15.320 --> 00:17.900
<i>Together they are Mercury Heat!</i>

00:18.000 --> 00:20.140

00:20.240 --> 00:23.020
<i>deathâdefying performances,</i>

00:23.120 --> 00:25.300

<i>All their secrets finally</i>

00:40.840 --> 00:42.020
Both: Ohhhhh!

00:42.120 --> 00:44.460
Mercury Heat!

00:44.560 --> 00:46.720
I can't believe Margaret got us
special press passes,

00:46.800 --> 00:48.980
compliments of Channel 6!

00:49.080 --> 00:52.220
Mordecai and Rigby!

00:52.320 --> 00:54.780
You took a DTV
from the Domeâitory!

00:54.880 --> 00:57.180
âDTâwhat?
âDTV.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.540
You know, that very expensive
piece of machinery

00:59.640 --> 01:00.820
parked outside.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.100
Oh, yeah.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.200
We were only gonna use it
for like a minute.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.940
Is that so?

01:05.040 --> 01:08.560
Well, I've got surveillance
photos that say otherwise!

01:11.640 --> 01:13.780
Oh, boy.

01:13.880 --> 01:14.860
( Chuckling )

01:14.960 --> 01:16.260
Can it!

01:16.360 --> 01:18.460
I am so sorry for this,
Dr. Langer.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.460
The DTVs are meant for
scientific research.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.860
They could have ruined
weeks of data.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.380
There was a line there,
and your guys crossed it.

01:26.480 --> 01:30.940
That's why I'm enacting
a 24âhour lockdown.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.100
âWhat?
âNo way!

01:32.200 --> 01:34.580
And Benson here
is gonna make sure

01:34.680 --> 01:35.980
you don't leave the house.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.740
'Cause if you do,
he's fired.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.460
What?
You can't do that!

01:40.560 --> 01:41.420
Oh, yeah?

01:41.520 --> 01:43.580
Who's gonna stop me?
You?

01:43.680 --> 01:45.260
âUh...
âThat's what I thought.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.840
Keep them in line or
we'll keep them in line for you!

01:50.240 --> 01:51.780
( Groans )

01:51.880 --> 01:53.260
I can't believe this!

01:53.360 --> 01:55.720
Come on, Benson. You know
these dome rules are ridiculous.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.020
Yeah. You're just too afraid
to do anything about it.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.620
I don't want to hear it.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.180
Lockdown! 24 hours!
Starting now!

02:03.280 --> 02:04.660
Get inside!

02:04.760 --> 02:06.140
Aw, dude!

02:06.240 --> 02:08.400
There is no way
we're missing Mercury Heat.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.300
( Slurps )

02:12.400 --> 02:14.620
No one's getting past me.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.180
No sir.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.100
Thanks for helping us out,
Pops.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.500
Of course!

02:19.600 --> 02:21.940
I've just about had it
with these dome rules.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.460
They're absolute rubbish,
if you ask me.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.560
How are you gonna distract
Benson?

02:25.920 --> 02:27.500
Leave that to me.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.180
( Discordant notes )

02:29.280 --> 02:30.500
Wow, Pops.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.540
That's very impressive.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.220
I've never had
a single lesson.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.780
But I think my ears
are tired now, so ââ

02:38.880 --> 02:41.020
Well, then.
Let's wake them up!

02:41.120 --> 02:42.900
( Discordant notes )

02:52.360 --> 02:54.220
Best spot ever!

02:54.320 --> 02:56.620
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.
Rubber baby buggy bumpers.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.340
Look!
Here they come!

02:58.440 --> 03:00.440
( Whoosh! )

03:01.840 --> 03:03.980
Both: Whooooa!

03:09.160 --> 03:10.940
( Coughs ) Wow.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.340
What an entrance.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.160
Del Hanlon,
reporter on Channel 6 News.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.300
Hey.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.340
Dude, I can't believe
we almost missed this.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.900
Good thing
our plan is foolproof.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.380
( Crickets chirping )

03:25.040 --> 03:27.160
( <i>Snoring)</i>

03:35.760 --> 03:37.760
( Ropes creaking )

03:39.720 --> 03:40.700
Hmm.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.180
Hmm.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.460
Yeah.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.560
You better sleep.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.060
Good evening. We have
a very special treat tonight.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.980
After years
of avoiding the press,

03:52.080 --> 03:53.900
rock sensation Mercury Heat

03:54.000 --> 03:56.460
is with us for
our very exclusive interview.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.460
Del Hanlon reports.
Del.

03:58.560 --> 04:02.300
Margaret, I got to say,
it's getting pretty warm up here

04:02.400 --> 04:05.140
'cause these guys
are bringing in the heat.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.340
Or should I say
Mercury Heat!

04:07.440 --> 04:10.340
( Laughs )

04:10.440 --> 04:13.660
You know, 'cause, uh ââ
( Clears throat )

04:13.760 --> 04:15.760
Now, you guys have been
performing together

04:15.200 --> 04:16.620
for a while now.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.980
The fans must know ââ
do you like it?

04:19.080 --> 04:20.660
Yeah.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.900
Incredible!

04:22.000 --> 04:24.580
Now,
another burning question

04:24.680 --> 04:26.500
for all the true Mercury Heads
out there.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.060
Your performances
are pretty loud.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.020
How is that on your ears?

04:31.120 --> 04:33.260
Aah! Dude, what kind of question
was that?

04:33.360 --> 04:35.780
What was that?
We actually hear very well.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.240
You got some questions for us?
Actually, we do.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.720
Like, why does the
fourâminuteâlong guitar solo

04:40.160 --> 04:42.140
in the song "Flames Forever"
end so abruptly?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.700
Yeah.
Is it true it's because

04:43.800 --> 04:45.960
the mysterious fifth member
died while recording it?

04:46.040 --> 04:47.380
I want answers!

04:47.480 --> 04:49.780
Finally.
Some real questions

04:49.880 --> 04:51.300
You. Out.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.300
You two. In.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.260
( Both gasp )

04:53.360 --> 04:55.600
And, scene.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.700
( Munching )

05:01.800 --> 05:03.940
Hmm.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.740
I can't believe Mordecai and
Rigby said that to me earlier.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.220
"Meh, Benson,
you're just too afraid

05:09.320 --> 05:11.140
to anything about
the dome rules."

05:11.240 --> 05:13.240
Who do those guys
think they are?

05:12.720 --> 05:14.380
I'm their boss,
for crying out loud!

05:14.480 --> 05:17.300
I don't think you're mad
at Mordecai and Rigby.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.740
I think you're just mad
at Dr. Langer

05:19.840 --> 05:22.380
'cause he's technically
the boss now and you're not.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.660
Oh,
that's completely not true.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.740
( Machine beeps )
Oh, great.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.840
Now there's a malfunction
with the dome door

05:28.480 --> 05:29.820
and I have to go fix it.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.560
Skips, make sure Mordecai and
Rigby don't leave the house.

05:34.680 --> 05:38.020
<i>That's another great question,</i>
<i>um, what was your name again?</i>

05:38.120 --> 05:40.540
<i>âMordecââ</i>
<i>âPizza for only $5!</i>

05:40.640 --> 05:42.380
âWhat was that?
âOh, uh...

05:42.480 --> 05:45.700
they're selling
<i>morepizza for $5.</i>

05:45.800 --> 05:47.700
Huh. What a deal.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.020
We'll order some
when I get back.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.900
Those two have really done it
this time.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.780
And that's when I realized,
like,

05:54.880 --> 05:56.900
I wasn't mad at the world,
you know?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.500
I was mad at myself.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.060
â( Cries )
âThere, there, Vince.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.220
Cut the cameras!
Cut the cameras!

06:03.320 --> 06:06.900
That was the best interview
anyone's ever given us.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
So, want to come party with us
on our private jet?

06:08.880 --> 06:10.740
Both: Yeah, we do!

06:10.840 --> 06:12.820
Lousy dome scientists.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.140
Don't tell me what to do.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.780
Huh?

06:16.880 --> 06:19.340
( Groans )

06:19.440 --> 06:23.660
Mordecai and Rigby!

06:23.760 --> 06:25.540
( Grunts )

06:25.640 --> 06:27.580
Aah!

06:27.680 --> 06:29.180
( Screams )

06:29.280 --> 06:31.280
Oh, dear.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.200
Yeah, so I want to
graduate high school

06:33.800 --> 06:35.800
to impress my dad,
you know?

06:35.040 --> 06:37.100
( Groans )
I know what you mean, man.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.660
All the fans in the world
can't replace a father's love.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.760
Hey.
I know what'll cheer you up.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.100
Hey, Stan. Can we get
a barrel roll, please?

06:46.200 --> 06:48.240
Anything for Mercury Heat.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.020
All: Whoa!

06:53.120 --> 06:54.860
All: Whoo!

06:54.960 --> 06:56.260
Again! Again!

06:56.360 --> 06:59.060
Dude. This is seriously
the best night of my life.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.120
( Cellphone rings, vibrates )
Hello?

07:01.080 --> 07:02.500
The jig is up!

07:02.600 --> 07:04.900
Benson just sealed off
the entrance to the dome!

07:05.000 --> 07:07.900
Aw, man. Pops, you stall him
till we get back.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.460
Benson's onto us! He's gonna
find out we're not at the park!

07:10.560 --> 07:12.620
What?! There's no way
we can get back in time!

07:12.720 --> 07:14.580
There might be a way.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.680
You ever wear
one of these?

07:18.360 --> 07:20.340
Rah!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.440
( Grunts )

07:25.800 --> 07:27.780
Pops?!

07:27.880 --> 07:29.860
( <i>Snoring)</i>

07:29.960 --> 07:32.220
( Grunts )
What's going on here?

07:32.320 --> 07:33.700
Oh, Benson!

07:33.800 --> 07:35.020
I'm, uh ââ

07:35.120 --> 07:37.340
I'm just as surprised
as you!

07:37.440 --> 07:39.340
They snuck out!
I knew it!

07:39.440 --> 07:42.440
I'm gonna fire them
before Dr. Langer fires me!

07:43.880 --> 07:46.020
So, once we get close
to the dome,

07:46.120 --> 07:48.540
spread your wings and coast
through the moon door.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.140
I don't know about this!

07:50.240 --> 07:51.580
Of course you do!

07:51.680 --> 07:53.980
Just follow your dreams!
( Grunts )

07:54.080 --> 07:57.500
âAah!
âAah!

07:57.600 --> 08:00.360
Whoo!
Rock on!

08:06.440 --> 08:07.660
Look out!

08:07.760 --> 08:09.580
âOw!
âAah!

08:09.680 --> 08:11.540
( Both groan )

08:11.640 --> 08:13.020
Benson: Mordecai and Rigby!

08:13.120 --> 08:14.660
I know you're out here!

08:14.760 --> 08:16.260
Dude!
Benson's coming!

08:16.360 --> 08:18.360
Quick!
Down here!

08:19.760 --> 08:21.340
( Both panting )

08:21.440 --> 08:23.580
I think we lost him.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.100
Mordecai!

08:25.200 --> 08:26.420
Rigby!

08:26.520 --> 08:28.820
Where are you?

08:28.920 --> 08:29.940
Come on! Hurry!

08:30.040 --> 08:31.140
( Growling )

08:31.240 --> 08:32.860
Wait.
What's that sound?

08:32.960 --> 08:36.240
It's coming from down there.
( Growling )

08:43.640 --> 08:44.700
Both: Aah!

08:44.800 --> 08:46.540
( Both panting )

08:46.640 --> 08:48.640
( Grunts )

08:50.880 --> 08:52.180
âOhhh.
âOhhh.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.340
There you are!

08:53.440 --> 08:55.140
Benson!
Something's down there!

08:55.240 --> 08:57.240
There's a huge monster!
It looked right at us!

08:56.840 --> 08:59.140
That's the lamest excuse
I've ever heard.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.860
Benson!

09:00.960 --> 09:02.980
Maybe you misunderstood me.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.540
When I told you to keep them
in the house for 24 hours,

09:06.640 --> 09:07.700
I meant it!

09:07.800 --> 09:09.340
I mean, wow.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.180
All you had to do
was literally

09:11.280 --> 09:14.740
keep them in one place
for a day, but no.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.820
You couldn't even do that.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.740
Now they're out here
wearing those stupid costumes.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.140
So, congratulations,
Mordecai and Rigby!

09:24.240 --> 09:25.500
You're fired!

09:25.600 --> 09:26.660
âWhat?
âHey.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.780
If anyone's gonna fire them,
it's me!

09:28.880 --> 09:30.300
Both: Yeah!

09:30.400 --> 09:32.340
I don't tell you people
how to do your job,

09:32.440 --> 09:33.540
whatever that may be!

09:33.640 --> 09:35.640
So you certainly don't
have the right

09:35.080 --> 09:37.460
to tell me how to do my job!
( Whoosh! )

09:37.560 --> 09:39.940
This is my park.
They're my employees.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.620
You people need to back off
and quit breathing down my neck!

09:42.720 --> 09:44.220
Do I make myself clear?

09:44.320 --> 09:46.020
Um...crystal.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.740
Crystal clear as day.
( Chuckles nervously )

09:48.840 --> 09:50.920
Well, it looks like you got
these two under control.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.260
I'll ââ
I'll just leave you be.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.740
Aah!

09:54.840 --> 09:56.700
( Grunts )

09:56.800 --> 09:58.800
Stupid jetpack.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.460
Both: Whooooa!

10:02.560 --> 10:04.220
We're sorry we made you
look bad, Benson.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.580
Yeah, we're sorry.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.680
But seriously, though,
that was so cool

10:07.320 --> 10:08.820
how you told Langer off
like that.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.900
Hey.
What do you expect?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.540
I'm the boss.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.420
And as your boss, it's
my decision not to fire you.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.500
âWhoo!
âWhoo!

10:17.600 --> 10:18.460
For now.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.660
âYeah!
âYeah!

10:19.760 --> 10:21.300
Now,
take off those costumes.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.400
You two look ridiculous.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.100
They're ready.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.760
And I'm going to the hospital.
