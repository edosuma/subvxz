WEBVTT

00:01.734 --> 00:03.768
No, really. I did.
Yeah right.

00:03.769 --> 00:06.070
You're just making excuses
'cause you missed an easy shot.

00:06.071 --> 00:09.040
I chose not to hit the golf ball
in the giant clown's mouth

00:09.041 --> 00:11.676
because I didn't want
to cause internal injuries.

00:11.677 --> 00:14.245
I had a great time
tonight, Sabrina.

00:14.246 --> 00:15.546
Me too.

00:16.949 --> 00:18.984
Harvey, you're doing it again.

00:18.985 --> 00:20.185
Sorry.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.886
I was just wondering
where you're at with

00:21.887 --> 00:24.555
the me-or-Dashiell, my-short-
life-will-come-to-an-abrupt-end

00:24.556 --> 00:26.291
if-you-don't-
pick-me situation?

00:26.292 --> 00:29.528
Well, it would help me
to know where <i>you</i> stood.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.262
I just haven't
made up my mind yet.

00:32.064 --> 00:33.631
Oh! Dashiell!

00:33.632 --> 00:37.502
Um-- Oh, you got
a delivery job at the florist

00:37.503 --> 00:39.971
who has keys
to our house.

00:39.972 --> 00:41.906
For you.

00:41.907 --> 00:44.576
So who's it going to be?

00:44.577 --> 00:47.278
Me, or, uh...?

00:47.279 --> 00:50.015
I'm sorry. I forgot your name.

00:50.016 --> 00:51.783
I know you guys
want a decision,

00:51.784 --> 00:53.185
and you've been really patient.

00:53.186 --> 00:54.386
It's just that I'm...

00:54.387 --> 00:55.820
talking to
frozen people.

00:55.821 --> 00:57.121
Sabrina.

00:57.122 --> 00:58.756
We did that
to Harvey and Dashiell.

00:58.757 --> 01:00.525
We just couldn't wait
to give you the news.

01:00.526 --> 01:02.527
Don't worry, they think
they're in line at the bank.

01:02.528 --> 01:05.764
"Sabrina Spellman, please
join us tomorrow for a ceremony

01:05.765 --> 01:08.032
honoring you for receiving
your witches' license."

01:08.033 --> 01:09.601
( all yelling )

01:09.602 --> 01:11.236
This is so great,
and when I feel great

01:11.237 --> 01:12.236
I get suspicious.

01:12.237 --> 01:13.839
What's the catch?
No catch.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.440
And once you get
your witches' license,

01:15.441 --> 01:17.074
you'll automatically
have all the power

01:17.075 --> 01:18.776
and knowledge in the universe
inside of you.

01:18.777 --> 01:20.045
And thanks
to modern medicine,

01:20.046 --> 01:22.280
it no longer requires
invasive surgery.

01:22.281 --> 01:23.414
So I'll be able to decide

01:23.415 --> 01:24.549
between Harvey and Dash?

01:24.550 --> 01:26.384
Yeah.
What are we waiting for?

01:26.385 --> 01:27.719
Let's go celebrate!

01:28.988 --> 01:29.987
You two remind me

01:29.988 --> 01:31.956
of my first wife
on our honeymoon.

01:31.957 --> 01:33.090
Heh-heh. Yowah.

01:33.091 --> 01:35.126
Good night, everybody.
Drive carefully.

02:00.519 --> 02:02.153
( <i>mellow rock theme playing</i> )

02:02.154 --> 02:04.255
MR. KRAFT:
Okay. Attention, everyone.

02:04.256 --> 02:07.024
As you all know,
this year Westbridge High

02:07.025 --> 02:10.529
ranked number one in the county
on the school board exams.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.063
And so to celebrate

02:12.064 --> 02:15.566
what I can only assume
to be flagrant cheating

02:15.567 --> 02:18.136
on the part
of the entire student body,

02:18.137 --> 02:21.605
Principal Larue is
giving you a dance this Friday.

02:21.606 --> 02:22.941
( all cheering )

02:22.942 --> 02:25.510
And the theme of the dance
is a movie

02:25.511 --> 02:27.778
to be selected
by an honor student

02:27.779 --> 02:32.117
who did particularly well
on the exams--

02:32.118 --> 02:33.351
Oh, boy.

02:34.253 --> 02:36.488
--Sabrina Spellman.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.789
( applause )

02:41.627 --> 02:43.762
Sabrina, will you go
to the dance with me?

02:43.763 --> 02:45.263
Oh, I, uh...

02:45.264 --> 02:47.666
DASHIELL:
Hey, Sabrina, you wanna go to
the dance with me?

02:47.667 --> 02:48.733
Down here!

02:50.002 --> 02:51.469
Agh! Oh, um...

02:51.470 --> 02:52.670
I take it that's a no?

02:52.671 --> 02:54.171
Look, I can, uh--

02:54.172 --> 02:55.507
I can give you
an answer tomorrow,

02:55.508 --> 02:58.109
but first I have to go
give the chef my compliments.

02:59.211 --> 03:00.245
Dashiell,

03:00.246 --> 03:01.746
you're gonna
get me in trouble.

03:01.747 --> 03:04.282
I-I can't be talking to you
when you're in a cream sauce.

03:04.283 --> 03:06.751
I can't be responsible
for my actions, Sabrina.

03:06.752 --> 03:08.286
I care about you
too much.

03:08.287 --> 03:09.754
Oh, that's sweet.

03:09.755 --> 03:10.789
You know, I had a lot of fun

03:10.790 --> 03:12.524
going to dinner
in Atlantis the other night.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.427
The fish was good, but
the chips were kind of soggy.

03:15.428 --> 03:18.296
Great, so say yes
and go to the dance with me.

03:18.297 --> 03:20.565
Look, I can
tell you more tomorrow.

03:20.566 --> 03:22.867
I'll know so much more about
everything tomorrow.

03:24.636 --> 03:26.371
( yells )

03:26.372 --> 03:28.172
There's nothing
greater in life

03:28.173 --> 03:31.041
than creaming someone
in chess over the Internet.

03:31.042 --> 03:32.210
You said
the same thing last week

03:32.211 --> 03:33.578
about finding
food in the couch.

03:33.579 --> 03:35.079
Okay, bye.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.348
That was Mr. Kraft.

03:36.349 --> 03:38.683
He wants us to chaperone
the dance with him Friday night.

03:38.684 --> 03:39.918
I told him
we'd love to.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.552
Oh, no.

03:41.553 --> 03:44.856
Me and Willard Kraft
at a dimly lit dance together.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.558
Ugh, you know what that means.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.493
A stolen moment
in the janitor's closet?

03:49.494 --> 03:52.564
No. It means I'll have to spend
my whole evening avoiding him.

03:52.565 --> 03:56.066
Which means no time to make fun
of how the awkward kids dance.

03:56.067 --> 03:58.503
I may have the answer
to your troubles.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.438
What if I asked him
to be <i>my</i> date?

04:00.439 --> 04:02.941
Oh, I couldn't
ask you to do that.

04:02.942 --> 04:06.011
Well, actually, I...
find him attractive.

04:07.379 --> 04:11.483
Oh, no. Salem,
Zelda has a brain lesion.

04:11.484 --> 04:13.485
If you have any problem
with it whatsoever,

04:13.486 --> 04:15.252
I-- I-- I won't ask him.

04:15.253 --> 04:16.687
Me?

04:16.688 --> 04:18.156
Why would I have
a problem with it?

04:18.156 --> 04:20.757
I mean,
he's not my boyfriend.

04:20.759 --> 04:24.129
You know, in fact,
you would be doing me a favor.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.563
Well, great.

04:25.564 --> 04:27.064
Then I'll ask him.

04:27.065 --> 04:30.267
Wow, you must feel
like a huge loser.

04:31.303 --> 04:32.503
Huh? Who said that?

04:33.138 --> 04:34.605
Oh!

04:36.141 --> 04:37.675
( laughing )
Miss Spellman,

04:37.676 --> 04:39.143
have you reached
a decision

04:39.144 --> 04:40.478
on a movie theme
for the dance yet?

04:40.479 --> 04:42.046
Oh, well, I was
kind of leaning towards

04:42.047 --> 04:44.615
either <i>Saturday Night</i>
<i>Fever</i> or <i>Grease.</i>

04:44.616 --> 04:46.818
I've never heard of those films.

04:46.819 --> 04:47.852
Really?

04:47.853 --> 04:49.620
Did you hear
World War II ended?

04:50.589 --> 04:51.956
Miss Spellman,
you should be aware

04:51.957 --> 04:54.659
that I have final approval
on your choice.

04:54.660 --> 04:59.196
Therefore, I strongly suggest
that you chose my favorite film,

04:59.197 --> 05:01.065
<i>Billy Jack.</i>

05:01.066 --> 05:02.099
I've never heard of it.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.268
You're just saying that

05:03.269 --> 05:04.803
because I just said it.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.671
No, I-- I really haven't,

05:06.672 --> 05:08.640
and I think that it
should really be my--

05:08.641 --> 05:10.842
( disco music playing )

05:10.843 --> 05:12.743
Look, I told
you kids

05:12.744 --> 05:16.347
boom boxes are not allowed
on school property.

05:16.348 --> 05:17.215
And I was--

05:18.784 --> 05:22.320
That's it. No more buying
sushi at the gas station.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.490
( <i>disco music playing</i> )

05:28.861 --> 05:31.495
Just think, Salem,
after today's ceremony

05:31.496 --> 05:33.898
I'll be able to choose
between Harvey and Dash.

05:33.899 --> 05:35.299
My life will be forever changed.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.968
Well, what's a good
countermove when someone

05:36.969 --> 05:38.236
steals your bishop?

05:38.237 --> 05:39.670
You didn't hear a word I said.

05:39.671 --> 05:43.240
Sabrina, an Albanian potato
farmer is whupping me in chess.

05:43.241 --> 05:46.277
You gotta help me.
I hate to lose.

05:46.278 --> 05:50.048
Well, sorry, Salem,
I don't know how to play chess.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.016
So I guess you're just gonna
have to accept your fate,

05:52.017 --> 05:53.951
and learn to lose
with some dignity.

05:53.952 --> 05:56.487
Would you at least
help me type in my response?

05:57.589 --> 06:01.526
"Dear Yuri,
you have a big nose..."

06:01.527 --> 06:02.894
Salem, I'm not
typing that.

06:02.895 --> 06:03.894
You didn't
let me finish.

06:03.895 --> 06:05.129
I was gonna say,

06:05.130 --> 06:07.197
"You have a big nose,
for an ignorant monkey."

06:07.198 --> 06:09.099
Now, chop-chop,
start typing.

06:09.735 --> 06:11.235
Is it facial hair?

06:11.236 --> 06:13.771
Do you have an unquenchable
desire for men with facial hair?

06:13.772 --> 06:15.907
Hilda, will you
please stop?

06:15.908 --> 06:18.109
I'm not gonna tell you
why I like Willard.

06:18.110 --> 06:19.143
Willard?

06:19.144 --> 06:21.579
Oh, now you're
calling him Willard.

06:21.580 --> 06:22.980
Gee, Zelda,
when's the wedding?

06:24.949 --> 06:27.885
Honey, oh,
you look beautiful.

06:27.886 --> 06:29.654
Thanks. I'm a little nervous
about getting

06:29.655 --> 06:30.922
my witches' license.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.223
I wish you guys
could go with me.

06:32.224 --> 06:34.359
I know, but parents and
guardians have been banned

06:34.360 --> 06:36.027
ever since the invention
of the camcorder.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.029
Well, take a good look.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.398
This may be my last
moment of humility.

06:41.266 --> 06:42.666
( thunder crashes )

06:42.667 --> 06:45.670
Does he have some inheritance
that I don't know about?

06:49.441 --> 06:51.142
Hi. There must be
some mistake.

06:51.143 --> 06:53.244
I was supposed to be at a party
for my witches' license.

06:53.245 --> 06:54.445
My name is Sabrina Spellman.

06:54.446 --> 06:56.346
Nope. You're in
the right place.

06:56.347 --> 06:57.414
It can't be.

06:57.415 --> 07:00.050
It's supposed to be
this huge celebration.

07:00.051 --> 07:01.952
Look, I can take care of this
all at home.

07:01.953 --> 07:03.420
Um, could I have my license?

07:03.421 --> 07:06.457
You have to complete one more
test before I can issue it.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.293
What's the test?

07:08.294 --> 07:11.128
What is the most dangerous time
to ride your vacuum?

07:11.129 --> 07:16.934
During A, heavy rain,
B, light rain, C, hail.

07:16.935 --> 07:18.302
Really? That's the whole test?

07:18.303 --> 07:20.205
A, B, or C,
please.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.039
Well, that's easy.
B, light rain.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.807
Congratulations, you passed.

07:23.808 --> 07:25.075
And please remember

07:25.076 --> 07:27.278
witching is a privilege,
not a right.

07:29.514 --> 07:31.448
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

07:32.985 --> 07:34.385
Now, this is
more like it.

07:34.386 --> 07:36.920
ALL:
¶ For she's a jolly good witch ¶

07:36.921 --> 07:39.690
¶ For she's
A jolly good witch ¶

07:39.691 --> 07:42.994
¶ For she's a jolly good witch ¶

07:42.995 --> 07:46.564
¶ Which nobody can deny ¶

07:46.565 --> 07:48.499
( applause, cheering )

07:50.702 --> 07:52.736
Wow, you guys made it.

07:52.737 --> 07:54.639
Sorry we had to fool you,
but there's this silly rule

07:54.640 --> 07:56.373
that if you tell anyone
about their ceremony,

07:56.374 --> 07:58.343
the Witches' Council
cuts your tongue out.

07:58.344 --> 07:59.510
I see hors d'oeuvres.

08:00.579 --> 08:04.115
Sabrina, I believe you two
have already met.

08:04.116 --> 08:05.950
This is your cousin, Doris.

08:05.951 --> 08:08.152
Wow, you were in on this
the whole time?

08:08.153 --> 08:09.453
How'd you keep a straight face?

08:09.454 --> 08:11.221
I was classically trained.

08:11.222 --> 08:12.556
Oh, well, it's nice to meet--

08:12.557 --> 08:13.424
( flashbulb pops )

08:14.093 --> 08:15.059
--you.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.193
What was that for?

08:16.194 --> 08:18.096
Your witches'
license photo.

08:18.097 --> 08:19.297
But I--
I wasn't ready.

08:19.298 --> 08:20.632
It's gonna be awful.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.767
Hasn't the woman ever heard of
the phrase "cheese"?

08:22.768 --> 08:24.602
Oh, come on, Sabrina.
Everyone thinks they've got

08:24.603 --> 08:26.504
the worst witches'
license picture.

08:29.441 --> 08:31.675
ZELDA:
And you'll be no exception.

08:31.676 --> 08:33.977
Oh, Doris, could you take
another one?

08:33.979 --> 08:35.412
This one's terrible.

08:35.413 --> 08:37.715
Are you saying
you don't like my workmanship?

08:37.716 --> 08:40.150
Doris, calm down.
Sabrina didn't mean--

08:40.152 --> 08:42.886
Because when people don't like
my workmanship, I get angry.

08:42.888 --> 08:44.321
And when
I get angry, I--

08:51.396 --> 08:53.197
Okay, you know what?
The picture's fine.

08:53.198 --> 08:54.164
Let's go.

08:54.165 --> 08:55.299
( electric buzz )
Ow.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.534
( buzzes )
Ow!

08:58.704 --> 09:00.971
Sabrina, there's something
we have to tell you.

09:00.972 --> 09:04.108
Besides the fact that
my license is electrocuting me?

09:04.109 --> 09:06.878
Before a witch
can actually use her license,

09:06.879 --> 09:09.180
she has to discover
her family secret.

09:09.181 --> 09:10.548
Excuse me?

09:10.549 --> 09:12.817
Yeah. Our family
has a lot of secrets,

09:12.818 --> 09:14.218
but there's
one in particular

09:14.219 --> 09:15.819
that will break
the spell on your license,

09:15.820 --> 09:17.655
and then you'll
be free to use it.

09:17.656 --> 09:19.790
Trust me, it's a doozy.

09:19.791 --> 09:21.558
And to help you
discover the secret,

09:21.559 --> 09:23.928
family members will
visit us periodically

09:23.929 --> 09:25.396
and serve as your guide.

09:25.397 --> 09:27.097
Doris will be
your first visitor.

09:27.098 --> 09:29.199
I'm looking forward to it.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.535
I can't believe this.

09:30.536 --> 09:32.937
Y-you're telling me
I can't use my license at all?

09:34.039 --> 09:35.139
That means I have to decide

09:35.140 --> 09:36.841
between Harvey
and Dashiell on my own?

09:36.842 --> 09:38.543
Like a normal teenager?

09:38.544 --> 09:40.378
I'm sorry, honey.

09:40.379 --> 09:43.280
This just...stinks.

09:51.022 --> 09:54.458
Sabrina, we need to talk to you
about your decision.

09:54.459 --> 09:56.961
Oh. Right.
Yeah, my decision.

09:56.962 --> 09:59.163
Uh, well, see,
a funny thing happened. I...

09:59.164 --> 10:00.331
You haven't decided yet.

10:00.332 --> 10:02.433
Boy, thanks for
cutting me off there.

10:02.434 --> 10:04.201
I ran outta steam on that one.

10:04.202 --> 10:06.170
Well, we've come to a decision
on our own.

10:06.171 --> 10:07.471
We both really like you,

10:07.472 --> 10:09.206
but we can't keep waiting
like this.

10:09.207 --> 10:11.208
So if you don't decide
by tomorrow,

10:11.209 --> 10:12.476
you don't get either of us.

10:12.477 --> 10:14.011
HARVEY:
And not just
for the dance.

10:14.012 --> 10:14.879
Forever.

10:16.314 --> 10:18.649
You know, maybe
we could do joint custody.

10:18.650 --> 10:20.618
You'd get me
every other Christmas.

10:20.619 --> 10:22.754
Hey. Couldn't
help overhearing.

10:22.755 --> 10:23.754
Was it bad?

10:23.755 --> 10:25.455
Awful. They gave me
an ultimatum.

10:25.456 --> 10:26.791
What am I gonna do?

10:26.792 --> 10:29.627
Uh, jump for joy that
two guys are fighting over you?

10:29.628 --> 10:30.762
It's not that easy.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.195
This is one
of the toughest decisions

10:32.196 --> 10:33.263
I've ever had to make.

10:33.264 --> 10:34.665
I hate to bother you anymore,

10:34.666 --> 10:36.767
but we need to know what theme
you want the dance to be.

10:36.768 --> 10:38.703
Oh, I completely
forgot about that.

10:38.704 --> 10:40.671
Uh...make it <i>Grease.</i>

10:40.672 --> 10:42.306
Okay, but has
Mr. Kraft approved that?

10:42.307 --> 10:45.142
Because I think this Billy Jack
guy might be a friend of his.

10:45.143 --> 10:46.176
I have too much on my mind

10:46.177 --> 10:47.879
to worry about
what Mr. Kraft wants.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.380
Just make it <i>Grease,</i> okay?

10:49.381 --> 10:51.082
Oh, you know,
Mr. Kraft is also open

10:51.083 --> 10:53.250
to a <i>Mother, Jugs</i>
<i>& Speed</i> theme.

10:53.251 --> 10:54.418
( chuckling )

10:54.419 --> 10:56.453
Hilda, what do you think
of this letter?

10:56.454 --> 10:57.822
( clears throat )

10:57.823 --> 11:02.025
"Dear Yuri. Congratulations.
I'm amazed that a person

11:02.026 --> 11:04.562
"of such low intelligence
could defeat me in chess.

11:04.563 --> 11:07.364
Hats off to your mother
for marrying her brother."

11:07.365 --> 11:09.867
I'll stop. After that,
it gets a little mean.

11:09.868 --> 11:12.069
That's nice, Salem.

11:12.070 --> 11:13.470
Is something wrong?

11:13.471 --> 11:14.972
Yes, something's wrong.

11:14.973 --> 11:16.374
Zelda stole my boyfriend.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.541
That's what's wrong.

11:17.542 --> 11:19.777
But I thought
you despised Mr. Kraft.

11:19.778 --> 11:22.046
Last time you went out with him,
you came home and took a bath

11:22.047 --> 11:24.215
like Meryl Streep did
in <i>Silkwood.</i>

11:24.216 --> 11:26.883
Yeah, but haven't you ever had
a person in your life

11:26.884 --> 11:28.219
who you find truly revolting

11:28.220 --> 11:30.588
and the thought of them
touching you makes you gag,

11:30.589 --> 11:34.091
but you keep them around
because they compliment you?

11:34.092 --> 11:36.260
That's what they
teach in church.

11:36.261 --> 11:37.261
What am I gonna do?

11:37.262 --> 11:38.362
Just go down to the school

11:38.363 --> 11:39.963
and ask him to the dance.

11:39.964 --> 11:42.900
He'll get all mushy and say how
he wishes he could go with you.

11:42.901 --> 11:43.901
So you'll feel better,

11:43.902 --> 11:45.502
but you're in no danger
of an actual date,

11:45.503 --> 11:47.738
because you already know
he's going with Zelda.

11:47.739 --> 11:50.341
That's not half bad.

11:50.342 --> 11:52.843
Hey, when you spend eight hours
a day licking your butt

11:52.844 --> 11:55.546
you come up with a good idea
every now and again.

11:57.715 --> 11:59.784
I have to decide between Harvey
and Dashiell by tomorrow,

11:59.785 --> 12:01.752
and I have no idea
who I'm gonna choose.

12:01.753 --> 12:02.887
What am I gonna do?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.556
My dear, sweet,
if not simple, Sabrina.

12:05.557 --> 12:06.891
Haven't you
learned anything

12:06.892 --> 12:08.692
from years of
being under my tutelage?

12:08.693 --> 12:10.627
That squirrels are meaner
than they look?

12:10.628 --> 12:14.064
No. Use the
agic-may ook-bay.

12:14.065 --> 12:15.866
Of course.

12:15.867 --> 12:17.567
Why didn't I think of that?

12:17.568 --> 12:19.569
Look in the Love section,
underneath

12:19.570 --> 12:21.638
"King, comma,
marriages of Larry."

12:22.774 --> 12:24.509
Oh. Here's one
that will give you

12:24.510 --> 12:26.644
a physical manifestation
of your feelings.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.346
It says here
if I use this spell correctly,

12:28.347 --> 12:29.813
my heart
will be revealed to me.

12:29.814 --> 12:30.881
Sounds gory.

12:30.882 --> 12:32.483
Nah. The only spell
that's literal

12:32.484 --> 12:34.251
is the heart-on-your-sleeve
spell.

12:34.252 --> 12:36.420
This just shows
your true heart's desire.

12:36.421 --> 12:38.155
All I have to do
is sing the following song

12:38.156 --> 12:41.092
while placing my hand
over my chest.

12:41.093 --> 12:45.263
I feel kind of stupid, but at
this point I'll try anything.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.265
¶ What's it all about
Alfie? ¶

12:48.266 --> 12:51.068
¶ Is it just for
The moment we live? ¶

12:51.069 --> 12:54.104
( weeping ):
This song always
makes me cry.

12:54.105 --> 12:57.274
¶ What's it all
About, Alfie? ¶

12:57.275 --> 12:58.609
VALERIE:
Hey, Sabrina?

12:58.610 --> 12:59.976
Mr. Kraft found out
you picked <i>Grease,</i>

12:59.977 --> 13:01.345
and he's looking for you.

13:01.346 --> 13:02.513
When does that man
do his job?

13:02.514 --> 13:03.847
He's furious.

13:03.848 --> 13:06.450
Apparently, he already had
a <i>Billy Jack</i> outfit.

13:06.451 --> 13:08.452
And I don't mean he had
it made for the party.

13:08.453 --> 13:11.922
I mean he already
had it. Scary.

13:11.923 --> 13:14.091
Well, you shouldn't
be seen with me.

13:14.092 --> 13:15.359
Save yourself.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.693
Thanks.
This is me leaving.

13:19.398 --> 13:21.298
( spurs jangling )

13:24.169 --> 13:25.669
Harvey?

13:25.670 --> 13:28.305
( <i>Western gunslinger</i>
<i>theme playing</i> )

13:28.306 --> 13:30.874
Okay. I'm gonna have to start
helping you buy your clothes.

13:30.875 --> 13:32.009
( spurs jangling )

13:45.590 --> 13:48.392
Oh, no.
This must be the spell.

13:48.393 --> 13:51.128
They're gonna fight
over my heart.

13:51.129 --> 13:54.064
Being a witch would be a lot
easier without all the magic.

14:04.943 --> 14:06.410
So, Dashiell,

14:06.411 --> 14:09.246
gotta ask yourself:

14:09.247 --> 14:10.914
do you feel lucky?

14:13.685 --> 14:15.485
I've always been lucky.

14:21.859 --> 14:25.829
Hey. Look,
is that Vince Lombardi?

14:25.830 --> 14:27.498
It was worth a shot.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.733
Oh, Sabrina, there you are.

14:29.734 --> 14:30.867
Oh, uh...

14:30.868 --> 14:33.304
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

14:33.305 --> 14:35.305
Mr. Kraft, if you hear anything
in the next few minutes

14:35.306 --> 14:36.606
that sounds like gunshots

14:36.607 --> 14:38.642
and the last pleading cries
of a dying man, it's not.

14:38.643 --> 14:40.378
No, please, do not try
to change the subject.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.079
I am here to talk
about the dance.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.448
I don't hear anything, do you?

14:44.449 --> 14:46.983
Well, I thought I just
heard myself speaking.

14:46.984 --> 14:48.485
Really? I don't.

14:48.486 --> 14:50.020
Uh, I should go
have my ears checked.

14:50.021 --> 14:50.854
Sabrina--

14:50.855 --> 14:51.822
( horse galloping away )

14:54.126 --> 14:57.761
That's funny, I don't remember
this school having a blacksmith.

14:57.762 --> 15:00.230
( <i>urgent theme playing</i> )

15:00.231 --> 15:01.198
Where'd they go?

15:01.199 --> 15:02.799
Don't hurt me.
I got a family.

15:08.006 --> 15:11.708
Valerie, has anything been
weird in the cafeteria?

15:11.709 --> 15:13.110
The milk is fresh today.

15:13.111 --> 15:15.479
Good. That's good.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.115
Good. Everything will be fine
as soon as I stop saying good.

15:20.585 --> 15:21.785
( grunting )

15:28.893 --> 15:30.394
( phony French accent ):
Prepare to die.

15:30.395 --> 15:32.997
My love of Sabrina
is greater than my love

15:32.998 --> 15:35.332
of not bathing
and movies with no plot.

15:38.736 --> 15:41.672
Pardon. <i>Aprez-vous.</i>

15:41.673 --> 15:42.539
Oh, <i>merci.</i>

15:42.540 --> 15:43.507
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

15:44.342 --> 15:45.643
( yells )

15:47.045 --> 15:48.179
Those drama students.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.414
You know, they really need
a lot of attention.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.617
( <i>urgent theme continues</i> )

15:55.386 --> 15:56.654
Sabrina?

15:56.655 --> 15:58.388
Sabri--

15:58.389 --> 16:00.423
( Southern accent ):
Well, my, my, Willard.

16:00.424 --> 16:03.594
Just the vice principal
I wanted to see.

16:03.595 --> 16:05.496
( laughing ):
Hilda, what are you
doing here?

16:05.497 --> 16:08.365
Well, I've come to
see you, silly puss.

16:08.366 --> 16:10.834
I wanna talk
about you and me

16:10.835 --> 16:13.837
and a little dance
we're going to on Friday night.

16:13.838 --> 16:15.472
Oh...

16:15.473 --> 16:17.007
Hilda, I thought you knew.

16:17.008 --> 16:19.309
Your sister
already asked me.

16:19.310 --> 16:20.378
She did?

16:20.379 --> 16:22.013
Well, fiddlesticks on her.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.115
How dare she take
my man away from me?

16:25.149 --> 16:27.985
Gee, I had no idea
you felt like this.

16:27.986 --> 16:29.653
I-I mean, you know how I--

16:29.654 --> 16:32.289
How crazy I am about you.
I mean, you--

16:32.290 --> 16:33.891
You're beautiful,
you're funny...

16:33.892 --> 16:35.960
( normal voice ):
Thanks, that's all
I wanted to know.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.494
Well, maybe
some other time, then?

16:37.495 --> 16:38.495
Yeah, I'll call you--

16:38.496 --> 16:39.496
Oh!

16:39.497 --> 16:40.531
( yelling )

16:45.003 --> 16:46.870
Oh, Hilda.

16:46.871 --> 16:48.105
How about Saturday night, huh?

16:48.106 --> 16:49.673
I'll make a batch
of Harvey Wallbangers.

16:49.674 --> 16:51.441
We'll put on the History Channel
and just...

16:51.442 --> 16:53.410
( husky voice ):
kiss all night.

16:53.411 --> 16:55.346
Hey! Hey, if you guys
stop fighting,

16:55.347 --> 16:56.313
I'll give you ice cream.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.719
Doris,

17:01.720 --> 17:02.986
what are you doing here?

17:02.987 --> 17:05.355
I'm supposed to talk to you
about the family secret.

17:05.356 --> 17:07.424
Doris, there are two ninjas
fighting to the death

17:07.425 --> 17:09.259
for my love in the
middle of my high school.

17:09.260 --> 17:10.461
Now is not a good time.

17:10.462 --> 17:12.529
You know, I came
all the way over here

17:12.530 --> 17:14.397
on Other Realm
public transportation

17:14.398 --> 17:15.566
so you could talk to me.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.468
This makes me angry.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.635
No. Doris, don't get angry.

17:18.636 --> 17:20.537
Um, I'll ask you about
the family secret.

17:20.538 --> 17:22.205
Uh...
what is it?

17:22.207 --> 17:24.074
Too late.
I'm already angry.

17:24.075 --> 17:25.974
And when I get angry, I...

17:31.215 --> 17:32.549
No!

17:33.385 --> 17:35.819
Harvey!

17:43.594 --> 17:44.828
Well, it looks like you're busy.

17:44.829 --> 17:46.997
I'll come back later.

17:46.998 --> 17:48.566
Dashiell, I'm sorry.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.066
I guess I didn't
get to you.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.335
No. I know what happened.

17:52.336 --> 17:54.538
My big brother warned me
about the spell.

17:54.539 --> 17:55.706
You jumped in front of Harvey

17:55.707 --> 17:57.508
because he's the one
your heart chose.

17:57.509 --> 17:59.910
Wow. So the spell worked.

18:01.345 --> 18:02.479
I'm sorry.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.982
Yeah. Me too.

18:04.983 --> 18:06.817
But I'd still like
to be friends.

18:06.818 --> 18:08.052
I'd like that too.

18:08.053 --> 18:08.986
( laughs )

18:09.988 --> 18:11.421
Y-- Yeah.

18:14.158 --> 18:15.358
Harvey?

18:15.359 --> 18:16.560
Harvey?

18:16.561 --> 18:18.128
Are you okay?

18:18.129 --> 18:20.030
Um, you--
You fell on your head.

18:20.031 --> 18:22.365
Repeatedly,
in various parts of the school.

18:22.366 --> 18:23.366
( groans )

18:23.367 --> 18:25.169
I hope no one saw me.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.903
Harvey,
if you're still up for it,

18:26.904 --> 18:28.605
would you like
to take me to the dance?

18:28.606 --> 18:30.340
Really?

18:30.341 --> 18:32.009
Great.

18:32.010 --> 18:35.913
Could we go somewhere where
someone could look at my spine?

18:37.848 --> 18:39.516
( groans )

18:39.517 --> 18:41.418
( <i>mellow theme playing</i> )

18:41.419 --> 18:43.020
Hey, you're still here.

18:43.021 --> 18:44.754
Shouldn't you
be at the dance?

18:44.755 --> 18:46.556
Yeah, but I'm gonna wait awhile.

18:46.557 --> 18:48.425
I feel so stupid
going without a date.

18:48.426 --> 18:51.128
So paint on half a mustache
and go with yourself.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.095
( doorbell rings )

18:56.100 --> 18:57.000
I am Yuri.

18:57.001 --> 18:58.402
I come to kill Salem.

18:58.403 --> 18:59.970
Uh-oh.

18:59.971 --> 19:02.639
( high-pitched ):
Salem's not here.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.641
Can I help you?

19:03.642 --> 19:07.011
Salem has insulted
my mother for last time.

19:07.012 --> 19:09.646
I will wear
his entrails as hat.

19:09.647 --> 19:10.747
Huh?

19:10.748 --> 19:12.149
You know, Salem's
not here right now,

19:12.150 --> 19:13.750
but I know where
you can find him.

19:13.751 --> 19:16.019
He happens to be at a high
school dance I'm going to.

19:16.020 --> 19:17.955
I'll take you to him. Okay?

19:20.692 --> 19:22.626
Oh, thanks a bunch, Hilda.

19:22.627 --> 19:25.295
I'll never call you stupid
behind your back again.

19:25.296 --> 19:27.597
I didn't do it for you.
I need a date.

19:27.598 --> 19:28.832
And underneath all those pelts

19:28.833 --> 19:31.167
it looks like he's got
a pretty good body.

19:31.168 --> 19:33.437
( rock 'n' roll music plays )

19:40.412 --> 19:42.613
( high-pitched ):
Wow, you look amazing.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.882
Thanks. Why are you
talking like that?

19:44.883 --> 19:47.785
My mom thought for authenticity
I should wear a girdle.

19:47.786 --> 19:49.954
Whalebone is not that giving.

19:49.955 --> 19:51.789
( laughs )

19:51.790 --> 19:53.156
Excuse me.

19:53.157 --> 19:54.591
Mr. Kraft,
I don't remember

19:54.592 --> 19:55.959
your character from <i>Grease.</i>

19:55.960 --> 19:57.761
Were you in
the director's cut?

19:58.696 --> 20:00.530
You know, Sabrina,
when people make fun

20:00.531 --> 20:02.432
of my <i>Billy Jack</i> outfit,

20:02.433 --> 20:05.969
I just go berserk!

20:05.970 --> 20:09.440
Willard, please.
Stop that.

20:09.441 --> 20:10.273
Hi.

20:12.944 --> 20:14.678
You are Salem.

20:14.679 --> 20:15.912
Oh, no, no, no.

20:15.913 --> 20:17.314
This is supposed
to be Billy Jack.

20:17.315 --> 20:19.916
I will eat your eyes
like candy.

20:23.388 --> 20:27.824
¶ But now
There's no better high ¶

20:27.825 --> 20:30.093
Sabrina, there's
no easy way to say this,

20:30.094 --> 20:32.996
so I might as well just say--

20:32.997 --> 20:34.998
Well, how should I put it?

20:34.999 --> 20:37.534
Harvey, you're babbling.

20:37.535 --> 20:39.270
Will you go steady
with me again?

20:39.271 --> 20:40.571
Really?

20:40.572 --> 20:42.039
I'd love to.

20:42.040 --> 20:46.977
¶ Hopelessly devoted to you ¶

20:48.079 --> 20:51.615
¶ Ooh, ooh
Ooh ¶

20:51.616 --> 20:56.787
¶ Hopelessly devoted to you ¶
