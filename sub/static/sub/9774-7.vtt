Yeah.

MARVIN: Shit, maybe boss is on the wagon.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.048
It look like Christmas up in here. Come on.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.483
He)', guys, which one?

Ante up, boss. No one's exempt.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.690
What are you telling me? It was my idea.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.524
- All right, take it easy.
- SCOTT: Richie, artists,

02:33.600 --> 02:36.490
program directors expect some,
some wining and dining.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.531
Guys, the job is still the job.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.810
Okay, except now we submit receipts
which will be vetted.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.242
So, before Julie sends a third bottle of Dom

02:45.320 --> 02:47.084
to Jose fucking Feliciano,

02:47.160 --> 02:49.606
you ask yourself if you'd be okay
paying out of pocket.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.444
Act British, spend Yiddish.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.249
Good news is, thanks to some difficult cuts,

02:53.360 --> 02:55.249
payroll's down to 33,000 a month,

02:55.360 --> 02:57.089
which we're still not gonna make.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.285
Uh, no, wait.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.809
- No, definitely won't.

- Put down your pearls, for Christ's sake.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.649
Hey, we're about to turn a corner.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.370
That's exactly what
the Nazis told my Uncle Isaac.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.568
Showers right around the corner.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.841
Fuck Hannibal. He's next year's Stan Free.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.009
We're running lean, guys, hungry.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.161
That's what we want to be.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.205
Mission accomplished.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.686
Okay, let's figure out how to pay our serfs.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.929
Richie's apartment.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.845
Now he's got a fucking abacus.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.287
Okay, first of all, it's a company apartment.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.890
That's funny. I never get to stay there.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.088
I'm out six nights a week, all hours.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.844
- How much is it?
-1,100 a month.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.569
If that breaks us, we deserve to break.

He assumes the payments on the loan,
we net 90 grand.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.363
- That's three months' payroll.
- Yep, just about.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.841
- Cash, too.
- What's the catch?

04:02.920 --> 04:04.410
Got to be now.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.164
- As in?
- As in today.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.163
SKIP: How long have you known about this?

04:08.240 --> 04:10.686
- He's looking at other options.
- At least there's no rush.

04:10.760 --> 04:12.524
Okay, great, listen, I'll draw up a contract.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.364
Don't want to be liable
if the plane crashes or blows up.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.970
- What the fuck you saying?
- What is wrong with you?

04:16.040 --> 04:18.725
- All right, relax.
- Just draw up a simple bill of sale, okay?

04:18.800 --> 04:22.486
- Jesus Christ.
- I'll go, make the deal face-to-face.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.686
You're gonna go?

04:23.760 --> 04:25.888
What, you got nothing better to do
around here?

04:25.960 --> 04:27.485
Lou knows me.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.005
If he balks, I can close him.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.444
Oh, yeah.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.682
Look, I want to clear my head. ls that okay?

04:33.760 --> 04:36.604
Six-hour plane ride. No phone calls.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.489
You can't live without me for a day?

04:38.560 --> 04:39.561
- I'm...
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)

04:41.880 --> 04:43.803
Yikes, did I miss anything?

04:43.880 --> 04:46.121
How could you miss anything
at a partners meeting?

04:46.200 --> 04:48.771
Aw, Skip. What's the buy-in?

04:48.840 --> 04:50.046
I'll go get my change purse.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.121
(LAUGHS)

04:51.440 --> 04:52.885
Focus is playing Wollman next week.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.644
Yodeling fans rejoice.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.006
Their Hocus <i>Pocus</i> is hanging

04:56.080 --> 04:58.242
by bloody fingernails to just south of 40.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.124
That's pretty good for us.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.201
Get a pop on it.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.849
Let me write that down.

05:03.920 --> 05:07.811
-"Get a pop on it."
-(ALL LAUGHING)

05:07.880 --> 05:09.769

- SCOTT: This fucking guy.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.171
Somebody drank their Tang this morning.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.160
Can I sic Corso on ABC?

05:14.240 --> 05:16.083
Use somebody else.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.926
Corso's on another thing.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.931
What? We don't got bread to spread around.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.049
Corso's perfect.
He goes in, he does the Magilla Gorilla thing.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.610
It's Top 40, done.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.290
You know what?

05:27.360 --> 05:28.407
Fine. Whatever.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.406
So let it be written, so let it be done.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.766
As you were, gentlemen.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.842
Hey, uh, the whole gorilla thing,

05:34.920 --> 05:36.809
that just stays with us, right?

05:36.880 --> 05:40.043
I'll make a note of it on the way
to pick up your panty shields.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.086
- Oh!
- She's a regular Phyllis Diller, that one.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.766
(LAUGHTER)

05:46.280 --> 05:47.805
I'm coming with you.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.651
You hate LA.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.484
I hate everywhere.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.846
SCOTT: Where's breakfast?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.365
ZAK: Where the fuck is Clark with the donuts?

05:54.440 --> 05:56.363
- Or did we cut those, too?
- SKIP: Wouldn't surprise me.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.171
You don't need a donut.

You realize Jim Morrison had
his last three-way on this plane?

06:31.960 --> 06:33.291
Far as I know.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.288
So, Devon, huh?

06:46.840 --> 06:47.887
Still no call?

06:47.960 --> 06:49.928
No, she calls plenty.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.849
She calls the accountant, calls the lawyer.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.081
Hmm.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.730
Well, not like you can blame her.

One can't undo a perception
once perceived, Zak.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.801
Does it say how you can get un-fucked?

07:23.680 --> 07:26.331
'Cause I'd like to be un-fucked by you, huh?

07:26.400 --> 07:28.084
Can you tell me when you get to that chapter?

07:30.840 --> 07:33.411
One day. One day, huh?

07:33.480 --> 07:36.370
Couldn't keep it together for one day.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.129
My daughter's Bat Mitzvah.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.001
You passed sorry a month ago.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.482
We're in the donating an organ
phase of contrition.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.289
You're not the only one going through things.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.204
Right, well, at least
we share a common enemy.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.327
Okay, you know what?

07:56.400 --> 07:58.801
Who the fuck are you, Oliver Twist?

07:58.880 --> 08:01.724
I mean, between the fucking whining
about the money...

08:01.800 --> 08:05.964
Oh, yeah, yeah, because my kids
and the whole, "We want to eat, Dad."

08:06.040 --> 08:07.929
- They're such assholes.
- Bullshit!

08:08.000 --> 08:11.209
How much you drop on that party, huh?
Thirty grand? Fifty?

08:11.280 --> 08:12.964
How much flake did you snort last week, huh?

08:13.040 --> 08:14.246
I'm off the shit, okay?

08:14.320 --> 08:16.129
Right, right. Well, what time is it?

08:16.680 --> 08:20.162
This, Zak, this is how
people get their noses broken.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.891
I'm just putting it out there in the universe.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.450
You sucker-punched me.

08:25.720 --> 08:26.926
Which, by the way, that should be

08:27.000 --> 08:29.082
the title of my memoir
about working with you.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.640
You want to bust my scrote,
Why'd you come on this trip?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.768
Because you're an infant, Richie.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.683
I'd trust my wife naked in bed
with Burt Reynolds

08:36.760 --> 08:38.967
before I'd trust you with 100 grand in cash.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.328
I partly see your point.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.370
You were in rare form that night.

08:55.440 --> 08:56.930
You don't even fucking remember.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.161
I...

08:59.480 --> 09:02.802
I have a vague recollection of
you screaming at me.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.370
It’s just, uh...

09:10.360 --> 09:11.725
You hurt me, Richie.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.407
Gets old.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.605
It's coke bullshit.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.967

09:36.320 --> 09:37.367
More.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.727

09:42.120 --> 09:43.167
Yeah.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.486
You sure?

09:49.120 --> 09:50.167
Yeah.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.650
Hey, listen, uh, wasn't gonna say anything.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.131
But I get the feeling you will.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.000
Maury Gold, hmm? And Corrado Galasso...

10:05.080 --> 10:06.844
- Nah.
-...coming into the office.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.769
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.446
Galasso's niece is a big fan of the J-5,

10:11.520 --> 10:14.251
so I got her and the friends
backstage passes.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.970
Maury brought him by.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.485

10:18.400 --> 10:19.890
(CHUCKLES) Okay, yeah.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.884
- Godfather bullshit.
- No, I figured something like that.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.564
I just...

10:29.280 --> 10:31.567
There was a singer at the party.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.886
This kid, I'm telling you.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.245
Like Bowie.

10:37.320 --> 10:41.166
Yeah, he did a Bowie song.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.487
Had a moody vibe.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.164
Just different. Better.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.167
Better.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.961
I mean, I'm just thinking about bring him in,

10:52.040 --> 10:53.883
just make a demo.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.371
You should.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.123
You always wanted to try A&R.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.445
Maybe. I don't know.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.761
(CHUCKLES)

11:10.160 --> 11:12.481
She'll be back. Devon.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.363
The silence in the morning.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.326
- The kids.
- Yeah.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.481
Yeah.

'Cause I can't get the bitch to leave.

-(LAUGHING)
- No matter what I do.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.324
Libations!

11:41.400 --> 11:44.961
Yeah, darling, give me another one, please.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.883
A threesome here? Right here? Jim Morrison?

11:46.960 --> 11:47.961
Right here.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.280
- Never had one.
- Really?

11:49.360 --> 11:51.328
No, I wouldn't know what goes where,

11:51.400 --> 11:52.686
who does what.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.931
I come so fast. Why disappoint two women?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.001

12:31.600 --> 12:32.647
Sit.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.204
I think your mom's just worried

12:35.280 --> 12:38.443
that the music company
isn't an appropriate place.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.000
- You're so young.
- And so trashy.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.610
Go ahead and say it.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.808
"For this I survived the Nazis?"

12:45.880 --> 12:47.450
She doesn't want you here.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.001
I didn't say that.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.884
I will give you enough
for your own apartment.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.166
You can continue to work.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.764
If you won't take the business, I can sell.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.121
You find a job in a place with good people,

13:00.200 --> 13:01.406
with the right kind of business.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.164
This is exactly the business I want.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.080
(SPEAKING POLISH)

13:08.400 --> 13:10.289
She's gonna bribe you
to put me on the street.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.203
She thinks you'll jump at it.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.805
That's not very nice.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.723
I would like you now to stay out of it.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.246
My brother always made excuses for you

13:18.320 --> 13:21.051
and I understand you've been through
some unpleasant things,

13:21.120 --> 13:24.727
but I have never been anything but polite.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.046
I don't want your money.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.571
You have no idea what you're doing.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.210
I guess we'll see.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.011
ANNOUNCER: (ON RADIO) Frankie Crocker!
FRANKIE: (ON RADIO) Hello, New York.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.366
<i>Here's a song guaranteed to put...</i>

13:35.440 --> 13:37.010

13:37.280 --> 13:39.169

- He totally backed up.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.366
Watch this.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.488
Whoa, Woolworth makes sports coats now?

13:42.560 --> 13:44.562
-(LAUGHING)
- Oh, you hear that?

13:44.640 --> 13:48.042
- You hear that?
- Oh, there it is. Turn it up. Turn it up.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.281
-(MUSIC PLAYING)
- Whoo!

13:50.400 --> 13:51.686
Whoo!

13:52.160 --> 13:55.164
I saw these guys at the Academy
a few months back.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.208
Ooh, you know what?
I actually saw these guys

13:57.280 --> 14:00.363
at the Academy a few months back
and they were fantastic.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.249
But you don't know nothing about this.
You ready?

14:02.360 --> 14:04.362
- There you go.
- Get him. Get him, Jorge.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.522
- In your face.
-(WHOOPING)

14:06.600 --> 14:08.125
Don't hurt him!

14:08.240 --> 14:09.526
- Don't hurt him.
- What you got?

14:09.600 --> 14:12.922
- That's what I'm talking about, baby.
- Get funky.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.684
- Oh, this motherfucker.
-(LAUGHING)

14:14.760 --> 14:15.761
Shit.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.250
(LAUGHING)

14:20.400 --> 14:22.562
Oh, now, screw me.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.246
Oh! Ooh, you ain't gonna get it.

14:25.320 --> 14:26.321
(LAUGHING)

14:27.600 --> 14:29.728
Uh-uh, no. No, no, no. That's my seat.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.801
All right.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.762
Don't even think about it, honky-tonk.
That's my seat, baby.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.607
Come on, man.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.121
- That's Hector's seat.
- Hector was let go.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.571
That's right.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.610
- What the fuck did I just say?
- I'm just supposed to stand?

14:53.680 --> 14:55.409
At least you got a job to stand at, right?

14:55.480 --> 14:57.608
Fucking Hector's standing on line
down at unemployment.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.641
(LAUGHING)

15:06.440 --> 15:08.568
Seriously, though, we need to
check them out at the Academy.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.041
(MOCKINGLY) Oh, I can't wait to check
them out at the Academy, yes.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.406
(LAUGHING)

15:13.680 --> 15:16.251
All right, gentlemen, get back to work, please.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.685
We got deadlines and shit.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.161
(MUSIC PLAYING)

15:27.800 --> 15:30.690
<i>Got on board a westbound...</i>

15:30.760 --> 15:32.444
ZAK: Okay, nice. All here.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.682
No Confederate money.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.286
Lou, she's all yours.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.249
Thank you, gentlemen.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.249
She's a beauty.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.448
A Venus with wings.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.443
Title's in the glove box.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.284
Hey, guys, I'm gonna take great care of her.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.170
Clean her up, air her out.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.890
She'll be like new, huh?

15:56.760 --> 15:58.285
Hey, Richie. Uh...

15:58.360 --> 16:00.522
You still got the bronze shag in the cabin?

16:00.600 --> 16:03.126
Up to your ankles. You walk around barefoot,

16:03.200 --> 16:04.770
feels like you're walking on a cloud.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.491
I remember when I hitched a ride back
from Monterey.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.324
Times change, huh?

16:09.400 --> 16:11.084
My wife picked out that color.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.162
I think I'm gonna go with alpaca.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.164
My lady's a colorist.
She did David Carradine's bungalow.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.163
Tangerine.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.201
Mykonos blue. What do you think?

16:24.240 --> 16:25.651
Blend in with the sky, right?

16:25.720 --> 16:28.121
Harder a plane is to see,
the harder it is to shoot down.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.645
Are you flying over Da Nang?

16:29.720 --> 16:32.326
I can't keep up. Detroit, Boston, Ontario.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.811
And that was just last weekend.

16:33.880 --> 16:37.407
Having three albums in the Top 10
is like juggling cats.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.529
But the work, right? Keeps us hungry.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.242
You're gonna bounce back.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.369
A few more years,
I'll be buying a 747 off of you.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.728
- ACR is doing fine.
- Hey, I'm having a thing at my Malibu place.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.643
Good people. Mellow vibe.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.609
I got to stop into town for a quick meeting,

16:55.680 --> 16:57.682
but you should swing by.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.080
(SIGHS)

17:04.520 --> 17:05.851
What do you want to do?

17:05.960 --> 17:08.122
- Take a shit in the cockpit.
-(CHUCKLES)

17:09.359 --> 17:11.601
It's seven hours till our flight.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.250
It's like Bataan out here.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.202
Let's go. Go to the airport.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.328
Kill some time at the Clipper Club.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.209
That prick is gonna spread the word
that ACR is done.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.884
Eh, what are you gonna do?

17:28.319 --> 17:30.288
Steal half his roster.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.801

18:14.080 --> 18:15.286

18:15.360 --> 18:17.442
- Richie, how are you?
- Nice place.

18:17.520 --> 18:18.806
- Thanks.
- Beautiful.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.450
Aw, thank you.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.250
Oh, Stu. You all right? Good.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.646
ZAK: There he is. Find out.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.961
- Hey.
- Hey, Richie. You know Gram Parsons?

18:32.040 --> 18:34.327
- Only on wax. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, man.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.562
- Captain Many Hands. Give it to me.
- Oh, man.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.449
- Skin.
- Nobody calls me that anymore.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.170
Hey, Manassas, I dug it.

18:40.240 --> 18:41.924
- Oh, you were the one.
-(CHUCKLES) Come on.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.843
Yeah, what happened?
Who'd you piss off at <i>Rolling</i> Stone?

18:43.920 --> 18:45.763
<i>Hey, fuck Rolling Stone,</i> okay?

18:45.840 --> 18:47.842
What, they throw David Cassidy
on the goddamn cover?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.922
- What is that?
- How you guys doing?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.729
- We're good. Great, actually.
- Yeah?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.370
When's the last time you were in New York?

18:53.440 --> 18:54.726
It's fucking electric right now.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.644
Here, too, man. Can you even believe this?

18:58.680 --> 18:59.920
Yeah, no, out of sight.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.206
Hey, YOU happy?

19:02.320 --> 19:03.560
Yeah, man.

19:03.640 --> 19:06.325
No, man, are you happy?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.962
Can make some real music, you and me.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.490
I heard you guys were getting out.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.483
- What? No.
- What? No. Come on.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.483
No, PolyGram came begging us to sell.

- Here.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.166
Some pineapple.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.409
Makes your cum taste sweet.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.361
Boy, pheasant just lands
on your shotgun, doesn't it?

19:37.320 --> 19:38.924
Hey, you been to Joshua Tree?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.571
Uh, no, I'm good. I haven't, no.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.244
Me and my old lady
are heading out tomorrow.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.004
Nice. I hear the sunsets are amazing.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.408
Sunrise, man.
Cap Rock where the desert meets the sky.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.609
It's like you're born into a new world.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.682
Some peyote, a few buttons,

19:53.760 --> 19:55.728
that ball comes up,

19:55.840 --> 19:58.207
mild silver and furious gold.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.805
It's delicious, man.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.004
You could find it again.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.331
Find what, man?

20:05.240 --> 20:08.369
Like... That thing of beauty

20:08.440 --> 20:11.250
maybe you lost or let go.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.005
It's still out there.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.006
That's the trip.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.563
Getting that back

20:17.640 --> 20:19.961
or letting it go for good.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.966
WOMAN: Hey, Stephen.
STEPHEN: Cass.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.805
Yeah, right.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.440
STEPHEN: Hey, pretty lady.
It's good to see you.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.760
Saw you on Carson.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.569
This whole city is a fucking mortuary

20:33.640 --> 20:35.563
with an ocean view.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.689
Come on, let's... We'll make the 4:00.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.524
What, and let Meshejian piss all over us?

20:40.600 --> 20:42.762
No, we stay. We work the room

20:42.840 --> 20:45.127
and remind these freaks we're still a force.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.801
(SIGHS) All right, well, I'm starving.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.523

I'm good, Lou, thanks.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.488
There is no certainty in this world.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.925
Of only this can we be certain.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.804
Yeah, well, times change.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.121
Although maybe not here.
Let me ask you something.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.123
Is that fucking Micky Dolenz?

21:19.200 --> 21:22.443
You see the film Head? He's good people.

21:22.520 --> 21:25.000
Yeah, créme de la.

Hey, look, it's Fabian.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.445
You're a trip, Richie.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.729
Never leave New York. The anger suits you.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.970
Check it, Richie.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.929
I see David.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.685
And I see Stephen.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.642
And I see Neil.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.802
Hey, Neil! One minute.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.689
RICHIE: What, reunion?

21:47.760 --> 21:50.570
Good luck with that.
People get divorced for a reason.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.688
They mingle, they pass the peace pipe.

21:52.760 --> 21:56.845
I do a Kissinger and it's Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young this spring.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.530
I hear recycling's big out here.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.170
Easier than making something new.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.641
I just laid down a track
called Hooked On a Feeling

22:04.760 --> 22:06.410
by this out of sight Swedish group.

22:06.480 --> 22:09.086
<i>Hooked On a Feeling?

- Okay.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.085
What about ACR? You dropping anything?

22:14.160 --> 22:16.845
Yeah, I'm laying down
a killer track in New York right now.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.524
What's it called?

22:18.600 --> 22:19.681
"Fuck the Rush."

Out of sight!

44:05.160 --> 44:06.810
Listen, look.

44:07.600 --> 44:10.171
I'm not gonna try to sell you on anything

44:10.240 --> 44:12.766

That's the band.

44:47.080 --> 44:49.367
Yeah, we made a racket, boy.
