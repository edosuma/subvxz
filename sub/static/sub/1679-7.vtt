WEBVTT

00:10.106 --> 00:12.258
- So, I guess that decides it.
- Yup.

00:12.268 --> 00:13.704
Hanging out at a coffee place

00:13.714 --> 00:16.447
is not nearly as much fun
as hanging out at a bar.

00:18.414 --> 00:19.872
Man, what's that?

00:20.191 --> 00:21.382
What?

00:21.527 --> 00:25.260
That cute coffee girl
wrote a heart by your name.

00:25.270 --> 00:27.825
Somebody has a crush on you.

00:27.835 --> 00:30.804
Somebody thinks you're me.

00:31.425 --> 00:33.451
Do you really
think she likes me?

00:33.586 --> 00:35.340
I mean, I guess 
it's not that surprising.

00:35.353 --> 00:38.071
Every time I come in here,
I totally crack her up.

00:38.087 --> 00:40.093
Marshall, here's
your pumpkin latte.

00:40.109 --> 00:44.262
Wow. How did you fit a
pumpkin in this little cup?

00:45.709 --> 00:47.563
I'll have a pumpkin latte.

00:47.585 --> 00:50.023
How do they even fit a
pumpkin in those little cups?

00:50.038 --> 00:51.990
What? You got a shrink
ray back there?

00:52.826 --> 00:53.813
Yeah.

00:54.436 --> 00:56.863
Hey, remember that
time I said that thing

00:56.877 --> 00:59.731
about how do they fit a
pumpkin into that little cup?

00:59.745 --> 01:01.531
- Which time?
- The first time.

01:01.547 --> 01:04.491
Yeah. That was really funny.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.591
Right.

01:05.605 --> 01:07.531
All right, there's only two
reasons she'd laugh at that.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.971
One, it's the first
joke she's ever heard,

01:09.987 --> 01:12.911
or two, she likes you.
You should totally ask her out.

01:12.927 --> 01:13.521
You think?

01:13.537 --> 01:15.032
Yeah, that why you're not
back with Lily, right?

01:15.067 --> 01:17.511
So you can experience what
it's like to be single.

01:18.366 --> 01:19.990
Well, what if the heart
doesn't mean anything?

01:20.025 --> 01:22.001
What if she writes
it on all the cups?

01:22.016 --> 01:24.061
Mine says "Ted," no heart.

01:24.088 --> 01:27.091
Mine says... "Swarley."

01:27.958 --> 01:30.090
How'd they get
"Swarley" from "Barney"?

01:30.105 --> 01:31.193
It's not even a name.

01:31.206 --> 01:33.300
Who would ever be
called "Swarley"?

01:35.306 --> 01:38.242
Oh, please don't start
calling me "Swarley."

01:40.215 --> 01:42.661
This would never
happen at a bar!

01:44.556 --> 01:46.731
Man! What's up with Swarley?

01:46.747 --> 01:49.633
I know. You almost never see
old Swarlz get that upset.

02:06.257 --> 02:07.800
Hey, guess what?

02:07.818 --> 02:08.741
Oh, sorry.

02:08.757 --> 02:09.780
It's only my mom.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.931
She's just rambling
on like always.

02:12.428 --> 02:13.700
What happened?

02:13.716 --> 02:15.081
Marshall asked out a girl.

02:15.097 --> 02:16.101
Wow.

02:16.118 --> 02:18.100
Well, if anything,
that's Dad's fault.

02:18.115 --> 02:20.083
That'll keep her going a while.

02:20.095 --> 02:22.541
Oh, of course, you know,
he had a little help.

02:22.557 --> 02:23.631
Swarley hooked him up?

02:23.648 --> 02:24.732
Oh, good. You got my text.

02:24.747 --> 02:26.410
- Yeah.
- Oh. No, it was me.

02:26.427 --> 02:28.342
I gave Marshall
one of my secrets.

02:29.095 --> 02:31.142
- So, what she say?
- Nothing.

02:31.975 --> 02:34.831
I don't think she heard me.
It's pretty busy up there.

02:34.847 --> 02:36.631
What? You gave her
the look right?

02:36.646 --> 02:38.570
Head down, eyes looking up,

02:38.588 --> 02:40.710
hands in pockets, shoulders up,

02:40.727 --> 02:43.640
head slightly tilted,
conveying shy vulnerability.

02:44.288 --> 02:45.952
I think so.

02:51.916 --> 02:53.503
Look, can we just go?

02:53.985 --> 02:56.212
Pumpkin latte for Marshall.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.391
I didn't order that.

03:05.775 --> 03:08.112
Phone number.

03:09.045 --> 03:10.411
I love that look.

03:10.427 --> 03:13.130
I think I slept with you
because of that look.

03:13.146 --> 03:14.263
And it's fake?

03:14.278 --> 03:16.792
Oh, and you biting your lower lip,
shyly looking away

03:16.808 --> 03:19.331
and thrusting your
chest out is natural?

03:19.348 --> 03:21.012
Yeah, I hear you.

03:22.146 --> 03:23.720
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.

03:23.935 --> 03:25.742
Are you free tomorrow night?

03:25.757 --> 03:27.830
I was thinking of having
a wine tasting slash

03:27.848 --> 03:30.291
"help me catch the rat
in my apartment" party.

03:30.306 --> 03:32.990
That's a great idea.
You can put out cheese for both.

03:34.037 --> 03:35.883
I should invite
Marshall, right?

03:35.898 --> 03:37.222
It'd be weird if I didn't.

03:37.238 --> 03:39.290
Yeah, I don't think he can go.

03:39.317 --> 03:40.902
Really?  Why not?

03:40.917 --> 03:43.240
Uh, okay, um...

03:43.295 --> 03:45.480
Lily, we have to
tell you something.

03:45.496 --> 03:47.360
Marshall has a date.

03:48.007 --> 03:50.783
Oh. Well... good for him.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.140
Really? You're okay with it?

03:52.158 --> 03:54.090
Look, we've been broken
up almost six months.

03:54.105 --> 03:56.332
I mean,
I'm not thrilled about the idea,

03:56.345 --> 03:59.492
but he has every right
to date someone else.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.453
That's very mature.

04:01.465 --> 04:03.122
Why are you holding the phone?

04:03.136 --> 04:04.842
Oh, shoot.

04:06.026 --> 04:08.690
That's hilarious, Mom.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.833
Didn't even notice.

04:12.365 --> 04:15.021
Hey, dude, by the way,
I really like that suit.

04:15.036 --> 04:17.223
Tell me about the fabric.
Is it foreign or something?

04:17.236 --> 04:20.163
Wow. It is foreign.
I'm impressed, Ted.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.620
- It's Moroccan, actually.
- Whoa.

04:21.635 --> 04:24.131
I got a call for Swarley.

04:24.147 --> 04:26.281
Is there a Swarley here?

04:26.298 --> 04:28.342
You weren't interested in
my suit at all, were you?

04:28.355 --> 04:30.511
- Hmm?
- Swarley!

04:31.848 --> 04:34.842
Yeah, I know he's there.
It's really important.

04:34.856 --> 04:36.352
Could you ask again?

04:36.367 --> 04:38.443
Important call for Swarley!

04:38.458 --> 04:40.912
Geez, can't you hear him, Swarley?
There's a call for you.

04:40.927 --> 04:43.411
Stop calling me that.

04:43.425 --> 04:45.962
Uh... Hey, I'd like you guys
to officially meet Chloe.

04:45.977 --> 04:46.960
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:46.978 --> 04:47.862
Hi.

04:47.876 --> 04:49.393
It's nice to meet you guys.

04:49.408 --> 04:51.712
- I'll be right back.
- It's right back there.

04:55.915 --> 04:58.383
Right? Right? She's hot!

04:58.397 --> 04:59.860
And she likes me?

04:59.875 --> 05:03.163
She likes Italian food.
I also like Italian food.

05:03.176 --> 05:06.593
She likes Billy Joel.
I also like... music.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.553
And I think we're
going to go out again.

05:09.567 --> 05:12.132
- Dude, you gotta ditch her.
- Obviously.

05:12.596 --> 05:13.522
Why?

05:13.537 --> 05:14.832
She's got the crazy eyes.

05:14.845 --> 05:16.790
Dude. The eyes.

05:16.806 --> 05:18.492
They're crazy.

05:18.507 --> 05:20.500
What are you guys talking about,
the crazy eyes?

05:20.515 --> 05:24.582
It's a well-documented condition
of the pupils, or pupi.

05:24.598 --> 05:25.862
No. Just pupils.

05:25.877 --> 05:29.343
It's an indicator of
future mental instability.

05:29.358 --> 05:32.102
She does not have
the crazy eyes.

05:32.117 --> 05:33.821
You just can't see it
because you're afflicted

05:33.857 --> 05:36.733
with  "haven't been laid
in a while" blindness.

05:36.746 --> 05:38.603
She was too far away
in the coffee place,

05:38.615 --> 05:41.522
but when I saw her
up close just now...

05:41.537 --> 05:43.523
Hey, I'd like you guys to
officially meet Chloe.

05:43.537 --> 05:44.623
-  Hi.
- Hi.

05:44.635 --> 05:45.583
Hi.

05:45.597 --> 05:47.363
It's nice to meet you guys.

05:52.765 --> 05:54.553
You guys,
I'm not going to stop dating Chloe

05:54.566 --> 05:57.041
just because you think
she has the crazy eyes.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.102
You can keep going out with her,
but you're gonna regret it.

05:59.135 --> 06:01.563
One time,
I met a girl at this very bar.

06:01.578 --> 06:04.650
I saw that she had
the crazy eyes...

06:06.557 --> 06:07.830
...but I ignored it.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.181
And then, sure enough.

06:10.846 --> 06:12.920
Barney, can I ask
you a question?

06:12.935 --> 06:14.411
Anything.

06:14.766 --> 06:17.430
Would you like to
have a threesome?

06:17.773 --> 06:19.081
Of course.

06:19.097 --> 06:21.853
Great. It'll be you,
me and Mr. Weasels.

06:24.099 --> 06:25.702
So, did you do it?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.211
No. It ended up
being just a twosome

06:28.225 --> 06:30.580
with the third one
watching from a chair.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.622
Which one were you?

06:33.447 --> 06:35.202
I'd rather not say.

06:35.516 --> 06:38.062
Look, there was a time I didn't
believe in the crazy eyes either,

06:38.096 --> 06:40.012
and then I met Jeanine.

06:40.078 --> 06:42.771
She had serious crazy eyes.

06:43.228 --> 06:46.660
I told myself I was 
just imagining it, but then...

06:46.675 --> 06:48.440
So, should we go get a drink?

06:48.458 --> 06:50.860
As long as it's in
your apartment.

06:52.125 --> 06:53.183
Whoa, I'm sorry.

06:53.195 --> 06:58.103
Watch! Where! You're! Going!

06:59.998 --> 07:02.190
So, where do you live?

07:03.026 --> 07:05.832
You guys, Chloe is not 
gonna do any of that stuff.

07:05.848 --> 07:07.642
She's a nice girl
from Nebraska.

07:07.658 --> 07:08.852
She's not crazy.

07:08.866 --> 07:11.022
She's... she's awesome.

07:11.036 --> 07:13.242
But you can't avoid
the crazy eyes forever.

07:13.255 --> 07:16.180
Sooner or later, the crazy 
comes bubbling to the surface.

07:16.197 --> 07:16.982
Hello?

07:16.998 --> 07:18.622
Marshall, it's Chloe.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.232
Are you the one who's
called me like nine times?

07:21.248 --> 07:23.342
Yeah. Could you come get me?

07:23.355 --> 07:25.803
I'm in the middle
of taking a test.

07:25.818 --> 07:27.770
Please. I'm so scared.

07:28.017 --> 07:29.433
Well, what's going on?

07:29.448 --> 07:31.462
This weird midget guy
started following me

07:31.485 --> 07:32.653
and he was screaming at me

07:32.668 --> 07:34.890
and he had a limp and
a big hump on his back

07:34.908 --> 07:36.302
and the police
didn't believe me

07:36.315 --> 07:39.150
and I almost got trampled
by a horse and...

07:39.168 --> 07:42.040
God I must sound totally
crazy to you right now.

07:42.655 --> 07:45.010
No. Pfft.

07:45.027 --> 07:46.302
Not at all.

07:46.927 --> 07:48.652
So, she's needy crazy.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.440
That's one of the worst kinds.

07:50.457 --> 07:51.761
I've had one of those.

07:51.777 --> 07:53.462
Makes up stories
to get attention.

07:53.475 --> 07:56.662
Went out with her for three weeks--
her dad died twice.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.510
Guys, she was really
freaked out, okay?

07:59.528 --> 08:01.081
Maybe the story is true.

08:01.096 --> 08:03.833
What in the world would make
you believe that's a true story?

08:03.847 --> 08:06.373
She's really hot.

08:06.445 --> 08:08.690
They always are.

08:09.965 --> 08:11.603
- You all done with that, Ted?
- Yeah.

08:11.617 --> 08:14.313
Ned. I told you
to call him Ned.

08:14.466 --> 08:16.322
That's just sad.

08:16.335 --> 08:18.103
Sorry, Swarley.

08:19.357 --> 08:21.833
So, do just you
and Ted live here

08:21.848 --> 08:23.613
or does Swarley live here, too?

08:23.627 --> 08:26.551
Nah. Swarley has his own place.

08:29.918 --> 08:30.943
What was that?

08:30.955 --> 08:32.673
Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.

08:34.835 --> 08:36.561
So, here you go.

08:36.576 --> 08:39.011
Two pumpkin beers.

08:39.168 --> 08:41.880
I was joking.
They're regular beers.

08:44.738 --> 08:46.402
What is that?

08:53.308 --> 08:55.190
This picture is broken.

08:55.206 --> 08:58.100
Oh. That's too bad.

08:58.117 --> 08:59.922
Is that Lily?

08:59.938 --> 09:02.222
Is that the girl you
were going to marry?

09:02.238 --> 09:04.392
Yeah.  Is that what
that sound was?

09:04.408 --> 09:06.633
Did you just smash this?

09:06.645 --> 09:07.930
No.

09:07.946 --> 09:10.222
Why would I do that?

09:11.237 --> 09:13.561
Let me look into your eyes.

09:14.076 --> 09:15.732
Okay.

09:18.708 --> 09:21.300
I had a really
nice time tonight.

09:21.315 --> 09:23.592
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.

09:23.928 --> 09:27.372
I like your eyes a lot, too.

09:29.376 --> 09:30.640
Stop!

09:34.208 --> 09:36.891
Hi. I'm Lily.

09:40.178 --> 09:42.122
Stop!

09:42.136 --> 09:44.220
Now, kids,
I know Lily hiding in the apartment

09:44.235 --> 09:47.520
while Marshall was on a date with
another girl seems pretty crazy,

09:47.538 --> 09:49.880
but when you hear her
side of the story,

09:49.897 --> 09:51.950
well, it's still pretty crazy.

09:52.627 --> 09:54.180
What's up Swarlz?

09:54.196 --> 09:56.402
No. Okay? No. No more.

09:56.418 --> 09:58.473
I will not let this 
become a thing. It's over.

09:58.487 --> 10:00.450
No more Swarley. No Swarlz.

10:00.466 --> 10:02.942
No more Swar-lay.

10:02.957 --> 10:05.920
No more Swar...
wait for it... ley.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.510
No more Bob Swarley, mon.

10:08.526 --> 10:11.471
No more. No! It's over.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.061
Do you understand?

10:13.078 --> 10:13.903
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.413
Thank you.

10:18.135 --> 10:19.003
Nice.

10:19.017 --> 10:21.191
- Why didn't you call me?
- Was I supposed to call you?

10:21.207 --> 10:24.460
Yes, about the whole Marshall-
dating-another-girl thing.

10:24.477 --> 10:25.590
You said you were fine with it.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.623
Yeah, in front of Ted,
but then I shot you a look.

10:28.638 --> 10:30.972
- What look?
- This.

10:32.808 --> 10:34.511
That doesn't seem like a look.

10:34.526 --> 10:37.103
Yes it is. It means, 
"I'm upset call me later."

10:37.115 --> 10:39.382
You should have pulled me aside
and told me what the look meant.

10:39.417 --> 10:41.262
If I pulled you aside,
I wouldn't need the look.

10:41.297 --> 10:42.523
Well, maybe if it was a
more distinctive look...

10:42.556 --> 10:44.390
Okay, the look isn't important.

10:44.405 --> 10:47.472
What's important is that
I can't stand the idea

10:47.486 --> 10:49.222
of Marshall dating
another woman.

10:49.238 --> 10:51.703
I mean, what if 
he falls in love with her?

10:51.715 --> 10:53.490
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

10:53.508 --> 10:56.051
Ted says she has
the crazy eyes.

10:56.065 --> 10:56.781
What's that?

10:56.795 --> 10:59.171
Apparently, a thing women
have that guys can see

10:59.186 --> 11:01.062
and it tells them that
the girl's crazy.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.753
Oh, kind of like how you
never want to date a guy

11:03.768 --> 11:05.120
with perfect fingernails?

11:05.135 --> 11:07.002
Jerk nails. Exactly.

11:07.016 --> 11:10.332
Well, did-did Ted say
whether she was good-looking?

11:10.348 --> 11:11.912
I mean,
'cause if I knew she was ugly,

11:11.928 --> 11:14.022
then maybe I wouldn't
be so freaked out.

11:14.037 --> 11:16.293
Uh, he didn't say,
but you can find out.

11:16.306 --> 11:19.811
I think her name is Chloe--
she works at Cosa Coffee on 78th.

11:19.828 --> 11:23.241
Phone call for Swarles Barkley?

11:24.867 --> 11:26.800
Hey, Ted. No, he's not here.

11:26.817 --> 11:29.033
Good one, though--
remember that one.

11:34.648 --> 11:36.620
Is, um, Chloe here?

11:36.637 --> 11:38.853
She just left.
You can probably still catch her.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.642
She's easy to spot--
she's got a pink umbrella.

11:41.655 --> 11:43.301
Oh, thanks, Brian.

11:43.318 --> 11:44.953
My name is Scott.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.731
Your tag says Brian.

11:46.746 --> 11:48.233
I know. Funny story.

11:48.246 --> 11:49.662
So,  I wake up this
morning, and...

11:49.677 --> 11:51.673
Yeah, see you later, Brian.

12:01.136 --> 12:02.701
There she is.

12:02.717 --> 12:04.633
She doesn't look that great.

12:04.646 --> 12:07.020
She's not fat,
but that doesn't mean anything.

12:07.038 --> 12:09.530
I know tons of skinny,
ugly women.

12:09.545 --> 12:12.181
That's right,
snotty girl in my yoga class,

12:12.195 --> 12:14.442
I'm talking to you.

12:14.455 --> 12:18.051
Come on, Chloe, turn around.

12:18.396 --> 12:20.843
Here we go. Turn around, Chloe.

12:20.856 --> 12:24.582
Come on,
show me that hideous face.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.473
Damn it!

12:26.535 --> 12:28.941
Ooh, I know,
I'll get ahead of her,

12:28.955 --> 12:31.371
then I'll cut back so I... Aah!

12:31.385 --> 12:34.083
Oh, my God, that hurts!

12:34.326 --> 12:37.233
Turn around! Come on!

12:37.246 --> 12:39.141
Just turn around!

12:39.156 --> 12:41.530
Okay, this is ridiculous.

12:41.547 --> 12:43.280
Hey!

12:45.855 --> 12:48.521
Turn around!
What's the matter with you?

12:48.545 --> 12:50.611
Hey, you!

12:52.055 --> 12:53.960
Turn around!

12:55.515 --> 12:58.162
Turn around, Chloe!

13:03.976 --> 13:06.512
She's hot? I'm so sorry.

13:06.526 --> 13:07.902
No, it's fine.

13:07.918 --> 13:09.713
I-It just makes things easier.

13:09.727 --> 13:11.393
Now that I know she's a threat,

13:11.408 --> 13:14.463
all I have to do is keep Marshall
from ever seeing her again.

13:14.478 --> 13:16.763
Okay, I have two plans--
you can help me choose.

13:16.778 --> 13:17.930
Plan A--

13:17.945 --> 13:20.751
remember that time Marshall
and I had sex in the bathroom?

13:20.768 --> 13:22.731
Oops, I got knocked up.

13:22.746 --> 13:24.871
- Lily.
- Okay, plan B

13:24.886 --> 13:27.193
is called "Chloe's Accident."

13:27.207 --> 13:28.681
- Just stop.
- What?

13:28.698 --> 13:31.002
Lily, you can't do
any of those things.

13:31.015 --> 13:32.770
If you two are ever
gonna get back together,

13:32.776 --> 13:35.632
you have to let him work
out whatever this is.

13:35.645 --> 13:38.001
I know. You're right.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.201
Now, come on,
Ted asked us to be upstairs at 6:00.

13:40.218 --> 13:42.230
Some surprise for Barney.

13:42.245 --> 13:44.232
- Barney?
- Uh, Swarley.

13:45.527 --> 13:47.863
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

13:47.877 --> 13:49.232
Where's Marshall?

13:49.247 --> 13:50.621
Oh, he's getting a haircut.

13:50.637 --> 13:52.830
Oh. For his date.

13:52.847 --> 13:54.391
Good for him.

13:54.405 --> 13:56.271
Hope he has a good
time tonight.

13:56.285 --> 13:58.151
Relax, you've got
nothing to worry about.

13:58.165 --> 13:59.601
The girl's crazy.

13:59.616 --> 14:01.151
Thanks!

14:01.168 --> 14:03.590
He'll just have wild monkey
sex with her five times, max,

14:03.606 --> 14:05.011
and be done with her.

14:05.027 --> 14:06.601
Thanks again.

14:08.466 --> 14:09.811
What are you doing?

14:09.826 --> 14:13.020
I just wanted to listen to
a little music, that's all.

14:13.036 --> 14:15.591
And this next one's
going out to Swarley.

14:15.608 --> 14:17.493
All your friends know
you miss Barney,

14:17.508 --> 14:20.051
but he's gone,
and you got to accept that, baby.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.942
And, Swarley, you're gonna be 
a better woman for it.

14:22.957 --> 14:26.030
Here's "I Am Woman"
by Helen Reddy.

14:26.047 --> 14:29.831
Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman.
I love it!

14:29.846 --> 14:32.630
You know, I was thinking about this
whole new name thing last night,

14:32.646 --> 14:34.852
and you know what I realized?
I like it.

14:34.867 --> 14:36.570
You like being called Swarley?

14:36.588 --> 14:38.422
Are you kidding?
I want you to call me that.

14:38.437 --> 14:39.710
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

14:39.746 --> 14:42.141
Do I think what's gonna work?
I'm just saying, I love my new name,

14:42.176 --> 14:45.480
so please only call
me that from now on.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.771
Call you what?

14:47.948 --> 14:52.160
You know, that-that-that new name
that you've been calling me.

14:52.178 --> 14:53.532
Say it.

14:53.546 --> 14:55.392
Why? You guys know what it is.

14:55.405 --> 14:57.083
Say the name.

14:57.996 --> 15:00.613
No, I don't want to! I hate it!

15:00.627 --> 15:03.091
I hate it! It's not funny!

15:03.107 --> 15:05.543
It's never been funny!
I've never done any...

15:05.556 --> 15:07.081
No!

15:07.735 --> 15:09.832
Man, he is really gonna lose it

15:09.845 --> 15:12.811
when all the magazine
subscriptions start coming in.

15:12.876 --> 15:15.423
I signed him up for
People in Espanol,

15:15.438 --> 15:18.220
but I addressed it to Swarlos.

15:18.236 --> 15:21.860
Hey, where's the picture of
Marshall and me at the pier?

15:21.876 --> 15:23.973
Didn't it used to
be by that window?

15:23.986 --> 15:27.483
Oh, yeah, he, uh,
he sort of took it down when you left.

15:27.498 --> 15:29.233
Put it behind some books,
I think.

15:29.245 --> 15:31.560
Oh, well-well,
maybe I should put it back up.

15:31.576 --> 15:33.620
Why, so Chloe'll see
it and get scared off?

15:33.637 --> 15:34.732
No.

15:34.745 --> 15:37.343
So Marshall'll see
it and feel guilty.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.293
Yeah, okay.

15:40.437 --> 15:42.472
But she wasn't okay.

15:42.487 --> 15:45.201
Later that night,
while Marshall was on his date,

15:45.215 --> 15:47.403
Lily came back.

16:04.087 --> 16:05.942
...anymore.

16:05.955 --> 16:07.653
Pretty impressive, huh?

16:07.667 --> 16:11.680
Wow, you really did memorize all the
lyrics to "We Didn't Start the Fire."

16:12.045 --> 16:13.850
Can I, uh,
can I get you a drink?

16:13.866 --> 16:15.280
I'd love a beer.

16:15.297 --> 16:16.991
You got it.

16:19.586 --> 16:22.191
Lily did what any
sensible woman would do.

16:22.205 --> 16:24.541
She hid under the desk.

16:25.015 --> 16:27.342
And she stayed there,
listening to her ex-fiance

16:27.357 --> 16:29.562
on a date with another woman.

16:29.715 --> 16:32.192
I had a really
nice time tonight.

16:32.205 --> 16:34.240
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.

16:34.257 --> 16:36.941
I like your eyes a lot, too.

16:36.957 --> 16:39.620
Finally, much like Billy Joel,

16:39.635 --> 16:41.331
she couldn't take it anymore.

16:41.346 --> 16:43.150
Stop!

16:45.376 --> 16:48.090
Hi. I'm Lily.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.760
Lily... Lily,
what the hell are you doing?

16:52.777 --> 16:56.093
I don't know. I...
I don't know... what I'm doing.

16:56.107 --> 16:59.450
Oh, pumpkin beer--
that was a good one.

16:59.487 --> 17:02.862
I'm just... I'm gonna go.
I... I'm so sorry.

17:02.877 --> 17:05.901
En-Enjoy the rest of your date.

17:10.467 --> 17:12.881
She seems nice.

17:24.204 --> 17:27.391
- Lilly, what the hell...
- I'm sorry.

17:27.405 --> 17:29.543
I only snuck up
there because...

17:29.557 --> 17:32.282
when  I saw how cute she was yesterday,
I freaked out.

17:32.296 --> 17:34.643
Lily, you saw her yesterday?

17:34.825 --> 17:38.873
Yeah, I...
kind of chased her down the street.

17:41.887 --> 17:45.232
Wait, so you were the
hunchback with the limp?

17:45.246 --> 17:46.771
Yeah.

17:46.788 --> 17:50.182
And she didn't break the picture,
I did.

17:52.577 --> 17:55.621
So Chloe's not crazy, she's...

17:55.948 --> 17:59.290
just a nice, normal girl.

17:59.606 --> 18:02.173
Yeah, she is.

18:02.937 --> 18:06.381
And you deserve a nice,
normal girl.

18:07.007 --> 18:09.573
So, why don't you
just go back up there

18:09.586 --> 18:12.233
and-and finish your date.

18:13.956 --> 18:15.793
Yeah.

18:16.127 --> 18:17.253
Okay.

18:17.355 --> 18:19.163
Okay.

18:21.516 --> 18:25.063
Wait, if you were the hunchback,
then why did she think you were a guy?

18:26.498 --> 18:30.793
I-I might have used a voice
that sounded like this.

18:31.398 --> 18:32.871
- Why?
- Because I didn't want

18:32.887 --> 18:36.073
her to know it was me, which 
I now realize doesn't make sense,

18:36.088 --> 18:38.641
because she hadn't even met me.

18:38.856 --> 18:40.971
You're crazy.

18:42.525 --> 18:48.872
You have... crazier eyes than
anybody that I have ever met.

18:50.365 --> 18:51.921
Shouldn't you be
going back up...

18:51.937 --> 18:53.960
I mean,
you're out of your mind.

18:53.976 --> 18:58.203
You're... just
absolutely insane.

19:00.656 --> 19:04.533
Shouldn't you be
going back upstairs?

19:07.896 --> 19:10.650
I've missed you so much.

19:17.617 --> 19:19.791
Okay, I ran it by the group,

19:19.805 --> 19:21.220
and we decided we're
gonna give you a choice.

19:21.256 --> 19:23.771
We will agree to stop
calling you Swarley,

19:23.785 --> 19:27.292
but instead,
we'll call you Jennifer.

19:28.886 --> 19:30.403
Well?

19:30.416 --> 19:32.221
I'm thinking.

19:33.336 --> 19:36.632
How about this?
On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays...

19:36.647 --> 19:38.361
Hey.

19:38.375 --> 19:39.991
Look at this.

19:40.007 --> 19:41.933
So right there,
in the exact same place

19:41.946 --> 19:45.110
that six months earlier I had
walked up and found Marshall alone,

19:45.128 --> 19:48.860
crying over his breakup with Lily,
I found him again.

19:48.875 --> 19:51.192
Only this time he wasn't alone,

19:51.207 --> 19:53.030
and he was happy.

19:53.045 --> 19:56.281
So we went to the bar to celebrate,
and it was great.

19:56.296 --> 19:59.160
I was with Robin,
Marshall and Lily were back together,

19:59.176 --> 20:01.103
and Barney had a cool new name.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.472
All was right with the world...

20:03.485 --> 20:05.611
until we got back
to the apartment.

20:05.627 --> 20:07.750
Oh, my God.

20:08.038 --> 20:09.772
Hey, Chloe, I...

20:09.787 --> 20:11.711
guess I forgot I
left you up here.

20:11.727 --> 20:15.411
I was gonna leave,
but I can't find my keys.

20:16.505 --> 20:19.393
They're right there
on the coffee table.

20:21.108 --> 20:22.812
Silly me.

20:22.827 --> 20:25.800
I must have looked
everywhere else.

20:28.668 --> 20:31.820
Well... I'm just gonna go.

20:32.396 --> 20:34.872
Oh, I don't think we've met.
I'm Chloe.

20:34.888 --> 20:35.880
Robin.

20:35.897 --> 20:38.222
It's nice to meet you, Roland.

20:38.368 --> 20:40.440
I'll see you guys later.

20:43.178 --> 20:45.091
Roland?

20:45.806 --> 20:48.102
Your name's Roland.

20:48.628 --> 20:51.100
That's funny, right?

20:51.117 --> 20:53.382
Rock and Roland.

20:53.396 --> 20:57.112
Warsaw is the capital
of what? Roland.

20:57.548 --> 21:00.401
You're Monica Roland-ski.

21:01.696 --> 21:06.122
Hey, yeah,
that's just how I Roland.

21:06.425 --> 21:08.392
- Nice try, Swarley.
- Damn it.

21:16.837 --> 21:19.742
Swarley!

21:19.786 --> 21:22.062
# Sometimes you want to go #

21:22.076 --> 21:26.822
# Where everybody #
# knows your name #

21:27.136 --> 21:30.013
# And they're always #
# glad you came... #
