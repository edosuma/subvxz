WEBVTT

01:44.340 --> 01:45.540
Yeah.

01:46.809 --> 01:48.609
Pretty hard to breathe, huh?

01:50.979 --> 01:54.615
I mean, isn't there something
about the color white, like, uh..

01:54.617 --> 01:56.783
You know, like an art thing
or something?

01:56.785 --> 01:58.552
Oh, I forget.

01:58.554 --> 02:02.989
Like, uh, like it's the only color
you can't undo or something?

02:02.991 --> 02:06.026
Oh, man, I don't even know
why we have to fuckin' repaint

02:06.028 --> 02:07.494
this fuckin' thing
in the first place.

02:07.496 --> 02:08.862
I mean, it was already white.

02:08.864 --> 02:10.931
They're paying us, that's why.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.169
Stop fucking around, man.

02:16.171 --> 02:17.737
Now, I have to repaint
this shit.

02:17.739 --> 02:20.539
Alright, man, whatever.
Look, fix it.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.376
Why don't you get out
of here, huh?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.177
Get out of here, please,
I'll finish it.

02:26.179 --> 02:27.912
Fine, man.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.579
Lizard King.

05:01.748 --> 05:04.016
My heroes are dead.

05:04.018 --> 05:06.018
I was born in the wrong time.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.032
Fuckin' Lizard King.

05:20.034 --> 05:22.835
The same, the same, the same.

05:22.837 --> 05:24.970
The same.

05:24.972 --> 05:29.842
Fuckin' lamp is the same.

05:29.844 --> 05:33.445
Fuckin' TV, basketball, books.

05:33.447 --> 05:36.115
I don't hear. I don't see.

05:55.805 --> 05:58.940
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>
<i>I shouldn't have done that.</i>

06:03.277 --> 06:05.279
Gussy, Gussy, Gussy.

08:04.035 --> 08:06.703
<i>I miss the old New York</i>

08:06.705 --> 08:09.205
<i>in, like, the '70s and '80s.</i>

08:09.207 --> 08:12.976
<i>CBGBs. The Ramones.</i>
<i>"Mean Streets."</i>

08:12.978 --> 08:16.880
<i>SAMO doing graffiti</i>
<i>and Andy going to parties.</i>

08:16.882 --> 08:18.615
<i>The birth of hip-hop.</i>

08:18.617 --> 08:20.883
<i>Just look at Times Square.</i>

08:20.885 --> 08:22.752
<i>Used to be cool..</i>

08:22.754 --> 08:24.587
<i>All cracked up.</i>

08:24.589 --> 08:27.156
And now it's like
fuckin' Disneyland.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.893
What the fuck happened here?
Shit.

08:45.944 --> 08:47.678
That's a dope ride.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.814
I have nothing to lose, man.

08:50.816 --> 08:52.616
Alright, fuck it. Fuck it.

09:03.996 --> 09:06.157
Hey, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

09:45.907 --> 09:49.376
<i>The front doorman was there. I just
fuckin' jumped into the car, you know?</i>

09:49.378 --> 09:50.910
<i>But how did you start the car?</i>

09:50.912 --> 09:52.846
<i>The keys were in the car.</i>

09:52.848 --> 09:55.882
<i>Do you mean to tell me</i>
<i>this really happened?</i>

09:55.884 --> 09:57.216
<i>Pretty nice, huh?</i>

09:57.218 --> 09:59.219
Well, nice, in a sort of

09:59.221 --> 10:02.655
kind of
"Catcher In The Rye" way

10:02.657 --> 10:08.495
but... you didn't by any chance
bring the car here, did you?

10:08.497 --> 10:10.898
Yeah, it's parked
right outside. Come on.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.266
Come here.

10:12.268 --> 10:15.502
- There.
- Oh, you asshole!

10:15.504 --> 10:18.272
Did you forget
that I'm a fuckin' dope dealer?

10:18.274 --> 10:21.074
And I'm not the kind of person
who wants attention paid to him.

10:21.076 --> 10:22.743
Well, I mean,
you provide the community

10:22.745 --> 10:24.010
with a valuable services.

10:24.012 --> 10:26.979
Yes, I know and I adore you too

10:26.981 --> 10:28.514
but it's time to leave.

10:28.516 --> 10:29.915
<i>Are you kickin' me out?</i>

10:29.917 --> 10:33.017
<i>Yes, because anyway,</i>
<i>I don't think you can..</i>

10:34.620 --> 10:36.587
<i>There it is.</i>

10:38.423 --> 10:39.456
There you go.

10:39.458 --> 10:43.127
Prancy!
I don't count the money.

10:43.129 --> 10:46.964
You must have robbed
a lot of people to get that.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.143
<i>- Are you alright?</i>
- I'm okay.

11:01.145 --> 11:04.580
Look, if this is okay?

11:04.582 --> 11:07.416
Just, um, just give me a bindle

11:07.418 --> 11:09.652
<i>and we'll... call it even.</i>

11:09.654 --> 11:12.354
- How much?
<i>- A bindle.</i>

11:12.356 --> 11:16.391
A bindle. Uh, considering
that you owe me $3000...

11:16.393 --> 11:18.226
- 3 grand?
- Well, yes.

11:18.228 --> 11:20.061
- Oh, come on.
- <i> You owe me 600.</i>

11:20.063 --> 11:21.763
I gave you over 2 grand.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.164
<i>Come on...</i> - 2400.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.466
And that means
you owe me, uh, 600 more.

11:25.468 --> 11:28.636
- Juan, please.
- $600.

11:28.638 --> 11:30.971
Because I've been supporting
your habit for 4 months...

11:30.973 --> 11:34.041
Oh, Juan, come on! Juan.

11:34.043 --> 11:36.843
Please, look, I just need a
little bit of shit, that's all.

11:36.845 --> 11:39.813
- Think about the interest.
- You'll get it.

11:39.815 --> 11:42.048
Just a bit.

11:42.050 --> 11:46.486
Oh, well, Pranc. Prancy
honey, give him a balloon.

11:46.488 --> 11:48.254
Happy birthday.

11:48.256 --> 11:50.155
Thank you.

11:51.758 --> 11:53.958
Thanks, Prancy.
Don't call me Prancy.

11:55.260 --> 11:57.094
And now..

11:58.330 --> 12:00.064
It's time for you to leave.

12:08.238 --> 12:10.707
<i>Ah. That fuckin' kid.</i>

12:10.709 --> 12:13.109
It's more like
Catcher In The Rolls.

12:22.019 --> 12:24.620
Hey! Hey, Ruby!

12:57.821 --> 12:58.953
Hey, what's up?

13:00.622 --> 13:02.222
I'll take..

13:02.224 --> 13:03.924
You're gonna be like that, huh?

13:03.926 --> 13:05.558
Dissed.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.426
It's okay. It's okay.

13:07.428 --> 13:08.994
You know, I'm not like some

13:08.996 --> 13:11.130
crazy, psycho, weirdo
serial killer

13:11.132 --> 13:13.866
who hears voices or anything,
okay?

13:13.868 --> 13:15.568
- Good for you. It's good.
- Yeah, I..

13:15.570 --> 13:17.336
My voices only tell me
to hurt myself

13:17.338 --> 13:19.705
so... you're in the clear.

13:23.111 --> 13:25.377
I, I was staring at you
because, uh

13:25.379 --> 13:27.480
I think you're beautiful.

13:28.715 --> 13:30.949
Stunning, actually. I mean..

13:30.951 --> 13:32.550
Seriously, you're like
the fuckin' hottest thing

13:32.552 --> 13:34.319
I've ever fuckin' seen.

13:36.021 --> 13:38.255
Does this routine
work on everybody?

13:38.257 --> 13:39.790
I don't know,
I've never tried before.

13:39.792 --> 13:41.224
- Right.
- Yeah.

13:41.226 --> 13:43.292
And judging by your reaction,
I'll never say it again.

13:43.294 --> 13:44.660
I promise.

13:44.662 --> 13:47.930
Uh-oh, there it is.
You laughed.

13:47.932 --> 13:49.564
- I'm laughing at you.
- Doesn't matter.

13:49.566 --> 13:52.267
A laugh is a laugh.
Now you have to meet me.

13:53.603 --> 13:55.135
I'm Gus.

13:57.540 --> 14:00.040
- Hi, I'm Ruby.
- Ruby?

14:00.042 --> 14:03.343
Wow.
Of course, that's your name.

14:03.345 --> 14:05.446
Can I get,
can I get you a drink?

14:05.448 --> 14:07.548
I buy my own drinks,
motherfucker.

14:07.550 --> 14:09.484
- Is it?
<i>- Thank you, guys.</i>

14:09.486 --> 14:12.887
For this next song, I'd like you
to put all your technology away

14:12.889 --> 14:14.955
and turn off your brains
for a second.

14:14.957 --> 14:16.357
This song is very special.

14:16.359 --> 14:18.258
It's actually about a girl
in the audience.

14:18.260 --> 14:20.560
My girlfriend actually.

14:20.562 --> 14:23.130
This song's called
"Nobody Knows Your Name."

14:23.132 --> 14:24.464
But I know your name, Ruby.

14:25.633 --> 14:27.366
Wow!

14:28.302 --> 14:31.304
Fuck. I should've known, huh?

14:40.248 --> 14:41.848
Yo, Ruby!

14:44.652 --> 14:47.420
- Gus? What the fuck!
- Sick, right?

14:47.422 --> 14:49.288
Yeah, but I mean, like, how?

14:49.290 --> 14:51.290
Oh, you let me
worry about that. Hop in.

14:51.292 --> 14:52.792
I can't.
I'm going to the country.

14:52.794 --> 14:54.326
Uh, what country?

14:54.328 --> 14:56.328
Connecticut.
I'm on my way to Grand Central.

14:56.330 --> 14:59.465
Ah, fuck that. What, you'd rather
ride the train than ride with me?

14:59.467 --> 15:02.501
No, of course not, but what, are
you gonna drive me to the country?

15:02.503 --> 15:04.370
I'm going to Connecticut now,
man.

15:04.372 --> 15:06.872
What? You're gonna drive me
to Connecticut?

15:06.874 --> 15:08.840
Yeah.

15:19.820 --> 15:22.856
So are you really driving me
to Connecticut right now?

15:22.858 --> 15:25.225
Yeah. I mean, you know,
I've never stolen a car before

15:25.227 --> 15:28.128
and I feel like the open road
is good to, like

15:28.130 --> 15:30.663
I don't know, get away,
you know?

15:30.665 --> 15:32.364
Did you just say stolen a car?

15:32.366 --> 15:33.899
Yeah.

15:33.901 --> 15:36.368
I'm in a stolen fuckin' car
right now?

15:36.370 --> 15:38.402
- Yeah.
- Gus, you're crazy.

16:31.987 --> 16:34.221
- Oh, wait, stop, stop, stop.
- What, what, what?

16:34.223 --> 16:36.523
Oh, no. Look.

16:36.525 --> 16:38.291
What?

16:43.030 --> 16:45.131
- Aw!
- Oh, man.

16:46.300 --> 16:49.835
<i>Oh. I hate that.</i>

16:51.839 --> 16:54.106
A deer shouldn't have
to worry about cars.

16:54.108 --> 16:56.975
How's she supposed to know?

16:56.977 --> 16:59.445
Do you think it's bad
if I take a picture?

16:59.447 --> 17:01.613
I don't think it'll mind.

17:01.615 --> 17:04.683
No, I mean, like...
is it disrespectful?

17:22.271 --> 17:24.304
So what do we do now?

17:49.331 --> 17:50.864
You're such a freak.

18:19.895 --> 18:22.030
<i>So how's your mom doing? So
where are we going, huh?</i>

18:22.032 --> 18:23.965
<i>Where are we going?</i>

18:23.967 --> 18:25.566
Oh, we're going to my friend
Logan's house.

18:25.568 --> 18:27.869
Logan, Logan.
Do I know that guy?

18:27.871 --> 18:29.770
Um, I don't know.
You might have met him.

18:29.772 --> 18:32.706
He's a musician. He's Cool.
A little weird.

18:32.708 --> 18:35.342
Of course, of course.
Yeah, you and your musicians.

18:35.344 --> 18:38.178
I only play the kazoo, so..

18:38.180 --> 18:40.114
- Well..
- I'm tattooing him.

18:40.116 --> 18:42.316
Uhoh. That's trouble.

18:42.318 --> 18:45.553
Ah, it's this triangle
with all these treasures inside.

18:45.555 --> 18:48.289
- Mm-hmm.
- So rad.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.890
You're all about tattoos,
aren't you?

18:49.892 --> 18:52.059
Yeah, it's my thing.

18:52.061 --> 18:54.594
It's like your passion.
You're lucky you have a passion.

18:54.596 --> 18:56.628
It's great you have a passion.

18:59.065 --> 19:01.232
When are you gonna let me
do you?

19:01.234 --> 19:03.568
No way, forever scares me
too much, you know?

19:03.570 --> 19:07.438
Oh, God!
Typical male, commitment phobic.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.074
Yeah, yeah.

19:10.076 --> 19:12.609
Hey, you still with that guy?
What's his name?

19:13.645 --> 19:15.746
- We broke up.
- Really?

19:17.215 --> 19:18.682
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:20.151 --> 19:21.252
Well, whatever. I'm not.

19:21.254 --> 19:23.120
He was a dick.
All men are dicks.

19:23.122 --> 19:24.421
I'm gonna become a lesbian.

19:24.423 --> 19:27.458
I'd like to see that.
Seriously, I'd like to. Yeah.

19:30.594 --> 19:32.494
<i>So Ruby is single.</i>

19:32.496 --> 19:33.929
Operation old maid
in full effect.

19:33.931 --> 19:35.997
You know, I have to say
I'm a little upset

19:35.999 --> 19:37.465
you didn't call to tell me.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.601
Gus, we are friends, that's it.

19:39.603 --> 19:41.469
Really?

19:41.471 --> 19:43.270
<i>Don't.. Stop!</i>

19:43.272 --> 19:44.404
Fuck!

19:50.345 --> 19:53.647
<i>Are you okay?</i>
Yes, I'm fine! I'm annoyed.

19:53.649 --> 19:55.582
Are you alright?
Are you gonna die?

19:55.584 --> 19:57.484
- Okay.
- Are you gonna die?

19:57.486 --> 20:00.286
Yeah, I'm fine. Ah!

20:05.925 --> 20:07.926
Fuck, Gus!

20:11.131 --> 20:12.898
Now what are we gonna do?

20:14.201 --> 20:16.502
Should we call a tow truck?
You fuckin' crazy?

20:16.504 --> 20:19.871
We can't call in
a stolen car, it's a stolen car!

20:21.507 --> 20:24.375
Did you not fuckin' hear me?
You can't call in a stolen car!

20:24.377 --> 20:27.178
I'm calling Logan.
Maybe somebody could pick us up.

20:27.180 --> 20:28.279
<i>Okay.</i>

20:28.281 --> 20:29.947
How many more miles
on the MapQuest?

20:29.949 --> 20:32.349
Fuckin' awesome.
I don't have any service.

20:32.351 --> 20:34.452
Roughly. I think you saw
it last. How many miles...

20:34.454 --> 20:37.488
It's far, Gus!
Far, like 15 miles.

20:37.490 --> 20:38.789
Fuck, okay.

20:39.424 --> 20:41.558
I..

20:41.560 --> 20:44.193
I guess we're walking.

20:47.231 --> 20:50.600
I am not walking 15 miles.

20:50.602 --> 20:53.437
<i>You know, you really</i>
<i>are an asshole, Gus.</i>

20:53.439 --> 20:54.538
You could do anything
and you don't.

20:54.540 --> 20:55.639
Yeah, yeah. I know.

20:55.641 --> 20:57.475
That's my problem, okay? What?

20:57.477 --> 20:59.343
Yeah, I don't do anything,
alright?

20:59.345 --> 21:01.912
Okay, no, no, no.
Don't feel sorry for yourself.

21:01.914 --> 21:04.181
I'm the one that's upset here.

21:04.183 --> 21:05.382
I should have just
taken the train.

21:05.384 --> 21:08.251
I never should have got
in your car.

21:08.253 --> 21:10.520
So you think we should
see other people then?

21:10.522 --> 21:12.021
You're such an asshole.

21:12.023 --> 21:13.889
So I've been told.

21:16.861 --> 21:19.127
Oh, Jesus, really? Ugh.

21:19.129 --> 21:20.495
Not again.

21:24.266 --> 21:26.100
Okay.

21:26.102 --> 21:27.435
<i>You know what..</i>

21:28.637 --> 21:30.704
Um... can you not die?

21:30.706 --> 21:34.341
Because I don't really wanna be
alone in the wilderness.

21:34.343 --> 21:38.345
You're afraid of being alone,
and I'm afraid of commitment.

21:38.347 --> 21:41.182
Okay, just don't try
and talk. Just try and not die.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.553
Okay?

21:46.655 --> 21:47.788
You alright?

21:49.124 --> 21:52.559
Yeah, I'm okay,
I'm okay. I'm okay.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.793
Since when do you have asthma?

21:53.795 --> 21:55.961
Did you have it as a kid?

21:55.963 --> 21:57.830
I don't know, I..
I hurt my neck recently.

21:57.832 --> 21:59.932
Maybe that's why. I don't know.

22:02.535 --> 22:06.672
How many more miles?
Like 12. At least 12 miles.

22:06.674 --> 22:08.840
Fuckin' 12 miles.

22:08.842 --> 22:12.211
That's smart. That seems like a really
smart thing to do for your asthma.

22:12.213 --> 22:13.879
Yeah, fuck off.

22:47.347 --> 22:49.813
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

22:51.683 --> 22:53.350
Going for a swim. You're crazy!

22:53.352 --> 22:55.385
- Yeah, so?
- You're not going for a swim.

22:55.387 --> 22:57.054
Yeah, I am.

22:57.056 --> 22:59.122
You gonna come? Absolutely not.

22:59.124 --> 23:00.256
I'm not going for a swim.

23:00.258 --> 23:01.957
Oh, come on, it'll be romantic.

23:01.959 --> 23:04.994
Oh, "It'll be romantic," he
says as he takes off his pants.

23:04.996 --> 23:06.829
Yeah. Ha ha. Come on!

23:06.831 --> 23:08.297
- No way.
- Are you sure?

23:08.299 --> 23:10.533
I am not swimming.

23:10.535 --> 23:12.167
Oh, my God. Gus, you're crazy!

23:12.169 --> 23:14.035
Oh, my God!

23:16.573 --> 23:18.472
Oh! Come on! Come in!

23:18.474 --> 23:20.207
It's too much romance for me.

23:20.209 --> 23:21.742
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>You comin' in or what?</i>

23:21.744 --> 23:23.143
I told you I'm not swimming.

23:23.145 --> 23:25.278
Okay, good,
it's fuckin' freezing.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.812
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

23:26.814 --> 23:28.614
Hey, at least get that
blood off your face.

23:28.616 --> 23:29.982
<i>You look like a maniac.</i>

23:29.984 --> 23:31.383
Okay.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.687
- Gone?
- It's gone, you're good.

23:35.689 --> 23:37.221
- Alright, give me your jacket.
- No way!

23:37.223 --> 23:39.490
- Give me your fuckin jacket.
- I'm not giving you my jacket!

23:39.492 --> 23:40.958
Give me your fuckin' jacket.
Are you crazy?

23:40.960 --> 23:42.092
Oh, I'm gonna need..

23:43.161 --> 23:45.082
- Give me your fuckin jacket.
- No.

23:50.634 --> 23:52.469
Come on. Yeah.

23:56.673 --> 23:58.875
Now, come on.

24:01.311 --> 24:03.413
- Gus?
- Oh, yeah.

24:10.387 --> 24:12.154
Gus, what are you doing?

24:15.225 --> 24:16.358
What the fuck, Gus?

24:16.360 --> 24:18.593
Whatever happened to privacy,
huh?

24:18.595 --> 24:20.461
What the fuck are you doing?
Is that heroin?

24:20.463 --> 24:22.797
No, it's a turkey sandwich.

24:22.799 --> 24:23.898
What are you gonna do
with that?

24:23.900 --> 24:26.400
I'm gonna eat it.
What do you think?

24:30.105 --> 24:33.674
- You're on heroin, Gus?
- Yeah, from time to time.

24:35.643 --> 24:38.344
You're gonna fuckin'
shoot heroin in front of me?

24:38.346 --> 24:39.446
There's a whole
fuckin' forest around.

24:39.448 --> 24:40.914
What... what do you
fuckin' care?

24:40.916 --> 24:42.015
You put needles in your arm
all the time?

24:42.017 --> 24:44.317
What's the fuckin' difference,
okay?

24:55.227 --> 24:56.861
Ah!

24:57.762 --> 24:58.762
Ah!

25:03.501 --> 25:06.736
Come here. Hey, hey, come here.

25:09.907 --> 25:11.507
Come on.

25:23.988 --> 25:25.855
- You okay?
- Yeah.

25:50.281 --> 25:54.351
- What's it feel like?
- You're fuckin' amazing.

26:17.475 --> 26:19.975
<i>Whoa!</i>

26:19.977 --> 26:23.779
<i>That's a serious</i>
<i>fuckin' werewolf.</i>

26:23.781 --> 26:25.280
<i>What does it mean?</i>

26:26.850 --> 26:29.585
I don't like talking about
the meaning or whatever.

26:29.587 --> 26:31.920
Okay.

26:31.922 --> 26:35.624
It's scary that werewolf.
I like that.

26:35.626 --> 26:37.926
I like that it's scary to people.
Yeah.

26:37.928 --> 26:40.095
But for me,
it's like a guardian angel

26:40.097 --> 26:42.263
or a guard dog or some shit.

26:42.265 --> 26:44.598
You're too gangster
for me, huh?

27:10.627 --> 27:13.160
- Do you have a condom?
- <i> What?</i>

27:13.162 --> 27:16.130
- Do you have a condom?
- <i> Fuck no.</i>

27:16.132 --> 27:18.632
<i>You... you thought I,</i>
<i>you thought I'd think</i>

27:18.634 --> 27:20.868
this would happen?

27:20.870 --> 27:23.036
<i>So what do we do then?</i>

27:24.438 --> 27:27.507
I know what I think
we should do.

28:41.915 --> 28:43.749
Are you kidding me?

28:45.085 --> 28:46.552
Gus?

28:51.191 --> 28:52.958
Gus!

28:56.294 --> 28:58.162
Gus!

29:01.532 --> 29:03.133
Gus!

29:03.135 --> 29:05.301
- <i> Yeah!</i>
- Hey, where are you?

29:05.303 --> 29:07.970
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>
<i>Where do you think I'd be?</i>

29:07.972 --> 29:10.306
<i>I'm takin' a shit, okay?</i>

29:11.675 --> 29:13.275
<i>So chill!</i>

29:14.243 --> 29:17.346
What about toilet paper?

29:17.348 --> 29:19.981
- <i> I'm using a fuckin' leaf!</i>
- Ew!

29:23.820 --> 29:26.320
Okay, how much longer, please.

29:26.322 --> 29:29.524
- I don't know. My phone died.
- Oh, fuck!

29:31.093 --> 29:32.627
You remember how to get there?

29:32.629 --> 29:36.130
- Uh, let's fuckin' hope so.
- Well, do you know the way?

29:36.132 --> 29:39.534
No, I don't know.
I've never been there by foot.

29:41.370 --> 29:44.472
Okay. Shit.
Uh, how much longer, please?

29:44.474 --> 29:47.275
- Mommy, are we there yet?
- Shut up!

29:47.277 --> 29:49.076
- Just shut up.
- I don't know.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.846
I don't know, like...
a couple of hours, 5 miles?

29:51.848 --> 29:54.615
Couple of hours?

29:59.188 --> 30:00.888
Hey, we did it last night,
right?

30:00.890 --> 30:01.922
<i>Shut up!</i>

30:01.924 --> 30:03.124
Was I good?

30:03.126 --> 30:05.659
Seriously, Gus,
that was a one time thing.

30:05.661 --> 30:08.395
We're friends. Don't go
falling in love with me.

30:08.397 --> 30:11.532
- Yeah, you wish.
- And don't tell anyone.

30:11.534 --> 30:13.200
Who am I gonna tell?

30:14.970 --> 30:17.071
But seriously though,
good, right?

30:21.009 --> 30:22.876
Huh?

30:25.479 --> 30:26.846
- Which way? Left or right?
- I don't know.

30:26.848 --> 30:28.881
- Left.
- Left?

30:32.252 --> 30:33.852
Dude, can you wait up for me,
please?

30:33.854 --> 30:34.886
I've rocks in my shoes.

30:34.888 --> 30:36.654
You've rocks
in your fuckin' head.

30:36.656 --> 30:38.923
That was a really
funny joke, Gus.

30:39.991 --> 30:42.192
Seriously, wait for me.

30:52.569 --> 30:54.436
- Oh, you know what?
- What?

30:54.438 --> 30:55.570
What, is this it?

30:55.572 --> 30:57.439
It looks like
my friend's car. I think so.

30:57.441 --> 30:58.540
Alright. Thank God.

30:58.542 --> 30:59.741
I don't know
if I believe in God

30:59.743 --> 31:02.343
but probably, we made it here,
so yeah.

31:13.088 --> 31:14.755
This was happening
literally during that time.

31:14.757 --> 31:16.723
- I know that moment.
- You do know that moment?

31:16.725 --> 31:18.958
I know that moment
in... in life, yeah.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.395
Oh, I love that you're
capturing my wings. -Yeah.

31:22.397 --> 31:24.597
I always imagined myself
with wings.

31:24.599 --> 31:26.833
You totally seem like
you could fly out of the tub.

31:26.835 --> 31:28.701
I know.

31:28.703 --> 31:30.169
What's this one all about?

31:30.171 --> 31:32.371
<i>That's from, uh, that's</i>
<i>from an old French movie.</i>

31:32.373 --> 31:34.440
- <i> Parisian? That looks old.</i>
- <i> Yeah.</i>

31:34.442 --> 31:37.342
Do you know anyone
who can get us some drugs?

31:37.344 --> 31:40.446
Yes, well, the closest guy,
oh, my God, you have to meet him

31:40.448 --> 31:44.249
he lives in a tree house
that he built right by here.

31:59.133 --> 32:03.168
Yeah, I dropped out of high
school at, like, 16. -Nice.

32:03.170 --> 32:05.503
- I did music full time.
- Wow!

32:05.505 --> 32:06.837
I fuckin' know that guy.

32:06.839 --> 32:08.104
- You d.. You know him?
- I mean, not personally.

32:08.106 --> 32:09.639
He's the fuckin' lead singer
of The Other Days.

32:09.641 --> 32:10.773
Why didn't you
say something to me?

32:10.775 --> 32:14.042
<i>I told you</i>
<i>that he was a musician.</i>

32:14.044 --> 32:16.311
<i>Are you gonna be alright?</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

32:16.313 --> 32:18.012
<i>Logan!</i>

32:18.014 --> 32:19.613
It's good.

32:21.083 --> 32:22.716
Oh, my God. Is he coming?

32:22.718 --> 32:24.851
- Logan!
- <i> Ruby!</i>

32:24.853 --> 32:27.754
Hey! Oh, my God.

32:29.323 --> 32:32.325
Thank you so much for coming.

32:32.327 --> 32:34.494
How are you? <i>You have no idea.</i>

32:34.496 --> 32:37.029
We got in a car crash,
and we had to walk here.

32:37.031 --> 32:39.332
You got in a car crash?

32:39.334 --> 32:41.367
- <i> Yeah.</i>
- Are you okay?

32:41.369 --> 32:43.435
- We literally had to walk 15 miles.
- No.

32:43.437 --> 32:46.138
<i>You walked for 15.. Why didn't you call me?
You should've called...</i>

32:46.140 --> 32:49.261
- I didn't have any cell phone service.
- The car was stolen, so..

32:49.808 --> 32:51.342
Sorry, what, you stole a car?

32:51.344 --> 32:53.110
I didn't steal the car,
just to be clear. -I..

32:53.112 --> 32:54.878
- I stole the car.
- I had nothing to do with it.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.079
- Okay.
- <i> Just to clarify.</i>

32:56.081 --> 32:58.449
Okay, that's okay. Hello.

32:58.451 --> 33:00.083
Sorry, this is my friend Gus.

33:00.085 --> 33:02.853
Hey, man, I have to say
I fuckin' love your music, man.

33:02.855 --> 33:03.887
That was like..

33:03.889 --> 33:04.988
When I was growing up..

33:04.990 --> 33:06.956
It was the soundtrack
to my life.

33:06.958 --> 33:08.057
Thank you.

33:08.059 --> 33:11.327
Thanks, man.
Wow, I feel so old now.

33:11.329 --> 33:12.795
- Sorry.
- <i> I'm freezing.</i>

33:12.797 --> 33:16.166
I'm gonna get back in,
but, um, yeah, help yourself.

33:16.168 --> 33:19.836
There's food over there,
and there's drinks.

33:19.838 --> 33:21.004
I'm really happy to see you.

33:21.006 --> 33:22.972
- <i> Yeah.</i>
- And meet you.

33:22.974 --> 33:24.340
You look like Mick Jagger.

33:24.342 --> 33:25.507
I like you, man.

33:25.509 --> 33:28.644
I like you.
You're her car thief.

33:28.646 --> 33:31.346
It's like real life
"Grand Theft Auto" here.

33:31.348 --> 33:33.549
- Peace. We'll catch you up in a bit.
- Amazing.

33:33.551 --> 33:35.417
Alright, that was embarrassing.

33:35.419 --> 33:37.318
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>
<i>Nothing, man.</i>

33:37.320 --> 33:38.920
- <i> You just acted like a super fan.</i>
- <i> I can't appreciate..</i>

33:38.922 --> 33:40.054
<i>I can't appreciate music?</i>

33:40.056 --> 33:42.155
<i>Just keep it together, alright?</i>

33:43.891 --> 33:46.059
I'm good.

33:46.061 --> 33:48.560
Oh, yeah.
No, I, I lost my phone.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.231
I told you,
dad's a fuckin' asshole.

33:52.233 --> 33:53.265
That's not your problem.

33:53.267 --> 33:55.867
You got enough
to worry about as it is.

33:55.869 --> 33:58.871
Well, I'm... I'm,
I'm in Connecticut, yeah.

33:58.873 --> 34:01.193
I don't know, just... just
a spur of the moment thing.

34:02.909 --> 34:05.176
I'm at a friend's place.

34:05.977 --> 34:08.512
No, you don't know her.

34:08.514 --> 34:11.281
Her name's Ruby, ma.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.750
She's just a friend.

34:14.418 --> 34:16.585
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:16.588 --> 34:19.021
No, I'll prob..
I'll probably stay here tonight.

34:28.933 --> 34:32.702
Hey, ma, I, uh...
can't really talk right now..

34:33.770 --> 34:36.237
Okay?

34:36.239 --> 34:38.306
Yeah, I love you too.
Alright, bye.

34:44.947 --> 34:46.315
What a dick.

34:47.382 --> 34:48.882
<i>So what do you do?</i>

34:48.885 --> 34:50.952
If you don't mind my asking.

34:51.853 --> 34:54.154
Um..

34:54.156 --> 34:56.556
I... I work at Taco Bell.

34:57.358 --> 34:58.424
He's an actor.

34:58.426 --> 34:59.858
No, I quit acting.
I quit acting.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.659
He doesn't work at Taco Bell.

35:01.661 --> 35:03.094
That's true, I don't

35:03.096 --> 35:04.829
but, uh, but the tacos,
when you're fucked up

35:04.831 --> 35:05.863
you know,
there ain't nothin' better.

35:05.865 --> 35:07.197
Oh, my God, I love Taco Bell.

35:07.199 --> 35:10.201
Then what the fuck
with all this tofu crap, man?

35:10.203 --> 35:11.969
<i>Fuck.</i>

35:11.971 --> 35:13.537
There's no need to be
so aggressive.

35:13.539 --> 35:15.406
I'm sorry,
I apologize for my friend.

35:15.408 --> 35:16.974
He's had kind of a rough
48 hours.

35:16.976 --> 35:19.810
Oh, I really love that show.

35:19.812 --> 35:24.315
"The First 48 Hours,"
you know... when they..

35:24.317 --> 35:26.351
<i>There's, like, a criminal</i>
<i>that they're trying</i>

35:26.353 --> 35:29.620
to track down for murders
and what not.

35:29.622 --> 35:31.688
It's really good, they..

35:31.690 --> 35:34.892
People always
kinda give up though, it's..

35:34.894 --> 35:36.126
You know..

35:36.128 --> 35:38.462
Thank you for sharing,
Bottlecap.

35:38.464 --> 35:41.398
You come
to a neighbor's house..

35:41.400 --> 35:44.033
And they're kind enough
to cook a fine meal for you

35:44.035 --> 35:45.435
and what do you do?

35:45.437 --> 35:48.671
You insult it. You insult us.

35:51.075 --> 35:53.555
You're probably thinkin' I'm
gonna come after you now, right?

35:56.279 --> 35:58.781
Probably worried I'm gonna
jump across the fire pit

35:58.783 --> 36:02.385
and stab you in the neck with
a... fork, right?

36:07.056 --> 36:09.391
Well, wrong. You know why?

36:10.726 --> 36:14.028
You're just being a human being.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

36:14.030 --> 36:15.864
It's normal.

36:15.866 --> 36:18.132
Those emotions are normal.

36:21.103 --> 36:23.704
Ever since I met Lilly..

36:23.706 --> 36:26.039
It's been a sort of
a spiritual awakening.

36:26.041 --> 36:28.242
You know, on a day-to-day level

36:28.244 --> 36:31.144
like what you put in your body,
it's important.

36:31.146 --> 36:34.715
- Yeah.
- But I really miss meat. I do.

36:36.350 --> 36:38.452
So, um,
you and Lilly are together?

36:38.454 --> 36:39.719
Is that, is that right?

36:39.721 --> 36:42.321
No. We're friends.
Totally friends. -Oh.

36:42.323 --> 36:45.258
<i>But, um, she's my yoga teacher.</i>

36:45.260 --> 36:47.893
And Ragen's my teacher.

36:47.895 --> 36:50.463
No, he's all of our teacher.

36:50.465 --> 36:53.799
And this delicious tofu
is part of his process.

36:53.801 --> 36:56.034
I love the tofu.

36:56.036 --> 37:01.006
I didn't think I would, but the texture
is different, not like food, but..

37:04.145 --> 37:05.711
Nobody gets hurt
from it either.

37:05.713 --> 37:07.112
You can't choke on it.

37:19.726 --> 37:21.360
What's your favorite animal?

37:21.362 --> 37:24.730
My spirit animal or my,
just favorite animal in general?

37:24.732 --> 37:26.031
I didn't really...

37:26.033 --> 37:27.800
I know, but, Bottlecap,
that's your whole..

37:27.802 --> 37:30.869
Job is to write it down,
and you didn't write it down.

37:30.871 --> 37:32.704
What were you thinking?

37:35.441 --> 37:37.308
I feel so relaxed right now.

37:37.310 --> 37:40.412
Really? I'm not feeling
fuckin' anything.

37:46.086 --> 37:48.020
<i>Max!</i>

37:48.022 --> 37:49.187
- Hey, Bree!
- <i> What the fuck?</i>

37:49.189 --> 37:51.023
Have you been here
this whole time?

37:51.025 --> 37:52.124
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

37:52.126 --> 37:53.358
- I haven't seen you!
- I know.

37:53.360 --> 37:56.562
I got super stoned
and passed out and..

37:56.564 --> 37:58.497
Now I can't find my straw hat.

37:58.499 --> 38:00.298
- Have you seen it?
- <i> No, sorry.</i>

38:00.300 --> 38:02.434
My straw hat.
Have you seen my hat?

38:02.436 --> 38:03.535
<i>We'll let you know</i>
<i>if we see it.</i>

38:03.537 --> 38:05.003
Have you seen my hat?

38:05.005 --> 38:08.340
<i>Has anyone seen my hat,</i>
<i>a straw hat?</i>

38:08.342 --> 38:10.008
Fuck, you know,
I left my keys in my hat

38:10.010 --> 38:12.176
and I can't leave
if I don't find my hat.

38:12.178 --> 38:13.610
- It's like..
- <i> Oh!</i>

38:13.612 --> 38:14.778
I always do this.

38:14.780 --> 38:15.979
His fuckin' hat.

38:15.981 --> 38:17.613
Everyone just talks
and talks and talks.

38:17.615 --> 38:20.783
No one's saying a fuckin' thing!

38:20.785 --> 38:23.152
I wish I had some money,
so I can get a house like this

38:23.154 --> 38:24.453
outside of the city.

38:24.455 --> 38:27.223
There's too many bugs
out here. I hate it.

38:27.225 --> 38:30.526
This whole property,
it's so unreal.

38:30.528 --> 38:32.810
I guess I don't really care
that much about money.

38:36.933 --> 38:38.867
I know about you and Logan.

38:41.837 --> 38:43.170
What?

38:43.738 --> 38:45.506
He's my friend.

38:47.075 --> 38:49.543
Last night was amazing,
and now you're just over it.

38:49.545 --> 38:51.812
<i>Can we just really</i>
<i>not do this right now?</i>

38:51.814 --> 38:53.680
I'm, like, rolling
and I'm having fun

38:53.682 --> 38:54.714
and I wanna go swimming.

38:54.716 --> 38:56.883
Alright, fine, go for a swim.

40:19.105 --> 40:21.941
Gussy, Gussy, Gussy.

40:32.919 --> 40:34.219
Too bad you can't sing.

40:34.221 --> 40:36.387
You would've been
a real cool rock singer.

40:36.389 --> 40:38.890
Fuck you, fuck you, okay?

40:38.892 --> 40:40.932
And not that
it's any of your business.

40:48.366 --> 40:50.201
Poor guy.

40:50.969 --> 40:53.070
<i>What a lost soul.</i>

41:04.617 --> 41:06.116
<i>Ruby.</i>

41:08.153 --> 41:09.887
Hey.

41:11.155 --> 41:12.655
Ruby.

41:14.125 --> 41:15.858
Ruby.

41:31.007 --> 41:34.010
- What?
- Oh, man.

41:41.185 --> 41:43.145
I think I might be
in love with you.

41:44.054 --> 41:45.520
Really?

41:47.823 --> 41:49.456
I don't know. Probably.

41:49.458 --> 41:52.793
What's the fuckin' difference?
You're... fuckin' this guy.

41:54.562 --> 41:56.964
- I didn't fuck him.
- Oh, come on. I..

41:56.966 --> 42:01.000
Hey, guys, sorry...
to interrupt

42:01.002 --> 42:03.136
but I'm gonna go
have a cigarette.

42:03.138 --> 42:05.872
I feel a little uncomfortable.

42:05.874 --> 42:08.842
Sorry, man, I... I didn't know
you guys were together.

42:08.844 --> 42:10.510
Yeah, we're not.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.078
Okay.

42:14.648 --> 42:16.949
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

42:18.151 --> 42:19.651
Everything.

42:19.653 --> 42:23.721
Everything? Wow!
Well, at least you're honest.

42:23.723 --> 42:25.789
Let's make babies.

42:26.491 --> 42:27.891
Huh?

42:27.893 --> 42:30.026
<i>Have a family and stuff</i>

42:30.028 --> 42:31.794
<i>and little, like..</i>

42:31.796 --> 42:34.631
Cabbages running
around the city.

42:34.633 --> 42:37.033
Mixtures of you and me.

42:37.035 --> 42:39.169
That'd be pretty fuckin'..

42:43.306 --> 42:45.541
Gus, you're so high.

42:50.782 --> 42:52.548
Forget about it, don't worry.

42:54.450 --> 42:57.553
You got too many tattoos
to be a mommy anyway.

42:57.555 --> 43:00.188
<i>I was... I was just joking.</i>

43:04.194 --> 43:07.629
Fuckin' kids would come out
with fuckin' tattoos anyway.

43:19.342 --> 43:21.743
Happy New Year.

43:23.045 --> 43:25.279
Gimme one of those?

43:28.317 --> 43:32.119
- It's my last one.
- Ooh.

43:32.121 --> 43:33.619
Thank you.

43:35.855 --> 43:36.855
Whoo!

43:36.857 --> 43:38.557
You got a lighter?

43:42.194 --> 43:43.929
I am a lucky..

43:45.097 --> 43:47.164
You are a waste.

43:55.039 --> 43:56.840
What now?

43:58.342 --> 43:59.875
What now?
I don't, I don't know.

43:59.877 --> 44:02.278
I... I think
we're supposed to fight.

44:02.280 --> 44:05.180
I mean, I don't wanna fight.
I... I just..

44:05.182 --> 44:06.447
I don't wanna fight you, man.

44:06.449 --> 44:08.416
It's just what men do
in these situations. They fight.

44:08.418 --> 44:09.950
I'm not, I'm not
a good fighter though.

44:09.952 --> 44:11.818
I don't, I don't think I..

44:11.820 --> 44:14.888
<i>I'd probably</i>
<i>pull your hair or something.</i>

44:14.890 --> 44:17.290
- Don't pull, don't do that.
- <i> Great.</i>

44:17.292 --> 44:20.861
Well... let's... let's agree
to not fight then.

44:20.863 --> 44:26.033
It's... not a good way
to... end a party, you know?

44:26.035 --> 44:28.702
- I don't wanna fight you.
- Okay, good.

44:28.704 --> 44:32.139
I don't even know
why we would be fighting.

44:32.141 --> 44:34.141
This girl.

44:34.143 --> 44:36.542
Oh, yeah, the girl.

44:39.213 --> 44:41.314
Ruby's very special.

44:42.649 --> 44:45.351
Fighting for the girl.

44:45.353 --> 44:47.986
She's tattooing me tomorrow.

44:47.988 --> 44:50.022
No matter what happens
between us

44:50.024 --> 44:52.391
it's, it's gonna last forever

44:52.393 --> 44:54.092
or at least till I'm dead,
you know

44:54.094 --> 44:55.359
and my body decomposes...

45:00.098 --> 45:03.434
Gussy, Gussy, Gussy.

45:03.436 --> 45:05.202
Are you thinking about her?

45:05.204 --> 45:06.503
Yeah, I am now.

45:06.505 --> 45:08.339
Or you thinking about yourself?

45:08.341 --> 45:10.074
No lectures, please.

45:15.314 --> 45:17.234
What do you think
they're doing?

45:18.349 --> 45:20.784
Huh? What do you think
they're doing in there?

45:23.921 --> 45:25.721
Hey.

45:25.723 --> 45:28.391
Great, I can't get you
to shut up

45:28.393 --> 45:30.893
and when I ask you a question..

45:37.000 --> 45:40.236
Let me tell you a story, Gus.

45:40.238 --> 45:43.706
Once upon a time,
there was a young punk

45:43.708 --> 45:45.475
who thought he was invincible

45:45.477 --> 45:48.244
who thought
nothing could hurt him.

45:48.246 --> 45:51.948
And every day, he would go
to fight a dragon.

45:51.950 --> 45:53.582
It's a fuckin' stupid
fairy tale.

45:53.584 --> 45:55.818
You're talking
to a damn werewolf.

45:55.820 --> 45:58.387
And as usual,
you missed the point.

45:58.389 --> 46:02.291
Now shut up and listen.
Learn something for a change.

46:02.293 --> 46:06.061
<i>So this punk would go</i>
<i>into the dragon's lair</i>

46:06.063 --> 46:09.298
<i>and he would yell,</i>
<i>"Hey, you fuckin' dragon</i>"

46:09.300 --> 46:13.335
<i>today is the day is the day."</i>

46:13.337 --> 46:16.706
<i>And the dragon looked up</i>
<i>at him and said.</i>

46:16.708 --> 46:21.043
<i>"Just let the dragon sleep,</i>
<i>Gus."</i>

46:57.815 --> 47:00.149
<i>And pray.</i>

47:01.351 --> 47:03.686
You pray in silence.

47:06.123 --> 47:07.923
Think of..

47:09.358 --> 47:11.625
Something really beautiful.

47:13.694 --> 47:16.163
And enjoy the moment.

47:16.165 --> 47:18.965
Feel the ground..

47:18.967 --> 47:21.434
That you stand upon.

47:23.403 --> 47:24.970
And take a breath in..

47:55.135 --> 47:56.836
What is this?

48:04.276 --> 48:05.843
Huh. Hey, Lou.

48:18.091 --> 48:19.491
Perfect.

48:20.994 --> 48:25.530
Hmm. Is it hard to do them
yourself, to yourself?

48:25.532 --> 48:27.866
Um, I've done this one myself

48:27.868 --> 48:29.868
but the others, I've gotten done
from friends.

48:29.870 --> 48:31.636
Oh, really?

48:33.806 --> 48:36.774
It's interesting to inflict pain
upon yourself.

48:36.776 --> 48:38.943
- It's hard to do.
- Is it harder to do?

48:41.780 --> 48:43.380
<i>Am I hurting you?</i>

48:43.982 --> 48:45.315
Yup.

48:47.418 --> 48:49.753
I was talking to Logan.

48:49.755 --> 48:51.321
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

48:57.996 --> 48:59.462
Almost done.

50:00.524 --> 50:03.660
- Sick, huh?
- Yeah, I love it.

50:03.662 --> 50:05.128
- It's all..
- Yeah, I love it.

50:05.130 --> 50:07.096
It's all Ruby.

50:07.098 --> 50:09.099
Good job.

50:09.101 --> 50:11.935
I like how it's real
spiritually.

50:11.937 --> 50:15.805
I, is it an eye here
and this is a triangle.

50:15.807 --> 50:17.339
And I like how this is a hand.

50:17.341 --> 50:19.574
Now, Shiva would approve.
That's..

50:20.577 --> 50:22.244
- <i> Yes.</i>
- Who is Shiva?

50:22.246 --> 50:23.345
Shiva is God.

50:23.347 --> 50:25.848
- Ragen's an <i> Aghori.</i>
- Oh.

50:25.850 --> 50:28.483
It's this really
weird form of Hinduism.

50:28.485 --> 50:32.688
Uh, actually, I'm... I'm
kinda developing my own practice

50:32.690 --> 50:37.192
<i>you know, but the Aghoris are</i>
<i>a major influence, you know?</i>

50:37.194 --> 50:38.661
So we're doing
this ritual tonight

50:38.663 --> 50:40.462
and I'm gonna take part in it.

50:40.464 --> 50:42.730
Did you ever notice
that almost everything

50:42.732 --> 50:45.400
that feels good is a sin

50:45.402 --> 50:47.335
at least, according
to western religions?

50:47.337 --> 50:49.571
Fuckin' amen to that, brother.

50:49.573 --> 50:51.439
<i>Aghoris</i> believe in the opposite

50:51.441 --> 50:54.842
that everything that... that,
that feels good, it is good.

50:54.844 --> 50:57.345
Hey, um, Logan, can I..

50:57.347 --> 50:59.246
Can I ask you a question?

50:59.248 --> 51:02.283
Um, I gotta, I gotta go
visit a friend

51:02.285 --> 51:05.686
and wondering if I could
borrow your car?

51:05.688 --> 51:06.820
Are you serious?

51:06.822 --> 51:08.322
Yeah, it's kind of
an emergency...

51:08.324 --> 51:10.757
Gus! Are you asking
to borrow his car?

51:10.759 --> 51:12.892
Yeah, my mom's sick, okay?

51:12.894 --> 51:15.629
I gotta go visit her.

51:15.631 --> 51:19.232
That's terrible, man,
I'm... I'm so sorry, I...

51:19.234 --> 51:21.735
- It's okay.
- Is it okay if I drive him?

51:22.570 --> 51:23.903
Um, where are we going?

51:23.905 --> 51:25.204
You know, I really don't
need a babysitter.

51:25.206 --> 51:26.606
Yeah, right.

51:26.608 --> 51:28.741
<i>I don't know where you live.</i>

51:28.743 --> 51:30.642
- <i> Downtown Waterbury.</i>
- <i> Where?</i>

51:30.644 --> 51:34.179
<i>Just take 84</i>
<i>to Highway 8, okay?</i>

51:34.181 --> 51:36.047
<i>We call it the, uh,</i>
<i>The Dirty Water.</i>

51:36.049 --> 51:37.849
- <i> Why The Dirty Water?</i>
- <i> Downtown Waterbury.</i>

51:37.851 --> 51:39.851
<i>- <i>Dirty water.</i>
- <i> I get it.</i></i>

51:46.525 --> 51:48.158
What are we doing? We're
at a pawn shop? <i> Yeah.</i>

51:48.160 --> 51:50.094
<i>Okay, look, I gotta get</i>
<i>my mom a present, alright?</i>

51:50.096 --> 51:52.096
You're gonna get your mom
a present at a pawn shop?

51:52.098 --> 51:53.263
- Yeah.
- Real classy, Gus.

51:53.265 --> 51:54.464
- Thank you.
- What is the matter with you?

51:54.466 --> 51:56.567
You're gonna leave me here?
Is it safe?

51:56.569 --> 51:58.602
Fuck no. Look around, huh?

51:58.604 --> 52:00.484
Oh, my God. I'm gonna kill you.

52:08.779 --> 52:10.913
Jesus Christ.

52:15.318 --> 52:18.219
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

52:18.221 --> 52:20.355
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

52:26.095 --> 52:27.862
Hey, what's up?

52:29.731 --> 52:32.366
Uh, I need,
I need to pawn some shit.

52:34.068 --> 52:35.268
Okay?

52:36.303 --> 52:37.470
There you go.

52:37.472 --> 52:39.505
Hey, that's a real Rolex, okay?

52:40.807 --> 52:43.441
- 60.
- Sold. Sold.

52:43.443 --> 52:45.710
How much for the cards?

52:47.379 --> 52:49.748
- 2 bucks a piece.
- Are you nuts?

52:49.750 --> 52:53.151
That's Larry Johnson,
Kevin McHale and Lew Alcindor.

52:53.153 --> 52:55.721
What the fuck do I care about
Lew Alcindor?

52:55.723 --> 52:58.623
That's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's
rookie card.

53:00.359 --> 53:02.394
What do you take me for?

53:19.146 --> 53:21.848
- What the fuck?
- What?

53:21.850 --> 53:23.649
Look at this bum.

53:23.651 --> 53:25.618
Uh, I think homeless
is a nicer way to say it.

53:25.620 --> 53:28.320
He has been staring at me
jerking off.

53:28.322 --> 53:30.522
- Maybe he has an itch.
- I'm gonna throw up.

53:30.524 --> 53:32.625
Oh, come on, it's a compliment.

53:34.327 --> 53:36.161
- So what did you get for your mom?
- What?

53:36.163 --> 53:38.030
What'd you get your mom?
In the pawn shop?

53:38.032 --> 53:39.898
Uh, here.

53:41.300 --> 53:44.236
- Baseball cards?
- Basketball cards.

53:44.238 --> 53:46.938
My mom used to take me
to Knicks games as a kid.

53:46.940 --> 53:50.275
That's Larry Johnson
and Lew Alcindor's rookie card

53:50.277 --> 53:51.709
who would later
change his name to...

53:51.711 --> 53:53.277
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

53:55.347 --> 53:56.413
How the fuck did you know that?

53:56.415 --> 53:58.314
Everybody knows that.

54:03.288 --> 54:07.323
Um... where is, where's your
house? Where are we going?

54:07.325 --> 54:09.993
Uh, just take a right here.

54:15.800 --> 54:17.699
- Right.
- <i> Okay.</i>

54:19.836 --> 54:23.205
Just..
Just pull up here a sec, okay?

54:23.207 --> 54:25.073
Right here. Right here. Just chill.
<i>Now what?</i>

54:25.075 --> 54:27.843
- Just wait here a sec, okay?
- You're not leaving me again.

54:27.845 --> 54:30.645
Why? You in love
with me or something?

54:30.647 --> 54:32.981
I just don't wanna get raped
or murdered, okay?

54:32.983 --> 54:34.682
Can we just go to your mom's
house and get this over with?

54:34.684 --> 54:36.050
Just chill for one sec, okay?

54:36.052 --> 54:37.552
- Just wait.
- Oh, my God.

54:37.554 --> 54:39.620
Okay, Gus, we should go,
Gus, we should go. Chill.

54:39.622 --> 54:41.021
Yo, hair long, what's goin'
on? You lost or somethin'?

54:41.023 --> 54:43.591
Oh, man, my fuckin' head's
killing me, bro.

54:43.593 --> 54:44.992
You wanna get some medicine?

54:44.994 --> 54:46.126
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:46.128 --> 54:47.827
- <i> You a cop?</i>
- <i> Fuck, no, man.</i>

54:47.829 --> 54:48.961
<i>Do I look like a fuckin' cop?</i>

54:48.963 --> 54:50.363
<i>Alright. What you looking for?</i>

54:50.365 --> 54:51.497
Let's have
some China White, man.

54:51.499 --> 54:52.931
Yo, fool, look around.

54:52.933 --> 54:54.866
Ain't no motherfuckin'
China White up in this piece.

54:54.868 --> 54:56.702
I got that brown shit though
if that's what you lookin' for?

54:56.704 --> 54:58.637
- Yeah, man, that's perfect.
- Alright, how much do you want?

54:58.639 --> 55:00.071
Uh, give me 40
and make it fat, alright?

55:00.073 --> 55:01.205
- Alright. I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

55:01.207 --> 55:03.374
- I'll get it.
- Cool, bro. Cheers.

55:03.376 --> 55:05.642
You're buying drugs? -What
do you want from me, huh?

55:05.644 --> 55:08.479
You're gonna get loaded
before we go see your mom?

55:13.118 --> 55:15.352
We're not going to see your mom,
are we?

55:15.354 --> 55:17.587
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

55:17.589 --> 55:19.990
I can't believe
I bought this shit.

55:26.831 --> 55:30.133
- My man.
- <i> Hey, thanks, man.</i>

55:30.135 --> 55:31.668
- Oh, motherfucker!
- Gus, wait!

55:31.670 --> 55:33.269
- <i> You motherfucker.</i>
- No, Gus!

55:33.271 --> 55:35.304
- Hey!
- <i> Gus!</i>

56:15.549 --> 56:17.816
Oh, fuck!

56:20.921 --> 56:23.154
Hey, you guys see... see
two people pass here?

56:25.090 --> 56:27.425
Hey, man, you guys
got any shit to, to buy?

56:27.427 --> 56:29.693
I just, I just need a quick fix.
You got money?

56:29.695 --> 56:31.656
Yeah, I got, like, 20 bucks,
please.

56:32.830 --> 56:35.464
Oh, thank you.
You cookin' here?

56:35.466 --> 56:37.366
<i>No, man.</i>

56:37.368 --> 56:39.601
<i>Alright, I gotta get home.</i>

56:41.537 --> 56:43.572
Must be nice.

56:44.607 --> 56:47.241
Oh, fuck.

56:49.411 --> 56:51.044
Thank God.

57:01.187 --> 57:03.322
Why are you so sad?

57:03.324 --> 57:05.357
You know, I'm enjoying my life

57:05.359 --> 57:06.458
more than most people, okay?

57:06.460 --> 57:07.960
Yeah, at everybody else's
expense.

57:07.962 --> 57:10.429
Oh, what, like,
I'm the only one?

57:10.431 --> 57:13.064
Everyone I know
is a fuckin' addict.

57:13.066 --> 57:16.802
Cigarettes and alcohol kill
more people than, than drugs.

57:16.804 --> 57:18.737
And not to mention
fuckin' pharmaceuticals.

57:18.739 --> 57:21.307
Half of America's
a fuckin' addict!

57:21.309 --> 57:22.808
I just don't pay taxes
on my shit.

57:22.810 --> 57:25.745
That's all anyone fuckin'
cares about, it's fuckin' money!

57:30.183 --> 57:31.651
What is this,
the silent treatment, huh?

57:31.653 --> 57:33.753
You lied about
your mother being sick

57:33.755 --> 57:35.588
so you could buy drugs, Gus.

57:35.590 --> 57:40.059
<i>No!</i>-That is so wrong
on so many levels.

57:40.061 --> 57:42.761
You don't give a shit
about anybody or anything.

57:42.763 --> 57:45.297
All you fuckin' care about
is your fuckin' smack.

57:45.299 --> 57:46.998
Why don't you go and fuck.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.701
Mr. The Other Days,
the vegetarian rock star

57:49.703 --> 57:51.035
and just leave me
the fuck alone.

57:51.037 --> 57:52.636
- Okay.
- <i> I'm so fuckin' stupid.</i>

57:52.638 --> 57:56.107
- Fine.
- I'm so fuckin' dumb!

57:56.109 --> 57:59.410
You know, we made love, alright?
And I thought that was real.

57:59.412 --> 58:02.846
<i>And you skip off and give me</i>
<i>the fuckin' run around.</i>

58:05.783 --> 58:07.551
Fuck.

58:09.554 --> 58:11.921
You fell asleep inside me.

58:13.925 --> 58:16.493
- What?
- You fell asleep.

58:16.495 --> 58:20.497
You nodded off in the middle
of having sex with me.

58:23.167 --> 58:25.034
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

58:25.036 --> 58:27.404
<i>what that feels like</i>
<i>for a girl?</i>

58:28.305 --> 58:30.205
Ruby.

58:30.207 --> 58:31.440
Listen... <i>I don't fuckin' care.</i>

58:31.442 --> 58:33.975
- It's dope.
- I don't care.

58:38.480 --> 58:40.414
Fuck it, whatever.

58:40.416 --> 58:42.249
- Whatever, baby.
- Whatever.

58:42.251 --> 58:46.319
You know what?
Fuckin' dig that gold.

58:46.321 --> 58:49.523
Fuckin' keep digging
that fuckin' gold.

58:49.525 --> 58:51.558
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, dig it.

58:51.560 --> 58:53.259
- Fuck you.
- Dig gold, baby.

58:53.261 --> 58:54.627
- Fuck you!
- <i> Fuck you.</i>

58:54.629 --> 58:56.831
I'm not gonna let
some fuckin' junkie judge me!

58:57.766 --> 58:58.898
You're... sitting there

58:58.900 --> 59:01.501
and shooting up in front of me?

59:01.503 --> 59:03.503
<i>Oh, I'm a fuckin' gold digger</i>

59:03.505 --> 59:06.772
<i>because I'm not like,</i>
<i>"Hey, awesome, yippee!</i>"

59:06.774 --> 59:10.510
"I've got no money and no job,
no ambition

59:10.512 --> 59:12.178
"and I spend all my money
on smack.

59:12.180 --> 59:13.713
What a catch!"

59:13.715 --> 59:15.448
That makes me
a fuckin' gold digger?

59:15.450 --> 59:17.116
- Whatever, baby.
- <i> Fuck you.</i>

59:17.118 --> 59:18.617
Fuck you.

59:18.619 --> 59:21.187
This has nothing to do
with Logan, I mean..

59:21.189 --> 59:23.022
At least, he has
his fuckin' shit together.

59:23.024 --> 59:24.189
I'm a grown up, Gus.

59:24.191 --> 59:26.392
I'm a grown-ass woman.
I'm older than you.

59:26.394 --> 59:29.461
What am I fuckin' doing
wasting my time with you?

59:33.032 --> 59:35.566
What am I doing?

59:56.021 --> 59:57.254
Gus?

59:57.989 --> 59:59.655
Gus.

01:00:02.059 --> 01:00:03.325
<i>Gus.</i>

01:00:04.327 --> 01:00:06.194
Gus, Gus!

01:00:06.196 --> 01:00:07.696
Fuck. Gus.

01:00:08.831 --> 01:00:11.031
Gus, are you alright?

01:00:12.533 --> 01:00:15.335
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:00:15.337 --> 01:00:16.969
Oh, God.

01:00:32.719 --> 01:00:35.119
Jesus Christ.

01:00:37.189 --> 01:00:39.590
Gus, get out of the car.
I'm fine.

01:00:40.358 --> 01:00:42.125
Come on, get up.

01:00:43.528 --> 01:00:45.262
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:00:45.264 --> 01:00:47.697
Okay, okay.

01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:49.332
If he's not in immediate danger

01:00:49.334 --> 01:00:51.367
you need to fill out the forms
and wait your turn.

01:00:51.369 --> 01:00:52.935
Look, lady,
you're not listening to me.

01:00:52.937 --> 01:00:54.569
He is in immediate danger.

01:00:54.571 --> 01:00:57.405
He practically
just OD'd in my car.

01:01:00.208 --> 01:01:02.376
Okay, he definitely
has problems

01:01:02.378 --> 01:01:04.244
but he's not
in immediate danger.

01:01:04.246 --> 01:01:07.481
So please, take a seat
and fill out the form.

01:01:07.483 --> 01:01:09.683
Lady, I'm not an expert, but
he's the color green.

01:01:09.685 --> 01:01:11.584
He just threw up
and it was a weird color

01:01:11.586 --> 01:01:12.818
and if I hadn't been there

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.320
he probably would have
choked on it and died.

01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:16.722
I think something is very wrong
with him and he needs help.

01:01:16.724 --> 01:01:18.023
Can you please get a doctor?

01:01:18.025 --> 01:01:20.459
This is a fuckin' hospital,
can you get a doctor?

01:01:20.461 --> 01:01:23.428
First... please don't raise
your voice.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.597
And where did he go?

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.667
Uh..

01:01:29.669 --> 01:01:31.236
Gus?

01:01:31.238 --> 01:01:34.339
Argh! Gus!

01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:37.943
Um, excuse me, Flannel.
Uh, it'll be just a minute.

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:39.344
Gus?

01:01:40.746 --> 01:01:42.046
Gus?

01:01:42.048 --> 01:01:44.249
Hi, did somebody sick-looking
just went past here?

01:01:44.251 --> 01:01:45.683
Yeah, it's a hospital.

01:01:45.685 --> 01:01:47.985
Alright, smart ass,
thanks a lot.

01:01:47.987 --> 01:01:49.988
<i>- Gus!</i>
- Sick people everywhere.

01:01:50.923 --> 01:01:53.424
Gus!

01:01:59.531 --> 01:02:01.332
<i>Gus, what the fuck?</i>

01:02:01.334 --> 01:02:02.866
Dude, you can't just leave me
like that.

01:02:02.868 --> 01:02:04.601
I've been looking everywhere
for you. You need a doctor.

01:02:04.603 --> 01:02:07.638
Look... I'm fine.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.574
You're not fine.
You just threw up in the car.

01:02:10.576 --> 01:02:13.911
That's my bad.
I... I'm... I'm fine.

01:02:13.913 --> 01:02:16.079
Honestly, I'm fine.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.114
How amazing is that?

01:02:21.684 --> 01:02:23.885
Fucking amazing, huh?

01:02:25.822 --> 01:02:30.792
It's like a day old, not even,
it's like an hour old.

01:02:30.794 --> 01:02:32.561
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

01:02:34.297 --> 01:02:37.300
It doesn't know anything yet.

01:02:37.302 --> 01:02:39.368
It's completely pure.

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:47.676
<i>Do you think that</i>
<i>we're born a certain way..</i>

01:02:49.012 --> 01:02:52.147
Or that life shapes us
into who we are?

01:03:06.731 --> 01:03:08.499
That one's really ugly.

01:03:08.501 --> 01:03:12.436
Well, you know, ugly babies,
they need love too.

01:03:16.774 --> 01:03:18.641
Come on.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.990
Hohoho,
it's about fuckin' time.

01:04:36.992 --> 01:04:38.491
So glad you could make it.

01:04:38.493 --> 01:04:40.593
Yeah, sorry I'm late.

01:04:41.861 --> 01:04:43.963
Apology accepted.

01:04:50.404 --> 01:04:51.904
<i>What's that?</i>

01:04:51.906 --> 01:04:54.640
Meat.
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:04:58.178 --> 01:05:00.812
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:04.817
<i>I don't mean any disrespect,</i>
<i>but can I please go?</i>

01:05:04.819 --> 01:05:08.221
<i>That's alright, Lilly.</i>
<i>Shiva insists on free will.</i>

01:05:08.223 --> 01:05:10.456
Yeah, but... this is too much.

01:05:11.558 --> 01:05:13.259
<i>Of course.</i>

01:05:13.261 --> 01:05:14.893
<i>Shh.</i>

01:05:18.631 --> 01:05:22.868
Would you rather be a lion
or a squirrel?

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:26.572
The ancient <i>Aghori</i> believed
that the best way to honor

01:05:26.574 --> 01:05:29.707
Shiva and her principles
was to eat human flesh.

01:05:31.277 --> 01:05:32.810
Shut up.

01:05:32.812 --> 01:05:34.945
It's true.

01:05:55.435 --> 01:05:59.037
<i>Gussy, Gussy, Gussy.</i>

01:05:59.039 --> 01:06:02.441
Well, if she wants to hang out
with fucking cannibal freaks..

01:06:02.443 --> 01:06:04.876
Be my fucking guest.

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:07.645
I'm sure that's good
for your asthma.

01:06:08.313 --> 01:06:10.480
Fuck off.

01:06:12.817 --> 01:06:14.083
Where we going?

01:06:14.085 --> 01:06:16.185
As far away from
that low scene as possible.

01:06:16.187 --> 01:06:18.053
Far far fucking away.

01:06:18.055 --> 01:06:21.624
"Most men pursue pleasure
with such breathless haste

01:06:21.626 --> 01:06:23.125
that they hurry past it."

01:06:23.127 --> 01:06:25.828
Hey, leave Kierkegaard
out of this, okay?

01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:28.030
He got nothing to do with it.

01:06:28.032 --> 01:06:30.900
It means slow the fuck down.

01:06:45.715 --> 01:06:47.449
That is not what I meant.

01:06:47.451 --> 01:06:50.820
No, no, no.
I'm a fucking addict, okay?

01:07:18.885 --> 01:07:21.051
Put your hands
where I can see them.

01:07:22.953 --> 01:07:24.486
Sir!

01:07:26.656 --> 01:07:28.890
Put your hands
on the steering wheel.

01:07:32.895 --> 01:07:34.862
<i>Alright.</i>

01:07:37.066 --> 01:07:38.986
<i>They don't know the real truth.</i>

01:07:42.504 --> 01:07:47.208
They don't know the real truth.

01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:49.811
Obama's in the White House.

01:07:59.789 --> 01:08:03.458
I'm in jail. Ugh, fucking jail!

01:08:08.697 --> 01:08:10.464
Hey, you..

01:08:11.666 --> 01:08:14.135
Do you know the real truth?

01:08:14.137 --> 01:08:16.103
What's that, man?

01:08:16.104 --> 01:08:19.107
Did you vote for Obama?

01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:21.341
No, man, I didn't vote.

01:08:21.344 --> 01:08:23.911
You know Obama's trying
to steal all the money

01:08:23.912 --> 01:08:26.113
from the Native Americans?

01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:31.419
Fuckin' a.. Really he is.

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:33.587
That's why I'm in here.

01:08:33.589 --> 01:08:36.656
I had a website up
telling the truth.

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:39.426
We had to get the truth
out there.

01:08:39.428 --> 01:08:42.462
And my website crashed again.

01:08:43.198 --> 01:08:45.331
I'm in jail.

01:08:47.934 --> 01:08:50.502
It's not a coincidence.

01:08:50.505 --> 01:08:52.104
I'm an Arawak..

01:08:53.305 --> 01:08:57.176
And we are owed
2 billion dollars.

01:08:57.178 --> 01:08:59.044
Do you think a black guy is
gonna give us

01:08:59.046 --> 01:09:01.180
our 2 billion dollars?

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:06.216
You know, I hate to say it..

01:09:07.286 --> 01:09:09.287
But if somebody
doesn't pay us..

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:12.421
Somebody might make him..

01:09:13.091 --> 01:09:15.559
Go away.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.460
'Cause that's a lot of money.

01:09:18.895 --> 01:09:20.529
Money, money, money.

01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:24.031
You know, that's what it's all
about at the end of the day.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:28.502
And that's a crazy part
about it.

01:09:29.203 --> 01:09:31.537
We need the money..

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.140
Just so we can go
live someplace

01:09:34.142 --> 01:09:36.341
where money doesn't matter.

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:40.578
You fuckin' hear me?

01:09:41.979 --> 01:09:43.413
Hey!

01:09:48.519 --> 01:09:51.720
Do you fucking hear me
or am I talking to myself?

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:57.827
I asked you a question,
motherfuck.

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:01.131
<i>Gottsegen.</i>

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.270
Three steps back, please.
Little bit more. There you go.

01:11:49.252 --> 01:11:51.620
Where are we going?
The turn off is back there.

01:11:51.622 --> 01:11:53.154
<i>I'm not taking you</i>
<i>back into the city.</i>

01:11:53.156 --> 01:11:55.357
<i>Not in the shape you're in.</i>

01:11:56.425 --> 01:11:58.726
Where are you taking me?

01:11:58.728 --> 01:12:00.260
<i>Your mother's.</i>

01:12:08.036 --> 01:12:09.536
I don't know, Gus.

01:12:09.538 --> 01:12:12.740
You know..

01:12:12.742 --> 01:12:14.641
You know, somewhere along
the line, you gotta take

01:12:14.643 --> 01:12:16.809
a little bit of responsibility,
just a little bit.

01:12:16.811 --> 01:12:19.779
Oh, put that thing out.

01:12:19.781 --> 01:12:21.380
I'm an addict, dad, okay?

01:12:21.382 --> 01:12:24.650
Yeah, but you've..
I bet you are.

01:12:24.652 --> 01:12:26.084
I bet you are.
Get your hands off me.

01:12:26.086 --> 01:12:27.385
Let me see this. -Get
your fucking hands off me.

01:12:27.387 --> 01:12:29.588
<i>How'd.. What is that?</i>
<i>How'd you get those?</i>

01:12:29.589 --> 01:12:30.889
<i>I got them playing hoops, dad.</i>

01:12:30.891 --> 01:12:32.523
Okay, you want to give me
an honest answer now?

01:12:32.525 --> 01:12:33.991
No. Of course not.

01:12:33.993 --> 01:12:35.726
'Cause you don't even
think that I just bailed you

01:12:35.728 --> 01:12:38.129
out of county
for heroin possession

01:12:38.131 --> 01:12:39.663
<i>and driving a stolen car.</i>

01:12:39.665 --> 01:12:43.767
<i>You know, you're lucky</i>
<i>he's not pressing charges. I..</i>

01:12:43.769 --> 01:12:46.402
Not... not every kid
whose parents get divorced

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:48.170
e... e... ends up
being a drug addict.

01:12:48.172 --> 01:12:51.207
You... you decided to do that.
That was you.

01:12:53.043 --> 01:12:55.845
You're killing your mother.
Oh, fuck you.

01:12:55.847 --> 01:12:57.112
Since when do you
care about her?

01:12:57.114 --> 01:12:58.146
I never stopped
caring about your mother...

01:12:58.148 --> 01:12:59.347
<i>Oh, cut the crap.</i>

01:12:59.349 --> 01:13:01.283
When was the last time
you went to see her?

01:13:01.285 --> 01:13:02.717
Tell me, when was the last time
you went to see her?

01:13:02.719 --> 01:13:04.085
When was the last time
you called her?

01:13:04.087 --> 01:13:07.055
When was the last time you
checked to see if she was okay?

01:13:07.057 --> 01:13:09.957
She's my ex-wife.
She's not my wife.

01:13:09.959 --> 01:13:12.392
She's all alone,
and you don't even care.

01:13:39.658 --> 01:13:42.259
Can I borrow some money?

01:13:42.261 --> 01:13:44.161
Sure, sure.

01:13:44.163 --> 01:13:47.330
I'll take it out of the damages
to the Rolls.

01:13:47.332 --> 01:13:49.900
You know,
you just left it in the woods?

01:13:49.902 --> 01:13:52.302
Gus, you didn't even, you didn't
even make a phone call.

01:13:52.304 --> 01:13:54.605
You didn't even.. Were you
gonna ever tell anybody?

01:13:54.607 --> 01:13:57.240
W, what did... what did you
think was gonna happen to it?

01:14:01.112 --> 01:14:02.545
- Coming in?
- <i> No.</i>

01:14:02.547 --> 01:14:04.680
<i>No, Gus, I'm not coming in.</i>

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:09.952
Dad, I mean... she's sick.

01:14:09.954 --> 01:14:12.855
And it could be the last time.

01:14:12.857 --> 01:14:15.624
Let me ask you something.

01:14:15.626 --> 01:14:17.926
Are you going in there to give
her love and support?

01:14:17.928 --> 01:14:20.829
Or are you're just going in
to take her money?

01:14:22.064 --> 01:14:24.065
Both.

01:15:00.573 --> 01:15:03.074
<i>Today's a good day.</i>
<i>She'll be happy to see you.</i>

01:15:03.076 --> 01:15:04.575
<i>Well, I'm happy to see you.</i>

01:15:04.577 --> 01:15:06.076
- Well, I'll leave you alone.
- Okay.

01:15:06.078 --> 01:15:07.211
Give me a shout
if you need anything.

01:15:07.213 --> 01:15:09.446
Mm, my Gus. Mmm.

01:15:09.448 --> 01:15:11.047
- Mwah.
- You smell like cigarettes.

01:15:11.049 --> 01:15:14.518
Yeah, well, dad was smoking
in the car.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.785
He didn't wanna come in, huh?

01:15:15.787 --> 01:15:18.320
Uh, he wanted to, but I told
him to go fuck himself.

01:15:18.322 --> 01:15:20.423
Good thinking.

01:15:21.591 --> 01:15:23.124
I'm scared, Gus.

01:15:23.126 --> 01:15:26.461
Mom, please,
just chill... alright?

01:15:26.463 --> 01:15:28.663
Cindy says you're doing well.
She says your vitals are good.

01:15:28.665 --> 01:15:31.667
<i>So, just please, stop</i>
<i>stressing yourself out, okay?</i>

01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:33.502
What does Cindy know?
She doesn't know anything.

01:15:33.504 --> 01:15:34.769
- Ma...
- I know myself.

01:15:34.771 --> 01:15:37.305
I can't deal with this
right now, okay?

01:15:41.811 --> 01:15:45.013
Hey, look... I got you a present.
Should I?

01:15:45.015 --> 01:15:46.214
- Presents?
- Yeah.

01:15:46.216 --> 01:15:48.383
Mmm, I like presents.

01:15:48.385 --> 01:15:51.786
- Look, basketball cards.
- Oh..

01:15:51.788 --> 01:15:53.654
- That's Larry Johnson.
- Oh, thanks.

01:15:53.656 --> 01:15:55.189
And that's Lew Alcindor's
rookie card.

01:15:55.191 --> 01:15:58.025
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Karee..

01:15:58.027 --> 01:15:59.393
- Kareem.
- Yeah, skyhook.

01:15:59.395 --> 01:16:02.029
- Skyhook.
- Skyhook.

01:16:02.031 --> 01:16:04.498
You remember when you used to take
me to Knicks games when I was a kid?

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.735
How could I forget? You made me take
you home after the first quarter.

01:16:07.737 --> 01:16:10.237
Hey, ma, I was 5 years old.
What do you expect?

01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:16.610
You're staying here, right?

01:16:16.612 --> 01:16:18.713
- Yeah, of course, of course.
- Tonight?

01:16:18.715 --> 01:16:21.782
- Good.
- We'll hang out later.

01:16:21.784 --> 01:16:24.852
I was wondering if I could
borrow the car for a little bit?

01:16:24.854 --> 01:16:27.421
I I need the car here in case I
have to go back to the hospital.

01:16:27.423 --> 01:16:29.556
You're gonna be fine, and
look, you can take the wagon.

01:16:29.558 --> 01:16:31.659
I sold the wagon. -What do
you mean you sold the wagon?

01:16:31.661 --> 01:16:33.127
Why did you sell the wagon?
Why did I need two cars?

01:16:33.129 --> 01:16:34.294
I used to go to school
in that car.

01:16:34.296 --> 01:16:37.264
For me! Ma, for me.

01:16:40.301 --> 01:16:42.035
Can I take the bike at least?

01:16:42.037 --> 01:16:44.071
- That bike's too dangerous.
- You didn't sell that, did you?

01:16:44.073 --> 01:16:45.705
No, I am selling it.
It's too dangerous.

01:16:45.707 --> 01:16:48.375
Oh, my God, you used to
drive it all the time.

01:16:48.377 --> 01:16:51.244
I looked good on that bike.
It's too dangerous.

01:16:56.617 --> 01:16:58.317
Where are you going?

01:16:58.319 --> 01:17:01.087
- I have a date with Destiny.
- <i> Who?</i>

01:17:01.089 --> 01:17:04.090
This girl I met on
Craigslist. Her name's Destiny.

01:17:04.092 --> 01:17:05.591
She's Dominican Republican,
you know.

01:17:05.593 --> 01:17:07.493
She's got blue eyes,
got a slamming ass.

01:17:07.495 --> 01:17:09.761
You know, massive kabukas..
<i>Big tits?</i>

01:17:09.763 --> 01:17:12.063
- Hope you like big boobs.
- Yeah, I love big boobs.

01:17:12.065 --> 01:17:13.732
Oh, she loves me.

01:17:15.936 --> 01:17:19.038
Seriously though, ma..

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.173
Can I borrow some money
for dinner?

01:17:22.675 --> 01:17:23.875
Is it really for dinner, Gus?

01:17:23.877 --> 01:17:25.844
- <i> Yes.</i>
- Gus, really?

01:17:25.846 --> 01:17:28.046
Ma, why is it so hard
to believe that I have a date?

01:17:28.048 --> 01:17:29.781
Because you haven't
taken a shower.

01:17:29.783 --> 01:17:31.250
I can't believe you are going on a date.
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:17:31.252 --> 01:17:32.284
<i>- Ma...</i>
- Look me in the eye.

01:17:32.286 --> 01:17:33.551
- Why? Why?
- <i> Gus.</i>

01:17:33.553 --> 01:17:35.419
I wanna make sure
you are telling me the truth.

01:17:35.421 --> 01:17:37.255
Look me in the eye, come on.

01:17:37.257 --> 01:17:39.557
- Ma...
- <i> Look me in the eye.</i>

01:17:45.163 --> 01:17:48.232
- Thank you.
- Is it? See? Just..

01:17:48.234 --> 01:17:49.900
Uh, take the wallet out. Okay.

01:17:49.902 --> 01:17:50.967
- Bring it over here.
- Alright.

01:17:50.969 --> 01:17:52.501
- Over here, Gus. Gus.
- Yeah.

01:17:52.503 --> 01:17:53.602
- Bring it over he...
- Ma..

01:17:53.604 --> 01:17:55.871
- Gus, bring it over here.
- Okay.

01:17:55.873 --> 01:17:58.740
- Here.
- <i> Take 40.</i>

01:17:58.742 --> 01:18:01.710
<i>It's 20, 20, 10, okay?</i>

01:18:01.712 --> 01:18:03.645
<i>I'm putting the wallet back.</i>
Thank you.

01:18:03.647 --> 01:18:05.546
There it goes.

01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:08.249
Thank you.

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:11.485
What's this girl's name again?

01:18:11.487 --> 01:18:14.288
It's that girl, Ruby
I told you about.

01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:16.556
- Oh, yeah, Ruby.
- Hmm.

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:18.959
I thought you said
she was just your friend?

01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:21.794
Yeah, she is though she..
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:22.562 --> 01:18:24.730
But I love her now.

01:19:59.486 --> 01:20:01.654
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:09.895
Were you waiting here for me?

01:20:09.897 --> 01:20:12.464
<i>Don't flatter yourself.</i>

01:20:14.266 --> 01:20:16.100
Why? You're not happy to see me?

01:20:20.338 --> 01:20:22.505
No, it's not that.

01:20:22.507 --> 01:20:25.942
Uhoh. Sounds like something.

01:20:27.244 --> 01:20:29.445
Should we talk?

01:20:34.218 --> 01:20:36.253
I think so.

01:20:36.255 --> 01:20:39.122
Fuck that. That sounds
like a terrible idea.

01:20:40.457 --> 01:20:41.890
I didn't come here
for a big talk.

01:20:41.892 --> 01:20:44.126
What did you come here for?

01:20:51.734 --> 01:20:54.603
Ruby... I might be
in love with you...

01:20:54.605 --> 01:20:58.706
- Don't. Mmm-mmm.
- Oh, don't what?

01:21:00.143 --> 01:21:01.175
Hey.

01:21:02.477 --> 01:21:04.611
Don't make this harder for me.

01:21:09.183 --> 01:21:11.383
Is it about Logan?

01:21:14.388 --> 01:21:18.590
No. It's not about Logan.

01:21:19.358 --> 01:21:21.292
It's about me.

01:21:21.294 --> 01:21:23.374
And I just told him
the same fucking thing.

01:21:29.367 --> 01:21:31.202
I need to be alone.

01:21:32.904 --> 01:21:35.939
I'm never alone.
I've never been alone.

01:21:35.941 --> 01:21:40.543
And it's hard.
It's hard to break patterns.

01:21:40.545 --> 01:21:42.879
And I need to be
with a grown up.

01:21:47.317 --> 01:21:50.520
<i>So that maybe he can</i>
<i>teach me what that means.</i>

01:21:59.931 --> 01:22:02.566
Wait, what are..
You-you're leaving?

01:22:04.268 --> 01:22:06.503
What's the difference?

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:09.539
This is how you're leaving?

01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:11.841
What am I supposed to do? I..

01:22:11.843 --> 01:22:13.977
I don't know.

01:22:18.015 --> 01:22:19.582
Come give me a hug.

01:22:19.584 --> 01:22:22.284
Fuck. Alright, fine.

01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:35.731
Hey, what if I cleaned up?

01:22:38.802 --> 01:22:40.803
What if I cleaned up?

01:22:40.805 --> 01:22:43.373
You know, I could, I could.

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:46.342
I'm just young.
I'm just... just experimenting.

01:22:46.344 --> 01:22:48.244
I mean, I'm just a dick.

01:22:48.246 --> 01:22:51.046
You know, I could,
I could, Ruby.

01:22:53.682 --> 01:22:55.784
You know, you could help me.

01:22:56.819 --> 01:23:00.522
For you... for you I could stop.

01:23:04.193 --> 01:23:06.295
Gus.

01:23:06.297 --> 01:23:10.165
If you can stop,
yes, please, stop.

01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:15.570
And I want to help you.

01:23:17.272 --> 01:23:19.474
But I'm just trying
to help myself too.

01:23:29.619 --> 01:23:33.055
I wanna be your friend, Gus.
Will you be my friend?

01:23:35.425 --> 01:23:37.827
My fucking face
always betrays me.

01:23:46.604 --> 01:23:48.805
I can give you a ride
to... to the city.

01:23:53.478 --> 01:23:57.213
- I got a train ticket.
- What about to the station?

01:24:02.786 --> 01:24:05.420
- Cab's on its way, so...
- <i> Okay.</i>

01:24:10.894 --> 01:24:12.295
It would be more fun
to ride with me.

01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:15.131
Yeah, no shit.

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:17.266
But I'd never get
where I'm going.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.942
What are you looking for?

01:25:54.944 --> 01:25:57.110
What am I looking for?
