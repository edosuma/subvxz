00:00.410 --> 00:02.846
Evening, ladies.
Gals' night out?

00:02.847 --> 00:05.336
Chasing guys, eating pie,
having fun.

00:05.456 --> 00:10.457
This table is sticky!
Run a damp rag across it!

00:10.577 --> 00:12.122
Would it kill you
to clean a little?

00:12.123 --> 00:13.690
What kinda place is this?

00:13.691 --> 00:16.036
The kind that serves soup cold.

00:16.155 --> 00:18.157
And what's with
your crazy earrings?

00:18.158 --> 00:20.059
What are you, some kinda gypsy?

00:20.060 --> 00:22.361
Whoa!
Hold up, ladies.

00:22.362 --> 00:24.464
You don't get a bitch pass
just 'cause you're old.

00:26.900 --> 00:29.801
Yes, that's right.
I said it.

00:29.802 --> 00:32.070
You come in here with
your gangster granny attitude,

00:32.070 --> 00:33.805
think you can get away

00:33.806 --> 00:35.974
with dumping all over
the lowly gypsy waitress.

00:35.975 --> 00:39.210
No way. At this diner, we don't
discriminate due to age.

00:39.211 --> 00:40.712
If you're gonna act
like an ass,

00:40.713 --> 00:43.214
I'm gonna treat you
like an ass...

00:43.215 --> 00:48.586
No matter how close that ass
is riding to the floor.

00:48.587 --> 00:53.056
Now, I'll wipe off the table
we'll take it from the top.

00:53.057 --> 00:56.527
Hi, I'm Max.
Who wants tapioca?

00:57.963 --> 00:59.729
That's more like it.

00:59.730 --> 01:01.712
Save the disappointment
for the grandkids.

01:02.965 --> 01:12.862
Synced by YesCool
www.addic7ed.com

01:14.008 --> 01:16.025
Earl, I need another book
of checks.

01:16.145 --> 01:18.380
The last one fell between
the refrigerator and the oven.

01:18.381 --> 01:20.115
I'd reach for it,
but that falls between

01:20.116 --> 01:22.176
"I don't do that"
and "Oh, hell no."

01:23.442 --> 01:27.056
Look overthere, Max.
Men and women in suits.

01:27.234 --> 01:29.418
This neighborhood is
definitely on the rise.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.053
I remember a time when a black man

01:31.055 --> 01:32.721
couldn't get a cab around here.

01:32.723 --> 01:35.774
And that time was Wednesday.

01:35.776 --> 01:38.877
Max, I was just talking to
the smart couples in booth two.

01:38.879 --> 01:41.080
I know they're smart because
they're the first people in here

01:41.082 --> 01:42.614
who ever ordered the croque monsieur

01:42.616 --> 01:46.101
as croque monsieur and
not "crock monster."

01:48.388 --> 01:50.105
They wanna meet the woman
who made the cupcakes.

01:50.107 --> 01:51.606
I told them you'd be right over.

01:51.608 --> 01:54.043
- Go! They're so nice.
- No, they're not nice.

01:54.045 --> 01:56.161
They're trendy, blood-sucking locusts

01:56.163 --> 01:58.414
who come into this neighborhood
to pillage and destroy

01:58.416 --> 01:59.548
everything I care about.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.783
I felt the same way
when the Hilton sisters

02:01.785 --> 02:04.219
crashed my 21st birthday.

02:04.221 --> 02:07.556
What?

02:07.558 --> 02:09.425
You made these cupcakes?

02:09.426 --> 02:12.761
Yeah, what's the problem?
Spit it out, I've got a life.

02:12.763 --> 02:15.764
We just wanted to tell you
that your flavor palate is...

02:15.766 --> 02:17.299
amazing.

02:17.301 --> 02:19.568
I don't know who you are
or where you came from--

02:19.570 --> 02:21.603
Neither do I.

02:21.605 --> 02:24.356
But these are fabulous.

02:24.358 --> 02:27.242
Well, welcome to the neighborhood.

02:27.244 --> 02:28.744
I knew I liked you guys.

02:31.164 --> 02:33.615
So what did the trendy locusts want?

02:33.617 --> 02:36.318
You are so judgmental, you know that?

02:36.320 --> 02:39.788
They wanted to tell me the
cupcakes are "fabulous."

02:39.790 --> 02:40.956
Thank you.

02:40.958 --> 02:42.458
Maybe now you'll finally start to get it

02:42.460 --> 02:44.710
if someone besides me
tells you how good they are.

02:44.712 --> 02:48.097
I believe the word was "fabulous."

02:48.099 --> 02:49.932
Pick up, Max.

02:49.934 --> 02:52.501
Oleg, from now on, you
may call me Countess Max

02:52.503 --> 02:54.303
of the Fabulous Cupcakes.

02:54.305 --> 02:55.771
And you may call me Sir Oleg

02:55.773 --> 02:59.858
of the Amazing Party in My Pants.

03:03.596 --> 03:05.814
Caroline, the happy,
shiny people in suits

03:05.816 --> 03:07.483
asked me to give you this note.

03:07.485 --> 03:09.485
Oh, what a great idea!

03:09.487 --> 03:11.353
They suggested we sell Max's cupcakes

03:11.355 --> 03:13.572
at the cool new coffee
place in their building.

03:13.574 --> 03:17.242
But you already sell
cupcakes here in my diner.

03:17.244 --> 03:19.694
Han, we're building a cupcake
business that will one day

03:19.696 --> 03:20.996
get us out of here.

03:20.998 --> 03:22.714
That's what we're trying
to do with our lives.

03:22.716 --> 03:27.202
But I thought we
had something special.

03:27.204 --> 03:29.704
Yes, but we're not exclusive.

03:29.706 --> 03:33.675
The diner's cute, but
I want more than this.

03:33.677 --> 03:35.694
Oof.

03:35.696 --> 03:38.430
First girlfriend all over again.

03:39.514 --> 03:39.514
+

03:42.962 --> 03:44.162
Hey, Johnny.

03:44.164 --> 03:45.330
Max has the tables against the wall.

03:45.332 --> 03:46.932
Oh, we're good in your section.

03:46.934 --> 03:51.453
Caroline, I want you
to meet my buddy Carlos.

03:51.455 --> 03:53.788
Hi.

03:53.790 --> 03:56.308
Well, I'm working the counter.

03:56.310 --> 03:57.876
What's happenin'? Come on, dude.

03:57.878 --> 03:59.561
You have a literature degree from NYU.

03:59.563 --> 04:01.396
I didn't mean to say
that, but when I get nervous,

04:01.398 --> 04:03.131
my Rico Suave comes out.

04:03.133 --> 04:05.633
It won't happen again.

04:05.635 --> 04:07.102
And here's two menus.

04:07.104 --> 04:10.739
What's happenin'?

04:10.741 --> 04:13.692
Dude, I'm nervous.

04:13.694 --> 04:15.477
Hey, guys, I'm in
that section over there.

04:15.479 --> 04:17.279
Oh, we're good in Caroline's area.

04:17.281 --> 04:20.248
Well, if you like hot
coffee in your pants area,

04:20.250 --> 04:22.250
you're in the right place.

04:22.252 --> 04:24.836
Actually, I like that.

04:24.838 --> 04:27.822
Coming right at you.

04:30.176 --> 04:31.493
Johnny's in your section.

04:31.495 --> 04:32.627
Yeah, why?

04:32.629 --> 04:34.212
He comes in here every night to see you.

04:34.214 --> 04:36.098
He's your friends
or...crush or whatever he is.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.833
Shh! He's not a crush. He's a...

04:38.835 --> 04:40.135
I don't know what he
is, but whatever he is,

04:40.137 --> 04:43.505
he's in your section.

04:46.008 --> 04:47.893
- Max!
- Ooh! What are you doing?

04:47.895 --> 04:49.111
You're not supposed to be in here.

04:49.113 --> 04:52.814
I know, I'm a bad boy.

04:52.816 --> 04:54.866
Look, the reason I'm not
sitting in your section

04:54.868 --> 04:57.786
is because my buddy Carlos is
crushing pretty hard on Caroline

04:57.788 --> 04:59.621
and he asked me to do
what I can to hook them up.

04:59.623 --> 05:01.990
Oh. So now you're a bartender,

05:01.992 --> 05:03.858
a street artist, and a pimp.

05:03.860 --> 05:06.545
Ain't nuttin' wrong with me
pimpin' some boy on the side.

05:06.547 --> 05:08.997
Keeps me in spray paint and whatnot.

05:08.999 --> 05:10.549
So?

05:10.551 --> 05:14.202
From pimp to pimp...

05:14.204 --> 05:15.720
Help me out with your girl.

05:15.722 --> 05:19.891
My girl don't come cheap.

05:20.943 --> 05:25.230
Is it hot in here?

05:26.032 --> 05:28.266
Yes, and we're in a freezer.

05:28.268 --> 05:31.052
Yes. My freezer.

05:31.054 --> 05:33.888
I was, uh, just talking to Max.

05:33.890 --> 05:37.025
Um, I'll see you out there.

05:40.947 --> 05:45.116
So is this what you like in the men?

05:45.118 --> 05:48.170
No. He's just a
customer that went rogue.

05:48.172 --> 05:51.239
He is weak and girlish.

05:51.241 --> 05:53.792
A woman like you needs a real man.

05:53.794 --> 05:55.010
You know what they say.

05:55.012 --> 05:59.014
Once you go Ukraine, you
will scream with sex pain.

06:03.302 --> 06:05.971
That probably lost
some of its sensual appeal

06:05.973 --> 06:09.524
in the translation, but
thanks for the offer, Oleg.

06:11.777 --> 06:15.363
Cute, but I'm not interested.
Besides, he's not my type.

06:15.365 --> 06:16.815
Just say it.

06:16.817 --> 06:19.234
You're not interested in him
because he's Puerto Rican.

06:19.236 --> 06:20.569
Where did you get this idea

06:20.571 --> 06:22.070
that I would only date white guys?

06:22.072 --> 06:25.207
For your information, I've
dated all kinds of men.

06:25.209 --> 06:28.193
I once had a Spaniard in Monte Carlo.

06:28.195 --> 06:30.879
Isn't the title of an Abba song?

06:30.881 --> 06:33.965
Are you sure about this? He's cute.

06:33.967 --> 06:37.952
And trust me, you could use a
little salsa in your white rice.

06:37.954 --> 06:40.088
Max, I just lost every dollar I had.

06:40.090 --> 06:42.474
The last thing on my
mind right now is guys--

06:42.476 --> 06:44.643
<i>any type of guy.</i>

06:44.645 --> 06:46.511
Except this guy.

06:46.513 --> 06:48.313
Hi, Chestnut.

06:48.315 --> 06:51.016
I'm much more concerned
with our business

06:51.018 --> 06:52.817
and getting my head back above water.

06:52.819 --> 06:54.653
Men will come sooner or later.

06:54.655 --> 06:59.574
Well, according to my
research most men come sooner.

06:59.576 --> 07:00.825
Oh, I thought we should stop by

07:00.827 --> 07:02.611
that new coffee place tomorrow
and introduce ourselves

07:02.613 --> 07:04.112
and your cupcakes.

07:04.114 --> 07:06.581
I'm not gonna walk in there.
I feel like I'm selling out.

07:06.583 --> 07:09.751
Okay, let's reframe
the phrase selling out

07:09.753 --> 07:11.453
and make it sold out,

07:11.455 --> 07:13.622
as in "Max, we sold out of the cupcakes"

07:13.624 --> 07:15.257
and are now successful."

07:15.259 --> 07:16.625
What's that you say?

07:16.627 --> 07:19.511
I can now afford to buy
the wax dental floss again?

07:19.513 --> 07:21.513
Fine.

07:21.515 --> 07:23.498
But I'm only doing it so
you'll eventually get your mind

07:23.500 --> 07:24.966
off the business and get laid.

07:24.968 --> 07:27.102
Why do you think I
need to get laid so badly?

07:27.104 --> 07:29.638
If I'd just gone through
all the tension and trauma

07:29.640 --> 07:31.273
that just happened to you,

07:31.275 --> 07:33.224
I'd be climbing telephone
polls to take the edge off.

07:33.226 --> 07:36.695
Trust me, sex is the last
thing on my mind right now.

07:36.697 --> 07:39.114
Oh, and speaking of reframing things,

07:39.116 --> 07:40.699
I have a surprise.

07:40.701 --> 07:42.200
I redecorated my room.

07:42.202 --> 07:44.653
I scoped out some cheap
fabric in bedding places

07:44.655 --> 07:46.571
down on Houston Street.

07:46.573 --> 07:50.458
What do you think?

07:50.460 --> 07:53.995
I think you've made a vagina.

07:56.332 --> 07:57.582
What?

07:57.584 --> 08:01.136
Sister, you may think
that sex is the last thing

08:01.138 --> 08:05.006
on your mind, but you turned
your bed into a vagina.

08:06.092 --> 08:07.759
Do you think my vagina has curtains?

08:07.761 --> 08:11.680
I don't know how long it's been.

08:11.682 --> 08:13.515
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

08:13.517 --> 08:14.716
Okay, but I still
have to make the cupcakes

08:14.718 --> 08:16.184
to bring by that place tomorrow.

08:16.186 --> 08:17.552
I don't wanna keep you awake

08:17.554 --> 08:18.903
so why don't you sleep in my bed tonight

08:18.905 --> 08:20.605
and I'll pass out on your vagina?

08:20.607 --> 08:24.242
Okay, but you better buy
me breakfast in the morning.

08:29.565 --> 08:33.183
I love this place. Looks
like Paris in the '20s.

08:33.186 --> 08:36.453
More like poseurs in their 20s.

08:36.456 --> 08:38.423
Man, they've really
cleaned this place up.

08:38.424 --> 08:40.125
You've been here before?

08:40.126 --> 08:41.458
Yeah, it used to be a liquor store

08:41.461 --> 08:42.626
owned by this old Irish guy

08:42.629 --> 08:45.213
who had freckles on his penis.

08:45.215 --> 08:47.081
Sometimes he'd corner you and flash it,

08:47.083 --> 08:49.751
but then he'd always comp
you a free lotto ticket.

08:49.753 --> 08:51.052
Okay, well, let's try and keep

08:51.054 --> 08:52.587
that sort of charming nostalgia

08:52.589 --> 08:54.305
out of our sales pitch.

08:54.307 --> 08:56.274
Oh, that's the owner.

08:56.276 --> 08:57.776
I scoped it out before you got here.

08:57.778 --> 08:59.861
And remember, I'll do the talking.

08:59.863 --> 09:01.029
Why don't I get to talk?

09:01.031 --> 09:03.732
Freckled penis.

09:03.734 --> 09:05.066
And besides, I have more experience.

09:05.068 --> 09:07.118
All those who pitched business
models to Warren Buffett

09:07.120 --> 09:09.103
as a member of the Phillips
Exeter Entrepreneurs Club

09:09.105 --> 09:11.939
raise their hands. Holla!

09:11.941 --> 09:14.275
Well, if you care enough
to raise your arms about it,

09:14.277 --> 09:17.295
fine. You talk. I won't say anything.

09:17.297 --> 09:20.248
Hi, what can I get for you?

09:20.250 --> 09:23.451
Hi, I'm Caroline and this
is my business partner Max.

09:23.453 --> 09:25.253
- And you are?
- Semhar.

09:25.255 --> 09:27.806
- Oh, jeez.
- Such a pretty name.

09:27.808 --> 09:30.592
It means "light of
the tiger" in Sanskrit.

09:30.594 --> 09:32.177
Oh, jeez.

09:32.179 --> 09:33.795
It's my yoga name.

09:33.797 --> 09:35.980
Help me, God.

09:35.982 --> 09:37.732
Well, Semhar, we just opened

09:37.734 --> 09:39.651
a local neighborhood cupcake company.

09:39.653 --> 09:40.769
Our card.

09:40.771 --> 09:42.570
We're introducing our exciting product

09:42.572 --> 09:43.822
to local boulangeries.

09:43.824 --> 09:46.474
Please try a sample. Max.

09:46.476 --> 09:48.743
Would you like
coconut-coffee, chocolate-curry,

09:48.745 --> 09:50.829
or blueberry-lemon zest?

09:50.831 --> 09:53.114
My absolute fave is the coconut-coffee.

09:53.116 --> 09:54.365
Let's start with that, shall we?

09:54.367 --> 09:58.336
Thank you, but no thank you.

09:58.338 --> 10:00.789
Well, can I ask you why?

10:00.791 --> 10:03.458
They're not pretty enough.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.926
Excuse me?

10:04.928 --> 10:07.962
They're not pretty enough.

10:07.964 --> 10:10.131
Perhaps if you tried one,

10:10.133 --> 10:12.434
you'd see how amazing
our flavor palate is.

10:12.436 --> 10:14.602
Hold off, Flava Flav.

10:14.604 --> 10:16.221
What do you mean,
they're not pretty enough?

10:16.223 --> 10:19.190
They have a charming homemade look,

10:19.192 --> 10:20.558
but my customer would prefer

10:20.560 --> 10:23.027
a more upscale, prettier product.

10:23.029 --> 10:25.697
Just FYI, some upscale residents

10:25.699 --> 10:27.398
in this very upscale building

10:27.400 --> 10:29.200
where your upscale
store actually is located

10:29.202 --> 10:31.185
recently told us they were fabulous.

10:31.187 --> 10:33.037
I understand.

10:33.039 --> 10:35.290
But they're not pretty enough.

10:35.292 --> 10:37.992
Listen, battlefield earth.

10:42.414 --> 10:45.250
This is Williamsburg, Brooklyn,

10:45.252 --> 10:47.201
and no amount of exposed brick and paint

10:47.203 --> 10:50.138
can change the fact that,
right where you're standing,

10:50.140 --> 10:52.373
I've seen Tommy O'Hanlon's wing-wang

10:52.375 --> 10:54.309
more times than I care to remember.

10:54.311 --> 10:57.645
And I must say, it was way less
offensive than your attitude.

10:57.647 --> 10:59.814
And you can shove that up your upscale.

10:59.816 --> 11:02.684
Let's go.

11:02.686 --> 11:04.602
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

11:07.594 --> 11:07.594
+

11:11.607 --> 11:13.124
What's with the empty hands, Max?

11:13.126 --> 11:14.525
No cupcakes tonight?

11:14.527 --> 11:17.061
No, they're bugging me. I
decided to take the night off.

11:17.063 --> 11:19.180
Be careful with decisions like that.

11:19.182 --> 11:22.283
In 1987, I took a night off
from earth, wind, and fire

11:22.285 --> 11:26.371
and the next day, they
earth, wind, and fired my ass.

11:29.325 --> 11:31.409
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

11:31.411 --> 11:33.828
Mid-afternoon nap in your vagina?

11:33.830 --> 11:35.696
I wish! No.

11:35.698 --> 11:37.882
I went to a cheap bakery
supply store in Greenpoint

11:37.884 --> 11:39.300
and got us some supplies.

11:39.302 --> 11:40.551
Here.

11:40.553 --> 11:42.303
It's the basic cake decorating kit.

11:42.305 --> 11:44.005
And best of all I found us a fun,

11:44.007 --> 11:46.140
reasonable two-session
cupcake decorating class

11:46.142 --> 11:47.308
at a bakery.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.143
We can learn how to make pretty roses.

11:49.145 --> 11:50.345
No way.

11:50.347 --> 11:51.846
The cupcakes don't need to be pretty.

11:51.848 --> 11:54.548
They compensate by having
a great sense of humor.

11:54.550 --> 11:57.685
Pretty cupcakes is just
another option for our business.

11:57.687 --> 11:58.903
People want pretty, we do pretty.

11:58.905 --> 12:01.272
Or people want
homemade, we do--

12:01.274 --> 12:04.659
- Wait, where is our homemade?
- I didn't make any tonight.

12:04.661 --> 12:06.661
You didn't make any?

12:06.663 --> 12:08.946
What, you get one piece
of constructive criticism

12:08.948 --> 12:11.282
and you stop making them?

12:11.284 --> 12:13.051
Max, it's business.

12:13.053 --> 12:15.203
And maybe Semhar has a point
about making them pretty.

12:15.205 --> 12:17.288
First of all, what does
she know about pretty?

12:17.290 --> 12:20.574
The woman has dreadlocks.

12:20.576 --> 12:22.410
Her head looks like the stuff

12:22.412 --> 12:23.928
you empty out of a vacuum cleaner bag.

12:23.930 --> 12:25.096
Not pretty.

12:25.098 --> 12:27.432
Forget her.

12:27.434 --> 12:28.766
What's happening with you?

12:28.768 --> 12:30.418
What's your problem with pretty?

12:30.420 --> 12:35.223
<i>Don't wave your
divas live hand at me.</i>

12:35.225 --> 12:37.141
I just think society's way too concerned

12:37.143 --> 12:38.976
with other people's
idea of what's pretty.

12:38.978 --> 12:41.595
You don't think you can do it.

12:41.597 --> 12:43.097
That's what this is about.

12:43.099 --> 12:44.315
This isn't about society.

12:44.317 --> 12:45.733
You're afraid you can't do pretty.

12:45.735 --> 12:47.485
Look, I don't do pretty

12:47.487 --> 12:49.871
the way you don't do Puerto Ricans.

12:49.873 --> 12:51.656
What are you talking about?

12:51.658 --> 12:53.491
I'll do Puerto Ricans.

12:53.493 --> 12:54.942
All right.

12:54.944 --> 12:57.578
Then go do one and leave me alone.

12:57.580 --> 13:00.631
Max, it's a skill. That's all.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.667
It's not shameful to not
know how to do something.

13:02.669 --> 13:05.253
Didn't you have piano
lessons growing up?

13:05.255 --> 13:07.372
Seriously?

13:07.374 --> 13:09.223
Ice skating?

13:09.225 --> 13:11.476
Closest I've come to blades on ice

13:11.478 --> 13:12.927
was when a pregnant
girl pulled a knife on me

13:12.929 --> 13:14.679
at a hockey game.

13:14.681 --> 13:16.731
Look, you and I have a business,

13:16.733 --> 13:18.599
and this is a skill we need.

13:18.601 --> 13:20.435
We're going to that class

13:20.437 --> 13:22.019
and we are gonna master
how to make pretty roses.

13:22.021 --> 13:23.637
And I know how much you
hate anything trendy,

13:23.639 --> 13:26.991
so I found us a family-owned
Italian bakery in Brooklyn.

13:26.993 --> 13:28.693
Italian's good.

13:28.695 --> 13:30.078
Maybe they'll know how to dump the body

13:30.080 --> 13:31.362
after I kill you.

13:35.667 --> 13:39.454
First of all, welcome
to Spice and Sugar.

13:39.456 --> 13:42.340
We did a little twist on the
traditional sugar and spice

13:42.342 --> 13:44.625
putting spice first because...

13:44.627 --> 13:47.345
We're Italian.

13:47.347 --> 13:49.046
And we always got the spice up front

13:49.048 --> 13:50.498
and a little in the rear.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.550
Holla!

13:52.552 --> 13:55.770
Now are you embarrassed
you ever said holla?

13:55.772 --> 13:58.839
My name is Stephanie, and
this is my cousin Serena,

13:58.841 --> 14:01.309
and this bakery has been
in our family for years

14:01.311 --> 14:03.644
and then we took it over and made it...

14:03.646 --> 14:07.031
Hot.

14:07.033 --> 14:08.733
All right, let's go around
and introduce ourselves

14:08.735 --> 14:10.451
and tell us why you came tonight.

14:10.453 --> 14:12.036
Let's start with the cute guys.

14:12.038 --> 14:14.522
Always!

14:14.524 --> 14:16.023
I'm Steve, I thought this would be

14:16.025 --> 14:17.825
a fun idea for my bachelor party.

14:17.827 --> 14:20.828
I'm getting married to
Michael...right there.

14:20.830 --> 14:22.580
So cute. God bless!

14:22.582 --> 14:23.697
And I'm Michael.

14:23.699 --> 14:27.802
- I'm Michael as well.
- Michael.

14:27.804 --> 14:31.305
Oh...So many Michaels.

14:31.307 --> 14:34.208
- And you are?
- Michael.

14:34.210 --> 14:35.343
No, I'm Max.

14:35.345 --> 14:38.262
Oh, she's funny. So cute, God bless!

14:38.264 --> 14:40.565
And I'm Caroline. I'm Max's partner.

14:40.567 --> 14:43.651
- Oh, so many gays tonight.
- I know.

14:43.653 --> 14:46.020
No, I'm her business partner.

14:46.022 --> 14:48.606
We actually have our own cupcake
business over in Williamsburg,

14:48.608 --> 14:50.908
and I must say, we're doing very well.

14:50.910 --> 14:53.277
Max is the baker and
I'm the business head

14:53.279 --> 14:55.196
and we're here tonight to
increase our skill level

14:55.198 --> 14:57.231
and take our business
up to a level that's...

14:57.233 --> 15:00.034
<i>Hot as well.</i>

15:00.036 --> 15:01.402
If you're gonna talk that much,

15:01.404 --> 15:04.905
no one will have time to learn anything.

15:04.907 --> 15:06.424
I know, right?

15:06.426 --> 15:07.908
So, uh, where's your shop?

15:07.910 --> 15:10.744
Well, right now, we're just
working out of our apartment.

15:10.746 --> 15:12.763
- So no shop.
- Oh, that's sweet.

15:12.765 --> 15:15.600
- Cute.
- Yeah, good luck, God bless.

15:15.602 --> 15:18.019
Can you say jealous?

15:18.021 --> 15:19.437
All right, let's start simple

15:19.439 --> 15:20.638
with a pretty little icing flower.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.756
Everybody pick up your piping bags,

15:22.758 --> 15:24.392
and with a
straight-edge tip--

15:24.394 --> 15:27.612
But you guys can use your gay-edge tip.

15:27.614 --> 15:30.731
All right, everybody watch Stephanie.

15:30.733 --> 15:31.983
You're gonna take the nail head

15:31.985 --> 15:33.150
and you're gonna make a little "U"

15:33.152 --> 15:34.202
so that you get little petals.

15:34.204 --> 15:35.486
And we'll do this five times.

15:35.488 --> 15:37.738
And then, you have a pretty
little five-petal flower.

15:37.740 --> 15:41.292
- Simple.
- So cute. How fun!

15:41.294 --> 15:43.961
No, no. You gotta
start by making a "U".

15:43.963 --> 15:45.329
I did. That's a "U".

15:45.331 --> 15:50.218
- Serena, is that a "U"?
- Not a "U".

15:50.220 --> 15:52.403
Fine, I'll start over.

15:52.405 --> 15:53.971
That was a "U".

15:53.973 --> 15:55.840
And what, just because I
don't have a quote-unquote shop

15:55.842 --> 15:57.225
I don't know a "U"?

15:57.227 --> 15:58.392
What's with the attitude?

15:58.394 --> 15:59.793
All right, let's leave.

15:59.795 --> 16:01.846
Next time the gays giggle,
we'll just slide out.

16:01.848 --> 16:04.315
No, we're here to learn.

16:04.317 --> 16:05.799
That looks good.

16:05.801 --> 16:07.852
I suck. I'm starting over.

16:07.854 --> 16:09.987
Max, why'd you do that? It was good.

16:09.989 --> 16:11.239
Not good enough.

16:11.241 --> 16:12.823
You two not done yet?

16:12.825 --> 16:14.992
You have to master the little flower,

16:14.994 --> 16:17.328
or when we move on to
roses you'll be screwed.

16:17.330 --> 16:19.480
- Right, cuz?
- Oh, totally screwed.

16:19.482 --> 16:22.617
Screwed and not in the good way.

16:22.619 --> 16:24.535
Do you think we can convince them

16:24.537 --> 16:28.489
that slapping each other's
face is the new high five?

16:29.841 --> 16:33.044
Steve, oh, my God.
That rose is gorgeous.

16:33.046 --> 16:34.512
Good for you.

16:34.514 --> 16:37.498
All right, one more minute
and we'll display our roses.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.968
Psst. Steve. Little help.

16:40.970 --> 16:45.139
I choke at timed tests. I
got like a 40 on my SATs.

16:45.141 --> 16:47.808
Damn it, Steve!

16:47.810 --> 16:49.060
Look at this place.

16:49.062 --> 16:50.311
There's no way these girls

16:50.313 --> 16:52.480
could have this much cupcake
success in this economy.

16:52.482 --> 16:54.649
I mean, the overhead
on this building alone--

16:54.651 --> 16:55.866
What are you saying?

16:55.868 --> 16:57.184
Not saying mob money,

16:57.186 --> 16:58.852
just saying maybe we'd have a shop too

16:58.854 --> 17:00.538
- if we had mob money.
- Shh.

17:00.540 --> 17:01.822
Keep it down.

17:01.824 --> 17:03.457
You wanna wake up tomorrow
with Chestnut's head

17:03.459 --> 17:06.077
in your vagina bed?

17:06.079 --> 17:09.646
Okay, time's up.
Let's see what you got.

17:09.648 --> 17:11.882
What is that? There's
like nothing there.

17:11.884 --> 17:13.000
That's not a rose.

17:13.002 --> 17:15.636
- It's minimalist.
- Whatev.

17:15.637 --> 17:17.922
No, not "whatev". It's brilliant.

17:17.924 --> 17:20.374
And I would know because,
when I was in Tokyo,

17:20.376 --> 17:22.510
I had a private Japanese
flower arranging class

17:22.512 --> 17:24.845
with the head of the Ikebana institute.

17:24.847 --> 17:26.347
And he said I had a gift.

17:26.348 --> 17:33.053
In his words,
"Caroline..."

17:34.656 --> 17:37.158
Whatev. Okay, what
about your friend there?

17:37.160 --> 17:39.026
I kinda ran out of time.

17:39.028 --> 17:40.745
You had 20 minutes.

17:40.747 --> 17:42.229
I thought she said you were the baker.

17:42.231 --> 17:45.232
No, you need to be able to whip
these out in like 20 seconds

17:45.234 --> 17:46.951
if you wanna be successful
in your little bakery.

17:46.953 --> 17:51.405
"Um, I'd like a cupcake."
"That'll be 12 hours."

17:51.407 --> 17:53.207
- Right?
- Right.

17:53.209 --> 17:54.759
And they have to be prettier than that.

17:54.761 --> 17:56.594
Well, maybe you'll
do better tomorrow.

17:56.596 --> 17:59.764
Remember. Your homework assignment

17:59.766 --> 18:03.384
is to bring in a cupcake
with a pretty rose on it.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.935
Right.

18:04.937 --> 18:06.253
Like we're gonna come back here

18:06.255 --> 18:10.107
and spend time with
these Robert de Nir-hos.

18:13.528 --> 18:16.197
Ugh! That one stinks too. Damn it!

18:18.067 --> 18:20.718
Max, forget it.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.703
It's 3:00 A.M.
Go to bed.

18:22.705 --> 18:24.488
Don't. Don't say anything to me.

18:24.490 --> 18:26.374
I am so mad at you right now.

18:26.376 --> 18:28.509
- What did I do?
- Everything.

18:28.511 --> 18:30.077
I used to love making cupcakes.

18:30.079 --> 18:31.945
It was the one thing
I could zone out and do

18:31.947 --> 18:33.130
without thinking.

18:33.132 --> 18:34.498
And now all I'm doing is thinking.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.500
Thinking that I stink
at making cupcakes.

18:36.502 --> 18:37.951
Well, stop it.

18:37.953 --> 18:42.139
Who cares what they think?
They're bitchy baking bullies.

18:42.141 --> 18:43.808
We don't have to go back there.

18:43.810 --> 18:45.292
Oh, and then what?

18:45.294 --> 18:46.927
I'm gonna think my
cupcakes weren't good enough

18:46.929 --> 18:48.179
for the rest of my life?

18:48.181 --> 18:50.648
You said we need the skill,
then we need the skill.

18:50.650 --> 18:53.100
I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a quitter.

18:53.102 --> 18:56.136
I'm gonna make a stupid,
pretty cupcake if it kills me.

18:56.138 --> 18:58.355
Or you.

18:58.357 --> 19:00.107
And you are going back there with me.

19:00.109 --> 19:01.609
And we're gonna shove our pretty cupcake

19:01.611 --> 19:04.912
right up Snooki and her cousin's asses.

19:04.914 --> 19:07.748
Now, shut up, don't talk to me,

19:07.750 --> 19:11.702
and go back in your vagina.

19:11.704 --> 19:14.705
Sorry you had to see that, Chestnut.

19:16.746 --> 19:16.746
+

19:20.499 --> 19:22.467
Oh, not very pretty.

19:22.469 --> 19:24.569
But at least you tried, Michael.

19:24.571 --> 19:25.853
Just one question.

19:25.855 --> 19:28.089
Are you sure that you're gay?

19:32.161 --> 19:34.395
Oh, okay, Caroline.
Let's see your pretty rose.

19:34.397 --> 19:35.696
I didn't do one.

19:35.698 --> 19:36.998
Society is way too concerned
with other people's idea

19:37.000 --> 19:38.282
of what's pretty.

19:38.284 --> 19:40.368
Whatevs.

19:40.370 --> 19:41.953
Okay, what about your baker there?

19:41.955 --> 19:43.254
She bail too?

19:43.256 --> 19:45.739
No, here it is.

19:47.626 --> 19:50.094
- Mm-hmm. 
- Max, that's so pretty.

19:50.096 --> 19:52.096
I'm so proud of you.

19:52.098 --> 19:53.848
Good work, God bless. Good for you.

19:53.850 --> 19:55.183
How long did it take you?

19:55.185 --> 19:57.351
About three hours and 40 minutes.

19:57.353 --> 19:58.769
But I did it!

19:58.771 --> 20:00.521
I just wanted to prove to you and myself

20:00.523 --> 20:02.056
I can make something pretty.

20:02.058 --> 20:03.774
And now
that I have--

20:03.776 --> 20:04.775
Mm!

20:12.201 --> 20:15.536
That cupcake wasn't
me. I don't do pretty.

20:15.538 --> 20:18.122
But I did make each of you
a cupcake that I think says

20:18.124 --> 20:21.108
what I feel about this
whole cupcake class.

20:21.110 --> 20:25.079
This one says "Bite me".

20:25.081 --> 20:27.965
This one says "Screw U".

20:27.967 --> 20:30.668
You see that "U"? That's a "U".

20:30.670 --> 20:33.087
Holla!

20:38.343 --> 20:39.627
Well, good luck with that.

20:39.629 --> 20:43.898
People don't want
cupcakes that insult them.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.234
Oh, my God, Max. That's our thing.

20:46.236 --> 20:47.435
I was wrong. You were right.

20:47.437 --> 20:48.769
We don't need to make pretty cupcakes.

20:48.771 --> 20:50.021
Everybody does pretty.

20:50.023 --> 20:51.572
We have to do what you do best.

20:51.574 --> 20:54.575
Insult people.

20:54.577 --> 20:56.160
Yeah, who's gonna buy that?

20:56.162 --> 20:58.446
We will. For our shower.

20:58.448 --> 21:01.115
And really let us bitches have it!

21:08.323 --> 21:14.640
