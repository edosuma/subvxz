00:19.126 --> 00:20.994
This is it.

00:21.996 --> 00:23.829
It's not a bad size.

00:25.966 --> 00:29.502
It's a palace for a
colored man in this city.

00:29.703 --> 00:31.904
I think you'll find it comfortable.

00:32.139 --> 00:34.440
You didn't even tell your own mother?

00:40.880 --> 00:42.614
I didn't tell anyone.

00:42.748 --> 00:44.749
So I'm a secret, then?

00:44.984 --> 00:47.352
This must be very inconvenient for you.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.953
It's a wonderful surprise.

00:49.155 --> 00:50.522
(scoffs) You seem overjoyed.

00:56.762 --> 00:59.197
- Who is she, Algernon?
- Excuse me?

01:04.069 --> 01:05.670
A man...

01:09.608 --> 01:13.177
a man stops writing to his woman

01:13.278 --> 01:14.678
for two reasons.

01:16.915 --> 01:18.715
Either...

01:20.552 --> 01:22.086
he's dead...

01:27.225 --> 01:29.026
or he's moved on.

01:35.567 --> 01:37.601
You look very much alive to me.

01:42.274 --> 01:44.007
So?

01:46.945 --> 01:49.845
I did meet someone.

01:49.981 --> 01:51.847
Of course you did.

01:51.983 --> 01:53.583
I can almost picture her.

01:53.784 --> 01:56.453
But it was no meaningless affair.

01:57.788 --> 02:01.091
She became pregnant.

02:05.496 --> 02:08.931
And where are they now,
your girl and your baby?

02:09.100 --> 02:11.801
She terminated the pregnancy.

02:11.969 --> 02:13.970
She married someone else.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.806
And you still love her.

02:19.876 --> 02:21.743
I'm sorry.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.100
I should have written you these things

02:25.181 --> 02:26.448
so that you knew to move on.

02:26.816 --> 02:29.784
Could have saved you the time
and the expense of coming here.

02:29.952 --> 02:31.386
I will pay for all of it,

02:31.621 --> 02:34.423
your return and any divorce fees.

02:37.193 --> 02:40.395
Did you really think you
could run me off so easily?

02:42.832 --> 02:45.300
I have never let anyone tell
me when it's time to walk away

02:45.468 --> 02:47.502
and you are no exception.

02:49.005 --> 02:51.006
I'm staying

02:51.173 --> 02:54.275
and I'm keeping what's mine.

02:59.381 --> 03:02.117
I assume you only have
one bed in your palace?

03:05.421 --> 03:09.457
Don't expect to experience any
wonderful surprises any time soon.

03:13.695 --> 03:15.863
(kissing)

03:18.232 --> 03:19.900
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:20.001 --> 03:21.769
(laughs)

03:21.937 --> 03:24.504
Daisy: Let's kiss some more.

03:24.606 --> 03:26.173
Kissing was fun.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.709
Oh, we will, we will. I promise.

03:28.944 --> 03:31.611
But this will be fun
as well, I promise.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.547
Okay.

03:34.916 --> 03:36.950
What is that thing anyway?

03:37.185 --> 03:41.354
This is a little bit of magic in a box.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.492
Now, if you wouldn't
mind standing, please.

03:47.095 --> 03:48.662
(chuckles)

03:53.067 --> 03:56.403
And if you wouldn't mind

03:56.604 --> 03:58.672
removing your clothes, please.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.674
(laughs) What?

04:00.874 --> 04:03.677
- Henry!
- It's just in good fun.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.246
So I'll have you with me always.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.082
Go on, Daisy. I dare you.

04:11.284 --> 04:12.985
That's it.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.188
- (laughs)
- That's great.

04:15.322 --> 04:18.290
(camera clicking)

04:18.391 --> 04:20.927
(grunting)

04:30.070 --> 04:32.205
Yes!

04:32.305 --> 04:34.573
Good girl.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.448
So once the pig's temperature
reached 107 Fahrenheit,

04:43.650 --> 04:45.416
it killed off all the spirochete.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.352
Every last one in her system.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.788
I then gave her a large
injection of quinine

04:49.989 --> 04:52.290
and very soon the malaria fever broke.

04:52.424 --> 04:53.959
She survived?

04:54.193 --> 04:57.095
Happily rolling around
in her pen when I left.

04:57.263 --> 05:00.232
But, John, that's a pig.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.200
How could you be certain
it'll work on me?

05:02.201 --> 05:04.202
No, syphilis has the same characteristics

05:04.370 --> 05:06.371
no matter who or what it lives in.

05:08.340 --> 05:10.341
So you want to cook me?

05:10.442 --> 05:11.843
Essentially.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.746
I mean, a pig's normal
temperature is 102.

05:14.847 --> 05:17.582
Ours is 98.

05:17.849 --> 05:20.652
You know, raising her five
degrees was somewhat easier.

05:20.852 --> 05:23.254
I'd have to raise you close to nine.

05:26.325 --> 05:29.661
John, how can you be certain that
won't kill me in the process?

05:29.828 --> 05:31.896
No, no, it's a risk, I know,

05:32.064 --> 05:33.631
but I'll be with you the whole time

05:33.999 --> 05:36.619
and I'll be ready to inject you
if the fever starts to take you.

05:38.237 --> 05:39.870
I don't know.

05:39.971 --> 05:41.472
Abby.

05:41.674 --> 05:45.008
Abby, this is a chance to cure you.

05:45.243 --> 05:48.244
You know, it would give
you your life back.

05:48.546 --> 05:51.581
But can you be sure it won't
take my life instead?

05:55.253 --> 05:57.654
No.

05:57.722 --> 05:59.456
I can't.

05:59.691 --> 06:02.058
<i>- (clock ticking)
- Mays: My father...</i>

06:02.260 --> 06:04.127
tended to Secretary of State Seward

06:04.329 --> 06:06.763
on the night Lincoln was shot.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.832
Did you know he was attacked, too?

06:08.933 --> 06:10.300
Nurse: I didn't.

06:10.501 --> 06:12.669
Stabbed by a rogue Confederate.

06:15.405 --> 06:18.006
Old Dad was...

06:18.275 --> 06:21.477
doing exactly what I'm
attempting right now.

06:21.712 --> 06:23.879
Back then you had to rely on your wits.

06:34.858 --> 06:37.493
"Draw the cricoid forward,

06:37.728 --> 06:39.661
keeping the trachea steady and tense."

06:41.131 --> 06:42.865
Tenaculum, please.

06:45.568 --> 06:47.635
<i>I've noticed you in the halls.</i>

06:47.904 --> 06:51.340
I'm new. Mr. Robertson
hired me two weeks ago.

06:51.574 --> 06:53.608
Her larynx is moving around too much.

06:53.810 --> 06:55.577
Let's give her a little more ether.

07:03.485 --> 07:05.853
When I started in practice,

07:06.088 --> 07:08.384
each surgeon picked out
his favorite nurse

07:08.385 --> 07:10.553
and asked her to be exclusive to him

07:10.687 --> 07:12.054
in the operating room.

07:12.188 --> 07:14.423
I've heard that.

07:14.691 --> 07:17.359
No shortage of them
ended up getting married.

07:19.530 --> 07:20.897
Surgical knife.

07:28.103 --> 07:30.539
Damn it. Where's the cauterizer?

07:30.606 --> 07:32.173
Here.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.976
I'd be happy to have you assigned to me.

07:35.144 --> 07:38.379
You'd be mine, so to speak.

07:38.781 --> 07:42.183
I could be very helpful in securing a
long future for you here at the Knick.

07:46.255 --> 07:48.656
- (screams)
- (Mays groaning)

07:52.561 --> 07:54.295
Effie: <i>The flower arrangements</i>

07:54.496 --> 07:57.265
<i>should definitely have blue in them.</i>

07:57.599 --> 08:00.768
<i>The color would be beautiful
with the napkins we've chosen.</i>

08:01.070 --> 08:03.304
Woman: Though we have to be
sure it's the right blue.

08:03.505 --> 08:05.606
It would be awful to have them clash.

08:05.740 --> 08:08.241
Yes, it would.

08:08.477 --> 08:10.945
Should we match the
flowers to the napkins

08:11.112 --> 08:13.714
or the napkins to the flowers?

08:15.249 --> 08:17.084
Cornelia?

08:19.253 --> 08:21.822
Napkins to the flowers.

08:21.990 --> 08:24.058
Very right. (laughs)

08:24.158 --> 08:26.193
Thank you.

08:26.427 --> 08:29.329
Now, the other issues are discussing

08:29.531 --> 08:31.832
<i>the crystal, the silverware,</i>

08:32.033 --> 08:34.033
<i>and the china place settings.</i>

08:41.341 --> 08:42.808
Come in.

08:42.977 --> 08:45.078
Come in. Don't be shy.

08:50.784 --> 08:53.252
- What's your name?
- Um, Tom.

08:53.353 --> 08:56.055
Thomas. Tom.

08:56.189 --> 08:59.558
Well, Tom Thomas Tom,

08:59.660 --> 09:01.494
I'm Susie.

09:01.695 --> 09:03.155
And there's no need to be nervous.

09:03.163 --> 09:05.031
- I won't bite.
- (chuckles)

09:05.198 --> 09:07.233
Oh, thank you. I've just...

09:07.501 --> 09:09.361
I've never been to one
of these before, so...

09:09.669 --> 09:12.771
Oh, well, if I saw a gentleman on
the street as handsome as you are,

09:13.040 --> 09:15.474
I wouldn't believe there
was a fellow more worldly.

09:18.044 --> 09:20.845
I don't know if I would
describe myself as worldly.

09:20.979 --> 09:22.913
I... oh, thank you.

09:23.049 --> 09:26.618
I've... I've never...

09:26.718 --> 09:28.353
well, I've...

09:28.487 --> 09:31.356
I... I've just never.

09:33.259 --> 09:35.260
Well, to tell you the truth,

09:35.428 --> 09:37.895
this is my first time, too.

09:38.030 --> 09:40.431
Really? You've never?

09:42.268 --> 09:45.770
This is my first week here
and you're my first client.

09:46.004 --> 09:48.439
I saw you come in and I asked for you

09:48.774 --> 09:51.976
because I thought maybe you might
be able to help me through this.

09:55.113 --> 09:57.514
Well, I... I could.

09:57.783 --> 10:01.886
(stammering) I do know
a thing or two about...

10:02.020 --> 10:03.654
ahem, about anatomy.

10:03.956 --> 10:08.559
I'm... I'm... I'm very comfortable
with the human body and...

10:10.028 --> 10:12.462
Then tell me,

10:12.598 --> 10:14.431
what's this called?

10:14.600 --> 10:17.634
(chuckles) Your proboscis.

10:20.538 --> 10:22.205
And this?

10:22.306 --> 10:24.808
Your scapula.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.448
And this?

10:31.583 --> 10:33.584
Your umbilicus.

10:34.987 --> 10:36.120
And this?

10:36.220 --> 10:38.054
Your pelvis.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.090
Iliac crest to be exact.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.893
And this?

10:46.263 --> 10:48.898
And this?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.900
That's my...

10:51.002 --> 10:52.401
It certainly is.

10:54.505 --> 10:56.773
I don't think this is your first time.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.908
It is with you.

11:02.446 --> 11:04.380
Oh.

11:12.856 --> 11:14.790
What's that?

11:14.958 --> 11:16.792
- What happened?
- I'm fine.

11:18.195 --> 11:20.663
You're not. What happened?

11:20.864 --> 11:22.265
I'm none of your business, Doctor.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.199
You made that quite clear.

11:24.368 --> 11:26.736
This is medical, not personal.

11:27.037 --> 11:29.572
You'll forgive me if I don't
want you examining me.

11:29.706 --> 11:31.774
Lucy, what happened?

11:33.177 --> 11:34.744
My father beat me.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.312
Why?

11:39.215 --> 11:41.583
Because I confessed my
sins and humiliated him.

11:43.486 --> 11:46.321
Would you care to guess what
those sins might have been?

11:46.389 --> 11:48.690
No.

11:48.991 --> 11:51.259
- The next time I see that son...
- You're too late.

11:52.895 --> 11:54.955
He said he made more than
enough money in New York

11:55.130 --> 11:57.632
and left to go back home this morning.

11:57.733 --> 11:59.668
Well, he's lucky.

12:03.172 --> 12:06.073
I would have hurt him a whole
lot worse than he hurt you.

12:08.977 --> 12:11.078
You think he's the one who hurt me?

12:12.480 --> 12:13.620
Gallinger: <i>Mrs. Gianoulis,</i>

12:13.815 --> 12:15.849
<i>your son needs to have
his tonsils removed.</i>

12:15.983 --> 12:17.718
They're infected.

12:17.985 --> 12:20.854
What about the others?
You take them out, too?

12:21.055 --> 12:24.291
No, just Alexi needs it, not the rest.

12:24.559 --> 12:26.794
But I leave them with Alexi. I go to work.

12:26.994 --> 12:29.296
- No, no.
- (speaking Greek)

12:29.531 --> 12:30.731
- Mrs. Gianoulis...
- (continues in Greek)

12:30.898 --> 12:32.433
Look, look, Mrs. Gianoulis...

12:32.601 --> 12:34.401
look, these are your children.

12:34.669 --> 12:36.536
You had them, they're
your responsibility,

12:36.670 --> 12:37.904
not anyone else's.

12:38.206 --> 12:39.873
You take them with you to
work or take them home,

12:40.108 --> 12:41.674
or whatever, but they can't stay here.

12:41.675 --> 12:44.110
They stay here. They clean, they cook.

12:44.345 --> 12:46.679
- Just take them home.
- I can't pay.

12:59.893 --> 13:02.862
I doubt that Barrow will
want to add this room

13:03.096 --> 13:05.231
to the tours that he's
been giving to donors.

13:09.602 --> 13:11.203
What did Abigail say?

13:11.371 --> 13:13.505
She's considering it.

13:13.807 --> 13:16.641
In the meantime, I'm continuing
with my addiction studies.

13:16.910 --> 13:19.345
- Anything interesting so far?
- Not yet.

13:19.479 --> 13:20.578
As far as I can tell,

13:20.813 --> 13:23.314
addicts have no difference
in their organs

13:23.548 --> 13:26.351
or physical characteristics
to non-addicts.

13:26.652 --> 13:30.688
There's nothing that makes them
more susceptible to addiction

13:30.990 --> 13:36.027
and nothing that can be removed
or treated to cure it.

13:36.162 --> 13:38.396
Given the exterior state

13:38.597 --> 13:40.163
which we found most of these drunks,

13:40.564 --> 13:43.504
you would assume that the interior
would tell some sort of tale as well.

13:43.835 --> 13:48.405
Yeah, but aside from the typical
scarring of the liver, nothing.

13:48.739 --> 13:52.776
Even my examination of Dr.
Mays' corpse was inconclusive.

13:53.111 --> 13:57.047
And that man was most certainly a
drinker if there ever was one.

13:57.282 --> 14:00.849
Well, I can't say that I'm not relieved

14:01.118 --> 14:04.853
that his death occurred on
your watch and not on mine.

14:05.022 --> 14:08.190
Something is making them do it.

14:08.458 --> 14:13.629
And if it's not the body,
it must be the brain.

14:13.763 --> 14:15.764
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

14:17.634 --> 14:21.938
Our fire insurance will cover the
damage to the surgical theater,

14:22.139 --> 14:25.507
and I have started a memorial fund

14:25.642 --> 14:27.876
in Dr. Mays' name.

14:28.044 --> 14:29.945
For the benefit of the widow?

14:30.046 --> 14:33.281
No, the new Knick.

14:33.516 --> 14:35.951
And many of Dr. Mays'
friends at his club

14:36.285 --> 14:40.422
have already donated generously
to the new vented, fireproof

14:40.657 --> 14:43.759
Dr. William H. Mays etherizing rooms

14:44.060 --> 14:47.095
that will now be added to the
plans for the new hospital.

14:48.865 --> 14:51.499
With your permission, of course.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.769
It's a fitting tribute.

14:55.071 --> 14:58.340
I will instruct the architect
to make the necessary changes.

15:01.010 --> 15:05.213
I personally handle the
hiring of every contractor.

15:05.381 --> 15:08.616
With each I make a standard deal.

15:08.851 --> 15:11.752
Give us the best, charge us the most,

15:11.988 --> 15:15.857
and give me a small percentage back.

15:15.992 --> 15:18.226
The more we spend,

15:18.361 --> 15:20.361
the more I get.

15:20.561 --> 15:22.696
And with a building this large,

15:22.931 --> 15:25.866
there's no shortage of craftsmen needed.

15:26.101 --> 15:29.669
An army of plumbers,
electricians, masons.

15:29.871 --> 15:32.939
There are the specialists, too.

15:33.208 --> 15:36.310
Hinge-makers, glass
blowers, wood-carvers.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.816
And I keep the plans
changing as often as I can.

15:43.018 --> 15:45.184
Never an opportunity missed.

15:46.687 --> 15:49.689
Every man has his talents.

15:49.924 --> 15:53.459
Finding gold in the river, that's mine.

15:53.761 --> 15:57.230
And how much gold have you
strained into your pan?

15:57.298 --> 15:59.933
So far?

16:00.100 --> 16:03.102
In the range of $12,000.

16:03.203 --> 16:06.006
(laughs)

16:06.240 --> 16:09.142
That's a sardine in a fisherman's net.

16:09.376 --> 16:11.845
We here at Tammany, we prefer whales.

16:12.212 --> 16:15.814
<i>But it's not a bad thing to hold
on to a sardine now and then.</i>

16:15.916 --> 16:17.917
So, from now on,

16:18.085 --> 16:21.387
15% of your construction costs

16:21.555 --> 16:23.989
before your skim comes to us.

16:24.158 --> 16:25.991
That's a bit high, don't you think?

16:26.126 --> 16:27.793
My contractors will balk.

16:27.928 --> 16:29.429
No, they won't.

16:29.629 --> 16:31.964
Croker: <i>It's the going rate</i>

16:32.299 --> 16:35.768
for keeping things running along
smoothly as they have been.

16:36.003 --> 16:38.438
And we'll show you how to game it right.

16:38.772 --> 16:42.475
You give us our share, we'll
make sure you have no trouble

16:42.676 --> 16:46.345
with the city, politicians, cops,

16:46.646 --> 16:50.782
<i>unions, theft, anything
that might come your way.</i>

16:52.151 --> 16:54.586
Building a hospital's a noble cause

16:54.820 --> 16:57.689
and we here at Tammany want nothing more

16:57.957 --> 17:00.925
than to support you the
best way we know how.

17:02.928 --> 17:05.964
Well, thank you.

17:10.935 --> 17:14.439
The oysterman was picked clean
by the time I got there.

17:14.707 --> 17:17.976
I got some cod we can
fry downstairs instead.

17:19.112 --> 17:20.811
What are you reading?

17:20.880 --> 17:22.714
Nothing.

17:22.982 --> 17:25.450
You're hiding everything
from me these days.

17:25.617 --> 17:27.618
It's just a book, Luce.

17:30.823 --> 17:34.626
"Transactions of the
Association of American Obs..."

17:34.827 --> 17:37.095
"Obstetricians and Gynecologists."

17:38.664 --> 17:41.833
It's about women's bodies.

17:42.067 --> 17:44.568
I've been treating some special patients

17:44.803 --> 17:47.171
on my own since one of the doctors died.

17:47.372 --> 17:49.306
And I want to do right by them, so...

17:50.743 --> 17:52.744
"The covering is quite vascular

17:52.978 --> 17:56.080
and appears like thickened muscul..."

17:56.214 --> 17:58.616
Musculoperitoneal.

17:58.851 --> 18:00.952
It's a membrane that lines the abdomen.

18:01.020 --> 18:02.219
Ew.

18:02.354 --> 18:05.189
It's not that bad.

18:05.524 --> 18:08.759
If you want to be a doctor, I suppose
you have to like these things.

18:08.927 --> 18:11.462
There are no woman doctors.

18:11.663 --> 18:14.265
Then it's about time we had one.

18:14.399 --> 18:15.999
I'm not smart enough.

18:17.902 --> 18:20.604
You're smart enough to treat those
special patients on your own.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.973
You haven't killed any
of them yet, have you?

18:23.041 --> 18:24.775
No.

18:25.009 --> 18:27.778
Then maybe you know more than you think.

18:28.012 --> 18:30.281
- Come on, we're late.
- You're a madman.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.617
It's fun, isn't it?

18:33.952 --> 18:36.492
- Phillip: <i>Onto the 7:00 A.M.
train to New Orleans. - Phillip.</i>

18:38.355 --> 18:41.415
Yes, well, at least she'll make the
barges up by the river by the next day.

18:43.561 --> 18:46.096
Well, it's better that than
they limp east for three days.

18:46.363 --> 18:48.799
Damn it, man, get off that thing.
It's lunchtime.

18:49.067 --> 18:51.007
You'd have one in your
automobile if you could.

18:51.102 --> 18:52.903
Oh, pfft. Give Edison some time.

18:53.071 --> 18:54.938
I'll wager he'll figure it out.

18:55.106 --> 18:57.407
So this is a nice surprise.

18:57.642 --> 18:59.742
We so seldom get to have lunch together.

18:59.943 --> 19:02.812
(laughs) This isn't the surprise.

19:03.046 --> 19:04.880
They are waiting in the other room.

19:08.652 --> 19:10.753
- August: <i>Oh, Henry.</i>
<i>- Henry: Dad.</i>

19:11.088 --> 19:13.590
August: Neely, I was worried
you two weren't gonna make it.

19:13.890 --> 19:16.559
Henry: <i>Traffic. Now, if
there was a subway...</i>

19:16.727 --> 19:18.761
August: Henry, not today.

19:18.996 --> 19:22.631
Today we are celebrating
Algernon and his wife.

19:22.733 --> 19:24.100
(laughs)

19:24.167 --> 19:26.135
His wife?

19:26.269 --> 19:27.803
Henry: Surprise.

19:28.005 --> 19:30.139
Our man went off and got married

19:30.306 --> 19:32.007
and never breathed a word.

19:32.275 --> 19:34.777
Cornelia, may I introduce
Mrs. Opal Edwards?

19:34.978 --> 19:37.012
Opal, this is Cornelia Showalter.

19:37.180 --> 19:40.115
Very pleased to meet you.

19:40.416 --> 19:43.151
Our first trip to Paris was
for the '89 exposition.

19:43.453 --> 19:46.655
(clears throat) When they
opened the Eiffel Tower.

19:46.822 --> 19:48.457
- What did you think?
- Oh!

19:48.691 --> 19:51.293
Cornelia and I nearly
fainted at the sight.

19:51.661 --> 19:54.361
- (laughter) - You saved that until
they lit it up in the evening.

19:54.464 --> 19:56.204
No, it's a marvelous
piece of engineering.

19:56.332 --> 19:57.932
It's a stain on a perfect city.

19:58.134 --> 20:00.369
That's a bit dramatic, isn't it, Opal?

20:00.603 --> 20:02.504
She's a performer.
There's always a flair.

20:02.639 --> 20:04.104
No, it's how I feel.

20:04.373 --> 20:06.707
You had reservations about
it yourself, Algernon.

20:06.941 --> 20:09.543
What the tower shows to me is progress.

20:09.811 --> 20:12.413
I mean, that even the
impossible is possible.

20:12.649 --> 20:15.183
That's a virtue I
instilled in my children.

20:15.318 --> 20:16.585
Algernon as well.

20:16.786 --> 20:18.820
- Opal: <i>Is that so?</i>
<i>- Mm.</i>

20:19.021 --> 20:22.056
Opal, we cannot emphasize enough

20:22.392 --> 20:26.261
how impressed we are with what
Algernon has been able to accomplish.

20:26.628 --> 20:29.363
Edwards: Well, I certainly benefited
from your progressive thinking.

20:29.364 --> 20:31.299
Henry: Well, he means the world to us.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.335
<i>- Doesn't he, Neely?
- He does.</i>

20:34.503 --> 20:36.069
Opal: If that's the case,

20:36.338 --> 20:40.240
then why are his parents
not invited to this lunch?

20:40.375 --> 20:41.575
- Excuse me?
- Opal.

20:41.810 --> 20:43.977
This is a celebration, as you put it.

20:44.213 --> 20:46.073
So why is it that they
can't sit here with us

20:46.381 --> 20:48.749
instead of having to stay beneath the
house waiting for a bell to be rung?

20:48.983 --> 20:50.318
Because that's not how things are done.

20:50.385 --> 20:52.586
(coughs)

20:52.721 --> 20:54.021
Opal: Pardon me, then.

20:55.490 --> 20:57.590
I suppose we have different definitions

20:57.725 --> 20:59.459
of the term progressive.

21:01.696 --> 21:04.364
Are we ready to clear plates
for dessert, Captain, sir?

21:15.175 --> 21:17.109
What were you trying
to prove back there?

21:17.278 --> 21:19.011
Am I not allowed an opinion?

21:19.213 --> 21:21.147
Or is that also too progressive?

21:21.349 --> 21:23.216
You were trying to pick a fight.

21:23.584 --> 21:26.564
They talk as though they are responsible
for your success instead of you.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.587
He simply said that he was proud of me,

21:28.789 --> 21:30.622
not proud of what they did for me.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.458
There is a big difference.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.494
It was unfair.

21:36.864 --> 21:38.797
You're right.

21:39.099 --> 21:42.568
I apologize for being unfair
to those rich white people.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.439
I got enough, I'll buy
myself a decent bottle.

21:48.741 --> 21:52.510
A little short, there's a rotgut
hang, Swedish, by the water.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.413
Sells penny beers and two-cent whiskey.

21:55.714 --> 21:59.017
Thackery: Jeez, what's
two-cent whiskey taste like?

21:59.118 --> 22:01.386
Not like whiskey.

22:01.453 --> 22:03.054
Wendell.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.589
John.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.791
I think I can help you.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.860
I don't go in for no religion shit.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.461
I don't either. I'm a doctor.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.029
Not interested.

22:12.297 --> 22:15.766
You interested in clean
clothes, three meals a day,

22:16.134 --> 22:19.703
and a much more comfortable bed than
the one you're currently sleeping on?

22:19.905 --> 22:21.805
Buy me a bottle, I'll let you know.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.608
<i>(music playing)</i>

22:51.035 --> 22:53.069
(knocks)

22:55.373 --> 22:57.140
Mary.

23:18.996 --> 23:20.997
Evening.

23:21.232 --> 23:23.466
Glad all you fancy ladies could make it.

23:23.834 --> 23:26.635
I'm sure there are lots of people
uptown who think you've gone shopping

23:26.636 --> 23:27.870
or to the hair parlor.

23:28.138 --> 23:29.757
I don't like being called
here by the likes of you.

23:29.758 --> 23:32.175
And I don't give a good goddamn.

23:32.409 --> 23:35.311
We're not out there anymore.
We're in here now.

23:36.546 --> 23:38.214
Now listen.

23:38.482 --> 23:41.784
My Harriet has got a real
God-fearing gavel-banger

23:41.919 --> 23:43.486
putting her on trial

23:43.720 --> 23:45.054
and he ain't giving her a fair shake.

23:45.189 --> 23:47.123
That's not our concern.

23:47.358 --> 23:50.393
I'm making it your fucking concern.

23:50.594 --> 23:55.664
Each and every one of you uptown ladies

23:55.832 --> 23:56.999
came to me for the fix.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.635
And my girl did it for you,

23:59.736 --> 24:01.937
safe and secret.

24:02.071 --> 24:04.807
Secret? Look around.

24:04.941 --> 24:06.542
We all know each other.

24:06.743 --> 24:09.111
I doubt any of you will be tattling

24:09.345 --> 24:11.814
considering your shared circumstance.

24:11.948 --> 24:14.617
But I know one girl

24:14.885 --> 24:17.753
who could slabber on
like the church gossip.

24:18.021 --> 24:20.589
<i>Lawyer puts her up there on the stand,</i>

24:20.724 --> 24:22.391
<i>hand on the Bible,</i>

24:22.592 --> 24:24.527
swearing to God to tell the truth.

24:25.929 --> 24:28.296
A nun like Harriet

24:28.532 --> 24:30.833
is likely to have a bout of conscience,

24:30.967 --> 24:34.269
<i>confess to what she done</i>

24:34.438 --> 24:37.405
<i>and who she done it with.</i>

24:37.540 --> 24:39.741
Naming names.

24:39.909 --> 24:42.309
Spilling the whole thing.

24:42.377 --> 24:44.445
Hmm?

24:44.713 --> 24:47.916
Newspapermen there
writing everything down

24:48.083 --> 24:50.217
for their evening editions.

24:50.486 --> 24:53.521
- (gasps)
- By the next morning, you'll all be famous.

24:53.789 --> 24:57.124
What do you want from us?
We can't stop the trial.

24:57.292 --> 24:59.928
Cleary: But your fellas can.

25:00.162 --> 25:02.897
I doubt you was letting
penniless shine boys

25:03.098 --> 25:05.232
<i>put the bat in the cave,</i>

25:05.501 --> 25:08.436
<i>so I want you to go to
these powerful fellas</i>

25:08.604 --> 25:10.672
who emptied their bags in you

25:10.973 --> 25:14.208
and let them know that they
can either use their money

25:14.343 --> 25:17.010
to get this gone now

25:17.245 --> 25:21.282
or it's you and them on the stand next.

25:23.651 --> 25:25.252
Off with ya!

25:45.873 --> 25:47.740
You think they'll do it?

25:47.941 --> 25:50.143
Your guess is as good as mine.

25:50.311 --> 25:52.011
But as far as I'm concerned,

25:52.179 --> 25:53.913
we're even on favors now.

25:56.550 --> 25:57.717
Thackery: <i>So when they
finish their baths,</i>

25:57.951 --> 26:00.320
put them in a separate area of the ward.

26:00.554 --> 26:04.257
And keep the medicine
cart away from them.

26:04.525 --> 26:07.327
Dr. Thackery, there's an
emergency in exam room four.

26:07.395 --> 26:08.928
Mrs. Alford.

26:15.536 --> 26:16.736
What happened?

26:16.904 --> 26:18.570
She had a seizure in her home.

26:18.839 --> 26:21.073
Chimney sweep saw her
through the window.

26:21.241 --> 26:22.842
I insisted they bring me here.

26:23.010 --> 26:25.011
Thank you, Dr. Grindin.

26:25.145 --> 26:26.979
I'll take over.

26:31.351 --> 26:34.687
I'm so embarrassed.

26:34.855 --> 26:36.889
I was making breakfast.

26:37.223 --> 26:39.959
Next thing I know, I wake up with
cracked eggs all in my hair.

26:43.897 --> 26:46.298
I'm really scared now, John.

26:47.768 --> 26:49.535
I know.

27:16.696 --> 27:20.399
It could be a while before
the malaria takes effect.

27:22.302 --> 27:24.002
Looking forward to it.

27:33.045 --> 27:34.913
<i>(chatter)</i>

27:45.124 --> 27:46.825

27:47.126 --> 27:50.361
<i>who were supposed to show
us how to live our lives,</i>

27:50.596 --> 27:53.731
<i>we are supposed to respect and trust</i>

27:53.832 --> 27:55.599
<i>and honor them.</i>

27:55.800 --> 27:59.103
Well, they've all disappointed me

27:59.303 --> 28:03.440
and betrayed me and thrown me away.

28:06.111 --> 28:07.845
Why do I let them?

28:07.979 --> 28:10.914
Why do we let them?

28:12.416 --> 28:14.852
It doesn't make any sense.

28:16.287 --> 28:18.355
And I'm sick of it.

28:21.259 --> 28:23.560
God tests us all.

28:28.699 --> 28:32.335
All I know is I'm not
getting what I deserve.

28:32.537 --> 28:34.638
What is it you think you deserve?

28:37.007 --> 28:39.075
Something better.

28:39.177 --> 28:40.943
(clicking)

28:43.147 --> 28:47.116
My daughter Ethel attends
the Brearley School.

28:47.285 --> 28:50.186
Her Latin is coming along.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.822
And Leonard attends Trinity.

28:52.956 --> 28:54.257
Quite the sportsman.

28:54.458 --> 28:56.859
<i>And he's named after my father.</i>

28:56.994 --> 28:59.162
The fishmonger.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.766
My father not only sold fish, sir,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.501
he smelled of fish, he talked to fish,

29:05.735 --> 29:08.904
he dreamed of fish, he
was besotted with fish.

29:09.005 --> 29:10.706
<i>(laughs)</i>

29:11.007 --> 29:13.027
<i>He actually believed he
could breathe underwater.</i>

29:13.142 --> 29:14.677
(all laugh)

29:14.844 --> 29:17.513
<i>It's true. It's true.</i>

29:19.181 --> 29:22.249
But I wanted something else.

29:22.418 --> 29:25.286
This, to be quite frank.

29:26.855 --> 29:29.390
And I think we can all agree
it beats the fish business.

29:29.658 --> 29:33.594
We'd like to think so.
Now, who's your sponsor?

29:35.163 --> 29:36.664
It was Dr. Mays,

29:36.932 --> 29:39.734
but I think we're all aware
of the recent tragedy.

29:39.935 --> 29:43.204
A dead man can't sponsor a live one.

29:43.339 --> 29:45.473
It's in the bylaws.

29:51.113 --> 29:53.514
<i>(music playing)</i>

29:53.716 --> 29:55.683
<i>(people laughing, chatting)</i>

29:56.785 --> 29:58.335
It takes a little while to get up here,

29:58.336 --> 30:00.087
but it's worth it.

30:00.355 --> 30:02.223
Do a lot of Negroes live this far uptown?

30:02.290 --> 30:03.657
Starting to,

30:03.859 --> 30:05.792
especially after last year's riot.

30:06.194 --> 30:08.729
Don't need to live cheek by jowl with
people who are trying to kill you.

30:08.930 --> 30:10.697
Maybe you should consider it as well.

30:10.932 --> 30:12.752
There are new buildings
going up everywhere.

30:12.801 --> 30:14.701
There are barely any farms left.

30:15.103 --> 30:18.172
But with the Knick moving uptown, this
might not be a bad location for me.

30:18.373 --> 30:20.107
That's if they take you with them.

30:20.208 --> 30:21.742
They will.

30:22.043 --> 30:24.111
You're so sure of your
patrons, the Robertsons?

30:24.212 --> 30:25.445
I am.

30:25.613 --> 30:28.281
And Thackery knows my worth.

30:28.448 --> 30:30.350
What's this area called?

30:32.052 --> 30:33.286
Harlem.

30:33.453 --> 30:36.055
(man chuckling) Algernon.

30:36.123 --> 30:37.757
Russell.

30:39.093 --> 30:41.294
- Hello there.
- Hi.

30:41.428 --> 30:43.296
Good to see you.

30:43.463 --> 30:45.064
(indistinct chattering)

30:45.166 --> 30:47.367
(music playing)

30:53.306 --> 30:55.540
- (chuckles)
- What?

30:55.675 --> 30:58.310
You have a gray hair.

30:58.477 --> 31:00.812
- Where?
- (chuckles)

31:00.947 --> 31:02.781
It's right there.

31:02.849 --> 31:05.050
(laughs)

31:05.185 --> 31:06.385
<i>I haven't told you,</i>

31:06.585 --> 31:09.854
but I have a terrible disease.

31:09.956 --> 31:11.589
What disease?

31:11.825 --> 31:13.758
- It's called aging.
- <i>(laughs) Oh.</i>

31:14.027 --> 31:17.495
Very slow, but eventually
all my hair will turn gray,

31:17.630 --> 31:19.097
I'll lose all my teeth,

31:19.365 --> 31:21.533
I'll have to walk with a
cane and inevitably die.

31:21.634 --> 31:23.302
There's no cure.

31:23.502 --> 31:24.969
Maybe I shouldn't be near you.

31:25.204 --> 31:27.305
Mm, it's too late.
It's highly contagious.

31:27.505 --> 31:29.740
And, sorry to say, you've caught it.

31:30.042 --> 31:32.810
Even with my eyes, I can see
the first signs right there.

31:33.045 --> 31:36.213
You say one word about
a hair or a wrinkle,

31:36.381 --> 31:37.815
I will break your fingers.

31:38.116 --> 31:39.550
Sorry, my hearing isn't
what it used to be either.

31:39.784 --> 31:41.752
What was that about your wrinkles?

32:02.806 --> 32:05.141
I'm finally being let out of the lab,

32:05.309 --> 32:06.909
if only for one procedure.

32:07.011 --> 32:08.511
Bertie.

32:08.712 --> 32:10.480
To assist Dr. Zinberg in the removal

32:10.714 --> 32:12.882
of a traumatic keloid
of the median nerve.

32:12.984 --> 32:15.651
What's that?

32:15.887 --> 32:18.154
It's extra tissue on a
nerve in a woman's arm

32:18.389 --> 32:20.356
that causes her not to
have any use of it.

32:20.523 --> 32:22.024
So it just hangs there?

32:22.158 --> 32:23.725
- Mm-hmm.
- Ew.

32:24.027 --> 32:26.728
- Clara.
- She probably doesn't have much sensation.

32:27.097 --> 32:30.099
Could you imagine not being able to
feel things with your fingertips?

32:32.869 --> 32:34.903
It's routine work.

32:35.205 --> 32:38.073
Clearly he's not going out
on much of a limb with you.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.910
I think it means Bertie's passed
Dr. Zinberg's initial test.

32:42.112 --> 32:43.979
He knows what he's got in the boy.

32:46.449 --> 32:48.883
I'm not sure it's that
spectacular, Mother.

32:48.951 --> 32:50.584
Agreed.

32:50.886 --> 32:53.488
Bertram's still a long way
from getting the man's trust.

32:55.124 --> 32:57.492
(whispers) He knows you're special.

33:04.266 --> 33:06.000
Are you all right, Mother?

33:06.101 --> 33:07.568
Of course.

33:07.702 --> 33:09.970
Who wants more peas?

33:12.942 --> 33:15.309
Bertie: I'll definitely have some.
Thank you.

33:29.123 --> 33:31.591
Cigars and scotch.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.893
This is a first for us.

33:36.064 --> 33:38.198
I suppose I should have
done this with you sooner.

33:41.902 --> 33:43.870
You're a man now.

33:46.074 --> 33:50.143
And you'll need to be as I have good
reason for having you here for a talk.

33:50.244 --> 33:51.944
You do?

33:57.817 --> 34:00.052
You noticed your mother
struggling at dinner.

34:01.989 --> 34:04.123
Yes, I did.

34:04.424 --> 34:07.593
It's been going on for a
while and it's gotten worse.

34:10.330 --> 34:12.398
Has she seen anyone?

34:12.632 --> 34:14.333
We've been to Presbyterian Hospital,

34:14.501 --> 34:16.534
Women's Hospital, and Roosevelt.

34:16.703 --> 34:19.538
Two experts at Columbia as well.

34:19.606 --> 34:21.272
And?

34:21.440 --> 34:24.009
What's the diagnosis?

34:24.143 --> 34:26.277
An esophageal mass.

34:28.014 --> 34:29.982
When was this taken?

34:30.049 --> 34:32.417
Last week.

34:32.552 --> 34:34.786
It has to be removed.

34:34.853 --> 34:36.054
How?

34:37.956 --> 34:39.992
It's taken over her esophagus.

34:40.326 --> 34:42.761
There's no way to remove it
without tearing out her throat.

34:42.962 --> 34:45.764
Well, it can't stay in there.

34:45.899 --> 34:47.998
There's no procedure.

34:49.467 --> 34:51.400
We've been to all the
best men in the city.

34:51.570 --> 34:53.504
If it comes out, it kills her.

34:53.705 --> 34:56.007
If it stays in, it kills her.

34:59.878 --> 35:01.411
Does she know?

35:03.982 --> 35:06.117
I haven't told her yet.

35:08.219 --> 35:11.355
But your mother was an
exceptional nurse in her day.

35:13.692 --> 35:15.559
She knows something's very wrong.

35:15.726 --> 35:17.628
Zinberg: <i>How old is she?</i>

35:17.695 --> 35:19.729
49.

35:19.830 --> 35:21.565
Terrible.

35:21.666 --> 35:24.000
I am sorry.

35:24.269 --> 35:27.437
My grandmother unfortunately
died of the same

35:27.605 --> 35:29.939
when I was in primary school.

35:30.208 --> 35:32.576
And in all the years and
with all the advances,

35:32.743 --> 35:34.545
we still haven't licked it.

35:36.781 --> 35:38.010
The best we can do for your mother

35:38.014 --> 35:41.317
is make her feel as
comfortable as possible.

35:41.518 --> 35:44.019
Various opiates to ease her pain.

35:45.556 --> 35:46.936
<i>I know a very good private nurse</i>

35:47.091 --> 35:48.957
<i>who could stay with her at your home.</i>

35:49.126 --> 35:51.994
Thank you, that's very kind.

35:53.630 --> 35:55.864
But I'm not prepared to
surrender her just yet.

35:56.133 --> 35:59.402
I came in early this morning
and read what I could find

35:59.603 --> 36:02.471
on procedures that have showed promise.

36:02.606 --> 36:06.675
<i>Promise is not proof.</i>

36:07.042 --> 36:09.644
<i>It's all still more hope than
anything else, I'm afraid.</i>

36:12.415 --> 36:15.450
Well, I would at least
like to look into it further.

36:15.551 --> 36:18.286
<i>Of course.</i>

36:18.621 --> 36:21.323
<i>As long as it doesn't take you
away from your duties here.</i>

36:21.457 --> 36:23.525
<i>She's your mother.</i>

36:25.294 --> 36:28.730
But I caution you, Dr. Chickering.

36:28.931 --> 36:30.898
Don't let that cloud your judgment.

36:47.249 --> 36:51.252
Cornelia, there's something
Phillip wants to tell you.

36:51.319 --> 36:53.754
There is?

36:55.289 --> 36:57.724
I have to do some
travelling for my father.

36:59.193 --> 37:01.228
Well, where are you going?

37:02.797 --> 37:05.732
Allen County, Ohio,
near a place called Lima.

37:05.967 --> 37:07.734
We have an oil refinery and the kerosene

37:07.969 --> 37:09.903
we're producing isn't
selling like it used to.

37:10.171 --> 37:13.439
Edison's killing us
with his electric bonanza.

37:13.675 --> 37:16.209
Nobody's lighting with kerosene anymore.

37:16.510 --> 37:20.579
Yes, we need to find a use for
all that oil or shut it down.

37:20.781 --> 37:23.615
Well, how long will you be gone?

37:23.784 --> 37:27.153
A few weeks. A month, maybe.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.388
Eunice: <i>Well, you can
rest easy, Phillip,</i>

37:29.823 --> 37:33.458
knowing that we'll take delicate care of
your sweet Cornelia while you're away.

37:42.569 --> 37:45.137
<i>(footsteps)</i>

37:49.809 --> 37:51.510
I'll be back shortly.

37:51.711 --> 37:53.745
Just have to run a few errands

37:53.913 --> 37:55.447
and then we'll have lunch.

37:55.548 --> 37:57.081
That's fine.

38:52.070 --> 38:53.703
Come on.

38:57.541 --> 38:59.108
Spare some change, miss?

38:59.309 --> 39:01.777
- I can't.
- We haven't eaten today.

39:01.979 --> 39:04.747
- Just a penny.
- No, leave me alone.

39:06.216 --> 39:07.416
(shrieks)

39:07.550 --> 39:09.651
(shivering)

39:11.655 --> 39:13.555
Temperature is 103.

39:13.791 --> 39:15.925
That's up two degrees
since this morning.

39:15.993 --> 39:17.693
Vomiting?

39:17.828 --> 39:20.195
Four times already.

39:20.329 --> 39:22.063
Headaches are constant.

39:23.632 --> 39:25.767
She's in the throes of it now.

39:27.503 --> 39:31.973
My big concern is the jaundice.

39:32.141 --> 39:33.942
Do you think it's cirrhosis?

39:34.110 --> 39:35.810
That's incredibly rare.

39:35.912 --> 39:37.845
Afraid so.

39:38.147 --> 39:40.581
We thought all we had to
deal with was a hurricane,

39:40.817 --> 39:43.518
but now we've added
a twister in the mix.

39:43.619 --> 39:45.586
Dr. Gallinger.

39:45.822 --> 39:47.755
There's an urgent call
for you downstairs.

39:54.095 --> 39:56.964
I tried to get away, but
then I tripped and I fell.

39:57.265 --> 39:59.567
And they came towards me,
so I started screaming.

39:59.802 --> 40:02.437
- Are you hurt?
- I don't think so.

40:05.607 --> 40:07.207
Where were you?

40:07.343 --> 40:09.677
I had an appointment.

40:09.878 --> 40:11.746
I didn't know she had gone out.

40:11.947 --> 40:13.448
Eleanor: <i>I'm sorry, Everett.</i>

40:13.649 --> 40:16.050
<i>I just wanted some fresh air.</i>

40:16.184 --> 40:18.152
No, it's all right.

40:19.888 --> 40:21.522
What happened to the thieves?

40:21.790 --> 40:25.593
One slipped into a sewage
drain and got away,

40:25.828 --> 40:28.563
but we got the other one right here.

40:28.664 --> 40:30.163
Let me see him.

40:31.632 --> 40:33.299
Name's Paulo.

40:33.468 --> 40:35.669
Dago. Born over there.

40:35.837 --> 40:37.804
Come here a little while back.

40:38.038 --> 40:39.806
We've picked him up a time or two before.

40:39.907 --> 40:42.576
<i>Mostly kid stuff.</i>

40:42.677 --> 40:44.344
Stand up.

40:49.884 --> 40:51.751
Filthy little bastard.

40:56.189 --> 40:58.791
Not so brave, are you now?

41:04.364 --> 41:06.164
Let's go.

41:11.905 --> 41:14.006
- Where's Mr. Whitting?
- He ain't coming.

41:14.207 --> 41:15.627
What do you mean he's not coming?

41:15.742 --> 41:18.143
I had a bit of trouble
with the finances.

41:18.344 --> 41:21.846
I'm sorry, Harry. I'm sorry.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.020
Where's your attorney, Miss Dolan?

41:29.254 --> 41:32.356
He's sick, Your Honor. He's got the flu.

41:34.226 --> 41:37.028
I don't think he'll be
defending me, Your Honor.

41:37.229 --> 41:39.330
And I can't rightly defend myself.

41:39.565 --> 41:42.033
<i>I know you think little of me, but...</i>

41:42.267 --> 41:44.435
If you'll just shut
your trap, Miss Dolan,

41:44.570 --> 41:46.904
I'm dismissing the case.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.372
Dismissing the case?

41:49.741 --> 41:52.721
I've reviewed everything and found
there to be no more reason to proceed.

41:52.877 --> 41:55.646
Lawyer: <i>Your Honor, the
state strenuously objects.</i>

41:55.980 --> 41:59.115
<i>We have evidence, corroborating
witnesses, a good warrant.</i>

41:59.383 --> 42:01.351
Used for the purpose
of entrapping a citizen.

42:01.619 --> 42:04.454
Miss Dolan is to be released
and her record expunged.

42:04.756 --> 42:07.424
I think we deserve more of
an explanation than that.

42:07.492 --> 42:10.060
I don't.

42:10.261 --> 42:12.228
You are free to go, Miss Dolan.

42:13.731 --> 42:15.498
Case dismissed.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.367
(pounds)

42:17.469 --> 42:19.703
(moaning)

42:30.481 --> 42:34.016
Oh, that son-of-a-bitch
spirochete is still wiggling away.

42:35.519 --> 42:37.753
- What's her temperature?
- Holding at 106.

42:37.855 --> 42:39.722
Needs to go higher.

42:39.923 --> 42:41.824
She's cooking to death as it is.

42:42.126 --> 42:44.361
Given her other complications,
we can't wait any longer.

42:44.362 --> 42:46.529
I know, I know. Just let me think.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.797
What is there to think about?

42:49.032 --> 42:51.567
Show her some mercy.
You're frying her brain.

43:00.377 --> 43:02.411
Give her the quinine.

43:05.715 --> 43:07.983
(moans)

43:08.118 --> 43:10.385
Edwards, wait.

43:12.055 --> 43:14.389
- Get the door.
- Jesus Christ.

43:26.368 --> 43:28.436
This will get her fever higher.

43:28.570 --> 43:30.004
What drugs are you taking?

43:30.172 --> 43:31.839
- Nothing.
- Bullshit.

43:32.074 --> 43:33.974
No sane person would
do... this will kill her.

43:34.176 --> 43:36.010
What's the alternative, huh?

43:36.178 --> 43:38.712
More seizures. More spasms.

43:39.014 --> 43:41.882
Headaches that feel like
knives twisting in her skull.

43:42.017 --> 43:43.317
<i>(strikes match)</i>

43:43.685 --> 43:45.945
I know about living on the
edge between life and death.

43:46.088 --> 43:49.089
It's a matter of will and
she has plenty of it.

43:49.323 --> 43:51.258
I won't stand here and watch her die.

43:51.426 --> 43:53.226
We swore to first do no harm

43:53.494 --> 43:55.695
and we violated that the
moment we began this.

43:55.763 --> 43:57.164
It's over.

43:57.265 --> 43:58.698
Not until I say.

44:05.940 --> 44:08.141
(labored breathing)

44:32.466 --> 44:34.500
Quinine now.

45:17.909 --> 45:19.577
So this is your famous truck.

45:19.745 --> 45:21.812
This is her. Hop on in.

45:22.014 --> 45:23.414
We'll go for a proper celebration.

45:23.415 --> 45:24.849
No more cornmeal mush.

45:25.083 --> 45:26.817
What you need is a nice big T-bone

45:27.085 --> 45:29.454
with some suds to wash
it down. I'm buying.

45:29.622 --> 45:30.855
You don't have to do that.

45:30.956 --> 45:33.491
Ah, I want to.

45:33.692 --> 45:35.926
What's better than being free, huh?

45:43.168 --> 45:45.870
And after that, we'll go

45:46.138 --> 45:48.572
for a nice warm piece
of pie on the way home.

45:50.175 --> 45:52.109
- Home?
- Yeah.

45:52.277 --> 45:53.677
You're staying with me.

45:53.845 --> 45:55.112
I got my place all fixed up.

45:55.346 --> 45:57.007
Put an extra bed in the parlor for you.

45:57.015 --> 45:59.415
Had a lady down the hall make
a curtain to go around it.

45:59.684 --> 46:02.118
You want me to live with you?
You're joking.

46:02.219 --> 46:03.686
No jokes, Harry.

46:03.954 --> 46:06.656
You need a place to
live and I'm offering.

46:06.991 --> 46:09.759
Besides, I owe you for keeping
me out of it with the cops.

46:09.994 --> 46:11.861
I need a place, but not with a man.

46:12.063 --> 46:13.563
Aw, come on, it's on the up and up.

46:13.831 --> 46:16.732
Besides, the church ain't
watching you no more.

46:17.068 --> 46:20.335
They may not be, but I won't bring
any more shame to my faith.

46:20.570 --> 46:22.350
And I won't be sharing
any home with a man.

46:22.538 --> 46:24.038
It's not a fucking lovebird's nest.

46:24.074 --> 46:26.041
We'd be roommates is all,
sleeping in different rooms.

46:26.176 --> 46:27.509
It doesn't matter.

46:27.711 --> 46:29.077
Well, where will you go, then?

46:29.245 --> 46:30.846
There's a home for fallen women

46:31.147 --> 46:34.283
run by the Little Sisters
of Mercy on Bank Street.

46:34.517 --> 46:37.018
Could still go for that slice of pie.

46:37.086 --> 46:38.652
All right.

46:38.987 --> 46:42.290
I'll get the apple, you get
the peach and we'll share.

46:42.524 --> 46:44.491
- Harriet: Deal.
- (Cleary laughs)

46:49.164 --> 46:52.666
(ticking)

46:54.336 --> 46:56.670
Well, it's getting late.

46:56.839 --> 46:58.605
I'm going to go to bed.

46:58.741 --> 47:00.107
Are you staying up?

47:00.342 --> 47:02.509
Cornelia: For a bit. Good night.

47:02.611 --> 47:04.110
Good night, dear.

48:03.303 --> 48:06.237
You get one meal a day.

48:06.439 --> 48:08.407
You'll have a week to find a job

48:08.608 --> 48:11.476
and start paying towards your keep.

48:11.644 --> 48:13.177
You'll also be responsible

48:13.446 --> 48:16.515
for 20 hours of work
around here every week.

48:16.749 --> 48:18.983
I'm a decent cook and I was a nurse.

48:19.118 --> 48:21.686
You're on toilets.

48:21.854 --> 48:23.522
We didn't want you here.

48:23.656 --> 48:25.123
I'm getting that.

48:25.458 --> 48:27.759
It's only by the grace of our
charitable Christian hearts

48:27.760 --> 48:29.260
that you were allowed to come here.

48:29.428 --> 48:31.996
- And I'm grateful.
- I don't care what you are.

48:32.131 --> 48:33.932
Here's your bed.

48:34.133 --> 48:36.867
It'll have to do you for now.

48:40.172 --> 48:41.772
Are there any sheets and pillows?

48:41.974 --> 48:45.310
Dreadful. What kind were they?

48:45.377 --> 48:47.211
Italian.

48:47.379 --> 48:49.480
Dark-haired, dark-skinned?

48:49.614 --> 48:52.250
Yes. And small.

48:52.384 --> 48:54.718
Southern most likely, then.

48:55.054 --> 48:58.823
An entirely different breed than
what comes out of Florence or Milan.

49:00.792 --> 49:03.928
Criminals, all of them.

49:04.062 --> 49:06.396
<i>They see vulnerability</i>

49:06.631 --> 49:08.666
in someone good and decent like Eleanor

49:08.867 --> 49:11.368
and they can't help themselves.

49:11.536 --> 49:14.171
Why aren't people outraged?

49:14.339 --> 49:17.007
Eugenics is a new science.

49:17.208 --> 49:19.509
It's up to us to sound the alarm

49:19.643 --> 49:21.177
and spread the word.

49:21.512 --> 49:25.915
However, it is not enough to get
the people to see the problem.

49:26.250 --> 49:29.652
It's getting them to have the
will to do something about it.

49:30.020 --> 49:33.000
Closing the ports to all immigrants
would be an excellent place to start.

49:33.190 --> 49:36.993
It would be, but that
requires political power

49:37.160 --> 49:39.095
and the courage to act

49:39.363 --> 49:42.999
and not be taken in by the
pitying handwringers.

49:43.233 --> 49:47.637
We know we need a more
permanent approach,

49:47.872 --> 49:51.540
a medical solution to stop the growth

49:51.775 --> 49:53.809
of what has already
passed through our doors.

49:54.010 --> 49:57.746
How? They breed like animals.

49:58.014 --> 50:00.716
And how do you stop an
animal from breeding?

50:03.119 --> 50:05.153
You neuter it.

50:08.124 --> 50:10.325
Sterilization.

50:10.427 --> 50:13.395
On a mass scale.

50:42.424 --> 50:43.958
Excuse me.

50:44.225 --> 50:46.561
I was told that the Speight
family lived here.

50:46.728 --> 50:48.462
Inspector Jacob Speight.

50:48.597 --> 50:50.397
Oh? He's dead.

50:50.566 --> 50:52.600
I know, but the family?

50:52.835 --> 50:54.769
Up and left all of a sudden right after.

50:54.970 --> 50:56.871
Maybe off to her family somewhere.

50:57.138 --> 51:00.707
They got out so fast, I
didn't have time to ask.

51:00.808 --> 51:02.442
Thank you.

52:35.368 --> 52:37.869
<i>(metal clinking)</i>

52:41.874 --> 52:44.809
<i>(metal clinking)</i>

53:01.693 --> 53:03.627
Abby: <i>John?</i>

53:06.131 --> 53:07.665
