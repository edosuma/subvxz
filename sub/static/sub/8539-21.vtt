OH, YEAH.FLU.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.667
I'M NOT REALLY
SUPPOSED TO DO THIS,

11:51.754 --> 11:55.366
BUT IF YOU WANT, I CAN WRITE
A PRESCRIPTION FOR AN ANTIVIRAL.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.107
UH, SURE.

11:57.194 --> 11:59.196
[clicks pen]

11:59.283 --> 12:00.894
[scribbles]

12:00.981 --> 12:03.113
HAVE THIS FILLED AND...

12:03.200 --> 12:06.290
YOU WILL FEEL BETTER
IN NO TIME.[tears paper]

12:06.377 --> 12:08.945
UH, SURE. THANKS.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.947
[sniffles] THANK YOU.

12:14.342 --> 12:17.301
ANY WORD FROM
GULBRAND'S PARTNER?NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF MOTIVE,

12:17.388 --> 12:19.869
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE
AN ALIBI FOR THE NIGHT.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.523
[Van Pelt] GULBRAND'S
BROTHER, CHECKED OUT.

12:21.610 --> 12:24.091
A GRETCHEN MOORE SAYS HE WAS
WITH HER THAT NIGHT.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.570
ROOMMATE BACKS UP THE STORY.

12:25.657 --> 12:28.486
[coughs]ARE YOU STILL SICK?

12:28.573 --> 12:29.574
[moans]

12:29.661 --> 12:31.272
MAN, GO SEE A DOCTOR.

12:31.359 --> 12:34.188
I DID. THE DEAD GUY'S GIRLFRIEND
WROTE ME A PRESCRIPTION.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.800
SO GO FILL IT.NAH. BY THE TIME I TAKE IT,
I'LL BE BETTER.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.323
WHAT'D SHE GIVE YOU ANYWAY?

12:39.410 --> 12:41.630
UGH. [coughs]

12:46.374 --> 12:48.637
"OSELTAMIVIR PHOSPHATE."

12:50.595 --> 12:51.901
MAY I SEE THAT?

12:56.601 --> 12:58.865
THANK YOU.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.605
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
STRIKE YOU AS ODD?

13:04.174 --> 13:05.959
WHAT'S ODD ABOUT IT?
"OSELTAMIVIR PHOSPHATE."

13:06.046 --> 13:08.526
EXACTLY. YOU CAN READ IT.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

13:08.613 --> 13:10.833
YOU SAW A DOCTOR'S HANDWRITING
THAT YOU COULD READ?

13:10.920 --> 13:13.618
SO SHE'S PRECISE.
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING?

13:13.705 --> 13:15.577
YES, AND THE POSSIBILITY

13:15.664 --> 13:18.710
THAT DR. BROOKE HARPER
IS NOT A DOCTOR.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.582
BECAUSE SHE HAS
PENMANSHIP SKILLS?

13:20.669 --> 13:23.411
AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THAT COLD, CREEPY, DOCTOR-Y VIBE

13:23.498 --> 13:26.544
THEY ALL HAVE.BE FAIR. NOT ALL DOCTORS
ARE COLD AND CREEPY.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.373
FIRST DAY OF MEDICAL SCHOOL,
THEY GET A STACK OF BOOKS

13:29.460 --> 13:32.246
AND A DEAD HUMAN BEING--THAT,
I'M AFRAID, WILL CHANGE YOU,

13:32.333 --> 13:35.292
BROOKE HARPER
WAS WARM AND EMOTIONAL.

13:35.379 --> 13:38.513
YOU LIKE HER,
SO SHE CAN'T BE A DOCTOR.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.775
PRETTY MUCH.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.646
THE A.M.A. AND BOSTON GENERAL

13:41.733 --> 13:44.214
BOTH HAVE RECORDS
OF A DOCTOR NAMED BROOKE HARPER.

13:44.301 --> 13:45.563
SEE?

13:45.650 --> 13:48.828
BUT IT SAYS HERE
THAT SHE'S 64 YEARS OLD.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.569
WOW.
SHE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.963
IS THERE A WORD
FOR UNCANNY AND IRRITATING?

14:00.448 --> 14:04.495
JEFF, I'M GONNA BE
LEAVING THE CLINIC SHORTLY,

14:04.582 --> 14:06.758
SO THIS IS GONNA BE
OUR LAST SESSION TOGETHER.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.718
OH. OH, NO, NO, NO.

14:09.805 --> 14:12.503
I-I-I NEED YOU, DR. HARPER.
HOW WILL I MANAGE WITHOUT YOU?

14:12.590 --> 14:14.854
I'M SORRY, JEFF. I HAVE
ENJOYED OUR SESSIONS TOGETHER,

14:14.941 --> 14:16.899
BUT I'M SURE THE CLINIC
WILL PROVIDE YOU

14:16.986 --> 14:18.814
WITH THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE.OH, BUT--

14:18.901 --> 14:21.164
SHOULD YOU EVER NEED

14:21.251 --> 14:23.906
TO SPEAK WITH
ME PERSONALLY...

14:23.993 --> 14:25.560
HERE'S MY PRIVATE NUMBER.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.303
I'M VERY SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
DR. HARPER,

14:29.390 --> 14:32.349
BUT THE CBI ARE HERE,
THEY NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.656
TELL THEM I'LL BE WITH
THEM IN TEN MINUTES.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.963
THEY SAID THEY NEED
TO SPEAK WITH YOU NOW,

14:37.050 --> 14:39.835
THIS MOMENT,
AND THEY ARE MOST INSISTENT.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.055
TELL THEM I'LL BE RIGHT OUT,
MAGGIE. THANK YOU.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.363
I MEAN, I JUST...
[sighs]

14:46.450 --> 14:50.324
I FEEL LIKE I'M ON THE VERGE
OF A REAL BREAKTHROUGH. I...

14:50.411 --> 14:52.674
I'M STARTING TO OPEN
MYSELF UP AGAIN TO PEOPLE

14:52.761 --> 14:54.415
IN A REAL WAY.

14:54.502 --> 14:55.938
MY INNER CHILD IS
FINALLY EMERGING.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.071
D--

14:58.158 --> 14:59.724
DR. HARPER?

14:59.811 --> 15:01.509
DR. HARPER?

15:01.596 --> 15:02.553
HEY..

15:06.079 --> 15:07.036
[sighs]

15:07.123 --> 15:08.820
[tires peal]

15:08.908 --> 15:10.083
DAMN.LET'S GO.

15:12.607 --> 15:13.608
UM...

15:20.745 --> 15:22.791
ALL I WAS ABLE TO FIND AT
DR. BROOKE HARPER'S APARTMENT.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.402
BANK ACCOUNT EMPTIED,
CREDIT CARDS MAXED OUT.

15:25.489 --> 15:28.666
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN PACKED
AND READY TO LEAVE DAYS AGO.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.451
HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
AND MEDICAL LICENSE

15:30.538 --> 15:33.671
ARE FAKES, TOO. WE HAVE
NO IDEA WHO THIS WOMAN IS.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.673
WELL, WE KNOW THAT SHE'S SMART.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.024
SHE POSED AS A DOCTOR
FOR SEVEN MONTHS,

15:38.111 --> 15:39.808
MANAGED TO ELUDE
YOU AND RIGSBY.

15:39.895 --> 15:43.812
NO, SHE HAD A HEAD START.
SHE DIDN'T ELUDE US.

15:43.899 --> 15:44.987
ALRIGHT, SHE ELUDED US.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.250
WELL, SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL
CONWOMAN.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.949
I MEAN, SHE PROBABLY
SPECIALIZES IN THE SEDUCTION

15:50.036 --> 15:52.560
OF RICH AND SUCCESSFUL,
SOCIALLY AWKWARD MEN.

15:52.647 --> 15:56.085
YOU THINK
SHE'S DONE THIS BEFORE?OH, YES, MANY TIMES.

15:56.172 --> 15:59.741
WHY KILL JIM GULBRAND?MAYBE HE FOUND OUT
THE TRUTH ABOUT HER.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.699
THEN WHY NOT JUST VANISH?GOOD MORNING.

16:01.786 --> 16:04.398
MORNING.I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
GULBRAND'S FINANCIAL RECORDS

16:04.485 --> 16:06.052
AND FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING.

16:06.139 --> 16:09.969
LAST YEAR, GULBRAND MADE
A SERIES OF CASH WITHDRAWALS

16:10.056 --> 16:11.927
FROM VARIOUS ACCOUNTS,
TOTALING $10 MILLION.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.929
WHAT'D HE SPEND THE MONEY ON?

16:14.016 --> 16:15.887
THAT'S JUST IT.
HE DIDN'T DEPOSIT IT,

16:15.975 --> 16:18.064
AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
HE SPENT IT.

16:18.151 --> 16:21.676
SO EITHER HE PAID SOMEBODY OFF
OR HE HID THE MONEY--

16:21.763 --> 16:25.027
A CASH NEST EGG--EITHER
FROM HIS EX-WIFE OR THE S.E.C.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.855
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT BROOKE HARPER WAS AFTER.

16:26.942 --> 16:29.379
IF ONLY WE KNEW WHO
OR WHERE SHE WAS.

16:29.466 --> 16:32.469
WE KNOW THAT SHE'S COOL,
SHE'S FEARLESS,

16:32.556 --> 16:33.818
SHE'S SYSTEMATIC.

16:33.905 --> 16:36.343
SHE WENT BACK TO
THE CLINIC FOR AN EXTRA DAY

16:36.430 --> 16:38.127
TO TRY AND HOOK
ANOTHER SUCKER.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.302
SHE'S A PLANNER.

16:41.565 --> 16:44.264
COULD WE GET A COPY OF
HER LAST CREDIT CARD STATEMENT?

16:44.351 --> 16:46.440
I CAN GET IT.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.922
AND THEY HAD THE NERVE
TO SEND ME A GOLD MERCEDES

16:51.010 --> 16:55.753
INSTEAD OF A BLACK ONE,
AND SO I SENT IT BACK.KATHRYN GULBRAND?

16:55.840 --> 16:58.756
KATHRYN STUBBS-GULBRAND,
AND YOU'RE INTERRUPTING.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.585
MA'AM, WE HAVE A FEW
QUESTIONS REGARDING
YOUR EX-HUSBAND'S DEATH.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.848
REALLY? YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME NOW?

17:03.935 --> 17:07.417
OR WE CAN TALK TO YOU
AT THE STATION, IF YOU PREFER.FINE.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.115
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, LADIES.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.034
MM. [sniffles]

17:16.687 --> 17:18.994
HOW LONG HAD YOU
AND JIM GULBRAND BEEN DIVORCED?

17:19.081 --> 17:22.650
14 MONTHS--
THAT'S WHEN I MOVED OUT.

17:22.737 --> 17:25.218
THE DIVORCE WAS FINAL
A YEAR AGO.WERE YOU ANGRY?

17:25.305 --> 17:28.656
OF COURSE I WAS ANGRY. THAT'S
USUALLY WHY PEOPLE GET DIVORCED.

17:28.743 --> 17:31.789
COURT DOCUMENTS INDICATE
THAT YOU SUED YOUR EX-HUSBAND
ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.443
YOU BET YOUR ASS I DID.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.228
JIM CLAIMED THE MONEY
THAT HE HAD

17:35.315 --> 17:37.230
IN GAIA MATRIX STOCK
WASN'T ACTUALLY HIS,

17:37.317 --> 17:40.407
BUT PART OF
THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL.
I DISAGREED, AND I WON.

17:40.494 --> 17:43.801
I GOT EVERYTHING
I WANTED AND MORE.[coughs]

17:43.888 --> 17:46.152
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT YOUR EX-HUSBAND

17:46.239 --> 17:48.676
MAY HAVE HIDDEN MONEY FROM YOU
DURING THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.852
WHAT?

17:50.939 --> 17:53.507
HE MADE $10 MILLION
IN CASH WITHDRAWALS LAST YEAR.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.204
YOU WEREN'T AWARE OF THAT?

17:55.291 --> 17:57.380
THAT SON OF A BITCH.
I KNEW IT.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.382
I KNEW HE WAS HOLDING OUT.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.168
THAT WASN'T A DAMN
GYM LOCKER KEY, WAS IT?WHAT KEY?

18:02.255 --> 18:04.692
LAST YEAR HE STARTED WEARING
THIS KEY AROUND HIS NECK.

18:04.779 --> 18:08.130
I ASKED HIM, HE SAID THAT
IT WAS HIS GYM LOCKER KEY.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.566
BUT I KNEW IT WASN'T.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.178
I KNEW IT.[under breath] HOW PERCEPTIVE.

18:12.265 --> 18:15.485
WHAT WAS THAT?OH, NOTHING, MA'AM.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.139
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE MONEY?

18:17.226 --> 18:20.708
IF I DID, IT WOULD
BE MINE RIGHT NOW.

18:20.795 --> 18:23.493
WHERE IS IT?WE DON'T KNOW.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.147
WELL, HALF THAT
MONEY'S LEGALLY MINE.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.932
I DON'T WANT JIM'S LOSER
BROTHER GETTING HIS HANDS ON IT.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.978
YOUR PROBATE JUDGE
WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.415
LAST FRIDAY, THE, UH, NIGHT
OF YOUR EX-HUSBAND'S MURDER,

18:32.502 --> 18:35.244
WHERE WERE YOU
FROM 7:00 THROUGH 10:00 P.M.?

18:35.331 --> 18:37.638
I WAS AT A WINE TASTING
IN NAPA.

18:37.725 --> 18:41.207
COULD YOU CONFIRM THAT FOR US?CAN YOU PEOPLE CHARGE ME
WITH ANY CRIME?

18:41.294 --> 18:44.732
UH, NO, BUT--UH, NO, YOU CAN'T.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.212
MAYBE THEN I'LL TELL YOU

18:46.299 --> 18:47.778
THE DETAILS OF
MY PERSONAL LIFE.

18:47.865 --> 18:50.303
UNTIL THEN,
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

18:50.390 --> 18:51.304
[sniffles]

18:53.741 --> 18:57.179
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH OUR LIAISON AT THE S.E.C.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.615
TURNS OUT JIM GULBRAND

18:58.702 --> 19:01.923
WAS COOPERATING
WITH THEIR INVESTIGATION.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.490
RICK BREGMAN NEVER
MENTIONED IT.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.667
MAKE SURE YOU MENTION IT
TO HIM. WHAT'S THIS?

19:06.754 --> 19:09.626
BROOKE HARPER ONLY USED
A CREDIT CARD TWICE

19:09.713 --> 19:11.498
IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

19:11.585 --> 19:14.805
THIS IS WHAT SHE BOUGHT IN ONE
DAY OF SHOPPING NINE DAYS AGO,

19:14.892 --> 19:17.634
AND THIS IS WHAT
SHE BOUGHT YESTERDAY.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.376
NOW WHAT DO THESE
THINGS TELL US?

19:20.463 --> 19:22.030
THAT'S A WIG, BY THE WAY.

19:22.117 --> 19:25.338
WHAT'S THAT ON THE, UH,
BOTTOM RIGHT?BANDAGE.

19:25.425 --> 19:29.472
IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE A BANDAGE.IT'S A BANDAGE.

19:29.559 --> 19:32.780
WHAT DO THESE THINGS TELL YOU?SHE WANTED
TO POSE AS A MAN?

19:32.867 --> 19:35.783
RIGHT.BUT WHY?
AND WHAT'S THAT OTHER STUFF?

19:35.870 --> 19:37.306
WELL,
THAT'S--THAT'S THE PUZZLE.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.222
IS THAT KATHRYN STUBBS?

19:40.309 --> 19:43.443
SHE'S...
SHE'S AN UNHAPPY PERSON.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.359
WHERE'S RIGSBY?HE WENT TO GET HIS
PRESCRIPTION FILLED.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.752
I THINK THAT KATHRYN WOMAN
ACTUALLY MADE HIM WORSE.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.363
SHE'S HIDING SOMETHING, TOO.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.974
SHE WOULDN'T SAY WHO
SHE WAS WITH THAT NIGHT.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.716
KEEP AN EYE ON HER.INTERESTING.

19:55.803 --> 19:59.023
SHE DID TELL US THAT GULBRAND
WORE A KEY AROUND HIS NECK,

19:59.110 --> 20:01.330
THAT HE SAID
IT WAS FOR HIS GYM LOCKER.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.159
ONLY THERE WASN'T A KEY
FOUND ON THE BODY, RIGHT?NO.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.814
AHA! SHE TOOK HIS KEY.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.816
THAT'S WHY SHE
DRESSED AS A MAN,

20:08.903 --> 20:10.861
SO THAT SHE COULD GET
INTO HIS LOCKER

20:10.948 --> 20:12.907
IN THE MEN'S CHANGING ROOM
OF THE GYM.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.430
BUT IF SHE FOUND
JIM'S MILLIONS,

20:14.517 --> 20:15.779
THEN SHE WOULD'VE
SIMPLY VANISHED.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.259
WHY STICK AROUND?

20:17.346 --> 20:19.305
BECAUSE THE MONEY
WASN'T IN THE LOCKER.

20:19.392 --> 20:23.222
EXACTLY. SHE'S NOW TRYING
TO GET INSIDE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.356
[car engine idling]

20:39.977 --> 20:42.415
[Jane] THANK YOU.[woman] GOOD AFTERNOON.
MAY I HELP YOU?

20:42.502 --> 20:44.460
YEAH. I'M JIM GULBRAND.
I'M A MEMBER HERE.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.245
UH, SIR?

20:46.332 --> 20:50.510
I-I KNOW MR. GULBRAND WELL,
AND YOU ARE NOT HE.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.076
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:52.163 --> 20:54.601
I'M JUST CONFIRMING THAT
JIM'S A MEMBER HERE.

20:54.688 --> 20:57.778
WHY NOT JUST ASK?GO AHEAD. ASK HIM.

20:57.865 --> 21:01.564
IS JIM GULBRAND A MEMBER HERE?I'M SORRY, SIR. WE DON'T
DIVULGE MEMBERSHIP DETAILS.

21:01.651 --> 21:04.741
SEE?THIS IS A MURDER INVESTIGATION.
MR. GULBRAND IS DEAD.

21:04.828 --> 21:07.788
WELL, I'M VERY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.WELL, THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

21:07.875 --> 21:12.009
OH, SIR. SIR, THIS--
THIS IS A PRIVATE CLUB.

21:12.096 --> 21:14.316
WHAT I'M LEARNING--
WHICH IS GOOD FOR OUR THEORY--

21:14.403 --> 21:16.840
IS ONE CAN'T JUST WANDER
IN HERE AND HANG OUT.

21:16.927 --> 21:19.669
ONE NEEDS A PLAN.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.977
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND.THAT'S NOT OUR POLICY, SIR.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.153
IF WE HAVE TO OBTAIN
WITH A WARRANT,

21:25.240 --> 21:28.199
WE'LL TAKE EVERY COMPUTER
AND EVERY PIECE OF PAPER
IN THIS BUILDING,

21:28.287 --> 21:31.464
THEN WE'RE GONNA SIT-DOWN
AND CHAT WITH EACH ONE
OF YOUR MEMBERS.

21:31.551 --> 21:32.769
WELCOME TO THE BACKGAMMON CLUB.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.162
THANK YOU.THANK YOU.

21:36.425 --> 21:37.818
[indistinct conversations]

21:45.042 --> 21:47.610
I DON'T GET IT.
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

21:47.697 --> 21:51.527
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SHE LIKES THE WATER.

21:51.614 --> 21:53.007
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

21:53.094 --> 21:54.748
[mouth full] YEAH, MUCH.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.924
IT'S WEIRD.
I KNOW BROOKE HARPER'S

21:57.011 --> 22:00.710
NOT A REAL DOCTOR, BUT WHATEVER
SHE GAVE ME REALLY WORKED.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.973
GOOD. I WAS GETTING
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.672
YEAH.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.108
HERE.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.153
OH. THANKS.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.162
GRACE?

22:19.990 --> 22:22.166
I'VE BEEN THINKING
THAT MAYBE--HERE WE GO.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.307
RICK BREGMAN.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.531
HMM.

22:38.618 --> 22:40.010
THE BEST FRIEND
AND BUSINESS PARTNER.

22:42.273 --> 22:44.885
AND LOVER OF THE EX-WIFE.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.756
HMM. APPARENTLY.

22:46.843 --> 22:48.062
MM.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.502
[dice roll][Jane] DOUBLE?

22:53.589 --> 22:55.939
NO. YOU WIN.[chuckles]

22:56.026 --> 22:59.595
OUTRAGEOUS LUCK YOU HAVE, NO?
YOU ARE A MONSTER.

22:59.682 --> 23:00.683
WHAT IS IT NOW?

23:00.770 --> 23:03.294
WHAT IS IT?$20,000.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.123
$20,000.I MUST HAVE MY REVENGE.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.603
WELL, IF YOU INSIST.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.605
JANE.WHAT?

23:09.692 --> 23:11.868
SHOULD I SPELL IT OUT?WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN.

23:11.955 --> 23:14.436
ABSOLUTELY.THE FIRST PRINCE
I'VE EVER MET.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.569
HOW SWEET.THANK YOU.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.705
[rolls dice]THERE SHE BLOWS.

23:25.795 --> 23:30.452
UH, PRINCE, UH, CAN I BE EXCUSED
FROM THIS GAME?

23:30.539 --> 23:32.062
MY DATE JUST ARRIVED.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.499
OF COURSE.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.675
MAYBE THAT'S LUCKY
FOR ME, EH?

23:35.762 --> 23:37.590
PROBABLY.[chuckles]

23:37.677 --> 23:40.419
$20,000?MM-HMM.

23:40.506 --> 23:41.855
ENJOY.

23:44.945 --> 23:47.121
HEY, LISTEN. JUST, UH,
JUST FORGET ABOUT THAT, OKAY?

23:47.208 --> 23:49.689
CERTAINLY NOT.
YOU WON FAIR AND SQUARE.

23:49.776 --> 23:52.953
WELL, ACTUALLY, I CHEATED.
UH, I CONTROLLED THE DICE.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.345
[rolls dice]

23:54.433 --> 23:56.435
IT'S IN THE WRIST,
JUST IN THE WRIST.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.001
[rolls dice]

23:58.088 --> 23:59.612
PLEASE DON'T BE OFFENDED.

23:59.699 --> 24:01.918
I'D TAKE THE MONEY
FOR A WORTHY CAUSE,

24:02.005 --> 24:05.226
BUT MY FRIEND HERE IS A MORALIST
OF CHILDISH SIMPLICITY.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.357
NICE TO MEET YOU.

24:21.721 --> 24:24.593
[Jane] HELLO, GORGEOUS.BEAT IT, CREEP.

24:24.680 --> 24:28.554
I'D CALL YOU BY YOUR REAL NAME,
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.469
OH.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.514
HELLO, MR. JANE.HI.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.298
I'M IMPRESSED.
WELL DONE.

24:34.385 --> 24:37.476
OH, FOR FINDING YOU?
IT WASN'T THAT DIFFICULT.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.695
WOULD YOU HAVE A CIGAR?

24:39.782 --> 24:41.392
AH, THANK YOU, NO.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.656
I HEAR THEY'RE NOT SO GOOD
FOR YOUR HEALTH.

24:43.743 --> 24:45.309
WELL, WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER?

24:45.396 --> 24:48.661
IT'D BE HORRIBLE, WOULDN'T IT?
IMMORTALITY?

24:48.748 --> 24:51.533
IMAGINE THE BOREDOM.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.318
MY FRIEND CHO HERE WILL NOW
TAKE YOU BY THE WRISTS

24:54.405 --> 24:57.583
SO AS NOT TO LET YOU
ESCAPE US AGAIN.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.846
HI.MM. WARM HANDS.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.631
AH, I BET YOU SAY THAT
TO ALL YOUR ARRESTING OFFICERS.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.649
WHO ARE YOU, BROOKE?HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

25:20.736 --> 25:23.609
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.
I'LL TELL YOU HOW WE FOUND YOU

25:23.696 --> 25:25.436
IF YOU TELL US WHO YOU ARE.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.788
OKAY. [British accent]
MY NAME IS ANGELA DALIBAR,

25:28.875 --> 25:32.879
AND I'M FROM BIRMINGHAM,
ENGLAND, BY WAY OF HONG KONG.
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

25:32.966 --> 25:36.143
I PLANTED A G.P.S. TRACKING
DEVICE ON YOU.

25:36.230 --> 25:40.147
OUTSTANDING TECHNOLOGY.
NO BIGGER THAN A STICK OF GUM.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.366
CAN YOU TELL US MORE
ABOUT YOURSELF, ANGELA?

25:42.453 --> 25:46.240
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
A PROFESSIONAL CONWOMAN?ALL MY LIFE, I SUPPOSE.

25:46.327 --> 25:49.330
[normal voice] AND I CONFESS,
MY NAME'S NOT REALLY ANGELA.

25:49.417 --> 25:52.376
AND I DIDN'T PLANT
A G.P.S. TRACKING DEVICE ON YOU.

25:53.421 --> 25:54.683
HOW THEN?

25:54.770 --> 25:56.511
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
AS ENIGMATIC AND ELUSIVE

25:56.598 --> 25:59.558
AS YOU THINK YOU ARE.I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE
OF THAT.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.299
NO?

26:02.386 --> 26:05.128
YOU MANIPULATE PEOPLE BECAUSE
YOU TAKE PLEASURE IN IT.

26:05.215 --> 26:08.001
YOU ENJOY BEING
THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE ROOM.

26:08.088 --> 26:10.612
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN MONEY,
OF COURSE,

26:10.699 --> 26:13.659
BUT ONLY SO FAR AS IT ALLOWS YOU
TO CONTINUE CONNING PEOPLE.

26:13.746 --> 26:16.052
YOU ALLOW YOURSELF
ONE INDULGENCE--

26:16.139 --> 26:18.664
NOT MEN, OBVIOUSLY.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.753
NOT DRINKING OR DRUGS,

26:20.840 --> 26:23.669
BECAUSE YOU FEAR THAT THEY WILL
IMPAIR YOUR ABILITIES.

26:23.756 --> 26:25.888
YOU MOVE AROUND MUCH
TO HAVE A PET.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.804
SO MY GUESS...

26:28.891 --> 26:29.849
CHOCOLATE.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.417
YOU'RE GOOD.

26:33.504 --> 26:36.769
SO WHY DO YOU DO THIS, BROOKE?
NEGLECTED AS A CHILD?

26:36.856 --> 26:39.728
IS THIS YOUR WAY
OF GETTING ATTENTION?

26:39.815 --> 26:43.297
OR IS IT SOMETHING
A LITTLE DARKER?

26:43.384 --> 26:45.081
JUST A GENUINE MYSTERY,
I SUPPOSE.

26:45.168 --> 26:47.736
WE HAVE YOUR PRINTS,
WE'LL KNOW WHO YOU ARE SOON.

26:47.823 --> 26:51.566
DO YOU THINK ONE CAN EVER
TRULY KNOW ANOTHER PERSON?

26:51.653 --> 26:53.089
I DOUBT IT.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.396
HOW DO YOU COME TO HAVE
JIM GULBRAND'S KEY?

26:55.483 --> 26:57.616
HE GAVE IT TO ME.DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT IT WOULD UNLOCK?

26:57.703 --> 26:59.443
IT WASN'T GIVEN
AS A REAL KEY.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.968
IT WAS A SYMBOL...
OF OUR LOVE.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.534
IT'S THE KEY TO HIS HEART.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.973
YOU SAID "OUR LOVE"
WITH CONVICTION.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.759
SO, YOU'RE SAYING,
YOU LOVED HIM, TOO?

27:10.846 --> 27:13.719
YES, TO MY GREAT SURPRISE.

27:13.806 --> 27:16.896
I DID COME TO LOVE HIM,
IN A WAY.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.462
HE WAS A GOOD, KIND MAN.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.508
SO SWEET.YES, IT IS.

27:20.595 --> 27:24.207
YES, THIS IS ALSO THE KEY TO
A LOCKER THAT HOLDS $10 MILLION.

27:24.294 --> 27:26.645
REALLY? I THOUGHT
IT WAS FOR CIGARS.

27:26.732 --> 27:30.300
I LOVE A GOOD CIGAR.NOPE. $10 MILLION.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.825
BUT THAT'S JUST SILLY.

27:32.912 --> 27:35.262
WHY WOULD JIM KEEP $10 MILLION
IN A LOCKER?

27:37.177 --> 27:38.787
SHE'S GOOD.YEAH, SHE IS.

27:41.616 --> 27:44.532
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?DUH, LOOKING FOR THE MONEY.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.665
RICK FIGURED MAYBE
THERE WERE SECRET COMPARTMENTS

27:46.752 --> 27:48.884
ON THE BOAT OR SOMETHING.

27:48.971 --> 27:53.062
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING
RICK BREGMAN ROMANTICALLY?ABOUT A YEAR.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.586
YOU WERE DIVORCED FROM
JIM GULBRAND ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.764
WERE YOU AND RICK INVOLVED WHILE
YOU WERE STILL MARRIED TO JIM?

27:58.851 --> 27:59.852
INVOLVED?

28:01.418 --> 28:03.203
WERE YOU HAVING
SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH HIM?

28:03.290 --> 28:05.509
NO. RICK WOULD NEVER
DO THAT TO JIM.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.076
BUT YOU WOULD.

28:07.163 --> 28:08.948
I HAVE NEEDS
JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.993
I REFUSE TO BE
ASHAMED OF MY NEEDS.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.300
WHY DID YOU LIE TO US
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

28:13.387 --> 28:15.519
BECAUSE I KNEW
HOW IT WOULD LOOK.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.478
YOU KNEW IT'D MAKE
YOU LOOK GUILTY?

28:17.565 --> 28:19.872
NO. YES.
IT'S JUST...

28:22.483 --> 28:24.137
IT WASN'T JUST THAT.

28:24.224 --> 28:26.661
GAIA MATRIX'S STOCK
HAS BEEN FALLING FOR MONTHS.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.968
THIS MARKET HAS HURT
EVEN THE BEST OF COMPANIES.

28:29.055 --> 28:32.232
THE LAST THING I NEED IS
SOME "PAGE SIX" SEX SCANDAL.

28:32.319 --> 28:35.191
SO YOU MISLED US IN ORDER
TO PROTECT YOUR MONEY.

28:35.278 --> 28:36.976
I MISLED YOU TO PROTECT
THE COMPANY

28:37.063 --> 28:38.542
THAT JIM AND I BUILT.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.066
WERE YOU AWARE
THAT JIM GULBRAND

28:40.153 --> 28:42.416
WAS COOPERATING
WITH S.E.C. INVESTIGATORS?

28:42.503 --> 28:45.985
JIM WOULD NEVER GO
BEHIND MY BACK LIKE THAT.HE WOULD, AND HE DID.

28:46.072 --> 28:49.597
THE QUESTION IS, IF YOU
FOUND OUT, WHAT WOULD
YOU DO TO STOP HIM?

28:51.425 --> 28:54.471
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

28:54.558 --> 28:57.823
WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT
THE $10 MILLION HE WAS HIDING?

28:57.910 --> 28:58.954
OVER.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.307
[sighs]

29:04.394 --> 29:07.658
$10 MILLION?
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.140
OH, YEAH. JIM TRUSTED YOU WITH
THE SECURITY OF HIS COMPANY.

29:11.227 --> 29:14.796
HE VALUED YOUR, UH,
OUTSIDE-THE-BOX THINKING.

29:14.883 --> 29:18.234
YOU ADVISED HIM ON WHAT TO DO
WITH THE MONEY, DIDN'T YOU?

29:18.321 --> 29:19.845
DIDN'T YOU?

29:19.932 --> 29:21.629
WE DON'T CARE
IF HIDING THE MONEY

29:21.716 --> 29:23.413
WAS ILLEGAL OR UNETHICAL.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.720
OUR FOCUS IS
THE HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION.

29:25.807 --> 29:29.942
I-IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S JUST...

29:30.029 --> 29:32.422
I ABSOLUTELY PROMISED JIM
I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

29:34.816 --> 29:37.253
WE FOUND OUT JIM'S GIRLFRIEND,
BROOKE HARPER, IS A CONWOMAN.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.168
WE THINK SHE WAS
AFTER THE MONEY

29:39.255 --> 29:41.214
AND MIGHT HAVE MURDERED
JIM TO GET IT.

29:41.301 --> 29:43.651
WE FOUND HER,
ALONG WITH THIS KEY,

29:43.738 --> 29:47.742
TRYING TO OPEN GULBRAND'S
CABINET AT THE BACKGAMMON CLUB.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.876
THE KEY DIDN'T WORK.
EVIDENTLY, SHE TOOK IT FROM JIM,

29:50.963 --> 29:52.878
BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE THE MONEY IS.

29:52.965 --> 29:56.011
WOW. THAT'S SOME LADY.OH, YEAH.

29:56.098 --> 29:59.319
IF YOU HELP US FIND THE MONEY,
WE CAN PROVE THAT BROOKE WAS

29:59.406 --> 30:01.538
LOOKING FOR IT,
AND ESTABLISH A MOTIVE.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.933
[flips key]SO, STUART, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THE MONEY IS?

30:05.020 --> 30:07.240
NO.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.764
WELL, N-NOT EXACTLY, ANYWAY.

30:09.851 --> 30:13.942
JIM DID COME TO ME FOR SOME
OUT-OF-THE-BOX SECURITY ADVICE.

30:14.029 --> 30:17.032
LIKE YOU SAID, HE WANTED TO HIDE
THE MONEY FROM HIS EX-WIFE.

30:17.119 --> 30:19.556
I TOLD HIM THAT SAFETY DEPOSIT
BOXES AND OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS

30:19.643 --> 30:22.646
COULD BE TRACED RATHER EASILY,
SO THEY WOULDN'T BE OF ANY USE.

30:22.733 --> 30:25.519
SO WHERE'D
YOU TELL HIM TO HIDE IT?OFF THE GRID.

30:25.606 --> 30:26.999
OUT OF
THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,

30:27.086 --> 30:29.175
ANY PLACE A TRAIL
COULDN'T BE ESTABLISHED.

30:29.262 --> 30:33.179
LIKE A HOME SAFE?NO. ANYTHING ON HIS PROPERTY
IS SUBJECT TO SEARCH.

30:33.266 --> 30:36.095
NO, IT HAD TO BE SECURE--
OBVIOUSLY, HENCE THE KEY--

30:36.182 --> 30:39.402
IT HAD TO BE A PLACE
THAT NO ONE WOULD THINK TO LOOK.

30:39.489 --> 30:40.969
HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.754
YES. BUT THAT'S THE EXTENT
OF MY INVOLVEMENT.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.367
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE
HE ACTUALLY HID THE MONEY.OH, YEAH. I SEE.

30:47.454 --> 30:48.411
[key clatters]

30:48.498 --> 30:51.197
OH. [grunts] OOPSY.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.373
YEAH.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.897
DON'T WANT TO GO LOSING THAT,
NOW DO WE? [chuckles]

30:57.638 --> 30:59.161
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?

30:59.248 --> 31:01.511
YOU THINK HE KNOWS
WHERE JIM HID THE MONEY?

31:01.598 --> 31:04.036
I THINK HE KNOWS THE GENERAL
WHEREABOUTS OF THE MONEY,

31:04.123 --> 31:05.689
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW EXACTLY.

31:05.776 --> 31:08.867
AND THE DEVIL IS
IN THE DETAILS, ISN'T HE?

31:19.747 --> 31:21.357
[Jane clears throat]

31:21.444 --> 31:22.706
[claps hands]HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.795
I'M ALL EARS.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.015
TWO WEEKS AGO,
YOU TOOK THE LOCKER KEY

31:27.102 --> 31:29.452
FROM AROUND JIM'S NECK
WHEN HE WAS SLEEPING

31:29.539 --> 31:31.411
AND REPLACED IT
WITH AN IDENTICAL ONE

31:31.498 --> 31:33.282
SO JIM WAS NONE THE WISER.

31:33.369 --> 31:36.024
THEN WHEN YOU TRIED TO OPEN
THE LOCKER AT THE GYM,

31:36.111 --> 31:37.808
THE KEY DIDN'T FIT.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.854
THE MONEY WAS HIDDEN
SOMEWHERE ELSE, BUT WHERE?

31:39.941 --> 31:42.726
LAST FRIDAY,
YOU GOT IMPATIENT,

31:42.813 --> 31:46.034
AND YOU PUSHED JIM TO TELL YOU
WHERE HE'D HIDDEN THE MONEY.

31:46.121 --> 31:49.168
JIM WOULDN'T TELL YOU.
YOU GOT MAD, AND YOU KILLED HIM.

31:49.255 --> 31:50.909
NO.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.607
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T DO IT
ON PURPOSE, DID YOU?

31:53.694 --> 31:56.044
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.IT WASN'T.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.219
I DIDN'T DO IT.

31:59.439 --> 32:01.223
SAD THING IS,

32:01.310 --> 32:03.269
WITH ALL YOUR SKILLS,

32:03.356 --> 32:06.446
THE ANSWER WAS RIGHT THERE
IN FRONT OF YOU.[key clatters]

32:06.533 --> 32:07.926
YOU JUST DIDN'T SEE IT.

32:10.754 --> 32:13.105
YOU DIDN'T DO
ENOUGH RESEARCH.

32:13.192 --> 32:14.845
YOU'RE PLAYING ME.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.760
YOU DON'T KNOW EITHER.

32:16.847 --> 32:19.328
JIM'S SECURITY SYSTEMS ARE
ALL DESIGNED BY THE SAME MAN

32:19.415 --> 32:22.114
AT GAIA MATRIX.STUART HANSON.

32:22.201 --> 32:24.159
HIM. HE SUGGESTED
WHERE TO PUT THE MONEY.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.205
YOU COULD'VE SQUEEZED
THE TRUTH OUT OF HIM

32:26.292 --> 32:29.164
VERY SWIFTLY, I IMAGINE--
PUTTY TO A WOMAN LIKE YOU--

32:29.251 --> 32:32.254
BUT INSTEAD,
YOU HAD TO KILL A MAN.

32:32.341 --> 32:34.648
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.606
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

32:36.693 --> 32:39.740

32:39.827 --> 32:41.785
FATHER RYAN, SALESMAN...

32:41.872 --> 32:44.832
MOTHER DEBBIE, HOMEMAKER...

32:44.919 --> 32:48.967
TWO MISS TEEN TEMECULA
COUNTY TITLES. WOW.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.360
VARSITY SOFTBALL...

32:51.447 --> 32:54.320
CHURCH CHOIR SOLOIST.

32:54.407 --> 32:57.279
THEN YOU DISAPPEARED OFF
THE RECORDS FOR A COUPLE YEARS,

32:57.366 --> 32:59.064
AND WHEN YOU CAME BACK,

32:59.151 --> 33:01.892
YOU WERE A CON ARTIST
WITH TWO FRAUD CONVICTIONS.

33:08.638 --> 33:09.639
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:09.726 --> 33:12.033
NOTHING HAPPENED.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.687
I LIKE MONEY,

33:13.774 --> 33:15.297
AND I'M EASILY BORED.

33:16.907 --> 33:20.128
THERE'S GOTTA BE MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.304
IT'S A COLD, HARD,
LONELY LIFE YOU LEAD.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.569
WHAT IS IT THAT DRIVES YOU?

33:27.788 --> 33:29.224
PASSION FOR EXCELLENCE.

33:36.710 --> 33:38.712
OKAY.

33:38.799 --> 33:40.714
RELAX A WHILE.

33:40.801 --> 33:43.499
UH, AN AGENT WILL BE IN
HERE TO RUN YOU THROUGH

33:43.586 --> 33:45.893
THE FORMAL CHARGES AGAINST YOU.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.808
RUN AWAY.

33:47.895 --> 33:49.157
GOOD LUCK, LINDSEY.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.247
AND TO YOU.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.911
ANY LUCK WITH HARPER?

34:03.998 --> 34:06.566
THERE'S NO LUCK INVOLVED.
THE OUTCOME'S A GIVEN.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.002
IS THAT SO?

34:08.089 --> 34:09.264
YEAH, IT'S ALL
APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY

34:09.351 --> 34:10.309
AND NEWTONIAN PHYSICS.

34:33.941 --> 34:36.422
EXCUSE ME. MA'AM?
CAN I SEE SOME I.D., PLEASE?

34:36.509 --> 34:38.424
YOU CALL THAT A UNIFORM SHIRT?
IT'S FILTHY.

34:38.511 --> 34:42.384
I TRIED TO CLEAN--FILTHY. NO EXCUSES, STILES.

34:42.471 --> 34:44.517
I WILL ADDRESS THIS MATTER
WITH YOUR CAPTAIN

34:44.604 --> 34:45.866
AT MY EARLIEST CONVENIENCE.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.058
IS SHE ON THE MOVE YET?

35:04.145 --> 35:06.843
SHE MADE ONE STOP AND HASN'T
LEFT HER MOTEL ROOM SINCE.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.542
WHAT'D SHE STOP FOR?CHOCOLATE.

35:09.629 --> 35:12.110
OH, AND, UH, THANK YOU.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.720
FOR WHAT?

35:13.807 --> 35:15.765
FOR JUST LETTING THIS
PLAY OUT LIKE THIS.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.855
WE WOULD'VE HAD TO LET HER
GO ON THE MURDER CHARGE ANYWAY.

35:18.942 --> 35:20.770
NO PROOF TO KEEP HER ON.

35:20.857 --> 35:23.556
AND BESIDES, THIS IS A SIMPLE
PLAN. IT'S WHEN YOU START

35:23.643 --> 35:25.949
GETTING COSTUMES AND PROPS
THAT I GET NERVOUS.

35:26.036 --> 35:29.257
TRICK PLAYS LIKE THIS? MY DAD
CALLS THEM CHEWING GUM PLAYS.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.824
SOMETIMES YOU FOOL
THE OTHER GUY,

35:30.911 --> 35:33.087
AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST GET GUM
IN YOUR HAIR.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.306
SHE'S MOVING.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.357
TRAIN STATION.

35:42.444 --> 35:44.707
IT HAD TO BE
A TRAIN STATION.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.622
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE TRAIN STATION?

35:46.709 --> 35:51.671
PEOPLE, NOISE, TUNNELS, TRAINS,
MORE PEOPLE.[beeps]

35:51.758 --> 35:54.195
HER VEHICLE'S STOPPED
OUTSIDE THE STATION.

35:54.282 --> 35:57.372
[Lisbon] Hold your positions
until I give you the word.

35:57.459 --> 35:58.460
YES, BOSS. STANDING BY.

36:00.462 --> 36:01.420
COPY THAT.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.296
ALL SET.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.476
CHEWING GUM PLAYS.
I CAN ALREADY SEE MY HAIR

36:14.563 --> 36:16.261
WITH A BIG CHUNK OUT OF IT.

36:16.348 --> 36:17.827
YOU'D LOOK GOOD
WITH SHORT HAIR.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.133
CHOPPY--
KIND OF PETER PAN--

36:19.220 --> 36:20.917
GOOD FOR THE EYES.[beep]

36:21.004 --> 36:24.051
OKAY, HEADS-UP. SHE'S IN MOTION,
APPROACHING THE STATION NOW.

36:24.138 --> 36:25.618
CHO, DO YOU HAVE A VISUAL?

36:29.012 --> 36:30.666
AFFIRMATIVE. SHE'S EXITING
THE VEHICLE NOW.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.377
SHE HAS STUART HANSON
WITH HER.

36:49.511 --> 36:52.340
SHE HAS A GUN. BE ADVISED--
BROOKE HARPER IS ARMED.

36:53.472 --> 36:56.388
[indistinct conversations]

36:56.475 --> 36:58.346
[Lisbon] Rigsby, Van Pelt,
what's your status?

36:58.433 --> 37:00.305
I HAVE HARPER
AND HANSON IN SIGHT.

37:00.392 --> 37:01.828
VAN PELT,
SHE'S MOVING YOUR WAY.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.351
GOT 'EM.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.353
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S HEADED TO
THE COMMUTER LOCKERS.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.681
[thud]

37:28.768 --> 37:31.205
IT'S THE GATE.
I'M STUCK.

37:31.292 --> 37:33.381
[lowered voice]
ALRIGHT, DON'T MOVE.

37:33.468 --> 37:35.731
DON'T DO ANYTHING
AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

37:35.818 --> 37:37.342
THIS BETTER BE
THE RIGHT PLACE.

37:51.834 --> 37:54.184
SHE OPENED THE LOCKER.
SHE HAS THE MONEY.

37:56.012 --> 37:58.841
OKAY, I--UH, WAIT.
JUST--JUST WAIT A MOMENT.

38:06.719 --> 38:07.763
OH, MY.

38:10.636 --> 38:12.420
DON'T MOVE OR I'LL KILL YOU.

38:23.779 --> 38:24.737
DON'T MOVE!

38:27.087 --> 38:28.480
SH...[crowd gasps]

38:32.397 --> 38:34.660
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT, HANSON.

38:34.747 --> 38:36.618
I GOT HIM. EXCUSE ME.

38:36.705 --> 38:37.793
GUN.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.805
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST... AGAIN.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.334
COME ON, LET'S GO.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.163
YOU GOOD?YEAH.

39:06.213 --> 39:10.304
JASON BRADSHAW, JASON WADE,
ANTHONY WADE,

39:10.391 --> 39:13.002
ANTHONY SAMUELS,
THE LIST GOES ON--

39:13.089 --> 39:15.135
ALL ALIASES YOU'VE USED

39:15.222 --> 39:17.964
IN SCAMS RANGING FROM
IDENTITY THEFT TO PONZI SCHEMES.

39:18.051 --> 39:20.488
YOU'RE QUITE THE VIRTUOSO.THANK YOU.

39:21.924 --> 39:23.665
BUT THIS ONE--
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN

39:23.752 --> 39:25.885
YOUR MOST DARING
AND SUCCESSFUL CRIME YET.

39:25.972 --> 39:28.888
$10 MILLION
OF JIM GULBRAND'S MONEY.

39:30.890 --> 39:32.805
GULBRAND WAS
THE PERFECT MARK--

39:32.892 --> 39:35.547
RICH, LIQUID
AND UNCONVENTIONAL.

39:35.634 --> 39:38.637
I BET HE DIDN'T EVEN CHECK YOUR
REFERENCES WHEN HE HIRED YOU.

39:38.724 --> 39:41.117
NOTHING SAYS TRUSTWORTHY
LIKE A WHEELCHAIR.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.165
YOU CONVINCED GULBRAND
THAT THE TRAIN STATION WAS

39:45.252 --> 39:46.993
A GENIUS PLACE
TO HIDE HIS MONEY.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.126
SCREW ORTHODOX WISDOM.

39:50.213 --> 39:52.825
THINK SIDEWAYS, RIGHT?

39:52.912 --> 39:54.217
RIGHT?

39:54.304 --> 39:57.656
AND HE ATE IT UP.
HE ATE IT UP.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.353
WHY WOULDN'T HE?

39:59.440 --> 40:01.529
THEN YOU SIMPLY NEEDED
TO GET THE KEY.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.449
[Jane] YOU WENT TO THE YACHT
THAT NIGHT

40:08.536 --> 40:10.320
BECAUSE YOU KNEW HE'D BE ALONE.

40:17.589 --> 40:19.939
YOU ALSO KNEW HE KEPT
THE KEY WITH HIM.

40:21.723 --> 40:23.421
YOU DID WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE.

40:23.508 --> 40:27.120
YOU KILLED JIM GULBRAND.

40:27.207 --> 40:29.557
THEN YOU GOT RID OF THE BODY.

40:29.644 --> 40:31.037
[anchor rattles]

40:43.876 --> 40:46.748
BUT YOU DIDN'T COUNT
ON BROOKE HARPER.

40:46.835 --> 40:50.056
YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN
SHE SWAPPED THE REAL KEY...

40:50.143 --> 40:51.579
WITH A LOOK-ALIKE.

40:51.666 --> 40:53.363
YOU DIDN'T REALIZE
ANYTHING WAS WRONG

40:53.451 --> 40:56.279
UNTIL YOU TRIED
TO OPEN THE LOCKER.

40:56.366 --> 41:00.458
IT WASN'T UNTIL
WE CAME TO GAIA MATRIX

41:00.545 --> 41:02.503
WITH THE REAL KEY...

41:02.590 --> 41:04.853
THAT IT DAWNED ON YOU
WHAT SHE'D DONE.

41:04.940 --> 41:08.509
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
YOUR SURPRISE.

41:08.596 --> 41:12.121
SIX MONTHS
LIVING IN THAT CHAIR.

41:12.208 --> 41:15.081
SIX MONTHS, AND NO ONE
EVER QUESTIONED ME ABOUT IT.

41:15.168 --> 41:16.474
WHY DID YOU?

41:16.561 --> 41:18.998
WHENEVER I MEET
SOMEONE IN A WHEELCHAIR,

41:19.085 --> 41:21.870
I CHECK THE BOTTOMS
OF THEIR SHOES.

41:21.957 --> 41:23.481
[speaks inaudibly]

41:28.573 --> 41:31.663
THE BOTTOMS OF YOUR SHOES...

41:31.750 --> 41:32.838
WERE SCUFFED.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.320
[chuckles] I'VE BEEN
CHECKING SHOES FOR YEARS.

41:37.407 --> 41:40.454
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IT'S EVER PAID OFF. FIRST TIME.

41:40.541 --> 41:44.458
THAT'S GRATIFYING, MAN.
VERY,VERY GRATIFYING.

41:44.545 --> 41:45.764
YEAH.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.161
OH, HE'S A PISTOL, ISN'T HE?

42:02.476 --> 42:04.130
HEY.

42:04.217 --> 42:05.261
SORRY ABOUT THE CUFFS.

42:06.698 --> 42:08.395
MY OWN FAULT.OH, YEAH.

42:11.311 --> 42:15.402
[clicks tongue] WISH I COULD LET
YOU GO AGAIN, BUT YOU KNOW...

42:15.489 --> 42:17.796
I UNDERSTAND.

42:17.883 --> 42:21.234
THAT URGE YOU HAVE
TO GET ONE OVER ON PEOPLE,

42:21.321 --> 42:25.586
THE NEED TO BE SMARTER
THAN THE NEXT GUY...

42:25.673 --> 42:27.370
IT'LL KEEP BITING YOU
ON THE ASS.

42:27.457 --> 42:30.765
SO MY BUTT'LL HURT
OCCASIONALLY.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.811
I'LL STILL BE SMARTER
THAN THE NEXT GUY.

42:35.901 --> 42:37.729
BROOKE HARPER?

42:37.816 --> 42:40.253
NO, JESSICA WATERS.
TH-THAT'S HARPER RIGHT THERE.

42:41.994 --> 42:43.822
UH, AGENT?

42:43.909 --> 42:44.953
THIS IS HARPER.

42:46.694 --> 42:48.174
WORTH A TRY.OF COURSE.

42:48.261 --> 42:50.045
BROOKE HARPER,
I'M AGENT FRED HAYES.

42:50.132 --> 42:51.830
I'LL BE IN CHARGE
OF TRANSPORTING YOU

42:51.917 --> 42:53.701
TO THE FEDERAL DETENTION
CENTER IN DAVIS.

42:53.788 --> 42:54.702
AH!

42:56.704 --> 42:57.705
LET'S GO.

43:03.842 --> 43:05.974
[lowered voice]
SEE YOU AROUND, PATRICK.

43:06.061 --> 43:08.237
[Fred] I DOUBT YOU'LL
BE SEEING MUCH OF ANYBODY

43:08.324 --> 43:09.761
FOR A FEW YEARS.

43:09.848 --> 43:11.806
OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,
AGENT HAYES.

43:11.893 --> 43:13.808
SHE'S VERY GOOD
AT WHAT SHE DOES.

43:15.810 --> 43:17.072
[Fred] YEAH.
