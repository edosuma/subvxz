15:44.923 --> 15:47.422

My wife's folks came by
on the day.

15:59.923 --> 16:01.255
Her mom brought a fruitcake,

16:01.339 --> 16:03.255
could have been used
by the pharaohs.

16:03.339 --> 16:05.005
Kids cried
when I made them eat it.

16:11.047 --> 16:12.381
You got a kid, right?

16:12.464 --> 16:13.673
Yeah, lives with his mom.

16:13.756 --> 16:15.631
Well, you spent Christmas
with them, right?

16:15.714 --> 16:16.964
-No.
-Well, how come?

lonely or something, Virgil?

16:27.589 --> 16:28.798

16:28.881 --> 16:32.130
Well, if happy's drowning
in panties and a matching bra,

16:32.214 --> 16:33.255
yeah, why not?

16:34.547 --> 16:36.547
He was wearing man clothes
on the outside.

16:42.297 --> 16:43.714

16:43.798 --> 16:45.172

in what capacity were you hired

17:16.172 --> 17:17.673
-by the defense?
-I was hired

17:17.756 --> 17:18.923
as a private investigator.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.839
And is that,
these private investigations,

17:21.923 --> 17:24.589
the current means
by which you earn a living?

17:24.673 --> 17:27.172
-You know it is, Fenton.
-(JUDGE CLEARS THROAT)

17:27.255 --> 17:30.798
Um, pardon me.
Uh, yes, Mr. Bostwick.

17:30.881 --> 17:32.881
BOSTWICK: Now,
am I correct in asserting

17:32.964 --> 17:35.255
that you were recently cited
for assault?

17:39.005 --> 17:41.214
-Mr. Mason.
-I'm sorry. What?

17:41.297 --> 17:42.881
A complaint for assault.

17:42.964 --> 17:45.005
-This is irrelevant, Your Honor.
-BOSTWICK: I'm sure

17:45.089 --> 17:46.714
-that you resent this line--
-No, what I resent

17:46.798 --> 17:48.589
is Alvin Rutherford
showing up repeatedly

17:48.673 --> 17:50.673
and offering me pennies
on the dollar for a home

17:50.756 --> 17:52.214

with his own hands.

17:52.297 --> 17:54.798
Tragic, Mr. Mason, but assault?

17:56.089 --> 17:57.547
I threw a cowpie at him.

17:57.631 --> 17:59.756
(LAUGHTER)

17:59.839 --> 18:01.214
BOSTWICK: That's funny.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.673
However, far less amusing

18:03.756 --> 18:07.089
is the dishonorable end
to your military career.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.089
That has nothing to do
with this trial.

18:11.172 --> 18:13.589
BOSTWICK: A blue discharge
for conduct unbecoming.

18:13.673 --> 18:15.923
Would you care to elaborate
on that, Mr. Mason?

18:16.005 --> 18:19.130
-Was that a mistake?
-Feel free to jump in, Frank.

18:19.506 --> 18:21.547
Objection.

18:21.631 --> 18:23.881
-Question of relevance.
-You're goddamn right.

18:23.964 --> 18:25.089
JUDGE: Sustained.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.881
-Watch the God talk, sir.
-Sorry.

18:26.964 --> 18:28.089
BOSTWICK:
Nothing further, Your Honor.

The meeting's changed.

18:32.214 --> 18:33.798
We're going to Pasadena now.

18:33.881 --> 18:35.422
We are?
Fine, we can take my truck.

18:35.506 --> 18:38.506
We could if the plan was to make
the world's worst impression.

18:38.589 --> 18:39.881
Oh, I don't have to
plan for that.

18:39.964 --> 18:41.214
That happens naturally.

18:41.297 --> 18:43.130
I'll say, you were just four
words from contempt of court.

18:43.214 --> 18:45.255
Go fuck yourself.
I could have got that in.

and the judge is concerned

18:52.172 --> 18:54.297
with my decorum?
Why didn't he hold him

18:54.381 --> 18:56.422
in contempt?
Because I sure as hell did.

Letting him dig into me
like that.

Do you intend
to take notes, Miss?

19:21.798 --> 19:23.631

That's generally what I do.

19:23.714 --> 19:25.422
Unless you object.

19:26.297 --> 19:28.464
And you're a detective,
Mr. Mason?

for a busybody, but yes.

since, uh... when was it?

19:35.255 --> 19:36.756
Just after the war.

19:36.839 --> 19:39.172
Gave him his first job back
from France,

19:39.255 --> 19:41.798
-isn't that right, Perry?
-HERMAN: You served overseas?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.214
With lots of other farm boys.

Mr. Mason was in the army,

survived
the Battle of the Argonne.

How can we help you,
Mr. Baggerly?

19:50.923 --> 19:53.756

that needs help, Mr. Mason.

Matthew and Emily Dodson,

19:57.089 --> 19:59.547

19:59.631 --> 20:02.005

they're quite overwhelmed.

that she changed my life.

you contacted me, Herman?

20:33.422 --> 20:36.673
They're anxiously
awaiting your guidance, Elias.

20:36.756 --> 20:38.005
What about the police?

20:39.631 --> 20:40.714
How's that?

20:40.798 --> 20:42.714
Well, they'll be
on this hammer and tongs.

20:42.798 --> 20:44.089
Why not leave it to them?

20:48.839 --> 20:50.422
