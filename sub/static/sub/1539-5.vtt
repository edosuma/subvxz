WEBVTT

00:00.973 --> 00:03.913
There's a war coming, a terrible war.

00:03.947 --> 00:05.548
There will be chaos.

00:05.582 --> 00:06.683
Rivers of blood in the streets.

00:06.717 --> 00:07.884
I know it.

00:07.918 --> 00:09.052
I-I can see it coming.

00:09.086 --> 00:10.687
It's time.

00:10.721 --> 00:13.823
Somebody has to take over.
It might as well be me.

00:15.693 --> 00:18.261
I'm looking for a connection
between the Arkham plan

00:18.295 --> 00:19.495
and the murders of my parents.

00:19.530 --> 00:20.530
If Maroni gets even

00:20.564 --> 00:22.598
a piece of Arkham,

00:22.633 --> 00:24.200
it will prove Falcone is weak.

00:24.234 --> 00:26.536
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

00:26.570 --> 00:29.038
Hello, James, old friend.

00:29.073 --> 00:30.573
I told you never to come back here!

00:30.607 --> 00:32.375
Nobody looks for a dead man.

00:32.409 --> 00:35.345
- So, you want the job or what?
- Yes.

00:35.379 --> 00:37.447
I ain't looking for no girl.

00:37.481 --> 00:38.614
I'm looking for a weapon.

00:38.649 --> 00:40.049
Falcone thinks he can hit me,

00:40.084 --> 00:41.784
in my place of business,

00:41.819 --> 00:42.719
and get away with it?

00:42.753 --> 00:43.886
I want to hit him back.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

00:53.664 --> 00:54.931
Fancy a stroll?

00:54.965 --> 00:57.800
It's a lovely day.

00:57.835 --> 01:00.336
Stretch the legs, breath of fresh air.

01:00.371 --> 01:01.704
Busy.

01:01.739 --> 01:05.875
I've got a question for you, Master Bruce.

01:05.909 --> 01:09.078
What if all this was a complete

01:09.113 --> 01:11.281
and utter bloody waste of time?

01:12.683 --> 01:15.285
What if you never discovered
who killed your mom and dad?

01:15.319 --> 01:18.655
Hmm?

01:18.689 --> 01:23.226
What if you never get to wreak revenge?

01:23.260 --> 01:26.462
I don't want revenge.

01:26.497 --> 01:29.232
I want to understand how it all works.

01:29.266 --> 01:30.600
How Gotham works.

01:30.634 --> 01:32.035
Well, you'd have more chance

01:32.069 --> 01:34.003
digging to China with a teaspoon.

01:34.038 --> 01:35.905
Take the Arkham project for instance.

01:35.940 --> 01:37.974
How did the Falcone and Maroni

01:38.008 --> 01:40.610
crime families get such
big shares in the deal?

01:40.644 --> 01:41.911
I mean,

01:41.946 --> 01:43.479
I know City Hall is corrupt,

01:43.514 --> 01:46.816
but why didn't Wayne
Enterprises do something?

01:48.152 --> 01:50.119
Can you pass me that
blue folder over there?

01:54.158 --> 01:57.026
Well, I suppose as hobbies go,

01:57.061 --> 01:59.162
this is damn sight better

01:59.196 --> 02:02.999
than grilling yourself
like a bloody pork chop.

02:03.033 --> 02:05.468
Still, not particularly healthy, is it?

02:05.502 --> 02:07.704
Thank you.

02:07.738 --> 02:11.039
Are you listening to me?

02:11.075 --> 02:12.609
Y-Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

02:12.643 --> 02:15.144
I'll take a walk later. Thank you, Alfred.

02:21.719 --> 02:23.686
I won a piece of Arkham.

02:23.721 --> 02:25.388
I strong-armed the mayor.

02:25.422 --> 02:26.956
I made Falcone back down.

02:26.991 --> 02:30.159
And you're telling me that
I can't rob a lousy casino?

02:30.194 --> 02:33.963
Sal, the casino is Falcone's pride and joy.

02:33.998 --> 02:35.531
I mean, what's the point?

02:35.566 --> 02:37.433
For a few thousand bucks,
why mess with Falcone?

02:37.468 --> 02:39.135
That's the point.

02:39.169 --> 02:40.803
Messing with Falcone.

02:40.838 --> 02:42.906
I want him and his people to
know we're not backing off.

02:42.940 --> 02:45.008
Arkham was only the beginning.

02:45.042 --> 02:46.676
We're taking over, Frankie.

02:46.710 --> 02:48.177
Inch by inch.

02:48.212 --> 02:50.446
- Okay, but...
- But, but, but!

02:50.481 --> 02:53.449
- Make it happen.
- Okay, boss.

03:01.292 --> 03:04.027
What are you looking at?
You got something to say?

03:04.061 --> 03:07.096
No, sir. Nothing at all.

03:19.877 --> 03:22.212
Here you go, buddy.

03:46.003 --> 03:47.136
Hey!

03:47.171 --> 03:49.038
Hey, man!

04:49.467 --> 04:51.100
Hey!

04:53.237 --> 04:55.171
Hey! You got to pay for that!

04:57.608 --> 05:01.478
Do not vex me, mortal.

05:01.512 --> 05:02.846
Yeah?

05:04.582 --> 05:06.583
Suit yourself, Zeus.

05:18.062 --> 05:21.698
Hey, might look like the
heel of a hobo's shoe...

05:21.732 --> 05:23.600
best burgers in Midtown. Huh, Ephraim?

05:23.634 --> 05:24.734
If you say so.

05:24.768 --> 05:26.836
All right, I want two cheeseburgers,

05:26.871 --> 05:29.339
uh, hold the sauce, extra
pickles, two malted shakes.

05:29.373 --> 05:30.707
No pickles on mine, please.

05:30.741 --> 05:32.509
Oh, you got to trust me on this one, Jim.

05:32.543 --> 05:35.345
Yeah? All right. Pickles, bring 'em.

05:43.154 --> 05:45.188
All right, now,
you want to look good

05:45.222 --> 05:46.523
in a swimsuit like me come summertime,

05:46.557 --> 05:48.925
you're gonna want a lot of
this and a lot of this, huh?

05:48.959 --> 05:50.527
Is that right?

05:53.531 --> 05:54.330
You!

05:54.365 --> 05:55.565
Hey!

06:04.909 --> 06:06.409
Jim!

06:06.444 --> 06:08.111
Come on, it's lunchtime. Relax!

06:10.781 --> 06:12.415
It's lunchtime!

06:12.450 --> 06:16.886
No, Jim. We're on our... It-it's lunch!

06:16.921 --> 06:18.555
Oh, brother.

06:18.589 --> 06:22.025
Jim, can't just pop up and
jump every time you hear a bell.

06:26.730 --> 06:28.865
GCPD! Anybody here?

06:28.899 --> 06:30.767
Over... over here.

06:33.471 --> 06:35.105
You all right, sir?

06:35.139 --> 06:36.506
You okay?

06:36.540 --> 06:39.209
- Thank God you're here.
- Anybody dead?

06:39.243 --> 06:40.510
I don't think so.

06:40.544 --> 06:42.779
Some guy, he was stealing milk.

06:42.813 --> 06:44.047
I try to stop him,

06:44.081 --> 06:46.082
he hauls away my ATM machine.

06:46.117 --> 06:47.517
All right, nobody dead.

06:47.551 --> 06:49.419
We're homicide, and it's lunch.

06:49.453 --> 06:51.154
So have a good day, sir.

06:51.188 --> 06:53.089
Call 911, and someone
will take good care of you.

06:53.124 --> 06:55.091
Wait a minute, wait a
minute. One guy did this?

06:55.126 --> 06:56.726
Stole your ATM over milk?

06:56.761 --> 06:59.129
Little skinny-ass dude. Guitar case.

06:59.163 --> 07:01.564
Drinking milk like there's no more cows.

07:01.599 --> 07:03.800
"Don't vex me, mortal," he says.

07:03.834 --> 07:05.335
Sorry, what?

07:05.369 --> 07:07.804
Listen, if I had a
dollar for every hobo skeez

07:07.838 --> 07:09.472
that walks through that
door, thinks they're God,

07:09.507 --> 07:11.441
I wouldn't be here.

07:11.475 --> 07:14.544
But this son of a bitch,
he wasn't fooling around.

07:14.578 --> 07:16.880
All right, you get a
description of the vehicle,

07:16.914 --> 07:18.014
license plate, something?

07:18.049 --> 07:19.816
He didn't have a vehicle.

07:19.850 --> 07:22.085
Then how'd he pull your ATM from the wall?

07:22.119 --> 07:23.286
How'd he take it away?

07:23.320 --> 07:24.754
That's what I'm telling you, man.

07:24.789 --> 07:26.823
He pulled it out of
here with his bare hands.

07:54.547 --> 07:55.981
I'm bored.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.435
Poor little baby girl.

07:58.469 --> 08:00.570
Cooped up in here all the time.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.905
You want some excitement.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.641
Yes, I do. Can we just go somewhere and...?

08:06.277 --> 08:08.712
How's that? Excited now?

08:08.746 --> 08:10.514
What'd you do that for?

08:10.548 --> 08:12.449
Why are you here with me?

08:14.118 --> 08:15.819
I'm your secret weapon.

08:15.853 --> 08:17.387
Exactly.

08:17.421 --> 08:20.123
But are you helping me help you?

08:20.158 --> 08:21.525
No, you're not.

08:21.559 --> 08:23.460
You won't even learn the damn tune.

08:23.494 --> 08:26.363
I told you this is important.

08:26.397 --> 08:28.331
I'm sorry, mama.

08:28.366 --> 08:30.066
I'm not your mama.

08:30.101 --> 08:34.671
Now, you might be my baby
girl, but I'm not your mama.

08:34.705 --> 08:36.273
Not yet.

08:36.307 --> 08:39.275
You have to earn that.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.135
How is that even possible?

09:05.169 --> 09:07.737
- Who is this guy?
- No positive I.D.

09:07.772 --> 09:09.673
As of yet, he's a street guy.

09:09.707 --> 09:10.874
We think that

09:10.908 --> 09:13.710
this thing has something to do with his...

09:13.744 --> 09:15.812
excessive joi de vivre.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.681
Yeah, we found it in the
suspect's guitar case.

09:17.715 --> 09:18.849
It's some kind of drug.

09:18.883 --> 09:21.184
A drug did that?

09:21.219 --> 09:22.686
Wow.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.554
Nygma found traces of the drug.

09:24.589 --> 09:26.089
He'll have a read on what the hell

09:26.124 --> 09:27.290
this thing is by tomorrow morning.

09:27.325 --> 09:28.992
Meantime, we'll try
and I.D. the strong man.

09:29.026 --> 09:29.860
Yeah.

09:47.145 --> 09:49.679
I know your families are upset.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.981
But tell them

09:51.015 --> 09:53.183
everybody got a piece
of the Arkham project.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.818
It was a business decision.

09:54.852 --> 09:56.787
We didn't lose, Maroni didn't win.

09:56.821 --> 09:58.722
Maroni thinks he won.

09:58.756 --> 10:01.057
He thinks he won a great battle.

10:01.092 --> 10:04.094
- We need to hurt him.
- No.

10:04.128 --> 10:06.930
If we don't push back
hard, he's going to think...

10:06.964 --> 10:09.833
Nikolai, that fool will think
what I want him to think.

10:09.867 --> 10:11.635
No push back, not yet.

10:11.669 --> 10:14.171
In my country, we say,

10:14.205 --> 10:18.842
"Even a fool may bite the
king, if he has teeth."

10:18.876 --> 10:21.178
Can the folklore, Niko.

10:21.212 --> 10:23.513
We're not in your godforsaken country.

10:23.548 --> 10:27.217
We are here in Gotham, where
we have plumbing, electricity,

10:27.251 --> 10:29.352
and Don Falcone is the boss.

10:29.387 --> 10:30.754
He's playing

10:30.788 --> 10:33.390
that cluck Maroni on a long line. Done!

10:33.424 --> 10:35.525
Why so angry, Fish?

10:35.560 --> 10:37.861
I speak my mind. Is no crime.

10:37.895 --> 10:40.597
And I assure you, in my country,

10:40.631 --> 10:42.699
we have all modern conveniences.

10:42.734 --> 10:44.701
ladies.

10:44.736 --> 10:46.236
Ladies are in kitchen or in bed,

10:46.270 --> 10:48.305
depending on their talents.

10:48.339 --> 10:50.574
I bet your mother was a lousy cook.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.142
Don't speak of my mother.

10:52.176 --> 10:53.577
Or what?

10:55.012 --> 10:57.314
You gonna hit a lady?

10:57.348 --> 10:58.515
That's enough.

10:58.549 --> 11:00.550
There'll be no bad blood here.

11:00.585 --> 11:02.986
My apologies, Don Falcone.

11:03.021 --> 11:04.755
We need each other.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.957
We're family.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.668
Hey.

11:20.671 --> 11:22.439
Excuse me. You seen this guy by chance?

11:22.473 --> 11:23.840
Nah.

11:23.875 --> 11:24.975
Mm-mm.

11:25.009 --> 11:26.476
You seen this guy?

11:28.012 --> 11:29.112
Excuse me.

11:30.148 --> 11:32.516
Familiar to you, hmm?

11:32.550 --> 11:34.484
Any chance you've seen this guy?

11:34.519 --> 11:37.621
Yeah, I know him. That's, uh, Benny.

11:37.655 --> 11:41.391
He's a guitar player.
Strung out like string.

11:41.426 --> 11:44.394
- What'd he do?
- Uh, nothing bad.

11:44.429 --> 11:46.063
Uh, he came into an inheritance actually

11:46.097 --> 11:47.998
- no one knew about.
- That's right.

11:48.032 --> 11:50.767
Million dollars. Farm, horses, real nice.

11:50.802 --> 11:52.369
You know where can we find him?

11:52.403 --> 11:54.204
$20.

11:55.973 --> 11:57.874
Ten.

11:57.909 --> 11:59.743
Same as the bodega.

11:59.777 --> 12:03.180
Yeah, what's with all the dairy products?

12:08.586 --> 12:09.820
Sir?

12:09.854 --> 12:12.456
GCPD. Let me see those hands.

12:12.490 --> 12:14.591
Oh... help me.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.026
I need...

12:16.060 --> 12:17.694
more...

12:17.729 --> 12:19.529
More what? What'd you take?

12:19.564 --> 12:22.597
- What is it?
- It's... it felt so good.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.435
And now I-I don't feel so
good. Something's wrong.

12:25.470 --> 12:27.237
I need more!

12:27.271 --> 12:29.706
Please, you have to find him.

12:29.741 --> 12:30.774
Find who?

12:30.808 --> 12:32.676
The guy that gave you the stuff? Yeah!

12:32.710 --> 12:35.178
The man with a mangled ear.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.080
The mangled ear. I got him.

12:37.115 --> 12:39.216
Stay calm. We got it. Help me.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.684
We're gonna help. Just put your...

12:40.718 --> 12:42.886
- No, no, no, no!
- Hey, hey! Sir!

12:42.920 --> 12:45.389
Sir, we need you to calm down.

12:45.423 --> 12:46.456
Calm down. Please...

12:46.491 --> 12:47.524
Put your hands behind your back!

12:56.367 --> 12:58.302
I said no!

12:58.336 --> 12:59.736
Put it down!

13:21.759 --> 13:24.227
What the hell?

13:26.297 --> 13:29.766
God help us if that drug gets out.

13:56.408 --> 13:58.510
Will you look at this shambles?

14:01.981 --> 14:04.849
What would your mother say?

14:04.884 --> 14:07.318
You know, I have a half a mind to

14:07.353 --> 14:10.488
stick all this lot straight
into the bloody fire.

14:10.523 --> 14:12.857
- No fire.
- We'll see about that.

14:12.892 --> 14:15.126
Come on, up you get.

14:15.161 --> 14:17.295
Wayne Enterprises is hosting

14:17.329 --> 14:20.131
a charitable luncheon tomorrow.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.700
And I took the liberty of
accepting their kind invitation

14:22.735 --> 14:24.169
on your behalf, Master Bruce.

14:24.203 --> 14:25.770
Good.

14:25.804 --> 14:27.372
Is there breakfast?

14:27.406 --> 14:30.041
Yeah, I'll make you an egg.

14:30.075 --> 14:31.709
Does that mean you'll go?

14:31.744 --> 14:33.578
Yes.

14:33.612 --> 14:36.447
I have some questions I need
to ask the members of the board.

14:36.482 --> 14:39.717
- What kind of questions?
- About Arkham.

14:39.752 --> 14:41.352
It seems very likely those gangsters

14:41.387 --> 14:44.622
were actually given their shares
in Arkham by Wayne Enterprises.

14:44.657 --> 14:47.859
Well, that's how business
is done, isn't it?

14:47.893 --> 14:49.460
Is it?

14:51.464 --> 14:54.098
M-My parents didn't do business that way.

14:54.133 --> 14:56.734
- Did they?
- No.

14:56.769 --> 14:58.369
No, they didn't, Master Bruce.

14:58.404 --> 15:00.338
The board might not know, of course.

15:00.372 --> 15:02.841
There's quite a bit of
clever camouflage used.

15:02.875 --> 15:06.177
Shell companies, offshore
accounts and so forth.

15:06.212 --> 15:08.746
Right. So, you-you've...

15:08.781 --> 15:11.749
learned all that from all this, did you?

15:13.118 --> 15:15.019
Fantastic detective work.

15:15.054 --> 15:17.055
I still, however, want to get the whole lot

15:17.089 --> 15:18.890
and chuck it straight in the fire.

15:18.924 --> 15:20.992
Don't put anything in the fire, Alfred.

15:21.026 --> 15:23.428
That's an order.

15:23.462 --> 15:25.463
Right, Master Bruce.

15:27.466 --> 15:29.467
Nothing in the fire.

15:37.376 --> 15:39.544
We are
live in downtown Gotham

15:39.578 --> 15:42.380
where a deadly new drug
has hit the streets.

15:42.414 --> 15:45.750
Nicknamed "Viper," users
of this mystery drug

15:45.785 --> 15:48.386
acquire great strength and
a euphoric sense of power,

15:48.420 --> 15:50.822
but only for a few brief hours.

15:50.856 --> 15:54.292
Then, without exception,
they die a horrible death.

16:00.499 --> 16:01.699
Let me out!

16:05.471 --> 16:06.638
Get off me!

16:10.009 --> 16:12.777
Let go of me!

16:16.315 --> 16:18.116
Get your crummy hands off me!

16:23.689 --> 16:25.490
It's really quite remarkable.

16:25.524 --> 16:28.827
Viper somehow activates unused DNA.

16:28.861 --> 16:30.395
The body starts to burn calcium

16:30.429 --> 16:32.297
from the skeletal system as fuel.

16:32.331 --> 16:35.133
Hence the victims' cravings
for milk and cheese.

16:35.167 --> 16:38.236
They're desperately trying to
replace the missing calcium.

16:38.270 --> 16:40.138
But they can't consume enough.

16:40.172 --> 16:43.241
Essentially, their bones crumble.

16:43.275 --> 16:44.976
Then they suffocate and die.

16:45.010 --> 16:46.478
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

16:46.512 --> 16:48.446
No. Nobody has. Totally new.

16:48.481 --> 16:50.849
I cannot tell you how
thrilled I am to be...

16:50.883 --> 16:52.350
No new reports for a few hours now.

16:52.384 --> 16:54.719
Maybe they're done. Maybe
they ran out of the stuff.

16:54.754 --> 16:55.720
I doubt it.

16:55.755 --> 16:57.956
Who would put this on the street?

16:57.990 --> 16:58.957
Why?

16:58.991 --> 17:01.159
Th-They're not even selling
it. They're giving it away.

17:01.193 --> 17:03.294
That's how you create demand.

17:03.329 --> 17:04.996
For a drug that kills you that fast?

17:05.030 --> 17:06.664
Well, first it makes you king of the world.

17:06.699 --> 17:08.031
There'll be takers.

17:08.067 --> 17:09.467
There'll be mayhem, that's for sure.

17:09.502 --> 17:10.935
But it's skell-on-skell mayhem.

17:10.970 --> 17:12.369
If we keep the decent citizens indoors

17:12.405 --> 17:14.806
for a couple of weeks, let
the scumbags have at it,

17:14.839 --> 17:16.608
voilà... the end of crime.

17:16.642 --> 17:19.444
Yeah, that's a nice thought. But no.

17:19.478 --> 17:22.047
This stuff seems hard to make, no?

17:22.080 --> 17:24.015
Oh, it takes a high level
of technical sophistication.

17:24.050 --> 17:25.717
A state-of-the-art lab made this stuff.

17:25.751 --> 17:28.286
Okay, so who has the biggest
and best lab in the city?

17:28.319 --> 17:30.455
The best is WellZyn.

17:30.489 --> 17:32.123
But this is not them.

17:32.158 --> 17:34.125
They're a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.061
Multibillion-dollar corporation.

17:36.095 --> 17:37.529
Why would they be doing this?

17:37.563 --> 17:39.998
I don't know, but we might
as well start at the top.

17:41.834 --> 17:43.001
Grab her! Grab her!

17:43.035 --> 17:44.402
Come on, here! Let go of me!

17:44.437 --> 17:47.672
Get off me! Get off me!

17:59.385 --> 18:01.386
Fascinating.

18:02.388 --> 18:03.822
Fascinating!

18:03.856 --> 18:05.990
Breaking news. Continued mayhem...

18:06.025 --> 18:08.193
Maybe I should hire that
guy to take the casino.

18:08.227 --> 18:10.295
Maybe you should snort
some Viper, grow a pair.

18:10.329 --> 18:11.730
Either way, I want that casino taken.

18:11.764 --> 18:13.331
Sure, we'll take it.

18:13.366 --> 18:16.167
I mean, it's tight as
a nut... ten armed guards

18:16.202 --> 18:18.737
blast-proof doors, cameras.

18:18.771 --> 18:21.940
We're gonna lose a few
guys, but we'll take it.

18:21.974 --> 18:24.109
Excuse me, gentlemen.

18:24.143 --> 18:25.910
I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation

18:25.945 --> 18:27.178
regarding the casino.

18:27.213 --> 18:28.847
Go mind your business.

18:28.881 --> 18:30.648
I'm sorry. Of course. So sorry.

18:30.683 --> 18:34.219
No. Tell me, what about the casino?

18:35.621 --> 18:38.556
I know a janitor who runs
the boiler room of the casino.

18:38.591 --> 18:41.526
He could get you inside
quite easily, I believe.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.461
There are access tunnels
that nobody knows about.

18:43.496 --> 18:45.297
Access tunnels?

18:45.331 --> 18:47.399
Sit down. Come here.

18:47.433 --> 18:50.702
Thank you, sir. A great honor indeed.

18:50.736 --> 18:52.637
What's your name again?

18:52.672 --> 18:54.773
Everyone here calls me Penguin, sir.

18:54.807 --> 18:56.775
You don't like that name, huh?

18:58.444 --> 19:01.112
Yeah, well, you're wrong. It's a good name.

19:01.147 --> 19:03.148
Works for you.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.951
So how do you know this man?

19:06.986 --> 19:08.153
The janitor?

19:08.187 --> 19:11.556
- I have connections.
- Reliable, is he?

19:11.590 --> 19:13.792
I think I can persuade him to be.

19:13.826 --> 19:15.927
Boss, this guy is a dishwasher in a suit.

19:15.962 --> 19:17.729
Relax.

19:17.763 --> 19:19.831
Is that right, Penguin?

19:19.865 --> 19:22.100
Are you just a dishwasher?

19:22.134 --> 19:23.802
'Cause I don't get that vibe.

19:23.836 --> 19:26.004
You come off as all humble, but...

19:26.038 --> 19:28.239
you got a little player in you, huh?

19:28.274 --> 19:30.942
That's very perceptive
of you, sir.

19:30.977 --> 19:32.844
I guess that's why you're the don.

19:32.878 --> 19:34.846
Well...

19:34.880 --> 19:37.282
I'm not a dishwasher.

19:37.316 --> 19:40.919
And this isn't my first rodeo, so to speak.

19:43.022 --> 19:44.422
So, you've rode some bulls, huh?

19:44.457 --> 19:46.358
- Well...
- I knew it.

19:46.392 --> 19:47.993
Well, tell all, cowboy.

19:48.027 --> 19:51.463
Well, my real name is Oswald Cobblepot.

19:51.497 --> 19:52.464
Mm-hmm.

19:52.498 --> 19:54.332
And I think that once you hear my story,

19:54.367 --> 19:56.801
you'll agree that I could be
a great asset for you, sir.

19:56.836 --> 19:58.203
Hmm.

19:58.237 --> 20:00.171
It's a long, funny story really.

20:00.206 --> 20:03.108
But the headline, just
so you're not surprised...

20:04.310 --> 20:05.710
I used to work for Fish Mooney.

20:05.745 --> 20:07.612
Fish Mooney?

20:07.647 --> 20:09.047
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

20:09.081 --> 20:11.950
I was privy to many aspects
of the Falcone family business.

20:11.984 --> 20:14.286
Until they tried to kill me.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.520
Yeah, well...

20:15.554 --> 20:17.289
Hello.

20:17.323 --> 20:18.657
Suffice it to say...

20:21.093 --> 20:22.627
That is a funny story.

20:22.662 --> 20:24.129
Mm.

20:36.943 --> 20:38.376
I'm Taylor Reece,

20:38.411 --> 20:41.012
general counsel, public
relations for WellZyn.

20:41.047 --> 20:42.647
Good morning, gentlemen.

20:42.682 --> 20:45.350
Thank you for saving us a trip.

20:45.384 --> 20:48.186
We were en route as soon as we
were apprised of your inquiries.

20:48.221 --> 20:51.523
WellZyn is committed to
good community relations.

20:51.557 --> 20:52.757
What do you know about Viper?

20:52.792 --> 20:54.226
Only what we see on the news.

20:54.260 --> 20:57.028
WellZyn has no connection to this tragedy.

20:57.063 --> 20:58.663
We will vigorously pursue

20:58.698 --> 21:00.498
legal action against any individuals

21:00.533 --> 21:02.534
making assertions to the contrary.

21:02.568 --> 21:04.536
Do you think we push a button

21:04.570 --> 21:06.538
or does she just rewind automatically?

21:06.572 --> 21:08.773
We're looking for
an employee of WellZyn's.

21:08.808 --> 21:12.244
Male with a severely damaged ear.

21:13.312 --> 21:14.746
Y-Yes.

21:14.780 --> 21:18.049
Full disclosure... that does raise a flag.

21:24.957 --> 21:27.926
That's Stan Potolsky.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.529
He worked for us for several years

21:30.563 --> 21:32.163
as a biochemist.

21:32.198 --> 21:34.199
Uh, primarily personal care products.

21:34.233 --> 21:36.301
Shampoos, toothpastes.

21:36.335 --> 21:37.969
So what happened?

21:38.004 --> 21:39.771
Well, Stan was frustrated
that he wasn't doing

21:39.805 --> 21:41.106
more important work.

21:41.140 --> 21:44.276
He grew disgruntled and unstable.

21:44.310 --> 21:46.711
We tried to get him help, but he resisted.

21:46.746 --> 21:50.549
Last April, there was an incident.

21:51.450 --> 21:54.085
He tried to cut off his own ear

21:54.120 --> 21:57.422
during a disagreement with his supervisor.

21:58.457 --> 21:59.925
Guess it was harder than he thought.

21:59.959 --> 22:02.127
We had to let him go.

22:02.161 --> 22:03.728
Last known address?

22:03.763 --> 22:05.497
Well, after he was terminated,

22:05.531 --> 22:07.766
he didn't even clear off his desk.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.734
Just disappeared, off the grid.

22:09.769 --> 22:12.137
You knew, didn't you?

22:13.339 --> 22:14.639
You knew all along it was him.

22:14.674 --> 22:16.408
That's why you came to see us so fast.

22:16.442 --> 22:18.577
That's incorrect.

22:18.611 --> 22:21.146
Viper can only be produced
in a state-of-the-art lab,

22:21.180 --> 22:22.347
like yours.

22:22.381 --> 22:25.917
Stan Potolsky is a brilliant man,

22:25.952 --> 22:28.987
perfectly capable of building his own lab.

22:29.021 --> 22:30.956
But you are more than welcome to examine

22:30.990 --> 22:32.257
our facilities.

22:32.291 --> 22:34.759
With full and proper clearances, of course.

22:34.794 --> 22:36.027
Of course.

22:36.062 --> 22:38.296
We'll get the paperwork started.

22:40.466 --> 22:42.100
Lawyers.

22:42.135 --> 22:43.969
Scumbags, the lot of them.

22:44.003 --> 22:45.103
Yeah, some of them.

22:45.138 --> 22:46.538
Let's go find Stan Potolsky.

22:46.572 --> 22:48.340
What, drive around looking for him?

22:48.374 --> 22:51.443
No. I'll call dispatch,
have them put out an APB.

22:51.477 --> 22:53.078
All right, I'll check with the desk,

22:53.112 --> 22:55.614
see if his name's come up.

22:55.648 --> 22:58.617
- Gordon, right?
- Yeah. Who the hell are you?

22:58.651 --> 23:01.052
You got to come with me
now, nice and quiet like.

23:01.087 --> 23:02.187
What are you talking about?

23:02.221 --> 23:03.822
Relax. We got a mutual friend.

23:03.856 --> 23:07.225
- Oh, yeah, who's that?
- Oswald Cobblepot.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.828
Yeah, him.

23:09.862 --> 23:11.363
And if you don't come with me now,

23:11.397 --> 23:12.931
we're gonna put his head in a bag

23:12.965 --> 23:14.666
and send it to Falcone,

23:14.700 --> 23:16.902
which would be embarrassing for you, no?

23:18.905 --> 23:20.272
Or maybe we've been misinformed.

23:20.306 --> 23:22.474
I mean, if I'm not ringing any bells here,

23:22.508 --> 23:25.710
you can go on your merry way.

23:25.745 --> 23:28.346
No, I'll come.

23:36.622 --> 23:38.623
Come on, shove over.

23:39.625 --> 23:41.626
Hey! Hey!

23:57.942 --> 23:59.276
Welcome.

23:59.310 --> 24:01.178
I'm Salvatore Maroni.

24:01.212 --> 24:03.580
I know who you are.

24:03.614 --> 24:04.848
What do you want?

24:04.882 --> 24:05.849
Here's the thing...

24:05.883 --> 24:07.651
Jim, just tell the truth.

24:10.021 --> 24:11.788
You want a drink, Jim?

24:11.823 --> 24:13.190
I'm having a Negroni.

24:13.224 --> 24:14.624
So good with seafood.

24:14.659 --> 24:16.827
Water.

24:21.732 --> 24:24.301
So, our friend here told
me a fascinating story.

24:24.335 --> 24:25.869
Never heard a story so good.

24:25.903 --> 24:27.471
It's hard to believe it's true.

24:27.505 --> 24:30.207
- It is, it's true.
- Shut up! Shut up!

24:30.241 --> 24:32.409
One more word,

24:32.443 --> 24:34.678
and I'll jam this down your throat.

24:34.712 --> 24:36.379
I try to be civil, Jim.

24:37.815 --> 24:41.418
But I'm not the kind of
man that likes to ask twice.

24:41.452 --> 24:43.186
So here's how it's gonna go.

24:43.221 --> 24:45.322
Slow down, Mr. Maroni. I don't know...

24:45.356 --> 24:46.990
No! No. No.

24:47.024 --> 24:50.360
You let me finish. You'll
have your turn to speak.

24:52.964 --> 24:55.665
Okay, then.

24:57.068 --> 25:00.036
I want you to tell me the same exact story

25:00.071 --> 25:01.772
that Penguin told me.

25:01.806 --> 25:03.240
What story is that?

25:03.274 --> 25:05.442
Oh, you better know what story, my friend.

25:05.476 --> 25:08.311
Because if you tell me
the same story he told me,

25:08.346 --> 25:10.247
then I could believe it's true.

25:10.281 --> 25:12.415
Then I'm happy.

25:12.450 --> 25:15.418
But if you tell me another story, oh, mama.

25:15.453 --> 25:17.020
Then someone's lying to me.

25:17.922 --> 25:20.457
And I don't know which one,
and the both of youse will die.

25:20.491 --> 25:22.692
Understand?

25:22.727 --> 25:25.228
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

25:25.263 --> 25:26.363
So...

25:28.032 --> 25:30.634
Tell me a story, Jim.

25:33.604 --> 25:35.672
Somebody murdered Thomas and Martha Wayne.

25:35.706 --> 25:37.774
My partner and I caught the case.

25:37.809 --> 25:38.909
We didn't even know each other then...

25:38.943 --> 25:39.943
What did I say?!

25:39.977 --> 25:42.078
Go put him on the slicer.

25:42.113 --> 25:44.548
No, no, no.

25:44.582 --> 25:47.818
If I don't like what I
hear, slice his face prejute.

25:49.153 --> 25:52.222
Oh, I'm sorry. Go on.

25:54.926 --> 25:58.161
I was a pawn...

25:58.196 --> 26:00.130
in a conspiracy

26:00.164 --> 26:03.767
between Falcone, the mayor and the GCPD

26:03.801 --> 26:06.970
to frame Mario Pepper
for the Wayne murders,

26:07.004 --> 26:08.538
with the help of Fish Mooney,

26:08.573 --> 26:11.775
Mr. Cobblepot's employer at the time.

26:11.809 --> 26:15.679
Mr. Cobblepot then told
the whole story to the MCU.

26:17.982 --> 26:19.883
To prove that I wouldn't
betray the conspiracy,

26:19.917 --> 26:21.918
Falcone ordered me to kill Cobblepot.

26:24.422 --> 26:27.357
I didn't do it.

26:27.391 --> 26:29.860
I let him live.

26:29.894 --> 26:32.129
And here we are.

26:37.301 --> 26:39.603
Falcone, Mooney,

26:39.637 --> 26:42.139
the MCU cops...

26:42.173 --> 26:43.807
none of them know he's alive?

26:43.841 --> 26:45.709
If they did, I'd be dead already.

26:51.182 --> 26:52.749
It's delicious.

26:54.052 --> 26:57.320
Frankie! Bring the Penguin back out here.

26:57.355 --> 26:59.122
The little punk is telling the truth.

26:59.157 --> 27:00.557
Thank you, Jim.

27:00.591 --> 27:03.393
Good story. Told well.

27:03.428 --> 27:05.862
Lot of guys in your
situation, they freak out.

27:07.532 --> 27:08.665
There you are, you rat,

27:08.700 --> 27:11.435
you snitch, you gorgeous
turncoat son of a bitch.

27:11.469 --> 27:13.036
Come here, I love you. Mwah!

27:13.071 --> 27:14.371
Be happy, Frankie.

27:14.405 --> 27:16.840
We just got a brand-new
weapon against the Falcones.

27:16.874 --> 27:18.041
It's Christmas!

27:18.076 --> 27:19.776
Happy holidays. Can I go now?

27:19.811 --> 27:21.978
Oh, yeah, Jim, you can go.

27:23.781 --> 27:25.882
You know, just so that we, uh,

27:25.917 --> 27:27.384
understand each other,

27:27.418 --> 27:30.053
you know, keep all this hush-hush.

27:30.088 --> 27:32.289
Between us pals.

27:32.323 --> 27:35.425
And if I need you again, I'll call you.

27:38.196 --> 27:40.697
You do that.

27:44.135 --> 27:45.335
Look at you, come on.

27:45.370 --> 27:46.370
Let's get you cleaned up.

27:46.404 --> 27:47.437
Look at you. Come on.

27:51.109 --> 27:54.044
I love you, baby.

27:54.078 --> 27:56.413
I love you, baby.

27:56.447 --> 27:58.348
I love you, baby. Okay, now,

27:58.383 --> 28:00.450
you're still putting too much sex on it.

28:00.485 --> 28:02.452
Keep it clean.

28:02.487 --> 28:05.756
Like a mother.

28:05.790 --> 28:07.858
I love you, baby.

28:08.860 --> 28:11.261
I love you, baby.

28:11.295 --> 28:12.529
Good.

28:12.563 --> 28:14.031
Better.

28:14.065 --> 28:17.801
Now, act as if you've caught me in a lie.

28:19.237 --> 28:20.904
Not angry.

28:20.938 --> 28:24.207
No. Disappointment.

28:25.877 --> 28:27.911
Oh, honey.

28:28.913 --> 28:30.781
Oh, honey.

28:30.815 --> 28:32.916
There you go.

28:32.950 --> 28:35.452
Now, about your hair.

28:37.855 --> 28:39.823
There you are.

28:41.893 --> 28:44.227
Where the hell have you been?

28:44.262 --> 28:45.862
Personal business.

28:45.897 --> 28:47.798
You disappear in the middle of a case,

28:47.832 --> 28:49.266
you can't even tell me why?

28:49.300 --> 28:50.834
That's what "personal" means.

28:50.868 --> 28:53.003
You in some kind of trouble?

28:53.037 --> 28:54.905
Look, forget it. I don't
want to know your problems.

28:54.939 --> 28:56.473
WellZyn sent by Potolsky's stuff.

28:56.507 --> 28:58.909
- Grab a box.
- Anything useful yet?

28:58.943 --> 29:01.311
No. Classic geeky loner.

29:01.346 --> 29:02.679
Lived for his work.

29:02.714 --> 29:06.850
No wife, no family, no real friends.

29:06.884 --> 29:08.652
Is it Barbara?

29:09.621 --> 29:11.321
She get into something?

29:11.356 --> 29:12.889
Uh, yeah.

29:12.924 --> 29:14.458
Kind of.

29:14.492 --> 29:16.927
Figures. No offense.

29:16.961 --> 29:20.030
- Need any help?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

29:22.900 --> 29:24.034
Hey.

29:24.902 --> 29:26.403
What do you think about this?

29:26.437 --> 29:27.838
Looks like a friend, no?

29:32.176 --> 29:35.779
Judging by the books and the mascot,

29:35.813 --> 29:36.880
philosophy professor,

29:36.914 --> 29:39.216
Gotham U.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.617
Worth a shot.

29:40.652 --> 29:42.619
Amen.

29:46.491 --> 29:49.026
I was just on my way to an appointment,

29:49.060 --> 29:51.828
but yes, I know Stan Potolsky.

29:51.863 --> 29:53.563
He was a student of mine.

29:53.598 --> 29:56.333
A very brilliant student.

29:56.367 --> 29:58.435
And you've stayed
in touch over the years.

29:58.469 --> 30:01.171
We have. He may be a biochemist,

30:01.205 --> 30:03.640
but philosophy is a passion of his.

30:03.675 --> 30:06.543
What can you tell us
about WellZyn firing him?

30:06.577 --> 30:10.647
Research for WellZyn led him
into some dark moral corners.

30:10.682 --> 30:12.449
WellZyn said he made shampoo.

30:12.483 --> 30:14.217
Where are the dark moral corners in that?

30:14.252 --> 30:18.355
Shampoo?  They say that, do they?

30:18.389 --> 30:22.559
No, no, Stan designed
pharmaceutical weapons

30:22.594 --> 30:24.728
to be used by combat troops.

30:24.762 --> 30:27.164
Drugs that worked on an epigenetic level.

30:27.198 --> 30:28.632
Imagine an army

30:28.666 --> 30:31.835
made up of soldiers so strong
that they can tear a man apart

30:31.869 --> 30:33.537
with their bare hands.

30:33.571 --> 30:36.707
Of course, at the beginning,
there were side effects.

30:36.741 --> 30:38.242
Yeah, death.

30:38.276 --> 30:39.610
But Viper was the first batch.

30:39.644 --> 30:42.012
They worked out the kinks
in the second version.

30:42.046 --> 30:43.347
Called it Venom.

30:46.150 --> 30:50.053
By then, Stan had acquired some clarity.

30:51.155 --> 30:55.058
He appealed to his
bosses to end the program.

30:55.093 --> 30:58.161
They refused, so he went over their heads

30:58.196 --> 31:00.197
to Thomas and Martha Wayne.

31:01.466 --> 31:04.067
He convinced them to shut it down.

31:04.102 --> 31:05.602
And when they died,

31:05.637 --> 31:07.838
WellZyn immediately revived the program

31:07.872 --> 31:10.173
with the blessings of Wayne Enterprises.

31:10.208 --> 31:11.542
In the end, there was nothing

31:11.576 --> 31:15.312
for Stan to do but to resort
to more radical measures.

31:15.346 --> 31:16.647
Killing people.

31:16.681 --> 31:19.383
I'm not hearing a sense of
moral outrage, Professor.

31:19.417 --> 31:22.286
If you don't mind, I'll
reserve my moral outrage

31:22.320 --> 31:24.488
for the true villains of this piece.

31:24.522 --> 31:26.089
You mean WellZyn.

31:26.124 --> 31:29.393
You planned this with Potolsky.

31:29.427 --> 31:31.295
- Yes.
- Where is he?

31:31.329 --> 31:32.796
Talk fast, bub!

31:32.830 --> 31:35.432
Oh, what are you gonna do to
me? I'm an old man! I'm dying.

31:35.466 --> 31:37.834
I'll help you die quicker, you terrorist.

31:37.869 --> 31:39.069
Soon, Stan will issue a statement

31:39.103 --> 31:40.571
the world won't be able to ignore.

31:40.605 --> 31:41.905
Soon?

31:41.940 --> 31:43.807
- Today?
- You're already too late.

31:43.842 --> 31:45.309
- Now, you tell us where he is right now.
- Wait a minute!

31:45.343 --> 31:47.144
Wait a minute! You said you
had an appointment, right?

31:47.178 --> 31:48.145
Where were you going?

31:48.179 --> 31:51.281
Bravo! You've asked the right question.

31:51.316 --> 31:54.184
The first step to enlightenment.

32:03.294 --> 32:05.262
No!

32:15.640 --> 32:16.673
Where is he?!

32:16.708 --> 32:18.542
- Where's Potolsky?!
- Those hypocrites.

32:18.576 --> 32:21.278
Empty altruism will not
erase what they've done.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.547
They must pay.

32:23.581 --> 32:25.849
- Who? Who must pay?
- WellZyn.

32:25.884 --> 32:27.484
Wayne Enterprises.

32:27.519 --> 32:30.020
Everyone will finally

32:30.054 --> 32:32.222
- see them for what they are.
- How?

32:32.257 --> 32:33.390
Where's Potolsky headed?

32:35.026 --> 32:37.027
What's altruism?!

32:39.063 --> 32:40.497
Charity.

32:42.467 --> 32:45.469
I know where he's going.

32:48.506 --> 32:51.208
- Name, please?
- He's, uh, Bruce Wayne.

32:51.242 --> 32:52.342
He's Bruce Wayne.

32:52.377 --> 32:54.645
- Just this way.
- Thank you. Thank you.

33:31.642 --> 33:32.976
Enterprises is

33:33.010 --> 33:34.611
a helping hand...

33:36.614 --> 33:38.748
Oh, that's Miss Mathis.

33:38.783 --> 33:40.717
She worked closely with your father.

33:40.751 --> 33:43.753
Wayne Enterprises is a shelter for all.

33:43.788 --> 33:45.789
And clean water...

34:03.874 --> 34:05.775
The smile of a child...

34:05.810 --> 34:08.678
Please, sit, Bruce.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.246
It is so good to see you out and about.

34:11.282 --> 34:13.683
Glad to be here.

34:13.717 --> 34:17.120
All of us at Wayne Enterprises
are so sorry for your loss.

34:18.856 --> 34:21.024
So, are all you here on the board?

34:21.058 --> 34:24.928
Oh, heavens no. We're middle management.

34:24.962 --> 34:27.530
The board members don't
do this sort of thing.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.165
No?

34:29.199 --> 34:30.500
Why not?

34:30.534 --> 34:35.772
Well, they're very busy people, Bruce.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.674
Your family created a company

34:37.708 --> 34:40.976
worth billions and billions of dollars.

34:41.011 --> 34:43.880
- How awesome is that?
- Awesome.

34:43.914 --> 34:46.116
I wanted to speak to
them because I've found

34:46.150 --> 34:47.516
what looks like serious irregularities

34:47.551 --> 34:48.717
in the Arkham project.

34:48.753 --> 34:51.187
Irregularities?

35:00.089 --> 35:04.034
I can assure you, Bruce,
that Wayne Enterprises

35:04.068 --> 35:06.870
would never countenance
doing business with criminals.

35:06.904 --> 35:08.671
- Just wouldn't happen.
- I hope so,

35:08.706 --> 35:11.975
but I'd like to speak
directly with the board myself.

35:12.009 --> 35:14.077
Can you make that happen?

35:14.111 --> 35:17.080
I can certainly try.

35:19.683 --> 35:22.052
They prefer to communicate with minors

35:22.086 --> 35:24.654
via the usual legal mediation, but...

35:24.689 --> 35:26.022
Good evening, ladies and gentleman.

35:26.057 --> 35:27.490
This is a public service announcement

35:27.525 --> 35:29.993
on behalf of all living creatures.

35:30.027 --> 35:32.929
You've heard of a drug called Viper?

35:34.765 --> 35:37.233
That's me.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.869
I made it for WellZyn,

35:39.904 --> 35:43.106
a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.575
- Is this true?
- Of course not, Bruce.

35:45.609 --> 35:47.944
I mean, this man is clearly insane.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.822
The AC plant... where is it? On the roof?

35:58.856 --> 36:00.690
Straight ahead, staircase
across the ballroom.

36:00.725 --> 36:02.025
Clear the ballroom!

36:02.059 --> 36:03.960
I hoped that a demonstration

36:03.994 --> 36:07.230
using street people would
suffice, but seems bad things

36:07.264 --> 36:12.302
only truly happen when they
happen to important people.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.604
Like you!

36:19.810 --> 36:21.611
GCPD! Everybody out!

36:21.645 --> 36:23.079
Now!

36:25.149 --> 36:27.283
Turn it off!

36:28.319 --> 36:30.320
Can't do that.

36:30.354 --> 36:32.789
Turn it off or I'll shoot!

36:32.823 --> 36:34.557
Go ahead.

36:34.592 --> 36:36.059
My work is done.

36:50.808 --> 36:52.642
Turn around! Put your
hands behind your head!

36:52.677 --> 36:54.344
Interlock your fingers!

36:54.378 --> 36:55.779
That's all right.

36:55.813 --> 36:58.648
You're angry and confused.

36:58.683 --> 37:00.150
I understand.

37:01.952 --> 37:03.787
There's no more need for violence.

37:03.821 --> 37:06.323
Don't shoot!

37:06.357 --> 37:08.258
That's considerate of you.

37:10.661 --> 37:13.897
I'm leaving now.

37:13.931 --> 37:16.433
Go look in warehouse 39.

37:16.467 --> 37:17.767
You're not going anywhere!

37:17.802 --> 37:20.370
I can go anywhere I want!

37:23.708 --> 37:24.541
Don't do it!

37:32.717 --> 37:35.552
You really can have too
much of a good thing.

38:14.639 --> 38:17.707
Nothing.

38:17.742 --> 38:21.444
What'd you expect? It's Gotham.

38:31.246 --> 38:33.247
It's Mathis.

38:33.282 --> 38:35.983
I'm outside the site. They're here.

38:36.018 --> 38:38.219
No. I think we should leave them be.

38:38.253 --> 38:41.422
There's nothing here for them.

38:41.457 --> 38:44.459
We'll review that if they get close.

39:30.973 --> 39:32.373
It's been ten minutes.

39:32.408 --> 39:35.176
I-I assure you, my friend is reliable.

39:37.179 --> 39:38.679
You scared, Penguin?

39:39.915 --> 39:41.516
Your voice is doing that shaky thing.

39:41.550 --> 39:43.484
No, sir.

39:43.519 --> 39:45.353
I'm fine.

39:45.387 --> 39:46.988
You don't have to act tough.

39:47.022 --> 39:48.322
Nerves are a good thing.

39:48.357 --> 39:51.559
Perhaps I am a bit jittery, sir.

39:51.593 --> 39:53.161
Good.

39:53.195 --> 39:54.462
You should be.

39:55.764 --> 39:58.499
'Cause if my boys don't
make it, neither do you.

40:05.374 --> 40:06.941
Got 'em!

40:06.975 --> 40:07.975
Keep going!

40:09.111 --> 40:10.912
Ha!

40:10.946 --> 40:12.914
Take that, Falcone, you son of a bitch!

40:12.948 --> 40:16.184
Huh? I told you, Frankie,
the kid's a player.

40:16.218 --> 40:18.086
He's got a future.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.189
What are you waiting
here like an old lady? Go!

40:30.065 --> 40:32.066
Untie me.

40:34.236 --> 40:36.237
Say "pretty please."

40:38.240 --> 40:41.542
Please.

40:41.577 --> 40:43.678
Ah!

40:46.482 --> 40:51.319
Sometimes I think you really don't like me.

40:51.353 --> 40:53.721
Now, would I be backing your takeover

40:53.756 --> 40:55.723
if I didn't like you?

40:55.758 --> 40:58.226
And that stuff with Falcone...
well, we have to look good

40:58.260 --> 40:59.394
for the old man.

40:59.428 --> 41:01.863
If he figures we're working together,

41:01.897 --> 41:05.299
we'd be cooked.

41:05.334 --> 41:08.569
- Patience.
- I have no more patience.

41:09.772 --> 41:11.773
The old man has to go.

41:11.807 --> 41:13.574
We must strike soon.

41:15.611 --> 41:19.380
Yes. Mm. But softly.

42:04.860 --> 42:06.361
Excuse me.

42:07.863 --> 42:10.999
I couldn't help but overhear
that aria you were humming.

42:11.033 --> 42:13.201
Oh, yes. It's my favorite.

42:13.235 --> 42:14.502
Mine, too.

42:14.536 --> 42:18.139
Ah, well, there you go.

42:18.173 --> 42:20.575
I'm sorry, I-I just...

42:20.609 --> 42:23.578
I-I didn't mean to bother you.

42:23.612 --> 42:26.247
My mother sang that to me when I was young.

42:26.282 --> 42:28.216
Her whole life, she sang that to me.

42:28.250 --> 42:30.718
I hadn't heard it in a while, and I...

42:30.753 --> 42:33.488
I had to smile because you look...

42:36.292 --> 42:39.227
Anyhow, sorry, I'm rambling on.

42:39.261 --> 42:41.796
No, that's okay.

42:41.830 --> 42:43.331
Do you want to listen?

42:45.034 --> 42:46.434
Well, yeah.

42:46.468 --> 42:48.069
S-Sure, thank you.

42:48.103 --> 42:50.104
Let's sit down.

43:05.521 --> 43:07.422
Hmm.
