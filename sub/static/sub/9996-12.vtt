<i>Previously on Medium:
Good God Almighty.</i>

00:04.030 --> 00:05.250
He's got it all here.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.699
When school starts, when school gets out,

00:07.700 --> 00:09.750
clubs they go to, friends' houses.

00:10.140 --> 00:13.500
I want a detail on that house 24 hours a day until we find this lunatic.

00:13.503 --> 00:14.849
This is Allison Dubois.

00:14.850 --> 00:16.900
And this is Lucas Harvey.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.200
What do you want?

00:18.740 --> 00:22.990
God has a plan, and there's no room in it for prophets.

00:23.150 --> 00:24.500
For seers.

00:24.503 --> 00:28.450
You and the Almighty will be discussing it face to face.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.650
It's holy water.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.300
To cleanse you with.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.600
You okay?

00:44.950 --> 00:45.800
You hurt?

00:46.820 --> 00:47.900
Look, Joe,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.600
I'm contemplating a stock purchase.

00:50.601 --> 00:51.300
I...

00:51.800 --> 00:53.900
need some advice on which way to jump.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.200
Markets and finances--

00:55.201 --> 00:56.900
that's really not something that I know a lot about.

00:56.901 --> 00:58.949
From your wife, Joe.

00:58.950 --> 01:00.940
This is an article about them.

01:00.941 --> 01:03.504
I can't read it because there's a doll-shaped hole cut in it.

01:03.505 --> 01:04.300
Yeah.

01:04.450 --> 01:06.700
You got to tell your boss to buy that stock.

01:06.701 --> 01:08.550
It's gonna go up today, way up.

01:08.650 --> 01:11.700
Did you happen to check the market when it closed this evening?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.450
I guess they were up...

01:14.950 --> 01:16.600
a little bit before lunch.

01:18.350 --> 01:20.450
And then they just fell off the face of the earth.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.990
I got to start laying people off.

01:24.730 --> 01:25.600
You okay?

01:27.550 --> 01:29.400
Sir, do you think some water would help?

01:32.950 --> 01:34.500
I think this guy's a dentist.

01:34.650 --> 01:36.650
The one who keeps gassing these girls.

01:36.750 --> 01:39.900
This looks like a picture of the woman that I dreamt about.

01:39.903 --> 01:41.400
But she looks dead.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.800
That's because she is dead.

01:43.005 --> 01:44.900
That's not possible. I saw it.

01:44.901 --> 01:45.990
You saw wrong.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.950
Hello, Allison.

01:50.380 --> 01:51.806
Dreams don't just happen.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.600
They have to come from somewhere.

01:53.750 --> 01:55.102
And for the last little while,

01:55.103 --> 01:57.200
your dreams have been coming from me.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.900
Sweet dreams...

01:59.630 --> 02:00.200
bitch!

02:54.450 --> 02:55.200
Joe?

03:06.000 --> 03:06.700
Hey.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.000
Whatcha doing?

03:13.470 --> 03:15.030
Oh, I don't know.

03:17.100 --> 03:20.100
Thinking about taking up smoking again, actually.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.600
Well, don't do that.

03:21.900 --> 03:24.200
All right, if you say so.

03:26.650 --> 03:28.600
I am so, so sorry.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.300
I don't know how to do it.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.300
I don't know how to fire these people.

03:39.750 --> 03:40.800
I kept lying in bed,

03:40.801 --> 03:43.000
and I just go over and over it in my head,

03:43.001 --> 03:43.900
and I just...

03:45.550 --> 03:47.800
can't figure out how to do it.

03:48.470 --> 03:50.250
I know what happened now.

03:51.700 --> 03:55.600
Why I dreamt that dream about the stocks and how it all went so wrong.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.800
It was Lucas Harvey.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.200
What was Lucas Harvey?

04:04.750 --> 04:06.401
He's taken control of my dreams.

04:06.402 --> 04:07.808
He's changing them.

04:08.140 --> 04:10.700
He's making sure that all of them are untrue.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.070
It's his way of making me irrelevant.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.903
He thinks that he, uh,

04:15.904 --> 04:19.899
is restoring some kind of balance between good and evil in the world.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.650
He's on some kind of...

04:23.150 --> 04:24.860
mission from God.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.500
You're not saying anything.

04:36.760 --> 04:37.850
I don't care.

04:39.150 --> 04:40.100
He's dead.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.800
The people I have to fire tomorrow...

04:44.900 --> 04:46.200
they're still alive.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.200
You coming in?

05:05.500 --> 05:06.850
Maybe in a while.

05:13.700 --> 05:14.950
<i>Girls...</i>

05:15.050 --> 05:17.990
I asked you not to cut up my paper anymore.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.999
It wasn't me.

05:20.000 --> 05:20.999
It was Marie.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.900
She loves cutting dolls out of the stock market listings.

05:23.901 --> 05:24.400
Marie, honey,

05:24.401 --> 05:28.100
I told you that you can't cut up Daddy's paper to make your dolls anymore.

05:28.102 --> 05:29.900
This is Maye and this is Wilt.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.300
Wilt? What kind name is that?

05:32.301 --> 05:34.800
That's a girl doll, and you can't call it Wilt.

05:34.801 --> 05:37.100
Honey, she can call it whatever she wants.

05:37.101 --> 05:38.238
But she just... Hey.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.500
You can't cut up Daddy's paper anymore.

05:40.501 --> 05:42.950
You know what? Daddy doesn't care anymore.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.839
Daddy has to get into work early

05:45.840 --> 05:48.150
so he can be the first one there this morning.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.990
Why? Is something going on?

05:50.750 --> 05:54.249
Daddy's just got to give a lot of people some really bad news.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.900
Enjoy your dolls, kiddo.

05:58.950 --> 06:00.450
You're only young once.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.100
Maye's buying Wilt's house today.

06:03.441 --> 06:04.300
What's that?

06:04.301 --> 06:06.100
Maye's buying Wilt's house.

06:07.406 --> 06:08.606
Yeah, that's great, you know?

06:08.607 --> 06:11.200
But if Maye had actually bothered to read the paper that she's made from,

06:11.201 --> 06:16.100
she'd know that it's not a very good time to buy a house.

06:17.150 --> 06:18.100
Bye, Dad.

06:18.101 --> 06:19.200
Bye, Dad. Bye, Dad.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.400
you are broken

06:31.500 --> 06:32.899
Allison, I'm glad you're here.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.749
I just got off the phone with Detective Scanlon.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.700
He was wondering if we could meet him in the morgue.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.900
Allison, you okay?

06:44.400 --> 06:46.099
Hmm? I'm fine.

06:46.100 --> 06:46.900
Of course.

06:50.390 --> 06:51.199
ispected by #8

06:51.200 --> 06:54.130
They found this deep in the nasal cavity of Trisha Daniels.

06:54.131 --> 06:57.550
Clearly,omeone took the time to roll it up, insert it.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.650
I'm guessing he used a set of tweezers.

06:59.930 --> 07:01.040
Anyway, I had them go back

07:01.041 --> 07:05.200
and take another look at the body of the first victim, Carrie Denton.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.700
And?

07:06.800 --> 07:09.450
Well, same kind of tag-- left nasal cavity.

07:09.451 --> 07:12.307
What are you telling me, our killer likes to mark his victims,

07:12.308 --> 07:14.849
likes to leave a kind of signature?

07:14.850 --> 07:16.300
This guy takes pride in his work.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.449
Just to be sure, I called the coroner in Scottsdale.

07:18.450 --> 07:21.099
He took another look at the body of Cassidy Pierson. Mom?

07:21.100 --> 07:22.740
Same thing, same place.

07:25.900 --> 07:26.804
Okay, well, I suppose that's progress.

07:26.805 --> 07:29.050
- Mommy?
- Well, it gets better.

07:29.200 --> 07:33.806
They managed to lift a partial fingerprint off the tag they pulled out of Trisha Daniels.

07:33.807 --> 07:35.837
We're running it now. Do you have a sense...

07:35.838 --> 07:36.900
Mommy?

07:51.600 --> 07:52.405
Please...

07:53.950 --> 07:54.900
What's going on?

08:00.200 --> 08:01.000
Well, that...

08:02.050 --> 08:03.450
well, that depends.

08:04.405 --> 08:05.750
What do you see?

08:07.540 --> 08:08.300
What do you mean?

08:09.645 --> 08:11.500
I mean the body on the slab.

08:12.650 --> 08:14.800
Do you... do you recognize it?

08:15.800 --> 08:18.602
Um, that's, uh, Trisha Daniels.

08:18.603 --> 08:20.750
That's the third victim.

08:21.800 --> 08:22.600
Why?

08:25.600 --> 08:26.900
Is that what you see?

08:27.650 --> 08:28.950
There's nothing else there.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.700
Allison, what's going on?

08:33.350 --> 08:34.039
Nothing.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.450
Ah, it's a joke.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.030
A person-- not even a person--is trying to make a hideous joke.

08:42.650 --> 08:44.990
Well, I would wish him dead, but...

08:45.092 --> 08:47.300
that would be beside the point.

08:53.850 --> 08:54.900
Mr. Dubois?

08:56.100 --> 08:57.201
Hi, Rachel.

08:57.350 --> 08:58.800
I just wanted to give you this.

08:59.055 --> 09:00.950
It has mlatest contact info.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.549
I just thought... should things change,

09:03.550 --> 09:05.400
I would love to come back.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.900
Oh, really?

09:07.500 --> 09:10.099
Well, I thought you'd all go head out to a bar someplace

09:10.100 --> 09:11.600
and burn me in effigy.

09:12.100 --> 09:15.499
No. Hey, y were a great boss.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.900
And... we read the papers.

09:18.050 --> 09:21.200
Actually, a lot of us already have temp work lined up at WILT.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.149
WILT?

09:23.150 --> 09:26.800
Yeah, Worldwide Integrated Logistics and Technologies.

09:26.801 --> 09:29.300
They just set up camp at Plaza Industrial Park.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.149
I don't think I'm familiar with them.

09:31.150 --> 09:32.200
It's a new start-up.

09:32.201 --> 09:35.449
But the good news is in this economy they still need people.

09:35.450 --> 09:36.950
Their business is going great.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.104
Actually, I heard a rumor

09:38.105 --> 09:40.200
that Maye Consolidated might buy them up.

09:42.403 --> 09:43.200
No kidding.

09:44.050 --> 09:47.200
Maye might buy Wilt's house, huh?

09:47.404 --> 09:48.200
I'm sorry?

09:49.450 --> 09:51.010
No, no, nothing.

09:54.104 --> 09:59.200
It's funny how your throat always gets scratchy just when it's time for gym class.

10:00.450 --> 10:01.600
I don't see a thing.

10:01.900 --> 10:02.990
You sit tight.

10:03.250 --> 10:04.300
I'll be right back.

10:08.850 --> 10:11.800
Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.

10:14.150 --> 10:15.670
That's from Proverbs.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.900
You ever read Proverbs?

10:23.150 --> 10:24.900
You ever heard about hell?

10:28.700 --> 10:30.200
'Cause that's where you're going.

10:34.750 --> 10:35.900
Tell your mother

10:36.200 --> 10:41.304
Lucas Harvey told you he's going to slit your throat

10:41.900 --> 10:46.450
and send your little lying ass straight to hell.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.599
I'm fine. I'm fine.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.300
I'M GOING TO...

10:57.900 --> 10:58.700
No!

11:00.900 --> 11:02.050
Bridge, what is it?

11:02.100 --> 11:04.100
Can't we just sleep with the lights on tonight?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.350
What? Why?

11:06.200 --> 11:08.600
I don't like to sleep with the lights on.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.700
I like to sleep with the lights off.

11:12.050 --> 11:12.700
Hey.

11:18.850 --> 11:22.900
Bridge, honey, you haven't been afraid of the dark for a long time.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.900
Can't I just sleep with you and Dad?

11:26.750 --> 11:27.400
Hey.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.100
Lucas Harvey visited Bridgette in school today.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.500
What do you mean he visited?

11:36.150 --> 11:37.800
He's a ghost. She can see him.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.204
She was afraid to tell me.

11:39.205 --> 11:41.050
She was afraid she was going to frighten me.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.302
Wait a second.

11:42.303 --> 11:43.900
Is there anything to be frightened about?

11:44.500 --> 11:49.200
I mean, I don't like the idea of this dead nut-job following my kids around.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.500
Well, honey, there's nothing you can do to stop him.

11:52.150 --> 11:53.599
I mean, I just explained it to her.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.599
He's only a ghost.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.573
He can't actually touch you.

11:55.574 --> 11:57.400
He can't actually do anything to you.

11:57.770 --> 12:00.557
Except maybe scare you or bother you.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.450
And even that, only if you let him.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.100
And that worked?

12:05.300 --> 12:08.200
Well, that and allowing her to keep her bathroom light on.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.500
He tried the same thing with me today,

12:10.501 --> 12:11.550
and afterwards I realized

12:11.551 --> 12:14.500
the key to making him leave us alone is to ignore him.

12:14.730 --> 12:17.800
Deny him the satisfaction of having any impact on us.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.150
That's the theory anyway.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.900
Let's see if it works.

12:24.550 --> 12:27.430
Hey,hat are you doing out here 11:00 at night on the computer?

12:27.431 --> 12:29.200
Well, it's the darnedest thing.

12:29.201 --> 12:31.100
I came out here to see if any of the engineering blogs

12:31.101 --> 12:34.005
have gotten wind of the layoffs that I made today,

12:34.006 --> 12:36.150
and I came across this headline.

12:37.300 --> 12:40.400
"Maye Consolidated Makes Formal Offer for WILT."

12:40.406 --> 12:43.400
Maye bought WILT's house.

12:43.701 --> 12:46.500
Remember, Marie this morning, with her paper dolls?

12:46.950 --> 12:48.770
I think I've been listing to the wrong psychic.

12:49.500 --> 12:53.400
I don't think it's just a coincidence that Marie always cuts those dolls out of the stock market listings.

12:53.401 --> 12:56.104
I think that the names that she gives those dolls have meaning as well.

12:56.105 --> 12:57.144
I mean, "Maye" and "WILT"--

12:57.145 --> 12:59.799
those are four-letter symbols for companies on the Exchange.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.199
Why are you looking at me like that?

13:01.200 --> 13:03.100
I'm just dying to see where you're going with this.

13:03.102 --> 13:04.800
Where I'm going with this is simple.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.800
This morning, Marie looked at the two of us,

13:08.300 --> 13:11.200
and she said "Maye is going to buy Wilt's house today."

13:11.350 --> 13:13.600
And Allison, that is exactly what happened.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.050
Sometime after the stock market closed tonight,

13:16.300 --> 13:18.300
Maye Consolidated bought WILT.

13:18.301 --> 13:21.247
- They did. Maye bought WILT's house.
- And your point is?

13:21.248 --> 13:24.700
My point is I think maybe our little girl is able to pick winning stocks.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.108
You're joking, right?

13:26.109 --> 13:27.100
No, I'm not joking.

13:27.101 --> 13:28.119
Joe, she's five years old.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.900
She doesn't even know what a stock is.

13:29.901 --> 13:32.400
Be that as it may: Maye bought WILT's house.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.950
May is a month, okay?

13:35.951 --> 13:38.164
Wilt is... a basketball player.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.144
I'm just saying, look,

13:39.145 --> 13:41.600
is if our little girl happens to disobey me tomorrow

13:41.601 --> 13:44.551
and just happens to cut a couple of dolls out of the paper,

13:44.552 --> 13:46.900
let's not be so quick to throw them away.

13:47.470 --> 13:50.845
That is an insane amount of pressure to put on a five-year-old.

13:50.846 --> 13:52.499
I'm not going to put any pressure on her.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.000
She's not going to feel any pressure.

13:54.001 --> 13:57.100
That is an insane amount of pressure to put on anyone.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.400
Oh, is that what you think?

13:58.401 --> 14:00.149
You think this is about the stock tip that you gave me?

14:00.150 --> 14:01.300
Yeah, I do.

14:01.900 --> 14:02.450
And you know what?

14:02.451 --> 14:04.800
I think what's happening to you is horrible.

14:04.801 --> 14:06.400
I feel terrible about it.

14:06.401 --> 14:07.856
I really wouldn't want that for Marie.

14:07.857 --> 14:09.050
Well, it's not going to happen.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.299
Yeah, well, I hope not.

14:10.300 --> 14:11.900
Well, don't lose any sleep over it.

14:11.901 --> 14:13.149
Okay, if you say so.

14:13.150 --> 14:14.820
I say so. Good night.

14:15.450 --> 14:16.550
Good night.

14:18.220 --> 14:20.900
I don't know what kind of cable box I have.

14:23.100 --> 14:23.850
Black.

14:24.350 --> 14:27.800
It's black with a silver plate thing on the front.

14:27.801 --> 14:29.730
Look, can I just give yo my account number?

14:31.700 --> 14:32.990
Sure, I'll hold.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.900
Hello. Yes, I have been on hold.

14:55.050 --> 14:57.205
Oh, I would love it if you sent someone.

14:59.020 --> 15:01.800
Thursday would be fine between 10:00 and 2:00.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.400
Yes, it's 3431 Maple Ridge Drive.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.400
3431 Maple Ridge Drive.

15:10.350 --> 15:12.200
Oh, no. Thank you.

15:19.700 --> 15:25.200
3431 Maple Ridge Drive.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.050
This is Scanlon.

15:53.350 --> 15:54.600
Hold on a second.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.200
Sorry. I just didn't want to wake Lynn up.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.100
at's up?

16:06.800 --> 16:08.150
I think I saw him.

16:08.650 --> 16:09.400
Saw who?

16:09.450 --> 16:11.300
You know who I'm talking about.

16:11.764 --> 16:13.300
I got a good look at his face.

16:13.562 --> 16:17.230
He's got that gas that he uses to knock the girls out in his refrigerator.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.009
- Allison...
- I even got an address. Do you want it?

16:20.400 --> 16:21.902
I don't know. I mean, no offense, Allison,

16:21.903 --> 16:23.201
but after what happened the other day...

16:23.202 --> 16:24.850
Look, no, I know, I get it.

16:25.015 --> 16:25.750
I  DO.

16:26.050 --> 16:28.600
I-I almost didn't even call you.

16:29.053 --> 16:31.300
And I don't know if this address is any good.

16:32.030 --> 16:34.406
But we have nothing. We have no leads.

16:34.407 --> 16:35.660
We have no clues.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.200
How do I not call you?

16:38.266 --> 16:40.200
When you put it like that, how do I not look?

16:41.300 --> 16:42.500
What's his address?

16:52.195 --> 16:55.200
?.? MAIL

17:09.200 --> 17:10.400
Allison Dubois.

17:10.450 --> 17:13.305
Well, whatever problems you're having with you dreams,

17:13.306 --> 17:14.948
it looks like it's worked itself out.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.200
What are you talking about?

17:16.500 --> 17:18.500
I'm at 3431 Maple Ridge.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.150
The house belongs to a Kevin Flynn.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.999
Fridge is full of isoflurane valve inhalers.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.450
Bureau drawer is full of pictures of dead women whose faces are beaten to a pulp.

17:27.451 --> 17:28.650
Oh, my goodness.

17:28.800 --> 17:29.400
Is he there?

17:29.401 --> 17:30.760
Was he there when you showed up?

17:30.850 --> 17:32.200
Oh, yeah, he's here.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.905
In fact, his brains are splattered

17:34.906 --> 17:36.306
all over the living room wall.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.600
LOOKS LIKE HE KILLED HIMSELF EARLY THIS MORNING.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.300
MAYE SNAPS UP WILT

17:47.600 --> 17:48.800
Getting into the market?

17:49.550 --> 17:52.550
My husband, Joe-- he keeps wanting to invest.

17:52.901 --> 17:53.990
It frightens me.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.750
Care to see the fruits of your dreams?

18:00.250 --> 18:02.303
Turns out the guy was a pharmaceutical sales rep,

18:02.304 --> 18:04.600
which is how I'm assuming he got his hands on these.

18:04.601 --> 18:07.200
We pulled about a dozen of them out of his refrigerator.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.498
He used these to incapacitate his victims.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.437
Then he pummeled them to death wearing those gloves.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.800
There's steel in the knuckles.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.450
Then he posed them, and then he took their photographs.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.503
He lived in Phoenix,

18:17.504 --> 18:19.549
but he traveled to Scottsdale on business,

18:19.550 --> 18:22.050
which helps explain why there were victims in both cities.

18:22.051 --> 18:24.300
And, you know, just in case there was any doubt,

18:25.200 --> 18:27.959
Flynn had a Ziploc full of these.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.500
"Inspected by #8."

18:30.501 --> 18:31.900
I guess he thought that was funny.

18:32.540 --> 18:35.700
You'll recall we found a partial fingerprint on one of those tags.

18:35.960 --> 18:39.300
Forensics just matched it to Kevin Flynn's right index finger.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.800
It's a shame I'm not going to get to prosecute him.

18:42.801 --> 18:44.500
This would have been an open-and-shut case.

18:44.501 --> 18:47.200
You know what I can't figure out is why he killed himself.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.019
He had no way of knowing I was going to dream about him,

18:50.600 --> 18:53.880
no way of knowing that I would be able to tell you exactly where he lived.

18:54.730 --> 18:56.650
I don't really care why this pervert killed himself.

18:56.653 --> 18:57.800
I'm just glad he did.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.800
Can you keep an eye on all this for a minute till I can send an officer in to gather all this up?

19:02.801 --> 19:03.149
Sure.

19:03.150 --> 19:05.500
Hey, you're back, Allison Dubois.

19:05.900 --> 19:06.550
Nice work.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.200
I second that. Thank you.

19:08.350 --> 19:09.608
But I didn't do anything.

19:09.609 --> 19:12.700
I just went sleep, and it just... came to me.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.700
Well, nonetheless.

19:18.170 --> 19:19.500
You're still broken.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.900
"I didn't do anything.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.019
I went to sleep, and it just came to me."

19:27.500 --> 19:31.600
What came to you is what I chose to bring to you.

19:31.950 --> 19:33.750
You're broken, Allison Dubois.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.900
And soon everyone will know it.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.100
And no one will listen.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.990
And all will be as it's meant to be.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.200
Okay. Whatever you say.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.500
We found him and he's dead.

19:47.033 --> 19:47.780
I had a dream.

19:47.782 --> 19:51.100
I saw his address, and now it's over.

19:53.550 --> 19:54.355
Maybe.

19:56.950 --> 19:58.299
Mind if I just grab this stuff

19:58.300 --> 19:59.900
and bring it down to the evidence locker?

20:01.740 --> 20:02.450
Ma'am?

20:03.840 --> 20:04.600
Sure.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.400
It's like a death.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.200
For you.

20:30.160 --> 20:30.964
What's this?

20:30.965 --> 20:32.600
That's a stock. It's a company.

20:32.950 --> 20:34.700
They manufacture containers.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.999
Huge ones-- the kind you find in ports all over the world.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.500
Except that these containers have special sensors inside them

20:40.502 --> 20:42.994
that monitor their own contents.

20:42.995 --> 20:44.747
And they let you know immediately from the outside

20:44.750 --> 20:47.099
whether or not ty contain any nuclear material,

20:47.100 --> 20:51.900
like the kind you find in a suitcase bomb or a small terrorist weapon.

20:53.158 --> 20:54.499
Why are you showing me this?

20:54.500 --> 20:55.929
Well, I want you to buy it.

20:55.930 --> 20:58.499
Buy the stock, buy the company, whatever you can.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.911
It's going to make you a fortune.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.100
Or at least it's going to put you back where you were,

21:02.101 --> 21:04.300
which means, hopefully, you'll put me back where I was

21:04.301 --> 21:06.600
and let me hire back my people and finish my work.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.800
Where'd you get this?

21:10.200 --> 21:12.100
Did you get this from your wife? No.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.500
Then where'd you get it? Does that matter?

21:14.501 --> 21:15.700
Does it matter?

21:16.850 --> 21:21.099
I bet damn near everything I own on a stock your wife guaranteed.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.913
No, no, no. You pickedhat stock.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.348
You asked for her opinion.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.550
She did the best she could.

21:25.551 --> 21:26.900
I'm picking this one.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.200
Pretty cocky for a guy who's done nothing but cost me money.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.001
You're pretty arrogant for a person

21:35.002 --> 21:36.990
who's done nothing but spend money foolishly.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.700
I still own you, Joe.

21:40.701 --> 21:42.509
Okay, well, let me put you out of your misery.

21:42.750 --> 21:45.900
I want to buy back my company and my idea from you.

21:46.700 --> 21:47.800
I beg your pardon?

21:47.851 --> 21:48.880
You heard me.

21:48.881 --> 21:50.306
If you don't want to buy this stock, I will,

21:50.307 --> 21:52.990
and I'll use the money that I make to buy you out.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.200
Are you insane?

21:58.144 --> 22:00.100
You're not a corporate raider.

22:00.900 --> 22:03.300
Even if that stock does go through the roof,

22:04.163 --> 22:05.800
where are you going to get the money to buy it?

22:06.550 --> 22:08.900
You'd have to invest every penny you own.

22:09.150 --> 22:10.950
If that's what it takes, that's what it takes.

22:13.870 --> 22:16.300
I'm going to do you a huge favor, son.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.700
Save your money.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.500
The business is not for sale.

22:21.501 --> 22:23.600
Your idea is not for sale.

22:23.601 --> 22:25.450
<i>You are not for sale.</i>

22:26.300 --> 22:27.400
I mean it, Terry.

22:27.401 --> 22:28.844
I want to buy the business back.

22:28.845 --> 22:30.100
Just give me a couple days.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.500
You'll make money off this.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.200
Not for sale.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.609
You weren't serious, were you?

22:39.610 --> 22:41.070
I couldn't be more serious.

22:41.071 --> 22:43.199
Wait. I-I'm confused.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.543
Even if Terry was willing to sell you the business,

22:45.544 --> 22:47.990
what money is it you were planning on pooling together?

22:48.050 --> 22:50.010
Money. Our money. Our savings.

22:50.012 --> 22:51.340
Our retirement account.

22:52.166 --> 22:54.168
You know, I'd take out a second mortgage again on the house,

22:54.169 --> 22:55.500
if I had to. Money.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.250
Are you listening to yourself?

22:57.860 --> 22:59.705
You're talking about everything we have,

22:59.706 --> 23:01.109
and what we have is not much.

23:01.110 --> 23:03.700
I'm talking about information that's being supplied by our own daughter.

23:03.706 --> 23:04.800
She's five

23:04.801 --> 23:07.050
Yeah, and she has yet to be wrong about anything, Allison.

23:07.054 --> 23:08.768
I've done my research, you know? I checked with her.

23:08.769 --> 23:10.029
I've checked out every single stock,

23:10.030 --> 23:11.300
every single doll that she cut out of the paper,

23:11.301 --> 23:13.100
and theye all been huge winners.

23:13.450 --> 23:20.300
No! No! I am not having this conversation with a man who's maybe a year away from having a PhD,

23:20.301 --> 23:23.700
who's trying to convince me to listen to a girl's paper dolls.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.799
Oh, so now it's up to me to convince you

23:25.800 --> 23:28.604
that our youngest daughter might be sensitive to things that defy,

23:28.605 --> 23:30.450
uh, rational explanation?

23:30.720 --> 23:32.400
You don't have to convince me of anything.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.950
He's not going to let you buy that business, right?

23:37.300 --> 23:38.300
Right.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.500
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

23:55.507 --> 23:57.237
Come on, get inside. Hurry up.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.300
Someone is going to see you.

23:58.900 --> 23:59.900
Come on.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.850
You're not supposed to be here.

24:06.230 --> 24:07.740
That's not part of the arrangement.

24:08.300 --> 24:10.350
We're only supposed to talk online. You know that.

24:10.630 --> 24:11.800
You want to explain this?

24:13.600 --> 24:16.288
THE ARIZONA OBSERVER KILLER LEAVES FINGERPRINT

24:18.300 --> 24:20.900
Okay. I made a mistake.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.508
But actually, it's no big deal.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.550
My fingerprints aren't traceable.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.500
I'm not in any system. They can't track me to this.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.500
You think.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.250
Now we're going to have to be even more careful.

24:35.180 --> 24:38.600
I'm thinking we're going to have to slow down.

24:38.601 --> 24:40.400
No, no, no. That's crazy.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.889
Nothing has to change.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.400
Here, look.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.990
I was just about toend you these.

24:49.138 --> 24:50.200
They're brand-new.

24:52.750 --> 24:53.800
Don't you want to see them?

24:59.700 --> 25:00.800
Pretty nice, huh?

25:01.205 --> 25:02.554
I thought about you when I saw her.

25:02.555 --> 25:05.400
I mean, she looks like your type, don't you think?

25:05.650 --> 25:08.150
I mean, I know we're not supposed to have a type.

25:08.151 --> 25:10.700
We're supposed to be the same guy and all, but, um...

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I don't know.

25:12.300 --> 25:13.600
I saw her and I thought of you.

25:18.259 --> 25:19.450
Well, you're upset.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.550
There's no reason to be upset.

25:23.170 --> 25:24.800
We got the perfect setup here.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.399
I get to enjoy your work. You get to enjoy my work.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.300
The police still have no idea that there's two of us.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.406
Honestly, we don't have to stop.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.550
We don't even have to slow down. Not because of that.

25:41.230 --> 25:45.400
So, um, you didn't happen to bring anything for me, did you?

25:57.500 --> 26:00.450
Oh, nice. Nice.

26:00.900 --> 26:05.450
You've got some really... really nice ones here.

26:08.330 --> 26:10.150
Oh, my God, there's two of them.

26:13.700 --> 26:14.700
Hey, Allison.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.800
It's barely 7:00. What are you doing here?

26:16.801 --> 26:19.600
He had a partner. Kevin Flynn was working with a partner.

26:22.300 --> 26:23.804
What are you saying? It was a two-man operation?

26:23.805 --> 26:25.305
One-one would use the gas, and the other...

26:25.306 --> 26:27.603
No, no. It wasn't that kind of a partnership.

26:27.604 --> 26:29.900
It was more like a killers franchise.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.707
Flynn worked here in Phoenix.

26:31.708 --> 26:33.203
The other guy worked in Scottsdale.

26:33.204 --> 26:35.323
And they made sure to do everything exactly the same

26:35.324 --> 26:39.040
so that the police will think that there was only one killer.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.600
Why?

26:40.870 --> 26:42.099
I don't know. I...

26:42.100 --> 26:43.600
To throw us off the scent?

26:43.830 --> 26:46.399
I know they enjoyed looking at pictures of each other's work.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.400
The girls.

26:47.550 --> 26:49.100
I suppose that was part of it.

26:49.102 --> 26:51.500
Okay, what does this other guy look like?

26:52.700 --> 26:54.800
Well, actually, I'm not sure.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.860
Well, I don't understand. How did this come to you?

26:56.862 --> 26:57.863
You had a dream?

26:58.550 --> 26:59.550
Yes.

26:59.750 --> 27:00.760
And was he in it?

27:00.900 --> 27:02.500
Well, I wasn't allowed to see him,

27:02.501 --> 27:04.800
but that doesn't change the fact that he exists.

27:04.803 --> 27:08.504
All right. Since we c't prove that there really is a partner,

27:08.505 --> 27:11.099
or a collaborator, a fellow franchisee,

27:11.100 --> 27:14.399
and we're not sure what he looks like, if you don't mind,

27:14.400 --> 27:19.300
I'm just going to go on about my day as if he doesn't exist.

27:19.301 --> 27:22.200
Obviously, if you can come up with a description of this man,

27:22.201 --> 27:25.201
or some physical evidence that ties him in to at least one of the murders,

27:25.201 --> 27:26.200
all that changes.

27:26.201 --> 27:28.005
But I just...

27:29.160 --> 27:31.143
I can't do much with what you've given me.

27:31.144 --> 27:32.150
I'm sorry.

27:32.630 --> 27:33.900
I understand.

27:40.008 --> 27:42.350
Well, that's got to be discouraging.

27:42.940 --> 27:45.300
I mean, you had the dream,

27:45.301 --> 27:47.500
but you couldn't see the killer's face.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.150
What happens now?

27:50.950 --> 27:52.700
You can't solve the crime.

27:52.900 --> 27:55.200
Can't get anyone to listen to you.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.880
Well, you're not depressed, are you?

27:59.270 --> 28:01.200
Not suicidal?

28:02.750 --> 28:04.200
Maybe just a little bit?

28:05.741 --> 28:07.100
Are you enjoying this?

28:07.250 --> 28:10.449
Well, I take satisfaction in knowing that I'm enabling God's will.

28:10.450 --> 28:12.900
Yes. "For dreams have deceived many,

28:12.901 --> 28:15.100
and they have failed that put their trust in them."

28:15.150 --> 28:16.500
Ecclesiasticus.

28:17.003 --> 28:21.009
All you're doing is seeing to it that innocent people get killed.

28:21.010 --> 28:22.399
How can that be God's will?

28:22.400 --> 28:23.450
No, no, no.

28:23.800 --> 28:28.200
We're simply allowing people to perish who were meant to perish.

28:28.201 --> 28:29.200
"We"?

28:29.250 --> 28:30.800
The Lord and I.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.000
Yes.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.200
You know...

28:35.460 --> 28:37.700
you can put an end to all this, Allison.

28:37.701 --> 28:38.769
Right. I heard you.

28:38.770 --> 28:40.027
Yes. Kill myself.

28:40.100 --> 28:41.750
Well, no. That's not going to happen.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.650
Well, failing that, you could stop dreaming.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.549
Or, at the very least,

28:47.550 --> 28:50.100
stop paying so much attention to what you dream.

28:50.950 --> 28:52.600
That's what the others have done.

28:52.601 --> 28:53.600
"Others"?

28:53.601 --> 28:56.400
Well, it's not just you whose dreams I'm editing.

28:56.850 --> 29:00.017
Oh, there are many others, all over the world.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.800
Dreamers, meddlers, interlopers.

29:04.133 --> 29:09.700
People like you too ignorant to understand that their interference is unnatural,

29:10.400 --> 29:12.450
an abomination to the truth.

29:13.600 --> 29:16.750
But slowly, I'm teaching all of them to ignore their dreams,

29:18.200 --> 29:21.100
and teaching those around them to ignore the dreamers.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.600
Allison?

29:28.100 --> 29:29.100
You okay?

29:34.640 --> 29:35.900
Yeah. No.

29:36.820 --> 29:37.950
I'm fine.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.699
Hello, this is Allison Dubois.

29:42.700 --> 29:44.603
I can't get to the phone, but please leave a message,

29:44.604 --> 29:46.600
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

29:46.980 --> 29:48.050
Hey. It's me.

29:48.300 --> 29:50.306
Um, I justhought you might want to know that,

29:50.307 --> 29:52.299
uh, that stock that Marie found...

29:52.300 --> 29:55.200
The container company? It took off this morning.

29:55.450 --> 29:59.200
You know, if we'd invested even one tenth of our savings,

29:59.201 --> 30:00.199
we would have had enough money

30:00.200 --> 30:02.402
to put all three girls through whatever college they wanted.

30:02.403 --> 30:03.350
Twice.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.100
Is that petty of me to point that out? Sorry.

30:07.101 --> 30:09.400
I guess I'm feeling a little... petty.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.550
Call me back.

30:17.260 --> 30:18.450
That didn't take long.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.700
Excuse me?

30:20.000 --> 30:20.950
Terry?

30:22.400 --> 30:23.400
Joe!

30:24.270 --> 30:26.750
I just wanted to offer my congratulations.

30:27.930 --> 30:30.808
Maybe now you'd be willing to tell me who tipped you to that stock.

30:32.420 --> 30:33.420
That's all right.

30:34.450 --> 30:35.990
I deserve that.

30:36.370 --> 30:38.045
I was arrogant.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.990
Must feel good to be on the winning side of an equation.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.200
Yeah. Terry, um...

30:44.201 --> 30:45.700
Joe, let's be frank.

30:47.300 --> 30:50.500
It's still at least a couple of years before your division

30:50.501 --> 30:53.100
even has the possibility of turning a profit.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.430
It's the most speculative venture I am currently funding.

30:57.431 --> 31:00.000
Now, I don't believe for a minute

31:00.001 --> 31:04.049
that you could have possibly earned enough off that stock to buy me out,

31:04.050 --> 31:07.300
but it's also clear that you're a clever guy,

31:07.600 --> 31:08.799
not just as an engineer,

31:08.800 --> 31:12.200
but you seem to know your way around the markets as well.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.300
So, I'll tell you what.

31:17.500 --> 31:22.960
If you're still interested, I'll sell you back your company.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.099
I'm not going to let you completely off the hook.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.600
You're going to end up paying me a royalty,

31:27.601 --> 31:32.550
but if you can get together a couple million dollars,

31:32.551 --> 31:35.900
we can figure out how you can pay me the balance over time.

31:35.901 --> 31:37.200
That should work for you,

31:37.201 --> 31:41.000
and it'll give me the chance to get all that red ink

31:41.001 --> 31:44.200
your enterprise generates off my balance sheets.

31:45.630 --> 31:46.700
So, what do you say?

31:47.250 --> 31:48.700
A couple million dollars?

31:48.900 --> 31:52.199
No, no, no, no. I'm not going to negotiate over the phone.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.500
I'm just saying, if you still have a desire to do this thing,

31:55.502 --> 31:59.200
then, um, I have half a mind to help you.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.450
Joe? You still there?

32:02.700 --> 32:05.500
Yeah. That's-that's very generous of you, sir.

32:05.850 --> 32:10.100
You know, it may take me a little while to put together a couple million dollars.

32:11.240 --> 32:15.550
Don't do the modesty thing. I've already seen you in action.

32:16.650 --> 32:18.100
<i>Come on!</i>

32:18.200 --> 32:21.599
Trade me the Barbershop Bonnie for the Beach Bunny Bonnie!

32:21.600 --> 32:22.990
Please?

32:22.991 --> 32:23.900
No!

32:24.400 --> 32:25.556
You girls ready for bed?

32:25.557 --> 32:27.500
No... No.

32:28.350 --> 32:31.250
What you doing, hmm? Playing with dolls?

32:31.500 --> 32:33.700
Yeah, but Marie isn't playing nice.

32:33.701 --> 32:36.600
I wanted to trade, but she won't do it!

32:37.040 --> 32:38.699
What's this doll's name?

32:38.700 --> 32:40.200
Beach Bunny Bonnie.

32:40.202 --> 32:42.760
Beach Bunny Bonnie? What kind of a name is that?

32:43.138 --> 32:45.949
I like those names that you gave the dolls the other day.

32:45.950 --> 32:48.829
Uh, "Maye and Wilt" and...

32:48.830 --> 32:51.173
Those aren't doll names, Daddy. Not really.

32:51.174 --> 32:53.099
Well, I know, but I liked them.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.689
Hey, you know what I noticed?

32:54.690 --> 32:56.899
You didn't cut out any dolls out of the paper today.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.359
You told me not to, Daddy!

32:59.360 --> 33:01.299
Yeah, you told her not to, Daddy.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.267
Yes, I know, but I changed my mind.

33:03.268 --> 33:04.308
I'll tell you what, you know.

33:04.309 --> 33:06.733
If you want to cut a couple dolls out of the paper tonight

33:06.734 --> 33:08.200
before you went to bed and name them, you know,

33:08.201 --> 33:11.064
that would be okay with me. If you wanted to.

33:11.065 --> 33:12.949
What do you think? Do you want to do it?

33:12.950 --> 33:15.700
Uh-uh. Paper dolls are for babies!

33:15.800 --> 33:18.133
Wait a second. It'll be fun. Come on.

33:18.134 --> 33:19.130
Cut a couple out.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.800
You can name them anything you want.

33:20.980 --> 33:25.600
Don't you want to make a little, I don't know, Pfizer doll?

33:27.739 --> 33:29.100
How about GE?

33:29.446 --> 33:31.705
Haven't you always wanted a doll named "GE"?

33:31.706 --> 33:33.600
I'm tired, Daddy.

33:34.200 --> 33:35.200
"Apple"?

33:35.807 --> 33:37.409
It worked for Gwyneth Paltrow.

33:57.462 --> 33:59.550
ANSWEAR THE PHONE ALLISION

34:01.600 --> 34:02.700
Devalos.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.200
Hello... sir?

34:06.201 --> 34:08.880
I just got off the phone with the Scottsdale Police.

34:09.007 --> 34:10.250
You may have been right.

34:10.251 --> 34:13.607
Either Kevin Flynn had a partner or Scottsdals got itself a copycat

34:13.608 --> 34:16.239
who wasted no time in picking up where Flynn left off.

34:16.241 --> 34:17.199
Oh, no...

34:17.400 --> 34:20.206
Yeah, they found the body of a young girl in a Dumpster about an hour ago

34:20.206 --> 34:22.739
pummeled to death just the way Flynn used to do it.

34:23.422 --> 34:26.100
She was wearing a necklace with her name on it, wasn't she?

34:26.500 --> 34:27.500
"Tara."

34:27.501 --> 34:30.150
Tara. It was still on her when they found the body.

34:30.350 --> 34:31.800
Did you see anything else?

34:32.360 --> 34:35.900
His face? An address? A license plate?

34:35.900 --> 34:37.699
Yeah. Uh, no.

34:38.650 --> 34:40.199
I'M SO SORRY.

34:42.550 --> 34:44.100
I'm still not sure I understand why

34:44.101 --> 34:46.100
we're driving all the way to Scottsdale.

34:46.449 --> 34:48.402
Any forensic information we want,

34:48.404 --> 34:49.850
they'd be happy to send us.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.400
No, no, I don't think so.

34:52.603 --> 34:53.800
Not what I'm after.

35:07.365 --> 35:09.478
Sir, I know this is a little unusual,

35:09.479 --> 35:12.307
but do you think I could be alone with her for a minute?

35:28.500 --> 35:30.300
I don't know if you're still here.

35:34.140 --> 35:35.880
I don't know if you can hear me...

35:38.780 --> 35:40.950
but I could really use your help.

35:46.850 --> 35:48.400
Did you find what you were looking for?

35:48.703 --> 35:49.650
No.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.100
Honey, just give me...

35:58.101 --> 36:00.100
Yeah, Terry?

36:00.800 --> 36:02.930
No, it's Allison. Go back to sleep.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.400
Go back to sleep, honey.

36:04.401 --> 36:05.600
It's 3:00 in theorning.

36:13.050 --> 36:14.760
Did I just call you Terry?

36:14.800 --> 36:16.200
Yeah, you did.

36:19.701 --> 36:21.700
I-I hope you meant Terry your boss,

36:21.702 --> 36:25.700
not Terry, some young, fetching figment of your imagination.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.450
Young? Fetching?

36:32.700 --> 36:34.440
Why didn't I think about that?

36:36.550 --> 36:41.079
No, I was actually dreaming about my, my employer.

36:41.080 --> 36:44.600
My future former employer.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.550
Come on. You don't know that.

36:46.551 --> 36:47.990
Yes, I do.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.300
He thinks I'm gonna buthe company.

36:51.301 --> 36:54.500
He thinks I've been making a killing in the stock market.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.989
I suppose that...

36:59.450 --> 37:02.800
if you found a way to do it without Marie ever knowing, I mean...

37:03.200 --> 37:05.450
You have nothing to fear.

37:06.030 --> 37:08.400
I think that we may have already

37:08.530 --> 37:10.500
missed the boat on that one.

37:12.250 --> 37:15.200
Somebody's knocked the Warren Buffet right out of her.

37:18.300 --> 37:20.760
So, any luck in Scottsdale?

37:21.400 --> 37:22.200
No.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.990
I think he's done it. He's right.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.300
I'm broken.

37:32.940 --> 37:34.850
what's going on in your head?

37:36.380 --> 37:40.400
I've finally been thinking about all the ugly things that he's been saying to me.

37:42.900 --> 37:45.400
I guess I can't help but wonder...

37:47.200 --> 37:49.600
where is God in all this?

37:52.400 --> 37:55.990
I mean, I really do believe that I see these things for a reason.

37:57.380 --> 37:59.034
And the reason is to help people

37:59.035 --> 38:01.801
to-to make things right.

38:05.240 --> 38:08.800
But if that's the case, then how could he be allowed to do this?

38:09.650 --> 38:10.660
Maybe it just...

38:12.400 --> 38:14.940
It makes me question everything.

38:16.020 --> 38:17.200
My God!

38:18.000 --> 38:21.200
And I do mean "my God."

38:22.650 --> 38:24.800
You sound incredibly bleak.

38:25.450 --> 38:27.200
Almost suicidal.

38:40.800 --> 38:41.800
Leave my home!

38:41.802 --> 38:43.800
Leave this life.

38:44.500 --> 38:45.948
It's honestly the only way

38:45.950 --> 38:48.100
you'll ever rid yourself of m Allison.

38:48.540 --> 38:49.700
I'm staying

38:49.701 --> 38:52.990
in your home, in your head, in your dreams.

38:53.500 --> 38:54.700
I'm cancer.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.500
I live in you.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.700
So what shall it be?

39:00.100 --> 39:01.540
There's knives in the kitchen.

39:01.850 --> 39:03.300
Perhaps one through the heart?

39:03.301 --> 39:05.800
We could sit in the closed garage with the car running.

39:06.020 --> 39:08.099
I'd let you pick the radio station we listen to

39:08.100 --> 39:10.541
as the carbon monoxide suffocates you to death.

39:10.542 --> 39:13.170
Forget that. How about some lye?

39:13.707 --> 39:15.550
Why don't you drink a cup or so,

39:15.700 --> 39:17.807
then stumble into your little girls' room

39:17.808 --> 39:20.000
so they can watch you writhe to death

39:20.001 --> 39:22.030
as it eats through your organs?

39:22.930 --> 39:24.300
Come on, Allison.

39:25.164 --> 39:26.770
It's time for you to move on.

39:27.073 --> 39:31.300
Actually... we think 's time for you to move on.

39:33.200 --> 39:36.038
Remember me? I'm the most recent girl

39:36.039 --> 39:38.019
that Donald Crommler gassed, bound,

39:38.020 --> 39:40.200
and beat the holy hell out of.

39:42.940 --> 39:45.600
"Donald Crommler." That's his name.

39:46.400 --> 39:49.700
He lives in Scottsdale on Desert Oasis Road.

39:50.500 --> 39:54.800
That's what you came to the morgue to find out this evening, right?

39:57.300 --> 39:59.100
She could have stopped it from happening.

39:59.506 --> 40:01.903
You should have let her stop it from happening.

40:01.904 --> 40:03.300
It was supposed to happen.

40:03.301 --> 40:04.630
It was meant to be.

40:04.632 --> 40:07.300
No. The only thing that is meant to be

40:07.615 --> 40:09.300
is for you to burn in hell.

40:09.650 --> 40:11.201
And that's where we mean to take you.

40:11.202 --> 40:12.180
"We"?

40:13.990 --> 40:14.990
Who's "we"?

40:22.300 --> 40:23.850
It's your fault we're dead.

40:24.448 --> 40:27.800
You interfered with the dreams of the people who could have saved us.

40:28.100 --> 40:29.900
All because you thought they were evil.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.700
But those people,

40:32.141 --> 40:35.455
the dreamers-- they're not evil.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.400
You are.

40:37.900 --> 40:38.900
What are you doing?

40:38.950 --> 40:40.600
It's time to meet your maker.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.500
It's good you're dressed for the heat.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Donald Crommler.

41:38.525 --> 41:40.100
Desert Oasis Road.

41:40.550 --> 41:43.400
Donald Crommler. Desert Oasis Road.

41:43.403 --> 41:45.558
Donald Crommler. Desert Oasis Road.

41:45.559 --> 41:46.700
What are you doing?

41:47.248 --> 41:48.400
What's going on?

41:49.200 --> 41:50.300
Is everything all right?

41:51.450 --> 41:53.450
Yeah. No. I'm good.

41:53.451 --> 41:54.900
I think I'm great.

41:56.070 --> 41:57.600
I just gotta make a phone call.

42:02.930 --> 42:04.300
Everything is great.

42:05.305 --> 42:11.878
