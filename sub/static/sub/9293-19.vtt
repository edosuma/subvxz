00:13.267 --> 00:14.700
This is Bauer.
Let me speak to Audrey.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.700
Her well-being's entirely
up yo you, Mr. Bauer

00:19.000 --> 00:24.500
What we want is a component
from the triggering mechanism
the FB sub circuit board

00:24.700 --> 00:28.567
You give me the component
I give you Audrey

00:31.167 --> 00:32.767
<i>DOYLE:
Stand down, Jack!
I can't do that.</i>

00:33.134 --> 00:35.733
I won't say it again. Drop it!
Agent Doyle, I am following
orders that exceed

00:35.800 --> 00:38.434
you're security clearance...
He's a rogue agent.
Take him out.

00:40.034 --> 00:42.600
It's my understanding, Jack,
that component

00:42.667 --> 00:45.301
holds the key to Russian
defense codes.

00:45.367 --> 00:47.334
<i>JACK:
I need the Chinese to believe</i>

00:47.401 --> 00:49.267
that I'm willing to go through
with this exchange.

00:49.334 --> 00:52.667
I will destroy the circuit board
with a concealed charge of C-4.

00:52.733 --> 00:54.134
You're going to sacrifice
yourself?

00:54.201 --> 00:55.401
Yes, sir, if I have to.

00:55.468 --> 00:56.900
You're asking me to sign off

00:56.967 --> 00:58.667
on a probable suicide mission.

00:58.733 --> 01:01.301
Mr. President...

01:01.367 --> 01:03.834
you owe me.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.767
JACK:
I want you to help me retrieve
one of those circuit boards.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.700
<i>CHLOE:
I'm sending it to your system.</i>

01:08.767 --> 01:10.301
The Russians have been trying
to keep that technology

01:10.367 --> 01:12.700
out of Chinese hands for years.
I did it for Jack.

01:12.767 --> 01:14.167
Well, what are the Russians
going to say

01:14.234 --> 01:15.767
when they find out
we just gave it to them?

01:15.834 --> 01:17.600
Well, it's not going
to get that far.

01:17.667 --> 01:19.434
You have to tell Buchanan.

01:19.501 --> 01:21.700
Chloe, I want you to stand down
on this operation.

01:21.767 --> 01:24.134
You've shown me
I can't trust you.

01:24.201 --> 01:26.534
First I want to say that
I'm grateful to report

01:26.600 --> 01:28.767
that all nuclear devices
have been recovered.

01:28.834 --> 01:30.301
Based on the intelligence
that I've seen,

01:30.367 --> 01:32.201
I can say with full confidence

01:32.267 --> 01:34.167
that-that-that
that we will, uh...

01:34.234 --> 01:36.134
(groans)

01:36.201 --> 01:38.667
Get medical right away!

01:38.733 --> 01:41.568
Notify the Senate and the House
of the transfer of power

01:41.633 --> 01:44.201
and the Sec Def and the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs

01:44.267 --> 01:45.800
authorize me under
the 25th Amendment.

01:48.134 --> 01:50.568
Wayne Palmer just issued
a finding allowing Jack Bauer

01:50.633 --> 01:52.967
to hand classified Russian
technology over to the Chinese

01:53.034 --> 01:55.501
in exchange for the return
of a covertly held hostage.

01:55.568 --> 01:58.334
Bauer has guaranteed
that the technology

01:58.401 --> 02:01.134
will not fall into the hands
of the Chinese.

02:01.201 --> 02:04.367
Even Jack Bauer can't
guarantee that outcome.

02:04.434 --> 02:06.934
Tell CTU to stop Bauer.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.699
CTU has the signal.
They're monitoring the device.

02:10.767 --> 02:12.301
We're set. Let's go.

02:12.367 --> 02:13.301
(phone ringing)

02:13.367 --> 02:15.468
Doyle.

02:15.534 --> 02:17.167
<i>BUCHANAN:
Noah Daniels
is acting president.</i>

02:17.234 --> 02:19.568
He wants the operation shut down

02:19.633 --> 02:21.367
and Jack brought back
to CTU immediately.

02:21.434 --> 02:22.468
Understood.

02:22.534 --> 02:23.834
Don't you move.

02:23.900 --> 02:25.867
Jack...

02:25.934 --> 02:28.301
Slowly I want you to pull over.

02:28.367 --> 02:30.067
Now.

02:30.134 --> 02:32.334
This is going
to end badly, Jack.

02:32.401 --> 02:35.134
You can't go against
the White House.

02:49.134 --> 02:50.167
Wait! Wait!

02:50.234 --> 02:51.334
Stop! Stop!

02:51.401 --> 02:53.934
(horn honking)
Stop! Stop!

02:54.000 --> 02:58.067
(tires screeching)
Wait! Wait! Stop your car! Stop!

02:58.134 --> 02:59.900
Stop!

02:59.967 --> 03:02.401
Stop! Stop!

03:02.468 --> 03:04.700
What the hell?!
Are you crazy?!

03:04.767 --> 03:07.934
I'm a federal agent in pursuit.
I need the vehicle.
Where's your badge?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.934
(horns honking)

03:10.000 --> 03:11.934
(tires screeching)

03:25.800 --> 03:27.834
(phone ringing)
Pressman.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.201
Milo, it's Doyle.
I need to speak with Buchanan.

03:30.267 --> 03:31.667
Hold on.

03:31.733 --> 03:34.700
Sir, Doyle's on line one.

03:36.101 --> 03:37.600
Mike, it's Bill.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.600
Do you have Jack in custody?
No, he got the drop on me

03:39.667 --> 03:42.534
before I could get the
component-- I screwed up.
Where are you?

03:42.600 --> 03:44.700
I acquired another
vehicle and I'm in pursuit.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.600
Morris, do you have
Jack's position?
Yeah.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.267
The tracker's still embedded
in the sub-board.

03:48.334 --> 03:50.167
He's heading north on the 118.
Copy that.

03:50.234 --> 03:52.101
Mike, Jack's going
to disengage that tracker

03:52.167 --> 03:53.267
the first
chance he gets.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.834
I'll get him
before he does.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.568
All right, listen up.

03:56.633 --> 03:58.568
Jack Bauer has gone rogue.

03:58.633 --> 04:01.034
He has in possession
the FB sub-circuit board.

04:01.101 --> 04:02.800
Mike Doyle is in pursuit.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.201
He needs all
available resources

04:04.267 --> 04:06.633
to stop Jack and
recover the component

04:06.700 --> 04:08.401
before he gives it
to the Chinese.

04:08.468 --> 04:10.134
Chloe.

04:10.201 --> 04:13.401
I need you on task.
You said that...

04:13.468 --> 04:14.767
I know what I said.

04:14.834 --> 04:18.434
I need my best people
looking for Jack.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.367
Can I trust you
to help me do that?

04:20.434 --> 04:22.534
Yes, sir.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.934
Good. Thank you.

04:34.534 --> 04:37.834
MORRIS:
Oh, that's bloody marvelous.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.000
What?
I just lost
Jack's signal.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.201
How'd you do that?

04:40.267 --> 04:41.568
I didn't do anything.
It just disappeared.

04:43.633 --> 04:45.434
(electrical wires crackling)

05:13.100 --> 05:15.100
CHLOE:
There must be something
in the transit ph.

05:15.101 --> 05:16.711
You don't have to state
the obvious, Chloe.

05:16.712 --> 05:18.834
I know there's something
interfering, I'm  trying
to figure out what it is.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.201
CHLOE:
This doesn't have
to be personal.

05:20.267 --> 05:22.468
Can we just figure it out?
It's not personal,
and I've figured it out.

05:22.534 --> 05:24.301
This stretch of road
runs right along

05:24.367 --> 05:25.767
the main voltage feed
for the Valley,

05:25.834 --> 05:28.167
and Jack is using
the power lines as a shield

05:28.234 --> 05:30.101
while he separates
the tracker from
the sub-board.

05:30.167 --> 05:32.800
Can you keep an eye
on things? Can you?

05:32.867 --> 05:35.101
I have to explain this
to Buchanan.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.967
Hey, I thought
you got sidelined.

05:45.034 --> 05:46.767
Buchanan wants me to help
find Jack.

05:46.834 --> 05:49.468
Which is going to be harder now
that he's dumped the tracker.

05:49.534 --> 05:50.733
Did you pull up Caltrans?

05:50.800 --> 05:52.767
Yeah.

05:52.834 --> 05:53.934
I just can't believe that Jack

05:54.000 --> 05:55.468
would give up the circuit board
to the Chinese.

05:55.534 --> 05:56.733
Jack would die

05:56.800 --> 05:58.201
before he gives up that
component to the Chinese.

05:58.267 --> 05:59.767
I agree with you.

05:59.834 --> 06:03.267
The question is... would Jack
give up Audrey's life?

06:05.767 --> 06:08.667
Exactly.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.468
Look, I'll...

06:10.534 --> 06:11.900
I'll check the satellites.

06:11.967 --> 06:13.767
See if they've restored any
coverage in that area.

06:13.834 --> 06:15.000
If you find anything,

06:15.067 --> 06:18.401
send it to me, Doyle and LAPD.

06:18.468 --> 06:20.067
How much farther?
We lost Jack

06:20.134 --> 06:21.834
eight miles north
of your current location.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.834
We think he used the power
lines as a shield

06:23.900 --> 06:24.934
while he removed
the tracker.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.101
You're headed in
the right direction.

06:26.167 --> 06:27.934
See you if you can
pick up a trail.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.134
I'll call you back
when I get closer.
Thank you, Morris.

06:30.201 --> 06:32.501
All right.

06:32.568 --> 06:34.733
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a brief statement

06:34.800 --> 06:37.334
and I will not be taking any
questions at this time.

06:37.401 --> 06:38.834
The President is en route

06:38.900 --> 06:40.900
to Bethesda Naval Hospital
and will arrive shortly.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.034
The doctors have no idea
whether or not

06:43.101 --> 06:45.334
President Palmer
will come out of his coma

06:45.401 --> 06:47.267
in hours, days or weeks.

06:47.334 --> 06:49.501
Vice President Daniels will be
addressing the country

06:49.568 --> 06:51.000
at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.

06:51.067 --> 06:53.501
Thank you.

06:53.568 --> 06:56.101
That's all, everyone.

06:56.167 --> 06:59.067
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

06:59.134 --> 07:00.733
Tom...
Yes, sir.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.700
Stick around.
I want to talk to you.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.934
All right, sir.

07:09.934 --> 07:11.767
We need to clear the air,
you and I.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.767
You still have
evidence

07:13.834 --> 07:16.000
that could hurt me,

07:16.067 --> 07:17.867
and I'd like to know what
your intentions are.

07:17.934 --> 07:20.867
Truthfully, sir, I haven't
given it much thought.

07:20.934 --> 07:24.101
Why don't you think
about it now.

07:24.167 --> 07:28.134
All right, sir.

07:28.201 --> 07:32.434
It concerns me that you engaged
in conspiracy and perjury

07:32.501 --> 07:34.334
to achieve
political ends.

07:34.401 --> 07:35.700
I don't think

07:35.767 --> 07:37.534
that's behavior befitting

07:37.600 --> 07:39.568
the acting president
of the United States.

07:39.633 --> 07:43.900
Tom, the world has changed
in the last half hour.

07:43.967 --> 07:48.800
Right now, this country,
above all, needs stability.

07:48.867 --> 07:50.334
If I'm brought up on charges

07:50.401 --> 07:51.834
in the first hours
of this presidency,

07:51.900 --> 07:53.733
then America's left without

07:53.800 --> 07:54.934
elected leadership.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.568
If I might just complete
my thought, sir--

07:56.633 --> 07:59.334
I made that tape both to back
you off your challenge

07:59.401 --> 08:00.767
to President Palmer,

08:00.834 --> 08:03.000
but also to protect me.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.267
Now that was,

08:05.334 --> 08:07.568
and remains,
my only reason.

08:07.633 --> 08:08.867
What about forcing
my resignation?

08:08.934 --> 08:11.034
That was Wayne Palmer's idea,
not mine.

08:13.834 --> 08:16.367
So...

08:16.434 --> 08:20.334
you're okay then
with me in this chair?

08:20.401 --> 08:25.934
Sir, it's no secret
that policy-wise

08:26.000 --> 08:28.101
you and I are in alignment.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.633
I just simply hate
how we got here.

08:30.700 --> 08:33.167
Now that we are here?

08:35.933 --> 08:37.933
Yes, sir, you have my support.

08:40.866 --> 08:43.501
(sighs)

08:43.568 --> 08:48.267
In the event that we ever get
out of alignment...

08:48.334 --> 08:51.301
I can't have you holding
this evidence

08:51.367 --> 08:52.867
over my head.

08:52.934 --> 08:54.967
It's understood, sir.
You have my word.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.000
All right, Tom.

08:57.067 --> 09:01.501
Glad to have you with me.

09:01.568 --> 09:03.000
Now what do you suggest

09:03.067 --> 09:05.900
we do with Karen Hayes?

09:05.967 --> 09:07.000
Will she slow us down?

09:07.067 --> 09:09.101
Of course she might,

09:09.167 --> 09:11.334
but she is smart,
she brings balance.

09:14.301 --> 09:15.633
Fine, then she stays.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.301
Right. May I let her know, sir?

09:17.367 --> 09:20.434
Sure.

09:20.501 --> 09:22.101
Tom.

09:22.167 --> 09:24.101
Thank you.

09:24.167 --> 09:25.767
Thank you, sir.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.401
(phone ringing)

09:34.468 --> 09:35.600
Yes.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.733
This is Bauer. I just passed
mile marker 49.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.633
I have the sub-circuit
board with me.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.600
Good. Go east on
the 118...

09:41.667 --> 09:44.034
No, from this point forward
we do this my way.

09:44.101 --> 09:47.568
Don't test me, Mr. Bauer.

09:47.633 --> 09:49.034
Yes, I want
the component,

09:49.101 --> 09:50.934
but Audrey Raines' life
means nothing to me.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Listen to me.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.468
CTU is looking for me.

09:53.534 --> 09:55.334
They want to stop
the exchange from happening.

09:55.401 --> 09:56.367
I know their satellite coverage.

09:56.434 --> 09:58.633
I need to pick the location.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.867
All right.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.434
Where?

10:02.501 --> 10:04.501
There's an abandoned motel
called the Calderone

10:04.568 --> 10:06.633
off of Highway 305.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.434
Come through the
front door alone.

10:08.501 --> 10:10.334
We'll make
the exchange there.

10:10.401 --> 10:15.367
We both have a chance to get
what we want here, Mr. Bauer.

10:15.434 --> 10:18.034
Don't attempt anything foolish.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.334
We're leaving now,
Ms. Raines.

10:22.401 --> 10:23.867
(speaking Chinese)

10:47.334 --> 10:49.601
I spoke with Bill,
and he assures me

10:49.667 --> 10:51.834
that CTU has deployed all its
resources to find Bauer.

10:51.900 --> 10:54.567
I don't want to hear about
their assurances, Karen.

10:54.634 --> 10:56.134
They let Bauer steal
the component,

10:56.200 --> 10:57.434
so their assurances
mean nothing.

10:57.501 --> 10:59.734
Well, if I may, sir.

10:59.801 --> 11:01.200
I could authorize

11:01.267 --> 11:03.367
ancillary agencies
to join the search.

11:03.434 --> 11:04.734
That would increase
our chances

11:04.801 --> 11:05.734
of finding Bauer.

11:05.801 --> 11:07.033
Do it.

11:17.701 --> 11:19.601
Is there anything else
you need from me?

11:19.667 --> 11:23.501
Is there anything else
I need from you?

11:23.567 --> 11:25.634
Let me think.

11:25.701 --> 11:29.267
(sighs)

11:29.334 --> 11:32.000
I have the fate
of the Western world

11:32.067 --> 11:34.868
and the lives of millions of
Americans hanging in the balance

11:34.933 --> 11:39.300
and I can't...
stop thinking about you.

11:39.367 --> 11:42.167
I'm not sure this is
appropriate behavior,

11:42.234 --> 11:43.967
Mr. Acting President.

11:44.033 --> 11:48.534
Well, there's the phone,
call to the media.

11:48.601 --> 11:53.000
Tell them the acting
president's a dirty old man.

11:53.067 --> 11:55.100
They already know.

12:12.768 --> 12:14.900
I would like for you...

12:17.100 --> 12:18.933
to spend what's left
of the night.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.634
I'll go home and pick up
a change of clothes.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.834
Good.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.933
I'm at the Tampa exit
by the power lines.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.601
It matches the last
coordinates Morris had

12:51.667 --> 12:53.534
before the tracker
stopped working.
Mike, it's Bill.

12:53.601 --> 12:56.067
The White House is telling me
if the Chinese get ahold

12:56.134 --> 12:57.434
of this sub-circuit
board, we'll have

12:57.501 --> 12:59.167
an international
incident on our hands.

12:59.234 --> 13:00.501
I know the stakes, Bill.

13:00.567 --> 13:03.234
Have you been able to figure
out where Jack's headed?

13:03.300 --> 13:05.000
I'm working on it now.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.134
It looks like he headed east.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.501
What's up ahead?

13:16.567 --> 13:18.334
Two state routes,

13:18.401 --> 13:20.868
the 305 and the 98.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.334
Do you have
satellite on both?

13:22.401 --> 13:23.834
No. The radiation
from the fallout

13:23.900 --> 13:25.267
made that area
hard to cover.

13:25.334 --> 13:27.634
But the 98 has
Caltrans cameras--
I can check them.

13:27.701 --> 13:28.967
No, don't bother.

13:29.033 --> 13:30.801
Jack would know about
those-- he's on the 305.

13:30.868 --> 13:32.434
And check the cell
towers in the area.

13:32.501 --> 13:35.401
See if you can pick up a phone
call between Jack and Cheng.

13:35.467 --> 13:38.401
And I think I saw Jack pick up
one of the terrorist's phones

13:38.467 --> 13:40.534
at the warehouse-- that
might help narrow things down.

13:42.967 --> 13:45.267
Chloe's got that grid
on her system-- get it from her.

13:45.334 --> 13:46.401
Who's that?

13:46.467 --> 13:48.768
Doyle. He thinks
Jack's on the 305.

13:48.834 --> 13:50.501
How would he know that?

13:50.567 --> 13:51.801
He figured it out.

13:51.868 --> 13:53.367
Chloe, I need you to pull

13:53.434 --> 13:54.834
the logs on grid 19-dash-12.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.234
Get everything off that cell
tower for the last 15 minutes.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.200
What am I looking for?
I think Jack's using

13:59.267 --> 14:01.367
one of the terrorist's
phones that were tagged
at the warehouse.

14:01.434 --> 14:03.534
Check all outgoing calls.
We'll get it.

14:05.234 --> 14:06.900
Oh, um...

14:06.967 --> 14:08.634
what is this?
Those are today's

14:08.701 --> 14:10.300
decryption schemes
from the cell towers.

14:10.367 --> 14:12.167
I'm sending you
some scrambled calls.

14:12.234 --> 14:13.768
We're looking for a conversation

14:13.834 --> 14:15.933
between Jack and Cheng.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.367
Why didn't you speak to me first
before over-writing my screen?

14:18.434 --> 14:20.567
I don't know,
that's just the way I did it.

14:20.634 --> 14:23.467
Okay, okay. We're being
a little hostile, aren't we?
Fine.

14:23.534 --> 14:25.401
I'm hostile,
but I just didn't get there--

14:25.467 --> 14:28.234
you pushed me halfway.
Actually, you're right--
it's my fault, all my fault.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.000
I didn't say
it's all your fault.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.367
I said halfway, 50%,

14:31.434 --> 14:33.200
point-five-- see,
you don't listen to me.

14:33.267 --> 14:35.601
That's why I just sent it
to your screen.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.467
Hey, guys.

14:37.534 --> 14:40.033
What's going on?
My ex-wife

14:40.100 --> 14:43.300
is suddenly showing signs
of irrational behavior.

14:43.367 --> 14:44.467
Okay.

14:44.534 --> 14:46.300
Do you know how
to defrag Huffman keys?

14:46.367 --> 14:49.768
Yeah. Why?
Can you help me out with this?

14:49.834 --> 14:52.334
Yeah.
Great. I'll just send
the files to your system.

14:56.134 --> 14:57.834
That's a really good idea.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.900
You should work with Milo--
you know, get cozy.
Would you please

15:00.967 --> 15:02.000
stop acting like this?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.933
I really hate it.
Why don't you

15:04.000 --> 15:06.267
write down the way
you want me to act,

15:06.334 --> 15:10.234
put it in a file, tab delimited,
the Milo loves it, and...

15:10.300 --> 15:11.667
shove it.

15:11.734 --> 15:13.734
Okay. I'll write it down--
the first item on the list

15:13.801 --> 15:15.300
would be:
"Don't be such a jealous jerk."

15:15.367 --> 15:18.200
Okay. Um, the day I'm jealous
is the day I kill myself.

15:18.267 --> 15:19.634
Is there anything else?

15:19.701 --> 15:22.200
How about: "Don't arm nuclear
bombs for terrorists"?

15:23.267 --> 15:25.801
(exhales)

15:26.933 --> 15:29.534
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

15:31.601 --> 15:33.601
That's not how I feel.

15:36.701 --> 15:38.634
Yeah, it is.

15:38.701 --> 15:41.834
No, it's not.
It just slipped out of my mouth.

15:43.534 --> 15:44.801
Morris...

15:50.367 --> 15:51.801
I'll call Mel
over at the FBI,

15:51.868 --> 15:53.667
get them to share
resources with Bill.

15:53.734 --> 15:55.401
(phone rings)
Good, and I'll... Oh.

15:55.467 --> 15:56.868
Excuse me.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.434
Yeah?

15:58.501 --> 16:01.100
Okay.

16:01.167 --> 16:04.734
Well, tell him
I'll be right there.

16:04.801 --> 16:06.067
That's strange.

16:06.134 --> 16:07.868
Peter Hock
is in my office,

16:07.933 --> 16:11.200
and he wants to talk to me.
Department of Justice?
What is that about?

16:11.267 --> 16:13.367
I have no idea.
Be careful, Karen.

16:13.434 --> 16:17.334
He's got a lot of
clout on the Hill.
I know. I'll call you.

16:23.467 --> 16:25.033
Peter.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.768
Early enough for you?

16:26.834 --> 16:28.234
(laughs)

16:28.300 --> 16:30.100
So, what's going on?
It sounded urgent.

16:30.167 --> 16:31.734
You know that
I've been interrogating

16:31.801 --> 16:34.434
Tom's chief of staff,
Reed Pollock, after his arrest.

16:34.501 --> 16:35.900
That must be pleasant.

16:35.967 --> 16:37.701
(chuckles)

16:37.768 --> 16:39.900
Pollock's looking at a
probable death sentence

16:39.967 --> 16:43.100
for his part in the
assassination attempt
on Wayne Palmer.
Mm-hmm.

16:43.167 --> 16:45.601
Out of desperation, he's
offering up everything he knows,

16:45.667 --> 16:47.434
hoping we'll show
some leniency.

16:47.501 --> 16:50.768
And what does that
have to do with me?
Not just you, this involves

16:50.834 --> 16:52.134
your husband as well.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.900
Take a look.

16:59.734 --> 17:01.367
Listen to me, Peter.

17:01.434 --> 17:03.200
You and I both know
that there are

17:03.267 --> 17:05.900
going to be endless hearings
looking into how Fayedmanaged

17:05.967 --> 17:07.567
to acquire the nukes.

17:07.634 --> 17:09.867
PETER:
And you know something
about that?

17:09.933 --> 17:11.501
I can give you key information

17:11.567 --> 17:14.267
that will help keep blame
away from this administration.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.601
PETER:
I'm listening.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.032
POLLOCK:
Well, I'm not saying anything

17:17.099 --> 17:18.768
until I have some sort
of deal, in writing.

17:18.834 --> 17:20.099
He's such a weasel.

17:20.166 --> 17:24.501
We, uh, danced around
for 20 minutes, then he...

17:24.567 --> 17:26.233
said this.

17:26.300 --> 17:30.100
I'm telling you...
exactly what happened.

17:30.167 --> 17:31.567
Bill Buchanan

17:31.634 --> 17:35.933
had Fayed in custody,
and he let him go.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.634
PETER:
And where's the proof?

17:37.701 --> 17:39.434
POLLOCK:
Karen Hayes put it

17:39.501 --> 17:42.134
in a blue file over at Homeland.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.967
That's a cover-up.

17:44.033 --> 17:46.167
And if you don't believe me,

17:46.234 --> 17:48.933
I have recorded conversations
with Peter Iannone,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.900
Kurt Hueig and Myra Mawk,

17:51.967 --> 17:55.134
and they will all testify
that she sequestered the file

17:55.200 --> 17:57.134
to protect her husband.

18:01.033 --> 18:03.267
Do me a favor, Karen.

18:03.334 --> 18:06.033
Save me some time.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.734
Is it true or not?

18:07.801 --> 18:09.100
The facts are true.

18:09.167 --> 18:10.868
But there's no
cover-up here, Peter.

18:10.933 --> 18:12.967
About two years ago,

18:13.033 --> 18:16.734
we apprehended Fayed as part
of an FBI-CTU border sweep.

18:16.801 --> 18:17.933
There wasn't enough

18:18.000 --> 18:19.967
to hold him,
he was one of many,

18:20.033 --> 18:21.768
<i>and he was maybe
a mid-level player.</i>

18:21.834 --> 18:24.200
And that turned out
to be wrong.

18:24.267 --> 18:26.367
Fayed wasn't part of a cell;
he wasn't funded.

18:26.434 --> 18:28.134
This all happened
after he was released.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.501
So why was it blue-coded?
Every year,

18:30.567 --> 18:32.534
thousands of suspects
are arrested.

18:32.601 --> 18:35.501
If there isn't enough evidence
to hold them, they're released

18:35.567 --> 18:37.300
and blue-coded-- that's
just standard procedure.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.834
<i>The only way to guarantee
that no one becomes</i>

18:39.900 --> 18:42.167
a threat is to hold everyone
and deprive them

18:42.234 --> 18:43.467
of their rights and freedom.

18:43.534 --> 18:45.634
All right, Karen,
then if this was a no-fault,

18:45.701 --> 18:48.534
why did this carry so much
weight with you 12 hours ago.

18:48.601 --> 18:50.067
Why did you resign

18:50.134 --> 18:51.900
rather than have this come out?

18:51.967 --> 18:54.734
Come on, Peter,
we were under attack.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.467
There was no way I was gonna
let this information touch

18:57.534 --> 18:58.834
the president or my husband.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.933
They needed to lead us
through this crisis unimpeded.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.401
Well, here we are,

19:02.467 --> 19:04.033
12 hours later,

19:04.100 --> 19:05.634
Palmer's in a coma,

19:05.701 --> 19:08.834
the country's in shock
after losing over 13,000

19:08.900 --> 19:12.900
innocent lives, and all people
are going to be asking

19:12.967 --> 19:15.801
is who let this happen?

19:15.868 --> 19:18.734
<i>Well, certainly not my husband.</i>

19:18.801 --> 19:20.567
He has devoted his life

19:20.634 --> 19:22.367
to this country.

19:22.434 --> 19:26.200
This isn't my call, Karen, but
I think you know how this works.

19:26.267 --> 19:28.567
Someone's going to have
to go down.

19:28.634 --> 19:30.467
And the farther
from the president

19:30.534 --> 19:32.401
the better.

19:32.467 --> 19:35.000
So what exactly are you saying?

19:35.067 --> 19:37.667
It's going to be
either you or Bill.

19:37.734 --> 19:40.234
Bill would be
my preference--

19:40.300 --> 19:42.401
he's lower on the food chain.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.434
But you'll do.

21:25.401 --> 21:27.034
(phone rings)
Doyle.

21:27.101 --> 21:28.934
NADIA:
We found Jack's call to Cheng.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.334
What'd he say?

21:30.401 --> 21:31.934
We haven't decrypted it yet,
but the triangulation

21:32.000 --> 21:34.667
shows he's traveling north on
the 305 just like you thought.

21:34.733 --> 21:36.667
Anything between me
and Santa Maria?

21:36.733 --> 21:39.501
Uh, some small populated areas
in the county, unincorporated.

21:39.568 --> 21:41.600
When does
the next one come up?

21:41.667 --> 21:43.234
About nine miles
from where you are now.

21:43.301 --> 21:44.267
All right, check it out,

21:44.334 --> 21:45.667
and keep working
on that decryption.

21:45.733 --> 21:47.834
I want to know what Cheng
and Jack said to each other.

21:47.900 --> 21:50.334
Okay.
Are we converging
on Jack?

21:50.401 --> 21:52.167
(phone rings)
Yeah. Doyle's...

21:52.234 --> 21:54.600
Excuse me. Hi.

21:54.667 --> 21:56.767
KAREN:
Hi. It's me.
Do you have a minute?

21:56.834 --> 21:59.301
No. We're closing in on Jack.
What is it?

21:59.367 --> 22:00.700
We have to talk about something.

22:00.767 --> 22:03.234
Why don't you call me
when you have a few minutes.

22:03.301 --> 22:05.967
Okay. Everything all right?

22:06.034 --> 22:09.900
Just... do what you have to do
and call me when you can, okay?

22:09.967 --> 22:11.600
All right.
Bye.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.867
Yes?
Well, Doyle's headed
in the right direction.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.434
He can't be that
far behind.

22:17.501 --> 22:20.234
We may have a chance to stop
Jack before he reaches Cheng.

22:20.301 --> 22:23.034
He's traveling north on the 305.

22:23.101 --> 22:25.234
About there.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.767
Hey, let me call you back.

22:30.834 --> 22:33.468
Has CTU made any progress
in locating Bauer?

22:33.534 --> 22:37.167
They're closing in, but they
don't have him in custody yet.

22:37.234 --> 22:39.167
You were right about Hock, Tom.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.967
I need to talk to you.
All right, shoot.

22:42.034 --> 22:44.667
Remember earlier when
you threatened to use

22:44.733 --> 22:47.667
that information about Fayed
to damage Bill and me?

22:47.733 --> 22:49.034
Karen, yeah, mea culpa.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.334
Wh-Why are we dredging
this up now?
No, no.

22:51.401 --> 22:53.067
Tom, it's not me.

22:53.134 --> 22:54.468
It's Reed Pollock.

22:54.534 --> 22:56.534
He's looking for anything

22:56.600 --> 22:59.568
to bargain his way out
of the death penalty.
Well, he can't.

22:59.633 --> 23:02.667
Well, whether he can or he
can't, that ship has sailed.

23:02.733 --> 23:05.934
Hock knows now that we released
Fayed from our custody

23:06.000 --> 23:08.534
two years ago
in Seattle.
Okay, okay.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.534
What does Hock want?
Distance from the presidency.

23:13.967 --> 23:18.367
Ah, so in other words,
either you or Bill

23:18.434 --> 23:21.700
has to take the blame.
Yeah. But it's more
than blame, Tom.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.234
There's gonna be inquiries,

23:23.301 --> 23:25.267
indictments, investigations--
lives will be ruined.

23:25.334 --> 23:27.067
Not lives, careers.

23:27.134 --> 23:28.667
Or rather, one career.

23:28.733 --> 23:30.468
And it can't be yours.

23:30.534 --> 23:34.201
Well, I can't do
that to Bill, Tom.

23:34.267 --> 23:37.501
He's my husband.
Well, he can go on
being your husband,

23:37.568 --> 23:39.468
but he sure can't
keep running CTU.

23:39.534 --> 23:41.667
(sighs)

23:41.733 --> 23:43.733
Well, if he goes,
then I'm gonna resign.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.568
Haven't you already
resigned once today?

23:45.633 --> 23:50.167
Karen, that's Bill's signature
on Fayed's release document.

23:50.234 --> 23:52.167
Now, it's over for Bill.

23:52.234 --> 23:55.301
It's not for you-- I mean,
you've got a job here.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.568
Just do it.

23:58.934 --> 24:00.301
(sighs)

24:00.367 --> 24:02.468
Tom, how can I ask him

24:02.534 --> 24:03.967
to step down?

24:04.034 --> 24:05.900
You don't ask--
you simply remind him

24:05.967 --> 24:08.501
that the man he personally
let out of jail

24:08.568 --> 24:10.367
killed over 13,000 people
this morning.

24:10.434 --> 24:13.367
Tom, he is not
responsible for that.

24:13.434 --> 24:16.134
Karen, it doesn't matter.
He has been amazing today!

24:16.201 --> 24:19.334
Look, look, look, the only way
for you to protect yourself

24:19.401 --> 24:22.401
is to leave no doubt
in anybody's mind

24:22.468 --> 24:23.733
where your true loyalty lies.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.800
Now, they got Bill in
the crosshairs, okay?

24:25.867 --> 24:28.167
You want to stand shoulder
to should with your husband,

24:28.234 --> 24:29.834
that's your call.

24:29.900 --> 24:31.434
(sighs)

24:32.700 --> 24:34.667
(sighs)

25:09.767 --> 25:12.034
(ringing)

25:12.101 --> 25:13.267
This is Bill Buchanan.

25:13.334 --> 25:15.468
If your matter is urgent,
please dial zero.

25:15.534 --> 25:17.101
If this is not an urgent call,

25:17.167 --> 25:18.900
please leave a message
at the beep.

25:18.967 --> 25:19.934
(beep)

25:20.000 --> 25:21.733
Bill, it's Jack.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.134
I'm about to meet with Cheng

25:23.201 --> 25:25.733
and exchange the FB
sub-circuit board for Audrey.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.534
Hopefully,
by the time you hear this,

25:27.600 --> 25:31.067
she'll be safe
and in your custody.

25:31.134 --> 25:32.501
Bill, I know
I promised the president

25:32.568 --> 25:33.934
that I would give him
confirmation

25:34.000 --> 25:37.267
that the circuit board did
not fall into the wrong hands.

25:37.334 --> 25:39.267
This message
is your confirmation.

25:39.334 --> 25:43.600
The circuit board will be
incinerated in the explosion.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.067
The meeting will take place
at the Calderone Motel

25:46.134 --> 25:47.633
off of Highway 305.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.967
Bill...

25:53.034 --> 25:55.534
Please take care of Audrey.

25:55.600 --> 25:58.000
And thank you.

25:58.501 --> 26:00.802
You've been a good friend

26:19.133 --> 26:21.133
All right, Marcy. I'll talk
to you in the morning.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.400
Yeah.

26:25.901 --> 26:26.834
You have a second?

26:26.901 --> 26:27.867
What is it, Morris?

26:32.567 --> 26:34.801
I'd like to request a transfer.

26:34.867 --> 26:36.167
Why?

26:36.233 --> 26:38.434
I need to get out of Comm.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.701
You want to
elaborate on that?

26:40.767 --> 26:41.934
Not really, no.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.667
You and Chloe having problems?

26:44.734 --> 26:47.567
You could say that, yes.

26:47.634 --> 26:50.367
I really hate
to lose you in Comm.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.034
Can we talk about
this in the morning?

26:52.100 --> 26:53.100
Nothing's gonna change.

26:53.167 --> 26:55.001
You don't
know that, Miles.
I do.

26:55.068 --> 26:56.901
Look. Please.

26:56.968 --> 26:58.834
Figure out where
you want to put me.

26:58.901 --> 27:00.133
Anywhere is fine.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.068
Just get me
out of Comm.

27:04.601 --> 27:06.634
All right.

27:06.701 --> 27:08.133
We'll work
something out

27:08.200 --> 27:12.001
that, uh, that's good
for everyone involved.

27:13.034 --> 27:14.167
Thank you.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.034
(phone ringing)

27:21.534 --> 27:22.467
Hi, honey.

27:22.534 --> 27:23.667
Hey.

27:23.734 --> 27:24.701
I have a minute.

27:24.767 --> 27:26.467
Did you want
to talk about something?

27:26.534 --> 27:29.233
Bill,

27:29.300 --> 27:32.167
the DOJ investigator
found out about Seattle,

27:32.233 --> 27:34.200
when you and Homeland
had Fayed in custody.

27:34.267 --> 27:35.200
"Found out"?

27:35.267 --> 27:36.767
It wasn't a secret.

27:36.834 --> 27:38.034
We did everything by the book.

27:38.100 --> 27:39.133
I can deal with DOJ.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.367
Yeah, I know, but...

27:41.434 --> 27:43.467
The problem is, they're
out for blood, Bill.

27:43.534 --> 27:46.701
I can't let
this touch me.

27:46.767 --> 27:48.834
Touch you? What are
you talking about?

27:48.901 --> 27:50.968
Bill, I...
Why is this
suddenly an issue?

27:51.034 --> 27:51.968
Are you concerned

27:52.034 --> 27:53.467
I might implicate you?

27:53.534 --> 27:57.367
No. No, but obviously there's
guilt by association here.

27:57.434 --> 27:59.334
They're looking
for a scapegoat.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.534
Yes. The pundits and
the press are looking

28:01.601 --> 28:03.133
for anything to attack
the administration.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.467
What are you saying?

28:07.734 --> 28:09.567
I have to protect
the White House, Bill.

28:09.634 --> 28:13.167
and in order to do that, I have
to distance myself from you.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.634
How are you going to do that?

28:14.701 --> 28:16.267
I'm your husband.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.500
You asking me to resign?

28:27.400 --> 28:28.601
No, Bill.

28:32.233 --> 28:34.068
I have to fire you.

28:34.133 --> 28:37.034
There's pressure on you, Karen.

28:37.100 --> 28:38.534
Look, this is the only way

28:38.601 --> 28:39.901
this can work.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.701
And it has
to happen immediately.

28:41.767 --> 28:44.500
or I'll be viewed as complicit
and my ability to stay on

28:44.567 --> 28:46.968
as national security advisor
will be undermined.

28:47.034 --> 28:48.701
Undermined?

28:48.767 --> 28:50.400
We're talking about
the end of my career.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.034
You don't think that
I've thought this through?

28:52.100 --> 28:53.334
No, I don't.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.767
You don't think
that I don't know

28:54.834 --> 28:55.801
what this means to you?

28:55.867 --> 28:57.901
No, I don't.
Bill...

28:57.968 --> 28:59.767
Because the public
will make assumptions

28:59.834 --> 29:01.367
that don't exist.

29:01.434 --> 29:03.701
13,000 American lives lost.

29:03.767 --> 29:06.767
I had the man in custody who was
responsible, and I released him.

29:06.834 --> 29:09.034
It won't matter that I had
no evidence to hold him.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.601
Look, you know how this works.

29:10.667 --> 29:13.334
One of us has to take the fall,
and it can't be me.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.001
I'm too close to the president.

29:16.534 --> 29:17.801
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

29:17.867 --> 29:19.334
Who is pressuring you, Karen?

29:19.400 --> 29:20.434
What are you not saying?

29:20.500 --> 29:22.867
You have to trust me
on this, honey.

29:22.934 --> 29:25.467
We will get through
this, I promise.

29:25.534 --> 29:29.068
And... I love you, and that's
all that should matter here.

29:29.133 --> 29:30.300
Is it?

29:30.367 --> 29:31.834
Yes.

29:39.567 --> 29:45.834
(phone ringing)

29:45.901 --> 29:46.867
(hangs up)

29:51.601 --> 29:54.500
Why is it taking so long
with Jack's phone call to Cheng?

29:54.567 --> 29:55.667
It just is, Mike.

29:55.734 --> 29:57.834
He used a double-length
key to slow us down.

29:57.901 --> 29:59.467
We're going as fast as we can.

29:59.534 --> 30:01.367
All right, I'm off the highway.
Mile Marker 19.

30:01.434 --> 30:02.534
Checking surface streets.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.867
(ringing)

30:13.934 --> 30:15.200
Hello, Valley Cab Company.

30:15.267 --> 30:16.200
May I help you?

30:16.267 --> 30:17.267
My name is Jack Bauer.

30:17.334 --> 30:18.534
I'm a counter-terrorist agent.

30:18.601 --> 30:19.701
This is an emergency.

30:22.300 --> 30:23.867
I don't see any sign of Jack.

30:23.934 --> 30:25.068
What's further north of here?

30:25.133 --> 30:27.500
Nothing but national forest
for 32 miles.

30:27.567 --> 30:31.667
He could be in
the Central Valley by now.

30:31.734 --> 30:34.001
Wait. I might
have found something.

30:34.068 --> 30:36.001
I'll get back to you.
Okay.

30:47.933 --> 30:48.866
Nadia.

30:48.933 --> 30:52.466
Has Doyle
found Jack yet?

30:52.533 --> 30:53.766
Well, he might have a lead.

30:53.833 --> 30:55.232
He's checking
it out now.
All right.

30:57.866 --> 30:58.933
Come with me.

31:09.533 --> 31:11.866
I'm stepping down
as director of CTU.

31:11.933 --> 31:13.366
What?

31:14.866 --> 31:15.833
What happened?

31:15.900 --> 31:16.866
All I can say is

31:16.933 --> 31:18.232
I have to step down.

31:18.299 --> 31:20.299
No. Sir, that
doesn't make any sense.

31:20.366 --> 31:21.866
Why would you quit--

31:21.933 --> 31:22.966
now of all days?

31:23.033 --> 31:24.399
I'm not quitting.

31:26.100 --> 31:29.199
I was fired.

31:30.232 --> 31:32.299
By who?

31:32.366 --> 31:33.533
It doesn't matter.

31:33.599 --> 31:34.833
I've contacted Division.

31:34.900 --> 31:37.100
For now, you're acting director.

31:40.866 --> 31:42.167
Mr. Buchanan.

31:42.232 --> 31:45.499
We've been ordered
to escort you off the premises.

31:45.566 --> 31:46.633
I know.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.033
I'm briefing Ms. Yassir.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.866
She's taking over
as head of CTU. We'll need

31:50.933 --> 31:51.866
one more minute, please.

31:51.933 --> 31:52.900
<i>One minute.</i>

31:55.067 --> 31:57.933
Sir, we're in the middle
of 50 different things here.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.599
Why would they do
this to you now?

31:59.666 --> 32:00.866
I can't talk about it.

32:00.933 --> 32:03.499
You need to accept it
and do the best you can.

32:03.566 --> 32:05.733
No. I don't understand
why they would fire you.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.766
You're the most ethical,
dedicated person

32:07.833 --> 32:09.199
I've ever known.

32:09.266 --> 32:11.366
There's no way you did
anything to justify this,

32:13.966 --> 32:16.433
Damn it, Bill, what is going on?

32:18.533 --> 32:20.067
It's just politics.

32:21.499 --> 32:24.466
Division will be sending
over an interim director

32:24.533 --> 32:26.466
in the next few hours.
In the meantime,

32:26.533 --> 32:28.366
you can handle
anything that comes up.

32:28.433 --> 32:30.633
What about the
extra redundancies

32:30.700 --> 32:32.733
and everything else I've
had to go through today?

32:32.800 --> 32:35.232
I'm not the right
choice to take over.

32:35.299 --> 32:37.866
I've lifted all the restrictions
on your security clearance.

32:37.933 --> 32:41.133
You shouldn't have any
trouble running CTU.

32:41.199 --> 32:43.933
<i>You are the right choice.</i>

32:45.700 --> 32:46.966
I don't know what to say.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.199
Just stay on top

32:48.266 --> 32:49.499
of the situation with Jack.

32:49.566 --> 32:51.133
I will.

32:52.399 --> 32:54.566
No one else
knows I'm leaving

32:54.633 --> 32:56.466
You have to inform them
before it's posted

32:56.533 --> 32:57.966
on the internal forums

32:58.033 --> 32:59.866
I'll tell them.

33:08.666 --> 33:11.299
What you said means a lot.

33:18.067 --> 33:20.566
(phone ringing)

33:20.633 --> 33:22.933
O'Brian.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.966
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, got it.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.332
Doyle just called in.

33:28.399 --> 33:29.666
He's found Jack's truck.

33:29.733 --> 33:30.866
Good, Morris.

33:35.199 --> 33:37.700
What's happening
to Buchanan?

33:37.766 --> 33:39.700
He's gone.

33:39.766 --> 33:41.366
What do you
mean, he's gone?

33:43.033 --> 33:44.000
I'm in charge.

33:51.232 --> 33:52.800
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

33:52.866 --> 33:55.633
In a few minutes you're gonna be
getting a bulletin

33:55.700 --> 33:57.633
on your systems.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.167
Bill Buchanan has stepped down,

34:00.232 --> 34:03.133
which means that
until Division

34:03.199 --> 34:07.299
can send over a replacement,
he's named me acting director.

34:07.366 --> 34:10.132
Nothing will change
operationally.

34:10.199 --> 34:12.466
Your objective
remains the same--

34:12.533 --> 34:15.833
Bring in Jack Bauer before
he can hand over the component

34:15.900 --> 34:17.966
to the Chinese.

34:20.299 --> 34:21.632
Thank you.

34:48.699 --> 34:50.734
CTU, this is Doyle.
Do you copy?

34:50.799 --> 34:53.367
Doyle, you're on com.
Go ahead.

34:53.433 --> 34:55.634
Do you have anything
on satellite yet?

34:55.699 --> 34:56.667
MILO:
Spotty.

34:56.734 --> 34:58.233
Well, I found our truck.

34:58.300 --> 35:00.467
Either Jack switched vehicles
or he parked it and he's nearby.

35:00.533 --> 35:03.033
I'm gonna go look
at the buildings.

35:08.133 --> 35:10.166
All right, there's some
infrastructure around

35:10.233 --> 35:11.833
we can check
using thermal. Chloe?

35:11.899 --> 35:13.166
I'm on it.

35:13.233 --> 35:14.600
Hang on. We might
not need it.

35:14.667 --> 35:15.667
What do you mean?

35:15.734 --> 35:17.433
A limo just pulled off
the highway.

35:19.333 --> 35:21.500
Redirect all nearby units
to my current location.

35:21.567 --> 35:22.833
Okay.

35:22.899 --> 35:24.333
Send Alpha and Delta teams
to that location.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.233
Also send Air One, Two
and Three for air support.

35:26.300 --> 35:27.667
All right.

35:44.700 --> 35:47.866
Cheng just left the car.

36:02.533 --> 36:03.899
Far enough.

36:03.966 --> 36:06.267
Mr. Bauer.

36:06.333 --> 36:08.166
Where's Audrey?

36:08.233 --> 36:09.866
She's in the car.

36:11.166 --> 36:13.100
Until I get the component...

36:13.166 --> 36:14.267
Nothing's going
to happen

36:14.333 --> 36:15.400
until I see Audrey.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.200
I want to make sure
she's all right.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.500
(speaks Chinese)

36:24.567 --> 36:27.533
She's coming in now.

36:30.933 --> 36:33.667
Audrey Raines is entering
the premises.

36:33.734 --> 36:36.467
I think I'm gonna need
that backup.

36:36.533 --> 36:38.799
You have the sub circuit board?

36:38.866 --> 36:41.799
You'll get it as soon
as I know she's safe.

36:44.766 --> 36:45.700
(speaks Chinese)

36:54.300 --> 36:56.734
Take the gag
out of her mouth.

36:59.333 --> 37:00.500
Wait!

37:02.000 --> 37:03.933
I'll do it.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.734
(speaks Chinese)

37:32.033 --> 37:34.634
(whispering):
I'm so sorry.

37:34.700 --> 37:37.899
CHENG:
You can continue
this reunion later.

37:39.267 --> 37:41.533
How is this gonna work,
Mr. Bauer?

37:41.600 --> 37:45.066
Audrey walks out
of her alone.

37:45.133 --> 37:47.899
As soon as I see that she gets
down near the bridge

37:47.966 --> 37:50.899
I'll know she's out of
the range of your sniper.

37:50.966 --> 37:53.100
Then I'll give you
the component.

37:53.166 --> 37:54.734
There's at least ten guns.

37:54.799 --> 37:55.966
I need the field teams.

37:56.033 --> 37:57.467
Let's do this.

38:00.667 --> 38:03.000
I want you to walk
past the bridge a hundred yards,

38:03.066 --> 38:06.500
on the right side of the road,
do you understand?

38:06.567 --> 38:09.100
There's a gas station, and
a cab will be waiting for you.

38:09.166 --> 38:11.500
He has instructions
to take you back to CTU.

38:13.899 --> 38:16.267
You need to go.

38:16.333 --> 38:17.667
Go.

38:26.667 --> 38:29.300
All right, this is
going down now, Nadia.

38:29.367 --> 38:30.933
Where are
the field teams?!

38:31.000 --> 38:32.367
They should be there
any minute.

38:32.433 --> 38:34.200
I need to do
something now.

38:34.267 --> 38:35.533
They're releasing Audrey
which means Jack

38:35.600 --> 38:37.100
is about to hand
over the component.

38:37.166 --> 38:39.166
Mike, don't let that happen.

38:44.833 --> 38:46.700
Give me the circuit board
or I'll kill her.

39:01.267 --> 39:02.866
Oh, damn it!

39:16.766 --> 39:18.200
(tires squealing)

39:22.233 --> 39:23.734
Miss Raines,
stay where you are.

39:23.799 --> 39:24.866
Stay down!

39:26.166 --> 39:28.833
(men shouting,
gunfire continues)

39:30.200 --> 39:32.066
(speaks Chinese)

39:37.133 --> 39:39.734
CTU, this is Air One.
Do you copy?
Go ahead.

39:39.799 --> 39:42.166
Cheng and his men have escaped.

39:42.233 --> 39:43.333
They're in three black Hummers

39:43.400 --> 39:44.367
heading north
towards the mountains.

39:44.433 --> 39:46.267
Traveling off road.

39:46.333 --> 39:47.500
Pursue and engage.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.066
We've been hit!

39:55.133 --> 39:57.933
We're going down!
I repeat, we're going down!

39:58.000 --> 40:00.766
(engine sputtering)

40:15.734 --> 40:17.799
* *

40:47.166 --> 40:50.433
Agent Bauer, get down!
My weapon is down!

40:50.500 --> 40:52.467
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

40:52.533 --> 40:54.567
Who is your commanding officer?!

40:54.634 --> 40:55.966
I am, Jack.

40:56.033 --> 40:58.734
Stand him up.

40:58.799 --> 41:00.966
Where's the sub-circuit board?
Cheng's got it.

41:01.033 --> 41:03.400
I was set to blow the building
and destroy the component

41:03.467 --> 41:05.799
until you engaged us
in a firefight.

41:05.866 --> 41:06.933
Here's the detonator.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.600
What's the problem?

41:11.667 --> 41:13.066
We don't have Cheng, Jack.

41:13.133 --> 41:15.066
What do you mean,
you don't have him?

41:15.133 --> 41:16.367
The assault teams didn't have
time to get into place.

41:16.433 --> 41:17.400
We had to make
a frontal assault.

41:17.467 --> 41:19.100
He must have escaped
out the rear.

41:19.166 --> 41:20.300
Nadia, did you get that?

41:20.367 --> 41:22.000
Cheng escaped with
the sub-circuit board.

41:22.066 --> 41:23.533
We got a chopper down.

41:23.600 --> 41:24.899
We need those
other choppers ASAP.

41:24.966 --> 41:27.200
I know. The chopper should be
there in five minutes.

41:27.267 --> 41:28.400
Listen, before they went down,

41:28.467 --> 41:30.066
they reported seeing Cheng
and his men

41:30.133 --> 41:31.433
traveling in three
black Hummers

41:31.500 --> 41:34.267
in the mountains
off road traveling north.

41:34.333 --> 41:35.433
Copy that.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.533
Now place Jack under arrest.

41:37.600 --> 41:38.700
Understood.

41:43.267 --> 41:44.200
Is he gone?

41:44.267 --> 41:45.799
Yeah.

41:45.866 --> 41:47.600
I gotta take you
into custody, Jack.

41:47.667 --> 41:48.966
I had this handled.

41:49.033 --> 41:51.233
Why the hell didn't you
listen to me?

41:59.133 --> 42:00.467
Audrey, it's over.

42:00.533 --> 42:01.600
It's all right.
You're safe.

42:01.667 --> 42:03.000
Help me, Jack.

42:03.066 --> 42:04.833
Please don't let them
do this to me.
Audrey...

42:04.899 --> 42:07.667
Help me, Jack, don't
let them do...
Audrey!

42:07.734 --> 42:10.367
It's me. I'm right here.

42:15.567 --> 42:18.799
Do you even know who I am?

42:18.866 --> 42:20.267
DOYLE:
Sit her down.

42:22.066 --> 42:23.634
They've done something to her.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.200
You got to help her, please.

42:25.267 --> 42:26.766
We will. Let's go, Jack.

42:26.833 --> 42:28.100
Please.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.433
(indistinct muttering)

42:37.500 --> 42:39.567
My God.
