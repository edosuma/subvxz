WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.500
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:10.458 --> 00:12.791
Come on!

00:13.416 --> 00:14.250
One.

00:15.708 --> 00:16.541
Two.

00:17.333 --> 00:18.166
Three.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.000
Four.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.625
Now change, look at me.

00:21.708 --> 00:22.666
One.

00:23.583 --> 00:24.541
Two.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.583
Three.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.500
Four. Come on, ladies!

00:29.583 --> 00:31.208
Now turn. One.

00:32.875 --> 00:33.916
And two.

00:34.875 --> 00:35.750
Three.

00:36.583 --> 00:37.750
Four.

00:37.833 --> 00:39.166
Turn and look at me.

00:40.416 --> 00:41.500
From the top.

00:41.583 --> 00:42.500
One.

00:42.583 --> 00:44.250
Two. Three.

00:44.833 --> 00:45.666
Four.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.583
I want to see the water boil, ladies!

00:48.666 --> 00:49.875
Come on.

00:49.958 --> 00:51.375
Come on, from the top.

00:51.458 --> 00:52.333
Go, Alice!

00:52.416 --> 00:53.250
One!

00:53.333 --> 00:55.166
-How was that?
-Great.

00:55.666 --> 00:57.375
-Bye.
-See you next week.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.916
Did you send me my horoscope today?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.458
Yes, but don't read it
or you'll start crying.

01:02.541 --> 01:04.916
But you didn't do mine, though.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.708
Luisa, this is classic Capricorn attitude.

01:07.791 --> 01:08.916
I'm a Taurus.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.083
Sure you are!

01:10.625 --> 01:11.583
Bye.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.666
Are you still alive? Come up.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.875
I like you better as an actor.

01:21.750 --> 01:25.250
Those women should take
an anti-doping test.

01:26.083 --> 01:27.333
Either they're on drugs

01:27.833 --> 01:28.750
or this is like

01:29.958 --> 01:31.625
that pool in<i> Cocoon.</i>

01:32.625 --> 01:33.458
Wait.

01:34.958 --> 01:35.875
Next time,

01:36.625 --> 01:37.833
turn your phone off.

01:38.500 --> 01:44.708
AN ASTROLOGICAL GUIDE FOR BROKEN HEARTS

01:44.958 --> 01:48.500
TAURUS

01:48.583 --> 01:49.583
Look.

01:49.666 --> 01:50.750
HI ALICE, HOW ARE YOU?

01:50.833 --> 01:52.000
FANCY A DRINK?

01:52.083 --> 01:53.250
He texted me again.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.875
But you said
I'm not compatible with Aries.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.500
Thing is, I usually meet men in clubs,

02:02.583 --> 02:03.875
maybe at work.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.875
I never considered astrology as--

02:05.958 --> 02:07.750
I told you how I go about it.

02:07.833 --> 02:08.666
Okay?

02:08.750 --> 02:12.833
Do you really only date people
you're astrologically compatible with?

02:14.125 --> 02:14.958
Does it work?

02:15.833 --> 02:16.666
Can't complain.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.958
But Luca is so into me.

02:20.041 --> 02:20.916
And he's cute.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.000
Of course he's into you.

02:23.083 --> 02:25.458
The less available you are,
the more he wants you.

02:25.958 --> 02:27.333
Typical Aries, in fact.

02:29.666 --> 02:33.541
Your two signs are
at the opposite ends of the zodiac.

02:33.625 --> 02:36.583
He fires up quickly
and expresses his feelings openly

02:36.666 --> 02:38.791
while you, as a good Libra,

02:38.875 --> 02:42.541
try to balance your needs
with those of other people.

02:43.166 --> 02:45.750
In plain terms, he'll eat you alive.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.083
Come on, not all Aries are the same.

02:49.166 --> 02:51.500
Much like not all Libras are the same.

02:51.583 --> 02:54.666
He might be vegetarian, who knows?

02:55.333 --> 02:56.666
-Hi.
-Hi.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.541
-How are you?
-I'm great, you?

02:58.625 --> 02:59.833
Good, thanks.

02:59.916 --> 03:03.333
Please, semolina. Where can I find it?

03:07.625 --> 03:08.541
Sagittarius.

03:09.166 --> 03:12.125
We're both vivacious
and we like to have fun.

03:14.583 --> 03:15.458
Thanks.

03:17.625 --> 03:18.708
Anyhow.

03:19.375 --> 03:23.000
Of course I don't know you
or this Luca, but…

03:24.125 --> 03:25.041
they know.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.625
They know very well.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.708
GOODNESS IS IN THE STARS

03:39.291 --> 03:41.208
<i>Alright, Alice--</i>

03:41.291 --> 03:43.458
Wow, they're really good.

03:43.541 --> 03:44.791
<i>I'm sure.</i>

03:44.875 --> 03:47.916
But I doubt that cookies,
as delicious as they may be,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.916
are also a means of finding
the truth about people.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.791
It's not a joke, Paola.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.416
I know your new astrologist friend
is charming,

03:56.458 --> 03:57.958
but you're taking it too far.

03:58.041 --> 03:59.291
<i>Call Luca.</i>

03:59.791 --> 04:01.333
<i>He's a good guy.</i>

04:01.833 --> 04:03.500
<i>And you need to move on.</i>

04:04.083 --> 04:04.916
Okay.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.708
I'll think about it.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.250
What's going on?

04:09.833 --> 04:10.833
Nothing. Why?

04:11.583 --> 04:12.541
<i>Are you at work?</i>

04:13.875 --> 04:16.958
<i>Remember, when you pitch</i>
<i>your ideas to the new boss</i>

04:17.041 --> 04:20.458
keep your head high and your gaze steady.

04:22.041 --> 04:23.833
But these are not my ideas.

04:24.416 --> 04:26.791
I only helped Enrico
with the presentation.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.083
<i>Why are you not pitching your own ideas?</i>

04:29.166 --> 04:31.083
Because that's not my job.

04:32.125 --> 04:34.125
Sardi already looks at me funny.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.958
<i>Just a spoonful.</i>

04:36.041 --> 04:37.375
<i>You'll like it.</i>

04:37.458 --> 04:38.833
No, thanks.

04:38.916 --> 04:41.000
I don't need pet insurance.

04:43.625 --> 04:44.875
Bye.

04:45.458 --> 04:46.291
Bye.

04:48.041 --> 04:48.875
Cristina?

04:49.375 --> 04:50.208
Yes?

04:52.041 --> 04:55.750
I think there's been a misunderstanding
over that text message.

04:56.791 --> 04:58.250
It was odd.

04:58.333 --> 04:59.166
"Shame."

05:01.375 --> 05:04.750
You see, what I meant to text was,

05:04.833 --> 05:06.416
"What a shame

05:06.958 --> 05:08.666
I couldn't celebrate with you."

05:08.750 --> 05:11.166
Then I realized I'd see you the next day.

05:11.250 --> 05:14.500
So I thought I deleted the text,
but clearly I didn't.

05:14.583 --> 05:15.958
Of course.

05:17.375 --> 05:18.208
Exactly.

05:18.291 --> 05:19.125
Alice!

05:19.666 --> 05:21.583
What are you doing? Hurry!

05:22.791 --> 05:24.625
I guess I have to go.

05:28.708 --> 05:31.125
Always chatting to your friends.
We're late.

05:31.208 --> 05:33.833
We're on time.
And Cristina is not my friend.

05:33.916 --> 05:34.916
She should be.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.333
She's the boss's PA. Keep her close.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.583
You should pitch to Sardi on your own.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.166
Why is that?

05:42.916 --> 05:45.750
No, we've worked together
and we're pitching together.

05:45.833 --> 05:46.958
We're a team.

05:47.958 --> 05:50.083
-Not now.
-Sorry, it's important.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.666
-Alice, you can't.
-Sorry.

05:54.125 --> 05:55.291
Hi, Luca.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.416
<i>Hi, Alice.</i>

05:56.500 --> 05:57.750
<i>You never called me.</i>

05:57.833 --> 06:00.708
I know, I've had some crazy days.

06:00.791 --> 06:02.500
<i>So do you fancy a beer?</i>

06:02.583 --> 06:03.625
Of course.

06:03.708 --> 06:05.041
<i>How about tonight?</i>

06:05.125 --> 06:06.541
<i>-What do you say?</i>
-Tonight?

06:07.041 --> 06:07.875
<i>Yes.</i>

06:07.958 --> 06:08.875
Alright.

06:09.458 --> 06:10.916
Tonight works, sure.

06:11.708 --> 06:14.208
<i>I'll pick you up at 7:00, okay?</i>

06:15.500 --> 06:17.333
I'll call you back in half an hour.

06:17.416 --> 06:18.833
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Bye. Sorry.

06:21.583 --> 06:22.708
Okay. Are you ready?

06:23.291 --> 06:24.125
Deep breath.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.916
And the last pitch

06:29.000 --> 06:30.708
is my favorite,

06:30.791 --> 06:31.750
if I may say so.

06:32.375 --> 06:36.291
We think that a classic quiz show
would be able to engage

06:36.375 --> 06:39.458
the share of the audience
that is a bit nostalgic.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.041
What do you think?

06:49.000 --> 06:52.208
Do you have anything to add
to Enrico's sparkling pitch?

06:54.375 --> 06:56.416
Well, I think, more or less…

06:57.541 --> 07:00.541
I mostly just did
the graphics for the presentation.

07:00.625 --> 07:01.500
No, listen.

07:01.583 --> 07:04.333
I can guarantee
that her contribution was essential.

07:04.416 --> 07:05.375
I'd say crucial.

07:08.375 --> 07:09.250
I thought so.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.833
These ideas were presented very well.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.250
Thank you.

07:14.333 --> 07:17.000
I'll review everything tonight
and I'll let you know.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.583
Perfect. Thanks for your time.

07:19.666 --> 07:20.916
-Bye.
-Thanks.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.333
Ms. Bassi.

07:28.958 --> 07:30.291
Forgive my insistence.

07:31.375 --> 07:34.500
But I'd really like to hear
your take on those ideas.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.083
Do you like them?

07:37.708 --> 07:38.541
Well,

07:39.083 --> 07:40.750
I think they're pretty good.

07:42.666 --> 07:44.416
Then we have similar taste.

07:48.166 --> 07:49.375
In terms of cookies.

08:30.791 --> 08:32.041
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

08:33.291 --> 08:34.208
<i>Look at you.</i>

08:35.000 --> 08:37.083
<i>I thought it was worth a try.</i>

08:37.833 --> 08:39.000
He's just so…

08:41.916 --> 08:43.083
Exactly.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.041
<i>What's wrong with that?</i>

08:46.125 --> 08:47.125
Nothing.

08:47.208 --> 08:48.916
I'm just saying

08:49.000 --> 08:51.083
don't build it up too much.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.000
That's all.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.458
What are you making?

08:54.541 --> 08:55.666
<i>Semolina gnocchi.</i>

08:56.333 --> 08:57.500
Let's talk business.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.458
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

08:59.541 --> 09:00.375
This.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.416
<i>With jeans.</i>

09:04.250 --> 09:05.083
Great.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.625
The night will be over before it starts.

09:09.083 --> 09:12.541
Alice, the Aries man is a carnivore,

09:12.625 --> 09:15.375
so you need to be an alluring prey.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.125
I can undo the first button.

09:17.708 --> 09:18.625
My God.

09:18.708 --> 09:19.583
Are you sure?

09:20.416 --> 09:23.083
<i>Please, Alice. The colors are wrong!</i>

09:23.166 --> 09:25.541
He needs a prey that is

09:26.708 --> 09:27.791
flashy

09:27.875 --> 09:29.583
to make other men jealous.

09:30.375 --> 09:31.833
You need something…

09:33.291 --> 09:34.125
red.

09:35.875 --> 09:36.833
<i>Red?</i>

09:37.416 --> 09:39.250
I don't have anything red.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.583
No, wait.

09:41.666 --> 09:43.541
I do have this.

09:43.625 --> 09:47.125
I wore it to Carnival
when I went with Carlo.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.041
Perfect.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.625
-Tiziano!
<i>-Are you kidding?</i>

09:49.708 --> 09:50.958
Grandma?

09:51.041 --> 09:53.250
Who are you talking to?

09:53.333 --> 09:57.666
I'm talking to a friend of mine,
but we're almost done.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.250
-Come here.
-Is it Rosaria?

10:02.250 --> 10:04.125
Yes, it's Rosaria.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.166
<i>Rosa?</i>

10:05.250 --> 10:10.083
<i>Can you please tell your son</i>
<i>to cut his hair?</i>

10:10.166 --> 10:12.000
He's such a hippie.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.083
I'll be right there.

10:18.375 --> 10:19.208
I'm sorry.

10:19.291 --> 10:20.875
<i>She thought you were my mom.</i>

10:21.833 --> 10:23.458
She's getting on in years.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.166
<i>Such a sweetie.</i>

10:27.458 --> 10:28.291
Yes.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.375
I gotta go now.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.625
<i>Be daring. Go and conquer.</i>

10:34.958 --> 10:36.250
<i>Have a fun night.</i>

10:49.375 --> 10:50.708
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:50.791 --> 10:51.833
Wow.

10:51.916 --> 10:53.125
Well, you know.

10:53.208 --> 10:54.333
I'm on my way out.

10:55.416 --> 10:56.625
Who's the lucky guy?

10:56.708 --> 10:58.125
He works with Paola.

10:58.208 --> 11:00.750
A journalist.
It'll be an intellectual evening.

11:00.833 --> 11:01.666
Good choice.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.166
I was just trying it on.

11:11.083 --> 11:12.208
Why are you here?

11:12.291 --> 11:15.375
I know you had a chat with Cristina.

11:18.750 --> 11:19.875
What are you doing?

11:20.458 --> 11:23.708
We didn't get to have a toast
the other night.

11:23.791 --> 11:25.458
I'm going out, Carlo.

11:25.541 --> 11:26.875
Come on, just a glass.

11:26.958 --> 11:28.458
Can we have one glass?

11:31.375 --> 11:32.250
Thank you.

11:36.708 --> 11:37.708
To the future.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.125
<i>To your future.</i>

11:45.375 --> 11:48.583
I thought we could work on our movie.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.708
I got stuck on scene 52.

11:52.791 --> 11:55.750
I really need your magic touch.

11:58.583 --> 11:59.458
Look.

11:59.541 --> 12:00.375
Check this out.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.041
Do you remember your original idea?

12:09.041 --> 12:10.250
Something like this.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.791
Shit, he's here!

12:22.833 --> 12:26.708
Listen, would it bother you
if I worked here?

12:27.250 --> 12:28.458
What do you mean?

12:28.541 --> 12:30.791
It's impossible to work at my house.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.208
Cristina moved in,
and her stuff is everywhere.

12:34.291 --> 12:35.166
It's a mess.

12:35.708 --> 12:38.625
You're getting married,
better get used to it.

12:38.708 --> 12:39.875
Very funny.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.291
You know I need complete silence.

12:42.375 --> 12:45.458
We both know your dates
always end the same way.

12:45.541 --> 12:48.375
Nine times out of ten
you hate the guy and get back early.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.291
After that we can get down to work.

12:50.375 --> 12:51.416
Perfect.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.708
I doubt I'll be home early.

12:59.458 --> 13:00.291
<i>Alright.</i>

13:00.375 --> 13:03.083
<i>Aries or no Aries,</i>
<i>you're not coming back home.</i>

13:04.750 --> 13:05.666
You never know.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.083
Hi.

13:22.583 --> 13:23.916
Sorry I'm late.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.166
No worries.

13:25.791 --> 13:26.625
Please.

13:27.583 --> 13:28.500
Thank you.

13:28.583 --> 13:29.583
<i>Old school.</i>

13:29.666 --> 13:30.791
<i>I like it.</i>

13:40.833 --> 13:41.750
Do you like it?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.125
Excuse me.

13:55.208 --> 13:56.500
Follow me.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.083
Wait, it's best if I sit over there.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.333
You see, there's a draft.

14:08.416 --> 14:11.166
I'd hate for you to catch a cold.

14:12.208 --> 14:13.250
<i>So attentive.</i>

14:17.208 --> 14:18.083
Here you go.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.500
-Thanks.
-What is that?

14:19.583 --> 14:21.333
An Americano, <i>of course</i>.

14:21.916 --> 14:23.125
The best in town.

14:24.291 --> 14:25.791
<i>I'd prefer something else.</i>

14:26.958 --> 14:27.833
Actually.

14:30.541 --> 14:33.125
Sorry, I thought I saw someone I know.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.041
To us.

14:37.125 --> 14:41.458
The point is, there are
so many wonderful places on Earth

14:41.541 --> 14:44.375
that I wouldn't know where to start.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.250
I'd love to retake the Trans-Siberian.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.416
Retake?

14:49.500 --> 14:50.333
Yes.

14:50.416 --> 14:53.291
I went two years ago,
but my ex hated the cold.

14:53.375 --> 14:56.041
She complained about everything.

15:01.833 --> 15:05.750
I think you've already written
your Oscar acceptance speech.

15:05.833 --> 15:06.666
Am I right?

15:07.375 --> 15:08.291
No way.

15:09.291 --> 15:10.541
It's rare

15:10.625 --> 15:14.666
for a production assistant
to win an Oscar.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.250
How about you?

15:19.333 --> 15:20.166
What about me?

15:20.833 --> 15:21.708
What's your…

15:22.250 --> 15:24.666
What do you like most about journalism?

15:25.583 --> 15:29.208
I love unearthing the stories
that people want to hide.

15:30.916 --> 15:32.625
What secrets are you hiding?

15:36.916 --> 15:37.750
Um…

15:39.333 --> 15:40.166
I…

15:41.208 --> 15:42.291
Just a sec.

15:46.291 --> 15:49.166
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE?
I'M STRUGGLING HERE…

15:49.250 --> 15:50.083
<i>Alright.</i>

15:50.583 --> 15:54.375
I'LL BE A WHILE. I LIKE HIM.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.208
Hi.

16:04.208 --> 16:05.083
Should we eat?

16:05.708 --> 16:08.375
One <i>gin tonic</i> and a <i>whiskey sour</i>, please.

16:18.583 --> 16:19.750
What a coincidence.

16:21.916 --> 16:22.833
Hi.

16:22.916 --> 16:25.458
I didn't think you still came here.

16:25.541 --> 16:26.458
Well, I do.

16:29.125 --> 16:29.958
Alice?

16:31.541 --> 16:32.666
This is Anna.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.875
And this is Wolf.

16:41.541 --> 16:43.208
<i>The Trans-Siberian!</i>

16:45.166 --> 16:47.083
Pleased to meet you.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.250
Pleasure is mine.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.416
<i>His ex.</i>

16:51.500 --> 16:53.791
And he took me to their favorite bar.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.416
Their…

16:57.666 --> 16:58.833
table, Tio.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.125
She had it all.

17:01.208 --> 17:02.250
Like…

17:03.000 --> 17:04.541
she was wearing a short dress.

17:05.708 --> 17:06.958
Very leggy.

17:07.958 --> 17:09.083
The dress was red.

17:12.416 --> 17:13.708
What about the shoes?

17:16.583 --> 17:17.708
Wait.

17:18.583 --> 17:21.291
I'll go back and have a look at the shoes.

17:24.125 --> 17:25.333
She's perfect.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.750
Since you know everything,

17:31.375 --> 17:32.791
tell me,

17:32.875 --> 17:35.333
are three mini pizzas

17:35.416 --> 17:40.750
and one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten olives

17:41.458 --> 17:43.041
enough to counteract

17:44.500 --> 17:46.416
Americanos on an empty stomach?

17:51.375 --> 17:53.833
What an idiot, it's a voice message.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.583
Wolf?

18:15.125 --> 18:18.166
Is that on your birth certificate?

18:18.250 --> 18:19.083
No.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.583
My surname is Luporetti.

18:21.666 --> 18:22.625
And so…

18:24.208 --> 18:26.541
<i>You're not going home, Alice.</i>

18:26.625 --> 18:28.458
Have you been dating long?

18:28.541 --> 18:30.833
Nah, first date.

18:30.916 --> 18:31.916
We met on Tinder.

18:33.583 --> 18:34.833
What about you?

18:35.791 --> 18:36.708
Just friends.

18:38.041 --> 18:39.166
Friend of a friend.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.916
He dragged you into an awkward night.

18:43.833 --> 18:44.958
Definitely.

18:49.458 --> 18:50.333
No.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.041
No, thanks. My head is already spinning.

18:53.125 --> 18:56.000
It helps, you know.
Your head will spin the opposite way.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.875
<i>You're not going home.</i>

19:06.708 --> 19:09.541
What sign are you, Wolf?

19:11.000 --> 19:11.916
Taurus.

19:12.458 --> 19:13.375
Taurus.

19:15.208 --> 19:18.500
Only if you've had a terrible accident

19:18.583 --> 19:21.208
that left you paralyzed,

19:21.291 --> 19:22.416
unable to speak,

19:22.916 --> 19:23.916
to think,

19:24.666 --> 19:26.625
or even to decide

19:26.708 --> 19:30.333
whether to breathe
through your nose or your mouth,

19:30.958 --> 19:32.083
only

19:32.166 --> 19:36.833
in this case,
when your life is hanging by a thread,

19:36.916 --> 19:38.708
a Taurus man is right for you.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.625
When a Taurus man speaks,

19:42.666 --> 19:44.083
he's made up his mind.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.416
And nothing,

19:45.500 --> 19:46.333
nothing

19:47.208 --> 19:49.666
will stop him
from going through with his plans.

19:51.041 --> 19:53.791
Not even your precious opinion.

19:57.291 --> 20:00.208
Luckily you're not a Scorpio.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.750
You'd be in trouble.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.250
Of course.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.541
Good to know.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.125
A friend told me.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.375
He's a genius.

20:15.250 --> 20:17.125
Do you have a genius friend?

20:17.208 --> 20:18.250
Me? No.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.708
I only have stupid ones.

20:21.416 --> 20:23.000
LOVING THE DIFFERENCES

20:23.083 --> 20:24.166
Hey.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.750
More questions about <i>toreras</i>?

20:28.833 --> 20:29.708
Hey.

20:30.916 --> 20:32.500
I work here.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.416
And I live here.

20:38.000 --> 20:38.875
Up there.

20:41.041 --> 20:41.875
No way.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.333
What a coincidence.

20:59.666 --> 21:00.625
Davide!

21:03.541 --> 21:05.000
Alice. Do you know him?

21:06.166 --> 21:07.250
What are you doing?

21:07.333 --> 21:08.333
Davide.

21:09.416 --> 21:11.041
This is Wolf.

21:12.166 --> 21:14.125
He lives right

21:15.166 --> 21:16.416
over there.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.000
She's had a bit to drink.

21:18.583 --> 21:19.625
She'll be fine.

21:21.041 --> 21:22.291
Are you alright?

21:22.375 --> 21:23.208
I'm alright.

21:24.125 --> 21:24.958
Okay.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.083
Davide.

21:33.750 --> 21:34.708
I…

21:34.791 --> 21:36.583
Would you give me a ride home?

21:40.041 --> 21:40.875
Sure.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.125
Bye, Alice.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.708
Is your head spinning?

21:59.791 --> 22:00.708
A lot.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.166
Hold on.

22:03.083 --> 22:05.208
Do you always work this late?

22:05.291 --> 22:06.916
Here, have some water.

22:16.083 --> 22:16.916
Wait.

22:20.708 --> 22:21.625
Well done, Alice.

22:22.333 --> 22:23.583
This is how it's done.

22:24.208 --> 22:25.041
What was that?

22:25.708 --> 22:26.541
<i>Fuck.</i>

22:31.791 --> 22:33.125
Drink slowly.

22:34.291 --> 22:35.291
I mean it.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.833
Small sips, or you'll feel worse.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.083
I'm okay.

22:41.625 --> 22:44.958
I think I can make
the best decisions for myself.

22:47.375 --> 22:48.625
Alright, no, I can't.

22:49.958 --> 22:51.208
Not at all.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.458
Not on my own.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Who with then?

23:01.291 --> 23:04.375
Right. We shouldn't underestimate
the wisdom of pretty lights.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.208
The stars.

23:08.791 --> 23:11.916
I think we should all let ourselves
be guided by them.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.083
Just like sailors.

23:15.958 --> 23:16.875
And Tio.

23:17.791 --> 23:18.625
Who?

23:20.166 --> 23:24.041
Had I listened to him,
I wouldn't have ended up in this mess.

23:24.625 --> 23:26.250
What mess are you in?

23:27.083 --> 23:27.916
Well.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.958
I am drunk,

23:30.916 --> 23:33.250
sitting on the steps at night with you.

23:34.583 --> 23:35.666
My new boss.

23:37.916 --> 23:38.750
I see.

23:40.500 --> 23:43.166
Would you rather be with Wolf?

23:47.625 --> 23:50.083
You must think I'm a terrible person.

23:50.791 --> 23:51.625
Why would I?

23:51.708 --> 23:55.625
Because I've made a fool of myself
every time we've met.

23:59.458 --> 24:00.291
No.

24:01.916 --> 24:03.041
You're not a fool.

24:07.458 --> 24:09.666
What sign are you, Davide Sardi?

24:12.333 --> 24:14.375
-Come on.
-Let's go home.

24:15.375 --> 24:17.000
No, I'm not going home.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.291
I'll call a friend.

24:26.375 --> 24:27.208
Here.

24:47.250 --> 24:50.541
I've never seen my city from a motorcycle.

25:04.666 --> 25:06.291
It's amazing!

25:11.208 --> 25:14.083
Imagine how much the stars have seen.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.375
You see?

25:17.458 --> 25:19.708
I always come up with the weirdest ideas.

25:20.666 --> 25:21.666
Don't you think?

25:22.625 --> 25:26.041
It's like a show about astrology.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.041
I can see it.

25:27.625 --> 25:29.125
Twelve contestants.

25:29.625 --> 25:32.208
One for each sign.

25:32.291 --> 25:35.125
And a lonely heart

25:35.625 --> 25:37.541
looking for love.

25:38.333 --> 25:41.583
But they are not really lonely,

25:41.666 --> 25:43.291
because Tio helps them out.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.208
Tio can read the stars

25:47.125 --> 25:50.583
so the singles can pick the right partner.

25:55.500 --> 25:59.583
A show like that
would've saved me so much trouble.

26:27.583 --> 26:28.416
Alice?

26:29.791 --> 26:30.625
We're here.

26:35.083 --> 26:35.916
Easy.

26:47.375 --> 26:51.458
The only good thing I've done tonight
is forcing you to call me Alice.

26:52.041 --> 26:53.291
I like it too.

27:00.875 --> 27:03.833
Just so you know,
this is the worst version of me.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.375
Carlo is moving on.

27:09.791 --> 27:11.000
Paola has her son.

27:13.875 --> 27:17.166
Even my parents have busy lives.

27:19.833 --> 27:21.500
And I…

27:22.708 --> 27:24.291
I had my chance.

27:27.125 --> 27:28.250
And I wasted it.

27:36.708 --> 27:39.500
And the worst thing is
that it was all my fault.

28:19.416 --> 28:20.250
Peeka…

28:20.875 --> 28:21.708
boo!

28:25.666 --> 28:27.916
Did you wake up Auntie?

28:30.250 --> 28:31.208
Poor Auntie.

28:31.291 --> 28:35.083
Now we can go to her and say,
"Sorry for waking you up."

28:35.166 --> 28:36.250
Sorry.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.166
Don't worry about it.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.875
Coffee is brewing.

28:39.958 --> 28:42.375
I made the big moka pot.

28:42.458 --> 28:43.750
Wise move.

28:44.875 --> 28:46.500
This new thing you're doing,

28:46.583 --> 28:50.458
getting drunk every time
a guy lets you down, we end it now.

28:50.541 --> 28:51.375
Right?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.791
Giovanni hates me, doesn't he?

28:54.875 --> 28:55.833
A little bit.

28:57.041 --> 28:59.000
But I said it was partly my fault.

29:00.166 --> 29:01.916
I swear that at work

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Luca is just so nice.

29:04.875 --> 29:06.416
What an asshole.

29:08.375 --> 29:09.916
It's not a joke.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.166
Auntie screwed up her job, you know?

29:13.250 --> 29:14.541
Don't be a drama queen.

29:14.625 --> 29:17.916
Your boss seemed really nice. And also…

29:18.750 --> 29:20.208
extremely hot.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.916
I was about to tell him.

29:30.875 --> 29:31.916
I…

29:32.583 --> 29:36.625
I was completely drunk.
I started talking about Carlo.

29:40.625 --> 29:42.041
And we were almost…

29:44.833 --> 29:45.666
And then what?

29:47.125 --> 29:49.083
Then I threw up on him.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.958
I am such a piece of shit.

30:41.708 --> 30:42.708
There you are!

30:44.291 --> 30:45.500
What have you done?

30:48.750 --> 30:50.125
Ah, I see.

30:51.041 --> 30:52.583
But there's no time to recover.

30:52.666 --> 30:54.916
Bodrato is waiting for you
in Sardi's office.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.750
Cristina.

31:03.333 --> 31:04.166
Yes?

31:04.666 --> 31:06.416
Do you know why he wants to see me?

31:06.500 --> 31:08.291
No, but Sardi is in there too.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.833
No, Cristina. Wait.

31:13.666 --> 31:15.000
May I ask you a favor?

31:16.916 --> 31:17.833
Last night,

31:18.791 --> 31:20.250
I really screwed up

31:20.333 --> 31:21.333
with Sardi.

31:21.833 --> 31:24.791
Could you put in a good word for me
with Bodrato?

31:25.416 --> 31:29.750
Did you screw up before or after
my fiancé came to your house?

31:30.625 --> 31:31.541
After.

31:32.541 --> 31:33.416
No, I mean…

31:34.041 --> 31:37.416
Carlo came to work,
and I left right after so…

31:37.500 --> 31:38.833
I know, he told me.

31:40.666 --> 31:41.541
What a <i>shame</i>

31:42.208 --> 31:43.291
for you.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.791
I can't help you.

32:05.416 --> 32:06.750
Please, come in.

32:11.125 --> 32:13.083
Ms. Bassi, at last.

32:13.166 --> 32:15.125
I do apologize for the delay.

32:15.208 --> 32:16.333
Oh, I know.

32:17.041 --> 32:19.208
Davide told me about last night.

32:19.750 --> 32:22.333
It sounds like it was quite a night

32:23.250 --> 32:24.333
to remember.

32:24.416 --> 32:26.625
I'm so sorry, I had such a bad time.

32:26.708 --> 32:27.916
And I lost control.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.958
I promise it won't happen again.

32:30.041 --> 32:32.583
What Mr. Bodrato is saying

32:32.666 --> 32:36.000
is that he loves
the idea you told me about last night.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.333
Me?

32:40.833 --> 32:44.958
Yes, the game show
about love and astrology.

32:49.791 --> 32:51.916
Of course, it's just an idea.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.500
However, Ms. Bassi, Davide is confident

32:55.583 --> 32:59.166
that you will be able to develop it,
thinking outside the box.

32:59.250 --> 33:02.708
And that you'll know how to make it work.

33:02.791 --> 33:03.875
Don't you agree?

33:07.041 --> 33:08.000
Don't disappoint him.

35:55.583 --> 36:00.583
