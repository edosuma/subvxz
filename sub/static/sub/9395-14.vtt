01:50.654 --> 01:52.449
We are losing him. We got a code blue.

01:55.579 --> 01:56.827
Charge the paddles to 200.

01:56.930 --> 01:57.938
Charging

02:04.629 --> 02:05.421
Clear.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.733
Charge the paddles to 300. Clear.

02:19.841 --> 02:21.050
He’s a go.

02:21.905 --> 02:23.238
Okay, lets go in.

02:35.351 --> 02:36.544
How long will this take?

02:36.656 --> 02:38.870
We’re just about done here now.

02:39.488 --> 02:42.016
I don’t mean me, I’m talking about my nephew, Lucas.

02:42.253 --> 02:43.574
How long will he be in surgery?

02:43.825 --> 02:46.062
Well, it depends on how serious his injuries are.

02:57.063 --> 02:59.006
I’m sorry, what did you just say?

02:59.564 --> 03:00.450
About what?

03:00.608 --> 03:02.033
About the way that we started.

03:03.189 --> 03:06.062
Nothing. Just when I first came to you for tutoring,

03:06.477 --> 03:10.209
I figured the easiest way to mess with Lucas was to hook up with you, but…

03:10.311 --> 03:12.553
So everything between us has been a lie?

03:12.795 --> 03:14.048
No, that’s not.

03:14.141 --> 03:16.761
I cannot believe this, Lucas was right about you all along.

03:17.577 --> 03:22.466
Haley, pick up. There’s been an accident. Lucas is hurt pretty bad.

03:23.100 --> 03:23.895
Haley?

03:24.340 --> 03:25.185
Keith, hey.

03:27.279 --> 03:28.794
He’s going to make it, right?

03:30.817 --> 03:32.071
Okay, thanks.

03:32.603 --> 03:35.076
- Come on, I’ll take you to the hospital.
- I can’t talk to you right now, Nathan.

03:35.138 --> 03:37.191
Haley, look I’m sorry I didn’t mean it like that.

03:37.253 --> 03:38.215
Just go.

03:39.071 --> 03:39.915
Just go.

03:46.321 --> 03:49.418
Hey, you know you can tell me anything, what is it?

03:49.525 --> 03:50.667
It’s just…

03:52.510 --> 03:54.031
There’s something you should know.

03:57.896 --> 04:00.226
Hello? Haley, what’s wrong?

04:06.652 --> 04:07.732
Peyton, what?

04:12.729 --> 04:13.564
Lucas.

04:14.752 --> 04:15.868
There’s been an accident.

04:17.137 --> 04:18.161
You should go to him.

04:20.911 --> 04:21.628
Keith.

04:23.190 --> 04:25.198
I’m so glad you’re okay.

04:25.714 --> 04:28.233
- Where is he?
- I’m so sorry. I didn’t see the other car.

04:28.279 --> 04:30.301
Where’s the operating room? I need someone to tell me what’s happening.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.182
They asked us to wait here and they’re going to let us know when he’s in recovery.

04:34.283 --> 04:37.562
I couldn’t get a cab and then the only thing I had to pay with was Euros.

04:38.079 --> 04:39.922
He’s got to be alright, Keith.

04:40.546 --> 04:41.898
I wont’ lose him.

04:42.180 --> 04:42.967
I know.

04:43.218 --> 04:43.946
I can’t.

04:45.027 --> 04:46.260
Excuse me, Doctor.

04:49.374 --> 04:51.309
Were you in the operating room with Lucas Scott?

04:51.462 --> 04:53.346
He was in a car accident. He’s my son.

04:53.546 --> 04:57.648
Dr. Hill is an excellent surgeon. The kid’s lucky his father got him here so fast.

04:57.781 --> 04:58.616
His uncle.

04:59.046 --> 05:02.092
No, his father. He may have saved your sons life.

05:04.385 --> 05:07.032
Um, Dan saw the accident.

05:07.197 --> 05:11.989
He pulled Lucas out of the car, and he drove us here.

05:12.142 --> 05:12.767
Dan?

05:13.433 --> 05:17.968
Yeah, he knew Lucas was in bad shape so he couldn’t wait.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.502
And Dan gave the surgeon permission to operate.

05:21.867 --> 05:22.945
How could he?

05:23.882 --> 05:25.465
He said he was Lucas’ father.

05:26.464 --> 05:28.947
Keith. Keith, is he okay?

05:29.053 --> 05:30.514
Oh honey, we don’t know yet.

05:30.651 --> 05:33.892
I was supposed to see him tonight. He was supposed to come over after the airport and…

05:34.471 --> 05:37.657
- Karen, this is Brooke.
- I’m Brooke, Lucas’ girlfriend. Hi.

05:37.841 --> 05:39.059
Who’s here for Lucas Scott?

05:40.195 --> 05:43.975
- I’m his mother. Is my son okay?
- He’s stable and in recovery.

05:44.543 --> 05:46.207
- Could you just, give us a second?
- Yeah.

05:46.646 --> 05:50.369
He needed a lot of work. His right lung collapsed and had to be repaired.

05:50.456 --> 05:53.861
I had to remove his spleen but there shouldn’t be any long term repercussions.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.259
So you’re saying he’s going to be fine?

05:55.740 --> 05:57.732
He’ll need physical therapy to his shoulder.

05:57.819 --> 06:00.609
It separated in the crash but we were able to reset it.

06:00.952 --> 06:03.451
Other than that he has a concussion and some bruising.

06:03.877 --> 06:06.273
But there was a complication during surgery.

06:06.869 --> 06:07.684
What?

06:07.818 --> 06:11.515
Your son lost a lot of blood. Which caused his heart rate to drop.

06:11.751 --> 06:15.729
We lost him for a few seconds. But as I said he’s stable now.

06:15.841 --> 06:19.354
And all of his vitals look good. So we just have to wait for him to wake up.

06:19.768 --> 06:21.402
When will that be?

06:21.489 --> 06:24.751
Could be a couple of hours, could be a couple of days. That’s up to him.

06:27.005 --> 06:28.995
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome.

06:33.998 --> 06:35.451
I’m so sorry.

06:42.742 --> 06:43.474
Hey.

06:44.763 --> 06:45.921
I thought you’d be at the hospital.

06:46.427 --> 06:47.320
Why aren’t you there?

06:48.543 --> 06:53.734
I dropped Brooke off. It’s just kind of weird, she’s still with Lucas.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.875
She doesn’t know about you guys yet?

06:57.068 --> 06:58.476
We were going to tell her tonight.

07:01.323 --> 07:02.434
Don’t you want to see him?

07:03.105 --> 07:05.787
Yeah I do. I just can’t.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.364
Why not?

07:08.848 --> 07:11.465
If you don’t mind I’d really like to be alone right now.

07:12.879 --> 07:14.752
Yeah. Yeah okay.

07:15.633 --> 07:17.741
But I’m sure his mom would really like to see you.

07:17.842 --> 07:20.518
Peyton, I’ll go when I’m ready.

07:21.370 --> 07:22.157
Sure.

07:28.090 --> 07:32.873
They took my son out of recovery. The nurse had me fill out these insurance forms.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.602
- What’s your sons name?
- Lucas Scott.

07:36.174 --> 07:39.308
- Scott, from the car accident?
- Yeah.

07:40.164 --> 07:44.976
I need to get a statement from that driver, Keith Scott.

07:45.898 --> 07:46.979
He’s a lucky guy.

07:47.881 --> 07:49.702
Yeah, a couple of stitches.

07:49.994 --> 07:52.396
Well, that’s not exactly what I meant.

07:53.050 --> 07:56.901
See your husbands blood alcohol level was just shy the legal limit.

07:57.687 --> 08:00.382
Another hundredth of a point, he’d be in big trouble right now.

08:23.602 --> 08:25.681
I’ll never forgive myself if he’s not okay.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.866
Were you drinking tonight?

08:36.822 --> 08:38.149
- Karen…
- Were you?

08:42.554 --> 08:43.712
I wasn’t drunk.

08:45.393 --> 08:46.974
That’s not what I asked you.

08:48.679 --> 08:50.800
Were you drinking before you drove Lucas?

08:53.908 --> 08:56.084
- Yes, but…
- I trusted you.

09:00.988 --> 09:02.637
I want you to leave.

09:29.243 --> 09:31.469
- Haley, what are you doing?
- Inventory.

09:32.437 --> 09:35.259
Lucas is lying in a hospital, why can’t you just go see him?

09:35.316 --> 09:37.301
Because he wouldn’t want to see me.

09:37.665 --> 09:39.400
What are you talking about? You guys are best friends.

09:39.493 --> 09:40.803
Not last night we weren’t.

09:41.879 --> 09:44.920
- We got into a fight.
- About what?

09:45.852 --> 09:48.760
You, him and Brooke.

09:50.777 --> 09:53.819
The last thing I said to him was “I don’t like the person you’re becoming”

09:53.957 --> 09:56.333
and “The next time we see each other don’t talk to me”.

09:57.168 --> 09:58.121
You didn’t mean it.

09:58.473 --> 10:02.681
Peyton, what if I can’t take it back? What if he doesn’t forgive me.

10:02.733 --> 10:05.329
He will but you just need to see him.

10:07.807 --> 10:12.441
I’ll tell you what. Whenever you decide that you’re ready, I’ll go to the hospital with you.

10:14.412 --> 10:15.671
Strength in numbers.

10:16.829 --> 10:19.368
Yeah, yeah okay, thank you.

10:20.776 --> 10:21.616
I’ll see you.

10:33.158 --> 10:34.006
Hi.

10:35.557 --> 10:38.173
Nathan told me about Lucas. I’m so sorry.

10:39.193 --> 10:40.002
How is he?

10:40.462 --> 10:44.493
He’s still unconscious. But the doctors say his vital signs are strong.

10:45.071 --> 10:46.253
Oh, that’s good news.

10:47.641 --> 10:50.571
I figured you hadn’t had a chance to grab any food.

10:51.434 --> 10:53.572
I’m really not that hungry.

10:54.921 --> 10:58.541
Well, at least have some decent coffee.

11:01.567 --> 11:05.556
I don’t want you to worry about anything other than Lucas.

11:05.847 --> 11:08.219
I’ll take care of the café as long as you need.

11:09.841 --> 11:12.261
Thanks, Deb. I appreciate that.

11:13.003 --> 11:13.702
Here you go.

11:16.547 --> 11:23.000
All night I sat up watching Lucas. And I kept thinking I’m the one who can’t wake up.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.288
This has to be some sort of dream.

11:26.805 --> 11:29.630
Cause if this isn’t a dream it’s got to be some sort of punishment.

11:30.931 --> 11:32.411
Punishment for what?

11:33.122 --> 11:36.772
For being selfish. I mean, if I hadn’t gone to Italy, this wouldn’t have happened.

11:37.382 --> 11:40.745
You can’t think that way. This is not your fault.

11:42.291 --> 11:46.977
And if you had told me yesterday that the Scott brother that I would feel grateful to

11:47.033 --> 11:49.153
is Dan I would have said you were crazy.

11:50.397 --> 11:51.431
What do you mean?

11:52.609 --> 11:53.712
He didn’t tell you?

11:54.217 --> 11:55.062
Tell me what?

11:57.028 --> 11:59.241
Dan brought Lucas to the hospital.

12:00.003 --> 12:02.374
If it wasn’t for him, Lucas wouldn’t have made it.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.513
Hey, it’s me.

12:20.770 --> 12:21.813
Can you hear me?

12:27.068 --> 12:29.135
Squeeze my hand if you can hear me, okay?

12:32.576 --> 12:33.411
Never mind.

12:34.706 --> 12:39.278
Um, I just came by to tell you that I’m probably not going to be around very much.

12:39.831 --> 12:41.930
With Brooke here it’s just kind of weird.

12:43.779 --> 12:46.087
But I’m with you Lucas, you know that.

12:47.885 --> 12:50.056
And I’ll wait forever if I have to.

12:54.352 --> 12:57.382
Oh, I’m sorry. Nobody was here.

12:57.593 --> 13:00.219
You don’t have to go. He’s allowed visitors.

13:00.920 --> 13:01.545
Okay.

13:02.385 --> 13:03.281
I’m Peyton.

13:04.771 --> 13:07.802
I know. Lucas has talked about you.

13:13.276 --> 13:17.644
Its nice that people want to do something but the last thing I can think about right now is food.

13:18.252 --> 13:19.967
You’ll be glad you have it in a couple of days.

13:20.648 --> 13:23.930
I swear the cook at this hospital gets a bonus for making people sick.

13:24.578 --> 13:26.481
Sounds like you’ve spent some time here.

13:27.059 --> 13:29.644
Yeah, when my mom died.

13:31.072 --> 13:31.913
I’m sorry.

13:32.502 --> 13:33.075
No…

13:35.351 --> 13:36.464
How’d she die?

13:38.936 --> 13:40.007
A car accident.

13:44.518 --> 13:46.321
You’re a good friend to visit.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.958
I’ve been expecting Haley to come on by.

13:52.450 --> 13:56.561
She and Lucas got in some argument and she’s really beating herself up over it.

13:58.377 --> 13:59.536
They’ll patch it up.

14:01.306 --> 14:03.314
Best friends can forgive each other anything.

14:07.415 --> 14:08.444
Hey stranger.

14:09.939 --> 14:14.511
Check it out, I dropped so much cash at the gift shop I think they’re going to name it after me.

14:15.127 --> 14:18.562
And I got something for you too Karen.

14:19.279 --> 14:21.264
Nothing makes me feel better when I’m blue than chocolate

14:21.321 --> 14:24.762
and I figured we could be in a better place if we dipped into a sugar coma so...

14:28.121 --> 14:31.781
- I’m sorry, I’m such an idiot I didn’t…
- It’s okay, Brooke.

14:39.772 --> 14:40.982
Hey baby.

14:45.156 --> 14:46.199
How you doing?

14:49.850 --> 14:51.980
Oh, listen, I got to go.

14:54.556 --> 14:58.672
Okay. I’ve got him now but, see you later?

14:59.483 --> 15:01.488
- Sure.
- Okay.

15:03.505 --> 15:05.200
It was really nice to meet you.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.345
You too.

15:20.017 --> 15:22.014
Here you go, enjoy your meal.

15:22.142 --> 15:22.992
How’s Lucas?

15:23.294 --> 15:26.454
- Like you care.
- Haley, come on, that’s not fair.

15:26.812 --> 15:29.024
Look, we’re not tight but I don’t want to see the guy in the hospital.

15:29.090 --> 15:32.279
Why, because if he’s out of circulation than you can’t use me to piss him off?

15:32.495 --> 15:34.895
Hey, would you just stand still for a second so we could talk about this?

15:34.973 --> 15:36.125
Not a chance in hell.

15:36.616 --> 15:39.724
Alright fine, don’t talk to me, but at least let me take you to see Lucas today.

15:39.787 --> 15:42.330
You know what Peyton’s already doing it after my shift and even if she wasn’t

15:42.387 --> 15:43.458
I wouldn’t go with you.

15:47.384 --> 15:49.950
Hey, is she alright?

15:50.128 --> 15:51.584
No, not really.

15:53.538 --> 15:55.858
So this split with you and dad. This is real, huh?

15:56.601 --> 15:58.321
Yeah, honey it is.

15:59.657 --> 16:00.947
How do you feel about that?

16:02.216 --> 16:03.547
Actually I’m fine.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.430
How sad is that?

16:28.308 --> 16:29.238
I can’t.

16:32.245 --> 16:33.245
Haley, wait.

16:36.293 --> 16:38.267
- It’s alright.
- No it’s not.

16:38.324 --> 16:40.787
He’s lying in there and there’s nothing that I can do about it.

16:41.267 --> 16:44.899
Well, you could be there for him. Just go talk to him, you’ll feel better.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.367
I don’t deserve to feel better.

16:46.720 --> 16:50.581
I mean, giving him an apology is not worth anything if he’s awake to hear it.

16:52.384 --> 16:57.052
You know if I go in there I’m just going to start crying and that’s just the last thing Karen needs.

16:58.839 --> 17:00.800
Why don’t you let her be the judge of that?

17:01.932 --> 17:02.720
I cant.

17:12.229 --> 17:13.021
Hi.

17:14.256 --> 17:14.921
Hey.

17:15.571 --> 17:19.586
I just wanted to see how you were doing. I left a couple of messages about Lucas.

17:19.827 --> 17:22.678
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

17:24.066 --> 17:25.664
Is there any change?

17:27.010 --> 17:27.732
No.

17:29.663 --> 17:30.989
Have you talked to Karen today?

17:32.043 --> 17:33.523
She doesn’t want me at the hospital.

17:34.275 --> 17:36.974
I can’t say I blame her.

17:37.245 --> 17:39.324
Well, she’s just in shock right now, Keith.

17:40.126 --> 17:43.041
Once Lucas gets better things will go back to normal.

17:43.445 --> 17:45.335
I’m not so sure about that, Deb.

17:45.881 --> 17:49.579
Karen isn’t speaking to me, Lucas is unconscious and I’m to blame.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.707
That’s a tough one to bounce back from.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.954
Just give it some time.

17:59.979 --> 18:04.386
It’s funny, you know. I wasted all those years being too afraid to tell Karen how I felt.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.755
And then she kissed me at the airport

18:09.158 --> 18:13.659
and suddenly, everything I hoped for seemed possible, all I had to do was wait 6 weeks.

18:15.105 --> 18:16.925
Just 6 weeks.

18:19.510 --> 18:21.631
Yesterday should have been the best day of my life.

18:23.177 --> 18:24.308
Now it’s all gone.

18:31.128 --> 18:32.541
You follow astrology?

18:34.279 --> 18:35.137
Not really.

18:35.777 --> 18:39.648
Me neither. It’s actually not as accurate as numerology.

18:43.355 --> 18:45.019
You two been dating a long time?

18:45.889 --> 18:47.329
A little over a month now.

18:48.818 --> 18:51.839
Ms. Roe? I’m Amy Quinn from the billing department.

18:51.906 --> 18:53.723
I had a couple of questions about your insurance.

18:53.928 --> 18:54.880
Sure, come in.

18:55.285 --> 18:57.871
I’ll just go do something.

18:59.850 --> 19:03.062
I was wondering if you had any supplemental insurance?

19:03.999 --> 19:06.744
No, just the regular hospitalization, why?

19:07.459 --> 19:12.544
Well, the care your son needs will almost certainly cost more than your coverage maximums.

19:13.128 --> 19:18.049
Oh wow. I never figured I’d need more than that.

19:18.626 --> 19:20.568
Expenses do add up these days.

19:22.068 --> 19:24.142
Could we set up some sort of payment plan?

19:24.577 --> 19:27.924
Why don’t you come talk to me after things settle down?

19:28.380 --> 19:30.066
We’ll see what we can figure out.

19:30.680 --> 19:31.837
Thank you.

19:40.736 --> 19:46.547
You never know dear how much I love you,

19:47.253 --> 19:52.440
please don't take my sunshine away.

19:54.437 --> 19:56.271
Open your eyes, Lucas.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.656
Come on, honey.

20:09.137 --> 20:11.897
Is there anything that didn’t change while I was gone?

20:15.859 --> 20:16.970
How’s he doing?

20:17.556 --> 20:18.194
The same.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.099
How about you?

20:20.915 --> 20:21.922
I’m fine.

20:22.833 --> 20:27.032
You got a lot of talents, Karen, but lying is not one of them.

20:35.018 --> 20:38.414
When Lucas was a little boy we used to play this game.

20:39.084 --> 20:40.115
“What would you do”.

20:41.363 --> 20:46.104
What would you do if I blacked out? What would you do if the house caught fire?

20:47.332 --> 20:51.311
I was his only parent I wanted to prepare him if anything happened to me.

20:52.745 --> 20:57.952
But I wasn’t prepared for something happening to him.

21:00.435 --> 21:04.194
- Why don’t you take a break?
- How could Keith be so careless?

21:05.197 --> 21:09.175
I trusted him with the only thing in the world that matters to me.

21:09.534 --> 21:11.607
Lucas matters to Keith too.

21:13.020 --> 21:18.002
Look, Karen, you have every reason to be angry, Lord knows.

21:18.494 --> 21:23.593
But no man ever loved a boy anymore than Keith loves Lucas.

21:25.775 --> 21:27.500
That ought to count for something.

21:37.457 --> 21:39.814
Well, it looks like we all had the same idea, huh?

21:40.735 --> 21:43.248
Better to think of Lucas here than in the hospital, right?

21:43.455 --> 21:44.313
What, you seen him?

21:44.683 --> 21:47.554
Yeah, no change.

21:49.149 --> 21:50.258
This sucks.

21:52.629 --> 21:54.139
Hey Luke, its Mouth.

21:54.805 --> 21:57.897
I just want to say, we’re pulling for you.

21:58.271 --> 22:00.908
Right cause you the dawg. Yep you my dawg.

22:00.995 --> 22:04.711
Hey, don’t think I’m about to spot you any points when you bring your little scrawny ass

22:04.785 --> 22:07.180
back out on this court, man. Ain’t gonna happen.

22:07.859 --> 22:12.075
Yeah, spleen or no spleen, when you bust out, it’s on.

22:12.684 --> 22:15.674
And although the ethics of broadcasting prohibit me from gambling,

22:15.725 --> 22:18.541
I can say unofficially, my money’s on Scott.

22:18.598 --> 22:21.081
What money? You borrowed $10 from me last week.

22:21.154 --> 22:24.639
Hey Luke, Mouth can keep his cash if you come back soon, alright?

22:26.191 --> 22:27.250
Jake, any thoughts?

22:29.929 --> 22:32.749
We need you back man. Simple as that.

22:37.604 --> 22:40.623
What are you doing here? We’re supposed to meet at the mediator’s office.

22:40.686 --> 22:44.177
I know. But I wanted to tell you in person, I’m not going.

22:45.638 --> 22:47.915
We both agreed to mediation.

22:48.146 --> 22:50.102
We also both agreed till death do us part.

22:50.423 --> 22:52.232
You didn’t have any trouble backing out of that one.

22:53.271 --> 22:55.560
Maybe you’re wrong about what’s best for this family too.

22:55.622 --> 22:59.032
What family? We haven’t been one in a long time.

22:59.081 --> 23:00.737
That doesn’t mean we cant be one again.

23:01.304 --> 23:03.557
We chose each other. We built a life together.

23:03.901 --> 23:05.359
Doesn’t that mean anything to you?

23:05.426 --> 23:10.516
Don’t put this on me, Dan. We’ve both made mistakes, it’s time to correct them.

23:10.571 --> 23:12.272
Our marriage was not a mistake.

23:13.189 --> 23:17.463
And Nathan is too important to me to just see him on the weekends. He needs both of us.

23:17.626 --> 23:20.043
Don’t make me hire a lawyer.

23:20.121 --> 23:22.716
I’m asking you not to. And I’m asking you to remember,

23:22.752 --> 23:24.990
when you were the one who needed forgiveness.

23:26.152 --> 23:28.512
When you were the one who almost lost this family.

23:29.470 --> 23:31.149
That was a long time ago.

23:31.661 --> 23:35.195
Exactly. And we made it through that.

23:36.479 --> 23:37.790
And I’m glad we did.

23:38.549 --> 23:39.996
So don’t throw us away.

23:40.985 --> 23:42.526
Give us one more chance.

23:45.440 --> 23:47.697
I’m all out of chances, Dan.

23:49.715 --> 23:52.622
I may not show it in the way you want but this family is my life.

23:53.134 --> 23:56.647
I’m not giving up. I wont agree to a divorce.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.305
Deb said I might find you up here.

24:06.093 --> 24:07.824
- Hey.
- This place is cool.

24:09.222 --> 24:14.825
Yeah, it is. Lucas and I built this, back when it was the two of us against the world.

24:15.796 --> 24:18.545
- Sorry I ran out of the hospital.
- No, don’t sweat it.

24:19.391 --> 24:22.022
I’m probably not the best person to be giving moral support anyway.

24:22.908 --> 24:24.627
Maybe if you went with Nathan.

24:24.695 --> 24:27.331
Nathan and I are taking a little break.

24:27.704 --> 24:30.732
- What happened?
- He was using me to get to Lucas.

24:30.962 --> 24:36.953
Okay, Haley, I don’t believe that. I know Nathan and he’s into you.

24:37.019 --> 24:37.971
It doesn’t matter.

24:41.161 --> 24:44.924
Anyway why do you think that you’re no good for moral support?

24:46.010 --> 24:49.163
You said that you were disappointed in Lucas for betraying Brooke

24:49.400 --> 24:52.875
and I just figured you felt the same way about me.

24:53.941 --> 24:55.230
Actually, no I don’t.

24:56.913 --> 24:59.972
I know what it’s like to need Lucas in your life.

25:01.237 --> 25:04.299
I never let myself need anybody. Ever.

25:05.214 --> 25:06.613
Not since my mom died.

25:07.965 --> 25:12.542
But with Lucas, he looks at me and he really sees me.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.879
You know? Just right down into my soul.

25:18.313 --> 25:21.436
I just want to tell him that I love him and I’m sorry.

25:21.830 --> 25:23.858
I just want to tell him I’m in love with him.

25:29.182 --> 25:29.941
Yeah.

25:32.628 --> 25:34.901
Excuse me, could I drop this off for Lucas Scott?

25:35.069 --> 25:37.359
It’s visiting hours, you could give it to him yourself.

25:38.772 --> 25:40.984
Could you just let him know it’s from Keith Scott?

25:42.468 --> 25:43.139
Thank you.

25:44.537 --> 25:46.913
Oh wait. You’re my sticky note.

25:47.358 --> 25:50.072
Billings got some questions about a payment discrepancy.

25:50.118 --> 25:52.489
They need to talk to Lucas Scott’s mother or father.

25:53.444 --> 25:54.654
That’s you, right?

25:57.994 --> 25:59.718
Which way is the billing department?

26:03.569 --> 26:05.991
That hospital seriously needs a makeover.

26:06.185 --> 26:08.924
You know, it’s not a wonder to me that everyone who’s there is sick.

26:09.559 --> 26:10.300
How’s Lucas?

26:10.954 --> 26:12.568
He’s the same.

26:13.275 --> 26:15.104
Kind of scares me.

26:15.851 --> 26:16.506
Why?

26:17.546 --> 26:20.639
I know what the doctors said, I’m just worried he’s not going to wake up.

26:20.777 --> 26:21.980
Brooke, don’t think that.

26:22.851 --> 26:23.643
I know.

26:25.266 --> 26:27.346
It’s just the thought of losing him now.

26:30.928 --> 26:37.800
Anyway... I was going to go and grab a bite to eat and then go back over there.

26:38.367 --> 26:39.450
You want to go with me?

26:39.920 --> 26:42.874
You know, I cant, right now.

26:43.946 --> 26:44.846
Maybe later?

26:45.983 --> 26:47.601
You’ve been saying that for two days.

26:51.149 --> 26:53.591
Look, I know it’s hard for you.

26:54.323 --> 26:57.708
- You do?
- I know your mom died in that hospital.

27:00.625 --> 27:05.772
Lucas needs his friends right now and even if it’s hard to be around him in that place,

27:06.130 --> 27:07.298
he’s worth the trouble.

27:09.550 --> 27:11.891
Yeah, he is.

27:13.895 --> 27:15.786
I’ll try to come by tomorrow.

27:17.794 --> 27:18.823
You’re the best.

27:21.596 --> 27:22.580
I‘ll see ya.

27:31.336 --> 27:36.789
Let’s see, LeBron James is first among rookies in points and assists per game.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.947
Carmelo Anthony is second.

27:40.393 --> 27:41.768
You a big basketball fan?

27:42.269 --> 27:44.804
It’s important to Lucas so I like to try and keep up.

27:45.003 --> 27:45.987
Yeah, I know what you mean.

27:46.478 --> 27:48.639
I’m suffering through Salinger for him.

27:49.059 --> 27:51.582
Would it kill a guy to read a little Jackie Cohens?

27:52.986 --> 27:54.972
- Did you make that?
- Yeah.

27:57.645 --> 28:01.627
I figured it’d be nice for Lucas to have when he wakes up.

28:04.557 --> 28:06.237
That’s us at a Bear Creek game,

28:06.308 --> 28:10.870
and those are coasters from the place where I kicked his butt playing pool.

28:12.385 --> 28:14.182
Nothing from the tattoo parlor?

28:17.450 --> 28:19.221
Okay, that’s totally on me.

28:19.283 --> 28:23.475
He’s just so serious all the time, you know, I thought a tattoo might lighten him up.

28:23.634 --> 28:25.416
And you couldn’t take him to a comedy?

28:26.174 --> 28:27.945
So you’re not a big tattoo fan.

28:28.724 --> 28:30.438
Not on my son. No.

28:32.788 --> 28:33.746
I’m sorry.

28:35.303 --> 28:36.255
Honestly,

28:38.022 --> 28:41.678
I think I could probably set myself on fire and my mom wouldn’t notice, so...

28:42.214 --> 28:44.370
it’s kind of hard to remember that some moms would.

28:58.460 --> 28:59.535
What is this?

29:00.186 --> 29:03.329
It started last night. People wanted to do something for Lucas.

29:04.441 --> 29:09.275
Is that Tim? He’s always been such an ass to Lucas.

29:09.397 --> 29:11.353
Maybe it’s his way of saying he’s sorry.

29:12.383 --> 29:13.206
Wow.

29:15.731 --> 29:17.944
Why am I not surprised Nathan isn’t here.

29:27.585 --> 29:31.471
Hey, you gotta love watching people make sense out of the way they feel for Lucas.

29:31.787 --> 29:33.538
Yeah, who knew Tim could spell, right?

29:33.747 --> 29:37.485
Yeah right. So how are you doing?

29:38.528 --> 29:39.770
Hanging in I guess.

29:41.531 --> 29:43.727
Hey look I know we don’t really run together but...

29:44.249 --> 29:46.297
if you need someone to talk to, I’m around.

29:46.922 --> 29:47.890
Thanks, Jake.

30:01.068 --> 30:02.493
Your free throws look like crap.

30:03.321 --> 30:05.764
Glad to see you’re picking up the slack in my dad’s absence.

30:05.948 --> 30:06.618
He’s not around?

30:07.583 --> 30:08.718
He moved out.

30:09.757 --> 30:11.048
My parents are getting a divorce.

30:11.863 --> 30:15.273
Oh wow, um. I’m sorry, Nathan, I didn’t know.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.910
It’s alright. They suck together anyways.

30:19.716 --> 30:21.958
Speaking of. What are you doing here?

30:23.673 --> 30:25.675
Haley. Actually.

30:25.820 --> 30:29.122
Um, listen I don’t know what you did to her

30:29.300 --> 30:32.476
but I do know that she’s the best thing that’s ever happened to you.

30:33.504 --> 30:34.960
You including yourself in that?

30:35.948 --> 30:38.122
Yeah, I am.

30:40.856 --> 30:42.172
Well yeah, she is.

30:43.350 --> 30:44.610
She just doesn’t believe me.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.364
So what happened?

30:49.151 --> 30:52.714
I told her that I only went after her at first to screw with Lucas.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.654
You’re a real jackass, you know that?

30:56.698 --> 31:00.866
Yeah, I was. But it hasn’t been about that with me and Haley for a long time.

31:03.511 --> 31:05.427
Nathan, Haley needs your help.

31:06.175 --> 31:07.660
She can’t face Lucas.

31:09.287 --> 31:11.101
That’s not really my place, is it?

31:12.503 --> 31:14.772
I mean, Lucas isn’t exactly my biggest fan.

31:16.308 --> 31:19.903
Doesn’t mean you couldn’t try. For Haley.

31:22.698 --> 31:24.976
So is this advice for me or for you?

31:28.575 --> 31:32.610
Well, this is kind of weird, huh? The two of us talking about each others relationships.

31:33.282 --> 31:35.272
- It’s all weird.
- Yeah.

31:39.778 --> 31:41.590
Thank you for making time to see me

31:41.672 --> 31:43.945
No problem. Sorry you had to wait.

31:44.826 --> 31:47.284
Okay, here’s your receipt.

31:49.410 --> 31:54.012
Um, I’m sorry, I’m a little tired. I don’t understand.

31:54.130 --> 31:59.249
The bill’s been taken care of, if you accrue any other expenses we’ll charge the credit card on file.

31:59.393 --> 32:00.560
What credit card?

32:01.697 --> 32:03.003
Who paid this bill?

32:03.323 --> 32:06.101
Let me just check. Your husband.

32:08.629 --> 32:09.878
Keith Scott.

32:22.608 --> 32:23.805
Are you okay?

32:24.343 --> 32:27.636
Ever since I landed, nothing has been the way I expected it to be.

32:29.709 --> 32:32.172
Including your son’s new girlfriend, right?

32:32.678 --> 32:34.992
That’s not true, I don’t really know you, Brooke.

32:35.187 --> 32:39.344
Look I know I talk a lot when I’m nervous, actually I’m pretty gabby all the time.

32:39.467 --> 32:42.141
But my stupid quotient kind of goes sky high when I’m flipped out

32:42.182 --> 32:45.217
and meeting my boyfriend’s mother in the hospital with all this going on

32:45.270 --> 32:47.936
is pretty much off the stress charts for me. But...

32:49.156 --> 32:51.668
I’m here for you if you need anything.

32:52.866 --> 32:53.763
Thank you.

32:56.430 --> 33:02.503
And, just so you know. The only thing I really want to see is Lucas laugh again.

33:03.542 --> 33:07.620
You know, hear him sing off key and watch him roll his eyes at me

33:07.695 --> 33:09.759
when I steal French fries off his plate.

33:10.112 --> 33:13.276
I guess what I’m trying to say is I’m crazy about your son.

33:13.685 --> 33:15.360
And I hope that’s enough for you.

33:16.225 --> 33:18.830
Actually that’s more than enough.

33:23.704 --> 33:27.202
I figured if I kept bringing food you’re bound to eat sometime.

33:27.259 --> 33:28.836
Oh my God, I’m starving.

33:30.207 --> 33:32.896
But that’s probably not for me.

33:33.433 --> 33:36.895
Example of that stupid quotient thing. Okay, I think I’m just going to go.

33:36.986 --> 33:40.330
No no, why don’t you stay? We could have dinner together.

33:40.494 --> 33:42.104
I mean, if you’re interested.

33:44.128 --> 33:46.622
- I’d like that.
- Good.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.738
I’ll go get drinks.

33:56.028 --> 33:57.159
That looks great.

33:57.328 --> 34:01.959
Oh yeah, a start up company gave us 100 for free as a test run.

34:02.249 --> 34:06.889
I know it’s the last thing on your mind but business is fine.

34:08.018 --> 34:10.831
It’s a strange world when the least important thing is doing well,

34:10.862 --> 34:13.971
and the most important thing is just hanging on.

34:15.147 --> 34:19.893
Yeah. Is there anything else I can do?

34:20.800 --> 34:23.775
Yeah, could you thank Dan for me?

34:23.927 --> 34:25.898
I haven’t had a chance, things have been so crazy,

34:25.949 --> 34:28.924
but as soon as I can leave the hospital I’ll stop by the house.

34:29.585 --> 34:31.853
Dan isn’t living at the house anymore.

34:32.947 --> 34:33.989
What do you mean?

34:34.572 --> 34:35.688
We’re getting a divorce.

34:38.913 --> 34:42.416
This may sound crazy but I’m sorry.

34:43.734 --> 34:44.688
Thanks.

34:47.806 --> 34:48.657
See ya.

34:53.183 --> 34:54.284
It was only six weeks.

35:16.764 --> 35:18.413
That car is perfect for you.

35:19.621 --> 35:20.440
How is that?

35:20.897 --> 35:22.862
Smooth lines, sleek styling.

35:24.641 --> 35:25.515
Dan Scott.

35:26.303 --> 35:30.066
Pleasure to meet you, Dan. Cynthia Price. Your wife’s new attorney.

35:32.402 --> 35:36.441
I came here to tell you I’ve read the mediation agreement and I think it’s more than fair.

35:36.532 --> 35:38.898
I wanted to give you a last chance to accept it.

35:39.282 --> 35:42.733
Sorry sweat heart, I’ve got a lot invested in my marriage and my family.

35:43.216 --> 35:45.205
Deb’s not getting rid of me that easy.

35:45.488 --> 35:48.054
Is that love talking or just a bruised ego?

35:48.414 --> 35:52.537
Roll the dice and find out. But first, you go back to your client

35:52.595 --> 35:56.092
and you ask her if she’s ready for what will come out about her if she does go to trial.

36:01.110 --> 36:02.005
See you in court.

36:16.141 --> 36:16.853
Hey man.

36:18.896 --> 36:20.258
I kind of need to talk to you.

36:28.163 --> 36:32.178
So I’m here because everything’s screwed up.

36:37.292 --> 36:40.611
I know you don’t trust me with Haley,

36:41.896 --> 36:44.420
but I like her a lot, you know?

36:46.078 --> 36:47.712
She’s hurting right now too.

36:49.771 --> 36:51.767
She needs you to open your eyes, man.

36:53.775 --> 36:55.657
She feels like she can’t be forgiven.

36:58.043 --> 36:59.904
And I’m sort of in the same place.

37:16.339 --> 37:21.440
This accident, might not turn out so bad, you know?

37:22.913 --> 37:24.680
You get to take a break from the game.

37:25.811 --> 37:28.114
The pressure and peoples expectations.

37:30.997 --> 37:32.606
I wish I had that chance.

37:33.861 --> 37:35.538
This might be hard to believe but...

37:36.844 --> 37:38.242
maybe you’re the lucky one.

37:40.936 --> 37:41.995
You can get out.

37:56.281 --> 37:57.151
Hey.

38:00.559 --> 38:01.584
Water.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.145
What are you doing here?

38:28.890 --> 38:29.965
It’s a long story.

38:31.112 --> 38:32.044
Let me get your mom.

38:48.346 --> 38:49.104
Nathan?

38:49.871 --> 38:51.884
I think Lucas wants to talk to you.

38:58.501 --> 38:59.287
Lucas?

39:00.490 --> 39:02.140
Wake up sweetie, come on.

39:02.455 --> 39:03.352
Talk to me.

39:06.851 --> 39:12.307
Don’t take my sunshine away.

39:13.234 --> 39:14.432
You heard that.

39:18.222 --> 39:20.306
I’m glad your back, mom.

39:21.498 --> 39:22.526
You too.

39:24.656 --> 39:27.213
Now I can kill you for that tattoo.

39:38.620 --> 39:40.765
Nathan, I am not in the mood right now, okay?

39:42.895 --> 39:44.175
Lucas’ is awake.

39:46.403 --> 39:49.935
I was there when he opened his eyes. I went to see him.

39:51.796 --> 39:52.744
Why?

39:53.497 --> 39:54.650
Cause I knew you couldn’t.

39:56.612 --> 39:58.920
I wanted him to know that you were thinking about him.

40:02.317 --> 40:05.873
Look, I know that it was wrong to go after you for the reasons that I did.

40:07.395 --> 40:10.200
I can’t apologize for it. I’m glad I did it.

40:12.095 --> 40:14.840
I’m not that person anymore. It’s because of you.

40:18.290 --> 40:19.600
Let me take you to him.

41:23.219 --> 41:26.986
He handed me the consent forms, he needed surgery you have a right to be upset but...

41:35.000 --> 41:36.392
Thank you.

42:03.794 --> 42:07.865
Hey buddy. I missed you.
