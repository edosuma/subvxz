01:21.873 --> 01:23.409
Yeah, it's been a busy couple of weeks.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.416
-Mmm. How's the hip been feeling?
-Oh, feels great.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.539
Just got to manage the pain a little bit.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.460
Afraid it's not going to be that simple.

01:33.176 --> 01:36.885
Your articular cartilage
is severely deteriorated.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.047
You have osteoarthritis.

01:42.311 --> 01:45.519
I'm sorry, I blacked out for a second.
I thought you said I had arthritis.

01:46.148 --> 01:49.185
You've been walking around
with your ball and socket rubbed raw.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.188
-And you might need a replacement.
-A hip replacement?

01:53.322 --> 01:56.780
(LAUGHS) Come on. That shit's for gummers.
Come on, I'm 40.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.699
Forty-one, and your hip thinks you're 80.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.074
(LAUGHS) Okay,
my ball and socket are just fine, okay?

02:03.206 --> 02:06.289
Maybe I banged it up a little bit,
but I've been walking on this thing for years.

02:06.376 --> 02:10.870
And you've also been popping pills
like Altoids and avoiding physical exams,

02:11.006 --> 02:12.621
which is exactly why you're in this position.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.753
Listen, we can talk about my hip replacement
when I get my AARP card.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.256
But until then,
I'm gonna stick with pain management.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.505
Not gonna happen.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.012
-What are you saying?
-We had an arrangement.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.768
Yeah, we did have an arrangement.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.312
l was gonna come in for my physical,
and then you give me my pills.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.106
-There's a much bigger problem here.
-Yeah, you won't give me my pills.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.921
I'm not so sure you do anymore.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.008
You said he was a moneymaker.
He'd be a great piece of business for us.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.090
You know, his attitude needs a major tune-up.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.469
He almost got me killed in the Glades.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.425

more than I did.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.935
I think you really should wait
until your registration clears.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.190

We'll leave finance out of it.

this is a dangerously gray area.

I had some of the guys from the team sign it.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.765
I got a lot of friends over there,
it shouldn't take this long.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.844
-Then you fucking call them.
-God damn it, man.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.348
I can't do everything around here, okay?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.726
Stop jerking off
and get some fucking answers

03:53.817 --> 03:57.150
so we can sign Travis Mack and I can get
Anderson's foot out of my ass.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.653
Okay, I'll go light a fucking fire.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.321

we don't want to do.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.908
Like, you think I wanted to go on that stage

11:10.003 --> 11:11.994
and put myself on display
like a piece of meat?

11:12.672 --> 11:13.832
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I do.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.882
No, I did not. And I did it
to help the Webster feed the homeless.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.834
Now if you can't get past your
good-natured self and do it,

11:19.929 --> 11:21.339
I'll go over there and do it for you.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.463
What is this, Ricky Martin's...
Oh, sh....

11:23.558 --> 11:24.889
Hey, Bell.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.595
-Long time no see, Rick.
-Mmm.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.351
What's up?
You boys are out on the prowl tonight?

11:32.442 --> 11:34.433
-Married.
-Hell, yeah. You see all these...

11:34.903 --> 11:36.359
Nope, nope.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.983
Just helping my man
get his mind off some shit.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.356
Yeah, I have a penchant for fashion.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.532
Particularly skinny jeans.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.283
They give me the nut support
that I receive on the field, off field,

11:47.498 --> 11:49.204
and make my butt look tight.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.661
-Good to see you, Bell.
-Good to see you.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.118
Wait, I'm...

11:57.467 --> 11:58.798
Can I get you a drink?

12:00.678 --> 12:02.134
I'm a fuck-up, man.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.670
Oh, come on. Don't say that.

12:04.307 --> 12:07.891
No, man, everything I do turns to shit.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.102
Shakedowns, injuries,

12:12.232 --> 12:14.723
demonic, overgrown fucking poodle
on the loose and shit.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.318
I can't do shit right.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.150
Well, you got Vern out of Crenshaw, right?

12:18.821 --> 12:20.322
Man, his talent did that.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.113
Yeah, but you kept him
off the corner and in the classroom.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.033
How you know about it?

12:26.329 --> 12:27.944
Me and Nate text a lot.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.284
I mean, mostly about weed, but, you know...

12:30.750 --> 12:32.581
He speaks up for you is what I'm saying.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.330
-Maybe Vernon is better off without me now.
-Oh, come on.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.421
Look, it's not easy playing second banana
to a star like Vern.

12:42.845 --> 12:46.633
Believe me.
But, without Pippen, there'd be no Jordan.

12:47.058 --> 12:50.425
Right?
Without Flavor Flav, there'd be no Chuck D.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.513
Without, uh, Garfunkel, there'd be no Simon.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.233
Know what I'm saying?

12:56.651 --> 12:59.518
Okay, I did until you mentioned the
Garfunkel shit, then you lost me.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.811
It sound like two old white men.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.864
Simon and Garfunkel are two very old
white men, yeah.

13:05.243 --> 13:08.280
I don't know why I thought referencing them
would help illustrate my point,

13:08.371 --> 13:12.114
but what I'm saying is, we have value.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.241
You know? And Spencer and Vern know that.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.081
They know that.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.045
Shit. Look, look, look.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.497
(WHISPERING) Right there. Now, go, go, go.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.629
I got it. Shit.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.508
Hey. Listen, Rihanna.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.511
Look, I'm sorry
for throwing shade your way, okay?

13:32.228 --> 13:36.471
Now, my boy Vernon
needs a new friend, okay?

13:36.649 --> 13:39.231
Now, you're not as funny
or as charming as me,

13:39.319 --> 13:43.403
but they say pets heal emotional wounds
that people can't.

13:44.073 --> 13:47.531
Okay, so, hey, man, let's give my man...

13:47.827 --> 13:50.409
Let's give my man Vernon... Give him a smile.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.695
Yeah? Yeah.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.077
There we go.

13:56.419 --> 13:59.411
Buffalo's on the rise.
The culture up there has completely changed.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.292
Ricky, the culture in western New York
never changes.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.673
You think you're gonna find
a fashion show in Buffalo

14:04.761 --> 14:06.672
that isn't built around
hunting and fishing gear?

14:07.930 --> 14:11.093
They came in big, though, Bella.
They showed a lot of love.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.468
You already have more money put away
than any player I know.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.557
Any other offers?

14:17.940 --> 14:20.272
-Yeah, New Orleans.
-Oh, that would be cool.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.392
We had a great time at Jazz Fest.

14:23.946 --> 14:24.935
We did.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.020
(LAUGHS)

14:28.785 --> 14:31.242
And you should have plenty more offers
after the year you had.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.112
-Oh, you've been following me?
-You were on my fantasy team.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.239
We talking football or daydreams?

14:37.502 --> 14:39.163
You helped me win my league.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.379
(BOTH LAUGH)

14:41.798 --> 14:43.914
I'm glad I can do right by you for once.

(APPLAUSE)

14:47.011 --> 14:48.876
Look, it's not my place to say,

14:50.014 --> 14:51.254
but if you have to leave Miami,

14:51.349 --> 14:53.465
you should go someplace
that's really right for you.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.386
Now, I don't know where that is,
but I'm pretty sure it's not Buffalo.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.313
I hope you figure it out.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.270
-It was good to see you, Bella.
-You, too.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.692
Maybe we should bring Vern out here, huh?

15:12.829 --> 15:15.491
I don't want Rih-Rih shitting all over
the marble floors.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.330
Yeah, good idea.
All the excitement might make her nervous.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.457
JOE: Yeah, making me nervous.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.168
I might shit all over the marble floors.

Maybe I ain't all that.

Well, it's natural to feel that way.

-Yes, Clyde. He called.

Uh, okay, let's give this a crack.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.463
My first contract was in '96.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.595
Five over five, one million guaranteed.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.181
Four-year extension in '99.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.391
$12 million, three of it guaranteed.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.106
Next contract after that was post Super Bowl.

25:28.277 --> 25:30.438
$20 million with six of it guaranteed.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.112
It was cut in half, though, when I got traded.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.281
And then the downtick started to happen.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.030
After that, it was 10 for three.

-Mmm-hmm.

I spent in New Orleans. Great city.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.844
Made the vet league minimum
of 925k per year.

25:58.724 --> 26:01.807
You netted almost $30 million
over the course of your career.

-I had a hell of a career.
-So my next question is...

26:06.106 --> 26:07.846
-Where did it all go?
-Can you blame me?

26:08.025 --> 26:09.140
No.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.277
I had to take care of a lot of people back then.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.948
Did I have some luxuries? Yes, absolutely.

26:18.035 --> 26:21.994
But there was never any
gross misappropriation of funds ever.

26:22.331 --> 26:25.664
And like a lot of players back then,
I thought it would last forever,

26:25.751 --> 26:27.662
but I realize now that it doesn't,

26:27.920 --> 26:29.376
and I'm a much better man for it.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.876
l have a private placement memorandum here.

26:33.967 --> 26:37.175
It's a real estate deal in conjunction
with a Mr. Andre Allen.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.925
Yeah. Yeah.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.507
Uh, took a loss
just like everybody else in 2008.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.009
Nothing egregious.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.687
Well, from where I'm sitting,
it looks as egregious as it gets.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.520
Anyone else involved?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.817
NO. No, not that I know of.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.654
-Just me.
-Okay.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.081
Look, you were in the union,

27:05.374 --> 27:07.205
so I want to give you the benefit of the doubt,

27:07.459 --> 27:09.415
but too many of our guys
are ending up broke.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.622
So we're gonna need to look deeper into this.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.329
-Okay?
-Sure. Sure.

-Yeah. Hey, thank you.
