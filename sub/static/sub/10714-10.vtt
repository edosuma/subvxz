WEBVTT

00:02.928 --> 00:05.699
Have you ever noticed there
are no female cereal mascots?

00:06.046 --> 00:08.738
How does eating cereal
become a feminist issue?

00:10.875 --> 00:16.277
There's Tony the Tiger; Toucan Sam;
Snap, Crackle, and Pop; Captain Crunch.

00:16.279 --> 00:18.219
What about Fruity
Pebbles? Pebbles is a girl.

00:18.548 --> 00:20.715
Nice try, but Fred and
Barney are on the box.

00:23.052 --> 00:24.440
What do you want from me?

00:28.024 --> 00:29.238
Dad, what are you doing here?

00:29.658 --> 00:31.042
That's a greeting?

00:31.227 --> 00:33.127
No "Hello, Dad, nice to see you"?

00:33.129 --> 00:34.395
Hello, Dad, nice...

00:34.397 --> 00:35.603
Now it's too late.

00:37.766 --> 00:39.533
We've got a hankering for lemonade.

00:39.535 --> 00:41.861
You've always got this
weird bowl full of lemons

00:41.886 --> 00:43.856
just sitting here doing jack squat.

00:44.339 --> 00:46.136
You never use them.

00:46.161 --> 00:49.912
Not once have we tasted a dish in
this house that had a lemon flavor.

00:50.847 --> 00:52.283
Just take 'em.

00:53.631 --> 00:56.653
Oh, my God, I just got a job
interview at the Weisman Space Center!

00:56.678 --> 00:58.978
- Oh, congratulations, sweetheart.
- Fantastic.

00:59.003 --> 01:02.664
I'll be honest; I never got
this ladies-in-space stuff

01:02.689 --> 01:05.206
until I saw Sandy
Bullock in that "Gravity."

01:06.961 --> 01:09.320
But I think she handled
herself real well.

01:11.866 --> 01:14.986
I've always wanted to work at
the Weisman. I'm so excited!

01:15.441 --> 01:16.641
Oh, no.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.517
I can already feel the sleep
I'm not gonna get tonight.

01:19.542 --> 01:21.015
I should have slept more last night;

01:21.040 --> 01:22.884
but if I'd known, I
wouldn't have slept at all.

01:23.945 --> 01:26.111
What if I screw it up?
Then I'll never sleep.

01:26.113 --> 01:28.185
Knowing you, you'll get the
job, you're gonna do great,

01:28.210 --> 01:30.127
and you're gonna win a Nobel Prize.

01:30.152 --> 01:31.780
I do have my speech ready.

01:32.786 --> 01:34.886
But what if it sounds over-rehearsed?

01:34.888 --> 01:36.255
What if it's too long?

01:36.257 --> 01:38.990
What if they play me off with
that weird Norwegian award music?

01:41.628 --> 01:45.096
The point is, we're taking the
lemons. Come on, Alice. Let's go.

01:46.266 --> 01:48.962
So, viewers, this is my kitchen.

01:49.402 --> 01:51.202
There's my nerdy sister.

01:51.204 --> 01:53.137
There's my giant dad.

01:53.139 --> 01:55.378
- Wave to the camera, Dad.
- No.

01:56.777 --> 01:58.412
Classic Dad.

01:59.195 --> 02:01.741
- Tell me what's happening.
- Stella's got a YouTube channel.

02:01.766 --> 02:04.259
I'm giving Mom an on-camera
makeover for your date tonight.

02:04.284 --> 02:06.275
My fans are very excited.

02:06.919 --> 02:08.608
I took this from Sephora.

02:08.633 --> 02:11.456
You can also buy it, but
that's more expensive.

02:13.282 --> 02:16.255
Oop! Purse spill, BRB.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.080
What's with all the pills?

02:18.105 --> 02:19.371
Just the usual.

02:19.396 --> 02:20.989
Birth control.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.394
Plan B in case I forget
to take my birth control.

02:25.004 --> 02:26.536
Oh, and my actress pills.

02:26.538 --> 02:29.450
I have an antianxiety prescription
to help me with auditions.

02:29.475 --> 02:31.308
Now you have an anxiety problem?

02:31.310 --> 02:34.137
Not after a glass of Pinot
and two of these bad boys.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.217
What is this one?

02:36.242 --> 02:37.447
It's Viagra.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.383
Way to act like you didn't know, Dad.

02:40.304 --> 02:42.252
You dating some super-old guy?

02:42.254 --> 02:45.321
And if you are, can he
marry you and pay your bills?

02:47.058 --> 02:49.749
Lots of young guys take
Viagra as a party drug.

02:49.774 --> 02:51.805
They say it's even more
fun when you don't need it.

02:51.830 --> 02:55.331
Anyway, it's not mine; I'm
holding it for a friend.

02:55.333 --> 02:58.903
Whoa, that's the first time
I've said that and it was true.

03:02.789 --> 03:04.555
Oh, she missed one.

03:04.808 --> 03:06.434
It's an antianxiety pill.

03:06.744 --> 03:08.400
You know, I do have that job interview.

03:08.746 --> 03:10.679
Maybe I should take it
to smooth out my edges.

03:10.681 --> 03:13.055
I don't think taking
floor pills is the answer.

03:14.161 --> 03:17.471
Look, your mother is a therapist.
Why don't you go talk to her?

03:17.496 --> 03:20.202
I'll do that, and I'll
give this back to Stella.

03:22.564 --> 03:24.094
On the one hand, I should be able to

03:24.119 --> 03:26.617
deal with my stress
without taking this pill.

03:26.642 --> 03:28.416
On the other hand,

03:28.799 --> 03:30.090
I just took it.

03:30.787 --> 03:32.025
Uh... ooh...

03:57.264 --> 03:58.574
Oh, hey, sweetie!

03:59.328 --> 04:00.895
Come look at my makeover.

04:00.897 --> 04:02.531
Aw, Mom.

04:03.265 --> 04:05.197
You're such a pretty mom.

04:06.803 --> 04:09.078
So, so pretty.

04:10.573 --> 04:12.201
Pretty, pretty Mom.

04:13.569 --> 04:15.976
Wow, thank you, honey.

04:16.178 --> 04:19.370
Dad tells me you're nervous
about your job interview.

04:19.396 --> 04:22.549
Just remember, keep your
shoulders loose; don't turtle.

04:22.574 --> 04:25.063
Aww, turtles.

04:26.054 --> 04:27.802
And don't forget I'm a resource.

04:27.827 --> 04:30.637
Helping anxious people is exactly the
kind of thing I went to school for,

04:30.662 --> 04:33.179
- so people should take advantage of...
- Okay, bye-bye.

04:35.248 --> 04:37.396
Look at you. Stella did a great job.

04:37.398 --> 04:41.872
I know! Some YouTube
commenter named ILoveMILFs...

04:42.780 --> 04:45.571
made a comment so filthy,
it was in violation

04:45.573 --> 04:48.431
of their Terms of Service
policy. Isn't that sweet?

04:48.876 --> 04:50.077
Congratulations.

04:50.102 --> 04:53.289
On a related topic, a
recreational party enhancer

04:53.314 --> 04:55.603
happens to have fallen into my hands.

04:55.856 --> 04:57.770
What did Stella give you?

04:57.885 --> 05:00.918
She didn't give it to me. She
dropped it and I found it. But...

05:00.943 --> 05:05.932
turns out it's not just for old couples
in side-by-side outdoor bathtubs.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.396
But, honey, you don't need it.

05:08.796 --> 05:11.232
I know, but what if
it makes me 22 again?

05:11.510 --> 05:18.555
Mm, to be honest, I remember 22-year-old
Mike as energetic but unschooled.

05:20.203 --> 05:23.666
Because he didn't have the knowledge
and technique of modern-day Mike.

05:23.691 --> 05:24.891
Think about it.

05:25.111 --> 05:27.774
Experienced, thoughtful Mike up here,

05:28.382 --> 05:30.599
22-year-old Mike down below.

05:34.654 --> 05:37.354
Like some kind of mythological beast.

05:39.959 --> 05:41.675
I'm rethinking my opposition.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.294
Good, because I already took it.

05:44.884 --> 05:46.203
Wow.

05:46.532 --> 05:48.132
Wow.

05:48.530 --> 05:51.800
The beast is no longer... mythological.

05:59.341 --> 06:03.022
So why did you insist we go up in
your chopper? What's the big mystery?

06:03.047 --> 06:05.608
Well, I want to talk about something...

06:05.968 --> 06:08.833
something that I'm not
comfortable talking about on Earth.

06:11.343 --> 06:13.100
Plus, this way, if it
gets really awkward,

06:13.125 --> 06:15.503
I can crash into some
rocks and kill us both.

06:16.506 --> 06:17.706
So what is it?

06:18.183 --> 06:20.683
It's just... uh...

06:20.685 --> 06:22.485
have you ever had to ask your doctor

06:22.487 --> 06:24.530
if you were healthy enough for sex?

06:25.153 --> 06:28.233
What the hell kind of relationship
do you think I have with my doctor?

06:30.562 --> 06:34.464
Have you ever needed to chemically
assist your intimate performance?

06:34.466 --> 06:37.816
Just come right out with it or
crash us into those rocks down there.

06:37.841 --> 06:39.908
Your call. I'm good either way.

06:41.639 --> 06:43.372
Do you use Viagra?

06:43.374 --> 06:44.722
No, I don't.

06:44.842 --> 06:46.992
Nice talk. Take us down.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.130
'Cause I tried one just for fun.

06:49.155 --> 06:51.872
I was hoping I could borrow a
couple from you, but never mind.

06:51.897 --> 06:53.812
So was it fun?

06:53.837 --> 06:57.329
- Yeah, it was like I was 22 again.
- Hmm.

06:57.477 --> 07:01.079
Okay, son, I think I
know what you need to do.

07:01.104 --> 07:02.334
Oh, yeah, what is that, Dad?

07:02.359 --> 07:03.615
Get me some.

07:04.452 --> 07:06.292
I'd like to be 22 again.

07:07.148 --> 07:10.026
Big Swinging Bob was
something to be reckoned with.

07:15.759 --> 07:17.886
Wow, so he doesn't need anything.

07:17.911 --> 07:20.475
At his age, impressive.

07:20.693 --> 07:21.893
Please...

07:22.144 --> 07:26.124
please, stop being impressed
by my father's sexual prowess.

07:27.850 --> 07:31.615
Honey, don't be so sensitive.
We took it once for fun.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.933
- You don't need it either.
- Of course not, but it was fun, though.

07:34.958 --> 07:36.475
It made me feel young again.

07:36.692 --> 07:38.717
Made me feel young again too.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.673
Maybe we should do
it just one more time,

07:43.842 --> 07:45.099
relive our youth.

07:45.124 --> 07:46.625
But you'd have to get a prescription.

07:46.835 --> 07:49.419
Not really. Stella's room is like a CVS.

07:52.107 --> 07:54.419
Mike, we shouldn't invade
her privacy like that.

07:54.444 --> 07:57.344
Well, she invaded our privacy
first by moving back in.

07:57.792 --> 07:59.712
We're actually doing a
service for the community.

07:59.714 --> 08:01.185
We're taking drugs off the street.

08:02.450 --> 08:04.382
And putting them in your body.

08:04.407 --> 08:06.282
It's recycling. We're going green.

08:13.036 --> 08:16.166
Oh, my God! Grandma's ring.

08:16.235 --> 08:18.724
Didn't we tell the insurance
company that was stolen?

08:19.181 --> 08:22.150
Well, it technically was... by Stella.

08:22.287 --> 08:24.494
Ah, jackpot.

08:24.883 --> 08:27.452
I knew having kids
would pay off one day.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.657
- What are you guys doing here?
- Um...

08:34.782 --> 08:37.227
- So this is the load-bearing wall.
- Oh!

08:38.625 --> 08:40.595
What are you doing here, Shea?

08:41.053 --> 08:45.091
I was just looking for
one of, uh, Stella's, uh,

08:45.116 --> 08:46.710
antianxiety pills!

08:46.735 --> 08:47.935
Yeah, that's it!

08:51.398 --> 08:52.696
Wait, that is it.

08:58.805 --> 09:01.362
Well, well, well, what do we have here?

09:01.740 --> 09:02.949
Open the hands.

09:04.476 --> 09:06.148
My anxiety pills.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.064
Let's see it, big guy.

09:10.215 --> 09:11.456
Viagra.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.109
Grandma's ring.

09:15.921 --> 09:18.802
I mean, oh, my God, you
found Grandma's ring!

09:19.191 --> 09:20.497
Score!

09:22.639 --> 09:26.082
Stella, I just needed the pills for
this job interview I have coming up.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.894
There's no way they're gonna
hire anxious, stressed-out Shea.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.867
But mellow Shea has a shot.

09:30.869 --> 09:32.214
Look, honey, you're an adult.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.497
If you want to take those
pills, you can, but...

09:34.522 --> 09:36.605
it's safer to get a
prescription for them.

09:36.607 --> 09:38.826
Wouldn't it be safer for you
guys to get a prescription?

09:38.851 --> 09:40.684
She's got us beat. Let's
make a break for it.

09:40.709 --> 09:41.909
Listen...

09:43.490 --> 09:45.744
You didn't have to steal the pills.

09:45.769 --> 09:47.468
You could have bought them from me.

09:49.032 --> 09:51.860
Look, young lady, we need
to have a talk about drugs...

09:51.954 --> 09:55.076
maybe another time, when we're
not stealing them from you, but...

09:56.477 --> 09:57.854
it's coming.

09:59.029 --> 10:00.628
Hey, we're family.

10:00.630 --> 10:02.171
First taste is free.

10:06.303 --> 10:09.101
Don't be ashamed, Dad. A
lot of older guys need it.

10:09.459 --> 10:10.904
I don't need it. Like you said,

10:10.929 --> 10:13.832
it's a party drug that a
lot of young people use.

10:15.212 --> 10:17.001
Also, I need one for Grandpa.

10:23.637 --> 10:25.549
Well, that was the last pill.

10:26.034 --> 10:27.603
The last pill.

10:28.191 --> 10:30.340
Say good-bye to the beast.

10:32.461 --> 10:34.742
- You're okay with that?
- Yeah, of course.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.722
- Well, okay.
- I mean, things were fine,

10:38.211 --> 10:42.211
and then we had, you
know, the pill experience,

10:42.236 --> 10:44.248
and now we go back to things being fine.

10:46.109 --> 10:47.504
You know what it is, Mike?

10:47.529 --> 10:51.201
It's like that time we got bumped
up from coach to first class.

10:51.203 --> 10:55.584
That was awesome. They
greeted us with champagne.

10:55.609 --> 10:59.352
Yeah, how about that
chilled lobster appetizer?

10:59.354 --> 11:01.254
Oh, it was better than
the food at our wedding.

11:01.256 --> 11:02.456
Yeah.

11:04.389 --> 11:05.696
What was our point, again?

11:07.334 --> 11:09.230
Oh, yeah, we're going back to coach.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.413
But in coach, you still
get to where you want to go.

11:15.537 --> 11:17.568
And isn't getting there together,

11:17.940 --> 11:20.211
or within a minute or two of each other,

11:22.159 --> 11:24.654
the whole point of
flying in the first place?

11:25.513 --> 11:28.181
Exactly. We're gonna be great.

11:28.206 --> 11:30.591
We're gonna be better than great.

11:46.050 --> 11:51.754
So you're saying Mike took Viagra
you loved it, but now you're worried.

11:51.779 --> 11:52.979
Yes.

11:53.102 --> 11:59.263
Well, Bob took Viagra, I loved it,
and I ain't complaining about [bleep].

12:06.861 --> 12:08.178
I'm just a little nervous

12:08.203 --> 12:10.800
about how things are gonna go
the next time we're together.

12:10.898 --> 12:14.601
It's like if we hadn't taken the pill,

12:14.603 --> 12:17.011
we wouldn't know what
we've been missing.

12:17.239 --> 12:22.529
So now I wish I could
unknow what I know, you know?

12:24.578 --> 12:27.015
- I'm right there with you.
- Shea!

12:27.381 --> 12:28.914
How long have you been there?

12:28.916 --> 12:30.391
Too long, really.

12:32.754 --> 12:34.987
I couldn't find a good entry into the

12:35.012 --> 12:37.737
"my dad and grandpa are
taking Viagra so they can

12:37.762 --> 12:40.651
give it to my mom and grandma
real good" conversation.

12:44.521 --> 12:46.633
Talk about wanting to
unknow what you know.

12:48.764 --> 12:50.302
Honey, what's going on?

12:50.471 --> 12:53.968
I'm also conflicted about the
morals of pharmaceutical enhancement.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.507
I have a pill that
might help me get a job,

12:56.509 --> 12:58.452
but if I get that job, did I get it,

12:58.477 --> 13:00.845
or did some chemically
aided version of me get it?

13:00.847 --> 13:02.666
And how can I feel good about that?

13:03.223 --> 13:04.550
That's not a rhetorical question;

13:04.575 --> 13:07.370
tell me how I can feel good about
it, because I really want that job.

13:07.698 --> 13:10.050
You guys, crisis.

13:10.075 --> 13:13.229
I promised myself I wouldn't read
the comments on my YouTube channel,

13:13.254 --> 13:15.909
and then I did, and now
I just wish I hadn't.

13:15.934 --> 13:19.012
I know haters gonna hate, and I
know I'm supposed to shake it off.

13:21.653 --> 13:24.479
But how? How? She doesn't tell you how!

13:26.472 --> 13:28.995
Okay, that's it!

13:29.241 --> 13:33.373
You, either like the sex
you have or get the pills.

13:33.398 --> 13:38.743
You, either trust that they'll like
the person you are or take the pills.

13:40.853 --> 13:45.599
And you, I can't believe you're
the one whose problem isn't pills.

13:49.965 --> 13:52.426
I'm beginning to like this new system.

13:52.764 --> 13:54.964
I feel like I can say anything up here.

13:54.966 --> 13:58.057
Like, damn it, I'm gonna
miss "Downton Abbey."

13:59.734 --> 14:01.904
Even that stuff with Mr. Bates?

14:01.906 --> 14:04.344
I didn't say it was
a perfect show, Mike!

14:05.609 --> 14:08.311
Anyway, I want to thank
you for giving me that pill.

14:08.313 --> 14:11.080
The thing is, I... I'd like some more.

14:11.082 --> 14:12.915
Sorry, but my source dried up.

14:12.917 --> 14:15.784
You don't understand,
Mike. I can't go back.

14:15.786 --> 14:17.518
Alice is a new woman.

14:17.543 --> 14:19.651
This morning, she made me real bacon.

14:19.824 --> 14:22.349
Real bacon, Mike, not
that turkey [bleep].

14:23.308 --> 14:25.322
- I'd love to help you, Dad...
- I need it, Mike!

14:25.347 --> 14:27.778
I need it bad! I'm
chasing the dragon here!

14:28.730 --> 14:30.384
Settle down, Dad!

14:30.409 --> 14:33.298
Neither of us was using
before, and things were good.

14:33.323 --> 14:36.180
You're not nervous about
going into battle unarmed?

14:36.205 --> 14:37.562
Because I am!

14:37.587 --> 14:41.512
I don't want Alice to give me that
"don't worry, it's fine" speech.

14:42.668 --> 14:44.581
I hate the "don't
worry, it's fine" speech.

14:44.606 --> 14:46.819
I was there. I know things weren't fine.

14:47.816 --> 14:51.353
Look, the bottom line is,
I don't have any more pills.

14:51.378 --> 14:53.287
You got to get a
prescription from your doctor.

14:53.289 --> 14:56.648
My doctor? I'm not telling
that handsy bastard about this.

14:58.494 --> 15:01.288
Well, that's your only option.
They're about $10 a pill.

15:01.313 --> 15:02.757
$10?

15:02.915 --> 15:05.464
I haven't paid that much
for sex since Saigon.

15:07.685 --> 15:09.648
And I had to talk her down.

15:10.776 --> 15:11.976
What?

15:12.131 --> 15:15.083
You always ask me to talk about
the war; I'm talking about it.

15:27.555 --> 15:30.470
- Look, Mike...
- I don't need a recap.

15:30.495 --> 15:32.592
I know that was coach sex.

15:33.494 --> 15:35.428
Don't worry. It's fine.

15:36.672 --> 15:38.531
Oh, come... we're just...

15:40.535 --> 15:42.822
We're just putting too
much pressure on ourselves.

15:42.847 --> 15:45.541
We just have to get out of
our heads. Let's watch some TV.

15:45.566 --> 15:47.541
Mm-hm, Mets are playing.

15:47.874 --> 15:51.196
And it's a swing and a miss for Johnson.

15:51.979 --> 15:57.186
Oh, what a letdown. Usually,
he's one of the team's big bats.

15:58.052 --> 16:01.923
He cannot feel good about
tonight's performance.

16:04.291 --> 16:05.493
Too soon.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.810
Well, so it's come to this:
I'm in the parking garage

16:14.835 --> 16:18.043
of a doctor's office, waiting
to get a prescription for Viagra.

16:20.194 --> 16:21.599
I mean, what's next? Hearing aids?

16:21.624 --> 16:24.038
That little chair that
rides up and down the stairs?

16:25.069 --> 16:27.312
Ooh, I've always wanted one of those.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.849
They do look like fun, huh?

16:31.361 --> 16:33.845
You know, from now on when they
ask what prescriptions I take,

16:33.870 --> 16:35.663
I'm gonna have to list this.

16:35.698 --> 16:38.512
I'm gonna have to put it
on forms, Martina. Forms!

16:38.537 --> 16:42.702
Okay, let's try to chill
out. Take some deep breaths.

16:43.873 --> 16:45.277
Listen to some music.

16:45.302 --> 16:47.312
Um, I'll put on a relaxation CD.

16:47.337 --> 16:50.254
But not that whale songs
one. It makes me sad.

16:50.279 --> 16:51.989
They all sound like they need my help.

16:54.050 --> 16:56.711
Vodka? What's vodka doing in the car?

16:56.736 --> 16:57.953
Stella.

16:59.288 --> 17:01.011
We did something right with that one.

17:02.224 --> 17:04.843
- I wouldn't mind a shot.
- Me neither.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.294
We take her pills; we might
as well drink her booze.

17:09.098 --> 17:15.112
I seem to recall Stella was conceived
in a car not unlike this one.

17:18.006 --> 17:21.280
I kept honking the horn
by accident with my back.

17:21.810 --> 17:24.997
That was an accident? I thought
you were saying, "Good job."

17:27.048 --> 17:28.453
Remember that?

17:28.783 --> 17:31.551
Having sex in cars?

17:31.576 --> 17:36.970
It was all so new and
exciting and crazy.

17:37.801 --> 17:39.268
Long time ago.

17:39.293 --> 17:41.043
Doesn't feel that long ago.

17:41.662 --> 17:44.247
You are just as beautiful
as the day I met you.

17:45.733 --> 17:47.653
More beautiful, I would say.

17:48.903 --> 17:54.495
And you, still so strong and handsome.

17:54.825 --> 17:57.793
Look at these things.
They're like granite.

17:58.913 --> 18:00.167
Keep talking.

18:00.926 --> 18:02.140
Or...

18:02.749 --> 18:04.923
maybe we should stop talking.

18:07.273 --> 18:09.500
_

18:10.313 --> 18:11.960
Hey, here's an idea.

18:11.985 --> 18:14.326
Well, I loved your
last one. I'm all ears.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.742
Let's get out of here.

18:17.964 --> 18:21.569
We don't need those
pills. We got a backseat.

18:21.594 --> 18:23.025
You know what? You're right.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.248
This will be my new pickup line.

18:32.674 --> 18:36.280
Look, Dad, Mom's makeover
video already has 80,000 views.

18:36.315 --> 18:37.914
And you can make money off that?

18:37.950 --> 18:40.381
Even better, I get exposure.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.953
And how does that lead
to your own apartment?

18:43.605 --> 18:46.169
Dad, you're so funny.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.737
Could not have been more serious.

18:51.356 --> 18:54.409
All right, I have got
champagne and tissues for Shea.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.924
Champagne if she got the job.

18:55.949 --> 18:57.809
Tissues and champagne if she didn't.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.516
Hey, did you get the job?

19:03.551 --> 19:04.551
I did.

19:04.576 --> 19:05.908
- Hey!
- Yay!

19:05.943 --> 19:06.976
But then I lost it.

19:07.011 --> 19:08.811
- Oh.
- Aww.

19:08.846 --> 19:10.413
What happened, honey?

19:10.448 --> 19:14.524
Thanks to the antianxiety pills,
I was relaxed, calm, confident,

19:14.549 --> 19:18.125
but then they told me all new employees
are required to take a drug test,

19:18.156 --> 19:21.389
at which point I ran out of the
room abruptly and came right home.

19:23.360 --> 19:27.356
I don't think they test
for antianxiety medication.

19:27.464 --> 19:28.831
I know that now.

19:28.866 --> 19:31.999
But I don't think they're going to hire
the person who squealed and ran away

19:32.024 --> 19:33.734
when she heard the words "drug test."

19:36.107 --> 19:37.736
Did I not mention I squealed?

19:40.211 --> 19:43.817
Rookie mistake. You
always bring clean pee.

19:44.014 --> 19:45.979
And I could have gotten you some.

19:47.585 --> 19:49.747
Oh, wait, I get mine from you.

19:50.421 --> 19:52.151
How did I not know that?

19:54.157 --> 19:55.748
How do I unknow that?

19:57.975 --> 19:59.175
Mike!

20:00.563 --> 20:02.023
We need to talk.

20:04.922 --> 20:07.279
Okay, we've reached speaking altitude.

20:08.038 --> 20:12.002
I wanted you to know I caved
in and got a prescription...

20:12.308 --> 20:15.563
not from my doctor but
from some queer downtown.

20:16.946 --> 20:19.791
Dad, I don't know if we're
at homophobic altitude.

20:19.816 --> 20:22.408
What? That's how he identifies.

20:22.433 --> 20:26.517
He thought "bisexual" was constrictive.
I'm trying to be respectful here.

20:27.390 --> 20:30.057
Look, if you need a
pill, I'll give you one.

20:30.092 --> 20:33.754
Well, thanks, but I'm off them;
I'm clean. What changed your mind?

20:33.779 --> 20:36.121
Well, I figure I'll take
one every now and again

20:36.146 --> 20:38.365
when I want real bacon in the morning.

20:40.419 --> 20:43.144
Hey, let's face it; I
take pills for my heart,

20:43.169 --> 20:45.895
and I like my Johnson a
lot more than my ticker.

20:48.176 --> 20:49.850
Better land this thing safely.

20:49.875 --> 20:53.127
I do not want those to be the
last words you ever say to me.
