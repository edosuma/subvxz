00:05.764 --> 00:07.564
<i>Yes, today's turning out</i>
<i>to be another</i>

00:07.632 --> 00:10.071
edge of your seat nail-biter
as both of these teams

00:10.191 --> 00:12.029
vie to move another step closer

00:12.149 --> 00:14.202
<i>to the 100th</i>
<i>Grey Cup Championship.</i>

00:14.322 --> 00:15.954
<i>And what may be the best part?</i>

00:16.192 --> 00:18.193
<i>The fan videos people are</i>
<i>making</i>

00:18.261 --> 00:21.630
<i>in the hopes of winning free</i>
<i>tickets for this year's cup.</i>

00:21.697 --> 00:24.266
Oh!
Some guys should never

00:24.333 --> 00:26.808
take their shirts off.
Dude, that's gross.

00:27.933 --> 00:29.636
- Uh!
- That was nice.

00:29.756 --> 00:31.162
Didn't know you could do that
with a football.

00:31.492 --> 00:33.559
Who are these crazy people?

00:33.627 --> 00:36.329
I can't blame 'em.
Grey Cup 100.

00:36.397 --> 00:39.065
We should have a made a video.
We would have totally won.

00:39.133 --> 00:41.900
Some kind of Criss Angel,

00:42.020 --> 00:43.733
David Blaine,
mind-reading thing.

00:43.853 --> 00:46.834
Yeah, IIB would love that,
huh? I think we'll be sitting

00:46.954 --> 00:49.033
- here on the couch.
- Oh, man, I got to bounce.

00:49.097 --> 00:51.833
What do you mean? Come on, it's
half-time, we've got half a pie left.

00:51.900 --> 00:54.386
What can I say? Sandy's
a better kisser than you are.

00:54.453 --> 00:57.455
- I imagine.
- Look, we only get the same night off once a week.

00:57.522 --> 01:00.024
We're just gonna fit in a date
before my shift. OK, right?

01:00.092 --> 01:02.826
- Follow your bliss. - Are you sure?
- Whatever floats your boat.

01:02.894 --> 01:05.376
- OK, Toby.
- Get some sleep.

01:05.495 --> 01:08.545
- Man, I got the cheerleaders, I'm OK.
- Cheerleaders aren't real.

01:08.665 --> 01:10.975
- It's all pretend.
- Anyway, go.

01:11.095 --> 01:13.996
- Say hello to Sandy.
- One day, you'll find someone.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.318
One day, Toby.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.825 --> 01:27.962
Hello, this is Franca Burrows.

01:28.082 --> 01:29.983
Happy office warming.

01:31.081 --> 01:32.486
You're more than welcome.

01:32.606 --> 01:35.554
Everything is in order, I hope?

01:35.622 --> 01:40.226
I'm afraid I won't be able to join you
this evening, something has come up.

01:40.293 --> 01:43.595
Exactly. No rest for the wicked.

01:43.663 --> 01:47.066
Listen, I really am counting on your support
for the Children First Benefit next week.

01:51.137 --> 01:54.233
Great!

01:54.663 --> 01:58.505
Well, listen, don't hesitate to get a
hold of me if you need anything. OK?

01:58.625 --> 02:00.345
Take care. Bye-bye.

02:08.490 --> 02:16.005

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:18.870 --> 02:21.005
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thanks.

02:21.073 --> 02:22.974
- Hey, there.
- Yeah, you're good.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.648
- All right.
- Klein, hey!

02:25.768 --> 02:27.802
- Good, I'm glad you're here.
- The chief of police,

02:27.870 --> 02:30.571
- this must be someone important.
- Let's just say the victim's

02:30.640 --> 02:33.780
in case of emergency contact
is the minister of Justice.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.208
Whoa!

02:40.567 --> 02:43.636
Her name is Franca Burrows.

02:43.703 --> 02:45.737
Burrows
as in the Opera Theatre?

02:45.805 --> 02:48.040
Yeah, and the Art Centre,
the sports teams,

02:48.107 --> 02:50.708
the mobile phone empire,
all founded by her husband,

02:50.776 --> 02:53.557
Kyle Burrows. Supposedly,
they were the perfect couple.

02:53.677 --> 02:57.348
Her father was a senator.
Both of her parents passed away

02:57.416 --> 03:00.017
leaving her six generations
of very old money.

03:00.085 --> 03:03.188
She parlayed her inheritance
into a successful

03:03.255 --> 03:07.257
real estate firm of her own. - A real
Upper Canada aristocrat.

03:07.325 --> 03:09.959
Whoever killed her tried to make
to make it look like a robbery

03:10.027 --> 03:12.862
- gone wrong. Purse is missing.
- But not her $600 phone

03:12.930 --> 03:14.898
or her luxury car.

03:14.965 --> 03:16.933
She was strangled
with some kind of rope,

03:17.001 --> 03:19.135
not really a mugger's
weapon of choice.

03:19.204 --> 03:21.671
It wasn't easy either.
Franca put up a fight.

03:21.738 --> 03:23.639
Hopefully, forensics
can pull the DNA.

03:23.707 --> 03:26.409
Messy, public.

03:26.476 --> 03:28.411
The killer wasn't a pro,
but he thought about this.

03:28.478 --> 03:31.347
Our canvas puts her
at a bistro down the street.

03:31.415 --> 03:33.616
Her waiter says that she
and a male companion argued.

03:33.684 --> 03:35.984
- She walked out.
- Do we have a description of this guy?

03:36.052 --> 03:38.386
Yeah, we do, but it's not
a match for the husband.

03:38.454 --> 03:41.590
- Whom we have trouble reaching.
- How about a phone? Anything?

03:41.657 --> 03:43.592
Well, it was still receiving
calls and texts

03:43.659 --> 03:45.560
- when we got here.
- Yeah, people wondering

03:45.628 --> 03:48.396
- where she was. She had plans.
- We sent it to Dev

03:48.464 --> 03:51.366
to check it out. Let's find out
where he's at with that.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.103
Dev, any luck
raising Kyle Burrows?

03:56.170 --> 03:59.139
His cell's off. There's no
reply at home, and his office

03:59.207 --> 04:01.174
is closed. But there's nothing
from him in her recent messages

04:01.243 --> 04:03.644
- that I can see.
- What about next of kin?

04:03.712 --> 04:06.513
There's no living blood
relatives, no kids.

04:06.581 --> 04:08.582
Franca's husband
was all she had.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.516
[Any leads on this guy
at the bistro?]

04:10.584 --> 04:12.719
No, but there was
a pretty hostile text exchange.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.654
It was about an hour
before the murder

04:14.722 --> 04:17.390
[from someone named Lucy.
Something about Franca leaving.]

04:17.458 --> 04:20.291
[No death threats, but I got to say, but
these ladies were not in a good place.]

04:20.360 --> 04:22.327
Can you identify her,
track her down?

04:22.395 --> 04:24.997
Her geo-tagging's off,
but I can trace her old-school.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.699
[Just give me a second.]
No luck finding Burrows.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.136
Well, prominent people
with money and influence,

04:30.203 --> 04:32.138
maybe someone
was after them both.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.640
OK, I got it. Franca's BBM
hater was a Lucy Estevez.

04:35.707 --> 04:37.642
It was her partner
in a real estate firm.

04:37.709 --> 04:39.844
All right, break the news
in confidence

04:39.912 --> 04:42.180
to her, Dev, and bring her in
for a little chat.

04:45.751 --> 04:49.053
Well, he found
her business partner.

04:49.121 --> 04:51.689
We don't want Burrows finding
out about this on the news.

04:51.757 --> 04:53.924
- Whoa! What are you doing here?
- Oh, come on!

04:53.992 --> 04:56.927
I just outfoxed six
of Toronto's finest for this.

04:56.995 --> 04:59.330
- That's Franca Burrows, isn't it?
- What are you? A reporter?

04:59.398 --> 05:01.899
Mindreader. With a police
scanner in my car.

05:01.966 --> 05:03.934
Tia Tremblay, crime desk,
<i>Daily Record.</i>

05:04.002 --> 05:06.270
This is the part where
I neither confirm nor deny--

05:06.337 --> 05:09.472
- What if I have a hot tip that could
blow this thing wide open for you?

05:09.540 --> 05:12.141
- What is she doing in here?
- Oh, Mr. Klein,

05:12.209 --> 05:14.477
Tia Tremblay for
the <i>Daily Record.</i> I'm a big fan.

05:14.545 --> 05:16.813
Show her the way out.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.316
So much for the freedom
of the press.

05:19.383 --> 05:21.217
The victim's husband doesn't even
know she's dead yet. Back off.

05:21.285 --> 05:23.719
But heaven forbid, I miss
your photo op at the perp walk.

05:25.855 --> 05:27.956
Come on.

05:28.024 --> 05:31.026
- Did you say anything to her?
- No.

05:31.093 --> 05:34.062
Good. Flacks like that will do
anything to make the front page.

05:36.566 --> 05:38.533
Hey, Oz, who do we have here?

05:38.600 --> 05:41.001
Ah! He looks exactly
like Glen Suitor.

05:41.069 --> 05:43.971
- Who?
- TSN?

05:44.039 --> 05:47.542
- Oh, my God! 89 Grey Cup?
- Rider pride.

05:47.609 --> 05:50.478
He got blindsided by 600 pounds
of Argonaut defensive line.

05:50.546 --> 05:53.080
No broken bones, but I gave him
a little something for the pain.

05:53.148 --> 05:55.949
Did we get that on camera? I'd
like to see a replay of that hit.

05:56.016 --> 05:57.917
Ha, he's made that joke
a few times already.

05:57.985 --> 05:59.953
Well, he's stable, so...

06:00.020 --> 06:02.021
- let's get him a CT and X-ray.
- OK, coming up.

06:02.089 --> 06:05.425
Thank you.

06:05.493 --> 06:07.427
- Oz?
- What?

06:07.495 --> 06:09.563
You just saved
a Grey Cup champion's life.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.531
Hey, you know, just gotta take it one
day at a time. Do it for the team.

06:12.599 --> 06:15.701
Leave it all in the field.
It's gut check time.

06:15.769 --> 06:18.937
- Are you done?
- Homerun! Here's the "swish"!

06:19.005 --> 06:21.039
- OK...
- Thanks, coach.

06:21.107 --> 06:23.776
OK, I got it.
Kyle's on the red-eye.

06:23.844 --> 06:26.544
We'll be waiting for him
at his house when he gets there.

06:26.612 --> 06:29.381
I'm sorry.
I can't believe this is real.

06:29.448 --> 06:31.282
I should wake up from this.

06:31.350 --> 06:34.018
She'll call.
It will be a bad dream.

06:34.086 --> 06:37.021
When was the last time
that you spoke with Franca?

06:37.089 --> 06:39.457
Oh, we were texting last night.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.426
Right up until the murder.

06:41.494 --> 06:44.127
I thought she was giving me
the silent treatment.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.663
What exactly were these two
of you fighting about?

06:46.731 --> 06:48.732
Nothing, it was stupid. Work.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.134
According to your text
message conversation,

06:51.202 --> 06:54.438
she said, "Leave me alone.
I've had it. I'm out."

06:54.506 --> 06:57.274
And then you said, "If you screw
with me on this, you're done!"

06:57.341 --> 06:59.675
The rest of the conversation,
it doesn't get any better.

06:59.743 --> 07:01.644
It was about a job.
We were both exhausted

07:01.712 --> 07:04.414
and losing it a bit.

07:04.481 --> 07:07.683
Look...

07:07.751 --> 07:10.720
we've been friends
since kindergarten. Franca...

07:12.689 --> 07:15.857
...she was a little sister
I never had.

07:15.925 --> 07:18.760
No secrets, no punches pulled.

07:18.828 --> 07:21.162
I loved that about us,
and so did she.

07:21.230 --> 07:24.032
Really? Because it sounds like Franca
was ready to end your partnership.

07:24.099 --> 07:26.134
Idle threats on both sides.

07:26.201 --> 07:28.470
We were invited to bid
on a waterfront development.

07:28.538 --> 07:31.772
I wanted it, and she felt
it was anti-environment.

07:31.840 --> 07:35.009
And how did the two of you usually
resolve these disagreements?

07:35.077 --> 07:37.245
A long weekend at a spa.

07:40.049 --> 07:42.350
We always worked things out.

07:42.418 --> 07:45.987
My head for business and her
big, sweet, bleeding heart.

07:46.055 --> 07:48.755
Oh, my God,
we were a great team.

07:48.823 --> 07:51.791
She had her inheritance
to fall back on.

07:51.859 --> 07:53.860
You needed this business
to work.

07:53.928 --> 07:56.163
The company was her baby.
Franca was the name,

07:56.230 --> 07:59.433
she was the draw. I was
just lucky to be a part of it.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.869
I had no incentive
to want her dead...

08:02.937 --> 08:04.870
if that's what you're implying.

08:04.938 --> 08:06.738
Do you know anyone who did?

08:06.806 --> 08:09.741
- Where was she?
- The Distillery District.

08:09.809 --> 08:13.145
I had this feeling that she started
seeing someone who lived in that area.

08:13.213 --> 08:16.215
Like an affair?

08:16.283 --> 08:19.784
- Do you have a name?
- I wouldn't. Franca was the soul of discretion.

08:19.852 --> 08:22.120
Do you think her husband could
have known something about this?

08:22.188 --> 08:24.422
Kyle works as hard as she does.

08:24.490 --> 08:27.525
Look, if she was cheating
on him...

08:27.593 --> 08:29.494
it would have been
out of loneliness.

08:29.561 --> 08:32.097
They barely saw one another.

08:32.164 --> 08:34.631
They were both so busy.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.167
OK. Thank you.

08:39.437 --> 08:41.438
We're very sorry
for your loss, Mr. Burrows.

08:41.506 --> 08:43.907
Franca was like Lady Di.

08:43.975 --> 08:46.943
People adored her.

08:47.012 --> 08:49.313
- I want to make sense of this.
- Well, the first thing

08:49.381 --> 08:52.315
we can do is find whoever's
responsible for this.

08:52.383 --> 08:54.283
Yes.

08:54.351 --> 08:57.453
Sorry.

08:57.521 --> 09:01.024
- How can I be of help?
- Did Franca have any enemies?

09:01.091 --> 09:03.092
Any business rivals?

09:03.160 --> 09:05.194
Someone who was upset
by a property deal?

09:05.262 --> 09:07.529
Not that I was aware of.

09:07.596 --> 09:11.133
How about any personal issues?

09:11.200 --> 09:14.302
Big money and fame don't tend
to bring out the best in people.

09:14.370 --> 09:16.004
We were happy and healthy.

09:16.072 --> 09:18.040
In love.

09:18.107 --> 09:20.509
We had everything we wanted
from life, from each other.

09:20.576 --> 09:23.444
So there was no outside
romantic interest?

09:23.512 --> 09:25.946
What are you saying?

09:26.014 --> 09:29.116
- Our marriage was very strong.
- Franca was meeting someone

09:29.184 --> 09:32.486
for dinner close to where she was killed.
Do you know who she was meeting?

09:34.956 --> 09:37.658
Franca worked day and night
on top of her charities.

09:39.726 --> 09:41.727
We were both so busy,

09:41.795 --> 09:43.996
I admit
I don't know her schedule.

09:44.065 --> 09:46.132
I've been away.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.602
- Oh, yeah, that's right. Where were you exactly?
- Newfoundland.

09:49.670 --> 09:53.073
- I was in transit most of the night.
- Well...

09:53.140 --> 09:56.341
we'll be in touch
if we have any more information.

09:56.409 --> 09:58.944
Again, we're very sorry
for your loss.

09:59.011 --> 10:01.046
Just get the monster
who did this.

10:01.114 --> 10:03.115
That's right, we will.

10:03.183 --> 10:05.850
I mean, whoever could have done
this was definitely a monster.

10:16.962 --> 10:20.064
Are you sure you're OK?

10:20.132 --> 10:22.200
Is there someone we can call?

10:22.267 --> 10:24.302
Thanks, but...

10:26.805 --> 10:28.738
...I want to be alone.

10:28.806 --> 10:30.701
OK.

10:47.916 --> 10:50.951
Well, we'll go through his alibi
with a fine toothcomb,

10:51.018 --> 10:52.259
but if what you saw
is really what happened, then--

10:52.379 --> 10:54.600
- I know what I saw.
- Sergeant McCluskey, Mr. Logan.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.575
- How did you get up here?
- My sources tell me

10:56.695 --> 10:59.765
you were back at the Burrows' place today.
Am I right? Is Kyle a suspect?

10:59.884 --> 11:03.386
- The media desk, 2nd floor.
- The "no comment" office. Yeah, I've been there.

11:03.453 --> 11:06.322
- They know less than I do.
- Make sure she gets out of here.

11:06.390 --> 11:07.923
I will. I'll be right there.

11:07.991 --> 11:11.560
How about you, Mr. Logan?
Comment? It might be worth

11:11.628 --> 11:13.562
- your while.
- OK, you know what?

11:13.630 --> 11:15.697
Ambushing us is not the best way
to get what you want.

11:15.765 --> 11:18.166
Want to give me a crash course
in communicating? How sweet.

11:18.234 --> 11:21.169
This is the 2nd time you said you had
something for us. What is it? Shoot.

11:23.739 --> 11:27.341
Quid pro quo?

11:27.409 --> 11:30.944
You know what? If what
you have is worth it, maybe.

11:31.012 --> 11:33.080
Not exactly starting
from a place of mutual trust,

11:33.148 --> 11:35.282
are we, Toby?

11:38.953 --> 11:42.256
All right, you know what? I
don't have time for these games.

11:42.323 --> 11:45.591
Games, hey! Whoa.
How come you quit being a medic?

11:45.659 --> 11:48.361
- I didn't.
- And how come whatever it is you do, never gets entered

11:48.429 --> 11:50.329
into IIB's evidence against
the accused in any trial?

11:50.397 --> 11:52.898
Because it's never any good,
OK? You're reading our cases?

11:52.966 --> 11:56.135
I'm doing my research.
Wanna comment now?

11:56.203 --> 11:58.237
I can't tell if you're serious.

11:58.305 --> 12:01.440
Can you make sure
she gets out of here, please?

12:01.507 --> 12:05.043
Thanks anyway.

12:05.111 --> 12:07.145
Kyle Burrows was mid-flight
from Newfoundland

12:07.213 --> 12:09.881
when Franca was killed. I got
five statements to confirm it.

12:09.949 --> 12:13.185
Apparently, the offshore drilling
boom in the North Atlantic

12:13.252 --> 12:15.420
needs wireless solutions,
and he's their go-to guy.

12:15.488 --> 12:17.521
So his alibi is clear
for the whole week?

12:17.589 --> 12:20.958
Yeah. He had back-to-back meetings. Most
of his time was spent on an oilrig.

12:21.025 --> 12:24.027
- He was really only alone when he slept.
- I saw him do it.

12:24.096 --> 12:26.763
- Maybe he thought about it.
- No.

12:26.831 --> 12:29.100
I double-checked
for anything to indicate

12:29.167 --> 12:32.069
that he could have hired someone to do it.
I checked his personal accounts,

12:32.137 --> 12:33.970
his business expenses.
There was nothing out or order,

12:34.037 --> 12:36.172
especially no hitman-size
money going out.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.541
Yeah, because
he did it himself.

12:38.609 --> 12:40.343
You said yourself, sometimes
you read people's intentions.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.579
Not this time.
It was too sharp.

12:42.646 --> 12:44.547
It was too detailed.
He killed her.

12:44.615 --> 12:48.451
What about her business
partner, Lucy Estevez?

12:48.519 --> 12:50.352
Her alibi is soft.

12:50.420 --> 12:53.122
I mean, she was at home,
working alone.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.458
She claims that her and Franca were
like sisters, but I'm not sold.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.460
But she did say
that she thought

12:58.528 --> 13:00.496
that Franca might
have had a lover.

13:00.563 --> 13:02.531
Maybe she just wants us
looking elsewhere.

13:02.599 --> 13:04.699
Possibly. I'm checking
with their mutual friends,

13:04.767 --> 13:07.502
business contacts to see just
how real that "sisters" act is.

13:07.569 --> 13:11.005
Oh! As for who Franca
fought with at the bistro,

13:11.072 --> 13:13.441
I checked the name
of the reservation

13:13.509 --> 13:15.976
and came up with this:
Thomas Szabo.

13:16.044 --> 13:17.945
Who is this?
Who's Thomas Szabo?

13:18.013 --> 13:20.114
It's a local architect.
He's got some co-ventures

13:20.182 --> 13:22.949
with Franca's firm.
He has no criminal record.

13:23.017 --> 13:25.051
OK, Dev, you keep
digging on Lucy.

13:25.119 --> 13:27.787
You and I are going to go talk
to this Szabo.

13:27.855 --> 13:30.857
OK.

13:30.924 --> 13:32.825
Me and Franca?

13:32.893 --> 13:34.727
Who said that?

13:34.795 --> 13:37.329
So you two
weren't involved?

13:37.397 --> 13:41.099
Professionally. She single-
handedly put my work on the map.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.569
She was my muse and patron,
but not my lover.

13:50.510 --> 13:54.345
So, you met outside of work,
maybe had dinner last night?

13:54.413 --> 13:56.414
She wanted to review
the timelines

13:56.482 --> 13:58.449
on a new project, yes.

13:58.517 --> 14:01.519
- How did that go?
- We argued.

14:01.587 --> 14:04.489
She walked out. 
<i>I warned her this would happen.</i>

14:04.557 --> 14:06.624
<i>I should have stayed</i>
<i>the hell away from her.</i>

14:06.692 --> 14:09.326
We know you didn't argue
about deadlines.

14:09.394 --> 14:11.328
You were arguing
about your relationship.

14:11.396 --> 14:13.230
You were lovers.

14:13.298 --> 14:16.099
We got closer during
the time we worked together.

14:16.167 --> 14:19.570
Last night...

14:19.637 --> 14:22.439
I should have kept my mouth shut. I
crossed the line and said something.

14:22.507 --> 14:24.441
- About money?
- About Kyle.

14:24.509 --> 14:27.776
They seemed to be having
some problems.

14:27.844 --> 14:31.247
I was trying to be supportive.

14:31.315 --> 14:33.282
I should have walked her
to her car.

14:33.350 --> 14:36.919
- But you didn't.
- I went for a few drinks.

14:36.986 --> 14:40.022
I don't know
when I got in or how.

14:40.090 --> 14:43.157
I know that makes me
a suspect, but...

14:43.226 --> 14:45.393
I would never have hurt her.

14:48.163 --> 14:51.132
- OK. We'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

14:54.903 --> 14:57.738
His grief for Franca is genuine.
I don't get him killing her.

14:57.805 --> 15:01.375
They were having an affair. If she told him she
wasn't leaving her husband, he could have gone

15:01.443 --> 15:04.545
- into a rage.
- He wanted her to leave Kyle.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.980
And did I mention
that Kyle is the killer?

15:07.048 --> 15:09.450
- What's going on with you?
- All right. This reporter,

15:09.517 --> 15:12.953
she said that she has something that we could use.
Maybe we should talk to her.

15:13.020 --> 15:15.888
- What did you get from her?
- I didn't get anything.

15:15.956 --> 15:18.124
- I can't read her.
- You can't read her?

15:18.191 --> 15:20.126
- You tried?
- Of course.

15:20.193 --> 15:22.295
She seemed sincere, so...

15:24.365 --> 15:26.999
Toby, no, that's a hook.
That's how they get you to talk.

15:27.067 --> 15:30.101
Obviously, she doesn't need one
for you, though.

15:30.169 --> 15:32.704
Oh! Dev says Franca and Lucy

15:32.772 --> 15:34.839
had partnership insurance.

15:34.907 --> 15:37.242
One dies,
the other gets her stake.

15:37.310 --> 15:39.444
Franca was worth 6 million.

15:39.512 --> 15:41.413
- Uh.
- Sounds like motive.

15:41.481 --> 15:43.948
It's a common thing.

15:44.016 --> 15:45.883
Franca's lawyers advised us
to get the insurance

15:45.950 --> 15:48.085
in case of accidents.

15:48.153 --> 15:51.422
- Right, like if one of you got murdered.
- Do I need a lawyer? Because

15:51.490 --> 15:54.358
- you guys are way off base here.
- You two were at each other's throats.

15:54.426 --> 15:57.161
I already told the other
detective, it wasn't like that.

15:57.228 --> 16:00.631
But maybe you wanted her share of the business,
so you could run it the way you wanted to.

16:00.699 --> 16:02.699
<i>I wanted her</i>
<i>to be happy...</i>

16:02.767 --> 16:06.102
for once in her miserable life.

16:06.170 --> 16:09.673
Or maybe you wanted
to help her out of a bad spot.

16:09.740 --> 16:11.941
You knew she was miserable.

16:15.479 --> 16:18.447
Even little rich girls
get abused.

16:18.515 --> 16:20.683
Franca grew up
as a princess, but...

16:20.750 --> 16:24.152
Kyle beat that out of her.

16:24.220 --> 16:26.822
You're saying
that Kyle abused her?

16:26.889 --> 16:29.057
She always swore
he never hit her.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.293
He didn't have to.

16:31.361 --> 16:33.894
He broke her
in a 100 other ways.

16:33.962 --> 16:35.896
So why didn't you
say this before?

16:35.964 --> 16:37.898
I said

16:37.966 --> 16:40.635
Franca cared
about her reputation...

16:40.703 --> 16:42.637
which was linked to Kyle's.

16:42.705 --> 16:45.440
So what?
She was embarrassed, ashamed?

16:45.507 --> 16:48.443
She made me swear
that I wouldn't tell a soul

16:48.510 --> 16:51.345
that Kyle was anything
but perfect.

16:51.412 --> 16:53.680
She didn't want to be pitied...

16:53.748 --> 16:55.682
she wanted a way out.

16:55.750 --> 16:58.985
<i>Abusive husband</i>

16:59.053 --> 17:00.987
killing his cheating wife.

17:01.055 --> 17:03.957
Is it starting to sound
like a story that you buy?

17:04.023 --> 17:06.992
I'll just wait for the DNA
to get back in from the lab.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.628
I know he did it.
This is not about the DNA.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.298
This is about you guys
not trusting what I do.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.672
- Toby.
- So one possibly

17:19.740 --> 17:22.306
unreadable girl,
and I'm unreliable.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.943
I need more than a read,
I need proof.

17:44.863 --> 17:47.398
Yeah, look, I could get
in trouble for seeing you.

17:47.465 --> 17:49.633
You wanted to know

17:49.701 --> 17:53.069
why my work at IIB is never in
any of the case records, right?

17:53.137 --> 17:55.938
- Yeah.
- OK. Behavioural evidence

17:56.006 --> 17:59.475
is easily dismissed in court.

17:59.543 --> 18:01.577
What's on record is the results,

18:01.645 --> 18:03.746
the hard evidence.
That's what sticks.

18:05.816 --> 18:08.017
So tit for that,
what have you got on Burrows?

18:10.119 --> 18:12.153
A few months back,
I was at this gala

18:12.221 --> 18:14.656
on a tax fraud story,
and Kyle and Franca

18:14.724 --> 18:17.258
were out back after,
on their own. He was drunk,

18:17.326 --> 18:19.428
screaming at her.

18:19.495 --> 18:21.663
He slapped her. The cops came,

18:21.731 --> 18:23.598
she wouldn't press charges.

18:23.666 --> 18:25.733
And there's no record
of that with Metro?

18:25.801 --> 18:28.368
I checked. Nothing.

18:28.437 --> 18:30.270
My editors wouldn't run it
out of fear of Kyle,

18:30.338 --> 18:33.541
but now I know
I should have pressed harder.

18:33.608 --> 18:36.911
So, that's it?
That's what you got?

18:36.978 --> 18:39.379
- Yeah.
- OK.

18:42.750 --> 18:46.486
So you're saying
this incident never took place?

18:46.554 --> 18:49.789
Absolutely. I would never hit
a woman, let alone Franca.

18:49.857 --> 18:51.825
So why three separate
sources told us

18:51.892 --> 18:54.627
your marriage was in trouble?

18:54.695 --> 18:57.697
<i>You were never here! You don't
want to be in this marriage!</i>

18:57.765 --> 19:00.299
Listen to me!
Just be here when I get back!

19:05.372 --> 19:07.306
We had an arrangement.

19:07.374 --> 19:09.708
And discretion was key.

19:09.776 --> 19:13.346
If she cried on any shoulders
about it, it was news to me.

19:13.413 --> 19:16.047
Well, jealous lovers could be

19:16.115 --> 19:18.450
potential suspects. We're gonna
need to talk to them.

19:18.517 --> 19:20.452
I was never with anyone
for long enough for them

19:20.519 --> 19:22.687
to be jealous.

19:22.754 --> 19:25.623
As for anyone
she may have been with...

19:25.691 --> 19:28.393
we never discussed names
or details.

19:28.461 --> 19:31.428
Just a lot easier to save
your breath and kill her.

19:44.543 --> 19:48.244
Sergeant, you and your partner
are no longer welcome here.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.881
Now, if you'll excuse me,

19:50.948 --> 19:52.983
I have a funeral to arrange.

20:00.958 --> 20:02.925
- What the hell was that?
- I saw it again.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.293
I saw him lunge at her.

20:12.035 --> 20:14.837
Look, you just can't accuse
a grieving husband

20:14.905 --> 20:18.407
of killing his wife when there's no
proof, and he has an airtight alibi.

20:18.474 --> 20:20.975
He did it. I saw him do it.
That's my proof.

20:21.044 --> 20:23.245
And that's not how it works.
Toby, you know that.

20:23.312 --> 20:25.247
OK, so maybe
I went at this guy too hard,

20:25.314 --> 20:28.383
too quickly,
but I know he's guilty.

20:28.451 --> 20:30.752
Burrows has the kind of money
that buys friends

20:30.819 --> 20:34.122
in high places. I'm sure he was on the
phone the minute we walked out the door.

20:34.190 --> 20:37.091
All right,
so what happens next?

20:37.159 --> 20:39.126
Now, we have to make sure

20:39.194 --> 20:41.295
you walk out of this
in one piece.

20:52.092 --> 20:54.693
Toby! Michelle!

20:54.761 --> 20:58.031
My office.

21:02.568 --> 21:05.537
- What's up?
- You had an unauthorised conversation

21:05.604 --> 21:07.605
with a reporter
from the <i>Daily Record</i> today?

21:07.673 --> 21:11.209
- With Tia, yeah.
- First name basis.

21:11.277 --> 21:13.278
Cozy.

21:13.346 --> 21:15.779
The paper's using the Freedom
of Information Act to put us

21:15.847 --> 21:18.149
- under the microscope.
- I didn't say anything to her.

21:18.216 --> 21:20.284
I'm just going to give you
one warning, OK?

21:20.352 --> 21:22.253
If you talk to the media again,

21:22.321 --> 21:24.255
you're off this case.

21:24.323 --> 21:27.558
Yeah. Sure.

21:35.299 --> 21:38.501
- DNA results are back.
- Yeah? Previous offender?

21:38.569 --> 21:41.171
No, we can rule out
the husband and Lucy Estevez.

21:41.238 --> 21:43.173
Leaving us Thomas Szabo

21:43.240 --> 21:45.175
or a world of persons unknown.

21:45.242 --> 21:47.276
Great. Thanks.

21:47.344 --> 21:49.711
Oh.

21:49.779 --> 21:53.215
- Hey, you, how is it going?
- Liv, hey, uh, well.

21:53.283 --> 21:55.617
Pleasant surprise.
So are you on a case?

21:55.685 --> 21:58.487
Uh, no, unofficial,
below the radar.

21:58.554 --> 22:00.589
- What's going on?
- Well...

22:00.656 --> 22:02.591
something's wrong.
I've got this read

22:02.658 --> 22:04.692
of this husband
killing his wife,

22:04.759 --> 22:07.395
but there's no way
that he could have done it.

22:07.463 --> 22:09.430
And there's this girl...

22:09.498 --> 22:11.665
I've been trying
to read her, nothing.

22:11.733 --> 22:13.634
- Nothing?
- Yeah.

22:13.702 --> 22:15.636
That's new.
How are you feeling?

22:15.704 --> 22:19.539
Like I could use
a self-diagnostic

22:19.607 --> 22:21.875
with someone I trust.

22:26.381 --> 22:29.483
Thank you
for your cooperation, Mr. Szabo.

22:29.550 --> 22:31.151
How long 'til I'm cleared?

22:31.219 --> 22:34.687
We have our lab standing by.

22:34.755 --> 22:37.589
You get that I was with her
that night?

22:37.657 --> 22:39.892
I mean, we hugged, kissed hello.

22:39.959 --> 22:43.695
We're only matching samples that she could
have acquired while defending herself.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.632
I loved her.
I wanted to help her.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.335
- So she was leaving Kyle?
- That was the plan.

22:49.403 --> 22:51.936
He scared her out of it.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.506
You aren't the first to read
our so-called private messages.

22:54.573 --> 22:57.542
Are you saying
that Kyle hacked her phone?

22:57.609 --> 22:59.577
Or one of his tech guys. Yes.

22:59.645 --> 23:02.880
When Kyle found out about us,
he flipped out.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.450
He told her that she, uh...

23:05.518 --> 23:07.718
needed to end it with me,
that she needed

23:07.786 --> 23:09.720
to be home to greet him
when he got back to town

23:09.788 --> 23:11.856
or else.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.825
OK, we're going to need you to stick
around town until we get the results back.

23:20.432 --> 23:22.600
If Kyle hacked her smartphone,

23:22.668 --> 23:26.402
he could track her movements. He'd
know exactly where she was gonna be.

23:26.470 --> 23:30.339
OK. And we're absolutely sure
there are no holes in his alibi?

23:30.407 --> 23:33.543
Yeah. I dug a little deeper
and ran all contracts

23:33.611 --> 23:35.979
that his corporation has entered
into looking for potential

23:36.047 --> 23:38.982
bogus subcontractors.
If he made a deal with somebody

23:39.050 --> 23:41.149
to kill his wife,
I can't find it.

23:43.853 --> 23:46.354
All right,
your grandma's middle name?

23:46.422 --> 23:48.991
Ginette.

23:49.059 --> 23:52.461
Your biggest regret?

23:52.528 --> 23:56.163
- Your father.
- Yeah, missing his funeral.

23:56.231 --> 23:58.232
Toby...

23:58.300 --> 24:01.202
that's 20 out of 20.
You're fine.

24:01.269 --> 24:04.072
Right. So it's got
to be the girl.

24:04.139 --> 24:06.975
Maybe, but we don't know
how it works when it does.

24:07.042 --> 24:09.210
We sure as hell not gonna figure
it out when it doesn't.

24:09.277 --> 24:12.445
I'm open to theories. Uh...

24:12.513 --> 24:14.881
childhood illness,
metal plate in her head.

24:14.949 --> 24:17.951
You're the only one who understands
it when you experience it.

24:18.019 --> 24:20.020
What if I can't anymore?

24:20.088 --> 24:22.089
There's that read
I got wrong from that guy.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.625
Well, maybe that's
something else altogether.

24:24.692 --> 24:27.360
- What do you mean?
- Maybe it isn't the read

24:27.428 --> 24:30.963
- itself, but your interpretation of it.
- Look, it wasn't an imagining

24:31.031 --> 24:33.565
or an intention. This was
a memory, a recollection.

24:33.634 --> 24:37.503
I'm sorry, Toby. Short
of tracking what's going on,

24:37.570 --> 24:39.672
detecting patterns, triggers...

24:39.740 --> 24:43.408
- Thanks.
- You're OK, that's what matters.

24:47.013 --> 24:50.448
What do you mean
you can't?

24:50.516 --> 24:52.550
I can't hear her thoughts.

24:52.618 --> 24:55.219
I can't see
what's inside of her head.

24:55.287 --> 24:57.421
She just smiles,
and I see nothing.

24:57.489 --> 25:00.058
- Oh, so you like her?
- Yeah, right up until

25:00.126 --> 25:02.893
- she got Klein pissed of at me.
- Wait, I thought the guy

25:02.961 --> 25:04.928
who didn't kill his wife
got Klein pissed of at you.

25:04.996 --> 25:06.830
I don't know, man, I've been
trying to figure this thing out

25:06.898 --> 25:08.866
my whole life. I finally do,

25:08.933 --> 25:12.102
and I got a purpose
for it, and...

25:12.171 --> 25:14.305
now it abandons me.

25:14.373 --> 25:16.339
I mean, for those of us
who can't read people

25:16.407 --> 25:18.941
like an open book, unexpected
surprises happen all the time.

25:19.009 --> 25:21.778
- Right.
- Does every thought you have solve a case?

25:21.845 --> 25:24.781
- No.
- But they still hired you anyway.

25:24.848 --> 25:27.450
Look, if I can't trust myself,
they can't trust me.

25:27.518 --> 25:30.620
Well, Toby,
I mean, this ability

25:30.688 --> 25:32.821
to read minds
that you have is incredible,

25:32.889 --> 25:35.224
but the greatest gift
is what it's already given you.

25:35.292 --> 25:37.426
And you know how to read people.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.928
You know people inside and out.

25:39.996 --> 25:43.131
This guy Kyle, man,
he wanted his wife dead.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.268
I could feel him doing it,
he enjoyed it.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.369
So trust that.

25:48.437 --> 25:51.806
Maybe you don't know how he did
it yet, but you know he did it.

25:51.873 --> 25:55.076
So stick with it.
Get deeper into his head.

26:03.819 --> 26:06.520
You're in a rush?
Something holding you back,

26:06.588 --> 26:09.756
weighing you down?
Maybe a conscience?

26:09.824 --> 26:12.759
- I said I'm done talking to you.
- I know a lot about you,

26:12.827 --> 26:15.795
- a lot more than you think.
- Get out of here.

26:15.863 --> 26:18.765
Yeah, I've seen what happens when
someone turns their back on you, Kyle.

26:20.834 --> 26:23.336
I know you killed her. She was
leaving you for someone else,

26:23.403 --> 26:24.670
and you couldn't handle that.

26:24.738 --> 26:26.339
Leave me alone
or I will have your badge.

26:26.406 --> 26:28.307
Yeah, let me take you
back there.

26:28.375 --> 26:30.643
You snuck up on her.

26:30.711 --> 26:32.978
You concealed your weapon
'til you're right on top of her.

26:33.046 --> 26:35.013
- All right, that's enough.
- She had her back to you.

26:35.081 --> 26:37.482
You got this surge of
adrenaline, you can't wait.

26:59.271 --> 27:01.938
You're insane.

27:02.006 --> 27:05.709
You haven't heard
the end of this.

27:26.260 --> 27:29.395
- Leave it on.
- What's going on?

27:29.463 --> 27:31.731
I just received this court
order denying our unit

27:31.798 --> 27:34.800
- further access to Kyle Burrows.
- Because we're on to him.

27:34.868 --> 27:37.137
Tia Tremblay saw Kyle
physically hurt Franca.

27:37.204 --> 27:40.106
- I was just following up on that.
- Tia again.

27:40.173 --> 27:43.542
- Yeah.
- You got this from reading her?

27:43.610 --> 27:46.178
- I can't read her.
- Can't?

27:46.246 --> 27:48.981
What do you mean "can't"?

27:49.049 --> 27:52.151
- You knew about this?
- This is the first time it happened.

27:52.218 --> 27:54.286
Tia is not relevant
to our investigation.

27:54.354 --> 27:57.155
Keeping secrets and covering for one
another's screw-ups absolutely is.

27:57.222 --> 28:00.258
- This woman is a shark!
- She's not, and she didn't get anything.

28:00.325 --> 28:03.094
She could sink all our careers.

28:03.162 --> 28:05.396
In light of the fact
that your abilities seem to be

28:05.464 --> 28:07.398
malfunctioning, not to mention
your judgement, you're

28:07.466 --> 28:09.500
off this case and relieved
of duty until further notice.

28:19.544 --> 28:21.645
- Was that really necessary?
- Well, had to be done.

28:21.713 --> 28:23.981
- Not like that.
- He's lucky I only took him

28:24.049 --> 28:26.016
off the case,
not out of the whole damn unit.

28:26.084 --> 28:29.218
- Well, without Toby, there isn't a unit.
- Let me assure you,

28:29.286 --> 28:31.453
we are well on our way to that
being the situation anyway.

28:31.521 --> 28:34.190
Toby confronted Kyle Burrows
on his own property

28:34.257 --> 28:37.026
without permission. I just spent
the last hour on the phone with

28:37.094 --> 28:39.428
Superintendent Price putting out
that particular fire.

28:39.496 --> 28:41.564
Toby is sure
that Burrows is responsible.

28:41.631 --> 28:43.598
With the state
of his gift right now,

28:43.666 --> 28:45.701
his opinion means nothing.

28:45.768 --> 28:48.103
- He made a mistake.
- He's made multiple mistakes:

28:48.171 --> 28:51.506
talking to the press, inaccurate
reads, or worse, no reads at all.

28:51.574 --> 28:54.743
If we can't trust his ability,
then he's a liability, period.

28:54.811 --> 28:57.478
- What if he's right?
- You have Logan's back.

28:57.546 --> 28:59.747
- This isn't about loyalty.
- Burrows' alibi

28:59.848 --> 29:03.483
is airtight. His DNA
was not a match.

29:03.551 --> 29:06.187
I'm aware of all of that,
but Toby and his abilities,

29:06.254 --> 29:08.155
they've earned my trust.
And I'm not gonna go back

29:08.223 --> 29:11.025
on that because of one or
two mistakes in this one case.

29:11.093 --> 29:13.627
This one case?
The high profile nature

29:13.695 --> 29:16.129
of the victim, we're already
under increased scrutiny.

29:16.197 --> 29:18.131
I can't have a member
of this team,

29:18.199 --> 29:21.034
any member, acting outside
the chain of command.

29:21.102 --> 29:23.937
If he can't play by the rules,
I can't protect him.

29:24.004 --> 29:25.972
I'll talk to him.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.007
Later. We still have
a murder to solve,

29:28.075 --> 29:30.210
and we're a man short.

29:49.361 --> 29:52.496
- Hey.
- Hey. You're a dangerous man to be around right now.

29:52.564 --> 29:54.565
- Why is that?
- Kyle's lawyers

29:54.633 --> 29:56.801
are all after Klein.
He's disavowing

29:56.869 --> 29:59.703
- all responsibility for your actions.
- That's a mistake.

29:59.772 --> 30:01.906
Going after someone
as powerful as Kyle

30:01.974 --> 30:04.841
on your own, that is a mistake.

30:04.909 --> 30:06.977
I'm just trying
to save the team.

30:07.044 --> 30:09.345
- What do you think?
- I think whatever you said

30:09.413 --> 30:11.882
must have scared
the hell out of Burrows.

30:11.949 --> 30:14.617
Hmm... I thought
my read was off,

30:14.685 --> 30:16.787
but it wasn't,
it was just incomplete.

30:16.854 --> 30:18.721
So I went there
to get more, and I did.

30:18.789 --> 30:20.923
I got a clock,

30:20.991 --> 30:22.925
I heard a steam whistle...

30:22.993 --> 30:24.927
and I got Kyle cutting
a blonde woman's throat

30:24.995 --> 30:27.696
with a knife.
It wasn't Franca.

30:29.966 --> 30:31.934
- So two blondes?
- Uh-huh.

30:32.002 --> 30:34.103
Do you have any idea
who she was?

30:34.171 --> 30:37.172
No, but he killed her.

30:37.239 --> 30:39.140
Yeah, they must be connected.

30:41.576 --> 30:44.578
- What's going on with the DNA?
- Szabo and Lucy are cleared,

30:44.646 --> 30:47.982
but we know that Kyle found out about the affair.
He threatened Franca.

30:48.050 --> 30:50.384
But he didn't kill her.
Someone else did.

30:50.452 --> 30:53.353
Whoever Kyle killed
is the key to this.

30:53.421 --> 30:55.588
- OK, I will look into it.
- Good.

30:55.656 --> 30:58.425
Which means you won't.
The only way we're gonna

30:58.492 --> 31:01.261
get you back at the IIB
is by nailing Kyle by the book.

31:01.329 --> 31:03.964
All right. Got it.

31:21.448 --> 31:23.414
These ambushes are getting
a little old, aren't they?

31:23.482 --> 31:26.184
I called your office.
I know what personal leave means

31:26.252 --> 31:28.553
I'm sorry if anything I said
got you into trouble.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.622
The access of information stuff
was my editor. OK?

31:31.690 --> 31:33.691
He golfs with Kyle Burrows. He
knew I was at the crime scene.

31:33.759 --> 31:36.161
He asked me who was working it.
I didn't realise he was looking

31:36.229 --> 31:38.396
for an angle to come
after you or your team.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.533
You have no reason to trust me,
so maybe I can give you one.

31:43.601 --> 31:45.535
You like anything in here,
it's yours.

31:45.603 --> 31:48.305
We both know Kyle Burrows
is behind his wife's murder.

31:48.373 --> 31:51.942
The thing is he didn't get his hands
dirty, he had someone do it for him.

31:52.010 --> 31:54.611
Yeah, well, the evidence
does not support that.

31:54.679 --> 31:56.746
Rich people meet
a lot of desperate people.

31:56.813 --> 31:59.615
It's too risky.
He chooses the wrong guy,

31:59.683 --> 32:02.051
the whole thing
blows up in his face.

32:02.119 --> 32:04.854
- Or he keeps coming back to
haunt him: blackmail, extortion.

32:04.922 --> 32:07.556
That's a tough role to cast.

32:07.624 --> 32:10.626
It requires a type of trust
that Kyle cannot give.

32:10.694 --> 32:12.827
But the world is his oyster.

32:12.896 --> 32:15.931
His personal travel itineraries.

32:15.999 --> 32:18.166
Don't ask, just listen.

32:18.234 --> 32:20.402
Kyle was in Vancouver
three weeks ago.

32:20.469 --> 32:24.006
He was booked as the keynote
speaker at a tech conference.

32:24.073 --> 32:26.074
He bailed the last two days
of the conference.

32:26.142 --> 32:29.176
OK, so something came up.

32:29.244 --> 32:32.579
The man has never missed a date
with the limelight in his life.

32:32.647 --> 32:35.116
He fell off the grid
for two days.

32:35.183 --> 32:38.286
That time could have been spent
finding a hitman to kill his wife.

32:38.353 --> 32:41.222
Buying a birthday gift.
Maybe he met a woman.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.623
Another reason
to check out Vancouver.

32:43.690 --> 32:46.759
If he goes
with a non-local hitman,

32:46.827 --> 32:50.163
it would make it harder to trace a connection
back to him. What have you got, Logan?

32:50.231 --> 32:53.666
I don't know. I don't know.
But if I get something,

32:53.734 --> 32:57.103
then I promise you,
you'll get the exclusive.

32:57.171 --> 32:59.405
Thank you, Tia.

33:03.109 --> 33:05.911
This isn't enough.

33:05.979 --> 33:08.247
Yeah.

33:08.315 --> 33:10.682
Kyle killed that woman in
Vancouver about three weeks ago

33:10.750 --> 33:12.952
near that antique steam clock
in Gastown.

33:13.019 --> 33:14.986
Toby, I told you
to stay away from him.

33:15.054 --> 33:17.121
[No, this is from Tia
who did not come after us.]

33:17.189 --> 33:19.357
It was her editor
who is a friend of Kyle's.

33:19.425 --> 33:22.460
- From Tia? Toby--
- [Can you just look into it?]

33:22.527 --> 33:24.495
If she's pulling something,
we'll both know.

33:24.563 --> 33:26.530
I can't tell on my own.

33:26.598 --> 33:28.532
It just goes along
with what I got from Kyle.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.435
OK, I'll have Dev look into it.

33:30.502 --> 33:33.536
[Look, Klein's out for a few
hours on some depositions.]

33:33.604 --> 33:35.439
<i>I checked Kyle's</i>

33:35.506 --> 33:37.540
travel itinerary against
recent homicides in Vancouver.

33:37.608 --> 33:40.310
There were four,
but only one of them in Gastown

33:40.378 --> 33:42.667
that matched the hours
that Kyle vanished that day.

33:42.787 --> 33:46.049
- Hey, this is the girl that Kyle killed.
- "Brigit Lynde.

33:46.084 --> 33:48.351
Cause of death..."

33:48.418 --> 33:50.886
Her throat was slit.

33:55.230 --> 33:57.131
Brigit Lynde,

33:57.199 --> 33:59.667
she's a retail buyer,
married, no kids.

33:59.734 --> 34:01.903
She declared
personal bankruptcy twice.

34:01.946 --> 34:04.781
- So what's the connection to Kyle?
- Maybe one of his lovers.

34:04.849 --> 34:07.218
Maybe. I checked
his client list

34:07.285 --> 34:09.353
and business contacts
and competitors,

34:09.420 --> 34:11.387
I haven't found
a connection yet.

34:11.455 --> 34:14.690
- How about family connections?
- Well, her husband,

34:14.757 --> 34:18.561
Steven Lynde is a publisher. Another
Toronto boy who made it big.

34:18.629 --> 34:22.098
Try connecting Kyle and Lynde, see
if there's any recent contact.

34:28.237 --> 34:30.170
Yeah, there are lots
of connections here.

34:30.239 --> 34:32.873
They went to the same
university, Blake.

34:32.942 --> 34:36.077
They graduated the same year. They
were even in the same frat together.

34:36.145 --> 34:38.179
They graduated ten years ago.

34:38.248 --> 34:41.850
- Check for class reunion.
- What are you thinking? - Have you ever seen

34:41.917 --> 34:44.752
this old Hitchcock film,
<i>Strangers on a Train.</i>

34:44.819 --> 34:48.155
Criss-cross.

34:48.223 --> 34:50.524
So we know that Kyle Burrows
and Steven Lynde

34:50.592 --> 34:53.193
reconnected
at their fraternity reunion.

34:53.262 --> 34:55.730
They agree to swap murders.

34:55.797 --> 34:59.198
Their lives aren't connected to the
victims, so they'll never get caught.

34:59.267 --> 35:02.669
It's a long shot, Michelle.
Reunion could have been

35:02.737 --> 35:04.638
sheer coincidence. And what's
Steven Lynde's motive?

35:04.705 --> 35:07.140
Is there any evidence that
he also wanted his wife dead?

35:07.207 --> 35:09.142
Brigit Lynde told her book club

35:09.209 --> 35:12.044
that he hit her and repeatedly
threatened her life.

35:12.112 --> 35:15.547
- So he's suspect number one.
- Airtight alibi.

35:15.615 --> 35:18.384
Exact same elements as Kyle: both
were travelling, both have witnesses

35:18.451 --> 35:20.386
for every waking hour.

35:20.453 --> 35:22.688
So maybe a little more
than just coincidence.

35:22.756 --> 35:26.091
All of this came from Toby.

35:26.159 --> 35:28.460
You're saying we need him?

35:30.296 --> 35:34.565
I'll work the back channels, get him reinstated.
Get him back on the case as soon as possible.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.142
He's supposed to be resting,
I don't want to bother him.

35:45.210 --> 35:48.144
Don't be nervous.
He wants to meet you.

35:48.212 --> 35:51.981
- He asked me twice. Just go.
- OK, OK.

35:58.155 --> 36:00.524
- Come in.
- Hey, Glen.

36:00.591 --> 36:02.792
It's Oz. I brought you in.

36:02.859 --> 36:04.860
How are you doing? Are
you feeling good, comfortable?

36:04.928 --> 36:08.297
I am now, thanks to you. I want
to thank you for saving my life.

36:08.365 --> 36:10.566
It's a good handshake
you got there.

36:10.634 --> 36:13.602
- I've got something for you.
- Oh, we're not allowed

36:13.670 --> 36:16.672
to accept gifts. I was just doing my job.
That would be unethical, so I can't really--

36:16.740 --> 36:18.773
- Oz, these are VIP

36:18.841 --> 36:20.908
50 yard line seats to the 100th

36:20.976 --> 36:25.179
Grey Cup championship,
and I want you to have 'em.

36:25.247 --> 36:28.783
I'm actually applying for management right
now, so really I got to set a good example.

36:28.851 --> 36:31.686
I hear you. Leadership's important.
It is in football too,

36:31.754 --> 36:33.921
but the guys will think you're
nuts you don't take these.

36:33.989 --> 36:37.391
Yeah, I got a friend who's probably never
gonna want to talk to me again, but I...

36:37.459 --> 36:39.493
Maybe I can just see them.
Can you just

36:39.561 --> 36:43.230
crack that? No! You know, it's fine. Thank you.
Thank you, but I will pass.

36:43.297 --> 36:47.234
Hang on. Hang on a second. Maybe there's
a way we can still work this out.

36:54.008 --> 36:57.710
- Oh, look who's back officially.
- Ooh! Got a keycard.

36:57.778 --> 37:00.881
- All right, very cute, very cute. So what have we got?
- Uh, well, Steven Lynde

37:00.948 --> 37:04.117
is supposed to be at Mont Tremblant
at a literary retreat all week long.

37:04.185 --> 37:06.552
- But he isn't.
- No. According

37:06.620 --> 37:09.621
to his rental car's antitheft system, he's
been in Toronto for the past two days.

37:09.689 --> 37:12.691
- Killing Franca Burrows.
- And there's no record the car was stolen?

37:12.759 --> 37:16.661
- No. So, I have an OPP unit tailing him as we speak.
- Where?

37:16.729 --> 37:18.797
Looks like he's headed
eastbound on highway 401

37:18.865 --> 37:20.832
towards the Don Valley
Parkway junction.

37:20.901 --> 37:23.268
Yeah, he's heading back
to his alibi in Mont Tremblant.

37:23.335 --> 37:25.669
Let's keep eyes on him.

37:25.737 --> 37:27.671
Dev, can you hack

37:27.739 --> 37:30.074
- into Kyle's phone?
- Yeah, piece of cake.

37:33.045 --> 37:35.914
How could you be this stupid?

37:35.981 --> 37:39.783
- What are you doing here?
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TEXTING ME?

37:39.850 --> 37:42.685
I was on my way out of here!
I was free and clear!

37:42.753 --> 37:45.222
We said, "no contact"!

37:45.290 --> 37:48.425
What are you thinking?

37:50.395 --> 37:52.762
I didn't send you this.

37:57.034 --> 37:58.968
So this is what?

37:59.036 --> 38:01.070
- A setup?
- Dude,

38:01.138 --> 38:03.940
- do not flake out on me now.
<i>- Something's going on.</i>

38:04.007 --> 38:05.942
<i>Somebody put us together,</i>
<i>somebody knows!</i>

38:06.009 --> 38:08.677
Calm down.
Let me think about this.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.813
You caved, didn't you!?

38:10.880 --> 38:14.082
I knew that I couldn't trust you!
Would you sell me out for a deal?

38:14.150 --> 38:16.217
Nobody has anything on me,
you idiot.

38:16.285 --> 38:18.219
You must have done something.

38:18.287 --> 38:20.721
We need more.

38:20.789 --> 38:23.591
- Are you wearing a wire?
- Why would I be wearing a wire?

38:23.659 --> 38:25.793
I have more to lose than you do.

38:25.861 --> 38:27.894
You are pulling something,

38:27.963 --> 38:30.497
but I am not going down
for a double murder

38:30.565 --> 38:33.767
alone! This was your idea.

38:33.835 --> 38:35.936
I didn't think you were serious
until you cut my wife's throat

38:36.004 --> 38:38.638
and left her lying
in the garbage.

38:38.706 --> 38:41.241
- Go, go, go, go!
- Go, go, let's move!

38:45.512 --> 38:48.381
- Freeze! IIB!
- Don't move!

38:48.449 --> 38:50.883
- Give it to me.
- Let's go. Get down.

38:50.951 --> 38:52.885
Give me your hands.

38:52.953 --> 38:55.821
We're clear.

39:01.361 --> 39:03.895
That's right. Criss-cross

39:03.963 --> 39:05.964
just like in the movie.

39:06.032 --> 39:09.701
Thank you. It was a team effort.

39:09.768 --> 39:13.038
I can't give away
all our secrets, Jeremy.

39:13.106 --> 39:15.439
I just hope
that your trust is restored,

39:15.507 --> 39:18.209
and that my budget
is fully approved.

39:18.276 --> 39:20.211
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

39:20.278 --> 39:23.381
We'll talk. All right.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.916
- Logan?
- Yeah.

39:27.952 --> 39:30.321
Hey, so I guess you're out
of the doghouse with Price.

39:30.389 --> 39:32.622
Well, he's just
shocked and amazed

39:32.689 --> 39:34.690
that we, once again,

39:34.758 --> 39:36.792
solved the unsolvable crime.

39:36.860 --> 39:39.929
I gotta say half of that
was Kyle's arrogance.

39:39.997 --> 39:42.198
It was more than that.
I need to give credit

39:42.266 --> 39:44.334
where credit is due.
After a shaky start,

39:44.402 --> 39:47.903
you really came through for us.
I'm glad to have you back.

39:47.970 --> 39:50.639
Well, thanks.
Apology accepted.

39:50.706 --> 39:54.209
Oh, no, don't mistake that
for an apology.

39:54.277 --> 39:56.345
I was well within my rights
to remove you

39:56.413 --> 39:59.415
from the investigation, and I
will not hesitate to do it again

39:59.482 --> 40:02.317
if you ever break protocol
like you did today.

40:02.385 --> 40:05.086
- I will keep that in mind.
- Please do.

40:05.154 --> 40:07.455
And in turn, I will try

40:07.523 --> 40:10.291
to better understand
how your...

40:10.359 --> 40:13.161
process works.

40:13.228 --> 40:16.464
Maybe I can give you a little more
leeway in that department in the future.

40:16.532 --> 40:19.967
You know what?
I would appreciate that.

40:20.035 --> 40:22.469
I'll see you tomorrow.
Bright and early.

40:22.537 --> 40:24.838
Sounds good.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.877
<i>The very first Grey Cup game</i>
<i>was played at Rosedale Field</i>

40:29.945 --> 40:32.079
<i>in Toronto in 1909.</i>

40:32.146 --> 40:35.148
<i>And since then, this legendary
symbol of Canadian unity... Hey!</i>

40:35.216 --> 40:37.917
- What are you doing here?
- This is your lucky day.

40:37.985 --> 40:41.955
- It's not my birthday.
- You know, luck isn't even the right word. Blessed.

40:42.022 --> 40:44.824
Cool, what do I do?

40:44.892 --> 40:46.826
Would you just open it please
before I explode.

40:46.894 --> 40:49.028
WHOA! No!

40:49.096 --> 40:51.297
You're kidding me!
Are these real?

40:51.364 --> 40:52.971
- Yep.
- How did you get them?

40:53.091 --> 40:56.401
<i>And on a personal note, I want
to say thank you to Oz Bey</i>

40:56.469 --> 40:59.104
- <i>for coming to my rescue.</i>
<i>- Nooo! Are you kidding me?</i>

40:59.171 --> 41:01.139
- I saved Glen Suitor's life.
- He just said your name!

41:01.207 --> 41:03.075
- Oh, man, you're famous!
- And he gave you those tickets

41:03.142 --> 41:05.043
to take me to Grey Cup 100.

41:05.111 --> 41:07.845
Nice! Good work!

41:07.913 --> 41:09.847
- Yeah.
- Well, I... Oh, hey.

41:09.915 --> 41:12.382
I'm going to probably
not take you actually.

41:12.450 --> 41:15.620
- It's OK, right?
- This is, uh... is this...

41:15.687 --> 41:17.454
This is, yeah.

41:17.522 --> 41:20.524
OK. You know, it's fine.

41:20.592 --> 41:23.027
Are you kidding me?
It's Grey Cup 100, man.

41:23.095 --> 41:25.662
Me and you all the way.

41:25.730 --> 41:28.865
- Nice.
- It's nice, right? Tia, this is Oz. Oz, this is Tia.

41:28.933 --> 41:30.900
- Nice to meet you.
- She's a reporter.

41:30.968 --> 41:33.803
Nice! This just in,
I gotta go.

41:33.871 --> 41:37.273
All right? OK.

41:37.341 --> 41:39.442
- Glad you could come.
- Thanks for the exclusive.

41:39.510 --> 41:42.377
Well, it was authorized and everything.
Thank you for your help.

41:42.445 --> 41:45.047
- You want to sit down?
- Oh, I didn't come to stand.

41:45.115 --> 41:46.982
Good. That is great.

41:47.050 --> 41:49.885
So...

41:49.953 --> 41:53.756
- is this off the record?
- Celebrations are strictly "me time".

41:53.823 --> 41:56.090
OK. I've got to take
your word for that.

41:56.158 --> 41:58.192
You want a drink?

41:58.260 --> 42:00.962
- Sure.
- Good. I am gonna

42:01.030 --> 42:03.330
have to ask you what you want.
What would you like to drink?

42:03.398 --> 42:06.701
Something fruity.

42:06.769 --> 42:10.638
- Ha! Ha! Ha!
- OK. Fair enough.
