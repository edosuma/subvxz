05:29.327 --> 05:30.429
What'd we do last night?

05:32.130 --> 05:33.165
Lot of trick-or-treaters?

05:37.101 --> 05:38.170
Any candy left?

05:40.939 --> 05:41.941
Business was good.

05:42.274 --> 05:43.742
You give out one a piece
like I told you?

05:45.911 --> 05:46.879
What does that mean?

05:47.713 --> 05:49.047
Come on, Victor,
you got your hearing aid in.

05:49.514 --> 05:51.584
- What happened?
- They took it all, Jimmy.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.351
They... they took it all?
Who took it all?

05:53.851 --> 05:55.320
- Aladdin.
- Aladdin?

05:56.454 --> 05:57.389
One kid?

05:58.524 --> 06:00.059
You let one kid
take all the candy?

06:00.992 --> 06:02.360
I thought you were gonna
sit outside with it.

06:02.694 --> 06:04.530
Well, I pu... I put on
the dummy's clothes,

06:04.797 --> 06:07.633
because I wanted to make
believe I was the dummy.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.269
I wanted to scare 'em, but then,

06:10.668 --> 06:13.705
they all rolled up on me
at once and I got scared.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.908
Got scared to scare them.

06:16.509 --> 06:17.908
Mugged by a bunch
of little shits with

06:17.910 --> 06:19.912
- pillow cases.
- Aladdin.

06:20.478 --> 06:21.680
Eh, listen, shake it off.

06:22.713 --> 06:23.714
Fuck those kids.

06:24.048 --> 06:25.317
Next year,
I'm getting 'em apples.

06:29.654 --> 06:31.187
- Hey Jimmy.
- Morning.

06:31.189 --> 06:32.591
- Hey, Jimmy.
- How you doing?

06:33.024 --> 06:34.394
You didn't come home last night.

06:35.661 --> 06:38.030
I was doing inventory.
I was here all night.

06:39.831 --> 06:41.701
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:43.869 --> 06:45.437
Besides, you're okay
by yourself, right?

06:45.838 --> 06:47.103
You didn't have any problems.

06:47.105 --> 06:48.505
Outside the thing
with the goddamn candy,

06:48.507 --> 06:49.741
you did all right
by yourself, right?

06:51.509 --> 06:52.576
How's it going, Vic?

06:52.778 --> 06:53.812
What's the frequency
down here, buddy?

06:54.245 --> 06:55.745
Hey, did you guys hear
they're shooting a big old movie

06:55.747 --> 06:56.947
down there in the park?

06:56.949 --> 06:58.048
Yeah, we heard.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.117
Vic's all excited,

06:59.384 --> 07:00.716
he's gonna head
over there tonight, right Vic?

07:00.718 --> 07:02.053
Yeah,
it's a John Travolta movie,

07:02.521 --> 07:03.756
but he's not gonna be there.

07:04.189 --> 07:05.257
He's in Hollywood.

07:05.458 --> 07:06.522
Hey, you know, Vic,
You ought to take

07:06.524 --> 07:07.425
your fiddle down there.

07:08.093 --> 07:09.425
You never know, they might give
you a big part or something.

07:09.427 --> 07:10.394
He's right on that one, Victor.

07:10.762 --> 07:12.695
You ever notice
they're always hiring somebody

07:12.697 --> 07:14.096
to do something
in the background.

07:14.098 --> 07:16.533
It's not a fiddle, Donnie,
it's a violin.

07:16.535 --> 07:17.703
Whatever, same thing.

07:18.069 --> 07:19.271
It's not like we've ever
seen you play the damn thing.

07:19.437 --> 07:20.938
All right, leave him alone.

07:21.807 --> 07:24.039
He's had a rough night.
They took all his candy.

07:24.041 --> 07:25.110
They took his candy?

07:25.411 --> 07:27.112
- Who?
- Aladdin, that's who.

08:04.283 --> 08:05.318
Excuse me.

08:29.908 --> 08:32.475
Geez, Pat, are you okay?

08:34.913 --> 08:37.883
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

08:38.283 --> 08:39.518
Fucking druggy maniac.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.089
Look at me.

08:47.293 --> 08:48.360
Let's get you cleaned up.

08:48.827 --> 08:50.196
Just go, go outside, go have
a cigarette or something.

08:51.529 --> 08:52.430
All right.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.168
<i>Oak.</i>

08:56.701 --> 08:57.702
<i>Patti.</i>

08:59.070 --> 09:00.172
Are you all right?

09:03.341 --> 09:04.476
Somebody gonna look at you?

09:06.345 --> 09:07.245
Yeah.

09:12.717 --> 09:13.885
Call me if you need anything.

09:14.653 --> 09:16.721
Yeah. All right.
I'll talk to you later.

09:55.793 --> 09:56.962
- Hey, Leo.
- No.

09:58.830 --> 10:00.065
What was I gonna say?

10:00.331 --> 10:02.634
Am I getting any more
fucking new Hank Snow records?

10:02.934 --> 10:04.600
- Yeah.
- He's been dead,

10:04.602 --> 10:05.935
um, 20 years now,

10:05.937 --> 10:08.771
so he ain't gonna be
making any new albums.

10:08.773 --> 10:10.006
I know he's dead.

10:10.008 --> 10:12.208
So, stop asking me,
you chucklehead.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.379
You give me no joy, Leo.

10:15.447 --> 10:17.082
They're filming a movie here,
you know.

10:17.916 --> 10:19.484
- Who's they?
- They.

10:20.085 --> 10:21.119
Never heard of 'em.

10:21.385 --> 10:22.988
I might go over there tonight
and watch.

10:23.955 --> 10:24.956
You never know.

10:28.126 --> 10:30.161
- See ya' later, Leo.
- Okay, Vic.

11:59.149 --> 12:01.386
- Long day?
- Long day.

12:08.660 --> 12:09.694
You all right?

12:10.796 --> 12:12.865
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

12:15.267 --> 12:16.368
Where's Freddy?

12:18.136 --> 12:19.070
Getting ready for work.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.441
He was home all day?

12:23.375 --> 12:24.275
Yeah.

12:25.543 --> 12:26.745
Didn't wanna wake him.

12:27.879 --> 12:28.913
Why you ask?

12:29.914 --> 12:31.216
Don't know, just asking.

12:44.461 --> 12:46.899
Oh, look at fucking Victor, man.

12:47.566 --> 12:50.233
Ta-doo, ta-doo, ta-doo.

13:29.107 --> 13:31.741
Yo, he thinks it's a real
phone booth.

13:33.510 --> 13:34.643
Moron.

13:35.913 --> 13:37.081
We should do something.

13:39.317 --> 13:41.153
Yo, let's flip it!

13:58.136 --> 14:00.371
Jimmy, you need to get down
to Broad Street.

14:00.639 --> 14:02.374
- Why, what's up?
- It's, uh, your brother Vic.

14:07.511 --> 14:09.280
- Hey!
- Oh, oh, oh.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.948
- Hey, what happened?
- Wait, who are you?

14:11.950 --> 14:12.982
- I'm his brother.
- Jimmy?

14:12.984 --> 14:14.416
- Jimmy!
- What the fuck happened?

14:14.418 --> 14:16.252
We heard a crash
and this is what we found.

14:16.254 --> 14:17.554
Jimmy, get me outta here!

14:17.556 --> 14:18.988
Victor, we're gonna get you out.
You gotta relax.

14:18.990 --> 14:21.156
- I'm stuck, Jimmy, I'm stuck!
- Okay, relax, breathe.

14:21.158 --> 14:22.258
- Just breathe.
- Okay.

14:22.260 --> 14:23.526
- I'm here.
- Jimmy!

14:23.528 --> 14:24.594
Okay, I'm here now.

14:24.596 --> 14:25.494
Jimmy, get me...

14:26.664 --> 14:27.729
What's wrong?

14:27.731 --> 14:28.899
Victor, what's wrong?

14:29.301 --> 14:30.368
What's wrong?

14:30.634 --> 14:32.801
Oh, my hearing aid,
Jimmy, my hearing aid!

14:32.803 --> 14:34.170
Take the hearing aid out,
Victor.

14:34.172 --> 14:36.705
I can't reach it,
Jimmy, I'm stuck!

14:36.707 --> 14:38.273
- Okay, relax...
- Jimmy, Jimmy!

14:40.745 --> 14:41.779
Cover your face!

14:42.312 --> 14:43.512
Fuck!

14:46.650 --> 14:48.620
Is he all right?

14:49.019 --> 14:50.088
You okay?

14:51.823 --> 14:53.956
It's okay, it's okay,
you all right?

14:53.958 --> 14:55.926
You okay?

15:12.076 --> 15:13.477
Hey, knock it off.

15:14.178 --> 15:15.213
What do I always tell you?

15:15.581 --> 15:17.115
- Chuck it.
- What?

15:18.383 --> 15:20.653
Chuck it in the fuck-it bucket
and move on.

15:22.721 --> 15:23.987
But what else do I tell you?

15:23.989 --> 15:25.220
What did Grandma
used to tell us, huh?

15:25.222 --> 15:26.390
You can't what?

15:26.392 --> 15:28.661
You can't unring a bell,
right, hmm?

15:31.363 --> 15:32.661
Maybe if you didn't lose
or break

15:32.663 --> 15:34.497
every fucking cell phone
that I buy for you,

15:34.499 --> 15:35.931
then none of this
would've happened.

15:35.933 --> 15:38.635
I wasn't calling anybody Jimmy.
I was just playing.

15:39.370 --> 15:40.371
Come on, let's just drop it.

15:41.105 --> 15:42.539
Besides,
what'd the guy say, right?

15:42.541 --> 15:43.608
They come back to town...

15:44.375 --> 15:45.708
they'll let you,
put you in the movie.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.344
They'll let you stand on
a corner or something.

15:47.346 --> 15:48.547
They're not coming back.

15:48.947 --> 15:49.980
How do you know that?

15:50.280 --> 15:51.683
They went back to Hollywood.

15:57.556 --> 15:58.624
Do me a favor.

15:59.624 --> 16:00.926
Don't go disappearing today.

16:01.259 --> 16:02.994
You come straight back
from the bank, right?

16:03.528 --> 16:05.931
Need you to clean out
all the taps and move the kegs.

16:07.131 --> 16:08.666
Eat your eggs,
they're gonna be like ice.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.441
I know, Gram.

16:16.740 --> 16:17.974
Every day,
I'm getting a little sick

16:17.976 --> 16:19.510
of running this place
all by myself.

16:20.077 --> 16:22.280
You, me, Cheryl, it's not easy.

16:23.847 --> 16:24.946
By yourself?

16:24.948 --> 16:25.949
You goddamn right.

16:25.951 --> 16:27.782
You, Cheryl, and Grandma?

16:27.784 --> 16:28.820
You goddamn right.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.456
That don't make
no sense, Jimmy.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.091
Oh, yeah?
You feelin' better now?

16:33.892 --> 16:36.128
- Huh?
- You're goddamn right.

16:36.794 --> 16:37.795
Excuse me?

16:38.096 --> 16:39.130
You being a wise ass?

16:39.697 --> 16:42.431
- What?
- Don't what, stop it.

16:42.433 --> 16:44.336
Hello.

16:48.005 --> 16:49.140
You open?

16:49.908 --> 16:51.643
Yeah, we're open.

16:54.479 --> 16:55.480
Hello.

16:58.149 --> 16:59.149
Can I use your girl's room?

16:59.583 --> 17:00.485
Go ahead.

17:06.656 --> 17:08.159
Yeah, you're feeling
much better, huh?

17:13.832 --> 17:15.601
- Morning.
- Morning.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.202
How you doing, Jimmy?

17:20.538 --> 17:22.204
Hey there, Vic,
what's the frequency, buddy?

17:22.640 --> 17:24.076
- Just shut up, all right?
- What?

17:27.144 --> 17:28.745
Uh, Bell Atlantic,
we have a problem.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.046
Didn't I just ask you

17:30.048 --> 17:31.149
to shut the fuck up,

17:31.382 --> 17:32.381
- and leave him alone?
- Come on Jimmy,

17:32.383 --> 17:33.485
I'm just kidding.

17:33.684 --> 17:35.218
He's just bustin' with him,
Jimmy, come on.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.754
Well, sometimes he doesn't know
when to shut the fuck up.

17:36.988 --> 17:38.353
Aw, Vic, I'm sorry, man.

17:38.355 --> 17:39.656
You know I'm just messing
with you, right?

17:40.023 --> 17:41.525
You give me no joy, Donnie.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.528
That's it, Vic,
you tell him.

17:47.865 --> 17:48.732
Seriously, Jimmy?

17:49.334 --> 17:50.501
Nine in the morning with that?

17:50.902 --> 17:52.634
- What?
- It smells like weed,

17:52.636 --> 17:54.671
like somebody lit
a big bone up in here.

17:54.673 --> 17:56.240
- Excuse me?
- You smell that, Phil?

17:57.741 --> 17:58.710
I do.

18:09.887 --> 18:10.920
Hey.

18:10.922 --> 18:12.124
<i>Yo, I'll be right out.</i>

18:15.359 --> 18:16.294
You all right in there?

18:18.762 --> 18:19.730
Yep.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.269
You know this girl?

18:32.309 --> 18:36.048
Hey, do me a favor,
not in here with that, okay?

18:36.448 --> 18:38.350
I don't know what
you're talking about, but...

18:39.017 --> 18:40.219
thank you for your kindness.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.188
See ya', boys.

19:04.142 --> 19:05.443
Hi, Victor!

19:06.310 --> 19:08.178
- Oh hi, Judy.
- What happened last night?

19:08.445 --> 19:09.580
Heard you had an accident?

19:09.913 --> 19:10.847
I got pushed.

19:11.115 --> 19:12.150
You got pushed?

19:12.650 --> 19:13.652
It's a long story.

19:14.185 --> 19:15.750
Oh, don't be upset.

19:15.752 --> 19:17.020
I won't bother you about it.

19:17.821 --> 19:19.724
When are you gonna play
your violin for us?

19:20.991 --> 19:22.123
I wanna hear it!

19:22.125 --> 19:23.461
Yeah, someday.

20:56.721 --> 20:58.656
Hey, you wanna see
something funny?

20:59.156 --> 21:00.125
Read this.

21:15.073 --> 21:17.909
If something really big
and scary...

21:22.446 --> 21:24.348
and ugly and hairy...

21:25.116 --> 21:27.418
is following you around
this Halloween,

21:27.685 --> 21:28.720
don't be frightened.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.424
It's just your fat ass!

21:37.295 --> 21:38.596
Hey, are you following me?

21:40.432 --> 21:42.500
Not that you're big
and hairy and scary.

21:45.569 --> 21:47.338
It's okay. I don't care.

21:48.138 --> 21:49.373
You're not gonna hurt me, right?

21:50.407 --> 21:51.842
No. No, no.

21:52.410 --> 21:53.378
No.

21:54.346 --> 21:55.380
Are you okay?

21:55.946 --> 21:57.581
I saw what they did
to you last night.

21:57.882 --> 21:59.584
That was just downright
kinda fucked up.

22:01.086 --> 22:03.154
They were filming
a John Travolta movie...

22:04.221 --> 22:05.289
but he wasn't there.

22:05.789 --> 22:07.823
Jimmy said they might come back,

22:07.825 --> 22:09.461
but they went back to Hollywood.

22:11.261 --> 22:12.163
So, what's your name?

22:12.497 --> 22:13.698
Victor.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.296
Why are you
following me, Victor?

22:15.298 --> 22:16.835
Are you looking for a friend
to hang with?

22:18.569 --> 22:20.102
You don't look like
the kind of person

22:20.104 --> 22:21.405
people should be so mean to.

22:22.606 --> 22:25.309
I'll be your friend, if that
is what you're looking for?

22:32.517 --> 22:33.518
You're very pretty.

22:35.086 --> 22:36.054
I am?

22:36.453 --> 22:37.321
Oh.

22:38.056 --> 22:39.391
Well thank you, Victor.

22:45.796 --> 22:46.798
You're blushing.

22:50.267 --> 22:52.737
I'll... I'll have to remember
this one for next year.

22:53.371 --> 22:55.540
I got plenty of people
I can send that to.

22:56.673 --> 22:58.009
It's just your fat ass!

23:07.751 --> 23:09.052
<i>What you got there?</i>

23:09.054 --> 23:10.889
Oh, that's my violin.

23:11.856 --> 23:13.191
Are you going for a lesson?

23:14.692 --> 23:15.727
Um, no.

23:16.827 --> 23:18.028
Are you gonna
play it somewhere?

23:19.797 --> 23:20.999
No.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.601
You just like carrying
it around with you then.

23:25.869 --> 23:27.204
Yeah, I guess.

23:28.272 --> 23:30.074
Something special
you like to have with you.

23:30.708 --> 23:31.710
I get it.

23:34.412 --> 23:37.115
Say, what's your name again?

23:38.950 --> 23:40.552
I don't know,
what do you want it to be?

23:47.057 --> 23:48.058
I don't know.

23:55.366 --> 23:57.032
Maybe when I meet
someone new that I like,

23:57.034 --> 23:58.503
I like them to pick out
a name for me...

23:59.636 --> 24:00.638
and that way...

24:02.773 --> 24:05.476
if it's a name they already like
then they already like me.

24:11.082 --> 24:12.748
It's all right, you don't have
to pick out one now.

24:12.750 --> 24:13.751
You can do it later.

24:15.118 --> 24:16.153
Okay.

24:16.954 --> 24:18.220
Hey, say Victor,
you wouldn't happen to have

24:18.222 --> 24:19.289
a smoke on you, would you?

24:19.624 --> 24:20.592
Oh!

24:21.526 --> 24:23.662
No, I... I don't smoke,
Jimmy smokes.

24:24.260 --> 24:25.262
Who's Jimmy?

24:27.065 --> 24:28.298
Jimmy's my little brother.

24:28.898 --> 24:30.500
He's the one
that yelled at you at The Oak.

24:30.835 --> 24:32.937
That's our tavern, we own it.

24:33.704 --> 24:35.472
- Oh, you don't say?
- Yeah.

24:36.207 --> 24:38.443
It used to be
my dad's a long time ago...

24:39.611 --> 24:41.378
but me and Jimmy,
we work there together.

24:41.945 --> 24:43.981
Actually Victor,
I wouldn't say he yelled at me.

24:44.915 --> 24:47.051
He actually seems like
a nice man, your little bro.

24:49.953 --> 24:51.589
I've never seen you before.

24:52.656 --> 24:53.790
What street you from?

24:54.424 --> 24:55.626
I'm not from around here.

24:56.426 --> 24:57.862
I'm from all over the place.

24:59.096 --> 24:59.963
I usually just bus it,

25:00.565 --> 25:01.730
and then when I see somewhere
I might like to stay

25:01.732 --> 25:02.834
for a while,
that's where I get off.

25:04.102 --> 25:06.169
Why'd you come off
a bus here in Bloomfield?

25:06.171 --> 25:07.172
I don't know.

25:08.272 --> 25:09.773
I dig the way
this part looked...

25:10.106 --> 25:13.209
like it wasn't anything special
but it wasn't too bad either.

25:13.211 --> 25:15.012
Well, where do you sleep?

25:16.280 --> 25:18.881
Well, last night for instance,
I slept on that park bench

25:18.883 --> 25:20.018
under that pretty tree.

25:24.689 --> 25:28.058
But you don't have any mattress
or any pillow.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.362
No, I don't need none.

25:30.828 --> 25:33.764
I got a blanky in my knapsack,
a change of clothes, a book...

25:34.365 --> 25:35.698
and when I woke up this morning

25:35.700 --> 25:37.802
I was covered
in beautiful yellow leaves.

25:39.936 --> 25:40.871
What?

25:46.176 --> 25:47.211
Huh?

25:47.912 --> 25:49.077
You're weird.

25:50.381 --> 25:51.349
Yeah.

25:52.516 --> 25:53.685
That's right, Victor.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.220
And you wanna know what?

25:56.854 --> 25:58.890
You're pretty weird
yourself, aren't you?

26:00.924 --> 26:01.926
I guess.

26:05.163 --> 26:06.995
Don't let anybody tell you
that's a bad thing,

26:06.997 --> 26:08.033
'cause it's not.

26:08.731 --> 26:09.834
It's a good thing.

26:11.035 --> 26:12.366
It's not?

26:12.368 --> 26:14.105
Only the mediocre are
always at their best...

26:15.006 --> 26:17.542
and I can tell already,
that ain't us.

27:04.556 --> 27:05.690
<i>Vic!</i>

27:07.224 --> 27:08.259
<i>Victor!</i>

27:11.028 --> 27:13.064
Hey, where the hell
were you today?

27:13.631 --> 27:14.999
Didn't I ask you
not to disappear?

27:15.700 --> 27:16.933
I needed your help today?

27:17.233 --> 27:18.433
I was here.

27:18.435 --> 27:20.102
No, no you weren't here.

27:20.104 --> 27:21.770
I called the house six times!

27:21.772 --> 27:24.975
I got a fucking hernia moving
kegs around all day by myself.

27:25.476 --> 27:26.645
I guess I forgot.

27:26.877 --> 27:29.012
Don't give me you forgot,
because that's bullshit.

27:29.380 --> 27:31.613
Get it outta your head that
I'm just gonna keep taking care

27:31.615 --> 27:33.451
of you for the rest
of your life, because I'm not.

27:33.751 --> 27:35.449
Learn to pull your
own goddamn weight,

27:35.451 --> 27:37.585
and will you turn this shit off
for Christ's sakes?

27:37.587 --> 27:38.854
Hey!

27:38.856 --> 27:40.055
Can't you listen
to something else?

27:40.057 --> 27:41.256
That's all I ever hear.

27:41.258 --> 27:42.790
Hank Snow, Hank Snow!

27:42.792 --> 27:44.594
Who the hell listens
to Hank Snow anyway, you,

27:44.596 --> 27:46.895
- that's who!
- Hank Snow is a legend.

27:46.897 --> 27:48.165
That's Songs of Tragedy.

27:48.499 --> 27:51.201
Oh gee, Songs of Tragedy,
how uplifting.

27:51.501 --> 27:53.669
He's got a fucking
noose on his album cover!

27:53.671 --> 27:55.338
It's dreary, hillbilly shit.

27:55.839 --> 27:57.375
And since when do you
not make your bed?

27:58.008 --> 27:59.044
You're an adult.

27:59.777 --> 28:00.979
You have responsibility.

28:03.881 --> 28:06.184
Sorry, I didn't do it
on purpose.

28:08.885 --> 28:09.854
All right.

28:10.354 --> 28:12.520
Just finish up whatever this is,

28:12.522 --> 28:14.125
and then help me
downstairs with dinner.

28:14.458 --> 28:15.493
I'm going out tonight.

28:43.787 --> 28:44.822
Hey, Jimmy.

28:45.489 --> 28:47.692
You didn't really get
a hernia today, did you?

28:49.359 --> 28:50.360
No...

28:51.561 --> 28:52.529
but I could've.

28:52.997 --> 28:56.333
'Cause I was gonna say,
if you really did get a hernia,

28:56.901 --> 28:58.603
I'm sure Patti could
take care of you.

28:59.202 --> 29:00.237
Patti?

29:01.005 --> 29:02.040
What the hell does that mean?

29:02.673 --> 29:03.708
Who told you that?

29:04.808 --> 29:06.810
Listen,
you don't go saying shit,

29:07.411 --> 29:09.279
making up stories,
you understand?

29:09.580 --> 29:11.115
Her and I are good friends,
that's it.

29:11.515 --> 29:12.680
Yeah, but...

29:12.682 --> 29:13.785
No, no, no but.

29:15.486 --> 29:17.054
God forbid somebody hears you,

29:17.755 --> 29:19.023
and get the wrong impression.

29:19.923 --> 29:21.225
I can get in a lot of trouble.

29:22.894 --> 29:24.261
Patti, she's a married woman.

29:24.795 --> 29:26.128
You understand?

29:26.130 --> 29:27.132
Yeah, Jimmy.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.971
But alls I was saying
is that Patti's a nurse.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.373
She could help you.

29:37.441 --> 29:38.476
Oh.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.250
<i>Where you going big boy?</i>

29:49.686 --> 29:50.786
Hey!

29:50.788 --> 29:51.890
Where you going?

29:52.355 --> 29:53.423
Hey!

29:54.125 --> 29:55.891
Don't come near me!
I'll fuckin' jump!

29:55.893 --> 29:57.191
If I could only be so lucky.

29:57.193 --> 29:58.930
One less scumbag off
the fucking streets.

30:04.769 --> 30:05.901
Come here.

30:05.903 --> 30:07.035
You dumb motherfucker,

30:07.037 --> 30:08.103
you should've jumped.

30:08.105 --> 30:09.206
Do not fuck with me!

30:09.640 --> 30:10.738
I'll push you!

30:11.842 --> 30:13.109
Cuff him!

30:13.111 --> 30:14.612
I want a lawyer.

30:17.914 --> 30:19.116
- More tea?
- Hmm.

30:24.188 --> 30:25.723
There you go. Thanks.

30:30.827 --> 30:31.930
Hey, handsome.

30:33.064 --> 30:34.231
How ya doin'?

30:34.531 --> 30:36.297
You're late tonight,
baby, are you okay?

30:36.299 --> 30:37.401
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:37.768 --> 30:39.367
Guy steals a car in Belleville
and had to chase him

30:39.369 --> 30:40.635
all the way to Franklin.

30:40.637 --> 30:41.937
Can't fucking run
like I used to, Roberta,

30:41.939 --> 30:43.675
I'm telling ya'. Smoked.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.708
Franklin, they just paved that.

30:45.710 --> 30:46.975
Must be nice, right?

30:46.977 --> 30:47.979
Yeah, it's beautiful.

30:50.147 --> 30:51.680
- Where's your partner?
- Jerking off.

30:54.152 --> 30:55.651
Come on, it's freezing.

30:55.653 --> 30:57.353
Yeah, I know,
bad guys are still out there.

30:57.355 --> 30:58.489
- Um,
- Yeah?

30:58.689 --> 31:01.258
When I get off at one,
I could use a ride home.

31:02.292 --> 31:03.960
All right, I'll see
what I can do, all right?

32:40.624 --> 32:42.226
Un-fuckin-believable!

32:42.559 --> 32:43.626
Awesome.

32:43.961 --> 32:45.028
And what's with you?

32:45.997 --> 32:47.496
- Huh?
- What?

32:47.498 --> 32:48.865
I thought you said
you didn't know her.

32:51.268 --> 32:52.634
I've seen her around.

32:52.636 --> 32:53.804
Oh, you seen her around?

32:54.105 --> 32:55.336
Is that how all the uh,

32:55.338 --> 32:56.673
the "hello Victor"
business happened?

32:57.141 --> 32:59.240
Look at you,
got your nice shirt on,

32:59.242 --> 33:00.642
you smell like a barbershop.

33:00.644 --> 33:02.678
Starting to think,
maybe Vic's got a girlfriend

33:02.680 --> 33:03.844
he's been keeping from us.

33:03.846 --> 33:04.848
What?

33:06.950 --> 33:09.420
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Yeah?

33:10.554 --> 33:11.786
Didn't I just talk to you
yesterday,

33:11.788 --> 33:13.290
about doing that shit
in my bathroom?

33:13.824 --> 33:14.826
Doing what?

33:16.326 --> 33:17.461
What you were doing.

33:19.296 --> 33:20.264
Peeing?

33:20.797 --> 33:22.165
No, not peeing!

33:22.365 --> 33:24.665
You know what I'm talking about!
Smoking weed in my bathroom!

33:24.667 --> 33:25.734
I wasn't smoking weed.

33:25.736 --> 33:26.834
- Yes, you were...
- No, I wasn't.

33:26.836 --> 33:28.004
- Yes, you were...
- No, I wasn't!

33:28.006 --> 33:29.105
Do you think
I'm a fucking idiot?

33:29.506 --> 33:30.874
Honestly, you think I'm stupid?

33:31.307 --> 33:33.808
We all imagined the smell
of marijuana billowing out

33:33.810 --> 33:36.311
of the bathroom door,
not two feet away from the bar?

33:36.313 --> 33:37.582
Is that
what you're gonna tell me?

33:38.415 --> 33:39.384
Huh?

33:41.484 --> 33:42.552
I'm sorry.

33:43.819 --> 33:44.788
I'm really sorry.

33:45.021 --> 33:46.155
Just do me a favor.

33:46.957 --> 33:49.192
If you're gonna
smoke that stuff,

33:49.459 --> 33:50.992
smoke outside, not in here.

33:50.994 --> 33:52.026
- I got it.
- Yeah?

33:52.028 --> 33:52.997
- Yeah.
- You're clear?

33:53.297 --> 33:54.298
Clear.

33:56.334 --> 33:57.468
Can I go now?

33:57.768 --> 33:59.303
I'm not the principal, go.

34:03.307 --> 34:04.805
What am I running
an opium den?

34:04.807 --> 34:06.007
You gotta point, Jimmy.

34:06.009 --> 34:07.278
Cops come in here
and smell that,

34:07.545 --> 34:08.811
you're the one
that's gonna be in trouble.

34:09.045 --> 34:10.246
<i>Yeah, no shit.</i>

34:10.746 --> 34:12.347
<i>Her prancing in here, doing
whatever the hell she wants</i>

34:12.349 --> 34:13.384
<i>like she owns the place.</i>

34:14.018 --> 34:15.815
I wanna know
how this girl knows Vic.

34:15.818 --> 34:16.920
That's a good question, Victor.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.252
Hiya, Leo.

34:49.085 --> 34:50.052
Hello.

34:50.454 --> 34:51.389
Leo, this is my friend.

34:51.789 --> 34:54.492
This is Leo, it's his store.

34:59.762 --> 35:00.896
Hey, Leo?

35:00.898 --> 35:02.467
You get any new Hank Snow in?

35:03.233 --> 35:06.036
Um no, Vic, I... I don't.

35:06.335 --> 35:07.370
Okay.

35:07.905 --> 35:09.438
When do you think, maybe soon?

35:09.440 --> 35:11.375
You'll be the first
to know, Vic.

35:11.708 --> 35:13.877
You give me no joy, Leo.

35:14.577 --> 35:15.646
Who's Hank Snow?

35:17.081 --> 35:18.149
Hank Snow?

35:19.349 --> 35:20.585
He's The Singing Ranger.

35:21.985 --> 35:23.385
He's a legend.

35:23.387 --> 35:25.522
He was the longest-running
artist on any label.

35:25.789 --> 35:27.991
He was on RCA for 50 years!

35:28.291 --> 35:31.258
He recorded over a hundred
and forty albums.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.663
I only have a few
of them though.

35:34.231 --> 35:35.600
They're hard to get on vinyl.

35:39.737 --> 35:42.440
Ah, this one...
this one's one of my favorites.

35:43.139 --> 35:44.340
I might get it again.

35:44.875 --> 35:47.911
He's had a song on the charts
for five decades in a row.

35:48.945 --> 35:51.746
In 1949, he met Ernie Tubb

35:51.748 --> 35:54.782
and Ernie Tubb got him
into the Grand Ole Opry.

35:54.784 --> 35:55.819
Cool.

35:57.355 --> 35:59.420
- "Confused With the Blues."
- Oh,

35:59.422 --> 36:01.657
"I'm Moving On,"
was number one on the charts

36:01.659 --> 36:03.025
for 29 weeks.

36:03.027 --> 36:04.492
It's his signature song.

36:04.494 --> 36:07.729
Altogether, he had 85 singles
on the charts,

36:07.731 --> 36:09.634
and sold over 90 million albums.

36:10.601 --> 36:11.833
Fuck!

36:11.835 --> 36:14.005
You know everything
about Hank Snow.

36:15.106 --> 36:17.675
Hank Snow, The Singing Ranger.

36:18.409 --> 36:19.740
He's a legend.

36:19.742 --> 36:20.710
Well, why's he called
The Singing Ranger?

36:21.244 --> 36:22.880
Was he a park ranger
or something?

36:25.382 --> 36:26.416
Do you know?

36:26.817 --> 36:28.753
I... I never thought about it.

36:29.985 --> 36:31.154
Okay, we're done.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.524
See ya', Leo.

36:41.831 --> 36:43.034
You own the whole house?

36:44.134 --> 36:45.135
Yeah.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.571
Me and Jimmy.

36:47.503 --> 36:48.639
It's a two-family.

36:48.938 --> 36:51.975
Our grandma used to live
downstairs here before she died.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.113
Well, who lives here now?

36:56.646 --> 36:57.581
Nobody.

36:57.914 --> 36:59.380
It's just the way
Grandma left it

36:59.382 --> 37:01.451
before her heart stopped
last Thanksgiving.

37:03.219 --> 37:04.254
Her heart stopped?

37:05.222 --> 37:06.257
It quit on her.

37:09.025 --> 37:10.525
Grandma took care
of me and Jimmy

37:10.527 --> 37:11.729
after our parents died.

37:12.628 --> 37:13.730
She was the best.

37:19.536 --> 37:20.771
- Hey.
- Yeah?

37:22.206 --> 37:23.240
Do you wanna see it?

37:39.722 --> 37:41.891
Um, this is the dining room.

37:58.608 --> 37:59.943
This is the living room.

38:05.416 --> 38:06.584
This is the kitchen.

38:19.028 --> 38:20.164
This is her bedroom.

38:32.275 --> 38:33.443
That's Grandma.

38:34.244 --> 38:36.113
It's the same picture
we have in The Oak.

38:39.148 --> 38:40.817
She bought me my violin.

38:44.153 --> 38:45.623
I used to play it for her...

38:48.925 --> 38:50.027
but no one else.

38:53.931 --> 38:55.266
Victor, what happened to you?

38:57.934 --> 38:59.136
You're different, I know.

39:00.670 --> 39:01.905
You're not like other people.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.008
What happened?

39:06.009 --> 39:07.978
I had an accident
when I was a kid.

39:09.478 --> 39:10.914
It was an act of God.

39:14.451 --> 39:15.485
Yep.

39:17.588 --> 39:18.656
An act of God.

40:27.523 --> 40:29.926
- I hope you're hungry.
- I am.

40:32.929 --> 40:34.097
Thank you, Victor.

40:40.637 --> 40:41.638
You didn't want it?

40:42.204 --> 40:45.374
Oh, that was the sweetest thing
that you did that,

40:45.376 --> 40:47.210
but I can't take your pillow.

40:47.677 --> 40:48.945
You understand, right?

40:49.445 --> 40:50.811
Why not?

40:50.813 --> 40:52.782
- Are you leaving?
- No, not right now, but...

40:53.916 --> 40:55.217
pretty soon, I'm sure.

40:56.353 --> 40:58.556
You know, no one's ever
given me their pillow before.

41:10.934 --> 41:12.102
What are you doing?

41:15.304 --> 41:16.373
What you got there?

41:16.739 --> 41:18.572
- It's for you.
- Hmm?

41:18.574 --> 41:19.675
It's a diamond pin.

41:19.943 --> 41:21.775
Oh, no, no, Victor.

41:21.777 --> 41:22.978
You don't
have to give me presents.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.414
It belonged to my grandmother.

41:24.780 --> 41:26.248
- Victor.
- Open it.

41:26.650 --> 41:27.882
- Victor, you...
- Take it.

41:27.884 --> 41:29.853
It's a diamond pin
and it's for you.

41:30.387 --> 41:31.719
Victor, you don't even know me.

41:31.721 --> 41:33.690
Please, take it,
it's a diamond pin.

41:34.190 --> 41:35.158
Take it!

41:36.360 --> 41:37.394
Victor.

41:43.867 --> 41:45.202
It's a dime-and-pin,

41:45.702 --> 41:47.037
get it?

41:50.606 --> 41:53.407
Victor, I fucking love it!

41:54.777 --> 41:57.380
Did you think
that I fell in love with you?

42:01.184 --> 42:02.784
It's a Henny Youngman joke.

42:02.786 --> 42:04.153
You can give it
to somebody else.

42:04.588 --> 42:05.890
You big goof!

43:15.257 --> 43:16.460
Use a fork, will ya'?

43:16.860 --> 43:18.329
I like chopsticks, Jimmy.

43:19.396 --> 43:20.762
It's a Chinese restaurant.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.733
All right, well,
we're not in Tokyo now, are we?

43:23.934 --> 43:25.636
It's a lousy invention,
use the fork.

43:26.369 --> 43:27.371
Hong Kong.

43:28.605 --> 43:29.606
What?

43:34.010 --> 43:35.646
You getting friendly
with this girl, Victor?

43:36.012 --> 43:38.047
- Who?
- Who, you tell me who.

43:42.918 --> 43:44.288
She's my friend, Jimmy.

43:45.221 --> 43:46.188
All right, well...

43:46.922 --> 43:48.458
I don't want you getting
too friendly with her.

43:49.726 --> 43:51.695
She's a pothead,
you know what that means.

43:51.996 --> 43:53.930
- She's bad news.
- She's my friend, Jimmy.

43:54.630 --> 43:58.099
And she says, she says you
seem like a good person.

43:58.101 --> 43:59.469
Oh, is that what she says, huh?

43:59.768 --> 44:01.304
'Cause she knows me so well.

44:02.472 --> 44:03.674
What do you know
about this girl?

44:04.307 --> 44:05.775
<i>Where's she from?
What's her name?</i>

44:06.409 --> 44:07.677
<i>She don't use a name.</i>

44:08.244 --> 44:09.776
What do you mean,
she don't use a name?

44:09.778 --> 44:10.813
She don't use a name.

44:11.782 --> 44:13.280
<i>See, that's what
I'm talking about.</i>

44:13.282 --> 44:15.318
<i>What kind of a girl
doesn't use a name, huh?</i>

44:15.652 --> 44:17.354
What's she trying to hide,
she don't use a name?

44:17.653 --> 44:20.324
She's the gal
who invented kissing.

44:23.827 --> 44:26.494
Like the Hank Snow song,
The Gal Who Invented Kissing...

44:26.496 --> 44:28.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hold on.

44:29.065 --> 44:30.200
You guys kissed?

44:33.135 --> 44:34.269
Okay, Victor,

44:34.570 --> 44:36.306
I don't want you hanging out
with this girl any more.

44:36.572 --> 44:38.238
I don't need this, okay?

44:38.240 --> 44:40.143
I don't need to be watching out
for you all the time.

44:40.510 --> 44:42.209
You don't have to watch
out for me, Jimmy...

44:42.211 --> 44:43.213
Oh no?

44:43.679 --> 44:44.914
What happened
with the phone booth?

44:45.648 --> 44:46.914
I was pushed.

44:46.916 --> 44:49.182
Pushed by who?
Huh, nobody saw you get pushed.

44:49.184 --> 44:50.684
The girl, she saw it.

44:50.686 --> 44:52.188
Oh, the girl saw you get pushed?

44:55.891 --> 44:56.792
Great.

44:57.494 --> 44:59.496
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, shut up.

45:00.829 --> 45:02.195
Oh, look who it is!

45:02.197 --> 45:03.298
- Hey.
- Hey Vic.

45:04.132 --> 45:05.833
Jimmy, what do you say?
How's everything, how's The Oak?

45:05.835 --> 45:07.670
- Well, you know, still The Oak.
- Yeah, yeah.

45:08.038 --> 45:09.470
How's everything, how's Patti?

45:09.472 --> 45:10.639
She's good. You know,

45:10.641 --> 45:11.708
still the same pain in my ass.

45:12.074 --> 45:13.173
We keep missing each other
you know,

45:13.175 --> 45:14.610
I come home, she goes to work.

45:15.043 --> 45:16.543
Plus, I'm out there trying
to get my real estate

45:16.545 --> 45:17.580
license right now.

45:17.880 --> 45:18.878
I'm trying to make some
extra money, you know?

45:18.880 --> 45:19.716
I hear you.

45:21.016 --> 45:23.217
Listen, Freddy,
I'm... I'm having this problem.

45:23.219 --> 45:25.754
I got this, uh, this drifter.

45:26.054 --> 45:27.289
She keeps coming in the bar,

45:27.456 --> 45:28.956
she's getting high
in my bathroom all the time,

45:28.958 --> 45:29.925
I mean, what do I do?

45:30.393 --> 45:31.661
Is she selling?

45:31.894 --> 45:33.563
No, no, no, nothing like that,
but I mean, you know.

45:33.829 --> 45:35.162
It's like reefer madness.

45:35.164 --> 45:36.697
I mean, she's getting
high smoking a bone,

45:36.699 --> 45:38.367
the whole place
stinks like weed.

45:38.702 --> 45:40.302
Listen, don't worry about it.

45:40.304 --> 45:41.470
Fuck it, you'll be all right.

45:41.472 --> 45:43.003
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she comes in again,

45:43.005 --> 45:44.940
you give me a call.
I'll tune her up for you.

45:45.275 --> 45:46.410
I'll see you later, Vic.

45:51.847 --> 45:52.981
What?

46:00.556 --> 46:01.424
Hey!

46:02.092 --> 46:03.590
No, no, no, no, no.

46:03.592 --> 46:04.627
Not again today.

46:04.894 --> 46:06.260
- You know...
- Nope, no. You gotta go, scram.

46:06.262 --> 46:07.662
I have to use the bathroom,
is that okay?

46:07.664 --> 46:08.996
I don't care,
what are you gonna do,

46:08.998 --> 46:10.197
- smoke a bone in there...
- No, no.

46:10.199 --> 46:11.365
No, you have to leave.

46:11.367 --> 46:12.534
Well, we talked
about this already.

46:12.536 --> 46:13.570
- Now!
- I promised, Jimmy.

46:13.969 --> 46:14.668
- I'm trying to run a business!
- Please!

46:14.670 --> 46:15.404
I gotta pee!

46:15.806 --> 46:16.773
I gotta pee, Jimmy.

46:17.273 --> 46:18.373
Come on.

46:18.375 --> 46:19.874
Make it fast.
What is this?

46:19.876 --> 46:21.275
She's gotta pee, she gotta pee.

47:48.498 --> 47:50.197
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God,

47:50.199 --> 47:52.467
oh my God, oh my God, oh my
God, oh my God, oh my God!

47:57.039 --> 47:58.141
There's two guys over there.

47:58.307 --> 47:59.907
They're...
they're sucking each other off,

47:59.909 --> 48:01.376
and they were trying
to get me to watch!

48:01.378 --> 48:03.010
All right, hold on,
hold on, relax, come on.

48:03.012 --> 48:04.014
Thank you, sir.

48:14.356 --> 48:15.555
Hey!

48:15.557 --> 48:16.893
What the fuck
you two doing, huh?

50:48.978 --> 50:50.110
You look pretty.

50:50.112 --> 50:51.313
What are you doing,
you going out?

50:54.818 --> 50:55.752
Wow!

50:56.052 --> 50:57.351
That's it, huh?

50:57.353 --> 50:58.552
One lousy piece of chicken?

50:58.554 --> 50:59.820
So now you're unhappy,
I suppose...

50:59.822 --> 51:01.458
All I'm asking
is if there's any more chicken.

51:03.326 --> 51:04.360
Hmm?

51:08.498 --> 51:10.400
There, now you got two.

51:10.699 --> 51:11.666
You want three?

51:11.967 --> 51:13.036
Don't know why
you're busting my balls, Patti.

51:15.672 --> 51:16.706
Where were you last night?

51:17.373 --> 51:18.340
Where am I every night?

51:18.574 --> 51:19.840
You stop at that diner?

51:19.842 --> 51:21.309
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

51:21.311 --> 51:22.677
- Yeah.
- You had a nice little visit

51:22.679 --> 51:24.012
with your waitress friend?

51:24.179 --> 51:26.045
Well, they did serve me coffee
and a fucking brownie,

51:26.047 --> 51:28.883
so, unless brownies are giving
reach-arounds these days...

51:29.751 --> 51:31.119
Come on, what's with all
the questions, huh?

51:31.786 --> 51:33.119
So now I'm picking a fight?

51:33.121 --> 51:34.554
Oh, I get it.

51:34.556 --> 51:35.658
You're on your fucking period.

51:40.396 --> 51:42.298
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

51:43.833 --> 51:45.532
- I'm going out.
- Nice, where you going?

51:45.534 --> 51:46.603
I don't know, out.

51:47.036 --> 51:49.139
Okay, I'll be here
with my one piece of chicken.

51:49.438 --> 51:51.040
Fuckin-A,
I feel like Henry VIII!

51:57.746 --> 51:59.482
Karen LaMonica just went by.

52:01.583 --> 52:04.320
Her son, Mike, he was on
a submarine for two years.

52:05.922 --> 52:07.222
Heard he went AWOL last week.

52:07.556 --> 52:08.424
Oh yeah?

52:12.228 --> 52:13.596
Tell me what you meant
that time.

52:14.597 --> 52:15.598
What?

52:15.965 --> 52:17.266
You remember that time
I had that thing at work?

52:17.766 --> 52:19.400
That guy knocked me down?

52:19.402 --> 52:22.139
You asked me about Freddy,
why I didn't wanna wake him?

52:23.072 --> 52:24.304
What'd you mean?

52:24.306 --> 52:25.641
I don't know,
that was a while ago.

52:26.108 --> 52:27.175
That was three weeks ago.

52:27.476 --> 52:28.411
What'd you mean?

52:28.811 --> 52:29.679
Nothing.

52:29.945 --> 52:30.980
Then why were you asking?

52:31.815 --> 52:32.782
I wanna know.

52:34.416 --> 52:35.384
I don't know.

52:36.251 --> 52:37.820
Come on.

52:40.523 --> 52:42.023
I wonder
why you won't just tell me.

52:42.025 --> 52:42.959
Jesus Christ.

52:44.460 --> 52:45.862
You know how much those
fucking things weigh?

52:46.396 --> 52:47.427
I can barely roll one.

52:48.931 --> 52:50.199
He just moves them around
like he's Magilla Gorilla.

53:11.554 --> 53:13.088
Do you think Victor's
ever had sex?

53:15.257 --> 53:16.293
What?

53:17.425 --> 53:18.959
He's your brother,
why you asking me?

53:18.961 --> 53:20.762
I just thought that women
had like a sixth sense

53:20.764 --> 53:22.195
or something
for that, I don't know.

53:22.197 --> 53:24.701
Wait, you worried
about that girl, the pothead?

53:26.769 --> 53:28.103
Why don't you just ask Victor?

53:29.139 --> 53:30.573
Don't you guys talk
about that stuff?

53:30.873 --> 53:33.443
I thought all guys talked
about who they slept with.

53:37.579 --> 53:38.547
Come on.

53:39.047 --> 53:40.081
Tell me what you meant.

53:40.648 --> 53:41.917
I don't know, I...

53:43.686 --> 53:45.788
I don't know, Patti,
some maniac jumps you at work.

53:46.054 --> 53:47.354
You get blood all over you.

53:47.356 --> 53:48.925
You call me
to make you feel better.

53:51.193 --> 53:52.327
Three times, you call me.

53:53.228 --> 53:55.164
Not your husband.
What does that tell you?

53:57.166 --> 53:59.365
He was sleeping,
didn't wanna wake him up.

53:59.367 --> 54:00.568
You'd have woken me up though,
right?

54:00.570 --> 54:01.705
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:03.606 --> 54:05.242
- That's different.
- Why's it different?

54:09.744 --> 54:11.047
You're beautiful, you know that?

54:11.880 --> 54:12.945
Keep dreaming.

54:12.947 --> 54:14.447
Okay, you're right, you're not.

54:14.449 --> 54:15.484
I'm making it all up.

54:15.751 --> 54:16.883
I'm just trying to build
up your self-esteem.

54:16.885 --> 54:17.920
You're actually ugly.

54:18.586 --> 54:19.820
And you're nuts.

54:19.822 --> 54:21.024
Is Freddy nuts too?

54:23.726 --> 54:24.628
Yeah.

54:26.829 --> 54:27.731
I mean...

54:31.166 --> 54:32.369
What are we talking about Jimmy?

54:34.369 --> 54:35.237
Us.

54:35.905 --> 54:37.474
It's not like
that's gonna happen, is it?

54:37.773 --> 54:39.273
It's not like you're
gonna leave Freddy.

54:39.275 --> 54:41.811
Who says so?
I look for excuses all the time.

54:42.445 --> 54:44.514
- Nice, you need an excuse.
- No!

54:45.880 --> 54:47.581
It's not like you
don't have Victor.

54:47.583 --> 54:48.785
I don't have Victor.

54:49.686 --> 54:51.184
What is that supposed to mean?
Victor's fine

54:51.186 --> 54:52.552
- on his own...
- You know what I mean.

54:52.554 --> 54:53.556
He's like a big kid.

54:54.389 --> 54:57.958
He's sweet, he's like
a big, sweet lummox.

54:57.960 --> 54:59.427
All right,
Victor is not a lummox.

54:59.429 --> 55:00.561
I said sweet...

55:00.563 --> 55:01.695
- Oh, that makes it better.
- Lummox.

55:01.697 --> 55:03.063
Well I didn't mean
it in a bad way!

55:03.065 --> 55:04.365
Well, how do you mean it then...

55:04.367 --> 55:05.635
- Well, you know...
- Is there a good way?

55:05.800 --> 55:08.235
I wouldn't never talk...
that way about your brother!

55:08.237 --> 55:09.105
You just did.

55:09.771 --> 55:11.007
Look, he is what he is.

55:11.407 --> 55:13.907
There's just plenty a better
choice of words than lummox.

55:13.909 --> 55:14.809
Like what?

55:15.077 --> 55:16.145
Magilla Gorilla?

55:17.146 --> 55:19.545
Come on, you took
it the wrong way.

55:19.547 --> 55:20.649
I'm sorry, okay?

55:21.184 --> 55:23.420
It's just we both have things
that come along with the deal.

55:26.054 --> 55:26.989
Fuck!

55:28.389 --> 55:29.592
What's the matter?

55:29.759 --> 55:31.157
I'm missing $2200,
that's what's the matter!

55:31.159 --> 55:33.328
- How?
- It's all fucked up.

55:33.596 --> 55:36.095
Victor loses half
the goddamn bank receipts

55:36.097 --> 55:37.932
and I got nothing to go
on but these shitty books.

55:37.934 --> 55:39.599
I don't know why you
don't have a bookkeeper

55:39.601 --> 55:41.936
- to do all this.
- Just relax, okay?

55:41.938 --> 55:43.269
You don't understand relax

55:43.271 --> 55:44.704
and I can't afford
a fucking bookkeeper,

55:44.706 --> 55:47.108
'cause I'm missing $2200,
maybe that's a problem.

55:47.110 --> 55:48.275
- Okay.
- I got insurance bills,

55:48.277 --> 55:49.976
car payments, I'm paying off

55:49.978 --> 55:52.181
that stupid,
high-def TV that he wanted.

55:52.614 --> 55:54.615
I'm paying liquor distributors
for this fucking shithole...

55:54.617 --> 55:56.486
Hey stop cursing,
you sound like Freddy!

56:04.594 --> 56:05.760
Hey, Vic.

56:05.762 --> 56:07.096
Remember Mike LaMonica?

56:07.463 --> 56:09.530
He went AWOL
on a fucking submarine.

56:09.532 --> 56:11.033
How do you do that?
What, did he swim?

56:11.500 --> 56:12.833
Fucking Aquaman?

56:12.835 --> 56:14.668
- Hey.
- This is what Patti tells me.

56:14.670 --> 56:17.105
If I wanna get yelled at,
I'll go home and get yelled at.

56:17.706 --> 56:19.275
Call me when you're in
a better mood.

56:32.121 --> 56:33.653
Oak.

56:33.655 --> 56:35.655
Jimmy, where are you?

56:35.657 --> 56:37.693
What do you mean, where am I?
You just called me, didn't you?

56:38.161 --> 56:39.526
Are you coming home now?

56:39.528 --> 56:40.760
No, how am I gonna come home?

56:40.762 --> 56:41.994
I'm still trying to figure out

56:41.996 --> 56:43.496
where the goddamn
money went, okay?

56:43.498 --> 56:45.199
<i>I'm up to my eyeballs
in fucking paperwork.</i>

56:45.201 --> 56:46.599
Just stop calling me
every five minutes,

56:46.601 --> 56:47.733
so I can get this shit done!

56:47.735 --> 56:48.904
Okay, Jimmy.

56:49.771 --> 56:51.238
But you are coming home, right?

56:51.240 --> 56:53.005
Eh, yes no,
maybe, I don't know.

56:53.007 --> 56:55.242
I'll be home
when I'm done with this, okay?

56:55.244 --> 56:56.342
Just stop calling.

57:38.387 --> 57:39.556
Oh!

57:39.922 --> 57:42.524
Um, can you close the door,
it's cold.

58:04.480 --> 58:05.849
Would you like some coffee?

58:06.748 --> 58:07.750
Sure.

58:08.117 --> 58:09.618
How long have you been
staying here?

58:10.052 --> 58:11.854
Two weeks, on and off.

58:12.253 --> 58:13.989
Now I know where all
the food's been going.

58:16.190 --> 58:17.458
Victor let you in?

58:17.460 --> 58:18.528
Of course.

58:19.927 --> 58:21.463
I come in through the basement.

58:22.831 --> 58:23.999
He said he'd talk to you first.

58:24.500 --> 58:25.668
You don't say?

58:26.501 --> 58:28.269
I don't suppose
he got the chance?

58:28.271 --> 58:29.436
No.

58:29.438 --> 58:30.604
You mad?

58:30.606 --> 58:32.472
Listen, whatever your name is,

58:32.474 --> 58:34.043
I'm really
not in the mood for this.

58:34.809 --> 58:36.175
I'm having a bad day.

58:36.177 --> 58:37.279
It's late.

58:37.512 --> 58:39.715
I'm tired, so just...

58:40.349 --> 58:41.517
What do you want?

58:41.949 --> 58:44.086
I don't suppose you mean
what do I want in my coffee?

58:45.288 --> 58:47.387
Okay, what do you
want in your coffee?

58:47.389 --> 58:49.356
I'm not really a coffee person.

58:49.358 --> 58:50.593
Can I have tea?

58:52.628 --> 58:54.161
- I know what you're thinking.
- Do you?

58:54.163 --> 58:56.028
You think I'm taking
advantage of your brother.

58:56.030 --> 58:57.498
- And?
- Well, you're wrong.

58:57.500 --> 58:59.032
I know he's different and

58:59.034 --> 59:01.135
I know people around here
treat him like shit

59:01.137 --> 59:02.371
and he doesn't deserve it.

59:02.972 --> 59:05.371
And I respect you
for taking care of him,

59:05.373 --> 59:07.576
and looking out for him.
If you weren't suspicious,

59:08.143 --> 59:09.709
then you wouldn't be
much of a brother.

59:09.711 --> 59:11.512
- Can we cut the shit?
- It's not shit!

59:11.514 --> 59:13.046
What do you want?
What are you looking for?

59:13.048 --> 59:14.717
I just wanted
to be his friend.

59:15.516 --> 59:16.585
His friend?

59:17.387 --> 59:18.552
Is that what you
think Victor thinks,

59:18.554 --> 59:20.154
- that you're his friend?
- Yeah, I do.

59:20.856 --> 59:22.291
No, no, no, no. See, you,

59:22.557 --> 59:24.460
you're the girl
who invented kissing.

59:25.260 --> 59:26.596
He told you that.

59:27.329 --> 59:28.561
That's my fault.

59:28.563 --> 59:30.065
I told him to pick out
a name for me.

59:30.965 --> 59:32.065
Well?

59:32.067 --> 59:33.335
What is your name?

59:33.702 --> 59:35.103
Look, do you want me to leave?

59:35.804 --> 59:36.873
'Cause I will.

59:37.373 --> 59:39.742
I'm used to taking care
of myself, it's what I do.

59:40.476 --> 59:42.008
You mean like with my money?

59:42.010 --> 59:43.209
What money?

59:43.211 --> 59:44.211
Victor didn't mention
anything to you

59:44.213 --> 59:45.512
about the bar missing any money?

59:45.514 --> 59:46.646
No, asshole!

59:46.648 --> 59:48.150
I don't appreciate
the accusation!

59:48.583 --> 59:49.883
- Hey!
- If you got nothing to hide,

59:49.885 --> 59:51.084
- you got nothing to worry about.
- Hey,

59:51.086 --> 59:52.588
what the fuck
are you doing?

59:53.755 --> 59:55.824
- What do you got in here, huh?
- No one touches my fucking shit!

59:56.291 --> 59:57.326
Asshole!

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.762
Don't think I'm afraid of you
'cause I'm not, motherfucker!

01:00:06.902 --> 01:00:08.471
Get the fuck off of me.

01:01:02.958 --> 01:01:04.494
I'm sorry I didn't come home
last night.

01:01:06.494 --> 01:01:08.597
I know I told you I said
I would and I didn't.

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:12.669
So, let's just leave it
at that, okay?

01:01:17.773 --> 01:01:19.142
Why is there three?

01:01:21.143 --> 01:01:22.911
- It's a tea.
- A tea?

01:01:27.882 --> 01:01:28.984
Morning.

01:01:30.818 --> 01:01:32.021
Morning.

01:01:32.887 --> 01:01:35.223
Oh, thank you.

01:01:36.992 --> 01:01:39.193
Uh, would you
like some breakfast?

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.360
No, thank you.

01:01:40.362 --> 01:01:42.130
Breakfast makes me pokey.

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:44.867
Hey, Jimmy?

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:46.402
Did you find that money?

01:01:46.668 --> 01:01:47.703
No.

01:01:49.304 --> 01:01:50.638
What happened?

01:01:51.206 --> 01:01:53.005
Jimmy lost $2200.

01:01:53.007 --> 01:01:55.710
Okay, I didn't lose $2200.

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.644
The books are short,
that's all, so whatever I did,

01:01:58.646 --> 01:01:59.782
whether I added wrong...

01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:02.018
let's just drop it

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:04.019
Okay, you can't unring a bell.

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:07.056
Maybe you should
hire a bookkeeper.

01:02:09.958 --> 01:02:11.624
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.

01:02:11.626 --> 01:02:14.394
- Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
- Look at the size of that thing.

01:02:14.396 --> 01:02:16.164
I've got 27 pounds.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.868
What do you think, Vic?

01:02:20.335 --> 01:02:21.534
I've never seen
something like that before.

01:02:21.536 --> 01:02:23.105
You never seen
a turkey before?

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:25.474
Hey, Jimmy.

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.945
- What's up?
- She's invited, right?

01:02:31.713 --> 01:02:33.514
Yeah, of course.
It's Thanksgiving, right?

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:34.650
Yeah.

01:02:34.949 --> 01:02:36.751
Turkey bowl!

01:02:44.893 --> 01:02:48.763
So, it's you and you,
me, Donnie, Phil,

01:02:49.597 --> 01:02:51.731
Freddy, Patti,
Irene, Irene's mom.

01:02:51.733 --> 01:02:52.932
Mm-hmm.

01:02:58.773 --> 01:03:00.807
What is it?
Hour every three pounds or so?

01:03:00.809 --> 01:03:02.011
Something like that.

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:03.610
Frigging thing's so big,
I've moved all the racks,

01:03:03.612 --> 01:03:04.912
it still barely fits in.

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:06.579
Guy's like a 35-pound
monster in there.

01:03:06.581 --> 01:03:07.817
Yeah, right?

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:10.586
Gonna go for a smoke.
Coming?

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:11.820
- No.
- No.

01:03:13.288 --> 01:03:14.920
I'm gonna stay here
and chill with James, all right?

01:03:14.922 --> 01:03:16.224
Keep him company.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.195
Everything under control
over there, buddy?

01:03:22.197 --> 01:03:23.329
Need any help?

01:03:23.331 --> 01:03:24.764
Nah, we're good, Fred, thanks.

01:03:24.766 --> 01:03:25.768
All right.

01:03:26.168 --> 01:03:28.068
How's The Oak? Still got
that chick coming in there

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.637
who was blazing up
the weed in the bathroom?

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.938
No, no, we took care of that.

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.541
- Oh, you did?
- Thank you, yeah.

01:03:41.215 --> 01:03:42.652
Hey, Jimmy, let me
ask you something.

01:03:43.851 --> 01:03:45.821
You ever see Patti
in there with anybody?

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:50.123
You mean like,
with a guy or something?

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:51.724
Yeah, like, with a guy,
you know,

01:03:51.726 --> 01:03:53.659
like someone
that's not me, behind my back.

01:03:53.661 --> 01:03:55.997
No, no, nothing like that.

01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:57.865
- Patti's a good lady.
- Yeah.

01:03:58.266 --> 01:03:59.599
She comes in with Barbara,
that's all.

01:03:59.601 --> 01:04:01.101
Barbara!

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.137
Jesus.

01:04:02.436 --> 01:04:03.670
You know, you got that
one that's married,

01:04:03.672 --> 01:04:04.773
then you got one who's single,

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.673
the single one starts chirping
in the married one's ear

01:04:06.675 --> 01:04:09.512
- and hello, here we go.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

01:04:10.144 --> 01:04:11.246
But you know me.

01:04:11.646 --> 01:04:13.114
I'm fucking psycho, man,
I will put someone in the dirt!

01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:14.382
Yeah.

01:04:15.817 --> 01:04:17.219
Aw, fuck!

01:04:18.152 --> 01:04:19.454
I'm fucking paranoid!

01:04:20.021 --> 01:04:21.088
Jesus Christ,

01:04:21.356 --> 01:04:22.856
I wish that Barb would
just find a man already!

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:24.026
Yeah, right?

01:04:25.226 --> 01:04:27.596
All right, anyway.

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:32.965
Hey, who's that hot piece
of ass in there you knew?

01:04:32.967 --> 01:04:34.233
You hitting that shit?

01:04:34.235 --> 01:04:36.536
No, no, that's Victor's friend.

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:39.608
- Fuck outta here with that!
- Why, it's not funny.

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:41.441
Just relax,
I'm not saying nothing.

01:04:41.443 --> 01:04:43.912
It's just that, I don't know,
she looks familiar.

01:04:44.612 --> 01:04:46.047
I swear I've seen her before.

01:04:48.717 --> 01:04:50.816
All right, coming in hot!

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:52.985
- Wow!
- Nice.

01:04:52.987 --> 01:04:54.723
Nice, good job, boys.

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.595
All right, Victor, the grace.

01:04:59.994 --> 01:05:01.763
- Okay.
- Can I?

01:05:02.597 --> 01:05:04.065
That's if Victor doesn't mind.

01:05:04.833 --> 01:05:06.333
But Victor always does
the grace.

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:07.470
I don't mind, Jimmy.

01:05:07.936 --> 01:05:08.871
Thanks.

01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:10.936
All right.

01:05:10.938 --> 01:05:13.407
I, uh, I don't really make it
to church ever,

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.307
but I just wanna
thank Jimmy and Victor

01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:16.844
for inviting me into their home.

01:05:17.411 --> 01:05:20.281
I pray the universe will help
those in their time of need,

01:05:20.548 --> 01:05:24.583
pain, sorrow and sadness,
and give them hope,

01:05:24.585 --> 01:05:27.088
strength,
and happiness to carry on.

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.392
And if on this day,
you can remember the poor,

01:05:30.759 --> 01:05:35.298
the sick, the homeless,
and most especially, the lonely.

01:05:36.864 --> 01:05:37.965
I'm hungry.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.336
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.237
What do you want, this?

01:05:44.239 --> 01:05:45.940
Oh!

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.606
- I'm sorry.
- Vic!

01:05:47.608 --> 01:05:49.510
Aw, Irene, don't worry about it.

01:05:50.545 --> 01:05:52.079
Come here, come here,
we'll figure it out.

01:05:52.547 --> 01:05:54.115
- I'll get it!
- I got it. I got it!

01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:03.458
Hey.

01:06:04.425 --> 01:06:05.628
Mind if I join you?

01:06:07.494 --> 01:06:09.030
No, I don't mind.

01:06:18.907 --> 01:06:20.076
I love your hair.

01:06:20.909 --> 01:06:22.010
Thanks.

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.581
So how long have you
known Jimmy and Victor?

01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:29.818
God!

01:06:31.018 --> 01:06:32.019
Long time.

01:06:32.519 --> 01:06:34.322
Since junior high.

01:06:34.922 --> 01:06:36.458
Jimmy was my prom date.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.998
He says you're
not from around here.

01:06:43.264 --> 01:06:44.132
No.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.137
I'm just from here, there,
but mostly there.

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:52.307
He says you and Victor
been hanging out a lot.

01:06:53.675 --> 01:06:54.776
Yeah.

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.479
- Victor's a real sweetheart.
- Yeah.

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.015
They're both nice boys.

01:07:00.481 --> 01:07:02.317
So, you know what happened,
then?

01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:06.554
- What do you mean?
- He said it was an act of God.

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:07.890
Hmm.

01:07:10.324 --> 01:07:12.260
It wasn't an act of God.

01:07:13.628 --> 01:07:16.699
Old man was a drunk,
running the same bar.

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:21.403
He was picking them up
at Turtleback Zoo in the winter,

01:07:21.702 --> 01:07:23.871
Jimmy, Victor, their mother.

01:07:24.338 --> 01:07:26.007
He turned up an hour late.

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:29.545
He was drunk
after a day at The Oak.

01:07:30.211 --> 01:07:31.179
He, uh...

01:07:32.146 --> 01:07:33.449
told them to get in the car...

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:37.385
and then he drove it
off the bridge...

01:07:38.219 --> 01:07:39.855
into the fucking Passaic.

01:07:40.588 --> 01:07:41.956
Their parents both died.

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:44.093
Victor was the only one
to make it out,

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:45.894
but he went back in.

01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:48.864
He went back into
the freezing water.

01:07:49.697 --> 01:07:51.065
He pulled Jimmy out.

01:07:51.365 --> 01:07:52.835
- Victor did that?
- Yeah!

01:07:53.467 --> 01:07:54.702
Almost drowned.

01:07:55.336 --> 01:07:57.672
By the time the police
turned up, he was...

01:07:59.574 --> 01:08:01.375
he was floating in the water.

01:08:02.242 --> 01:08:05.246
He'd lost oxygen in his brain,
he went half deaf.

01:08:06.181 --> 01:08:07.449
God...

01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:09.485
that's so sad.

01:08:10.684 --> 01:08:12.387
He saved Jimmy's life.

01:08:15.056 --> 01:08:16.725
I guess there's your act of God.

01:08:25.198 --> 01:08:27.234
Does it bother you, what you do?

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:29.201
Does what bother me?

01:08:29.203 --> 01:08:31.703
Being on your own,
sleeping outside,

01:08:31.706 --> 01:08:33.640
sleeping in strange places.

01:08:34.908 --> 01:08:36.341
No.

01:08:36.344 --> 01:08:38.345
Come on, there's a lot
of crazy people out there.

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:42.183
Yeah, well, they better be
careful, that's all I can say.

01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:43.883
I may not look tough,

01:08:43.885 --> 01:08:45.354
but I'm not afraid
to protect myself.

01:08:48.488 --> 01:08:50.557
My first day
in the park here, you know,

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:51.957
some guy wanted to get high
with me,

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.328
so I was like, yeah, okay.

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.895
We did an A-bomb
and some uppies,

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:58.033
and then he started grabbing me,
and I didn't want him to.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.536
Wasn't really anything, I just
didn't want him touching me,

01:09:01.903 --> 01:09:03.502
and he wouldn't cut it out.

01:09:03.505 --> 01:09:04.770
What'd you do?

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:05.939
Stabbed him.

01:09:07.742 --> 01:09:10.076
What, did he die?

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:12.412
I doubt it,
I stabbed him in the ass.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.149
Someone
stabbed my ass!

01:09:16.117 --> 01:09:18.086
I just might've
given it to him if he asked...

01:09:18.987 --> 01:09:21.321
but some people figure they
can just take what they want,

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:22.591
and who gives a shit?

01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:24.390
But when they take
what they want,

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:25.791
and you're not ready to give,

01:09:25.792 --> 01:09:27.761
then what's taken
can never be replaced.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.631
You stay that way forever.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.133
I look around and I see people
who've been taking,

01:09:34.135 --> 01:09:36.538
and I see people who've been
taken from their whole lives.

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:39.839
I look at you.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:41.210
You look at me how?

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:44.045
- I don't know.
- Come on...

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:46.447
what does that mean?

01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:48.750
I just mean, how long have you
been taking from Jimmy?

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.520
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.190
I meant how long
have you been screwing him

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:58.661
behind your husband's back?

01:10:06.734 --> 01:10:08.268
I don't care
how many drug dealers

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:09.271
you stabbed in the ass,

01:10:10.037 --> 01:10:11.539
you keep your mouth shut.

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:13.475
You come here to make trouble?

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:17.746
You got off on the wrong stop.

01:10:18.846 --> 01:10:20.315
Leave Victor alone.

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:23.485
Stay the fuck away
from Jimmy too.

01:10:24.152 --> 01:10:25.753
Get back on the fucking bus!

01:10:26.721 --> 01:10:27.722
You tramp!

01:10:34.895 --> 01:10:36.163
Thanks for the cigarette.

01:10:54.181 --> 01:10:55.283
Hey, Victor.

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:57.418
I'm a little tired.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:11:00.623
You mind if I go upstairs
and lie on your bed for a while?

01:11:01.956 --> 01:11:02.992
Sure.

01:11:54.909 --> 01:11:57.211
<i>Victor,
I got a good idea.</i>

01:11:58.246 --> 01:11:59.978
Let's bury ourselves,
and then when someone comes by,

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.613
we'll jump out and scare
the crap out of them!

01:12:01.615 --> 01:12:02.784
- Come on!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:11.492
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:24.273
Victor?

01:12:26.106 --> 01:12:27.475
Someone coming?

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:33.449
If you could do anything,
I mean...

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.081
if you had the money to do

01:12:36.083 --> 01:12:37.353
something you always wanted
to do...

01:12:39.087 --> 01:12:40.356
what would it be?

01:12:44.391 --> 01:12:45.327
Like...

01:12:46.194 --> 01:12:47.830
- anything?
- Anything.

01:12:50.064 --> 01:12:51.363
Is there something
you always wanted to do,

01:12:51.365 --> 01:12:52.734
but you
couldn't afford to do it?

01:12:59.474 --> 01:13:01.877
I would wanna buy
Jimmy a new car.

01:13:03.878 --> 01:13:04.746
No.

01:13:05.479 --> 01:13:08.516
Something for yourself,
not necessarily an object but...

01:13:10.518 --> 01:13:12.287
is there someplace
you never been...

01:13:13.387 --> 01:13:15.189
something you always
wanted to see?

01:13:22.463 --> 01:13:25.567
I've... I've never been
to the Grand Ole Opry.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.335
It's in Nashville.

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:30.338
It's where Ernie Tubb
discovered Hank Snow.

01:13:31.072 --> 01:13:32.541
It's where his memorial is.

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.743
Well, let's do it!

01:13:35.076 --> 01:13:36.110
Let's go there!

01:13:37.244 --> 01:13:38.180
Go there?

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:40.249
How?

01:13:41.048 --> 01:13:42.684
Well never mind how.

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:44.052
Listen...

01:13:45.353 --> 01:13:46.421
I have some money.

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.323
It's just money to spend
for something like this. It's...

01:13:49.957 --> 01:13:51.960
money no one cares
about any more.

01:13:53.795 --> 01:13:54.730
Yeah?

01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:57.297
Fuck!

01:13:57.631 --> 01:13:58.634
Come on!

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:06.141
We'll go out,
we'll get all new outfits,

01:14:06.541 --> 01:14:08.911
I'll buy some makeup
and paint my nails.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.780
We'll go get the bus tickets
and we'll leave tomorrow.

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:16.752
Come on.

01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:18.386
Listen...

01:14:21.055 --> 01:14:22.757
this will just be
our little secret, okay?

01:14:24.391 --> 01:14:25.790
<i>But what about Jimmy?</i>

01:14:25.792 --> 01:14:27.125
<i>Don't worry
about Jimmy.</i>

01:14:27.127 --> 01:14:29.063
<i>We'll write Jimmy a postcard.</i>

01:14:51.452 --> 01:14:52.488
Psst!

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:13.642
You like?

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:16.545
Um, you got no pants.

01:15:17.945 --> 01:15:19.146
You like purple, right?

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:21.214
Mm-hmm.

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:23.485
Hey, wait a minute, I got
a few others I wanna show you.

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:26.554
Oh, no.

01:15:27.021 --> 01:15:29.690
Where are you going?
Hey, it's okay.

01:15:30.423 --> 01:15:31.659
We're buds, right?

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:34.730
Victor?

01:15:36.297 --> 01:15:38.533
Haven't you ever seen
a girl undress before?

01:15:39.833 --> 01:15:40.967
It's okay,

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.470
there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

01:15:43.104 --> 01:15:44.239
They're just titties.

01:15:44.639 --> 01:15:46.240
You don't have to be shy.

01:15:50.311 --> 01:15:51.279
Do you wanna touch me, Victor?

01:15:53.014 --> 01:15:56.618
You don't have to,
but if you want to, if you're...

01:15:57.818 --> 01:15:59.087
if you're curious.

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:01.055
Here.

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:05.761
How's that feel?

01:16:09.063 --> 01:16:10.097
Soft, right?

01:16:25.579 --> 01:16:26.582
Victor.

01:16:28.483 --> 01:16:31.186
- Victor, what's the matter?
- Oh, no.

01:16:32.086 --> 01:16:33.221
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, no.

01:16:33.921 --> 01:16:35.356
- Oh, no.
- Victor,

01:16:35.689 --> 01:16:36.856
Victor, look what I made you do.

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:38.090
No, it's not funny.

01:16:38.092 --> 01:16:40.860
Victor, you came!

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:42.527
Victor, you came!

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.738
- Shit! Let's get out of here.
- It's not funny.

01:16:57.878 --> 01:16:58.947
Shh.

01:17:09.823 --> 01:17:12.925
Hey, heads up,
scumbag, you're under arrest.

01:17:12.927 --> 01:17:14.794
- Hiya, Freddy.
- What are you doing there, Vic.

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:16.294
Huh? You staying out of trouble?

01:17:16.296 --> 01:17:17.629
Yeah?

01:17:17.631 --> 01:17:18.830
Hey Vic, when are you
gonna play us something

01:17:18.832 --> 01:17:19.967
on your violin there?

01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:21.601
- Someday.
- No, come on, man,

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:23.538
- I want to hear maestro...
- Nolan, stop!

01:17:24.605 --> 01:17:26.138
Come on, Vic's a good guy.

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.609
But seriously Vic,
Patti says you're pretty good.

01:17:28.909 --> 01:17:30.211
What, do you only
play for the chicks?

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:31.712
No.

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.748
Oh, I don't know,
Patti says you're good.

01:17:34.248 --> 01:17:36.115
What about your girlfriend,
you play for her?

01:17:36.117 --> 01:17:37.619
She's not my girlfriend, Freddy.

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.818
We're just good friends.

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:42.090
Okay, what about Patti?

01:17:42.489 --> 01:17:44.326
Jimmy and Patti
are just good friends, too.

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:46.558
Oh, you fucking knucklehead.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.995
What I'm saying is,
Patti said that you're good,

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:50.798
so she must've heard
you play, right?

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.469
No, she's never heard me
play before.

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:58.140
All right, Victor, you just stay
out of trouble, all right?

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.606
Hey, hold on a second.

01:18:00.608 --> 01:18:02.577
Vic, come here, I just wanna
talk you to for a second, okay?

01:18:07.347 --> 01:18:08.250
Look...

01:18:09.449 --> 01:18:10.318
Vic...

01:18:11.118 --> 01:18:12.319
what'd you mean by...

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.187
"Jimmy and Patti are
just good friends,"

01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:17.659
like I know it's true,
but what does that mean?

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.527
Jimmy...

01:18:21.128 --> 01:18:24.231
Jimmy said him and Patti
are just good friends, Freddy.

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:27.569
Oh, when did he say that?

01:18:30.838 --> 01:18:32.340
See, it's weird to me,
it's like,

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:35.342
why would he say that
like why would he say that

01:18:35.676 --> 01:18:36.976
him and Patti
are just good friends,

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.046
I don't understand.

01:18:39.346 --> 01:18:40.581
Because she's his friend.

01:18:43.484 --> 01:18:44.418
You're right.

01:18:45.052 --> 01:18:47.387
Jesus Christ, sometimes I can
be a knucklehead too, Vic.

01:18:47.721 --> 01:18:50.824
Hey, thanks for your help,
I appreciate it, all right?

01:18:51.492 --> 01:18:53.729
Now you stay outta trouble,
you understand?

01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:58.233
Let's get outta here.

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:51.586
- Oak.
<i>- Jimmy, don't come over.</i>

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.018
<i>It's Freddy.</i>

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.353
- What's the matter, what's up?
<i>- He knows.</i>

01:19:55.355 --> 01:19:57.824
He had a fit,
he was going crazy!

01:19:58.426 --> 01:19:59.960
<i>He said he talked to Victor.</i>

01:20:00.461 --> 01:20:02.297
<i>He said Victor said something.</i>

01:20:04.097 --> 01:20:05.300
He wouldn't listen to me,

01:20:05.466 --> 01:20:07.469
I mean, he was acting
like a fucking maniac!

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:11.640
- Are you all right?
<i>- Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

01:20:12.472 --> 01:20:13.507
Jimmy...

01:20:15.743 --> 01:20:16.844
be careful.

01:20:19.913 --> 01:20:20.849
Fuck!

01:20:41.969 --> 01:20:43.337
Heya, Jimmy.

01:20:44.637 --> 01:20:45.806
How is The Oak?

01:20:46.573 --> 01:20:47.509
Well, Victor...

01:20:48.908 --> 01:20:50.110
if you ever bothered to show up

01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:51.744
once in a while, then you
wouldn't have to ask me,

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:52.681
now would you?

01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:55.149
Does it need any help?

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:56.851
What did you say to Freddy?

01:20:57.118 --> 01:20:58.252
Freddy?

01:20:58.551 --> 01:21:00.353
You said something
to Freddy about me and Patti.

01:21:00.787 --> 01:21:02.289
Now what did you say?

01:21:02.957 --> 01:21:04.159
I just said that...

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:08.496
you said that you and Patti
were just friends.

01:21:11.698 --> 01:21:12.833
You know, Victor...

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:16.503
half the time I talk to you
I get nothing but shrugs,

01:21:17.238 --> 01:21:20.240
but when you open your mouth,
boy, do you open your mouth.

01:21:21.141 --> 01:21:22.840
Now there's a good chance
that when I go in

01:21:22.842 --> 01:21:24.809
to open up tomorrow morning,
Freddy's gonna be there

01:21:24.811 --> 01:21:26.014
to rip my head off.

01:21:26.346 --> 01:21:27.715
- Jimmy, I...
- Just!

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:31.018
do me a favor
and just shut up!

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:33.785
You did enough
goddamn damage for one night!

01:21:33.787 --> 01:21:35.989
Don't yell at me, Jimmy.

01:21:36.222 --> 01:21:37.990
I'm tired of you yelling at me!

01:21:37.992 --> 01:21:40.793
Well then, stop fucking
embarrassing me all the time!

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:43.361
Don't talk to me like that,
Jimmy, I'm your older brother!

01:21:43.363 --> 01:21:44.996
Well then, start acting like it

01:21:44.998 --> 01:21:47.366
and stop being
such a goddamn lummox!

01:21:47.368 --> 01:21:49.536
- Don't you call me that, Jimmy.
- Why not?

01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:51.536
You don't even know
what one means!

01:21:51.538 --> 01:21:53.840
Otherwise you wouldn't
keep acting like one!

01:21:54.975 --> 01:21:57.809
Here, here, people been
calling you one all your life,

01:21:57.811 --> 01:21:59.346
it's about time you look it up!

01:21:59.913 --> 01:22:01.013
Lummox!

01:22:01.015 --> 01:22:02.313
It's under L!

01:22:02.315 --> 01:22:03.251
Look it up!

01:22:06.186 --> 01:22:08.154
I'm not a lummox, Jimmy!

01:22:08.454 --> 01:22:09.823
I'm your brother!

01:22:10.190 --> 01:22:12.626
<i>You're supposed
to take care of me!</i>

01:22:14.595 --> 01:22:16.463
<i>And I'm your older brother!</i>

01:22:17.765 --> 01:22:18.863
<i>You forget that?</i>

01:22:18.865 --> 01:22:20.301
I'm your older brother!

01:22:23.137 --> 01:22:24.471
<i>You don't call me that!</i>

01:22:25.072 --> 01:22:26.608
<i>Huh, Jimmy, you hear me?</i>

01:22:27.274 --> 01:22:28.540
<i>You!</i>

01:22:28.542 --> 01:22:30.010
<i>You don't call me that!</i>

01:24:00.801 --> 01:24:02.202
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

01:24:07.474 --> 01:24:09.411
- What do you wanna do, Freddy?
- I swear to God.

01:24:19.686 --> 01:24:20.954
Go home, Victor.

01:24:22.756 --> 01:24:24.022
You okay, Jimmy?

01:24:24.024 --> 01:24:25.057
I'm fine.

01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:26.795
Jimmy, get Vic outta here.

01:24:28.395 --> 01:24:30.532
- I'm not leaving, Freddy.
- Victor, go home!

01:24:31.198 --> 01:24:32.132
No.

01:24:33.167 --> 01:24:34.666
I'm not leaving, Jimmy.

01:24:34.668 --> 01:24:36.001
Get him outta here, Jimmy!

01:24:36.003 --> 01:24:38.003
- Victor, go home!
- No!

01:24:38.005 --> 01:24:39.539
I'm warning you, Vic,

01:24:39.873 --> 01:24:42.376
this is between me
and your brother, Jimmy.

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:49.680
You leave
my little brother alone.

01:24:49.682 --> 01:24:51.019
Victor, go home!

01:24:51.418 --> 01:24:52.519
No!

01:25:02.061 --> 01:25:03.131
Hey, Freddy?

01:25:04.097 --> 01:25:05.363
What?

01:25:05.365 --> 01:25:06.400
Look, this is important.

01:25:37.163 --> 01:25:38.131
You okay, Jimmy?

01:25:38.731 --> 01:25:41.136
It's over now, just go home.

01:26:28.548 --> 01:26:29.684
Okay.

01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:31.485
It's okay.

01:27:05.886 --> 01:27:07.021
Hey, Jimmy.

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:09.356
What are you doing home?

01:27:10.690 --> 01:27:12.726
I mean, who's watching The Oak?

01:27:13.894 --> 01:27:14.862
That's...

01:27:15.896 --> 01:27:18.466
some shirt
you got there, Victor, that new?

01:27:19.899 --> 01:27:21.435
My friend bought it for me.

01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:23.605
So, the girl?

01:27:29.409 --> 01:27:30.912
What's the matter, Jimmy?

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:32.913
Sit down, Victor.

01:27:34.047 --> 01:27:35.148
You okay?

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:42.923
Listen...

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:46.561
there's no easy way
to tell you this...

01:27:47.828 --> 01:27:49.297
so I'm just gonna say it.

01:27:50.597 --> 01:27:51.698
Your friend...

01:27:56.770 --> 01:27:58.072
someone hurt her.

01:27:59.573 --> 01:28:00.708
What?

01:28:01.007 --> 01:28:04.112
They found her body
behind the... train station.

01:28:05.378 --> 01:28:07.914
You understand
what that means, her body?

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.922
Are they sure that it was her?

01:28:16.856 --> 01:28:17.958
They know.

01:31:22.943 --> 01:31:24.979
Any idea who'd do
something like that, Freddy?

01:31:25.679 --> 01:31:28.649
No, you hang out
with strange people like that,

01:31:29.483 --> 01:31:30.685
shit I see every day.

01:31:31.885 --> 01:31:33.855
Shanked, parents wanted
nothing to do with her.

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:35.489
Hey Jimmy,

01:31:36.423 --> 01:31:37.890
how's Victor taking all this?

01:31:38.190 --> 01:31:39.292
Is he holding up?

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:41.462
Not well...

01:31:42.162 --> 01:31:43.331
he's, uh...

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:46.367
just said it's an act of God.

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:51.805
Maybe someone
should go check on him.

01:31:52.105 --> 01:31:53.873
I'm gonna take him out
to Doodle Eve's today,

01:31:54.207 --> 01:31:55.809
get his mind off things.

01:31:56.909 --> 01:31:58.011
That poor girl.

01:31:59.579 --> 01:32:01.548
Every time I think
about being mean to her...

01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:04.886
Never even knew her name.

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:09.489
Judge ye not.

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:17.618
Careful, Vic.

01:34:36.336 --> 01:34:37.570
What's on your mind, Victor?

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:43.877
You know you can talk to me
about anything, don't you, Vic?

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:46.579
I mean, we're brothers, right?

01:34:50.617 --> 01:34:52.319
That night
you didn't come home...

01:34:54.954 --> 01:34:56.256
and we lost our money?

01:35:00.793 --> 01:35:01.996
Yeah, I remember.

01:35:05.698 --> 01:35:07.367
You wasn't with Patti.

01:35:11.938 --> 01:35:12.873
No...

01:35:14.006 --> 01:35:15.341
I wasn't with Patti.

01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:25.585
I'm sorry, Victor.

01:35:40.567 --> 01:35:42.733
It wasn't enough that you tried

01:35:42.735 --> 01:35:44.237
to take Patti away from Freddy?

01:35:45.271 --> 01:35:47.742
It wasn't enough that
you're the handsome brother?

01:35:48.608 --> 01:35:50.578
That you are the smart brother?

01:35:51.878 --> 01:35:53.745
It wasn't enough
that you are the brother

01:35:53.747 --> 01:35:55.783
I almost died for that day?

01:36:13.198 --> 01:36:15.167
I know I'm different, Jimmy.

01:36:16.269 --> 01:36:18.606
I know that I'm what
people call stupid...

01:36:22.609 --> 01:36:25.646
but sometimes people don't know
that I know that.

01:36:28.114 --> 01:36:30.915
But I'm smart enough
not to have thought

01:36:30.917 --> 01:36:32.152
that a girl like that...

01:36:34.854 --> 01:36:37.691
would ever fall in love
with someone like me.

01:36:41.493 --> 01:36:44.164
I know what a lummox is, Jimmy.

01:36:45.465 --> 01:36:47.168
I know that I am one.

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:52.338
It was just nice
that someone like her

01:36:52.905 --> 01:36:54.608
didn't treat me like one.

01:36:58.511 --> 01:36:59.646
I, uh...

01:37:02.949 --> 01:37:05.185
I guess I never really talked
about it with you...

01:37:06.118 --> 01:37:07.320
like we should've.

01:37:09.323 --> 01:37:10.691
Like brothers should've.

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:32.046
I miss Grandma, Jimmy.

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:36.517
She was good to us.

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:42.256
She wasn't nothing,
but a little old lady, but...

01:37:43.523 --> 01:37:45.926
when she died
I didn't feel safe no more.

01:37:48.828 --> 01:37:49.730
Sometimes...

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:54.702
I wish I could
un-ring that bell.

01:38:31.136 --> 01:38:32.773
Sorry I haven't been
a good brother to you...

01:38:35.408 --> 01:38:36.844
but I tried, Vic.

01:38:39.345 --> 01:38:40.747
I really tried.

01:38:56.095 --> 01:38:59.500
Only the mediocre
are always at their best.

01:39:18.917 --> 01:39:20.550
Oh, be careful, Jimmy.

01:39:44.644 --> 01:39:46.213
- Hiya, Leo.
- Vic.

01:39:57.323 --> 01:40:01.362
Hey, Leo, you getting
any Hank Snow records in?

01:40:02.095 --> 01:40:03.063
Yeah.

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:06.467
What?

01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:11.102
It's an import from Japan,
promotional picture disc,

01:40:11.104 --> 01:40:14.072
it's got ol' Hank burned
right there into the hot wax.

01:40:14.439 --> 01:40:16.141
Would you like to hold it maybe?

01:40:16.842 --> 01:40:18.811
Gotta be
real careful though, okay?

01:40:19.779 --> 01:40:23.179
That there's the holy shit,
Holy Grail of all Hank vinyl,

01:40:23.181 --> 01:40:25.485
very, very rare.

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:27.855
- How much?
- Phew.

01:40:30.422 --> 01:40:31.692
It's on me, Vic.

01:40:33.426 --> 01:40:34.427
Thank you, Leo.

01:40:34.926 --> 01:40:36.162
Who gives you joy?

01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:38.798
- You.
- Who?

01:40:39.298 --> 01:40:40.900
- You do, Leo.
- Thank you.

01:40:41.301 --> 01:40:43.470
Okay, get outta here,
go listen to your record.

01:40:46.639 --> 01:40:48.542
- See ya', Leo.
- Okay.

01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:52.910
