01:10.470 --> 01:12.370
When you see this

01:15.275 --> 01:16.537
You have the illusion of light

01:44.471 --> 01:51.434
BEYOND REALITY

02:04.424 --> 02:06.289
Friday, at 10 pm

02:07.260 --> 02:08.386
People will spend the night in the casino

02:08.495 --> 02:11.362
And that means, I'll be very sleepy tonight.

02:13.433 --> 02:16.334
It's been three months working in this casino.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.294
Everything is serious here

02:18.404 --> 02:20.269
CCTV is everywhere

02:20.373 --> 02:22.307
The security guards, the navy alumni

02:22.442 --> 02:24.342
And I know everybody

02:24.511 --> 02:26.411
Hi, Richie! How is your wife?

02:27.347 --> 02:28.405
And everyone knows me

02:29.282 --> 02:31.307
In a way, we're a big happy family

02:31.518 --> 02:33.383
Richie is in charge of Blackjack

02:33.486 --> 02:34.350
His back is not healthy

02:34.487 --> 02:36.421
So I have to help set up a scrambler.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.346
Diana

02:38.491 --> 02:40.254
responsible betting table

02:40.460 --> 02:42.428
He is my main problem

02:43.329 --> 02:45.456
Because everyone knows I'm in love with her.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.490
But you know what my mom told me?

02:48.501 --> 02:50.469
If a woman ignores you

02:52.438 --> 02:53.427
He might like you

02:56.476 --> 03:00.344
I would deem silence - 'may'

03:01.314 --> 03:04.283
But it seems he is not ready for a serious relationship.

03:09.455 --> 03:12.288
Tn. Gold. The most demanding customers.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.290
But I've learned all the complications.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.387
And I am the one who is always told to serve him

03:20.266 --> 03:22.461
Sometimes I hear something I should not hear.

03:23.436 --> 03:27.372
But I do not interfere, and I will keep it a secret

03:29.409 --> 03:32.276
So, in general. Everything is fine

03:33.379 --> 03:34.505
But there is one thing

03:36.282 --> 03:39.376
In the real world, my name is Michael

03:40.320 --> 03:41.412
And I'm a con-artist

03:44.290 --> 03:45.450
Rich's lower back made him feel pain

03:46.326 --> 03:49.489
But it helps me. If not, I will not be able to approach the scrambler.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.391
Con is also a game

04:04.410 --> 04:06.435
I have prepared this moment for 3 months

04:14.454 --> 04:16.353
The first step, Fireworks

04:43.349 --> 04:45.317
Can I join?

04:49.422 --> 04:51.253
The second step, Miracle Craps

04:55.461 --> 04:58.328
According to Diana, I came to Crap's shirt to tease her

04:59.299 --> 05:00.391
But I love money more

05:01.434 --> 05:03.334
Much more loving money

05:19.285 --> 05:20.377
Congratulations, sir

05:23.389 --> 05:25.289
It's my lucky day, right?

05:35.268 --> 05:36.462
The third step, VIP Card

05:38.438 --> 05:40.497
I've been investigating

05:41.374 --> 05:44.309
I have so many ideas that I want to do to him

05:45.311 --> 05:47.370
But, I'm not a greedy person

05:48.381 --> 05:49.473
After the mess I made

05:50.283 --> 05:52.342
Card games will be accepted throughout the casino

05:53.519 --> 05:57.216
We are having a technical annoyance. Please go to IT room.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.291
While the explorers find out what happened

05:59.459 --> 06:02.485
The richest customers are invited to the VIP room

06:03.363 --> 06:04.295
That's what I need

06:09.435 --> 06:12.233
Maybe this trick is very old

06:12.505 --> 06:15.269
And the guards are now looking for who the Con Artist is

06:16.309 --> 06:21.246
They will succeed. But this is part of my plan.

06:21.514 --> 06:23.448
Fourth step, Elevator

06:44.437 --> 06:48.373
- Where is the VIP hall? It's an elevator for the waiter, sir

06:48.474 --> 06:49.441
Is it true?

06:50.343 --> 06:53.437
How can I know which elevator is for the maid, and who is not for the maid

06:54.313 --> 06:58.215
It's just a misunderstanding, do not worry, sir. I'll take you upstairs

06:58.384 --> 06:59.408
Yes, it should be so

07:14.534 --> 07:16.263
Okay, what happened?

07:16.436 --> 07:20.270
- Sir, please be patient for a moment. Do not tell me to be patient, I will

07:21.240 --> 07:24.266
God, this can not be trusted

07:24.377 --> 07:26.345
- Gosh .... Be cool, sir

07:26.546 --> 07:28.446
- You see? Everything is alright. - Fuck!

07:30.316 --> 07:33.410
- The VIP hall is on ... Yeah, I know, you're stupid

07:37.490 --> 07:38.422
The real chaos begins

07:39.325 --> 07:41.384
Right after everyone thought it was over.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.353
Please, the card

07:56.442 --> 07:59.411
Bingo, all I need is the same desk

08:01.380 --> 08:03.371
This is a place for high level affairs

08:05.384 --> 08:07.443
The chips are very valuable

08:09.288 --> 08:12.280
Thanks to Diana, I have enough capital to bet on

08:14.260 --> 08:17.229
As long as I work here, I learn my opponents well

08:23.503 --> 08:26.301
Nobody knows me, but they are like family to me.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.401
Step Five, Modern Technology

08:39.318 --> 08:43.448
God, this is amazing..I flew 3000 miles

08:44.290 --> 08:46.349
just to get trapped inside the elevator

08:47.293 --> 08:50.319
God, this can not be trusted

08:50.496 --> 08:52.396
- Sir, please calm down ... No, you just calm down

09:07.480 --> 09:09.414
The main thing is not to win every time

09:10.349 --> 09:11.338
You have to be sure

09:11.484 --> 09:12.473
You got a good chance

09:14.320 --> 09:16.254
Then, add your bet

09:34.473 --> 09:36.304
I see this is a serious game

09:37.243 --> 09:39.234
Though I think this is a place to have fun.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.241
Maybe we can consider

10:23.522 --> 10:25.456
All in

10:30.496 --> 10:32.293
All in

10:41.374 --> 10:43.467
I heard Dr. Ed has lost his license again

10:44.310 --> 10:46.403
From my father, then my brothers, and now you!

10:48.481 --> 10:50.449
Maybe you also want to give me advice?

10:54.520 --> 10:56.420
If I can give you advice

10:57.356 --> 10:58.482
When in doubt, do not do it!

11:00.292 --> 11:01.281
Based on my experience

11:02.528 --> 11:05.292
Especially if it's the last one you've got.

11:05.531 --> 11:08.329
If I need your advice I will ask you.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.435
Welcome

11:26.485 --> 11:28.510
You should hear the advice of the wise.

11:42.334 --> 11:45.360
What are you doing? - This father won.

11:50.342 --> 11:53.311
Do not think too much, it's just money

11:54.513 --> 11:57.380
Bring up. Thank you, ba pa k-ba pak

12:25.277 --> 12:26.437
Why are you doing this to me? Where's my money?

12:27.246 --> 12:28.304
Take this, just take it all

12:33.252 --> 12:34.514
Where's my money? - I do not know.

12:42.328 --> 12:46.264
No, not me. He!

12:46.432 --> 12:48.491
No, no!

12:53.539 --> 12:55.370
I'm the owner of this casino

12:56.375 --> 12:57.342
My name is Victor

12:58.544 --> 13:00.341
Where is the money?

13:02.281 --> 13:03.248
I do not know

13:03.382 --> 13:04.314
Have you tried looking in the bank?

13:06.385 --> 13:09.377
Look, I'm one of your VIP clients

13:09.488 --> 13:12.321
I'm on my way to victory

13:12.424 --> 13:14.415
and then there was the con artist who thwarted my victory

13:14.527 --> 13:18.258
What kind of operation do you run here?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.365
God, your hand is so hard

13:22.434 --> 13:23.423
Hear

13:24.370 --> 13:25.462
A Con-man, take everything

13:26.472 --> 13:28.406
He's what you should be looking for, not me

13:32.378 --> 13:35.438
You make me rugilebih more than 5 million Euros.

13:38.517 --> 13:42.351
I have to compensate the players, for their defeat.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.481
You have to return all the money to me.

13:48.260 --> 13:49.522
You have 1 week

13:52.464 --> 13:53.488
APa7

13:54.366 --> 13:55.333
One week?

13:56.268 --> 13:58.463
It took 3 months to play this all

13:59.305 --> 14:00.363
okay, okay, I got it

14:02.474 --> 14:03.441
Okay

14:05.344 --> 14:09.246
I have to say this, if I try to hide,

14:09.348 --> 14:10.337
we will find you

14:11.417 --> 14:14.409
You're an intelligent person, you know what I mean.

14:21.260 --> 14:24.457
7 Day Countdown begins

14:35.374 --> 14:36.398
Hello

14:43.382 --> 14:44.508
A very good welcome

15:16.448 --> 15:19.315
Mayki?

15:19.485 --> 15:21.282
Mayki

15:21.453 --> 15:23.421
- How are you? Nice to meet you again

15:24.290 --> 15:27.225
What are you doing? You do not know him?

15:27.326 --> 15:30.352
He is the best collector in history

15:32.298 --> 15:34.323
They do not make people like this anymore.

15:38.304 --> 15:41.364
Mayki, I think we will never meet again.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.433
You should be on an island somewhere.

15:50.382 --> 15:51.474
LEO!!

15:53.285 --> 15:54.513
What does this symbol mean?

15:59.358 --> 16:00.382
Wait here

16:10.369 --> 16:12.269
Now, tell me! What's really going on?

16:16.408 --> 16:18.433
I do not know, replaced the card in my hand

16:20.512 --> 16:23.345
He changed your visual perception

16:27.319 --> 16:30.288
Okay, psychic says

16:30.489 --> 16:33.458
fortune teller, or magic practitioner

16:35.327 --> 16:41.357
who are born with a talent for entering the subconscious,

16:43.235 --> 16:46.295
It was like a room

16:47.306 --> 16:50.332
Where you are allowed to perform any supernatural activity.

16:51.410 --> 16:55.346
So, the con-man, has the ability

16:55.514 --> 16:58.506
To change what everyone sees,

17:01.487 --> 17:04.319
Leon, why do not you just tell me, where can I find him?

17:04.490 --> 17:05.513
This is not a fairy tale

17:06.425 --> 17:07.449
More precisely is the legend

17:08.359 --> 17:11.261
We are all encompassed by the subconscious

17:11.497 --> 17:15.433
And all the things that can not be explained,

17:16.300 --> 17:19.395
And people with this ability can come out of the conscious realm,

17:19.538 --> 17:21.403
leading to the collective unconscious

17:22.540 --> 17:24.338
It's like an infinite universe

17:24.476 --> 17:26.501
That will open unlimited possibilities.

17:27.346 --> 17:30.315
And access to all unlimited human knowledge.

17:31.316 --> 17:33.477
Normal people can also enter the subconscious

17:34.353 --> 17:36.514
But they did not get out there without a special talisman.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.381
A special kind of compass

17:48.534 --> 17:49.523
Come on, Leon

17:50.369 --> 17:51.495
Seriously

17:52.371 --> 17:54.271
Is my 5 million money also there?

17:54.540 --> 17:59.375
Here there is all information about the activities of Normal, and those with i1 capabilities

18:00.546 --> 18:02.514
Just read it, dikantoranu

18:03.449 --> 18:05.508
Now, I have a business

18:25.437 --> 18:29.396
Alex, does everything go well?

18:30.442 --> 18:31.431
As usual

18:33.345 --> 18:34.334
It's your 5 million

18:35.314 --> 18:39.512
Did he give you trouble? - He's as talented as me,

18:43.322 --> 18:45.313
By the way, what is he doing?

18:47.426 --> 18:49.291
I think he's trying to get rid of the problem now.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.354
Who says - I'm pretty sure.

18:53.265 --> 18:56.462
No problems in Las Vegasyang can not be solved.

19:08.247 --> 19:11.239
This suitcase, skin quality is better

19:24.263 --> 19:26.322
I have not seen a thing like that for a long time.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.493
I circled half of this world to get it

19:31.270 --> 19:34.296
Do you think you're the only one who can use this?

19:36.408 --> 19:39.400
All right, do you agree to teach me?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.505
You do not need to be too stiff

19:45.417 --> 19:47.385
I offer this world to you

19:48.453 --> 19:50.250
To save me

19:50.522 --> 19:52.319
Shows the world you know

19:55.260 --> 19:56.318
We work a lot together

19:57.296 --> 19:59.287
And if you do not come back, who will I work for?

20:00.399 --> 20:03.459
I'll be safe with this, right?

20:04.403 --> 20:05.392
No

20:06.305 --> 20:07.329
It's not safe enough

20:07.539 --> 20:08.506
You need a partner

20:09.341 --> 20:10.308
And I can not be me

20:10.509 --> 20:13.307
Someone you can rely on someone you can trust.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.242
Someone who really loves you

20:16.481 --> 20:19.450
Do you have someone like that? - I will work on it.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.444
Are you sure you want to do this?

20:28.327 --> 20:29.385
When I was a kid

20:30.295 --> 20:32.229
I have a two volume book

20:32.431 --> 20:33.455
IHD Walls

20:35.367 --> 20:40.304
The other one I always remember all my life

20:41.406 --> 20:43.271
The story of a boy

20:44.276 --> 20:45.334
a lonely dreamer

20:48.447 --> 20:52.315
One day, he met someone

20:52.484 --> 20:55.317
which entered from the right door

20:55.554 --> 20:59.285
And then he realized that he was in magic.

20:59.491 --> 21:00.480
In the world he lives in

21:02.327 --> 21:04.295
He was amazed by what he saw

21:05.497 --> 21:07.226
He loves to be there

21:07.432 --> 21:08.490
How did he get back?

21:11.270 --> 21:17.300
She looked up and found herself back

21:18.410 --> 21:19.468
He's very lucky

21:21.346 --> 21:22.313
Maybe

21:24.283 --> 21:26.444
But when compared with your ability,

21:28.420 --> 21:31.218
I feel he's nothing

21:32.257 --> 21:34.316
That magic door

21:35.460 --> 21:37.428
He wants to be a great kid

21:37.529 --> 21:39.497
and I do not want to do the same thing

21:40.299 --> 21:41.391
You understand?

21:42.467 --> 21:44.492
Especially because now we have this

21:47.272 --> 21:48.296
It's nothing

21:48.540 --> 21:51.509
It will help you show direction in the unconscious world. But without a partner ....

21:53.312 --> 21:54.438
You can never come back

21:55.514 --> 21:57.379
It will be more challenging

22:00.252 --> 22:02.277
6 DAYS

22:16.535 --> 22:18.298
What are you doing?

22:19.404 --> 22:20.393
I did it for you

22:21.273 --> 22:24.333
You'll never know if someone is spying on you

22:28.413 --> 22:32.406
Have you found your conman?

22:35.454 --> 22:38.287
No, no, just

22:39.324 --> 22:40.450
Just a few people I do not know

22:43.261 --> 22:44.523
Are you sure this is real?

22:47.366 --> 22:48.424
You're insulting me now!

22:49.501 --> 22:51.435
All the goods here are lively

22:52.337 --> 22:55.397
I saw everything with my own eyes.

22:56.308 --> 22:59.334
And some of them. Some of these beautiful freaks

22:59.544 --> 23:01.444
I see them myself

23:02.280 --> 23:03.269
Directly

23:04.249 --> 23:07.275
Luckily you said that to me. I saw them in your casino.

23:18.363 --> 23:20.263
- What? Bella!

23:21.299 --> 23:22.425
I'm stupid

23:26.538 --> 23:28.472
Hey, what are you doing with my X-Files?

23:30.308 --> 23:31.502
Okay, this is what I think

23:33.311 --> 23:34.437
Being a host is an opportunity

23:35.247 --> 23:37.272
but sometimes it takes time that I do not have.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.314
I only have one week

23:38.550 --> 23:41.451
But what if I can change the time to plan

23:43.255 --> 23:44.415
With the capabilities it has

23:46.324 --> 23:50.226
For example, can not this guy move things?

23:51.463 --> 23:54.432
He can certainly make the dice move

23:55.300 --> 23:57.291
I have no idea

23:59.504 --> 24:02.337
Roulette Ball

24:04.242 --> 24:06.267
Eric, rich kid

24:07.245 --> 24:08.507
Son of a famous businessman

24:09.414 --> 24:11.439
Father wants to promote his family's business

24:12.484 --> 24:14.349
But Eric is a spoiled child

24:14.486 --> 24:16.283
He does not want to work

24:16.488 --> 24:18.456
He wants to have fun for the rest of his life.

24:19.424 --> 24:21.415
You will not be able to bribe him with money

24:37.442 --> 24:38.500
Why did not you go on with the party?

24:41.413 --> 24:42.380
Who are you?

24:45.283 --> 24:48.480
Let's just say I'm your good dewy mother,

24:49.287 --> 24:50.447
who saved you from the glass tower

24:51.289 --> 24:53.314
and who opened the world of adventure

24:54.426 --> 24:56.360
Your talents will be needed

24:58.263 --> 25:01.232
My mother was like a hormonal problem

25:02.267 --> 25:04.235
If you want to listen to my dongs

25:05.537 --> 25:07.471
Rather than having to hear the funny joke from your father

25:11.510 --> 25:14.445
Okay, this guy, his name is Tony

25:15.313 --> 25:17.304
He can control electronic devices.

25:19.317 --> 25:20.511
So, he will not get caught on camera?

25:26.258 --> 25:27.486
He's a bit coward

25:28.460 --> 25:31.327
He was just brave with the little things

25:31.463 --> 25:33.328
Make glass move faster

25:34.266 --> 25:35.392
In order to break through the red light

25:57.489 --> 26:00.322
Where are you going?

26:09.301 --> 26:12.361
It would have been difficult for a supirtaksi to pay for his children's schooling

26:15.440 --> 26:17.203
What do you want?

26:22.480 --> 26:24.345
What is your ability name?

26:25.283 --> 26:26.272
What is Bilocation?

26:27.385 --> 26:28.409
Supertition?

26:29.254 --> 26:31.381
You can control electronic devices remotely, right?

26:32.524 --> 26:34.321
I do not understand what you mean

26:36.428 --> 26:37.452
Are you from the police?

26:39.331 --> 26:41.231
I did not do anything - not at all.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.300
I have a quote for you

26:52.377 --> 26:53.401
He can read people's minds

26:56.314 --> 26:58.407
That would really help you playing poker, right?

27:00.352 --> 27:02.445
Can he also control the minds of people?

27:03.421 --> 27:06.481
For example, desire to raise a stick?

27:07.359 --> 27:08.348
Her name is Tamara

27:08.526 --> 27:11.495
But he works side by side for secret police, in whatever country

27:12.464 --> 27:14.364
But he is very old

27:15.500 --> 27:18.298
Are you sure you want to bring it to the casino?

27:20.338 --> 27:22.397
You need it. Hypnotist

27:24.309 --> 27:25.298
His name is Kevin

27:26.344 --> 27:28.278
But he's crazy

27:28.346 --> 27:30.371
She has autism, that sort of thing

27:31.349 --> 27:32.441
Her parents locked her up

27:33.385 --> 27:34.477
The doctors used it

27:35.520 --> 27:39.354
Whatever program will be depressed.

27:40.291 --> 27:41.349
This is a good business for you

27:42.260 --> 27:44.251
They'll do anything for Kevin.

27:50.535 --> 27:51.502
He is 50 years old

27:52.470 --> 27:55.303
No, he's only 45 years old

27:56.274 --> 27:57.241
She just drank too much

27:58.276 --> 28:00.244
When he was drunk he would beat his wife

28:01.413 --> 28:03.278
This is not the first time he has come to see you

28:03.515 --> 28:05.380
But this time he came to see you

28:05.483 --> 28:06.507
You plant the idea in his mind

28:07.385 --> 28:08.317
So they do not drink

28:09.254 --> 28:10.414
But it does not last long, right?

28:12.257 --> 28:13.485
Can you get them to play?

28:18.263 --> 28:20.493
Gambling will make their energy maximized in different ways

28:21.266 --> 28:23.359
He will stop drinking, he will stop beating his wife

28:24.302 --> 28:25.360
And everyone will be happy

28:48.460 --> 28:49.484
let's play

28:51.362 --> 28:53.421
TwoEnam

28:55.400 --> 28:57.300
Add it

28:59.304 --> 29:00.464
Kevin, come with me

29:01.506 --> 29:04.236
Kevin, listen! We can be a good team, right?

29:04.342 --> 29:06.207
- Yeah. You want me to take you away from here?

29:09.547 --> 29:12.243
I want to, but they will not let me out.

29:13.318 --> 29:16.344
- I'm supposed to help people. Nobody has the right to keep you here

29:16.521 --> 29:18.421
You and I are going around the world

29:18.523 --> 29:20.354
And help people play and win

29:25.363 --> 29:27.354
Kevin, Kevin

29:29.367 --> 29:30.334
I need help

29:32.270 --> 29:33.259
Okay

29:34.339 --> 29:35.363
Okay, let's go

29:38.309 --> 29:39.401
Hey! Stop!

29:40.512 --> 29:43.345
I said stop! Get him! - Come on!

29:43.515 --> 29:45.312
They should give better food,

29:45.416 --> 29:46.280
and cable TV

29:46.384 --> 29:48.318
And let you go out into town

29:48.419 --> 29:49.511
am I right? Say Yes!

29:50.488 --> 29:51.455
The word ka n ya!

29:58.263 --> 29:59.389
Come on, we gotta go!

30:00.298 --> 30:02.391
Do not stop fighting! You have the right!

30:35.266 --> 30:37.257
5 DAYS

30:40.538 --> 30:43.371
Well, we'll start doing business

30:45.276 --> 30:47.471
What we will do is not break the law

30:48.379 --> 30:50.313
No one is sure that this is possible

30:51.382 --> 30:53.373
But the risk will get smaller if we do it as a team.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.216
Casino does not recognize the team

30:57.388 --> 31:01.290
So we have to do it each

31:03.361 --> 31:06.387
That's easy. Where will we start?

31:08.499 --> 31:12.333
Craps, some players will turn, while others ...

31:13.304 --> 31:15.363
put up bets, and everything is possible.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.306
A good number to start

31:57.382 --> 31:59.475
Okay, not bad for the initial experiment.

32:00.285 --> 32:03.311
Okay, let's simulate the original casino.

32:04.389 --> 32:07.358
Eric, if you play the dice, try not to attract too much attention.

32:07.525 --> 32:09.493
If you see something unusual, raise your hand.

32:10.328 --> 32:11.386
You two will help me at the poker table

32:12.497 --> 32:15.261
No way, I have not done it for a long time.

32:16.267 --> 32:17.461
Very good. Kevin

32:50.401 --> 32:52.426
If you look like this in a casino,

32:53.438 --> 32:55.406
Security will soon find out.

32:58.376 --> 33:00.310
That's why we have Tony

33:00.445 --> 33:02.436
Tony, did you see the camera on the side?

33:03.247 --> 33:04.305
Can you divert it from us?

33:44.355 --> 33:45.481
Okay

33:46.424 --> 33:47.413
let's play

33:53.364 --> 33:54.353
Where is the chip?

33:55.466 --> 33:57.297
Give me 10, honey

33:59.337 --> 34:00.429
Okay, here's the money

34:07.378 --> 34:09.369
If it looks weird, I'll call for security

34:09.514 --> 34:11.277
Okay Tony! Watch the camera

34:11.516 --> 34:13.313
Kevin, distract

34:14.385 --> 34:16.284
- Try to be more careful. - OK

34:18.322 --> 34:19.482
I have a fullhouse

34:20.491 --> 34:22.254
Shit!

34:31.369 --> 34:33.268
Put your bets on!

34:53.424 --> 34:54.447
This is mine

34:55.259 --> 34:56.418
Leon!

34:58.296 --> 34:59.320
Okay, you're great!

34:59.464 --> 35:01.295
Now try to continue without me

35:13.311 --> 35:15.302
Okay, let's play!

35:16.447 --> 35:17.436
Put your bets on!

35:20.251 --> 35:22.242
I bet six. Put your bet!

35:23.454 --> 35:28.482
- Kevin, you screwed it up. Here, just wear this. It costs 200 Euro

35:29.293 --> 35:30.351
- Give it to me! -I do not want your watch

35:36.534 --> 35:39.230
My eyes, I can not see whatsoever

35:40.538 --> 35:42.438
What are you doing?

35:43.341 --> 35:45.366
We'll play once more, okay?

35:47.378 --> 35:50.313
Shit! Tony! I can see it! Switch the camera

35:50.448 --> 35:51.506
What are you doing to me?

35:52.450 --> 35:57.285
I will kill you! give it to me!

35:57.388 --> 35:58.446
What are you doing?

36:03.461 --> 36:05.292
Shit!

36:12.336 --> 36:16.466
I do not know, in their supervision somewhat orderly,

36:20.344 --> 36:22.278
But somehow they can be stronger.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.414
Makes me a little worried

36:27.318 --> 36:30.515
What if we put a hearing aid in their ears.

36:31.422 --> 36:33.356
Now this is not that much noticed anymore

36:48.239 --> 36:49.331
Can he distract himself?

36:52.443 --> 36:53.501
Tamara?

36:57.415 --> 36:59.280
Where does he live?

37:31.315 --> 37:34.512
4 DAYS

37:48.332 --> 37:50.232
Veronica, you have to help me

37:50.401 --> 37:51.425
You have to help me, Veronica!

37:52.403 --> 37:53.427
- Tamara and I ... Do not bother me!

37:53.537 --> 37:55.300
Whatever the price, I can pay

37:56.474 --> 37:58.374
Come on Veronica. We do not have much time

38:47.391 --> 38:48.449
Where is he? Where did he go?

39:02.406 --> 39:03.430
I think you're missing something

39:05.476 --> 39:06.443
I'm not their friend

39:18.322 --> 39:19.289
Why are they chasing you?

39:22.426 --> 39:24.223
Come on, I just want to help

39:24.462 --> 39:26.225
And I have an offer for you

39:30.401 --> 39:32.232
You can not even help yourself

39:32.503 --> 39:34.403
The casino, your father

39:35.306 --> 39:36.364
Go to hell!

39:38.309 --> 39:39.435
Now I know why I have to chase you.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.245
Why your grandma can live

39:45.249 --> 39:46.375
He did it for the rest of his life, right?

39:48.452 --> 39:50.283
And now no one is protecting you

39:52.323 --> 39:54.291
I promise she'll be glad.

39:55.292 --> 39:56.281
Please listen to me

39:56.394 --> 40:00.262
You can earn money, and start a new life, away from here

40:06.437 --> 40:09.429
Excuse me sir, I lost my passport. Can you help me? I need your help!

40:35.332 --> 40:39.359
This must be fate

40:40.471 --> 40:41.460
Have you considered my offer?

40:44.475 --> 40:46.466
Come on! Believe me, okay?

40:49.447 --> 40:51.210
No

40:54.485 --> 40:56.350
3 DAYS

41:20.444 --> 41:24.278
Thinking is karmabagi yourself.

41:29.453 --> 41:30.511
Is the exhibit finished?

41:31.322 --> 41:32.380
Yes, I'm sorry sir. We're closed

41:33.290 --> 41:36.384
Too bad I'm late. Akudatang from afar and my plane delay

41:36.494 --> 41:38.257
Sorry

41:39.363 --> 41:40.455
The hypnotist will come to you

41:41.432 --> 41:43.491
And will sendmuke the unconscious world.

41:44.401 --> 41:47.370
Find a room under your subconscious for the person you need

41:47.538 --> 41:50.234
And now, they are in your power

41:50.407 --> 41:52.432
N0m0l` Satll

41:53.511 --> 41:54.478
Number two

42:06.457 --> 42:07.424
But remember

42:08.359 --> 42:09.485
You only have a few minutes

42:35.486 --> 42:37.215
Can you stand up, sir?

42:38.255 --> 42:39.347
Can you stand up?

42:42.326 --> 42:44.385
I am fine

42:45.262 --> 42:45.523
Everything is alright

42:46.397 --> 42:48.456
Hey, why did you go there?

42:49.466 --> 42:51.366
Forgive me!

42:52.336 --> 42:53.496
Yes, of course

43:21.265 --> 43:23.529
Incredible, almost like the original copy.

43:25.336 --> 43:27.497
I do not know how I made it

43:30.474 --> 43:33.238
This is your unintentional masterpiece.

43:33.544 --> 43:35.375
Extraordinary

43:36.246 --> 43:39.409
I'll give you 500 Europads to buy this painting

43:40.284 --> 43:41.342
Agree?

43:42.286 --> 43:43.310
Agree

44:02.406 --> 44:03.464
You are a wonderful friend

44:08.345 --> 44:09.437
Can you shut up for a minute?

44:13.484 --> 44:15.213
Can we talk?

44:15.452 --> 44:17.283
Too many people are here

44:25.262 --> 44:26.354
I have to go

44:34.405 --> 44:36.236
All right, everybody

44:36.440 --> 44:37.498
This is Veronica

44:38.442 --> 44:41.377
I do not know how, but he can read and transmit thoughts.

44:42.379 --> 44:44.438
He will come in our game

44:45.349 --> 44:50.252
Before we enter the casino, we must make sure to dance in the same rhythm.

44:51.255 --> 44:54.224
Veronica, you say there are too many people here?

44:59.263 --> 45:00.457
I think I have an idea

45:02.466 --> 45:03.455
Let's dance

46:14.271 --> 46:16.330
Get Eric to hit the Konceng! - Eric, the bell!

46:25.382 --> 46:30.479
Tell Kevin to make 2 people shout for help- Kevin tells 2 people to shout for help!

46:36.493 --> 46:38.484
Please

46:42.432 --> 46:45.492
Get Tony to make a short-circuit-Tony, shorted!

46:59.316 --> 47:02.217
Veronica, we need an earthquake now everybody goes from this field.

47:04.488 --> 47:08.254
Earthquake

47:09.393 --> 47:12.294
Earthquake

47:14.331 --> 47:15.320
Earthquake!

47:16.466 --> 47:20.425
Earthquake!

47:22.472 --> 47:24.372
Earthquake!

47:25.242 --> 47:26.266
Earthquake!

47:51.535 --> 47:53.366
Not bad either

47:56.506 --> 47:58.303
I'll treat you to a drink

48:08.452 --> 48:11.353
All right, here's the plan

48:11.521 --> 48:13.489
If we start by winning in small amounts.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.260
It will take a long time

48:18.528 --> 48:21.326
We can bi blakclist with ease, and it will harm us

48:22.499 --> 48:25.332
That's why we're going to the biggest and richest kasinopaling in town.

48:26.370 --> 48:28.361
They do not set limits on how many bets you can install

48:30.540 --> 48:35.409
Which means ... One night one big advantage.

48:42.286 --> 48:43.446
We'll all go in separately

48:45.322 --> 48:47.313
They should not know when we are in a team.

48:53.463 --> 48:57.263
Tony, you're going to be a transportation manager.

48:57.434 --> 48:58.492
and security consultants

49:01.505 --> 49:06.238
Kevin, you deserve to be the heir to the treasure.

49:10.314 --> 49:12.282
Eric, you can be yourself

49:13.283 --> 49:15.251
Spend your dad's money- That's easy.

49:24.361 --> 49:27.489
And you ... will be my fiancee

49:29.499 --> 49:32.366
Hug me, kiss me, very convincingly

49:34.338 --> 49:36.203
You will support me even if I lose

49:39.443 --> 49:43.436
Is that why you're taking me along? - That's just a small part.

50:05.469 --> 50:07.300
You all ready?

50:37.501 --> 50:39.332
2 DAYS

51:37.461 --> 51:38.519
Tell Tony to switch the camera

51:39.396 --> 51:40.420
Tony, the camera!

51:50.474 --> 51:54.308
Okay, we need 10. Tell Eric-Eric, take out 10.

52:11.461 --> 52:13.395
Okay

52:16.466 --> 52:18.229
This must be my lucky day

52:34.351 --> 52:36.251
Eric, it's your turn!

52:39.356 --> 52:41.256
We seem to be good too, what do you think?

52:41.458 --> 52:43.323
What do you mean?

52:45.262 --> 52:47.287
You and me, we're both matchmaking

52:47.497 --> 52:49.260
What do you think?

52:50.433 --> 52:52.230
You forgot something

52:52.435 --> 52:54.266
I hear all your thoughts

52:54.371 --> 52:56.271
Look, we're like the ideal couple

52:56.540 --> 52:58.405
We can understand each other whatsoever.

53:00.510 --> 53:02.239
It will not be easy

53:02.412 --> 53:03.436
But we will find a way

53:12.322 --> 53:16.281
F, my friends. Some say if you are lucky to work, usually you are not lucky in loving |

53:18.461 --> 53:20.224
This is for you

53:20.363 --> 53:22.331
Eric, do not go anywhere We still have not won.

53:24.534 --> 53:25.523
Good luck, gentlemen

53:43.420 --> 53:45.285
Kevin, look at his eyes!

54:06.509 --> 54:07.498
Tony, the camera!

54:34.471 --> 54:36.268
Not bad!

54:57.260 --> 54:58.249
Congratulations, sir

55:11.274 --> 55:12.263
I'm back playing

55:13.276 --> 55:14.504
Let's plug it in!

55:20.483 --> 55:22.314
Very good!

55:28.491 --> 55:30.356
Yes dear!

55:32.429 --> 55:34.397
What does he do? He has to stop drinking

55:35.332 --> 55:38.233
Do not worry, Michael. Everything will be fine

55:39.302 --> 55:40.291
Just enjoy yourself

55:40.503 --> 55:42.403
Everything is habist no bet again.

55:42.505 --> 55:44.268
All right, Michael

55:51.548 --> 55:53.379
Tony, stop it! Later we are caught!

56:00.523 --> 56:03.424
I'll get the Jackpot! - Tony, no Jackpots!

56:05.495 --> 56:07.463
- 34.Yes, baby!

56:09.499 --> 56:11.490
Sir, come with me - What's wrong?

56:12.302 --> 56:13.428
What is wrong?

56:14.304 --> 56:15.464
Hey, I want to take my money!

56:17.440 --> 56:19.305
Sir, please come with me- Wait a minute!

56:20.477 --> 56:22.206
I said, please follow me!

56:52.475 --> 56:54.340
What happened?

57:00.483 --> 57:02.451
Are you guys crazy?

57:04.421 --> 57:08.414
If you want your corpse found in an underground with an outlet,

57:09.292 --> 57:10.418
just go ahead and do it

57:11.294 --> 57:14.320
And soon you will be the security officer's month

57:16.433 --> 57:18.367
But if you want to get out of here alive

57:18.501 --> 57:20.492
Rich

57:51.468 --> 57:53.436
Live, healthy, and rich

57:54.404 --> 57:55.428
Follow what I say!

57:56.406 --> 57:58.237
You understand?

58:01.411 --> 58:03.242
Meet me at the tableCrabs, in five minutes

58:29.405 --> 58:30.497
May I join?

58:42.452 --> 58:44.352
Kevin, look at his eyes!

58:48.258 --> 58:49.316
Tony, the camera

59:33.336 --> 59:34.428
This is for you

59:36.372 --> 59:37.464
Come on!

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:05.260
APa7

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:15.232
That is all?

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:23.274
I thought maybe we could do another job.

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:26.413
Something easy

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:29.450
It seems you like it

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:32.421
Then we can split up

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:37.316
There are many easy jobs waiting to be done.

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:43.364
What do you think?

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:46.267
We make a pretty good team

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:55.342
It will never end for you

01:01:56.446 --> 01:02:01.281
Besides, I do not need money

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:15.321
No need money? That is interesting

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:18.391
No one needs money, but everyone wants it.

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:24.270
Why are you still here?

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:30.208
You can go anytime want from scratch

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.510
if you do not need money

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:37.485
Because it's not like you

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:43.392
You think you're a great professional

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.293
who knew the word took risks

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:50.365
You're just a selfish gambler who's stuck in their own bad habits.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:55.268
You see yourself in a dark hole

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:58.330
play a role as a savior of yourself.

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:10.410
So now, no thanks

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:17.425
Maybe you're right

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:24.333
We should leave it like this

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:36.243
And you live in your cocoon

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:38.440
But nothing

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:42.508
Only you, your fear, your music, and nothing else

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:48.323
There was no hope

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:58.494
I want to save you You learn a lot.

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:02.231
But this is where our students have to stop.

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:09.335
You want to say I have a ball?

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:12.440
I can not let you go any further

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:15.382
Remember what I said about not taking part in this?

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:19.320
Yes. I'm working on it

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:24.254
It takes longer than I think

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:32.358
- How's he doing? - He made a lot of progress

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:37.262
Besides, she's not alone anymore. Not for long

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:40.367
He will not stay together for a long time.

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.370
Who was with him?

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.247
A professional person?

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.478
These people are involved in the same thing that we do

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:52.352
On your advice, of course

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:56.290
I hope he comes to me on his own free will

01:04:56.292 --> 01:05:00.285
But we have to play it in a different way.

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:05.390
If a person can not have his own way

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:10.405
he has to give up

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:21.374
DAY 1

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:04.384
What do you want?

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:10.296
Come on

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.411
I try to get rid of them

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:44.232
Faster!

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.387
Sorry, Michael

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:27.436
You really are a champ

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.369
You surprised me

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:34.506
I have your money. Take it

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:38.281
I've taken it

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:45.517
But these people are more valuable to me

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.504
I will never work for you

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:08.443
What can you do?

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:12.345
Maybe turn that weapon into a banana.

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:16.314
Wow, really?

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.325
Really?

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.393
Not every time it works

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.240
Come on

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:43.307
Michael, I want to let you go

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:46.252
but I'm afraid they will not

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:49.349
the situation is quite serious

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:53.256
Sorry

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:57.466
No. Wait./No!

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:05.236
Michael!

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:43.437
Bastard

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:56.307
What? You?

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:58.352
What the hell?

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:06.328
Oh, I see. Now it makes sense

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:09.388
From the beginning is you! I can not believe it!

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:10.422
Everything is you!

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.423
I have not seen you for 10 years, and you showed up,

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:15.437
and you ruined my best operation!

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:19.339
I hope you come to see me

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:23.368
For your information, others do that

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:26.347
They went to Paris with their problems

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:30.245
And they do not have a team of psychic power

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:32.243
to rob a casino

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.258
That's why you do that?

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:38.522
You should realize I'll never come for you

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:41.360
Bring me back

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:44.332
Michael, you have not talked to me for 10 years!

01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:48.463
I do not know what to do

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:52.430
OK

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:55.501
Maybe it's not the best idea, but what else can I do?

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:59.275
I have no idea. You can call

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:05.251
Somehow, I did not think about it

01:12:05.387 --> 01:12:08.254
But I saved your life, did not I?

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:10.282
No. You set me up

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.351
Same as you didribuan times before.

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:14.261
What are you talking about?

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:16.423
That is your education

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:21.458
Do you remember what happened first?

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:24.438
You accept all this very negative.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.340
Really?

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:34.382
OK. Maybe I'm a little overwhelmed

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:36.384
A little too much?

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:40.413
Michael. Michael!

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:54.496
Michael, do you remember how we dream

01:12:54.503 --> 01:12:58.439
one day find the door on the wall?

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:04.472
I remember the story. Do you remember that?

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:08.350
Why did you say this to me?

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:11.342
Because I know where to find it.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:14.447
You have 30 minutes for lunch

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:29.403
Drain

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:32.271
He needs to see something

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:39.345
Maybe he can drug at the hospital. She's getting worse

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:41.508
We should not take him to the clinic

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:46.250
We should do a lot of things differently

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:51.291
Tony?

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:03.462
Hello? / Hey, what's up?

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:06.305
The toilet was clogged

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:11.506
How can?

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:16.349
God, Michael! - I have nine lives

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:19.218
What the fuck? - Michael!

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:21.245
We're crazy. - What are you

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.258
Long story. Later

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.283
I'll get you out of here

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.455
And also the money

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:31.425
Where is Veronika?

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:38.440
He refused to work for Victor

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:42.308
He's been in a coma for a few days now.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:45.337
He goes to his subconscious

01:15:02.297 --> 01:15:05.232
Fuck it. I stopped

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.427
I also

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.329
Do whatever you want

01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:20.279
Take them downstairs. I'll be down soon

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:23.274
and handle them on their own

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:30.287
Get rid of your hand

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.386
Keep an eye on the door

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:51.507
Come on

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:06.420
Please open the door

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:36.357
Extraordinary. Now what?

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:40.387
Now you open the safe. You have 5 minutes.

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:45.456
Where is he?

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.469
Above, in the hotel, room 209

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:52.399
Good luck!

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:18.265
I can not turn them off

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.394
but I can turn some off

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:25.339
What? Are you kidding?

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.308
Ka u ta kut?

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:33.407
I hate Twister

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:49.218
OK

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:51.316
Come on in action

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:20.312
Come on. How much longer?

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:22.449
Tell me // faster. - Let's hurry

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:26.393
Tell me how much longer. - Stop talking. Let me work!

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:56.289
What the hell, Jack ?! This is us!

01:19:57.526 --> 01:20:01.326
Oh, shit./ Let's go to work!

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:09.369
Come on. Please

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:15.276
I love you, dear

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.207
Perfect

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:51.405
What next?

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.472
That is all

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.384
APa7

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:02.288
APa7

01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:06.293
What do you mean, that's it?

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:08.489
We are confined in steel tombs

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:11.260
with a bunch of armed guards outside,

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:13.460
and you're gonna tell me you're over here?

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:16.403
This is a place in the entire casino

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:19.373
They can not catch us in here.

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:23.436
And now I have to pick up Veronika.

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:28.373
Shit! He tricked us

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:30.351
The game is over

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:32.376
I need you guys to help pick up Veronika,

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:34.321
wherever he is

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:42.396
You're normal. You're not like us

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:46.232
Continue?

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:48.259
We all have space

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:51.362
That's how I can pick her up, is not she?

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.500
Even though you got there

01:21:54.509 --> 01:21:56.477
not sure you will get the ability

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:58.506
I do not need them

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:02.279
You're not ready for this

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:04.410
You will die

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:06.478
No one knows that for sure

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:11.519
But that was the only chance I had

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:14.393
that you have

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:18.491
All we have

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:27.366
I need you to help pick up Veronika.

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:32.310
- I do not know how. - Kevin, listen to me.

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:34.373
Get me into my subconscious

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:45.484
Let him try

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.399
Okay

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:14.286
When they come out, kill them all

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:39.433
Mom, why do you always have to go?

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:41.466
When you go home?

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:47.438
Nothing. Just you, your fear

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:50.247
your music, and nothing else

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:52.378
There was no hope

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:56.357
Raise your hands! You're under arrest!

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:58.484
Put your hand where I can see it.

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:06.266
You're just a selfish gambler who's stuck in their own bad habits.

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:13.367
Guilty. You were sentenced to six months in a juvenile prison.

01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:19.316
Veronika. Where are you?

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:12.431
Veronika

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:16.306
Veronika, we have to go

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.448
What are you doing?

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:26.445
Veronika, can you hear me?

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:28.455
What are you doing, Veronika?

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:33.256
We have to go. Listen to me

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.422
We have no time. We must go!

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.468
Veronika!

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:43.359
Shit!

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:59.515
You can not hear me

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:12.399
I know how to hear me.

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:49.233
Veronika

01:31:57.345 --> 01:32:02.248
Veronika, we have to go. Now

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:06.479
Can you feel that?

01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:09.388
What are you talking about?

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:15.395
I do not know I can feel a world like this

01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:18.262
Veronika, listen to meThe feeling is not real

01:32:18.299 --> 01:32:20.267
You must come with me

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:24.396
Michael, you're dead

01:32:25.273 --> 01:32:28.470
I'm real, and I'm alive. - Calm down

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:31.370
Stay with me

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:33.403
Veronika, listen to me. You have to believe me

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:37.408
I do not have much time

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:45.323
How about this?

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:30.265
I do not go

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:32.431
I do not have anything there

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.307
I do not go without you

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:41.471
Besides you, I do not have anything there

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:47.344
Trust me

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:51.481
Why did you do it?

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:14.246
APa7

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:20.387
You're risking your life for me

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:25.257
You know, in every human life

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:37.293
there are certain limits

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:40.239
you can not get past.

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:42.408
What is it because rasatakutut, or just because

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:45.310
he could not believe it was possible

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.507
Then I met you

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:51.476
And here I am

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:54.511
Beyond all the limits in my mind,

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:56.490
and all I can believe

01:34:56.490 --> 01:35:01.427
I think to be with you forever, but that's impossible

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:13.473
It's the door. Let's go

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:19.474
For me the way it works is not like that. / What?

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:22.380
Why? - I have to find my own way out.

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:24.281
I'll come with you. - No

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:28.221
If you do not go now all this will be in vain.

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:32.483
When you wake up, I'll be there

01:35:32.493 --> 01:35:35.291
waiting for you

01:35:35.329 --> 01:35:39.356
You said you'd believe me, right? Yes, right?

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:24.275
Michael

01:36:25.379 --> 01:36:27.313
Michael

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:39.292
These doors, each of them are

01:36:39.326 --> 01:36:41.385
entrance to someone's house

01:36:41.395 --> 01:36:46.332
someone's apartment. There are a lot of people who live there.

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:52.295
Some of them are very good, others are not so good.

01:36:52.439 --> 01:36:56.466
You go in and give them a suitcase full of money

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:58.411
their lives will change

01:36:58.445 --> 01:37:01.312
If you go in and take their savings

01:37:01.315 --> 01:37:03.283
their lives will also change

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:05.309
But in a different way

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:09.320
I know. But these doors

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:12.452
They are closed to us We are ordinary people.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:15.360
Each apartment has one door.

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:18.422
Everyone should live in his chance.

01:37:19.366 --> 01:37:25.430
Michael, it will have all the knowledge

01:37:25.472 --> 01:37:28.407
and the secrets of humanity

01:37:28.442 --> 01:37:35.371
Everything that ever existed in everyone's mind, dead or alive

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:40.285
Now, can you imagine the possibilities?

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:43.482
We can learn anything we want.

01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:46.323
We can get whatever we want

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:53.391
Please do not tell me how to think about a new business.

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:58.394
The business is our life. - Damn it

01:37:58.405 --> 01:38:01.465
Are not we too old for this?

01:38:01.508 --> 01:38:03.339
Maybe

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:07.474
And, there is one problem

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:14.287
Even all the great people who have been there have failed to return

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:21.453
8 minutes is how long you can survive there alone.

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:26.457
Then you start to forget your own existence.

01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:29.459
In the end, your mind is gone

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:32.336
united with billions of previous thoughts.

01:38:32.339 --> 01:38:38.209
You'll never get back to your senses

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:41.339
if someone does not remind you who you are

01:38:41.382 --> 01:38:45.375
So, I need a partner

01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:48.386
So you brought me here

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:51.256
just because you need me again

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:55.490
You always want to know what's behind a white door, do not you?

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:58.327
I thought about it, then I realized

01:38:58.332 --> 01:39:02.393
the only person I can trust is you

01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:05.267
You do not understand, huh?

01:39:05.306 --> 01:39:09.367
Because of you, I involve some good people into trouble.

01:39:11.378 --> 01:39:18.284
I still feel uncomfortable with the problem I caused

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:25.484
I want to help you, as your father

01:39:27.294 --> 01:39:33.255
Now, there is one man. You know him

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.461
But this time, she will be on your side

01:39:35.502 --> 01:39:39.438
And you have to share it with him. Take it.

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:42.502
This will be your compass

01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:47.303
I think this is something you need for the rest of your life.

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:53.410
All my life I need a father, but yes,

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:55.479
this is also good. thank you

01:39:56.357 --> 01:40:01.454
By the way, do not forget about my part.

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:05.322
This does not mean I'm going to be your partner

01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:08.367
I am just kidding

01:40:08.402 --> 01:40:10.495
No. I'm not kidding

01:40:11.438 --> 01:40:15.465
I am just kidding. You're a good boy

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:23.241
Now you know who you are and what you can do.

01:41:24.344 --> 01:41:28.212
We are in your memory. I pull you out.

01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:29.374
Now finish yourself

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:31.407
How can I save them?

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:33.352
Look into it

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:35.480
and try to capture the essence

01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:43.488
Sometimes there is more truth in the illusion,

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.395
than in reality

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.469
The key to the problem apapundi in one's mind

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:52.370
is stepping the right kind of downright.

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:54.501
No, no!

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:56.373
Wait!

01:41:58.445 --> 01:41:59.412
No!

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:18.329
Sorry, I'm stuck

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:25.235
Michael./Michael

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:31.274
Take the money. We're leaving.

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:32.369
You lie to me again

01:42:32.479 --> 01:42:35.346
Believe me, it will not happen again

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:39.251
Tony

01:42:41.255 --> 01:42:43.280
Michael, are you crazy?

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:46.459
They will kill us

01:42:49.463 --> 01:42:52.227
You gonna believe me?

01:43:36.276 --> 01:43:39.336
Fraud is also a game

01:43:42.516 --> 01:43:47.249
And the better you know your opponent

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:50.517
... the more money you can win

01:43:52.259 --> 01:43:54.352
But let me tell you

01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:57.330
ni?

01:43:57.331 --> 01:44:00.459
This is only part of my plan

01:44:02.502 --> 01:44:06.438
But the greatest art is to control your enemies

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:14.412
And the key to your victory is in his head.

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:22.286
What are the major weaknesses of the subconscious

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:25.348
like a bulletproof safe?

01:44:27.361 --> 01:44:29.226
That is why

01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:32.423
He's afraid of losing everything

01:44:42.242 --> 01:44:44.233
And this?

01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:48.237
This is the end of my plan

01:45:09.369 --> 01:45:12.497
They descend from the other side. Everything is out, now

01:45:12.539 --> 01:45:14.302
They escaped

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:15.434
All!

01:45:51.345 --> 01:45:53.370
This is yours

01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:59.319
Good work, everybody

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:02.480
I think your talent should be better utilized

01:46:02.489 --> 01:46:05.322
rather than robbing the casino

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:09.319
I have a suggestion for all of you

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:23.309
3 MONTHS LATER

01:46:35.255 --> 01:46:37.382
Do it. I paid 5 million for that

01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:39.416
Wait. That's mine. - No. I hired you

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:40.426
No

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:43.429
Are you ready for the greatest robbery in the history of mankind?

01:46:43.463 --> 01:46:45.522
Just one job then we split up.

01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:48.433
That's what your mother told me first
