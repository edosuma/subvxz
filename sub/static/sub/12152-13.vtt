15:38.773 --> 15:41.890
You couldn't save me from me.

15:43.853 --> 15:45.172
Is that what you thought?

15:45.373 --> 15:48.285
Me. Lover, I'm not even here.

15:48.453 --> 15:52.526
I'm just a figment in your
devilishly handsome head.

15:52.693 --> 15:55.890
So clearly, it's what you thought.

15:57.413 --> 16:02.441
For all your supposed darkness,
edge-of-the-razor mystique...

16:02.613 --> 16:04.763
...there was always
a small part of you...

16:04.933 --> 16:09.723
...that thought you could pull me back
from the brink of my evil, evil ways.

16:09.893 --> 16:12.566
Help me find redemption.

16:12.733 --> 16:14.724
Redemption.

16:14.893 --> 16:17.202
Angel's influence, I suppose.

16:17.373 --> 16:22.766
The whole "not giving up on someone
no matter how far he or she has fallen."

16:22.933 --> 16:25.891
Oh, well. Too late for me.

16:30.733 --> 16:32.371
So let's just get it over with.

16:32.573 --> 16:35.007
That body's not gonna
dismember itself, you know.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.011
I'm sorry, Lilah.

16:38.173 --> 16:42.564
No, Wes, we don't have that word
in our vocabulary.

16:42.733 --> 16:44.132
Not people like you and...

16:58.493 --> 16:59.812
[WHISTLING]

17:01.373 --> 17:02.692
[LAUGHS]

17:03.933 --> 17:07.005
This how you treat an old friend?

17:07.173 --> 17:10.449
Kill the chick I was chasing...

17:10.613 --> 17:14.685
...then lure me here
with the scent of her blood.

17:16.973 --> 17:20.443
We were never friends, Angelus.

17:20.813 --> 17:22.246
I know.

17:22.413 --> 17:27.646
But calling you a "big, dumb hunk
of rock" seemed a little on the nose.

17:27.853 --> 17:30.765
Come on, man, I'm teasing.

17:31.053 --> 17:34.329
It's been, what, couple hundred years?
You still want to kick my ass?

17:34.493 --> 17:39.009
It's true, I long to crush your skull,
but I didn't bring you here to fight.

17:39.213 --> 17:42.285
- That wasn't my instruction.
- Your instruction.

17:42.493 --> 17:44.609
My master has requested you.

17:45.213 --> 17:46.566
Your master.

17:47.013 --> 17:50.528
Nice workmanship.
Did you make this in shop for Daddy?

17:50.733 --> 17:52.644
Don't touch that.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.685
Sorry. I can see you put
a lot of yourself into it.

17:57.813 --> 18:03.410
So, the attack on Angel Investigations,
rain of fire, blotting out the sun...

18:03.613 --> 18:06.525
Stealing your soul.
All designed by my master...

18:06.693 --> 18:09.002
...to bring forth and keep Angelus.

18:09.853 --> 18:13.448
Well, hell of a plan.
Real big-picture thinking.

18:13.613 --> 18:16.810
So when can I meet the big brain
behind my liberation?

18:17.013 --> 18:21.086
In time. For now, you will take
your orders through me.

18:21.733 --> 18:24.770
Or here's a better idea.
No, I won't.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.528
Tell your boss I'm grateful
for the attention...

18:27.693 --> 18:30.287
...but I don't take grocery lists
from the messenger boy.

18:30.493 --> 18:32.211
I will teach you respect.

18:32.413 --> 18:36.042
Look, you may have played
those suckers at Angel, Inc...

18:36.253 --> 18:38.323
...but I don't like
having my strings yanked.

18:38.493 --> 18:42.611
And I don't like
being kept in the dark.

18:43.573 --> 18:45.609
Figuratively, anyway.

18:45.813 --> 18:49.283
And if your boss was half as smart
as he thinks he is...

18:49.493 --> 18:51.723
...he knows I won't take orders
from a lackey.

18:53.693 --> 18:57.129
What, you don't like "lackey"?

18:57.293 --> 18:59.523
Well, how about "toady"?

19:01.053 --> 19:03.328
Or "lickspittle."
Come on, lickspittle's nice.

19:03.773 --> 19:06.446
Oh, wait, I got it.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.888
"Flunky." That's it.

19:09.053 --> 19:12.329
You're just a big, stupid, butt-ugly...

19:13.613 --> 19:15.205
...slow-moving flunky.

19:17.213 --> 19:21.331
Rocky, if that's all you got, you better
throw in the towel and call it a night.

19:23.613 --> 19:26.764
When the Beastmaster's ready
to peek out from behind your skirt...

19:26.933 --> 19:28.969
...have him give me a call.

19:33.173 --> 19:36.529
Well, you handled that brilliantly.

19:36.693 --> 19:39.890
He's not to be trusted.

19:40.093 --> 19:41.651
What about you?

19:41.853 --> 19:44.686
Letting him bait you
into a fight like that.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.487
I haven't spent all this
time and energy...

19:47.653 --> 19:52.010
...so you can mess it all up
with your petty jealousies.

19:52.173 --> 19:55.722
You know Angelus
is crucial to my plan.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.686
My apologies, my master.

19:59.053 --> 20:00.964
You need patience.

20:01.173 --> 20:05.132
He'll come around when he sees
what I have to offer.

20:05.293 --> 20:10.208
And if he doesn't, you can pull
off his head and tear him to bits.

20:13.173 --> 20:15.004

a sanctuary now."

That it?

20:42.893 --> 20:45.566
Well, if we followed the recipe...

20:46.573 --> 20:47.892
...should be cake.

20:48.453 --> 20:50.523
A demon-violence-free-zone cake.

I don't know, Lorne,
doesn't feel like anything's different.

20:53.933 --> 20:55.491
Because it's not.

20:55.653 --> 20:58.690
Like every other lame spell
you people try, it didn't work.

20:58.853 --> 21:01.765
It never works. I pretty much
concluded that magic sucks.

- Sanctuary spell's working?
- Yeah, like a charm. Literally.

21:16.653 --> 21:19.963
- Good. It'll make this easier.
- Make what easier?

21:20.173 --> 21:24.291
- Where's Cordelia?
- Upstairs asleep. She still feels weak.

Make what easier?

21:26.413 --> 21:29.052
- We're gonna bring Angelus in alive.
- No, we're not.

21:29.213 --> 21:31.408
Thought you said capturing him
wasn't an option.

21:31.613 --> 21:33.490
- Changed my mind.
- Change it back.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.570
We get rid of Angelus, then what?

21:35.733 --> 21:38.042
We still have a Beast
we don't know how to kill.

21:38.253 --> 21:41.882
We know it's working for something
much worse, but we don't know what.

21:42.093 --> 21:44.084
We're caught in the middle
of a maelstrom...

21:44.253 --> 21:46.926
...and we can't get out
without our champion.

21:49.253 --> 21:51.687
We're gonna save Angel.

21:52.533 --> 21:55.843
And I know who we need
to help us do it.

was here to see me.

- Still alive.

in the blanks for me. Why?

decades when my parole comes up.

- You thought it was Angelus.

30:26.293 --> 30:29.365
Can't listen, you're no good to me.
Someone take him back to the hotel.

30:29.533 --> 30:30.522
What?

30:30.693 --> 30:33.366
The kid's got a history
of not doing what he's told.

30:33.573 --> 30:35.803
- He'll do what I tell him.
- Yeah, sure I will.

30:36.333 --> 30:38.324
[GRUNTING]

30:41.493 --> 30:43.882
I get it, you're a super-being.

30:52.493 --> 30:55.132
Are you a murderer? Because I am.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.164
And if it comes down
to you or Angelus...

30:59.333 --> 31:02.803
...you haven't shown me a thing
to make me want to take your side.

31:17.933 --> 31:20.128
I like her.

31:22.013 --> 31:24.163
Come on.

31:27.213 --> 31:31.001
- Do you know where we're going?
- Not especially.

31:31.173 --> 31:33.926
How do you expect to find Angelus
without Connor?

31:34.093 --> 31:37.244
The old-fashioned way.
The kid's not the only tracker.

31:37.413 --> 31:39.165
Something will turn up.

31:39.333 --> 31:42.052
A trail of bodies. A telltale clue.

31:46.613 --> 31:49.173
Maybe a carpet fiber.

31:51.013 --> 31:54.050
So much for the element of surprise.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.044
We'll have to come at him
from two sides.

31:56.213 --> 31:58.408
You take low.

31:59.493 --> 32:01.290
I'll hit him high.

32:04.133 --> 32:05.452
[GRUNTS]

32:05.773 --> 32:09.322
Pretty ballsy, mister.
Creeping around my buddy Angelus.

32:09.533 --> 32:12.127
Come on, pretty boy.

32:14.853 --> 32:16.286
Our buddy.

32:23.813 --> 32:27.852
ANGELUS:
Hey, Faith, nice to see you again.

32:28.013 --> 32:30.049
You're looking choice as ever.

32:30.213 --> 32:34.729
Oh, that's right.
We've never really met, have we?

32:34.893 --> 32:36.690
So, what are you waiting for?

32:36.853 --> 32:38.923
Come out and give me a kiss.

32:39.093 --> 32:41.368
No, no, no.

32:42.813 --> 32:45.122
You come to me.

32:50.013 --> 32:51.924
That's it.

33:00.373 --> 33:01.692
Getting warmer.

33:19.933 --> 33:22.493
Warmer.

33:22.653 --> 33:24.644
Warmer.

33:28.453 --> 33:30.887
You're smoking hot.

33:32.653 --> 33:36.123
But then again,
you probably knew that.

33:36.933 --> 33:40.721
Honey, I brought a guest home
for dinner.

33:44.573 --> 33:45.892
[LAUGHING]

33:46.893 --> 33:48.485
Let's eat.

33:55.893 --> 34:00.250
- What is this, Angelus?
- This is a slayer.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.449
Say hi to the nice Beast, Faith.

34:02.613 --> 34:04.763
You dare to bring a slayer here?

34:04.973 --> 34:08.409
Hey, I'm doing you a favor,
Stonehenge.

34:08.612 --> 34:11.810
She's here to seriously mess up
you and your boss's plans.

34:12.013 --> 34:16.563
So the question is:
What do you do, hotshot?

34:17.652 --> 34:18.641
What do you do?

34:25.453 --> 34:27.887
Smile, Faith.
Thought you'd enjoy a threesome.

34:28.053 --> 34:29.565
Sure.

34:32.213 --> 34:33.965
Let's get it on.

34:40.373 --> 34:41.692
Oo-wee!

34:41.893 --> 34:44.009
Watch yourself, big guy. Girl's on fire.

34:52.652 --> 34:53.641
Ooh.

34:53.853 --> 34:55.764
That's gonna sting in the morning.

35:08.533 --> 35:09.761
Nice.

35:35.613 --> 35:37.410
[GRUNTING]

35:50.413 --> 35:52.563
ANGELUS: Come on, Faithy.
You're not even trying.

35:59.573 --> 36:00.972
Better get up.

36:09.213 --> 36:11.602
You know,
somebody should break this up.

36:29.173 --> 36:32.131
This is all you are?

36:35.933 --> 36:39.528
I had heard the slayer
possessed great strength.

36:40.333 --> 36:42.893
But there's no real power here.

36:43.293 --> 36:45.807
My master's power is beyond all limits.

36:45.973 --> 36:49.932
Beyond your petty imagining.

36:52.973 --> 36:54.201
You are weak.

36:56.933 --> 36:58.685
You're nothing.

36:58.893 --> 37:01.282
You could not even defeat me.

37:01.493 --> 37:03.484
Ain't that the truth.

37:03.653 --> 37:06.008
I mean, look at this guy.

37:06.733 --> 37:11.682
Pretty much the only thing that could
do damage to that thick, stony hide...

37:11.853 --> 37:13.571
...is himself.

37:13.733 --> 37:18.170
Or maybe, I don't know,
maybe a piece of himself.

37:18.733 --> 37:19.802
[ROARS]

37:31.853 --> 37:34.048
I knew it. I knew it!

37:53.253 --> 37:55.244
[YELLING]

37:56.093 --> 37:58.049
Faith.

38:09.093 --> 38:10.890
Oh, crap.

38:11.053 --> 38:13.692
You mean killing The Beast
really does bring back the sun?

38:13.853 --> 38:16.083
I thought that was Angel's
retarded fantasy.

38:16.533 --> 38:17.852
[GROANING]

38:18.053 --> 38:19.611
Oh, well, what are you gonna do?

38:19.773 --> 38:21.843
Take the bad with the good,
I always say.

38:22.053 --> 38:25.090
Anyhow, I just wanted Beastie Boy here
to soften you up.

38:25.293 --> 38:27.966
I like my meat nice and tender.

38:29.973 --> 38:31.292
[GRUNTS]

38:31.493 --> 38:32.482
Ooh!

38:32.653 --> 38:35.804
A swing and a miss, slugger.
Sorry, but...

38:42.893 --> 38:44.246
God.

38:44.413 --> 38:45.732
[LAUGHING]

38:46.013 --> 38:49.289
Okay. Well, I gotta give you props.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.449
Nice move, really.

38:51.653 --> 38:56.010
We'll just have to take a rain check
on that whole "eviscerating you" thing.

38:59.933 --> 39:02.686
Just you and me now, Faithy.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.249
Catch you later.

39:22.653 --> 39:25.087
Check it out. We got sun.

39:25.253 --> 39:26.971
Well, ding-dong, The Beast is dead.

39:27.133 --> 39:31.251
I've never seen anything
so beautiful in all my life.

39:31.413 --> 39:32.812
Where are the others?

39:32.973 --> 39:36.090
Yeah, let's hear the war stories.
How'd you bring that monster down?

39:36.253 --> 39:37.891
It wasn't us, not Connor and me.

39:38.053 --> 39:40.362
She must've fought it. Faith.

39:40.533 --> 39:42.683
Beast must've attacked her,
and she must...

39:42.853 --> 39:44.411
It's gotta be.

39:44.573 --> 39:48.327
- Hey, where's Cordy? Does she know?
- She's up in her room.

39:50.293 --> 39:51.772
Hey, what about Angelus?

39:51.973 --> 39:53.725
If that girl can take out The Beast...

39:53.893 --> 39:57.522
...my money says she'll have Angelus
hog-tied and back here by dinnertime.

40:00.853 --> 40:04.243
Hey, isn't it incredible?

40:06.213 --> 40:09.364
It's wonderful.

40:09.533 --> 40:12.047
She did it. Faith.

40:12.213 --> 40:14.204
She's...

40:17.053 --> 40:18.042
...amazing.

40:18.813 --> 40:21.532
- Connor...
- I had no idea what a slayer could do.

40:22.373 --> 40:25.843
A weakness for slayers.
You're definitely his son.

40:27.213 --> 40:29.169
Connor...

40:32.173 --> 40:36.451
...we need...
There's something you need to...

40:39.693 --> 40:41.604
I don't know how...

40:41.773 --> 40:44.287
Well, I know how, but...

40:44.493 --> 40:46.324
What?

40:46.933 --> 40:48.764
What is it?

40:50.453 --> 40:52.409
We're having a baby.

41:01.333 --> 41:03.563
Touch it.

41:09.173 --> 41:10.162
This...

41:13.493 --> 41:15.802
It's impossible. How could...?

41:16.013 --> 41:22.202
All I know is, there's a life growing
inside of me, and it's ours.

41:23.413 --> 41:25.563
We're connected now.

41:34.893 --> 41:38.169
You and me...

41:38.733 --> 41:40.883
...forever.
