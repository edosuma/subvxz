03:08.772 --> 03:10.399
Kathy?

03:10.482 --> 03:13.281
Listen, your life
could depend on this.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.661
Don '1' blink. Don't even blink.
Blink and you're dead.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.001
They are fast.
Faster than you can believe.

03:21.118 --> 03:25.669
Don't turn your back,
don't look away and don't blink.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.883
Good luck.

03:50.814 --> 03:51.940
Hello?

03:52.023 --> 03:55.118
Bit freaked. Need to talk.
Making you a coffee.

03:55.193 --> 03:58.322
Sally Sparrow, it's 7:00 in the morning.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.870
Do you think I'm going out
at 7:00 in the morning?

04:00.991 --> 04:02.163
No.

04:02.284 --> 04:06.209
I'm in the kitchen. What's that
on all those screens in your front room?

04:06.329 --> 04:07.672
Oh, God.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.757
Oh, God. Sally, you've met
my brother Larry, haven't you?

04:12.836 --> 04:14.429
- No.
- You're about to.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.599
Okay.

04:18.675 --> 04:24.182
Not sure, but really, really hoping...

04:25.849 --> 04:28.147
- Pants?
- No.

04:31.855 --> 04:36.235
Put them on! Put them on! I hate you!

04:36.818 --> 04:39.071
What are you thinking?

04:40.697 --> 04:44.292
Sorry. My useless brother.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.505
Sally? What's wrong?

04:50.373 --> 04:52.046
What's happened?

04:55.962 --> 05:01.890
Okay. Let's investigate.
You and me, girl investigators.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.810
Love it. Hey! Sparrow and Nightingale.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.233
- That so works.
- Bi'Â£ ITV.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.273
I know!

05:13.688 --> 05:16.157
What did you come here for anyway?

05:17.317 --> 05:20.321
I love old things.
They make me feel sad.

05:21.738 --> 05:27.791
- What's good about sad?
- It's happy for deep people.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.680
The weeping angel.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.810
Wouldn't have that in my garden.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.777
- It's moved.
- It's what?

05:52.269 --> 05:56.399
Since yesterday.
I'm sure of it. It's closer.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.159
It's got closer to the house.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.334
How can my name be written here?

06:14.165 --> 06:16.088
How is that possible?

06:20.338 --> 06:22.261
Who'd come here?

06:23.842 --> 06:25.719
- What are you doing?
- It could be a burglar.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.930
A burglar who rings the doorbell?

06:29.389 --> 06:33.314
- Okay. I'll stay here in case of...
- In case of?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.154
- Incidents?
- Okay.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.541
I'm looking for Sally Sparrow.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.465
How did you know I'd be here?

06:55.540 --> 07:01.798
I was told to bring this letter
on this date at this exact time

07:01.880 --> 07:03.678
to Sally Sparrow.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.761
- Looks old.
- It is old.

07:08.345 --> 07:11.349
I'm sorry, do you have anything
with a photograph on it,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.354
like a driving license?

07:16.728 --> 07:19.447
No one knew I was coming here.
I didn't tell anyone.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.115
How could anyone have known?

07:21.191 --> 07:25.697
It's all a bit complicated.
I'm not sure I understand it myself.

07:36.915 --> 07:42.888
Yes. Sorry, I feel really stupid.
I was told to make absolutely sure.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.632
It's so hard to tell
with these little photographs, isn't it?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.183
Apparently.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.813
Well, here goes, I suppose.

07:56.768 --> 08:00.238
- Funny feeling after all these years.
- Who's it from?

08:00.313 --> 08:04.568
- Well, that's a long story, actually.
- Give me a name.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.492
Katherine Wainwright.

08:08.571 --> 08:12.246
But she specified I should tell you
that, prior to marriage,

08:12.701 --> 08:16.171
she was called Kathy Nightingale.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.170
Kathy?

08:21.209 --> 08:23.632
Kathy. Yes.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.849
Katherine Costello Nightingale.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.473
- Is this a joke?
- Joke?

08:31.803 --> 08:34.056
Kathy, is this you?

08:34.139 --> 08:37.268
Very funny. Kathy?

08:48.945 --> 08:52.199
- Kathy? Kathy?
- Please.

08:52.824 --> 08:56.328
You need to take this. I promised.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.464
Excuse me. Where am I?

09:03.543 --> 09:07.138
I was in London.
I was in the middle of London.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.012
- You're in Hull.
- No, I'm not.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.681
- This is Hull.
- No, it isn't.

09:12.844 --> 09:16.894
- You're in Hull.
- I'm not in Hull. Stop saying Hull.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.235
Who are you? Why are you here?

09:20.310 --> 09:22.859
- I made a promise.
- Who to?

09:22.979 --> 09:26.483
My grandmother.
Katherine Costello Nightingale.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.534
Don't have that in London.
There's no call for it. It's all Hull.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.541
1920?

09:38.536 --> 09:40.413
- Your grandmother?
- Yes.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.591
She died 20 years ago.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.216
Huh.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.559
- So they're related?
- Sorry?

09:53.635 --> 09:56.639
My Kathy, your grandmother.
They're practically identical.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.567
Where you going?

10:05.021 --> 10:07.820
My dearest Sally Sparrow,

10:07.899 --> 10:10.402
if my grandson has done
as he promises he will,

10:10.485 --> 10:12.078
then as you read these ward;

10:12.153 --> 10:15.123
it has been mere minutes
since we last spoke.

10:15.198 --> 10:19.499
For you. For me,
it has been over 60 years.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.381
The third of the photographs
is of my children.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.962
The youngest is Sally.
I named her after you, of course.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.387
This is sick.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.892
This is totally sick.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.274
Kathy? Kathy!

10:42.976 --> 10:44.353
Kathy?

11:50.627 --> 11:52.880
No, wait. Hang on!

12:25.328 --> 12:29.834
I suppose, unless I live
to a really exceptional old age,

12:29.916 --> 12:33.011
I will be long gone as you read this.

12:33.336 --> 12:37.807
Don '2' feel sorry for me.
I have lea' a good and full life.

12:38.132 --> 12:42.228
I've loved a good man
and been well loved in return.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.932
You would have liked Ben.

12:46.015 --> 12:49.690
He was the very first person I met
in 1.920.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.864
- Are you following me?
- Yeah.

12:54.190 --> 12:58.616
- Are you going to stop following me?
- No, I don't think so.

13:01.322 --> 13:05.623
To take one breath in 2007
and the next in 7920

13:05.702 --> 13:08.626
is a strange way to start a new life,

13:08.705 --> 13:12.335
but a new life
is exactly what I've always wanted.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.381
1902.

13:16.421 --> 13:19.675
You told him you were 18, you lying cow.

13:21.259 --> 13:26.311
My mum and dad are gone by your time,
so really there's only Lawrence to tell.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.814
He works at the DVD store
on Queen Street.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.395
I don't know
what you're gonna say to him,

13:32.520 --> 13:35.069
but I know you'll think of something.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.906
Just tell him I love him.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.589
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Lawrence Nightingale.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.715
In the back.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.402
Hello?

14:17.440 --> 14:19.943
- Martha!
- Sorry.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.989
Quite possibly.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.367
Afraid so.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.121
Oh. Hello.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.005
- Can I help you?
- Hi.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.624
38.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.551
Just a moment.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.557
Hang on. We've met, haven't we?

14:47.178 --> 14:48.976
It'll come to you.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.517
- Oh, my God.
- There it is.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.486
Sorry. Sorry, again, about the whole...

14:55.603 --> 14:59.153
- Message from your sister.
- Oh, okay.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.658
What? What is it? What's the message?

15:05.196 --> 15:07.915
- She's had to go away for a bit.
- Where?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.459
Just a work thing.
Nothing to worry about.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.334
- Okay.
- And...

15:14.288 --> 15:17.167
- And... And what?
- She loves you.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.089
She what?

15:19.168 --> 15:22.138
She said to say...
She just sort of mentioned it.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.841
She loves you.
There, that's nice, isn't it?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.302
- Is she ill?
- No! No.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.514
- Am I ill?
- No.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.525
- Is this a trick?
- No. She loves you.

15:34.892 --> 15:39.238
People don't understand time.
It's not what you think it is.

15:39.897 --> 15:43.151
- Who is this guy?
- Sorry, the pause thing keeps slipping.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.202
- Stupid thing.
- Last night at Kathy's,

15:45.278 --> 15:47.497
you had him on all those screens,
that same guy.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.246
Talking about, I don't know,
blinking or something.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.118
Yeah, the bit
about the blinking's great.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.120
I was just checking to see
if they were all the same.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.796
What were the same?

15:55.872 --> 15:58.716
- What is this? Who is he?
- An Easter egg.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.299
- Excuse me?
- Like a DVD extra, yeah?

16:02.378 --> 16:05.632
You know how on DVDs they put extras,
you know, documentaries and stuff?

16:05.715 --> 16:08.889
Sometimes they put on hidden ones
and they call them Easter eggs.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.637
You have to go looking for them,

16:10.720 --> 16:12.768
follow a bunch of clues
on the menu screen.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.474
Complicated

16:14.557 --> 16:16.104
Sorry.

16:16.642 --> 16:21.148
It's interesting, actually.
He is on 17 different DVDs.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.780
There are 17 totally unrelated DVDs
all with him on,

16:24.901 --> 16:28.280
always hidden away, always a secret.
Not even the publishers know.

16:28.362 --> 16:32.663
I've talked to the manufacturers, right?
They don't even know.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.120
He's like... He's a ghost DVD extra.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.871
Just shows up
where he's not supposed to be.

16:36.954 --> 16:41.084
- But only on those. Those 17.
- Well, what does he do?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.469
Just sits there, making random remarks.

16:43.586 --> 16:46.055
It's like we're hearing
half a conversation.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.509
Me and the guys are always trying
to work out the other half.

16:49.592 --> 16:53.142
When you say you and the guys,
you mean the internet, don't you?

16:53.930 --> 16:56.274
- How'd you know?
- Spooky, isn't it?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.819
Very complicated

16:59.936 --> 17:03.440
- Lawrence, need you.
- Excuse me a sec.

17:05.358 --> 17:09.032
People assume that time is
a strict progression of cause to effect

17:09.111 --> 17:12.205
but actually, from a non-linear,
non-subjective viewpoint,

17:12.281 --> 17:17.708
it's more like a big ball
of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.955
It started well, that sentence.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.459
It got away from me, yeah.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.511
Okay, that was weird.
Like you can hear me.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.096
Well, I can hear you.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.844
Okay, that's enough.

17:28.965 --> 17:32.845
I've had enough now. I've had a long day
and I've had bloody enough.

17:32.969 --> 17:36.143
Sorry, bad day.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.731
- Got you the list.
- What?

17:40.977 --> 17:44.322
The 17 DVDs.
I thought you might be interested.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.818
Yeah. Great. Thanks.

17:50.111 --> 17:53.081
Go to the police, you stupid woman.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.125
Why does nobody ever just go
to the police?

18:07.545 --> 18:09.923
Look, I know how mad I'm sounding.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.054
Shall we try it from the beginning
this time?

18:12.174 --> 18:15.474
Okay, there's this house,
a big, old house, been empty for years,

18:15.553 --> 18:18.352
falling apart, Wester Drumlins,
out by the estate.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.183
You've probably seen it.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.110
- Wester Drumlins?
- Yes.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.859
- Could you just wait here for a minute?
- Oh.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.273
Okay. Cracking up now.

19:02.558 --> 19:06.483
Hi. DI Billy Shipton.
Wester Drumlins, that's mine.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.860
Can't talk to you now,
got a thing I can't be late for,

19:08.939 --> 19:10.907
so if you could just...

19:12.401 --> 19:15.029
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:16.405 --> 19:21.081
Er, Marcie, can you tell them
I'm going to be late for that thing?

19:26.207 --> 19:29.552
- All of them?
- Over the last two years, yeah.

19:29.627 --> 19:31.721
They all still have personal items
in them

19:31.796 --> 19:34.390
and a couple still had
the motor running.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.092
So over the last two years,

19:36.175 --> 19:38.394
the owners of all of these vehicles
have driven up

19:38.469 --> 19:43.066
to Wester Drumlins house,
parked outside and just disappeared?

19:46.268 --> 19:48.896
- What's that?
- Ah.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.607
The pride of
the Wester Drumlins collection.

19:51.691 --> 19:55.946
We found that there, too.
Somebody's idea of a joke, I suppose.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.447
But what is it? What's a police box?

19:58.572 --> 20:01.200
Well, it's a special kind of phone box
for policemen.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.332
They used to have them all over,
but this isn't a real one.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.673
The phone is just a dummy
and the windows are the wrong size.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.383
Can't even get in it.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.211
Ordinary Yale lock, but nothing fits.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.131
But that's not the big question.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.514
See, you're missing the big question.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.187
Okay, what's the big question?

20:21.262 --> 20:24.983
- Will you have a drink with me?
- I'm sorry?

20:25.433 --> 20:28.312
Drink? You, me, now?

20:28.602 --> 20:32.152
Aren't you on duty,
Detective Inspector Shipton?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.609
Nope. Knocked off before I left.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.362
- Told them I had a family crisis.
- Why?

20:37.445 --> 20:40.699
Because life is short
and you are hot. Drink?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.787
No.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.040
- Ever?
- Maybe.

20:45.453 --> 20:48.252
- Phone number?
- Moving rather fast, DI Shipton.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.630
- Billy. I'm off duty.
- Aren't you just?

20:53.961 --> 20:56.555
- Is that your phone number?
- Just my phone number.

20:56.714 --> 21:02.847
Not a promise, not a guarantee,
not an IOU, just a phone number.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.307
- And that's Sally...
- Sally Shipton.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.767
Sparrow! Sally Sparrow.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.737
- Ah.
- Okay, going now. Don't look at me.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.280
- I'll phone you.
- Don't look at me.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.652
- Phone you tomorrow.
- Don't look at me.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.951
- Might even phone you tonight.
- Don't look at me.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.120
Definitely gonna phone you,
gorgeous girl.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.414
Definitely better.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.366
Ordinary Yale lock,
but nothing fits.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.390
Welcome.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.646
- Where am I?
- 1969.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.103
Not bad, as it goes. You've got
the moon landing to look forward to.

23:12.182 --> 23:15.152
Oh, the moon landing's brilliant!
We went four times.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.901
- Back when we had transport.
- Working on it.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.074
- How did I get here?
- Same way we did.

23:20.149 --> 23:23.278
Touch of an angel. Same one, probably,
since you ended up in the same year.

23:23.360 --> 23:27.115
No, no, no. Don't get up.
Time travel without a capsule, nasty.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.620
Catch your breath,
don't go swimming for half an hour.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.327
I don't... I can't...

23:31.410 --> 23:33.913
Fascinating race, the weeping angels.

23:33.996 --> 23:36.795
The only psychopaths in the universe
to kill you nicely.

23:36.874 --> 23:40.595
No mess, no fuss, they just zap you
into the past and let you live to death,

23:40.669 --> 23:44.674
the rest of your life used up
and blown away in the blink of an eye.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.360
You die in the past and in the present

23:46.467 --> 23:49.346
they consume the energy
of all the days you might have had.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.977
All your stolen moments.

23:52.056 --> 23:55.731
They're creatures of the abstract,
they live off potential energy.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.561
What in God's name
are you talking about?

23:57.645 --> 24:00.364
Trust me, just nod
when he stops for breath.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.694
Tracked you down with this.
This is my timey-wimey detector.

24:05.611 --> 24:09.832
Goes "bing" when there's stuff.
Also, it can boil an egg at 30 paces.

24:09.907 --> 24:13.582
Whether you want it to or not, actually,
so I've learnt to stay away from hens.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.959
It's not pretty when they blow.

24:16.747 --> 24:20.468
- I don't understand. Where am I?
- 1969, like he said.

24:20.542 --> 24:24.763
Normally, I'd offer you a lift home,
but somebody nicked my motor.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.510
So I need you to take
a message to Sally Sparrow.

24:30.010 --> 24:34.106
And I'm sorry, Billy,
I am very, very sorry.

24:35.057 --> 24:38.152
It's gonna take you a while.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.106
Hello?

24:42.564 --> 24:45.067
Billy, where are you?

24:46.068 --> 24:47.320
Where?

25:04.962 --> 25:06.214
Billy?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.617
It was raining when we met.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.155
It's the same rain.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.470
- She looks nice.
- Her name was Sally, too.

25:46.962 --> 25:50.341
- Sally Shipton.
- Sally Shipton.

25:54.803 --> 25:58.182
I often thought about looking for you
before tonight.

25:58.265 --> 26:02.315
But apparently it would have torn
a hole in the fabric of space and time

26:02.478 --> 26:05.482
and destroyed
two thirds of the universe.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.410
Also, I'd lost my hair.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.565
Two thirds of the universe?
Where'd you get that from?

26:13.614 --> 26:17.835
There's a man in 1969.
He sent me with a message for you.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.504
- What man?
- The Doctor.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.709
- And what was the message?
- Just this,

26:24.833 --> 26:27.461
- look at the list.
- What does that mean?

26:27.544 --> 26:30.764
- Is that it? Look at the list?
- He said you'd have it by now.

26:30.839 --> 26:33.183
A list of 17 DVDs.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.609
I didn't stay a policeman back then.

26:41.683 --> 26:45.529
Got into publishing,
then video publishing.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.445
Then DVDs, of course.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.323
You put the Easter egg on.

26:54.696 --> 26:58.417
Have you noticed
what all 17 DVDs have in common yet?

26:59.201 --> 27:02.296
I suppose it's hard for you in a way.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.294
How could the Doctor have even known
I had a list?

27:05.374 --> 27:07.502
- I only just got this.
- I asked him how,

27:07.626 --> 27:10.971
but he said he couldn't tell me.

27:11.046 --> 27:16.894
He said you'd understand it one clay,
but that I never would.

27:17.511 --> 27:20.435
Soon as I understand it,
I'll come and tell you.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.060
No, gorgeous girl. You can't.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.604
There's only tonight.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.608
He told me all those years ago,
that we'll only meet again

27:30.732 --> 27:32.234
this one time.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.737
On the night I die.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.823
Oh, Billy.

27:37.906 --> 27:42.207
It's kept me going.
I'm an old, sick man.

27:42.286 --> 27:45.460
But I've had
something to look forward to.

27:49.585 --> 27:54.432
Ah, life is long and you are hot.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.096
Look at my hands.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.274
An old man's hands.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.319
How did that happen?

28:09.771 --> 28:13.992
I'll stay.
I'm gonna stay with you, okay?

28:15.068 --> 28:17.070
Thank you, Sally Sparrow.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.334
I have till the rain stops.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.787
- Bantos.
- They're mine.

28:58.862 --> 28:59.954
What?

29:00.072 --> 29:04.168
The DVDs on the list, the 17 DVDs,
what they've got in common is me.

29:04.243 --> 29:08.043
They're all the DVDs I own.
The Easter egg was intended for me.

29:08.497 --> 29:13.094
- You've only got 17 DVDs?
- Do you have a portable DVD player?

29:13.168 --> 29:15.216
- Of course. Why?
- I want you to meet me.

29:15.337 --> 29:16.634
Where?

29:16.713 --> 29:18.511
Wester Drumlins.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.186
I knew you would live
in Scooby Doo's house.

29:24.346 --> 29:27.020
For God's sake, I don't live here.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.524
Okay. This is the one
with the clearest sound.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.446
Slightly better picture quality
on this one,

29:33.522 --> 29:35.650
- but I don't know...
- Doesn't matter.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.029
Okay.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.585
There he is.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.753
- The Doctor.
- Who's a doctor?

29:55.877 --> 29:58.551
- He's the Doctor.
- Yup, that's me.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.425
- Okay, that was scary.
- No, it sounds like he's replying,

30:01.550 --> 30:03.473
- but he always says that.
- Yes, Ida.

30:03.593 --> 30:06.472
- And that.
- Yup. And this.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.307
He can hear us.

30:08.432 --> 30:11.436
- Oh, my God. You can really hear us.
- Of course he can't hear us.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.903
Look.

30:14.521 --> 30:17.274
I've got a transcript, see?
Everything he says.

30:17.399 --> 30:20.573
"Yup, that's me." "Yes, I do."
"Yup, and this." Next, it's...

30:20.652 --> 30:22.996
Are you gonna read
out the whole thing?

30:23.113 --> 30:24.160
Sorry.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.661
Who are you?

30:25.741 --> 30:30.998
I'm a time traveller. or! was.
I'm stuck in 1969.

30:31.413 --> 30:34.041
We 're stuck. All of space and time,
he promised me.

30:34.124 --> 30:36.343
Now I've got a job in a shop.
I've gotta support him!

30:36.418 --> 30:38.045
- Martha!
- Sorry.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.055
I've seen this bit before.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.848
Quite possibly.

30:42.257 --> 30:46.262
- 1969, that's where you're talking from?
- Afraid so.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.148
But you're replying to me.

30:49.222 --> 30:52.601
You can't know exactly what
I'm gonna say 40 years before I say it.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.731
38.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.938
I'm getting this down.
I'm writing in your bits.

30:56.063 --> 30:59.658
- How? How is this possible? Tell me.
- Not so fast.

30:59.900 --> 31:03.530
People don't understand time.
It's not what you think it is.

31:03.612 --> 31:04.909
Then what is it?

31:04.988 --> 31:07.241
- Complicated
- Tell me.

31:07.491 --> 31:10.961
- Very complicated.
- I'm clever and I'm listening.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.130
And don't patronise me
because people have died

31:13.246 --> 31:15.795
and I'm not happy. Tell me.

31:17.417 --> 31:21.047
People assume that time is
a strict progression of cause to effect

31:21.129 --> 31:23.928
but actually, from a non-linear,
non-subjective viewpoint,

31:24.007 --> 31:29.309
it's more like a big ball
of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.

31:29.429 --> 31:30.806
Yeah, I've seen this bit before.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.766
You said that sentence got away
from you.

31:32.849 --> 31:34.601
It got away from me, yeah.

31:34.684 --> 31:37.813
Next thing you're gonna say is,
"Well, I can hear you."

31:37.896 --> 31:39.148
Well, I can hear you.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.155
- This is impossible.
- No. It's brilliant!

31:42.234 --> 31:45.864
Well, not hear you, exactly,
but I know everything you're gonna say.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.115
Always gives me the shivers, that bit.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.826
How can you know what I'm gonna say?

31:50.909 --> 31:54.004
- Look to your left.
- What's he mean by "look to your left"?

31:54.121 --> 31:55.801
I've written tons about that
in the forums.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.925
I think it's a political statement.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.673
He means you. What are you doing?

32:01.711 --> 32:03.133
I'm writing in your bits.

32:03.213 --> 32:06.387
That way, I've got a complete transcript
of the whole conversation.

32:06.550 --> 32:10.726
Wait until this hits the Net.
This will explode the egg forums.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.521
I've got a copy of the finished
transcript, it's on my Autocue.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.226
How can you have
a copy of the finished transcript?

32:16.351 --> 32:17.853
It's still being written.

32:17.978 --> 32:20.527
I told you, I'm a time traveller.
I got it in the future.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.482
Okay, let me get my head round this.

32:22.566 --> 32:26.446
You're reading aloud from a transcript
of a conversation you're still having.

32:26.528 --> 32:29.372
Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey...

32:29.448 --> 32:32.543
Actually, never mind that.
You can do shorthand?

32:33.660 --> 32:35.082
So?

32:35.162 --> 32:38.837
What matters is we can communicate.
We have got big problems now.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.218
They have taken the blue box,
haven 't they?

32:41.334 --> 32:43.132
The angels have the phone box?

32:43.295 --> 32:45.548
"The angels have the phone box",
that's my favourite.

32:45.672 --> 32:49.142
- I've got that on a T-shirt.
- What do you mean, angels?

32:49.217 --> 32:53.518
- You mean those statue things?
- Creatures from another world.

32:53.722 --> 32:56.020
- But they're just statues.
- On! y when you see them.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.476
What does that mean?

32:57.559 --> 32:59.903
The Lonely Assassins
they used to be called.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.777
No one quite knows where they came from,
but they're as old as the universe,

33:02.856 --> 33:04.858
or very nearly,
and they have survived this long

33:04.941 --> 33:08.036
because they have the most perfect
defence system ever evolved.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.700
They are quantum locked.

33:09.779 --> 33:11.747
They don't exist
when they're being observed.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.201
The moment they are seen
by any other living creature,

33:14.284 --> 33:15.877
they freeze into rock.

33:15.952 --> 33:19.502
No choice, it's a fact of their biology.
In the sight of any living thing,

33:19.581 --> 33:21.925
they literally turn to stone.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.591
And you can '2' kill a stone.

33:24.669 --> 33:28.344
Course, a stone can't kill you, either,
but then you turn your head away.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.050
Then you blink.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.976
And, oh, yes, it can.

33:32.636 --> 33:36.561
- Don't take your eyes off that.
- That'.s why they cover their eyes.

33:36.765 --> 33:39.439
They're not weeping,
they can't risk looking at each other.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.362
Their greatest asset
is their greatest curse.

33:42.437 --> 33:47.113
They can never be seen.
Loneliest creatures in the universe.

33:47.901 --> 33:52.372
Well, I'm sorry. I am very, very sorry.
It's up to you now.

33:53.406 --> 33:56.330
- What am I supposed to do?
- The blue box. It's my time machine.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.375
There is a world of time energy in there
they could feast on forever,

33:59.454 --> 34:02.424
but the damage they could do
could switch off the sun.

34:02.499 --> 34:05.878
- You have got to send it back to me.
- H ow?

34:05.961 --> 34:07.463
H ow?

34:08.420 --> 34:11.469
And that's it, I'm afraid.
There's no more from you

34:11.550 --> 34:14.520
on the transcript,
that's the last I've got.

34:14.594 --> 34:17.518
I don't know what stopped you talking,
but I can guess. They're coming.

34:17.639 --> 34:18.891
The angels are coming for you.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.693
But listen,
your life could depend on this.

34:21.810 --> 34:25.405
Don '1' blink. Don't even blink.
Blink and you're dead.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.527
They are fast.
Faster than you can believe.

34:27.607 --> 34:32.454
Don't turn your back,
don't look away and don't blink.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.989
Good luck.

34:36.824 --> 34:39.293
No, don't. You can't!

34:40.161 --> 34:42.835
- I'll rewind him.
- What good will that do?

34:44.666 --> 34:47.966
- You're not looking at the statue.
- Neither are you.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.677
Keep looking at it. Keep looking at it.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.231
It's just one, right?
It's just this one.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.855
We're okay if we just keep staring
at this one statue.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.061
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- There's three more.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.062
- Three?
- They were upstairs before,

35:06.146 --> 35:08.490
- but I think I heard them moving.
- Moving? Three of them?

35:08.565 --> 35:11.034
- Moving where?
- I'm gonna look around. I'm gonna check.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.407
You keep looking at this one.
Don't blink.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.363
Remember what he said. Don't even blink.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.911
Who blinked? I'm too scared to blink.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.786
Okay, we're going to the door.
Front door.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.297
Okay, we can't both get
to the front door

35:28.376 --> 35:30.470
without taking our eyes off that thing,
so you stay here.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.297
- What?
- I'll be just round the corner.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.098
You stay here.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.642
They've locked it! They've locked us in.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.224
- Why?
- I've got something they want.

35:42.349 --> 35:43.942
- What?
- The key.

35:44.059 --> 35:46.733
I took it last time I was here.
They followed me to get it back.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.155
I led them to the blue box.
Now they've got that.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.779
Give them the key.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.236
I'm gonna check the back door.
You wait here.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.742
Give them the key!
Give them what they want!

35:58.531 --> 36:02.252
- Sally, no! What if they come behind me?
- Hang on!

36:03.787 --> 36:04.913
God.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.760
- Oh, God.
- It's locked!

36:17.008 --> 36:19.932
Sally! Sally!

36:23.098 --> 36:25.817
It won't open!

36:30.355 --> 36:32.824
Sally, please, I can't do this!

36:37.696 --> 36:39.949
Sally, hurry UP!

36:41.574 --> 36:43.702
Where are you?

36:44.452 --> 36:49.208
Larry, they've blocked up the back door,
but there's a cellar.

36:49.582 --> 36:52.381
There might be a way out.
Delivery hatch or something.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.798
I'm coming! I can't stay here.

37:16.192 --> 37:19.162
Okay, boys. We know how this works.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.995
You can't move so long as I can see you.

37:28.997 --> 37:31.716
A whole world in the box,
the Doctor says.

37:31.791 --> 37:35.295
I hope he's not lying 'cause I don't see
how else we're getting out.

37:40.049 --> 37:42.268
Oh, and there's your one.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.486
Why is it pointing at the...

37:53.021 --> 37:54.398
light?

37:56.024 --> 37:58.527
Oh, my God, it's turning out the light!

37:58.610 --> 38:00.829
- Quickly!
- I can't find the lock!

38:00.904 --> 38:02.531
Sally, hurry UP!

38:04.365 --> 38:06.208
Get it open!

38:06.284 --> 38:10.164
- They're getting faster, Sally! Come on!
- It won't turn!

38:12.207 --> 38:14.960
- I can't turn it!
- Sally! Oh!

38:16.169 --> 38:18.592
Sally, hurry up! Come on!

38:33.311 --> 38:36.315
This is Security Protocol 772.

38:36.689 --> 38:40.444
This time capsule has detected the
presence of an authorised control disc,

38:40.527 --> 38:42.450
valid one journey.

38:45.114 --> 38:48.414
Please insert the disc
and prepare for departure.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.084
Looks like a DVD player. There's a slot.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.256
- They're trying to get in!
- Well, hurry up, then!

39:15.103 --> 39:18.277
- What's happening?
- Oh, my God, it's leaving us behind.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.776
Doctor, don't! You can't!

39:31.953 --> 39:34.172
Doctor!

39:47.385 --> 39:49.808
Look at them! Quick, look at them!

39:53.683 --> 39:55.902
I don't think we need to.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.073
He tricked them.
The Doctor tricked them.

40:00.148 --> 40:03.618
They're looking at each other.
They're never gonna move again.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.616
Can you mind the shop? I'm just nipping
next door for some milk.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.309
Yeah, no worries.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.858
- What's this?
- Nothing.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.367
Sally.

40:53.743 --> 40:56.462
- Can't you let it go?
- Of course I can't let it go.

40:56.579 --> 40:57.876
This is over.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.459
How did the Doctor know
where to write those words on the wall?

41:00.541 --> 41:02.259
How could he get
a copy of the transcript?

41:02.335 --> 41:04.258
Where did he get
all that information from?

41:04.379 --> 41:08.304
Look, some things you never find out
and that's okay.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.010
No, it isn't.

41:14.806 --> 41:17.776
Ever think this might be getting
in the way of

41:19.227 --> 41:21.025
other things?

41:22.897 --> 41:25.070
We just run a shop together.

41:25.942 --> 41:28.411
That's all it is, just a shop.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.916
Anyway. Milk.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.128
Back in a mo.

41:52.802 --> 41:55.726
- Right, it's definitely this way.
- Okay.

41:58.016 --> 42:01.941
- Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!
- Hello. Sorry, bit of a rush.

42:02.061 --> 42:04.860
There's a sort of thing happening.
Very important that we stop it.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.239
Oh, my God, it's you. It really is you.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.194
Oh, you don't remember me, do you?

42:10.278 --> 42:12.372
Doctor, we haven't got time for this.
Migration's started.

42:12.447 --> 42:15.371
Look, sorry,
I've got a bit of a complex life.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.828
Things don't always happen to me
in quite the right order.

42:17.952 --> 42:20.250
Gets a bit confusing at times,
especially at weddings.

42:20.329 --> 42:22.707
I'm rubbish at weddings,
especially my own.

42:22.790 --> 42:25.543
Oh, my God, of course!
You're a time traveller.

42:25.626 --> 42:28.675
It hasn't happened to you yet,
none of it. It's still in your future.

42:28.755 --> 42:31.383
- What hasn't happened?
- Doctor, please! 20 minutes to hatching.

42:31.466 --> 42:35.312
It was me! Oh, for God's sake,
it was me all along.

42:35.428 --> 42:38.056
- You got it all from me.
- Got what?

42:38.139 --> 42:43.066
Okay, listen. One day,
you're gonna get stuck in 1969.

42:43.144 --> 42:45.818
Make sure you've got this with you.
You're gonna need it.

42:45.897 --> 42:48.150
- Doctor!
- Yeah! Listen, listen, gotta dash.

42:48.232 --> 42:52.783
Things happening. Well, four things.
Well, four things and a lizard.

42:52.862 --> 42:56.662
Okay, no worries. On you go.
See you around some day.

42:57.825 --> 43:01.125
- What was your name?
- Sally Sparrow.

43:01.204 --> 43:03.332
Good to meet you, Sally Sparrow.

43:15.343 --> 43:17.220
Goodbye, Doctor.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.246
Don't blink.

43:40.368 --> 43:41.665
Blink and you're dead.

43:44.372 --> 43:45.840
Don '2' turn your back.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.465
Don't look away.

43:51.003 --> 43:52.880
And don't blink.

43:59.387 --> 44:00.730
Good luck.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.738
We're going to the end of the universe.

44:09.814 --> 44:14.069
The call came from across
the stars, over and over again,

44:14.152 --> 44:15.449
"Come to Utopia."

44:15.528 --> 44:17.246
- Doctor.
- Captain.

44:27.415 --> 44:28.462
It's a future time.

44:28.541 --> 44:29.667
Utopia is...

44:29.750 --> 44:33.254
The last of the humans,
scattered across the night.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.680
Humans are coming.

44:34.755 --> 44:38.259
Not even us Time Lords came this far.
We should leave.
