00:04.840 --> 00:06.155
Previously on E.R.

00:06.190 --> 00:08.630
Did you work on Edgar Dixon today?

00:08.840 --> 00:10.535
Yeah,yeah,yeah. Um,why? What's up?

00:10.570 --> 00:13.610
First Mission Baptist is dispensing
meds without a pharmacy license.

00:13.645 --> 00:15.420
It's a felony,Pratt. A man died.

00:15.455 --> 00:16.720
Thank you for the hot dog.

00:16.755 --> 00:17.920
It's my pleasure.

00:18.700 --> 00:19.755
I'll catch you later,Joe.

00:19.790 --> 00:21.145
So,how long you staying,Gracie?

00:21.180 --> 00:23.050
Just till you   row me out,not a bit
longer.

00:23.085 --> 00:24.332
Luka,this is...

00:24.367 --> 00:25.580
- Eddie. - Eddie.

00:27.760 --> 00:28.830
Nobody called you a whore.

00:28.865 --> 00:29.585
My mom did.

00:29.620 --> 00:30.715
Your mom's mistaken.

00:30.750 --> 00:32.400
I'm gonna find budget cuts somewhere
else.

00:32.435 --> 00:33.590
There is no way we're losing.

00:33.625 --> 00:35.580
Thanks,but I resign.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.075
<i>"A HOUSE DIVDEDE" This is Dr. Abby
Lockhart.</i>

00:39.110 --> 00:41.540
<i>I'm calling from County General, and
ca  you te   him</i>

00:41.575 --> 00:42.965
I   t   s la  result

00:43.000 --> 00:45.710
and he needs to come in   and discuss
them?

00:46.690 --> 00:48.080
Th  ks.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.730
Since when do   u call E.R. patients
from home?

00:51.190 --> 00:53.080
I was worried about th   guy.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.735
I want to ma   sure he gets seen.

00:54.770 --> 00:57.638
Isn't that more of a job for his
imar  care physician?

00:57.885 --> 00:59.135
He doesn't have one.

00:59.170 --> 01:02.289
Well,no incentive to get  ne if you'r
gonna make h  se  alls.

01:04.950 --> 01:09.360
I phoned his hotel to make sure he
comes    for follow-up.

01:09.395 --> 01:10.740
Hotel?

01:11.240 --> 01:12.835
Yes,he's from out of town.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.610
- Who is this guy? - It's Eddie
Jackson. You met hi

01:17.350 --> 01:18.460
What?

01:19.080 --> 01:19.675
Nothing.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.245
Well,why are you acting weird?

01:21.280 --> 01:23.823
Hmm,I just... I j  t think   it's a lit
e strange

01:23.910 --> 01:26.523
the amount of   rsonal attention
u seem to be giving some guy

01:26.815 --> 01:29.040
you met in a b  .

01:29.590 --> 01:30.966
<i>   You di  't talk to her,di
you?</i>

01:31.035 --> 01:33.170
I didn't  ee her.

01:34.670 --> 01:36.735
I thought you were gonna talk to her
last night.

01:36.770 --> 01:40.306
Yeah,but   got home so lat  and she was
excited about how well

01:40.455 --> 01:42.540
she did on her history
presentation,so...

01:42.575 --> 01:43.115
Tony...

01:43.150 --> 01:45.150
I'm gonn  do it. I'm gonna do it.

01:45.780 --> 01:48.100
You've  een saying that for   week.

01:48.135 --> 01:50.420
She needs to hear this from you.

01:50.950 --> 01:52.905
She needs to know that it was your
idea,

01:52.940 --> 01:54.860
otherwise,   she'll never forgive me.

01:54.895 --> 01:56.870
I right,I'll tell her.

01:56.905 --> 01:58.810
Tonight,I promise.

02:03.630 --> 02:05.365
<i>Oh,man,would you     look at this
board?</i>

02:05.400 --> 02:09.680
We got cough,cough and vomiting,itchy
feet,diarrhea, diar  ea and vomitin

02:09.715 --> 02:11.682
I haven't seen a decent trauma my last
three shifts.

02:11.717 --> 02:13.615
People are getting too damned careful
these days.

02:13.650 --> 02:16.250
Chop  r's bringing in some kind of
snowmobile accident.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.980
Ca  ed it.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.400 --> 02:31.535
- Is this the snowmobile? - Yeah,one of
'em.

02:31.570 --> 02:33.670
Clar   Sutton,13,lost control and hit a
fence.

02:33.705 --> 02:35.387
It was an accident.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.070
I was trying to turn.

02:37.690 --> 02:38.525
Where's Dennis?

02:38.560 --> 02:40.170
McKay's unloading the older brother.

02:40.205 --> 02:41.745
I think this one got the wo  t of it.

02:41.780 --> 02:44.200
His brother carried him almost a mile
to get help.

02:44.590 --> 02:46.820
Can I be in the same room with Dennis?

02:47.620 --> 02:48.805
It hurts to breathe.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.700
Okay,try   t to talk. Gates,  hy don't
you go up to the roof,

02:50.735 --> 02:51.775
grab the next one? I'll take this.

02:51.810 --> 02:52.545
- No,I got this covered. - Nah,I got
this one.

02:52.580 --> 02:53.790
Nah,I got this one. who knows how to
treat him,all ri  t?

02:53.790 --> 02:55.957
This kid needs treatment, Okay?

02:55.957 --> 02:57.330
And that'd be me. I'll call you if I
need you.

02:57.365 --> 02:58.687
Okay,guys,knock it off Come on.

02:58.722 --> 02:59.975
Okay,who gets this patient?

03:00.010 --> 03:02.510
Me,if you're gonna act like babies then
that's how I'll treat  ou.

03:02.545 --> 03:03.615
Luka,sats are dropping

03:03.650 --> 03:06.230
Okay,bag him. Abby,run ahead and
intubate.

03:06.780 --> 03:07.305
Way to go.

03:07.340 --> 03:08.305
This was your fault.

03:08.340 --> 03:09.775
- Yeah,right. - Yeah,I am right.

03:09.810 --> 03:11.910
- Don't be an idiot. - Ass for brains.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.675
Edgar never liked to talk about his
troubles.

03:15.710 --> 03:18.500
In fact,the only thing he ever talked
about was football.

03:19.110 --> 03:20.665
*****

03:20.700 --> 03:23.475
But I remember... one Sunday Edgar
looked troubled,

03:23.510 --> 03:27.020
and I said to him "Well,is there
anything I could do for you?"

03:27.055 --> 03:29.897
So he said,"No,no,Pastor,you can't help
my problem. "

03:29.932 --> 03:32.740
I said,  ell,maybe I can't,but I know
someone who can.

03:32.775 --> 03:34.420
You know,God always listens. "

03:34.455 --> 03:36.040
Oh,amen.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.345
Dr. Pratt.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.550
Pastor,that was a nice service.

03:41.585 --> 03:43.550
- Thank you. - Very nice.

03:45.490 --> 03:50.950
Um,Mrs. Dixon, I just w    d to pass on
my condolences once again.

03:51.630 --> 03:53.245
I just,  ,

03:53.280 --> 03:55.650
want to let you know if there's
anything,

03:55.685 --> 03:57.735
anything I can do,

03:57.770 --> 04:00.720
please don't hesitate to call the
hospital.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.220
Thank you,Dr. Pratt.

04:04.255 --> 04:06.270
Thank you.

04:13.935 --> 04:16.589
ER Season 13 Episode 13

04:18.180 --> 04:19.550
Greg!

04:21.910 --> 04:23.670
The Medical Board called me.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.295
I bet they did.

04:25.330 --> 04:28.570
They said that they're issuing a letter
for us to cease and desist our drug
program.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.870
at's not a surprise.

04:30.905 --> 04:32.700
I told 'em to go to hell.

04:32.735 --> 04:33.765
You did what?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.285
They don't understand what we're doing.

04:35.320 --> 04:38.110
Yeah,but I'm sure they got a pretty
clear idea now.

04:38.490 --> 04:40.555
Look,I like what you're doing,but it
doesn't work.

04:40.590 --> 04:43.790
People need a continuity of care and
the church clinic isn't open every day.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.990
How many people do you think we've
helped since we started this program?

04:47.920 --> 04:49.290
I'm sorry.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.170
Well,we're not giving up on the
program.

04:52.205 --> 04:53.395
Then you're headed for trouble.

04:53.430 --> 04:55.740
My people have now  re else to turn to.

04:55.775 --> 04:57.740
They're already in trouble.

04:58.410 --> 04:59.880
I'm out.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.525
Sats are drifting into the 70s.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.835
Come on,Clarke,stay with us.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.110
- Want me to do that? - No.

05:10.145 --> 05:11.245
- You sure? - Yeah.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.630
If you want to help,you can give me
some cricoid.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.240
I got blood here. What do you want?

05:15.480 --> 05:16.750
Uh,CBC,LFTs,chem7...

05:16.785 --> 05:17.985
I'm in. Bag him.

05:18.020 --> 05:18.965
...UA and a blood gas.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.130
You're probably not gonna need that.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.470
Decreased on the left. Pull back the ET
tube.

05:27.505 --> 05:28.715
No,I stopped just past the cords.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.130
Well,it's obviously not,so pull it
back.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.900
I'm gonna call the Blood Bank.

05:32.935 --> 05:34.770
Uh,good idea.

05:36.780 --> 05:39.740
Still decreased. Sterile sixes and a
chest tube tray.

05:39.775 --> 05:42.080
Hold on. Let's not  ump the gun.

05:42.210 --> 05:44.650
He's got a bruise   d bad sats. I'm not
jumping the gun.

05:44.685 --> 05:45.655
It's a pneumothorax.

05:45.690 --> 05:47.310
Right,I'll call for a portable chest.

05:47.345 --> 05:48.195
Good,good.

05:48.230 --> 05:49.515
Let's see what we're dealing with here
first.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.820
20% of all pneumothoraces are missed on
X ray. You taught me that.

05:52.855 --> 05:54.245
Nice to know you were listening.

05:54.280 --> 05:57.180
We have time to wait for the film
before we start cutting.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.040
What about the sliding lung sign?

06:01.580 --> 06:04.110
Okay,lungs are up. No hemothorax or rib
fractures.

06:04.145 --> 06:06.362
What's happening with Clarke? Why isn't
he sitting u

06:06.397 --> 06:08.580
They put a tube down his throat to help
him breathe.

06:08.615 --> 06:10.200
Good bowel sounds.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.670
He got the wind knocked out of him. I
had to carry him to the road.

06:13.705 --> 06:14.795
It's a good thing you did.

06:14.830 --> 06:17.440
Crits 38,pressure's still good; 122/76.

06:17.475 --> 06:19.125
Let me know if anything's sore.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.942
He kept begging me to let him drive
His father's gonna kill me.

06:22.065 --> 06:24.180
Wait. I thought you two were brothers.

06:24.215 --> 06:26.115
He's my stepbrother.

06:26.150 --> 06:29.580
My dad died when I was little. My mom
remarried in August.

06:29.615 --> 06:31.950
He thinks I'm a screw-up. This i  't
going to help.

06:31.985 --> 06:33.380
Pretty much wrecked his snowmobile. Ow!

06:34.160 --> 06:35.935
All right,left lower quadrant. Call
Surgery.

06:35.970 --> 06:38.580
Not so fast. It's not a contusion. It's
an abrasion.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.240
He's guarding.

06:42.850 --> 06:43.765
Do you have to keep doing that?

06:43.800 --> 06:46.965
I'm sorry. He's hemodynamically
stable,and his crit's good.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.540
Let's get a CT of his belly,and if it's
normal, then we won't have to waste a
surgeon's time.

06:50.575 --> 06:52.340
Well,I'm going to have to disagree with
your assessment.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.245
Ah,okay.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.550
Let's run it by Kovac.

06:55.585 --> 06:57.630
Let's not.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.700
I decide when we present to an
attending.

07:02.190 --> 07:03.765
No lung sliding.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.305
What the hell is lung sliding anyway?

07:05.340 --> 07:07.695
Normally there's lung movement on
ultrasound.

07:07.730 --> 07:10.110
If i  s not there,then the lung must be
partially deflated.

07:10.145 --> 07:11.795
Showoff.

07:11.830 --> 07:14.360
Okay,chest tube tray to Abby.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.270
What? You don't want to do it now?

07:18.305 --> 07:20.250
I wanted to do it 15 minutes ago.

07:26.160 --> 07:30.890
Well,it looks like Abby was right and
Luka confirmed the diagnosis
radiographically.

07:30.925 --> 07:32.750
Good work,team.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.050
What the hell do I have to do to get
someone to come down here?

07:37.085 --> 07:39.980
Dr. Gates from the E.R. That's with an
"E"   for "emergency. "

07:40.015 --> 07:41.295
You called for a consult?

07:41.330 --> 07:43.060
Actually,I dialed the Hot Surgeons chat
line.

07:43.095 --> 07:44.535
Which room?

07:44.570 --> 07:45.925
What's the matter? No,"Hey,how you
doing?

07:45.960 --> 07:48.640
You look sexy in that white suit"?
Hey,what's wrong?

07:49.150 --> 07:52.550
You mean besides the fact the last time
I saw youthe woman that you liv  with
practically assaulted me

07:52.585 --> 07:54.520
and her daughter called me a whore?

07:55.530 --> 07:56.835
I told you I was sorry.

07:56.870 --> 08:00.400
I don't live with her anymore.Not for
long,anyway.

08:01.210 --> 08:03.000
How's Sarah?

08:03.430 --> 08:05.325
We're working through it.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.050
No blood out. It's not the
chest.Xeroform and the thoroseal.

08:08.085 --> 08:09.435
Could be cardiac contusion.

08:09.470 --> 08:12.480
Get a 12-lead and hold off on the
blooduntil the troponin's back.

08:12.515 --> 08:13.737
CT's ready.I'll take him up.

08:13.772 --> 08:14.960
- I'll take him.- You sure?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.850
Yeah,in case he crashes.

08:25.050 --> 08:27.425
Well,that wasn't awkward.

08:27.460 --> 08:30.630
Further proof workplace romance,bad
idea.

08:30.665 --> 08:31.717
Is that so?

08:31.752 --> 08:32.735
Uh,yeah.

08:32.770 --> 08:36.210
Hey,look,the other night you
kindacaught me off guard with that
kiss,

08:36.245 --> 08:39.169
and I don't... I have a ruleagainst
dating people at work.

08:39.450 --> 08:40.205
You do?

08:40.240 --> 08:42.850
Yeah,it's kind of a new rule.

08:42.885 --> 08:44.184
Uh,yeah.

08:44.220 --> 08:46.295
But a solid rule.

08:46.330 --> 08:48.370
That's cool,really.

08:52.580 --> 08:55.980
This is Dennis' father,Gary.Gary,this
is Dr. Gates

08:56.015 --> 08:57.137
and Dr. Rasgotra.

08:57.172 --> 08:58.225
Where's Clarke?

08:58.260 --> 09:00.010
Oh,upstairs for more X rays.

09:00.045 --> 09:01.697
Is this a social visit?

09:01.732 --> 09:03.351
Tony asked for a consult.

09:03.386 --> 09:04.935
I hope you're happy now.

09:04.970 --> 09:07.435
I'm sorry. We were being really
careful.

09:07.470 --> 09:11.070
You obviously weren't being carefulif
you put Clarke in the hospital.

09:11.570 --> 09:13.580
I want to see my son.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.280
Where is he?!

09:15.870 --> 09:16.955
Uh,Lily,could you?

09:16.990 --> 09:18.280
I can take you to him,sir.

09:18.315 --> 09:19.635
Thank you.

09:19.670 --> 09:22.890
You better pray he's all right.

09:28.930 --> 09:31.250
Uh,Neela,I'm sorry youhad to come down
here.

09:31.285 --> 09:33.475
Um,he doesn't need a co  ult.

09:33.510 --> 09:35.760
Oh,well,I'm here nowand I'm almost
finished.

09:35.795 --> 09:39.285
Okay,fine,then can you explain to him
why

09:39.320 --> 09:41.785
Actually,I'm suggesting weadmit him for
observation.

09:41.820 --> 09:44.750
Why? His kidneys look good.His liver
and spleen appear to be normal.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.335
Did I miss something on the CT?

09:46.370 --> 09:49.210
Well,an occult injurycould take time to
declare itself.

09:49.245 --> 09:50.875
- He's right.- No,he's not.

09:50.910 --> 09:52.735
The surgeon concurs with my assessment.

09:52.770 --> 09:55.910
Hey,don't worry,boss.I'm not one of
those "I told you so" kids.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.430
Can I speak to you outside?

09:57.465 --> 09:58.940
- Certainly.- Okay.

09:58.975 --> 10:00.500
Not you.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.220
Sammy.

10:02.255 --> 10:03.600
Hi,guys.

10:04.180 --> 10:05.245
Ben,hello.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.830
Hey,Gracie. What's up,Alex?

10:06.865 --> 10:07.990
Hey.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.900
Alex is signing up for theVolunteen
program today.

10:10.935 --> 10:12.835
He's real excited about it.

10:12.870 --> 10:15.850
I had to practicallydrag him here by
his ears.

10:16.260 --> 10:18.615
Alex,even if you volunteerfor a couple
hours a week,

10:18.650 --> 10:20.970
it'll still help on yourcollege
applications,okay?

10:21.005 --> 10:22.215
And maybe you'll even like it.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.175
Just keep telling yourself that,Mom.

10:24.210 --> 10:26.310
When I was your age,I had two jobs.

10:26.345 --> 10:28.410
Yeah,doing what,milking the T-Rex?

10:29.060 --> 10:31.730
I worked on the Milfords'farm before
school,smartass,

10:31.765 --> 10:33.605
and at night I worked in Addison's
Bakery.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.180
If you'd like,I could take Alex to
thevolunteer center,show him around a
bit.

10:36.215 --> 10:37.585
That's great. Thank you,Ben.

10:37.620 --> 10:40.405
Well,actually,I probably know this
hospitalbetter than you do.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.230
That's great. Then you can give me the
tour'cause I still can't find the gift
shop. Come on.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.240
He gets cuter every time I see him.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.355
Ben.

10:51.390 --> 10:53.050
I heard you.

10:54.410 --> 10:56.685
You should be going after that one.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.840
It's a little tricky datingsomeone you
work with.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.655
What's tricky about it?

11:01.690 --> 11:03.440
Having sex without getting caught?

11:03.475 --> 11:04.925
- Gracie...- Look,honey,

11:04.960 --> 11:07.860
I know what your life has been like.

11:08.370 --> 11:11.190
Trust me,Sammy,I know.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.830
All the women in our family are the
same-

11:14.865 --> 11:18.210
very fertile,allergic to chestnuts,

11:18.245 --> 11:20.802
prone to bladder infections...

11:20.837 --> 11:23.360
And we all have that damn gene

11:23.395 --> 11:25.250
that predi  oses us

11:25.285 --> 11:27.130
to bad boys.

11:27.350 --> 11:28.465
Chestnuts?

11:28.500 --> 11:30.200
Sammy,life is short.

11:30.235 --> 11:31.972
You deserve to be happy.

11:32.007 --> 11:33.675
You deserve a good man.

11:33.710 --> 11:37.110
If you like this guy,go for it.

11:38.310 --> 11:41.570
Okay,the least you can do is give mean
honest and professional opinion.

11:41.605 --> 11:42.845
- I did.- No,you didn't.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.260
Well,how would you know?You're not a
surgeon.

11:44.295 --> 11:45.820
Neither are you.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.175
Sorry. Sorry,look...

11:49.210 --> 11:51.320
- No,you look. I came down,I
assessed...- We established... You
shouldn't have come down...

11:51.355 --> 11:52.395
- I made a professional call. If- you
disagree with my opinion...

11:52.430 --> 11:54.580
- ... it's personal,just like your
visit.- ... fine,tha  s your
prerogative.

11:54.615 --> 11:56.612
- What you can't do... The reason- why
you're siding with Gates

11:56.647 --> 11:58.610
- is because you're screwing him.- ...
is accuse me of being...

11:59.190 --> 12:01.310
I can't believe you just said that.

12:01.870 --> 12:02.625
So it's true?

12:02.660 --> 12:04.595
No. And even if it were,it'snone of
your damn business.

12:04.630 --> 12:06.530
And it certainly hasnothing to do with
this case.

12:06.565 --> 12:08.800
It does if it's clouding your judgment.

12:09.330 --> 12:11.090
Hey,maybe we should get anattending to
weigh in on this.

12:11.125 --> 12:12.745
- No.- No.

12:12.780 --> 12:14.015
Hey,hey,hey,hey,hey.

12:14.050 --> 12:16.420
Somebody want to tell mewhat the hell's
goin  on here?

12:16.950 --> 12:19.245
Oh,so everything's just all good
now,huh?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.860
Well,somebody better havea good
explanation. Ray?

12:22.870 --> 12:25.740
Okay. 13-year-old drovea snowmobile
into a fence.

12:25.775 --> 12:27.762
Normal CT,stable crit and B.P.

12:27.797 --> 12:29.715
Gates wanted a surgical consult,

12:29.750 --> 12:32.830
I said we didn't need one, but
hedecided to call Neela down here
anyway.

12:32.865 --> 12:34.235
Better safe than sorry,right?

12:34.270 --> 12:36.250
Wrong.It wasn't your call to make.

12:36.285 --> 12:37.165
Ray's above you.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.870
Now if you have a problem with
yourresident or you disagree with his
judgment,

12:39.905 --> 12:41.217
then you call an attending.

12:41.252 --> 12:42.495
I wanted to present to Kovac.

12:42.530 --> 12:45.010
And I didn't.He was busy with another
trauma anyway.

12:45.045 --> 12:47.490
And now they've taken thehospital's
last surgical bed.

12:47.525 --> 12:49.160
That kid needs 24-hour observation.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.250
You cannot give up the last surgical
bed.

12:51.285 --> 12:52.585
I need to follow serial exams.

12:52.620 --> 12:54.295
- Then do it down -here.- You're
already full up.

12:54.330 --> 12:56.320
Th   send him home and have him come
backin 12 hours for a re-exam.

12:56.355 --> 12:57.375
Exactly.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.065
You know,I'm trying to help you guys
here.

12:59.100 --> 13:02.000
No,you give up your last surgical bedto
this kid and we can get stuck boarding

13:02.035 --> 13:04.190
a real surgical trainwreck down here
for days.

13:04.225 --> 13:05.475
Ray's patient,Ray's call.

13:05.510 --> 13:08.190
Fine. Keep him down here.Less w  k for
me.

13:08.530 --> 13:09.315
Thank you.

13:09.350 --> 13:11.355
Yeah,you better be right.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.740
Thanks for the vote of confidence,boss.

13:16.480 --> 13:17.735
- Luka.- Yeah.

13:17.770 --> 13:20.390
You get a chance to speak withAngela
Gilliam about Edgar Dixon?

13:20.425 --> 13:21.345
Who?

13:21.380 --> 13:22.605
The guy from the church clinic.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.880
Oh,ye  ,she-she said she'd,uh,look into
it.

13:25.915 --> 13:27.605
All right,I'm just a little concerned.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.840
Someone called the medical boardand
they called the church.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.380
Okay,I'll talk to her again.

13:31.415 --> 13:32.930
All right,thanks.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.310
You looking for something?

13:39.345 --> 13:40.592
A patient.

13:40.627 --> 13:41.840
Which one?

13:43.530 --> 13:46.360
Hockey dad,Jim Singer,30.Hockey puck
versus face.

13:46.395 --> 13:47.695
It was a slap shot.

13:47.730 --> 13:49.255
This is his son,Jimmy,Jr.

13:49.290 --> 13:50.745
God,he spit out his teeth.

13:50.780 --> 13:53.220
Okay,Jimmy,we're gonna fix your dad up

13:53.255 --> 13:54.940
and you get to play X- Box,okay?

13:54.975 --> 13:56.790
Margo,can you take Jimmy?

13:56.825 --> 13:57.737
How you doing,sir?

13:57.772 --> 13:58.615
I can't breathe.

13:58.650 --> 14:01.660
Looks like a fractured jaw,
multiplebroken teeth. His pulse ox is
down to 88.

14:01.695 --> 14:04.270
Okay,he needs an airway.Pratt,you want
a piece of this?

14:06.560 --> 14:07.870
sure.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.760
How come they didn't bring Clarke back?

14:22.070 --> 14:24.440
They probably moved him to another
bedto free up the trauma room.

14:24.475 --> 14:26.480
And that can be a good sign,so...

14:28.100 --> 14:30.240
Your stepfather hasn't come by,huh?

14:30.880 --> 14:32.420
No.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.100
Why didn't you  ell him youweren't the
one who was driving?

14:38.290 --> 14:40.380
What's the point?

14:40.550 --> 14:42.685
I don't know,maybe so that...

14:42.720 --> 14:44.820
he knows you didn't do this.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.660
He'd still find a way to blame me.

14:48.310 --> 14:51.440
At least now he can't get mad at
Clarke,too.

14:52.990 --> 14:54.760
You   o are close?

14:54.795 --> 14:57.365
Yeah,I guess.

14:57.400 --> 15:00.090
First,it was kind of wedhaving a little
brother.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.990
But he's cool.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.680
His dad's really stric   on him.

15:10.070 --> 15:13.348
I'm afraid he thinksthat I'm a b
influence.

15:14.900 --> 15:18.840
Sometimes I let   m dothings his father
doesn't.

15:18.875 --> 15:21.110
Like drive the snowmobile?

15:24.900 --> 15:26.970
I'll find out how he's doing,okay?

15:27.650 --> 15:29.205
Thanks.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.085
Forget it,we're nevergoing to see the
cords.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.595
All right,let's bag him up and prep the
neckfor a seldinger crike.

15:33.630 --> 15:36.070
Hey,Abby,what's the statuson the other
snowmobile kid,Clarke Sutton?

15:36.105 --> 15:39.080
CT showed persistentpneumo,Kovac put in
a second tube.

15:39.115 --> 15:40.960
But other   an that he'sgood. Try Exam
Three.

15:40.995 --> 15:42.245
Okay,thanks.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.860
Dr. Pratt,I'd like you to stop by my
officeat 4:00 today if that's possible.

15:45.895 --> 15:47.355
Cricothyroid is right here.

15:47.390 --> 15:49.825
Ye  . Um... did you talk to Dr. Kovac
ye

15:49.860 --> 15:54.120
Yes,we need to have a quick sit-down
withthe hospital lawyers about Edgar
Dixon.

15:54.550 --> 15:56.050
Guide wire.

15:56.630 --> 16:00.060
Yeah,I was just at his funeral today. I
spoketo his wife. She's not pressing
any charges.

16:00.095 --> 16:02.195
She's not the problem,the board is.

16:02.230 --> 16:06.140
They're not too happy Mr. Dixon was
gettinghis medications through his
church.

16:06.175 --> 16:08.045
Medications that you distributed.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.790
Yeah,but... who got theboard involved
in this?

16:10.825 --> 16:13.560
I don't know. 4:00.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.875
- Abby,here's your introducer.- Greg...

16:16.910 --> 16:18.630
Dr. Pratt,we got a hot MI five minutes
out.

16:18.665 --> 16:19.635
Uh,Greg...

16:27.370 --> 16:28.981
<i>Do either of these belong to you?
</i>

16:29.550 --> 16:31.010
He   How'd it go?

16:31.045 --> 16:32.815
Spectacular.

16:32.850 --> 16:35.140
Sarcasm is a poor substitute for wit.

16:35.175 --> 16:37.430
Do you know who said that,young man?

16:37.465 --> 16:38.525
Do I car

16:38.560 --> 16:40.930
Alex,don't be rude.Say you're sorry.

16:40.965 --> 16:42.035
Just relax,okay?

16:42.070 --> 16:44.650
Hey. Don't tell me to relax.

16:45.310 --> 16:47.250
I think it's time we  ent home.

16:47.285 --> 16:49.220
Okay,let's go.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.460
March!

17:01.850 --> 17:03.100
Hey.

17:03.830 --> 17:07.410
So,uh,  nally get things  sort   out
with Neela?

17:07.770 --> 17:09.520
There's nothing to sort ou   man.

17:09.555 --> 17:10.535
You sure?

17:10.569 --> 17:12.900
Because it looks like yougot some
sorting out to do.

17:12.935 --> 17:15.230
Look,man,if you   need myadvice,all you
have to do is...

17:15.265 --> 17:17.474
No,no,no,no.No,I don't need your
advice.

17:17.510 --> 17:19.920
I don't want your advice.I took your
advice,remember?

17:19.954 --> 17:21.790
You know,"Give her some time,Ray. "

17:21.825 --> 17:23.810
"Give her so   s  ce,Ray. "

17:23.845 --> 17:25.325
Yeah,I did that.

17:25.359 --> 17:28.230
In fact,I gave her so much time and so
muchspace, she started seeing somebody
else.

17:28.265 --> 17:30.540
- So thank you  or   the advice,Pratt.-
What? So that's...

17:32.760 --> 17:34.165
Stop acting like a baby.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.960
Why are you even here?Nobody invited
you.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.955
It's time you startedshowing a little
res  ct.

17:40.990 --> 17:43.750
And you need to mind yourown damn
business,bitch.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.015
Don't   u ever talk...

17:46.050 --> 17:48.260
Hey! And don't you ever to  h me.

17:48.950 --> 17:50.760
You ever raise your hand to me

17:50.795 --> 17:52.535
or your mother or any other woman

17:52.570 --> 17:55.250
I'll break every bone inyour sullen
little body.

17:57.660 --> 17:58.740
Grandma's got some game.

17:58.775 --> 17:59.785
Ray...

17:59.820 --> 18:02.089
your snowmobile kid's   t looking too
od.

18:02.235 --> 18:04.523
The one you insisted didn't need su
ery.

18:08.550 --> 18:10.400
Hey,I got  his.

18:14.070 --> 18:15.600
Thanks.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.840
Hey,look,um...

18:21.310 --> 18:22.935
I'm sorry about Alex.

18:22.970 --> 18:25.910
You know,he's not always likethat. He's
had a rough year.

18:25.945 --> 18:28.075
You don't need to apologize for
him,Sam.

18:28.110 --> 18:30.610
- I just don't want you to think
that...   - That he's what?

18:31.020 --> 18:33.150
That h  s a teenager?

18:34.340 --> 18:37.015
Sam,I was a holy terror at his age.

18:37.050 --> 18:40.430
My principal suspended me fromschool
one time   r fighting.

18:40.465 --> 18:42.085
So you know what I did?

18:42.120 --> 18:44.280
I slashed all the tires on his
Corvette.

18:45.150 --> 18:46.925
That is a little delinquent.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.700
Yeah,I was a real piece of work.

18:49.580 --> 18:52.960
My mom raised me by herself,too,Sam,so
I know it's not easy.

18:53.820 --> 18:57.470
We fought every single dayfor probably
ten straight years.

18:57.505 --> 19:00.020
And now we talk at   least once a week.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.395
And we're best friends.

19:02.430 --> 19:05.360
And in time,I'm sureyou and Alex will
be,too.

19:08.660 --> 19:10.055
Hey,have you seen Dr. Pratt?

19:10.090 --> 19:11.880
He's out in the ambulancebay waiting on
a rig.

19:11.915 --> 19:13.215
Thanks.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.430
Hey,Abby,I have a working girlwith a
mandible dislocation.

19:15.465 --> 19:16.535
I've tried everything.

19:16.570 --> 19:18.080
You know any tricks? No pun intended.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.055
Can this wait ten minutes?

19:19.090 --> 19:22.650
No,I've already paged Kovac and
Pratt.She pre-medicated,they're all
tied up.

19:22.685 --> 19:25.600
I've tried everything. It  on't budge.I
gave her 100 of fent.

19:25.635 --> 19:26.925
Add some midazolam.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.785
How'd you do this,big yawn?

19:28.820 --> 19:31.340
From what I gather,it was  an oral
occupational injury

19:31.375 --> 19:33.460
she got while performing a service.

19:33.495 --> 19:36.050
Oh. Okay.

19:36.430 --> 19:37.345
Two milligrams in.

19:37.380 --> 19:39.910
Did you try it from behind?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.600
Oh,you're talking to me?

19:42.635 --> 19:44.032
Relo  ting the mandible.

19:44.067 --> 19:45.395
Oh. No,that's a new o  .

19:45.430 --> 19:48.090
From the back,you've got better
leveragefor downward force.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.890
And you can put your weight into it.

19:49.925 --> 19:50.825
Makes sense.

19:50.860 --> 19:52.570
You also get a better gri

19:52.760 --> 19:54.940
Hey,Tony,got a visitor.

19:55.250 --> 19:56.925
Sarah,what are you doing here?

19:56.960 --> 20:00.540
I went up to your room    I saw your
boxes.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.930
Why didn't you tell me?

20:05.390 --> 20:07.040
I was going to.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.690
You lied to me.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.780
Sarah,this really isn't a good time.Why
don't you guys go in the break room?

20:11.815 --> 20:14.012
Go with Sam and I'll bethere in a few
minutes.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.210
You want to leave,thenleave. I don't
care anymore.

20:16.245 --> 20:17.480
- Sarah.- Want me to get her?

20:17.515 --> 20:19.470
Go ahead,I got this.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.670
You okay?

20:26.770 --> 20:27.990
Sarah,wait.

20:28.025 --> 20:29.065
Hey!

20:29.100 --> 20:30.470
Stop and listen to me.

20:30.505 --> 20:31.245
No!

20:31.280 --> 20:33.710
You can't tell me what to do,  you're
not my dad.

20:33.745 --> 20:36.242
Yes,but I'm your friend.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.740
Friends don't leave.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.940
Damn it,abdomen's rigid with fever.

20:56.975 --> 20:58.625
Crits stable,he's not bleeding.

20:58.660 --> 21:00.420
Could be a bowel perf with peritonitis.

21:00.455 --> 21:02.350
Blood cultures and Zosyn 3.375.

21:02.385 --> 21:03.395
Should I get Gates?

21:03.430 --> 21:05.290
No,no,no. No,I need  urgery down here.

21:05.325 --> 21:06.622
I already called them.

21:06.657 --> 21:07.885
Okay,mix up dopamine.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.060
Dennis,De  is,can you hear me?

21:10.095 --> 21:12.165
I need you to start fighting,okay?

21:12.200 --> 21:15.500
Your brother wants to talk to you.
PageNeela. Tell her I need her down
here,now!

21:17.660 --> 21:19.270
Here you g

21:20.950 --> 21:23.730
"Thank you,Tony. "You're welcome,Sarah.

21:24.090 --> 21:26.430
Hey,come on,you can'tbe mad at me
forever.

21:26.465 --> 21:27.505
Why not?

21:27.540 --> 21:29.910
Because of this...

21:30.090 --> 21:31.105
What are you doing?

21:31.140 --> 21:33.850
My sym  thetic doctor face.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.895
You look stupid.

21:36.930 --> 21:39.615
No? All right,you know what,you're
making me bring out the big guns.

21:39.650 --> 21:43.530
When somebody is really sick and
it'svery fatal I say to them,"Mr.
Smith,

21:43.565 --> 21:45.215
"it's very fatal   you're very sick,

21:45.250 --> 21:47.570
"the tumor's too big"for your very tiny
little head.

21:47.605 --> 21:49.130
"It's fatal. You're not going to live.

21:49.165 --> 21:50.865
Sir,you're going to die!"

21:50.900 --> 21:51.710
- Okay,stop.- Then I give 'em this
face.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.570
Then I go...

21:54.830 --> 21:56.850
Stop. Stop it.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.060
It's not funny.

21:59.950 --> 22:00.815
I'm mad at you.

22:00.850 --> 22:04.250
I know. I'm sorry.I wanted to tell you.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.615
Why do you have to go?

22:06.650 --> 22:08.770
Because it's the right thing.

22:08.805 --> 22:11.070
Is it because of Neela?

22:15.540 --> 22:17.485
You called her?

22:17.520 --> 22:19.110
She was worried about you.

22:19.145 --> 22:20.847
Come on. Come on.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.515
What's happening?

22:22.550 --> 22:23.885
Free air under the diaphragm.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.415
Systolic's only 90 after two liters.

22:25.450 --> 22:27.480
I'll throw in a subclavian,then
straight to the O.R.

22:27.515 --> 22:29.420
He s  med okay.Where's his stepfather?

22:29.455 --> 22:31.085
I sent Dawn to find him.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.320
- Thanks for coming.- It's my job,Ray.

22:33.355 --> 22:35.237
Cordis introducer.

22:35.272 --> 22:37.120
Prime the infuser.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.950
All right.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.275
You have a minute?

22:47.310 --> 22:49.270
Yeah. Why,what's up?

22:49.580 --> 22:52.300
It was me- I called the medicalboard
about Edgar Dixon.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.740
You?

22:55.510 --> 22:56.865
Why the hell would you do that?

22:56.900 --> 22:59.330
Because I heard he was getting hismeds
from some  octor at a church.

22:59.365 --> 23:01.120
I thought it was some unlicensed
crackpot.

23:01.155 --> 23:02.785
Oh,Abby.

23:02.820 --> 23:04.830
I'm really sorry.

23:05.310 --> 23:06.075
It's all right.

23:06.110 --> 23:07.510
I'm sorry,I thought Iwas doing the
right thing.

23:07.545 --> 23:09.285
You were. We both were.

23:09.320 --> 23:12.725
Sometimes you do the right thing an
youstill get shafted.    Don't sweat
it.

23:12.805 --> 23:15.650
Hey,Greg,these detectiveswould like to
talk to you.

23:16.070 --> 23:17.255
About what?

23:17.290 --> 23:19.710
Your involvement with apatient named
Edgar Dixon.

23:19.745 --> 23:21.700
I called Angela. She's on her way down.

23:21.735 --> 23:22.595
All right,thanks.

23:22.630 --> 23:26.050
Dr. Pratt,is there someplacewe could go
talk in private?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.610
Yeah,sure.

23:34.050 --> 23:35.780
Right this way.

23:36.220 --> 23:39.760
Yo,Ab  ,I've been looking for you.That
patient you were asking about?

23:39.795 --> 23:41.787
- Boom,he left a message.-   anks.

23:41.822 --> 23:43.780
Let me g  ss,your friend Eddie again.

23:43.815 --> 23:44.875
What,are you jealous?

23:44.910 --> 23:48.570
No,I just don't understand   why
you'regiving this guy so much
attention.

23:49.080 --> 23:52.960
He's a 60-year-old man with
lungdisease. I'm just trying to help
him out.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.825
Hi.

23:56.860 --> 24:00.110
Hi... Kerry...

24:01.690 --> 24:03.130
Uh,we can talk about this later.

24:03.165 --> 24:05.280
Or not.

24:15.900 --> 24:17.295
Everything all right?

24:17.330 --> 24:20.580
Yeah,just a disagreement about a
patient.

24:23.370 --> 24:25.090
Hmm. Gotcha.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.630
I still can't believe you're leaving.

24:31.665 --> 24:34.777
Yeah,it feels a little weird.

24:34.812 --> 24:37.890
Scary,but,uh,it's exciting.

24:39.630 --> 24:42.430
I'm actually going to miss this place.

24:49.170 --> 24:50.670
- You know...- List  ,I just want to...

24:50.705 --> 24:51.920
- No,no,no...- No,go ahead.

24:51.955 --> 24:53.650
- No...- You go.

24:59.970 --> 25:02.490
I just want to say that Ithink that
you've probably

25:02.820 --> 25:07.705
uh,seen me... at my best,

25:07.740 --> 25:12.590
and um... and at my wo  t.

25:14.400 --> 25:17.300
And even though we didn'talways see eye
to eye,um...

25:19.440 --> 25:21.920
...you helped me go from a  urse

25:21.955 --> 25:24.500
to a med student...

25:24.535 --> 25:27.470
to a doctor...

25:30.800 --> 25:33.720
...to a mom.

25:36.990 --> 25:38.670
I'm the one who's supposed to be upset
here.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.840
I know. Sorry.

25:49.510 --> 25:53.010
You were always thereas a nurse and a
doctor

25:53.045 --> 25:56.510
and most importantly,yo  ve  Iways been
here

25:56.545 --> 25:58.740
as my friend.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.350
Do you think this   ppens    the
guyswhen one of them leaves?

26:15.910 --> 26:18.760
I heard Carter bawledlike a baby when
he left.

26:22.310 --> 26:24.550
I'm going to miss you.

26:26.170 --> 26:28.240
Thank you.

26:31.730 --> 26:34.780
And now it's time for usto take care of
ourselves.

26:35.280 --> 26:37.300
You can still hang out with Tony.

26:37.335 --> 26:38.615
It won't be the same.

26:38.650 --> 26:40.885
No,but it will still be good.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.070
You can go to Tony's placewhen I get on
your nerves.

26:43.105 --> 26:45.220
Oh,easy,now. I don't wantthe kid living
wit  me.

26:45.255 --> 26:46.960
I can stay at your place sometimes?

26:46.995 --> 26:48.595
If it's okay with your mom.

26:48.630 --> 26:50.915
I'm going to have a swinging bachelor
pad.

26:50.950 --> 26:53.740
I'm going to have abig-screen TV over
the Jacuzzi,

26:53.775 --> 26:56.392
trampoline and a shark tank,the works.

26:56.427 --> 26:59.010
Nothing stays the same forever,Sarah.

26:59.045 --> 27:01.060
It's part of growing up.

27:01.950 --> 27:04.440
Besides,you won't care about mein a few
years anyway.

27:04.475 --> 27:06.930
You're going to run offand marry that
horn dog character

27:06.965 --> 27:08.780
and have six kids and eight cats...

27:08.815 --> 27:10.152
We broke up.

27:10.187 --> 27:11.455
- What?- Yeah.

27:11.490 --> 27:14.250
Oh,you know,I really never liked that
guy.

27:14.285 --> 27:16.180
It was my fault.

27:16.540 --> 27:18.410
He found out I I like Kevin Mclntyre.

27:18.445 --> 27:20.390
Jezebel.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.350
Better get going,kiddo.

27:29.930 --> 27:31.890
Let Tony get back to work.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.150
Hey...Hey.

27:40.130 --> 27:41.800
Baby girl.

27:56.090 --> 27:58.310
His vitals have stabilized.Let's get
him up to O.R. Two.

27:58.345 --> 28:00.020
I'll call you when   's out of surgery.

28:00.055 --> 28:01.310
Thanks.

28:03.670 --> 28:05.205
Neela.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.305
Neela,I need to say something.

28:07.340 --> 28:09.570
No,you don't. You did what youthought
was right for the patient.

28:09.605 --> 28:10.515
I respect that,Ray.

28:10.550 --> 28:12.760
No,see... no,that's not it.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.620
Then what is it?

28:16.650 --> 28:19.935
Uh... this is probably wrong,I know.

28:19.970 --> 28:22.950
It's the wrong place,thewrong
time,but,uh...

28:24.120 --> 28:26.190
Why didn't somebody page me?

28:26.225 --> 28:27.347
We handled it.

28:27.382 --> 28:28.435
What happened?

28:28.470 --> 28:30.905
Seems like your patienthas a perforated
viscus.

28:30.940 --> 28:33.570
Really? Good thing we didn'tsend him
home,huh,Rock Star?

28:33.605 --> 28:36.160
Looks like h  needed observation after
all.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.925
It's not small bowel
perforation,okay,Tony?

28:38.960 --> 28:40.530
This has nothing to dowith the seat
belt sign.

28:40.565 --> 28:41.475
How do you figure?

28:41.510 --> 28:44.040
Small bowel doesn't seedthe peritoneum
like this.

28:44.075 --> 28:45.255
It's colonic,maybe diverticular.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.670
Really? Interesting. Tell me
more,Doctor.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.780
Where are they taking Dennis?

28:53.200 --> 28:55.430
He's going up to surgery,if you really
care.

28:55.465 --> 28:56.365
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

28:56.400 --> 28:58.420
You know,I sent a nurseto find you 30
minutes ago.

28:58.455 --> 28:59.285
I was with my son.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.970
Yeah? Well,this one needed you,too.

29:01.005 --> 29:02.585
You know what,actually I'm sorry.

29:02.620 --> 29:04.500
He needed a parent. Maybe Ishould have
called his mother.

29:04.535 --> 29:05.995
Hey,y    e gut    line.

29:06.030 --> 29:08.810
ithe  one    them   would even
be(inhere   if Denni  wasn't scre  ng
aro

29:08.845 --> 29:11.390
T/          Denn   w  n't  en   iving.
Clark  was.

29:11.425 --> 29:13.075
- That's nkt true.- Ye   it is.

29:13.110 --> 29:16.440
But did you even   ther to ask
him?No,you just blamed him from the
get-go.

29:16.475 --> 29:17.687
Why didn't he say something?

29:17.722 --> 29:18.865
Would you have   believed h  ?

29:18.900 --> 29:21.520
He was trying toprotect his little
brother.

29:21.555 --> 29:24.140
Dennis is older. Heshould have known
better.

29:24.175 --> 29:26.420
He's 15.

29:27.220 --> 29:31.370
Do you know that he carried
Clarkealmost   mile to the road to get
help?

29:31.580 --> 29:33.415
So instead of busting his balls,

29:33.450 --> 29:36.760
maybe you should be thanking him.He
probably saved your son's life.

29:36.795 --> 29:39.185
Hey,you know,I don'tthink I like your
attitude.

29:39.220 --> 29:41.110
Really? I   n't thin  I likethe way you
treat your kid.

29:41.145 --> 29:43.530
ere do you get offtalking to me like
this?

29:43.565 --> 29:45.545
Where's your supervisor?

29:45.580 --> 29:48.230
You don't know a damnthing about me or
my family.

29:48.265 --> 29:49.715
No,no,no,that's wrong.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.370
'Cause I know that Dennis is a good
kid,

29:51.405 --> 29:53.395
and I know that you are an asshole.

29:53.430 --> 29:55.910
Yeah,and if I were you,I'd
probablystart to treat him a little
better.

29:55.945 --> 29:58.437
Because in a couple years he'sprobably
going to be bigger than you,

29:58.472 --> 30:00.930
and he is going to rememberevery single
time you treated him like crap,

30:00.965 --> 30:04.790
and one day he is goingto kick your
ass,okay?

30:08.180 --> 30:10.480
You got a valid medical license,Dr.
Pratt?

30:10.515 --> 30:11.355
Of course.

30:11.390 --> 30:12.605
What about a pharmacist   lic  se?

30:12.640 --> 30:14.820
My medical license allowsme to write
prescriptions.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.555
Write,yeah,

30:16.590 --> 30:20.560
but diverting controlled substances to
anunauthorized distributor that's a
felony.

30:20.595 --> 30:23.580
I wasn't diverting anything,Iwas
treating patients.

30:23.615 --> 30:25.360
At this illegal clinic of yours?

30:25.395 --> 30:26.705
Illegal clinic?

30:26.740 --> 30:29.540
All right,come on,fellas,let's no  get
carried away here,okay?

30:29.575 --> 30:32.340
Look,I was helping out at a churchwhere
most of the congregation

30:32.375 --> 30:33.940
doesn't even have health insurance.

30:33.975 --> 30:36.040
Like the man that you killed?

30:36.720 --> 30:38.790
Isn't one of you supposedto be the good
cop?

30:39.910 --> 30:41.165
Ray.

30:41.200 --> 30:45.990
Look,Dr. Weaver,I just spent the whole
day withthis great kid who saved his
little brother's life,

30:46.025 --> 30:50.780
and when his stepfather came in and
started toberate and belittle him in
front of everyone,I just...

30:51.890 --> 30:53.780
I don't know,I guess he just reminded
meof someone I used to know.

30:53.815 --> 30:56.000
Yeah,I was just coming to say good-bye.

30:58.530 --> 31:01.930
I may have done a great disserviceto
the world of rock keeping you here,

31:01.965 --> 31:04.780
but you could be a great doctor,Ray.

31:04.815 --> 31:07.072
I kind of thought I was.

31:07.107 --> 31:09.330
I'm kidding.  rt of. Um...

31:11.460 --> 31:13.320
Wow,um...

31:13.840 --> 31:16.900
Thank you,Dr. Weaver.Thank you for
everything.

31:17.970 --> 31:21.510
So what do we do now?Um,hug,kiss?

31:22.150 --> 31:22.905
All right.

31:22.940 --> 31:25.530
So what's next,you guys gonnabeat me
with a rubber hose?

31:25.830 --> 31:27.140
What the hell is going on?

31:27.175 --> 31:28.450
Dr. Pratt is under arrest.

31:28.485 --> 31:29.275
On what charges?

31:29.310 --> 31:31.490
Violation of the Controlled Substance
Act.

31:31.525 --> 31:32.652
Do you believe these jokers?

31:32.687 --> 31:33.888
You had to handcuff him?

31:33.923 --> 31:35.055
It's a felony charge,Doc.

31:35.090 --> 31:36.280
Aw,come on,guys,you can't do this.

31:36.315 --> 31:37.695
Back off,Doc.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.670
Unless you want to go with him.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.960
She's playing with thebunnies,I'm
looking for my camera...

31:50.995 --> 31:55.005
d then,suddenly,we hearthis God-awful
scream,

31:55.040 --> 31:59.270
and we see this billy goathas Sammy by
the pigtails.

32:00.700 --> 32:02.880
Speak of the devil!

32:04.230 --> 32:06.020
Gracie invited me to dinner.

32:06.055 --> 32:07.540
She did?

32:08.570 --> 32:09.680
Hi,Mr. Owens.

32:09.715 --> 32:10.755
Evening,Sam.

32:10.790 --> 32:12.860
Don't worry. I'm not staying for
dinner.

32:12.895 --> 32:14.260
Thanks for the dessert,Gracie.

32:14.295 --> 32:16.435
Anytime,Bennet.

32:16.470 --> 32:18.940
I baked a blueberry pie.I'm making fish
and chips.

32:18.975 --> 32:19.905
Night,Sam.

32:19.940 --> 32:21.610
Hey,you need a hand   thanything,Mr.
Owens?

32:21.645 --> 32:23.820
No. I'm good,thanks.

32:24.740 --> 32:29.110
I... I was just telling the boys about
howthe goat ate your pigtails at the
petting  oo.

32:29.145 --> 32:31.545
Great. Where's Alex?

32:31.580 --> 32:34.260
He's in his room. He's doing his
homework.

32:34.295 --> 32:37.000
At least he better be.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.400
Nice shot.

32:49.030 --> 32:50.375
Hey,what are you doing here?

32:50.410 --> 32:52.240
Why didn't you  ome back   to the
hospital?

32:53.040 --> 32:54.840
How did you find me?

32:55.270 --> 32:57.000
Guy at your hotel said you might be
here.

32:57.035 --> 32:58.375
And,in case you're interested,

32:58.410 --> 33:01.200
your test results show that yourlungs
aren't expanding properly.

33:01.235 --> 33:03.320
They've become fibrotic.

33:03.960 --> 33:06.770
Guess I'll have to switch to menthols.

33:08.850 --> 33:10.750
You didn't have to come here.

33:12.010 --> 33:13.195
Eight ball,corner pocket.

33:13.230 --> 33:15.425
You're not getting enoughoxygen in your
blood.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.780
You're going to need an
echocardiogramto check your cardiac
function.

33:18.815 --> 33:20.960
tter luck next time,chief.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.760
You need to be referred to a
specialist.

33:29.330 --> 33:30.595
No more doctor stuff,huh?

33:30.630 --> 33:33.139
Well,we need to find outwhat's causin
this,Eddie.

33:34.050 --> 33:36.325
No,we don't. Abby,listen...

33:36.360 --> 33:39.980
I don't understand why you got the
tests ifyou weren't planning on
following through.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.020
I don't care about my damn lungs.

33:43.400 --> 33:46.230
I didn't keep coming tosee you for
health reasons.

33:47.490 --> 33:50.440
Okay. Well,th  ,talk tome. What's going
on,huh?

33:54.660 --> 33:57.320
I been taking care of myself my whole
life,

33:57.990 --> 34:00.430
usually at the expense of others.

34:04.740 --> 34:07.970
I appreciate your concern,

34:08.005 --> 34:11.199
but I don't deserve it.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.900
You know,I...    I shouldn't have come
here.

34:29.150 --> 34:29.885
Abby?

34:29.920 --> 34:31.239
Look,just stay away from me. Okay?

34:31.275 --> 34:32.212
Let me explain something.

34:32.246 --> 34:33.114
No,you don't... Don't.

34:33.150 --> 34:34.699
You don't have to. It'sjust a
mistake,all right?

34:34.735 --> 34:35.885
Abby,I know what you're feeling.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.560
No,I don't think you do,because I don't
know what I'm feeling.

34:38.594 --> 34:39.989
And you're right. Ididn't need to come
here.

34:40.025 --> 34:41.820
And I shouldn't have come here.

34:41.855 --> 34:43.804
Abby,I lied to you.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.880
I didn't want to scare you off.

34:47.030 --> 34:48.824
My name isn't Jackson.

34:48.860 --> 34:52.239
It's Wyczenski. I'm your father.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.895
Yeah. I talked to Maggie a while back.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.835
- Probably going on three years.- No.
No.

34:57.870 --> 35:00.620
Yeah. I got caught up onyou and your
brother,Eric,

35:00.940 --> 35:02.672
- fore she started screaming at me.- No
no...

35:02.745 --> 35:03.955
This is not happening.

35:03.990 --> 35:07.260
Yeah,it is. She told me you wereworking
at the hospital here in Chicago.

35:07.295 --> 35:09.280
You know,why are you doing this?

35:09.680 --> 35:11.240
I wanted to see for myself.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.425
After 30 years?

35:12.460 --> 35:16.570
Yeah. I wanted to see what sortof a
person you grew up to be.

35:16.605 --> 35:18.715
- Oh,God! I can't do this.- Took me two
years

35:18.750 --> 35:20.550
- to work up the nerve to come and
visit you.- I cannot do this!

35:20.610 --> 35:23.240
One of the nurses atthe triage desk,she
pointed you out to me,

35:23.275 --> 35:25.535
- and I got cold feet.- Taxi!

35:25.570 --> 35:27.205
You know,if you hadn't walked into the
bar,

35:27.240 --> 35:31.690
I... I probably would have leftwithout
ever speaking to you.

35:32.990 --> 35:35.155
But when I met you,I wanted to know
more,

35:35.190 --> 35:38.520
but I didn't have thegut to tell you
the truth,

35:38.555 --> 35:40.007
because I thought you'd tell me to go
away.

35:40.042 --> 35:41.460
Well,guess what. You were right. Go
away!

35:41.495 --> 35:43.620
- Go away.- Oh,Abby...

35:45.640 --> 35:47.180
Abby,please.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.815
No. Just leave me alon   All right?

35:50.850 --> 35:52.840
You don't get to do this. It's not
fair.

36:04.770 --> 36:06.280
Hey,Kerry!

36:08.170 --> 36:09.105
Hey.

36:09.140 --> 36:11.270
Hey. I didn't get a chanceto say
good-bye to Pratt.

36:11.305 --> 36:13.400
I'm on my way to the policestation to
bail him out.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.970
That's one of those parts of the
jobthey never tell you about.

36:17.005 --> 36:19.930
One of the many partsthat I'm not going
to miss.

36:19.965 --> 36:22.010
Look,hey,I never had a chance to tell
you...

36:22.045 --> 36:23.545
Luka,Luka,you know what?

36:23.580 --> 36:26.285
I'm done talking about th  . Really.
Please?

36:26.320 --> 36:28.990
I... I know...but,hey,you... you hired
me.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.815
I still remember my first day.

36:31.850 --> 36:35.245
An oxygen tankrocketed through the
E.R.- almost killed me.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.640
Well,no one ever said thiswas the
safest place to work.

36:41.630 --> 36:45.050
You... you changed mylife by giving me
this job.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.890
You may even have saved it.

36:52.200 --> 36:58.140
I don't know where I'd beif   hadn't
found this place.

37:01.570 --> 37:03.910
And you taught me a lot.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.630
Thank you.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.810
Come here,you big Croat...

37:20.870 --> 37:22.325
You know what? Don't get up...

37:22.360 --> 37:26.140
Don't get caught up inthe politics,all
right?

37:26.175 --> 37:29.920
A good hospital is aboutpeople and
medicine.

37:34.380 --> 37:35.780
Thank you.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.380
I'll see y   around sometime.

37:41.415 --> 37:43.400
Yeah.

37:50.940 --> 37:52.980
Luka...

37:53.700 --> 37:56.230
Take care of this place for me.

37:57.340 --> 38:00.100
I will.

38:09.660 --> 38:12.010
*******

38:33.110 --> 38:35.090
It's getting late,so I'd better get
going.

38:35.640 --> 38:36.835
But we don't   even work tomorrow.

38:36.870 --> 38:41.195
Yeah,but I'm like Gracie.And I need my
beauty sleep.

38:41.230 --> 38:45.520
Well... you could sleephere tonight if
you want.

38:45.980 --> 38:48.715
It would save you all that driving.

38:48.750 --> 38:52.950
Yeah,but you have that ruleagainst
workplace fraternization.

38:52.985 --> 38:58.107
It's actually more ofa guideline than a
rule.

38:58.142 --> 39:03.230
And it applies moreto doctors than
nurses.

39:05.050 --> 39:06.770
Hmm. That's good to know.

39:11.230 --> 39:13.790
And Alex and Gracie would be okay with
this?

39:17.480 --> 39:18.970
Come on.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.315
Here's a two bedroom onLakeshore with a
concierge.

39:52.350 --> 39:54.670

concierge

40:04.410 --> 40:06.705

40:06.740 --> 40:09.510
You like that one? Is that a funny one?

40:10.100 --> 40:11.890
Hold that thought.

40:13.560 --> 40:17.480
