00:44.345 --> 00:46.780

WOMEN AS VICTIMS.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.449
YOU TURN YOUR BACK--

WE WANT TO AVOID
CIVILIAN CAUSALITIES.

01:14.675 --> 01:18.379
- CAPTAIN, IF I'M SHOOTING,
I'M EMPTYING THE WHOLE GAT.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.616

HICKOK HERE, HOW'D WE DO?

02:04.225 --> 02:06.594
I CALLED, BUT--
- HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.162
- I MADE A KEY
LAST TIME I WAS HERE.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.331
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.800
- IT'S 10 P.M.
WHY DO YOU HAVE SUNGLASSES ON?

02:12.833 --> 02:15.769
- [sighs]

02:17.238 --> 02:20.908
- OH, NO.
IS IT JEFF?

02:20.941 --> 02:23.211
HE HIT YOU? I--

02:23.244 --> 02:26.580
- ALL RIGHT, JUST STOP BEING
A COP FOR A SECOND, OKAY?

02:26.614 --> 02:29.450
I GOT GOOD NEWS.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.185
I'M PREGNANT.

02:31.219 --> 02:34.288
YOU'RE GONNA BE AN AUNT.

03:31.479 --> 03:34.014
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE DONE
WITH HIM.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.884
- WELL, I WAS,
UNTIL THANKSGIVING.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.486
- DOES HE KNOW
ABOUT THE BABY?

03:38.519 --> 03:41.955
- YES.
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT ME.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.925
HE JUST LOST HIS TEMPER.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.560
- AND DOES JEFF
KNOW YOU'RE IN NEW YORK?

03:46.594 --> 03:48.562
- YEAH.

03:48.596 --> 03:54.001
I TOLD HIM IT WAS OVER, BUT I
THINK HE'S ON HIS WAY HERE.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.036
HE WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.373
- HE'LL LISTEN TO ME.

03:59.407 --> 04:02.910
GET SOME SLEEP.
I'LL TAKE THE COUCH.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.546
- I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU,
AMANDA.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.749
- HMPH.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.284
- I COVERED FOR YOU.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.820
- SORRY.
MY SISTER'S BACK IN TOWN.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.622
- WHAT'S HER PROBLEM NOW?

04:14.655 --> 04:19.026
- SHE'S PREGNANT,
AND JEFF'S THE FATHER.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.596
HER ABUSIVE EX.
SHE BROKE IT OFF WITH HIM,

04:22.630 --> 04:24.998
BUT I GUESS HE FOLLOWED HER
UP HERE, SO--

04:25.032 --> 04:27.735
- LOOK, IF HE'S STALKING HER,
GET A TEMP ORDER.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.303
- SHE KNOW WHERE HE IS?
- SHE COULD FIND OUT.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.438
- WE'LL GO TALK TO HIM,
MAN TO MAN.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.039
- NO, NO,

04:32.072 --> 04:34.308
Y'ALL DON'T NEED TO GET DRAGGED
INTO MY FAMILY BUSINESS.

04:49.757 --> 04:53.961

KIM'S NOT COMING TO MEET YOU.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.798
- AMANDA
PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.433
SHE'S CRAZY.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.969
- KIM'S MOVED ON.
SO SHOULD YOU.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.637
- YOU GUYS
GOT IT ALL WRONG.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.373
SHE--SHE CALLED ME,
ALL RIGHT?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.974
SHE SAID SHE MISSED ME.
ASKED ME TO COME UP.

05:07.007 --> 05:10.110
- WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER YOU
GAVE HER A BLACK EYE?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.846
LISTEN,
YOU TOUCH HER AGAIN,

05:12.880 --> 05:15.983
WE SEND YOU BACK TO GEORGIA
WITH YOUR ASS IN A SLING.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.496
- SO THEY LET YOU TAKE A LONG
LUNCH WHENEVER YOU WANT?

05:28.529 --> 05:30.097
MUST BE NICE,
BEING A DETECTIVE.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.899
- YOU KNOW,
JUST A HEADS UP.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.967
NICK AND FIN TALKED TO JEFF,
UNOFFICIAL WARNING.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.103
- THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO
DO THAT.

05:36.136 --> 05:41.575
[laughs]
LOOK, THEY'RE SO LITTLE.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.011
- YOU WANT A BOY OR A GIRL?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.846
DID THE DOCTOR TELL YOU YET?

05:45.879 --> 05:48.716
- I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T
REALLY WANT TO KNOW.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.084
IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING,
HAVING A BABY.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.388
- IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY,
ON YOUR OWN.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.790
- I'LL HAVE YOU, RIGHT?

05:56.824 --> 05:59.860
- HEY, I GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY TO YOU!

05:59.893 --> 06:01.862
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
HOW'D YOU FIND US?

06:01.895 --> 06:03.030
- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
BE FOUND,

06:03.063 --> 06:05.065
THEN DON'T CHECK IN
ON FOURSQUARE.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.934
- THAT WAS JUST A SHOUT OUT
TO MY GIRLS AT THE HUDDLE HOUSE.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.002
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
GET OUT OF HERE, JEFF.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.170
- CAN YOU BUTT OUT, AMANDA?

06:10.203 --> 06:12.105
I NEED TO TALK TO MY FIANCE.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.474
- NO, I TOLD YOU
THAT IS NOT HAPPENING.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.942
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE DONE, JEFF, OKAY?

06:14.975 --> 06:17.077
STAY AWAY FROM HER.
- OR WHAT?

06:17.110 --> 06:19.613
YOU GONNA
PULL YOUR GUN OUT ON ME

06:19.647 --> 06:21.549
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A BABY STORE?

06:21.582 --> 06:24.017
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET ANOTHER WARNING, OKAY?

06:24.051 --> 06:27.955
- THIS AIN'T OVER,
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.102
- ALL RIGHT,
BACK TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.171
"THE RESPONDENT HAS ACTED

06:44.204 --> 06:45.906
IN A WAY I CONSIDER DANGEROUS
OR THREATENING."

06:45.939 --> 06:47.074
- CHECK.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.977
- "THE RESPONDENT
HAS ACCESS TO GUNS."

06:50.010 --> 06:52.546
- AMANDA,
WE'RE FROM GEORGIA.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.448
- YOU THINK HE'D BRING
SOMETHING WITH HIM?

06:54.482 --> 06:57.451
- JEFF KNOWS ALL ABOUT
THE NEW GUN LAWS UP HERE.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.887
HE'S DUMB,
BUT HE'S NOT THAT DUMB.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.525
YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO THAT?

07:04.558 --> 07:08.161
- THE JUDGE'LL WANT PROOF
TO GRANT THE ORDER.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.164
[clicks]

07:11.198 --> 07:14.502
- THIS PETITION INVOLVES
TWO OUT-OF-STATE RESIDENTS?

07:14.535 --> 07:17.204
- BUT MY SISTER IS STAYING
WITH ME NOW, JUDGE.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.740
I MEAN, I'M TAKING
RESPONSIBILITY.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.074
AND MR. PARKER
FOLLOWED HER HERE.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.976
- ALL RIGHT, DETECTIVE.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.845
I'M STILL CONCERNED THAT NONE
OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENTS

07:24.878 --> 07:26.079
TOOK PLACE IN NEW YORK,

07:26.113 --> 07:28.949
BUT YOUR SWORN STATEMENT
DOES CARRY WEIGHT.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.819
- THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

07:31.852 --> 07:35.055
- JUST DON'T SERVE THAT
YOURSELF.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.559
- THANK YOU.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.728
BENSON AND FIN
ARE SERVING THE PAPERS.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.962
- WAIT, RIGHT NOW?

07:41.995 --> 07:43.531
I SHOULD CALL HIM FIRST.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.899
- NO, NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.868
OKAY, KIM, HE GETS WITHIN
SPITTING DISTANCE OF YOU,

07:47.901 --> 07:49.737
HE GETS ARRESTED.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.105
I'LL EXPLAIN HOW
ALL OF IT WORKS LATER, OKAY?

07:52.139 --> 07:53.641
- I THOUGHT
WE COULD HAVE DINNER?

07:53.674 --> 07:56.644
- I'LL ONLY BE A FEW HOURS.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.114
[knock at door]

08:01.148 --> 08:04.918
- JEFF PARKER.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.087
THIS IS A TEMPORARY ORDER
OF PROTECTION.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.089
CONSIDER YOURSELF SERVED.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.891
- [chuckles]
OH, MAN.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.694
IS EVERYONE IN NEW YORK
IN CAHOOTS WITH KIM'S SISTER?

08:13.727 --> 08:16.096
- DON'T VIOLATE THE ORDER.
- ME?

08:16.129 --> 08:19.032
I NEED AN ORDER OF PROTECTION.
AGAINST BOTH OF THEM.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.636
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST QUIT WHILE
YOU'RE BEHIND AND GO HOME?

08:22.670 --> 08:24.738
- AMANDA CAN'T KEEP ME
FROM MY BABY.

08:24.772 --> 08:29.943
- DO YOU WANT US
TO BRING YOU IN RIGHT NOW?

08:29.977 --> 08:32.145
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.654
- HEY, IS--UH,
IS DETECTIVE ROLLINS HERE?

08:40.688 --> 08:43.256
- YOU MUST BE HER SISTER.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.559

08:45.593 --> 08:47.027
YOU MUST BE NICK.
- YEAH.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.762
SHE DID NOT TELL ME
HOW CUTE YOU ARE.

08:48.796 --> 08:51.131
- GOOD TO MEET YOU, KIM.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.233
- UH, AMANDA TOLD ME
SHE'D BE HERE.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.870
- UH, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE NOT SEEN HER.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.171
HAVE YOU TRIED HER CELL?

08:58.205 --> 08:59.973
- YEAH,
I LEFT HER A MESSAGE.

09:00.007 --> 09:03.243
BUT, UM, IS IT OKAY
IF I JUST WAIT FOR HER HERE?

09:03.276 --> 09:06.313
- YEAH, SURE.
JUST--

09:06.346 --> 09:10.684
- ACTUALLY, UM, Y'ALL DON'T
GOT ANY CHANGE DO YOU?

09:10.718 --> 09:14.021
ALL MY SINGLES ARE CRUMPLED.
FOR THE VENDING MACHINE?

09:14.054 --> 09:18.125
I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE
TO EAT ANYTHING TODAY.

09:20.728 --> 09:24.998
- YOU KNOW, LET'S GET YOU
A REAL MEAL, HMM?

09:25.032 --> 09:29.770
DO YOU LIKE CHINESE?
- YEAH, I LOVE IT.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.706
- I HEAR WHAT YOU ALL ARE
SAYING ABOUT TRIGGERS,

09:32.740 --> 09:35.075
'CAUSE MY SISTER

09:35.108 --> 09:37.110
PUSHES ALL OF MY BUTTONS.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.246
SHE DOESN'T WORRY
ABOUT ANYTHING.

09:39.279 --> 09:43.651
SO I WORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.089
- SO AMANDA WALKS IN--
SHE'S NOT EVEN TEN YEARS OLD--

09:49.122 --> 09:51.091
SHE PICKS UP A SQUIRREL GUN
AND SAYS,

09:51.124 --> 09:53.326
"YOU TOUCH MY MAMA AGAIN,
I'LL BLOW YOUR KNEECAPS OFF."

09:53.360 --> 09:55.696
[both laugh]

09:55.729 --> 09:57.798
- SHE HASN'T REALLY CHANGED.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.033
- MM-MMM.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.737
- YOU TWO HAD IT TOUGH
GROWING UP.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.907
- YEAH, WELL,
AT LEAST IT WASN'T BORING.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.642

10:08.676 --> 10:10.678
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:10.711 --> 10:11.779
SORRY, NICK.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.113
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.917
WE'RE HAVING A NICE TIME.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.652
- I DON'T DO SO WELL,

10:18.686 --> 10:20.754
SITTING ALONE
IN YOUR APARTMENT, REMEMBER?

10:20.788 --> 10:23.023
- OUR PIZZA DELIVERY RAPIST
STRUCK AGAIN.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.958
HE SWITCHED
TO THE WEST SIDE.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.727
OUR VIC IS
ON HER WAY TO ST. LUKE'S.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.996
WHO'S UP?

10:29.029 --> 10:31.431

I'M--I'M GOOD TO GO.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.211
YOUR SISTER GETS A LIFT
TO YOUR PLACE.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.047
- THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.216
AMANDA TOLD ME HOW
YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT HER BACK.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.193
- QUIET!

11:00.227 --> 11:01.261

TELL HER, KIM!

11:13.140 --> 11:14.074
- NO, I DIDN'T!
- GET YOUR HANDS UP!

11:15.843 --> 11:18.846
[gunshots]
[Kim screams, Jeff groans]

11:35.095 --> 11:36.363
- HE HAD A GUN.
SHE WAS SCREAMING.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.098
IT WAS A GOOD SHOOT.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.232
- SO DON'T MAKE
YOUR FIRST MISTAKE

11:39.266 --> 11:41.001
BY ANSWERING QUESTIONS.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.435
- I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT I TOLD THE CAPTAIN.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.938
YOU SPEAK TO NO ONE BUT
YOUR DELEGATE OR A LAWYER.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.774
- CAPTAIN CRAGEN?
I'M CAPTAIN REECE.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.308
SHE ONE OF YOURS?

11:48.341 --> 11:49.943
- DETECTIVE AMANDA ROLLINS,
YES.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.111
- AND SHE WON'T ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS

11:51.144 --> 11:52.412
UNLESS SHE HAS A DELEGATE.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.983
- SHE'S RIGHT.
GET HER A DELEGATE.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.851
AND IF SHE SAYS ANYTHING,
MIRANDIZE HER.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.286
MAKE IT STICK.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.221
- LIEUTENANT TUCKER,
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

12:01.254 --> 12:04.257
- OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING,
HER SECOND IN A YEAR.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.960
ROUTINE.
I SEE YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.195
- SAVE IT.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.130
- WHAT DO WE HAVE?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.999
- DETECTIVE ROLLINS
WALKS IN,

12:12.032 --> 12:14.067
SEES HER SISTER BEING SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED BY THE DECEASED.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.136
ASSAILANT HAD A GUN.
SISTER CONFIRMS.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.205
- WE KNOW HOW HE GOT IN THE
APARTMENT? HE BREAK THE CHAIN?

12:18.238 --> 12:21.074
- NO, THAT WAS ME.
- OH, YOU KNEW HE HAD A GUN.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.409
- NOW IS NOT THE TIME,
LIEUTENANT.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.778
- I'LL NEED HER
FOR QUESTIONING.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.379
- AFTER SHE GETS
CHECKED OUT.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.448
- OKAY, BUT KIM NEEDS AN EXAM.
SHE'S PREGNANT.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.251
- CAPTAIN REECE WILL SEE
THAT SHE GETS THERE.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.820
- AMANDA, LET'S GO.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.561
- DETECTIVE ROLLINS, I'M YOUR
DELEGATE, DIDI DENZLER.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.332
THEY'LL DO A COMPLETE TOX SCREEN
AND BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL,

12:45.365 --> 12:46.967
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH--

12:47.000 --> 12:51.204
- THERE'S NOT.

12:51.238 --> 12:54.207
- YOU SHOULD ALSO TALK TO THE
DEPARTMENT PSYCHOLOGIST ASAP.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.276
- YOU'RE MAKING WAY MORE
OUT OF THIS THAN--

12:56.309 --> 12:58.278
THAN WHAT IT IS.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.547
HE WAS RAPING MY SISTER.
I MEAN, HE HAD A GUN.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.116
- AND HE'S ALSO
THE FATHER OF HER BABY,

13:03.150 --> 13:05.185
AND A YEAR FROM NOW
AT CHRISTMAS,

13:05.218 --> 13:06.854
SHE MAY NOT FEEL
THE SAME WAY.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.289
- I DON'T GO HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS.

13:11.258 --> 13:15.462
- LIKE I SAID, PSYCHOLOGIST,
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.203
- SHE KILLED
HER SISTER'S BOYFRIEND?

13:23.236 --> 13:25.105
- [sighs]
- HOW'S SHE DOING?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.274
- WELL, YOU KNOW, AMANDA.
SHE'S BY THE BOOK.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.309
SHE'S NOT LOSING
ANY SLEEP OVER IT.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.178
- HASN'T SUNK IN YET.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.313
- HER SISTER IS PREGNANT.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.950
THE EX,
HE WAS THE FATHER?

13:36.984 --> 13:39.552
- ROLLINS?

13:39.586 --> 13:41.855
- OH, HEY.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.491
- HEY, NICK.
YOU CAME BY TO SEE ME?

13:44.524 --> 13:46.326
THAT'S SO SWEET.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.229
- ACTUALLY, I WAS
LOOKING FOR AMANDA.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.866
- OH, THAT'S THE STORY
OF MY LIFE.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.302
- ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.304
- YOU MEAN,
BESIDES BEING PREGNANT

13:57.337 --> 13:59.439
WITH MY BABY DADDY'S BLOOD
ALL OVER ME?

13:59.472 --> 14:01.875
SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE ME
DO A RAPE KIT,

14:01.909 --> 14:03.643
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
HURT THE BABY.

14:03.676 --> 14:07.080
- I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT IT COULD HELP YOUR SISTER

14:07.114 --> 14:09.182
IF WE HAD EVIDENCE
OF THE ASSAULT.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.151
- OF COURSE.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.887
IT'S JUST, HE WASN'T
REALLY RAPING ME, YOU KNOW?

14:13.921 --> 14:16.356
I MEAN, HE TRIED,

14:16.389 --> 14:18.491
BUT HE--
HE DIDN'T, YOU KNOW--

14:18.525 --> 14:21.461
- KIM, YOU SHOULD LET THEM
DOCUMENT ANY INJURIES,

14:21.494 --> 14:23.263
FOR YOUR SISTER'S SAKE.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.333
- AMANDA'S GONNA BE FINE.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.870
AMANDA IS ALWAYS FINE.

14:34.241 --> 14:37.077
- YOU'RE STILL COMING DOWN
OFF AN ADRENALINE RUSH.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.980
AND WHEN YOU DO, YOU MAY HAVE
SOME TROUBLE SLEEPING.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.015
- I WON'T.

14:42.049 --> 14:45.685
AND I WON'T BE DEPRESSED,
SECOND-GUESS MY ACTIONS,

14:45.718 --> 14:47.520
OR WONDER WHAT KIND OF LIFE

14:47.554 --> 14:49.189
THAT GUY WOULD'VE HAD
IF HAD LIVED.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.225
- DETECTIVE, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE,

14:52.259 --> 14:53.226
BUT THIS SESSION IS--

14:53.260 --> 14:54.694
- IS TO MAKE SURE

14:54.727 --> 14:56.930
THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS COVERED
IF I EAT MY GUN.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.066
I WON'T.
- OKAY.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.268
WHAT YOU JUST SAID,

15:01.301 --> 15:02.402
I THINK WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT IT.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.938
HAVE YOU HAD
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS?

15:04.972 --> 15:06.373
- NO, I'M ANNOYED.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.108
- ANNOYED?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.977
- YEAH, THE GUY I SHOT
HAD IT COMING.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.278
YOU KNOW,
MY SISTER DIDN'T HELP.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.279
SHE INVITES DRAMA
INTO HER LIFE

15:12.312 --> 15:13.346
AND SHE DRAGS ME INTO IT,

15:13.380 --> 15:15.382
SO "ANNOYED"
PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT UP.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.619
- SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'VE
CLEANED UP HER MESSES BEFORE?

15:19.652 --> 15:23.223
IT'S HER FAULT.
- NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.226
BUT IT'S NOT MINE.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.062
- WHAT ELSE ARE YOU FEELING?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.231
- I JUST WANT
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.266
- BUT YOU KNOW
THAT DEPARTMENT POLICY

15:33.300 --> 15:34.701
WON'T ALLOW ACTIVE DUTY

15:34.734 --> 15:36.636
UNTIL AFTER THIS INVESTIGATION
IS CLOSED.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.571
- BUT I PASSED MY PSYCH.

15:38.605 --> 15:42.075
- I CAN STATE THAT YOUR REACTION
TO THE SITUATION

15:42.109 --> 15:43.510
IS WELL WITHIN THE NORM,

15:43.543 --> 15:45.278
BUT WE SHOULD HAVE
A FOLLOW-UP SESSION.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.048
- YEAH,
WHATEVER I NEED TO DO.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.282
- GOOD.

15:49.316 --> 15:53.186
IN THE MEANTIME,
CALL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY ANXIETY

15:53.220 --> 15:54.521
OR TROUBLE SLEEPING.

15:54.554 --> 15:58.325
- I'LL SLEEP
WHEN I GET MY GUN BACK.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.497
- JEFF'S GUN WAS
AN M-19-11 .45

16:04.531 --> 16:05.999
SOLD THROUGH THE INTERNET

16:06.033 --> 16:07.367
AND SENT TO HIS ADDRESS
TWO YEARS AGO.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.069
ONE OF SIX GUNS
HE BOUGHT THAT WAY.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.371
AND AS PER GEORGIA LAW,
UNREGISTERED,

16:11.404 --> 16:13.440
BUT COMPLETELY LEGAL.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.342
- NEIGHBORS CONFIRM
THE REST OF THE STORY.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.277
KIM SCREAMS.
THE DOOR IS KICKED IN.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.212
DOUBLE TAP.
JEFF'S DEAD.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.313
- IT'S NOT GONNA
STOP TUCKER

16:20.347 --> 16:21.648
FROM TRYING TO
TAKE HER BADGE AWAY.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.316
- BUT HOW?
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.185
- NICK, WE GOT A LOT OF HISTORY
WITH THIS GUY.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.754
- HISTORY? HE TRIED TO
TAKE MY BADGE AWAY.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.157
WE'RE NOT BEING
PARANOID HERE, NICK.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.193
THIS GUY HAS IT IN FOR US.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.300
- WELL, I WAS ASLEEP
AND I HEARD A KNOCK,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.569
AND I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS AMANDA.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.337
- YOU LET HIM IN?

16:44.371 --> 16:47.307
- WELL, I OPENED THE DOOR AND
THEN HE FORCED HIS WAY IN,

16:47.340 --> 16:49.142
YOU KNOW,
YELLING AND SCREAMING

16:49.176 --> 16:53.413
ABOUT HOW HE WAS GONNA TAKE BACK
WHAT WAS HIS, MEANING ME.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.714
- HOW MUCH LONGER
AFTER HE ARRIVED

16:54.747 --> 16:56.249
DID DETECTIVE ROLLINS
GET THERE?

16:56.283 --> 16:58.385
- PRETTY QUICKLY.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.786
YOU KNOW,
I WAS SCREAMING,

16:59.819 --> 17:02.455
AND THEN THE NEXT THING I KNEW,
I HEARD THE SHOTS.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.324
- HOW MANY SHOTS
WERE FIRED?

17:04.357 --> 17:07.560
- I DON'T KNOW.
TWO, THREE.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.196
- DID THE OFFICER
IDENTIFY HERSELF?

17:09.229 --> 17:14.401
- AMANDA? WELL, JEFF--
JEFF KNEW WHO SHE WAS.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.337
- THEY KNEW EACH OTHER?

17:17.370 --> 17:19.072
WHAT WAS THE TENOR
OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP?

17:19.106 --> 17:22.209
- LIEUTENANT,
LET'S STICK TO THE INCIDENT.

17:22.242 --> 17:25.245
AFTER THE SHOTS WERE FIRED,
THEN WHAT?

17:25.278 --> 17:29.316
- UM, AMANDA TOLD ME
NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING

17:29.349 --> 17:30.383
AND TO CALL 911,

17:30.417 --> 17:32.385
AND THEN I THINK
SHE CHECKED ON JEFF.

17:32.419 --> 17:37.257
- I ENTERED AND I SAW JEFF,
THE DECEASED, ON TOP OF HER.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.792
I BELIEVED HE WAS
ATTEMPTING TO RAPE HER.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.761
- AND IT WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH
TO SEE THAT?

17:41.794 --> 17:45.265
- YEAH, SHE WAS STRUGGLING,
SCREAMING.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.499
- GO ON.

17:46.533 --> 17:50.403
- I SAID, "HANDS UP.
GET OFF OF HER."

17:50.437 --> 17:52.572
UM, HE TURNED.

17:52.605 --> 17:56.143
UH, KIM YELLED,
"HE'S GOT A GUN."

17:56.176 --> 17:58.378
I FIRED.
- YOU SAW THE GUN?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.847
- WELL, HE GRABBED IT FROM
THE FLOOR BEHIND HIM.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.282
- BUT DID YOU SEE THE GUN?

18:02.315 --> 18:03.650
- YES.

18:03.683 --> 18:08.488
AND KIM GAVE ME
A WARNING AS WELL.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.857
- WELL, IF BALLISTICS
AND FORENSICS MATCH YOUR STORY,

18:10.890 --> 18:13.826
YOU SHOULD BE FINE HERE.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.295
[door opens]

18:15.328 --> 18:18.465
- WELCOME, LADIES.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.667
- NICE MAN CAVE.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.604
- I'M HOPING THAT CSU WORKS
A LITTLE FASTER THAN NORMAL

18:24.637 --> 18:26.173
AND WE CAN BE
OUT OF YOUR HAIR SOON.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.640
- DON'T EVEN WORRY
ABOUT IT.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.210
YOU GUYS CAN TAKE
KEN'S OLD ROOM DOWN THE HALL.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.246
- MAN, THEY SHOULD PUT YOU UP
IF YOUR PLACE IS A CRIME SCENE.

18:33.280 --> 18:37.150
[cell phone rings]

18:37.184 --> 18:39.219
- LISTEN, IF MY SISTER
GETS TO BE TOO MUCH,

18:39.252 --> 18:40.253
YOU LET ME KNOW.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.588
- SHE'LL BE FINE.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.323
THE QUESTION IS,
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

18:43.356 --> 18:47.427
- THE SOONER THE PAPERWORK'S
DONE, THE BETTER.

18:47.460 --> 18:51.331
- BUT WHAT IF THAT'S
NOT THE WAY IT HAPPENED?

18:51.364 --> 18:55.568
CAN I--
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

18:55.602 --> 18:57.837
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

18:57.870 --> 19:00.940
- YEAH, I'M FINE.
I LIKE IT HERE.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.509
- 'CAUSE I'VE GOT TO
GET BACK,

19:02.542 --> 19:03.843
BUT WE'LL GET SUPPER TONIGHT
WHEN I GET HOME.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.412
- SURE.
- ANYTHING YOU WANT.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.247
- MAYBE CHINESE AGAIN.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.515
- [groans]

19:08.548 --> 19:10.950
- AMANDA.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.586
I LOVE YOU.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.623
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.764
[knocks on door]

19:27.800 --> 19:29.336
- SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
LIEUTENANT.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.571
- IT'S NOT A BOTHER.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.840
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.608
- WELL,
IT'S JUST THAT, UH,

19:35.642 --> 19:37.277
I HATE TO GO
BEHIND AMANDA'S BACK,

19:37.310 --> 19:39.846
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.349
- HAVE A SEAT,
MS. ROLLINS.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.227
- I APPRECIATE YOU COMING IN,
DETECTIVE.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.429
- YOU SAID YOU HAD
A FEW LOOSE ENDS?

19:56.463 --> 19:59.266
- YEAH.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.401
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH JEFF PARKER.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.336
- OKAY.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.241
- WHEN DID
THE TWO OF YOU MEET?

20:08.275 --> 20:12.445
- UH, MY SISTER
BROUGHT HIM HOME FOR EASTER.

20:12.479 --> 20:15.415
UH, 2010, I-I BELIEVE.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.317
- THAT WAS
IN YOUR HOMETOWN?

20:17.350 --> 20:19.286
- LOGANVILLE, YEAH.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.422
- WHAT'D YOU THINK OF HIM?

20:22.455 --> 20:24.557
WELL,
YOUR GENERAL IMPRESSION.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.925
DID YOU LIKE THE GUY,
DID YOU NOT LIKE THE GUY?

20:25.958 --> 20:27.460
- I DON'T KNOW.

20:27.494 --> 20:28.795
I DIDN'T REALLY
THINK MUCH ABOUT HIM

20:28.828 --> 20:29.796
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.365
- OH, OKAY.

20:32.399 --> 20:36.536
HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM
SIX MONTHS LATER IN ATLANTA?

20:36.569 --> 20:39.406
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.374
- WHEN YOU SLAMMED HIM
AGAINST THE WALL

20:41.408 --> 20:42.809
AND THREATENED TO
ARREST HIM.

20:45.312 --> 20:49.582
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

20:49.616 --> 20:52.985
WELL...

20:53.019 --> 20:56.323
HE HAD BEATEN MY SISTER
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.291
I MEAN, I HAD TO TAKE HER
TO THE E.R.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.659
- SO, YES?

20:59.692 --> 21:01.461
- YES.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.297
- YES, YOU HAVE A HISTORY
OF PHYSICAL FORCE

21:04.331 --> 21:05.798
AND THREATS
WITH THE DECEASED.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.367
- WELL, HE WAS
A DANGER TO KIM.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.369
- OKAY.

21:09.402 --> 21:14.006
NOW FOUR MONTHS AGO,
IN YOUR APARTMENT IN NEW YORK,

21:14.040 --> 21:18.044
YOU PULLED A GUN
ON MR. PARKER.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.513
- HE WAS ATTACKING
MY SISTER.

21:20.547 --> 21:23.015
- DID SHE SAY THAT?
- I SAW IT.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.016
- HOW DID HE GET
IN THE APARTMENT?

21:24.050 --> 21:24.884
- KIM INVITED HIM IN.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.753
- OKAY, SO KNOWING THAT,
YOU STILL SAID,

21:26.786 --> 21:28.488
"IF YOU'RE NOT OUT
THAT DOOR IN 30 SECONDS,

21:28.521 --> 21:30.990
I'LL SHOOT YOU"?

21:31.023 --> 21:32.825
- I MAY HAVE SAID
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

21:32.859 --> 21:36.463
- DID YOU ALSO SAY,
"YOU SHOW UP AGAIN, NO WARNING"?

21:39.466 --> 21:41.501
WAS HE REALLY
ATTACKING YOUR SISTER

21:41.534 --> 21:44.704
OR DID YOU JUST NOT WANT
THIS GUY IN YOUR HOUSE?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.911
- AMANDA.
[clicks TV off]

21:51.944 --> 21:54.681
- NOW WHAT IN THE HELL
DID YOU TELL TUCKER?

21:54.714 --> 21:56.683
- OKAY, JUST LISTEN--

21:56.716 --> 21:57.884
- DID YOU TELL HIM THAT I PULLED
MY GUN ON JEFF LAST YEAR?

21:57.917 --> 21:59.619
- I HAD TO.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.388
- YOU CHANGED YOUR STORY ABOUT
THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.390
YOU SAID JEFF
DIDN'T TRY TO RAPE YOU. WHY?

22:03.423 --> 22:04.591
- I HAD TO MAKE IT SEEM
LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.426
- BUT IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.395
I MEAN, HE WAS RAPING YOU.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.096
- YEAH, HE WAS ABOUT TO,

22:10.129 --> 22:12.432
BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF WE SAID THAT HE WASN'T.

22:12.465 --> 22:15.902
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I COULD LOSE MY BADGE, KIM.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.737
I COULD GO TO PRISON,
OKAY?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.439
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO,

22:19.472 --> 22:21.408
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT RIGHT NOW.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.042
- YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO ME. I CAN'T.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.912
- YEAH, KIM, YOU CAN.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.615
- THEN WE AIN'T GONNA
GET THE MONEY.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.450
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

22:30.483 --> 22:36.389
- WELL, I KIND OF TOOK A LIFE
INSURANCE POLICY OUT ON JEFF.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.758
- KIND OF?

22:38.791 --> 22:42.829
- ACTUALLY, WE BOTH DID.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.797
YOUR NAME'S ON THERE TOO.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.967
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE IT SEEM
LIKE AN ACCIDENT,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.837
NOT WHILE HE WAS COMMITTING
A FELONY, OR ELSE--

22:50.870 --> 22:52.839
THAT CANNOT GO
ON THE POLICE REPORT.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.140
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
- THEY WON'T PAY.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.676
- OH.
GOD.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.946
WHEN--WHEN DID YOU BUY
THIS POLICY?

22:59.979 --> 23:01.147
- TWO MONTHS AGO.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.182
WHEN I FOUND OUT
I WAS PREGNANT.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.951
- I NEED TO SEE
A COPY OF IT.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.953
- I DON'T HAVE ONE.
- GET IT, KIM, NOW.

23:06.986 --> 23:10.089
- OKAY. OKAY.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.659
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A SMART GIRL.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.662
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CAN'T
JUST ROLL WITH THIS.

23:20.032 --> 23:22.869
WE'LL FINALLY BE RICH.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.481
- SO YOUR SISTER FORGED
YOUR NAME ON THE POLICY?

23:34.514 --> 23:36.783
- SHE HAS
IMPULSE CONTROL ISSUES.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.719
SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS
HELPING ME OUT.

23:42.054 --> 23:46.526
- CAN I KEEP THIS?
- YES. IT'S NO GOOD ANYWAY.

23:46.559 --> 23:49.095
- OH, WE'LL BE IN TOUCH WITH
ATLANTA FIDELITY TO VERIFY THAT.

23:49.128 --> 23:52.599
- WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
WITHOUT A LAWYER.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.934
I JUST WANT TO GET
THE TRUTH OUT HERE.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.769
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.672
- MY SISTER WILL CONFIRM THAT
SHE WAS ATTACKED TWO DAYS AGO,

23:59.706 --> 24:02.174
AND SHE WARNED ME
THAT JEFF HAD A GUN.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.544
IT WAS A GOOD SHOOTING.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.013
- SO SHE'LL CHANGE
HER STORY AGAIN?

24:07.046 --> 24:08.247
- LOOK,
I CAME IN RIGHT AWAY

24:08.280 --> 24:09.949
AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE POLICY.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.951
I'VE GOT NOTHING
TO HIDE HERE.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.986
- GOOD.

24:14.020 --> 24:17.624
I'VE GONE OVER YOUR JACKET,
DETECTIVE.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.792
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAD
A GAMBLING PROBLEM?

24:19.826 --> 24:23.229
- I WAS FORTHCOMING ABOUT THAT
WITH MY CAPTAIN.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.998
I TOOK A COMMAND DISCIPLINE
AND TEN VACATION DAYS.

24:26.032 --> 24:29.168
I'VE BEEN IN GAMBLER'S ANONYMOUS
EVER SINCE.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.270
- YOU WERE FORTHCOMING

24:31.303 --> 24:35.542
AFTER THE MAN YOU OWED
THE MONEY TO, CONNOR MURPHY,

24:35.575 --> 24:38.210
SPOKE TO THE D.A.
ABOUT YOU?

24:38.244 --> 24:39.946
- YES.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.214
- AT THAT TIME,
YOU OWED MR. MURPHY

24:42.248 --> 24:46.686
AND HIS ASSOCIATE,
JIMMY MCCOURT, $20,000?

24:46.719 --> 24:50.557
- APPROXIMATEL--YEAH.
YES, THAT IS CORRECT.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.891
- DID YOU PAY THAT DEBT?

24:51.924 --> 24:55.061
- WELL, MCCOURT AND MURPHY
ARE BOTH IN ATTICA.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.163
- SO YOU STILL
OWE THEM THE MONEY?

24:57.196 --> 25:00.166
YOU HAVE GAMBLING ISSUES,
OUTSTANDING DEBT,

25:00.199 --> 25:03.035
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME
THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA

25:03.069 --> 25:05.071
THE MAN YOU SHOT
HAD A POLICY

25:05.104 --> 25:08.708
THAT NAMED YOU
AS A BENEFICIARY?

25:08.741 --> 25:11.611
- I CAME TO YOU,
LIEUTENANT TUCKER.

25:11.644 --> 25:15.281
- YOU MEAN,
AFTER YOUR SISTER DID.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.120
- I'VE LEFT FIVE MESSAGES
FOR MR. GRABER.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.122
WHEN WILL HE BE BACK?

25:23.155 --> 25:24.757
YEAH, IT IS URGENT.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.694
SO HAVE HIM CALL ME
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, PLEASE.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.830
- THIS IS STILL
ABOUT IAB?

25:30.863 --> 25:32.965
AMANDA, DON'T FOOL WITH THEM.
GET A LAWYER.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.301
- I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG,
AND IF I GET A LAWYER,

25:35.334 --> 25:38.270
THEY'RE JUST GONNA
HANG KIM OUT TO DRY.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.076
[sighs]
I'M HER BIG SISTER.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.345
YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T
HAVE PARENTS THAT REALLY,

25:46.378 --> 25:48.147
UM, TOOK CARE OF US,

25:48.180 --> 25:51.283
SO IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG,
I WAS THE ONE WHO FIXED IT.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.953
- AND SHE NEVER HAD TO GROW UP,
'CAUSE YOU WERE ALWAYS THERE.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.157
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:58.190 --> 26:01.327
- [sighs]
I'M NOT SURE.

26:07.834 --> 26:12.238
- [sighs]

26:12.271 --> 26:14.240
[door opens]

26:14.273 --> 26:16.275
- HEY.
- HEY.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.813
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING.

26:20.847 --> 26:22.915
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

26:22.949 --> 26:25.284
- LET'S TALK ABOUT

26:25.317 --> 26:28.855
THAT LIFE INSURANCE
POLICY.

26:28.888 --> 26:32.091
WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT?

26:32.124 --> 26:36.062
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I LOVE MY SISTER,

26:36.095 --> 26:38.931
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING
THAT'S GONNA HURT HER.

26:38.965 --> 26:42.735
- I UNDERSTAND.

26:42.769 --> 26:47.073
- I'M JUST A LITTLE UNSURE
OF WHAT TO DO HERE.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.743
- JUST TELL THE TRUTH.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.411
CAN YOU DO THAT?

26:52.444 --> 26:54.046
- I WANT TO.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.082
- GOOD.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.217
SO, WAS THAT POLICY YOUR IDEA

26:58.250 --> 27:02.154
OR DETECTIVE ROLLINS'?

27:02.188 --> 27:05.224
- LOOK, I DON'T--I DON'T
WANT HER TO BE MAD AT ME.

27:05.257 --> 27:08.327
I'M ALL ALONE, AND I DON'T--
I DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO STAY.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.030
- JUST TELL THE TRUTH,
MS. ROLLINS,

27:11.063 --> 27:14.834
AND WE WILL TAKE CARE
OF ALL OF THAT.

27:14.867 --> 27:20.206
- CALL ME BACK, KIM,
RIGHT AWAY.

27:20.239 --> 27:23.375
HAVE YOU SEEN MY SISTER?

27:23.409 --> 27:25.044
- UH, NOT SINCE
THE OTHER NIGHT.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.913
- REALLY, BECAUSE THE LAST TIME
I SAW YOU TWO TOGETHER,

27:26.946 --> 27:28.214
YOU SEEMED PRETTY COZY.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.281
- WHOA, HEY--
- HEY, AMANDA.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.183
AMANDA, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

27:31.217 --> 27:33.085
- KIM IS GONE.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.254
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT
ANSWERING HER PHONE.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.156
HER STUFF IS COMPLETELY
CLEARED OUT OF YOUR APARTMENT.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.457
- SHE DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING TO ME.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.259
I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.829
- OKAY. SO, HEY,
HOW CAN WE HELP?

27:42.862 --> 27:45.197
- ROLLINS.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.109
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:59.311 --> 28:02.448
- KIM WENT TO IAB.

28:02.481 --> 28:06.452
SHE BACKED OFF THE DETAILS
OF THE SHOOTING,

28:06.485 --> 28:08.287
THE ATTEMPTED RAPE.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.922
- AND WHY WOULD SHE
DO THAT?

28:09.956 --> 28:14.426
- SHE TOOK OUT A LIFE INSURANCE
POLICY ON JEFF

28:14.460 --> 28:17.964
WITH BOTH OUR NAMES ON IT.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.399
SHE DIDN'T READ THE FINE PRINT,

28:20.432 --> 28:22.301
AND THE CLAIM IS VOID

28:22.334 --> 28:24.436
IF THE DECEASED IS KILLED
WHILE COMMITTING A FELONY.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.272
- DOES IAB KNOW
ABOUT THE POLICY?

28:26.305 --> 28:28.775
- YEAH, I TOLD THEM
AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT.

28:28.808 --> 28:31.077
[knock at door]

28:31.110 --> 28:32.511
- MY NEIGHBOR
SAID THEY SAW KIM

28:32.544 --> 28:34.346
GET INTO
AN UNMARKED POLICE CAR.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.882
- ALL RIGHT,
WELL, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.917
I'M CALLING A LAWYER.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.520
- DETECTIVE ROLLINS,

28:41.553 --> 28:44.323
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR
THE MURDER OF JEFF PARKER.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.429
YOUR CAPTAIN
WILL TAKE YOUR SHIELD.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.874
[handcuffs clinking]

29:06.345 --> 29:09.315
- DO NOT TALK TO ANYBODY
WITHOUT YOUR LAWYER.

29:09.348 --> 29:12.184
NOT THE D.A., NOT IAB,
NOT YOUR SISTER.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.186
IS THAT CLEAR?
- THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.755
LET US DO OUR JOB NOW.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.133
[camera shutter clicks]

29:27.166 --> 29:30.036
- TURN TO YOUR LEFT,
DETECTIVE.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.371
[camera shutter clicks]

29:38.077 --> 29:40.847
- YEAH, HE'S ON HIS WAY.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.883
COPY THAT, FIN.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.953
YEAH, I'M--I'M OKAY.
THANKS.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.102
- CUFFS.

30:14.113 --> 30:16.182
[gate buzzes]

30:18.350 --> 30:20.019
- MA'AM,
YOUR LAWYER'S HERE.

30:23.389 --> 30:26.893
- DETECTIVE ROLLINS,
I'M HESHY HOROWITZ,

30:26.926 --> 30:30.062
THE GUY WHO'S GONNA GET YOU
OUT OF THIS MISHEGOSS.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.098
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.033
- ABSOLUTELY,
COMMISSIONER.

30:34.066 --> 30:37.403
YES, I KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE I STAND.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.438
WE WILL STAY OUT OF
IAB's WAY.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.341
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.

30:42.374 --> 30:45.444
WELL, 1-P-P
HAS COVERED THEIR ASS.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.980
WHERE ARE WE?

30:48.014 --> 30:51.050
THE INSURANCE POLICY. THAT'S
WHAT GAVE IAB PROBABLE CAUSE.

30:51.083 --> 30:54.053
- ATLANTA FIDELITY SAYS
THEY CAN'T TALK TO US.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.956
- ROLLINS TOLD ME HER SIGNATURE
ON THAT POLICY WAS FORGED.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.557
CAN WE VERIFY THAT?

30:58.590 --> 31:02.061
- AMANDA GOT THE POLICY FROM
HER SISTER AND GAVE IT TO IAB.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.063
- I TOLD HER NOT TO GO
IN THERE WITHOUT A LAWYER.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.899
- WE ALL DID.
I MEAN, WE'RE WAY PAST THAT.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.567
- POINT TAKEN.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.236
BUT DOES ANYONE THINK

31:10.269 --> 31:12.171
ROLLINS KNEW
ABOUT THE POLICY

31:12.204 --> 31:15.908
BEFORE THE SHOOTING?

31:15.942 --> 31:17.977
OKAY.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.946
THEN WE'RE LOOKING
AT HER SISTER.

31:19.979 --> 31:23.049
WHY WOULD SHE TAKE OUT
LIFE INSURANCE ON JEFF?

31:23.082 --> 31:25.952
- KIM TOLD ME
HE WAS INTO SHADY STUFF.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.453
I TOOK THAT TO MEAN DRUGS.

31:27.486 --> 31:29.922
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
SECURE HER BABY'S FUTURE

31:29.956 --> 31:31.657
IN CASE SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO JEFF.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.193
- OR SHE WAS GONNA MAKE
SOMETHING HAPPEN TO JEFF.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.028
- YOU THINK
SHE SET HER SISTER UP

31:36.062 --> 31:37.263
TO KILL THE FATHER
OF THAT CHILD?

31:37.296 --> 31:38.965
- I CHECKED
HER CELL PHONE RECORDS.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.934
SHE CALLED JEFF FOUR TIMES
AFTER SHE GOT TO NEW YORK.

31:41.968 --> 31:45.004
THE LAST CALL WAS TWO HOURS
BEFORE HE GOT SHOT.

31:45.037 --> 31:47.206
- WELL, THEY COULD
HAVE BEEN ARGUING, RIGHT?

31:47.239 --> 31:48.474
SHE COULD HAVE TOLD HIM
TO STAY AWAY.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.342
- BUT LIKE HE SAID,
SHE INVITED HIM.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.111
- SHE LURES HIM UP
TO THE APARTMENT.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.980
SHE KNOWS
THAT HE'S ARMED.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.949
SHE CRIES RAPE WHEN SHE HEARS
HER SISTER COMING.

31:56.983 --> 31:59.285
- AND STAGES DEATH
BY A COP.

31:59.318 --> 32:00.953
WE'VE ALL MET THIS GIRL,
RIGHT?

32:00.987 --> 32:02.154
SHE'S NO
CRIMINAL MASTERMIND.

32:02.188 --> 32:04.957
SHE'S--
- CRAZY.

32:04.991 --> 32:07.359
- IT'S NOT A GREAT PLAN.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.661
HER POLICY,
IT DOESN'T PAY OFF

32:09.695 --> 32:11.998
IF THE DECEASED IS KILLED
WHILE COMMITTING A FELONY.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.000
- WHICH IS
WHY SHE WENT TO IAB

32:14.033 --> 32:16.135
AND WITHDREW
THE RAPE ACCUSATION.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.105
- AND ALSO WHY AMANDA
WENT TO JAIL.

32:21.007 --> 32:22.608
- ALL RIGHT,
MR. HOROWITZ,

32:22.641 --> 32:25.177
GIVEN THE DETECTIVE'S
HISTORY OF GAMBLING

32:25.211 --> 32:27.179
AND THE SEVERE NATURE
OF THESE CHARGES,

32:27.213 --> 32:29.115
IS THERE ANY REASON
I SHOULDN'T GRANT

32:29.148 --> 32:31.050
THE PEOPLE'S REQUEST
FOR REMAND?

32:31.083 --> 32:33.585
- DETECTIVE ROLLINS IS A
DEDICATED CAREER POLICE OFFICER,

32:33.619 --> 32:36.055
YOUR HONOR, AND AS SUCH,

32:36.088 --> 32:37.656
HAS NO FINANCIAL MEANS
TO FLEE.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.525
SHE'LL SURRENDER
HER PASSPORT.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.428
WE REQUEST SHE BE RELEASED
UPON HER OWN RECOGNIZANCE.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.431
- WELL, I DON'T WISH
TO SEEM PUNITIVE,

32:45.464 --> 32:48.334
NOR SHOULD THE NYPD
GET ANY SPECIAL FAVORS,

32:48.367 --> 32:53.072
SO I'LL GRANT BAIL
AT $250,000.

32:53.105 --> 32:56.042
THE CASE IS ADJOURNED.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.377
- TAKE THAT AS A WIN.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.047
- HOW? I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.049
- IT'S TAKEN CARE OF,
AMANDA.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.120
- [sighs]

33:08.154 --> 33:10.089
CAPTAIN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

33:10.122 --> 33:13.259
- WELL, JUST DON'T JUMP
OR WE'LL ALL BE LIVING WITH FIN.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.761
- COME ON,
I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.530
- WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK
TO DO.

33:18.564 --> 33:21.367
- STARTING WITH
STRAIGHTENING OUT MY SISTER.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.303
- UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD
YOU SPEAK TO YOUR SISTER.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.272
- SHE JUST WANTS
THE INSURANCE MONEY.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.074
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

33:28.107 --> 33:31.810
- AMANDA, KIM SET YOU UP.
SHE PLANNED THIS WHOLE THING.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.446
- SHE NEVER PLANNED
A DAMN THING IN HER LIFE.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.748
- SHE'S A COOPERATING WITNESS
WITH IAB.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.784
- YOU'RE IN TROUBLE HERE.

33:38.817 --> 33:42.054
WITH KIM'S TESTIMONY, THEY HAVE
A SOLID CASE AGAINST YOU.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.455
DO NOT CONTACT HER.

33:43.489 --> 33:47.493
THEY WILL SLAP YOU WITH
WITNESS TAMPERING, COERCION.

33:47.526 --> 33:51.763
NOD IF YOU UNDERSTAND.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.765
- AMANDA, I KNOW
THIS IS PAINFUL,

33:53.799 --> 33:56.768
BUT SHE IS NOT
YOUR SISTER ANYMORE.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.108
[knock at door]

34:02.141 --> 34:03.775
- JEEZ.

34:03.809 --> 34:07.779
CHINESE FOOD DELIVERY
IS FAST AROUND HERE.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.751
AMANDA.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.754
- KIMBERLY.

34:15.787 --> 34:18.757
- HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

34:18.790 --> 34:21.460
- I'M A COP, KIM.

34:21.493 --> 34:24.830
- I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
TALK TO YOU, SO--

34:24.863 --> 34:27.666
- WE NEED SOME SISTER TIME,
ME AND YOU.

34:27.699 --> 34:31.103
- I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,
AND I'M--I'M SORRY.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.671
- YOU'RE SORRY.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.206
YOU PUT ME IN JAIL.

34:34.240 --> 34:36.342
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

34:36.375 --> 34:39.145
THAT MR. TUCKER, HE SAID
IT WAS ME OR YOU.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.512
- DID YOU TELL JEFF
TO COME TO NEW YORK?

34:40.546 --> 34:42.181
- NO.

34:45.517 --> 34:48.254
MAYBE.

34:48.287 --> 34:49.821
LOOK, I WAS--
I WAS LONELY.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.891
- DID YOU CALL HIM THAT NIGHT
AND TELL HIM TO COME OVER?

34:52.924 --> 34:54.260
WAS HE EVEN TRYING
TO RAPE YOU?

34:54.293 --> 34:55.527
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
STOP IT, ALL RIGHT?

34:55.561 --> 34:57.363
YOU ALWAYS DO THAT.
- I DO WHAT?

34:57.396 --> 34:58.697
- YOU MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.832
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:00.866 --> 35:02.668
YOU DON'T GET TO DO THAT
RIGHT NOW.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.504
YOU DON'T GET TO GO THERE.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.806
IT'S TRUE. YOU SET ME UP.
YOU SET JEFF UP.

35:07.839 --> 35:11.109
YOU WANTED ME TO KILL HIM.

35:13.212 --> 35:16.382
- HE WAS A BAD MAN,
AMANDA.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.724
- OH, MY GOD.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.259
- HE BEAT ME.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.695
WHEN YOU WALKED IN,
HE WAS HURTING ME.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.431
- OH.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.901
- YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

35:35.934 --> 35:38.737
YOU'RE TOO BIG
FOR YOUR BRITCHES.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.806
YOU'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU WERE BETTER THAN US.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.174
- THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.575
- MAMA USED TO SAY THAT
ALL THAT AMBITION

35:43.609 --> 35:45.544
WOULD GET YOU
IN TROUBLE SOME DAY.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.884
- ARE YOU EVEN PREGNANT?

35:52.918 --> 35:55.721
- HOW CAN YOU
EVEN ASK ME THAT?

35:57.989 --> 35:59.925
- DON'T--JUST--

35:59.958 --> 36:01.927
- I THOUGHT I WAS.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.795
I WAS A WEEK LATE.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.777
- [sniffles]

36:28.887 --> 36:33.492
- DETECTIVE, I'M--I'M JUST
ABOUT TO START A SESSION.

36:33.525 --> 36:37.629
- MY SISTER SET ME UP.

36:37.663 --> 36:39.465
I'M BEING CHARGED
WITH MURDER.

36:39.498 --> 36:43.602
WELL, YOU SAID
IF I FELT ANY ANXIETY--

36:43.635 --> 36:46.438
- WE CAN SET UP
AN APPOINTMENT.

36:46.472 --> 36:49.775
- OH, RIGHT, YEAH.

36:49.808 --> 36:53.279
- I DO WORK FOR NYPD,

36:53.312 --> 36:57.549
BUT I CAN RECOMMEND SOMEONE
OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.425
[indistinct
radio transmissions]

37:09.060 --> 37:12.598
- NICK.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.700
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

37:14.733 --> 37:17.536
- I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR ANY OF THIS TO HAPPEN.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.972
THAT LIEUTENANT TUCKER,
HE TWISTS EVERYTHING I SAY.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.541
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN,
BUT, KIM,

37:22.574 --> 37:24.009
I REALLY CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.512
- NOBODY CAN.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.514
I'M--I'M SORRY.

37:28.547 --> 37:32.518
I GUESS THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.553
- HEY.

37:41.627 --> 37:44.262
HAVE YOU BEEN EATING?

37:46.031 --> 37:49.935
- UH, I'LL HAVE
THE LOBSTER, PLEASE.

37:49.968 --> 37:54.005
- SORRY, MY,
UH, DAUGHTER.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.775
SHE JUST LEARNED
HOW TO TEXT.

37:56.808 --> 38:00.446
- [laughs]
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD DAD.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.784
DID AMANDA TELL YOU
I LOST THE BABY?

38:05.817 --> 38:09.855
- NO.
I'M SORRY, I-I DIDN'T KNOW.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.491
IAB TOLD US
NOT TO TALK TO HER.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.361
- SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY,
RIGHT?

38:15.394 --> 38:17.396
I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO GO TO PRISON.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.398
- I CAN SEE THAT.

38:19.431 --> 38:20.866
- YOU CAN, RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

38:20.899 --> 38:24.102
- YOU'RE A GOOD DETECTIVE.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.104
MY SISTER
UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.540
- REALLY?

38:28.574 --> 38:29.541
[both laugh]

38:29.575 --> 38:31.543
- YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.579
ALWAYS THINKS SHE'S
THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE ROOM.

38:33.612 --> 38:36.882
- AH, YEAH, SHE DOES
HAVE THAT SIDE.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.585
WHICH IS WHY I DON'T KNOW

38:39.618 --> 38:41.787
HOW SHE GOT
IN THIS SITUATION.

38:41.820 --> 38:46.124
- I JUST DON'T THINK SHE LIKES
TO ADMIT SHE MADE A MISTAKE.

38:46.157 --> 38:50.061
- A MISTAKE? WAIT,
DO YOU MEAN THE SHOOTING?

38:52.731 --> 38:55.867
BUT YOU TOLD HER JEFF
WAS RAPING YOU.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.870
- OH, HE WAS,
BUT AFTER I FOUND OUT

38:58.904 --> 39:01.640
ABOUT THAT FELONY CLAUSE,
I JUST KEPT TELLING HER

39:01.673 --> 39:03.475
TO SAY THAT THE SHOOTING
WAS AN ACCIDENT

39:03.509 --> 39:05.577
AND THEN WE'D BOTH BE RICH.

39:05.611 --> 39:07.579
- BUT YOU WERE
LOOKING OUT FOR HER.

39:07.613 --> 39:09.915
I GET THAT.

39:09.948 --> 39:13.719
AND THAT'S WHY YOU PUT HER NAME
IN THAT INSURANCE POLICY.

39:13.752 --> 39:16.388
- I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK BAD
IF IT WAS JUST ME.

39:16.422 --> 39:17.623
- SURE.

39:17.656 --> 39:18.924
- BESIDES, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW,

39:18.957 --> 39:21.960
BUT SHE'S GOT
GAMBLING DEBTS.

39:23.762 --> 39:24.830
- I HEARD THAT.

39:27.433 --> 39:30.602
LOOK,
THE WAY IT LOOKS NOW,

39:30.636 --> 39:34.540
SHE CAME IN AND SHOT JEFF
IN COLD BLOOD.

39:34.573 --> 39:36.608
BUT YOU SAID
JEFF HAD A GUN.

39:36.642 --> 39:39.177
- WELL, HE DID HAVE A GUN.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.047
BUT I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO GET SHOT.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.915
I JUST WANTED HIM--

39:43.949 --> 39:48.520
- YOU WANTED JEFF GONE?

39:49.888 --> 39:52.424
- HE WAS A BAD MAN.

39:54.693 --> 39:57.629
WHAT HE DID TO ME...

39:57.663 --> 40:00.065
SHE ONLY KNEW
THE HALF OF IT.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.703
BUT AFTER I FOUND OUT
ABOUT THAT FELONY CLAUSE,

40:04.736 --> 40:05.904
I JUST KEPT TELLING HER
TO SAY

40:05.937 --> 40:07.639
THAT THE SHOOTING
WAS AN ACCIDENT

40:07.673 --> 40:09.608
AND THEN WE'D BOTH BE RICH.

40:09.641 --> 40:12.544
- SHE GOES ON TO COMPLETELY
IMPLICATE HERSELF

40:12.578 --> 40:14.646
AND EXONERATE MY CLIENT.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.015
- OKAY.

40:17.048 --> 40:19.150
IF THAT RECORDING
CHECKS OUT--

40:19.184 --> 40:22.454
- WHAT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

40:22.488 --> 40:24.623
- WE'LL BE DROPPING
THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU

40:24.656 --> 40:25.924
AND PURSUING YOUR SISTER.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.860
- LIEUTENANT...

40:28.894 --> 40:32.097
YOU CAN CLEARLY HEAR
ON THAT RECORDING,

40:32.130 --> 40:33.699
HE THREATENED HER.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.667
HE ABUSED HER.

40:35.701 --> 40:37.503
- SHE'LL BE ARRESTED.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.605
I'LL ASK THE D.A.
TO PURSUE MURDER CHARGES.

40:39.638 --> 40:40.806
- I DON'T WANT THAT.

40:40.839 --> 40:43.575
- AMANDA,
YOU HAVE TO LET HER GO.

40:43.609 --> 40:46.177
- SHE'S STILL MY--
MY SISTER.

40:46.211 --> 40:49.214
[crying]

40:54.686 --> 40:56.221
- LET'S GO.

41:08.133 --> 41:09.801
[knock at door]

41:09.835 --> 41:11.837
- MS. ROLLINS.

41:17.943 --> 41:19.945
[electronic lock beeps]

41:25.150 --> 41:27.619
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

41:42.067 --> 41:46.705
- "I HELPED MYSELF
TO SOME THINGS.

41:46.738 --> 41:48.574
"I'M SORRY.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.610
I LOVE YOU, AMANDA."

41:55.614 --> 41:59.117
[crying]
