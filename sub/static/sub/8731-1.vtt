NARRATOR: They called it
the car for Everyman.

01:32.192 --> 01:36.037
Henry Ford himself
called it a car
for the "great multitude."

01:37.797 --> 01:42.746
It was functional and simple,
like your sewing machine
or your cast-iron stove.

01:45.138 --> 01:48.244
You could learn to drive it
in less than a day,

01:48.808 --> 01:52.812
and you could get
any color you wanted,
so long as it was black.

01:55.715 --> 02:00.561
When Ford first conceived
the Model T, it took
13 hours to assemble.

02:02.589 --> 02:06.628
Within five years,
he was turning out
a vehicle every 90 seconds.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.266
Of course, the real invention
wasn't the car,

02:12.332 --> 02:14.709
it was the assembly line
that built it.

02:16.669 --> 02:20.617
Pretty soon, other businesses
had borrowed
the same techniques.

02:21.374 --> 02:24.480
Seamstresses
became button sewers.

02:24.544 --> 02:27.524
Furniture makers
became knob turners.

02:28.848 --> 02:32.227
It was the beginning
and the end of imagination

02:32.285 --> 02:34.628

05:49.248 --> 05:51.694
It's a Stanley Steamer.
The boiler blew.

05:51.751 --> 05:53.628

Sure. Sure, I can fix it.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.336
CHARLES: This is
an amazing machine.

06:42.034 --> 06:46.539
It's got a two-stroke
boiler system that's heated
by this huge fire grade.

06:46.606 --> 06:50.519
I mean, it's...
Well, it's basically
a very small locomotive.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.580
Thank you.
Now, I made
some improvements.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.059
It wasn't your boiler
that was blowing,
it was your bleed valve.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.253
So, with
the increased pressure,

06:58.317 --> 07:01.195

07:01.254 --> 07:02.698
Really?
Oh, yeah.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.258
And if you superheat
the excess,
I can see you reaching...

07:05.691 --> 07:08.671
Fifty, maybe sixty miles
an hour.
Is that right?

07:08.728 --> 07:12.801
Easily. And the thing
of it is, Mr. Coughlin,
you don't feed it,

07:12.865 --> 07:15.402
you don't stable it,
and unless
you hit a lamppost,

07:15.468 --> 07:18.107

get sick and die on you.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.284

27:23.375 --> 27:25.855
you couldn't get one
in the United States
of America.

27:27.612 --> 27:30.991
Liquor was illegal.
Diversions were scarce,

27:31.049 --> 27:34.587
and there's just so much
a human being can do without.

27:36.554 --> 27:38.863
Soon, the border town
was born,

27:39.157 --> 27:43.833
providing everything to
the south that their neighbor
to the north would not.

27:45.263 --> 27:50.109
You could find anything:
food, companionship,

27:50.402 --> 27:54.680
decent gin,
and with gambling
outlawed as well,

27:56.408 --> 27:59.150
the chance to turn
bad luck into good.

28:04.983 --> 28:08.430
Relax! You got it!
You got it! You got it!

28:08.486 --> 28:09.521
Go!

28:10.455 --> 28:11.490
Damn it.

28:11.556 --> 28:14.161
That jockey was riding
like he's got an anvil
in his pocket.

28:14.225 --> 28:17.171
I no bet with you no more.
I no like it.

28:24.469 --> 28:25.777
Who's that?

28:25.837 --> 28:28.374
George Woolf.
Greatest jockey in the world.

28:42.187 --> 28:44.462
MARCELA:
That's Charles Howard?
WOMAN: Yeah.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.366
I thought he came
down here for a...
Quickie divorce?

28:48.426 --> 28:49.563
Why?

28:50.095 --> 28:51.767
Look at him.

28:53.965 --> 28:56.138
Nothing quick about that.

28:56.601 --> 28:58.171
(GRUNTING)

29:17.689 --> 29:20.499
It was in the palace
of the great Sultan.

29:20.892 --> 29:22.496
MAN: Sultan of where?

29:22.994 --> 29:25.201
The Sultan of Araby.

29:25.830 --> 29:27.832
I'd been living there
for almost a year,

29:27.899 --> 29:30.402
racing his Arabians
across the desert by day

29:30.468 --> 29:34.040
and finishing
my personal history
of the region by night.

29:34.305 --> 29:38.446
Then one day,
the Sultan summons me
into his throne room.

29:39.644 --> 29:42.715
He looks at me and says,

29:42.781 --> 29:44.123
"John Pollard..."
"John Pollard,

29:44.182 --> 29:49.028
"you are my greatest jockey.
It is you I have chosen

29:49.087 --> 29:53.660
"to ride my 100-mile race
from Kusma to Tripoli."

29:54.592 --> 29:55.866
200-mile.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.767
All right. 200-mile.
Excuse me, sahib.

30:03.034 --> 30:04.478
RED: You didn't need
to wreck it, Georgie.

30:04.536 --> 30:07.573
When you
started telling that story,
it was only 50 miles.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.619
Yeah, well,
everything gets longer
in the retelling.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.654
Just ask your friend
Wanda over there.

30:13.745 --> 30:16.384
You know, if you start
riding a little more
and talking a little less,

30:16.447 --> 30:18.051
you might start
winning some races.

30:18.116 --> 30:19.925
Well, I got two bucks
says I beat you in this one.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.292
I'm not sure if you do,

30:21.352 --> 30:23.991
but I got five
says I beat you.
Done.

30:24.088 --> 30:25.828
(BELL RINGING)

30:28.927 --> 30:31.703
Give me odds.
You're the favorite.
Even money.

30:31.763 --> 30:35.676
Nah! Forget it! 2-to-1!
All right. You got it.

30:35.733 --> 30:39.305
Hey, Johnny. You're on
a speed horse. What are you
doing back here with me?

30:39.370 --> 30:42.680
I like the conversation,
and it's not a speed horse.
Don't try to hook me.

30:42.740 --> 30:45.015
You going tonight?
Nah. You?

30:45.076 --> 30:47.647
Nah.
What time?

30:47.712 --> 30:50.590
I don't know. 8:00?
Okey-doke.

30:50.648 --> 30:53.458
Oops, there's my hole!

I'll take him.

out of here.

31:21.746 --> 31:24.590

don't need your charity.

is that?

need a trainer

You don't know. I don't know,
maybe you want a smaller barn,

somebody who can
take the time to...
Who's that?

39:54.892 --> 39:58.271
He's a crackpot.
Lives alone in the bushes.

39:59.864 --> 40:01.343
What's he do?

40:01.599 --> 40:05.376
I don't know. He used to be
a trainer, farrier. Now he
just looks after that horse.

at another barn.

What's...
What's in his bandage?

40:55.419 --> 40:58.161
Oh, that's hawthorn root.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.931
It increases circulation.

41:13.337 --> 41:15.077
Will he get better?

41:15.473 --> 41:17.384
Already is, a little.

41:19.076 --> 41:20.555
Will he race?

41:22.980 --> 41:25.983
No. Not that one.

41:28.085 --> 41:30.121
So why are you
fixing him?

41:32.122 --> 41:33.601
'Cause I can.

41:36.894 --> 41:39.340
Every horse is good
for something.

41:40.998 --> 41:45.071
He could be a cart horse
or a lead pony.

41:45.236 --> 41:47.545
And he's still nice
to look at.

41:48.539 --> 41:52.452
You don't...
You don't throw
a whole life away

41:52.510 --> 41:55.047
just 'cause
he's banged up a little.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.394
Is that coffee?

42:11.695 --> 42:12.798
Yeah.

42:18.168 --> 42:19.806
It's bad, though.

42:20.404 --> 42:21.678
(CHUCKLES)

42:22.339 --> 42:24.375
You always tell the truth?

42:25.042 --> 42:26.577
Yeah, I try to.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.370
TOM: It ain't just the speed.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.431
It's the heart.

42:47.831 --> 42:50.937
And you want something
that's not afraid to compete.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.276
Half these horses
are just show ponies.

42:55.306 --> 42:58.981
You want something
that's not gonna run
from a fight.

42:59.977 --> 43:01.786
How do you find that?

43:03.280 --> 43:07.853
Look, I won the Robles
Handicap. I was second
in the Tijuana Derby.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.762
I won the Manzanita Oaks.
You know, that used
to be a stakes race.

43:10.821 --> 43:13.563
I know.
I would've won, T.J. ,

43:13.624 --> 43:17.071
but the piece of shit
lugged out on me.
Sounds great.
We'll let you know.

43:17.528 --> 43:20.008
Look. I can work them out
in the morning.

43:21.699 --> 43:24.679
Or even hot-walk them
if you need me to.

43:25.302 --> 43:27.782
Really? You'll hot-walk them?

43:29.406 --> 43:31.317
This is something else.

43:32.810 --> 43:35.051
A dream come true,
walking you around.

43:35.112 --> 43:39.185
Hook you up to a plow,
pull me around
for a little while. Come on.

43:40.317 --> 43:42.319
You ever run in the money?

43:43.454 --> 43:47.458
Hey. Hey.
You ever run in the money?
I don't think so.

43:48.559 --> 43:51.266
Couldn't beat a human being,
let alone another horse.

43:52.896 --> 43:56.866
You goddamn sack-of-crap
old plater. Probably the
fastest you're gonna run

43:56.934 --> 43:59.914
in your entire life,
you piece-of-shit
old glue-pot.

44:00.037 --> 44:01.277
That's right.

44:21.592 --> 44:23.867
NARRATOR: The first time
he saw Seabiscuit,

44:23.927 --> 44:27.499
the colt was walking
through the fog
at 5:00 in the morning.

44:28.232 --> 44:32.145
Smith would say later
that the horse looked
right through him,

44:32.202 --> 44:35.308
as if to say,
"What the hell
are you looking at?

44:35.539 --> 44:37.643
"Who do you think you are?"

44:40.444 --> 44:43.686
He was a small horse,
barely 15 hands.

44:44.381 --> 44:48.192
He was hurting, too.
There was a limp in his walk,

44:48.986 --> 44:51.125
a wheezing when he breathed.

44:52.189 --> 44:54.692
Smith didn't pay
attention to that.

44:55.292 --> 44:57.829
He was looking the horse
in the eye.

45:00.030 --> 45:02.442
God damn.

45:09.139 --> 45:13.451
He was the son of Hard Tack,
sired by the mighty
Man o' War.

45:13.744 --> 45:17.692
But the breeding
did little to impress
anyone at Claiborne Farms.

45:17.748 --> 45:19.283
Get rid of him.

45:24.588 --> 45:27.227
At six months,
he was shipped off to train

45:27.291 --> 45:29.794
with the legendary trainer
"Sunny" Fitzsimmons,

45:29.860 --> 45:33.739
who, over time,
developed a similar opinion
of the colt.

45:34.164 --> 45:36.667
Is that a racehorse
or a lead pony?

45:39.036 --> 45:42.039
The judgment wasn't helped
by his gentle nature.

45:42.106 --> 45:45.815
Where his sire
had been a fierce,
almost violent competitor,

45:45.876 --> 45:49.448
Seabiscuit took to sleeping
for huge chunks of the day

45:49.646 --> 45:53.821
and enjoyed lolling for hours
under the boughs
of the juniper trees.

45:55.719 --> 45:58.165
His other great talent
was eating.

45:58.589 --> 46:00.591
Though half the size
of other colts,

46:00.657 --> 46:03.296
Seabiscuit could frequently
eat twice as much.

46:05.095 --> 46:07.905
Fitzsimmons decided
the horse was lazy

46:07.965 --> 46:11.435
and felt sure he could train
the obstinance out of him.

46:11.635 --> 46:15.310
I want you to hit him
as many times as you can
over a quarter of a mile.

46:16.507 --> 46:20.420
When he didn't improve,
they decided
the colt was incorrigible.

46:22.880 --> 46:25.622
They made him
a training partner
to better horses,

46:25.682 --> 46:28.025
forcing him to lose
head-to-head duels

46:28.085 --> 46:30.997
to boost the confidence
of the other animal.

46:31.722 --> 46:33.701
By the time
he was three years old,

46:33.757 --> 46:37.568
Seabiscuit was struggling
in two cheap claiming
races a week.

46:38.529 --> 46:43.239
Soon he grew as bitter
and angry as his sire
Hard Tack had been.

46:45.302 --> 46:49.113
He was sold
for the rock-bottom price
of $2,000.

46:52.543 --> 46:54.989
And, of course,
it all made sense.

46:56.113 --> 46:59.184

01:33:59.433 --> 01:34:02.778
Look, most of the damage
was restricted to his leg.

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:07.212
How bad is it?
God, I don't know.
It's shattered.

01:34:07.675 --> 01:34:09.677
Eleven, twelve breaks.
Something like that.

01:34:09.744 --> 01:34:11.917
We're gonna have to operate.

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:14.991
Just sit tight for me.

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:58.433
DOCTOR: Well, we're all done.

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:02.936
He'll always limp,
but it looks like
he's gonna walk again.

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:08.212
Will he ride?
No, he's not gonna ride.

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:11.881
You're sure?
He won't ride.
But he's gonna walk.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.752
You take care.
Thank you.

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:21.751
Hey.

the other guy.

the stories, remember?

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:37.139
Well, yeah.

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:40.776
Maybe a little
longer than that.

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:42.973
Yeah.

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:48.983
Look, I think we're gonna
have to scratch.

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.890
No. No, don't scratch.

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:56.724

but he can't run by himself.

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:58.285

No, we're not gonna scratch.

Red Pollard wants
Seabiscuit to win this race

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:22.176
more than anything
in the world.

01:36:22.243 --> 01:36:24.086

I appreciate it.
You're welcome.

TICK-TOCK: The Iceman cometh!
What a pinch hitter.

01:36:32.119 --> 01:36:34.189
Why, it's like getting
Babe Ruth off the bench.

01:36:34.255 --> 01:36:37.793
Nerves of steel,
ice water in his veins.
Why, George Woolf is...

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:39.234
Irrelevant.

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:41.238
They can get
the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:43.900
as far as I'm concerned.
Won't make any difference.

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:47.411
War Admiral
is a superior horse
with superior breeding.

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:49.641
Doesn't matter
who the passenger is.

01:36:51.939 --> 01:36:54.112
He's got a strong
left lead, Georgie.

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:56.518
Banks like
a frigging airplane.

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:58.181
But he might need help
switching to it,

01:36:58.245 --> 01:37:00.725
so ease him off the rail
just before the turn.

01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:03.488
Like you did
in the Gold Cup.
Exactly.

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:06.156
He needs a good warm-up,
so take him out slow.

01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:08.996
When you do ask him,
don't use the whip.

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:13.036
Just flick it twice,
show him it's there.
He'll know it's time.

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.466
Right.

01:37:16.964 --> 01:37:19.103
And never on the left side.

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.612
They hit him on the left side
when he was a baby.

01:37:22.937 --> 01:37:25.883
I wish it was you, Johnny.
Come on.

01:37:26.974 --> 01:37:29.215
I'll be right there with you.

01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:33.021
(GEORGE MARSHALLING HORSE)

01:37:37.785 --> 01:37:42.165
Great. Now, show him the stick
at the quarter pole,

01:37:43.123 --> 01:37:45.694
and he'll give you
a whole new gear.

01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:51.306
RED: Okay, now,

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:55.302
force him to that left lead
a little earlier,

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:58.111
and he'll give you even more.

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:02.079
Great.

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:04.588
Now, shut the door.

01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:25.973
Okay. You know how Smith
wants you to fight for
the lead by the first turn?

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:29.206
Well, yeah. We were
working with that bell.

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:33.214
I was a little nervous
about that.
No, no, it's fine.

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:36.016
But you gotta give it up
on the backstretch.

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:38.783
Give it up?
Give him back the lead.

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:42.583
He fights for it, Georgie.

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:46.162
If you bring him head to head
with that other horse,

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:48.393
and he looks him in the eye,

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:51.102
there's no way
he loses that race.

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:54.435
You just hold him
through that final turn

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:57.373
and let him get a good look
at the Admiral.

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.069
Then let him go.

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:02.676
It's not in his feet, Georgie.

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:06.643
It's right here.

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:14.582
NARRATOR: By 10:00 a.m.,
the closest place to park

01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:16.422
was 15 blocks away.

01:39:16.817 --> 01:39:19.957
The volume of refreshments
alone was staggering.

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:23.061
Seventeen thousand gallons
of lemonade.

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:25.125
Sixty thousand hot dogs.

01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:27.795
Two thousand kegs of beer.

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:30.674
NBC broadcast the race,

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:33.871
and businesses around America
scheduled a half day of work

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:36.175
so their employees
could hear the call,

01:39:36.236 --> 01:39:40.445
thanks in part to a missive
fired by Mr. Howard
only the day before.

01:39:40.507 --> 01:39:43.078
Look, I know this is
a fancy track and all,

01:39:43.143 --> 01:39:45.213
but I think they ought to
open up the infield,

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:47.952
so normal folks
can come see the race.

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:51.161
You shouldn't have to be rich
to enjoy something like this.

NARRATOR:
Seabiscuit entered the race
a 2-to-1 underdog,

01:39:55.389 --> 01:39:58.961
but you would never know it
from the growing noise
in the infield.

BOY: Get your program!

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:01.737
By the time it was over,

01:40:01.795 --> 01:40:05.105
more than 40 million Americans
would hear the call.

01:40:05.966 --> 01:40:10.141
TOM: Okay, it's still
kind of soggy at the rails,

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:12.911
so try to keep him
out of there.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:17.017
There's a dry tractor tread
about five feet
out off the fence.

01:40:17.077 --> 01:40:19.454

this morning.

01:40:20.214 --> 01:40:21.749
Good. Good.

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:26.929
Now, he ought to break
just like we worked on.

01:40:28.722 --> 01:40:31.361
But there's one more thing.

01:40:32.659 --> 01:40:35.537
What? Let him catch me
on the backstretch?

01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:39.910

who knows this horse.
