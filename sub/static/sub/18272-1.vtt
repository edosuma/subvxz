Oh, come on!

our esteemed club president
Pat 'The Rat' Shepherd.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.676
- Thank you, Pat.

04:49.708 --> 04:51.710
Thanks very much, mate.
Much appreciated.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.255

- Well...

05:02.375 --> 05:04.469
- No, really, how do you do it?

05:04.583 --> 05:06.176
He was only sober
for four of 'em.

05:06.292 --> 05:09.045
- Oh, Cheeky Graeme.

05:09.167 --> 05:12.467
Listen, if your form on the
field was as good as it is off

05:12.583 --> 05:14.085
we might have won five games!

05:18.083 --> 05:19.881
OK, listen up.

05:20.917 --> 05:23.011
Clubman of the Year.

05:23.125 --> 05:27.551
Now, this year's winner
exemplifies the qualities

05:27.667 --> 05:30.386
of a truly great clubman -

05:30.500 --> 05:32.753
loyalty,

05:32.875 --> 05:35.503
endurance,

05:35.625 --> 05:38.299
resilience,

05:38.417 --> 05:40.465
always putting the team
above himself.

05:40.583 --> 05:44.338
Now, this kid
may not kick the most goals,

05:44.458 --> 05:47.257
he may not take the most marks,

05:47.375 --> 05:49.548
in fact, he may not even make
the team next year,

05:49.667 --> 05:52.011
- by the sounds of it.

05:52.125 --> 05:58.292
But after playing
a record 154 consecutive games,

05:58.417 --> 06:02.376
the winner of the 1983 West
Sunshine Clubman of the Year

06:02.500 --> 06:05.379
is the endurable Ray Jenkins!

06:05.500 --> 06:07.002
- Oh, Ray!

06:07.125 --> 06:09.719
- Come up here, Ray.
- Good on you, mate.

06:09.833 --> 06:11.881
- Well done. Well deserved.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.925

06:32.875 --> 06:34.752
Congratulations.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.422

it was your bloody cousin.'

06:56.458 --> 06:58.677
- It's a true story.

06:58.792 --> 07:01.386

mole from Essendon again,

07:01.500 --> 07:03.002

07:04.833 --> 07:07.302
Hey, don't do anything silly
in Thailand, fellas.

07:07.417 --> 07:08.919
- Not us.
- Never, hey?

07:09.042 --> 07:11.591
Just be careful.
Don't come home with anything-.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.881
Go on, get oui of here.
Give me a minute with him.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.965

next weekend?

07:22.083 --> 07:24.381
Yeah, why?
You need something done?

07:24.500 --> 07:26.753
Swing by Paradise,
pick up a free keg.

07:28.875 --> 07:32.755
- What about Raymond? He going?
- Where?

07:32.875 --> 07:35.219
Thailand, knucklehead.

07:35.333 --> 07:38.212
Doubt it. You'd have to pry him
eff his mum's tit.

07:39.708 --> 07:43.338
Can't have the Clubman of
the Year not touring, can we?

07:46.542 --> 07:48.169

08:22.625 --> 08:27.131

- Yes, Mum.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.878
And is that the dashing
Gavin Ellis with you?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.593

the Clubman of the Year home.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.092
Oh, yeah?

09:00.208 --> 09:02.711
Well, the Clubman of the Year
can escort himself inside

09:02.833 --> 09:04.676
and set the table.

09:04.792 --> 09:07.796
- John?

09:07.917 --> 09:10.386

have a play with the ladies -

09:35.208 --> 09:38.132

a bloke like you, and your mum.

09:41.292 --> 09:43.590
Nah, mate. I'm sorry.
I'm not your man,

09:45.208 --> 09:47.427
Besides,
I wouldn't be any good at it.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.044

09:49.167 --> 09:51.420
and stop your mum getting hurt
over a card game.

09:51.542 --> 09:53.260
- What do you mean?
- Don't answer now.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.423
Mull it over,
let me know at my party.

09:58.417 --> 10:00.920
Here's some cash for a cab.

10:03.708 --> 10:07.633
Go on, take it.
It's yours, for the cab.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.965

Yeah, we need a bit of rain.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.045
Hopefully it'll clear up,
though.

10:42.167 --> 10:44.386
- That'd be nice.
- Yeah.

Why are you and Gavin
knocking around again?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.256
He hasn't been over
since they lived next door.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.093
He just gave me a lift home
from work, Mum.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.677
Yeah, well, he's bad news, Ray.
He's been in jail.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.886
It was a youth offenders unit.

11:15.917 --> 11:18.215
He cut that poor boy up
with a chisel.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.461

- Where's my car?
- They took it.

58:40.792 --> 58:44.092
Who took it? Who took it?!

58:44.208 --> 58:46.882
Your mate Pat Shepherd
fuckin' took it.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.083
What? Why would he do that?
Whats wrong with his car?

58:50.208 --> 58:52.927
- Nothing wrong with his car.
- Then why would he take ours'?

58:56.125 --> 58:57.627
John...

58:59.500 --> 59:01.047

59:01.167 --> 59:02.510
Hoh... hoh.“

59:02.625 --> 59:04.343
Why would he take our car?

59:04.458 --> 59:06.711
John, answer me -

59:06.833 --> 59:08.881
why would he take our car?

59:09.000 --> 59:12.300
Because I paid for the drugs
inside Ray!

59:12.417 --> 59:14.385
What?

59:14.500 --> 59:16.923
We went behind Shepherds back.

59:17.042 --> 59:19.340
Right, he found out
and he came over,

59:19.458 --> 59:21.802
he came over and he took
the car, just like that.

59:21.917 --> 59:23.419
You're pissed. You are pissed.

59:23.542 --> 59:25.419
All Ray had to do was wait
for his luggage,

59:25.542 --> 59:27.215
the dopey fuckin' prick!

59:27.333 --> 59:29.335
- You are a liar!
- He did! Agreed to swallow.

59:29.458 --> 59:32.177
- He wouldn't do it! Get out!
- Yeah? Yeah?

59:32.292 --> 59:35.262
- Have a go! Get out!
- Fuckin' calm down!

59:35.375 --> 59:38.549
- Fuckin' calm”. calm down!
- Get out! Get out!

59:38.667 --> 59:40.544
Get out! Don't come back!

59:43.500 --> 59:46.094
- Oh'

59:46.208 --> 59:49.838
Dan, it's a disease, you know.
I'm sorry.

59:53.875 --> 59:59.882
Darl, I'll fix it, alright?
You'll see. Slay there.

01:00:02.542 --> 01:00:04.340
I'll fix it

01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:13.587
Ray...

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:23.963
Shepherd!
I know you're in there!

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:27.462
I want my fuckin' car back!

01:00:27.583 --> 01:00:29.802
I want my car back
or I'm going to the cops!

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:39.755
I'll shut you down,
your whole business!

01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:41.047
Shut up!

01:00:41.167 --> 01:00:42.965
Do you hear me?

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:48.256
Yes, John.

01:00:48.375 --> 01:00:50.218
Loud and clear.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:53.548
I want my car back, Pat.

01:00:53.667 --> 01:00:56.045
This is no way to go about it.

01:00:56.167 --> 01:00:59.171
You're making
a spectacle of yourself.

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:05.711
Mate, Jude's gonna leave me.

01:01:08.333 --> 01:01:12.964
Alright. I'll get the keys.
Just keep the noise down.

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:19.631
Oh.

01:01:20.708 --> 01:01:23.507
- Bloody hell. You're a mess.
- Yeah, I know.

01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:25.127
I'm really sorry, Pat.

01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:28.585
I'm sorry, mate.

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:33.550
You bloody went out with her...
Jude-.

01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:35.590
Bloody hell,
you know what she's like.

01:01:37.417 --> 01:01:38.919
Oh, fuck.

01:01:39.042 --> 01:01:41.136
- Oh, thanks, mate.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.004
For fuck's sake! Pat!

01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:49.469
It was Gav!

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:53.757
Fuckin' Gav's idea...

01:01:53.875 --> 01:01:55.969
What the fuck, Pat! Aargh!

Yeah.

01:03:30.792 --> 01:03:32.840
I made you some lunch.

No, you didn't.

and you'll make
your old mum proud.

01:04:02.458 --> 01:04:04.256

Hi. I'm personal life coach
Professor Dylan Kanarakis...

01:05:27.583 --> 01:05:29.085
Unfortunately, Ray,

01:05:29.208 --> 01:05:31.961
a magistrate has granted the
police a three-day extension.

01:05:33.208 --> 01:05:34.801
I don't know how.

01:05:34.917 --> 01:05:37.386
But they're now
permitted to detain you

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:42.085
for up to and including
ten days.

01:08:37.417 --> 01:08:39.465
I've gone to the toilet.

01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:47.877

- Huh'?

Well, Ray, we might have to
lei you go after all.

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:32.666
All we need to do
is get you to an X-ray machine.

01:09:32.792 --> 01:09:35.636
No, I won.

01:09:37.207 --> 01:09:38.710
The proof is in here.

01:09:38.832 --> 01:09:41.712
Listen to me, fuckwit,
you haven't won anything.

01:09:41.832 --> 01:09:44.086
Oh!

Animal? Kangaroo.

01:10:17.583 --> 01:10:19.836
- What's your favourite car?
- Holden.

01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:22.757
That's football, meat pies,
kangaroos and Holden cars.

01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:24.047
Right.

01:10:24.167 --> 01:10:25.965
You sure sound
like Australia to me!

I handed it to them
on a fucking platter.

01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:35.627
It was the perfect case study...

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:38.173
I've got 20 condoms of heroin
in my stomach.

01:10:38.292 --> 01:10:39.509
I know'

01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:41.627
All they care about
is a bunch of rich pricks

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:43.673
playing 'Who's got
the biggest dick?'

01:10:43.792 --> 01:10:46.295

the last of Jasmine...

01:10:46.417 --> 01:10:49.216
I've got 20 condoms of heroin

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:52.007
Keep your voice down, Ray.

01:10:53.208 --> 01:10:56.542
I've got 20 condoms
of someone's fucking heroin

01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:58.385
in my fucking stomach.

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.093
Shh'

01:11:01.167 --> 01:11:05.217
You need to hold on.
Just a little bit longer.

01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:09.167
I'm not gonna let
that arrogant prick beat us.

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:12.546
We can win this together.

01:11:12.667 --> 01:11:16.092
- What are you talking about?
- Shh!

01:11:18.667 --> 01:11:22.626
Just hold on.

01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:33.545
A shiv?
Not sure this is a good idea.

01:11:33.667 --> 01:11:35.169
Mate, there's cops everywhere.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:37.795
They're all over him. What the
fuck am I supposed to do?

01:11:37.917 --> 01:11:41.672
- Aaah!
- Not my problem. Your problem.

01:11:41.792 --> 01:11:43.669
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Alright, alright!

01:11:43.792 --> 01:11:45.339
Let go, let go!

01:11:47.083 --> 01:11:48.881
I'll be watching.

01:12:05.708 --> 01:12:08.177

And who are you?

01:12:26.833 --> 01:12:30.087
I'm the captain
of his footy team.

01:12:31.917 --> 01:12:33.419
The captain?

01:12:37.667 --> 01:12:40.591
- Who told you he was here?
- Our coach.

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:46.461
Well, unfortunately, he's in
police custody at the moment,

01:12:46.583 --> 01:12:48.551
so he's not receiving
any visitors.

01:12:48.667 --> 01:12:50.715
Mate, I've walked all the way
from Sunshine.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:53.382
I'll only be five minutes.
Promise.

01:12:55.167 --> 01:12:57.920
Alright.
Why not? Arms up.

01:13:04.583 --> 01:13:07.666
- Your captain's here.
- Gav.

01:13:07.792 --> 01:13:09.294
Jesus.

01:13:12.708 --> 01:13:14.881
No, mate,
I'm the only one here.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.094
The boys are home
with diarrhea.

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:20.093
Where are they?

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.343
Bullshit'

01:13:27.458 --> 01:13:29.552
What have you told 'em?

01:13:29.667 --> 01:13:34.628
Look at me.
I haven't told 'em anything.

01:13:35.875 --> 01:13:38.003
Why the fuck not?

01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:42.886
We're brothers.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.048
Right?

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:04.379
How did we fuck this up?

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:08.879
Told you I wouldn't be
any good at it.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.844
How did I fuck this up?

01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:20.756
It's not over yet.

01:14:20.875 --> 01:14:24.584

We'll, uh... have you at full

01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:52.292
- Yeah, we'll see how we go.
- Yep.

01:14:52.417 --> 01:14:54.044
- Yep.
- Good one.

01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:06.377
- We need to talk.
- I thought you'd never ask.

01:15:08.375 --> 01:15:10.218
Wee-captain.

01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:14.377
And Ray
got nabbed by Customs

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:18.835
and now here we are,
on a fucking roof.

01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:25.425
- Is ii uncut?
- Pure chicken.

01:15:26.458 --> 01:15:29.792
And you're prepared
to testify in court?

01:15:29.917 --> 01:15:31.419
Yeah, I'll name 'em all'

01:15:34.042 --> 01:15:35.544
So who else knows about this?

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:41.756
Nobody. Just me and Ray.

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:44.253
And you.

01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:57.130
Hey, you've made
the right decision'

01:15:59.583 --> 01:16:01.426
You promise nothing
will happen to Ray?

01:16:01.542 --> 01:16:03.761

01:16:03.875 --> 01:16:07.755

Cunts want me dead.

You're gonna die.
You do realise that.

01:16:56.667 --> 01:16:59.386
There's only one option
where you survive.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:04.835
I take the drugs, file a report
stating it was glucose-.

01:17:04.958 --> 01:17:07.552
There's no laws about
carrying sugar in your gut.

a fuckwit...

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:52.967
What?

01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:55.256
The body? Where's the body?

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:57.924
Why isn't there a body
down there, or police?

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:01.670
'Cause the big bloke took it.

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:05.798

01:18:22.792 --> 01:18:24.294
Yeah.

01:18:24.417 --> 01:18:29.048
Oh, and this moustache
took the dead body in the car

01:18:29.167 --> 01:18:31.215
without anyone seeing him?

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:33.552
It was nighttime.

01:18:34.583 --> 01:18:37.086
Right.
And no-one heard anything?

01:18:37.208 --> 01:18:40.917

Oh, I do believe you, mate.

01:18:47.833 --> 01:18:49.676
Just show me
where the body was again?

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:51.635
Just down there, Aargh!

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:55.334

01:18:57.542 --> 01:19:00.421

01:19:02.208 --> 01:19:04.836

01:19:04.958 --> 01:19:06.585

with glucose,
