00:09.109 --> 00:11.477
When you were three years old,
you were abducted.

00:11.479 --> 00:15.080
The woman you think is your
mother is not your mother.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.148
She's your kidnapper.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.649
Your real parents
are here.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.618
Do you remember me at all?

00:19.620 --> 00:20.552
No, I'm sorry.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.420
You lose a child,

00:21.422 --> 00:23.222
but you bring home
a stranger.

00:23.224 --> 00:26.125
So your family...
you like 'em?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.059
They're total strangers,
right?

00:27.061 --> 00:29.161
But, oh, when the grandfather
hugged me,

00:29.163 --> 00:32.598
it was like this spot
in my brain just went halogen.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.366
Well, you're happy
she's back, right?

00:34.368 --> 00:37.703
Yeah, of course
I'm happy.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.939
There are things you don't know.
Things you should know.

00:40.941 --> 00:43.842
I want to do it all differently
this time, Linden.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.645

calling me "Carter."

matters for

Bring that up at
family therapy tonight.

I wanna do is spend

02:50.471 --> 02:52.704
another hour of my life
talking about Carter.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.573
That's the whole point
of family therapy.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.910
Finding Carter has made
our lives very complicated.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.111
This has been
a tough month.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.612
I'm happy she's here.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.813
We're all happy
she's here.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.983
I'd be happier
if she were <i>here.</i>

03:04.985 --> 03:07.152
I am.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.187
Come on, we don't
wanna be late.

03:08.189 --> 03:11.890
Carter,
you can't go to school
in your pajamas.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.358
Why not?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.160
What difference
does it make?

03:15.162 --> 03:16.695
Fine.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.063
You take them.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.198
Uh, no, I can't,

03:19.200 --> 03:20.799
I've got that meeting
in the city today.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.367
It's the editor
of "Vanity Fair."

03:22.369 --> 03:25.604
They're looking for someone
to do a true crime column.

03:25.606 --> 03:29.041
One like
Dominick Dunne.

03:29.043 --> 03:32.044
So you never were gonna wear
your pajamas to school.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.345
Nope.

03:33.347 --> 03:36.081
You did that
just to annoy Mom?

03:36.083 --> 03:39.418
No, I did that
to distract her.

03:39.420 --> 03:43.222
This is what
I'm doing to annoy her.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.056
Do you guys
want a ride?

03:44.058 --> 03:45.524
Do not use her as
a role model, Grant.

03:45.526 --> 03:50.395
Yeah, not when you've got
so many other great options.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.594
As you may know,
the school is reevaluating

04:22.596 --> 04:25.264
its zero tolerance
program.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.398
So, for the time being,

04:26.400 --> 04:29.067
we are reinstating
our point system.

04:29.069 --> 04:29.601
Boo.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.237
Each one of you will
receive this booklet.

04:32.239 --> 04:33.605
It's the list
of infractions

04:33.607 --> 04:34.706
and the points
you will receive

04:34.708 --> 04:35.841
as a result of
those infractions.

04:35.843 --> 04:39.044
For example, Miss Gilroy,
eating in class, one point.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.178
Please put away
that yogurt.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.214
When you have
accumulated enough points,

04:42.216 --> 04:44.216
you will begin
to lose privileges.
(hyperventilating)

04:44.218 --> 04:47.319
For example,
five points,
no pep rally.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.521
Ten points earns you
cafeteria cleanup.

04:49.523 --> 04:53.191
15 points gives you
five Saturday detention.

04:53.193 --> 04:57.763
15 points--
Mr. Sharkey.

04:57.765 --> 04:58.764
Oh, dear Lord.

04:58.766 --> 05:02.467
Oh, my God.
I think she's having
a panic attack.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.001
Yogurt.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.370
Does she want my yogurt?
She can have my yogurt?

05:05.372 --> 05:06.038
It's my mom.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.339
The last time
she saw her mom,

05:07.341 --> 05:09.341
the kidnapper mom,
was in a yogurt shop.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.542
She almost got
arrested by my dad.

05:10.544 --> 05:14.179
Take her to the office,
have her call her parents.

05:17.550 --> 05:21.086
I'll call your mom.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.159
Don't bother.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.527
Wait, so you're not...

05:28.529 --> 05:31.129
And please stop calling
Elizabeth my mom.

05:31.131 --> 05:34.333
She is...
she is not my mom.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.600
So you faked
that whole thing.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.703
Well, not the part where
I had to listen to you brag

05:37.705 --> 05:42.207
about how your dad almost
arrested the "kidnapper" mom.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.675
Please don't
refer to her as that,

05:43.677 --> 05:45.177
she is just my mom.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.278
I'm sorry.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.180
It gets confusing
sometimes.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.781
Yeah, I know,
I'm sorry.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.683
Well, thanks for
getting me out of there.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.987
So bam, we just got
a whole day off school.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.456
What do you wanna do?

05:57.458 --> 05:59.157
Gabe, I'm not spending
the day with you.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.959
Come on,
I've got my car.

06:00.961 --> 06:01.727
We can go into the city.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.229
I'll take you to see
the stairs from "The Exorcist."

06:04.231 --> 06:05.997
Gabe, I can't even
say your name

06:05.999 --> 06:10.035
without Taylor going blech
and walking out the room.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.405
If she finds out I spent
the entire day with you,

06:13.407 --> 06:15.774
she'll kill me.
How would she find out?

06:15.776 --> 06:17.576
She'll never find out.

06:24.183 --> 06:27.152
Taylor.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.755
Well, I always wondered

06:29.757 --> 06:32.357
what it would be like
to have a sister.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.960
Now I know.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.400
Who is that guy?
I see him everywhere.

06:41.402 --> 06:44.102
Ofe? You never met Ofe?

06:44.104 --> 06:44.803
Ofe?

06:44.805 --> 06:47.539
Stands for
"one freaking eyebrow."

06:47.541 --> 06:48.874
What's his real name?

06:48.876 --> 06:49.608
Nobody remembers.

06:49.610 --> 06:53.044
I don't even know
if he remembers.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.850
Okay, so what
you wanna do is
you wanna--

06:58.852 --> 06:59.818
you wanna pick
a date, okay,

06:59.820 --> 07:01.686
and then the buy-in's
gonna be ten dollars.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.888
Winner takes home
three grand.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.956
What if a year goes by,
and they don't catch her.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.193
Then we start a new pool,
and the pot doubles.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.197
Excuse me.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.099
Ow, man!
Sorry, sorry.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.467
That's my mom.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.270
I just lost a customer,
not your fault.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.372
I do blame you,
however, Gabe.

07:20.374 --> 07:22.107
I didn't know.
Oh, you knew.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.675
We decided
not to tell him.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.377
Right, that is
what we decided.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.611
Tell me what?

07:26.613 --> 07:27.779
I'm Ofe, by the way.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.515
I'm Bird, we kind of
met at that party.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.284
Remember, she's the one
that did that thing

07:32.286 --> 07:33.151
with the shot glass.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.019
Shot glass,
that was sweet.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.455
I love that, I could never--
I'm afraid of fire.

07:36.457 --> 07:39.958
Why have you got a photo
of my mom in your briefcase?

07:42.094 --> 07:43.829
This is my office.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.731
I make book, I take bets,
sporting events mostly.

07:46.733 --> 07:49.201
Anything from high school
matchups to pro ball,

07:49.203 --> 07:50.001
pretty much full service.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.471
I do straight, parlay,
teasers, sides.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.805
I calculate
my own spreads,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.640
if I may indulge in
a little humblebrag.

07:55.642 --> 07:59.211
And from time to time,
I come up with a fun
novelty pool.

07:59.213 --> 08:05.350
So you're taking bets on
the date my mom gets arrested.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.351
If it makes you
feel any better,

08:06.353 --> 08:08.620
most people are giving her
at least six months.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.188
You're an ass.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.057
I know, I'm sorry.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.425
I feel really bad.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.026
Maybe don't do the pool.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.161
I don't feel that bad.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.329
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

08:17.331 --> 08:21.266
It doesn't matter,
she promised me
she'd be back.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.701
I shouldn't
even be here.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.135
Where are you going?

08:24.137 --> 08:26.071
Somewhere I don't
have to think about

08:26.073 --> 08:28.573
how much
my life sucks now.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.909

Wow, this is

08:46.093 --> 08:47.859
A 16th birthday present
from my parents.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.327
If there had been a card,
it would've said,

08:49.329 --> 08:50.962
"We love you,
now go away."

08:50.964 --> 08:52.531

to be an art studio.

08:56.503 --> 08:57.736
instead of
Everlasting Gobstoppers.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.305
I have Everlasting
Gobstoppers.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.439
So you're an artist.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.140
(Gabe)
A great artist.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.010
She did the Alice in Wonderland
mural in the cafeteria.

09:05.012 --> 09:08.046
Really?
That's impressive.

09:08.048 --> 09:08.813
Thanks.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.936
We tried that once,

Really, did it work?

09:38.378 --> 09:41.313
Smart, judgmental
cop's kid.

09:41.315 --> 09:42.714
Help yourself.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.416
This place is
bigger than the one

09:44.418 --> 09:47.185
I used to live in
with my mom.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.555
Sorry about that
stupid pool, Carter.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.091
I'm sorry you haven't
heard from her.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.727
No chance she'll come back
to the yogurt store?

09:55.729 --> 09:56.595
No, I doubt it.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.696
Anyway, they fired me.

09:57.698 --> 09:58.930
Apparently,
people don't like

09:58.932 --> 10:00.365
to be under
police surveillance

10:00.367 --> 10:02.033
while they eat yogurt.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.302
That's fine, though,
I know she'll get in touch.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.937
I just don't know
how the FBI's

10:05.939 --> 10:08.707
got everything
but a camera up my ass.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.675
Screw the FBI.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.444
We could, actually.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.813
It wouldn't even
be that hard.
What do you mean?

10:14.815 --> 10:16.181
So they're stalking
your phone, right?

10:16.183 --> 10:18.016
In case your mom
sends you a message.

10:18.018 --> 10:18.750
So we get your mom--

10:18.752 --> 10:22.454
I mean, us pretending
to be your mom to text you.

10:22.456 --> 10:23.655
With burner phones.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.256
Cheapo phones with
prepaid minutes.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.858
You can get 'em
pretty much anywhere.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.892
Including right here.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.362
It's a side business,
I also sell glow sticks.

10:30.364 --> 10:32.030
I do very well
at parties.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.265
Okay, so what should
the message be?

10:34.267 --> 10:36.201
Something a mother
would say to a daughter.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.703
I know
what it would say.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.071
"Love you more."

10:40.073 --> 10:43.008
Love you more.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.477
(beeping sending)

10:45.479 --> 10:48.113
(beeping receiving)

10:51.984 --> 10:55.153
(Gabe)
Phase one complete.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.661
you wanted to say
to Carter.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.866
I was really angry today
when I found out that

11:07.868 --> 11:12.404
you went through my bag
and had taken my car keys.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.172
I...

11:14.174 --> 11:17.609
reacted immaturely.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.678
I went into your room,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.279
and I looked
through your closet,

11:21.281 --> 11:23.581
and I found something.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.550
I found the backpack.

11:25.552 --> 11:29.220
The one that's packed like
you're ready to run away.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.355
I can't do that again.

11:30.357 --> 11:34.426
I can't come home one day
and find out that you're gone.

11:34.428 --> 11:38.596
Please,
give me a chance.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.832
How was that,
Elizabeth?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.133
Not so bad.

11:42.135 --> 11:45.804
I've always been able
to talk to Carter

11:45.806 --> 11:48.773
when she wasn't there.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.712
(David)
If we want her
to come to therapy,

11:53.714 --> 11:56.181
we can't get mad at her
for not coming to therapy.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.650
I wasn't going to.

11:58.652 --> 11:59.517
Morning, sunshine.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.686
Did you borrow my car
or just steal it?

12:01.688 --> 12:06.157
I'm only asking
because it isn't here.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.926
Carter,
get rid of that.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.461
Your 12-year-old brother
is in the room.

12:09.463 --> 12:12.397
Oh, come on, has he never
been to a sporting event?

12:12.399 --> 12:15.166
Not many.

12:15.168 --> 12:15.934
It's a joke,
it's a toy.

12:15.936 --> 12:19.437
No, you know
very well what it is,
it's an obscenity.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.773
From, like,
the 1970s, geez.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.175
Glad I didn't bring it
to family therapy last night.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.579
No, instead, you just
decided not to show up.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.548
Kids, you're taking
the bus this morning.

12:30.550 --> 12:31.049
The bus?

12:31.051 --> 12:32.250
I was gonna take them.
I hate the bus.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.252
No, we have to
deal with this.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.354
This-- I'm a this now.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.356
The bus is starting
to look pretty good.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.090
Yeah.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.525
You can borrow
my headphones.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.359
I have headphones.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.362
Not like these.
Thanks.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.531
Look, I'm sorry,
I was with friends,

12:46.533 --> 12:47.565
and I got
a little drunk,

12:47.567 --> 12:49.467
and I thought I probably
shouldn't drive.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.869
Especially since
it was your car.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.371
(door closing)
So I got Gabe
to give me a ride.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.508
See, she was
being responsible.

12:56.510 --> 12:57.075
David...

12:57.077 --> 12:59.644
she stole my car keys
out of my purse.

12:59.646 --> 13:02.213
She got drunk,
she skipped
a therapy session

13:02.215 --> 13:03.782
that we
desperately need,

13:03.784 --> 13:05.884
and now this is
how she talks to me?

13:05.886 --> 13:09.120
How does any of this qualify
as being responsible?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.790
You're right,
it doesn't.

13:11.792 --> 13:15.660
I just want this thing

13:15.662 --> 13:17.562
out of my house.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.265
That seems kind of fair.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.100
Okay.
(horn honking)

13:22.102 --> 13:26.004
That's Gabe, I asked him
to give me a ride.

13:26.006 --> 13:30.175
It's leaving the house,
as you requested.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.144
(door opening)

13:33.146 --> 13:36.147
(door closing)

13:36.149 --> 13:38.349
She put it on my car,
didn't she?

13:38.351 --> 13:39.350
No.
No?

13:39.352 --> 13:40.418
Oh, I'm surprised.
Yeah, me too.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.888
Maybe she actually feels bad
about the whole thing.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.261
How you doing?
Fine.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.696
Really? 'Cause
you look stressed.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.299
Kyle, you don't have to
keep checking up on me.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.301
Okay, you can tell me that
we're not seeing each other,

13:56.303 --> 14:00.071
but you can't tell me
to stop caring about you.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.741
It hasn't been easy.

14:03.743 --> 14:06.578
Okay, well,
maybe this will help.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.379
Looks like Lori's been
in touch with Carter.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.715
She's been
getting text messages
from burner phones.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.117
Any idea where she is?
We can't trace 'em,

14:13.119 --> 14:14.452
but we can tell
they're local.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.688
They're local?
Yeah.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.189
Keep an eye on Carter.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.491
Yeah.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.275
Hey.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.878
Is it okay
if I tape our interview?

14:39.880 --> 14:41.479
Yeah.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.349
Sure, ask me-- okay.

14:46.819 --> 14:50.688
So you're, uh,
Carter's real mother.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.091
Elizabeth, right?
Detective Wilson.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.126
Right.

14:55.128 --> 14:58.630
I'm sorry,
Detective Wilson.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.836
Is this, uh,
are we starting?

15:04.838 --> 15:06.271
Yes.
Okay.

15:06.273 --> 15:10.308
Before we start,
I just wanna say...

15:10.310 --> 15:13.177
I really like Lori,
Carter's other mom.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.813
She is not
Carter's other mom.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.782
She is Carter's
kidnapper.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.318
Yes, I just--
I thought you should know,

15:20.320 --> 15:25.623
I have that thing where
I'm not objective.

15:30.329 --> 15:33.765
I see what
Carter means about you.

15:33.767 --> 15:34.732
Excuse me.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.101
She says
you never laugh,

15:37.103 --> 15:39.504
like, she's never heard
what you sound like

15:39.506 --> 15:41.005
when you're laughing.

15:41.007 --> 15:44.375
Not that this is funny,
this is not funny...

15:44.377 --> 15:44.976
at all.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.611
Like a funny situation,
it's not.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.048
But she says you're,
like, one of those people

15:50.050 --> 15:53.785
who brag,
"I never cry."

15:53.787 --> 15:56.087
Only with you, it's...

15:56.089 --> 15:58.856
"I never laugh."

16:02.161 --> 16:05.897
(camera beeps)
Oh, man...

16:08.567 --> 16:12.637
What else does
Carter say about me?

16:15.607 --> 16:16.574
Hey.
Hey.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.509
What's for dinner?
I'm starving.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.912
Tilapia with
ginger and garlic.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.981
Cool, as long as
it's not fish.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.983
It's fish.
Taylor,

16:24.985 --> 16:27.018
we have
our entire lives

16:27.020 --> 16:28.920
to eat fish
and steamed veggies.

16:28.922 --> 16:31.255
We have this
tiny, tiny window

16:31.257 --> 16:33.024
where we can eat
onion rings

16:33.026 --> 16:34.692
and milkshakes and...

16:34.694 --> 16:36.260
Oh, my God,
I so want onion rings

16:36.262 --> 16:37.428
and a milkshake
right now.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.063
(door closing)
Hey.

16:39.065 --> 16:40.498
What smells so good?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.599
Fish.

16:41.601 --> 16:42.700
Oh, see?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.435
Fish can never
be the answer to,

16:44.437 --> 16:45.770
"Mmm, what smells
so good?"

16:45.772 --> 16:48.006
Well, I hope we have
enough for one more

16:48.008 --> 16:50.541
because I brought home
a guest for dinner.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.310
Well, there's
plenty because

16:52.312 --> 16:54.779
I'm going out to eat.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.815
Max, what are
you doing here?

16:57.817 --> 16:59.584
Uh, Max, you should meet
the rest of the family.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.954
This is Taylor, uh,
Carter's twin sister.

17:02.956 --> 17:04.122
Hi.
Hey.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.890
And Grant-- Grant?!

17:05.892 --> 17:08.459
This is Grant,
Carter's brother.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.028
Dude.
What's up?

17:10.030 --> 17:10.661
David!

17:10.663 --> 17:11.829
Well,
he's probably working,

17:11.831 --> 17:13.331
that's my husband,
he's a writer.

17:13.333 --> 17:17.268
I invited Max to stay
for a couple of days.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.469
You did?
Yes,

17:18.471 --> 17:19.303
I thought
you'd enjoy it.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.772
You cleared it with
your folks, right?

17:20.774 --> 17:22.440
Yeah, I don't think
they believe me, though.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.242
Cops don't usually
bring me home.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.744
To their home--
they don't bring me
to their home.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.580
I'm confused, this morning
you were mad at me.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.349
No, I wouldn't
call that mad.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.283
Okay, I really would.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.285
So what, then,
she just invited you here?

17:34.287 --> 17:39.390
Yeah, you know, like,
invitation, subpoena.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.828
What's going on?
The usual.

17:43.830 --> 17:44.896
Okay, now I get it.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.431
No, you don't,
let me explain.
Yes.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.965
You didn't bring him
here for me.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.467
You brought him
here for you.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.036
You see, it's not enough
that you're already

17:52.038 --> 17:53.871
listening into
all of my phone calls

17:53.873 --> 17:55.073
and checking my emails.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.275
Now you have
to plant my friends

17:57.277 --> 17:59.510
in my home to spy on me.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.647
Come on, we're leaving.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.849
Nice meeting you all,

18:04.851 --> 18:05.516
I'm Max.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.051
David.
You know what?

18:07.053 --> 18:09.287
Now would be
the perfect opportunity

18:09.289 --> 18:11.556
to put a bug
in my room.

18:12.891 --> 18:15.093

(Gabe)
So how long
you gonna be here?

18:48.995 --> 18:49.927
Uh, not sure.

18:49.929 --> 18:54.398
Not like I brought
a lot of clean clothes.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.767
But I did bring a lot
of dirty ones.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.970
Man, I got this
fat pile of dirty dinghies

18:58.972 --> 19:00.905
in the back seat of my car,
it's stinking.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.074
Can you recommend
a good Laundromat?

19:03.076 --> 19:05.109
Max, you can do
your wash at our place.

19:05.111 --> 19:05.977
Bonus.

19:05.979 --> 19:09.213
What about school and--
you go to school, don't you?

19:09.215 --> 19:10.448
Uh, oh, yeah, um...

19:10.450 --> 19:13.284
There's been some confusion
about my grade,

19:13.286 --> 19:16.854
which grade I'm in,
so I kind of been
home schooling...

19:16.856 --> 19:18.589
without the schooling.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.457
Oh.

19:19.459 --> 19:24.162
Man, I already got
interrogated today
by her mother.

19:25.063 --> 19:25.997
His dad's also a cop.

19:25.999 --> 19:29.433
Yeah, in fact, his dad is
the guy who followed me

19:29.435 --> 19:30.668
that day I came
to visit you.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.136
Nobody will be
following Carter

19:32.138 --> 19:34.505
after my little
FBI sting.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.574
We're sending Carter
texts from burner phones

19:36.576 --> 19:39.343
to make it look like
they're coming from her mom.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.745
Oh.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.914
Uh-huh, okay.

19:42.916 --> 19:43.848
How's that going?

19:43.850 --> 19:46.217
It's phase two,
now we find out.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.052
I need a new phone.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.288
Last one, then you
gotta start paying,

19:50.290 --> 19:51.289
I'm not Amazon.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.157
I get it, I get it.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.193
You all free tomorrow
after school?

19:55.195 --> 19:56.561
Yup.
Yup.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.029
Always.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.263
Good.

19:59.265 --> 20:00.231
What are you writing?

20:00.233 --> 20:01.933
Don't worry,
I got this,

20:01.935 --> 20:02.767
I know how cops work.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.636
They like to solve things,
figure stuff out.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.572
Like Batman
and The Riddler.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.541
Yeah, but you can't give 'em
anything that hard.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.343
(chuckles)

20:14.213 --> 20:15.346
Captain?

20:15.348 --> 20:17.882
Detective Wilson,
this is Grady Smith

20:17.884 --> 20:19.517
from the FBI felony
kidnapping unit.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.319
Kidnapping unit,
what's happening?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.887
Carter's been getting
a series of texts

20:22.889 --> 20:23.721
from untraceable
numbers.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.591
We think it could be
coming from her kidnapper.

20:27.559 --> 20:31.028
Now one by one,
they don't make any sense.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.764
Then...

20:33.766 --> 20:35.967
I line 'em up.

20:35.969 --> 20:37.268
First word
of every sentence.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.403
Mm-hmm, food court mall,
4:00 p.m. today.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.739
It's a pretty basic code,
we're obviously not dealing

20:41.741 --> 20:43.407
with a criminal
mastermind here.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.675
All sent within
the last 24 hours.

20:44.677 --> 20:45.776
We got undercovers
in place already.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.912
We've already got eyes on
everyone going in or out.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.213
Captain,
I have to be there.
Detective,

20:49.215 --> 20:51.115
we need you to keep
your daughter in your sight.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.251
I can get my husband
to pick her up--
I'm giving

20:53.253 --> 20:54.585
that job to you.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.454
I'll be there.
And I'll be there.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.656
We've got this covered,
I assure you.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.091
We will catch this woman.

21:00.093 --> 21:03.327
You just take care
of your daughter.

21:06.131 --> 21:09.634
Kyle, help me, please,
I have to be there.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.569
You heard
what the Captain said.

21:11.571 --> 21:16.707
Hey, I'm not gonna
let you lose Carter again.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.226
Hey.

21:35.228 --> 21:36.527
Where's Carter?

21:36.529 --> 21:39.697
You don't actually think she's
been coming to school, do you?

21:39.699 --> 21:40.464
What do you mean?

21:40.466 --> 21:41.966
She's got everyone
thinking she's got

21:41.968 --> 21:43.901
post traumatic
stress disorder,

21:43.903 --> 21:45.169

22:32.485 --> 22:36.053
Yeah, I couldn't find
any peanut butter, though.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.923
She keeps it
in the fridge.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.125
That's weird.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.927
Yeah.

I know, I'm sorry,
Captain, I'm sorry,

What is it?
Okay,

24:22.094 --> 24:23.360
so Elizabeth thinks
I'm meeting my mom

24:23.362 --> 24:26.564
in this food court,
and she's looking around.

24:26.566 --> 24:29.400
And she's looking
around and...

24:29.402 --> 24:32.703
(laughing)

24:32.705 --> 24:34.405
Am I right, isn't
that the best thing

24:36.742 --> 24:37.842
look at her face,
look at her face,

24:37.844 --> 24:41.078
look at her face...
(laughing)

24:41.080 --> 24:42.413
She looks--
she looks so sad.

24:42.415 --> 24:43.380
Oh, my God, Max,
don't tell me

24:43.382 --> 24:46.884
you feel sorry for her.
A little, look at her.

24:48.453 --> 24:50.788
Max...

24:50.790 --> 24:52.223
This woman--

24:52.225 --> 24:54.592
the whole entire
reason you're even here

24:54.594 --> 24:58.262
is because she is
obsessed with the idea

24:58.264 --> 25:01.265
of putting
my mom in jail.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.301
She got me back,
okay, I am here.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.870
Why don't you make
that your focus,

25:05.872 --> 25:08.005
or how about just
being happy with that

25:08.007 --> 25:11.542
and leaving my mom alone?

25:11.544 --> 25:13.377
I love my mom, okay?

25:13.379 --> 25:17.681
More than anyone or anything
in the whole entire world.

25:17.683 --> 25:21.151
And I live with someone who
would kill her if she could.

25:21.153 --> 25:24.655
Which she can't,
but you know what
she can do?

25:24.657 --> 25:27.224
She can put her
in jail for 20 years.

25:27.226 --> 25:28.893
And that is what
Elizabeth lives for.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.795
That is why she was in the food
court in the first place.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.430
She knows how much
it would hurt me,

25:33.432 --> 25:35.466
and she couldn't
care less.

25:35.468 --> 25:39.003
Hey, look,
I'm sorry, I didn't--

25:39.005 --> 25:40.471
I didn't think
to see it like that.

25:40.473 --> 25:44.108
Yeah, well,
that's the problem,
nobody does.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.413
So then
you gotta tell them.

25:49.415 --> 25:50.648
When, how?

25:50.650 --> 25:52.483
Every conversation
I've ever had with Elizabeth

25:52.485 --> 25:55.886
is her telling me
what I've done wrong.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.088
My opinion does not
matter to her.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.190
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.926
I mean, when she was
interrogating me,

26:01.928 --> 26:06.297
she never asked me
a single question about Lori.

26:06.299 --> 26:10.568
All she wanted to do
was talk about you.

26:13.104 --> 26:16.807
So, uh,
how does this work?

26:16.809 --> 26:18.409
This is
a safe space.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.110
We do only
two things in here.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.979
We speak,
and we listen.

26:21.981 --> 26:22.947
Would you like
to go first?

26:22.949 --> 26:25.382
I didn't see
that coming.

26:25.384 --> 26:28.319
And when we speak,
we do it so everyone can hear.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.854
You can go first.
No, clearly the doctor

26:30.856 --> 26:32.590
finds you much more
fascinating than me.

26:32.592 --> 26:35.392
The only fascinating thing about
me is that I'm your sister.

26:35.394 --> 26:39.129
Taylor, the only thing
fascinating about me

26:39.131 --> 26:39.964
is that I was abducted.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.099
That's the only thing
anyone even really

26:42.101 --> 26:43.767
knows about me
or cares about.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.836
What would you
like us to know?

26:45.838 --> 26:48.639
Well, I'm trying to
figure that out myself.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.408
Can you talk
a little more about that?

26:51.410 --> 26:57.615
Well, it's-- it's hard
because...

26:57.617 --> 27:00.718
because I have to do it
with everyone watching me.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.087
I feel like some elephant
who accidentally

27:03.089 --> 27:05.923
got assigned to the
penguin house, you know?

27:05.925 --> 27:07.891
It's so obvious that
I'm an elephant.

27:07.893 --> 27:09.159
But people
keep coming up to me

27:09.161 --> 27:10.260
with a clipboard
and saying,

27:10.262 --> 27:12.796
"Hmm, you know, according
to this, you're, uh,

27:12.798 --> 27:14.798
you're actually a penguin."

27:14.966 --> 27:18.502
Actually, I also feel like
that except in my version,

27:18.504 --> 27:21.271
I'm an armadillo
and they're giraffes.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.807
At least, the penguins
can see the elephant

27:23.809 --> 27:25.643
but they don't even
know I'm down there.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.479
I know you're down there.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.781
Elizabeth,
you've been very quiet.

27:30.783 --> 27:34.051
Uh, it's just...
it's just hard to hear

27:34.053 --> 27:37.721
what terrible
parents we've been.

27:37.723 --> 27:40.357
Not him, you.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.892
What has he done
that I haven't?

27:41.894 --> 27:44.928
Well, for starters, he's
never lied to my face.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.096
He's not spying on me,

27:46.098 --> 27:47.731
he's not recording
everything I say.

27:47.733 --> 27:51.035
And with him,
I don't have to be

27:51.037 --> 27:52.603
in a room like this
for him to listen to me.

27:52.605 --> 27:57.307
I asked him not to write that
book, "Finding Carter,"

27:57.309 --> 27:59.710
and he's not.

27:59.712 --> 28:03.213
Do you have to do that,
rub it in my face?

28:03.215 --> 28:04.815
That wasn't even about you,

28:04.817 --> 28:05.783
that was about me and him.

28:05.785 --> 28:09.219
I've been married to this man
for 17 years, Carter.

28:09.221 --> 28:12.690
You just met him. Yes,
it was between you and him.

28:12.692 --> 28:15.025
But it was also
between him and me.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.927
Let's open the
discussion back up.

28:16.929 --> 28:20.698
I'd like to go back to what you
were saying to your mother.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.666
Oh, please don't
use that word.

28:22.668 --> 28:24.101
My mother is not here.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.603
I can't see her,
I can't talk to her.

28:26.605 --> 28:30.941
She is not my mother, and she
will never be my mother

28:30.943 --> 28:36.613
because she is the person
who is hunting my mother.

28:41.519 --> 28:43.954
(knocking on door)

28:43.956 --> 28:45.556
Hey, armadillo.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.758
Hey, elephant.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.727
Well, I guess
that'll teach you

28:49.729 --> 28:53.130
to invite me to
family therapy again.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.364
I think it could help.

28:54.366 --> 28:55.799
Well, I can tell you
that kind of stuff

28:55.801 --> 28:57.067
is a lot more fun
when you're high.

28:57.069 --> 29:01.004
Taylor's right, don't
use me as a role model.

29:01.006 --> 29:05.008
Last time, Ma-- Elizabeth

29:05.010 --> 29:07.211
made this whole speech
to your empty chair.

29:07.213 --> 29:11.381
She described the day she came
home and you weren't there.

29:11.383 --> 29:14.451
It sounded pretty...
horrible.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.787
Yeah, I'm sure it did.

29:16.789 --> 29:17.621
And how she's afraid

29:17.623 --> 29:20.057
she'll have to
go through it again.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.693
Will she?

29:22.695 --> 29:23.560
Will I?

29:23.562 --> 29:28.232
Grant... I don't know.

29:28.234 --> 29:29.800
I would tell you
if I did.

29:29.802 --> 29:32.603
But the not knowing
is just as hard for me.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.705
But you wanna go, right?

29:34.707 --> 29:37.174
If Lori showed up.

29:37.176 --> 29:38.442
She's my mother.

29:38.444 --> 29:41.011
And I'm your brother and
Taylor's your sister,

29:41.013 --> 29:41.979
and you have a dad now.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.480
That's not enough
for you, is it?

29:43.482 --> 29:46.350
You'd still leave us.

29:46.352 --> 29:49.987
I can't answer that.

29:49.989 --> 29:53.023
You already did.

29:53.025 --> 29:56.760
She found your escape
backpack-- Elizabeth.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.095
What?

30:04.536 --> 30:05.502
It's gone.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.637
Carter wait.
She took it.

30:06.639 --> 30:07.604
No, no, she didn't.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.273
This woman is insane.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.841
She is insane.

30:10.843 --> 30:13.243
She tells me she is
scared I'll leave,

30:13.245 --> 30:16.446
but then she does absolutely
everything in her power

30:16.448 --> 30:17.948
to push me away from her.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.082
She lies to me,

30:19.084 --> 30:21.752
she spies on me,
she steals from me.

30:21.754 --> 30:26.490
She has absolutely no idea what
this might be like for me,

30:26.492 --> 30:29.960
and she is deliberately
trying to make me mad.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.429
Well, guess what,
it worked, I'm mad.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.399
And she is not gonna
like me when I'm mad.

30:41.806 --> 30:43.073
but not with the
cooking or anything.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.341
Or maybe with the cooking,
actually.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.110
But I'll just start being
really like nice and polite,

30:47.112 --> 30:48.245
like I really
want this to work.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.746
And then I'll just
start doing little things

30:49.748 --> 30:52.082
like hiding her stuff,
like her reading glasses

30:52.084 --> 30:56.119
or her driver's license or,
ooh, her detective shield.

30:56.121 --> 30:56.753
And then I'll, um,

30:56.755 --> 30:59.690
I'll just start cutting
little holes in her clothes.

30:59.692 --> 31:00.457
Carter?

31:00.459 --> 31:01.291
Have you ever
heard the saying

31:01.293 --> 31:04.661
that holding on to anger
is like swallowing poison

31:04.663 --> 31:07.064
and hoping the other
person will die?...

31:07.066 --> 31:07.798
No.

31:07.800 --> 31:09.399
But you heard it
right now.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.268
When I said it.

31:11.270 --> 31:11.835
What's your point?

31:11.837 --> 31:14.071
Okay, well, how about
instead of thinking

31:14.073 --> 31:16.373
about ways to make
Elizabeth miserable,

31:16.375 --> 31:18.075
you find a way
to make you happy.

31:18.077 --> 31:21.411
Why take the long way when
there's a shortcut?

31:21.413 --> 31:24.147
I'm just saying.

31:26.918 --> 31:28.151
Molly?
You ever tried it?

31:28.153 --> 31:30.554
No.
I did it, once--
it was not for me.

31:30.556 --> 31:33.724
I was in much too good a mood
for much too long a time.

31:33.726 --> 31:34.691
While you,
on the other hand,

31:34.693 --> 31:37.594
have been unhappy
for a while now.

31:37.596 --> 31:38.996
I just think you
could use a vacation.

31:38.998 --> 31:42.466
And don't worry,
it's very pure and very safe.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.968
Yes, we get it
from this guy, Crash.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.370
If drug dealers
were on Yelp,

31:46.372 --> 31:49.373
he would be getting
five stars.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.909
You know,
for drug dealers.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.810
That's a potentially
huge idea.

Technically, a coma.
