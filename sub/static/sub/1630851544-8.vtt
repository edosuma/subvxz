08:18.831 --> 08:19.866
the word "escoderme"?

08:19.932 --> 08:20.867
Esconderme.
Means, uh, "hide me."

08:20.933 --> 08:22.168
Pretty odd thing

08:22.235 --> 08:24.070

"call the cops."

08:22.235 --> 08:24.070
It is,

08:24.136 --> 08:25.805
unless she's undocumented.

Hey, and before you

08:46.893 --> 08:48.794
I know my mom was being
a little...

08:48.861 --> 08:50.296
Pushy?

08:50.363 --> 08:53.266
I was gonna say
a little overcurious, but okay.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.167
I swear she means well.

08:55.234 --> 08:58.004
See, my sister Winnie
swore off kids

08:58.070 --> 08:59.872
when she moved to Vegas,
and my mama's spotlight

08:59.939 --> 09:01.641
has been on me ever since.
Nichelle, we don't have

It's too soon, and I get that.

09:04.110 --> 09:07.546
Hondo, please,
I just need

09:07.613 --> 09:09.148
to say this.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.851
Your mom didn't make me
uncomfortable.

09:11.918 --> 09:14.220
I made me uncomfortable.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.857
Because I haven't been
completely honest with you.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.859
Okay.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.193
Three years ago,

09:21.260 --> 09:23.195
I started thinking
about adoption.

09:23.262 --> 09:27.767
I contacted an agency, filled
out a thousand forms...

09:27.833 --> 09:29.168
I mean,
I knew it was a long shot--

09:29.235 --> 09:31.570
a single woman living
on a nonprofit salary

09:31.637 --> 09:32.805
didn't exactly make me

09:32.872 --> 09:35.341
desirable to most
birth mothers.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.809
(sighs):
Well...

09:36.876 --> 09:40.713
a week ago, the agency called.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.015
There's a pregnant teen
in Riverside

09:43.082 --> 09:46.085
who wants me to be
her baby's mother.

09:47.186 --> 09:49.088
Me.

09:49.155 --> 09:53.626
So...

09:49.155 --> 09:53.626
I mean, if this is something
you really want, I...

09:53.693 --> 09:55.161
I'm happy for you.

09:55.227 --> 09:58.097
But I'm not sure
what it would mean for...

09:55.227 --> 09:58.097
Us.

09:58.164 --> 10:01.033
I know.
The timing isn't perfect.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.102
I honestly didn't expect
this to ever happen.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.838
I've kind of
been in shock.

10:05.905 --> 10:08.240
I just wanted to be honest.

10:05.905 --> 10:08.240
Honest?

10:08.975 --> 10:11.644
You could have told me this
before.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.347
When do you have
to let them know?

10:14.413 --> 10:17.917
I have to give the agency
an answer by tomorrow.

10:17.984 --> 10:20.152
Are you looking for my okay,

10:20.219 --> 10:22.922
or have you already made
your decision?

10:23.589 --> 10:25.858
I've wanted this
for a long time.

10:25.925 --> 10:27.860
Before I ever met you.

10:27.927 --> 10:31.030
But if I do this, I need
to know where you stand.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.132
Where we stand.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.237
Why don't we talk about this
when my shift is over?

10:38.304 --> 10:39.705
Sure.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.407
Call me when you're done.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.975
Okay.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.753
What do we got?

10:51.951 --> 10:53.753
Connected with Vice.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.155
No intel linking our suspects
to a trafficking ring

10:56.222 --> 10:58.391
based out of Gardena
or the South Bay area.

10:58.457 --> 11:00.326
Well, that puts us
back to square one.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.028
Did we get ahold of GND?

11:02.094 --> 11:03.963
A detective's
on his way over now.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.963
Good.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.965
Let's hope we get a handle
on the situation then.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.235
Luca, come with me.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.942
Well, I'll be damned.
Marcos?

11:17.009 --> 11:18.978
He say why he's here?

11:17.009 --> 11:18.978
Not a clue.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.813
He asked for you.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.015
Marcos, man,
what's up?

11:24.850 --> 11:26.919
I ain't here
to talk to you.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.055
So you can go ahead
and bounce now.

11:29.121 --> 11:30.856
Someone with your record, sport?

11:30.923 --> 11:32.858
Until I know the nature
of your business,

11:32.925 --> 11:35.127
you get two cops
for the price of one.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.297
(quietly):
Uh, Commander?

11:38.364 --> 11:41.133
This won't take long.
Just a few minutes, okay?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.169
Well, if that's the way
you want it, Luca...

11:44.270 --> 11:46.005
...sure.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.744
All right, man, so talk to me.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.012
What's going on?

11:51.811 --> 11:53.012
That shooting

11:53.079 --> 11:54.880
at the liquor store,
at Gardena Boulevard?

11:54.947 --> 11:56.248
Yeah.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.248
About the missing girl.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.084
I got something you're
gonna want to hear.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.385
What makes you think
there's a girl missing?

11:59.452 --> 12:01.287
Come on, man, that's how
you want to play this?

12:01.353 --> 12:03.189
I got a friend in the
car willing to talk.

12:03.255 --> 12:04.490
All right, then bring him in.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.125
Only way she's talking
is outside.

12:06.192 --> 12:06.892
And why is that?

12:06.959 --> 12:08.294
Look, what aren't
you telling me?

12:08.360 --> 12:10.096
This friend
is like family to me.

12:10.162 --> 12:13.365
She needs help,
and I'm out of options.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.000
MARCOS:
Is this really necessary?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.735
Yeah, this is.
Your friend's so nervous

12:16.802 --> 12:18.137
about talking inside,

12:18.204 --> 12:19.738
maybe another woman
will put her at ease.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.307
Whatever you say.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.210
Mama Pina, these here

12:24.276 --> 12:26.345
are Officers Dominique Luca
and...?

12:26.412 --> 12:27.480
Chris Alonso.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.181
They're here to help, okay?

12:29.248 --> 12:31.283
(speaks Spanish)

12:34.854 --> 12:36.355
LUCA:
Miss--
I mean Mama Pina--

12:36.422 --> 12:38.224
I'm gonna show you a video,

12:38.290 --> 12:41.026
and can you tell me
if you recognize this woman?

12:44.864 --> 12:47.766
(groans):
Oh. That's Jenni Moreno.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.001
How do you know her?

12:49.068 --> 12:51.337
Uh, she fled Honduras
some time ago,

12:51.403 --> 12:53.372
and she's been staying with me

12:53.439 --> 12:54.507
for about three weeks.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.509
Are you family?

12:54.573 --> 12:56.509
No.

12:56.575 --> 12:59.111
Not by blood, anyway.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.249
I open my home

13:03.315 --> 13:08.053
to undocumented women
escaping bad situations.

13:08.888 --> 13:11.223
What was Jenni's situation?

13:08.888 --> 13:11.223
Back home

13:11.290 --> 13:13.292
she was kidnapped
by a local gang,

13:13.359 --> 13:16.128
and they forced her
to become a drug mule.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.130
Somehow she escaped,

13:18.197 --> 13:21.066
and by the grace of God,
she found her way here.

13:21.133 --> 13:24.570
(sighs):
She's only 21 years old...

13:24.637 --> 13:27.473
and already on her ninth life.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.176
Did Jenni ever mention
the name of the gang she fled?

13:30.242 --> 13:31.510
No.

13:31.577 --> 13:34.847
She was afraid that it
would somehow get back to them.

13:39.585 --> 13:43.022
Hey. This is Detective Rios
with Gangs and Narcotics.

13:43.088 --> 13:44.857
Sergeant Harrelson.

13:43.088 --> 13:44.857
Good to meet you, Sergeant.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.158
Looks like your team's theory

13:46.225 --> 13:48.294
about Carlos Ochoa's
branding mark holds water.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.428
"RC" stands

13:49.495 --> 13:51.096
for Rebeldes Centrales.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.998
Central Rebels.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.998
It's a new street gang

13:53.065 --> 13:54.600
based out of San Pedro Sula
in Honduras.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.936
Popped up on GND's radar
about a year ago.

13:57.002 --> 14:00.072
Meet the ringleader,
Ignacio Cuevas.

14:00.139 --> 14:02.141
HONDO:
Pretty young to be a boss.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.542
RIOS:
Don't let the baby face
fool you.

14:03.609 --> 14:05.311
He's just as ruthless

14:05.377 --> 14:07.246
and relentless as his elders.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.246
When you first
caught wind

14:07.313 --> 14:09.582
of the RCs last year,
was Cuevas trying to establish

14:09.648 --> 14:11.183
some sort of L.A. presence?

14:11.250 --> 14:13.018
Tried and failed.
ICE deported him

14:13.085 --> 14:14.920
for entering the U.S.
with false docs.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.622
Drug trafficking--
that's his main vice?

14:16.689 --> 14:18.991
Drugs, arms and people,
among other things.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.859
It doesn't matter what it is,

14:20.926 --> 14:22.928
as long as it turns a profit
and turns it fast.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.196
Zero code of honor.

14:24.263 --> 14:26.065
Missing victim is
21-year-old Jenni Moreno,

14:26.131 --> 14:27.333
undocumented from Honduras.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.301
She fled a local gang
that forced her

14:29.368 --> 14:30.536
into becoming a drug mule.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.471
Detective Rios here
just ID'd that gang:

14:32.538 --> 14:34.039
Rebeldes Centrales.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.575
Initials RC.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.575
It's a new crew
headed by this guy:

14:36.642 --> 14:40.279
Ignacio Cuevas.

14:36.642 --> 14:40.279
Ignacio went this far
to track down Jenni Moreno--

14:40.346 --> 14:42.348
he's probably after
some twisted retribution.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.316
For a young punk
still fairly new in the game,

14:44.383 --> 14:46.552
one of his mules going AWOL
ain't a good look.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.987
Yeah, it makes him look weak.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.221
Easy for the competition
to dismiss him.

14:49.288 --> 14:51.090
He probably wants Jenni
back in Honduras

14:51.156 --> 14:52.958
to make an example of her--
keeps his reputation intact

14:53.025 --> 14:54.994
and the rest of his drug mules
in line.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.962
Which means it won't be long
before they move her back

14:57.029 --> 14:58.664
across the border.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.664
As soon as I got your inquiry,

14:58.731 --> 15:00.266
I checked all the entry ports--
no sign

15:00.332 --> 15:02.234
Ignacio's entered the U.S.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.234
That doesn't mean

15:02.301 --> 15:03.302
he's not here.

15:03.369 --> 15:04.603
Let's put out a BOLO.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.438
We find Ignacio,

15:04.670 --> 15:06.438
we find Jenni.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.438
I'm on it.

15:06.505 --> 15:07.973
I'll talk to my CI,

15:08.040 --> 15:09.308
find out if there's any
buzz on the street.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.310
HONDO:
Thanks, Detective.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.310
You got it.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.212
Jenni was staying
at a safe house in Gardena.

15:13.279 --> 15:15.481
A friend of Luca's neighbor
runs it at her personal home.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.683
All right, grab Luca.
The two of you head down there,

15:17.750 --> 15:20.152
see what you can find.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.290
(sobs)

16:34.593 --> 16:37.363
(quiet sobbing)

16:45.437 --> 16:48.240
(dog barking in distance)

17:00.119 --> 17:02.721
Can, uh, can we come in?

17:10.729 --> 17:13.232
(door closes)

17:13.298 --> 17:14.133
Look, what's the problem?

17:14.199 --> 17:16.201
Y'all look like po-po,
that's the problem.

17:16.268 --> 17:18.370
Last people these women trust
are cops.

17:18.437 --> 17:20.406
Thought you know better
than to show up like that.

17:20.472 --> 17:21.573
Well, I thought
you'd assure them

17:21.640 --> 17:23.108
that we're here
in good faith.

17:23.175 --> 17:26.111
For them, cops and good
faith don't go together.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.147
Maybe we can convince them
otherwise.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.592
LUCA:
Ask them about any names

17:40.659 --> 17:42.261
Jenni might have mentioned.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.444
I was the last one
to see her.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.212
What happened?

17:58.510 --> 18:00.212
We had planned

18:00.279 --> 18:02.347
to meet up
to take the bus home together,

18:02.414 --> 18:04.183
but I was running late.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.618
I know she was probably waiting
for me when...

18:06.685 --> 18:08.320
It's okay.
What did she say?

18:08.387 --> 18:09.855
(tires screech)

18:14.259 --> 18:18.163
That matches the Chrysler
from the liquor store.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.132
Look, keep that piece
where it belongs.

18:20.199 --> 18:21.834
Put it back.

18:20.199 --> 18:21.834
Get everyone to hide.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.635
Stay low and stay quiet.

18:23.702 --> 18:24.736
Come on. Come on.

18:24.803 --> 18:27.272
Let's go. Come on.

18:24.803 --> 18:27.272
Okay, okay.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.375
(rings doorbell)

18:36.849 --> 18:39.218
(men speaking Spanish)

18:44.223 --> 18:46.391
I'll cover your
four side. Go.

18:56.268 --> 18:57.703
LAPD! Hands up!

18:57.769 --> 18:59.838
Drop your weapon!
Turn around!

18:57.769 --> 18:59.838
CHRIS: On your knees!

18:59.905 --> 19:01.874
Hands behind your back!

18:59.905 --> 19:01.874
Turn around!
Hand behind your back! Now!

19:01.940 --> 19:04.243
Do not move. Do not move.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.278
Going hands-on.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.278
Okay, go.

19:06.345 --> 19:07.513
Hey!

19:20.392 --> 19:21.660
(gunshot)

19:22.261 --> 19:24.863
Hands behind your back!

19:22.261 --> 19:24.863
(groaning)

19:36.542 --> 19:39.912
(indistinct radio transmission,
chatter)

19:42.581 --> 19:44.249
Hey.

19:44.316 --> 19:45.484
Hey.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.753
Look, I can't shake
the feeling

19:47.819 --> 19:49.721
that there's something
you're still not telling me.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.857
Okay? Rebeldes Centrales
trying to stake a claim

19:51.924 --> 19:54.860
in the L.A. street game
means competition for your crew.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.329
What? Are you for
real right now?

19:57.396 --> 19:59.197
You really think I
had something to do

19:59.264 --> 20:01.199
with these fools
rolling up here?

19:59.264 --> 20:01.199
No. You know why?

20:01.266 --> 20:02.701
I don't think
you'd be that stupid.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.203
But right now
the optics also don't look good.

20:05.270 --> 20:07.573
Optics, huh?

20:07.639 --> 20:09.374
In a way, you're right.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.777
Me and you working together
ain't no good look.

20:11.843 --> 20:14.212
Never will be.

20:20.619 --> 20:23.388
(quiet background chatter)

20:23.455 --> 20:25.390
The hell happened here?

20:25.457 --> 20:26.925
Sir, there was no way
of us knowing

20:26.992 --> 20:28.493
Ignacio's guys would show up.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.329
Would have been a lot worse
if you hadn't been here.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.496
Our chances
of finding Jenni Moreno

20:31.563 --> 20:32.798
are getting slimmer by the hour.

20:32.864 --> 20:33.832
The RCs
already have her.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.467
Why come here?

20:35.534 --> 20:37.502
None of the other women
are associated with them.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.504
Well, Jenni was a drug mule,
so say she had their product

20:39.571 --> 20:42.507
when she escaped.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.507
Then it makes sense
why they'd show up here.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.643
Do you think Jenni intentionally
stole her boss's drugs?

20:44.710 --> 20:46.812
I don't know about intentionally
but it's a possibility.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.916
Mrs., um...

20:50.983 --> 20:52.918
It's Mama Pina.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.918
Okay, then.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.621
Mama Pina, do you have
any reason to believe

20:55.687 --> 20:58.523
that Jenni would have something
here that this gang would want?

20:58.590 --> 21:01.293
By "something," do
you mean narcotics?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.561
Mm, yeah.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.396
I don't believe so.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.396
Is that a yes

21:04.463 --> 21:06.798
or a no, ma'am?

21:04.463 --> 21:06.798
I don't
strip-search

21:06.865 --> 21:09.635
these women
and conduct daily cell checks.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.470
But it is your house.

21:11.536 --> 21:12.704
You should know
what's going on in here.

21:12.771 --> 21:17.309
Before these women
came here, no inch

21:17.376 --> 21:19.378
of their body
belonged to them.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.279
I refuse to repeat that trauma.

21:21.346 --> 21:22.381
And so do we.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.615
Now, if you have any idea

21:23.682 --> 21:25.350
what they want
or where it might be,

21:25.417 --> 21:26.685
I promise you,

21:26.752 --> 21:27.686
whatever you tell us

21:27.753 --> 21:29.855
won't jeopardize you
or the others.

21:29.921 --> 21:31.623
Mrs. Sosa, we're trying to help.

21:31.690 --> 21:34.626
Holding back information is only
gonna put Jenni in more danger.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.428
Are you ready
to help us help you?

21:36.495 --> 21:37.996
Or would you rather we
just start searching your house?

21:38.063 --> 21:39.531
Deacon, back off.

21:39.598 --> 21:42.300
None of you are really

21:42.367 --> 21:43.969
on our side.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.772
Do what you need to do...
Officer.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.073
Excuse me.

21:55.447 --> 21:57.749
(indistinct radio transmission)

21:57.816 --> 21:59.317
(sighs)

21:59.384 --> 22:01.887
I'm sorry about that.

22:01.953 --> 22:04.890
We want to find Jenni
as much as you do.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.959
We're on the same side.

22:08.026 --> 22:10.696
I'd really love to believe you.

22:11.329 --> 22:15.634
I know it's really hard for you
to trust someone like me,

22:15.701 --> 22:17.636
someone in uniform...

22:17.703 --> 22:20.038
but please try.

22:20.105 --> 22:23.975
Seems to me that that
uniform is wearing you

22:24.042 --> 22:26.912
instead of you wearing it.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.885
SWAT won't compromise
the location

22:33.952 --> 22:36.922
of your safe house to anyone,
especially ICE.

22:38.757 --> 22:42.494
Jenni wouldn't be the
first woman I've lost.

22:43.795 --> 22:45.597
(sighs heavily):
Oh...

22:47.199 --> 22:48.967
I'm sorry.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.503
Mama Pina,

22:51.570 --> 22:53.605
what you said back there

22:53.672 --> 22:56.508
about these women's bodies...
if we don't work together,

22:56.575 --> 23:01.546
that nightmare will be
Jenni's reality again, or worse.

23:06.485 --> 23:07.853
(sighs)

23:09.821 --> 23:11.923
This is her bed.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.593
May I?

23:12.891 --> 23:14.593
Yeah.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.436
Is there a problem?

23:24.503 --> 23:26.772
Uh, she had a backpack.

23:26.838 --> 23:27.873
It's gone.

23:27.939 --> 23:30.509
Did she have it
with her yesterday?

23:30.575 --> 23:32.677
No. It was here.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.146
Who does she share
the room with?

23:34.212 --> 23:35.747
Vera.

23:37.949 --> 23:39.851
(tires screech)

23:56.201 --> 23:58.436
(tires squeal)

23:59.271 --> 24:01.540
They're about to bring Javier
into interrogation.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.141
Great. I'll grab Hondo.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.843
What's your problem?

24:04.910 --> 24:06.745
At the safe house,

24:06.812 --> 24:08.446
why'd you come at Mama Pina
like that?

24:08.513 --> 24:09.748
I was questioning her.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.149
No, you were accusing her.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.149
Chris, calm down.

24:11.216 --> 24:12.617
You stay out of this.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.220
Listen, I'm sorry
you saw it that way,

24:15.287 --> 24:16.888
but I was doing my job.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.890
The one where we ask witnesses
and potential suspects

24:18.957 --> 24:20.725
the hard questions.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.725
Potential suspects?

24:20.792 --> 24:22.227
You think
she's hiding something?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.829
Those are your words, not mine.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.664
Let's just leave it
at that, huh?

24:25.730 --> 24:29.100
No. I want to
hear you say it.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.635
Say what?

24:30.702 --> 24:33.238
Come on, Chris, whether
you want to admit it or not,

24:33.305 --> 24:35.740
Mrs. Sosa is doing those women
more harm than good.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.740
How's that?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.909
What if you and Luca
hadn't been there? Huh?

24:37.976 --> 24:40.011
Then what happens? At best,

24:40.078 --> 24:41.580
she's a vigilante.
And at worst...

24:41.646 --> 24:43.014
At worst, a criminal?

24:43.081 --> 24:45.483
Do you have any clue the
sacrifice that lady makes

24:45.550 --> 24:46.985
on a daily basis
just so young women

24:47.052 --> 24:49.154
fleeing oppression and violence
get a chance?

24:49.221 --> 24:51.590
Those young women have
no legal standing

24:51.656 --> 24:52.891
living under her roof,
all right?

24:52.958 --> 24:54.659
So without it,
they're just sitting ducks.

24:54.726 --> 24:56.561
They could be deported
at the drop of a hat,

24:56.628 --> 24:57.963
sent back to the very danger
they're fleeing.

24:58.029 --> 25:00.498
You're right. They should go
through the proper channels,

25:00.565 --> 25:01.800
like sweating it out
in detention centers

25:01.867 --> 25:03.535
where they'll
probably endure

25:03.602 --> 25:05.203
the same abuses they fled!

25:05.270 --> 25:06.972
And maybe
by the time they're 40,

25:07.038 --> 25:09.274
be given permission to be
in this country.

25:07.038 --> 25:09.274
Hey,

25:09.341 --> 25:10.742
I'm not saying
the process isn't flawed,

25:10.809 --> 25:11.576
but it's a process.

25:11.643 --> 25:13.612
You don't get
to just choose which law

25:13.678 --> 25:15.146
you feel like breaking.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.146
Wow,

25:15.213 --> 25:16.681
it must be so nice
throwing stones

25:16.748 --> 25:18.283
perched up in your tidy corner
of the world.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.151
Hey, that's enough.

25:20.218 --> 25:23.822
Right now I don't give a damn
about either of your politics.

25:23.889 --> 25:26.124
We got a young woman's life
hanging in the balance, period.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.692
So get your anger
in check

25:27.759 --> 25:29.160
and your priorities
straight.

25:29.227 --> 25:30.762
Chris, you go
check in with Luca.

25:30.829 --> 25:32.697
Deacon, you're with me
in interrogation, right now.

25:33.331 --> 25:35.000
Hey, Chris, hold up.

25:35.066 --> 25:37.202
Let's get some air, yeah?

25:35.066 --> 25:37.202
I don't need a lecture.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.670
Don't plan on giving one.

25:38.737 --> 25:40.906
Please, stay out of my
way right now, okay?

25:44.009 --> 25:45.944
Got a little carried away
back there. Sorry.

25:46.011 --> 25:48.246
Any hits on the BOLO
we put out for Ignacio?

25:48.313 --> 25:50.782
Not yet. I reached out
to ICE again--

25:50.849 --> 25:52.183
radio silence.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.052
Sounds about right.

25:54.119 --> 25:57.022
We know you were after the drugs
that Jenni stole from your boss.

25:57.088 --> 25:58.556
We got to them before you did.

25:58.623 --> 26:00.692
Sitting in our evidence locker
as we speak.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.560
The same evidence
the D.A. will use

26:02.627 --> 26:04.663
to put you away
for a long time.

26:04.729 --> 26:05.897
Prison here?

26:05.964 --> 26:07.933
Like a vacation.

26:07.999 --> 26:10.835
DEACON:
Well, that depends
on the facility.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.004
I mean, a guy like you,
wherever you get assigned,

26:13.071 --> 26:14.739
that makes all the difference,

26:14.806 --> 26:17.909
for better
or for worse.

26:17.976 --> 26:20.879
Tell us where your buddies
are keeping Jenni Moreno.

26:22.814 --> 26:25.183
(smacks lips) Well,
this is usually the part

26:25.250 --> 26:27.953
where we offer you
some form of immunity.

26:28.019 --> 26:29.321
Usually.

26:29.387 --> 26:30.956
In your case,

26:31.022 --> 26:32.691
no doubt
you're going to prison.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.759
But if you cooperate
and tell us where Jenni is,

26:34.826 --> 26:37.996
we'll make sure you land in one
that's more to your liking.

26:38.063 --> 26:39.364
Sorry.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.866
Got nothing for you.

26:46.671 --> 26:48.239
Detective Rios called.

26:48.306 --> 26:49.975
According to his CI,
word on the street:

26:50.041 --> 26:52.911
RCs arranged a meeting
for later today, right here

26:52.978 --> 26:54.045
in L.A.

26:52.978 --> 26:54.045
With who?

26:54.112 --> 26:55.647
Marcos Guzman.

26:56.514 --> 26:58.783
How's Marcos tied up
in all of this?
Not sure,

26:58.850 --> 27:00.819
but I didn't like it the moment
he stepped foot in here.

27:00.885 --> 27:02.821
I already sent Luca and Tan out
looking for him.

27:02.887 --> 27:05.757
Let's hope we get to him
before he gets to that meeting.

27:06.825 --> 27:08.827
(sighs)

27:17.335 --> 27:19.137
(tires squeal)

27:19.204 --> 27:20.839
(siren chirps)

27:23.074 --> 27:24.809
Where you headed, Marcos?

27:24.876 --> 27:25.710
Out.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.746
What's in the duffel
and the backpack?

27:27.812 --> 27:29.748
You don't got a warrant.
I don't got time for playing.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.216
So get out of my face
and move the damn cruiser.

27:31.282 --> 27:32.684
TAN:
Got a gun in plain view, Luca.

27:32.751 --> 27:34.919
Sounds like probable cause
to me.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.788
Plus, a credible source says
you're meeting

27:36.855 --> 27:37.722
with Ignacio's crew.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.290
So who's playing now?

27:37.789 --> 27:39.290
Hey, you don't know

27:39.357 --> 27:40.191
what the hell
you're talking about.

27:40.258 --> 27:42.761
Hey, Luca. Drugs.

27:42.827 --> 27:45.163
You know what? I thought
you were smarter than this.

27:45.230 --> 27:46.297
Turn around.

27:46.364 --> 27:47.399
You're under arrest.

27:46.364 --> 27:47.399
You dumbasses

27:47.465 --> 27:48.800
are gonna get that girl killed.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.668
I said turn around!
Give me your hands.

27:56.374 --> 28:00.345
(clock ticking)

28:00.412 --> 28:01.746
Are you ready to tell us
when and where

28:01.813 --> 28:03.748
your meeting with the RCs
is happening?

28:03.815 --> 28:05.750
Sit your ass down, man.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.819
Sit down!

28:08.787 --> 28:11.022
Look, this was never about
saving that girl, was it?

28:11.089 --> 28:13.258
It was about getting
your hands on her drugs.

28:13.324 --> 28:14.893
Don't matter
what I say.

28:14.959 --> 28:16.227
You ain't gonna believe me
anyway.

28:16.294 --> 28:18.696
Optics, right?

28:16.294 --> 28:18.696
Look, we're trying

28:18.763 --> 28:19.898
to get Jenni back
to Mama Pina safely.

28:19.964 --> 28:21.232
We thought you
wanted that, too.

28:21.299 --> 28:23.168
What the hell
do you think I was doing?

28:23.234 --> 28:25.036
The meeting
was never about business.

28:25.103 --> 28:26.404
Exactly what was it about, then?

28:26.471 --> 28:28.306
When things were popping off
at Mama Pina's,

28:28.373 --> 28:30.141
I saw Vera take off
with the backpack.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.844
I knew something was up,
so I found her and took it.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.846
Okay, and you didn't

28:32.911 --> 28:34.846
think to call us?

28:32.911 --> 28:34.846
I did.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.281
But I knew
you'd play it straight.

28:36.347 --> 28:39.317
So I set up the meet
with Rebeldes Centrales.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.919
Clean swap.

28:40.985 --> 28:42.821
The coke for Jenni.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.123
It was always
about getting her back safe.

28:45.190 --> 28:47.392
Not that this matters
to either one of you,

28:47.459 --> 28:50.495
but Ignacio is somebody
I would never do business with.

28:50.562 --> 28:54.866
What he does to women,
to girls...

28:54.933 --> 28:56.201
He deserves a hole
in the desert.

28:56.267 --> 28:57.869
LUCA: Okay, let's
say I believe you.

28:57.936 --> 28:59.471
It still wasn't
your call to make.

28:59.537 --> 29:00.972
Well, there's still time.

29:01.039 --> 29:02.273
But you got to let me
get out of here.

29:02.340 --> 29:03.842
You know that's
not happening, man.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.110
So I'm gonna
ask you again.

29:05.176 --> 29:07.212
When and where is

29:05.176 --> 29:07.212
it going down?

29:05.176 --> 29:07.212
Look,

29:07.278 --> 29:10.215
I made a promise to Mama Pina,
to bring Jenni back home to her.

29:10.281 --> 29:12.217
If I break that promise...

29:12.283 --> 29:13.985
(sighs)

29:14.052 --> 29:16.087
Look...

29:17.255 --> 29:18.957
...there was a time
in my mom's life

29:19.023 --> 29:20.992
where she hit rock bottom.

29:21.059 --> 29:23.261
I mean, we were
damn near living in our car.

29:23.328 --> 29:26.798
Mama Pina took us in,
no questions asked.

29:26.865 --> 29:29.167
She sees the good in people.

29:29.234 --> 29:32.504
And after all these years,
after everything I've done...

29:32.570 --> 29:35.039
she still sees that in me.

29:35.106 --> 29:37.909
I can't break
my promise to her.

29:39.577 --> 29:41.279
HICKS:
No.

29:41.346 --> 29:42.514
No way in hell.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.349
Commander, this is
our best option right now.

29:44.415 --> 29:45.917
You're asking me

29:45.984 --> 29:47.485
to let you piggyback on Marcos
for the trade--

29:47.552 --> 29:50.121
the same guy who just pulled
the wool over our eyes.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.789
Do I really have to break
it down for you two?

29:51.856 --> 29:54.259
Sir, with Marcos going in,
there's no way Ignacio's men

29:54.325 --> 29:55.426
will ever see us coming.

29:55.493 --> 29:58.129
We get Jenni Moreno back,
and then we take them down.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.899
Marcos'll be under our thumb
the entire time.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.133
He's a wild card.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.201
There's
too many unknown variables.

30:03.268 --> 30:04.269
I'll be with him.

30:04.335 --> 30:05.303
Undercover?

30:05.370 --> 30:06.404
Wouldn't be my first time.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.072
Except in those
situations

30:08.139 --> 30:10.942
we knew exactly who our allies
and our enemies were.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.544
Commander, I get
your concerns. I do.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.345
I just can't see
this going down

30:14.412 --> 30:17.115
any other way that doesn't tip
off the Rebeldes Centrales.

30:17.182 --> 30:18.850
We've taken them down
twice now.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.418
Their defenses
are way up.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.253
Marcos is
our only way in,

30:22.320 --> 30:24.322
and that girl's only chance
at survival.
And I'm sure

30:24.389 --> 30:26.191
his cooperation comes
with a cost.

30:26.257 --> 30:27.192
Uh, let me guess.

30:27.258 --> 30:29.160
We drop the charges
against him?

30:29.227 --> 30:31.095
Please.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.231
(sighs)

30:35.066 --> 30:38.369
I'll alert agencies
to stay clear of the sting.

30:38.436 --> 30:40.605
Thank you, Commander.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.608
If you screw this up...

30:45.109 --> 30:47.111
I...

30:47.178 --> 30:50.315
So don't screw it up.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.986
Units are on standby within
a mile radius of the marina.

30:55.053 --> 30:57.388
Now, the place is gonna be
crawling with Saturday shoppers,

30:57.455 --> 30:59.224
so let's get in and out

30:59.290 --> 31:01.426
without any civilian
getting hurt.
LUCA:
Ignacio's dudes

31:01.492 --> 31:03.394
wanted to do
the exchange in public.

31:03.461 --> 31:05.997
My guess-- they don't want
this going sideways.

31:06.064 --> 31:08.233
But still, the area surrounding
the marina is tight and dense.

31:08.299 --> 31:10.068
Too many exits.
Too many hiding spots.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.370
Our eyes and ears won't leave
those grounds once.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.370
Or Alonso.

31:12.437 --> 31:15.073
Each and every one of you better
have her six at all times.

31:15.139 --> 31:16.074
Hundred percent, sir.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.175
And is she ready

31:17.242 --> 31:20.245
to sell it
as Guzman's girlfriend?

31:21.679 --> 31:23.514
Ask her yourself.

31:23.581 --> 31:26.017
I'm gonna go with she's ready.

31:30.588 --> 31:32.123
Where's your service
weapon, Alonso?

31:32.190 --> 31:33.324
In my Louis.

31:33.391 --> 31:35.193
That looks like a Gucci to me.

31:35.260 --> 31:36.394
Bonnie's got one
just like it.

31:36.461 --> 31:38.663
Whatever.
As long as my gun fits.

31:39.998 --> 31:41.332
Did you search Marcos?

31:41.399 --> 31:43.268
I did a sweep of his car

31:43.334 --> 31:45.136
and patted him down twice.

31:45.203 --> 31:46.537
He's clean.

31:46.604 --> 31:49.307
All right, then.
Everyone go in stealth.

31:49.374 --> 31:50.575
I'll do that, sir.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.944
All right, Chris and
Marcos ride together.

31:53.011 --> 31:54.679
Tan and Street,
you're with Luca.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.080
Deacon, you're with me.

31:56.147 --> 31:57.615
Let's get
Jenni home safe.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.986
(sizzling)

32:02.720 --> 32:04.289
Thanks, man.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.289
You're welcome.

32:04.355 --> 32:06.491
(indistinct chatter)

32:08.559 --> 32:10.094
20-David.

32:10.161 --> 32:11.296
Everyone in position?

32:11.362 --> 32:13.298
22-David ready to rock and roll.

32:13.364 --> 32:14.699
TAN:
25-David ready.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.100
26-David in position.

32:16.167 --> 32:17.435
HONDO:
Roger that.

32:17.502 --> 32:19.971
Everyone stay loose.
Should be any minute now.

32:28.313 --> 32:30.281
They should be here by now.

32:30.348 --> 32:31.716
They'll be here.

32:46.664 --> 32:49.634
25-David. I got eyes on Jenni.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.638
(over radio):
Hondo, you seeing this?

32:53.705 --> 32:55.173
Guess he wasn't
out of the country.

32:55.239 --> 32:56.407
20-David to Command.
We have eyes

32:56.474 --> 32:57.575
on Ignacio Cuevas.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.378
All right.
All right, this is Command.

33:00.445 --> 33:03.181
Nothing changes.
Stick to the script.

33:03.247 --> 33:04.449
HONDO:
Roger that, Commander.

33:04.515 --> 33:06.284
Wasn't expecting the top dog.

33:06.351 --> 33:08.753
I knew you would know who I am.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.355
This is your extra muscle?

33:10.421 --> 33:12.623
Yeah, this is my girl.

33:12.690 --> 33:15.393
She's here helping us all
look chill as a cucumber.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.428
Guess she must have
a strong grip where it counts.

33:17.495 --> 33:18.730
Hey, watch your mouth.

33:18.796 --> 33:20.698
My mistake.

33:21.699 --> 33:23.301
That belong to me?

33:29.640 --> 33:31.642
Jenni takes a seat
next to my girl,

33:31.709 --> 33:33.478
then you get your bag.

33:37.548 --> 33:39.117
Okay.

33:39.183 --> 33:40.385
But first,
there's some business

33:40.451 --> 33:42.553
I've come a long way
to discuss with you.

33:42.620 --> 33:43.488
Hmm.

33:43.554 --> 33:45.390
20-David.
We're still not in the clear.

33:45.456 --> 33:47.158
Hold your positions.

33:47.225 --> 33:48.393
What the...

33:48.459 --> 33:50.395
What the hell is this?

33:50.461 --> 33:52.663
20-David to Command.
ICE is here.

33:52.730 --> 33:55.366
OFFICER:
Federal officers!
Hands in the air!

33:55.433 --> 33:57.201
(helicopter blades whirring)

33:57.268 --> 33:58.636
OFFICER:
Move in! Move in!

34:03.207 --> 34:05.376
LAPD SWAT! Put your gun down!

34:05.443 --> 34:07.145
¡Vamos! ¡Vamos! ¡Vamos!

34:07.211 --> 34:09.213
(gunshots, people screaming)

34:13.885 --> 34:16.120
Move in, move in. Stay low.
20-David to Command.

34:16.187 --> 34:17.155
Shots fired. Shots fired.

34:16.187 --> 34:17.155
Get down, get down.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.289
Tan, circle north.

34:18.356 --> 34:19.791
TAN: I'll go around.

34:18.356 --> 34:19.791
Code 8.

34:19.857 --> 34:22.360
Command to 20-David.
Sending backup.

34:22.427 --> 34:24.128
RIOS:
I checked
the narcotics database.

34:24.195 --> 34:25.830
No indication ICE was
actively investigating Cuevas.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.299
Typical three-letter agency,
leaving the rest of us

34:28.366 --> 34:30.301
in the dark.

34:28.366 --> 34:30.301
Yeah.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.702
Damn it!

34:31.769 --> 34:33.538
(people screaming)

34:33.604 --> 34:36.574
(gunshots)

34:41.312 --> 34:42.580
Hands behind your back!

34:43.514 --> 34:45.316
Hands behind
your back!

34:43.514 --> 34:45.316
Behind your back, now!

34:45.383 --> 34:47.318
22-David.
One suspect in custody.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.188
Which way did Chris go?

34:47.385 --> 34:50.188
That way.

34:56.794 --> 34:58.429
Drop your weapon!

35:01.732 --> 35:04.735
Gun on the ground, or she gets
a bullet between the brows.

35:04.802 --> 35:06.103
Okay. Okay.

35:09.507 --> 35:12.543
(grunting)

35:12.977 --> 35:14.779
(gunshots)

35:12.977 --> 35:14.779
(screams)

35:43.674 --> 35:45.343
MAN:
Don't move!

35:48.746 --> 35:50.181
Hands up
where I can see 'em!

35:50.248 --> 35:51.249
Now!

35:51.315 --> 35:52.517
HONDO:
She's LAPD!

35:52.583 --> 35:53.751
Stand down.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.353
Stand down.

36:01.292 --> 36:02.426
20-David.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.362
Suspect in custody. Code 4.

36:04.428 --> 36:06.597
Hey, you all right?

36:08.699 --> 36:10.468
Where is she? Where's Jenni?

36:12.503 --> 36:14.572
At about 1300 hours,
Cuevas entered the States

36:14.639 --> 36:16.307
using a false name.

36:16.374 --> 36:19.710
Now, ICE located him, but
they didn't alert anyone.

36:19.777 --> 36:21.612
So this is their screwup,
not ours.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.248
Now, typically,
I wouldn't condone it,

36:24.315 --> 36:26.684
but that was good thinking,
letting Jenni run.

36:26.751 --> 36:28.319
It would have been
even a bigger mess

36:28.386 --> 36:29.654
to sort out with DHS.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.322
How's she doing?

36:31.389 --> 36:32.723
HONDO:
With the exception

36:32.790 --> 36:34.725
of a hand laceration,
she's okay.
Good.

36:34.792 --> 36:36.460
Now, Cuevas and his men

36:36.527 --> 36:38.796
are looking at nice, long prison
stints, thanks to all of you.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.197
Really good work.

36:40.264 --> 36:42.233
Now, get out of my office
and go home.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.734
Thank you.

36:45.469 --> 36:46.537
Luca.

36:46.604 --> 36:47.772
Yes, sir.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.840
How's Mr. Guzman?

36:49.907 --> 36:52.443
(chuckles)
Couple stitches,
but he'll be all right.

36:52.510 --> 36:55.212
Well, tell him SWAT
appreciates his cooperation,

36:55.279 --> 36:57.915
even though it came
after obstructing justice.

36:57.982 --> 37:01.385
All right, you got it, boss.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.888
(chuckles quietly)

37:06.691 --> 37:08.893
(speaking Spanish)

37:14.632 --> 37:16.634
(sighs)

37:18.903 --> 37:21.939
(quietly speaking Spanish)

37:29.380 --> 37:31.382
(sets emergency brake)

37:33.651 --> 37:35.753
MAMA PINA:
My Jenni.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.357
(speaking Spanish)

37:39.423 --> 37:40.858
¿Sí?

37:40.925 --> 37:41.993
Jenni.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.830
Thanks for, uh...
thanks for driving

37:45.896 --> 37:49.333
and for being so patient
with me earlier.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.035
Always there for you.

37:59.043 --> 38:01.879
My, uh, cell phone
number's on the back.

38:01.946 --> 38:05.916
If you need any help in
the future, I'm your first call.

38:05.983 --> 38:08.653
Okay. Thank you.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.758
LUCA:
Pizza and wings on me tonight

38:13.824 --> 38:15.760
if you want to come by.

38:13.824 --> 38:15.760
I got to pass.

38:15.826 --> 38:17.595
I promised Bonnie we'd hit up
our favorite taco truck

38:17.662 --> 38:20.498
and just grub
in front of the TV.

38:17.662 --> 38:20.498
Ah, sounds like a solid plan.

38:20.564 --> 38:22.900
All right, you two

38:20.564 --> 38:22.900
lovebirds have fun.

38:20.564 --> 38:22.900
All right.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.435
Hey.

38:25.436 --> 38:26.871
What else you fools need?

38:26.937 --> 38:28.806
I already gave my statement.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.775
Nothing. We're good.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.777
Then I can go.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.512
Yeah, hold up, hold up.

38:34.578 --> 38:36.747
Look, despite everything...

38:36.814 --> 38:38.749
you came through for that girl.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.484
Mama Pina knows that.

38:40.551 --> 38:41.786
She's a good lady.

38:41.852 --> 38:44.822
Thanks for your help today, man.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.859
(car door closes)

38:49.860 --> 38:51.395
Hey.

38:51.462 --> 38:52.997
Don't think I'm gonna
bail your ass out

38:53.064 --> 38:54.765
every time
you can't solve a case.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.734
Don't think
I won't pull you over

38:56.801 --> 38:58.636
if I see your taillight out.

39:01.739 --> 39:03.808
(engine starts)

39:11.649 --> 39:13.684
Adoption?

39:13.751 --> 39:16.654
Is Nichelle going to do it?

39:17.755 --> 39:20.091
I know she really wants to.

39:20.157 --> 39:22.827
And you, baby,
what do you want her to do?

39:22.893 --> 39:24.829
It's up to her.

39:24.895 --> 39:27.565
Nichelle doesn't need you
or any man to raise a child

39:27.631 --> 39:28.933
and raise it well.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.868
I know--
I've done it myself.

39:30.935 --> 39:33.003
Doesn't mean I liked
doing it alone.

39:33.070 --> 39:35.940
It may not be a popular thing
by today's standards to say,

39:36.006 --> 39:39.677
but there's a comfort
in raising a child

39:39.744 --> 39:41.812
with the man that you love.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.548
Nichelle loves you, Daniel.

39:44.615 --> 39:46.584
And I love her. Very much.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.952
I know you do.

39:48.018 --> 39:50.421
And I also know--
now, forgive me for saying it--

39:50.488 --> 39:52.890
you look great, but you're
not getting any younger.

39:52.957 --> 39:55.760
Thanks for
reminding me, Ma.

39:52.957 --> 39:55.760
No, what I mean is,

39:55.826 --> 39:58.629
I just don't want you
to miss out on being a parent,

39:58.696 --> 40:00.865
if that's something
you really want.

40:00.931 --> 40:04.702
I know I'm pushy, and it's not
just because I want grandbabies.

40:04.769 --> 40:06.036
Oh, you don't.

40:06.103 --> 40:09.907
I do, yes, I do.
(laughing)

40:09.974 --> 40:11.909
But that's not why I bug you.

40:11.976 --> 40:14.011
It's because raising you
and your sister

40:14.078 --> 40:17.081
has been the most precious
part of my life.

40:17.148 --> 40:20.017
And I'd be lying if I said
I didn't want that for you.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.685
I know you do.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.687
Daniel...

40:25.489 --> 40:28.125
Daniel, look at me.

40:28.192 --> 40:29.894
You...

40:29.960 --> 40:32.496
will be a great father.

40:32.563 --> 40:35.733
You won't make the same mistakes
your daddy made.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.503
You've long ago proved
that you're your own man.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.839
A loving man.

40:41.906 --> 40:43.541
I don't know, sometimes...

40:43.607 --> 40:45.042
I've always known.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.811
Three-year-old Hondo
in the hospital

40:46.877 --> 40:48.813
looking out
for your big sister.

40:48.879 --> 40:51.682
(chuckles)
That night,
I said to myself,

40:51.749 --> 40:54.451
"My son is a protector.

40:54.518 --> 40:56.720
My son is good."

40:57.688 --> 41:00.891
Now, come on, take this old lady
to a proper dinner.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.527
Never old. Always beautiful.

41:03.594 --> 41:05.563
(door opens)

41:03.594 --> 41:05.563
(laughs)

41:05.629 --> 41:06.997
(door closes)

41:07.998 --> 41:09.767
Hey.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.502
Hey.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.502
Hi, Charice.

41:11.569 --> 41:13.671
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

41:13.737 --> 41:15.039
Uh...
(chuckles)

41:15.105 --> 41:16.774
...well, you know,
I'm just gonna go,

41:16.841 --> 41:18.676
um, get a little makeup.

41:18.742 --> 41:19.944
Mm.

41:22.713 --> 41:24.615
Hondo...

41:22.713 --> 41:24.615
Nichelle.

41:24.682 --> 41:26.884
Let me just say this first.

41:26.951 --> 41:30.521
I'm sorry for not supporting you
at first today.

41:30.588 --> 41:33.557
I made it about me,
and that was selfish.

41:33.624 --> 41:35.893
This has always been your dream.

41:35.960 --> 41:39.730
And, baby, you deserve all
your dreams to come true.

41:39.797 --> 41:42.233
I told the agency yes.

41:45.836 --> 41:49.106
We'll figure it out together,
then.

41:56.947 --> 41:58.082
CHARICE:
Oh...

41:58.148 --> 41:59.917
(groans softly)

41:59.984 --> 42:02.786
What did I miss?

42:02.853 --> 42:03.854
(Charice chuckles softly)

42:19.670 --> 42:21.672
