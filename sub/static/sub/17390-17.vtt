WEBVTT

00:03.004 --> 00:04.403
Thanks for cooking, Ma.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.405
I haven't had a real
home-cooked meal in...

00:06.407 --> 00:08.674
one day.

00:13.681 --> 00:17.082
God, you're pretty.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.753
Oh, you're lucky
you're pretty, too.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.622
Oh, I've missed
nights like this.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.492
Everybody I love
under the same roof.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.694
Well, my wife couldn't make it,
so not everyone.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.529
I knew what I was saying.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.500
You guys got to come see
what the girls did to Grandpa.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.301
It's awesome.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.437
I bet it's not as awesome
as your mother's coffee.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.605
I made that.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.040
It's bitter. I don't...

00:50.317 --> 00:52.451
We turned him
into a princess.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.521
He's all over my
Instagram now.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.190
You're about
to break the Internet.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.825
Good. I hate the Internet.

01:01.629 --> 01:06.065
Princess Cranky, the grumpiest
princess in all the land.

01:07.835 --> 01:11.103
You're such a pushover when
it comes to these kids, Joe.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.073
Well, I can't say no
to these sweet faces.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.374
Ah, well,
when you live with them,

01:15.376 --> 01:16.575
that wears off pretty quick.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.644
Okay, guys,
up to bed.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.179
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, Grandpa.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.513
Good night.
Night. Night.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.148
Love you.
Night. Oh.

01:23.150 --> 01:27.219
Ooh, this damn shoulder's
barking at me again.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.821
You got a couple of pain pills?

01:28.823 --> 01:30.322
Did you check
your purse?

01:31.659 --> 01:35.194
Relax, Princess. I'll get
you some from the kitchen.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.797
I worry about your dad.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.433
He's been taking
way too many pills lately.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.702
Well, if they're mood enhancers,
they've met their match.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.372
What does his doctor
say about all this?

01:47.374 --> 01:49.641
Oh, he hasn't been
to the doctor since...

01:49.643 --> 01:52.711
Well, it was the morning
after Obama first won.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.281
His blood pressure
shot through the roof.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.318
Ma, that's almost
ten years ago.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.253
You got to get him to go.

02:01.255 --> 02:04.523
I've tried, but he is
so stuck in his ways.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.291
About everything.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.393
Bought him a cordless phone.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.761
He still stands
right next to the base.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.230
Makes me furious.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.233
Well, somebody
should talk to him.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.467
Any volunteers?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.839
Fine, I'll do it.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.608
Oh, thank you, honey.
Mm-hmm.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.677
No, no, no. No.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.679
Let's go upstairs and
pretend like we don't know

02:27.681 --> 02:29.815
what's happening.
Come on.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.251
I learn something new
from you every day.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.154
Dad, you got to
go to the doctor.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.655
If you don't
get a check-up,

02:36.657 --> 02:38.690
how will you know if
something's wrong with you?

02:38.692 --> 02:40.425
I'd rather not know.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.661
Smile, smile, smile, dead.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.464
That's how I want
to punch my ticket.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.702
Okay.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.571
Okay, when did you ever smile?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.306
(laughs)

02:54.308 --> 02:56.275
He smiles at me
all the time.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.577
Yeah, see? Why can't you be
more like your brother?

02:58.579 --> 03:00.412
He's always on my side,
right, Donny?

03:00.414 --> 03:03.315
Ah, you got it, Pops.

03:03.317 --> 03:06.618
He's not on your side,
he's just a big yes man.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.321
Everybody's a yes man
when you're always right.

03:09.323 --> 03:12.224
All right, all right,
so let me get this straight.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.826
You two jokers have decided
you don't need doctors.

03:14.828 --> 03:18.263
I got through the Vietnam War
on aspirin and Bengay.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.867
That's not true.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.202
You weren't there.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.406
You weren't there!

03:27.408 --> 03:29.741
Adam, let me talk to you
for a minute in the kitchen.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.510
Come on.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.225
What?

03:46.227 --> 03:48.360
I just brought you in here
so Dad could leave.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.661
What?

03:49.663 --> 03:51.063
Dad!

03:51.064 --> 03:52.464
Thanks for letting me
borrow your car.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.603
¶ ¶

04:05.546 --> 04:07.412
All right, Mom and Dad'll
be here any minute.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.448
Dad's been avoiding
me all week about

04:09.450 --> 04:11.350
going to the
doctor, but I know

04:11.352 --> 04:13.369
he can't resist brunch.

04:13.370 --> 04:15.387
That man would walk into a hail
of bullets for a plate of bacon.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.522
Yeah. I turned
the exhaust fan on high

04:17.524 --> 04:18.991
so the smell wafts outside.

04:18.993 --> 04:21.760
He's gonna float in here
like a cartoon bear.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.530
You guys might get along better
if you stop nagging the old man.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.666
Hey, I'd much rather
be the fun son, like you,

04:27.668 --> 04:30.369
but someone has to step up
and deal with things.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.271
And that kind of attitude is why
he doesn't invite you

04:32.273 --> 04:33.672
to go mall walking with us.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.742
You guys go mall walking
together?

04:36.744 --> 04:40.045
Yeah. We got matching
sweat suits. It's adorable.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.648
I'd mall walk
if someone asked me.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.416
Three guys
in matching sweat suits?

04:44.418 --> 04:45.984
That's a boy band, Adam.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.423
Honey, I'll go mall
walking with you.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.926
Not you.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.395
Hey.
Morning.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.663
ADAM:
Hey, Ma.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.830
Where's Dad?

04:58.832 --> 04:59.898
He won't come. He doesn't want

04:59.900 --> 05:00.966
to hear it about the doctor.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.834
But Lowell was nice enough

05:02.836 --> 05:04.303
to give me a ride.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.038
He told me
if I ever needed anything,

05:06.040 --> 05:07.606
I should call him.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.775
I didn't think
she'd really call.

05:09.777 --> 05:10.776
Oh, she calls.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.378
ADAM: Oh.
I love him.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.380
It's like having a house boy.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.787
Lowell, you do not want
to start driving her around.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.322
All right? She's got
a million places to go,

05:23.324 --> 05:24.656
and they all suck.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.793
I can't tell her no;
she's too nice.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.328
Listen, when I first
married Adam,

05:29.330 --> 05:30.862
I got roped into
driving her everywhere.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.864
And the only way I got out of it

05:32.866 --> 05:34.466
was by going into labor
with Kate

05:34.468 --> 05:35.934
in the middle of a yarn shop.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.603
And before Andi,
I used to drive her.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.372
That's when I learned
a little trick called

05:40.374 --> 05:41.940
"pretending to fall asleep."

05:42.776 --> 05:43.809
I got it from
watching the possums

05:43.811 --> 05:44.876
on The Animal Channel.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.412
Who wouldn't
mind driving me

05:47.414 --> 05:48.947
to the outlets
on Saturday?

05:54.521 --> 05:55.687
I can't believe
Dad wouldn't come.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.755
He is so stubborn.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.090
Oh, the both of you
are stubborn.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.624
Hey, don't say I'm like Dad.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.759
You know I hate that.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.127
I wasn't going to.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.663
I was just going to look
at Andi knowingly.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.765
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.434
Okay, so nobody's
gonna do anything?

06:09.436 --> 06:11.036
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.138
Fine.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.906
I'll go over there
and talk to Dad--

06:14.908 --> 06:16.408
who I'm nothing like...

06:17.378 --> 06:18.910
...and be the bad guy
like I always am.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.412
Bacon's not my only weapon.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.414
I got one more way
to turn up the heat.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.850
Good luck. He already
keeps the heat on 82.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.486
You should see how I sweat
through my nightgown.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.788
Ma, no.

06:34.995 --> 06:38.497
Dad, I know you're home.
I heard you yelling at the news.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.402
Hey. Would you stop
banging on my house?

06:43.404 --> 06:45.470
I'm trying to get my dad
to come out here.

06:45.472 --> 06:48.440
Wait, you're the landlord.
Can you unlock his door for me?

06:48.442 --> 06:50.409
Nah, I like him more than you.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.643
You like him?

06:51.645 --> 06:53.945
He calls you
Mrs. Chiquita Banana.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.647
Yeah, and I call him
Colonel Sanders.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.948
We have a thing, we're fun.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.266
(groans)

06:58.267 --> 06:59.583
What's with all
the yapping, Charo?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.686
Dad, just get
in the car.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.455
I don't have to do what you say.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.091
Fine, I can stand
out here all day.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.427
Eh, not on my front
porch, you can't.

07:08.429 --> 07:09.928
All right, you old drumstick,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.930
get your Kentucky Fried butt
in the car.
Okay.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.900
Okay, settle down. I'm going.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.936
You want to learn
how to be a man?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.004
Watch her.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.207
Wow.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.875
He got us both in one shot.
He's good.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.043
Mm.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.115
Grandpa,
please go to the doctor.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.716
TEDDY:
Yeah, Grandpa.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.985
If you're gone,
who's gonna ask me

07:33.987 --> 07:36.021
to pull their finger
every morning?

07:39.126 --> 07:40.792
Grandma?

07:42.162 --> 07:44.963
No, that's a grandpa's job.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.598
He's teetering.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.234
Yep. And now the little one
for the win.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.142
Please go to the
doctor, Grandpa.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.478
I love you so much.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.715
Oh, kids,
I can't say no to you.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.151
So why don't you leave the room
so I can say no to your dad.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.155
Come on!

08:10.157 --> 08:12.624
(scoffs) Everybody
in this room

08:12.626 --> 08:14.226
goes to the doctor once a year.

08:14.228 --> 08:16.194
Okay, it's what
normal humans do.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.829
What is your problem?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.832
Look, I had this friend, Barney,
from the VFW.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.001
His wife was named Libby.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.237
I always found that strange.

08:25.239 --> 08:28.707
Libby. What's that short for?

08:30.644 --> 08:32.611
Elibabeth?

08:33.847 --> 08:34.846
Can I talk here?

08:35.916 --> 08:37.883
Anyway, it had been a while,

08:37.885 --> 08:39.918
and Barney went in
'cause he had a cough.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.686
When he came out
of that doctor's office,

08:41.688 --> 08:43.054
his cough was gone.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.589
Because he was dead.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.593
Poor Elibabeth.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.597
Now she's a wibow.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.168
Don't do what he does.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.188
Let's go, Donny.

09:00.189 --> 09:02.206
I'm with you, Dad,
just like on our mall walks

09:02.209 --> 09:04.242
that Adam is not invited to.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.813
Yeah, did you know
they go mall walking together?

09:11.084 --> 09:13.084
I never should have said
anything to Adam.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.786
Now they're just in a big fight.

09:14.788 --> 09:15.921
(Andi groans)

09:15.923 --> 09:17.689
Bev, this is
going nowhere.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.891
Oh, they're throwing handfuls
of snow at each other.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.961
Oh, well, that's nice.
I like to see my boys playing.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.098
Here's what we'll do:
I will call Adam's doctor

09:27.100 --> 09:28.667
and make Joe an appointment,

09:28.669 --> 09:30.235
and then you will annoy him
until he goes.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.770
I can do annoying.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.204
Hi, um, I'd like
to make an appointment

09:33.206 --> 09:34.706
with Dr. Phillips, please.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.841
What?

09:36.843 --> 09:38.843
Oh. Uh...

09:38.845 --> 09:40.712
No, that's okay.
I'll call back.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.647
Okay, bye-bye.
What happened?

09:42.649 --> 09:45.917
Dr. Phillips retired
five years ago.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.253
But Adam said
he sees him every year,

09:48.255 --> 09:50.855
which means someone's a liar.

09:50.857 --> 09:54.926
Why would Dr. Phillips lie
about his retirement?

09:57.731 --> 10:00.799
Oh, that's right,
you're Don's mom, too.

10:04.004 --> 10:07.105
Listen, you can't make me do
what I don't want to do.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.007
So why don't you go
back in the kitchen

10:09.009 --> 10:10.742
with the rest
of the jibbedas.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.611
What's a jibbeda?

10:12.613 --> 10:14.679
You know,
jibbeda, jibbeda, jibbeda.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.281
Adam?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.083
Look, I was thinking,

10:18.085 --> 10:20.719
maybe your dad would feel better
if you told him

10:20.721 --> 10:22.721
how your last physical went.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.156
Huh? Wh-When was that again?

10:25.158 --> 10:26.625
Uh, I don't know,
I saw Dr. Phillips,

10:26.627 --> 10:27.626
like, six months ago.

10:27.628 --> 10:28.360
Checked my heart,

10:28.362 --> 10:29.761
my blood pressure,

10:29.763 --> 10:31.630
gave me the one-handed juggle.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.034
That's interesting because

10:36.036 --> 10:37.902
Dr. Phillips retired
five years ago.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.437
Yeah.

10:39.438 --> 10:40.971
I just called his office.
Busted.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.908
No, no, not busted.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.311
I still go to his office,
but I see a different doctor.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.413
Oh, really? What's his name?

10:48.415 --> 10:51.116
Dr. Pepper.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.119
Literally any other name
would've worked.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.363
Adam, why haven't you been
going to the doctor?

11:05.365 --> 11:08.700
Get him, Bev.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.301
How can you say that to me
and not Dad?

11:10.303 --> 11:12.837
Because I live with him and
he controls the thermostat.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.105
God.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.975
A person can only buy
so many nightgowns.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.711
Okay, look, last time I went,

11:19.713 --> 11:21.112
they wanted to run
all these extra tests,

11:21.114 --> 11:23.348
and I had to sweat
the results out for a week

11:23.350 --> 11:24.916
before they came back normal.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.352
It scared the crap out of me.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.953
So you lied
and stopped going?

11:28.955 --> 11:31.089
Hey, you have secrets, too,
upstairs candy drawer.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.857
(gasps)

11:34.928 --> 11:38.329
That is not mine, that
was here when we moved in.

11:38.331 --> 11:41.466
Dad, you're a doctor-hater,
back me up on this.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.202
Adam, you are being a moron
for ignoring your health.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.071
What?!

11:46.073 --> 11:47.939
From you? Seriously?

11:47.941 --> 11:50.742
Well, this is different.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.344
You have young kids,
a beautiful wife.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.180
You have a reason to live.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.816
I heard that one, Joe.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.752
God, you're pretty.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.455
Very funny.

12:03.457 --> 12:06.191
The point is,
we all want you to go.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.729
Okay, okay, I'll go.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.197
But on one condition:

12:12.199 --> 12:13.331
You're going, too.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.500
So you won't go unless I go?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.185
That's right.

12:17.186 --> 12:18.869
Just like when
you potty-trained him.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.840
Fine.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.241
Ha-ha!

12:23.243 --> 12:24.909
You're going, too, Don.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.250
These gowns are ridiculous.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.818
Well, at least
your gown fits.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.920
I'm flapping in the
breeze down here.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.423
That's because they don't have
the Jolly Green Giant size.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.158
Speaking of that...
¶ Ho, ho, ho ¶

12:40.160 --> 12:41.426
Legs together.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.896
You know, we could be home
watching the game right now,

12:44.898 --> 12:47.999
but, no, you had to go and
make a big stink about this.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.901
Hey, I'm just trying
to be a good son.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.035
I mean,
look at this one.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.203
He keeps licking
tongue depressors

12:52.205 --> 12:53.338
and putting them back.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.074
I got to be better than him.

12:57.511 --> 12:59.310
Well, all I know is
I've had enough already.

12:59.312 --> 13:03.181
And no way in hell you're
getting me through that door.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.917
Good morning, gentlemen.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.051
I'm Dr. Knox.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.553
I'll be doing your
check-ups today.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.555
So, who's up first?

13:10.557 --> 13:12.557
That'd me be.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.325
Let's get this party started.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.198
Here we go.
Thank you.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.567
Well, it's a good thing
I threw on some pants,

13:22.569 --> 13:24.169
'cause I really thought
this house was empty.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.437
Oh. Hi, honey.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.472
I just wanted to be
here when the boys

13:27.474 --> 13:29.407
came home from
the doctor.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.341
And Lowell was nice enough
to give me another ride.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.911
We got up so early,
we already stopped

13:32.913 --> 13:34.212
at the farmer's market.

13:35.282 --> 13:38.082
We helped
the farmers set up.

13:39.286 --> 13:42.587
I found a potato
that looks like Elvis.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.390
Oh.
Lowell said he'd glue
some sideburns on.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.226
I did.
I did say that.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.929
I don't know why.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.463
You know, Bev,

13:52.465 --> 13:55.033
Lowell has a family
and-and responsibilities.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.302
He-he can't keep
giving you rides everywhere.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.369
Oh.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.604
I'm so sorry, dear.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.206
I just wasn't thinking.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.142
You don't have to
take me to the outlets.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.844
Oh, Andi, you can take me.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.879
No. No. What...

14:07.881 --> 14:09.080
What just happened?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.216
I'm free.
Lowell?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.318
Get back here!
No, you got to help me.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.520
No chance, sister. One of us
has to live to tell this story.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.088
You...
Hey, Lowell.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.923
Out of my way!
Whoa.

14:18.925 --> 14:20.225
BEV:
Hey, boys,

14:20.227 --> 14:21.559
did you get a clean bill
of health?

14:21.561 --> 14:23.494
Yeah, yeah, we're all good.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.063
But this lucky guy

14:25.065 --> 14:29.067
won himself a date
with a colonoscopy.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.369
These prep instructions
read like a war movie,

14:31.371 --> 14:33.471
and my rear end's
Omaha Beach.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.341
This is all your fault.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.076
Hey, I was just
looking out for you.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.511
Well, I don't need it. Why don't
you just mind your own business?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.213
Because you are
my business.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.616
You know, I took the day
off of work to make sure

14:44.618 --> 14:46.451
you stay healthy
and live a long time.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.119
Jibbeda, jibbeda, jibbeda.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.990
And you wonder why I'd rather
hang out with your brother?

14:51.992 --> 14:53.524
Wow.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.927
You know, I haven't been
a dad as long as you,

14:55.929 --> 14:57.929
but I'm pretty sure you're
not supposed to say that.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.097
Oh.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.632
You and your new rules.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.533
In the old days, you could
hurt anybody's feelings.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.235
Okay, I can't even
talk to him anymore.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.404
Well, I can't talk
to you either!
Ah!

15:06.406 --> 15:08.273
Joe, I think
you're overreacting.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.276
Yeah, I mean, they do these
colonoscopy things all the time.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.544
You know, they scare you
with the thought of

15:13.546 --> 15:15.213
aliens probing your butt,

15:15.215 --> 15:17.482
but it's your own people
you have to worry about.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.421
Aw, Oreos and milk?

15:23.423 --> 15:25.290
That's your sad snack.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.292
I'm not even
pulling them apart

15:27.294 --> 15:29.093
and having fun with them.
Aw.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.362
You know,

15:31.364 --> 15:32.997
I'm just trying
to help my dad.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.233
Would it kill him
to say "thank you"?

15:35.235 --> 15:36.701
Oh, honey, I think it might.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.169
Yeah.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.440
I'm not asking for much,
just a little,

15:42.442 --> 15:44.375
"Adam, I see that
you look out for me

15:44.377 --> 15:46.311
"and I appreciate that,
because your older brother

15:46.313 --> 15:47.645
is a narcoleptic ape."

15:50.150 --> 15:52.183
Look, he appreciates you.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.252
He's just not the kind of guy
that lets it out,

15:54.254 --> 15:57.055
but it's in there,
deep, deep down in there.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.390
Maybe they'll find it
during the probe.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.396
Look, hon, it's always been
this way with you guys.

16:05.398 --> 16:06.965
He doesn't like
to talk about feelings,

16:06.967 --> 16:08.199
you don't like to
talk about feelings.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.534
You're both incredibly stubborn.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.669
(scoffs)
In fact, you could say

16:11.671 --> 16:13.671
that the both of you
are almost exact...

16:13.673 --> 16:15.340
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:15.342 --> 16:16.741
Don't say it.

16:16.743 --> 16:20.078
We agreed many years ago
you can't say that.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.147
I mean, what if I were to say
that you and your mother are...

16:23.149 --> 16:26.751
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:26.753 --> 16:30.521
Let's just put the pins
back in these grenades

16:30.523 --> 16:32.623
and walk away.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.510
So your dad's colonoscopy
went very well.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.112
Oh, good. Good news.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.114
I have seen that man eat
his whole life,

16:56.116 --> 16:58.016
and I just want to say
I'm very sorry

16:58.018 --> 17:00.051
for what you had
to go through today.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.021
Uh, just to warn you,

17:03.023 --> 17:05.123
he's probably going to be
a little loopy

17:05.125 --> 17:06.624
from the anesthesia.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.560
He might say some things
he wouldn't normally say.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.263
What, like what
he's really feeling?

17:12.265 --> 17:14.165
If he's feeling it,
you'll hear it.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.768
Sometimes it's beautiful.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.603
Most of the time, it's creepy.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.276
Hey, Dr. Foxy.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.780
Dad, it's Dr. Knox.

17:28.782 --> 17:31.282
That's what I said,
Dr. Knockers.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.420
So how you feeling?

17:35.422 --> 17:36.654
Jazzy, like a jazz man.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.056
(imitates jazz drumming)

17:38.058 --> 17:39.257
Okay.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.392
Okay. Yeah.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.827
You know, when they
were putting me under,

17:42.829 --> 17:44.462
I got worried
I'd never wake up.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.366
And then I'd never see
the people I love again.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.402
Your mother,
your brother, Andi...

17:52.405 --> 17:54.205
...those kids...

17:54.207 --> 17:56.307
Yeah, and?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.209
Tony.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.778
Tony?

18:00.780 --> 18:03.514
Yeah, Tony.
I met him on the way in.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.385
I love that guy.

18:12.859 --> 18:17.095
Ah, I just need a signature
on these release papers.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.330
Oh, he's just getting dressed;
he'll be out in a minute.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.599
Uh, actually, these are for you.
He put you down as his proxy.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.302
He did?
Before he went in,

18:24.304 --> 18:26.337
he kept saying, "Make sure
Adam takes care of everything.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.439
He's the only one I trust."

18:29.609 --> 18:31.642
He actually said that?

18:31.644 --> 18:33.144
B-Before the drugs?

18:35.315 --> 18:36.547
Yeah.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.350
Well...

18:39.352 --> 18:40.751
on to the next butt.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.253
Ah.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.898
Hey, Dad.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.666
What are you grinning at?

18:58.505 --> 19:00.238
Nothing.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.540
Come on, everyone's home,
waiting to see you.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.709
I just had a damn
movie camera up my ass.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.378
I'm moving
as fast as I can.

19:09.282 --> 19:12.583
Well, if we time it right,
we can finish our mall walk

19:12.585 --> 19:15.486
right when Cinnabon opens.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.854
Hey, guys.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.825
What are you
doing here?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.793
Just heading down
to the mall for a walk.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.529
Are you guys going
to the mall, too?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.197
That's lucky.
(chuckles)

19:26.199 --> 19:27.865
No, no, no, no, no,
this is our thing.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.535
Your thing is fighting,
our thing is friends.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.203
I'm going. Mom said I could.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.839
And you know what
I have in my pocket?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.574
Three gift cards for Cinnabon.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.809
All right, let him in.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.779
And you know what I have
in my other pocket?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.714
Another gift card for suck it.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.183
Hey, Dad, wait up!

19:50.290 --> 19:51.822
Yeah, Bev, we want you to
be able to get around

19:51.824 --> 19:53.791
without depending
on, well, me.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.860
Um, and we found
a solution.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.895
It's a driving
service called Uber.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.363
Uber?

19:59.365 --> 20:01.666
Sounds German.
I don't like it.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.903
No, it's an app
on your phone.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.374
