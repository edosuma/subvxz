(Galloping hoofbeats)

00:05.133 --> 00:06.767
KATRINA:
Ichabod!

00:07.201 --> 00:09.068
(Crane panting)

00:44.338 --> 00:46.372
(Coat tears)

00:55.649 --> 00:57.350
(Branches cracking, snapping)

01:18.471 --> 01:20.640
KATRINA:
We are safe here for now.

01:20.774 --> 01:21.941
Katrina.

01:21.976 --> 01:24.410
(Low rumbling)

01:24.445 --> 01:26.635
- What is this place?
- There isn't time to explain.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.751
You've been charged
to a larger purpose.

01:28.786 --> 01:30.550
Yes, I know.
To stop the Four Horsemen.

01:30.584 --> 01:33.199
Conquest, War, Famine and Death,
Ichabod.

01:33.212 --> 01:35.903
The very one whose head
you claimed on the battlefield.

01:39.059 --> 01:41.327
But now he's returned
to gather the others.

01:43.063 --> 01:45.898
Together they will unleash
the Apocalypse.

01:45.933 --> 01:47.400
Before the Four Horsemen
can ride,

01:47.434 --> 01:49.602
an army of evil will make way
for their arrival.

01:49.637 --> 01:51.270
(Low rumbling)

01:51.305 --> 01:54.073
The first dark spirit rises
with the blood moon.

01:54.108 --> 01:55.274
She's one of us.

01:55.309 --> 01:56.609
One of who?

01:56.644 --> 01:58.845
You must stop her
before she kills again.

01:58.879 --> 01:59.846
Katrina?!

02:00.881 --> 02:02.415
Katrina?!

02:04.652 --> 02:06.119
(Raspy hissing)

02:22.427 --> 02:23.430
Morning, sir.

02:23.505 --> 02:24.877
I must to speak with
Lieutenant Mills immediately.

02:24.954 --> 02:26.396
I can't let you leave the room.

02:26.481 --> 02:28.616
You're a material witness
in an ongoing investigation.

02:28.654 --> 02:29.991
Well, I'm afraid it cannot wait.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.850
Lieutenant Mills
will be here shortly, sir.

02:35.649 --> 02:36.883
IRVING:
We've been over this.

02:36.917 --> 02:38.051
The circumstances surrounding

02:38.085 --> 02:39.919
Sheriff Corbin's murder
are opaque at best.

02:39.953 --> 02:42.155
That's one way of putting it.

02:42.189 --> 02:45.658
Another way would be to say
that he was killed with an axe

02:45.693 --> 02:47.193
by a man with no head,

02:47.227 --> 02:48.661
but that'd make me sound crazy.

02:48.696 --> 02:49.896
You said it, not me.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.330
Not just my words, sir.

02:51.365 --> 02:52.765
Two other officers went on record.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.280
They recanted.

02:56.670 --> 02:58.171
What?

02:58.205 --> 03:00.239
What do you mean they recanted?

03:00.274 --> 03:02.709
Two men, in a firefight
with an unknown assailant

03:02.743 --> 03:05.201
while ducking behind
a police vehicle at dawn,

03:05.236 --> 03:06.831
when the light was low?

03:06.866 --> 03:08.624
They may not be
this precinct's finest,

03:08.659 --> 03:09.782
but even they're smart
enough to know how

03:09.817 --> 03:11.451
that will sound
to an investigating committee.

03:11.485 --> 03:13.252
They're scared.

03:13.287 --> 03:15.755
You're damn right they're scared,
the whole town's scared.

03:15.789 --> 03:17.686
- What about Brooks?
- What about him?

03:17.721 --> 03:19.692
He was locked in a cell
less than five minutes,

03:19.727 --> 03:22.628
yet somehow, someone,
something got in there

03:22.663 --> 03:25.287
and snapped his head backwards
like a PEZ dispenser.

03:25.322 --> 03:27.860
Come with me.

03:29.403 --> 03:32.171
This is two minutes after the
duty officer closes the door.

03:46.653 --> 03:47.620
(Shrieks)

03:47.654 --> 03:50.123
No.

03:50.157 --> 03:51.290
No?

03:51.325 --> 03:54.560
That is not what happened.

03:54.595 --> 03:56.395
Give us a minute, please.

04:00.934 --> 04:05.538
Sir, I'm telling you there was
something in that cell with him.

04:05.572 --> 04:07.039
Are we really having
this conversation?

04:07.074 --> 04:08.241
I am not the only one
that saw it.

04:08.275 --> 04:10.143
I assume you're referring
to Mr. Crane,

04:10.177 --> 04:11.744
our resident time traveler.

04:14.279 --> 04:15.982
ABBIE: Sir, you were in
the interrogation room.

04:16.016 --> 04:17.683
You saw what happened.

04:17.718 --> 04:19.652
He passed the polygraph
without a single spike.

04:19.685 --> 04:21.721
That is hardly without precedent.

04:21.755 --> 04:24.490
We sent his test in
for further psych evaluation.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.879
The doctors say our man
suffers from a disorder

04:26.950 --> 04:29.132
known as
"objective transference."

04:29.167 --> 04:31.831
(Gasps)

04:32.165 --> 04:35.067
He may really believe that
he decapitated a Hessian soldier

04:35.102 --> 04:36.302
during the Revolutionary War,

04:36.336 --> 04:38.237
that his wife is a witch

04:38.272 --> 04:40.706
who put a spell on him,
and now he woke up

04:40.741 --> 04:43.785
two centuries later
in Sleepy Hollow.

04:45.211 --> 04:49.081
The details, the personality,
they're all wildly specific

04:49.116 --> 04:52.685
and impossibly thorough.
Know why?

04:52.719 --> 04:56.722
Because the human brain is limitless
in its ability to trick itself.

04:56.757 --> 04:58.958
(Horse whinnies)

04:58.992 --> 05:01.227
(Galloping hoofbeats)

05:01.261 --> 05:03.196
(Roaring)

05:04.798 --> 05:07.166
So you think we're both crazy?

05:07.201 --> 05:08.768
Possibly.

05:08.802 --> 05:10.803
Look, I can't explain
what's going on here.

05:10.838 --> 05:12.638
Not yet.

05:12.673 --> 05:15.767
But in the absence of options,
you and this Crane

05:15.809 --> 05:18.096
may be my only choice.

05:21.682 --> 05:24.917
I won't be at the funeral.
I'm sorry.

05:24.952 --> 05:27.687
I'm going to Albany
to secure some resources.

05:27.721 --> 05:30.256
While I'm gone,
I'm giving you some latitude.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.491
But I am warning you,
Lieutenant.

05:32.526 --> 05:35.199
Do not embarrass me.

05:42.269 --> 05:43.636
(Knocking on door)

05:45.606 --> 05:47.106
This is unacceptable!

05:47.140 --> 05:49.475
I will not be held
prisoner here!

05:49.509 --> 05:50.977
And good morning to you, too.
Thanks, Mike.

05:51.011 --> 05:53.179
(Scoffs):
Mike.

05:53.213 --> 05:55.214
If I'm charged with no crime,
why am I under guard?

05:55.249 --> 05:58.150
Well, for one, it's the law.

05:58.185 --> 06:00.152
As a free man,
any law that takes away

06:00.187 --> 06:03.789
my God-given right serves
neither God nor its own design.

06:03.824 --> 06:05.558
Okay, it's a little early
in the morning

06:05.592 --> 06:07.360
for a Constitutional debate.
Have a donut hole.

06:07.394 --> 06:11.664
I don't want a donut hole.

06:11.698 --> 06:12.798
Take heed, Lieutenant.

06:12.833 --> 06:15.501
I received a warning
last night from Katrina.

06:15.535 --> 06:18.104
Katrina. Your wife was here?

06:18.138 --> 06:22.775
No. She appeared to me in a dream,
or more aptly, a vision.

06:22.809 --> 06:24.310
For the time being,

06:24.344 --> 06:25.845
the Headless Horseman seems
to have vanished.

06:25.879 --> 06:28.214
Which, in theory,
would provide relief.

06:28.248 --> 06:29.515
Except she said,

06:29.549 --> 06:34.119
"The first dark spirit awaits
entry into your world."

06:36.123 --> 06:38.057
(Mutters):
Mmm, these are good.

06:38.091 --> 06:40.459
That's your proof?
Your dead wife told you this

06:40.494 --> 06:42.094
in a dream?

06:42.129 --> 06:44.797
Someone's given you reason
to doubt my veracity.

06:44.831 --> 06:47.867
Oh, I didn't need a reason.
I've been doubting you since we met.

06:47.901 --> 06:49.135
And myself.

06:49.169 --> 06:51.971
And now you're telling me that
something new is coming,

06:52.005 --> 06:55.041
but you don't know what,
or who, or why.

06:55.075 --> 06:58.144
After all we've seen,
you're still holding onto uncertainty.

06:58.178 --> 07:02.315
I'm trying to hold onto my sanity,
not to mention my job.

07:02.749 --> 07:05.273
Look, I just spent the last hour
defending you

07:05.308 --> 07:07.787
to my captain, so do me a favor
and don't look at me

07:07.822 --> 07:09.625
like I'm the one
that's crazy, okay?

07:09.660 --> 07:12.725
I've had enough of that
for one lifetime.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.760
Let's go.

07:14.795 --> 07:17.363
Belief is sanity, Lieutenant.

07:17.397 --> 07:19.699
Now I'm no more eager
to accept it than you,

07:19.733 --> 07:21.267
but if Katrina's warning is real...

07:21.301 --> 07:23.869
and we shall soon find out...

07:23.904 --> 07:28.040
then it appears evil
has found a new home...

07:28.075 --> 07:29.908
in Sleepy Hollow.

07:37.317 --> 07:39.251
(Lights buzzing)

08:07.547 --> 08:09.315
(Clattering)

08:12.085 --> 08:14.487
(Shrieks)
What's happening to me?!

08:14.521 --> 08:16.122
(Speaking Greek)

08:17.991 --> 08:19.325
What is it?

08:19.359 --> 08:22.828
(Speaks Greek)

08:22.863 --> 08:24.330
No, no.

08:24.364 --> 08:26.665

08:39.145 --> 08:41.514
(Speaks Greek)

08:44.951 --> 08:46.852

09:19.870 --> 09:22.604
Okay, let me see if I got this.

09:22.639 --> 09:23.939
When you first met Katrina...

09:23.973 --> 09:25.708
She disliked me intensely.

09:25.742 --> 09:27.276
Because?

09:27.310 --> 09:29.278
That is a discussion
for another day.

09:30.647 --> 09:31.547
Is this correct?

09:31.581 --> 09:34.383
This meal cost $4.95?!

09:34.417 --> 09:36.185
Dear God.

09:36.219 --> 09:38.787
With an additional tax
of 41 cents?

09:38.822 --> 09:41.557
(Chuckles) No, no, don't try
to change the subject.

09:41.591 --> 09:44.760
Somehow you fell in love,
you get married,

09:44.794 --> 09:46.695
but the whole time
you have no idea

09:46.730 --> 09:49.198
that your wife is a witch?

09:49.232 --> 09:51.400
- Correct.
- How could you not know?

09:51.434 --> 09:53.035
When Katrina and I met,
the witch trials...

09:53.069 --> 09:54.870
though less pervasive...
had already taken the lives

09:54.904 --> 09:56.071
of hundreds of women,

09:56.106 --> 09:58.540
so I choose to believe

09:58.575 --> 10:01.977
Katrina withheld the truth
to protect me and herself,

10:02.011 --> 10:04.646
and as we've come to learn,
the fate of the entire country

10:04.681 --> 10:07.182
from those who would do us
considerable harm!

10:07.217 --> 10:09.318
Ah, she was protecting the fate

10:09.352 --> 10:11.387
of the American Revolution.

10:11.421 --> 10:13.555
I understand,
to you it sounds...

10:13.590 --> 10:16.392
Insane, when spoken out loud.

10:16.426 --> 10:20.362
No, what's insane is a
ten-percent levy on baked goods.

10:20.397 --> 10:22.030
You do realize
the Revolutionary War began

10:22.065 --> 10:23.365
on less than two percent?

10:23.400 --> 10:26.902
How is the public not flocking
to the streets in outrage?

10:26.936 --> 10:28.003
We must do something.

10:28.037 --> 10:29.238
(Chuckles)
Here's what we can do.

10:29.272 --> 10:31.006
No more firsthand accounts
of witches

10:31.040 --> 10:33.409
or founding fathers

10:33.443 --> 10:34.877
or donut tax outrage

10:34.911 --> 10:37.613
unless you want to be
sent back to the asylum.

10:37.647 --> 10:39.348
Point taken.

10:39.382 --> 10:40.916
And we will need
to find you a cover.

10:40.950 --> 10:42.785
I'm sure I can muster one up.

10:51.461 --> 10:53.462
(Engine starting)

11:04.840 --> 11:06.642
AUGUST: I'm not asking
if you're qualified.

11:06.776 --> 11:09.545
I'm asking
if you're running away.

11:12.849 --> 11:14.683
(Gasping)

11:14.717 --> 11:17.252
(Thunder crashing)
Oh, my God!

11:17.287 --> 11:18.420
Officer down!

11:18.455 --> 11:19.755
Oh, my God!

11:19.789 --> 11:21.457
Officer down!

11:39.809 --> 11:43.612
What were you trying to tell me,
Katrina?

11:43.646 --> 11:45.180
Please help me understand.

11:54.491 --> 11:56.124
The first dark spirit rises

11:56.159 --> 11:58.560
with the blood moon.
She is one of us.

11:58.561 --> 12:00.969
One of who?

12:01.064 --> 12:02.931
ABBIE:
Crane?

12:02.966 --> 12:05.501
"She's one of us."

12:05.535 --> 12:06.869
Those were her exact words.

12:06.903 --> 12:08.908
What are you talking about?

12:08.943 --> 12:11.807
She was referring to a witch.

13:01.324 --> 13:03.725
(Witch hissing)

13:03.760 --> 13:06.862
He sent me to help you find
the people you're looking for.

13:10.733 --> 13:13.068
And to give you a message.

13:13.102 --> 13:16.772
"The ashes of the pious will
ordain your resurrection.

13:16.806 --> 13:19.241
"Take their flesh...

13:19.275 --> 13:21.209
and you will reclaim yours."

No! No!

15:13.623 --> 15:18.026
♪ Wicked witchcraft... ♪

15:19.361 --> 15:22.035
CRANE: And consider that witches
are known to draw their power

15:22.070 --> 15:23.695
from the lunar cycle.

15:23.730 --> 15:25.400
Oh, does this not concern you?

15:25.435 --> 15:26.635
Of course it does,

15:26.669 --> 15:29.604
but you gotta give me a minute
to find my feet here.

15:29.639 --> 15:31.940
I was on my way to Quantico
two seconds ago

15:31.974 --> 15:35.711
to be a criminal profiler,
and now I am profiling a witch.

15:35.745 --> 15:37.713
It's gonna take a little
catching up for me.

15:37.747 --> 15:39.514
I mean, what, are
we supposed to do,

15:39.549 --> 15:42.617
put out an APB on a woman
with warts and a broom?

15:43.953 --> 15:47.556
Lieutenant, I, too, believed
that we lived in a world

15:47.590 --> 15:51.460
where superstition gave
way to reason and logic...

15:51.494 --> 15:54.730
until General Washington
brought me into a secret war

15:54.764 --> 15:59.568
with forces which, like you,
I'm yet to fully understand.

15:59.602 --> 16:02.370
And even so...

16:02.405 --> 16:04.606
you still doubt your own eyes?

16:04.640 --> 16:07.342
Look, I know what I saw
with you.

16:07.376 --> 16:09.411
I'm not pretending that I didn't,

16:09.445 --> 16:12.447
but usual police procedure isn't
gonna cut it in this case.

16:12.482 --> 16:15.416
You've not had appropriate time
to mourn your sheriff.

16:16.652 --> 16:18.120
Excuse me?

16:18.154 --> 16:21.690
He was more than just a
colleague to you, wasn't he?

16:24.093 --> 16:27.729
The demon you and your sister
saw in the forest,

16:27.764 --> 16:30.031
he believed you.

16:30.066 --> 16:34.836
I saw it in your eyes
at the burial, Ms. Mills.

16:34.871 --> 16:39.074
Please... help me understand.

16:46.182 --> 16:49.951
After Jenny and I saw
that thing...

16:55.424 --> 16:58.293
it got pretty bad for a while.

16:58.327 --> 17:01.563
She was sent to the institution...

17:01.597 --> 17:05.967
and I did a lot of stupid things
to try and shut it all out...

17:06.935 --> 17:08.470
drugs,

17:08.503 --> 17:12.406
me and this guy I was seeing
broke into a pharmacy.

17:12.441 --> 17:14.108
Cop car pulls up,

17:14.143 --> 17:16.478
guy bolts, just gone,

17:16.512 --> 17:19.647
and this sheriff
steps out the cruiser.

17:19.682 --> 17:22.117
I was thinking,
"That's it, I'm going to jail.

17:22.151 --> 17:23.585
My life is over."

17:23.618 --> 17:26.221
But instead of taking me to jail,

17:26.255 --> 17:27.789
he takes me to a diner.

17:27.824 --> 17:29.691
He orders apple pie and says...

17:29.725 --> 17:35.063
You know what I love
about apple pie a la mode?

17:35.097 --> 17:37.032
Where the warm, crunchy crust
comes together

17:37.066 --> 17:39.568
with the smooth,
frozen ice cream.

17:41.003 --> 17:43.738
And in about five minutes,
all the ice cream melts

17:43.773 --> 17:45.340
and becomes a warm soupy mess.

17:45.374 --> 17:48.543
When that happens...

17:48.578 --> 17:50.979
we're leaving.

17:51.013 --> 17:52.480
So you got five minutes

17:52.515 --> 17:54.816
to decide if you're gonna change
your life,

17:54.851 --> 17:56.885
or if I'm taking you to jail.

18:05.361 --> 18:08.163
So I changed...

18:08.197 --> 18:10.432
right there.

18:13.302 --> 18:16.004
I got more fathering
in those five minutes

18:16.038 --> 18:18.874
than I got my whole life.

18:22.812 --> 18:24.880
MAN: (Over radio)
Charlie 101 to Comm.

18:24.914 --> 18:26.615
Hmm.

18:27.817 --> 18:29.851
Go ahead, Charlie 101.

18:29.886 --> 18:32.254
You said to keep a lookout
for any unusual activity?

18:32.288 --> 18:33.755
Well, I think I got something.

18:47.303 --> 18:49.838
Derek, what happened?

18:49.872 --> 18:52.107
We're still putting
the pieces together.

18:52.141 --> 18:53.475
Vic's name is Jeremy Furth.

18:53.509 --> 18:56.877
Looks like something caught fire
inside the vehicle.

19:09.158 --> 19:11.393
What is that?

19:12.428 --> 19:13.795
It looks like...

19:13.829 --> 19:15.397
claw marks or something?

19:15.431 --> 19:18.633
As though someone purposefully
dug into his chest.

19:21.237 --> 19:25.440
The ash within
didn't simply fall away.

19:25.474 --> 19:28.576
It's as though
someone collected something.

19:28.611 --> 19:30.946
Does that mean something
to you?

19:30.980 --> 19:33.281
Indeed.

19:33.316 --> 19:35.350
I believe I know who did this.

19:44.890 --> 19:47.358
What do you mean you
know who did this?

19:47.392 --> 19:49.159
What I'm about to tell you,

19:49.194 --> 19:51.295
I myself would once have dismissed
as superstitious folly,

19:51.329 --> 19:54.265
but that was before
the war began.

19:54.299 --> 19:59.203
One night, my regiment was
returning to camp near Albany.

19:59.237 --> 20:01.939
The moon hung low in its cycle,
as it does now...

20:01.973 --> 20:05.009
a blood moon,
as Katrina described.

20:08.079 --> 20:11.215
The destruction was far too
extensive for common artillery.

20:11.249 --> 20:14.685
There were bodies everywhere.

20:14.719 --> 20:17.421
Our men, reduced to ash,

20:17.455 --> 20:20.591
which gave way
to a darker revelation

20:20.625 --> 20:24.145
as I sensed a presence
in the woods around us.

20:26.163 --> 20:29.300
I could not have told you back then
what it was I saw that night,

20:29.334 --> 20:32.903
but it chilled my blood
like nothing before.

20:34.005 --> 20:37.808
These strange murders
became more frequent.

20:37.842 --> 20:41.078
Soon, a tale spread
of a dark coven...

20:42.280 --> 20:45.649
led by a high priestess
known as Serilda of Abaddon.

20:45.684 --> 20:48.152
General Washington came
to believe the redcoats

20:48.186 --> 20:51.755
had formed a dark alliance
with this sorceress.

20:51.790 --> 20:53.123
Corbin believed that there were

20:53.158 --> 20:54.892
two groups of witches
in Sleepy Hollow...

20:56.094 --> 20:58.262
One good, one evil.

20:58.296 --> 21:01.565
Then our answers must be in the files
he kept hidden in his office.

21:01.599 --> 21:05.803
We must find out how much the
good sheriff actually knew.

21:13.979 --> 21:15.646
Damn it.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.181
They're gone.

21:17.215 --> 21:18.349
Corbin's files.

21:18.383 --> 21:19.817
They've all been moved.

21:19.851 --> 21:21.018
Wait here.

21:21.052 --> 21:22.419
I'll find out where they went.

21:32.897 --> 21:34.631
- May I help you?
- Nope, nope.

21:34.666 --> 21:37.134
Just perusing, thank you.

21:37.168 --> 21:39.135
You're Ichabod Crane.

21:39.537 --> 21:40.771
I am indeed.

21:40.805 --> 21:41.939
And you are...?

21:41.973 --> 21:43.273
You were a suspect
in Corbin's murder.

21:43.308 --> 21:45.876
Wrongfully accused as it were.

21:45.910 --> 21:48.112
And duly released.

21:48.146 --> 21:49.813
So, what are you
still doing here?

21:49.848 --> 21:51.015
I'm a History professor.

21:51.049 --> 21:53.384
- On leave from Oxford.
- Oxford, huh?

21:53.418 --> 21:55.452
You know, I had a cousin
who studied at Oxford.

21:55.487 --> 21:57.388
What did you teach?

21:57.422 --> 21:59.156
Treatises of Civil Government.

21:59.190 --> 22:01.325
With a focus on the
American Revolutionary War.

22:01.359 --> 22:02.626
(Laughs)

22:02.660 --> 22:04.561
That's got to be embarrassing.

22:04.596 --> 22:06.997
You know, teaching a course
about how we kicked your ass.

22:07.032 --> 22:09.400
We?

22:09.434 --> 22:11.368
I didn't realize you were there.

22:11.403 --> 22:12.970
No.

22:13.004 --> 22:15.539
But I was 101st Airborne
in Iraq.

22:15.573 --> 22:18.308
What war did you fight in,
Professor?

22:18.343 --> 22:22.079
One that I pray is never doomed
to repeat itself, sir.

22:23.114 --> 22:25.916
Abbie? Hey.

22:25.950 --> 22:27.117
Hi, Luke.

22:27.152 --> 22:28.218
I see you two have met.

22:28.253 --> 22:30.320
What's he doing here, Ab?

22:30.355 --> 22:32.890
He's consulting to the sheriff's
department on orders from Irving.

22:35.026 --> 22:36.493
We're on the clock.

22:36.528 --> 22:38.062
Talk later, let's go.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.901
Facial expressions
have changed little,

22:43.935 --> 22:46.203
if at all, over the centuries.

22:46.237 --> 22:48.372
Were you and Luke
formerly betrothed?

22:48.406 --> 22:50.274
He's my ex.
We weren't betrothed.

22:50.308 --> 22:51.408
There was no betrothing.

22:51.443 --> 22:52.543
And we've got bigger problems.

22:52.577 --> 22:54.011
The files were moved
to the archives.

22:54.045 --> 22:55.279
I need clearance to get in,

22:55.313 --> 22:57.114
and Irving isn't
answering his phone.

22:57.148 --> 22:58.709
- Where's the building?
- Across the street,

22:58.784 --> 23:01.078
- the one with the guard out front.
- The armory?

23:01.286 --> 23:02.619
I know another way in.

23:02.654 --> 23:04.588
To the basement.

23:04.622 --> 23:07.157
Your affair did not end well,
I take it.

23:07.192 --> 23:08.292
What's in the basement?

23:08.326 --> 23:09.827
I'll show you.

23:09.861 --> 23:12.463
What was the impetus
of your disbandment?

23:12.497 --> 23:14.498
We broke up when I was leaving
for the FBI.

23:14.532 --> 23:17.201
- But you didn't leave.
- Nope.

23:17.235 --> 23:20.170
Then theoretically you could
rekindle the relationship.

23:20.205 --> 23:22.573
I will literally pay you
to stop talking.

23:22.607 --> 23:25.275
I would happily accept because
I am in need of currency.

23:25.310 --> 23:28.679
But since you did not hesitate
to interrogate me about Katrina,

23:28.713 --> 23:31.148
I think I'm entitled to my query.

23:31.182 --> 23:34.351
I believe I'm entitled to tell you
it's my private business.

23:34.385 --> 23:38.422
Well, Sleepy Hollow
is full of secrets.

23:38.456 --> 23:40.457
And now I'm gonna
show you another.

23:42.727 --> 23:44.795
What is this?

23:44.829 --> 23:47.097
It's been sealed off.

23:47.132 --> 23:49.466
What are you doing?

23:50.368 --> 23:52.369
Crane?

23:54.372 --> 23:56.206
Won't be a moment.

23:57.842 --> 23:59.309
Whoa!

23:59.344 --> 24:00.944
Whoa, whoa,
you can't just do that!

24:18.997 --> 24:20.864
What the hell is that?

24:34.812 --> 24:35.913
During the war,

24:35.947 --> 24:38.882
we built a series of
subterranean tunnels

24:38.917 --> 24:40.717
beneath the city...

24:40.752 --> 24:43.854
to allow us
to transport munitions

24:43.888 --> 24:46.056
and supplies in secret.

24:46.090 --> 24:49.526
This entrance...

24:49.561 --> 24:52.663
should connect us directly
to the annex.

24:54.933 --> 24:56.934
Shall we?

25:01.439 --> 25:03.206
Mind the rats.

25:03.241 --> 25:05.409
Yes, I do.

25:09.113 --> 25:12.916
End of that tunnel bares the bones
of convicted witches.

25:12.950 --> 25:15.886
Why are they buried down here?

25:15.920 --> 25:19.456
It was decreed witches were
undeserving of a proper burial.

25:19.490 --> 25:22.225
But Katrina had a headstone.

25:22.260 --> 25:24.227
As we discovered,
an empty grave site.

25:24.262 --> 25:27.697
Used as a ruse to hide
the Horseman's head.

25:27.732 --> 25:29.699
So, her death and remains...?

25:29.734 --> 25:32.302
Her remains...

25:32.336 --> 25:34.604
remain a mystery.

25:38.242 --> 25:41.178
It's all still here.

25:42.213 --> 25:44.347
We coded all of the crates.

25:44.382 --> 25:48.118
BP in red marks black powder.

25:48.152 --> 25:50.187
Does gun powder have
an expiration date?

25:50.221 --> 25:52.322
Best not to tempt fate.

25:54.625 --> 25:57.861
Now, if I'm not mistaken,

25:57.895 --> 25:59.896
the ladder should...

26:00.965 --> 26:02.966
Yes.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.041
(Metallic scraping,
hinges creak)

26:22.587 --> 26:25.822
The Battle of Lexington
was plotted in this chamber.

26:25.857 --> 26:27.691
Well, now it's where
hard copies go to die.

26:27.725 --> 26:30.827
Another figure of speech,
I take it?

26:30.862 --> 26:32.696
All police reports,
newspaper articles,

26:32.730 --> 26:34.197
historical records.

26:34.232 --> 26:36.032
Pretty much everything
we'd ever really want to know

26:36.067 --> 26:37.767
about the history
of Sleepy Hollow.

26:37.802 --> 26:39.870
Recorded history.

26:39.904 --> 26:41.705
It appears little
of what actually transpired

26:41.739 --> 26:43.974
found its way
into your textbooks.

26:44.008 --> 26:46.209
Got it... Corbin's files.

26:56.187 --> 26:57.554
We better split this up.

27:15.473 --> 27:18.008
Careful, kid.

27:18.042 --> 27:21.545
Imagine how your mom and dad
would feel if you got run over.

27:21.579 --> 27:23.547
Uh, my dad's dead.

27:24.949 --> 27:26.950
My sympathies.

27:28.653 --> 27:29.853
What's your name?

27:29.887 --> 27:32.022
You can tell me.

27:32.056 --> 27:33.490
I'm a police officer.

27:33.524 --> 27:34.658
Kyle.

27:36.060 --> 27:37.727
Kyle what?

27:37.762 --> 27:38.995
I need to hear it.

27:39.030 --> 27:41.264
Ky-Kyle Hemmington.

27:41.299 --> 27:42.899
(Sighs)

27:42.934 --> 27:45.368
It's a nice name.

27:45.403 --> 27:47.971
I'm sorry it had to be yours.

27:51.576 --> 27:54.311
Go inside, Kyle.

27:54.345 --> 27:55.712
It's getting dark.

27:59.881 --> 28:01.569
Serilda of Abaddon.

28:01.605 --> 28:03.157
Abaddon...
Is that a place?

28:03.287 --> 28:05.355
No, it's a form of Romani Greek.

28:05.389 --> 28:08.725
Otherwise referred to as
the language of the Gypsies.

28:08.759 --> 28:11.027
- You speak Greek?
- Among several languages, yes.

28:11.062 --> 28:12.362
My memory's eidetic.

28:12.396 --> 28:14.397
I retain what I see
with near perfect precision.

28:14.432 --> 28:15.932
You have photographic memory?

28:15.967 --> 28:18.868
Sights, sounds, even smells.

28:18.903 --> 28:20.303
Except, ironically,

28:20.338 --> 28:23.006
for the 250 years
I can't seem to recall,

28:23.040 --> 28:24.274
which makes it of little use.

28:24.308 --> 28:26.409
Ah, here we are.

28:26.444 --> 28:29.579
It appears Serilda's fate
was sealed by her enemies.

28:29.614 --> 28:31.147
A benevolent coven

28:31.182 --> 28:33.316
known as Sisterhood
of the Radiant Heart.

28:33.351 --> 28:35.285
Their leader used white magic

28:35.319 --> 28:38.254
to weaken Serilda,
making her vulnerable

28:38.289 --> 28:40.290
to mortal attack.

28:41.192 --> 28:43.493
A hunting party
finally captured her

28:43.527 --> 28:45.962
in the woods
around Sleepy Hollow.

28:50.075 --> 28:51.633
MAGISTRATE:
You are condemned,

28:51.668 --> 28:54.004
and you will burn.

28:54.038 --> 28:55.338
(Townspeople cheer, shout)

28:55.373 --> 28:57.340
Have you last words?

28:57.375 --> 29:00.020
(Speaking Greek)

29:00.045 --> 29:03.546
CRANE: In Romani Greek, she said,
"By the turn of the blood moon,

29:03.581 --> 29:06.483
"the ashes of your ancestry
will be mine.

29:06.517 --> 29:08.018
"Your flesh will be my flesh.

29:08.052 --> 29:10.820
I will live again."

29:16.127 --> 29:18.161
(Screaming):
No!

29:18.195 --> 29:20.530
No, no!

29:20.564 --> 29:23.299
The magistrate
who sentenced her,

29:23.334 --> 29:24.501
what was his name?

29:24.535 --> 29:25.568
Uh, let's see...

29:25.603 --> 29:27.037
Robert Daniel Furth.

29:27.071 --> 29:30.340
The victim in the car accident,
his name was Jeremy Furth.

29:30.374 --> 29:33.243
"The ashes of your ancestors
will be mine."

29:33.277 --> 29:36.680
She requires the ashes of his
descendants to return to life.

29:36.714 --> 29:37.447
Jeremy's a descendant.

29:37.481 --> 29:39.449
But surely not the last.

29:39.483 --> 29:41.418
"She must complete
her resurrection

29:41.452 --> 29:44.320
by the turn of the blood moon."

29:44.355 --> 29:45.522
That's tonight.

29:45.556 --> 29:48.458
We must find out
who she'll seek out next.

29:53.230 --> 29:54.731
Good night, sweetheart.

29:54.765 --> 29:56.866
Good night.

30:04.954 --> 30:06.980
According to genealogical records,

30:07.011 --> 30:08.712
the magistrate had a son

30:08.746 --> 30:10.613
whose bloodline traces
to Jeremy Furth.

30:10.648 --> 30:13.550
He also had a daughter who
married into another family.

30:13.584 --> 30:14.951
The Hemmingtons.

30:14.985 --> 30:16.720
Did you locate
Miss Hemmington's descendants?

30:16.754 --> 30:18.888
Only one in Sleepy Hollow.
On Bedford.

30:19.957 --> 30:21.124
(Siren wailing)

30:21.158 --> 30:22.992
(Tires screeching)

30:32.436 --> 30:33.436
(Meows)

30:35.706 --> 30:37.273
(Meows)

30:42.079 --> 30:44.080
Mom?

30:54.625 --> 30:56.626
(Wood creaking)

31:01.232 --> 31:03.233
Mom?

31:05.169 --> 31:07.170
(Wind whistling)

31:13.511 --> 31:15.478
Mom?

31:15.513 --> 31:17.514
(Wind whistling)

31:31.757 --> 31:33.758
(Classical music playing)

31:35.394 --> 31:37.562
(Screaming nearby)

31:37.596 --> 31:39.997
(Gasps)

31:44.636 --> 31:46.070
Kyle!

31:47.105 --> 31:49.106
Kyle!

31:50.943 --> 31:53.077
- (Screams)
- Ma'am, it's okay.

31:53.111 --> 31:54.512
- I'm with the sheriff's department.
- My son.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.247
- There may be an intruder in your home.
- He was screaming.

31:56.281 --> 31:58.865
- Where's my son?!
- KYLE: Mom!

32:01.019 --> 32:03.154
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.

32:04.433 --> 32:06.088
Mom, I saw a woman

32:06.123 --> 32:07.762
and she looked like
she was on fire.

32:07.797 --> 32:09.674
- No, you were scared when you went to bed.
- No, no, I swear!

32:09.709 --> 32:11.596
I think you're just imagining things.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.764
- She was on fire, I swear!
- Honey!

32:13.799 --> 32:16.067
I saw her.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.069
Pardon me.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.904
Has an object been removed
from the shelf?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.207
Oh, my God.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.610
My husband's urn.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.945
But the boy is

32:27.980 --> 32:29.947
the last remaining Hemmington
by blood, is he not?

32:29.982 --> 32:31.048
No, Kyle's adopted.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.251
My husband was the
last Hemmington.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.519
Why?

32:36.421 --> 32:37.955
There's little time left.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.423
The blood moon hangs low,

32:39.458 --> 32:41.726
and now Serilda has the ashes
of the last known descendants.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.794
Let's say we catch
this Sarilda of Abaddon

32:43.829 --> 32:45.329
before the blood moon sets.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.497
Then what, we kill her?

32:46.531 --> 32:48.032
How? She's already dead.

32:48.066 --> 32:51.302
She can only be made whole
during the blood moon.

32:51.336 --> 32:54.405
We must find her before
she completes her resurrection

32:54.439 --> 32:57.608
and return her to the ashes
from whence she came.

32:57.643 --> 32:58.943
Meaning we burn her
to the ground.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.444
Oh, with great enthusiasm.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.612
(Mocking British accent):
Jolly good.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.980
Let's set her aflame
and bury her bones

33:03.015 --> 33:05.116
where she'll never find them.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.751
The tunnels.

33:07.452 --> 33:08.452
Of course.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.021
Her bones will be buried
in the tunnels

33:10.055 --> 33:11.155
with the other witches.

33:11.189 --> 33:13.124
She needs them to return
to flesh and blood.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.425
(Engine starting)

33:14.459 --> 33:16.093
And that was not
an accurate impersonation.

33:30.475 --> 33:32.410
No, really.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.679
I don't need any help,
as long as you're comfortable.

33:34.713 --> 33:37.315
(Panting)

33:37.349 --> 33:40.017
It's been, what, 250 years?

33:40.052 --> 33:41.352
Maybe we've got the wrong spot.

33:51.163 --> 33:52.129
(Grunts)

33:52.164 --> 33:53.130
Heh.

33:53.165 --> 33:55.533
(Breathing hard)

33:55.567 --> 33:57.335
You're welcome.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.337
(Metallic banging)

34:11.350 --> 34:14.385
Oh, no, we're too late.

34:14.418 --> 34:16.754
- She's already found them.
- She's in here somewhere.

34:16.788 --> 34:17.987
We'll cover more ground
if we separate.

34:18.023 --> 34:19.757
Take this.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.659
Just aim

34:21.693 --> 34:22.993
and pull the trigger.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.596
Yes, I do recall how to
use a firearm, thank you.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.328
(Chanting in Greek)

35:57.912 --> 36:00.246
(Hissing)

36:00.281 --> 36:02.382
(Gunshot)

36:04.418 --> 36:05.418
(Gun thuds on floor)

36:08.123 --> 36:10.857
Crane?

36:11.792 --> 36:14.027
The crates.

36:16.699 --> 36:19.149
Crane, your gun!

36:23.971 --> 36:25.605
What are you doing?
You dropped your gun.

36:25.639 --> 36:26.606
It was empty.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.408
You only fired one shot.

36:28.442 --> 36:29.909
It has more?

36:29.944 --> 36:31.811
Yes, Crane, a lot more.

36:31.846 --> 36:33.613
Well, much like the Horseman,

36:33.647 --> 36:35.215
it appears madam here
is rather fond of bullets

36:35.249 --> 36:37.083
and does not die by them.

36:42.189 --> 36:45.625
(Speaking Greek)

36:45.659 --> 36:46.826
What's she saying?

37:01.442 --> 37:03.176
Go. Go!

37:05.980 --> 37:07.914
Brace yourself.

37:10.317 --> 37:11.251
Crane.

37:11.285 --> 37:12.252
Patience.

37:14.121 --> 37:15.688
Crane!

37:18.125 --> 37:19.792
Get down!

37:23.664 --> 37:26.120
Oh, for the love of...

37:27.201 --> 37:29.202
(Explosion)

37:39.721 --> 37:41.901
Lieutenant?

37:58.265 --> 38:00.266
(Siren whoops)

38:03.871 --> 38:06.973
CRANE: She called it
"the world between worlds,"

38:07.007 --> 38:09.142
and whatever it is,

38:09.176 --> 38:12.211
if Katrina's imprisoned there,

38:12.246 --> 38:14.246
perhaps she can be freed.

38:15.382 --> 38:19.185
I am so far down
the rabbit hole here.

38:19.219 --> 38:21.821
I never thought I'd say this,
not in a million years,

38:21.855 --> 38:26.325
but I just want to go back
to the way it was before.

38:27.127 --> 38:29.128
I'm afraid neither of us can.

38:31.365 --> 38:33.499
But I do take comfort

38:33.534 --> 38:38.104
knowing that this strange road
we find ourselves on...

38:38.138 --> 38:40.406
can only be traveled together.

38:41.942 --> 38:44.544
I think we could both
use some morning cheer.

38:44.578 --> 38:46.579
Coffee?

39:13.374 --> 39:15.682
You look lost, kid.

39:15.717 --> 39:18.594
What is this?

39:19.312 --> 39:20.479
I'm dreaming, right?

39:20.514 --> 39:23.015
Well, what difference
does that make?

39:23.049 --> 39:25.284
I'm here right now, aren't I?
With you?

39:28.589 --> 39:31.790
Look, if you're gonna haunt me,
be helpful.

39:31.825 --> 39:34.126
Okay?

39:34.160 --> 39:36.729
Okay.

39:36.763 --> 39:38.464
What seems to be the problem?

39:38.498 --> 39:39.498
(Exhales)

39:39.533 --> 39:41.267
"What seems to be the problem?"

39:41.301 --> 39:43.469
How about, what the hell
is happening here?

39:43.503 --> 39:45.471
You were ahead of me
the whole time.

39:45.505 --> 39:47.406
Were you ever planning
on telling me anything?

39:47.440 --> 39:48.607
Would you have believed me
if I did?

39:48.642 --> 39:49.975
- Maybe.
- Maybe not.

39:51.111 --> 39:52.878
You spent a lot of time
running away

39:52.913 --> 39:54.346
from what happened to you,
Abbie.

39:56.416 --> 39:58.417
I asked you to be helpful.

40:00.086 --> 40:01.787
I don't know how to do this.

40:01.821 --> 40:04.523
- You're scared, aren't you?
- Scared?

40:04.558 --> 40:06.358
Yeah.

40:06.393 --> 40:07.860
I'm furious.

40:07.894 --> 40:11.230
- And outraged that you didn't tell me...
- Good. That's progress.

40:11.264 --> 40:15.267
Ever since you were little,
you let your life be ruled by fear.

40:16.970 --> 40:19.038
You're so afraid of
what you don't understand

40:19.072 --> 40:22.041
that it kept you from seeing
who you really are.

40:22.075 --> 40:24.209
What you were meant to do.

40:24.244 --> 40:26.178
Which is...?

40:26.212 --> 40:27.713
The only person
that can tell you that...

40:27.747 --> 40:28.981
is you.

40:31.017 --> 40:33.285
That's what faith is, honey.

40:34.955 --> 40:37.456
I really miss you.

40:42.696 --> 40:45.330
Don't be afraid of number 49.

40:46.366 --> 40:48.467
That's where you'll find
you're not alone.

40:53.073 --> 40:54.907
CRANE:
Lieutenant.

40:57.410 --> 40:59.878
Are you all right?

41:10.557 --> 41:12.558
(Breathing hard)

41:17.364 --> 41:19.098
Tonight, Mills.

41:19.132 --> 41:21.667
(Exhales)

41:25.105 --> 41:27.239
Seen any more monsters lately,
Jenny?

41:28.709 --> 41:31.176
No, ma'am.

41:31.211 --> 41:33.430
Not since I've been taking these.

41:40.954 --> 41:42.855
Open.

41:45.592 --> 41:47.226
Good girl.

41:47.260 --> 41:49.194
Lights out in five minutes.
