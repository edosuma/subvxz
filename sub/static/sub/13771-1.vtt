WEBVTT

00:02.219 --> 00:04.482
So, after I was indicted,
my wife lost her job

00:04.569 --> 00:06.615
and had a nervous breakdown,

00:06.702 --> 00:08.573
and if that wasn't bad enough,

00:08.660 --> 00:10.662
one of our sons stole
his brother's girlfriend,

00:10.749 --> 00:11.924
which madehim run away
from home and join the Army.

00:12.012 --> 00:12.751
Left, right...

00:12.838 --> 00:14.318
[grunting]

00:15.841 --> 00:17.539
We don't even know where he is.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.367
We've entered
Afghani airspace.

00:19.454 --> 00:23.327
Remember, pull the green cord
before the light green cord.

00:23.414 --> 00:26.635
We're just worried
sick about him.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.594
It's just that you feel
so helpless, you know?

00:29.681 --> 00:32.249
Look, I don't set
the prices, mister.

00:32.336 --> 00:35.165
They're four bucks a box.
Take it or leave it.

00:35.252 --> 00:36.079
Oh, all right.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.255

to be tuna surprise.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.771
It can be chicken
surprise, or beef,

01:15.858 --> 01:18.339
but there will be
a surprise involved.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.515
You know, we can wait
for Mom to make dinner.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.386
I'm sorry, she went to talk

01:22.473 --> 01:24.301
with some Army
administrator about Reese.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.650
She'll be gone for hours.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.217
LOIS:
Get your hands off me!

01:27.304 --> 01:28.523
Your authority stops

01:28.610 --> 01:30.307
at my property line!

01:36.444 --> 01:37.314
What did she do?

01:37.401 --> 01:38.794
She completely

01:38.881 --> 01:40.143
destroyed an office,
made explicit threats

01:40.230 --> 01:42.058
against the United States Army,

01:42.145 --> 01:44.974
attacked my groinage region,
and captured same.

01:45.061 --> 01:47.629
Uh... Listen,
maybe there's a way

01:47.716 --> 01:49.805
we can make
this whole thing go away.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.372
Sir,

01:51.459 --> 01:53.287
if she comes
within 500 feet of my perimeter

01:53.374 --> 01:56.072
I've been given
the authority to engage.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.943
Mom, what happened?

01:58.030 --> 02:00.859
I'll tell you what happened.

02:00.946 --> 02:03.906
I told them how my underage son
ran away and joined the Army

02:03.993 --> 02:06.169
under false pretenses
and was sent off to combat,

02:06.256 --> 02:07.779
and you know
what they said?

02:07.866 --> 02:10.520
They said if you can
find out what name he used,

02:10.608 --> 02:12.697
they can have him
back to us in six months.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.612
Six months!

02:14.699 --> 02:17.876
They'll have him
back to us in six months?

02:17.963 --> 02:19.313
-HAL: Honey...
-I don't know if she's upset

02:19.400 --> 02:20.662
he's gonna get killed,

02:20.749 --> 02:22.098
or mad someone else
is gonna do it.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.578
HAL: Try to relax.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.275
Honey, you know, you're
gonna lose a nail

02:25.362 --> 02:26.581
inside your palm again.

02:26.668 --> 02:27.712
Just calm down
and let the Army...

02:27.799 --> 02:29.192
I don't trust the Army,

02:29.279 --> 02:31.107
which means this family
has to find him,

02:31.194 --> 02:33.936
and I don't trust this family,
which means I have to find him!

02:36.504 --> 02:38.288
Two Purple Hearts
and a Bronze Star?

02:38.375 --> 02:39.898
And he blubbered
like a baby.

02:39.985 --> 02:41.117
MALCOLM: The Army.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.074
What do you expect
of people

02:42.162 --> 02:42.814
who would give Reese a gun?

02:42.901 --> 02:44.773
Oh, that's right.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.601
It's the Army's fault
if your brother gets killed.

02:46.688 --> 02:49.038
Now, Lois, we can't blame
Malcolm for stealing

02:49.125 --> 02:51.562
Reese's girl and causing this
whole mess in the first place.

02:51.649 --> 02:52.955
Huh?

02:53.042 --> 02:55.087
Kids his age are nothing
but raging hormones

02:55.175 --> 02:57.002
and hideous self-involvement.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.874
They are all
amoral little creeps.

02:58.961 --> 03:00.310
Don't defend him, Hal.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.094
Just help me make dinner.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.403
[pans clanging]

03:06.490 --> 03:08.057
Great, angry meat loaf.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.059
Thanks a lot.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.150
We don't have
to worry about Reese.

03:14.237 --> 03:18.372
All he has to do is lay low
and not do anything stupid.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.069
Oh, God.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.421
REESE: I'm a lean, mean
fighting machine.

03:24.508 --> 03:27.032
I'm a lean,
mean fighting machine.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.338
I'm a robot.

03:28.425 --> 03:31.385
Robots are cool.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.735
Green Lantern fought a robot.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.737
I love Green Lantern.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.043
I love pie.

03:38.130 --> 03:43.005
Pie... Pie... Pie.

03:43.092 --> 03:45.094
Why am I thinking about pie?

03:45.181 --> 03:47.270
I'm supposed to be thinking
about something else.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.098
Does it rhyme with "pie"?

03:49.185 --> 03:50.012
Buy?

03:50.099 --> 03:51.231
Cry?

03:51.318 --> 03:52.232
Die?

03:52.319 --> 03:53.189
High?

03:53.276 --> 03:54.190
Pie?

03:54.277 --> 03:55.931
Pie!

03:56.018 --> 03:57.237
No...

03:57.324 --> 03:58.368
Pie?

03:58.455 --> 03:59.369
Green Lantern.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.892
Fighting robot.

04:00.979 --> 04:01.763
Fighting machine.

04:01.850 --> 04:02.807
Me...

04:02.894 --> 04:05.114
I'm a fighting machine.

04:05.201 --> 04:07.551
I'm a lean, mean
fighting machine.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.684
I'm a lean,
mean fighting machine.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.903
[automatic weapons firing,
men shouting indistinctly]

04:13.165 --> 04:15.167

04:21.738 --> 04:22.740
[screams]

04:28.180 --> 04:30.618
DEWEY: What is that?

04:30.705 --> 04:33.011
I made a list of
every bad thing

04:33.098 --> 04:34.143
Reese ever did to me.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.579
A list?

04:35.666 --> 04:37.364
I'm sick of having
to defend myself!

04:37.451 --> 04:38.626
No matter what
I did to Reese,

04:38.713 --> 04:40.149
he's done way
worse stuff to me,

04:40.236 --> 04:42.804
and it's all here
on this list.

04:42.891 --> 04:45.241
So we're admitting
we have lists?

04:49.985 --> 04:52.292
Mine starts January '95.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.380
When does yours start?

04:53.467 --> 04:57.514
Uh... October 3, 1996:

04:57.601 --> 04:59.386
my first
knuckle pizza.

04:59.473 --> 05:02.737
July 10, 1997:
my first atomic swirly.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.608
The big bruise of '99.

05:04.695 --> 05:07.655
"Backyard Dentist,"
"Lighter Fluid Donut."

05:07.742 --> 05:10.048
That's worse than stealing
a girlfriend, right?

05:10.135 --> 05:11.485
I don't know...
were you in love

05:11.572 --> 05:13.225
for the first time
with that donut?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.184
Shut up, Dewey.
I had every right.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.534
In fact, I owe him.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.275
So you're saying if he dies,
then you'll be even?

05:19.362 --> 05:20.972
I didn't say he
was going to die!

05:21.059 --> 05:23.801
Malcolm, he almost killed
himself with Bisquick once.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.063
I'm just saying
he deserves

05:25.150 --> 05:27.022
whatever he gets.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.939
No, he doesn't.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.593
That's something
Reese would say.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.290
I'm not Reese.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.248
Just because he's horrible
doesn't mean I have to be.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.902
I'm better than that.

05:37.989 --> 05:41.341
Wow, for a brother-killer,
you sure are conceited.

05:44.474 --> 05:45.780
Oh, uh, excuse me.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.085
Hi, uh, Sergeant Rick.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.696
I'm wondering if
you can help me.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.567
My son is underaged,

05:50.654 --> 05:52.439
and I-I think you
may have recruited him.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.266
Take a look.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.572
Oh, yeah, Private Jetson.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.400
Oh! Yeah.

05:57.487 --> 05:58.923
SGT. RICK:
Yeah, let's see, uh...

05:59.010 --> 06:00.403
he was sent
to Fort Roberts.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.622
I'll get you
the address.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.363
Oh, I really appreciate this.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.669
I just don't understand
what would make him go and do

06:05.756 --> 06:07.758
-a crazy thing like this.
-Well, the truth is

06:07.845 --> 06:10.021
is today's Army's
a pretty attractive package.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.327
Competitive salaries,

06:11.414 --> 06:14.243
health benefits,
college tuition...

06:14.330 --> 06:15.679
Lois, I didn't sign anything.

06:15.766 --> 06:16.854
Just hear me out.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.552
It's only two
weekends a month,

06:18.639 --> 06:21.206
plus we might qualify
for a housing allowance.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.731
Okay, there's a slight
possibility of active duty,

06:23.818 --> 06:26.037
but Sergeant Rick expects
global events to stabilize

06:26.124 --> 06:27.865
in the next
three months.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.748
MALCOLM:
Excuse me.

06:40.835 --> 06:43.359
-What do you want?
-I'm Malcolm.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.274
I'm here Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, 3:00 to 7:00.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.276
No one volunteers here.

06:47.363 --> 06:48.669
They're all signing up

06:48.756 --> 06:50.584
for the glamour jobs
at the burn unit.

06:50.671 --> 06:53.369
I just want to do something
to help veterans.

06:53.456 --> 06:56.720
Really? You think you can handle
helping around here?

06:56.807 --> 06:59.419
How 'bout trying to give
Mr. Skoros a sponge bath?

07:02.944 --> 07:03.945
Sure.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.818
Or maybe you'd prefer to clip
Mr. Ditmar's toenails.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.561
Okay.

07:11.648 --> 07:12.867
Or how 'bout going
room to room,

07:12.954 --> 07:15.130
emptying bed pans
and stanching bed sores?

07:15.217 --> 07:18.655
You know, I think I can save us
both a little time here.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.352
This is how I see it
playing out:

07:20.440 --> 07:21.702
you're going
to keep thinking

07:21.789 --> 07:23.138
of worse and worse
jobs for me to do.

07:23.225 --> 07:24.400
And you know what?
I'm going to do them.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.271
All of them,
no matter what.

07:26.358 --> 07:27.403
Why? It doesn't matter.

07:27.490 --> 07:28.665
I have my reasons.

07:28.752 --> 07:31.102
So go ahead,
knock yourself out.

07:31.189 --> 07:34.802
Well, it kind of takes some
of the fun out of it, but okay.

07:34.889 --> 07:37.457
You can start the afternoon
enemas with Mr. Klegman.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.329
It'll be my pleasure.

07:41.591 --> 07:44.899
[men laughing and chattering]

08:17.540 --> 08:19.150
Well, ma'am,
how can I help you?

08:19.237 --> 08:20.978
It's about my son, Reese.

08:21.065 --> 08:24.329
Um, I think you know him
as Private Jetson.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.072
Private Jetson.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.422
Ma'am, let me
shake your hand.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.337
This boy is the finest soldier

08:32.424 --> 08:34.078
that this old
dogface ever

08:34.164 --> 08:35.558
had the privilege of commanding.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.342
I wish I had a hundred
more just like him.

08:37.429 --> 08:38.692
He's a fine boy.

08:38.779 --> 08:42.043
Yes, well...
we think so, too.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.523
I'd be proud to help you
in any way that I can.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.915
Now you just name it.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.004
The problem is he joined
under false pretenses.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.441
He ran away; he's not even
18 years old yet.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.095
We need to know
where he is

08:51.182 --> 08:53.445
so we can find him
and bring him back home.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.796
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can't help you.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.189
That's classified.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.148
If your son were
on a secret mission,

09:00.235 --> 09:02.629
which I'm not saying he is
nor that one exists,

09:02.716 --> 09:04.761
it would compromise
said mission...

09:04.848 --> 09:07.198
if indeed there were one.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.331
My hands are tied.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.813
You know, Sergeant,

09:12.900 --> 09:14.728
you and I aren't
so different.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.251
I mean, if you
think about it,

09:16.338 --> 09:18.253
we both have the same job.

09:18.340 --> 09:21.473
Taking a bunch of mindless,
irresponsible teenagers

09:21.561 --> 09:22.605
and turning them
into something

09:22.692 --> 09:24.476
vaguely useful
to the world.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.956
It is a challenge, ma'am.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.393
[chuckles]
Last week, one of my boys

09:28.480 --> 09:31.048
was trying to iron his shirt
while he was still in it.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.876
One of mine interrupted
a war game

09:32.963 --> 09:36.097
because his rifle was kind of
digging into his shoulder.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.577
[chuckling]

09:37.664 --> 09:38.882
Did you make
everyone suffer

09:38.969 --> 09:40.231
for what
the one kid did?

09:40.318 --> 09:41.450
Of course.

09:41.537 --> 09:42.886
But it never lasts,
does it?

09:42.973 --> 09:45.976
It is stunning how much
punishment they require.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.325
Tell me about it.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.936
I'm amazed I get
anything else done.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.548
Did you ever try
the opposite?

09:52.635 --> 09:54.028
What do you mean?

09:54.115 --> 09:56.291
Give one of them special
privileges for no reason.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.380
Now, how does that work?

09:58.467 --> 09:59.947
It's really pretty neat.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.514
The others don't know why
he got special privileges

10:02.602 --> 10:04.908
so they start doing everything
right just to catch up.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.867
Then the one you singled
out starts getting

10:06.954 --> 10:08.346
suspicious and paranoid

10:08.433 --> 10:10.131
and he starts informing
on the stragglers.

10:10.218 --> 10:11.349
That sounds pretty good.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.003
You mind if I steal
that one?

10:13.090 --> 10:14.352
Yeah, be my guest.

10:14.439 --> 10:15.658
You know another
good one?

10:15.745 --> 10:17.791
Let them pick punishments
for each other.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.183
It exercises
their creativity

10:19.270 --> 10:20.924
and keeps them from
ganging up on you.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.360
-Nice.
-You can also

10:22.447 --> 10:23.927
take their breakfast,
lunch and dinner,

10:24.014 --> 10:25.581
put it the blender
and grind it up

10:25.668 --> 10:26.669
into a gray paste.

10:26.756 --> 10:27.539
Eventually, they eat it.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.759
That's kind of fun.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.500
You are an artist.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.590
No, I'm just
a talented amateur.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.679
[sighs]

10:36.766 --> 10:38.420
I wish I could help you.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.077
I wish I could just
open this drawer up

10:43.164 --> 10:45.427
and show you
the information you need.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.081
But I can't.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.561
It's got me so frustrated

10:49.649 --> 10:52.173
that I just want to stare
intently out this window

10:52.260 --> 10:53.870
for, oh, say...

10:53.957 --> 10:56.046
120 seconds.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.182
[speaking Farsi]

11:15.283 --> 11:17.285
What is wrong with these guys?
They're just like zombies.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.069
It's the medication
that makes them that way.

11:19.156 --> 11:21.463
Except for Kowalski.
I mean, he came to us like that.

11:21.550 --> 11:24.205
Look, I don't think you
should be giving them so much.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.815
I was reading to Donaldson
for a half an hour,

11:25.902 --> 11:27.469
then a bee crawled out
of his nose.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.036
Believe me, it's better
for everyone

11:29.123 --> 11:31.603
to keep these men
as calm as possible.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.916
Hey, Ed, you want to play?

11:41.613 --> 11:42.876
Here we go.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.225
You know what, Ed?

11:44.312 --> 11:45.443
You can do this.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.881
I believe in
you, all right?

11:47.968 --> 11:49.621
I'm here to help you,
however long it takes.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.582
Maybe you feel ignored here.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.149
Maybe you feel
like you don't exist.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.586
I know you exist, Ed.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.196
Let me help you.

12:00.110 --> 12:02.809
[pop, Ed choking]

12:02.896 --> 12:03.940
[Malcolm gasps]

12:04.027 --> 12:05.768
[talking baby talk]

12:05.855 --> 12:08.336
Where have you been?

12:08.423 --> 12:09.772
You've been gone all day.
You haven't called.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.340
I've been worried sick
about you.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.733
Well, I have to eat, Lois.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.299
I'm a human being.

12:15.386 --> 12:16.474
I'm sorry I'm so late.

12:16.561 --> 12:17.911
I had to take
the bus home.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.608
I sold the car.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.088
I bought a plane
ticket to Kabul.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.654
There's $400 left.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.917
I'd give it to you to
pay down the Visa bill,

12:24.004 --> 12:25.179
but I need it for bribes.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.093
What?!

12:26.180 --> 12:27.834
I'm gonna go get him.

12:27.921 --> 12:28.965
What are you talking about?

12:29.052 --> 12:30.401
You can't just
go get him.

12:30.488 --> 12:31.968
Yes, I can.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.753
Tonight, I'm gonna buy
enough frozen dinners

12:33.840 --> 12:35.537
to last you and the boys
for three weeks.

12:35.624 --> 12:37.408
Then tomorrow,
I'm flying to Kabul.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.149
If I don't get anywhere
with the Army,

12:39.236 --> 12:41.151
I'll hire an interpreter
and get the locals to help me.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.066
If I have to, I'll make
friends with a warlord.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.372
Those guys are
pretty organized.

12:44.459 --> 12:45.590
I'll find him, Hal.

12:45.677 --> 12:46.983
And when does the little bird

12:47.070 --> 12:48.680
pop out of your head
and start singing?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.204
This is what's
happening, Hal.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.901
Lois...

12:51.988 --> 12:53.511
you can't do this.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.647
At some point, you
have to check your ego

12:58.734 --> 13:00.127
and leave it to
the professionals.

13:00.214 --> 13:01.911
I can't!

13:01.998 --> 13:04.871
Lois, you have this reckless,
crazy belief in yourself

13:04.958 --> 13:06.568
that lets you do amazing things.

13:06.655 --> 13:09.005
It's something this family
has always depended on.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.137
I would be
lost without it,

13:10.224 --> 13:11.921
but sometimes that reckless,

13:12.008 --> 13:14.097
crazy belief is just, just...

13:14.184 --> 13:16.404
reckless and crazy.

13:16.491 --> 13:17.971
You've got to accept

13:18.058 --> 13:19.842
that some people can do things
that you can't.

13:19.929 --> 13:20.930
Heart surgeons,

13:21.017 --> 13:22.192
rocket scientists,

13:22.279 --> 13:23.672
that lady at the mall

13:23.759 --> 13:25.021
who carves your name
into a grain of rice.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.370
How does she do that?

13:26.457 --> 13:27.763
No one knows.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.809
Honey, honey, look...

13:31.811 --> 13:34.683
I am giving you permission
not to be omnipotent.

13:34.770 --> 13:38.078
I know it's gonna be hard,
but everything will be okay.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.688
I know it will.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.476
[engine humming]

13:47.130 --> 13:49.611
Sarsi or Diet Sarsi?

13:54.529 --> 13:55.835
[bird screeching]

14:01.710 --> 14:04.495
[whimpering]
I can't do it.

14:04.582 --> 14:05.583
[inhales wheezily]

14:05.670 --> 14:07.237
I can't go on.

14:09.239 --> 14:12.721
MAN: Is this any way
to start your morning?

14:12.808 --> 14:14.984
[family laughing,
birds tweeting]

14:16.333 --> 14:18.248
Mr. Waffles?

14:21.817 --> 14:23.819
Reese, you can't give up!

14:23.906 --> 14:25.038
You got
to keep going.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.996
You got to keep trying!

14:27.083 --> 14:29.694
You don't know
what I've been through.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.958
I've been shot at, chased,

14:32.045 --> 14:34.134
married...

14:34.221 --> 14:36.745
and when the guy found out
I was a dude,

14:36.832 --> 14:38.703
it wasn't
like a total deal breaker.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.357
Son, I know it's hard.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.794
But everything worth
doing is hard.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.101
When third quarter profits
were down,

14:45.188 --> 14:46.537
did Mr. Waffles give up?

14:46.624 --> 14:48.278
No, he did not.

14:48.365 --> 14:51.281
He put more lip-smacking delight
in every bite!

14:51.368 --> 14:53.327
I don't think I can move.

14:53.414 --> 14:54.894
You have to move, Reese!

14:54.981 --> 14:56.896
You have to get home
to your family and friends

14:56.983 --> 14:58.288
and your country.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.812
These people have no idea
what breakfast is.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.293
They take rice
from the night before

15:03.380 --> 15:05.817
and cook it up
into a thin paste.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.994
Is that your idea of breakfast?

15:08.081 --> 15:09.865
No, but...

15:09.952 --> 15:13.434
Do you ever want to taste
my buttery goodness again?

15:13.521 --> 15:14.565
You know I do.

15:14.652 --> 15:15.436
Reese,

15:15.523 --> 15:16.785
listen to me.

15:16.872 --> 15:19.222
I now have 20% more blueberries

15:19.309 --> 15:20.658
in every box.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.269
My legs.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.923
They plump up in the batter!

15:25.141 --> 15:27.970
They're so juicy that way!

15:28.057 --> 15:29.841
[panting]

15:29.929 --> 15:32.322
I'm coming home!

15:32.409 --> 15:34.368
I'm proud of you, son.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.718
Whatever happened
to Mrs. Waffles?

15:36.805 --> 15:37.893
She was hot.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.590
Yes, she was.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.897
But she didn't increase
product awareness

15:41.984 --> 15:44.508
in girls three to 18
a single percent.

15:44.595 --> 15:48.164
[train whistle blows]

15:52.516 --> 15:53.953
[goat bleating]

16:21.806 --> 16:23.460
Nurse Peterson,
you'll be interested to know

16:23.547 --> 16:24.766
I took everyone's tranquilizers

16:24.853 --> 16:25.985
and flushed them
down the toilet.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.508
What?

16:27.595 --> 16:28.900
I came here to help
because I owe someone something,

16:28.988 --> 16:30.424
a soldier like these men.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.991
I didn't come here
to stand by and do nothing

16:32.078 --> 16:33.993
while you crush their spirits
with chemicals.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.169
He deserved better,
and they deserve better.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.605
What the hell is
wrong with you?

16:37.692 --> 16:39.215
You can't take these
men off their sedatives.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.478
[loud clatter]

16:57.320 --> 16:58.800

-Come on, come on!

-You have to...
-[clang]

17:02.891 --> 17:03.892
Ow!

17:03.979 --> 17:05.415
Oh, I don't
want to hear it.

17:05.502 --> 17:06.895
Isn't it bad enough
with your mother gone

17:06.982 --> 17:08.243
and your brother
missing?

17:08.330 --> 17:09.897
You have to go out
brawling in the streets?

17:09.984 --> 17:11.160
[sighs]

17:11.247 --> 17:12.335
I'm sorry.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.858
Yeah.

17:14.945 --> 17:16.425
Wait a minute.

17:16.512 --> 17:18.472
This is our dinner.

17:19.646 --> 17:21.431
[sighs]

17:22.519 --> 17:24.434
Well, good news.

17:24.521 --> 17:25.914
God decided I don't deserve

17:26.001 --> 17:27.349
to redeem myself.

17:27.436 --> 17:28.917
I get to carry this
soul-crushing guilt

17:29.004 --> 17:30.962
for the rest of my life.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.488
Yeah. I've been trying
to compose a requiem for him.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.011
It's hard getting
in the right mood

17:36.098 --> 17:37.534
using a glitter marker.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.538
Maybe we've been trying
to honor Reese the wrong way.

17:41.625 --> 17:42.539
What do you mean?

17:42.626 --> 17:44.106
Reese wasn't into helping people

17:44.193 --> 17:45.107
and doing good deeds.

17:45.194 --> 17:46.369
He loved to smash stuff

17:46.456 --> 17:48.154
and destroy things
for no reason.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.720
If we're gonna honor Reese,

17:49.807 --> 17:51.592
maybe we should think
about doing it his way.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.289
You have something in mind?

17:53.376 --> 17:55.900
This kind of caught my eye.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.554
An art fair?

17:57.641 --> 17:59.861
Just think what Reese
would have done with this.

17:59.948 --> 18:04.170
They've got driftwood art,
yarn owls, dream catchers,

18:04.257 --> 18:06.302
face painting, folk dancing.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.870
They are kind of
begging for it.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.437
I don't know.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.352
There's rapping grannies.

18:12.439 --> 18:13.831
Let me see that.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.834
REESE:
Let me go, please!

18:16.921 --> 18:19.228
Come on. How was I supposed
to know it was your god?

18:19.315 --> 18:21.839
It looked like
a monkey man! Uhh!

18:21.926 --> 18:23.798
You're gonna regret this!

18:23.885 --> 18:24.973
If my husband finds out,

18:25.060 --> 18:26.366
he'll make you pay.

18:26.453 --> 18:29.238
Then you'll really be sorry.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.023
Mom?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.200
Thank you so much.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.549
-There you are.
-[coins clink]

18:36.550 --> 18:40.293
What in the name of God
were you thinking?!

18:40.380 --> 18:42.208
Look at you.
You are filthy!

18:42.295 --> 18:44.166
Your nails
are a disgrace.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.037
You've been tomb robbing!

18:46.125 --> 18:48.518
Well, the fun stops
now, young man!

18:48.605 --> 18:50.477
Oh, you are in
so much trouble!

18:50.564 --> 18:52.087
[crowd chattering]

19:04.404 --> 19:07.015
I just can't believe
he could really be gone.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.234
I know.

19:10.061 --> 19:13.978
Wow, this diaper's got
to be a five-pounder.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.938
I'd like to think
Jamie knew what it was for.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.157
[sighs]

19:18.244 --> 19:19.680
It's so weird.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.377
It seems like all my life

19:21.464 --> 19:22.639
I've wished
for something horrible

19:22.726 --> 19:24.032
to happen to Reese,

19:24.119 --> 19:27.122
and now that it has, I...

19:27.209 --> 19:28.732
I...

19:28.819 --> 19:30.778
-Miss him?
-Yeah.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.348
I do, too.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.480
Remember when he
shaved my eyebrows

19:37.567 --> 19:38.873
and glued them back on,

19:38.960 --> 19:40.875
so I looked
permanently surprised?

19:40.962 --> 19:43.094
That was genius.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.577
[beep, balloons popping]

19:47.664 --> 19:50.014
-[crowd groaning]
-MAN: This is horrible!

19:50.101 --> 19:52.930
Remember that look of pure joy
he'd get on Christmas morning

19:53.017 --> 19:54.323
when he was smashing
our presents?

19:54.410 --> 19:56.107
MAN: [whimpering]
Oh, it's in my eyes!

19:56.195 --> 19:58.675
No matter how hard I tried,

19:58.762 --> 20:00.373
I could never make Mom's face

20:00.460 --> 20:03.245
turn that special
purple color.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.681
Reese purple.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.684
Why couldn't I have said
something meaningful

20:07.771 --> 20:09.208
to him before he...

20:09.295 --> 20:10.339
[sighs]

20:10.426 --> 20:12.123
Don't do this to yourself.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.910
[popping, screaming]

20:15.997 --> 20:19.522
MAN: Oh, no! Oh, no!
I can't believe...

20:19.609 --> 20:21.002
He would have
liked this.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.438
[disgusted exclamations]

20:22.525 --> 20:24.048
I only wish he could have
been here to see it.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.224
REESE:
Me, too.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.705
Reese!

20:28.792 --> 20:30.838
-DEWEY: You're not dead!
-MALCOLM: I can't believe it.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.535
Reese, I'm so glad to see you.

20:32.622 --> 20:33.449
All right, all right.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.016
Don't 'mo me.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.278
How does this work?

20:36.365 --> 20:38.019
Oh, well,

20:38.106 --> 20:40.413
we have the remote here,
and you pick out a good one...

20:40.500 --> 20:42.241
Here. We were
saving this one.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.286
It's from when
Jamie had swine flu.

20:44.373 --> 20:45.635
Nice.
