WEBVTT

00:03.594 --> 00:05.007
Erin.

00:05.086 --> 00:07.421
Hi, I'm so glad I caught you.

00:07.702 --> 00:09.924
What are you doing here?
Why didn't you call?

00:10.003 --> 00:12.205
Well, because you've stopped
returning my calls.

00:12.239 --> 00:14.311
I... I can't do this.
I have to go to work.

00:14.336 --> 00:17.617
Honey, I have something
I want to give you.

00:18.412 --> 00:20.485
It was my mother's.

00:20.748 --> 00:23.282
And yes, the pearls are real.

00:28.422 --> 00:30.323
What... What is this?

00:30.357 --> 00:32.630
What angle are you working right now?

00:33.067 --> 00:37.200
Nothing, sweetheart, I just...
I just want you to have them.

00:42.069 --> 00:44.170
Mom, I'm... I'm late. I have to go.

00:44.204 --> 00:46.038
Okay, okay.

00:49.410 --> 00:50.643
Bye.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:01.455 --> 01:02.642
Yes, you took the job.

01:02.667 --> 01:03.967
Kev!

01:04.057 --> 01:05.724
- Temporary basis.
- All right,

01:05.758 --> 01:07.469
welcome to Intelligence.
You owe me 20 bucks.

01:07.493 --> 01:08.933
You had to take the job, didn't you?

01:10.174 --> 01:12.698
- What's in the box?
- Loukoumades.

01:12.732 --> 01:14.733
- Louko-what?
- Greek doughnuts.

01:14.767 --> 01:17.502
Shameless attempt to curry
favor on my first day.

01:17.537 --> 01:19.037
You're off to a good start.

01:19.072 --> 01:20.872
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

01:20.907 --> 01:23.008
- And then she gave me this.
- That's surprising.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.976
- I know.
- No, I mean, it's surprising

01:25.011 --> 01:27.122
that she hasn't hocked it yet.
Are you sure it's real?

01:27.146 --> 01:29.615
I don't know, but she didn't
ask for anything.

01:29.849 --> 01:31.184
Yeah, well, she will.

01:31.209 --> 01:33.417
Erin, people don't change, all right?
Especially Bunny.

01:33.453 --> 01:34.997
You gotta shut that door.
You gotta deadbolt it.

01:35.021 --> 01:36.488
Jay, I'm not looking for advice.

01:36.522 --> 01:37.989
I'm just trying to talk this out.

01:38.024 --> 01:39.691
I know you're not
gonna want to hear this,

01:39.726 --> 01:41.893
but I think you're getting played again.

01:41.928 --> 01:44.496
Jay, I don't need you to tell me

01:44.530 --> 01:46.431
- what to do with my mother.
- Okay.

01:46.466 --> 01:48.400
- Please?
- Okay.

01:50.770 --> 01:54.740
Lindsay, you're now partners with Upton.

01:54.774 --> 01:57.042
Halstead, you ride with Olinsky.

01:58.711 --> 02:00.912
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

02:02.548 --> 02:05.383
- Ruzek.
- So where do you want me?

02:05.418 --> 02:07.119
Right here. Jay, you're over there.

02:07.153 --> 02:09.588
Guys, guys, I'm getting
an emergency alert from CPIC.

02:09.622 --> 02:11.957
Yeah, I'm on. Feed it to me.

02:11.991 --> 02:14.793
All right.
OEMC received multiple 911 calls

02:14.827 --> 02:16.862
alerting them to this
private Facebook user group.

02:16.896 --> 02:19.965
Yeah, I got it. It's streaming live.

02:19.999 --> 02:21.800
<i>Yeah, we're watching it.</i>

02:21.834 --> 02:23.545
I'm gonna stay on the line
while you triangulate

02:23.569 --> 02:25.537
the signal.

02:25.571 --> 02:27.472
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

02:27.507 --> 02:29.775
<i>You got me confused with somebody else!</i>

02:29.809 --> 02:32.577
<i>I didn't do anything to you!</i>

02:33.613 --> 02:35.747
<i>No, please, no!</i>

02:35.782 --> 02:38.049
<i>No, please!</i>

02:39.786 --> 02:41.386
Ruz, tell them to work faster.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.088
<i>- No, no, no, no!
- Listen, we need</i>

02:43.122 --> 02:45.924
<i>- that address now, now!
- No, no, no, no!</i>

02:47.598 --> 02:50.831
Yeah, what is it? 3200 block of Larimer.

02:50.856 --> 02:52.063
Let's go, come on!

03:28.868 --> 03:30.424
All right, fan out, this just happened.

03:30.448 --> 03:32.962
He can't have gotten far.

03:33.139 --> 03:35.006
5021, George, advise responding,

03:35.041 --> 03:37.609
we got a bonafide homicide,
offender's in the wind,

03:37.643 --> 03:39.811
description unknown,
direction of travel unknown,

03:39.846 --> 03:42.848
<i>- roll the crime lab.
- Copy that, 5021 George.</i>

03:46.085 --> 03:48.253
Hank.

03:50.525 --> 03:51.992
Hey, man...

03:53.990 --> 03:55.924
That looks like blood.

04:08.991 --> 04:12.964
All right, our victim is male,
African American, mid-20s.

04:12.989 --> 04:15.166
We ran facial recognition, no matches.

04:15.191 --> 04:16.980
His fingerprints
were burnt off in the fire,

04:17.005 --> 04:20.341
and his wallet was torched, so,
in short, we can't ID this guy.

04:20.497 --> 04:24.400
What we do know is that our
victim's blood type does match

04:24.434 --> 04:27.303
the writing on the wall
in the warehouse.

04:27.337 --> 04:29.305
It's B positive.

04:29.339 --> 04:31.807
Someone thinks our victim
is a sex offender, or wants us

04:31.842 --> 04:33.242
to believe that he was.

04:33.276 --> 04:35.077
And the attack was well thought out.

04:35.112 --> 04:37.146
They live streamed the torture
on a burner phone

04:37.180 --> 04:38.389
that they dumped at the scene.

04:38.414 --> 04:40.850
The gloves, the gas can...
they're all standard-issue

04:40.875 --> 04:42.929
products available at every
hardware store in the city.

04:42.953 --> 04:44.620
Two metal objects survived the fire:

04:44.654 --> 04:47.323
This metal crucifix,
which matches the one

04:47.357 --> 04:50.993
- in the photo, and a key.
- Yep, and this key

04:51.027 --> 04:52.528
matches a Kia 2010 that was parked

04:52.562 --> 04:54.296
right in front of the warehouse.

04:54.331 --> 04:55.641
As we speak, the crime lab
is sweeping it

04:55.665 --> 04:57.333
for prints and DNA.

04:57.367 --> 04:59.268
The car's registered
to a Janice Hendricks.

04:59.302 --> 05:01.003
She has an address in Inglewood.

05:01.037 --> 05:02.505
Okay, why don't you go talk to her,

05:02.539 --> 05:04.874
you and Jay?
Let's comb the neighborhood.

05:04.908 --> 05:06.219
We gotta ID this victim if we're gonna

05:06.243 --> 05:08.110
figure out who targeted him.

05:08.145 --> 05:12.081
Hey, Sarge, um, are...
are we really doing this?

05:14.885 --> 05:17.119
Get a box if you need it.

05:22.025 --> 05:24.160
You know that thing
with Voight back there?

05:24.194 --> 05:26.038
- Yeah, what about it?
- That's something he should've

05:26.062 --> 05:28.330
done a long time ago.
I mean, there's a line, Jay.

05:28.365 --> 05:30.866
- And it's there for a reason.
- Wait, hold on,

05:30.901 --> 05:33.169
my relationship with Erin
never interfered with my job.

05:33.203 --> 05:36.505
Well, you're not a good judge, man.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.374
- You saying it did?
- Well, it's only

05:38.408 --> 05:40.386
a matter of time, man.
I mean, every cop in this city

05:40.410 --> 05:42.678
would kill for your job.

05:42.712 --> 05:45.981
Why jeopardize that?

05:46.016 --> 05:49.084
- Man, I blew it.
- Nah, you still got a job.

05:49.119 --> 05:53.122
- You still got a desk.
- No, I blew it with Erin.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.976
That looks like our victim.

06:16.112 --> 06:19.682
I'd loaned Elijah my car.
He was trying to find a job.

06:19.716 --> 06:21.417
Elijah was your nephew, correct?

06:21.451 --> 06:23.419
Yeah.

06:23.453 --> 06:27.556
He just moved here.

06:27.591 --> 06:29.558
He was trying to put his life together

06:29.593 --> 06:33.262
after all those years in jail
for something he didn't do.

06:33.296 --> 06:34.363
Do you mean the rape?

06:34.397 --> 06:36.098
It wasn't no rape.

06:36.132 --> 06:38.267
They were boyfriend and girlfriend.

06:38.301 --> 06:40.102
They were both kids.

06:40.136 --> 06:42.104
They put him in jail
for having relations.

06:42.138 --> 06:43.439
Because she was underage.

06:43.473 --> 06:45.541
Because she was white,

06:45.575 --> 06:51.547
and that don't fly
in Crown Point, Indiana.

06:51.581 --> 06:54.283
Elijah was a star.

06:54.317 --> 06:57.152
He had a football scholarship
to Purdue University.

06:57.187 --> 07:01.290
They ripped his whole future away.

07:01.324 --> 07:04.627
Who put up these flyers?

07:04.661 --> 07:09.565
When Elijah moved in, he had
to register as a sex offender.

07:09.599 --> 07:12.268
Neighborhood Watch got busy.

07:12.302 --> 07:14.603
Do you have any idea who
might have targeted your nephew?

07:14.638 --> 07:17.406
Well, I'd say the girlfriend
and her family.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.476
They're the kind of Christians
that just love to hate.

07:20.510 --> 07:25.114
They made Elijah out
like he was an animal.

07:25.148 --> 07:28.017
Truth is, he was just in love.

07:28.051 --> 07:29.652
The victim is Elijah Hendricks.

07:29.686 --> 07:31.620
He's 25. He did 7 years

07:31.655 --> 07:33.656
for statutory rape at Indiana State Pen.

07:33.690 --> 07:35.991
He got out about a month ago,
and he registered

07:36.026 --> 07:37.470
as a sex offender at his aunt's address.

07:37.494 --> 07:39.028
Elijah was 18 when he was accused

07:39.062 --> 07:40.696
of raping a 16-year-old girl.

07:40.730 --> 07:43.132
The victim's name was sealed
under a plea bargain.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.801
- The aunt gave us
the woman's name: Beth Murphy.

07:45.835 --> 07:47.670
No DMV records.
The only photo we could find

07:47.704 --> 07:49.015
was from her high school yearbook

07:49.039 --> 07:50.639
from Crown Point, Indiana.

07:50.674 --> 07:52.441
We got the phone records
from Elijah's cell.

07:52.475 --> 07:55.511
On the day he was killed,
he got three phone calls

07:55.545 --> 07:58.047
from Beth Murphy.
We've been trying to reach her,

07:58.081 --> 07:59.615
but it keeps going to voicemail.

07:59.649 --> 08:02.793
- Did you get an address?
- No, just a PO box in Crown Point.

08:02.818 --> 08:05.054
All right, you and Upton,
head to Indiana.

08:05.088 --> 08:06.222
- All right.
- Hey, but loop in

08:06.246 --> 08:08.357
the local police.
We got no jurisdiction there.

08:08.391 --> 08:09.591
Right.

08:10.694 --> 08:12.795
I'll tell you what,
you guys got way nicer cars

08:12.829 --> 08:14.663
in Intelligence.

08:14.698 --> 08:17.132
I know, we just seized
this one from a cartel boss.

08:17.167 --> 08:19.435
Sweet.

08:22.572 --> 08:25.240
So you and Halstead,
you guys were partners

08:25.275 --> 08:28.377
- for a while?
- Yeah.

08:28.411 --> 08:32.313
I didn't mean to throw sand
in the gears.

08:32.349 --> 08:36.552
No, don't worry about it.

08:36.586 --> 08:39.288
It was probably time
for a change anyway.

08:43.793 --> 08:45.761
They said two cops
were coming from Chicago.

08:45.795 --> 08:48.831
- It's not what I was picturing.
- Well, thank you for your help.

08:48.865 --> 08:52.601
Are these the case files
on Elijah Hendricks?

08:56.606 --> 08:58.374
Yeah, you should've seen this kid play.

08:58.408 --> 09:02.411
He was one hell of a tailback.

09:02.445 --> 09:05.547
Tough background and whatnot.
Seemed to overcome it.

09:05.582 --> 09:07.516
Real shame how it went sideways on him.

09:07.550 --> 09:09.418
His aunt said he was railroaded.

09:09.452 --> 09:12.755
Folks loved Elijah
when he was scoring touchdowns,

09:12.789 --> 09:16.091
but they turned on him when they
thought he crossed the line.

09:16.126 --> 09:18.594
You mean when he slept with
his white girlfriend?

09:18.628 --> 09:21.897
Parents found out what was
going on, and they lost it.

09:21.931 --> 09:26.602
Beth testified against Elijah.

09:26.636 --> 09:28.570
For my money he never
should've been arrested,

09:28.605 --> 09:30.439
much less put away.

09:30.473 --> 09:33.308
Well, it says here you were
the arresting officer.

09:33.343 --> 09:35.377
I don't make the laws, Detective.

09:35.412 --> 09:36.812
I enforce them.

09:36.846 --> 09:38.747
I'm sure you can appreciate that.

09:38.782 --> 09:41.483
Indeed.

09:41.518 --> 09:43.452
Does Beth Murphy still live around here?

09:43.486 --> 09:45.154
I can take you there.

09:45.188 --> 09:48.891
That's all right.
We just need an address.

10:03.640 --> 10:07.142
Are you Beth Murphy?

10:07.177 --> 10:09.411
We need to ask you a couple questions.

10:09.446 --> 10:11.146
What's it about?

10:11.181 --> 10:13.515
Elijah Hendricks.

10:13.550 --> 10:15.918
Judge told me, if I testified,
it'd be over.

10:15.952 --> 10:18.687
Nobody'd come and bother me.

10:18.721 --> 10:22.324
Elijah was just murdered.

10:22.358 --> 10:23.959
No.

10:23.993 --> 10:25.494
And, according to his phone records,

10:25.528 --> 10:27.830
the last person he talked to was you.

10:27.864 --> 10:30.599
Why'd you call Elijah?

10:30.633 --> 10:32.634
To warn him.

10:32.669 --> 10:35.938
About what?

10:35.972 --> 10:38.696
My boyfriend went into my Facebook.

10:39.642 --> 10:41.643
Saw that Elijah had sent me a message.

10:41.678 --> 10:43.899
He told me he was out of jail.

10:44.571 --> 10:47.616
To be honest with you,
I still had feelings for Elijah,

10:47.650 --> 10:51.320
and Jake figured that out.

10:51.354 --> 10:53.856
Is Jake the one
that gave you the black eye?

10:57.026 --> 10:59.528
Where can we find him?

11:00.897 --> 11:02.898
Whoa, whoa, I know you're
in a tough situation.

11:02.932 --> 11:06.502
You feel trapped. I get it, but do

11:06.536 --> 11:08.403
the right thing here,
and I swear we will do

11:08.438 --> 11:10.606
whatever we can to help you.

11:15.378 --> 11:18.547
- He's at the bar.
- Okay.

11:18.581 --> 11:20.449
Thank you.

11:26.256 --> 11:29.892
- Hey, is Jake Harper here?
- Pool table.

11:38.434 --> 11:40.903
We need to ask you
a couple of questions.

11:40.937 --> 11:43.338
Let me guess... my girlfriend sent you?

11:43.373 --> 11:45.941
No, she didn't really want
another black eye.

11:45.975 --> 11:48.877
Takes a real man, Jake?

11:48.912 --> 11:51.046
Maybe you like it rough too?

11:51.080 --> 11:54.016
Trust me, Jake, today is
not the day you wanna

11:54.050 --> 11:57.853
start trash-talking my partner.

11:57.887 --> 12:01.723
Let's step outside.

12:01.758 --> 12:02.758
Give me that.

12:07.597 --> 12:11.066
Elijah Hendricks, you recognize him?

12:11.100 --> 12:12.935
No friend of mine.

12:12.969 --> 12:16.538
He was murdered yesterday.

12:16.573 --> 12:20.375
What? I'm supposed to shed a tear?

12:20.410 --> 12:21.954
Well, are you aware that,
in high school,

12:21.978 --> 12:23.946
Elijah was convicted
of raping your girlfriend?

12:23.980 --> 12:25.647
I guess he got what he deserved.

12:25.682 --> 12:28.684
Did he? To be burned alive?

12:31.821 --> 12:33.088
That wasn't me.

12:33.122 --> 12:34.623
No? 'Cause I've seen Beth.

12:34.657 --> 12:36.758
You're clearly the jealous type.

12:36.793 --> 12:38.327
How would you feel?

12:38.361 --> 12:40.596
Man rapes a woman,
gets set free, and then

12:40.630 --> 12:42.297
he contacts her?

12:42.332 --> 12:44.299
"Hey, baby, you remember
the good old days?"

12:44.334 --> 12:46.478
So you knock your girlfriend
around and then go after Elijah?

12:46.502 --> 12:49.671
It wasn't like that.
I didn't know it was

12:49.706 --> 12:53.108
gonna go down like this. I swear.

12:53.142 --> 12:54.486
I found this group on the Internet.

12:54.510 --> 12:56.912
I told them about Elijah.

12:56.946 --> 13:03.819
They're the ones who made the video.

13:03.853 --> 13:07.823
Whoa, hey, we might wanna
check this out.

13:07.857 --> 13:12.027
This video dropped on YouTube
two days ago.

13:12.061 --> 13:16.665
<i>Elijah Hendricks, we heard
you just moved to Chicago.</i>

13:16.699 --> 13:18.934
<i>- Who are you?
- We also heard</i>

13:18.968 --> 13:21.670
<i>you're a pedophile.
You rape little girls.</i>

13:21.704 --> 13:24.339
<i>- Get away from me.
- We don't want child molesters</i>

13:24.374 --> 13:26.483
<i>in our city. The sick bastard.</i>

13:26.508 --> 13:30.483
<i>Elijah Hendricks has now been
outed by the Perv Hunters.</i>

13:31.014 --> 13:34.750
"The Perv Hunters"? Who the hell
are the Perv Hunters?

13:39.208 --> 13:42.969
Perv Hunters first hit the radar
three years ago in Toronto.

13:43.001 --> 13:44.664
They're a loose collection

13:44.689 --> 13:47.260
of vigilantes who are
dedicated to the public shaming

13:47.285 --> 13:49.901
of pedophiles.
Their MO is to ID sex offenders

13:49.926 --> 13:51.793
and then post videos of them online.

13:51.828 --> 13:53.339
The tech guys are trying to
figure out who posted

13:53.363 --> 13:55.197
the YouTube video. No luck yet.

13:55.231 --> 13:57.176
So Toronto PD told us
the Perv Hunters, they've become

13:57.200 --> 13:58.607
a real pain in the ass.

13:58.632 --> 14:00.334
Technically, they don't break any laws,

14:00.350 --> 14:01.727
but they've jacked up
a few investigations.

14:01.751 --> 14:03.719
Okay, so who's the boss?

14:03.753 --> 14:05.731
They don't have one.
They're more like a franchise.

14:05.755 --> 14:08.230
Perv Hunters have dropped
ambush videos in Winnipeg,

14:08.255 --> 14:09.941
Montreal, Vancouver.

14:09.966 --> 14:12.474
The first one hit the States
in Chicago last month.

14:12.507 --> 14:13.853
Yeah, but burning people alive?

14:13.878 --> 14:15.876
That's not their MO.
They do public shaming videos,

14:15.900 --> 14:18.017
- not executions.
- Maybe in Canada.

14:18.802 --> 14:20.235
This is Chicago.

14:20.270 --> 14:22.705
Okay, hey, hey, I got something.

14:22.739 --> 14:26.275
This video just dropped
an hour ago on YouTube.

14:26.309 --> 14:28.243
The cameraman sounds just like
the cat that was

14:28.278 --> 14:30.104
in the Elijah video.

14:31.029 --> 14:32.697
<i>Alan Metcalf.</i>

14:32.722 --> 14:33.979
<i>- What do you want?
- We want you to</i>

14:34.003 --> 14:36.552
<i>- stop raping little boys.
- Just leave me alone.</i>

14:36.586 --> 14:39.488
<i>- Leave our kids alone!
- Get away from me!</i>

14:41.725 --> 14:43.926
<i>The sick bastard Alan Metcalf
has now been outed</i>

14:43.960 --> 14:45.761
<i>by the Perv Hunters.</i>

14:45.795 --> 14:47.373
<i>If you see him anywhere
near your children,</i>

14:47.397 --> 14:48.897
<i>you know what to do.</i>

14:48.932 --> 14:50.733
That's Alan Metcalf. He's on the Chicago.

14:50.767 --> 14:53.569
Sex Offender Registry.
He lives at 505 Larimer.

14:53.603 --> 14:56.271
All right, Al, you and
Halstead go talk to Metcalf.

14:56.306 --> 14:59.842
Find every Perv Hunter
operating in Chicago.

15:12.689 --> 15:16.058
Hey, Mom, I need to talk to you.

15:19.429 --> 15:21.463
Alan Metcalf?

15:23.967 --> 15:26.435
Get the hell away from my house.

15:26.469 --> 15:29.638
Chicago PD.

15:29.672 --> 15:31.306
I'll take that.

15:31.341 --> 15:32.785
These days, a stranger
shows up at my door,

15:32.809 --> 15:34.476
I grab a bat.

15:34.511 --> 15:36.645
Is that because of
the Perv Hunters?

15:36.679 --> 15:37.980
Yeah? Can you describe the men

15:38.014 --> 15:39.081
who ambushed you?

15:39.115 --> 15:40.816
There was just one guy.

15:40.850 --> 15:43.519
20s, shaved head, tattoos,
like he was late

15:43.553 --> 15:46.855
for an Anthrax concert
and mad as hell about it.

15:46.890 --> 15:48.857
There's some evil people in this world.

15:48.892 --> 15:51.126
Says the guy who molested
a 10 year old boy.

15:51.161 --> 15:53.929
And I did 12 years for it.
I paid my debt to society.

15:53.963 --> 15:55.674
You know what?
That's cold comfort for the kid.

15:55.698 --> 15:57.009
It's not like he can turn the page.

15:57.033 --> 15:59.501
Jay...

15:59.536 --> 16:02.971
Look, I'm a pedophile, okay?

16:03.006 --> 16:05.541
It's not something I chose.
I was just born this way.

16:05.575 --> 16:07.976
But I go to therapy, I take my meds,

16:08.011 --> 16:09.511
and I've learned to manage my urges.

16:09.546 --> 16:11.814
I got a right to live in peace.

16:11.848 --> 16:13.816
Okay, so, did you see
the car he was driving?

16:13.850 --> 16:14.860
Gray Mustang. I got a picture

16:14.884 --> 16:16.785
of his license plate.

16:16.820 --> 16:18.798
All right, we're gonna have
a patrol car sit on your house

16:18.822 --> 16:20.789
as a precaution.

16:20.824 --> 16:25.861
Listen, I got enough problems
with my neighbors already.

16:25.895 --> 16:27.830
They'll flip out if they see
a cop car parked

16:27.864 --> 16:29.731
in front of my house.

16:29.766 --> 16:31.767
Please.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.547
You guys lost?

16:45.582 --> 16:49.017
- You Craig Gorman?
- Yeah.

16:49.052 --> 16:51.720
- What's this about?
- It's about your latest.

16:51.754 --> 16:53.589
Perv Hunters video.

16:53.623 --> 16:56.692
Familiar with the First Amendment?

16:56.726 --> 16:58.594
Yeah.

16:58.628 --> 17:01.730
Is that the 14? 14 words?

17:01.764 --> 17:04.900
What would you know about it?

17:04.934 --> 17:08.837
"We must secure
the existence of our people

17:08.872 --> 17:11.540
and a future for white children."

17:11.574 --> 17:12.674
Fourteen.

17:12.709 --> 17:14.843
Hey, he can count.

17:20.950 --> 17:23.085
No, you're... you're doing great.
Say it again.

17:23.118 --> 17:24.953
- Say it again.
- It's called free speech!

17:24.988 --> 17:26.799
Hey, you know what?
One more word of free speech,

17:26.823 --> 17:28.534
I'll kick your teeth
in the back of your throat.

17:28.558 --> 17:31.527
Move, get out of here. Keep moving.

17:33.830 --> 17:37.065
Black people, sex offenders.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.867
I gotta hand one thing to you, Craig.

17:38.902 --> 17:41.603
You are an equal opportunity hater.

17:41.638 --> 17:46.208
I've got a constitutional
right to express my opinion.

17:46.242 --> 17:48.544
You know, I don't get it.

17:48.578 --> 17:52.047
What made you a Perv Hunter, Craig?

17:52.081 --> 17:54.449
Did you get molested by a pedophile?

17:54.484 --> 17:56.585
Hell no. I got a buddy in Toronto.

17:56.619 --> 17:58.787
He told me about Perv Hunters.

17:58.821 --> 18:00.956
Once I realized how many
of these sick bastards

18:00.990 --> 18:03.492
were out walking
our streets... that's something

18:03.526 --> 18:04.960
I couldn't abide.

18:04.994 --> 18:06.795
Yeah, you took matters
into your own hands.

18:06.829 --> 18:09.097
I'm doing your job for you.
You oughta give me a medal.

18:09.132 --> 18:10.276
Let me tell you something, son.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.468
They don't give medals for this.

18:13.494 --> 18:16.257
In Canada, it's catch and release,

18:17.001 --> 18:19.436
but you like to take it
all the way, don't you?

18:22.779 --> 18:25.013
You torched the guy.

18:25.048 --> 18:27.182
Whoa, I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:27.217 --> 18:30.919
That's a black pedophile,
something you can't abide.

18:30.954 --> 18:32.854
I swear, we just ambushed the guy.

18:32.889 --> 18:37.192
Who's "we"?

18:37.227 --> 18:39.661
We keep the names of our members secret.

18:39.696 --> 18:42.798
We got followers from all over the city.
We're an army.

18:42.832 --> 18:46.001
Yeah, the thing about that,
Craig, is that

18:46.035 --> 18:49.204
all the IP addresses associated
with Perv Hunters in Chicago,

18:49.239 --> 18:51.306
they all trace back to the same place.

18:51.341 --> 18:54.943
That's your tattoo parlor,
which happens to be your house,

18:54.978 --> 18:57.212
which makes you an army of one.

18:59.015 --> 19:01.817
Sarge, you're gonna wanna see this, now.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.921
You hold onto these.

19:10.226 --> 19:13.996
Sarge, it's the same Facebook
feed that CPIC showed us.

19:14.030 --> 19:15.697
That's Alan Metcalf.

19:15.732 --> 19:19.167
<i>Please, please, no, no, no, no!</i>

19:19.202 --> 19:23.805
<i>No!</i>

19:23.840 --> 19:27.075
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

19:30.079 --> 19:32.451
They're all watching this.

19:39.359 --> 19:42.484
- What's going on?
- Don't talk, listen.

19:43.215 --> 19:47.008
The guy you targeted? Metcalf?

19:47.567 --> 19:49.730
He was just murdered.

19:52.305 --> 19:53.905
But I was here.

19:54.097 --> 19:56.543
You know it couldn't have been me.

19:56.809 --> 19:59.049
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

19:59.377 --> 20:01.312
Even if you didn't do it personally,

20:01.347 --> 20:03.949
you incited somebody to violence.

20:03.983 --> 20:06.451
And, because you admitted
to posting that video

20:06.485 --> 20:10.822
that IDed him, I can charge you
as an accessory to murder.

20:10.856 --> 20:12.857
Not if I take the Fifth.

20:12.892 --> 20:16.294
Craig, look at me.

20:18.431 --> 20:22.801
You're staring down the barrel
at three to five at Stateville,

20:22.835 --> 20:28.573
or I can knock the charges down,
and all you gotta do

20:28.608 --> 20:30.875
is put your little Perv Hunter
skills back to work

20:30.910 --> 20:34.879
one last time.
Only now, you work for me.

20:40.553 --> 20:43.421
<i>Hey, you, sick bastard.</i>

20:43.456 --> 20:45.724
<i>Like diddling little boys, do you?</i>

20:45.758 --> 20:47.759
<i>Get out. Get... Get away from me.</i>

20:47.793 --> 20:50.929
<i>- Sicko.
- Get... Get away from me!</i>

20:50.963 --> 20:53.365
<i>You perv! Yeah, keep walking.</i>

20:53.399 --> 20:57.002
<i>- We know exactly where you live.
- Back off!</i>

20:57.036 --> 20:58.770
Ambush video's uploading now.

20:58.804 --> 21:01.339
It'll be live on YouTube
in less than 60 seconds.

21:01.374 --> 21:04.042
Okay. For the profile name,

21:04.076 --> 21:08.513
let's put Alvin Obolensky.

21:14.754 --> 21:18.923
It's 14 letters.
You should appreciate that.

21:18.958 --> 21:23.895
7-1-61.

21:23.929 --> 21:26.698
You'll tell your boss
I'm fully cooperating, right?

21:29.435 --> 21:32.837
Yeah, regular Geek Squad.

21:38.944 --> 21:40.412
- Hi.
- I need to know

21:40.446 --> 21:44.549
what's going on here.

21:44.583 --> 21:47.619
Why did you give me this?

21:47.653 --> 21:49.487
Sweetheart, why do you always think...?

21:49.522 --> 21:51.823
Just answer me.

21:51.857 --> 21:56.961
Okay, I wasn't gonna tell you
this at first because, you know,

21:56.996 --> 21:58.674
it always sounds like
the same old, same old

21:58.698 --> 22:00.832
coming from me, but I've met

22:00.866 --> 22:02.133
this really great guy...

22:02.168 --> 22:04.602
Are you trying to get my attention?

22:04.637 --> 22:08.406
Is that what this is?

22:08.441 --> 22:11.409
Erin, we might be leaving Chicago.

22:13.879 --> 22:18.483
Because you wanna leave
or because you have to?

22:18.517 --> 22:23.154
If I have to leave,
then I'm saying good-bye now.

22:34.633 --> 22:37.502
So how long am I in the penalty box for?

22:37.536 --> 22:40.638
A week, a month, what?

22:40.673 --> 22:42.540
Jay, if you wanna stay in this unit,

22:42.575 --> 22:44.809
don't ask me that again.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.054
Hey, hey, hey, Al.

22:56.088 --> 22:58.690
Do not nod off on this bid on me.

23:02.762 --> 23:05.964
Is there anything I can
take off your plate at all?

23:05.998 --> 23:08.166
Up to, and including,
telling Sarge I need to

23:08.200 --> 23:11.903
rotate out or whatever you need.

23:11.937 --> 23:13.905
Thank you.

23:13.939 --> 23:17.642
I really appreciate that.

23:17.676 --> 23:20.812
Um...

23:20.846 --> 23:23.815
I just have a lot going on right now.

23:38.230 --> 23:39.864
Everybody, heads-up.

23:39.899 --> 23:43.968
Got a westbound vehicle
heading your way.

24:07.660 --> 24:11.796
All right, nobody does
anything till I give the order.

24:11.831 --> 24:15.066
<i>Waiting to see if this guy
commits an act of furtherance.</i>

24:21.674 --> 24:24.576
Got a bogie.

24:24.610 --> 24:26.678
<i>Just hold your positions.</i>

24:33.285 --> 24:35.653
- Come... come on.
- Whoa, whoa, hey.

24:35.688 --> 24:37.232
- Come on. Sorry. Come on.
- It's okay, it's okay.

24:37.256 --> 24:39.891
All right, grab him up.

24:45.631 --> 24:47.799
Chicago PD, drop the bag. Drop the bag.

24:50.135 --> 24:51.636
Ma'am, get that dog out of here.

24:51.670 --> 24:52.637
Get that dog out of here.

24:52.671 --> 24:53.838
Don't move.

24:56.876 --> 24:58.576
Let's go.

25:43.722 --> 25:45.723
Jeremy Pettigrew.

25:45.758 --> 25:47.225
That's your real name?

25:47.259 --> 25:48.893
Yes, it is. Do you mind telling me

25:48.928 --> 25:50.328
what this is all about, Officer?

25:52.264 --> 25:54.666
Sergeant, I'm a Sergeant.

25:54.700 --> 25:58.369
How about you tell me what you
were doing at that house?

25:58.404 --> 26:01.639
I was just leaving my business card.

26:01.674 --> 26:04.075
I get foreclosure notices from the city.

26:04.109 --> 26:06.344
I was just hoping for some work.

26:06.378 --> 26:08.680
Okay, and you get these notifications

26:08.714 --> 26:10.148
from where, exactly?

26:10.182 --> 26:11.593
No, I just check for foreclosed homes

26:11.617 --> 26:13.918
on the Internet.

26:13.953 --> 26:16.387
They're cash cows. All of them

26:16.422 --> 26:19.157
- are fixer-uppers, so.
- And then you go door to door

26:19.191 --> 26:21.326
at 1:30 a.m.?

26:21.360 --> 26:23.595
I was working very late on another job,

26:23.629 --> 26:25.340
and I was just on my way home.
It was empty.

26:25.364 --> 26:29.334
- It's not like I was disturbing...
- Jeremy.

26:29.368 --> 26:34.038
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:34.073 --> 26:36.341
Explain the stun gun
and the plastic cuffs

26:36.375 --> 26:39.877
we found in your tool bag.

26:39.912 --> 26:44.382
I go inside of strangers'
houses for a living, Sergeant.

26:44.416 --> 26:47.018
And if you've ever been chased
by a South Side pit bull,

26:47.052 --> 26:52.390
you'll understand what the taser's for.

26:52.424 --> 26:54.058
And those aren't plastic cuffs.

26:54.093 --> 26:57.195
Those are cable ties for pipe repair.

27:05.671 --> 27:07.872
We ran Pettigrew
for any criminal history.

27:07.906 --> 27:10.908
No record, never been arrested,
but his name was run through.

27:10.943 --> 27:12.977
LEADS by an officer
and a detective in Detroit

27:13.012 --> 27:14.812
three years ago.

27:14.847 --> 27:16.648
Here's a printout of the inquiries.

27:16.682 --> 27:18.460
We got the officers' names
and gave them a call.

27:18.484 --> 27:20.718
The lead detective told us
that Pettigrew was

27:20.753 --> 27:22.887
the person of interest
in a kidnapping and murder

27:22.921 --> 27:26.057
of a tender age victim
that was sexually assaulted.

27:26.091 --> 27:28.003
They brought Pettigrew in,
but could never arrest him.

27:28.027 --> 27:29.927
They didn't have enough
physical evidence.

27:29.962 --> 27:32.664
You're thinking this guy is a pedophile?

27:32.698 --> 27:34.342
Detective in Detroit
thought he was good for it.

27:34.366 --> 27:36.011
Said it's one of those cases
that'll haunt you

27:36.035 --> 27:37.835
your whole career.

27:37.870 --> 27:39.904
All right, we need
a psych profile on Pettigrew.

27:39.938 --> 27:41.472
I know someone.

27:49.114 --> 27:51.082
Hey, thank you for coming,
Dr. Richardson.

27:51.116 --> 27:53.017
I've told you, Erin.
If you ever need something,

27:53.052 --> 27:54.252
I'm here.

27:54.286 --> 27:56.542
So what's going on?

27:56.889 --> 27:59.924
You said to me
in a session that avoidance

27:59.958 --> 28:01.926
is not a good strategy.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.862
- I stand by my advice.
- Right.

28:04.897 --> 28:09.348
I, um, I'm having
a hard time with this one.

28:11.070 --> 28:14.505
When I was seven, I was friends
with a girl who lived

28:14.901 --> 28:16.317
down the block from me
in my neighborhood.

28:16.341 --> 28:18.120
Her name was Ashley.

28:18.377 --> 28:22.000
And one day, she vanished.

28:23.048 --> 28:24.906
I mean, just disappeared, gone.

28:27.186 --> 28:30.455
And the not knowing what happened to her

28:30.596 --> 28:34.760
is what always gnawed at me
and what gnaws at her family.

28:37.262 --> 28:41.831
If this man is what I think
he is with kids,

28:42.401 --> 28:44.666
this feels very personal.

28:49.664 --> 28:52.273
Why don't you tell us about Detroit?

28:57.571 --> 28:59.896
That was a false accusation.

29:01.241 --> 29:03.842
That's not what the Detroit
Police Department has to say.

29:03.877 --> 29:05.332
I was never charged.

29:05.357 --> 29:07.643
That doesn't mean you didn't do it.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.983
That just means
they couldn't convict you.

29:11.017 --> 29:13.285
You were the person of interest.

29:17.023 --> 29:19.358
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

29:19.648 --> 29:21.281
No?

29:22.228 --> 29:26.146
What happened in Detroit...
It broke my heart.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.607
What did happen in Detroit, Jeremy?

29:38.445 --> 29:41.436
I was coaching a youth hockey team,

29:41.928 --> 29:44.571
and there was this boy, Joshua,

29:46.157 --> 29:48.493
who had a lot of raw talent,

29:49.189 --> 29:51.266
but he was in foster care.

29:51.532 --> 29:53.259
It was a terrible situation.

29:54.194 --> 29:56.346
And so I took him under my wing.

29:57.397 --> 30:00.073
His death was a total shock to me.

30:00.634 --> 30:02.401
It was awful.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.008
I miss him to this day.

30:15.281 --> 30:18.183
It says in here
that you were in foster care.

30:20.980 --> 30:22.947
Yes, I was.

30:27.127 --> 30:29.698
Did someone hurt you there, Jeremy?

30:30.397 --> 30:32.355
I learned to take care of myself.

30:33.633 --> 30:35.668
What happened to your wrists?

30:40.674 --> 30:43.075
It was an accident.

30:43.768 --> 30:45.101
On both wrists?

30:45.126 --> 30:46.771
I said it was an accident.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.084
You're a shrink, right?

30:52.118 --> 30:54.190
I'm a psychiatrist, yes.

30:54.688 --> 30:58.624
What you do, Doctor,
I don't believe in it.

31:01.294 --> 31:04.103
People should manage their own urges.

31:04.764 --> 31:06.705
And what if they can't?

31:07.367 --> 31:09.103
They should be punished.

31:16.276 --> 31:17.576
So what's your take, Doc?

31:17.610 --> 31:19.174
Is he a vigilante or a pedophile?

31:19.646 --> 31:21.447
- He's both.
- Both?

31:21.697 --> 31:24.416
The rigid moral code,
the suicide attempt,

31:24.533 --> 31:27.286
the fact the he completed evaded
the whole issue about whether

31:27.320 --> 31:30.289
he was abused as a child...
It's all consistent

31:30.323 --> 31:34.359
with the pathology
of a self-loathing pedophile.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.628
He feels a horrible guilt.

31:36.663 --> 31:40.265
But he can't kill himself,
so instead he turns his shame

31:40.300 --> 31:43.469
and his self-loathing
against people who are like him.

31:43.503 --> 31:46.371
So you're saying Pettigrew
is killing pedophiles.

31:46.406 --> 31:48.040
I think it's likely.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.476
And my fear is that he's
in this frenzied state

31:50.510 --> 31:54.179
because he recently kidnapped
and molested a child.

31:55.515 --> 31:57.783
Which means he's got a kid out there.

32:11.765 --> 32:13.132
Chicago PD!

32:16.402 --> 32:19.138
Anybody here? Call out!

32:20.540 --> 32:22.541
Clear.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.477
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

32:25.512 --> 32:30.382
- Call out.
- Clear.

32:51.604 --> 32:53.405
Guys...

33:09.823 --> 33:13.859
We found these in your bedroom.

33:18.298 --> 33:20.532
Where is the child?

33:22.669 --> 33:24.469
What child?

33:24.504 --> 33:27.573
Where is the child?

33:27.607 --> 33:29.408
What child?

33:29.442 --> 33:31.310
I... I... I... I...!

33:31.344 --> 33:34.413
I know what you think.
It's just... It's a fetish thing.

33:34.447 --> 33:35.881
I'm not...!

33:35.915 --> 33:38.483
- I'm not proud of it.
- You're lying.

33:38.518 --> 33:40.619
I swear to God,
I know what it looks like.

33:40.653 --> 33:43.255
- I promise.
- This is not Detroit.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.424
You will not get away with this here.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.459
I'm... I didn't...

33:50.196 --> 33:51.674
All right, we're now
looking at a kidnapping

33:51.698 --> 33:53.599
by a sexual predator.

33:53.633 --> 33:55.744
Our working theory is this guy
is murdering pedophiles

33:55.768 --> 33:57.569
to cleanse his own sins.

33:57.604 --> 33:59.471
All right, I reached out
to the ME in Detroit.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.851
Now, the juvenile that Pettigrew
was suspected of killing...

34:01.875 --> 34:04.309
He was assaulted over the course
of a week before he died.

34:04.344 --> 34:06.778
Which means that
there's a chance that our kid,

34:06.813 --> 34:08.813
whoever he is, may still be alive.

34:08.848 --> 34:10.815
So these tacks, they represent

34:10.850 --> 34:13.619
every missing juvenile
over the past two months.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.621
We're looking for a nexus
between Pettigrew

34:15.655 --> 34:17.322
and any one of these children.

34:17.357 --> 34:19.257
So Kev and I have found
Pettigrew's receipt book

34:19.292 --> 34:21.326
in his truck. We got the job addresses

34:21.360 --> 34:23.462
and cross-referenced them
to see which of his clients

34:23.496 --> 34:25.630
have young children.
As of now, there's 17.

34:25.665 --> 34:27.799
Yeah, we got patrolmen
pounding on doors right now.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.335
Soon as they dig something up,
they're gonna let us know.

34:30.370 --> 34:31.947
Tech lab pulled the
serial numbers off the phone

34:31.971 --> 34:33.871
we recovered at the Metcalf murder.

34:33.907 --> 34:36.808
They said it was a typical
pay-as-you-go throwaway model.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.301
The phone was badly burned,
but they were able to track it.

34:39.326 --> 34:41.051
It was sold out of a store
in Canaryville,

34:41.076 --> 34:42.791
and it got activated the day
Metcalf was murdered.

34:42.815 --> 34:45.284
Good, run it down.

34:45.318 --> 34:47.118
Were you working on Thursday?

34:47.143 --> 34:51.360
All day, worked a double
because Cheryl called in sick.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.292
Do you remember selling a phone

34:53.317 --> 34:55.554
to any of these guys, by chance?

34:56.862 --> 34:59.392
Yeah, I remember this dude here.

34:59.417 --> 35:02.834
He paid cash, which nobody
does anymore, and he asked

35:02.869 --> 35:04.870
a lot of questions about the phone's

35:04.904 --> 35:07.913
camera quality, yadda-yadda.

35:08.207 --> 35:09.834
Something about him gave me the willies.

35:09.859 --> 35:11.429
Did he have anybody with him?

35:12.011 --> 35:13.412
No.

35:13.446 --> 35:15.213
Well, not inside the store, anyway.

35:15.248 --> 35:17.683
He left his kid in the truck out front.

35:17.717 --> 35:20.552
He was asleep.

35:20.586 --> 35:21.987
Thank you.

35:23.177 --> 35:25.833
We pulled the exterior cameras
from the business next door.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.487
Tech lab was able to enhance the image.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.328
Any luck IDing the kid?

35:29.362 --> 35:31.596
No, it's too grainy
for facial recognition.

35:31.631 --> 35:33.699
Missing Persons is working
a tender age case.

35:33.733 --> 35:35.701
Derek Robbins, he's 10 years old.

35:35.735 --> 35:37.903
He disappeared five days ago
on his way to school.

35:37.937 --> 35:40.906
Last seen at his home at 4401 Burke.

35:40.940 --> 35:43.709
He was wearing a light blue jacket.

35:43.743 --> 35:46.211
Cross reference Robbins' address with.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.438
Pettigrew's work orders.

35:51.451 --> 35:53.508
Let's see if we can find 4400.

35:54.253 --> 35:57.522
Negative, it's not on here.

35:57.557 --> 36:00.258
Hey, 4300 block South Lowe.

36:00.293 --> 36:02.394
That's a block away from Robbins' place.

36:02.428 --> 36:03.695
You and me.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.868
Did you find Derek?

36:09.902 --> 36:11.770
- Are you Mrs. Robbins?
- Did you find my son?

36:11.804 --> 36:14.039
Not yet, ma'am.
But we have a few questions.

36:14.073 --> 36:16.308
I already told the other
detectives everything I know.

36:16.342 --> 36:17.653
Don't you people talk to each other?

36:17.677 --> 36:19.778
Do you recognize this man?

36:19.921 --> 36:21.619
I'm not sure, why? Who is he?

36:22.197 --> 36:23.963
Can you take another look, please?

36:26.652 --> 36:28.243
My God, I saw him.

36:28.728 --> 36:32.056
He was in the neighborhood last week.
He was... He was looking for work.

36:41.375 --> 36:44.521
The mom IDed Pettigrew.
He's got Derek Robbins.

36:44.617 --> 36:46.118
Bastard.

36:46.379 --> 36:47.680
Should we wait for Voight?

36:47.714 --> 36:50.467
There's a kid out there.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.151
Whoa, whoa, Erin, your gun.

36:52.185 --> 36:54.154
Erin!

36:56.189 --> 36:58.357
Come on.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.226
What's going on, Detective?

37:01.261 --> 37:02.861
Where is he, you sick son of a bitch?

37:02.896 --> 37:04.330
- Who?
- Derek Robbins.

37:04.364 --> 37:05.965
Where is he?

37:05.999 --> 37:07.176
I'm sorry, I don't know who that is.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.385
Where is he?

37:08.410 --> 37:10.088
I told you. I would never hurt a child.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.932
Erin!

37:13.373 --> 37:18.307
You have three seconds to
tell me where Derek Robbins is.

37:20.867 --> 37:22.127
Erin, stop.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.457
If you don't want
any part of this, get out.

37:23.481 --> 37:25.515
- No, don't do this...
- Hailey, get out!

37:29.222 --> 37:33.125
I need an address. Now.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.897
Okay, I'm gonna get
Area Central up to speed.

37:38.932 --> 37:40.409
Yeah, have them update the Amber Alert.

37:40.433 --> 37:42.768
I'll... I'll put together
an attack team.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.169
Chief.

37:44.204 --> 37:46.038
- Chief.
- I heard you made a pinch.

37:46.072 --> 37:48.874
Where's the suspect in
the Hendricks-Metcalf murders?

37:48.908 --> 37:50.743
You know what? I'm guessing they

37:50.777 --> 37:52.388
brought him to the restroom.
I'll go check for you.

37:52.412 --> 37:54.246
- The restroom?
- Yeah...

37:54.280 --> 37:56.315
Get the hell out of my way.

38:06.259 --> 38:07.860
Really?

38:07.894 --> 38:09.038
You mind telling me what the hell's

38:09.062 --> 38:11.063
going on here, Sergeant?

38:11.097 --> 38:13.899
Look, I just got here myself,
but, from what it looks like,

38:13.933 --> 38:15.901
this arrestee must have
attacked my detectives.

38:15.935 --> 38:17.770
I think the boy's at 3400 Racine

38:17.804 --> 38:19.238
in a car near the old stockyards.

38:19.272 --> 38:21.040
We've got a missing tender age, Chief.

38:21.074 --> 38:23.742
- We gotta move, let's go...
- You go, you're staying.

38:23.777 --> 38:25.110
And you.

38:42.128 --> 38:44.863
Over there.

38:47.300 --> 38:48.534
Nothing.

38:51.337 --> 38:52.905
It's empty.

38:52.939 --> 38:54.840
Hey, pop the trunk!

38:54.874 --> 38:56.408
Pop the trunk! Come on!

39:24.404 --> 39:26.338
Jay...

39:31.044 --> 39:34.179
Jay, he's gone, man.

39:34.214 --> 39:36.348
He's gone. He's gone.

39:38.518 --> 39:40.119
He's gone.

39:53.933 --> 39:58.303
Well, I spoke to the ME.

39:58.338 --> 40:03.242
He'd been dead at least two hours.

40:03.276 --> 40:07.045
There was nothing anybody
could have done, so.

40:20.226 --> 40:21.560
Erin.

40:23.463 --> 40:25.364
Come here a second.

40:34.641 --> 40:37.476
They want to see you
at the review board at 9:00 a.m.

40:43.416 --> 40:46.552
Remember what I told you
when you were 16,

40:46.586 --> 40:49.087
and you first came to live at my house?

40:53.126 --> 40:54.259
I'm with you...

40:54.294 --> 40:56.195
Until the wheels come off.

41:30.096 --> 41:32.397
<i>Come in.</i>

41:41.229 --> 41:43.218
Have a seat, Detective.

41:45.544 --> 41:50.570
