WEBVTT

00:03.472 --> 00:04.905
We're gonna miss you,
Principal Fisher.

00:05.007 --> 00:08.909
I can't believe you're retiring.
You don't look a day over eighty.

00:09.011 --> 00:11.946
Lilly, he's only sixty-five.

00:12.815 --> 00:15.283
Really? Is he sick?

00:16.351 --> 00:18.114
He will be after he sees this.

00:19.488 --> 00:22.082
Let's see what farewell words
Dandruff Danny has

00:22.157 --> 00:23.385
for Principal Fisher.

00:23.692 --> 00:26.126
One second, let me fix my hair.

00:27.329 --> 00:28.819
This is gonna take a while.

00:29.498 --> 00:31.989
Uh, I was just kidding about before, sir.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.863
It's not that you're old,
it's that you remind me

00:33.969 --> 00:36.460
of my dead grandfather.

00:36.572 --> 00:40.702
But he didn't die from old age.
He got hit by a school bus.

00:40.809 --> 00:42.902
Ironic, isn't it?

00:44.613 --> 00:46.240
Uh, Principal Fisher.

00:46.348 --> 00:49.215
Now, Oken, I hope this is not
some sort of video farewell

00:49.284 --> 00:52.014
for a beloved retiring principal.

00:53.188 --> 00:54.246
Hey.

00:54.723 --> 00:57.749
All right, you girls, hold it right there!

00:58.260 --> 01:01.388
- I want to do mine over again.
- We'll clean it up in editing.

01:02.297 --> 01:03.491
Miley.

01:04.032 --> 01:05.431
Miley?

01:06.335 --> 01:07.393
Miley.

01:09.571 --> 01:13.837
Move over girls.
Listen, Jake, and listen good.

01:13.909 --> 01:16.639
There's only one dame in the world
that's right for a guy like you

01:16.712 --> 01:18.236
and you're looking at her.

01:18.313 --> 01:21.009
What took you so long, baby?

01:21.149 --> 01:23.617
Traffic. Now plant one on me

01:23.685 --> 01:26.745
and make me remember
why I waste my time with you.

01:26.855 --> 01:28.789
Miley! Miley!

01:28.891 --> 01:29.880
What?

01:30.192 --> 01:32.092
You were dreaming about Jake again,
weren't you?

01:32.160 --> 01:35.186
No, I wasn't. Why would you say that?
I'm so over him.

01:35.931 --> 01:38.092
- Hey, Miley.
- I'm over you, okay?

01:38.166 --> 01:39.224
Move on with your life!

01:40.502 --> 01:42.527
I was just gonna tell her
her shoe's untied.

01:42.771 --> 01:43.760
Whoa!

01:50.379 --> 01:51.471
<i> Come on!</i>

01:51.914 --> 01:54.610
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

01:55.951 --> 01:58.943
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

01:59.054 --> 02:03.184
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

02:03.292 --> 02:07.695
<i>It's really you,</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

02:07.763 --> 02:11.563
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

02:11.633 --> 02:16.798
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:16.872 --> 02:21.172
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:21.243 --> 02:22.767
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

02:22.844 --> 02:24.675
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

02:24.780 --> 02:29.046
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:29.117 --> 02:30.812
<i>Mix it all together</i>

02:30.886 --> 02:33.912
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

02:36.658 --> 02:38.649
<i>If we were a movie</i>

02:38.727 --> 02:40.388
<i>You'd be the right guy</i>

02:40.495 --> 02:42.395
<i>And I'd be the best friend</i>

02:42.497 --> 02:43.987
<i>That you'd fall in love with</i>

02:44.099 --> 02:45.691
And I can't sing this anymore.

02:46.735 --> 02:48.703
I mean, it's not like
girls just stand around

02:48.770 --> 02:51.034
dreaming about boys all day.

02:51.740 --> 02:53.469
<i>You okay, darling?</i>

02:54.810 --> 02:56.038
Of course, I'm fine.

02:56.144 --> 02:58.704
It's just there's other
more important things in life,

02:58.814 --> 03:01.783
like world peace, and...

03:01.850 --> 03:03.579
Whales.

03:03.819 --> 03:09.314
Why can't we do a song about whales?
And not stupid boy whales. Girl whales.

03:09.424 --> 03:12.484
Happy, independent girl whales.

03:12.694 --> 03:14.184
<i>I'll get right on it, darling. </i>

03:14.296 --> 03:16.264
<i> Girl whales,</i>
<i>doing their nails</i>

03:16.331 --> 03:17.389
<i>Don't need no males</i>

03:17.499 --> 03:19.490
<i>Practically writes itself. </i>

03:19.935 --> 03:22.199
Daddy, I'm not saying
that's exactly the song.

03:22.304 --> 03:24.295
I'm open to other fish, too.

03:24.373 --> 03:27.672
- Can I take a break?
- <i>I think that's a good idea. </i>

03:29.745 --> 03:31.610
Besides, there's somebody here
who wants to see you.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.240
Dad, I'm not in the mood
to see anybody right now.

03:34.316 --> 03:35.715
Well, fine.

03:38.887 --> 03:41.219
If you don't wanna see me,
I'll just turn the bus around

03:41.289 --> 03:43.883
- and head on back to Nashville.
- Aunt Dolly!

03:43.959 --> 03:45.688
Look at you. My goodness.

03:45.761 --> 03:49.060
You are sprouting like a rosebush
after a month of rain,

03:49.131 --> 03:51.861
only not as wet and twice as pretty.

03:51.933 --> 03:54.925
Whoa doggies, I like that.
I might use that in a song.

03:55.103 --> 03:58.937
Well, fine. First one's free,
next one you share profits with me.

03:59.408 --> 04:00.841
Come in here, sweet pea.

04:00.942 --> 04:04.275
I got a story to tell you
about this possum and a skunk

04:04.379 --> 04:06.847
that were sharing a pew at church.

04:08.917 --> 04:11.579
Okay, what's his name?

04:11.653 --> 04:12.984
What are you talking about?

04:13.055 --> 04:16.616
I am talking about my goddaughter
crushing over some boy

04:16.690 --> 04:20.923
harder than a monster truck
driving over a little clown car.

04:22.931 --> 04:24.922
Monster trucks, clown cars.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.800
Oh, I've missed you, Aunt Dolly.
You're funny.

04:28.904 --> 04:30.201
You know,
we're thinking about getting a dog.

04:30.305 --> 04:34.401
Really? Well, you might
want to think about naming him Zippy,

04:34.476 --> 04:37.445
because zip
is what I'm getting from you.

04:38.613 --> 04:40.444
Listen, sweet pea,

04:40.549 --> 04:44.178
when you decide
you want to talk about this boy

04:44.252 --> 04:46.015
that don't exist,

04:46.288 --> 04:47.915
you know I'm here for you.

04:49.224 --> 04:50.816
<i>And I'm here, too, bud. </i>

04:51.493 --> 04:54.291
Robbie Ray, you nosy hillbilly!

04:55.297 --> 04:58.892
<i>Hey, I'm not listening. </i>
<i>I just wanted you to know I'm here. </i>

04:58.967 --> 05:03.301
<i>And I'm not a nosy hillbilly. </i>
<i>I'm a concerned hillbilly father. </i>

05:10.479 --> 05:12.538
- Morning, Dolly.
- Hey.

05:12.614 --> 05:13.672
Whoa!

05:13.782 --> 05:19.186
Looks like my home's been invaded
by aliens from the Planet Froufrou.

05:20.388 --> 05:23.221
Robbie Stewart,
you keep making fun of my decorating,

05:23.291 --> 05:27.022
I'm gonna have to tell your kids
how you used to run around in a diaper

05:27.095 --> 05:31.088
and little black boots saying,
"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. "

05:33.401 --> 05:35.767
Come to think of it,
I love what you've done with the place.

05:37.005 --> 05:41.032
Hey, good. Would you just say that
to the folks back home?

05:41.143 --> 05:43.805
And while you're at it,
would you please tell Uncle Zeke

05:43.879 --> 05:47.440
to get rid of that
awful mullet comb-over?

05:47.549 --> 05:51.041
Lord knows how that man can
take one hair, wrap it completely

05:51.119 --> 05:53.610
around his head and down his back.

05:55.323 --> 05:58.451
It's called a skullet, and it ain't that bad.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.256
Well, you ain't seen him floss with it.

06:02.664 --> 06:05.599
- Ready?
- Hey, everybody. Hey, Uncle Zeke.

06:05.700 --> 06:09.261
You might want to treat yourself
to a haircut, and get you a toothpick.

06:09.337 --> 06:11.032
- I'm going for a jog.
- Okay.

06:11.106 --> 06:12.266
Oh, man.

06:12.340 --> 06:15.104
- This is not good.
- Oh, what's the matter with you?

06:15.343 --> 06:18.540
Aunt Dolly, I smell like a petunia.

06:18.613 --> 06:19.978
What did you wash this stuff in?

06:20.048 --> 06:24.314
Well, just a little fabric softener
and a whole lot of love.

06:24.419 --> 06:26.444
You got anything to say
to the folks back home?

06:26.521 --> 06:28.785
Well, sure. Hey, everybody.

06:28.857 --> 06:33.487
When the guys get a whiff of me,
I'm gonna get beat up today! Bye.

06:36.097 --> 06:38.725
Well, at least you got a look at him
before that happens.

06:38.800 --> 06:42.167
So, let's go check on Miley
and see what she's up to.

06:42.270 --> 06:43.396
Come on.

06:44.839 --> 06:50.038
<i> If we were a movie</i>
<i>You'd be the right guy</i>

06:50.412 --> 06:52.642
<i>I'd be the best friend</i>

06:52.747 --> 06:55.045
<i>That you'd fall in love with</i>

06:55.150 --> 06:58.608
<i>In the end we'd be laughing</i>

06:58.687 --> 07:01.918
<i>Watching the sunset fade to black</i>

07:02.023 --> 07:07.359
<i>Show the names,</i>
<i>play that happy song</i>

07:08.630 --> 07:11.758
Well, that was just beautiful,
sweet pea.

07:12.100 --> 07:15.934
I can't wait to hear you sing it,
when there really is a boy.

07:18.139 --> 07:20.300
His name is Jake. Jake Ryan.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.172
The zombie slayer?

07:22.978 --> 07:26.414
"Dude, I slayed you
once. Don't make me slay you again. "

07:27.482 --> 07:30.280
That boy is too cute!

07:30.619 --> 07:32.746
I know. He goes to my school.

07:32.921 --> 07:35.515
And sometimes
he can be really obnoxious,

07:35.624 --> 07:39.856
but then he gets really sweet
and then he gets all obnoxious again.

07:41.329 --> 07:43.957
That reminds me.
I gotta call my husband.

07:45.367 --> 07:48.063
Aunt Dolly, puberty crisis here.

07:53.642 --> 07:56.975
Darling, I am so sorry.

07:57.646 --> 07:59.944
I just forget sometimes.

08:00.749 --> 08:02.239
Being a teenage girl

08:02.350 --> 08:06.582
is harder than walking through
a balloon shop with a porcupine purse.

08:08.256 --> 08:10.690
I don't know what to do, Aunt Dolly.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.851
Jake said he likes me
'cause I'm the only girl at school

08:12.927 --> 08:14.622
who's not falling all over him.

08:14.696 --> 08:17.961
And if I tell him that I like him,
then I am falling all over him.

08:18.066 --> 08:21.263
I'm caught between a rock
and a zombie slayer here.

08:21.569 --> 08:25.198
Well, honey, nobody knows what's
around the corner but I know one thing,

08:25.307 --> 08:27.775
if you keep yourself out of the game
for fear of losing,

08:27.876 --> 08:30.777
there is no way on this Earth
you're gonna win.

08:30.979 --> 08:34.607
So you're saying that I should
just walk up to Jake and say,

08:34.716 --> 08:37.378
" Jake Ryan, I'm through
pretending that I don't like you,

08:37.452 --> 08:41.217
"when the truth is...
I'm totally in love with you. "

08:43.024 --> 08:46.016
Wait a minute. Is this thing on?

08:46.928 --> 08:49.920
Oh, good golly, Miss Dolly.

08:50.031 --> 08:52.966
You know what?
I am forever leaving this thing on.

08:53.068 --> 08:55.332
Last Christmas,
I got four hours of the dog

08:55.437 --> 08:57.803
chewing the head off
the Little Drummer Boy.

08:58.873 --> 09:02.639
Poor little old Rufus
was chucking up body parts for a week.

09:04.145 --> 09:06.306
Uh, Aunt Dolly,
I think your hair's ringing.

09:06.381 --> 09:09.873
Well, honey, when your pants
are as tight as mine,

09:09.984 --> 09:13.420
you've got to have somewhere
to put your phone.

09:13.988 --> 09:17.321
Hey, sweetie,
I was just talking about you.

09:18.426 --> 09:21.793
Rufus ate what? No.

09:22.263 --> 09:23.696
I'll be right back.

09:23.765 --> 09:26.165
He did? The one out on the patio?

09:29.371 --> 09:31.965
Miles, I gotta get this video in today
and you're the only one

09:32.073 --> 09:33.904
who hasn't said goodbye
to Principal Fisher.

09:33.975 --> 09:37.172
So take your time,
think of something really good.

09:37.245 --> 09:40.646
- And, action!
- Okay.

09:40.749 --> 09:42.114
Bye.

09:43.051 --> 09:45.451
Perfect! Muffins!

09:49.591 --> 09:51.456
Bye. Why didn't I do that?

09:51.526 --> 09:54.427
"A day over eighty. "
What was I thinking?

09:56.831 --> 09:58.059
Oh, that's my mom.

09:58.133 --> 10:00.897
I have to get to school early
so I can turn this thing in to the editor.

10:00.969 --> 10:02.436
Oliver, let's go!

10:03.571 --> 10:05.596
I thought you said that was your mom.

10:05.707 --> 10:07.004
It is.

10:08.343 --> 10:12.837
When she's mad,
she uses her man voice.

10:13.114 --> 10:15.139
Move, move, move!

10:16.418 --> 10:18.113
Wait a minute.
I thought he took his camera.

10:18.186 --> 10:19.483
Oh, that's Aunt Dolly's.

10:19.954 --> 10:22.184
Funny. It looks a lot like Oliver's.

10:22.257 --> 10:25.420
Yeah, but Aunt Dolly's has her initials
on it. See?

10:25.493 --> 10:28.519
Where's the "D"?
Where's the rhinestone "D"?

10:28.630 --> 10:31.599
Miley, it's just a camera.
What's the big deal?

10:31.666 --> 10:33.327
That camera has a tape of me saying,

10:33.435 --> 10:35.630
" Jake Ryan, I'm totally
in love with you!"

10:35.703 --> 10:37.295
- Whoa!
- I know.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.371
- Hey, Jake.
- What's up?

10:44.479 --> 10:46.640
Quick, Oliver, you took
the wrong camera. Give it back.

10:46.748 --> 10:48.648
- Sorry. Here.
- Thanks.

10:49.818 --> 10:52.218
- Where's the tape?
- I gave it to the editor.

10:52.420 --> 10:53.944
- Who's the editor?
- Jake.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.687
Jake who?

11:04.232 --> 11:05.597
Ow, ow, ow!

11:06.901 --> 11:09.699
Thanks a lot.
You ripped out my only chest hair.

11:11.105 --> 11:14.131
So I gave Jake the tape.
Just go ask for it back.

11:14.876 --> 11:16.537
I can't believe I have to do this.

11:16.611 --> 11:18.738
Jake, can we have our tape back?

11:18.813 --> 11:21.714
Please. I looked great.
She looked terrible.

11:21.783 --> 11:23.808
- Better than you!
- Keep dreaming!

11:23.952 --> 11:27.183
- Uh, Jake?
- One second.

11:27.856 --> 11:29.949
Guys, if I let you redo your tape,

11:30.024 --> 11:32.083
then everyone's gonna want to do
the same thing.

11:32.193 --> 11:34.320
I'm sorry, but nobody
gets their tapes back

11:34.429 --> 11:36.056
under any circumstances.

11:37.332 --> 11:39.926
So, uh, Miley, what's going on?

11:40.635 --> 11:43.627
I just wanted to tell you that

11:43.705 --> 11:45.866
I know another guy named Jake Ryan.

11:45.940 --> 11:49.341
So if you ever hear me
talking about Jake Ryan,

11:49.410 --> 11:54.404
I'm talking about the other Jake Ryan.
Not you, Jake. Other Jake. Bye-bye.

11:56.451 --> 11:57.816
You're dead to me.

12:06.294 --> 12:09.263
Dad, I don't know why,
but I have this funny feeling

12:09.330 --> 12:11.525
that Aunt Dolly replaced my shampoo.

12:13.468 --> 12:14.457
Whoa!

12:14.536 --> 12:16.470
Well, join the club, Son.

12:16.538 --> 12:20.634
Looks like we've been volumised
and Dolly-sized.

12:20.875 --> 12:22.308
I can't take this anymore, Dad.

12:22.377 --> 12:25.778
Between the shampoo
and the smelly tissues,

12:25.880 --> 12:28.144
and the potpourri,

12:28.216 --> 12:30.207
and all these flowers, I mean,

12:30.418 --> 12:32.545
I'm losing my manly essence!

12:32.754 --> 12:34.654
There's only one thing we can do, Son.

12:34.756 --> 12:37.452
Let's go to the gym
and fight back with the one thing

12:37.559 --> 12:41.154
she can't take from us. Our man stink!

12:41.229 --> 12:43.163
Uh, Dad, can we maybe do it tomorrow?

12:43.231 --> 12:45.722
Aunt Dolly buffed my nails
and I don't want to ruin them.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.528
Do you hear yourself, Son?

12:48.169 --> 12:49.727
Oh, no! Get me to the gym, fast!

12:57.879 --> 12:59.779
We've got to
figure out something, Lilly.

12:59.881 --> 13:02.008
Jake's probably laughing
at that tape right now.

13:02.116 --> 13:05.142
I know, this is awful! This is horrible!

13:05.219 --> 13:08.279
This is so cute!

13:08.356 --> 13:10.347
Can I borrow it?

13:11.593 --> 13:12.992
Put that away, Lilly,

13:13.061 --> 13:15.393
I've got something else
for you girls to wear.

13:15.463 --> 13:17.988
Thanks, Aunt Dolly, but clothes
aren't going to help me now.

13:18.066 --> 13:20.034
Oh, these will.

13:21.135 --> 13:24.468
I got you girls into this mess,
and I'm gonna get you out.

13:24.672 --> 13:30.406
If that boy won't give the tape back,
we're going in after it, undercover.

13:31.045 --> 13:33.309
Ooh, I like the way she thinks.

13:35.149 --> 13:39.677
- And I love the way she accessorizes.
- These boots are made for sneaking.

14:11.686 --> 14:15.383
Girls, I don't just rock, I roll.

14:16.658 --> 14:18.990
Okay, let's just focus on the plan.

14:19.060 --> 14:22.086
Aunt Dolly and I go into the edit room.
Lilly, you stand watch.

14:22.163 --> 14:23.653
We get the tape and we're out of here.

14:23.898 --> 14:25.058
Okay.

14:26.968 --> 14:28.060
It's locked!

14:28.136 --> 14:32.004
Not for long.
These nails ain't just for scratching.

14:34.342 --> 14:35.741
Like a charm.

14:35.810 --> 14:39.268
I haven't carried a house key in years.

14:39.547 --> 14:42.710
Okay, people, let's get her done!

14:50.558 --> 14:51.650
Lilly,

14:51.726 --> 14:53.557
less squeaky, more sneaky.

14:54.962 --> 14:55.986
Sorry.

14:58.299 --> 15:01.359
- Oh, no, he's in there.
What do we do?

15:09.343 --> 15:11.903
I'm sorry, honey.
Mind if I clean up in here?

15:12.013 --> 15:14.106
Well, it don't matter
because I'm gonna clean up anyhow,

15:14.215 --> 15:15.773
so don't sass me, boy.

15:17.251 --> 15:18.343
No problem.

15:19.554 --> 15:22.819
Oh, one sec. Since you're here,
I might as well toss this.

15:22.890 --> 15:26.917
Oh, wait! Don't you want to finish that?
You're a growing boy.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.053
Nah. I eat too much
of this junk anyway.

15:29.130 --> 15:31.792
Uh, can't let you do that. Union rules.

15:34.769 --> 15:35.997
I'll take care of it.

15:36.070 --> 15:39.369
I'll just toss it
to the left of the trash can.

15:47.682 --> 15:49.547
Whoa, what the heck is in there?

15:49.650 --> 15:53.643
Well, I guess that dead lab frog
still has a little hop left in him.

15:55.056 --> 15:58.116
Sweet niblets, you are Jake Ryan!

15:58.192 --> 16:00.592
- You are Jake, aren't you?
- Yes.

16:00.695 --> 16:03.892
You're as cute as they said.
Can I have your autograph?

16:03.965 --> 16:05.091
Sure.

16:07.802 --> 16:11.363
It's really for my goddaughter.
I mean, she just loves you.

16:11.439 --> 16:13.907
Really, she loves you.

16:16.644 --> 16:19.238
That's that dang frog again.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.409
Hey, what happened to all my tapes?

16:21.482 --> 16:24.280
Hey, didn't you say that very line

16:24.352 --> 16:26.946
in the famous
lost zombie tape episode?

16:27.655 --> 16:28.849
Yeah. Some of my finest work.

16:28.923 --> 16:32.586
Well, I have heard about you.
I've heard you do some great stuff.

16:32.693 --> 16:37.153
And you are as cute as they say.
Well, gotta go, while the getting's good.

16:37.465 --> 16:40.127
Oh, uh, one more thing.

16:40.368 --> 16:42.427
Shake in the hole!

16:49.110 --> 16:50.805
Did you get it?

16:53.114 --> 16:56.174
Oh, I got it. I got it good.

16:59.754 --> 17:01.949
- Strawberry.
- Oh, my favorite.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.624
Breathe that in, Son.

17:12.733 --> 17:14.359
That's the sweet stench

17:14.435 --> 17:17.598
of independence, freedom
and manly pride.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.368
I hear you, Daddy.

17:24.712 --> 17:27.203
My eyes are burning, my eyes.

17:27.281 --> 17:30.307
I'm so ranky, I taste my own stanky.

17:30.718 --> 17:34.415
I can't stand it! I'm taking a shower.
And I'm using Aunt Dolly's

17:34.522 --> 17:37.116
peach body wash
with exfoliating loofah glove.

17:38.292 --> 17:40.556
Well, you loofah all you want to,

17:40.628 --> 17:44.564
I'm gonna take a bubble bath
with one of her citrus fizzy balls.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.999
Maybe two.

17:53.808 --> 17:55.867
What are you so upset about?
You got your tape back.

17:56.210 --> 17:58.678
I know I should be happy, but I'm not.

17:59.347 --> 18:00.371
I mean, it makes sense.

18:00.481 --> 18:03.279
You're right back where you started,
secretly crushing on Jake.

18:03.351 --> 18:04.943
If I were you,
I would've listened to your Aunt Dolly

18:05.019 --> 18:06.577
and just tell him how you feel.

18:06.687 --> 18:09.315
Why didn't you tell me that yesterday?

18:10.124 --> 18:13.355
Because I wanted to wear
the cool black outfit.

18:14.962 --> 18:18.022
Okay, I'm just gonna do it.
I'm gonna tell him the truth.

18:18.099 --> 18:20.659
You know, he might think
I'm falling all over him,

18:20.768 --> 18:23.862
- but at least he'll know how I feel.
- And maybe he'll feel the same way.

18:23.938 --> 18:26.668
- Yeah, you're right. It's worth the risk.
- Yeah.

18:26.741 --> 18:28.902
- I'll never know unless I try.
- Yeah.

18:29.443 --> 18:30.933
Here I go.

18:31.913 --> 18:34.143
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey, Miley.

18:34.248 --> 18:36.716
- Listen, I have something to tell you...
- Hi, Jakey.

18:36.784 --> 18:37.978
Hey, Rach.

18:38.085 --> 18:42.579
Oh, Miley, you know Rachel, right?
From Spanish class?

18:42.790 --> 18:45.987
Oh, sure. Hi, Rachel.

18:46.527 --> 18:49.189
Yeah, we're kind of going out now.

18:49.263 --> 18:50.696
Isn't that great?

18:51.766 --> 18:54.394
Yeah. Really great.

18:54.936 --> 18:57.461
So, uh, what was it
that you wanted to tell me?

18:58.306 --> 19:00.467
Nothing. It's not important anymore.

19:01.175 --> 19:03.905
All right. Well, see you around.

19:05.513 --> 19:08.949
Yeah, see you around.

19:14.255 --> 19:15.813
He loves me not.

19:15.923 --> 19:17.823
Still not loving me.

19:17.892 --> 19:19.553
Too busy loving Rachel.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.389
And he still ain't loving me,
and now he's not loving me anymore,

19:23.464 --> 19:25.193
and now I need more petals.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.802
You got any ideas
what we're gonna do about this?

19:28.869 --> 19:32.430
Have you ever known me
not to have an idea?

19:32.506 --> 19:34.531
Just follow my lead.

19:35.276 --> 19:37.710
So, Robbie, do you remember
when you were trying

19:37.778 --> 19:40.372
to get up the courage
to ask Miley's mom out

19:40.481 --> 19:42.540
and she just turned you down flat?

19:42.717 --> 19:45.379
Yep. She said
she was already dating somebody else.

19:45.553 --> 19:47.418
And do you remember what I told you?

19:47.521 --> 19:51.013
Yep. You said,
"Next time you're gonna ask a girl out,

19:51.092 --> 19:54.220
"don't wash your truck,
wash your hair. "

19:54.295 --> 19:55.694
I mean after that.

19:56.130 --> 19:59.827
Yep. You said,
"The only way to not be in the game,

19:59.900 --> 20:01.868
"is to take yourself out of the game. "

20:01.936 --> 20:04.769
Guys, I know what you all
are trying to do, but let's face it,

20:04.872 --> 20:08.171
I waited too long. I blew it. Game over.

20:08.376 --> 20:11.345
Robbie, is this the same girl
that came to me

20:11.412 --> 20:14.438
and said, "I want to be a singer. "

20:14.548 --> 20:19.144
And I said, "Sweet pea, the chances
of that happening are one in a million. "

20:19.620 --> 20:22.487
And she said, "I want to be that one. "

20:23.858 --> 20:27.021
- Where's that girl?
- She's right here.

20:29.263 --> 20:31.288
Well, if you hadn't taken that risk,

20:31.365 --> 20:34.266
you never would've become
Hannah Montana, now would you?

20:34.835 --> 20:36.063
No.

20:37.605 --> 20:39.004
So...

20:39.573 --> 20:43.703
So if I want something bad enough,
I should get off my butt and fight for it.

20:43.778 --> 20:48.943
That's right. That reminds me
of a song by my favorite teen pop star.

20:49.016 --> 20:52.281
<i>Who said, who said</i>
<i>you can't be Superman?</i>

20:52.386 --> 20:55.913
<i>I say, I say that I know you can</i>

20:57.091 --> 21:00.583
<i>Who said, who said</i>
<i>you can't be worldwide?</i>

21:00.661 --> 21:04.620
<i>I say, I say time is on your side</i>

21:04.965 --> 21:08.332
<i>Who said, who said</i>
<i> Jake won't be the guy?</i>

21:08.402 --> 21:12.395
<i>I say, I say give it another try</i>

21:13.074 --> 21:16.635
<i>Who said, who said</i>
<i>you can't be ten feet tall?</i>

21:16.744 --> 21:21.408
<i>I say, I say that I can have it all</i>

21:21.482 --> 21:23.006
Who said?

21:26.420 --> 21:29.685
- Oh, I love it.
Who said?

21:32.193 --> 21:34.559
Have you been using
my citrus fizzy balls?

21:34.662 --> 21:37.563
No, ma'am.
But I did use your apricot scrub.

21:48.509 --> 21:49.498
You know, Aunt Dolly,

21:49.577 --> 21:51.943
I kind of modelled
Hannah Montana's look after you.

21:52.012 --> 21:54.640
Really? I thought I was missing a wig!

21:56.684 --> 21:59.881
Don't make me smile. I'm cracking.

22:07.027 --> 22:12.124
You know, this avocado mask tastes
ten times better than the mango scrub.

22:12.299 --> 22:15.200
You know, Rufus ate a whole bowl
of that mango scrub once.

22:15.302 --> 22:18.430
For a whole week, that little dog
smelled like a tropical breeze

22:18.539 --> 22:20.700
coming and going.

22:21.642 --> 22:23.974
Cool. Can't wait.
