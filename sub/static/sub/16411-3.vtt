That's horrible, man.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.959
Totally insane, right?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.750
Really horrible. Why would
anyone want to see that, man?

14:39.750 --> 14:43.458
We see it as having
an application towards empathy
training for prisoners,

14:43.458 --> 14:45.917
you know, to help them
relate to their victims.

14:45.917 --> 14:49.542
Yeah, well,
it's pretty intense.

14:49.542 --> 14:52.625
Just wait. We're doing
a simulation of what
it would be like

14:52.625 --> 14:55.959

accident from 2010.

14:55.959 --> 14:57.625

Yeah.
