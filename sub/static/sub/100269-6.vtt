WEBVTT

00:18.351 --> 00:21.688
Who here among us really knew Henderson?

00:22.814 --> 00:26.234
The famous belong to everyone
and none of us.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.195
Well, I knew him pretty well, I think.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.906
One time, before I was
about to go onstage,

00:31.990 --> 00:35.827
some dude comes over
and dumps wine all over my front

00:35.910 --> 00:36.828
on purpose.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.416
Well, Hendy sees this,
and what does he do?

00:42.375 --> 00:44.002
Number one,
he punches the guy in the face.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.756
Number two, he took off his own shirt

00:48.089 --> 00:49.090
and gave it to me.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.009
And number three,

00:51.634 --> 00:54.596
he pulled this perfectly clean bra
out of his pocket

00:55.096 --> 00:57.015
and gave that to me, too.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.810
Oh, by the way, that was
during his comedy prop era, of course.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.854
I think.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.690
The point is,
I don't care where he got the bra...

01:06.274 --> 01:08.610
I heard they found his body
in a sex dungeon.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.987
Come on, Gabe.
Don't kink-shame the dead.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.363
- No, I'm not, okay?

01:12.447 --> 01:15.075
But I loved him. You know why?

01:15.158 --> 01:17.660
He was real. Damn it, Hendy.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.913
A tale told by an idiot...

01:19.996 --> 01:24.125
<i> She's still here,</i>
<i>hanging on like a sucker fish.</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:25.835
<i>Embraced by your friends.</i>

01:25.919 --> 01:27.670
<i>Everyone's happy you get a break</i>
<i>from your gig</i>

01:27.754 --> 01:29.297
<i>as Forty's primary caregiver,</i>

01:29.380 --> 01:33.009
<i>but I will be victorious</i>
<i>in this war she has waged.</i>

01:33.093 --> 01:34.511
<i>Stop her permanently.</i>

01:34.928 --> 01:37.305
<i>Not Henderson permanently,</i>
<i>that got away from me.</i>

01:37.388 --> 01:39.265
<i>But permanently nonetheless.</i>

01:44.979 --> 01:49.901
I swear to God, if they ever find
the cowardly shit stain who did this,

01:50.401 --> 01:52.737
I'm going to bash his fucking head in.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.032
-Forty.
-I know this is hard,

01:56.116 --> 01:58.284
but you need to find a silver lining,
bunny.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.954
<i> Bunny. What an absurd nickname.</i>

02:01.037 --> 02:03.540
<i>I used to find it sweet.</i>
<i>But it's not sweet. It's psychotic.</i>

02:03.623 --> 02:05.750
<i>A bunny boiler is what she is.</i>

02:05.834 --> 02:07.210
He was murdered, babe.

02:07.293 --> 02:10.296
When my ex attacked me,
it was the worst day of my life.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.382
But I didn't lay down and die.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.801
I came out stronger.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.597
That's the thing with tragedy.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.976
It makes you live for the now.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.061
<i>Yeah. Live, for now.</i>

02:25.520 --> 02:28.439
<i>No, no. This can be managed.</i>

02:28.523 --> 02:30.483
Move in with me, Ames.

02:31.067 --> 02:34.487
Ditch the B and B, and be my <i>hausfrau.</i>

02:36.573 --> 02:37.740
Forty, Forty...

02:38.700 --> 02:41.452
maybe-- maybe it's not the best
to make big decisions

02:41.536 --> 02:43.705
when you're grieving, you know?

02:43.788 --> 02:46.833
Can you just let me have this? Please.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.293
Like...

02:49.586 --> 02:52.005
I can't be here, okay?
I, like, need some matcha.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.423
Forty.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.890
I think Vampira is buried right over here.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.857
Speaking of which,
I spy the coveted third totem.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.026
What?

03:13.151 --> 03:14.235
-Where?
-What's happening?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.987
-Wham and bam, girls.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.281
Oh, my God. I think you're right.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.367
Oh, both wearing the shit
out of that pink lacy dress.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.411
-Oh, my God! You got number three!

03:23.494 --> 03:24.913
-Right.
-Yeah!

03:24.996 --> 03:26.289
What's number three?

03:26.372 --> 03:28.333
Oh, right. You're new here. Okay, so...

03:28.875 --> 03:31.169
We have this theory--
well, it's actually Gabe's theory,

03:31.252 --> 03:33.630
which is that Los Angeles
has seven totems,

03:33.713 --> 03:36.049
and once you find all of them,
you're officially an Angeleno.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.634
-And can never leave.
-Yeah.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.261
We all found them ages ago,
but Lucy never found the dress one.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.805
-Hey, till today.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.433
-No, this one can count for you, too.
-Oh, great.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.936
<i>Stuck in LA forever,</i>
<i>what could be better?</i>

03:48.019 --> 03:48.978
Are you all right?

03:49.854 --> 03:51.898
-You seem...
-<i> Like a guy attending the memorial</i>

03:51.981 --> 03:53.983
<i>-of a guy he just killed?</i>
-...pensive.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.321
- <i>I have to keep it light for you.</i>
-It's funerals.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.114
Of course. Um, yeah.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.325
-So, what are these totems?
- Oh, oh!

04:02.408 --> 04:04.661
-Got it, lovely. Thank you.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.329
Uh, number one,

04:06.412 --> 04:08.456
a rollerblader in booty shorts.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.793
Number two, a ghetto bird. Um...

04:12.669 --> 04:13.628
Police helicopter.

04:13.711 --> 04:19.008
Number three, two starlets wearing
the same dress, as observed.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.011
-Uh, number four, a pack of coyotes.
- Oh, yeah.

04:22.095 --> 04:26.099
Right? Yeah.
Number five, a dog in a stroller.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.434
Number six, an off-brand superhero.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.352
But out of context,

04:29.435 --> 04:31.729
not in front of Grauman's
'cause that's too easy.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.649
Yes, of course. Uh, and number seven,

04:34.732 --> 04:36.859
a palm tree... on fire.

04:36.943 --> 04:37.860
-On fire.
-Yes.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.070
-It's on fire.
- Right.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.446
-Sounds intense.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.489
Yeah, they are.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.660
<i>Of course Delilah is here</i>
<i>with a flask.</i>

04:45.994 --> 04:48.997
<i>This must be hard on her. That's my fault.</i>

04:49.580 --> 04:52.917
<i>But I saved her sister from far worse.</i>
<i>This I know.</i>

04:53.293 --> 04:54.711
Especially in the rain.

04:57.338 --> 05:01.050
Hey, um, I gotta pop by work. So, later?

05:01.509 --> 05:05.221
<i> A celebrity has died suspiciously.</i>
<i>They'll work harder to solve it.</i>

05:05.305 --> 05:07.223
<i>Did I do enough at the scene?</i>

05:07.432 --> 05:10.351
-Is there a problem, Officer?
-Little late to be taking out the trash.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.686
-For Goodwill.
-<i> Hey.</i>

05:12.353 --> 05:14.272
-Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.440
I'm sorry. Of course.

05:17.817 --> 05:18.860
I wolf you.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.903
I wolf you so hard.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.074
Okay.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.118
Bye, guys.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.245
-Bye, Lovey.
-Bye, babe.

05:30.913 --> 05:34.208
<i>Thanks to Forty, I have new intel.</i>
<i>Candace has an Airbnb.</i>

05:34.292 --> 05:37.086
<i>She needs a place to lower the mask,</i>
<i>to be herself.</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:40.882
<i>I'm going to find it,</i>
<i>and when I do, Hollywood ending.</i>

06:00.735 --> 06:03.029
Happy anniversary, Mr. Kennedy.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.669
I'm getting around to it.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.672
I know, I know, it's not feminist.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.092
I want to.
I want our kids to have it, too.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.762
Proposition?

06:28.763 --> 06:29.764
It's been a year.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.684
Let's do it, while we're young.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.520
And then when we're in our 40s,

06:35.603 --> 06:37.480
we can drive around
in a big painted van

06:37.563 --> 06:38.731
like the Partridge Family.

06:41.692 --> 06:42.985
Well? Thoughts?

06:44.987 --> 06:48.241
If we know what we want, why wait?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.999
We can have both.

06:58.126 --> 07:02.130
For example, I heard
the new walk-in's not hooked up yet.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.595
Anyone could walk in.

07:11.931 --> 07:12.974
Mm-hmm.

07:52.263 --> 07:55.725
<i>What Candace and I had was</i>
<i>never real. I'm certain of that now.</i>

07:56.225 --> 08:00.146
<i>The way she lies. Effortless.</i>
<i>Like... breathing.</i>

08:00.229 --> 08:02.940
<i>I feel bad for Forty.</i>
<i>He can't resist her Lolita act</i>

08:03.024 --> 08:04.275
<i>any more than I could.</i>

08:04.484 --> 08:06.027
<i>Is she sleeping with him?</i>

08:06.110 --> 08:08.946
<i>Or did she make up some lie</i>
<i>to get out of that, too?</i>

08:09.530 --> 08:13.117
<i>Maybe she's decided it's an acceptable</i>
<i>price to pay to ruin my life.</i>

08:13.201 --> 08:14.869
<i>Or maybe they're in love.</i>

08:16.245 --> 08:19.332
<i>One upside</i>
<i>to Forty's constant online pleas</i>

08:19.415 --> 08:23.878
<i>for validation is it's easy to figure out</i>
<i>where he's gonna be, any given time.</i>

08:23.961 --> 08:26.088
<i>He's on his way now</i>
<i>to play </i>Dungeons & Dragons

08:26.172 --> 08:27.715
<i>at Joe Manganiello's house.</i>

08:27.798 --> 08:29.884
<i>He's been tweeting about it incessantly</i>
<i>for a week.</i>

08:30.968 --> 08:32.512
<i>So what's it gonna be, bunny?</i>

08:33.095 --> 08:34.972
<i>Do we tango here, or...?</i>

08:39.519 --> 08:40.728
<i>Elsewhere it is.</i>

08:43.523 --> 08:46.317
<i>The air feels charged.</i>
<i>Santa Ana winds.</i>

08:46.400 --> 08:49.403
<i>Anyone with a lick of common sense</i>
<i>would get the hell out of this town</i>

08:49.487 --> 08:50.947
<i>before it's too late.</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:54.200
<i>But not us. We had a date with destiny.</i>

08:55.368 --> 08:56.869
<i>I'm reading too much Chandler.</i>

08:58.663 --> 09:00.498
<i>Where is she going in such a hurry?</i>

09:00.581 --> 09:01.916
<i>Is she meeting someone?</i>

09:11.551 --> 09:12.802
<i>That is a cop.</i>

09:13.344 --> 09:16.430
<i>Probably unrelated,</i>
<i>but I can't be too careful.</i>

09:17.348 --> 09:21.936
<i>Shit. Okay, okay. It's possible</i>
<i>I'm the tiniest bit paranoid.</i>

09:27.275 --> 09:30.653
<i>Shit. Candace one, me zero.</i>

09:35.741 --> 09:37.243
-What's up, Ellie?
-Hey.

09:38.327 --> 09:41.497
-What you reading there, Will?
-Oh, uh, Chandler.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.042
Nice one.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.336
You should really watch the film, though.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.589
Robert Mitchum
is my second-favorite Philip Marlowe.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.132
Okay, who's your first?

09:51.215 --> 09:54.302
Just so I know who to picture when
I'm staring at the boring little words.

09:54.385 --> 09:57.722
Oh, Elliott Gould, of course. Sex on legs.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.558
Probably still can get it.

10:00.641 --> 10:03.811
<i>I'm glad to see she's feeling better</i>
<i>after all that happened with Henderson.</i>

10:04.020 --> 10:05.438
Fuck me!

10:11.527 --> 10:13.154
-What happened?

10:13.237 --> 10:16.282
I grabbed the fucking curling iron,
thought it was the brush. Ow!

10:16.449 --> 10:18.534
-You okay? Run it under cold water. Here.
-Here you go.

10:19.076 --> 10:22.747
<i>One thing I know. When a traumatized</i>
<i>woman tries to keep it together</i>

10:22.830 --> 10:25.625
<i>when she's actually falling apart,</i>
<i>this happens.</i>

10:25.708 --> 10:26.876
Is that better?

10:32.673 --> 10:35.593
-Ellie, can you get me an ice pack?
-Yeah, um...

10:40.431 --> 10:42.183
I saw you at Henderson's memorial.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.684
<i>Well, this feels like a trap.</i>

10:43.768 --> 10:46.103
-The woman I'm seeing, her brother--
-Love and Forty Quinn?

10:46.187 --> 10:47.229
Yeah, I know who they are.

10:47.897 --> 10:51.317
Forty used to take up permanent residence
in Hendy's anal cavity

10:51.400 --> 10:54.320
before he was ejected
for being a junkie prick,

10:54.403 --> 10:57.073
but far be it for me
to question the company you keep.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.744
-I'm gonna go.
-Maybe, yeah. Just...

11:02.703 --> 11:04.288
go and forget all about it,

11:04.372 --> 11:07.708
just like everybody else is gonna do
after they're done canonizing him.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.461
<i>She's not wrong. Henderson</i>
<i>may have gotten what he deserved,</i>

11:10.544 --> 11:13.839
<i>but in the eyes of the public,</i>
<i>he's a victim, a hero, even.</i>

11:13.923 --> 11:14.799
<i>That's gotta sting.</i>

11:14.882 --> 11:15.800
I'm sorry, Will.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.427
My sister's a little upset,
and she's also a bitch.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.807
I'm taking all of them down.
Beginning with his succubus of an agent,

11:22.890 --> 11:25.351
followed by anybody else
that turned a blind eye.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.560
They're all complicit.

11:26.644 --> 11:30.022
<i> She should see a doctor,</i>
<i>but if I suggest it, she might injure me.</i>

11:30.106 --> 11:31.774
Okay, Jessica Jones,

11:32.108 --> 11:34.110
four ibuprofen and a Xanny.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.488
Take it down a notch, okay?
We'll watch a movie.

11:37.571 --> 11:40.533
<i> It sucks that she has to manage</i>
<i>her sister like this.</i>

11:40.825 --> 11:43.452
Uh, Will? Maybe you wanna join?

11:43.536 --> 11:47.289
Tonight we're gonna be streaming
the 1992 classic

11:47.373 --> 11:49.667
<i>-The Player, </i>starring Tim Robbins--
-We have work to do.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.387
You're a good sister.

12:01.929 --> 12:05.599
I know. So, uh... you in?

12:06.392 --> 12:09.186
-Murder, Hollywood?
- <i>She needs someone right now,</i>

12:09.270 --> 12:11.147
<i>no matter how cool she's acting.</i>

12:11.230 --> 12:13.649
-<i>Candace can wait until tomorrow.</i>
-You got any popcorn?

12:14.233 --> 12:16.318
'Course I do. I'm not an animal.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.090
Oldest of sports.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.885
Is it bisexual pescatarian week
again already?

12:41.469 --> 12:44.305
-Man, time flies.
-What's D-FOL?

12:44.889 --> 12:47.641
<i>Dark Face of Love.</i> The "the" is silent.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.478
We are setting up a temp production office
in the back.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.605
-Who's we?
-Me and Amy.

12:53.397 --> 12:56.734
And you.
Giving you a producer credit, brohamulus.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.694
Forty, I'm not qualified.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.112
You're hilarious.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.281
It's no pay, just points on the back end,

13:02.364 --> 13:05.576
and as much festival poon
as you can schnorf.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.369
<i>He knows</i>
<i>I'm dating his sister, right?</i>

13:07.453 --> 13:09.914
Uh-oh.
Did you not get enough sleep last night?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.208
I was up late.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.876
Okay, well,

13:14.794 --> 13:16.921
still need you to sign
the production contact sheet.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.053
Okay. What's a loan-out?

13:24.637 --> 13:28.307
You can just make something up.
Like, Bettelheim Productions.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.059
Bettelheim Films. Bettel--

13:30.476 --> 13:32.228
That name is really aggressive.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.439
It's not gonna marquee well at all.
We'll brainstorm.

13:37.525 --> 13:41.070
What's Amy's address?
She didn't fill it out. So I can do it.

13:41.737 --> 13:45.199
I know it's in Echo Park.
I wanna say Loma Vista Lane?

13:45.282 --> 13:46.617
I'm not sure what the number is.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.285
<i> That's a start.</i>

13:49.787 --> 13:50.621
All right.

13:50.704 --> 13:53.415
First production meeting is 19:00.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.625
All hands on deck.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.340
<i> Sorry, Fortinbrah,</i>
<i>just made other plans.</i>

14:02.424 --> 14:03.342
Boop!

14:04.176 --> 14:05.719
-Up for a road trip?
-Where to?

14:06.220 --> 14:10.099
Glendora. It is a drive,
but the things that this donut shop does

14:10.182 --> 14:12.351
with fresh strawberries
should be considered a sex crime.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.061
That's intriguing.

14:15.479 --> 14:16.480
Pick me up at six?

14:17.064 --> 14:19.984
<i>Okay. Two hours to get</i>
<i>the tactical advantage I need</i>

14:20.067 --> 14:22.236
<i>to stop Candace. I can make this work.</i>

14:24.113 --> 14:27.950
<i>Only two rentals on Loma Vista Lane,</i>
<i>and one isn't really her speed.</i>

14:29.076 --> 14:30.786
<i>This feels more like Candace.</i>

14:30.870 --> 14:32.913
<i>The Gothic Barbie dream house.</i>

14:32.997 --> 14:35.958
<i>"Historic Victorian home</i>
<i>in Angelino Heights.</i>

14:36.041 --> 14:39.503
<i>Private bathroom, balcony. Tee-pee access.</i>

14:39.587 --> 14:42.131
<i>Rachel is a superhost</i>
<i>with a five-star rating</i>

14:42.214 --> 14:43.883
<i>who recently relocated to Berlin."</i>

14:43.966 --> 14:45.426
<i>Cross-reference Google Maps,</i>

14:46.010 --> 14:47.094
<i>and bingo.</i>

14:47.177 --> 14:49.805
<i>Candace found me, I found her.</i>

15:11.577 --> 15:13.913
<i>Toyota Camry. Same as yesterday.</i>

15:14.413 --> 15:17.666
<i>I should listen to my instincts.</i>
<i>This is bad, Love.</i>

15:17.750 --> 15:19.126
<i>Plainclothes cop?</i>

15:20.252 --> 15:22.212
<i>Henderson? Maybe Will talked?</i>

15:22.296 --> 15:26.216
<i>Jasper's associates got to him in Manila--</i>
<i>No, that's crazy.</i>

15:26.300 --> 15:28.677
<i>Dr. Nicky hired a PI from prison.</i>

15:28.802 --> 15:31.972
<i>What's he got on me?</i>
<i>Oh, no, no no.</i>

15:33.807 --> 15:35.601
<i>This city is fucking endless.</i>

15:36.977 --> 15:39.229
<i>If I can't disappear into all that...</i>

15:40.105 --> 15:42.066
<i>No, Love, I don't want to disappear.</i>

15:42.149 --> 15:44.109
<i>I want to eat donuts,</i>
<i>impress your parents.</i>

15:44.193 --> 15:47.112
<i>Hear my name, my real name, on your lips.</i>

15:49.281 --> 15:51.659
<i>Pack of-- No, thank you.</i>

16:02.211 --> 16:05.381
<i> Fucking LA traffic.</i>
<i>I'm so late for you, Love.</i>

16:07.383 --> 16:08.842
<i>Is that the Toyota?</i>

16:10.511 --> 16:13.305
<i>No, no no. Oh, Love.</i>

16:14.390 --> 16:18.143
-<i>You're having me followed.</i>

16:18.894 --> 16:20.688
<i>No. There has to be an explanation.</i>

16:26.485 --> 16:28.529
If you're gonna show up an hour late,
you should call.

16:28.612 --> 16:29.446
<i>She's furious,</i>

16:29.530 --> 16:32.282
<i>or the doors are about to fling open</i>
<i>with an army of law enforcement.</i>

16:32.366 --> 16:33.283
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

16:37.162 --> 16:38.247
I'm so sorry.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.582
Hey, I don't do apology assault, Will.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.795
You stood me up,
you'll get to apologize on my time.

16:46.547 --> 16:47.423
Understood.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.299
<i>So far, so weird.</i>

16:49.383 --> 16:51.010
<i>That doesn't look like the face of a woman</i>

16:51.093 --> 16:52.970
<i>who just learned something</i>
<i>unspeakable about her man.</i>

16:53.220 --> 16:54.805
<i>Maybe I should just...</i>

16:55.139 --> 16:56.056
Love...

16:59.143 --> 17:00.185
Is everything okay?

17:01.520 --> 17:02.938
I don't know. You tell me.

17:03.313 --> 17:07.443
When I was walking up just now,
there was a man leaving here.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.988
Yeah, that's Alec Grigoryan.
He's a private detective.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.198
My family's been using him for years.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.325
He was here, why?

17:15.826 --> 17:17.578
Well, I hired him to look into Amy.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.206
-Oh.
-<i> You trust me.</i>

17:21.290 --> 17:24.960
<i>It's Candace you don't trust</i>
<i>because you are smart and true.</i>

17:25.044 --> 17:27.129
<i>-But--</i>
-Why wouldn't you say something?

17:27.212 --> 17:30.382
It's not a big deal
unless he finds something, right?

17:32.593 --> 17:35.220
I think hiring a PI
is actually kind of a big deal.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.263
Not if you're a Quinn.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.351
I can't believe you're being so casual.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.937
I don't know why you're freaking out.
You don't even like her.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.065
Would you ever hire someone to follow me?

17:46.982 --> 17:48.942
I don't know. Why? Should I?

17:49.985 --> 17:51.403
<i>Who are you right now?</i>

17:51.487 --> 17:54.656
The thing is, people take advantage
of people with money.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.116
It's just a fact, okay?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.619
I'm not gonna apologize
for protecting my family.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.662
Ever.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.539
<i>Privilege check, aisle one.</i>

18:05.125 --> 18:06.877
-I just think--
- What?

18:17.429 --> 18:19.765
My parents offered to help.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.392
We can pay them back, and...

18:36.490 --> 18:38.033
Can we talk about this?

18:44.540 --> 18:45.874
You're just detoxing.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.302
<i>I just think...</i>

18:57.719 --> 18:59.555
I'm some spoiled rich girl?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.643
Independent, but always have
a golden parachute if I need it?

19:05.060 --> 19:07.020
<i>-</i> <i>Well, yeah.</i>
-It's not what I meant.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.605
You did.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.612
I'll call Alec tomorrow morning.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.739
Tell him to stop following Amy.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.993
I get how it's too much.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.369
Okay? I'm sorry.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.498
<i>I'm </i>sorry.

19:26.999 --> 19:31.003
I'm sorry for missing our donut pil--

19:31.795 --> 19:32.754
I told you,

19:34.214 --> 19:36.758
don't apologize.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.729
Salmonella?

19:49.938 --> 19:51.398
-You're an idiot.
-Yes.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.692
<i> No secrets, Love. Please.</i>

19:53.775 --> 19:56.153
<i>I really don't do well with secrets.</i>

19:58.822 --> 20:03.785
Barry. Okay, Barry,
don't be such a massive pussy.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.245
Just match Ray.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.582
Don't you want your name
on something relevant?

20:08.832 --> 20:11.627
Something that matters,
something-- Exactly.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.673
Yes-- Of course I'll tell my dad.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.967
Thank you, Barry. Thank you.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.636
Thank you.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.599
Barry's in the bag.
Put him down for 100K.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.810
Great. I have a hair thing.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.063
Oh, okay.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.025
Bye. Treasure you.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.820
Fucking Barry.

21:10.727 --> 21:11.895
Can I help you?

21:13.146 --> 21:14.356
I'm looking for Will.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.692
Oh, sorry. He's not home right now.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.194
I'm Amy. You are...?

21:19.569 --> 21:20.988
The building manager.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.198
Oh, cool.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.828
I love these old Deco places.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.249
I'm glad Will opted for some charm
and not some soulless condo.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.835
-How do you know Will?
-Friends.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.170
But, you know, it's complicated.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.924
You were at the memorial yesterday,
weren't you?

21:41.091 --> 21:44.553
Yeah. Hence, complicated.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.596
Will and I used to date.

21:47.097 --> 21:50.642
He has a pair of earrings
I've been <i>trying</i> to get back.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.894
-Do you think you could--
-Did you know Henderson?

21:54.187 --> 21:55.022
Forty did.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.108
His comedy really wasn't my speed.

21:58.191 --> 22:02.904
And I don't mean to speak ill of the dead,
but he seemed kind of like a perv.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.996
Oh, you can't actually come in.
It's against the law.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.707
Um, but what do they look like?

22:13.790 --> 22:15.917
Like, dangly little green stones.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.878
Do you have any idea where they might be?

22:18.003 --> 22:19.171
Um...

22:19.546 --> 22:20.422
Nightstand?

22:21.506 --> 22:23.300
Okay, I'll go-- I'll go look.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.181
So, are you from Brooklyn, too?

22:29.473 --> 22:32.225
Not originally,
but that's where I met Will.

22:32.976 --> 22:36.063
That's cute. Who followed who?

22:39.066 --> 22:39.983
I'm sorry?

22:40.067 --> 22:42.778
To LA. Did you follow him or him you?

22:42.861 --> 22:44.613
Oh. We were already broken up

22:44.696 --> 22:47.282
so more of a coincidence
that we both ended up here.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.119
Well, I didn't find any earrings.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.204
Um...

22:52.371 --> 22:53.747
Damn it.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.292
All right. I'll hit him up later.
Thank you so much.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.460
Yeah, no problem.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.181
<i>-</i> <i>This is Love.</i>
-Miss Quinn.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.351
-Alec Grigoryan.
<i>-Yeah, thanks for calling me back.</i>

23:14.434 --> 23:16.520
I've decided
I want to call off the investigation.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.021
You can charge me for the whole day.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.148
<i>Well, I think you're gonna wanna see</i>
<i>what I found. </i>

23:20.732 --> 23:21.817
Can you meet?

23:37.290 --> 23:38.959
<i> Now that you've called off the dogs,</i>

23:39.042 --> 23:41.628
<i>I can get back to the work</i>
<i>of getting Candace away from us.</i>

23:43.255 --> 23:45.590
-Hey, Casanova.
-I'm gonna keep walking, Ellie.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.135
I'm just impressed.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.680
Our little Will caught the eye
of heiress Love Quinn

23:51.763 --> 23:54.182
and is sneaking around
with a secret ex-girl.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.476
Did not think you had that much game.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.019
Ex-girl?

23:58.103 --> 24:00.439
I appreciate how you're not racist
towards gingers.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.358
Ginger? What are you talking about?

24:03.733 --> 24:06.611
Came by looking for earrings. Come on.

24:07.070 --> 24:10.240
-That's, like, gotta be code for...
- <i>Candace, here.</i>

24:10.323 --> 24:13.535
Listen to me. That woman, she's--

24:13.618 --> 24:14.703
She's what?

24:15.996 --> 24:17.456
-What?
-She's no one.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.417
-You are so lying to me right now.
-Go home.

24:21.710 --> 24:25.297
Hey, just because you're dripping
in hoo-ha doesn't mean you're all that!

24:26.381 --> 24:27.299
Asshole.

24:31.219 --> 24:34.598
<i>Candace coming here crosses a line.</i>
<i>I need a new plan.</i>

24:40.979 --> 24:43.565
<i>If you think about it,</i>
<i>she's already living on borrowed time.</i>

24:43.648 --> 24:46.526
<i>She resurrected</i>
<i>like some sort of ginger vampire</i>

24:46.610 --> 24:47.986
<i>to suck my life away.</i>

24:48.445 --> 24:51.406
<i>Dealing with her is nothing</i>
<i>but balancing the cosmic scales.</i>

24:53.825 --> 24:56.203
<i>It's not safe, her walking around free.</i>

24:58.580 --> 25:01.625
<i>She's dangerous, not just to me.</i>
<i>To your brother. To you.</i>

25:11.760 --> 25:13.929
<i>Night off. That works.</i>

25:19.351 --> 25:21.061
<i>Seems bunny's home.</i>

26:05.021 --> 26:09.109
<i>"Rope bondage." "Tight binding."</i>
<i>"Krav Maga"?</i>

26:17.200 --> 26:18.076
Candace!

26:19.578 --> 26:22.789
Untie me, you... bitch!

26:22.998 --> 26:24.457
- I'm sorry,
-Oh!

26:24.541 --> 26:26.334
<i>-what</i> did you call me?
-Ah!

26:26.418 --> 26:27.961
<i> Not Candace. What?</i>

26:39.347 --> 26:40.390
Hi.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.184
I-- I just-- I...

26:43.268 --> 26:44.686
Just save your lies for the cops.

26:44.769 --> 26:47.606
No, this is--
this is not what it looks like.

26:47.689 --> 26:48.732
Oh, really?

26:50.317 --> 26:51.568
Candace Stone?

26:53.862 --> 26:57.157
You're not a film financier.
You're a waitress, barely.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.910
Spent a good few weeks
in a mental hospital last year.

27:01.411 --> 27:05.415
You have no money, no family,
no permanent address.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.084
And so you tried to con us.

27:08.168 --> 27:11.421
-Wouldn't be the first time.
-Love, okay, please--

27:11.504 --> 27:14.215
The one thing I still don't understand
is what you want with Will.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.594
His name's not Will.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.556
-Jesus Christ, what--
-It's Joe Goldberg.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.226
He's my ex-boyfriend.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.688
I know this sounds crazy,
but I am telling you the truth.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.983
He attacked me and almost killed me.

27:32.067 --> 27:35.278
-He what?
-Yes. And he killed the girl after me.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.823
Is this some kind of joke?

27:39.240 --> 27:40.825
I-- I wish it was.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.912
I only came here to protect you.

27:45.121 --> 27:47.874
Before you went to Austin
to date my brother or after?

27:47.957 --> 27:49.751
No, to protect all of you.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.712
But especially you.

27:54.464 --> 27:55.507
If he loves you,

27:56.591 --> 27:59.636
that's the most dangerous thing.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.229
Take a look inside.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.779
Now, bitch, what's your name?

28:19.030 --> 28:19.906
Will.

28:20.907 --> 28:22.492
Why did you break into my home, Will?

28:22.575 --> 28:23.410
I didn't break in.

28:23.993 --> 28:26.162
-I was just--
-Don't lie to me.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.789
I learnt Krav Maga.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.667
And I'm not afraid to use it.

28:30.959 --> 28:34.129
<i>I’ve made mistakes, but, oh my,</i>
<i>is this a new first prize?</i>

28:34.212 --> 28:35.296
The door was open.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.216
Is an open door the same
as an invitation to enter?

28:39.217 --> 28:41.094
I'm sorry.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.805
-I asked you a question.
-Please.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.765
Come on, Will. Consent 101.

28:45.849 --> 28:49.436
Is an open door the same
as an invitation to enter?

28:49.519 --> 28:51.563
No, no. No, it's not.

28:51.646 --> 28:53.940
<i>Who knows</i>
<i>how to tie people up like this?</i>

28:54.023 --> 28:56.985
<i>This woman is clearly</i>
<i>some kind of perverted sex worker.</i>

28:57.068 --> 28:58.945
<i>Not that I'm judging.</i>

28:59.362 --> 29:00.780
<i>-Think.</i>
- Think.

29:00.864 --> 29:01.781
Who's Candace?

29:03.324 --> 29:06.995
Amy... Adam. That's why I'm here.

29:07.078 --> 29:07.912
I see.

29:09.622 --> 29:11.791
And you were going to...

29:11.916 --> 29:14.002
That's... that's...

29:14.169 --> 29:15.837
That's not what it looks like.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.506
I was supposed to creep in
and surprise her.

29:20.341 --> 29:23.678
In bed. She wanted me to tie her up.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.806
-And, you know, it-- This is--
-You're telling me

29:26.890 --> 29:29.017
this is some kind of scene you negotiated?

29:29.100 --> 29:30.894
We're both really vanilla, I admit.

29:30.977 --> 29:33.938
But she keeps asking,
and I wanna be more GGG.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.940
This is not the first time
she has flaked on me.

29:36.024 --> 29:40.987
This is the first time I have been beaten
and tied up for it, though.

29:43.698 --> 29:46.409
Jesus. You poor, pathetic boy.
You went to Home Depot.

29:46.826 --> 29:48.495
Can I give you a piece of advice?

29:48.995 --> 29:51.539
Um, maybe untie me first?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.958
Don't try so hard. This isn't you.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.544
You're not rape fantasy guy.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.172
I'm not.
Not even a little bit.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.841
You're demeaning yourself, man.
Let me tell you something about Amy.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.760
She's hardly been here
since she rented my room.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.304
-I can hardly feel my hands.
-I know the type.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.473
Come to LA with stars in their eyes,

30:08.556 --> 30:10.892
but few, if any,
have the talent to make it.

30:11.392 --> 30:12.644
So they starfuck.

30:13.686 --> 30:18.191
You know, she's dating some douche-canoe
with a <i>stupid</i> name.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.777
Forbes? Francis?

30:21.319 --> 30:22.779
Idiot.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.239
Mm-hmm.

30:24.697 --> 30:28.660
A lot of men in LA should just be taken
out of the gene pool.

30:28.743 --> 30:31.496
<i>Murdered by an unhinged dominatrix.</i>

30:31.871 --> 30:32.831
<i>Remember me, Love.</i>

30:32.914 --> 30:34.707
I'm inclined to untie you.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.710
But you try anything stupid,

30:37.794 --> 30:39.963
and I throat punch you
with my Louboutin, dig?

30:40.046 --> 30:40.880
Yes.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.132
Yes, I dig. I dig.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.474
Ah.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.271
Call yourself a Lyft, sweetie,
and get the fuck out of my house.

30:57.564 --> 31:01.192
<i>Candace two, me zero. Damn it.</i>

31:14.330 --> 31:15.373
It smells amazing.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.041
It's a new recipe.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.253
Taste?

31:50.074 --> 31:51.743
That-- It tastes--

31:51.826 --> 31:52.702
Like shit?

31:55.830 --> 31:58.583
- I'm sorry. It's-- it's salty.
-Yeah.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.543
It's 'cause I used salt instead of sugar.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.629
Sucks being lied to, huh?

32:09.385 --> 32:10.219
What is this?

32:11.304 --> 32:12.263
Open it.

32:21.397 --> 32:22.649
<i>Truth time.</i>

32:24.025 --> 32:25.360
Tell me it isn't you.

32:25.944 --> 32:26.819
It's me.

32:29.697 --> 32:31.324
Is your name Will Bettelheim?

32:32.325 --> 32:33.493
My name is Joe.

32:36.245 --> 32:37.497
Joe Goldberg.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.589
-And Amy--
-Is Candace Stone. I know. I--

32:47.757 --> 32:50.009
Why did she tell me
that you buried her alive?

32:50.093 --> 32:53.054
-That's what she believes.
-Yeah, well, she also believes...

32:53.721 --> 32:57.225
that you killed a woman,
and that you're basically Dexter.

32:57.308 --> 32:58.810
Candace Stone is crazy.

32:59.018 --> 32:59.978
Clearly!

33:01.020 --> 33:04.273
But there also must be some grain of truth
because you look so pale right now.

33:05.316 --> 33:06.275
So just tell me.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.361
I can find out.

33:10.405 --> 33:11.990
Anything. Right?

33:15.201 --> 33:16.452
Unlimited resources.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.959
Okay. Can--

33:25.503 --> 33:28.506
Candace is the reason I left New York.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.466
She's obsessed with me.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.554
She destroyed friendships, relationships.

33:35.596 --> 33:37.932
-I had to leave my job.
-Okay.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.767
Say you're right. She's nuts.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.312
What about the other girl?

33:44.147 --> 33:49.318
Guinevere Beck.
<i>The Dark Face of Love</i> herself.

33:50.236 --> 33:52.864
Yeah, that was tragic.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.783
But we went out on one date.

33:56.409 --> 33:57.452
My main takeaway

33:57.535 --> 34:01.748
is she posted a photo of us
to make her actual boyfriend jealous.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.292
I never saw her,

34:04.375 --> 34:06.002
until months later
I heard she passed away.

34:06.085 --> 34:09.297
You tell me how Candace knows
about that at all.

34:10.298 --> 34:11.966
Why do you think I had no social media?

34:12.508 --> 34:13.885
Why do you think I changed my name?

34:13.968 --> 34:16.554
I wanted to disappear,
and she followed me.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.308
I just wanted to be free.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.728
And then I met you.

34:26.064 --> 34:29.067
Love, I am so sorry I lied.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.693
Why didn’t you tell me...

34:32.070 --> 34:34.322
the moment that she showed up with Forty?

34:38.493 --> 34:39.744
I was terrified.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.537
Well, I sent her away.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.624
With a few threats, a lot of money.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.169
So she’s gone for real.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.963
But <i>fuck,</i> Will.

34:54.008 --> 34:54.967
Joe?

34:56.344 --> 34:58.971
I don't even know
what I'm supposed to call you now.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.807
Call me whatever you want.

35:01.724 --> 35:04.227
Call me Will. You can call me Joe.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.687
You can call me that fucking liar.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.397
Call me in the middle of the night.

35:08.481 --> 35:12.318
Call me happy, sad, sick,

35:13.277 --> 35:14.278
for favors,

35:15.404 --> 35:17.740
for sex, for a laugh,

35:19.242 --> 35:20.326
a cry...

35:22.286 --> 35:25.540
Don’t ever stop calling me.

35:26.499 --> 35:29.377
I have never loved anyone
like this before.

35:33.756 --> 35:35.007
Me neither.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.479
Which is what makes this so hard.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.533
It's over.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.686
How long have you um...

36:30.771 --> 36:32.231
How long have you known?

36:35.943 --> 36:39.447
You’ve been keeping this from me
for two <i>months?</i>

36:42.074 --> 36:43.326
You lied.

36:47.121 --> 36:47.997
Why?

36:53.336 --> 36:54.295
How am I...?

37:34.543 --> 37:37.088
You can't. You can't. You can't.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.259
You can't be sick.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.072
<i> It would be easy</i>
<i>to blame Candace for this, </i>

38:03.155 --> 38:06.242
<i>and I do, but I blame myself too.</i>

38:06.826 --> 38:08.202
<i>I broke my own rule.</i>

38:08.786 --> 38:10.746
<i>But what is life without Love?</i>

38:14.166 --> 38:16.252
<i>I guess I'm gonna find out.</i>

38:16.335 --> 38:20.006
Well, if it isn’t Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Douchebag.

38:23.092 --> 38:26.512
I came by to drop off my badge
and my apron.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.140
You don’t have to quit.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.600
I do, Forty.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.520
Actually... you don't.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.231
Look, Love told me everything,

38:37.315 --> 38:41.235
and while we agreed
that you are a lying ball sack,

38:41.944 --> 38:43.070
we also agreed

38:43.154 --> 38:45.740
that you probably don’t need
to be punished twice.

38:45.823 --> 38:51.120
So just, like, stay out of her airspace
for a while. Okay?

38:51.954 --> 38:53.456
Are you saying I should stay?

38:55.207 --> 38:56.167
For now.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.295
I went to bat for you.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.048
Why?

39:02.757 --> 39:05.301
Because it's nice having you around.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.011
You’re real.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.724
You did lie about your identity,

39:11.807 --> 39:14.977
but you are still more authentic

39:15.061 --> 39:17.104
than half the fuckers I know.

39:18.689 --> 39:19.607
Thanks, man.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.443
<i> If being Forty’s bitch</i>
<i>means I get to stay in your orbit,</i>

39:22.526 --> 39:23.986
<i>sign me up.</i>

39:24.070 --> 39:25.946
<i>Like I said, he’s not a bad guy.</i>

39:26.030 --> 39:29.116
You’re not one
of those self-loathing Jews, are you?

39:29.200 --> 39:30.701
-<i> Spoke too soon.</i>
-What?

39:30.785 --> 39:31.994
Joe Goldberg.

39:32.411 --> 39:34.080
Great name for a producer.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.164
Will Bettelheim...

39:36.332 --> 39:38.876
made you sound like a Nazi, so...

39:40.211 --> 39:42.171
Thank you for giving me another chance.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.131
And thank Love for me, too.

39:45.508 --> 39:46.884
Land of second chances, am I right?

39:50.971 --> 39:52.056
<i> This can work.</i>

39:52.890 --> 39:54.934
<i>I’ll just go back to loving you</i>
<i>from a distance.</i>

39:56.644 --> 40:00.773
<i>Life’s a divine comedy.</i>
<i>A tale told by an idiot.</i>

40:01.732 --> 40:03.567
<i>-A sadistic idiot.</i>

40:04.026 --> 40:05.069
<i>Speaking of sadists,</i>

40:05.152 --> 40:06.946
<i>I’d endure a ten-hour session with Rachel</i>

40:07.029 --> 40:09.365
<i>for just five more minutes</i>
<i>of you not hating me.</i>

40:09.657 --> 40:12.118
-Please do something.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.126
Hey, Delilah?

40:20.918 --> 40:22.002
What?

40:22.336 --> 40:23.963
<i> It’s worse than I thought.</i>

40:27.550 --> 40:28.467
How’s it going?

40:29.176 --> 40:31.971
Hmm. How's it going? Um...

40:32.096 --> 40:34.849
This town enables rapists.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.227
You mind if I take a look?

40:46.694 --> 40:48.904
Wow. This is quite a who’s who.

40:49.363 --> 40:50.281
Oh!

40:50.656 --> 40:51.991
Oh, look, I made the cut.

40:52.074 --> 40:53.993
Don’t touch, please. Don't touch.

40:54.076 --> 40:56.620
<i>I’d be worried,</i>
<i>but half of Hollywood is up there,</i>

40:56.704 --> 40:57.955
<i>including Johnny Carson,</i>

40:58.038 --> 40:59.832
<i>who I’m pretty sure has been dead</i>
<i>for years.</i>

41:02.126 --> 41:03.210
This is a lot, Delilah.

41:05.004 --> 41:07.131
You don't think I know that?

41:07.798 --> 41:10.384
I’m trying to topple the patriarchy

41:10.468 --> 41:11.802
from my two-bedroom apartment,

41:11.886 --> 41:15.639
and it is, one, impossible,
and, two, deranged,

41:15.723 --> 41:18.851
and I just...
I just want somebody to hurt...

41:20.102 --> 41:21.187
like I'm hurting.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.400
Is-- Is this okay?

41:26.901 --> 41:31.906
Oh, look at you, asking for consent,
very fucking woke. Gold star.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.576
I’m sorry he hurt you.

41:42.124 --> 41:45.002
<i> Palo santo and synthetic watermelon.</i>

41:45.085 --> 41:49.340
<i>Odd combo, but it works.</i>
<i>Wise and irreverent, like her.</i>

41:51.884 --> 41:52.801
Will...

41:57.139 --> 41:59.517
<i> She’s not in her right mind,</i>
<i>and neither am I.</i>

41:59.600 --> 42:00.643
<i>This is bad.</i>

42:00.726 --> 42:02.186
<i>So why doesn’t it feel bad?</i>

42:02.269 --> 42:05.147
Okay, wait.  You're upset.
Maybe we shouldn’t...

42:06.357 --> 42:08.150
I just want to feel good again.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.110
<i> Me too.</i>

42:19.912 --> 42:21.080
<i> She needed someone.</i>

42:22.456 --> 42:24.083
<i>I suppose it's the least I could do.</i>

42:24.166 --> 42:27.253
This whole thing that you're doing--

42:27.336 --> 42:28.462
Is a lot.

42:28.546 --> 42:33.092
And I have ten unpleasant phone calls
I need to get to, so...

42:33.968 --> 42:35.803
-Maybe you should just go.
-Yeah, okay...

42:35.886 --> 42:37.763
So, I have a thought about<i> </i>that.

42:38.472 --> 42:39.431
Oh?

42:40.516 --> 42:41.684
Chasing this story...

42:43.561 --> 42:46.564
You know the story already.
It's... it's your story.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.234
-Are you saying...?
-I'm saying...

42:50.693 --> 42:53.654
you go after the whole town
if you want,

42:54.697 --> 42:58.742
but what if you tell your story?
Think about how powerful that would be.

42:59.785 --> 43:03.497
It might encourage others to do the same.
You wouldn’t have to chase them down.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.792
They would follow your example
and come forward.

43:08.919 --> 43:14.258
Did you just mansplain
<i>and </i>patronize me in the same sentence?

43:15.050 --> 43:17.428
Thanks for the D, Will. Bye.

43:27.146 --> 43:29.064
<i>I gotta get out of this town, Love.</i>

43:34.361 --> 43:35.988
Can you believe this?

43:39.033 --> 43:40.242
<i> Seven totems.</i>

43:40.326 --> 43:43.078
And once you find all of them,
you are officially an Angeleno.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.623
...and can never leave.

43:46.540 --> 43:49.251
<i> Starlets in matching dresses.</i>
<i>Dog in a stroller.</i>

43:49.335 --> 43:52.463
<i>Off-brand superhero.</i>
<i>Rollerblader in booty-shorts. Cop chopper.</i>

43:52.546 --> 43:53.547
<i>Pack of coyotes.</i>

43:54.590 --> 43:57.217
<i>And the burning palm tree.</i>

43:58.510 --> 43:59.887
<i>As Raymond Chandler said,</i>

44:00.596 --> 44:04.183
<i>"There is no trap so deadly</i>
<i>as the trap you set for yourself."</i>

44:05.309 --> 44:07.811
<i>Maybe I’ll stick around for a while,</i>
<i>push my luck.</i>

44:08.479 --> 44:09.605
<i>One thing’s for sure,</i>

44:10.439 --> 44:11.774
<i>you can’t beat the donuts.</i>
