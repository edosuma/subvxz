Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.080 --> 00:06.380
Obviously, I had to be here

00:06.380 --> 00:08.120
when you tried out
for the Ultimate elite team.

00:08.120 --> 00:10.080
That's not a team.
That's a platoon.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.420
You don't have to do this.

00:11.420 --> 00:13.710
You're still
gonna be Jonah Beck.
You're gonna be okay.

00:13.710 --> 00:17.290
-I'm not gonna make the team.
-You're gonna make the team.

00:17.290 --> 00:19.960
No. No, no, no.
There must've been
some mistake.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.080
That coach is a fool
and a buffoon.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.830
It's okay.
It gives me a goal,

00:23.830 --> 00:25.830
something to work towards.

00:25.830 --> 00:30.080
Once we decided to redesign
The Fringe, the ideas
just kept coming.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.750
I need to feel I can speak up
if I don't like your ideas.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.330
What do you think
about the name Cloud Nine?

00:34.330 --> 00:36.710
I think I don't understand
why it's not Cloud Ten.

00:36.710 --> 00:38.120
-Cloud Ten!
-I love it!

00:38.120 --> 00:39.500
(shrieks)

00:39.500 --> 00:40.580
Bowie:
So Morgan did steal
the prayer box.

00:40.580 --> 00:42.210
And you knew she stole it?

00:42.210 --> 00:43.960
You made it look like
it was all Andi's fault!

00:43.960 --> 00:45.710
You made me doubt
my own daughter.

00:45.710 --> 00:48.460
And even worse,
you made Andi doubt herself.

00:48.460 --> 00:50.380
So, um, you and Miranda?

00:50.380 --> 00:52.750
She's out of my life forever.

00:58.380 --> 00:59.420
(sighs)

00:59.420 --> 01:01.250
-Bex!
-(moans)

01:02.750 --> 01:06.500
You in danger?
Anything on fire?

01:06.500 --> 01:09.170
Um... no.

01:09.170 --> 01:12.040
Then to what do I owe
the torture?

01:12.040 --> 01:14.330
(sighs)
I made you coffee.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.000
Why?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.330
Because I thought
it was time

01:21.330 --> 01:23.420
I finally learned
how to make coffee.

01:23.420 --> 01:26.920
You just...
taught yourself?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.540
Yeah, I used
my super powers

01:28.540 --> 01:31.120
of reading
and following
directions.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.380
Taste it.

01:38.380 --> 01:40.460
-Mmm!
-Really?

01:40.460 --> 01:41.500
Mmm-hmm.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.580
I'm gonna make you coffee
every morning.

01:43.580 --> 01:45.460
Aw, you don't have
to do that.

01:45.460 --> 01:48.000
Well, I know how much
you hate to get out of bed

01:48.000 --> 01:50.620
and make coffee,
so now you won't have to.

01:50.620 --> 01:53.120
You're the best daughter
in the world.

01:57.580 --> 01:58.880
Sorry, plant.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.460
I'm gonna try
making eggs now.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.500
I hope you like eggs.

What kind of notebook is that?

03:11.580 --> 03:13.040
It's a philo-stax.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.040
It's a calendar,
and an organizer,

03:16.040 --> 03:17.880
and I have a ruler...

03:17.880 --> 03:20.710
and a laminated map
of the London subway!

03:20.710 --> 03:23.040
It was my dad's,
but he never used it.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.120
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.290
Let me take a picture of it

03:26.290 --> 03:28.670
with my philo-stax.

03:28.670 --> 03:30.380
Laugh it up, Millennial.

03:30.380 --> 03:31.380
(laughs)

03:32.500 --> 03:35.830
Whoa! That thing is from 1990.

03:35.830 --> 03:39.670
1990 has the exact same days
and dates as 2018.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.540
How do you know that?

03:41.540 --> 03:42.830
I looked it up on the Internet.

03:42.830 --> 03:46.080
Oh, and, uh, how did you
look on the Internet?

03:46.080 --> 03:48.040
Not taking any more questions.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.380
Your lunch is served.

03:50.380 --> 03:53.330
Cyrus and... you.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.790
Wow, look at that.

03:54.790 --> 03:56.460
You got our order right,

03:56.460 --> 03:58.000
and everything's hot.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.250
Turns out practice
makes... decent.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.580
Well, I couldn't even balance
two plates at one time,

04:03.580 --> 04:05.040
so I'm impressed.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.170
(laughs)

04:10.670 --> 04:12.170
You're doing it again.

04:12.170 --> 04:13.380
What am I doing?

04:13.380 --> 04:17.120
First it was TJ,
and now it's Amber.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.580
Why do you have this need
to be friendly with...

04:20.580 --> 04:21.920
unfriendly people?

04:21.920 --> 04:23.710
You know, from Amber's
point of view,

04:23.710 --> 04:24.670
you're the unfriendly one.

04:24.670 --> 04:29.380
Okay, so she's unfriendly
and a bad judge of character.

04:29.380 --> 04:31.620
I know you don't like Amber.

04:31.620 --> 04:35.580
But it's unhealthy to hold on
to so much animosity.

04:35.580 --> 04:38.080
Or should we call it
Amber-mosity?

04:38.080 --> 04:40.500
-Huh?
-No.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.670
Welcome to Cloud 10.

04:47.670 --> 04:48.790
Welcome to Cloud 10.

04:48.790 --> 04:51.620
It's your go-to spot
for beauty booty!

04:53.000 --> 04:55.830
Your go-to spot for...
dream creams?

04:55.830 --> 04:57.540
That's worse.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.750
You do makeovers
here, right?

05:03.750 --> 05:07.420
Yes! We will, but we're not
officially open yet,

05:07.420 --> 05:08.750
so come back
in two weeks.

05:08.750 --> 05:12.620
It's your go-to spot
for your no-good spots!

05:12.620 --> 05:15.040
No, wait, wait... (sighs)

05:15.040 --> 05:18.620
Mmm, hmm.
Here's an idea.

05:18.620 --> 05:22.420
Why don't you hand out
some free samples?

05:22.420 --> 05:24.210
Well, Mom's already
doin' that.

05:24.210 --> 05:28.380
Andi (sighs): She's not
doing much of anything.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.790
Except missing Pops.

05:29.790 --> 05:32.790
I wish there was some way
we could snap her out of it.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.880
Hey! Welcome to Cloud 10.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.790
This place looks great.

05:36.790 --> 05:39.620
-This is beautiful.
-Not so fast,
plant murderer.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.460
This one's going
to a safe place.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.210
Celia?

05:48.080 --> 05:49.460
Is that for me?

05:49.460 --> 05:53.080
Uh, who else
would I be giving
a sapphire orchid to?

05:53.080 --> 05:54.920
Look at what you created!

05:56.080 --> 05:59.620
Cloud 10,
where beauty begins.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.710
And that's how it's done.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.670
-You're coming with me.
-Okay.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.830
-Welcome to Cloud 10.
-Where beauty begins.

06:09.830 --> 06:10.880
Ooh!

06:10.880 --> 06:12.670
Welcome to Cloud 10,
where beauty begins.

06:12.670 --> 06:16.880
So you'll want a primer,
and this will get your skin
super soft,

06:16.880 --> 06:18.790
and it'll just feel
just like a baby's skin.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.960
Sure, yeah.
Spa water?

06:20.960 --> 06:22.830
It says Cloud 10.
(giggles)

06:22.830 --> 06:27.380
Buffy, what do you think?
Faux-hawk or no-hawk?

06:27.380 --> 06:28.620
Just hawk.

06:33.620 --> 06:36.120
-Selfie?
-Of course.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.880
(laughing)

06:42.960 --> 06:44.790
Hey, do you like trampolines?

06:44.790 --> 06:46.920
No, they're the worst.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.170
Of course I like trampolines!

06:49.170 --> 06:51.880
Did you know
there's an entire building

06:51.880 --> 06:53.540
that is nothing
but trampolines?

06:53.540 --> 06:56.120
I have heard tell
of this magical place.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.380
Do you wanna go?

06:58.380 --> 06:59.920
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah!

06:59.920 --> 07:02.920
-Great!
-(both laugh)

07:02.920 --> 07:04.380
Come back for a free makeover,

07:04.380 --> 07:07.960
'cause remember, Cloud 10,
make over, not under.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.000
So have you heard from Ham?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.500
He sent me
a Tibetan singing bowl.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.710
That's nice.

07:14.710 --> 07:17.290
You obviously have never heard
a Tibetan bowl sing.

07:17.290 --> 07:19.540
(piercing ring)

07:21.250 --> 07:22.670
Oh. Excuse me.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.920
Jonah's taking me
to the trampoline park tomorrow.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.170
Will this be
your first real date?

07:30.880 --> 07:33.040
-It's starting.
-What is?

07:33.040 --> 07:36.380
You know,
the fun couple stuff.

07:36.380 --> 07:39.880
You start saving ticket stubs
and passing notes in class.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.040
You mean texting.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.790
Sure. And then, there are
those late night calls

07:43.790 --> 07:45.250
that go way too long
in the night.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.790
Again, texting.

07:46.790 --> 07:48.790
And I have to come in and say,
"Andi, put your phone away,

07:48.790 --> 07:50.750
you've got school
in the morning."

07:50.750 --> 07:52.710
And you pretend to hang up,
but you don't.

07:52.710 --> 07:54.920
Oh, gosh,
those are the best.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.830
Hmm.
Oh, hey!

07:56.830 --> 07:59.540
Andi's going
on her first real date
with Jonah tomorrow.

07:59.540 --> 08:02.960
Okay. Uh...(chuckles)
We don't have to tell
everybody.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.170
But I'm your father!
I have to be there
when he picks you up!

08:06.170 --> 08:07.880
And I have to do this...

08:07.880 --> 08:09.250
(clears throat)

08:09.250 --> 08:10.880
No, you don't.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.040
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.500
(clears throat)

08:19.000 --> 08:20.500
I need a picture!

08:22.880 --> 08:25.500
Okay.
We're leaving now.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.710
Wait.
I have some questions
for the young man.

08:27.710 --> 08:28.790
Bye!

08:31.380 --> 08:33.960
I can't remember.
Did your parents put us
through this

08:33.960 --> 08:35.080
when I picked you up
on our first date?

08:35.080 --> 08:37.790
No. 'Cause I climbed
out the window.

08:37.790 --> 08:39.290
(laughs)

08:39.290 --> 08:41.830
Text me when they get back?
I wanna know how it went.

08:41.830 --> 08:45.210
Do you have to go?
We could hang out,
have lunch.

08:45.210 --> 08:47.670
-I am hungry.
-I'm starving!

08:47.670 --> 08:48.920
-Should we go out?
-Sure.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.000
Or we could stay here,
and one of us could make lunch.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.040
-That sounds good.
-And if one of us did that,

08:54.040 --> 08:57.000
the other one of us
would be thrilled.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.420
Can we start using names?

08:58.420 --> 09:00.920
-Bowie, I want lunch.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.540
Then how are you
so good at everything?

09:54.540 --> 09:56.290
Oh, everyone's good
at trampolining.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.170
It's just falling with style.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.500
You're really the coolest girl

Oh, I'm really enjoying
all the compliments,

10:04.040 --> 10:06.920
but maybe you should save some
for our second date?

10:06.920 --> 10:10.210
I was thinking,
Adrenaline City
next weekend?

10:10.210 --> 10:11.880
I hear they have
a new roller coaster.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.620
I can't next weekend.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.750
Oh. Okay.
Weekend after that?

10:15.750 --> 10:17.500
Andi...

10:17.500 --> 10:21.250
Oh, no.
I was having so much fun.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.750
I'm going to camp.

10:23.750 --> 10:27.040
Processing... processing.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.620
So, you're going to camp.

10:29.620 --> 10:31.670
-For how long?
-For eight weeks.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.540
Processing.

10:37.540 --> 10:38.920
Processing.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.420
(sighs) When do you leave?

10:45.620 --> 10:47.000
Tomorrow.

10:49.670 --> 10:51.000
Tomorrow.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.170
Where are you going?

10:59.170 --> 11:01.620
I-- I need to process this
on solid ground.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.120
When did you decide to go?

11:12.120 --> 11:13.750
A few days ago.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.080
I tried out
for an Ultimate team
in a regional league,

11:16.080 --> 11:18.540
but... I didn't make it.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.120
I'm so sorry.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.830
Yeah, it felt pretty bad.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.120
Then I heard
about this Ultimate camp,

11:25.120 --> 11:27.330
and I thought if I spent
some time working
on my game,

11:27.330 --> 11:29.960
I could try out again
next season.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.460
That makes sense.

11:31.460 --> 11:33.880
I get it. I... I do.

11:35.330 --> 11:37.080
I'm just a little sad.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.620
Me too.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.920
Cyrus, you in here?

11:50.040 --> 11:51.420
Cyrus?

11:56.290 --> 11:58.960
(scoffs)
What are you doing?

11:58.960 --> 12:00.420
You don't remember?

12:00.420 --> 12:03.120
-Apparently not.
-Think hard.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.420
I remember what happened
that last time we were
in your dad's office.

12:06.420 --> 12:09.500
You made me play that toxic game
that shall not be named.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.250
Relax.
No board games today.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.880
Oh, are we playing that game
we used to play?

12:14.880 --> 12:19.250
The one where make up
crazy fake phobias,
like yours about puppets?

12:19.250 --> 12:22.830
That's real, and it's gonna
save my life someday.

12:22.830 --> 12:25.000
(scoffs)
I'm in. Let's play.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Okay.
But I should warn you.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.790
In this version,
there's a twist.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.420
I'll go first.

12:31.420 --> 12:33.580
My phobia is...

12:40.250 --> 12:44.000
being trapped
in a small space
with that.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.170
(sighs)

12:46.170 --> 12:49.580
Welcome... twist.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.120
(TV playing indistinctly)

12:55.170 --> 12:59.000
-What just happened?
-There's a third time line.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.080
How many places
can a wormhole go?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.120
There's in
and there's out.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.670
I wish there was some way

13:03.670 --> 13:05.540
we could find out
what happens next.

13:05.540 --> 13:08.330
-Okay!
One more episode.
-Yes.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.670
And, yes,
I realize I've said that
four times already.

13:11.670 --> 13:14.250
Nice! It's a long episode.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.250
(sighs)
I love long episodes.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.290
Is that spot taken?

13:20.290 --> 13:22.080
That spot?

13:23.830 --> 13:25.250
It's a hot ticket.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.880
There's a wait list.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.290
Mmm... if only
I'd booked sooner.

13:29.290 --> 13:32.170
Mm. I could pull
some strings.

13:34.620 --> 13:36.120
Bring it in.

13:42.170 --> 13:43.330
Ready?

13:44.460 --> 13:45.920
Ready.

13:55.170 --> 13:56.790
You sure
I can't take you home?

13:58.120 --> 13:59.120
No.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.670
This is where I need to be.

14:03.670 --> 14:07.210
Can I at least
walk you to the door?

14:07.210 --> 14:08.290
Sure.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.250
(sighs)

14:18.420 --> 14:19.960
I'll be back.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.210
I know.

14:22.250 --> 14:25.250
I just can't help
being disappointed

14:25.250 --> 14:29.380
that now that we're
in the same place...

14:29.380 --> 14:31.380
we're not gonna be
in the same place.

14:31.380 --> 14:33.120
I'm gonna miss you.

14:34.920 --> 14:37.120
But it's all gonna work out.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.040
Maybe it will.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.250
Bye, Andiman.

14:54.540 --> 14:56.580
Goodbye, Jonah Beck.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.040
CeCe. Hi.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.000
This is a... nice surprise.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.830
You don't mind, do you?

15:40.830 --> 15:44.460
AndiShack is so much cozier
than... Castle Mack.

15:44.460 --> 15:47.960
Especially now that the queen is
the only one in residence.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.290
Of course I don't mind.

15:55.290 --> 15:58.380
Oh, Andi, there's
no need to worry.

15:58.380 --> 16:02.460
I'm just having a little trouble
sleeping since Pops left.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.960
I get that.

16:03.960 --> 16:08.500
In fact, I don't think
I'm gonna sleep very well
either tonight.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.710
Because Jonah's leaving.

16:11.710 --> 16:14.880
Oh, uh, this shack
is not soundproof.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.080
Clearly.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.210
He'll be back
before you know it.

16:19.210 --> 16:22.000
It'll be like
he never left.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.620
I could say the same thing
about you and Pops.

16:26.920 --> 16:31.920
But until he gets back,
AndiShack can be your cozy
home away from home.

16:46.420 --> 16:49.080
Amber... Buffy.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.620
Thank you both for coming.

16:50.620 --> 16:53.460
-I was tricked into this.
-I didn't know she'd be here.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.290
Exactly why are we here?

16:55.290 --> 16:58.290
I think I can help you two
find a way to be friends.

16:58.290 --> 17:00.000
-Not gonna happen.
-You've gotta be kidding!

17:00.000 --> 17:03.210
Let's at least try
to keep an open mind here.

17:03.210 --> 17:04.380
Who'd like to start?

17:08.420 --> 17:11.040
Great. Buffy,
why don't you tell us

17:11.040 --> 17:13.250
why you think the two of you
don't get along?

17:13.250 --> 17:16.330
(scoffs) Because...
she's Amber.

17:16.330 --> 17:20.290
Mm. Can you be more specific?

17:20.290 --> 17:22.920
She embarrassed my friend
at her party.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.710
She left her on top
of a Ferris wheel!

17:24.710 --> 17:27.170
This isn't about Andi.

17:27.170 --> 17:29.120
This is about you.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.540
What has Amber done to you?

17:31.540 --> 17:34.830
Yeah. What have
I ever done to you?

17:38.170 --> 17:40.960
I guess... nothing.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.460
So I win!

17:42.460 --> 17:44.380
Do I win?

17:44.380 --> 17:47.420
Amber, what is it
you have against Buffy?

17:48.420 --> 17:49.830
She doesn't like me.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.960
Hmm. And if that
weren't the case,

17:51.960 --> 17:53.540
what would you have
against her?

17:56.420 --> 17:58.960
I guess... nothing.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.290
So, it seems that your dislike
for each other

18:02.290 --> 18:05.170
is the only thing
keeping you disliking
each other.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.620
I should write that down.
Where's my philo-stax?

18:10.620 --> 18:13.420
What is that?
Did he lose his phone?

18:13.420 --> 18:17.420
No, he just wants
a bigger and slower way
of keeping track of things.

18:17.420 --> 18:19.710
-He's kinda quirky.
-He's only quirky.

18:19.710 --> 18:22.580
Okay, this breakthrough's
getting off-track.

18:22.580 --> 18:25.420
Can I pencil you in
for another session?

18:25.420 --> 18:28.580
Both:
Pencil! (laughing)

18:28.580 --> 18:30.830
(TV playing indistinctly)

18:37.580 --> 18:40.040
(whispers)
Bex.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.750
Bex?

18:41.750 --> 18:44.250
I can't feel my leg.

19:07.170 --> 19:08.170
(TV stops)

19:11.750 --> 19:13.330
Bex.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.420
(whispers)
Bex.

19:21.330 --> 19:22.580
Bex...

19:29.500 --> 19:30.750
I love you.

19:46.170 --> 19:47.420
(sighs)

19:52.880 --> 19:56.120
(stomps feet)

20:35.290 --> 20:37.670
Andi:
And thus ended my date.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.540
My best, worst,
only and first.

20:41.540 --> 20:45.120
My relationship with Jonah
is a Dr. Seuss book.

20:47.540 --> 20:53.540
Oh, and I found CeCe holed up
like a Lorax in AndiShack.

20:53.540 --> 20:54.830
What do you mean?

20:54.830 --> 20:59.250
I'm a little worried about her.
She seems lonely without Pops.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.170
He'll be back soon.

21:01.170 --> 21:02.670
We should spend
more time with her.

21:02.670 --> 21:05.790
Okay, but, also, we gotta do
more stuff together.

21:05.790 --> 21:09.290
I hear there's
a new roller coaster
at Adrenaline City.

21:09.290 --> 21:11.290
We could also go tubing.

21:11.290 --> 21:12.790
Oh, I'd love that!

21:12.790 --> 21:15.710
Or, I don't know,
I could marry Bowie.

21:15.710 --> 21:18.250
(snickers)
Before or after tubing?

21:18.250 --> 21:19.920
Did you hear
what I just said?

21:22.170 --> 21:24.540
Wait. You were serious?

21:29.500 --> 21:31.080
Say it again.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.670
I'm gonna marry Bowie.

21:33.670 --> 21:35.420
(screams)

21:35.420 --> 21:37.960
Wait. He asked you
without me?

21:37.960 --> 21:41.210
No! No, no.
I'm gonna ask him.

21:42.580 --> 21:46.920
You just said we were gonna do
more stuff together.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.790
What are you thinkin'?

21:48.790 --> 21:51.170
We are gonna ask him?

21:52.380 --> 21:56.380
Both:
Bee-yah, bee-yah, bee-yah,
bee-yah bee-yah...

21:56.380 --> 21:58.000
Starfish!

22:03.500 --> 22:04.670
Bex:
Next, on Andi Mack...

22:04.670 --> 22:05.830
I'm not rejoining the team.

22:05.830 --> 22:06.790
Cyrus:
Is this because of TJ?

22:06.790 --> 22:07.920
What do you care what I do?

22:07.920 --> 22:09.170
Well, 'cause you're good.

22:09.170 --> 22:11.580
-I mean, not as good as me.
-And you know that, how?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.500
Are you gonna play
some one-on-one or somethin'?

22:14.500 --> 22:15.960
That's one.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.420
Andi:
We have the ring!

22:17.420 --> 22:19.040
Andi:
We're proposing tonight!

22:19.040 --> 22:20.580
Bex:
We need a plan.
What's the plan?

22:20.580 --> 22:22.330
Andi:
I got it! I got the idea!

22:22.330 --> 22:24.710
Okay, but we have to keep it
very low-key.

22:24.710 --> 22:27.380
The most important thing,
is we can't let Bowie know
that we're up to something.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.460
-You two are up to something.
-Both: No, we're not.
