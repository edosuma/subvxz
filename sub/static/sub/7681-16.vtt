01:26.369 --> 01:29.913
Stepping into a pair of skis
and pointing them straight downhill

01:29.914 --> 01:33.984
may be as close as
you can get to flying...

01:34.544 --> 01:38.284
... without completely
leaving the ground.

01:46.556 --> 01:50.309
Every winter, millions of people
enjoy being out on the slopes.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.979
You might not think Pete Thornton
would be one of them.

01:53.980 --> 01:56.480
And you'd be right.

02:11.205 --> 02:12.748
Thanks a Iot.

02:12.749 --> 02:16.168
Well, Iooks Iike you're
getting the hang of this.

02:16.169 --> 02:18.753
You know, one of us needs
to have his head examined,

02:18.754 --> 02:20.213
and I'm sure it's not you.

02:20.214 --> 02:22.132
Admit it, you're having
the time of your Iife.

02:22.133 --> 02:25.468
Oh, sure. I Iove having
two pounds of snow in my pants.

02:25.469 --> 02:27.596
"Let's take a week off," you said,

02:27.597 --> 02:29.848
"go somewhere
where we don't know anyone."

02:29.849 --> 02:32.684
"Fine," I said, "what about Hawaii?"

02:32.685 --> 02:35.730
"Hawaii," you said, "is boring."

02:35.896 --> 02:38.773
Well, you know something?
I think I Iike boring.

02:38.774 --> 02:42.402
I would Iove right now
to be Iying on the beach, in the sun,

02:42.403 --> 02:45.864
drinking wonderful things
from a pineapple.

02:45.865 --> 02:49.435
- Grab on.
- No. I got down by myself,

02:49.535 --> 02:53.622
I'II get up by myself. See that?

03:04.341 --> 03:05.633
Jack, you there?

03:05.634 --> 03:07.885
Yeah, I'm in the parking Iot
with Mr. Leland.

03:07.886 --> 03:10.722
Hey, Iook, I've been following Phil
all over this mountain.

03:10.723 --> 03:13.599
- Did you check his room at the Iodge?
- Yeah, it was clean.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.351
He's gotta have that microfilm
on him.

03:15.352 --> 03:17.228
Ask him is Phil alone?

03:17.229 --> 03:19.897
Yeah, Mr. Leland would
Iike to know is Phil alone?

03:19.898 --> 03:22.734
Yeah, for the first time
since he Ieft the Iodge.

03:22.735 --> 03:26.612
But he's acting real nervous, Iike
he's expecting somebody any minute.

03:26.613 --> 03:29.240
Tell him, take Phil now
before he makes his contact.

03:29.241 --> 03:32.811
Tell him, make sure
he gets that film.

03:56.601 --> 03:59.937
You know, if you want to stay up here
the rest of the week, that's fine,

03:59.938 --> 04:01.897
but I think I'm gonna go home.

04:01.898 --> 04:04.150
I thought your house
was being fumigated.

04:04.151 --> 04:06.569
Well, it is.

04:06.570 --> 04:10.322
But if I'm gonna die anyway, I might
as well be comfortable when I go.

04:10.323 --> 04:12.833
Know what I mean? Look out!

04:12.951 --> 04:15.451
Look out!

04:20.458 --> 04:23.210
- Hey, I'm really sorry.
- You guys all right?

04:23.211 --> 04:26.839
- Yeah, I think so.
- I'm just a beginner.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.300
Oh, you too?

04:29.301 --> 04:31.051
Well.

04:31.052 --> 04:33.887
Phil just ran into a guy
in a red sweater and pants.

04:33.888 --> 04:35.389
Knocked him for a Ioop.

04:35.390 --> 04:37.141
There's another guy with him too.

04:37.142 --> 04:39.642
Give me that.

04:39.811 --> 04:41.603
I'm talking to you now.

04:41.604 --> 04:44.314
Listen, Phil is supposed
to be an expert skier.

04:44.315 --> 04:46.358
He don't run into guys by accident.

04:46.359 --> 04:48.694
You sure they're not the feds
he's supposed to meet?

04:48.695 --> 04:51.321
Hey, how can I tell
from here, Mr. Leland?

04:51.322 --> 04:53.657
You make sure
he doesn't pass that film.

04:53.658 --> 04:56.743
You get the film, or don't
come back down the mountain.

04:56.744 --> 04:58.829
Let me get these poles for you.

04:58.830 --> 05:01.330
Appreciate it.

05:01.958 --> 05:04.669
- My name's Phil.
- MacGyver.

05:04.836 --> 05:07.672
- This is Pete Thornton.
- Hi.

05:07.839 --> 05:11.969
- You guys staying here at the Iodge?
- Yeah.

05:12.343 --> 05:14.428
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

05:14.429 --> 05:17.597
Well, I think I've had
enough fun for one day.

05:17.598 --> 05:19.891
- Nice meeting you, Phil.
- Yeah, you too.

05:19.892 --> 05:22.519
I'm gonna take another run
down Red Eye.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.772
- Last run of the day.
- Well, be careful.

05:25.773 --> 05:29.484
I'II meet you at the midway house
and we'II...

05:29.485 --> 05:32.495
We'II have a toddy for the body.

05:57.805 --> 06:00.098
- Hello, Phil.
- Who are you?

06:00.099 --> 06:01.683
How do you know my name?

06:01.684 --> 06:05.562
We have a mutual friend.
Your former boss, Sam Leland?

06:05.563 --> 06:07.355
I don't know any Sam Leland.

06:07.356 --> 06:10.108
Well, you stole some microfilm
from his files.

06:10.109 --> 06:11.985
Now, he feels it's very ungrateful

06:11.986 --> 06:15.905
that you should want to spill everything
about his operation to the cops.

06:15.906 --> 06:17.782
I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:17.783 --> 06:20.243
Listen, snow's really great
over at Hooter's Run.

06:20.244 --> 06:22.203
You should try it.

06:22.204 --> 06:24.580
You Iook, hairball.

06:24.581 --> 06:28.251
Two days ago I was in FIorida,
twinkling my toes in the sand.

06:28.252 --> 06:31.087
I get a call, I gotta come up here
and play snow bunny with you.

06:31.088 --> 06:35.628
I'm cold and I'm wet,
and I want that film now!

06:52.609 --> 06:56.195
There's something special
about the last run of the day.

06:56.196 --> 06:57.905
The slopes aren't so crowded,

06:57.906 --> 07:00.282
the shadows are longer,

07:00.283 --> 07:03.745
and it's sort of peaceful out there.

07:46.162 --> 07:48.872
Mr. Leland? Hey, Iook, I got Phil.

07:48.873 --> 07:50.916
He ain't got no film on him.

07:50.917 --> 07:53.417
It's gotta be on him.

07:53.837 --> 07:57.172
That guy in the red sweater,
did he give it to him?

07:57.173 --> 07:59.884
Look, I'm telling you, he--

08:01.844 --> 08:04.344
Oh, my God.

08:07.475 --> 08:11.396
Arnie, did he pass off
that film? Arnie?

08:11.562 --> 08:13.605
- What's with him?
- Let me try.

08:13.606 --> 08:16.024
Arnie, talk to me.

08:16.025 --> 08:18.525
Arnie, get back to me.

08:36.128 --> 08:38.628
Give me the binocs.

08:40.299 --> 08:46.329
- How do you-- ? How do you do this?
- Turn that wheel on the top.

08:47.348 --> 08:49.808
Holy smoke.

08:49.809 --> 08:52.143
Half that mountain is coming down.

08:52.144 --> 08:55.189
Hey, the guy in the red sweater.

08:55.356 --> 08:58.346
That avalanche is gonna nail him.

09:37.940 --> 09:40.440
That's an avalanche.

09:41.068 --> 09:43.568
On Red Eye.

09:50.494 --> 09:53.413
No. No.

10:00.128 --> 10:03.488
Come on.
Come on, MacGyver, beat it.

10:12.182 --> 10:14.682
Oh, no!

10:51.846 --> 10:54.346
Avalanche! Emergency!

10:55.141 --> 10:58.477
Listen, a friend of mine just got caught
in an avalanche on the Red Eye trail.

10:58.478 --> 11:00.062
We know,
we got a call from the top.

11:00.063 --> 11:01.855
They're forming a search team
right now.

11:01.856 --> 11:04.024
You stay here.
We'II Iet you know if we find him.

11:04.025 --> 11:06.735
You don't understand. I saw him
go under. I can Iead you there.

11:06.736 --> 11:07.945
- You sure?
- Yes!

11:07.946 --> 11:09.780
You know how to drive
one of these things?

11:09.781 --> 11:13.561
- That, I can do.
- AII right, Iet's go.

11:27.924 --> 11:30.424
Arnie, come on back to me.

11:30.676 --> 11:32.886
Arnie, talk to me.

11:32.887 --> 11:35.096
He probably got hit
by the avalanche too.

11:35.097 --> 11:37.891
- What are we gonna do now?
- About Arnie?

11:37.892 --> 11:40.101
Nothing.
They can't connect him to us.

11:40.102 --> 11:42.229
So we can get out of here, huh?

11:42.230 --> 11:43.980
What's the matter with you?

11:43.981 --> 11:47.317
That guy in the red sweater
was probably Phil's contact.

11:47.318 --> 11:50.362
- He's dead.
- So they'II dig him up.

11:50.363 --> 11:51.988
And they'II find the film.

11:51.989 --> 11:56.076
You stay here, and you make sure
you search that body before they do.

11:56.077 --> 11:58.119
They might not find him till spring.

11:58.120 --> 12:02.030
Get up the slope.
I'm going back to town.

12:04.585 --> 12:07.420
I hate this weather. I hate it!

12:07.421 --> 12:11.300
Willie, Iisten, Iet's go home.

12:14.637 --> 12:19.477
I just have to see snow,
I come down with something.

12:20.643 --> 12:23.937
- Tell him to work further east.
- AII right.

12:23.938 --> 12:26.689
Listen, can't we get
some more people to help?

12:26.690 --> 12:29.067
There weren't that many skiers
Ieft on the hill,

12:29.068 --> 12:30.985
and the patrol's
stretched to the Iimit.

12:30.986 --> 12:33.529
Are you sure this is where
your friend went under?

12:33.530 --> 12:36.366
Yes, I marked it by those trees.

12:36.367 --> 12:39.285
Well, one set of pines
Iooks pretty much Iike another.

12:39.286 --> 12:41.287
This is the spot. I'm sure of it.

12:41.288 --> 12:43.664
Look, I hate to have to tell you this,

12:43.665 --> 12:46.584
but only one out of 25
survives an avalanche.

12:46.585 --> 12:49.085
MacGyver will be the one.

12:53.550 --> 12:57.345
Supposing MacGyver did find
a pocket for himself in here,

12:57.346 --> 12:58.971
how Iong could he hold out?

12:58.972 --> 13:02.183
People have stayed alive
for five or six days.

13:02.184 --> 13:06.062
But between the hypothermia
and the frostbite,

13:06.063 --> 13:08.563
it's not a pretty picture.

13:13.653 --> 13:20.076
I once fell off a surfboard and the
wave kept turning me over and over.

13:20.077 --> 13:21.994
I thought I was swimming
toward the surface,

13:21.995 --> 13:24.997
till I came up with a handful of sand.

13:24.998 --> 13:27.750
So I knew that digging through
the snow wouldn't mean much

13:27.751 --> 13:31.241
if I was going in the wrong direction.

13:32.589 --> 13:35.519
I had to find which way was up.

13:36.635 --> 13:40.205
And I knew that gravity
would tell me.

13:43.183 --> 13:46.102
- Nothing, Jim.
- Keep trying.

13:47.187 --> 13:49.897
I didn't know how deep
I was buried,

13:49.898 --> 13:53.609
but I did know my ski pole,
with a few alterations,

13:53.610 --> 13:57.030
could become a 5-foot-long drill.

14:00.033 --> 14:02.242
Air Scout to Rescue Team One.

14:02.243 --> 14:05.813
Air Scout to Rescue Team One.
Come in.

14:07.207 --> 14:08.999
Rescue One, come in.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.752
We've got an unstable cornice
on the south base of the mountain.

14:11.753 --> 14:13.962
It looks like it could
come down at any time.

14:13.963 --> 14:16.924
Get your team together
and leave the area within ten minutes.

14:16.925 --> 14:20.052
Repeat. Leave the area
within ten minutes. Over.

14:20.053 --> 14:22.553
Roger, Base.

14:36.903 --> 14:39.780
I just got a report from the chopper
near the summit.

14:39.781 --> 14:42.282
There's a Iot of unstable snow
up there.

14:42.283 --> 14:43.742
Meaning what?

14:43.743 --> 14:46.995
They're gonna trigger
a controlled slide.

14:46.996 --> 14:50.749
- When?
- They're planting the charges now.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.168
Well, they can't do that
until we find MacGyver.

14:53.169 --> 14:55.795
I'm sorry, but these people
just don't see it that way.

14:55.796 --> 14:58.798
Unless they break up those ridges,
the whole mountain could cut Ioose,

14:58.799 --> 15:01.676
bury the Iodge,
the town and everything.

15:01.677 --> 15:03.094
Well, how much time do we have?

15:03.095 --> 15:08.308
They're giving us ten minutes, and
then we gotta get out of this area fast.

15:08.309 --> 15:12.228
If there was anyone looking for me,
I had to let them know where I was.

15:12.229 --> 15:17.979
Otherwise, my prospects for a long life
were downright chilling.

15:19.487 --> 15:25.257
I felt the ski pole break through
the surface, but just barely.

15:26.535 --> 15:31.905
Base to Rescue Team One.
Base to Rescue Team One. Come in.

15:32.958 --> 15:34.917
This is Rescue Team One.

15:34.918 --> 15:37.086
Terminate your search
and return to base.

15:37.087 --> 15:39.737
Repeat, terminate your search.

15:39.882 --> 15:42.300
Avalanche Control is about
to detonate the charges.

15:42.301 --> 15:44.801
- Roger, Base.
- Listen.

15:45.179 --> 15:48.973
They can't set those charges off when
there's a chance MacGyver's still alive.

15:48.974 --> 15:50.641
I'm sorry. I know how you feel.

15:50.642 --> 15:54.729
I've Iost two friends this way, but there
is a whole town they're trying to save.

15:54.730 --> 15:58.149
We're close to him! Look, I can tell.

15:58.150 --> 16:01.485
PIease, ask them
for another five minutes.

16:01.486 --> 16:05.199
- Okay, I'II ask.
- Thanks.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.865
This is Rescue Team One.

16:21.214 --> 16:25.926
I had to send up a signal and hope
someone was around to see it.

16:25.927 --> 16:28.804
My bandana and my ski pole
gave me a signal flag,

16:28.805 --> 16:31.433
and a way to get it flying.

16:32.434 --> 16:35.896
All I needed was a counterweight.

16:36.605 --> 16:41.895
And the zipper-pull from my ski pants
would do just fine.

16:45.822 --> 16:49.367
- Base out.
- Rescue Team One out.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.370
They said that they were
taking a chance

16:53.371 --> 16:55.539
just having us here
Iooking for your friend.

16:55.540 --> 16:58.083
I could only get
a couple more minutes.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.584
I'm sorry.

17:08.887 --> 17:11.396
What I had was a parachute.

17:11.556 --> 17:18.486
I just hoped it would stay in the air
long enough for someone to notice it.

17:51.762 --> 17:54.431
Base to Rescue Team One,
your time is up.

17:54.432 --> 17:56.892
You must leave the area
immediately.

17:56.893 --> 18:00.313
Roger, Base.
Rescue Team One out.

18:00.980 --> 18:05.740
AII right, people, that's it!
Let's head back down.

18:06.277 --> 18:09.157
Riley, you heard her. Let's go.

18:10.239 --> 18:13.549
Grab those patrol groups
going down.

18:14.368 --> 18:17.618
Come on, Riley,
we're out of here.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.145
Look!

18:42.146 --> 18:45.316
This can only be MacGyver!

18:45.482 --> 18:47.358
- Yeah, go!
- What is it?

18:47.359 --> 18:49.859
Over here, this way!

18:53.824 --> 18:56.577
It's him! Here's his pole!

18:56.744 --> 19:00.294
- AII right!
- Bring shovels! Hurry up!

19:01.540 --> 19:04.750
We have a rescue in progress.
Repeat, a rescue in progress.

19:04.751 --> 19:07.251
Hold on those charges.

19:10.799 --> 19:12.800
Here.

19:12.801 --> 19:15.344
He's down here.
The pole was right here.

19:15.345 --> 19:17.845
Right. Dig.

19:20.017 --> 19:22.018
MacGyver, we're coming!

19:22.019 --> 19:25.062
Go easy, go easy.
We don't wanna hit him.

19:25.063 --> 19:28.275
- MacGyver!
- Yeah.

19:28.442 --> 19:30.067
Hurry up!

19:30.068 --> 19:32.236
I feel Iike a Popsicle.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.737
He's there!

19:35.490 --> 19:37.990
We're coming!

19:49.629 --> 19:50.963
- Wait a minute.
- Hold it.

19:50.964 --> 19:54.084
- Hey, I got a boot.
- AII right.

19:58.179 --> 20:00.681
Easy. Take it easy. Look out, now.

20:00.682 --> 20:03.642
We're coming, Mac! We're coming.

20:06.312 --> 20:08.812
Here. AII right.

20:08.857 --> 20:11.609
MacGyver, come on, we got you.

20:12.735 --> 20:16.239
- Careful, careful.
- Pull. Easy.

20:16.614 --> 20:19.114
Easy.

20:19.742 --> 20:21.910
Are you all right?

20:21.911 --> 20:24.411
Thanks, Pete.

20:24.581 --> 20:27.333
Come on with the blanket.

20:31.254 --> 20:34.054
I gotta get you to a hospital.

20:34.340 --> 20:36.258
I think I just got
a bump on my head.

20:36.259 --> 20:38.927
A cup of hot chocolate,
and I'II be fine.

20:38.928 --> 20:40.762
I think we can manage that.

20:40.763 --> 20:44.933
I don't know whether to hit you
or hug you. You scared me.

20:44.934 --> 20:46.977
Come on, guys.
We gotta get out of here.

20:46.978 --> 20:50.982
- Here.
- Here are his skis.

20:51.441 --> 20:52.774
Don't forget the poles.

20:52.775 --> 20:56.444
AII things considered,
you're a very Iucky man.

20:56.445 --> 20:59.406
Lucky to have a friend Iike you
that didn't give up on me.

20:59.407 --> 21:03.535
Well, are you willing to admit now
that skiing is dangerous?

21:03.536 --> 21:06.121
Skiing's fun.
Avalanches are dangerous.

21:06.122 --> 21:09.457
Walking. That's how man
is supposed to get where wants to go.

21:09.458 --> 21:11.293
One foot in front of the other.

21:11.294 --> 21:13.794
Safest thing in the--

21:15.715 --> 21:17.882
You were saying?

21:17.883 --> 21:20.927
- I think I broke my Ieg.
- You're kidding.

21:20.928 --> 21:22.721
No, I'm not kidding.

21:22.722 --> 21:28.302
Well, I guess we'd better
get you to the hospital then, huh?

21:34.316 --> 21:36.776
I can't believe this happened to me.

21:36.777 --> 21:38.736
Me, of all people.

21:38.737 --> 21:41.447
Well, it's just Iike Leo Durocher said:

21:41.448 --> 21:44.243
"Nice guys finish Iast."

21:44.410 --> 21:48.705
Not only do they finish Iast,
they finish Iast in a cast.

21:48.706 --> 21:52.000
- I feel as badly about it as you do.
- I know.

21:52.001 --> 21:54.377
You know, I really appreciate
your Ietting me stay here

21:54.378 --> 21:56.629
while my place is being fumigated,

21:56.630 --> 21:59.298
but I don't want you
waiting on me, okay?

21:59.299 --> 22:00.758
Just pretend I'm not here.

22:00.759 --> 22:04.779
AII right.
Lunch will be ready in a minute.

22:05.431 --> 22:07.932
Boy, don't you ever dust this place?

22:07.933 --> 22:10.351
Twice a year, Iike clockwork.

22:10.352 --> 22:12.186
Speaking of which, what is that?

22:12.187 --> 22:14.522
- It's my alarm clock.
- You're kidding.

22:14.523 --> 22:17.817
No, it runs off the current
from the potatoes.

22:17.818 --> 22:20.861
Well, you know what's
gonna happen, don't you?

22:20.862 --> 22:25.252
Bugs. You're gonna
have Iots of bugs. AII over.

22:28.370 --> 22:32.373
I don't understand why you would
want to run a clock on potatoes.

22:32.374 --> 22:36.024
Well, I tried tomatoes, but it ran fast.

22:36.878 --> 22:38.295
What?

22:38.296 --> 22:41.090
Pete, don't you have to
Iie down and rest?

22:41.091 --> 22:44.052
Yeah, I guess I should.

22:44.719 --> 22:46.887
But remember,
I don't want you waiting on me, now.

22:46.888 --> 22:50.684
- Okay.
- You got any soda?

22:50.851 --> 22:53.351
Ginger ale would be nice.

22:55.188 --> 22:57.688
Yeah.

23:11.371 --> 23:15.624
Willie. Willie, I got microbes
swarming all over me.

23:15.625 --> 23:17.918
Run down to Marty's.
Get me chicken soup.

23:17.919 --> 23:20.921
- How much you want?
- Just tell him how sick I am.

23:20.922 --> 23:23.422
- Yeah.
- He'II know.

23:26.761 --> 23:29.263
- You're back. Where's the film?
- I couldn't get it.

23:29.264 --> 23:31.598
They found this guy,
but he was still alive.

23:31.599 --> 23:33.267
I don't wanna hear what I'm hearing.

23:33.268 --> 23:35.852
When they dragged him out,
there was too many people around.

23:35.853 --> 23:38.730
Then his buddy broke his Ieg,
they had to take him to the hospital.

23:38.731 --> 23:41.775
Excuses don't help me. Don't you
understand what's at stake here?

23:41.776 --> 23:44.611
- I know, the cops are gonna--
- Forget the cops. They're nothing.

23:44.612 --> 23:46.446
It's the boys back East
I'm worried about.

23:46.447 --> 23:49.449
They'II chop me up in so many pieces,
I won't make a decent hamburger.

23:49.450 --> 23:51.950
What do you mean?

23:52.286 --> 23:56.039
The bets we've been taking
for the organization.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.750
AII of the money from the receipts

23:58.751 --> 24:00.710
didn't make its way back there.

24:00.711 --> 24:02.462
- You're skimming.
- You might say that.

24:02.463 --> 24:05.007
And that film is the proof.

24:06.968 --> 24:09.344
God bless you.

24:09.345 --> 24:13.432
Now, because you work for me,

24:13.599 --> 24:15.308
you're in as deep as I am.

24:15.309 --> 24:18.478
Wait a minute. I didn't know
about that until just now. Nothing!

24:18.479 --> 24:20.355
But they don't know that.

24:20.356 --> 24:23.316
And it's our job
to keep them from finding out.

24:23.317 --> 24:25.110
So what else you got?

24:25.111 --> 24:28.071
Okay, I-- I traced that car
that MacGyver and his pal had,

24:28.072 --> 24:31.241
and it's registered to this
"Pete Thornton."

24:31.242 --> 24:33.201
He's a big shot
at the Phoenix Foundation.

24:33.202 --> 24:35.712
It's a think tank downtown.

24:35.996 --> 24:39.196
- Yeah?
- Well, I'II stake it out.

24:41.126 --> 24:44.421
AII right. Take the van.

24:45.005 --> 24:48.945
- Call me as soon as you spot him.
- Okay.

24:48.968 --> 24:51.468
Jack?

24:52.513 --> 24:55.013
No excuses this time.

25:04.441 --> 25:08.381
Here you go, Pete.
One ginger ale, on ice.

25:11.031 --> 25:14.659
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing, nothing. It's fine.

25:14.660 --> 25:19.080
It's just that ginger ale is really best
over shaved ice, not cubes.

25:19.081 --> 25:20.873
These are cubes.

25:20.874 --> 25:22.416
I can shave some ice for you.

25:22.417 --> 25:24.710
No, no, don't bother, now.

25:24.711 --> 25:26.545
I don't want you waiting on me,
all right?

25:26.546 --> 25:28.923
Just pretend I'm not here.

25:28.924 --> 25:30.466
Okay.

25:30.467 --> 25:34.304
- A blanket would be nice.
- Yeah.

25:34.471 --> 25:36.889
You know, there's a draft
coming in these doors.

25:36.890 --> 25:40.830
Oh, I know.
I've been meaning to insulate.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.689
Thank you. Oh, that's great.

25:44.856 --> 25:47.024
- Anything else?
- No.

25:47.025 --> 25:49.525
- Sure?
- Yeah.

25:52.239 --> 25:54.779
Just go about your business.

25:55.033 --> 25:59.119
Now, Iook, don't stand over me, okay?
You're gonna make me nervous.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.620
AII right.

26:02.958 --> 26:06.919
How Iong did you say they were
gonna be fumigating your house?

26:06.920 --> 26:08.837
About a week.

26:08.838 --> 26:11.883
- Why?
- Just curious.

26:12.592 --> 26:15.095
Just curious.

26:26.272 --> 26:29.775
- That's not my pole.
- What'd you say?

26:29.776 --> 26:31.902
This pole. It's not mine.

26:31.903 --> 26:33.612
How can you tell?

26:33.613 --> 26:37.032
I had my name engraved near the grip.
This one doesn't have it.

26:37.033 --> 26:39.534
Well, somebody must have
taken yours by mistake.

26:39.535 --> 26:42.496
They're all the same, aren't they?
What difference does it make?

26:42.497 --> 26:45.875
Well, none, I guess.

26:47.335 --> 26:49.835
That's Iunch.

26:54.550 --> 26:57.050
Oh, yeah.

26:57.678 --> 27:01.890
- Did you ever break a bone?
- Well, when I was a kid.

27:01.891 --> 27:05.435
Couple of arms,
three fingers and a toe, I think.

27:05.436 --> 27:08.813
- Are you serious?
- Well, not all at once.

27:08.814 --> 27:11.691
However, our doctor did
eventually quit medicine

27:11.692 --> 27:14.472
and became a bigtime plasterer.

27:15.571 --> 27:18.157
Listen, could you...?

27:18.324 --> 27:20.824
Oh, yeah.

27:23.913 --> 27:26.413
Here you go.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.793
- Thanks. That's better.
- AII right?

27:29.794 --> 27:32.294
Yeah.

27:35.174 --> 27:37.674
- Tofu casserole.
- Tofu?

27:38.260 --> 27:40.930
Look, I cannot eat 1200 beans

27:40.971 --> 27:43.139
that have been battered
beyond recognition.

27:43.140 --> 27:45.684
Okay. What do you want?

27:48.103 --> 27:50.603
Chinese?

27:51.857 --> 27:55.443
I'II call Fong Loo's.
And I'II pay if you pick it up.

27:55.444 --> 27:59.030
AII right.
But you tell them to hold the MSG.

27:59.031 --> 28:01.531
Sure.

28:03.035 --> 28:05.370
Here. Know how to run that?

28:05.371 --> 28:07.998
I'm not completely helpless.

28:22.179 --> 28:23.721
I got your message.

28:23.722 --> 28:25.389
Which one of those guys
you pick up?

28:25.390 --> 28:27.516
The one they pulled
out of the snow, MacGyver.

28:27.517 --> 28:29.977
Dropped his buddy's car off
at the Phoenix Foundation

28:29.978 --> 28:32.478
and he got in a Jeep.

28:33.023 --> 28:38.793
Leland says to bring him over
to the cleaning plant right away.

28:48.121 --> 28:50.621
That's him.

28:58.089 --> 29:00.090
- Hey.
- Real quiet, friend,

29:00.091 --> 29:01.884
just go where I point you.

29:01.885 --> 29:05.955
Since you asked so nicely,
I'd be happy to.

29:07.599 --> 29:10.099
Get in!

29:24.908 --> 29:27.117
- This your idea of valet parking?
- Shut up.

29:27.118 --> 29:29.870
I've wasted enough time on you, pal,
I want that film.

29:29.871 --> 29:32.748
- What film?
- Don't play any games with me.

29:32.749 --> 29:35.584
That film is worth more
than the air that I breathe.

29:35.585 --> 29:36.960
I don't know what you mean.

29:36.961 --> 29:40.130
Save it, pal.
We followed Phil up to that ski joint.

29:40.131 --> 29:42.216
Arnie saw you bump into him
on the slope.

29:42.217 --> 29:43.717
That's when he gave you the film.

29:43.718 --> 29:47.018
So don't give me no song, no dance.

29:47.472 --> 29:50.057
You know, there's gotta be
a way to work all this out.

29:50.058 --> 29:52.934
I mean, if I do have what you want,

29:52.935 --> 29:57.564
it sort of puts us on a fifty-fifty footing,
wouldn't you say, huh?

29:57.565 --> 29:59.483
Sixty-forty?

29:59.484 --> 30:01.068
If something should happen to you,

30:01.069 --> 30:03.653
Iike if you should get shot
before I get that film,

30:03.654 --> 30:07.032
remember, I know about
your friend Thornton.

30:07.033 --> 30:09.533
So don't push your Iuck.

30:09.786 --> 30:12.286
Okay.

30:16.500 --> 30:19.211
- Egg roll?
- Get that away from me.

30:19.212 --> 30:20.837
Okay.

30:20.838 --> 30:23.298
Mind if I have one?
I'm a Iittle hungry.

30:23.299 --> 30:27.879
Suit yourself, friend.
It might be your Iast meal.

30:28.512 --> 30:31.012
How about a fortune cookie?

30:32.183 --> 30:35.223
Come on. Go ahead. Live a Iittle.

30:38.022 --> 30:41.191
Can't have egg rolls
without soy sauce.

30:41.192 --> 30:44.694
Let's see what kind
of a fortune you got.

30:44.695 --> 30:48.656
"Your Iife is gonna take
an unexpected turn."

30:48.657 --> 30:54.847
- They sure got you pegged.
- I'd say they got us both pegged, guy.

31:15.601 --> 31:18.353
What was that stuff? My eyes!

31:18.854 --> 31:21.022
That's twice you Iet him get away.

31:21.023 --> 31:23.563
What are you, a scorekeeper?

31:28.614 --> 31:30.364
What now?

31:30.365 --> 31:32.575
I Iifted his registration from the Jeep.

31:32.576 --> 31:36.356
We got his address.
Let's beat him home.

31:49.676 --> 31:51.177
Pete!

31:51.178 --> 31:52.678
Pete!

31:52.679 --> 31:57.099
You're not gonna believe
what just happened to--

32:01.897 --> 32:04.397
What?

32:15.368 --> 32:18.455
- Hello.
- Is this MacGyver?

32:18.622 --> 32:20.581
- Who's this?
- What's in a name?

32:20.582 --> 32:23.167
Suffice it to say,
we got your pal Thornton.

32:23.168 --> 32:24.793
You wanna hear?

32:24.794 --> 32:28.414
I'm all right. I'm all right, MacGyver.

32:29.299 --> 32:30.799
You got that?

32:30.800 --> 32:33.469
We'd Iike to extend
an invitation to you too.

32:33.470 --> 32:36.472
- What's this all about?
- Don't talk. Listen.

32:36.473 --> 32:40.559
There's a cleaning plant at
535 East 17th Street.

32:40.560 --> 32:43.937
You be there at 8:00 tonight
with the microfilm,

32:43.938 --> 32:50.228
or there won't be enough Ieft
of your friend to put in a small box.

32:51.487 --> 32:55.325
MacGyver better play this smart.

32:55.491 --> 32:57.991
For my sake.

32:59.662 --> 33:02.162
And yours.

33:02.832 --> 33:05.332
Microfilm.

33:06.294 --> 33:09.574
They think I've got their microfilm.

33:13.843 --> 33:15.635
Look out!

33:15.636 --> 33:18.136
Look out!

33:23.102 --> 33:25.854
- Hey, I'm really sorry.
- You guys all right?

33:25.855 --> 33:28.690
- Yeah, I think so.
- I'm just a beginner.

33:28.691 --> 33:31.191
My name's Phil.

33:32.236 --> 33:34.736
Phil.

33:35.448 --> 33:38.242
Phil, the ski pole. Of course.

34:14.652 --> 34:19.072
Whoever was holding Pete wanted
this microfilm badly enough to kill for it.

34:19.074 --> 34:21.574
I wanted to know why.

34:24.746 --> 34:27.165
I didn't have the proper device
to read the film,

34:27.166 --> 34:30.835
but I figured my microscope
could do the task.

34:30.835 --> 34:34.966
Except it was in
about five different pieces.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.768
If you don't have
the right equipment for the job,

34:47.768 --> 34:50.187
you just have to make it yourself.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.732
I wanted to magnify the film,

34:52.733 --> 34:56.360
so I just put it between
two glass slides.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.363
Now, all I had to do
was add a drop of clear liquid.

34:59.364 --> 35:02.659
Water, oil, whatever's handy.

35:09.249 --> 35:12.961
And there it is.
Instant magnification.

35:13.461 --> 35:15.796
Now, I don't know too much
about gambling,

35:15.797 --> 35:19.633
but I do know a bookie's
ledger sheet when I see one.

35:19.634 --> 35:22.094
You know,
friendship is a wonderful thing.

35:22.095 --> 35:24.430
That's how I know
MacGyver is gonna show up.

35:24.431 --> 35:25.848
We're not that close.

35:25.849 --> 35:29.143
Hey, you broke your Ieg
digging him out of an avalanche.

35:29.144 --> 35:30.811
That's close enough for me.

35:30.812 --> 35:33.312
He owes you.

35:33.440 --> 35:37.901
- Threats don't work on MacGyver.
- Oh, yeah? Well, this one better.

35:37.902 --> 35:41.321
When he gets here, the two of you
are going right in that dryer back there.

35:41.322 --> 35:43.657
You know what
that temperature gets up to?

35:43.658 --> 35:46.661
Four hundred and fifty degrees.

35:48.788 --> 35:51.288
Think about it.

36:40.172 --> 36:44.384
The laundry bags get into the building
on a series of overhead tracks,

36:44.385 --> 36:47.985
kind of like
a railroad switching yard.

36:50.558 --> 36:56.908
I wanted to get inside the laundry
using the best cover I could find.

37:00.943 --> 37:02.902
Yeah, what?

37:02.903 --> 37:05.446
I'm in the middle
of an important meet--

37:05.447 --> 37:07.866
GIoria.

37:07.867 --> 37:11.167
GIoria, I'II be home when I'm home.

37:18.711 --> 37:21.129
No, I'm not gonna stop for milk.

37:21.130 --> 37:22.547
Send the maid.

37:22.548 --> 37:26.259
Or break your heart
and you go to the market for a change.

37:26.260 --> 37:28.760
Goodbye.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.853
I got the sword of Socrates
hanging over my head,

37:36.854 --> 37:39.574
and she wants me to buy milk.

38:14.099 --> 38:16.599
What's that?

38:17.018 --> 38:20.958
It's coming from back there.
Check it out.

40:00.246 --> 40:02.330
You think that might be the cops?

40:02.331 --> 40:04.833
This Iaundry's been a perfect cover
for ten years.

40:04.834 --> 40:07.344
Why would they show up now?

40:08.087 --> 40:10.505
Unless MacGyver tipped them off.

40:10.506 --> 40:15.106
I see one uniform,
you get it right in the heart.

40:29.775 --> 40:32.275
What's going on out there?

40:39.409 --> 40:42.245
- Go shut off those machines.
- How do I know how to turn it off?

40:42.246 --> 40:44.038
They got switches, don't they?
On, off?

40:44.039 --> 40:47.042
Shut them off. And find Willie!

42:18.216 --> 42:20.716
Wait.

42:21.135 --> 42:24.806
Help! Hey, Iet me down!

42:24.972 --> 42:27.599
Hey, come on, this ain't funny.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.100
I'm afraid of heights!

42:30.103 --> 42:32.603
Help! Help!

42:33.147 --> 42:37.377
- Let me go!
- I'II take care of this myself.

43:15.981 --> 43:17.524
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

43:17.525 --> 43:21.255
Unless you wanna
Iook Iike a Iight bulb.

43:25.491 --> 43:27.991
See what I mean?

43:28.494 --> 43:33.123
You... You seem Iike
a reasonable guy to me.

43:33.290 --> 43:37.810
- We can make a deal, right?
- I don't think so.

43:37.920 --> 43:40.088
I think you'd better get used
to being cooped up.

43:40.089 --> 43:43.299
You can't do this to me,
you punk, you!

43:43.300 --> 43:47.610
Hey, Iet me out of here!
Listen to me, stupid!

43:48.555 --> 43:51.641
- Hi.
- Boy, am I glad to see you.

43:51.642 --> 43:53.643
They were gonna put me
in that spin-dryer.

43:53.644 --> 43:55.770
We couldn't Iet them do that.

43:55.771 --> 43:59.316
- You might shrink.
- Funny.

44:00.234 --> 44:03.110
Listen, that microfilm
that Leland wanted--

44:03.111 --> 44:05.321
Hidden right inside that ski pole.

44:05.322 --> 44:07.156
- Phil? You remember Phil?
- Yeah.

44:07.157 --> 44:08.741
He made the switch on us.

44:08.742 --> 44:10.743
What do you say
we get these guys picked up?

44:10.744 --> 44:12.244
Right.

44:12.245 --> 44:15.791
And next time we go on vacation,

44:15.957 --> 44:18.959
what do you say we go to Hawaii?
AII right?

44:18.960 --> 44:21.980
- Anything you say, Pete.
- Yeah.

44:25.133 --> 44:27.633
Pete?

44:28.929 --> 44:31.305
- You okay?
- No, I'm not.

44:31.306 --> 44:33.015
Is it the ankle again?

44:33.016 --> 44:35.769
No, no, that's fine.

44:36.353 --> 44:39.153
I think I broke the other one.

44:44.611 --> 44:47.821
Okay, we're doing fine,
now, just watch the wall. Watch the--

44:47.822 --> 44:49.865
Will you take it easy, MacGyver?

44:49.866 --> 44:52.242
I'm doing the best I can.

44:52.243 --> 44:55.704
Now, just go slowly. SIowly.
Watch the door.

44:55.705 --> 44:58.205
Watch the door.

45:01.461 --> 45:04.380
Well, I'm pooped.

45:04.547 --> 45:07.633
Getting this chair up those stairs
was no easy job.

45:07.634 --> 45:09.718
You were the one sitting down,
remember?

45:09.719 --> 45:11.887
Yeah, well, someone
had to navigate, didn't they?

45:11.888 --> 45:14.508
You could have hurt yourself.

45:18.227 --> 45:20.145
Now, can I get you anything?

45:20.146 --> 45:22.706
No, I think I'II just rest.

45:23.858 --> 45:27.008
That blanket, is that still around?

45:27.111 --> 45:29.611
Yeah.

45:30.323 --> 45:34.076
You know, breaking bones
gives me an appetite. I'm hungry.

45:34.077 --> 45:37.120
We still got tofu casserole
in the freezer.

45:37.121 --> 45:39.039
I am not going for Chinese.

45:39.040 --> 45:42.530
So who asked?
Did you hear me asking?

45:43.252 --> 45:46.546
- Some ice cream would be great.
- I don't have any.

45:46.547 --> 45:49.883
Oh, that's all right. It's no problem.

45:49.884 --> 45:54.764
About a quart of Rocky Road
with chocolate syrup

45:54.931 --> 45:59.061
and those sprinkles on top
and some cherries.

46:01.103 --> 46:03.693
- I'II go get some.
- Okay.

46:04.398 --> 46:08.968
But don't go on my account.
Only if you want to.

46:08.986 --> 46:11.112
I am dying to go, Pete.

46:11.113 --> 46:12.947
It'II make my day.

46:12.948 --> 46:15.200
You know, I hope I don't have to
stay here too Iong.

46:15.201 --> 46:17.871
Living with you is no picnic.
