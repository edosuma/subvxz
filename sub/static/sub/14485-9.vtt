Well, your garden variety
penguin lays one egg a year.

14:59.158 --> 15:03.032
Since the spill, our penguins
have been laying six eggs
every 15 minutes.

- [ All Gasp ]
- Also, the eggs hatch
in only 12 hours.

This man has over-gasped.

15:16.044 --> 15:18.874
If the birds keep multiplying,
there'll soon
be too many to count.

15:19.004 --> 15:22.051
Before long, the penguins will
exhaust their food supply...

15:22.182 --> 15:24.793
and starve to death.

15:24.923 --> 15:27.360
Oh, if only we hadn't
flown penguins to Pluto...

15:27.490 --> 15:30.145
and dumped oil on them,
this might never have happened.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.148
Can't we stop them
from multiplying?

15:32.278 --> 15:36.413
Yes, I reckon it is
our responsibility.
And thankfully, we have a plan.

We'll do anything.

15:54.126 --> 15:56.476
Isn't there some way
to keep them from breeding?

15:56.606 --> 15:59.870
Cold showers don't work
on Antarctic creatures.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.874
Surely you agree that a quick
semi-painless death...

16:03.004 --> 16:05.006
is a damn sight better
than weeks of starvation.

16:05.138 --> 16:08.619
Well, I suppose,
but I mean,

16:08.750 --> 16:12.448
I joined Penguins Unlimited
to love penguins,
not to hunt them.

are one and the same.

But if you haveto
shoot penguins, well,
you might as well enjoy it.

16:42.566 --> 16:46.875
I'm sorry,

it's not environmentalism.
