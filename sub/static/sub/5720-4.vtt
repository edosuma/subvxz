WEBVTT

00:02.975 --> 00:04.439
{Kumari Devi,}

00:04.828 --> 00:07.964
{we pray that}

00:08.929 --> 00:11.332
{with your blessing}

00:11.883 --> 00:13.885
{Taleju will bring the generosity}

00:15.171 --> 00:19.574
{of America to our cause.}

00:24.652 --> 00:27.322
BLAKE (over speaker): For the 9:30 a.m.
National Security Council meeting,

00:27.323 --> 00:29.158
- you'll need the memo on cyber security...
- Yeah.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.359
...which you took home.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.529
Worst bedtime reading ever.

00:33.530 --> 00:34.831
I can get you another copy.

00:34.832 --> 00:36.299
Ha! No need.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.535
Okay, so staff briefing

00:39.536 --> 00:41.604
after NSC, then... what?

00:41.605 --> 00:43.005
At 2:15, there's a reception

00:43.006 --> 00:46.275
for the departing Finnish ambassador.

00:46.276 --> 00:47.677
I hope he brings that salty licorice.

00:47.678 --> 00:48.911
God, I love that stuff.

00:48.912 --> 00:50.379
We'll look into that for you.

00:50.380 --> 00:51.747
Oh! Hey.

00:51.748 --> 00:53.282
Don't let me forget
about Henry's interview

00:53.283 --> 00:54.984
on <i>Book TV</i> on C-SPAN tomorrow, okay?

00:54.985 --> 00:58.054
It hath been ordained.

00:58.055 --> 01:00.422
That's a small biblical joke for Henry.

01:02.024 --> 01:03.426
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

01:03.427 --> 01:04.101
Thanks, babe.

01:04.102 --> 01:06.028
You know, you guys should
check it out, too.

01:06.029 --> 01:08.698
A Z-SPAN interview on Dad's
book about St. Francis

01:08.699 --> 01:10.233
that I already hear too much about?

01:10.234 --> 01:12.068
Well, if you actually
read your father's work

01:12.069 --> 01:13.336
instead of trashing it,

01:13.337 --> 01:15.271
you'd know how totally
UN-Franciscan that was.

01:15.272 --> 01:16.672
HENRY: Oh, word.

01:16.673 --> 01:18.241
I humbly and meekly apologize.

01:18.242 --> 01:20.343
JASON: He was also sort
of a revolutionary.

01:20.344 --> 01:21.978
Completely rejected any
form of material wealth.

01:21.979 --> 01:23.279
STEVIE: He also led

01:23.280 --> 01:24.547
the first environmental movement.

01:24.548 --> 01:25.779
Wait, you guys read it?

01:25.780 --> 01:27.283
I'll make you an
autographed copy, Noodle.

01:27.284 --> 01:28.451
You're gonna love it.

01:28.452 --> 01:29.852
Ooh. Burn.

01:29.853 --> 01:34.790
Wow, that is one manly breakfast
you got there, slugger.

01:34.791 --> 01:36.092
Jason is trying to bulk up for football.

01:36.093 --> 01:37.360
Isn't it cute?

01:37.361 --> 01:39.228
Okay, "cute" isn't exactly
what I'm going for.

01:39.229 --> 01:40.730
And slugger's baseball, Mom.

01:40.731 --> 01:42.098
Ooh. Okay.

01:42.099 --> 01:43.399
(phone buzzing)

01:43.400 --> 01:45.468
Stevie, why are you getting

01:45.469 --> 01:47.202
a call from the White House?

01:48.004 --> 01:49.272
Oh.

01:49.273 --> 01:51.474
It's Harrison.

01:51.475 --> 01:52.975
He's trying to ditch my caller ID.

01:52.976 --> 01:54.210
I'm not engaging.

01:54.211 --> 01:55.711
Oh.

01:55.712 --> 01:56.846
It's fine.

01:56.847 --> 01:57.813
You're allowed

01:57.814 --> 01:59.015
- to be relieved.
- Good.

01:59.016 --> 02:00.316
'Cause... well, we're just happy

02:00.317 --> 02:01.651
that you're making some good choices.

02:01.652 --> 02:02.985
I know.

02:02.986 --> 02:04.987
I totally deserve some bacon, right?

02:04.988 --> 02:06.322
I thought you were vegan.

02:06.323 --> 02:08.390
Bacon is my downfall.

02:08.392 --> 02:09.959
Hey, could you save some
for the linebacker?

02:09.960 --> 02:11.327
All right, I'm off to the White House

02:11.328 --> 02:13.229
to eat more crow about Russia.

02:13.230 --> 02:14.864
I don't get how that's your fault.

02:14.865 --> 02:15.998
You happened to be in Russia

02:15.999 --> 02:17.066
when Ostrov's widow made a power play.

02:17.067 --> 02:19.535
Exactly. I was there.

02:19.536 --> 02:21.137
They're just mad because
you made a better president.

02:21.138 --> 02:23.105
Acting president.

02:23.106 --> 02:25.174
MATT: <i>No way, man.</i>

02:25.175 --> 02:28.544
The best ramen is Noodle
Noodle Dumpling on H Street.

02:28.545 --> 02:30.046
No, hands down.

02:30.047 --> 02:31.113
Yes.

02:31.114 --> 02:32.848
- Oh, sorry, it jammed last time.
- I see that.

02:32.849 --> 02:34.450
Well, if you want, I
could take a look at it.

02:34.451 --> 02:35.651
- Don't have time.
- Okay.

02:35.652 --> 02:37.220
I'm not talking to you.

02:37.221 --> 02:39.088
Hey, buddy, can I call you back?

02:39.089 --> 02:41.390
Okay.

02:41.391 --> 02:42.358
Sorry about the printer.

02:42.359 --> 02:43.759
It's fine.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.394
Are you sure?

02:45.395 --> 02:47.997
Okay, I appreciate that you're
willing to share an office

02:47.998 --> 02:49.131
in spite of everything,

02:49.132 --> 02:51.334
but I don't think this is working.

02:51.335 --> 02:53.269
What? Look, you can
totally have the printer.

02:53.270 --> 02:55.705
And I don't have to be
so loud on the phone.

02:55.706 --> 02:56.812
I just think that we'd both

02:56.813 --> 02:58.407
be better at our jobs if
we did them separately,

02:58.408 --> 03:00.376
now that we're broken up.

03:00.377 --> 03:01.577
Hang on for a sec.

03:01.578 --> 03:02.545
Can we talk about this?

03:02.546 --> 03:03.546
What is there to talk about?

03:03.547 --> 03:05.848
It's over. We need to move on.

03:05.849 --> 03:07.083
Have you seen this?

03:07.084 --> 03:09.518
- MATT: Bold graphic.
- It's <i>Inside Lowdown.</i>

03:09.519 --> 03:11.621
Their below the fold is cops twerking.

03:11.622 --> 03:14.390
It's bad enough we had
to endure Maria Ostrov

03:14.391 --> 03:16.192
accusing the U.S. of
conspiring against Russia,

03:16.193 --> 03:19.262
but this makes it look like

03:19.263 --> 03:22.365
some <i>Real Housewives</i> episode.

03:22.366 --> 03:23.899
DAISY: I'll push back.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.701
But it's hard to take a
stand against a paper

03:25.702 --> 03:26.969
that equates a diplomatic crisis with...

03:26.970 --> 03:29.438
- Cops twerking?
- MATT: Oh, I was gonna say

03:29.439 --> 03:30.973
naked lady mud wrestling.

03:30.974 --> 03:32.208
That sounds fun.

03:32.209 --> 03:34.509
What'd I miss?

03:37.647 --> 03:40.549
"Catfight"? Really?

03:40.550 --> 03:42.518
NADINE: We'll push back on that, ma'am.

03:42.519 --> 03:44.920
Why don't we move into
the items of the day?

03:44.921 --> 03:46.756
At least I don't look chinny.

03:46.757 --> 03:48.251
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

03:48.252 --> 03:50.726
The Polar Research Institute of China....

03:50.727 --> 03:53.029
- Oh, PRIC.
- ...began construction on a new

03:53.030 --> 03:56.365
weather station in the Svalbard
archipelago in the Arctic.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.834
As long as the station is
researching the effects

03:58.835 --> 04:02.305
of climate change, like it
claims, it doesn't warrant

04:02.306 --> 04:04.307
further scrutiny by the Arctic Council.

04:04.308 --> 04:06.776
But if they try and claim drilling rights

04:06.777 --> 04:09.412
or lay claim to any of the
new waters opening up

04:09.413 --> 04:11.447
due to the melting of
the polar ice cap...

04:11.448 --> 04:13.548
And we'll be mad because
they beat us to the punch?

04:13.549 --> 04:15.190
Basically.

04:15.191 --> 04:17.002
DAISY: We need to send a cable
to the Foreign Ministry

04:17.003 --> 04:19.112
cautioning the Chinese Arctic
and Antarctic Administration.

04:19.113 --> 04:20.415
ELIZABETH: Yeah, that's fine.
Let's draft it.

04:20.416 --> 04:22.974
So when did you lose
the lumberjack look?

04:22.975 --> 04:25.410
Was that new baby or Neo hipster?

04:25.411 --> 04:27.479
- Little of both.
- Welcome back.

04:27.480 --> 04:31.082
In some positive news, I just
got inside word from the Hill.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.084
Looks like our disaster relief bill

04:33.085 --> 04:34.953
for Nepal is going to pass tomorrow.

04:34.954 --> 04:36.187
- Awesome!
- DAISY: Amazing.

04:36.188 --> 04:37.956
- Good work.
- Hey, uh,

04:37.957 --> 04:38.593
who caved?

04:38.594 --> 04:40.458
Senator Fenworth seems
to have been persuaded.

04:40.459 --> 04:41.760
DAISY: We don't persuade.

04:41.761 --> 04:43.461
- We inform.
- ELIZABETH: Fenworth. Wasn't he

04:43.462 --> 04:45.997
the Tin Man that voted against
subsidized school lunches?

04:45.998 --> 04:47.465
Apparently, he was quite moved

04:47.466 --> 04:50.001
by his visitation with the
Royal Kumari of Nepal.

04:50.002 --> 04:52.237
DAISY: So, seeing all the
devastated villages didn't do it,

04:52.238 --> 04:53.371
but five minutes

04:53.372 --> 04:54.939
with a 12-year-old
goddess convinced him?

04:54.940 --> 04:57.375
A 12-year-old goddess
who does not speak.

04:57.376 --> 04:58.843
MATT: Oh. The Kumari

04:58.844 --> 05:02.080
is mute only when she's
in full ceremonial dress

05:02.081 --> 05:05.449
and she's inhabited
by the goddess Taleju.

05:06.317 --> 05:07.719
Nobody else reads the briefs?

05:07.720 --> 05:09.387
BLAKE: Ma'am, you should probably

05:09.388 --> 05:10.321
leave for the NSC meeting.

05:10.322 --> 05:12.257
Right. They keep starting without me.

05:12.258 --> 05:13.858
Oh, you've got a press meet-and-greet

05:13.859 --> 05:15.627
with the Kumari after the vote tomorrow.

05:15.628 --> 05:17.829
I'll be sure to thank her
for charming Congress

05:17.830 --> 05:21.933
out of its compassion fatigue,
all without saying a word.

05:21.934 --> 05:24.102
I'm sure there's a few cabinet members

05:24.103 --> 05:27.138
who believe I could learn
a thing or two from her. Yeah.

05:27.139 --> 05:29.407
CRAIG: <i>So, really,</i>

05:29.408 --> 05:31.943
cyber security is just
the tip of the iceberg.

05:31.944 --> 05:34.446
JACKSON: Pretty big tip, let's hope.

05:34.447 --> 05:37.449
DALTON: Let's catch Elizabeth up.

05:37.450 --> 05:39.128
Craig has come up with a new

05:39.129 --> 05:40.295
defense initiative.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.097
- Go ahead and lay it out.
- Of course.

05:42.098 --> 05:44.299
Now, when my grandfather
went to the Philippines

05:44.300 --> 05:46.167
at the beginning of World War II,

05:46.168 --> 05:50.872
he was armed with a rifle
that was designed in 1904.

05:50.873 --> 05:52.807
The next years saw a transformation

05:52.808 --> 05:57.078
of U.S. Defense that changed the
shape of geopolitics forever.

05:57.079 --> 05:59.514
And we pretty much haven't
touched it since then.

05:59.515 --> 06:01.182
So while we're still spending billions

06:01.183 --> 06:03.451
on aircraft carriers and submarines,

06:03.452 --> 06:05.987
we're getting cut off at the
knees by a backroom criminal

06:05.988 --> 06:07.422
with some malware and a laptop.

06:07.423 --> 06:08.890
Or a weather station in the Antarctic.

06:08.891 --> 06:11.526
That research station was
approved by the Arctic Council.

06:11.527 --> 06:13.661
How are we seeing it
as an act of aggression?

06:13.662 --> 06:15.029
Exactly.

06:15.030 --> 06:17.031
It's under the radar.

06:17.032 --> 06:18.900
It's cheap.

06:18.901 --> 06:21.403
And for the cost of one
weather station, China gets

06:21.404 --> 06:23.271
complete access to our
satellite communications,

06:23.272 --> 06:24.773
and quite possibly

06:24.774 --> 06:28.042
shares them with our adversaries
on the Arctic Council,

06:28.043 --> 06:29.444
who, as you pointed out,

06:29.445 --> 06:31.813
didn't exactly protest this
thing in the first place.

06:31.814 --> 06:35.183
So, we're thinking China and
Russia are working together?

06:35.184 --> 06:37.986
To undermine our global
security interests?

06:37.987 --> 06:39.487
Does that seem so impossible to you?

06:39.488 --> 06:41.823
Look, I get shifting our focus

06:41.824 --> 06:44.859
to cyber offense after what
happened with Air Force One,

06:44.860 --> 06:48.296
but battlefield robotics,
laser weapons systems?

06:48.297 --> 06:50.598
What about the impact
that this is going to have

06:50.599 --> 06:51.866
on diplomatic relations?

06:51.867 --> 06:55.203
Well, to that, I would
say, Madam Secretary...

06:55.204 --> 06:57.605
you've had your turn.

06:57.606 --> 07:00.475
And you see where that led us.

07:00.476 --> 07:02.911
This is a done deal, Bess.

07:02.912 --> 07:06.049
Figure out a way to make it work.

07:06.282 --> 07:07.515
CRAIG: Looking at our

07:07.516 --> 07:09.417
budgetary goals, this

07:09.418 --> 07:11.753
is a three-phase process.

07:11.754 --> 07:12.921
First and foremost...

07:12.922 --> 07:16.223
Military transformation?

07:17.091 --> 07:19.527
So, that's our new foreign policy?

07:19.528 --> 07:22.063
It's that damn Air Force One attack.

07:22.064 --> 07:26.401
I realize this is a shift in
focus, but it's long overdue.

07:26.402 --> 07:29.237
I mean, NASA got a total
overhaul, what, 20 years ago?

07:29.238 --> 07:31.339
Meanwhile, Defense is lumbering along

07:31.340 --> 07:33.475
with World War II-era technology

07:33.476 --> 07:36.945
while we're being hammered
by cyber attacks.

07:36.946 --> 07:39.414
So, when you say "shift in
focus," what does that mean

07:39.415 --> 07:40.648
for State?

07:40.649 --> 07:42.050
Re-prioritizing the budget.

07:42.051 --> 07:43.551
Some programs will be affected.

07:43.552 --> 07:45.086
How long are we talk...?

07:45.087 --> 07:46.387
I can't speak to that.

07:46.388 --> 07:47.889
JAY: Let me understand this.

07:47.890 --> 07:50.758
Initiatives that actually
build peace and stability,

07:50.759 --> 07:52.794
like trade agreements,

07:52.795 --> 07:56.431
supporting education
and economic growth,

07:56.432 --> 07:58.833
building partnerships and alliances...

07:58.834 --> 08:01.035
we're just gonna push some
of that aside so we can

08:01.036 --> 08:03.471
focus on spying on everyone better?

08:03.472 --> 08:05.473
NADINE: There could be an upside.

08:05.474 --> 08:07.442
We'll have less oversight.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.644
Exactly. Think of this
as an opportunity.

08:09.645 --> 08:10.945
You know, we can be creative,

08:10.946 --> 08:12.313
fly under the radar,

08:12.314 --> 08:15.116
lay groundwork for when things
swing back in our direction.

08:15.117 --> 08:16.718
Yeah, until we're all fired
for being redundant.

08:16.719 --> 08:19.320
I get that this is frustrating, okay?

08:19.321 --> 08:21.689
But this is what's happening,
so we all need to get on board.

08:21.690 --> 08:24.626
Read the proposal and come up
with some ideas and solutions.

08:24.627 --> 08:26.528
Thank you.

08:26.529 --> 08:29.497
- (door closes)
- We'll reconvene after lunch.

08:29.498 --> 08:31.765
(water running)

08:38.640 --> 08:41.775
I'm guessing this is
Sterling's work, ma'am?

08:41.777 --> 08:45.513
You know that he thinks that
the Chinese research station

08:45.514 --> 08:47.515
is a collusion with Russia

08:47.516 --> 08:51.151
to intercept our satellite communications?

08:52.253 --> 08:55.023
(sighs)

08:55.024 --> 08:57.058
Thank you.

08:57.059 --> 08:59.326
You think it's a possibility?

09:00.762 --> 09:02.764
Well, put it this way.

09:02.765 --> 09:05.934
I read that one of the projects
at the research station

09:05.935 --> 09:07.936
is to extract an ice core

09:07.937 --> 09:11.639
that's just a little longer
than the one extracted

09:11.640 --> 09:13.207
by the U.S.

09:13.208 --> 09:16.377
It always comes down to who's
got the longer core, doesn't it?

09:16.378 --> 09:18.413
I also think

09:18.414 --> 09:21.482
we've done our share of
spying on other nations,

09:21.483 --> 09:23.284
and I'm not so sure one research station

09:23.285 --> 09:26.788
warrants a complete military overhaul.

09:26.789 --> 09:29.490
But they don't ask me these questions.

09:29.491 --> 09:31.826
They don't ask me either, anymore.

09:31.827 --> 09:33.728
You'll find a way to be heard.

09:33.729 --> 09:35.763
- (door opens)
- DAISY: I'm sorry to interrupt,

09:35.764 --> 09:37.198
Madam Secretary.

09:37.199 --> 09:38.433
Oh, the tablet of doom.

09:38.434 --> 09:40.335
Better make it quick, while
we still have a budget.

09:40.336 --> 09:42.003
It's actually somewhat personal.

09:42.004 --> 09:43.504
Oh. Excuse me.

09:43.505 --> 09:45.306
(whispering): Thank you.

09:45.307 --> 09:47.208
One of my contacts at the <i>Chronicle</i>

09:47.209 --> 09:49.344
just forwarded a query
that's going around.

09:49.345 --> 09:51.846
- (door closes)
- It seems to... well,

09:51.847 --> 09:55.216
it seems to be from someone
in possession of...

09:55.217 --> 09:56.918
Spit it out, Daisy.

09:56.919 --> 09:58.886
Someone is trying to sell
photos of your daughter

09:58.887 --> 10:00.888
and the president's son being... intimate.

10:00.889 --> 10:03.324
- What?!
- They included

10:03.325 --> 10:05.360
one photo as proof, but once the seller

10:05.361 --> 10:06.628
gets paid, they're promising more.

10:06.629 --> 10:08.929
- More than this?
- Everything.

10:11.716 --> 10:18.392
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

10:25.756 --> 10:27.358
Find out everyone who got this query.

10:27.359 --> 10:29.794
I want a full list.
Does Russell Jackson know yet?

10:29.795 --> 10:31.368
I literally just found
out two minutes ago.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.764
I want us in front of it with him.

10:33.765 --> 10:35.800
Come on, Henry, pick up.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.201
We can kill this, right?

10:37.202 --> 10:38.703
We're gonna do everything
we can, obviously,

10:38.704 --> 10:40.571
but with the teaser photo
already out there...

10:40.572 --> 10:41.639
Teaser photo?

10:41.640 --> 10:42.974
- Like an ad campaign?
- I'm sorry.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.343
Ma'am, Russell Jackson wants to see you

10:45.344 --> 10:46.477
in his office.

10:46.478 --> 10:47.778
He says it's extremely urgent.

10:47.779 --> 10:49.480
So much for getting in front of it.

10:49.481 --> 10:51.816
JACKSON: We've contacted
every outlet that got the query.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.684
If they make the purchase,

10:53.685 --> 10:56.120
they'll feel the full force
of the Executive Branch.

10:56.121 --> 10:58.556
But isn't Harrison enough
of a public figure

10:58.557 --> 11:00.691
that they can claim fair use?

11:00.692 --> 11:03.694
Not if I have anything to do with it.

11:03.695 --> 11:06.998
Half an hour ago, I thought
Maria Ostrov was the only thing

11:06.999 --> 11:10.301
that could hijack the news cycle
and run down our poll numbers.

11:10.302 --> 11:13.004
You thinking this is another
hack, like Air Force One?

11:13.005 --> 11:14.271
This wasn't a hack.

11:14.272 --> 11:16.907
The president's son lost his phone

11:16.908 --> 11:18.843
last week, didn't bother to tell anybody.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.245
Didn't it have a-a password or...?

11:21.246 --> 11:24.615
Apparently, he thought
they were inconvenient.

11:24.616 --> 11:26.183
We need to move forward.

11:26.184 --> 11:27.918
I need you to talk to Stevie,

11:27.919 --> 11:29.654
find out what else we're looking at.

11:29.655 --> 11:31.255
God forbid there's video.

11:31.256 --> 11:32.923
And you're gonna talk
to Harrison, too, right?

11:32.924 --> 11:34.392
Just so we're clear on who did what?

11:34.393 --> 11:36.394
I don't really give a damn who did what.

11:36.395 --> 11:39.062
Yes, we're talking to
Harrison the heroin addict.

11:41.599 --> 11:45.036
We need to corroborate
so we can contain the blast.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.070
Get me a report.

11:53.310 --> 11:55.012
Obviously this is a
matter we need to treat

11:55.013 --> 11:56.847
with the highest degree of sensitivity.

11:56.848 --> 11:58.849
This is a potential criminal
act against two people

11:58.850 --> 12:00.518
who happen to be related
to public figures.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.253
The incident is currently
under investigation

12:02.254 --> 12:04.288
and we have nothing more to add.

12:04.289 --> 12:06.090
But this is assuming the photos get out.

12:06.091 --> 12:08.259
We're up against freedom
of the press on that.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.593
We're doing everything we can

12:09.594 --> 12:10.995
to find the source and lock this down.

12:10.996 --> 12:12.663
Legally.

12:12.664 --> 12:13.731
Thank you.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.900
Everybody, sit back down.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.636
I'm not here to tell you what
to do in your off hours.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.638
But you know what I'm about to say.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.740
If any of you have any digital evidence

12:22.741 --> 12:24.241
on any of your devices anywhere

12:24.242 --> 12:26.243
that you don't want everyone to see,

12:26.244 --> 12:28.245
now is the time to delete it.

12:28.246 --> 12:30.514
Print out a copy for your private records,

12:30.515 --> 12:32.950
lock it in a drawer,
but no digital footprint.

12:32.951 --> 12:34.085
NADINE: Okay.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.019
Thank you, everyone.

12:40.024 --> 12:43.627
So... if I'm on Tinder,

12:43.628 --> 12:45.995
that's not a... a problem, right?

12:47.431 --> 12:48.733
Um, I would say,

12:48.734 --> 12:51.402
unless there's something
obscene in your profile

12:51.403 --> 12:53.537
then, by all means, date away.

12:53.538 --> 12:55.505
Okay, cool.

12:56.674 --> 12:58.776
It's not weird that I
asked you that, is it?

12:58.777 --> 12:59.777
Of course not.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.779
I appreciate the heads-up.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.914
Okay.

13:03.915 --> 13:05.216
I'm gonna...

13:05.217 --> 13:06.917
Yeah.

13:06.918 --> 13:08.852
That was weird.

13:11.489 --> 13:13.390
But how?

13:13.391 --> 13:15.459
HENRY: Well, apparently
he lost his phone,

13:15.460 --> 13:16.894
and it fell into the wrong hands.

13:16.895 --> 13:18.896
Now I know why he was calling

13:18.897 --> 13:20.331
from all those other numbers.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.733
ELIZABETH: Sweetie, it's completely
wrong that this happened,

13:22.734 --> 13:24.435
but now we have to deal with it.

13:24.436 --> 13:26.536
Can you tell me what else is on there?

13:29.640 --> 13:32.175
I'm gonna get us some coffee.

13:33.778 --> 13:36.247
Um, what do you mean, "What else"?

13:36.248 --> 13:40.918
Well, the guy, whoever took the phone,

13:40.919 --> 13:42.953
sent out one of the photos.

13:42.954 --> 13:44.555
It's already out there?!

13:44.556 --> 13:46.423
Not yet.

13:46.424 --> 13:49.960
"Sent" more like, "proof
that there's more."

13:49.961 --> 13:52.029
(groaning): Oh, my God.

13:52.030 --> 13:54.365
You're both in bed, nothing's showing.

13:54.366 --> 13:58.002
But I need to know what else
there is so I can manage it.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.238
Um...

14:01.239 --> 14:03.808
I don't know, I-I don't remember.

14:03.809 --> 14:05.376
Baby, I get that this is hard,

14:05.377 --> 14:07.010
but the White House needs to know.

14:10.714 --> 14:12.750
Harrison said he was gonna delete them.

14:12.751 --> 14:13.918
He promised me.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.619
I mean, we were just goofing around.

14:15.620 --> 14:16.654
It was not a big deal.

14:16.655 --> 14:18.222
It was one time.

14:18.223 --> 14:19.623
- So there is nudity?
- Nothing gross.

14:19.624 --> 14:23.561
But, yeah, we were in bed, so yes.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.529
Were you guys...?

14:25.530 --> 14:28.566
I mean, they're...
they're gonna probably ask...

14:28.567 --> 14:30.267
were you guys doing anything?

14:30.268 --> 14:31.268
Of course not.

14:31.269 --> 14:32.369
It was after.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.805
Thank you.

14:34.806 --> 14:37.240
Mom, I'm sorry.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.143
So am I.

14:46.784 --> 14:48.785
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:52.823 --> 14:56.160
You remember that weekend at Falls Lake?

14:56.161 --> 14:58.162
Oh, of course.

14:58.163 --> 14:59.996
(chuckles)

15:00.764 --> 15:03.266
Thank God there was no Internet.

15:04.869 --> 15:07.471
- This is different.
- Is it?

15:07.472 --> 15:10.808
Yes. I work for the president
of the United States,

15:10.809 --> 15:13.444
who's running for re-election.
She can't just pretend

15:13.445 --> 15:15.379
she's not aware of that anymore.

15:15.380 --> 15:19.383
And, I mean, how many dumb
moves are we gonna give her?

15:19.384 --> 15:23.187
How far does it have to go for
her to realize what's at stake?

15:23.188 --> 15:26.323
And not just for her but for all of us.

15:26.324 --> 15:28.025
It sucks that this happened. I get that.

15:28.026 --> 15:30.761
But is it really her job to prevent it?

15:30.762 --> 15:32.029
Yes! Everybody knows

15:32.030 --> 15:34.932
you don't put nudie
pictures on your telephone.

15:34.933 --> 15:37.868
- Cell phone.
- Whatever.

15:37.869 --> 15:42.305
- (sighs)
- This puzzle is ridiculously hard.

15:43.007 --> 15:45.308
What?

15:47.011 --> 15:48.746
If these pictures get out,

15:48.747 --> 15:51.682
you know what the world
would do to Stevie.

15:51.683 --> 15:54.018
I just hate to see you do it first.

15:54.019 --> 15:57.320
- What's that?
- Blame her.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.290
Morning. So, I have a draft
of that diplomatic cable

16:08.291 --> 16:09.864
about the Chinese weather
station in the Arctic.

16:09.865 --> 16:10.605
Right.

16:10.606 --> 16:13.828
But... we can do this another time.

16:13.829 --> 16:15.397
Are those doughnuts?

16:15.398 --> 16:16.898
Bagels.

16:16.899 --> 16:18.500
That'll do.

16:18.501 --> 16:22.270
JAY: We're already using "Welcome
to <i>the Arctic research community"</i>

16:22.271 --> 16:24.673
to say, "Don't even think
about drilling up there."

16:24.674 --> 16:26.675
But you really want to
try to implicate Russia

16:26.676 --> 16:29.611
- for letting them in, on top of that?
- Just a whiff of it.

16:29.612 --> 16:31.079
Something like, um,

16:31.080 --> 16:35.550
"Protecting the diplomatic integrity of...

16:35.551 --> 16:38.620
"the Arctic is the chief objective

16:38.621 --> 16:41.623
"of the Arctic Council
and the United States.

16:41.624 --> 16:45.660
So, you know, don't try
anything with Russia."

16:45.661 --> 16:49.331
First of all, Russia's almost
as territorial as China is.

16:49.332 --> 16:51.333
There's no way they're gonna share

16:51.334 --> 16:53.101
all their new shipping lanes
with another superpower

16:53.102 --> 16:55.770
- once the polar ice cap melts.
- I know, right? Total fiction.

16:55.771 --> 16:58.173
Can I ask why we're ringing that bell?

16:58.174 --> 17:01.109
I'm told it'll play well.

17:01.110 --> 17:02.210
You're just in time.

17:02.211 --> 17:03.578
He's introducing Henry.

17:03.579 --> 17:06.881
Madam Secretary, I am so sorry.

17:06.882 --> 17:08.415
Oh, no.

17:08.416 --> 17:13.488
The photo that was sent with
the query has appeared online.

17:13.489 --> 17:14.189
Where?

17:14.190 --> 17:15.156
For the moment,

17:15.156 --> 17:16.858
a user-generated news site.

17:16.858 --> 17:18.425
Relatively low-profile.

17:18.426 --> 17:21.496
All of the other photos
are still under wraps.

17:21.497 --> 17:22.964
But now that word's out...

17:22.964 --> 17:25.333
DAISY: It's only a matter of
time till someone buys the rest.

17:25.334 --> 17:27.234
There has to be something we can do.

17:27.236 --> 17:29.604
NADINE: Well, I've reached out
to Russell Jackson's office.

17:29.605 --> 17:31.840
We can move your afternoon commitments

17:31.841 --> 17:33.410
and make a task force.

17:33.411 --> 17:35.369
Let's not change the schedule.
The president wants everything

17:35.370 --> 17:37.812
- to move forward as usual.
- It might be best

17:37.813 --> 17:41.049
to reschedule the meet and greet
with the Royal Kumari of Nepal.

17:41.050 --> 17:42.317
Why's that?

17:42.318 --> 17:45.120
Um...

17:45.121 --> 17:49.858
it's a devoutly religious country.

17:49.859 --> 17:51.726
She's a virgin goddess.

17:51.727 --> 17:54.029
Well, let's just hope

17:54.030 --> 17:57.132
the prepubescent virgin
goddess who lives in a temple

17:57.133 --> 18:00.468
doesn't spend much time on the Internet.

18:00.469 --> 18:01.903
The meeting stays.

18:01.904 --> 18:04.072
HOST: There really is so
much to mine, isn't there,

18:04.073 --> 18:06.741
in this liminal border
between the Christian

18:06.742 --> 18:08.176
and the Muslim worlds.

18:08.177 --> 18:10.178
Well, it's precisely the
blurriness in this moment

18:10.179 --> 18:11.980
of transition where we can see

18:11.981 --> 18:15.116
the common sources behind so much

18:15.117 --> 18:17.619
of our cultural and spiritual conflict.

18:17.620 --> 18:19.988
Mm. Like stumbling onto
a wealth of scrolls

18:19.989 --> 18:21.690
preserved in a cave.

18:21.691 --> 18:23.458
Well, sure, yeah.

18:23.459 --> 18:26.061
Why don't we open things
up to our callers?

18:26.062 --> 18:28.129
- Jeff from Fair Oaks.
- JEFF: Yes, hi.

18:28.130 --> 18:29.964
Go ahead with Dr. Henry McCord.

18:29.965 --> 18:31.166
Hi, Jeff.

18:31.167 --> 18:32.934
JEFF: Uh, I've been listening to you talk

18:32.935 --> 18:34.636
about the moral codes of Christianity

18:34.637 --> 18:36.538
and Islam. And I think
it's so interesting

18:36.539 --> 18:38.707
that you hold yourself up
as an expert on morality

18:38.708 --> 18:41.543
when all I'm finding online
about you is a photo

18:41.544 --> 18:43.111
of your daughter rolling around in bed

18:43.112 --> 18:45.380
- with the president's son.
- Excuse me?

18:45.381 --> 18:47.716
- I'm sorry. Uh, Jeff, we lost our conne...
- No, no, let me finish.

18:47.717 --> 18:50.085
Is that your definition of
moral parenting, Dr. McCord?

18:50.086 --> 18:53.221
- Is that your definition?
- No, no, I'd like to answer that.

18:53.222 --> 18:54.854
You ask an interesting question, Jeff.

18:54.855 --> 18:56.491
I'd like to start by making a distinction

18:56.492 --> 18:58.126
that I usually make
on the very first day

18:58.127 --> 19:00.028
of my Morals and Ethics class.

19:00.029 --> 19:02.664
A lot of people say that
morals are how we treat

19:02.665 --> 19:04.733
the people we know and
ethics are how we treat

19:04.734 --> 19:05.867
the people we don't know.

19:05.868 --> 19:08.903
So morals are what
make us a good parent,

19:08.904 --> 19:11.072
a good friend, a nice neighbor.

19:11.073 --> 19:13.408
But ethics are how we build a society.

19:13.409 --> 19:16.611
That's the true test of our higher self.

19:16.612 --> 19:19.414
But what happens, Jeff,
when society is ruled

19:19.415 --> 19:23.051
by the subjective morals of, say, you

19:23.052 --> 19:25.220
and your family and you
choose to project that

19:25.221 --> 19:28.089
onto complete strangers is that
we all end up with a society

19:28.090 --> 19:29.724
that's governed by self-aggrandizement.

19:29.725 --> 19:31.493
- So, really, by calling
- Oh...

19:31.494 --> 19:33.128
to make sure you're the
first little pedant to jump

19:33.129 --> 19:35.630
off your chair and teach me a lesson

19:35.631 --> 19:37.599
with smug superiority about

19:37.600 --> 19:39.300
your own particular moral point of view

19:39.301 --> 19:41.269
when you know precisely
nothing of the situation,

19:41.270 --> 19:43.404
you've done your part to contribute

19:43.405 --> 19:46.541
to the erosion of our
entire social fabric.

19:46.542 --> 19:47.942
Pat yourself

19:47.943 --> 19:49.677
on the back. Bravo.

19:49.678 --> 19:52.180
HOST: Uh, so we are...
going to take a break.

19:52.181 --> 19:54.748
I'm gonna go make some calls.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:03.010 --> 20:05.879
- Do I want to know how bad it is?
- It's just the one photo.

20:05.880 --> 20:06.914
Somebody leaked it.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.615
The rest are still under wraps.

20:08.616 --> 20:11.218
I mean how bad did I
make things for you?

20:11.219 --> 20:13.620
You're still my hero.

20:13.621 --> 20:15.222
No, I'm not. I went off
like a hopped up undergrad.

20:15.223 --> 20:18.191
You did what I have been wanting to do

20:18.192 --> 20:21.561
all day. Instead, I have
to listen to my staff imply

20:21.562 --> 20:24.765
that I shouldn't be sitting down
with a virgin goddess from Nepal

20:24.766 --> 20:26.199
while my slutty daughter

20:26.200 --> 20:28.702
- is all over the Internet.
- Not you.

20:28.703 --> 20:30.304
You have a meeting with a Kumari?

20:30.305 --> 20:31.939
He knows what a Kumari is.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.140
Don't

20:33.141 --> 20:34.508
ever change.

20:34.509 --> 20:35.275
How old is she?

20:35.276 --> 20:36.476
12. Almost ready

20:36.477 --> 20:38.745
to retire. Okay, I'm getting more

20:38.746 --> 20:41.882
- "bad news" face. Hold on.
- No further news on your daughter, ma'am.

20:41.883 --> 20:44.418
But I just got word from the Hill.
It now looks

20:44.419 --> 20:47.988
like the disaster relief
bill is not going to pass.

20:47.989 --> 20:51.258
(sighs) Henry, I got to go. Bye.

20:51.259 --> 20:54.294
What happened to the Tin Man?
I thought we had the Tin Man.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.496
This morning, when the
president's numbers dropped,

20:56.497 --> 20:57.764
three more senators

20:57.765 --> 20:59.766
took the opportunity
to flip their positions.

20:59.767 --> 21:02.636
Over a photo sex scandal?

21:02.637 --> 21:04.504
The vote will be up again in January.

21:04.505 --> 21:06.673
By which time thousands
of people will have died

21:06.674 --> 21:07.975
of exposure and disease.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.242
Well, at least now

21:09.243 --> 21:10.510
you have a good excuse to cancel

21:10.511 --> 21:12.879
my photo op with the virgin goddess.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.147
The Kumari and

21:14.148 --> 21:16.083
her entourage have already arrived.

21:16.084 --> 21:19.653
I will send the press away
and break the news privately.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.253
No.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.291
I will tell her.

21:24.292 --> 21:26.725
Thank you.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.700
It is an honor, Kumari.

21:33.701 --> 21:36.336
Kumari is pleased to meet
you, Madam Secretary.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.904
We were expecting a bit more press.

21:39.673 --> 21:43.243
I know the honor

21:43.244 --> 21:44.578
of the presence of the Kumari

21:44.579 --> 21:46.179
brought a great deal of attention

21:46.180 --> 21:47.347
to the plight of Nepal

21:47.348 --> 21:50.984
after the terrible
disaster you've endured.

21:50.985 --> 21:53.487
But unfortunately,

21:53.488 --> 21:55.989
support for the additional aid package

21:55.990 --> 21:58.392
will not be approved by the U.S.
Congress today.

21:58.393 --> 22:00.027
That is not what we were led

22:00.028 --> 22:01.728
- to expect.
- The conditions

22:01.729 --> 22:03.762
have changed, unfortunately.

22:04.931 --> 22:09.269
We will revisit the
proposal as soon as we can.

22:09.270 --> 22:12.773
I hope you will accept
my deepest apology

22:12.774 --> 22:16.208
and sympathy for your people.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.715
It is her blessing.

22:41.968 --> 22:43.937
No.

22:43.938 --> 22:46.339
I'm done. No more bad news.

22:46.340 --> 22:50.210
The president has invited
you and Dr. McCord

22:50.211 --> 22:53.413
to join him and the First Lady
for dinner at the White House

22:53.414 --> 22:55.015
this evening.

22:55.016 --> 22:56.249
Is that it?

22:56.250 --> 22:59.352
I can try to find some bad news.

22:59.353 --> 23:00.754
No need.

23:00.755 --> 23:05.157
Pretty sure that dinner
invitation is bad news enough.

23:06.159 --> 23:07.294
What's up?

23:07.295 --> 23:09.328
Would you close the door, please?

23:11.031 --> 23:14.334
So, I'm trying to delete a file

23:14.335 --> 23:16.970
- of old photos...
- Mm-hmm.

23:16.971 --> 23:19.072
...but ever since I
switched to the cloud...

23:19.073 --> 23:21.441
- They keep coming back?
- Like a bad penny.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.410
I've had this.

23:23.411 --> 23:25.312
Okay, let's go to your cloud preferences.

23:25.313 --> 23:26.646
Did that.

23:26.647 --> 23:28.715
Okay, now select the
ones you want to kill.

23:28.716 --> 23:31.116
- Uh...
- Oh. (laughs)

23:32.252 --> 23:34.855
What we're gonna do is, we're
gonna create a ghost file.

23:34.856 --> 23:37.157
- Um...
- I'm not looking, swear.

23:37.158 --> 23:39.426
There's nothing unsavory.

23:39.427 --> 23:42.162
It's just, thought I'd get rid

23:42.163 --> 23:44.030
of the hanging chads... so to speak.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.365
Oh, I get it.

23:45.366 --> 23:48.301
You don't want to be looking
at these things at 2:00 a.m.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.337
after a glass of wine
and too much Adele.

23:50.338 --> 23:52.205
Not that I speak from experience.

23:52.206 --> 23:54.207
Scotch and Joni Mitchell for me.

23:54.208 --> 23:56.276
For what it's worth,

23:56.277 --> 23:59.746
it's only brutal for the first year.

23:59.747 --> 24:01.014
Okay, can I ask?

24:01.015 --> 24:02.616
How can I be his ideal woman,

24:02.617 --> 24:04.317
and five minutes after we break up,

24:04.318 --> 24:05.652
he's dating some barista

24:05.653 --> 24:07.387
who can't even properly use
the possessive apostrophe?

24:07.388 --> 24:09.289
Did you Facebook stalk?

24:09.290 --> 24:11.625
No. A little.

24:11.626 --> 24:14.661
Well, whoever she is,

24:14.662 --> 24:17.230
she's probably very simple

24:17.231 --> 24:19.199
and very needy,

24:19.200 --> 24:21.201
and that's exactly what
he wants right now.

24:21.202 --> 24:23.803
You know you could do the same.

24:23.804 --> 24:26.907
That cyber security guy
clearly has an eye for you.

24:26.908 --> 24:29.543
No, he doesn't. Does he?

24:29.544 --> 24:31.511
So, that's my problem?

24:31.512 --> 24:33.146
I'm not needy enough?

24:33.147 --> 24:35.849
It's in their DNA. They want
to feel like we need them.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.017
You realize

24:37.018 --> 24:39.186
the entire feminist
movement would have us hung

24:39.187 --> 24:40.353
for this conversation.

24:40.354 --> 24:44.224
Well, a fish may not
need a bicycle, but...

24:44.225 --> 24:49.462
Gloria Steinem probably never
spent Saturday night alone

24:49.463 --> 24:51.730
at Bed Bath & Beyond.

24:53.633 --> 24:54.935
Whoa. The good suit, huh?

24:54.936 --> 24:57.037
Oh, I figure, mea culpa
dinner with the president.

24:57.038 --> 25:00.307
- Yeah.
- I don't know that it's <i>your</i> mea culpa.

25:00.308 --> 25:01.875
(shouting): Kids! Pizza!

25:01.876 --> 25:03.276
Don't get me wrong.

25:03.277 --> 25:05.245
That was a spectacular rant, but

25:05.246 --> 25:06.713
I haven't heard any fallout.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.782
So, if a tree falls on C-SPAN,
does it make a sound?

25:08.783 --> 25:09.950
Is that what you're saying?

25:09.951 --> 25:11.418
Ooh, pizza.

25:11.419 --> 25:13.820
Listen, we're going out to the
White House tonight for dinner.

25:13.821 --> 25:16.456
Ooh, Dad's getting called
into the principal's office?

25:16.457 --> 25:17.691
What does that mean?

25:17.692 --> 25:19.259
Please. Your epic TV rant?

25:19.260 --> 25:20.560
What epic rant?

25:20.561 --> 25:22.028
Check it out. Dad's a gif.

25:22.029 --> 25:25.131
You've officially made it.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.499
Great.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.968
Jace, are you okay?

25:27.969 --> 25:30.370
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just sore from practice.

25:30.371 --> 25:33.039
All right, listen, kids, I
don't know how much you know,

25:33.040 --> 25:34.708
but something really
uncool happened to Stevie.

25:34.709 --> 25:36.276
We know. The picture's everywhere.

25:36.277 --> 25:38.311
I just don't see what the big deal is.

25:38.312 --> 25:40.080
Well, the big deal is

25:40.081 --> 25:42.749
that it's a gross invasion of privacy

25:42.750 --> 25:44.751
but, unfortunately, something
that we may have to deal with

25:44.752 --> 25:46.820
'cause our family's in the
public eye and all that.

25:46.821 --> 25:50.023
But we are doing what we can to
keep it from moving forward.

25:50.024 --> 25:51.791
- Okay? Just... yeah.
- Yeah, so just be sensitive, all right?

25:51.792 --> 25:53.193
- ALISON: Of course. Yeah.
- It'll all blow over

25:53.194 --> 25:54.661
as soon as a cooler gif comes along.

25:54.662 --> 25:56.196
- Hey, guys.
- Dude, pizza.

25:56.197 --> 25:57.731
Oh, I'm not doing cheese.

25:57.732 --> 25:59.332
And you're back to vegan.

25:59.333 --> 26:02.269
ELIZABETH: Listen, we're going
out, so you guys are on your own.

26:02.270 --> 26:05.138
Get to bed on time. I
am speaking to you, sir.

26:05.139 --> 26:06.406
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

26:06.407 --> 26:08.707
- Bye.
- Bye, sweets.

26:09.609 --> 26:12.112
Okay, who wants to watch a movie?

26:12.113 --> 26:14.246
- Oh, I'm down.
- Not me.

26:19.286 --> 26:22.822
My mother always insisted that
vichyssoise was only for summer,

26:22.823 --> 26:24.257
but I find it very comforting.

26:24.258 --> 26:26.293
Oh, we could certainly
use a little comfort.

26:26.294 --> 26:27.894
Thank you, Lydia.

26:27.895 --> 26:29.195
HENRY: Again, Conrad,

26:29.196 --> 26:31.164
I am so sorry for losing it today.

26:31.165 --> 26:32.365
We're all on edge.

26:32.366 --> 26:34.401
How's everybody doing at home?

26:34.402 --> 26:35.902
Holding our breath, I'd say.

26:35.903 --> 26:37.671
Any news on who might
have the photographs?

26:37.672 --> 26:40.307
Not yet, which is why
we need to be ready

26:40.308 --> 26:42.676
for this to get worse...
as early as tomorrow.

26:42.677 --> 26:44.878
- That sounds ominous.
- What are you thinking?

26:44.879 --> 26:47.380
Well, we'd, uh, like to
put Stevie and Harrison

26:47.381 --> 26:48.948
on the morning news.

26:48.949 --> 26:50.450
Just a short interview

26:50.451 --> 26:52.385
as a couple. Get out in front of it.

26:52.386 --> 26:53.887
As a couple?

26:53.888 --> 26:55.388
LYDIA: The team thinks it plays

26:55.389 --> 26:58.024
best if we see them as two
young people in love,

26:58.025 --> 26:59.893
regretful for their choices,
but laughing it off.

26:59.894 --> 27:01.761
We'd have to hit just the right tone, but

27:01.762 --> 27:02.962
our people can work with them.

27:02.963 --> 27:05.932
You are aware they broke
up a few weeks ago.

27:05.933 --> 27:07.967
Well, does their relationship
status need to come up, really?

27:07.968 --> 27:09.469
Not if they're posing.

27:09.470 --> 27:11.037
DALTON: This thing has put us

27:11.038 --> 27:12.872
in a tough spot, Bess.

27:12.873 --> 27:14.407
It's a five-minute interview.

27:14.408 --> 27:15.709
Harrison has already agreed.

27:15.710 --> 27:18.244
Of course he has. I'm sorry,

27:18.245 --> 27:20.680
but we all know that Harrison
has nothing to lose.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.782
I mean, at worst he's a recovering addict

27:22.783 --> 27:24.117
with a hot girlfriend.

27:24.118 --> 27:27.153
But Stevie will be the
slut who loses everything.

27:27.154 --> 27:29.389
For crying out loud, Bess,
will you help me solve

27:29.390 --> 27:30.690
one damn problem that you've caused?

27:30.691 --> 27:32.759
HENRY: Okay, Conrad, our
kids took naked pictures

27:32.760 --> 27:33.993
of themselves in bed.

27:33.994 --> 27:35.762
What on earth does that
have to do with Elizabeth?

27:35.763 --> 27:37.197
It's Russia. It's Russia.

27:37.198 --> 27:39.733
I was there when Maria
Ostrov seized power, so,

27:39.734 --> 27:40.934
suddenly, now everything's my fault.

27:40.935 --> 27:42.569
Do we need to bring
matters of state into this?

27:42.570 --> 27:44.270
You opened Pandora's box over there!

27:44.271 --> 27:46.072
Now, I'm Pandora? What'd they do to her?

27:46.073 --> 27:47.774
- Chain her to a rock?
- That was Prometheus.

27:47.775 --> 27:49.008
DALTON: You had to push

27:49.009 --> 27:50.076
your agenda with Ukraine.

27:50.077 --> 27:51.911
- Which almost worked!
- It was too big a risk!

27:51.912 --> 27:54.147
Last I heard, that's why
you brought me in here!

27:54.148 --> 27:55.915
- Guys, we're getting off topic here.
- All I'm saying is

27:55.916 --> 27:57.350
that we need to right the ship.

27:57.351 --> 27:59.119
And I'd love a little cooperation,

27:59.120 --> 28:00.387
for both our kids' sakes.

28:00.388 --> 28:03.590
So, putting Stevie on
national television to apologize

28:03.591 --> 28:06.059
for the horrible crime of being violated...

28:06.060 --> 28:08.161
that's gonna right the
ship, or is she just

28:08.162 --> 28:10.514
apologizing for being sexual?
I'm a little unclear.

28:10.515 --> 28:12.732
LYDIA: No one is going to think
anything less of Stevie.

28:12.733 --> 28:13.933
Well, that's a big relief.

28:13.934 --> 28:16.236
We're just trying to
manage the embarrassment.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.338
Oh, Lydia, I think that ship has sailed.

28:18.339 --> 28:19.739
After your outburst today,
I'd have to agree.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.107
What?

28:21.108 --> 28:23.243
Now we're blaming Henry
for defending his daughter?

28:23.244 --> 28:24.711
Why don't we talk about the fact

28:24.712 --> 28:26.212
that your son has an unsecured phone?

28:26.213 --> 28:27.380
Who'd like another cocktail?

28:27.381 --> 28:29.048
- I would.
- Me.

28:29.049 --> 28:32.452
Well, thank God for Lydia Dalton.

28:32.453 --> 28:35.588
That woman is a first-class WASP.

28:35.589 --> 28:38.291
Never underestimate the
power of gin and denial.

28:38.292 --> 28:39.459
(laughs) You know what?

28:39.460 --> 28:41.661
Actually, I would love a nightcap.

28:41.662 --> 28:44.063
While I write my letter of resignation.

28:44.064 --> 28:45.498
Now, come on!

28:45.499 --> 28:47.367
Conrad doesn't want to lose you.

28:47.368 --> 28:48.868
Just let the dust settle.

28:48.869 --> 28:53.206
Henry, I all but called the
president's son a junkie loser.

28:53.207 --> 28:56.209
STEVIE: Hi.

28:56.210 --> 28:58.978
ELIZABETH: Oh, hey. I didn't

28:58.979 --> 29:01.014
see you there, sweetie....

29:01.015 --> 29:03.016
(sighs)

29:03.017 --> 29:05.585
It's okay. He is a loser.

29:05.586 --> 29:08.087
And for five minutes tomorrow morning,

29:08.088 --> 29:09.989
he will still be my boyfriend.

29:09.990 --> 29:12.025
ELIZABETH: No, sweetie.

29:12.026 --> 29:14.060
You're not gonna do that.

29:14.061 --> 29:16.162
I already told Harrison I would.

29:16.163 --> 29:18.231
No, no. Your mom and I killed it.

29:18.232 --> 29:20.300
They're gonna come up
with another strategy.

29:20.301 --> 29:23.269
I don't want to be strategized,
I don't want to be managed.

29:23.270 --> 29:24.938
I don't even care what's true anymore.

29:24.939 --> 29:26.206
Hey.

29:26.207 --> 29:29.542
One of the feminist groups
on campus made posters of me

29:29.543 --> 29:31.444
like I'm some kind of hero.

29:31.445 --> 29:33.546
And then one of the
fraternities went around

29:33.547 --> 29:36.148
and put "#TeamMcCord" on all of them.

29:36.883 --> 29:39.786
That stupid photo is everywhere.

29:39.787 --> 29:41.321
Dad's losing it on TV,

29:41.322 --> 29:42.856
Jason won't even look at me.

29:42.857 --> 29:45.290
(sighs) I just want my life back.

30:11.284 --> 30:13.685
(groans softly)

30:16.022 --> 30:18.323
(sighs)

30:21.794 --> 30:23.830
I recommend the puzzle.

30:23.831 --> 30:27.233
Well, it's a defense budget proposal.

30:27.234 --> 30:31.704
If this can't put me out, nothing can.

30:31.705 --> 30:34.106
Hmm. (sighs)

30:40.413 --> 30:42.781
Wait a minute.

30:49.452 --> 30:50.623
Oh, hey, Admiral Hill?

30:50.624 --> 30:52.525
Oh, Madam Secretary.

30:52.526 --> 30:54.594
I wonder if I might
get a minute with you

30:54.595 --> 30:56.162
to go over the budget proposal?

30:56.163 --> 30:58.898
I'm still catching up on it
myself, but, yes, of course.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.267
Oh, great. Okay, 'cause
I want to show you.

31:01.268 --> 31:02.869
Right here...

31:02.870 --> 31:04.537
on page 204,

31:04.538 --> 31:07.513
we get into breakdown
on specific weaponry.

31:07.514 --> 31:08.474
Yes.

31:08.475 --> 31:10.443
I know what Sterling said...

31:10.444 --> 31:12.745
that we're looking to go
all stealth and cheap

31:12.746 --> 31:14.213
and fast,

31:14.214 --> 31:16.215
but what is all this?

31:16.216 --> 31:18.751
It's old-school, heavy-duty military gear.

31:18.752 --> 31:22.388
It's-it's aircraft carriers,
tanks, dozens of choppers.

31:22.389 --> 31:25.158
Sterling knows that he has
to sell this to the brass.

31:25.159 --> 31:28.561
And this is what the
generals understand.

31:28.562 --> 31:31.931
But it's more than half the budget.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.701
This old ship turns slowly.

31:34.702 --> 31:36.968
(laughs)

31:38.171 --> 31:40.439
Let me ask you something, Ellen.

31:42.575 --> 31:44.944
You agree with Sterling's initiative?

31:44.945 --> 31:49.782
Do I think that Chinese weather
station is a spy outpost?

31:49.783 --> 31:51.884
Probably not.

31:51.885 --> 31:54.687
But I do think

31:54.688 --> 31:59.057
that this is how wars are going
to be fought in the future.

32:03.062 --> 32:05.363
Thank you, Admiral.

32:06.065 --> 32:08.401
Shakya, I'm glad I caught you.

32:08.402 --> 32:11.304
Could I possibly get two
minutes with the Kumari?

32:11.305 --> 32:12.605
SHAKYA: I'm afraid not,

32:12.606 --> 32:13.906
Madam Secretary. We are just leaving.

32:13.907 --> 32:16.708
Pramila, can I speak
with you for a minute?

32:21.080 --> 32:23.216
I'm sorry.

32:23.217 --> 32:26.451
I want to help your country.

32:30.490 --> 32:31.858
You have one minute.

32:31.859 --> 32:34.159
Thank you.

32:34.894 --> 32:37.229
(door closes)

32:41.100 --> 32:43.903
Pramila, listen to me.

32:43.904 --> 32:46.205
Very soon after you return home,

32:46.206 --> 32:48.541
your time as a Kumari will be finished.

32:48.542 --> 32:50.977
But you still have time
to help your people.

32:50.978 --> 32:54.746
You still have great power,
and I want to help you use it.

32:56.382 --> 32:58.351
Go on.

32:58.352 --> 33:02.088
All I need is your blessing.

33:02.089 --> 33:04.123
If the prime minister comes to you

33:04.124 --> 33:07.960
about a building project in
the Himalayas, smile upon it.

33:07.961 --> 33:10.196
SHAKYA: Madam Secretary,

33:10.197 --> 33:12.031
the Kumari is a divinity.

33:12.032 --> 33:13.366
She does not rule

33:13.367 --> 33:16.105
in matters of state.
{This is not your domain.}

33:16.536 --> 33:17.937
Thank you.

33:17.938 --> 33:20.205
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

33:22.442 --> 33:25.812
You can do a lot more than they say.

33:25.813 --> 33:28.014
Your blessing could save thousands

33:28.015 --> 33:30.315
of lives.

33:46.798 --> 33:50.035
There's my linebacker.
You up for a breakfast burrito?

33:50.036 --> 33:53.271
Nah, just, uh, cereal.
I'm laying off the protein.

33:53.272 --> 33:54.873
Best way to heal sore muscles.

33:54.874 --> 33:56.908
I'm dropping football.

33:56.909 --> 33:58.510
What?

33:58.511 --> 34:00.445
You just made the team,
like, two weeks ago.

34:00.446 --> 34:03.381
I wanted to make friends.
These idiots aren't my friends.

34:03.382 --> 34:06.084
Okay, you're telling me
that there's not a single kid

34:06.085 --> 34:07.752
on that team that's not a jerk?

34:07.753 --> 34:10.487
They made fun of Stevie, Dad,
right in front of my face.

34:10.489 --> 34:11.822
And I did nothing.

34:11.824 --> 34:14.960
Makes me even worse than they are.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.027
You just want to smash' em, right?

34:17.029 --> 34:18.630
Yeah.

34:18.630 --> 34:21.600
Just can't stop thinking about
it, how great it would feel.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.601
Pretty great.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.004
It would for...

34:26.005 --> 34:28.273
maybe an hour.

34:28.274 --> 34:31.309
Here's the thing.

34:31.310 --> 34:34.579
It wouldn't change anything.

34:34.580 --> 34:37.549
And then there's the whole part
about you getting kicked out

34:37.550 --> 34:38.917
of another school for fighting.

34:38.918 --> 34:41.453
So just letting them talk
about Stevie that way,

34:41.454 --> 34:42.721
that's the right thing to do?

34:42.722 --> 34:45.223
Jace, every group you're ever gonna be in

34:45.224 --> 34:47.391
is gonna have at least one jerk.

34:47.393 --> 34:50.695
And you're gonna have to learn
how to deal with them, okay?

34:50.696 --> 34:55.333
Not by quitting and definitely
not by beating anybody up.

34:55.333 --> 34:57.268
Have a burrito.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.803
Take it out on the other team.

35:01.997 --> 35:03.808
I'm sure I'm just being overly cautious,

35:03.809 --> 35:05.521
with all the breaches
that have been happening.

35:05.522 --> 35:06.511
Oh, no.

35:06.512 --> 35:09.781
We like overly cautious.
Uh, where's the zombie file?

35:09.782 --> 35:11.449
Uh, right here.

35:11.450 --> 35:12.884
I've put it in the trash, like, ten times,

35:12.885 --> 35:15.387
- but every time I open the application...
- Right.

35:15.388 --> 35:18.223
So, what we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a ghost file.

35:18.224 --> 35:20.291
Hmm. A "ghost file."

35:20.292 --> 35:21.726
It's kind of surprising...

35:21.727 --> 35:23.962
the press coordinator
of the State Department

35:23.963 --> 35:25.930
doesn't know how to delete
a file from the cloud.

35:25.931 --> 35:28.233
I-I probably could have figured it out,

35:28.234 --> 35:29.801
but I've been <i>really</i>

35:29.802 --> 35:31.436
- busy.
- No, it's cool.

35:31.437 --> 35:34.706
I mean, yeah, I'll go out with you.

35:34.707 --> 35:35.589
(chuckling): Um...

35:35.590 --> 35:37.709
No, we can go to
lunch right now. I've been

35:37.710 --> 35:39.911
working on this awesome
new encryption software,

35:39.912 --> 35:43.081
and I promise to only talk
about it for ten minutes tops.

35:43.082 --> 35:45.383
I think I could be free.

35:45.384 --> 35:48.185
Cool. Shall we?

35:50.889 --> 35:54.426
Just so you know, I knew how to do that.

35:54.427 --> 35:56.794
God, I hope so.

35:58.630 --> 36:00.098
Look who's first to school.

36:00.099 --> 36:03.735
Um, Lucy let me in. I hope
that's okay, Mr. President.

36:03.736 --> 36:05.937
So what's this proposal?

36:05.938 --> 36:09.007
Yeah. Um...

36:09.008 --> 36:12.844
So, in going over the proposed
budget for Craig's military

36:12.845 --> 36:14.846
transformation initiative,

36:14.847 --> 36:17.682
I, uh, saw an opportunity

36:17.683 --> 36:20.952
where I thought State might
be able to contribute, using

36:20.953 --> 36:23.588
our diplomatic relations with Nepal.

36:23.589 --> 36:25.557
I proposed to their prime minister

36:25.558 --> 36:27.759
the idea of an observatory

36:27.760 --> 36:30.095
in the Himalayas. It is

36:30.096 --> 36:32.030
a highly strategic spot for optical,

36:32.031 --> 36:34.199
infrared, and gamma ray observation.

36:34.200 --> 36:37.135
It's strategic, all right. It's
right on the border of China.

36:37.136 --> 36:39.037
Which is why Nepal will
never sign off on it.

36:39.038 --> 36:40.538
They've got a relationship to protect.

36:40.539 --> 36:43.875
They also have needs in the
wake of the earthquakes.

36:43.876 --> 36:45.977
I've gotten word back
from the prime minister

36:45.978 --> 36:47.679
that he's open to the idea,

36:47.680 --> 36:51.216
provided we pay a yearly fee
for use of the land, roughly

36:51.217 --> 36:53.051
the same amount we were hoping to approve

36:53.052 --> 36:54.719
in the disaster relief bill.

36:54.720 --> 36:59.190
The question, of course, is... budget.

36:59.191 --> 37:00.492
(clears throat)

37:00.493 --> 37:03.228
One... Just one second. Um,

37:03.229 --> 37:08.333
for the cost of ten Joint
Light Tactical Vehicles,

37:08.334 --> 37:10.602
we could invest in the peaceful
observation of the heavens

37:10.603 --> 37:12.370
with three new telescopes

37:12.371 --> 37:15.573
and also answer China's
encroachment at the Arctic

37:15.574 --> 37:17.942
with a message of our own.

37:17.943 --> 37:20.178
- Ten JLTVs, huh?
- Yeah.

37:20.179 --> 37:22.781
The budget calls for 400.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.817
I think 390 should do it.

37:25.818 --> 37:27.485
What do you think, Craig?

37:27.486 --> 37:29.287
Well, it's strategic,

37:29.288 --> 37:31.055
it sends a message to China,

37:31.056 --> 37:33.091
and it's cheap.

37:33.092 --> 37:36.059
What's not to like?

37:37.195 --> 37:38.963
Reach out to NASA.

37:38.964 --> 37:39.931
Get it in motion.

37:39.932 --> 37:41.833
Absolutely, Mr. President.

37:41.834 --> 37:45.469
And, Elizabeth, if I
could, uh, get a moment.

37:47.739 --> 37:50.608
Mr. President, I am
sorry about my behavior

37:50.609 --> 37:53.378
last night. It was totally inappropriate.

37:53.379 --> 37:55.046
Lucy,

37:55.047 --> 37:58.148
could you have, uh, Henry come in?

37:59.884 --> 38:02.053
Hello, Conrad.

38:02.054 --> 38:04.055
Hi there.

38:04.056 --> 38:06.558
I wanted to tell you both
that there was a breakthrough

38:06.559 --> 38:08.359
in this photo situation.

38:08.360 --> 38:11.296
The query letter was traced back
to a former Secret Service agent

38:11.297 --> 38:13.498
who was released from duty last month.

38:13.499 --> 38:17.302
Seems this was his, uh,
way to even the score.

38:17.303 --> 38:20.071
So that's it? The photos are contained?

38:20.072 --> 38:22.440
We've stopped the sale of the photos,

38:22.441 --> 38:25.109
and the guy is being held at a
local precinct for questioning.

38:25.110 --> 38:26.778
But we're sure they're gone for good?

38:26.779 --> 38:29.681
As sure as we can be.

38:29.682 --> 38:32.517
I owe you both an apology.

38:32.518 --> 38:35.220
I don't think this situation brought out

38:35.221 --> 38:37.322
the best in a lot of us.

38:37.323 --> 38:39.891
I'm sorry for the way we handled it.

38:39.892 --> 38:42.160
Thanks, Conrad.

38:42.161 --> 38:43.862
May I make a request?

38:43.863 --> 38:44.863
What is it?

38:44.864 --> 38:47.799
Before you finish questioning this guy,

38:47.800 --> 38:51.301
15 minutes alone with him, off the radar.

38:52.036 --> 38:54.805
You got it.

38:59.477 --> 39:02.780
Well, that was very <i>Godfather.</i>

39:02.781 --> 39:05.950
We thinking piano wire or bare hands?

39:05.951 --> 39:09.220
I haven't decided yet.

39:09.221 --> 39:12.590
Is it wrong that I find it kind of hot?

39:12.591 --> 39:15.559
Don't answer that.

39:17.262 --> 39:19.763
(chuckles)

39:25.656 --> 39:27.685
(siren wailing in distance)

39:43.715 --> 39:46.016
You good?

40:03.334 --> 40:05.770
I'm Stephanie.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.405
I'm Ronald Watson.

40:09.107 --> 40:12.143
I don't really know what to say.

40:12.144 --> 40:14.012
I've been having a bad time.

40:14.013 --> 40:16.281
But that's-that's not an excuse.

40:16.282 --> 40:18.316
I heard about your misdemeanor.

40:18.317 --> 40:21.286
I was kind of surprised

40:21.287 --> 40:24.022
that's all you got, actually.

40:24.023 --> 40:26.124
And a fine.

40:26.125 --> 40:29.427
Oh. And a fine.

40:29.428 --> 40:31.329
How much?

40:31.330 --> 40:32.964
$500.

40:32.965 --> 40:35.867
(scoffs)

40:35.868 --> 40:39.370
So that's like, what, half a month's

40:39.371 --> 40:41.506
rent? Or...

40:41.507 --> 40:44.175
a new camera?

40:44.176 --> 40:46.543
You could have taken your own pictures.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.313
I didn't mean to hurt you.

40:51.516 --> 40:53.469
(sighs) So did you not think about that

40:53.470 --> 40:57.364
when you were trying to sell my
privacy to the highest bidder?

40:57.365 --> 40:59.831
Was I just... not real to you?

41:04.905 --> 41:06.372
Elizabeth.

41:06.604 --> 41:09.439
Here we go.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.907
Craig.

41:10.908 --> 41:13.843
I wanted to thank you for
that proposal on Nepal.

41:13.844 --> 41:16.412
Oh, good. I'm glad it found your support.

41:16.413 --> 41:18.915
It's exactly the way we
need to be moving forward.

41:18.916 --> 41:20.583
I'm so glad we're finally finding a way

41:20.584 --> 41:23.618
- to work on the same team.
- Thanks, Craig. Me, too.

41:24.554 --> 41:27.623
Which is why I don't ever
want to hear you say

41:27.624 --> 41:30.091
it's not my turn again.

41:30.993 --> 41:33.328
We should grab that lunch, though.

41:34.063 --> 41:35.798
Absolutely.

41:35.799 --> 41:37.667
Mr. Sterling, that
meeting's in ten minutes.

41:37.668 --> 41:38.935
RONALD: <i>I was mad.</i>

41:38.936 --> 41:41.003
About other things.

41:41.004 --> 41:43.105
Again, it's not an excuse.

41:43.106 --> 41:44.773
I heard that you lost your job.

41:45.575 --> 41:48.845
They said that I was intoxicated on duty.

41:48.846 --> 41:50.713
But I wasn't. I would never do that.

41:50.714 --> 41:54.382
I've worked for three presidents.

41:55.117 --> 41:57.854
Must be hard on your family.

41:57.855 --> 42:01.257
My son's out of the house.

42:01.258 --> 42:03.525
So it's just me now.

42:05.228 --> 42:07.430
How old is he?

42:07.431 --> 42:08.731
He's 20.

42:08.732 --> 42:09.966
Is he in school?

42:09.967 --> 42:14.170
Taking some... time off for the moment.

42:14.171 --> 42:17.372
Look, I don't know what
exactly you want from me.

42:18.407 --> 42:21.444
I don't want anything, Ronald.

42:21.445 --> 42:23.712
We're just talking.

42:24.513 --> 42:28.484
I just wanted to get to
know you as a person.

42:28.485 --> 42:32.121
So I wouldn't...

42:32.122 --> 42:33.990
reduce you

42:33.991 --> 42:36.058
to one stupid thing

42:36.059 --> 42:38.760
that you did.

42:40.363 --> 42:43.665
See how that works?

42:55.344 --> 42:57.679
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:59.181 --> 43:01.851
You okay?

43:01.852 --> 43:03.853
Yeah.

43:03.854 --> 43:06.154
I am.
