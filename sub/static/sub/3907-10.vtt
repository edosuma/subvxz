10:04.021 --> 10:05.386
All right? You're looking at a man.

10:05.481 --> 10:07.688
Well, stop whining about what you don't got.

10:07.775 --> 10:11.142
I mean, God damn,
I can't believe you sitting up there

10:11.236 --> 10:13.693
and you can't appreciate
what the hell I done gave you.

10:13.781 --> 10:17.194
Exactly what the fuck did you give me,
huh, besides heartbreak?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.741
All right? The feeling of being unwanted,
not good enough?

10:19.828 --> 10:22.365
I put that chip on your shoulder, boy.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.867
I gave you that fire in your heart.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.789
Come on, you think I knew my daddy?

10:26.877 --> 10:28.333
Come on, man. Shit.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.797
That motherfucker was gone
before Grandma's head hit the pillow.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.291
And I hated him for it.

10:32.382 --> 10:33.963
But, boy, let me tell you something.

10:34.051 --> 10:39.136
I used that anger the same way that you use
your hatred toward me on the field.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.884
Come on, man.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.135
It's the anger that made me so good.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.718
And you're pretty damn good yourself.
Don't think I ain't noticed.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.063
Look.

10:54.154 --> 10:58.614
If it's props you want, take all my failures.

10:58.951 --> 11:01.408
Take the trouble I get in, the people I hurt.

11:02.204 --> 11:05.287
You didn't leave us for me, to help me.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.502
Oh.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.503
-I'm a coward.
-You're a bitch-ass coward.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.626
And that's all you ever been.

11:18.554 --> 11:21.091
Let me tell you something, young blood.

11:22.266 --> 11:25.850
Me and you both, we done laid ourself out
between them lines.

11:25.936 --> 11:29.303
We got cornerbacks, we got safeties,
all wanting to put our lights out.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.184

Yeah. Well, they also travel in flocks,
like you do.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.388
That means they're loyal.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.887
Safety in number protects them
from their predators.

12:07.978 --> 12:11.766

just wasn't cool.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.199
-What did I miss?
-She's a colleague

14:37.294 --> 14:40.206
and she needed a little bit
of guidance on an investment.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.878

I was trying to lend his departure
just a little bit of dignity.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.063
I offered him a very generous severance.

15:04.154 --> 15:07.738
That didn't prevent him from
acting like a fucking lunatic.

it allows me to appreciate my good fortune.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.382
You like nature, Spencer?

22:34.771 --> 22:36.261
Firing Joe was a mistake.

22:37.232 --> 22:38.893
You gotta let that go, Spencer.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.848
He lives for the job. You can'tjust take it away

22:40.944 --> 22:42.525
because he occasionally
puts his foot in his mouth.

22:42.612 --> 22:46.104
He threatened to shit down my throat
until I choked to death.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.195
-He's passionate.
-He's done.

22:49.285 --> 22:52.072
If you cut Joe loose,
it's gonna jam up our team Chemistry.

like this going, you can't mess with that.

I think that Anderson and Strasmore

23:03.299 --> 23:04.505
make an even better pair.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.253
But Joe and I have that magic.

23:06.427 --> 23:09.760
We have that intangible thing
that comes around once in a lifetime.

23:09.847 --> 23:10.973

All right, I'll bite. Where are we going?

25:09.092 --> 25:12.004
We are going to Anderson 2-point-fucking-O.

25:12.095 --> 25:16.680
He gave us the entire sports division
and he is backing it with $5 million.

25:16.766 --> 25:20.600
And I told him there's no me without you.

25:23.898 --> 25:26.355
-You're making me blush, man.
-You should.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.693
SO I'm unfired?

25:27.777 --> 25:30.189
No, think of it as a promotion.
He's doubling down.

to buy that shit out.

are still fucking hurt.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.874
-due to my wrongful termination.
-Hmm.

And plus I stopped drinking
for nearly 36 hours, man.

-I don't like it.
-No, you shouldn't. I don't blame you.

But would a 39-foot speedboat
make you feel any better?

26:04.814 --> 26:07.556

26:07.650 --> 26:10.813
He gave us a fucking speedboat.

26:10.945 --> 26:12.560
And it's all yours if you want it.

and now I'm being regifted.
