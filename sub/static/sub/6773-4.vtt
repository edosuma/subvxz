WEBVTT

00:05.789 --> 00:09.549
Come on, Twilight. We're gonna be late
for the Nightmare Night Festival.

00:12.549 --> 00:13.480
Huh?

00:14.480 --> 00:15.480
Are you...

00:15.698 --> 00:19.077
...that one creaky grandpa
from Ponyville Retirement Village?

00:20.077 --> 00:22.077
I'm Star Swirl the Bearded.

00:23.504 --> 00:25.071
Father of the omnimorphic spell?

00:27.071 --> 00:30.071
Did you even read that book I gave you
about obscure unicorn history?

00:30.782 --> 00:31.687
Um...

00:32.686 --> 00:33.492
That sounds important!

00:36.492 --> 00:41.492
Nightmare Night! What a fright!
Give us something sweet to bite!

00:43.709 --> 00:46.571
Hi, everypony. Great costumes.

00:46.571 --> 00:48.379
Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith.

00:48.379 --> 00:51.379
I should have been
asleep five hours ago.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:00.644 --> 01:05.275
Pipsqueak the Pirate, at your service.
It's my very first Nightmare Night.

01:05.275 --> 01:07.152
Since you moved here from Trottingham?

01:07.152 --> 01:11.152
No. My very first Nightmare Night ever!

01:11.629 --> 01:13.629
Enough chitchat! Time is candy!

01:13.727 --> 01:16.283
Pinkie Pie, aren't you
a little old for this?

01:16.283 --> 01:18.283
Too old for free candy?

01:18.774 --> 01:19.402
Never!

01:26.402 --> 01:27.402
Do you like it?

01:28.581 --> 01:30.581
Yeah! Great costume, Twilight.

01:30.683 --> 01:33.474
Oh, you make a fantastic weirdo clown.

01:34.474 --> 01:36.055
A clown?!

01:38.055 --> 01:40.055
Look at the borders on these robes.

01:40.364 --> 01:41.364
These are hoof-stitched!

01:41.999 --> 01:43.197
It's a great costume.

01:44.197 --> 01:45.197
...grandpa.

02:26.205 --> 02:30.049
Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most
important conjurer of the pre-classical era.

02:34.049 --> 02:36.049
He created more than two hundred spells.

02:36.479 --> 02:40.479
He even has a shelf in the Canterlot
library of magic named after him.

02:41.938 --> 02:45.372
Maybe I should start up a pony group
to teach ponies of our history.

02:45.372 --> 02:48.372
I bet everypony would love it.
Don't you, Spike?

02:49.955 --> 02:51.786
I love it.

02:52.786 --> 02:54.398
Hey, look. We're here already.

02:54.398 --> 02:55.398
Should we get something to eat?

02:57.896 --> 03:00.489
Twilight! Twilight! Look at our haul!

03:00.489 --> 03:01.298
Can you believe it?

03:05.298 --> 03:08.264
And then we went to Cheerilee's house
and we got a bunch more goodies.

03:08.264 --> 03:09.264
-Didn't we, Pip?
-Sure did!

03:09.693 --> 03:11.167
And then we had to stop and wait
for Granny Smith and...

03:22.688 --> 03:24.150
Look what you did to Spike.

03:26.150 --> 03:27.150
Aw, it's all in good fun.

03:27.590 --> 03:29.590
Oh! Oh! There's another group over there!

03:43.663 --> 03:45.663
Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack.

03:45.684 --> 03:49.169
Howdy, Spike. Hey, Twilight.
Nice costume.

03:49.169 --> 03:51.070
Thanks! I'm a dragon.

03:51.070 --> 03:52.070
She means me, Spike.

03:52.881 --> 03:56.000
With that beard, I reckon you're
some sorta country music singer.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
While y'all are here, you feel like
bobbin' for an apple?

04:06.182 --> 04:07.182
Thank you, everypony.

04:07.900 --> 04:11.280
And welcome to
the Nightmare Night Festival.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.279
Now, all the little ponies, who
have been out collecting sweets...

04:16.331 --> 04:20.331
...should follow our friend Zecora
to hear the legend of...

04:20.735 --> 04:23.735
Nightmare Moooon!

04:25.915 --> 04:29.827
Spooky voice might work better
if she wasn't dressed like that.

04:36.827 --> 04:42.646
Follow me and very soon
You'll hear the tale of Nightmare Moon.

04:44.646 --> 04:49.646
Listen close, my little dears.
I'll tell you where you got your fears.

04:49.685 --> 04:52.685
Of Nightmare Night, so dark and scary.

04:54.690 --> 04:57.271
Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary.

05:01.271 --> 05:06.192
Every year we put on a disguise
To save ourselves from her searching eyes.

05:09.192 --> 05:12.192
The Nightmare Moon wants just one thing:

05:14.463 --> 05:17.463
To gobble up ponies in one quick swing!

05:19.776 --> 05:25.560
Hungrily she soars the sky.
If she sees nopony, she passes by.

05:25.560 --> 05:31.560
So if she comes and all is clear,
Equestria is safe another year!

05:32.644 --> 05:35.064
Um... Miss Zecora.

05:35.064 --> 05:38.064
If we wear costumes to hide
from Nightmare Moon...

05:38.170 --> 05:40.093
...so she won't gobble us up...

05:40.093 --> 05:43.093
...how come we still need to
give her some of our candy?

05:43.398 --> 05:49.398
A perfect question, my little friend!
For Nightmare Moon you must not offend.

05:50.406 --> 05:52.406
Fill up her belly with a treat or two...

05:52.781 --> 05:56.781
So she won't return to come eat YOUUU!

05:58.959 --> 06:01.345
Everypony! Just dump some
candy and get outta here!

06:25.345 --> 06:27.345
IT'S NIGHTMARE MOON! RUUUN!!!

06:56.961 --> 06:58.019
Princess Luna!

07:11.019 --> 07:13.019
CITIZENS OF PONYVILLE!

07:14.363 --> 07:17.363
WE HAVE GRACED YOUR TINY
VILLAGE WITH OUR PRESENCE...

07:17.904 --> 07:23.480
...SO THAT YOU MIGHT BEHOLD
THE REAL PRINCESS OF THE NIGHT!

07:23.480 --> 07:26.480
A CREATURE OF NIGHTMARE IS
NO LONGER, BUT INSTEAD...

07:26.730 --> 07:30.370
...A PONY WHO DESIRES
YOUR LOVE AND ADMIRATION.

07:30.370 --> 07:33.233
TOGETHER WE SHALL CHANGE
THIS DREADFUL CELEBRATION...

07:33.233 --> 07:37.233
...INTO A BRIGHT AND
GLORIOUS FEEEAST!

07:38.819 --> 07:40.009
Did you hear that, everypony?

07:40.009 --> 07:42.009
Nightmare Moon says
she's gonna feast on us all!

07:47.593 --> 07:48.538
What?!

07:48.538 --> 07:53.069
No, children, no! You no longer
have reason to fear us.

07:53.069 --> 07:55.069
Screams of delight is
what your princess desires.

07:55.899 --> 07:58.052
Not screams of terror.

08:00.052 --> 08:01.052
Madame Mayor.

08:01.375 --> 08:04.375
Thy princess of the night hath arrived.

08:11.629 --> 08:13.064
What is the matter with you?

08:17.064 --> 08:19.064
Very well then! Be that way!

08:19.476 --> 08:22.476
We won't even bother with
the traditional royal farewell.

08:23.550 --> 08:25.550
I'm gonna go talk to her.

08:25.733 --> 08:28.228
You can't talk to her!
She's Nightmare Moon!

08:28.228 --> 08:29.228
No, she's not.

08:29.483 --> 08:32.482
I saw the Elements of Harmony
change her back to good.

08:32.582 --> 08:34.582
But it seems like she's having
some trouble adjusting...

08:34.736 --> 08:37.245
...after being gone
for a thousand years.

08:44.245 --> 08:45.245
Princess Luna?

08:46.259 --> 08:47.259
Hi. My name is...

08:47.710 --> 08:49.274
Star Swirl the Bearded.

08:49.274 --> 08:52.273
Commendable costume.
Thou even got the bells right.

08:52.273 --> 08:56.273
Thank you, finally! Somepony
who gets my costume.

08:58.446 --> 09:01.071
Uh... I just came to welcome you
to our celebration.

09:02.071 --> 09:03.071
My actual name is...

09:03.518 --> 09:04.518
Twilight Sparkle.

09:05.523 --> 09:08.481
IT WAS THOU WHO UNLEASHED
THE POWERS OF HARMONY UPON US...

09:08.481 --> 09:10.399
...AND TOOK AWAY OUR DARK POWERS!

09:12.399 --> 09:14.399
And that was a good thing, right?

09:14.740 --> 09:17.384
But of course! We
could not be happier.

09:17.384 --> 09:18.384
Is that not clear?!

09:18.654 --> 09:21.533
Well, you kind of sound
like you're yelling at me.

09:21.533 --> 09:24.533
But this is the traditional
royal Canterlot voice.

09:24.576 --> 09:27.465
It is tradition to speak
using the royal "we"...

09:27.465 --> 09:31.465
...and to use THIS MUCH VOLUME
WHEN ADDRESSING OUR SUBJECTS!

09:34.883 --> 09:38.787
You know, that might explain why
your appearance was met with...

09:38.787 --> 09:40.288
...mixed results.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.288
I think if you just changed
your approach a bit...

09:42.687 --> 09:45.015
...you might be met
with a warmer reception.

09:46.015 --> 09:47.015
CHANGE OUR APPROACH?

09:48.408 --> 09:50.019
Or the volume.

09:50.019 --> 09:53.019
Oh. We have been locked away
for a thousand years.

09:53.534 --> 09:56.168
We are... not sure we can.

09:58.168 --> 10:02.168
Don't worry, princess. Fluttershy
can give you some great pointers.

10:02.260 --> 10:05.260
She's delicate and demure
with the sweetest little voice.

10:06.624 --> 10:09.440
GO AWAY! NO CANDY HERE! VISITORS
NOT WELCOME ON NIGHTMARE NIGHT!

10:11.440 --> 10:13.440
Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!

10:14.474 --> 10:15.474
It is you.

10:16.509 --> 10:17.509
Ah, and Nightmare Moon.

10:18.541 --> 10:19.541
Nightmare Moon?!

10:22.620 --> 10:23.620
Wait right here.

10:28.761 --> 10:32.404
Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?

10:33.404 --> 10:34.404
CHARMED!

10:37.845 --> 10:39.120
Likewise...

10:39.120 --> 10:42.120
TWILIGHT SPARKLE HATH SPOKEN
OF THE SWEETNESS OF THY VOICE.

10:42.496 --> 10:46.496
WE ASK, THOU TEACHEST TO US
TO SPEAK AS THOU SPEAKEST!

10:46.522 --> 10:47.427
Okay...

10:47.427 --> 10:49.035
SHALL OUR LESSONS BEGIN?

10:49.035 --> 10:50.035
Okay...

10:50.155 --> 10:52.025
SHALL WE MIMIC THY VOICE?

10:52.025 --> 10:52.025
Okay...

10:52.801 --> 10:54.293
HOW IS THIS?

10:54.293 --> 10:55.273
Perfect. Lesson over.

10:57.273 --> 10:59.273
A little quieter, princess.

10:59.313 --> 11:01.313
HOW IS... this?

11:01.831 --> 11:03.206
Better. Right, Fluttershy?

11:05.206 --> 11:06.163
Yes.

11:07.163 --> 11:10.163
How... about... now?

11:10.325 --> 11:11.325
Now you're getting it.

11:11.864 --> 11:14.125
And... how about now?

11:14.125 --> 11:15.125
Yes! Well done.

11:17.163 --> 11:19.163
AH, THANK YOU, DEAR FLUTTERSHY!

11:19.519 --> 11:21.494
OUR NORMAL SPEAKING
VOICE SHALL SURELY...

11:21.494 --> 11:24.494
...WIN US THE HEARTS
OF THY FELLOW VILLAGERS.

11:24.524 --> 11:25.524
Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us!

11:25.976 --> 11:27.413
Nightmare Moon is here and...

11:28.413 --> 11:32.154
She stole Fluttershy's voice so she
can't scream when she GOBBLES HER UP!!!

11:35.154 --> 11:37.154
NAY, CHILDREN, WAIT!

11:38.285 --> 11:41.285
I mean... nay, children, wait.

11:42.605 --> 11:45.167
Come on, princess. Time for plan B.

11:57.167 --> 11:59.167
It is of no use, Twilight Sparkle.

11:59.307 --> 12:01.307
They have never liked us
and they never shall.

12:01.874 --> 12:05.096
My friend Applejack is one of the
most likeable ponies around.

12:05.096 --> 12:07.096
I'm sure she'll have some ideas.

12:07.662 --> 12:08.524
Heee...!

12:08.524 --> 12:10.524
Whoop. Careful there, partner.

12:15.582 --> 12:17.373
Uh... Applejack.

12:17.373 --> 12:21.155
The princess is looking for a little
advice on how to fit in around here.

12:21.155 --> 12:23.155
"Fit in"? Really?

12:24.356 --> 12:26.356
I mean... that's easy!

12:26.447 --> 12:28.447
All you gotta do is have
the right attitude.

12:28.734 --> 12:32.714
Loosen up a bit, be positive,
play a few games, have some fun.

12:32.714 --> 12:33.688
Fun?

12:33.688 --> 12:36.688
What is this "fun" thou speakest of?

12:37.923 --> 12:41.144
Pray tell, what purpose do these serve?

12:41.144 --> 12:44.144
Try to land the
sp-sp-spiders on the web.

12:50.193 --> 12:51.061
You can do it, princess!

12:57.061 --> 13:00.061
Ha! Your princess enjoys this... fun.

13:00.285 --> 13:02.285
In what other ways
may we experience it?

13:05.341 --> 13:07.341
Fire away, princess!

13:11.505 --> 13:14.144
Ha ha! The fun has been doubled!

13:16.144 --> 13:17.144
Why don't you try bobbin' for apples?

13:17.878 --> 13:20.503
We got the best apples
in Equestria here, princess.

13:20.503 --> 13:23.503
I ask that thou call us... me...

13:23.852 --> 13:25.852
...Luna, fair Applejack.

13:25.899 --> 13:30.267
Hear me, villagers!
All of you! Call me Luna!

13:32.267 --> 13:34.267
Show me to this bobbing apples.

13:35.422 --> 13:36.422
Whoooa...!

13:38.583 --> 13:40.327
Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip?

13:40.327 --> 13:41.327
We lost him the last time
we had to run...

13:43.456 --> 13:45.264
NIGHTMARE MOON IS
GOBBLING PIPSQUEAK!

13:45.264 --> 13:47.264
EVERYPONY RUUUN!!!

13:49.711 --> 13:53.110
Heeelp! My backside has been gobbled!

13:53.110 --> 13:54.110
'Tis a lie!

13:54.625 --> 13:59.571
Thy backside is whole and ungobbled,
thou ungrateful whelp!

14:02.571 --> 14:05.571
Fair villagers, please do not back away.

14:05.918 --> 14:07.293
Let us join together in...

14:08.293 --> 14:09.293
...fun!

14:14.817 --> 14:18.610
Not enough fun for you?
What say you to this?

14:31.610 --> 14:35.192
Huzzah! How many points do I receive?

14:39.192 --> 14:40.018
Do not run away!

14:43.018 --> 14:45.018
As your princess we command you!

14:54.320 --> 14:57.320
BE STILL!!!

15:02.551 --> 15:05.245
Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!

15:05.245 --> 15:07.245
NO, TWILIGHT SPARKLE!

15:07.464 --> 15:10.464
WE MUST USE THE TRADITIONAL
ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE...

15:10.644 --> 15:12.085
...FOR WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO SAY.

15:14.085 --> 15:17.085
SINCE YOU CHOOSE TO FEAR YOUR PRINCESS
RATHER THAN LOVE HER...

15:17.381 --> 15:20.381
...AND DISHONOR HER WITH THIS
INSULTING CELEBRATION...

15:20.936 --> 15:25.211
...WE DECREE THAT NIGHTMARE
NIGHT SHALL BE CANCELED!

15:25.211 --> 15:27.211
FOREVER!

15:34.869 --> 15:37.589
Shoot. We had everything goin' our way.

15:37.589 --> 15:41.589
Luna was happy, everypony in town
was happy. Now look at 'em.

15:42.778 --> 15:46.778
But I wanted to be a zombie next year!

15:49.822 --> 15:51.448
It's not over yet.

15:51.448 --> 15:52.448
What are you gonna do?

15:52.870 --> 15:55.423
I'm going to do what I do best.

15:55.423 --> 15:56.211
Lecture her!

16:06.211 --> 16:07.211
Princess.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.259
Leave me be, Twilight Sparkle.

16:09.380 --> 16:13.250
Princess. I'm sorry it hasn't
worked out how we wanted.

16:13.250 --> 16:16.250
But you have to believe me when
I tell you that Nightmare Night...

16:16.466 --> 16:19.466
...is one of the most popular
celebrations we have.

16:19.621 --> 16:21.371
Yes. I can tell.

16:21.371 --> 16:25.371
By all the adoring shrieks
of the children as they run away.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.418
Princess.

16:48.418 --> 16:52.033
No! No shrieking. No squealing
or screaming either. Okay?

16:52.033 --> 16:53.033
Okay.

16:53.849 --> 16:55.495
There's something I want you to see.

16:55.495 --> 16:59.129
And I promise that it's safe, but you
really, really, really can't shriek.

16:59.129 --> 17:00.129
Do you promise not to shriek?

17:09.751 --> 17:12.751
Pinkie Pie, you remember
Princess Luna, right?

17:12.862 --> 17:16.828
Ah. The ringleader of the
frightened children.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.606
Hast thou come to make peace?

17:28.606 --> 17:29.082
Nightmare Moon!

17:31.082 --> 17:32.082
Rainbow!

17:37.859 --> 17:41.809
She's changed, Pinkie!
She's not evil or scary anymore!

17:41.809 --> 17:44.809
And she definitely doesn't
want to gobble you up!

17:45.809 --> 17:47.384
Well, duh.

17:47.384 --> 17:48.188
Huh?

17:48.188 --> 17:49.188
I know that. Sheesh, Twilight.

17:49.837 --> 17:52.811
I'm almost as big as her.
How's she gonna gobble me up?

17:52.811 --> 17:55.296
So why do you keep
running away and screaming?

17:55.296 --> 17:58.296
Sometimes it's just
really fun to be scared.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.494
Fun?

18:01.824 --> 18:04.196
Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!

18:04.196 --> 18:05.196
No, I'm not. I'm a chicken.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.750
Princess Luna!
I've finally figured out...

18:08.898 --> 18:11.404
...why you're having
so much trouble being liked!

18:11.404 --> 18:14.404
Forgive me if I withhold my enthusiasm.

18:14.538 --> 18:17.538
Come with me. I'll explain
everything on the way.

18:19.835 --> 18:23.385
Gosh. I never thought my
very first Nightmare Night...

18:23.385 --> 18:25.385
...would be my very last.

18:25.943 --> 18:31.608
Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret.
Nightmare Night's not over yet.

18:31.608 --> 18:37.162
We still have candy left to give,
So Nightmare Moon might let us live.

18:37.162 --> 18:40.101
Yes. Come on, little ponies.

18:40.101 --> 18:43.101
What's Nightmare Night without
the annual candy offering?

18:43.869 --> 18:47.029
You don't want Nightmare Moon
to gobble you up...

18:47.029 --> 18:48.017
...dooo youuu?

18:50.017 --> 18:52.017
Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me.

18:53.573 --> 18:55.114
Come on, kids!
Doesn't that sound like fun?

19:05.114 --> 19:06.114
Goodbye, Nightmare Night.

19:07.281 --> 19:08.281
Forever.

19:10.789 --> 19:12.739
CITIZENS OF PONYVILLE!

19:12.739 --> 19:15.739
YOU WERE WISE TO BRING THIS CANDY TO ME.

19:15.799 --> 19:18.067
I AM PLEASED WITH YOUR OFFERING.

19:18.067 --> 19:20.067
SO PLEASED THAT I MAY JUST EAT IT...

19:20.736 --> 19:23.154
...INSTEAD OF EATING YOU!

19:31.154 --> 19:35.154
I am not certain that did what
you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle.

19:35.630 --> 19:37.461
Just wait.

19:37.461 --> 19:40.458
For what? For... for them
to scream some more?

19:40.458 --> 19:42.458
Um... Princess Luna.

19:42.636 --> 19:45.058
I know there's not gonna be
any more Nightmare Night...

19:46.058 --> 19:49.058
...but do you suppose maybe
you could come back next year...

19:49.432 --> 19:51.432
...and scare us again anyway?

19:52.608 --> 19:55.608
Child. Are thou saying that thou...

19:55.826 --> 19:57.826
...likest me to scare you?

19:57.926 --> 20:01.199
It's really fun! Scary, but fun.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.199
It... is?

20:02.865 --> 20:06.150
Yeah! Nightmare Night is my
favorite night of the year.

20:06.150 --> 20:09.150
Well then. We shall have to bring...

20:09.221 --> 20:11.221
...NIGHTMARE NIGHT BACK!

20:11.999 --> 20:13.329
Whoa!

20:13.329 --> 20:16.329
You're my favorite princess ever!

20:17.490 --> 20:19.467
She said yes, guys!

20:19.467 --> 20:20.467
YAY!

20:20.692 --> 20:23.692
See? They really do like you, princess.

20:23.749 --> 20:25.749
Can it be true?

20:26.901 --> 20:29.595
OH, MOST WONDERFUL OF...

20:29.595 --> 20:31.595
I mean...

20:31.862 --> 20:34.354
Oh, most wonderful of nights.

20:35.354 --> 20:37.210
"Dear Princess Celestia."

20:37.210 --> 20:41.010
"When you first sent me to Ponyville,
I didn't know anything about friendship."

20:41.010 --> 20:44.010
"I met somepony tonight who
was having the same problem..."

20:44.087 --> 20:46.087
"...your sister, Princess Luna."

20:46.476 --> 20:49.231
"She taught me that one of the best
things you can do with friendship..."

20:49.231 --> 20:52.231
"...is to give it to others and
help them find it themselves."

20:52.653 --> 20:55.644
"And I'm happy to report that
all of Ponyville has learned..."

20:55.644 --> 20:59.644
"...that even if somepony seems
a little intimidating, even scary..."

20:59.833 --> 21:04.833
"...when you offer them your friendship,
you'll discover a whole new pony underneath."

21:04.855 --> 21:08.260
"And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded
costume didn't go over..."

21:08.260 --> 21:11.260
"...this still turned out to be
the best Nightmare Night ever."
