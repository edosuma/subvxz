WEBVTT

00:02.863 --> 00:04.445
What are you talking about, Maxine?

00:04.446 --> 00:06.354
Weddings are a beautiful thing.

00:06.355 --> 00:08.432
We get to pretend
we accomplished something,

00:08.433 --> 00:10.601
and all we had to do was not break up.

00:10.602 --> 00:12.203
And your parents pay
for the whole thing.

00:12.204 --> 00:14.705
Her parents are very rich, by the way.

00:14.706 --> 00:16.907
Okay, I like the
commitment of marriage.

00:16.908 --> 00:18.144
I just think weddings are cheesy.

00:18.145 --> 00:19.844
What's wrong with going
down to the courthouse

00:19.845 --> 00:21.256
and just making our lives easier?

00:21.257 --> 00:22.925
A courthouse? Do you
hear this? A courthou...

00:22.926 --> 00:24.593
No, of course weddings are cheesy,

00:24.594 --> 00:26.699
but where else will
my Uncle Pete get a chance

00:26.700 --> 00:29.443
to hit on one of your nieces?

00:29.444 --> 00:31.735
You guys are a funny couple.

00:31.736 --> 00:33.704
Hey, I'm gonna go get
us all another round.

00:33.705 --> 00:35.472
No, no, no. I'll get this one.

00:35.474 --> 00:37.541
No, stop. Are you kidding?
It's your anniversary.

00:37.542 --> 00:38.876
I'm getting the drinks.

00:38.877 --> 00:41.679
Okay. Thank you, Jessica!

00:41.680 --> 00:44.949
Maxine, that girl wants
to have sex with us.

00:44.950 --> 00:47.918
What? Jerrod, you're insane.

00:47.919 --> 00:51.021
She came over, approached us,
started a conversation,

00:51.022 --> 00:53.424
laughed at everything we
said for over an hour.

00:53.425 --> 00:55.025
She's getting us drunk.

00:55.026 --> 00:57.561
Like, if I were single,
I would've already invited her

00:57.562 --> 01:00.431
back to my place to watch Westworld.

01:00.432 --> 01:02.433
I think it's possible for someone

01:02.434 --> 01:04.034
to be friendly without wanting sex.

01:04.035 --> 01:06.036
No, it isn't.
That's all friendliness is.

01:06.037 --> 01:08.439
It's just horniness in disguise,
trust me.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.474
That girl wants to sleep with us.

01:11.910 --> 01:14.511
Huh.

01:14.513 --> 01:16.614
I... find that kind of flattering.

01:17.222 --> 01:18.117
I like the idea

01:18.118 --> 01:20.480
of being the couple that people
want to have sex with.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.682
Like George and Amal or...

01:22.683 --> 01:25.351
Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.385
What?

01:26.386 --> 01:27.947
Nobody wants to have a threesome

01:27.948 --> 01:29.496
with Goldie Hawn
and Kurt Russell anymore.

01:29.497 --> 01:30.741
What are you talking about?

01:30.742 --> 01:31.970
Well, I think they're classy.

01:31.971 --> 01:33.864
Like Michael Douglas
and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

01:33.865 --> 01:35.032
Okay, quit naming old couples, Maxine.

01:35.033 --> 01:36.071
You're creeping me out.

01:36.635 --> 01:38.970
Look, the point is, if this is real,

01:38.971 --> 01:40.905
what are we gonna do about it?

01:42.674 --> 01:45.042
- I don't know.
- I mean...

01:45.043 --> 01:46.544
you've said in the past

01:46.545 --> 01:48.546
that you'd be open to us
trying a threesome.

01:48.547 --> 01:50.915
And it's fallen in our lap on
our three-year anniversary.

01:50.916 --> 01:54.452
I don't think we can get a
much clearer sign from God.

01:54.453 --> 01:57.154
I mean, it is something
I've fantasized about.

01:57.155 --> 01:59.724
And you're sure it's something
that you still want to try?

01:59.725 --> 02:03.694
More than I want my father to
live to see his grandchildren.

02:03.695 --> 02:06.664
I don't even know why
we're talking about this,

02:06.665 --> 02:08.132
because you're just
interpreting it all wrong.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.033
She's just a friendly person.

02:10.035 --> 02:11.055
Okay, here, she's coming back.

02:11.056 --> 02:12.503
- Don't make it weird.
- I'm not gonna...

02:12.504 --> 02:13.871
Okay, here we go.

02:13.872 --> 02:16.674
- Thanks.
- Oh, thank you so much, Jessica.

02:16.675 --> 02:20.811
You know, you have, like,
really beautiful eyes.

02:23.482 --> 02:25.583
Oh. Thank you.

02:25.584 --> 02:27.084
You know...

02:27.085 --> 02:29.520
Jessica...

02:29.521 --> 02:31.789
if I may speak for my fiancÃ©e and I,

02:31.790 --> 02:34.859
we think your eyes are beautiful, too.

02:43.602 --> 02:47.104
Oh. Wow. Um...

02:57.849 --> 03:01.018
Hey, Jessica, you ever seen Westworld?

03:19.075 --> 03:21.623
Happy anniversary.

03:21.624 --> 03:24.730
Last night was... amazing.

03:24.731 --> 03:26.264
It was incredible, right?

03:26.265 --> 03:28.263
Every couple should have a threesome.

03:28.264 --> 03:29.931
I've never felt more in sync with you.

03:29.932 --> 03:31.800
Mm-hmm.

03:31.801 --> 03:33.468
I'm not gonna lie.

03:33.469 --> 03:34.970
Really proud of the
work I did in there.

03:34.971 --> 03:37.505
I mean...

03:37.506 --> 03:39.341
it was overwhelming for a second,

03:39.342 --> 03:41.643
but it's good to know that
in a fight-or-flight situation,

03:41.644 --> 03:45.213
your boy here spars
with the best of them.

03:45.214 --> 03:46.514
Yeah, I feel like we can accomplish

03:46.515 --> 03:48.149
anything together now.

03:48.150 --> 03:50.251
You know, if they had group
sex at corporate retreats,

03:50.252 --> 03:52.287
I bet company productivity
would skyrocket.

03:53.622 --> 03:55.790
After last night, I think
you finally passed Jay Z

03:55.791 --> 03:58.293
as the most important person
in the world to me.

04:01.030 --> 04:03.665
Yeah, no, and I was like,
"Well, this is a grocery store.

04:03.666 --> 04:05.633
You're supposed to have the bags."

04:06.669 --> 04:10.038
Hey, why is she still here?

04:10.039 --> 04:11.539
Yeah, it's almost noon; it's like,

04:11.540 --> 04:14.075
how long are you supposed
to stay after a threesome?

04:14.076 --> 04:16.644
It was clearly a one-night stand.

04:16.644 --> 04:17.478
Everybody knows the rules.

04:17.480 --> 04:19.380
As soon as the sun hits your face,

04:19.382 --> 04:22.016
you're supposed to get out
of there like a vampire.

04:23.619 --> 04:25.053
Hey, Jessica.

04:25.054 --> 04:26.254
Good morning.

04:26.255 --> 04:28.623
Well, that was a really fun night.

04:28.624 --> 04:31.326
Oh! Oh...

04:31.327 --> 04:33.061
Oh.

04:34.063 --> 04:37.165
Okay.

04:37.166 --> 04:39.634
Hey, do you guys
have an extra toothbrush?

04:39.635 --> 04:41.302
What?

04:41.303 --> 04:42.937
Uh, yeah, there should be one, uh,

04:42.938 --> 04:44.239
in the cabinet under the sink.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.874
Okay, thanks.

04:45.875 --> 04:49.177
And when I get out,
we can finally watch Westworld.

04:51.380 --> 04:54.049
How long do you think
she's gonna stay here?

04:54.050 --> 04:56.084
She's brushing her teeth
while wearing my shirt.

04:56.085 --> 04:58.987
I think she's planning on dying here.

04:58.988 --> 05:00.859
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

05:00.860 --> 05:02.524
When she gets out,
I'm just gonna tell her

05:02.525 --> 05:04.325
that I got an emergency
text from my sister,

05:04.326 --> 05:06.161
and we have to go pick her up

05:06.162 --> 05:07.495
from her abusive boyfriend's house.

05:07.496 --> 05:09.197
Well, what if she wants
to come with us?

05:09.198 --> 05:10.431
Who would want to come to that?

05:10.433 --> 05:12.167
Uh, everyone.

05:12.168 --> 05:14.102
Do you know how
interesting that sounds?

05:14.103 --> 05:15.692
If someone told me
they were about to go

05:15.693 --> 05:17.138
to their sister's house
who'd just been abused,

05:17.139 --> 05:18.840
I'd drop all my plans
and get in the car.

05:18.841 --> 05:21.376
Now, look, I'm just gonna
tell her to get out.

05:21.377 --> 05:22.812
No, you can't do that.

05:22.813 --> 05:24.479
We have to come up with
the right thing to say

05:24.480 --> 05:26.181
so that she leaves but she doesn't,

05:26.182 --> 05:28.149
you know, feel hurt by it.

05:28.150 --> 05:30.785
Okay, you know, I'm just
gonna tell her that

05:30.786 --> 05:32.153
I forgot we already had plans.

05:32.154 --> 05:33.154
Eh.

05:33.231 --> 05:36.091
Just a heads up,
your toothbrushes are medium,

05:36.092 --> 05:38.326
but most dentists
actually recommend soft.

05:38.327 --> 05:40.261
It's easier on your gums.

05:40.262 --> 05:43.798
Oh, yeah, I've been meaning
to get soft toothbrushes.

05:43.799 --> 05:45.133
Uh...

05:46.001 --> 05:47.669
Oh, crap!

05:47.670 --> 05:50.371
Jerrod, I forgot that we have to go get

05:50.372 --> 05:51.639
our couple's massage

05:51.640 --> 05:54.042
at the spa because
it's our anniversary.

05:54.043 --> 05:55.843
Oh, what spa?

05:57.646 --> 05:59.047
Oh, it's, um...

05:59.048 --> 06:00.782
What's it called?

06:00.783 --> 06:02.117
Look, Maxine's lying to you.

06:02.118 --> 06:03.685
The truth is

06:03.686 --> 06:05.220
we only wanted to have sex with you,

06:05.221 --> 06:06.988
and we don't want to hang out anymore,

06:06.989 --> 06:09.257
so we would prefer it if you left.

06:09.258 --> 06:11.092
Cool?

06:12.128 --> 06:14.896
What? Jerrod, what the
hell is your problem?

06:14.897 --> 06:16.731
I am so sorry, Jessica.

06:16.732 --> 06:18.199
We do not feel that way at all.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.001
We had an amazing time
with you last night,

06:20.002 --> 06:21.636
and no one's telling you to leave.

06:21.637 --> 06:23.104
Nah.

06:23.105 --> 06:24.572
She's just saying that.

06:24.573 --> 06:26.908
We really would like for you to leave.

06:26.909 --> 06:28.610
Cool?

06:30.146 --> 06:34.682
Wow. Um, I'm sorry
I overstayed my welcome.

06:34.683 --> 06:36.217
No, don't be so hard on yourself.

06:36.218 --> 06:38.520
We're new to threesomes, too, you know?

06:38.521 --> 06:40.622
We're just figuring out
all these crazy rules

06:40.623 --> 06:42.724
as we go along, you know?

06:47.730 --> 06:50.465
Okay. Yeah, I guess I'll leave.

06:55.704 --> 06:57.705
Westworld time!

06:57.706 --> 06:59.707
Jerrod, how can you
be so inconsiderate?

06:59.708 --> 07:01.009
She was so hurt.

07:01.010 --> 07:02.677
No, she seemed fine.

07:02.678 --> 07:04.546
Okay, how would you feel
if you had sex with someone

07:04.547 --> 07:06.548
and then they kicked you out
first thing in the morning?

07:06.549 --> 07:07.715
Amazing.

07:07.716 --> 07:08.783
Maxine,

07:09.059 --> 07:11.019
honesty is way better than
stringing someone along.

07:11.020 --> 07:12.887
We kicked her out early enough for her

07:12.888 --> 07:14.722
to still enjoy the rest of her day.

07:14.723 --> 07:16.082
What is it, like, noon?

07:16.083 --> 07:17.825
She could still catch a
matinÃ©e if she wants to,

07:17.826 --> 07:19.427
and those are half off tickets.

07:19.428 --> 07:21.496
We're saving this girl time and money.

07:21.497 --> 07:23.665
Oh, don't act like you
did something noble.

07:23.666 --> 07:25.934
Nobody likes that kind
of brutal honesty.

07:25.935 --> 07:27.936
Lying after sex is just
common human decency.

07:27.937 --> 07:29.704
Okay.

07:29.705 --> 07:31.906
Maxine, let's not
fight about her, okay?

07:31.907 --> 07:33.608
If there's a lesson to be learned here,

07:33.609 --> 07:36.311
it's that we are just way
too much fun as a couple.

07:36.312 --> 07:38.079
People are gonna get attached.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.514
I bet this is what it's like

07:39.515 --> 07:41.783
when Barack and Michelle
have threesomes.

07:41.784 --> 07:44.752
You threw her out like trash.

07:44.753 --> 07:46.721
No, I didn't. I recycled her.

07:46.722 --> 07:47.922
I-I put her back

07:48.409 --> 07:50.658
into the world so she could
have a new beginning.

07:50.659 --> 07:52.660
Happy anniversary!

07:52.661 --> 07:54.696
No, do not answer the door.

07:54.697 --> 07:56.331
I cannot deal with
your family right now.

07:56.332 --> 07:58.399
I can't not answer the door.
They're at the door.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.835
Hey, Jerrod, you home?
Maybe they're not home.

08:00.836 --> 08:02.904
Well, where else would they be?

08:02.905 --> 08:06.307
They're always over our place
or here; they got no lives.

08:06.308 --> 08:08.276
Jerrod, you're being rude as hell.

08:08.277 --> 08:11.279
Now, I'm gonna kick this
door down if I need to.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.181
Five, four...

08:13.782 --> 08:17.685
Happy anniversary!

08:17.686 --> 08:19.821
Took y'all long enough.

08:19.822 --> 08:21.723
Look at you two.

08:21.724 --> 08:24.559
Still in your bathrobes.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.362
Well, that must have
been a wild night, huh?

08:27.363 --> 08:28.896
- Huh?! Huh?!
- All right.

08:28.897 --> 08:31.432
Okay, okay. All right.
Okay. Please stop.

08:33.202 --> 08:36.203
Of course, the real anniversary
comes after you get married,

08:36.205 --> 08:37.672
but you kids

08:37.673 --> 08:41.676
and your new ways, celebrating
dating anniversaries.

08:41.677 --> 08:44.345
I just hope you get right with God.

08:44.346 --> 08:47.548
Soon, before you have
to go to hell forever.

08:49.018 --> 08:51.452
But congratulations!

08:51.453 --> 08:53.521
So, look, we went to the Pottery Barn,

08:53.522 --> 08:56.658
and we got his and her
Egyptian cotton towels.

08:56.659 --> 08:58.693
Feel it. Uh-huh.

08:58.694 --> 09:00.428
That's how they dry their ass in Egypt.

09:00.429 --> 09:02.096
It's nice, right?

09:04.366 --> 09:06.234
Well, thank you, guys.

09:06.235 --> 09:07.435
I'm gonna be in the bedroom.

09:07.436 --> 09:08.603
Jerrod, we'll finish this later.

09:08.604 --> 09:10.204
Hold on.

09:10.205 --> 09:12.540
I think I know what's happening here.

09:12.541 --> 09:15.410
We walked in on a little
anniversary fight.

09:15.411 --> 09:17.211
The most beautiful fight of the year.

09:18.814 --> 09:21.549
You know, Jerrod was conceived
after a anniversary fight.

09:21.550 --> 09:23.351
See, when a man is angry,

09:23.352 --> 09:26.354
that's when he's at his most potent.

09:26.355 --> 09:27.555
Judging from the anger I'm looking at

09:27.556 --> 09:29.223
on y'all's faces,

09:29.224 --> 09:31.626
we might be grandparents
in nine months.

09:36.065 --> 09:37.365
Sorry, I just...

09:37.366 --> 09:38.399
Well, who is this?

09:38.400 --> 09:40.168
Oh, hey, hey.

09:40.169 --> 09:42.103
It's not actually a good time.
My parents came by, so...

09:42.104 --> 09:43.404
I left my bra, okay?

09:43.405 --> 09:45.640
Just give it to me and I'll leave.

09:46.241 --> 09:48.242
"Bra"?

09:48.243 --> 09:50.278
Did she just say "bra"?

09:50.279 --> 09:52.313
Yeah, I heard "bra," Mama.

09:52.314 --> 09:54.048
You did say "bra," right, lady?

09:54.049 --> 09:55.149
Hey, okay.

09:56.118 --> 09:58.118
Look, just wait right there.
I'll go grab it, okay?

10:02.224 --> 10:05.193
Hi, Jessica.

10:05.194 --> 10:07.361
Hi.

10:10.733 --> 10:14.035
So, uh...

10:14.036 --> 10:16.838
did y'all have a little
sleepover or something?

10:21.710 --> 10:24.345
Yeah, something like that.

10:24.346 --> 10:26.914
Oh, so you're visiting
from out of state?

10:26.915 --> 10:28.249
No.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.251
Okay.

10:30.252 --> 10:33.120
Here you go. Thanks for coming by.

10:33.122 --> 10:34.722
Bye. This isn't my bra.

10:34.723 --> 10:36.057
Oh, God. Jerrod, that is mine.

10:36.058 --> 10:38.226
I'm... Oh, here. Thank you. Okay.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.967
So, uh, y'all went to
high school together?

10:45.968 --> 10:47.135
No.

10:47.136 --> 10:50.037
Okay.

10:50.038 --> 10:52.840
Jerrod got a shirt just like that.

10:55.511 --> 10:57.011
Um, here.

10:57.012 --> 10:58.279
Thanks.

11:02.017 --> 11:07.188
Yo, something went down,
and we're gonna figure it out.

11:10.092 --> 11:12.093
I know, because I've been wearing bras

11:12.094 --> 11:13.861
since before you boys were born,

11:13.862 --> 11:16.898
and I have never
forgotten one somewhere.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.901
It just seems impolite

11:19.902 --> 11:23.171
to be taking off your bra
at your friend's house.

11:23.172 --> 11:25.873
Yeah, if I take my drawers off
at a friend's house,

11:25.874 --> 11:28.509
that means something
horrible has happened.

11:29.912 --> 11:31.746
This is very peculiar.

11:31.747 --> 11:34.382
Okay, there's nothing suspicious, okay?

11:34.383 --> 11:36.851
Stop trying to figure something out.

11:36.852 --> 11:39.687
So...

11:39.688 --> 11:41.489
a girl stayed over,

11:41.490 --> 11:45.526
and she left her bra in y'all bedroom,

11:45.527 --> 11:48.896
and then there's a lot
of tension in the air.

11:50.466 --> 11:51.933
It's pretty clear what went down.

11:51.934 --> 11:55.036
Well, what did you deduce, Bobby?

11:55.037 --> 11:58.406
Jerrod and Maxine had
a threesome last night.

11:58.407 --> 11:59.540
A threesome?!

11:59.541 --> 12:01.742
Oh, my God.

12:01.743 --> 12:04.779
I solved the case.

12:05.644 --> 12:07.604
Let me get this straight.

12:07.605 --> 12:10.140
Y'all had an orgy last night?

12:11.614 --> 12:14.001
Let's not make a big deal
about this, okay?

12:14.002 --> 12:15.269
Well, I'm having conflicted feelings.

12:15.270 --> 12:18.406
On the one hand, I'm proud of my son,

12:18.407 --> 12:21.935
and on the other hand,
I'm very disappointed in Maxine.

12:22.642 --> 12:26.445
Man, this double standard thing
between men and women is real.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.114
Can we please just drop this?

12:28.115 --> 12:31.984
You're always trying to
steal my thunder, Jerrod.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.719
Look, I was just about
to break the news

12:33.720 --> 12:36.388
that I finally slept
with an Asian chick.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.558
But, no, Jerrod got to have it all.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.796
God, I did not wake up
this morning thinking

12:43.797 --> 12:45.931
I would find out that my boy

12:45.932 --> 12:48.701
is engaged to a lesbian.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.671
This does not make me a lesbian.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.106
Are you sure, Maxine?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.975
'Cause sometimes being a lesbian

12:55.976 --> 12:58.577
can lay dormant
in your system for years,

12:58.578 --> 13:01.270
then it can come back
on you out of nowhere,

13:01.271 --> 13:03.379
like an acid flashback.

13:08.722 --> 13:11.724
Maxine, is this one
of those silly things

13:11.725 --> 13:15.528
where you're trying to prove
how open-minded you are?

13:15.529 --> 13:18.998
Last week, you tried the vegan diet.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.495
This week, you've been
with another woman.

13:22.496 --> 13:24.964
You need to pick out your identity

13:24.965 --> 13:26.565
and stick with it!

13:27.801 --> 13:29.569
Jerrod?

13:29.570 --> 13:31.370
I can't control what they say.

13:32.973 --> 13:37.877
So, y'all had a threesome on
your three-year anniversary.

13:37.878 --> 13:41.280
So, on the fourth, is it
gonna be four people?

13:41.281 --> 13:43.282
Or what if you're together
as long as Mom and Dad?

13:43.283 --> 13:46.052
35 people?

13:46.053 --> 13:47.887
When does it end?!

13:47.888 --> 13:49.221
All right.

13:49.223 --> 13:51.891
Everybody, get out of my apartment!

13:51.892 --> 13:54.260
- Joe, what's happening?
- She allowed to do that?

13:54.261 --> 13:55.761
Maxine.

13:55.762 --> 13:59.031
I liked you better when
you were straight!

13:59.032 --> 14:02.201
And, Jerrod, I'm taking these towels.

14:02.202 --> 14:03.870
And you'll never know what it's like

14:03.871 --> 14:05.805
to dry your ass like an Egyptian.

14:08.041 --> 14:10.643
Then I guess I know
when I'm not wanted.

14:10.644 --> 14:13.079
Jerrod, congratulations
on your threesome.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.047
I couldn't be more proud of you

14:15.048 --> 14:18.651
if you were the first Carmichael
to graduate from college.

14:18.652 --> 14:21.187
And, Maxine...

14:21.188 --> 14:23.122
shameful day all around.

14:27.861 --> 14:29.729
Maxine, what's that about?

14:29.730 --> 14:31.430
You can't just throw my parents out.

14:31.431 --> 14:32.798
Oh, well, maybe I wouldn't have to

14:32.799 --> 14:34.200
if you would just stand up for me.

14:34.201 --> 14:35.501
What does that mean?

14:35.502 --> 14:37.236
Maxine.

14:37.237 --> 14:40.506
What's wrong? Come on.
Come on, talk to me.

14:40.507 --> 14:42.508
Look, I'm not a traditional woman

14:42.509 --> 14:43.976
who wants some big church wedding,

14:43.977 --> 14:45.945
I'm not sure that I ever want kids,

14:45.946 --> 14:48.481
and I will never have
dinner waiting for you

14:48.482 --> 14:51.550
when you get home, but I do want
you to just come to my rescue

14:51.551 --> 14:52.952
every once in a while.

14:52.953 --> 14:55.655
Like, when your parents
call me a whore.

14:55.656 --> 14:58.557
That would be a great time
for you to step up for me.

14:58.558 --> 15:00.493
No one used that exact word.

15:00.494 --> 15:02.061
Jerrod, look, you...

15:02.062 --> 15:04.030
you challenge me intellectually,

15:04.031 --> 15:07.033
and you push me to try new
things and you make me laugh,

15:07.034 --> 15:09.702
but, my God, are you bad with feelings.

15:09.703 --> 15:11.404
And it's fine if you want to pretend

15:11.405 --> 15:13.406
like you don't have any, but I do.

15:13.407 --> 15:15.341
And I need you to think about them.

15:15.342 --> 15:17.576
And I don't want to have
to tell you to do that.

15:17.577 --> 15:19.378
Maxine, here's something that

15:19.379 --> 15:21.280
I don't think you realize about me:

15:21.281 --> 15:23.883
I am not a good boyfriend, okay?

15:23.884 --> 15:25.785
It doesn't mean that I don't love you.

15:25.786 --> 15:28.387
It just means that, uh, I'm bad at it.

15:28.388 --> 15:30.656
Jerrod, you're not
gonna get out of this

15:30.657 --> 15:32.625
by trying to get me
to lower my expectations.

15:32.626 --> 15:34.627
I mean, why would I have
agreed to marry you?

15:34.628 --> 15:36.595
Why would I stay in a
relationship like that?

15:36.596 --> 15:40.366
I don't think you will... okay?

15:40.367 --> 15:43.502
And, I don't know,
sometimes that scares me.

15:43.503 --> 15:45.237
Wait.

15:45.238 --> 15:47.340
You think that I'm gonna
break up with you? Why?

15:47.341 --> 15:48.674
Because I'm not a good boyfriend.

15:48.675 --> 15:51.243
Isn't that what this
whole fight is about?

15:51.244 --> 15:53.179
Well, maybe if you would
just be a good boyfriend,

15:53.180 --> 15:55.114
you wouldn't have to be worried
about me breaking up with you.

15:55.115 --> 15:57.350
Well, we are in a real
chicken-or-egg situation here,

15:57.351 --> 15:58.818
aren't we, Maxine?

16:00.020 --> 16:03.089
Look, you are a caring, compassionate,

16:03.090 --> 16:05.391
loving person.

16:05.392 --> 16:07.426
When you want to be.

16:07.427 --> 16:09.195
No, I'm not.

16:09.196 --> 16:11.197
I'm beginning to worry that
you don't know who I am.

16:11.198 --> 16:12.498
Oh, God, yes, you are!

16:12.499 --> 16:14.366
I mean, Jerrod, I saw
that person last night.

16:14.368 --> 16:15.801
We were so in sync.

16:15.802 --> 16:17.837
You knew everything that I wanted.

16:17.838 --> 16:19.872
I mean, midway through, you just went

16:19.873 --> 16:21.540
and got me a bottle of sparkling water.

16:21.541 --> 16:23.509
Yeah, 'cause I could
tell you were thirsty.

16:23.510 --> 16:25.444
And I was, and you knew that.

16:25.445 --> 16:27.246
And, see, this is what
I'm talking about.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.848
Yeah, but that's different, Maxine.

16:28.849 --> 16:31.383
A threesome is a very
fragile, delicate situation.

16:31.385 --> 16:33.386
If I weren't attentive
to all your needs,

16:33.387 --> 16:35.554
that whole thing could've fallen apart.

16:35.555 --> 16:39.492
So, why not be that guy all the time?

16:39.493 --> 16:41.260
Huh.

16:44.965 --> 16:49.435
So you want me to live every day

16:49.436 --> 16:52.304
like we're in the
middle of a threesome?

16:52.305 --> 16:54.840
If that's the only way
for you to understand

16:54.841 --> 16:56.742
how to be a loving,
compassionate person

16:56.743 --> 16:58.210
who thinks about my feelings,

16:58.211 --> 17:00.346
then, yeah,
that's what I'm trying to say.

17:00.347 --> 17:02.648
Okay, no, no, I hear you,
Maxine, I hear you.

17:02.649 --> 17:04.916
So, what you're saying
is that this relationship

17:04.917 --> 17:07.853
isn't just about me.

17:09.455 --> 17:10.789
Yes.

17:10.790 --> 17:12.558
And you're saying that I should, like,

17:12.559 --> 17:14.126
pay attention to your needs,

17:14.127 --> 17:16.494
even in, like, regular,
everyday situations.

17:16.496 --> 17:18.164
Yes.

17:18.165 --> 17:20.566
I really hope these aren't
completely new thoughts for you.

17:20.567 --> 17:21.800
You know what, Maxine?

17:21.801 --> 17:23.569
Come with me to my parents' house.

17:23.569 --> 17:25.471
I need to go stand up for you.

17:25.472 --> 17:27.606
I should've done that from
the beginning, but I'm gonna

17:27.607 --> 17:28.941
show them another side of me.

17:28.942 --> 17:32.411
I'm gonna show them Threesome Jerrod.

17:32.412 --> 17:35.047
Boy, this analogy
is really sticking, huh?

17:35.048 --> 17:37.583
Yeah, it's really clearing
a lot of stuff up for me.

17:37.584 --> 17:39.585
Oh. Maxine, let's go.

17:39.586 --> 17:41.620
But wear something nice 'cause
we got to make a stop first.

17:41.621 --> 17:44.957
But I promise it's gonna be
romantic and really spontaneous.

17:44.958 --> 17:47.159
Where are we going?

17:47.160 --> 17:50.462
All right, you guys,
sit down and listen up.

17:51.364 --> 17:54.633
You guys insulted Maxine,
and you can't do that, okay?

17:54.634 --> 17:55.935
Because she has feelings,

17:55.936 --> 17:57.970
and her feelings are
connected to my feelings.

17:57.971 --> 17:59.738
I love this girl.

17:59.739 --> 18:01.774
Last night, she gave me a threesome.

18:01.775 --> 18:04.477
Do you know what that means to me?

18:04.478 --> 18:06.078
That means everything to me.

18:06.079 --> 18:09.715
Jerrod, why do you keep
bringing up this threesome?

18:09.716 --> 18:12.685
I am your mother. This is disgusting.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.387
Well, I'm feeling badly.

18:15.388 --> 18:19.258
Maybe I took it a little too far
when I called Maxine a lesbian

18:19.259 --> 18:21.894
and implied that she
was a ho and whatnot.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.763
We cool?

18:24.764 --> 18:26.432
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Joe, okay.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.067
Jerrod, tell them the other thing.

18:28.068 --> 18:29.668
Oh, yeah, that's right, my bad.

18:29.669 --> 18:31.137
Maxine and I got married.

18:31.138 --> 18:33.272
We just did it at the courthouse.

18:35.108 --> 18:37.576
You got married?!

18:37.577 --> 18:39.712
At the courthouse, no wedding?!

18:39.713 --> 18:43.516
Nope. My partner in threesomes
has become my partner in life.

18:43.517 --> 18:45.718
Now give us back our towels!

18:46.686 --> 18:48.721
Now, Dad, Mom...

18:48.722 --> 18:50.356
No!

18:51.992 --> 18:55.161
Look, I consider myself
pretty progressive,

18:55.162 --> 18:58.264
but what you guys have done
in the last 12 hours is insane.

18:58.265 --> 19:00.499
But hold on, now. Did y'all
really get married?

19:00.500 --> 19:02.234
Yeah. Turns out all you got to do

19:02.235 --> 19:04.336
is pay $60 and sign something.

19:04.337 --> 19:07.239
Yeah. I'm Maxine North-Carmichael.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.508
You hyphenated?

19:09.509 --> 19:12.945
Lord, even your name is a threesome!

19:14.514 --> 19:18.584
Well, this is not the way I
expected my son to get married,

19:18.585 --> 19:20.586
but regardless, I'm happy.

19:20.587 --> 19:23.022
All right, everybody, bring it in.

19:23.023 --> 19:24.490
Welcome to the family, Maxine.

19:24.491 --> 19:25.791
Aw, thank you.

19:25.792 --> 19:27.193
Cynthia, come on, bring it in now.

19:27.194 --> 19:30.563
Why? So y'all can try
and have sex with me, too?

19:30.564 --> 19:32.898
No, thank you!

19:32.899 --> 19:34.967
Well, look,

19:34.968 --> 19:37.036
after yesterday's threesome,

19:37.037 --> 19:39.906
y'all wedding night is really
gonna be a disappointment.

19:46.775 --> 19:48.564
So...

19:49.988 --> 19:52.941
does a threesome last twice as long

19:52.942 --> 19:55.444
or half as long?

19:55.445 --> 19:57.856
I'm not giving you any details, Bobby.

19:57.857 --> 19:59.525
This is my wife we're talking about.

19:59.526 --> 20:02.027
Did you do the thing
where you, you know,

20:02.028 --> 20:03.395
you, like, grab the leg...

20:03.396 --> 20:05.664
Okay, you know what, Bobby?

20:05.665 --> 20:07.566
Everything that you're
imagining we did,

20:07.567 --> 20:09.602
we did, twice.

20:09.603 --> 20:11.937
I hate you.

20:13.306 --> 20:14.473
What?

20:14.474 --> 20:17.376
Look, sorry, I can't help it
but to sound resentful.

20:17.377 --> 20:19.044
But let me ask you something.

20:20.614 --> 20:22.414
Is it weird

20:22.415 --> 20:26.485
that I can't stop picturing
my brother having sex?

20:26.486 --> 20:29.421
Yes. Yes, it is weird, Bobby.

20:29.422 --> 20:31.457
Is it even weirder

20:31.458 --> 20:34.960
that I don't want to stop picturing it?

20:34.961 --> 20:37.663
Please leave my apartment.

20:39.165 --> 20:40.566
Fine!

20:40.567 --> 20:43.035
I don't need this.

20:44.871 --> 20:46.372
You know something?

20:46.373 --> 20:48.440
I bet you haven't pictured one time

20:48.441 --> 20:50.609
me having sex with that Asian chick.

20:52.345 --> 20:54.918
And you know why?
It's because you're selfish!
