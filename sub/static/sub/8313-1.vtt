02:29.113 --> 02:31.408
Like most living creatures,

02:31.467 --> 02:36.843
the pigeon quickly associates
the pressing of a lever with reward.

02:36.943 --> 02:40.493
But when a timer releases the seal
automatically every 20 seconds,

02:40.593 --> 02:42.593
the pigeon wonders,

02:42.883 --> 02:45.603
'What did I do to deserve this?'

02:46.974 --> 02:49.288
If it was flapping its wings at the time,

02:49.388 --> 02:52.617
it will continue to flap
convinced that its actions...

02:52.717 --> 02:55.956
...have a decisive
influence on what happens.

02:56.056 --> 02:59.736
We call this 'pigeon superstition.'

03:06.158 --> 03:10.066
MR. NOBODY

03:12.998 --> 03:15.548
What did I do to deserve this?

04:29.204 --> 04:32.604
How's it been going since the last time?

04:37.700 --> 04:42.530
Do I know you?
- We see each other every week.

04:43.886 --> 04:46.123
I'm Dr. Feldheim.

04:47.456 --> 04:50.753
And who are you?
- Nobody.

04:50.959 --> 04:52.744
Nemo Nobody.

04:52.844 --> 04:56.048
That's an unusual name,
don't you think?

04:56.148 --> 04:59.880
Sometimes,
people call me Mr. Craft.

04:59.915 --> 05:01.308
Who?

05:01.408 --> 05:05.176
C-R-A-F-T.

05:06.183 --> 05:09.833
Can't Remember A Fucking Thing.

05:15.737 --> 05:19.137
What was the first question I asked you?

05:20.844 --> 05:24.839
I don't know.
- Can you tell me how old you are?

05:25.624 --> 05:28.096
I'm 34.

05:28.627 --> 05:32.652
I was born in 1975.

05:32.687 --> 05:35.832
Would you mind looking at your hands?

05:36.745 --> 05:40.060
You don't have to if you don't want to.

05:41.835 --> 05:44.640
There's a mirror in front of you.

05:48.083 --> 05:50.083
No. I...

05:50.283 --> 05:52.283
What year is this?

05:53.210 --> 05:55.210
2009.

05:56.326 --> 05:58.327
I'm 34.

05:59.111 --> 06:04.420
I was born February 9th, 1975.

06:05.066 --> 06:10.107
So I guess, it must be your birthday.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.268
I'm 34.

06:24.924 --> 06:27.632
I'm 34.

06:30.001 --> 06:32.120
I've got to wake up.

06:32.953 --> 06:35.307
I've got to wake up.

06:54.085 --> 06:57.618
Don't, Nemo.
Sun hurts my eyes.

07:49.586 --> 07:51.586
Hey, buddy.

07:53.136 --> 07:56.096
Good morning, my little angels.

07:56.690 --> 07:59.751
Time for school, okay?
- Hmm.

08:00.102 --> 08:01.411
Come on.

08:01.511 --> 08:04.996
Elise, I'm gonna take the kids to school.

08:26.054 --> 08:29.454
Paul, keep it down.
- My name's not Paul.

08:31.182 --> 08:33.182
Paul?

08:35.526 --> 08:37.526
Daddy...

08:37.773 --> 08:39.773
Daddy...

08:41.192 --> 08:43.192
Daddy...

08:44.248 --> 08:46.713
Paul, don't wake your father.

08:49.075 --> 08:51.075
Elise.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.360
It's me, Jean.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.267
Am I dead?
- Go back and play Paul.

08:59.405 --> 09:03.878
Who's Elise?
- I don't know anyone called Elise.

09:04.762 --> 09:07.363
You're so tired, Nemo.
You need to rest.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.159
I'll turn the television on for you.

09:09.259 --> 09:11.259
I'm going inside...

09:11.404 --> 09:14.347
The sun hurts my eyes.
- What?

09:15.236 --> 09:17.944
The sun hurts my eyes.

09:30.216 --> 09:33.468
Nemo, your friends are here.

09:47.159 --> 09:49.159
Hello, Nemo.

09:50.139 --> 09:52.351
How are you feeling today?

09:55.874 --> 09:58.330
Do you know who I am?

10:02.038 --> 10:05.353
We're all very worried about you, Nemo.

10:06.158 --> 10:10.068
Everyone wants you be
back in the office soon.

10:30.133 --> 10:32.133
Mrs. Nobody.

10:55.293 --> 10:57.333
This is Julian Marshall.

10:57.483 --> 10:59.553
Live from New New York hospital,

10:59.653 --> 11:04.487
where we're going to see the final episode
in our series, 'The Last Mortals'

11:04.587 --> 11:11.018
Mr. Nobody is 117 years old
and he has not been telemorized.

11:11.040 --> 11:16.565
Nor does he have one of these
marvelous stem-cell compatible pigs.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.498
Live on WWB,

11:20.498 --> 11:25.989
Mr. Nobody will be the last man
on Earth to die of old-age.

11:26.913 --> 11:29.670
Mr. Nobody...
- The Last Mortal.

11:29.670 --> 11:31.670
The last mortal.

11:48.694 --> 11:50.221
Now, Doctor,

11:50.321 --> 11:53.533
no trace of his identity has been
found on the National Records.

11:53.633 --> 11:56.442
Nothing about his past.

11:56.443 --> 11:58.550
We do not know who Mr. Nobody is.

11:58.650 --> 11:59.897
Neither does he.

11:59.997 --> 12:02.340
Our patient's memories are confused,

12:02.440 --> 12:05.718
but it is not unusual
at his certain stage of illness...

12:05.818 --> 12:10.323
...for very old memories
to re-emerge in great detail.

12:10.937 --> 12:13.056
Let's try something new.

12:14.305 --> 12:16.667
I'm thinking of an old technique.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.969
I can't promise anything.

12:19.153 --> 12:22.553
Maybe snatches of memory will come back.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.086
Maybe nothing will happen.

12:25.941 --> 12:27.942
Are you willing to try?

12:36.009 --> 12:38.600
You are very relaxed.

12:40.373 --> 12:43.081
You hear only my voice.

12:44.001 --> 12:47.414
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

12:47.558 --> 12:51.796
Your arms and legs are getting heavy.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.486
I'm going to count to three.

12:56.717 --> 12:58.718
When I say three...

13:00.841 --> 13:02.961
...you will be asleep.

13:03.835 --> 13:05.835
One.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.855
Two.

13:11.611 --> 13:14.554
Remember the day you came here.

13:19.988 --> 13:21.988
Three.

13:22.436 --> 13:24.436
You're sleeping.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.588
SLEEP.......

14:07.530 --> 14:11.179
Remember even further back.

14:11.526 --> 14:13.526
When I say three...

14:14.124 --> 14:16.124
One...

14:16.400 --> 14:18.400
Two...

14:19.244 --> 14:21.244
Three.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.040
Remember.

14:28.853 --> 14:32.032
I can remember a long time ago...

14:32.149 --> 14:34.149
Long before my birth.

14:38.982 --> 14:42.977
I was whizzing with those
who were not yet born.

14:47.398 --> 14:50.505
When we're not born yet,
we know everything.

14:50.605 --> 14:53.155
Everything that's will happen.

15:22.645 --> 15:23.809
When it's your time,

15:23.909 --> 15:27.307
the angels of Oblivion
place a finger on your mouth.

15:27.407 --> 15:29.407
Shh.

15:29.563 --> 15:32.453
It leaves a mark on the upper lip.

15:33.295 --> 15:36.950
It means that
you have forgotten everything.

15:38.039 --> 15:40.629
But the angels missed me.

15:49.043 --> 15:52.364
Then you have to find
a daddy and a mummy.

15:52.464 --> 15:54.504
It's not easy to choose.

15:54.534 --> 15:57.811
Blond and blue eyed.
It's all I'm asking.

15:57.911 --> 15:58.791
Andrew.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.984
It would be nice to the little one
not to be all alone.

16:01.084 --> 16:02.187
You stay here.

16:02.287 --> 16:05.344
It's normal to think about babies
when you reach a certain age.

16:05.444 --> 16:06.660
Well, for women at least.

16:06.760 --> 16:10.233
It's the meaning of life...
- Of life. I had not finished yet, darling.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.613
It's the meaning of life.

16:11.713 --> 16:14.093
It's not that we want a kid.

16:14.426 --> 16:16.154
But we slept together.

16:16.254 --> 16:19.617
It's an important experience.
- It's an important experience, yeah.

16:19.717 --> 16:22.958
I think it would help my husband
if we had a child.

16:23.058 --> 16:26.033
We'd call him George.
Right, George?

16:26.150 --> 16:28.360
We had a dog, but he died.

16:44.195 --> 16:49.343
In the end, I chose them
because the lady smelled nice...

16:49.378 --> 16:50.569
...and the man said...

16:50.669 --> 16:53.389
Well, I can tell you how we met.

16:53.567 --> 16:58.497
It was meant to be.
Have you heard of the Butterfly Effect?

17:55.892 --> 17:59.707
Once upon a time,
there was a daddy and a mommy...

17:59.807 --> 18:02.399
...named 'The Daddy' and 'The Mommy'.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.376
They found a cute little baby...

18:04.476 --> 18:07.475
...and called it 'The Cute Little Baby'.

18:07.575 --> 18:09.847
The little baby was born there.

18:09.947 --> 18:12.587
He was born that day,
and not another.

18:12.687 --> 18:16.537
His daddy and his mummy
live at number seven.

18:16.619 --> 18:19.562
Everything you see exists.

18:19.982 --> 18:21.982
We can see it.

18:22.561 --> 18:27.030
I can see Mummy's eyes.
But I can't see my eyes.

18:27.065 --> 18:33.270
The little baby can see his hands,
but he can not see himself.

18:33.288 --> 18:36.520
So, does he really exist?

18:36.521 --> 18:38.521
Do I really exist?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.509
Boo.

18:44.838 --> 18:46.537
Boo.

18:46.637 --> 18:49.174
# Eenie meenie minie mo #...

18:49.209 --> 18:51.482
...# Catch a baby by the toe #...

18:51.582 --> 18:53.832
...# If he squeals let him go #...

18:53.932 --> 18:56.567
...# Eenie meenie minie mo #...

18:56.852 --> 19:00.119
...# My mother told me
to pick the very best one #...

19:00.219 --> 19:03.952
...# And you are it #

19:11.139 --> 19:16.436
The Mummy has a brush for her hair
and lipstick for her lips.

19:16.437 --> 19:18.198
She smells good.

19:18.298 --> 19:21.731
The Daddy has a watch and hair in his arm.

19:21.831 --> 19:24.376
The watch goes 'tick-tock'.

19:24.418 --> 19:28.656
If the baby falls,
the mother claps her hands.

19:28.742 --> 19:30.744
She says, 'Bravo.'

19:30.745 --> 19:32.745
Bravo.

19:41.863 --> 19:45.159
Why am I me,
and not someone else?

19:56.116 --> 20:00.560
And so, high fresher fronts
moving in tomorrow.

20:00.595 --> 20:03.135
It will bring clear skies
for the whole weekend.

20:03.235 --> 20:06.026
So, get those barbecues out.

20:19.195 --> 20:21.195
Hello.

20:21.961 --> 20:25.845
Why do we remember the past,
but not the future?

20:25.945 --> 20:28.854
When you ask Mummy,
she says,

20:28.898 --> 20:31.069
'Stop asking why.'
- Stop asking why.

20:31.169 --> 20:34.399
'It's complicated.'
- It's complicated.

20:42.583 --> 20:44.583
Yes.

20:52.572 --> 20:55.987
It's okay,
I'm--I'm a journalist.

20:57.456 --> 21:03.831
The hospital won't allow interviews.
I just like to ask you a few questions.

21:04.761 --> 21:08.543
A friend of mine's a nurse here.
She helped me get in.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.644
What time is it?

21:11.951 --> 21:13.951
14:12.

21:15.363 --> 21:17.147
Where did you get that?

21:17.247 --> 21:20.732
I borrowed it from the University Museum.

21:20.825 --> 21:22.697
But it still works.

21:22.797 --> 21:25.504
I've got nothing to say to you.

21:25.698 --> 21:28.524
I'm...
- I'm Mr. Nobody.

21:28.525 --> 21:30.842
The man who doesn't exist.

21:32.124 --> 21:36.172
Do you remember what the world was like
before quasi-immortality?

21:36.272 --> 21:38.980
What?
- Telemorization.

21:39.812 --> 21:41.937
Endless renewal of cells.

21:42.960 --> 21:46.375
What was it like
when humans were mortal?

21:47.357 --> 21:50.654
There were cars that polluted.

21:51.266 --> 21:56.564
We smoked cigarettes.
We ate meat.

21:56.860 --> 22:02.511
We did everything we can do
in this dump and it was wonderful.

22:02.512 --> 22:07.857
Most of the time,
nothing happened...

22:08.814 --> 22:11.523
...like a French movie.

22:13.166 --> 22:17.454
And sexually?
Before sex became obsolete?

22:20.995 --> 22:22.995
We screwed.

22:24.127 --> 22:27.188
Everybody was always screwing.

22:30.059 --> 22:32.059
We fell in love.

22:33.471 --> 22:35.825
We fell in love.

22:42.208 --> 22:44.210
What time is it?

22:46.771 --> 22:49.280
What was there before the Big Bang?

22:49.380 --> 22:50.569
Well, you see,

22:50.669 --> 22:54.054
there was no before because
before the Big Bang,

22:54.154 --> 22:56.193
Time did not exist

22:56.228 --> 23:00.838
Time is a result of
the expansion of Universe itself,

23:00.873 --> 23:04.217
but what will happen when
the Universe has finished expanding...

23:04.317 --> 23:05.785
...and the movement is reversed?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.760
What will be the nature of time?

23:07.860 --> 23:09.777
If String Theory is correct,

23:09.877 --> 23:13.582
the Universe possesses
nine spatial dimensions,

23:13.682 --> 23:15.609
and one temporal dimension.

23:15.709 --> 23:18.322
Now we can imagine that in the beginning,

23:18.422 --> 23:20.831
all the dimensions were twisted together...

23:20.931 --> 23:23.152
...and during the Big Bang,
three spatial dimensions,

23:23.252 --> 23:25.991
the ones that we know as
height, width and depth,

23:26.091 --> 23:30.355
and one temporal dimension,
what we know as time, were deployed.

23:30.455 --> 23:34.541
The other six remained miniscule,
wound up together.

23:34.641 --> 23:38.324
Now, if we live in a Universe
of wound dimensions,

23:38.424 --> 23:41.144
how do we distinguish between...

23:41.504 --> 23:43.623
...illusion and reality?

23:43.951 --> 23:47.874
Time, as we know it, is
a dimension we experience...

23:47.974 --> 23:49.967
...only in one direction.

23:50.067 --> 23:53.882
But what if one of the additional
dimensions wasn't spatial,

23:53.982 --> 23:55.982
but temporal?

23:56.115 --> 23:59.647
If you mix the mashed potatoes and sauce,

23:59.729 --> 24:04.320
you can't separate them later.
It's forever.

24:04.346 --> 24:06.986
The smoke comes out of Daddy's cigarette,

24:07.086 --> 24:09.405
but it never goes back in.

24:14.727 --> 24:16.846
We cannot go back.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.175
That's why it's hard to choose.

24:22.672 --> 24:25.733
You have to make the right choice.

24:29.523 --> 24:35.527
As long as you don't choose,
everything remains possible.

24:44.343 --> 24:46.815
Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Anna.

24:46.834 --> 24:50.098
Hi, Nemo.
- Hello, Elise.

24:50.133 --> 24:52.343
Hello, Nemo.
- Hello, Jean.

24:55.565 --> 25:00.190
For as much as Anna and Nemo
have consented together in holy wedlock,

25:00.290 --> 25:03.691
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company.

25:03.791 --> 25:08.399
For as much as Elise and Nemo have
consented together in holy wedlock...

25:08.499 --> 25:12.820
Jean and Nemo have joined themselves...

25:13.244 --> 25:17.664
I pronounce that they be
husband and wife together...

25:18.333 --> 25:23.093
Those who God has joined together,
no one can separate...

25:43.163 --> 25:47.802
Daddy says you can predict exactly
when Mars will be in the sky,

25:47.902 --> 25:49.659
even in 100 years.

25:49.759 --> 25:51.759
But the funny thing is,

25:51.844 --> 25:53.870
that daddy does not know
what will happen to him...

25:53.970 --> 25:56.010
...two minutes from now.

26:59.136 --> 27:01.136
Mama.

27:28.841 --> 27:31.186
That's not possible, no
one knows the future.

27:31.286 --> 27:33.002
That's I, I remember it.

27:33.102 --> 27:35.098
You remember the past, not the future.

27:35.198 --> 27:36.938
Believe me. I can.

27:37.038 --> 27:43.668
Sometimes things happen and I'm feeling
that they have already happened before.

27:45.069 --> 27:47.069
Well, that's deja vu.

27:47.881 --> 27:50.278
It happens to everyone from time to time.

27:50.378 --> 27:52.918
No. It's because of the Angels of Oblivion.

27:53.018 --> 27:56.078
They did not put their finger on me.

28:02.990 --> 28:04.990
Come on.

28:05.969 --> 28:08.560
Get it. Grab on.

28:08.885 --> 28:10.887
One, two...

30:49.793 --> 30:53.611
Should Mr. Nobody be allowed
to die a natural death?

30:53.711 --> 30:59.116
Should his existence be artificially
prolonged? Make your vote now.

30:59.216 --> 31:01.429
Press X for artificial prolongation,

31:01.529 --> 31:05.311
press 0 to let nature run its course.

31:05.424 --> 31:07.569
We'll be back after this.

31:07.570 --> 31:10.326
You too can take a valley vocation on Mars.

31:10.426 --> 31:14.081
Book before the Union
and save 16,000 inits.

32:28.236 --> 32:30.684
Okay, Anna, let's go.

32:44.154 --> 32:48.511
Then, the Daddy and the Mummy
kissed all day long.

33:12.584 --> 33:15.729
So, Nemo, have you made up your mind?

33:16.597 --> 33:22.377
Do you want to come with me?
Or do you want to stay with your father?

34:33.849 --> 34:35.849
Nemo.

35:46.953 --> 35:49.588
I'm sorry,
I-I don't understand.

35:50.725 --> 35:55.145
Did you stay with your father
or go with your mother?

36:03.077 --> 36:08.374
Daddy, is it my fault?
- Of course not.

36:08.794 --> 36:10.794
It's my fault.

36:19.382 --> 36:23.802
I can give you a good deal
on this type of shoe lace.

36:27.970 --> 36:29.970
A very good deal.

36:49.430 --> 36:51.430
Remember.

37:07.043 --> 37:09.044
Remember.

37:13.502 --> 37:14.992
Nemo...

37:15.092 --> 37:17.092
Nemo.

37:20.344 --> 37:22.894
It's time to wake up, darling.

37:38.068 --> 37:42.318
And guess what?
You're going to be late for school.

37:54.704 --> 37:56.704
Nemo, it's me.

38:00.316 --> 38:02.572
I bet you haven't done your homework.

38:02.672 --> 38:04.672
Hurry up and finish.

38:05.564 --> 38:07.780
I invited someone for dinner.

38:07.880 --> 38:11.535
I'm counting on you
to keep your mouth shut.

38:16.300 --> 38:19.361
How was the trip?
- Uh, it was good.

38:19.528 --> 38:25.635
Have you seen some nice apartments?
- I did. I've seen a couple of nice ones.

38:25.735 --> 38:27.911
Nemo, don't stare at people like that.

38:28.011 --> 38:30.328
It's okay.
It's not a problem.

38:30.428 --> 38:32.997
He has a gift for making people
uncomfortable.

38:33.097 --> 38:35.097
It's nothing.

38:35.489 --> 38:38.124
It will happen on a Saturday...

38:38.683 --> 38:42.030
You will be behind the wheel of your car...

38:42.130 --> 38:44.130
You are whistling...

38:47.510 --> 38:50.230
You do not see the crossroads...

38:50.417 --> 38:54.773
All of a sudden,
a train will appear from your left.

38:55.123 --> 38:57.163
And you will be crushed.

39:08.606 --> 39:10.607
You're not funny.

39:11.194 --> 39:14.424
Nemo thinks he can predict the future.

39:15.547 --> 39:19.217
I can. I predicted Dad's accident.

39:19.218 --> 39:22.261
Yeah, I always wonded if you're not
the one who took off the handbrake.

39:22.361 --> 39:26.652
No one can predict the future,
no one knows what's going to happen.

39:26.752 --> 39:28.752
I do.

39:29.061 --> 39:33.158
Well if you could, you'd know
you were going to get that.

39:33.258 --> 39:35.258
I knew you'd say that.

39:47.045 --> 39:49.045
Proud of yourself?

39:50.631 --> 39:54.286
Why you systematically ruin everything I...

39:54.671 --> 39:58.071
Do you think I have a right to live too?

40:07.729 --> 40:12.234
You could've stayed with your
father if you wanted to.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.040
Everyone, please.

40:21.363 --> 40:23.974
I would like to introduce you
a new student in our class.

40:24.074 --> 40:25.625
Her name is Anna.

40:25.725 --> 40:27.578
Please Anna, take a seat.

40:27.678 --> 40:30.700
Alright,
let's turn to page 215.

40:30.735 --> 40:32.431
It's last night's reading.

40:32.531 --> 40:35.483
We're going to talk about
climate and vegetation zones...

40:35.583 --> 40:39.171
...and the elements of weather
that are involved in each of both zones.

40:39.271 --> 40:43.150
There are five elements that
make up weather as we know it.

40:43.250 --> 40:45.250
Atmosphere pressure...

41:01.602 --> 41:03.602
You're going to swim?

41:04.844 --> 41:07.904
Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I...

41:08.912 --> 41:12.652
Come swim with us.
They're my friends, c'mon.

41:12.692 --> 41:14.692
They're idiots.

41:15.088 --> 41:18.148
And I don't go swimming with idiots.

41:20.884 --> 41:22.884
Jerk.

41:32.116 --> 41:37.297
What on Earth made me say,
'I don't go swimming with idiots'?

41:50.463 --> 41:51.799
Anna.

41:51.899 --> 41:53.276
Nemo.

41:53.376 --> 41:55.376
Yeah.

41:55.694 --> 41:57.694
How have you been?

41:58.022 --> 41:59.190
I'm fine.

41:59.290 --> 42:01.290
How are you?

42:01.382 --> 42:03.382
Yeah, good.

42:03.609 --> 42:05.609
Are these your kids?

42:06.372 --> 42:08.372
Yeah.

42:14.147 --> 42:16.737
Well, I'll see you around.

42:18.326 --> 42:19.734
Yeah, uh...

42:19.834 --> 42:21.834
I'll see you around.

42:33.071 --> 42:38.251
What on Earth made me say,
'I don't go swimming with idiots'?

43:06.423 --> 43:08.133
You're going to swim?

43:08.233 --> 43:11.293
Come on, the water's nice.
- No, I...

43:15.695 --> 43:17.711
I don't know how to swim.

43:17.811 --> 43:19.811
Sorry?

43:20.503 --> 43:22.628
I don't know how to swim.

43:23.729 --> 43:25.729
That's it.

43:26.565 --> 43:28.690
Please don't tell anyone.

43:30.468 --> 43:32.641
Hey, aren't you gonna swim?

43:32.741 --> 43:35.942
No, I've got my period.
I'm gonna stay here.

43:36.042 --> 43:37.827
Nemo will keep me company.

43:37.927 --> 43:39.927
Okay.

44:08.300 --> 44:13.009
Darling? I... I want to
introduce you to someone.

44:13.193 --> 44:15.566
You've already met Harry.
- Hey.

44:15.666 --> 44:20.416
And this is his daughter, Anna.
Anna, this is Nemo.

44:30.889 --> 44:33.099
Why don't you shake hands?

44:51.903 --> 44:53.903
How was work today?

45:14.080 --> 45:16.788
Ugh, I can't believe them.

45:16.789 --> 45:19.679
Soon as I wonder how old they are.

45:23.009 --> 45:25.174
They already slept together?

45:25.274 --> 45:27.274
I don't know.

45:27.801 --> 45:28.876
I hope they use condoms.

45:28.976 --> 45:32.886
I do not want to end up with a little brother.

45:33.622 --> 45:35.255
I'd rather die.

45:35.355 --> 45:37.355
Is you mom on the pill?

45:38.295 --> 45:40.295
I have no idea.

45:41.092 --> 45:43.403
We should slip it into her morning coffee.

45:43.503 --> 45:47.243
It's like her hormones
have gone to her head.

45:52.139 --> 45:54.774
Sometimes I can see the future.

45:56.743 --> 46:02.693
It doesn't seem like it can be much fun
knowing what's going to happen.

46:21.980 --> 46:24.334
You're still here.

46:25.967 --> 46:28.793
Did I fall asleep?

46:30.411 --> 46:33.824
Sometimes I don't sleep.

46:35.215 --> 46:37.215
So I think...

46:39.252 --> 46:42.195
I think about how it was.

46:44.552 --> 46:47.260
It's all I have left.

46:50.988 --> 46:54.167
What do you see when you look at me?

46:54.383 --> 46:58.716
A grumpy old man
who never answers questions?

46:58.751 --> 47:00.953
Who mixes everything up?

47:01.935 --> 47:06.999
Who is kept busy by getting his meals?

47:08.723 --> 47:11.077
Now that's not me...

47:14.368 --> 47:16.368
Me...

47:18.142 --> 47:20.261
I wear shorts.

47:22.423 --> 47:25.484
I'm nine years old.

47:27.035 --> 47:30.567
I can run faster than the train.

47:33.127 --> 47:37.012
I can't feel my aching back anymore.

47:38.858 --> 47:40.860
I'm 15.

47:43.654 --> 47:45.772
I'm 15.

47:47.561 --> 47:49.680
And I'm in love.

47:52.549 --> 47:54.549
I'm in love.

49:17.319 --> 49:19.319
Nemo?

49:19.876 --> 49:21.876
Nemo?

49:24.224 --> 49:26.224
Nemo?

49:32.012 --> 49:34.277
Isn't he sleeping in the study?

49:34.377 --> 49:37.288
No, I just looked and he isn't there.

49:37.388 --> 49:42.063
Anna, have you seen your brother?
- He's not my brother.

49:51.213 --> 49:53.933
Oh, there you are.
Sleep alright?

50:18.401 --> 50:20.756
Who's that?
- It's me.

50:22.932 --> 50:24.308
It's me, Dad...

50:24.408 --> 50:26.223
Nemo.

50:26.323 --> 50:28.036
Your son.

50:28.136 --> 50:30.136
Of course, son.

50:30.413 --> 50:33.710
Where were you?
- At the shop, Dad.

50:34.506 --> 50:36.242
I always work at the shop after school.

50:36.342 --> 50:40.817
You know, a boy your age
should get out more.

50:40.852 --> 50:44.031
You can leave me alone, you know.
I-I can manage.

50:44.131 --> 50:46.131
It's no problem, Dad.

50:46.588 --> 50:48.588
I like being at home.

51:17.846 --> 51:21.564
There was a card
from your mother in the post.

51:21.664 --> 51:25.685
You have not read it.
- I know. I'll read it later.

51:25.785 --> 51:28.590
Won't you go and see her one day?

51:28.642 --> 51:31.067
I haven't seen her in seven years.

51:31.167 --> 51:36.012
If she ever wanted to see me,
she'd know where to find me.

51:37.691 --> 51:40.180
I've got everything I need, Dad.

51:40.280 --> 51:42.280
Everything's fine.

52:16.381 --> 52:18.500
After three months,

52:18.779 --> 52:21.016
and six days of travel...

52:24.342 --> 52:26.807
...the shuttle was heading...

52:27.947 --> 52:31.715
...directly toward the Cancer nebula...

52:33.295 --> 52:35.767
...in line with Uranus...

52:37.482 --> 52:39.482
...and its five moons.

53:00.405 --> 53:04.400
It was finally aproaching
Mars and the Colonies.

53:08.936 --> 53:10.936
Onboard...

53:11.107 --> 53:16.887
...the computer was monitoring
the passengers' artificial hibernation

53:32.231 --> 53:34.231
Elise.

55:09.974 --> 55:11.974
I'm not crazy.

55:12.170 --> 55:13.868
Come on,
it's not that bad.

55:13.968 --> 55:16.876
I didn't say anything mean.

55:19.190 --> 55:21.190
Shall we go, Nemo?

55:21.426 --> 55:24.996
Excuse me?
- Shall we go? He's such a bore.

55:44.918 --> 55:46.918
You'll drown.

55:51.475 --> 55:55.948
How do you know my name?
- We go to the same school.

55:56.808 --> 56:00.633
You never noticed me.
You never notice anyone.

56:06.379 --> 56:08.419
D'you have a girlfriend?

56:10.566 --> 56:13.965
What? Are you queer?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

56:14.065 --> 56:16.065
I don't know...

56:16.402 --> 56:18.402
I-I don't want one.

56:20.789 --> 56:22.789
Tell me about yourself.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.382
You used to piss your pants,
everyone knows you're weirdo.

56:30.482 --> 56:32.482
You're always alone...

56:35.813 --> 56:37.813
Talk.

56:39.786 --> 56:42.081
Or say something.
Come on...

56:47.565 --> 56:50.861
Gravity on Mars is 0.38.

56:53.808 --> 56:57.038
That's three times less than on Earth.

56:58.251 --> 57:02.255
The ground is covered
with an iron oxide dust.

57:10.302 --> 57:12.302
You're incredible.

57:14.242 --> 57:17.775
Raise your hand and say 'I swear.'
- Why?

57:18.118 --> 57:22.878
Promise me that if I die,
you'll spread my ashes on Mars.

57:23.582 --> 57:27.047
It's estimated that travel to Mars
would take six to eight months.

57:27.147 --> 57:29.147
Say 'I swear.'

57:32.741 --> 57:34.741
I swear.

57:38.814 --> 57:42.044
We were neighbors when we were little.

57:44.129 --> 57:45.996
It's Elise.

57:46.096 --> 57:48.096
Don't you remember?

57:48.172 --> 57:50.172
Elise.

57:50.312 --> 57:52.311
I had a feeling I've seen you or something.

57:52.411 --> 57:54.203
Yeah, that's called deja vu.

57:54.303 --> 57:57.260
And the signal from the eyes
goes from the memory...

57:57.360 --> 57:59.360
No, it's not it.

58:00.185 --> 58:02.185
Another life then?

58:03.238 --> 58:05.238
Anyway...

58:05.785 --> 58:07.785
I remembered you.

58:20.873 --> 58:22.420
We shouldn't.

58:22.520 --> 58:25.821
You don't know me
and I am not a good person.

58:25.921 --> 58:27.921
Why do you say that?

58:50.116 --> 58:52.587
Elise, wait.
- I'll call you.

58:52.643 --> 58:55.278
You don't have my phone number.

58:57.477 --> 59:00.367
What happens when we fall in love?

59:01.290 --> 59:04.470
As a result of certain stimuli,

59:04.471 --> 59:08.632
the hypothalamus releases
a powerful discharges of endorphins...

59:08.732 --> 59:12.980
...but why exactly that woman or that man?

59:13.015 --> 59:15.719
Is there a release of
odourless pheromones...

59:15.819 --> 59:18.922
...that correspond to
our complimentary genetic signal?

59:19.022 --> 59:22.477
Or is it physical feutures
that we recognize?

59:22.577 --> 59:24.662
A mother's eyes...

59:25.310 --> 59:28.625
A smell that stimulates a happy memory.

59:29.532 --> 59:33.298
Is love...
part of a plan?

59:33.383 --> 59:37.622
A vast war plan
between two modes of reproduction

59:37.682 --> 59:41.820
Bacteria and viruses
are asexual organisms.

59:41.855 --> 59:44.559
With each cell division,
each multiplication,

59:44.659 --> 59:47.571
they mutate and perfect themselves
much more quickly than we do.

59:47.671 --> 59:52.313
Against this, we respond
with the most fiercing weapon:

59:52.348 --> 59:54.089
Sex.

59:54.189 --> 59:57.291
Two individuals,
by mixing their genes,

59:57.391 --> 1:00:02.874
shuffle the cards and create an individual
who resists viruses better.

1:00:02.974 --> 1:00:05.561
The more disimilar he or she is.

1:00:05.661 --> 1:00:12.206
Now, are we unknowing participants in
a war between two modes of reproduction?

1:00:15.400 --> 1:00:18.290
Okay everyone,
that's it for today.

1:00:20.288 --> 1:00:22.031
How was it?

1:00:22.131 --> 1:00:24.104
You want to know the truth?

1:00:24.204 --> 1:00:27.519
O'key. It was good. It was really good.

1:00:29.822 --> 1:00:32.038
Hey, honey.
- I'm gonna be a little late.

1:00:32.138 --> 1:00:34.263
That's okay. Don't worry.

1:00:34.380 --> 1:00:37.088
I love you.
- I love you more.

1:00:37.089 --> 1:00:39.089
Me more.
- Me more.

1:00:39.096 --> 1:00:41.215
Okay
- Cheater.

1:00:41.979 --> 1:00:44.274
Alright, I'll see ya later.

1:01:44.530 --> 1:01:47.003
I always liked fish.

1:01:47.101 --> 1:01:51.436
I never thought that one day
they would like me too.

1:01:53.453 --> 1:01:55.453
You're very relaxed.

1:01:56.822 --> 1:02:00.000
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

1:02:01.177 --> 1:02:03.178
Remember.

1:02:04.619 --> 1:02:06.619
Remember...

1:02:11.830 --> 1:02:14.066
Remember...

1:03:18.381 --> 1:03:19.282
Nemo...

1:03:19.382 --> 1:03:19.828
Shit.

1:03:19.928 --> 1:03:21.928
Anna...

1:03:23.727 --> 1:03:27.722
We've got errands to run.
We'll back in an hour.

1:03:29.883 --> 1:03:34.005
Anna, cover up.
You're gonna get a sunburn.

1:04:52.248 --> 1:04:54.248
I want you.

1:04:55.115 --> 1:04:57.115
I want you too.

1:04:58.951 --> 1:05:00.951
Forever.

1:05:03.217 --> 1:05:05.217
Forever.

1:05:05.387 --> 1:05:07.387
Whatever happens.

1:05:07.782 --> 1:05:10.247
There is no life without you.

1:05:10.733 --> 1:05:12.733
No life without you.

1:05:36.510 --> 1:05:38.510
You look like my son.

1:05:39.569 --> 1:05:41.569
I am your son, Dad.

1:05:41.888 --> 1:05:44.013
My son's taller than you.

1:05:59.733 --> 1:06:01.733
Elise

1:07:05.843 --> 1:07:07.843
Someone just came in.

1:07:09.118 --> 1:07:12.415
If I could at least move my fingers.

1:07:13.633 --> 1:07:15.633
Or my eyes.

1:07:16.728 --> 1:07:19.108
Do you think he can hear us?

1:07:19.350 --> 1:07:21.135
Have you seen any reaction?

1:07:21.235 --> 1:07:22.776
I don't know, but...

1:07:22.876 --> 1:07:24.543
I've got a feeling that he can.

1:07:24.643 --> 1:07:25.941
Who's there?

1:07:26.041 --> 1:07:27.761
What am I doing here?

1:07:27.861 --> 1:07:30.405
If you can hear me,
move your fingers.

1:07:30.505 --> 1:07:31.817
I've got to get out of here.

1:07:31.917 --> 1:07:34.390
Go back,
before the accident.

1:08:05.160 --> 1:08:07.160
I believe one thing.

1:08:09.196 --> 1:08:15.146
I believe that we should always say
'I love you' to the people we love.

1:08:21.887 --> 1:08:23.887
I love you.

1:08:31.026 --> 1:08:34.557
Nemo... we shouldn't.

1:08:36.189 --> 1:08:38.189
I love Stefano.

1:08:39.121 --> 1:08:40.729
What?

1:08:40.829 --> 1:08:43.634
You saw him at the party with me.

1:08:45.384 --> 1:08:47.384
He doesn't love me.

1:08:48.714 --> 1:08:49.299
And so...

1:08:49.399 --> 1:08:51.399
I love him anyways.

1:08:51.458 --> 1:08:53.458
I can't help myself.

1:08:54.163 --> 1:08:56.163
I'm in love with him.

1:08:58.374 --> 1:09:00.374
I'm sorry.

1:09:12.065 --> 1:09:13.745
Dad, I'm getting married.

1:09:13.845 --> 1:09:15.132
Oh.

1:09:15.232 --> 1:09:17.242
And who is the lucky lady?

1:09:17.342 --> 1:09:19.342
No, it's not that.

1:09:19.977 --> 1:09:24.822
I'm gonna marry the first girl
who dances with me tonight.

1:10:01.092 --> 1:10:03.092
Thanks, Nemo.

1:10:39.735 --> 1:10:41.735
Nemo.

1:10:46.864 --> 1:10:51.284
On that day, I would make
a lot of foolish decisions.

1:10:52.275 --> 1:10:55.590
One, I will never
leave anything to chance again.

1:10:55.690 --> 1:10:58.914
Two, I will marry the girl on my motorcycle.

1:10:59.014 --> 1:11:01.014
Three, I'll be rich.

1:11:01.102 --> 1:11:03.227
Four, we'll have a house.

1:11:03.262 --> 1:11:04.429
A big house.

1:11:04.529 --> 1:11:06.671
Painted yellow,
with a garden,

1:11:06.771 --> 1:11:09.108
and two children,
Paul and Michael.

1:11:09.208 --> 1:11:12.716
Five, I'll have a convertible--
A red convertible.

1:11:12.816 --> 1:11:15.297
And a swimming pool.
I'll learn to swim.

1:11:15.397 --> 1:11:19.399
Six, I will not stop until I've succeeded.

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:42.560
Daddy?

1:11:44.089 --> 1:11:46.089
Daddy?

1:11:49.498 --> 1:11:51.963
Paul, don't wake your father.

1:11:52.398 --> 1:11:53.926
Elise?

1:11:54.026 --> 1:11:56.026
It's me, Jean.

1:11:58.308 --> 1:12:00.308
Who is Elise?

1:12:03.495 --> 1:12:05.982
I don't know anyone called Elise.

1:12:06.082 --> 1:12:08.082
Go back and play Paul.

1:12:10.731 --> 1:12:13.439
Nemo, do I matter to you?

1:12:17.214 --> 1:12:18.290
I just...

1:12:18.390 --> 1:12:21.450
I just like to ask you one question.

1:12:22.335 --> 1:12:24.460
Did you do it on purpose?

1:12:27.322 --> 1:12:30.212
I found this on the bedside table.

1:12:31.065 --> 1:12:35.347
There comes a time in life
when everything seems narrow.

1:12:35.447 --> 1:12:40.121
Choices have been made
I can only continue on.

1:12:40.430 --> 1:12:43.745
I know myself like the back of my hand.

1:12:44.537 --> 1:12:47.145
I can predict my every reaction.

1:12:47.245 --> 1:12:49.455
Everything is predictable.

1:12:49.550 --> 1:12:54.278
My life has been cast in cement
with airbags and seatbelts.

1:12:54.378 --> 1:12:56.217
I've controlled everything.

1:12:56.317 --> 1:13:01.061
I've done everything to reach
this point and now that I'm here,

1:13:01.161 --> 1:13:03.280
I'm fucking bored.

1:13:05.428 --> 1:13:09.848
The hardest thing is knowing
whether I'm still alive.

1:13:16.517 --> 1:13:18.753
It is my handwriting.

1:13:19.968 --> 1:13:21.969
I don't remember.

1:13:39.547 --> 1:13:41.547
Jean?

1:13:44.319 --> 1:13:46.319
What did you say?

1:13:49.436 --> 1:13:51.436
I had a weird dream.

1:14:11.134 --> 1:14:14.242
Well, it's important for you to understand.

1:14:14.342 --> 1:14:17.958
In life things don't always turn out...

1:14:18.532 --> 1:14:20.532
...as we plan them.

1:14:21.097 --> 1:14:23.097
Harry and I thought...

1:14:25.397 --> 1:14:28.141
Life isn't what we all think it will be.

1:14:28.241 --> 1:14:30.536
What are you talking about?

1:14:31.496 --> 1:14:33.496
I don't understand.

1:14:33.903 --> 1:14:35.903
Anna knows already.

1:14:38.615 --> 1:14:41.505
Harry and I are going to separate.

1:14:42.681 --> 1:14:44.681
What?

1:14:45.311 --> 1:14:47.311
Why?

1:14:48.266 --> 1:14:51.945
You have no right.
- Please, you played your part.

1:14:52.045 --> 1:14:54.076
I don't know what is going on
between you two...

1:14:54.176 --> 1:14:56.678
...and I don't wanna know.
It's sick.

1:14:56.778 --> 1:15:03.068
You're brother and sister, for God's sake.
- We are not brother and sister.

1:15:08.804 --> 1:15:10.804
You knew.

1:15:11.564 --> 1:15:13.564
And you didn't tell me.

1:15:21.010 --> 1:15:23.010
Where are you going?

1:15:25.145 --> 1:15:27.145
To New York.

1:15:28.804 --> 1:15:31.040
In ten days.

1:15:32.578 --> 1:15:34.958
My father found a job there.

1:15:45.052 --> 1:15:47.942
Wait for me near the lighthouse...

1:15:48.015 --> 1:15:50.135
...every Sunday, okay?

1:15:51.886 --> 1:15:54.246
Until we see each other again.

1:15:54.346 --> 1:15:56.582
For life, okay?

1:16:00.226 --> 1:16:02.226
It's not over.

1:16:09.584 --> 1:16:13.664
You're the first and last person I'll ever love.

1:16:14.876 --> 1:16:16.876
Ten days.

1:16:18.487 --> 1:16:20.487
That makes...

1:16:21.136 --> 1:16:23.136
...14 thousand...

1:16:23.692 --> 1:16:25.692
...400 minutes.

1:16:29.629 --> 1:16:32.944
I wish everything would stop right now.

1:16:34.636 --> 1:16:37.611
Things would stay this way forever.

1:16:39.877 --> 1:16:43.532
They say that if you slow your breathing...

1:16:43.872 --> 1:16:45.872
...time slows down.

1:16:47.699 --> 1:16:49.699
The Hindu say so.

1:17:30.279 --> 1:17:34.954
I have to remember the smell
of every part of your body.

1:17:44.481 --> 1:17:47.116
We'll meet near the lighthouse.

1:18:10.301 --> 1:18:12.303
Anna, it's time to go.

1:18:22.686 --> 1:18:24.686
I love you.

1:19:07.983 --> 1:19:10.926
Anna.

1:19:46.536 --> 1:19:48.536
Anna...

1:19:48.539 --> 1:19:50.539
Can you hear me?

1:20:12.406 --> 1:20:14.701
We must look to the future.

1:20:14.976 --> 1:20:17.147
It will be good to move house.

1:20:17.247 --> 1:20:19.247
Have a new life.

1:20:19.474 --> 1:20:21.474
Will we have a pool?

1:20:21.695 --> 1:20:24.670
You hate water.
You don't even swim.

1:20:24.843 --> 1:20:27.719
You never know what you want.
- You know what I don't want?

1:20:27.819 --> 1:20:31.049
So tell me, what is it you don't want?

1:20:32.876 --> 1:20:35.256
I don't want to be like you.

1:20:37.344 --> 1:20:39.554
You know nothing about me.

1:20:40.227 --> 1:20:42.267
I've always loved pools.

1:20:44.387 --> 1:20:47.107
When I'm older,
I'll have a pool.

1:21:42.055 --> 1:21:44.055
Anna.

1:21:44.756 --> 1:21:46.756
Anna.

1:21:47.642 --> 1:21:52.147
I feel like I'll be seeing you
at every street corner.

1:22:13.214 --> 1:22:15.687
Sometimes I tell myself...

1:22:16.376 --> 1:22:19.180
...maybe you live in the same town I do...

1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:21.279
...and I don't know where.

1:22:21.379 --> 1:22:24.558
Maybe you're here,
very close.

1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:28.654
Nemo, do you hear my voice?

1:22:30.730 --> 1:22:32.730
Anna.

1:22:33.359 --> 1:22:36.363
After 90 days,
the onboard computer...

1:22:36.463 --> 1:22:39.072
...is still maintaining
the passengers' metabolism...

1:22:39.172 --> 1:22:42.402
...at the level of a hibernating frog.

1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:09.948
He'd always been fascinated by the fact...

1:23:10.048 --> 1:23:13.412
...that certain frogs can spend
the winter completely frozen.

1:23:13.512 --> 1:23:15.733
and that when spring comes comma,

1:23:15.833 --> 1:23:20.024
they defrost and begin living again period.

1:23:21.575 --> 1:23:23.904
The onboard computer displayed...

1:23:24.004 --> 1:23:26.359
'End of hibernation'.

1:23:40.529 --> 1:23:42.529
Welcome to Mars.

1:23:42.799 --> 1:23:47.489
We hope you had a pleasant dream
and a refreshing re-awakening.

1:23:47.589 --> 1:23:52.138
Please leave your sleep suits in
your suspended animation cubicles...

1:23:52.238 --> 1:23:56.573
...and make your way
through to the Arrivals lounge.

1:23:57.264 --> 1:24:00.437
You will be directed to
the rest and recoveration rooms...

1:24:00.537 --> 1:24:05.892
...to prepare for your first excursion
to the red planet itself.

1:24:08.466 --> 1:24:11.093
Probably the worst thing
about being on Mars...

1:24:11.193 --> 1:24:13.678
...is that nothing will happen there.

1:24:13.778 --> 1:24:16.413
Time will seem stole and empty.

1:24:17.679 --> 1:24:20.192
That doesn't look like there's much to do.

1:24:20.292 --> 1:24:23.012
I hope I brought enough we took.

1:24:50.314 --> 1:24:52.314
Day time.

1:24:52.854 --> 1:24:54.854
It's day time.

1:24:55.989 --> 1:24:57.989
The sun is out.

1:24:58.561 --> 1:25:02.046
It's warmer on the right than on the left

1:25:05.026 --> 1:25:09.617
She's different from the one this morning.

1:25:11.630 --> 1:25:13.630
Not the same perfume.

1:25:15.848 --> 1:25:17.849
Her hands are soft.

1:25:20.127 --> 1:25:22.127
Elise.

1:25:23.956 --> 1:25:25.956
Is that Elise?

1:25:29.761 --> 1:25:31.999
We sh... We shoudn't.

1:25:34.254 --> 1:25:36.373
I love Stefano.
- Shh.

1:25:38.610 --> 1:25:40.610
Don't say anything.

1:25:41.007 --> 1:25:43.007
You're the one I love.

1:25:44.299 --> 1:25:46.764
You can count on me for Mars.

1:25:47.512 --> 1:25:49.512
I promise.

1:26:26.608 --> 1:26:30.008
Do you wanna go for a walk or something?

1:26:30.414 --> 1:26:32.533
I don't want anything.

1:26:33.499 --> 1:26:35.499
Nothing.

1:26:39.425 --> 1:26:42.487
I'm so horrible.
- No, you're not.

1:26:42.695 --> 1:26:46.102
You're not horrible.
- I can't stand this life anymore.

1:26:46.202 --> 1:26:48.715
Think about it, you've got
the most incredible kids.

1:26:48.815 --> 1:26:54.340
Stop trying to make me feel better.
I'm actually feeling guiltier.

1:26:56.234 --> 1:26:58.589
What's wrong with me?

1:27:01.162 --> 1:27:03.282
What is wrong with me?

1:27:12.454 --> 1:27:14.454
How's Mom?

1:27:14.484 --> 1:27:17.134
She's just a little tired.
She's sleeping.

1:27:17.234 --> 1:27:21.709
She's always tired.
- Yeah, she's always tired.

1:27:23.070 --> 1:27:24.958
Is she depressed?

1:27:25.058 --> 1:27:27.331
Well, she has ups and downs.

1:27:27.431 --> 1:27:28.536
I don't know about you,

1:27:28.636 --> 1:27:30.578
but next time Mom
has one of her meltdowns,

1:27:30.678 --> 1:27:33.483
I'm gonna go live somewhere else.

1:27:37.646 --> 1:27:41.649
So... who has a joke?

1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:45.080
Anybody?

1:27:45.782 --> 1:27:47.392
I do.

1:27:47.492 --> 1:27:52.319
What's green, small
and goes up and down?

1:27:52.970 --> 1:27:54.630
A pea in an elevator.

1:27:54.730 --> 1:27:58.345
It's not funny.
Old people humor.

1:28:00.276 --> 1:28:01.717
Are you gonna be okay?

1:28:01.817 --> 1:28:06.407
Of course. Not 'cause Mom's
not okay that I'm not okay.

1:28:25.217 --> 1:28:27.342
I can't stand it anymore.

1:28:27.622 --> 1:28:31.447
That noise...
- I'll ask them to keep it down.

1:28:32.350 --> 1:28:34.645
But it is Joyce's birthday.

1:28:37.859 --> 1:28:39.984
What kind of mother am I?

1:28:42.976 --> 1:28:44.976
I gotta get up.

1:29:07.688 --> 1:29:09.145
Are you having a good time?
- Yeah.

1:29:09.245 --> 1:29:10.569
Can I tell you one thing?

1:29:10.669 --> 1:29:12.772
You're not allowed to be partying
and not have a good time.

1:29:12.872 --> 1:29:13.340
It doesn't work that way.

1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:14.861
I know...
- And you know what, Tess?

1:29:14.961 --> 1:29:16.391
You look beautiful.

1:29:16.491 --> 1:29:18.295
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful...

1:29:18.395 --> 1:29:20.062
But your friends aren't dancing enough...

1:29:20.162 --> 1:29:23.875
And your mother has to
take care of the situation.

1:29:23.975 --> 1:29:25.975
Dancing.

1:29:27.517 --> 1:29:29.517
You, over there.

1:29:43.107 --> 1:29:45.487
Oh, oh.
This makes me like...

1:29:46.375 --> 1:29:48.375
Like a dog.

1:29:57.851 --> 1:30:01.676
Now let's get ready.
Take one... two... three.

1:30:22.928 --> 1:30:25.046
It was a nice day.

1:30:27.577 --> 1:30:29.814
Nicest in a long time.

1:30:35.258 --> 1:30:37.043
Okey-dokey.

1:30:37.143 --> 1:30:39.143
Ready?
- Bye, Dad.

1:30:39.628 --> 1:30:41.747
Bye. Bye.

1:30:41.748 --> 1:30:43.748
Have fun.
- Bye, Dad.

1:30:44.270 --> 1:30:46.270
Bye-bye.

1:32:05.792 --> 1:32:07.069
I'm leaving.

1:32:07.169 --> 1:32:09.311
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

1:32:36.927 --> 1:32:38.927
Everything will be OK.

1:32:39.432 --> 1:32:41.982
That will be all right. Comon.

1:32:52.289 --> 1:32:54.289
Do you love me?

1:32:55.790 --> 1:32:58.255
I could not live without you.

1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:10.685
There is no life without you.

1:36:16.107 --> 1:36:18.107
Go slowly.

1:36:20.813 --> 1:36:22.938
I have to get used to it.

1:36:26.809 --> 1:36:32.543
I talked to you so much when you
weren't there. It's so strange for me...

1:36:32.643 --> 1:36:34.938
...to talk to you for real.

1:36:52.074 --> 1:36:54.075
I need some time, Nemo.

1:36:56.765 --> 1:36:58.956
When we were separated at 15,

1:36:59.056 --> 1:37:02.046
I said I would never love anyone else.

1:37:02.146 --> 1:37:04.146
Ever.

1:37:04.366 --> 1:37:06.731
I would never become attached.

1:37:06.831 --> 1:37:09.174
I'd never see you put anywhere.

1:37:09.274 --> 1:37:11.654
I'd have nothing for myself.

1:37:14.564 --> 1:37:18.332
I decided I would pretend to be alive.

1:37:23.332 --> 1:37:26.148
And this is what I've been waiting for.

1:37:26.248 --> 1:37:28.249
All this time...

1:37:30.266 --> 1:37:35.329
Renouncing all possible lives,
for one only...

1:37:36.430 --> 1:37:38.430
With you.

1:37:47.516 --> 1:37:50.151
But I'm not used to it anymore.

1:37:51.024 --> 1:37:54.847
you know... love... I mean.

1:37:58.719 --> 1:38:01.354
I'm afraid of losing you again,

1:38:01.443 --> 1:38:04.402
I'm afraid of having to do without you again

1:38:04.502 --> 1:38:05.956
I...

1:38:06.056 --> 1:38:08.056
I'm terrified of that.

1:38:13.060 --> 1:38:15.185
We need to take some time

1:38:16.250 --> 1:38:18.885
And, when will I see you again?

1:38:26.062 --> 1:38:28.187
Call me at this number...

1:38:31.362 --> 1:38:33.362
...in two days

1:38:36.845 --> 1:38:39.565
I'll meet you at the lighthouse.

1:39:21.846 --> 1:39:24.788
You know why I lost Anna?

1:39:26.418 --> 1:39:28.889
because two months earlier

1:39:29.186 --> 1:39:32.571
An unployed Brazilian boiled an egg

1:39:38.336 --> 1:39:42.380
The heat created a
micro-climate in the room...

1:39:43.128 --> 1:39:46.103
...slight differece of temperature.

1:39:48.570 --> 1:39:54.095
and heavy rain, two months later
on the other side of the world...

1:39:54.477 --> 1:39:59.704
...that Brazilian boiled an egg
instead of being at work

1:40:00.112 --> 1:40:03.013
He would have lost his job
in a clothing factory...

1:40:03.113 --> 1:40:05.095
...because six months earlier

1:40:05.195 --> 1:40:07.225
I would have compared
the prices of jeans...

1:40:07.325 --> 1:40:09.900
...and I will have bought the cheaper pair.

1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.247
As the Chinese proverb says...

1:40:12.347 --> 1:40:16.459
'A single snowflake
can bend the leaf of the bamboo.'

1:40:16.559 --> 1:40:20.894
Jeans production will have
moved to other countries.

1:40:28.439 --> 1:40:31.055
I lost every trace of Anna.

1:40:34.899 --> 1:40:36.899
I waited for her...

1:40:37.894 --> 1:40:39.894
...every day.

1:42:09.963 --> 1:42:11.963
Anna.

1:42:15.391 --> 1:42:17.391
Nemo.

1:42:26.715 --> 1:42:27.616
It's back.

1:42:27.716 --> 1:42:29.101
The fear is back.

1:42:29.201 --> 1:42:31.693
I'm sick of pills.

1:42:31.741 --> 1:42:34.925
I'm sick of doctors. It's pointless.

1:42:35.611 --> 1:42:38.207
I'll do something. I can't stand it any more.

1:42:38.307 --> 1:42:40.307
I'm afraid.

1:42:40.419 --> 1:42:42.629
I don't know what to do...

1:42:46.656 --> 1:42:48.696
I often have this dream.

1:42:49.330 --> 1:42:51.370
It's a prehistoric time.

1:42:52.818 --> 1:42:55.113
I can hear you screaming...

1:43:06.429 --> 1:43:08.429
I chased the bear.

1:43:08.879 --> 1:43:11.429
And you're not afraid anymore.

1:43:11.583 --> 1:43:13.583
But when I wake up...

1:43:15.325 --> 1:43:17.325
When I wake up...

1:43:17.487 --> 1:43:19.487
...there's no bear...

1:43:20.370 --> 1:43:22.665
...but you're still afraid.

1:43:22.874 --> 1:43:24.874
I'm not a bear hunter

1:43:25.796 --> 1:43:29.470
I'm an executive of a plant that
manufactures photocopy machines...

1:43:29.570 --> 1:43:31.695
...who just quit his job.

1:43:32.764 --> 1:43:34.764
I don't dare to move.

1:43:35.774 --> 1:43:37.774
I don't live

1:43:38.449 --> 1:43:40.574
All of I do is a disaster

1:43:43.206 --> 1:43:46.812
I would so love to be able
to chase the bear away...

1:43:46.912 --> 1:43:50.312
...and for you not to be afraid anymore.

1:43:53.008 --> 1:43:56.068
To what extent are our fears innate?

1:43:57.423 --> 1:43:59.992
When we hatch goose eggs
in an incubator,

1:44:00.092 --> 1:44:05.786
and then, above the baby birds
pass a form simulating a goose in flight...

1:44:05.886 --> 1:44:08.651
...the birds strech their necks and call out

1:44:08.751 --> 1:44:12.249
But if we invert the direction
of the silhouette,

1:44:12.349 --> 1:44:14.460
it conjures the shape of a falcon.

1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:17.432
The response of the baby birds
is immediate.

1:44:17.532 --> 1:44:21.485
They will crouch and fear, though
they've never before seen a falcon.

1:44:21.585 --> 1:44:23.709
Without any instruction,

1:44:24.532 --> 1:44:27.677
an innate fear helps them to survive.

1:44:29.127 --> 1:44:31.127
But in humans...

1:44:31.346 --> 1:44:33.811
...to what ancient dangers...

1:44:34.024 --> 1:44:37.169
...might our innate fears correspond?

1:45:15.026 --> 1:45:18.507
NEMO... TURN AROUND...

1:45:30.408 --> 1:45:31.891
Hey.

1:45:31.991 --> 1:45:33.643
Hey.

1:45:33.743 --> 1:45:35.743
Excuse me.

1:46:19.878 --> 1:46:21.878
Remember...

1:46:22.985 --> 1:46:24.985
Remember.

1:47:38.910 --> 1:47:40.910
Honey, it's me.

1:48:57.398 --> 1:48:59.778
Did Elise die or didn't she?

1:49:00.729 --> 1:49:02.729
I don't get it.

1:49:02.828 --> 1:49:06.993
You can't have had children
and not have had them.

1:49:14.944 --> 1:49:16.944
Hi, Dad.

1:49:18.223 --> 1:49:19.983
Hi.

1:49:20.083 --> 1:49:22.083
Hey.

1:49:22.837 --> 1:49:25.047
I'll be in a minute, guys.

1:49:47.970 --> 1:49:51.540
You're not hungry?
- I don't want anything.

1:49:51.555 --> 1:49:53.555
Nothing.

1:49:56.737 --> 1:49:58.862
What are you doing today?

1:49:58.940 --> 1:50:03.955
I was thinking about taking
the opportunity to wash the car.

1:50:08.693 --> 1:50:11.243
What's the deal with that car?

1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:14.600
What do you mean?

1:50:14.899 --> 1:50:20.802
Why do you such good care of that car
while you leave me here all alone?

1:50:20.902 --> 1:50:23.452
What's the problem of the car?

1:51:11.504 --> 1:51:14.649
There's no more problem with the car.

1:51:28.337 --> 1:51:30.000
What's wrong?

1:51:30.100 --> 1:51:32.886
Why are you looking at me like that?

1:51:32.986 --> 1:51:36.046
Why are you looking at me like that?

1:51:37.258 --> 1:51:39.258
Nemo.

1:51:40.015 --> 1:51:42.395
Do I take sugar in my cofee?

1:51:44.820 --> 1:51:47.245
Can you please answer me?

1:51:47.673 --> 1:51:49.673
Nemo.

1:51:52.857 --> 1:51:57.702
You don't know me, Nemo.
You've never really looked at me.

1:52:03.535 --> 1:52:06.246
You've always been elsewhere.

1:52:07.843 --> 1:52:11.158
Do you realize how much you've hurt me?

1:52:19.598 --> 1:52:24.489
I got a call from the lawer. He
just says you just put everything...

1:52:24.589 --> 1:52:26.598
...you own on my name.

1:52:27.761 --> 1:52:29.761
Why, Nemo?

1:52:30.848 --> 1:52:32.848
What you're up to?

1:52:50.937 --> 1:52:52.966
Are you angling for success?

1:52:53.066 --> 1:52:54.868
Then you need a butterfly fishing rod.

1:52:54.968 --> 1:52:57.951
For tension and strength is....

1:52:57.952 --> 1:53:01.063
Buy one today, available now.

1:53:08.162 --> 1:53:10.162
Jean.

1:53:10.166 --> 1:53:12.546
A'm after buy a fishing rod.

1:54:00.111 --> 1:54:02.111
Mr. Jones.

1:54:03.373 --> 1:54:05.701
Yes.
- We already have your luggage.

1:54:05.801 --> 1:54:07.630
Please, follow me.

1:54:07.730 --> 1:54:10.262
I'll take you to the hotel
where you can rest for a while.

1:54:10.362 --> 1:54:12.657
The appointment is at 3 PM.

1:54:38.997 --> 1:54:40.997
Daniel.

1:54:41.177 --> 1:54:42.959
Daniel Jones.

1:54:43.059 --> 1:54:45.445
Daniel Jones.

1:54:46.850 --> 1:54:50.266
Is your name Daniel Jones?

1:54:52.110 --> 1:54:54.660
Of course not.

1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:01.977
Daniel Jones...

1:55:05.318 --> 1:55:07.063
Hallo?

1:55:07.163 --> 1:55:08.999
Daniel?

1:55:09.099 --> 1:55:10.337
Yes.

1:55:10.437 --> 1:55:12.468
Are you insane?

1:55:12.469 --> 1:55:15.026
I told you not to go. They are furious.

1:55:15.126 --> 1:55:18.271
They know it's you. Don't stay there.

1:55:51.037 --> 1:55:53.037
This is weird.

1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:55.910
His shoes are different sizes.

1:56:06.953 --> 1:56:08.239
Maybe he shrunk.

1:56:08.339 --> 1:56:10.736
Times when you get older,
you shrink.

1:56:10.836 --> 1:56:12.801
No one shrinks,
that's rubbish.

1:56:12.901 --> 1:56:15.373
You got the wrong plug, that's all.

1:56:15.473 --> 1:56:18.633
Astronauts shrink two inches
when they come back to Earth.

1:56:18.733 --> 1:56:24.853
Because of gravity or something.
- You think this fellow is an astronaut?

1:56:52.541 --> 1:56:56.111
The ground doesn't vibrate
in the same way.

1:56:57.849 --> 1:56:59.974
It's a different perfume.

1:57:01.343 --> 1:57:03.399
How old might she be?

1:57:03.891 --> 1:57:05.891
Twenty five?

1:57:07.727 --> 1:57:10.600
There are other people too.

1:57:19.527 --> 1:57:22.007
Let's begin again.

1:57:22.533 --> 1:57:24.573
Fingers on the keyboard.

1:57:26.194 --> 1:57:29.379
Left hand: A, S, D, F.

1:57:31.047 --> 1:57:34.124
Right hand: H, J, K, L.

1:58:51.223 --> 1:58:54.963
What's wrong?
- I was dreaming about Stefano.

1:58:58.042 --> 1:59:00.762
He doesn't give a damn about me.

1:59:01.611 --> 1:59:03.611
Stefano?

1:59:09.359 --> 1:59:11.359
I love him.

1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:17.645
I can't see any other explanation
for being in this state.

1:59:18.116 --> 1:59:20.836
That's the only thing it can be.

1:59:21.650 --> 1:59:23.650
I love him.

1:59:25.496 --> 1:59:27.496
I know I'm crazy.

1:59:29.444 --> 1:59:32.684
Every morning when I wake up,
I open my eyes and I see your face...

1:59:32.784 --> 1:59:34.784
...and I start crying.

1:59:37.612 --> 1:59:41.777
I realize that with you,
my life is passing me by.

1:59:45.449 --> 1:59:48.498
How can you stay so calm?

1:59:48.498 --> 1:59:51.210
How can you bear that?

1:59:51.211 --> 1:59:52.992
You're not human.

1:59:53.092 --> 1:59:55.132
I don't know what to do.

1:59:56.444 --> 1:59:58.569
It's not my fault, right?

1:59:58.665 --> 2:00:01.130
You're not gonna leave me,
are you?

2:00:01.230 --> 2:00:03.950
No, I couldn't live without you.

2:00:06.074 --> 2:00:08.074
I've hurt everybody.

2:00:08.782 --> 2:00:10.782
I've hurt you.

2:00:11.610 --> 2:00:13.610
The children...

2:00:14.607 --> 2:00:17.891
I just can't go on.
- Together we can do it.

2:00:17.991 --> 2:00:22.000
If I stay here, you're all gonna
end up drowning with me.

2:00:22.100 --> 2:00:24.100
We'll learn to swim.

2:00:24.689 --> 2:00:26.689
I love you.

2:00:27.772 --> 2:00:29.772
I love you.

2:00:31.752 --> 2:00:33.752
I love you.

2:00:53.582 --> 2:00:55.582
She left me.

2:00:59.853 --> 2:01:02.280
You know what they say...

2:01:03.489 --> 2:01:06.209
Everything works out in the end,

2:01:08.132 --> 2:01:10.132
even badly.

2:01:38.709 --> 2:01:40.709
Hello?

2:01:50.490 --> 2:01:53.210
Not too much at the top, thanks.

2:02:06.149 --> 2:02:09.379
How much should that be?
- $20, please.

2:02:09.663 --> 2:02:11.703
Here you go.
- Thank you.

2:02:24.187 --> 2:02:26.998
$20 please, sir.
- Here you are.

2:02:27.255 --> 2:02:28.719
Thank you. Bye, sir.

2:02:28.819 --> 2:02:31.554
Bye, and have a nice afternoon.

2:02:55.983 --> 2:02:59.918
Why does cigarette smoke
never go back into the cigarette?

2:03:00.018 --> 2:03:02.778
Why do molecules spread
away from each other?

2:03:02.878 --> 2:03:05.892
Why does a spilled drop
of ink never reform?

2:03:05.992 --> 2:03:10.536
Because the Universe
moves towards a state of dissipation.

2:03:10.636 --> 2:03:12.526
That is the principle of entropy...

2:03:12.626 --> 2:03:14.603
The tendency of the Universe...

2:03:14.703 --> 2:03:18.298
...to evolve toward a state
of increasing disorder.

2:03:18.398 --> 2:03:19.785
The principle of entropy...

2:03:19.885 --> 2:03:23.030
...is related to the arrow of time...

2:03:23.110 --> 2:03:25.649
A result of the expansion of the Universe.

2:03:25.749 --> 2:03:27.830
But what will happen
when gravitational forces...

2:03:27.930 --> 2:03:31.068
...counter-balance the forces of expansion?

2:03:31.168 --> 2:03:34.425
Or if the energy of the quantum void
proves too weak?

2:03:34.525 --> 2:03:38.698
At that moment, the universe
might enter its phase of contraction.

2:03:38.798 --> 2:03:40.798
The Big Crunch.

2:03:44.295 --> 2:03:46.675
So what will become of time?

2:03:49.750 --> 2:03:51.750
Will it reverse?

2:03:58.049 --> 2:04:00.089
No one knows the answer.

2:04:05.080 --> 2:04:05.981
Where is Peter?

2:04:06.081 --> 2:04:10.772
He left an hour ago. I'm replacing
him. I've selected take 3 and take 4.

2:04:10.872 --> 2:04:13.973
I prefer that Peter does it. I don't mean
to say you're not good enough.

2:04:14.073 --> 2:04:15.599
But...

2:04:15.699 --> 2:04:18.023
Drop it. In live you get one take.

2:04:18.123 --> 2:04:21.098
If it's bad, you just deal with it.

2:04:49.610 --> 2:04:51.610
You know him?

2:04:52.110 --> 2:04:54.148
We work together.

2:04:55.656 --> 2:04:59.131
If I should die, and you shoul live,

2:05:32.026 --> 2:05:33.458
I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

2:05:33.558 --> 2:05:35.830
My sincerest condolences.

2:05:35.986 --> 2:05:37.986
Peter was a colleague.

2:05:38.338 --> 2:05:39.322
Of course.

2:05:39.422 --> 2:05:42.907
I've seen your show.
Thank you for coming.

2:06:15.596 --> 2:06:17.595
Please take this oportunity to take...

2:06:17.695 --> 2:06:20.718
...one last close look at the planet's surface.

2:06:20.818 --> 2:06:23.028
from our observation dome.

2:06:23.237 --> 2:06:28.422
Your elevator will arrive shortly
in the Mars transit station.

2:06:33.977 --> 2:06:37.292
What are we doing with all those bikes?

2:06:37.354 --> 2:06:40.504
They're for export.
Labor is much cheaper here.

2:06:40.604 --> 2:06:43.579
China has become way too expensive.

2:06:45.087 --> 2:06:48.103
Please proceed to the preparation area...

2:06:48.203 --> 2:06:51.866
...where you will be reissued
to your sleep suits.

2:06:51.966 --> 2:06:55.269
You will also receive your...

2:06:55.747 --> 2:06:57.539
Hi.

2:06:57.639 --> 2:06:59.639
I'm Nemo.

2:06:59.754 --> 2:07:01.448
Anna...

2:07:01.548 --> 2:07:03.548
Nice to meet you.

2:07:07.551 --> 2:07:09.591
What brings you to Mars?

2:07:09.828 --> 2:07:14.801
I'm measuring the distance between
Mars and Earth at it's greatest.

2:07:14.901 --> 2:07:17.121
I study time. You know...

2:07:17.675 --> 2:07:22.860
Thing that makes it so that
everything doesn't happen at once.

2:07:24.734 --> 2:07:25.559
And?

2:07:25.659 --> 2:07:28.130
The Big Crunch will happen in 2092...

2:07:28.230 --> 2:07:33.415
...and people who can't hang
on that long will get a free run.

2:07:34.240 --> 2:07:35.647
And you?

2:07:35.747 --> 2:07:38.467
I'm just keeping an old promise.

2:07:43.626 --> 2:07:45.295
Hi.

2:07:45.395 --> 2:07:47.395
Hi.

2:07:47.889 --> 2:07:51.204
We ah... met at your husband's funeral.

2:07:51.572 --> 2:07:53.092
Right.

2:07:53.192 --> 2:07:56.976
I had the strangest feeling when
I saw you that we have met before.

2:07:57.076 --> 2:07:59.227
It's called de javu.

2:07:59.228 --> 2:08:01.228
That's not it.

2:08:01.641 --> 2:08:03.293
It's as if...

2:08:03.393 --> 2:08:05.688
...all of this was in real.

2:08:07.435 --> 2:08:11.685
I'm sorry you must think
that I'm completely crazy.

2:08:12.384 --> 2:08:14.885
I'm not trying to flirt with you.

2:08:14.985 --> 2:08:16.509
I am widower myself.

2:08:16.609 --> 2:08:18.909
I... I'm sorry. I have to go.

2:08:19.009 --> 2:08:21.009
May be some other time.

2:08:26.259 --> 2:08:28.259
Nemo?

2:08:28.603 --> 2:08:31.464
I heard you were dead.
That you drowned.

2:08:31.564 --> 2:08:33.564
Drowned?

2:09:46.159 --> 2:09:49.332
Alert. Alert.
Meteors approaching.

2:09:50.371 --> 2:09:52.371
Don't panic.

2:09:53.062 --> 2:09:55.062
Alert. Alert.

2:10:13.581 --> 2:10:15.581
I wanna wake up.

2:10:16.737 --> 2:10:18.737
I wanna wake up.

2:10:18.797 --> 2:10:20.797
I wanna wake up.

2:10:21.998 --> 2:10:24.857
GAME OVER.

2:10:24.892 --> 2:10:26.892
Are you alright?

2:10:28.245 --> 2:10:30.245
Are you alright?

2:10:31.249 --> 2:10:34.135
When I say three,
you'll be awake.

2:10:35.235 --> 2:10:37.235
One...

2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:43.360
Two...

2:10:48.579 --> 2:10:50.579
Three.

2:11:03.232 --> 2:11:05.413
WAKE UP.......

2:11:36.278 --> 2:11:38.429
Mother.
- Do I know you?

2:11:39.416 --> 2:11:41.359
It's me.
- What do you want?

2:11:41.459 --> 2:11:44.179
Henry.
- It's me. Your son, Nemo.

2:11:44.318 --> 2:11:46.318
My son's just here.

2:11:47.953 --> 2:11:52.704
I don't know you. You're mad.
Now go away or I'll call the police.

2:11:52.804 --> 2:11:53.579
Mother.

2:11:53.679 --> 2:11:55.679
Mother.

2:12:11.363 --> 2:12:12.887
What do you see?

2:12:12.987 --> 2:12:15.136
He askes me what I see.

2:12:19.468 --> 2:12:21.779
I say, it's an ink stain.

2:12:22.711 --> 2:12:23.599
He says:

2:12:23.699 --> 2:12:25.867
You have to say more.

2:12:26.037 --> 2:12:29.862
I say, it's an ink stain on a sheet of paper.

2:12:30.550 --> 2:12:32.414
No.

2:12:32.514 --> 2:12:36.305
You have to say, what
goes through your mind.

2:12:40.837 --> 2:12:43.035
It makes me think of an inkwell.

2:12:43.135 --> 2:12:45.688
So he says: 'O'key...

2:12:46.767 --> 2:12:48.767
That's fine'.

2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:02.566
. evaeL. omeN

2:13:02.666 --> 2:13:05.417
You have until tomorrow to vote.

2:13:05.891 --> 2:13:06.792
Vote.

2:13:06.892 --> 2:13:08.846
And win a vacation on the Moon.

2:13:08.946 --> 2:13:10.946
For the whole family.

2:13:11.168 --> 2:13:13.168
Win a trip to the Moon.

2:13:13.580 --> 2:13:17.065
Take a swing at a fabulous golf vacation.

2:13:29.398 --> 2:13:33.223
Have they announced
the results of the voting?

2:13:33.357 --> 2:13:34.675
I'm sorry.

2:13:34.775 --> 2:13:37.492
At my age.

2:13:37.493 --> 2:13:41.280
The candles cost more than a cake.

2:13:45.387 --> 2:13:47.838
I'm not afraid of dying.

2:13:48.142 --> 2:13:51.457
I'm afraid I have'nt been alive enough.

2:13:54.603 --> 2:13:58.938
It should be written on every
schoolroom blackboard.

2:14:00.632 --> 2:14:03.375
Life is a playground.

2:14:04.942 --> 2:14:06.942
Or nothing.

2:14:10.579 --> 2:14:13.103
. evaeL. omeN

2:14:13.380 --> 2:14:14.005
Nemo. Leave.

2:14:14.105 --> 2:14:16.105
NOW

2:14:18.212 --> 2:14:21.424
Nemo. Leave. NOW

2:14:28.492 --> 2:14:30.492
Nemo.

2:14:46.438 --> 2:14:50.030
NEMO, READ THE NEWS.

2:15:00.778 --> 2:15:03.923
Tragic car accident on a country road

2:15:04.387 --> 2:15:06.527
Nemo turn to page 5

2:15:07.350 --> 2:15:10.240
Nemo look at the end of the street

2:15:12.650 --> 2:15:15.872
NEMO CALL
1235811321...

2:15:24.517 --> 2:15:27.917
Hello, who is this?
- Hello, who is this?

2:15:28.159 --> 2:15:30.159
Who is this?

2:15:30.434 --> 2:15:32.303
I was told to call this number.

2:15:32.403 --> 2:15:34.403
My name is Nemo Nobody.

2:15:36.167 --> 2:15:38.184
Is this some kind of a joke?

2:15:38.284 --> 2:15:40.284
No. No, I...

2:15:44.974 --> 2:15:46.236
Operator?
- Yes?

2:15:46.336 --> 2:15:50.231
I'd like the address to 1235811321.

2:15:51.228 --> 2:15:53.228
One moment please.

2:15:54.243 --> 2:15:56.443
12358 Alleway Street.

2:16:24.862 --> 2:16:26.862
Hello, Nemo.

2:16:27.082 --> 2:16:29.133
I'm glad you found me.

2:16:29.791 --> 2:16:32.703
All of this must seem
very complicated to you,

2:16:32.803 --> 2:16:35.523
but it's simpler than you think.

2:16:35.869 --> 2:16:39.014
Careful with the chair.
It is damaged.

2:16:44.876 --> 2:16:48.093
Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

2:16:50.247 --> 2:16:52.462
I should have warned you earlier but...

2:16:52.562 --> 2:16:55.297
I couldn't because of the transcript.

2:16:55.397 --> 2:16:56.912
The transcript?

2:16:57.012 --> 2:17:00.244
The text of our conversation.

2:17:02.569 --> 2:17:06.224
You can you hear me.
- What you are living now...

2:17:06.324 --> 2:17:08.324
...is the past.

2:17:08.927 --> 2:17:10.927
At least, for me.

2:17:12.641 --> 2:17:14.641
I am you...

2:17:15.005 --> 2:17:17.530
...70 years older.

2:17:19.201 --> 2:17:23.451
Everything you say, I said
myself when I was young.

2:17:23.506 --> 2:17:27.158
I only had to transcribe our conversation.

2:17:27.905 --> 2:17:30.171
It's all written right here.

2:17:30.271 --> 2:17:32.271
I can't...
- Believe it?

2:17:34.046 --> 2:17:36.046
For me...

2:17:36.270 --> 2:17:38.475
...time is inverted.

2:17:39.191 --> 2:17:41.652
I start at the end of the story...

2:17:41.752 --> 2:17:44.387
...and go toward the beginning.

2:17:44.633 --> 2:17:46.166
I don't understand.

2:17:46.266 --> 2:17:48.266
In this life here,

2:17:48.600 --> 2:17:50.756
you don't exist.

2:17:50.756 --> 2:17:52.756
I don't know why...

2:17:52.991 --> 2:17:55.217
Only the Architect knows.

2:17:56.855 --> 2:17:58.855
The Architect?

2:17:59.002 --> 2:18:01.002
The child...

2:18:01.373 --> 2:18:04.137
The one running after the train.

2:18:05.874 --> 2:18:08.594
Maybe your parents never met.

2:18:12.862 --> 2:18:17.714
Maybe your father died
in a sledging accident.

2:18:19.424 --> 2:18:21.656
Maybe you were one of the vast majority...

2:18:21.756 --> 2:18:27.366
...of those whose genetic code did not
reach its final destination.

2:18:29.895 --> 2:18:31.895
Maybe when she died...

2:18:32.404 --> 2:18:34.229
A prehistoric woman...

2:18:34.329 --> 2:18:39.089
She rolled off the line of heritance
to which you belong.

2:18:39.686 --> 2:18:41.686
So for this world...

2:18:44.212 --> 2:18:46.480
You don't exist.

2:18:47.980 --> 2:18:51.295
If the Anna's calculations are correct,

2:18:51.646 --> 2:18:58.255
you need to stay alive
untill 2092, February 12.

2:18:59.168 --> 2:19:02.001
5:50 AM.

2:19:34.522 --> 2:19:36.972
I'm sorry, I don't know how long
we haven't been recording.

2:19:37.072 --> 2:19:40.897
I have to submit my story
by tomorrow morning.

2:19:41.902 --> 2:19:45.387
Everything that you say is contradictory.

2:19:45.683 --> 2:19:49.994
You can't have been in one place
and another at the same time.

2:19:50.094 --> 2:19:54.284
You mean to say we have to make choices?

2:19:54.761 --> 2:19:57.396
Of all those lives,
which one...

2:19:57.781 --> 2:20:00.076
Which one is the right one?

2:20:00.114 --> 2:20:03.801
Each of these lives is the right one.

2:20:05.424 --> 2:20:10.109
Every path is the right path.

2:20:13.675 --> 2:20:17.974
'Everything could have been
anything else...

2:20:19.407 --> 2:20:23.944
...and it would have just as much meaning.'

2:20:26.129 --> 2:20:28.522
Tennessee Williams.

2:20:30.273 --> 2:20:32.529
You're too young for that.

2:20:32.892 --> 2:20:35.952
You can't be dead and still be here.

2:20:36.169 --> 2:20:38.169
You can't not exist.

2:20:43.950 --> 2:20:46.160
Is there life after death?

2:20:48.993 --> 2:20:50.993
After death...

2:20:53.990 --> 2:20:59.959
How can you be so sure you even exist?

2:21:10.108 --> 2:21:12.813
You don't exist.

2:21:14.346 --> 2:21:16.346
Neither do I.

2:21:19.119 --> 2:21:25.394
We only live in the imagination
of a nine year old child.

2:21:26.210 --> 2:21:30.448
We are imagined by a nine year old child,

2:21:31.373 --> 2:21:34.307
faced with an impossible choice.

2:21:44.042 --> 2:21:46.042
Run. Run.

2:21:51.663 --> 2:21:53.663
Nemo.

2:21:58.487 --> 2:22:00.487
Run.

2:22:04.836 --> 2:22:06.836
Run, Nemo.

2:22:08.902 --> 2:22:10.902
Nemo.

2:22:19.034 --> 2:22:20.915
I love you.

2:22:21.015 --> 2:22:23.015
Anna.

2:22:35.164 --> 2:22:37.164
Nemo.

2:22:45.779 --> 2:22:47.779
You're the one I love.

2:23:03.296 --> 2:23:05.296
In chess,

2:23:06.847 --> 2:23:09.563
it's called Zugzwang,

2:23:11.131 --> 2:23:13.526
when the only viable move...

2:23:19.022 --> 2:23:21.056
...is not to move.

2:23:30.939 --> 2:23:32.939
Come see.

2:23:56.209 --> 2:23:57.944
It's the sea.

2:23:58.044 --> 2:24:01.011
The child is taking it apart.

2:24:02.376 --> 2:24:04.671
He doesn't need it anymore.

2:24:05.851 --> 2:24:09.626
Before, he was unable to make a choice...

2:24:10.542 --> 2:24:13.681
'cause he didn't know what would happen.

2:24:13.781 --> 2:24:16.756
Now that he knows what will happen,

2:24:18.754 --> 2:24:21.355
he is unable to make a choice.

2:25:27.023 --> 2:25:29.023
Thank you, thank you.

2:25:29.115 --> 2:25:31.115
Thank you.

2:26:06.410 --> 2:26:12.019
This is the most beautiful day of my life.

2:26:21.244 --> 2:26:23.244
Anna.

2:26:25.904 --> 2:26:27.904
Anna.
