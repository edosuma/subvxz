00:02.753 --> 00:04.796
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:06.256 --> 00:09.217
- Ellstin Limehouse.
- Yeah, I heard of him.

00:09.301 --> 00:12.053
He owed Mama some kind of debt, okay?

00:12.137 --> 00:15.682
And that's why she knew
that he was gonna keep her money safe.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.434
Well, it has come to my attention
that you are in possession of something

00:18.519 --> 00:22.063
that belonged to Mags Bennett.

00:22.147 --> 00:25.817
Yeah, well, some agreements
transcend the grave, Mr. Crowder.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.985
If Dickie were to join Mags in the afterlife,

00:28.070 --> 00:32.073
that there would be no person
for that money to go to,

00:32.156 --> 00:33.574
except maybe you and me.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.410
So you get me that money,

00:35.494 --> 00:38.663
or life in here will take a turn
for the disastrous.

00:39.289 --> 00:45.169
How am I gonna get my hands on that money,
you think, while I am inside here?

00:46.422 --> 00:47.630
Detroit is concerned.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.716
Look, when you go back to Detroit,

00:49.842 --> 00:53.136
you just tell them that the properties
that I'm holding are poised to rebound,

00:53.220 --> 00:55.555
and when they do, they're gonna be worth
twice what I paid for them.

00:55.639 --> 00:58.641
You had a good thing going here, Emmitt.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.017
But you let go of the rope.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.980
Now, I told you what I'm offering.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.108
There ain't nothing more.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.197
Boyd.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.202
I'm in.

01:23.041 --> 01:27.545
Hey, Eye of the Tiger. How about you
settle down a little? Could be a while yet.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.964
Yeah, well, suppose I ain't got a while,
Tanner. What then?

01:30.048 --> 01:33.426
Listen, man, I don't know how they
do things up in Shitkick Holler.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.012
Down here in white civilization,

01:36.096 --> 01:40.433
boss calls you to his home, you sit
and wait till he's goddamn ready to see you.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.018
What's he even want with me, anyway?

01:42.603 --> 01:45.521
Devil, I'm taking you to see the wizard,
brother. Oughta be grateful.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.440
Where is he? Where is he?

01:50.694 --> 01:53.321
You must be the one they call Devil.

01:53.989 --> 01:58.451
So, Devil, can I get you a coffee
or a bourbon or anything?

01:58.535 --> 02:01.788
I am particular to the bourbon.
I love that shit. We don't get it in Detroit.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.790
No, I don't want anything.

02:03.999 --> 02:08.085
Nothing? I'm gonna help myself.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.464
Devil? Devil, Devil? Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.674
Why don't you just calm down
and have yourself a seat?

02:15.469 --> 02:19.096
So, Tanner here tells me that you are a man
who gets things done. Is he right?

02:20.516 --> 02:24.185
Well, I don't do muscle work anymore
if that's what you're after.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.312
Got my own thing going now.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.189
Not exactly the way
that I've heard it described.

02:28.524 --> 02:30.650
You been talking
out of school about me, Tanner?

02:30.734 --> 02:32.068
Just looking out is all.

02:32.277 --> 02:35.279
See, Tanner's kind of like my talent scout
for my organization.

02:35.364 --> 02:37.198
He finds people who are under-utilized

02:37.282 --> 02:39.242
in their current situation
and reports it back to me.

02:39.368 --> 02:42.829
And from what I've heard, you have been
pushed to a second tier position

02:42.913 --> 02:45.122
at an enterprise that's going nowhere fast.
Am I right?

02:45.207 --> 02:46.749
Yeah, I don't know about that.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.626
I only know what I've been told.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.921
You and Tanner go back.
You two got to talking.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.048
Quart of shine in my belly,
I say a lot of things.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.424
Here's what I think.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.885
The potential, down in Harlan County
to make money,

02:57.970 --> 02:59.512
you've only just begun to imagine,

02:59.596 --> 03:02.431
and there's only one thing standing
in the way of making that happening.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.144
Well, we got a few things lined up.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.523
Tell me you're shitting me.
Chasing money up a black holler?

03:10.607 --> 03:13.109
Cozying up with people
you'd just as soon see swinging?

03:13.694 --> 03:17.113
Taking orders from a woman
who has raised her hand to you

03:17.197 --> 03:20.074
and is protected by a man who is not
against taking a poke at you himself!

03:20.158 --> 03:23.870
Give me an amen! Give me an amen!
Give me a goddamn amen!

03:23.954 --> 03:24.954
Amen.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.164
What, are you saying
you got something better?

03:27.249 --> 03:28.833
I guaran-damn-tee it.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.669
"Guarantee's" a big word.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.629
You ain't the first to come along,
making promises.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.549
Yes, but I am the first
who can actually deliver.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.926
You see, I have the resources
and the infrastructure

03:39.011 --> 03:40.553
to turn your shitty little project,

03:40.637 --> 03:43.264
or whatever the hell you call it,
into a moneymaking machine.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.974
I just need the right people to run it.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.977
Right people. You're saying that's me?

03:48.061 --> 03:49.478
You wouldn't be here otherwise.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.025
Well, I don't know.

03:54.151 --> 03:58.696
You don't know. Hey, you don't know.
'Cause I'm not gonna bullshit you.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.449
It would take you getting your hands dirty,
but from what I understand,

04:01.533 --> 04:05.453
you're not against getting your hands dirty
if it's a means to an end that makes sense.

04:05.537 --> 04:11.918
Let me tell you this. This is an opportunity
that only happens once. Do you understand?

04:20.052 --> 04:24.430
Well, for the sake of argument,
what you got in mind?

04:36.068 --> 04:37.360
Dickie!

04:39.863 --> 04:41.030
Get off me!

04:41.198 --> 04:43.449
You big lug! Help!

04:43.700 --> 04:44.784
Dewey!

04:45.410 --> 04:47.870
Don't let 'em think they got you hurt, Dewey!

04:48.205 --> 04:50.706
Dickie! Help me!

04:51.833 --> 04:54.919
- Damn!
- Would you... Take it.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.587
Would you just hold still?

04:56.672 --> 04:57.630
Damn.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.131
What the hell are we supposed to do now?

04:59.383 --> 05:01.342
What do you mean,
what are we supposed to do now?

05:01.426 --> 05:04.845
The plan never accounted for this dipshit
to be in the mix.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.306
What? Dickie, you there?

05:07.391 --> 05:11.310
Hey, hey! Brother Dewey! Yeah, man.
Hey, have no fear. I'm right here.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.854
I think I'm in shock. I feel cold.

05:13.939 --> 05:18.275
Well, you never should've jumped in on the
fight, man. Had 'em right where I wanted 'em.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.903
What kind of man am I
if I don't stand by my friends?

05:21.363 --> 05:24.699
The fight was supposed to put him in here,
not you. You are now a liability.

05:24.783 --> 05:28.077
Damn, man. Can I at least get
like a Tylenol or something?

05:28.412 --> 05:29.495
Yeah, can you get him...

05:29.579 --> 05:30.746
I say we throw him back to gen pop.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.124
I say he's heard too much
for that to be a viable option.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.876
You really think this one's
gonna put two and two together?

05:35.961 --> 05:38.004
Hey, moron. How much have you heard?

05:38.463 --> 05:40.965
About y'all breaking out? Nothing.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.093
Do you hear this? Nice. Nice.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.389
He ain't nothing to worry about.
Come on. I mean, take a look at him.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.516
Nah, he can't go back in. Not now.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.520
Wait a sec. I got an idea.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.689
Ash, would you start loading us up?
I'm gonna handle this one.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.861
Hey, hey, ain't no reason to handle me.
I don't know anything.

06:02.237 --> 06:08.075
If you want, I could work up like a cover story
and you all can play along.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.869
What you think?

06:09.953 --> 06:10.995
Yeah. What's that right there?

06:11.997 --> 06:15.750
Hey! What the hell did you just do, man?
Dickie, help!

06:15.834 --> 06:20.963
What did you do? Dewey!
Hey, what did you do to him, man?

06:24.301 --> 06:29.221
Just another minute. There we go.
Time to go to sleep. Come on. Come on.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.807
Why the hell did you go and do that?
He said he didn't know nothing.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.935
So, you ready to do things my way,
or would you like option B?

07:08.929 --> 07:12.098
Let's see if I got this right.
You managed to get bushwhacked

07:12.182 --> 07:14.433
by an imbecile
and an undernourished half-cripple.

07:14.518 --> 07:17.770
I turned my back for one second. Next thing
I know, I wake up, I'm in the refrigerator.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.230
Gonna take all week
to get my core temp back up.

07:28.949 --> 07:33.327
Prison old-timer died in his sleep last night
and was awaiting transfer to the morgue.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.788
So they slipped out in a coroner's van?

07:35.872 --> 07:39.375
Well, Tramble's got its own
private hearse transfer. Subcontracted out.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.043
We got a line on the driver?

07:41.753 --> 07:44.463
Edward Fowler.
Worked for Tramble six months.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.006
BOLO's already out on the hearse,

07:46.091 --> 07:48.384
and the Marshals task force
will follow up on the other leads.

07:49.511 --> 07:54.348
Hey. My shift's been up for three hours,
and I'm gonna need stitches,

07:54.474 --> 07:55.724
and I can't really stitch it myself.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.018
Is there any chance I could cut loose
and head to urgent care soon?

07:58.103 --> 07:59.895
- Sit tight.
- Okay. All right.

08:04.943 --> 08:05.985
Any trouble?

08:06.069 --> 08:07.236
Not a peep.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.320
Good job.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.531
Sure. Hey, you think I can get a little taste?

08:31.761 --> 08:35.389
Nap time's over, Gimpy. Come on.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.226
Time for business.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.617
You just gonna let him freak out
inside that thing all day or what?

08:55.327 --> 08:57.453
Your boyfriend. You fix it.

08:58.955 --> 09:03.083
Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, hey, hey.
There you go.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.501
What the hell, man?

09:04.920 --> 09:08.214
There you go. Hey! Easy, easy, easy.

09:08.298 --> 09:12.593
Hey, look at me. Hey. Take a look around.
Take a look around.

09:12.719 --> 09:16.138
Come on. See what we got here?
You're free, brother.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.098
Free where? Where the hell am I?

09:18.183 --> 09:19.558
You're out of Tramble now.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.978
Why am I out of Tramble?
And which one of y'all stuck me in the neck?

09:23.188 --> 09:28.067
Your lucky day, Dewey. This thing goes right,
you may live as a free man.

09:28.151 --> 09:31.779
Serious? Well, awesome.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.490
Later.

09:35.992 --> 09:40.955
Funny, I said if things go well.
Did you get out okay?

09:41.581 --> 09:42.957
Got me on a short leash.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.084
He wanted to make sure
I went to the hospital and got stitches.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.169
Still don't know
why we need Dumb and Dumber both.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.547
You let me worry about Dumber.
You just worry about the other thing.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.759
All right. This is how this works.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.387
You got the money up blacktown.
That's where we're headed.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.389
No. Hold on.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.225
You need to know that you don't know
shit about Nobles Holler, all right?

10:01.309 --> 10:04.061
'Cause I can tell you we ain't
getting anywhere near that place

10:04.145 --> 10:05.604
with the whole crew we got going on here.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.314
That's why
it's just gonna be you and me, buttercup.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.735
You take him to the hotel. You wanted him.

10:11.820 --> 10:15.864
He's your problem.
Come on, gimp. Let's roll.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.538
Friends?

10:23.164 --> 10:24.790
Couple. You know.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.793
Still slinging weed?

10:28.586 --> 10:31.213
Mostly heroin. A little cocaine.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.886
Is that why you're here?
Marvel at the expansion of my drug empire?

10:38.179 --> 10:40.514
Yeah, I have been wondering
how you're doing.

10:41.141 --> 10:45.602
Well, here you see it,
in all its babysitting glory.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.438
But I need to ask you a question.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.070
Donnie, you put that down right this minute!

10:58.283 --> 10:59.408
What question?

11:00.910 --> 11:04.079
Mags Bennett may have a sizeable
amount of money socked away.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.498
Yeah?

11:06.583 --> 11:07.541
Yeah.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.751
How much?

11:09.294 --> 11:10.336
Can't say.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.172
"Can't say" you don't know
or "can't say" you can't say?

11:13.256 --> 11:14.423
Bit of both.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.758
You gonna ask do I have it?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.926
Was just gonna ask
if you knew where she kept it.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.345
Couldn't say.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.431
"Couldn't say" don't know
or "couldn't say" couldn't say?

11:24.851 --> 11:26.185
Well, why couldn't I have it?

11:27.145 --> 11:29.146
I think if you did,
you'd quit the babysitting gig.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.858
Well, maybe I'm doing this babysitting gig
to throw off the authorities.

11:35.945 --> 11:39.031
Loretta, do you have it?

11:42.827 --> 11:48.832
Got it. Okay. Thanks. Found the hearse
off 225. Driver shot once through the head,

11:48.917 --> 11:52.211
two empty body bags in the back
plus the old-timer they used to get out.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.004
They got an accomplice outside.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.673
Or they had a gun ready.
Come time to make a deal with the driver,

11:56.758 --> 11:58.342
they put a bullet through him instead.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.844
Anyways, you were explaining
where we're going?

12:00.929 --> 12:02.304
Nobles Holler.

12:02.389 --> 12:06.725
Nice community. Carved out
for emancipated slaves after the Civil War.

12:06.810 --> 12:10.813
Good white folks of the county been trying
to dig 'em out going on 150 years now.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.106
Hasn't happened yet?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.649
They're still working on it.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.651
You're all up on your race relations.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.237
I pay attention during Black History Month.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.407
And you're bringing me along as the
ambassador of African-America.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.699
Help smooth your passage.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.953
I recall being pulled along
on a similar mission sometime back.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.371
Fair enough.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.751
If the girl's right, Mags kept her money
there. Fellow named Ellstin Limehouse.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.336
You know this Limehouse?

12:35.338 --> 12:37.047
No. Met him once.

12:37.507 --> 12:40.134
And you think Dickie's fool enough
to show up there looking for it?

12:40.218 --> 12:44.555
Fool enough to bring along Dewey Crowe.
I'd say anything's possible.

12:58.445 --> 13:02.573
Mr. Limehouse. Deputy Marshal Givens.
Deputy Marshal Brooks.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.077
Givens? Boy, something about that name.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.662
Remembering my daddy, I expect.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.081
Why? He do something
worth me remembering him?

13:11.332 --> 13:12.916
You put it that way, no.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.960
Well, then why would I remember him?

13:18.214 --> 13:21.467
We're here about two local boys.
Dickie Bennett and Dewey Crowe.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.052
Busted out of the pen
at Tramble this morning.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.804
Who in the hell is Dewey Crowe?

13:25.889 --> 13:29.933
Wears gator teeth. Joined the Heil Hitler club.
Wants you to know he's bad,

13:30.018 --> 13:31.685
but doesn't have it down yet.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.812
We have to pretend
you don't know Dickie Bennett?

13:35.565 --> 13:39.651
Word is Bennetts' been keeping their cash
up this holler a long time,

13:39.736 --> 13:41.487
and Dickie, being out,
he's gonna need a friend.

13:41.863 --> 13:42.988
And you think I'm that friend?

13:43.072 --> 13:47.075
Mr. Limehouse, any information you might
have on Dickie or the money he's after...

13:47.160 --> 13:51.705
Where is your family tree, girl? Trying to
cover it up, but I hear Tennessee up in there.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.165
You hear right.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.751
Now, down Tennessee,
your people teach you the way to get ahead

13:55.835 --> 13:58.545
is betraying the confidence of folk
you got dealings with?

13:58.630 --> 14:02.007
Taught me to be careful who I choose
to do business with in the first place.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.718
Well, you got luxuries up there
we ain't got down here.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.053
I didn't know you were from Tennessee.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.263
Hendersonville,
up near Johnny Cash's place.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.348
Ever see him?

14:09.432 --> 14:10.682
Nah, I never made it up that way.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.477
Ended up helping my mama
clean house for a white lady.

14:13.645 --> 14:17.272
Said I needed to go to college.
Paid my way. Four years at Ole Miss.

14:18.107 --> 14:22.402
I believe Ole Miss has the best-looking girls
any college in the country, even Vanderbilt.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.404
Well, you two clearly got a lot to talk about.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.697
We're not done with you, yet.

14:27.408 --> 14:31.203
You know, I'd love to help you, Marshals,
but these ribs is done.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.123
But y'all can bring your revenue agents
down here if you want to

14:35.250 --> 14:39.545
with their guns and their dogs.
Won't be the first time nor the last, I expect.

14:39.629 --> 14:43.465
We can start by posting up on your road
into town. Keep an eye out for Dickie.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.385
I'm sure you won't mind
since you got nothing to hide.

14:46.719 --> 14:51.139
If you get hungry, you come on up.
I'm gonna hook you up with some bacon.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.225
You ain't ever gonna forget.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.899
We get KSP to post a unit up here.

15:00.984 --> 15:04.236
You mind if I leave you with them?
Sit in the A/C?

15:04.320 --> 15:05.737
Well, where are you going?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.490
Another idea I want to run down.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.792
How the hell did the Marshal Service
get posted up here already?

15:20.253 --> 15:21.920
Did you tip them off, Dickie?

15:22.005 --> 15:24.840
Yeah, yeah, I tipped off Raylan
about my own escape.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.509
What can I say? It really felt right at the time.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.389
Shit! Well, we are not getting up there.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.849
Well, that is surely true.

15:34.892 --> 15:35.892
Where are we going now?

15:35.977 --> 15:37.603
To the motel. If I can't get up there,

15:37.687 --> 15:39.896
you're gonna find a way
to get the goddamn money out.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.709
What happened?

16:01.210 --> 16:02.878
No joy. Give me a phone.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.298
Hello, Dickie Bennett.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.216
You two know each other?

16:09.010 --> 16:12.554
Sure we do. We got family in Harlan.

16:13.556 --> 16:18.644
We know all the Bennetts, matter of fact,
not just this sorry shit-heap.

16:18.770 --> 16:24.524
Hey, hey, hey. Ain't no reason to get
all spun up there, tater tot.

16:24.901 --> 16:28.570
You call your banker. You tell him
to bring that money someplace useful,

16:28.655 --> 16:30.739
or I will show you
what it means to get "spun up."

16:31.741 --> 16:33.575
Okay. Here we go.

16:36.663 --> 16:43.126
It's ringing. Yeah, hello? This is, I'm a very
special friend and client of Mr. Limehouse.

16:43.211 --> 16:46.213
If you would please put him on the phone
right straightaway, thank you.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.758
Say what? No, that... Hello?

16:55.098 --> 16:58.767
It's okay. I'm just gonna do something here.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.356
You know he's just gonna keep on calling.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.607
Yeah, give it here.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.361
Now, before you say a damn word,

17:09.444 --> 17:11.696
I need to know
you know how to talk on a telephone.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.450
Listen, listen, you know that I do,
and you know I wouldn't be calling

17:15.535 --> 17:17.160
if it wasn't something needed done, okay?

17:17.537 --> 17:20.122
I assume you are aware
of the situation up here.

17:20.205 --> 17:25.711
Yes, I am aware, and let me just say, okay,
that I wish all this could be handled

17:25.795 --> 17:28.714
in some other way, but since it can't,
here's the thing.

17:29.298 --> 17:33.593
I am counting on you, okay? I'm counting on
your sterling reputation for customer service,

17:33.678 --> 17:39.099
not to mention our family's long
and mutually beneficial history

17:39.183 --> 17:44.104
to prevail upon you to honor
the arrangement between us, okay?

17:44.188 --> 17:47.107
And, given the current circumstances,

17:47.191 --> 17:52.529
I'm gonna need you to bring
the package to some other location.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.364
Yeah. Okay.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.367
Well, if it ain't the Devil himself.

17:58.453 --> 17:59.828
Where the hell you been, brother?

18:00.872 --> 18:02.122
Been around.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.206
Around?

18:03.332 --> 18:05.250
Yeah. What? I miss something?

18:05.960 --> 18:10.380
Just your share. Johnny had his eyes on it,
but I was able to fend him off.

18:13.885 --> 18:14.926
This it?

18:15.011 --> 18:17.304
What, you were expecting
a prize at the bottom?

18:17.388 --> 18:20.015
No, it's just a little light is all.

18:20.183 --> 18:22.225
Just watering seeds, son.
Just watering seeds.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.102
Yeah, you been telling me that, haven't you?

18:24.187 --> 18:25.645
What the hell you so crotchety about, Devil?

18:25.897 --> 18:29.107
Nothing. Just wondering if and when
we're ever gonna actually make a move

18:29.192 --> 18:30.358
on something worth moving on.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.860
And I told you that time is coming.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.113
But we're gonna
have to put a pin in this for now

18:35.198 --> 18:37.115
'cause I'm sensing a disturbance in the force.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.492
Boyd?

18:38.993 --> 18:40.202
Hello, Raylan!

18:43.873 --> 18:44.915
Welcome!

18:44.999 --> 18:46.708
I like what you've done with the place.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.712
Well, I appreciate that.
What can we do for you, Raylan?

18:51.255 --> 18:54.216
We have 17 different kinds
of bourbon behind the bar.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.426
We'll even give you
the first one on the house.

18:56.511 --> 18:57.761
How many kinds of water?

18:57.887 --> 18:59.221
Give him some tap.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.680
And where's Arlo?

19:00.765 --> 19:03.391
Are you saying I know the whereabouts
of your daddy better than you do?

19:03.476 --> 19:06.895
Saying I can't see him passing up
the chance to drink off a weekday afternoon.

19:07.230 --> 19:11.024
Prostate. It makes it hard for him
to piss whatever he takes in.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.611
Well, you know what they say.
Getting old ain't for pussies.

19:14.737 --> 19:15.695
Yeah.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.906
Your daddy's slipping into decrepitude.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.575
Truly is sad, being the man that he once was.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.578
He was something.
Hard on my mother, though.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.705
He'd lay bruises on her when he'd drink

19:25.790 --> 19:30.210
or when he didn't. I was 10
the night she decided she'd had enough.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.130
Lit out, took a clutch with her
like she wasn't coming back.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.924
And did she go up to Nobles Holler?

19:36.008 --> 19:42.055
Heard the stories, white women seeking
shelter there, men not daring to follow them.

19:42.181 --> 19:46.309
But not Arlo. Hell no!
He wasn't scared of black folks.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.186
He was gonna chase her down
and bring her back.

19:48.271 --> 19:52.065
'Course, he tied one on first
and then come up and dragged me with.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.693
How did that sit
with the good folks in Nobles Holler?

19:54.777 --> 19:58.488
We come up to the bridge.
Arlo set to screaming for her.

19:58.948 --> 20:03.910
And that's when I met Ellstin Limehouse.
Young man then, 20, 22.

20:03.995 --> 20:07.539
Arlo reached back
about as far as Nebraska to swing at him.

20:09.500 --> 20:14.838
Limehouse just felled him like a tree.
He beat him so bad,

20:14.922 --> 20:17.215
I had to drag him back to the car
and drive him home.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.635
Well, that must have made
quite an impression,

20:20.720 --> 20:22.220
seeing your daddy laid low like that.

20:22.305 --> 20:26.600
And yeah, I was up
at Nobles Holler this afternoon.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.728
Limehouse, no recollection of it whatsoever,

20:29.812 --> 20:31.104
like it never happened.

20:32.815 --> 20:36.651
Well, maybe he just found it interesting
to allow you to believe that.

20:38.237 --> 20:42.115
Maybe. Or maybe
he's kicked so many white boys' asses,

20:42.283 --> 20:45.785
he just ain't keeping track no more.
What do you think?

20:48.122 --> 20:49.915
Hey, boys. Would you mind giving me

20:49.999 --> 20:52.792
and US Deputy Marshal Raylan Givens
a moment, please?

20:55.713 --> 20:57.088
Come on, Devil.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.386
I'd love to know
what precipitated that conversation

21:03.471 --> 21:05.096
between you and Mr. Limehouse.

21:07.266 --> 21:12.729
Well, Dickie Bennett took a flyer
out of Tramble this morning.

21:13.147 --> 21:14.272
He did not?

21:14.357 --> 21:17.108
His compadre in escape
none other than Dewey Crowe.

21:17.652 --> 21:18.652
Dewey Crowe?

21:18.736 --> 21:20.654
I don't suppose they've been by.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.491
No, no, they have not,
and I think we can both agree

21:24.575 --> 21:26.952
that if he's running around with Dickie,
I'm unlikely to receive him.

21:27.036 --> 21:31.498
No. More likely you go after them.
Which would be easier

21:31.582 --> 21:35.585
if you knew where they were,
even if it was in prison.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.133
All right. I might have a nut
or two for your trail mix.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.843
I'm listening.

21:43.928 --> 21:47.013
A bent screw at Tramble, the kind of guy
who put people together

21:47.098 --> 21:51.226
who ain't supposed to be. He might be the
same kind of guy who can get them out.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.355
<i>Yeah? What can I do for you?</i>

21:55.439 --> 21:58.441
<i>The Slayton gang rode past here last night,
heading south. I'd like some help...</i>

21:58.526 --> 22:00.193
You still think he's gonna call?

22:02.405 --> 22:03.738
I say we do the other thing.

22:03.823 --> 22:04.823
Not yet.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.325
Yeah, we don't need Combs and Junior
around for that.

22:07.410 --> 22:08.660
The kind of money that you're talking about

22:08.744 --> 22:11.121
is pauper's wages
compared to what we're gonna get.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.956
- If the man ever calls.
- He'll call.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.374
Hey, man, I don't mean to complain,

22:14.458 --> 22:17.168
but I got a serious hunger thing
going on over here.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.921
Hey, man, why don't you just
shut your mouth and watch TV?

22:20.006 --> 22:22.382
Hey. Look. I haven't eaten all day, either.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.384
And I've got stitches,
so I'm not going anywhere.

22:24.552 --> 22:27.220
Are you going out? Get some chicken.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.348
- Yeah, I want chicken.
- Daddy, you want some chicken?

22:30.433 --> 22:31.850
Dickie, we're getting chicken.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.020
Hey, this is your idea.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.396
No coleslaw!

22:45.698 --> 22:47.282
Johnny.

22:47.742 --> 22:50.952
Damn, Devil, what the hell you doing
lurking around back here?

22:52.079 --> 22:53.830
Just waiting, hoping for a word.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.876
A word? Gonna shed some light
on why you been all jinked up lately?

22:57.960 --> 23:00.545
Only $360, that's what's got me all jinked up.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.048
It is what it is, Devil.
You can blame the economy.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.300
Blame belongs one place,
and you and I both know where.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.763
What are you driving at, Devil?

23:11.265 --> 23:15.977
I remember after you got shot,
I come visit you at the VA hospital.

23:16.687 --> 23:20.315
I remember you saying,
"Boyd put me here. Put me in this chair."

23:21.525 --> 23:23.151
Well, I was on a lot of meds at the time.

23:23.235 --> 23:28.448
$360. That enough
to put all that behind you?

23:29.366 --> 23:31.201
Well, he's helped out since.

23:31.285 --> 23:36.915
Yeah? How? Got you your bar back?
Hallelujah. What else, Johnny?

23:36.999 --> 23:38.833
You name me one thing that's worth a shit.

23:39.001 --> 23:42.670
Yeah, okay! Look, I'm not gonna deny,
sitting in this goddamn chair,

23:42.755 --> 23:44.255
that I ain't never had that thought before.

23:44.340 --> 23:51.137
Hey, look. There's a time I believed in
Boyd Crowder. I did, with everything I had.

23:51.722 --> 23:56.184
But the Boyd we have today is not the man
I believed in, not by a long shot.

23:57.311 --> 24:02.398
Look at us, Johnny.
You and me, right connections,

24:03.359 --> 24:06.528
there ain't any limits
on what we can do down here.

24:09.156 --> 24:14.702
Well, I will grant you that.
But, Devil, just how do you think

24:14.870 --> 24:17.080
we're gonna get our hands
on those right connections?

24:19.333 --> 24:24.045
I got a line on that already.
Putting together a meeting for tomorrow.

24:24.839 --> 24:27.257
Gonna put us in some real deep pockets.

24:29.385 --> 24:30.510
How deep?

24:35.850 --> 24:37.058
Listen, Johnny.

24:42.523 --> 24:48.194
I'll tell you anything you want to know.
But I got to know you got my back.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.079
Start talking, Devil.

24:59.039 --> 25:03.751
Is there any way you can get me just a little
closer or something?

25:05.462 --> 25:10.967
I'm at the location. I said I'm at the location.
My question...

25:27.067 --> 25:28.443
How are you doing, Ash?

25:29.737 --> 25:30.737
Marshal.

25:32.615 --> 25:35.033
Why don't you put your food down,
and we'll have a word?

26:20.913 --> 26:22.413
Let's go.

26:26.669 --> 26:27.961
Ash, you all right?

26:28.045 --> 26:30.380
No! You ran me over, you son of a bitch!

26:30.464 --> 26:32.757
Yeah, technically you rolled over me,
and then I backed into you,

26:32.841 --> 26:34.634
but you were brandishing
a pistol both times.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.718
I think you broke my leg.

26:35.803 --> 26:38.930
I'm gonna break both your legs you don't
tell me where you were going with that food.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.684
Call an ambulance, man.
I am jacked up. Come on!

26:45.312 --> 26:46.896
Don't leave me. Don't leave...

26:47.022 --> 26:48.106
Don't go far.

27:22.558 --> 27:28.604
Did you see that? They just left you.
You know where they're going?

27:29.064 --> 27:30.481
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:32.067 --> 27:35.486
Does your stomach hurt?
Could be bleeding inside.

27:35.571 --> 27:39.365
Most likely spleen. That's okay.
You can pretty much live without a spleen

27:39.450 --> 27:43.077
as long as they get it out before
it goes septic. If that shit happens...

27:43.871 --> 27:47.915
No bars. So hard to get cell phone service
in these holler roads.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.250
Use the one in the hotel room.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.169
Use the phone in the hotel room.

27:53.589 --> 27:59.218
Yeah. I just feel bad about leaving you again.
You know, in case you die.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.554
Nobody wants to die alone, do they?

28:01.638 --> 28:03.264
- Fine!
- No?

28:03.766 --> 28:06.976
But you got to promise me that,
no matter what happens with them,

28:07.061 --> 28:10.271
no matter how weird this thing gets,
you say I cooperated.

28:10.356 --> 28:13.441
I'm sorry. What does that mean,
"How weird things might get?"

28:18.739 --> 28:20.406
Let's go.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.617
Now what?

28:22.743 --> 28:23.785
Get up.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.955
Look, he told the banker to take the money
to his mother's store, okay?

28:28.082 --> 28:31.417
So you guys take Dickie up to the store,
pick up the money, okay?

28:31.627 --> 28:33.127
Dewey, you're gonna stay with me.

28:33.587 --> 28:40.176
He said he would call when the money is
there, and he ain't called. Has he called?

28:40.761 --> 28:41.928
You're a smart guy. Figure it out.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.472
There ain't nothing to figure out
beyond what's already been figured out.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.182
Look. Hey, listen to me. Ash is gone.
There's a new plan.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.683
When the money is there!

28:48.310 --> 28:51.312
Either your man gets the money to the store
on time, or you get dead.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.397
What about me?

28:52.481 --> 28:54.941
I've got a bigger plan for you, okay?
Or is that gonna be a problem, too?

28:55.025 --> 28:56.776
Supposing you tell me
what it is before I answer?

28:56.860 --> 28:58.069
- What do you think?
- Would you just...

28:58.153 --> 28:59.195
Shut up.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.782
- Call when the money is there.
- Would you please run him down?

29:05.452 --> 29:08.162
- Get your ass in the car.
- Go, Dewey!

29:11.458 --> 29:13.000
- Look out!
- I'll get it.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.556
Can't let you through.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.640
Come on now.

29:27.724 --> 29:30.309
I need you to three-point this truck and
send it on back up the holler.

29:30.394 --> 29:31.978
- Miss, I...
- Deputy Marshal Brooks.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.105
Deputy Marshal Brooks, excuse me.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.983
This truck is carrying pig shit
and pig shit only.

29:37.067 --> 29:40.319
Yeah, your delivery's gonna be a little late.
Feel free to blame me.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.613
So that's how it is, then?

29:42.698 --> 29:43.948
That's how it is.

29:44.032 --> 29:49.996
Let me start again, okay?
This is our livelihood.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.082
Whatever you got with Limehouse,
is with Limehouse.

29:53.584 --> 29:56.210
Alls I'm asking is for passage
of a truckload of pig manure.

29:56.336 --> 29:59.213
The only way this truck leaves here
is if we go through every inch of it,

29:59.298 --> 30:02.133
get an all-clear from Lexington,
and then maybe.

30:03.844 --> 30:05.887
You did hear me say what I'm hauling, right?

30:07.014 --> 30:10.183
I'm ready to get dirty. Are you?

30:15.731 --> 30:17.190
Y'all have a good night.

30:23.363 --> 30:27.575
Ash says Dickie's got a deal with Limehouse.
The money's gonna be at the Bennett store.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.662
Well, one of Limehouse's men
tried to slip out a fertilizer truck.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.081
I sent him back.
The money could've been in there.

30:34.750 --> 30:39.086
Well, if so, the money's not gonna be there,
and like as not, they're gonna kill Dickie.

30:39.463 --> 30:40.463
Shit!

30:40.797 --> 30:41.797
What?

30:41.882 --> 30:44.091
Goddamn if I don't have
to save Dickie Bennett.

30:47.012 --> 30:51.766
See, Dickie, when that Black Pike shit
went down, what your mama did after,

30:51.850 --> 30:56.103
selling all those folks out that believed
in you, that crossed the line of decency

30:56.188 --> 30:57.396
as far as I'm concerned.

30:57.481 --> 31:01.359
Hold on. Say that part again, the part
about crossing a line of some kind.

31:01.443 --> 31:02.693
The line of decency.

31:02.778 --> 31:08.115
Now, isn't that a wee bit ironic coming from
a fella holding a gun on an unarmed man?

31:08.534 --> 31:12.537
Yeah, you see, Dickie, I volunteered to come
out here for one reason and one reason only.

31:12.955 --> 31:16.832
See, 'cause I thought it would be fun
to put a bullet in you and watch you die.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.919
Let's go. Come on.

31:22.589 --> 31:23.965
March, gimp!

31:30.013 --> 31:33.307
Come here. What's the holdup?

31:35.435 --> 31:40.523
Well, it just gives me pause, Junior,
to see how far the mighty have fallen.

31:42.067 --> 31:45.069
No shit. Come on.

31:46.989 --> 31:48.114
Let's go.

31:49.491 --> 31:54.245
Say there's some money in here,
how about you get to it?

31:54.371 --> 31:56.539
Why don't you just... Easy.

32:08.010 --> 32:09.427
Ain't looking too good, is it?

32:09.678 --> 32:14.181
Just hold on, hold it. Let me just keep...
May I keep looking for one second?

32:19.187 --> 32:20.521
Second's up, Dickie.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.357
Wait! Okay? I got something here. Just...

32:30.198 --> 32:31.949
How about that shit?

32:32.075 --> 32:34.243
- Well, I'll be goddamned.
- Yeah.

32:34.328 --> 32:35.786
Daddy, look at this.

32:37.414 --> 32:38.414
Open it.

32:39.666 --> 32:40.708
You...

32:40.834 --> 32:41.917
Come on. You heard him.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.461
- You want me to...
- Open it.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.338
Hey. Take it easy.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.594
Hello, baby. Here we go.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.012
Hold on.

32:54.890 --> 33:00.770
Daddy, suppose he got a gun hidden up in
there, come out blasting? Look at us then.

33:01.438 --> 33:05.316
Hey! Junior, fine! That's fine.
Why don't you go right on ahead?

33:05.400 --> 33:08.194
You open it yourself.
Yeah, go on. It's all right.

33:08.278 --> 33:11.197
What, and then you got a booby trap in there
and I get my face blown off?

33:12.366 --> 33:17.870
One of us needs to open the cooler,
if we're gonna see what's inside!

33:17.954 --> 33:18.954
I know that.

33:19.081 --> 33:20.247
- Well?
- Shut up! Let me think.

33:20.374 --> 33:23.876
God's sake, boy. Put your gun on his neck,
stand back, and have him open it.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.753
I got to tell you everything?

33:25.879 --> 33:27.213
Does he have to tell you everything?

33:27.297 --> 33:29.006
Shut up! Open it, shit-heel!

33:29.091 --> 33:30.091
Okay. Okay.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.606
Holy shit!

33:45.774 --> 33:46.982
What?

33:57.411 --> 33:59.870
Clear down here. Come on down.

34:02.791 --> 34:03.958
Limehouse.

34:04.751 --> 34:10.047
I got to tell... This man right... I got
to tell you, you had me a wee bit worried.

34:10.132 --> 34:13.300
Your friends in the Marshal Service?
Now, they sure can be watchful.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.637
We had to fly that stuff out here
in an old Underground Railroad trail.

34:17.139 --> 34:20.349
Well, these two right here...
How you like me now?

34:20.475 --> 34:22.560
These two right here
were gonna put me down either way,

34:22.643 --> 34:26.063
so I got to tell you something right here
right now. I thank you.

34:27.190 --> 34:31.569
Okay, here's the thing.
Got one question for you.

34:31.820 --> 34:38.409
This, right here, is this a teaser bag and you
got the money all split up, safe and sound?

34:38.493 --> 34:39.659
No, that's it.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.956
That's it? That's it, meaning...

34:44.040 --> 34:45.498
That's all they got left, Dickie.

34:50.088 --> 34:54.632
There's supposed to be $3 million in here,
Limehouse. Way north of $3 million.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.552
You know. Come on.

34:56.636 --> 34:59.430
Look, it's all spent,
except what you see right there.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.640
That's $46,313.

35:01.767 --> 35:05.811
And receipts accounting for every single
penny that your mama spent,

35:05.896 --> 35:08.939
buying mostly property for that mine deal.

35:09.065 --> 35:12.151
Hell no. Mama, looking down,
she knows that this ain't right.

35:12.235 --> 35:15.362
Dickie. We done.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.367
Limehouse!

35:24.831 --> 35:27.958
I believe the terms of the deal
are I receive the money

35:28.043 --> 35:30.252
and then we are through, isn't that right?

35:30.378 --> 35:32.213
That's right. Those are the terms.

35:37.344 --> 35:42.014
Then you take it back. Just go on.
I do not accept this.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.685
What exactly is you aiming to do out here
in this world with no money, son?

35:46.770 --> 35:50.147
You don't need to worry
about what I'm gonna do, okay?

35:50.232 --> 35:52.691
What you can worry about,
if it ain't too much to ask,

35:52.776 --> 35:54.819
you could lend me a shotgun.
How about that?

35:58.740 --> 36:02.076
No, go ahead. Dump it. Give it to him.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.174
You good with this, Mr. Bennett?

36:19.094 --> 36:24.306
Are we good? Are we good?
Can you not tell?

36:24.891 --> 36:29.854
Why don't you just go on? Go on.
Get your... It's got handles there.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.523
Just go on. Just leave me here
with all my nothing!

36:33.441 --> 36:38.320
I want you to make that money have babies.
I want to see it back where it belongs!

36:39.865 --> 36:43.617
Hey! I will come for it! You hear me?

36:45.871 --> 36:47.121
<i>How far behind me are you?</i>

36:47.247 --> 36:49.623
Ten? You going in or are you gonna wait?

36:54.796 --> 36:56.338
Yeah, I'm gonna go in.

37:09.019 --> 37:15.274
Raylan Givens. Hey, there, Raylan.
Hey, you know what?

37:16.401 --> 37:19.737
I hereby surrender, Raylan. You got me.

37:21.031 --> 37:22.281
What the hell, Dickie?

37:23.199 --> 37:27.036
Well, you know, the thing is,
I really had no choice, Raylan.

37:27.287 --> 37:31.248
They forced me into it. You see,
the escape, the money, the whole thing.

37:31.333 --> 37:34.877
To be very clear, Raylan, I am the victim here.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.254
Yeah, that much is clear.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.590
And Dewey Crowe,
he can back up every word.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.259
Where is Dewey Crowe?

37:49.142 --> 37:53.687
I still don't see why I got to be bound.
I'm a wanted fugitive. Where am I gonna go?

37:57.359 --> 37:58.943
Why don't you loosen these up?

37:59.027 --> 38:01.487
I've been here hours like this.
I can't feel my feet.

38:03.907 --> 38:08.327
You're right. It's been too long.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.871
If things are going to plan,
we would've heard by now.

38:12.082 --> 38:13.958
So now we got to do the other thing.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.251
Wait. What other thing?

38:18.630 --> 38:24.134
Hey. No, no! Come on, no! No!

38:24.594 --> 38:28.138
No! Come on, no! No! No!

38:28.223 --> 38:30.224
No! No! No!

38:31.810 --> 38:33.227
There we go.

38:35.313 --> 38:39.525
Get some rest, Dewey Crowe.
You're gonna need it.

38:45.448 --> 38:51.954
Hey. I got one. No, no, I just got the one.
But, hey, before you get in the car,

38:52.747 --> 38:56.041
I may have a way for us
to make some more money. Yeah.

39:06.136 --> 39:07.386
Hey, Boyd.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.557
We got to talk.

39:12.851 --> 39:16.478
Well, come on in, Devil. Have a seat. Johnny.

39:20.108 --> 39:25.446
Why are you so serious?
Is this a good meeting or a bad meeting?

39:25.655 --> 39:28.907
This is a come-to-Jesus meeting, Boyd.

39:30.285 --> 39:33.078
Well, is that a note of veiled menace
I detect in your voice, Devil?

39:34.289 --> 39:36.123
You hear it however you need to.

39:40.503 --> 39:43.630
Johnny, what's this about?

39:43.715 --> 39:45.466
Look at me, Boyd.

39:49.596 --> 39:51.180
It's been coming a long time.

39:55.393 --> 40:00.564
Well, Devil, this road
you seem bent on taking,

40:00.648 --> 40:02.983
once you go down it,
there ain't no coming back.

40:04.319 --> 40:07.112
Now, I'm offering you a way out here.
You choose to take it.

40:07.197 --> 40:12.326
Yeah, save it. There ain't any way
you talk yourself out of this.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.916
What line did they take with you, son?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.126
They tell you, why be the man
sitting beside the man

40:21.211 --> 40:23.921
when you can be the man?

40:24.005 --> 40:28.842
Now, don't you know that you are
jumping out of the frying pan into the fire?

40:32.347 --> 40:33.806
I guess we'll see, won't we?

40:40.188 --> 40:43.023
Well, I guess there's nothing left
to do, then, but to do it.

40:43.316 --> 40:44.691
I guess not.

40:48.196 --> 40:51.782
One more thing.
An indulgence, if you'll allow me.

40:58.540 --> 41:05.212
Devil, knowing me the way that you do,
whatever led you in your imagination

41:05.296 --> 41:07.381
to believe that you could pull this off?

41:08.591 --> 41:09.758
Johnny, what the...

41:09.843 --> 41:11.718
It ain't never gonna happen, Devil.
You should've known that.

41:11.845 --> 41:13.178
- Devil.
- Wait! Wait!

41:19.602 --> 41:23.313
All I ever asked for was your loyalty.
Was I not entitled to that,

41:23.398 --> 41:25.149
after everything that we've been through?

41:27.443 --> 41:31.697
I know how much it hurts.
I've been right where you are,

41:33.032 --> 41:36.660
laid out on the ground and holding my chest,
looking up at the ceiling...

41:38.079 --> 41:43.375
Trying to find my breath.
Devil, I was lucky I made it back.

41:45.879 --> 41:47.546
Son, you ain't gonna make it back.

41:51.801 --> 41:53.594
You want some help with the pain?

42:03.438 --> 42:05.272
You close your eyes, son.
