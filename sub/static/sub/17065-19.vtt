WEBVTT

00:02.397 --> 00:04.960
Ooh! You look just like Kate Middleton.

00:05.049 --> 00:06.115
I realize that.

00:06.195 --> 00:08.061
But I'm still not wearing this dumb hat,

00:08.147 --> 00:10.113
because I'm not going
to the stupid polo match.

00:10.149 --> 00:12.315
This is my charity event
for the community,

00:12.367 --> 00:14.201
and you are part of that
community, and you are going.

00:14.286 --> 00:16.169
Mnh-mnh. I'm not part of the community.

00:16.254 --> 00:18.605
I just happen to live in the community.

00:18.690 --> 00:20.539
What's the charity, Doris?

00:20.776 --> 00:22.108
I don't know.

00:22.194 --> 00:24.494
Horses? Orphans? AIDS?

00:24.546 --> 00:27.013
God, I hope it's not for something
boring, like the environment.

00:27.099 --> 00:30.400
- We should go, honey. It'd be fun.
- Greg, please. Don't make me leave you.

00:30.435 --> 00:32.509
I'm too unmotivated
to get a revenge body.

00:33.572 --> 00:36.072
Doris, I just don't like fancy events.

00:36.158 --> 00:37.340
It's not who I am.

00:37.376 --> 00:38.675
I like to be comfortable.

00:38.727 --> 00:40.594
So while you're out playing horsies,

00:40.679 --> 00:43.196
I'll be at home, covered in a blanket.

00:43.282 --> 00:45.615
And yes... probably popcorn.

00:48.420 --> 00:49.870
Oliver's going.

00:49.955 --> 00:52.305
Doris offered to let me
cut the ceremonial ribbon

00:52.391 --> 00:53.523
at the polo match.

00:53.559 --> 00:55.408
Why?! You hate him.

00:55.494 --> 00:57.427
I do. So much.

00:57.512 --> 00:59.045
But I did it to punish my kids.

00:59.131 --> 01:00.747
They've cracked so many smartphones.

01:00.832 --> 01:03.650
Stop saying
it wasn't your fault! It was!

01:03.735 --> 01:06.603
So I took away the ribbon-cutting
honor and gave it to Oliver.

01:06.655 --> 01:08.605
I'll get my picture
in the "About Town" section

01:08.690 --> 01:10.006
of the Westport Observer.

01:10.042 --> 01:11.541
Anybody who's anybody is in there.

01:11.627 --> 01:12.676
How does this look?

01:14.179 --> 01:17.063
I ate some street food in Manhattan
when I was pregnant with him.

01:17.149 --> 01:20.467
I wonder if one of those meat worms
made its way into his brain.

01:21.753 --> 01:23.086
You're going to that polo match.

01:24.256 --> 01:25.922
<i>If I put on this hat
and go to this thing,</i>

01:25.974 --> 01:28.901
<i>I become everything
I can't stand about this town.</i>

01:28.971 --> 01:30.277
<i>Suddenly, I'm one of those people</i>

01:30.362 --> 01:32.445
<i>who say they're stuffed
after eating salad.</i>

01:32.531 --> 01:33.496
<i>God, I hate...</i>

01:33.565 --> 01:34.798
Hey! What's going on in there?!

01:34.883 --> 01:37.200
I'm not going, and you can't make me.

01:38.186 --> 01:39.603
Hey, Anna-Kat.

01:39.688 --> 01:42.038
You want to lead a horsie out
at a pony event?

01:42.107 --> 01:43.540
Yes!

01:43.592 --> 01:45.125
Got you now.

01:45.210 --> 01:46.209
Wow!

01:46.295 --> 01:47.844
Blindsided by my best friend.

01:47.896 --> 01:50.280
Now I know how Roy felt
when the tiger ate him.

01:50.315 --> 01:53.199

<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

01:56.989 --> 01:59.906
I'll wear this purple tie,
give Oliver the suspenders,

01:59.992 --> 02:01.207
we'll put the girls in purple dresses,

02:01.293 --> 02:03.576
and we'll figure something out
for you so we all match.

02:03.662 --> 02:05.795
Where the hell did you get
a purple bow tie?

02:05.831 --> 02:07.664
When I was alternate number 3
in my Duke a cappella group.

02:07.749 --> 02:09.249
Don't.

02:09.334 --> 02:11.835
You know I can't control my face
when I listen to you sing.

02:17.225 --> 02:19.092
Are you watching that video
of me dancing again?

02:19.177 --> 02:21.144
You gave me two margaritas
and put on Whitney Houston.

02:21.179 --> 02:23.763
- It was basically entrapment.
- No!

02:23.849 --> 02:26.483
I am trying to convince Billy
to come to the polo match.

02:26.518 --> 02:28.518
I don't want
your old college roommate here.

02:28.570 --> 02:30.153
He's like a man mixed with an infant.

02:30.188 --> 02:31.154
He's a "minfant."

02:31.189 --> 02:32.355
Don't judge Billy.

02:32.441 --> 02:34.240
Remember, if he hadn't taken me in

02:34.326 --> 02:36.493
when I got kicked off campus
for a minor infraction...

02:36.528 --> 02:38.244
- You were streaking.
- No.

02:38.330 --> 02:40.664
I was sitting naked in the
fountain, drinking sangria.

02:40.699 --> 02:42.165
"Streaking" implies running.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.917
You're right. I feel silly.

02:44.002 --> 02:45.669
And if Billy hadn't rented me a room,

02:45.704 --> 02:47.704
I might have dropped out, moved home,

02:47.789 --> 02:49.422
never signed up for your class,
never met you,

02:49.508 --> 02:51.041
and our children
would've never been born.

02:51.093 --> 02:53.710
So by you hating Billy,
you hate our children.

02:53.762 --> 02:55.762
Kids! Your dad hates you!

02:55.847 --> 02:57.597
- What?!
- Nothing!

02:57.683 --> 03:00.600
Billy is my connection to who I was.

03:00.686 --> 03:03.019
And if I have to go
to that stupid polo match

03:03.071 --> 03:05.238
and be around those people
that I don't like,

03:05.324 --> 03:06.623
I need him there to lean on.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.458
He's loud, crass,

03:08.510 --> 03:10.627
and need I remind you
what he did at our wedding?

03:10.712 --> 03:12.762
Cake dive!

03:14.066 --> 03:16.066
He ruined our wedding.

03:16.151 --> 03:17.901
Billy's in.

03:17.953 --> 03:19.919
Well, we have no room for him here.

03:20.005 --> 03:22.672
He'll park his food truck in
the driveway and stay in that.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.007
Great.

03:24.059 --> 03:25.842
Why don't we just pull the couch
onto the front lawn

03:25.927 --> 03:28.345
to complete the white-trash tableau.

03:28.430 --> 03:31.191
Just for that, I'm gonna watch
that video of you dancing.

03:33.368 --> 03:35.502
I can't believe Billy's coming to visit.

03:35.587 --> 03:37.754
You should be excited
to see him. He's your godfather.

03:37.806 --> 03:39.689
All he does is terrorize me.

03:39.725 --> 03:42.225
We've been in a seven-year prank war,

03:42.310 --> 03:44.244
and he's the only one doing the pranks.

03:44.329 --> 03:46.079
I will never be happier than the day

03:46.164 --> 03:47.664
I saw you with shaved eyebrows.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.582
He's here!

03:49.668 --> 03:50.967
Out of my way!

03:52.003 --> 03:53.970
How come you're never
that excited to see me?

03:54.022 --> 03:55.688
Too many reasons to name right now!

03:55.774 --> 03:56.656
Come on, Greg!

03:56.742 --> 03:57.824
Billy!

03:57.909 --> 03:59.859
Hey! [Bleep] Breath!

03:59.945 --> 04:00.877
Lovely.

04:02.414 --> 04:03.463
How you doing, chief?

04:03.548 --> 04:04.547
Chief is well. Thank you.

04:04.583 --> 04:05.965
- And it's "Greg."
- Ah. Okay.

04:06.051 --> 04:07.083
He never remembers my name.

04:07.135 --> 04:08.914
So? He calls me [Bleep] Breath.

04:09.036 --> 04:10.703
What are you upset about?

04:11.773 --> 04:14.274
Say hello to your godfather.

04:14.359 --> 04:16.993
Oliver, someday
I'm gonna come to you for a favor.

04:17.028 --> 04:19.745
Gooba, gooba, goo.

04:19.831 --> 04:22.031
Okay, yeah. I think
this joke has run its course.

04:22.084 --> 04:23.716
You remember Taylor and Anna-Kat.

04:23.802 --> 04:25.502
Yeah. Taylor, it's been a long time.

04:25.587 --> 04:27.337
And I know that you like
to keep your hands clean,

04:27.389 --> 04:29.506
so I got you a box of plastic gloves.

04:29.558 --> 04:32.108
Ooh! The lunch lady wears these.

04:32.144 --> 04:34.310
Oh, thank God you're here to save me.

04:34.396 --> 04:36.863
They're trying to turn me
into a fancy-hat person.

04:36.948 --> 04:38.815
Oh, don't worry about that.
Billy's got ya.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.067
The only thing
going on your head is this.

04:44.823 --> 04:46.956
Sir, could you please
turn off your truck?

04:46.992 --> 04:49.492
Could you please go screw yourself?

04:49.578 --> 04:53.129
You are just what I needed.

04:53.165 --> 04:56.332
Sorry, Ron. You're under no
obligation to go screw yourself.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:06.088 --> 05:08.188
In college,
Billy would make us breakfast

05:08.257 --> 05:09.356
every Sunday morning.

05:10.743 --> 05:12.593
How high were we?

05:15.164 --> 05:18.882
We were on the seventh floor,
so... pretty high.

05:18.968 --> 05:20.434
Terrible save.

05:20.519 --> 05:21.769
Now...

05:21.821 --> 05:24.488
...this is my chicken neck scramble.

05:24.573 --> 05:26.507
My hook is,
I barbecue the chicken necks.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.392
You know, most people throw them away.

05:28.477 --> 05:29.760
When was the last time

05:29.845 --> 05:32.062
your truck passed
a health inspection test?

05:32.148 --> 05:34.114
Well, technically, it's
an old blood-donation truck,

05:34.200 --> 05:35.783
so I skate by inspection-free.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.718
Okay, people,
pass your food to the front.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.025
Ah-ah! Gotcha!

05:46.328 --> 05:48.796
He put shaving cream in my backpack!

05:50.599 --> 05:51.515
Mom!

05:51.600 --> 05:53.434
Oliver, grow a pair.

05:57.907 --> 06:00.340
He's been pulling pranks on me
since I was in kindergarten.

06:00.426 --> 06:01.876
Actually, it started
when you were an infant.

06:01.962 --> 06:02.843
It did?

06:02.928 --> 06:05.863
He drew a tiny mustache on you
with a Sharpie.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.814
You looked just like a fat, bald Hitler.

06:09.335 --> 06:11.051
What do you say this time,
we get him back?

06:12.555 --> 06:14.404
Evil Dad.

06:14.490 --> 06:16.957
Now, this is my kind
of father/son bonding.

06:18.577 --> 06:21.128
Bye, Taylor. Bye, Anna-Kat.

06:21.213 --> 06:22.596
Katie!

06:22.648 --> 06:23.764
Hi!

06:23.816 --> 06:24.932
Hi!

06:24.984 --> 06:26.567
Did you get my e-mail?

06:26.619 --> 06:29.336
Which one of the 40
are you talking about?

06:29.371 --> 06:31.205
We finally got the cafeteria

06:31.290 --> 06:33.924
to change Taco Tuesday to Tofu Tuesday!

06:34.009 --> 06:36.276
- Isn't that great?!
- Amazing!

06:36.312 --> 06:38.078
I know!

06:38.114 --> 06:39.446
Buh-bye!

06:39.498 --> 06:40.831
Bye!

06:42.034 --> 06:43.217
What the hell was that?

06:43.285 --> 06:44.885
It was like listening
to two dolphins banging.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.521
Oh, it's terrible. I don't even
notice I do it anymore.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.405
Hey!

06:50.292 --> 06:52.367
Who's this number 4 combo?

06:52.828 --> 06:54.962
One neck, two breasts,
and an ass full of Tabasco.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.264
Oh, that's Tara.
She's the worst of the bunch.

06:57.316 --> 06:59.016
She's Taylor's boyfriend's mom.

06:59.101 --> 07:01.652
Tara, this is my friend Billy.

07:01.737 --> 07:03.403
You see this?

07:03.455 --> 07:05.172
A-minus!

07:05.207 --> 07:08.175
Eyo has never gotten
below an "A" in his life.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.309
It's your daughter's fault.

07:09.361 --> 07:11.028
She's a distraction,
and I won't have it.

07:11.113 --> 07:14.031
This is the kind of
nonsense I deal with every day.

07:14.116 --> 07:16.333
I mean, how do you not
stick your head in a deep fryer?

07:16.418 --> 07:17.584
I don't have a deep fryer.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.636
That is the most honest answer
I could give you.

07:19.722 --> 07:20.938
Listen to me.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.523
Eyo is going to medical school,

07:22.575 --> 07:24.992
and your girl's not going to get in his way.

07:25.044 --> 07:26.960
Stop talking to her!

07:27.046 --> 07:29.930
Remember, you're going
to be an anesthesiologist!

07:30.015 --> 07:31.148
Have you seen enough?

07:31.233 --> 07:32.266
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

07:32.318 --> 07:34.017
Want to go to second breakfast with me?

07:34.103 --> 07:35.519
It'll be my third, but sure.

07:37.923 --> 07:39.373
So, this is your favorite spot
in town, huh?

07:39.425 --> 07:40.924
Yeah. What do you think?

07:43.179 --> 07:45.979
Twel... Twelve dollars? For eggs?

07:46.065 --> 07:48.832
I can get you a neck-and-onion
scramble for $2.99.

07:48.918 --> 07:51.835
Well, everything's pesticide-free, so...

07:51.921 --> 07:52.886
Oh.

07:52.922 --> 07:55.072
Yeah, yeah, it's really...

07:55.157 --> 07:56.990
- clean.
- Mm.

07:57.026 --> 07:59.159
Oh, look at that. There's not
even any gum under the table.

07:59.245 --> 08:00.244
Mnh-mnh.

08:00.329 --> 08:01.378
And there is now.

08:01.463 --> 08:02.679
Billy.

08:02.765 --> 08:05.599
Hey, when did you become so hoity-toity?

08:05.651 --> 08:07.935
Well, my back's
kind of up against the wall.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.254
In Westport, there's not many choices.

08:10.339 --> 08:11.088
Hm.

08:13.676 --> 08:14.841
You want to get out of here

08:14.927 --> 08:16.026
and go have breakfast
the way we used to?

08:16.111 --> 08:17.144
Hell yeah.

08:30.526 --> 08:32.525
Nothing better
than gas-station grub, huh?

08:32.578 --> 08:34.528
Onion rings dipped in nacho cheese

08:34.597 --> 08:35.879
spelled with a "Z"...

08:35.965 --> 08:37.514
nothing makes me happier.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.099
So, what are we gonna do
at this polo match?

08:39.134 --> 08:40.384
Let the horses out and then be like,

08:40.469 --> 08:41.602
"I don't know how they got out"?

08:41.654 --> 08:43.570
We can't do that.

08:43.621 --> 08:44.955
I still gotta live here, Billy.

08:46.508 --> 08:48.508
Can't drink a tall boy right now.

08:48.560 --> 08:49.810
Why not?

08:49.845 --> 08:51.762
Just put them back in the bag.

08:51.847 --> 08:53.030
We'll drink them later.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.531
Oh, are you worried
that someone's gonna see you

08:54.617 --> 08:57.251
getting drunk at a gas station
at 9:30 in the morning?

08:57.336 --> 08:59.303
Yeah. That covers all the bases.

09:02.391 --> 09:03.607
What are you looking at?

09:03.692 --> 09:05.325
You've changed.

09:06.495 --> 09:07.794
You're crazy!

09:07.880 --> 09:09.963
Oh, come on! You're eating
in fancy restaurants,

09:10.049 --> 09:11.632
taking me to a polo match,

09:11.684 --> 09:13.267
letting a tall boy go flat.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.235
Same girl I ever was.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.286
Okay.

09:16.372 --> 09:17.838
I am!

09:20.843 --> 09:21.775
Prove it.

09:21.810 --> 09:22.809
Steal that.

09:24.363 --> 09:25.612
That stupid thing?

09:25.664 --> 09:26.747
You see?

09:26.782 --> 09:28.215
Old Katie wouldn't think twice.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.333
What happened to the girl

09:29.418 --> 09:31.084
who made jello shots out of toilet water

09:31.136 --> 09:32.769
and took out an entire sorority?

09:32.855 --> 09:34.638
Oh, that was the best!

09:34.723 --> 09:35.906
Yeah, where's that girl?

09:44.333 --> 09:45.983
She's right here.

09:56.445 --> 09:58.962
What kind of lesson is this
for the kids?!

10:03.652 --> 10:05.185
Billy dared me.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.571
I do not like these friends of hers.

10:07.656 --> 10:09.956
You're gonna take this back,
and you're going to apologize.

10:09.992 --> 10:11.241
Fine.

10:11.327 --> 10:13.076
But I can't apologize.

10:13.162 --> 10:14.711
I don't even know
what this thing is called.

10:14.797 --> 10:17.297
What am I supposed to say?
"Sorry I stole your..."

10:23.439 --> 10:25.956
I'm practicing leading the pony
onto the field.

10:26.041 --> 10:29.009
But before you say anything,
I realize...

10:29.044 --> 10:31.178
this is make-believe.

10:31.263 --> 10:32.846
You look amazing, baby.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.514
You know...

10:34.600 --> 10:36.066
this could work.

10:40.706 --> 10:42.172
Now...

10:42.257 --> 10:43.957
we all match.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.425
No.

10:45.477 --> 10:46.259
Mnh-mnh.

10:46.345 --> 10:47.594
Come on, Mama.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.613
Please!

10:49.698 --> 10:51.231
Okay.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.950
I've got to learn to love you less.

11:02.144 --> 11:04.478
Don't worry about me, Westport.
Wear whatever you want.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.580
Hey, don't call me Westport.

11:06.615 --> 11:09.199
Pbht! I bet you even
started wearing underwear.

11:09.284 --> 11:10.217
Ew! Mom!

11:11.387 --> 11:12.586
Mine.

11:17.092 --> 11:19.693
Revenge is a dish... best served cold.

11:19.778 --> 11:21.361
And with tartar control.

11:24.416 --> 11:26.249
Look, Katie...

11:26.335 --> 11:27.717
I'll go with ya....

11:29.104 --> 11:30.520
...but I'm not wearing a hat.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.856
And I'm 50/50 on wearing a shirt.

11:36.745 --> 11:37.994
He didn't even notice!

11:38.080 --> 11:41.298
The doughnut was filled
with half a tube of toothpaste.

11:41.383 --> 11:42.416
A goat would've spit it out.

11:44.253 --> 11:45.669
So, what do we try next?

11:45.754 --> 11:46.753
That's all I got.

11:46.805 --> 11:49.256
Dad. Think about it.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.224
What did people do to you
when you were a kid?

11:51.310 --> 11:52.559
You're not gonna believe this,

11:52.644 --> 11:54.945
but I was actually pretty cool
when I was a kid.

11:55.030 --> 11:57.948
Just so I have a point of reference,
are you cool now?

11:58.033 --> 12:00.684
I started listening to Ryan Seacrest
on the way to work.

12:00.869 --> 12:02.202
Okay.

12:02.287 --> 12:04.254
That gives me
all the information I need.

12:07.009 --> 12:09.392
I'm gonna wear these Kelly-green
pants to the polo match.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.011
I'm just gonna do it!

12:11.096 --> 12:12.896
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm gonna look like an idiot.

12:12.981 --> 12:15.315
Let me know how it goes,
because I'm staying home.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.318
Why?

12:18.370 --> 12:20.821
I'm just not up for pretending
to be one of those people.

12:20.906 --> 12:21.905
It's not me.

12:21.990 --> 12:24.324
And if I go, it's like I'm giving in.

12:24.376 --> 12:25.742
But it's Doris' charity.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.328
She still isn't even sure
what the charity is for...

12:28.413 --> 12:29.913
or what charity is.

12:29.998 --> 12:31.081
The whole family is going.

12:31.166 --> 12:33.133
You're part of the family,
so you're going.

12:33.168 --> 12:34.167
Fine.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.840
What is with you?

12:41.176 --> 12:42.559
Have I changed?

12:42.644 --> 12:44.561
What are you talking about?

12:44.646 --> 12:46.763
Am I a different person
than who I used to be?

12:46.849 --> 12:49.349
Of course. You've grown up.
You got kids and a house.

12:49.434 --> 12:53.270
No. I mean have I changed
since we moved to Westport?

12:53.355 --> 12:54.821
You really need to stop worrying

12:54.857 --> 12:57.574
what a guy who lives inside
a chicken truck thinks of you.

12:57.659 --> 13:00.911
You've changed
in appropriate and healthy ways.

13:00.996 --> 13:02.863
Come on. Let's get ready for bed.

13:06.168 --> 13:08.118
<i>I'm appropriate? And healthy?</i>

13:08.203 --> 13:09.703
<i>Just add the word "polite,"</i>

13:09.755 --> 13:11.872
<i>and I become everything I can't stand.</i>

13:11.957 --> 13:14.007
<i>I am not letting go of the old Katie.</i>

13:14.042 --> 13:16.710
<i>And the first thing is,
I'm done talking in my head.</i>

13:16.762 --> 13:18.295
I am not changing!

13:18.380 --> 13:20.297
Hey, you want to sleep in your
clothes, knock yourself out.

13:25.612 --> 13:27.162
I'm gonna take Anna-Kat and sign in.

13:27.247 --> 13:28.580
Okay, Champ. Catch you later.

13:28.632 --> 13:30.182
- You know my name is Greg.
- You got it, Ace.

13:30.217 --> 13:31.383
Rum and coke?

13:31.468 --> 13:33.218
- Tequila.
- There she is!

13:33.270 --> 13:34.319
Yeaaaaah!

13:36.323 --> 13:38.457
Hey, Mrs. Otto. I like your hat.

13:38.542 --> 13:39.624
Eyo.

13:39.710 --> 13:41.510
I... don't like your hat?

13:41.595 --> 13:42.844
Eyo!

13:42.930 --> 13:45.147
Mrs. Otto, I recognize
the existence of your hat,

13:45.232 --> 13:46.865
but I have... no opinion on it.

13:46.950 --> 13:48.533
Thank you, Eyo.

13:51.555 --> 13:53.472
- I made you be fancy!
- Yeah.

13:53.524 --> 13:54.940
I'm returning this dress tomorrow,

13:54.975 --> 13:56.441
as long as I don't pit out too badly.

13:57.594 --> 13:59.745
Oliver, here are
the ceremonial scissors.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.763
I know we have our differences

14:01.849 --> 14:04.099
and you're only doing this
to punish your kids...

14:05.219 --> 14:06.601
...but thanks.

14:06.670 --> 14:07.986
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:08.072 --> 14:10.789
I'm off to find some people who matter.

14:10.874 --> 14:11.957
I should do that, too.

14:12.042 --> 14:13.175
No offense, Katie.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.843
Sure.

14:14.928 --> 14:17.612
- Hi, Katie!
- Hi, Suzanne!

14:17.698 --> 14:19.531
You look amazing!

14:19.616 --> 14:22.217
- Uh-huh. But...?
- But nothing.

14:22.302 --> 14:24.302
I would kill to have that skin.

14:24.354 --> 14:25.904
Oh. It's because I don't run.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.574
You're hysterical.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.410
I'm gonna come back
and grab you in a few.

14:31.462 --> 14:32.928
We're taking a group picture.

14:33.013 --> 14:35.013
Mm. You want me to take it for you?

14:35.099 --> 14:38.066
No, we want you in it... with us!

14:38.152 --> 14:39.317
Oh!

14:39.369 --> 14:41.286
- Sure.
- Yeah.

14:41.371 --> 14:43.205
We'll all hang out
and drink Tom Collinses.

14:43.290 --> 14:44.256
They're back.

14:44.341 --> 14:45.590
I didn't know they were gone.

14:45.642 --> 14:46.558
But I'm in.

14:46.610 --> 14:47.859
Oh!

14:47.895 --> 14:49.444
Oh.

14:49.530 --> 14:51.830
Look who got invited to sit
with the cool girls at school.

14:51.865 --> 14:53.632
I can't stop them from being nice to me.

14:53.667 --> 14:54.883
Yeah.

14:54.968 --> 14:57.302
Doris, this is my old friend Billy.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.604
I'm so glad you came.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.808
He's not wearing a jacket,
a tie, or closed-toe shoes.

15:02.876 --> 15:04.209
This is a closed-toe event.

15:04.294 --> 15:07.136
Hey, you ever, um... thought of adding
a betting element to this thing?

15:07.238 --> 15:10.246
I mean, you got all the ingredients...
horses, booze...

15:10.350 --> 15:11.533
idiots with money.

15:11.618 --> 15:13.952
Billy, this is Doris' event.

15:14.037 --> 15:15.454
- Be nice.
- Oh. Okay.

15:15.539 --> 15:18.723
For your information,
this is the premier event for...

15:19.726 --> 15:21.359
...the charity it supports.

15:21.411 --> 15:23.028
You still don't know what it's called.

15:23.113 --> 15:24.720
Yes, I do.

15:25.499 --> 15:27.265
Big Hands, Small Hearts.

15:27.301 --> 15:30.152
So it's gonna help people
born with big hands

15:30.237 --> 15:32.037
and/or small hearts.

15:32.072 --> 15:33.196
Hm.

15:33.874 --> 15:35.574
Angela, this is my friend Billy.

15:35.659 --> 15:36.825
- Hi!
- Oh.

15:36.910 --> 15:37.826
- Oh!
- Mwah!

15:37.895 --> 15:39.478
I've heard so much about you.

15:39.513 --> 15:40.812
I could turn her if I wanted to.

15:42.349 --> 15:43.482
No way in hell.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.484
Oh. I'm just not in the mood.

15:45.536 --> 15:46.618
Okay.

15:46.703 --> 15:48.804
Doris, there isn't
a suitable vegan option.

15:48.889 --> 15:50.055
Oh, sure there is.

15:50.090 --> 15:52.524
The vegan option is to go home and eat.

15:52.559 --> 15:54.609
Oh! Okay. Come on.

15:54.695 --> 15:56.311
For an event
that sponsors heart disease,

15:56.380 --> 15:58.580
you sure have a lot of bacon
on that buffet!

15:58.665 --> 16:00.582
- Heart disease? So that's it.
- Yeah.

16:00.667 --> 16:02.150
- Where do the huge hands come in?
- I don't know.

16:04.188 --> 16:05.537
- Tara.
- Hm?

16:05.572 --> 16:07.239
Looks like you and I will be spending

16:07.324 --> 16:09.624
a lot more Christmases together.

16:09.710 --> 16:12.928
Do not kiss her!
I saw her eating cheese!

16:13.564 --> 16:15.263
Hi!

16:15.332 --> 16:16.815
Can we steal Katie for a sec?

16:16.867 --> 16:17.782
No.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.000
Byeeee!

16:19.803 --> 16:21.086
I can't tell if you're mad or confused

16:21.171 --> 16:22.554
'cause of your frozen forehead.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.142
Suzanne, he's just a big goof.

16:27.227 --> 16:28.193
I'll catch you later.

16:30.497 --> 16:32.664
I saved you from that one.
You owe me big.

16:32.749 --> 16:34.382
Mm.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.650
So big.

16:36.937 --> 16:38.870
Say "Tom Collins"!

16:42.376 --> 16:43.792
Thank you, everyone,

16:43.877 --> 16:47.646
for attending and contributing
to this... important event.

16:47.681 --> 16:50.282
A-And now Oliver Otto
will cut the ceremonial ribbon.

16:51.485 --> 16:53.585
Just to be clear, he is not my child.

16:55.956 --> 16:57.556
Oliver, where are the giant scissors?

16:57.591 --> 16:59.808
They were just here a second ago.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.977
They're enormous. How did you lose them?

17:02.062 --> 17:03.061
We'll find them.

17:03.113 --> 17:04.563
Doris, distract the crowd.

17:05.949 --> 17:08.583
Uh, s-so, where's everybody from?

17:08.669 --> 17:10.417
Is that Cartier or Tiffany?

17:11.722 --> 17:12.971
Do you like your mint julep?

17:13.006 --> 17:14.506
I think your friend's
high-pitched giggle

17:14.558 --> 17:15.640
tells us all we need to know.

17:15.726 --> 17:16.775
Oh, God.

17:19.479 --> 17:21.279
What did you do?

17:21.330 --> 17:23.714
What you brought me here
to do... mess with people.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.650
Billy, why did you take the scissors?

17:26.686 --> 17:28.603
Oh! Okay. I found them!

17:28.689 --> 17:31.523
Tara! You tried to sabotage my event

17:31.558 --> 17:33.441
because I didn't have a vegan option?

17:33.527 --> 17:35.493
I didn't take your stupid scissors!

17:35.545 --> 17:37.245
Then how the hell
did they get in your purse?

17:37.331 --> 17:39.497
- I don't know! Ask her!
- Billy, tell them what you did.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.433
Oh, come on! Don't be like that.

17:41.468 --> 17:42.801
You're ruining my friend's event.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.302
Katie, that's an overreaction.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.770
I mean, you know,
people can still get in here.

17:45.806 --> 17:47.072
The ribbon's only held up by tape.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.907
That is not the point.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.992
They have traditions here.

17:51.078 --> 17:52.544
I want you to leave.

17:52.596 --> 17:54.713
You are violating my personal space.

17:54.765 --> 17:56.348
I need a 2-foot circle.

17:56.433 --> 17:57.432
2-foot circle!

17:57.517 --> 17:59.017
Oh, you got it now.

17:59.069 --> 18:00.185
Oh, this is getting good.

18:01.154 --> 18:02.487
Slap her!

18:02.572 --> 18:03.655
That wasn't me!

18:03.707 --> 18:04.823
That's it, Tara.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.959
- Angela, hold my diamond.
- Oh, I will squash you!

18:08.045 --> 18:10.095
I have taken many self-defense classes!

18:10.180 --> 18:11.596
<i>Billy's right.</i>

18:11.682 --> 18:14.566
<i>I brought him here
to do just this... mix it up.</i>

18:14.601 --> 18:16.484
<i>But I did want to be in that picture</i>

18:16.570 --> 18:18.203
<i>with Suzanne and the other moms.</i>

18:18.255 --> 18:19.170
<i>Huh.</i>

18:19.206 --> 18:20.422
<i>Is it possible that I've...</i>

18:21.675 --> 18:22.974
Okay, hold on!

18:23.010 --> 18:24.092
Hold on!

18:24.177 --> 18:26.311
Tara didn't steal the scissors!

18:26.346 --> 18:27.228
Yeah.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.114
My stupid friend Billy did.

18:31.285 --> 18:32.667
Apologize.

18:32.753 --> 18:34.369
What are you doing?

18:34.454 --> 18:35.787
W-Why are you taking their side?

18:35.872 --> 18:38.590
I mean... you're the one
who's always bagging on them.

18:38.642 --> 18:40.892
Because I'm allowed to.

18:40.944 --> 18:44.029
Because these are my friends.

18:44.097 --> 18:46.164
And they're growing on me.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.334
And I'm stuck living near this.

18:49.369 --> 18:50.502
I knew it.

18:50.537 --> 18:51.836
You have changed.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.338
You've become one of them.

18:53.390 --> 18:55.223
Yeah.

18:55.309 --> 18:56.591
I guess I have.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.727
This is my community.

18:58.812 --> 19:02.564
And if I'm going to live here,
I want to be a part of it.

19:02.649 --> 19:04.316
So yeah.

19:04.401 --> 19:06.651
These are my people.

19:06.737 --> 19:07.869
...ish.

19:09.239 --> 19:10.672
Sorry, Champ.

19:10.757 --> 19:12.557
Oliver, cut the ribbon.

19:16.963 --> 19:18.867
Where'd the scissors go now?

19:19.182 --> 19:21.099
Run!

19:25.439 --> 19:26.938
You got to respect that.

19:29.276 --> 19:30.108
Taylor...

19:30.193 --> 19:32.660
I really like the boyfriend.

19:32.746 --> 19:33.962
Sweetheart...

19:34.047 --> 19:36.214
that was some of the best
pony-leading I've ever seen.

19:36.299 --> 19:38.883
Even though I let it go and it
ran through the parking lot?

19:38.969 --> 19:41.136
Because you let it go and it
ran through the parking lot.

19:42.272 --> 19:44.356
Oliver, because I'm in a generous mood,

19:44.391 --> 19:47.058
you did get me
with the toothpaste doughnut.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.110
I threw up in the bathroom
and had diarrhea for two days.

19:50.364 --> 19:51.813
Well done.

19:51.898 --> 19:55.116
I'm sorry that I'm not
the Katie you were expecting.

19:55.202 --> 19:56.401
Gah.

19:56.453 --> 19:57.786
It'll take some getting used to,

19:57.871 --> 20:00.705
like when David Lee Roth left
and Sammy Hagar replaced him.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.124
The band was the same... but different.

20:04.044 --> 20:06.461
And, then again, maybe
this is not like that at all.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.574
- Bye, Rick.
- It's Greg!

20:21.568 --> 20:24.119
Congratulations
on winning the prank war.

20:24.204 --> 20:25.954
Couldn't have done it without you.

20:26.040 --> 20:29.124
I'm glad we brought some dignity
back to the Otto name.

20:29.209 --> 20:30.242
Good job, son.

20:30.327 --> 20:31.326
Good job, Dad.

20:33.380 --> 20:34.746
Aaah!

20:34.798 --> 20:36.782
Come on! Dad!

20:38.752 --> 20:39.668
I'll get the giant scissors.

20:39.753 --> 20:40.802
Hurry.

20:40.826 --> 20:43.826
