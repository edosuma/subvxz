WEBVTT

00:23.815 --> 00:26.401
Okay, sorry. Hello, family.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.194
<i> Let's find the surprise.</i>

00:28.278 --> 00:30.113
<i>Where's the surprise?</i>

00:30.196 --> 00:31.740
<i>Here's the surprise!</i>

00:31.823 --> 00:33.033
<i>-Surprise!</i>
<i>-Granny!</i>

00:33.116 --> 00:34.826
-Oh, my gosh.

00:34.909 --> 00:37.912
-Oh, Grandma, I miss you.
<i>Hello, lovey.</i>

00:39.414 --> 00:41.374
<i>Bertie, blow out the candles.</i>

00:41.458 --> 00:44.502
Oh, well, now, you know I can't,
'cause I'm not there.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.296
-I hope you don't want me to--
<i>-Blow on the screen!</i>

00:46.379 --> 00:48.965
Well, okay.

00:52.469 --> 00:57.140
<i>Bertie, what are you going to do</i>
<i>to celebrate without us?</i>

00:57.223 --> 00:58.516
Oh, um...

00:59.059 --> 01:00.518
I don't really know.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.855
Um... But I think Mickey's got
something planned.

01:03.938 --> 01:08.526
I'll probably just spend some time
with all of my friends here in LA.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.528
There's always something great to do here.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.238
So, it's gonna be good.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.324
<i>I'm so jealous. I wanna come visit.</i>

01:14.407 --> 01:16.701
<i>But Mom says if I go,</i>
<i>she has to come, too.</i>

01:16.785 --> 01:17.911
<i>-It's not fair.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

01:17.994 --> 01:19.746
<i>Oh, well, what's wrong with that?</i>

01:19.829 --> 01:25.084
<i>A mom and her two daughters</i>
<i>doing lovely things in LA together.</i>

01:25.168 --> 01:28.129
<i></i>
-That would be really cool.

01:28.213 --> 01:31.966
Um, anyway, guys,
it's been so nice chatting to you,

01:32.050 --> 01:34.427
and I'm happy to see you,
and I love you so much,

01:34.511 --> 01:38.306
but I do really wanna get a little bit
more rest before my big day of fun.

01:38.389 --> 01:41.100
So I'm gonna have to say
goodbye for now, okay?

01:41.184 --> 01:44.771
<i>-Bye, Bertie, I miss you. I love you!</i>
<i>-Your Uncle Basil died!</i>

01:44.854 --> 01:45.855
Bye.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.090
Hey.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.008
How'd you sleep?

02:15.093 --> 02:16.219
How did I sleep?

02:17.011 --> 02:20.348
That's a little creepy.
Seems like a kinda personal question.

02:20.431 --> 02:23.393
I was just trying to have
some normal breakfast conversation.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.563
-We're out of toilet paper.
-Then buy some.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.815
Ladies should choose
the toilet paper they want

02:28.898 --> 02:31.359
because you have to use it
in two different areas.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.611
Just tell me what you want,
and I can get it for ya.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.406
Good morning, everyone.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.784
-Guess whose birthday it is today.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.913
-No. No, close.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.665
It's me, Bertie Beverly Bauer.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.542
"Sweet as honey
'cause she's got three Bs."

02:47.625 --> 02:50.920
-That's what Daddy used to say.
-Bertie, happy birthday!

02:51.004 --> 02:53.631
Holy shit. Happy birthday!
I feel bad I didn't know.

02:53.715 --> 02:57.677
-I'm usually on top of that kind of thing.
Hmm.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.762
I'm sorry. Why didn't you fucking tell me?

02:59.846 --> 03:01.222
I would have gotten you a stripper

03:01.306 --> 03:03.933
to come serve you breakfast in bed
or something.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.061
Oh, didn't I mention it?
I guess, my mistake.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.523
It's my first birthday in America.
Yankee doodle birthday!

03:10.607 --> 03:13.067
I was hoping you guys
would join me celebrating tonight.

03:13.651 --> 03:17.947
Oh, shit. Bertie, I wish I could,
but I can't tonight. I got...

03:18.531 --> 03:21.743
This is kind of embarrassing.
I have a colonoscopy tomorrow.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.120
Dr. Schnittman fit me in
at the last minute.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.414
It's really hard to get an appointment.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.498
He's the best in the West.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.876
I have to chug
this gross, gray drink all night

03:29.959 --> 03:31.461
to clear me out for the procedure.

03:31.544 --> 03:35.173
You turn into a faucet,
and things pour out of you, basically.

03:35.256 --> 03:36.299
I have to be close to a toilet.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.927
Schnittman says don't go
more than ten feet from a toilet,

03:39.010 --> 03:41.387
or there's gonna be some sort of disaster.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.682
And you're gonna be shitting all
of that out at our place?

03:44.766 --> 03:47.310
Yeah, in the bathroom.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.313
So you're definitely buying us
some fucking toilet paper.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.690
Yeah, I'll get you toilet paper.

03:53.316 --> 03:57.028
Oh, before I forget, can you drive me
to my colonoscopy tomorrow?

03:57.111 --> 03:59.364
Absolutely. That's fine by me.

03:59.447 --> 04:02.283
Bertie, I'm so sorry. I can't, either.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.119
We're interviewing this sex worker.
Tonight's the only night she can do it.

04:05.203 --> 04:09.123
No. No worries, really. It's my fault
for not alerting you earlier.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.917
Um, well, that's fine.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.671
I'm gonna go start my year off right
by going to Bar Body,

04:14.754 --> 04:18.967
where I'll be toning my thighs
and mayhaps my buttocks. So...

04:20.677 --> 04:21.970
-My bag.
-Oh.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.054
Yeah. Bye.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.806
Happy birthday, Bertie!

04:24.889 --> 04:27.558
Press your lower back down,
hold on behind your thighs,

04:27.642 --> 04:30.019
extend your legs up to a diagonal.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.231
Keep going. Exhale. Exhale.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.733
Okay, no hands touching. Thank you.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.485
-A little up. A little down.
-Oh, okay.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.362
-Yes, out. And in.
-Great.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.197
-Two more times. Up.
-I got it, I think.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.657
-Down. Okay, out...
-Thank you.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.534
-Lift up.
-No.

04:44.617 --> 04:48.329
Switch. Curl. Switch. Curl.

04:48.413 --> 04:52.792
Soften your knees more.
Draw your shoulders back. Tuck. Tuck.

04:52.875 --> 04:56.838
Keep going. Just 50 more. Curl.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.257
-Pull your abdominals in. Lift--
-That's okay.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.301
You don't need to help me. Thank you.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.594
This guy seemed nice.

05:03.678 --> 05:07.098
He was tall and not bald,
which never happens on Tinder.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.016
Uh-huh.

05:08.099 --> 05:13.396
I always match with these short, fat guys
who have no money.

05:13.479 --> 05:16.858
But this guy, he was handsome.
He was smart.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.527
-We go to this new Italian place.
-Uh-huh.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.780
-Oh, girl, hello. It was really good.
Yeah.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.533
-Mmm.

05:25.616 --> 05:30.872
-But, well, to make a long story short--
-Too late. Kidding. Kidding.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.123
-Good morning.
So--

05:32.206 --> 05:33.666
Clayton!

05:33.750 --> 05:35.043
-Hey!

05:35.126 --> 05:37.128
Bye, Sandra. So great to chat.

05:39.213 --> 05:42.842
-I'm really good. It's so nice to see you.
-Yeah, you too.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.343
-Hey.
-Hi, take it easy.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.678
-Bye, Sandra!
I have a bit of news.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.473
-It's my birthday.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.266
What? Happy birthday, Bertie!

05:50.349 --> 05:53.853
I went for a big, crazy weekend
with all my besties last weekend.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.688
We went on a big pub crawl.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.566
But it seems kind of weird
to not do anything tonight.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.777
It's your birthday.
You gotta do something.

06:00.860 --> 06:05.406
I was wondering if you would like to go
for a drink after work or something?

06:05.490 --> 06:08.242
Oh, man, like, I would love to,

06:08.326 --> 06:12.830
but my girlfriend is real strict about me
not having any female friends.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.540
Right. Tight leash. I get it.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.460
Yeah. She says it'll lead
to emotional affairs

06:17.543 --> 06:21.255
and then, ultimately, that leads
to fucking. She's not wrong.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.801
I don't have any platonic friends.
I'm an extremely sexual person.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.386
If it's in front of me,
I'm probably gonna fuck it.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.681
Not what I was doing here.
But it's a no. That's cool. I get it.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.768
But you have a good time.
Enjoy your birthday, B.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.311
Thank you so much. I will.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.313
-All right.
-It's gonna be fun. Whoo!

06:43.444 --> 06:45.822
If anybody's wondering,
I do have crab legs,

06:45.905 --> 06:49.200
which is probably why it's so hard
to keep my pants on.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.701
Just having fun.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.079
I'll be back to check on you.
All right? Great.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.583
-Hey. -Hey.
-Hey.

06:59.293 --> 07:03.339
Did you hear?
He went with the crab legs joke again.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.174
God. He's like a walking dad joke.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.969
If I'm working here when I'm 30,
light me on fire.

07:08.052 --> 07:11.472
And what the hell is he smiling about?
His life is so sad.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.557
I know.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.351
Do you remember
when he brought his parents here?

07:15.435 --> 07:18.020
He was so happy.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.870
Pinot noir.
-All right.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.917
And welcome to the Smoke House.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.461
-Oh, you're here.
-Hey!

07:41.544 --> 07:43.754
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting you.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.925
You coming over tonight?
I can steal tiramisu from the kitchen.

07:48.009 --> 07:51.220
-There's, like, tons.
-Uh, hey, babe, just a heads-up.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.682
Tom is about to stop by.
He wanted to have lunch here.

07:54.765 --> 07:57.477
What
You told me you guys were separated.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.479
You said he doesn't respect
your spirituality.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.939
We're separated.
We will be separated. Whatever.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.774
I tried to get him to go somewhere else,

08:03.858 --> 08:05.651
but he loves
the fucking onion blossom here.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.320
Who doesn't? It's our signature dish.

08:07.403 --> 08:10.490
-This is gonna be awkward as--
-Hi. I'm so sorry.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.617
I got so caught up. I apologize.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.952
Could I get a bourbon, neat, please?

08:15.036 --> 08:17.330
Oh, you'd actually go
through the bartender for drinks.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.664
-Oh, sorry.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.542
-Uh, can we start with a--

08:21.626 --> 08:23.252
I'm a psychic, so...

08:23.836 --> 08:24.795
I'm playing with ya.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.839
-She told me that's what you want.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

08:28.049 --> 08:28.925
I'll put that in for you.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.593
-Thanks.
-Okay.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.552
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.346
Sorry I'm late. How's it going?

08:33.429 --> 08:34.597
-Good.
-Good.

08:34.680 --> 08:38.184
So, bad news.
They don't have the moon roof...

08:38.267 --> 08:39.143
Oh, God.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.555
Enjoy.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.727
Hey! Bertie, you showed up.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.062
-Hi!
-That's so cool.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.648
Well, I love cake, and I love free things.

09:25.731 --> 09:29.026
And come to think of it,
free is my favorite flavor.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.531
Yeah.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.117
Uh... You know what?
Let's get you a table.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.245
-Follow me. We'll talk to the hostess.
-Great.

09:39.328 --> 09:42.373
<i> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

09:42.456 --> 09:47.253
<i>♪ Happy birthday</i>
<i>Smoke House's favorite customer ♪</i>

09:47.336 --> 09:51.340
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

09:55.094 --> 09:58.180
You want me to sing
"Happy Birthday" backwards?

09:58.264 --> 10:00.349
-Um, okay.

10:01.183 --> 10:06.856
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday to... ♪</i>

10:08.691 --> 10:09.900
I'm just being dumb.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.194
Well, I love it here.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.779
It seems like the kind of place

10:13.863 --> 10:16.657
where someone would get gunned down
by the mob,

10:16.741 --> 10:19.035
and wind up face down
in a plate of lamb chops.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.536
-It's really cool.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.955
Yeah. It's a celeb hangout, too.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.834
We're actually sitting
in the George Clooney booth right now.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.169
-Yeah.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.629
Well, as legend has it,

10:29.712 --> 10:32.882
this is where he was sitting when he
got the call that he had booked <i>ER.</i>

10:32.965 --> 10:33.799
Wow.

10:33.883 --> 10:38.346
Yeah, I mean, if these walls could talk,
like, they would be like, you know, "Lots of stuff has happened here!
All the big-time guys hang out here."

10:42.975 --> 10:47.647
I have to admit I had, like, this fantasy
that for my first birthday in America,

10:47.730 --> 10:53.194
I would have a big party,
and there would be a celebrity there.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.112
Not like a Kardashian,

10:55.196 --> 10:59.367
but maybe someone
from <i>The Bachelor</i> or a <i>CSI</i> show,

10:59.450 --> 11:02.828
and I could get a selfie with them
and send it to my family back home.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.082
Apparently, when they were
filming <i>Batman Returns,</i>

11:06.165 --> 11:09.210
um, Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer
and Danny DeVito

11:09.293 --> 11:11.253
would often have dinner here.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.298
Apparently, Danny DeVito
never broke character.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.467
He was always the penguin.
He would order as the Penguin.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.219
-Yeah.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.264
What else do you got planned
for your birthday?

11:22.973 --> 11:24.767
Oh, um...

11:24.850 --> 11:27.603
It's gonna be fun, I think. It will be...

11:27.686 --> 11:30.314
I'll probably meet up
with some other people,

11:30.398 --> 11:32.024
and we'll go and have, uh...

11:32.108 --> 11:35.736
go in a limo,
go for a pub crawl or something.

11:36.404 --> 11:41.075
Or maybe none of those things,
'cause I don't have any more plans.

11:41.158 --> 11:44.328
Bertie, it's your birthday!
-Yeah.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.956
You gotta do something fun
on your birthday.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.166
I'm doing something fun tonight.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.501
-Yeah.

11:50.584 --> 11:53.379
I would love to have company
if you want to come with me.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.713
Aw...

11:54.797 --> 11:58.384
-Yeah, okay. I think that would be great.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.468
What's up, Mike?

12:02.054 --> 12:04.723
He did that on purpose.
We have a whole thing.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.309
He's the weird one.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.187
Friggin' Mike.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.233
This isn't part of the adventure.
I gotta get gas.

12:14.316 --> 12:15.401
Got it.
-Okay.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.406
All right.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.244
I'll be right back.
Do you need anything from in there?

12:25.327 --> 12:27.913
Uh, chewing tobacco! Lots of it.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.540
-Just kidding.
-All right.

12:29.623 --> 12:33.002
Is this weird?
I like to pay inside.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.255
I just try and find human interaction
wherever I can in LA.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.299
That's a cool idea.
I'm gonna do that next time.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.926
Right

12:41.010 --> 12:43.429
Sorry, the "bitch" isn't directed at you.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.015
Oh, no, I get it.
The universe is your bitch.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.517
Exactly. Okay, I'll be right back.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.602
-Bye.
-Okay.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.466
It's pumping.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.602
-It clicks once it's done.
-Okay.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.194
-Thank you.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.155
-Chris!

13:43.739 --> 13:45.658
Yeah. You gotta wait for it.

13:46.408 --> 13:49.119
Oh, my gosh!

13:49.203 --> 13:52.414
This is probably one
of my favorite things,

13:52.498 --> 13:53.499
probably of all time.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.751
Is this where you come to dance
when you're sad, like Kevin Bacon in <i>Footloose?</i>

13:58.087 --> 13:59.713
No!

14:00.965 --> 14:02.841
Oh, wow!

14:02.925 --> 14:04.510
What is this?

14:04.593 --> 14:08.222
W818, the best of Van Nuys wrestling!

14:08.305 --> 14:11.141
Oh, my God. This is crazy!

14:11.225 --> 14:16.021
I love how in LA the best stuff is always
in the most unexpected places.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.483
Like, there'll be really good sushi
in a weird strip mall.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.778
That's the only example
I can think of, actually. You're the first person I've brought here.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.365
-Yeah.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.575
Well, I'm honored.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.119
Suck it, Chris' other friends.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.954
Right?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.539
-It's scary.
Hey, my man!

14:33.622 --> 14:35.040
-You made it!

14:35.124 --> 14:37.251
Hey, what's going on? Hey!

14:37.334 --> 14:38.919
Oh, have you guys ever met Bertie?

14:39.003 --> 14:40.796
This is Frank and Allan
from the Springwood.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.424
-Hi.
-They introduced me to this place.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.009
Kind of like Springwood royalty.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.344
-Oh, well, very nice to meet you.
-Stop.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.638
-This place is amazing.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.223
Sit down. We got seats for you.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.641
-Let's go.
Thank you.

14:52.725 --> 14:56.020
They got wrestling here.
They shoot porno down the block.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.646
Very versatile neighborhood.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.024
And surprisingly good schools.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.819
Chris, is tonight the night you're gonna
go up and show us what you got?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.154
-Nah...
-Nah.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.781
Every month he comes
and chickens out on the action.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.038
Who is that guy? He seems really good.

15:14.121 --> 15:18.417
Oh, yeah. That is Colin Follenweider.
I worship him.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.294
Who is that?

15:20.377 --> 15:23.505
Okay. She is awesome.
She calls herself Mayday Marge.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.383
Oh, she should be called Marge in Charge.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.468
Oh, yeah, right?

15:27.551 --> 15:29.803
Or Sarge Marge 'cause of her outfit.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.597
Holy shit! You should tell her!

15:31.680 --> 15:33.557
-Okay, I will.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.352
Actually, she looks a bit scary,
so I don't want to.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.757
Kill her! Kill her! Fucking kill her!

16:06.840 --> 16:08.258
Kill her!

16:09.551 --> 16:11.845
Holy shit, Bertie.
You've been screaming all night.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.560
You got a real fire inside you.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.314
Oh, my God.
Colin Follenweider is walking towards me.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.858
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Listen to you.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.152
Two hours ago, you had no idea who he was.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.821
-Two hours ago, I was an idiot.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.531
Hi, Bertie. I heard a rumor

16:30.614 --> 16:33.742
that you need a picture taken
for a very special occasion.

16:33.826 --> 16:34.994
It's not a rumor. I told him.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.663
-He told me.
-Mr. Follenweider, I would love that.

16:37.746 --> 16:38.747
Can you take it on my phone?

16:38.831 --> 16:40.082
Let's get the ring in the background.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.500
Good idea.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.085
-You can call me Colin.
-Okay, Colin.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.467
-Epic! One, two, three.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.928
-Got it.
-I gotta get back to the ring.

16:53.012 --> 16:57.558
-I hope you have a great birthday, Bertie.
-Thank you so much. Break a leg.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.435
Someone else's.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.020
Thanks, CF.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.230
-That was incredible.

17:03.313 --> 17:06.150
Oh, my God. I'm texting that
to my mom right now.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.901
-I'll get us beers.
-Thanks.

17:07.985 --> 17:08.986
Yeah.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.573
Hey, what's up, Rex?

17:14.199 --> 17:15.200
Excuse us. Thank you.

17:18.746 --> 17:19.747
He's Scottish.

17:20.622 --> 17:21.832
-I love it.
-Yeah.

17:23.792 --> 17:28.005
But, man, Australia, huh?
What even gave you the balls to move here?

17:28.088 --> 17:29.298
Ah.

17:29.381 --> 17:33.427
Okay. <i>Why I Left Australia</i>
by Bertie Bauer.

17:35.012 --> 17:39.933
I had this boyfriend. And we had known
each other since we were in year seven.

17:40.017 --> 17:45.314
And I worked at this flower shop Petals.
Very chic flower shop.

17:45.397 --> 17:50.027
I drowned thousands of maidenhair ferns
while I worked there.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.238
But, you know,
I was there for eight years.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.239
Wow.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.201
And one day, I just flipped out,

17:57.284 --> 18:01.413
and I decided I wanted
to move over here and start over.

18:01.497 --> 18:06.251
So I told my boyfriend
that I'd gotten a job over here,

18:06.335 --> 18:09.129
which, as you probably guessed, was a lie.

18:09.797 --> 18:14.885
And, yeah, I just wanted to get away
from him and from my apartment

18:14.968 --> 18:16.470
and my old life.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.263
Sorry.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.433
No! Good for you.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.478
I mean, you're here now, right?
That's the cool part.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.272
That flower store sounded cool, too.

18:27.356 --> 18:31.944
Yeah, but now I've just settled
for another kind of comfortable situation.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.405
Oh, I remember you said you...

18:36.073 --> 18:39.451
have a habit of doing that
at Mickey's work thing.

18:39.535 --> 18:43.622
But, I mean, Randy seems
like a good guy, right?

18:43.705 --> 18:46.458
-Oh, yeah. I didn't mean...
-Yeah.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.378
-I wasn't necessarily talking about that.
-Oh, yeah.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.755
I just mean, I wanna try new things

18:51.839 --> 18:57.636
and have more exciting nights like this
and jump off the top turnbuckle of life.

18:57.719 --> 19:01.473
Dude, me too! Like, oh, God...

19:02.015 --> 19:03.559
Look at me. I'm such a wimp.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.436
I've been coming here for months
and haven't wrestled once.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.772
Well, why not? You should try it.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.400
Excuse me. Hi.

19:11.483 --> 19:15.737
Hi. Does anyone here by any chance
need someone to wrestle with tonight?

19:22.953 --> 19:23.829
Whoa!

19:23.912 --> 19:25.372
It's Cremator time!

19:37.968 --> 19:42.347
Hey, Keith! You suck! Big time!

19:42.931 --> 19:44.057
What'd you say?

19:44.141 --> 19:46.810
Oh, you didn't hear?
Maybe you need a hearing aid!

19:46.894 --> 19:50.772
I said, Keith the Cremator sucks!

19:50.856 --> 19:53.525
My little niece Julia
hits harder than that,

19:53.609 --> 19:54.860
and she's only five!

19:55.444 --> 19:58.280
Keith's coming for him, everyone!
This is unplanned!

19:58.363 --> 20:01.450
Watch out, Chris. Control your mind
and you control your body.

20:01.533 --> 20:06.079
-Keith, tear his fucking balls off!
-Keith the Cremator sucks!

20:06.163 --> 20:08.665
Keith the Cremator sucks!

20:08.749 --> 20:12.711
Keith the Cremator sucks!
Keith the Cremator sucks!

20:12.794 --> 20:14.922
Keith the Cremator sucks!

20:15.005 --> 20:16.506
All right, big mouth, you so tough?

20:16.590 --> 20:18.217
Get in this ring and show me what's up!

20:18.300 --> 20:20.135
-Yeah, you!

20:20.219 --> 20:21.386
All right. You got it, pal!

22:20.964 --> 22:25.177
I really felt like you had a long,
uncomfortable history with the Cremator.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.262
Holy shit! That felt amazing!

22:27.345 --> 22:30.057
You know what I did?
I thought about Mike from the steak house.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.310
Guy doesn't even memorize the specials.
That's so fuckin' lazy, right?

22:33.393 --> 22:35.270
-That was awesome.
-Thanks, man.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.521
I'm proud of you!

22:36.605 --> 22:38.440
Oh, shit. You got blood.

22:38.523 --> 22:39.900
Huh?

22:39.983 --> 22:42.319
I'm bleeding

22:42.402 --> 22:44.029
Holy shit, my first battle wound!

22:44.112 --> 22:47.324
You better stay away from vampires,
'cause they're gonna tear you up.

22:47.407 --> 22:48.742
Hilarious, Bertie.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.827
All right. Come on, let's go.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.080
-You do look cool.

22:53.163 --> 22:57.000
Like a brave soldier
with a very small cut on his head.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.711
Ah, I'm still pumped.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.215
Phew.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.258
I needed that.

23:05.759 --> 23:09.262
It felt like a little push
in the right direction or something.

23:10.097 --> 23:13.558
Now I can't seem
to shake Mike from my brain!

23:13.642 --> 23:16.770
Oh, sorry.
Is it really that bad with this guy?

23:16.853 --> 23:20.565
I feel like a lot of the waiters there
think I'm a joke.

23:21.274 --> 23:25.695
I moved to LA to be a stuntman,
and I'm not even close to doing it at all.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.573
Chin up!
You got pushed through a table tonight.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.700
Yeah, I did.

23:31.618 --> 23:32.744
I don't know.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.498
I've got three months left
on my lease at the Springwood. Part of me feels like
maybe I shouldn't renew it.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.295
You're thinking about leaving?

23:42.379 --> 23:44.965
Maybe it'd be easier
to move back to Chicago

23:45.048 --> 23:47.801
and not have to pay $2,300 a month
in rent.

23:47.884 --> 23:50.595
Holy shit! I thought you lived there
because it's cheap.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.973
No, that place is a paradise.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.268
You do realize all those apartments
are fully furnished, right?

23:57.102 --> 24:01.231
Listen, you've got three months left
on that lease. Let's make them count.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.482
You're not leaving LA

24:02.566 --> 24:04.734
until you've given it a real shot
as a stuntman,

24:04.818 --> 24:08.572
and I'll try to do something new and cool
in that time, too.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.574
Like go back to Bar Body.

24:10.991 --> 24:14.161
I really hated it,
but I paid a lot for the classes.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.121
-He's-- He--

24:16.705 --> 24:18.456
That happens sometimes in here.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.834
-I don't care. It's cool.
-Very casual.

24:22.419 --> 24:26.131
Well, thank you for the most
action-packed birthday ever.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.175
Awesome night.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.511
How about a birthday hug
and then I'll let you go?

24:31.595 --> 24:32.804
-Okay.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.064
Oh, Bertie, wait.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.400
I didn't get your number.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.235
Yeah.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.653
You want to do that?

24:48.737 --> 24:50.989
-Let's swap numbers.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.492
-That's easy.

24:53.575 --> 24:54.576
Here you go.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.999
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.418
Happy birthday again.

25:03.501 --> 25:06.880
-Thank you. You made it so fun.
-Oh, yeah. Thanks for coming with.

25:06.963 --> 25:08.798
-And get home safe.
-You, too.

25:08.882 --> 25:09.883
Thanks. -Night!
-Bye.

25:13.678 --> 25:14.554
Bye.

25:24.731 --> 25:25.857
Randy?

25:26.441 --> 25:27.442
Hey, Bertie.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.157
What is all this?

25:34.241 --> 25:36.535
I wanted to give you something special
for your birthday, but...

25:37.077 --> 25:40.497
since I was trapped in the house all day,
I had to Postmates this cake.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.832
That is so nice.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.885
-It melted a little bit.
-Mm-hmm.

25:57.806 --> 26:01.017
I also bought you some fresh toilet paper.

26:01.726 --> 26:06.439
But I had to open it
and use some of it, so...

26:07.023 --> 26:09.109
Oh, wow!

26:09.192 --> 26:11.236
It smells so good in here.

26:11.861 --> 26:16.908
Yeah. I lit all your scented candles
because of, you know...

26:17.659 --> 26:19.202
the shit smell.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.455
I'm sorry I couldn't hang out
with you today.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.874
Happy birthday, Bertie bear.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.919
Aw... Thanks, bear.

26:34.175 --> 26:35.176
What are you gonna wish for?

26:36.469 --> 26:38.847
Oh... I can't tell.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.308
Otherwise, it won't work.

26:44.811 --> 26:45.812
I wished for...

26:46.479 --> 26:50.233
my colonoscopy to come back positive or...

26:51.192 --> 26:53.528
you know, everything to come back good.

26:53.611 --> 26:54.779
Yeah.

26:54.863 --> 26:55.864
Should we eat?

27:00.493 --> 27:01.786
