01:22.840 --> 01:26.674
Bud, have you ever
done this before?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.480
What? You mean have sex?

01:29.760 --> 01:31.716
Yeah. Hundreds of times.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.958
Well, l mean, with someone.

01:37.800 --> 01:41.315
Well, girls don't usually ask me that
until after the deed.

01:44.440 --> 01:48.592
l'm sorry, l'm just a little nervous,
what with your parents right next door.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.115
Look, Jamie...

01:51.360 --> 01:53.237
...you see these locks?

01:53.480 --> 01:56.552
l have never, ever been caught
doing anything with myself.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.918
Look, no one can possibly
disturb us.

02:03.160 --> 02:08.996
l guess l'm just being paranoid.
And the truth is, l do want you.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.037
Badly.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.516
Then that is how you shall have me.

02:25.920 --> 02:27.876
Hi, son.

02:28.120 --> 02:31.556
Don't mind me.
Just keep on doing what you're doing.

02:32.440 --> 02:35.034
l can't find my Big 'Uns.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.720
You haven't seen any Big' Uns
have you, son?

02:39.720 --> 02:41.039
No, Dad.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.869
And, obviously, l won't be seeing
these "'Uns," either.

02:45.400 --> 02:49.029
Yeah. See, it's a special edition:
Big 'Uns Behind Bars...

02:49.240 --> 02:52.596
...and, in my humble opinion,
best damn magazine ever published.

02:53.320 --> 02:56.835
Why would l need that kind of stuff?
You know l slay the babes.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.196
Yeah, l see that.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.233
Here it is. My Big 'Uns.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.591
" Chain gang."

03:20.280 --> 03:21.759
So...

03:24.760 --> 03:26.113
...where were we?

03:26.360 --> 03:29.750
l was just buttoning up my cut-offs
and saying goodbye...

03:29.960 --> 03:31.791
...until you got your own place.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.679
Jamie, Jamie, no, no. Listen, listen.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.798
Listen, the reason
l'm living at home...

03:38.440 --> 03:40.795
...is to help out with dad.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.871
See...

03:43.120 --> 03:45.429
...he hasn't been himself...

03:45.680 --> 03:47.796
...well, since Desert Storm.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.750
He was there?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.718
No...

03:53.960 --> 03:56.713
...but he watched
the whole thing on CNN.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.358
l am so sorry.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.470
Take me now.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.188
Bud, have you seen my red bra?

04:16.200 --> 04:19.749
We got the stuff out of your son's room.
Where do you want to move this junk?

04:19.959 --> 04:22.076
Don't know, don't care.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.276
The boy said he'd have
an apartment by 6:00.

04:24.480 --> 04:29.190
So, in the words of his loving mother,
" Keep moving until l tell you to stop."

04:29.440 --> 04:33.399
Or, in the words of my loving husband,
"The sooner it's out of here the better."

04:36.000 --> 04:39.879
Al, l can't believe our baby boy
is finally moving.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.156
Baby boy, Peg?

04:42.400 --> 04:45.472
He's older than you tell people
you are.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.678
l was very young when l got married.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.195
And l was very drunk.

04:56.760 --> 05:00.719
So where's the cool guy who is ready
to leave home and bag some babes?

05:01.200 --> 05:02.792
Right here.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.475
Please, you can't even bag
your own wife.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.358
l can bag her, but it doesn't do me any
good, l remember what she looks like.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.038
Marcie, fruit.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.078
Peggy, this basket
is a gift for Bud.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.913
lt's very thoughtful.

05:25.120 --> 05:28.157
But l'm sure he wouldn't want it
if l touched it.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.073
Or coughed on it.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.790
Or throw dirt all over it.

05:43.280 --> 05:47.034
Gee, l can't imagine
why Bud would ever want to leave here.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.596
But, God, l do remember
my first apartment.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.274
My roommate and l were both single.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.836
Bursting with ripe,
flowering womanhood.

05:58.080 --> 06:02.949
The sexual revolution was in full swing,
and we were a-happening.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.313
l bet you were having sex
all the time.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.278
No.

06:09.520 --> 06:13.593
That cheap slut of a roommate
stole all my boyfriends.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.308
l've never forgiven Mom for that.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.189
Well, let me tell you a little bit about
my own swinging bachelor pad.

06:24.440 --> 06:27.591
Mirror ball on the ceiling,
waterbed on the floor...

06:27.800 --> 06:30.837
...fake medical degrees on the wall.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.398
God, l have fun at that place.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.959
Have?

06:40.440 --> 06:43.079
Jefferson, you don't still own
that place, do you?

06:47.760 --> 06:52.231
No. And it's not where l go Thursdays
when l say l'm playing racquetball.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.509
Hey, you guys,
here comes Bud across the lawn.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.990
Everybody get down, be quiet.

06:59.240 --> 07:02.073
l think it'd make him feel good
if we all yelled, "Surprise."

07:02.280 --> 07:04.316
Forget that.
We are gonna yell, "Get out!"

07:05.640 --> 07:07.631
Get out!

07:08.320 --> 07:09.594
What?

07:10.600 --> 07:13.637
Yeah. Turn in your key.
All your stuff is in the street.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.957
Here is a lovely fruit basket
from your mother and father.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.114
Hold on to your filthy grapes, Dad.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.396
l couldn't find an apartment
l could afford.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.719
You know, son, the best way to ruin
a heartfelt goodbye party...

07:29.920 --> 07:32.309
...is to stay where
you're not wanted.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.791
Now, we bought you a lovely cake.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.190
The least you could do is get out.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.917
The most you can do
is take your mother with you.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.551
Al, you cannot just throw him out
in the cold.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.518
No, no, no. Dad's right.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.832
He deserves to be " Menendez-ed"
but he's right.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.629
No, l can't go on living upstairs.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.996
l guess l'll just go find
a box somewhere.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.037
Fine.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.674
Oh, Bud, don't be so down.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.037
Listen, l have the perfect place
for you to move into.

08:07.280 --> 08:12.115
lt's lonely, it's grungy,
it's creepy, it's you.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.918
The basement.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.954
Kelly...

08:17.160 --> 08:19.037
...you may have
just hit on something.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.714
And for once it's not a married man.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.350
The basement. Lots of cool guys
live in the basement, right?

08:26.600 --> 08:28.397
Yeah, the coolest.

08:28.640 --> 08:33.077
Uncle Fester. Cousin ltt.

08:33.320 --> 08:37.313
That silly guy with the butterflies
from Silence of the Lambs.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.030
lt's gonna be the coolest pad
in town.

08:40.280 --> 08:44.159
lt's gonna be the Mecca of chick-dom,
the North Pole of nookie.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.630
l'm gonna put in new carpets,
new lights-

08:46.880 --> 08:50.395
-New third step.
-Oh, my God!

08:53.960 --> 08:58.238
So, Peggy, what are you gonna do
with Bud's old room?

08:58.480 --> 09:00.835
Well, you know,
l've always wanted someplace...

09:01.040 --> 09:02.996
...l could just stretch out
and do nothing.

09:03.760 --> 09:06.399
Well, get in the car.
l'll take you to the morgue.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.598
Come on, Al. You should be proud...

09:09.800 --> 09:12.189
...that your son is moving out
and becoming a man.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.750
My son is burrowing down
and becoming a mole.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.231
Besides, as bad as this is, you know
something worse is gonna happen.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.671
Don't you know that all horrible things
happen in threes?

09:22.920 --> 09:24.512
Celebrity deaths.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.910
Pauly Shore movies.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.230
Wilson Phillips.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.633
And, in my own case, marrying Peg.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.475
Bud not moving out.
And three, two, one:

09:36.720 --> 09:39.075
Al, something horrible
has happened.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.470
The hell you say.

09:43.080 --> 09:46.117
That was Dad.
He and Mom had this big fight.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.158
And now Mom left
and he can't find her.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.755
Did he look behind the Rockies?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.958
Excuse me, oink-boy.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.871
But aren't you concerned about your
mother-in-law's whereabouts?

10:00.120 --> 10:03.908
l know where the blubbering beast
doth blow.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.398
Where?

10:23.120 --> 10:29.150
Margaret, open the door!
lt's your mother, and l'm hungry!

10:42.560 --> 10:46.917
You know, Peg, l hate it
when your mom weebles down here...

10:47.520 --> 10:52.310
...for her little midnight snacks
which last till 9 in the morning.

10:52.840 --> 10:55.513
Mom does not eat between meals.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.955
No, Peg. Because in order to eat
between meals...

10:58.160 --> 11:00.958
...the first meal has to end.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.800
Al, don't you know how traumatic
this is for me?

11:04.040 --> 11:06.508
l now come from a broken home.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.398
As do l.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.788
Give Mom a break, she's distraught.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.429
She is humongous.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.597
l'm just retaining water.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.718
The Hoover Dam is retaining water.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.475
She is retaining Skittles.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.712
Did someone say Skittles?

11:27.920 --> 11:31.117
Al, l don't wanna come
from a broken home.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.909
Mom said she'd take Dad back
if he'd come here and apologize.

11:35.160 --> 11:40.393
Please, go to Wanker County
and bring my daddy home. Please.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.108
Peg, you know l hate going to
Wanker County.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.999
l could end up as pie filling.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.471
Did someone say pie filling?

11:50.120 --> 11:52.315
On the other hand,
same could happen upstairs.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.999
Okay, l'll go, Peg.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.070
You know what, Bud?
l've gotta hand it to you...

12:00.280 --> 12:02.555
...your new room looks pretty good.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.069
When Jamie gets here,
she'll wanna sleep with me?

12:05.320 --> 12:06.799
Well, no.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.396
l said your room looks good.
You still look like you.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.073
Kelly, could you help me
give grandma a pedicure?

12:18.360 --> 12:20.112
Sure, Mom.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.716
What's the point? lt's not like grandma
can even see her feet.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.990
Bud, what was so important
that l had to drop everything-

12:47.200 --> 12:49.589
Which happened to be my
baby brother.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.950
and rush right over here?

12:52.200 --> 12:54.475
l did it, l found a new place...

12:54.720 --> 12:58.838
...and l was hoping you and l could
christen it, if you know what l mean.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.875
Bud, that sounds great.

13:02.080 --> 13:06.073
l hope it's by the lake. l used to date
this guy that lived by the lake...

13:06.320 --> 13:08.550
...and every time l went through
the front door...

13:08.800 --> 13:14.636
...all l wanted to do is rip off
my clothes and make love.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.594
So where is your place?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.756
lt's by the lake.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.196
Let's go.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.273
We can't.

13:28.480 --> 13:32.029
The bidet, it's not firing properly.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.476
But l have an equally romantic
suggestion.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.994
Let's do it right here?

13:38.240 --> 13:40.151
You're such a kidder.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.158
Call me when your place is ready.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.632
Hey, Efrum, how much do you want
for this here reading lamp?

14:04.840 --> 14:06.876
That ain't no reading lamp, Twitchy.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.237
That is my wife's old eating lamp.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.599
She used to use it at night
while l was asleep.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.549
l'd be counting sheep
and she'd be eating them.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.189
Okay, how much do you want
for this here eating lamp?

14:22.440 --> 14:23.668
lt ain't for sale.

14:23.880 --> 14:27.475
lt's my wife's, and l miss her.
Give it to me.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.038
No, no. Please, no.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.755
Who the hell would put a bear trap
in an outhouse?

14:36.280 --> 14:40.193
They wouldn't. lt isn't no bear trap.
That's a human trap.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.078
Why would you want
to trap a human?

14:42.280 --> 14:45.670
l don't know, ask the bears.
They was the ones who put it in there.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.470
Can you get it off me, Efrum?

14:48.720 --> 14:52.599
The bear trap or that tarantula
you got there on your neck?

14:52.840 --> 14:55.229
That works every time, don't it?

14:56.200 --> 15:01.558
So, Al, what do you hear
from my bigger half?

15:03.800 --> 15:05.313
Plenty.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.312
She's moved in with me.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.475
Well, l might have known.

15:12.720 --> 15:16.110
She always thought
you were hot stuff.

15:16.360 --> 15:20.717
Mr. City-Slicker, with your shoes.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.631
Efrum, l'm not dating her.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.996
No, l'm caging her.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.158
Hey, Efrum, how much do you want
for that wading pool?

15:34.400 --> 15:36.960
That ain't no wading pool.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.272
That's my little darling's shower cap.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.471
lt isn't for sale, you son-of-an-onion.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.154
Efrum, if you're not selling anything
of your wife's...

15:48.400 --> 15:51.233
...what the hell are you having
a divorce sale for?

15:51.480 --> 15:54.870
Well, because l'm lonely.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.271
And my psychotherapist told me
that either l should try this...

15:58.480 --> 16:02.951
...or get up on that water tower
and start picking off cousins.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.118
You know, Efrum...

16:08.360 --> 16:13.036
...it's my impression that, A, you've got
some serious toxins in your well water.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.317
Or, B, you still miss the wife.

16:16.560 --> 16:21.839
Well, A, l don't drink nothing
but sour mash and Robitussin.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.911
And, B...

16:24.520 --> 16:28.229
...when it does wear off,
l do kind of miss her.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.955
Of course, l don't cough no more.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.030
There is still light
at the end of the tunnel.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.999
She swallow a comet again?

16:40.320 --> 16:42.515
No, she misses you
and she wants you back.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.438
All you gotta do is say you're sorry.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.712
l'm sorry.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.553
Not to me, you corn nut.

16:56.200 --> 16:59.351
To her. You just come on back
with me, say you're sorry...

16:59.560 --> 17:02.950
...she'll take you back and
l'll even throw in a pair of my shoes.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.791
-Show me how they work too?
-Sure.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.712
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.036
Efrum, hang on there a second.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.430
You know, you're a braver man
than l am.

17:11.680 --> 17:16.390
lf my wife left me, l'd be dancing on
the deck of the good ship hooter-pop.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.630
With a smile on my face
and my face on a smile.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.874
God, the times that l've had.
But you know...

17:27.119 --> 17:30.157
...in a strange way,
l have to respect your loyalty.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.510
lt's not every man
who would stand by a woman...

17:32.720 --> 17:35.518
...who is large enough
to have her own fire escape.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.470
No, Efrum,
l've gotta hand it to you...

17:40.240 --> 17:41.798
...you're gone.

17:42.840 --> 17:45.070
Efrum, get back here,
you son-of-an-onion.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.508
Bear trap.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.156
Hi, Peg, l'm back. Good night.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.828
Al, where's Dad?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.755
He's not coming, Peg.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.754
-Good night.
-Hey, what happened?

18:05.000 --> 18:09.232
Peg, he was all set to come back...

18:09.440 --> 18:13.115
...and then, somehow or another,
someone- l'm not saying who.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.596
-said something
about good ship hooter-pop.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.395
Before you know it,
a 70-year-old hillbilly...

18:19.600 --> 18:21.636
...was popping wheelies
on a thresher...

18:21.840 --> 18:24.798
...and saying how he'd never
marry a family member again.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.433
This is all your fault.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.148
You have ruined
a perfectly happy marriage.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.073
Yet, l remain
in a perfectly dreadful one.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.477
lf you men only knew what we do
to keep a marriage alive.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.553
Watching Oprah all day so that
we have something interesting...

18:39.760 --> 18:43.230
...to talk to you about.
Dressing like this to keep you excited.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.313
Taking beauty naps
to reverse the aging process...

18:46.560 --> 18:50.758
...and spending all your money
so you feel like a good provider.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.240
That is how l sacrifice
for you, Al Bundy.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.950
lt is a thankless, exhausting job,
but l do it...

19:05.160 --> 19:08.516
...and the only thing l ask in return
is that you bring Dad back here...

19:08.720 --> 19:09.994
...and you failed.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.639
You know what this means?

19:11.880 --> 19:15.111
No, Peg. Not sex now, Peg.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.754
No, Peg. Peg, no.

19:17.960 --> 19:21.919
Peg, please, l just need
a little more time. l'll find him.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.435
l want you to help me
give Mom a sitz bath.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.389
Can't we have sex instead?

19:35.400 --> 19:39.678
-Later. Right now Mom needs her bath.
-Okay.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.676
-Would you ever leave me, Al Bundy?
-First chance l get, Peg.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.710
Fine. Then you can scrub her front.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.154
Can't you just feel the mist
from the lake?

20:11.560 --> 20:14.233
Can l take this off now?

20:14.680 --> 20:15.908
Allow me.

20:16.120 --> 20:19.157
l meant my blindfold, you horn-dog.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.631
Not yet. lt will spoil the surprise.

20:22.880 --> 20:28.876
Okay, now we're in the lobby walking
past my trusted doorman, Rodney.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.554
Rodney, this is Jamie.

20:32.480 --> 20:36.598
Rodney, you lout. Take that.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.312
Sorry, Lord Bundy.

20:42.360 --> 20:46.911
Okay, now we're getting
into the elevator here.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.879
Bud, it doesn't feel like it's going up.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.997
Oh, it is.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.596
So, what do you think?

21:14.000 --> 21:18.073
l think you did a great job
fixing up your parent's basement.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.198
When did you know?

21:24.000 --> 21:28.596
When you put the blindfold on me,
sat in the driveway, and went...

21:29.600 --> 21:31.716
...for 20 minutes.

21:32.920 --> 21:35.912
But l think what you did
was very sweet...

21:36.160 --> 21:40.073
...and to tell you the truth,
it turns me on.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.997
And it is private.

21:43.240 --> 21:47.028
So as they say at the lakefront,
let's do the wiggly.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.194
Everybody duck and cover,
grandma got out of the tub...

21:55.440 --> 21:57.510
...she's about to shake herself dry.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.959
There she blows.

22:02.305 --> 22:08.703
