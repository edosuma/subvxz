But the river of
dread runs deep.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.160
Full of unspeakable things.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.640
The creature don't mess around.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.120
I don't wanna mess with him.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.560
I don't wanna sail,
I don't wanna sail,

09:43.680 --> 09:50.000
I don't wanna, I don't
wanna sail tonight.

09:50.120 --> 09:55.440
Dirty Creature's got me at adisadvantage from the inside.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.400
[ominous music]

10:02.000 --> 10:03.560
You're OK?

10:03.680 --> 10:05.040
Of course.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.520
Never bullshit a
bullshitter, Cheryl.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.640
That's the price we pay.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.960
Fear.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.160
Never knowing, when
they step out that door,

10:14.280 --> 10:15.160
if they're going to come back.

10:18.000 --> 10:18.960
Shall I let you in on a secret?

10:21.600 --> 10:24.160
They always come
back, the West boys.

10:28.160 --> 10:32.320
Well, except for that timeTed went to prison, right?

10:32.440 --> 10:34.720
The Smith and Caughey's job?

10:34.840 --> 10:35.760
Wolf told me.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.120
That was different.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.440
What was it like
for you on your own?

10:40.560 --> 10:41.360
I wasn't on my own.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.400
I had wolf.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.360
[knock on door]

10:43.480 --> 10:44.800
CAROL: Only me.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.160
Evening, Carol.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.200
Sparky.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.520
Mrs. O'Driscoll.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.880
RITA: Cheryl, why
don't you take Sparky

10:50.000 --> 10:51.480
and go and get some tonic.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.320
We'll be needing it for our gin.- Why do I have to do it?

10:53.440 --> 10:55.360
Just take what youneed from the turn, love.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.000
So you in a match
about the job?

10:58.120 --> 10:59.600
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.280
I think it's cool to stealfrom a robot money machine.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.760
Right.

11:03.880 --> 11:04.960
That's how dad died.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.320
Stealing from a security van.

11:06.440 --> 11:10.680
Yeah, I got that
a while ago, Sparky.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.160
[music on intercom]

11:14.800 --> 11:16.160
Grab the tonic.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.440
So I'm going to nickstuff from your own dearie?

11:17.560 --> 11:19.160
I don't have a
problem if you don't.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.640
That's stolen.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.360
Serves you right for leavingthe counter unattended.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.840
You're the one who
left us unattended.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.200
What?

11:30.320 --> 11:32.680
Nothing.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.480
Sucks with them being
down in the [inaudible]

11:34.600 --> 11:35.960
me having to do everything.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.880
I thought mom was
back from there.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.040
Jeanette wrote Wolf
on her arm with a knife.

11:41.160 --> 11:44.160
Everyone freaked out, so
she had to drive down.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.240
Jeanette goes
off the deep end.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.760
Again.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.240
Meanwhile, I have to get
up at 6 AM for the bread

11:50.360 --> 11:52.480
delivery and the bloody milk.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.880
You have to come
back and help me.

11:54.000 --> 11:54.760
How about no?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.040
Does no work for you?

11:56.160 --> 11:56.920
Bitch.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.040
I can help, if you like.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.200
Ew, no.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.160
CAROL: I thought you
didn't have any tonic?

12:03.280 --> 12:05.520
I'm just sick of hermoping and her doughy eyes.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.480
Are you OK with
taking Sparky back?

12:10.600 --> 12:11.480
Oh, sure.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.560
I'm used to his ways.

12:12.680 --> 12:13.640
It makes no difference.

12:13.760 --> 12:14.840
CAROL: Good.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.120
Because I've had a
much better idea.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.920
I'm going to buy a baby.

12:19.040 --> 12:19.840
Sorry?

12:19.960 --> 12:21.000
Buy a baby.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.960
This way, I can
even pick the colors

12:23.080 --> 12:24.160
that match me and Phineas.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.160
You got the route?

12:25.280 --> 12:28.640
DARIJO: Ted West.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.080
How's the head?

12:30.200 --> 12:32.840
Nothing that Dalmatian
coffee can't fix.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.680
Good coffee.

12:35.800 --> 12:40.200
So I take it, because you'rehere, you've accepted my terms.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.240
TED: Well, you didn't giveme much choice, did you?

12:43.360 --> 12:44.760
Yeah, 50 it is.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.680
Uh, but I haven't
told the boys yet.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.960
They need their
heads in the game.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.080
Wise, wise.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.680
All right boys, you're up.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.600
We shall not let you
down as we let them

12:59.720 --> 13:00.800
down, if you know what I mean.

13:00.920 --> 13:01.680
Yeah, I got it.

13:01.800 --> 13:02.840
Thanks, Falani.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.720
[tense music]

13:05.840 --> 13:08.680
Hey, um, look after them, OK?

13:08.800 --> 13:09.560
Sure thing.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.800
Jesus, Falani, could you'vestolen us a smaller bloody car?

13:17.920 --> 13:19.680
Did you pinch
this from a midget?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.560
Mr. West said to get
something inconspicuous.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.120
Do you know what
conspicuous means?

13:23.240 --> 13:26.400
Sure.It means small, doesn't it?

13:26.520 --> 13:29.360
[grunting]

13:42.840 --> 13:45.640
Most of the babies you
can buy come from China,

13:45.760 --> 13:48.520
but I just don't know if
I want a communist baby.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.320
So that's why I'm veeringtowards South America.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.320
Like Poncharello off CHiPs?

13:53.440 --> 13:54.240
Imagine that.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.760
Me with a Mexican baby.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.720
Wow, you've really
thought this through.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.440
Unfortunately, it is veryexpensive, what with all

14:00.560 --> 14:02.040
the bribes and everything.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.480
So, fingers crossed
for tonight, eh?

14:04.600 --> 14:05.360
Fingers crossed.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.960
CAROL: You took your time.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.720
Found an old bottle atthe back of the cupboard.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.080
Mhm.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.920
RITA: So pull up a seat,
pour yourself a drink,

14:17.040 --> 14:18.920
and join the gang with us.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.480
BURT: You want to be honest,I don't want to talk about it.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.280
But I thought you andRita were great together.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.200
Yeah, but we're not, OK?

14:25.320 --> 14:26.120
Fine.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.560
Sorry for asking.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.400
BURT: Yeah, well, do Iask you about gay things?

14:30.520 --> 14:32.400
BILKEY: You can, if you want.

14:32.520 --> 14:33.920
BURT: That's OK.

14:34.040 --> 14:34.880
I'm good.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.800
Off home to the
little lady, are you?

14:52.920 --> 14:55.600
What's that supposed to mean?

14:55.720 --> 14:57.080
Nothing.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.360
It's an expression, likegood night or see you later.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.400
Those are bothexpressions that fare well.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.080
Off home to the little
lady is an observation.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.600
Like right now, I'm
observing that you're

15:07.720 --> 15:10.880
being a bit of a bit of adick, Detective Cunt-stable.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.360
NGAIRE: Oh, girls,
for heavens sake.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.560
CHELSEA: Stop it.
LISA: What?

15:18.680 --> 15:19.440
CHELSEA: You know.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.320
LISA: No I don't, stupid.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.720
Mom, she farts and itstinks up the whole room.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.600
I do not fart.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.520
It's the room.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.840
It smells funny.

15:27.960 --> 15:28.960
NGAIRE: I do not need
to hear about farts

15:29.080 --> 15:30.240
when I'm trying to cook dinner.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.320
CHELSEA: Why do we
have to share a room?

15:31.440 --> 15:32.600
Why can't we have
a bigger house.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.760
Yeah, mom.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.480
Maybe we can all
go live with daddy.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.680
That is not going to happen.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.920
ERIC: So a guy walks into a barwith a pair of jumper cables

15:48.040 --> 15:49.600
around his neck.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.680
The bartender turns to him andsays, right, I'll let you stay,

15:51.800 --> 15:54.040
but don't start anything.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.600
PHINEAS: Why did he
have jumper cables?

15:55.720 --> 15:58.040
ERIC: Well, the jumpercables for starting the car,

15:58.160 --> 16:00.360
but the barman was talking
about starting a fight.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.480
FALANI: Jumper cables wouldbe most useful in a fight.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.240
You could use him to strangle,or use them to punch.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.000
PHINEAS: Who punches in a fight?

16:07.120 --> 16:08.160
Right, that's it.

16:08.280 --> 16:09.680
I'm making an
executive decision.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.120
We're moving.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.840
This is team alpha.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.720
We're on the move, over.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.880
Yeah, roger that, over.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.680
It has begun?

16:18.800 --> 16:19.600
It has begun.

16:24.920 --> 16:28.160
ERIC: Like father, like son, eh?

16:28.280 --> 16:31.040
CAROL: This is the worst
part for us gang wives,

16:31.160 --> 16:32.760
the waiting game.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.040
Not knowing.

16:34.160 --> 16:34.920
Anything could happen.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.840
One time, Phineas cameback covered in horse piss.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.720
The Evan Dowrascals job.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.480
Then there was the time Leftypulled a muscle in his groin.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.160
Lefty's always pulling
a muscle in his groin.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.520
In all seriousness,
the job is a lot more

16:53.640 --> 16:55.320
physical than you'd expect.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.120
[falani breathing hard]

16:59.640 --> 17:01.400
I shouldn't have had
that third pudding?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.200
CAROL: Remember when theyall got hearing loss?

17:04.320 --> 17:06.800
Phineas was thinking thephone was always ringing,

17:06.920 --> 17:11.800
and then he would pick it upand say, I can't hear anything.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.280
We don't talk about that job.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.320
Jesus.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.040
Look at the state of it.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.600
I'm having serious doubts youcan handle this, Fat Albert.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.120
I can do it, Mr. Lefty.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.440
I'm all good.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.800
It's just the stairs
I have a problem with.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.560
WOLF: Hey, I'm the one
at the end of the rope.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.560
And I trust Falani
with my life, OK?

17:31.680 --> 17:33.240
I won't let you down.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.720
Well, I will let
you down the wall.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.480
But I won't fail
to let you down.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.800
I mean, I won't fail you.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.160
- You ready?
- Yep.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.080
All good.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.960
Whoa, shit!

18:07.080 --> 18:07.960
Shut up!

18:08.080 --> 18:09.000
What are you doing?

18:09.120 --> 18:10.720
It's my hands.
They're sweaty.

18:15.200 --> 18:15.960
It just slips.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.880
I have no control.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.720
PHINEAS: You can't leave
him half way all night.

18:19.840 --> 18:20.800
You have to lower him down.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.160

You OK?

That's my knee.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.200
Oh, Jesus.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.600
What the fuck are those
clowns doing up there?

18:48.560 --> 18:49.720
[radio static]

18:49.840 --> 18:51.280
LEFTY: [ON RADIO]
The eagle has landed.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.680
Repeat, the eagle has landed.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.360
They're in?

18:55.480 --> 18:56.240
They're in.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.960
Yes!

18:59.080 --> 19:01.200
You seem kind of pumped
about this, Darijo.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.120
Fuck you.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.000
Aren't you?

19:03.120 --> 19:04.240
A jobs a job.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.680
Why do you care so much?

19:05.800 --> 19:09.040
Well, after Evan
fucking laced us,

19:09.160 --> 19:10.720
business has fallen to shit.

19:10.840 --> 19:14.560
So crime is the
future, my friends.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.800
Could I miss the future?

19:16.920 --> 19:18.200
You bet.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.120
[tense music]

19:29.080 --> 19:30.480
ERIC: Just the
way it is in that?

19:30.600 --> 19:31.400
FALANI: Close enough.

19:34.280 --> 19:35.240
Those are drugs?

19:35.360 --> 19:36.440
Nah, it's just a joint.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.080
It'll help you unwind.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.640
What if I get addicted?

19:39.760 --> 19:40.880
Oh, Jesus, man.

19:41.000 --> 19:41.800
It's dope.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.320
It's natural.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.400
You know, in fact, many culturesused it as a pain killer

24:50.840 --> 24:52.200
Why is he inside?

24:52.320 --> 24:54.600

25:02.600 --> 25:04.080
Why just him?

25:04.200 --> 25:05.840
