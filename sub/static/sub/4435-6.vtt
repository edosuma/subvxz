Oh, hey, Kyle.
Kyle, hang on a sec.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.415
- Hey, Jimmy. What's up?
- Not much.

00:42.541 --> 00:43.624
I just wanted to make sure
you've heard

00:43.750 --> 00:45.249
the f-f-fantastic news.

00:45.375 --> 00:46.874
There's a new Terrance
and Phillip mobile game,

00:47.000 --> 00:48.582
and it's so amazing
and incredibly fun.

00:48.708 --> 00:49.832
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

00:49.958 --> 00:51.415
And the most
unbelievable part --

00:51.541 --> 00:52.499
It's totally free!

00:52.625 --> 00:54.290
You should download it
to your phone right now.

00:54.416 --> 00:55.290
I mean, come on.

00:55.416 --> 00:56.665
If it's free,
why wouldn't you?

00:56.791 --> 00:59.749
Cool. Thanks, Jimmy.
Well, I'll check it out.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.665
You betcha, pal.

01:07.083 --> 01:08.915
The "Terrance & Phillip"
mobile game!

01:12.750 --> 01:14.957
In this game,
you are Terrance and Phillip.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.582
Can you collect
all the Canadian coins?

01:22.083 --> 01:24.165
That's one coin.
Can you collect more?

01:26.625 --> 01:28.665
You've collected
10 Canadian coins!

01:28.791 --> 01:29.957
Congratulations!

01:30.083 --> 01:32.540
Hey, you're really good
at this, guy.

01:32.666 --> 01:35.415
- What?
- Congratulations, Kyle.

01:35.541 --> 01:37.124
With Canada coins,
you can buy stuff

01:37.250 --> 01:39.165
and help Terrance and Phillip
rebuild Canada.

01:39.291 --> 01:40.499
Run around and collect
more coins,

01:40.625 --> 01:42.332
or better yet,
buy them in bulk.

01:42.458 --> 01:44.915
How man Canadian coins
would you like to buy?

01:45.041 --> 01:46.082
This is stupid.

01:46.208 --> 01:48.707
Well, it's just 49 cents
for the cheapest one.

01:49.958 --> 01:52.207
You bought 200 Canadian coins
for 49 cents!

01:52.333 --> 01:53.207
You're amazing!

01:53.333 --> 01:56.124
Now use that Canadough
to help rebuild Canada.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.665
Click to build a hospital here.

01:59.625 --> 02:00.832
- Yay!
- Yay!

02:00.958 --> 02:03.207
It's still stupid,
and now I paid 49 cents for it.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.915
What are
you two boners doing?

02:05.041 --> 02:07.124
We're playing the "Terrance &
Phillip" freemium game.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.790
I played that thing.
It's fucking dumb.

02:08.916 --> 02:10.374
I ended paying
like five bucks.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.665
Who makes this crap?

02:18.083 --> 02:20.457
Oh, it's tewiffic!

02:20.583 --> 02:23.790
That's 200,000 more American
dollars in just one day.

02:23.916 --> 02:25.790
Where is the roof
on this thing?

02:25.916 --> 02:28.082
What's the big idea
making a mobile game

02:28.208 --> 02:29.332
without our approval?

02:29.458 --> 02:30.707
Oh, Terrance and Phillip.

02:30.833 --> 02:32.582
How are Canada's
two favorite buddies?

02:32.708 --> 02:33.749
What gives you the right
to make

02:33.875 --> 02:35.082
a stupid "Terrance & Phillip"
mobile game?

02:35.208 --> 02:36.082
Who do you think you are?

02:36.208 --> 02:37.957
Oh, I'm only
the prince of Canada.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.665
And this happens to be
the minister of mobile gaming.

02:40.791 --> 02:41.999
We thought
you would be pleased

02:42.125 --> 02:43.499
with the quality
of the mobile game.

02:43.625 --> 02:44.957
It's the dumbest game ever.

02:45.083 --> 02:47.040
All you do is collect
and spend Canadough.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.957
Hey, we know
the game's not great.

02:49.083 --> 02:50.874
But who cares?
It's free!

02:51.000 --> 02:52.040
But it's not free.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.374
If you charge 40 cents here
and 50 cents there,

02:54.500 --> 02:55.624
then it's not free.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.457
They see through the charade.

02:58.583 --> 02:59.790
Uh-oh.
You think so?

02:59.916 --> 03:01.457
I think they see
through the charade, yes.

03:01.583 --> 03:03.540
I'm pretty sure
they can hear us, too.

03:03.666 --> 03:04.790
All right.
Fuck it.

03:04.916 --> 03:06.457
You've seen
through the charade,

03:06.583 --> 03:08.290
so you might as well
know everything.

03:08.416 --> 03:09.332
Charade up!

03:15.958 --> 03:17.624
Allow me to explain the science

03:17.750 --> 03:19.707
behind micro-pay
freemium gaming.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.582
For years, the concept
behind gaming was simple --

03:22.708 --> 03:24.790
you pay for the game,
and you enjoy.

03:24.916 --> 03:26.415
With mobile apps,
we now have the ability

03:26.541 --> 03:28.582
to make games
that are boring and stupid,

03:28.708 --> 03:31.290
but if you pay for incentives,
you're rewarded.

03:31.416 --> 03:34.749
"Freemium" -- the "mium"
is Latin for "not really."

03:34.875 --> 03:36.249
It's a simple cycle,

03:36.375 --> 03:38.582
a never-ending loop
based on RPGs.

03:38.708 --> 03:40.582
Explore, collect,
spend, improve.

03:40.708 --> 03:43.165
But whereas those just use
the concept of XP,

03:43.291 --> 03:44.457
or experience points,

03:44.583 --> 03:47.790
we've introduced the idea
of micro-paying with money.

03:47.916 --> 03:49.832
Money, money, money,
money, money, money.

03:49.958 --> 03:52.915
It's what everyone is doing.
Freemium games are what's now.

03:53.041 --> 03:55.957
And it's all just
a lot of harmless fun.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.040
You're in big trouble,
Stanley.

03:58.166 --> 04:02.374
Can you explain to us
how you managed to spend $489

04:02.500 --> 04:03.957
on a mobile app?

04:04.083 --> 04:06.665
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I spent that much.

04:06.791 --> 04:08.332
You didn't realize?

04:08.458 --> 04:10.499
What are "Canadian coins"?

04:10.625 --> 04:12.832
You buy Canadian coins
so you have Canadough.

04:12.958 --> 04:15.415
Stan, just because I make
a good living with my music

04:15.541 --> 04:17.832
doesn't mean you can go
blow it all on Canadough.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.957
- I'll pay you back for it, okay?
- How?!

04:20.083 --> 04:21.290
I don't know!
I'll figure it out!

04:21.416 --> 04:22.790
Jesus Christ.

04:22.916 --> 04:24.082
Can you believe him?

04:24.208 --> 04:25.665
He knew how much
he was spending.

04:25.791 --> 04:28.249
He knew he'd get in trouble,
but it didn't matter.

04:28.375 --> 04:29.957
I hate to say it,

04:30.083 --> 04:31.999
but this is a lot like
his Grampa.

04:32.125 --> 04:33.040
What do you mean?

04:33.166 --> 04:34.915
Dad's always had
a gambling problem.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.832
He's got total
addiction tendencies.

04:37.958 --> 04:42.040
Could he have somehow passed
those demons down to Stan?

04:42.166 --> 04:45.165
Well, and you certainly have
some of those problems, too,

04:45.291 --> 04:46.207
with drinking.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.665
I had a problem,
but I was able to stop.

04:48.791 --> 04:51.332
Now I only drink
gluten-free beer and wine.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.915
But with Stan, I think there's
some darkness inside him

04:55.041 --> 04:58.040
that doesn't allow him
to stop.

05:00.458 --> 05:01.832
And so, in conclusion,

05:01.958 --> 05:05.374
the successful freemium game
is based on five principles --

05:05.500 --> 05:07.999
entice the player
with a simple game loop,

05:08.125 --> 05:09.915
use lots of flashing
"cha-chings" and compliments

05:10.041 --> 05:11.749
to make the player feel good
about themselves,

05:11.875 --> 05:14.332
train the players to spend
your fake currency,

05:14.458 --> 05:16.665
offer the players a way
to spend real currency

05:16.791 --> 05:17.957
for your fake currency...

05:18.083 --> 05:19.957
So they'll forget
they're spending money.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.707
...and make the game
about waiting,

05:21.833 --> 05:23.415
but let the player pay
not to wait.

05:23.541 --> 05:25.457
It's a surefire way
to make lots of money.

05:25.583 --> 05:27.207
We understand micro-paying,

05:27.333 --> 05:29.040
but can't the game
hidden inside the charade

05:29.166 --> 05:30.624
just at least be fun?

05:30.750 --> 05:33.582
No, no!
It has to be just barely fun.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.040
If the game was too fun,

05:35.166 --> 05:36.707
then there would be no reason
to micro-pay

05:36.833 --> 05:38.707
in order to make it more fun.

05:38.833 --> 05:39.707
What's this?

05:39.833 --> 05:40.749
Your checks, of course,

05:40.875 --> 05:44.999
for 10 million American dollars,
each.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.207
So this is --
Everyone is doing this?

05:47.333 --> 05:48.707
Everyone is doing it!

05:48.833 --> 05:50.374
It's just the way things
are going.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.749
It's the way
things are going!

05:52.875 --> 05:55.915
Well, I guess if everyone's
just paying 40 cents at a time,

05:56.041 --> 05:57.915
it can't be that bad.

05:59.208 --> 06:00.832
Hey, Phillip!

06:01.958 --> 06:03.999
Oh, hey, guys.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.749
You missed school today?

06:05.875 --> 06:08.415
Yeah, I just
wasn't feeling the best.

06:08.541 --> 06:10.999
Did you play the "Terrance &
Phillip" freemium game all day?

06:11.125 --> 06:13.249
Well, yeah, I was sick in bed.
What else was I gonna do?

06:13.375 --> 06:15.332
How much money
did you micro-pay today, Stan?

06:15.458 --> 06:16.332
Nothing.

06:16.458 --> 06:18.332
Dude, I bought like $10 worth
of Canadough.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.457
But check it out.
I unlocked a stadium in Toronto.

06:20.583 --> 06:23.999
You spent $10 and eight hours
to unlock a stadium?

06:24.125 --> 06:26.874
You guys, is it that much dumber
than video games you play?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.124
Yes.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.874
It's just, like,
something to kill some time.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.790
Like Jimmy said,
it's a cool way to zone out.

06:31.916 --> 06:34.332
Wait, wait, wait.
Jimmy told you about this game?

06:34.458 --> 06:36.040
Jimmy told me
about this game.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.957
Kenny, who told you
about this game?

06:38.083 --> 06:39.290
Mrph rm.

06:39.416 --> 06:41.040
- Dude, what...
- the...

06:41.166 --> 06:42.624
Fmph?

06:44.416 --> 06:46.832
Psst. Hey, kid.
Come over here.

06:46.958 --> 06:49.124
Yeah, come on over.
C-Check this out.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.582
You looking to have
some fun?

06:51.708 --> 06:52.790
What do you mean?

06:52.916 --> 06:54.374
The "Terrance & Phillip"
mobile game.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.790
All the cool kids
are using it.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.790
- Aw, I don't know.
- Come on. Just try it out.

06:57.916 --> 06:59.499
You can be Terrance,
or Phillip, or both.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.624
You can walk around and collect
Canada cash to build new stuff.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.040
It's the perfect thing
if you're bored.

07:03.166 --> 07:04.790
And honestly, the best part
about it is it's free.

07:04.916 --> 07:05.957
I mean, come on.

07:06.083 --> 07:07.915
Why wouldn't you download it
and just try it out?

07:08.041 --> 07:09.790
- Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?
- Well, sure, fellas.

07:09.916 --> 07:11.707
Anyway, be sure
to check it out, kid.

07:11.833 --> 07:12.957
Dude, what are you doing?

07:13.083 --> 07:14.582
Just hanging out.
What are you up to?

07:14.708 --> 07:16.290
You need to stop recommending
that app to people.

07:16.416 --> 07:16.957
Mrph!

07:17.083 --> 07:19.124
Everyone we know says they heard
about it from you.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.749
I just think it's
a fabulous app. That's all.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.165
It's not a fabulous app.
It's fucking stupid.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.999
Let me ask you something,
Jimmy.

07:25.125 --> 07:28.040
What happens on level two after
you get the Ontario nugget?

07:29.416 --> 07:31.040
All right, all right.
I never played it.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.749
I stay away from the stuff.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.082
You just push it
on other people?

07:34.208 --> 07:35.415
- They pay me to!
- Who, Jimmy?!

07:35.541 --> 07:37.332
Who pays you?!

07:39.458 --> 07:41.165
You've both done
an amazing job.

07:41.291 --> 07:42.999
New hospitals,
new neighborhoods,

07:43.125 --> 07:45.332
all funded
by one freemium game.

07:45.458 --> 07:47.790
Uh, listen, uh, we've been
talking it over,

07:47.916 --> 07:50.040
and we really aren't comfortable
with this freemium thing.

07:50.166 --> 07:51.832
Oh, what is the matter?

07:51.958 --> 07:54.332
It seems dishonest,
and we have a brand to protect.

07:55.958 --> 07:57.915
But just look at all the things
we're getting to build.

07:58.041 --> 08:00.749
Soon Canada will be as advanced
and developed as Michigan.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.874
We're just worried that some
people will abuse the game

08:03.000 --> 08:04.832
and start spending more money
than they can afford.

08:04.958 --> 08:05.915
Oh, no!

08:06.041 --> 08:08.207
Well, we certainly
wouldn't want that.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.374
Oh, I have an idea.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.540
How about we take some of

08:11.666 --> 08:13.165
the billions of dollars
we are making

08:13.291 --> 08:15.832
and we start a campaign
to teach everyone

08:15.958 --> 08:17.874
to play the game
in moderation?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.415
Ohh!

08:19.541 --> 08:20.957
Do you really think
that would help?

08:21.083 --> 08:22.124
Of course!

08:22.250 --> 08:24.999
The alcohol industry
does it all the time.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.874
You. Friends.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.290
Fun. Drink.

08:29.416 --> 08:30.665
Hot girls.
You're hot.

08:30.791 --> 08:32.415
Drink more.
Expensive cars.

08:32.541 --> 08:33.790
Ass. Drink. Ass.

08:33.916 --> 08:35.582
Money. You in a tuxedo.
Threesomes.

08:35.708 --> 08:37.332
Vodka. Pussy.
Drink, drink, drink!

08:37.458 --> 08:38.999
You! Drink!
Vegas! Fun! Pussy!

08:39.125 --> 08:40.957
You in a tuxedo
fucking this girl!

08:41.083 --> 08:42.082
Vodka!
Drink, drink, drink!

08:42.208 --> 08:43.415
Drink it all,
you fucking pussy!

08:43.541 --> 08:44.582
More tuxedos!
More cars!

08:44.708 --> 08:45.665
More pussy!
More vodka!

08:45.791 --> 08:46.832
Drink, drink, drink!

08:46.958 --> 08:50.082
Please drink responsibly.

08:55.875 --> 08:58.040
Come on.
This way, Stan.

08:58.166 --> 09:00.665
I want you to see this.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.249
There you go.
That's your Grampa.

09:03.375 --> 09:06.332
He sits at that slot machine
and mindlessly drains money away

09:06.458 --> 09:07.457
a little bit at a time.

09:07.583 --> 09:08.457
Sound familiar?

09:08.583 --> 09:10.874
All the little sounds and lights
are calculated

09:11.000 --> 09:13.415
to keep him sitting
at that stupid machine.

09:13.541 --> 09:15.124
Come on, Dad.
We're going home.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.874
Ah, go away.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.499
Do you know what you've done
to your grandson?

09:18.625 --> 09:21.582
You've infected him
with your bullshit!

09:21.708 --> 09:23.582
What are you talking about?

09:23.708 --> 09:26.499
I just don't understand
what is wrong with you two.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.457
What is the joy that this stuff
possibly brings you?

09:29.583 --> 09:31.332
- It's just...
- It's fun.

09:31.458 --> 09:32.540
Yeah, it's fun.

09:32.666 --> 09:33.832
It's not fun!

09:33.958 --> 09:36.457
You two have demons
you're trying to compensate for.

09:36.583 --> 09:39.415
Well, what about you?
You're having a glass of wine.

09:39.541 --> 09:41.290
I'm not having
a glass of wine.

09:41.416 --> 09:42.457
I'm having six.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.332
It's called a tasting,
and it's classy.

09:45.458 --> 09:47.665
Dad, I'm not addicted.
I can stop.

09:47.791 --> 09:49.665
I just like playing it,
but I don't have to.

09:49.791 --> 09:50.874
I'll prove it.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.749
Yeah, and if he stops,
I'll stop.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.165
All right.

09:54.291 --> 09:57.999
And if you two stop, then we
won't have a problem anymore.

09:58.125 --> 09:59.165
Hmm.

09:59.291 --> 10:01.749
Earthy, bold,
hint of cherry after-tones.

10:07.791 --> 10:10.790
Is it my responsibility
what people decide to do

10:10.916 --> 10:12.832
with their f-f-free time?

10:12.958 --> 10:13.999
I was just the middleman.

10:14.125 --> 10:15.749
People were going to learn
about the game somewhere

10:15.875 --> 10:16.749
if not from me.

10:16.875 --> 10:17.999
I'm not the one
who made it.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.332
But you accepted money
from the Canadian government

10:20.458 --> 10:21.790
to push a freemium game on us.

10:21.916 --> 10:23.499
Why would they do that?

10:23.625 --> 10:25.040
How do you get people
addicted to crack?

10:25.166 --> 10:26.290
You give it away for free.

10:26.416 --> 10:27.874
You give away a little taste,
and then --

10:28.000 --> 10:29.540
and then some people
can't stop themselves.

10:29.666 --> 10:32.499
And now Stan is so consumed
by the shit you've been pushing

10:32.625 --> 10:33.749
that he can't even
see through it!

10:33.875 --> 10:35.124
How could you sell out
your friends?!

10:35.250 --> 10:37.124
I needed the money,
all right?!

10:39.000 --> 10:41.207
I downloaded
Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest

10:41.333 --> 10:42.499
because it was free.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.165
I loved
the sparkling little gems,

10:44.291 --> 10:46.540
the sounds they made
when I got new ones.

10:46.666 --> 10:48.707
Then I made my first
in-app purchase.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.415
Before I knew it,
I had spent my allowance,

10:50.541 --> 10:51.999
then my birthday money.

10:52.125 --> 10:53.624
I lost my crutches!

10:53.750 --> 10:54.832
You have your crutches.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.457
It's a figure of speech
with crippled people.

10:56.583 --> 10:57.749
We'd say we lost
an arm and a leg,

10:57.875 --> 10:59.207
but they ain't worth much.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.207
That makes sense.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.374
You're saying these games
do this on purpose?

11:02.500 --> 11:03.582
Why do you think
freemium games

11:03.708 --> 11:04.915
send you those
text notifications

11:05.041 --> 11:06.249
when you haven't played
in a while?

11:06.375 --> 11:07.749
It's called a trigger --

11:07.875 --> 11:10.082
a quick image to trigger
the addict's brain.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.249
They know exactly
what they're doing.

11:20.208 --> 11:22.874
Hey, buddy!
Come on, guy!

11:26.583 --> 11:29.582
Come back, friend.
You've got new buddies, guy.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.957
We've just given you
5,000 Canadian coins.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.999
Enjoy your Canadough.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.665
Free?

11:42.666 --> 11:44.874
What is wrong with you,
Stan?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.124
You said you stopped
buying Canadough.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.457
I didn't think
I spent that much.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.457
I-I clicked on a few micro-pays
and it just kind of added up.

11:51.583 --> 11:53.874
$26,000?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.665
Do you know how many songs
I have to write

11:55.791 --> 11:57.040
to make back that much money?

11:57.166 --> 11:58.040
One.

11:58.166 --> 12:00.290
Oh, it's just nothing to you,
isn't it?

12:00.416 --> 12:01.874
No.
No, it's not.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.999
You need to realize that you
have something in your brain

12:04.125 --> 12:06.040
that you somehow inherited
from your Grampa

12:06.166 --> 12:08.040
that makes you act
this way, okay?

12:08.166 --> 12:09.290
I don't know
how you can say that

12:09.416 --> 12:10.832
when you're standing here
chugging beer.

12:10.958 --> 12:12.332
I am not chugging beer.

12:12.458 --> 12:15.374
I'm sampling a flight
of gluten-free German lagers

12:15.500 --> 12:16.665
with a French wine pairing.

12:16.791 --> 12:20.457
It's called a schmorgeswein,
and it's elegantly cultural.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.832
Okay, I need help.

12:33.958 --> 12:36.540
There is something different
about me, you guys.

12:36.666 --> 12:38.165
I know the game is stupid,

12:38.291 --> 12:40.457
and it actually
isn't even fun anymore.

12:40.583 --> 12:41.707
I don't understand.

12:41.833 --> 12:43.999
Fellas, could I have a minute
with Stan, please?

12:44.125 --> 12:46.874
Sure.
Come on, guys.

12:48.125 --> 12:49.040
This is my fault, Stan.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.915
I should have never told you the
game was f-f-f-fan-- fantastic.

12:52.041 --> 12:52.915
It's not your fault.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.749
It's something to do
with my family.

12:54.875 --> 12:55.832
It's like a curse.

12:55.958 --> 12:57.374
I know this stuff
is hard to understand.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.040
Trust me, I know.

12:59.166 --> 13:01.624
I'm an addict, too.
But I got help.

13:01.750 --> 13:02.832
How?

13:02.958 --> 13:05.707
What all the addiction programs
say is true --

13:05.833 --> 13:07.874
You've got to reach out
to a higher power, Stan.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.249
You've got to get down
on your knees

13:09.375 --> 13:11.707
and you've got to say,
"I have a problem."

13:11.833 --> 13:14.707
And you've got to ask
that higher power for help.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.540
We have to find a way
to get the word out.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.582
People need to know
pushers are being hired

13:21.708 --> 13:23.790
to take advantage of people
with addiction problems.

13:23.916 --> 13:25.707
There has to be a way
we can get to the news company

13:25.833 --> 13:27.915
and sneak in and somehow borrow
their TV signal.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.040
If we could disguise ourselves
as something ridiculous --

13:30.166 --> 13:31.124
Okay, it's done.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.999
- What's done?
- The word is out.

13:33.125 --> 13:34.165
"Terrance and Phillip
hire pushers

13:34.291 --> 13:35.249
to make money off addicts."

13:35.375 --> 13:38.499
I tweeted it.
It's trending.

13:40.958 --> 13:42.207
You son of a bitch!

13:42.333 --> 13:43.457
You paid pushers

13:43.583 --> 13:45.957
to get addicts hooked
on our freemium game?

13:46.083 --> 13:46.957
You what?

13:47.083 --> 13:48.374
Now, hold on,
Terrance and Phillip.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.874
There's nothing wrong
with promoting a mobile game.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.207
But there's something
very wrong

13:52.333 --> 13:54.499
with knowingly make it appeal
to human weaknesses!

13:54.625 --> 13:58.207
You didn't build a mobile game.
You built an addiction machine!

13:58.333 --> 14:00.249
Minister of Mobile Gaming,
what's this all aboot?

14:00.375 --> 14:03.290
All right, all right. You've
seen through the charade again.

14:03.416 --> 14:06.749
Let me explain
how freemium games really work.

14:08.875 --> 14:12.249
The truth is a very small
percentage of people

14:12.375 --> 14:14.582
who download freemium games
ever pay anything for them.

14:14.708 --> 14:17.290
It's all aboot finding
the heaviest users

14:17.416 --> 14:20.124
and extracting the most amount
of cash from them.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.624
That's how you get addicts
to pay 200 bucks

14:22.750 --> 14:24.915
for a game
that's not even worth 40 cents.

14:25.041 --> 14:28.124
But then all our profits
come from people with problems.

14:28.250 --> 14:31.082
Don't think aboot that.
Think about all the money.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.165
Here, have a bump of coke.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.499
Okay, but we still
won't stand for this!

14:41.541 --> 14:43.499
I don't know
if you're listening,

14:43.625 --> 14:47.790
but I guess I have something
inside me that I can't control,

14:47.916 --> 14:50.624
something kind of dark.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.624
Please, help show me the way.

15:00.083 --> 15:04.874
You have summoned the prince
of temptation for what purpose?

15:05.000 --> 15:05.874
Oh, shit.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.374
Uh, I have addiction demons,
and I don't understand them.

15:09.500 --> 15:15.624
Then allow me to explain
the darkness of the human soul.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.915
So you've got dopamine, right?

15:19.041 --> 15:20.999
That's the chemical
that gets released in your brain

15:21.125 --> 15:23.915
whenever you do something
pleasurable like eating, sex.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.082
And that's just nature, right?

15:25.208 --> 15:26.790
Like,
rabbits and fish and shit,

15:26.916 --> 15:30.040
they need dopamine so that they
want to consume and reproduce.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.040
Okay.

15:31.166 --> 15:32.707
But because humans
have progressed

15:32.833 --> 15:34.832
and now have access
to all the shit they want

15:34.958 --> 15:35.874
whenever they want it,

15:36.000 --> 15:39.332
it's easy for them to overdo
and have dopamine problems.

15:39.458 --> 15:41.749
You know, it's not fucking
rocket science, this stuff.

15:41.875 --> 15:44.249
So there's nothing
spiritually wrong with me?

15:44.375 --> 15:45.332
Fuck no.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.540
It's like --
okay, it's like being diabetic.

15:47.666 --> 15:49.582
You know, it's like you can
eat wrong and eat wrong,

15:49.708 --> 15:51.999
and chemicals get released
from your liver in a weird way.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.624
You know, you've been
eating gluten and shit.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.499
And then eventually
you've got a chemical imbalance

15:55.625 --> 15:56.540
from your liver.

15:56.666 --> 15:59.040
And something clicked and now
you're diabetic forever, right?

15:59.166 --> 16:01.290
So, like, if you keep doing
something too much,

16:01.416 --> 16:04.249
eventually there's, um,
a dopamine fuck-up, right,

16:04.375 --> 16:06.207
and you're kind of
screwed up for life.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.207
So, what does that mean?

16:07.333 --> 16:09.415
I can get addicted to everything
so I can't enjoy anything?

16:09.541 --> 16:11.665
Yeah, that's pretty much
what it means.

16:11.791 --> 16:14.540
The addict people said something
about me filling a hole.

16:14.666 --> 16:16.915
Well, who's not filling
a fucking hole, right?

16:17.041 --> 16:19.582
You know? I mean,
what kind of bullshit is that?

16:19.708 --> 16:21.332
So, let's talk
about genetics now.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.332
- You still have time?
- Yeah, no, this is great.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.040
Okay, let me get
some visual aids.

16:25.166 --> 16:26.707
Give me just a sec.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.749
Here is a fact --

16:30.875 --> 16:34.832
80% of alcohol sales
are paid for by alcoholics.

16:34.958 --> 16:36.540
Using slot-machine tactics,

16:36.666 --> 16:38.415
freemiums games
are able to make millions

16:38.541 --> 16:41.332
off of an even smaller
percentage of mobile gamers.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.082
Oh, God,
he just doesn't stop!

16:43.208 --> 16:44.707
Who is this guy?!

16:44.833 --> 16:48.332
We're building a new Canada with
micro-payments from addicts.

16:48.458 --> 16:49.540
Who cares?!

16:49.666 --> 16:51.665
You think the fucking
alcohol industry cares?

16:51.791 --> 16:54.374
They don't care
that 10% are gonna get addicted.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.207
They're counting on it!
It's the same with us.

16:57.333 --> 17:00.290
But we've got our eyes
on every addict's screen.

17:00.416 --> 17:02.124
Every button they click,

17:02.250 --> 17:04.207
we get feedback
on how to shove this shit

17:04.333 --> 17:05.957
right down their throats.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.790
Why does he suddenly sound
like Al Pacino

17:07.916 --> 17:09.165
in "Devil's Advocate"?!

17:09.291 --> 17:12.374
Oh, I'm much worse
than the devil.

17:16.916 --> 17:19.624
I'm the Canadian devil!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

17:19.750 --> 17:22.415
Oh, dear God!
It's the Canadian devil!

17:22.541 --> 17:23.540
Beelzaboot!

17:23.666 --> 17:25.290
You discovered my plan,
but too late!

17:26.083 --> 17:28.624
Now the souls of all Canadians
belong to me!

17:28.750 --> 17:30.665
Oh, no!
Oh, what have I done?!

17:30.791 --> 17:32.874
Hee hee hee! Ha ha ha!

17:33.000 --> 17:35.707
So, basically, the genes
you got from your dad

17:35.833 --> 17:37.874
make you more likely
to have trouble

17:38.000 --> 17:39.749
with, um,
dopamine regulation,

17:39.875 --> 17:41.499
and that's why you need to
kind of watch out

17:41.625 --> 17:42.915
for addictive stuff.

17:43.041 --> 17:45.624
Okay, so we kind of
understand now, champ?

17:45.750 --> 17:46.290
I guess so.

17:46.416 --> 17:47.582
But why do companies
have to put

17:47.708 --> 17:48.957
so many addictive things
out there?

17:49.083 --> 17:51.040
You know, they all do it,
and it's kind of my deal.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.790
I've got to put temptation
out there, too,

17:52.916 --> 17:54.665
so people have free will
and all that shit.

17:54.791 --> 17:56.707
But, you know, everyone has
their justification

17:56.833 --> 17:58.124
and thinks what they're doing
is okay.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.707
Hey, buddy, where'd you go?
Don't you want more Canadough?

18:01.833 --> 18:02.749
What's this?

18:02.875 --> 18:04.040
That's what
I've been addicted to.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.832
It's a freemium game
sending me push notifications.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.582
What, you just collect coins?

18:14.458 --> 18:16.624
How much money
can you buy today?

18:16.750 --> 18:19.582
No, see, if something's
addictive because it's fun,

18:19.708 --> 18:20.665
that's one thing.

18:20.791 --> 18:24.332
But this is just blatant
Skinner box manipulation.

18:24.458 --> 18:27.082
Wait a minute.
Who put this out?

18:27.208 --> 18:28.290
Uh, Canada.

18:28.416 --> 18:32.124
Oh, that son of a bitch.
He's always doing this shit!

18:32.250 --> 18:34.790
I tell him
temptation has to be nuanced,

18:34.916 --> 18:37.082
but he goes and does
this crap again.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.832
I'm gonna need to borrow
your soul real quick, kid.

18:39.958 --> 18:40.874
Is that all right?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.374
Okay.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.332
Aaaaah!

18:47.458 --> 18:49.957
Oh, pass interference!
Interference!

18:51.791 --> 18:53.374
Stan?
Where are you going?

18:53.500 --> 18:57.915
I shall return.
Do not attempt to stop me.

18:59.083 --> 19:00.665
Told ya.
Kid's got demons.

19:00.791 --> 19:03.457
I don't do that.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.165
Horror and sadness
all over Canada tonight.

19:07.291 --> 19:08.624
When the prince
signed the agreement

19:08.750 --> 19:09.624
to make a freemium game,

19:09.750 --> 19:12.415
he apparently made a deal
with the Canadian devil.

19:12.541 --> 19:14.707
Hey, guy!
I'm the Canadian devil!

19:15.666 --> 19:17.207
The Canadian devil
now has complete control

19:17.333 --> 19:18.624
of the souls
of every Canadian.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.874
This is a sad day for Canada
and, therefore, the world.

19:24.833 --> 19:26.499
I stab you!

19:26.625 --> 19:27.832
Oh!

19:30.041 --> 19:31.540
Beelzaboot!

19:31.666 --> 19:35.082
Once again,
you lack any sense of nuance.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.082
Who the fuck is that?

19:36.208 --> 19:39.332
Well, well.
My overachieving doppelganger.

19:39.458 --> 19:41.332
You're no match
for Canadian Satan!

19:42.458 --> 19:45.332
Return from whence you came!

19:45.458 --> 19:46.915
Aah!
Watch it, guy!

19:54.083 --> 19:55.915
Certainly a shocking
turn of events here

19:56.041 --> 19:57.707
as the actual devil
has now appeared

19:57.833 --> 19:59.790
and seems to be fighting
the Canadian devil.

19:59.916 --> 20:01.957
This is certainly a conundrum
for Canadians everywhere

20:02.083 --> 20:03.624
as we try to figure out
who to root for.

20:03.750 --> 20:06.207
For that, let's ask the minister
of sport in Edmonton.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.790
Well, of course,
the patriotic thing to do

20:07.916 --> 20:09.249
would be to root
for the Canadian devil.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.415
But then again,
he is the one

20:10.541 --> 20:12.790
who has promised us pain and
servitude for a million years.

20:12.916 --> 20:14.415
Screw that!
Go, Canada!

20:14.541 --> 20:16.207
Enough, Beelzaboot.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.582
Thy end has come!

20:33.583 --> 20:35.665
- Hey, dude.
- Hey.

20:35.791 --> 20:37.332
You all right?

20:37.458 --> 20:39.874
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.499
Cool.

20:43.958 --> 20:47.165
My fellow Canadians,
what we do now as a country

20:47.291 --> 20:49.165
will hopefully be a model
for others.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.957
We have all learned
a tragic lesson together

20:52.083 --> 20:53.832
that though many sins
are out there,

20:53.958 --> 20:55.999
when you get involved
with freemium gaming,

20:56.125 --> 20:58.249
you are making a deal
with the Canadian devil.

20:58.375 --> 21:00.457
We will no longer make
freemium games,

21:00.583 --> 21:03.082
and we will no longer make
improvements to our country

21:03.208 --> 21:04.540
with money taken from addicts.

21:04.666 --> 21:06.165
Canada is back to being

21:06.291 --> 21:09.082
an ethical, respected,
shitty tundra.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.832
I'm gonna move here and here,

21:13.958 --> 21:15.832
and then I'm gonna roll
to kill this zombie.

21:15.958 --> 21:18.582
Okay, good idea.

21:18.708 --> 21:19.790
What are you gaywads doing?

21:19.916 --> 21:20.874
We're playing board games

21:21.000 --> 21:22.457
so that Grampa avoids
the casino

21:22.583 --> 21:23.582
and I avoid freemium apps.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.957
Well, all right!
Good for you guys.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.540
Tell you what,
I'll join you.

21:27.666 --> 21:29.540
Board games go good
with a glass of wine.

21:29.666 --> 21:31.374
That's not a glass,
that's a trophy,

21:31.500 --> 21:32.957
that you won for drinking.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.207
It's not "drinking."

21:34.333 --> 21:36.207
It's called a wine zinfandel
sipping sprint,

21:36.333 --> 21:37.457
and it's competitive.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.249
Get off
your high fucking horse.

21:39.375 --> 21:40.332
Your turn, Grampa.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.707
If you roll a five or six,
you can kill these zombies.

21:42.833 --> 21:45.249
You guys want to put
some money on it?
