WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:06.700
Captain's Log, Stardate 48693.2.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.968
We've altered course
to investigate

00:09.042 --> 00:10.976
some unusually intense
photonic activity

00:11.044 --> 00:12.978
in a nearby protostar.

00:13.046 --> 00:15.207
Lieutenant Torres and l
are beaming aboard samples

00:15.281 --> 00:17.306
for further analysis.

00:18.885 --> 00:20.250
Containment field is active.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.582
We're ready for transport.

00:21.654 --> 00:22.882
Energize.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.220
That's strange.

00:27.293 --> 00:29.158
Both containers
should have been filled.

00:30.563 --> 00:31.689
Here's the problem.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.824
A slight breach
in the annular confinement beam.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.663
l'm aborting transport.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.726
Okay, let's try that again.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.328
Energizing.

00:41.941 --> 00:43.772
All right.

00:43.843 --> 00:46.004
l'll get a complete
phase spectrum analysis

00:46.079 --> 00:47.546
on this as soon as possible.

00:47.614 --> 00:50.048
lf this photonic matter
works as well as l think,

00:50.150 --> 00:51.481
it could boost the efficiency

00:51.551 --> 00:53.178
of our power converters
15 percent.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.345
l'd say more like 20.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.889
How long will it take to finish
the preliminary analysis?

00:56.956 --> 00:59.948
Um, six hours, maybe more.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.790
l'd like to get it
sooner than that.

01:02.862 --> 01:05.194
l believe Ensign Kim
is off duty.

01:05.265 --> 01:06.357
Could you use his help?

01:06.433 --> 01:08.526
Can you convince him to
give up his free time?

01:08.601 --> 01:10.330
l think l might be able to.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.461
Janeway to Kim.

01:12.505 --> 01:13.631
That's odd.

01:13.706 --> 01:15.503
Computer, locate Ensign Kim.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.974
Unable to comply.

01:17.043 --> 01:19.011
Ensign Kim
is not aboard the ship.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.279
Sensor logs show no record

01:23.349 --> 01:25.408
of any unauthorized
transporter activity,

01:25.485 --> 01:27.646
and all shuttlecraft
are accounted for.

01:27.720 --> 01:28.880
lf Ensign Kim left the ship,

01:28.955 --> 01:30.980
he did not do so
by conventional means.

01:31.057 --> 01:33.525
His last shift ended
four hours ago,

01:33.593 --> 01:34.890
and he was scheduled for time

01:34.961 --> 01:36.553
on Holodeck 2
when he went off duty.

01:36.629 --> 01:37.823
No one has seen him since.

01:37.897 --> 01:38.886
Scan the holodeck.

01:42.902 --> 01:44.597
What's the matter?

01:44.671 --> 01:46.832
There is significant
interference in the holodeck.

01:46.906 --> 01:49.374
l cannot obtain a clear scan.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.773
ls it a system malfunction?

01:50.844 --> 01:52.607
l do not believe so.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.308
Commander.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.381
The holodeck
is definitely active.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.924
There appears to be
a program in progress.

02:05.992 --> 02:07.584
Can you shut it down?

02:07.660 --> 02:10.151
The manual overrides
are not functioning.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.596
l cannot terminate the program.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.293
All right, let's go in.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:40.413 --> 04:42.847
Computer, identify program.

04:42.915 --> 04:46.373
The program in progress
is a holonovel based

04:46.452 --> 04:48.386
on the epic Earth poem Beowulf.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.217
Beowulf?.

04:50.290 --> 04:54.386
An ancient English epic
set in sixth century Denmark,

04:54.460 --> 04:55.950
if l remember correctly.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.826
lt's about a hero named Beowulf

04:57.897 --> 05:00.593
who fights a creature
that's terrorizing a kingdom

05:00.667 --> 05:02.328
and murdering its subjects.

05:02.402 --> 05:05.963
Monsters and swordplay,
that sort of thing.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.165
l'm not detecting
any life signs,

05:07.240 --> 05:09.606
but there is still
considerable interference.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.337
l can't determine the source.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.243
Speak as a friend

05:15.315 --> 05:17.647
or stand challenged.

05:17.717 --> 05:20.049
Computer, delete character.

05:23.956 --> 05:27.392
The holodeck command systems
must not be functioning either.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.525
We must also consider
the possibility

05:31.597 --> 05:34.031
that the safety programs
are malfunctioning as well.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.159
l'm am Freya, shield-maiden,

05:36.235 --> 05:38.032
daughter of King Hrothgar.

05:38.104 --> 05:39.435
l hold this guard post

05:39.505 --> 05:42.269
against any intruders
who would bear us harm.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.707
So declare yourselves.

05:45.044 --> 05:46.511
l will hear your answer

05:46.579 --> 05:48.809
before you march any further
through this land.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.746
We have no desire to trespass.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.308
However, we are
on an urgent mission,

05:53.386 --> 05:54.751
so if you would allow us
to continue,

05:54.821 --> 05:55.981
we would appreciate it.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.989
What land do you call home?

05:58.057 --> 06:01.458
Your faces tell me
you are not men of the Danes.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.518
Are you...

06:03.596 --> 06:05.860
kinsmen of Beowulf?

06:07.734 --> 06:11.033
Yes.
We are Beowulf's kinsmen.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.664
My name is Chakotay,
and this is Tuvok.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.004
Have you seen Beowulf?

06:16.075 --> 06:18.509
Yes.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.546
He was like no other.

06:20.613 --> 06:25.516
Hair straight and raven black,
eyes bright with fierce fire,

06:25.585 --> 06:27.849
the burning gaze of a hero.

06:29.856 --> 06:31.756
Grandiloquence notwithstanding,

06:31.824 --> 06:34.190
that would qualify
as a description of Mr. Kim.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.353
How did you know he was Beowulf?

06:36.429 --> 06:38.294
This is Harry's holonovel.

06:38.364 --> 06:40.423
lt'd make sense
that he'd be playing the hero.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.365
She might be able
to help us figure out

06:42.435 --> 06:43.459
what happened to him.

06:43.536 --> 06:44.833
A reasonable assumption.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.532
Your kinsman was
a truly noble warrior.

06:47.607 --> 06:50.132
lt is right you should
avenge his death.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.570
Yes, but first,

06:54.647 --> 06:58.105
we'd like to know more
about how Beowulf died.

06:58.184 --> 06:59.981
Of course.

07:00.019 --> 07:02.749
Come.
l will take you to the king.

07:05.024 --> 07:06.685
Hail, Lord Hrothgar.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.488
l bring new friends,

07:08.561 --> 07:11.052
Chakotay and Tuvok,
kinsmen of Beowulf,

07:11.130 --> 07:12.825
who come to avenge his death.

07:12.899 --> 07:15.834
Greet them well.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.700
l would bid you welcome
to my hall,

07:18.771 --> 07:22.332
but the days of glad tidings
are gone from this place.

07:22.408 --> 07:25.275
We grieve with you
for your kinsman.

07:25.344 --> 07:30.475
We had hoped that a warrior
of Beowulf's strength and renown

07:30.550 --> 07:33.951
would be able to deliver us
from our curse.

07:35.321 --> 07:38.313
Could you tell us exactly
what happened to him?

07:38.391 --> 07:42.225
He met with the same fate
as did 30 of our own warriors.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.763
Grendel.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.856
That's the monster
who's been attacking you.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.527
Repelled by light and laughter,

07:49.602 --> 07:51.695
the beast waits
until we slumber.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.932
Then, bereft of remorse,

07:54.006 --> 07:57.669
Grendel comes in murderous rage
to my hall

07:57.743 --> 07:59.540
to take my people,

07:59.612 --> 08:04.208
and there is nothing
anyone can do to stop it.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.979
lf you are wise,

08:07.019 --> 08:10.785
you will forego your vengeance
and return home.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.849
Death lives here now.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.120
My Lord is fatigued.

08:15.194 --> 08:16.456
lt is time to retire.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.464
We would like
more information about Beowulf.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.830
Would it be possible
to examine his body?

08:21.901 --> 08:24.529
The body of Beowulf is gone.

08:24.604 --> 08:27.334
Dragged down to Grendel's
foul lair, no doubt.

08:27.406 --> 08:29.135
The beast leaves no traces.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.005
Did anyone actually
see the battle?

08:31.077 --> 08:34.046
No. Beowulf chose
to face Grendel alone.

08:34.113 --> 08:37.844
Then l think we'd like to see
this Grendel for ourselves.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.350
To what purpose?

08:39.418 --> 08:42.511
To raise false hopes
in our king again

08:42.587 --> 08:44.111
as did your kinsman?

08:44.190 --> 08:46.658
Leave us alone in our misery.

08:46.726 --> 08:47.658
Unferth!

08:47.727 --> 08:48.887
These men are our guests.

08:48.961 --> 08:51.521
You will show them
the hospitality they deserve.

08:51.597 --> 08:53.155
They deserve nothing!

08:53.232 --> 08:56.827
lf their Beowulf was truly
the champion he claimed to be,

08:56.903 --> 09:00.771
then Grendel would be dead,
his head mounted on a spear.

09:00.840 --> 09:04.571
lnstead, we spend yet
another night in terror.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.111
lf you would allow us

09:06.178 --> 09:09.238
to assist you, perhaps we could
help alleviate your terror.

09:10.816 --> 09:13.011
Your names mean nothing to me.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.315
There are no songs of your deeds

09:15.388 --> 09:18.380
nor stories of the battles
you have fought.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.721
Who are you to believe
you can slay Grendel?

09:20.793 --> 09:23.387
We have no intention
of slaying anyone.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.487
We simply wish to examine
the creature.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.660
Grendel might not wish
to be examined...

09:30.736 --> 09:32.829
without a fight.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.805
And if you would fight Grendel,

09:34.874 --> 09:37.775
then you will first
prove your worth to me.

09:38.778 --> 09:39.938
Defend yourselves.

09:42.114 --> 09:43.843
You are able warriors.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.248
You may stand sentry tonight.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.221
You are brave men.

09:54.293 --> 09:57.285
l hope to see you again,
fate permitting.

10:03.302 --> 10:04.701
Chakotay to Janeway.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.896
Go ahead.

10:05.972 --> 10:09.169
Captain, we haven't found
any definite signs of Harry,

10:09.241 --> 10:11.675
but we've encountered
several holodeck characters

10:11.744 --> 10:13.473
who claim to know
what happened to him.

10:13.546 --> 10:17.312
Mr. Kim was running a holonovel
based on the poem Beowulf.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.749
According
to the holo-characters,

10:19.819 --> 10:21.946
he attempted to battle
a creature of some kind

10:22.021 --> 10:23.488
and was killed in the process.

10:24.690 --> 10:25.714
Killed?

10:25.791 --> 10:28.351
Since the safety programs
are malfunctioning,

10:28.427 --> 10:29.724
we must consider
the possibility.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.491
But...
you haven't found a body?

10:32.565 --> 10:36.262
No. lf we shut down the program,
we'd know if he's here or not.

10:36.335 --> 10:37.324
Run a diagnostic

10:37.403 --> 10:39.997
on the holodeck's
imaging control systems.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.437
lf they're not working,
try to repair them.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.703
And relay your tricorder
scans to the Bridge.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.802
l'd like to analyze
your readings.

10:46.879 --> 10:49.439
Aye, Captain.
Chakotay out.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.641
The primary imaging matrix
should be here

10:53.719 --> 10:55.448
behind this wooden panel.

10:55.521 --> 10:58.547
l will attempt to locate
the auxiliary matrix.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.887
This ancient Earth culture
seems fascinated with monsters.

11:03.963 --> 11:06.488
Every culture has its demons.

11:06.565 --> 11:09.932
They embody the darkest emotions
of its people.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.833
Giving them physical form
in heroic literature

11:12.905 --> 11:15.703
is a way of exploring
those feelings.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.972
The Vok'sha of Rakella Prime

11:19.045 --> 11:22.981
believe that hate is a beast
which lives inside the stomach.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.641
Their greatest mythical hero

11:24.717 --> 11:26.981
is a man who ate stones
for 23 days

11:27.053 --> 11:29.817
to kill the beast,
and became a saint.

11:29.889 --> 11:32.187
Such fables are necessary
only in cultures

11:32.258 --> 11:35.125
which unduly emphasize
emotional behavior.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.422
l would point out

11:36.495 --> 11:38.622
there are no demons
in Vulcan literature.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.861
That might account
for its popularity.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.401
Bridge to Chakotay.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.596
Chakotay here.

11:45.671 --> 11:47.639
Commander, we've analyzed
your tricorder data.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.609
A deep-level scan shows minute
quantities of photonic energy.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.668
How could it be in the holodeck?

11:53.746 --> 11:56.044
We think it happened
when we beamed aboard

11:56.148 --> 11:57.740
the samples from the protostar.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.342
There was a breach in the
annular confinement beam,

12:00.419 --> 12:02.250
and photonic energy
must have leaked

12:02.321 --> 12:04.016
into the transporter system.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.115
And from there
into other ship systems as well.

12:06.192 --> 12:08.092
We've already found some
in the replicators.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.594
That raises an uncomfortable
possibility, Captain.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.927
lf the holodeck's conversion
nodes were contaminated,

12:13.032 --> 12:15.262
Ensign Kim may have
inadvertently undergone

12:15.334 --> 12:16.926
the process
of matter conversion.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.505
You're saying he might have
been converted into energy?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.167
We have to consider it
a possibility.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.275
After all, the holodecks
are basically an outgrowth

12:29.348 --> 12:31.179
of transporter technology.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.219
Changing energy into matter
and back again.

12:34.286 --> 12:37.380
Every time a program is run.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.515
Except it's not supposed
to convert people.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.854
Hold on, Captain.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.086
Something's coming.

12:43.662 --> 12:45.994
lt is an object approximately
one meter in diameter.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.828
l think Grendel
may be paying us a visit.

12:48.901 --> 12:50.835
Captain, the holo-characters
told us

12:50.903 --> 12:52.700
Kim was killed by Grendel.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.741
An examination of this part of
the program might be advisable.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.173
Proceed.

12:59.845 --> 13:03.246
Captain, l'm picking up signs
of matter/energy conversion.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.338
Emergency transport.

13:04.383 --> 13:05.850
Get them out of there now.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.783
l can't get a lock.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.490
Commander Chakotay, report.

13:17.663 --> 13:18.652
Mr. Tuvok?

13:18.731 --> 13:20.926
Captain, l've lost
their life signs.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.022
They're gone.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.680
This is a scan of the holodeck

13:35.748 --> 13:38.444
just before we lost contact
with Chakotay and Tuvok.

13:38.517 --> 13:40.417
The readings are pretty garbled,

13:40.486 --> 13:42.977
but l'm still inclined to think
that there is a malfunction

13:43.055 --> 13:45.455
in the holodeck's
matter conversion nodes.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.685
Photonic energy leaking
into the subsystems

13:47.760 --> 13:49.785
could certainly
damage the nodes,

13:49.862 --> 13:52.422
and it might have created
a defect in the program

13:52.498 --> 13:54.090
that occurs
when Grendel shows up.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.726
A defect that dematerialized
our people.

13:56.802 --> 13:58.599
l'm not willing
to accept the fact

13:58.671 --> 14:00.536
that Harry and the others
are gone for good.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.338
Their molecular patterns
might still be there.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.777
And if they are, we might be
able to rematerialize them.

14:07.847 --> 14:11.908
The only thing we can do is
go back into the holodeck.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.680
Study this... energy surge.

14:14.753 --> 14:15.879
Find out what exactly happened.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.047
Anyone who goes back in there

14:17.122 --> 14:18.487
might wind up
just like the others.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.020
Maybe not anyone.

14:22.094 --> 14:23.118
Me?

14:23.195 --> 14:25.629
A hologram can't be
converted into energy.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.892
lt already is energy.

14:26.966 --> 14:28.558
You're the perfect choice.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.933
How do you intend to transfer me
out of Sick Bay?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.971
We'll have to modify
your data stream protocols

14:34.039 --> 14:36.337
and imaging systems,
but the fact that you're going

14:36.408 --> 14:37.602
to the holodeck
simplifies things.

14:37.676 --> 14:40.201
The projection systems
are already in place there.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.871
And we're going
to give you complete control

14:41.947 --> 14:44.108
over your magnetic
containment field.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.980
You'll be able
to make yourself solid,

14:46.051 --> 14:47.882
or let matter pass
through you at will.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.978
Nothing on the holodeck
will be able to touch you--

14:50.055 --> 14:51.420
unless you want it to.

14:54.326 --> 14:55.418
l see.

14:55.494 --> 14:57.291
Think of this as your first
away mission, Doctor.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.160
Think of this as your first
away mission, Doctor.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.426
l can understand
your hesitation,

15:01.533 --> 15:03.865
but there are three
lives at stake,

15:03.903 --> 15:05.234
and you have the best chance

15:05.304 --> 15:07.101
of anyone on this ship
to save them.

15:08.974 --> 15:10.874
Do you understand that?

15:10.943 --> 15:12.433
Yes.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.376
Good.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.710
Your job is to find
the photonic energy surge

15:16.782 --> 15:17.908
and scan it closely.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.780
We need all the data we can get.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.114
You'll have to interact

15:21.186 --> 15:23.654
with the characters
in the holonovel,

15:23.722 --> 15:26.486
so make sure you're familiar
with the Beowulf story.

15:26.558 --> 15:30.324
Your circuit modifications
will be finished in three hours.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.728
Yes, Captain.

15:44.176 --> 15:48.636
Computer, access full text
of ancient Earth epic Beowulf

15:48.714 --> 15:51.410
including historical annotation
and cultural references.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.543
Data compilation in progress.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.552
Doctor?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.452
Ah, Kes.
Come in.

15:57.523 --> 15:59.718
l don't know
how long l'll be gone,

15:59.792 --> 16:03.057
but my absence is no reason
to suspend your studies.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.494
How are you doing
with the protein synthesis text?

16:05.531 --> 16:07.192
l finished it yesterday.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.733
Good. Then you may
as well start learning

16:08.801 --> 16:10.200
how to operate
the base-pair sequencer.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.829
You'll find the manual
in the technical data base.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.865
Was there something else?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.409
There's something bothering you.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.569
Not at all.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.669
Now if you'll excuse me,

16:20.746 --> 16:22.543
l have a great deal
of preparation to do.

16:22.614 --> 16:24.741
You're nervous about
this mission, aren't you?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.079
Nervous?

16:27.987 --> 16:31.218
l can perform emergency surgery
without getting nervous.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.918
l can make life-or-death
decisions about patients

16:33.993 --> 16:35.483
without getting nervous.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.529
What makes you think
l'm nervous?

16:37.596 --> 16:39.723
Those things
are familiar to you.

16:39.798 --> 16:42.858
You've been programmed
to do them, but...

16:42.935 --> 16:48.840
this is different, isn't it?

16:55.514 --> 16:58.813
l can describe every detail
of every piece of equipment

16:58.884 --> 17:01.785
in this Sick Bay-- from bio-bed
to neurostimulator--

17:01.854 --> 17:09.260
but l've never even seen a sky
or a forest,

17:09.328 --> 17:13.059
let alone Vikings and monsters.

17:13.132 --> 17:16.965
l can't afford to fail.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.767
But l don't know what to expect
in that holodeck.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.271
You've been telling me that you

17:22.340 --> 17:24.832
deserve to be treated
like a member of the crew.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.877
Well, here's your chance.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.641
And l can tell you

17:29.715 --> 17:31.910
that none of the crew
knows exactly what to expect

17:32.017 --> 17:34.178
when they go on an away mission.

17:37.256 --> 17:41.090
Doctor, have you chosen
a name for yourself yet?

17:42.895 --> 17:45.921
l have narrowed the list
to three possibilities.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.058
Then let me suggest
you choose one before you go.

17:51.036 --> 17:54.096
lt might help you feel more
like a Starfleet officer.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.674
Hmm.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.905
You may be right.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.469
l'll give it some thought.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.977
And Kes...

18:07.953 --> 18:09.853
thank you.

18:09.955 --> 18:11.980
Good luck.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.099
Paris to Janeway.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.691
We're ready
for the transfer, Captain.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.361
Good. Go ahead.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.405
How about you, Doctor?

18:27.473 --> 18:28.906
You ready?

18:28.974 --> 18:30.566
Of course.

18:30.642 --> 18:34.134
l've already transported
a tricorder onto the holodeck.

18:34.213 --> 18:37.910
Engaging transfer circuits...
now.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.368
ls everything all right, Doctor?

18:57.436 --> 19:01.031
Yes. There were no problems
with the transfer.

19:01.106 --> 19:03.438
l'm on my way.

19:14.386 --> 19:16.251
Speak as a friend

19:16.321 --> 19:18.983
or stand challenged.

19:19.057 --> 19:19.989
l am...

19:20.058 --> 19:22.219
Yes, you're Freya,
the king's daughter.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.524
A female warrior
known as a shield-maiden.

19:24.596 --> 19:28.032
We have never met,
and yet you know my name?

19:28.100 --> 19:30.830
Are you a sorcerer?

19:30.903 --> 19:33.599
No.

19:33.672 --> 19:37.574
lt's simply that...
your reputation precedes you.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.440
A warrior of your skill...

19:39.511 --> 19:42.139
you're quite famous
where l come from.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.816
l did not know
that word of my deeds

19:45.884 --> 19:47.613
has carried to other lands.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.210
Tell me what you have heard.

19:50.489 --> 19:54.516
Well... your battle with...

19:54.593 --> 19:56.254
Scyld the Gar-Dane?

19:56.328 --> 19:57.420
...is practically legend.

19:57.496 --> 19:58.588
An incredible story.

19:58.664 --> 20:00.928
l burned his hall to the ground.

20:00.999 --> 20:03.297
There was nothing left
but ashes!

20:03.368 --> 20:04.460
Charming.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.594
And did you hear of my campaign

20:05.671 --> 20:07.366
against the heatho-bards
to the south?

20:07.439 --> 20:08.929
l fought them for...

20:09.074 --> 20:10.769
l'd be delighted
to hear all about it,

20:10.842 --> 20:12.673
but l'm on an urgent
mission of my own.

20:12.744 --> 20:14.268
l'm looking for Grendel.

20:16.415 --> 20:19.578
Only a warrior would seek
that which others flee.

20:19.651 --> 20:21.175
What is your name?

20:21.253 --> 20:23.278
l'm glad you asked.

20:23.355 --> 20:25.823
My name is... Schweitzer.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.984
Dr. Schweitzer.

20:28.093 --> 20:29.856
''Schweitzer.''

20:29.928 --> 20:33.864
A hero's name.

20:33.932 --> 20:36.366
Come, l will take you
to the king.

20:36.435 --> 20:37.424
Hmm.

20:38.470 --> 20:41.462
The hall is not far from here.

20:43.842 --> 20:47.642
Look-- fortune is with us.

20:47.713 --> 20:50.910
Atuta-- a most powerful plant.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.951
What exactly do you
intend to do with it?

20:53.018 --> 20:56.044
We brew the atuta into a broth,
which we drink before battle.

20:56.121 --> 20:57.884
lt brings on
the spirit of the bear,

20:57.956 --> 21:00.789
and gives us strength
to swing our swords.

21:00.859 --> 21:02.724
lt's more likely to bring on
profuse sweating,

21:02.794 --> 21:04.694
convulsions, and acute delirium.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.197
This is an Amanita muscaria--

21:07.266 --> 21:09.097
a fungus common
to subartic climates,

21:09.167 --> 21:11.192
and, let me assure you,
quite poisonous.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.637
Yes, but those it does not kill,
it makes strong.

21:14.706 --> 21:16.697
A most hearty plant.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.743
Are you a master of herb-lore?

21:18.810 --> 21:21.108
Well, in a way, l suppose l am.

21:21.179 --> 21:24.842
You are truly a man of many
talents, Lord Schweitzer.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.975
Your people must
value you greatly.

21:27.085 --> 21:29.076
You would think so.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.091
Hail, Lord Hrothgar!

21:33.158 --> 21:35.649
l bring a new friend,
Schweitzer,

21:35.727 --> 21:37.422
who has come to destroy Grendel.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.964
Greet him well.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.865
l would bid you welcome
to my hall,

21:42.934 --> 21:47.132
but the days of glad tidings
are gone from this place.

21:47.205 --> 21:49.696
l'm sorry to hear that,

21:49.775 --> 21:51.538
but with your permission,
sir, l'd like to stay

21:51.610 --> 21:53.373
here tonight,
and wait for Grendel.

21:53.445 --> 21:55.310
To what purpose?

21:55.380 --> 21:58.816
To raise false hopes again,

21:58.884 --> 22:01.011
as have others before you?

22:01.119 --> 22:03.883
Leave us alone in our misery.

22:03.922 --> 22:06.117
l'm afraid l can't do that.

22:06.191 --> 22:07.658
l have a mission.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.921
Your name means nothing to me.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.429
There are no songs
of your deeds

22:12.497 --> 22:15.466
nor stories of the battles
you have fought.

22:15.534 --> 22:18.435
Who are you to believe
you can slay Grendel?

22:18.503 --> 22:21.666
l'm simply a... warrior.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.537
l'm only concerned with Grendel.

22:23.608 --> 22:25.098
l have no quarrel with you.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.337
lndeed you do,

22:26.411 --> 22:28.436
and if you will fight Grendel,

22:28.513 --> 22:33.450
then you will first
prove your worth to me.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.510
Defend yourself!

22:42.961 --> 22:44.053
Fate be with you.

22:54.673 --> 22:58.268
lf this is your best,
then you should thank me.

22:58.343 --> 23:01.904
Grendel would destroy you
with far greater ease than l.

23:03.281 --> 23:05.112
This is absurd.

23:10.355 --> 23:11.652
So be it.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.927
You might want to put
some ice on that.

23:19.998 --> 23:21.397
lt'll take down the swelling.

23:22.534 --> 23:24.934
Our time of deliverance
is at hand.

23:25.003 --> 23:28.029
We have been given
a new champion--

23:28.106 --> 23:30.336
one whom weapons cannot hurt.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.434
The one who will destroy Grendel

23:32.511 --> 23:33.944
and end our suffering.

23:34.012 --> 23:36.242
All hail the hero!

23:36.314 --> 23:39.909
-All hail Schweitzer!
-All hail Schweitzer!

23:39.985 --> 23:42.579
Schweitzer! Schweitzer!

23:42.654 --> 23:44.747
Schweitzer!
Schweitzer!

23:44.823 --> 23:46.723
Schweitzer! Schweitzer!

23:46.792 --> 23:48.851
Schweitzer!
Schweitzer!

23:48.927 --> 23:50.895
Schweitzer! Schweitzer!

23:50.962 --> 23:52.429
Schweitzer!
Schweitzer!

23:57.235 --> 23:59.567
Eat, eat.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.265
What is it?

24:01.373 --> 24:02.533
Elk.

24:02.574 --> 24:06.169
When l built this hall,
the forest ran thick with them,

24:06.244 --> 24:09.907
but today, game's more scarce.

24:09.981 --> 24:11.380
Enjoy it, Lord Schweitzer.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.941
lt is a great delicacy
in our land.

24:25.363 --> 24:28.025
Hmm. lt's quite good.

24:28.099 --> 24:31.557
We rarely hear stories
of other lands.

24:31.636 --> 24:34.537
Honor us with
a tale of your home

24:34.606 --> 24:36.164
to gladden our hearts.

24:36.241 --> 24:38.505
l'm not much of a storyteller.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.511
Please...

24:40.579 --> 24:41.603
indulge us.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.808
Yes, tell us a tale
of your prowess in battle.

24:44.883 --> 24:48.284
Well, there was the time

24:48.353 --> 24:50.651
l managed to stop the spread
of Parinisti measles

24:50.722 --> 24:52.781
before it became epidemic.

24:52.858 --> 24:55.383
For a while,
things were touch and go.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.860
Six people came down with it.

24:57.929 --> 24:59.191
Fortunately, l was able

24:59.264 --> 25:02.062
to isolate the endoplasmic virus
and replicate it

25:02.167 --> 25:03.896
in order to form an antibody.

25:03.935 --> 25:07.268
Even then, it wasn't altogether

25:07.339 --> 25:10.365
clear l could create
an effective vaccine.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.909
But l worked at it
for 7 4 hours straight,

25:13.979 --> 25:16.106
and managed to create
an inoculation

25:16.181 --> 25:17.375
that successfully protected
the crew.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.314
You'll excuse me, my Lord,

25:19.384 --> 25:22.615
if l take leave of this...
folly.

25:24.923 --> 25:27.391
A truly unique tale.

25:27.459 --> 25:29.324
Come, Lord Schweitzer.

25:29.394 --> 25:31.521
Allow me to show you my home.

25:32.998 --> 25:37.458
lf you are in need of anything,
please do not hesitate to ask.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.299
All l need is to find Grendel.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.534
You are a true champion--
always ready for the fight.

25:42.607 --> 25:44.268
Ah, perhaps you
would like some mead

25:44.342 --> 25:45.809
to fortify yourself for battle?

25:45.877 --> 25:47.572
No, thank you.
l'm fine.

25:47.646 --> 25:50.581
Away. You're disturbing
Lord Schweitzer!

25:50.649 --> 25:56.087
lt was with that weapon
l made my first kill.

25:56.154 --> 25:58.122
l was 1 1 years old.

25:58.189 --> 26:01.647
You killed someone
when you were 1 1?

26:01.726 --> 26:04.058
Well, it's a poor weapon,
l agree,

26:04.129 --> 26:05.824
but a token of my youth.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.627
You must have similar trophies
from your own childhood.

26:09.935 --> 26:14.304
l... don't remember much
about my childhood.

26:14.372 --> 26:15.532
Well, l am certain

26:15.607 --> 26:18.098
you distinguished yourself
in battle many times

26:18.176 --> 26:19.734
and did honor to your father.

26:19.811 --> 26:22.803
My Lord, it grows late.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.815
lt is time to retire.

26:24.883 --> 26:27.408
Always with you
it is time to sleep.

26:27.485 --> 26:29.214
Perhaps you have forgotten

26:29.287 --> 26:32.484
that the work of a warrior
is battle, not rest!

26:32.557 --> 26:35.151
You would do well to learn
from Lord Schweitzer.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.295
This was
a beautiful hall once...

26:40.365 --> 26:42.299
before Grendel.

26:42.367 --> 26:45.461
You will make it so again.

26:45.537 --> 26:48.506
You have our thanks.

26:49.708 --> 26:52.040
l appreciate your faith
in me, Sire.

26:57.182 --> 26:58.649
Come, my lord.

26:59.985 --> 27:02.954
You may have deceived
them with your tricks,

27:04.956 --> 27:08.357
but the king is old
and desperate for hope,

27:08.426 --> 27:10.291
and the rest are just fools!

27:10.362 --> 27:12.990
You have nothing
to worry about, Unferth.

27:13.064 --> 27:15.191
Once l'm done with Grendel,
l'll be leaving.

27:15.266 --> 27:16.733
We shall see.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.496
The morning will prove

27:18.570 --> 27:21.596
if your deeds are
as strong as your words.

27:30.582 --> 27:33.380
The nights here are cold.

27:33.451 --> 27:35.885
l wanted to make certain
you were comfortable.

27:35.954 --> 27:38.752
l appreciate your concern.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.991
l thought everyone
had gone to sleep.

27:49.300 --> 27:54.636
Sleep does not come
easily in this place.

27:54.706 --> 27:57.266
Not anymore.

27:58.977 --> 28:01.741
l was taught the world
would end in winter.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.781
First, there would
be a desperate cold,

28:04.816 --> 28:08.081
followed by a demon who
would devour the sun.

28:09.587 --> 28:13.250
lt has been long
since we felt summer,

28:13.324 --> 28:16.020
and a demon does walk
these halls.

28:18.496 --> 28:19.861
Freya...

28:19.931 --> 28:22.422
your world
isn't coming to an end.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.434
Perhaps not,

28:24.502 --> 28:26.970
but it has changed.

28:27.038 --> 28:30.337
Every night the monster comes,

28:30.408 --> 28:32.535
and every day
our numbers are lessened,

28:32.610 --> 28:34.134
and no one will speak of it.

28:34.212 --> 28:37.113
No one speaks of the fear
that he will be next.

28:37.182 --> 28:41.482
But each meal becomes
quieter than the last,

28:41.553 --> 28:45.455
and after a time,
we barely speak at all.

28:45.523 --> 28:49.516
Do you know what it is
to be alone among many,

28:49.594 --> 28:51.926
and unable to speak your fears?

28:54.099 --> 28:56.329
l think l do.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.733
How do you survive?

28:58.803 --> 29:01.397
l'm still learning how.

29:02.841 --> 29:05.537
l'm sure
that's not very helpful.

29:07.312 --> 29:08.973
Sometimes l believe

29:09.047 --> 29:12.210
l can see the moment
of my own death.

29:12.283 --> 29:15.844
lt comes in battle, l think,

29:15.920 --> 29:19.219
my sword raised high.

29:21.292 --> 29:25.251
lt is said that fate
often spares a doomed warrior,

29:25.330 --> 29:27.457
if his courage can prevail.

29:27.532 --> 29:30.763
But there have been days

29:30.835 --> 29:33.030
when l felt my own courage
falter...

29:33.104 --> 29:35.629
and then you came.

29:35.707 --> 29:38.608
l'm glad l could help.

29:38.676 --> 29:40.541
Perhaps l can help you.

29:42.580 --> 29:47.813
Before combat, it is most
important to stay warm.

29:48.853 --> 29:50.650
Well, you've done
an excellent job

29:50.722 --> 29:52.383
with the fire, l'm sure l'll...

30:04.135 --> 30:08.231
Fire is not the only heat,
Lord Schweitzer.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.275
You know where l sleep.

30:33.932 --> 30:35.593
Holodeck to Bridge.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.134
We're monitoring you.

30:37.202 --> 30:41.434
Captain, l'm picking up
readings of photonic energy.

30:47.111 --> 30:48.510
Captain, it's right
in front of me.

30:48.580 --> 30:52.539
lt's some kind of...
photonic energy formation.

30:57.121 --> 30:58.315
Emergency!

30:58.389 --> 30:59.583
Get me out of here!

30:59.657 --> 31:00.715
Now!

31:00.825 --> 31:03.123
Sick Bay, emergency transfer.

31:03.161 --> 31:04.788
l'm on it.

31:10.835 --> 31:12.132
Sick Bay, report.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.764
Uh... l have him, Captain...

31:15.840 --> 31:17.034
more or less.

31:18.843 --> 31:21.277
l think you better come
take a look at this.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.495
How does it feel?

31:41.566 --> 31:43.090
Just like the old one, actually.

31:43.167 --> 31:45.226
Apparently, contact
with photonic energy

31:45.303 --> 31:47.203
disrupted
your magnetic cohesion,

31:47.272 --> 31:48.204
but we're still not sure

31:48.273 --> 31:49.570
if that's what happened
to the others.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.802
Captain, take a look at this.

31:51.876 --> 31:53.673
The readings
from the Doctor's tricorder

31:53.745 --> 31:56.771
when the energy surge
made contact with him.

31:56.848 --> 31:59.715
They're showing
a synaptic pattern.

31:59.784 --> 32:00.978
l wouldn't expect to see

32:01.085 --> 32:03.053
something like this
in photonic energy.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.281
ls this the first time

32:04.355 --> 32:05.913
those patterns
have shown up like this?

32:05.990 --> 32:07.116
Yes, but it's the first time

32:07.191 --> 32:09.921
we've had clear readings
from a moment of contact.

32:09.994 --> 32:13.896
l wonder if l could produce
these same patterns

32:13.965 --> 32:15.626
in the samples
we have in Engineering.

32:15.700 --> 32:16.928
lf you can, you might be able

32:17.001 --> 32:19.561
to get more information
about how photonic energy

32:19.637 --> 32:20.831
damaged the holodeck systems.

32:20.905 --> 32:22.099
l'm on it.

32:22.173 --> 32:23.504
l'll give you a hand.

32:27.645 --> 32:29.340
Okay...

32:29.414 --> 32:31.644
l've initiated
a polarization field.

32:31.716 --> 32:33.980
l'm introducing it
into the container.

32:34.052 --> 32:35.713
We're getting a reaction.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.779
lt's producing a synaptic
pattern all right--

32:38.856 --> 32:40.756
highly complex.

32:41.793 --> 32:42.782
What's that?

32:46.965 --> 32:49.433
Whatever it is, it's cutting
through the bulkheads.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.990
Let's get a containment field
around it.

32:51.069 --> 32:53.333
lt's heading
for Deck 14, Section C-5.

32:53.404 --> 32:55.895
Okay, now l've got
a containment field blocking it.

32:57.075 --> 32:59.771
Whoa.
lt's changing direction.

32:59.844 --> 33:01.869
lt's like it's avoiding
the containment field.

33:02.013 --> 33:03.571
Let's give it another try.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.208
Now it's blocked on three sides.

33:06.284 --> 33:07.581
lt's changing course.

33:07.652 --> 33:08.846
Heading for the open side.

33:11.856 --> 33:14.086
Are you thinking
what l'm thinking?

33:14.158 --> 33:15.887
Those synaptic patterns...

33:15.960 --> 33:19.259
could be some sort
of neural net.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.924
We may be dealing
with a life-form.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.467
Bridge to Engineering.

33:23.534 --> 33:24.728
Torres here.

33:24.802 --> 33:27.771
We're detecting an energy mass
moving through the ship.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.501
Right. lt broke through
the sample container.

33:30.575 --> 33:33.976
Captain, it's showing
the properties of a life-form.

33:34.045 --> 33:36.513
A life-form?

33:36.581 --> 33:38.276
lt seems to have a neural net,

33:38.349 --> 33:40.874
and it's demonstrating
signs of intelligent behavior.

33:40.952 --> 33:42.579
lt's cutting it's way
through the ship.

33:42.653 --> 33:44.143
Heading for the outer hull.

33:44.222 --> 33:46.315
lt'll breach
in about 15 seconds.

33:46.391 --> 33:48.325
Are there any critical systems
in its path?

33:48.393 --> 33:49.325
Negative.

33:49.394 --> 33:50.520
Then let it go.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.893
Be ready to seal the hull breach
with a force field.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.990
l'll have a damage control team
standing by for repairs.

33:56.067 --> 33:58.160
And let's track it on sensors
when it gets out.

33:58.236 --> 34:00.534
Captain,
it's penetrating the outer hull.

34:00.638 --> 34:02.902
Force field is in place.

34:02.974 --> 34:06.410
l'm showing the energy form
100 meters off our port side.

34:06.477 --> 34:08.467
Let's get it on screen.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.844
What was that?

34:24.128 --> 34:27.120
lt appears to be some kind
of photonic lattice.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.393
And it seems pretty clear
that the energy form

34:29.467 --> 34:31.094
was trying to get back to it.

34:31.168 --> 34:34.696
As though it's...
a shelter of some kind.

34:34.772 --> 34:36.933
Or maybe
a transportation device--

34:37.074 --> 34:39.475
their equivalent of a ship.

34:39.543 --> 34:42.536
At any rate,
we had sensor contact

34:42.612 --> 34:45.172
for a few seconds,
and we picked up

34:45.248 --> 34:48.980
three distinct bioelectrical
patterns inside it.

34:49.053 --> 34:50.179
Bioelectrical?

34:50.254 --> 34:52.154
What are you suggesting,
Captain?

34:52.223 --> 34:54.315
We have three missing crewmen.

34:54.391 --> 34:55.984
Our best guess has been

34:56.094 --> 34:57.925
that they were somehow
converted into energy

34:57.995 --> 34:59.326
while they were on the holodeck.

34:59.397 --> 35:01.558
We find no sign of them
on this ship.

35:01.666 --> 35:05.261
Then we pick up three discrete
patterns in that lattice,

35:05.303 --> 35:07.965
three patterns that don't match
anything else in the lattice

35:08.039 --> 35:10.837
and which have
biological components.

35:10.908 --> 35:13.638
l don't think it's a stretch
to hypothesize

35:13.711 --> 35:15.110
that those are our crew members,

35:15.179 --> 35:18.808
converted into a kind
of photonic energy.

35:18.983 --> 35:20.917
But what are they
doing over there?

35:20.985 --> 35:22.452
How did they get there?

35:22.520 --> 35:23.919
We have good evidence now

35:23.988 --> 35:27.924
that there are photonic beings
that live in that protostar--

35:27.992 --> 35:30.358
life-forms
that have intelligence.

35:30.428 --> 35:31.656
We didn't know that

35:31.729 --> 35:34.129
when we beamed those
energy samples on board.

35:34.198 --> 35:36.325
We had no idea
that what we were doing,

35:36.400 --> 35:39.927
in essence, was capturing
those life-forms.

35:40.037 --> 35:42.130
We locked them
in a containment field,

35:42.206 --> 35:44.731
and began to experiment on them.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.970
lf my people were
taken like that...

35:48.746 --> 35:51.112
l know
what my response would be.

35:51.182 --> 35:54.310
l would do whatever was
necessary to get them back.

35:54.385 --> 35:56.478
Then you think
they have simply...

35:56.554 --> 35:57.953
retaliated against us?

35:58.022 --> 35:59.546
Yes.

35:59.624 --> 36:03.424
These beings can manifest
themselves on the holodeck

36:03.528 --> 36:05.553
in the matrix
of a holo-character.

36:05.596 --> 36:06.858
That's how they were able
to take

36:06.964 --> 36:09.125
our crew members hostage.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.758
Captain, if you're
right about this,

36:10.835 --> 36:13.395
then we should return
the remaining life-form.

36:13.471 --> 36:16.304
A gesture--
to show we mean well.

36:16.374 --> 36:17.864
lt's certainly worth a try.

36:17.975 --> 36:20.603
lf l took the life-form
onto the holodeck

36:20.678 --> 36:22.873
and release it to Grendel,

36:22.947 --> 36:25.279
maybe they'll understand
and release our people.

36:25.349 --> 36:28.443
Ordinarily, officers go
through intensive training

36:28.519 --> 36:29.645
before they're put

36:29.720 --> 36:32.280
into a First Contact
situation...

36:32.356 --> 36:35.587
but you're the only one
who can do this safely.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.924
l'd like to finish
what l started, Captain.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.326
l can do this.

36:39.397 --> 36:41.297
l agree.

36:41.365 --> 36:43.731
Make arrangements
to transfer the life-form

36:43.801 --> 36:47.134
to a container,
so the Doctor can carry it.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.131
But, remember...

36:51.209 --> 36:53.439
if you're holding the container,

36:53.511 --> 36:56.105
you'll have to stay
in solid form.

36:56.180 --> 36:58.978
l understand.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.085
Freya?

37:06.791 --> 37:08.019
Freya!

37:13.831 --> 37:15.992
Lord Schweitzer!

37:16.067 --> 37:18.968
We thought the Grendel
had taken you.

37:19.036 --> 37:21.231
Not... entirely.

37:21.305 --> 37:24.035
How did you survive?

37:24.108 --> 37:26.872
That would be difficult
to explain,

37:26.944 --> 37:30.243
but that's not
important right now.

37:30.314 --> 37:33.909
This is a talisman
to destroy Grendel...

37:34.018 --> 37:35.542
You lie!

37:35.620 --> 37:38.180
No man could survive
an encounter with Grendel

37:38.256 --> 37:40.724
unless he were
in league with the beast.

37:40.791 --> 37:44.625
You have brought that talisman
to destroy us all.

37:44.695 --> 37:45.627
That is not true.

37:45.696 --> 37:47.129
He has returned to help us.

37:47.198 --> 37:48.256
No!

37:48.332 --> 37:51.358
You speak his lies now.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.868
He has bewitched you.

37:52.937 --> 37:57.465
Unferth, l need to get
this talisman to the hall.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.202
Then that gives me reason enough

37:59.277 --> 38:02.178
to make sure
it never gets there.

38:10.655 --> 38:11.781
No! Please!

38:11.856 --> 38:13.790
You don't know
what you're doing.

38:27.171 --> 38:29.571
Prepare to die, demon.

38:40.017 --> 38:41.678
Freya...

38:45.623 --> 38:47.284
My Lord...

38:49.960 --> 38:51.723
my time has come.

38:51.796 --> 38:53.525
Freya, l'm sorry.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.692
There's nothing l can do.

38:57.768 --> 39:01.169
lt is a good death.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.405
Take my sword.

39:05.476 --> 39:08.707
Stop Unferth and Grendel.

39:10.648 --> 39:12.411
l won't forget you.

39:13.751 --> 39:16.413
Then l die happily...

39:16.487 --> 39:20.617
with your name on my lips.

39:20.691 --> 39:24.457
Farewell...

39:24.528 --> 39:26.655
Schweitzer.

39:50.821 --> 39:52.846
Here, Sire.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.120
My Lord...

39:59.196 --> 40:01.926
you know me as a true warrior.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.591
You know l am
the one hope you have

40:03.667 --> 40:05.134
to rid your kingdom of Grendel.

40:05.202 --> 40:08.296
That talisman will aid me
in my conquest.

40:08.372 --> 40:09.634
l must have it.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.402
Do not listen to him.

40:11.475 --> 40:14.467
He has already killed Freya.

40:32.863 --> 40:34.728
Stop him, my Lord!

40:34.799 --> 40:36.824
He is a madman!

40:36.901 --> 40:39.665
The only reason you won't die

40:39.737 --> 40:44.265
is that l've taken an oath
to do no harm.

41:02.326 --> 41:04.157
Grendel...

41:04.228 --> 41:05.593
l'm ready for you.

41:19.677 --> 41:22.612
l don't know if you
can understand me--

41:22.680 --> 41:24.978
but watch.

41:25.082 --> 41:27.141
l'm setting this one free.

41:37.361 --> 41:40.489
There's no need
for any more of this.

41:40.564 --> 41:42.589
Please...

41:42.666 --> 41:46.534
we ask you to return our crew.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.005
Captain, the photonic lattice
has reappeared.

41:55.112 --> 41:57.046
Scan it. All sensors.

41:57.147 --> 41:59.945
l'm reading a massive
particle surge on our holodeck.

42:00.017 --> 42:02.611
The lattice is gone again.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.950
Holodeck to Bridge.

42:05.022 --> 42:06.148
Go ahead, Doctor.

42:06.223 --> 42:07.349
What is it?

42:07.424 --> 42:09.289
We have them back, Captain--

42:09.360 --> 42:11.021
all three of them.

42:11.095 --> 42:12.756
Good work, Doctor.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.092
Yeah. Good work.

42:14.164 --> 42:17.895
Would you mind
telling me where l was?

42:17.968 --> 42:22.735
Captain's Log, Stardate 487 10.5.

42:22.806 --> 42:24.831
Since the return
of our missing crewmen,

42:24.909 --> 42:26.137
we've been unable to locate

42:26.210 --> 42:29.202
any further traces
of the photonic aliens.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.269
l don't know if the being

42:30.347 --> 42:33.805
understood language
or just my behavior.

42:33.884 --> 42:36.409
lt would have been
interesting to pursue

42:36.487 --> 42:37.954
the relationship further.

42:38.022 --> 42:40.752
lt's one of the most exciting
aspects of space exploration--

42:40.824 --> 42:44.282
meeting new species,
establishing communication,

42:44.361 --> 42:47.125
sharing differences
and similarities.

42:47.197 --> 42:49.358
l'm sorry none of that
happened this time.

42:49.433 --> 42:51.094
But it did.

42:51.168 --> 42:54.001
lt just didn't happen
in very predictable ways.

42:54.071 --> 42:56.665
But if you think about it,

42:56.740 --> 43:00.073
we entered into conflict,
communicated,

43:00.144 --> 43:03.409
and eventually established
a peace treaty with them.

43:06.383 --> 43:09.648
l'm placing a special
commendation in the logs.

43:09.720 --> 43:12.917
For exemplary performance
by the Chief Medical Officer

43:13.023 --> 43:15.514
during his first away mission.

43:19.797 --> 43:21.094
Thank you.

43:21.165 --> 43:23.725
l'd like to cite you by name.

43:23.801 --> 43:26.201
Kes tells me you've chosen one.

43:26.270 --> 43:27.669
ls that true?

43:27.738 --> 43:29.137
l had...

43:29.206 --> 43:31.401
but l'm not sure
l want to keep it.

43:31.475 --> 43:34.035
The last time l heard
that name spoken

43:34.111 --> 43:36.773
was a... painful one.

43:36.847 --> 43:38.940
l don't think
l want to be reminded.

43:39.049 --> 43:40.846
Sounds like you had
quite an adventure

43:40.918 --> 43:43.284
on that holodeck, Doctor.

43:43.354 --> 43:45.948
Yes, l would say so.

43:46.991 --> 43:48.618
Well...

43:48.692 --> 43:53.789
something tells me
you haven't had your last one.

43:59.436 --> 44:01.904
Something tells me
the same thing.
