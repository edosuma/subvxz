The following
presentation is rated 18A.

00:08.921 --> 00:11.401
This presentation deals
with mature subject matter

00:11.402 --> 00:13.577
and contains scenes
with coarse language,

00:13.578 --> 00:16.580
nudity, sexuality, and violence.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.801
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.288
We got 16 dead,
triple that in injuries.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.378
- Somebody lost control.
- He didn't lose control.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.818
Tell me, Detective, did you
catch all the bad guys?

00:35.948 --> 00:37.230
- And here we go.
- Brady Hartsfield.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.387
- That's right.
- Do you know where he is?

00:39.517 --> 00:40.301
Maybe you got
the wrong ice cream man.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.868
Brady Hartsfield
wouldn't hurt a fly.

00:42.999 --> 00:43.347
Yeah, well,
it's possible he would.

00:43.478 --> 00:44.087
It's not the guy.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.741
I'm gonna make my dent.

00:45.871 --> 00:46.991
This will be my masterpiece.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.135
Brady? Whoa, whoa, wait!

00:52.313 --> 00:53.662
Everybody down!

00:53.792 --> 00:55.403
Freeze!

00:58.449 --> 01:01.278
- Tony Montez.
- I run the DA's homicide unit.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.647
Am I gonna be able to prosecute
Brady Hartsfield?

01:02.671 --> 01:04.063
Not at this juncture.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.674
Thought any more about school?

01:05.804 --> 01:07.763
- You going back?
- What if I want this life?

01:07.893 --> 01:10.505
That's fine. Be part of it
with a Harvard degree.

01:10.635 --> 01:11.462
You know anything
about the Cerebellin trials

01:11.593 --> 01:13.160
they've been running
in western China?

01:13.290 --> 01:14.117
Why are you telling me this?

01:14.248 --> 01:15.336
Because we need someone

01:15.466 --> 01:18.339
as brilliant as you to test it.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.143
The fucking Mercedes Killer
is out there.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.187
Do you want to explain
how he can walk

01:21.211 --> 01:22.865
after laying vegetative
for over a year?

01:22.995 --> 01:24.823
What did you do to me?

01:24.954 --> 01:25.974
The drug you're on
is called Cerebellin.

01:25.998 --> 01:27.678
You'll need another dose
within three days.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.219
- Or?
- You'll die.

01:29.350 --> 01:32.440
Look, uh, Lou,
you might not be safe here.

01:32.570 --> 01:33.354
You think he's gonna
come looking for me?

01:33.484 --> 01:34.006
Guys, look.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.487
Walked in voluntarily

01:36.618 --> 01:37.358
and surrendered himself
without incident.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.447
What?

01:39.577 --> 01:41.666
Brady Hartsfield has been cured.

01:41.797 --> 01:44.234
There was the man who committed
this atrocious crime,

01:44.365 --> 01:45.844
and then there's
Brady Hartsfield

01:45.975 --> 01:48.891
sitting here with us today.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.541
- Now what?
- They want him transferred

01:50.588 --> 01:52.044
to Springfield, Missouri, so he
can continue to be studied.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.591
Before trial?

01:53.722 --> 01:56.116
Are you saying that he
actually might get off?

01:56.246 --> 01:57.310
I'm saying that he may avoid

01:57.334 --> 01:58.614
having to go to trial
altogether.

01:59.945 --> 02:02.470
I do not forgive you.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.906
I do not.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.808 --> 02:37.548
I'm having second thoughts.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.028
Then don't think.

02:41.726 --> 02:44.294
And maybe don't talk...
so I can concentrate.

02:50.082 --> 02:51.451
You know for a fact
he's got money?

02:51.475 --> 02:53.390
You know this
for an absolute fact?

02:53.521 --> 02:55.151
What I know for a fact
is that he hates banks

02:55.175 --> 02:55.784
and he's made
a shitload of dough.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.178
He's got it stashed.

02:58.308 --> 02:59.459
Just saying, a crazy-ass recluse

02:59.483 --> 03:01.268
living out in the woods
and shit?

03:01.398 --> 03:03.202
He figures to have weapons,
maybe a dog or two.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.880
Watch out!

03:05.010 --> 03:06.838
That there was an omen.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.666
That's what that was.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.277
A sudden obstacle in our path.

03:10.407 --> 03:14.498
- Carl...
- It's just a bad idea, Morris.

03:14.629 --> 03:17.153
I know it in my bones.

03:17.284 --> 03:20.635
Stealing cars and shit,
I can do.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.551
- Breaking into homes...
- This man is 86 years old!

03:23.681 --> 03:25.466
He's frail.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.676
At 2:30 in the morning,
he also figures to be asleep.

03:27.772 --> 03:28.425
You just need to relax, buddy.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.079
Breathe.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.995
One more.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.917
There it is. There it is.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.286
There's the turnoff
to his house.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.573
Kill your lights.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.303
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

03:50.578 --> 03:51.818
I just have this bad feeling.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.059
Look at me.

03:56.279 --> 03:59.108
Even in failure,
you're about to meet

03:59.239 --> 04:01.502
the greatest American author
that ever lived.

04:01.632 --> 04:04.113
Okay, masks on.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.680
Once we go, we go fast...
Very fast.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.508
Forgive me, Father.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.727
It's been three months
since my last confession.

04:09.858 --> 04:10.728
What are you doing?

04:10.859 --> 04:12.252
I'm confessing my sins

04:12.382 --> 04:14.341
just in case something
happens in there

04:14.471 --> 04:15.492
and we don't get to later.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.387
Would you put
your fucking mask on?

04:20.129 --> 04:22.174
- Can I just say one thing?
- I wish you wouldn't.

04:22.305 --> 04:25.917
Four or so years ago,
the night we met,

04:26.048 --> 04:27.852
the night we somehow didn't get
squished like everybody else

04:27.876 --> 04:29.138
at that job fair,

04:29.269 --> 04:31.706
we looked each other
in the eye and we agreed.

04:31.836 --> 04:32.968
God spared us.

04:33.098 --> 04:35.362
He spared us for a reason,

04:35.492 --> 04:36.948
and I don't think it was
to break into some guy's house

04:36.972 --> 04:39.322
and rob him.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.890
The reason we were
in that job fair to begin with

04:42.020 --> 04:43.195
is, we were godforsaken.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.459
Four years later, we still are.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.463
You want to pray on something?
Pray on this.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.735
God helps those
who help themselves.

04:55.991 --> 04:56.991
Let's move.

06:30.564 --> 06:31.913
There he is.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.016
Mr. Rothstein.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.281
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.544
Get the fucking light off,
would ya?

06:57.373 --> 06:58.461
What's going on?

06:58.592 --> 07:00.550
Huh?

07:02.073 --> 07:04.641
First, I am a huge fan.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.559
And second, I will kill you
if necessary.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.866
And third, who the fuck are you?

07:11.996 --> 07:13.302
That's not important.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.478
- It's not important?
- You got a name?

07:15.609 --> 07:18.525
Oh, bullshit,
everybody's got a fucking name.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.285
I mean, what'll they put
on your tombstone?

07:20.309 --> 07:23.617
'Cause right now,
all it says is,

07:23.747 --> 07:27.011
"This is the dumbest shit
that ever fucking lived."

07:27.142 --> 07:28.709
Take me to your safe.

07:28.839 --> 07:31.755
Oh, fuck off.

07:31.886 --> 07:37.892
I will... kill you.

07:38.022 --> 07:40.329
This is the moment
where your plan gets fucked.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.246
I suspect it was faulty
from the very beginning,

07:44.376 --> 07:47.554
but I've had a grand life.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.556
I mean, I lectured
at universities,

07:49.686 --> 07:50.382
won a Pulitzer.

07:50.513 --> 07:56.432
I even... Fucked Marilyn Monroe.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.826
How about that?

07:58.956 --> 08:01.393
Now, when's the last time
you and the other little turd

08:01.524 --> 08:02.786
did anything like that?

08:02.917 --> 08:05.397
- Mr. Rothstein...
- Look, I'm not finished.

08:05.528 --> 08:08.226
You know what I don't have?

08:08.357 --> 08:09.576
I don't have a proper ending.

08:11.752 --> 08:15.364
I mean, living in the woods,
languishing in arts.

08:16.800 --> 08:21.675
But being murdered,
now, that's something.

08:21.805 --> 08:25.592
You think I leave my door
unlocked by mistake?

08:25.722 --> 08:30.161
I've been waiting for this
fucking moment my entire life.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.467
Pull it, pussy.

08:32.599 --> 08:33.879
Have a little courage.
That's it!

08:36.907 --> 08:39.431
- You know what?
- I am going to shoot you.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.085
But not to give you
your special,

08:41.216 --> 08:43.957
magical storybook ending.

08:44.087 --> 08:46.128
No, I'm gonna shoot you
for being a total hypocrite.

08:47.222 --> 08:49.006
You fear going out small.

08:50.704 --> 08:53.228
What about what you did
to Jimmy Gold?

08:53.358 --> 08:55.447
For Christ's sake.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.928
He goes into advertising?

08:58.059 --> 08:59.059
Advertising?

09:01.453 --> 09:02.953
House in the suburbs,
wife and two kids.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.737
One of the greatest characters
in American literature,

09:04.761 --> 09:09.549
and you...
you shit all over him.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.377
Well, if you believe that,

09:12.508 --> 09:16.338
then you never understood
a fucking word I wrote.

09:17.992 --> 09:18.993
Pull it.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.168
Pull it, pussy!

09:22.474 --> 09:25.303
Oh, why so afraid?

09:25.434 --> 09:26.478
Huh?

09:26.609 --> 09:28.480
Isn't this your happy ending?

09:30.134 --> 09:32.789
Bullshit.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.878
You are afraid to die,
just like the rest of us.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.881
Only let me tell you,

09:38.012 --> 09:40.797
you've already died small,

09:40.928 --> 09:43.800
hiding out from the world
like a rat in a hole,

09:43.931 --> 09:47.151
and you made Jimmy small.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.326
I found the safe!

09:49.893 --> 09:52.156
Okay, Mr. Rothstein,

09:52.287 --> 09:53.070
you are gonna give us
the combination.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.724
We are gonna leave you alive,

09:54.855 --> 09:56.441
and then you'll be free
to call the police

09:56.465 --> 09:57.771
and say, "I've been robbed."

09:57.901 --> 09:59.294
That'll make you relevant again.

09:59.424 --> 10:00.750
I found the combination
on the wall!

10:00.774 --> 10:02.253
Open it!

10:02.384 --> 10:04.255
Maybe this'll be
your final epitaph:

10:04.386 --> 10:06.736
"Too senile to remember

10:06.867 --> 10:08.999
the combination
to his own safe."

10:09.130 --> 10:10.566
Do me a favor.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.613
Take your mask off, please.

10:16.093 --> 10:19.444
I want to look into the eyes
of the guy who's gonna kill me.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.884
- Jimmy Gold said that...
- in "Street Runner."

10:24.014 --> 10:26.054
Oh, go fuck yourself,
and take Jimmy Gold with ya.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.586
Oh, fuck.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.067
Holy shit! Oh, my fucking God!

10:33.197 --> 10:34.503
These are 50s and $100 bills!

10:34.634 --> 10:35.896
Well, good luck spending them.

10:36.026 --> 10:39.377
- They're all marked, asshole.
- Right.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.148
How would you spend it
if it's all marked?

10:45.079 --> 10:47.385
What is this? Manuscripts?

10:47.516 --> 10:49.387
No, no, those are
just scribblings, man!

10:49.518 --> 10:52.782
They're rantings,
an old man ranting away.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.433
- This is a manuscript.
- I take notes!

10:55.132 --> 10:57.874
- Jimmy Gold.
- Huh?

10:58.005 --> 10:58.788
There's more Jimmy Gold?

10:58.919 --> 11:01.486
Take the money

11:01.617 --> 11:03.880
and get the fuck out of here.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.013
Those things are worthless.

11:06.143 --> 11:06.753
You think they're worthless?

11:06.883 --> 11:08.363
I care to disagree, my friend.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.757
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.628
You might as well
try and sell a Hemingway

11:12.759 --> 11:14.325
or a Picasso, for Christ's sake.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.893
There's no money
in that for you.

11:17.024 --> 11:17.851
Is that what you think?

11:17.981 --> 11:21.245
This is millions
and millions of dollars.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.376
Shit!

11:30.254 --> 11:32.996
No.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.876
No, no, no. No!

11:45.008 --> 11:46.008
Oh!

11:50.318 --> 11:51.623
Oh, God.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.889
No, no, no, no! Shit!

11:56.019 --> 11:57.717
God! God!

11:57.847 --> 12:00.023
Oh, fuck.

12:26.833 --> 12:27.834
Oh, Jesus.

12:31.707 --> 12:32.752
Carl?

12:35.972 --> 12:36.972
Fuck.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.020
Fuck! Fuck!

12:40.150 --> 12:42.152
You stupid bastard.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.074
Come here. Come here.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.033
Come here.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.258
Oh, Jesus.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.261
Fuck.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.004
Fuck.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.105
Holy shit.

13:22.236 --> 13:24.804
Okay, okay, okay.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.720
Oh, my fucking God.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.161
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.119
Oh, my God.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.316
He gave me no choice.

13:59.447 --> 14:02.929
He gave me no choice! Fuck!

14:05.845 --> 14:08.108
Oh, shit!

14:10.197 --> 14:11.633
Oh!

14:53.936 --> 14:56.417
Crowd: Let Lou go! Let Lou go!

14:56.547 --> 14:59.072
Let Lou go!

15:02.118 --> 15:04.053
Detective Hodges, can I get
your reaction to the case?

15:04.077 --> 15:05.817
You may not.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.828
A big day for the woman
who shot Mr. Mercedes.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.821
A big day for the city
of Bridgton

15:09.952 --> 15:11.954
and, I suspect, a big day
for you as well.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.696
- We're up to speed, then.
- Lot of big days.

15:14.826 --> 15:18.613
Crowd: Let Lou go! Let Lou go!

15:18.743 --> 15:20.049
Mr. Hodges, nice to see ya.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.573
How's she doing?

15:22.704 --> 15:25.185
Good days, bad days.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.100
I'm meeting with her
right after.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.382
Gotta warn ya, they may not
let her have other visitors,

15:29.406 --> 15:31.321
which might be for the best.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.236
Well, why not? It's only me.

15:33.367 --> 15:36.239
She's emotionally fragile.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.981
I need her constitution
to be solid going into trial.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.703
You said this would never
get to trial.

15:45.727 --> 15:48.730
- We drew a tough DA.
- What can I say?

15:48.860 --> 15:50.601
I'm still hoping
we'll reach a deal,

15:50.732 --> 15:53.517
but I have to get ready
for trial.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.389
Gotta prepare for the fight.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.959
You don't sound
too upset about it.

15:58.522 --> 15:59.915
We should probably get up there.

16:03.745 --> 16:06.661
Case number 62324,

16:06.791 --> 16:08.968
People of Ohio
vs. Lou Linklatter.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.603
Okay, there'll be
no talking in here.

16:16.627 --> 16:17.759
No talking.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.630
Could you call the office

16:19.761 --> 16:22.024
- and let them know...
- No whispering either.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.113
And if I see a cell phone
come out,

16:24.244 --> 16:26.768
oh, my God.

16:26.898 --> 16:32.600
Okay, I-I have counsels'
pretrial statements.

16:32.730 --> 16:35.168
I have a witness list.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.518
I got the exhibit list.

16:37.648 --> 16:40.129
It's what I-I-I don't have
that worries me.

16:41.435 --> 16:42.435
Where's the meat, people?

16:45.352 --> 16:47.354
You know, any outstanding
motions for the court?

16:47.484 --> 16:48.485
No, Your Honor.

16:52.707 --> 16:55.318
No, Your Honor.

16:55.449 --> 16:58.104
- Amendments to pleadings?
- None from the People of Ohio.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.234
Nor the defendant.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.284
Affirmative defenses?

17:04.414 --> 17:06.982
None, Your Honor.

17:08.592 --> 17:09.637
I'm not satisfied!

17:12.770 --> 17:14.511
I'll see counsel in my chambers.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.645
I'll be right back.

17:17.775 --> 17:18.775
What am I supposed to do?

17:19.299 --> 17:21.040
Come on! Today!

17:28.656 --> 17:32.964
- What the fuck is this?
- I'm sorry?

17:33.095 --> 17:34.333
You seriously think
you're gonna get

17:34.357 --> 17:36.794
a murder one convict?

17:36.925 --> 17:38.535
She's a folk hero,
for God's sake.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.711
She could fucking run
for office.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.757
And maybe get elected.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.604
Doesn't mean she gets
to shoot people in the head.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.650
The facts support murder one,
so that's what I'm charging.

17:46.674 --> 17:47.892
Mm-hmm.

17:49.590 --> 17:52.288
And you? Hmm?

17:52.419 --> 17:53.681
Why not insanity?

17:53.811 --> 17:56.336
My client is not insane,
was not insane.

17:56.466 --> 17:59.904
If anything, she acted out
in a burst of extreme clarity.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.603
So this is how
it's gonna be, huh?

18:02.733 --> 18:04.561
Dump all this shit on me?

18:04.692 --> 18:07.695
Make me the chump
who convicted the hero

18:07.825 --> 18:09.958
or set the killer free, huh?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.787
Heavy is the head that wears
the crown, Your Honor.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.876
Oh, shut the fuck up!

18:17.966 --> 18:20.186
You two...

18:20.316 --> 18:23.232
are messing
with the wrong donkey.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.930
I'll tell you,
better plead this thing out

18:26.061 --> 18:28.803
like God and the good
People of Ohio want you to.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.159
Whoa. Whoa.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.030
You fucks.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.945
Okay.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.600
Okay.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.341
Murder two.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.734
Eight years.

18:46.864 --> 18:47.885
It was an assassination.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.650
I won't go
for murder two either.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.000
Well, what's it gonna take?

18:52.131 --> 18:52.479
- Five years.
- Credit for time served.

18:52.609 --> 18:53.609
Not a chance.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.134
It was premeditated murder.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.264
I'm not satisfied.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.270
Maybe you should
recuse yourself.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.074
- On what grounds?
- On the grounds it seems

19:03.098 --> 19:04.447
you have a giant bug up your ass

19:04.578 --> 19:05.448
and we should safeguard
your intestinal well-being.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.884
Did you just say that to me?

19:07.015 --> 19:08.147
Huh?

19:09.757 --> 19:12.803
Oh, I am not satisfied.

20:49.683 --> 20:50.683
Oh!

20:54.601 --> 20:55.601
Fuck!

21:11.357 --> 21:13.228
Damn it. Okay.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.407
Fuck!

21:24.283 --> 21:25.283
Fuck!

21:51.614 --> 21:52.852
So what are we gonna do
about Big Bernie?

21:52.876 --> 21:54.269
He's not our problem.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.881
The DA, however, is as talented
as she is principled,

21:58.012 --> 22:00.144
and she's obviously not budging.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.931
So... What does all this mean?

22:06.890 --> 22:08.196
It means you're going to trial.

22:09.719 --> 22:11.417
Hang on a second.

22:11.547 --> 22:12.785
She can't go to trial.
She'll get convicted.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.029
Nobody knows
what a jury will do.

22:15.159 --> 22:18.249
Look, if you want
to argue insanity,

22:18.380 --> 22:22.428
I need to enter it now
as an affirmative defense.

22:22.558 --> 22:23.622
- Well, why don't you, then?
- I mean, what else do you got?

22:23.646 --> 22:24.908
Do you mind?

22:25.039 --> 22:27.084
The problem with insanity is,

22:27.215 --> 22:29.130
in victory,
she's institutionalized,

22:29.260 --> 22:29.913
maybe for the rest of her life.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.437
Well, temporary insanity.

22:31.567 --> 22:32.567
There's no such thing.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.181
We'd lose with diminished
capacity, my opinion.

22:37.312 --> 22:40.750
You methodically planned it
and carried it out

22:40.881 --> 22:43.318
with an efficiency
government could only envy.

22:43.449 --> 22:46.843
We can't win if we insult
the jury's intelligence.

22:46.974 --> 22:49.803
The best argument
is that Brady Hartsfield

22:49.933 --> 22:51.195
deserved to be dead.

22:51.326 --> 22:54.721
It's less a legal theory
than a populist appeal.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.247
- Can that work?
- No.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.077
- Potentially, yes.
- Depends on Big Bernie.

23:03.207 --> 23:05.601
If he strongly instructs
the jury to follow the law...

23:05.732 --> 23:07.124
Then I'm fucked.

23:07.255 --> 23:10.998
- But...
- he also sees you as a hero.

23:11.128 --> 23:14.001
He said as much in chambers.

23:14.131 --> 23:15.771
And he hates the DA
more than he hates me.

23:17.831 --> 23:18.919
What about self-defense

23:19.049 --> 23:21.051
or defense of others?

23:21.182 --> 23:25.055
- The victim was unarmed.
- So what?

23:25.186 --> 23:27.033
Brady Hartsfield was still
capable of killing people

23:27.057 --> 23:28.450
while he was in a coma.

23:28.581 --> 23:29.973
It stands to reason

23:30.104 --> 23:31.584
that he'd be able
to keep killing them

23:31.714 --> 23:34.064
while he was in prison as well.

23:34.195 --> 23:36.155
Doesn't stand to reason
with the People of Ohio.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.461
But I like it.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.768
He was inhabiting people,
for fuck's sake.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.378
He was no less of a menace
in prison.

23:43.509 --> 23:47.034
Again, that's a lot
for Ohio folks to bite off.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.786
I need to think about it.

24:01.701 --> 24:04.704
Basically both sides
are playing poker.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.358
The DA is betting that
they won't set her scot-free.

24:07.489 --> 24:10.492
Finkelstein is thinking
they won't send her to prison.

24:10.623 --> 24:11.623
Well, is he right?

24:12.581 --> 24:14.757
He might be.

24:14.888 --> 24:15.671
Or he might just believe
his own bullshit

24:15.802 --> 24:17.238
and think he can win.

24:18.021 --> 24:20.154
DA is even worse...

24:20.284 --> 24:23.026
got a stick up her hole
the size of a cannon barrel.

24:23.157 --> 24:25.028
Okay, that will cost you $10.

24:26.595 --> 24:27.595
For what?

24:27.683 --> 24:29.729
Oh, you know very well.

24:32.209 --> 24:33.950
"Stick" isn't a bad word.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.081
Neither is "hole."

24:36.387 --> 24:37.669
I'm not throwing money
into your "fuck" jar

24:37.693 --> 24:38.955
every time I have an opinion.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.106
No, it's not about opinions.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.871
It's about decency, okay?

24:42.002 --> 24:44.004
This is a reputable place
of business,

24:44.134 --> 24:47.834
and we will not have
our founder waxing on about

24:47.964 --> 24:51.228
sticks the size of cannons
being shoved up a woman's...

24:53.230 --> 24:54.405
Orifice.

24:54.536 --> 24:54.928
Orifice.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.278
$10.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.937
Fuck me up the ass.

25:04.067 --> 25:05.416
And I'm not paying for that.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.768
I got dominion
over my own orifice.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.158
- Jesus balls.
- Thank you.

25:14.861 --> 25:17.254
Just the man I'm looking for.

25:17.385 --> 25:19.518
- Yeah, I missed you too.
- How we doing?

25:19.648 --> 25:20.886
- Good, everything's been...
- Rhetorical.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.042
- Oh.
- Your office.

25:28.701 --> 25:31.399
Before anything else,

25:31.530 --> 25:33.053
we need to discuss
Lou Linklatter.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.317
Why are you coming down hard
on her?

25:36.447 --> 25:38.007
My office does not
have it in for Lou.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.741
We'd sooner throw a parade
than prosecute.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.148
Well, then what the fuck?

25:41.278 --> 25:45.239
Sarah Pace, the ADA,
she's on a bit of a mission.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.023
You can't get her
to soften up, no?

25:47.154 --> 25:49.591
Reduce the charges
to manslaughter.

25:51.288 --> 25:53.769
I'm sorry, but manslaughter
is a mockery.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.573
That was beyond premeditated.
She planned it.

25:55.597 --> 25:56.990
She printed out
a fucking 3-D gun.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.645
This was textbook
malice aforethought.

25:59.775 --> 26:00.646
She did society a fucking favor.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.213
- Bill...
- Not to mention

26:03.344 --> 26:04.867
it was you and me
who wound her up.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.827
We convinced Lou
to meet with Brady,

26:07.957 --> 26:09.108
to give testimony against him...

26:09.132 --> 26:10.960
We did not suggest
that she kill him.

26:11.091 --> 26:12.571
You know where I'm going
with this.

26:12.701 --> 26:15.399
We took a young woman

26:15.530 --> 26:17.576
in a fragile
psychological state,

26:17.706 --> 26:20.361
we put her into a situation,
and then shit happened.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.450
That shit's on us.

26:25.932 --> 26:28.238
Agreed. I'll talk to Sarah.

26:28.891 --> 26:31.851
Thank you.

26:31.981 --> 26:36.638
- Now...
- for the reason that I'm here.

26:36.769 --> 26:37.944
Aye.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.434
You ever heard
of John Rothstein?

26:43.079 --> 26:44.777
Is this a joke?

26:44.907 --> 26:47.040
Who hasn't heard of him,
especially in this town?

26:47.170 --> 26:47.344
Yeah, well, he was murdered
last night.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.346
What?

26:49.477 --> 26:52.219
Yeah, a home invasion
gone to shit,

26:52.349 --> 26:53.568
multiple intruders, we think.

26:53.699 --> 26:54.937
Rothstein even killed
one of them.

26:54.961 --> 26:55.961
He's dead?

26:57.137 --> 26:57.877
- Rothstein?
- Yeah.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.087
They don't come any deader.

27:08.017 --> 27:09.845
Are you... are you okay?

27:09.976 --> 27:10.411
Shit, did you know him
or something?

27:10.541 --> 27:10.846
Was he a friend of yours?

27:10.977 --> 27:12.456
In a way.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.915
I read every word
that man wrote.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.683
Oh, so what is this, like...

27:21.814 --> 27:22.814
like, fan grief?

27:27.689 --> 27:29.386
Bill, are you okay?

27:29.517 --> 27:31.127
No.

27:35.088 --> 27:36.088
I'm sorry.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.396
Anyway, obviously
when this thing breaks,

27:39.527 --> 27:42.922
which will be shortly,
a lot of shit is gonna fly.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.621
And there's gonna be
a lot of pressure

27:46.752 --> 27:48.188
to catch whoever did this.

27:48.318 --> 27:49.580
And given the victim,

27:49.711 --> 27:53.410
I'm expecting some bigfooting
from the FBI.

27:53.541 --> 27:56.631
Some U.S. attorney jack-off
is gonna cherry-pick this case

27:56.762 --> 27:58.633
to make a name for himself,
so it's important

27:58.764 --> 28:00.330
that the local police
make this arrest

28:00.461 --> 28:02.341
and I prosecute so I can make
a name for myself.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.247
And I would be a household name

28:04.378 --> 28:06.182
if I got the chance
to prosecute Brady Hartsfield,

28:06.206 --> 28:08.208
which I didn't
because of your girl Lou.

28:08.338 --> 28:10.471
So this here is my new
career lottery ticket.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.429
All about the justice.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.913
Look, there's gonna be
a lot of gossip

28:18.044 --> 28:20.307
flying above and below
the radar on Rothstein,

28:20.437 --> 28:23.223
given the personality
that he was.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.878
Look, if you hear anything
at the bar, at the church,

28:26.008 --> 28:27.072
at your fucking goat yoga class,

28:27.096 --> 28:28.924
do me a favor: Let me know.

28:29.055 --> 28:30.360
I'll talk to Sarah Pace.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.686
You keep me
in the grapevine loop.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.407
Okay?

28:36.366 --> 28:38.194
Shit, you look like
you're gonna fucking puke.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.579
Holy shit.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.407
- Oh, God.
- Hang on.

30:00.537 --> 30:01.645
All right, hold on, brother.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.714
We're gonna get you some help,
all right?

30:03.845 --> 30:05.499
Don't you die on me.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.549
- Don't you die on me. Come on.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

30:07.675 --> 30:08.675
Come on, come on.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.258
Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?

30:28.043 --> 30:28.739
On her way to work.

30:28.870 --> 30:32.178
Why aren't you in school?

30:32.308 --> 30:33.962
We got teacher conference day.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.990
I got to go later, though,
meet with my college adviser.

30:42.928 --> 30:43.928
You doing okay?

30:47.149 --> 30:49.195
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

30:50.979 --> 30:52.589
Mm.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.940
Do me a favor: Take the dog out.

30:55.070 --> 30:56.550
I don't know if your mother did,

30:56.680 --> 30:58.640
and I don't need him shitting
on the carpet again.

31:03.383 --> 31:04.645
Okay, come on, Boogers.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.179
Why is he doing that?

31:17.310 --> 31:19.094
Well, he's clearly upset.

31:19.225 --> 31:22.315
But why?

31:22.445 --> 31:24.405
Evidently John Rothstein
was his favorite author

31:24.534 --> 31:25.534
on the planet.

31:28.408 --> 31:31.498
He seems to be
taking it personally.

31:31.628 --> 31:33.693
Yeah, well, Irish people
get that way about authors.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.632
It's a thing.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.843
I heard once that Colin Farrell
screams "James Joyce"

31:37.896 --> 31:40.202
when he orgasms.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.774
Holly, that's at least
20 bucks in the jar.

31:48.341 --> 31:51.692
- S-sorry.
- At least.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.975
Boogers!

32:14.106 --> 32:15.455
Here, pup.

32:21.504 --> 32:22.810
Boogers!

32:26.640 --> 32:27.840
Here, buddy. Come on, Boogers.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.078
Boogers!

32:39.000 --> 32:40.697
Come on. Stay.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.879
Boogers, here. Stay.

32:49.010 --> 32:50.010
Sit.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.931
Oh, shit.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.635
Lee?

34:33.897 --> 34:37.335
Lee? Lee?

34:37.466 --> 34:39.120
- It's Michael Lee.
- It's Michael Lee.

34:40.339 --> 34:41.643
Michael Lee?

34:46.780 --> 34:49.130
Michael Lee? Is...

34:49.956 --> 34:53.612
Yes. Yes.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.092
Sorry.

34:55.223 --> 34:57.660
Do you know what happened?

35:01.229 --> 35:02.578
I was hitchhiking.

35:04.624 --> 35:06.539
Last thing I remember
was high beams.

35:06.669 --> 35:08.715
Okay. Oh, no, no. Rest.

35:08.845 --> 35:09.629
Rest, Mr. Lee.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.674
Okay, you have
a few bruised ribs,

35:11.805 --> 35:13.894
a dislocated shoulder,
which we reset.

35:14.024 --> 35:16.984
But no internal bleeding.
Organs are good.

35:17.115 --> 35:17.985
- Okay?
- When can I get out?

35:18.116 --> 35:19.856
- No rush.
- You need to let yourself heal.

35:19.987 --> 35:21.075
Okay?

35:21.206 --> 35:22.511
How did I get here?

35:24.687 --> 35:26.820
Either a Good Samaritan
or a guardian angel.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.822
I imagine it's a combination
of both.

35:30.911 --> 35:32.802
Someone found you on the road
and brought you in.

35:32.826 --> 35:34.523
If they hadn't...

37:32.206 --> 37:35.470
Well... it is sort of like
a death in the family.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.300
He was foundational
for you, Bill.

37:39.431 --> 37:42.172
He was for a lot of people.
That's what made him Rothstein.

37:45.654 --> 37:48.266
I'm thinking you must have
started reading him

37:48.396 --> 37:49.636
when you were a very young man.

37:50.703 --> 37:52.835
- Yeah 15, 16.
- Hmm.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.291
He's kind of the reason
I came to Bridgton

37:54.315 --> 37:56.752
in the first place
all those years ago.

37:56.883 --> 37:58.580
Are you serious?

37:59.755 --> 38:02.758
Yeah.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.562
Kind of wanted to start off
in his America.

38:04.586 --> 38:07.763
You know what I mean? Felt real.

38:10.244 --> 38:12.364
Certainly had no other reason
to come to fucking Ohio.

38:14.857 --> 38:15.423
I met him once, you know.

38:15.554 --> 38:18.600
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:18.731 --> 38:20.472
Just after I became
a police officer.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.648
Disorderly conduct.

38:22.778 --> 38:26.042
He was beyond pissed in a bar,
carrying on...

38:26.173 --> 38:28.523
told me to go fuck myself.

38:28.654 --> 38:30.525
Well,
that sounds like Rothstein.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.614
Yeah, it was an honor.

38:34.268 --> 38:36.268
But I was always sure
I'd meet him again, you know?

38:37.880 --> 38:38.968
Let me show you something.

38:41.231 --> 38:45.453
The day I retired...
he dropped me a note.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.370
John Rothstein
dropped you a note?

38:51.241 --> 38:52.401
I nearly fell off my chair.

38:57.247 --> 38:59.337
"You were a fucking hack."

39:01.382 --> 39:02.252
And you framed it.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.124
Well, he signed it.

39:04.254 --> 39:05.778
It's got to be worth something.

39:05.908 --> 39:07.910
- Probably a lot.
- Yeah, yeah.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.540
But the fact that he
remembered me or whatever...

39:09.564 --> 39:12.045
Jesus Christ, look at that.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.264
No price on that.

39:14.395 --> 39:18.660
Old goat, failing health...

39:18.791 --> 39:20.532
I mean, I figured
he was half gone.

39:22.011 --> 39:25.841
But gone, gone...

39:28.670 --> 39:30.629
It's just like a punch
in the gut.

39:32.935 --> 39:36.635
Back when JFK died,
I cried for days.

39:38.288 --> 39:39.288
Wept.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.381
It wasn't that I cared
for his politics so much.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.034
It was just the poetry
of his soul.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.690
It left a hole in all of us.

39:48.821 --> 39:51.040
Mm.

39:51.171 --> 39:54.392
Rothstein...
there will never be another.

39:57.090 --> 39:58.490
You're not the only one
in mourning.

40:01.703 --> 40:03.357
I want to get the man
who killed him.

40:06.491 --> 40:08.144
Best leave that
to the police, Bill.

40:08.275 --> 40:09.755
Maybe.

40:10.973 --> 40:12.105
Maybe not.

40:14.716 --> 40:15.716
Don't be ridiculous.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.552
Oh, my fucking God.

40:28.469 --> 40:30.036
How was school?

40:30.166 --> 40:31.516
It was okay.

40:33.300 --> 40:34.300
Nobody got shot.

40:35.737 --> 40:38.218
That supposed to be a joke?

40:38.348 --> 40:39.828
I didn't mean it as a joke.

40:39.959 --> 40:41.679
People get shot at school now.
It's a thing.

40:43.876 --> 40:46.356
Yeah, well, nobody's
gotten shot at your school.

40:46.487 --> 40:47.847
And let's hope
it stays that way.

40:50.622 --> 40:53.407
Pete, meet spinach.
Spinach, meet Pete.

40:53.538 --> 40:54.819
I would like you to have
some of that tonight, okay?

40:54.843 --> 40:56.932
I'd like for all
my nutritional choices

40:57.063 --> 40:58.063
to pay off.

41:15.429 --> 41:18.040
Jeanie Simmons told me today
that Flager Realty

41:18.171 --> 41:19.477
might be expanding,

41:19.607 --> 41:22.436
opening up a new office.

41:22.567 --> 41:24.447
Maybe they'll be looking
for brokers. Who knows?

41:26.788 --> 41:29.225
Flager isn't gonna hire me.

41:29.356 --> 41:31.097
Why not?

41:31.227 --> 41:32.667
You know houses.
You know the market.

41:34.753 --> 41:36.353
At some point,
you got to do something.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.235
Excuse me?

41:39.366 --> 41:41.107
Wh-what was that?

41:42.543 --> 41:44.719
- Just don't...
- No.

41:44.850 --> 41:45.850
No.

41:47.374 --> 41:50.377
Pete, apparently you have
something to say.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.291
- No, I was...
- No, go ahead.

41:51.421 --> 41:52.466
You got something,

41:52.597 --> 41:53.249
you want to get it off
your chest,

41:53.380 --> 41:54.729
get it off your chest.

42:02.911 --> 42:04.751
I think you feel sorry
for yourself too much.

42:06.785 --> 42:09.178
Look, I know a bad thing
happened to you,

42:09.309 --> 42:11.529
but you always said,

42:11.659 --> 42:12.094
"How a person responds
to adversity,

42:12.225 --> 42:13.225
that's his measure."

42:14.096 --> 42:16.795
Hmm.

42:21.016 --> 42:24.759
And you really understand
adversity, don't you, son?

42:24.890 --> 42:28.197
Hmm?

42:28.328 --> 42:30.008
Let me tell you something
right now, Peter.

42:31.331 --> 42:33.115
You don't have
any comprehension of mine.

42:46.128 --> 42:48.261
I'm sorry.

42:56.748 --> 42:59.620
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

43:09.630 --> 43:11.153
What's going on? Where's Lee?

43:11.284 --> 43:13.678
He left.

43:13.808 --> 43:14.461
What do you mean he left?

43:14.592 --> 43:16.506
He just got up and left.

43:16.637 --> 43:18.944
And nobody stopped him?

43:19.074 --> 43:20.989
I don't think anyone noticed.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.643
He was here one minute,
gone the next.

43:45.535 --> 43:47.320
One, two.

43:47.450 --> 43:50.149
One, two.

43:53.152 --> 43:54.259
I don't think it's healthy

43:54.283 --> 43:57.069
to be living so close
to work, ask me.

43:57.199 --> 43:59.159
Well, I didn't ask you,
and I save money on gas.

43:59.201 --> 44:01.203
Plus, statistically,
commuting is less healthy.

44:01.334 --> 44:04.380
So...

44:04.511 --> 44:06.818
We need to open up a new case
for the Rothstein murder.

44:06.948 --> 44:08.558
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

44:08.689 --> 44:09.777
I need you to open a file.

44:09.908 --> 44:11.823
- Well, who's the client?
- I'm the client.

44:11.953 --> 44:13.607
I was talking to Montez.

44:13.738 --> 44:15.478
We're gonna keep each other
in the loop.

44:15.609 --> 44:16.717
Now, he might be able to slip us

44:16.741 --> 44:18.612
some discretionary funding,

44:18.743 --> 44:18.960
but you could consider this
pro bono.

44:19.091 --> 44:21.267
Okay.

44:22.529 --> 44:24.009
- Morning.
- Hi.

44:25.271 --> 44:27.708
- Hey, you.
- Have you read Jimmy Gold?

44:28.230 --> 44:29.971
Who?

44:30.102 --> 44:32.262
This is why you need to get
your ass back to Harvard.

44:35.063 --> 44:37.892
What separates man from beast
is literature.

44:38.023 --> 44:39.023
Read that, all of it.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.803
Maybe Harvard will give you
credit once you go back.

44:53.299 --> 44:54.953
His sentences are way too long.

44:57.042 --> 45:00.001
What? What'd you say?

45:00.132 --> 45:02.240
- I guess I prefer Hemingway.
- It's concise, you know?

45:02.264 --> 45:04.527
Do you, now?

45:04.658 --> 45:06.051
I don't think so,

45:06.181 --> 45:09.097
'cause that would make you
a dumb shite,

45:09.228 --> 45:12.187
whereas we both know of you
as a highly intelligent shite.

45:12.318 --> 45:13.798
Thanks.

45:13.928 --> 45:15.277
Read all of that.

45:15.408 --> 45:17.192
It could inform
on who killed Rothstein.

45:17.323 --> 45:20.108
What, like Rosebud
in "Citizen Kane"?

45:22.110 --> 45:25.897
People are often killed
by someone they know.

45:26.027 --> 45:27.309
Rothstein's novels
are autobiographical.

45:27.333 --> 45:29.596
He was Jimmy Gold.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.294
Now, maybe it was
a simple robbery.

45:32.425 --> 45:33.600
Maybe it wasn't.

45:33.731 --> 45:36.037
Read every word of that.

45:36.168 --> 45:38.910
You'll be a better man for it.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.868
Perhaps even a better
private detective.

47:31.326 --> 47:33.807
Oh, shit.

47:41.206 --> 47:42.468
No.

47:42.598 --> 47:43.991
No, no, no, no.

47:45.558 --> 47:47.255
What the fuck, man?

48:41.527 --> 48:42.745
15 years?

48:42.876 --> 48:45.574
I don't advise that you take it.

48:45.705 --> 48:47.489
Legally, I'm obligated
to tell you about it.

48:47.620 --> 48:48.969
I didn't ask for the offer.

48:50.797 --> 48:51.797
I did, Lou.

48:54.061 --> 48:56.455
Maybe you should take it.

48:56.585 --> 48:59.023
A trial will be
a slow guilty plea.

48:59.153 --> 49:00.328
They got you dead to rights.

49:00.459 --> 49:03.157
But asking 12 jurors
to condemn the woman

49:03.288 --> 49:05.638
who saved the world
from Mr. Mercedes...

49:05.768 --> 49:07.770
What are you about?

49:07.901 --> 49:10.164
She's the one facing the time,
not you.

49:10.295 --> 49:12.099
You're bringing this to trial
for your own reasons...

49:12.123 --> 49:14.777
Career, ego, whatever the fuck,

49:14.908 --> 49:16.431
but it's wrong, and you know it.

49:16.562 --> 49:17.998
Whatever guilt you feel

49:18.129 --> 49:19.869
for getting her
in this position,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.046
I am doing my job,

49:22.176 --> 49:25.788
which is, take all my years
of experience,

49:25.919 --> 49:29.053
my trials,
my knowledge of law and people

49:29.183 --> 49:31.620
and tell her what I think
she should do.

49:31.751 --> 49:34.580
This isn't personal for me.

49:34.710 --> 49:36.016
You can't win.

49:39.889 --> 49:42.501
- I don't guarantee it, no.
- No.

49:44.024 --> 49:46.157
The DA is good,
she will bring it,

49:46.287 --> 49:47.506
but so will I.

49:54.948 --> 49:55.993
15 years in prison.

49:59.257 --> 50:00.497
I don't see how I survive that.

50:02.608 --> 50:04.436
Again, there is insanity.

50:05.915 --> 50:07.047
I think the DA would agree.

50:09.136 --> 50:10.136
- But...
- Oh.

50:15.534 --> 50:17.840
But I guarantee you
if you plead insanity,

50:17.971 --> 50:19.581
you will never be free.

50:19.712 --> 50:20.887
Never.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.018
That's bullshit.

50:27.285 --> 50:28.895
Once they get you
into the system,

50:29.026 --> 50:31.158
they will bury you there.

50:31.289 --> 50:34.944
The law won't decide it.
The doctors will.

50:35.075 --> 50:37.599
The doctors work for the state,

50:37.730 --> 50:41.038
and the state is just
politicians and bureaucrats

50:41.168 --> 50:42.996
that want to put all this
behind them.

50:54.573 --> 50:56.749
Can you win this?

50:56.879 --> 50:58.533
I think I can.

51:01.710 --> 51:03.277
Then let's go for it.

51:03.408 --> 51:05.149
Lou...

51:05.279 --> 51:08.413
If I go to prison
for what I did to Brady,

51:08.543 --> 51:09.979
then Brady wins.

51:10.719 --> 51:13.244
We go to trial.

51:13.374 --> 51:16.203
Yo!

51:16.334 --> 51:17.857
Can I get out?

52:22.443 --> 52:24.619
Oh, shit.

52:39.852 --> 52:42.811
Son. Can I help you?

52:42.942 --> 52:45.858
You already have, a lot.

52:45.988 --> 52:47.381
Oh, my God.

52:47.512 --> 52:49.601
Ah, it's you.

52:49.731 --> 52:50.863
You're okay.

52:50.993 --> 52:52.517
Yes, I am, thanks to you.

52:52.647 --> 52:54.388
Man, I thought
you might be a goner.

52:54.519 --> 52:56.519
Well, I might have been
if you hadn't come along.

52:58.087 --> 52:59.350
How'd you find me?

52:59.480 --> 53:01.023
Oh, I remembered
the Stan McNair logo,

53:01.047 --> 53:02.614
so I tracked you down.

53:02.744 --> 53:04.746
Here to say thank you.

53:04.877 --> 53:05.269
Well, you are
most certainly welcome,

53:05.399 --> 53:06.270
my good man.

53:06.400 --> 53:08.837
Wow. This makes my day.

53:08.968 --> 53:11.318
I mean, I've rescued a lot
of dishwashers in my time,

53:11.449 --> 53:13.799
but this'll be my first
human rescue to speak of.

53:15.801 --> 53:17.300
Damn, son, you look like
you could use a beer.

53:17.324 --> 53:17.890
- Yeah, I know.
- Come on in.

53:18.020 --> 53:20.501
I'd love one.

53:22.547 --> 53:25.071
I'm surprised to see you
up walking around already.

53:26.420 --> 53:27.700
Well, resilient genes, I guess.

53:29.467 --> 53:31.096
Can I ask, why didn't you
take credit for it?

53:31.120 --> 53:33.732
I mean, a Good Samaritan thing
like that?

53:33.862 --> 53:34.862
You're a hero.

53:35.821 --> 53:36.821
Not my thing.

53:38.476 --> 53:40.217
Might have helped
your marketing, even.

53:40.347 --> 53:42.610
Yeah, well,
publicity ain't something

53:42.741 --> 53:43.611
I'm in the market for much.

53:43.742 --> 53:45.352
Why's that?

53:45.483 --> 53:47.876
Well, let's just say it's hard

53:48.007 --> 53:51.445
eking out a living fixing
refrigerators and so forth.

53:53.186 --> 53:57.973
And sometimes I have
to supplement in ways

53:58.104 --> 54:00.976
that, well, bringing
attention to myself

54:01.107 --> 54:02.151
might not be good.

54:02.282 --> 54:03.936
Yeah, well, I hear that.

54:04.066 --> 54:06.199
We're all eking it out, I guess.

54:06.330 --> 54:07.374
Yeah.

54:07.505 --> 54:10.464
Every night, I, like,
pray, "Dear God",

54:10.595 --> 54:12.915
just let me come across a big
ole pile of money, would ya?"

54:13.075 --> 54:15.469
- You and me both.
- Aw.

54:15.600 --> 54:16.600
Cheers.

54:18.994 --> 54:20.431
- Have a seat.
- Mm.

54:26.001 --> 54:27.438
You ever done that, Stan?

54:28.874 --> 54:29.874
Sorry?

54:33.400 --> 54:35.010
Come across a pile of money?

54:36.185 --> 54:38.187
Well, not yet,

54:38.318 --> 54:39.382
but I haven't met
the girl of my dreams either,

54:39.406 --> 54:42.061
so a lot of boxes unchecked.

54:48.633 --> 54:49.913
Why you looking at me like that?

54:52.767 --> 54:53.986
You know what, Stan?

54:57.555 --> 55:00.297
My truck went off the road
about a half mile from here.

55:02.255 --> 55:03.735
I thought you said
you were walking.

55:06.999 --> 55:09.039
It's still sitting
in the ditch where it ended up.

55:10.089 --> 55:11.308
I had luggage in the truck...

55:14.006 --> 55:15.050
Which isn't there.

55:17.183 --> 55:18.463
Means someone must have
found it.

55:23.058 --> 55:24.146
It was maybe you.

55:24.277 --> 55:26.888
I beg your pardon?

55:27.019 --> 55:30.239
It'd be kind of a coincidence
if somebody else just happened

55:30.370 --> 55:33.155
to come upon it
in the middle of nowhere.

55:36.245 --> 55:37.551
You think I took your luggage?

55:37.682 --> 55:39.553
Well, you're wrong.

55:39.684 --> 55:42.077
I don't know anything about
your luggage nor your truck

55:42.208 --> 55:44.776
or that you even had a truck.

55:44.906 --> 55:46.106
You said you got hit by a car.

55:47.474 --> 55:51.173
It's very valuable luggage,
Stan.

55:51.304 --> 55:52.914
Valuable enough...

55:55.917 --> 55:57.765
That I may have to report
the loss to the police.

55:57.789 --> 56:02.097
Valuable enough that they would
follow up on my suspicions

56:02.228 --> 56:04.709
and investigate you.

56:04.839 --> 56:09.235
You and whatever
supplemental enterprises

56:09.366 --> 56:10.526
you might have going on here.

56:12.847 --> 56:14.414
Are you threatening me?

56:19.419 --> 56:21.465
I think a deal
can be worked out.

56:21.595 --> 56:27.253
You return my valuables,
my merchandise,

56:27.384 --> 56:29.603
and I will give you
a very rich reward,

56:29.734 --> 56:31.431
more money than you're used
to seeing.

56:31.562 --> 56:36.480
Brother, I got no idea
what you're talking about.

56:36.610 --> 56:38.210
And I got no idea
what your tone is about

56:38.264 --> 56:40.005
except it doesn't go well

56:40.135 --> 56:41.833
with, "Thank you
for saving my life."

56:41.963 --> 56:44.226
It would be a mistake
to bullshit me.

56:44.357 --> 56:45.637
I've hurt people
for lying to me.

56:47.752 --> 56:51.538
But... I owe you,

56:51.669 --> 56:53.671
so I'm gonna give you
a mulligan, a do-over.

56:55.629 --> 56:56.848
Let's be honest.

56:56.978 --> 56:59.067
Give me what's mine,
and you will come out richer.

56:59.198 --> 57:02.941
I got nothing
that belongs to you.

57:03.071 --> 57:03.550
What's that supposed to mean?

57:03.681 --> 57:10.078
It means that I don't... Hell.

57:10.209 --> 57:11.752
You're the one that broke
into John Rothstein's house,

57:11.776 --> 57:13.168
ain't you?

57:13.299 --> 57:16.520
He was robbed, 20 miles south.

57:16.650 --> 57:18.739
That's what you're
talking about, aren't you?

57:22.090 --> 57:23.410
What, put your loot
in that truck?

57:23.527 --> 57:26.138
That's kind of a big thing
to accuse somebody of.

57:27.444 --> 57:30.272
I'm gonna need you to leave...
Now.

57:30.403 --> 57:33.188
If it was me...

57:33.319 --> 57:34.519
That would make me a killer...

57:35.016 --> 57:37.366
A dangerous person.

57:37.497 --> 57:41.414
Which means if I were you,

57:41.545 --> 57:44.112
I would return
whatever found merchandise

57:44.243 --> 57:45.940
you may have come across.

57:46.071 --> 57:47.311
Look, if your money got took,

57:47.420 --> 57:48.580
it got took by somebody else.

57:54.732 --> 57:57.865
Final offer.

57:57.996 --> 57:59.676
You keep the cash.
You give me the binders.

58:01.260 --> 58:02.900
I have no idea
what you're referring to.

58:05.960 --> 58:07.372
This is the thanks I get
for saving your life.

58:07.396 --> 58:09.050
You think I'm fucking around?

58:12.619 --> 58:13.664
Fuck.

58:24.718 --> 58:25.718
Oh, shit.

58:28.200 --> 58:30.463
Shit. Shit, shit.

59:27.259 --> 59:28.347
Oh, fuck.
