WEBVTT

00:11.402 --> 00:14.840
MAN: YOU LOOKING
FOR RANSOM MONEY?

00:14.884 --> 00:17.147
IS THAT WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT?

00:17.191 --> 00:18.975
HUH?

00:25.895 --> 00:28.332
EVEN IF YOU GET
YOUR DAMN MONEY,

00:28.376 --> 00:31.683
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I WILL MAKE IT MY MISSION

00:31.727 --> 00:34.164
IN LIFE TO HUNT YOU DOWN

00:34.208 --> 00:35.992
AND SEE YOU SUFFER.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.863
AAH!

00:51.007 --> 00:53.531
OK. OK, YEAH.

00:53.575 --> 00:56.360
TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.884
SON OF A BITCH. UH!

01:01.931 --> 01:03.672
APES: ♪ AS THOUGH

01:06.109 --> 01:09.199

A PART OF YOU ♪

01:11.941 --> 01:15.075

HI.

01:36.879 --> 01:39.490
SORRY. DID I GET
THE TIME WRONG?

01:39.534 --> 01:40.926
NO, I'’M SORRY.
IT'’S ME.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.406
I'’M RUNNING WAY
BEHIND SCHEDULE.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.799
PLEASE COME IN.
OK.

01:48.673 --> 01:51.285
MENDOZA: SOMETHING
SMELLS FANTASTIC.

01:51.328 --> 01:54.201
BUT, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'’T
MEAN FOR YOU TO
MAKE US DINNER.

01:54.244 --> 01:55.854
I WANTED TO TAKE
YOU OUT TONIGHT.

01:55.898 --> 01:58.074
I KNOW. I WANTED
TO SURPRISE YOU.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.250
WELL, I AM SURPRISED.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.122
OK. GREAT.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.340
I'’M JUST GONNA
GO CHANGE,

02:03.384 --> 02:04.863
SO PLEASE MAKE
YOURSELF AT HOME,

02:04.907 --> 02:06.517
MAKE YOURSELF A DRINK,
MAYBE TWO,

02:06.561 --> 02:08.693
AND I'’LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OK.

02:11.870 --> 02:14.960
[CELL PHONE DIALS,
LINE RINGS]

02:15.004 --> 02:19.269
EMILY, HOW IS
THE BOLOGNESE DE ROSSI
TURNING OUT?

02:19.313 --> 02:20.792
YEAH, THAT'’S THE THING.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.620
UM, IT'’S NOT TASTING
THE WAY I EXPECTED.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.100
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.667
I'’M PRETTY SURE
I SCREWED UP.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.103
WELL, HOW IS THAT
POSSIBLE?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.497
WELL, I KIND OF MISPLACED
WHAT YOU WROTE DOWN FOR ME,

02:29.540 --> 02:31.151
SO I WINGED IT.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.978
YOU WINGED IT?

02:33.022 --> 02:35.372
YOU DON'’T EXACTLY
HAVE THE MEMORY

02:35.416 --> 02:37.113
OF OUR BOY GENIUS,
YOU KNOW.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.462
THEREIN LIES MY PROBLEM.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.812
SO LET ME GO OVER WHAT
I'’VE DONE SO FAR,

02:40.856 --> 02:44.642
STARTING WITH 28 OUNCES
OF PUREED TOMATOES,

02:44.686 --> 02:46.688
6 OUNCES OF CANNED
TOMATO PASTE,

02:46.731 --> 02:48.429
A HALF CUP OF
ORTO RED WINE--

02:48.472 --> 02:49.691
WHOA, WHOA. STOP.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.171
THAT'’S COOKING WINE.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.737
YES.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.436
EMILY, IF MY DEAR
NONNA TOLD ME ONCE,

02:55.479 --> 02:57.177
SHE TOLD ME
A THOUSAND TIMES,

02:57.220 --> 02:59.483
IF YOU NO DRINK
THE WINE,

02:59.527 --> 03:01.181
YOU NO COOK
WITH THE WINE.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.617
OK, BUT--

03:02.660 --> 03:05.837
THIS IS LIKE WHEN
GARCIA SUBSTITUTED
TOFU FOR PANCETTA.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.840
YOU HAVE TO START OVER.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.843
CIAO.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.196
PRENTISS: HEY.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.557
EVERYTHING OK?

03:31.559 --> 03:33.387
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT PIZZA?

03:35.780 --> 03:38.043
FOR THE RECORD,
I WOULD HAVE HAD

03:38.087 --> 03:40.655
ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM
EATING WHATEVER IT WAS

03:40.698 --> 03:42.613
YOU WERE TRYING TO
GET GOING ON OVER THERE.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.354
OH, THANK YOU.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.356
BUT I COULDN'’T HAVE
LIVED WITH MYSELF

03:46.400 --> 03:48.053
IF AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'’VE BEEN THROUGH,

03:48.097 --> 03:49.707
I POISONED YOU.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.144
WELL, I APPRECIATE YOU
HAVING MY BACK.

03:52.188 --> 03:54.059
AND THIS IS NICE.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.671
I'’M GLAD WE FINALLY
GOT A CHANCE TO DO IT.

03:56.714 --> 03:59.717
GOT TO BE HONEST,
I WAS STARTING TO THINK

03:59.761 --> 04:01.415
THAT YOU WERE TRYING
TO GET OUT OF IT.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.591
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

04:03.634 --> 04:07.899
YOU CALLED ME, WHAT,
5 TIMES TO RESCHEDULE
THIS DATE.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.988
I WASN'’T MAKING
THOSE CASES UP.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.599
I KNOW YOU WEREN'’T.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.383
BUT I'’M THINKING,

04:13.427 --> 04:15.080
YOU AND I MADE
THIS CONNECTION

04:15.124 --> 04:16.604
BASED ON THE FACT
THAT WE HAD TAKEN DOWN

04:16.647 --> 04:18.345
THESE MACHETE KILLERS
TOGETHER.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.739
AND THEN IT DAWNS ON ME,

04:21.783 --> 04:24.438
THAT'’S PRETTY MUCH
AN EVERYDAY THING
FOR YOU.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.703
YEAH, I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

04:28.746 --> 04:31.096
YEAH.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.098
WHEN ARE YOU
CLEARED FOR DUTY?

04:33.142 --> 04:35.753
DAY AFTER TOMORROW.
CAN'’T WAIT.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.886
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

04:37.929 --> 04:40.758
GOOD. GOOD.
YOU KNOW.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.978
WHAT'’S ONE MORE
SCAR, RIGHT?

04:44.806 --> 04:47.287
SOMEONE WISE ONCE SAID
YOU'’VE NEVER REALLY LIVED

04:47.330 --> 04:48.984
IF YOU DON'’T HAVE
ANY SCARS.

04:56.644 --> 04:59.603
HUH. SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEBODY AT THE BAU

04:59.647 --> 05:01.126
REALLY WANTS
YOUR ATTENTION.

05:01.170 --> 05:04.782
IT DOES, BUT IT'’S
MY NIGHT OFF.

05:04.826 --> 05:07.959
BUT I THINK IT'’S LUCKY
FOR ALL OF US

05:08.003 --> 05:12.964
THAT EMILY PRENTISS
DOESN'’T TAKE NIGHTS OFF.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.144
GARCIA: GOOD EVENING.
I AM THE ARTIST

05:19.188 --> 05:21.451
CURRENTLY KNOWN AS SHE
WHO RUINS YOUR EVENING

05:21.495 --> 05:23.671
BY SHARING REVOLTING
VICAP HITS.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.150
CASE IN POINT.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.543
TWO MEN HAVE BEEN MURDERED,
BOTH ATTORNEYS--

05:26.587 --> 05:28.197
SHAUN TATE, ANTHONY NAKAMURA.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.808
SHAUN TATE WAS KILLED
TWO WEEKS AGO IN BALTIMORE.

05:30.852 --> 05:33.637
ANTHONY NAKAMURA WAS FOUND
MURDERED EARLIER TODAY

05:33.681 --> 05:34.856
IN ROCKVILLE.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.248
ACCORDING TO
POLICE REPORTS,

05:36.292 --> 05:38.163
EACH VICTIM WAS
DECLARED MISSING

05:38.207 --> 05:40.427
48 HOURS PRIOR TO
HIS BODY BEING FOUND

05:40.470 --> 05:42.211
DUMPED IN
A DOWNTOWN ALLEY,

05:42.254 --> 05:43.734
EACH WRAPPED IN
A CONSTRUCTION TARP.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.823
EACH MAN WAS
SEVERELY BEATEN,

05:45.867 --> 05:48.783
LIKE EVERY BONE IN
THEIR BODY WAS SMASHED.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.829
AND THEIR HEARTS WERE
CUT OUT OF THEIR CHEST.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.701
PRENTISS: YOU SAID TATE
AND NAKAMURA WERE BOTH LAWYERS,

05:53.744 --> 05:55.006
BUT THEY NEVER
WORKED TOGETHER.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.357
ARE THERE ANY OTHER
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.315
ALVEZ: NOTHING THAT
STANDS OUT, NO.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.926
SIMMONS: NOW, ANTHONY NAKAMURA'’S
AUTOPSY IS STILL PENDING,

06:01.970 --> 06:03.667
BUT SHAUN TATE'’S AUTOPSY
DIDN'’T INDICATE

06:03.711 --> 06:06.627
THAT OUR UNSUB HAS ANY
SURGICAL EXPERTISE.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.019
JUST TORE A GUY'’S
HEART OUT.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.847
ALVEZ: YEAH, OUR UNSUB
IS ACTING ON SOME

06:09.891 --> 06:11.719
PRETTY SADISTIC IMPULSES
RIGHT NOW.

06:11.762 --> 06:14.374
YEAH, IMPULSES LIKELY
DRIVEN BY A NEED TO PUNISH

06:14.417 --> 06:17.377
OR TO SEEK RETRIBUTION
FOR SOME PROFOUND
PERSONAL GRIEVANCE.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.553
BUT IF THIS IS
OUR UNSUB'’S
TWISTED PAYBACK,

06:19.596 --> 06:21.032
WHERE ARE THE HEARTS?

06:21.076 --> 06:22.860
WOULDN'’T HE JUST GET
RID OF THEM NEARBY,

06:22.904 --> 06:24.645
THROW THEM AWAY
LIKE TRASH?

06:24.688 --> 06:26.603
YOU'’D ASSUME THAT IF
HE'’S KEEPING THEM AS
SOUVENIRS OR TROPHIES

06:26.647 --> 06:28.213
THAT THEY MUST
MEAN SOMETHING TO HIM.

06:28.257 --> 06:29.737
OH, I THINK WE NEED
TO BE CAREFUL

06:29.780 --> 06:31.521
NOT TO WALK INTO
THE WEEDS

06:31.565 --> 06:34.524
WITH THE OBVIOUS
SYMBOLISM
GOING ON HERE.

06:34.568 --> 06:37.222
RIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'’RE STILL DOWN A MAN

06:37.266 --> 06:38.746
WITH REID FINISHING
UP HIS CLASSES,

06:38.789 --> 06:40.965
SO, JJ, YOU AND I
WILL HELP GARCIA

06:41.009 --> 06:42.532
WITH THE VICTIMOLOGIES
HERE.

06:42.576 --> 06:45.535
DAVE, TARA, CHECK OUT
ANTHONY NAKAMURA'’S
AUTOPSY.

06:45.579 --> 06:48.233
LUKE, MATT, YOU'’RE
GONNA NEED TO INSPECT
THE DUMP SITES

06:48.277 --> 06:49.887
IN BALTIMORE
AND ROCKVILLE.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.237
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THIS UNSUB IS FAR
FROM GRATIFYING

06:52.281 --> 06:54.109
HIS SADISTIC URGES.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.234
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

08:22.632 --> 08:25.287
JAREAU: "WHAT IS PAST
IS PROLOGUE."

08:25.330 --> 08:27.289
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.727
SO SHAUN TATE WAS MARRIED
WITH A DAUGHTER.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.903
HE PRACTICED MARITIME
LAW IN BALTIMORE.

08:32.947 --> 08:35.427
MEANWHILE, ANTHONY
NAKAMURA WAS A CRIMINAL
DEFENSE ATTORNEY

08:35.471 --> 08:36.864
IN ROCKVILLE,

08:36.907 --> 08:39.736
MARRIED AND DIVORCED
TWICE BUT NO CHILDREN.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.086
OK, WELL, HERE'’S SOME
KIND OF CONNECTION.

08:42.130 --> 08:45.350
BOTH MEN WERE IN
THE SAME GRADUATING
CLASS IN COLLEGE--

08:45.394 --> 08:46.743
WILTMORE UNIVERSITY.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.571
GARCIA: LADIES, YOU'’RE
GONNA WANT TO LOOK

08:48.615 --> 08:51.792
AT THIS SECURITY FOOTAGE
THAT I JUST FOUND.

08:51.835 --> 08:54.272
IT WAS TAKEN IN
THE PARKING LOT OF
ANTHONY NAKAMURA'’S OFFICE.

08:54.316 --> 08:58.276
IT IS THE NIGHT BEFORE
HE WAS REPORTED AS
A MISSING PERSON.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.582
JAREAU: SO IT LOOKS
LIKE NAKAMURA'’S

08:59.626 --> 09:00.975
ON HIS WAY HOME
FOR THE NIGHT

09:01.018 --> 09:03.934
WHEN THIS YOUNG WOMAN
COMES UP TO HIM

09:03.978 --> 09:05.893
IN NEED OF SOME
KIND OF ASSISTANCE.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.591
ASSISTANCE
OR SOLICITATION?

09:08.635 --> 09:10.071
JAREAU: OK, BUT DOESN'’T
IT LOOK MORE LIKE

09:10.114 --> 09:11.855
SHE'’S TELLING HIM
A SOB STORY?

09:11.899 --> 09:13.640
LIKE SHE'’S IN NEED
OF A RIDE.

09:13.683 --> 09:14.945
YEAH, AND HE'’S
MORE THAN WILLING

09:14.989 --> 09:16.599
TO BE HER KNIGHT
IN SHINING BEEMER.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.775
BUT THE ROCKVILLE POLICE
SAID THE LAST PERSON

09:18.819 --> 09:20.472
WHO REPORTED SEEING
NAKAMURA ALIVE

09:20.516 --> 09:22.344
WAS HIS LAW PARTNER,
GEOFFREY FLORES.

09:22.387 --> 09:25.913
UH-HUH. THIS WAS TAKEN
MINUTES AFTER THAT.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.307
PRENTISS: MEANING THIS
WOMAN IS ACTUALLY

09:29.351 --> 09:31.179
THE LAST PERSON WHO
SAW NAKAMURA ALIVE,

09:31.222 --> 09:33.442
AND SHE MAY VERY WELL
BE THE REASON HE'’S DEAD.

09:33.485 --> 09:34.486
PENELOPE, I NEED--

09:34.530 --> 09:35.836
I AM HERE TO FULFILL
YOUR NEEDS.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.359
I HAVE ALREADY
ENHANCED THIS IMAGE.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.230
I'’M RUNNING IT THROUGH
FACIAL RECOGNITION
SOFTWARE NOW.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.623
GOOD. HOPEFULLY
THIS YOUNG LADY'’S

09:40.667 --> 09:42.103
GOTTEN INTO SOME
TROUBLE BEFORE

09:42.146 --> 09:43.670
AND WE CAN GET HER I.D.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.634
EXCUSE ME.

09:51.678 --> 09:52.983
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.637
MAY I HELP YOU?

09:54.681 --> 09:55.899
I SURE HOPE SO.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.509
YOU SEE, MY CAR OVER THERE,

09:57.553 --> 10:00.338
IT JUST BASICALLY
COMPLETELY DIED ON ME.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.340
AND I TOTALLY FORGOT
MY CELL PHONE AT HOME,

10:02.384 --> 10:04.168
SO I WAS WONDERING IF--

10:04.212 --> 10:06.127
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'’T
CARRY ANY JUMPER CABLES

10:06.170 --> 10:07.171
'’CAUSE WITH THIS CAR--

10:07.215 --> 10:09.347
YEAH. IT'’S
A REALLY NICE CAR.

10:09.391 --> 10:10.784
THANKS.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.307
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW,
I COULD CALL

10:12.350 --> 10:13.830
ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE
FOR YOU.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.006
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I WAS SORT OF HOPING

10:16.050 --> 10:18.792
THAT MAYBE YOU COULD
GIVE ME A RIDE BACK
TO MY APARTMENT.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.620
YOUR APARTMENT.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.012
MM-HMM.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.275
YOU SEEM LIKE
A PRETTY NICE GUY,

10:24.319 --> 10:26.016
NOT LIKE A SERIAL
KILLER OR ANYTHING.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.236
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

10:28.279 --> 10:30.978
OK, SURE. GET IN.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.980
YES! THANK YOU.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.285
WHAT'’S YOUR NAME?

10:34.329 --> 10:36.548
IT'’S DENNIS.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.551
I'’M GOING TO OWE YOU
BIG TIME, DENNIS.

10:39.595 --> 10:40.901
MY NAME'’S BECCA.

10:45.209 --> 10:48.256
SO AS YOU REQUESTED,
I REVIEWED THE AUTOPSY

10:48.299 --> 10:50.519
OF YOUR FIRST VICTIM,
MR. TATE,

10:50.562 --> 10:52.739
SO I COULD COMPARE
THEM WITH MY FINDINGS

10:52.782 --> 10:54.392
HERE OF MR. NAKAMURA.

10:54.436 --> 10:55.829
WELL, BOTH MEN APPEAR
TO HAVE SUFFERED

10:55.872 --> 10:57.221
ROUGHLY THE SAME
AMOUNT OF SEVERE

10:57.265 --> 10:58.832
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
TO THEIR BODIES.

10:58.875 --> 11:02.226
YES. AND ALL OF IT
EXACTED PERI-MORTEM,
BEFORE DEATH.

11:02.270 --> 11:05.273
WHILE NEARLY EVERY BONE
IN BOTH OF THESE BODIES

11:05.316 --> 11:06.883
WAS EITHER BROKEN
OR CRACKED,

11:06.927 --> 11:09.320
THE ACTUAL CAUSE
OF DEATH FOR BOTH MEN

11:09.364 --> 11:10.757
WAS EXSANGUINATION

11:10.800 --> 11:13.281
DUE TO THE SEVERING OF
THE CORONARY ARTERIES.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.413
FROM THE REMOVAL
OF THE HEART?

11:15.457 --> 11:17.111
I THINK A MORE
APT DESCRIPTION

11:17.154 --> 11:19.374
WOULD BE DUG OUT.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.726
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT TYPE OF WEAPON
WAS USED HERE?

11:23.770 --> 11:25.380
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I THINK I DO.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.643
FOLLOW ME.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.906
THE SHARP-FORCE
INSTRUMENT USED

11:29.950 --> 11:32.735
LEFT SEVERAL DEEP
IMPRESSIONS IN THE STERNUM.

11:32.779 --> 11:37.522
SO I WAS ABLE TO CAST
A COUPLE OF MIKROSIL
MOLDS OF IT.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.611
LOOKS LIKE THE BLADE
OF A CHISEL.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.613
MEDICAL EXAMINER:
THAT'’S EXACTLY WHAT
I WOULD SAY, TOO.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.746
I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT
WHOEVER DID THIS

11:43.790 --> 11:46.053
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF
THE HAMMER THAT USUALLY
COMES ALONG WITH IT.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.315
ROSSI: MAKES SENSE.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.620
BUT WHAT DOESN'’T MAKE SENSE

11:48.664 --> 11:50.710
IS OUR FEMALE SUSPECT
WHO LURED NAKAMURA

11:50.753 --> 11:52.276
FROM THE PARKING LOT.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.930
YEAH. SHE DOESN'’T
LOOK LIKE SHE'’S GOT

11:53.974 --> 11:56.933
THE UPPER BODY
STRENGTH REQUIRED
TO SHATTER A STERNUM.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.022
AND IF SHE COULDN'’T DO IT,

11:59.066 --> 12:01.938
THEN SHE MUST HAVE
A PARTNER WHO CAN.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.774
SO THIS DISPOSAL SITE
FOR ANTHONY NAKAMURA'’S BODY

12:11.818 --> 12:14.124
BASICALLY MIRRORS
THE ONE FOR SHAUN TATE

12:14.168 --> 12:15.473
THAT WE WALKED
BACK IN BALTIMORE.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.649
THE BODIES ARE WRAPPED
IN THE SAME LOOSE MANNER,

12:17.693 --> 12:19.129
AND THEY'’RE EVEN
ORIENTED NEXT TO
THESE DUMPSTERS

12:19.173 --> 12:20.261
IN NEARLY THE SAME WAY.

12:20.304 --> 12:21.653
EVERYTHING'’S
NEATLY ARRANGED

12:21.697 --> 12:23.133
FOR TEMPORARY
CONCEALMENT.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.831
JUST GOOD ENOUGH
FOR A DUMP AND DASH.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.485
'’CAUSE IT SEEMS AS IF
OUR UNSUBS EXPECTED

12:27.529 --> 12:28.835
SOMEONE TO FIND
THESE VICTIMS.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.750
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.664
SEE, NOTICE THEIR
OCD SIGNATURES HERE?

12:32.708 --> 12:34.492
THESE DUMP SITES
ARE EQUIDISTANT

12:34.536 --> 12:36.059
FROM THE SUSPECTED
ABDUCTION SITES.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.800
3 MILES AS
THE CROW FLIES.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.716
THEY'’RE ALSO THE EXACT
SAME DIRECTION DIAGONALLY,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.326
SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.633
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT'’S ALL ABOUT?

12:44.676 --> 12:46.809
I DON'’T KNOW.

12:46.853 --> 12:50.204
BUT YOU CAN FILE
IT UNDER "WHY HOLD
ON TO YOUR VICTIMS

12:50.247 --> 12:52.467
FOR EXACTLY
48 HOURS?"

12:52.510 --> 12:55.339
IT'’S NOT ABOUT NEEDING
ALL THAT TIME JUST TO
TORTURE AND KILL THEM.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.993
NO, IT ISN'’T.

12:57.037 --> 12:59.561
IT MAKES OUR UNSUB SEEM
FAIRLY WELL-PRACTICED,

12:59.604 --> 13:02.433
ALMOST AS IF NAKAMURA
AND TATE AREN'’T REALLY
THEIR FIRST VICTIMS.

13:06.524 --> 13:07.961
BECCA!

13:16.883 --> 13:18.145
NO.

13:18.188 --> 13:20.364
NO. HELP ME!

13:20.408 --> 13:23.846
HELP ME!
HELP ME!

13:32.768 --> 13:34.901
I DON'’T UNDERSTAND.

13:36.772 --> 13:40.210
WHO ARE YOU?

13:40.254 --> 13:43.213
SO ROCKVILLE P.D.
WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY
OUR MYSTERY WOMAN.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.867
HER NAME IS KIARA HALE,

13:44.911 --> 13:47.043
AND SHE HAS A RATHER
LONG RAP SHEET,

13:47.087 --> 13:48.871
MAINLY ARRESTS
FOR SOLICITATION.

13:48.915 --> 13:49.872
IS SHE IN CUSTODY?

13:49.916 --> 13:52.570
NO, NOT YET.
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

13:52.614 --> 13:57.184
IF YOU SCROLL THROUGH
TO HER CELL PHONE RECORDS,

13:57.227 --> 13:59.403
ACCORDING TO THEM,
HALE WAS IN ROCKVILLE

13:59.447 --> 14:02.580
AT THE SAME TIME
SHAUN TATE WAS BEING
ABDUCTED AND MURDERED

14:02.624 --> 14:05.583
UP IN BALTIMORE.

14:05.627 --> 14:09.718
OK, SO WHAT IF KIARA HALE
ISN'’T THE ONLY WOMAN

14:09.761 --> 14:12.242
PLAYING THE DAMSEL
IN DISTRESS RUSE HERE.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.070
YOU MEAN MULTIPLE
FEMALE UNSUBS?

14:14.114 --> 14:16.072
NO. NOW I'’M RECONSIDERING
THE PROBABILITY

14:16.116 --> 14:19.075
OF JUST ONE UNSUB,
PRESUMABLY MALE,

14:19.119 --> 14:20.903
AND HE'’S USING WOMEN
LIKE HALE.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.514
HE'’S PROBABLY PAYING THEM
TO LURE HIS VICTIMS.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.081
WELL, IF YOU ARE RIGHT,

14:25.125 --> 14:27.649
THESE WOMEN WERE
WITNESSES TO HIS CRIMES.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.607
AND I'’D SAY THERE'S
NO WAY HE COULD TAKE
THE CHANCE

14:29.651 --> 14:31.435
TO KEEP THEM ALIVE.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.002
YEAH. HE'’D HAVE TO
KILL THEM, TOO.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.918
SO WHY HAVEN'’T WE
FOUND THE BODIES

14:35.962 --> 14:37.833
OF THESE WOMEN ALONG
WITH THE MEN?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.791
MAYBE THEY'’RE
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.402
HE CAN SWEEP THEM AWAY,

14:41.445 --> 14:43.926
WHILE THE MEN ARE PART
OF SOME KIND OF STATEMENT,

14:43.970 --> 14:46.276
THE FOCUS OF HIS
RAGE AND REVENGE.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.365
UHH!

15:14.826 --> 15:16.306
PLEASE.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.308
PLEASE.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.658
I CAN'’T...

15:20.702 --> 15:23.226
WHA

15:41.636 --> 15:43.159
[INDISTINCT POLICE
RADIO CHATTER]

15:43.203 --> 15:44.421
PRENTISS: MATT,
WHAT DO WE GOT?

15:44.465 --> 15:46.075
CITY DISPOSAL CREWS
DISCOVERED THE BODY

15:46.119 --> 15:47.555
ABOUT 90 MINUTES AGO,

15:47.598 --> 15:49.209
CALLED IT IN.

15:49.252 --> 15:52.429
ALEXANDRIA POLICE,
THEY NOTIFIED US,
AND THEY HELD THE SCENE.

15:52.473 --> 15:55.432
THE VICTIM'’S BEEN
IDENTIFIED AS
DENNIS KIRKWOOD,

15:55.476 --> 15:57.434
47 YEARS OLD.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.742
HE RAN A FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT COMPANY CALLED
TURNBLADE CAPITAL.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.787
JJ, ARE YOU OK?

16:02.831 --> 16:06.617
YEAH. YEAH, IT'’S JUST ODD.

16:06.661 --> 16:10.099
I HAVE THIS OVERWHELMING
SENSE OF DEJA VU.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.797
WHAT, THE SCENE
LOOK FAMILIAR TO YOU?

16:12.841 --> 16:16.758
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN TO WAY
TOO MANY SCENES LIKE THIS
BEFORE, RIGHT,

16:16.801 --> 16:19.456
SO I DON'’T KNOW
WHAT IT IS EXACTLY.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.110
PRENTISS: WHO REPORTED
KIRKWOOD MISSING?

16:21.154 --> 16:23.460
SIMMONS: HIS WIFE--
48 HOURS AGO,

16:23.504 --> 16:25.419
AFTER HE DIDN'’T
COME HOME FROM A RUN.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.247
HE MUST BE HOLDING
HIS VICTIMS SOMEWHERE

16:27.290 --> 16:28.813
HE FEELS PROTECTED.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.990
SO MAYBE A GOOD PART
OF THAT 48 HOURS

16:31.033 --> 16:34.123
IS THE TRAVEL TIME
TO AND FROM HIS
SECURE LOCATION.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.516
YOU ARE PROBABLY RIGHT,

16:35.559 --> 16:37.083
BUT AS FAR AS
A GEO PROFILE GOES,

16:37.126 --> 16:38.475
IT'’S GONNA BE HARD
TO RECONCILE

16:38.519 --> 16:40.477
THE TWO AXIOMS OF
SERIAL KILLER BEHAVIOR.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.218
NEVER COMMIT A CRIME
CLOSE TO HOME

16:42.262 --> 16:44.655
AND NEVER TRAVEL FARTHER
THAN NECESSARY

16:44.699 --> 16:46.135
TO DISPOSE OF YOUR VICTIMS.

16:46.179 --> 16:48.181
EXACTLY. AND THIS GUY'’S
CROSSED STATE LINES,

16:48.224 --> 16:49.834
WHICH MEANS HE'’S WILLING
TO GO THE EXTRA MILE,

16:49.878 --> 16:52.272
WHICH COMPLICATES
THE MATH.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.231
ALVEZ: TARA,
WE CAUGHT A BREAK.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.668
ROCKVILLE POLICE JUST
PICKED UP KIARA HALE.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.061
SHE'’S ALIVE?

16:59.105 --> 17:00.584
YEAH, SHE IS.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.499
AND FEDERAL MARSHALS
ARE BRINGING HER HERE
RIGHT NOW.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.026
HAVE A SEAT,
MS. HALE.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.767
NO. I DON'’T--
WHY AM I HERE?

17:09.811 --> 17:12.857
THAT'’S YOU WITH
ANTHONY NAKAMURA,

17:12.901 --> 17:14.207
WHO WAS MURDERED,

17:14.250 --> 17:16.122
AND IT TURNS OUT HE
WASN'’T THE ONLY ONE.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.558
SO HAVE A SEAT.

17:19.734 --> 17:22.693
YOU ARE THE MATERIAL
WITNESS TO AT LEAST
ONE HOMICIDE.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.869
NO, I'’M NOT A WITNESS
TO ANY HOMICIDE.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.306
THAT'’S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

17:26.349 --> 17:29.222
WELL, TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED.

17:29.265 --> 17:34.053
THIS GUY EDDIE,
HE POSTED AN AD
ON DTXBOARD.COM.

17:34.096 --> 17:38.361
$5,000 TO HELP HIM
PLAY A PRANK ON
HIS DAD'’S FRIEND.

17:38.405 --> 17:42.409
IT WAS LIKE, DRESS UP
SEXY, SAY LIKE,
MY BOYFRIEND LEFT ME

17:42.452 --> 17:45.194
AND I NEEDED A RIDE
BACK TO MY PLACE.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.717
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.719
ALVEZ: YOU REMEMBER
THE ADDRESS?

17:48.763 --> 17:53.376
YEAH. LIKE,
7634 TYEMAN ROAD.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.639
ALL RIGHT. I'’LL GET
BACK-UP TO CHECK IT OUT.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.558
YOU CAN HELP US BY GIVING
ME EVERY COMMUNICATION

18:01.602 --> 18:03.560
YOU HAD WITH THIS EDDIE,

18:03.604 --> 18:05.606
AND THEN SITTING DOWN
WITH A SKETCH ARTIST.

18:08.870 --> 18:11.829
PRENTISS: CCTV TRAFFIC
CAMERA CAPTURED THIS IMAGE

18:11.873 --> 18:14.005
ON THE AFTERNOON
THAT OUR LAST VICTIM,

18:14.049 --> 18:15.920
DENNIS KIRKWOOD,
WENT MISSING.

18:15.964 --> 18:19.272
ALEXANDRIA P.D. HAVE
IDENTIFIED KIRKWOOD'’S
PASSENGER HERE

18:19.315 --> 18:21.230
AS A REBECCA MARCUS.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.536
SHE'’S ALSO A WORKING GIRL.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.581
SHE'’S TELLING THE SAME
STORY AS HALE,

18:24.625 --> 18:28.063
EXCEPT THAT EDDIE TOLD
HER TO DELIVER KIRKWOOD
TO A DIFFERENT ADDRESS.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.718
FORTUNATELY FOR HER,
HE DOESN'’T SEEM COMPELLED
TO KILL WOMEN.

18:30.761 --> 18:32.633
PRENTISS:
UNFORTUNATELY FOR US,

18:32.676 --> 18:36.245
OUR DESCRIPTION OF
THIS EDDIE IS JUST
TOO GENERIC,

18:36.289 --> 18:38.247
AND LUKE FOUND NOTHING
AT EITHER APARTMENT.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.120
YOU KNOW, EDDIE LOOKS
TOO DAMN YOUNG TO BE
THIS GOOD AT HIS M.O.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.774
YEAH. EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS SPEAKS
TO SOMEONE

18:43.818 --> 18:46.342
WHO'’S HAD MORE
THAN ENOUGH TIME TO
PERFECT THEIR CRAFT.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.997
OK, SO HOW DID OUR
YOUNG EDDIE ACCELERATE
HIS LEARNING CURVE?

18:50.390 --> 18:51.608
GO AHEAD, GARCIA.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.828
SO I WAS DOING
MY DUE DILIGENCE, AS I DO,

18:53.871 --> 18:55.395
ON MR. DENNIS KIRKWOOD,

18:55.438 --> 18:57.266
AND I HAVE FOUND
A BEWILDERING CONNECTION

18:57.310 --> 18:59.442
BETWEEN HIM AND THE FIRST
TWO VICTIMS.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.662
IF I CAN DIRECT YOUR
ATTENTION TO THE BIG SCREEN.

19:01.705 --> 19:05.144
3 YEARS AGO IN BALTIMORE,
MR. KIRKWOOD WAS CONSIDERED

19:05.187 --> 19:08.843
A PERSON OF INTEREST IN
THE DEATH OF ROBIN RHODES,

19:08.886 --> 19:11.802
WHO WAS FISHED OUT OF
THE PATAPSCO RIVER.

19:11.846 --> 19:15.154
SHE WAS 22 YEARS OLD
AND WORKED AS AN INTERN

19:15.197 --> 19:17.982
AT KIRKWOOD'’S COMPANY,
TURNBLADE CAPITAL,
FOR A YEAR.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.594
WERE THERE RUMORS
OF AN AFFAIR?

19:20.637 --> 19:21.899
OH, YOU BETCHA,

19:21.943 --> 19:24.119
ALTHOUGH AT THE TIME
KIRKWOOD WAS ENGAGED

19:24.163 --> 19:25.468
TO HIS CURRENT WIFE.

19:25.512 --> 19:26.991
I MEAN, CURRENT WIDOW.

19:27.035 --> 19:30.473
OK, SO HOW DO TATE
AND NAKAMURA GET
CONNECTED TO ALL THIS?

19:30.517 --> 19:34.477
WELL, KIRKWOOD'’S ALIBI
THE NIGHT THAT ROBIN RHODES
WENT MISSING

19:34.521 --> 19:36.740
WAS THAT HE WAS AT
HIS BACHELOR PARTY.

19:36.784 --> 19:39.003
AND ALTHOUGH I DON'’T HAVE
THE ENTIRE GUEST LIST,

19:39.047 --> 19:40.309
I CAN TELL YOU THAT
TWO PEOPLE AT THAT PARTY

19:40.353 --> 19:43.182
WERE SHAUN TATE
AND ANTHONY NAKAMURA.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.532
AND SO KIRKWOOD
WAS NEVER CHARGED?

19:45.575 --> 19:47.186
NOT ONLY WAS HE
NEVER CHARGED,

19:47.229 --> 19:49.492
BUT AFTER A TWO-YEAR-LONG
INVESTIGATION,

19:49.536 --> 19:51.973
BALTIMORE P.D. DETERMINED
THAT ROBIN RHODES'’ DEATH

19:52.016 --> 19:53.322
WAS--WAIT FOR IT--

19:53.366 --> 19:55.063
JUST ACCIDENTAL.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.543
THEY SAY THAT SHE
WENT FOR A JOG,

19:56.586 --> 19:58.675
SLIPPED OFF A STEEP
EMBANKMENT,

19:58.719 --> 20:00.199
AND HIT
HER HEAD ON A ROCK.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.201
GARCIA, WE'’RE GONNA
NEED YOU TO GET
A COMPLETE LIST

20:02.244 --> 20:04.377
OF ALL THE MEN WHO
WERE AT KIRKWOOD'’S
BACHELOR PARTY.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.988
AND I WILL GET
THAT FOR YOU. COPY.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.859
WELL, IF WE'’RE LOOKING
FOR A PERSONAL TRAUMA

20:08.903 --> 20:11.340
TO INSPIRE REVENGE KILLINGS,
I THINK WE JUST FOUND IT.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.037
AND I THINK WE HAVE
WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW

20:13.081 --> 20:15.083
TO DELIVER THE PROFILE.

20:15.126 --> 20:18.217
OUR UNKNOWN SUBJECT,
AKA EDDIE,

20:18.260 --> 20:20.480
IS DESCRIBED AS BEING
A MALE CAUCASIAN

20:20.523 --> 20:22.917
BETWEEN THE AGES
OF 18 AND 25,

20:22.960 --> 20:26.050
STANDING BETWEEN 5'’10"
AND 6'’2" IN HEIGHT

20:26.094 --> 20:27.704
WITH DARK BLONDE HAIR.

20:27.748 --> 20:31.317
THIS UNSUB IS
WHAT WE CALL A
GRIEF-INDUCED KILLER.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.710
IN HIS HEARTBREAK,
HE IS LASHING OUT

20:33.754 --> 20:35.364
AT THE MEN THAT HE
THINKS ARE RESPONSIBLE

20:35.408 --> 20:38.585
FOR COVERING UP WHAT
HE BELIEVES TO BE
THE MURDER 3 YEARS AGO

20:38.628 --> 20:40.717
OF A ROBIN RHODES.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.850
THIS AFTER BALTIMORE
POLICE CONCLUDED

20:42.893 --> 20:44.504
THAT ROBIN'’S DEATH
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

20:44.547 --> 20:47.724
HE MAY HAVE GENUINE
REASON TO FEEL

20:47.768 --> 20:49.552
THAT EVIDENCE
WAS OVERLOOKED

20:49.596 --> 20:52.120
OR, AS SEEMS
MORE LIKELY,

20:52.163 --> 20:54.253
HE TENDS TOWARD
A PARANOID PERSONALITY.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.385
PRENTISS: UNFORTUNATELY,
THE SKETCH AND DESCRIPTION

20:56.429 --> 21:00.084
WE HAVE DO NOT MATCH
ANY KNOWN ASSOCIATES,

21:00.128 --> 21:02.435
FRIENDS, OR FAMILY
OF MS. RHODES.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.393
AND YET THE KEY TO
THIS CASE WILL LIE

21:04.437 --> 21:06.352
IN RE-EXAMINING
THE CIRCUMSTANCES

21:06.395 --> 21:08.571
OF ROBIN RHODES'’
DISAPPEARANCE AND DEATH.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.965
ALVEZ: GIVEN HIS AGE RANGE,
HE SEEMS TOO YOUNG

21:11.008 --> 21:12.401
TO BE THIS GOOD.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.577
IT'’S TAKEN HIM 3 YEARS
SINCE ROBIN'’S DEATH

21:14.621 --> 21:17.406
TO TRAIN HIMSELF
TO TAKE HIS REVENGE FANTASY

21:17.450 --> 21:19.495
AND TURN IT INTO
A COLD-BLOODED REALITY.

21:23.194 --> 21:25.936
GARCIA, ON PHONE:
OK, I PUT THE ADDRESS
OF ROBIN RHODES'’ MOTHER

21:25.980 --> 21:27.416
INTO YOUR GPS.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.983
SADLY, HER FATHER DIED
WHEN SHE WAS 12.

21:29.026 --> 21:31.202
HER MOTHER IS
DR. ELIZABETH RHODES.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.161
SHE'’S A PRETTY
PROMINENT PSYCHIATRIST.

21:33.204 --> 21:34.858
DR. RHODES IS THE ONE
WHO FILED THE MISSING
PERSONS REPORT

21:34.902 --> 21:36.338
ON ROBIN.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.688
YEAH, AND SHE WAS
SUPER DUPER CRITICAL

21:38.732 --> 21:40.864
OF THE WAY THE INVESTIGATION
WAS HANDLED,

21:40.908 --> 21:44.128
EVEN GOING SO FAR
AS TO THREATEN A CIVIL SUIT

21:44.172 --> 21:45.956
AGAINST THE BALTIMORE P.D.
FOR SAYING THAT

21:46.000 --> 21:48.263
HER DAUGHTER'’S DEATH WAS
JUST A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.134
LEWIS: DEFINITELY
A GRIEVING MOTHER.

21:54.225 --> 21:55.357
HELLO.

21:55.401 --> 21:56.663
MAY I HELP YOU?

21:56.706 --> 21:59.405
I'’M SUPERVISORY
SPECIAL AGENT DAVID ROSSI.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.145
AND THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE
DR. TARA LEWIS.

22:01.189 --> 22:03.496
MAY WE COME IN
AND SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

22:03.539 --> 22:05.106
WHY? WHAT IS THIS
IN REGARDS TO?

22:05.149 --> 22:07.195
IT'’S ABOUT YOUR
DAUGHTER, MA'’AM.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.374
ROSSI: HE'’S GONE BY
THE NAME EDDIE.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.029
WELL, I KNOW SOME EDDIES,

22:15.072 --> 22:17.031
BUT NONE THAT LOOK
LIKE THIS YOUNG MAN.

22:17.074 --> 22:20.991
BUT YOU ARE FAMILIAR
WITH A DENNIS KIRKWOOD?

22:21.035 --> 22:24.255
OF COURSE I AM,
DR. LEWIS.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.475
MR. KIRKWOOD WAS MURDERED,

22:26.519 --> 22:29.348
AND OVER THE LAST WEEK,
TWO OF HIS CLOSE FRIENDS

22:29.391 --> 22:30.827
WERE KILLED AS WELL,

22:30.871 --> 22:33.743
AN ANTHONY NAKAMURA
AND A SHAUN TATE.

22:33.787 --> 22:36.572
ROSSI: AND WE HAVE
REASON TO BELIEVE

22:36.616 --> 22:39.009
THAT THIS YOUNG MAN,
EDDIE HERE,

22:39.053 --> 22:40.924
MURDERED THESE MEN
OUT OF A DESIRE

22:40.968 --> 22:43.231
TO AVENGE YOUR
DAUGHTER'’S DEATH.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.410
WELL, I'’M REALLY NOT
SURE HOW YOU EXPECT ME

22:48.454 --> 22:50.847
TO RESPOND TO ALL OF THIS.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.023
WELL, ACTUALLY, WE
WERE HOPING THAT

22:53.067 --> 22:56.200
YOU MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT EDDIE.

22:56.244 --> 23:00.030
I HOLD ON TO TWO MEMORIES
OF MY CHILD

23:00.074 --> 23:02.555
THAT I SHALL NEVER
BE ABLE TO LET GO...

23:04.948 --> 23:07.647
HER PRECIOUS FACE,

23:07.690 --> 23:09.518
THE FIRST TIME I HELD IT,

23:09.562 --> 23:12.869
AND WHAT WAS LEFT
OF HER FACE

23:12.913 --> 23:15.959
WHEN THE CORONER
PULLED BACK THE SHEET

23:16.003 --> 23:18.701
AND ASKED IF I COULD
IDENTIFY HER.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.052
WE'’RE VERY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

23:22.096 --> 23:23.924
AND I'’M VERY SORRY
THAT IT IS YOUR JOB

23:23.967 --> 23:25.882
TO HUNT DOWN THIS EDDIE.

23:28.102 --> 23:30.713
BECAUSE YOU DON'’T
BELIEVE THE POLICE
CONCLUSION

23:30.757 --> 23:32.149
ABOUT YOUR
DAUGHTER'’S DEATH,

23:32.193 --> 23:34.151
YOU BELIEVE THAT
DENNIS KIRKWOOD
MURDERED HER

23:34.195 --> 23:36.545
AND THAT HIS FRIENDS
LIED TO PROTECT HIM.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.286
IT IS AN ABSOLUTE FACT.

23:38.329 --> 23:41.202
ROSSI: BALTIMORE POLICE
WOULD DISAGREE.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.465
AND I WOULD SAY THAT
THE BALTIMORE POLICE

23:43.509 --> 23:45.554
IS JUST A MEN'’S CLUB
THAT COLLECTS ITS DUES

23:45.598 --> 23:47.643
FROM RICH, ENTITLED
MEN LIKE KIRKWOOD.

23:47.687 --> 23:50.080
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
BELIEVE, DR. LEWIS?

23:50.124 --> 23:52.735
LET'’S TALK ABOUT THE MEN
WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY'’RE
UNTOUCHABLE

23:52.779 --> 23:54.258
BECAUSE OF THEIR WEALTH.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.695
I KNOW THE TRUTH.

23:55.738 --> 23:58.132
ROBIN MEANT NOTHING TO THEM.

23:59.438 --> 24:03.572
BUT SHE DOES MEAN
SOMETHING TO THIS
YOUNG MAN.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.576
AND IF YOU'’RE
PROTECTING HIM

24:07.620 --> 24:09.404
FOR ANY REASON...

24:11.319 --> 24:14.104
I WISH I KNEW THIS MAN

24:14.148 --> 24:16.672
BECAUSE I WOULD THANK HIM.

24:23.636 --> 24:25.594
SIMMONS: THERE'’S NO
DOUBT THAT DR. RHODES'’
GRIEF IS REAL,

24:25.638 --> 24:27.770
SO SHE MAY WANT
OR EVEN ENCOURAGE

24:27.814 --> 24:29.032
SOMEONE TO EXACT
REVENGE FOR HER.

24:29.076 --> 24:31.513
YEAH, BUT WANTING TO DO IT

24:31.557 --> 24:33.472
AND ACTUALLY TAKING
THE STEPS DO IT

24:33.515 --> 24:35.517
ARE VERY DIFFERENT
PROPOSITIONS.

24:35.561 --> 24:36.823
YES, THEY ARE.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.912
GARCIA MANAGED TO GET
AHOLD OF HER CLIENT LIST.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.043
IT'’S ALL HERE IN
THESE REPORTS.

24:40.087 --> 24:41.784
ADDISON.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.310
EDWARD ADDISON.

24:46.354 --> 24:47.573
ALVEZ: WHAT ABOUT HIM?

24:47.616 --> 24:50.489
I'’M NOT SURE.
GIVE ME A SECOND.

24:56.364 --> 24:59.715
I KNEW I HAD SEEN
SOMETHING LIKE THESE
CRIME SCENES BEFORE.

24:59.759 --> 25:00.803
WE BOTH HAVE,

25:00.847 --> 25:02.413
IN MILWAUKEE 11 YEARS AGO.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.981
BUT THEY WERE WOMEN,
6 WOMEN.

25:22.129 --> 25:23.652
I CAN'’T BELIEVE
I FORGOT.

25:23.696 --> 25:26.394
IT WAS A TERRIBLE
TIME FOR US.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.527
GIDEON WAS GONE,
HOTCH WAS SUSPENDED,

25:28.570 --> 25:31.181
STRAUSS WAS TRYING
TO TEAR UP THE BAU,

25:31.225 --> 25:34.707
AND YOU WERE LEAVING.

25:44.455 --> 25:46.283
THEIR HEARTS WERE
CUT OUT, TOO.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.372
YEAH, BY JOE SMITH,

25:48.416 --> 25:51.027
WHOSE WIFE ABANDONED
HIM AFTER HE WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER,

25:51.071 --> 25:52.855
WHICH TRIGGERED HIS
PSYCHOTIC RAGE

25:52.899 --> 25:54.553
TOWARDS ALL THE WOMEN
IN MILWAUKEE.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.250
YEAH. I REMEMBER
WHEN WE ARRESTED HIM,

25:56.293 --> 25:57.686
HE SAID HE'’D NEVER
STAND TRIAL

25:57.730 --> 25:59.862
BECAUSE THE CANCER
WOULD GET HIM FIRST,
BUT IT DIDN'’T.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.690
HE DIED IN PRISON
LAST YEAR.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.605
SO YOU THINK WE'’RE
DEALING WITH A COPYCAT HERE?

26:03.649 --> 26:05.346
WORSE.

26:05.389 --> 26:07.304
DR. RHODES'’ CLIENT LIST.

26:07.348 --> 26:11.134
SO BACK THEN, YOU TOLD
ME THE ADDISONS WERE
MOVING TO BALTIMORE.

26:11.178 --> 26:13.615
YEAH, AFTER THEY
ADOPTED JOE SMITH'’S SON.

26:13.659 --> 26:16.096
THEY RENAMED HIM
EDWARD ADDISON AND THEY...

26:19.926 --> 26:21.623
OH, MY GOD.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.234
THE EDDIE WE'’RE LOOKING
FOR IS DAVID SMITH.

26:24.278 --> 26:26.846
THE SON OF
A SERIAL KILLER.

26:38.118 --> 26:42.557
LOOK, MAN, PLEASE.
I GOT A BABY.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.167
A BABY BOY.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.257
IS THAT RIGHT, HUH?

26:47.301 --> 26:48.302
YES.

26:48.345 --> 26:49.477
A BABY BOY?

26:49.520 --> 26:54.395
YES. PLEASE DON'’T DO THIS.

27:00.793 --> 27:04.927
YOU KNOW, IF YOU REALLY
THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND
OF MAN YOU ARE,

27:04.971 --> 27:08.452
IF YOU'’RE HONEST
WITH YOURSELF,

27:08.496 --> 27:11.368
YOU KNOW YOUR BOY'’S
GONNA BE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT YOU.

27:11.412 --> 27:13.632
NO!

27:13.675 --> 27:15.198
THAT'’S NOT TRUE.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.464
TRUST ME,

27:20.508 --> 27:21.944
THIS IS GONNA HURT.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.468
NO!

27:24.512 --> 27:24.904
UHH!

27:30.257 --> 27:31.519
PRENTISS: WHEN DAVID SMITH
WAS 8 YEARS OLD,

27:31.562 --> 27:34.000
HIS SERIAL KILLER
FATHER USED HIM AS BAIT

27:34.043 --> 27:35.610
TO LURE HIS VICTIMS.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.091
DAVID BECAME SO INURED
TO THIS BEHAVIOR

27:38.134 --> 27:40.746
THAT HE ACTUALLY LURED
HIS FATHER'’S LAST VICTIM

27:40.789 --> 27:42.486
WITHOUT EVEN
BEING PROMPTED.

27:42.530 --> 27:45.141
WHAT HAPPENED TO DAVID AFTER
HIS FATHER WAS ARRESTED?

27:45.185 --> 27:47.230
WAS CPS ABLE TO REUNITE
HIM WITH HIS MOTHER?

27:47.274 --> 27:49.624
THEY WERE.
SHE DIDN'’T WANT HIM.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.322
SO I KEPT TABS ON
HIS FOSTER CARE
AND HIS THERAPY.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.063
FORTUNATELY,
ABOUT A YEAR LATER,

27:54.107 --> 27:56.544
KATE AND ALAN ADDISON
ADOPTED DAVID.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.677
THEY DECIDED TO CHANGE
HIS NAME TO EDWARD,

27:58.720 --> 28:00.853
AND THEY MOVED TO
BALTIMORE IN 2011.

28:00.896 --> 28:03.072
DID YOU CONTINUE TO
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HIM?

28:03.116 --> 28:06.467
I WISH I COULD HAVE, BUT...

28:09.252 --> 28:12.255
ANYWAY, THE LAST TIME
I CHECKED ON DAVID

28:12.299 --> 28:14.344
HE WAS DOING ABOUT AS
WELL AS ONE COULD EXPECT.

28:14.388 --> 28:15.911
SIMMONS: SO BASED ON
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT
ROBIN RHODES,

28:15.955 --> 28:17.696
THERE WAS NEITHER
A DAVID SMITH NOR
AN EDWARD ADDISON

28:17.739 --> 28:19.219
THAT WAS EVER PART
OF HER LIFE.

28:19.262 --> 28:21.656
THE ONLY CONNECTION
THEY HAVE IS
THROUGH HER MOTHER,

28:21.700 --> 28:24.528
DR. RHODES, WHO TOOK HIM
IN AS A CLIENT LAST YEAR.

28:24.572 --> 28:27.314
WELL, SHE COULDN'’T BE
PAYING HIM TO KILL OFF

28:27.357 --> 28:28.968
KIRKWOOD AND ALL
HIS FRIENDS.

28:29.011 --> 28:30.926
JAREAU: NO, DAVID'’S
INHERITED IMPULSES

28:30.970 --> 28:32.711
WOULDN'’T ALLOW
HIM TO COMMIT

28:32.754 --> 28:35.583
SUCH A PURELY MERCENARY
ACT OF VIOLENCE.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.890
AND WE KNOW VENGEANCE
ISN'’T EMOTIONALLY
TRANSFERRABLE,

28:37.933 --> 28:39.543
SO WHY WOULD DAVID
BE KILLING THESE MEN

28:39.587 --> 28:41.502
TO SATISFY DR. RHODES'’
NEED FOR REVENGE?

28:41.545 --> 28:43.417
PRENTISS: DR. RHODES
WAS ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

28:43.460 --> 28:45.419
OF THE FACT THAT DAVID'’S
INTERNALIZED LOVE MAP

28:45.462 --> 28:48.204
IS IN A STATE OF
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.206
EVEN WHEN I FIRST
ENCOUNTERED HIM,

28:50.250 --> 28:53.732
HE WAS SUSCEPTIBLE
TO EXTREME MATERNAL
TRANSFERENCE.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.734
IT'’S ALSO WHY HE'S
NOT INCLINED TO HARM

28:55.777 --> 28:57.518
HIS FEMALE
ACCOMPLICES.

28:57.561 --> 29:00.564
ALVEZ: SO DAVID WAS
WORRIED THAT HE SHARED
HIS DAD'’S VIOLENT URGES,

29:00.608 --> 29:02.610
AND HE WENT TO
DR. RHODES FOR HELP,

29:02.653 --> 29:04.394
BUT INSTEAD OF
HELPING HIM,

29:04.438 --> 29:07.658
SHE MANIPULATED HIS TRUST IN
ORDER TO DO HER OWN BIDDING.

29:07.702 --> 29:09.486
I BET SHE'’S TELLING HIM
THAT THESE GUYS

29:09.530 --> 29:11.140
ARE JUST LIKE DEAR OLD DAD,

29:11.184 --> 29:12.881
AND IF HE HAS THIS
URGE TO KILL,

29:12.925 --> 29:15.057
THE BEST WAY OF WORKING
THROUGH IT ALL

29:15.101 --> 29:16.667
IS TO KILL THEM.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.321
WE JUST GOT ANOTHER VICTIM.

29:18.365 --> 29:20.584
BODY WAS JUST DISCOVERED
IN GEORGETOWN.

29:20.628 --> 29:23.892
JAMES BAXTER,
A RISK MANAGER AT
DELLINGTON CAPITAL.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.415
NO DOUBT ANOTHER
GENTLEMAN

29:25.459 --> 29:27.156
OFF OF
DENNIS KIRKWOOD'’S
GUEST LIST.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.463
DAVE, TARA, I'’D LIKE YOU
TO BRING IN DR. RHODES AND--

29:29.506 --> 29:30.769
LEAN ON HER
A LITTLE BIT?

29:30.812 --> 29:33.815
A LITTLE BIT.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.904
ROSSI: NOT ONLY DO YOU
KNOW AN EDDIE,

29:35.948 --> 29:38.211
YOU KNOW THE EDDIE
WE'’RE LOOKING FOR.

29:38.254 --> 29:39.908
HE WAS YOUR PATIENT.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.606
MAN: OK, LET'’S JUST
STATE FOR A FACT

29:42.650 --> 29:44.826
MY CLIENT DID NOT
LIE TO YOU PEOPLE.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.262
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

29:46.306 --> 29:48.395
YEAH, I'’M PRETTY SURE
SHE HAS A DEEP UNDERSTANDING

29:48.438 --> 29:50.789
AND APPRECIATION FOR
A LITTLE SOMETHING CALLED

29:50.832 --> 29:52.355
PHYSICIAN-PATIENT PRIVILEGE.

29:52.399 --> 29:53.922
DR. RHODES, I'’VE HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY

29:53.966 --> 29:56.882
TO READ SOME OF YOUR
PUBLISHED WORK ON
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY.

29:56.925 --> 30:00.015
AND I'’M QUITE SURE WHEN
YOU STARTED YOUR PRACTICE,

30:00.059 --> 30:02.278
YOU DID HOPE TO ALLEVIATE
YOUR PATIENTS'’ SUFFERING.

30:02.322 --> 30:07.283
IT WAS MY HOPE,
AND IT IS MY ACCOMPLISHMENT
AS WELL, DR. LEWIS.

30:07.327 --> 30:08.807
BUT NOT FOR EDDIE.

30:08.850 --> 30:12.462
HE CAME TO YOU
A YEAR AGO AFTER HIS
FATHER DIED IN PRISON,

30:12.506 --> 30:14.464
DESPERATE FOR HELP.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.249
AND I GET IT.
YOU WERE STILL RAW

30:16.292 --> 30:18.120
ABOUT ROBIN'’S DEATH
BEING RULED AN ACCIDENT.

30:18.164 --> 30:20.122
BUT INSTEAD OF
EASING HIS PAIN,

30:20.166 --> 30:24.039
YOU SELFISHLY TWISTED IT
TO GRATIFY YOUR OWN NEED
FOR REVENGE.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.781
NO. I REALLY DID
NO SUCH THING.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.828
HE'’S OBVIOUSLY ONE OF
THOSE PARANOID
SCHIZOPHRENIC TYPES

30:29.871 --> 30:33.222
WHO IS TARGETING
ROBIN'’S ASSAILANTS
ALL ON HIS LONESOME.

30:33.266 --> 30:36.269
WE BOTH KNOW THAT'’S NOT
WHY HE'’S KILLING
THESE MEN, DON'’T WE?

30:36.312 --> 30:40.969
ONE REASON HE
MAY BE KILLING IS
PURE GENETICS.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.405
IT'’S IN THE BLOOD.

30:42.449 --> 30:44.451
LAWYER: YOU'’VE GOT NOTHING
TO ARREST MY CLIENT,

30:44.494 --> 30:45.800
SO WE'’RE DONE HERE.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.455
AND IF I FIND OUT YOU
GUYS ARE FOLLOWING MY CLIENT

30:48.498 --> 30:50.152
WITHOUT PROBABLE CAUSE,

30:50.196 --> 30:52.633
I'’M GOING TO SUE
YOUR ASSES OFF.

30:54.417 --> 30:56.898
PENELOPE, YOU SAID YOU HAD
SOMETHING ON EDWARD ADDISON?

30:56.942 --> 30:58.726
YEAH, I'’VE BEEN
BACKTRACKING HOW HE'’S

30:58.769 --> 31:01.120
SOLICITING HIS FEMALE
HELPERS ONLINE.

31:01.163 --> 31:02.948
LOOKS LIKE HE TRIED
TO COVER HIS TRACKS

31:02.991 --> 31:05.341
BY BOUNCING AROUND
TO DIFFERENT
CLASSIFIED AD WEBSITES.

31:05.385 --> 31:08.475
THIS IS HIS LATEST AD.
IT WENT LIVE TWO MINUTES AGO.

31:08.518 --> 31:09.998
CAN YOU STOP SOMEONE
FROM ANSWERING THAT AD?

31:10.042 --> 31:11.304
DONE AND DONER.

31:11.347 --> 31:12.479
I'’M GOING TO ASSUME
YOU CAN'’T PINPOINT

31:12.522 --> 31:13.915
HIS COMPUTER'’S LOCATION.

31:13.959 --> 31:14.960
WELL-ASSUMED, MY LOVE.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.700
BUT WE MIGHT FINALLY
GET THE CHANCE

31:16.744 --> 31:18.398
TO START PLAYING
OFFENSE.

31:18.441 --> 31:20.400
I'’M GOING TO COORDINATE
WITH OUR UNDERCOVER
TACTICAL TEAM.

31:20.443 --> 31:22.358
WE ARE GOING TO ANSWER
THIS AD OURSELVES

31:22.402 --> 31:24.360
AND BAIT DAVID OUT
INTO THE OPEN.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.796
YEAH, WE ARE.

31:44.424 --> 31:46.730
AGENT PRICE
IN POSITION. OVER.

31:46.774 --> 31:49.429
COPY THAT. WE HAVE
EYES ON YOU. OVER.

31:49.472 --> 31:51.126
MATT AND I ARE ALSO
IN POSITION,

31:51.170 --> 31:53.694
BUT NOTHING
UNUSUAL YET. OVER.

32:00.135 --> 32:03.051
WELL, HE'’S RUNNING LATE.

32:03.095 --> 32:04.574
HE KNOWS WE'’RE HERE.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.446
I EXPECTED HE WOULD.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.453
HEY.

32:13.496 --> 32:14.976
WHAT'’S THE DEAL?
YOU'’RE LATE.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.978
SMITH: PLEASE, I NEED
TO SPEAK TO EMILY.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.459
EMILY? WHO THE HELL
IS EMILY?

32:19.502 --> 32:22.941
SMITH: STOP. I WANT TO
SPEAK TO EMILY.

32:31.688 --> 32:35.388
IT'’S OK. STAND DOWN.

32:35.431 --> 32:36.867
HELLO, DAVID.

32:41.829 --> 32:46.399
HI. ARE YOU DAVID?
I'’M EMILY.

32:48.488 --> 32:49.750
EMILY, I...

32:51.839 --> 32:54.363
JUST NEVER THOUGHT
I'’D HEAR YOUR VOICE AGAIN.

32:54.407 --> 32:56.104
BUT YOU KNEW
I'’D BE HERE.

32:56.148 --> 32:57.801
IT'’S YOUR JOB,
ISN'’T IT?

32:57.845 --> 33:00.804
YES, IT IS.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.589
YOU USED TO VISIT ME.

33:02.632 --> 33:04.199
I REMEMBER.

33:04.243 --> 33:08.464
AND IF I GOT SCARED,
YOU SAID YOU'’D BE THERE.

33:08.508 --> 33:11.076
BUT YOU WEREN'’T.
REMEMBER?

33:11.119 --> 33:12.903
I HAVE NO EXCUSES,
DAVID.

33:12.947 --> 33:13.904
I'’M SORRY.

33:13.948 --> 33:15.471
ME, TOO.

33:15.515 --> 33:16.995
BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.648
NO, DAVID, PLEASE LISTEN.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.085
YOU DON'’T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'’RE DOING.

33:20.128 --> 33:21.303
I DO.

33:21.347 --> 33:23.044
MATT, LUKE, PRICE AND I
ARE ON THE MOVE.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.480
WE'’RE COVERING
THE SOUTH. OVER.

33:24.524 --> 33:27.048
SMITH: THESE MEN
NEED TO SUFFER.

33:27.092 --> 33:29.137
THEY NEED TO BE PUNISHED
FOR WHAT THEY'’VE DONE,

33:29.181 --> 33:31.009
JUST LIKE MY FATHER.

33:31.052 --> 33:34.012
YOU ONLY THINK THAT
BECAUSE SHE TOLD YOU.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.188
SHE LIED, DAVID.

33:36.231 --> 33:39.365
SIMMONS: DAVID SMITH. FBI!

34:04.955 --> 34:09.221
JJ, CUT OFF THE ACCESS
ROAD THAT LEADS TO
RIALTO STREET.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.789
JAREAU: BY THE TIME
WE GOT THERE,
DAVID WAS GONE.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.182
HE'’S IN THE WIND.

34:14.226 --> 34:15.662
LEWIS: WELL, GARCIA
FINALLY HAS A LIST COMPILED

34:15.705 --> 34:17.185
OF DAVID KIRKWOOD'’S
PARTY GUESTS.

34:17.229 --> 34:19.231
WE HAVE FEDERAL MARSHALS
PLACING THE REST OF THEM

34:19.274 --> 34:20.841
INTO PROTECTIVE
CUSTODY AS WE SPEAK.

34:20.884 --> 34:24.105
GOOD, ONLY I'’M NOT
SO SURE THOSE MEN

34:24.149 --> 34:25.628
ARE ON DAVID'’S MIND
RIGHT NOW.

34:25.672 --> 34:28.892
BUT IF HE FEELS BETRAYED
BY HIS IDEALIZED
MATERNAL FIGURE,

34:28.936 --> 34:30.720
HE MIGHT JUST DECIDE
TO KILL HIMSELF.

34:30.764 --> 34:34.115
OR DEVOLVE TO THE POINT
WHERE HE FINALLY SUBSCRIBES

34:34.159 --> 34:36.683
TO HIS FATHER'’S PSYCHOTIC
RAGE TOWARD WOMEN.

34:36.726 --> 34:39.425
WHICH MEANS YOU'’D
BE HIS TARGET.

34:39.468 --> 34:43.342
NO, NOT ME.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.960
YOU REALLY SHOULD
ANSWER MY CALLS.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.182
YOU LIED TO ME.

35:09.455 --> 35:11.674
BALTIMORE P.D. CONFIRMED
A BREAK-IN AT DR. RHODES'’ HOME.

35:11.718 --> 35:12.675
SHE'’S GONE.

35:12.719 --> 35:14.068
WE'’RE ON OUR WAY
THERE NOW.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.723
ALVEZ: EMILY, WE'’VE
LOCATED THE ADDISONS.

35:16.766 --> 35:18.203
THEY'’RE UP IN LANCASTER.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.596
THEY SAY THEY HAVEN'’T
SEEN DAVID IN WEEKS,

35:20.640 --> 35:23.033
THAT HE ACTUALLY MOVED
OUT OF THEIR HOUSE
OVER A YEAR AGO.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.383
THAT WOULD BE RIGHT
AROUND THE TIME

35:24.426 --> 35:25.906
HIS DAD DIED IN PRISON.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.386
IT DEFINITELY
TRIGGERED HIM,

35:27.429 --> 35:28.952
AND HE PROBABLY WANTED
TO MAKE SURE HE DIDN'’T

35:28.996 --> 35:30.389
DO ANYTHING TO HURT
HIS ADOPTIVE PARENTS.

35:31.781 --> 35:33.261
PENELOPE AND MATT
HAVE SOMETHING.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.176
SIMMONS: SO WITH THAT
LAST CRIME SCENE

35:35.220 --> 35:38.179
AND PLUS A LIST OF
ADDRESSES FOR OUR VICTIMS
AND POTENTIAL VICTIMS--

35:38.223 --> 35:40.181
WE FINALLY HAVE
ENOUGH DATA

35:40.225 --> 35:42.444
TO CALCULATE THE
PROBABLE COMFORT ZONE

35:42.488 --> 35:44.925
OF DAVID'’S HORRIBLE
HOME AWAY FROM HOME.

35:44.968 --> 35:46.579
JAREAU:
LOOKS LIKE SOMEWHERE

35:46.622 --> 35:48.102
IN BRIAR POINT,
MARYLAND.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.670
PROBABLY
SOMEPLACE TIED TO
THE RHODES FAMILY.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.759
SAY, SOMETHING LIKE
THE OLD DEFUNCT

35:52.802 --> 35:55.457
FREEDMAN MEDICAL DEPOT
THAT'’S OWNED BY
DR. RHODES'’ UNCLE?

35:55.501 --> 35:57.416
JJ, LET'’S GO.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.725
I DIDN'’T LIE
TO YOU DAVID.

36:02.769 --> 36:05.467
KIRKWOOD MURDERED
ROBIN.

36:06.947 --> 36:10.733
AND THOSE OTHER MEN,
THEY ALL HELPED HIM
GET AWAY WITH IT.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.257
NO.

36:12.300 --> 36:15.825
EMILY, THE POLICE.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.436
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

36:17.479 --> 36:18.785
NO.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.787
THESE MEN WERE INNOCENT.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.441
NO.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.747
AND I...

36:24.791 --> 36:26.793
YOU DID NOTHING WRONG.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.403
IT WAS JUSTICE.

36:28.447 --> 36:29.883
SHUT UP!
LOOK!

36:29.926 --> 36:31.450
I KNOW YOU'’RE OLD ENOUGH
TO UNDERSTAND THIS.

36:31.493 --> 36:34.192
I WILL NOT ALWAYS
BE AROUND.

37:06.528 --> 37:07.834
AAH!

37:19.846 --> 37:21.761
DAVID, PLEASE.

37:27.419 --> 37:30.422
DON'’T--
DON'’T DO THIS.

37:30.465 --> 37:32.119
PRENTISS: DAVID, STOP.

37:32.162 --> 37:35.644
IT DOESN'’T HAVE TO
END LIKE THIS.

37:35.688 --> 37:37.690
THIS ISN'’T WHO
YOU REALLY ARE.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.739
DAVID: YOU TAKE THIS.

37:43.783 --> 37:44.740
I CAN'’T.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.264
TAKE IT! LOOK, YOU JUST--

37:46.307 --> 37:47.743
YOU PUT YOUR FINGER
ON THE TRIGGER.

37:47.787 --> 37:48.918
PRENTISS: NO.

37:48.962 --> 37:50.006
AND YOU POINT IT
RIGHT AT HER.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.878
HURRY. THIS IS
THEIR FAULT. ALL RIGHT?

37:51.921 --> 37:54.228
THIS IS THEIR FAULT.
WE'’RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.229
ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.317
WE'’RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.927
COME ON. POINT IT.
POINT IT. POINT IT.

37:57.971 --> 38:02.236
PRENTISS: NO, DAVID, LISTEN.
THIS ISN'’T WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.717
BUT IT IS.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.371
IT'’S EXACTLY WHO I AM.

38:06.414 --> 38:10.375
RHODES: DAVID, PLEASE...

38:10.418 --> 38:12.290
PUT DOWN THE GUN.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.990
LET ME TELL THEM
THE TRUTH, OK?

38:20.950 --> 38:23.431
I MADE DAVID KILL
THOSE MEN.

38:24.954 --> 38:29.045
I GAVE HIM--GAVE
HIM THEIR NAMES.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.699
I GAVE HIM THE MONEY.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.919
I GAVE HIM
THIS PLACE.

38:32.962 --> 38:34.921
PRENTISS: I WON'’T
LIE TO YOU.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.097
THE ROAD FROM HERE
IS HARD.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.012
BUT THERE'’S HOPE.

38:42.363 --> 38:44.452
LET ME HELP YOU.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.592
IF YOU DON'’T WANT
TO TAKE MY HELP,

38:53.635 --> 38:56.116
THEN YOU'’RE GONNA
HAVE TO SHOOT ME.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.987
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

38:59.380 --> 39:01.600
PLEASE DON'’T
MAKE ME DO THIS.

39:01.643 --> 39:04.864
I'’M NOT GONNA MAKE YOU
DO ANYTHING YOU DON'’T
WANT TO DO.

39:04.907 --> 39:09.129
EMILY, NO.

39:09.172 --> 39:11.958
DAVID, GO AHEAD.

39:12.001 --> 39:13.960
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

39:14.003 --> 39:17.790
SHOOT ME IF THAT'’S
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.935
OH, MY GOD, EMILY.

39:40.203 --> 39:43.163
I'’M SO SORRY.
SHH.

39:43.206 --> 39:45.339
I'’M SO, SO SORRY.

39:45.383 --> 39:49.343
IT'’S ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW. I KNOW.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.780
THIS IS WHO YOU
REALLY ARE.

39:58.221 --> 40:00.833
PRENTISS: IT'’S BEEN SAID
THAT MARK TWAIN ONCE OBSERVED,

40:00.876 --> 40:03.531
"HISTORY NEVER
REPEATS ITSELF,

40:03.575 --> 40:05.838
BUT IT OFTEN RHYMES."

40:05.881 --> 40:08.884
OHH, MY HEART HURTS
FOR DAVID.

40:08.928 --> 40:11.713
FATE WAS AWFULLY
CRUEL TO HIM.

40:11.757 --> 40:15.238
HE WAS BORN AND RAISED
IN HIS FORMATIVE YEARS

40:15.282 --> 40:18.198
BY A PSYCHOPATH.
WHAT CHANCE DID HE
REALLY HAVE?

40:18.241 --> 40:20.200
THE ADDISONS WERE
GOOD PEOPLE,

40:20.243 --> 40:23.159
BUT THE DAMAGE HAD
ALREADY BEEN DONE.

40:23.203 --> 40:25.684
I CAN'’T HELP THINKING
THAT GIVEN DIFFERENT
CIRCUMSTANCES,

40:25.727 --> 40:27.468
I MIGHT HAVE CHANGED
THINGS FOR HIM.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.470
NO.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.864
DON'’T PUT THIS ON
OR ANYWHERE NEAR YOU.

40:31.907 --> 40:36.085
I KNOW. IT'’S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THAT, THOUGH.

40:36.129 --> 40:38.523
IT'’S MORE ABOUT REMEMBERING
WHAT I INTENDED TO DO

40:38.566 --> 40:43.092
AND RECONCILING WITH
WHAT I HAD TO DO.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.230
ANYWAY, IT'’S LATE.
OR REALLY EARLY.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.884
WE'’LL GET BACK AT THIS
IN A COUPLE HOURS.

40:51.927 --> 40:53.233
GOOD NIGHT.

40:53.276 --> 40:55.409
GOOD NIGHT.

41:06.768 --> 41:11.556
HEY. HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT BREAKFAST?

41:12.992 --> 41:14.776
IT'’S OPEN.

41:20.042 --> 41:21.870
HEY.
GOOD MORNING.

41:21.914 --> 41:23.176
HEY.

41:23.219 --> 41:26.135
SO CONTRARY TO
PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE,

41:26.179 --> 41:28.007
I CAN ACTUALLY COOK.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.748
OH, WOW. I WAS
LOOKING FORWARD

41:29.791 --> 41:31.750
TO SOME
LEFTOVER PIZZA,

41:31.793 --> 41:34.579
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'’S ALL RIGHT.

41:34.622 --> 41:37.016
YOUR INSTINCTS
WERE CORRECT.

41:37.059 --> 41:39.279
ABOUT WHAT?

41:40.715 --> 41:42.674
YOU KNOW, ABOUT
THOSE TIMES BEFORE.

41:42.717 --> 41:44.502
I WAS BLOWING YOU OFF.

41:44.545 --> 41:49.942
I MEAN, I DID HAVE
TO WORK, BUT I COULD
HAVE MADE THE TIME.

41:49.985 --> 41:53.119
AND THE TRUTH IS,
IT'’S JUST HARD

41:53.162 --> 41:55.469
IN THIS LINE OF WORK.

41:55.513 --> 41:58.298
IT'’S HARD TO GET
CLOSE TO SOMEONE.

41:58.341 --> 42:01.997
AND MAYBE I HAVE
SOME SCARS THAT

42:02.041 --> 42:04.347
HAVEN'’T TOTALLY HEALED.

42:05.740 --> 42:07.133
YEAH.

42:07.176 --> 42:08.830
SO DO I.

42:10.702 --> 42:13.487
THAT'’S OK, RIGHT?

42:13.531 --> 42:16.316
'’CAUSE SOMEBODY PRETTY
WISE ONCE TOLD ME

42:16.359 --> 42:19.145
A PERSON WHO DOESN'’T
HAVE ANY SCARS

42:19.188 --> 42:21.756
HASN'’T LIVED.

42:21.800 --> 42:25.020
SO I'’M WEARING MINE
LIKE A BADGE OF HONOR.

42:28.415 --> 42:31.505
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING'’S READY.

42:31.549 --> 42:35.509
YOU KNOW WHAT,
LET IT BURN,

42:35.553 --> 42:38.381
BECAUSE I KNOW THIS
GREAT PIZZA PLACE

42:38.425 --> 42:40.383
THAT DELIVERS.

42:51.351 --> 42:54.659
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

42:54.702 --> 42:56.704
