01:31.417 --> 01:33.254
<i>Reporting to you live from Lynwood County</i>

01:33.353 --> 01:36.142
<i>where a chilling scene
has been discovered by police.</i>

01:36.222 --> 01:39.813
<i>The bodies of four family members
were found inside early this morning</i>

01:39.893 --> 01:43.636
<i>in what police are describing
to be a brutal homicide.</i>

01:43.730 --> 01:46.939
<i>We are collaborating with various
law enforcement agencies</i>

01:47.033 --> 01:50.742
<i>on a possible connection to a previous
set of murders in Oakwood Glen.</i>

01:55.875 --> 01:59.584
<i>Dozens of miniature cameras
were found inside the property,</i>

01:59.879 --> 02:03.169
<i>hidden in household objects
such as smoke detectors,</i>

02:03.249 --> 02:05.126
<i>bookshelves and light fixtures.</i>

02:05.218 --> 02:09.223
<i>These killers are broadcasting
their crimes as a live feed.</i>

02:10.223 --> 02:11.845
<i>Viewers apparently had no idea</i>

02:11.925 --> 02:14.804
<i>that what they were watching
was happening in real life.</i>

02:14.928 --> 02:16.271
<i>I thought that it was fake.</i>

02:16.496 --> 02:18.135
<i>You just don't expect it to be real.</i>

02:18.231 --> 02:21.872
<i>I kind of feel sick to my stomach
about it, but it's still entertaining.</i>

02:22.068 --> 02:26.949
<i>It appears that these victims were given
the opportunities to defend themselves.</i>

02:29.342 --> 02:31.652
<i>This played out like
some kind of deadly game.</i>

02:33.413 --> 02:36.236
<i>The violence was kind of overwhelming...</i>

02:36.316 --> 02:37.886
- <i>Gruesome and...</i>
- <i>Graphic.</i>

02:37.984 --> 02:41.295
<i>But it was okay in the moment
because it was like a horror movie.</i>

02:41.454 --> 02:44.367
<i>I was rooting for them.
I really didn't want them to die.</i>

02:44.524 --> 02:48.748
<i>The whereabouts of a fifth family member
Marissa Vasquez are unknown tonight</i>

02:48.828 --> 02:51.751
<i>as authorities continue to search
for the young woman missing</i>

02:51.831 --> 02:53.640
<i>since the horrifying incident.</i>

02:55.168 --> 02:59.275
<i>Our working theory is that this feed
is being transmitted on a time delay.</i>

03:00.907 --> 03:03.096
<i>These killers are treating their broadcasts</i>

03:03.176 --> 03:05.098
<i>like a Hollywood horror movie,</i>

03:05.178 --> 03:07.488
<i>designed with one chilling purpose...</i>

03:09.382 --> 03:10.725
<i>...to entertain.</i>

03:12.552 --> 03:16.523
<i>The question that remains is,
will these killers strike again?</i>

03:16.623 --> 03:19.968
- <i>And if so...</i>
- <i>How will they select their victims?</i>

03:55.495 --> 03:56.599
<i>I keep having this...</i>

03:59.199 --> 04:00.610
<i>This nightmare.</i>

04:01.868 --> 04:03.905
<i>It starts the same every night.</i>

04:04.671 --> 04:05.911
<i>There's...</i>

04:07.207 --> 04:08.695
There's a storm outside.

04:08.775 --> 04:12.587
It's thunder and lightning and...

04:15.548 --> 04:17.221
I feel like I'm not alone.

04:17.784 --> 04:20.788
<i>Like someone's watching me.</i>

04:21.421 --> 04:25.028
<i>Someone is watching you? Who's watching you?</i>

04:26.526 --> 04:28.836
- <i>Her.</i>
- <i>Your mother?</i>

04:29.762 --> 04:31.332
<i>Well, at first I just...</i>

04:32.031 --> 04:33.533
<i>I feel her presence.</i>

04:33.800 --> 04:36.610
<i>But when the lightning flashes,
I can see her.</i>

04:37.003 --> 04:38.949
<i>She's laying on the kitchen table.</i>

04:41.241 --> 04:45.121
<i>And she's got a shroud over her.</i>

04:45.211 --> 04:47.033
<i>So what's happening in Jamie's world?</i>

04:47.113 --> 04:50.185
<i>And I can see all these bugs,</i>

04:51.351 --> 04:55.041
<i>these spiders and cockroaches,
and they're just...</i>

04:55.121 --> 04:56.376
<i>I'm fine.</i>

04:56.456 --> 04:59.130
<i>They're just eating away at her.</i>

05:01.361 --> 05:02.897
<i>Are you feeling scared?</i>

05:05.531 --> 05:06.669
<i>No.</i>

05:08.434 --> 05:11.847
<i>Those are very scary images.</i>

05:12.538 --> 05:16.782
<i>It's okay to be scared.
It's perfectly normal to be scared.</i>

05:17.777 --> 05:19.256
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:20.847 --> 05:26.695
<i>Sometimes letting yourself be
vulnerable makes you stronger.</i>

05:30.089 --> 05:34.094
<i>So do you think your father
has dealt with his grief well?</i>

05:34.994 --> 05:36.337
<i>No.</i>

05:36.562 --> 05:39.975
<i>He came home one day
with this new girlfriend.</i>

05:40.466 --> 05:42.139
<i>You must resent him for that.</i>

05:43.303 --> 05:46.512
<i>I don't resent him. I resent her.</i>

05:47.407 --> 05:49.887
<i>That's your stepmother, Olivia.</i>

05:50.376 --> 05:51.912
<i>How do you feel about Olivia?</i>

05:52.845 --> 05:54.586
<i>She's so different from my mom.</i>

05:55.982 --> 05:58.963
<i>I barely survived the first six months
of their marriage.</i>

06:01.321 --> 06:04.496
<i>Now, I gotta be stuck with her
on a whole 10-day vacation.</i>

07:15.661 --> 07:17.664
I told you, you should have peed
at the airport.

07:19.232 --> 07:20.575
I understand that.

07:28.975 --> 07:31.683
It's not gonna be a problem.
I'm gonna take care of it.

07:33.045 --> 07:34.701
Is there some maid you hired I'm unaware of?

07:34.781 --> 07:36.624
Coat on the rack,
suitcase out of the way. Come on.

07:36.716 --> 07:38.753
Wait, wait, wait. Steve.

07:39.185 --> 07:40.473
- Dad!
- Let me explain.

07:40.553 --> 07:42.999
- You're shouting.
- Let me explain.

07:43.389 --> 07:45.528
I'm gonna get you the money.
You have my word.

07:46.526 --> 07:48.199
The deposit should go through any day now.

07:48.961 --> 07:50.702
It's not like I'm trying to fuck you over!

07:52.298 --> 07:54.437
I'm not trying to give you the runaround.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.236
Look, I'm gonna work something out here.

08:06.078 --> 08:09.787
DJ, no food! It's almost 11:00.

08:12.018 --> 08:13.554
I know you can hear me.

08:29.669 --> 08:31.740
You've gotta be kidding me.

08:34.974 --> 08:36.919
Look, you don't have to threaten me.

08:37.477 --> 08:40.582
Expect a check tomorrow afternoon.
Two days at most.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.419
Okay, fine.

08:54.994 --> 08:58.237
- Is it a healthy snack at least?
- It's gluten-free.

08:58.698 --> 09:01.076
- Really?
- What?

09:03.202 --> 09:05.341
- How do you eat this?
- It's delicious.

09:11.811 --> 09:15.054
Something smells good.
You guys have a snack without me?

09:17.717 --> 09:20.129
What happened to the wallpaper in my room?

09:23.523 --> 09:24.968
Just feeling it out.

09:25.925 --> 09:27.529
We were gonna run it by you.

09:28.761 --> 09:30.206
But you didn't.

09:30.363 --> 09:32.240
And you just went into my room?

09:32.331 --> 09:34.277
Look, I really think
you're really going to like it.

09:34.367 --> 09:36.506
Look, I understand you're mad.

09:37.036 --> 09:38.991
Of course, we were gonna tell you first.

09:39.071 --> 09:43.019
We just thought that we'd
find something that you liked.

09:44.143 --> 09:47.716
Funny, because I don't remember
anybody ever having a problem

09:47.847 --> 09:50.919
with my wallpaper before. Right, DJ?

09:52.184 --> 09:55.461
- Right, DJ?
- Yeah. Totally.

09:56.022 --> 09:57.262
I mean,

09:57.356 --> 10:00.929
actually, that wallpaper is kind of creepy.

10:08.701 --> 10:11.773
Okay. This is really uncool.

10:11.871 --> 10:13.282
Jamie...

10:16.075 --> 10:19.648
You told me you were gonna ask her
before we tested the paint.

10:19.745 --> 10:22.168
I was going to,
and then I remembered how she reacted

10:22.248 --> 10:24.537
when I asked if I could throw out
her Harry Styles posters.

10:24.617 --> 10:26.028
This is not helping here.

10:26.452 --> 10:28.131
I mean, how'd she even see it?

11:33.319 --> 11:36.198
Hey, Josh, it's me. I've left you
like a thousand messages

11:36.288 --> 11:38.461
so just call me back when you get this.

11:53.639 --> 11:55.175
DJ!

11:56.642 --> 11:57.985
DJ!

11:59.178 --> 12:00.521
DJ!

12:01.781 --> 12:02.953
What?

12:03.449 --> 12:05.895
My charger, why did you take it?

12:06.786 --> 12:09.164
I don't know what you're talking about.
I have my own charger.

12:09.522 --> 12:12.059
- I don't believe you.
- Fine.

12:12.324 --> 12:13.530
Wait!

12:13.926 --> 12:16.736
So, you're not screwing with me?

12:16.829 --> 12:18.866
No. I'm being totally normal.

12:19.365 --> 12:20.753
You should try it sometime.

12:20.833 --> 12:23.837
Wait, Deej, wait.

12:25.404 --> 12:27.543
- I'm sorry.
- Whatever.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.051
Come on.

12:31.310 --> 12:32.755
It's just you and me, right?

12:35.347 --> 12:36.417
Sure.

12:38.284 --> 12:40.321
DJ, take out the trash!

14:23.689 --> 14:26.295
- Oh, my, God! Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get out!

14:26.659 --> 14:28.605
- <i>Sorry.</i>
- <i>Get out of here!</i>

15:47.740 --> 15:48.878
Cool.

16:04.156 --> 16:06.136
You're gonna die!

16:06.525 --> 16:07.847
Matt!

16:07.927 --> 16:10.134
- I'm sorry, dude.
- You definitely frightened...

16:10.329 --> 16:13.640
So, that was too easy.
You were just like a sitting duck, man.

16:13.799 --> 16:15.938
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

16:19.138 --> 16:20.617
You survive Florida, my man?

16:21.573 --> 16:25.077
Yeah. It was pretty boring. Hot as hell.

16:25.577 --> 16:27.784
I went to the beach, went to dinner.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.917
I'd rather be playing Xbox, but...

16:32.885 --> 16:34.364
It's on already?

16:34.486 --> 16:36.022
- Hell, yeah.
- Okay, I'm getting my revenge.

16:36.288 --> 16:38.911
- Let's do this.
- No, you can't push it like that.

16:38.991 --> 16:42.029
That is against the rules.
You can't do that, no!

16:42.127 --> 16:45.575
You can't score. DJ, I'm gonna kick your...

16:46.332 --> 16:48.676
- Hey, bro.
- You staying a while?

16:51.203 --> 16:52.512
I don't...

16:53.906 --> 16:56.819
Yeah, this... It's kind of a long story.

16:57.343 --> 17:00.518
Matt? It's 11:30 at night.

17:01.113 --> 17:02.854
Wait, why didn't you just call us at least?

17:03.482 --> 17:06.771
I was going to call, but Sheryl kind of

17:06.852 --> 17:10.276
accidentally deliberately
threw my cell phone in the toilet.

17:10.356 --> 17:12.393
But he's gonna be out of here in three days.

17:12.590 --> 17:14.400
Tops. Three days tops.

17:14.792 --> 17:17.865
Hi, Liv, how are you?
I'm good, thanks. Thanks for asking.

17:17.963 --> 17:20.034
- How you doin'?
- Oh, my God.

17:20.132 --> 17:22.169
No way. You're too hot for this guy.

17:22.267 --> 17:24.509
This is stupid. This just doesn't even work.

17:24.603 --> 17:25.707
- We got some pizza in the freezer.
- The two of you.

17:25.804 --> 17:27.593
- Go get some food.
- Okay.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.209
I'll set you up in the room.

17:53.165 --> 17:54.474
Coming!

17:55.968 --> 17:57.208
Yeah.

18:01.540 --> 18:04.521
- Hey, Killer. Hi.
- Hey, there.

18:06.078 --> 18:09.001
Now's not actually a good time to talk.

18:09.081 --> 18:10.720
No. No, no.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.493
You're not getting off that easy.

18:14.686 --> 18:17.257
You gotta give me something.
Come on, it's me.

18:18.857 --> 18:22.168
Catch me up.
I wanna know about your life. Go.

18:23.462 --> 18:25.635
Olivia's trying to destroy my life.

18:25.931 --> 18:29.572
Okay, first of all, refined sugars,
that's what's destroying your life.

18:29.701 --> 18:32.910
Second of all, Olivia is not scary at all.

18:33.205 --> 18:35.242
If anything, she's terrified of you.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.020
Why would she be afraid of me?

18:38.177 --> 18:41.625
'Cause you're a teenage girl.
Teenage girls are terrifying.

18:41.847 --> 18:44.794
One look from a teenage girl

18:44.883 --> 18:47.261
will send most men off... You just did it.

18:47.719 --> 18:49.130
You did the teenage girl look.

18:49.321 --> 18:50.960
I'm terrified right now.

18:51.557 --> 18:52.661
You see?

18:56.795 --> 18:58.001
I just feel like...

18:59.298 --> 19:02.575
Like I don't have a say in anything,
you know? And it stresses me out.

19:02.868 --> 19:06.816
It's good not to have a say in things.
You just gotta chill.

19:06.905 --> 19:09.977
Believe me, I know.
That's why I self-medicate.

19:12.344 --> 19:13.550
Really?

19:14.313 --> 19:16.691
It's for my glaucoma. You know that.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.226
All right, good talk, son.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.127
You gotta get out of this funk.

19:24.389 --> 19:25.766
Come here.

19:26.725 --> 19:27.965
Okay.

19:28.060 --> 19:31.303
Do your homework and eat more vegetables.

19:31.530 --> 19:34.443
And drink more water and exercise.

19:34.533 --> 19:36.069
That's what your uncle Matt says.

19:36.602 --> 19:38.241
It's really good. It's really good.

19:52.718 --> 19:55.096
He's my brother. What am I supposed to do?

20:03.162 --> 20:04.402
You tuck him in.

20:46.572 --> 20:49.712
<i>Hey, guys. Look at the camera.</i>

20:49.875 --> 20:51.946
- <i>Look up at the camera and smile.</i>
- What the...

20:52.611 --> 20:54.784
<i>What do you think? Is that a butterfly?</i>

20:54.880 --> 20:56.723
- <i>A butterfly!</i>
- <i>A butterfly?</i>

20:58.150 --> 20:59.925
<i>Did Mommy make a big butterfly, too?</i>

21:00.385 --> 21:01.694
<i>Great job too, Mommy.</i>

22:09.221 --> 22:12.862
<i>Hey, I got your texts. All 20,000 of them.</i>

22:12.958 --> 22:14.947
<i>I was worried that on your way home
from the airport</i>

22:15.027 --> 22:17.166
<i>you got trapped under a burning car.</i>

22:18.130 --> 22:21.111
- Can I ask you a question?
- <i>Yeah, go for it.</i>

22:25.404 --> 22:29.045
Do you see us staying together?

22:29.775 --> 22:32.187
I mean, like, past senior year.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.589
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:36.882 --> 22:39.124
<i>I mean, I think so. Do you?</i>

22:39.685 --> 22:40.823
Yeah.

22:44.623 --> 22:46.193
<i>Babe, what's going on?</i>

22:47.592 --> 22:49.595
Nothing. I don't want to talk about it.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.273
<i>Talk about what?</i>

23:10.615 --> 23:11.924
<i>Babe, what's going on?</i>

23:14.786 --> 23:16.026
Do you think

23:17.889 --> 23:20.012
even when people die

23:20.092 --> 23:22.265
they could still judge you for your mistakes?

23:23.295 --> 23:24.934
<i>Baby, are you talking about your mom?</i>

23:28.233 --> 23:29.678
<i>It's been six years.</i>

23:30.902 --> 23:32.905
<i>All right? What would she judge you for?</i>

23:34.973 --> 23:36.452
I gotta go.

23:37.576 --> 23:39.556
<i>Come on, I miss you,
and you're freaking me out.</i>

23:41.913 --> 23:45.122
<i>Talk to me. Like, did I do something?</i>

23:45.217 --> 23:47.026
<i>Did I screw up? Say something wrong?</i>

23:48.353 --> 23:51.163
No. No, it's not you. I just...

23:54.393 --> 23:56.498
- Yeah, I gotta go.
- <i>Jame.</i>

24:24.790 --> 24:27.737
Does she know I'm 35 grand deep?
No, I'd be a dead man.

24:29.261 --> 24:31.070
- Thirty five grand?
- Look, don't...

24:31.797 --> 24:33.743
Jesus, even the rich are poor.

24:35.133 --> 24:37.909
Here, man, it sounds like
you need this more than I do.

24:42.941 --> 24:45.319
Oh, God, it's like we're back in senior year.

24:46.878 --> 24:48.721
Where'd you get this shit anyway?

24:49.314 --> 24:51.351
Same guy we got it from in senior year.

24:52.117 --> 24:53.994
- No.
- No, I'm not kidding, man.

24:54.286 --> 24:56.163
- Dirk, he's a lifer.
- No.

24:56.555 --> 24:58.592
All right, I'm going to arrive
around the corner. Watch out.

24:58.957 --> 25:00.266
There's a guy right there.

25:02.461 --> 25:03.667
What the hell?

25:05.897 --> 25:07.433
Okay, sorry, I'm back, guys.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.342
Come on. That's bull crap.

25:20.278 --> 25:21.587
Jame?

25:24.816 --> 25:26.022
Yeah?

25:28.887 --> 25:30.594
Just wanted to see if you're okay.

25:33.758 --> 25:35.601
Yeah, I'm okay.

25:38.563 --> 25:40.065
Listen, I...

25:44.536 --> 25:47.210
We shouldn't have gone in your room
without your permission.

25:47.305 --> 25:48.477
It was stupid of me.

25:52.077 --> 25:54.523
I know this transition's been rough.

25:54.846 --> 25:57.588
And the last thing you need is someone
invading your privacy.

26:06.658 --> 26:08.797
All right. Good night.

26:15.300 --> 26:16.609
Night, Dad.

26:27.445 --> 26:30.085
Five more minutes, then the game
goes off and the teeth get brushed.

26:30.549 --> 26:32.529
- Can it be 10?
- Five.

26:45.297 --> 26:46.367
Shit.

26:49.401 --> 26:52.314
Maybe I've been trying to change too much.

26:53.238 --> 26:55.275
I'm just afraid
I'm never gonna connect with her.

26:56.107 --> 26:57.450
Stop it.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.719
You're just feeling each other out.

27:03.081 --> 27:05.755
Besides, you got lucky.

27:06.718 --> 27:08.527
You missed the zombie years.

27:10.589 --> 27:13.263
The piss, the shit,

27:13.725 --> 27:14.931
the puke.

27:16.461 --> 27:19.237
You took a shortcut
to the best parts of motherhood.

27:54.933 --> 27:55.934
No.

28:01.139 --> 28:03.244
What the fuck?

28:53.291 --> 28:54.998
What the fuck?

29:07.038 --> 29:08.517
Jesus!

29:09.841 --> 29:10.945
What?

29:16.347 --> 29:17.587
DJ?

30:14.205 --> 30:15.445
<i>It's started.</i>

31:48.366 --> 31:49.743
Two to three minutes.

31:50.735 --> 31:52.078
Yeah, okay.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.277
I'm in here!

33:43.915 --> 33:45.155
Hello?

34:33.164 --> 34:35.143
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

34:38.136 --> 34:39.342
I got it.

34:56.554 --> 34:59.865
- What's going on?
- I don't know, I heard something.

35:00.158 --> 35:01.603
- Okay.
- What's going on?

35:06.631 --> 35:07.735
Matt,

35:09.333 --> 35:10.403
is that you?

35:13.571 --> 35:14.641
What was that sound?

35:18.543 --> 35:19.647
Matty?

35:22.780 --> 35:23.884
Matt?

35:33.257 --> 35:35.066
- Call the police.
- Okay.

35:37.195 --> 35:39.141
Dad, what was down there?

35:40.064 --> 35:41.338
What did you see?

35:42.600 --> 35:44.739
- What are you getting?
- It's okay.

35:45.970 --> 35:47.609
Just hang back, guys, okay?

35:57.949 --> 35:59.121
The phones are gone.

35:59.984 --> 36:02.240
Okay, get back in the bedroom
and lock the door. Now.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.061
Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on.

36:04.422 --> 36:06.766
Jamie! Jamie, come on!

36:07.992 --> 36:10.768
Stay up here. Listen to what your dad said.

37:17.628 --> 37:18.800
Hello?

37:26.637 --> 37:27.707
Matty?

37:34.245 --> 37:36.691
Matty, if this is you, it's not funny.

37:40.151 --> 37:41.186
Shit.

38:01.806 --> 38:02.910
Shit.

39:05.603 --> 39:06.980
Jesus Christ!

39:15.980 --> 39:17.118
What the fuck?

39:19.250 --> 39:22.026
Dad! Please come back upstairs.

39:22.119 --> 39:24.895
Jamie, go back upstairs.
Everything's gonna be okay.

39:25.122 --> 39:27.612
Dad, please. Please, come back upstairs.

39:27.692 --> 39:29.831
It's okay, sweetie. Get back up there.

39:40.171 --> 39:41.548
I can't see anything.

39:46.210 --> 39:47.587
What's going on down there?

39:53.284 --> 39:54.627
Dad...

40:25.649 --> 40:27.805
Dad! Dad!

40:27.885 --> 40:29.387
Adam! No!

40:31.489 --> 40:33.093
Get off of him!

40:40.097 --> 40:42.668
- Get off of him, please!
- Dad!

40:43.567 --> 40:45.513
Jamie, get back here!

40:46.904 --> 40:48.110
Dad!

40:49.240 --> 40:51.584
Come on, go, go, go!

40:53.377 --> 40:54.515
We have to help him!

40:54.612 --> 40:55.989
- No, we have to help him!
- Jamie, just come with us!

40:56.080 --> 40:57.787
- This way, we gotta go!
- Get in!

41:02.586 --> 41:04.589
- What do we do?
- Lock the door. Look the door.

41:04.688 --> 41:06.065
Help me. Come on.

41:30.181 --> 41:31.182
Is it okay?

41:31.282 --> 41:32.283
Oh, shit.

41:35.152 --> 41:36.791
No! Hold it!

41:38.722 --> 41:40.099
No!

41:41.358 --> 41:42.462
No!

41:55.973 --> 41:57.350
Is he gone?

42:01.979 --> 42:03.219
Oh, my God.

42:09.820 --> 42:10.924
Jamie.

42:36.113 --> 42:39.492
- Check under the bed!
- Jamie, I'm scared.

42:39.683 --> 42:41.492
- It's gonna be okay.
- No, no, I'm just scared.

42:42.052 --> 42:43.053
Where are the phones?

42:43.153 --> 42:44.393
- What are you doing?
- Where the hell are the phones?

42:44.488 --> 42:45.899
- We have to help him!
- We wait for the...

42:45.990 --> 42:47.697
The phones were right here.
Where are the phones?

42:47.892 --> 42:50.270
We gotta go downstairs,
and we have to help him!

42:50.361 --> 42:51.738
There's somebody downstairs.

42:51.829 --> 42:53.741
Our only priority right now
is to get out of this house.

42:53.831 --> 42:55.186
- Do you understand?
- How are we gonna do that?

42:55.266 --> 42:56.836
Check the windows. See if we
can get out through that side.

42:59.737 --> 43:01.580
We can't jump. It's way too high.

43:06.377 --> 43:09.222
- What is that? What was that?
- Back away. Back, back, back.

43:09.580 --> 43:12.356
We have to get out of here.

43:16.387 --> 43:19.266
Help! Help us!

43:20.024 --> 43:21.469
Help!

43:27.398 --> 43:30.607
Help us! Somebody help!

43:35.873 --> 43:37.853
- What is it?
- Nothing, nothing.

43:38.876 --> 43:40.913
- What? What is it?
- Get back, get back, get back!

43:48.452 --> 43:49.954
- Oh, my God.
- What's that?

43:52.423 --> 43:54.665
What is that? What is happening?

43:55.192 --> 43:56.569
<i>You don't understand.</i>

43:57.561 --> 43:59.049
<i>It's ridiculous. It's like...</i>

43:59.129 --> 44:01.185
Jamie? Jamie, what is this?

44:01.265 --> 44:05.212
<i>She treats me like a child, but yet she's
closer to my age than to my dad's.</i>

44:05.569 --> 44:06.570
I don't know.

44:07.071 --> 44:08.225
I don't know.

44:08.305 --> 44:10.444
- <i>She's a total gold digger.</i>
- They were watching me...

44:10.975 --> 44:12.229
<i>And the grossest part is,</i>

44:12.309 --> 44:14.312
<i>I think my little brother has a crush on her.</i>

44:14.411 --> 44:17.153
- What the hell is this?
- I don't know. I don't know.

44:18.983 --> 44:23.090
<i>You know, my dad acts like
I'm the one with the problem.</i>

44:23.220 --> 44:25.666
<i>But really, he's the one in total denial.</i>

44:26.490 --> 44:27.662
What is this?

44:27.758 --> 44:29.499
<i>He's the one that's responsible for all this.</i>

44:29.593 --> 44:31.596
Is this a prank between you and your friends?

44:31.829 --> 44:34.618
- This isn't funny, Jamie!
- No, I don't know how they got these!

44:34.698 --> 44:37.922
- How'd it get on the screen?
- I don't know. He's filming me!

44:38.002 --> 44:39.106
<i>Sometimes...</i>

44:41.639 --> 44:43.118
<i>Sometimes, I wish it was him.</i>

44:50.214 --> 44:52.126
- It's okay.
- Oh, my God.

44:53.183 --> 44:54.605
No!

44:54.685 --> 44:55.686
Turn it off.

44:55.786 --> 44:58.494
- It's okay.
- Turn it off! Turn it off!

45:04.728 --> 45:07.937
- Who's doing this?
- I don't know!

45:10.000 --> 45:12.879
- Jamie, I'm scared.
- Okay. Okay, look...

45:13.137 --> 45:14.491
All right. All right, we just stay calm.

45:14.571 --> 45:16.093
We're gonna get out of this house.

45:16.173 --> 45:18.710
Okay? Just help me look for something sharp.

45:18.809 --> 45:20.345
Something we can protect ourselves with.

45:22.646 --> 45:24.023
There's nothing here.

45:27.384 --> 45:28.920
I can't find anything.

45:31.221 --> 45:33.292
- I can't find anything.
- Come on, keep looking.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.039
I found something.

45:39.163 --> 45:40.665
That's good. Just hold on to it, okay?

45:41.031 --> 45:44.479
Come on, Jame, here.
We'll just take the glass, okay?

45:44.835 --> 45:47.042
All right, listen. Come here. Listen to me.

45:48.305 --> 45:51.013
We're gonna walk out
of that door right now. Okay?

45:51.308 --> 45:52.912
- Just stay together.
- Are you sure?

45:53.010 --> 45:55.699
Everyone's gonna be fine, I promise.
Just stay together, okay?

45:55.779 --> 45:57.782
You know what, it's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine. Come on.

45:58.582 --> 46:00.027
Come on.

46:00.818 --> 46:02.263
Help me.

46:12.930 --> 46:15.809
- Stay together.
- Yeah.

46:27.644 --> 46:29.590
Nobody's here. It's just us.

46:41.892 --> 46:44.304
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

46:44.394 --> 46:45.896
Come on, stay together. Come on.

46:46.797 --> 46:49.243
- I hear something.
- Was that you?

46:50.934 --> 46:53.141
- My God. What is that?
- What's what?

46:53.237 --> 46:55.012
- I hear something.
- It's okay.

46:56.039 --> 46:57.245
Keep calm.

46:58.976 --> 47:01.582
Do you hear that?
What is that? I hear something.

47:02.079 --> 47:03.422
Just stay together.

47:08.685 --> 47:09.959
What?

47:20.164 --> 47:21.837
Someone is watching us.

47:22.666 --> 47:25.237
- My cell phone.
- Wait, wait, wait!

47:27.871 --> 47:29.976
Where is it? Shit.

48:05.375 --> 48:06.513
Jamie?

48:06.610 --> 48:07.919
What is that?

48:15.018 --> 48:16.429
Where is it?

48:18.689 --> 48:20.328
No, no, don't touch that! Don't touch that.

48:21.458 --> 48:24.064
Olivia, someone's planning this.

48:34.638 --> 48:36.675
"Kill or be killed."

48:37.574 --> 48:39.850
They want us to fight back.

48:43.881 --> 48:45.485
Careful!

48:45.983 --> 48:47.462
It works!

48:49.286 --> 48:50.856
What do we do?

48:50.954 --> 48:52.433
Oh, my God.

48:56.693 --> 48:58.229
Oh, my God!

49:13.510 --> 49:15.581
Just stay close, all right?

50:31.221 --> 50:32.700
What is that?

50:32.823 --> 50:34.530
It smells like gas.

51:38.755 --> 51:40.632
Where's Jamie?

51:40.724 --> 51:42.067
Jamie.

51:44.261 --> 51:45.604
Jamie, come here.

51:45.796 --> 51:48.106
- Come on. Get down, dude.
- Get down.

52:45.689 --> 52:48.067
Run. Run!

52:48.825 --> 52:50.080
- Adam!
- Dad!

52:50.160 --> 52:51.969
Go! Go! Go!

52:53.230 --> 52:55.267
We can't get out! We're trapped!

52:55.699 --> 52:57.269
He's here. Run!

52:58.135 --> 52:59.375
Go! Run!

53:01.705 --> 53:03.810
- No, back up!
- Olivia!

53:03.907 --> 53:06.114
Stay back! Get back in the basement!
Get back!

53:06.710 --> 53:09.020
- Olivia, come on, hurry! Olivia!
- Stay back!

53:16.353 --> 53:17.855
Shit, shit, shit...

53:17.954 --> 53:18.989
Okay, let me look.

53:21.391 --> 53:23.030
- Oh, my God, somebody...
- We need to get out of here.

53:23.160 --> 53:24.730
Somebody could be in here.

53:25.028 --> 53:27.270
No! No!

53:27.831 --> 53:29.208
It's locked!

53:29.299 --> 53:30.801
We have to try and find a way out of here.

53:31.401 --> 53:32.812
The windows!

53:34.738 --> 53:37.309
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- No...

53:39.176 --> 53:40.849
- Oh, my God.
- No...

53:40.944 --> 53:42.184
What are we gonna do?

53:42.679 --> 53:44.955
Find something to pry it open with.

54:03.400 --> 54:05.539
What? What is it?

54:11.775 --> 54:13.254
Was that your mother's?

54:23.119 --> 54:24.530
Help me!

54:25.388 --> 54:26.890
Damn it!

54:31.528 --> 54:34.168
It's okay.

54:34.531 --> 54:38.070
Guys? Do you guys hear that?

54:38.969 --> 54:42.610
- Guys, do you hear that?
- It's okay.

54:42.706 --> 54:44.276
It's the police!

54:44.374 --> 54:45.962
It's the police, guys!

54:46.042 --> 54:47.646
What?

54:48.078 --> 54:50.081
- Help us!
- We're in the basement!

54:50.480 --> 54:52.619
- Help us!
- We're in the basement!

54:52.716 --> 54:55.094
Down here! We're here!

54:55.919 --> 54:58.297
Downstairs in the basement!

54:58.455 --> 55:00.992
<i>This is the police. We've received
reports of a disturbance...</i>

55:01.224 --> 55:04.137
We're down here!

55:04.227 --> 55:05.968
- Downstairs!
- We're downstairs!

55:06.062 --> 55:07.564
- Wait.
- Help us!

55:09.733 --> 55:11.406
I hear them.

55:11.501 --> 55:14.949
- Hello! We're down here!
- Help us!

55:15.639 --> 55:18.347
- We're in the basement!
- Down here!

55:18.775 --> 55:21.565
Help!

55:21.645 --> 55:23.934
<i>This is the police. We've received
reports of a disturbance,</i>

55:24.014 --> 55:25.755
<i>and we're searching the home.</i>

55:25.982 --> 55:29.122
<i>This is the police. We've received
reports of a disturbance,</i>

55:29.252 --> 55:30.663
- <i>and we're searching the home.</i>
- I don't understand.

55:30.754 --> 55:34.031
<i>This is the police. We've received
reports of a disturbance...</i>

55:34.257 --> 55:37.136
<i>This is the police. We've received
reports of a disturbance...</i>

55:37.294 --> 55:41.140
<i>This is the police. We've received
reports of a disturbance...</i>

55:41.231 --> 55:42.437
<i>And we're searching the home.</i>

55:42.532 --> 55:44.910
- What is it?
- Speakers.

55:46.503 --> 55:48.506
They're screwing with us.

55:48.872 --> 55:51.148
They wanted us in the basement.

55:53.109 --> 55:54.986
We're all gonna die.

55:55.178 --> 55:56.933
Okay, listen to me, all right?

55:57.013 --> 56:00.461
I need you to be strong for me.
Can you do that?

56:02.018 --> 56:04.191
Can you be strong for your
brother and for me?

56:04.287 --> 56:05.732
Guys?

56:07.457 --> 56:08.868
I found this on the driveway.

56:09.859 --> 56:12.066
It had a bow on it, too.

56:58.074 --> 56:59.485
<i>Did you guys hear that?</i>

56:59.976 --> 57:01.922
- <i>What is it?</i>
- <i>It's coming from over here.</i>

57:16.526 --> 57:18.563
Oh, my God. Josh.

57:23.933 --> 57:25.378
- Go get him.
- Josh.

57:26.236 --> 57:28.375
Josh!

57:36.346 --> 57:37.620
Josh!

57:55.799 --> 57:57.176
Hello!

57:57.267 --> 57:58.940
- Where's he going?
- Jamie.

57:59.302 --> 58:00.924
- <i>Jamie, you okay?</i>
- Jamie...

58:01.004 --> 58:02.726
Josh, go around!

58:02.806 --> 58:04.581
Are you... Jamie, you down there?

58:04.707 --> 58:06.414
- I'm here!
- Jamie, what's happening?

58:06.743 --> 58:08.264
Jamie!

58:08.344 --> 58:10.483
- Josh, keep coming!
- <i>Trying to get this stupid door open.</i>

58:10.580 --> 58:13.236
Let's go, come on! Josh, look behind you!

58:13.316 --> 58:15.887
Why won't this stupid door open? Jamie!

58:17.320 --> 58:18.594
No!

58:19.122 --> 58:20.999
No, Josh!

58:22.826 --> 58:24.772
No!

58:28.565 --> 58:29.908
Josh!

58:32.836 --> 58:34.213
Josh!

58:37.373 --> 58:39.046
Why are you doing this?

58:43.313 --> 58:45.020
God damn you!

58:50.987 --> 58:52.796
Leave us alone!

58:59.796 --> 59:02.868
Help! Help us!

59:38.067 --> 59:39.239
Why?

59:47.510 --> 59:50.514
Guys, there's another window.

59:56.085 --> 59:58.930
- Guys!
- All right. Come on.

01:00:02.292 --> 01:00:03.566
Come on.

01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:09.405
- Olivia!
- Wait.

01:00:09.566 --> 01:00:11.773
- It's okay.
- Olivia, where are you going?

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.179
Okay, listen to me. All right.
I want you to be strong for me.

01:00:21.844 --> 01:00:25.168
We locked ourselves in here.
They can't get in here, okay?

01:00:25.248 --> 01:00:26.727
I'm gonna go outside and find some help.

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:29.760
It's gonna be fine. It's safe.
Just wait here.

01:00:29.852 --> 01:00:33.561
I promise, I'll come back. Okay?
I'll come back.

01:00:35.892 --> 01:00:36.971
Olivia!

01:01:01.751 --> 01:01:03.321
I'll come back for you both.

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:05.265
I promise.

01:01:25.675 --> 01:01:27.086
Are we gonna die?

01:01:36.519 --> 01:01:37.691
I don't know.

01:02:43.586 --> 01:02:46.931
- Oh, my God, you're alive.
- We have to...

01:02:47.023 --> 01:02:48.627
- Okay, wait, wait. Oh, God.
- Get out of here.

01:02:50.226 --> 01:02:53.639
- Come on.
- Hurry. Hurry. Pry it off.

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:57.443
Run! Run!

01:02:57.533 --> 01:02:59.809
Run! Get out!

01:03:39.275 --> 01:03:41.380
Wait! Help!

01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:43.212
Help!

01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:47.960
Come around back.

01:03:55.925 --> 01:03:57.029
Hello?

01:04:12.975 --> 01:04:14.284
Don't worry.

01:04:15.611 --> 01:04:17.784
She made it out. I know she did.

01:04:29.025 --> 01:04:31.471
DJ, you can still go to the bathroom.

01:04:33.629 --> 01:04:36.786
Don't worry. I'll keep a close watch.

01:04:36.866 --> 01:04:39.506
Just go use the sink.

01:04:42.171 --> 01:04:43.309
Okay.

01:05:41.764 --> 01:05:42.970
Jamie?

01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:48.742
Jamie.

01:05:50.673 --> 01:05:52.312
Jamie, the door's locked.

01:05:53.976 --> 01:05:55.285
I can't get out.

01:05:57.713 --> 01:05:59.590
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:06:00.516 --> 01:06:01.722
Jamie!

01:06:03.619 --> 01:06:05.428
I can't open the door.

01:06:06.222 --> 01:06:07.462
Jamie!

01:06:09.692 --> 01:06:10.762
What's happening?

01:06:16.532 --> 01:06:21.174
Jamie! Help!

01:06:22.738 --> 01:06:23.739
Shit.

01:07:50.693 --> 01:07:52.400
Who are you?

01:08:16.886 --> 01:08:18.991
- Fuck.
- You okay?

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:51.761
Okay. Come on.

01:09:22.585 --> 01:09:25.691
Jamie. Your arm. Come here.

01:10:31.754 --> 01:10:33.233
What is that?

01:10:33.489 --> 01:10:35.731
<i>I keep having this nightmare.</i>

01:10:37.493 --> 01:10:39.405
<i>It starts the same every night.</i>

01:10:39.728 --> 01:10:41.367
<i>There's a storm outside.</i>

01:10:41.463 --> 01:10:44.034
- <i>It's thunder and lightning and...</i>
- Stay here.

01:10:45.401 --> 01:10:47.404
<i>Then I get this feeling...</i>

01:10:47.736 --> 01:10:49.739
<i>That someone's watching me.</i>

01:10:50.539 --> 01:10:53.076
<i>When the lightning flashes, I can see her.</i>

01:10:54.009 --> 01:10:56.353
<i>She's laying on the kitchen table...</i>

01:10:57.546 --> 01:11:01.722
<i>And she's got a shroud over her...</i>

01:11:02.585 --> 01:11:05.794
<i>And I can see all these bugs,</i>

01:11:06.355 --> 01:11:10.360
<i>these spiders and cockroaches,
and they're just...</i>

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.203
<i>Eating away at her.</i>

01:11:25.908 --> 01:11:27.217
What is it?

01:11:30.079 --> 01:11:32.457
Olivia. No.

01:11:36.552 --> 01:11:37.826
What is it?

01:11:39.355 --> 01:11:41.544
Nothing. It's just a mannequin.

01:11:41.624 --> 01:11:43.661
They're just trying to scare us.

01:12:28.771 --> 01:12:30.580
It's my nightmare.

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:45.865
DJ, run!

01:12:46.355 --> 01:12:48.164
Come on! Let's go.

01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:53.496
It's okay. Don't look. Come on, go.

01:13:09.044 --> 01:13:10.785
Is he going to find us?

01:13:16.618 --> 01:13:18.222
Yes.

01:15:04.126 --> 01:15:05.765
Stay here.

01:15:53.342 --> 01:15:55.049
Who are you?

01:16:00.382 --> 01:16:02.589
Why are you doing this?

01:16:04.486 --> 01:16:08.730
<i>Because it's fun for them.</i>

01:16:10.726 --> 01:16:12.365
Fun for who?

01:16:14.162 --> 01:16:16.005
<i>The people watching.</i>

01:16:20.235 --> 01:16:22.157
Just tell me what you want.

01:16:22.237 --> 01:16:24.012
<i>To cut you open</i>

01:16:24.239 --> 01:16:27.880
<i>and see what's inside you.</i>

01:16:28.577 --> 01:16:32.184
<i>We've been watching you a long time.</i>

01:16:33.015 --> 01:16:35.461
<i>We know your darkest thoughts, Jamie.</i>

01:16:36.151 --> 01:16:39.690
<i>We see the anger you hold back.</i>

01:16:40.289 --> 01:16:43.464
<i>For your mother. Your father.</i>

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.235
<i>You used that to stay alive.</i>

01:16:48.864 --> 01:16:53.313
<i>And now we all want to see
how far that will take you.</i>

01:16:53.402 --> 01:16:56.992
<i>There's a shock value to that
that's endlessly entertaining.</i>

01:16:57.072 --> 01:16:59.848
- <i>I couldn't help it.</i>
- <i>I had to know how it ended.</i>

01:17:00.275 --> 01:17:02.050
<i>Use this gift, Jamie.</i>

01:17:02.878 --> 01:17:07.088
<i>The only way you're going
to survive is if you become</i>

01:17:07.616 --> 01:17:10.028
<i>the darkness inside you.</i>

01:17:13.055 --> 01:17:16.400
Please, whoever's watching this,

01:17:17.259 --> 01:17:20.263
please help us! We live at 2-1...

01:17:23.565 --> 01:17:24.976
...lane.

01:17:41.316 --> 01:17:43.990
Remember when you asked me
if we were gonna die?

01:17:45.354 --> 01:17:49.166
- And I said I didn't know.
- Yeah.

01:17:51.593 --> 01:17:53.266
I do know.

01:17:54.529 --> 01:17:58.773
The only other person who's gonna
die here tonight...

01:18:01.937 --> 01:18:03.473
Is him.

01:18:05.607 --> 01:18:07.849
- Listen to me.
- No, Jamie.

01:18:07.943 --> 01:18:10.014
- DJ, you have to trust me.
- No.

01:18:10.112 --> 01:18:12.183
It's okay. So this is what we're gonna do.

01:19:39.201 --> 01:19:42.808
Get the fuck out of our house.

01:19:56.084 --> 01:19:57.427
DJ, now!

01:20:04.559 --> 01:20:05.799
Come on, go on!

01:20:06.762 --> 01:20:07.832
DJ!

01:20:30.819 --> 01:20:32.594
Get off of me!

01:20:46.968 --> 01:20:48.038
Jamie!

01:20:48.603 --> 01:20:50.105
Get off of her!

01:20:51.239 --> 01:20:52.650
Jamie!

01:21:00.315 --> 01:21:03.319
Jamie! No!

01:21:17.599 --> 01:21:20.011
Burn in hell, fucker!

01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:28.980
Okay, DJ, help me. Come on!

01:21:40.322 --> 01:21:42.359
Come on! DJ, let's go!

01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:57.993
Come on, Jamie, come on.

01:21:58.073 --> 01:22:00.076
- We're almost there.
- I can't keep going.

01:22:00.175 --> 01:22:02.631
I don't think anyone's coming.
It's okay. Come on.

01:22:02.711 --> 01:22:05.191
- I can't do it.
- All right, come on.

01:22:06.681 --> 01:22:07.682
Come on, Jamie.

01:22:09.417 --> 01:22:10.418
Stop!

01:22:11.419 --> 01:22:13.865
Come on.

01:22:14.756 --> 01:22:17.293
- Come here! No! Stop!
- Please!

01:22:27.502 --> 01:22:28.537
Get off!

01:22:29.404 --> 01:22:31.247
DJ, look out!

01:22:35.543 --> 01:22:39.423
No, please! Jamie!

01:22:45.587 --> 01:22:48.693
DJ! Are you okay?

01:22:49.524 --> 01:22:50.969
I'm fine.

01:22:55.964 --> 01:22:57.637
Leave us alone!

01:22:57.732 --> 01:23:00.088
Why are you doing this to us?

01:23:00.168 --> 01:23:02.444
<i>Why are you doing this to us?</i>

01:23:02.537 --> 01:23:04.744
<i>Why are you doing this to us?</i>

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.950
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

01:23:17.118 --> 01:23:20.156
<i>The rules have always been very simple.</i>

01:23:20.588 --> 01:23:21.965
What is this?

01:23:22.424 --> 01:23:26.167
<i>Kill or be killed.</i>

01:23:43.445 --> 01:23:46.483
<i>It's your turn now, Jamie.</i>

01:23:48.516 --> 01:23:52.487
<i>We're not going to hurt your brother...</i>

01:23:52.587 --> 01:23:56.228
<i>As long as you do exactly what I tell you.</i>

01:23:56.858 --> 01:23:59.236
Don't listen to him, Jamie.

01:24:00.528 --> 01:24:03.532
<i>You will provide the excitement</i>

01:24:03.631 --> 01:24:06.305
<i>for our next family, Jamie.</i>

01:24:10.505 --> 01:24:14.476
<i>You will give the audience the reason</i>

01:24:20.949 --> 01:24:23.429
<i>to keep watching.</i>
