00:34.570 --> 00:37.740
May Song dynasty endure 10,000 years.

01:03.683 --> 01:05.184
Out of the way.

03:52.392 --> 03:54.687
There were separate explosions.

03:54.770 --> 03:57.273
Five rebels killed over 300 Mongols.

03:57.356 --> 03:59.358
The injured number in the thousands.

03:59.442 --> 04:01.652
- How long ago?
- Three days.

04:02.570 --> 04:05.072
And we have no idea
if there have been any more attacks?

04:06.365 --> 04:09.952
I've augmented the number of scouts
riding between the south and Cambulac,

04:10.035 --> 04:12.037
in the hopes of receiving word
in a timelier fashion.

04:12.705 --> 04:14.164
I will redirect our armies south.

04:14.248 --> 04:17.250
Command them to attack hard and fast.

04:17.334 --> 04:21.130
I'm not certain starting a war
will ease tensions.

04:21.213 --> 04:22.422
I said nothing of war.

04:24.091 --> 04:26.886
I speak of complete annihilation.
Make a statement.

04:26.969 --> 04:30.347
And I believe the last statement you made
led us here.

04:30.430 --> 04:34.393
The plan was for your army to
accompany you to Xanadu as protection...

04:34.477 --> 04:35.853
and a show of force.

04:36.854 --> 04:38.856
Realities change.

04:38.939 --> 04:40.399
Plans change.

04:41.316 --> 04:43.611
I stay.
To stamp out this insurrection.

04:44.904 --> 04:48.448
As Vice Regent,
you have entrusted me with your army.

04:49.449 --> 04:51.994
Do so now.
I will not disappoint you.

04:53.704 --> 04:55.289
Travel to Xanadu, Great Khan.

04:55.372 --> 04:58.417
Make Kaidu regret
his challenge to your throne.

05:04.715 --> 05:08.886
Make them regret ever raising a hand
in defiance to their Khan and Emperor.

05:27.446 --> 05:29.156
You've overstepped your bounds.

05:30.490 --> 05:33.285
If you seek power, find it elsewhere.
You have none here.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.706
I do the bidding of the Khan, Ahmad.

05:38.373 --> 05:39.750
My name is not Ahmad.

05:39.834 --> 05:41.210
Not to you.

05:42.336 --> 05:44.254
It is Vice Regent.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.884
Attempt to undermine me
or go behind my back...

05:51.053 --> 05:52.262
Well...

05:58.894 --> 06:00.270
You honor me, Great Khan.

06:03.357 --> 06:05.567
And you dishonor me.

06:06.861 --> 06:09.113
You want to be a tax collector.

06:09.196 --> 06:11.573
This is your aspiration in life...

06:11.657 --> 06:13.993
when I offer you
the Ministry of Finance?

06:15.035 --> 06:17.955
In order to one day
be of true service to the Empire,

06:18.038 --> 06:20.457
I must first learn
the fundamentals of finance.

06:20.540 --> 06:21.917
Nonsense.

06:22.668 --> 06:25.504
Since you were small,
your aptitude with numbers

06:25.587 --> 06:28.173
has outshone men 20 years your senior.

06:28.257 --> 06:29.299
Mmm.

06:29.383 --> 06:33.303
And consorting with commoners
will not further you in that regard.

06:33.387 --> 06:36.181
Nor will living below your expectations.

06:36.265 --> 06:39.101
And throwing our rewards back in our face.

06:39.184 --> 06:42.146
To rule well,
one must know the people he rules.

06:42.229 --> 06:43.563
This is my goal...

06:44.649 --> 06:46.483
given me by my wise
and powerful parents.

06:48.235 --> 06:51.113
You are stubborn.

06:51.196 --> 06:52.281
Which is good.

06:52.364 --> 06:55.701
And clearly care nothing
of the comforts I have provided you.

06:55.785 --> 06:57.202
Which is good as well.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.877
I respect your determination.

07:05.795 --> 07:06.837
Do as you wish...

07:07.755 --> 07:09.757
but return to us a better man.

07:12.635 --> 07:13.761
Yes, Father.

07:13.844 --> 07:15.638
And do not think only of work and duty.

07:15.721 --> 07:17.890
Explore the riches of my Silk Road.

07:18.849 --> 07:21.351
Savor the local flavors

07:21.435 --> 07:23.270
- when so inclined.

07:27.399 --> 07:29.151
I'll miss you, son.

07:29.944 --> 07:31.320
And I, you, Mother.

07:36.450 --> 07:37.743
Hmm.

07:40.412 --> 07:42.372
Kublai was on our land,

07:42.456 --> 07:44.374
surrounded by our army,
your blade to his throat,

07:44.458 --> 07:45.960
and you let him ride away.

07:46.043 --> 07:47.627
What was I to do?
Start an all-out war?

07:47.712 --> 07:50.214
Slaughter him.
Slaughter his children.

07:50.297 --> 07:52.091
Burn his city to the ground.

07:52.174 --> 07:55.385
Rip the Khanate from him.
There would not have been a war.

07:55.469 --> 07:58.138
It's because of your advice
and my dim-witted son

07:58.222 --> 08:00.432
the chieftains will pledge
their support to Kublai.

08:00.515 --> 08:02.142
Take their support back.

08:03.310 --> 08:06.105
Stop concerning yourself
with an honorable victory.

08:06.188 --> 08:08.482
Stop scrambling to name heirs.

08:08.565 --> 08:09.817
I don't want it.

08:11.151 --> 08:12.945
Give it to Orus.

08:13.028 --> 08:14.071
I agree.

08:14.154 --> 08:15.280
It will never happen, ever!

08:16.949 --> 08:19.201
This is over.
Everyone but my daughter, out.

08:21.036 --> 08:22.287
Get out.

08:33.465 --> 08:35.174
I don't care what you want.

08:36.342 --> 08:39.054
You will be the first
female Khan of Mongolia.

08:40.054 --> 08:41.932
I gave up everything for you.

08:42.850 --> 08:44.393
My life...

08:44.476 --> 08:45.519
your mother.

08:45.602 --> 08:47.187
That's not my burden.

08:47.271 --> 08:49.398
Is this punishment?
For Byamba?

08:49.481 --> 08:51.859
I think you wanted
him to react the way he did.

08:51.942 --> 08:53.235
You wanted him gone.

08:53.318 --> 08:55.612
What purpose would that serve?

08:55.695 --> 08:57.197
His support serviced my needs.

08:57.281 --> 08:58.657
Don't remind me!

08:58.741 --> 09:02.953
When I told you to get close to the Khan,
you chose the path.

09:03.037 --> 09:05.372
You chose Byamba, not me.

09:05.455 --> 09:07.249
And you used it to your advantage.

09:07.332 --> 09:08.583
Of course I did!

09:08.667 --> 09:12.337
That's one of many reasons
I will not be your heir.

09:12.421 --> 09:15.382
I don't want to do things like that
to the people I love.

09:15.465 --> 09:17.760
And I won't allow you to do them to me.

09:28.813 --> 09:32.107
You were supposed to get their votes,
not uproot me!

09:32.191 --> 09:33.901
Be careful with that!

09:34.526 --> 09:36.987
-Promising me to others like a whore!
-Father...

09:37.071 --> 09:39.656
Thanks to Genghis
and his damned Kurultai,

09:39.739 --> 09:42.617
we travel hither and thither
begging for approval.

09:42.701 --> 09:45.704
- But, Sire...
- Judge me by my actions, and Kaidu by his.

09:45.788 --> 09:48.290
- What he did to my sons.
- Father, if you just...

09:48.373 --> 09:49.666
What's done is done.

09:49.749 --> 09:51.626
We throw a banquet, have a hunt.

09:51.710 --> 09:54.839
Smack the chieftains into line,
return home, victory in hand.

09:54.922 --> 09:56.924
Very wise, Father.

09:57.007 --> 10:00.469
Don't. Don't do that.
I want to be bitter.

10:04.764 --> 10:06.100
I'm going to go.

10:17.694 --> 10:19.071
Did you know about this?

10:19.989 --> 10:21.615
You're going to make me read it?

10:21.698 --> 10:24.284
It's Byamba's military assignment...

10:24.368 --> 10:25.619
as foot soldier.

10:26.245 --> 10:27.579
You removed that from my desk.

10:29.498 --> 10:32.001
-I did.
-You had no right.

10:32.084 --> 10:34.253
- "Greetings, Great Khan."
- Apologies.

10:34.336 --> 10:35.963
Greetings, Great Khan.

10:39.674 --> 10:41.635
You requested I find
a suitable station for him.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.180
The men in his tumen do not trust him.

10:45.264 --> 10:46.640
I thought working his way
through the ranks

10:46.723 --> 10:48.308
might earn their respect once again.

10:48.392 --> 10:50.227
Shouldn't Byamba travel with us?

10:50.310 --> 10:52.437
Let the chieftains see
he has abandoned Kaidu

10:52.521 --> 10:53.688
and stands with his father.

10:53.772 --> 10:56.400
Having him by your side right now
is not a good idea.

10:56.483 --> 10:57.526
He's his son, Ahmad.

10:57.609 --> 10:59.862
And they'll wonder whose side
he'll cozy up to tomorrow.

10:59.945 --> 11:01.738
Enough! Both of you.

11:02.697 --> 11:06.035
I asked him to find a position for Byamba.
He did.

11:06.118 --> 11:07.619
Give him back his paper!

11:19.924 --> 11:22.426
You'll be missed
while we're in Xanadu.

11:22.509 --> 11:25.095
Someone must watch over Cambulac.

11:26.221 --> 11:29.433
- The quiet will allow me to convalesce.
- Hmm.

11:29.516 --> 11:31.226
Find Nayan.
Send him to me.

11:32.144 --> 11:33.562
You're concerned about his support?

11:33.645 --> 11:35.397
No. Never.

11:36.315 --> 11:37.816
He was in Karakorum with Kaidu.

11:37.899 --> 11:39.193
He's honorable.

11:40.110 --> 11:42.904
Believes all men deserve
a chance to be heard.

11:44.406 --> 11:45.615
But he hates Kaidu.

11:46.533 --> 11:47.826
Fortunate for us.

11:47.909 --> 11:51.580
Yeah, but the other chieftains
must hear him say it.

11:57.669 --> 11:59.588
Nayan arrives here in three weeks.

11:59.671 --> 12:00.714
Hmm.

12:00.797 --> 12:04.384
It is auspicious timing,
with Kublai headed to Xanadu.

12:05.135 --> 12:08.763
You and I both know
Nayan won't swear his allegiance to Kaidu.

12:08.847 --> 12:10.057
Not willingly.

12:11.475 --> 12:13.102
But given enough incentive...

12:13.185 --> 12:16.646
every man's will becomes flexible.

12:24.446 --> 12:26.115
Gimping around the palace must...

12:27.032 --> 12:29.368
be a prerequisite
for the duties of this office.

12:30.285 --> 12:31.953
Be grateful you're alive.

12:38.168 --> 12:41.005
I was dying in that shit-infested cave...

12:42.756 --> 12:44.508
and I thought of you.

12:48.053 --> 12:49.471
I know that look.

12:50.847 --> 12:51.931
All too well.

12:53.933 --> 12:58.813
It's of a man trying to win my affections
after he's already bought me.

12:59.439 --> 13:00.899
I haven't paid you a thing.

13:01.566 --> 13:06.030
You've paid me in the one thing
no man has been able to.

13:07.906 --> 13:09.199
Hope...

13:09.991 --> 13:11.868
for a future with my daughter.

13:13.912 --> 13:15.664
Did you enjoy seeing her?

13:20.960 --> 13:22.296
And...

13:22.379 --> 13:23.922
as your Empress.

13:24.005 --> 13:26.341
I haven't chosen an Empress yet.

13:28.218 --> 13:29.303
I will...

13:31.180 --> 13:33.182
- ...be your Empress.

13:47.487 --> 13:49.906
I thought we might
hunt together in Xanadu.

13:50.574 --> 13:52.201
I'm on a different kind of hunt.

13:52.992 --> 13:54.703
Then may heaven help the south.

13:55.995 --> 13:57.289
Form up!

14:02.127 --> 14:05.214
You should be leading this tumen.

14:06.423 --> 14:08.007
My father knows best.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.677
Ahmad demoted you.

14:16.475 --> 14:18.227
He serves my father.
Same difference.

14:18.977 --> 14:21.396
I attempted to change the Khan's mind,
but...

14:21.480 --> 14:23.148
It's fine, Marco.

14:23.232 --> 14:26.151
I imagine it's comforting to follow
for a little while.

14:26.776 --> 14:29.988
March, sleep, fight, kill.
Simple.

14:30.072 --> 14:32.574
Move out!

14:32.657 --> 14:34.868
This is where I can serve...

14:34.951 --> 14:37.246
what I do best,
what I enjoy the most.

14:37.996 --> 14:39.373
Oh, Bastard-Prince!

14:43.918 --> 14:45.629
Or something like this.

14:46.796 --> 14:50.550
If I take an arrow in the back,
interrogate him before the Song, will you?

14:50.634 --> 14:53.970
Take care of yourself, Byamba.

14:54.929 --> 14:56.556
Take care of my father.

15:13.907 --> 15:15.909
He has a report for you, my lord.

15:25.169 --> 15:26.420
Get on with it.

15:32.050 --> 15:34.803
My station is at the Princess' door.

15:35.554 --> 15:37.597
We have many princesses.

15:37.681 --> 15:40.934
Prince Jingim's recently seeded
fourth wife.

15:42.186 --> 15:43.228
And?

15:44.146 --> 15:47.566
I escorted a stable hand
into her bedroom...

15:47.649 --> 15:50.610
at an inappropriate hour, and...

15:50.694 --> 15:53.697
at Empress Chabi's command.

16:09.338 --> 16:10.964
May I offer you a drink?

16:26.521 --> 16:28.440
-Mother.
-Shh.

16:38.157 --> 16:40.785
Auli Burkhan.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.258
Apologies, Empress.

16:54.341 --> 16:57.886
Auli Burkhan won't say
the sex of the child.

16:59.263 --> 17:00.347
Won't say?

17:03.016 --> 17:04.309
Make her say.

17:10.064 --> 17:12.733
...Auli Burkhan,

17:12.817 --> 17:15.194
Auli Burkhan.

17:17.821 --> 17:19.532
I'm sorry, Empress.

17:20.492 --> 17:21.910
She sees nothing.

17:23.077 --> 17:24.704
She sees nothing?

17:25.829 --> 17:27.749
What does it mean, Mother?

17:27.832 --> 17:30.043
It can take time to determine sex.

17:31.378 --> 17:34.839
What if this baby isn't a boy?
What will happen then?

17:34.923 --> 17:36.550
Nothing will happen.

17:36.633 --> 17:38.843
It's a boy until proven otherwise.

17:39.886 --> 17:41.054
Do you think she knows?

17:42.931 --> 17:45.224
Who? Knows what?

17:45.309 --> 17:46.726
The bariyachi.

17:47.727 --> 17:48.895
About the baby...

17:50.689 --> 17:51.773
It isn't Jingim's.

17:59.906 --> 18:01.199
Kokachin.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.036
Sorry, Mother.

18:05.829 --> 18:07.956
We'll speak of this baby

18:08.039 --> 18:09.624
only as a holy blessing

18:09.708 --> 18:13.378
and harbinger of joy.
Do you understand?

18:14.087 --> 18:15.589
Yes, Mother.

18:46.870 --> 18:48.037
There you are.

18:51.375 --> 18:52.709
Here I am.

18:54.711 --> 18:57.005
There's been an attack in the south.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.424
Many were killed.

19:00.842 --> 19:02.552
I have to send my army.

19:03.553 --> 19:06.723
They won't be accompanying us
to Xanadu as I'd hoped.

19:14.898 --> 19:16.441
I'm not going to Xanadu.

19:19.361 --> 19:20.529
You're not?

19:22.113 --> 19:23.865
Kokachin shouldn't travel.

19:24.574 --> 19:26.576
The pregnancy must not be risked.

19:27.911 --> 19:29.663
My place is here with her.

19:33.082 --> 19:35.251
And what of your husband?

19:35.334 --> 19:36.586
What of him?

19:37.837 --> 19:39.631
Have you no place by him?

19:48.682 --> 19:52.185
My husband has
no further need of my advice.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.897
He has no further need of me.

20:50.201 --> 20:51.911
Hello, Nergüi.

20:51.995 --> 20:53.204
It's been a long time.

20:59.669 --> 21:01.045
Lady Kokachin.

21:09.888 --> 21:11.848
I was certain it was a mortal wound.

21:12.891 --> 21:14.601
I would imagine so.

21:16.019 --> 21:17.854
How else could you have managed this?

21:18.813 --> 21:22.108
From peasant to princess overnight.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.239
How did you survive?

21:28.322 --> 21:30.199
A group of villagers found me.

21:31.701 --> 21:35.413
They brought me to a shaman,
and he somehow stemmed the bleeding.

21:48.718 --> 21:50.344
I looked and looked for you.

21:51.304 --> 21:53.139
But you were gone.

21:53.222 --> 21:55.934
Not a trace.
Not a whisper.

21:58.269 --> 22:00.396
Then I heard the news.

22:00.479 --> 22:04.233
Prince Jingim is to wed the Blue Princess,

22:04.317 --> 22:06.986
last survivor of the Bayaut tribe.

22:07.987 --> 22:09.698
That's how I found you.

22:11.991 --> 22:13.326
And look at you.

22:14.285 --> 22:17.330
You have everything
a princess could ever want.

22:20.458 --> 22:22.210
I want my life back.

22:25.463 --> 22:27.048
Jingim's married to me.

22:28.549 --> 22:30.134
This is my baby.

22:31.928 --> 22:34.013
You found a way to take it.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.977
Now find a way...

22:39.060 --> 22:40.854
to give it back.

23:12.218 --> 23:13.803
If it flowed still...

23:15.429 --> 23:17.473
airag, or boal, or wine, or mead...

23:18.266 --> 23:20.059
no warrior could stop me.

23:21.686 --> 23:24.898
I'd chase the Khanate as rabidly
as my daughter runs from it.

23:27.066 --> 23:31.279
Some are either too simple
or too weak-willed to take what is theirs.

23:31.362 --> 23:32.613
It isn't worth it.

23:33.614 --> 23:35.449
I set out to have it on my own terms,

23:35.533 --> 23:37.118
and if I cannot,

23:37.201 --> 23:38.745
the Khanate is not worth it.

23:39.370 --> 23:40.664
I can concede it.

23:41.539 --> 23:44.167
I cannot concede my family.

23:56.012 --> 23:58.306
And if I can give you both?

24:21.454 --> 24:22.956
Just one more, son.

24:25.959 --> 24:29.838
You bear the burden
of a long line of weak and worthless men.

24:30.839 --> 24:34.383
These demons must be
drawn to the surface and expelled.

24:56.239 --> 24:57.406
I'm not my father...

24:58.407 --> 25:00.034
nor his father...

25:03.037 --> 25:05.164
I'm not my father.

25:05.706 --> 25:09.043
Nor his father,
or his father before him.

25:10.378 --> 25:11.921
I'm not my father...

25:12.005 --> 25:13.339
nor his father...

25:14.298 --> 25:15.884
or his father before him.

25:15.967 --> 25:19.846
Yet still so far from greatness.

25:36.320 --> 25:39.157
May the impotent forefathers
of the House of Ögödei

25:39.240 --> 25:42.701
- be expelled from this broken vessel.

25:54.881 --> 25:58.259
May the deer of the past
become the wolves of the present.

25:58.342 --> 26:00.678
Through your suffering...

26:00.761 --> 26:05.433
may you rise to wear
the black sable of Genghis Khan.

26:06.642 --> 26:09.562
Chaos. A most wonderful weapon.

26:11.272 --> 26:13.774
Only takes a little push
to upend the cart.

26:14.733 --> 26:16.903
Hundreds of Kublai's men are dead.

26:17.528 --> 26:19.405
I wouldn't call that...

26:19.488 --> 26:20.739
a little push.

26:21.657 --> 26:25.328
With his troops waging war
in the south, the Khan is vulnerable.

26:25.411 --> 26:29.123
Our forces will strike Kublai dead
at a time of our choosing.

26:33.794 --> 26:35.671
I have another problem.

26:35.754 --> 26:37.131
What's that?

26:37.215 --> 26:38.257
Marco.

26:39.633 --> 26:41.552
He's in my affairs.

26:41.635 --> 26:44.973
He's become a nuisance, and nuisances
are the first to be swatted dead.

26:45.723 --> 26:47.725
He seems beneath you, no?

26:48.893 --> 26:50.228
Are you protecting him?

26:52.105 --> 26:54.440
I'm lauding you.

27:03.366 --> 27:04.450
Now...

27:05.952 --> 27:07.703
on your knees.

27:13.126 --> 27:14.543
I can't.

27:14.627 --> 27:15.879
Get up.

27:30.434 --> 27:31.810
Look at me.

27:38.484 --> 27:40.778
Perhaps you'll get rid
of the Latin for me.

27:46.284 --> 27:47.660
Perhaps I will.

27:55.293 --> 27:56.794
But for now...

27:58.796 --> 28:00.548
let me take care of you.

28:47.886 --> 28:50.014
You've got a funny face already!

28:53.726 --> 28:56.145
So... hands up.

28:58.982 --> 29:00.649
And then like this.

29:10.701 --> 29:11.910
Master Ahmad.

29:13.746 --> 29:15.206
You honor us.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.584
I honored you with time.

29:18.667 --> 29:20.628
I trust it's allowed you
to fill your coffers.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.048
Bad news, Master A.

29:24.132 --> 29:26.009
We find ourselves here again?

29:26.092 --> 29:27.135
Girls get sick.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.887
Hazard of the occupation.

29:29.971 --> 29:33.141
Patrons don't declare,
and the girls are left to pay.

29:33.224 --> 29:37.020
I'm all sympathy, Madame, but the debt
won't hide itself in my ledgers.

29:38.896 --> 29:40.731
Perhaps it could...

29:40.814 --> 29:45.278
if you were properly motivated.

29:52.451 --> 29:54.620
You wish to spread disease
as far as Cambulac?

29:54.703 --> 29:59.250
These three are 100% guaranteed well.

29:59.333 --> 30:00.584
Very well.

30:05.131 --> 30:06.174
Fresh...

30:07.175 --> 30:08.967
and nimble.

30:15.891 --> 30:18.061
Very highly skilled.

30:24.567 --> 30:28.362
Well, that leaves us with number three.

30:35.536 --> 30:36.912
Look...

30:37.455 --> 30:38.789
you're a match.

30:40.708 --> 30:41.875
Very lucky.

30:45.338 --> 30:47.048
Oksana it is, then.

30:51.635 --> 30:55.348
Six tumen descend on the south,
and are on pace to arrive

30:55.431 --> 30:57.725
and support their brothers
in a week's time.

30:58.767 --> 31:00.436
Sixty thousand men?

31:05.149 --> 31:07.610
How many are left
to escort me to Xanadu?

31:07.693 --> 31:09.362
Seven mingghans, Sire.

31:10.071 --> 31:13.031
Seven thousand are traveling with me?

31:13.116 --> 31:15.118
That's not a show of force.
That's a party.

31:15.701 --> 31:18.579
It is not a concern, Sire.
You will travel in safety.

31:19.788 --> 31:20.831
Hmm.

31:20.914 --> 31:23.417
When we have finished
putting down the rebellion,

31:23.501 --> 31:26.795
I will send everyone I can to Karakorum
in time for the Kurultai.

31:27.630 --> 31:29.590
-That's when you'll need them.
-Hmm.

31:35.053 --> 31:37.598
Your mother has chosen to stay behind.

31:41.144 --> 31:42.728
Pack up your whore.

31:42.811 --> 31:44.730
She's coming to Xanadu with me.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.402
My whore?

31:49.485 --> 31:50.528
Mei Lin?

31:52.113 --> 31:56.742
For all her faults as assassin
and procreator of my enemies...

31:56.825 --> 32:01.747
she has an uncommon way
of keeping my mind clear of late.

32:05.959 --> 32:07.085
Sire.

32:17.513 --> 32:19.307
Who's on your mind, Polo?

32:22.059 --> 32:23.686
- Sanga.

32:25.729 --> 32:28.941
Why would a long-dead taxman
be vexing you now?

32:29.858 --> 32:31.319
He worked for Ahmad.

32:32.278 --> 32:35.864
And we never discovered who arranged
for the assassination of Kublai.

32:42.538 --> 32:44.707
Yusuf confessed in his own hand.

32:45.333 --> 32:47.251
You don't believe that.

32:51.004 --> 32:53.299
Continue with your speculation.

32:54.508 --> 32:56.969
Ahmad ordered
the entire army south,

32:57.052 --> 33:00.055
while the Khan rides north
with little protection.

33:01.224 --> 33:03.392
He advised execution
of the Boy Emperor.

33:03.476 --> 33:06.645
He demoted Byamba
for no apparent reason.

33:07.813 --> 33:09.857
He threatened my life.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.400
He threatened your life?

33:11.484 --> 33:13.444
Not in so many words, but...

33:13.527 --> 33:16.113
the implication was clear.

33:24.372 --> 33:28.542
So you condemn Ahmad's innuendo,
but pardon Yusuf's writing?

33:30.503 --> 33:33.381
He is the Khan's son, raised from boyhood.

33:33.464 --> 33:36.300
You are a foreigner, raised by nobody.

33:36.384 --> 33:37.968
It's a feeling, Sifu.

33:39.803 --> 33:41.722
And you've trained me to trust in them.

33:42.681 --> 33:44.225
Should I simply ignore it?

33:45.351 --> 33:46.602
Do nothing?

33:49.605 --> 33:52.733
The sage acts by doing nothing.

33:54.818 --> 33:57.363
You... are not a sage.

34:07.665 --> 34:09.583
You shouldn't be here.

34:12.295 --> 34:15.964
Before we returned to Cambulac,
you thought the Emperor might die.

34:16.047 --> 34:18.091
I presented it as a possibility.

34:19.134 --> 34:22.219
You knew Ahmad would
advise the Khan to execute that boy.

34:22.304 --> 34:23.389
I knew no such thing.

34:23.472 --> 34:25.139
It was an educated guess.

34:28.185 --> 34:30.103
He wanted the boy dead.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.190
Was it to incite war?

34:35.192 --> 34:39.447
The Vice Regent doesn't share
his political or military ruminations

34:39.530 --> 34:42.239
with the woman
who tried to kill his mother.

34:43.784 --> 34:44.952
You're lying.

34:45.911 --> 34:47.204
You're too smart.

34:48.621 --> 34:51.458
You've lived here too long
not to have any insight.

34:55.045 --> 34:56.630
When we returned from the south

34:56.714 --> 34:59.007
and stood before the Khan
in the throne room...

35:00.092 --> 35:01.719
you spoke of my honor.

35:02.803 --> 35:04.137
You defended me.

35:05.306 --> 35:06.932
Now I wish to repay you.

35:07.891 --> 35:09.393
Take your questions...

35:10.353 --> 35:11.854
take your suspicions...

35:12.813 --> 35:14.398
turn...

35:14.482 --> 35:16.692
and leave this place.

35:23.991 --> 35:26.284
Dark days will soon be behind us.

35:27.786 --> 35:30.414
The words of a fool.

35:31.374 --> 35:35.461
Or of a man who has been
filled with life by facing death.

35:35.544 --> 35:37.421
Death faces us.

35:37.505 --> 35:39.548
No matter how we try to look away.

35:41.299 --> 35:43.469
Your optimism smooths the road ahead.

35:48.766 --> 35:50.559
It's what makes us human...

35:53.979 --> 35:57.525
thinking we are administrators
of the fates.

35:59.943 --> 36:01.362
What's wrong?

36:08.160 --> 36:10.037
Perhaps, talk to your husband.

36:11.288 --> 36:14.082
He's never been
interested in talking to me

36:14.166 --> 36:16.544
about anything that hasn't concerned him.

36:19.254 --> 36:23.300
And now, not even that.

36:28.972 --> 36:32.142
So that's why he's taking
the whore with him to Xanadu...

36:33.351 --> 36:34.645
in your stead.

36:42.736 --> 36:44.697
She's a second-rate replacement.

36:50.202 --> 36:52.996
The Khan needs you
more than anyone else...

36:53.956 --> 36:55.624
especially in this moment.

36:57.125 --> 36:58.210
Hmm?

36:59.336 --> 37:00.838
Remember that, Mother.

38:18.624 --> 38:21.459
- How long have I slept?
- An hour.

38:23.587 --> 38:25.047
I must get back to work.

38:25.130 --> 38:26.715
Just relax.

38:31.094 --> 38:32.555
I'm glad you rested.

38:33.639 --> 38:34.848
You needed it.

38:36.141 --> 38:37.685
I like taking care of you.

38:39.728 --> 38:42.940
- You're from the kingdom of Bukhara, yes?

38:43.023 --> 38:44.066
I am.

38:44.650 --> 38:45.901
What village?

38:47.319 --> 38:48.821
There's nothing left of them now.

38:49.780 --> 38:50.906
Your family?

38:52.407 --> 38:53.576
Gone.

38:54.577 --> 38:56.369
You mean dead?

38:58.747 --> 39:00.290
What's the difference in the end?

39:02.084 --> 39:04.377
My husband, my little boy...

39:05.337 --> 39:06.463
they're dead...

39:07.422 --> 39:09.007
at the hands of your master.

39:10.008 --> 39:11.760
He put me here.

39:11.844 --> 39:15.472
I wasn't good enough for his harem,
so he sold me off to this place.

39:18.892 --> 39:20.268
At the time I was scared...

39:21.228 --> 39:23.521
angry, alone.

39:24.857 --> 39:27.525
And then I realized, I wasn't alone.

39:29.612 --> 39:31.071
They're here with me.

39:32.197 --> 39:33.240
Inside.

39:34.074 --> 39:35.117
Always.

39:37.410 --> 39:40.706
Surely, you have good memories, huh?

40:11.444 --> 40:13.196
That song...

40:15.741 --> 40:17.034
how do you know it?

40:18.035 --> 40:19.620
I wrote it...

40:19.703 --> 40:21.038
for my baby boy.

40:35.510 --> 40:37.554
...Did you fuck the Khan?

40:37.638 --> 40:39.765
-Get your hands off me.
-Did you fuck him?

40:39.848 --> 40:41.684
Remove them or I will.

40:51.735 --> 40:53.236
What would you have had me do?

40:53.320 --> 40:54.529
Deny him?

40:55.823 --> 40:59.159
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Is that what maddens you...

40:59.242 --> 41:00.327
lack of information?

41:00.410 --> 41:03.205
Not the fact that he stained my body
with his sweat and seed?

41:03.288 --> 41:04.915
All of it maddens me!

41:10.963 --> 41:13.256
If we're taking this opportunity...

41:14.382 --> 41:18.261
to unburden ourselves
of our lies of omission...

41:21.056 --> 41:22.850
well, I have one to share.

41:23.600 --> 41:27.187
Your daughter will no longer reside
in the House of Kublai.

41:29.773 --> 41:33.443
For in the days ahead...
I will use her as a bargaining chip.

41:40.743 --> 41:42.535
Bargaining chip for whom?

41:44.830 --> 41:46.331
- Who?

41:52.504 --> 41:54.506
For a man...

41:54.589 --> 41:58.176
with a predilection for unsoiled flesh.

41:59.803 --> 42:03.098
For a man who can
tip the scales of this Kurultai...

42:04.099 --> 42:07.019
in any direction I please.

42:07.102 --> 42:08.270
Nayan.

42:10.188 --> 42:12.190
My daughter is Nayan's incentive.

42:29.457 --> 42:31.084
You attempt to wound me?

42:33.128 --> 42:34.379
Ahmad...

42:36.548 --> 42:38.716
this is everything we've ever wanted.

42:40.593 --> 42:42.554
There is no worse man...

42:43.721 --> 42:46.934
for my daughter to be enslaved to
than the Khan.

42:49.895 --> 42:53.481
And if this is what it takes
to ensure he falls...

42:58.904 --> 43:00.197
so be it.

43:03.325 --> 43:05.743
I believed you.

43:07.329 --> 43:09.747
I actually believed, for a second,

43:09.832 --> 43:12.584
that you would sell
your most valuable possession.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.546
You're talented, Mei Lin...

43:18.048 --> 43:20.133
but not that talented.

43:40.487 --> 43:42.197
Hey, boy, give me some water.

44:03.927 --> 44:05.095
You're headed west?

44:06.054 --> 44:07.514
That's right.

44:07.597 --> 44:09.599
Coming from Quinsai?

44:09.682 --> 44:11.059
Yeah.

44:29.494 --> 44:30.703
Enough!

44:33.456 --> 44:36.626
No time for bathing, Bastard-Prince.

44:38.045 --> 44:39.629
We have a war to fight.

44:41.381 --> 44:42.549
Move out!

44:54.394 --> 44:55.728
Yes, sir.

46:07.634 --> 46:09.011
I want to water my horse.

46:09.094 --> 46:12.264
That water belongs to the Khan, Kublai...
Princess.

47:16.786 --> 47:18.996
Are you ready to listen to your mother?

47:25.420 --> 47:26.504
Yes.

47:40.185 --> 47:42.019
- I've fulfilled my part of the bargain.

47:43.020 --> 47:44.856
Time for you to do the same.

47:48.526 --> 47:50.320
I need to adjust our agreement.

47:51.904 --> 47:55.200
-Is that so?
-My daughter resides within these walls...

47:55.283 --> 47:57.202
in the palace of the Empress.

47:57.285 --> 48:01.331
Find her, spirit her away,
and I will deliver the monk.

48:07.837 --> 48:09.088
Give me the monk...

48:10.047 --> 48:11.424
or I kill you.

48:12.384 --> 48:14.136
I will find your daughter...

48:14.219 --> 48:15.970
and I will kill her too.

51:35.294 --> 51:36.421
Follow me.

52:14.208 --> 52:15.334
It was here.

52:19.046 --> 52:22.091
You shouldn't be here.
You must leave now.

52:22.174 --> 52:23.259
What was here?

52:23.342 --> 52:25.678
Why did you bring me here?

52:25.762 --> 52:27.722
What do I need to know?

52:27.805 --> 52:30.517
Only that you shouldn't be here.

52:54.123 --> 52:57.001
The bariyachi has declared
Kokachin safe for travel.

52:57.960 --> 53:00.547
We are all going to Xanadu... together.

53:02.590 --> 53:05.176
Oh! That's wonderful news.

53:10.389 --> 53:11.641
Never again.

53:23.778 --> 53:26.322
Long live the Khan!

53:28.074 --> 53:30.702
-Long live the Khan!
-Long live the Khan!

54:53.284 --> 54:55.662
Life harder on the road than you expected?

54:55.745 --> 54:57.163
On the contrary, Sire.

54:57.246 --> 55:00.583
It proved eye-opening
in ways I'd never dreamt.

55:04.170 --> 55:07.924
Does this mean we'll lose you forever
to the allure of my Silk Road?

55:09.383 --> 55:12.261
Actually, Sire,
if you would still consider it...

55:13.262 --> 55:15.264
I would like to accept the position
you offered previously

55:15.347 --> 55:16.766
in the Finance Ministry.

55:21.145 --> 55:22.188
Ah!

55:24.982 --> 55:27.902
Your nose has been opened, huh?

55:29.236 --> 55:32.198
I learned much about
the lives of your subjects.

55:32.281 --> 55:35.409
I realize just how much more
effective I can be...

55:38.621 --> 55:40.081
by your side.

55:45.211 --> 55:47.254
You know what this means, son?

55:49.799 --> 55:53.469
You finally feel worthy
of the power I offer you.

55:57.431 --> 55:58.766
I believe I do.
