He says that you can help us,
magnify the field.

37:41.389 --> 37:42.564
The field?

37:42.608 --> 37:44.914
What do you know
about time travel?

37:44.958 --> 37:47.656
I have a PhD
in quantum mechanics

37:47.700 --> 37:49.092

in nuclear physics.

The hall?

37:52.618 --> 37:55.534
Time is a hallway.

37:55.577 --> 37:58.754
It moves in two directions,
forwards and back.

37:58.798 --> 38:03.150

take him with me.

38:22.865 --> 38:25.433
I'll need tools, technology.

There's a, uh...

39:13.568 --> 39:17.616
The quantum field generated
by Subject A is too narrow

39:17.659 --> 39:20.445
to encompass also Subject B,
so I have to determine

39:20.488 --> 39:22.969
whether it's the intensity
of the field

39:23.012 --> 39:26.494
or its width-- breadth?--

39:26.538 --> 39:30.629
that's width-- that's the issueand then devise a solution.
