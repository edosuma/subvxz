WEBVTT

00:05.406 --> 00:08.809
What happens to a body that's
awake for 40 hours?

00:08.876 --> 00:11.045
Yellow zone!

00:11.112 --> 00:13.814
Four hours in one position,

00:13.881 --> 00:15.683
90 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.254
800 calories per hour...

00:20.321 --> 00:25.226
pain, pressure,

00:25.293 --> 00:28.996
forces, danger,

00:29.063 --> 00:30.598
heat...

00:30.664 --> 00:35.469
The only thing that exists
is the next corner.

00:41.842 --> 00:45.379
Le Mans is a car race
like no other,

00:45.446 --> 00:48.382
it's an endurance test
for drivers and cars

00:48.449 --> 00:52.120
that literally takes
24 hours to complete.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.522
55 cars will start,

00:54.588 --> 00:57.658
but many fewer will reach
the checkered flag.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.097
With unprecedented access
to six of the teams

01:03.164 --> 01:06.600
and the event itself,
this is the story of a race

01:06.667 --> 01:10.204
that pushes technology
to the limit

01:10.271 --> 01:12.473
but where the ghosts of the past

01:12.540 --> 01:14.542
are never far from the present.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.417
Well, good morning everybody.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.619
Le Mans is coming to life
down in the pits today

01:25.686 --> 01:28.789
as the teams prepare
for the first real test:

01:28.856 --> 01:30.558
qualifying.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.762
Just put it on the front.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.599
Push it down.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.410
This is a chance for
every garage to compete

01:40.434 --> 01:43.371
for pole position but
maybe more importantly

01:43.437 --> 01:45.038
to test and refine
different elements

01:45.105 --> 01:49.510
of their cars before they put
them out there for 24 hours.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.384
It's a technical racecar.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.018
You always have challenges,

01:58.085 --> 02:00.230
You have a long list with
items you would like to change.

02:00.254 --> 02:04.425
The closer it gets to the race
the priorities get tighter.

02:09.029 --> 02:12.300
In the top LMP1 class
we're expecting everyone

02:12.366 --> 02:14.034
to be pushed to the limit today.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.304
Nissan and Porsche
have joined Audi

02:16.370 --> 02:17.738
in bringing three cars today,

02:17.805 --> 02:20.274
a first for both of those teams.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.179
The main reason why
you do the third car

02:25.246 --> 02:28.616
is one more shot to go
for the for the top,

02:28.682 --> 02:31.752
top step on the on the podium.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.154
Because if you look in
the history of Le Mans race

02:34.222 --> 02:35.542
you lose one car
with an accident,

02:35.589 --> 02:37.458
you lose one car with
a technical failure

02:37.525 --> 02:39.793
and one gets through.

02:39.860 --> 02:43.231
The extra effort
with putting a third car

02:43.297 --> 02:45.566
on the grid, that is huge.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.338
Even in our brain somehow
we can handle two cars

02:50.404 --> 02:53.541
and coordinate but
the first time you go out

02:53.607 --> 02:56.644
with three cars,
you realize the third car

02:56.710 --> 02:57.711
is not just 50% more

02:57.778 --> 03:00.848
it feels like 100 or 200% more.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.621
Now, this is going to be
a heck of a race this year.

03:07.688 --> 03:11.058
So if you're not already
down at Le Mans, why not?

03:11.124 --> 03:13.227
- Ho!
- Ho.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.895
You know this, uh,

03:14.962 --> 03:17.231
here we are, we're
coming down to Dover.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.367
We're on the Le Mans trip.

03:21.235 --> 03:24.204
Pack the tent, hook
the caravan on the car.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.449
If you've got a bit
of money spare,

03:25.473 --> 03:27.341
book yourself into a chateaux.

03:29.810 --> 03:34.014
91.2 FM, this is mobile 1,
Radio Le Mans,

03:34.081 --> 03:37.217
live around the track
and around the world.

03:39.253 --> 03:43.190
Radio Le Mans all
started from enthusiasts.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.659
from just an FM service
at the track,

03:45.726 --> 03:47.127
from people who were already

03:47.194 --> 03:51.332
going to Le Mans as
fans back in the mid-1980s.

03:51.399 --> 03:55.503
And the three Mercedes
have lined themselves up.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.980
Over the years we've
grown and grown.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.205
Nowadays we broadcast,

03:58.272 --> 04:00.274
not just to the track
but around the world

04:00.341 --> 04:05.078
to something over
seven and a half million
fans during race week.

04:05.145 --> 04:08.549
My first year this year.
Fantastic!

04:11.251 --> 04:13.020
Le Mans, it's the Cathedral,

04:13.086 --> 04:15.756
it's the big Church,
it's where everybody comes to.

04:15.823 --> 04:18.559
It's like a pop festival,
except for cars.

04:20.227 --> 04:23.864
It's not one income group.
It's not one nationality.

04:25.666 --> 04:29.303
If you go around camp sites,
you're just as likely

04:29.370 --> 04:31.439
to see somebody in a
beaten up old van

04:31.505 --> 04:34.542
with half a dozen guys sitting,

04:34.608 --> 04:36.009
getting ready for the race

04:36.076 --> 04:39.747
and next door will be
a million pound super car.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.232
For you fans already down
here at

04:49.256 --> 04:50.558
the Circuit De La Sarthe

04:50.624 --> 04:52.225
plenty to see,
teams are out in front

04:52.292 --> 04:55.596
of the garages fine tuning
the art of their pit stops.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.337
Now, in Formula One,
you might see

05:05.373 --> 05:07.675
up to 20 mechanics on
a pit stop.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.143
Here at Le Mans,
only two mechanics

05:10.210 --> 05:11.612
working on the wheel change.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.486
Through the course of the race,

05:18.552 --> 05:23.056
each of the cars will take
over 400 gallons of fuel

05:23.123 --> 05:25.693
but only 40 tires.

05:27.294 --> 05:30.531
There'll be around 30 pit
stops through the 24 hours,

05:30.598 --> 05:33.467
and vital seconds can be
gained here and that's why

05:33.534 --> 05:36.537
teams practice repeatedly.

05:36.604 --> 05:39.740
To optimize the wheel
change time we have to try

05:39.807 --> 05:43.811
and make sure that
the car is perfect.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.647
If we can save 1 second
or half a second every time,

05:46.714 --> 05:50.518
you're looking at 15-plus
seconds which is critical.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.553
I've seen races come down
to much smaller gap

05:52.620 --> 05:54.855
than that after
24 hours of racing.

05:57.925 --> 06:02.896
Driver changes
requires perfect execution.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.843
It's not allowed for
one driver now to attempt

06:04.898 --> 06:07.768
the entire race,
so there's a team of three.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.404
They share the car,
they share the pain

06:10.471 --> 06:12.606
and hopefully they
share the glory.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.077
Chemistry between
three drivers on one car

06:17.144 --> 06:18.612
it... it is important

06:18.679 --> 06:20.524
because you're only as
good as the weakest link.

06:20.548 --> 06:24.552
With car number 17,
Timo Bernhard,

06:24.618 --> 06:26.420
Brendon Hartley

06:26.487 --> 06:29.222
and then last but not least,

06:29.289 --> 06:31.224
Mark Webber with all
the experience

06:31.291 --> 06:33.026
he had from Formula One.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.195
One of the best
sports car lineups

06:35.262 --> 06:37.097
we have seen in history.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.932
It's very, very important
that the guys,

06:38.999 --> 06:41.935
they put their ego a bit behind.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.371
I'm old, Brendon's young...

06:44.438 --> 06:46.574
- I'm in the middle somewhere.
- Yeah.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.942
Bit closer to him maybe.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.286
Unfortunately, I'm normally
the butt of the jokes,

06:50.310 --> 06:51.779
But that's, uh...

06:51.845 --> 06:53.289
But the young guy's gotta
earn his stripes, huh?

06:53.313 --> 06:55.193
We always take the Michael
out of the young guy.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.651
Actually I'm very lucky
to be an LMP1 driver

06:57.718 --> 07:01.354
and have two very, um,
experienced teammates...

07:01.421 --> 07:02.623
we genuinely work as a team,

07:02.690 --> 07:04.257
which, you know, technical side,

07:04.324 --> 07:05.893
on track, you know it's,

07:05.959 --> 07:07.495
it's a good little relationship.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.929
Communication is key.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.907
Obviously, sometimes we get
a bit more time to talk

07:10.931 --> 07:12.909
to each other, when the two
guys are out of the car

07:12.933 --> 07:15.669
we get about 5, 10 minutes
to talk to each other.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.205
but generally it's, uh,
through the radio or,

07:18.271 --> 07:20.216
you know, we're really
ships passing in the night.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.876
So sometimes you, sometimes
we don't see each other often,

07:22.943 --> 07:25.145
you know, if one's jumping in,
one's jumping out,

07:25.212 --> 07:27.581
Which is good, that means
the race is going smooth.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.788
We've reached that
moment when each team

07:34.855 --> 07:37.224
will really get to see
their rivals in action

07:37.290 --> 07:39.092
for the first time.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.128
The roads have been
closed to public traffic

07:41.194 --> 07:44.264
through four hours today
and two tomorrow.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.501
Each car has the chance to
test themselves on the track,

07:47.568 --> 07:49.112
and whoever puts in
the fastest single lap

07:49.136 --> 07:51.639
will be in pole position
on the starting grid.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.978
Now, if you're you new to
Le Mans, you might be asking,

07:58.045 --> 08:00.981
"Why are the cars
all different shapes?"

08:04.017 --> 08:07.254
Well, that's because Le Mans
is not actually just one race,

08:07.320 --> 08:11.124
but four different races
going on at the same time.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.563
First of all you've got the GTs,

08:15.629 --> 08:17.164
or Grand Touring Cars.

08:18.932 --> 08:23.203
That's your Aston Martins,
Ferraris, Corvettes

08:23.270 --> 08:28.141
The GTs look like road cars
but are highly developed.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.778
And there are two main
prizes on offer here:

08:30.844 --> 08:32.379
one for the
professional drivers,

08:32.445 --> 08:34.514
and one for the amateurs.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.652
Then the faster cars:

08:38.719 --> 08:42.890
the LMPs or Le Mans Prototypes.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.324
These cars are
built specifically

08:44.391 --> 08:47.661
to regulations written
by the race organizers.

08:52.399 --> 08:56.169
Again, they are divided
into two classes:

08:56.236 --> 08:58.105
LMP2...

09:02.976 --> 09:06.146
And then the real
space rockets of LMP1.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.150
This is where you'll find
the fastest cars

09:10.217 --> 09:14.087
and the ones battling it out
for overall victory.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.924
It's only professional
drivers in these LMP1s,

09:16.990 --> 09:18.792
and this is the
category the likes of

09:18.859 --> 09:21.729
Nissan, Porsche and Audi
have entered.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.134
Well, as we move on
through qualifying,

09:27.200 --> 09:28.769
we'll see just what
the impact of

09:28.836 --> 09:30.403
the winter's development has had

09:30.470 --> 09:34.241
on the speed of these cars.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.010
I've heard people saying
that the Audis and the Porsches

09:37.077 --> 09:40.213
are going to do
3 minute 13 laps.

09:42.482 --> 09:45.919
There is no way on this earth
that Audi have found

09:45.986 --> 09:48.455
10 seconds over the winter,
it's impossible.

09:48.521 --> 09:51.558
3:19.866 for
the number 8 car.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.995
That's the fastest Audi so far.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.731
3:17.767
for Timo Bernhard

09:57.798 --> 10:00.167
in the car he shares
with Mark Webber...

10:00.233 --> 10:03.070
3:16.887 for Neel Jani

10:03.136 --> 10:05.138
and Porsche have blown
the old record

10:05.205 --> 10:08.275
out of the water,
they have destroyed it!

10:10.610 --> 10:12.713
We knew we would
have a quick car.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.785
With our hybrid system,
we had some advantages

10:17.851 --> 10:19.386
definitely on one lap.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.825
But at the same time we know
it's a 24 hour race.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.129
We know about the great
experience Audi's having

10:29.196 --> 10:31.699
and that's something
you always have in mind.

11:04.597 --> 11:08.235
Rain just makes its appearance
when you least expect it.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.871
For some of these drivers
this qualifying session,

11:10.938 --> 11:13.406
rain will be most unwelcomed.

11:17.745 --> 11:18.922
You have different
weather conditions

11:18.946 --> 11:20.189
in different parts of the track.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.183
Here it's been
quite wet all day.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.318
There's dry corners at
the back end of the circuit,

11:25.385 --> 11:26.286
it's quite dry.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.155
So for us to deal
with that, you know,

11:28.221 --> 11:29.699
how heavy is it
raining on the screen?

11:29.723 --> 11:31.163
Is it quite heavy?
Is it quite light?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.927
Trying to deal with those
different conditions.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.867
This race is not
always about pace,

11:39.933 --> 11:42.169
you must, must, must
be there at the end.

11:44.004 --> 11:47.140
Porsche have Audi rattled
here, all of the Audis

11:47.207 --> 11:49.276
are at least a second slower

11:49.342 --> 11:51.211
than the third-best
Porsche.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.850
Starting in the first place
is not a very important thing.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.152
The job is to get
a good racecar.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.821
Also the three of us
have to get through

12:00.888 --> 12:03.423
a certain amount of driving
to get your rhythm.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.393
Le Mans, so many
things can happen,

12:06.459 --> 12:09.062
you can be as well
prepared and as you want.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.731
Have the fastest car but
human error,

12:11.799 --> 12:15.668
technical issue, something
can always happen.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.505
Coming into the last hour
there's trouble for Nissan,

12:18.571 --> 12:20.451
the rules of Le Mans state
that before the end

12:20.507 --> 12:23.143
of qualifying, every car
must record a lap time

12:23.210 --> 12:27.180
of no more than 110%
of the class leader.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.549
Well, at the moment
none of the Nissans

12:29.616 --> 12:31.885
are anywhere near and
that's got to be a

12:31.952 --> 12:33.429
disappointment for
PlayStation gamer

12:33.453 --> 12:37.090
Jann Mardenborough in
his first year in LMP1.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.195
As the checkered flag is out,

12:42.262 --> 12:46.399
it's Porsche who have
locked out the front row...

12:46.466 --> 12:48.501
a record busting run.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.771
Porsche, they've got the
bragging rights, John.

13:02.515 --> 13:05.152
Day before the race
and it's absolutely

13:05.218 --> 13:07.220
tipping down here
in the paddock.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.122
Qualifying wrapped
up last night.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.324
Porsche firmly up
front on pole position.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.993
At the other end,

13:13.060 --> 13:16.463
well, I'm afraid it didn't
go too well for Nissan.

13:16.529 --> 13:17.965
Pretty bleak I'm afraid.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.791
They didn't set a fast
enough time to be up

13:19.833 --> 13:23.070
at the front with the other
LMP1 hybrid manufacturers

13:23.136 --> 13:25.272
and they'll start
the race tomorrow

13:25.338 --> 13:27.240
at the very back of the grid.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.943
That is a bitter pill
to swallow for Darren Cox

13:30.010 --> 13:31.544
and the rest of the team.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.516
I keep using war
analogies and, uh,

13:36.583 --> 13:38.383
one of the best, uh,
war quotes I've heard is,

13:38.418 --> 13:41.221
"The plan changes as soon
as you engage the enemy."

13:43.223 --> 13:45.893
The team are a bunch of racers,
the drivers, the engineers,

13:45.959 --> 13:47.560
the mechanics, the guys in here,

13:47.627 --> 13:50.830
we're all racers and
it's difficult for us

13:50.898 --> 13:52.065
not to be at the front.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.037
Some of the other competitors
have literally

13:57.104 --> 14:00.173
laughed behind their hands
at what we're doing.

14:02.075 --> 14:05.178
Well, that really is,
I think, a terrible slight

14:05.245 --> 14:07.156
on these guys that have
been working 18 hours a day

14:07.180 --> 14:10.050
to try and get this sporting
program out the door,

14:10.117 --> 14:12.485
on track, and try and compete.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.762
We're faster than
we were last year,

14:22.829 --> 14:25.198
because we weren't here,
and that's what motor sport

14:25.265 --> 14:28.801
and technology and innovation
is all about, is progress.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.403
And we're making
progress every time.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.780
- Okay.
- How thick it that piece?

14:31.804 --> 14:33.240
Like a centimeter?
Or not that much?

14:33.306 --> 14:35.875
Yeah, it's probably
one a half Centimeters.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.644
- Yeah.
- I can probably...

14:37.710 --> 14:39.947
David and Goliath story
is quite short, isn't it?

14:40.013 --> 14:41.414
He basically gets his stones out

14:41.481 --> 14:43.392
and whacks Goliath and
that's the end of the story.

14:43.416 --> 14:47.187
Well, in reality, you know,
he's probably honed his,

14:47.254 --> 14:49.356
uh, catapult and stones
over many, many years

14:49.422 --> 14:51.158
and you just don't see
that in the story.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.859
And we're honing our catapult,

14:52.926 --> 14:54.827
and we're honing our
stones right now

14:54.894 --> 14:56.329
but we're doing it in public.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.933
We've got a plan,
we need to stick to it,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.969
we need to let those
German guys go out

15:02.035 --> 15:03.212
and beat the crap
out of each other

15:03.236 --> 15:05.305
and we'll see what happens.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.676
The most optimistic thing,
it rains non-stop

15:09.742 --> 15:11.487
from 3 o'clock Saturday
until 3 o'clock Sunday

15:11.511 --> 15:14.714
and then anything could happen.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.683
Worst case scenario,

15:16.749 --> 15:20.487
no, you don't even
want to think about it.

15:22.555 --> 15:25.258
A unique feature of Le Mans
and the 24 hour race

15:25.325 --> 15:28.061
is that on Friday there's
something very, very special.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.897
The streets of the city of
Le Mans are taken over

15:30.964 --> 15:32.499
by hundreds of
thousands of fans,

15:32.565 --> 15:36.369
and the drivers are
paraded in front of them.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.641
And it's gone back all the way

15:41.708 --> 15:43.710
through to 1923
when the race started.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.212
That epic event:

15:45.278 --> 15:47.147
Les vingt quatre heure du mans.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.450
It's an outpouring of
respect for the,

15:50.517 --> 15:54.887
the challenge that the
drivers are going to take.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.158
For small boys, it's
all a delightful dream.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.107
The driver's parade is a
bit overwhelming sometimes.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.544
I'm still the same person in
the car park playing football

16:51.611 --> 16:53.280
with my mates and then here

16:53.346 --> 16:55.048
where everybody wants
to sign stuff.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.050
It's just really weird.

17:01.621 --> 17:05.558
I think it was the age of two
he discovered matchbox cars.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.662
He used to go off to sleep
with them and wake up

17:09.729 --> 17:13.066
in the morning and be
imprinted in his face.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.944
You've got to pinch
yourself to a degree,

17:15.968 --> 17:17.246
for him to be doing
what he's doing,

17:17.270 --> 17:19.106
after three and a half,
four years racing

17:19.172 --> 17:21.441
is just mind-boggling.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.413
In the early days when he
first won the competition

17:26.479 --> 17:29.582
it was very difficult trying
to explain to grandparents,

17:29.649 --> 17:32.018
for instance, that he's
been playing this game

17:32.085 --> 17:33.453
in his bedroom on his computer,

17:33.520 --> 17:35.355
and now he's in a really live...

17:35.422 --> 17:37.357
- Racing car!
- Racing car.

17:37.424 --> 17:40.427
Kind of, uh, took
took some explanation.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.167
We do understand that
there is a danger element

17:47.234 --> 17:48.954
with anything which has
got an engine in it.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.048
If you're gonna crash
in a real racing car,

17:53.072 --> 17:54.507
you're going into the wall.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.211
In a game you can just
press restart and start again.

18:04.016 --> 18:08.621
We couldn't get a
live stream of the race.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.458
To read on twitter that
your son was involved

18:11.524 --> 18:15.528
in an accident
was quite alarming.

18:18.998 --> 18:22.502
He had a big accident,
not his fault,

18:22.569 --> 18:24.837
his car left the track,
got airborne.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.277
For a young guy, any young guy

18:30.343 --> 18:32.845
that is a horrendous experience.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.249
It doesn't matter
that he's a gamer,

18:36.316 --> 18:37.660
it just matters he's a
young man that's been

18:37.684 --> 18:40.587
in a horrible accident
that needs to be supported.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.524
I think his character's
very strong

18:44.591 --> 18:45.834
and at the moment he seems okay.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.227
But you just never know.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.630
You never know what
impact it's had.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.111
It's kind of changed him
a little bit I think.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.247
He said, every time
we leave the house,

18:58.271 --> 19:02.309
we've got to say I love you

19:02.375 --> 19:05.011
On a phone call,
on a, on a message.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.346
No matter where we are.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.224
No matter where we are
in the world, I love you.

19:08.248 --> 19:12.719
Because he knew that he
could've, could've gone.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.921
I'm not talking
about the Nürburgring.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.623
Nah, don't want to do that.

19:30.770 --> 19:34.607
When it's the day of the
world's greatest motor race,

19:34.674 --> 19:37.076
there's something
more than a little frisson

19:37.143 --> 19:39.312
of excitement in the air.

19:40.913 --> 19:44.116
There's something very
special about getting up

19:44.183 --> 19:47.186
knowing that you're
not going to bed

19:47.254 --> 19:49.422
for somewhere in
the region of 40 hours.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.628
This place brings,
it brings people back,

19:55.695 --> 19:57.573
no matter what they're
doing they keep coming back,

19:57.597 --> 19:59.098
and they wanna watch the race,

19:59.165 --> 20:01.734
they want to be involved,
they want to be part of it.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.883
Of course the Marshalls
have been out since dawn

20:07.907 --> 20:09.742
closing off the roads
to the public

20:09.809 --> 20:12.712
that these supercars will
be racing down shortly.

20:17.917 --> 20:21.788
There's 24 hours to go before
the checkered flag is out.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.656
Just how many of these cars

20:23.723 --> 20:26.859
will actually make
it to the finish?

20:30.797 --> 20:32.074
Every morning
I wake up and think,

20:32.098 --> 20:33.333
"What the hell are we doing?"

20:33.400 --> 20:35.702
No doubt about that.

20:35.768 --> 20:39.739
But if you thought about
the big picture, you'd stop.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.043
You have to be a bit
of an adrenaline junky

20:44.110 --> 20:45.645
to do this kind of thing.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.881
It's been 20 hours a day
for nearly a year so it's,

20:48.948 --> 20:51.818
it's, it's completely
ridiculous and, you know,

20:51.884 --> 20:54.654
every night we go "Do we try
to give the guys enough sleep

20:54.721 --> 20:57.690
that they are not
falling apart?"

20:57.757 --> 20:59.826
I feel pretty anxious.

20:59.892 --> 21:04.564
There's a lot of
expectation from Nissan

21:04.631 --> 21:07.400
so I'm just eager
to get on the track.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.806
One thing we're
almost guaranteed is

21:13.873 --> 21:15.908
some sort of history
to be made this year.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.911
Porsche are in search of
a record breaking 17th win

21:18.978 --> 21:21.080
in the great race, of course
and Audi have won it

21:21.147 --> 21:25.017
an incredible 13 times
in the last 15 years.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.955
Timo will start the race.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.122
We have the guns we have.

21:30.189 --> 21:31.558
If the guns are not big enough

21:31.624 --> 21:33.424
then we just have to
keep on hanging in there.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.405
We want to get to the
morning obviously,

21:36.429 --> 21:37.564
see what's left and then

21:37.630 --> 21:40.266
we'll push on,
push on from there.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.936
Once I'm actually in the car,
I know it's just like minutes

21:44.003 --> 21:46.339
away from starting the
biggest race of the year.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.040
We always say
the bullshit stops and

21:48.107 --> 21:50.042
then we can finally go racing.

21:57.049 --> 22:00.052
Also, if we get a win
from the much touted

22:00.119 --> 22:02.522
number 7 car, the Audi,

22:02.589 --> 22:04.090
then Lotterer, Treluyer
and Fassler

22:04.156 --> 22:07.760
will become the most
successful team ever.

22:09.261 --> 22:13.466
To win is one thing but to
keep winning is another one,

22:13.533 --> 22:15.334
so the pressure's
more on Porsche.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.537
They're so eager to win again

22:17.604 --> 22:21.574
but doesn't mean that
we don't want it either.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.925
We're about to get underway,
with impeccable timing

22:38.991 --> 22:43.229
from the race organizers and
their seven minute warm up lap.

22:43.295 --> 22:47.567
It'll be the 83rd running
of the Le Mans 24 hours.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.523
Massive news from the pit lane.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.949
Jann Mardenborough is
stuck in the garage.

23:03.015 --> 23:06.419
Nismo mechanics are trying
to fix something on the car,

23:06.486 --> 23:08.096
but at this rate,
I don't think he's going

23:08.120 --> 23:09.422
to make it to the start.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.773
Cars going left and right,
zig zagging trying

23:26.839 --> 23:29.141
to keep the tires clean
and perhaps a little warmth

23:29.208 --> 23:31.343
in the rubber as well.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.581
Really important if you want
to get off to a fast start.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.633
Stand by for action as
the LMP1s, the P2s

23:53.700 --> 23:56.869
and the GT cars come to
the end of the warm up lap.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.224
In a moment we're gonna unleash

24:18.290 --> 24:21.193
over 30,000 horsepower.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.877
The black and
the red Porsches,

24:32.939 --> 24:35.608
18 and 17 doing a decent job

24:35.675 --> 24:38.077
at just getting a
bit of a breakaway.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.012
The two Audi's matching
them at the moment,

24:40.079 --> 24:43.516
there are the Toyotas
in the background as well.

24:51.624 --> 24:55.762
Huge move by Timo Bernhard
in the Porsche number 17!

24:55.828 --> 24:57.597
That's Mark Webber's
car leading.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.333
It was my plan to take the
lead quite early.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.202
The Audi's...

25:03.269 --> 25:05.605
I mean they were fighting,
the three Audi's are all over.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.840
Once I took the lead
I said "Okay that's...

25:07.907 --> 25:10.076
I don't want to
give it back!"

25:13.012 --> 25:15.081
Timo Bernhard is
the race leader.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.684
on his way to
the Mulsanne corner.

25:21.788 --> 25:24.023
Boost one, boost one.

25:24.090 --> 25:27.627
Copy boost one, copy boost one.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.768
So unusual to see them
this close in the modern era.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.870
Porsche still one, two, three
as they come

25:37.937 --> 25:39.806
down towards the Porsche curves.

25:39.872 --> 25:43.175
Now, this is where
the Audi's are actually
a little bit quicker.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.112
They might pick up
some paces but can
they get by?

25:49.882 --> 25:52.952
Just to make the point,
everyone else has completed

25:53.019 --> 25:55.287
the first lap successfully,
so the only

25:55.354 --> 25:56.954
car not to have
completed the first lap

25:56.989 --> 25:59.592
is that number 23 Nissan.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.463
I couldn't stay on the grid.

26:04.530 --> 26:07.099
To be that far back is
just painful for me.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.577
Oh, big trouble, big trouble

26:08.601 --> 26:10.336
for one of the factory GT
Porsches

26:10.402 --> 26:12.639
at the 1st chicane.

26:12.705 --> 26:13.973
Fire!
You are on fire.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.350
Get out of the car,
get out of the car,

26:15.374 --> 26:18.344
get out of the car,
get out of the car.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.680
And now Andre Lotterer
goes up the inside

26:20.747 --> 26:24.751
up into second position.
He's right there.
