WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.015
Hey, birthday girl. You ready?

00:03.040 --> 00:06.210
Remember de-escalation training
tomorrow, mandatory.

00:06.281 --> 00:08.176
Oh, it's my dream Saturday. Thank you.

00:08.210 --> 00:10.381
Not all about you, Burgess.
We all gotta be there.

00:10.406 --> 00:12.407
Let's jump this joint.

00:12.444 --> 00:14.411
Ladies, it's Friday night.

00:14.446 --> 00:16.046
Let's get to Molly's
and make some bad decisions.

00:16.081 --> 00:19.149
Um, I think we're right behind you.

00:19.174 --> 00:20.751
Speaking of bad decisions,
birthday girl,

00:20.785 --> 00:22.720
are you ready for these
annual Malort shots?

00:22.754 --> 00:25.313
That's a negative.
It's a low-key event this year.

00:25.338 --> 00:28.392
Besides, Randall has the flu,
gonna make it an early night.

00:28.426 --> 00:30.769
No problem with that. I gotta
make a quick run to Bucktown.

00:30.816 --> 00:32.396
Yeah? You want me to come with?

00:32.430 --> 00:33.980
Uh-uh. Uh, meet you at Molly's.

00:34.027 --> 00:35.566
- Okay.
- Okay, so I heard

00:35.600 --> 00:37.167
that Otis convinced Herrmann to put

00:37.202 --> 00:38.969
a karaoke machine in at Molly's.

00:39.004 --> 00:40.571
Bad idea.

00:40.605 --> 00:42.239
Attracts the wrong kind of crowd.

00:42.273 --> 00:44.108
I don't know, could be really fun.

00:44.142 --> 00:45.743
When pigs fly, Burgess.

00:47.445 --> 00:49.413
♪ Let me tell you it's always cool ♪

00:50.949 --> 00:52.650

00:52.684 --> 00:54.368

00:57.064 --> 00:59.099
You're next, Antonio.
How about a little Sinatra?

00:59.133 --> 01:00.834
That's grandpa music.
I'll find something.

01:00.868 --> 01:02.202
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.748
You understand the majesty
of the Chairman of the Board, right?

01:04.781 --> 01:05.781
Jay, come back.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.883
I wouldn't mind hearing
a little "Summer Wind."

01:07.918 --> 01:08.985
Oh.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.725
Kev! Hey, man, where you at?
Get down here.

01:15.759 --> 01:17.425
- Come down here!
- We're all here.

01:17.450 --> 01:19.261
Get down here.

01:19.296 --> 01:20.724
It keeps going to voicemail.

01:20.755 --> 01:22.465
He'll be here, don't worry.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.305
Yo.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.617 --> 01:43.119
Let me see your hands.

01:46.223 --> 01:47.590
Don't move.

01:47.624 --> 01:49.424
Just take it easy, a'ight?

01:49.449 --> 01:50.760
Don't move.

01:50.794 --> 01:53.562
Listen, man.

02:03.140 --> 02:05.474
Time to pay for your sins.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.556
- Sorry.
- You're late.

02:20.590 --> 02:22.191
I know. I'll do the make-up test.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.793
I... I was looking for Kev.

02:23.827 --> 02:26.295
- Any luck at his house?
- No.

02:26.329 --> 02:28.030
Mail's untouched, his bed's still made.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.533
But he's car's not there so it
looks like he never came home.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.201
And he's a no-show for this.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.903
Let's track him down. Trudy.

02:33.937 --> 02:35.805
Ping his direct connect phone.
Start there.

02:35.839 --> 02:37.239
Hey, so listen,
last night he said he had

02:37.274 --> 02:38.541
to take care of something in Bucktown.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.242
He ever mention anything
like that to you?

02:40.277 --> 02:41.351
No.

02:41.376 --> 02:42.898
Anything about Jordan and Vinessa?

02:42.923 --> 02:43.991
- No.
- No.

02:43.992 --> 02:47.183
Right? I mean last time I
heard, they were doing great.

02:47.217 --> 02:49.051
Hey, I think I got him.

02:51.722 --> 02:53.656
Phone's pinging from Rosewood.

02:53.690 --> 02:56.692
4458 North 14th Street.

02:56.727 --> 02:58.561
That's a long way from Bucktown.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.007
It's cold.

03:12.042 --> 03:14.410
- Doesn't look damaged.
- Small miracle in this hood.

03:14.444 --> 03:18.581
Hellcat wheels go for 400
a pop on the street.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.917
What was he doing here?

03:21.952 --> 03:24.186
Got his phones.

03:24.221 --> 03:26.722
His personal's dead.

03:29.226 --> 03:32.194
Got an address.

03:32.229 --> 03:35.197
4458.

03:35.232 --> 03:37.399
That's right here.

03:39.736 --> 03:42.037
5021 George. Squad,
I need a name associated

03:42.072 --> 03:45.207
with an address: 4458 North 14th Street.

03:45.242 --> 03:46.876
<i>Standby.</i>

03:46.910 --> 03:48.878
- You find anything?
<i>- Got a Joe Baker.</i>

03:48.912 --> 03:50.813
<i>Two priors for delivery, one assault.</i>

03:50.847 --> 03:53.115
Atwater ever mention a Joe
Baker, felon that lives here?

03:53.150 --> 03:55.384
- I got the back.
- No, why? What's going on?

03:55.418 --> 03:59.088
Found his address in the car.
Let's see if he's home.

04:04.361 --> 04:06.128
What the hell?

04:12.035 --> 04:13.536
Hailey.

04:15.605 --> 04:17.572
- Clear.
- Clear.

04:18.308 --> 04:19.642
Clear.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.778
- Kim, I'm opening the door.
- Okay!

04:24.147 --> 04:26.482
Anything?

04:31.454 --> 04:33.122
I got blood here.

04:46.336 --> 04:47.937
What?

04:47.971 --> 04:50.072
It's Atwater's badge and ID.

04:54.644 --> 04:56.879
First thing they tell you
in the Academy.

04:56.913 --> 04:59.348
Offender gets a gun on you,
you dump your ID.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.683
You never tell 'em you're a cop.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.785
All right, so...

05:02.819 --> 05:05.955
Offender attacks Atwater in here.

05:05.989 --> 05:08.390
He dumps his star.

05:08.425 --> 05:10.826
Then he walks him outside.

05:15.866 --> 05:17.533
Last thing Kevin got was a few messages

05:17.567 --> 05:18.834
from a woman named Michelle.

05:18.869 --> 05:20.302
She was waiting to hear from him.

05:20.337 --> 05:21.704
Have Platt track her down.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.472
Garage was padlocked. Found this inside.

05:23.506 --> 05:25.241
- Half a brick of coke.
- So Joe Baker's

05:25.275 --> 05:27.877
back dealing again.
Someone tries to rip him off?

05:27.911 --> 05:29.345
And Atwater got caught
in the middle of it.

05:29.379 --> 05:30.980
Yeah, but what the hell
was Atwater doing here

05:31.014 --> 05:32.915
- in the first place?
- Maybe he got a lead

05:32.949 --> 05:34.483
- and was trying to make a bust.
- But he wouldn't go in alone.

05:34.517 --> 05:36.151
- We all know that.
- All right.

05:36.186 --> 05:37.887
Let's keep digging into Joe Baker.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.322
Find the connect
between him and Atwater.

05:40.357 --> 05:41.757
Hailey, come over here.

05:41.791 --> 05:43.592
Everybody come over here. Listen up.

05:43.627 --> 05:45.494
I want to keep this in-house for now.

05:45.528 --> 05:49.198
Look, this leaks? They find out
Kevin's a cop, he's a dead man.

05:49.232 --> 05:51.400
- All right, what else we got?
- All right, so we found out

05:51.434 --> 05:53.669
that Joe Baker, he didn't show
up to work yesterday.

05:53.703 --> 05:55.237
Any connections between him and Kevin?

05:55.272 --> 05:58.240
No, Atwater didn't make
any of Baker's pinches.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.675
He's not on any CI rolls.

05:59.709 --> 06:01.610
All right, any calls or texts to Kevin?

06:01.645 --> 06:03.412
No, no. Baker's last communication was

06:03.446 --> 06:06.015
a series of texts between him
and a guy named Calvin Hill.

06:06.049 --> 06:08.017
- Hill have a sheet?
- No, he's clean.

06:08.051 --> 06:10.920
Okay, so we find Hill. Fast.

06:13.156 --> 06:15.024
- Calvin Hill.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:15.058 --> 06:16.859
- Whoa.
- I'm Detective Dawson.

06:16.893 --> 06:19.194
This is my partner Burgess.
You know a guy named Joe Baker?

06:19.229 --> 06:21.030
Sure do. Why? What's going on?

06:21.064 --> 06:22.464
We're looking for him.
Have you seen him?

06:22.499 --> 06:23.699
Have you spoken to him?

06:23.733 --> 06:25.301
Thursday we had drinks together.

06:25.335 --> 06:27.569
- How you know him?
- We coach at the Y together.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.605
You ever seen him with this guy?

06:29.639 --> 06:31.640
No, don't know that guy.

06:31.675 --> 06:34.143
Wait, are you telling me
that Joe's missing?

06:34.177 --> 06:36.145
- Yes, since Thursday.
- Last time you saw Joe,

06:36.179 --> 06:38.047
was he acting nervous?
Scared of anybody?

06:38.081 --> 06:40.382
No, we were just catching up
at the Slide Bar.

06:40.417 --> 06:43.052
Okay, so it was just you two
at the bar all night?

06:43.086 --> 06:44.219
For the most part.

06:44.254 --> 06:46.155
Then he met this little honey
and they left together.

06:46.189 --> 06:48.991
- You catch her name?
- Sonya something.

06:49.025 --> 06:50.993
Look, are we done? I gotta get to work.

06:51.027 --> 06:52.895
Yeah, just stay in town, Calvin.

06:52.929 --> 06:55.130
I'm not going anywhere.

06:56.633 --> 06:59.068
I just talked to Mattison at the lab.

06:59.102 --> 07:02.604
The blood in Baker's living
room is a match to Atwater.

07:06.943 --> 07:08.911
Sarge, we got something.

07:08.945 --> 07:10.846
I've been monitoring
Joe Baker's social media.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.415
This just got posted.

07:13.450 --> 07:14.950
<i>Listen. Listen to me.</i>

07:14.985 --> 07:16.352
<i>I ain't got it, man.</i>

07:16.386 --> 07:18.087
<i>All right, come on.</i>

07:18.121 --> 07:20.934
- There he is.
<i>- This is payback.</i>

07:20.959 --> 07:23.200
It was posted anonymously.
Screen name "Venganza."

07:23.225 --> 07:24.456
Means revenge.

07:24.481 --> 07:26.261
This profile's fake.
It was created just to post this.

07:26.296 --> 07:27.997
All right, we know we got
at least two offenders.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.698
There's one guy filming,
and one guy doing the beating.

07:29.733 --> 07:32.211
All right, let's get some
OCD techs on this right away.

07:32.236 --> 07:33.802
- I want someone we can trust.
- I got a guy.

07:33.837 --> 07:36.505
Good, use him. Al, Antonio.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.422
You shake down every Latino gang,

07:38.447 --> 07:40.476
drug crew associated with Joe Baker.

07:40.510 --> 07:41.777
All right, run it again.

07:41.811 --> 07:43.679
- Freeze on that fist.
- Okay.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.280
It's a Mexican flag, gangster style.

07:45.315 --> 07:47.683
All right, see if it pops
with any of our knowns.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.885
Look at the windows. Stained glass.

07:49.919 --> 07:51.553
- Yeah. Church?
- Could be.

07:51.588 --> 07:52.788
Well, it's better than nothing.

07:52.822 --> 07:55.057
- Good news, he's alive.
- Yeah.

07:55.091 --> 07:57.459
And he's gonna stay that way.

08:07.203 --> 08:09.805
Hey, yo. Keep it down, man.

08:09.839 --> 08:11.006
They'll come back.

08:11.041 --> 08:13.175
What the hell did you do to them?

08:13.209 --> 08:15.677
I ain't do nothin' to them. All right?

08:15.712 --> 08:17.179
I never seen them before in my life.

08:17.213 --> 08:19.348
Man, you think now is
a good time to play me, fam?

08:19.382 --> 08:20.749
Huh? If you got their dope,

08:20.784 --> 08:22.418
just give it back.
Man, this ain't worth it.

08:22.452 --> 08:24.386
The hell's wrong with you?
You deaf or something, man?

08:24.421 --> 08:25.692
What'd I just say?

08:25.717 --> 08:27.323
I don't know them,

08:27.348 --> 08:29.491
and I ain't got their dope, a'ight?

08:29.526 --> 08:30.893
I'm out of the game.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.594
I've been clean ever
since I made parole.

08:32.629 --> 08:34.163
Come on, man. Only chance we got is

08:34.197 --> 08:35.664
if you own up to the truth,
Joe, that's it.

08:35.698 --> 08:36.932
Don't you talk to me

08:36.966 --> 08:39.068
about owning up to no truth, a'ight?

08:39.102 --> 08:41.904
- You need to do that.
- Not now, not now.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.173
Come on, Joe. Not now, man.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.742
I feel like I'm in hell being
chained up with the bastard

08:46.930 --> 08:48.744
who murdered my son.

08:56.951 --> 08:58.357
- Sergeant.
- Yeah?

08:58.382 --> 09:00.834
A couple of things.
According to Halstead's guy at OCD,

09:00.842 --> 09:02.376
the Facebook post is a dead end.

09:02.410 --> 09:03.777
- The IP address is encrypted.
- All right.

09:03.812 --> 09:05.646
I had more luck digging into Joe Baker.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.215
Found a connection
between him and Atwater.

09:08.249 --> 09:10.170
- That is Ronnie Cartwright.
- Mm-hmm.

09:10.195 --> 09:12.886
Five years ago Ronnie robs
a 7-Eleven in West Lawn.

09:12.921 --> 09:15.236
He kills the clerk, the whole
thing is caught on video,

09:15.261 --> 09:17.730
- and Ronnie's on the lam.
- Atwater made the arrest.

09:17.755 --> 09:19.653
Yeah, Atwater was conducting a canvas,

09:19.678 --> 09:21.812
sees Ronnie coming out
of the housing projects.

09:21.837 --> 09:23.593
Ronnie runs. Atwater corners him.

09:23.627 --> 09:26.427
Ronnie pulls a gun. Good-bye Ronnie.

09:27.431 --> 09:28.755
Were you there?

09:28.951 --> 09:30.667
I was close, but I didn't see it.

09:30.701 --> 09:32.135
But there were a lot of witnesses.

09:32.169 --> 09:34.971
And Atwater went through
the Round Table, IPRA, IAD,

09:35.006 --> 09:37.629
you name it. It was ruled a good shoot.

09:37.839 --> 09:40.175
Okay, I'll bite.

09:40.945 --> 09:42.912
What's this got to do with Joe Baker?

09:42.947 --> 09:44.581
- Everything.
- Hey.

09:44.615 --> 09:45.877
- What's up?
- We found Michelle,

09:45.918 --> 09:47.517
the girl that messaged
Atwater last night.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.910
- Yeah.
- She's Joe Baker's sister.

09:51.601 --> 09:54.169
Bring her in now.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.362
How is that possible?

09:56.396 --> 09:58.347
You have no idea what's going on?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.065
Like I just told you,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.902
I called Kevin 'cause I was
worried about my brother.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.537
- He's been missing...
- Yes, we know.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.971
His parole officer called you yesterday.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.473
Joe missed a meeting.
You went by his house.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.275
He wasn't there. You called him.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.043
- He's not answering. We know.
- Okay, I get it.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.445
You're scared.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.273
- Why not call the police?
- I did.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.750
The car never showed.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.385
They get here fast to arrest us,

10:19.419 --> 10:20.986
not so much when we need help.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.455
Why would you call the guy
who killed your nephew?

10:23.490 --> 10:26.826
I don't blame Kevin for what went down.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.327
I loved Ronnie.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.296
But I knew what kind of kid he was.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.131
Always trying to be a gangster.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.732
Wouldn't listen to nobody.

10:33.767 --> 10:37.636
And Kevin always said
if I needed something to call.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.471
- So I did.
- Because you were worried

10:39.506 --> 10:41.607
about Joe being in trouble
with gangbangers?

10:41.641 --> 10:42.708
No.

10:42.742 --> 10:45.244
- He's out of the game.
- He ain't out of the game.

10:45.278 --> 10:48.781
We found a half a kilo
of cocaine in Joe's garage.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.916
What?

10:50.951 --> 10:54.753
- No. That can't be ri...
- Michelle.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.856
Do you know who Joe was running with?

10:56.890 --> 10:59.291
No. No. He's not dealing anymore.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.993
I know my brother.

11:01.027 --> 11:04.396
This isn't... this isn't
making any sense.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.366
You know anyone with that tattoo?

11:07.400 --> 11:10.469
- No.
- You sure?

11:10.503 --> 11:13.472
Look, I'm telling you I don't know.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.482
You packing quite a cohete.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.184
You ain't a cop, are you?

11:25.218 --> 11:27.386
Cop? I'm a security guard.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.022
Glock 17 CPD's bread and butter.

11:30.056 --> 11:31.824
I don't know about that, man.
My boss gave me a gun.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.692
I said thank you. I kept on moving.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.494
Hmm.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.865
- What's your name?
- Anthony?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.500
Anthony.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.203
I just want my product
returned, Anthony.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.504
This is how I feed my family.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.672
I told you. I don't have it.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.140
I'm sorry to hear about that.

11:48.174 --> 11:50.476
Come on, man. I'm not the guy, okay?

11:50.510 --> 11:51.877
What were you doing
over at his house then?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.145
I was going over there to just meet up

11:53.179 --> 11:54.480
with him on a Friday night.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.648
- To do what?
- To hang out. We homeys.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.216
- Homeys?
- Yeah.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.684
You the same homey that was
with him the other night

11:58.718 --> 12:00.719
I got jacked at his house?

12:00.754 --> 12:02.154
I already told you, I
don't know nothing about that.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.492
Yo, got the cash.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.993
Wore a mask.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.261
How much you pull?

12:09.296 --> 12:11.230
300. Maxed out Joe's card.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.032
But check out the receipt.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.234
You richer than you look.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.003
Damn. 19 G's in the savings?

12:18.038 --> 12:20.339
Yeah, and you ain't getting
none of that.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.674
No?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.042
The city gave me that money

12:23.076 --> 12:24.610
for what they did to my son.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.279
It's a settlement. And
it's all that I have left.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.082
So you're gonna have to bury me
before I give it up.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.518
- Yeah, you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm damn sure...

12:36.756 --> 12:38.357
You don't tell me how it's gonna be.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.759
Monday morning, you and me,
we going to the bank.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.028
And you're gonna take out all 19,000.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.898
We'll bring a shovel just in
case you're feeling stupid.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.210
Okay, got it. Thanks.

12:58.244 --> 12:59.311
All right, listen up.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.713
Asset Forfeiture got a hit

13:00.747 --> 13:03.048
on Joe Baker's debit card.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.985
These surveillance stills
are from a walk-up ATM

13:06.019 --> 13:06.885
in West Lawn.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.488
This guy with a max took out 300 bucks.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.923
Maxed out Joe's daily limit,

13:10.957 --> 13:12.725
but he still got over
19 grand in the account.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.493
- When was this?
- Three hours ago.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.128
So, if they're after money,
there's a good chance

13:16.162 --> 13:18.464
they're gonna wait until Monday
and wipe out the account.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.798
Well, that leaves us 36 hours.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.266
All right, Jay, Upton, head over

13:21.301 --> 13:22.901
to West Lawn to this ATM.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.671
Check PODS, surveillance
of nearby businesses.

13:25.705 --> 13:29.108
Maybe we catch Skeletor
parked somewhere close.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.528
Hey, you sure you okay?

13:50.997 --> 13:54.433
It ain't the first time I've been shot.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.769
And you...

13:56.803 --> 13:59.104
I bet you see this
all the time, being police.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.640
Shooting brothers for no reason.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.645
You know, I know two people

14:06.679 --> 14:09.515
that were out there that night.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.683
Both of them say...

14:11.718 --> 14:14.119
Ronnie never tried to grab a gun.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.488
- He never even reached for it.
- No. No.

14:16.523 --> 14:20.626
You shot Ronnie like he was a damn dog.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.127
You put his ass in the ground.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.829
You don't know what
the hell happened, man.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.499
Yes, I do. I damn sure do.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.868
The city paid me 20 G's.

14:29.903 --> 14:33.572
That shows and proves
you a damn murderer.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.542
I bet you don't even think
about it again.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.484
I killed a young black male, Joe.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.087
Yeah, you did.

14:48.121 --> 14:52.858
You have no idea
how much that affects me.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.893
Think I became a cop so that
I could kill people, man?

14:54.928 --> 14:57.062
Especially not my own people.
We talking about Ronnie.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.397
Yeah, right.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.834
Ronnie's from the same place I'm from.

15:01.868 --> 15:05.003
Come on, man. I think about
that boy damn near every day.

15:05.038 --> 15:09.141
He one of the last faces I see
when I shut my eyes at night.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.878
And you know who else I think about?

15:12.912 --> 15:15.080
Huh?

15:15.115 --> 15:18.083
That clerk he murdered.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.286
You even know his name?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.122
Do you even care?

15:23.156 --> 15:26.058
Mikal Shamardi.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.862
He was also in dental school.
He also had a wife.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.530
Her name was Kimberly,
and they had a bright future

15:31.564 --> 15:33.265
ahead of 'em before your son

15:33.299 --> 15:34.900
came and took it for $312.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.436
That clerk owed my son money.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.606
- He was just there to collect.
- It was a robbery, Joe.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.207
Says you.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.876
Says you.

15:43.910 --> 15:48.981
And what? So... so you a cop,
so you just get to win?

15:49.015 --> 15:50.616
Nah.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.552
Let me tell you something. Right here.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.454
Right now.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.589
I got the power.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.392
Because if I tell those cats
you a damn cop

16:00.426 --> 16:01.793
they gonna light your ass up.

16:01.828 --> 16:03.629
Man, they're gonna light
your ass up too.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.564
Yeah, well.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.399
Since I'm gonna die anyway,

16:07.433 --> 16:10.569
I may as well get some
satisfaction before I go.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.079
Take a seat.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.414
Look, I still don't understand what I...

16:22.448 --> 16:23.916
Shut up.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.984
Is it Sonya or Elisa?

16:26.019 --> 16:27.753
Sonya? My name is Elisa.
What... what is this?

16:27.787 --> 16:29.922
Elisa, you ever been to Slide Bar?

16:29.956 --> 16:31.256
No, that doesn't ring any bells.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.125
- It doesn't?
- Anything ringing now?

16:33.159 --> 16:35.027
That's your car. We ran the plates, see?

16:35.061 --> 16:36.695
You need to tell us what happened.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.389
Nothing, that's just a drunk guy

16:38.414 --> 16:40.199
- that I gave a ride home to.
- Elisa!

16:40.233 --> 16:42.434
You need to stop lying because this

16:42.468 --> 16:44.937
this right here,
that's kidnapping and assault.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.271
And a couple of Class A felonies.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.839
The other guy they kidnapped is a cop.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.808
- And my friend.
- So we're done playing.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.977
Where are they? Where are they?!

16:52.011 --> 16:53.612
I don't know, I don't know.
He didn't tell me.

16:53.646 --> 16:54.980
Who didn't tell you?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.391
Reimundo. Reimundo Morales.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.218
He's this guy that I know.
He paid me to do it.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.520
I... I swear I don't know
anything about a cop.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.788
Why'd Reimundo grab Joe Baker?

17:02.822 --> 17:04.723
Reimundo said Joe jumped him

17:04.757 --> 17:06.525
a few weeks ago and stole his drugs,

17:06.559 --> 17:08.026
and so he started following him.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.895
And then he saw Joe pull
into the Slide Bar.

17:09.929 --> 17:12.631
And so he called me, and he...
he told me to play him.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.566
Play him how?

17:14.601 --> 17:16.835
- Play him how!?
- I told him...

17:16.868 --> 17:19.137
I told him I wanted
to have sex with him.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.872
So I put... I put a pill in his drink

17:20.906 --> 17:22.507
and we met up with Reimundo
at some parking lot.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.875
Okay, where did they take him?

17:23.910 --> 17:25.844
I don't know. I don't know, I swear.

17:25.877 --> 17:29.815
I don't know, I swear.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.316
Elisa Rodriguez, you're being charged

17:31.351 --> 17:33.578
with kidnapping and assault.
Stop crying.

17:33.603 --> 17:35.571
No.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.993
You guys have been down here
for a long time.

17:41.027 --> 17:45.097
It's been cold. No food, no water.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.899
I mean, you got to be thirsty.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.837
Come on.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.705
Here you go.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.248
That's the best you can do? Hm?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.229
Tell me something to make me stop.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.698
Like where my coke is.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.467
All right, I can't tell you

18:22.502 --> 18:25.137
where your coke is because I don't know.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.606
All right? Now, look.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.042
Whether you believe me or not,
I'm telling you it's the truth.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.076
It's the truth.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.477
Wait, wait, wait a minute!

18:32.512 --> 18:34.079
But there's something I could tell you.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.115
There's something that you need to know.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.718
That man right there.
He ain't who he says he is.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.153
What the hell you mean?

18:41.187 --> 18:42.754
- It means...
- It means I was lying, man.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.589
I ain't no damn security guard, a'ight?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.625
I deal dope, too.

18:46.659 --> 18:47.893
Okay, I'm the one who took your coke.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.261
It was me and one of my partners.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.595
Joe ain't had nothing to do with it,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.130
but we did use his house.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.566
Okay? A'ight? Now, there it is.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.068
I did it.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.003
- And I know you want payback.
- You damn right.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.072
Right. Which is understandable.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.574
- But that's also not smart.
- Why?

19:02.608 --> 19:03.742
Because everyone knows that money

19:03.776 --> 19:05.410
spends better than revenge.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.845
Come on, man.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.647
Right? Let me get you
some real money, man.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.981
Right?

19:10.016 --> 19:11.616
I'm talking about serious paper, dog.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.118
Just get us up out of here.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.288
Forget this whole
misunderstanding, man, forgive.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.090
- I don't do forgiveness.
- What?

19:18.124 --> 19:19.624
- That ain't in my nature.
- Ah, man.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.093
Come on, man, huh. Nah.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.795
Come on, man. Nah, man.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.151
Here.

19:56.860 --> 20:01.094
This little game. It ain't gonna work.

20:01.688 --> 20:03.925
They're gonna kill us.

20:04.685 --> 20:06.386
It's just a matter of time.

20:06.423 --> 20:08.724
Oh, no, we're not dying. Not today.

20:08.758 --> 20:11.445
Okay? Just keep your damn
mouth shut and let me do this.

20:15.035 --> 20:17.949
Hey. Hey, yo, man, let me holler at you.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.003
Can I ask you a question, man?
You stupid or what?

20:21.037 --> 20:23.241
- Huh?
- What the hell you say to me?

20:23.266 --> 20:24.757
I'm just saying, man,
I just told your boy

20:24.782 --> 20:26.883
that I can get you a lot of money.

20:26.918 --> 20:28.852
And instead of asking me
where it is or how much

20:28.886 --> 20:30.456
this man drilled a damn hole in my leg.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.023
Okay.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.424
How much?

20:34.459 --> 20:36.269
100K.

20:36.427 --> 20:37.928
Hm.

20:37.962 --> 20:39.896
When can you get it by?

20:39.931 --> 20:42.072
As soon as you get me a damn phone.

20:44.775 --> 20:46.536
Yo.

20:46.571 --> 20:48.405
Don't play me, homey.

20:48.439 --> 20:49.535
It's insulting.

20:52.353 --> 20:55.488
I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that, not to you.

20:55.523 --> 20:57.324
100K.

20:57.358 --> 21:00.660
A'ight? That's a lot of money, bro.

21:04.198 --> 21:05.699
Hey, Sarge, we got something.

21:05.733 --> 21:07.000
That brick of coke in Joe's garage.

21:07.034 --> 21:08.668
Techs lifted some prints.

21:08.703 --> 21:11.004
They match Calvin Hill.

21:11.038 --> 21:14.140
Calvin Hill? His friend from the Y?

21:14.175 --> 21:17.444
Grab him. Put him in the cage.

21:20.047 --> 21:22.515
You got a problem with that?

21:22.550 --> 21:24.451
No.

21:27.321 --> 21:30.190
You don't know how many times
I thought about killing you.

21:32.093 --> 21:33.526
I'm guessing a lot.

21:35.563 --> 21:39.132
I used to think of all kind
of ways of how to do it.

21:39.166 --> 21:42.869
Smashing you in the head with a bat.

21:42.903 --> 21:46.206
Shooting you in the back of the head.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.375
Or the face.

21:48.409 --> 21:52.045
Guess it wouldn't make much difference.

21:52.079 --> 21:54.381
But you know what I would...

21:54.415 --> 21:57.584
I would usually come back to this.

21:57.618 --> 21:59.819
Me...

21:59.854 --> 22:02.021
Grabbing you by the neck.

22:04.191 --> 22:07.861
Squeezing as hard as I could.

22:07.895 --> 22:11.030
Then watching your eyes go blank.

22:13.434 --> 22:16.903
I used to think about that
at night in the joint.

22:19.240 --> 22:23.143
It's my own little special way
of counting sheep.

22:32.119 --> 22:35.455
Ronnie would be 20 next week.

22:35.489 --> 22:38.057
If it wasn't for you.

22:40.161 --> 22:42.228
I know.

22:43.831 --> 22:46.266
But none of this is on you, huh?

22:46.300 --> 22:48.268
Me?

22:48.302 --> 22:50.136
I remember Ronnie. He wasn't a bad kid.

22:50.171 --> 22:52.605
Till he started imitating
his gangbanger daddy.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.207
I was teaching him how to be a man.

22:54.241 --> 22:56.843
You were teaching him how to die.

23:14.595 --> 23:16.362
What's this?

23:19.467 --> 23:23.837
This is where we talk
to people when there's...

23:23.871 --> 23:26.406
Special circumstances.

23:26.440 --> 23:29.142
- Okay, I don't follow.
- Hm.

23:29.176 --> 23:31.010
Well, we dumped your phone.

23:31.045 --> 23:33.413
Found a lot of calls
to Reimundo Morales.

23:33.447 --> 23:36.516
Mm-hmm. The drug dealer you ripped off.

23:36.550 --> 23:39.819
Holding your friend Joe
and my friend Kevin,

23:39.854 --> 23:42.956
a cop, hostage.

23:43.624 --> 23:46.159
See Joe...

23:46.193 --> 23:48.995
He wasn't even in town
the night of the robbery.

23:49.029 --> 23:50.997
Mm-hmm.

23:51.031 --> 23:52.632
Yeah, we talked to his parole officer.

23:52.666 --> 23:55.802
You know what he said?

23:55.836 --> 23:58.471
He said Joe was in Wisconsin.

24:00.875 --> 24:03.009
But I guess you already knew that.

24:03.043 --> 24:06.012
- I want a lawyer.
- Oh, it's too late for that.

24:10.017 --> 24:13.386
Calvin.

24:13.420 --> 24:15.989
- Where's Reimundo live?
- I don't know.

24:16.023 --> 24:18.833
You don't know? Don't know.

24:19.059 --> 24:21.628
- Here, catch.
- Man.

24:21.662 --> 24:25.131
What the hell are you doing?

24:25.165 --> 24:27.433
Yeah, what am I doing?

24:29.737 --> 24:31.371
Two years ago,

24:31.405 --> 24:35.041
put some punk in here,
held him for a few hours.

24:35.075 --> 24:38.044
Turns out he snuck a gun in here.

24:38.078 --> 24:39.812
Put it under his chin.

24:43.884 --> 24:45.885
Blew the top of his head off.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.154
His finger prints were all over the gun.

24:51.091 --> 24:55.028
- Where's Reimundo live?
- I don't know.

24:55.062 --> 24:58.765
Okay! Me and one of my boys
ripped off Reimundo.

24:58.799 --> 25:02.468
We wore mask so he wouldn't
know it was us.

25:03.804 --> 25:05.872
Was Reimundo with anybody else?

25:05.906 --> 25:07.840
Yeah.

25:07.875 --> 25:10.043
I think it was his cousin.

25:10.077 --> 25:12.412
A guy named Vasquez.

25:12.446 --> 25:16.583
We took a half a brick,
and I hid it in Joe's garage.

25:16.617 --> 25:19.052
That's all I got.

25:19.086 --> 25:20.753
I swear, man.

25:22.823 --> 25:24.991
Please.

25:26.827 --> 25:28.962
Arrest this punk.

25:28.996 --> 25:31.698
Come on. Come on.

25:40.641 --> 25:42.909
I hear you been putting ideas
in my cousin's head.

25:42.943 --> 25:44.377
Yeah. They real good ideas though.

25:44.411 --> 25:46.713
You expect me to believe 100 grand?

25:46.747 --> 25:48.314
If I'm lying, you'll kill me, right?

25:48.349 --> 25:50.283
- Think about it.
- Okay, where's the money?

25:50.317 --> 25:52.118
With my homey, A.D.

25:52.152 --> 25:54.220
I gave him three bricks last week.

25:54.254 --> 25:56.122
At 35 a piece so, I mean,
you do the math.

25:56.156 --> 25:57.824
- And your boy's got the money?
- Come on, man.

25:57.858 --> 25:59.258
Of course he's got the money.

25:59.293 --> 26:00.960
A'ight. It's my money.

26:00.995 --> 26:03.162
You hear me? So just let me
get on the phone with him.

26:03.197 --> 26:04.897
Come on, bro. You can listen
to the whole conversation

26:04.932 --> 26:07.900
if you want to, just at least
let me make the phone call.

26:10.504 --> 26:12.639
Put in the number.

26:24.018 --> 26:26.914
If someone doesn't answer, you die.

26:33.731 --> 26:35.052
Hey.

26:35.090 --> 26:37.567
Atwater has been missing for 32 hours.

26:37.615 --> 26:39.215
Adam, 32 hours.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.817
Isn't it time for all hands on deck?

26:40.851 --> 26:42.585
It might be worth the risk.
It's Atwater.

26:42.620 --> 26:43.877
It's not our call.

26:43.902 --> 26:45.455
Somebody in Narcos could know something.

26:45.489 --> 26:46.890
You got to let it go.

26:46.924 --> 26:48.526
- I don't want to let it go.
- All right, hey.

26:48.551 --> 26:50.852
We got to stay cool.

26:50.995 --> 26:54.483
- All right? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure, whatever you say.

26:56.767 --> 26:58.920
That's my UC phone. Maybe it's a tip.

26:59.003 --> 27:00.194
You know?

27:04.608 --> 27:07.443
- Yeah.
<i>- Hey. A.D.</i>

27:07.478 --> 27:09.312
<i>A.D. What's up, man?</i>

27:09.346 --> 27:11.147
<i>Uh, I need to renegotiate</i>

27:11.172 --> 27:12.842
<i>that deal from last week, man.</i>

27:12.867 --> 27:14.108
<i>You can do me that solid, right?</i>

27:14.151 --> 27:16.319
Hey, you cool, man?
I haven't heard from you.

27:16.353 --> 27:18.254
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm good, okay?</i>

27:18.289 --> 27:19.622
<i>Just listen to what I'm saying.</i>

27:19.657 --> 27:21.563
Last week, right?

27:21.617 --> 27:23.118
I fronted you 3 bricks at about 35.

27:23.181 --> 27:25.216
<i>So you should be at
about 105 large, right?</i>

27:25.250 --> 27:26.283
You want the money now?

27:26.318 --> 27:28.953
- Yeah, man, things change.
<i>- We had a deal.</i>

27:28.987 --> 27:30.454
I'm not saying we don't.

27:30.488 --> 27:32.623
I'm not saying we don't have
a deal, I'm just saying

27:32.657 --> 27:34.625
I need my money now so

27:34.659 --> 27:37.294
<i>how about next time I get you
in about 30 a piece, huh?</i>

27:37.329 --> 27:39.663
<i>- How that sound?
- I hear that.</i>

27:39.698 --> 27:41.966
<i>Okay, so we good?</i>

27:42.000 --> 27:44.835
I can get you 90, only cause it's you.

27:44.869 --> 27:46.203
When and where, bro?

27:46.238 --> 27:47.471
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

27:47.505 --> 27:48.872
Let's meet me at that

27:48.907 --> 27:50.908
Old factory on 95th and Bishop,

27:50.942 --> 27:52.309
and I'll send one of my guys

27:52.344 --> 27:54.712
<i>- to come grab that.
- No, no, no, man.</i>

27:54.746 --> 27:56.247
It's gotta be you.

27:56.281 --> 27:58.582
I'm not giving that kind
of cash to a stranger.

27:58.617 --> 28:00.751
A.D. This the only way it's gonna work,

28:00.785 --> 28:02.319
you understand me?

28:02.354 --> 28:03.654
So, 95th and Bishop.

28:03.688 --> 28:05.756
<i>Bring the money, okay?</i>

28:08.093 --> 28:09.326
<i>A.D.</i>

28:09.361 --> 28:11.262
All right, man, if that's how it is.

28:11.296 --> 28:13.697
It's your money. Give me two hours.

28:13.732 --> 28:16.700
My man. Sounds good to me.

28:17.936 --> 28:19.270
How are we gonna get the money?

28:19.304 --> 28:21.171
We can't go to Woods for the 1505 funds.

28:21.206 --> 28:23.374
Just let me worry about that.

28:24.909 --> 28:26.543
Get the money from my basement.

28:26.578 --> 28:29.513
Put it in a bag, stitch in a
listening device and a tracker.

28:29.547 --> 28:30.848
You got it.

28:32.317 --> 28:34.518
Check, check. Bag mic work?

28:34.552 --> 28:36.120
You hear me all right?

28:36.154 --> 28:38.589
Copy. We got you over here, man.

28:38.623 --> 28:40.891
Hey. We got him.

28:45.063 --> 28:46.897
All right, Firebird's coming.

28:46.931 --> 28:49.033
<i>Remember, let the exchange happen.</i>

28:49.067 --> 28:51.168
<i>This guy's gonna lead us to Atwater.</i>

29:19.331 --> 29:21.265
You A.D.?

29:21.299 --> 29:23.500
Who's asking?

29:23.535 --> 29:25.069
Friend of Anthony's.

29:25.103 --> 29:27.304
You got a package for me?

29:43.888 --> 29:45.756
It's all there.

29:45.790 --> 29:48.058
I ain't taken your word.

29:58.470 --> 30:00.270
It's been real, yo.

30:00.305 --> 30:01.939
Hey.

30:03.208 --> 30:06.276
Tell Anthony I'll see him soon.

30:20.158 --> 30:23.227
Come on, man. What's the point, huh?

30:23.261 --> 30:26.530
Even if you got out,
you're still zip tied.

30:26.564 --> 30:30.234
I can cut the zip-tie with
that broken pipe right there.

30:32.570 --> 30:35.205
- You don't give up, do you?
- No, I don't.

30:40.111 --> 30:42.980
Ronnie say anything before you shot him?

30:43.014 --> 30:45.482
Huh? For real, all right?

30:45.517 --> 30:49.353
I've been thinking
about this for too long.

30:49.387 --> 30:52.156
Come on, man.

30:52.190 --> 30:55.025
That's not gonna bring Ronnie back.

30:55.059 --> 30:58.562
Okay? And that's not gonna
get us out of here.

30:58.596 --> 31:01.198
So, let's focus on the now.

31:04.369 --> 31:06.703
<i>Hey, I got the cash. I'm coming at you.</i>

31:06.738 --> 31:09.673
No, no, change of plans.
Take it over to Exley's.

31:09.707 --> 31:10.874
Stay there, stay hidden.

31:10.909 --> 31:12.176
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

31:12.210 --> 31:14.378
- I'm gonna clean up here.
- You got it.

31:15.780 --> 31:17.414
I'm headed that way right now.

31:17.449 --> 31:20.250
<i>Man, who'd have known
it'd been so easy, right?</i>

31:20.285 --> 31:22.019
He's going to a friend's place?

31:22.053 --> 31:23.854
He's not going back to the location.

31:23.888 --> 31:25.389
So these guys got what they wanted.

31:25.423 --> 31:27.691
- They're gonna kill Kevin.
- All right, let's move in.

31:27.725 --> 31:30.027
Do not shoot unless necessary.

31:30.061 --> 31:31.962
This guy is our only link to Atwater.

31:31.996 --> 31:34.731
<i>Repeat, do not shoot.</i>

31:36.334 --> 31:38.535
Yo, I've been made. It's a setup.

31:45.443 --> 31:47.544
Get out the way!

31:47.579 --> 31:48.946
Come on!

31:56.154 --> 31:58.121
Chicago PD! Let's see those hands!

31:58.156 --> 32:00.357
- Do it!
- Damn it!

32:01.092 --> 32:03.727
Let's see your hands.

32:03.761 --> 32:06.263
Billy!

32:06.297 --> 32:08.232
Billy.

32:08.266 --> 32:09.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:09.934 --> 32:12.236
Hey, hey, drop the weapon.

32:12.270 --> 32:14.638
- Drop it.
- Put the gun down.

32:14.672 --> 32:18.275
- Drop it or we will shoot you.
- No, no, no, hey, hey.

32:18.309 --> 32:20.744
No one's gonna shoot you, man.

32:21.279 --> 32:24.081
All right? There you go.

32:24.115 --> 32:25.916
No one's gonna shoot you
if you put that gun down.

32:25.950 --> 32:27.317
We just want to talk to you.

32:27.352 --> 32:29.753
- You talk to us, we can help.
- Go to hell!

32:29.787 --> 32:32.356
Billy, hey.

32:32.390 --> 32:34.458
You talk to us.
We can make this go away.

32:34.492 --> 32:36.760
Billy.

32:36.794 --> 32:38.495
Billy!

32:42.534 --> 32:45.602
No!

32:45.637 --> 32:47.971
5021 emergency, shots fired at police.

32:48.006 --> 32:50.040
- Offender down.
- Where are they?

32:50.074 --> 32:52.876
- Where's my partner?
- 3944 South Hoover.

32:52.911 --> 32:54.444
You're not dying.

32:54.479 --> 32:56.413
Come on, man.

33:01.019 --> 33:02.619
I got it.

33:02.654 --> 33:04.321
- He's gone.
- I got this, I got this.

33:04.355 --> 33:06.657
- He's gone.
- I got this.

33:11.829 --> 33:14.097
Adam, he's gone.

33:16.701 --> 33:19.136
Why'd you do that?
You just killed Kevin, man.

33:19.170 --> 33:20.370
What'd you say?

33:20.405 --> 33:21.838
- You just killed Kevin!
- Adam.

33:21.873 --> 33:23.473
Why couldn't you have
shot him in the leg?

33:23.508 --> 33:25.208
- Adam! No!
- He was our only lead!

33:25.243 --> 33:26.476
- Adam!
- What if I miss

33:26.511 --> 33:28.011
and he shoots Burgess? Then what?

33:28.046 --> 33:30.147
It was the right call, Adam. Stop!

33:30.181 --> 33:31.815
It was the right call.

33:37.121 --> 33:40.190
- What do we do now?
- Hey.

33:40.224 --> 33:43.160
I tell you what we do now.

33:43.194 --> 33:45.696
We all get back on the same page.

33:47.765 --> 33:50.867
And we double down on what we got. Al.

33:50.902 --> 33:53.604
Grab Billy's phone,
ping Reimundo's burner.

33:53.638 --> 33:56.340
Okay, we all saw that Kevin was
near a stained glass window.

33:56.374 --> 33:58.675
That means he's probably in a church.

33:58.710 --> 34:00.577
So we're gonna search every damn church

34:00.612 --> 34:02.879
within a mile radius of that cell tower.

34:02.914 --> 34:04.226
- Yeah.
- Come on.

34:04.315 --> 34:06.550
We're running out of time. Let's go.

34:27.101 --> 34:29.369
There.

34:29.478 --> 34:31.237
Here.

34:33.580 --> 34:35.275
Hey, come on. That way.

36:29.609 --> 36:32.211
We all good, Joe.

36:32.270 --> 36:34.316
We good.

36:34.653 --> 36:36.874
- Wait.
- I'll tell the cops he shot you.

36:36.927 --> 36:38.761
Wh... what are you doing?

36:38.804 --> 36:41.560
Is this the gun you used

36:41.740 --> 36:43.669
to kill my son?

36:43.842 --> 36:45.427
Huh?

36:45.644 --> 36:48.692
Well, how does it feel now, huh?

36:49.181 --> 36:51.716
How does it feel?

36:53.752 --> 36:55.737
Joe.

36:56.121 --> 36:58.299
What did my son say?

36:58.423 --> 37:01.058
- Right before you killed him dead.
- Come on, Joe.

37:03.319 --> 37:05.695
Tell me how it went down!

37:06.865 --> 37:08.799
Tell me.

37:10.468 --> 37:12.169
I was yelling at him.
I told him to stop.

37:12.204 --> 37:13.470
I told him to get down.

37:13.505 --> 37:15.339
I said, "Get down on your knees!"

37:15.373 --> 37:17.274
But Ronnie wouldn't do it.

37:17.309 --> 37:19.109
He wouldn't do it, Joe.
He just kept on running.

37:19.144 --> 37:20.277
And then I just kept on screaming.

37:20.312 --> 37:21.512
And then he pulled out his gun.

37:21.546 --> 37:22.813
Last thing that came out
of his mouth was

37:22.847 --> 37:26.784
"I don't get down
on my knees for no man."

37:26.818 --> 37:28.118
He pulled out his gun, Joe.

37:28.153 --> 37:29.453
- And it was either...
- Are you sure?

37:29.487 --> 37:30.788
- Come on, man.
- That's what he said?

37:30.822 --> 37:32.289
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- Are you sure

37:32.324 --> 37:34.124
that's what he said?

37:34.159 --> 37:36.961
I wouldn't lie to you, brother.

37:36.995 --> 37:38.829
I wouldn't.

37:40.332 --> 37:43.000
Are you...

37:43.034 --> 37:45.402
Come on, Joe.

37:45.437 --> 37:49.039
On everything I love, bro.

37:49.074 --> 37:50.975
Adam.

37:51.009 --> 37:52.409
Stand down.

37:52.444 --> 37:55.813
Stand down. Joe, put the gun down.

37:55.847 --> 37:57.581
We good, right?

37:57.616 --> 37:59.183
We good.

37:59.217 --> 38:02.486
Just drop it. We all good, bro.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.755
Stand down. We all good, right, Joe?

38:04.789 --> 38:06.890
Just put the gun down.

38:06.925 --> 38:08.892
Just put the gun down, man.

38:12.397 --> 38:14.331
We're all right.

38:19.971 --> 38:22.106
Ooh, how is that leg?

38:22.140 --> 38:25.509
It's not that bad. It'll be okay.

38:25.543 --> 38:27.344
So, Sarge, how about we give Joe a break

38:27.379 --> 38:30.948
on those drugs he stole?
He did come through in the end.

38:30.982 --> 38:35.119
Joe didn't steal the drugs.
Some punk named Calvin Hill.

38:35.153 --> 38:36.420
What?

38:36.454 --> 38:38.589
Yeah, whole thing was a mistake.

38:45.297 --> 38:46.964
Wow.

38:46.998 --> 38:48.432
Hey.

38:48.466 --> 38:50.534
- I know exactly who that is.
- It's me.

38:50.568 --> 38:53.203
Yeah, what's up, girl?

38:53.238 --> 38:55.039
- Glad you're okay.
- Me too.

38:55.073 --> 38:57.541
Thank you. Thank you.

38:58.576 --> 39:00.944
I'll be right back. Give me two seconds.

39:00.979 --> 39:03.547
Trudy, I'm sorry I missed your birthday.

39:03.581 --> 39:05.949
I was kind of in the middle...

39:05.984 --> 39:09.253
Mm.

39:16.127 --> 39:18.462
Antonio.

39:19.764 --> 39:22.566
I am sorry about before, man.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.735
I was really out of line.

39:24.769 --> 39:28.906
I was just...
I was so worried about Kev.

39:28.940 --> 39:30.741
We all were.

39:32.711 --> 39:35.112
That was a hell of a shot though.

39:35.146 --> 39:37.414
Thanks.

39:51.896 --> 39:54.098
What's up?

39:54.132 --> 39:56.400
Yeah, what's happening?

39:59.804 --> 40:02.773
How you holding up? You all right?

40:02.807 --> 40:05.275
Yeah, I'm cool, you know.

40:05.310 --> 40:07.811
Doc says I'm gonna be all right so.

40:10.715 --> 40:13.951
I'm not gonna lie,
I thought you stole the dope.

40:18.223 --> 40:21.325
And I ain't proud of that.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.762
I shouldn't assume that.

40:27.599 --> 40:30.667
But it does feel good to be wrong.

40:34.739 --> 40:36.807
So yeah.

40:37.609 --> 40:41.111
You got no idea how close
I came to shooting you.

40:44.182 --> 40:45.949
Yeah.

40:50.422 --> 40:52.523
Why didn't you?

40:56.428 --> 40:59.696
Because of what you said before.

41:01.099 --> 41:04.401
Ronnie's last words.

41:04.436 --> 41:08.739
"I don't get on my knees for no man."

41:12.377 --> 41:14.678
I taught him that.

41:18.149 --> 41:21.185
I used to drill those damn words

41:21.219 --> 41:25.022
in his head every day
since he was a little boy.

41:27.592 --> 41:31.028
So what he did...

41:31.062 --> 41:34.097
What happened...

41:35.300 --> 41:37.668
That's on me.

41:45.276 --> 41:47.611
It's on me.
