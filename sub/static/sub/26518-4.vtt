to solve that is in my kitchen?

01:28.262 --> 01:29.567
Well, it's not
the only way,

01:29.611 --> 01:31.395
but it's definitely
the most delightful way.

And, okay, I'm also
a little bit worried about

01:33.005 --> 01:35.356
my favorite FBI power couple.
Is that a crime?

01:35.399 --> 01:37.314
Yeah. It's called
breaking and entering.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.533
Not when you have a key.

01:38.576 --> 01:39.795
How do you have

How are you doing,
by the way?

01:44.408 --> 01:45.496
'Cause people
think about the afflicted,

01:45.540 --> 01:46.454
they don't think about
the caregiver,

01:46.497 --> 01:47.585

01:47.629 --> 01:48.934
I mean, you know,

01:53.374 --> 01:54.418
What are you making?

01:54.462 --> 01:55.680
Uh, let's see.
The recipe calls for

01:55.724 --> 01:58.944
ten cups of cream,
a cup of lemon juice,

01:58.988 --> 02:00.772
a hint of rosemary,

02:00.816 --> 02:03.166
sliced okra-- I'm not
crazy about that part...

02:03.210 --> 02:04.689
Uh, yeah, I'm not
crazy about that.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.952
You shouldn't be mixing
the lemon juice in the cream.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.258
What do you mean?
I just did.

02:08.302 --> 02:10.956
Abbondanza. I wouldn't do that.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.915
Yeah.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.396
So the lemon juice,
that curdles the cream.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.789
Mm-hm, it really does.
Right in your mouth.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.226
Now, what is this?

02:19.269 --> 02:21.837
It's a recipe for
Brunswick stew.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.839
Cream shouldn't be there.

02:23.882 --> 02:26.798
Oh, Roman, you minx.

02:26.842 --> 02:27.886
It's a Caesar shift,

02:27.930 --> 02:29.105
and cream
is the key

02:29.149 --> 02:30.367
to unlocking it.

how in action movies,

27:56.413 --> 27:59.416
cops are always saying like,
"This time it's personal"?

27:59.460 --> 28:01.244
It's because it's the ones
that are in too deep,

28:01.288 --> 28:02.942
those are the ones
that do the job.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.944
You know what I mean?
They don't just sit around

28:04.987 --> 28:06.206
waiting to read reports.

28:06.249 --> 28:07.337
You've been eavesdropping

28:07.381 --> 28:09.078
on Patterson and I's
conversations.

28:09.122 --> 28:10.340
I keep my ears open, okay?

28:10.384 --> 28:11.820
Sometimes stuff
falls into them.

28:11.864 --> 28:14.344
Okay, look, if you quarantine
your feelings on this,

28:14.388 --> 28:16.956
that's not only gonna be
unhealthy for you as a person,

28:16.999 --> 28:18.392
it's bad for you
as a cop.

28:18.435 --> 28:20.873
You might as well turn off
one of your senses.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.789
Wait, this can't be.

28:23.832 --> 28:24.790
What can't be?

28:24.833 --> 28:27.053
Uh...

28:27.096 --> 28:29.533
Laurel was infected
by bacterial spores,

28:29.577 --> 28:30.839
but according to her blood,

28:30.883 --> 28:33.450
she was killed
by a viral infection.

28:33.494 --> 28:35.104
Could it be a mutation?

28:35.148 --> 28:36.671
An impossible mutation.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.979
Bacterias and viruses
are like apples and...

28:40.022 --> 28:42.372
Cheeseburgers, hot dogs.Dolphins.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.592
It's as if Laurel
was exposed

28:44.635 --> 28:46.202
to an entirely
different pathogen

28:46.246 --> 28:47.856
after she was in quarantine.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.118
How is that possible?

28:50.816 --> 28:52.121
It's Weller.

28:53.253 --> 28:54.733
What's up, Kurt?

28:54.776 --> 28:55.603
You guys seeing this?

28:55.646 --> 28:56.778
Seeing what?

28:56.822 --> 28:58.911
Someone just hacked open
the SIOC door.

28:58.954 --> 29:02.349
Who would be stupid enough
to do something like that?

29:02.392 --> 29:03.698
A bunch
of very scared people

29:03.742 --> 29:05.004
that are about to get
themselves killed,

29:05.047 --> 29:06.701
that's who.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.572
We have to stop them from
getting out of that hallway.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.531
Good work.

29:18.931 --> 29:19.975
Problem?

29:20.019 --> 29:21.803
One of these doors
is usually unlocked.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.022
To think,
in a few minutes,

29:23.065 --> 29:24.414
we'll know
Shepherd's location.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.416
And if we're lucky,
a bunch of FBI employees

29:26.460 --> 29:28.592
are about to catch
a very bad cold.

29:28.636 --> 29:30.420
Too bad Weller's
not one of them.

29:30.464 --> 29:32.292
Nice, but you
and I both know

29:32.335 --> 29:33.815
that he should already
be dead.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.425
What are you hiding
behind your back?

29:36.905 --> 29:38.820
Why are you hesitating?

29:38.864 --> 29:41.954
It was too soon.For who

29:41.997 --> 29:43.999
You really wanna talk
about this right now?

29:44.043 --> 29:45.871
Come on! Let's go.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.481
Come on, open it up.

29:50.963 --> 29:53.095
Jane! You okay?

29:53.139 --> 29:54.314
Get rid of her.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.837
Uh, Briana...

29:55.881 --> 29:58.318
I think I'm infected.Oh, my God, Jane!

29:58.361 --> 30:00.886
Stay here!
I'm gonna go get help!

30:02.888 --> 30:04.280
Well, it's not how
I'd have done it,

30:04.324 --> 30:06.587
but I guess
it got the job done.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.722
Almost... got it.

30:15.335 --> 30:16.640
What just happened?!

30:16.684 --> 30:18.904
Boom! Rich.com
just happened,

30:18.947 --> 30:20.470
Milton Dunlop from IT.

30:20.514 --> 30:23.169
Those goobers won't
be going anywhere
any time soon.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.521
Is that branch
from rosemary?

30:27.564 --> 30:29.436
From that BCRU emblem?

30:29.479 --> 30:30.959
It could be.
Rosemary is a healing plant.

30:31.003 --> 30:32.352
Why?

30:34.267 --> 30:35.834
Patterson...

30:35.877 --> 30:38.053
we need to have
another look at the tattoo.

30:38.097 --> 30:39.750
What Why?

30:39.794 --> 30:41.840
'Cause we haven't
solved it yet, that's why?

30:41.883 --> 30:43.929
Try using "rosemary"
as the key.

30:43.972 --> 30:46.105
Okay, well,
if we put "rosemary"

30:46.148 --> 30:48.368
for the Caesar shift,
we get...

30:48.411 --> 30:50.283
...nothing.

30:50.326 --> 30:51.675
Wait, in this recipe,

30:51.719 --> 30:53.329
some of the numbers
are spelled out,

30:53.373 --> 30:54.635
others aren't.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.071
If we can take these digits

30:56.115 --> 30:58.117
and use "rosemary"
to shift them...

30:59.553 --> 31:02.556
...we get "beck BCRU."

31:02.599 --> 31:04.253
So the tattoo points
to Beck's unit

31:04.297 --> 31:05.559
and the smuggler?

31:05.602 --> 31:07.996
Beck's not here
to stop that bio-weapon.

31:09.693 --> 31:11.913
He's the one that made it.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.611
What about the medicine
Beck injected into Laurel?

31:14.655 --> 31:17.527
That's when Laurel was exposed
to whatever killed her.

31:17.571 --> 31:18.789
Beck wasn't trying
to slow the symptoms,

31:18.833 --> 31:19.921
he was trying
to speed them up

31:19.965 --> 31:21.270
to kill her faster!

31:21.314 --> 31:22.924
While masking
the original pathogen.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.970
It was a smokescreen.
He was destroying evidence.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.059
And taking advantage
of this quarantine

31:27.102 --> 31:29.148
to run their own
controlled experiment.

31:29.191 --> 31:32.020
We're not the patients,
we're the lab rats.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.500
Where's Beck now?

31:35.937 --> 31:37.983
This is designed
to slow down your symptoms

31:38.026 --> 31:39.288
and buy us
a little more time

what we're dealing with.

one of Reade's thumbs with you?

Madeline needs done.

Nah.

And if she turned,

39:04.429 --> 39:06.213
it was after
Keaton fired her.

39:06.256 --> 39:10.609
And she had feelings
for you way before that.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.481
Trust me.

39:13.525 --> 39:16.397
She loved you.

39:23.317 --> 39:25.798
And here is
your target file.

39:25.841 --> 39:28.627
Hmm.
Did we get it first?
Did we win?

39:28.670 --> 39:31.412
We sure did.
We're not done, though.

39:31.456 --> 39:32.631
I'll be in touch

39:32.674 --> 39:35.416
about the "next round"
of your audition.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.636
And, um, this?

39:37.679 --> 39:39.768
Keep it.
We're gonna need it.

39:42.510 --> 39:45.905
Okay, seriously,
what's with the narwhals?

39:45.948 --> 39:47.646
You really want to know?

39:47.689 --> 39:51.258
Uh, it's nature's most
misunderstood animal.

39:51.301 --> 39:53.913
Their so-called
"unicorn horn"?

39:53.956 --> 39:55.871
It's not a horn,
it's a tooth.

39:55.915 --> 39:59.309
And it's not a weapon.
It's how they talk.

39:59.353 --> 40:01.442
The biggest threat
to their survival

40:01.486 --> 40:05.664
isn't predators,
it's... their isolation.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.411
Kurt, um...
Stop.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.543
I know what you're gonna say.
"I told you so."

40:15.587 --> 40:18.503
No, I was gonna say I looked
into this photo for you.

40:18.546 --> 40:20.505
The woman's name
is Violet Park.

40:20.548 --> 40:22.289
She works at
a non-profit in Jersey

40:22.332 --> 40:24.900
and her record's
completely clean.

40:28.513 --> 40:29.905
Thank you.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.953
Why don't you seem happy
to tell me this?

40:36.434 --> 40:37.522
It's not
what I found,

40:37.565 --> 40:39.959
it's the reason
I looked into it.

40:40.002 --> 40:41.569
There's something
that's been, uh...

40:41.613 --> 40:44.529
bugging me about today.
About Jane.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.792
When you got to
her quarantine zone,

40:46.835 --> 40:48.620
she didn't stop you
from going in.

40:48.663 --> 40:50.491
She didn't even try.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.537
That's not
the Jane I know.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.630
You know,
you can't just hug him

40:58.673 --> 41:00.501
every time
he gets suspicious.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.242
I can handle Weller.

41:02.285 --> 41:03.852
That's what you said
three years ago.

41:03.896 --> 41:07.856
And yet here you are,
making the same mistakes.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.641
That's not true.

41:09.684 --> 41:12.513
At least Jane had amnesia
when she killed Oscar,

41:12.557 --> 41:13.645
when she killed me.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.255
You've already
killed Dolan.

41:15.298 --> 41:16.561
Who's next?
Shepherd?

41:17.605 --> 41:20.739
Jane didn't kill you,
Roman, you did,

41:20.782 --> 41:22.741
when you fell for
the boss's daughter.

41:22.784 --> 41:26.396
When I went under as Jane,
you fell apart.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.007
Because you are weak.

41:28.050 --> 41:30.400
And that is why
you are dead.

41:30.444 --> 41:32.490
You know, if I
really was Roman

41:32.533 --> 41:34.666
I'd be very hurt
right now.

41:34.709 --> 41:35.580
I don't care what
you are.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.495
I'm not gonna
wait around

41:37.538 --> 41:39.409
and watch you screw up
another mission.

41:39.453 --> 41:40.715
Then go.

41:40.759 --> 41:43.457
Stop bothering me,
stop following me!

41:43.501 --> 41:45.981
Just get out
of my head!

42:00.909 --> 42:03.433
♪♪

42:09.483 --> 42:11.529
Let her go.

42:21.147 --> 42:24.542
♪♪

42:49.741 --> 42:51.220
Greg, move your head.
