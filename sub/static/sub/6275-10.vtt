WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:14.250
TERRY:
Daryll "Black Irish" Donovan?

00:14.333 --> 00:16.250
MICKEY:
Yeah, he's black

00:16.333 --> 00:17.583
and he's Irish.

00:17.667 --> 00:18.959
(laughing):
What do you want?

00:19.583 --> 00:22.000
Why me, Raymond?

00:22.083 --> 00:23.250
'Cause I want
the last person he sees

00:23.333 --> 00:24.750
to hate him as much as I do.

00:24.834 --> 00:27.792
I'm doing this thing my way
using my tools.

00:27.875 --> 00:29.333
SEAN: How the fuck did he breach
my security?

00:29.417 --> 00:32.250
RAY: It's my problem,
and I'm gonna take care of it.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.417
(grunting)

00:34.500 --> 00:35.542
The priest
that molested Bunchy--

00:35.625 --> 00:38.625
they moved him out
of that parish ten years ago.

00:38.709 --> 00:39.667
You killed his brother,
you moron.

00:39.750 --> 00:42.166
I write, too.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.250
Maybe we could collaborate
on something.

00:44.333 --> 00:46.041
I don't think
I could fuck you.

00:46.125 --> 00:47.250
You're too old for me.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.750
How about a blow job?

00:48.834 --> 00:50.625
You'd have to put
a gun to my head.

00:50.709 --> 00:53.125
Get on your knees.
God.

00:53.208 --> 00:56.375
MICKEY:
I optioned my life rights
to Sean Walker.

00:56.458 --> 00:58.250
This movie is gonna be
fucking huge.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.542
Amen, motherfucker.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.542
(laughter)

01:01.625 --> 01:03.250
I'll buy you
anything you want.

01:03.333 --> 01:04.917
What I want,
you can't give me.

01:05.000 --> 01:05.834
Try me.

01:05.917 --> 01:08.250
Emotional honesty.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.417
Oh, geez.

01:19.792 --> 01:21.917
(shovel scraping)

01:35.583 --> 01:38.417
(panting)

01:47.208 --> 01:48.333
(panting continues)

02:00.333 --> 02:00.959
(grunting)
MICKEY:
Up the middle.

02:01.041 --> 02:03.166
On the side, down the pipe.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.125
All right,
now dig in those punches.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.041
Dig in, dig, dig, dig.

02:07.125 --> 02:08.917
There you go. Chop that tree.

02:09.000 --> 02:09.625
He is going down.

02:09.709 --> 02:12.291
Boom!

02:33.917 --> 02:36.625
CONOR: Hey.
Hey.

02:36.709 --> 02:39.166
What are you doing?

02:39.250 --> 02:39.625
Look at this.

02:39.709 --> 02:42.083
(chuckles)

02:42.166 --> 02:43.709
You and Uncle Terry
used to box?

02:43.792 --> 02:45.709
Yeah, Bunchy, too.

02:45.792 --> 02:48.417
He hated it.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.041
(both laugh)

02:50.125 --> 02:52.625
You know what my father used
to do if we ever lost a fight?

02:52.709 --> 02:53.875
Grandpa?

02:53.959 --> 02:55.834
Yeah.

02:55.917 --> 02:58.458
He beat us till we were
black and blue,

02:58.542 --> 03:00.250
teach us to take
a proper punch.

03:00.333 --> 03:01.417
Did you cry?

03:03.125 --> 03:04.792
Did I cr...?
No, I didn't cry.

03:04.875 --> 03:07.834
Made us not want to lose,

03:07.917 --> 03:10.041
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.375
Yeah.

03:24.667 --> 03:27.000
Might want to untie those first.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.750
(chuckles)

03:33.709 --> 03:36.667
(knocking)

03:47.709 --> 03:48.667
Ezra.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.583
Come in.

03:53.792 --> 03:55.208
Is he expecting you?

03:55.291 --> 03:56.375
No, dear.

04:00.417 --> 04:01.083
Hi.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.875
He's upstairs; I'll get him.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.750
You gonna teach me?

04:12.834 --> 04:14.792
What do you want
to learn to fight for?

04:14.875 --> 04:17.500
Because you did.

04:17.583 --> 04:19.333
(chuckles)

04:19.417 --> 04:20.583
Come here.

04:26.291 --> 04:28.458
(sighs)
You know,

04:28.542 --> 04:31.166
you're the last male Donovan.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.625
Yeah.

04:32.709 --> 04:34.458
You have to have some boys
of your own,

04:34.542 --> 04:34.917
keep the family name alive.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.083
ABBY:
Ray?

04:40.667 --> 04:42.500
Ezra's here.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.834
Conor, go get dressed.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.875
This place is too fucking hot.

05:03.959 --> 05:05.709
You think this is hot?

05:05.792 --> 05:08.375
It's 106 degrees
in the Maldives.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.542
I Googled it.

05:09.625 --> 05:10.834
When do we get the passports?

05:10.917 --> 05:12.291
After we're done.

05:12.375 --> 05:12.959
You're still taking me
with you, right?

05:13.041 --> 05:14.542
(laughing):
Uh, yeah.

05:14.625 --> 05:17.500
Fucking sharks will love
you over there, Big Gulp.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.333
The Indian Ocean
is full of them.

05:19.417 --> 05:21.291
What?

05:21.375 --> 05:23.875
You're a walking
fucking billboard,

05:23.959 --> 05:25.959
and I'm supposed
to be invisible, remember?

05:26.041 --> 05:28.333
(knocking)

05:29.709 --> 05:31.542
I'll get it.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.583
Oh, fucking finally.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.542
Fuck this town.

05:38.625 --> 05:39.583
I had to walk at
least seven blocks

05:39.667 --> 05:42.583
before I could find a
store that sold real meat.

05:42.667 --> 05:43.166
Fucking tofu.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.583
SULLY:
Yeah, well...

05:45.667 --> 05:48.500
I walked back from
this Venice Beach.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.959
I never saw so many
freaks in my whole life.

05:51.041 --> 05:54.959
I had one guy shouting

05:55.041 --> 05:56.750
at his own fucking shoe.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.250
(all laughing)

05:59.333 --> 06:01.041
Oh, my God.
Talking to his shoe.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.166
(indistinct chatter)

06:25.083 --> 06:28.417
It's all there.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.792
Where'd you get it?

06:30.875 --> 06:33.250
Ruth's foundation.

06:33.333 --> 06:34.959
Jesus, Ezra.

06:35.041 --> 06:36.792
I couldn't take it
out of the business.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.208
Lee would have a heart attack.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.500
This is her legacy, Raymond,

06:40.583 --> 06:42.000
but there won't be a legacy

06:42.083 --> 06:43.583
if I'm dead
and you're in prison.

06:43.667 --> 06:44.834
You're not dying.

06:44.917 --> 06:45.834
Not yet.

06:45.917 --> 06:47.417
Listen to me.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.458
You got out of Boston.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.375
You built a good life.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.375
You have a beautiful family.

06:53.458 --> 06:56.583
Don't let Mickey poison this.

06:59.083 --> 07:01.959
I saw something in you, Raymond.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.792
Don't let me down.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.667
I won't.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.834
When does he get it?

07:11.917 --> 07:13.875
Tonight.

07:13.959 --> 07:15.166
Where will you be?

07:15.250 --> 07:17.709
Fite Nite at the gym.

07:17.792 --> 07:19.333
Sully's gonna call me
when it's done.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.041
Well, make sure you stay there
until he does.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.208
That's your alibi.

07:22.291 --> 07:24.417
Coffee?
Oh, no, thank you, Abby.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.834
I was just leaving.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.709
We did the right thing then,

07:28.792 --> 07:31.667
and we're doing the
right thing now.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.583
For everyone.

07:43.166 --> 07:46.917
(door opens)

07:47.000 --> 07:48.709
(door closes)

07:57.583 --> 08:00.792
(priest speaking indistinctly)

08:02.542 --> 08:02.834
Father?

08:02.917 --> 08:05.083
Yes?

08:05.166 --> 08:07.291
Remember me?

08:07.375 --> 08:09.959
(chuckling):
I'm sorry. Who...

08:10.041 --> 08:11.709
Who are you?

08:11.792 --> 08:13.041
It's me, Father Danny.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.667
It's Brendan.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.500
Brendan Donovan.

08:17.583 --> 08:19.542
Miguel,

08:19.625 --> 08:22.458
go-go wait in the car.

08:22.542 --> 08:25.291
I think there must be
some mistake.

08:25.375 --> 08:26.792
(car door closes)

08:26.875 --> 08:28.792
No mistake.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.166
It's you.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.417
(chuckles)

08:32.500 --> 08:35.041
We don't know each other.

08:35.125 --> 08:37.792
I-I'm sorry.

08:37.875 --> 08:38.750
Are you?

08:45.792 --> 08:48.500
(sighs)

08:52.667 --> 08:54.750
(engine starts)

09:03.125 --> 09:06.125
(stomping)

09:06.208 --> 09:08.667
(breathing heavily)

09:08.750 --> 09:09.834
(exhales)

09:12.417 --> 09:13.709
He's coming at you,
coming at you.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.458
He's gonna try to
slip, get inside.

09:15.542 --> 09:17.250
Boom, boom,
you know what I mean?

09:17.333 --> 09:18.542
But you are gonna slip him.

09:18.625 --> 09:22.625
Boom. Oh, no, sucker,
you're coming in.

09:22.709 --> 09:23.041
Boom!

09:23.125 --> 09:25.291
Out.

09:25.375 --> 09:26.333
The man is out.

09:26.417 --> 09:28.125
What is this bullshit?

09:28.208 --> 09:29.834
It's pasta.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.125
You know what we used
to eat in the day?
What?

09:32.208 --> 09:34.959
We used to chip in
so that the contender

09:35.041 --> 09:38.125
could eat a fucking
steak, rare.

09:38.208 --> 09:39.583
Enough of this bullshit.

09:39.667 --> 09:39.959
Hey, come on, man.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.000
Hey, Terry.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.291
Yo.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.959
Bring that thing we got
for Daryll.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.375
So, how you feel, champ?

09:48.458 --> 09:50.375
(sighs)
You ready?

09:50.458 --> 09:52.583
Yeah, I'm ready.

09:52.667 --> 09:54.625
That's good Boston blood

09:54.709 --> 09:57.083
coursing through your veins.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.834
Here, here's
something for you.

09:58.917 --> 10:00.333
What's that?

10:00.417 --> 10:02.542
Wait till you see this.

10:04.959 --> 10:06.834
Look at that.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.458
Wow.

10:10.542 --> 10:11.834
(chuckles)

10:11.917 --> 10:14.000
Best of both worlds, huh?

10:14.083 --> 10:16.917
Holy shit.

10:19.208 --> 10:22.792
Thanks, guys.
I appreciate it.

10:22.875 --> 10:24.667
Oh, man.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.458
Listen, the guy you're fighting
tonight is a real comer.

10:28.542 --> 10:30.041
He's 13-2.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.458
He's going pro
after tonight.

10:32.542 --> 10:34.125
Okay, no problem.
No.

10:34.208 --> 10:37.000
It is a problem,
Daryll, all right?

10:37.083 --> 10:38.875
Now, don't get cocky.

10:38.959 --> 10:39.875
Okay, I get it, Terry.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.208
Just put everything
out of your mind.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.834
Get some rest today.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.667
I'll see you later.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.208
You're coming back, right?

10:52.291 --> 10:54.709
Listen to me.

10:54.792 --> 10:58.500
You made a trip cross-country
on a fucking bus.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.917
15 years old,
skinny little kid.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.208
Walked right into Walpole,
asking to see me.

11:03.291 --> 11:05.500
That took fucking guts.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.959
You were there for me.

11:09.041 --> 11:12.041
I'm there for you.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.000
Next time you see me,

11:15.083 --> 11:16.834
I'll have my glad rags on.
(laughs)

11:19.750 --> 11:21.208
(phone rings)

11:23.208 --> 11:25.667
Yeah.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.333
Oh, didn't expect to hear

11:27.417 --> 11:31.125
from you again, sweetheart.

11:31.208 --> 11:33.291
Sure.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.792
Sounds good to me.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.667
Good.

11:47.959 --> 11:48.875
Hey, Bunch.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.041
Ray was right.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.458
What?

11:52.542 --> 11:53.667
You killed
the wrong fucking guy, Pop.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.959
What the fuck
are you talking about?

11:57.041 --> 11:58.458
Father Danny.

11:58.542 --> 12:00.166
He's here in L.A.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.625
I seen him.

12:01.709 --> 12:03.500
Aw, you're imagining things.

12:03.583 --> 12:05.583
Jesus fucking Christ, boy!

12:05.667 --> 12:08.125
How many years you gonna
feel sorry for yourself?

12:08.208 --> 12:09.166
Stop being a crybaby.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.041
Be a man. Deal with it.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.959
Deal with it.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.834
What was Ezra doing here?

12:38.917 --> 12:42.375
He never comes here.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.709
You're gorgeous.
You know that?

12:47.333 --> 12:48.000
Do you know how
beautiful you are?

13:09.083 --> 13:11.667
Let's make another baby.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.959
(laughs)

13:14.041 --> 13:15.375
Are you fucking kidding me?

13:15.458 --> 13:17.041
No, I'm not kidding.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.709
Come on.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.458
I want to make
another little Donovan.

13:20.542 --> 13:24.083
You think a Band-Aid baby's
gonna solve all our problems?

13:24.166 --> 13:26.166
Dream on, buster.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.208
Sleepless nights at my age?

13:28.291 --> 13:29.709
You fucking kidding me?

13:29.792 --> 13:32.417
I want a house.
I know you want a house.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.375
In Trousdale.
(scoffs)

13:35.458 --> 13:37.125
Trousdale, huh?

13:37.208 --> 13:40.208
My little Southie girl's
got expensive taste.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.500
(laughs)

13:42.583 --> 13:45.542
Come on.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.125
Let's make another baby.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.583
(laughing)

14:01.667 --> 14:04.125
What's going on
with you, Ray?

14:04.208 --> 14:05.417
What do you mean?

14:05.500 --> 14:06.917
Why are we going
to Fite Nite?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.083
I told you.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.250
It's time the kids got to know

14:09.333 --> 14:09.625
their family better.

14:09.709 --> 14:12.208
Since when?

14:12.291 --> 14:14.000
Is Mick gonna be there?

14:18.792 --> 14:20.375
I don't know.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.417
Probably.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.750
What's your point?

14:25.834 --> 14:28.750
The last time you were
all together,

14:28.834 --> 14:30.500
you pulled a gun on him.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.083
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

14:32.166 --> 14:33.083
I want to know

14:33.166 --> 14:33.500
how you and Mick resolved it.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.667
Resolved it?

14:37.041 --> 14:38.959
(laughs)

14:39.041 --> 14:41.291
(sighs)

14:43.750 --> 14:45.250
What do you think?

14:45.333 --> 14:47.667
I don't want
my kids getting hurt.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.000
You fucking understand me, Ray?

14:50.083 --> 14:51.166
I don't want them exposed.

14:52.542 --> 14:55.250
They won't be.

14:57.208 --> 15:00.000
I promise.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.000
(indistinct chatter)

15:23.917 --> 15:26.166
Surprised to hear from you.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.542
What you did to me
was heinous.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.166
Do you understand?

15:30.250 --> 15:31.500
I was traumatized.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.875
It was a horrible thing.

15:33.959 --> 15:36.208
I could have
called the police.

15:36.291 --> 15:39.125
I could have
pressed charges.

15:39.208 --> 15:41.542
Yeah, well, you didn't.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.250
Why'd you call me?

15:51.333 --> 15:53.291
I need to know
something.

15:55.583 --> 15:59.166
Have you ever done
that before?

15:59.250 --> 16:00.375
Never.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.250
I would never do that
to a woman.

16:02.333 --> 16:05.250
I'm a feminist.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.750
(chuckles quietly)

16:08.750 --> 16:11.208
I-I need to know

16:11.291 --> 16:14.208
if I asked for that.

16:14.291 --> 16:15.041
I-I...

16:15.125 --> 16:18.333
I have a very dark
shadow side.

16:18.417 --> 16:20.959
And I need to understand

16:21.041 --> 16:22.583
what I'm putting
into the world.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.000
Shadow side, huh?

16:25.083 --> 16:28.041
Me, too.

16:28.125 --> 16:30.208
Hmm.

16:30.291 --> 16:31.458
God...

16:31.542 --> 16:33.166
Mickey...

16:35.792 --> 16:37.959
I've gone to some
very bad places

16:38.041 --> 16:40.208
in my life trying
to be brave.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.500
I hear you.

16:41.583 --> 16:44.792
So have I.

16:44.875 --> 16:47.250
So we have that
in common.

16:47.333 --> 16:48.625
(laughs)

16:48.709 --> 16:49.917
In spades.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.792
The stories I could tell you.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.917
Stories I could tell.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.834
Look.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.834
I really was following
your lead.

17:02.917 --> 17:05.583
I thought that's what you...

17:05.667 --> 17:08.083
that's what you wanted.
(laughs)

17:26.375 --> 17:28.625
That's for you.

17:28.709 --> 17:29.834
What is it?

17:29.917 --> 17:31.792
Here you go, sweetheart.

17:31.875 --> 17:34.166
What's this for, Daddy?

17:34.250 --> 17:37.834
What, I need a reason to
treat my favorite girls?

17:40.375 --> 17:43.458
Diamond studs
from Tiffany, Ray?

17:43.542 --> 17:46.125
It's an important day.

17:46.208 --> 17:47.625
Why?

17:47.709 --> 17:49.291
BRIDGET:
We're meeting
Uncle Daryll today.

17:49.375 --> 17:50.500
He's fighting.

17:50.583 --> 17:51.625
What's he like?

17:51.709 --> 17:54.291
ABBY:
He's nice.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.583
I think you'll like him.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.792
CONOR:
Dad?

17:57.875 --> 17:59.625
How old were you
when you started boxing?

17:59.709 --> 18:01.208
I don't know.

18:01.291 --> 18:04.792
I was wearing gloves
before I could walk.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.709
Did you have
a boxing name?

18:06.792 --> 18:07.375
(laughs)

18:07.458 --> 18:09.166
What do you need that for?

18:09.250 --> 18:13.667
You do your talking in the
ring, not on a poster.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.500
Come on, did you have
any nicknames, Daddy?

18:15.583 --> 18:17.709
Nope.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.667
I was always
Mickey's boy.

18:19.750 --> 18:23.500
Heir to the throne.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.959
(indistinct chatter)

18:29.417 --> 18:30.291
TERRY:
Hey.

18:33.417 --> 18:34.875
I didn't think you'd come.

18:34.959 --> 18:37.166
Why not? I said
we were coming.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.208
You look nice, Abby.

18:42.291 --> 18:42.709
Great turnout.
Yeah.

18:42.792 --> 18:45.667
Hey! Here you go.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.250
Try these on.

18:50.291 --> 18:52.417
Thank you.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.875
Where's Grandpa?

18:53.959 --> 18:54.917
Why don't you
introduce yourself

18:55.000 --> 18:55.917
to your new uncle?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.875
Oh, where is he?

18:58.959 --> 19:01.375
Which one is he, Dad?

19:01.458 --> 19:03.875
Right there.

19:06.417 --> 19:08.500
How can he be our uncle?

19:08.583 --> 19:10.208
Oh, my God,
you're a moron.

19:10.291 --> 19:12.125
He has a different mom.

19:12.208 --> 19:15.125
I still don't understand.
(scoffs)

19:15.208 --> 19:18.500
He's half-black,
sweetheart.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.125
Buy you a drink?

19:21.208 --> 19:21.750
Yeah.

19:21.834 --> 19:24.375
Can we get
two whiskeys?

19:24.458 --> 19:26.291
You got it.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.458
What's up with him?

19:31.542 --> 19:33.291
I don't know.

19:33.375 --> 19:36.083
He's been acting weird lately.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.917
Either he's out all day
and no one knows where he is

19:38.000 --> 19:39.667
or he just sleeps.

19:39.750 --> 19:42.000
Sláinte.

19:42.083 --> 19:43.291
Sláinte.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.917
I'm surprised
I could fuck you.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.458
You're really
not my type.

19:53.542 --> 19:57.000
My tits are real,
by the way.

19:57.083 --> 20:00.834
And my bony white ass didn't
seem to bother you, Mick.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.291
(exhales)

20:02.375 --> 20:05.583
Yeah, life is full
of surprises.

20:06.667 --> 20:07.500
Where you going?

20:07.583 --> 20:10.458
Home.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.041
I just needed some closure
on this with you.

20:14.667 --> 20:15.834
Hang out for a little while.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.291
Come on, you're fun.

20:17.375 --> 20:21.375
Wait 20 minutes,
you get some more closure.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.125
Nah, this is what it was.

20:23.208 --> 20:26.083
Going home.

20:29.917 --> 20:31.417
Now, where did
I put my bag?

20:35.834 --> 20:37.208
(Linda screams)

20:47.083 --> 20:48.166
(crying)

20:56.458 --> 20:58.083
SULLY:
Put on some clothes, Mick.

20:58.166 --> 21:03.041
We're going for a drive.

21:25.208 --> 21:26.875
You moving in?

21:28.208 --> 21:29.667
What, do you miss me?

21:38.959 --> 21:41.792
How's the door?

21:41.875 --> 21:43.875
Not bad.

21:43.959 --> 21:45.792
Should be enough for the next
few months' rent on the gym.

21:45.875 --> 21:46.792
Keep it.

21:46.875 --> 21:49.083
I don't need it.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.041
You may not need it,
but I owe it.

21:52.542 --> 21:53.458
I pay my debts.
(snorts)

21:55.792 --> 21:57.542
Relax. I didn't say you didn't.

21:59.792 --> 22:00.667
Come on, Terry.

22:00.750 --> 22:04.250
It's your big night.
Go have some fun.

22:04.333 --> 22:07.625
What's going on with you, Ray?
I've been doing

22:07.709 --> 22:10.083
Fite Nite for years.
You come, what,

22:10.166 --> 22:11.875
three times?

22:11.959 --> 22:12.917
Why tonight?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.083
(chuckles)

22:16.166 --> 22:17.417
Where's Mick?

22:17.500 --> 22:19.583
I don't know.

22:19.667 --> 22:21.834
He got a call earlier.

22:21.917 --> 22:24.166
Sounded like he was hooking up
with some broad.

22:24.250 --> 22:26.417
He'll be here.

22:26.500 --> 22:29.000
He wouldn't miss Daryll's fight
for the world.

22:29.083 --> 22:31.750
Don't be so sure.

22:31.834 --> 22:32.375
What's that supposed to mean?

22:32.458 --> 22:36.375
Means don't be so sure.

22:36.458 --> 22:39.125
When has he ever been there
for any of us?

22:41.208 --> 22:42.917
He's changed.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.208
No, I really
think he has.

22:45.291 --> 22:46.583
You should talk to him.

22:46.667 --> 22:50.750
Yeah... maybe I should.

22:50.834 --> 22:51.583
(sighs)

22:54.834 --> 22:57.166
(sobbing)

22:59.041 --> 23:00.000
Well, look, this
about the money I took

23:00.083 --> 23:01.625
in the robbery?

23:04.875 --> 23:05.667
Long time ago, Sully.

23:08.417 --> 23:10.959
Did it for a chick.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.959
Yeah, the fucking nigger.

23:14.041 --> 23:16.041
Love is love.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.917
We had a kid.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.208
Ought to take
care of your own.

23:19.291 --> 23:23.834
My mother always said that.

23:23.917 --> 23:27.166
How is your mother?

23:27.250 --> 23:29.458
She's all right.
Thanks for asking.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.041
I always liked her.

23:30.125 --> 23:33.417
She's still alive, huh?

23:35.041 --> 23:38.333
Yeah, she's still alive.

23:39.542 --> 23:41.959
That's a blessing.

23:42.041 --> 23:45.667
Losing your mom--
that's a big one.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.500
That's a big one.

23:47.583 --> 23:50.834
That shit ain't
gonna work, Mick.

23:50.917 --> 23:53.542
So just be a man
and shut the fuck up.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.083
So, how'd you find me?

23:58.166 --> 24:00.250
(chuckles)

24:00.333 --> 24:03.041
I didn't.

24:03.125 --> 24:06.208
Ray found me.

24:16.959 --> 24:18.834
(bell clangs, crowd clamoring)

24:26.875 --> 24:28.875
Hey.
It's a good fight, huh?

24:28.959 --> 24:31.583
Yeah.

24:31.667 --> 24:35.458
We're looking forward
to your fight, Daryll. Right?

24:35.542 --> 24:37.709
Yeah, I can't wait.

24:38.291 --> 24:41.250
When'd you two meet?

24:43.083 --> 24:44.083
I brought the kids by
one day.

24:44.166 --> 24:46.542
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.458
Hey, Ray, can I talk
to you for a second?

24:55.875 --> 24:58.250
Yeah, sure.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.625
What's-What's up
with you, man?

25:02.709 --> 25:04.417
Do you blame me for Mickey
leaving your moms?

25:04.500 --> 25:08.208
I don't blame you.
You weren't born.

25:08.291 --> 25:09.583
I blame him.

25:09.667 --> 25:11.041
Okay, so why'd you have me
beat up?

25:11.125 --> 25:12.250
I think we both know
the answer to that.

25:12.333 --> 25:15.041
I was helping out my pops.

25:15.125 --> 25:18.000
Yeah.

25:18.083 --> 25:22.417
Look, let's, uh, let's put
it aside tonight, all right?

25:22.500 --> 25:23.667
I came here to
see you fight.

25:30.667 --> 25:32.750
Hey!

25:32.834 --> 25:36.125
I didn't bring my son here
to see a Donovan lose.

25:36.208 --> 25:38.000
All right?

25:38.083 --> 25:39.458
All right.

25:39.542 --> 25:41.500
Kick his ass.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.583
What was that about?

25:53.667 --> 25:56.125
Don't worry about it.

25:56.208 --> 25:59.000
Okay, I won't.

25:59.083 --> 26:01.625
I'm gonna get
another beer...

26:01.709 --> 26:02.041
Ray the Rocket.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.291
What?

26:03.375 --> 26:06.291
You did have
a nickname.

26:06.375 --> 26:09.792
That's what me and the
girls used to call you.

26:09.875 --> 26:11.583
Ray the Rocket.

26:11.667 --> 26:13.291
(chuckles)

26:26.625 --> 26:28.291
SULLY:
Come on, get out,
get the fuck out.

26:28.375 --> 26:30.458
Stay right there.

26:30.542 --> 26:31.917
Don't fucking move.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Please, God!
Please, God!

26:34.083 --> 26:35.375
(sobbing)

26:35.458 --> 26:37.333
Get up!

26:37.417 --> 26:39.625
Shut her up.

26:39.709 --> 26:41.667
Got her?

26:41.750 --> 26:43.458
What was I supposed to do?

26:43.542 --> 26:46.458
I was in prison.
I had to save my skin.

26:46.542 --> 26:48.333
I know what you did.

26:48.417 --> 26:50.291
You ratted out
my whole family.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.959
Poor Robbie, dying of
the virus in there.

26:53.041 --> 26:54.208
It wasn't my fault.

26:54.291 --> 26:55.333
He got AIDS before
I ratted him out.

26:55.417 --> 26:56.750
He was a secret fag.
Yeah.

26:56.834 --> 26:59.333
Taking it up the ass
in secret. Come on.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.166
All right, he was
half a fag.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.333
I walked in
on him once.

27:03.417 --> 27:05.041
Scared the shit
out of me.

27:05.125 --> 27:07.625
I didn't know what the
fuck they were doing.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.250
It is confusing.

27:09.333 --> 27:11.041
Up here. Go on.

27:11.125 --> 27:14.834
I'm still working
for the FBI.

27:14.917 --> 27:15.542
That's a big fucking surprise,
Mick.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.917
Another good reason to kill you.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.792
That's why
they let me out early.

27:19.875 --> 27:21.709
They wanted me
to help them bring down

27:21.792 --> 27:22.417
Ray and his boss
Ezra Goldman,

27:22.500 --> 27:24.875
the fuckers
that set me up.

27:24.959 --> 27:26.667
Set you up for what?

27:26.750 --> 27:28.583
Doesn't matter.

27:28.667 --> 27:31.125
But it probably explains
why Ray hired you

27:31.208 --> 27:33.709
to kill me
and didn't do it himself.

27:33.792 --> 27:35.583
What are you getting at?

27:35.667 --> 27:37.625
He knows the feds
are watching him.

27:37.709 --> 27:40.667
Maybe he's trying
to set you up, too.

27:40.750 --> 27:45.208
Just talking
a load of shit, Mick.

27:45.291 --> 27:47.667
Just a load of shit.

27:59.542 --> 28:00.709
Mmm. Thanks.

28:00.792 --> 28:01.875
Yeah, no problem.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.208
What the fuck are
you doing here?

28:06.291 --> 28:08.333
I'm here to collect
the money once it's done.

28:08.417 --> 28:09.583
That's not the deal.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.041
I'm supposed to
bring it to you.

28:11.125 --> 28:14.000
Yeah, well, uh,
Sully don't trust you.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.291
Sully can go
fuck himself.

28:15.375 --> 28:17.041
I'm here, Ray.

28:17.125 --> 28:18.083
If I leave,
it don't get done.

28:18.166 --> 28:20.709
Your choice.

28:22.291 --> 28:24.208
Bunchy, what's the matter?

28:24.291 --> 28:26.375
Nothing. I'm fine.
Bunch...

28:26.458 --> 28:30.458
You stay away
from my family, you hear me?

28:36.542 --> 28:38.750
What's going on, Bunch?

28:38.834 --> 28:40.834
He's upset.

28:40.917 --> 28:42.458
RAY:
What are you
upset about?

28:42.542 --> 28:43.625
The whole family's here.

28:43.709 --> 28:45.166
I thought that's
what you wanted.

28:45.250 --> 28:46.583
We're not all here, are we?

28:46.667 --> 28:49.583
What's that
supposed to mean?

28:49.667 --> 28:50.667
(sniffs)

28:50.750 --> 28:54.667
Terry said Mick
was out with some broad.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.875
Who the fuck knows?
Maybe he took off again.

28:56.959 --> 28:58.750
What the fuck
are you talking about?

28:58.834 --> 29:00.959
He wouldn't leave us.

29:08.583 --> 29:12.166
You got a short memory,
don't you, Bunch?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.166
Forget about Claudette?

29:14.250 --> 29:15.667
Hmm?

29:15.750 --> 29:17.625
Poor Mom dying
in front of us

29:17.709 --> 29:20.000
while he's across town
screwing her?

29:20.083 --> 29:22.625
You don't remember me and Terry
cooking and cleaning for you?

29:22.709 --> 29:27.166
Taking you and Bridget
to school?

29:27.250 --> 29:30.417
'Cause I sure fucking do.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.542
Kneel down, honey.

29:35.625 --> 29:37.166
This is gonna be
over fast.

29:37.250 --> 29:38.709
(Linda crying)

29:38.792 --> 29:41.291
MICKEY:
It's not the way things

29:41.375 --> 29:42.500
are done, Sully. You know that.

29:42.583 --> 29:45.208
You kill a woman
for passion,

29:45.291 --> 29:48.000
not business. This is business.
She don't belong here.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.667
(crying):
My ex-husband
is very, very rich.

29:50.750 --> 29:51.333
He'll pay you.

29:51.417 --> 29:52.542
Yeah?

29:52.625 --> 29:55.083
LINDA:
Please.
Please.

29:55.166 --> 29:55.792
How much?

29:55.875 --> 29:58.417
LINDA:
How much
do you want?

29:58.500 --> 30:01.375
100 grand.

30:01.458 --> 30:04.041
Anything. He'll...

30:04.125 --> 30:06.333
he'll pay you
anything.

30:08.291 --> 30:10.375
Cut her loose.

30:10.458 --> 30:11.667
She's a witness.
Just do it.

30:11.750 --> 30:14.208
(sighs)

30:14.291 --> 30:17.208
Oh...

30:17.291 --> 30:18.000
Come on.
(grunts)

30:19.875 --> 30:22.375
SULLY:
Come on.
Come here.

30:22.458 --> 30:23.750
Now, sweetheart,

30:23.834 --> 30:25.709
I want you to walk
back down to the car.

30:25.792 --> 30:27.792
Do you know the way?
Yes.

30:27.875 --> 30:29.291
Do you?
Yes!

30:29.375 --> 30:31.875
All right, now,
you wait there for us.
Okay.

30:31.959 --> 30:35.208
All right.
Now go ahead.
(sobs)

30:35.291 --> 30:36.917
Thank you.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.250
All right.
Go ahead.

30:38.333 --> 30:40.291
(exhales)

30:40.375 --> 30:42.125
(crying)

30:48.125 --> 30:49.959
What the fuck?

30:54.667 --> 30:57.083
I needed you to see that, Mick.

30:57.625 --> 30:59.583
An eye for an eye.

30:59.667 --> 31:01.500
What are you talking about?

31:01.583 --> 31:05.208
Never mind.

31:05.291 --> 31:07.667
Come on. Throw her in.

31:12.083 --> 31:15.083
(steadying breaths, grunts)

31:21.375 --> 31:24.750
(grunting)

31:31.583 --> 31:35.125
Stand by the hole,
Mick.

31:42.583 --> 31:44.709
Come on, Sully.

31:44.792 --> 31:47.834
Don't-don't throw me in
with her.

31:47.917 --> 31:51.083
I hardly knew the broad.
(chuckles)

31:51.166 --> 31:54.041
Fucked her
for the first time today.

31:55.250 --> 31:57.166
All right.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.125
(sighs)

31:59.208 --> 32:00.792
Dig another hole for Mickey.

32:04.583 --> 32:07.959
(indistinct chatter)

32:20.500 --> 32:23.500
Who's the toughest
Donovan, Uncle Bunch?

32:24.458 --> 32:28.166
I don't know.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.166
I know it's not me.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.500
Your pop and Uncle Terry
ever start scrapping,

32:32.583 --> 32:33.959
I won't get in the way.

32:34.041 --> 32:35.500
Is Dad really that tough?

32:35.583 --> 32:36.917
Are you kidding me?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.667
Really?
Yeah.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.750
Had a big reputation
back in Southie.

32:44.458 --> 32:48.000
Lot of people saying he was
gonna be tougher than Mickey.

32:48.875 --> 32:50.792
What about Uncle Daryll?

32:50.875 --> 32:53.583
Is he tough?
I don't know.

32:53.667 --> 32:56.291
Maybe.

32:56.375 --> 32:59.291
He's only half a Donovan, but...

32:59.375 --> 33:01.959
he's probably... tough.

33:03.500 --> 33:06.709
Tougher than me.

33:06.792 --> 33:10.375
Everybody's tougher than me.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.125
Listen to me.

33:19.458 --> 33:23.291
You need to be as tough
as your old man

33:23.375 --> 33:27.375
'cause there's
some fucking snakes out there.

33:30.375 --> 33:33.083
Don't ever let anybody
take advantage of you.

33:33.166 --> 33:33.667
You hear me?

33:33.750 --> 33:37.458
Okay, I won't.

33:38.458 --> 33:41.041
Good.

33:43.458 --> 33:46.750
(grunting)

33:46.834 --> 33:47.875
It was Ray's idea...

33:47.959 --> 33:50.083
to disappear me or yours?

33:50.166 --> 33:54.625
Bit of both.
Ray didn't want his kids...

33:54.709 --> 33:57.417
seeing Grandpa's dead body
on the news.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.625
Me?

33:58.709 --> 34:01.250
I'm a professional.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.750
TINY:
This is bullshit.

34:02.834 --> 34:05.041
He should dig his own grave.

34:05.125 --> 34:07.333
Thanks for this.

34:07.417 --> 34:08.875
Appreciate it.

34:09.792 --> 34:11.166
I don't want to get...

34:11.250 --> 34:15.291
torn apart by wild animals.
(chuckles)

34:15.375 --> 34:16.875
Remember that? Us?

34:16.959 --> 34:21.125
(chuckles)
Who was that guy...

34:21.208 --> 34:24.500
that guy we didn't
bury right? Uh, Sam...

34:24.583 --> 34:26.500
Sam fucking something.

34:26.583 --> 34:28.417
Saul. Saul Hardy.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.667
Saul, that's him.
Saul fucking Hardy.

34:29.750 --> 34:31.917
Yeah.
Well remembered,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.875
huh?
Stray dog dragged his body away.

34:34.959 --> 34:37.834
His femur ended up
down in Dorchester.

34:37.917 --> 34:39.083
S-Some kid was playing
fucking stickball with it.

34:39.166 --> 34:41.750
Hit a double
with Saul's fucking femur.

34:41.834 --> 34:43.250
(both chuckle)

34:43.333 --> 34:45.709
(sniffs, groans, mutters)

34:47.417 --> 34:49.166
Come on, Tiny.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.041
Fuck's sake, it's getting cold
out here. Come on.

34:51.125 --> 34:55.458
(Tiny grunts)
(shoveling continues)

34:55.542 --> 34:57.875
(bell dings)
(cheering)

35:02.000 --> 35:04.834
(cheering and applause)

35:04.917 --> 35:06.709
(Abby whistles loudly)

35:08.291 --> 35:10.125
That's degrading
to women.

35:10.208 --> 35:11.834
Where'd you learn that?
Your feminist theory class?

35:11.917 --> 35:14.208
Don't be
facetious, Mom.

35:14.291 --> 35:18.208
Lighten up, Bridg. I'm just
trying to have some fun.

35:18.291 --> 35:21.208
(cheering and applause)

35:21.291 --> 35:23.333
(laughing):
Conor seems to like her.

35:23.417 --> 35:25.709
Shut up.

35:29.291 --> 35:33.750
Go get a soda.
I want to talk to your dad.

35:42.625 --> 35:45.083
Who's that old guy, Ray?

35:46.959 --> 35:47.792
RAY:
Nobody.

35:47.875 --> 35:50.250
Who is he?
He's nobody.

35:50.333 --> 35:53.083
What's with all the
fucking questions?

35:53.166 --> 35:55.709
REFEREE:
Seconds out.
Mouthpieces in.

35:55.792 --> 35:57.750
Round three coming up.

35:57.834 --> 36:00.625
(bell dings)
(cheering)

36:00.709 --> 36:02.917
Keep moving, Daryll.
You got to stay warm.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.333
Since when do you care
what I do?

36:05.417 --> 36:08.208
Keep fucking moving, Daryll.
Seriously, Terry,
where's Mickey at?

36:08.291 --> 36:10.083
I don't know.
Well, I need him here.

36:10.166 --> 36:12.834
I need him
in my corner.
He'll be here.

36:20.875 --> 36:23.291
(blows landing)

36:31.166 --> 36:34.375
Hi. I'm Abby Donovan.

36:34.458 --> 36:35.417
Yeah. Hi.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.083
ABBY:
It's a good fight, huh?

36:39.166 --> 36:41.417
Eh.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.250
So, how do you know Ray?

36:43.333 --> 36:44.792
Eh, we go back.

36:44.875 --> 36:46.625
You from Southie?

36:46.709 --> 36:49.417
Yeah.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.875
You a friend of Mick's?

37:19.125 --> 37:22.208
Time to do this, Mick.

37:22.291 --> 37:23.375
(grunts)

37:25.375 --> 37:27.458
I understand...

37:27.542 --> 37:29.583
your reasons, Sully.

37:29.667 --> 37:31.208
But Ray.

37:31.291 --> 37:35.709
Did you even
fucking ask him why?

37:35.792 --> 37:37.834
I don't care why, Mick.

37:37.917 --> 37:40.000
Ray's paying me.

37:42.500 --> 37:45.375
But you know what?

37:46.542 --> 37:48.834
I'd gladly do this for free.

37:48.917 --> 37:51.500
Not for the
money you stole.

37:51.583 --> 37:54.709
And not for putting
my whole fucking family away.

37:57.083 --> 37:59.041
But for her.

37:59.125 --> 38:01.500
Who?

38:01.583 --> 38:05.291
Colleen... Dawson.

38:05.375 --> 38:08.125
Ray's old girlfriend?

38:08.208 --> 38:10.417
(chuckles)

38:10.500 --> 38:12.875
You were fucking her, too?

38:12.959 --> 38:16.542
(Mickey grunts)
I wasn't fucking her,
you piece of shit.

38:16.625 --> 38:17.542
I loved her.

38:17.625 --> 38:20.542
Yeah. Yeah, I was seeing her,
fucking too.

38:20.625 --> 38:22.166
(grunts)

38:22.250 --> 38:25.458
Had a little place picked
out in Cohasset for us.

38:25.542 --> 38:29.709
And then you
fucking killed her.

38:29.792 --> 38:30.750
(labored
breathing)

38:30.834 --> 38:34.583
(chuckles)

38:34.667 --> 38:37.083
What's so funny?

38:38.500 --> 38:40.625
You got the wrong guy, pal.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.458
What are you
talking about?

38:42.542 --> 38:44.834
I didn't kill Colleen.

38:44.917 --> 38:45.709
I point a gun
to your head

38:45.792 --> 38:48.542
and you're innocent
all of a sudden?

38:48.625 --> 38:50.250
Get real, Mick.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.417
You went to prison
because of it.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.333
I swear to you
I did not kill that girl.

38:54.417 --> 38:55.625
And I can prove it.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.166
Just fucking shoot him, Sully.

39:00.291 --> 39:02.667

No.

40:49.417 --> 40:52.041
What are you doing?

40:52.125 --> 40:53.583
I'm fucking you.

40:53.667 --> 40:56.041
(panting):
Where's Mick?

41:14.792 --> 41:17.458
You think
I'm stupid?

41:17.542 --> 41:18.667
The bag from Ezra?

41:20.500 --> 41:22.875
The guy from Southie?

41:30.083 --> 41:32.208
What did you do?

41:33.125 --> 41:34.750
I'm sorry.

41:38.166 --> 41:42.208
I'm so fucking sorry.
(sniffles)

41:42.291 --> 41:45.125
Look at me.

41:45.208 --> 41:49.291
Look at me... look at me.

41:49.375 --> 41:51.166
I'm your wife. It's me.

41:51.250 --> 41:55.125
Don't ruin this.

41:57.041 --> 42:00.375
Ray.

42:01.417 --> 42:03.750
(cheering)

42:21.250 --> 42:22.959
Sully just called.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.750
It's been done.

42:24.834 --> 42:27.208
You hear me?

42:28.291 --> 42:30.625
I hear you.

42:30.709 --> 42:32.667
You don't seem too
happy about it.

42:35.709 --> 42:38.083
I'll get you the money.

42:50.208 --> 42:53.583
(cheering)

43:07.333 --> 43:09.291
Yeah!

43:09.375 --> 43:10.500
MAN:
You'd better take my advice
and leave him alone.

43:10.583 --> 43:14.917
Shame, shame, you're a bad boy.

43:15.000 --> 43:20.625
The skunk cage is always
a center of interest.
(doorbell rings)

43:20.709 --> 43:22.166
MICKEY:
Seany-boy.

43:22.250 --> 43:23.667
Are you in there?

43:23.750 --> 43:26.333
It's me, Mickey.
I was in the neighborhood,

43:26.417 --> 43:28.500
and I, uh... I got inspired.

43:28.583 --> 43:30.542
(whispering):
Do you know
what time it is, Mick?

43:30.625 --> 43:33.083
I'm trying to get my baby
to go to sleep.

43:33.166 --> 43:34.166
But I got a great idea
for the ending.

43:34.250 --> 43:36.834
A real humdinger.

43:36.917 --> 43:39.417
(baby cooing)

43:41.375 --> 43:43.125
Let me in.

43:43.208 --> 43:46.875
Let me in.

43:46.959 --> 43:48.834
(beeps)

43:50.125 --> 43:52.417
(indistinct chatter)

44:07.125 --> 44:10.208
(coughing)

44:10.291 --> 44:12.542
(panting):
No.

44:12.625 --> 44:16.917
Mickey, please help me.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I can't, kid.

44:19.083 --> 44:22.375
(gunshot, Sean grunts)

44:22.458 --> 44:23.834
TERRY:
You're the main
event, Daryll.

44:23.917 --> 44:25.875
You can't back out.
People are waiting.

44:25.959 --> 44:28.750
I'm waiting for Mickey.
He said he'd be here.

44:28.834 --> 44:30.250
Geez.

44:30.333 --> 44:32.083
What's going on?

44:32.166 --> 44:33.959
TERRY:
He wants Mick in his corner.

44:34.041 --> 44:35.875
I tried calling him,
but his phone's off.

44:35.959 --> 44:38.792
I told him I'd step up,
but he ain't having it.

44:38.875 --> 44:40.250
It's not the
same, Pie.

44:40.333 --> 44:41.458
Besides, man, you
don't even like me.

44:41.542 --> 44:43.917
Don't be such a pussy, Daryll.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.250
Forget you, old man.
I said I'm waiting for Mick.

44:46.333 --> 44:47.709
RAY:
Fuck Mick.

44:47.792 --> 44:50.125
You don't need him.

44:50.208 --> 44:51.458
You a Donovan or not?

44:51.542 --> 44:53.000
Hell, yeah, I'm a Donovan.

44:53.083 --> 44:56.208
Yeah?

44:56.291 --> 44:58.125
Then, get used to that prick
letting you down.

45:00.500 --> 45:03.792
You get off your ass

45:03.875 --> 45:06.750
and go show those fucking
people who you are.

45:08.750 --> 45:11.917
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

45:16.083 --> 45:18.500
(phone buzzes)

45:21.375 --> 45:24.750
Is everything all right?

45:27.166 --> 45:29.667
Where's Uncle Daryll?

45:29.750 --> 45:32.000
He'll be out soon.

45:32.083 --> 45:33.500
(phone rings)

45:33.583 --> 45:35.750
(phones ringing and chiming)

45:39.083 --> 45:41.291
WOMAN:
Whoa.

45:42.792 --> 45:45.792
NEWS ANCHOR (on TV):
We're just receiving reports
about a major incident

45:45.875 --> 45:48.792
at movie star Sean Walker's home
in Bel Air tonight.

45:48.875 --> 45:51.041
Steve.

45:51.125 --> 45:52.875
STEVE:
Unverified account
that a body has been found.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.834
It's believed to be
the body of Sean Walker,

45:55.917 --> 45:58.792
who burst on the scene with
the cult classic Black Mass

45:58.875 --> 46:00.458
and continued to break

46:00.542 --> 46:03.917
all box office records
with his stream of hit films.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.291
So far
his public relations team...

46:05.375 --> 46:08.291
Shame about
Sean Walker.

46:08.375 --> 46:11.291
Hear there's a
lunatic on the loose.

46:11.375 --> 46:13.041
...never been evidence of wild
parties at the Walker estate

46:13.125 --> 46:18.667
and he has been nothing
but an exemplary neighbor.

46:18.750 --> 46:20.875
This news will obviously come
as a huge shock

46:20.959 --> 46:23.333
to the entire Hollywood
community as well as...

46:23.417 --> 46:25.792
What'd you do?

46:25.875 --> 46:27.667
What did you do?

46:27.750 --> 46:29.208
Raymond, what did you do?

46:29.291 --> 46:32.375
Did you know Sully was fucking
your little girlfriend Colleen

46:32.458 --> 46:34.667
behind your back?

46:34.750 --> 46:37.000
He found out who killed her.

46:37.083 --> 46:38.834
And he knows who
covered it up.

46:38.917 --> 46:40.917
I'd watch your back, kid.

46:47.166 --> 46:49.834
Ray?

46:49.917 --> 46:52.375
Ray!
(footsteps running)

46:52.458 --> 46:54.542
Will you just
fucking stop?

46:54.625 --> 46:56.208
What's going on?

46:56.291 --> 46:57.000
What did you do?

46:57.083 --> 46:59.542
Why don't you
trust me, huh?

46:59.625 --> 47:01.125
I'm your goddamn husband!

47:01.208 --> 47:02.792
Doesn't that fucking
count for something?!

47:02.875 --> 47:06.125
Why are you always
taking his side?!

47:06.208 --> 47:07.500
(panting)

47:07.583 --> 47:10.291
You're wrong about him.

47:10.375 --> 47:12.208
What the fuck are
you talking about?!

47:12.291 --> 47:13.750
I know him!

47:13.834 --> 47:17.083
I wrote to him
for years in Walpole.

47:17.166 --> 47:20.375
I sent him money, I sent him
pictures of the kids.

47:23.166 --> 47:26.125
I was the one who asked him
to come to L.A., Ray.

47:30.083 --> 47:31.500
You don't know what
the fuck you're doing.

47:31.583 --> 47:33.458
(Abby sighs heavily)

47:33.542 --> 47:36.709
(door opens)

47:36.792 --> 47:39.250
(door slams)

47:39.333 --> 47:42.667
(indistinct crowd chatter)

47:42.750 --> 47:46.208
MICKEY:
Abby, me darling.

47:46.291 --> 47:48.625
Sorry I'm late.

47:48.709 --> 47:50.250
Something about, uh,
Ray's client, huh?

47:50.333 --> 47:53.917
Shame.

48:10.083 --> 48:11.625
Mick.

48:11.709 --> 48:14.291
I told you he'd come.
I fucking told you he'd come.

48:14.375 --> 48:15.834
Good to see you, Dad.

48:15.917 --> 48:17.375
You, too, pal.

48:17.458 --> 48:19.083
You, too.

48:21.333 --> 48:23.333
What the fuck happened to you?

48:23.417 --> 48:24.333
Ran into an
old friend.

48:24.417 --> 48:27.333
So, what's going on?
We ready to go or what?

48:27.417 --> 48:28.291
Yeah, yeah, we're ready.

48:28.375 --> 48:29.709
I want to see you
knocking seven bells

48:29.792 --> 48:32.792
of shit out of
that motherfucker.

48:32.875 --> 48:35.041
You hear me?
I fucking hear you.

48:35.125 --> 48:35.709
You hear me?
I hear you, Dad.

48:35.792 --> 48:38.166
(laughing):
You hear me?

48:38.250 --> 48:39.875
Yeah, Terry, huh?

48:40.000 --> 48:41.834
All right, all right,
let's get the focus back.

48:41.917 --> 48:43.959
Get back
into the routine, okay?

48:44.041 --> 48:46.083
POTATO PIE:
Remember the game plan:
stay on this guy.

48:51.792 --> 48:53.291
(crowd cheering)

48:53.375 --> 48:55.291
Vaseline.

48:56.792 --> 48:57.875
(applause and cheering)

48:57.959 --> 48:59.166
Yeah, let's go!

48:59.250 --> 49:00.166
Check your mouthpiece.

49:00.250 --> 49:01.959
All right, good luck.
Go get some, bro.

49:02.041 --> 49:04.500
Okay, don't let
him back you up.

49:04.583 --> 49:07.500
You're a fucking
Donovan, boy.

49:07.583 --> 49:09.959
Huh? Do me proud!

49:11.166 --> 49:12.625
It's your fight.

49:12.709 --> 49:14.834
CROWD (chanting):
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

49:14.917 --> 49:16.375
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

49:16.458 --> 49:18.625
(cheering, bell clangs)

49:18.709 --> 49:20.208
(sighs)

49:20.291 --> 49:22.875
(phone rings)

49:22.959 --> 49:24.542
EZRA:
What happened, Raymond?

49:24.625 --> 49:25.333
(Ray sighs)

49:25.417 --> 49:28.709
Sully.

49:28.792 --> 49:31.208
And Mickey's still alive.

49:31.291 --> 49:33.000
Ruth's money?

49:33.083 --> 49:34.208
Gone.

49:34.291 --> 49:36.583
(sighs)

49:36.667 --> 49:39.041
How are we gonna fix this,
Raymond?
