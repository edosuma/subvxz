WEBVTT

00:58.725 --> 01:00.227
This is perfect.

01:02.729 --> 01:07.109
Okay, so, I normally don't say this
on the first time with boys,

01:07.192 --> 01:13.323
and by "boys" I mean men or guys,
male-presenting people of age.

01:13.407 --> 01:18.078
But I would just like
to put it out there that

01:18.161 --> 01:21.540
I'm fine if this is like
a one-night thing,

01:21.623 --> 01:26.128
and if it's more than one night,
that-- I'm also fine.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.213
So, yeah.

01:28.297 --> 01:32.968
And what would your take on this be?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.805
I don't think this is just one night.

01:37.931 --> 01:41.393
So... two nights?

01:42.352 --> 01:47.524
Melissa, you are gorgeous and funny,
and you're a doctor.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.820
Maybe it's two nights. Maybe three.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.199
I mean, who knows?
Maybe we'll be together forever.

01:55.282 --> 02:01.038
But, for now,
can we just take it one moment at a time?

02:01.830 --> 02:02.831
Yeah.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.124
Yeah, I'm great at that.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.836
So, yeah. Wow. Okay. So, two nights?

02:08.920 --> 02:13.258
Could be two nights. Could be forever.
Could be, you know, anything in between.

02:13.342 --> 02:14.510
Sorry, I'm ruining it.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.802
I'm ruining it.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.769
I don't understand. Why couldn't we cross?

02:23.852 --> 02:26.021
-I mean...
-What?

02:26.104 --> 02:27.523
Look, this whole thing is insane.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.858
I'm still trying to wrap my head
around all of it.

02:29.942 --> 02:33.904
But apparently, according to
the leprechaun, this isn't true love.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.532
So, you don't really love me?

02:36.615 --> 02:38.283
I didn't say that. Of course I love you.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.910
Then what are you saying?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.203
I'm not saying anything,

02:41.286 --> 02:43.830
but apparently
some cosmic verdict has been reached,

02:43.914 --> 02:45.541
and we failed. That's all.

02:45.624 --> 02:49.503
So you're ready to give up on us
because of what a leprechaun said?

02:49.586 --> 02:52.881
No, stop. I am just trying to figure out
how to get out of here

02:52.965 --> 02:54.216
and get back to reality.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.509
But not together.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.427
We already tried together.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.556
So, what?
Wait, you wanna try with other people?

03:02.474 --> 03:04.476
Oh, no. No, no. Please, no song.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.061
I'll do anything.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.605
Yeah, guys, we're actually
in the middle of som--

03:10.440 --> 03:14.987
You can't plow a field
Without hitting some stones

03:15.070 --> 03:20.117
Every steak's bound to have some fat

03:20.200 --> 03:22.411
-You can't eat a fish
-Fish

03:22.494 --> 03:25.080
-Without getting some bones
-Bones

03:25.163 --> 03:27.416
-And ya can't have love
-Can't have love

03:27.499 --> 03:32.671
-Without having a lovers' spat
-Lovers' spat

03:32.754 --> 03:34.506
Would you leave us alone
for just a minute?

03:34.590 --> 03:35.757
Seriously, please?

03:35.841 --> 03:38.886
First she says something
Bound to get his gander

03:39.469 --> 03:42.097
Then he says something mean
To get her back

03:43.182 --> 03:46.268
Then she complains
That he don't understand her

03:47.144 --> 03:49.438
And then he gives her a smack

03:50.189 --> 03:52.733
No! Oh, no, that's not okay.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.526
Unless it's consensual.

03:55.402 --> 04:01.700
It's just a love, love, lovers' spat

04:02.826 --> 04:04.328
Just 'cause you're feudin'

04:04.411 --> 04:06.079
Don't mean that you're concludin'

04:06.163 --> 04:10.000
It's as plain, plain, plain as that

04:10.083 --> 04:12.961
It's only a lovers' spat

04:13.545 --> 04:14.546
First he says:

04:15.130 --> 04:16.507
Yeah, I'm not doing this.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.716
Then she says:

04:17.798 --> 04:19.885
What a surprise.
You don't want to talk about it.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.094
Then he says:

04:21.762 --> 04:23.055
What is that supposed to mean?

04:23.138 --> 04:24.139
Then she says:

04:24.223 --> 04:26.391
It's not supposed to mean anything.
I said what I meant.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.726
Then he says:

04:27.809 --> 04:29.061
I can't do this
with all these people around.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.312
Then she says:

04:30.395 --> 04:32.189
You can't do this, period.

04:32.898 --> 04:36.818
Every gal and feller
Are bound to have a yeller

04:36.902 --> 04:38.654
-We have to get out of here.
-Yeah, yeah.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.411
Eve and Adam frolicked in the garden

04:47.037 --> 04:49.540
Living there was such a sweet delight

04:49.623 --> 04:50.749
Come on!

04:50.832 --> 04:54.253
Till Adam, he said
"Madam, beg your pardon

04:54.336 --> 04:57.130
But my apple's missing a bite"

04:57.714 --> 05:01.093
They had a

05:01.176 --> 05:04.847
Love, love, lovers' spat

05:04.930 --> 05:06.598
Just 'cause you're wranglin'

05:06.682 --> 05:08.392
Don't mean that you're untanglin'

05:08.475 --> 05:12.229
It's as plain, plain, plain as that

05:12.312 --> 05:14.982
It's only a lovers' spat

05:15.858 --> 05:16.859
First she says:

05:16.942 --> 05:18.694
So what's the plan, Josh?
Look for someone new?

05:18.777 --> 05:19.778
Then he says:

05:19.862 --> 05:21.947
I'm not having a discussion
that's part of a musical number.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.282
Then she says:

05:23.365 --> 05:25.075
Why won't you just answer the question?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.159
Then he says:

05:26.243 --> 05:28.287
Fine. Yes.
If it's a way to get out of here.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.454
Then she says:

05:29.538 --> 05:31.331
I knew it. I knew it!

05:31.415 --> 05:32.541
Then he says:

05:37.546 --> 05:39.756
It's like if The Walking Dead
was also Glee.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.717
-You watched Glee?
-I was aware of it.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.803
It's just a

05:44.887 --> 05:46.889
Love, love, lovers' spat

05:46.972 --> 05:48.223
Holy shit.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.766
Just 'cause you bicker

05:49.850 --> 05:51.518
Don't mean that you'll end quicker

05:51.602 --> 05:54.396
It's as plain, plain, plain as that

05:55.147 --> 05:57.608
It's only a lovers' spat

05:58.483 --> 06:01.945
When he puts her on the spot
And she spits out of spite

06:02.029 --> 06:05.532
They're a kettle and a pot
Both convinced they're right

06:05.616 --> 06:08.285
And they think it's all for naught
Then they kiss

06:08.368 --> 06:11.914
Good night

06:14.166 --> 06:15.959
Do you think this is true love?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.044
What?

06:17.711 --> 06:21.298
Do you think this,
you and me, is true love?

06:23.425 --> 06:24.510
You don't?

06:25.344 --> 06:27.429
You don't. Okay. Good to know.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.306
What does that even mean, true love?

06:29.389 --> 06:32.100
It's like you've got this perfect idea
of what love is supposed to be.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.393
Maybe that doesn't even exist.

06:33.477 --> 06:36.188
Just because something is hard
doesn't mean it's unattainable.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.233
It takes work.
But clearly you're not willing to do that.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.152
You know what? I'm done. It's over.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.237
-Mel.
-No, I mean it!

06:43.320 --> 06:44.863
We're officially broken up now.

06:44.947 --> 06:48.700
You're free to find true love
with whoever you want. 'Cause this is it.

06:48.784 --> 06:51.203
The end. And you suck.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.622
And I hate you. And I hope you die.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.541
-Mel.
-Stop saying "Mel."

06:55.624 --> 06:57.251
You sound like a freaking idiot.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.963
That's how you end a lovers'

07:01.046 --> 07:02.840
How you end a lovers'

07:02.923 --> 07:06.009
Spat

07:34.079 --> 07:35.622
Miss Melissa.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.125
Mr. Mayor. I'm sorry, I was just--

07:38.208 --> 07:41.003
Are you okay? Have you been crying?

07:44.631 --> 07:46.550
Come here. What's wrong?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.886
Nothing you need to worry about.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.723
I am the mayor. I worry about everything
that happens in Schmigadoon.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.434
Now, what's the trouble?

07:55.517 --> 07:57.311
Josh and I broke up.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.439
Oh, no.
You sure it wasn't just a lovers' spat?

08:00.522 --> 08:02.524
Yes, it wasn't a lovers' spat.

08:04.193 --> 08:07.154
It's over. It's actually over.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.781
Oh, Melissa, I am so sorry.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.201
I really thought he was the one.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.703
But I guess I don't know.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.833
I know it hurts right now,
but that won't last forever.

08:20.667 --> 08:25.839
Soon you'll forget all about Josh
and find somebody new. Somebody better.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.299
It's not that easy.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.384
I didn't say it would be easy.

08:29.927 --> 08:32.929
But it will happen. I'm certain of it.

08:35.849 --> 08:41.313
Somewhere love is waiting for you

08:42.523 --> 08:48.487
Someday it will come right on cue

08:49.238 --> 08:55.827
Just as every morning
The sun comes into view

08:55.911 --> 09:01.792
Somewhere love is waiting for you

09:04.711 --> 09:05.963
Oh, am I supposed to si--

09:06.046 --> 09:08.841
And when you find him

09:08.924 --> 09:12.135
Bells won't be ringing

09:12.219 --> 09:15.389
No angels singing

09:15.472 --> 09:18.141
To lead you to him

09:18.809 --> 09:21.812
For when you find him

09:21.895 --> 09:25.190
A little voice

09:25.274 --> 09:28.819
Leaves you no choice

09:28.902 --> 09:33.031
But to pursue him

09:34.658 --> 09:39.246
Then he'll smile at you
Place your hand in his

09:39.329 --> 09:43.667
And at once you'll know
What contentment is

09:43.750 --> 09:47.880
Then he'll hold you close
In his strong, tanned arms

09:47.963 --> 09:53.302
And your heart's a fire
Setting off alarms

09:53.385 --> 09:56.555
At last the love that was forbidden

09:56.638 --> 10:02.352
No longer must be hidden

10:07.399 --> 10:11.945
Somewhere love is waiting for

10:12.863 --> 10:19.828
You

10:24.499 --> 10:27.920
Mr. Mayor, are you-- are you gay?

10:29.213 --> 10:30.214
I try to be.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.508
Schmigadoon's motto is,

10:32.591 --> 10:35.302
"We always strive
for peace and happiness."

10:35.385 --> 10:39.556
So I try to be an example of joy
and gaiety for the folks in town.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.311
But sometimes it's not so easy.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.147
Life can be so hard.

10:49.024 --> 10:53.904
I guess this is the place I come to
when I want to be gay...

10:57.199 --> 10:58.408
but I can't.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.663
Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry, I--

11:02.746 --> 11:04.957
Look at me going on and on

11:05.040 --> 11:07.584
when I'm the one who's
supposed to be comforting you.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.711
You have. I do feel better.

11:09.795 --> 11:11.922
Good. Because you know what?

11:13.090 --> 11:17.010
Everyone in Schmigadoon
deserves to find true love.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.514
Yeah. They do.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.897
Here's to finding true love.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.571
Oh, a reprise.

11:37.447 --> 11:41.410
Somewhere love is waiting for

11:41.493 --> 11:45.539
You

11:48.417 --> 11:49.418
Ow!

11:49.918 --> 11:51.044
Sorry, Pete.

11:51.128 --> 11:55.883
You

12:00.262 --> 12:02.472
Well, hey there, Mr. Skinner.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.892
Hey, Betsy is it?

12:04.975 --> 12:07.102
Oh, you remembered.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.062
And these are my sisters, Laurey, Carrie,

12:09.146 --> 12:11.481
Nellie, Fiona, Cindy,
and that is little Tootie.

12:11.565 --> 12:15.360
Is this the fella who said the joke
about sleeping like a log?

12:15.444 --> 12:16.737
That is him.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.947
Oh, say it again. Please.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.574
What, that I slept like a log?

12:21.950 --> 12:24.244
I told you he was funny.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.997
I'm so sorry to hear about you
splitting up with Miss Melissa.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.999
Though I do suppose that means

12:29.082 --> 12:31.251
you'll be looking for a basket
to bid on tonight.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.253
Oh, no. No, I--

12:33.337 --> 12:35.339
I mean-- What--

12:35.422 --> 12:36.423
What basket?

12:36.507 --> 12:38.592
Well, tonight's
the annual picnic basket auction

12:38.675 --> 12:40.427
to raise money
to buy books for the library.

12:40.511 --> 12:43.263
And replace the ones
the reverend's wife burned.

12:43.847 --> 12:47.559
Every gal in town makes up a picnic basket
to auction off to the men in town,

12:47.643 --> 12:51.230
and the highest bid gets the basket
plus dinner with the gal who made it.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.941
And maybe a little something special
for dessert.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.318
Though it is a secret
whose basket's whose,

12:56.401 --> 12:58.570
so even if someone wanted to,

12:58.654 --> 13:01.365
he would have no way of knowing
which basket was mine.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.243
So what do you say, Mr. Skinner?
Are you coming tonight?

13:04.952 --> 13:07.496
-Oh, yes. Please come. You have to.
-Oh, yes. Please come.

13:07.579 --> 13:10.541
Okay. Okay. All right, I'll come.
I'll come. All right?

13:10.624 --> 13:12.167
For the library. All right?

13:12.251 --> 13:14.670
And actually, it's Dr. Skinner.

13:16.004 --> 13:19.132
Dr. Skinner? Oh, my.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.718
All right, get outta here, y'all.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.929
These chairs ain't gonna
set up themselves.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.806
-Bye, Dr. Skinner.
-Bye.

13:26.390 --> 13:27.641
Nice to meet you.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.811
My basket will be waiting for you tonight.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.147
It'll be wrapped
in a pink, velvety ribbon,

13:34.231 --> 13:36.567
and it will smell like peaches
and sweet cream.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.111
I'll see you tonight.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.283
Okay.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.790
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.836
What are you, selling popcorn now?

13:55.919 --> 13:59.173
I just thought maybe I'd stop by
this basket auction thing.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.426
You're going to the basket auction?

14:03.093 --> 14:07.639
We broke up, like, two hours ago,
and now you're going to the basket auction

14:07.723 --> 14:10.851
where men are bidding
on women like livestock.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.312
Well, it's for the library.

14:13.395 --> 14:16.231
Let me guess. You're bidding
on the Rhodes scholar waitress

14:16.315 --> 14:18.734
who thought "slept like a log"
was hilarious.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.986
I just think--
I think it's the way I said it.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.779
You are so predictable. Whatever.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.157
Go have fun with your teenage cliché.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.366
She's not a teenager.

14:26.450 --> 14:29.036
And I'm just trying to get out of here.
Aren't you?

14:29.119 --> 14:32.456
Yeah, I'm trying as hard as I can.

14:32.539 --> 14:36.418
If only I'd known the secret
was just laughing at everything you say.

14:36.502 --> 14:37.794
Mel, be fair.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.133
You know, you're stuck here too.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.844
I'm not suggesting this
for the actual world,

14:45.928 --> 14:48.931
but since we're both stuck in this world,

14:49.014 --> 14:50.682
maybe you should make your own basket.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.769
Oh, really? So I can be bought
by some man with four teeth.

14:53.852 --> 14:54.853
No, thank you.

14:55.646 --> 14:58.190
Okay. I hope you like it here.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.608
Now if you'll excuse me...

15:00.776 --> 15:02.152
I got a basket to win.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.156
Hey, cool hat.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.741
You wish you had this hat.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.076
Good one.

15:11.203 --> 15:13.664
It's the picnic basket auction.

15:25.551 --> 15:26.802
See, 'cause they--

15:32.599 --> 15:34.893
Whoa, you're not
gonna wanna drink that, missy.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.979
That there's the gentlemen's punch bowl.

15:37.646 --> 15:38.814
It's got alcohol in it.

15:40.566 --> 15:43.235
Thank you for the warning,
Larry the Fireman.

15:45.153 --> 15:49.199
It's time. It's time.
It's time for the auction.

15:49.283 --> 15:50.409
Who is that kid?

15:51.118 --> 15:53.328
What, is his job to announce everything?

15:53.412 --> 15:55.914
That's Carson, Miss Tate
the schoolmarm's little brother.

15:55.998 --> 15:59.293
Their parents are dead,
so she's had to raise him herself.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.711
Poor kid's got no friends.

16:00.794 --> 16:04.256
You know, on account of his tongue
being too big for his mouth.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.633
All right, gentlemen,

16:06.717 --> 16:10.179
time to loosen up those pockets
and raise some money for the library.

16:10.262 --> 16:13.182
And replace all the books
that were recently destroyed.

16:13.265 --> 16:15.100
-Because they were filthy.
-Filthy?

16:15.184 --> 16:17.269
No, these were great works of literature.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.897
Chaucer, Voltaire, Balzac.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.983
-Won't take a husband.
-All right. All right, enough prattling.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.651
Now you all know the rules.

16:24.735 --> 16:28.030
You're not supposed to know
which basket goes with which gal.

16:28.113 --> 16:31.033
But, of course, if your sweetheart's
told you what her basket looks like,

16:31.116 --> 16:32.284
that ain't my business.

16:35.412 --> 16:40.167
So, is that gooseberry pie I smell?

16:40.250 --> 16:41.752
What am I offered for this beauty?

16:41.835 --> 16:44.338
Two bits from Preston. Three bits!

16:44.421 --> 16:46.006
Four in the back from Barnaby.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.509
Five bits. Thank you, five.
Six bits. Six bits.

16:48.592 --> 16:51.178
Going once. Going twice.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.472
Sold to Jeremiah in the front row.

16:53.555 --> 16:56.225
-How much is a bit?
-Twelve and 1/2 cents.

16:56.308 --> 16:59.603
Why's there a term for 12 and 1/2 cents?
How's that helpful?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.855
What do I hear for that one?
Two bits. Thank you, sir.

17:01.939 --> 17:05.983
Three bits. Four bits.
Five bits. Six bits. Seven bits.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.904
Sold to the gentleman
in the cap over there.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.073
Sold to Uncle Otis in the third row.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.200
Sold to Enoch from The Schmigazette.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.243
Sold to Curly for five bits.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.329
Sold to Marcellus for three bits.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.332
All right, there's only one basket left.

17:20.415 --> 17:24.837
And something tells me
this one's gonna be mighty popular.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.839
What do I hear for this fine basket?

17:27.923 --> 17:29.633
-Two bits!
-Four bits!

17:29.716 --> 17:31.426
-Four bits, thank you, sir.
-Dang it.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.554
-Six bits!
-Two dollars!

17:33.637 --> 17:34.763
Two dollars?

17:35.806 --> 17:38.308
Nobody's ever bid two dollars before.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.520
Okay, two dollars. Going once...

17:41.603 --> 17:43.105
Two dollars and two bits.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.316
I can't compete with that.

17:46.400 --> 17:51.572
Well, it looks like this basket is going
to Henry for two dollars and two bits.

17:51.655 --> 17:54.491
Going once. Going twice.

17:54.575 --> 17:56.410
Hold on there, Mr. Mayor.

17:59.413 --> 18:00.747
Twenty dollars.

18:01.957 --> 18:06.128
Sold to the newcomer, Mr. Skinner,
there, for $20.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.422
That's Dr. Skinner.

18:10.007 --> 18:12.176
Hey, I'm a doctor too, by the way.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.178
But you're a lady.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.888
I think we can all agree

18:15.971 --> 18:19.892
this was the most successful
picnic basket auction we've ever had.

18:19.975 --> 18:20.976
Thanks to our bidders--

18:21.059 --> 18:22.227
All right, hold on.

18:22.311 --> 18:25.439
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Pardon me. Pardon me.

18:25.522 --> 18:28.025
The auction is not over yet.

18:29.443 --> 18:32.988
Well, Miss Melissa,
you've decided to make a basket?

18:33.071 --> 18:36.283
No, no. I am the basket, baby.

18:38.619 --> 18:42.247
I don't think you quite understand
how the picnic basket auction works.

18:42.331 --> 18:44.917
Oh, no, I understand how it works, okay?

18:45.000 --> 18:49.421
'Cause these horny sickos are bidding
on women like pieces of meat.

18:49.505 --> 18:50.506
Okay.

18:50.589 --> 18:51.965
-Well, guess what.
-All right.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.510
This piece of meat has a brain.

18:54.593 --> 18:57.888
And it is filled with thoughts and ideas.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.349
So let's get this party started.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.601
Who wants to buy this meat basket?

19:03.685 --> 19:05.896
Mel, please. Get down from there.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.857
You get down from there.
Shut up. You're just jealous.

19:08.941 --> 19:13.445
Oh, and by the way,
where we come from, $20 is like nothing.

19:13.529 --> 19:17.699
It's like a medium pizza, okay?
So don't be all impressed.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.371
Okay. So...

19:23.330 --> 19:25.791
let's start the bidding at two bits.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.125
Do I hear two bits?

19:29.670 --> 19:30.921
Two bits to start.

19:32.047 --> 19:36.260
How about one bit?
One bit for the lovely Miss Melissa.

19:39.638 --> 19:41.098
Do I hear five cents?

19:42.349 --> 19:43.642
We have five cents.

19:43.725 --> 19:47.396
Actually, I just have a question.
I'm confused. Is there pie?

19:48.438 --> 19:50.732
No, but you get something better.

19:50.816 --> 19:52.651
-Cake?
-No.

19:52.734 --> 19:59.449
A strong, independent woman who will
never accept less than she deserves again.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.201
Now who wants to buy me?

20:01.994 --> 20:04.580
-Yes, Henry for five cents.
-No, I got a question too.

20:04.663 --> 20:07.666
Would you be willing to bake a pie?
Say, at a future date?

20:07.749 --> 20:13.380
No! There's no pies
or no preserves, okay? It's just me.

20:14.173 --> 20:15.382
But come on.

20:15.465 --> 20:18.051
I'm attractive. I'm well educated.

20:18.135 --> 20:22.055
I make good money.
I volunteer, or intend to.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.932
Plus I'm fun. You shut up!

20:24.016 --> 20:25.726
-You know I'm fun.
-What did--

20:25.809 --> 20:28.061
So come on. Let's bid already.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.315
Come on, fellas.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.025
It's for the library.

20:35.736 --> 20:36.778
Two dollars.

20:40.532 --> 20:41.700
All I got in the world.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.244
I have a bid from Danny Bailey
for two dollars.

20:44.328 --> 20:45.829
Going once. Going twice. Sold!

20:47.039 --> 20:48.749
Did you see that?

20:48.832 --> 20:52.419
This super-hot guy just
bought me for two dollars. Yeah.

20:52.503 --> 20:55.380
Make it rain, Danny Bailey.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.508
Well, that was fun.

20:57.591 --> 21:00.719
Obviously those signs
at the punch bowls don't work.

21:00.802 --> 21:02.179
Good night, everybody.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.851
You kept me
in suspense there a little bit.

21:07.935 --> 21:08.936
Yeah.

21:10.437 --> 21:14.191
I don't like those two outsiders, Howard,
or their newfangled city ideas.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.526
They don't belong here.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.444
I don't know about that, Mildred.

21:17.528 --> 21:19.571
I know you don't,
that's why I'm telling you.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.157
They need to go.

21:24.952 --> 21:28.580
-So, Danny Bailey.
-Guilty as charged.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.082
Until proven innocent.

21:30.165 --> 21:32.376
Or not guilty due
to plausible deniability.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.128
Prosecution didn't do their job. Mistrial.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.172
This is fun.

21:37.256 --> 21:39.174
Are you having fun? We're having fun.

21:39.258 --> 21:41.760
So much more fun than Josh
and that stupid waitress.

21:41.844 --> 21:43.887
-Don't you think?
-I reckon so.

21:43.971 --> 21:46.598
Say, what do you think of that teddy bear?

21:46.682 --> 21:48.100
It's creepy.

21:48.183 --> 21:49.601
-You want it?
-Yes.

21:49.685 --> 21:51.562
-Are you gonna win it for me?
-Heck no.

21:51.645 --> 21:55.107
You're a strong, independent woman.
You're gonna win it for yourself.

22:01.697 --> 22:03.657
Wait. Is this an actual gun?

22:03.740 --> 22:05.117
It sure is.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.579
Now, you're gonna want
to place your left hand on the barrel

22:08.662 --> 22:10.747
while you position your finger
on the trigger.

22:10.831 --> 22:12.124
Now, be careful.

22:12.207 --> 22:16.044
This thing can go off if you stroke it
the right way, even gently.

22:16.128 --> 22:19.381
So mind your grip and just remember

22:19.464 --> 22:22.801
these things were built to explode.

22:23.594 --> 22:25.137
-Danny.
-Yes, Melissa.

22:25.971 --> 22:28.098
This might be a bit complicated

22:28.182 --> 22:31.935
because I am a bit tipsy
in the spectrum of consent,

22:32.019 --> 22:36.982
but all I'm thinking right now
is how good your neck smells

22:37.065 --> 22:41.278
and how I would throw my mother
in front of a bus

22:41.361 --> 22:44.156
to get the chance to ride you.

22:45.449 --> 22:48.577
You're a funny kid. What's a bus?

22:50.078 --> 22:52.539
And the lady wins a prize.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.127
It's all yours, Melissa.

22:57.211 --> 22:59.963
I mean, even, like,

23:00.047 --> 23:04.176
how you use my name in a sentence,
it's limb-wobbling.

23:04.259 --> 23:06.637
I'm not used to this, okay?

23:06.720 --> 23:09.681
I'm generally pretty level-headed
and rational.

23:09.765 --> 23:11.016
Well, yee honk.

23:11.642 --> 23:13.519
-Yee honk?
-That's right.

23:13.602 --> 23:16.772
I like women who can think for themselves.
But sometimes...

23:18.106 --> 23:19.525
you got to do less thinking.

23:25.697 --> 23:26.865
How do you feel now?

23:28.158 --> 23:30.035
Holy shit. Am I about to get a song?

23:30.661 --> 23:33.330
My own song? I am!

23:38.335 --> 23:42.673
When it comes to love and romance

23:42.756 --> 23:47.052
I've never left a thing to chance

23:47.135 --> 23:51.849
Stiffer than a froggy in formaldehyde

23:51.932 --> 23:56.186
Now it's time to enjoy the ride

23:57.145 --> 23:58.981
Oh, it's in my range and everything.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.986
What about plans you've made?

24:04.069 --> 24:05.863
Plans are for sissies

24:05.946 --> 24:08.615
I've heard you've never strayed

24:08.699 --> 24:10.409
Just give me some kissies

24:10.492 --> 24:14.913
Always used to let
My conscience be my guide

24:14.997 --> 24:19.293
Now it's time to enjoy the ride

24:24.506 --> 24:28.760
Effortless, effortless

24:28.844 --> 24:33.640
This is so effing effortless

24:33.724 --> 24:38.145
Ready to taste the things
I've never tasted

24:38.228 --> 24:42.816
Wow!
Your pants are really high-waisted

24:42.900 --> 24:45.527
What about being good?

24:45.611 --> 24:47.446
I wanna be bad now

24:47.529 --> 24:50.199
Doing the things you should?

24:50.282 --> 24:51.992
What are you, my dad now?

24:52.075 --> 24:56.413
Bring on all the fun
That I have been denied

24:56.496 --> 25:00.709
Now it's time to enjoy the ride

25:14.014 --> 25:15.015
Oink, oink

25:45.921 --> 25:47.047
Yeah.

25:52.553 --> 25:55.180
This is some little hike.

25:55.764 --> 25:58.183
Well, I thought it'd be good to get away.

25:58.267 --> 26:00.602
Especially from
that heartless Miss Melissa.

26:00.686 --> 26:03.063
Let's not talk about Miss Melissa.

26:03.814 --> 26:05.566
You poor thing.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.609
I mean, you must really be hurting.

26:08.235 --> 26:12.239
But don't you worry.
Betsy is gonna make it all better.

26:13.407 --> 26:14.616
Would you like that?

26:15.534 --> 26:17.536
Yes. Yes, I would.

26:21.081 --> 26:23.834
I just love this place.

26:24.418 --> 26:27.462
The high school kids call it
"Virginity Ruins."

26:27.546 --> 26:30.674
It's where they all come to,
you know, "picnic."

26:31.800 --> 26:35.053
Not that I've been here before. Tee-hee.

26:37.514 --> 26:39.725
Well, if you had been here before,

26:39.808 --> 26:41.727
it would've been a long time ago

26:41.810 --> 26:44.104
because it was way back
when you were in high school.

26:44.188 --> 26:45.272
Am I right?

26:45.355 --> 26:47.691
Oh, look!
There's the swing I used to swing on

26:47.774 --> 26:49.943
the summer that I turned 14.

26:50.861 --> 26:52.821
It seems like that was only yesterday.

26:52.905 --> 26:54.364
But it wasn't, right?

26:54.448 --> 26:56.116
Oh, and over yonder,

26:56.200 --> 26:59.661
there's the special tree that
my papa planted the day that I was born.

27:00.579 --> 27:02.206
Oh, no.

27:02.289 --> 27:04.249
You are really young.

27:04.333 --> 27:08.629
Look, Betsy, I feel like it's a good time
to set some ground rules

27:08.712 --> 27:11.798
in terms of what's gonna happen
between us tonight.

27:12.883 --> 27:14.468
Why, Dr. Skinner,

27:14.551 --> 27:17.888
what makes you think anything's
gonna happen between us?

27:17.971 --> 27:20.516
You know, I think you have
the wrong idea about me.

27:21.225 --> 27:25.354
Other girls flirt and talk romance

27:25.437 --> 27:29.525
Soon as they see a pair of pants

27:29.608 --> 27:34.696
When the sun goes down
They let their morals slide

27:34.780 --> 27:38.825
But I'm gonna wait till I'm a bride

27:40.202 --> 27:42.829
That's great to hear, Betsy,
'cause here's the thing.

27:42.913 --> 27:44.540
You are way too youn--

27:44.623 --> 27:48.126
Other girls like to show their skin

27:48.210 --> 27:52.631
Gettin' a boy's mind set on sin

27:53.340 --> 27:57.845
Willing to do things
That I have never tried

27:57.928 --> 28:02.266
Cause I'm gonna wait till I'm a bride

28:06.186 --> 28:08.814
Okay, I'm kinda getting some
mixed messages here.

28:11.024 --> 28:14.862
Baby, you're much too much

28:14.945 --> 28:17.364
I'm losing my senses

28:17.447 --> 28:21.577
Hoping you still got touch

28:21.660 --> 28:23.912
There go my defenses

28:23.996 --> 28:30.294
Baby, don't you wanna
Find out what's inside?

28:30.377 --> 28:31.545
Yes.

28:31.628 --> 28:36.133
Now it's time to enjoy

28:36.216 --> 28:43.182
The ride

28:47.519 --> 28:49.354
But then again, why wait?

28:52.608 --> 28:53.817
Papa!

28:54.443 --> 28:56.445
You better start proposing, son.

29:01.617 --> 29:04.661
First she says something
Bound to get his gander

29:05.495 --> 29:08.081
Then he says something mean
To get her back

29:09.291 --> 29:12.169
Then she complains
That he don't understand her

29:13.086 --> 29:15.714
And then he gives her a smack

29:20.844 --> 29:27.476
It's just a love, love, lovers' spat

29:28.018 --> 29:29.520
Just 'cause you're feudin'

29:29.603 --> 29:31.271
Don't mean that you're concludin'

29:31.355 --> 29:35.192
It's as plain, plain, plain as that

29:35.275 --> 29:38.153
It's only a lovers' spat

29:38.862 --> 29:40.113
First he says:

29:42.032 --> 29:43.158
Then she says:

29:45.452 --> 29:49.373
Every gal and feller
Are bound to have a yeller

29:55.921 --> 29:59.591
Eve and Adam frolicked in the garden

29:59.675 --> 30:02.511
Living there was such a sweet delight

30:03.303 --> 30:06.723
Till Adam, he said
"Madam, beg your pardon

30:06.807 --> 30:10.102
But my apple's missing a bite"

30:10.185 --> 30:13.564
They had a

30:13.647 --> 30:17.317
Love, love, lovers' spat

30:17.401 --> 30:19.069
Just 'cause you're wranglin'

30:19.152 --> 30:20.863
Don't mean that you're untanglin'

30:20.946 --> 30:22.656
It's as plain, plain, plain...
