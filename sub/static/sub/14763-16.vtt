00:05.371 --> 00:06.606
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
What's our status,
Black Widow?

00:06.608 --> 00:08.707
Is it as bad as it looks?

00:08.709 --> 00:10.976
BLACK WIDOW: It's worse.
Flight control systems
just went down

00:10.978 --> 00:13.045
and took engines one
and two with it.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.347
Falcon, can you recalibrate
the stabilizer?

00:15.349 --> 00:18.384
Won't do any good.
The stabilizer's on fire too.

00:20.387 --> 00:21.954
(BEEPING)

00:25.025 --> 00:26.725
This is Captain America!
Mayday!

00:26.727 --> 00:28.193
Flight controls
non-responsive.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.029
All air traffic
clear the area!

00:30.031 --> 00:31.397
(ALARM BEEPING)
Hang on!

00:36.569 --> 00:39.371
Some kind of tractor beam,
it's slowing our descent.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.776
FALCON: That was a close call.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.414
Great save, whoever that is.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.753
They're coming in
for a landing.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.422
Yeah, a crash landing.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.023
Thor!

00:58.025 --> 01:01.093
Right with you, Hulk!

01:01.095 --> 01:03.162
HULK: Thanks for the assist!
I got it from here.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.065
(GRUNTING)

01:11.071 --> 01:13.172
Should've known
Hulk would have our back.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.941
Even with his front.

01:15.943 --> 01:18.243
Thor had your back
as well.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.445
Good timing.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.280
I put a call in
last week.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.681
The help's arrived.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.583
Wait, Tony,
you don't mean...
(SCOFFS)

01:24.585 --> 01:26.852
Come on, the last time
your help fixed
the Avenjet,

01:26.854 --> 01:29.254
I couldn't get it
to go slower
than Mach 2!

01:29.256 --> 01:31.790
You just hate that you
got beat at arm wrestling.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.259
Captain America
fought valiantly

01:34.261 --> 01:36.728
until his arm was slammed
through the table

01:36.730 --> 01:39.231
by Captain Marvel!
Hey, guys.

01:39.233 --> 01:43.969
Good to see you all happy,
healthy, and not-exploded.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.904
How you doing there, Army?

01:45.906 --> 01:48.040
Lose your lunch a little?
(SNICKERS)

01:48.042 --> 01:51.210
I'm doing just fine,
Air Force.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.812
Tony's told us
all about you,
Captain Marvel.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.414
Falcon, I've heard of you.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.716
Now, how did you guys
mess up the Avenjet?

01:57.718 --> 01:59.318
I don't know.
I think something

01:59.320 --> 02:01.820
must have fed the computer
faulty airspeed data.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.088
(TWEAKING)
I have a theory,

02:03.090 --> 02:04.089
but it could
take days for...

02:04.091 --> 02:05.791
Done.

02:07.093 --> 02:09.294
I'd love to stick around
and tell old war stories,

02:09.295 --> 02:12.131
especially about Helsinki,
right, Hawkeye?

02:12.133 --> 02:14.099
(CHUCKLES)

02:14.101 --> 02:17.636
But I've got
serious business.
(GASPS)

02:17.638 --> 02:21.140
TONY: That serious business
wouldn't happen to be
the Kree, would it?

02:21.142 --> 02:22.574
The Kree.
Aren't they...

02:22.576 --> 02:24.910
Aliens.
Scientifically advanced,

02:24.912 --> 02:26.478
very, very unfriendly.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.181
Especially after I kicked
their butt a few times.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.782
Those are their drones.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.752
Guess they're not here
for peace negotiations.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.834
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Avengers, defense plan tango!
(GRUNTS)

02:49.502 --> 02:51.336
Friday, suit me up.

02:55.975 --> 02:58.110
(GRUNTING)

03:02.148 --> 03:05.017
Puny Kree.
What do they want?

03:06.319 --> 03:08.020
From the looks of it, her.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.223
Follow the leader, drones.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.694
Works every time.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.629
So, Captain Marvel,

03:17.631 --> 03:20.899
is there anyone
in the universe
you haven't ticked off?

03:20.901 --> 03:23.368
This is the Kree.
They're born ticked off.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.571
But also, probably no.
(GRUNTS)

03:28.508 --> 03:30.108
You guys are too easy.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.213
(GRUNTING)

03:35.481 --> 03:38.584
Okay, maybe not that easy.
I got you.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.520
(POWERING DOWN)

03:41.522 --> 03:44.256
Ha! I let you have
that one!
(GRUNTS)

03:46.359 --> 03:48.427
And that one I took!

03:48.429 --> 03:50.495
IRON MAN: Falcon, trace
their ionic signature.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.564
Widow, Thor...
Whoa.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.001
I appreciate the help,
but this is my mission,
and it's solo.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.170
A team will just
slow me down.

03:58.172 --> 04:01.373
You doubt our speed?

04:01.375 --> 04:03.675
(SIGHS) So glad
you called in help, Tony.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.444
Falcon, Thor, with me.

04:05.446 --> 04:09.248
Everyone else,
stay on guard against
any further Kree attacks.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.749
What happened in Helsinki?

04:10.751 --> 04:14.319
I do not want
to talk about it.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.892
I knew you couldn't
help yourself, Army.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.394
The Kree are a serious threat.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.763
It's exactly what
the Avengers are for.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.299
Aw, that's cute.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.703
Falcon, fire up
your tracker.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.206
See if we can pinpoint
their location.

04:39.412 --> 04:42.314
I heard the Kree captured you
and altered your DNA.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.449
They gave you your powers?

04:44.451 --> 04:46.318
Yeah, that happened.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.420
And how does that feel?

04:48.422 --> 04:51.156
Let's see... I can fly,
I'm indestructible,

04:51.158 --> 04:53.492
and I shoot energy beams out
of my hands.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.627
Feels pretty awesome.
(BEEPING)

04:55.629 --> 04:57.262
Something coming from inside.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.563
THOR: Then let us open it up

04:58.565 --> 05:00.399
and get to the heart
of the matter!

05:00.401 --> 05:03.502
We'd better split up
and recon
the perimeter before...

05:04.570 --> 05:07.306
Perimeter's breached.
Let's go, boys!

05:10.510 --> 05:12.077
(GROANS)

05:29.095 --> 05:30.228
(ROARS)

05:31.998 --> 05:33.832
(GRUNTS)

05:37.503 --> 05:39.438
This feels like a trap.

05:41.307 --> 05:44.509
<i>Captain Marvel,</i>
<i>gracing us with your presence.</i>

05:44.511 --> 05:46.345
Galen-Kor.

05:46.347 --> 05:49.147
Haven't seen your
nasty-looking grill
in a while.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.616
<i>I've been recharging,</i>
<i>planning,</i>

05:51.618 --> 05:55.320

05:55.322 --> 05:58.657
<i>You and I have</i>
<i>unfinished business.</i>

05:58.659 --> 06:03.328
<i>Your friends may have</i>
<i>protected you earlier</i>
<i>from my attack drones,</i>

06:03.330 --> 06:05.197

06:05.199 --> 06:09.000
<i>aboard a vessel</i>
<i>of the mighty Kree Empire.</i>

06:09.002 --> 06:11.002
(CHUCKLES)
Is that an invitation?

06:11.004 --> 06:13.638
Because I'm afraid
I have to decline.

06:13.640 --> 06:17.342
<i>Oh, but you've</i>
<i>already accepted.</i>

06:17.344 --> 06:19.344
(RUMBLING)
(GASPS)

06:19.346 --> 06:21.480
The warehouse is the ship.
Get out now!

06:21.482 --> 06:25.784
<i>I look forward to seeing you.</i>
<i>Very soon.</i>

06:39.732 --> 06:41.500
Look for an escape hatch!

06:41.502 --> 06:44.336
CAPTAIN MARVEL:
Too late, we're docking!

06:44.338 --> 06:45.470
(BOTH GRUNT)

06:52.879 --> 06:54.579
Where are they taking us?

06:57.049 --> 06:59.518
Looks like
the Kree homeworld.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.720
Any of these diagrams show
the way to the bridge?

07:01.722 --> 07:04.456
When the only way out of this
chamber is a locked door?

07:04.458 --> 07:06.425
No diagram needed.

07:08.728 --> 07:10.796
(YELLS)

07:10.798 --> 07:12.130
Huh?

07:12.132 --> 07:13.865
They'll have to come
in here eventually.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.634
And wait for them
to come get us?

07:15.636 --> 07:16.735
We need to be
proactive here.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.270
Falcon, help me set up
an ambush.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.205
Falcon, help me override
the door controls.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.610
Thanks, Thor.
Well, let me try the door.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.245
If it doesn't work,
we set up the ambush.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.346
(KEYPAD BEEPING)

07:29.949 --> 07:32.684
(BOTH GRUNTING)

07:34.754 --> 07:36.321
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Can we get through

07:36.323 --> 07:39.090
or do we need to set up
an ambush?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.159
It worked.
Unfortunately for us,

07:41.161 --> 07:42.694
I think an ambush
is already on.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.968
CAPTAIN MARVEL:
Kree Sentries!

07:49.970 --> 07:51.803
They're automated
guard robots!

07:58.444 --> 08:00.545
(LAUGHS)

08:02.348 --> 08:04.349
FALCON: The Sentries
are self-repairing.

08:04.351 --> 08:07.652
This advanced Kree technology
is really kind of cool.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.555
CAPTAIN MARVEL: Yeah,
for something trying to
burn us to a crisp!

08:11.757 --> 08:13.758
(GRUNTS)

08:13.760 --> 08:15.861
This is probably
a multi-link router.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.930
Activated the Sentries
when we hacked the door.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.433
(GRUNTS)

08:21.435 --> 08:23.635
Cap! Your aim any better
than it was

08:23.637 --> 08:25.637
when we fought Hydra
in Barcelona?

08:25.639 --> 08:29.107
I seem to remember taking out
two Hydra snipers on your six.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.877
Two? Ha, yeah, right!

08:31.879 --> 08:35.013
Then that blinking box
on the ceiling should be
no problem.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.381
(GRUNTS)

08:40.620 --> 08:42.888
(ROBOTS POWERING DOWN)

08:42.890 --> 08:44.656
Oh, and for the record,

08:44.658 --> 08:46.391
my aim can't get any better.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.127
Did humble Captain America
just show off?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.429
(CHUCKLES)
I like it.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.569
So what happened
in Helsinki?

08:57.571 --> 09:00.739
I HALO'd in from
the stratosphere,
rescued Hawkeye,

09:00.741 --> 09:02.741
pulled a jumbo jet
out of a tailspin,

09:02.743 --> 09:05.710
teamed up with
Captain America,
re-rescued Hawkeye,

09:05.712 --> 09:07.712
and defeated a horde
of barbarians.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.916
Barbarians?
Like real barbarians?

09:13.486 --> 09:15.020
I assume
they were barbarians.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.255
From the beards.
And the smell.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.425
Though I guess that could
have been Hawkeye.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.761
Enough with the war stories.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.564
You are old compatriots
with a friendly rivalry,

09:25.566 --> 09:28.767
and yet you seem displeased
with her.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.670
Captain Marvel's
one of the finest soldiers
I've ever fought with,

09:31.672 --> 09:33.905
but there's a reason
she works alone.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.815
Cryogenic chambers.

09:46.686 --> 09:49.020
There are people inside.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.722
CAPTAIN MARVEL:
Not just people.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.223
Inhumans.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.092
You don't seem
very surprised.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.127
The new Inhumans
have been disappearing,

09:56.129 --> 09:57.529
so the National
Security Council

09:57.531 --> 09:58.730
asked me to investigate

09:58.732 --> 10:01.066
since they potentially
carry so much power.

10:01.068 --> 10:04.069
Now, we have proof the Kree
are abducting them from Earth.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.770
There are a lot of
new Inhumans.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.572
That's a threat
to the whole planet.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.608
I will free them
from their frozen prisons.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.210
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Can't open them here.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.745
I've seen this
red gas before.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.982
It keeps Inhumans sedated,
but it's poison to us.

10:16.984 --> 10:20.118
We need to get
to the ship's bridge
to shut it down.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.492
We need a plan.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.461
You got it.
Wait.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.865
Whoo! (LAUGHS)

10:38.671 --> 10:40.271
When I say
"We need a plan,"

10:40.273 --> 10:42.841
that implies that we're going
to tell the rest of the team.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.010
When you're up in the sky
at 600 miles per hour,

10:45.012 --> 10:46.277
you act on instinct.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.179
Falcon knows
what I'm talking about.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.615
Uh...
Well, when you're
in a foxhole,

10:50.617 --> 10:51.750
you learn to depend
on your teammates

10:51.752 --> 10:54.252
instead of selfishly
taking chances and risks.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.587
Right, Falcon?

10:55.589 --> 10:58.156
You know, your Army
versus Air Force rivalry

10:58.158 --> 11:00.592
doesn't matter because
we're in outer space.

11:00.594 --> 11:02.260
So what's say
we call a truce?

11:05.464 --> 11:07.499
The bridge is on
the other side of this door,

11:07.501 --> 11:08.767
so we can't break it down.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.869
Maybe you can hack
into it?

11:12.171 --> 11:14.039
(BEEPING)

11:14.940 --> 11:16.107
Hmm?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.347
How did you...

11:22.349 --> 11:25.050
I was sneaking in places
when you were flying
paper airplanes.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.485
And I found an access vent
right behind you.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.288
Old school. Nice.
Though I can't help
but notice

11:30.290 --> 11:32.223
you didn't tell
the rest of the team.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.192
(CHUCKLES)

11:35.795 --> 11:38.296
GALEN-KOR:
Transmit a message
to the homeworld.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.866
Inform them...
CAPTAIN MARVEL:
That your mission has failed.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.836
Impossible.
You escaped my Sentries?

11:44.838 --> 11:47.972
We can tell you all about it,
after you let the Inhumans go.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.842
Ah, my precious cargo.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.477
Once we weaponize
their powers,

11:52.479 --> 11:55.013
the Kree Empire
will be invincible.

11:55.015 --> 11:59.984
And as a bonus,
I'll bring home our
most prized creation...

11:59.986 --> 12:02.420
Captain Marvel.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.189
Flattery will get you nowhere

12:04.191 --> 12:06.858
except a maximum
security prison.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.929
You do not understand
your situation.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.199
My people will praise me
for bringing them
Captain Marvel,

12:14.201 --> 12:15.900
dead or alive.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.921
Give it up, Galen-Kor!

12:36.923 --> 12:38.289
(GRUNTING)

12:39.225 --> 12:41.793
(GRUNTS)

12:41.795 --> 12:43.228
Your plan failed.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.931
The Kree never fail.
We simply adapt!

12:46.933 --> 12:48.833
(GAS HISSING)

12:54.607 --> 12:56.641
Get to the fighters.

12:56.643 --> 13:00.145
We'll reclaim the ship
once they are no more.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.082
(GRUNTS)

13:04.084 --> 13:07.118
(COUGHING)
We're trapped!

13:07.120 --> 13:10.421
(COUGHING)
Only chance...

13:10.423 --> 13:12.390
The airlock.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.459
(ALARM BEEPING)

13:14.461 --> 13:16.294
(COUGHS) No!

13:16.296 --> 13:17.996
We won't survive!

13:19.131 --> 13:21.332
(GRUNTING)

13:22.768 --> 13:24.869
(GRUNTS AND YELLS)

13:38.751 --> 13:40.585
THOR: Falcon, grab hold!
(GRUNTS)

13:43.756 --> 13:45.590
(GASPING)

13:46.592 --> 13:48.560
(GRUNTS)

13:58.003 --> 13:59.838
Kree, spread out.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.240
Their end will come soon.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.854
Opening the airlock
and sucking us
all out into space?

14:15.856 --> 14:18.022
What were you thinking?
That was...

14:18.024 --> 14:19.791
A good move.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.526
Sometimes you gotta
take a chance.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.028
Thanks for the save.
No sweat.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.597
I'll add it to your tab.
(ELECTRIC HUMMING)

14:26.532 --> 14:29.334
<i>Impossible!</i>
<i>You still live?</i>

14:29.336 --> 14:32.971
Looks like it.
And now we've got your ship.
How about that?

14:32.973 --> 14:36.474
<i>I'll obliterate my own ship</i>
<i>before letting it fall</i>

14:36.476 --> 14:38.443
<i>into Earther hands!</i>

14:43.015 --> 14:44.649
Ship controls are locked.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.252
Falcon, get started on...
Done.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.988
Nice job! It's not easy
to hack the Kree system

14:49.990 --> 14:52.357
before the feedback loop
electrocutes you.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.426
Well, once I figured out...
Wait, electrocute?

14:55.428 --> 14:56.928
(SHIP THUDS)

14:58.397 --> 15:00.865
CAPTAIN MARVEL: Cap,
take the weapons systems here.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.668
(WEAPONS BLASTING)

15:07.439 --> 15:10.041
THOR: 'Tis like
the video games with Hulk.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.910
Only much, much harder!

15:11.912 --> 15:13.945
They're moving too fast.
Can't get a lock.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.247
Then let's do something
about it, Army.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.117
I'm gonna get out there
and fight them ship-to-ship.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.019
Hey, Air Force?
The only way that works

15:21.021 --> 15:23.788
is if Falcon can fly
this mothership
back to Earth.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.791
You're right.
Falcon, take the helm.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.193
You want me to pilot
the Kree mothership?

15:29.195 --> 15:31.696
And you two aren't going
to argue about this?

15:31.698 --> 15:34.232
What's to argue?
Cap trusts you.
I trust you.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.934
You got this.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.107
GALEN-KOR:
Fight hard, Kree warriors!

15:43.109 --> 15:45.076
We may lose our cargo,

15:45.078 --> 15:49.647
but we'll still return
as heroes if we capture
Captain Marvel.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.817
CAPTAIN MARVEL:
<i>Oh, that's not happening.</i>

15:56.255 --> 15:59.457
(SCREAMS)

15:59.459 --> 16:01.659
FALCON:  <i> Nice move,</i>
<i>Captain Marvel!</i>

16:01.661 --> 16:03.328
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.136
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

16:14.940 --> 16:16.474
THOR: Game over, Kree!

16:27.286 --> 16:30.755
The Sentries
that went out the airlock,
they're attacking the hull!

16:30.757 --> 16:32.824
They're too close.
Our ship's weapons
can't hit them.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.659
THOR:  <i> Then I have a plan.</i>

16:35.594 --> 16:37.829
(GRUNTING)

16:45.771 --> 16:47.271
(SHOUTS)

16:47.273 --> 16:51.009
There will be
no auto-repairing from that.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.177
FALCON:  <i> Too bad the ship</i>
<i>can't fix itself.</i>

16:53.179 --> 16:55.880
Stabilizers are offline.
Re-entry's gonna be rough.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.715
Thor, I need
some stabilization.

17:02.955 --> 17:06.023
You wanna play?
Fine. Let's play.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.565
(GRUNTS)

17:18.871 --> 17:20.872
CAPTAIN MARVEL: (LAUGHS)
I forgot to ask.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.207
Are you enjoying this
as much as I am?

17:23.209 --> 17:26.411
Yes! (ROARS)

17:26.413 --> 17:30.681
I will end you!
And your planet as well.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.284
Missiles, detach!

17:35.087 --> 17:38.156
CAPTAIN MARVEL:
In your dreams!

17:38.158 --> 17:40.158
GALEN-KOR:
Once those missiles
strike Earth,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.994
the gas will destroy
every human,

17:42.996 --> 17:47.398
leaving the Inhumans behind
for us to collect later.

17:48.100 --> 17:52.103
There's no way
you can stop them.

17:52.105 --> 17:55.773
The Kree thirst for victory
is unquenchable!

17:55.775 --> 17:58.376
(LAUGHS)
(GRUNTS)

17:58.378 --> 18:00.778
(THUDS)
I can't stop those missiles.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.681
But I know a team that can.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.284
Tony, you've got
incoming Kree missiles

18:06.286 --> 18:08.119
filled with deadly gas.
Think you can...

18:08.121 --> 18:10.555
IRON MAN: Stop them?
Consider it done.

18:10.557 --> 18:14.225
BLACK WIDOW:
We've got two minutes
until impact.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.395
Two minutes?
That's more time
than we usually get.

18:17.397 --> 18:20.364
Hulk, remember, we can't risk
setting off the missiles.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.600
So no smashing.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.203
No one appreciates
my talents.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.641
Gotcha!

18:34.546 --> 18:36.581
Listen up, team.
Take out the thruster

18:36.583 --> 18:38.216
and keep the payload
off the ground.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.650
I've got the first one.

18:59.738 --> 19:02.240
Somebody shut this thing off!

19:02.242 --> 19:03.574
I've got you, Hulk.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.585
Two down.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.356
Two to go.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.236
(GRUNTING)

19:33.372 --> 19:36.274
Wait, no smashing.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.142
(ROARS)

19:38.144 --> 19:39.443
(CHOMPS)

19:39.445 --> 19:42.213
Nobody said anything
about biting!

19:45.617 --> 19:47.852
BLACK WIDOW: Got it.
Last missile secured.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.791
That's how we do that.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.794
FALCON: Re-entry's
gonna be rough
without the stabilizers.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.230
Still think Captain Marvel
should be here doing this.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.698
CAPTAIN MARVEL:
<i>You got this.</i>

20:00.700 --> 20:02.400
<i>I know a good pilot</i>
<i>when I see one,</i>

20:02.402 --> 20:04.001
<i>and you're a good pilot,</i>
<i>Wilson.</i>

20:04.003 --> 20:06.470
Listen to her. She knows
what she's talking about.

20:06.472 --> 20:09.240
Oh, great. You two are
on the same side.

20:09.242 --> 20:12.577
Now I'm really scared.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.880
Air Force couldn't do
their job without Army.
And vice versa.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.348
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
<i>It's not a competition.</i>

20:17.350 --> 20:19.217
<i>Coming at a problem</i>
<i>from different sides</i>

20:19.219 --> 20:20.818
makes us stronger.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.688
CAPTAIN MARVEL:
<i>Cap's right, but it's totally</i>
<i>a competition.</i>

20:23.690 --> 20:26.324
Hey, where are we putting
this thing down?

20:26.326 --> 20:28.326
I don't want Thor
to get squashed!

20:35.267 --> 20:37.168
THOR: What of
the Inhuman captives?

20:37.170 --> 20:39.403
Attilan is glad
to have them back.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.273
I gave them the Kree ship
as a bonus.

20:42.275 --> 20:45.276
Hey, guys,
still not-exploded,
I see.

20:45.278 --> 20:48.279
Just came back
for my ride.

20:48.281 --> 20:52.250
While you were gone,
I made an upgrade
to your backup system.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.419
You upgraded my plane?
Without asking me?

20:59.258 --> 21:02.627
An Avengers ID?
You call this an upgrade?

21:02.629 --> 21:06.364
There's no better backup
than having a team
that's always got your back.

21:06.366 --> 21:10.301
Don't worry.
You can consider us reserves.

21:10.303 --> 21:13.037
(CHUCKLES) Call me anytime
you need me, Army.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.639
Or I'll call when I need you.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.112
Guys, we missed a drone!

21:21.114 --> 21:23.381
That's for Helsinki.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.850
You're adorable, Hawkeye.
