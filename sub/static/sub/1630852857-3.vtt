A NETFLIX SERIES

01:04.250 --> 01:06.750
-Why are you here?
-What did Margherita say to you?

01:09.250 --> 01:11.416
She came to compliment me on my writing.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.500
Is that all you came here for?

01:16.291 --> 01:17.708
I need to understand, Sofia.

01:20.083 --> 01:21.541
I didn't tell her anything.

01:23.541 --> 01:24.958
Why do you want to leave?

01:25.833 --> 01:27.416
I have no reason to stay.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.875
All your dreams are here.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.416
Exactly, nothing concrete.

01:34.333 --> 01:35.166
Don't go.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.583
Listen, Carlo,
everyone stares at me at the university.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.500
Your wife just stalked me
and gave me the third degree.

01:42.583 --> 01:45.708
And since that day, you've stopped
talking to me, looking at me.

01:45.791 --> 01:47.375
I know. I fucking know!

01:47.458 --> 01:49.125
It's hard for me too.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.208
Let's start over. Okay?

01:54.083 --> 01:58.833
I promise I'll make sure nothing else
that could get you in trouble happens.

02:00.458 --> 02:01.833
Come on, get off the train.

02:56.416 --> 02:57.250
Hi.

03:16.791 --> 03:18.250
-I said "hi."
-I heard.

03:25.750 --> 03:26.583
What's up?

03:30.666 --> 03:31.833
What did you do today?

03:33.083 --> 03:34.166
The usual.

03:34.875 --> 03:35.791
Oh yeah?

03:36.541 --> 03:37.500
"The usual."

03:41.208 --> 03:43.250
You really doubted me that much?

03:43.875 --> 03:44.916
I can't believe it.

03:46.375 --> 03:47.791
-"That much"?
-You know.

03:48.791 --> 03:50.125
No, I don't know. Tell me.

03:54.333 --> 03:57.250
How did it even cross your mind
to psychologically terrorize

03:57.333 --> 03:58.666
a 20-year-old girl?

03:59.333 --> 04:01.125
She went straight to tell you…

04:02.041 --> 04:04.750
Poor girl.
I imagine you've already consoled her.

04:07.291 --> 04:08.458
Why did you go see her?

04:09.666 --> 04:11.916
You talk to her so much.
I wanted to catch up.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.125
She quit the course.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.916
Are you happy now? It's all sorted.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.833
-So if she leaves, it's my fault?
-That's not the point.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.458
-No? What is?
-That you don't trust me anymore!

04:27.541 --> 04:29.208
-Should I?
-Yes, you should.

04:29.291 --> 04:32.041
Because things would be better,
much better.

04:32.666 --> 04:34.458
I needed to look her in the eyes.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.000
What did you see in her eyes?

04:37.083 --> 04:38.375
Come on, tell me!

04:39.166 --> 04:40.750
No, don't run away. Let's talk.

04:40.833 --> 04:43.250
What did you see in her eyes?
You were out of line!

04:43.333 --> 04:44.708
-"Out of line"?
-Yes!

04:44.791 --> 04:46.125
-I'm out of line?
-Yes!

04:46.208 --> 04:47.708
Carlo, you're out of line!

04:47.791 --> 04:50.458
You and your fucking face-to-face
or private lessons

04:50.541 --> 04:52.166
with the 20-year-old girl!

04:52.666 --> 04:53.875
Do you hear yourself?

04:54.708 --> 04:56.583
You've even become jealous of my job now!

04:56.666 --> 05:00.250
You think I take advantage of my position
to mess around with my students?

05:00.333 --> 05:03.000
-Is that it? Where are you going?
-How's the book going?

05:04.875 --> 05:06.833
-What's that got to do with this?
-Nothing.

05:06.916 --> 05:09.875
Just wondering if you tell her
you've been blocked for years.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.583
Who are you?
I don't recognize you anymore.

05:13.791 --> 05:14.750
I pity you.

06:11.375 --> 06:12.333
Hi, Mom.

06:32.458 --> 06:35.125
Was all that stuff really in Dad's office?

06:35.208 --> 06:36.125
Yeah.

06:39.416 --> 06:41.291
I could really use your help.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.541
There are boxes of your stuff too.

06:43.625 --> 06:46.041
I wrote your name on them
so you can take a look.

06:46.125 --> 06:47.666
You might want to keep something.

06:47.750 --> 06:50.541
Sure, I'll take them with me,
give you a bit more space.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.916
I'd like to have some memories of Dad too.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.750
This leg's driving me crazy.

07:04.333 --> 07:05.875
Want to tell me what happened?

07:06.625 --> 07:08.375
What did you and Carlo argue about?

07:09.583 --> 07:10.666
For Pete's sake, Mom!

07:11.333 --> 07:13.000
Didn't you and Dad ever argue?

07:14.750 --> 07:16.333
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

07:16.833 --> 07:20.000
So fine that you're here?
Come on! Who are you kidding?

07:20.083 --> 07:22.500
Oh God, Mom. Enough!
You're making me regret coming.

07:22.583 --> 07:26.500
Fine. You don't wanna talk?
I'll go back to minding my own business.

07:45.291 --> 07:46.791
Did you ever suspect anything?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.750
So you went in, she wasn't feeling well,

07:58.375 --> 07:59.791
and she fell into your arms?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.416
Are you fucking kidding me?

08:03.916 --> 08:06.625
Marco, for fuck's sake.
You sound like my wife.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.208
I was wrong to come here.

08:08.291 --> 08:10.125
You're a bit of a dick because…

08:10.208 --> 08:13.208
you asked a man who's been cheated on
to cheer you up. Please!

08:16.875 --> 08:18.500
I saw Giulia again.

08:23.375 --> 08:24.208
And?

08:24.708 --> 08:25.708
She's back.

08:26.541 --> 08:28.125
What do you mean, "she's back"?

08:29.250 --> 08:30.458
And how did you react?

08:33.500 --> 08:34.666
We fucked.

08:35.541 --> 08:36.916
-What the fuck?
-I swear.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.125
You had sex? Come on!

08:42.666 --> 08:44.333
So how did you leave things?

08:44.416 --> 08:46.541
I can't forget what happened.

08:46.625 --> 08:47.625
I can't do it.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.208
Well, I can understand that.

08:52.291 --> 08:54.541
If you're thinking about
cheating on Margherita,

08:54.625 --> 08:57.500
just know that if she finds out,
it'll be really shitty.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.250
And so are you.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.875
Feeling like this is unbearable, trust me.

09:05.041 --> 09:05.958
I know.

09:15.875 --> 09:18.208
<i>Beavers are semiaquatic rodents</i>

09:18.291 --> 09:20.916
<i>known for their ability to build dams.</i>

09:21.000 --> 09:24.333
<i>Beavers give their all</i>
<i>to stay safe in their habitat.</i>

09:37.083 --> 09:39.333
<i>Beavers are naturally monogamous.</i>

09:43.791 --> 09:44.958
CARLO
I'M AT YOUR MOM'S.

09:45.041 --> 09:46.416
YOU ALREADY AT THE GALLERY?

10:09.750 --> 10:12.166
CARLO
LAST SEEN TODAY AT 00:34

10:21.791 --> 10:24.083
ANDREA PHYSIOTHERAPIST
LAST SEEN YESTERDAY AT 17:11

10:24.916 --> 10:29.000
CAN I SEE YOU TOMORROW?

10:29.083 --> 10:32.083
I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN…

10:50.750 --> 10:51.958
It's about time!

10:53.708 --> 10:55.291
I had something to sort out.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.958
Did you sort them out
like you did Concordia?

10:59.958 --> 11:02.583
The clients who wanted to buy it called

11:02.666 --> 11:05.000
to ask if we have
anything similar available,

11:05.083 --> 11:07.666
since you told them
that one was no longer for sale.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.291
Hey, Marghe. What's going on?

11:19.333 --> 11:20.541
Eva, I screwed up.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.166
No, hang on.

11:22.875 --> 11:26.500
Blowing up a sale like that
is more than just "screwing up," okay?

11:26.583 --> 11:28.916
So if you could please
explain what's going on.

11:29.833 --> 11:32.000
I wanted the apartment for me and Carlo.

11:35.041 --> 11:38.458
I tried to stall. I wanted to find a way…

11:39.541 --> 11:40.875
You should've told me!

11:41.375 --> 11:42.208
I know.

11:42.708 --> 11:44.083
But everything got complicated,

11:44.166 --> 11:46.500
and I started doing things
that aren't like me.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.333
Maybe you don't realize what you've done.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.875
What am I supposed to do with you now?

11:54.541 --> 11:56.291
I'm your fucking partner!

11:58.916 --> 11:59.750
Eva…

12:00.416 --> 12:03.416
Eva, please. I won't make you
doubt me again. I swear.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.083
-We'll sell the apartment.
-No, it's best if I handle it.

12:06.166 --> 12:09.541
No, really. I'll handle it, Eva.
Believe me. We'll sort this out.

12:10.875 --> 12:13.916
Listen, Margherita,
I have a business meeting now. Okay?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.333
I want to be on time.

12:15.958 --> 12:18.958
We can't afford to lose any other clients.

12:19.041 --> 12:20.000
Okay?

12:35.625 --> 12:36.625
Good morning.

12:36.708 --> 12:38.375
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

12:39.791 --> 12:40.791
Good morning.

12:52.375 --> 12:56.833
One of the problems
that you are definitely going to face

12:56.916 --> 12:58.541
is in relation to endings.

12:58.625 --> 13:00.000
Or rather, when...

13:00.875 --> 13:04.166
to decide to put an end to your story,

13:04.250 --> 13:07.291
and, especially, how to end it.

13:07.833 --> 13:10.291
That is, whether it's better

13:10.375 --> 13:13.000
to use an open ending, a cliffhanger,

13:13.833 --> 13:15.083
or a bitter end,

13:15.166 --> 13:17.208
which is sometimes right and inevitable.

13:34.666 --> 13:35.500
Giulia?

13:36.500 --> 13:37.333
Marghe!

13:43.791 --> 13:44.791
How are you?

13:45.750 --> 13:47.500
It's best if we sit down for that.

13:49.083 --> 13:53.125
I ordered you a super detox,
with dandelion and all that.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.291
Thank you.

13:57.541 --> 14:00.416
-It's as awful as my life is. Excuse me?
-Yes?

14:00.500 --> 14:02.750
Can I get a double whiskey?
And a prosecco.

14:02.833 --> 14:05.750
-You still like prosecco, right?
-Yes, great.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.041
Sorry.

14:12.708 --> 14:15.958
I'm sorry.
I've behaved terribly towards you too.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.583
It upset me, Giulia.

14:21.958 --> 14:24.916
It's such a big deal,
and you didn't say a word.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
I'm your friend.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.166
I didn't know how to tell you.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.958
Everything I was certain about collapsed,

14:31.541 --> 14:32.875
and so did my nerve.

14:33.583 --> 14:34.458
And…

14:38.666 --> 14:39.750
Tell me about it.

14:41.541 --> 14:42.500
How did it start?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.250
I met him at the gallery.

14:45.416 --> 14:48.041
He's a French painter
who came to stay in Milan for a while.

14:48.666 --> 14:52.375
He does beautiful paintings
with Renaissance architectural references.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.375
And?

14:54.708 --> 14:55.666
He liked me.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.000
He was all over me.

14:58.791 --> 15:02.458
He waited for me every night after work.
Marco and I were having trouble.

15:02.541 --> 15:04.041
I was exhausted,

15:05.416 --> 15:06.500
and I gave up.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.208
I slept with him.

15:08.291 --> 15:09.916
I enjoyed it too.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.250
I liked myself. He made me feel good.

15:12.916 --> 15:13.875
And now?

15:13.958 --> 15:15.375
I don't care about him.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.916
I fucked up with Marco.
I don't know how to fix it.

15:21.416 --> 15:22.250
Here you go.

15:22.833 --> 15:23.750
Thank you.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.166
-You can take…
-Yes.

15:30.833 --> 15:32.291
Take it easy.

15:32.375 --> 15:35.625
Now isn't the time to take it easy,
but to get to the point.

15:36.750 --> 15:37.666
Come on, spill.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.625
What did Marco tell Carlo last night?

15:43.375 --> 15:44.333
Carlo?

15:44.416 --> 15:46.541
They met, right?
When the bistro was closing.

15:46.625 --> 15:49.083
Marco said I couldn't stop by
as he had to see Carlo.

15:54.166 --> 15:55.708
Oh God, it was bullshit.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.041
He has another woman.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.833
No, absolutely not. No.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.541
Giulia, listen to me.

16:05.625 --> 16:08.125
I went to sleep early last night,
got up early today.

16:08.208 --> 16:11.125
I left without seeing Carlo. That's why…

16:11.208 --> 16:12.833
It's the truth, isn't it?

16:13.583 --> 16:14.458
Yes.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.333
Because I know how it works
when there's a betrayal.

16:18.416 --> 16:20.875
It's one lie after another.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.208
-Excuse me?
-Yes.

16:26.583 --> 16:29.125
The surprise is crucial.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.750
What you're missing here
is a nice plot twist,

16:31.833 --> 16:34.000
something unexpected, and then it's done.

16:34.083 --> 16:34.916
Got it.

16:35.541 --> 16:38.250
But kudos, it's great work. Well done.

16:38.750 --> 16:39.583
Thank you.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.875
Is your life really so lively?

16:42.958 --> 16:44.416
No, not really.

16:46.083 --> 16:47.875
I did employ a bit of fantasy.

16:47.958 --> 16:48.916
Okay.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.083
What else am I supposed to do
if I haven't had any shitty times?

16:53.875 --> 16:57.041
Nothing wrong with making it up
if it results in a great story.

16:57.125 --> 16:59.666
-Thank you very much.
-Kudos. See you tomorrow.

16:59.750 --> 17:00.833
-Bye.
-Bye.

17:47.625 --> 17:49.500
Sorry, I forgot to put on shorts.

17:50.458 --> 17:51.541
Don't worry.

18:18.708 --> 18:19.916
Is this the spot?

18:22.875 --> 18:24.833
Maybe a little more to the left.

18:32.416 --> 18:33.458
To the left?

18:46.291 --> 18:47.291
More?

19:10.833 --> 19:13.625
Via Filippo Sassetti, 32. Thank you.

19:13.708 --> 19:14.833
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

19:16.166 --> 19:19.541
<i>The Pescara 52 taxi will arrive</i>
<i>in four minutes.</i>

19:19.625 --> 19:20.875
<i>If you accept, hang up.</i>

19:25.250 --> 19:26.125
Need a ride?

19:27.458 --> 19:28.333
No.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.958
I called a taxi. Thank you.

19:34.041 --> 19:35.416
Maybe some other time.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.166
Anytime.

20:01.791 --> 20:03.458
I got off at the next stop.

20:05.416 --> 20:08.208
So you had no valid excuse
for being absent today.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.125
No, I had a valid excuse.

20:10.208 --> 20:13.041
I couldn't tear myself away
from the chapters of a novel.

20:14.541 --> 20:17.375
And it made me want
to try and write one again.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.500
What book is that?

20:20.041 --> 20:20.875
Yours.

20:22.875 --> 20:23.958
Did you like it?

20:24.750 --> 20:25.625
A lot.

20:28.416 --> 20:31.333
I relate to the way you describe pain.

20:31.416 --> 20:32.375
"Pain"?

20:33.166 --> 20:35.166
Are you sure you read my book?

20:37.458 --> 20:38.750
I don't describe pain.

20:40.625 --> 20:41.458
Really?

20:44.250 --> 20:46.125
What upset you so much the other day?

20:48.833 --> 20:51.041
It wasn't the first time
it happened to me.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.291
I have sudden flashbacks

20:54.083 --> 20:56.500
about something
I thought I'd put behind me,

20:56.583 --> 20:58.625
but actually, it's still here.

21:01.416 --> 21:02.500
Does it hurt?

21:05.125 --> 21:06.083
Use it.

21:07.541 --> 21:09.083
Use that pain to write.

21:10.250 --> 21:12.416
I can't find the words to describe it.

21:14.125 --> 21:15.791
I should invent some new ones.

21:16.541 --> 21:18.916
Wonderful. Do it!
What are you waiting for?

21:19.416 --> 21:21.541
You're free. You can do whatever you want.

21:21.625 --> 21:23.333
I told Leonardo the same.

21:23.416 --> 21:26.916
In writing,
you don't have to follow all the rules.

21:30.875 --> 21:32.916
I really needed to talk to you.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.083
Come on, let's go.

21:37.666 --> 21:38.541
Where?

21:39.708 --> 21:41.666
The perfect place to find words.

21:56.875 --> 21:57.708
There we go.

21:58.208 --> 22:00.541
This is one of my favorite authors.

22:00.625 --> 22:02.416
Once you've read this,

22:02.500 --> 22:05.291
you'll want to finish the trilogy
and read the others.

22:07.166 --> 22:09.958
"The difference between what we want
and what we're afraid of

22:10.041 --> 22:11.750
is about the width of an eyelash."

22:13.750 --> 22:16.916
Are you saying that, at 20,
you've already read all McInerney,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.833
and I don't have
such refined tastes after all?

22:19.916 --> 22:21.958
-I should've indulged you.
-You should've.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.125
Carlo!

22:23.208 --> 22:25.125
-Luca.
-How nice to see you here. Hi.

22:27.041 --> 22:27.875
Hi.

22:28.541 --> 22:31.666
This is Sofia, one of my students.
This is Luca.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.875
He's my publisher.

22:33.958 --> 22:35.125
Nice to meet you.

22:35.666 --> 22:36.625
Charmed.

22:37.833 --> 22:41.125
Luca is <i>the </i>person to know
if you want to publish your first book

22:41.708 --> 22:44.125
and the one to avoid
if you have to send him another.

22:44.208 --> 22:47.375
-Speaking of which, I--
-I'm about to give you something.

22:49.291 --> 22:51.833
Do you know how many times
I've heard that? Loads!

22:51.916 --> 22:55.916
Please don't ever say that.
Instead, be one of the rare writers

22:56.000 --> 22:58.166
who don't keep publishers on edge.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.583
I'll bear that in mind. Thanks.

23:01.416 --> 23:02.750
Thanks, Luca.

23:02.833 --> 23:03.666
Yeah.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.166
You did the right thing,

23:05.250 --> 23:07.833
bringing students to events like this.

23:07.916 --> 23:10.416
If there wasn't such a sharp divide,
let's say,

23:10.500 --> 23:13.041
between practice and theory
in writing schools,

23:13.125 --> 23:16.875
maybe I'd read less nonsense.<i> </i>Right?

23:18.166 --> 23:19.166
Yeah.

23:20.916 --> 23:21.750
Yes!

23:22.458 --> 23:25.250
Well, I'm off to play host. Bye.

23:25.333 --> 23:26.416
See you later.

23:28.750 --> 23:31.916
Clearly, I have no idea
what event he's talking about.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.541
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

23:34.625 --> 23:35.583
No, it's okay.

23:35.666 --> 23:38.166
Besides, I don't want
to disappoint your publisher.

24:01.291 --> 24:02.625
I'll get out the way.

24:03.541 --> 24:04.666
Thank you.

24:05.208 --> 24:08.375
So, I was saying,
obviously, I'm to blame for the delay.

24:08.458 --> 24:09.541
-I apologize.
-Hi.

24:10.125 --> 24:11.416
Welcome, everyone.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.125
-A round of applause!
-Thank you.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.666
-Shall I read an excerpt?
-Sure, why not?

24:24.041 --> 24:26.583
"We need something that ends now

24:26.666 --> 24:28.541
so that it won't end later."

24:29.041 --> 24:32.916
"A ghost with future memory,
the sweet regret that will come."

24:33.958 --> 24:35.958
"That thing that we could recall

24:36.041 --> 24:39.708
to say that we had another chance."

24:40.916 --> 24:43.750
So, in your book,
you're talking about how fascinating

24:43.833 --> 24:46.041
the idea of things
we haven't experienced is,

24:46.125 --> 24:49.416
and how we mythologize
the idea, the thought

24:49.500 --> 24:52.708
of what might have been but was not.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.250
Yes, more or less.

24:54.750 --> 24:56.541
Excuse me, has anyone read the book?

24:56.625 --> 24:58.166
Other than me, of course.

24:58.958 --> 25:00.541
-Hi! What's your name?
-Sofia.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.166
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

25:02.250 --> 25:05.875
Yes, I was thinking that,
in the end, Ms. Grilli...

25:05.958 --> 25:07.291
Be informal. Thanks.

25:08.083 --> 25:12.708
You imply that what makes us
truly interesting and happy

25:12.791 --> 25:15.833
are the possibilities
we had the courage to explore,

25:15.916 --> 25:17.791
not just dream about.

25:18.291 --> 25:20.333
I seem to remember a passage,

25:21.166 --> 25:24.625
"Life is what remains
after every crossroad."

25:24.708 --> 25:26.458
-"Crossroad." Well done.
-Yes.

25:26.541 --> 25:28.916
And so the responsibility

25:29.000 --> 25:31.750
to choose the direction is ours alone.

25:32.250 --> 25:35.041
Well, you understood it
better than my publisher!

25:37.958 --> 25:40.916
I'll draw inspiration
from Sofia's beautiful words

25:41.000 --> 25:43.500
to talk about choice and responsibility.

25:43.583 --> 25:48.333
I think that during this difficult time,
it's important to use these two words…

25:51.500 --> 25:53.708
So you've also read Grilli's book?

25:53.791 --> 25:54.708
Yes!

25:55.375 --> 25:57.125
-How is it?
-Great!

25:57.208 --> 25:58.458
I can lend it to you.

26:01.083 --> 26:02.333
Shall we get a drink?

26:04.583 --> 26:06.791
No. We'd better not.

26:06.875 --> 26:09.625
Even if we get two glasses
from the refreshments?

26:10.250 --> 26:11.083
No.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.375
Okay.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.291
See you in class, then.

26:17.041 --> 26:17.958
Okay.

26:44.291 --> 26:45.250
Hello, Anna?

26:45.791 --> 26:46.625
Hi.

26:47.708 --> 26:49.166
Is Margherita still there?

27:01.958 --> 27:03.166
Marghe, will you get it?

27:05.083 --> 27:05.916
Yes.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.541
What are you doing here?

27:24.625 --> 27:25.750
Why are you here?

27:28.583 --> 27:29.833
To take you home.

27:31.458 --> 27:32.500
How?

27:35.625 --> 27:36.541
By car.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.458
I hate what's happened to us.

27:51.291 --> 27:52.166
So do I.

27:53.791 --> 27:55.291
I can't be without you.

27:57.625 --> 27:59.125
I love you so much, Marghe.

28:03.791 --> 28:05.708
I missed you so much last night.

28:13.458 --> 28:14.375
Likewise.

28:20.625 --> 28:21.791
Let's go home.

30:32.958 --> 30:34.708
News about the Concordia apartment?

30:36.958 --> 30:39.666
The online ad is getting tons of views,

30:40.583 --> 30:43.250
but I haven't had
any viewing requests yet.

30:47.125 --> 30:48.750
I'll sell it. You'll see.

30:48.833 --> 30:50.250
How much time do you need?

30:51.875 --> 30:54.000
I'm committed to it. I told you.

30:54.625 --> 30:57.208
I mean, how much time do <i>you</i> need

30:57.791 --> 30:59.166
to make an offer?

31:02.625 --> 31:03.750
Cigarette?

31:07.916 --> 31:10.375
I slept at my mom's a few days ago.

31:11.708 --> 31:13.250
I'd never done that before.

31:14.541 --> 31:17.000
Leaving after a fight with Carlo, I mean.

31:17.541 --> 31:19.041
It's not the end of the world.

31:19.750 --> 31:20.750
And now?

31:23.083 --> 31:25.041
We've made up, but...

31:26.625 --> 31:27.833
it's weird.

31:28.625 --> 31:29.833
"Weird," how?

31:31.708 --> 31:34.583
I don't know if things
can go back to the way they were.

31:35.625 --> 31:38.125
-Have you got another man?
-What? No!

31:38.208 --> 31:41.541
Sorry, but lately I've noticed
a new glint in your eyes.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.541
But maybe my instincts are wrong.

31:44.625 --> 31:45.666
Sometimes.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.916
Maybe Carlo has a little something
with one of his students.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.583
What does "a little something" mean?
No such thing as a little cheating.

31:53.666 --> 31:55.500
It would be hell if there were.

31:55.583 --> 31:58.666
But there are desires, fantasies.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.041
I get it. If we paid heed
to desires and fantasies,

32:01.125 --> 32:03.750
we'd all constantly feel like cheaters.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.375
You should see your face right now.

32:20.250 --> 32:22.833
-Bye, guys. See you tomorrow.
-Goodbye.

32:24.791 --> 32:26.750
Sorry, but I can't. It makes me…

32:26.833 --> 32:28.291
-Wasn't it planned?
-Yeah.

32:41.500 --> 32:46.041
Luca! Listen, I know you're really busy,
but are you coming to the symposium?

32:46.125 --> 32:48.375
I wanted you
to have a chat with the students.

33:39.791 --> 33:40.625
Hi.

33:40.708 --> 33:42.000
Going out tonight?

33:42.083 --> 33:43.541
No, I'm going home.

33:44.375 --> 33:46.583
-Have a nice evening, then.
-Bye.

33:50.958 --> 33:52.375
-Bye.
-Have a nice evening.

33:58.791 --> 34:00.291
-Bye.
-Bye, Andrea.

34:31.958 --> 34:33.416
<i>Radio Taxi Milan.</i>

34:39.583 --> 34:40.458
Get on.

34:41.125 --> 34:42.625
I'll take you home. It's late.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.250
All right.

34:49.583 --> 34:50.833
But don't take me home.

35:00.958 --> 35:02.041
Where are we going?

35:03.416 --> 35:04.375
Wherever you want.

38:06.958 --> 38:12.208
