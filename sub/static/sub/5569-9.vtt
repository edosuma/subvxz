00:11.846 --> 00:13.812
I'll be going to the hamptons
for thanksgiving

00:13.814 --> 00:15.514
With the radwells.
I'm pregnant!

00:26.827 --> 00:28.394
Hey, chanel?

00:28.396 --> 00:30.329
Listen. I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

00:30.331 --> 00:32.731
But I don't think
I can bone you right now.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.333
My wanger is way stressed out.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.635
I got a kid on the way with
a crazy neck-braced baby mama

00:36.637 --> 00:38.804
Who I now gotta marry
and be miserable for
the rest of my life.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.006
You don't have to marry
that psycho cow hester,

00:41.008 --> 00:42.841
Because you don't have
a baby on the way...

00:42.843 --> 00:44.977
If you know what I mean.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.645
No, I-I don't know
what you mean.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.080
I have killed for love, chad.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.415
I've killed for our love.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.516
Wh... What?

00:50.518 --> 00:52.251
Chad, hester was never pregnant.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.585
She just said that so you'd
invite her to thanksgiving

00:53.587 --> 00:54.920
With your family
in the hamptons.

00:54.922 --> 00:56.155
But then

00:56.157 --> 00:57.523
She had a little accident

00:57.525 --> 00:58.824
On the stairs.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.025
A what?

01:00.027 --> 01:02.061
Wait, are-are you saying
you killed hester?

01:02.063 --> 01:04.063
Gravity killed hester.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.564
I just gave her a little push.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.666
Hester can't come
between us anymore, chad.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.435
You and I can pick up
right where we left off.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.070
You can bring me home
for thanksgiving

01:11.072 --> 01:12.905
And introduce me
to my future in-laws.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.773
Hold on.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.075
What did you do with the body?

01:16.077 --> 01:18.077
Duh.
I put it in the meat locker.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.411
It's where we've been putting
all the dead bodies.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.014
Oh, my god.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.248
(exhales)

01:23.250 --> 01:25.784
Chanel, that is so hot.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.086
I want to see it.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.754
I need to see the body.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.923
Look, we can have
a three-way with the body.
What? No!

01:30.925 --> 01:32.925
Oh, come on, I need this!

01:32.927 --> 01:34.927
If you expect me to take our
relationship to the next level

01:34.929 --> 01:37.429
By taking you home to
the hamptons for thanksgiving,

01:37.431 --> 01:39.098
You're going to have to prove
to me you can meet my needs.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.467
Ugh, fine!
I'll show you the body,

01:41.469 --> 01:43.902
But not so you can
have sex with it.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.437
I'll show it to you

01:45.439 --> 01:47.072
So that you and I will
share a dangerous secret

01:47.074 --> 01:48.907
That will strengthen
our relationship

01:48.909 --> 01:50.876
And bring us closer together.

01:57.918 --> 02:00.285
No frigging way.
Where is she?

02:00.287 --> 02:02.087
I don't understand
how this keeps happening!

02:02.089 --> 02:03.755
Is this meat locker,
like, a wormhole

02:03.757 --> 02:04.923
To an alternate
universe or something?

02:04.925 --> 02:06.592
Okay, chanel, you gotta relax.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.760
Believe me,
no one's more disappointed

02:08.762 --> 02:10.295
That hester's hot dead bod
isn't in here.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.597
Listen.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.098
I'm not a detective or anything,

02:13.100 --> 02:14.766
But what if hester
was never dead

02:14.768 --> 02:16.101
And she just managed to escape?

02:16.103 --> 02:17.469
That's not possible!

02:17.471 --> 02:19.104
I watched her
fall down the stairs!

02:19.106 --> 02:21.773
After she fell down the stairs,
did you check her pulse?

02:21.775 --> 02:24.109
No, chad, because I'm not,
like, a registered nurse.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.911
Well, chanel, it seems to me

02:25.913 --> 02:27.246
Like you tried to kill hester
and totally failed.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.647
So you should
probably bring

02:28.649 --> 02:30.115
A security detail with you

02:30.117 --> 02:31.917
To the hamptons because...
The girl's insane.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.485
She'll probably stop at nothing

02:33.487 --> 02:35.154
Until she gets her revenge
by murdering you.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.762
Gigi:
No offense,

02:43.764 --> 02:46.932
But this is not how
I wanted to spend the holidays.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.800
I should be watching
the macy's parade

02:48.802 --> 02:52.804
And making decorative hand
turkeys with my boyfriend, wes,

02:52.806 --> 02:55.440
Instead of spending thanksgiving
all single

02:55.442 --> 02:58.510
And watching
the dumb parade with you.

02:58.512 --> 03:02.114
Still, I do appreciate
you keeping me company.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.983
No one wants to spend

03:04.985 --> 03:07.052
A room service
thanksgiving alone.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.957
Are you going
to talk at all?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.796
Look, I get it.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.798
You're bummed we had
to murder your brother.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.166
But honestly?
(scoffs)

03:21.168 --> 03:22.968
You shouldn't
be mad at me.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.970
Boone was out
of control.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.239

03:27.241 --> 03:29.675

03:29.677 --> 03:32.644

thanksgiving.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.152
Yes!

03:47.261 --> 03:49.761
Roasted quail and
a side of stuffing

03:49.763 --> 03:52.097
And a cranberry juice.

03:52.099 --> 03:55.167
Oh, I had asked for an electric
serrated carving knife.

03:55.169 --> 03:56.835

09:37.744 --> 09:39.444
(screams)

09:39.446 --> 09:41.079
(screams)
oh, my god.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.749
Would you stop
with the screaming?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.520
What are you doing here?

09:48.522 --> 09:50.088
I came to slaughter old tiburon.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.357
Wait, isn't that the turkey you
pardoned on the quad yesterday?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.925
Yes. Good old tiburon.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.760
You don't think
we would actually

09:55.762 --> 09:57.128
Pardon a turkey, do you?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.863
It's more like
a stay of execution

09:58.865 --> 10:00.632
Until no one is looking.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.400
But why here?

10:02.402 --> 10:04.903
Ah. Well, I was disinvited

10:04.905 --> 10:07.439
To thanksgiving at my in-laws'

10:07.441 --> 10:09.808
Because they still think
that I killed their son,

10:09.810 --> 10:11.409
My jerk-off ex-husband,

10:11.411 --> 10:13.078
So I'm kind of
on my own.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.312
Plus, you girls have

10:14.314 --> 10:15.914
The best cooking facilities
on campus,

10:15.916 --> 10:17.616
Although it doesn't look like
you ever use them.

10:17.618 --> 10:18.917
Why are<i> you</i> here?

10:18.919 --> 10:21.086
My family thanksgiving sucked,
so I came here.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.754
Mmm.
Hey...

10:22.756 --> 10:25.290
Since you already have a turkey,
why don't we just cook here?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.258
I've never cooked before,
but that should be fine,

10:27.260 --> 10:28.760
Since I usually
just pretend to eat.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.496
Well, I can cook and eat

10:31.498 --> 10:33.632
For the both of us.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.368
But I demand that after we eat,
we play charades.
Deal.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.143
♪ ♪

10:49.449 --> 10:51.516
(phone ringing)

10:57.090 --> 10:58.123
(sighs)

10:58.125 --> 10:59.457
Hi, dad.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.092
Hey, where are you?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.427
You promised me
you'd at least come by here

11:02.429 --> 11:03.795
Before you flew to oakland
with zayday.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.630
Yeah, we decided not to go.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.098
You're in town?
Where are you?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.433
We're at kappa.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.934
We felt weird
leaving the house all alone.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.937
Besides, dean munsch
and chanel #3 are here.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.606
So we've decided to have
an orphans thanksgiving

11:14.608 --> 11:15.607
All together.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.175
But you're not an orphan.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.843
Your dad is ten minutes away.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.178
Thanksgiving?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.947
Honey, it's kind of like
our cranberry jam.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.315
Where's gigi?

11:24.317 --> 11:26.384
I don't know.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.386
She just didn't show up.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.555
Oh, no, no,
number three.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.891
You pull the feathers the
way they lay on the bird.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.226
And don't pull too many
or you'll tear the skin.

11:35.228 --> 11:38.630
I mean, I guess you
could come over here

11:38.632 --> 11:39.964
If you wanted.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.901
Okay, um, only
if it's okay with you.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.135
Yeah, I mean, it's fine.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.570
I'll see you soon.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.405
Yes, I'll see you.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.141
(dinging)

11:51.912 --> 11:55.080
Mrs. Radwell:
Welcome, everyone.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.414
It is so nice
you could all make it home

11:56.416 --> 11:59.084
For another radwell
family thanksgiving.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.820
We have a newcomer this year.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.322
So, let's all give a round

12:04.324 --> 12:06.391
Of tolerant radwell applause

12:06.393 --> 12:08.393
To our newcomer

12:08.395 --> 12:11.896
Chanel... Oberlin.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.168
Yes, welcome, chanel.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.437
Chad hasn't mentioned you...
Ever.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.607
Before we, uh, dig into
this delicious feast

12:22.609 --> 12:25.777
That mrs. Radwell
has spent all day overseeing,

12:25.779 --> 12:27.846
Let us honor the timeworn,

12:27.848 --> 12:30.014
Age-old radwell tradition

12:30.016 --> 12:32.083
Of standing up,
stating our names

12:32.085 --> 12:35.019
And saying what we're
thankful for this year.

12:35.021 --> 12:38.022
I'm tad radwell
and I am thankful

12:38.024 --> 12:40.024
That the turmoil
in the fertile crescent

12:40.026 --> 12:42.861
Has not impacted
this family's wealth.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.900
I am bunny radwell

12:48.902 --> 12:51.236
And I'm thankful
that the radwell family name

12:51.238 --> 12:53.404
Continues to be
one of the oldest bloodlines

12:53.406 --> 12:55.473
In america.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.575
Who exactly

12:57.577 --> 13:00.078
Are the oberlins, chanel?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.414
Mrs. Radwell, I am happy to
report that the oberlin family

13:03.416 --> 13:06.584
Is a well-established
american dynasty.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.987
A little known fact
is that my great-great-

13:08.989 --> 13:11.289
Great-great grandfather
ichabod oberlin actually

13:11.291 --> 13:13.958
Signed the declaration
of independence.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.927
It's only "little known"
because he was

13:15.929 --> 13:17.328
The last one to sign it,
so there was no more room

13:17.330 --> 13:19.097
For him to put
his name on the front,

13:19.099 --> 13:21.432
So he had to flip it over
and put his name on the back.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.502
Oh, also the oberlins came
over on the<i> mayflower.</i>

13:24.504 --> 13:26.137
Oh, well,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.740
The radwells came over on a ship

13:28.742 --> 13:31.109
That arrived 30 years
before the<i> mayflower.</i>

13:31.111 --> 13:33.411
So...

13:33.413 --> 13:36.781
(clears throat)
I'm thad radwell.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.450
And this year
I'm so thankful for the lax

13:39.452 --> 13:41.319
Indecency laws in eastern europe

13:41.321 --> 13:44.923
That inundate our internet
with millions of hours

13:44.925 --> 13:48.092
Of hard-core porn.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.595
Which helps to just
generally raise the bar

13:50.597 --> 13:52.263
On the stuff that chicks feel
like they have to do now.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.165
I mean, am I right?

13:56.002 --> 13:58.002
Come on, let's go, blue!

13:58.939 --> 14:01.272
Hello.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.641
I'm muffy st. Pierre-radwell.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.611
And I am so, so thankful

14:06.613 --> 14:09.047
For my husband brad.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.949
And also that I'm starting
my very own new clothing line,

14:10.951 --> 14:12.550
And it's gonna be so...
Hey, everyone.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.719
I'm brad radwell.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.221
And for the third
year in a row,

14:16.223 --> 14:17.555
I am thankful that I work

14:17.557 --> 14:19.791
At l.A.'s hottest talent agency,

14:19.793 --> 14:22.060
Accentuated artists, huh?

14:22.062 --> 14:24.062
Up high-- boom!
Boom!

14:24.064 --> 14:25.797
You know, ever since
I was a little boy,

14:25.799 --> 14:28.066
I knew what god wanted me to do
and that was make money

14:28.068 --> 14:30.635
Off the backs
of creative people.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.072
(grunts)

14:34.074 --> 14:36.341
Hello, I'm chad radwell.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.575
This year I'm thankful

14:37.577 --> 14:39.010
For someone

14:39.012 --> 14:41.012
Who's very special to me.

14:41.014 --> 14:44.916
Without this person, I wouldn't
be the man I am right now.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.752
In fact,
I wouldn't be here at all.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.555
I am, of course,
referring to the serial killer

14:50.557 --> 14:52.924
Who's stalking the campus
of wallace university.

14:52.926 --> 14:55.226
I am so thankful that he,
for whatever reason,

14:55.228 --> 14:56.728
Has not murdered me yet.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.297
I am so, so grateful.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.734
I'm also thankful
to that serial killer

15:02.736 --> 15:05.403
For not killing you, chad.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.907
And that you will have
a long, long, long life.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.910
You have such
a vast future ahead of you.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.412
You'll meet so many new
and different women.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.115
So many wonderful women
to go out with

15:17.117 --> 15:19.951
And break up with

15:19.953 --> 15:21.286
And move on from.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.254
You should be thankful
that this table is

15:23.256 --> 15:25.957
Too long for me to reach across
and strangle you, bitch!

15:25.959 --> 15:27.859
(gasps)
excuse me,

15:27.861 --> 15:29.294
But another guest
has arrived.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.896
A lady by the name of... Hester.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.299
Oh, god, no, no, no, no!

15:34.301 --> 15:35.566
(gasps)

15:35.568 --> 15:37.468
Happy thanksgiving, radwells.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.070
I'm sorry I'm late.

15:39.072 --> 15:39.904
Oh, god.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.472
What did I miss?

15:47.981 --> 15:51.082
I hope I haven't
kept you waiting.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.317
I'm famished.
I beg your pardon.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.818
But who are you?

15:53.820 --> 15:55.453
Uh, she is

15:55.455 --> 15:57.088
My-my sober coach.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.656
What?

15:58.658 --> 16:00.425
Chad, I didn't know
you had a drinking problem.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.926
Neither did I.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.062
That is how insidious
alcoholism is, dad.

16:04.965 --> 16:05.997
That's true.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.498
Let me help you put this
on your lap.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.134
What are you doing here?
How are you alive?

16:10.136 --> 16:11.936
Good thing I was wearing this
neck brace when you pushed me

16:11.938 --> 16:13.771
Down the stairs,
because it saved my life.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.573
And laying me on the ground
in the meat locker

16:15.575 --> 16:17.075
Was the perfect thing to do.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.743
The hard slab of the cold steel

16:18.745 --> 16:20.311
Curbed the swelling
in my spinal column.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.946
When I woke up
and regained consciousness,

16:21.948 --> 16:23.781
I felt better than ever.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.116
Really, I should be
thanking you right now.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.751
That fall?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.252
It might have cured me
of my severe scoliosis.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.822
Dinner is served.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.424
Radwells?

16:33.426 --> 16:35.159
I have an announcement to make.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.296
This is a blessed occasion.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.631
Because I am carrying

16:40.633 --> 16:43.167
A little bit of each one of you

16:43.169 --> 16:45.436
Inside of me.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.306
I have a little radwell

16:48.308 --> 16:49.607
Inside of me.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.276
I'm having chad's baby!

16:52.278 --> 16:53.811
(groaning)

16:53.813 --> 16:55.713
We're so happy.
Chanel: That's a lie!

16:55.715 --> 16:58.383
I saw her eat sushi,
soft cheese and booze!

16:58.385 --> 17:00.385
Enough!

17:00.387 --> 17:03.955
Chad, I have never
been so ashamed!

17:03.957 --> 17:06.891
You have besmirched the
radwell family thanksgiving

17:06.893 --> 17:09.794
By bringing home not one

17:09.796 --> 17:12.797
But<i> two</i> gold-digging hoochies!

17:12.799 --> 17:14.065
I'm sorry, but maybe
you didn't hear me.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.834
I'm carrying
your future grandchild!

17:16.836 --> 17:19.404
You listen to me,
you swarthy little runt.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.072
We have
an entire legal team

17:21.074 --> 17:22.907
At bender, bender & stanwyk
on retainer

17:22.909 --> 17:25.076
Just to make spurious
paternity claims

17:25.078 --> 17:28.813
Like yours simply go away.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.848
(crying):
But I'm carrying
your son's seed.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.517
The only thing you're carrying
is water weight,

17:32.519 --> 17:35.319
You bloated little tramp.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.155
That's not a baby bump.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.057
That's a poo belly.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.059
(echoing):
<i>Poo belly, poo belly,</i>

17:41.061 --> 17:43.394
<i>Poo belly, poo belly...</i>

17:43.396 --> 17:44.762
Now,

17:44.764 --> 17:46.064
Would someone please

17:46.066 --> 17:48.399
Pass me the stuffing?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.068
(all sigh)

17:50.070 --> 17:52.737
Wow, who knew it took so
long to cook a turkey?

17:52.739 --> 17:55.573
All right, ladies, weston,
let's head into the dining room,

17:55.575 --> 17:58.743
Where we fill up on peking
ravioli and charcuterie.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.912
I have a little game to play

18:00.914 --> 18:03.014
That's gonna
make the time fly right by.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.949
Hmm.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.452
Yes, it's simple.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.787
We're gonna go around,
and each of us is gonna

18:09.789 --> 18:13.291
Make our case as to who we
think the red devil killer is.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.792
I'll go first.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.761
I think we can all agree that

18:16.763 --> 18:18.062
One of the red devil killers
is boone.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.564
I propose

18:19.566 --> 18:23.434
That the other
red devil killer is...

18:23.436 --> 18:24.936
Chanel #3.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.070
What?

18:26.072 --> 18:28.072
No, I've never killed anyone

18:28.074 --> 18:29.407
As far as I know.

18:29.409 --> 18:32.910
But your real daddy has,
baby manson.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.912
Grace:
Okay, there is
no evidence at all

18:34.914 --> 18:37.448
That mass murder is genetic.
Wait, her dad

18:37.450 --> 18:39.584
Is charles manson--
how do I not know this?

18:39.586 --> 18:40.985
Munsch: I'm not saying
it's anything more

18:40.987 --> 18:42.920
Than pepper in the soup,

18:42.922 --> 18:45.923
Seasoning for a big fat dish

18:45.925 --> 18:48.593
Of well-cooked evidence.
Such as?

18:48.595 --> 18:51.429
Item one--
the chain saw attack at kappa.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.163
(screaming)

18:56.002 --> 18:58.569
<i>I was probably</i>
<i>the last one to wake up</i>

18:58.571 --> 19:02.073
<i>And come downstairs that night.</i>

19:02.075 --> 19:04.408
<i>I saw chanel #3</i>

19:04.410 --> 19:05.943
<i>Running up the back stairway,</i>

19:05.945 --> 19:07.812
<i>Face glowing with</i>
<i>perspiration,</i>

19:07.814 --> 19:10.915
<i>Trying to sneak</i>
<i>into her room undetected.</i>

19:10.917 --> 19:14.318
I would say that is more
than a little suspicious.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.920
I have bathroom shame issues.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.623
I always wait until everyone is
asleep and then I sneak

19:18.625 --> 19:20.625
Down to poop in the little
powder room downstairs.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.827
That way, no one
will disturb me.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.428
I usually wait a week or so
between movements,

19:24.430 --> 19:26.998
So it can be kind of an intense
workout-- I sweat a lot.

19:27.000 --> 19:27.999
(coughs):
Yeah, right.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.433
Um, okay, even still,

19:29.435 --> 19:30.801
How could she possibly be

19:30.803 --> 19:32.003
Charles manson's
daughter

19:32.005 --> 19:34.105
And one of the babies
in the bathtub?

19:34.107 --> 19:36.007
I mean, don't we all agree that
those babies are the killers?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.441
Do we even have any evidence

19:37.443 --> 19:40.311
That this manson story is true?

19:40.313 --> 19:43.881
How do we know
she didn't just invent it

19:43.883 --> 19:47.451
Just so we wouldn't think
she was the killer?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.621
Goose.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.990
That seems like an unnecessarily
complicated cover story.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.960
Yes, but aren't those
the best kind?

19:55.962 --> 19:58.896
I think we have plenty here

19:58.898 --> 20:00.231
To go to the police.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.667
Let's see how innocent
chanel #3 looks

20:02.669 --> 20:04.135
When they start to dig a little.

20:04.137 --> 20:05.069
Hold the phone, dean munsch.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.971
I'd like to play, too.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.339
And the person I think it is

20:08.341 --> 20:10.141
Is you.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.243
(door closes)

20:12.245 --> 20:13.978
Chanel:
<i>Hello, mother, it's me.</i>

20:13.980 --> 20:15.746
Chanel oberlin!

20:15.748 --> 20:17.248
Your daughter?

20:17.250 --> 20:18.816
What, are you drunk?

20:18.818 --> 20:22.653
Okay, drunk on wine
is still drunk, mother.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.922
You know what, never mind.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.758
You know, the one time I call
you for a little advice,

20:27.760 --> 20:30.995
You're hammered.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.297
Happy thanksgiving, mom.

20:38.938 --> 20:42.773
I suppose we should discuss
the matter of payment.

20:42.775 --> 20:43.908
What are you talking about?

20:43.910 --> 20:46.344
I'm asking you
to name your price.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.745
My price?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.914
Are you propositioning me?

20:49.916 --> 20:52.116
No, I'm asking
how much money it'll take

20:52.118 --> 20:54.452
To make you go away.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.853
You seem to be unaware, sir,

20:55.855 --> 20:57.588
That an oberlin
cannot be bought.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.590
My family is super-gross rich.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.092
(laughs)

21:01.094 --> 21:02.727
Look at how you've
chosen to dress.

21:02.729 --> 21:05.129
That outfit screams
desperation.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.733
You're trash, chanel.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.901
Which means
your family's trash, too.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.404
And I'll tell you one thing
right now, you will never

21:13.406 --> 21:15.439
Get your hands
on the radwell fortune.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.408
I am, however,

21:17.410 --> 21:19.243
Willing to write you a check

21:19.245 --> 21:21.612
For $50,000

21:21.614 --> 21:24.081
If you will leave now
and never come back.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.816
(scoffs)

21:25.818 --> 21:27.084
It's a lot of money
for a family like yours.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.919
They could use it to buy
another olive garden

21:28.921 --> 21:31.422
Or whatever it is they do.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.991
(laughs)

21:36.596 --> 21:39.430
Oh, let me ask you a question.

21:39.432 --> 21:42.099
What is the best part
about thanksgiving?

21:42.101 --> 21:43.768
The leftovers.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.469
What do you do if you can't
wait till the next morning

21:45.471 --> 21:47.071
To eat those leftovers?

21:47.073 --> 21:49.573
You turn those leftovers
into dessert.

21:49.575 --> 21:52.310
What about the pumpkin pie?

21:52.312 --> 21:55.980
Uh, okay, once you've had savory
leftover aspic à la radwell,

21:55.982 --> 21:58.916
You'll never want
pumpkin pie ever again.

21:58.918 --> 22:02.420
Tastes like henry viii
just barfed in my mouth.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.421
Chanel:
Chad!

22:03.423 --> 22:04.588
Your father

22:04.590 --> 22:06.090
Just offered me $50,000

22:06.092 --> 22:07.325
To leave the house
and never come back.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.593
Well, I don't want
to sound like a dick here,

22:09.595 --> 22:12.129
But have you ever considered
maybe you should leave?

22:12.131 --> 22:14.165
I mean, with you and hester
here, this thanksgiving,

22:14.167 --> 22:15.966
It's spiraling out of control.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.435
And later tonight,
we're about to get together

22:17.437 --> 22:18.969
And play pictionary,
and as it stands now,

22:18.971 --> 22:20.838
That game of pictionary
is gonna be super awkward.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.340
You can't be serious.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.508
I am serious, chanel,
and uberconfused.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.943
Hester here,
who is super weird

22:25.945 --> 22:27.712
And an obvious psychopath,

22:27.714 --> 22:28.879
She says she's pregnant.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.047
You said she's not pregnant.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.148
You said she was dead,

22:31.150 --> 22:32.550
She says she's not dead.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.884
I'm kind of inclined
to believe her.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.386
Plus, are you gonna
make, like, a habit

22:35.388 --> 22:36.987
Of just, like,
pushing people down the stairs?

22:36.989 --> 22:38.489
'cause I think we can agree,

22:38.491 --> 22:41.125
Not the most adult form
of conflict resolution, chanel.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.226
(clears throat)

22:42.228 --> 22:43.494
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:43.496 --> 22:45.730
Dessert is served.

22:45.732 --> 22:46.897
Oh.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.566
Mom, dad!

22:48.568 --> 22:50.134
Thad, brad!

22:50.136 --> 22:52.636
I'm trying to get
my aspic on!

22:53.740 --> 22:56.340
Now that I have my snacks,

22:56.342 --> 22:58.576
You may begin with
your clearly desperate attempt

22:58.578 --> 23:00.344
To prove I'm a killer.

23:00.346 --> 23:02.079
Oh, wait.

23:02.081 --> 23:05.249
Weston, would you mind opening
a bottle of red for mama?

23:05.251 --> 23:06.650
(sighs)

23:06.652 --> 23:08.052
Chanel #5:
Hey, all!

23:08.054 --> 23:10.154
I brought some of my famous

23:10.156 --> 23:11.889
Eight-meat stuffing.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.425
It's beef, venison, alligator,
buffalo, rabbit,

23:14.427 --> 23:16.727
Goat, rattlesnake and spam.

23:16.729 --> 23:17.895
I cut all of the meats

23:17.897 --> 23:19.063
Super thin,

23:19.065 --> 23:20.498
So that you're guaranteed

23:20.500 --> 23:21.999
Every meat in every bite.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.267
When'd you get here, chanel #5?

23:23.269 --> 23:24.835
I thought you said

23:24.837 --> 23:26.604
You were leaving forever
or something like that?

23:26.606 --> 23:28.773
She says stuff like that but
never really follows through.

23:28.775 --> 23:31.909
Well, I, um,
I actually did go home,

23:31.911 --> 23:33.511
But apparently my family
forgot to tell me

23:33.513 --> 23:35.780
That they were going
to the maldives this year

23:35.782 --> 23:37.014
For thanksgiving, so...

23:39.085 --> 23:40.284
I'm fine.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.452
Chanel #3:
Sure, whatever.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.254
You came just in time

23:43.256 --> 23:45.589
For me to tell everyone why
I know that dean munsch

23:45.591 --> 23:47.091
Is the killer.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.726
Who is the only person we know

23:48.728 --> 23:50.961
Who has a more clear and obvious
motive for killing kappas

23:50.963 --> 23:52.797
"then" dean munsch?

23:52.799 --> 23:54.565
<i>Than</i> dean munsch.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.433
Than.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.234
Not then-- than.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.469
Have you ever

23:58.471 --> 24:00.237
Even cracked open a book?

24:00.239 --> 24:01.906
Or attended a class?

24:01.908 --> 24:04.074
(chuckles)
god.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.276
I hate you people.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.977
Exactly. You hate sororities

24:06.979 --> 24:08.446
And you hate kappa kappa tau,

24:08.448 --> 24:09.914
And when you couldn't
just kick us off campus,

24:09.916 --> 24:11.749
You made sure no one pledged
but losers,

24:11.751 --> 24:13.918
And<i> then</i> started removing us
from school

24:13.920 --> 24:17.087
The only way you could: Murder.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.156
She has a point, dean munsch.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.491
You were there that night

24:20.493 --> 24:22.126
In kappa 20 years ago,

24:22.128 --> 24:23.494
And no one knows what happened

24:23.496 --> 24:25.095
To the babies.

24:25.097 --> 24:27.131
It makes sense
that you could have taken them

24:27.133 --> 24:28.766
And raised them
as your killer pawns

24:28.768 --> 24:30.634
In service of getting revenge
on a place

24:30.636 --> 24:32.903
That you consider to be evil.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.405
Really, that's quite a reach.

24:34.407 --> 24:35.739
Not really.

24:35.741 --> 24:36.907
You did say

24:36.909 --> 24:37.908
Just the other day

24:37.910 --> 24:39.109
That the only way to live

24:39.111 --> 24:40.644
Is to play the long game.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.413
Spending 20 years plotting
for payback

24:42.415 --> 24:44.482
On a crime you consider
to be horrible

24:44.484 --> 24:46.317
Is exactly the kind of thing

24:46.319 --> 24:47.918
That you would do.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.286
And of course you would wait

24:49.288 --> 24:51.155
Until the daughter
of the ringleader of that crime

24:51.157 --> 24:52.957
Arrived on campus.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.592
I really hope

24:54.594 --> 24:57.094
You can come up
with something better than that.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.796
Oh, I can.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.764
I can prove that you're
the only person in this room

25:00.766 --> 25:02.433
We know for a fact
is a murderer.

25:02.435 --> 25:04.468
<i>I saw you in the coffee shop</i>
<i>the other day,</i>

25:04.470 --> 25:07.338
<i>Reading one</i>
<i>of your old</i> playgirl<i> magazines.</i>

25:07.340 --> 25:08.639
I didn't look that closely,

25:08.641 --> 25:10.474
But what I did see
was your meal.

25:10.476 --> 25:11.942
<i>Baked lays,</i>

25:11.944 --> 25:14.044
<i>A pickle wedge, a blondie,</i>

25:14.046 --> 25:16.213
<i>And a half-eaten</i>
<i>bologna sandwich.</i>

25:16.215 --> 25:17.615
Wait.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.983
You are allergic to bologna.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.384
That's the whole reason
they knew

25:20.386 --> 25:21.952
You didn't kill your ex-husband.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.821
No, you can't be allergic
to bologna

25:23.823 --> 25:25.122
Or any other lunch meat.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.390
People who are allergic
to those things

25:26.392 --> 25:28.125
Are affected by the sulfites
in them,

25:28.127 --> 25:29.627
Which are plentiful

25:29.629 --> 25:31.829
In the spam that's
in my stuffing

25:31.831 --> 25:34.064
That you're eating right now.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.166
And in the red wine
you're washing it down with.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.068
Feel free to call
the police now, dean munsch,

25:38.070 --> 25:40.905
Or I'd be perfectly happy
to do it for you.

25:40.907 --> 25:41.872
Wait.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.079
There's something
I need to say first.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.848
Something that's been...

25:50.850 --> 25:53.217
Eating at me
for the longest time.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.052
Now, I'm not saying

25:55.054 --> 25:56.820
I know who the killer is,

25:56.822 --> 25:59.390
But I just-just want
to talk it through.

25:59.392 --> 26:03.561
What? Dad, who do you
think the killer is?

26:03.563 --> 26:06.830
I'm sorry, gracie,

26:06.832 --> 26:09.833
But I think the killer
might be...

26:09.835 --> 26:11.902
You.

26:26.519 --> 26:28.752
Dad, how could you honestly
think that I'm the killer?

26:28.754 --> 26:30.688
Look, I don't want
you to be, honey.

26:30.690 --> 26:32.756
Okay, look, there's
just some stuff

26:32.758 --> 26:34.425
That doesn't add up.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.226
Look, I've gone through
all the suspects in my mind,

26:36.228 --> 26:37.895
And I can explain away
all my suspicions

26:37.897 --> 26:39.430
For everyone except you.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.065
Can we just talk this out,

26:41.067 --> 26:43.901
So you can help me see
that I'm wrong?

26:43.903 --> 26:45.436
Turkey isn't ready yet.

26:45.438 --> 26:46.236
(scoffs)

26:46.238 --> 26:47.905
Actually,

26:47.907 --> 26:49.573
I kind of think
that she's the killer, too.

26:49.575 --> 26:51.241
I mean, it would fit in
with your whole

26:51.243 --> 26:53.243
Hard worker,
let's find out the truth,

26:53.245 --> 26:56.814
Never take no for an answer,
awful personality.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.916
Do you expect us to believe
that when your dad told you

26:58.918 --> 27:00.284
That your mom died in a fire,

27:00.286 --> 27:01.752
You would just accept it

27:01.754 --> 27:02.953
And move on with your life?

27:02.955 --> 27:04.622
Chanel #3: This does
raise some questions.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.423
You are kind of obsessed
with your mom.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.158
You drone on about it endlessly.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.593
Chanel #5:
You know what I think?

27:09.595 --> 27:11.829
I think you did find out
who your mom was

27:11.831 --> 27:13.631
And that she was awful
and responsible

27:13.633 --> 27:14.965
For kappa's greatest shame,

27:14.967 --> 27:16.900
The death of the girl
in the bathtub.

27:16.902 --> 27:18.302
And that you hated the fact

27:18.304 --> 27:19.803
That the face of kappa's evil

27:19.805 --> 27:21.572
Was this woman who you idolized.

27:21.574 --> 27:23.307
So you swore
to come to wallace

27:23.309 --> 27:25.909
And create an even bigger,
even worse bogeyman

27:25.911 --> 27:27.745
To represent kappa,

27:27.747 --> 27:28.946
The red devil.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.314
Anything to redeem

27:30.316 --> 27:31.982
Your beloved dead mother.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.785
Hmm, makes a lot of sense
that that is your theory,

27:34.787 --> 27:36.120
Number five,
because it's insane.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.588
That makes no sense.

27:37.590 --> 27:39.089
Grace:
Pete?

27:39.091 --> 27:40.958
I thought you were
with your family.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.593
I can't rest when the killer's
still out there,

27:42.595 --> 27:43.961
So I stayed behind
to do some more research.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.596
But how did you know
we were here?

27:45.598 --> 27:47.097
Zayday has been
live-tweeting the whole night,

27:47.099 --> 27:48.999
And I know everything you guys
have been talking about,

27:49.001 --> 27:50.300
And you're all wrong.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.635
I know who the killer is,

27:51.637 --> 27:52.836
And it's not grace.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.038
Hey, get in line, okay?

27:54.974 --> 27:56.273
I'm going first.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.975
Okay, fine, dad, you go first,

27:57.977 --> 27:59.143
Then pete can go.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.811
All right, here's
what I have.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.212
Grace, you were the only pledge

28:02.214 --> 28:03.781
That wasn't buried up
to her neck

28:03.783 --> 28:05.983
The night the deaf taylor swift
was decapitated.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.618
And you know that girl, mandy,

28:07.620 --> 28:09.219
Who was there that night
in the bathtub

28:09.221 --> 28:11.288
And then ended up dead
at zayday's haunted house?

28:11.290 --> 28:12.956
Well, no one knew anything
about her

28:12.958 --> 28:15.225
Or where she was for 20 years.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.894
And then when you saw her
that night,

28:16.896 --> 28:19.797
Well, she ended up stabbed
to death.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.900
Pete was there, too, and he also
wasn't buried with the pledges.

28:22.902 --> 28:23.901
Yes, I know.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.303
Which is why I find this stuff

28:26.305 --> 28:27.571
Just interesting.

28:27.573 --> 28:28.739
But what's worrisome to me

28:28.741 --> 28:29.907
Is that

28:29.909 --> 28:31.408
I checked the calendar to see

28:31.410 --> 28:32.743
Which days you did
your class visit

28:32.745 --> 28:34.011
To wallace last year.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.413
It was March 24 to the 26th.

28:36.415 --> 28:39.049
Wait a minute, March 25,
I know that date.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.884
That's the date
that melanie dorkus,

28:40.886 --> 28:42.052
The former president

28:42.054 --> 28:44.722
Of kappa kappa tau, was
horribly disfigured,

28:44.724 --> 28:47.725
When someone put acid
in her spray tan.

28:47.727 --> 28:49.993
And right before she passed out
from the pain,

28:49.995 --> 28:53.163
She said that she saw someone
in a red devil costume

28:53.165 --> 28:54.398
Standing over her.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.000
Wait, we saw you there
that day.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.169
Oh, I remember now.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.071
Chanel:
No, please don't do this to me.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.906
Don't you want me
to spray-tan you?

29:02.908 --> 29:03.907
I have it all ready.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.076
Melanie: No, chanel,
I would honestly

29:06.078 --> 29:07.177
Rather not have you around.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.246
(door slams)

29:17.590 --> 29:19.623
Chanel #5: Who are you
and what are you doing here?

29:19.625 --> 29:21.391
Hi.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.293
Wow, are you guys
sisters here?

29:23.295 --> 29:24.895
That is so cool.

29:24.897 --> 29:25.929
I'm an incoming freshman,

29:25.931 --> 29:27.765
And I was just
checking out the campus,

29:27.767 --> 29:29.266
And I was desperate to see
the inside of this place.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.235
I'm hoping to pledge
when I matriculate.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.903
You're skinny and pretty,
so that's a plus,

29:32.905 --> 29:35.572
But it's highly competitive,
so you'd better be rich, too.

29:35.574 --> 29:36.907
Then you guys kicked me out.

29:36.909 --> 29:38.642
Yeah.
Good times.

29:38.644 --> 29:39.943
Wes:
There is one other thing.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.112
You know how
at the beginning of the year,

29:42.114 --> 29:43.914
I was always
secretly following you

29:43.916 --> 29:45.415
So I could just keep
an eye on you,

29:45.417 --> 29:46.483
Make sure you were safe?

29:46.485 --> 29:48.085
#stalker.

29:48.087 --> 29:51.288
Well, one night
I was #being a good father,

29:51.290 --> 29:53.056
And I was looking out for you.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.928
<i>I heard you talking</i>
<i>to someone,</i>

29:57.930 --> 30:00.164
<i>But I couldn't hear</i>
<i>what it was about.</i>

30:00.166 --> 30:03.066
<i>And when I peeked</i>
<i>around that wall,</i>

30:03.068 --> 30:05.903
<i>I almost fainted</i>
<i>from what I saw.</i>

30:05.905 --> 30:08.572
Oh, no, dad, that was pete.
Yeah, that was me.

30:08.574 --> 30:09.940
What?

30:09.942 --> 30:12.075
Okay, we had plans
to hand out flyers

30:12.077 --> 30:13.110
To see if anyone had

30:13.112 --> 30:14.478
Any information
about the red devil,

30:14.480 --> 30:15.913
And since pete already
had the costume,

30:15.915 --> 30:16.947
We thought it would
be a good idea

30:16.949 --> 30:18.782
For people to see
what he looked like.

30:18.784 --> 30:19.950
Yeah, but we didn't
carry through with the plan.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.586
Oh, thick as thieves, you two.

30:22.588 --> 30:23.987
It's amazing

30:23.989 --> 30:25.455
How he's grace's alibi

30:25.457 --> 30:26.657
For so many of the
horrible murders.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.926
Okay, I-I am now convinced

30:28.928 --> 30:30.761
That the murderer is not

30:30.763 --> 30:31.962
Nut bag #3

30:31.964 --> 30:34.164
But is indeed grace.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.966
No, I am not.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.434
No, no, she's not.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.937
And now I'm sure of it.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.139
Thank you for letting me
talk about this,

30:42.141 --> 30:44.141
Talk this out, and hear
your side of the story.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.043
I'm so relieved.
Don't talk to me.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.878
Of course she's not the killer,
mr. Gardner,

30:47.880 --> 30:50.647
And look, I know this
is kind of awkward,

30:50.649 --> 30:52.049
Because I am dating
your daughter,

30:52.051 --> 30:53.550
And I would really love

30:53.552 --> 30:55.052
To get your approval on this,

30:55.054 --> 30:57.955
But you, sir,
are the red devil killer.

31:00.659 --> 31:01.992
Chanel, hester,

31:01.994 --> 31:03.460
I'm really sorry
about this.

31:03.462 --> 31:04.962
I personally don't think
these teams are fair,

31:04.964 --> 31:06.396
But honestly,
I did warn you,

31:06.398 --> 31:08.665
So if this gets super awkward,
it's on you.

31:08.667 --> 31:09.800
Good luck.

31:09.802 --> 31:10.968
When next we speak,

31:10.970 --> 31:13.036
It will be as adversaries.

31:15.074 --> 31:18.575
Well, just a quick overview
of the rules.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.077
You pick a card

31:20.079 --> 31:21.411
And then you draw the word
on the board

31:21.413 --> 31:22.679
Using little pictures.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.882
No talking or gesturing,

31:24.884 --> 31:27.751
And your team has to guess it
before the time runs out.

31:27.753 --> 31:29.920
Brad, why don't you
start us off?

31:29.922 --> 31:31.321
Come on, brad!
Come on, brad!

31:31.323 --> 31:32.823
(cheering, whooping)

31:32.825 --> 31:35.058
Brad! Brad! Brad!
Brad! Brad! Brad! Brad!

31:35.060 --> 31:36.293
Come on!
You can do this!

31:37.596 --> 31:40.063
(whooping continues)

31:47.406 --> 31:48.405
And...

31:48.407 --> 31:50.073
Go.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.576
Chad: Uh...

31:52.578 --> 31:53.410
Hester.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.945
Um, homely, ugly.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.580
Gold digger! Not welcome.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.682
Oh, unattractive
short person.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.084
Poo belly.
Is it poo belly?

32:01.086 --> 32:02.853
I thought you couldn't gesture?

32:02.855 --> 32:04.421
He wasn't gesturing,
he was pointing.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.924
Uh, doesn't belong here.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.258
Should have left hours ago.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.461
Um, uh, bird. Turkey.

32:11.463 --> 32:12.896
Bunny:
Turkey neck! Neck waddle.

32:12.898 --> 32:14.631
Uh, girl

32:14.633 --> 32:15.465
With a weird, big neck.

32:15.467 --> 32:16.600
Chad: Oh, no, um, uh,

32:16.602 --> 32:18.101
Neck brace! Neck brace!

32:18.103 --> 32:20.070
Ah!
Yes!

32:20.072 --> 32:21.071
Tad:
Second word, second word.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.106
Bunny:
Sounds like...

32:23.108 --> 32:24.241
That's a gesture.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.410
That is a gesture.
Oh, shh.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.078
Chad:
Bed, bed, uh, bed, bed.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.246
Sounds like bed, uh, sleep.

32:29.248 --> 32:30.447
Uh, dead!

32:30.449 --> 32:31.581
Dead neck brace girl.

32:31.583 --> 32:32.916
Overfed!

32:32.918 --> 32:35.118
Overfed girl with a neck brace.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.287
No, no, too chunky
to wear that outfit.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.088
Chad: Uh, uh...

32:38.090 --> 32:38.922
Yeah?

32:38.924 --> 32:39.656
No, no.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.091
Sleeping.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.092
Uh, snore.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.260
Snore, uh, uh,

32:43.262 --> 32:44.127
Um, um,

32:44.129 --> 32:45.495
Whore!

32:45.497 --> 32:46.897
Neck brace whore!

32:46.899 --> 32:48.131
(cheering)

32:50.903 --> 32:52.135
Neck brace whore!

32:54.807 --> 32:56.907
I'm sorry,
but someone needs to contact

32:56.909 --> 32:59.743
The good people at hasbro,
because the odds of you picking

32:59.745 --> 33:00.911
Neck brace whore

33:00.913 --> 33:02.079
Are astronomical.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.814
I'm fairly certain

33:03.816 --> 33:05.749
This board game's
been tampered with.

33:05.751 --> 33:06.917
Chanel, I don't want to be,
like, a rules stickler,

33:06.919 --> 33:08.251
But teams are not really

33:08.253 --> 33:09.920
Supposed to be conversing
between rounds.

33:09.922 --> 33:12.089
You will not shut me up
this time, chad.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.056
I have something to say.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.993
Hester,

33:15.995 --> 33:17.294
I owe you an apology.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.596
Yes, I did push
you down the stairs

33:19.598 --> 33:22.499
In an attempt to murder you
and your fake unborn baby.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.834
And while my motivations

33:23.836 --> 33:25.635
Were airtight and my
conscience clear,

33:25.637 --> 33:27.637
Still, I'm sorry.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.273
You, chanel #6, are my sister,

33:30.275 --> 33:31.942
And that bond is stronger

33:31.944 --> 33:33.944
Than some silly little
attempt on your life.

33:33.946 --> 33:35.779
Thank you.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.881
And furthermore,
I'm sorry that you had to sit

33:37.883 --> 33:40.984
Through the most
mean-spirited game of pictionary

33:40.986 --> 33:42.953
In the history of pictionary.

33:42.955 --> 33:44.888
I mean, no one deserves
to be spoken to like that,

33:44.890 --> 33:47.491
Particularly not by what is,
without a doubt,

33:47.493 --> 33:49.726
The most awful family
in america.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.128
Chad,

33:51.130 --> 33:53.296
Your leathery excuse
for a mother

33:53.298 --> 33:55.966
Looks like an ostrich-hide
clutch from last season

33:55.968 --> 33:57.401
That somehow learned to talk.

33:57.403 --> 33:58.969
And, mr. Radwell,

33:58.971 --> 34:01.405
I have never seen anyone
spend so much money

34:01.407 --> 34:03.240
To make a house look this tacky.

34:03.242 --> 34:06.009
I've honestly seen more
tasteful decor at a sizzler.

34:06.011 --> 34:08.078
And you, thad,

34:08.080 --> 34:09.579
Have a bright future
ahead of you

34:09.581 --> 34:12.149
In the sex offender wing
of a supermax prison.

34:12.151 --> 34:13.984
And you, sir,

34:13.986 --> 34:15.485
Give the kind,

34:15.487 --> 34:17.054
Hard-working,
deeply moral people

34:17.056 --> 34:18.655
Who work in such
a wonderful industry

34:18.657 --> 34:20.123
As hollywood a bad name.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.659
And, chad radwell,

34:22.661 --> 34:24.428
Whatever we had between us

34:24.430 --> 34:26.063
Is over.

34:26.065 --> 34:27.731
I am walking out that door

34:27.733 --> 34:29.599
And never speaking to you again.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.902
You know you say that
a lot, right?

34:31.904 --> 34:34.071
Well, consider this
coming to my senses,

34:34.073 --> 34:35.906
Because no woman
in her right mind

34:35.908 --> 34:38.141
Would want anything to do
with this family.

34:39.244 --> 34:40.977
So good-bye, chad.
Good-bye forever.

34:45.017 --> 34:46.917
Chanel, wait.

34:46.919 --> 34:48.485
I'm coming with you.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.587
Really?
Yes, yes, yes,

34:50.589 --> 34:51.788
All I've ever wanted

34:51.790 --> 34:52.956
Is to be your sister.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.057
Fine.

34:54.059 --> 34:56.126
Let's hit the road, number six.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.627
We're going home.

35:04.736 --> 35:05.969
Tiburon looks good. Just another
ten minutes or so, I think.

35:05.971 --> 35:06.903
What'd I miss?

35:06.905 --> 35:07.938
Pete was just about to ruin

35:07.940 --> 35:09.739
Any chances of marrying grace

35:09.741 --> 35:11.074
By explaining why he thinks
her dad is the killer.

35:11.076 --> 35:12.142
Pete:
Grace,

35:12.144 --> 35:13.910
This is really hard for me,

35:13.912 --> 35:15.745
But I'm
an investigative journalist.

35:15.747 --> 35:16.913
So, like everyone else,

35:16.915 --> 35:18.315
I started with a motive.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.983
Yours was easy, sir,
'cause you just

35:19.985 --> 35:21.985
Keep on repeating it
over and over again.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.587
More than anything,
you want to keep grace safe,

35:23.589 --> 35:25.322
And as far as you're concerned,
the most dangerous thing

35:25.324 --> 35:28.258
In her life is kappa kappa tau.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.460
Now, you begged her
not to join,

35:30.462 --> 35:32.429
But she didn't listen,

35:32.431 --> 35:33.930
So you had to find
another way

35:33.932 --> 35:35.565
To keep her
from becoming a sister,

35:35.567 --> 35:39.236
And what was the best way
to do that? Hmm.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.905
To get dean munsch
to shut down the house.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.073
And so you started
killing sisters

35:43.075 --> 35:44.107
Left and right
until she did,

35:44.109 --> 35:46.409
But... You didn't count
on the small fact

35:46.411 --> 35:48.445
That dean munsch over here
is such a coldhearted bitch.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.312
(chuckling)

35:49.314 --> 35:50.313
Sorry I'm not sorry.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.581
And the body count

35:51.583 --> 35:52.916
Just kept rising and rising

35:52.918 --> 35:55.118
Until you finally got her
to surrender

35:55.120 --> 35:56.920
And shut the place down.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.922
But I could have just
pulled her out of school

35:58.924 --> 36:01.258
Or, hell,
even burned the house down

36:01.260 --> 36:03.460
Before I would even
consider killing people.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.095
Well, you certainly had
the inside information

36:05.097 --> 36:06.596
To pull it off,

36:06.598 --> 36:09.099
At least when it came
to roger and sam.

36:09.101 --> 36:12.102
<i>See, uh, I was looking over</i>
<i>some of kappa's yearbooks</i>

36:12.104 --> 36:13.970
<i>From the time</i>
<i>of the bathtub incident,</i>

36:13.972 --> 36:17.207
<i>And I came across something</i>
<i>both interesting</i>

36:17.209 --> 36:18.875
<i>And deeply disturbing.</i>

36:18.877 --> 36:20.877
Your freshman year, mr. Gardner,

36:20.879 --> 36:21.945
Kappa had

36:21.947 --> 36:23.713
A special night called

36:23.715 --> 36:25.448
The secret kappa tunnel rager,

36:25.450 --> 36:28.385
In which they brought down kegs
into the secret kappa tunnels

36:28.387 --> 36:30.120
And they did a huge party.

36:30.122 --> 36:32.722
Well, there's pictures
from that night and the party.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.658
Please take a look
at who was there.

36:34.660 --> 36:35.825
(gasps)

36:35.827 --> 36:37.394
Oh, wow.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.962
How could such a stud

36:38.964 --> 36:40.564
Evolve from a boy

36:40.566 --> 36:42.132
Who was so clearly a douche.

36:42.134 --> 36:44.067
So you're saying
if he knew about the tunnel,

36:44.069 --> 36:45.235
Then he could've snuck
into the house

36:45.237 --> 36:46.970
The night
we were all locked in.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.838
Yeah.

36:48.840 --> 36:52.576
Oh, please, look,
I-I was so bombed at that party.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.411
I mean, I remember I puked

36:54.413 --> 36:55.812
While I was making out

36:55.814 --> 36:56.913
With some girl,
but there is no way

36:56.915 --> 36:58.148
That I could've found my way

36:58.150 --> 36:59.649
Back down there

36:59.651 --> 37:01.451
20 minutes later,
let alone 20 years.

37:02.821 --> 37:03.887
That wasn't enough
for me, either.

37:03.889 --> 37:04.888
So I kept on digging.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.056
See, I couldn't

37:06.058 --> 37:07.657
Figure out how the bodies

37:07.659 --> 37:08.725
In the meat locker

37:08.727 --> 37:10.227
Just kept disappearing.

37:10.229 --> 37:12.495
So I tapped
into the secret cameras

37:12.497 --> 37:14.264
Chanel had installed
all over the house.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.999
<i>And you, sir,</i>

37:16.001 --> 37:18.301
<i>Are in the footage.</i>

37:20.105 --> 37:21.571
Grace:
Dad,

37:21.573 --> 37:23.273
Why would you do that?

37:23.275 --> 37:26.076
This is really embarrassing,

37:26.078 --> 37:28.111
Um, but I started
the paleo diet,

37:28.113 --> 37:29.913
Because I'm back
on the dating scene now,

37:29.915 --> 37:32.082
And I-I wanted to
lose some weight.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.917
But I'm on a teacher's salary,
and I can't afford meat,

37:33.919 --> 37:35.085
And that freezer,

37:35.087 --> 37:36.086
It's got chicken,

37:36.088 --> 37:37.220
Burgers, ribs,

37:37.222 --> 37:38.888
There's whole sides of beef

37:38.890 --> 37:40.724
Just hanging on hooks,
and you girls don't even eat.

37:40.726 --> 37:41.925
So I figured I'd
just make sure

37:41.927 --> 37:43.226
That none of it went to waste.

37:43.228 --> 37:46.396
<i>So yes, I borrowed some meat.</i>

37:46.398 --> 37:48.064
I'll return it.

37:48.066 --> 37:51.568
<i>I never saw a body</i>
<i>down there.</i>

37:51.570 --> 37:53.603
I actually have noticed
you leaning out a bit.

37:53.605 --> 37:54.871
You look good.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.073
Paleo diet. It works.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.074
Paleo.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.075
None of that

37:59.077 --> 38:00.410
Prepared me

38:00.412 --> 38:02.078
For what I discovered next.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.480
See, uh,

38:03.482 --> 38:04.981
I'm buddies
with the county coroner.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.583
Him and my brother used to sell

38:06.585 --> 38:08.118
Illegal fireworks
in high school.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.419
I bribed him with
a bag of weed

38:09.421 --> 38:11.821
To get some of boone's hair.

38:12.758 --> 38:13.923
This is the part

38:13.925 --> 38:15.125
I'm kind of ashamed of.

38:15.127 --> 38:16.960
Munsch:
Wait a minute, there's a part

38:16.962 --> 38:18.728
Other than bribing a
government official with drugs

38:18.730 --> 38:20.764
So that you can steal
the hair of a dead man

38:20.766 --> 38:22.065
That you're ashamed of?

38:22.067 --> 38:23.733
Well, I-I kind of

38:23.735 --> 38:25.302
Snuck into
mr. Gardner's apartment

38:25.304 --> 38:27.804
To get some hair
from his brush,

38:27.806 --> 38:29.072
And I have a friend

38:29.074 --> 38:30.240
Who works at<i> the maury show,</i>

38:30.242 --> 38:32.309
And I got him to run
a quickie dna test,

38:32.311 --> 38:33.643
And...

38:34.946 --> 38:36.913
I'm sorry to say, mr. Gardner,

38:36.915 --> 38:39.916
But you are the father.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.318
Grace:
What? I'm-I'm sorry.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.987
My dad is boone's father?

38:43.989 --> 38:45.755
Oh, my god.
Dad?

38:45.757 --> 38:47.424
Honey, grace, I swear I had...

38:47.426 --> 38:48.625
I had no idea.

38:48.627 --> 38:49.826
I mean,

38:49.828 --> 38:51.161
It's not out of the question.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.263
I-I was a bit of a man slut
back in the day,

38:53.265 --> 38:54.998
And it was the '90s,
so nobody wore condoms.

38:55.000 --> 38:55.965
(scoffs) trust me.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.267
(whimpers)

38:57.269 --> 38:58.968
Which probably means

38:58.970 --> 39:01.204
You're also the father of
the other baby in the bathtub.

39:01.206 --> 39:02.872
I'm sorry, mr. Gardner,

39:02.874 --> 39:05.542
But this is what they call
an orgy of evidence.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.279
I'm obligated to take it
to the police.

39:10.215 --> 39:11.548
Oh, my god.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.302
I didn't know.

39:32.304 --> 39:34.571
I swear.

39:34.573 --> 39:37.073
And if I had,
I would've taken responsibility.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.743
Of course you would have.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.411
(sighs)

39:41.413 --> 39:43.580
Pete's not gonna call
the police.

39:43.582 --> 39:44.914
I told him that
you're my dad

39:44.916 --> 39:48.051
And I know you.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.053
I mean, those are my kids
out there,

39:50.055 --> 39:51.388
Killing all those people.

39:51.390 --> 39:53.056
Which is why we,
more than anyone,

39:53.058 --> 39:56.059
Have to do everything we can
to find them and stop them.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.828
You think you could do it
in the moment? Hmm?

39:59.931 --> 40:01.398
Send your brother or your sister

40:01.400 --> 40:02.899
Off to the chair?

40:02.901 --> 40:04.401
Maybe even kill them yourself?

40:04.403 --> 40:07.170
To save my friends or you,

40:07.172 --> 40:08.805
Yes.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.075
They are my blood,

40:12.077 --> 40:14.744
But you and zayday
and even the chanels,

40:14.746 --> 40:16.246
All of the people

40:16.248 --> 40:18.248
Who I have suffered
through all of this with,

40:18.250 --> 40:21.017
You are my family.

40:21.019 --> 40:22.719
A highly dysfunctional family,

40:22.721 --> 40:26.122
But... Still.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.390
(chuckles)

40:27.392 --> 40:29.492
Come here.

40:30.729 --> 40:33.129
(sighs)

40:33.131 --> 40:35.064
(sighs)

40:35.066 --> 40:36.900
What about everyone else?

40:36.902 --> 40:38.802
I mean, there are some pretty
compelling cases being made

40:38.804 --> 40:40.570
That someone down there
is the killer.

40:40.572 --> 40:43.973
Which is why no one is going
to the police about any of it.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.576
And all tonight did was
prove that at this point,

40:46.578 --> 40:48.077
It could be anyone,

40:48.079 --> 40:49.479
Except you and me, of course.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.448
Oh, no, totally, totally.
Yeah.

40:51.450 --> 40:53.283
Five minutes to turkey time.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.418
I just checked
the timer personally.

40:55.420 --> 40:57.086
Good.

40:57.088 --> 41:00.089
And then chad's dad
offered me $50,000

41:00.091 --> 41:01.758
To leave and
never come back.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.092
That's amazing.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.260
What are you gonna do
with the money?

41:04.262 --> 41:06.262
I didn't take
the money, idiot.

41:06.264 --> 41:07.931
Um, okay, well,

41:07.933 --> 41:09.766
You already left,
so, basically,

41:09.768 --> 41:11.901
You're out $50,000
for no reason.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.904
Chanel #3 and I
are thrilled to announce

41:14.906 --> 41:17.073
That tiburon is ready
to be served.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.642
Uh, chanel,
would you at least

41:19.644 --> 41:22.278
Please give the illusion
of trying to help?

41:22.280 --> 41:23.913
Okay, first of all,
I experienced

41:23.915 --> 41:26.316
Extreme emotional trauma
this evening,

41:26.318 --> 41:27.484
And second,

41:27.486 --> 41:28.751
I'm the one delegating tasks,

41:28.753 --> 41:30.487
Thank you very much.

41:30.489 --> 41:32.088
It's the most
important job there is.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.990
Plus, I'm saving my energy

41:33.992 --> 41:35.925
For black Friday doorbusters
tomorrow morning.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.427
Um, ladies,
excuse me, please.

41:37.429 --> 41:39.429
I'm gonna go freshen up.

41:39.431 --> 41:41.764
What took you so long?

41:41.766 --> 41:43.600
I couldn't find any matches.

41:43.602 --> 41:45.268
I thought there'd be some
in jennifer's room,

41:45.270 --> 41:47.871
But I ended up finding this
in the downstairs bathroom.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.706
And what happened to you?

41:49.708 --> 41:51.207
I was sharpening this knife.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.876
I couldn't find
ms. Bean's carver,

41:52.878 --> 41:54.043
But this one is
definitely sharp enough

41:54.045 --> 41:56.212
To glide easily
through roasted flesh.

41:56.214 --> 41:58.381
What a weird way to put that.

41:58.383 --> 42:00.049
Chanel:
Oh, great, it's you two.

42:00.051 --> 42:01.951
You're gonna make
fabulous dinner guests

42:01.953 --> 42:02.952
Now that you found out

42:02.954 --> 42:04.220
You fathered
a bastard murderer,

42:04.222 --> 42:05.822
Who's your sibling.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.323
As you can imagine,

42:07.325 --> 42:09.225
It's been sort of
a heavy day for me.

42:09.227 --> 42:10.627
So if you wouldn't mind,

42:10.629 --> 42:12.662
I would love for us all
to have a quiet,

42:12.664 --> 42:14.898
Uneventful thanksgiving.
Thank you.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.566
(sighs)

42:16.568 --> 42:18.468
Come on, let's
bring in tiburon.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.404
Oh, weston,

42:21.406 --> 42:22.839
Is your crazy
girlfriend attending?

42:22.841 --> 42:25.008
Because if so, I need to
set a place for her.

42:25.010 --> 42:28.144
No, no, because I have no idea
where gigi is.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.380
(gasps)

42:30.382 --> 42:32.415
Chad?

42:32.417 --> 42:33.917
You haven't eaten yet, have you?
I knew it!

42:33.919 --> 42:35.885
You've come back.
You've chosen me

42:35.887 --> 42:37.387
Over your awful family.

42:37.389 --> 42:39.822
Hold up.

42:39.824 --> 42:41.991
First of all, my family
is awesome. How dare you?

42:41.993 --> 42:44.394
And second, yeah, I did come
back, but it's only because

42:44.396 --> 42:46.062
I knew you'd have turkey here,

42:46.064 --> 42:47.297
So I thought I'd get
my turkey on with you.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.499
I'm sorry I said that.

42:53.338 --> 42:55.071
What's up, guys?

42:57.242 --> 42:58.608
You know,
I really thought this bird

42:58.610 --> 43:00.410
Would be a lot heavier.

43:00.412 --> 43:03.079
Dean munsch, you must have
really overcooked the turkey.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.080
(scoffs)
oh, that's nonsense.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.583
Tiburon is perfectly cooked.

43:06.585 --> 43:08.284
Okay, I hope everyone's hungry

43:08.286 --> 43:11.621
Because I, for one,
am overjoyed at this.

43:11.623 --> 43:14.223
I mean, look, it's our
first kappa thanksgiving.

43:14.225 --> 43:16.225
So, without further ado,

43:16.227 --> 43:18.861
Dinner is served.

43:20.298 --> 43:22.065
(screaming)

43:28.073 --> 43:30.506
