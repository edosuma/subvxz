you're a werewolf.

00:22.597 --> 00:25.892

you ever hear of a coincidence?

00:25.934 --> 00:27.977
Are you sure it wasn't you?

00:29.979 --> 00:32.941
You could try to contain
your disappointment.

00:32.982 --> 00:35.651

parties and stuff.

Vince.

01:14.816 --> 01:16.818

for my mom.

She denies it,
but she's so full of shit.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.989

over the hill I gotta see.

02:05.158 --> 02:09.912
- I'm a night owl.
- What the hell are you doing here?

02:09.954 --> 02:11.873
Am I disturbing anyone,
officer?

02:11.914 --> 02:13.875

a dead girl's murder site?

02:13.916 --> 02:20.006

- It's that punk gypsy. - Now,

birdies possibly be hatching

02:22.258 --> 02:25.094

look upon favorably?

02:25.136 --> 02:28.014
- We were having a conversation.
- About what?

02:28.056 --> 02:31.017
- The mysteries of mortality.
- OK, come on, let's go.

02:31.059 --> 02:33.686

a pain in the balls.

his old lady's gonna be

02:42.070 --> 02:44.531

one iota less mystifying.

10:41.550 --> 10:44.928
Has it occurred to you
she might be

10:44.970 --> 10:46.930
reluctant to share
with her father

10:46.972 --> 10:50.684
- the specific circumstances
of the fornication? - Reluctant.

10:50.725 --> 10:53.770
Uh, no. Not reluctant.

10:53.812 --> 10:55.897
She says...
(He coughs.)

10:55.939 --> 10:59.360
...she's still a virgin.
She says...

10:59.401 --> 11:02.696
it was an angel.
She said it visited her

11:02.737 --> 11:05.157
this summer and she didn't say
anything at the time

11:05.199 --> 11:07.535
'cause she didn't want us
getting all bent out of shape--

11:07.576 --> 11:10.245
her words--um, but she felt
the time had come

11:10.287 --> 11:14.749
that she needed our help
with the... child.

11:14.791 --> 11:18.920
And she took a pregnancy test, so
she's not hallucinating that part.

11:18.962 --> 11:21.423
- Has she got a boyfriend?
- None lately.

11:21.465 --> 11:24.426
- Been going to church?
- When have you known this family

11:24.468 --> 11:26.595
to go to church
when someone hasn't died?

11:29.181 --> 11:32.184
And what's your professional
evaluation?

11:34.436 --> 11:36.063
Rape.

11:36.104 --> 11:39.483
She was raped,
and her mind bricked it over

11:39.525 --> 11:42.486
with this fantasy. The...

11:42.528 --> 11:46.031
clinical term is
psychogenic amnesia.

11:48.116 --> 11:50.703
Have you contacted the police?

11:50.743 --> 11:53.414
With what?
My suspicion of something

11:53.455 --> 11:56.417
that would've happened in July
that she won't corroborate?

11:56.458 --> 11:58.419
(He sighs.)

11:58.460 --> 12:01.380
At this point, my hope is
to talk her out of keeping it.

12:01.422 --> 12:04.675
Is that for the best?

12:04.717 --> 12:08.429
Oh, as opposed to encouraging
her to carry to term a child

12:08.470 --> 12:13.642
she is convinced is a product
of immaculate conception at...

12:13.684 --> 12:18.647
17, when at any minute the actual
event could come back to her

12:18.689 --> 12:21.483
after an irrevocable decision
has been made.

12:28.865 --> 12:33.828
Now, might I ask, what could
possibly give you the notion

12:33.870 --> 12:37.416
- I have any involvement in this?
- Because...

12:39.418 --> 12:42.379
...I honestly have
no fucking idea

12:42.421 --> 12:46.174
what you would be capable of
if you were afraid of losing me.

13:12.409 --> 13:14.411

13:26.089 --> 13:29.343

13:29.384 --> 13:32.887

13:32.929 --> 13:35.098
I didn't want this to happen.
This was--

13:35.140 --> 13:37.518
- Spiteful.
- Weak.

13:37.559 --> 13:39.894

13:44.483 --> 13:49.029

13:49.070 --> 13:51.198

it was a werewolf.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.870

impressive imaginations.

14:03.794 --> 14:05.920
Still...

14:05.962 --> 14:09.591
it does hold a terribly erotic
sort of appeal,

14:09.633 --> 14:12.052
being hunted down

14:12.093 --> 14:16.097
and devoured by a savage brute.

14:18.726 --> 14:21.729

Homecoming. You goin'?

Ah, I am home.

with a that creep Peter.

19:35.917 --> 19:37.878
(girl): She had
a Tyler moment.

19:37.919 --> 19:40.005
(girl): What do you mean
she had a Tyler moment?

19:40.047 --> 19:42.883
Well, he picked me to play the
mirror game in theatre class,

19:42.924 --> 19:45.135
and... well, I don't know,

19:45.177 --> 19:47.470
- we just... had a moment.
- Pinkalicious.

19:47.512 --> 19:49.263
OK, how do you even know
what a moment is?

19:49.305 --> 19:51.892
I've had a moment before.

19:51.933 --> 19:53.894
Mm-mm, the jet at the pool
doesn't count.

19:53.935 --> 19:56.063
Will you let her tell
her story, you fistula?

19:56.104 --> 19:59.482
So, you're playing
the mirror game.

19:59.524 --> 20:03.111
And he was pretending
to be hitting his golf club,

20:03.153 --> 20:05.613
and he was sticking his butt
way out,

20:05.655 --> 20:08.366
and, I mean, I'm making it sound
really dumb,

20:08.408 --> 20:12.704
but...the way he was doing it,
it was actually really cute,

20:12.746 --> 20:16.124
and... it was definitely
a moment.

20:16.166 --> 20:17.876
I think.

20:17.918 --> 20:20.128
Midnight cherry.

20:20.170 --> 20:24.674
Tyler? Didn't Tyler go out
with Letha Godfrey?

20:24.716 --> 20:27.928
Then he definitely has a type. You know,
she's the only bigger prude than Christina.

20:27.969 --> 20:30.931
- I know. - I know, right?
- I'm not a prude!

20:30.972 --> 20:32.724
This is high school.

20:32.766 --> 20:35.727
- Things are gonna be different.
- Uh-huh.

20:35.769 --> 20:38.230
People can change.
Who says they can't?

20:38.271 --> 20:40.440
- Powder brush.
- Absolutely. It's menses.

20:40.481 --> 20:42.901
- Definitely menses.
- Yes.

20:42.943 --> 20:45.779
- Yeah. - It's not.
- Yeah, it is.

Which one's this?

20:58.458 --> 21:00.752
The Breathe Project.

21:00.794 --> 21:02.963
It's gonna take a lot
of elbow grease

to clean up the air in this town after
what the Godfreys have done to it.

Valentine makes it slutty.

- It's OK.

36:04.488 --> 36:06.406
Today I've seen the dragon.

36:08.617 --> 36:10.536
No, it's OK.

36:12.955 --> 36:14.915
You.

36:14.957 --> 36:17.626
It was you.

36:19.795 --> 36:22.756
I don't want to see that!

36:22.798 --> 36:24.633
I don't want to see that!

36:24.675 --> 36:27.887
I saw that cheerleader!
I saw her get killed!

36:27.928 --> 36:31.182
(shuffling sound outside)

36:39.565 --> 36:43.235
Hey!

36:46.947 --> 36:49.324
(girls laughing)

36:49.366 --> 36:51.326
(car door closing)

36:53.328 --> 36:56.331
(car starting)

37:01.628 --> 37:04.631
(car speeding away)

37:12.139 --> 37:15.142
(thunder rumbling faintly)

37:31.158 --> 37:34.536
(man): <i>A good lover.</i>
<i>That is the secret.</i>

37:34.578 --> 37:38.707
(boy): What's that from?
A bad lover?

37:38.749 --> 37:42.211
You could say that.

37:42.253 --> 37:46.966
- Upir.
- What's that?

37:49.176 --> 37:54.140
They are things that look like
you and me, but they are not.

37:54.181 --> 37:57.517
Clothes, smile, beating heart--

37:57.559 --> 38:02.773
these things are only masks
hiding the creature beneath.

38:04.775 --> 38:07.527
But the eyes, ah,

38:07.569 --> 38:11.740
they show themselves
with the eyes.

38:11.782 --> 38:15.744
There is such... darkness

38:15.786 --> 38:18.413
that it shines.

38:32.803 --> 38:36.389
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:36.431 --> 38:38.684
You do the reading for Pisaro?

38:38.725 --> 38:41.353
Nah, I watched the movie.

38:41.394 --> 38:44.523
You know, I can never keep
the Brontë sisters straight.

38:44.564 --> 38:46.775
Which one do fat goth girls
learn how to masturbate to?

38:46.817 --> 38:48.986
Why do I get the feeling that
half the reason you talk to me

38:49.028 --> 38:51.238
is the way people look at you
when you're talking to me?

38:58.411 --> 39:01.248
Oh, it's more than half.

39:03.250 --> 39:05.585
The thing is, we don't have
the same problem.

39:05.627 --> 39:07.213
Which is?

39:07.254 --> 39:09.756
You're only bored
if you're boring.

39:34.740 --> 39:38.077
Yeah. Supermarkets, you know,
they're good for the big stuff,

39:38.118 --> 39:41.997
feeding the troops, but...
slim on the finer things.

39:42.039 --> 39:47.336
You know, my cousin Vince used
to say that some appetites

39:47.378 --> 39:51.631
require a specialty shop.
And with the big-box stores...

39:54.134 --> 39:57.888
...you know, they're getting
paid, right? Why tip 'em, right?

39:57.930 --> 39:59.932
Call me!

40:02.809 --> 40:05.896
"And the angels were so angry
that they flung me out,

40:05.938 --> 40:08.982
"into the middle of the heath,
on top of Wuthering Heights,

40:09.024 --> 40:11.484
"where I awoke sobbing for joy.

40:11.526 --> 40:14.821
"That will do to explain
my secret, as well as the other.

40:14.863 --> 40:19.076
"I've no more business to marry Edgar
Linton than I have to be in heaven.

40:19.118 --> 40:21.412
So, he shall never know
how I love him--"

40:23.496 --> 40:25.457
Are we passing notes,

40:25.498 --> 40:29.420
- Mr. Godfrey?
- Wouldn't dream of it, ma'am.

40:29.461 --> 40:32.172
" ...as well as the other.

40:32.214 --> 40:37.386
"I've no more business to marry Edgar
Linton than I have to be in heaven.

40:37.428 --> 40:40.722
"And if the wicked man in there had
not brought Heathcliff so low,

40:40.764 --> 40:43.100
"I shouldn't have
thought of it.

40:43.142 --> 40:45.685
"It would degrade me
to marry Heathcliff now,

40:45.727 --> 40:48.772
so he shall never know
how I love him..."

41:16.049 --> 41:20.053
(frogs croaking) (insects chirping)
(Lynda): He's coming where?!

41:20.095 --> 41:22.348
I don't know.
He asked me if he could.

41:22.389 --> 41:25.445
No, no. Look, simple questions
have two possible answers.

41:25.565 --> 41:26.735
I meant to say no.

41:26.643 --> 41:29.480
But I opened up my mouth
and something else came out--

41:29.521 --> 41:32.149
Peter! We've discussed
these people! What the hell--

41:32.191 --> 41:35.152
Lynda, he's the only one in town
that thinks that I didn't do it!

41:35.194 --> 41:37.737
Oh, because he did?

41:39.739 --> 41:41.492
I just...

41:41.533 --> 41:43.494
I have this feeling

41:43.535 --> 41:46.163
that something very important is
about to happen.

41:48.581 --> 41:52.169
I get it. I get it, baby.
I get it.

41:52.211 --> 41:55.005
'Cause you've never had
a friend.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.928
I hope those balls know
what they're doin'.

42:21.281 --> 42:23.658
(knocking on door)

42:31.041 --> 42:32.625
Hey.

42:32.667 --> 42:36.213
Hey.

42:36.255 --> 42:38.424
Come in.

42:38.465 --> 42:40.592
- Hello.
- Hi.

42:40.633 --> 42:44.471
Roman, this is Lynda, my mom.
Lynda, this is Roman.

42:49.476 --> 42:51.337
Are you Hindu or something?

42:51.457 --> 42:54.025
The photo's the grandfather,
and the statue's Ganesh.

42:54.273 --> 42:56.858
That's the god of new
beginnings. But I don't think

42:56.900 --> 42:59.694
Nicolae ever actually
knew that, huh?

43:01.696 --> 43:03.990
He used to call him Jumbo
and ask if what he had

43:04.032 --> 43:06.201
between his legs was anything
like what he had on his nose.

43:06.243 --> 43:08.870
- He was a real class act.
- Sit.

43:08.912 --> 43:10.539
Oh.

43:17.379 --> 43:18.713
Milk?

43:18.755 --> 43:20.340
Sure.

43:20.382 --> 43:21.758
Honey?

43:21.800 --> 43:24.844
- Lactic acid.
- Oh. Right, right, right.

43:24.886 --> 43:27.306
It does funny things
to the tummy.

43:29.308 --> 43:31.684
So, meeting
a friend of Peter's.

43:31.726 --> 43:33.937
A first time for everything.

43:33.979 --> 43:37.274
A very good friend,

43:37.316 --> 43:41.570
I hope. What are your plans
after graduation?

43:41.612 --> 43:45.407
I guess my mom will bribe
my way into somewhere decent.

43:45.449 --> 43:48.535
I see. That's nice.
