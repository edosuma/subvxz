02:47.880 --> 02:52.359
...it's 4:22 p.m. Kigali time
at the studio of RTLM.

02:52.640 --> 02:57.159
Notice to all the cockroaches
listening now...

03:11.800 --> 03:12.800
Anna?

03:17.880 --> 03:18.880
Anna!

03:31.880 --> 03:33.679
What are you doing here?

03:37.160 --> 03:39.239
Shh... Don't move, okay?

03:55.280 --> 03:59.599
Rwanda belongs to those
who really defend her

03:59.960 --> 04:03.079
And you, cockroaches,
are not real Rwandans.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.679
It's our good luck that there are
so few Tutsis in our country.

04:08.040 --> 04:12.079
They are no longer ten per cent,
they are now at eight per cent.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.399
If we exterminate all the cockroaches,
nobody will judge us,

04:16.839 --> 04:20.439
because we will emerge the victors.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.439
Come and rejoice, friends

04:24.680 --> 04:27.239
Cockroaches are no more

04:27.840 --> 04:30.479
God is merciful...

04:32.280 --> 04:35.199
I have visa,
and I'm during the evacuation.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.319
What do you have in the box there?

04:38.280 --> 04:39.679
No, sir, please!

04:40.960 --> 04:42.159
Check here!

04:42.240 --> 04:45.039
You can check, there are only
dead birds, there is nothing.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.279
I want to know why you kill our birds.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.719
- You killed the vultures.
- No, I didn't kill the birds.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.559
You said you have dead birds.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.759
Yes, I have dead birds,
because I found them.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.159
- I'm making research.
- You found them where?

04:57.400 --> 04:59.999
We want the vulture to eat the Tutsi.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.839
And you kill it!

05:02.160 --> 05:03.199
Where is money?

05:03.480 --> 05:05.600
- I can give you a box of cigarettes.
- I'll rape you.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.999
Please, because I don't have any money
and I have to go.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.759
- No.
- Please let me go!

05:09.880 --> 05:12.079
If you don't give me money,
I'm going to rape you.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.400
No!

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
Please!

05:15.680 --> 05:18.159
- No!
- Eat the Tutsi! Eat!

05:18.760 --> 05:20.999
You killed the vulture, now eat him!

07:02.160 --> 07:05.319
I'm a witness, I can testify.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.239
She's from the Tutsi minority.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.439
Due to the current situation in Rwanda,

07:12.120 --> 07:14.559
- she ought to be...
- We'll look into it.

07:17.760 --> 07:18.760
Look...

07:19.600 --> 07:20.879
you have two options.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.480
Yes?

07:23.440 --> 07:25.959
We direct you to a refugee center...

07:26.440 --> 07:28.439
or Ms...

07:29.760 --> 07:31.559
- Keller.
- Keller...

07:33.760 --> 07:36.959
becomes your legal representative
and you stay in her care.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.199
Ms Keller becoming my legal
representative is not an option.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.119
- Claudine...
- Please.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.999
Direct me to a refugee center.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.559
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

07:48.520 --> 07:49.679
What are you doing?

07:50.280 --> 07:52.999
- This might not be your best choice.
- Please!

07:54.400 --> 07:56.159
Direct me to a refugee center.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.440
Don't be stupid.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.159
Why don't you talk to her?

08:05.720 --> 08:08.119
She has no idea
what such a center looks like.

08:13.880 --> 08:14.880
As you wish.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.039
Do you have any luggage?

08:19.640 --> 08:20.640
Just this bag.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.960
Okay.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.639
Here you are.

08:26.920 --> 08:27.999
Follow me, please.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.559
During the past few weeks,
we've all looked on in horror and despair

09:12.760 --> 09:16.679
as violence on a massive scale has erupted
in the African state of Rwanda.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.119
200,000 people are believed
to have died

09:21.440 --> 09:23.919
and up to 2 million
have fled their homes.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.639
Whatever the causes of this terror,

09:26.760 --> 09:31.119
the fact is it's the ordinary people
of Rwanda who are paying the price.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.799
What kind of an idea is that?

11:19.160 --> 11:21.919
I'm sorry.
I cannot accept your resignation.

11:25.840 --> 11:26.999
What about the grant?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.639
I'm done with Africa.

11:33.240 --> 11:37.759
It isn't the only place with vultures.
Move your research to India.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.119
Have you read the latest Scientist?

11:40.240 --> 11:43.159
You're not getting it.
I'm not interested any more.

11:47.600 --> 11:52.399
Why don't you take a sabbatical?
Have some rest. Some therapy perhaps.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.919
Let's get back to it later,
talk it over.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.480
Are you sure?

12:09.200 --> 12:10.959
Now, how was it? Tell me.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.680
Fine.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.879
Have you heard from your daughter?

12:21.880 --> 12:22.880
Yes.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.519
She's suing me for more alimony.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.399
Can you manage, financially speaking?

12:35.200 --> 12:39.199
Yes, I have the grant money.
I'll be fine, don't worry.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.119
Don't be a stranger.
Come by for a cup of coffee.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.280
Thanks.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.520
Bye.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.880
Take care!

13:53.760 --> 13:56.199
I'm not gonna drink with you,
I've told you.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.919
Did something happen?

14:11.600 --> 14:12.759
You want to talk?

14:30.560 --> 14:35.839
They have dark spots, bright spots,
or no spots at all.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.199
And what's their beak like?

14:41.240 --> 14:43.599
- Beak!
- You have a beak!

14:44.480 --> 14:45.279
All right.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.879
This conversation is over.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.519
- Over.
- Okay.

15:09.880 --> 15:10.880
Quit it!

15:11.680 --> 15:13.839
Don't start again.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.479
Please... come on!

15:16.520 --> 15:18.639
Don't start again. Jesus!

15:24.360 --> 15:25.839
I can't, you know.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.599
I've started organizing your archive.

16:57.760 --> 17:02.319
You've collected so much it'll take me
half a year to wade through it.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.079
Everything's fine at the uni.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.439
Danusia sends her regards.

19:49.800 --> 19:53.479
I'm Katarzyna Falska,
from the refugee center. Can we talk?

19:55.840 --> 19:56.840
Come in.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.199
- Did I wake you?
- No, I'm working.

20:02.800 --> 20:07.439
Your testimony says you've been
a longtime friend of the family...

20:07.560 --> 20:11.119
and the only person
she knows in Poland.

20:11.880 --> 20:16.839
She's been granted a refugee status.
She should leave the center.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.039
You want me to take her in?

20:20.120 --> 20:22.319
That would be the best solution.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.279
- No, a terrible solution.
- Why?

20:26.480 --> 20:27.959
Because it's your business.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.239
Your institution
has appropriate means.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.319
If you're so concerned,
take her in yourself.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.999
I have thought about it.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.599
But I can't. I already have
two boys from Chechnya.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.519
Then I don't know how to help you.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.159
Then why did you bring her here?

20:53.360 --> 20:57.119
I did bring her here.
Bought her a ticket, got her a visa.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.399
I've done my part. That's it.

21:00.480 --> 21:03.799
I can't even begin to imagine
what must have happened there.

21:04.240 --> 21:07.199
And I realize it's difficult for you, too.

21:10.400 --> 21:15.919
But it's just another reason why
you're the one person to understand her.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.519
You are the only one that can help her.

21:21.720 --> 21:22.720
No, I'm not.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.239
Last Thursday
Claudine tried to kill herself.

21:28.240 --> 21:32.599
- Well, tough luck. It happens.
- I don't think you really mean that.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.839
I think you should go now.

22:12.840 --> 22:13.840
Hang on.

22:20.560 --> 22:21.959
Give it to her, will you?

22:23.520 --> 22:24.959
That's all the cash I have.

25:49.880 --> 25:50.999
Her name and surname?

25:51.840 --> 25:53.159
Claudine Mugambira.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.359
- It's C-L-A-U-D-l-N-E.
- I know how to spell it.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.439
- Why is he asking my name?
- Sorry?

25:58.560 --> 26:00.079
Why is he asking my name?

26:01.240 --> 26:03.319
- Because he needs it.
- For what?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.759
For your papers, for the work.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.959
Date and place of birth?

26:11.240 --> 26:12.919
Date and place of birth?

26:12.960 --> 26:15.239
- Careful, it's not a toy.
- I'm careful.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.559
Could you answer, please?

26:19.520 --> 26:23.799
1971, 5th August, Butare.

26:24.880 --> 26:25.999
- Got it?
- Of course.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.399
What are you...? Ah, okay.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.639
What did I tell you?

26:36.720 --> 26:38.119
Leave it be, I'll do it.

26:38.720 --> 26:39.720
Education?

26:39.960 --> 26:40.960
Education?

26:43.960 --> 26:44.960
Normale primaire.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.480
What?

26:47.080 --> 26:48.719
Just write, "pedagogy studies."

26:49.280 --> 26:50.959
- I'll leave it be.
- Yeah.

26:55.840 --> 26:56.919
Parents' names?

26:57.480 --> 26:58.639
Jean-Paul...

26:59.120 --> 27:01.119
Claudine, be careful.
It's for mice.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.399
And mom's name?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.359
Could you spell your mom's name?

27:16.640 --> 27:17.640
Claudine?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.079
Mukande Anastaze.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.999
But could you spell it for me, please?

27:29.080 --> 27:31.159
Just leave it blank. There's no point.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.399
Fine, give it here.

27:33.760 --> 27:34.760
Mukan...

27:35.640 --> 27:36.439
Mukan...

27:36.640 --> 27:39.399
Just write "Mukande."
I don't know how to spell it.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.040
Jesus Christ!

27:44.680 --> 27:45.919
What's wrong? Claudine!

27:46.680 --> 27:50.959
- We should take her blood pressure.
- What? Just open the window.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.519
- Shall I get her some pills?
- What pills?

27:54.640 --> 27:56.479
It happens to her every other day.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.159
- Claudine, sit down.
- Just lift her.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.559
And her father, Jean-Paul?

29:30.840 --> 29:31.840
An ornithologist.

29:32.720 --> 29:36.719
We worked together researching
the vulture population in Central Africa.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.119
Fieldwork, mostly.

29:41.840 --> 29:44.359
How long have you known the Mugambiras?

29:45.240 --> 29:46.759
For over three years. I mean...

29:47.720 --> 29:49.119
I knew Jean-Paul best,

29:49.440 --> 29:52.279
but I met all of them.
I lived at their house.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.599
Still, I just cannot see why

29:56.760 --> 30:00.359
Ms Claudine Mugambira
should not return to Rwanda soon.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.999
The situation is stable... enough.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.719
Her ethnic group, the Tutsi,
are in power now.

30:09.080 --> 30:14.479
I believe it is a moral obligation
to grant permanent residence

30:14.560 --> 30:18.439
to a daughter of a Rwandan scientist
murdered during a genocide.

30:19.640 --> 30:24.679
Dr Keller, it's not for you to define
the priorities of the Polish government.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.119
It is not that simple.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.559
One doesn't kill a million people
for no reason.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.639
This is all more complicated
than you think.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.079
I know the reason.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.440
I'm all ears.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.599
Do you know
who set everything up over there?

30:54.280 --> 30:56.519
Little white dicks like you.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.879
Except they studied at the Sorbonne.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.479
FAMILY

33:25.080 --> 33:28.239
It's been a few days now.
She comes in, hangs around,

33:29.440 --> 33:30.959
then disappears for the day.

33:31.680 --> 33:32.680
She does nothing.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.679
I don't blame her.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.359
It's impossible to work in this mess.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.919
She isn't cut out for this job.
She's afraid of animals.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.919
Excuse me,
didn't you know who she was?

33:49.600 --> 33:51.639
Don't you know
what she's gone through?

33:52.840 --> 33:56.039
Who told me she should work here?
It was your idea.

34:00.720 --> 34:04.999
What am I to do with her now?
Her studies won't start until autumn.

34:06.040 --> 34:08.039
Perhaps she should do something else.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.239
Can't she translate or teach a language?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.438
Are you firing her then?

34:14.280 --> 34:16.319
No! I'm just wondering.

34:16.920 --> 34:21.438
Other workers are watching her.
This can't go on, her doing nothing.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.559
Stop smoking in here!

34:23.639 --> 34:24.639
Will you?

34:28.120 --> 34:29.918
I'm just wondering how to help.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.719
Some help! Shove it up your ass!

34:33.320 --> 34:35.918
- Except you are beyond help!
- Quit splashing!

34:36.000 --> 34:39.159
- Beyond help!
- Go help your mom, you idiot!

34:39.239 --> 34:41.719
You and your constant grudge
against the world!

35:03.440 --> 35:07.679
If I borrowed a car from my father,
would you go play tennis with me?

35:07.840 --> 35:12.439
If I borrowed a car from my father,
would you go play tennis with me?

35:13.560 --> 35:15.719
I can't. I'm going to the disco.

35:17.320 --> 35:21.799
If I borrowed a dress from my sister,
would you go to the disco with me?

35:22.000 --> 35:27.159
If I borrowed a dress from my sister,
would you go to the disco with me?

35:28.280 --> 35:30.959
I can't.
I'm going to pick some mushrooms.

35:31.560 --> 35:36.079
If I borrowed oilskins from my brother,
would you go sailing with me?

35:36.600 --> 35:42.119
If I borrowed oilskins from my brother,
would you go sailing with me?

35:43.560 --> 35:45.519
I can't.
I'm going to play tennis.

35:45.640 --> 35:46.640
Fuck you then.

36:35.800 --> 36:36.800
Claudine!

36:43.440 --> 36:45.199
Why are you sitting like that?

36:48.200 --> 36:51.079
The fish, is it from the ponds?
From Witek?

36:54.560 --> 36:55.560
Hey!

36:56.200 --> 36:57.200
What's up?

36:58.240 --> 36:59.479
Why are you sitting...?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
They've found her.

37:02.680 --> 37:03.680
What?

37:05.480 --> 37:06.480
It's freezing...

37:07.560 --> 37:09.119
Marie-Christine, my cousin.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.239
They've found her.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.519
But it's in French.

37:34.200 --> 37:38.079
"We have the honor to inform you that...

37:39.480 --> 37:41.039
Marie-Christine...

37:43.520 --> 37:47.599
is alive and is in diocese of Butare,

37:47.760 --> 37:49.519
Communique Sacre-Coeur, Rwanda.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.959
This is the only information
that we have for now...

37:56.440 --> 37:58.119
but we'll keep you updated.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.399
You can now write to the person."

38:05.120 --> 38:07.159
- So it's good news!
- Yeah.

38:07.800 --> 38:08.800
Very good.

38:15.520 --> 38:16.520
Don't cry!

38:19.040 --> 38:22.119
Give it to me. We will frame it.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.119
- Did you eat anything?
- No.

38:26.920 --> 38:30.959
Why does he keep giving us fish?
Who wants to scale it all again?

38:32.040 --> 38:33.040
What?

38:38.200 --> 38:39.359
Do you want eggs?

38:42.720 --> 38:44.279
Maybe. And bread.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.839
I don't understand what you mean.

39:21.680 --> 39:24.759
I'm telling you
you cannot go to Rwanda...

39:25.200 --> 39:26.959
without Polish residency.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.200
Look.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.719
Or you won't be able to come back.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.919
Wait a second. But...

39:38.240 --> 39:41.439
she's been granted refugee status.
I don't quite understand.

39:43.320 --> 39:46.919
Yes, but she will lose it
once she goes back to Rwanda.

39:47.040 --> 39:50.759
Especially now that Tutsi are in power.
The situation has changed.

39:50.960 --> 39:53.319
She's no longer in danger
of any repressions.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.560
Do you understand?

39:55.640 --> 39:56.640
No.

39:56.920 --> 40:00.919
You'll lose it.
Your refugee status.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.519
Lose it. Automatically.

40:03.840 --> 40:07.879
Wait. So, you mean I will never
be able to go back home again?

40:08.080 --> 40:09.919
No, you have to wait.

40:10.920 --> 40:13.639
Hold on three or four years.

40:16.840 --> 40:21.879
Once you get Polish residency
or a Polish passport,

40:22.560 --> 40:25.439
and you can spend all holidays in Rwanda.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.719
I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.

40:28.760 --> 40:32.319
I'm sorry, but that's the law.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.959
I'm so sorry. It's not my fault.

40:41.160 --> 40:44.759
You cannot come back
to Rwanda now. Really.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.679
I think it's too risky.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.759
And don't worry,
three or four years, it's not...

40:55.840 --> 40:59.399
Stop saying, "three or four years"!
And it's not about holidays!

41:02.760 --> 41:04.839
Okay. It's the only way, I'm sorry.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.559
Maybe she's got AIDS?

42:53.400 --> 42:57.319
No, she hasn't. She got tested
thoroughly on arrival here.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.719
It's obviously psychosomatic.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
I don't know.

43:03.720 --> 43:08.199
From bronchitis to pneumonia,
falling ill over and over again.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.919
I can't just keep stuffing her
with antibiotics.

43:21.400 --> 43:22.400
Anna...

43:25.680 --> 43:26.919
She needs therapy.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.439
I suggested it. She didn't want it.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.639
Besides, who can I send her to?

43:37.160 --> 43:38.479
Marczak, that idiot?

43:39.720 --> 43:41.159
How would they communicate?

43:45.160 --> 43:46.160
Well, obviously...

43:51.280 --> 43:54.519
Marczak's an idiot, I'm an idiot...

43:58.920 --> 44:00.919
You're the know-it-all around here.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.520
No, I'm not.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.679
Do you have any pills for PTSD?

44:12.080 --> 44:14.319
Or shall I put her on psychotropics?

44:20.680 --> 44:22.759
- What about you?
- Me?

44:27.120 --> 44:29.079
The picture of health, aren't you.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.039
Not so much.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.159
But I'm getting by.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.319
If you don't like it, don't come over.

44:48.280 --> 44:49.280
Anna...

44:52.880 --> 44:53.880
You know what?

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Don't call me.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.320
Hello.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.440
Hello.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.999
Is Ms Anna Keller home?

45:30.360 --> 45:31.360
No, she's not.

45:31.760 --> 45:32.959
What is it about?

45:34.840 --> 45:36.799
Could we please see your papers?

45:37.600 --> 45:38.600
Why?

45:39.760 --> 45:41.799
It's just a routine check.

45:42.880 --> 45:43.880
One second.

46:14.920 --> 46:16.679
Claudine... Mo...

46:16.960 --> 46:17.960
Mugambira.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.119
How long have you been here?

46:24.240 --> 46:25.399
Why, what is it?

46:26.040 --> 46:27.199
Nothing, it's just...

46:27.440 --> 46:30.759
I'm just asking.
Are you going to stay long?

46:31.320 --> 46:32.320
Maybe.

46:34.560 --> 46:37.479
Is anyone else coming?

46:39.720 --> 46:40.799
Any family members?

46:42.200 --> 46:43.719
Why do you even ask?

46:45.560 --> 46:47.879
Well, perhaps someone is coming.

46:50.960 --> 46:53.119
They're all fine, my papers.

46:54.400 --> 46:57.919
Come on. The papers are okay.
Our apologies.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.200
False alarm.

47:00.520 --> 47:01.520
An alarm?

47:02.160 --> 47:04.559
Raised by concerned citizens.
Have a nice day.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.239
Best of luck.

47:12.920 --> 47:16.679
I'll call Anna tonight,
I'll learn something.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.719
She's kind of cool, isn't she?

47:21.280 --> 47:23.879
One may be cool,
but if more arrive... who knows.

47:41.960 --> 47:42.960
Claudine?

49:51.680 --> 49:54.879
So you want me to, to what? To praise you?
To write songs about you?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.079
Get out! Get out of the car!

49:57.640 --> 49:59.079
Get out! Get out of the car!

50:00.560 --> 50:01.560
Go!

50:02.840 --> 50:03.840
I will go!

50:04.480 --> 50:07.279
Get out!
And don't come back! Ever!

50:07.360 --> 50:11.239
- I will never come back! I don't need you!
- Close the door!

50:12.120 --> 50:14.239
So what? What?
You also need my...

50:14.920 --> 50:15.679
Here you go.

50:15.840 --> 50:18.079
Everything you gave me.
I don't need you!

50:19.840 --> 50:22.279
I can survive without you!
What else?

50:22.360 --> 50:24.719
You are so smart?
You are so brave?

50:25.320 --> 50:27.599
So take it off!
You are so brave?

50:28.920 --> 50:29.920
I will take it off!

50:30.160 --> 50:32.879
No, because you will wash it!
No, you will wash it.

50:34.480 --> 50:36.439
You are so smart?
You are so nice?

50:38.640 --> 50:40.919
- You want everything?
- Yes, I want everything!

50:41.000 --> 50:42.919
Yes, I want everything back!

50:44.040 --> 50:45.479
I want my life back!

50:47.360 --> 50:48.439
Stupid cow!

52:35.800 --> 52:37.319
I've made up my mind.

52:42.880 --> 52:44.919
I want to go back to Rwanda.

52:46.720 --> 52:51.359
I want to go and try to find their bodies
and give them a proper burial.

52:56.320 --> 52:58.079
I can't keep on running away.

53:00.360 --> 53:01.360
Okay.

53:02.480 --> 53:03.480
I understand.

53:43.480 --> 53:44.480
What's that one?

53:46.440 --> 53:47.440
Bąk.

53:48.960 --> 53:49.960
Bąk.

53:52.200 --> 53:53.359
That's a funny name.

53:58.520 --> 53:59.520
And that one?

54:01.440 --> 54:02.440
Cietrzew.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.240
Cietrzew.

54:06.440 --> 54:07.440
Cietrzew.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.120
Cietrzew.

54:12.440 --> 54:14.159
You can say, Tetrao tetrix.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.559
It's also difficult.

54:25.760 --> 54:26.760
Anna?

54:31.920 --> 54:33.599
Can you finish your research?

54:36.960 --> 54:40.519
So that there is at least something
left after my father?

54:54.040 --> 54:55.119
What's that one?

54:58.360 --> 54:59.399
Podróżniczek.

55:00.200 --> 55:01.639
Podróżniczek.

57:10.040 --> 57:11.599
Isn't this kingfisher cool?

57:12.600 --> 57:16.399
I lay in wait for three months
near Sułowo before I snapped it.

57:22.280 --> 57:25.159
Does your dad know
you want to sell his collection?

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Of course.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.160
Right.

57:30.680 --> 57:32.839
Horst would never sell his archive.

57:34.160 --> 57:35.319
Especially not to me.

57:39.320 --> 57:40.479
It's not for sale.

57:55.560 --> 57:56.560
Look, Anna...

57:57.360 --> 57:58.799
I'm retired now.

58:01.120 --> 58:05.359
You must have some friends left
at the department.

58:07.920 --> 58:10.599
All I have left is rheumatism.

58:14.880 --> 58:18.959
That picture of seagulls.
It's doctored, isn't it?

58:19.200 --> 58:20.479
Oh, come on.

58:22.480 --> 58:23.480
Not bad.

58:23.840 --> 58:25.079
Who's going to notice?

58:26.360 --> 58:30.679
Kids come here. They learn about ecology.

58:34.320 --> 58:36.119
What will remain when we're gone?

58:37.600 --> 58:38.600
Nature will.

59:43.800 --> 59:44.800
I'm sorry.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.239
- Hello?
- Yes?

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.799
- The last ones have no labels.
- It's fine.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440
Okay.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:26.039
These two separately, please.
The gulls and the waders.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.519
- Don't mix them up.
- We won't.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.599
Set them up tight, lads,
so nothing rattles on the way.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.319
- Did you hear me?
- Certainly, sir.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.399
- Is this everything?
- Yes.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.079
Krzyś, fetch me that little white file
from the car, will you?

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.959
A chunk of your father's life, eh?

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:16.560
All of his life.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.520
Thank you.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.280
No, thank you.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.439
I admire you, Anna.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.599
I'd never part with these things.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.319
They're in good hands.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.119
Please take care of them.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.120
Goodbye.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.999
Please give your dad my best.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.319
Mind the bumpy roads, lads.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.839
Don't cry, stupid.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.039
We made a deal of our life.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.600
Thanks, Anna.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.200
Thanks.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.519
All this charity,
it's past the expiry date.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.839
We have to burn everything.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.839
If we don't burn it today, we'll find
everything tomorrow on black market.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.479
Is he HIV-positive?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.199
We have many thousands of cases
like his mother here.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.999
Everyone a victim of rape.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.759
Even of group rape.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.880
Now it's better.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.399
She doesn't spend all day here.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.159
She gets used to the situation.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.279
Wouldn't it be better if...

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.599
Wouldn't it be better
if the boy stayed here with you?

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:08.439
Nobody here has a family.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.079
He has a mother, he has you.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.639
He has a family.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.960
Who sent you?

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.999
No one sent us. We used to live here.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.959
You're lying!

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.078
I'm not lying to you, I swear.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.399
See, my whole family
have been killed.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.279
Let me explain.
They killed my family.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:43.279
I had two brothers, little siblings.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.399
- I don't know anything about it.
- I know you don't.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.439
This woman is the one who saved me.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.038
We lived in this house.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.599
She used to work with my father.
They did research on birds.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.559
She stayed here, at this house,
back in the garden.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.599
Don't lie. This isn't your place.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.599
Check over there. There's
another house that looks the same.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.680
You must be wrong.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.719
Do you really think
I'd mistake my own home?

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.599
I swear to God this is my house.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:12.959
- I'm not here to get you out.
- It wouldn't be possible.

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:17.078
- I don't want to live here.
- What do you want then?

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.919
Only to visit the place.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.799
You've seen it. You can go now.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.559
Just a quick walk-around.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.719
It's my first time here
since they were killed.

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:34.118
She was wearing it when they killed her.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.479
It's my mom's.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:43.279
I bought it.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.439
It's not true.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.479
It's not true. It's my mom's.

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.479
This t-shirt was my brother's.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.319
It's the only thing I've got left.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.839
Can no one tell me where they are?

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.879
We don't know. Some say here,
others say in the toilets.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.079
But where exactly?

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.079
In this toilet and that one.

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:32.079
They dumped others
in that small forest near Gahembe.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:33.800
Over there.

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.919
So are they here or are they there?

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.719
We don't know either.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.479
They would dump them anywhere.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.319
Everywhere. Even in toilets.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.279
Just cover it up.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.200
Did you notice?

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400
What?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.439
There are no more birds.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.479
Complete silence.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.239
There used to be so much commotion.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.519
Mommy used to joke that...

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.119
Dad had built the house not for her,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.279
but for the birds.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.439
Living off the three magic words:

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.959
"development for Africa."

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:50.679
Have you seen all the charities
that've been here?

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:53.880
Paradise!

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.719
I can't even keep up with the imported
French cheese and champagne.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.199
What about your old friend?
This general...

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.199
whatshisname, this fat Hutu?

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.999
He ran out of luck.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.639
Lost weight.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.479
He's been on trial
in a tribunal in Arusha.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.080
What about you?

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.119
There's business to be made.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.199
How much can one lose?

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.639
Bitero.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.159
Yes. Professor Bitero.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.879
He's a professor of sociology.

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:46.239
And he is responsible for killing people
in Claudine's district.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.079
We have to find him,

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:55.839
because maybe he will know
where the Mugambira family were buried.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.760
"Buried"?

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.559
As in "burials"?

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.359
Which burials?

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.039
They bulldozed dead people
into ditches.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.319
This earth will be restless
for at least 100 years.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.399
Will you think about it, please?

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.879
Oh, come on!

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.759
Can't you come here
as a regular muzungu?

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.399
- Excuse me...
- Get some rest?

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.039
Maybe go see them gorillas?

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.239
I'll give you a discount.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:38.559
Excuse me, and I'm gonna have
another one. Bottle.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.680
Thank you.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:01.640
Thank you.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.879
Someone's left this for you.

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:09.879
When was it?

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.199
In the afternoon.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.080
Sebastian.

01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:57.999
We fled to Uganda.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.319
I thought you were all dead.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.519
It's like I am dead.

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.479
How old are your children?

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.679
One is one year old,
and the other is two and a half.

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.199
How did you know I was in Kigali?

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.759
Kigali is small.

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.959
It's the one thing
that never changes here.

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.160
You're right.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.360
Claudine...

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.560
Go home.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.160
It's late.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.679
It's him all right.

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.679
Kneel here. Down!

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.399
You'll sing for us now.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:03.079
Sing like igishwi bird!

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.599
Fucking cockroach!

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.559
Sing! What are you waiting for?

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.519
Give us a thrush now!

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.319
A thrush! We're waiting!

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.679
Sing, Jean-Paul!

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.919
Sing like a male thrush!

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.280
Go on!

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.880
Thanks, Wolf.

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:48.039
Are you sure you want to meet him?

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.079
Tomorrow at 10:00.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.519
Tell me, Professor...

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:00.760
why?

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.599
You were our friend...

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.199
my father's friend.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.159
You were my godfather.

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.679
Yesterday it was us, today it is you.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.799
Let's see for those of tomorrow
who they will be.

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:44.879
I only wish to find their bodies
and bury them, nothing else.

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:58.839
Keep looking. You'll have a job
for the rest of your life.

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.639
Who is it again?

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:28.640
Claude.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Claude?

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.199
This is your grandfather.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:37.119
I've put together some money.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.279
I spoke with the nuns.
They'll look after you...

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.559
so you won't lack food.

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:50.560
Okay?

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.919
You must take care of yourself, Christi.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.079
I will try my best and get you papers
so you can join me.

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:05.839
Maybe there they'll be able to treat you.

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:17.480
Go.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.999
And never come back.

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:45.440
Anna?

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.399
Can I ask you something?

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.119
Did you love my father?

01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.400
Claudine?

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.359
Here you go.

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:11.639
Are you hungry?

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:14.599
What do you say?

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.919
Are you going to eat?

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.159
How was your day?

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.239
Well, have some of it at least!

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:54.400
Well?

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.320
That's right.
