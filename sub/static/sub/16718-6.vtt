00:28.840 --> 00:29.800
Help!

00:30.520 --> 00:31.680
I need help!

00:33.000 --> 00:34.040
I am here, Miss Samton.

00:34.800 --> 00:35.840
I am a carer.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.400
Where am I?  What happened?

00:38.880 --> 00:41.160
You're at the Angels
Memorial Hospital.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.520
Why does my head hurt?

00:44.480 --> 00:46.560
Why does everything hurt?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.600
No.  Please lay down.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.120
You need to rest.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.240
What happened to me

00:54.520 --> 00:56.560
I'll get a doctor.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.360
I'll be right back

01:01.280 --> 01:02.320
What do we have?

01:02.440 --> 01:03.920
Twenty-one year
old found on campus,

01:04.040 --> 01:06.240
blunt facial trauma,
forehead injury,

01:06.360 --> 01:08.880
Bruised hands due to an
argument with fellow students.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.800
Where is he?
Where is the one who did this?

01:10.920 --> 01:13.200
-What's your name?
-His name is Justin.  Justin Keller.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.280
Let's get him in.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.000
-What's happening?
-He is a hero.  That's going on.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.120
Will he get well again?

01:19.240 --> 01:20.800
Dr.  Dixon, you come with me.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.960
Twenty year old
college student, no

01:23.080 --> 01:27.240
site response, GCS
of 5, was intubated.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.280
Blunt injuries to ribs,
head and elbows.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.840
This is the guy
who lost the fight.

01:31.160 --> 01:35.040
He needs a trauma panel and
a head, chest and elbow CT.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.480
Dr.  Dixon, to the Center Stage.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.080
Justin, honey.
Everything will be fine.  I am here.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.280
You have to get out of here.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.400
You have to go to the waiting
room, you don't belong here.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.840
-Dr.  Dixon, he's yours.
-Cool.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.520
It's cool when both
lungs are bloated.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.760
Place a 36 French
catheter and Thora Seal.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.640
Mid axillary line,

01:53.960 --> 01:56.200
fifth intercostal space,
make an incision...

02:02.200 --> 02:03.560
That's him.  This is the guy!

02:04.120 --> 02:05.760
This animal doesn't
deserve any help.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.400
Not after what
he did to the girl.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.280
Ma'am, I said waiting room.
Now please.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.360
You don't belong here.

02:10.479 --> 02:11.440
More pressure.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.920
Mario, Noa, off to the X-ray.
Right away.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.160
Grate up, done.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.400
Very good, Doctor.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.440
You really mustn't be here.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.080
Can you show someone
the way out, please?

02:21.200 --> 02:22.480
-Yes, doctor.
-Thank you.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.000
My last memory is of dancing.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.840
To the song by Drake
and Rihanna Too Good.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.800
How did i hurt myself

02:32.920 --> 02:34.000
Did i fall

02:35.160 --> 02:37.600
I didn't drink
that much, but...

02:38.480 --> 02:39.440
Joy,

02:40.040 --> 02:42.400
You were found
unconscious on campus.

02:43.960 --> 02:48.160
About 180 meters
from the fraternity party.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.520
A man attacked you.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.000
What?

02:54.080 --> 02:55.440
No that...

02:56.160 --> 02:57.480
He was holding you.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.680
Fortunately,
another student just

03:01.800 --> 03:03.800
left the party and
pulled him off you.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.520
Did he pull him down?

03:11.720 --> 03:13.000
Please no...

03:13.480 --> 03:17.400
I'm so sorry Joy.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.040
No.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.280
You're welcome...

03:30.280 --> 03:32.520
Sorry, sorry.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.400
Is it true?  He is awake?

03:35.920 --> 03:36.880
Mike?

03:40.120 --> 03:42.440
Hey i'm here

03:51.480 --> 03:53.040
Oh my God.  Mike?

03:53.680 --> 03:55.080
Yeah mike.  Hey

03:56.440 --> 03:57.840
Can you hear me?

03:59.640 --> 04:00.720
Are you in there

04:02.680 --> 04:03.640
Yes.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.000
Hey

04:18.079 --> 04:19.040
I mean...

04:19.440 --> 04:21.000
It all happened so quickly.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.880
I saw the guy

04:25.360 --> 04:26.520
he was on top of her.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.080
And she didn't move.

04:29.480 --> 04:34.480
So I grabbed it
and pulled it down.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.040
Then I hit him until he fell.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.920
Then he didn't get up again.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.440
What about my
eye  I see lightning.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.760
-Is it bad?
-Possible corneal detachment.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.240
I'll call the ophthalmologist.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.840
He should be
here in a few hours.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.400
What about the bastard?
When do you know more about him?

04:58.200 --> 04:59.520
So how bad is it for him?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.320
Sorry, but we're not
talking about other patients.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.520
We finished taking
evidence from the attacker.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.520
Fingernails, saliva...

05:13.640 --> 05:15.560
I have a good feeling
about humanity.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.360
Could Justin be
charged with assault?

05:18.480 --> 05:19.360
Depends on...

05:20.000 --> 05:22.160
He just wanted to help.
He saved this girl!

05:25.600 --> 05:29.000
I was on the stage
shouting, "I'm dying.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.080
I'm dying."

05:30.200 --> 05:32.840
And one in the audience
called back: "We know."

05:33.880 --> 05:35.320
I want to ask you something.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.680
How do you get to work
every day?  On a tricycle?

05:38.520 --> 05:39.640
Actually in the stroller.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.400
A comedian?

05:41.520 --> 05:42.640
I love comedy clubs.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.480
And you are very funny.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.320
Dr.  Dixon, get
an autograph later.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.080
It could also be a
perforation or a blockage.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.200
Or a CAT scan.  And give
him 5 units of morphine.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.400
What if I went to
the bathroom first?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.280
Are Seth Greer's
results already there?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.480
Not yet.  I just
checked the values.

06:01.720 --> 06:02.880
Everything is normal with him.
Until now.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.240
Female, early 20s,

06:08.360 --> 06:10.000
found with
tonic-clonic seizures.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.200
No response to five
units of diazepam.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.040
The values ​​go down.  Center stage.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.480
Good, ready to move.
One two Three...

06:21.120 --> 06:23.720
He gets IV Lorazepam twice
and levetiracetam 500 mg.

06:23.840 --> 06:28.440
We need a complete blood count
with a urine test and a brain CT.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.040
Epilepsy?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.120
Probably.

06:36.720 --> 06:37.880
It's not epilepsy.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.400
The patient is Whitney Lithwick.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.680
Your seizures come from a
gastrosarcoma with metastases.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.800
I removed the main
tumor five years ago

06:47.440 --> 06:48.760
but it went to the brain.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.640
Let the urine test

06:50.760 --> 06:52.560
and check phenytoin
and tegretol levels.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.880
This is called "Hot Tamale".

08:30.960 --> 08:32.320
The nail polish.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.120
I have one called
"Bikini with a Martini".

08:37.200 --> 08:38.919
Who thinks that up, what?

09:02.560 --> 09:03.520
Mike.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.560
Fortunately, you are fine.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.240
His scores are good,
and he's going to be

09:07.360 --> 09:09.720
examined by the physical
therapist this afternoon.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.200
He'll be up soon and
ordering me around.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.400
Of course it will.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.480
He is iron, this boy.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.040
Wait, dad.  Let him talk.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.480
It's okay, Mike.
Take your time.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.800
We have all the time in The World.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.520
I can't feel my legs.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.960
Did you call your
oncologist like I told you?

09:43.600 --> 09:46.160
I told you I don't
need it anymore.

09:46.280 --> 09:49.840
And I told you the answer is no.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.840
Listen, I waited the
required ten days

09:54.400 --> 09:56.560
and now I just
need your final okay.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.760
-The law says...
-The law.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.080
Dr.  Campbell,

10:03.120 --> 10:04.400
i feel worse and worse.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.000
Whitney...

10:07.480 --> 10:08.560
You are young.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.680
You still have
your whole life...

10:10.800 --> 10:12.360
-Do I have this?
-Yes.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.640
A great day for me is
one without seizures.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.680
A good day is one when
it doesn't happen in public.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.760
If I don't break
down in yoga class

10:21.040 --> 10:22.920
or not peeing in at Forever 21.

10:25.640 --> 10:26.680
I can't drive

10:27.480 --> 10:28.640
don't ride a bike...

10:29.760 --> 10:32.280
Half the time I have to
use an iPad to speak.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.920
At the moment I'm still me

10:36.720 --> 10:38.360
but it won't last long

10:38.600 --> 10:40.000
and you know that.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.400
I mean, I still look good now.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.640
It's only a matter of time
before I brush my teeth

10:49.360 --> 10:50.720
or say my name

11:00.280 --> 11:01.720
I'm sorry whitney

11:05.440 --> 11:06.960
I'm not going to help you die.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.600
You are exactly the right doctor

11:24.400 --> 11:25.880
for her.

11:27.160 --> 11:30.920
No one else knows their
situation better than you.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.520
So remember to help her.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.400
But don't get lost.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.520
You have to listen to me.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.040
So go in there
and be their doctor.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.440
Hi.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.280
Did you reach your parents?

11:52.160 --> 11:54.640
My mom is on the
next flight from Ohio.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.720
She wants to take
me home for a while.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.560
Joy,

12:01.800 --> 12:03.680
You have a fractured pelvis.

12:04.000 --> 12:04.960
What?

12:05.080 --> 12:06.040
It will heal.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.680
It will take a few
weeks, and then...

12:07.800 --> 12:08.760
Then what?

12:10.600 --> 12:12.400
Everyone will think
it was my mistake.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.480
No.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.400
No, you didn't do
anything wrong.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.200
I'm a bitch who
got drunk at a party.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.000
I sensed that something
was wrong, but didn't listen.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.960
It's my fault that happened.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.000
I want to tell you
something, Joy.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.600
You resisted.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.320
What?

12:38.320 --> 12:40.600
Look at your nails,
look at your fingers.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.440
You don't get these
injuries just like that.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.840
You were brave, Joy.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.280
You fought against
him as best you could.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.600
Who saved me

12:55.640 --> 12:58.040
The ophthalmologist
will have to confirm it, but

12:58.160 --> 13:00.320
I don't see any evidence
of retinal detachment.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.360
A few more hours
and you can go home.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.120
Are you bleeding there?

13:05.560 --> 13:06.800
I do not think so.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.000
Let me see.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.080
I didn't notice that at all.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.640
That's just a small cut.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.400
Dr.  Kean, could you
sew this up, please?

13:12.520 --> 13:13.480
I will.

13:14.680 --> 13:15.920
I just spoke to your
mom on the phone.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.400
She's calling a lawyer now.

13:17.960 --> 13:18.920
It's a nightmare.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.000
Hey

13:21.120 --> 13:22.880
-How are you?
-Good.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.160
How is the girl

13:24.280 --> 13:25.440
That is why I am here.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.120
She is fine.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.840
She wanted me to go to you.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.360
She wants to thank you.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.520
According to CT, you
have extensive diverticulitis.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.480
This is inflammation
in the lower bowel.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.160
That's why I never go
to doctors or accountants

13:42.680 --> 13:43.800
they have something against me.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.840
Its white blood cells are
at 16,000, 92% neutrophils.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.000
Enough numbers man, you
sound like my bookmaker.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.080
We will give you strong
antibiotics intravenously.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.360
You will stay in the
hospital for a few days.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.560
Can we call someone

13:56.680 --> 13:57.640
A family member?

13:58.240 --> 13:59.520
Yes, call the Tonight Show.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.560
Maybe they'll finally
feel sorry for me?

14:03.920 --> 14:06.760
Because of the
fragments of bone pressing

14:06.880 --> 14:08.600
on your spinal cord,
you have two options.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.000
Option one, we don't
do anything that means...

14:12.120 --> 14:14.520
... that I stay like this.
Forever.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.680
What's the second option?

14:18.720 --> 14:21.760
We operate and try to
remove the fragments.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.760
I already contacted
Dr.  Jacopian,

14:25.120 --> 14:26.800
one of the two best spinal
surgeons in the country.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.200
And what happens if
the surgery goes badly?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.600
Then I'm a quadriplegic.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.400
Whenever you operate
on the upper spinal cord,

14:36.720 --> 14:38.120
the risk is very high.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.680
It takes me a few
days to think about it.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.760
Dad, if Mike doesn't do it now,
the window of opportunity is over.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.600
A couple of days don't change anything.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.200
I agree with Angus.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.720
The fragments could
injure the spinal cord and...

14:50.840 --> 14:53.920
I heard all of the opinions, but
I don't move away from them.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.320
You didn't hear mine

15:00.240 --> 15:01.200
I want the surgery.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.560
Hold on, Desmond.

15:09.480 --> 15:10.440
Desmond, wait...

15:11.240 --> 15:13.480
I am his father, not you!

15:14.160 --> 15:15.560
This is my child over there...

15:15.680 --> 15:16.640
He is not a child!

15:17.640 --> 15:18.960
You're growing up, Desmond.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.160
And you're lucky you saw it.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.280
Joy,

15:30.320 --> 15:31.280
this is justin.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.680
Hi.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.280
How are you?

15:37.760 --> 15:40.040
I am glad you found me in time.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.160
Yes.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.680
Me too.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.480
Can you tell me what happened

15:49.960 --> 15:51.480
I think this is not a good idea.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.920
You're welcome.  I
don't remember anything.

15:56.920 --> 15:57.880
I have to know it.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.520
-You are safe now.
-You're welcome.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.120
-Only that matters.
-You're welcome.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.400
You have to tell me

16:07.760 --> 16:08.720
You're welcome.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.400
You have palpitations.
You need to rest.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.720
-Tell me!
-Will she be back?

16:11.840 --> 16:13.000
Please leave.  It'll be fine.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.320
You have to go out please.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.400
Tell me.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.200
He got a fever.
The leukocytes are up to 20.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.440
The lactic acid
level is also high.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.520
Do you have pain?

16:27.640 --> 16:30.680
I'm always in pain,
that's why I'm so funny.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.320
The antibiotics are
not working on you.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.360
You will need emergency surgery.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.880
No, I can't do that, Doctor.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.320
I said yes, I am
not very motivated.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.200
You just have to lie there
and the others do the work.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.280
Like my girlfriend.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.280
If by "girlfriend"
you mean your hand.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.960
I'll steal it.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.360
Here he is!

16:50.720 --> 16:51.680
Is he dead yet?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.000
Why are you coming
in this elevator?

16:53.120 --> 16:54.360
Like you've been
to the Muppet Shop.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.120
What are you guys doing here?

16:56.240 --> 16:57.360
-There should be free food here.
-Yes.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.080
First, you have to bend
down and cough once.

17:00.680 --> 17:01.640
Tomorrow.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.640
Your phenytoin levels were low

17:04.880 --> 17:07.079
so I'll give you an
IV before you go.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.280
So hold on for a few
more hours and hopefully

17:09.400 --> 17:11.640
we won't see you
again anytime soon.

17:11.760 --> 17:12.720
Hardly likely.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.560
I need a stamp card
for the emergency room.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.520
After ten attacks I
get a free frappuccino.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.319
I heard of your
conversation with Campbell.

17:21.839 --> 17:25.000
Yes, he is probably
against assisted suicide.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.319
Maybe he's right?

17:29.160 --> 17:31.320
Despite the seizure medication,
there is still a lot you can do.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.920
Please don't say
"Bucket List" now.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.440
If anyone else says I should
bungee jump, I'll explode.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.240
Bungee jumping?
In your condition?

17:38.880 --> 17:40.000
That will split you in two.

17:40.840 --> 17:44.360
No, I was thinking more of something
like a giant ice cream sundae.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.680
An advantage if you
refuse chemotherapy.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.160
You can eat again.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.760
Nobody wants to talk
to me about my death.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.400
Neither my mom,

18:07.360 --> 18:08.320
nor my friends,

18:09.360 --> 18:10.400
not even my doctor...

18:13.280 --> 18:16.840
Sometimes people
find it hard to accept.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.320
I accepted it.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.840
There's not a part of
me that wants to die.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.840
I'm dying.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.080
I want to do it
while I am still me.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.240
Try the ice cream.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.920
That's the only thing
the kitchen gets right.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.480
Yes, the curve sheet... Yes.

19:54.680 --> 19:55.640
Was it him?

19:59.680 --> 20:01.240
Did you do this to me

20:05.640 --> 20:06.640
I know you...

20:07.160 --> 20:08.120
Now I know.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.640
You were at the party.
You looked at me!

20:12.240 --> 20:13.560
Look at me now

20:14.280 --> 20:15.240
Look at me now!

20:15.360 --> 20:16.440
Miss Samton, take a rest.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.600
I hope you die, you bastard!

20:18.720 --> 20:20.160
I hope you will die!

20:20.280 --> 20:21.240
Look at me!

20:21.360 --> 20:23.760
Look at me!  I hate you.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.480
- Break like me.
-Okay, calm down.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.880
She hyperventilates.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.720
Malaya, get the oxygen, please.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.160
-You have to sit down.
-Oh God.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.560
Breathe for us, will you?
Deep breaths.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.120
She's bleeding.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.600
-What?
- She's bleeding.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.280
Why did she walk around
with a broken pelvis?

20:48.920 --> 20:49.880
I was outside briefly...

20:50.000 --> 20:51.520
She is your patient.
Take care of them.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.520
Ethan, not now.
The blood pressure drops.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.120
Jesse, two units of red
blood cell concentrate.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.400
I give it by rapid infusion.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.480
Shall we bring her up?

20:57.600 --> 20:59.680
Not now.  Stabilize first
before the heart fails.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.760
What about the REBOA?

21:00.880 --> 21:02.480
We don't have any REBOAs anymore.

21:03.320 --> 21:04.720
Suggestions, people.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.560
Preperitoneal packing.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.400
I do not know that.
We never did that here.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.680
We open the abdominal wall.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.960
Tamponade the
preperitoneal space

21:13.080 --> 21:14.680
to stop bleeding
until we get it up.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.920
We did that in the
operational area.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.280
Okay, Malaya, get the
abdominal cut pads, please.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.760
The systolic blood
pressure is down to 64.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.040
All right, we have to do it now.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.320
Iodine please.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.400
I'm ready.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.320
I now press the bladder.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.000
Good, pad the other
side of the basin.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.440
Abdominal wall pads.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.760
Firmly.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.640
That's the only thing
keeping her alive now.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.000
OK.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.560
The blood pressure is back at 92.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.080
It works.

21:44.640 --> 21:47.240
Give blood open wide.
Let the OP know.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.200
She is ready.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.360
EMERGENCY ADMISSION AMBULANCE

21:59.400 --> 22:01.120
One proctologist asks:

22:01.240 --> 22:03.200
"How did the
flowers get in there?"

22:03.320 --> 22:04.680
And the other says:

22:05.320 --> 22:07.000
"I don't know,
there was no card."

22:09.440 --> 22:11.040
The boy is very promising.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.520
The operating room is ready for you.
How are you?

22:13.640 --> 22:17.880
I've rarely looked forward to
an intestinal surgery since...

22:18.920 --> 22:19.880
... the tax return?

22:20.160 --> 22:21.560
... last week's poker game?

22:21.720 --> 22:23.160
Since my divorce hearing.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.120
Okay it's time

22:27.960 --> 22:28.920
Clarify everything.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.400
-Good, let's go.
-One moment please.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.200
Thank you.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.280
All good?

22:34.800 --> 22:36.560
-Yes I'm fine.
-All right.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.200
-Stewart.  Do us a favor
-Which?

22:39.360 --> 22:40.800
Run towards the light.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.880
You just want to
steal my best jokes.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.520
And shave his back.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.600
If I survive

22:46.840 --> 22:49.320
I'll work with you on
this proctologist joke

22:49.440 --> 22:53.200
and then you'll rock
the doctors' conventions.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.840
My job is to keep
patients alive.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.200
Not to help them die.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.440
This is not about
you or what you want.

23:00.560 --> 23:01.520
It's what she wants.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.280
Fine  You know what she want?

23:03.400 --> 23:04.800
She has been my
patient for years

23:04.920 --> 23:06.080
You have only known her for hours.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.640
This disease has dictated

23:08.760 --> 23:09.720
everything in her
life since she had it.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.080
Now she wants to
determine how it will end.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.720
Or she drowns in self-pity.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.880
Have you ever heard the
saying, "Don't endanger yourself?"

23:17.400 --> 23:19.560
If someone drowns,
you don't jump after them.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.680
You throw a rope to
her and hold on to it.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.440
You never let go

23:24.800 --> 23:27.120
no matter how tired
or discouraged she is.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.880
Why do I think it's not
about Whitney anymore?

23:32.240 --> 23:34.240
Already clear.  Now
you think you know me.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.160
Not yet.  But you just
got more interesting.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.280
What if he doesn't make it?

24:02.040 --> 24:03.440
I can't go through this again.

24:09.840 --> 24:12.040
Mike will be fine, Dad.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.040
He is strong you know

24:19.880 --> 24:21.240
Iron and so.

24:25.640 --> 24:26.600
Hey...

24:27.800 --> 24:29.720
Just now

24:30.160 --> 24:32.120
remove the back of the vertebra,

24:33.280 --> 24:36.440
so that they can
reach the bone splinter.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.320
What happens then?

24:49.880 --> 24:51.200
As soon as that is removed

24:52.080 --> 24:54.040
cut out the bone fragments...

24:58.720 --> 24:59.680
Do you have...

25:00.760 --> 25:02.000
Do you have...

25:02.120 --> 25:04.200
Did you talk

25:10.320 --> 25:12.160
No not true.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.360
That's why I'm not...

25:16.720 --> 25:18.920
Whitney, god.
Are you all right?

25:19.040 --> 25:20.680
Dr.  Campbell said
you had another seizure.

25:20.800 --> 25:21.760
MY MOM

25:21.880 --> 25:23.120
What were you
doing outside so late?

25:23.520 --> 25:24.800
Fortunately, you're
not hurt any worse!

25:25.720 --> 25:27.200
We gave her phenytoin.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.640
When can she go home again?

25:36.680 --> 25:38.000
Didn't you call about that?

25:38.120 --> 25:39.560
You wanted to
talk to your doctors?

25:42.880 --> 25:44.560
I i...

25:44.680 --> 25:45.640
We talked about it.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.840
You don't do that, that's that.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.880
Tell her this is
crazy, she is only 22!

25:54.560 --> 25:57.880
PLEASE MOM.  MY LIFE.

26:04.760 --> 26:05.720
Mrs. Lithwick...

26:06.400 --> 26:08.440
My name is gerri.
I'm not married.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.960
And you shouldn't persuade
me to let her do that.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.920
She was still a child
when she was diagnosed.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.520
She was playing softball
when the coach noticed

26:23.360 --> 26:24.720
that she has a stomach ache.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.520
But she never complained.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.800
Whitney wasn't like that.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.240
Even when the doctors
said she had cancer

26:35.880 --> 26:37.440
even when I broke down

26:38.040 --> 26:39.560
and her friends
stopped coming to visit

26:40.800 --> 26:42.880
and her little body was
pumped full of medication

26:46.640 --> 26:49.240
she faced the matter.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.040
She can still fight it.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.640
Do you know ALS?

27:03.000 --> 27:04.520
I took part in the "Ice
Bucket Challenge".

27:08.000 --> 27:08.960
Her father?

27:10.080 --> 27:11.040
Mother.

27:11.520 --> 27:12.480
I'm so sorry.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.560
I was 11 the last time
she could hug me.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.960
She died four years later.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.160
She was a strong woman.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.920
And if she had a
chance to end it sooner

27:28.480 --> 27:29.440
then she would have done that.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.920
Your daughter is strong too.

27:32.920 --> 27:33.880
Yes.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.160
That's why she
can still fight it.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.720
She is stronger than she thinks.

27:38.880 --> 27:39.960
And if I may say so

27:41.440 --> 27:43.280
maybe it is stronger
than you think.

27:55.560 --> 27:56.520
Are you all right?

27:58.080 --> 27:59.520
I'm just trying to
clear something up.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.680
Can I help?

28:01.040 --> 28:02.000
Not at that.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.800
A paramedic just
found it in the car.

28:07.640 --> 28:08.600
They belong to Joy.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.400
She must have lost it
when she was picked up.

28:12.640 --> 28:13.680
There's blood on it.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.600
Sure because she hurt her hand

28:16.080 --> 28:17.800
when she stabbed
Seth with the key.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.240
That's not possible,
I examined Seth.

28:21.720 --> 28:23.400
He had bruises
but no stab wounds.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.480
Not even a scratch.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.320
But we know who.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.080
They got the wrong guy.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.640
Seth collapses in room 18.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.480
The victim's keys.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.040
He's bleeding
through the chest tube.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.480
The blood pressure drops rapidly.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.120
Take off the handcuffs.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.880
-Take it off right away!
-OK, doctor.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.080
His heart stops the same.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.440
How much is he losing?

28:49.160 --> 28:50.600
500 ml in 30 seconds.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.880
We have to open his chest.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.400
He has to go to the Center Stage.  Come on.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.720
The blood pressure is 40 to 22.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.480
He's bleeding profusely.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.000
Do you recognize the origin?

29:08.080 --> 29:09.440
I can't see the source.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.520
Incredible that we wronged him.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.200
Keep vacuuming, please.
And more swabs, please.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.160
It must be the pulmonary
vein, but I can't find it.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.760
Here... spreader, please.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.720
Let's open it up.
How is it now?

29:31.520 --> 29:32.960
I have it.  Clamp.

29:35.720 --> 29:36.680
The bleeding has stopped.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.440
The blood pressure rises.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.960
Let's get him ready for surgery.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.000
He saved her...

29:43.400 --> 29:45.440
Yes.  And we saved him.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.280
What's happening?

29:57.560 --> 29:58.520
He died?

29:58.640 --> 30:00.280
No, you are not that lucky.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.520
What are you talking about?

30:01.880 --> 30:03.320
We need to re-examine
your wounds.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.320
What?  How so?

30:05.440 --> 30:07.160
Because these are defensive wounds.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.400
Joy was holding her keys
when you attacked her.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.040
Just like you learn in
the self-defense course.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.720
It wasn't like that.

30:13.840 --> 30:14.960
I'll tell you how it was.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.240
I have no time for that.

30:16.360 --> 30:17.400
Vanessa, let's go.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.760
You are not going anywhere.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.920
I never saw her until I
tore the animal off of her.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.160
Vanessa, tell them!

30:24.760 --> 30:25.960
You lie.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.440
Let me go.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.800
You are a liar.

30:30.360 --> 30:33.560
-I saw you with her.
-Vanessa...

30:33.680 --> 30:36.280
At the party.  You
flirted with her at the bar.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.120
I saw you both together.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.360
I wanted so badly
to believe you.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.080
You are the animal

30:45.520 --> 30:46.840
Keep your mouth shut!

30:47.040 --> 30:48.360
Just shut up!

30:48.480 --> 30:50.040
It was not me.  It was not me...

30:50.600 --> 30:53.200
No, it wasn't me.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.640
The top of the deck.

31:02.520 --> 31:04.720
What is?  No no.  Stop stop

31:04.840 --> 31:06.120
What are you talking about, Willis?

31:06.320 --> 31:07.280
How you fool me...

31:09.240 --> 31:10.200
How is stu

31:11.080 --> 31:12.440
Did Jimmy Hoffa
be found in there?

31:15.440 --> 31:16.640
Doc?  Why are you
making such a face?

31:18.240 --> 31:19.200
I am so sorry.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.080
We...

31:21.760 --> 31:23.480
We did what we could.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.440
What?

31:26.720 --> 31:27.920
No...

31:28.320 --> 31:29.280
Typical Stewart.

31:29.720 --> 31:30.920
He hits the bill.

31:32.880 --> 31:33.960
I can not do this.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.960
I knew it!  Never leave the
best jokes to an amateur.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.440
You cursed...

31:43.560 --> 31:45.200
I scared you, didn't I?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.440
You only die on the stage.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.160
No, I'm not dying on stage.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.640
I'll die if I'm not on her.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.120
Do you know what was found in me?

31:51.280 --> 31:54.600
A 1972 New York pastry sandwich.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.360
Oh God!

32:00.840 --> 32:02.360
I yelled at him.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.520
I berated him terribly.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.880
He saved my life

32:10.680 --> 32:12.880
And I said I want him to die

32:13.680 --> 32:15.880
Don't blame yourself for it.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.680
The only culprit here is Justin.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.760
I do not know.

32:25.080 --> 32:26.840
Maybe this is the new me.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.760
The girl who was raped.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.520
That's the worst.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.280
One day I'll tell my husband...

32:39.920 --> 32:40.880
No.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.600
He stole a night from you.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.320
He can't get another
second from you.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.560
You are more than the
bad that happened to you.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.800
You are the grace that follows.

33:14.680 --> 33:15.640
How is he?

33:16.440 --> 33:19.640
It went as expected,
but he will again.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.280
He has a long way to go.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.880
Can I get closer to him?

33:25.440 --> 33:26.400
Naturally.

33:51.680 --> 33:52.760
You didn't leave me alone

33:53.800 --> 33:55.320
And I won't leave
you alone either.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.679
I heard you used
to play softball.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.320
Before.

34:14.080 --> 34:16.760
But I know what the end
of the game looks like.

34:17.159 --> 34:18.239
Is that the ninth inning?

34:18.639 --> 34:19.600
No...

34:21.360 --> 34:22.960
This is a break.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.199
Don't worry, it's sterile.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.480
I thought you wanted
a drink with me.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.080
That is not for me.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.560
Are you all right?

35:01.320 --> 35:02.280
Yes.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.120
Hold up your hand honey

35:41.360 --> 35:42.320
Thank you.

36:16.320 --> 36:17.520
I won't stop it

36:19.080 --> 36:20.960
but i have to watch your heart

36:37.440 --> 36:38.400
Mommy...

36:39.480 --> 36:40.440
Mommy...

36:41.240 --> 36:42.200
Do not Cry.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.120
It's OK.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.840
God.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.840
I want you to rest.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.680
I want you to rest now.

37:50.040 --> 37:52.720
You may still feel the
remains of the anesthetic...

37:53.520 --> 37:54.480
It's okay.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.200
We won't know anything
for a few more days.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.520
But Dr.  Rorish says your
job is waiting for you...

38:02.720 --> 38:03.920
Whenever you are ready.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.520
Seven years ago.

38:10.440 --> 38:11.400
What?

38:12.240 --> 38:13.400
Your first year.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.960
My first year at university.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.360
Do not remind me of that.

38:21.520 --> 38:24.240
I felt really bad.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.360
I remember begging you to come.

38:28.840 --> 38:29.800
Yes but...

38:31.720 --> 38:33.400
You asked the right questions.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.480
And...

38:36.160 --> 38:37.760
I knew you were going
to be a great doctor.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.560
That's why I made you my agent.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.800
Because you are the most
thoughtful person I know.

38:48.000 --> 38:48.960
Thank you.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.000
No, Angus.

38:53.520 --> 38:54.480
I thank you.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.160
Willis.

39:04.840 --> 39:06.000
What the hell did you do?

39:07.280 --> 39:08.240
I helped her.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.160
They helped her kill herself.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.520
Taking into account
the Dying Care Act.

39:14.640 --> 39:19.240
No, according to the law, she
asks her doctor and waits 10 days.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.280
-She asked you.
-Yes.  Me!

39:22.000 --> 39:22.960
Not her.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.040
She waited 10 days.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.880
Do you think another 10 days
would have changed something?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.320
Do you think she would
have thought about it?

39:28.440 --> 39:29.920
-That's not what it is about.
- It's all about that.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.800
That's what the law is for.
It gives her her dignity.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.400
That wasn't your decision!

39:34.520 --> 39:36.680
That's true.  And neither does yours.
It was hers.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.360
I would have liked
to say goodbye to her.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.880
I'm so sorry.

40:03.120 --> 40:04.680
She is an extraordinary
young woman.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.720
Yes.

40:10.920 --> 40:11.880
Yes.
