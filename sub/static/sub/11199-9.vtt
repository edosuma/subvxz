00:01.848 --> 00:05.545
<i>Teal'c and Bra'tac believe that the only</i>
<i>way to eliminate all the system lords...</i>

00:05.619 --> 00:08.554
is to recruit as manyJaffa
into the fifth column as possible.

00:08.622 --> 00:11.386
Only when their numbers are sufficient
would it be possible to rise up...

00:11.458 --> 00:13.892
and unilaterally destroy
all the Goa'uld at once.

00:13.960 --> 00:17.396
Even then, Ba'al controls the Super
Soldier army, which cannot be turned.

00:17.464 --> 00:18.897
<i>Incoming wormhole.</i>

00:18.965 --> 00:22.059
So even if the rebelJaffa can take out
the majority of the system lords...

00:22.135 --> 00:24.296
there'd still be
a massive war to fight.

00:24.371 --> 00:26.862
The problem is, though,
Ishta doesn't want to wait.

00:26.940 --> 00:30.899
Moloc is continuing to order the deaths
of all femaleJaffa born in his domain...

00:30.977 --> 00:33.741
and her underground railroad
to Ha'ktyl can't save them all.

00:33.814 --> 00:37.113
Even now, she's organizing
a rebellion to overthrow Moloc.

00:37.184 --> 00:41.245
Now Teal'c and Bra'tac are trying
to convince her to see the bigger picture.

00:43.623 --> 00:45.784
What was my question again?

00:45.859 --> 00:47.793
"How's it going?"

00:47.861 --> 00:50.295
Seemed so innocuous at the time.

00:50.364 --> 00:52.992
Fellas! How was the trip?

00:53.066 --> 00:56.365
I have been betrayed
by those I trusted most.

00:56.436 --> 00:58.836
That good, eh?

00:58.905 --> 01:01.169
His mood is foul indeed.

01:01.241 --> 01:04.699
Greetings.
It is good to see you both.

01:04.778 --> 01:09.112
- Bra'tac, what's wrong?
- There was a complication.

01:09.182 --> 01:10.513
Ishta?

01:12.018 --> 01:16.284
She is well
and as lovely as ever, O'Neill.

01:16.356 --> 01:19.689
- The problem, I fear, lies with Rya'c.
- Is he okay?

01:19.760 --> 01:23.696
He is in love...
and plans to be married.

02:38.905 --> 02:41.772
So when's all this supposed to happen?

02:44.344 --> 02:45.777
Three days.

02:45.846 --> 02:49.646
Three days, huh?
That's kind of quick.

02:49.716 --> 02:51.047
Indeed.

02:51.117 --> 02:55.383
Well, you know, love is
a strange and mysterious...

02:55.455 --> 02:57.320
thing.

03:02.128 --> 03:06.064
Rya'c did not even consult me
before making this decision.

03:06.132 --> 03:09.533
It is obvious this girl has caused
all reason to leave Rya'c's head.

03:09.603 --> 03:12.731
- Zero serving three.
- Serving eight.

03:12.806 --> 03:14.467
Eight.

03:19.112 --> 03:22.377
So, what's Ishta think of all this?

03:22.449 --> 03:25.316
Ishta believes that traditions
should persist at all cost...

03:25.385 --> 03:28.047
especially in the face of oppression.

03:28.622 --> 03:30.852
I see.

03:34.261 --> 03:37.424
Rya'c is too young
to know what love is, O'Neill...

03:37.497 --> 03:39.897
or how it inevitably
weakens a warrior's resolve.

03:41.801 --> 03:45.100
Look, T, I'm not gonna
tell you how to raise your kid...

03:45.171 --> 03:48.902
but I've always found that sticking your
fingers in your ears and humming loudly...

03:48.975 --> 03:52.240
solves a whole slew of problems.

03:52.312 --> 03:54.837
What good am I as a father, O'Neill...

03:54.915 --> 03:58.715
if I cannot keep my son
from making this crucial mistake?

04:01.354 --> 04:04.619
<i>Unscheduled off-world activation.</i>

04:09.596 --> 04:11.860
Got one.

04:14.334 --> 04:16.859
Receiving I DC, sir. It's Ishta.

04:16.937 --> 04:19.303
Open the iris.

04:29.449 --> 04:31.212
Greetings.

04:31.284 --> 04:35.550
There is an urgent matter we must discuss.
Ha'ktyl may have been compromised.

04:40.627 --> 04:42.151
How do you know?

04:42.228 --> 04:44.389
Yesterday we were to meet
one of our contacts:

04:44.464 --> 04:47.797
A high priestess stationed
within Moloc's temple.

04:47.867 --> 04:50.392
She failed to appear at the allotted time.

04:50.470 --> 04:54.031
- You must evacuate immediately.
- I agree.

04:54.107 --> 04:57.736
But we know not of another
uninhabited planet like Ha'ktyl.

04:58.812 --> 05:01.372
Hiding a large group
of female warriors and children...

05:01.448 --> 05:05.851
within a populated planet in Moloc's
domain is difficult and dangerous.

05:05.919 --> 05:09.912
Well, I'm sure we could
help you folks out. Carter?

05:09.990 --> 05:13.426
No problem. We have a number
of possible worlds on record...

05:13.493 --> 05:17.520
but they should be further explored
before you take up permanent residence.

05:17.597 --> 05:20.794
If Moloc is aware of our location...

05:20.867 --> 05:25.600
every moment my people remain on Ha'ktyl
puts them at greater risk.

05:39.653 --> 05:41.644
You're welcome to stay here.

05:44.357 --> 05:46.416
I'll go start the paperwork.

06:15.955 --> 06:18.014
Colonel Carter, Dr. Jackson.

06:18.091 --> 06:20.025
Rya'c, it's good to see you again.

06:20.093 --> 06:22.493
This is my <i>sim'ka,</i> Kar'yn.

06:22.562 --> 06:25.690
Rya'c, stop using those old terms.
We are betrothed.

06:25.765 --> 06:28.359
And it is an honor to meet
friends of my husband-to-be.

06:28.435 --> 06:30.596
Right back at you.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.535
Is she not the most beautiful
thing you've ever seen?

06:32.605 --> 06:36.507
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.
I am not an object to be worshipped.

06:39.312 --> 06:42.247
Thank you for agreeing
to host our union ceremony.

06:42.315 --> 06:44.681
It will be an honor to be
betrothed among friends.

06:44.751 --> 06:47.948
- Oh, you're gonna have the wedding here?
- Of course.

06:48.021 --> 06:51.650
Ishta said it may take some time to find
a suitable planet for our new home.

06:51.725 --> 06:54.626
We are to be married in three days.

06:56.029 --> 06:58.361
There is much to do.

07:00.366 --> 07:02.561
Excuse us.

07:04.471 --> 07:06.598
- They're having the wedding here.
- Yeah.

07:06.673 --> 07:08.834
Does Jack know about this?

07:10.009 --> 07:13.410
I'm gonna work
on finding them a planet.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.209
Yeah.

07:23.323 --> 07:25.223
Come in.

07:27.127 --> 07:28.754
Bra'tac.

07:33.767 --> 07:38.670
- What's that smell?
- I believe that is the horses.

07:41.307 --> 07:45.004
The warriors of Ha'ktyl
are grateful for your generosity.

07:45.078 --> 07:48.206
Well, you know me-

07:48.281 --> 07:53.241
always willing to help those
who... need help.

07:53.319 --> 07:56.152
You are indeed
a wise and gracious leader...

07:56.222 --> 07:58.747
O'Neill of Minnesota.

07:58.825 --> 08:00.793
Sit down, you old coot.

08:02.729 --> 08:04.219
What?

08:05.598 --> 08:09.967
I am to officiate the rite of everlasting
union between Rya'c and Kar'yn.

08:11.304 --> 08:13.738
I have consulted
with Ishta on the matter...

08:13.807 --> 08:16.105
and despite the evacuation of Ha'ktyl...

08:16.176 --> 08:18.667
she wishes the wedding
to proceed as planned...

08:18.745 --> 08:20.770
and as scheduled.

08:20.847 --> 08:22.815
Meaning here?

08:22.882 --> 08:25.817
A more suitable world
is not likely to be found in time.

08:25.885 --> 08:30.447
Delaying the ceremony would only grant
another victory to Moloc's tyranny.

08:30.523 --> 08:34.516
You know what it took to get approval
for Tailgate Tuesdays, huh?

08:40.266 --> 08:41.631
There'll be cake?

08:55.548 --> 08:57.607
You have been avoiding me.

08:59.586 --> 09:02.987
You have indicated I am not
worthy of your presence.

09:03.056 --> 09:05.149
How so?

09:05.225 --> 09:10.322
Your refusal to bless this union
is an insult to Kar'yn and thus to me.

09:10.396 --> 09:12.660
That is not what I intended.

09:12.732 --> 09:17.499
Rya'c has pledged to help lead theJaffa
in the battle against the Goa'uld.

09:17.570 --> 09:19.697
As have I and my people.

09:21.908 --> 09:25.844
A warrior is always stronger
with another at his side.

09:25.912 --> 09:29.905
So you must believe Kar'yn
to be an unworthy warrior...

09:29.983 --> 09:32.042
and I'm at fault as her teacher.

09:32.118 --> 09:35.178
Ishta, this is not about you.

09:35.255 --> 09:39.157
Soon enough, Rya'c will have to choose
between his family responsibility...

09:39.225 --> 09:42.524
and to that of his cause,
just as I once did.

09:42.595 --> 09:45.996
I merely believe that he is young
and has much time ahead...

09:46.065 --> 09:49.694
and need not undertake
such decisions so soon.

09:49.769 --> 09:53.899
In the same way Rya'c
had no say in your decision...

09:53.973 --> 09:56.134
you have no say in his.

10:01.781 --> 10:04.909
None of us choose oppression
at the hand of the Goa'uld...

10:04.984 --> 10:07.544
nor what must be done
to free ourselves of it...

10:07.620 --> 10:11.386
but we must not sacrifice
that which makes us Jaffa!

10:14.360 --> 10:16.828
I have organized
both men and women...

10:16.896 --> 10:19.729
to fight together,
to rise up against Moloc.

10:21.401 --> 10:23.665
Maybe once we are free of his tyranny...

10:23.736 --> 10:26.899
you will see that
we are worthy of your war.

10:26.973 --> 10:30.909
Overthrowing Moloc alone
will ultimately prove nothing.

10:30.977 --> 10:35.243
Were he to fall, his worlds and armies
would be usurped by another Goa'uld.

10:35.315 --> 10:39.809
I will not stand idly by and watch more of
my sisters slain at the hand of Moloc...

10:39.886 --> 10:43.344
while you and the leaders
of this so-called Jaffa rebellion-

10:43.423 --> 10:47.291
you plot and you scheme
and you ultimately do nothing!

10:47.360 --> 10:50.454
You have no wish to fight side by side-
only to control and dominate.

10:50.530 --> 10:52.964
As my sisters have been
for generations!

10:53.032 --> 10:55.432
As you will continue to be
because of your shortsightedness!

10:55.501 --> 10:58.129
I will not rest until Moloc is dead!

10:58.204 --> 11:01.765
I will not rest
until all Goa'uld are dead.

11:15.621 --> 11:19.022
- They want a what?
- A goat, sir.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.127
You can tell them lamb
is far less gamy.

11:28.134 --> 11:30.466
They want it for a ritual sacrifice.

11:30.536 --> 11:33.733
Yeah, well, you can tell them
that's not gonna happen.

11:33.806 --> 11:36.240
Yeah, I was hoping you'd say that.

11:36.309 --> 11:39.142
They can have a piñata.
That's always fun.

11:39.212 --> 11:41.203
I'll suggest it, sir.

11:52.158 --> 11:55.252
Please tell me you're close
to finding a planet.

11:55.328 --> 11:57.922
We scouted one yesterday
that Ishta seems comfortable with.

11:57.997 --> 12:00.329
Fresh water, stable climate.

12:04.137 --> 12:06.662
Good. When's moving day?

12:06.739 --> 12:10.106
Ishta thinks it'll take about a week
to get a livable camp going.

12:10.176 --> 12:13.202
- A week?
- Yes, sir.

12:13.279 --> 12:16.976
The wedding
is still gonna happen here.

12:17.050 --> 12:18.574
Have you seen Teal'c?

12:18.651 --> 12:22.087
- I think he's locked himself in his room.
- That chicken.

12:24.891 --> 12:28.019
Let this fire bear witness
to this ceremony.

12:28.094 --> 12:32.758
May its flames keep warm the souls
of those who came before us.

12:32.832 --> 12:35.995
We ask those spirits now
to bless this union...

12:36.069 --> 12:39.971
and to protect it through
each day of its existence.

12:40.039 --> 12:42.701
And then the horn will sound.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.377
Good.

12:52.452 --> 12:56.718
Now... you'll place
the circle of fidelity...

12:56.789 --> 12:59.622
upon Kar'yn's head.

13:09.869 --> 13:14.306
And you, the totem of bravery
around Rya'c's neck.

13:24.951 --> 13:28.944
The bride will then kneel
before her husband in respect.

13:32.258 --> 13:35.523
- I will do no such thing.
- Kar'yn.

13:35.595 --> 13:38.393
I kneel before no man,
not even my husband.

13:38.464 --> 13:41.262
This action has been part
of the ceremony for thousands-

13:41.334 --> 13:44.462
Then he should kneel
before me as well.

13:44.537 --> 13:47.438
Or am I too weak to have such respect
given to me in return?

13:47.507 --> 13:49.372
You disgrace my name.

13:49.442 --> 13:51.842
Perhaps if we took a short recess-

13:51.911 --> 13:55.745
And if you insist on treating me
like a fragile handmaiden...

13:55.815 --> 13:58.648
then I have chosen poorly for a husband.

13:58.718 --> 14:01.778
Well, perhaps I have chosen
poorly as well.

14:14.767 --> 14:18.828
I can see why one
must rehearse these events.

14:20.940 --> 14:23.408
Unscheduled off-world activation.

14:28.981 --> 14:31.677
We're receiving a message.
On screen.

14:36.455 --> 14:38.946
Ishta, this concerns you.

14:41.794 --> 14:44.854
It's from one of my contacts
among Moloc's Jaffa.

14:44.931 --> 14:48.389
- He's requesting a summit.
- For what reason?

14:48.467 --> 14:52.597
Our forces that are hiding
among theJaffa of Moloc...

14:52.672 --> 14:55.072
have become large...

14:55.141 --> 14:57.871
but there are still many
who are loyal to him.

14:57.944 --> 15:00.777
We risk being exposed.

15:00.846 --> 15:05.374
We must send the coordinates of the new
home world to those who will attend.

15:05.451 --> 15:10.445
Very well.
I will accompany you to this summit.

15:10.523 --> 15:13.287
You have no say in our matters.

15:13.359 --> 15:15.725
Perhaps there is counsel
I can provide.

15:18.531 --> 15:20.897
You will abide by my ruling.

15:33.446 --> 15:35.380
Can I come with you?

15:35.448 --> 15:38.474
Do not be foolish.
You have a union to prepare for.

15:38.551 --> 15:40.917
There will be no union.

15:44.624 --> 15:50.529
Kar'yn, you must learn not to let
your emotions take you to such extremes.

15:50.596 --> 15:55.590
I cannot be betrothed to Rya'c.
He is as pigheaded as his father.

15:56.969 --> 15:58.800
Until you have fought
as many battles...

15:58.871 --> 16:02.432
do not speak ofTeal'c of Chulak
with such disrespect.

16:02.508 --> 16:05.136
Without him,
we would not have tretonin...

16:05.211 --> 16:08.977
and we'd still be slaves
to the Goa'uld symbiotes.

16:09.048 --> 16:11.175
But how can you accept
his affection...

16:11.250 --> 16:14.117
knowing he does not support
our war against Moloc...

16:14.186 --> 16:17.815
and the archaic traditions
that oppress femaleJaffa?

16:22.995 --> 16:25.463
We differ often...

16:25.531 --> 16:29.490
but deep down we both possess
the same hunger for freedom.

16:29.568 --> 16:32.264
Does he not see me fit for Rya'c?

16:32.338 --> 16:35.330
He could search a thousand worlds
and never find someone like you.

16:37.443 --> 16:40.378
Teal'c has sacrificed much
in the war against the Goa'uld...

16:40.446 --> 16:44.348
and does not wish Rya'c
to feel the pain of such loss.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.214
What about Rya'c?

16:46.285 --> 16:49.846
He does not respect me as a warrior
as Teal'c respects you.

16:49.922 --> 16:52.720
That took some convincing.
Believe me.

16:54.427 --> 16:56.554
What you must remember...

16:56.629 --> 17:00.565
is that as much as you
desire Rya'c's respect...

17:00.633 --> 17:02.999
he too burns for yours.

17:16.215 --> 17:19.184
Your parries are too low.
Hold your staff higher.

17:19.251 --> 17:21.685
Step into each blocking blow.

17:23.022 --> 17:24.580
Leave me be.

17:26.392 --> 17:28.360
As you wish.

17:29.795 --> 17:33.856
Have I not been a dutiful son?
Have I not brought honor to my name?

17:33.933 --> 17:36.026
You have indeed.

17:36.102 --> 17:38.696
Then why will my father
not bless my union with Kar'yn?

17:38.771 --> 17:43.208
- Then the union is still to be?
- That is not the point.

17:43.275 --> 17:45.266
You have made a choice.

17:45.344 --> 17:48.541
You pledged your life
to fight for freedom for allJaffa.

17:48.614 --> 17:51.048
It is a war you must
commit to without question.

17:51.117 --> 17:53.210
I know!

17:53.285 --> 17:56.914
That is why my father
abandoned my mother and l-

17:56.989 --> 17:59.856
because we made him weak.

17:59.925 --> 18:01.449
That is not true.

18:01.527 --> 18:06.555
He knows I forgave him for that long ago.
I understand why it was necessary.

18:06.632 --> 18:09.499
Do you? Hmm?

18:09.568 --> 18:13.732
Teal'c stayed first prime of Apophis as
long as he did because he feared for you.

18:13.806 --> 18:17.173
He committed atrocities
in the name of the Goa'uld...

18:17.243 --> 18:19.541
because he wanted you
and your mother to be safe.

18:19.612 --> 18:22.638
When he chose to leave
to join the Tauri...

18:22.715 --> 18:25.240
it was the most difficult
thing he has ever done.

18:25.317 --> 18:29.947
It is not you that made him weak,
but his own fear and doubt.

18:30.022 --> 18:33.651
When he realized the Goa'uld
could indeed be defeated...

18:33.726 --> 18:37.594
that if he fought hard enough,
you could one day be free...

18:39.231 --> 18:41.256
it made him stronger.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.858
It is the same for me with Kar'yn.

18:43.936 --> 18:47.531
She fuels my desire to fight for freedom.

18:47.606 --> 18:51.007
We know what we must face,
and we choose to do it together.

18:54.213 --> 18:57.114
You still have much
to learn about yourself...

18:57.183 --> 18:59.117
about being a warrior...

18:59.185 --> 19:01.847
and neither of you truly know
what we will all face...

19:01.921 --> 19:04.082
in full-scale war with the Goa'uld.

19:04.156 --> 19:06.750
I do not need his blessing.

19:08.727 --> 19:11.787
No, you do not.

19:13.799 --> 19:15.824
And he insults Kar'yn.

19:15.901 --> 19:18.699
She is a formidable warrior
who deserves his respect.

19:19.905 --> 19:21.099
And yours.

19:34.720 --> 19:38.918
The ranks of rebelJaffa
are sizable enough to win.

19:38.991 --> 19:43.325
The time to strike... is now.

19:43.395 --> 19:47.491
Aron is right. If we wait much longer,
it is only a matter of time...

19:47.566 --> 19:50.967
before our numbers grow too large
for Moloc not to discover.

19:52.238 --> 19:54.229
We risk losing everything.

19:57.476 --> 20:01.412
Aron is right.
We must strike now.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.573
Jaffa!

20:05.684 --> 20:08.380
Hear me.

20:08.454 --> 20:11.890
I know your hearts
are prepared for battle...

20:11.957 --> 20:14.255
but I have come to ask
for your patience.

20:17.096 --> 20:19.496
You have prepared well
for the demise of Moloc...

20:19.565 --> 20:24.730
but only when allJaffa rise up as one
can the Goa'uld be defeated...

20:24.803 --> 20:30.036
and only then will all of our brothers
and sisters truly be free.

20:30.109 --> 20:33.101
This is the counsel
you have come to offer?

20:38.684 --> 20:41.710
- What is it?
- Down!

20:54.166 --> 20:55.633
Go.

21:28.067 --> 21:29.932
The gate is well guarded.

21:30.002 --> 21:33.665
We must return to the tent. If anyone
else survived, they will be tortured.

21:33.739 --> 21:35.730
- Wait.
- For what?

21:44.550 --> 21:48.077
- <i>Teal'c, you there?</i>
- Proceed, O'Neill.

21:48.153 --> 21:51.554
You know how I get
when you don't call.

21:51.624 --> 21:53.751
<i>Moloc's Jaffa ambushed the summit.</i>

21:53.826 --> 21:57.421
The address of the planet
must have fallen into the wrong hands.

21:57.496 --> 22:00.158
I am with Ishta and another
rebelJaffa named Aron.

22:00.232 --> 22:02.325
At present we are cut off
from the gate.

22:02.401 --> 22:04.426
- How bad?
- <i>Very.</i>

22:04.503 --> 22:07.370
- Backup?
- It would be unwise at the moment.

22:09.174 --> 22:13.008
I am uncertain as to the extent of forces
or if there are ships in orbit.

22:13.078 --> 22:16.411
I will need time to gather intel
before deciding on a course of action.

22:16.482 --> 22:19.781
<i>All right. I'll check in</i>
<i>in about an hour.</i>

22:20.853 --> 22:22.878
<i>And, T?</i>

22:22.955 --> 22:26.322
- My head is down, O'Neill.
- Over.

22:47.079 --> 22:49.673
Someone from within your camp
has betrayed you.

22:49.748 --> 22:51.909
That can be the only explanation
for Moloc's presence here.

22:51.984 --> 22:54.384
Teal'c, I do not have my tretonin.

22:54.453 --> 22:56.921
It was in my pack, and in our haste
I left it in the tent.

22:56.989 --> 22:59.355
I have enough for both of us.

23:02.795 --> 23:05.525
It must have shattered
when you fell to the ground.

23:05.597 --> 23:08.566
We must move.
A search patrol approaches.

23:10.536 --> 23:12.265
Indeed.

23:18.343 --> 23:20.277
You have no authority!

23:21.747 --> 23:24.272
Silence!

23:28.654 --> 23:30.986
Thank you.

23:31.056 --> 23:35.459
Now, Daniel,
what's going on here?

23:35.527 --> 23:38.121
The Tauri are unwilling to assist-

23:38.197 --> 23:40.392
Silence!

23:40.466 --> 23:43.401
I said Daniel.

23:43.469 --> 23:46.131
Well, as you can see,
everyone's a little upset.

23:46.205 --> 23:50.642
We will not abandon Ishta. We insist
a rescue mission be devised immediately.

23:50.709 --> 23:54.042
- We're devising.
- Teal'c said the gate is well guarded.

23:54.113 --> 23:56.411
Can we not acquire a ship
and journey to this planet?

23:56.482 --> 23:58.814
It would take at least
a week to get there.

23:58.884 --> 24:01.648
- Please return to your quarters.
- I cannot go until-

24:01.720 --> 24:05.383
Please! In time...

24:05.457 --> 24:09.655
your skills may be required
and you must be ready.

24:09.728 --> 24:10.820
Go.

24:25.544 --> 24:27.478
There are only six.

24:27.546 --> 24:31.710
We do not know how many more may be
hiding nearby, anticipating our approach.

24:34.787 --> 24:37.779
We must do something.

24:37.856 --> 24:41.292
I cannot bear this.
The Tauri have troops and weapons.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.761
We have not determined the size
of Moloc's forces they would face.

24:44.830 --> 24:48.857
Many more lives than
our own could be lost.

24:48.934 --> 24:51.425
Then what are we to do?

24:51.503 --> 24:53.994
For the moment, nothing.

25:06.852 --> 25:10.083
We cannot hide forever
from their patrols.

25:12.457 --> 25:14.391
We will rest here.

25:17.863 --> 25:19.854
They will not rest
until we are found.

25:19.932 --> 25:22.730
If your plan is to wait
until they give up and leave-

25:22.801 --> 25:26.464
I merely need to gather the information
I can concerning the forces against us.

25:27.773 --> 25:30.901
We're severely outnumbered.
What more do you need to know?

25:34.446 --> 25:36.641
I need to speak to Teal'c privately.

25:38.250 --> 25:41.981
- You do not trust my loyalty?
- I do.

25:42.054 --> 25:45.490
This is a private matter. Please.

25:55.100 --> 25:57.728
He could be the informant
as easily as anyone...

25:57.803 --> 26:01.398
and using this opportunity to gather
knowledge concerning the rebellion.

26:01.473 --> 26:06.172
I know, but he is right
about one thing.

26:06.245 --> 26:10.341
We cannot wait to act.
I am already growing weak.

26:11.583 --> 26:14.746
- You need rest.
- As do you.

26:16.321 --> 26:18.619
I will take first watch.

26:22.794 --> 26:26.821
I promised allJaffa under Moloc's rule...

26:26.899 --> 26:29.231
they will be free from his tyranny.

26:31.270 --> 26:33.795
And it was not a foolish promise.

26:33.872 --> 26:37.069
One day we will all be free.

26:37.142 --> 26:40.976
One day is not soon enough.

26:58.297 --> 27:00.788
Where is Ishta?

27:00.866 --> 27:03.232
It was her turn to take wa-

27:46.578 --> 27:48.512
Moloc is here.

27:55.821 --> 27:58.585
- We must act.
- I am aware.

27:58.657 --> 28:02.525
Even if Ishta cannot be saved, we must
take the opportunity to kill Moloc.

28:02.594 --> 28:04.994
- That is not my goal.
- It is mine...

28:05.063 --> 28:07.759
and that of all theJaffa
who have joined in rebellion against him.

28:07.833 --> 28:11.200
Without reinforcements,
we will be swarmed by Moloc's forces.

28:11.269 --> 28:13.533
I am willing to die for my cause.

28:13.605 --> 28:16.768
Then you will die for nothing if you
do not succeed in killing Moloc first.

28:16.842 --> 28:21.472
You are weak. Your mind
is clouded with feelings for Ishta.

28:27.419 --> 28:29.410
And you cannot be trusted.

28:37.662 --> 28:41.530
Ishta's been captured. Apparently,
Moloc is there in person.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.068
We're gonna coordinate a missile attack
on theJaffa at the gate...

28:44.136 --> 28:46.627
to provide a distraction
for Teal'c's rescue attempt.

28:46.705 --> 28:49.230
Moloc will certainly
kill her before surrendering.

28:49.307 --> 28:52.936
Well, Teal'c's more worried about what
he's gonna do to her in the meantime.

29:01.520 --> 29:04.956
It is not too late
to repent for your sins...

29:05.023 --> 29:08.584
grovel before your god
and beg for my forgiveness.

29:11.797 --> 29:14.732
Tell me of the other sinners
who would betray me.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.827
How many would renounce the privilege
of carrying the children of their god...

29:18.904 --> 29:20.098
like you?

29:22.407 --> 29:25.570
Tell me while their souls
may yet be saved.

29:28.947 --> 29:32.383
You cannot be Ishta of the Ha'ktyl.

29:33.819 --> 29:36.549
Wicked leader of the depraved!

29:39.558 --> 29:43.790
I sense nothing but weakness in you.
Or maybe that's what happens...

29:43.862 --> 29:47.059
when you abandon the strength
of the Goa'uld inside of you.

29:47.132 --> 29:51.762
All that is left is this
burning desire to die...

29:51.837 --> 29:55.329
at the hands of your
great and powerful god.

30:00.512 --> 30:03.413
We're preparing a UAV
to drop tretonin for Teal'c.

30:03.482 --> 30:06.974
He will need all his strength if he is to
rescue Ishta from the clutches of Moloc.

30:07.052 --> 30:10.385
The UAVwill then circle back
and paint the targets on the gate.

30:10.455 --> 30:12.446
Ishta did not exaggerate.

30:12.524 --> 30:15.823
The rebelJaffa on Moloc's worlds
are indeed a mighty force.

30:15.894 --> 30:19.352
As we speak, they prepare for war
against those still loyal to Moloc.

30:19.431 --> 30:21.797
You think they can win?

30:23.668 --> 30:25.101
I do not know.

30:25.170 --> 30:28.697
Even if they do, it's possible another
Goa'uld could simply take his place...

30:28.773 --> 30:32.869
or worse, come in and wipe them all out
to prove this rebellion is a bad idea.

30:32.944 --> 30:36.072
Indeed. That is something
we asked them to consider...

30:36.148 --> 30:39.117
and yet such reason
is beyond them now.

30:43.889 --> 30:45.686
UAV ready to launch, Colonel.

30:45.757 --> 30:48.317
Thank you, Sergeant.
Dial the gate.

31:05.544 --> 31:09.537
Launching UAV in three, two, one-

31:26.798 --> 31:28.459
Receiving Teal'c's radio signal.

31:35.140 --> 31:37.335
The UAV's been hit.

31:42.013 --> 31:43.241
<i>Teal'c, do you copy?</i>

31:44.249 --> 31:45.375
Proceed.

31:45.450 --> 31:49.250
<i>The UA Vshould be half a klick</i>
<i>southwest of your location.</i>

31:50.755 --> 31:53.315
- I am on my way.
- Be careful, Teal'c.

31:53.391 --> 31:55.552
We'll dial back in 30 minutes.

32:04.102 --> 32:06.263
Can we not still send
the missiles through?

32:06.338 --> 32:10.434
Without a laser-painted target,
they'd just fly out their fuel and crash.

32:51.416 --> 32:53.976
If you know who I am, brothers...

32:54.052 --> 32:58.785
you know that there is no need
to sacrifice your lives for a false god.

33:42.367 --> 33:45.700
It would have been easier
had you left me with a weapon.

33:55.347 --> 33:57.144
My thanks.

33:57.215 --> 34:00.048
Is there anything else
I can do to prove my loyalty?

34:03.188 --> 34:04.416
Indeed.

34:26.111 --> 34:28.136
Is this what you want?

34:29.781 --> 34:33.012
Evil serum to poison you further?

34:33.084 --> 34:37.020
Or will it give you strength
enough to last a little longer?

34:38.289 --> 34:39.551
Then take it.

34:41.826 --> 34:45.023
Take it so that you may have
more precious time with your god.

34:46.765 --> 34:50.098
My lord, word comes from Goronak.

34:51.336 --> 34:53.099
An uprising has begun.

34:53.171 --> 34:56.402
An army of 2,000
is marching on your temple.

34:56.474 --> 34:59.637
They control a garrison
of gliders and several Al'kesh.

35:01.246 --> 35:04.272
As I have foreseen.

35:04.349 --> 35:08.183
Your fleet of Ha'tak
have gathered themselves in orbit.

35:08.253 --> 35:12.189
They wait your command
to crush this insolence.

35:12.257 --> 35:14.418
I am done with this one.

35:14.492 --> 35:16.426
Trivial as it may seem...

35:16.494 --> 35:19.463
this little distraction has given me
a few moments of pleasure.

35:19.531 --> 35:23.661
Use her to capture the <i>shol'va</i> Teal'c.

35:24.969 --> 35:29.099
- Then bring him to me.
- Yes, my lord.

35:37.282 --> 35:41.116
When the gate opens again,
aim this at your target.

35:41.186 --> 35:44.053
The missiles will come through
and strike where you aim.

35:47.525 --> 35:50.153
You're certain your strength
has sufficiently returned?

35:50.228 --> 35:53.595
This time I will not be there
to come to your rescue.

35:53.665 --> 35:58.193
I assure you. This time
it will not be necessary.

36:05.477 --> 36:06.944
Open the <i>Chapa'ai.</i>

36:15.887 --> 36:18.117
<i>Jaffa kree noc!</i>

36:19.891 --> 36:21.825
Teal'c, this is Carter.
Do you read?

36:22.827 --> 36:24.886
Colonel Carter,
I am ready and in position.

36:24.963 --> 36:28.490
- So we're on?
- Indeed.

37:10.408 --> 37:12.808
She is weak to the point of death.

37:12.877 --> 37:16.438
Zatting us both,
even once, will kill her.

37:18.249 --> 37:19.580
Drop your weapon.

37:24.756 --> 37:26.018
Shoot them down!

37:41.172 --> 37:42.764
Drop it now!

37:46.844 --> 37:49.108
That is the sound
of your false god dying.

37:49.180 --> 37:51.740
- Gods cannot be killed.
- Teal'c.

37:52.984 --> 37:55.418
- Not another word.
- Shoot.

38:00.892 --> 38:03.725
There is no need.
I have taken mine.

38:07.398 --> 38:10.162
Is it true that Moloc is dead?

38:10.234 --> 38:13.795
If you have the strength,
we can see for ourselves.

38:20.211 --> 38:22.145
In a moment.

38:32.657 --> 38:36.889
Kar'yn, speak of your love
and devotion to Rya'c.

38:36.961 --> 38:41.523
Rya'c, your heart is pure
and your spirit strong.

38:41.599 --> 38:46.502
You give me strength...
and joy...

38:47.872 --> 38:52.332
and I will stand
by your side... always.

38:55.780 --> 39:01.650
Kar'yn, you are
as beautiful as the sun...

39:01.719 --> 39:04.279
and my love for you
is like the morning rays...

39:04.355 --> 39:06.846
that dawn over an endless day.

39:11.763 --> 39:13.924
The rite is complete.

39:13.998 --> 39:17.399
May you love and fight like warriors...

39:17.468 --> 39:19.732
just not with each other.

39:36.220 --> 39:39.121
A legend speaks of a place near
where the mountains meet the sea...

39:39.190 --> 39:41.420
of hidden pools
beneath majestic waterfalls.

39:41.492 --> 39:44.620
It is no legend.
I have seen it with my own eyes.

39:44.696 --> 39:48.029
You have chosen the location
for your <i>shim'roa</i> very well.

39:48.099 --> 39:51.500
Master Bra'tac said this is
where you took my mother.

39:51.569 --> 39:53.503
Indeed.

39:58.910 --> 40:02.107
I can think of no better mate
for you than Kar'yn...

40:02.180 --> 40:06.276
and I am certain your mother
would have felt the same.

40:07.952 --> 40:09.385
Thank you.

40:17.228 --> 40:20.994
Before your departure, there is
a matter that bears discussion.

40:21.065 --> 40:24.796
Father, I am aware of the ways
between a man and a woman.

40:24.869 --> 40:28.270
Good. Then you are prepared
for the rite of <i>ornoc.</i>

40:30.808 --> 40:32.776
Surely it's not still expected.

40:32.844 --> 40:35.005
On the first eve of <i>shim'roa.</i>

40:35.079 --> 40:37.809
My advice is that the knife
be as sharp as possible.

40:41.152 --> 40:43.245
Perhaps Kar'yn is right-

40:43.321 --> 40:47.121
not all of the old traditions
are worth holding on to.

40:51.028 --> 40:52.893
Indeed.

40:54.031 --> 40:56.090
And what of you and Ishta?

40:56.167 --> 40:57.828
What of us?

40:57.902 --> 41:00.462
Well, your relationship
would be much easier...

41:00.538 --> 41:02.631
if you both admit you are in love.

41:02.707 --> 41:04.504
For us all.

41:04.575 --> 41:09.478
Perhaps one day
when I am as wise as you.

41:16.220 --> 41:18.654
Once again we owe you our thanks...

41:18.723 --> 41:20.452
for your hospitality...

41:20.525 --> 41:23.358
and for helping us find yet
another new home world...

41:23.427 --> 41:25.554
where the children
of the Ha'ktyl may be safe.

41:25.630 --> 41:27.564
Think nothing of it.

41:29.433 --> 41:31.230
You sure you got everything?

41:31.302 --> 41:34.760
You didn't forget any kids...
or horses?

41:37.008 --> 41:39.169
May I speak with Teal'c alone?

41:39.243 --> 41:43.703
Sure. It's good to see you again.

41:47.518 --> 41:49.042
I will see you soon, Father.

41:54.559 --> 41:58.359
Yes, Father.

41:59.363 --> 42:01.490
Be well.

42:08.539 --> 42:12.339
I did not wish to spoil the days
of <i>shim'roa</i> for Rya'c and Kar'yn.

42:12.410 --> 42:14.241
What have you discovered?

42:14.312 --> 42:17.975
As you predicted, another Goa'uld
has claimed the domain of Moloc.

42:18.049 --> 42:21.075
- Ba'al.
- Yes.

42:23.287 --> 42:25.380
Do not wait too long to visit.

42:25.456 --> 42:27.583
We have a war to plan...

42:27.658 --> 42:29.751
among other things.
