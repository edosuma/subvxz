01:20.320 --> 01:21.800
Wanna hear my song?

01:21.880 --> 01:25.640
♪ I am beautiful in every single way ♪

01:25.720 --> 01:29.120
♪ Yes, words can't bring me down ♪

01:29.200 --> 01:31.720
♪ Oh, no ♪

01:31.800 --> 01:33.120
Hi, I'm Brichelle.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.080
- Hello.
- How are you?

01:35.160 --> 01:38.720
Brichelle! You back the fuck off!

01:39.920 --> 01:42.480
She got impulse-control issues, you know?

01:42.560 --> 01:45.480
I'm real smart. I know
the whole periodic chart.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.200
I love science!

01:47.280 --> 01:49.880
Okay, Tasha, how about we
get you a shaved ice, yes?

01:49.960 --> 01:51.080
What flavor would you like?

01:51.160 --> 01:52.440
- But I was...
- Tasha.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.080
Blue.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.800
That looks vile.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.720
It look blue, but it tastes like red.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.520
Blue and red are colors,
darlin'. They're not flavors.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.000
Well, it's tasty. I
like me somethin' tasty.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.080
Especially on days like now.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.520
People only want the babies.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.640
Of course they want the
babies. Babies are cute.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.000
I'm cute.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.800
No, you're big, and your hair's ratsy.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.560
And you're too eager and too dark.

02:30.640 --> 02:34.640
And now your mouth is blue, but
I suppose it tastes like red.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.880
You nasty.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.160
Mmm-hmm.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.960
I just call 'em like I see 'em, darlin'.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.480
Your group home in this neighborhood?

02:45.560 --> 02:47.320
How you know I live in a group home?

02:55.560 --> 02:58.480
My dear boy, this feels light to me.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.480
Light ain't right unless you
like sleeping on the street.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.360
Nah, it ain't light. It's just big bills.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.280
Well, then, I'll see you
at home for dinner, baby.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.640
Aw, shit, you a connect.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.800
I'm a businesswoman.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.280
I couldn't help hear you braggin'
on your science back there.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.600
I'm impressed.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.800
I also know pi.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.600
Your ass tells me you know pie.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.400
Pi. Not "pie".

03:29.480 --> 03:31.400
Up to 56 digits.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.680
You care to learn the trade?

03:32.760 --> 03:36.520
Hell, no, not with no connect.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.960
I get in trouble, I never
find a forever family.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.480
You might wanna start thinkin' about
making your own forever family, Taystee.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.920
You wait around for one to come
along, you might die waitin'.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.400
My name is Tasha.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.320
Yeah, but Taystee suits you somehow.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.840
Like you said, everybody
like a little somethin' tasty.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.120
I'll be keepin' my eye
on you, Taystee Girl.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.160
See you around the way.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.320
This is sweet!

04:06.400 --> 04:09.280
Yo, I'd rock this if I
wasn't being all professional.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.680
Why you care? You know it's all bullshit.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.680
Bullshit or no, I wanna win!

04:13.760 --> 04:17.120
Ladies, it's about making
a good first impression.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.320
You got anything in white? My
mother always said that was my color.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.720
Ugh! I mean, you could smell
every inmate that's ever worn this.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.800
You ever wash this shit?

04:24.880 --> 04:27.280
You got something for the
larger woman? Big and beautiful?

04:27.360 --> 04:30.600
We have plus size on the end there.

04:31.760 --> 04:34.440
Aw, shit. Man, I don't wanna wear no sack.

04:34.520 --> 04:37.760
I got curves. I'm a plushious woman.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.280
If this is really about
career dressing for us,

04:40.360 --> 04:43.600
shouldn't this be all, like,
McDonald's and maids' uniforms?

04:43.680 --> 04:45.320
No! Do not think small.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.840
We are dressing ourselves
for the career that we want.

04:48.920 --> 04:52.200
You have to put it into the
universe, dress for success.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.600
Take the leopard.

04:53.680 --> 04:57.960
Oh, I didn't see the
leopard! Ooh, that's cute.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.080
What if I wanna be,
like, a marine biologist?

05:01.160 --> 05:02.520
You got a wet suit?

05:02.600 --> 05:06.200
If you want to apply for
a job in marine biology,

05:06.280 --> 05:08.720
you might have to go to
an office for an interview.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.720
- Ha!
- What about this?

05:11.760 --> 05:15.000
The peach tones would look
so good with your skin.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.960
Could somebody help zip me, please?

05:18.040 --> 05:19.920
I don't think that's gonna work.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
You callin' me fat?

05:21.080 --> 05:25.160
No. I'm just saying that
you're... yeah, you're broad.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.560
You're like a broad broad.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.200
She a broad somethin.'

05:30.280 --> 05:31.600
And you a bitch somethin.'

05:32.920 --> 05:35.200
I'm gonna pull in this side here.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.840
- Careful. Careful.
- And you pull in that side.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.520
And someone's gotta get the zipper.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.200
- Okay, we can do this.
- Okay.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.400
I'll do the zipper. Let's
go. Suck it in, girl.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.440
I am sucking.

05:44.520 --> 05:45.800
Fuck.

05:46.920 --> 05:47.880
Oh, God.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.800
How's it look?

05:50.880 --> 05:52.200
Like I don't wanna be anywhere near you

05:52.280 --> 05:55.520
when those beads pop off
and shoot people in the face.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.080
Out of curiosity,

05:59.160 --> 06:01.640
what kind of job were you
thinking of gettin' in that?

06:01.720 --> 06:03.200
I'm just here playin' dress-up.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.800
Ladies, you better get movin.'

06:05.880 --> 06:08.520
We're walkin' over to
that chapel in 10 minutes.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.680
I don't have anything.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.760
Hey, can I ask you something?

06:13.800 --> 06:16.520
What would you wear if you
were going to a job interview

06:16.600 --> 06:18.760
at a medical supply company in Utica?

06:18.840 --> 06:20.760
Just hypothetically speaking.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.600
How come Flaca gets to do
job fair and we're stuck here?

06:24.680 --> 06:25.720
'Cause Flaca asked first,

06:25.800 --> 06:27.720
and if I let everybody
go, nobody would be here.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.320
Next time, ask first.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.400
She don't even need job fair.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.360
Her boyfriend's like the king of molly.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.120
He be selling to every
club kid in New York.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
That shit is blowing up.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.320
What's molly?

06:37.400 --> 06:40.560
The pure powder form of MDMA.

06:40.640 --> 06:44.440
Supposed to be like a clean ecstasy,
but it made me grind my teeth.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.400
How come you ain't in jail, Luschek?

06:46.480 --> 06:50.120
I am in jail, every fuckin' day.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.280
You want the radiator on or off?

06:51.360 --> 06:52.840
Off. It's hot enough in here.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.360
And freezing everywhere else.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.400
The pipes in our bathroom froze
again, how about deal with that?

06:58.480 --> 06:59.720
I'm not a plumber.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.880
Oh, our mistake, you got that
whole ass-crack thing going, so...

07:05.680 --> 07:08.520
Inmate, you want me to give you a shot?

07:08.600 --> 07:10.920
Hey, have a job fair brownie.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.720
Maria, stop running your
mouth and run the dishwasher.

07:18.760 --> 07:22.120
Daya? Ven, I've got something for you.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.280
Thank God. I'm dying.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.280
Is this gonna work?

07:26.360 --> 07:27.840
It should. Drink up, mami.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.240
What are you giving her over there?

07:33.400 --> 07:34.400
It's nothing.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.840
It's to help her poop. She's backed up.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.400
Why didn't you tell me?

07:38.480 --> 07:40.800
- You don't wanna hear about my bathroom.
- Of course I do.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.040
Okay, Aleida.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.960
I haven't shit for five days, you happy?

07:46.040 --> 07:47.040
Ugh!

07:48.000 --> 07:49.200
Thank you, Gloria.

07:53.880 --> 07:54.880
What do you think you're doing?

07:54.960 --> 07:56.200
Oh, man, relax.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.680
It's prune juice, olive
oil, a little magic.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.240
It's not gonna hurt the baby.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.920
You're not her mother, I'm her mother.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.560
I think right now you're
more like her aunt.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.640
Uh-uh, no.

08:05.720 --> 08:08.680
I didn't get me a belly full of
stretch marks to be no fucking tía.

08:08.760 --> 08:13.160
Look, relax, she came
to me, I helped her out.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.520
She's comfortable with me.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.480
Yeah, too comfortable.

08:18.480 --> 08:24.080
So, as you can see, we have a very
exciting few days planned for all of you.

08:24.160 --> 08:28.520
And now to start things off,
here from Dress for Success,

08:28.600 --> 08:33.320
to give you some dos and don'ts
of interview dressing, Mrs. Sackin.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.560
Thank you.

08:39.640 --> 08:45.320
Dress for Success is the premier support
network for today's unemployed woman.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.360
Let us begin our journey. Ladies?

08:47.440 --> 08:48.640
Oh!

09:01.400 --> 09:03.280
Okay, right away, what do we see?

09:03.640 --> 09:06.600
That a cocktail dress is
not proper interview attire.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.560
This is not corporate or even daytime wear.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.360
- Nope.
- Wholly unprofessional.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.480
I'm just showing off my assets.

09:15.800 --> 09:20.520
Next, I'm going to say
leopard, little sailor girl,

09:20.600 --> 09:24.640
and our friend in peach here are also
not properly attired for an interview.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.840
The animal print is too racy
and implies poor judgment,

09:28.920 --> 09:31.880
and the sailor outfit is childish.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.720
- Companies are looking to hire adults.
- Adults.

09:34.800 --> 09:39.120
And finally, the peach is simply
ill-fitting, dated, and not flattering.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.000
- But you told me to wear it.
- Yeah, you did.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.840
I just wanna swim with dolphins.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.080
Thank you, you can leave the stage now.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.480
Okay, let's look at
what's going right up here.

09:49.560 --> 09:54.000
This is a good interview outfit.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.520
It fits her well.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.800
The dark stockings give it a
conservative, polished finish.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.840
I believe the makeup is a
bit gothic and heavy-handed,

10:02.920 --> 10:04.920
but overall the look is solid.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.120
That's right, solid.

10:09.640 --> 10:13.640
Another strong ensemble we
have is the pantsuit and blouse.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.200
It's classic.

10:16.400 --> 10:21.640
However, we do run into some serious
problems with personal grooming here.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.680
Huh?

10:22.760 --> 10:26.120
The hair, it's messy, unpolished, unkempt.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.240
- My hair is clean.
- It's wild and slovenly.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.280
I'm sorry it's not uptight and boring!

10:30.360 --> 10:36.320
But here, the hair is nicely coiffed,
the makeup is subtle and understated.

10:36.400 --> 10:40.520
However, the shirt is too sheer,
and the skirt is too tight.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.360
Uh-uh, hold up. Pause.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.920
At job fair last year, this was the
winnin' outfit. I seen it myself.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.280
That's why I picked it instead of the
blue dress I know I'd look bangin' in.

10:50.360 --> 10:54.440
Let's talk a moment about dressing
for your body type and your skin tone.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.840
A fuller-figured woman might wanna
choose a looser-fitting garment,

10:58.920 --> 11:02.400
perhaps a dress as opposed
to a shirt and a skirt.

11:02.480 --> 11:06.880
Not as loose as this, which
resembles a large burlap muumuu.

11:06.960 --> 11:07.920
No shit.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.160
But something in a jewel
tone with a contrasting scarf.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.280
- I know I look good.
- Man, I still look hella office.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.800
I walk in, they be like,
"Yeah, she know her business".

11:17.880 --> 11:19.320
Yeah!

11:21.400 --> 11:23.120
So, who wins?

11:23.200 --> 11:25.440
Overall, despite the excessive eye makeup,

11:25.520 --> 11:28.240
I would have to give it to
this young lady right here.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.880
That's right, Latina, we the winna.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.480
Man, you gave it to Franken-cha-cha?

11:36.560 --> 11:39.920
This is some bullshit, shit to the bull.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.160
Damn, that Kool take
you out to dinner first?

11:48.240 --> 11:50.360
Man, you sound just like Marsha.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.400
You know she right there in that kitchen.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.880
Like I care. Only got two
weeks left in this shit hole.

11:55.960 --> 11:59.760
Little girl, you look like a dragon with
all that smoke coming out of your nose.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.960
Please, you smoke like
a hooptie's tailpipe,

12:02.040 --> 12:03.560
puffin' up and down the street.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.040
I'm an adult, it gives me
the right to make bad choices.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.040
We heading over to Rayleen's for
something delicious. Care to join us?

12:12.120 --> 12:13.440
I gotta work.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.040
Well, we working, too, except our work
doesn't leave us smelling like rancid oil.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.320
Yeah, you clean as a drug-dealin' whistle.

12:20.640 --> 12:24.120
You should decline an offer by
simply saying, "No, thank you."

12:24.200 --> 12:27.880
Otherwise, people will
stop inviting you to things.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.360
I could eat.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.280
Well, come on, then,
let's nourish that body.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.560
Bye-bye, Taystee Girl.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.400
Sure you not tryin' to
come out and eat, though?

12:46.480 --> 12:48.120
No, RJ, I gotta get to work.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.400
All right, be safe, though.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.320
Is the chicken flavor Cup
of Noodles back in stock,

13:01.400 --> 13:03.320
or have you only got the shrimp?

13:03.400 --> 13:04.880
We got cream of chicken.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.160
No, I don't like that one.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.240
You want shrimpy?

13:08.320 --> 13:10.680
Sure, I'll take five of those,

13:10.760 --> 13:14.520
and I don't want the tuna with
the spicy sauce, just plain tuna.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.600
Oh, and for the coffee,
the dark roast, please.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.680
How's the fitness going, O'Neill?

13:20.760 --> 13:24.680
I'm in the forty-seven hundreds.
Over 10,000 steps a day.

13:24.760 --> 13:29.600
You'll make it easy, it's
still early, and good for you.

13:29.680 --> 13:30.680
One step at a time.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.320
- Uh-oh, problem.
- What kind of problem?

13:33.400 --> 13:35.760
No-money-in-account problem.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.400
What are you talking about?

13:41.800 --> 13:45.000
Call your family. I can't sell you shit.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.800
Sorry, next!

13:53.040 --> 13:55.520
Do you understand what
this is doing to my plants?

13:55.600 --> 13:57.760
There was frost on my succulent.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.920
This is a desert plant,
it should not be freezing.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.520
Look, the furnace needs to be replaced.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.600
I could dickpaw it all day.
It's never getting hot again.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.480
Mmm, like your mother.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.400
Ah, delightful, a "your
mama" joke? That's priceless.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.480
What did Fig say?

14:11.560 --> 14:14.000
What do you think? She
hiked up her skirt...

14:14.080 --> 14:15.040
Yeah.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.160
told me to Band-Aid the old heap

14:16.240 --> 14:18.960
and gave me 50 bucks to buy
a space heater for her office.

14:19.040 --> 14:22.160
And you ran off like a good little
puppy and you did it for her.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.760
Joke's on her.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.840
Space heater cost 27 bucks,
that's 23 bucks profit, man.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.320
That's dinner for two at Sizzler.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.080
Here's $4.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.600
Add it to the 23.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.360
Buy me one of those space
heaters, or I'm gonna rat you out.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.080
No Sizzler for you.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.480
Shit.

14:44.480 --> 14:48.000
Don't forget, ladies, your
usual meal is 1,500 calories.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.040
Beware of overeating.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.200
Hey, where's your doggy?

14:51.280 --> 14:52.800
Um...

14:54.440 --> 14:57.640
Look what I got, look what I
got. That's right, that's right.

14:57.720 --> 15:01.480
Oh! You love that, don't you? Yeah, yeah.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.120
You just lick, lick, lick. You
like peanut butter, don't you?

15:04.200 --> 15:07.880
You like to lick that, don't
you? Oh, just lick, lick, lick.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.200
Lick.

15:13.800 --> 15:14.760
Lick.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.560
It got weird.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.320
Oh, okay.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.400
Look who's here.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.840
Should I tell Gloria?

15:28.920 --> 15:31.200
Nah, a few weeks ago, Gloria
said the roja could eat,

15:31.280 --> 15:33.200
but she just never came in till now.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.240
Why'd she let her off the hook?

15:35.320 --> 15:38.000
Well, you got to figure,
she lost her kitchen,

15:38.080 --> 15:41.840
she lost her girls, and
her hair is all fucked up.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.840
Let her have some shitty
food and get on with her life.

15:44.920 --> 15:45.920
If it was up to me,

15:46.000 --> 15:47.840
_

15:47.920 --> 15:49.480
That's a bear.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.920
_

15:51.000 --> 15:51.960
_

15:52.040 --> 15:54.320
she's hibernating until
she gets strong again

15:54.400 --> 15:57.000
_

15:57.080 --> 15:58.120
and she's gonna shred up

15:58.200 --> 16:02.720
_

16:03.680 --> 16:05.520
What the fuck do you know about bears?

16:05.600 --> 16:08.280
What, you live by the
Bronx Zoo or somethin'?

16:22.280 --> 16:23.240
_

16:23.320 --> 16:24.560
You can see it in her eyes.

16:24.640 --> 16:25.960
You're full of shit.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.200
No, Daya's the one who's full of shit.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.480
It's true.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.440
It's not funny right now,
I'm not in a good way.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.320
She's right, it's our "doodie"
not to make fun of her.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.160
Yeah, 'cause that would be crappy.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.600
You guys are such assholes.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.640
At least these assholes
are working. Oh, snap!

16:44.880 --> 16:49.000
Inmate Martinez, report for an
assignment at the laundry detail.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.560
Ook-lay oo's-hay ere-hay.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.080
Subtle, Morello.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.320
It's just still throwing me, you know?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.440
Not seeing her in her
chef's jacket, you know?

16:59.520 --> 17:00.840
Mmm.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.640
It's like when you see a cop
in sweat pants in your kitchen

17:03.720 --> 17:05.520
after he's spent the
night with your sister.

17:06.840 --> 17:11.000
Little splooge on the sweat
pants, and you feel weird about it.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.120
She said she's seeing some shit.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.200
Oh.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.680
She's high as a kite on psych meds.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.000
That's too bad.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.160
Care to join us?

17:37.240 --> 17:38.560
No, thanks.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.600
Happy here, nice and quiet, but thank you.

17:42.680 --> 17:43.960
Suit yourself.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.240
There she is.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.120
Penn.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.360
Hi.

18:03.440 --> 18:07.080
We didn't think we were ever
gonna see you again, what happened?

18:07.160 --> 18:09.240
Last thing I remember is I was an angel.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.320
Well, I heard y'all beat the
holy mess out of each other.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.680
Yeah, I mean, I suppose
she got a few licks in.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.400
Well, talk to you later.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.160
I understand.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.720
Would you like to dance?

18:43.360 --> 18:44.960
Hey, Fischer, how you doing?

18:45.040 --> 18:47.880
Fine, sir, thanks for asking,
back in the swing of things.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.560
Good to hear. Doggett, take a seat.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.520
Would you close the door, please?

18:55.040 --> 18:57.000
So, out of the penalty box, huh?

18:57.080 --> 18:58.800
I'm sorry, what?

18:58.880 --> 19:01.240
Nothing. Penalty box. Hockey?

19:01.320 --> 19:06.120
No, no, no. No hockey, Mr.
Healy. I've been in SHU.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.480
It's been like a month, I
think, right? A month? Yeah.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.440
So they just pulled me
out, said I was back.

19:13.640 --> 19:14.840
Am I back?

19:14.920 --> 19:16.200
For now.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.800
I suppose you're wondering
why I called you down here.

19:19.800 --> 19:24.120
Uh, counseling? Make sure
I don't go cuckoo again?

19:25.760 --> 19:28.840
I won't. I got all my marbles back.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.360
I thought we should talk.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.200
Get things straight.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.840
All right.

19:40.760 --> 19:45.840
I mean, I can promise you that I've
never felt more saner than I do now.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.440
You know, when you spend that
much time down there in solitude,

19:52.800 --> 19:56.840
it's like real purification.
You know, my heart feels right.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.480
I suppose you had time to
reflect on that evening, then?

20:02.600 --> 20:06.600
Nope, because my head is so fuzzy.

20:06.680 --> 20:07.960
Oh? Is that so?

20:09.080 --> 20:13.440
I mean, I suffered
multiple contusions and...

20:14.920 --> 20:18.280
lacerations, and it's
just freakin' painful,

20:18.360 --> 20:21.080
and now that I got through it,

20:21.160 --> 20:26.000
I started to remember, and then
lots of stuff came back to me.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.040
Yep.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.320
She angered you, you
confronted her, and you fought.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.400
Yes.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.760
That's it, end of story.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.440
No, there's more.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.640
What more?

20:45.480 --> 20:46.840
What are you talking about?

20:46.920 --> 20:49.800
There's, like, angles, and there's,
like, extenuations and then there's...

20:49.880 --> 20:52.120
I didn't know what I was seeing, Doggett.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.280
Do you hear what I'm saying?

20:56.360 --> 20:59.040
I had no idea that you two were gonna...

21:01.080 --> 21:06.280
You could have been having a talk, a
lovers' quarrel, even, I don't know,

21:06.360 --> 21:08.240
and I certainly didn't see a weapon.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.200
Holiday times, tensions get high.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.760
I mean, God knows Katya
was testier than ever then,

21:12.840 --> 21:14.440
but don't think for a second

21:14.520 --> 21:17.640
that anyone is gonna believe a
meth-addled hillbilly over me.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.880
Be 100% fucking clear about that.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.040
Well, they might just...

21:31.680 --> 21:36.320
believe the poster girl for
the right-to-life movement.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.640
You know, I was on Greta Van Susteren,

21:38.720 --> 21:42.880
and what if they knew you were
about to let me get killed?

21:44.360 --> 21:46.920
I ought to throw you back
in seg and let you rot.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.000
What would help you forget
what you think you saw?

21:56.960 --> 21:57.920
Mmm.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.920
Uh, I'm still not sure how that answers
the questions I have regarding the budget.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.400
That's why I invited you today.

22:03.480 --> 22:07.320
Programs like Dress for
Success, our job fair,

22:07.400 --> 22:09.920
our Christmas pageant, Readers to Readers,

22:10.000 --> 22:15.240
are not a top priority for the DOC,
but they are so important for morale,

22:15.320 --> 22:19.520
for education, for rehabilitation.

22:19.600 --> 22:23.080
Until we can get the government
on board for some serious reform,

22:23.160 --> 22:25.920
a little shifting of funds is a necessity,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.640
but I assure you all of
the money is being used

22:28.720 --> 22:31.840
for the good of the
prison and its residents.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.080
Okay.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.920
And I noticed that your husband
is running for state senate.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.080
Is your passion for
education a value he shares?

22:42.160 --> 22:43.360
Absolutely.

22:43.440 --> 22:48.280
Uh, but any questions you have for
Jason, you can direct towards his office.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.760
I hope I've shed some
light on how the money

22:52.840 --> 22:56.280
is being used to benefit the
inmates here at Litchfield.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.360
Uh, well, actually, I've
got a few more questions...

22:58.440 --> 23:01.720
Because I'm afraid, sadly,
I have to get back to work.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.040
Prison doesn't run itself.

23:08.280 --> 23:11.760
I mean, she gave me the freakin'
outfit. It was one big setup.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.440
So now the two black girls,
the lesbo junkie girl,

23:14.520 --> 23:17.280
and some Mexican get to go
on and do the interview part,

23:17.360 --> 23:19.000
and I'm back here.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.800
Well, your makeup looks real pretty.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.720
Like, I didn't even know
you had eyelashes till today.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.160
You look really nice.

23:24.240 --> 23:27.160
Thanks, Ange. That's nice of you to say.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.480
Hey, did you know that Penn's out of seg?

23:30.560 --> 23:32.520
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.040
How do you know?

23:34.120 --> 23:37.560
'Cause I seen her, after lunch,
walking to Healy's office.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.160
How'd she look?

23:39.240 --> 23:41.480
She looked pretty rough.

23:41.560 --> 23:45.880
I mean, if her teeth was bad before?
Woof, ain't much left in there.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.200
Guard Thompson to the tower.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.280
Don't get me wrong or nothin,
' but since she's been away,

23:53.360 --> 23:56.360
hasn't it been, like, kind of nice in here?

23:56.440 --> 23:58.200
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, like...

23:59.640 --> 24:02.440
like, peaceful, easy.

24:02.520 --> 24:05.040
No yelling, no telling everyone
they're going to hell, just...

24:06.160 --> 24:08.480
Just quiet, you know?

24:08.560 --> 24:09.600
Yeah.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.320
But you won't tell her
I said nothing, right?

24:13.400 --> 24:14.360
'Course not.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.840
Ladies, check the board
for work assignments.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.280
So, where's Piper now?

24:29.720 --> 24:31.160
Still in Chicago, I imagine it.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.280
Larry, I wanted to talk about you, not her.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.200
She staying there? In Chicago?

24:35.280 --> 24:37.520
She hates deep-dish.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.680
Don't know if she's staying.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.920
Don't think she's eating
a whole lot of pizza.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.720
- Larry...
- How'd she seem to you?

24:42.800 --> 24:46.120
Seemed like an idiot to me. I gave
her advice, and she didn't take it.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.720
You gave her love, and she cheated on
you. I'm not a fan, and end of topic.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.480
- I miss her.
- Well, then, find a distraction, son,

24:53.560 --> 24:56.920
something that doesn't involve
moping around, eating crap

24:57.000 --> 24:59.600
- and playing that World of Warlock.
- Warcraft.

24:59.680 --> 25:00.760
Warcraft, perfect.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.320
You can join the tank
corps, another waste of time.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.360
Go get laid.

25:04.440 --> 25:07.120
- I'm not ready.
- For what?

25:07.200 --> 25:10.160
For sticking your dick in something
new and cute and moving it around?

25:10.240 --> 25:11.880
All guys are ready for that.

25:11.960 --> 25:15.000
These two over here are
ready for it any moment now.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.280
Get on with your life.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.760
You're right. No, you're right.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.080
She cheated, right? I mean...

25:38.200 --> 25:40.880
She lied, why am I holding on?

25:40.960 --> 25:42.880
Prison changed her. It changes people.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.000
- I heard that.
- I mean, she was not a lesbian anymore,

25:45.080 --> 25:46.040
not with me.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.560
You know? Then she's in prison, what,
a few weeks? Bam! A lesbian again.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.160
Or bi? I don't even know.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.840
It was good with us, I know it was.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.920
I think, shit, I mean,
what if that was a lie, too?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.120
But I don't think it was, I
don't think it was, I mean,

26:01.200 --> 26:05.280
you know, I know I have some talent,
I'm very attentive and thorough,

26:05.360 --> 26:07.880
you know, I do good work, I'm not small.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.960
- Larry.
- You're right, I should get out there.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.800
I need to get out there.
I'm gonna get out there.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.240
I made her come vaginally, do
you know how hard that is to do?

26:14.320 --> 26:15.720
- Please, Larry.
- My point is...

26:15.800 --> 26:19.160
I don't even know what my point is anymore.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.240
- Dad?
- Yeah?

26:29.320 --> 26:31.520
Why did you bring us to a gay bathhouse?

26:32.760 --> 26:36.320
It's a nice place, clean.
A shvitz is a shvitz.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.840
- I had a Groupon.
- Ah, gotcha.

26:41.920 --> 26:45.160
Wait, so, I could put
that on my résumé thing?

26:45.240 --> 26:46.440
- Workin' for my cousin?
- Sure.

26:46.520 --> 26:53.160
But instead of saying that you helped
make sure that no one stole shit,

26:54.120 --> 26:59.560
you could say that you monitored
inventory and provided security.

26:59.640 --> 27:03.880
Ah, okay, okay, I see
that, I could do that.

27:03.960 --> 27:07.360
I want the kind of job where
I could just chill, you know?

27:07.440 --> 27:09.200
Chill out, collect a check.

27:09.280 --> 27:13.760
According to this aptitude test,
I should be a professional athlete,

27:13.840 --> 27:17.440
a park ranger, or a correctional officer.

27:17.520 --> 27:21.040
Working at Storky's means I have
experience in the food service industry.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.160
That's it.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.560
And because I can remember
shit and add real fast,

27:24.640 --> 27:27.840
I have high retention abilities
and exceptional math skills.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.880
You're getting it.

27:28.960 --> 27:33.440
Well, I just wanna get married
to Christopher and have his babies

27:33.520 --> 27:35.440
and make the house look nice.

27:35.520 --> 27:41.040
Maybe in the sunshine, like on the beach,
surrounded by, mmm, beautiful people.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.360
Are you at all aware that you
just told an inmate in prison

27:45.440 --> 27:47.360
that she should become
a correctional officer?

27:48.560 --> 27:49.680
What the fuck is wrong with you?

27:49.760 --> 27:51.480
I do want to be a professional athlete,

27:51.560 --> 27:53.480
but you just don't snap
your fingers and become that.

27:53.560 --> 27:57.120
I was hoping to work with
mentally ill children.

27:58.080 --> 28:01.640
I think I could offer some insight
into what they might be experiencing

28:01.720 --> 28:03.600
and help them to heal and recover.

28:04.560 --> 28:07.720
Maybe I'll Pinterest.
I hear that's a thing.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.840
I went from wearing a habit
to wearing a prison uniform.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.080
I don't think the fashion industry
would be a viable option for me.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.880
I would also like to
work with round objects.

28:19.360 --> 28:23.360
Yeah, round things are very pleasing to me.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.160
Maybe I can umpire women's softball.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.480
Then I could get laid.

28:26.560 --> 28:30.040
So I also can rhyme real
good. What do I say about that?

28:30.120 --> 28:31.480
Poetic inclinations.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.560
Ha!

28:33.640 --> 28:37.920
That's what I'm talking about! See,
you and me, we gonna be friends!

28:38.000 --> 28:41.320
Yeah, give it to me! Give it to me!
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.440
Now let's keep going.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.400
Vasily, what happened to your face?

28:46.480 --> 28:48.360
Did Ganya's people do that to you?

28:48.440 --> 28:51.800
No. No, Ma. Lida hit me in
the face with a bag of change.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.000
What?

28:53.080 --> 28:56.040
She has this bag of quarters for
the laundry sitting on the table.

28:56.120 --> 28:59.000
I stumbled in late a little
drunk. She grabbed it, and whack.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.080
Good for her.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.840
Yeah, I appreciate your
sympathy, Ma, thank you.

29:02.920 --> 29:05.720
I didn't raise you to come
home drunk and upset your wife.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.760
She's not my wife.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.840
She's the mother of my
grandson, what should I call her?

29:08.920 --> 29:11.200
A violent criminal who hurt your baby boy.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.560
- This hurts, Ma.
- Why won't you marry her?

29:13.640 --> 29:16.040
She's a nice girl, she puts up with you.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.160
I have a fear of commitment.

29:17.240 --> 29:20.000
Okay, mamochka, why don't we
talk about you for a little bit?

29:20.080 --> 29:23.800
Because my life is sad and small
and a burden to those I love.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.240
Papa didn't put any money
in the account this month.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.720
- What's going on?
- Wanna know what's going on?

29:31.800 --> 29:33.640
Ma, the store is empty, okay?

29:33.720 --> 29:36.960
Everyone's afraid to go in because
they know Ganya's mad at you and Pop

29:37.040 --> 29:38.240
for blowing the prison contract.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.600
I got him that contract in the first place.

29:40.680 --> 29:44.400
Yeah? Well, maybe you should remind him,
because he doesn't remember that part.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.880
Why didn't Papa come?

29:45.960 --> 29:47.960
He's at the store all day, half the night,

29:48.040 --> 29:50.120
he just sits there, waiting
for someone to come in.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.280
He's got no help, Ma.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.520
- So, why don't you help him?
- Ma, I'm working. I got a family, too.

29:54.600 --> 29:57.320
Don't you think I wish I can go
there and help him out some more?

29:57.400 --> 29:59.520
You know, maybe I should've
gone to college like you said.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.960
- What about Yuri and Maxim?
- We're all working. We're all hustling.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.840
We're all trying to avoid
crazy women with weapons, okay?

30:05.920 --> 30:08.680
It's just rough times right now.
I'm gonna put some things together.

30:08.760 --> 30:11.240
I'll get you money next week, I promise.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.360
Thank you.

30:13.480 --> 30:18.160
You're a good son. Not
great, but pretty good.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.360
I'll take it.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.040
God, she already looks so different.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.240
- Yeah.
- Hello!

30:25.320 --> 30:27.960
Yeah, that's right, I'm your mommy!

30:28.040 --> 30:32.760
And I love you so, so, so much!

30:32.840 --> 30:37.000
And soon we're gonna be spending
lots of time together, I promise.

30:37.080 --> 30:41.080
Before you can even remember
stuff, we're gonna be together.

30:42.320 --> 30:46.920
When is that? When you can remember?
Like, when you're four or five, right?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.760
I think I remember something
from when I was four.

30:49.840 --> 30:50.800
Don't know.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.440
Her head smells so good.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.520
And she looks like you,
you know, but pretty.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.000
Is she a good baby?

31:01.080 --> 31:04.120
- Does she sleep okay? Is she eating?
- Yeah.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.000
- It's so good talking to you.
- Yeah.

31:12.520 --> 31:15.520
See, I ain't worried. I'm
gonna rock that interview,

31:15.600 --> 31:17.560
then I'm gonna be the
winner of the job fair

31:17.640 --> 31:19.640
and they gonna hook me up with a real job.

31:19.720 --> 31:24.240
I'm gonna be like an assistant to Judge
Joe Brown or one of them TV judges.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.920
Or maybe even Judy.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.360
Yeah, man, she don't take shit from nobody!

31:28.440 --> 31:30.120
I know we'd vibe.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.200
Yo, what the fuck are you
talkin' about, real job?

31:32.280 --> 31:34.520
Last year, the girl who did the best,

31:34.600 --> 31:38.280
the job fair people hooked her up
with a real job once she was released.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.000
They don't announce it or nothing
'cause people get all crazy,

31:41.080 --> 31:42.680
but she told me on the low-low.

31:42.760 --> 31:46.280
- Wait, who won last year?
- Pocano.

31:46.360 --> 31:49.280
- Ocampo?
- The Filipino chick with the mole?

31:49.360 --> 31:50.360
Ocampo.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.000
Man, the one that worked in the woodshop.

31:52.080 --> 31:55.320
She won for best outfit,
and she had the best résumé.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.240
Why didn't you tell us there was a prize?

31:57.320 --> 32:00.200
Man, why you think? We are the competition.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.240
Now we out the way, so it's just
her and the little skinny Mexican

32:03.320 --> 32:04.360
doing the interview tomorrow.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.560
Man, that shit ain't right,
man, you should've told us.

32:06.640 --> 32:10.200
But I'm a child of the system, no
one ever taught me right from wrong.

32:10.280 --> 32:11.400
Girl, fuck you!

32:11.480 --> 32:14.480
Like you would've did
better in your potato sack?

32:17.320 --> 32:20.440
Man, I got a chance here, and
I'm doing it for all of us.

32:21.600 --> 32:25.000
Man, come on! I need y'all rootin' for me.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.160
We can't let Skinny Bean win.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.720
They already got the kitchen,

32:28.800 --> 32:30.320
and they got the best seats at movie night.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.360
- True.
- True.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.280
Y'all gonna let them take this, too?

32:33.360 --> 32:35.480
You had your shot. You had several shots.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.480
Now you got a change of
heart? Get outta here.

32:38.560 --> 32:42.680
I can't stay no more in that place,
and I can't start over in another home.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.120
Excuse me, ma'am?

32:46.200 --> 32:48.720
I was just walking through your
store, hoping to buy some bubble wrap

32:48.800 --> 32:51.120
and maybe ship some chocolates
to my aunt in Carolina.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.840
And that's about all I'm gonna
sell you, is some bubble wrap,

32:53.920 --> 32:56.280
anything else, you've got the wrong shop.

32:56.360 --> 32:59.400
What you talking about? We all
good. I paid you $800 last month.

32:59.480 --> 33:01.640
For real? You gonna
make me go to the books?

33:01.720 --> 33:03.880
He paid you $800, right?

33:03.960 --> 33:08.440
What was the initial agreed-upon
price for the quantity in question?

33:10.440 --> 33:13.400
Well, look at you, using your big words.

33:13.480 --> 33:16.400
$1,250. Plus, he owes me $130 from before.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.520
$1,250 and $130. He in
the hole to you for $580,

33:20.600 --> 33:21.600
unless there's a vig.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.880
You can bet your ass there's a vig.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.440
So that would bring it up to $182,

33:26.520 --> 33:30.200
plus $50 penalty for partial
payment on the $1,250,

33:30.280 --> 33:33.320
now we talkin' $682.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.240
Fuckin' Goldberg over here.

33:35.320 --> 33:38.440
Come on, Vee, I got
customers waitin' on me.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.760
You're my wholesaler. Help a brother out.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.000
What you think?

33:44.920 --> 33:47.120
I think he seem pretty desperate.

33:47.200 --> 33:51.280
I say give him half now and the other
half when that debt drops to zero.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.480
This is fucked.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.040
Careful, now.

34:00.120 --> 34:02.360
He up to $1,307 now.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.960
You find me by week's end.

34:10.680 --> 34:14.640
Well, looks like adding up all
them little nickels and dimes

34:14.720 --> 34:19.360
at Burger McFat-Ass done taught you
a thing or two, huh, Taystee Girl?

34:23.480 --> 34:24.800
You ready to work?

34:29.520 --> 34:31.200
I'm gonna go check on inventory.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.280
- Hey.
- Oh, thank God. Come in.

35:09.360 --> 35:10.800
- Did you bring the beer?
- Coronas, right?

35:10.880 --> 35:13.360
No! No, no, no, dark beer.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.560
It's supposed to be dark
beer. It helps my milk come in.

35:15.640 --> 35:19.000
I'm not making fucking fish tacos,
Larry. I'm trying to feed my child.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.680
And you brought the dark beer, thank you.

35:22.760 --> 35:23.960
You're welcome.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.880
I'm sorry, I'm going bat-shit.

35:27.080 --> 35:32.240
Uh, Polly, your breast is kind of...

35:32.320 --> 35:34.880
Please, they're always out. I'm
the UPS guy's new favorite stop.

35:36.880 --> 35:41.240
Hey, have you talked to Piper at all?

35:42.240 --> 35:44.400
No, and you know that.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.280
And I know you broke up.

35:47.360 --> 35:51.600
And I know she freaked out and got
sent to live in a shoe or something,

35:51.680 --> 35:54.760
and now she's in Chicago.
She fucking hates deep-dish.

35:54.840 --> 35:55.840
I know!

35:57.120 --> 35:58.680
Well, I heard all this from her mom.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.240
Look, Larry, she's my friend, and
I'll always take her side over yours,

36:03.320 --> 36:07.480
and I'll always be friends with her,
and who knows how long I'll know you?

36:07.560 --> 36:12.640
But just between us, I think she's being
an idiot and self-destructive and stupid,

36:12.720 --> 36:15.000
and my sympathies are with
you all the way on this one.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.960
Well, thank you.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.600
For what? I never said a thing.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.440
I don't talk about Piper with you.
That would be disloyal and wrong.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.880
Gotcha.

36:27.960 --> 36:29.560
So, when is Pete back?

36:30.680 --> 36:34.360
I don't know, I may not let him come back.
The baby is less than three months old

36:34.440 --> 36:36.560
and suddenly he has to go on a
vision quest in the fucking tundra?

36:36.640 --> 36:38.440
Well, to be fair, he
said you told him to go.

36:38.520 --> 36:42.640
I'm a hormonal moron! I didn't mean
it. I didn't think he would actually go.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.720
I haven't showered in three days, Larry.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.400
My mother is in a fucking pinochle
tournament for the whole week,

36:47.480 --> 36:48.960
not that she's any help when she's here,

36:49.040 --> 36:52.280
and I don't have a goddamn baby nurse
because I'm trying attachment parenting,

36:52.360 --> 36:53.640
and it's fucking bullshit.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.560
Here, take this child before I
drown him in my tears and sweat.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.960
Hey, hey, hey, buddy, hello.

37:00.040 --> 37:05.240
Hello, baby, hi, it's your Uncle Larry.

37:05.320 --> 37:09.800
Hi, how's it going, buddy? We're
gonna hang out tonight, man, yeah.

37:10.880 --> 37:14.560
We're gonna order some Thai food, maybe
watch a little TV. How's that sound?

37:14.640 --> 37:15.600
Cool with that?

37:15.680 --> 37:17.560
I'm gonna take a shower.
Can you change him?

37:19.560 --> 37:22.560
Yeah, I mean, sure, I can try.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.760
Okay.

37:27.880 --> 37:28.840
Mmm!

37:28.920 --> 37:32.920
He's all new and just happy.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.600
Yep, don't worry, Pete and
I will fuck that right up.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.320
No, is that true?

37:39.400 --> 37:42.400
Come, now. That's not true.
You stay happy, buddy, okay?

37:42.480 --> 37:46.080
You just... you just stay happy, all right?

37:47.320 --> 37:49.360
You know, I got the idea
from when you was a baby.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.680
No one was allowed to ever give you yogurt,

37:51.760 --> 37:53.720
'cause you would, like, fucking explode.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.480
There'd be shit everywhere.

37:55.560 --> 37:58.720
Up your back, in your
hair. It was so disgusting.

37:58.800 --> 38:02.440
But now it's coming in handy, right?

38:03.520 --> 38:04.960
Right?

38:05.040 --> 38:06.000
Is it working?

38:06.080 --> 38:08.680
Could you just please
give me some privacy here?

38:08.760 --> 38:11.560
You're making me really,
really uncomfortable.

38:11.640 --> 38:12.840
I'm your mother.

38:12.920 --> 38:16.040
God, can I just shit in peace?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.560
Fine.

38:18.640 --> 38:22.600
But if you have any action,
you let me know, okay?

38:22.680 --> 38:26.680
- I fucking care.
- Fine, fine, just go.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.000
All right, here, stand up.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.200
This should fit you better
around the waist now.

38:43.400 --> 38:46.680
Yeah, thanks for lookin' out, P.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.920
It's what you do for family.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.480
Yeah, what, you my crazy Aunt Poussey now?

38:50.560 --> 38:52.680
No, I'm your sister from another mister

38:52.760 --> 38:56.200
about to beat your ass down if you don't
read that book till you know it cold.

38:56.280 --> 38:59.160
You got some interview ass-kickin' to do.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.400
Make me proud.

39:11.280 --> 39:14.440
Guess who's back and better than ever? Hey!

39:17.240 --> 39:21.160
I know you said to get AnyStamp,
but the hobby shop was mad fun, yo!

39:21.240 --> 39:22.480
You ever been in there?

39:22.560 --> 39:26.080
Made me wanna get all
crafty, get some puffy paint,

39:26.160 --> 39:28.320
or a rhinestone machine.

39:28.400 --> 39:32.040
They had a whole fucking
aisle of pipe cleaners!

39:32.120 --> 39:33.440
Pipe cleaners!

39:33.520 --> 39:38.360
Man, in group home, all we got was
broken crayons and dried up glue sticks.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.680
Are we marking scag-bags or
we decorating your journal?

39:40.760 --> 39:42.280
I don't know, though, Vee.

39:42.360 --> 39:45.320
I mean, maybe you wanna consider one
of these for your trademark, you know?

39:45.400 --> 39:47.480
Glue a pair of these on every bag,

39:47.560 --> 39:49.960
or call it googly smag, you know?

39:50.040 --> 39:51.000
Shit's all gangster!

39:51.080 --> 39:54.400
All right, maybe I got
a little carried away,

39:54.480 --> 39:57.440
but look how cute this one is.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.480
Can I have my change, please?

39:58.560 --> 40:00.880
I did not send you to the store with
a C-note to bring back googly eyes.

40:00.960 --> 40:01.960
Okay.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.000
But for serious,

40:04.080 --> 40:06.000
like, why couldn't you use
something different for a stamp?

40:06.080 --> 40:08.960
Like Mr. Owl here?

40:09.040 --> 40:10.080
People do this shit, right?

40:10.160 --> 40:13.160
Like, there's dope with all
sorts of crazy shit on it.

40:13.240 --> 40:14.840
It's not about what you put on the package,

40:14.920 --> 40:17.040
it's about the quality of your product.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.160
I don't know, though, she kind of right.

40:19.240 --> 40:21.320
You pick something weird,

40:21.400 --> 40:23.520
people gonna remember that shit for sure.

40:24.480 --> 40:25.840
That owl looks drunk.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.200
I like the horse and the bicycle.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.680
Okay, say we use the horse.

40:30.760 --> 40:34.400
Call our shit Horsey Horse, get it?

40:34.480 --> 40:37.440
Because heroin's called
horse. Yo, that's money!

40:37.520 --> 40:39.560
I'm telling you, people be like, "Ooh,

40:39.640 --> 40:42.920
"I need me some more of that Horsey
Horse. This shit was so good!"

40:43.000 --> 40:45.280
Before you know it,
you've got a call brand.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.920
Listen to her trying
to teach me how to deal.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.320
Y'all laughing now, but I'm telling you,

40:50.400 --> 40:52.440
come visit me one day
when I'm on Wall Street

40:52.520 --> 40:54.480
and having some white boy get me lunch,

40:54.560 --> 40:57.120
and I'm wheelin' a big old
deal, and he talking about,

40:57.200 --> 40:59.720
"Ms. Jefferson, you
have a call on line two."

40:59.800 --> 41:01.240
Think you've been watching too many movies.

41:01.320 --> 41:05.120
I'm just saying, yo, this
is not my forever career.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.160
Girl, you from this hood,

41:06.240 --> 41:08.080
you don't get a career, you get a job.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.200
This right here is the
best-paying job around.

41:10.280 --> 41:11.240
Preach it, Vee.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.040
- You know what people respect? Money.
- Hmm.

41:14.120 --> 41:16.920
You keep working for me, that's
exactly what you gonna have.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.920
Ain't that right, RJ? Don't
I take care of my people?

41:19.000 --> 41:20.200
- Yes, ma'am.
- Eh, whatever.

41:21.320 --> 41:24.320
Look here, taste this, girl. Tell
me if it needs some more salt.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.400
- Mmm! That is good.
- I know.

41:31.480 --> 41:33.800
- What's that, pumpkin?
- Butternut squash and ginger,

41:33.880 --> 41:35.120
- and I threw in some leeks, just 'cause.
- Mmm!

41:35.200 --> 41:38.560
All right, now, listen, RJ, clear
off that table, grab this salad.

41:38.640 --> 41:41.640
- Is anybody else coming home for dinner?
- Uh, think it's just us.

41:41.720 --> 41:44.920
All right, grab some bowls, please.

41:46.680 --> 41:49.160
Oh, yes, ooh, this smells good.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.240
Get the placemats. All right.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.520
"Horsey Horse".

41:55.600 --> 41:58.640
That's kind of fun. But, Lord, have
mercy, it's silly, just like you.

41:59.760 --> 42:02.080
I tried a new bread tonight, y'all.

42:02.160 --> 42:05.880
It's a whole grain flaxseed bread.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.480
Y'all need some more fiber in your diet.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.560
Grab a knife for this bread, too, Taste.

42:09.640 --> 42:12.040
Bring the bowls, girl.
What you waiting for?

42:25.040 --> 42:26.040
Hey, Red.

42:27.280 --> 42:31.760
These are great seats, you can
really see the stage from here.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.640
You really don't need to do this.

42:34.720 --> 42:38.160
I mean, I appreciate the
gesture and everything, but...

42:38.240 --> 42:42.840
But what? We'll be ostracized?
Already no one notices us.

42:42.920 --> 42:47.160
We're old and invisible,
so why not be old together?

42:47.240 --> 42:48.920
We keep each other company.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.760
You calling me old?

42:51.840 --> 42:53.360
I'm 23.

42:53.440 --> 42:57.160
How about matured? Like
a big, branchy tree.

42:57.240 --> 43:00.480
With snow-white roots.

43:00.560 --> 43:04.200
Oh, shit. I gotta deal with that, huh?

43:04.280 --> 43:07.040
Or just let it go. Fuck it.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.360
Who we trying to impress?

43:14.640 --> 43:16.360
She looks rough for 23.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.000
Where we going?

43:35.080 --> 43:36.280
We're going to town.

43:37.480 --> 43:38.600
Really?

43:38.680 --> 43:41.280
Medical center. She's
going to the oral surgeon.

43:41.360 --> 43:42.920
Hope you got lots of those magazines,

43:43.000 --> 43:46.600
'cause it's gonna be
hours and hours and hours.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.200
Oh, I got plenty.

43:48.280 --> 43:51.040
And I got my radio shows. I'll be fine.

43:52.280 --> 43:54.280
Good for you, Doggett.

43:54.360 --> 43:57.400
- Congratu-fucking-lations.
- Thank you.

43:58.680 --> 43:59.880
That's right,

43:59.960 --> 44:02.160
we at the Philip Morris Companies
believe in second chances.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.760
We welcome people who
can handle the challenges

44:04.840 --> 44:07.680
of manufacturing and marketing
products meant for adults

44:07.760 --> 44:10.960
in a highly regulated
and restricted environment

44:11.040 --> 44:16.040
while striving each day to
operate responsibly. Thank you.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.880
Man, I thought special
guests meant like Mo'Nique

44:21.960 --> 44:23.400
or Wesley Snipes or somethin.'

44:23.480 --> 44:25.920
Not some cigarette-hawkin'
fuck-nut reminding us

44:26.000 --> 44:27.360
that the only people
who want to hire felons

44:27.440 --> 44:29.160
are already hated by everybody else.

44:29.240 --> 44:30.760
Nah, see, they ain't so bad.

44:30.840 --> 44:33.560
See, people can decide for
theyselves if they wanna smoke.

44:33.640 --> 44:37.480
The real evil are them companies
killin' us without consent.

44:37.560 --> 44:43.280
Monsanto. Rio Tinto. Big
Pharma, BP, Halliburton.

44:43.360 --> 44:46.680
I been readin' there's
some dark shit goin' down.

44:46.760 --> 44:49.040
Not that any of 'em
motherfuckers ever wanna hire us.

44:49.120 --> 44:53.080
But the real criminals, they
don't bother with us small-timers.

44:54.840 --> 44:59.560
And now Mr. Slovin will "interview"
two "prospective employees".

44:59.640 --> 45:05.080
Many lessons to be learned here,
ladies. Please pay close attention.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.400
Hello, and thank you for coming in today.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.680
Well, hello to you, too.

45:18.760 --> 45:22.640
Hello, and thank you so much for
taking the time to see me today.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.600
The best boss I ever had?

45:25.680 --> 45:29.040
I would have to say Gloria
in the kitchen right here

45:29.120 --> 45:34.360
because she's really organized,
and she plays real good music.

45:34.440 --> 45:37.800
My greatest strength, I'd have
to say, is my positive attitude,

45:37.880 --> 45:41.440
and my aptitude for rote memorization.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.400
I see something once, and I got it down.

45:43.480 --> 45:47.160
I use my time very efficiently.
I'm almost never late.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.000
She was late today.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.880
For example, in my old
job, a long-term client

45:51.960 --> 45:53.800
was about to take his
business to a competitor.

45:53.880 --> 45:57.800
I was able to meet with the customer
and change the way we handled his account

45:57.880 --> 46:00.760
on a day-to-day basis in
order to keep the business.

46:00.840 --> 46:03.640
I think it's important to have close,

46:03.720 --> 46:07.280
intimate relationships
with your co-workers.

46:07.360 --> 46:09.960
It's good for morale, you know?

46:11.800 --> 46:13.840
Okay, that's, like, a foul.

46:13.920 --> 46:17.280
It was lovely meeting
both of you, thank you.

46:17.360 --> 46:21.160
Thank you, Mr. Slovin, and may I
say what a privilege it would be

46:21.240 --> 46:23.240
to work for the Philip Morris Corporation,

46:23.320 --> 46:26.480
a company that has remained the
largest cigarette manufacturer

46:26.560 --> 46:28.880
in the US since 1983,

46:28.960 --> 46:33.080
plus has increased its dividends
46 times in the last 44 years.

46:33.160 --> 46:35.920
You all tore this market
up in the face of a world

46:36.000 --> 46:38.240
that was trying to tear you down.

46:38.320 --> 46:40.200
Now, see, that's the company for me.

46:40.280 --> 46:43.160
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah, Taystee!

46:43.240 --> 46:45.000
Thank you, Miss Jefferson.

46:45.080 --> 46:48.480
Yeah, yes, let's hear a round
of applause for Miss Jefferson,

46:48.560 --> 46:50.080
and Miss Gonzales.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.760
Taystee! Taystee! Taystee!

47:14.400 --> 47:16.600
They gonna need that picture, boo.

47:17.720 --> 47:19.720
I'm afraid to see him lying there.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.560
I think once you see
him, you won't be scared.

47:24.520 --> 47:28.200
He's still our RJ. He's just
not in that body anymore.

47:29.240 --> 47:33.880
But it's like, once the funeral is
over, he's really gone, you know?

47:35.680 --> 47:36.760
Yeah.

47:39.120 --> 47:40.560
I raised that boy.

47:41.920 --> 47:47.240
Watched that smile go from
snaggletooth to lady-killer.

47:47.320 --> 47:51.160
I swear he could charm
the fish out of water.

47:51.240 --> 47:53.720
Man, how can they get away with this?

47:53.800 --> 47:55.480
Ain't nobody gonna do nothing?

47:57.720 --> 48:00.520
Cops claim he was armed.

48:00.600 --> 48:02.920
I don't know, maybe he was. I...

48:03.000 --> 48:06.560
I told him to not carry a piece.

48:06.640 --> 48:09.640
A black man walking around
this city at night...

48:12.040 --> 48:15.400
We had plans to go to the
Statue of Liberty together.

48:16.400 --> 48:19.040
Neither of us ever been.

48:20.000 --> 48:24.040
We had reservations to walk up
into the head and everything.

48:24.120 --> 48:26.560
So stupid.

48:30.360 --> 48:32.360
I'll take you.

48:32.440 --> 48:34.280
I got you now, Taystee Girl.

48:34.360 --> 48:36.280
You can't promise that.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.520
I protect my babies.

48:41.880 --> 48:43.520
This one got away,

48:45.360 --> 48:50.000
but I swear to you, I will die
before I see that happen again.

48:51.280 --> 48:53.880
I will keep you safe.

49:17.560 --> 49:19.040
Come on, come.

49:20.480 --> 49:22.320
Come on, I've got you.

49:28.320 --> 49:30.280
- Well?
- How'd it go in there?

49:30.360 --> 49:33.600
- Victory.
- Yeah! That's my girl!

49:33.680 --> 49:35.960
Good for you, you must feel so much better.

49:36.040 --> 49:38.600
- I just feel free.
- It was the yogurt, right? A mother knows.

49:38.680 --> 49:41.520
The drink that I gave you has
helped women in my family dookie

49:41.600 --> 49:42.840
for 14 generations.

49:42.920 --> 49:44.880
You know, I think it was a
combination of both things.

49:44.960 --> 49:48.360
Whatever it was, it don't
matter. I am so happy, you guys.

49:50.760 --> 49:52.680
Hey, what's going on here?

49:52.760 --> 49:54.720
- Daya finally shit!
- A big one.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.520
She feels so much better now.

49:56.600 --> 50:00.600
My God! I can't believe you guys!
I've never been so humiliated. Jesus!

50:03.560 --> 50:04.760
Well, go on.

50:04.840 --> 50:07.560
Go after her. Tell her it's gonna be okay.

50:08.880 --> 50:09.920
Okay.

50:14.600 --> 50:15.840
We embarrassed her.

50:15.920 --> 50:18.120
Whatever, happens, mothers
embarrass their kids.

50:19.480 --> 50:20.480
Yeah.

50:20.560 --> 50:23.960
Hey, where the fuck did you get the yogurt?

50:25.680 --> 50:28.160
So, Mr. Slovin, who gets the job?

50:30.360 --> 50:31.720
Miss Tasha Jefferson.

50:39.760 --> 50:42.760
That's right! In your face, Skinny Bean!

50:42.840 --> 50:45.200
Whatever, it don't even mean nothing.

50:45.280 --> 50:46.880
I don't even smoke.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.720
Taystee!

50:48.800 --> 50:51.680
Okay, and that concludes job fair.

50:51.760 --> 50:54.000
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

50:57.800 --> 51:00.960
Hey, so, how do I get a hold
of someone about that job?

51:01.040 --> 51:02.000
Excuse me?

51:02.080 --> 51:04.760
A job. I heard you get hooked up
with one if you win this thing.

51:04.840 --> 51:06.640
Winning is a victory in itself.

51:08.120 --> 51:11.320
But last year, Ocampo got set
up with some receptionist gig.

51:11.400 --> 51:13.680
That's simply untrue. This isn't a contest.

51:13.760 --> 51:16.200
You do your best because that's
what you're supposed to do.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.520
Why is it so hard for
you people to understand?

51:18.600 --> 51:22.200
You're like babies. "Where's my
present?" "Pay attention to me."

51:22.280 --> 51:24.560
"Give me things." "Fix
the heat." "Build a gym."

51:24.640 --> 51:27.920
I'm not your goddamn mommy. Grow up!

51:33.240 --> 51:37.720
In acknowledgment of your
hard work and success,

51:37.800 --> 51:41.680
an award of $10 will be added
to your commissary fund. Enjoy.

51:41.760 --> 51:43.120
Yeah, that's something.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.600
That is something.
Thank you, Miss Figueroa.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.160
Oh, shit.

51:58.840 --> 52:05.560
