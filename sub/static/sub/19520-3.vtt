<i>Previously on "Bates Motel"...</i>

00:01.891 --> 00:02.835
- Oh, hi.
- <i>Who is she?</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:04.523
Mother, she's married.

00:04.525 --> 00:07.179
You can't have other people in
your life, especially women.

00:08.195 --> 00:09.744
<i>I went to see Romero in prison.</i>

00:09.745 --> 00:12.154
I'm coming for you when
you least expect it.

00:12.155 --> 00:13.744
Mother, he is going to get out someday,

00:13.745 --> 00:15.784
and we have to deal with it.

00:15.785 --> 00:17.534
<i>I'm just visiting my sister.</i>

00:17.535 --> 00:20.273
<i>Your sister... she passed away.</i>

00:20.275 --> 00:23.507
Of all the gin joints
in all of the towns...

00:24.575 --> 00:25.694
Don't mess with me right now.

00:25.695 --> 00:27.364
<i>You just found out.</i>

00:27.365 --> 00:29.574
<i>I told her he was gonna snap someday.</i>

00:29.575 --> 00:31.244
<i>He's not getting away with it.</i>

00:31.245 --> 00:32.984
<i>Norman!</i>

00:32.985 --> 00:34.574
<i>I know what you did!</i>

00:37.405 --> 00:39.784
- Holy...
- Well, now you know, Chick.

00:39.785 --> 00:40.864
I'm still alive.

01:03.985 --> 01:06.574
Hello, Caleb.

01:06.575 --> 01:09.444
How you feeling?

01:09.445 --> 01:12.034
Who's that?

01:12.035 --> 01:14.364
It's Norma.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.534
Norma.

01:16.897 --> 01:19.646
I... I thought you had died.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.436
Somebody told me you had died.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.668
I'm sorry I had to hit you.

01:23.669 --> 01:26.838
You broke into the house. You scared me.

01:26.839 --> 01:29.748
I'm sorry you know my secret.

01:29.749 --> 01:30.998
Puts me in a tough spot.

01:35.249 --> 01:39.708
Why are you always putting
me in tough spots, Caleb?

01:42.249 --> 01:45.272
I'm sorry.

01:45.319 --> 01:49.608
Gee. All better. Everything's
right as rain now.

01:59.699 --> 02:03.448
Why did you come here, Caleb?

02:03.449 --> 02:06.778
I came here because...

02:06.779 --> 02:09.527
Dylan and Emma.

02:16.159 --> 02:17.448
What happened?

02:17.449 --> 02:19.448
They had a baby.

02:20.569 --> 02:22.408
A baby?

02:23.699 --> 02:25.948
Her name's Katherine.

02:27.029 --> 02:30.028
A granddaughter.

02:30.029 --> 02:32.658
I wish I could see her.

02:44.159 --> 02:47.568
Well, it was nice of you
to come and tell me,

02:47.569 --> 02:49.108
to try and help.

02:49.109 --> 02:51.368
So y-you can let me go now, Norma.

02:51.369 --> 02:54.408
I mean, I'll just leave. I
won't bother you again.

02:58.069 --> 03:00.908
I can't let you go.

03:00.909 --> 03:03.738
You know something you're
not supposed to know.

03:03.739 --> 03:05.108
You know I'm not dead.

03:08.109 --> 03:10.198
So we need to figure out
what to do with you.

03:11.869 --> 03:13.698
What do you mean, what to do with me?

03:51.819 --> 03:54.278
Oh.

03:54.279 --> 03:57.068
So how's he doing?

03:57.069 --> 03:59.408
He's placid.

03:59.409 --> 04:01.738
Confused. Upset. Scared.

04:01.739 --> 04:04.278
Understandable.

04:04.279 --> 04:06.278
You've been very kind to Norman, Chick,

04:06.279 --> 04:09.448
and I've appreciated that.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.908
You're looking in on him.
You're helping him.

04:11.909 --> 04:13.778
Bringing him animals and food.

04:13.779 --> 04:15.869
You've been a really good friend.

04:17.369 --> 04:19.528
But why?

04:21.279 --> 04:25.698
I enjoy helping people.

04:27.819 --> 04:30.568
Can you keep this secret about me?

04:33.489 --> 04:36.278
Can I trust you, Chick?

04:37.869 --> 04:39.778
Trust is the foundation and the bedrock

04:39.779 --> 04:42.068
of every relationship.

04:45.489 --> 04:49.659
You can trust me... Norma.

04:51.909 --> 04:54.318
I'm kind of glad you know, actually.

04:54.319 --> 04:55.738
Hmm.

04:57.319 --> 04:58.948
It's been a real pain in the ass

04:58.949 --> 05:01.408
having to hide every time you came over.

05:02.659 --> 05:04.608
I can only imagine.

05:06.489 --> 05:09.488
Yeah, just think, now you don't
have to do that anymore.

05:09.489 --> 05:11.318
I'm just gonna go to bed

05:11.319 --> 05:12.658
and figure out what to do tomorrow.

05:12.659 --> 05:15.068
Hey, Norma?

05:15.069 --> 05:18.488
Can I stay here for a little while?

05:18.489 --> 05:21.278
I want to look after you guys while...

05:21.279 --> 05:23.028
while he's still in the basement.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.488
I guess so.

05:28.909 --> 05:31.318
Are you scared of him?

05:33.699 --> 05:35.778
I try not to be.

05:37.319 --> 05:38.818
Yeah.

05:40.569 --> 05:42.948
Well, I'm here now.

05:42.949 --> 05:44.948
Thank you, Chick.

05:47.319 --> 05:49.658
Good night.

05:51.529 --> 05:53.408
Good night, Norma.

06:01.489 --> 06:03.988
So what's the drive? Five, six hours?

06:04.489 --> 06:05.786
Something like that.

06:06.529 --> 06:09.068
You got worked over.

06:09.622 --> 06:11.661
Aah, it's fine.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.332
Little, uh, going-away present
from some guys on my block.

06:15.872 --> 06:18.461
I saw you used to be a sheriff.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.098
You got popped on a
perjury charge, right?

06:21.100 --> 06:22.139
Yeah.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.792
Such bullshit.

06:25.872 --> 06:27.791
Thanks.

06:27.792 --> 06:29.001
It's Alex.

06:29.002 --> 06:30.461
Well, I guess you know that.

06:30.462 --> 06:31.581
- Doug.
- Hey.

06:31.582 --> 06:33.581
Chatty one there's Alicia.

06:33.582 --> 06:35.622
- Hi, Alicia.
- Hey.

06:42.872 --> 06:45.161
<i>Norman.</i>

06:45.162 --> 06:47.871
<i>Norman.</i>

06:47.872 --> 06:50.372
<i>Good morning, sweetheart.
How you feeling?</i>

06:51.622 --> 06:53.871
Oh, not so good.

06:53.872 --> 06:57.041
I... I blacked out, didn't I?

06:57.042 --> 07:00.081
Yeah. You're okay now.

07:00.082 --> 07:03.461
- Sorry we fought last night.
- Me too.

07:03.462 --> 07:05.371
I shouldn't have followed
you to that restaurant.

07:05.372 --> 07:08.421
It was stupid. You were right.

07:08.422 --> 07:11.331
I just feel like I go a bit crazy here

07:11.332 --> 07:13.421
on my own all the time.

07:13.422 --> 07:15.371
Yeah, I'm sure it's hard on you too.

07:15.372 --> 07:17.291
This has all been so much stress.

07:17.292 --> 07:18.832
Ever since the...

07:21.212 --> 07:25.621
Well, I don't even really
remember when it wasn't, Mother.

07:25.622 --> 07:27.661
You know what? Just stay in bed.

07:27.662 --> 07:29.501
You know, we don't have
to be anywhere today,

07:29.502 --> 07:31.621
so I'll bring up some
food in a little bit,

07:31.622 --> 07:33.752
and everything's gonna be fine.

07:39.002 --> 07:40.961
Oh, by the way, stay
out of the basement.

07:40.962 --> 07:43.501
Why shouldn't I go in the basement?

07:43.502 --> 07:45.621
Because I've been organizing down there

07:45.622 --> 07:47.581
and you're gonna start
pushing things around

07:47.582 --> 07:49.421
and then I'm gonna get annoyed.

07:49.422 --> 07:50.921
Just stay here. Stay in bed.

07:50.922 --> 07:52.581
Rest up. You need it.

07:52.582 --> 07:54.712
Okay, Mother.

08:02.872 --> 08:04.292
Hey.

08:07.122 --> 08:09.541
Brought you some food.

08:09.542 --> 08:13.371
- When did you come in?
- Just last night.

08:13.372 --> 08:15.621
Do you remember last night, Norman?

08:15.622 --> 08:19.331
I was, uh, just drinking
more than I should have,

08:19.332 --> 08:22.541
so, you know, things are a little foggy.

08:22.542 --> 08:27.621
I found you passed out,
so I put you to bed.

08:27.622 --> 08:29.961
Hey, I got a question for you.

08:29.962 --> 08:32.421
Do you often have times like that

08:32.422 --> 08:34.922
where you get unconscious?

08:36.042 --> 08:38.331
Sometimes, yeah.

08:38.332 --> 08:40.291
Right.

08:40.292 --> 08:44.160
I'm gonna hang out here.
Keep an eye on you.

08:44.162 --> 08:45.421
Just a little while.

08:45.422 --> 08:47.661
Okay?

08:47.662 --> 08:50.791
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry, but I, um,

08:50.792 --> 08:52.661
I don't think that you
can stay here, Chick.

08:52.662 --> 08:55.661
It just might not be a good idea.

08:55.662 --> 08:58.621
Norman, it's okay.

08:59.712 --> 09:02.581
I know about her.

09:02.582 --> 09:05.001
You... you know about who?

09:05.002 --> 09:07.751
About your mother.

09:07.752 --> 09:09.121
I spoke to her.

09:09.122 --> 09:11.001
It's fine.

09:12.712 --> 09:15.211
My God. This is all my fault.

09:15.212 --> 09:16.921
I should never have
let you in the house.

09:16.922 --> 09:19.791
Norman, it's okay.

09:19.792 --> 09:23.421
I'm not here to judge you.

09:23.422 --> 09:25.291
Not for any of it.

09:27.122 --> 09:28.791
Okay?

09:31.082 --> 09:33.291
Thank you, Chick.

09:33.292 --> 09:36.001
No thanks necessary.

09:36.002 --> 09:39.421
We're all in this sideshow together,

09:39.422 --> 09:42.251
and then we die.

09:42.252 --> 09:45.121
You better just rest up for today.

09:45.122 --> 09:47.331
Eat some food.

09:47.332 --> 09:50.421
I'll be back for the tray.

10:02.286 --> 10:03.995
<i>Knees are gone. Can't hit a three.</i>

10:03.996 --> 10:05.325
- <i>Worthless at the line.</i>
- <i>Hey, he's... he's not.</i>

10:05.326 --> 10:06.955
<i>He's a very respectable</i>

10:06.956 --> 10:08.955
<i>60-something percent at the line.</i>

10:08.956 --> 10:10.915
<i>He's not what he used to
be, but all I'm saying</i>

10:10.916 --> 10:12.785
- <i>is he's had a career...</i>
- <i>Yeah, he's had a career...</i>

10:12.786 --> 10:14.535
- <i>He's played a lot.</i>
- <i>Meaning he's old.</i>

10:14.536 --> 10:16.115
<i>Fine. I'm old, so maybe I'm sympathetic,</i>

10:16.116 --> 10:17.785
- <i>but I'm telling you...</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

10:17.786 --> 10:20.155
<i>If you guys would just give it a break.</i>

10:20.156 --> 10:21.995
<i>I'm gonna get some coffee.
You want anything?</i>

10:21.996 --> 10:23.246
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

10:27.162 --> 10:29.662
- <i>How about a bathroom break?</i>
- <i>Yeah, sure.</i>

10:37.362 --> 10:40.621
Uh, you gonna help me out, or
you want to hold it for me?

10:40.622 --> 10:41.702
Funny.

10:46.532 --> 10:47.532
Thanks.

11:28.492 --> 11:29.702
All right, ready?

11:33.992 --> 11:35.781
Back up. Back up.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.911
Give me the keys.

11:37.912 --> 11:39.491
I don't want to hurt you.

11:39.492 --> 11:41.491
Now.

11:46.862 --> 11:48.201
Take your jacket off.

11:48.202 --> 11:50.701
- Alex, don't be stupid.
- Do it now.

11:54.242 --> 11:55.701
All right.

11:55.702 --> 11:57.411
Chain yourself to that post over there.

11:57.412 --> 11:58.701
Give me the gun. We'll pretend
this didn't happen...

11:58.702 --> 12:01.531
Do it.

12:18.662 --> 12:20.661
<i>Hey!</i>

12:20.662 --> 12:23.121
<i>Somebody!</i>

12:23.122 --> 12:25.491
<i>Help!</i>

12:25.492 --> 12:27.361
<i>Help me!</i>

12:28.862 --> 12:31.161
<i>Someone!</i>

12:32.162 --> 12:33.531
<i>Hey!</i>

12:48.532 --> 12:50.991
Hey, buddy. Can I get a ride?

12:50.992 --> 12:52.361
Sorry, dude. Can't help you.

12:53.742 --> 12:55.071
Uh, I think you can.

12:56.452 --> 12:58.071
Get in.

13:04.282 --> 13:05.571
Let's go. Come on.

13:08.702 --> 13:10.861
Okay, then turn right
when you get to the road,

13:10.862 --> 13:13.621
and I'll tell you where
to go after that.

13:18.202 --> 13:20.161
What's your name?

13:20.162 --> 13:21.861
Jason.

13:21.862 --> 13:24.281
Hey, Jason, everything's gonna be fine.

13:39.992 --> 13:42.531
<i>Clean up this damn house!</i>

13:44.242 --> 13:45.781
<i>Don't you run from me, you crazy bitch!</i>

13:45.782 --> 13:49.281
<i>You get back here and
take your medicine!</i>

13:51.452 --> 13:54.161
<i>You're like an animal I have
to beat some sense into!</i>

13:59.912 --> 14:05.121
<i>We're both in for almost
30 goddamn years!</i>

14:05.122 --> 14:09.412
<i>Some asshole, they took money.
Can't find anything!</i>

14:11.322 --> 14:13.821
I love you, Caleb.

14:13.822 --> 14:17.661
I love you too, Norma Louise.

14:17.662 --> 14:19.741
As long as we're together,

14:19.742 --> 14:23.571
nothing bad will ever happen to us.

14:33.532 --> 14:36.361
Where'd you come from? Where am I?

14:36.362 --> 14:38.822
You're still in Norma's basement.

14:41.452 --> 14:43.741
Hey. Cut me loose.

14:43.742 --> 14:46.321
You and I got no beef.
You said so yourself.

14:46.322 --> 14:49.572
Mm. That's not my role here.

14:50.742 --> 14:52.321
What do you mean?

14:52.322 --> 14:54.701
I don't feel that I have the authority

14:54.702 --> 14:55.911
to act in that manner.

14:55.912 --> 14:57.991
This is between you and Norma,

14:57.992 --> 15:01.821
and what happens to you
now, it's up to Norma,

15:01.822 --> 15:03.201
and I'm just an observer.

15:03.202 --> 15:05.531
<i>Norman.</i> Norman's insane.

15:05.532 --> 15:07.362
Did you notice?

15:09.572 --> 15:13.162
And Norma... Norma... Norma's...

15:14.322 --> 15:16.571
Look, he killed her.

15:16.572 --> 15:20.241
He froze her. Who does that?

15:20.242 --> 15:22.571
Look, I understand that
you're very concerned

15:22.572 --> 15:24.241
about what's gonna happen to you.

15:24.242 --> 15:25.122
I would be too.

15:27.202 --> 15:30.451
I'll be down in a little while
to let you take a leak.

15:59.770 --> 16:00.890
Come here.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.850
Over there.

16:07.754 --> 16:10.849
Okay. Keys and your cell phone.
Let's go.

16:10.850 --> 16:14.058
I won't tell anyone I saw you.

16:14.161 --> 16:17.280
I won't give them a description
or anything, I swear.

16:17.281 --> 16:19.490
I have a family.

16:19.491 --> 16:22.200
A wife. Two kids. A mother.

16:23.531 --> 16:26.160
Please, I... I don't want to die.

16:26.161 --> 16:27.620
Jason, I'm not... I'm
not gonna kill you.

16:27.621 --> 16:29.280
Nothing's gonna happen.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.080
All right? I just... I
need to put some distance

16:31.081 --> 16:33.910
between you and me before
the police find you.

16:33.911 --> 16:35.820
So just walk down this road,

16:35.821 --> 16:37.580
and you'll hit the highway
probably in a couple of hours,

16:37.581 --> 16:40.120
and you can flag somebody down
when you get there, okay?

16:44.081 --> 16:47.160
Just walk that way.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.281
What do you want?

17:22.871 --> 17:26.080
I just want to talk, actually.

17:27.491 --> 17:29.451
Talk? About what?

17:33.951 --> 17:40.080
I unexpectedly found myself...

17:40.081 --> 17:43.660
caught up in your family's drama.

17:43.661 --> 17:46.121
Is that the word?

17:48.741 --> 17:51.240
And I don't know anything about you.

17:51.241 --> 17:52.991
It's unsettling.

17:56.661 --> 18:00.280
Norma. I liked her very much, Caleb.

18:00.281 --> 18:02.321
I didn't even know her.

18:04.371 --> 18:06.320
I was hoping that you could
help me out with that.

18:06.321 --> 18:08.030
Can you give me some details?

18:08.031 --> 18:09.161
Why?

18:10.321 --> 18:12.661
'Cause I lost her too.

18:13.781 --> 18:16.740
Sure. Like what?

18:16.741 --> 18:20.531
What was it like when
you two were children?

18:27.491 --> 18:30.910
She was...

18:30.911 --> 18:33.530
she was everything to me.

18:33.531 --> 18:36.280
Our mom was crazy.

18:36.281 --> 18:40.240
You know, she would get depressed,

18:40.241 --> 18:45.910
lock us in a room for a day, two.

18:45.911 --> 18:50.161
And no food. No bathroom.

18:51.821 --> 18:53.740
And the only thing that
got me through all that

18:53.741 --> 18:58.531
was being with Norma.

18:59.911 --> 19:02.620
When did you two split up?

19:02.621 --> 19:04.700
She left when she was 17.

19:04.701 --> 19:10.951
She took off with some
guy from high school.

19:12.201 --> 19:14.451
Because you were raping her.

19:17.531 --> 19:21.030
No, I... I don't want
to talk about that.

19:22.531 --> 19:25.200
Did you keep in contact after that?

19:25.201 --> 19:26.990
Not much.

19:26.991 --> 19:31.200
She let me know when Dylan was born.

19:31.201 --> 19:33.490
Norman.

19:36.951 --> 19:40.450
I mean, I could think of her,

19:40.451 --> 19:43.780
laughing or dancing...

19:43.781 --> 19:46.080
playing the piano.

19:48.121 --> 19:51.820
She's... She's got this look she's had

19:51.821 --> 19:53.410
since she was, like, a little kid,

19:53.411 --> 19:56.820
where she would look at somebody so hard

19:56.821 --> 19:59.950
that you would think that they
were gonna burst into flames.

20:01.951 --> 20:05.580
I mean, God help you if she
looked at you like that.

20:07.161 --> 20:11.200
So it was okay, because I knew...

20:15.281 --> 20:17.660
She was somewhere.

20:24.621 --> 20:27.450
She was somewhere.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.240
Oh...

20:50.871 --> 20:52.321
Shit.

21:44.201 --> 21:47.030
What are you doing? What
happened to my picture?

21:47.031 --> 21:50.660
I... just tidying up.

21:50.661 --> 21:52.320
I accident... I bumped into it.

21:52.321 --> 21:54.740
I can... look, I can replace it.

21:54.741 --> 21:56.370
Well, no wonder.

21:56.371 --> 21:57.740
Try wearing a little
less clothing next time.

21:57.741 --> 21:59.490
Lose the kimono...

21:59.491 --> 22:01.120
<i>maybe you won't pull down the walls.</i>

22:01.121 --> 22:02.781
Okay, don't be rude, Mother.

22:05.661 --> 22:07.741
I'm sorry, Chick. I like your kimono.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.780
No, no, it's okay.

22:11.781 --> 22:13.490
It's not the first time
I've been given shit

22:13.491 --> 22:15.740
about the kimono.

22:15.741 --> 22:19.660
Well, look, uh, since we're all here,

22:19.661 --> 22:21.580
why don't we... I made us some food.

22:21.581 --> 22:26.240
We can all sit down and have
a nice dinner and talk.

22:26.241 --> 22:28.780
What do you... what... what do you say?

22:28.781 --> 22:31.450
This is good, Chick.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.450
Mm.

22:32.451 --> 22:34.740
No, it is.

22:34.741 --> 22:36.741
Where'd you learn to cook?

22:38.081 --> 22:41.321
Oh, you know... Taiwan.

22:42.781 --> 22:44.321
Here and there.

22:46.451 --> 22:48.660
Would you like some more
naan bread, Norman?

22:48.661 --> 22:50.161
Yes, please.

22:52.451 --> 22:54.621
Mm. If I may...

22:56.241 --> 23:03.200
I could be service to both of...
both of you.

23:03.201 --> 23:07.200
Um, I could fix the, uh, window
out front, for instance.

23:07.201 --> 23:11.321
I could watch over
things during blackouts.

23:12.951 --> 23:15.490
It's easier with two.

23:15.491 --> 23:18.780
I can't pay you anything.
We have no extra money.

23:18.781 --> 23:20.580
She's right. I mean,
there'd be no salary,

23:20.581 --> 23:23.160
so what would you be getting out of it?

23:23.161 --> 23:26.950
What would I... a place to be.

23:26.951 --> 23:29.080
You know, the knowledge
that I'm among friends.

23:29.081 --> 23:32.161
You know, I've lived
alone for a long time.

23:34.491 --> 23:36.321
I can be very useful, Norma.

23:37.951 --> 23:40.121
And discreet.

23:42.991 --> 23:44.910
I <i>would</i> like that window fixed.

23:44.911 --> 23:46.281
Hm.

23:50.911 --> 23:52.321
Did you not hear her?

23:54.951 --> 23:58.910
Oh, sorry. I'm a little
deaf in this ear since...

23:58.911 --> 24:00.740
since the beatings.

24:00.741 --> 24:03.411
Could you, um, could you repeat that?

24:05.661 --> 24:09.080
Oh, she'd love it if you
could fix the window.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.910
Well, yeah. Yeah, right away.

24:15.778 --> 24:19.148
Would you like some more curry, Norma?

24:28.328 --> 24:31.406
Hi! Hi.

24:31.594 --> 24:33.867
Yeah? Can... can I help you?

24:33.869 --> 24:35.868
I just came by to see Norman.

24:36.174 --> 24:39.656
My name's Madeleine Loomis. Is he in?

24:39.688 --> 24:42.022
I can go check, if you want.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.883
Oh, hey.

24:43.884 --> 24:45.093
Oh, I was just gonna come and find you.

24:45.094 --> 24:46.763
Hi.

24:46.764 --> 24:48.803
Miss Madeleine Loomis
is here to see you.

24:48.804 --> 24:50.553
Yes, I can see that.

24:50.554 --> 24:51.601
You don't need to announce her, Chick.

24:51.634 --> 24:53.463
You're not the butler.

24:53.464 --> 24:55.213
It's good to see you.

24:55.214 --> 24:57.053
I, uh, I actually just saw
you coming up the stairs.

24:58.594 --> 25:01.843
Oh, this is Chick.

25:01.844 --> 25:03.423
He's just helping us...
helping me, you know,

25:03.424 --> 25:07.423
a few odd jobs, fixing the window.

25:07.424 --> 25:09.263
I'm sorry if this is a bad time.

25:09.264 --> 25:11.093
I just came by and brought some cookies.

25:11.094 --> 25:12.843
- No, not at all.
- I want a cookie.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.593
What kind of cookies?

25:14.594 --> 25:16.883
Chocolate chip.

25:16.884 --> 25:19.303
It's actually very kind of you.

25:19.304 --> 25:22.503
So, um, why... why don't we just
head on down to the office?

25:22.504 --> 25:23.764
- Sure.
- And, uh... yeah.

25:27.054 --> 25:29.923
Thank you for the cookies.
They're delicious.

25:29.924 --> 25:31.673
I felt like I had to do something

25:31.674 --> 25:34.843
after making you go
to that awful dinner.

25:34.844 --> 25:38.053
I don't know what I was thinking.

25:38.054 --> 25:39.883
I... that's why I came over, really.

25:39.884 --> 25:41.174
To apologize.

25:42.804 --> 25:46.673
Well, no, you were just
trying to be helpful.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.503
I don't know if I was.

25:51.504 --> 25:55.673
I think I've just been so lonely,

25:55.674 --> 25:58.383
and I think, if I was
really honest with you,

25:58.384 --> 26:00.803
I just wanted to have dinner.

26:03.554 --> 26:07.053
Hey, it's okay.

26:07.054 --> 26:09.303
Is it? I'm not sure it is.

26:09.304 --> 26:11.923
It's just...

26:11.924 --> 26:14.673
it's been a lot of stress.

26:14.674 --> 26:17.053
Sam's gone all the time.

26:17.054 --> 26:21.263
He left this morning for
Seattle to close some deal.

26:21.264 --> 26:23.093
I don't even mind when
he leaves anymore.

26:23.094 --> 26:24.503
It's...

26:24.504 --> 26:26.593
gotten really bad at home.

26:26.594 --> 26:30.883
It's like I'm... like I'm
living with a stranger.

26:33.714 --> 26:35.423
I don't know what's going on with him.

26:39.674 --> 26:41.343
Um...

26:41.344 --> 26:44.423
maybe you need to ask him.

26:44.424 --> 26:48.133
Maybe we've just grown apart.

26:50.131 --> 26:52.960
I'm sorry. I don't know
why I'm telling you this.

26:52.961 --> 26:56.370
Because you know it's safe to tell me.

26:56.371 --> 26:59.830
Yeah. You're right.

27:03.291 --> 27:05.790
Then, um,

27:05.791 --> 27:09.170
do you think maybe we could be friends?

27:09.171 --> 27:10.630
Of course.

27:10.631 --> 27:14.250
Like, we could hang out sometimes?

27:14.251 --> 27:16.630
I mean, even though I'm married?

27:20.291 --> 27:22.500
Hey, maybe we should, uh,

27:22.501 --> 27:24.330
go take a walk in the
woods or something.

27:24.331 --> 27:25.920
It's starting to feel like fall.

27:25.921 --> 27:28.000
- Now?
- Yeah.

27:28.001 --> 27:29.290
Okay.

27:29.291 --> 27:30.581
Okay.

27:33.671 --> 27:35.331
What?

27:37.371 --> 27:41.000
Nothing. Sometimes you
just remind me of someone.

27:41.001 --> 27:44.460
Someone who I loved very much.

27:44.461 --> 27:46.580
Who?

27:46.581 --> 27:48.921
My mother.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.631
Is that a good thing?

27:55.131 --> 27:57.000
It's a very good thing.

27:57.001 --> 27:59.420
Okay, good.

28:34.751 --> 28:35.960
Caleb.

28:38.131 --> 28:41.290
Norma?

28:46.501 --> 28:50.080
Shh, shh, shh. It's all right.

28:50.081 --> 28:54.670
- I thought I lost you.
- No, you didn't.

28:54.671 --> 28:57.830
You can't. You can always find me.

28:57.831 --> 29:00.130
Just look.

29:03.211 --> 29:07.750
Norma? Norma?

29:17.831 --> 29:19.830
Where's the girl?

29:19.831 --> 29:21.080
Oh, she left,

29:21.081 --> 29:23.170
but I brought you back some cookies.

29:23.171 --> 29:26.210
Aah!

29:26.211 --> 29:29.370
- What's that noise?
- We have a bit of a situation.

29:29.371 --> 29:31.500
Norman!

29:31.501 --> 29:33.290
Get down here!

29:33.291 --> 29:34.540
Your uncle is in the basement.

29:34.541 --> 29:36.290
<i>Norman!</i>

29:36.291 --> 29:38.460
He's a little freaked out.

29:38.461 --> 29:40.500
Caleb?

29:40.501 --> 29:41.870
<i>Norman, I want to talk to you!</i>

29:41.871 --> 29:44.790
Caleb is in the basement? Why?

29:44.791 --> 29:46.750
He came here two nights ago.

29:46.751 --> 29:48.290
He thinks that Norma's dead,

29:48.291 --> 29:50.710
and he thinks that you killed her.

29:50.711 --> 29:52.750
And... and why would
he think that, Chick?

29:52.751 --> 29:54.960
I think that he's here to kill you.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.830
<i>Get down here!</i>

29:58.961 --> 30:01.250
He knows about Norma.

30:01.251 --> 30:02.790
He knows she's alive?

30:02.791 --> 30:05.630
He spoke to her. Yes, Norman.

30:08.001 --> 30:09.960
Why wouldn't my mother tell
me any of this, Chick?

30:09.961 --> 30:10.960
This is crazy.

30:10.961 --> 30:12.370
- Well...
- Mother?

30:12.371 --> 30:13.710
You had another blackout, Norman.

30:13.711 --> 30:15.130
- Mother!
- She wanted to wait until...

30:15.131 --> 30:17.080
Mother! Where is she now?

30:17.081 --> 30:18.670
- I haven't seen her.
- Mother!

30:18.671 --> 30:20.170
I have not seen her, Norman.

30:20.171 --> 30:22.000
What do you mean you
haven't seen her, Chick?

30:22.001 --> 30:23.960
I mean, she has to be here.
She has nowhere else to go.

30:23.961 --> 30:25.080
Do you want me to go down there

30:25.081 --> 30:27.040
and do something?

30:27.041 --> 30:28.290
No, it's not your problem, okay?

30:28.291 --> 30:29.670
I'll deal with it.

30:29.671 --> 30:31.210
Just... just go upstairs, okay?

30:31.211 --> 30:33.370
Go find Mother. Maybe
she's asleep in her bed.

30:33.371 --> 30:35.080
I just don't want her
to have left the house

30:35.081 --> 30:37.040
or something crazy.

30:37.041 --> 30:38.080
Okay.

30:38.081 --> 30:39.750
<i>Get down here!</i>

30:42.751 --> 30:46.170
<i>Norman!</i>

31:27.830 --> 31:29.790
Is that you, Norman?

31:31.205 --> 31:33.285
It's me again, Caleb. It's Norma.

31:34.375 --> 31:36.045
Norma.

31:37.785 --> 31:40.454
I don't like being locked up down here.

31:40.455 --> 31:42.494
Okay? Come undo these chains.

31:42.495 --> 31:44.954
I can't.

31:44.955 --> 31:48.204
It's not up to me. It's up to Norman.

31:48.205 --> 31:50.204
You know what I think?

31:50.205 --> 31:53.204
I think Norman doesn't even know.

31:53.205 --> 31:56.084
Know what?

31:56.085 --> 31:58.374
That you're keeping me
prisoner down here.

32:00.745 --> 32:02.204
I just haven't told him yet.

32:02.205 --> 32:04.544
It's gonna be a lot for him to absorb.

32:04.545 --> 32:06.494
He's not well, you know.

32:06.495 --> 32:09.664
How, Norma? How is he not well?

32:09.665 --> 32:11.494
He blacks out.

32:13.705 --> 32:14.784
He forgets who and where he is.

32:14.785 --> 32:16.784
He gets in trouble sometimes.

32:18.125 --> 32:20.454
Norman needs help.

32:21.785 --> 32:25.164
If you unchain me, I promise you,

32:25.165 --> 32:27.664
I'll help you take care of Norman.

32:27.665 --> 32:30.584
It would never work, Caleb.

32:30.585 --> 32:32.954
Why not?

32:32.955 --> 32:35.284
Because you're both in love with me.

32:35.285 --> 32:37.454
He's your son.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.284
And you're my brother.

32:40.285 --> 32:42.084
Yeah.

32:45.285 --> 32:47.124
Yeah.

32:55.455 --> 32:57.084
I don't want to hurt you.

32:59.915 --> 33:02.334
Even though you hurt me.

33:02.335 --> 33:06.704
You hurt me in the worst
possible way you could.

33:12.125 --> 33:13.664
I'm sorry, Norma.

33:15.495 --> 33:18.334
Let's not talk about it.
It can't be fixed.

33:18.335 --> 33:19.994
Okay.

33:23.455 --> 33:24.874
Let's just be together.

33:27.915 --> 33:30.784
Okay, Norma.

33:30.785 --> 33:32.704
Like when we were little.

33:34.165 --> 33:36.914
That pure place.

33:44.955 --> 33:46.414
I'm sorry.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.244
Norman will probably have to kill you.

33:48.245 --> 33:49.414
I can't do it.

33:54.335 --> 33:55.914
It doesn't really matter.

33:59.835 --> 34:02.204
I love you, Norma Louise.

34:03.915 --> 34:05.704
I know.

35:00.045 --> 35:02.284
- What are you doing?
- Whoa. Oh, hey.

35:02.285 --> 35:03.165
Easy, easy, easy.

35:05.835 --> 35:07.995
Point that somewhere else, okay?

35:09.415 --> 35:11.084
You trying to steal our car?

35:11.085 --> 35:14.665
No. No, no, no. I was
hiking, and I got lost.

35:17.285 --> 35:20.244
I'm just gonna step
out of the car, okay?

35:20.245 --> 35:23.165
Point... point that away, will you?

35:25.785 --> 35:29.744
Hey, I'm just gonna... I'm
gonna close the door.

35:29.745 --> 35:30.995
Okay?

35:32.915 --> 35:35.454
I'm sorry. I... I took
a really bad fall,

35:35.455 --> 35:36.994
and I'm cold, so I just got in there

35:36.995 --> 35:39.284
just to warm up.

35:39.285 --> 35:41.164
Okay? I'm Bill. What's your name?

35:41.165 --> 35:43.704
You don't look like a hiker.

35:45.375 --> 35:49.204
Yeah, I know. Didn't
exactly dress right.

35:49.205 --> 35:51.164
- It was pretty stupid.
- I'm gonna get my mom.

35:51.165 --> 35:52.584
No, no, no, you don't need to do that.

35:52.585 --> 35:53.494
I'll just go...

35:53.495 --> 35:54.744
Aah!

35:55.995 --> 35:58.044
Oh, shit.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.171
Found Norman in the basement,

36:06.172 --> 36:08.751
passed out, holding hands with his uncle

36:08.752 --> 36:12.131
while he thought he was Norma.

36:12.132 --> 36:15.791
I carried him upstairs
and put him in bed.

36:15.792 --> 36:17.212
Move.

36:19.672 --> 36:22.382
Feels like things are coming
to a significant head.

36:29.922 --> 36:32.341
The action's good.

36:32.342 --> 36:33.881
The ribbon is dry.

36:33.882 --> 36:35.671
Do you know where I could
get this thing inked?

36:35.672 --> 36:37.632
Uh, I... I don't know.

36:38.842 --> 36:40.252
Hmm. Don't know.

36:42.382 --> 36:47.001
Yeah. I'm a writer.

36:47.002 --> 36:49.501
You want something to write
with, I got laptops.

36:49.502 --> 36:51.421
Desktops are...

36:51.422 --> 36:55.291
Yeah, those aren't for me.

36:55.292 --> 36:59.671
Most people like to think that
old technology is useless.

36:59.672 --> 37:01.131
That's not true.

37:01.132 --> 37:03.961
It's just become unfashionable.

37:08.292 --> 37:10.591
Well, if it worked for Hemingway,

37:10.592 --> 37:12.131
Chandler, and Hammett,

37:12.132 --> 37:14.131
it's gonna have to work for me.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.421
What are you writing?

37:15.422 --> 37:17.921
A novel.

37:17.922 --> 37:18.921
What kind?

37:20.672 --> 37:22.091
True crime.

37:42.172 --> 37:44.052
Hi, sweetie.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.712
What happened?

37:51.962 --> 37:53.461
Chick put you in my bed.

37:53.462 --> 37:55.552
He found you passed out in the basement.

38:00.922 --> 38:03.502
Someone's in the basement, isn't there?

38:05.632 --> 38:07.792
It's your brother.

38:11.132 --> 38:12.551
Why... why did you keep this from me?

38:12.552 --> 38:14.341
Because I didn't know what to do.

38:14.342 --> 38:16.091
You just had a blackout.

38:16.092 --> 38:17.921
I didn't want to catapult
you into another one.

38:17.922 --> 38:19.791
I thought I could
handle it, but I can't.

38:19.792 --> 38:21.381
Handle what?

38:21.382 --> 38:22.961
Why is he chained up in
our basement, Mother?

38:22.962 --> 38:25.422
I need you to do something for me.

38:28.632 --> 38:30.211
I need you to kill him.

38:30.212 --> 38:32.051
I can't do it.

38:32.052 --> 38:35.211
You got to go down there;
you got to be strong,

38:35.212 --> 38:37.171
not black out, and you
have to do it now.

38:37.172 --> 38:38.711
I just sent Chick out for groceries.

38:38.712 --> 38:40.131
Mother...

38:40.132 --> 38:41.671
I forgot to tell him to get milk,

38:41.672 --> 38:43.131
but I texted him, so I hope he gets it.

38:43.132 --> 38:44.671
- Mother, I can't.
- Norman.

38:44.672 --> 38:46.341
Mother, maybe there's another way, okay.

38:46.342 --> 38:48.671
Maybe we don't have to live like this.

38:48.672 --> 38:50.551
I just... I felt better today.

38:50.552 --> 38:51.791
I... I felt happy.

38:51.792 --> 38:53.551
I went for a walk in the woods,

38:53.552 --> 38:55.381
and I felt better than I'd
felt in so long, ever since...

38:55.382 --> 38:58.001
Since you have to do this.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.961
I'm sorry, but I have done
it for you more than once.

39:02.632 --> 39:05.051
It is not safe for him to be alive.

39:05.052 --> 39:08.501
He is dangerous, and
he knows too much now,

39:08.502 --> 39:10.421
so you're gonna have to do it.

39:15.502 --> 39:17.751
You're gonna be happy again, Norman.

39:17.752 --> 39:19.591
I promise you that.

39:19.592 --> 39:22.921
The woods will always
be out there, okay?

39:22.922 --> 39:24.171
But you've got to do this.

39:24.172 --> 39:27.171
Now. For me, okay?

39:28.882 --> 39:30.841
Okay, Mother.

39:30.842 --> 39:33.501
Fast. Aim true. Right
through the brain, okay?

39:35.502 --> 39:37.341
Okay.

39:37.342 --> 39:39.342
That's my boy.

39:59.252 --> 40:04.342
Fast. Aim true. Right
through the brain, okay?

40:13.172 --> 40:15.381
Go ahead.

40:52.552 --> 40:56.251
I want you to leave, okay?

40:56.252 --> 41:00.381
I want you to leave and never come back.

41:01.712 --> 41:03.631
Because I just want to be left alone.

41:05.502 --> 41:07.791
Nothing is making sense.
I don't know what to do.

41:07.792 --> 41:09.421
I don't know where to go.

41:09.422 --> 41:10.791
I don't want to do this! Okay?

41:10.792 --> 41:12.961
I don't want to live like this anymore!

41:12.962 --> 41:15.881
Go! Go!

41:15.882 --> 41:18.461
Go!

41:18.462 --> 41:20.381
Go! Get out of here!

41:20.382 --> 41:21.381
Go!

41:30.882 --> 41:32.921
What are you doing? He will ruin us!

41:32.922 --> 41:34.251
Mother!

41:34.252 --> 41:35.291
Get back here!

41:38.592 --> 41:40.631
Mother!

41:40.632 --> 41:43.501
