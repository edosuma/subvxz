- What?

01:26.961 --> 01:29.270
I had to kiss her because... [STAMMERS]

Wait, wait, wait.

You tell her the rules, Jim.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.734
Well, you kiss people
and you get points,

01:49.818 --> 01:53.071
and the amount of points you get are...

01:53.154 --> 01:56.825
are determined by the rules,
and the rules are very strict.

[STAMMERING] The kissing game...

02:29.691 --> 02:34.279
because Miranda caught Uncle Jim
trying to kiss me,

02:34.362 --> 02:37.282
which made perfect sense 'cause we were
playing the kissing game, you know?

- This looks great, Dad.
- Yeah.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.875
Wait, wait, wait.
You said "kissing game..."

11:09.126 --> 11:10.336
Are you talking about Bethany?

11:11.629 --> 11:12.463
Yes.

11:12.546 --> 11:16.801
- Have you been kissing my wife?
- Uh... Uh... Yeah.

11:16.884 --> 11:18.469
You know what? That's fine.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.471
A lesser man would feel threatened,

11:20.554 --> 11:23.349
but I've got lots of cool stuff
going on in my life.

11:23.432 --> 11:26.727
I've got a walk-in closet,
I've got a glass stove...

11:26.811 --> 11:31.399
Well, Kelly, if you have a glass stove,
you don't need a woman's embrace.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.234
I'm feeling great about this.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.235
Actually, I'd assumed

11:34.318 --> 11:37.113
that you guys had gotten that
out of your system years ago.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.783
Probably took her so long
'cause she's still in love with me.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.243
Yeah, that's it.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.329
But, I don't know how to tell Miranda
about our relationship.

11:45.413 --> 11:49.166
[CHUCKLING] You don't tell her anything,
'cause she's gonna freak.

11:49.250 --> 11:53.212
Thanks, Jim. I always feel so much
better when I compare myself to you.

11:53.295 --> 11:57.133
[CHUCKLES] That was the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.344
Whoa! Stop! Stop! Do not go up on that.
You're gonna ruin it.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.514
If you wanna ride it, you can watch me,
and pretend it's you, okay? So...

12:05.474 --> 12:06.809
Just watch this.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.061
Okay, just close your eyes,

12:09.145 --> 12:10.896
pretend it's you going down
on the roller coaster.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.523
Ready for this? It's gonna be so fun.

12:12.606 --> 12:13.649
[GRUNTS]

12:15.901 --> 12:17.111
[EXCLAIMS]

12:18.279 --> 12:19.864
See? So fun.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.825
Okay, we've seen it, we can go now.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.034
[AMANDA CHUCKLES] Okay, sure.

12:24.827 --> 12:29.999
[PANTS] Patrick. Hi! I didn't know
you'd be here. What a surprise!

12:30.082 --> 12:32.460
You texted me 37 times.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.086
Hmm?

12:34.170 --> 12:37.047
We're super excited about Miranda World.
It looks really great.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.885
It looks really great, doesn't it?
So great.

12:40.968 --> 12:43.804
You brought her. That's so neat.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.265
Okay, well, nice seeing you.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.310
Oh, no. Wait! No, stop!

12:49.393 --> 12:51.270
[STAMMERING] I need help.

12:51.353 --> 12:54.940
Oh! Uh, sure. With what?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.443
Um... Uh...

12:59.528 --> 13:00.905
Oh...

13:01.989 --> 13:02.907
My butt.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.327
I need you to stuff my butt.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.538
Can't you tell it needs some stuffing?

13:09.622 --> 13:12.416
It's a little flat in the back,
needs some more cushion for the pushin'.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.668
- Uh... Um...
- Miranda...

13:14.752 --> 13:19.256
Stuff my butt.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.135
Oh, and, Patrick,
I have a different job for you.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.889
Let's see. What is the furthest away?

13:26.972 --> 13:31.101
Oh, yes, the Daddy Saddle Ride.
You can run that.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.770
But be careful when
you're getting inside.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.064
It has ashes in it from a horrible day.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.316
Well, actually, we, um...
We have plans...

13:37.399 --> 13:40.694
We would be happy to help.
Right, Patrick?

13:40.778 --> 13:44.782
Right, Patrick? You'd be happy to help?
That's what she said.

13:45.950 --> 13:46.992
Right.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.214
[BETHANY] Here's your hot dog.

14:02.299 --> 14:06.595
Hey, Miranda,
um, did Uncle Jim talk to you?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.306
What the heck is going on, Mom?

14:09.390 --> 14:11.600
I didn't mean to,
and we were gonna tell you...

14:11.684 --> 14:14.186
These are supposed to have
my face on them. Hello?

14:14.270 --> 14:16.146
No one's going to buy them
if my face isn't on them.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.856
[BETHANY STAMMERS]

14:17.940 --> 14:20.317
- Sorry. I...
- Okay.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.486
- Just break it. Okay.
- [GRUNTS]

14:22.570 --> 14:23.529
Start over!

14:25.823 --> 14:27.992
Oh, my gosh. [GASPS]

14:30.035 --> 14:31.912
Kind of thought they'd be here by now.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.124
But you know these art types.
They like to feel pursued, so...

14:35.207 --> 14:36.959
Let me just give them a call.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.921
Hey, Dom, it's Kelly.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.842
Yeah, I know you blocked my number,
but I got a new one.

14:44.925 --> 14:48.137
Hey, the reason I called, wondering
if you guys are coming over today.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.347
Yeah, okay.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.975
But when you see it,
you're going to buy the whole thing.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.478
Okay, is Yoni there?

14:56.562 --> 14:58.814
Dom? Dom?

14:59.857 --> 15:02.526
Dom! Damn it.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.321
Hey, Dad, it's okay.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.280
No, it's not okay

15:06.363 --> 15:08.490
because I need people
to see your work, sweetie.

15:08.574 --> 15:13.621
People need to see your work,
and Daddy's got plenty of connections.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.414
Cheryl loves art.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.334
Hi, Cheryl. It's Kelly.

15:18.417 --> 15:22.963
Do you remember that piece of art
that we bought together?

15:23.047 --> 15:25.883
I don't think it matters
who paid for the art, Cheryl.

15:25.966 --> 15:29.845
Okay, anyway, the reason I called...

15:34.808 --> 15:36.268
She's coming right over.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.032
[THUDDING]

15:52.826 --> 15:55.579
Don't touch her again.
You're gonna mess up her hair, okay?

15:55.663 --> 15:56.914
Just leave her.

15:56.997 --> 16:00.000
Oh! Amanda, where are you going?
I don't think my butt's done yet.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.169
I... I just need to find Patrick.

16:02.252 --> 16:06.215
We have reservations for a date tonight.
I just don't wanna be late. [CHUCKLES]

16:06.298 --> 16:09.760
But, yeah, um,
thank you so much for inviting us,

16:09.843 --> 16:13.389
and letting me help by
stuffing your butt.

16:14.848 --> 16:18.102
A date? Oh, that's so fun.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.854
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

16:20.938 --> 16:23.148
Yeah, I'm really excited.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.234
Before you go,

16:25.317 --> 16:27.361
could you help me out
with the teensiest little favor?

16:27.444 --> 16:28.654
Sure, no problem.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.407
- Can you just step right this way?
- Okay.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.992
- Just have a seat.
- Oh!

16:33.075 --> 16:34.994
I just need your help so bad.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.120
Uh, what is this?

16:36.203 --> 16:39.289
Oh, I just need you to test
the Slurpee dunk tank for me.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.459
[GASPING]

16:42.543 --> 16:46.338
Aw... That's too bad.
Now you can't go on that date.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.138
Did I do something to you?

16:54.221 --> 16:55.889
Did you do something to me?

16:55.973 --> 16:57.933
Hmm, let me think about that.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.060
Yes. You stole Patrick from me.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.896
He was mine,
until you came along and seduced him,

17:02.980 --> 17:04.522
and made him take off your clothes.

17:04.606 --> 17:07.358
The worst part about it
is that it was my magic outfit. [CRIES]

17:07.443 --> 17:09.028
Wait, wait, what?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.988
It was my magic outfit he put on you.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.240
Can you believe that? The audacity!

17:13.323 --> 17:15.284
And to think I gave him a snail frame.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.953
No. I was letting him buy
that outfit back from me. We...

17:18.037 --> 17:20.580
We weren't even dating then.

17:20.664 --> 17:24.835
What? No... No, he's a cheater.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.462
Do you know Patrick?

17:27.171 --> 17:33.135
Patrick is the most honest, sweet,
loyal guy I've ever met.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.596
He would never cheat.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.140
[SIGHS]

17:38.974 --> 17:40.976
I'm sorry. I need a towel.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.614
[EMILY] Hi. Welcome.

17:53.697 --> 17:57.117
Hi, if you have any questions,
we're here to help.

17:57.201 --> 18:01.163
I might be in the wrong place.
I'm looking for Miranda bobbleheads?

18:01.246 --> 18:03.957
Really? Why?

18:04.041 --> 18:06.043
I collect bobbleheads.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.212
Miranda's gift table is outside.

18:08.295 --> 18:11.298
Well... No, no, no, no, no.
You're in the right place.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.549
Here you go. Uh...

18:12.633 --> 18:15.094
I bet you don't have
any paintings of a bobblehead,

18:15.177 --> 18:16.512
which is what we have here.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.681
Like this one.
You just look right into the painting,

18:19.765 --> 18:22.851
and you see a 3-D
bobblehead coming at you

18:22.935 --> 18:24.728
if you look just right at it.
You see that?

18:24.812 --> 18:26.522
I'm not seeing it.

18:26.605 --> 18:30.067
Okay. Well, that's because a lot of
people don't see it the first time,

18:30.150 --> 18:33.654
'cause you gotta look past it,
is the trick.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.364
And even if you never see it,

18:35.447 --> 18:37.241
your friends are gonna see it,

18:37.324 --> 18:40.661
and $500 is a small price to pay
to impress your friends.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.287
- Am I right?
- Dad?

18:42.371 --> 18:45.249
I kind of just like regular bobbleheads.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.670
Well, you're a terrible friend!

18:49.753 --> 18:51.338
Dad, what are you doing?

18:51.421 --> 18:55.300
Okay. [SIGHS] I'm just gonna go outside,
and rustle up some more business for us.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.804
Okay? This is going great.
Just how we planned.

19:01.932 --> 19:02.808
[GRUNTS]

19:04.977 --> 19:06.770
- [THUDS]
- [GROANS]

19:10.315 --> 19:11.483
Hi.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.945
Hey.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.201
Remember the last time
we were inside Uncle Jim?

19:24.746 --> 19:26.290
Yeah, I remember.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.840
You told me I was
beautiful and sweaty...

19:35.883 --> 19:37.843
and then we kissed.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.764
I should get going now.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.352
Me and Amanda have plans, so...

19:47.436 --> 19:50.606
Oh, no, she left.
I pushed her in a pool of Slurpee.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.400
You what?

19:53.984 --> 19:55.652
Pushed her in a pool of Slurpee.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.946
Listen, this has all just been
a big misunderstanding.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.489
Now we can be together.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.284
What is wrong with you?

20:02.367 --> 20:03.368
"Now"?

20:04.328 --> 20:06.371
"Now we can be together"?

20:06.455 --> 20:10.834
[SHAKILY] You've wasted
so much of my time. And I...

20:10.918 --> 20:15.547
[YELLS] I deserve someone who loves me as
much as I love them! And it's not you!

20:26.516 --> 20:27.935
[COIN CLATTERS]

20:33.106 --> 20:35.484
Hey, did you tell Miranda about us?

20:35.567 --> 20:38.028
Because I can't tell
if this is just her normal aggression

20:38.111 --> 20:39.404
or if it's more like she's...

20:39.488 --> 20:42.532
What are you doing? Jim!

20:43.242 --> 20:45.869
Bethany, look at this.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.247
[EXCLAIMS]

20:48.330 --> 20:52.960
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, you did it!
You're my hero. You saved the house.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.128
House? No, no, no.

20:55.212 --> 21:00.550
This money is to buy a bank
and finish the Five Phase Plan.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.262
How are we gonna get to Broadway
if we use this money for rent?

21:03.345 --> 21:07.432
Jim, we're not going to New York.
We need this money.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.351
Oh... I see what this is about.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.729
You know what you should do about
your money problems, is talk to Kelly.

21:12.813 --> 21:13.981
Oh, Jim.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.900
No. He is good with finances,
and he gives great advice.

21:16.984 --> 21:20.654
Just today I told him about us,
and I decided not to tell Miranda.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.239
Why would you tell Kelly about us?

21:22.322 --> 21:24.449
Oh, don't worry.
He's not in love with you anymore.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.077
Besides, he says he has a glass stove.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.996
No! No!

21:29.079 --> 21:31.790
If Miranda finds out about us
from Kelly, it'll be a nightmare.

21:31.873 --> 21:36.837
So now I have to go tell her myself
before Kelly opens his big mouth.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.550
Kelly's got a perfect-size mouth.

21:48.598 --> 21:51.101
Miranda, what's wrong?

21:52.811 --> 21:54.938
Oh, sweetie, come here, come here.

21:58.233 --> 22:01.528

- [SNIFFLING]

22:03.780 --> 22:05.282
There, there, Miranda.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.951
It's not a sad thing
your mother and I are in love.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.287
- Jim. Jim, no...
- It's a happy thing. No, no.

22:10.370 --> 22:13.415
I'm just glad that now we can laugh
about all the sneaking around

22:13.498 --> 22:17.085
and lying directly to your face that
we've been doing. It's a good thing.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.797
What? Is this some sort of joke?

22:21.882 --> 22:25.135
- No. It's true.

22:45.238 --> 22:49.367
Miranda, the trip to New York
has been postponed.

money to pay for rent.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.642
Go away. [SNIFFLES]

23:15.852 --> 23:17.354
[SIGHS]

23:17.437 --> 23:22.484
You know, I heard about Jim and my wife.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.277
I think it's pretty weird.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.867
You know, they betrayed both of us.

23:31.952 --> 23:35.831
