["Our Lips Are Sealed"
by The Go-Go's playing]

01:07.134 --> 01:09.601
<i> ¶ Can you hear them? ¶</i>

01:09.603 --> 01:11.336
<i> ¶ They talk about us ¶</i>

01:11.338 --> 01:14.506
<i> ¶ Telling lies,</i>
<i> Well, that's no surprise ¶</i>

01:14.508 --> 01:16.175
<i> ¶ Can you see them?¶</i>

01:16.177 --> 01:19.244
<i> ¶ See right through them ¶</i>

01:19.246 --> 01:23.115
<i> ¶ They have no shield</i>
<i> Have no secrets to reveal ¶</i>

01:23.117 --> 01:26.285
<i> ¶ It doesn't matter</i>
<i> What they say ¶</i>

01:26.287 --> 01:29.088
<i> ¶ In the jealous games</i>
<i> People play ¶</i>

01:29.090 --> 01:30.656
<i> ¶ Hey, hey ¶</i>

01:32.293 --> 01:34.493
<i> ¶ Our lips are sealed ¶</i>

01:36.197 --> 01:38.330
<i> ¶ There's a weapon ¶</i>

01:38.332 --> 01:40.199
<i> ¶ That we must use ¶</i>

01:40.201 --> 01:42.134
<i> ¶ In our defense ¶</i>

01:42.136 --> 01:43.435
<i> ¶ Silence ¶</i>

01:43.437 --> 01:45.404
<i> ¶ Well, just look at them ¶</i>

01:45.406 --> 01:47.606
<i> ¶ Look right through them ¶</i>

01:47.608 --> 01:49.708
<i> ¶ That's when</i>
<i> They'll disappear ¶</i>

01:49.710 --> 01:52.344
<i>¶ That's when we lose the fear ¶</i>

01:52.346 --> 01:55.514
<i> ¶ It doesn't matter</i>
<i> What they say ¶</i>

01:55.516 --> 01:58.517
<i> ¶ In the jealous games</i>

01:58.519 --> 02:00.252
<i> ¶ Hey, hey ¶</i>

02:01.689 --> 02:02.754
<i> ¶ Our lips are sealed ¶</i>

02:06.727 --> 02:10.596
<i> ¶ Hush, my darling, ¶</i>

02:10.598 --> 02:14.333
<i> ¶ Don't you cry ¶</i>

02:14.335 --> 02:18.170
<i> ¶ Guardian angel, ¶</i>

02:18.172 --> 02:20.806
<i> ¶ Forget their lies ¶</i>

02:20.808 --> 02:23.242
<i> ¶ Can you hear them? ¶</i>

02:23.244 --> 02:25.144
<i> ¶ They talk about us ¶</i>

02:25.146 --> 02:28.213
<i> ¶ Telling lies,</i>
<i> Well, that's no surprise ¶</i>

02:28.215 --> 02:29.915
<i> ¶ Can you see them? ¶</i>

02:29.917 --> 02:32.651
<i> ¶ See right through them ¶</i>

02:32.653 --> 02:36.788
<i> ¶ They have no shield</i>
<i> Have no secrets to reveal ¶</i>

02:36.790 --> 02:40.192

<i> ¶ Our lips are sealed ¶</i>

03:00.881 --> 03:04.216
[light music]

03:07.555 --> 03:10.422
[Emma] <i> Every single one of us</i>
<i> has a secret in our world</i>

03:10.424 --> 03:13.258
<i> that we don't want</i>
<i> anyone else to see.</i>

03:14.962 --> 03:18.497
<i>And we think if people find out</i>
<i> who we really are,</i>

03:18.499 --> 03:20.265
<i> they won't stick around.</i>

03:21.268 --> 03:22.935
<i>So we make our way through life</i>

03:22.937 --> 03:25.204
<i> trying to hide</i>
<i> our vulnerabilities.</i>

03:25.906 --> 03:27.406
<i> The problem is,</i>

03:27.408 --> 03:29.741
<i> that's a lot harder</i>
<i> than it sounds.</i>

03:29.743 --> 03:33.812
<i> And sometimes it works,</i>
<i> and sometimes it doesn't,</i>

03:33.814 --> 03:35.514
<i> but at the end of the day,</i>

03:35.516 --> 03:38.684
<i> we're all just trying</i>
<i> to do the best we can.</i>

03:38.686 --> 03:39.952
<i> Take me for example.</i>

03:39.954 --> 03:41.987
<i> I pretend to know</i>
<i> what I'm doing,</i>

03:41.989 --> 03:43.822
<i> but I am so far</i>
<i> from figuring out</i>

03:43.824 --> 03:45.257
<i> what life is all about.</i>

03:45.259 --> 03:46.758
[Doug] Couple things
I wanna talk about.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.895
Logistical, formative alliances.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.797
Absolutely.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.698
[Emma] <i> Let alone what this guy</i>
<i> is trying to say.</i>

03:53.701 --> 03:56.501
<i> But I do know</i>
<i> I have to land this account</i>

03:56.503 --> 03:58.453
<i> to get my promotion.</i>

03:58.454 --> 04:00.404
<i> Or my future</i>
<i> could very well end up</i>

04:00.407 --> 04:02.841
<i> looking like that.</i>

04:02.843 --> 04:05.410
[Doug] Chuck?
You got anything to add?

04:05.412 --> 04:07.446
You good? All right.
Chuck's good.

04:07.448 --> 04:11.250
The point is, unfortunately,
uh, after rebranding,

04:11.252 --> 04:12.918
these products
are just incompatible.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.954
And our, our clientele,
they just...

04:15.956 --> 04:17.522
-they can't pay--
-Sorry. Uh...

04:17.524 --> 04:20.259
-Doug.
-Yes?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.995
Um, I don't want to...
Just to do... I'm just, uh...

04:22.997 --> 04:25.530
Just recap the situation?

04:25.532 --> 04:26.965
Oh, okay. A little recap.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.434
Chuck, let's see what you got.
Recapping?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.837
[Doug] Okay.
This is what we got.

04:31.839 --> 04:36.642
We don't like your prices.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.010
-My pricings?
-Yes.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.446
I don't... but I...

04:41.448 --> 04:43.815
I don't price anything.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.584
Okay. We're... We're done.
I think...

04:45.586 --> 04:47.419
-Wait. No, hold on.
-Well, it's time to go.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.388
I just have two points to make.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.689
-[Emma] Um...
-[Chuck sighs]

04:51.425 --> 04:52.524
[exhales sharply]

04:54.828 --> 04:58.797
Panda Prime
is an organic energy drink.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.967
Panda is a marketing phenomenon.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.336
The Panda character
is known around the world,

05:04.338 --> 05:06.571
and that slogan, "Don't Pause",

05:06.573 --> 05:08.073
has made it into the dictionary.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.842
We are offering
Shoreview Cruises

05:10.844 --> 05:13.011
an exclusive opportunity to join

05:13.013 --> 05:16.048
with this premium,
world famous brand.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.949
When customers buy Panda Prime,

05:17.951 --> 05:19.651
they are saying
that they will settle

05:19.653 --> 05:21.386
for nothing but the best.

05:21.388 --> 05:24.690
They expect the best
from their energy drink.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.426
-[sighs]
-[Emma] They expect the best

05:27.428 --> 05:28.994
from their cruise.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.396
And they expect the best
from themselves.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.931
[sighs]

05:33.701 --> 05:35.100
[clicks tongue]
I, um...

05:35.102 --> 05:36.768
I hate to burst your bubble.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.003
[Doug] That was a great speech.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.105
That was really, really,
really good speech,

05:40.107 --> 05:43.442
but have you seen our clientele?

05:43.444 --> 05:44.509
Right behind me.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.577
[Doug] Right over here.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.013
Take a look at 'em.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.580
And I don't wanna say
we're proud,

05:49.583 --> 05:50.816
but we're not ashamed.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.785
Look, when Panda customers
open this can,

05:53.787 --> 05:55.721
-they're saying who they are.
-[thuds]

05:55.723 --> 05:57.089
They're making a statement.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.591
I am asking Shoreview Cruises

05:59.593 --> 06:01.460
to make that same statement.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.594
[fizzing]

06:02.596 --> 06:03.995
Shit!
[gasps]

06:03.997 --> 06:07.366
[Emma and Doug gasp]

06:07.368 --> 06:08.500
[whimpers]

06:09.036 --> 06:10.902
Please don't tell my boss.

06:12.639 --> 06:15.374
[light music]

06:17.978 --> 06:19.678
[man on PA]
<i>This is the final boarding call</i>

06:19.680 --> 06:23.648

<i> service to Chicago...</i>

06:24.051 --> 06:24.950
Hey.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.919
Hey. Hey, how'd it go?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.856
It was a certifiable disaster.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.592
You realize this is my third job
in four years.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.926
[Lissy sighs]
<i> Sweetie.</i>

06:34.928 --> 06:36.828
I'm, I'm sorry.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.930
-And I'm boarding soon.
-[Lissy] <i> Remember.</i>

06:38.932 --> 06:41.666
Thousands of people
fly every day.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.602
-Yeah.
-[Lissy] <i> It's like...</i>

06:43.604 --> 06:45.103
safer than lying down in bed.

06:45.105 --> 06:49.007
Great. I'll remember that
when I'm sleeping tonight.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.176
[Emma whispers]
Excuse me, can I? Thank you.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.780
[thunder rumbling]

06:54.782 --> 06:55.847
-[Emma] Hi.
-[flight attendant 1] Hi.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.115
How you doing?

06:58.452 --> 06:59.718
I'm in 32F.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.154
Hasn't been your day, has it?

07:02.723 --> 07:04.089
No, not really.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.492
How about an upgrade
to first class?

07:08.562 --> 07:09.961
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.997
-[Emma] Okay.
-Seat 2A.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.000
[Emma] Thank you.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.668
-[woman 1] Hi.
-[flight attendant 2] Champagne?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.037
[woman 1] Thanks.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.739
[flight attendant 1] Hello.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.875
[gasps, chuckles]

07:23.877 --> 07:25.510
[flight attendant 2]
Champagne, miss?

07:25.512 --> 07:26.745
[flight attendant 3]
<i> Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

07:26.747 --> 07:28.046
-Champagne?
-Yes!

07:28.715 --> 07:29.915
Thank you.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.116
[flight attendant 3]

Champagne, miss?

07:36.657 --> 07:37.722
Your champagne, sir.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.526
All right, cheers.

07:41.528 --> 07:42.761
Cheers!

07:42.763 --> 07:44.596
[in soft voice]
It's my phone.

07:44.598 --> 07:45.964
Uh, yeah, no, no. I'm here.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.584
Somebody thought
I was talking to them.

07:48.585 --> 07:51.203
Um, yeah, so I'll see you
guys, uh, next month.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.739
[light music]

07:55.476 --> 07:57.709
[whirring]

08:00.747 --> 08:01.780
Excuse me, ma'am.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.482
Uh, that's unacceptable.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.016
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.185
Uh, good evening, sir.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.488
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.123
-[sighs]
-Would you be interested in, um,

08:12.125 --> 08:13.959
the new business class
lounge at JFK?

08:13.961 --> 08:14.993
-Oh, no. Thanks.
-[rumbles]

08:14.995 --> 08:16.828
-[yelps]
-[Emma] Oh, my god.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.219
Is that normal?

08:18.220 --> 08:19.609
-[crowd gasp]
-[man 1] Oh, my god!

08:19.610 --> 08:20.999
-Did we hit something?
-[flight attendant 4] Uh...

08:21.001 --> 08:24.269
We're currently experiencing
some slight turbulence.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.004
Please remain seated
until the captain

08:26.006 --> 08:28.139
has turned off
the fasten seatbelt sign.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.908
<i>[captain]This is your captain.</i>
<i> Hold on.</i>

08:29.910 --> 08:31.276
-<i> We're gonna be...</i>
-Oh, shit!

-[captain speaking indistinctly]
-[screaming]

08:32.712 --> 08:33.778
Oh, my god!

08:33.780 --> 08:35.614
[Emma] This is it.
We're gonna die!

08:35.616 --> 08:38.049
No, no. Yeah, yeah.
It's just some turbulence.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.150
What do you think
they're gonna say?

08:39.152 --> 08:40.919
They're not gonna say
"This is it.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.687
You're all gonna die" That would
make everyone freak out!

08:42.688 --> 08:43.755
This is it, though.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.023
[passengers screaming]

08:45.024 --> 08:46.290
[Emma] I haven't done anything
with my life!

08:46.293 --> 08:47.993
[sobbing]
I haven't done anything!

08:47.995 --> 08:50.629
I haven't climbed a mountain.
I've never had kids.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.797
I never got a tattoo.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.933
I don't even know
if I have a G-spot.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.568
-Excuse me?
-[Emma] I think that I'm someone

08:56.570 --> 08:58.270
that I don't have one of those.

08:58.272 --> 09:00.972
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I just say that out loud?

09:00.974 --> 09:02.807
That's okay.
You can keep talking.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.110
[passengers screaming]

09:05.112 --> 09:06.745
[Emma] My career's a joke.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.080
I just messed up
my first big meeting

09:09.082 --> 09:10.882
and I'm not gonna get
a promotion.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.151
And there's this awful girl
named Artemis...

09:13.153 --> 09:15.220
[Emma] <i> She got a promotion</i>
<i> over me,</i>

09:15.222 --> 09:19.624
<i> and so I water her stupid</i>
<i>spider plant with orange juice.</i>

09:19.626 --> 09:21.927
<i> I wish that I could pee</i>
<i> standing up.</i>

09:21.929 --> 09:24.696
I wish that I knew what
it was like to have a penis.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.098
[screaming]

09:27.100 --> 09:29.100
[Emma] <i> Every single time</i>
<i> I hear "Demons"</i>

09:29.102 --> 09:32.003
<i> by Imagine Dragons,</i>
<i> I cry instantly.</i>

09:32.005 --> 09:34.606
Even thinking about it
makes me cry.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.107
<i> And my boyfriend, Connor,</i>

09:36.109 --> 09:38.009
<i> he's obsessed with jazz.</i>

09:38.011 --> 09:39.878
<i> And he took me</i>
<i> to all these jazz concerts,</i>

09:39.880 --> 09:41.279
<i> and I pretend to like it</i>

09:41.281 --> 09:42.581
<i> but I hate jazz.</i>

09:42.583 --> 09:43.615
I hate jazz.

09:43.617 --> 09:44.749

09:44.751 --> 09:46.284

09:46.286 --> 09:47.986
<i> really weird thing</i>
<i> with his tongue,</i>

09:47.987 --> 09:49.687
<i> but I told him</i>
<i> that it was amazing...</i>

09:49.690 --> 09:52.824
<i>and that my whole body opened up</i>
<i>like a flower, and he asked...</i>

09:52.826 --> 09:54.726
[gasps]
What kind of flower?

09:54.728 --> 09:55.760
[Emma] <i> So I said...</i>

09:55.762 --> 09:57.262
Begonia?

09:57.264 --> 10:00.131
I don't think that I've ever
really been in love,

10:00.133 --> 10:03.001
and I don't think anyone's
ever really loved me.

10:03.003 --> 10:07.772
I just want, like, this huge,
amazing romance,

10:07.774 --> 10:10.308
like this, like, earthquake.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.644
Like if I could just...

10:12.646 --> 10:13.829
-Excuse me.
-[beeps]

10:13.830 --> 10:15.013
[flight attendant 2]
<i> Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

10:15.015 --> 10:18.116
-What?
-Sorry. We, we landed.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.368
What?

10:19.369 --> 10:20.619
[flight attendant 2]
<i> If you checked baggage,</i>

10:20.620 --> 10:21.870
<i> you can pick it up</i>
<i> at carousel...</i>

10:21.871 --> 10:23.121
Turbulence stopped
like a half hour ago.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.756
Why didn't you tell me that?

10:24.758 --> 10:27.092
Seems like you had a few things
to get off your chest.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.394
Oh, my god! Oh, my god.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.895
Okay.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.197
I have to go.

10:32.666 --> 10:33.765
Oh.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.168
[car revving]

10:41.675 --> 10:43.274
Emma! You're alive!

10:43.777 --> 10:45.010
Connor.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.646
[panting]

10:47.648 --> 10:50.382
-[Connor sighs]
-Mmm.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.851
-I missed you.
-Me too.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.185
[Connor] What happened to you?

10:54.187 --> 10:55.920
Just a little turbulence.

10:55.922 --> 10:59.691
Turbulence?
No, I got your text that said...

10:59.693 --> 11:01.826
"We're in a death spiral,
not gonna make it.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.862
Know that I loofah you."

11:03.864 --> 11:05.096
I mean, I know what that meant.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.898
I just wanna go home.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.701
Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.103
Oh, oh, Emma.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.305
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.774
I, I've been thinking...

11:16.843 --> 11:18.426
I'm thinking that it's time

11:18.427 --> 11:20.010
that we take our relationship
to the next level.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.447
Emma...

11:24.918 --> 11:26.418
we should move in together.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.121
Well?

11:30.791 --> 11:32.157
[Emma] Okay.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.727
[sobbing]

11:36.797 --> 11:38.096
Oh.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.432
Oh, you're very sad. Okay.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.200
Okay. Yeah. That's okay.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.335
-[whimpers]
-It's okay, baby. It's okay.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.004
Let's go in,
let's go in the car.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.172
-Let's go in the car.
-[Emma sobbing]

11:47.174 --> 11:50.308
Jeez, how bad was the flight?
[chuckles]

11:50.310 --> 11:51.776
There you go, okay.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.812
There's a quiet,
safe place to cry.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.380
-Tootsies in.
-[car door closes]

11:56.416 --> 11:58.483
[upbeat jazz music]

12:10.464 --> 12:12.330
[Connor] Like a little angel.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.398
[Emma grunts]

12:15.202 --> 12:18.903
You look so heavenly perfect.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.306
[snoring]

12:21.308 --> 12:23.475
I wanna die
in each other's arms.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.176
[snores]
Oh, shit!

12:25.178 --> 12:28.179
I can't believe I get to wake up
to this every morning.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.280
[Emma] What?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.416
When you move in!

12:31.952 --> 12:34.319
Oh, yeah. Right.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.321
-[Connor] Espresso?
-Oh, yeah.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.989
[groans]
Pronto.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.426
[Connor] <i> ¶ Doo-doo-doo-doo ¶</i>

12:42.929 --> 12:45.797
I got this new
Colombian blend. It is...

12:45.799 --> 12:47.065
to die for.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.834
-Yeah?
-Oh. Almost forgot to tell you.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.302
Guess what I got tickets for?

12:53.206 --> 12:55.340
[Connor]
The Bjorn Svornson Quartet.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.360
Wow.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.811
It's gonna be
their last show of the year.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.846
That's great.

13:01.848 --> 13:04.382
Almost forgot the saucers.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.518
But we need them
because if you spill in the bed,

13:06.520 --> 13:07.852
I will be very upset.

13:07.854 --> 13:08.920
[Emma chuckles softly]

13:08.922 --> 13:10.155
[chuckling]

13:10.157 --> 13:11.990
[sighs]

13:12.926 --> 13:16.327
Here comes the espresso train.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.796
Choo-choo!

13:18.465 --> 13:19.798
Madame.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.965
Thank you.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.367
[Connor sighs]

13:24.204 --> 13:25.336
[groans]

13:25.338 --> 13:26.504
[slurps]

13:28.208 --> 13:29.307
Fruit.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.409
Lot of nut.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.312
[Connor] Lot of nut in this.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.282
Ooh.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.385
[clicks tongue]
That's smooth.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.953
[Connor] I'll see you
at the office.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.588
I've got to do a two.

13:43.590 --> 13:47.058
-[Connor] <i> ¶ Doo-doo-doo-doo ¶</i>
-[groans]

13:48.128 --> 13:49.361
[Casey] <i> I was up till midnight</i>

13:49.362 --> 13:50.595
-<i> caulking her tub.</i>
-[Emma] <i> Ugh.</i>

13:50.597 --> 13:52.530
[Casey] She's not using me,
is she?

13:52.532 --> 13:54.199
Well, of course she's using you.

13:54.201 --> 13:58.169
She's just...
looking for a free handyman.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.105
Yeah, I should have realized.
She asked me on our first date

14:01.107 --> 14:03.341
if I had plumbing
or roofing experience.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.343
[sighs]
I have the worst taste in women.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.046
No, no you don't.
It's not your fault.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.114
I mean, how are you
supposed to know?

14:10.116 --> 14:11.516
-There's no way to know.
-[Casey sighs]

14:11.518 --> 14:13.218
I'm not gonna cry at work.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.919
[Emma] I'll be there for you.
If you really need to.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.487
But let's do it privately
this time.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.093
[indistinct chatter]

14:22.963 --> 14:25.230
[Emma] What the heck
is going on?

14:25.599 --> 14:27.398
Hey, Nick.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.401
What's going on?

14:30.403 --> 14:31.903
Jack Harper's visiting.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.238
[Emma] Who?

14:33.240 --> 14:34.923
Are you serious?

14:34.924 --> 14:36.607
Well, he only co-founded
the company you work for.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.077
I thought he had a breakdown
after Pete Laddler died?

14:39.079 --> 14:41.379
Well, looks like he's back
in the game.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.615
-[Casey] That's gotta be him.
-[Nick] Yeah.

14:43.617 --> 14:45.283
That's gotta be him.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.252
Are you being sarcastic?

14:47.254 --> 14:48.620
-You know...
-[shushes]

14:48.622 --> 14:50.288
[Cybill] Corrigan!

14:51.491 --> 14:53.024
Okay, stay strong.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.360
Good luck.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.098
Hi.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.400
Did you forget to take your meds
or something?

15:02.402 --> 15:03.968
-No.
-[Cybill] I'm...

15:03.970 --> 15:05.637
just trying to understand
the phone call

15:05.639 --> 15:07.171
I just got from Chicago.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.440
I mean, is this some kind
of psychotic break

15:09.442 --> 15:10.608
that we're dealing with?

15:10.610 --> 15:12.110
Is this a manic state?

15:12.112 --> 15:14.479
Some Kanye
at The White House shit?

15:14.481 --> 15:15.613
What the fuck happened

15:15.615 --> 15:17.782
-to Shoreview?
-Nothing.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.950
Did you really pour a drink
on Doug Hamilton?

15:19.953 --> 15:22.120
No. It was like a tiny
little bit of spray.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.621
Like, I was gesticulating
with the can.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.391
I was passionate about,
the, the product. And I just...

15:26.393 --> 15:28.993
-I was just like gesticulating.
-Were you... were you doing this

15:28.995 --> 15:30.094
in the meeting?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.613
I just, it got shook up.

15:31.614 --> 15:33.131
-Stop doing that with your hand!
-[Emma] It just...

15:33.133 --> 15:34.565
It was like that much, though.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.967
-Shh.
-Okay.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.168
Just clean up your desk.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.670
-What?
-You're firing me? I--

15:38.672 --> 15:40.638
Learn to listen, Corrigan.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.174
I said clean it up, not out.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.376
[Cybill] Jack Harper
will be here in a few minutes.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.512
And if you spill
Panda Prime on him,

15:47.514 --> 15:48.713
then you're fucking gone.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.015
-[Emma] I'm not gonna spill--
-Shh!

15:54.387 --> 15:55.553
Okay, everyone.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.322
Listen up!

15:57.324 --> 15:59.657
[Cybill]
This is an informal visit,

15:59.659 --> 16:01.225
nothing more.

16:01.227 --> 16:05.463
Mr. Harper will come in,
maybe talk to one or two of you,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.632
so act normal...

16:12.539 --> 16:14.356
[in soft voice]
...just better.

16:14.357 --> 16:16.174
Not a really great meeting
for you, was it there, Emma?

16:16.176 --> 16:17.826
Savage.

16:17.827 --> 16:19.477
[Artemis] Cybill's not really
liking you today.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.112
[Nick and Artemis chuckle]

16:21.114 --> 16:22.647
Okay, everyone.
He's on the floor.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.349
So go about your everyday task.

16:25.518 --> 16:26.617
Now!

16:27.320 --> 16:28.453
[sighs]

16:29.756 --> 16:31.255
[sniffs]

16:33.193 --> 16:34.625
[sighs]

16:35.528 --> 16:37.495
[Cybill] Jack.

16:37.497 --> 16:43.001
Everyone, may I have
your attention, please.

16:43.003 --> 16:46.371
It is my distinct honor
and pleasure to introduce...

16:46.373 --> 16:47.739
our founding father.

16:47.741 --> 16:51.209
The man who has
influenced and inspired

16:51.211 --> 16:53.611
an entire generation
of marketers.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.213
The inimitable...

16:55.548 --> 16:56.748
Jack Harper.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.383
[cheers and applause]

17:00.787 --> 17:03.354
Thank you, Cybill. Everybody.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.771
And who's this?

17:04.772 --> 17:06.189
[Cybill] Ah.
This is Emma Corrigan.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.291
One of our junior
marketing assistants.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.261
Hi, Emma.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.229
Hello, Mr. Harper.
It's very nice to meet you.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.198
[Jack]
Uh, it's nice to meet you.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.201
Show the man who you are.
[chuckles]

17:17.203 --> 17:20.070
[Jack] Now, Emma,
what, what do you do, Emma?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.640
I work in the marketing
department.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.076
Emma was just in Chicago
on business.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.577
We try to give our junior staff

17:26.579 --> 17:28.679
responsibilities
early as possible.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.381
[Jack] That's a great idea.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.616
I could use a coffee.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.284
How's, how's the coffee here?

17:34.254 --> 17:37.588
The coffee is absolute poison.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.324
It's fricking terrible!

17:41.761 --> 17:43.594
[coughs]
It's...

17:44.431 --> 17:45.663
It's delicious.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.799
That's great. Good to hear.

17:47.801 --> 17:50.134
[Cybill] And this
is Artemis Harrington,

17:50.136 --> 17:52.503
one of our brightest
young executives.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.771
-Hi, sir.
-Hi.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.506
-Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?
-[chuckles]

17:55.508 --> 17:57.375
Yes. Bonjour.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.311
-[Jack] Oh, you're French.
-Two percent.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.448
Well, um, I like your,
I like your spider plant.

18:03.817 --> 18:05.683
Thank you, sir.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.752
It's, um, looks very healthy.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.554
[Cybill] And this is Nick.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.290
He's another one of our
junior marketing executives.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.825
-Mr. Harper.
-Nice to meet you.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.526
-Call me Nicky.
-[Jack] Um...

18:15.528 --> 18:19.797
Well, I'm sure I'll get to meet
all of you at some point,

18:19.799 --> 18:21.950
and, uh...

18:21.951 --> 18:24.102
look forward to getting to know
some of you a little bit better.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.369
[Cybill] Right this way, Jack.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.207
Au revoir!

18:30.410 --> 18:31.876
You're from Pittsburgh.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.446
[keyboard clacking]

18:41.387 --> 18:43.521
-Hi.
-[Emma] Hi.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.655
[clicks tongue]

18:44.657 --> 18:46.657
So...
[chuckles]

18:46.659 --> 18:48.526
[Jack] So...

18:48.528 --> 18:50.528
-[exhales sharply]
-[Jack chuckles softly]

18:50.530 --> 18:52.196
What a coincidence.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.898
-It's good to see you again.
-Yeah.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.634
-How are you?
-I, I'm good. How are you?

18:56.636 --> 18:57.869
[Emma] Good.

18:58.872 --> 19:03.141
The world works
in such mysterious ways.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.308
-Yeah.
-[Emma] Doesn't it?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.811
-It does.
-[chuckles]

19:06.813 --> 19:08.312
[smacks lips]
So...

19:08.314 --> 19:11.315
Jack... Harp... Mr. Harper...

19:11.317 --> 19:13.851
In my defense,
I had no idea who you were.

19:13.853 --> 19:17.155
So I don't think
that I should...

19:17.457 --> 19:19.390
be peen-alized.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.593
You, you don't think
I should penalize you?

19:22.595 --> 19:24.328
Is that how you pronounce it?

19:24.697 --> 19:25.930
Pen... penalized?

19:25.932 --> 19:28.266
The penalty flag,
not a "peenalty" flag

19:28.268 --> 19:30.935
Right. Now that you say it,
"peenalized",

19:30.937 --> 19:32.403
-It's weird.
-[Jack chuckles]

19:32.405 --> 19:34.672
-[Jack] I, uh...
-It's like "penis". Sorry.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.541
Neither of us are wrong.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.808
[sighs]
You're gonna fire me.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.327
Please don't fire me.

19:39.328 --> 19:40.845
-I'm gonna like--
-I'm not gonna fire you.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.414
Great. Great. Thank you.
[sighs]

19:43.416 --> 19:46.551
[Jack] But I am gonna ask
for a favor.

19:46.553 --> 19:49.887
I would really like it if nobody
knew that I was in Chicago.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.722
Do you think we could
keep that between us?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.057
Yeah.

19:53.058 --> 19:54.391
-[Jack] Yeah?
-Of course. Of course.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.960
-You haven't told anybody?
-[Emma] No.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.495
No. I'm like a steel trap.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.397
Like, nothing goes in
and nothing comes out.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.532
[Emma] Well stuff goes in,
it's like...

20:01.534 --> 20:04.302
like one of these, you know?

20:04.304 --> 20:06.254
It's like a...

20:06.255 --> 20:08.205
Venus fly trap.
Like you get in there,

20:08.208 --> 20:09.507
and then...
[grunts]

20:09.509 --> 20:10.575
you die in there.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.276
In like...
[inhales sharply]

20:12.278 --> 20:15.413
So it all goes in
and it dies in here.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.248
-I feel very safe.
-[Emma] Good.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.482
-Yeah.
-And the same thing goes

20:18.484 --> 20:20.284
for you, though, like...

20:20.286 --> 20:22.520
everything I said...
[sighs]

20:22.522 --> 20:24.689
Dies with me. To the grave.

20:24.691 --> 20:25.957
So...
[clicks tongue]

20:25.959 --> 20:29.694
We're both dying
with each other's secrets.

20:29.696 --> 20:30.795
-[chuckles]
-[Jack] Yes.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.364
That's quite intimate.
[clears throat]

20:35.835 --> 20:39.971
So, you've really
never been in love?

20:41.808 --> 20:42.873
[exhales sharply]

20:42.875 --> 20:44.475
Did I say that?

20:44.477 --> 20:46.510
No, I didn't, right?

20:46.512 --> 20:48.813
Oh, I mean...

20:48.815 --> 20:51.482
I mean, who really even knows
what love is?

20:51.484 --> 20:54.952
No one has any goddamn idea
what love is

20:54.954 --> 20:57.688
on this entire planet.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.258
And I'll tell you that,
as a fact.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.359
Mm-hm.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.635
[upbeat music]

21:14.707 --> 21:16.374
[Emma] Lissy?

21:16.376 --> 21:17.441
[thuds]

21:21.781 --> 21:24.048
Hey, Lissy. Need to talk to you.

21:24.817 --> 21:25.950
-[Lissy] Emma.
-[Emma] Hey.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.251
-Hi.
-[Lissy] You're early.

21:27.252 --> 21:28.551
[Lissy] You're home.
You're home early.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.321
[Emma] Oh, hi. Hi.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.856
-[Lissy] This is, um...
-[Emma] So sorry.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.357
-This is Omar.
-Hi.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.393
-Hi.
-Um, Emma, my roommate.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.428
-Hi, pleasure to meet you.
-Hi. Yeah, you too.

21:37.430 --> 21:40.798
Omar and I were just reviewing
some case notes.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.300
-Cool. That's fun.
-Mm-hm.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.335
Yeah, it's fun, but it's work.

21:44.337 --> 21:47.672
And we're, we're just swamped
at work, aren't we?

21:47.674 --> 21:49.440
-Of course. Mm-hm.
-Yeah.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.975
-So...
-Yeah.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.477
Well, you know, I think we got
to a good place.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.578
We can pick it up tomorrow.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.963
-Yeah.
-Okay, I should be going now.

21:55.964 --> 21:57.347
-See you tomorrow.
-Great, nice meeting you.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.616
-Yeah, you too.
-Yeah.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.685
Have a really good day.

22:00.687 --> 22:01.819
[Lissy sighs]

22:01.821 --> 22:04.422
[door opens, closes]

22:04.424 --> 22:05.956
Wow.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.558
-So...
-[Lissy] He's new.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.694
He's, yeah, I'm kind of,
showing him the ropes.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.430
-Great.
-Yeah, great.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.099
He's like, kind of, ripped
for a lawyer.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.368
-Is he?
-You didn't notice that?

22:17.370 --> 22:19.637
-[Lissy] Well...
-That he was, uh, attractive?

22:19.639 --> 22:21.356
Yeah, I guess he is.

22:21.357 --> 22:23.074
I guess he is.
I just see him so much at work,

22:23.076 --> 22:26.444
I guess I'm used to, like,
his physique.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.878
Totally. I believe you.

22:27.880 --> 22:28.979
-That looks good.
-[Emma] Yeah.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.414
You look like you need it.

22:31.617 --> 22:33.617
Is there a man here?

22:33.618 --> 22:35.618
[Gemma] I thought I, like,
smelled a presence or something.

22:35.621 --> 22:36.721
-He left.
-[Lissy] Yeah.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.823
He's my co-worker.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.591
[Gemma sighs]
Did you finish the quiz?

22:40.593 --> 22:42.176
Yeah.

22:42.177 --> 22:43.760
-What quiz?
-[Lissy] It's this article.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.430
Says that proportions of beauty
have always been the same,

22:46.432 --> 22:50.568
so you can figure out
how beautiful you are.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.602
Scientifically.

22:51.604 --> 22:52.870
What did you get?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.438
I'm a 33.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.407
Out of what?

22:56.408 --> 22:58.375
-A hundred.
-That's ridiculous.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.511
[Gemma] I think 33
is pretty good for you.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.713
Scientifically.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.015
[Emma] Gemma, what did you get?

23:05.017 --> 23:06.884
[sighs]
Eighty-nine.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.953
And that's without all this.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.590
So dumb. You are so stunning.

23:12.592 --> 23:13.991
That's insanity.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.494
[Gemma slurps, gulps]

23:19.465 --> 23:20.765
Whatever.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.066
I'm going to a bris.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.735
[sighs]
Night, ladies.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.137
[door opens, closes]

23:26.139 --> 23:28.706
[Lissy] No shoes
in the apartment!

23:28.708 --> 23:30.941
God, that outfit is hideous.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.910
You're not gonna believe
what happened today.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.362
[Lissy] What?

23:34.363 --> 23:35.813
You remember that guy,
the guy from the plane?

23:35.815 --> 23:37.014
The one you spilled
your guts to?

23:37.016 --> 23:39.717
Mm-hm.
He showed up at work today.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.652
-Like, stalking you?
-[Emma] No.

23:41.654 --> 23:44.455
He's the top guy at the company.

23:44.457 --> 23:45.723
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.592
[Lissy] Wait, I thought
that guy died?

23:48.594 --> 23:49.827
Mm-mm.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.095
No, that's the other guy.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.998
But this guy fell apart
after Pete died.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.166
-Hmm.
-[Emma] They were like brothers.

23:55.168 --> 23:58.002
Anyway, I told him
all of my secrets.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.603
Like, I told him
everything about me.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.505
I told him about...

24:01.507 --> 24:03.140
the begonia.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.742
-[groans]
-And I told him about

24:04.744 --> 24:06.043
Danny Nussbaum.

24:06.045 --> 24:10.214
He lasted for 17 seconds.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.950
-I counted.
-Oh.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.085
[chuckling]
Oh, my god.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.588
So, what?

24:17.590 --> 24:19.490
He knows a few things about you.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.058
So, what?

24:21.060 --> 24:25.129
You don't have any secrets
from me though, do you?

24:25.131 --> 24:29.600
I had a sex dream about my best
friend and roommate Lissy.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.235
It's like, in there, now.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.638
[clicks tongue, blows air]

24:36.642 --> 24:37.942
No. Of course not.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.879
So when are you gonna move in
with Connor?

24:41.881 --> 24:43.113
[Emma] Um...
[sighs]

24:43.749 --> 24:44.849
I don't know.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.684
He's still
in his pantsless phase?

24:46.686 --> 24:47.952
He is still.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.588
-Hmm.
-Connor's great.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.123
[inhales deeply]
Thing's like, thing's aren't...

24:54.126 --> 24:57.628
They're... they're not
that romantic anymore.

24:57.630 --> 25:00.531
I think that's normal for things
to kind of slow down, and...

25:01.133 --> 25:02.566
fade out a little like that.

25:02.568 --> 25:04.502
But that doesn't mean
you can't spice it up.

25:04.504 --> 25:05.603
How?

25:05.605 --> 25:07.271
What about doing it at work?

25:07.273 --> 25:11.175
With him? Like, Connor would...
I don't...

25:11.177 --> 25:13.944
It was just a suggestion.
I don't know.

25:17.783 --> 25:20.684
[upbeat music]

25:20.686 --> 25:22.520
[indistinct chatter]

25:25.291 --> 25:26.957
Oh, hello again.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.158
-Oh, sorry.
-[Emma] Sorry.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.827
-[Jack chuckles]
-[Jack and Emma] Okay.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.195
-I'm gonna...
-Yeah, okay.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.263
Thanks.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.799
[Cybill] Everyone.

25:35.801 --> 25:37.735
Jack will be observing
what we do,

25:37.737 --> 25:39.236
see how we operate as a team.

25:39.238 --> 25:43.040
And before I forget,
thank you, team...

25:43.042 --> 25:46.277
for coming out
to last week's family picnic.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.013
It truly meant the world to me.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.081
And it was
an incredible opportunity

25:51.083 --> 25:52.950
for us to meet
each other's families

25:52.952 --> 25:57.221
and to have what I like to call,
good old-fashioned fun.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.160
[in soft voice]
Don't fucking embarrass me.

26:05.998 --> 26:09.199
Uh, you can just ignore me.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.302
[Jack] Really. I'm not here.

26:15.007 --> 26:19.577
Hi! Yes, this is
Artemis Harrington in marketing.

26:19.579 --> 26:20.644
[Artemis] Uh-huh.

26:20.646 --> 26:23.464
Um...
[snaps fingers]

26:23.465 --> 26:26.283
Emma? Can you get me the, uh,
Costco brochure, please?

26:26.285 --> 26:27.351
[Artemis] Faster.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.853
[Artemis taps pen]

26:28.854 --> 26:30.354
[Artemis]
My assistant's coming now.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.924
I can't, I can't reach that.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.759
[Artemis] Okay, just one second.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.661
Yeah. I still can't reach it.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.697
-[grunts]
-[clatters]

26:39.699 --> 26:41.098
[Artemis] Thank you so much.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.033
That's my girl!

26:43.035 --> 26:44.935
Don't know what we would do
without her.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.637
-[Artemis] I will have this...
-[sighs]

26:46.639 --> 26:48.839
sent over to you right away.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.107
-[Artemis] Au revoir.
-[clears throat]

26:56.849 --> 27:00.284
Um, is it always this quiet?

27:00.286 --> 27:02.152
[Jack] You know, when Pete
and I were starting out,

27:02.154 --> 27:04.521
we talked about everything.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.889
Um, yeah, what we were watching,
what we were listening to,

27:06.892 --> 27:08.359
-what we were reading.
-Oh!

27:09.228 --> 27:10.961
[Jack] Yeah?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.631
I am devouring a biography

27:13.633 --> 27:17.034
on Queen Mary I of England.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.036
Also known as Bloody Mary

27:19.038 --> 27:20.704
-Wow.
-[Artemis] Yeah.

27:20.706 --> 27:22.339
She was, she was a feisty one.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.141
[thuds]

27:24.142 --> 27:25.942
I'm in the middle of a history
of 14th century tapestries.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.711
-Nice!
-It's, uh...

27:28.314 --> 27:29.880
invigorating.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.182
-Uh, what about you, Emma?
-[gasps]

27:32.184 --> 27:35.786
Weren't you reading
<i> Great Expectations...</i>

27:35.788 --> 27:38.022
in your little "book club"?

27:38.024 --> 27:40.824
I could not get through it.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.926
I could not get through it.

27:42.928 --> 27:44.261
So I just skimmed
the back cover.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.362
[snickers]

27:45.364 --> 27:46.997
Mm-hm.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.899
What, uh, what do you think?

27:48.901 --> 27:50.934
[clicks tongue]

27:50.936 --> 27:54.772
You know I, I actually,
it really resonated with me.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.708
[Jack] Which part
exactly resonated?

27:57.710 --> 28:00.411
Um, the resonances.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.247
The resonances resonated.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.848
I'm gonna,
I have to get back to work.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.050
-Yeah. No, please.
-[Emma] I'm really busy.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.317
-[Jack] Yeah. Okay.
-[Artemis] Hmm.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.422
[Casey] Sir.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.060
[chuckles]
Too bad.

28:16.062 --> 28:18.996
Uh, Casey, Mr. Harper.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.231
Uh, um...

28:22.101 --> 28:23.901
[sighs]
[Casey] I'm sorry.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.870
Oh, it's okay.
Just a fly on the wall.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.106
-Uh-huh.
-[Jack] Proceed.

28:29.108 --> 28:32.176
-Okay.
-[Emma] Don't. Don't proceed.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.628
Uh...

28:33.629 --> 28:35.079
-[mouthing]
-[Casey] I just...

28:35.081 --> 28:37.114
I, I just came to ask Emma

28:37.116 --> 28:39.316
if she wanted to go over
some numbers with me.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.919
Casey comes and he asks
if I wanna go over the numbers,

28:41.921 --> 28:43.153
but what he really means is,

28:43.155 --> 28:45.155
"Can we go sneak out
and get some coffee."

28:45.157 --> 28:46.890
I'm so busy right now.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.892
I'm really, um...

28:48.894 --> 28:51.729
This is a two-person number job.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.731
I can't do it on my own, so...

28:53.733 --> 28:55.449
-[Emma] Uh...
-Come on.

28:55.450 --> 28:57.166
Last time I, sort of,
I was, like, a hindrance.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.303
No, you're the go,
you're like a human calculator.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.438
-[Emma] Casey, just...
-It's what you are.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.407
That's, I think you should
get started on that.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.210
I, I, I think you should
go over the numbers.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.349
You think he knew?

29:13.185 --> 29:15.986
Harper? About our little system?

29:21.927 --> 29:26.230
He's, uh, he's handsome. Hm?

29:26.232 --> 29:29.366
Yeah, he's like,
boy-band handsome.

29:29.368 --> 29:32.169
He's tall, he's rich.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.037
-I hate him.
-[elevator dings]

29:34.039 --> 29:35.906
-[Casey] Jesus, Mr. Harper.
-[Emma coughs]

29:35.908 --> 29:37.174
Uh, sir.
[clears throat]

29:37.176 --> 29:38.542
Uh, how are those numbers
working out?

29:38.544 --> 29:41.345
I, uh, I don't want that one.
Okay, I'll take it.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.413
Um, you know, that's...

29:43.415 --> 29:46.917
Uh, I'm gonna take
the stairs, so I can...

29:46.919 --> 29:48.152
[chuckles]

29:48.954 --> 29:50.354
[Jack] Come on in.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.057
[elevator dings]

29:54.326 --> 29:57.060
[whirring]

30:02.802 --> 30:04.067
You know,
when we were starting out,

30:04.069 --> 30:06.403
Pete and I, we, uh,
we had a code.

30:06.405 --> 30:10.440
One of us would ask the other
to bring him the Leopold file.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.912
-The Leopold file?
-Yeah.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.080
Didn't exist. It was just a...

30:17.082 --> 30:18.816
An excuse to get away
from our desk.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.151
[elevator dings, whirs]

30:23.389 --> 30:24.454
-Hey.
-[Connor gasps]

30:24.456 --> 30:25.856
[Connor] Mr. Harper.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.925
Hi. I, I, I'm Jack Harper.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.560
Jack, uh, you're Jack Harper.

30:29.562 --> 30:31.195
I'm Connor Martin.
Market research.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.797
-Oh, yeah.
-[chuckles]

30:32.798 --> 30:34.398
I, uh, I'm on my way
to your presentation.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.000
Oh, oh. I am so excited.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.468
[Jack] Well, uh, I can't wait.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.604
[panting]

30:40.606 --> 30:42.005
[exhales]

30:42.608 --> 30:45.442
Oh, you two are an item.
Correct?

30:45.444 --> 30:46.543
Oh.

30:47.479 --> 30:48.612
[both] Yes.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.882
Do you just sense...
sense this stuff, or...

30:51.884 --> 30:53.450
[Jack] No, no, no. Um...

30:53.452 --> 30:58.155
Have you ever found Emma's
presence here distracting?

30:59.491 --> 31:01.325
Oh, no. No, sir.

31:01.327 --> 31:04.228
I, I promise that when Emma
and I are at work,

31:04.230 --> 31:07.464
she, she... we are nothing.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.383
[Connor] We are nothing.

31:09.384 --> 31:11.301
[stammers]
We might as well be two eunuchs.

31:12.605 --> 31:15.172
-[Connor] Take our parts...
-Uh-huh.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.407
put them in separate drawers.

31:17.409 --> 31:20.077
Leave them until 5:00 p.m.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.278
[smacks lips]

31:21.647 --> 31:23.080
[Jack] Great.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.448
[sighs]
Okay.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.550
Uh...

31:28.053 --> 31:29.553
[Jack] Emma,
why don't you join us?

31:34.126 --> 31:35.425
[Connor] Okay, thank you so much

31:35.427 --> 31:38.161
for joining me today
for my presentation

31:38.163 --> 31:41.465
on the evolving demographics
of Panda Bites.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.201
As you know,
Panda Bites has been doing...

31:45.938 --> 31:47.504
Badly. Very badly.

31:47.505 --> 31:49.071
But we are hoping
to maybe turn that around

31:49.074 --> 31:51.074
with, uh, some of the data
that we have gathered.

31:51.076 --> 31:54.111
So, the first thing
that you should know,

31:54.112 --> 31:57.147
is that we have discovered that
our target demographic is...

31:57.149 --> 31:58.215
[clicks]

31:58.550 --> 32:00.450
Millennials!

32:00.452 --> 32:02.152
[groans]

32:02.154 --> 32:04.321
[Connor] Let's look
at a typical millennial.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.590
[rasps]

32:08.961 --> 32:10.494
[Cybill groans]

32:10.496 --> 32:13.030
[indistinct chatter]

32:14.500 --> 32:15.699
Oh, he's got to...

32:15.701 --> 32:17.467
I wish I was in bed.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.102
[Connor] Suspenders...

32:19.104 --> 32:20.637
-[Connor] Yes.
-[yawns]

32:20.639 --> 32:21.939
[clears throat]

32:21.941 --> 32:27.110
[Connor] A guitar case.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.646
'Cause he's in a band.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.481
His shirt has a pattern.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.483
Okay, thank you so much.

32:33.485 --> 32:36.153
I think we get the picture.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.221
Um, so this is a millennial.

32:38.223 --> 32:41.258
We, uh, interviewed
1,000 of them

32:41.260 --> 32:42.943
form all across the country.

32:42.944 --> 32:44.627
And we asked them
about various aspects

32:44.630 --> 32:46.430
of Panda Bites.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.598
[Connor] What we learned
is that our, our target demo

32:48.600 --> 32:51.001
is 18 to 35.

32:51.003 --> 32:53.003
Uh, they drink Panda Prime
four times a day,

32:53.005 --> 32:54.738
they eat organic
when it's available,

32:54.740 --> 32:56.573
they go out to restaurants
on the weekends.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.442
When they ride on the train,

32:58.443 --> 33:00.310
they try to avoid
making eye contact with people.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.178
Most of them would have bought
tickets to the Fyre Festival,

33:02.181 --> 33:04.247
and most of them would've been
very upset when they found out

33:04.249 --> 33:05.382
that the Fyre Festival
wasn't actually something.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.250
[Cybill clears throat]
Are you...

33:09.254 --> 33:11.455
Wrap it up!
[chuckles]

33:11.690 --> 33:13.457
[laughing]

33:13.459 --> 33:15.692
That's basically what we know
about the demographic

33:15.694 --> 33:17.361
of the, uh, millennial.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.464
Uh, we're looking forward to,
uh, investing more resources

33:20.466 --> 33:22.366
and trying to get them
to eat Panda Bites.

33:22.368 --> 33:25.469
Does anyone, um, have anything
to say about this?

33:25.471 --> 33:28.205
I, actually, um.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.140
Corrigan, then, great.

33:30.142 --> 33:34.111
My grandpa and his friends
are obsessed with Panda Bites.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.546
They eat them, like,
three times a day.

33:36.548 --> 33:40.650
Um, so I thought, I don't know,
maybe we could ask them why.

33:40.652 --> 33:45.055
Maybe there's something there
that's not being accurately...

33:45.758 --> 33:48.158
portrayed in all of the data.

33:48.160 --> 33:52.796
But your grandpa
is not our target demographic.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.698
[Connor] I mean,

33:54.700 --> 33:57.200
does this guy look like
a grandpa?

33:57.202 --> 33:58.635
-[Artemis] Yes.
-[Connor] No, look.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.272
I think what Connor
is trying to say,

34:02.274 --> 34:04.775
is that Panda Bites
isn't performing.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.476
So we need to axe that.

34:06.478 --> 34:09.780
If we are going to maximize
concept innovation,

34:09.782 --> 34:11.547
-then we need to focus..
-[clears throat]

34:11.550 --> 34:13.650
on strategic competencies.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.587
-Could you, um...
-[Artemis] Yes.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.790
-Could you say that again.
-[Artemis] Absolutely, sir.

34:19.792 --> 34:21.558
-Um...
-Not like a Harvard Professor.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.592
-[spits]
-[Emma chuckles]

34:26.130 --> 34:28.398
From a, a strategic...

34:28.400 --> 34:31.101
Without using
the word "strategic".

34:31.103 --> 34:34.638
Uh, we should focus on...

34:35.808 --> 34:37.274
what we do...

34:38.377 --> 34:40.077
Good. Well.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.578
[Artemis] Great. Like...

34:42.147 --> 34:43.246
Yes.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.181
Perfect.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.581
I don't mean to single you out,

34:45.583 --> 34:47.617
and I appreciate
what you're doing, all of you.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.820
It's a lot.

34:49.822 --> 34:52.722
But Pete used to say,

34:52.724 --> 34:54.558
"Sometimes, you just gotta kiss.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.826
Keep it simple, stupid."

34:55.828 --> 34:57.728
[all chuckling]

34:57.729 --> 34:59.629
That's what I would like us
to do as a company.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.132
[Connor] I thought you were
saying, "We should kiss."

35:02.134 --> 35:03.300
-Thank you so much.
-No.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.668
[Connor] Thank you very much.

35:04.670 --> 35:07.404
[Jack] Ladies, thank you
for your input. Appreciate it.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.111
So, uh...

35:14.546 --> 35:16.780
-[taps]
-Artiste.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.315
It's actually pretty good.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.450
Is he the one?

35:23.255 --> 35:25.789
I know what you're thinking
and you're wrong.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.191
-You sure?
-[Emma] Yes.

35:28.193 --> 35:30.594
Are, are you convincing me
or yourself?

35:32.397 --> 35:33.630
[sighs]

35:33.632 --> 35:35.866
[upbeat music]

35:38.670 --> 35:40.670
[indistinct chatter]

35:41.406 --> 35:43.874
[upbeat music]

35:49.748 --> 35:52.182
[tapping]

35:55.420 --> 35:56.520
[dings]

35:57.422 --> 35:58.522
-[thuds]
-Ow.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.329
Hey, there.
[sighs]

36:06.665 --> 36:07.797
[Connor] What?

36:07.799 --> 36:09.766
Why are you standing like that?

36:09.768 --> 36:11.401
I want you to look at my body.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.637
Do you have like a rash
or something, or...

36:14.540 --> 36:16.306
No, I don't have...

36:16.308 --> 36:17.941
I wanna look attractive for you.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.876
I, I thought there
was some emergency.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.311
There is.

36:22.915 --> 36:24.748
[panting]
Hey.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.683
We never make love
spontaneously anymore.

36:26.685 --> 36:27.884
[both] Mmm!

36:27.886 --> 36:29.386
When did, when did we ever?

36:29.388 --> 36:30.787
-[Connor] Oh, my gosh!
-[Emma moaning]

36:30.789 --> 36:32.355
-[Connor moaning]
-Come on!

36:32.357 --> 36:33.690
Make love to me,
right here, right now.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.858
Are you crazy? No!

36:34.860 --> 36:37.627
-No, Emma!
-Well, maybe I am crazy! Like...

36:37.629 --> 36:39.796
Isn't love supposed to make you
a little bit crazy?

36:39.798 --> 36:44.334
Uh, like, you know, take off on
a Thursday crazy! Not, not this!

36:44.336 --> 36:46.870
-Emma, Emma, Emma, stop. Stop.
-What?

36:47.806 --> 36:49.539
I'm so sorry, I didn't...

36:49.541 --> 36:50.807
[Connor] Yeah.
Let's just not talk about it.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.375
I just...
[sighs]

36:52.377 --> 36:53.910
I was just trying
to get the spark back.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.512
What, what, what spark?

36:55.747 --> 36:57.214
[sighs]

36:57.916 --> 36:59.382
Oh, my god.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.552
I've been so stupid.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.771
Yeah. You think?

37:04.772 --> 37:06.989
-Sex in the archive room?
-Connor, this isn't working out.

37:07.793 --> 37:08.858
What did you expect?

37:08.860 --> 37:11.494
No. Not this, just everything.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.096
This, us.

37:13.097 --> 37:14.697
I don't think we're,
we're working.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.399
You're joking, right?

37:16.401 --> 37:17.334
[sighs]

37:17.336 --> 37:18.602
Are you breaking up with me?

37:18.604 --> 37:20.270
[Emma] Yeah.

37:20.271 --> 37:21.937
Because, because I,
I wouldn't have sex with you

37:21.940 --> 37:23.857
in the archive room?

37:23.858 --> 37:25.775
No, that's not why.
It's a bunch of reasons.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.678
I'm everything
a woman could want.

37:28.680 --> 37:32.983
I listen. I perform cunnilingus.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.586
I opened up your world to jazz.

37:36.588 --> 37:40.557
-[Connor] I'm a catch, okay?
-I know, yeah. I'm really sorry.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.592
Two, two, two seconds ago...

37:42.594 --> 37:46.396
my, my wiener was out
in my place of business.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.298
-Well, I don't know--
-And now you don't wanna be

37:48.300 --> 37:49.866
-with me.
-You put your ass out

37:49.867 --> 37:51.433
everywhere else,
I don't know what the big deal

37:51.436 --> 37:52.736
about doing it

37:52.737 --> 37:54.037
-in the empty archive room.
-No. No!

37:54.039 --> 37:57.007
I put my ass out in my home,

37:57.009 --> 37:59.809
at the gym, at the doctor's,

37:59.811 --> 38:02.012
and at a certain yoga class
that I take

38:02.014 --> 38:05.415
that is very specific,
welcoming, and supportive.

38:06.285 --> 38:08.618
That's too many places, Connor!

38:08.620 --> 38:09.919

-[sighs]

38:09.921 --> 38:11.888
<i> ¶ You only call me ¶</i>

38:11.889 --> 38:13.856
If you would have acted like the
perfect couple for long enough,

38:13.859 --> 38:16.026
you would've become
the perfect couple.

38:16.028 --> 38:19.029
Yeah. But we wouldn't
have been happy.

38:19.031 --> 38:21.564
You would've been
the perfect couple.

38:21.566 --> 38:22.832
That is happy.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.801
Everyone pretends
in a relationship.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.636
Well, maybe they shouldn't.

38:26.638 --> 38:27.904
Are you joking?

38:27.906 --> 38:30.940
Being honest is so overrated.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.343
My parents have been married
over 30 years

38:33.345 --> 38:36.579
and my dad still thinks my mom
is a natural blonde.

38:36.581 --> 38:37.681
And she's Asian.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.617
That's so sad.

38:41.053 --> 38:43.953
Not that she's Asian.

38:43.955 --> 38:46.523
Relationships should
be based on truth.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.891
-Yeah.
-And trust.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.893
[sighs]
I give up.

38:50.362 --> 38:51.795
[gulps]

38:51.797 --> 38:53.997
I'm going to a baby shower.

[laughs]

38:58.570 --> 39:00.904
[upbeat music]

39:04.076 --> 39:05.975
I really can't believe it,
but it turns out

39:05.977 --> 39:08.111
that those wrestlers,
they're actors,

39:08.113 --> 39:10.013
and that they're not
actually fighting each other.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.548
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah, I'd been watching it

39:11.550 --> 39:12.782
-for years at that point.
-[Emma] Hey, Nick!

39:12.784 --> 39:14.851
-Yeah?
-[Emma] Hey, um...

39:14.853 --> 39:16.086
Hi.

39:17.389 --> 39:18.822
Hi. Um...

39:18.824 --> 39:20.457
Panda Bites
is your account, right?

39:20.459 --> 39:21.625
Till they get the boot.

39:21.626 --> 39:22.792
Right, well until then,
can I just have,

39:22.794 --> 39:24.461
like, a tiny little bit
of the marketing budget

39:24.463 --> 39:26.463
to put a two-for-one ad
in a magazine?

39:26.465 --> 39:27.697
Where?

39:28.633 --> 39:29.999
Um...
[smacks lips]

39:30.001 --> 39:31.101
...<i> Bowling Monthly.</i>

39:31.103 --> 39:33.103
-[Emma] I have a theory to test.
-[sighs]

39:33.105 --> 39:35.672
Look, I think that we've been
targeting the wrong demo.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.006
Like, I'm telling you,

39:37.008 --> 39:38.074
my grandpa and his friends,

39:38.076 --> 39:39.809
they're obsessed
with Panda Bites.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.010
[scoffs, snickers]
Somebody's obsessed

39:41.012 --> 39:42.445
with their grandpa.

39:42.447 --> 39:43.580
[snickers]

39:45.717 --> 39:46.983
I'm going.

39:49.454 --> 39:52.722
Nick, please.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.892
[inhales sharply]
I don't know.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.927
I won't tell anyone
what happened

39:57.929 --> 39:59.829
at Chuck's retirement party.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.064
[Nick gasps]

40:01.533 --> 40:03.400
Uh...

40:06.438 --> 40:07.537
[clicks tongue]

40:08.840 --> 40:10.707
Fine.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.709
Thank you. Thank you so much.

40:12.711 --> 40:13.977

Jack Harper's assistant called,

40:17.916 --> 40:20.650

the Leopold file to his office.

40:20.652 --> 40:21.718
[sighs]

40:26.658 --> 40:28.825
Uh, yeah, guys, I'm gonna say

40:28.827 --> 40:30.960
that you're way off base
on this one.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.829
[Paul] Jan, I'm gonna go
and hand this over to you.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.164
-[Jan] <i> Okay.</i>
-[Jack] Thank you.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.668
-Hey, uh, come in.
-Yeah.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.938
What does this look like to you?

40:41.940 --> 40:43.840
[inhales heavily]
[Emma] That.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.675
-Mm-hm.
-[smacks lips]

40:47.045 --> 40:51.848
Panda and a... cockroach?

40:51.850 --> 40:55.952
It's actually... ovaries
with some panda eyes.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.720
-[Jack] So, yeah.
-Okay.

40:57.722 --> 40:59.556
Would you buy this...

40:59.558 --> 41:01.891
if it was on a product
of some kind?

41:01.893 --> 41:05.161
Is it a product for my ovaries?

41:06.198 --> 41:07.664
No, it's not.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.032
[inhales deeply]

41:09.868 --> 41:11.885
No.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.903
No. That's the right answer.
That's the right answer, yeah.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.004
It's terrible.

41:15.006 --> 41:18.107
-Anyway. Hi.
-Hi.

41:18.109 --> 41:21.211
Um, I brought you the,
the Leopold file.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.581
You made an actual Leopold file.

41:24.583 --> 41:25.782
Yeah.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.484
Well, I didn't want...
if I dropped it,

41:27.486 --> 41:31.054
I didn't want anyone to see
that there was nothing in there.

41:31.056 --> 41:32.755
-[Emma] So...
-[chuckles]

41:32.757 --> 41:35.959
"From the office

Wow, that's,
that's quite the customer.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.399
That's right.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.633
"May I add that I am delighted

to starting my day

41:47.038 --> 41:48.738
with a bowl of Panda Pebbles.

Which is the best cereal
I've ever had."

Yep.

41:52.611 --> 41:53.977
Wow. This is...
[chuckles]

41:54.746 --> 41:56.012
This is amazing.

he would've loved this.

Um, do you wanna,
do you wanna sit down?

-I'm sorry. Are, are you okay?
-[Emma] Yeah.

42:28.713 --> 42:32.949
I'm fine. I think,
you know, it's for the best.

Right. Yeah, um...

42:42.294 --> 42:45.795
Yeah. Sure, okay.
Um, well, I guess...

42:45.797 --> 42:47.196
Maybe now is not the...

42:47.999 --> 42:50.633
best time to ask, um...

42:50.635 --> 42:51.701
What?

42:52.971 --> 42:56.773
Well, I was, I was,
I was wondering if you...

what does this look like?

Well, I thought we could
be spontaneous,

Uh, the key. I know it's small.

47:09.160 --> 47:13.095
Um, but, can... is Chad
to come in? Chad?

47:13.097 --> 47:15.198
-Is it?
-[clangs]

47:16.935 --> 47:19.101
Uh, are you sure
this is the right address?

47:19.103 --> 47:21.604
Hold on, I'm, it's... This is...

47:21.606 --> 47:23.172
Just... I'm just gonna ask.

47:24.876 --> 47:26.375
-[spits]
-Yeah.

47:26.377 --> 47:27.476

47:27.478 --> 47:29.111
[retches]
Hi.

47:29.113 --> 47:31.247
[retches, coughs]

47:31.249 --> 47:33.883
I was just, has this got a bar?

47:33.885 --> 47:36.118
This, do you know
if there's a bar nearby?

47:36.120 --> 47:37.286
You want a drink?

47:37.288 --> 47:39.222
-Lose deputy dipshit...
-You know what,

47:39.224 --> 47:42.091
-I think we're good.
-Thank you, no. I think...

47:42.093 --> 47:43.860
-I'm sorry. Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

47:43.862 --> 47:45.027
Maybe we'll come back.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.495
I could have sworn it was here.

47:46.497 --> 47:49.332
It's like this really cool club,
it's so cool.

47:49.334 --> 47:52.568
And like, tons of celebrities
go there, and it's just like...

47:52.570 --> 47:54.604
I thought this was where it was.

47:54.606 --> 47:57.206
[chuckles softly]
Um, okay.

47:57.208 --> 47:59.041
Well, do you want me
to call a car?

47:59.043 --> 48:02.111
No, no, no. Don't.
It's, I mean...

48:03.081 --> 48:05.014
-All right. Um...
-We'll find it.

48:05.350 --> 48:06.883
[sighs]
Somehow.

48:06.885 --> 48:08.618
[chuckles]
Are you hungry?

48:08.620 --> 48:10.219
-I'm starving.
-Yeah?

48:10.221 --> 48:12.121
-Yeah.
-Do you like falafel?

[light music]

48:15.560 --> 48:17.226
[Emma] Mmm.

48:17.228 --> 48:18.628
-[Jack] Oh.

48:18.630 --> 48:20.062

Are you kidding me?

48:22.967 --> 48:25.501
Here. I don't, I'm...
I wanna be helpful.

48:25.503 --> 48:28.037
[both chuckle]

48:28.039 --> 48:29.505
-Well, here, I, uh...
-I'm abandoning it.

48:29.507 --> 48:31.007
[Jack] I don't blame you.

48:32.377 --> 48:35.177
God, I haven't been here
in so long.

48:36.981 --> 48:39.382
Pete used to drag me out
this way a lot.

48:42.353 --> 48:44.420
I guess since he's passed,
I, um...

48:53.364 --> 48:54.430
But...

48:55.500 --> 48:57.099
It's nice to be here again.

48:59.370 --> 49:01.270
And for a night that...

49:02.173 --> 49:04.006
didn't go according to plan.

49:04.008 --> 49:06.442
-[chuckles]
-[Jack] It went sort of, wrong.

49:06.444 --> 49:08.577
Yeah.
[chuckles]

49:08.579 --> 49:09.679
[Jack] This is, uh...

49:09.681 --> 49:11.547
-So embarrassing.
-[Jack] No.

49:11.549 --> 49:13.115
No. It's, uh...

49:14.319 --> 49:15.418
No, it's perfect.

49:16.287 --> 49:17.386
Hm.

49:34.038 --> 49:35.404
[Emma] It's okay.

49:35.406 --> 49:37.640
-[cell phone ringing continues]
-Sorry.

49:43.348 --> 49:44.413
Hello.

49:45.416 --> 49:47.183
What do we do? Plan B?

49:49.654 --> 49:51.053
Back to Chicago?

49:53.024 --> 49:55.257
Yeah. Bye.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.065
Is everything all right?

50:05.703 --> 50:08.004
It's just complicated.

50:08.006 --> 50:09.405
[Emma] Well, maybe I can help.

50:09.407 --> 50:11.407
Like, I'm really, really good
at giving advice.

50:11.409 --> 50:13.776
Like, I'm way better at giving
advice than taking advice.

50:13.778 --> 50:15.177
[Jack chuckles]

50:18.116 --> 50:19.448
Yeah, I just, like...

50:20.251 --> 50:21.317
I can't.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.189
[sighs deeply]

50:29.060 --> 50:30.593
[Emma] I understand
if you have to leave.

50:30.595 --> 50:33.195
No. Like, I wanted to...

50:34.332 --> 50:37.033
I wanted to spend
an evening with you, and...

50:38.770 --> 50:40.236
and that's what I'm doing.

50:43.775 --> 50:46.308
[romantic music]

50:53.418 --> 50:55.051
[Emma gasps]

50:59.057 --> 51:00.589
You could have any woman.

51:02.593 --> 51:04.226
Yeah, but I want you.

51:05.530 --> 51:07.129
[both chuckle]

51:07.131 --> 51:09.331
-That was so douchey!
-[Emma] No!

51:09.333 --> 51:10.599
[Jack] What I meant to say...

51:10.601 --> 51:12.301
[chuckles]

51:12.303 --> 51:14.387
Is...

51:14.388 --> 51:16.472
Maybe you're not the only one
looking for an earthquake.

51:17.375 --> 51:19.442
[gasps]
How do you remember that?

51:19.444 --> 51:22.511
I mean, you remember everything
that I said on the plane.

51:22.513 --> 51:27.083
Like, why would someone like you
be interested in my...

51:27.085 --> 51:28.517
boring little life?

51:28.519 --> 51:32.321
Emma, you, you are anything
but boring.

51:34.392 --> 51:37.126
Ever since you started talking
on that plane...

51:39.464 --> 51:40.563
I was gripped.

51:41.866 --> 51:43.332
You were gripped?

51:44.302 --> 51:45.468
I was gripped.

52:16.534 --> 52:17.666
[both chuckle]

52:19.670 --> 52:21.470
[Emma] Okay.

52:21.472 --> 52:22.638
I don't...

52:22.640 --> 52:24.807
-I don't know any tricks.
-What?

52:24.809 --> 52:26.976
Like, I know you've had sex

52:26.977 --> 52:29.144
with millions of, of, like,
supermodels and, like...

52:29.147 --> 52:31.547

-Okay.

52:35.219 --> 52:37.887
[Jack] Yeah, I don't know
any tricks, either.

52:37.889 --> 52:40.489
-Okay.
-Maybe one.

52:40.491 --> 52:41.557
[both panting]

52:43.895 --> 52:46.295

of a trick.

52:46.297 --> 52:47.463

52:50.468 --> 52:53.802
You're, like,
the most successful person

52:53.804 --> 52:56.238
that I have ever met
in real life.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.174
And you're like so...

52:58.843 --> 53:03.546
hot and, and handsome,

53:03.548 --> 53:05.614
and charming.

53:07.785 --> 53:11.587
And you have rock-hard abs.

53:11.589 --> 53:12.888
Okay. Okay.

53:12.890 --> 53:15.391
-It's ridiculous.
-[laughs]

53:15.393 --> 53:17.493
-Like you were made in a lab.
-Mm-mm.

53:17.962 --> 53:19.562
[chuckling]
What?

53:22.767 --> 53:24.934
And I'm just entirely flawed.

53:27.872 --> 53:29.705
That's not true.

53:29.707 --> 53:34.210
And I am not flawless,
I promise you.

53:34.212 --> 53:36.378
-Yes, you are.
-I am not.

53:36.380 --> 53:39.648
Name one defect.

53:39.650 --> 53:41.951
One blemish. You have none.

53:41.953 --> 53:44.587
Okay. Well, um...

53:45.856 --> 53:48.991
-Actually, no, um...

-Okay.

Okay, fine. I'm, I'm gonna tell
you something but, it...

53:57.535 --> 54:00.536
You have to promise
you will not tell anybody.

54:01.405 --> 54:02.504
Okay.

54:03.341 --> 54:04.440
I...

54:05.710 --> 54:07.876
I have syndactyly.

54:11.782 --> 54:13.015
What?

54:14.819 --> 54:16.285
It's...

54:16.988 --> 54:19.655
-only sometimes contagious.
-What?

54:19.657 --> 54:21.590
I'm kidding.
It's a, it's a joke.

54:21.592 --> 54:22.942
-It's a--
-What is that?

54:22.943 --> 54:24.293
-It's just... it's a joke.
-What is that?

54:24.295 --> 54:25.961
It's... okay. Calm down.
Calm down.

54:25.963 --> 54:28.297
-I'm calm.
-Just, just...

54:28.299 --> 54:30.833
You can't just spring something
like that on me.

54:30.835 --> 54:32.668
Just, just...

54:32.670 --> 54:35.337
-Just look.
-What?

54:35.339 --> 54:37.773
-[Emma] What are we looking at?
-[Jack] My foot.

54:37.775 --> 54:39.608
-[Emma] Oh, thank god.
-[Jack chuckles]

54:39.610 --> 54:40.976
[Emma] That's skinflactly?

54:40.978 --> 54:43.479
[snickers]
No, it's syndactyly.

54:43.481 --> 54:46.515
It's, uh, it's, it's not
a webbed feet situation.

54:46.517 --> 54:48.951
It's like a two-headed toe.

54:48.953 --> 54:50.403
[Jack] Look at it, it's not...

54:50.404 --> 54:51.854
-it's just, it's one...
-[Emma] You have webbed feet!

54:51.856 --> 54:52.921
It's one toe.

54:52.923 --> 54:54.290
-Well, it's two toes...
-Jack Harper

54:54.292 --> 54:55.457
-has webbed feet!
-...but it's one toe.

54:55.459 --> 54:57.826
No, I don't! I have, oh, my god.
Have I--

54:57.828 --> 55:00.663

-You, shush.

55:00.665 --> 55:02.598
-Jack Harper is hideous.
-No.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.567
Jack Harper is a hideous beast.

-No, we weren't.
-[Emma] Sure.

Why, this is what dancers wear.

59:52.122 --> 59:55.357
I am in this group, um...
[clicks tongue]

59:55.359 --> 59:58.160
Just a bunch of lawyers,
uh, got together,

59:58.162 --> 01:00:01.997
-and we formed a dance group.
-Dancing lawyers?

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:05.000
Yeah. And one judge.

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:08.003
That's great.

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:09.771
I don't know why
you didn't tell me that.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:12.307
-'Cause you would laugh?
-[Emma] No.

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:13.642
[both chuckle]

01:00:15.312 --> 01:00:18.046
Well, I'm really relieved
I didn't see you having sex.

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:19.047
Yeah, me too.

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:21.216
But it's also really a shame...

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:24.019
'cause I thought
we were both having

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:26.788
sweaty, passionate,
marathon sex.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.357
What?

Twice last night...

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.761

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.096
And I'm in love with him.

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:37.065
-I love him.
-[Lissy] Wow. Whoa.

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:39.234
Has he told you anything
about himself?

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:41.870
No.

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:43.739
Why are you lawyering me?

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.375
-Stop.
-[Lissy] Okay.

01:00:46.377 --> 01:00:48.944
I'm just curious

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:50.746
whether he's sharing himself
with you.

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:54.249
Look, I know that he's like
a really private person,

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:56.752
but I think he's gonna start
opening up, because...

01:00:57.788 --> 01:00:59.321
I opened up first.

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:02.290
Men and women, they should
just be honest with each other

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:05.394
right from the start.
Like, all of this being aloof...

01:01:05.396 --> 01:01:09.031
and mysterious stuff.
It's total bullshit.

01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:11.066
Everyone should just tell
their secrets

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:12.334
to each other right away.

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:15.704
-Okay?
-Toots knows.

[Toots softly growling]

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:18.907

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.219

That's, that's actually
a really good idea.

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:08.123
I don't know any of his secrets.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:09.524
You don't know any of them?

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.259
Lissy was right.

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:14.262
Our relationship
was completely one-sided.

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:16.798
Like, he knew everything
about me,

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.733
and I knew nothing about him.

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:21.336
-Nothing at all?
-No.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:28.743
He, he has like...
he has skindylactfootly.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:29.811
What?

01:07:29.813 --> 01:07:32.580
Skindactfully.

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:34.516
[Emma] It's like webbed feet.

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:37.519
Like, two toes fused together.

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:39.287
Oh, yeah. I get it. I get it.

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:42.390
But it's, he still has his toes,
they're just like...

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.526
-Yeah, I, it's not right.
-It's like a hoof?

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:46.161
Yeah, kind of like a hoof.

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:47.729
-[Emma] Sorta.
-It's a, it's a deformity.

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:49.597
-You can't make fun of that.
-But it's fine,

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:51.800
-because you just wear socks
-Mm-hm.

01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:53.735
-Like a special sock?
-[Emma] No, no.

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:55.403
Okay, well, anything else?

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:58.506
Nothing?

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:01.443
What?

01:08:02.345 --> 01:08:03.711
He was in Chicago.

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:05.180
Chicago. Okay.

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:07.215
He didn't want me
to tell anyone.

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:09.249
And he was like very, very
adamant that I not tell anyone.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:11.519
And I overheard him say
something about, like, um,

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:13.088
a Plan B.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:16.491
Wait, that's, that's it?
Chicago?

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:19.227
Plan B?

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:20.295
Yeah.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:23.497
Okay.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.133
Not exactly a kill shot.

01:08:26.169 --> 01:08:26.868
[sighs]

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:29.104
[sobbing]

01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:32.372
[gloomy music]

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:36.344
[coworkers laughter echoing]

01:08:39.182 --> 01:08:40.415
[Casey] I'm so sorry.

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:42.517
Things are just so...

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:44.551
[background chatter]

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.421
[sighs]

01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:47.488
You okay?

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:54.662
I mean, if I had gone through

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:57.532
what you went through,
with everyone...

01:08:57.533 --> 01:09:00.902
seeing and knowing all that,
I would...

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:05.707
just wither away to my death.

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:09.676
I would literally figure out
a way to make a time machine,

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:11.546
so I could go back in time.

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:14.282
But like, not our time,
like, my ancestor's time,

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:19.220
so I could just wipe out
my whole lineage.

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:21.555
[blows air]
Done. You know?

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:24.658
Yeah. Yeah, I, I...

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.661
-I mean...
-[door closes]

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.462
-Ditto.
-[Jack] Emma.

01:09:29.866 --> 01:09:31.232
Oh, my god.

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:32.800
-[Jack] Uh, Emma?
-No. Don't look at him.

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.602
Don't look... Just look at me.
Just pretend

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:36.104
-that he's not here.
-Oh.

01:09:36.104 --> 01:09:37.604
-He's right there.
-[Emma] No. Look at me.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:39.407
Don't. Just pretend.

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.408
[Jack] Can we talk?

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.410
No. There is nothing
to talk about.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.380
[Jack] I just wanna try
to explain.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.549
-What? How you betrayed her?
-Casey.

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:48.850
Casey, just...

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.685
-[Emma] Casey.
-[sighs heavily]

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:53.921
-I'm sorry for yelling at you.
-[Emma] Hey, Casey.

01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:55.924
Mr. Harper, my boss.

01:09:55.926 --> 01:09:57.392
[clears throat]

01:09:58.595 --> 01:09:59.827
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:01.829
-No, no, no.
-[Emma] No. Get...

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:03.398
-Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
-Just...

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.466
Look, hey. You got this.

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:10.371
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

01:10:11.441 --> 01:10:12.540
Sir.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:17.412
[snickers]

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:18.546
[door opens]

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:21.449
-[door closes]
-[Emma sighs]

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:23.551
[Jack] Emma.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:24.819
Emma.

01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:27.422
I am so sorry.

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:29.691
[Emma]
Everyone was laughing at me.

01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:31.559
You, you humiliated me.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:34.262
I know, I know. They, they,
they asked me that question,

01:10:34.264 --> 01:10:35.964
they caught me off guard
and I, and I, I panicked.

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:37.832
[Emma] You broke your promise.

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:40.668
You told me that you would die
with my secrets.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.337
I fucked up.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:45.940
I am so sorry.

01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:48.943
[Emma] Do you have any idea
how violated I felt?

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:54.449
Is it, is it really that bad

01:10:54.451 --> 01:10:56.384
for people to know
the truth about you?

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:01.256
[scoffs]
Are you kidding me?

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.628
You haven't told me
anything about you.

01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:12.300
You think that your secrets
are more important than mine.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:13.768
No. That's not true.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.437
Then why don't you tell me
what you were doing in Chicago?

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.389
Why don't you tell me

01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:20.340
what you were answering
all those phone calls for?

01:11:20.577 --> 01:11:22.010
[sighs]

01:11:22.012 --> 01:11:25.713
Look, it's really hard for me
to trust people.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.682
Okay? I've been burned a lot.

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:29.350
Look, I get that.

01:11:31.388 --> 01:11:35.823
But I can't be the only one
who's being vulnerable in this.

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.492
[Emma sniffles]

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:41.963
[sighs]
Goodbye, Jack.

01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:44.432
[Emma sobbing]

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:47.969
[door opens, closes]

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:49.804
[Emma] <i> I saw Jack.</i>

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:52.573
Oh, tell me
you didn't go to him.

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:54.876
No. He came to me to apologize.

01:11:54.878 --> 01:11:56.577
What did he say?

01:11:56.579 --> 01:11:59.647
He said that he fucked up,

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.717
that he thinks his secrets
are more important than mine.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:04.719
-Oh, hell no!
-[Gemma scoffs]

01:12:04.721 --> 01:12:07.322
Okay, well,
if they're so important,

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:09.090
then you gotta find out
what they are and expose them.

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:10.625
I don't know what he's hiding.

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:12.026
Maybe he's with another woman.

01:12:12.696 --> 01:12:13.795
What?

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:15.697
[Emma] Really?

01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:17.432
Do you think
he's with another woman?

01:12:17.434 --> 01:12:21.369
No, no. I don't...
I don't know. I don't know.

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:22.670
No.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.072
What else would he be hiding?

01:12:24.074 --> 01:12:26.574
It doesn't matter
whether he is, or he's not.

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:29.043
No. It does matter.
And you need to get revenge.

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:31.913
[Gemma] He needs to pay.

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:33.815
I know a guy.
[exhales sharply]

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:35.917
What? Are you gonna
have him whacked?

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:37.985
[Gemma] No.
He's a tabloid reporter

01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:39.721
I hooked up with on Tinder.

01:12:39.723 --> 01:12:40.955
I'll take care of it, you know.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:43.041
[whispering]
She's crazy.

01:12:43.042 --> 01:12:45.126
I can't just tree-stand here
and watch you suffer.

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:47.862
I don't want revenge.
I just want closure.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:49.931
That's just another fancy word
for revenge.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:52.567
No, it's a different
word entirely.

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:54.435
[sighs]

01:12:54.437 --> 01:12:56.504
[cell phone ringing]

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:57.822
[indistinct chatter]

01:12:57.823 --> 01:12:59.139
[Cybill] You need to have
that ready for launch

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:00.108
and do three copies.

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:01.976
Good.

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:03.611
[Artemis] Well, look who's here.

01:13:05.849 --> 01:13:08.616
-[Cybill] Nick.
-[Nick] Yeah, boss?

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:13.588
Can you explain to me why,
for the love of god,

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:16.891
you would put a coupon ad
for Panda Bites...

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:19.927
in <i> Bowling Monthly Magazine?</i>

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.530
[Nick clicks tongue, sighs]

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:23.965
It was actually, uh...

01:13:23.967 --> 01:13:27.001
Well, I have the numbers.

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:30.138
And despite
the shit-show circulation,

01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:32.573
they're off the charts.

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:33.674
[Nick] Oh.

01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:35.743
Well, that's great.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.228
Good job.

01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:38.712
-It was a bit of a gamble.
-[Cybill] Okay.

01:13:39.182 --> 01:13:41.316
But, um...

01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:43.451
I thought it was time
to experiment with the new...

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.821
-Demographic.
-Smart.

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:48.556
Excellent. Well, it paid off.

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:50.158
Wait, wait, wait. Sorry.

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.662
No, I'm not sorry.
That was my idea.

01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:56.664
That was entirely my idea, Nick.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:59.667
Well, uh, we may have...

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:02.136
discussed it, but you, you know,

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:03.971
marketing is all about teamwork.

01:14:03.973 --> 01:14:05.973
-We're sitting here as a team.
-It's not.

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:07.442
It wasn't teamwork.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:09.110
[Emma] You were gonna axe
Panda Bites.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:12.146
I told you I knew we were just
marketing to the wrong demo.

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:14.115
Because everything
is marketed to millennials.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:15.983
You make something cool
for the older crowd,

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:17.819
they're gonna show up for it.

01:14:17.821 --> 01:14:19.187
Not bad, Corrigan.

01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:20.922
Thank you.

01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:22.657
-Nick.
-[Nick] Yeah.

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:26.594
[Cybill] Don't you ever pass off
someone else's idea

01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:28.463
as your own again.

01:14:28.832 --> 01:14:30.565
All right.

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:33.201
-Anything else?
-So can I have my promotion?

01:14:33.203 --> 01:14:34.502
[Artemis] What?

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:37.872
You told me
that I could have a promotion

01:14:37.874 --> 01:14:38.940
if I made my own opportunities,

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:40.708
and I think
that I did that here.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.577
And I have put everything
into this job.

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:44.045
And I think
that I've proven myself now,

01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:45.980
and I think that I deserve
a promotion.

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:51.018
Fair enough.

01:14:51.888 --> 01:14:54.755
All righty. Meeting done.

01:14:54.757 --> 01:14:56.057
Well, I guess
that's what happens

01:14:56.059 --> 01:14:57.658
when you sleep with the boss.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:02.063
Corrigan. We need to talk.

01:15:04.767 --> 01:15:06.033
Okay.

01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:09.320
Hi.

01:15:09.321 --> 01:15:11.137
I know Jack Harper
to be a decent man.

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:14.041
[Cybill] I have one thing
to ask you, Corrigan.

01:15:14.043 --> 01:15:16.177
-Was it your choice?
-[Emma] Yes.

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:19.113
When I met him, I didn't
even know he worked here.

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:20.715
Okay.

01:15:20.717 --> 01:15:24.185
[inhales sharply]
I think it's important that...

01:15:24.187 --> 01:15:26.153
that you know that as a woman,

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:28.623
you have to work twice as hard
as everyone else

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:30.091
to be taken seriously.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:32.760
And this is gonna make it
that much harder,

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:33.961
because everyone's
going to assume

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:35.196
that everything you get

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:37.598
is because you slept
with the boss.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.100
But you earned it.

01:15:39.102 --> 01:15:40.735
-[Cybill] Okay?
-Yes.

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:46.073
[sighs]

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:47.675
Don't tell anyone I did that.

01:15:47.677 --> 01:15:49.243
[chuckles]
Okay.

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:54.982
[sighs]

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:56.883
-[Emma] <i> I got the promotion.</i>
-[Casey] <i> See?</i>

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.286
That's great news.

01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.254
[whirring]

01:16:02.025 --> 01:16:03.291
[Connor sighs]

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:08.963
[elevator dings]

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:11.566
[clears throat]

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:14.201
[Connor] So, Emma...

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:18.205
I need to ask you a question.

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:21.776
-Sure.
-It's a sex question.

01:16:21.778 --> 01:16:23.744
Oh.

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:26.614
[Connor] Were you always honest
with me in that department?

01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:28.149
Oh, kill me now, God.

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:29.817
[Emma] Connor, I'm, I'm...

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:31.319
Please, I wanna learn
from my mistakes.

01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:32.987
Oh, my god.

01:16:33.823 --> 01:16:36.157
[sighs]
Okay, um...

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:38.359
There was that one, like...

01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:40.962
that one thing that you did
with your tongue,

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:42.897
like the slidy thing.

01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:44.699
The slide down or the slide in?

01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:47.335
The slide, it's both.

01:16:47.337 --> 01:16:50.638
[Emma] It's a little bit
not in the right... spot.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.340
[Connor] You show me
what it should look like.

01:16:52.342 --> 01:16:54.775
What I would imagine, I think,

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:56.711
-you find the right spot.
-Right.

01:16:56.713 --> 01:16:57.812
And then...

01:16:57.814 --> 01:16:59.464
Okay.

01:16:59.465 --> 01:17:01.115
-[Emma] You can also, like that.
-[Connor] Oh, with the fingers?

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:04.218
And then, yeah, yeah.
You find the clitoris.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.853
Yeah, but not...

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:07.188
-Oh, not the side to side?
-Not that.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.756
-Oh, I thought it was fun.
-It's bizarre

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:10.903
and then you miss the spot.

01:17:10.904 --> 01:17:13.049
-[Casey] Are we stuck?
-[elevator dings]

01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:15.195
Well, Emma, I fully believe
that you deserve happiness,

01:17:15.198 --> 01:17:19.734
and I hope that Jack is
as generous a lover as I was.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.071
[Connor scoffs]

01:17:26.242 --> 01:17:29.076
[light music]

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:38.686
[Omar] Yeah, you know
the clause four sets.

01:17:39.188 --> 01:17:41.255
Yeah. I wrote clause four.

01:17:44.894 --> 01:17:46.727
[grunting]

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:50.031
[Omar] Dude, dude,
that's clause eight.

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:51.065
[Emma] Lissy!

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:52.700
[Omar] Come on, man...

01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:55.436
My god. You look amazing.

01:17:55.438 --> 01:17:57.371
So beautiful!

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.439
Thanks.

01:17:58.441 --> 01:18:00.207
Where's your outfit?

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:01.308
It's backstage.

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:03.310
[sighs]

01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:04.779
I can't do this.

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:06.047
-What?
-[Lissy] I can't do this.

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:07.682
I don't wanna do this.
I don't...

01:18:07.684 --> 01:18:09.300
I'm, I'm way too nervous.

01:18:09.301 --> 01:18:10.917
-No, everyone feels that way.
-[Lissy] I don't wanna do this.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.787
I feel bad.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up

01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:14.055
and shit, and like...

01:18:14.057 --> 01:18:16.057
It's totally normal.

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.058
[Emma] Here, look.
Look at the dancing judge.

01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:20.327
Look, if he can do it,
then you can do it.

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:22.763
-He's really good.
-[Emma] Yeah. He is.

01:18:22.765 --> 01:18:24.398
And so are you.

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:26.032
You can do this.
Trust me, you can do this.

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:29.003
-[Lissy] Okay.
-Okay?

01:18:29.005 --> 01:18:31.105
[Lissy groans]

01:18:31.107 --> 01:18:32.873
-[Lissy] I love you.
-I love you.

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.208
[pants]

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:38.979
[Jack] Emma.

01:18:43.319 --> 01:18:44.485
What are you doing here?

01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:47.354
[Jack] I, um...

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:49.457
I saw the flyer you put up
at the office.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.728
Look, I came here to tell you
that you were right.

01:18:55.198 --> 01:18:57.998
I should have shared
a lot more with you.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.368
[Jack] I was in Chicago...

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:03.771
because I was visiting someone.

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:07.174
-A girl.
-A woman.

01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:09.276
[Jack] No.

01:19:09.278 --> 01:19:11.212
No. It's...

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:12.480
It's actually...

01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:15.015
Um, a little girl.

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:19.787
Her name's Alice. She's, um.

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:21.155
She's four years old.

01:19:22.058 --> 01:19:23.290
You have a daughter?

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:25.493
No. Um...

01:19:25.495 --> 01:19:27.394
She's my goddaughter.

01:19:28.197 --> 01:19:30.331
She was Pete's.

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:32.533
[Jack] Um...

01:19:39.142 --> 01:19:41.342
[Emma chuckles softly]
She's cute.

01:19:43.379 --> 01:19:44.362
[Jack] Yeah.

01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:45.346
I didn't know
that he had a daughter.

01:19:46.883 --> 01:19:50.151
Yeah, um, nobody really does.

01:19:50.153 --> 01:19:52.319
We're trying to keep her
out of the spotlight.

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:56.023
There was a tabloid
snooping around,

01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:57.458
and I had to kill the story.

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:01.028
That's your big secret?

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:03.063
[Jack] It doesn't seem
like much, but...

01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:05.533
[sighs]
This kid...

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:09.303
she means the world to me.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:11.505
And, and I just want her
to have a normal life.

01:20:15.111 --> 01:20:17.344
I'm sorry
that I didn't tell you.

01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:19.246
[Emma] You don't have
to be sorry.

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:22.416
Look, only a handful of people
know about her.

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:24.585
A very special...

01:20:25.555 --> 01:20:28.155
trusted handful.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:33.828
[usher] <i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i> the house is now open.</i>

01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:35.596
-I should probably...
-Yeah.

01:20:35.598 --> 01:20:37.298
sit down.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.666
Well, thanks.

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.033
Thanks for keeping this
to yourself. I...

01:20:40.036 --> 01:20:42.102
I know that you knew how
important it was to me, so...

01:20:42.104 --> 01:20:44.205
Yeah, of course. No. It's okay.

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:45.272
[chuckles]

01:20:50.947 --> 01:20:52.146
Hey!

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:57.251
Do you wanna maybe...

01:20:57.253 --> 01:21:00.487
watch a bunch of lawyers
find their inner artists?

01:21:00.489 --> 01:21:02.489
[chuckles]

01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:03.958
-Yeah.
-[Emma] Yeah?

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.426
Yeah. Sounds good.

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:10.464
[orchestral music]

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.243
Oh, my god, that's Lissy.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:34.188
She's remarkable.

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:35.623
[chuckles]

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:03.550
[Emma] Lissy.

01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:06.654
My god, you were so amazing!

01:22:06.656 --> 01:22:09.390
I had no idea you could dance.

01:22:10.393 --> 01:22:12.009
Yeah. Hi.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.626
-Hi, you were so good.
-[Lissy] Um, thanks.

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:15.229
Thank you for coming.

01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:17.464
I mean, I totally messed up,
I was definitely--

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:19.266
Stop. I wanna hear you say,

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:21.435
"I was magical",
because you were magical.

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:22.503
[sighs deeply]

01:22:24.173 --> 01:22:28.075
Okay. I was, I was magical.
[chuckles]

01:22:28.077 --> 01:22:30.077
-That's right.
-[Lissy exhales]

01:22:30.079 --> 01:22:33.247
-Thank you for being here.
-[Emma] Of course.

01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:34.715
-Oh.
-I wanna take your picture.

01:22:34.717 --> 01:22:36.317
-You look beautiful.
-[groans]

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:38.052
[chuckles]

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:39.954
-Shit, I left my bag.
-[Jack] Oh. Your bag.

01:22:39.956 --> 01:22:41.555
-I'll, I'll get it.
-[Emma] Okay. Are you sure?

01:22:41.557 --> 01:22:42.723
-Yeah.
-[Emma] Okay. Thank you.

01:22:42.725 --> 01:22:44.158
[Lissy] Thanks.

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:46.026
What?

01:22:46.028 --> 01:22:47.461
He came to talk to me.

01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:50.064
-[Lissy] Okay.
-He came to tell me his secret.

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:54.435
-Okay. what is it?
-I can't tell you.

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:56.103
-[Lissy] Emma.
-I'm sorry, I can't.

01:22:56.105 --> 01:22:57.538
-After all that?
-I can't.

01:22:58.374 --> 01:22:59.640
[Gemma] Emma!

01:22:59.642 --> 01:23:02.376
<i>This is Mick fromThe Enquirer.</i>

01:23:03.346 --> 01:23:05.045
If you could just state
your name.

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:06.347
Okay, can you please leave?

01:23:06.349 --> 01:23:08.115
There's been like,
a huge misunderstanding.

01:23:08.117 --> 01:23:09.550
-[Gemma] What?
-[Mick] Is she Emma Corrigan?

01:23:09.552 --> 01:23:10.985
Yes. She is Emma Corrigan,

01:23:10.987 --> 01:23:13.153
and she needs to get back
at Jack Harper.

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:14.555
-You have to, you have to...
-[Mick] Hi.

01:23:14.557 --> 01:23:16.090
-You have to leave right now.
-[Mick] Wait, wait.

01:23:16.092 --> 01:23:17.358
-Don't talk yet.
-[Emma] No, stop.

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:18.625
Let me hit record.
Just tell me everything

01:23:18.627 --> 01:23:20.327
-you know about Jack Harper.
-[Emma] Please, just go.

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:22.029
[Lissy] She doesn't have
to tell you anything.

01:23:22.031 --> 01:23:23.630
America wants to hear
this story.

01:23:23.632 --> 01:23:25.316
Can you go, please?

01:23:25.317 --> 01:23:27.001
You know, there's a lot of money
to be made in this.

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:28.669
There's no money to be made,
there's no story.

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:30.671
Jack Harper needs
to learn his lesson.

01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:32.373
Lissy, please,
can you do something?

01:23:32.375 --> 01:23:34.508
-Guys, just go.
-[Lissy] I'm a lawyer.

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:37.511
-[Gemma] No, no, no.
-[Emma] Go. Just stop.

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:38.612
[Jack] Oh.

01:23:38.614 --> 01:23:40.481
[Mick] Mr. Harper,
can you confirm

01:23:40.483 --> 01:23:44.018
that you were on a flight
from Chicago

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.519
with Miss Corrigan?

01:23:46.455 --> 01:23:48.105
What's going on?

01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:49.756
-[Mick] Just wanna get a photo.
-She's getting her revenge.

01:23:49.759 --> 01:23:52.226
-That is what's going on.
-[Emma] Stop. No. Jack!

01:23:52.762 --> 01:23:54.395
-[Mick] Jack, one more question.
-Stop it!

01:23:54.397 --> 01:23:56.397
[Emma] Jack, wait. Wait!

01:23:56.399 --> 01:23:58.065
So that's why you pressed me
on Chicago?

01:23:58.067 --> 01:23:59.433
No. They don't know anything.

01:23:59.435 --> 01:24:00.768
-You have to believe me.
-Except the one thing

-No, Jack.
-You wonder why

01:24:03.722 --> 01:24:05.239
-I don't trust people.
-I was hurt and I was angry.

01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:07.708

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:08.809
[Emma] I didn't.

01:24:08.811 --> 01:24:11.211

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:13.347

-[Emma] Hi.

01:25:43.672 --> 01:25:46.240
Cybill told me you were leaving.

01:25:46.242 --> 01:25:49.209
I need to tell you something
before they send me to my seat.

01:25:53.549 --> 01:25:55.349
I didn't tell that guy anything.

01:25:56.285 --> 01:25:59.153
I would never ever,
ever do that.

01:26:02.458 --> 01:26:04.191
In my whole life,

01:26:05.294 --> 01:26:06.460
I always based

01:26:07.530 --> 01:26:10.197
my value in myself...

01:26:10.199 --> 01:26:12.332
off of what other people
thought of me.

01:26:14.436 --> 01:26:17.304
I completely lost sight
of who I was.

01:26:18.407 --> 01:26:19.606
And then I met you.

01:26:21.277 --> 01:26:24.478
And I told you everything
about me.

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:27.881
I told you all of my secrets.

01:26:30.953 --> 01:26:34.354
And, you didn't leave.

01:26:35.791 --> 01:26:39.293
Even though you knew
all of my goofiness,

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:42.796

And I didn't know anything
about you.

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:58.545
But it didn't matter,
because I knew your heart.

01:27:00.883 --> 01:27:04.218
You made me believe
that I could be loved

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:06.453
just by being myself.

01:27:06.455 --> 01:27:09.023
You made me believe

01:27:09.024 --> 01:27:11.592
that the only way to be loved
was by being myself.

01:27:13.862 --> 01:27:15.762
-And that is amazing.

I have a fake tooth.

01:28:16.475 --> 01:28:18.292
I cracked mine trying
to open a beer bottle

01:28:18.294 --> 01:28:19.760
to impress a girl in college.

-[Jack sighs]
-[baby cooing]

in her uncle's barn.

01:28:25.768 --> 01:28:28.969
And like a true, true loser,

01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:32.939
I asked if I could keep her bra
as a souvenir.

Nice!

I have always wished
that I was two inches taller.

Usually, when I sit
in board meetings,

01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:10.544
I look around and I think...

"Who the hell are these people?"
