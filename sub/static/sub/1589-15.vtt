WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:04.388
Previously...

00:04.430 --> 00:06.330
I came to pay my respects.

00:06.370 --> 00:08.292
Then where is my daughter?

00:08.340 --> 00:10.365
We found a letter from Bethany
explaining the matching clothes,

00:10.410 --> 00:11.604
explaining everything

00:11.640 --> 00:14.336
and Holbrook is doing whatever
he can to get it thrown out.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.404
SPENCER:
We should've told Tanner

00:15.440 --> 00:16.771
about him and Ali
months ago.

00:16.810 --> 00:19.119
Once it's all done,
this will all be bookshelves.

00:19.150 --> 00:20.310
Oh, looks good.

00:20.350 --> 00:21.510
Please don't go.

00:21.550 --> 00:22.539
I have to.

00:24.390 --> 00:26.085
I applied to six colleges.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.348
You want me to _find out
why you got rejected.

00:27.390 --> 00:31.087
I need to know
if it's me or if it's "A."

00:31.130 --> 00:32.119
( cell phone ringing )

00:32.160 --> 00:33.388
Ali!

00:34.430 --> 00:35.328
"A" set me up.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.464
Alison DiLaurentis,
you're under arrest

00:37.500 --> 00:39.434
for the murder
of Mona Vanderwaal.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.773
Morning.

00:55.820 --> 00:57.117
I was told--

00:57.150 --> 00:58.447
Where you from?

00:58.490 --> 01:01.687
Rosewood P.D.,
Lieutenant Tanner--

01:01.720 --> 01:03.358
Yeah, I know her.

01:11.370 --> 01:12.439
You waiting for something?

01:13.640 --> 01:14.789
We're clone.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.660
Thank you.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.748
They need to see me.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.351
They're not taking my calls.

01:32.390 --> 01:34.608
They can't keep ignoring me.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.850
Why did they move you here?

01:38.890 --> 01:42.189
I don't have to explain
that to you.

01:42.230 --> 01:43.868
You've been in these places.

01:43.900 --> 01:47.495
Everything but a bell goes off
when they smell fresh meat.

01:53.910 --> 01:56.140
Tell Spencer
to cut this embargo crap

01:56.180 --> 01:57.306
before it's too late.

01:57.350 --> 02:01.446
Have you forgotten
what it feels like

02:01.480 --> 02:05.416
to be in a cage
for something
you didn't do?

02:05.450 --> 02:07.350
Do you remember
how that felt?

02:07.390 --> 02:10.518
Yes, I do.

02:10.560 --> 02:14.451
But I also remember
whose words put me In that cage.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.751
Do you?

02:17.330 --> 02:19.230
Maybe you'll finally get it
when your girlfriend

02:19.270 --> 02:21.261
and the others
are chained to this bench, too,

02:21.300 --> 02:22.858
because they will be.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.901
They're next.

02:26.210 --> 02:29.304
Unless "A" kills them first.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.772
* Got a secret

02:30.810 --> 02:31.947
* Can you keep it?

02:31.980 --> 02:34.540
* Swear this one you'll save

02:34.580 --> 02:36.741
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:36.790 --> 02:39.418
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:39.460 --> 02:41.587
* IfI show you then I know

02:41.620 --> 02:44.418
* You won't tell what I said

02:44.460 --> 02:46.849
* 'Cause two can keep
a secret *

02:46.900 --> 02:50.722
* If one of them is dead

02:50.770 --> 02:52.692
This is unbelievable.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.935
I mean, Ali's in the penalty box
and she's still playing offense.

02:54.970 --> 02:56.858
Or maybe this is
just her being iced out,

02:56.910 --> 02:58.207
getting desperate.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.639
But if you actually think

02:59.680 --> 03:01.534
there's somebody
on the outside helping her--

03:01.580 --> 03:04.378
Yeah, totally.
I mean, there was
a fireworks display.

03:04.410 --> 03:06.378
Maybe she planned
that before she got arrested.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.217
No way.
Someone is helping her.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.547
What do you mean, someone?

03:09.590 --> 03:11.387
I saw Alison and Holbrook
under the mistletoe,

03:11.420 --> 03:12.512
and he had his tongue
down her throat.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.515
It's him.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.913
We don't know that for sure.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.359
Didn't Tanner say
he was assigned

03:17.560 --> 03:18.822
He's off it.

03:18.860 --> 03:21.328
He had to take a personal leave
to take care of his sick dad.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.419
That's convenient.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.461
Can you see if Holbrook's
visiting Ali in prison?

03:25.500 --> 03:26.865
Uh, no, guys, he can't.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.595
Why should he be the one

03:28.640 --> 03:29.732
who's thrown head-first
into the lion's den?

03:29.770 --> 03:32.500
WOMAN: ( on radio)
All units 10-19.

03:32.540 --> 03:33.529
All units 10-19.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.569
I have to go.

03:34.610 --> 03:37.477
( school bell rings )

03:37.510 --> 03:40.479
Spencer, none of us
want to put Toby in danger.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.579
Well, maybe this weekend,
we can come up with a plan.

03:42.620 --> 03:43.609
I'm not even here
this weekend.

03:43.650 --> 03:44.617
Where are you?

03:44.650 --> 03:46.550
College visit.
Ballard.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.455
Ballard?
I thought it was Skidmore.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.481
How many schools
did you get into?

03:51.730 --> 03:53.652
So what are we gonna do
about Holbrook?

03:53.700 --> 03:55.691
This smells like Wilden
all over again.

03:55.730 --> 03:56.697
Holbrook is not Wilden.

03:56.730 --> 03:57.924
He may be worse.

03:57.970 --> 03:59.335
Holbrook's not that bad
of a cop.

03:59.370 --> 04:00.462
He's just
a really bad kisser.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.535
You kissed him?
When did you kiss him?

04:01.570 --> 04:02.639
What?

04:02.670 --> 04:03.807
Hanna?

04:05.340 --> 04:06.978
You guys, it was one kiss.
Closed mouth.

04:07.010 --> 04:08.534
Why did you kiss him?

04:08.580 --> 04:10.946
He helped my mom
with the whole
Wilden deposit box thing

04:10.980 --> 04:13.369
and he stood up
for Travis' dad in court.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.547
Okay, whatever happened
to a thank-you card?

04:15.580 --> 04:16.717
Look, if Holbrook's
helping Alison,

04:16.750 --> 04:18.980
then she probably convinced him
that she's the victim.

04:19.020 --> 04:20.487
If he knew
who she really was then--

04:20.520 --> 04:22.488
( school bell rings )

04:22.530 --> 04:24.486
Seriously though, how many
schools did you get into?

04:24.530 --> 04:26.521
I've got to go.

04:31.700 --> 04:32.997
( cell phone beeps )

04:37.640 --> 04:39.505
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

04:39.540 --> 04:42.703
Sure, just let me
finish this.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.548
Ezra's bugging out.
The opening went
from ten bookworms

04:45.580 --> 04:47.468
and a jug of Chablis
to an event.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.748
Caterer, publicist,

04:48.780 --> 04:51.578
he's basically had
to hire everything
but a belly dancer.

04:51.620 --> 04:52.587
Damn.

04:52.620 --> 04:53.917
Wow, you into belly dancers?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.609
I was going to ask him
for a raise.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.549
I need the _cash.
Forget It.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.921
Wait.
Cash for what?

04:59.960 --> 05:02.622
A plane ticket to go
and see Paige over spring break.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.059
My mom won't even let me
touch my college savings.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.796
Meanwhile, every day
that goes by, Paige and I,

05:07.840 --> 05:09.831
we're growing further apart.

05:09.870 --> 05:12.430
Last time we spoke,
I even mentioned

05:12.480 --> 05:13.777
looking into a liberal
arts school in Oregon--

05:13.810 --> 05:15.903
Em, can we not do this now?

05:17.450 --> 05:18.906
I can't talk about this.

05:18.950 --> 05:19.939
Paige and me?

05:19.980 --> 05:21.470
College.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.681
The whole subject
is making my hair fall out.

05:23.720 --> 05:24.846
Seriously, it's like
coming out in clumps.

05:24.890 --> 05:26.357
What are you talking about?

05:26.390 --> 05:28.654
Em, I've been rejected

05:28.690 --> 05:30.681
from every single college
I applied to.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.652
Yesterday,
Talmadge wait-listed me.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.849
Talmadge.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.721
Tell me that
"A" isn't responsible for this.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.419
A wait-list_ _
doesn't mean rejection.

05:38.470 --> 05:39.596
Yeah, well, the rest of you

05:39.640 --> 05:41.631
are gonna be waltzing off
to sorority rush

05:41.670 --> 05:44.366
and I'm gonna be stuck
picking up trash in Rosewood.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.832
Yeah, that'll be me,
dodging "A" messages

05:45.870 --> 05:47.929
and wearing a big floppy hat
to cover my bald spot.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.699
Aria, you can turn
a wait-list into an acceptance.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.514
My cousin wrote
an amazing letter to Yale

05:53.550 --> 05:54.471
and totally won them over.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.717
No, this is Alison's revenge,
keeping me here.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.718
( school bell rings )

05:59.760 --> 06:00.749
MAN: Are you in this class?

06:06.190 --> 06:09.694
So I opened everything
that looks work-related

06:09.730 --> 06:12.563
and I just figured
eventually I would forward

06:12.600 --> 06:13.828
your mother's mail to you.

06:13.870 --> 06:15.792
Thanks.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.034
So how's Hanna?

06:17.070 --> 06:20.437
She's focusing
on the future.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.902
She's actually
leaving later today

06:21.940 --> 06:24.101
for a weekend away
at Ballard College.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.038
It's a big decision.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.719
Looks like
you've made one, too.

06:28.750 --> 06:31.583
I'm guessing since you're
faxing out your resum.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.914
Yeah.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.781
I saw something that looked
potentially interesting

06:37.830 --> 06:38.922
and I thought I should--

06:38.960 --> 06:41.690
You leave and I'm stuck
working With some stranger,

06:41.730 --> 06:44.767
someone who'll ask a lot_ of
questions about my family.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.961
I have _a few
about your Sister myself.

06:48.670 --> 06:50.638
Honestly, Jason,
maybe you would be better off

06:50.670 --> 06:53.070
just starting fresh
with someone new here.

06:53.110 --> 06:55.533
I don't agree.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.798
Is there anything I can say

06:57.850 --> 07:00.648
to get you to stay
for one month?

07:00.680 --> 07:01.715
Just till I feel
confident enough

07:01.750 --> 07:07.711
to say that I belong here
and really believe it.

07:09.730 --> 07:10.719
Hi.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.557
Hey.
Can't talk right now.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.625
Why? What's going on?

07:14.660 --> 07:16.662
Tanner issued another search
behind Mona's house.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.191
Tanner still thinks...

07:19.230 --> 07:21.164
that Mona's body
is out there?

07:21.200 --> 07:22.804
( whispering )
I really got to go.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.765
OFFICER: Cavanaugh?

07:59.810 --> 08:01.038
All clear.

08:09.850 --> 08:10.942
What do you mean
it's your knife?

08:10.990 --> 08:13.550
I recognized it
as soon as I saw it.
It's my family's.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.114
My dad popped
the top off a jar with it

08:15.160 --> 08:16.855
when I was eight
and broke the handle.

08:16.890 --> 08:19.279
There's a chunk missing
right in the center.
Yeah.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.820
How do you know
what this knife looks like?

08:20.860 --> 08:22.999
Because I've used it.
Many times.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.861
It's from
my family's cabin.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.731
When I saw it, I froze.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.192
A million things
went through my head.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.832
And for a moment
I forgot I was a cop,

08:29.870 --> 08:30.632
so I didn't know what to do.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.137
I just left it there.
Oh, my God.

08:32.170 --> 08:33.205
I know I have to go back.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.174
Of course, you do.
You have to go back and get it.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.007
We have to get rid of it
before anybody else finds it.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.938
Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.642
That knife could be
the murder weapon.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.817
It's what we've been
looking for.

08:42.850 --> 08:43.839
It's what we need.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.846
We?
The police.

08:45.890 --> 08:48.051
Toby, Alison said it herself,

08:48.090 --> 08:50.854
she wants us with her,
behind bars.

08:50.890 --> 08:52.926
She's already framed me once.
The knife is a plant.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.029
You don't know that.

08:54.060 --> 08:55.823
I want to turn it in.

08:55.860 --> 08:58.693
If Alison stole that knife
and used it,

08:58.730 --> 09:00.197
that could lock her away
for good.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.231
_ _ All we need _
is just one of her prints.

09:02.270 --> 09:03.931
Right, but what
if it has mine on it?

09:03.970 --> 09:05.301
Or Hanna's?
Or yours?

09:05.340 --> 09:06.568
Yeah, that's a gamble,
but--

09:06.610 --> 09:08.009
But what?

09:08.040 --> 09:10.201
I'm not risking my neck
so you can get a medal for this.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.877
This is about doing
the right thing.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.616
There is no right thing.

09:13.650 --> 09:16.210
There's only by-the-book
or save-our-ass.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.888
And I know
which one I'm doing.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.218
Don't, man.
Spencer?

09:22.830 --> 09:24.081
This is crazy.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.950
I know you feel
the same way I do.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.022
I think that
we shouldn't do anything.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.634
We will promise
not to touch it,

09:34.670 --> 09:36.865
if you promise
to keep quiet.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.866
You just want
to leave it there?

09:38.910 --> 09:40.002
Fine.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.974
Then that's what we'll do.

09:42.010 --> 09:44.945
But no one can know
that we had this conversation.

09:44.980 --> 09:45.969
Of course.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.582
Caleb, please.

10:07.070 --> 10:08.935
Can I borrow your eye?

10:10.270 --> 10:12.033
Sure.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.879
Tell me if this is slanted.

10:13.910 --> 10:15.878
And don't lie to me.

10:15.910 --> 10:18.777
I'll think I aced it
and I'll live to regret it.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.141
I regret a lot.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.909
I spend my days paddling
through a stew of regrets.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.981
It's perfect.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.908
Wow. _
You're a really good liar.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.712
( door closing )

10:30.060 --> 10:31.027
9:325:22

10:31.060 --> 10:32.425
I understand that, Andre,

10:32.460 --> 10:34.621
but scallops
are not part of the budget.

10:35.430 --> 10:36.727
What?

10:36.770 --> 10:37.919
He keeps putting me on hold.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.961
Well, tell him to stick
to the original plan.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.231
And that was, like,
three plans ago.

10:43.270 --> 10:44.339
Oh, he's coming
tomorrow night.

10:44.370 --> 10:45.359
You should really
talk to him.

10:45.410 --> 10:46.934
He teaches at Vassar.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.038
Have you heard
from them yet?

10:48.080 --> 10:51.140
Um, no, no.
Not yet.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.875
Andre, still here.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.911
So listen, we need to go back
to the original plan.

10:54.950 --> 10:57.418
Because it's a bookstore.

10:57.450 --> 11:01.284
Nobody is coming here
for the tamarind dipping sauce.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.459
What?
( loud click)

11:03.490 --> 11:04.855
He just quit on me.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.725
I can do it.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.897
Do what?

11:08.930 --> 11:10.397
Cater your party.

11:10.430 --> 11:12.830
Pays more than
a barista, right?

11:12.870 --> 11:13.689
Did I miss something?

11:13.740 --> 11:15.093
When did you become
a professional chef?

11:15.140 --> 11:16.437
I've been helping my mom
in the kitchen

11:16.470 --> 11:17.732
since I could walk.

11:17.770 --> 11:18.998
Let me do it.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.874
Yeah, I'm sure
it'll be amazing.

11:22.910 --> 11:25.071
It's not like Emily's a stranger
in that kitchen.

11:25.110 --> 11:27.374
And your guests are gonna
be here in less than 27 hours,

11:27.420 --> 11:29.911
so we could either debate this
or I could get started,

11:29.950 --> 11:32.441
stick to your budget
and blow you away.
Your choice.

11:32.490 --> 11:34.378
Did you even take Home Ec?

11:36.860 --> 11:39.124
Sorry.
Go for it, Emily.

11:40.530 --> 11:42.964
( phone ringing )

11:43.000 --> 11:44.422
Hello?

11:44.470 --> 11:46.097
AUTOMATED OPERATOR:
This call is from

11:46.130 --> 11:47.495
The Chester Women's
Correctional Facility.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.167
You have a call
from inmate--

11:49.200 --> 11:51.100
ALISON: ( recorded voice )
Alison DiLaurentis.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.266
AUTOMATED OPERATOR:
If you would like

11:52.310 --> 11:54.130
to accept this call,
press one.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.110
ALISON: Jason?

12:00.150 --> 12:03.381
Uh, no, Alison.
It's Hanna's mom.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.810
Mrs. Marin,
is my brother there?

12:06.860 --> 12:07.952
Your brother?

12:09.560 --> 12:11.881
Can I speak with him,
please?

12:11.930 --> 12:13.955
He's...

12:15.200 --> 12:16.929
not able to do this
right now.

12:16.970 --> 12:17.994
Can you call back tomorrow?

12:18.030 --> 12:19.998
I need to talk to him.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.769
I'm sorry, Alison.
You'll have to call back
another time.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.799
Please don't make me
do that again.

12:46.830 --> 12:49.867
Saying no is not as hard
as taking the call.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.289
Have you seen her since--

12:52.330 --> 12:57.108
Once.
I can't go back.

12:57.140 --> 12:59.335
I can't even look at her now
without thinking

12:59.370 --> 13:02.498
she might've had something to do
with what happened to my mom.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.377
That building,
where the student union is,

13:09.420 --> 13:11.183
that's the original college.

13:11.220 --> 13:12.084
Founding father
Eustace Ballard

13:12.120 --> 13:14.088
laid the first brick
of foundation himself.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.452
I can show you
a plaque carved in wood

13:16.490 --> 13:17.582
from Mr. Ballard's outhouse.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.188
Okay.

13:19.230 --> 13:21.152
Did I mention_ _
Ballard was also a minister?

13:21.200 --> 13:22.997
Yeah, you did.

13:23.030 --> 13:25.191
Remember, and then I told you
that my mom was dating one?

13:25.230 --> 13:27.164
Oh, right.
Cool beans.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.236
Let me grab us
a weekend calendar.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.005
CALEB: ( on phone ) Hey.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.041
Save me.
What's wrong?

13:39.080 --> 13:41.048
My buddy
has verbal diarrhea.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.219
The _back of_ a cereal box is
more interesting than this girl.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.184
Sorry.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.415
That was supposed
to make you laugh.
Are you okay?

13:51.060 --> 13:53.028
Toby was on a search
at Mona's property

13:53.060 --> 13:56.120
and found a bloody knife.
What?

13:56.160 --> 13:57.866
It's from
the Cavanaugh's cabin.

13:57.900 --> 14:01.267
Who put it there?
Holbrook?

14:01.300 --> 14:02.494
Caleb, I'm coming home.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.167
No.
You're not, okay?

14:04.210 --> 14:07.099
That is exactly what "A" wants,
for you to drop everything.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.175
Don't.

14:15.220 --> 14:18.018
Hanna? Hanna?

14:21.060 --> 14:23.255
Hey. Can I show you something
before Ezra gets back?

14:23.290 --> 14:25.087
Here.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.586
So I spent all of last period
in the library

14:26.630 --> 14:28.222
writing my letter
to Talmadge.

14:28.260 --> 14:30.467
And I don't want
to sound desperate,

14:30.500 --> 14:32.593
but I just figured, you know,
if they see, like,

14:32.630 --> 14:34.097
a hundred of these
every day--

14:34.140 --> 14:36.563
No, it's good, but--

14:36.600 --> 14:38.329
What?

14:38.370 --> 14:40.099
You need to make it
more personal.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.402
Personal?

14:41.440 --> 14:44.238
What-- What do you want
me to tell them?

14:44.280 --> 14:46.919
That I spent all of junior year
being hunted down by "A"?

14:46.950 --> 14:48.372
Aria, that's--

14:48.420 --> 14:50.342
Yeah, and I wanted
to write this,
like, 2 weeks earlier,

14:50.390 --> 14:51.948
but I was too busy being
suffocated by a plastic sheet?

14:51.990 --> 14:53.309
You're spiraling again.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.612
No, you can't spiral, Emily,
if you've already crashed.

14:55.660 --> 14:58.925
Talmadge was supposed
to be my slam-dunk.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.622
Then yesterday I got a letter
that was all slam and no dunk

15:01.660 --> 15:03.298
and I've already missed
every other deadline.

15:03.330 --> 15:04.922
So if I don't get bumped up
from this wait-list,

15:04.970 --> 15:06.267
I don't get to go
to college next fall.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.494
( door opens )

15:10.470 --> 15:13.030
I'm going to call my mom.

15:25.190 --> 15:29.388
I didn't know
how to tell you this,
but nobody wants me.

15:29.420 --> 15:32.082
Aria, that's not true.

15:32.130 --> 15:34.519
There are
many, many, many
great colleges

15:34.560 --> 15:36.152
that you can apply to
in the future.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.521
No, I mean,
I can write a better letter.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.265
You could write
The Grapes of Wrath,

15:40.300 --> 15:41.528
anditsﬁ”
wouldn't matter.

15:41.570 --> 15:44.232
Talmadge recently hired
Jackie Molina

15:44.270 --> 15:45.567
as an Admissions Officer.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.578
Jackie?

15:47.610 --> 15:50.272
As in your ex Jackie,
who hates my guts?

15:50.310 --> 15:53.211
You forgot to mention that
she hates my guts even more.

15:53.250 --> 15:57.584
Look, I know it hurts,
but it's a temporary setback.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.542
That's all. Promise.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.157
( knocking on door)

16:09.760 --> 16:11.193
Seriously?

16:11.230 --> 16:12.993
I mean, the shelf life
on secrets around here

16:13.040 --> 16:14.439
has reached
an all-time low.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.461
I know.
I shouldn't have told her.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.206
You could've at least
warned me

16:18.240 --> 16:20.333
before I was carpet-bombed
with angry texts.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.007
Why was she angry?

16:22.040 --> 16:23.371
Because I didn't tell her.

16:23.410 --> 16:25.275
And I had to beg her
not to tell Aria and Emily.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.078
What is that?

16:33.290 --> 16:35.349
You're going back for it,
aren't you?

16:35.390 --> 16:37.426
Spencer, if my prints
are on that...

16:40.300 --> 16:43.428
I can't get hauled away
on suspicion of murder.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.620
Again.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.262
"Again"?

16:49.300 --> 16:51.564
Look, I'm sure that
Hanna has told you
some stuff about my past.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.469
But there are things
I haven't even told her.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.273
What did you do?

17:07.260 --> 17:09.216
I hacked for some dudes
in Allentown,

17:09.260 --> 17:12.229
some credit card
number scam.

17:12.260 --> 17:13.522
When one of them
turned up dead,

17:13.560 --> 17:15.255
the other one pointed
the finger at me.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.597
I mean,
I was easy to railroad.

17:16.630 --> 17:18.461
I'd bailed
from my foster home.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.728
I was living
on the streets.

17:19.770 --> 17:21.362
What happened?

17:21.400 --> 17:24.699
One of the detectives saw _
that I was just some stupid kid

17:24.740 --> 17:26.765
who'd made_
some stupid deCI5ions.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.232
He got me released.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.648
But if I get taken in
on a charge like that,

17:32.680 --> 17:37.344
I'm not gonna have
somebody there to look after me.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.085
I'm not
a stupid kid anymore.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.557
You're gonna go
tell Toby now?

17:49.830 --> 17:52.424
No.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.495
I'm coming with you.

18:03.410 --> 18:06.641
* And you burn, burn, burn
your life down *

18:09.380 --> 18:14.386
* And you burn, burn,
burn your life down *

18:17.430 --> 18:19.125
* I drive around the block

18:19.160 --> 18:20.525
* And I'm not looking
to my right *

18:20.560 --> 18:22.425
* I feel the glass
against my cheek *

18:22.460 --> 18:24.792
* And I can't see you
in the light *

18:24.830 --> 18:29.267
* I break my heart
around this *

18:29.300 --> 18:32.804
* Break my heart
around this *

18:32.840 --> 18:34.432
* I drive around the block

18:34.480 --> 18:35.902
* And I'm not looking
to my right *

18:35.940 --> 18:37.805
* I feel the glass
against my cheek *

18:37.850 --> 18:40.341
* And I can't see you
in the light *

18:40.380 --> 18:44.339
* I break my heart
around this *

18:44.390 --> 18:50.488
* Break my heart
around this pole *

18:56.530 --> 18:58.259
What about the fillings?

18:58.300 --> 18:59.369
I mean, do I start
with that first,

18:59.400 --> 19:00.537
or should I maybe be doing--

19:00.570 --> 19:03.209
Oh, Mom,
uh, let me call you right back.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.401
Okay, thanks.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.532
Hey.

19:06.570 --> 19:07.639
I thought you went home
to crash.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.898
I did.
But I couldn't sleep.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.544
Nervous about tomorrow?

19:11.580 --> 19:13.309
No, I swerved
right past nervous

19:13.350 --> 19:15.511
and went into a full-blown
panic attack.

19:15.550 --> 19:18.940
Emily, should we be
calling in some... help?

19:18.990 --> 19:20.287
What do you mean?

19:20.320 --> 19:21.912
Like a professional chef.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.723
Why?

19:23.760 --> 19:26.627
No, everything is
totally under control.

19:26.660 --> 19:27.854
Food is gonna be awesome.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.424
Okay.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.325
We're gonna be eating dinner
off the walls?

19:32.370 --> 19:33.564
That was an experiment.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.431
But I just spoke to my mom

19:35.470 --> 19:37.665
and she gave me
her famous empanada recipe.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.804
Great.
Because I can always call
a restaurant or I can ask--

19:40.840 --> 19:42.398
No. Don't.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.305
There is no need to panic.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.204
Everything is
gonna be great.

19:52.420 --> 19:55.480
( dog barking )

20:07.600 --> 20:10.637
( baby wailing )

20:13.540 --> 20:17.442
( cell phone ringing )

20:17.480 --> 20:18.606
Hi.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.277
ASHLEY: ( on phone )
Hey, sweetie, how's it going?

20:22.020 --> 20:23.510
It's going great.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.518
I can't hear you.
Where are you?

20:26.920 --> 20:28.456
I'm at the library.

20:28.490 --> 20:31.584
Nice. Is it impressive?

20:31.630 --> 20:33.848
Oh, yeah.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.619
Mom, I really have to get off
the phone soon though.

20:36.660 --> 20:38.525
Of course.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.391
I just wanted to make sure
you're on the alert,

20:41.440 --> 20:42.498
if you're taken
to any parties.

20:42.540 --> 20:43.529
I just--

20:43.570 --> 20:46.232
Mom, I have to--
I have to go.

20:51.950 --> 20:54.544
Um, where is 2-1-1?

20:57.550 --> 20:59.689
Thank you.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.552
Oh. Hello.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.895
I'm looking
for a Mr. Holbrook.

21:12.930 --> 21:14.466
Poppa!

21:28.620 --> 21:29.746
This is crazy.

21:29.780 --> 21:31.611
This would be hard enough
in the day.

21:31.650 --> 21:32.639
We have to find it.

21:32.690 --> 21:33.816
We can't see anything.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.613
Spencer,
we have to find it.

21:44.030 --> 21:45.691
What can I do for you?

21:47.440 --> 21:49.431
I'm looking
for a Detective Holbrook.

21:49.470 --> 21:51.700
I'm his father.
Who are you?

21:51.740 --> 21:53.628
A friend of his.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.602
Is he around?

21:55.640 --> 21:57.403
Haven't seen him in weeks.

21:57.450 --> 22:01.443
Oh. I thought
he was taking care of you.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.688
Do you know
where I could find him?

22:04.720 --> 22:07.018
I figured if anyone knew
where he was, it'd be you.

22:10.090 --> 22:11.489
You out on bail?

22:11.530 --> 22:14.727
Uh, no.

22:15.860 --> 22:18.727
College weekend.

22:18.770 --> 22:21.534
I'd better get going.

22:41.020 --> 22:43.750
Caleb.

23:41.720 --> 23:48.819
( gasps )

24:02.740 --> 24:04.002
So what time
did you get home?

24:05.740 --> 24:07.674
About 3 hours ago.

24:07.710 --> 24:08.802
Sorry you didn't tell me.
I woke you up.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.070
Who says I went to sleep?

24:11.110 --> 24:12.646
She still
hasn't written me back.

24:12.680 --> 24:13.669
VVho?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.676
Paige.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.869
When's the last time
you two...

24:16.920 --> 24:18.114
Forget it.

24:18.150 --> 24:19.708
Let me read it.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.859
What?

24:33.900 --> 24:36.789
This is your way
of getting personal?

24:36.840 --> 24:39.866
Yeah.
If I'm pitching
myself to Jackie,

24:39.910 --> 24:41.002
why not lob it
over the plate?

24:41.040 --> 24:43.600
Tell me
you didn't send this.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.777
Why? It's right
in her sweet spot.

24:45.810 --> 24:48.677
"I regret that I squandered
my high school career,

24:48.720 --> 24:49.948
getting involved
with an older guy.

24:49.980 --> 24:53.586
I was robbed of all the _rituals
that my classmates enjoyed.

24:53.620 --> 24:55.679
This secret relationship
kept me in a fishbowl,

24:55.720 --> 24:58.120
separating me from my family,
my friends, even myself."

24:58.160 --> 25:00.890
Okay, I don't need
a dramatic reading,

25:00.930 --> 25:01.999
Emily, I wrote it.

25:02.030 --> 25:04.066
If Ezra saw this,
he'd be so hurt.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.159
No, he wouldn't.
No.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.794
He would know
exactly what I'm doing.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.866
And once I get accepted,
I can just take back every word.

25:11.910 --> 25:12.934
Please tell me you
didn't send this.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.198
Why do you keep saying that?

25:14.240 --> 25:15.935
Yes, I sent it,
I emailed it last night.

25:15.980 --> 25:17.231
It's done.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.908
( cell phone buzzes )

25:19.950 --> 25:21.975
Oh, shoot.
I got to go.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.169
Why?

25:23.220 --> 25:25.040
Because I have
200 empanadas to fill.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.751
That is so amazing.

25:30.790 --> 25:32.929
Oh, my gosh.
What is that spice?

25:32.960 --> 25:34.928
I'm so glad you like this.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.825
Hmm, Emily, I want
you to meet somebody.

25:36.860 --> 25:38.794
Talia Sandoval,
Emily Fields.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.639
Hi, it's nice
to meet you.

25:40.670 --> 25:42.695
What's going on?

25:42.740 --> 25:45.903
Oh, I asked Talia to help
out tonight in the kitchen.

25:45.940 --> 25:48.636
I don't understand.

25:48.680 --> 25:53.071
Um, well,
I would just prefer that
you come tonight as a guest.

25:53.110 --> 25:55.078
I don't want to be a guest.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.109
You hired me to--

25:56.150 --> 25:57.640
I know, I know.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.783
But I think that we can both
relax knowing that

25:59.820 --> 26:01.788
there's a professional
back there in the kitchen.

26:01.820 --> 26:04.880
Let's just think of Talia
like a savior.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.899
You know that I'm gonna pay you
for the work you did last night.

26:07.930 --> 26:11.058
Yeah, it's not just
about last night.

26:11.100 --> 26:14.968
I was hoping I could maybe
become more than a barista.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.730
Okay, I didn't realize.

26:17.770 --> 26:20.830
Well, we can revisit that
at a later day.

26:20.880 --> 26:25.203
Right.
I've work to do.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.111
Ugh.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.015
What is this?

26:32.050 --> 26:34.712
It's filling for empanadas.

26:35.860 --> 26:38.078
Excuse me.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.962
You know, if the dough's been
in the fridge all night,

26:48.000 --> 26:49.262
you may want to--

26:49.300 --> 26:51.837
IfI wanted advice,
I'd ask my mother.

26:51.870 --> 26:54.077
We go way back.

26:54.110 --> 26:56.135
( knocking on door)

26:56.180 --> 26:57.977
Caleb,
what are you doing here?

26:58.010 --> 27:00.843
What happened?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.245
I couldn't do it.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.372
What do you mean
you couldn't do it?

27:03.420 --> 27:05.980
I felt like
I was being followed.

27:06.020 --> 27:08.853
I drove to the lake
and when I got there, I...

27:08.890 --> 27:10.289
I just couldn't do it.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.288
Okay, fine,
I'll do it then.

27:12.330 --> 27:14.924
Wait. _
Don't you get it?

27:14.960 --> 27:16.928
As long as that knife exists,

27:16.960 --> 27:18.166
"A" is gonna find a way
to get it back.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.959
Then we make it not exist.

27:24.070 --> 27:26.368
Do we even know
how to turn this kiln on?

27:26.410 --> 27:30.232
Hang on, I'm looking it up.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.999
It's got to be
one of these switches, right?

27:33.050 --> 27:36.019
Yeah, maybe this one?

27:45.160 --> 27:47.048
I don't know
if I got it working.

27:47.090 --> 27:49.058
I don't know.
Let's just try it.

27:49.100 --> 27:52.228
( footsteps approaching )

28:37.110 --> 28:38.179
Hey!

28:38.210 --> 28:40.098
Spencer!

29:04.040 --> 29:06.133
I think there are still
a few changes I'd like to make

29:06.170 --> 29:07.068
so we're sure
we're getting the most--

29:07.110 --> 29:09.032
Hi, Jackie?

29:09.080 --> 29:12.072
Um, it's Aria Montgomery.

29:12.110 --> 29:14.078
Do you remember me?

29:14.120 --> 29:17.078
I'll see you later, Jeff.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.212
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt your--

29:18.250 --> 29:20.514
What are you doing here?
Don't you live
in Pennsylvania?

29:20.550 --> 29:25.089
Yeah.
It's a long story.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.451
I applied here,
and then I was wait-listed,

29:27.490 --> 29:31.119
and then last night I emailed
a letter to the Admissions Board

29:31.170 --> 29:33.161
that I would really
like to delete...

29:34.070 --> 29:35.059
if possible.

29:35.100 --> 29:36.988
Why do you want
to delete it?

29:37.040 --> 29:38.507
Jackie, it's--
it's complicated.

29:38.540 --> 29:40.201
I don't want to have
to get into the details.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.502
Oh, you sure did
in your letter.

29:41.540 --> 29:44.373
Is that why
you rushed up here?

29:44.410 --> 29:46.503
You're worried I'm gonna share
the contents with Ezra?

29:49.180 --> 29:50.818
Don't.

29:50.850 --> 29:53.114
Your secret's safe with me.

29:53.150 --> 29:56.119
IfI never spoke to him again,
it would be way too soon.

29:58.290 --> 29:59.552
Thank you.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.126
After I read your letter,

30:01.160 --> 30:03.390
I thought about
all the time I wasted

30:03.430 --> 30:05.068
believing he was somebody
he wasn't.

30:05.100 --> 30:08.228
I wish they'd invent
a pacemaker

30:08.270 --> 30:09.464
that zapped your heart
every moment

30:09.500 --> 30:12.139
you started falling
for Mr. Wrong.

30:12.170 --> 30:15.298
Would save a lot of girls
from making a huge mistake.

30:15.340 --> 30:17.205
Not just us.

30:41.470 --> 30:43.392
Caleb?

30:55.080 --> 30:56.069
Caleb!

30:56.120 --> 30:58.088
Oh, my God.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.542
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

31:02.390 --> 31:03.357
Caleb!

31:03.390 --> 31:05.255
Oh, my God.

31:05.290 --> 31:07.258
Oh, my God,
what happened?

31:07.290 --> 31:08.359
Caleb!
Oh, my God.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.527
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

31:10.560 --> 31:12.664
( door closes )

31:12.700 --> 31:14.258
Did the door shut by accident?

31:14.300 --> 31:15.460
I don't know.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.434
Where's the knife?
Is it in there?

31:42.230 --> 31:43.424
Surprise, surprise.

31:43.460 --> 31:46.258
Who did you think it was?

31:46.300 --> 31:47.164
Holbrook?

31:49.170 --> 31:51.206
Look, Alison,
this isn't a visit.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.162
I came here _
to tell you one thing.

31:53.210 --> 31:55.235
Give up.

31:55.280 --> 31:59.307
I still know you,
at least some of you.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.568
And I know that at every turn
you've chosen to fight.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.349
But just this once, don't.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.688
I already have given up.

32:04.720 --> 32:07.143
That's why I'm here.

32:07.190 --> 32:09.488
I could have thrown you all
under the bus, but I didn't.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.283
I kept my mouth shut.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.149
But do I get a thanks for it?

32:12.190 --> 32:14.454
What are we supposed
to thank you for?

32:14.500 --> 32:16.252
Framing Spencer?

32:16.300 --> 32:17.324
Putting a knife in Mona's—-

32:17.360 --> 32:18.395
What knife?

32:18.430 --> 32:22.230
Look, if I was clever
as everyone thinks that I am,

32:22.270 --> 32:24.409
wouldn't I have given myself
a better alibi than my brother?

32:27.310 --> 32:28.607
You want to know
where I was

32:28.640 --> 32:31.200
for those missing hours
on Thanksgiving?

32:31.250 --> 32:33.241
I was waiting for Cyrus.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.316
I got a message from him
asking to meet.

32:35.350 --> 32:36.248
He sounded freaked out
and I was worried

32:36.280 --> 32:38.248
that he was gonna expose
our deal, so I went.

32:38.290 --> 32:43.182
I waited for hours for him
and he never showed.

32:43.220 --> 32:44.619
It was only when I heard
that Mona was missing

32:44.660 --> 32:49.552
that I realized that this was
just a trap set by "A."

32:49.600 --> 32:52.592
I would've never been able
to explain that to the police.

32:52.630 --> 32:55.531
I couldn't even tell
my own father.

32:55.570 --> 32:57.367
But he lied for me
anyway.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.198
Hanna, if I was "A,"

33:00.240 --> 33:03.505
why would
I let this happen to me?

33:03.540 --> 33:06.373
I don't know.

33:06.410 --> 33:08.275
But I do know that
if you are "A,"

33:08.320 --> 33:11.244
you're counting
on that last little shred of me

33:11.290 --> 33:14.589
that gives a damn about
what happens to you.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.212
And you shouldn't.

33:26.070 --> 33:29.289
( indistinct chatter )

33:39.450 --> 33:40.644
Em, hey.
Hi, have you seen Toby?

33:40.680 --> 33:42.671
No.
Take an empanada.

33:42.720 --> 33:43.744
No, thanks.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.418
What do you mean,
"no, thanks"?

33:45.450 --> 33:46.747
I made these.
Eat one.

33:46.790 --> 33:48.417
Uh, Ijust walked in.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.314
And you're starving.
Eat it.

33:54.260 --> 33:55.352
Wasn't Caleb
coming with you?

33:55.400 --> 33:56.424
He bailed.

33:56.460 --> 33:58.496
He just wasn't up to it.

33:58.530 --> 34:00.669
Em, there's a hair in this.

34:00.700 --> 34:04.033
Just eat around it, okay?

34:07.640 --> 34:08.834
There you go.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.131
I'm so sorry.

34:10.180 --> 34:12.068
Who is that?

34:12.110 --> 34:14.044
I don't want
to talk about it.

34:15.650 --> 34:17.277
Melissa?

34:17.320 --> 34:18.810
Are you Melissa Hastings?

34:18.850 --> 34:21.284
Uh, no, that's my sister.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.459
Oh, that's a relief.
Why is that a relief?

34:23.490 --> 34:25.151
Because I'm not looking
for a roommate.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.385
Your mom told my mom that
I could rent your guesthouse.

34:27.430 --> 34:28.454
Wait.
When did this happen?

34:28.500 --> 34:30.650
Our moms are friends?
Kind of.

34:30.700 --> 34:32.793
Your mom sued my granny's
nursing home for my mom.

34:32.830 --> 34:34.434
Have you tried
these crab cakes yet?

34:34.470 --> 34:36.290
They're awesome,
they're like the new party drug.

34:36.340 --> 34:37.693
Thank you for the tip.

34:37.740 --> 34:39.332
I'm Jonny.
Raymond.

34:39.370 --> 34:40.439
You're...

34:40.470 --> 34:41.607
Spencer Hastings.

34:41.640 --> 34:43.574
The sister who hasn't
checked out yet.

34:43.610 --> 34:45.544
I'm psyched about the space.

34:45.580 --> 34:46.842
I don't think that
you really should be.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.438
You don't want to live
in our baclqard.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.469
Why?

34:49.520 --> 34:51.385
Because somebody
was buried in it.

34:51.420 --> 34:53.149
Will you excuse me?

34:55.720 --> 34:57.608
Oh, don't do that.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.252
Hey, they can be saved.

34:59.290 --> 35:00.826
Okay, you know what,
I'm not looking for a savior.

35:00.860 --> 35:04.125
Emily, if I told you
how may times I bombed

35:04.170 --> 35:06.422
before I perfected
even one signature dish--

35:06.470 --> 35:09.667
I didn't take this on
to flaunt my brand, okay?

35:09.700 --> 35:12.168
I needed the cash
to save a relationship,

35:12.210 --> 35:13.700
which actually
doesn't make sense

35:13.740 --> 35:16.504
because that relationship
doesn't exist anymore.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.849
And now I'm stuck here,
making plans to go
and see someone

35:18.880 --> 35:21.348
who's moved
across the country,
started a new life,

35:21.380 --> 35:24.645
and can't even find a _second_to
return any of my stupid emails.

35:24.690 --> 35:25.645
Okay?

35:25.690 --> 35:28.488
Emily, Emily.
Okay, okay.

35:28.520 --> 35:29.817
May I?

35:34.530 --> 35:37.556
So the first kitchen
that I ever worked in

35:37.600 --> 35:39.522
had a hard and fast rule.

35:39.570 --> 35:43.836
Just about any tapas
can be rescued

35:43.870 --> 35:48.569
with either som_e slivered
almonds or the right sauce.

35:52.580 --> 35:54.172
Oh, come on, just try it.

35:54.220 --> 35:58.782
Look, if you hate it,
you can spit it in my face.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.262
( doorbell rings )

36:11.300 --> 36:12.858
I didn't expect you
to be home.

36:12.900 --> 36:15.266
I was just gonna leave these.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.562
Were you at the office today?

36:16.600 --> 36:18.807
Yeah, I figured I could use
a Saturday to catch up.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.673
But some of the papenNork
didn't make sense.

36:21.710 --> 36:24.577
We have_a tenant whose lease
expired 3 years ago.

36:24.610 --> 36:27.943
I'm happy to take a look at it
and see ifI can sort it out.

36:27.980 --> 36:29.140
Great.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.489
Do you want me to drop it off
to your house tomorrow or...

36:31.520 --> 36:33.488
I'm staying at the Edgewood.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.851
Oh.

36:34.890 --> 36:36.448
My father made it
very clear

36:36.490 --> 36:39.584
I'm not welcome since
my Sister... left.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.552
Why?

36:41.600 --> 36:45.320
Probably because I'm the one
who got her arrested.

36:49.600 --> 36:50.635
Have you eaten?

37:04.950 --> 37:06.611
I've been looking for you.

37:06.650 --> 37:09.517
There's somebody that
I really want you to meet.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.289
Bob.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.388
So sorry.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.455
Bob, this is the young lady
I was telling you about.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.549
Aria, this is Bob Milsom,
who teaches at Vassar.

37:17.600 --> 37:21.263
I thought that one gifted writer
would appreciate another.

37:33.550 --> 37:35.541
Toby, wait.

37:35.580 --> 37:37.548
Toby!

37:37.580 --> 37:39.741
You looked me in the eye
and then you deliberately
went behind my back--

37:39.790 --> 37:41.189
So did you!

37:41.220 --> 37:44.929
How else would you've known
that the knife was gone?
You went back, too.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.689
Because I wanted
to do the right thing.

37:46.730 --> 37:48.357
Yeah,
if you thought that,

37:48.400 --> 37:51.699
then you would've
picked it up the first time.

37:51.730 --> 37:53.561
You know, you keep on talking
about the right thing

37:53.600 --> 37:55.568
as if we've no idea
what it is.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.591
But in this case,
we needed to protect ourselves

37:57.640 --> 37:58.834
and that meant
getting rid of it, okay?

37:58.870 --> 38:00.701
Spencer--
So it's done.
It's destroyed.

38:00.740 --> 38:03.300
Spencer, I can't--
Caleb and I, we got it--

38:03.340 --> 38:05.649
I can't. Listen to this!
Don't you understand
you're making it worse?

38:05.680 --> 38:06.749
There are things
that I can't know about,

38:06.780 --> 38:09.669
things that
you can't say out loud.

38:15.390 --> 38:17.654
You told me once that
I could tell you anything.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.329
I've got to go.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.576
Maybe Jessica had a verbal
agreement with these tenants.

38:43.620 --> 38:45.110
Probably.

38:45.150 --> 38:48.711
People thought my mom was
a hard-ass, but truth is,

38:48.760 --> 38:51.058
she used to cry
at dog food commercials.

38:51.090 --> 38:52.785
Me, too.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.388
I don't even have a dog.

38:56.030 --> 38:58.089
If you're gonna live in this
big house all by yourself.

38:58.130 --> 39:01.531
Don't remind me.

39:01.570 --> 39:03.629
The day Hanna moves out...

39:05.140 --> 39:09.907
I'm just not as fond of my
own company as I used to be.

39:09.940 --> 39:11.032
Why's that?

39:11.080 --> 39:13.105
I don't know.

39:13.150 --> 39:15.744
So much has happened
the last few years.

39:15.780 --> 39:20.979
I think I'm scared
of the white noise in my head.

39:21.020 --> 39:22.885
I can relate.

39:26.790 --> 39:29.122
Can I get you anything
else to drink?
I have decaf.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.526
I'm fine.

39:32.770 --> 39:34.738
Let me take your plate.

39:42.740 --> 39:43.775
I'm sorry.

39:46.510 --> 39:49.741
Consider that
a thank-you.
For dinner.

39:51.790 --> 39:55.055
That's all right.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.581
I don't mind being thanked.

40:11.840 --> 40:12.909
Hey.

40:12.940 --> 40:13.929
Why were you late?

40:13.970 --> 40:15.073
Did you make it up
to Talmadge?

40:15.110 --> 40:16.975
Were you able to stop--

40:17.010 --> 40:19.103
No.
Jackie read it.

40:19.150 --> 40:19.900
Oh, no.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.815
Is she gonna
forward it to Ezra?

40:21.850 --> 40:23.818
Oh, no.

40:23.850 --> 40:24.817
It's our secret.

40:24.850 --> 40:28.752
But it worked.

40:30.560 --> 40:31.754
What're you gonna tell Ezra?

40:31.790 --> 40:33.519
Tonight?

40:33.560 --> 40:35.824
Nothing.
I can't.

40:40.770 --> 40:43.659
So thanks to you,
I'm really screwed.

40:43.700 --> 40:45.565
I'm scared to ask, but why?

40:45.610 --> 40:47.168
Everybody is raving
about your food.

40:47.210 --> 40:49.929
Seriously, what am I gonna do
when I open this place up?

40:49.980 --> 40:51.902
You know where to find me.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.686
Hey, Emily,

40:58.720 --> 41:02.110
I don't want you to feel
resentful or unappreciated.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.149
Hire her.

41:03.190 --> 41:04.680
What?

41:04.730 --> 41:06.254
I'll get over it.

41:06.290 --> 41:08.895
Besides, she can't touch
what I can do with a cappuccino.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.281
( door closes )
