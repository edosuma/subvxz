00:07.341 --> 00:09.041
- ¶

00:09.043 --> 00:11.844
- You can't make us go to
school in this windstorm.

00:11.846 --> 00:12.878
You have to let us skip.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.115
- We'll let you skip
school when pigs fly.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.050
- [pig squealing]

00:18.052 --> 00:21.220
- Flying pig!
- No school!

00:21.222 --> 00:23.288
- You still have to go.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.124
- Guys, it's only
a bit of wind.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.860
You just have to
dress for it.

00:27.862 --> 00:31.530
- Wow, you found a helmet
that fits your pointy head.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.565
- Yeah, and it also
does this...

00:33.567 --> 00:35.300
- Ow!

00:36.303 --> 00:37.102
- All right, Chloe,

00:37.104 --> 00:38.871
we need you to teleport
us to school again.

00:38.873 --> 00:42.007
- You still owe me candy
for the last time I took you.

00:42.009 --> 00:44.443
- Well, let me grab
you a piece from my--

00:44.445 --> 00:45.477
Grab her, Billy!

00:45.479 --> 00:47.513
- CHLOE:
[whooshing]

00:47.515 --> 00:49.281
- Got her.

00:49.283 --> 00:52.217
- Guess I should have
been more specific.

00:52.219 --> 00:55.154
- Kids, quit messin' around
and get to school.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.056
- Yeah. Do we have
to tell you the story

00:57.058 --> 01:00.192
about Heinrich
Hiddenville III again?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.060
- KIDS:
No!

01:01.062 --> 01:03.429
- Our mayor...
- KIDS: [groaning]

01:03.431 --> 01:04.530
- ...Heinrich
Hiddenville III,

01:04.532 --> 01:06.632
grandson of our
our town's founder,

01:06.634 --> 01:09.935
always went to school
no matter what.

01:09.937 --> 01:13.305
- Even on
November 4th, 1955,

01:13.307 --> 01:17.109
when young Heinrich
was attacked by a bear.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.944
[growling]
- HANK: [screams]

01:18.946 --> 01:23.482
He used his trusty pencil
to scare the bear away!

01:23.484 --> 01:28.587
- [gasping]
Oh, I'm bear-y frightened.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.123
- Yeah, we all
are, guys.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.925
- Not only did he
make it to school,

01:32.927 --> 01:35.194
but he won a dance
contest that night.

01:35.196 --> 01:38.497
- And he became so popular that
he was voted class president.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.999
- Which made him want
to be mayor one day.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.468
Blah, blah, lies.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.002
- No, it's true.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.471
- Oh, sweet, sweet Mother,

01:45.473 --> 01:47.673
you don't need to trick me
with some fake mayor story.

01:47.675 --> 01:51.477
I'd go to school on Saturdays,
if it weren't trespassing.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.378
- Yeah, and if you're
gonna make up stories,

01:53.380 --> 01:55.114
at least throw in
some mermaids.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.548
People like mermaids.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.617
- I don't like mermaids.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.519
- Yoo-hoo!
- Who is that?

02:00.521 --> 02:03.422
- You'd better hope
it's not a mermaid.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.693
- BLOBBIN: [screaming]
- [wind howling]

02:07.695 --> 02:11.230
- BLOBBIN:
[straining]

02:11.232 --> 02:11.697
[groans]

02:11.699 --> 02:13.298
- Cousin Blobbin,
are you okay?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.367
- Hi-ya! Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

02:15.369 --> 02:17.269
- [chair clatters]

02:17.271 --> 02:19.404
- A simple, "I'm fine"
would've been cool.

02:19.406 --> 02:22.241
- COLOSSO: Is that
my breakfast burrito?

02:22.243 --> 02:24.710
Oh, hi, Blobbin.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.679
- Hi, ThunderCousos.
[sighing]

02:27.681 --> 02:28.447
I've got good news.

02:28.449 --> 02:33.252
I'm treating you to
an all-expense-paid vacation...

02:33.254 --> 02:35.120
- THUNDERMANS:
Yay!

02:35.122 --> 02:36.555
- ...in my cozy timeshare.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.689
- [wind howling]

02:37.691 --> 02:39.291
- THUNDERMANS:
Ohhhh...

02:39.293 --> 02:40.425
- Oh, come on,
it'll be fun.

02:40.427 --> 02:43.162
- Uh, I wish we could,
but we have school.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.029
- School. Yes.
[laughs]

02:44.031 --> 02:45.731
I knew it'd come
in handy one day.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.698
- How about you two?

02:46.700 --> 02:49.434
Who needs a...
¶ Vacay ¶

02:49.436 --> 02:51.336
- Well, we have to...

02:51.338 --> 02:53.705
- Uh, give Colosso a bath.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.674
- A bath? Never!

02:55.676 --> 02:58.043
Viva la stink!

02:58.045 --> 02:59.711
- See what we're
dealing with?

02:59.713 --> 03:01.313
Sorry, but we're
a no-go.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.448
- Okay, but if you
change your mind--

03:03.450 --> 03:06.185
- Oh, we won't.
Bye, Blobbin.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.153
- [wind howling]

03:09.190 --> 03:09.788
- And bye, kids.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.291
Have fun at school!
- We will!

03:12.293 --> 03:15.127
- [wind howling]

03:16.530 --> 03:18.297
- Should we give
them a ride?

03:18.299 --> 03:21.400
- In this wind?
[laughing] No, thank you.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.804
- [wind howling]

03:25.806 --> 03:29.741
- Oh, that was the worst
walk to school ever.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.211
- How is your hair
still so perfect?

03:32.213 --> 03:33.078
- Please, Phoebe.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.814
Nothing's takin' down
my swoosh.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.383
Hey, guys.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.685
Your parents tell you
that bogus story, too?

03:39.687 --> 03:42.621
- Yeah. They tricked me
by making it a puppet show.

03:42.623 --> 03:47.292
And you know me--I am
not easily tricked.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.161
- Wolfgang's lucky.

03:49.163 --> 03:51.330
I bet his host family
didn't make him come in.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.099
- WOLFGANG:
[thuds, groans]

03:55.236 --> 03:56.501
- [wind howling]

03:56.503 --> 03:58.670
- Hey! Doors
closed, maggots.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.706
You're lettin' in
all the riffraff.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.474
- Principal Bradford, how come
you look so put together?

04:02.476 --> 04:04.743
- Yeah, why don't you look
all messed up from the wind?

04:04.745 --> 04:07.112
- [laughs] It's probably
because he lives here.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.280
- STUDENTS:
[laughing]

04:08.282 --> 04:10.349
- I say now. Oh, come on.
I don't live here.

04:10.351 --> 04:15.520
I live at one, two, uh,
three school street.

04:15.522 --> 04:16.355
[laughing]

04:16.357 --> 04:18.156
Phoebe has tree hair!

04:18.158 --> 04:20.525
- WOLFGANG:
[laughing]

04:20.527 --> 04:22.261
- [school bell rings]

04:22.263 --> 04:23.662
- Right. I look ridiculous.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.631
I should have just
stayed home.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.565
- We all should have.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.267
And it's supposed
to be windy all week.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.135
We're gonna have to
keep coming back here

04:30.137 --> 04:31.670
because of
Heinrich Stupidville.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.239
- Unless we can find proof
that story's fake.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.340
Follow me to
the library.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.876
- Yeah, right, I'll go to
the library when pigs fly.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.279
- [pig squealing]

04:40.281 --> 04:42.314
- Okay, whose pig is that?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.216
- Let's go!

04:44.618 --> 04:46.718
All these books on
the history of Hiddenville

04:46.720 --> 04:49.154
and they all tell the same
ridiculous Heinrich story.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.156
At least we got
to hang at the libe.

04:51.158 --> 04:55.127
- Never ever call
a library "the libe."

04:55.129 --> 04:58.363
- [wind howling]

04:58.365 --> 05:00.565
- NORA:
[sighs]

05:00.567 --> 05:01.700
That was crazy.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.302
The wind tossed
Billy into a tree.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.337
- [laughs] Phoebe
got tossed in a tree, too.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.438
- MAX & NORA:
[laugh]

05:06.440 --> 05:09.141
- ¶ Ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah ¶

05:09.143 --> 05:10.842
- It sounds like
Blobbin's back.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.345
- [wind howling]

05:13.681 --> 05:15.580
- Hi-ya, ThunderMateys.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.182
- Going on a big trip--

05:17.184 --> 05:18.450
to a pirate convention?

05:18.452 --> 05:19.584
- [chuckling]

05:19.586 --> 05:21.420
I went back to the 1700s,

05:21.422 --> 05:24.323
and sailed the high
seas with Captain Blackbeard.

05:24.325 --> 05:24.890
- The 1700s?

05:24.892 --> 05:27.726
- Is that oversized refrigerator
in the driveway a time machine?

05:27.728 --> 05:28.794
- Indeedy, doozers.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.196
But I call it a timeshare
because I share it

05:31.198 --> 05:34.333
with a certain billionaire
whose name rhymes with...

05:34.335 --> 05:37.336
Poprah Shwinfrey.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.939
- He's talking about
Taylor Swift.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.742
- Anyway...
[chuckles]

05:43.744 --> 05:45.177
Arrrrg your
parents home?

05:45.179 --> 05:47.579
- Oh, probably still trying
to give Colosso a bath.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.880
- Ah...
[sniffing]

05:48.882 --> 05:51.350
I could probably
use one, too.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.218
Oh, Hank!

05:53.387 --> 05:55.620
- Guys, this is perfect.
We have a time machine.

05:55.622 --> 06:00.292
- We can go back to 1776
and ride dinosaurs.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.861
- No. We can go
back in time

06:02.863 --> 06:04.763
and prove that that
Heinrich story's a lie.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.498
Then no parent
could ever use it

06:06.500 --> 06:08.367
to make a kid go
to school again.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.101
- Are you crazy, Max?

06:09.103 --> 06:11.236
Time travel isn't something
you just toy with.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.504
- We're not gonna
toy with it.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.907
We're just gonna...
fuss with it a little.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.910
But, hey, you do
what you want.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.279
- [wind howling]

06:24.518 --> 06:25.784
- Oh, Phoebe.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.652
W-W-A-E-D.

06:27.654 --> 06:30.789
What Would
Albert Einstein Do?

06:30.791 --> 06:31.757
Wait up!

06:31.759 --> 06:34.559
- [wind howling]

06:35.262 --> 06:36.895
- MAX: To the 1950s!
- [electrical zapping]

06:36.897 --> 06:39.931
- MAX:
Here we go-o-o-o-o-o!

06:42.403 --> 06:43.034
- [door creaking]

06:43.036 --> 06:46.338
- Did it work?
Are we in 1955?

06:47.341 --> 06:49.508
- It smells like hair
grease and milkshakes,

06:49.510 --> 06:51.510
so, I'm gonna say yes.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.280

07:28.849 --> 07:32.684
- ['50s rock 'n roll]

07:32.686 --> 07:34.786
- I can't believe
we traveled back in time.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.421
- [lasers zapping]
- Ow!

07:36.423 --> 07:37.189
What'd you do that for?

07:37.191 --> 07:40.826
- I just wanted to make sure
my lasers still work in 1955.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.694
- We have to hide
the timeshare

07:42.696 --> 07:45.464
before we start
looking for Heinrich.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.433
- There's a button here
that says "camouflage."

07:48.435 --> 07:50.635
[presses button]

07:52.072 --> 07:54.573
- Hey, where did it go?

07:54.575 --> 07:56.641
[thuds]
Oh!

07:58.412 --> 07:59.945
Found it.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.414
- Way to go, SuperZero!

08:02.416 --> 08:03.582
- Colosso,
what are you doing here?

08:03.584 --> 08:07.519
- I jumped in your camper
before you went back in time.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.921
I do not like baths.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.457
- Stay here until
we're ready to go.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.458
- Will do...

08:13.460 --> 08:14.693
something different!

08:14.695 --> 08:17.128
See ya, suckers!
[laughing]

08:17.130 --> 08:18.730
- Well, that's not good.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.599
- We'll deal with
him later.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.033
[gasps]
I think that's Heinrich.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.436
He looks just like
the kid in the picture.

08:24.438 --> 08:25.604
- Gosh, that's
a pretty flower.

08:25.606 --> 08:29.508
I shall smell it, then record
it in my flower journal.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.175
- [laughing]

08:30.177 --> 08:33.044
Okay, there's no way that
kid fights off a bear.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.746
- Well, we're about
to find out.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.448
Look!

08:36.450 --> 08:38.683
- KIDS:
[screaming]

08:38.685 --> 08:40.018
- Okay, the big, scary
bear part checked out,

08:40.020 --> 08:43.188
But there's no way he's gonna
fight it off with a pencil.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.490
- [bear growling]

08:45.492 --> 08:46.625
- Listen here, Mr. Bear,

08:46.627 --> 08:49.661
you can't stand in
the way of my education.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.004
- What the what?

08:59.006 --> 09:00.171
The story's true.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.041
- I wonder what else Mom
and Dad were right about?

09:03.043 --> 09:06.044
Should I be wearing
underwear?

09:06.213 --> 09:10.148
- Wait, it's not too late
to make them wrong about this.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.182
What if we...

09:11.184 --> 09:12.951
stop Heinrich from
getting to school?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.052
- Whoa, whoa, Max.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.620
It's one thing
to toy with time.

09:15.622 --> 09:17.222
Now you wanna
toy with attendance?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.990
- Phoebe, if we stop him
from going to school,

09:18.992 --> 09:20.792
parents won't be able to
tell the story anymore.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.794
- We freeze him and when
he thaws out later,

09:22.796 --> 09:24.629
he'll have missed
the whole day.

09:24.631 --> 09:25.363
How hard could it be?

09:25.365 --> 09:27.165
- I hate it when you say
"how hard could it be?"

09:27.167 --> 09:30.068
- Yeah, how hard could it be?
- How hard could it be?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.670
- Everyone, stop it!

09:31.672 --> 09:34.673
- Come on, before
he gets away.

09:34.942 --> 09:35.840
- [frosty air gusting]

09:35.842 --> 09:37.542
- Great Scott!
What was that?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.678
- Shoot, missed!
Billy, block him!

09:39.680 --> 09:40.779
- [zooming]

09:40.781 --> 09:41.379
- Gee willikers!

09:41.381 --> 09:44.516
I'm being accosted
by supervillains.

09:44.518 --> 09:45.550
- [zooming]

09:45.552 --> 09:48.086
We're not supervillains.
We're superheroes.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.656
- I'm being accosted
by superheroes.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.191
- We're just trying
to skip school

09:53.193 --> 09:55.126
on a windy day
60 years from now.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.195
Stand still!
[lasers zapping]

09:57.197 --> 09:59.731
- You...you stay
away from me,

09:59.733 --> 10:02.200
you no-goodnicks!

10:02.869 --> 10:05.036
Ow! My leg!

10:05.038 --> 10:09.207
Because of you monsters,
I'm gonna miss school.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.977
- Well, you heard him.
Our work here is done.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.245
- I'm gonna miss
the sock hop.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.748
What will I write
in my dance journal?

10:16.750 --> 10:20.285
- We can't just leave
him here, guys.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.987
Guys?

10:23.256 --> 10:24.990
Wait up!

10:28.028 --> 10:31.596
- [electrical zapping]

10:31.598 --> 10:35.266
- ¶

10:35.268 --> 10:37.569
- Hey, the wind is gone.

10:37.571 --> 10:38.169
- Even better---

10:38.171 --> 10:41.806
Mom and Dad will never tell
us that annoying story again.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.343
- Something's different.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.013
- It's the lamp,
isn't it?

10:48.015 --> 10:50.115
- Where are
Mom and Dad?

10:50.117 --> 10:51.616
Are we in the wrong house?

10:51.618 --> 10:55.854
- Are you part of the Puking
Scorpions Biker Gang?

10:55.856 --> 10:57.088
- KIDS:
No.

10:57.090 --> 11:01.926
- Then you are definitely
in the wrong house.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.029
- Let me smack
'em, Daddy!

11:04.031 --> 11:06.364
- Whoa, there's a mistake.
We live here.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.000
Look at our
family portrait.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.338
Which is now you
guys getting arrested.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.641
- He's making fun of
our vacation picture!

11:16.643 --> 11:17.642
Get 'em!
- Yeah!

11:17.644 --> 11:19.177
- PHOEBE: It's clear
what's happening here!

11:19.179 --> 11:21.179
- MAX: When we went back
in time, we changed history?

11:21.181 --> 11:24.349
- Yes, and they're gonna
hurt us, so go right now!

11:28.789 --> 11:30.889
All right, Billy and Nora
are safe in the timeshare.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.191
Let's find out exactly
how we changed things.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.060
Wow, look at our school.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.761
- This place is a dump.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.763
Evil Max would
have loved it.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.065
- Hey, you!

11:40.067 --> 11:45.036
Give up the lunch money
and nobody gets hurt.

11:45.038 --> 11:45.804
- She's lying!

11:45.806 --> 11:49.040
Either way, we're gonna
pound you into next week.

11:49.710 --> 11:53.344
- Uh, Gideon, Cherry,
it's me, Phoebe.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.914
- We don't know you.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.817
- Yeah, gimme your
lunch money!

11:58.819 --> 12:00.852
And your number.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.755
- [laughing]

12:03.757 --> 12:08.026
I'm sorry, he's just so
adorable when he's being tough.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.395
- Is this adorable?
- Oh!

12:10.397 --> 12:11.329
Yeah. A little.

12:11.331 --> 12:15.100
- [shrill whistle]

12:15.102 --> 12:16.234
- Wolfen Pack!

12:16.236 --> 12:19.237
[howling]

12:19.239 --> 12:20.438
- We'd better go.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.207
- You got off easy
this time, losers!

12:22.209 --> 12:24.709
[stamps foot]
- Ow!

12:24.711 --> 12:28.246
Why aren't they
hurting you?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.881
- Hey, Bradford.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.449
- The name's Bad Chad.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.350
What the heck
do you want?

12:32.352 --> 12:34.786
- We're just trying to know
what happened to Hiddenville.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.421
- Yeah, didn't Heinrich
Hiddenville III

12:36.423 --> 12:38.690
become mayor and make
the town awesome?

12:38.692 --> 12:40.024
- Heinrich Hiddenville III?

12:40.026 --> 12:43.928
You mean King Heinie,
the crime boss?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.697
- He's a crime boss?

12:45.699 --> 12:47.899
Named King Heinie?

12:47.901 --> 12:50.135
- Everyone knows
the story of King Heinie.

12:50.137 --> 12:54.405
Four superheroes attacked him
and he missed his dance contest.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.874
His hatred of superheroes

12:55.876 --> 12:58.409
drove him to
an amazing life of crime.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.145
- Been there.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.881
- Heinrich grew up to
become a powerful crime boss

13:02.883 --> 13:04.249
and took over Hiddenville.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.918
He banished all
superheroes.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.019
And bears.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.455
He is one angry Heinie.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.158
- That's why the town
filled up with criminals.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.225
- It sure did.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.894
Including me.
- My purse!

13:15.896 --> 13:18.363
- [mockingly]
My purse now. Hee-hee.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.332
- Oh, now I see why Mom
and Dad weren't in the house.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.801
They never moved here.

13:22.803 --> 13:23.535
- This is all our fault.

13:23.537 --> 13:26.171
I just wanted Mom and Dad
to stop telling that story.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.238
We have to go back in time

13:27.240 --> 13:29.140
and stop ourselves
from hurting Heinrich.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.308
- Phoebe, we can't do that.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.843
If we see ourselves
in the past,

13:31.845 --> 13:34.045
the whole universe
could close in on itself.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.413
Watch a movie,
ya bookworm!

13:35.415 --> 13:37.916
- Okay, then, let's go
back later in the day

13:37.918 --> 13:39.184
and talk to King Heinie.

13:39.186 --> 13:42.320
[laughing]
That name is so fun to say.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.924
- Maybe if we can help
him win the dance contest,

13:45.926 --> 13:46.791
he won't hate superheroes

13:46.793 --> 13:48.459
and everything
will go back to normal.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.094
- Okay, great.
Let's do that.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.930
And find some shoes.
- Why?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.932
- Someone stole ours.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.134
- So nice!

13:58.805 --> 14:00.805
- [electrical zapping]

14:00.807 --> 14:02.207
- [door creaking]

14:02.209 --> 14:04.042
- Okay, we're back
in the '50s.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.777
- NORA: First step,
find Heinrich.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.212
- There he is.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.080
- Well, that first
step was easy.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.383
Now all we have to do is get
him to win a dance contest.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.985
How hard could it be?

14:13.987 --> 14:16.821
- [bicycle bell ringing]

14:16.990 --> 14:20.158
- Stop saying
"How hard could it be?"

14:23.964 --> 14:25.296
- If the dweeb's
leg is broken,

14:25.298 --> 14:26.965
how are we gonna
fix the future?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.132
- We'll figure
something out.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.968
Now Heinrich is probably
gonna be scared

14:29.970 --> 14:31.502
when he sees us,
so nobody--

14:31.504 --> 14:32.871
Where's Billy?

14:32.873 --> 14:34.973
- Yo, Heinrich.
Remember me?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.941
- [screams]

14:37.477 --> 14:39.110
- MAX: Hey, buddy!
Chill out!

14:39.112 --> 14:41.246
We're here to help.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.480
- Chill out?

14:42.482 --> 14:43.815
Is that superhero wordplay

14:43.817 --> 14:46.351
because of your
ice mouth powers?

14:46.353 --> 14:48.853
- We came back
to say sorry.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.355
- You're not
gonna hurt me?

14:50.357 --> 14:51.890
Not that you could
do any more damage.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.459
You've already ruined
my perfect attendance.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.361
- Whew. Been there.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.963
- And then my partner
for the dance contest

14:58.965 --> 15:00.398
dropped me like
a hot potato.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.500
- It's just
a dance contest.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.370
What matters is that
you're a winner...

15:05.372 --> 15:07.071
here.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.908
- He doesn't speak
for all of us.

15:09.910 --> 15:13.011
- I wanted to win that contest
so I could become popular.

15:13.013 --> 15:16.247
In fact, who knows? Maybe
I could become class president.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.148
- You could be mayor.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.884
- That'll never happen now,
thanks to you guys.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.920
- What did we do?

15:23.123 --> 15:26.024
- I'm gonna talk to
you three from now on.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.259
- Look, Heinrich,
let us use our powers

15:28.261 --> 15:29.861
to help you win
the dance contest.

15:29.863 --> 15:31.396
- Yeah, I could be
your partner.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.031
- Do you even
know how to dance?

15:33.033 --> 15:34.966
- [laughing]
Do I know how to dance?

15:34.968 --> 15:38.503
They don't call me "Crazy Legs"
Thunderman for nothing.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.139
¶ Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha ¶

15:41.141 --> 15:42.240

15:42.242 --> 15:44.409
¶ Ah poot doo hoo hoo ¶

- Oh!

15:51.418 --> 15:53.051
- Huh? Huh?

15:53.053 --> 15:56.054
- Great. So we all agree
we're gonna hire a stranger

15:56.056 --> 15:57.889
to be Heinrich's
dance partner.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.458
- No, I wanna dance
with Crazy Legs.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.459
She's the bee's knees.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.195
- Hear that? So, are you
on the boogie bus or not?

16:04.197 --> 16:05.363
- [groaning]
Do I have to say--

16:05.365 --> 16:08.399
- Yes, you have to
say "boogie bus."

16:09.202 --> 16:11.536
- I'm on the boogie bus!
- Woohoo!

why's it called Splatburger?

- Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

16:28.188 --> 16:30.521
- Oh, the people go splat.

16:31.358 --> 16:34.092
- Hey, that must be
Mrs. Wong's grandmother.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.327
- I wonder if she's
nicer than our Wong?

16:36.329 --> 16:40.365
- You're fired,
you rollerdummy!

16:40.367 --> 16:42.533
- Nope, same genes.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.635
- Move aside, maggots!

16:44.637 --> 16:47.238
- Whoa, that guy
looks like Bradford.

- It is Bradford.

Colonel Chad Bradford,

16:50.043 --> 16:52.377
- Looks like jerk
runs in the family.

- Listen up.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.613
The dance contest
is about to commence.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.516
Miss Wong will judge
all who participate

16:58.518 --> 17:02.387
because she
is my best gal.

- Mmmmmm...

17:11.131 --> 17:13.698
- Someone remind me
to throw up later.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.001
- Miss Wong,
the floor is yours.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.370
- Ooohhhh...

take your places
on the dance floor.

can I do to help?

with that.

the crutches, Heinrich.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.746
- Yeah, that's definitely
what happened.

18:02.348 --> 18:06.317
- Sit down. This is a sock hop,
not a suck hop.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.352
[cackling]

18:08.354 --> 18:11.055
Three couples left.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.724
- Hey, twitchy kid.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.560
What is with the moptop?

18:15.562 --> 18:20.164
You need to grease that hair
down like a gentleman.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.034
Now fall in, son.

18:23.036 --> 18:24.268
- Help!

18:24.270 --> 18:25.603
- Oh! Max!

18:25.605 --> 18:27.105
- Pardon my language,

18:27.107 --> 18:29.373
but this is a real
party pooper.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.343
- No slow dancing.
- Sorry.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.711
Where is Max?

18:33.713 --> 18:37.315
- Phoebe, Bradford's trying to
take out my swoosh, my swoosh!

18:37.317 --> 18:39.217
- Max, you need
to decide--

18:39.219 --> 18:41.085
your hair
or Hiddenville's future.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.621
- Am I a jerk for
thinking about this?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.223
- Yes!

18:45.225 --> 18:46.824
- Hey, you looking for me?

18:46.826 --> 18:48.459
- Yes, I was.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.828
Sit down, Private!

18:52.365 --> 18:52.830
- Oh.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.566
- [grease splooshing]
- [groaning]

18:58.238 --> 19:00.438
- Hot diggity-dog,
we're back in business.

19:00.440 --> 19:04.242
- Uh, excuse me,
can I interest you in...

19:04.244 --> 19:06.310
getting lost!

19:06.312 --> 19:10.081
- ¶

19:10.083 --> 19:12.250
- That last couple's
gonna be tough to beat.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.253
We've gotta get on
board the boogie bus.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.354
- Buckle up, Heinie,

19:16.356 --> 19:19.223
Max, turn up
all the way.

19:19.225 --> 19:30.201
- ¶

19:30.203 --> 19:32.270
- CROWD:
[cheering]

19:32.272 --> 19:33.804
- ¶

19:33.806 --> 19:35.406
- MISS WONG:
I have seen enough!

19:35.408 --> 19:38.843
Your moves are so
new and different.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.146
I hate them!
You lose! They win!

19:42.148 --> 19:43.648
- Woo!

19:43.650 --> 19:46.684
- [flashbulb pops]

19:46.686 --> 19:48.286
- I'm back with Billy.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.555
- I got hit by
a milk truck.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.623
- So, did we win?
- No, we lost.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.126
- Does that mean we have
to go back to Crimeville?

19:55.128 --> 19:59.230
- I let this happen
to my hair for nothing?

19:59.232 --> 20:02.166
- Heinrich is gonna
be devastated.

20:02.168 --> 20:04.769
- This is the best
night ever.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.270
- How oddly cheery.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.705
- Thanks, guys.
Everyone loved our dance.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.474
Look, they're all doing
"The Heinrich."

20:11.844 --> 20:13.844
- Heinrich, this new
dance is a gas.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.746
You should run
for class president.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.315
- You'd have my vote.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.850
- I'm sorry, did she just
hit on my dance partner

20:19.852 --> 20:21.652
like I wasn't even here?

20:21.654 --> 20:22.687
- Phoebe, let it go.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.589
We fixed the future.
Now let's go home.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.856
- Wait, before you go.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.191
It would be swell if you

20:27.193 --> 20:29.894
took a picture with me
to remember you by.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.196
- [flashbulb pops]

20:32.198 --> 20:34.298
- Later, 'gators.
- Bye.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.866
- Guys, can we please
leave now?

20:35.868 --> 20:39.303
Grandma Wong and Colonel
Bradford are slow dancing.

20:39.305 --> 20:42.607
- Mmmmmm...
- Mmmmmm...

20:43.710 --> 20:47.211
- Remember when I said
to remind me to barf?

20:47.213 --> 20:49.680
You don't need to.

20:51.317 --> 20:52.883
- [electrical zapping]

20:52.885 --> 20:55.853
- [wind howling]

20:55.855 --> 20:58.623
- Did it work?
Is everything fixed?

20:58.625 --> 20:59.624
- [pig squealing]

20:59.626 --> 21:02.260
- Well, that's
a good sign.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.231
- Mom!
- Mom!

21:07.233 --> 21:08.633
- Mom!
- BARB: Oh!

21:08.635 --> 21:10.268
Why are you guys
all dressed up?

21:10.270 --> 21:14.972
- Oh? Um, we are becoming
an old-time family band.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.540
- Oh, can I join?

21:16.542 --> 21:18.242
- We just broke up.

21:18.244 --> 21:20.678
- You kids went to
school in this wind?

21:20.680 --> 21:24.215
- They did and I'll
tell you why.

21:24.217 --> 21:26.317
Our mayor,
Heinrich Hiddenville III

21:26.319 --> 21:27.551
never missed
a day of school.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.954
- Oh, except for that one
time he fought a bear

21:29.956 --> 21:31.656
and tripped over a rock.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.824
- Even then, he competed
in a dance contest

21:33.826 --> 21:35.326
and won over
the whole town.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.528
Now he lost because
of his partner,

21:37.530 --> 21:41.265
who history has
since forgotten.

21:41.267 --> 21:44.535
- I heard she was
the bee's knees.

21:44.537 --> 21:49.273
- CHLOE: Those guys
look like you guys.

21:49.275 --> 21:52.376
- Did you kids
use my timeshare?

21:52.378 --> 21:55.379
- No.
- No.

21:55.381 --> 21:57.748
- Oh, really?

21:57.750 --> 22:01.952
You left me in 1955.

22:01.954 --> 22:06.357
- I knew we forgot
something.

22:10.330 --> 22:26.610
- ¶
