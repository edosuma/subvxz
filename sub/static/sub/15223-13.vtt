( <i>bells pealing</i> )

01:07.901 --> 01:10.400
So, what are you and Suzanne
doing for Christmas, John?

01:10.434 --> 01:12.534
Oh, her parents
are having a party.

01:12.567 --> 01:13.667
How about you?

01:13.701 --> 01:15.000
Oh, I don't know.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.834
Last year, I went
to a sit-down dinner

01:16.868 --> 01:17.834
for 80 people.

01:17.868 --> 01:19.968
80 People. Wow!

01:20.000 --> 01:22.567
Yeah, they got this
really long counter

01:22.601 --> 01:23.634
at Woolworth's.

01:24.667 --> 01:25.934
Merry
Christmas,
Elaine.

01:25.968 --> 01:27.734
Hey, how
you doing, Elaine?

01:27.767 --> 01:29.267
Come on.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.501
I'll take three.

01:30.534 --> 01:32.734
What's the matter with Elaine?

01:32.767 --> 01:35.968
Oh, I think it has something
to do with her ex-husband

01:36.000 --> 01:37.934
picks up the girls this morning.

01:37.968 --> 01:40.968
This is the first Christmas
she's ever spent alone.

01:41.000 --> 01:41.667
Poor thing.

01:41.701 --> 01:42.834
What a bummer.

01:42.868 --> 01:45.400
I'd go crazy if I had
to spend Christmas alone.

01:45.434 --> 01:47.100
You <i>are</i> spending
Christmas alone.

01:47.133 --> 01:48.334
I am?

01:51.133 --> 01:53.167
Well, he gave us
fair warning.

01:54.634 --> 01:57.434
$35? You call this
a day's booking?

01:57.467 --> 01:59.000
Sorry, Louie.

02:00.567 --> 02:02.567
What's
the matter
with her?

02:02.601 --> 02:04.834
You wouldn't
understand, Louie.

02:04.868 --> 02:08.067
Some people just feel
sad at Christmas.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.133
Oh, yeah?
You think I don't know that?

02:10.167 --> 02:11.267
I got feelings.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.567
Really?

02:12.601 --> 02:15.434
My mother's that way.

02:15.467 --> 02:16.834
Cries every
Christmas

02:16.868 --> 02:19.400
on account of my
little brother Nicky

02:19.434 --> 02:21.033
never comes
to see her.

02:21.067 --> 02:23.467
I'll give you
the same advice

02:23.501 --> 02:25.901
I give my mom
when she cries.

02:25.934 --> 02:29.400
I say, "Ma, shut up."

02:31.133 --> 02:33.100
I always knew you
could be tender.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.334
Yeah, only this year,

02:34.367 --> 02:36.400
I ain't going to have
any problems with Ma

02:36.434 --> 02:38.834
because Nicky's
breaking with tradition.

02:38.868 --> 02:40.067
Oh, you mean
your brother is
coming to town?

02:40.100 --> 02:41.267
Due in today.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.334
I'm expecting
him any minute.

02:43.367 --> 02:44.901
I told you
about him.

02:44.934 --> 02:46.400
Big-time
poker player,

02:46.434 --> 02:47.767
lives in
Las Vegas.

02:47.801 --> 02:48.767
Yeah, right.

02:48.801 --> 02:51.367
Always says
he's too busy
to come East.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.567
Only this year
he was in
Atlantic City

02:53.601 --> 02:54.934
to catch
the action.

02:54.968 --> 02:58.000
I talked him
into stopping by
for a few days.

02:58.033 --> 03:03.200
You know, every Christmas
Eve for the past six years

03:03.234 --> 03:06.334
Ma stayed up all night crying.

03:06.367 --> 03:08.167
It was really hard on me.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.634
I'll bet.

03:09.667 --> 03:13.467
Yeah, I hated having
to put her out in the hall.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.033
Nick!

03:19.067 --> 03:20.133
Louie!

03:20.167 --> 03:22.200
You made it, Nick!

03:28.901 --> 03:30.234
My little brother.

03:30.267 --> 03:34.467
Hey, everybody, this is
my little brother, Nicky.

03:34.501 --> 03:37.567
Ooh, I can't believe
you're here.

03:37.601 --> 03:40.200
Come here. I want
to introduce you

03:40.234 --> 03:42.067
to some of
my inferiors.

03:42.100 --> 03:44.000
Nah, we'll
do that later.

03:44.033 --> 03:46.400
Six years I haven't seen you.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.000
Let me look at you.

03:48.901 --> 03:50.133
New coat, huh?

03:51.567 --> 03:52.767
Ma can't wait
to see you.

03:52.801 --> 03:54.667
She couldn't talk
about anything else

03:54.701 --> 03:56.534
since she found out
you were coming.

03:56.567 --> 03:57.534
Right.

03:57.567 --> 03:59.334
Hey, is that
a poker game?

03:59.367 --> 04:01.667
Relax. I already told
them you're a pro.

04:01.701 --> 04:03.167
Now, listen,

04:03.200 --> 04:06.601
the sleeping arrangements
are going to be a little tricky

04:06.634 --> 04:08.834
because, you see,
we only have two beds,

04:08.868 --> 04:11.067
but Ma has trouble
sleeping anyway,

04:11.100 --> 04:13.634
so she can sit up
and you can have hers.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.399
Nicky, we're going to
have such a good time.

04:16.434 --> 04:17.834
Right, right, right.

04:17.868 --> 04:19.601
How about me sitting in
on a few hands, huh?

04:19.634 --> 04:21.968
Hey, Nick, Nicky, don't you hear
what I'm saying?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.200
Nicky, Ma's been waiting
to see you for six years.

04:24.234 --> 04:26.367
So, she can wait
a few minutes.
It won't hurt her.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.200
I ain't fooling
with you this
time, Nicky.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.200
Get up there.

04:29.234 --> 04:30.133
Hey, Jeff, get a cab

04:30.167 --> 04:31.868
and take my brother
to see my mother.

04:31.901 --> 04:33.133
Come on, Louie.
Don't push.

04:33.167 --> 04:34.634
I'm not pushing.
Now, get the hell out of here!

04:34.667 --> 04:36.100
I'm going,
I'm going.

04:36.133 --> 04:39.400
Just don't
lose all that
Christmas tip money.

04:39.434 --> 04:40.834
I want a crack at it.

04:48.968 --> 04:50.801
I know it's none of my business,
Louie, but, uh,

04:50.834 --> 04:53.167
your brother didn't seem so
anxious to visit your mother.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.767
I know.

04:56.801 --> 04:59.067
It worries me, Alex.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.701
He hurts her bad.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.834
Huh?

05:01.868 --> 05:04.634
He never shows
her any affection

05:04.667 --> 05:06.167
or consideration.

05:06.200 --> 05:10.200
Like me, I'm always saying
stuff like, "How you doing, Ma?"

05:10.234 --> 05:11.234
You know?

05:11.267 --> 05:12.567
She cooks
something,

05:12.601 --> 05:15.133
and I don't like
the way it tastes,

05:15.167 --> 05:16.734
I never spit it out.

05:16.767 --> 05:20.834
I always tell her,
"Take another crack at it."

05:20.868 --> 05:23.701
But listen,
I want to tell
you something.

05:23.734 --> 05:25.968
This is
just between
you and me.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.701
The winters have
been getting

05:27.734 --> 05:28.801
really hard on Ma,

05:28.834 --> 05:30.634
and she freezes up on me,

05:30.667 --> 05:32.167
Oh.
you know?

05:32.200 --> 05:34.501
And she needs to go someplace

05:34.534 --> 05:37.200
where it's warm
so she can thaw out.

05:37.234 --> 05:39.167
You know, like Las Vegas.

05:39.200 --> 05:39.934
Yeah.

05:39.968 --> 05:41.200
Now, here's Nick--

05:41.234 --> 05:43.767
he's got this beautiful
apartment out there.

05:43.801 --> 05:47.133
You think he ever asked her once
to come out and visit?

05:47.167 --> 05:48.133
No.

05:48.167 --> 05:49.501
Now, what I'm hoping is

05:49.534 --> 05:52.367
he's going to go home and
see how bad off she is

05:52.400 --> 05:54.868
and then get the idea
himself and ask her.

05:54.901 --> 05:56.767
That'd be swell,
but from what I saw,

05:56.801 --> 05:58.400
I wouldn't count on it, Louie.

05:58.434 --> 06:00.634
No, I'm not, I'm not.

06:00.667 --> 06:05.000
That's why I told Ma, you know,
drop a few subtle hints.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.200
Now that'd be an idea.

06:06.234 --> 06:08.667
Yeah, like I told her
to tell him,

06:08.701 --> 06:12.534
"Nicky, I'd really love to
see your apartment in Vegas

06:12.567 --> 06:14.033
"before I die,

06:14.067 --> 06:18.033
because if I don't I'll put
a curse on you from my grave."

06:18.067 --> 06:22.434
* Joy to the world,
the Lord is come *

06:22.467 --> 06:24.968
* let Earth receive
her King... *

06:25.000 --> 06:26.200
Look
at this.

06:26.234 --> 06:30.567
* Let every heart
prepare Him room *

06:30.601 --> 06:32.434
* And heaven and nature sing 

06:32.467 --> 06:34.334
* and heaven and nature sing 

06:34.367 --> 06:38.901
* And heaven and
nature sing... *

06:38.934 --> 06:41.934
Come on, give him
a buck, everybody.

06:41.968 --> 06:46.200
* Let Earth receive her King 

06:46.234 --> 06:49.968
* Let every heart
prepare Him room *

06:50.000 --> 06:51.501
* And heaven and nature sing 

06:51.534 --> 06:53.534
* And heaven and nature sing 

06:53.567 --> 06:57.701
* And heaven and nature sing 

06:57.734 --> 06:59.267
* Joy to the world... 

06:59.300 --> 07:01.234
Here's your cut,
Mr. De Palma.

07:01.267 --> 07:03.701
Thanks for letting us
work the garage.

07:03.734 --> 07:05.234
Okay, Merry
Christmas.

07:05.267 --> 07:07.367
All right, now
keep practicing

07:07.400 --> 07:11.033
because I might
have a New Year's
eve gig for you.

07:12.567 --> 07:13.868
Hey, I was
just thinking.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.167
Why don't we
have a little
Christmas party?

07:16.200 --> 07:17.267
Where?

07:17.300 --> 07:18.868
Right here
in the garage.

07:18.901 --> 07:20.000
You know,
why not?

07:20.033 --> 07:21.634
We never had
one here before.

07:21.667 --> 07:22.767
How come?

07:22.801 --> 07:24.534
I don't know... tradition?

07:24.567 --> 07:25.501
Hey, wait a minute.

07:25.534 --> 07:27.200
That might not be
such a bad idea.

07:27.234 --> 07:28.667
Sure.

07:28.701 --> 07:29.601
I can make some egg nog.

07:29.634 --> 07:30.868
I'm not going
to be able to cook

07:30.901 --> 07:31.968
but I could stop at a deli.

07:32.000 --> 07:32.968
That's fine,
that's fine.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.400
I'll get some Christmas
decorations.

07:34.434 --> 07:35.801
Right.

07:35.834 --> 07:38.267
I'm sure even Louie will
give me a break on the choir.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.334
And you know what?

07:39.367 --> 07:40.767
I'm going to get
a Christmas tree

07:40.801 --> 07:42.968
so we can put all of
our gifts underneath it.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I just hope you guys
like what I got you.

07:46.968 --> 07:48.033
What's wrong?

07:48.067 --> 07:50.167
You do exchange
Christmas gifts, don't you?

07:50.200 --> 07:51.234
We do now.

07:51.267 --> 07:52.467
Yeah, sure.

07:52.501 --> 07:54.300
ELAINE:
Okay, well, I'm going
to make some phone calls

07:54.334 --> 07:55.300
and I'll set it up.

07:55.334 --> 07:56.601
Okay, everybody, okay.

07:56.634 --> 07:58.734
Come here round the table.
Let's go.

07:58.767 --> 08:01.167
Who's the cashier
around this joint, huh?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.501
LOUIE:
Nick!

08:02.534 --> 08:04.968
What are you doing back here?
You're supposed to be seeing Ma.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.934
I saw Ma--
we had a little chat.

08:06.968 --> 08:08.934
You had a good idea me coming.

08:08.968 --> 08:10.133
I'm glad I did it.

08:10.167 --> 08:11.434
Hey, deal me in.

08:11.467 --> 08:12.367
Don't deal
him in.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.100
You only been
gone ten minutes.

08:14.133 --> 08:16.601
It takes ten minutes
to drive there and back.

08:16.634 --> 08:18.634
What'd you expect,
me to spend all afternoon
with her? Deal me in.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.834
Don't deal him in.
I want to talk to you.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.267
I got a poker game
to play, Louie.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.968
I want to talk to you now.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.167
Get in the cage.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.601
Excuse us.

08:27.634 --> 08:28.634
Get in there.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.100
Watch my
coat, huh?

08:30.133 --> 08:32.200
I'll watch
the coat.

08:32.234 --> 08:33.366
Sit down.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.033
You're a rotten
kid, Nick.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.634
Six years
you're gone.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.100
You don't call,
you don't write.

08:41.133 --> 08:42.299
Nothing.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.567
You come back for
a crummy five minutes.

08:44.601 --> 08:46.701
Ain't you got no feelings
for Ma at all?

08:46.734 --> 08:47.968
( <i>phone rings</i> )

08:48.000 --> 08:49.968
Sunshine cab.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.868
Hey, crazy lady,
give me a break here.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.300
It's Ma.

08:55.334 --> 08:59.000
I'm talking
to him now.

08:59.033 --> 09:00.234
What?

09:00.267 --> 09:02.934
She says she asked you
about going to Vegas

09:02.968 --> 09:04.734
and you laughed in her face.

09:04.767 --> 09:05.901
I thought she was joking.

09:05.934 --> 09:07.801
What am I going to do
with Ma in Las Vegas?

09:07.834 --> 09:09.667
Stop screaming, will you?!

09:09.701 --> 09:12.601
I can't talk to her
when she's like this.

09:12.634 --> 09:15.901
Ma, I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

09:15.934 --> 09:19.267
Alex, come in here
and talk to my mother.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.467
What, me?

09:20.501 --> 09:22.367
LOUIE:
Come on, just
take the phone.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.000
Hey, Louie, I don't know
what to say to your mother.

09:24.033 --> 09:26.334
You don't have to say
anything, just listen.

09:30.434 --> 09:32.534
Hello, Mrs. De Palma?

09:32.567 --> 09:35.534
This is Alex Rieger, one
of your son's employees.

09:37.400 --> 09:41.534
No, Mrs. De Palma, I don't
know why people have children.

09:41.567 --> 09:46.167
Look, Nick, I've given you
your way for a long time.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.834
I've been with Ma.

09:47.868 --> 09:49.667
I'm taking care of her.

09:49.701 --> 09:51.934
I never asked you for no help.

09:51.968 --> 09:53.234
Well, maybe I
haven't said so,

09:53.267 --> 09:55.100
but I always thought
that was big of you.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.434
Nicky was
a difficult birth, huh?

09:58.467 --> 09:59.667
No, no, please.

09:59.701 --> 10:02.334
Mrs. De Palma, don't tell
me all the medical details.

10:02.367 --> 10:04.300
I'm really not
a medical man, please.

10:04.334 --> 10:07.267
Look, you're taking Ma
to Vegas and that's that.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.267
I told you,
I can't.

10:08.300 --> 10:09.634
Give me one good reason.

10:09.667 --> 10:10.734
I don't want to.

10:10.767 --> 10:15.400
Nicky used to pull
the what off flies?

10:15.434 --> 10:17.801
All right, this is
your last chance.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.834
You either take Ma
with you when you go,

10:20.868 --> 10:23.601
or you leave town an only child.

10:23.634 --> 10:26.167
I'm not your brother anymore.

10:28.834 --> 10:31.033
Okay, Louie.

10:31.067 --> 10:32.901
Have it your way.

10:32.934 --> 10:35.133
We're not
brothers anymore.

10:37.467 --> 10:39.234
Hey, deal me in.

10:39.267 --> 10:40.767
You want
to talk
to Nicky?

10:40.801 --> 10:41.767
Nick.

10:41.801 --> 10:44.868
Louie, Louie,
I'm sorry.

10:44.901 --> 10:46.000
Ma!

10:46.033 --> 10:48.801
Ma, you're going
to Vegas, I promise.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.434
I'm not lying.

10:50.467 --> 10:53.200
Have I lied to you yet?

10:53.234 --> 10:56.667
I mean <i>this</i> phone call.

10:56.701 --> 10:58.501
No, trust me, then.

10:58.534 --> 11:01.534
I swear you're going to Vegas.

11:04.067 --> 11:06.267
How you going to keep a promise
like that?

11:06.300 --> 11:08.567
I don't know, Alex,
but I got to.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.801
You hear the way she screeches?

11:10.834 --> 11:16.901
Sometimes when she's going real
good, dogs come from all over.

11:16.934 --> 11:20.601
I just have to keep
that promise.

11:35.601 --> 11:37.133
Thanks for
coming, Alex.

11:37.167 --> 11:39.000
I knew I could
count on you if I called you.

11:39.033 --> 11:40.267
You're a real pal.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.267
Yeah.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.534
What are
you having?

11:42.567 --> 11:43.901
Um, I'll
have a beer.

11:43.934 --> 11:45.534
Separate tabs.

11:47.534 --> 11:49.834
So, how's the party going?

11:49.868 --> 11:51.534
Oh, you'd hate it, Louie.

11:51.567 --> 11:53.033
There's joy everywhere.

11:53.067 --> 11:55.167
Nick still around?

11:55.200 --> 11:57.067
Yep, and winning big.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.934
You know, I been doing a lot
of thinking, Alex,

12:02.968 --> 12:07.100
about Ma, about me,
about Nick, about Ma and me,

12:07.133 --> 12:10.667
about Nick and me,
about Nick and Ma.

12:10.701 --> 12:14.601
Thank goodness you don't
have a bigger family.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.200
You know, Christmas
has always been

12:16.234 --> 12:17.868
a stinking time
of the year for me.

12:17.901 --> 12:19.033
Oh, come on, Louie.

12:19.067 --> 12:20.100
Always!

12:20.133 --> 12:22.067
Do you know that
I played the elf

12:22.100 --> 12:24.367
in the Christmas
pageant every year

12:24.400 --> 12:26.033
till I left
for the Army?

12:26.067 --> 12:27.033
Yeah, I know.

12:27.067 --> 12:29.200
I never got to
play the parts

12:29.234 --> 12:30.834
that I wanted
to play--

12:30.868 --> 12:34.834
angel, shepherd,
room clerk...

12:35.968 --> 12:38.601
The guy who said,
"No room at the Inn."

12:38.634 --> 12:40.868
Oh, that room clerk.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.167
Alex, Louie.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.167
Hi, John.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
Excuse me.

12:45.234 --> 12:46.300
Listen, I was just
on my way

12:46.334 --> 12:48.334
to my in-laws' house
for the party

12:48.367 --> 12:49.801
and I wanted
to drop by

12:49.834 --> 12:51.834
and wish you
a Merry Christmas.

12:53.834 --> 12:55.567
Maybe this is
the wrong time.

12:55.601 --> 12:57.300
Huh? No, no,
it's okay, John.

12:57.334 --> 12:59.667
Hey, how did you do
at the poker table?

12:59.701 --> 13:01.167
Got cleaned out.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.033
Boy, that brother of yours
can really play poker.

13:03.067 --> 13:04.701
He's cleaning everybody.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.634
Yeah, I'm glad I'm not playing.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.067
That does it.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.667
It's bad enough he's ruining
Christmas for me and Ma.

13:10.701 --> 13:12.534
He's got to
ruin it for
everybody else.

13:12.567 --> 13:13.534
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:13.567 --> 13:15.234
I want to get
even with him.
I would too.

13:15.267 --> 13:17.400
I want to hit him
where it hurts the most.

13:17.434 --> 13:19.167
And I want you to help me.

13:19.200 --> 13:19.901
Me?

13:19.934 --> 13:21.033
Yeah. You're the best

13:21.067 --> 13:22.901
poker player in the company,
Alex.

13:22.934 --> 13:23.934
Well...

13:23.968 --> 13:25.234
I want you
to challenge Nick

13:25.267 --> 13:26.601
and beat him
at his own game.

13:26.634 --> 13:28.033
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

13:28.067 --> 13:29.601
Now, Nick's a pro.
I can't beat him.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.501
Even if I could,
it would take
a lot of money

13:31.534 --> 13:32.934
to bankroll
a challenge
like that.

13:32.968 --> 13:34.801
I got the money.

13:34.834 --> 13:36.133
It's my life savings.

13:36.167 --> 13:38.501
I been socking away
money for years.

13:38.534 --> 13:40.167
I've always wanted to use it

13:40.200 --> 13:41.567
for something special--

13:41.601 --> 13:44.434
a trip to Florida,
a new car...

13:44.467 --> 13:46.601
Revenge!

13:46.634 --> 13:48.601
I want him
wiped out, Alex

13:48.634 --> 13:53.868
crushed, destroyed,
humiliated...

13:53.901 --> 13:55.667
for Ma.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.467
Louie, what
do you think?

14:20.501 --> 14:21.901
About what?

14:22.901 --> 14:23.968
Nick.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.701
Hey, Louie, I knew

14:26.734 --> 14:29.501
you couldn't stay mad
at me forever.

14:29.534 --> 14:30.467
Great party.

14:30.501 --> 14:31.834
Great bunch
of guys, too.

14:31.868 --> 14:34.033
From now on, I'm
coming back more often.

14:34.067 --> 14:35.033
That's a promise.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.667
Nick, Nick.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.200
Alex, yo.

14:38.234 --> 14:40.868
Alex wants to play
one on one with you.

14:40.901 --> 14:42.300
Oh, yeah?

14:42.334 --> 14:43.334
Yeah.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.100
Hey, Alex, hey,
are you sure?

14:45.133 --> 14:46.701
I mean, like,
he's really good.

14:46.734 --> 14:48.234
I mean, he's
really good,

14:48.267 --> 14:49.601
you know
what I mean?

14:49.634 --> 14:51.033
Hey, what do you mean?
I mean, what's one on one?

14:51.067 --> 14:52.934
Does that mean
we can't play anymore?

14:52.968 --> 14:54.667
It means that we've
lost enough already.

14:54.701 --> 14:56.400
You lost enough-- I haven't.

14:56.434 --> 14:58.701
Hey, I'll cut you for 20.

14:58.734 --> 15:00.400
20.

15:05.968 --> 15:06.934
NICK:
Ace.

15:06.968 --> 15:08.334
Now I lost enough.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.767
Hey, could I have my shoes back?

15:13.234 --> 15:16.167
Yeah, but you can only borrow
them till I'm done here.

15:18.667 --> 15:19.634
Okay, Alex.

15:19.667 --> 15:20.767
Oh yeah, right.

15:20.801 --> 15:23.067
You get him.
We're all behind you, all right?

15:23.100 --> 15:24.601
Don't worry
about it.

15:24.634 --> 15:27.000
Okay, how
much you
playing with?

15:27.033 --> 15:29.234
Alex isn't playing
with his money.

15:29.267 --> 15:31.634
He's playing with mine.

15:31.667 --> 15:34.601
You're bankrolling
him against me,

15:34.634 --> 15:37.567
your own brother?

15:37.601 --> 15:40.868
Jeez, Louie, I always knew you
resented me and all of that

15:40.901 --> 15:44.400
but I never knew you had it in
you to do something like this.

15:44.434 --> 15:45.434
You're all right.

15:48.534 --> 15:49.868
TONY:
Hey, John, I thought

15:49.901 --> 15:51.400
you were going
to your in-laws'.

15:51.434 --> 15:53.701
Oh, I am. I forgot
and left Suzanne's
present in my locker.

15:53.734 --> 15:55.100
How's the game going?

15:55.133 --> 15:57.067
They're just
getting started.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.534
Okay, well, we'll
see you all

15:58.567 --> 15:59.634
in a couple days.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.067
Merry Christmas again.
Merry Christmas.

16:01.100 --> 16:05.033
I'm just going to call Suzanne
and tell her I'm on my way.

16:06.100 --> 16:08.801
All right, let's get started.

16:08.834 --> 16:11.601
Only we're going to make
some new rules this time.

16:11.634 --> 16:13.367
Hello, honey, I'm
just leaving the garage now,

16:13.400 --> 16:17.067
so could you ask your folks
if they'd hold dinner for me?

16:17.100 --> 16:18.901
All right.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.601
No limit on the betting.

16:21.634 --> 16:24.801
Alex, here's
$3,000.

16:24.834 --> 16:27.067
Maybe you better
tell them

16:27.100 --> 16:28.834
to start without me.

16:42.267 --> 16:43.667
JOHN:
Well, honey,

16:43.701 --> 16:46.067
Alex just raised
another 20...

16:46.100 --> 16:47.767
Nick is
smiling...

16:49.634 --> 16:51.334
Nick calls...

16:54.968 --> 16:56.367
Damn, Alex
lost again.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.400
That's the third
time in a row.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.701
Hey, Alex,
how much you
lost now?

17:00.734 --> 17:02.701
None of your
business, Banta.

17:02.734 --> 17:04.334
About 1,100.

17:04.367 --> 17:06.834
What are you--
a computer?

17:06.867 --> 17:09.032
You guys been
at this five
hours now.

17:09.067 --> 17:10.567
Couldn't
we take a break?

17:10.601 --> 17:11.834
They don't need a break.

17:11.867 --> 17:14.067
I've seen Alex play
ten, 12 hours in a row.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.733
No, look, if Nick wants to take
a break, I'll take a break.

17:17.767 --> 17:19.800
I once played for
72 hours in a row.

17:22.567 --> 17:24.067
Let's play.

17:24.099 --> 17:25.367
Hey, 72 hours.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.834
That's like
my fight with
Rocky Santocuore.

17:28.868 --> 17:32.167
Your fight
with Santocuore
lasted four minutes.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.000
I'm talking about
my recovery.

17:39.167 --> 17:41.167
I bet $500.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.367
( <i>spectators gasping</i> )

17:44.400 --> 17:46.300
I like your
style, kid.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.934
I'll see your five...

17:50.968 --> 17:52.767
and raise five.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.701
$1,500 in one pile.

17:55.734 --> 17:57.133
I don't believe it.

17:57.167 --> 17:59.100
Hey, Alex,
take it easy.

17:59.133 --> 18:02.434
I will see
your five.

18:02.467 --> 18:05.100
And I will
raise you...

18:06.934 --> 18:08.033
Five.

18:09.801 --> 18:11.501
This is
unbelievable.

18:11.534 --> 18:12.734
$2,500.

18:12.767 --> 18:15.200
Alex, you better be sure.

18:15.234 --> 18:17.601
I mean, you better be sure

18:17.634 --> 18:19.400
you're sure.

18:19.434 --> 18:21.434
I'm going to find out.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.801
I'll see it...

18:25.234 --> 18:28.834
and raise you my last $300.

18:28.868 --> 18:30.367
I'm all in.

18:36.167 --> 18:37.734
Louie, I can't
cover that.

18:37.767 --> 18:39.400
Alex, look into my eyes

18:39.434 --> 18:41.400
and tell me
that you're sure

18:41.434 --> 18:42.601
about this hand.

18:42.634 --> 18:44.834
I mean, promise
me you're sure.

18:44.868 --> 18:46.334
Say you're
positive.

18:47.701 --> 18:49.234
I'm reasonably sure.

18:52.067 --> 18:53.968
I'll get more money.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.133
More money?

18:55.167 --> 18:57.434
Where are you going
to get more money?

18:57.467 --> 18:59.467
Hey, Louie,
where you going?

18:59.501 --> 19:00.501
What are you going in there for?

19:01.868 --> 19:03.667
You're going to bet the company
receipts?

19:03.701 --> 19:06.133
What the hell do you think
you been playing with?

19:06.167 --> 19:08.334
You said it was your
life savings, Louie.

19:08.367 --> 19:10.501
I lied-- I do that sometimes.

19:10.534 --> 19:12.167
Louie, Louie

19:12.200 --> 19:14.167
Louie, Louie,
Louie, Louie.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.767
What do you mean,
I'm playing with stolen money?

19:16.801 --> 19:18.334
Yeah.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.801
( <i>groaning</i> )

19:20.834 --> 19:23.734
If you lose now,
you're in big trouble.

19:25.901 --> 19:27.267
All right.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.434
That's fine.

19:28.467 --> 19:31.601
Makes the game
a lot more interesting.

19:31.634 --> 19:34.167
He sees your bet,

19:34.200 --> 19:35.868
and raises you...

19:35.901 --> 19:37.734
another...

19:39.000 --> 19:40.200
$450.

19:41.968 --> 19:44.200
Louie, I told you I was all in.

19:44.234 --> 19:45.834
So fold.

19:45.868 --> 19:47.734
You take a check?

19:47.767 --> 19:49.567
Okay, you won't.

19:51.334 --> 19:53.934
Here, my airline ticket.

19:53.968 --> 19:55.701
It's worth $150.

19:55.734 --> 19:59.734
What do you give me
for a $300 watch?

20:01.534 --> 20:02.901
$80.

20:02.934 --> 20:05.234
Great, I only
paid $50 for it.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.534
Yeah?

20:08.567 --> 20:11.734
That's $80,
and 150

20:11.767 --> 20:12.901
is $230.

20:12.934 --> 20:15.234
I give that
guy $20 for
his shoes;

20:15.267 --> 20:16.701
that makes
it $250.

20:16.734 --> 20:18.467
I don't want
his shoes.

20:18.501 --> 20:19.667
I want my shoes.

20:19.701 --> 20:21.534
It's Christmas, Louie,
take his shoes.

20:21.567 --> 20:26.367
Okay, but
you're still
$200 short.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.601
Well, let me think.

20:27.634 --> 20:30.167
Let me do it for you.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.501
The way I figure it,

20:32.534 --> 20:37.567
three weeks for Ma
in Vegas is worth $200.

20:37.601 --> 20:39.234
You want me to bet Ma?

20:39.267 --> 20:42.834
You win?
You're off the hook.

20:42.868 --> 20:45.868
You lose?
You take her with you.

20:45.901 --> 20:47.834
You're betting
on our own mother.

20:47.868 --> 20:49.834
Right.

20:49.868 --> 20:53.000
$300, Two weeks.

20:54.834 --> 20:56.634
That stinks.

20:56.667 --> 20:59.601
Two weeks for $200.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.934
$100 a week.

21:01.968 --> 21:03.367
All right.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.033
I raise a week.

21:05.067 --> 21:06.667
I don't believe this.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.968
Okay.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.901
We see your week

21:13.934 --> 21:17.267
and raise you
another $200.

21:17.300 --> 21:18.334
Are you crazy?

21:18.367 --> 21:20.801
I can't take her
for five weeks.

21:20.834 --> 21:25.934
100 is for hugs and kisses
every day she's there.

21:25.968 --> 21:31.300
$50, You take her out to dinner
twice a week to someplace fancy,

21:31.334 --> 21:32.968
not no taco palace.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.200
And the last $50

21:34.234 --> 21:36.467
you take her
to one of those

21:36.501 --> 21:39.634
splashy floor shows
they got out there.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.434

keeping this
straight?

21:41.467 --> 21:43.133

got it.
