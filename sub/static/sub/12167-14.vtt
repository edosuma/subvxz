00:01.506 --> 00:03.425
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis...</i>

00:03.591 --> 00:06.386
What do we know about the Wraith?

00:06.553 --> 00:10.265
They are the enemy
that defeated the Ancients.

00:10.432 --> 00:13.601
<i>(Teyla) A few hundred years pass
before they awaken.</i>

00:13.768 --> 00:16.062
<i>(Teyla) We have visited many worlds.</i>

00:16.229 --> 00:18.690
I know of none untouched by the Wraith.

00:18.857 --> 00:23.361
You are doomed, as are any humans
that stand in our way.

00:23.528 --> 00:27.198
- The Ancients researched ascension.
- What is ascension?

00:27.365 --> 00:30.243
Where they rid themselves
of their physical bodies

00:30.410 --> 00:34.539
and rise to a higher plane of existence
where they live as pure energy.

00:43.423 --> 00:47.385
- I count two. How about you?
- Yes, sir. I recommend shooting back.

00:47.552 --> 00:50.347
That hit must've caused
some damage. McKay?

00:50.513 --> 00:52.974
- I'm on it.
- Where did they come from?

00:54.225 --> 00:59.230
The darts are short-range fighters.
There's probably a hive ship somewhere.

00:59.397 --> 01:02.233
- Then we need to get out of here.
- Yes, we do.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.112
- The Stargate is the other way.
- This is the scenic route. McKay!

01:06.279 --> 01:09.657
- I'm almost there.
- There's one on our tail!

01:09.824 --> 01:13.203
- Keep your eye on the other one.
- You should have weapons.

01:13.370 --> 01:14.746
- Negative.
- Sure?

01:14.913 --> 01:17.624
- Positive!
- I'm pretty sure I fixed it.

01:17.791 --> 01:20.001
Well, obviously you didn't!

01:21.252 --> 01:23.546
We could lose them in the atmosphere.

01:23.713 --> 01:26.591
- Two more darts on our two o'clock.
- I see 'em. McKay!

01:26.758 --> 01:29.761
It's not like I'm holding back on you.

01:43.942 --> 01:46.027
Hang on!

01:58.039 --> 02:02.961
- The Wraith darts have been destroyed.
- That's a good thing.

02:03.128 --> 02:07.841
I thought for sure we were dead.
Didn't you think we were dead?

02:08.008 --> 02:10.759
- What was that?
- Some sort of energy weapon.

02:10.926 --> 02:13.638
What do you say we find out?

02:16.057 --> 02:18.143
Yeah.

03:24.501 --> 03:30.465
So, just to confirm,
we're all still... definitely not dead.

03:30.632 --> 03:33.301
- I feel very much alive.
- Good. Same here.

03:33.468 --> 03:35.804
- Wish I knew what that was.
- Lightning?

03:35.970 --> 03:39.265
- Space lightning?
- It's some sort of an energy weapon.

03:39.432 --> 03:43.061
- One that destroys Wraith darts.
- But why them and not us?

03:43.228 --> 03:45.146
Assuming that we're still alive,

03:45.313 --> 03:49.317
and there doesn't appear to be
any damage, we can conclude that...

03:49.484 --> 03:53.905
Um... um...

03:54.072 --> 03:58.368
I got nothing to conclude.
I'm just talking for the sake of talking.

03:58.535 --> 04:01.830
- Are you sure you're OK?
- I hate certain death.

04:01.996 --> 04:06.209
- You're alive.
- Could it be naturally occurring?

04:06.376 --> 04:10.088
- My money's on non-naturally.
- A weapon the Ancients left?

04:10.255 --> 04:12.966
A weapon that impressive
would be powered by...

04:13.133 --> 04:15.844
A zero-point module.
We need to get down there.

04:16.011 --> 04:20.305
I've got to put down and check for damage
anyway before we head back.

04:32.652 --> 04:37.073
If there is a weapon somewhere
down here, sir, these folks didn't build it.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.744
Not these kids. Picking up anything?

04:40.910 --> 04:44.247
Everything, just nothing worth mentioning.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.709
- These folks look familiar?
- The Stargate is in orbit.

04:47.876 --> 04:50.337
My people could never
have ventured here.

04:50.503 --> 04:54.090
Right. What say we venture?

05:18.031 --> 05:20.116
Hi.

05:22.494 --> 05:24.579
It's OK. We're friendly.

05:25.830 --> 05:27.916
Hi.

05:28.917 --> 05:33.004
It is likely they have never seen anyone
from outside their village.

05:46.184 --> 05:48.019
Welcome.

05:48.186 --> 05:52.857
I am Zarah, one of the abbots of Proculis.

05:53.024 --> 05:54.693
I'm John. John Sheppard.

05:54.859 --> 05:59.364
This is Teyla, Lieutenant Ford
and Dr McKay.

06:01.074 --> 06:03.159
Please, come.

06:25.223 --> 06:29.436
This is the first time,
at least in my own lifetime,

06:29.602 --> 06:33.398
that people from another land
have come to us.

06:33.565 --> 06:36.609
Well, we came by ship.

06:36.776 --> 06:43.491
A flying... thing that allows us
to move from one world to another.

06:43.658 --> 06:49.205
- Another world?
- From among the stars in the night sky.

06:49.372 --> 06:52.208
We are peaceful explorers.

06:52.375 --> 06:56.171
Then glory to Athar
for bringing you here safely.

06:57.297 --> 07:02.469
- Athar?
- The provider and protector of all.

07:02.635 --> 07:04.179
Surely you know.

07:04.346 --> 07:07.891
Athar is known by many names
among the stars.

07:08.058 --> 07:10.268
Is Athar around?

07:10.435 --> 07:13.813
We'd love to talk to him. We're friends.

07:13.980 --> 07:18.443
Athar is friend to all, and with us always.

07:18.610 --> 07:20.695
Even now.

07:20.862 --> 07:24.616
Of course. Hi, Athar.

07:24.783 --> 07:29.371
What Dr McKay means
is that we wish to offer our thanks.

07:29.537 --> 07:34.376
We were attacked by the Wraith and would
have been killed were it not for Athar.

07:34.542 --> 07:36.836
Wraith?

07:37.003 --> 07:40.674
Pale skin, sunken eyes,
suck the life out of you with their hands.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.677
We have never encountered such beings.

07:43.843 --> 07:46.137
Never?

07:46.304 --> 07:49.224
And there is no mention of them
in your history?

07:49.391 --> 07:53.311
None. I can assure you
that for many thousands of years

07:53.478 --> 07:56.773
we have lived here in peace.

07:58.274 --> 08:00.944
Could you excuse us for a moment?

08:01.111 --> 08:04.864
Of course. Please, I must tell
the other abbots of your arrival

08:05.031 --> 08:07.158
before we go to meet with Chaya.

08:07.325 --> 08:11.496
- Chaya is...?
- The high priestess of Athar.

08:12.539 --> 08:15.291
This is a great day for our people.

08:17.669 --> 08:20.338
Ours too.

08:22.048 --> 08:25.844
- I'm not kidding. This could really work.
- I agree, Major.

08:26.011 --> 08:30.181
Every inhabited world I have encountered
has been ravaged by the Wraith.

08:30.348 --> 08:32.475
It's protected by an Ancient weapon.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.769
- This confirms it.
- Does it?

08:34.936 --> 08:38.313
The power requirements
must be astronomical.

08:38.481 --> 08:40.859
Only a ZPM could generate that.

08:41.025 --> 08:44.236
They do not appear to be
technologically advanced.

08:44.404 --> 08:47.699
Unless that guy was lying.
He doesn't seem like the lying type.

08:47.866 --> 08:50.618
So, automated defences?

08:50.785 --> 08:55.248
Lmagine a world where displaced refugees
could come and live in peace

08:55.415 --> 08:58.001
without fear of being culled by the Wraith.

08:58.168 --> 09:02.213
- We can negotiate a treaty.
- We need access to the weapon or ZPM.

09:02.380 --> 09:06.926
- Not that we'd steal it.
- Let's try to stay on our best behaviour.

09:07.093 --> 09:09.471
I'm always on my best behaviour.

09:13.141 --> 09:15.935
- How much farther?
- Not very.

09:16.102 --> 09:18.188
Oh, good.

09:19.397 --> 09:22.567
- We could have taken the jumper.
- Exercise is good.

09:22.734 --> 09:25.236
Chaya does live pretty far
from your people.

09:25.403 --> 09:29.991
It is not uncommon, Major, for clerics
to live apart from the community.

09:58.687 --> 10:01.773
- Glory to Athar.
- Welcome, and rest.

10:01.940 --> 10:04.859
Thank you, sister.

10:05.026 --> 10:10.198
- You are new to Proculis.
- Yes. We're brand-new, in fact.

10:11.616 --> 10:16.037
- Major John Sheppard.
- I am called Chaya Sar.

10:16.204 --> 10:22.085
And you are... Teyla,
Lieutenant Ford and Dr McKay.

10:22.252 --> 10:25.672
- How did she know that?
- One of the abbots ran ahead.

10:25.839 --> 10:28.675
It's a pleasure to meet you, Chaya.

10:28.842 --> 10:33.096
You must be tired after your long journey.
Shall I prepare some tea?

10:34.472 --> 10:38.351
Well, I was hoping
you were gonna say just that.

10:40.979 --> 10:44.649
- Where do they come from?
- They're everywhere in this galaxy.

10:44.816 --> 10:48.111
They've been on top of the food chain
for a long time.

10:48.278 --> 10:54.743
It's terrifying. Truly terrifying.
My heart goes out to your people, Teyla.

10:54.909 --> 10:57.120
It is not only my people who suffer.

10:57.287 --> 10:59.622
The Wraith have awakened
from a long sleep

10:59.789 --> 11:04.210
and this entire world is safe
from the culling that has already begun.

11:04.377 --> 11:09.299
Even Atlantis, with all its wonder,
may not survive the onslaught.

11:09.466 --> 11:14.554
It is our hope that Athar
could grant sanctuary here on Proculis.

11:14.721 --> 11:17.599
Sanctuary?

11:17.766 --> 11:20.310
For so many?

11:20.477 --> 11:23.813
We're not talking about
everybody in the galaxy showing up.

11:23.980 --> 11:27.484
- This planet is pretty big.
- And largely uninhabited.

11:27.650 --> 11:30.403
More importantly,
it is protected by your weapon.

11:30.570 --> 11:33.865
Weapon? I am aware
of no such thing on Proculis.

11:36.785 --> 11:39.496
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

11:39.663 --> 11:42.582
- Oh, please.
- Rodney, best behaviour.

11:42.749 --> 11:44.626
This is as good as it gets.

11:44.793 --> 11:48.213
Chaya, we're alive because of
a powerful energy weapon

11:48.380 --> 11:50.465
that emanated from this planet.

11:50.632 --> 11:54.719
It destroyed the enemy ships.
That weapon is keeping the Wraith away.

11:54.886 --> 11:57.639
No, Dr McKay.
It was Athar who protected you.

11:57.806 --> 12:01.976
- Athar?
- Yes. Athar saw you were in need.

12:03.186 --> 12:06.523
Chaya, there are a lot of people just like...

12:08.483 --> 12:12.070
you and me
who are in need because of the Wraith.

12:12.237 --> 12:16.533
What you have here,
what Athar has provided you,

12:16.700 --> 12:20.245
is a very rare thing,

12:20.412 --> 12:22.872
but we have a lot to offer too.

12:23.039 --> 12:26.918
That's what friends do. They share.

12:27.085 --> 12:29.421
I think we could help each other.

12:30.630 --> 12:33.133
I understand.

12:34.342 --> 12:37.012
I shall consult with her now.

12:39.139 --> 12:43.101
Please stay here.
I don't know how long this will take.

12:44.644 --> 12:46.312
Thank you.

12:46.479 --> 12:49.816
"What Athar provides for you?"
Are you buying into this?

12:49.983 --> 12:54.195
Rodney, what religious people
don't take their religion seriously?

12:54.362 --> 12:56.448
We didn't imagine that weapon.

12:56.614 --> 12:59.743
- We saw what it was capable of.
- Yes, we did.

12:59.909 --> 13:03.788
Perhaps Chaya is simply unaware
of the weapon's existence.

13:03.955 --> 13:06.958
Or she knows
and wants to keep it a secret from us.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.378
She doesn't strike me
as the lying type, either.

13:11.755 --> 13:15.717
All right, let's just see
what Athar has to say.

13:16.634 --> 13:20.013
So, pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain, hmm?

13:20.180 --> 13:22.265
Exactly.

13:46.790 --> 13:51.878
Major. We have conveyed your request
to our Divine Mother.

13:52.045 --> 13:55.215
She does not doubt
the righteousness of your mission,

13:55.382 --> 13:59.344
but she cannot countenance
any other people but hers settling here.

13:59.511 --> 14:02.639
You had to chant all that time
to come up with that?

14:02.806 --> 14:06.559
- McKay.
- Is there any way Athar can reconsider?

14:06.726 --> 14:08.895
Athar understands and sympathises.

14:09.062 --> 14:11.690
These Wraith are a scourge
among our stars.

14:11.856 --> 14:16.027
But she has to place
the lives of her people first.

14:16.194 --> 14:19.739
We both knew what you were gonna say
before you even went in.

14:19.906 --> 14:22.242
We prayed for Athar's guidance.

14:22.409 --> 14:24.577
And what did Athar say?

14:24.744 --> 14:28.164
You're hiding behind your religion
to justify your selfishness.

14:28.331 --> 14:32.002
- Rodney...
- If Athar existed, she would be ashamed.

14:32.168 --> 14:36.089
We ask only to be left alone and in peace.

14:36.256 --> 14:41.094
So thousands will die when they could
have been saved, all in the name of Athar.

14:41.261 --> 14:44.723
- How peaceful of you.
- You should be grateful to Athar.

14:44.889 --> 14:48.351
- This is a waste of time.
- Athar regrets that she cannot help.

14:48.518 --> 14:52.063
- I'm sure those were her exact words.
- That's enough!

14:53.398 --> 14:56.234
Head back to the jumper.
I'll be there in a minute.

14:56.401 --> 14:58.445
- Why?
- 'Cause you're not helping.

14:58.611 --> 15:00.697
Yes, sir.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.957
I apologise.

15:11.124 --> 15:14.210
He acts only in accordance to his beliefs,
as do we.

15:14.377 --> 15:17.213
But Rodney is right about one thing.

15:17.380 --> 15:20.717
This really is about lives, human lives.

15:20.884 --> 15:23.970
The Wraith will show up in Atlantis.
When they do...

15:24.137 --> 15:28.516
- You're a warrior.
- Well, I don't know about "warrior".

15:28.683 --> 15:31.519
It is your vocation, Major. You will fight.

15:31.686 --> 15:36.775
I'll try, but knowing what we're up against,
and the odds...

15:38.193 --> 15:42.489
Look, I'd appreciate it
if you would ask Athar

15:42.655 --> 15:46.785
to consider that we are her people.

15:47.827 --> 15:52.874
Even though we come from very far away,
we're the same, we're human,

15:53.041 --> 15:55.919
which means we're not strangers,
we're family.

16:02.425 --> 16:04.386
Whoa.

16:04.552 --> 16:06.304
Evening breeze.

16:07.347 --> 16:09.891
I was hoping it was a sign from Athar.

16:10.058 --> 16:13.019
Your words are most compelling,
Major Sheppard.

16:13.186 --> 16:15.855
Thank you. I was going for compelling.

16:16.022 --> 16:18.358
Do you truly believe we are family?

16:18.525 --> 16:20.777
We are. I can prove it to you.

16:20.944 --> 16:23.196
- How?
- Come back to Atlantis.

16:23.363 --> 16:26.991
See who we really are.
Once Athar learns more about us...

16:27.158 --> 16:29.327
- This is acceptable.
- It is?

16:30.537 --> 16:33.999
Chaya, please, you cannot leave.

16:34.165 --> 16:38.128
Athar is with us always,
no matter where we are, Zarah.

16:44.426 --> 16:46.511
I understand.

16:51.391 --> 16:53.476
I am ready.

16:56.563 --> 16:59.399
- Welcome to Atlantis.
- Thank you.

16:59.566 --> 17:02.569
Our doctors do require a medical exam

17:02.736 --> 17:05.571
of all off-planet team members
and our visitors.

17:05.739 --> 17:08.324
- Then perhaps you'd like a tour.
- I would.

17:08.491 --> 17:11.243
Major Sheppard
has already promised to do so.

17:11.411 --> 17:13.704
- Of course he has.
- Of course I have.

17:13.872 --> 17:16.040
If you'll follow me to the infirmary.

17:16.207 --> 17:19.544
- Maybe I should tag along...
- I think I got a handle.

17:19.711 --> 17:23.256
- There are a lot of systems you know...
- Got it covered.

17:24.758 --> 17:26.425
Fine.

17:35.018 --> 17:37.771
Hold still. Just a minute more.

17:40.315 --> 17:44.986
Well, it seems you're just as lovely
on the inside as you are on the out,

17:45.153 --> 17:48.031
if health is synonymous with beauty.

17:48.198 --> 17:50.075
You can get up now.

17:50.241 --> 17:52.827
How does this device
do what you say it does?

17:52.994 --> 17:55.914
It creates images of the tissues
inside your body.

17:56.081 --> 18:00.460
- They are picture perfect.
- Are these machines from your world?

18:00.627 --> 18:04.839
Some. Others are Atlantean technology
that we've figured out how to use,

18:05.006 --> 18:08.885
and a few, well, I haven't
the vaguest idea of what they do.

18:09.052 --> 18:11.888
Hopefully one day
I'll meet one and ask them.

18:12.055 --> 18:17.185
- Do you know what happened to them?
- Some returned to Earth after the war.

18:17.352 --> 18:20.563
That much we know.
But some of them ascended.

18:20.730 --> 18:22.273
Ascended?

18:22.440 --> 18:25.568
To a higher plane,
where they exist only as energy.

18:25.735 --> 18:28.697
Are all the people of your world
as healthy as you?

18:28.863 --> 18:30.615
Yes.

18:30.782 --> 18:35.286
No disease, ailments?
No one ever breaks a leg?

18:35.453 --> 18:38.790
Such things are rare,
but my people heal quite rapidly.

18:38.957 --> 18:40.625
Really?

18:43.294 --> 18:45.839
- Are we done?
- Are we?

18:46.006 --> 18:49.134
Healthiest patient I've ever had.
Off you go, love.

18:54.389 --> 18:57.392
- Where are we?
- Either she knows where the weapon is,

18:57.559 --> 19:00.228
or she has no idea
and we are wasting our time.

19:00.395 --> 19:04.065
- What do you suggest?
- Scan the planet for energy signatures.

19:04.232 --> 19:09.320
They won't know what we're doing unless
they're advanced and pretending not to be,

19:09.487 --> 19:11.823
which has happened before.

19:11.990 --> 19:15.910
Did you find something that would suggest
they are more advanced?

19:16.077 --> 19:20.498
No. They're pathetically pretechnological
or brilliantly post-technological.

19:20.665 --> 19:22.917
There's no way this could be natural?

19:23.084 --> 19:26.129
A timed energy burst
that only affected Wraith ships?

19:26.296 --> 19:28.465
- That's a no?
- That's a no.

19:28.631 --> 19:33.094
<i>- Dr Weir, I have those results.
- Thank you, Carson. We're on our way.</i>

19:36.264 --> 19:38.141
How many of you are there?

19:38.308 --> 19:41.644
Counting the Athosians on the mainland,
a couple of hundred,

19:41.811 --> 19:44.105
which leaves a very large, empty city.

19:44.272 --> 19:49.486
We're living in one section because
we don't have the power to spread out.

19:51.446 --> 19:53.656
What do you think so far?

19:53.823 --> 19:56.284
I think it's wondrous.

19:56.451 --> 19:59.162
But ultimately the decision is up to Athar.

20:01.456 --> 20:03.750
You're not a believer, are you?

20:03.917 --> 20:08.254
Look, Chaya, I respect that you believe.

20:08.421 --> 20:13.385
Look, I can't talk to Athar. I can only talk
to you, so let me ask you this.

20:13.551 --> 20:16.221
What if the shoe was on the other foot?

20:16.388 --> 20:18.890
What if your people were in trouble?

20:19.057 --> 20:22.686
Would you just take no for an answer?

20:22.852 --> 20:26.940
It must have been very hard
to live under the shadow of the Wraith.

20:28.858 --> 20:32.112
Teyla and her people
have known the Wraith for ever,

20:32.278 --> 20:35.156
but when I say we're new,
I mean we just got here.

20:35.323 --> 20:37.701
We're from a planet called Earth.

20:37.867 --> 20:40.537
- Earth?
- It's very far away.

20:40.704 --> 20:45.083
Those clusters of stars in the night sky,
some of 'em are called galaxies.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.752
They're even further away than the stars.

20:47.919 --> 20:50.046
Earth is in one of those galaxies.

20:50.213 --> 20:53.258
- You came through the Stargate?
- That's right.

20:53.425 --> 20:57.262
- And can you not simply return?
- Well, not simply.

20:57.429 --> 21:01.433
We knew that it was probably
going to be a one-way trip,

21:01.599 --> 21:05.353
but we thought what we would find here
would be worth the risk.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.605
- And is it?
- So far.

21:07.772 --> 21:10.358
Ask me again when the Wraith show up.

21:10.525 --> 21:14.946
Blood work shows no viral,
bacterial or parasitic infections.

21:15.113 --> 21:20.493
MRI reveals no tumours or cancers,
no heart defects of any kind.

21:20.660 --> 21:26.374
Blood pressure 130 over 70.
Total cholesterol 107.

21:26.541 --> 21:28.418
She's in perfect health.

21:28.585 --> 21:31.838
I'm happy for her.
Why did we need to see this?

21:32.005 --> 21:34.591
- She's too healthy.
- What does that mean?

21:34.758 --> 21:37.385
There's no trace of congenital conditions

21:37.552 --> 21:40.972
that you typically find
in pretechnological societies.

21:41.139 --> 21:43.683
No rickets, no fungi, STDs...

21:43.850 --> 21:45.727
- Perfect health?
- Aye.

21:45.894 --> 21:49.439
From what she told me,
this may be the norm among her people.

21:49.606 --> 21:51.816
- But she is human?
- Without a doubt.

21:51.983 --> 21:56.780
- How is that possible?
- I can't say for certain.

21:56.946 --> 22:01.326
But if this data is accurate,
people on Proculis live in optimal health

22:01.493 --> 22:03.370
for a very, very long time.

22:03.536 --> 22:07.791
- You make it sound like some sort of a...
- Paradise? Because it is.

22:07.957 --> 22:10.752
And that's a problem because...?

22:10.919 --> 22:16.132
Because human life, quite simply,
Dr Weir, is more fragile than that.

22:17.467 --> 22:21.137
I don't care what galaxy we're in,
it's unnatural.

22:28.770 --> 22:31.064
The ocean air is so invigorating.

22:31.231 --> 22:35.151
Plenty of that here.
Most of the planet's ocean.

22:36.277 --> 22:39.322
<i>(Chaya) There's enough land
to resettle the refugees.</i>

22:39.489 --> 22:42.867
Well, there is.
We just can't guarantee their safety.

22:43.034 --> 22:45.161
Even though you control all of this?

22:45.328 --> 22:49.416
I'd be lying if I said we controlled it all.

22:49.582 --> 22:52.961
This place is so far beyond us
in so many ways.

22:53.128 --> 22:57.465
We have a shield that can withstand
anything the Wraith could throw at us,

22:57.632 --> 22:59.843
but we have no way of powering it up.

23:00.010 --> 23:03.680
We can't risk taking in any more refugees
than we already have.

23:06.349 --> 23:08.893
Come with me.

23:10.311 --> 23:13.398
- Major Sheppard...
- I'd prefer you to call me John.

23:13.565 --> 23:17.110
John. How did you make enemies
of the Wraith?

23:17.277 --> 23:19.696
- That was my fault.
- Yours?

23:19.863 --> 23:22.657
I woke them up
trying to rescue some people.

23:22.824 --> 23:24.951
They didn't take too kindly to that.

23:25.118 --> 23:27.412
But you saved your people?

23:27.579 --> 23:29.456
Most of 'em.

23:29.622 --> 23:31.916
You know for sure they're coming back?

23:32.083 --> 23:35.045
Yeah, we just don't know when.

23:35.211 --> 23:38.006
Main control console,

23:38.173 --> 23:40.467
environmental support systems,

23:40.633 --> 23:42.719
communications.

23:42.886 --> 23:46.306
And this... This is, uh...

23:46.473 --> 23:48.016
<i>(mouths)</i>

23:48.975 --> 23:51.853
Sorry, Major.
We haven't the faintest idea what...

23:54.731 --> 23:58.234
This is a new piece of equipment
we found in the city.

23:58.401 --> 24:00.904
- It hadn't been initialised.
- She has...

24:01.071 --> 24:02.947
She has the gene.

24:03.114 --> 24:07.786
- Did I do this? What does the machine do?
- We don't know. Not yet, anyway.

24:07.952 --> 24:10.455
The Atlanteans were good at lots of things.

24:10.622 --> 24:13.667
Writing instruction manuals
wasn't one of 'em.

24:13.833 --> 24:16.961
We should probably wrap this tour up.

24:17.128 --> 24:20.173
I know Dr Weir is anxious to talk to you.

24:21.091 --> 24:24.594
- Will I see you afterwards?
- And during.

24:28.390 --> 24:30.892
We are proposing a kind of land lease

24:31.059 --> 24:35.563
in which refugees rendered homeless
by the Wraith could resettle on Proculis.

24:35.730 --> 24:38.858
In return, we can offer you
services and knowledge.

24:39.025 --> 24:42.696
- Such as?
- You've seen the technology we possess.

24:42.862 --> 24:45.907
We could help you down a path
to an industrialised society

24:46.074 --> 24:49.369
while maintaining
your planet's ecological balance.

24:49.536 --> 24:54.124
Your scientific knowledge is impressive,
Dr Weir, but we have no need of it.

24:54.290 --> 24:56.960
Athar provides us
with everything we require.

24:57.127 --> 25:00.588
Well, food just doesn't show up
on the dinner table.

25:00.755 --> 25:03.717
- You plant all your own crops?
- Of course we do.

25:03.883 --> 25:06.094
We can help increase your crop yields.

25:06.261 --> 25:10.640
We grow all the food we need to live.
Anything else would be gluttony.

25:10.807 --> 25:15.770
- Building materials, then.
- We have abundant timber and iron ore.

25:15.937 --> 25:18.023
Athar is kind.

25:21.901 --> 25:24.112
There must be something.

25:24.279 --> 25:27.824
What my people value most
is spiritual knowledge.

25:27.991 --> 25:31.453
What can your culture provide
in that regard?

25:33.455 --> 25:37.250
Earth's people don't share
a single spiritual belief.

25:37.417 --> 25:41.212
We embrace a number
of different religions and philosophies.

25:41.379 --> 25:46.301
Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam...

25:46.468 --> 25:49.596
Hinduism, Kwanzaa...

25:50.597 --> 25:52.682
Interesting. Tell me about them.

25:52.849 --> 25:57.020
- All of them?
- Yes. They sound fascinating.

25:57.187 --> 26:01.566
I am hardly competent to discuss
all religions, but I can offer you resources.

26:01.733 --> 26:04.861
You could have access
to our historical database.

26:05.695 --> 26:08.406
That would be wonderful.

26:11.034 --> 26:13.119
- You got it working?
- Yeah.

26:13.286 --> 26:15.497
Well, do we know what it does?

26:15.664 --> 26:18.541
It's an internal-external
biometric sensor array.

26:18.708 --> 26:23.171
See, now, sadly, I understood that.
Where did all those Saturday nights go?

26:23.338 --> 26:26.091
These are biosignatures
of everyone in Atlantis.

26:26.257 --> 26:28.593
How can you tell?

26:28.760 --> 26:31.388
I've been deciphering
the Ancient logarithms.

26:31.554 --> 26:34.015
I suspect this was
an early-warning system

26:34.182 --> 26:36.810
to signal any alien presence in the city.

26:36.976 --> 26:40.188
And it activated
when our visitor touched it?

26:40.355 --> 26:42.482
So she has the Ancient gene.

26:42.649 --> 26:46.277
Or it only activated
because it was detecting her.

26:46.444 --> 26:50.532
She could be an alien and this thing
knows more about her than we do.

26:50.699 --> 26:54.035
- We should be keeping an eye on her.
- Major Sheppard is.

26:54.202 --> 26:57.247
- I'm sure.
- Not entirely for the reasons you think.

26:57.414 --> 27:00.333
- Dr Weir asked him to.
- I'm sure she did.

27:06.798 --> 27:09.801
- Weir wanted Chaya to see everything.
- Everything?

27:09.968 --> 27:14.139
Not everything. Chaya wanted
to see the best view of the city at night,

27:14.305 --> 27:17.183
which I think is atop the south-west pier,

27:17.350 --> 27:22.063
and since it's such a long walk,
I thought I'd bring along a few provisions.

27:22.230 --> 27:24.858
Continuing our efforts to secure a treaty.

27:25.025 --> 27:27.944
- Exactly.
- As our ambassador.

27:30.488 --> 27:36.036
I am an ambassador
and she is a diplomat.

27:36.202 --> 27:39.539
On a late-night... picnic?

27:40.582 --> 27:42.625
Yes.

27:42.792 --> 27:46.296
I know that as ranking military officer
here in Atlantis,

27:46.463 --> 27:49.632
you feel a heavy burden of responsibility,

27:49.799 --> 27:53.136
but you are allowed
to have feelings for others.

27:54.054 --> 27:59.601
No, this is an ambassadorial,
diplomatic picnic outing... thing.

27:59.768 --> 28:03.021
Without having to justify them to anyone.

28:04.898 --> 28:06.983
Goodnight, Major.

28:08.735 --> 28:10.820
Goodnight, Teyla.

28:15.659 --> 28:18.953
- Send her back?
- She's not who she's pretending to be.

28:19.120 --> 28:22.082
- You know this because...?
- I can't have intuition?

28:22.248 --> 28:25.293
No. I asked Major Sheppard
to keep an eye on her.

28:25.460 --> 28:28.463
Which is like asking the fox
to guard the hen-house.

28:28.630 --> 28:30.006
What?

28:30.173 --> 28:34.094
The biometric differential
is not insignificant, Elizabeth.

28:34.260 --> 28:37.555
What I'm saying is
the woman set off an alien alarm.

28:37.722 --> 28:39.599
You don't know that for certain.

28:39.766 --> 28:43.728
You are nowhere close
to understanding the nature of that device.

28:43.895 --> 28:46.773
There are too many unknown variables:
The weapon,

28:46.940 --> 28:50.527
they claim never to have seen the Wraith,
she's healthy.

28:50.694 --> 28:53.071
Very mysterious, but what does it prove?

28:53.238 --> 28:56.116
We should give her
a one-way ticket back home.

28:56.282 --> 29:01.663
There is something different about her, but
that doesn't necessarily make her a threat.

29:01.830 --> 29:03.915
It doesn't rule it out, either.

29:04.082 --> 29:10.547
Then what we could gain by securing
a treaty is worth the risk of her being here.

29:10.714 --> 29:12.090
Fine.

29:15.927 --> 29:17.303
Mmm.

29:17.470 --> 29:19.973
This is delicious.

29:20.140 --> 29:23.810
Well, enjoy it while you can.
That's the last of what we have.

29:23.977 --> 29:26.521
Then I am honoured.

29:26.688 --> 29:29.149
When McKay finds out, he's gonna kill me.

29:29.315 --> 29:31.693
- Athar will save you.
- Oh, good.

29:34.529 --> 29:36.614
Such wondrous things.

29:36.781 --> 29:41.244
I can't imagine wanting to do anything
but eat with such variety of foods.

29:41.411 --> 29:44.414
We manage
to pull ourselves away somehow.

29:44.581 --> 29:46.708
I've been learning much about Earth.

29:46.875 --> 29:49.669
Dr Weir has got me
on your information machines.

29:49.836 --> 29:52.797
Elizabeth's got you
on a computer already, huh?

29:52.964 --> 29:55.342
I'm fascinated by your many religions.

29:55.508 --> 29:58.386
So many beliefs, so many philosophies.

29:58.553 --> 30:02.432
- Yeah, we got a few of those.
- So many contradictory faiths.

30:02.599 --> 30:05.643
Yeah, it's a bit of a mess.

30:07.020 --> 30:09.731
- More?
- Yes, please.

30:10.732 --> 30:13.234
We traded for grapes.

30:14.319 --> 30:18.490
The Athosians, Teyla's people,
they make this on the mainland.

30:19.282 --> 30:23.286
I wasn't completely truthful with you
about something.

30:26.706 --> 30:29.834
On Proculis, when I told you
I did not feel lonely...

30:31.211 --> 30:33.588
Coming here and being with you...

30:35.298 --> 30:38.218
...it reminded me
what it was like not to be alone.

30:45.350 --> 30:48.436
- What?
- Well, I mean, nothing.

30:48.603 --> 30:51.564
It's just that this is the first time

30:51.731 --> 30:55.610
I've been in a romantic situation
with a woman from another planet.

30:55.777 --> 30:57.988
It just strikes me as really, um...

30:58.154 --> 31:00.240
- Wrong?
- No! God, no.

31:00.407 --> 31:03.451
Just... funny.

31:04.452 --> 31:07.497
I'm sorry. I just thought that I would, uh...

31:08.373 --> 31:11.167
You said it yourself, we're both human.

31:11.334 --> 31:13.795
Yes, we are.

31:15.005 --> 31:19.300
And I'm really glad you didn't say "family",
otherwise I'd have to leave.

31:20.677 --> 31:22.762
Don't.

31:27.809 --> 31:30.311
I'm not going anywhere.

31:48.663 --> 31:50.123
Major.

31:50.290 --> 31:54.336
- Rodney. What are you doing up so late?
- I couldn't sleep.

31:54.502 --> 31:57.172
I was going to do a little research. You?

31:57.339 --> 32:00.425
- No, thanks.
- What were you doing up so late?

32:00.592 --> 32:02.719
I'm always up late, Rodney.

32:02.886 --> 32:07.432
A word of caution. The whole
Captain Kirk routine is problematic,

32:07.599 --> 32:09.768
let alone morally dubious.

32:09.934 --> 32:12.270
- Routine?
- Romancing the alien priestess.

32:12.437 --> 32:14.481
Very 1967 of you. I'm surprised...

32:14.647 --> 32:18.276
If and when anything I do
becomes your business...

32:18.443 --> 32:21.821
An alien woman
who is clearly not who she claims to be

32:21.988 --> 32:24.783
has you wrapped around her little finger.

32:24.949 --> 32:29.454
- Don't go there, McKay.
- I know I'm not normally Mr Sensitive.

32:29.621 --> 32:31.998
But there is something about her.

32:32.165 --> 32:35.794
- It's intangible, but I can feel it.
- I said don't go there!

32:35.960 --> 32:39.506
It's just a matter of time
before I prove it, Major.

32:39.673 --> 32:42.634
I recommend that in the meantime,
you keep your...

33:01.236 --> 33:03.321
- Did you sleep last night?
- No.

33:03.488 --> 33:05.991
This is the data
from the biometric sensors.

33:06.157 --> 33:09.786
I can't tell you what
all these signatures mean, but look at this.

33:09.953 --> 33:13.623
These are ours and this is hers.
There's a distinct difference.

33:13.790 --> 33:16.626
She was born on another planet
in another galaxy.

33:16.793 --> 33:19.963
- They're different from Teyla's.
- It doesn't mean...

33:20.130 --> 33:24.968
- She's not what she seems to be.
- I sense an honest and spiritual person.

33:25.135 --> 33:28.179
All right. There may be a way to find out.

33:28.346 --> 33:31.349
You're opening negotiations with her?
Let me sit in.

33:31.516 --> 33:34.477
I'll pretend to take notes on the laptop
and scan her.

33:34.644 --> 33:37.480
Radiation, EM scans, energy signatures...

33:37.647 --> 33:41.735
That way, if I am crazy, you and I
are the only ones who need to know.

33:41.901 --> 33:44.821
- What's the harm?
- All right.

33:45.572 --> 33:48.241
- But be discreet.
- I'm Mr Discreet.

33:51.661 --> 33:55.206
I'm impressed by most
of what I've read of Earth religions.

33:55.373 --> 33:58.835
The Torah, the Koran,
the Talmud, the Bible...

33:59.002 --> 34:02.547
Most reveal a diverse and deep desire
to grasp the divine.

34:02.714 --> 34:06.634
- So we have something to offer you.
- I've also read about your history.

34:06.801 --> 34:10.972
Even now, somewhere on your planet,
you are at war.

34:11.139 --> 34:13.224
Well, yeah, that's true.

34:13.391 --> 34:18.063
I made no attempt to hide that fact
from you. We are definitely not perfect.

34:18.228 --> 34:21.358
There's a lot about you as a people
I find disturbing.

34:21.524 --> 34:24.194
- Can that not be said of any people?
- No.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.112
Every soul in Proculis
is free from the hatred

34:27.280 --> 34:29.949
people from Earth
seem to feel for each other.

34:30.116 --> 34:33.870
- We're not all that bad. You know that.
- I do.

34:34.036 --> 34:40.502
I'm talking about every member
of my expedition team here in Atlantis

34:40.668 --> 34:44.839
and the friends we've met
since coming here, like Teyla's people.

34:45.005 --> 34:48.217
There are some among you,
yourself included, Dr Weir,

34:48.385 --> 34:51.388
that I know Athar would welcome
with open arms.

34:51.554 --> 34:53.431
But there are others.

34:53.598 --> 34:56.266
I hand-picked
every member of this expedition,

34:56.434 --> 35:00.522
and I know Teyla feels as confident
about her own people.

35:00.689 --> 35:05.026
- I'm sure.
- This is a matter of trust.

35:05.193 --> 35:09.155
Yes. It is, Dr Weir.

35:10.699 --> 35:14.619
Have your scans
found anything yet, Dr McKay?

35:14.786 --> 35:16.913
Uh...

35:18.081 --> 35:20.166
Actually...

35:22.002 --> 35:23.586
...no.

35:23.753 --> 35:26.339
- What the hell is this?
- I'm sorry, Major.

35:26.506 --> 35:29.217
There was cause
for legitimate concern as to...

35:29.384 --> 35:31.803
Whether I was or not who I claimed to be.

35:31.970 --> 35:34.597
I'm sorry, Chaya.
I felt it would do no harm.

35:34.764 --> 35:37.267
Stop apologising, Elizabeth.

35:37.434 --> 35:39.310
- How did she know?
- McKay.

35:39.477 --> 35:41.855
- She's an Ancient, Major.
- She's what?

35:42.022 --> 35:46.776
I'm right, aren't I? The perfect health,
the energy weapon, she has the gene.

35:46.943 --> 35:51.406
- It's the only logical explanation.
- What the hell are you talking about?

35:51.573 --> 35:53.491
I just don't understand the act.

35:53.658 --> 35:58.330
You must know we'd give anything
to talk to you, to learn from you.

35:58.496 --> 36:02.250
What is it? Are you checking us out?

36:03.168 --> 36:06.838
In my desire to come to Atlantis,
I have revealed too much.

36:07.005 --> 36:09.632
- He's right?
- I'm right?

36:09.799 --> 36:12.886
I am what you call an Ancient,

36:13.053 --> 36:17.015
and it is also true that I can never
offer your people sanctuary.

36:17.182 --> 36:20.101
But you are wrong as to why I came here.

36:20.268 --> 36:22.604
Why did you come here?

36:22.771 --> 36:25.690
You, John.

36:25.857 --> 36:27.275
Me?

36:27.442 --> 36:31.279
I have lived in solitude for so long
that when you asked me to come...

36:31.446 --> 36:34.074
Oh, my God, he is Kirk.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.326
So this was never about...

36:39.120 --> 36:41.831
Could we just have a moment
to ourselves here?

36:41.998 --> 36:43.583
<i>(all) No.</i>

36:43.750 --> 36:47.921
That's all right.
I've stayed here long enough.

36:56.137 --> 37:00.809
Come on. You and your people were
the reason we came here in the first place.

37:00.975 --> 37:03.061
I can't... I can't...

37:10.402 --> 37:12.278
No.

37:12.445 --> 37:14.781
What the hell was that?

37:14.948 --> 37:19.160
They're coming for them.
I should have never left them.

37:19.327 --> 37:21.538
What's going on?

37:21.705 --> 37:24.207
I'm sorry, John.

37:45.311 --> 37:47.689
I'm taking a jumper back to Proculis.

37:47.856 --> 37:51.443
- What just happened?
- There's only one way to find out.

37:51.609 --> 37:53.695
Go.

38:15.216 --> 38:17.677
Sure you know what you're flying into?

38:17.844 --> 38:20.347
The Wraith are attacking Chaya's people.

38:22.349 --> 38:25.018
You can't hope
to defend them with one ship!

38:25.185 --> 38:27.312
I don't think I'll have to.

39:05.183 --> 39:08.061
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to help you.

39:08.228 --> 39:11.147
- Help me?
- To defend your people.

39:13.566 --> 39:17.862
Leave. I will take care of this.

39:58.862 --> 40:02.866
Is it Chaya or Athar? I'm just curious.

40:03.033 --> 40:06.953
When I was a mortal, I lived here.
This was my home.

40:07.120 --> 40:10.040
When those of us you call
the Ancients ascended,

40:10.206 --> 40:13.418
we were supposed to leave behind us
all human ties.

40:13.585 --> 40:16.129
Some of us found that difficult.

40:16.296 --> 40:19.716
You couldn't watch your people
get wiped out by the Wraith.

40:19.883 --> 40:24.679
When their fleet approached, I lashed out
with my mind and destroyed them all.

40:24.846 --> 40:30.143
The others of my kind
did not approve of such interference.

40:30.935 --> 40:33.355
And so I was exiled.

40:33.521 --> 40:37.734
My punishment was
the unending protection of this world.

40:42.906 --> 40:45.367
Why pretend to be human at all?

40:45.533 --> 40:48.787
So that, time to time,
I may walk among the people,

40:48.953 --> 40:52.332
know them as the good
and kind souls they are.

40:53.541 --> 40:57.087
For thousands of years,
I have come and gone to the villages,

40:57.253 --> 41:00.882
never staying too long
to get attached to anyone...

41:01.049 --> 41:03.093
until I met you.

41:04.719 --> 41:09.265
I have never regretted the choice I've made
all of these years... until now.

41:11.518 --> 41:14.729
I am permitted
to safeguard my people only.

41:14.896 --> 41:18.108
But this is my punishment.

41:18.274 --> 41:21.569
This is what makes it punishment.

41:21.736 --> 41:25.991
If your people came here for
my protection, the others would stop me.

41:26.157 --> 41:30.036
Do you understand?
I can never help your people.

41:32.664 --> 41:35.792
I'm not sure
I'm willing to walk away that easily,

41:35.959 --> 41:40.380
and I'm not just talking personally,
although that's definitely part of it.

41:42.257 --> 41:44.884
There is so much more
we can learn from you.

41:45.051 --> 41:47.929
I can't, John. The others won't allow it.

41:48.096 --> 41:51.224
- That's...
- It's their highest law to never interfere.

41:52.559 --> 41:56.896
I am bound by those laws,
however much I wish to help you.

41:57.897 --> 42:01.443
- So, we can never...
- I can never leave.

42:02.902 --> 42:04.988
Well, I could come and visit.

42:08.325 --> 42:11.494
Now I'm flirting with somebody
from another species.

42:11.661 --> 42:14.372
We're not as different as you think.

42:14.539 --> 42:16.916
We're more different than you think.

42:18.418 --> 42:21.171
I can show you.

42:21.338 --> 42:24.174
- Show me?
- By sharing each other.

42:25.383 --> 42:28.386
We will know each other
as well as anyone ever can.

42:29.637 --> 42:33.391
OK. I gotta get the car
back by midnight, though.

42:34.684 --> 42:36.895
This will only take a few moments.

42:39.022 --> 42:41.107
Just close your eyes.

42:50.950 --> 42:53.036
This is cool.
