04:53.993 --> 04:55.927
What the hell
are you doing to me?

04:58.998 --> 05:01.694
What are you doing?

05:01.767 --> 05:04.167
Goddamn it! Where am I?
A boat.

05:04.236 --> 05:06.704
A fishing boat.
You were in the water.

05:06.772 --> 05:09.741
We pull you out.
What water?

05:09.808 --> 05:12.072
You were shot.
See? There are the bullets.

05:12.144 --> 05:16.376
Ohh. Look. There is
a number for a bank.

05:16.448 --> 05:18.939
Why was it in your hip?

05:19.018 --> 05:20.576
My hip?
Why was it in your hip?

05:20.652 --> 05:24.611
Yeah. In your hip under the skin.
Uh. Oh, God!

05:24.690 --> 05:28.888
You need to rest.
Wait. Please. Slow down.

05:28.961 --> 05:33.591
I'm a friend.
I'm your friend. Huh?

05:33.665 --> 05:37.260
My name is Giancarlo.
Who are you?

05:38.737 --> 05:42.138
What's your name?
What's your name?

05:42.207 --> 05:44.266
Uh, I don't know.

05:46.478 --> 05:49.003
Oh, God.

06:15.607 --> 06:18.474
It's been confirmed, sir.
Mission failed.

07:38.323 --> 07:40.257
If you want to eat,
you better get in there.

07:40.325 --> 07:43.988
Based on these charts, I think
I may have been closer to the coast.

07:44.062 --> 07:46.758
What's this?
You tied these knots?

07:46.832 --> 07:48.800
So it start
to come back, huh?

07:48.867 --> 07:51.358
No, it doesn't start to come back.
The knot's like everything else.

07:51.436 --> 07:53.802
I just found the rope
and I did it.

07:53.872 --> 07:56.670
The same way I can...
I can read, I can write.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.176
I can add, subtract. I can make coffee.
I can shuffle cards.

07:59.244 --> 08:01.940
I can set up a chessboard.
Yes, yes. It will come back.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.346
No, it's not coming back,
goddamn it! That's the point!

08:06.051 --> 08:10.010
I'm down here looking through all this shit.
For two weeks I'm down here.

08:10.088 --> 08:12.818
It's not working. I don't
even know what to look for.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.190
You need to rest.

08:19.264 --> 08:22.529
It will come back.
What if it doesn't come back?

08:25.704 --> 08:28.537
We get in there tomorrow,
l-I don't even have a name.

08:59.571 --> 09:03.371
It's not much, but it should get you
to Switzerland.

09:07.012 --> 09:09.003
Thank you.

10:46.144 --> 10:48.135
Hey.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.382
All right.

11:00.659 --> 11:03.184
No. L-I don't...

11:03.261 --> 11:07.220
I don't have any papers. I lost...

11:38.663 --> 11:41.826
These people have threatened
my family, my babies.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.664
So I'm telling you,
when the evidence is clear...

11:44.736 --> 11:46.966
I will have a nice story
for you to read about.

11:47.038 --> 11:50.303
And all my friends out there,
you will read about yourselves.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.400
Cause if you want to play this game...

11:52.477 --> 11:55.469
after I've been reasonable,
I will show you.

11:55.547 --> 11:59.779
That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking
in Paris the day before yesterday.

11:59.851 --> 12:02.115
He was an irritation
before he took power...

12:02.187 --> 12:05.987
he was a problem when he was in power
and he's been a disaster for us in exile.

12:06.057 --> 12:10.153
He's writing a book about the agency's
history in Africa. He's going to name names.

12:10.228 --> 12:13.163
It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding the agency's help.

12:13.231 --> 12:17.361
He wants us to put him back
in power in six months or else.

12:17.436 --> 12:21.202
This interview, and I'll make the tape
available to anyone who wants it...

12:21.273 --> 12:24.470
he goes on to claim that he's just
survived an assassination attempt.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.338
He says it's us.
He says he's got proof.

12:30.048 --> 12:34.508
The director wants to know if there's
any possible shred of truth in this accusation.

12:34.586 --> 12:38.784
I've already assured him there's nobody
that reckless on my senior staff.

12:45.263 --> 12:50.132
I was recalling a conversation we had some
time ago, talking about Treadstone.

12:50.202 --> 12:53.831
I seem to remember Nykwana Wombosi's name
might have come up.

12:55.540 --> 12:57.474
I'm not sure
what we're talking about.

12:57.542 --> 13:02.411
Someone tried to take him out.
Tried and failed.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.906
Was this Treadstone?

13:05.984 --> 13:08.885
You're asking me
a direct question?

13:08.954 --> 13:12.321
Yes.
I thought you were never gonna do that.

13:12.390 --> 13:15.018
What happened?

13:15.093 --> 13:20.895
Well, we, uh, lost
communication with our man.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.957
This was almost
two weeks ago.

13:23.034 --> 13:25.594
We've been working
around the clock, the whole unit.

13:25.670 --> 13:28.639
We've been sleeping down there.
Believe me, we're doing everything we can.

13:28.707 --> 13:32.609
And you don't let me know this?
You never wanted to before.

13:32.677 --> 13:35.544
You never made
a mistake before.

14:09.948 --> 14:13.440
Uh, yes. I'm here about
a numbered account.

14:13.518 --> 14:17.113
If you just enter your account number here,
I'll direct you to an appropriate officer.

16:18.276 --> 16:20.506
My name is Jason Bourne.

16:27.118 --> 16:29.245
I live in Paris.

18:25.770 --> 18:29.763
Yes. In Paris. Do you have
the number for a Jason Bourne?

18:31.776 --> 18:33.801
Yes, sir. Would you
like me to connect you?

18:33.878 --> 18:36.346
Yes. Please.

18:39.083 --> 18:43.486
This is 4-6-9-9-0-3-8-4.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.489
Leave a message at the beep.

19:50.788 --> 19:52.847
I'm an American.
Okay.

19:53.958 --> 19:56.119
Hold it. Wait.

19:56.194 --> 19:58.492
You have no jurisdiction here.

20:04.068 --> 20:07.435
No. Excuse me. No.
This is not my current address, okay?

20:07.505 --> 20:09.439
This was my current address
until two days ago...

20:09.507 --> 20:11.737
when I started standing
in line outside.

20:11.809 --> 20:16.906
Now, I lose my apartment, okay?That means
no address, no phone, no money, no time.

20:16.981 --> 20:20.747
- I still have no visa.
- Miss Kreutz, I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.

20:20.818 --> 20:24.811
Excuse me. But where's the guy
that I talked to last week?

20:24.889 --> 20:27.323
Every week it's a new person.
How am I supposed to...

20:27.392 --> 20:30.384
I don't know who you saw last week.
Well, let me help you.

20:30.461 --> 20:34.192
- I'm sure I have it. Hold on.
- Could I have your attention for a moment, please?

20:34.265 --> 20:36.460
It's right here. Look at it.

20:41.105 --> 20:44.040
This is a student visa now.
It's not about a green card anymore.

20:44.108 --> 20:47.805
- It's completely different.
- It's not a menu, Miss Kreutz.

20:47.879 --> 20:49.870
You don'tjust pick what you want.

20:58.756 --> 21:02.283
You! Red bag! The red bag!
Stop right there!

21:02.360 --> 21:04.294
Put your hands up.!

21:41.799 --> 21:43.767
I'm on the east... Ohh!

21:49.240 --> 21:52.004
Move it.! Now.! Now.!

22:10.995 --> 22:12.622
Check. Clear!

22:12.697 --> 22:16.064
Bravo Unit moving up staircase.
Proceeding to second floor.

22:40.525 --> 22:43.653
On the floor! Down!

22:43.728 --> 22:45.389
Clear.!

24:10.948 --> 24:12.677
Go.! Go.! Come on.!

25:17.982 --> 25:22.476
He's in Zurich now?
Right now? Yes. It just came in.

25:22.553 --> 25:24.783
But they're sure? Sure it's him?
Yes. He went to the bank.

25:24.855 --> 25:26.789
Our source at the bank,
that's who called.

25:26.857 --> 25:29.883
- Come on.
- He's got to assume we're watching the bank, right?

25:29.961 --> 25:32.725
I don't know. Come on.

25:32.797 --> 25:35.994
I mean, he cleaned out the box.
He left the gun. What does that mean?

25:36.067 --> 25:38.001
I said I don't know.

25:38.069 --> 25:40.594
I liked it better
when I thought he was dead.

25:50.848 --> 25:52.839
Oh, Scheise.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.956
What are you looking at?

25:59.023 --> 26:01.617
I heard you inside.
What?

26:01.692 --> 26:05.321
The consulate. I heard you talking.
I thought maybe we could help each other.

26:05.396 --> 26:09.298
How's that?
You need money. I need a ride out ofhere.

26:10.635 --> 26:12.569
I'm not running a car service
just now. Thank you.

26:12.637 --> 26:15.231
I'll give you $10,000
for driving me to Paris.

26:23.547 --> 26:25.777
What is this, a joke?
Some kind of scam?

26:25.850 --> 26:28.250
No, it's no scam.

26:28.319 --> 26:30.344
And I'll give you another ten
when we get there.

26:31.422 --> 26:33.754
Jesus.

26:39.030 --> 26:42.363
- Is that for you?
- Look. You drive, I pay. It's that simple.

26:45.436 --> 26:48.428
Scheise.
I got enough trouble, okay?

26:49.507 --> 26:51.839
Okay. Can I have
my money back?

27:07.858 --> 27:12.454
All right, go.
Keep going. Go.

27:12.530 --> 27:15.226
There. Wait.
- No. It's got to be near the end.

27:15.299 --> 27:17.824
Oh, come on, folks.
We caught a break here. Let's go.

27:17.902 --> 27:22.532
Okay, I'm up. We're getting grids.
Airline, train, hotels...

27:22.606 --> 27:24.836
Did you get the address?
The street? Gemeinschaft.

27:24.909 --> 27:27.343
- Here we go.
- I got it. I think I got it.

27:27.411 --> 27:30.437
Is it him?
Unreal.

27:30.514 --> 27:32.607
This is 38 minutes ago.

27:32.683 --> 27:35.709
Hey, Zurich police are looking
for an American man carrying a red bank bag.

27:35.786 --> 27:38.914
Hejust tore up the embassy, and he put two cops
in the hospital last night.

27:42.193 --> 27:44.889
Get everybody up. Do it now.
I want them all activated.

27:44.962 --> 27:46.896
All of them?
At the same time?

27:46.964 --> 27:51.594
You heard me. I want Bourne
in a body bag by sundown.

27:51.669 --> 27:55.969
Let's get a map up here.
Come on, folks. Work it.

27:58.709 --> 28:00.700
Take a look.
The grids are good info.

29:17.822 --> 29:20.416
Which was fine for me,
because I was ready.

29:20.491 --> 29:23.016
You know, because, I mean,
after six months in Amsterdam...

29:23.093 --> 29:26.290
you're not sure if you've been there 20 minutes or 20 years,
if you know what I mean.

29:26.363 --> 29:28.524
So I went and I took
all the money I had...

29:28.599 --> 29:32.558
and I went in with friends and we took over
this really cool surf shop outside Biarritz...

29:32.636 --> 29:36.003
um, which was right by the water
it was amazing.

29:36.073 --> 29:38.598
It was just amazing
for about three months...

29:38.676 --> 29:42.635
until it turned out that this,
uh, jerk who had found us the lease...

29:42.713 --> 29:47.707
was actually shining everyone on and...

29:51.922 --> 29:53.913
And what?

29:55.025 --> 29:56.959
What do you mean what?
Listen to me.

29:57.027 --> 29:59.587
I've been speed-talking
for about 60 kilometers now.

29:59.663 --> 30:02.860
I talk when I'm nervous.
I mean, I talk like this when I'm nervous.

30:02.933 --> 30:05.424
I'm gonna shut up now.
No. Don't do that.

30:07.104 --> 30:09.572
I haven't talked to anybody in a while.

30:10.774 --> 30:13.299
Yeah, but we're not talking.
I'm talking.

30:13.377 --> 30:15.607
You've said, like, ten words
since we left Zurich.

30:15.679 --> 30:18.739
Well, listening to you,
um, it's relaxing.

30:21.552 --> 30:23.747
I haven't slept
in a while and...

30:23.821 --> 30:26.915
and I've had this headache.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.925
It's like a constant thing
inside my head.

30:28.993 --> 30:31.393
And it's just starting
to move to the background, so...

30:32.763 --> 30:35.391
keep going.

30:35.466 --> 30:37.525
Really. If you want,
please keep talking.

30:43.407 --> 30:45.375
What kind of music do you like?

30:47.244 --> 30:49.371
Huh? What do you like? Come on.
Um...

30:51.448 --> 30:54.281
You know what, never mind.
No. It's fine. Tell me.

30:54.351 --> 30:56.819
What do you want
to listen to?

30:56.887 --> 31:00.323
I don't know. Come on.
It's not that hard.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.518
What do you like?
Tell me.

31:02.593 --> 31:04.584
I don't know.

31:14.471 --> 31:17.065
Who pays $20,000 for a ride to Paris?

31:27.384 --> 31:32.822
Fuck it. I can't remember anything
that happened before two weeks ago.

31:34.325 --> 31:36.316
Lucky you.
No. I'm serious.

31:37.895 --> 31:41.296
I don't know who I am. I don't know
where I'm going. None of it.

31:41.365 --> 31:44.926
What, like, amnesia?
Yes.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.164
Amnesia?
Yes.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.068
Great.

32:01.185 --> 32:05.281
- That's the best angle of the courtyard?
- That's the only angle.

32:05.356 --> 32:08.223
Well, what do they have
of the streets or the area?

32:08.292 --> 32:10.385
They must have something.
Hang on.

32:12.730 --> 32:14.857
Oh, what is he doing?

32:16.266 --> 32:19.258
Is it a game? Is he warning us?
Is it a threat?

32:20.537 --> 32:22.528
Sir, look at this.

32:24.274 --> 32:27.004
What's that? It's an angle of the street.
It's some sort of alley.

32:27.077 --> 32:31.309
Just enhance it.

32:34.218 --> 32:36.982
Who the hell is that?

32:37.054 --> 32:39.784
Marie Helena Kreutz.

32:39.857 --> 32:41.984
She's 26.
Born outside of Hannover.

32:42.059 --> 32:44.493
Father was a welder.
He died in '87.

32:44.561 --> 32:46.358
Still don't have the mother.

32:46.430 --> 32:48.489
The grandmother,
she's still there in Hannover...

32:48.565 --> 32:51.830
and looks like she's the anchor
for this little domestic disaster.

32:51.902 --> 32:55.861
And there's a stepbrother.
It's tough. The girl's a gypsy.

32:55.939 --> 33:00.205
She pops up on the grid here and there,
but it's chaotic at best.

33:00.277 --> 33:02.802
She paid some electric bills
in Spain, '95...

33:02.880 --> 33:06.873
had a phone in her name for
three months in Belgium, '96.

33:06.950 --> 33:09.077
No taxes, no credit.

33:09.153 --> 33:12.645
I don't like her.
I want to go deep.

33:12.723 --> 33:15.556
Get a phone log for granny
and the half brother...

33:15.626 --> 33:17.924
anybody we can cross-file.

33:17.995 --> 33:21.362
I want to know every place
she's slept in the past six years.

33:21.432 --> 33:24.333
Have Paris get these
out in the field.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.160
I'm not making this up.

33:55.232 --> 33:57.564
These are real.

34:04.408 --> 34:08.071
Okay. Who has a safety
deposit box full of...

34:10.981 --> 34:13.176
money and six passports
and a gun?

34:15.886 --> 34:18.946
Who has a bank account number
in their hip?

34:20.090 --> 34:22.058
I come in here...

34:22.126 --> 34:25.891
and the first thing I'm doing is I'm catching
the sight lines and looking for an exit.

34:25.963 --> 34:28.056
I see the exit sign too.
I'm not worried.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.464
I mean, you were shot.

34:30.534 --> 34:34.971
People do all kinds of weird and
amazing stuff when they're scared.

34:40.677 --> 34:44.010
I can tell you the license plate numbers
of all six cars outside.

34:45.215 --> 34:47.149
I can tell that
our waitress is left-handed...

34:47.217 --> 34:51.585
and the guy sitting up at the counter
weighs 215 pounds and knows how to handle himself.

34:51.655 --> 34:55.250
I know the best place to look for
a gun is the cab of the gray truck outside.

34:55.324 --> 35:00.126
And at this altitude, I can run flat-out
for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.093
Now why would I know that?

35:08.105 --> 35:10.096
How can I know that
and not know who I am?

35:52.516 --> 35:54.984
Hey.

35:56.253 --> 35:58.244
Ah, I slept.

35:59.723 --> 36:02.214
I can't believe it.
Yeah. Well, you were tired.

36:02.292 --> 36:07.059
I haven't slept. Oh. Here. For 20,000,
I like to throw in breakfast.

36:09.199 --> 36:11.133
Did you stop for gas?

36:13.770 --> 36:15.965
You were
pretty out of it.

36:16.039 --> 36:18.507
Yeah.
Ohh.

36:20.677 --> 36:24.841
So, do you think there's,
like, a family waiting for you?

36:26.516 --> 36:28.507
I don't know.

36:29.553 --> 36:32.249
I haven't
thought about it.

36:39.730 --> 36:41.664
Is that it?

36:41.732 --> 36:44.462
One-o-four.
Yeah, that's it. That's the address.

36:44.534 --> 36:47.196
No, no. Keep going.
Keep going. Okay.

36:47.271 --> 36:50.001
Where? Just, uh, just take a left.
Go on over here.

37:05.289 --> 37:08.622
So this is it, right?
Yeah. I guess.

37:10.661 --> 37:13.528
Yeah, but I don't
recognize any of this.

37:13.597 --> 37:15.588
Okay. You should go.

37:19.770 --> 37:22.295
Jason.

37:23.373 --> 37:25.898
Oh, God. Money. Right.

37:26.910 --> 37:30.038
Yeah.
Here.

37:30.113 --> 37:32.479
Danke, okay?

37:32.549 --> 37:34.983
Thanks for the ride.

37:35.052 --> 37:37.043
Anytime.

37:42.859 --> 37:45.657
Well, you could come up and you can...
Or you could wait here.

37:45.729 --> 37:50.166
I can go check it out, but you could wait...
Uh, no, no. No, no.

37:50.233 --> 37:55.637
Um, with you, you would probably just forget
about me if I stayed here.

37:57.708 --> 38:00.734
How could I forget about you?

38:00.811 --> 38:02.745
You're the only person I know.

38:07.050 --> 38:10.144
Yeah. That's true.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.459
I guess you're not home.

39:02.839 --> 39:04.830
Hello?

39:23.560 --> 39:26.529
You sure this is all yours?

39:26.596 --> 39:30.498
I guess.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.345
This is my kitchen.

40:09.706 --> 40:13.972
- Any clues?
- I think I'm in the shipping business.

40:14.044 --> 40:16.035
So it's all coming back, huh?

40:22.185 --> 40:24.813
Do you mind if I use the bathroom?

40:26.289 --> 40:29.452
- Uh, sure.
- Okay.

40:53.416 --> 40:56.146
Uh, yeah. Hello? Hello?

40:56.219 --> 40:59.916
Yes, sir. Hotel Regina, Paris.
How may I direct your call?

40:59.990 --> 41:02.618
Yeah. You're in Paris?
Yes, sir.

41:02.692 --> 41:05.752
I'm looking for a, uh, guest there.

41:05.829 --> 41:09.094
Uh, Jason Bourne.
- One moment, please.

41:09.166 --> 41:11.157
Thank you.

41:15.238 --> 41:18.207
I'm afraid I have no one
by that name registered, sir.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.444
Uh, okay. Uh, thank you.

41:22.512 --> 41:25.845
Uh, wait. No, no, no.
Uh, are you there? Hello? Sir?

41:25.916 --> 41:28.851
Uh, can you check another,
uh, name for me, please?

41:28.919 --> 41:30.784
Uh, bear with me one second.

41:32.055 --> 41:34.523
Um...

41:34.591 --> 41:37.287
uh, John Michael Kane.
Kane with a "K."

41:37.360 --> 41:39.521
One moment, sir.
Thank you.

41:48.371 --> 41:51.738
You call about Monsieur Kane?
John Michael Kane?

41:51.808 --> 41:55.244
Uh, yeah. That's right.
You are a friend of his?

41:55.312 --> 41:58.145
Uh, uh-huh. Yep.

41:58.215 --> 42:00.445
I have some very
bad news for you, sir.

42:00.517 --> 42:02.485
I'm terribly sorry
to tell you this...

42:02.552 --> 42:06.283
but Monsieur Kane
has passed away almost two weeks ago.

42:06.356 --> 42:09.223
There was an accident on the motorway.

42:09.292 --> 42:11.852
Apparently,
he was killed instantly.

42:11.928 --> 42:14.658
Really. I'm terribly sorry
to be the one to tell you this.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.530
When they came for his things,
people made note for us, you see?

42:20.604 --> 42:23.732
- Who-Who came?
- His brother.

42:23.807 --> 42:27.709
Did his, uh, brother leave a number or
a way to get in touch with him?

42:27.777 --> 42:30.177
I think not.

42:30.247 --> 42:32.715
So I'm sorry...

42:53.403 --> 42:56.099
Uh, Jason?

42:56.172 --> 42:59.141
There's no hot water.
It's freezing.

42:59.209 --> 43:02.337
Uh, I'll go, uh, try
the water in the kitchen.

43:02.412 --> 43:06.439
Why don't you just stay in the bathroom?
I'll-I'll see if I can... get it hot.

43:10.520 --> 43:12.750
Yeah, it's really cold in here too.

43:23.533 --> 43:25.797
The water is still cold.

43:27.203 --> 43:29.728
Yeah, it's cold
in the, uh, kitchen too.

43:29.806 --> 43:32.172
I got it running though.

43:34.210 --> 43:36.201
So...

43:42.452 --> 43:44.443
What?

43:46.323 --> 43:49.315
Nothing.

43:49.392 --> 43:53.021
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

44:06.810 --> 44:10.712
What is it?
Something wrong?

44:47.984 --> 44:49.212
Jason!

45:51.314 --> 45:54.647
Open that! Open that! Tell me what's inside.
Who are you?

45:56.453 --> 45:58.444
Who are you?

45:59.989 --> 46:03.152
Who are you?

46:04.227 --> 46:06.627
Oh, my God.

46:06.696 --> 46:10.826
Ohh.

46:10.900 --> 46:13.266
Answer me! Who are you?

46:13.336 --> 46:15.133
- He's got my picture.
- All right. Just... stop.

46:15.205 --> 46:17.070
No, no, no!

46:17.140 --> 46:20.041
I don't... How... Where did you get this?
Stay there! Stay there!

46:20.109 --> 46:22.236
How did you get my picture?
Marie, stay there. Come on.

46:22.312 --> 46:25.577
Where did you get this from?
How did you get...

46:25.648 --> 46:29.414
Don't do this. I'll do this.
You stay there. Stay there.

46:29.486 --> 46:31.147
But he...

46:45.602 --> 46:47.536
Where are your shoes?
Get your shoes.

46:47.604 --> 46:50.004
Sure. Yeah. Sure.

46:50.073 --> 46:53.338
Uh, he went out the window.
Why would someone do that?

46:53.409 --> 46:56.310
We can't stay here.
It's not safe.

46:56.379 --> 46:59.212
Look, I can get us out ofhere,
but we got to go. We got to go right now.

47:02.418 --> 47:05.148
Okay. Look, uh, you could wait.

47:05.221 --> 47:07.781
You could wait for the cops.
It's okay.

47:07.857 --> 47:10.883
You just wait for them to get here, but I can't.
I got to go.

47:10.960 --> 47:14.623
Marie?

47:17.333 --> 47:19.324
Marie?

47:25.775 --> 47:27.367
Ohh.! Ohh.!
Quiet. Quiet.

47:39.589 --> 47:42.558
- Don't look.

47:54.737 --> 47:57.604
Code in.
Alpha three-seven-five-zero-nine.

47:59.409 --> 48:01.639
Yeah?

48:07.884 --> 48:10.682
Hang on. Bourne, he went to Paris.
He went to the apartment.

48:10.753 --> 48:14.382
We got him? Tell me.
- He killed our man.

48:14.457 --> 48:16.391
What? In the apartment?
- Yeah.

48:16.459 --> 48:19.986
Well, you got to clean that up.
No, I can't clean it up.

48:20.063 --> 48:22.759
There's a body in the streets.
So?

48:22.832 --> 48:24.766
There's police.
This is Paris.

48:24.834 --> 48:27.268
Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio information as you can.

48:29.872 --> 48:34.707
Okay. You stay here. I'll go find a place
for this money. I'll be back in ten minutes.

50:00.263 --> 50:02.493
Hey. I told you to stay in the car.

50:07.470 --> 50:10.564
Jesus Christ.
I told you to stay in the car.

50:12.208 --> 50:14.802
I needed a drink. I didn't think
you would come back anyway.

50:14.877 --> 50:17.345
You got to go to the cops.
Right now.

50:17.413 --> 50:20.280
You got to go before this gets any worse.
By myself?

50:20.349 --> 50:23.944
It's gonna be okay. Take my passport,
okay? You show this to them.

50:24.020 --> 50:26.011
You have that picture.
You have the 20,000.

50:26.089 --> 50:28.819
You tell them everything that happened.
Everything. They're gonna believe you.

50:28.891 --> 50:30.916
They have to believe you.

50:34.297 --> 50:38.131
Marie, you can't just sit here.
It's not safe here.

50:38.201 --> 50:40.829
Safe? This is from
inside the embassy.

50:40.903 --> 50:42.996
Who can do this? This is from yesterday.
I don't know.

50:43.072 --> 50:45.006
How can they even know
that we're together?

50:45.074 --> 50:47.804
Look, I'm trying to do
the right thing for you, okay? Just...

50:47.877 --> 50:50.107
Try... How are you gonna
make this right...

50:50.179 --> 50:53.205
by sending me there alone?
Do you think I want you to go to the cops?

50:53.282 --> 50:55.250
You think that's good for me?
You want to go, fine.

50:55.318 --> 50:57.548
You go to the cops, I gotta run.
You tell them what happened.

50:57.620 --> 51:00.214
I don't know what happened!
I don't know who this guy was!

51:00.289 --> 51:03.053
I don't know about that picture!
I don't know who I am!

51:10.333 --> 51:13.029
Look, I'm... You're acting like
I'm trying to burn you here.

51:13.102 --> 51:16.663
- I'm just trying to do the right thing.
- Nobody does the right thing.

51:25.148 --> 51:28.379
Look, I can't
run with you. I can't...

51:30.253 --> 51:32.619
We run... I gotta live
like this. I gotta...

51:32.688 --> 51:34.781
I don't even know
who I'm hiding from.

51:34.857 --> 51:37.917
These people know who I am.
Now I gotta...

51:37.994 --> 51:40.292
I gotta stay here.
I gotta figure this out.

51:40.363 --> 51:42.388
So figure it out.

51:59.649 --> 52:02.243
You take care
of this car?

52:02.318 --> 52:05.515
What do you mean?
Tires felt a little splashy on the way over here.

52:06.589 --> 52:08.682
It pulls a little to the right.

52:30.279 --> 52:32.270
Last chance, Marie.

53:55.798 --> 53:57.857
So...
What?

53:57.934 --> 54:00.402
uh, we got a bump
coming up.

54:33.569 --> 54:35.901
Turn your head away.
Turn your head away.

55:53.382 --> 55:56.818
Ohh!

56:47.269 --> 56:49.635
You can never
come back to this car.

56:49.705 --> 56:51.639
You understand?
Mm-hmm.

56:51.707 --> 56:55.643
Okay. We're gonna clean it out
and I'll wipe it down and we walk away.

56:55.711 --> 56:57.645
That's it. Okay.
Okay.

56:57.713 --> 57:01.410
And I'll find a place for us to rest,
and I gotta think.

57:01.484 --> 57:03.975
Do you have a hat or a scarf
or something? For my hair?

57:04.053 --> 57:06.146
Yeah. Just until we can change it.

57:06.222 --> 57:08.656
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
Okay.

57:15.831 --> 57:19.767
Shh.! Shush.! Shh.!
Hush up.

57:19.835 --> 57:21.860
Shh.! Shh.!

57:26.075 --> 57:28.600
Monsieur Kane.
Monsieur Kane.

57:28.677 --> 57:30.872
Ah, Monsieur Kane.

57:47.363 --> 57:49.354
It's not him.

58:10.119 --> 58:14.556
What do you have?

58:14.623 --> 58:16.716
Wombosi went to the morgue.

58:16.792 --> 58:19.454
He saw the body.
He didn't buy it.

58:20.563 --> 58:22.497
Where is he now?

58:22.565 --> 58:25.193
I told you I'm not staffed for this.

58:25.267 --> 58:27.462
Where is he now?
Right now, where's Wombosi?

58:27.536 --> 58:29.834
They were leaving the morgue.
Theyjust left.

58:37.179 --> 58:39.170
Sir, what do you want to do?

01:00:37.694 --> 01:00:40.219
I need to get that pile.

01:02:10.587 --> 01:02:12.578
Hey.

01:02:22.832 --> 01:02:25.494
You've already cleaned the room?

01:02:25.568 --> 01:02:29.766
I wiped the whole place down for
fingerprints.

01:02:32.141 --> 01:02:36.043
Can I walk around or is that gonna leave any
footprints?

01:02:42.252 --> 01:02:44.948
You can... walk around. It's no problem.

01:02:46.289 --> 01:02:49.224
But we'll just keep track of everything we touch.

01:02:49.292 --> 01:02:52.693
I just think
it's better if we leave a room that we're
not gonna leave a trail.

01:02:52.762 --> 01:02:57.358
Why? Where are we going? I need to go to the
hotel where John Michael Kane stayed...

01:02:57.433 --> 01:02:59.367
the Hotel Regina.

01:02:59.435 --> 01:03:01.903
Um, if I was him...

01:03:01.971 --> 01:03:03.962
then they're gonna have some records.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.873
We need that hotel bill. Okay.

01:03:06.943 --> 01:03:09.241
It gets slightly complicated though.

01:03:10.914 --> 01:03:12.905
Because you're dead.

01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:17.418
Right.

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:22.517
- Sir, please. - They want war?

01:03:22.592 --> 01:03:27.188
Then we will give them war. If they want to
kill me, they better kill me the first time.

01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:29.197
They better kill me dead.

01:03:29.265 --> 01:03:32.200
- They better kill me in my sleep. -
Nykwana, listen to me.

01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:35.829
We need these people. It's hard enough getting people we know to help us.

01:03:35.905 --> 01:03:39.272
We need to be careful. - We?

01:03:39.342 --> 01:03:43.039
No, you. You need to bring me back that
bastard Kane's head...

01:03:43.112 --> 01:03:47.446
put it in front of this house and show them
what kind of war we are fighting.

01:04:07.203 --> 01:04:09.728
I want a reference check before we go.

01:04:11.474 --> 01:04:13.465
Okay.

01:04:15.044 --> 01:04:16.978
What's the pay phone number?

01:04:17.046 --> 01:04:20.072
616-2 468.

01:04:20.149 --> 01:04:22.879
Exits? There's three.

01:04:22.952 --> 01:04:27.286
Service at the back, um, side goes to the
street past the shops.

01:04:27.357 --> 01:04:29.291
Front is the best.

01:04:29.359 --> 01:04:33.159
If I think I'm being followed, I walk out with the bag over my right shoulder.

01:04:33.229 --> 01:04:36.130
And if there's no taxi? I keep on walking...

01:04:36.199 --> 01:04:38.429
don't look back until you make contact.

01:04:41.671 --> 01:04:43.605
What?

01:04:46.643 --> 01:04:48.577
We need this, right?

01:04:50.513 --> 01:04:52.674
Okay.

01:05:03.593 --> 01:05:06.721
I need distances.

01:05:06.796 --> 01:05:09.629
You walk in, you pick a spot... some
midpoint in the lobby.

01:05:09.699 --> 01:05:13.533
I want you to count your steps to that spot
and then remember that number.

01:05:13.603 --> 01:05:16.697
Because after I call you, I can get you
moving. You understand?

01:05:16.773 --> 01:05:21.369
I also need a head count from the time you
walk in until you get to the desk.

01:05:21.444 --> 01:05:24.345
How many hotel employees are there? And
obviously security.

01:05:24.414 --> 01:05:27.349
And it might not be that easy to see who
they are.

01:05:27.417 --> 01:05:30.716
I'll call you. You give me the layout. We'll
take it from there.

01:05:57.313 --> 01:06:00.373
What happened? Did something go wrong?

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:03.544
I've got the records.

01:06:03.619 --> 01:06:06.179
This guy at the front desk was smiling at me.

01:06:06.255 --> 01:06:09.486
I thought... all this trouble... maybe it's easier to just ask for them.

01:06:09.559 --> 01:06:11.493
Do you have the bill?

01:06:11.561 --> 01:06:14.724
He made me a photocopy.

01:06:14.797 --> 01:06:17.630
You just asked for it?

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:22.569
I said I was Mr. Kane's personal assistant.

01:06:22.638 --> 01:06:24.572
Oh.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.599
Okay. Good thinking.

01:06:36.686 --> 01:06:40.087
Reschedule a meeting... Sir, can l...

01:06:43.059 --> 01:06:47.086
Wombosi was assassinated in his house in the
middle of Paris.

01:06:47.163 --> 01:06:49.097
Yeah, we just heard.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.094
It's him. It's Bourne. We're almost positive.

01:06:53.169 --> 01:06:55.763
He had an assignment. He failed.

01:06:55.838 --> 01:06:58.102
He obviously felt compelled to finish the
task.

01:06:58.174 --> 01:07:01.610
Shit. Jesus. We think he'll come back in now.

01:07:01.677 --> 01:07:06.239
I mean, it's routine. It's like behavioral
software.

01:07:07.784 --> 01:07:10.150
He's following a protocol.

01:07:10.219 --> 01:07:13.916
Now that
he's completed the mission, we think he'll
come back in.

01:07:14.991 --> 01:07:17.789
They always do. - When?

01:07:19.028 --> 01:07:21.826
How long till he checks in?

01:07:21.898 --> 01:07:23.832
Twenty-four hours. - Twenty-four hours?

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:26.391
Yeah. It's usually something like that.

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:30.337
Then what?

01:07:30.406 --> 01:07:32.601
I told you we'd clean this up.

01:07:32.675 --> 01:07:34.165
It will be clean.

01:07:37.847 --> 01:07:42.307
I understand you're a dive shop, but where are you located?

01:07:42.385 --> 01:07:44.319
Marseilles?

01:08:08.845 --> 01:08:13.009
What specifically does your company supply?
I am sorry...

01:08:13.082 --> 01:08:15.175
what did you say your name was, monsieur?

01:08:35.404 --> 01:08:37.395
What? The Paris police found the vehicle.

01:08:50.419 --> 01:08:53.081
You've reached the office of Simon Rawlins...

01:08:53.154 --> 01:08:55.645
at Alliance Securite, Maritime Division.

01:08:55.725 --> 01:08:59.319
The Paris office hours are from 8:00 a.m. to
5:00 p.m.

01:08:59.395 --> 01:09:02.296
I got a lead in Paris.

01:09:02.365 --> 01:09:05.801
The rest were Marseilles and... In Paris it's what?

01:09:05.868 --> 01:09:08.666
Uh, Alliance Securite. Simon Rawlins. I got
a machine.

01:09:30.826 --> 01:09:32.760
Monsieur.

01:09:32.828 --> 01:09:35.388
Mr. Kane?

01:09:35.464 --> 01:09:38.865
Mr. Kane.

01:09:38.935 --> 01:09:42.301
How are you? - I'm good. I'm good. How are
you?

01:09:46.943 --> 01:09:48.808
Oh, Mr. Kane. Come right in.

01:09:48.877 --> 01:09:51.779
Please, have a seat. Thank you.

01:09:51.846 --> 01:09:55.112
So, this is the PalmerJohnson tri-deck.

01:09:55.184 --> 01:09:58.915
I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's still the same vessel.

01:09:58.988 --> 01:10:01.252
Yes.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.414
So I'm Kane.

01:10:26.482 --> 01:10:28.473
Hey. I just had a meeting as Kane.

01:10:28.551 --> 01:10:31.850
They said...No. I'm definitely Kane. I just had a meeting as Kane.

01:10:31.921 --> 01:10:36.187
And he knew me as Kane. So
I'm definitely Bourne. I'm also definitely
Kane.

01:10:36.258 --> 01:10:39.386
This is all just boats. I got blueprints and
cameras.

01:10:39.462 --> 01:10:42.863
I just found John Michael Kane's body.

01:10:42.932 --> 01:10:45.162
In a morgue here in Paris.

01:10:45.234 --> 01:10:50.262
But if you areJohn Michael Kane, whose body
do they have?

01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:00.515
What was name again? - Kane.

01:11:00.583 --> 01:11:02.744
Kane. John Michael Kane.

01:11:02.818 --> 01:11:04.911
John Michael Kane.

01:11:09.759 --> 01:11:13.217
Kane. It's number 121.

01:11:13.295 --> 01:11:16.128
- I want to see the body. - Our boss could
come back.

01:11:16.198 --> 01:11:19.224
I'm not supposed to do that.

01:11:19.301 --> 01:11:21.496
Come on.

01:11:35.785 --> 01:11:38.982
Is this it? Wh-Where is he?

01:11:39.055 --> 01:11:41.421
l... I don't know where.

01:11:49.832 --> 01:11:52.596
Who are you? What's going on here? Where's
the body?

01:11:52.668 --> 01:11:55.831
I said someone came last night. I know.
Where'd they take the body?

01:11:55.905 --> 01:11:57.930
Look, this is not a carnival, okay?

01:11:58.007 --> 01:12:00.737
People call. They make an appointment and
they follow the rules.

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:04.041
Everyone signs in and out. This is a serious
place...serious work.

01:12:04.113 --> 01:12:08.209
It's not just to come in whenever you like! You're
right. We didn't sign in.

01:12:08.284 --> 01:12:10.218
Get the hell out ofhere.

01:12:10.286 --> 01:12:13.585
Fine, fine. I'm just gonna go sign in. Go.

01:12:16.192 --> 01:12:18.524
Is this it? This is it, right?

01:12:18.594 --> 01:12:21.825
You can't take the book. It's okay. There's a pencil in here.

01:12:21.897 --> 01:12:24.058
Honey, why don't you go wait outside?

01:12:24.133 --> 01:12:27.330
Oh, here it is. We cannot have...Excuse me.

01:12:28.337 --> 01:12:30.897
Jason, what just happened in there?

01:12:30.973 --> 01:12:33.464
What are you looking for? - Nykwana Wombosi.

01:12:33.542 --> 01:12:38.138
Wombosi went to the morgue to visit Kane.

01:12:38.214 --> 01:12:40.148
See? So?

01:12:40.216 --> 01:12:44.152
So, look. He's in the Alliance Securite brochure. Same guy.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.381
This guy knows.

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.811
My French sucks. I can't...

01:13:19.889 --> 01:13:24.349
It says something about a boat or...

01:13:24.426 --> 01:13:27.554
I don't understand. What does it say? You read it.

01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:30.497
Huh? Tell me. Wha...

01:13:30.566 --> 01:13:32.966
It says that three weeks before he was
killed...

01:13:33.035 --> 01:13:36.937
Mr. Wombosi told police that a man came on
to his yacht...

01:13:37.006 --> 01:13:40.339
five miles off the coast of Marseilles and
tried to kill him.

01:13:40.409 --> 01:13:44.778
It says that he chased the man off the boat
and shot him twice in the back.

01:13:46.115 --> 01:13:48.640
It says I'm an assassin.

01:14:36.432 --> 01:14:39.230
What's going on?

01:14:39.301 --> 01:14:42.270
What are you doing?

01:14:42.338 --> 01:14:44.898
Go. Go.

01:14:44.974 --> 01:14:48.102
We're blown. Come on. Blown? What is "blown"?

01:14:54.984 --> 01:14:57.612
Ow. Keep walking. Keep walking.

01:14:57.686 --> 01:15:00.655
What do you
thinkthey're doing there? They're onto the
hotel.

01:15:00.723 --> 01:15:03.783
No, you don't know that. Trust me. Just keep walking.

01:15:24.847 --> 01:15:27.315
Are you crazy? What are you doing now?

01:15:29.285 --> 01:15:31.219
Jason!

01:15:31.287 --> 01:15:33.278
This. This is "blown."

01:15:40.663 --> 01:15:42.597
Marie. Get away.

01:15:42.665 --> 01:15:44.895
Marie, stop. Get away from me.

01:15:44.967 --> 01:15:46.992
Stop. What are you gonna do, kill me?

01:15:47.069 --> 01:15:49.299
Is that what's next? Listen... Stay calm. Stay calm.

01:15:49.371 --> 01:15:54.001
Whatever we do, we have to do it together.
We?

01:15:54.076 --> 01:15:57.739
The only thing we had in common was that
neither of us knew who you were.

01:15:57.813 --> 01:15:59.747
We passed that now. Marie, listen to me!

01:15:59.815 --> 01:16:03.114
The police will find us, and the people who
took that picture in the embassy...

01:16:03.185 --> 01:16:05.676
the people who killed Wombosi... they are
gonna kill us.

01:16:05.754 --> 01:16:07.813
The people who you work for.

01:16:09.058 --> 01:16:11.458
I will take you wherever you need to go.

01:16:11.527 --> 01:16:13.518
I will take you there. I will leave you
there.

01:16:13.595 --> 01:16:15.790
You can do whatever you want. You never have
to see me again.

01:16:15.864 --> 01:16:20.801
But not here. If we stay here, we die.

01:16:26.275 --> 01:16:30.803
Great police work. Really brilliant.

01:16:30.879 --> 01:16:35.441
Why
don't they justhang out a banner that says "Don't
come back"?

01:16:35.517 --> 01:16:40.045
Jesus Christ. What is the French word for
stakeout, huh?

01:16:43.926 --> 01:16:46.690
Hmm.

01:16:46.762 --> 01:16:49.822
Okay. This was 16 minutes ago.

01:16:49.898 --> 01:16:51.832
This is our starting point.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:55.336
They can't fly. Trains are risky. Nicky? - Yes.

01:16:55.404 --> 01:17:00.569
I need to know everything
Paris's finest is doing on this. - I'm on it.

01:17:00.642 --> 01:17:04.578
You said 2 4 hours, and he's not back.

01:17:06.148 --> 01:17:09.345
No. We've got a good idea where he is.

01:17:09.418 --> 01:17:12.649
You've got a black ops agent who's off the
reservation.

01:17:12.721 --> 01:17:16.555
He's trashed an American consulate. He's on
the run in Europe. You don't know why.

01:17:16.625 --> 01:17:20.152
I've gotta stand before an oversight committee. What am I gonna tell 'em
about Treadstone?

01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:22.754
You're worried about a budget meeting?

01:17:22.831 --> 01:17:26.733
We don't take care of this, we don't make it
to the men's room.

01:17:26.802 --> 01:17:28.736
Is that clear enough for you?

01:17:28.804 --> 01:17:32.205
We will burn for this.

01:17:32.274 --> 01:17:34.265
We will both of us burn.

01:17:35.844 --> 01:17:39.439
I want two teams. Daryl, Ray, stay on the
grids.

01:17:39.515 --> 01:17:41.779
Brian, Harris, Steve...

01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:45.684
I want to work on this girl. Where do we
stand with this residency pattern?

01:17:45.754 --> 01:17:48.279
- Uh, we started it. - Get it out.

01:17:52.528 --> 01:17:55.964
We cross-referenced numbers from the
grandmother and the stepbrother.

01:17:56.031 --> 01:17:59.967
Whenever we found convergence, we back-
checked those numbers and ran a search
merge...

01:18:00.035 --> 01:18:03.027
with any other data we had on her, which
wasn't much, but...

01:18:03.105 --> 01:18:07.371
These pins. These are all the places we
think she's lived in the last six years.

01:18:07.443 --> 01:18:12.107
One, two, three, four, five. That's our pool.

01:18:17.653 --> 01:18:21.646
No answer. How many times did you let it
ring?

01:18:21.723 --> 01:18:24.089
Look, if you don't wanna go, I'll hitch.

01:18:24.159 --> 01:18:26.923
I said I'd take you.

01:18:26.995 --> 01:18:29.429
Those are the targets.

01:18:29.498 --> 01:18:32.797
Beg, borrow, hack, tap, bypass...

01:18:32.868 --> 01:18:35.462
I don't care what you do.

01:18:35.537 --> 01:18:39.735
I want to know everything you can tell me
about what's going on at those locations.

01:18:57.593 --> 01:18:59.925
How do you know he still owns this?

01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:04.957
Eamon always had money. He would never sell
this.

01:19:22.618 --> 01:19:24.609
Scheise.

01:19:34.496 --> 01:19:37.090
- Marie. - What?

01:19:38.834 --> 01:19:40.893
We gotta go.

01:19:40.969 --> 01:19:44.097
What? - We gotta go.

01:19:44.172 --> 01:19:46.663
Oh, Scheise.

01:19:46.742 --> 01:19:49.609
I thought...

01:19:52.481 --> 01:19:55.575
Oh, shit. That's Eamon.

01:19:55.651 --> 01:19:57.585
I'll talk to him. We're leaving.

01:20:01.023 --> 01:20:03.150
Eamon. Hey.

01:20:03.225 --> 01:20:05.159
Surprise. It's me... Marie.

01:20:05.227 --> 01:20:07.161
Wow, uh, God...

01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:10.323
There's a really good reason for this.

01:20:10.399 --> 01:20:12.333
There bloody well better be.

01:20:12.401 --> 01:20:14.767
Daddy! Hang on. Just hang on.

01:20:16.104 --> 01:20:18.402
I had no idea you would be here.

01:20:18.473 --> 01:20:23.308
Well, why would I be here? It's only my bloody house, right?

01:20:23.378 --> 01:20:27.212
Yeah. Did she get you into this?

01:20:29.017 --> 01:20:31.178
It was just gonna be for a day.

01:20:31.253 --> 01:20:34.279
Daddy, Alan has to go to pee.

01:20:34.356 --> 01:20:37.484
All right. Come on. Get out of the car.

01:20:40.596 --> 01:20:43.429
Come on, Alan.

01:20:43.498 --> 01:20:45.762
I'm sorry. I thought it was... would be okay.

01:20:45.834 --> 01:20:47.768
But I guess I was wrong.

01:20:47.836 --> 01:20:51.272
Let's find Mummy. Mummy is away for two days, thank God.

01:20:57.012 --> 01:21:00.413
You've got yourself all tied up. Okay.

01:21:03.151 --> 01:21:06.518
What's he do for a living?

01:21:07.522 --> 01:21:10.923
He used to be in shipping. Uh-huh.

01:21:11.927 --> 01:21:15.727
Is he good for you? Are you happy?

01:21:15.797 --> 01:21:17.924
You know me. I try too hard.

01:21:41.303 --> 01:21:44.431
Here you go.

01:21:44.506 --> 01:21:47.304
Sleep well. Good night.

01:21:48.944 --> 01:21:50.935
I'll sleep on the floor.

01:21:57.152 --> 01:21:59.643
This was when? 11:45 a.m.

01:21:59.721 --> 01:22:03.350
Which is definitely within the driving range
of Paris.

01:22:03.425 --> 01:22:07.589
- The call came from a highway rest stop,
southbound side. - What's this yellow pin?

01:22:07.663 --> 01:22:10.029
She spent a couple of months there in 1997.

01:22:10.098 --> 01:22:12.123
Closest town is Riome.

01:22:13.869 --> 01:22:17.305
We took her family's phone records and collated the international calls.

01:22:17.372 --> 01:22:19.499
They were in Paris at 2:00 a.m.

01:22:19.574 --> 01:22:22.441
They can't fly. Train's too dangerous.

01:22:22.511 --> 01:22:27.005
He knows better than to go anywhere we might
track him. So this is our best guess.

01:23:24.806 --> 01:23:28.503
What are you doing here? The kids...

01:23:28.577 --> 01:23:30.909
I was worried. You're gonna wake them up.

01:23:30.979 --> 01:23:34.506
We gotta... I don't wanna know who I am anymore.

01:23:34.583 --> 01:23:37.848
Shh. I don't care. I don't wanna know.

01:23:39.588 --> 01:23:43.183
Come on. We'll... Everything I found out, I wanna forget.

01:23:43.258 --> 01:23:45.192
It's okay.

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:48.320
I don't care who I am or what I did.

01:23:49.698 --> 01:23:52.861
It's okay. We have this money.

01:23:52.934 --> 01:23:54.925
We can hide.

01:23:57.038 --> 01:24:00.474
Could we do that? Is there any chance you
can do that?

01:24:07.315 --> 01:24:10.580
I don't know.

01:24:14.523 --> 01:24:16.514
Come on.

01:24:23.565 --> 01:24:25.499
Guy. Guy.

01:24:25.567 --> 01:24:27.899
Here, boy.

01:24:27.969 --> 01:24:30.597
Here, boy. Here, boy. Morning.

01:24:30.672 --> 01:24:34.836
Christ, you're up early. Bless you for making coffee.

01:24:42.984 --> 01:24:45.316
One night... you weren't kidding.

01:24:45.387 --> 01:24:47.287
For a change.

01:24:47.355 --> 01:24:51.018
He's not there either.

01:24:51.092 --> 01:24:53.356
You looked by the car? He's not anywhere.

01:24:53.428 --> 01:24:56.454
All right. Let me get dressed.

01:24:56.531 --> 01:24:59.261
Who? Bloody dog's gone missing.

01:24:59.334 --> 01:25:01.268
Does that happen a lot?

01:25:01.336 --> 01:25:03.702
That mutt miss his breakfast? Not a chance.

01:25:03.772 --> 01:25:06.104
It's always something, right?

01:25:07.375 --> 01:25:09.309
Get in the basement.

01:25:09.377 --> 01:25:12.039
What?

01:25:12.113 --> 01:25:15.480
- Get everyone in the basement. - What the
hell are you talking about?

01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:18.644
We're in danger. Your family's in danger. I
don't have time to explain.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.553
- What the... - Eamon, you should go.

01:25:21.623 --> 01:25:24.524
What the hell have you done?
It's not her. It's me.

01:25:24.593 --> 01:25:28.654
You need to get out of sight and in the
basement as quick as you can.

01:25:28.730 --> 01:25:31.324
Daddy.

01:25:34.102 --> 01:25:36.002
I'm sorry.

01:25:36.071 --> 01:25:38.062
Let's go.

01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:57.390
The phone is dead.

01:25:57.459 --> 01:25:59.552
Yeah.

01:25:59.628 --> 01:26:01.687
Jason, who's out there?

01:26:01.763 --> 01:26:03.856
Who is it?

01:26:10.071 --> 01:26:12.369
Scheise. Scheise.

01:26:19.447 --> 01:26:21.915
What are you doing?

01:26:27.856 --> 01:26:30.450
We should never have come here. L... These
children...

01:26:30.525 --> 01:26:32.891
That's not gonna happen.

01:28:58.573 --> 01:29:01.474
Where is it?

01:29:01.543 --> 01:29:04.512
Where's the weapon?

01:29:05.947 --> 01:29:07.881
Who else is out here?

01:29:07.949 --> 01:29:10.850
How many you got with you? I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:29:10.919 --> 01:29:14.377
I work alone, like you.

01:29:16.124 --> 01:29:18.058
We always work alone.

01:29:18.126 --> 01:29:20.788
What do you mean? Who are you? Bonn?

01:29:20.862 --> 01:29:23.330
Paris?

01:29:24.833 --> 01:29:26.858
Treadstone... both of us.

01:29:26.935 --> 01:29:28.869
Treadstone? Which one?

01:29:28.937 --> 01:29:31.770
Paris. I live in Paris. Do you still get the
headaches?

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.774
Yeah.

01:29:33.842 --> 01:29:36.640
I get such bad headaches.

01:29:36.711 --> 01:29:38.975
You know at night when you're driving a car?

01:29:39.047 --> 01:29:41.777
Maybe it's something to do with the headlights. What is Treadstone?

01:29:42.851 --> 01:29:46.548
Treadstone... said, "Pioze..."

01:29:47.555 --> 01:29:49.955
They said, "Go to Paris."

01:29:50.024 --> 01:29:52.492
Is Treadstone in Paris?

01:29:54.028 --> 01:29:56.019
Look at this.

01:29:57.332 --> 01:29:59.323
Look at what they make you give.

01:30:23.992 --> 01:30:26.722
All right. All right. All right. All right.

01:30:26.794 --> 01:30:29.558
Right, get in the front, put your belt on.

01:30:29.631 --> 01:30:31.861
We're just gonna put you in the back.

01:30:31.933 --> 01:30:33.924
Get in the front, Polly.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.432
- I'm not waiting, Marie. - One minute, Eamon.

01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:44.501
I'm not waiting! Please!

01:30:44.579 --> 01:30:46.877
Take it.

01:30:46.948 --> 01:30:50.384
I took out 30 grand. The rest is yours.

01:30:50.451 --> 01:30:53.682
That's it? That's all I got.

01:30:53.755 --> 01:30:56.690
No, that's not what I meant.

01:30:56.758 --> 01:30:59.352
This is not gonna stop, Marie.

01:30:59.427 --> 01:31:02.123
You gotta get out now, away from me.

01:31:03.431 --> 01:31:05.558
You gotta get out. You gotta start running.

01:31:05.633 --> 01:31:07.567
You get low. You stay low.

01:31:07.635 --> 01:31:11.366
No more friends. Nothing familiar.

01:31:11.439 --> 01:31:14.738
There's enough in there for you to make a life.

01:31:14.809 --> 01:31:17.334
Any life. - I'm out ofhere, Marie.

01:31:17.412 --> 01:31:19.403
Hey.

01:31:21.049 --> 01:31:23.040
Get in the car. You gotta go.

01:31:28.456 --> 01:31:31.186
What are you gonna do?

01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:35.195
I'll end it. Go ahead.

01:31:37.131 --> 01:31:39.122
Please.

01:32:56.644 --> 01:32:59.306
Code in, please.

01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:01.507
Code in.

01:33:04.986 --> 01:33:07.454
- Code in.

01:33:09.857 --> 01:33:11.791
Who is this?

01:33:17.732 --> 01:33:20.428
Who the hell are you?

01:33:23.171 --> 01:33:25.105
The man you sent is dead.

01:33:25.173 --> 01:33:27.801
So whoever this is, you better start talking.

01:33:29.344 --> 01:33:31.437
Hello, Jason.

01:33:31.512 --> 01:33:33.742
So what are we into now?

01:33:37.518 --> 01:33:40.419
Come on. It only goes two ways, Jason.

01:33:40.488 --> 01:33:44.652
Come in and let us make thisright, or
we're gonna keep going until we're satisfied.

01:33:44.726 --> 01:33:46.557
You mean until you kill me.

01:33:48.262 --> 01:33:50.890
I can't fix this if I don't know what the
problem is.

01:33:50.965 --> 01:33:54.457
So tell me what we're into, and I'll do the
best I can.

01:34:02.076 --> 01:34:06.103
Why don't you talk to Marie, Jason?

01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:10.014
Let's ask Marie what she wants to do. I don't
think she gives a shit.

01:34:10.084 --> 01:34:12.143
She's dead.

01:34:20.762 --> 01:34:23.424
I'm sorry to hear that. How did that happen?

01:34:23.498 --> 01:34:26.194
She was slowing me down.

01:34:26.267 --> 01:34:29.031
Jason, listen. All we've been doing right from...

01:34:29.103 --> 01:34:31.537
Enough. Enough.

01:34:31.606 --> 01:34:35.940
5:30 p.m. Paris. Today. Pont Neuf.

01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:38.535
You come alone. You walk to the middle of
that bridge.

01:34:38.613 --> 01:34:40.604
You take off yourjacket. Face east.

01:34:40.681 --> 01:34:42.842
I'll redial this number. Jason, wait.

01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:58.020
First flight out. Tell Nicky I'll call from the car. Tell her to find Picot now. Go.

01:35:00.635 --> 01:35:03.229
So... what are we gonna do?

01:35:03.304 --> 01:35:06.273
I told you I'd clean this up. That's what I'm doing.

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:08.433
Can you really bring him in?

01:35:08.509 --> 01:35:11.808
I think we're past that, don't you?

01:35:11.879 --> 01:35:15.781
Do you have a better idea? You've given me nothing but a trail of collateral damage.

01:35:15.850 --> 01:35:18.250
I don't think I could do much worse.

01:35:18.319 --> 01:35:21.345
Why don't you go upstairs and book a conference room?

01:35:21.422 --> 01:35:23.856
Maybe you can talk him to death.

01:36:40.902 --> 01:36:43.564
The bus. The tour bus.

01:36:43.638 --> 01:36:46.368
Negative.

01:36:48.175 --> 01:36:51.633
Position one. - Negative.

01:36:51.712 --> 01:36:53.737
Position two. - Negative.

01:37:09.463 --> 01:37:12.557
Position three... motorcycle.

01:37:12.633 --> 01:37:15.761
Negative.

01:37:35.323 --> 01:37:37.086
En position.

01:37:39.594 --> 01:37:42.461
- Jason? - I told you to come alone.

01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:44.589
I guess that was too complicated.

01:37:44.665 --> 01:37:47.031
So try this... I'm gone.

01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:00.914
- Get Nicky on the phone.

01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:17.564
Yeah.

01:38:17.632 --> 01:38:20.965
How long does it take to wipe the room down
and get it moved?

01:38:21.035 --> 01:38:22.969
- Get rid of everything? - Yeah.

01:38:23.037 --> 01:38:25.665
Two to three hours. All right. Get started.

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.646
Listen, no breaks. Two men outside, one in
the lobby and keep your eyes open.

01:38:40.054 --> 01:38:43.512
- Keep the truck? - Keep the truck. I'm gonna close this unit down.

01:38:43.591 --> 01:38:45.582
We'll move the gear in the truck.

01:39:02.777 --> 01:39:06.873
They were covering Spain, Malta, Morocco.
Yes, all local police radio traffic.

01:39:06.947 --> 01:39:11.008
No. For northern Europe we need an
authorized directive.

01:39:11.085 --> 01:39:16.148
Yeah. Okay. They're on it. We'll have a
satellite download in 30 minutes.

01:40:24.024 --> 01:40:26.458
Where's your field box?

01:40:30.831 --> 01:40:34.028
- Where's your field box? - It's right there.

01:40:34.101 --> 01:40:37.901
The system's gone haywire.

01:40:37.972 --> 01:40:40.236
That's this window right here.

01:40:40.307 --> 01:40:42.571
Dining room window?

01:40:42.643 --> 01:40:45.077
I don't get...

01:40:47.481 --> 01:40:50.575
Dead. The phones are dead.

01:40:50.651 --> 01:40:54.644
It's Bourne, isn't it?

01:40:54.722 --> 01:40:56.713
Just quiet.

01:41:43.370 --> 01:41:45.668
You move, you die.

01:41:45.739 --> 01:41:47.934
- Bourne. - Gun down.

01:41:53.447 --> 01:41:56.348
In there.

01:41:57.685 --> 01:42:00.654
Okay, so what do you want? Treadstone.

01:42:00.721 --> 01:42:02.712
You better take a look around.

01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:04.849
There's not much left. Are you Treadstone?

01:42:04.925 --> 01:42:08.053
Am I Treadstone? Me? What the hell are you
talking about?

01:42:08.128 --> 01:42:10.062
He's lost it.

01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:13.827
You better start filling in the blanks,
cause I thought we were on the same side.

01:42:13.901 --> 01:42:17.564
Who's side is that? You don't know what you're doing, do you, Jason?

01:42:17.638 --> 01:42:21.699
- You don't have a goddamn clue. - Who am I?

01:42:21.775 --> 01:42:23.709
You're U.S. government property.

01:42:23.777 --> 01:42:27.008
You're a malfunctioning, $30-million-dollar weapon.

01:42:27.081 --> 01:42:29.072
You're a total goddamn catastrophe.

01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:33.210
By God, you're gonna tell me how this happened. Why are you trying to kill me?

01:42:33.287 --> 01:42:36.051
- What happened in Marseilles? - Why are you
try...

01:42:36.123 --> 01:42:39.354
You sent me to kill Wombosi. Kill Wombosi?

01:42:39.426 --> 01:42:44.386
We can do that anytime we want. I can send
Nicky to do that, for Christ's sake.

01:42:44.465 --> 01:42:47.195
Mr. Wombosi was supposed to be dead three
weeks ago.

01:42:47.268 --> 01:42:50.931
He was supposed to have died in a way where
the only possible explanation was...

01:42:51.005 --> 01:42:54.099
that he'd been murdered by a member of his own entourage.

01:42:54.174 --> 01:42:57.735
I don't send you to kill. I send you to be invisible.

01:42:57.811 --> 01:42:59.870
I send you because you don't exist.

01:42:59.947 --> 01:43:02.381
I want to know what happened in Marseilles.

01:43:02.449 --> 01:43:05.247
I don't remember what happened in Marseilles.

01:43:05.319 --> 01:43:09.915
Bullshit! This is unacceptable, Soldier. You
hear me? You failed.

01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:12.925
Unacceptable? You failed! You failed, and
you're gonna tell me why.

01:43:12.993 --> 01:43:16.258
I can't tell you. I don't re... You brought
John Michael Kane to life.

01:43:16.330 --> 01:43:19.857
You put together a meeting with Wombosi. You
found the security company.

01:43:19.934 --> 01:43:24.598
You broke into the office. You're the one who picked the yacht as the strike point.

01:43:33.113 --> 01:43:36.105
You picked the boat. You picked the day.

01:43:36.183 --> 01:43:38.743
You tracked the crew, the food, the fuel.

01:43:38.819 --> 01:43:41.253
You told us where. You told us when.

01:43:41.322 --> 01:43:45.088
You hid out on that boat five days.

01:43:45.159 --> 01:43:49.596
You were in, Jason. You were in. It was over.

01:44:49.223 --> 01:44:52.351
No, you do remember.

01:44:54.895 --> 01:44:56.886
Don't you?

01:45:02.536 --> 01:45:04.527
I don't wanna do this anymore.

01:45:04.605 --> 01:45:08.063
I don't think that's a decision you can make.

01:45:12.479 --> 01:45:15.971
Jason Bourne is dead. Do you hear me?

01:45:16.050 --> 01:45:18.018
He drowned two weeks ago.

01:45:18.085 --> 01:45:20.417
You're gonna go tell 'em that Jason Bourne
is dead.

01:45:20.487 --> 01:45:22.546
Do you understand? Where are you gonna go?

01:45:22.623 --> 01:45:25.820
I swear to God, if I even feel somebody
behind me...

01:45:25.893 --> 01:45:30.592
there is no measure to how fast and how hard
I will bring this fight to your doorstep.

01:45:30.664 --> 01:45:32.894
I'm on my own side now.

01:49:07.481 --> 01:49:09.415
It's done.

01:49:09.483 --> 01:49:12.577
Shut it down.

01:49:49.089 --> 01:49:52.081
The Treadstone Project has already been
terminated.

01:49:52.159 --> 01:49:55.322
It was designed primarily as a sort of
advanced game program.

01:49:55.395 --> 01:49:57.955
We'd hoped it might build into a good training platform...

01:49:58.031 --> 01:50:01.330
but, quite honestly, for a strictly
theoretical exercise...

01:50:01.401 --> 01:50:04.427
the cost-benefit ratio was just too high.

01:50:04.504 --> 01:50:06.495
It's all but decommissioned at this point.

01:50:06.573 --> 01:50:08.871
All right. What's next? Okay.

01:50:08.942 --> 01:50:13.038
This is...Black Briar.

01:50:13.113 --> 01:50:16.082
Black Briar is a joint D.O.D. communications
program...

01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:18.174
that we really feel has good traction.

01:50:18.251 --> 01:50:20.742
It's got legs. It'll run and run.

01:50:20.821 --> 01:50:24.416
It combines elements of...

01:51:08.568 --> 01:51:11.401
This your store? - Yeah.

01:51:12.406 --> 01:51:15.000
It's nice.

01:51:15.075 --> 01:51:17.202
It's a little hard to find, but...

01:51:20.947 --> 01:51:23.848
Think I could rent a scooter?

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:28.454
You have I.D.?

01:51:30.123 --> 01:51:32.114
Not really.
