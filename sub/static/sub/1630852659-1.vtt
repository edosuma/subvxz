This program is rated G

00:04.233 --> 00:07.300
and is suitable for
general audiences.

00:13.467 --> 00:14.567
Good morning.

00:14.700 --> 00:17.233
This is your daily
affirmation guide...

00:18.767 --> 00:22.300
...Today is a new day

00:22.433 --> 00:25.100
and we're going
to wake up strong.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.667
Any worries that I may have
shall pass,

00:27.800 --> 00:30.300
as they did yesterday,
the day before,

00:30.433 --> 00:31.667
and every day.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.300
If I begin to lose focus,

00:33.433 --> 00:35.533
I'll acknowledge
what's worrying me.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.700
If I can resolve it, I will,

00:37.834 --> 00:40.133
and if I can't, I'll let it go,

00:40.266 --> 00:42.500
roll up my anxieties
into a tiny ball,

00:42.633 --> 00:45.133
and just throw them away.

00:45.266 --> 00:47.667
And as we do every morning,

00:47.800 --> 00:50.066
let's have a moment of silence,

00:50.200 --> 00:52.967
where we acknowledge
our inner journey.

00:54.233 --> 00:55.934
...And a deep breath in,

00:56.066 --> 00:58.100
and quiet...

01:06.533 --> 01:07.500
Oh...

01:10.367 --> 01:11.400
Hi!

01:11.533 --> 01:12.734
Hey!

01:12.867 --> 01:14.367
Just moved in.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.533
Um... do you need any help?

01:16.667 --> 01:17.967
Uh... no.

01:18.100 --> 01:18.834
I think I'm all right.

01:21.667 --> 01:22.500
Are you, though?

01:22.633 --> 01:24.333
What was that?

01:24.467 --> 01:26.533
Hmm? Uh, I said, "good luck."

01:26.667 --> 01:28.100
Thanks.

01:31.533 --> 01:33.400
Okay.

01:51.133 --> 01:52.133
Now let's take a moment

01:52.266 --> 01:54.700
to concentrate
on our breathing...

01:54.834 --> 01:59.700
with silence, deep breaths.

02:01.533 --> 02:02.633
Taylor?

02:02.767 --> 02:03.567
Yeah.

02:03.700 --> 02:04.800
Here you go.

02:04.934 --> 02:06.233
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:07.867 --> 02:10.400
Clear the mind
of any negative thoughts,

02:10.533 --> 02:12.467
and start the day fresh,

02:12.600 --> 02:13.533
and free of any fear,

02:13.667 --> 02:15.934
or worries, or anxieties.

02:16.066 --> 02:17.000
I am whole,

02:17.133 --> 02:19.900
and I can conquer today.

02:23.333 --> 02:26.834
We are going to take
our final deep breath in...

02:29.967 --> 02:31.567
and hold...

02:33.367 --> 02:34.467
...and release.

02:38.133 --> 02:38.967
Good morning, Kyle.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.400
Good morning, Taylor.

02:40.533 --> 02:43.133
So, what's the flavor
of the day, birthday girl?

02:43.266 --> 02:45.633
A little sage,
a little patchouli?

02:45.767 --> 02:46.500
Lavender.

02:46.633 --> 02:49.367
Ooh, that would
go great with...

02:49.500 --> 02:50.633
a little lemon coffee cake.

02:50.767 --> 02:51.834
Happy Birthday.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.066
Thank you.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.567
...and the samples
for the Pattersons,

02:55.700 --> 02:56.967
which I'm guessing
you will like better.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.133
Yes, these are first
on my to-do list.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.300
So, what's the plans
for the big day?

03:01.433 --> 03:02.834
Nothing big,
just gonna go see my dad.

03:02.967 --> 03:03.667
What?

03:03.800 --> 03:05.100
Seriously?

03:05.233 --> 03:06.967
No, no, no, you're coming out
with me and my friends tonight.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.033
We're gonna go grab some Thai,

03:08.166 --> 03:09.166
maybe a little karaoke.

03:09.300 --> 03:10.633
Ooh, I could use a duet partner.

03:10.767 --> 03:11.900
Thank you,

03:12.033 --> 03:13.533
but, um, the Pattersons
want their home reorganized

03:13.667 --> 03:14.700
by the end of the month,

03:14.834 --> 03:16.400
and that means all new built-ins
in the closets,

03:16.533 --> 03:17.667
and new modules in the den,

03:17.800 --> 03:20.133
and that's a disaster, so...

03:20.266 --> 03:21.700
Well, hey, if you're swamped,

03:21.834 --> 03:23.100
I could easily take over
the Tillerman job.

03:23.233 --> 03:24.567
I'm already on that one.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.000
Oh, well, how about I put
some samples together

03:26.133 --> 03:27.233
for the Schwartzs' walk-in?

03:27.367 --> 03:28.500
You know what,
I'm so in the zone there,

03:28.633 --> 03:30.000
so I think I'll just keep going.

03:30.133 --> 03:31.367
You know how I get
with new clients,

03:31.500 --> 03:33.100
I just like to, you know...

03:34.233 --> 03:36.600
Maybe I'm stepping
out of bounds here,

03:36.734 --> 03:38.300
but maybe you should think
about taking a holiday.

03:38.433 --> 03:40.533
You know, celebrate
the big 3-0 in style?

03:40.667 --> 03:42.367
I mean, I haven't seen you
take a day off

03:42.500 --> 03:43.667
since you hired me.

03:43.800 --> 03:44.633
Remember?

03:44.767 --> 03:45.900
For my excellent design skills,

03:46.033 --> 03:46.934
and, of course, charm,

03:47.066 --> 03:48.133
but that's not the point.

03:48.266 --> 03:49.200
The point is

03:49.333 --> 03:50.800
have you thought about
taking a day off?

03:50.934 --> 03:51.834
No.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.500
But thank you so much
for the invite--

03:55.633 --> 03:56.333
sorry I can't make it--

03:56.467 --> 03:57.500
and for the cake.

03:57.633 --> 04:00.367
Off to celebrate with my Dad.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.400
Brrr!

04:01.533 --> 04:02.567
All right, happy birthday.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.900
Thank you!

04:05.066 --> 04:06.233
Ooh, a new match.

04:19.967 --> 04:21.100
Dad?

04:24.834 --> 04:26.166
Dad!

04:32.834 --> 04:33.834
Dad...

04:35.533 --> 04:37.533
There she is.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.266
- Hi!
- Hi!

04:39.400 --> 04:40.467
Mm...

04:42.700 --> 04:44.834
So... what do you think?

04:44.967 --> 04:47.066
I tried to have it ready
for your birthday,

04:47.200 --> 04:48.333
but you cannot rush art.

04:48.467 --> 04:50.100
I know.

04:50.233 --> 04:51.934
I love it already.

04:52.066 --> 04:53.133
Good.

04:53.266 --> 04:55.066
Well, it's not
the only present you're getting.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.767
Oh, Dad, you don't
have to get me anything else.

04:56.900 --> 04:59.400
It's not from me.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.200
What?

05:08.100 --> 05:10.200
Open it.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.266
Okay...

05:15.400 --> 05:17.367
This looks like a...

05:17.500 --> 05:18.467
map,

05:18.600 --> 05:20.000
maybe of this property?

05:20.133 --> 05:21.667
Is it a landscaping plan?

05:21.800 --> 05:23.166
No, it couldn't be,
because there's arrows.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.266
Why would there be arrows
on a landscaping plan?

05:25.400 --> 05:27.100
Questions, questions,
so many questions.

05:27.233 --> 05:28.600
Just follow the map,

05:28.734 --> 05:30.200
and let the adventure begin.

05:32.133 --> 05:33.133
Come on.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.667
Out here...

05:38.800 --> 05:40.567
Yeah.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.400
Continue...

05:45.967 --> 05:46.934
This...

05:48.867 --> 05:51.166
Over to...

05:51.300 --> 05:52.734
the dragonfly?

05:52.867 --> 05:53.667
I don't get it.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.800
Look a little closer.

06:00.467 --> 06:03.033
Am I supposed to...

06:03.166 --> 06:04.533
Ooh.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.433
Okay.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.900
"What did you do
on your 30th birthday?"

06:11.033 --> 06:12.400
"Dug up my Dad's backyard."

06:12.533 --> 06:14.500
Here we go.

06:19.867 --> 06:21.467
Huh, what's that?

06:23.800 --> 06:27.500
Is this like a time capsule?

06:27.633 --> 06:29.567
It looks very much
like it is, yes.

06:32.300 --> 06:33.867
Let me, uh...

06:34.000 --> 06:34.867
Thanks.

06:38.000 --> 06:38.934
Got it.

06:42.467 --> 06:44.400
Is this from Mom?

06:44.533 --> 06:47.367
She wanted you to unearth it
on your 30th birthday.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.233
Oh, that's
my birth certificate.

07:08.734 --> 07:11.100
The first tooth I ever lost.

07:14.266 --> 07:15.600
Oh... my god.

07:15.734 --> 07:18.400
This was my first
oral presentation.

07:18.533 --> 07:19.734
Do you remember
how nervous I was?

07:19.867 --> 07:21.300
I had to get up
in front of the whole class.

07:21.433 --> 07:23.300
I do.

07:23.433 --> 07:25.533
Mom really coached me
through that.

07:30.734 --> 07:32.033
What's this?

07:32.166 --> 07:33.533
Read the note.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.900
"Dear, Taylor.

07:42.033 --> 07:44.300
I know I won't be with you
on this special day..."

07:47.600 --> 07:49.300
"...so I put together
this time capsule

07:49.433 --> 07:51.166
of items from your childhood,

07:51.300 --> 07:53.433
as well as
a series of challenges

07:53.567 --> 07:54.900
in these envelopes.

07:55.033 --> 07:56.467
Complete all six of them,

07:56.600 --> 07:59.200
and my birthday gift to you
should be revealed.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.734
Love, Mom."

08:00.867 --> 08:03.600
Should I open
challenge number one?

08:03.734 --> 08:05.367
I think so.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.467
Okay.

08:12.166 --> 08:14.500
"Get To Know Someone New".

08:14.633 --> 08:18.066
Ah, Mom's still being Mom.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.567
Well, she was the one

08:19.700 --> 08:22.233
who got you through
all of your anxieties.

08:22.367 --> 08:25.166
Yeah, but...

08:25.300 --> 08:27.867
I'm not really that little
anxious girl anymore, Dad.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.367
I mean, I run my own business.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.166
I live by myself.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.967
I can take care of myself.

08:33.100 --> 08:33.800
I--

08:33.934 --> 08:35.000
"I"...

08:35.133 --> 08:36.967
I hear a lot of "I's" there.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.100
Maybe your mom
wasn't so far off the mark

08:40.233 --> 08:41.433
when she wanted you to get out,

08:41.567 --> 08:43.667
and meet someone new?

08:43.800 --> 08:44.633
A friend.

08:45.967 --> 08:47.367
I have friends.

08:48.467 --> 08:49.433
I do have friends--

08:49.567 --> 08:51.900
I have... Kyle,
at the office.

08:52.033 --> 08:52.967
He's my friend.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.633
He invited me out tonight, so...

08:55.767 --> 08:56.600
Oh, and are you going to?

08:56.734 --> 08:57.700
I'm not gonna go,

08:57.834 --> 08:59.633
but that's only because
I have a lot of work.

08:59.767 --> 09:00.734
Nothing to do

09:00.867 --> 09:02.800
with getting outside
your safety zone,

09:02.934 --> 09:04.266
or your comfort bubble?

09:04.400 --> 09:07.700
I go out of my safety zone
all the time, Dad.

09:07.834 --> 09:09.767
I go to my clients' houses,

09:09.900 --> 09:11.800
and talk to people.

09:11.934 --> 09:13.133
This is not a big deal.

09:13.266 --> 09:15.633
Then why are you rubbing
your worry angel?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.066
I'm not worried.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.300
I'm not.

09:20.433 --> 09:22.200
You know what,
this isn't even a challenge.

09:22.333 --> 09:23.700
- No?
- No.

09:23.834 --> 09:24.934
Okay, well,
I'm glad you think so,

09:25.066 --> 09:27.033
because your mother,
if you read the fine print,

09:27.166 --> 09:29.700
has asked you to provide
photographic evidence

09:29.834 --> 09:32.300
of every challenge completed.

09:33.734 --> 09:35.567
Oh, that's just great.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.533
Now, come on.

09:36.667 --> 09:39.200
Let's go inside
and get some cake.

09:47.834 --> 09:48.767
Good morning.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.400
This is your daily
affirmation guide.

09:51.533 --> 09:53.600
As your morning begins,

09:53.734 --> 09:56.300
remember to tackle
today's horizons,

09:56.433 --> 09:58.000
our challenges,

09:58.133 --> 09:59.900
with ease and inner wisdom,

10:00.033 --> 10:04.567
knowing that you can do this.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.200
Large Americano with oat milk
for Taylor.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.734
That's me.

10:28.867 --> 10:30.166
- There you go.
- Thank you.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.467
You're welcome.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.300
What's your name?

10:37.433 --> 10:38.433
Excuse me?

10:38.567 --> 10:41.400
I just,
I come here every day, and...

10:41.533 --> 10:42.233
you know my name.

10:42.367 --> 10:43.066
What's yours?

10:43.200 --> 10:44.066
It's Jenny.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.100
Jenny.

10:45.233 --> 10:47.633
So nice
to get to know you, Jenny.

10:47.767 --> 10:48.967
Likewise.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.433
Yup.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.133
Dad? I did it.

11:01.266 --> 11:02.500
I met somebody new,

11:02.633 --> 11:03.567
I even got her name,

11:03.700 --> 11:05.667
and it's Jenny.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.867
Well, yeah, I'd assume
you would get their name.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.500
What does this Jenny do?

11:09.633 --> 11:11.033
Oh, she works
at my coffee shop.

11:11.166 --> 11:11.867
The coffee shop.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.934
Okay.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.934
Uh, Dad I'm gonna text you
the picture later, okay?

11:16.066 --> 11:17.467
I gotta run.
I love you.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.100
Love you, too.

11:22.533 --> 11:23.400
Hi.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.600
I'm Josh,
your new neighbor.

11:25.734 --> 11:26.834
The one who's life
was scattered everywhere

11:26.967 --> 11:28.333
the other day.

11:28.467 --> 11:29.300
Yes, of course.

11:29.433 --> 11:31.300
Um, I'm Taylor.

11:31.433 --> 11:32.467
It's nice to meet you,

11:32.600 --> 11:34.467
and I'm sorry about the mess
in the driveway.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.300
It's fine.
It wasn't a bother.

11:36.433 --> 11:37.533
Great, uh,

11:37.667 --> 11:38.767
except for
I'm going to bother you now

11:38.900 --> 11:40.400
because I can't seem to find
my can opener,

11:40.533 --> 11:41.533
which isn't surprising

11:41.667 --> 11:43.667
if you saw the bomb
that went off in my house.

11:43.800 --> 11:44.633
I have one.

11:44.767 --> 11:45.633
I can lend it to you.

11:45.767 --> 11:46.734
- Come on in.
- Great.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.133
Wow, nice place.

11:50.266 --> 11:51.600
It's very organized.

11:51.734 --> 11:53.767
Yeah,
I like to keep it that way.

11:53.900 --> 11:54.834
I, uh, it's kind of what I do,

11:54.967 --> 11:57.000
cleaning, organizing stuff.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.400
There you go.

11:58.533 --> 11:59.834
Oh, great.

11:59.967 --> 12:02.200
Now my daughter can be fed
something other than pizza,

12:02.333 --> 12:04.033
which has been our staple
for the last few days.

12:04.166 --> 12:06.734
I have take-out menus that I...

12:06.867 --> 12:07.700
threw out.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.333
This is gonna be great,

12:09.467 --> 12:10.500
and I promise to pop it
in your mailbox

12:10.633 --> 12:11.467
as soon as I'm done.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.834
No rush.

12:12.967 --> 12:15.500
I have all my meals
prepped for the week, so...

12:15.633 --> 12:16.834
Wow, you are organized.

12:16.967 --> 12:19.033
Unlike myself, who can't even
label a packing box,

12:19.166 --> 12:20.834
because unlike the can opener,

12:20.967 --> 12:22.533
I did find
the salt and pepper shakers

12:22.667 --> 12:24.033
in the box labeled "bedroom".

12:24.166 --> 12:26.934
Um, but I'm not gonna bore you
with my stories any longer,

12:27.066 --> 12:28.367
and this is great, so...

12:28.500 --> 12:29.667
thank you,

12:29.800 --> 12:32.333
and, uh, it was nice
to officially meet you.

12:32.467 --> 12:33.533
Yes.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.600
It was nice to meet you.

12:35.734 --> 12:37.700
Officially.

12:37.834 --> 12:38.967
Um, welcome
to the neighborhood.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.000
Thanks.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.934
I, uh...
I think I like it already.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.667
You know, I think this might
be my new favorite.

12:55.033 --> 12:56.033
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.400
I'm glad.

12:57.533 --> 13:00.266
So tell me more
about this Jenny barista--

13:00.400 --> 13:01.633
Oh, forget about Jenny.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.433
I want to tell you about Josh,

13:03.567 --> 13:04.734
my new neighbor.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.967
He came over the other day
to borrow a can opener,

13:08.100 --> 13:10.600
and I think I just
knocked that challenge

13:10.734 --> 13:12.233
right out of the park.

13:12.367 --> 13:13.967
So he came to you
for a can opener?

13:14.100 --> 13:15.066
Yeah, that's right.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.767
I see, and, um,
during this exchange,

13:17.900 --> 13:19.633
what did you learn
about Josh?

13:19.767 --> 13:22.200
That he has a daughter,

13:22.333 --> 13:24.433
and that
he's pretty disorganized.

13:24.567 --> 13:26.633
Okay.

13:27.900 --> 13:28.700
What?

13:30.100 --> 13:31.100
Can opener.

13:31.233 --> 13:32.867
Disorganized.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.333
I mean, I think your mom
wanted you

13:36.467 --> 13:38.300
to really get to know someone.

13:38.433 --> 13:39.266
Work at it a little bit,

13:39.400 --> 13:40.567
spend some time with them.

13:40.700 --> 13:43.367
Otherwise it's not really
a challenge, is it?

13:44.967 --> 13:46.633
Fine.

13:46.767 --> 13:48.367
I'll work on it.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.000
For Mom.

13:52.100 --> 14:02.133
Atta girl.

14:06.700 --> 14:07.700
Hmm.

14:11.900 --> 14:12.900
Hello.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.700
I thought I'd just drop by

14:14.834 --> 14:16.867
and say welcome
to the neighborhood.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.133
I already said that.

14:18.266 --> 14:19.266
Um...

14:19.400 --> 14:20.133
Hello.

14:20.266 --> 14:21.100
Thought I'd just whip this up.

14:21.233 --> 14:22.633
It's something other than pizza.

14:22.767 --> 14:24.133
That's too Betty Crocker.

14:24.266 --> 14:25.233
Um...

14:28.066 --> 14:29.066
Um...

14:31.400 --> 14:32.200
Hey.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.100
Hi.

14:33.233 --> 14:33.967
Uh, it's, uh...

14:34.100 --> 14:35.433
It's food.

14:35.567 --> 14:36.433
Oh.

14:36.567 --> 14:37.734
Thank you.

14:37.867 --> 14:39.233
This is very kind of you.

14:39.367 --> 14:40.333
Oh, and I'm sorry,

14:40.467 --> 14:42.233
I meant to bring
your can opener over,

14:42.367 --> 14:43.767
but I got a little distracted

14:43.900 --> 14:46.133
trying to sort my life out
in all these boxes.

14:46.266 --> 14:48.000
That's okay,
'cause I got you this.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.000
That is
very neighborly of you.

14:51.934 --> 14:52.800
Did you have a minute?

14:52.934 --> 14:54.233
I just put the kettle on.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.400
Uh, yeah, sure,
that'd be lovely.

14:57.533 --> 14:59.233
- Great. Come on in.
- Okay.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.834
Uh, so, uh, chamomile,
peppermint tea,

15:03.967 --> 15:05.033
or maybe just black tea?

15:05.166 --> 15:06.033
Peppermint would be lovely.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.133
Great.

15:08.767 --> 15:10.433
Oh, wow.

15:10.567 --> 15:12.800
Yeah, I know,
it's a bit of a disaster,

15:12.934 --> 15:14.467
but with Chloe's school,

15:14.600 --> 15:16.667
and my teaching,
and then coaching,

15:16.800 --> 15:18.166
and constant
furniture deliveries,

15:18.300 --> 15:20.133
I haven't really had time
to sort through it.

15:20.266 --> 15:21.800
You know, if you need help,

15:21.934 --> 15:24.500
I know of a service who will
unpack all of this for you.

15:24.633 --> 15:25.800
Really?

15:25.934 --> 15:28.033
Would they be able to help me
organize it as well?

15:28.166 --> 15:31.166
No, but I know of another
service that can do that.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.367
Me.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.100
- You?
- Yeah, it's my company.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.300
"Space to Live."

15:35.433 --> 15:36.834
I help people
organize their homes

15:36.967 --> 15:38.033
so they can live in them
stress and worry free.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.433
Huh.

15:39.567 --> 15:42.000
Well, maybe I'll have to
employ your services one day.

15:50.567 --> 15:51.533
Hi.

15:52.934 --> 15:54.100
I'm Taylor.

15:54.233 --> 15:55.700
I'm Chloe.

15:57.266 --> 15:59.967
This is a beautiful house.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.433
Look at those the wood floors

16:01.567 --> 16:03.233
and the bay window!

16:03.367 --> 16:05.433
You know, with all that
natural light coming through,

16:05.567 --> 16:07.266
a chair might be nice there.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.734
I never thought
about the light,

16:08.867 --> 16:10.633
but, uh, well,
you'd be the expert.

16:14.467 --> 16:15.700
What do you think
about the piano?

16:15.834 --> 16:17.934
Piano?

16:18.066 --> 16:22.000
Well, I know that
we do not have a piano, so...

16:22.133 --> 16:26.066
Oh, I see you've found
our project.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.734
I used to have
a dollhouse, too.

16:27.867 --> 16:28.900
My dad made it for me.

16:29.033 --> 16:30.734
He's so good at creating things.

16:30.867 --> 16:34.000
This is my daughter, Chloe.

16:34.133 --> 16:36.533
Chloe, this is
our new neighbor, Taylor,

16:36.667 --> 16:38.433
and she was kind enough
to bring us a casserole.

16:38.567 --> 16:40.100
I hope it's not tuna.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.667
Chloe...

16:41.800 --> 16:42.734
No, that's fine.

16:42.867 --> 16:45.000
It's not.
It's chicken.

16:45.133 --> 16:47.033
But if you don't like that,
that's fine, too.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.133
There were so many things
I didn't like

16:48.266 --> 16:49.367
when I was your age.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.600
Like... tomatoes.

16:51.734 --> 16:53.066
I like tomato sauce.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.367
Ooh, good,
'cause it's in the casserole.

16:56.667 --> 16:57.900
Are you staying
to have it with us?

16:58.033 --> 16:59.900
No. No, no,
I wasn't planning on that.

17:00.100 --> 17:00.967
Why not?

17:01.100 --> 17:02.400
Uh, clearly,

17:02.533 --> 17:04.266
we would enjoy the company.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.800
Unless you have your family,
or someone to...

17:07.934 --> 17:09.100
No, no, I...
It's just me over there,

17:09.233 --> 17:11.066
but it's, um...

17:11.200 --> 17:12.133
it's Wednesday,

17:12.266 --> 17:15.033
which means it's laundry day,
so...

17:18.300 --> 17:20.066
I mean, okay,
I guess I could stay.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.300
Yeah!

17:21.433 --> 17:23.367
I'll set you up a spot.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.934
Oh, uh, the cutlery's
in the box labeled "kitchen".

17:28.433 --> 17:29.633
- Uh, casserole, 350?
- Yeah.

17:29.767 --> 17:31.233
Dad!

17:31.367 --> 17:33.333
Are you sure
this is a kitchen box?

17:33.467 --> 17:36.667
Uh... maybe
we'll find the utensils

17:36.800 --> 17:39.667
in the Christmas box.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.934
What time
did the jack-o-lantern

17:42.066 --> 17:44.333
go to the dentist?

17:44.467 --> 17:45.734
Tooth-hurty?

17:45.867 --> 17:47.433
- Hey, you know this one!
- Oh, what?

17:50.967 --> 17:53.033
Well, that was delicious.

17:53.166 --> 17:54.100
- Great.
- Yeah.

17:54.233 --> 17:55.633
I have to go
finish my homework,

17:55.767 --> 17:57.433
but will we see you again?

17:57.567 --> 17:58.367
Yeah.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.233
Yeah, of course.
I mean... yeah,

18:00.367 --> 18:02.200
and if you want,

18:02.333 --> 18:03.867
I could get you some paper
and paint samples

18:04.000 --> 18:05.166
from one of my jobs
for your dollhouse.

18:05.300 --> 18:06.033
Yes, please.

18:06.166 --> 18:06.900
Cool.

18:07.033 --> 18:08.000
It was so nice to meet you.

18:08.133 --> 18:09.300
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Yeah.

18:10.834 --> 18:12.467
- See you later then.
- Bye.

18:14.867 --> 18:15.567
She is so lovely.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.467
She's pretty special.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.367
Although...

18:18.500 --> 18:20.300
since her mom died a year ago,

18:20.433 --> 18:22.133
she's been a bit withdrawn,

18:22.266 --> 18:23.500
and a bit anxious.

18:23.633 --> 18:26.467
You know, I thought that
being a phys-ed teacher

18:26.600 --> 18:27.467
at the college

18:27.600 --> 18:29.000
would have helped,

18:29.133 --> 18:30.533
you know, dealing with athletes
and all their stress,

18:30.667 --> 18:33.300
but... it's been
a bit of a challenge.

18:33.433 --> 18:37.100
My mom had
similar challenges with me.

18:37.233 --> 18:38.500
I get it.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.800
Well, now that you know
all about us,

18:42.934 --> 18:43.867
what about you?

18:44.000 --> 18:44.900
You know,

18:45.033 --> 18:46.567
aside from being
and expert organizer.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.834
Well, there really
isn't much else to tell you.

18:49.967 --> 18:53.233
Like I said,
it's just me over there, so...

18:53.367 --> 18:54.834
Well, we're glad
you're over there.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.367
I'm glad you feel that way,

18:56.500 --> 18:57.667
and likewise,

18:57.800 --> 18:59.667
it's been really nice
to get to know you and Chloe.

19:00.934 --> 19:02.033
Uh, speaking of which,

19:02.166 --> 19:03.533
it is a school night,

19:03.667 --> 19:05.233
and I probably should
help her get to bed.

19:05.367 --> 19:06.400
Totally,

19:06.533 --> 19:08.400
and I'm normally
prepping for work by now, so...

19:08.533 --> 19:09.967
Scheduled and organized.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.967
I really should hire you.

19:12.100 --> 19:12.900
Well, you know
where to find me.

19:13.033 --> 19:14.233
Right across the street?

19:14.367 --> 19:15.700
Yes.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.400
Yeah. Okay, yeah,
let me ask her.

19:20.533 --> 19:21.567
The college wants to know

19:21.700 --> 19:23.133
what date you plan on going in

19:23.266 --> 19:24.200
to organize the library.

19:24.333 --> 19:25.133
This Saturday at 10:00 a.m.

19:25.266 --> 19:26.934
Saturday at 10:00.

19:27.066 --> 19:27.967
Great.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.633
Thank you.

19:30.533 --> 19:31.467
Oh, no, no,
actually, leave those.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.767
I'm going to give them
to my neighbor,

19:32.900 --> 19:34.600
or his daughter.

19:34.734 --> 19:35.800
We met the other day,

19:35.934 --> 19:38.300
had dinner together,
got to know one another.

19:38.433 --> 19:39.300
Sounds very...

19:39.433 --> 19:40.533
Pleasantville.

19:40.667 --> 19:41.467
Yeah.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.567
He's a single dad,

19:42.700 --> 19:43.667
a widower.

19:45.066 --> 19:46.600
Kinda disorganized.

19:46.734 --> 19:48.367
Actually, no,
he's a total mess.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
So is he a possible
new client, or...

19:51.734 --> 19:52.600
No, I don't...

19:52.734 --> 19:55.100
I mean, maybe, I don't know.

19:55.233 --> 19:56.300
I guess he could--
I don't know.

19:56.433 --> 19:57.266
He's a new neighbor.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.700
A new friend.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.433
Mm-hmm...

20:00.567 --> 20:02.066
and is this new friend dating?

20:02.200 --> 20:03.600
I don't know that.

20:03.734 --> 20:04.967
How am I supposed to know that?

20:05.100 --> 20:06.967
Well, let's creep
his social media.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.633
Oh, hold on.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.867
Yeah, got a new match.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.133
Ooh...

20:12.266 --> 20:13.967
Hello, Christie.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.233
I'm just going to send you
a wave and a smiley emoji.

20:17.367 --> 20:19.300
Oh, what's his name?

20:19.433 --> 20:20.166
Uh, Josh--

20:20.300 --> 20:21.133
Oh! Oh...

20:21.266 --> 20:22.100
Is that her already?

20:22.233 --> 20:23.300
No, no, no, this is Jade.

20:23.433 --> 20:25.467
I'm gonna respond back
to Veronica quickly...

20:25.600 --> 20:26.533
Ooh...

20:26.667 --> 20:28.300
Are you dating
all of these women?

20:28.433 --> 20:29.700
No, no, not dating.

20:29.834 --> 20:31.934
Just, you know, messaging.

20:32.066 --> 20:34.300
So you've never met them?

20:34.433 --> 20:37.433
Whoa, slow down, Taylor,
pump your brakes.

20:37.567 --> 20:38.533
I gotta get to know them first,
feel them out.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.834
You know, decode the emojis

20:40.967 --> 20:42.734
before I commit
to, like, a whole date.

20:44.834 --> 20:46.433
How do you
get to know them, though,

20:46.567 --> 20:47.533
if you never meet them?

20:47.667 --> 20:49.100
I'm on all the dating apps.

20:49.233 --> 20:50.967
I know exactly
how this works, okay?

20:51.100 --> 20:53.333
She's so funny.

21:32.266 --> 21:35.033
"Do something
that you're afraid of."

21:35.166 --> 21:36.133
Hah.

21:36.266 --> 21:37.967
Thanks, Mom.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.300
Okay, my friend,

21:55.433 --> 21:58.667
you will be my next challenge.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.433
Chloe!

22:00.567 --> 22:03.066
Have you seen
a little black box?

22:03.200 --> 22:05.333
Like a jewelry box?

22:09.967 --> 22:12.333
Hey, are you okay?

22:12.467 --> 22:14.000
What? Yeah.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.333
Yeah, I'm great.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.066
I'm so good.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.367
Okay, uh...

22:18.500 --> 22:21.100
just seems like
you've forgotten your shoes.

22:25.066 --> 22:26.734
Yeah.

22:27.734 --> 22:28.767
Do you need help?

22:28.900 --> 22:30.400
Maybe.

22:30.533 --> 22:31.400
It's a big spider,

22:31.533 --> 22:32.633
like, it's, uh...

22:32.767 --> 22:35.667
I think it ate all my food
in all the house.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.767
- It's...
- Okay.

22:36.900 --> 22:38.066
...and it, uh, well...

22:38.200 --> 22:39.233
it's very unpredictable.

22:39.367 --> 22:40.233
You know, spiders are like

22:40.367 --> 22:42.600
having your own form
of pest control.

22:42.734 --> 22:45.433
They eat all sorts of bugs
that could become pests.

22:45.567 --> 22:49.133
Well, pretty sure that guy
ate all the bugs on the block.

22:50.567 --> 22:51.834
Um, thank you so much
for saving the day,

22:51.967 --> 22:53.600
and I'm really sorry

22:53.734 --> 22:55.200
that I had to bother you
with that.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.367
Oh, you owe me a few bothers.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.233
Besides,
it's not really a big deal.

22:59.367 --> 23:00.433
For me.

23:00.567 --> 23:01.667
I get it that
not everyone's into spiders.

23:01.800 --> 23:02.900
Nope.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.400
You know, in fact Chloe
once saw one in her room,

23:04.533 --> 23:05.467
and she ended up sleeping
in a tent in the living room

23:05.600 --> 23:06.300
for a week.

23:06.433 --> 23:07.700
That's my kind of girl.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.500
- I have her samples.
- Oh.

23:10.633 --> 23:11.600
How is she?

23:11.734 --> 23:12.834
Ah, not bad,

23:12.967 --> 23:14.834
until she was assigned
an oral presentation,

23:14.967 --> 23:16.266
and now the wheels
have come off a little bit.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.500
I get it.

23:17.633 --> 23:19.400
I did not like
oral presentations in school.

23:19.533 --> 23:20.633
In fact,

23:20.767 --> 23:22.734
my first oral presentation
was such a big deal,

23:22.867 --> 23:24.600
that my mom put it
in a time capsule for me.

23:24.734 --> 23:26.333
Wow, a time capsule.

23:26.467 --> 23:28.266
That's really cool.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.400
Yeah.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.600
My mom was pretty cool.

23:31.867 --> 23:34.333
If you want,
I could maybe help her

23:34.467 --> 23:36.233
with her anxiety
about the presentation?

23:36.367 --> 23:37.934
Seeing as I have--

23:38.066 --> 23:39.300
um, had-- used to have

23:39.433 --> 23:40.934
the same issues.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.400
Well, she won't talk to me
or anyone about it,

23:44.533 --> 23:45.967
so, I mean,
if you wouldn't mind...

23:46.100 --> 23:48.300
No, I really wouldn't mind.

23:48.433 --> 23:51.367
Um, I have a job at the college
on Saturday,

23:51.500 --> 23:52.467
but after that I'm free.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.166
Oh, I'm actually
at the college on Saturday

23:54.300 --> 23:55.367
for training camps,

23:55.500 --> 23:56.667
and usually I drag Chloe
along with me, so...

23:56.800 --> 23:58.300
I could keep her busy.

23:58.433 --> 23:59.834
That would be...
that would be great.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.133
Uh...

24:02.266 --> 24:03.500
I should go, but...

24:03.633 --> 24:05.200
I'll see you Saturday?

24:05.333 --> 24:06.800
Yeah. Great.

24:06.934 --> 24:07.900
Thanks again.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.533
How was your day?

24:20.667 --> 24:21.400
Good.

24:21.533 --> 24:22.367
Yeah, good.

24:40.066 --> 24:41.133
Hey, Coach!

24:43.934 --> 24:45.033
Nice throw.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.433
Yeah.

24:51.633 --> 24:52.734
Hi!

24:52.867 --> 24:55.000
Taylor,
what are you doing here?

24:55.133 --> 24:56.600
I am here

24:56.734 --> 24:58.433
because I thought
I give you little bit of help

24:58.567 --> 25:00.467
on your presentation for school
if you want.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.867
Sure.

25:02.000 --> 25:02.967
Have you picked a topic yet?

25:03.100 --> 25:04.700
No.

25:04.834 --> 25:05.934
Well, my mom always told me

25:06.066 --> 25:07.734
that if you're gonna give
a presentation on something,

25:07.867 --> 25:10.867
it's best to pick a topic
that you really love.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.934
So, um, like...

25:13.066 --> 25:14.533
what's your favorite animal?

25:14.667 --> 25:15.900
I love elephants.

25:16.033 --> 25:17.100
Really? Why?

25:17.233 --> 25:18.266
Well, they're really gentle,

25:18.400 --> 25:20.100
even though they're
the largest land animal,

25:20.233 --> 25:21.400
and they're so big

25:21.533 --> 25:23.367
they have to eat
up to 16 hours a day.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.266
They do?

25:24.400 --> 25:26.533
Wouldn't that be something.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.700
And they can live
up to 70 years.

25:28.834 --> 25:30.433
Can they swim?

25:30.567 --> 25:32.300
Yeah, and they use
their trunks like snorkels.

25:32.433 --> 25:33.266
Cute.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.467
Can they fly like Dumbo?

25:35.600 --> 25:36.367
No.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.800
They can't even jump,

25:37.934 --> 25:39.800
but they have
really good memories.

25:39.934 --> 25:42.700
You know, you just told me
a lot about elephants.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.066
In fact,

25:44.200 --> 25:46.567
you kind just gave me
a presentation.

25:47.767 --> 25:49.433
So why don't we try something.

25:49.567 --> 25:50.533
Um, Josh?

25:53.533 --> 25:54.533
Yeah?

25:54.667 --> 25:56.367
Okay, so your dad and I
are gonna pretend

25:56.500 --> 25:57.200
to be kids in your class.

25:57.333 --> 25:58.800
So who would I be?

25:58.934 --> 25:59.767
Definitely Miya.

25:59.900 --> 26:00.834
She's my best friend.

26:00.967 --> 26:01.867
Yes!

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
And Dad, you can be Liam.

26:03.133 --> 26:04.533
- He's always messy.
- Oh, perfect.

26:04.667 --> 26:06.200
Hey.

26:06.333 --> 26:09.033
Okay, so you're gonna practice
giving us--

26:09.166 --> 26:11.767
I mean, me, Miya,
and Liam,

26:11.900 --> 26:12.600
a presentation on elephants.

26:12.734 --> 26:13.533
Cool?

26:13.667 --> 26:15.867
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:19.433 --> 26:20.967
Hello, Liam.

26:21.100 --> 26:22.533
Hello... you-a.

26:24.100 --> 26:25.633
What?

26:28.967 --> 26:31.500
It's what kids do
in this class, right?

26:32.633 --> 26:33.333
Okay, fine.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.667
Go ahead.

26:37.333 --> 26:41.967
Elephants are the biggest living
land animal on Earth...

26:44.967 --> 26:46.333
So, what are we doing here?

26:46.467 --> 26:48.533
We are getting
some lavender oil.

26:48.667 --> 26:50.133
It'll help Chloe relax

26:50.266 --> 26:51.767
whenever she's feeling
a bit anxious.

26:51.900 --> 26:54.133
I think it's right here.

26:54.266 --> 26:56.033
Oh, I see
you've been here before.

26:56.166 --> 26:57.667
Yeah, this was
my first contract.

26:57.800 --> 26:58.967
I organized the space

26:59.100 --> 27:03.033
to make it feel more calm
and serene.

27:03.166 --> 27:04.066
Hmm, I should
take a cue from that

27:04.200 --> 27:05.600
and become more calm
and organized,

27:05.734 --> 27:06.767
for Chloe.

27:06.900 --> 27:07.834
It would help,

27:07.967 --> 27:09.200
but I get it.

27:09.333 --> 27:10.934
My dad is a little like you, so.

27:11.066 --> 27:12.100
Scattered?

27:12.233 --> 27:13.633
He's an artist.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.433
The RJ gallery, that's his.

27:16.567 --> 27:18.467
Ah.

27:18.600 --> 27:22.367
My mom was the one
who kept the calm and order.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.400
Well, you definitely have
your mother's touch.

27:24.533 --> 27:26.166
I mean, look what you did today
with Chloe.

27:26.300 --> 27:27.767
I wish I could do that,

27:27.900 --> 27:30.767
but I've kind of felt
out of my league

27:30.900 --> 27:32.333
ever since Claire passed,

27:32.467 --> 27:34.367
and, well...

27:34.500 --> 27:36.233
that scares me.

27:36.367 --> 27:38.100
You know what,
almost everything scares me.

27:38.233 --> 27:41.233
You know that time capsule
that my mom gave me,

27:41.367 --> 27:42.567
it was filled with challenges,

27:42.700 --> 27:44.233
and challenge number two

27:44.367 --> 27:46.367
was that I just had to deal
with that tiny spider,

27:46.500 --> 27:48.100
and you saw how I did with that,

27:48.233 --> 27:50.066
so I think you're doing
pretty great.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.000
Thanks.

27:51.133 --> 27:52.133
Yeah.

27:52.266 --> 27:55.500
And for times when
you're not feeling so great...

27:55.633 --> 27:56.500
smell.

27:57.667 --> 27:59.700
Mm, not overly offensive.

27:59.834 --> 28:00.667
Right?

28:03.166 --> 28:05.433
You know, I think I can
probably help you

28:05.567 --> 28:06.567
with that challenge.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.333
I'm the kind of guy
who just dives right in

28:08.467 --> 28:09.333
and thinks later.

28:09.467 --> 28:11.066
Oh, you don't have to do that.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.934
Oh, come on, I owe you one,

28:13.066 --> 28:14.567
you know, for what you did
with Chloe.

28:14.700 --> 28:17.667
So, what scares you
other than spiders?

28:18.700 --> 28:19.600
Uh...

28:19.734 --> 28:21.934
how about anything unfamiliar?

28:22.066 --> 28:23.934
Hectic places,

28:24.066 --> 28:26.600
social events,

28:26.734 --> 28:29.000
um, amusement parks,
amusement park rides,

28:29.133 --> 28:29.967
Black Friday.

28:30.100 --> 28:30.934
You could not pay me
enough money

28:31.066 --> 28:31.967
to go on a cruise ship.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.166
Do you want me to keep going?

28:33.300 --> 28:34.834
No, no, no.

28:34.967 --> 28:36.000
Um...

28:36.133 --> 28:38.166
How about we throw out
your day-timer?

28:40.734 --> 28:41.567
What?

28:41.700 --> 28:44.633
Okay, uh, that's too strong.

28:44.767 --> 28:45.800
Yeah.

28:47.066 --> 28:48.266
Oh, uh, rides.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.066
Fair's closed.

28:50.200 --> 28:53.100
Oh, uh, what about heights,
you scared of those?

28:53.233 --> 28:54.233
Definitely.

28:54.367 --> 28:56.900
Most definitely
afraid of heights, yeah.

28:57.033 --> 28:58.100
Then I know the exact place

28:58.233 --> 28:59.200
we can just knock that challenge
right out of the park.

28:59.333 --> 29:00.300
You, me...

29:00.433 --> 29:02.000
You in?

29:02.133 --> 29:03.767
Yes.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.300
Great.

29:05.433 --> 29:06.533
Yup.

29:08.266 --> 29:09.200
I was just going to get one
for Chloe,

29:09.333 --> 29:11.300
but I think I need one
for myself, too.

29:11.433 --> 29:12.333
Okay.

29:12.467 --> 29:14.367
Hi!

29:14.500 --> 29:16.533
Okay, so,
what are you gonna do?

29:16.667 --> 29:18.500
Pick a topic I love,

29:18.633 --> 29:21.133
then practice, be prepared,
and know the room.

29:21.266 --> 29:22.166
That's it.

29:22.300 --> 29:23.166
You've got this.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.266
Yeah!

29:31.700 --> 29:32.967
Did you just...?

29:33.100 --> 29:33.834
I did.

29:33.967 --> 29:35.500
I'm so sorry.

29:35.633 --> 29:36.533
I should have asked first.

29:36.667 --> 29:38.700
I, um...

29:38.834 --> 29:40.700
It's for this challenge
that my mom has me doing,

29:40.834 --> 29:43.500
and she wants me to take
photo proof of everything,

29:43.633 --> 29:44.533
so...

29:44.667 --> 29:46.166
So you're saying
I'm a challenge?

29:46.300 --> 29:48.166
I...

29:48.300 --> 29:49.200
Kind of.

29:49.333 --> 29:52.900
Um, I had to meet
somebody new, and, um...

29:53.033 --> 29:54.033
here you are.

29:54.166 --> 29:56.700
Well, at least get
my good side, hmm?

29:56.834 --> 29:58.834
Thank you.

29:59.967 --> 30:01.000
- Okay, one more.
- Hello?

30:01.133 --> 30:03.734
Sara!

30:03.867 --> 30:07.333
Hi, sweetheart!

30:07.467 --> 30:08.834
Oh, wow, what's this?

30:08.967 --> 30:10.567
It's a gift Taylor got me,

30:10.700 --> 30:11.967
and I'm working on
my oral presentation.

30:12.100 --> 30:14.834
Sara, this is Taylor,
our new neighbor.

30:14.967 --> 30:16.333
- Pleasure to meet you.
- And you.

30:16.467 --> 30:18.700
Taylor was kind enough
to bring us over dinner

30:18.834 --> 30:19.700
a couple of nights ago.

30:19.834 --> 30:21.100
Oh, well, thank you,

30:21.233 --> 30:22.867
because I've been out of town,

30:23.000 --> 30:24.734
and I'm well aware
this one can't cook.

30:24.867 --> 30:26.367
Hey, I can cook, right?

30:26.500 --> 30:28.200
As long as it comes from a can,

30:28.333 --> 30:29.333
needs re-heating,

30:29.467 --> 30:30.734
and I have a can opener,
of course.

30:30.867 --> 30:34.066
Right... well, I was
just heading out, so...

30:34.200 --> 30:35.533
really nice to meet you.

30:35.667 --> 30:36.533
- You too.
- Yeah.

30:36.667 --> 30:37.867
- I'll see you later?
- Bye.

30:38.000 --> 30:38.900
Okay.

30:40.667 --> 30:42.900
So... next weekend?

30:43.033 --> 30:44.000
We conquer?

30:44.133 --> 30:46.333
- Absolutely.
- How's the project coming?

30:46.467 --> 30:47.734
- Pretty good.
- Bye!

31:12.300 --> 31:13.834
Hey.

31:14.900 --> 31:15.900
Hey.

31:16.033 --> 31:18.000
Sounds like you and Chloe
are having fun up there.

31:18.133 --> 31:19.467
Yeah, always,

31:19.600 --> 31:21.667
but I don't just come here
to spend time with Chloe.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.867
Yeah, I... I know.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.600
So your new neighbor
seems nice,

31:27.734 --> 31:29.633
bringing all that stuff
for Chloe's doll house,

31:29.767 --> 31:31.433
and helping her
with her project.

31:31.567 --> 31:32.734
Yeah.

31:34.033 --> 31:34.934
Is she married?

31:35.066 --> 31:36.867
No.

31:38.900 --> 31:41.033
By the way,
I love the new house.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.333
You know it means a lot to me

31:45.467 --> 31:47.500
how much you've been here
for Chloe.

31:47.633 --> 31:49.767
Well, I promised
to take care of both of you,

31:49.900 --> 31:53.233
and really, I'm on my own,

31:53.367 --> 31:55.233
so it's good for me, too.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.734
What was that thing

31:58.867 --> 32:00.200
you wanted to talk to me about?

32:00.333 --> 32:02.133
You said
you had something for me,

32:02.266 --> 32:03.066
a surprise?

32:03.200 --> 32:05.133
Oh, uh...

32:05.266 --> 32:06.166
yeah.

32:06.300 --> 32:09.367
Um... but I misplaced it
during the move,

32:09.500 --> 32:13.333
so, unfortunately,
you're just gonna have to wait.

32:13.467 --> 32:14.567
I guess.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.467
I'd better get back upstairs.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.133
I promised Chloe
a Crazy Eights rematch.

32:19.266 --> 32:20.700
Do you want to join us?

32:20.834 --> 32:22.367
Yeah, I'll, uh...
I'll be up in a minute.

32:22.500 --> 32:23.467
All right.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.433
So this is
your new friend, huh?

32:40.567 --> 32:41.734
Yeah,

32:41.867 --> 32:43.500
and we're gonna do the next
challenge together, too.

32:43.633 --> 32:45.066
Oh, you told him
about the time capsule?

32:45.200 --> 32:46.133
I did.

32:46.266 --> 32:47.166
I mean, he was sharing

32:47.300 --> 32:48.834
so I thought
I should share something.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.867
That's what you want, right,
me to get to know him?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.600
Sure.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.133
Sure. Okay...

32:55.266 --> 32:56.133
I'm gonna go.

32:56.266 --> 32:57.567
Um, I'll see you later.

32:57.700 --> 32:58.533
Wish me luck.

32:58.667 --> 33:00.233
How about have fun?

33:00.367 --> 33:01.633
Well, we'll see.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.033
See ya.

33:04.166 --> 33:06.166
Bye.

33:14.667 --> 33:15.967
Well, here we are.

33:17.834 --> 33:19.266
96 elephants.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.767
What?

33:20.900 --> 33:21.834
Yeah.

33:21.967 --> 33:22.900
That's how much
this bridge can hold.

33:23.033 --> 33:25.166
96 elephants.

33:28.567 --> 33:29.700
96 elephants, huh?

33:29.834 --> 33:31.033
I think Chloe
must really love it.

33:31.166 --> 33:32.133
Bye-bye.

33:32.266 --> 33:34.600
No, no, wait,
whoa, whoa, whoa...

33:34.734 --> 33:35.533
Nope.

33:35.667 --> 33:36.433
Come on,

33:36.567 --> 33:38.867
look at this.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.333
It's pretty incredible, right?

33:42.533 --> 33:43.467
Taylor?

33:43.600 --> 33:45.100
I'm sorry, my brain
is short-circuiting

33:45.233 --> 33:46.767
from all the alarm bells
going off.

33:46.900 --> 33:47.767
No, no, no,

33:47.900 --> 33:49.200
no alarm bells, okay?

33:49.333 --> 33:50.266
Uh, look,

33:50.400 --> 33:53.333
this bridge was built
in the 1800s,

33:53.467 --> 33:55.700
and it's probably had
hundreds of thousands,

33:55.834 --> 33:56.600
if not millions of people,

33:56.734 --> 33:57.633
cross it before you.

33:57.767 --> 33:59.367
That is a lot of wear and tear.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.000
Have we got any clue

34:01.133 --> 34:03.166
when it was last,
you know, checked?

34:03.300 --> 34:04.266
When maintenance
was last done on this?

34:04.400 --> 34:05.967
I think we should go get
a report on that.

34:06.100 --> 34:07.033
Figure it out, come back,

34:07.166 --> 34:08.100
or maybe we just don't
come back.

34:08.233 --> 34:09.333
We just don't come back at all--

34:09.467 --> 34:10.900
No, no, no, look...

34:11.033 --> 34:12.233
You're gonna do great,

34:12.367 --> 34:14.433
and this is gonna be amazing.

34:14.567 --> 34:16.333
Look, we'll just take it

34:16.467 --> 34:19.633
like one foot
in front of the other, okay?

34:19.767 --> 34:20.934
We just need to focus.

34:21.066 --> 34:23.166
Just like I tell
my athletic students.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.834
Not to listen to the fear voice
inside of their head,

34:25.967 --> 34:27.700
and worry about
what could happen--

34:27.834 --> 34:28.867
Why? What could happen?

34:29.000 --> 34:29.934
No, no, that's the point.

34:30.066 --> 34:31.166
Not to listen to the voice.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.467
Right?

34:32.600 --> 34:34.667
Just keep your eye on the ball,

34:34.800 --> 34:36.767
or in this case, the bridge.

34:38.834 --> 34:40.266
You ready?

34:42.533 --> 34:44.633
Not even close.

34:44.767 --> 34:46.867
Great.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.233
Okay.

34:56.133 --> 34:57.700
I'm on a bridge.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.200
I'm on a bridge,
I'm on a bridge.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.333
I'm just gonna walk
on the bridge.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.033
There's--
It's actually not a bridge.

35:03.166 --> 35:05.400
It's just, um... solid ground,

35:05.533 --> 35:07.333
solid ground,
all the way underneath, yeah.

35:07.467 --> 35:09.667
Okay, I got this.

35:09.800 --> 35:10.767
Don't look down.

35:12.266 --> 35:13.734
That's good, really good.

35:13.867 --> 35:15.233
This is not bad.

35:15.367 --> 35:16.333
It's not so bad.

35:16.467 --> 35:17.433
This isn't so bad.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.333
Okay, no, it's bad,
it's bad, it's really bad,

35:22.467 --> 35:23.500
it's really bad--

35:23.633 --> 35:24.300
Taylor, how are you doing
back there?

35:24.433 --> 35:26.100
I'm great!

35:26.233 --> 35:28.734
♪ London Bridge
is falling down ♪

35:28.867 --> 35:31.033
♪ Falling down
falling down... ♪

35:31.166 --> 35:33.200
Nope! No falling.

35:33.333 --> 35:34.367
I'm so sorry.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.667
I don't, I don't know
if I can do this.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.734
I don't think I can.

35:36.867 --> 35:39.033
I gotta-- I, um...
Ooh! I can't do it.

35:39.166 --> 35:39.934
Can't do it.

35:40.066 --> 35:41.500
Just gonna stay right here.

35:41.633 --> 35:43.233
No, no, no, it's okay,
you can do it.

35:43.367 --> 35:44.934
I'm done.
We did it. We did it.

35:45.066 --> 35:47.166
Can I go home now?

35:47.300 --> 35:48.734
No, you can do this.

35:48.867 --> 35:50.600
Come on, you can do it.

35:50.734 --> 35:52.433
Uh... we'll do it together.

35:52.567 --> 35:53.667
No, that would be cheating,
right?

35:53.800 --> 35:55.100
You know what,
I'm fine with cheating.

35:55.233 --> 35:56.867
I'm just gonna hold
your, um... pinky finger.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.333
- Pinky finger...
- Okay, okay.

35:58.467 --> 36:00.800
Whoa, that is a strong grip.

36:00.934 --> 36:01.967
Sorry, I'm just
thinking about the fact

36:02.100 --> 36:03.233
that there's nothing
underneath us,

36:03.367 --> 36:05.333
and what would happen
if it would all fall down,

36:05.467 --> 36:06.433
♪ And falling down...

36:06.567 --> 36:07.500
and there would be nothing
to catch us--

36:07.633 --> 36:09.633
No, no, no.
We're not singing that again.

36:09.767 --> 36:11.433
Look, how about
I spot you, okay,

36:11.567 --> 36:13.800
and I promise you
you're not going to fall.

36:13.934 --> 36:14.667
Think about it like this--

36:14.800 --> 36:16.166
Remember what I said?

36:16.300 --> 36:17.867
One foot in front of the other.

36:18.000 --> 36:18.967
One foot, next foot...

36:19.100 --> 36:21.000
- One foot...
- One foot.

36:21.133 --> 36:22.767
- Next foot.
- Next foot. Mm-hmm.

36:22.900 --> 36:23.633
You're doing great.

36:23.767 --> 36:24.567
Okay.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.467
Yeah, I am.
I'm doing it.

36:27.367 --> 36:29.066
You know, sometimes
fear takes over,

36:29.200 --> 36:30.166
and then it limits you

36:30.300 --> 36:32.200
to be able to see
beautiful things like this.

36:32.333 --> 36:33.433
Right, you're doing it.

36:33.567 --> 36:34.333
You're like a pro.

36:34.467 --> 36:35.567
I kinda am, right?

36:35.700 --> 36:36.467
Yeah.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.333
Oh!

36:37.467 --> 36:39.633
We need proof.

36:39.767 --> 36:40.500
Yeah, I should take a photo.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.166
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.000
Be careful.

36:43.133 --> 36:44.166
Okay, just...

36:44.300 --> 36:45.934
Okay, why don't you
hold onto here?

36:46.066 --> 36:48.567
Great. Great...

36:51.667 --> 36:53.567
Just gonna take a...

36:53.700 --> 36:54.734
- Great.
- Okay.

36:56.300 --> 36:58.233
- You're doing great!
- Okay, thanks!

36:58.367 --> 36:59.166
- Doing great.
- Okay.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.033
- You gonna hold my hand?
- Yeah.

37:01.166 --> 37:02.200
All right.

37:02.333 --> 37:03.467
Just, like nothin', right?

37:03.600 --> 37:04.400
Like nothin'.

37:04.533 --> 37:05.333
Just on a bridge.

37:05.467 --> 37:06.734
You're on a bridge.

37:07.867 --> 37:08.734
It's really high up.

37:08.867 --> 37:09.734
Wanna look down?

37:09.867 --> 37:10.900
I don't want to look down.

37:11.033 --> 37:12.133
Too far?

37:12.266 --> 37:13.633
- Too far, too soon.
- Okay.

37:15.100 --> 37:15.934
M'lady.

37:16.066 --> 37:16.867
Thank you.

37:18.367 --> 37:20.533
I don't know about you
but I am exhausted.

37:20.667 --> 37:22.400
It's the good
kind of exhausted, you know?

37:22.533 --> 37:24.333
The exhaustion you get
after a day with no worries,

37:24.467 --> 37:25.467
and just fun.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.000
Maybe we should do it
again sometime.

37:27.133 --> 37:28.233
We could bring Chloe.

37:28.367 --> 37:30.767
Unless you think
she'd be too scared.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.867
It would probably
freak her out.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.467
But if we show her
that we can do it...

37:34.600 --> 37:35.700
Now you're thinking
like a parent,

37:35.834 --> 37:37.667
being the brave one
when the kids are scared.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.633
I don't know if
I'd call myself "brave", but...

37:40.767 --> 37:42.066
Hey, you let me spot you.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.200
I know, I was clearly
delirious with fear.

37:44.333 --> 37:45.500
Ha ha.

37:46.667 --> 37:48.367
Well, I should
go get dinner ready

37:48.500 --> 37:49.533
before Chloe gets dropped off,

37:49.667 --> 37:51.400
but, uh, if you need help

37:51.533 --> 37:52.767
with any more
of those challenges,

37:52.900 --> 37:53.867
you know where to find me.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.033
Sure.

37:55.166 --> 37:56.066
All right.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.500
Oh, uh, in fact,

37:57.633 --> 37:59.967
we should probably
exchange numbers,

38:00.166 --> 38:02.567
you know,
for emergency purposes.

38:02.700 --> 38:03.767
Yeah.
No, totally.

38:03.900 --> 38:04.967
That's, um...

38:05.100 --> 38:06.200
that's what neighbors do, right?

38:06.333 --> 38:07.533
Mm-hmm.

38:07.667 --> 38:08.900
Here.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.467
There you go.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.033
- Thank you. I'll text you mine.
- Okay.

38:15.166 --> 38:16.533
Thank you again.

38:16.667 --> 38:18.433
Good night.

38:18.567 --> 38:20.233
'Night.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.734
Good morning.

38:26.867 --> 38:29.533
This is your daily
affirmation guide.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.900
Life is about moving on,

38:33.033 --> 38:34.233
accepting change,

38:34.367 --> 38:36.400
and looking forward
to what makes you stronger

38:36.533 --> 38:37.834
and more complete.

38:37.967 --> 38:42.000
The secret of change
is to focus all your energy,

38:42.133 --> 38:43.100
not fighting the old,

38:43.233 --> 38:45.667
but building on the new.

38:58.233 --> 39:01.300
We are going to take
our final deep breath in,

39:01.433 --> 39:03.200
and release...

39:22.467 --> 39:23.400
"Play Hooky for a Day,

39:23.533 --> 39:27.567
and Do Nothing or Anything".

39:27.700 --> 39:28.633
So the custom built-ins
you ordered

39:28.767 --> 39:29.734
for the Schwartzs

39:29.867 --> 39:31.000
are scheduled
to be delivered today,

39:31.133 --> 39:32.900
and I just got a message
from the Vernons.

39:33.033 --> 39:34.567
They want to go ahead with
that estimate you gave them.

39:34.700 --> 39:35.834
Should I book a follow-up?

39:36.834 --> 39:38.266
I need to take a day off.

39:39.700 --> 39:40.600
Wait, what?

39:40.734 --> 39:42.333
- You do?
- I do.

39:42.467 --> 39:43.667
Is everything okay?

39:43.800 --> 39:44.667
Yeah.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.033
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

39:47.166 --> 39:49.333
I just need to take a day...

39:49.467 --> 39:51.533
to do...

39:51.667 --> 39:53.800
something.

39:53.934 --> 39:56.633
Okay, well, that's great,

39:56.767 --> 39:57.567
and don't worry,

39:57.700 --> 39:59.066
I can totally
pick up the slack.

40:00.266 --> 40:01.266
Okay...

40:01.400 --> 40:03.734
Okay.

40:03.867 --> 40:07.233
So, I'm going to take this
for today,

40:07.367 --> 40:08.400
and you go do

40:08.533 --> 40:10.066
whatever it is
that you're gonna do, okay?

40:10.200 --> 40:12.166
O...kay.

40:12.300 --> 40:14.233
Okay.

40:14.367 --> 40:15.800
It's gonna be okay, right?

40:15.934 --> 40:17.567
- It will be fine.
- Okay.

40:17.700 --> 40:18.800
Don't worry.

40:18.934 --> 40:20.600
This is exactly
what you hired me for, okay?

40:20.734 --> 40:22.000
Not to pick up phones,

40:22.133 --> 40:23.633
but to help with the jobs,

40:23.767 --> 40:25.734
I promise you
I will not let you down.

40:25.867 --> 40:28.633
No, I know.
I'm sorry, I know.

40:28.767 --> 40:30.767
Thank you.

40:31.867 --> 40:33.033
Okay.

40:33.166 --> 40:34.667
So, yeah.

40:34.800 --> 40:35.667
Okay.

40:35.800 --> 40:36.767
Ah, ah, ah!

40:40.166 --> 40:40.900
There we go.

40:41.033 --> 40:41.867
Okay.

40:42.000 --> 40:42.834
Go ahead.

40:42.967 --> 40:43.800
Okay, okay.

40:43.934 --> 40:44.734
Go enjoy doing nothing.

40:44.867 --> 40:45.700
Oh, my goodness.

40:45.834 --> 40:47.500
- Absolutely nothing!
- Yup.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.166
Nope.

41:50.734 --> 41:52.233
Hey, neighbor!

41:52.367 --> 41:53.100
Hey!

41:53.233 --> 41:54.266
No work?

41:54.400 --> 41:56.400
Pro D. day at the school,

41:56.533 --> 41:58.800
so I thought I'd tackle a job
that I can handle.

42:00.633 --> 42:01.500
What about you?

42:01.633 --> 42:03.000
Are you playing hooky?

42:03.133 --> 42:04.200
I... It's, um... no,

42:04.333 --> 42:05.367
it's my next challenge.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.700
I have to take a day off
to do whatever I want.

42:07.834 --> 42:09.333
Oh, so you're saying
you ignored your day-timer?

42:09.467 --> 42:11.767
I... I did. I...

42:11.900 --> 42:13.300
Well, I gave it to my assistant,

42:13.433 --> 42:14.800
and I just called him.

42:14.934 --> 42:17.100
Everything's fine.
Everything's totally fine.

42:17.233 --> 42:18.100
Well, that's great.

42:18.233 --> 42:19.867
So, what are you going to do?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.133
I am going to learn
how to make sushi.

42:22.266 --> 42:25.200
I figured I'd shake up
my lunch menu.

42:25.333 --> 42:26.333
Really?

42:26.467 --> 42:27.800
Well, if you need someone
to taste test them,

42:27.934 --> 42:28.900
I'm your man.

42:29.033 --> 42:31.867
Or... if you're not busy,
you could help.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
I'm in,

42:33.133 --> 42:35.800
but I gotta warn you,
I can't cook,

42:35.934 --> 42:38.033
and I'm an even bigger mess
in the kitchen

42:38.166 --> 42:39.300
than anywhere else.

42:39.433 --> 42:40.300
Oh.

42:40.433 --> 42:41.867
Think you can handle it?

42:42.000 --> 42:43.033
I'll try.

42:43.166 --> 42:44.300
Hmm.

42:45.834 --> 42:47.200
Okay.

42:48.300 --> 42:50.600
The Tupperware in there
is a work of art.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.200
I can't stop staring.

42:52.333 --> 42:53.467
Okay, well...

42:53.600 --> 42:56.300
ogling it is giving it
the wrong impression.

42:56.433 --> 42:57.700
Sorry.

42:57.834 --> 42:59.500
Okay...

42:59.633 --> 43:01.033
"Spicy tuna rolls."

43:01.166 --> 43:02.233
Do you think maybe

43:02.367 --> 43:03.533
we should tackle something
a little bit easier,

43:03.667 --> 43:05.800
say, I don't know,
like a grilled cheese?

43:05.934 --> 43:07.000
Here you go.

43:07.133 --> 43:08.000
All right, sushi it is.

43:08.133 --> 43:08.934
Yes.

43:09.066 --> 43:11.233
Put the mat down...

43:11.367 --> 43:12.667
Oh, I should wash my hands.

43:12.800 --> 43:16.066
...then you take
a piece of seaweed,

43:16.200 --> 43:19.100
and you lay that on your mat.

43:19.233 --> 43:21.200
Geez, this is like
tacky paper.

43:22.367 --> 43:24.266
Your hand's wet, that's why.

43:24.400 --> 43:25.533
Here. I got it.

43:25.667 --> 43:26.600
Here, just...

43:26.734 --> 43:29.667
give it a little dry.

43:31.367 --> 43:33.734
Okay, uh... The, uh...

43:33.867 --> 43:34.734
What are we...

43:34.867 --> 43:35.934
We have to make rice.

43:36.066 --> 43:37.300
Rice. We have to make rice.

43:37.433 --> 43:39.200
Oh, that I can do.

43:39.333 --> 43:40.533
Right.

44:16.266 --> 44:18.734
Okay, there.
One for you, one for me.

44:20.433 --> 44:22.333
Should we eat them
or should we frame them?

44:22.467 --> 44:23.333
They look so nice.

44:23.467 --> 44:25.100
How about both?

44:25.233 --> 44:26.133
Oh, wait.

44:26.266 --> 44:27.400
You should be in there,

44:27.533 --> 44:30.066
as proof that you took a day
to do whatever you wanted.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.667
All right, well then,
you should be in there, too.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.367
- Well, all right then.
- Mm-hmm.

44:35.266 --> 44:38.066
Say... "spicy tuna".

44:38.200 --> 44:39.066
Spicy tuna!

44:39.200 --> 44:41.633
Spicy tuna!

44:41.767 --> 44:43.600
That's so silly.

44:45.834 --> 44:48.233
Well, this is
the most fun and success

44:48.367 --> 44:49.667
that I've ever had
in the kitchen.

44:49.800 --> 44:52.000
Except for the rice.

44:52.133 --> 44:53.000
Yeah.

44:53.133 --> 44:54.600
But I should get going,

44:54.734 --> 44:57.834
because to be honest with you,
I'm the one who's playing hooky.

44:57.967 --> 44:59.400
Oh, I thought you had
a PD day.

44:59.533 --> 45:00.333
I do,

45:00.467 --> 45:01.533
but I promised myself

45:01.667 --> 45:03.867
that I would finish unpacking
all the boxes,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.700
which, of course, is why
I was changing a light bulb.

45:06.834 --> 45:10.000
But I've lost something
over there in that mess

45:10.133 --> 45:12.066
that I have to go find,
so, um...

45:12.200 --> 45:13.133
thank you.

45:13.266 --> 45:15.000
This was... this was great.

45:15.133 --> 45:15.834
Cool.

45:15.967 --> 45:17.133
Well, I could help you.

45:17.266 --> 45:18.800
I mean, it's what I do,

45:18.934 --> 45:20.867
and I feel like
if we did it together,

45:21.000 --> 45:22.967
it would be
so much more efficient.

45:23.100 --> 45:24.934
Well, this is your day
to do whatever you wanted.

45:25.066 --> 45:25.967
I mean, I couldn't ask you

45:26.100 --> 45:27.867
to come over there
and help me work.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
It's not work.

45:29.133 --> 45:31.000
I mean, I love what I do,
so it wouldn't be work.

45:31.133 --> 45:33.333
Well, I'm not going
to talk you out of it.

45:33.467 --> 45:34.567
Great!

45:34.700 --> 45:36.500
Uh... we'll grab few boxes

45:36.633 --> 45:38.300
and some containers,
my label-maker,

45:38.433 --> 45:39.667
and we'll get to it!

45:39.800 --> 45:41.433
Yes!

45:45.533 --> 45:47.200
I wonder how
all this Christmas stuff

45:47.333 --> 45:49.467
got labeled kitchen stuff.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.734
Maybe the Christmas mugs
threw you?

45:51.867 --> 45:53.400
I'm gonna go with that.

45:56.500 --> 45:58.533
So, um...

45:58.667 --> 46:02.033
how does Sara fit
into yours and Chloe's life?

46:02.166 --> 46:06.266
Well, Sara was Claire's
best friend in college,

46:06.400 --> 46:07.867
so she's been
a part of our lives

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
since...

46:09.133 --> 46:11.066
well, I can remember when.

46:11.200 --> 46:12.967
Now she's just
so great with Chloe,

46:13.100 --> 46:15.800
and, you know,
I kind of needed that.

46:15.934 --> 46:19.300
You know,
knowing that Chloe has a...

46:19.433 --> 46:20.900
mother-like figure.

46:21.033 --> 46:22.233
Hmm.

46:23.934 --> 46:25.467
That makes sense.

46:27.266 --> 46:28.900
Wow, is that it?

46:29.033 --> 46:30.100
Are we done?

46:30.233 --> 46:32.233
No more boxes to unpack,

46:32.367 --> 46:33.467
or, uh, to label?

46:33.600 --> 46:35.400
We are done.

46:35.533 --> 46:39.800
Wow, I'm feeling
a little emotional here.

46:39.934 --> 46:42.467
That's why it's very important
to stay organized.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.033
Sure, or sometimes,

46:44.166 --> 46:45.633
you can just fly
by the seat of your pants,

46:45.767 --> 46:47.166
and see what the day brings.

46:48.667 --> 46:50.066
Another box?

46:50.200 --> 46:51.967
How did we miss this?

46:54.767 --> 46:56.200
Oh...

46:56.333 --> 46:58.066
Wow, I've been...

46:58.200 --> 47:00.233
I've been looking for this.

47:01.333 --> 47:02.367
Is that your wife's, or...

47:04.333 --> 47:05.734
No, it, um...

47:05.867 --> 47:08.567
Hello!

47:11.400 --> 47:12.600
- Hi!
- Taylor!

47:12.734 --> 47:14.166
Hi! Oh!
Hi!

47:14.300 --> 47:16.533
Hey. what am I,
chopped liver?

47:16.667 --> 47:18.033
- Dad...
- Ah...

47:18.166 --> 47:20.166
Josh, did you
put everything away?

47:20.300 --> 47:21.767
I did, yeah,

47:21.900 --> 47:22.767
with the help of an expert.

47:22.900 --> 47:24.600
It's what I do.

47:24.734 --> 47:26.066
It's my company,
"Space to Live."

47:27.500 --> 47:28.834
Whoa...

47:28.967 --> 47:29.834
Impressive, right?

47:29.967 --> 47:32.734
I can find the cookies,
and the chips!

47:32.867 --> 47:34.500
Okay, but don't forget,
it's almost dinner.

47:34.633 --> 47:36.633
Which I picked up on the way.

47:36.767 --> 47:37.867
Oh.

47:39.333 --> 47:42.000
And on that note,
I have a ton of sushi to eat.

47:42.133 --> 47:43.633
Which I helped make.

47:43.767 --> 47:44.767
Really?

47:44.900 --> 47:46.233
Yeah, we have photo proof.

47:46.367 --> 47:47.333
Yup.

47:47.467 --> 47:48.500
Taylor...

47:48.633 --> 47:50.166
I picked my topic.

47:50.300 --> 47:51.467
I'm still writing
what I'm wanna say,

47:51.600 --> 47:52.867
but when I'm ready,
can I practice on you?

47:53.000 --> 47:54.533
Of course, yeah.

47:54.667 --> 47:55.467
Great!

47:55.600 --> 47:56.533
I'm gonna work on it now.

47:56.667 --> 47:58.000
Okay.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.700
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna go...

48:03.834 --> 48:04.767
Yeah.

48:04.900 --> 48:05.633
Oh, hey,

48:05.767 --> 48:07.600
don't forget to take the day

48:07.734 --> 48:09.367
to do whatever you want.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.133
I won't.

48:17.033 --> 48:20.700
Chloe doesn't seem shy
around your new neighbor.

48:20.834 --> 48:22.700
No, Taylor and her, uh,
they clicked right away,

48:22.834 --> 48:23.700
and it's great,

48:23.834 --> 48:24.734
'cause she's just
across the street.

48:24.867 --> 48:26.266
Yeah.

48:26.400 --> 48:31.700
Yeah, of course.

49:13.166 --> 49:15.767
So, I got the Kellermans
to sign off

49:15.900 --> 49:17.333
on the hidden buffet
and the floating shelves,

49:17.467 --> 49:19.133
and since you weren't here,

49:19.266 --> 49:21.567
I put together some drawings
for the Jareds' module.

49:24.166 --> 49:26.500
This is great.

49:26.633 --> 49:29.533
I told you, you didn't just
hire me for my charm.

49:29.667 --> 49:30.600
So, how was your day off?

49:30.734 --> 49:32.867
Amazing.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.133
Josh and I made sushi,

49:34.266 --> 49:36.867
and then we unpacked
the rest of his house,

49:37.000 --> 49:38.367
and I helped him get organized.

49:38.500 --> 49:40.200
Sounds like a day full of Josh.

49:40.333 --> 49:42.200
Yeah, well, he had a PD day
from school, so...

49:42.333 --> 49:44.166
Oh, so you guys had,
like, a little playdate?

49:44.300 --> 49:45.266
Nope.

49:45.400 --> 49:46.266
It's not like that.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.166
Isn't it?

49:47.300 --> 49:48.433
It's not, no.

49:48.567 --> 49:50.433
I, um...

49:50.567 --> 49:53.300
I found a ring
in one of the boxes.

49:53.433 --> 49:54.433
An engagement ring.

49:54.567 --> 49:56.433
For...?

49:56.567 --> 49:59.300
I'm guessing
it's for this woman, Sara.

49:59.433 --> 50:01.233
Oh, so she's his girlfriend.

50:01.367 --> 50:03.033
I... I don't know.

50:03.166 --> 50:04.600
So how do you know
that the ring is for her?

50:04.734 --> 50:05.700
Because he said

50:05.834 --> 50:08.433
that she's like a mother figure
to Chloe,

50:08.567 --> 50:10.834
and that that's something
that he really wants,

50:10.967 --> 50:14.533
and he hid the ring
when she came home, so...

50:14.667 --> 50:15.533
So, in all this sharing,

50:15.667 --> 50:17.133
he never mentioned
he's in love with her?

50:17.266 --> 50:18.967
No, but he's gotta be, right?

50:21.333 --> 50:23.100
Taylor, look,

50:23.233 --> 50:25.433
growing up,
I was a huge troublemaker,

50:25.567 --> 50:26.967
like, I drove my mom crazy,

50:27.100 --> 50:30.667
but no matter what I did,
she always had my back,

50:30.800 --> 50:31.834
and she told me it's because

50:31.967 --> 50:33.834
the love for her child
supersedes everything.

50:33.967 --> 50:36.033
So maybe
he's just doing it for Chloe.

50:36.166 --> 50:37.767
You know, it gives him
some sort of comfort,

50:37.900 --> 50:41.166
but being comfortable
is not being in love.

50:41.300 --> 50:42.600
So try asking him out,

50:42.734 --> 50:44.633
get him outside
of his comfort zone,

50:44.767 --> 50:46.500
and it'll get you
outside of the friend zone--

50:46.633 --> 50:48.166
I can't do that.

50:48.300 --> 50:49.100
Of course you can.

50:49.233 --> 50:50.700
Really? I can?
Can you?

50:50.834 --> 50:52.333
Is that how you do it,

50:52.467 --> 50:54.333
with all your texting
and emojis?

50:54.467 --> 50:55.934
Okay, that's different.

50:56.066 --> 50:57.100
How is that different?

50:57.233 --> 50:59.200
You won't even get out
from your phone zone.

50:59.333 --> 51:01.333
You won't even go on a date.

51:02.800 --> 51:04.100
Touché.

51:05.200 --> 51:07.367
Touché...

51:14.900 --> 51:18.266
Yeah, Chloe! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

51:18.400 --> 51:19.333
Okay,

51:19.467 --> 51:20.533
we're ready
for the presentation,

51:20.667 --> 51:21.567
and I promise this time,

51:21.700 --> 51:23.133
no monkey business.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.100
- Sit on your hands.
- Okay.

51:28.467 --> 51:30.834
My presentation
is about my dad.

51:32.734 --> 51:34.200
My dad is the greatest,

51:34.333 --> 51:35.700
because he does everything.

51:35.834 --> 51:38.900
He's a teacher and a coach.

51:39.033 --> 51:40.834
He works at the college,

51:40.967 --> 51:44.100
but he's also like a teacher
at home.

51:45.233 --> 51:47.367
He teaches me
how to look after myself,

51:47.500 --> 51:51.066
and to be a good person,

51:51.200 --> 51:53.533
and he teaches me
how not to be afraid.

51:55.166 --> 51:56.600
My dad also always smiles,

51:56.734 --> 51:58.934
and it makes me feel better,

51:59.066 --> 52:01.767
because that's what my dad does.

52:01.900 --> 52:03.433
He thinks about
what makes me happy.

52:05.266 --> 52:07.066
That's why I want him
to be happy, too.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.667
Because I love him the most.

52:11.800 --> 52:15.100
That's why I chose him
for my presentation.

52:17.767 --> 52:19.667
Wow...

52:20.533 --> 52:22.900
That was amazing.

52:23.033 --> 52:24.900
Yeah, A-plus, A-plus.

52:25.033 --> 52:26.333
Come give me a hug.

52:26.467 --> 52:28.500
I love you so much.

52:28.633 --> 52:30.400
It really was,

52:30.533 --> 52:33.767
and I know that, obviously,
you're going to do great,

52:33.900 --> 52:35.834
but if...

52:35.967 --> 52:37.867
you need a little help...

52:38.000 --> 52:40.400
I got you this.

52:41.800 --> 52:42.967
What is that?

52:43.100 --> 52:44.667
It's a worry angel.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.834
I have one, too.

52:46.967 --> 52:49.767
Basically,

52:49.900 --> 52:53.567
you know, if you ever get
anxious or nervous,

52:53.700 --> 52:55.000
or any of those things,

52:55.133 --> 52:56.567
then you just rub it,

52:56.700 --> 52:58.200
and the angel
takes your worries away.

53:00.533 --> 53:01.533
Thank you, Taylor.

53:01.667 --> 53:02.834
I'm going to go see it
in the mirror.

53:02.967 --> 53:04.100
Okay.

53:07.200 --> 53:08.467
What?

53:08.600 --> 53:09.800
That was amazing.

53:09.934 --> 53:11.834
She is so sweet.

53:11.967 --> 53:13.734
Yeah.

53:13.867 --> 53:16.166
And, uh, thank you for that.

53:16.300 --> 53:17.200
That was
very thoughtful of you.

53:17.333 --> 53:18.800
Oh, of course, yeah.

53:18.934 --> 53:20.300
I mean, it'd be great

53:20.433 --> 53:22.300
if she could get over
all of her fears at once,

53:22.433 --> 53:25.133
but it's nice to know it's there
if you need it, you know?

53:28.633 --> 53:31.233
So, what's next
on the time capsule challenge?

53:31.367 --> 53:32.133
Uh, you know what,

53:32.266 --> 53:33.834
I haven't, uh,

53:33.967 --> 53:35.533
I haven't actually
opened it yet,

53:35.667 --> 53:36.633
but I have it with me.

53:36.767 --> 53:37.667
Do you want to open it?

53:38.667 --> 53:39.767
Okay.

53:40.867 --> 53:43.433
Let's see...

53:45.700 --> 53:47.367
What's it say?

53:47.500 --> 53:50.233
It says "Join a Team".

53:50.367 --> 53:51.233
That's not too hard.

53:51.367 --> 53:52.333
No.

53:53.834 --> 53:55.834
Uh...

53:55.967 --> 53:58.500
I'm not exactly
a team player, so...

53:58.633 --> 54:01.066
Well, being on a team
can be fun, right, Chloe?

54:01.200 --> 54:02.867
Yeah, especially
if my dad's coaching.

54:04.033 --> 54:05.133
So, just do that.

54:05.266 --> 54:06.633
You know, join a league.

54:06.767 --> 54:08.533
There's always something
going on in the city.

54:08.667 --> 54:09.867
Baseball,

54:10.000 --> 54:11.100
or ultimate Frisbee--

54:11.233 --> 54:13.734
Okay, well, I'm not exactly
sporty, so that's...

54:13.867 --> 54:14.967
Oh, come on,

54:15.100 --> 54:16.367
I saw you throw
that ball at the gym.

54:16.500 --> 54:17.767
You're a natural.

54:17.900 --> 54:20.266
I wouldn't say that.

54:20.400 --> 54:22.033
Well... let's find out.

54:23.100 --> 54:25.633
Chloe and I can show you.

54:30.567 --> 54:32.166
Come on, girls! Let's go!

54:32.300 --> 54:34.100
Let's get a basket, Edie,
come on!

54:34.233 --> 54:35.300
Give a pass!

54:35.433 --> 54:36.367
Nice pass!

54:36.500 --> 54:37.767
Look out for Sophie!

54:37.900 --> 54:38.767
Look for who's open.

54:38.900 --> 54:39.800
Perfect!

54:39.934 --> 54:41.233
Throw it up!

54:41.367 --> 54:42.867
Oh! Grab the rebound!

54:43.000 --> 54:44.066
Good points!

54:45.867 --> 54:47.200
Come on, girls!

54:50.500 --> 54:51.233
Pass the ball,
that's right, get your hands up.

54:51.367 --> 54:52.734
Get your hands up.

54:52.867 --> 54:53.934
- Hi.
- Hey!

54:54.066 --> 54:56.100
So... right?

54:56.233 --> 54:58.100
What do you think?

54:58.233 --> 54:59.867
This is Little League.

55:00.066 --> 55:01.266
Yeah, I'm a coach of all ages.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.700
That's right, girls,
keep going, come on.

55:02.834 --> 55:03.834
Good job.

55:03.967 --> 55:05.834
I don't really get
what I'm doing here?

55:05.967 --> 55:06.867
Well, in this league,

55:07.000 --> 55:08.533
there's no winners or losers.

55:08.667 --> 55:10.600
The kids are here
just to have fun.

55:10.734 --> 55:11.667
Good job, girls.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.266
Get your hands up,
get your hands up.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.200
Um... I'm not a kid, though.

55:16.333 --> 55:18.367
Yeah, but we're all
still kids at heart, right?

55:18.500 --> 55:20.166
But that's beside the point.

55:20.300 --> 55:22.333
Today, you'll feel like
a kid again,

55:22.467 --> 55:24.367
and be an honorary member
of this team.

55:25.433 --> 55:27.033
Good job, good job,
keep going.

55:27.166 --> 55:28.300
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

55:28.433 --> 55:31.266
Uh...
I don't know that...

55:31.400 --> 55:32.333
Come on, here,

55:32.467 --> 55:33.633
put your jersey on,
get out there,

55:33.767 --> 55:34.667
and start practicing
with the team.

55:34.800 --> 55:35.767
Come on, hustle,
hustle, hustle, come on!

55:35.900 --> 55:37.700
I don't know, these kids,

55:37.834 --> 55:39.800
they don't want
to play with me, that's weird.

55:39.934 --> 55:41.967
Come on, Taylor!

55:42.100 --> 55:43.100
See?

55:43.233 --> 55:44.800
Does that ease your stress?

55:44.934 --> 55:46.133
Come on, put the jersey on.

55:46.266 --> 55:48.033
- Okay.
- Hustle, hustle, hustle!

55:54.400 --> 55:55.300
Good job, Chloe.

55:56.467 --> 55:57.600
- Pass it to Taylor.
- Taylor.

55:57.734 --> 55:59.433
There you go!

55:59.567 --> 56:01.734
Come on, girls.

56:01.867 --> 56:02.934
It's okay.

56:03.066 --> 56:04.166
Shoot it up, put it up!

56:04.300 --> 56:05.166
Oh...

56:07.333 --> 56:08.433
To Chloe.

56:08.567 --> 56:09.467
Okay, Chloe...

56:09.600 --> 56:10.433
Go to Taylor.

56:10.567 --> 56:11.567
Come on, Taylor, shoot!

56:22.667 --> 56:24.567
One, two, three--

56:24.700 --> 56:26.033
Swish!

56:26.166 --> 56:29.600
Whoo!

56:29.734 --> 56:31.867
- Good job, good job.
- Nice job.

56:33.433 --> 56:34.367
All right, thanks again, guys.

56:34.500 --> 56:36.066
We'll see you next week,

56:36.200 --> 56:37.967
and get Brenda
to practice that dribble.

56:41.166 --> 56:42.900
I can't believe I did that.

56:43.033 --> 56:44.100
I played on a team.

56:44.233 --> 56:45.400
- I dribbled...
- Yeah.

56:45.533 --> 56:47.867
I passed a ball
to another human being.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.567
I scored a basket?

56:49.700 --> 56:51.166
You were rocking it
like a team player.

56:51.300 --> 56:53.300
I know, I really was...

56:54.567 --> 56:55.433
and it was fun.

56:55.567 --> 56:56.433
Yeah.

56:56.567 --> 56:58.700
Playing on a team
can be fun.

56:58.834 --> 57:01.567
You know, it can give you
a sense of belonging,

57:01.700 --> 57:03.900
and help boost your self-esteem.

57:04.033 --> 57:05.934
Overall,
it's just a great feeling.

57:06.066 --> 57:08.166
I feel that.

57:10.700 --> 57:12.600
So, uh, what are you up to
for the rest of your day?

57:12.734 --> 57:13.967
I'm actually going to go
see my dad,

57:14.100 --> 57:16.100
show off some of
those completed challenges.

57:16.233 --> 57:18.000
Do you and Chloe want to come?

57:18.133 --> 57:20.133
Seeing as you're maybe
a little responsible

57:20.266 --> 57:21.166
for my success.

57:21.300 --> 57:22.734
A little?

57:22.867 --> 57:24.066
I mean, barely worth a mention.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.033
Really?

57:25.166 --> 57:26.800
Okay, well, maybe I should come,

57:26.934 --> 57:28.467
just to make sure
that I get my credit.

57:28.600 --> 57:29.433
Great.

57:29.567 --> 57:30.734
I think you should.

57:33.400 --> 57:34.467
You really did score.

57:34.600 --> 57:39.767
Yeah, I did.

57:41.934 --> 57:42.967
Hi, Dad.

57:43.100 --> 57:45.934
Hey, guys!

57:46.066 --> 57:47.533
These are my new friends
I told you about.

57:47.667 --> 57:49.934
This is Chloe and Josh.

57:50.066 --> 57:50.834
I'm real pleased to meet you.

57:50.967 --> 57:51.934
You as well.

57:52.066 --> 57:54.133
We've heard lots about you,
haven't we?

57:54.266 --> 57:55.867
Do you like to paint?

57:56.000 --> 57:56.967
That's great,

57:57.100 --> 57:58.200
because I have
a lot of paints and paper

57:58.333 --> 57:59.767
we need to get rid of.

57:59.900 --> 58:02.200
Come and help me
make some art.

58:02.333 --> 58:04.400
Wow, all these are your dad's?

58:04.533 --> 58:05.500
Yeah.

58:06.667 --> 58:08.600
He can be as scattered
as he wants to be.

58:08.734 --> 58:10.300
These are incredible.

58:12.066 --> 58:14.433
I'm gonna guess that
that's your mom?

58:15.667 --> 58:16.567
Yeah.

58:16.700 --> 58:19.033
I can see the resemblance.

58:19.166 --> 58:20.166
She was beautiful.

58:23.867 --> 58:26.100
And you as a kid?

58:26.233 --> 58:28.066
Mm-hmm, yup, that's me

58:28.200 --> 58:32.033
on one of my long,
lonely forest walks.

58:32.166 --> 58:33.533
Did you spend a lot of time
by yourself as a kid?

58:33.667 --> 58:34.533
I did, yeah,

58:34.667 --> 58:36.266
and with my parents.

58:36.400 --> 58:39.400
For the elephants nails,
I'll bet, yeah?

58:39.533 --> 58:41.600
I was... quite attached.

58:42.967 --> 58:44.734
It didn't feel strange
at the time, but, um...

58:44.867 --> 58:46.367
I don't know,

58:46.500 --> 58:48.166
now I feel like
maybe I missed out a little

58:48.300 --> 58:49.300
on other things.

58:50.934 --> 58:52.667
- Taylor?
- Yeah?

58:52.800 --> 58:54.266
Can you come paint
a picture with us?

58:54.400 --> 58:55.300
Of course.

58:55.433 --> 58:56.600
What are we painting?

58:56.734 --> 58:57.433
Elephants!

58:57.567 --> 58:59.800
Of course, elephants, yes.

59:06.533 --> 59:07.667
- No...
- Show me.

59:07.800 --> 59:08.767
No, it's not ready yet.

59:08.900 --> 59:10.667
Oh.

59:10.800 --> 59:12.133
Some things take time.

59:12.266 --> 59:13.834
I got us some snacks.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.066
Thanks, Dad.

59:15.200 --> 59:17.667
You know, your daughter
shows some real talent.

59:17.800 --> 59:19.000
Take a look at that elephant.

59:19.133 --> 59:22.133
Look at the wrinkles
in the skin,

59:22.266 --> 59:24.300
and the different
shades of gray.

59:24.433 --> 59:26.467
It's awesome.

59:26.600 --> 59:28.433
Well, she does
come by it honestly.

59:28.567 --> 59:30.500
Look at this masterpiece.

59:31.867 --> 59:33.266
Oh...

59:33.400 --> 59:35.600
I think it's gonna be huge.

59:35.734 --> 59:38.166
You know what,
I think it's already been done,

59:38.300 --> 59:39.867
so maybe don't cash
your chips in just yet.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.166
Are you sure?

59:41.300 --> 59:42.333
I... think so.

59:44.934 --> 59:45.767
You know what,

59:45.900 --> 59:46.633
I can't help noticing

59:46.767 --> 59:48.233
that the three of you feel like

59:48.367 --> 59:51.233
you've known each other
for a long time.

59:51.367 --> 59:53.066
Yeah, It's come by
pretty honestly,

59:53.200 --> 59:55.266
and Taylor and Chloe
clicked right away, so...

59:58.066 --> 59:59.266
Kindred spirits?

59:59.400 --> 1:00:00.433
Yeah, maybe.

1:00:00.567 --> 1:00:02.200
Exactly.

1:00:04.033 --> 1:00:06.100
Me and Dad
have been helping Taylor

1:00:06.233 --> 1:00:07.333
with her time capsules.

1:00:07.467 --> 1:00:09.233
Speaking of the time capsule,

1:00:09.367 --> 1:00:11.367
do you want to open
the fifth challenge?

1:00:12.433 --> 1:00:13.967
Challenge number five?

1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:17.734
Here it goes.

1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:23.300
"Be spontaneous."

1:00:24.633 --> 1:00:26.266
Ooh, that one's not easy.

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:28.300
Um, have any of them been easy?

1:00:28.433 --> 1:00:31.967
So, what are you
going to do, Taylor?

1:00:32.100 --> 1:00:34.333
Um...

1:00:34.467 --> 1:00:37.433
I don't know.

1:00:37.567 --> 1:00:39.300
Well, that's
kind of the point, right?

1:00:39.433 --> 1:00:41.000
Oh, I know.

1:00:41.133 --> 1:00:42.500
What if...

1:00:42.633 --> 1:00:45.467
I go grocery shopping,

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:47.567
without a list?

1:00:49.967 --> 1:00:53.400
Come on, guys, think of
al the things that I could get,

1:00:53.533 --> 1:00:55.367
or not get.

1:00:55.500 --> 1:00:56.467
Yeah.

1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:58.633
Yeah, that sounds wild.

1:00:58.767 --> 1:01:02.800
Do whatever makes you
feel spontaneous, kitten.

1:01:02.934 --> 1:01:03.667
Whew.

1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:05.000
I'm gonna do this.

1:01:05.133 --> 1:01:07.300
You know...

1:01:07.433 --> 1:01:09.033
before you were born,

1:01:09.166 --> 1:01:10.900
your mother and I
used to get out a map,

1:01:11.033 --> 1:01:11.867
put it on the table,

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.367
the entire state before us,

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:15.333
she would close her eyes,

1:01:15.467 --> 1:01:17.166
and she would move
her finger around,

1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:18.834
and when she put it down,

1:01:18.967 --> 1:01:20.066
that is where we drove,

1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:21.166
without any plans

1:01:21.300 --> 1:01:22.867
other than the coordinates
on the map.

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.800
We ended up in some pretty
interesting places,

1:01:25.934 --> 1:01:27.000
let me tell you.

1:01:27.867 --> 1:01:29.166
I didn't know that.

1:01:29.300 --> 1:01:30.500
Yeah.

1:01:30.633 --> 1:01:32.400
Challenge accepted.

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:45.500
List shmist.

1:01:49.934 --> 1:01:52.266
No need to make a mess, though.

1:02:00.767 --> 1:02:01.633
All right, Mom,

1:02:01.767 --> 1:02:03.567
what am I supposed to make
with this?

1:02:17.467 --> 1:02:19.734
You want me to be spontaneous?

1:02:19.867 --> 1:02:22.467
I'll be spontaneous.

1:02:34.133 --> 1:02:37.100
Oh, yeah?

1:02:37.233 --> 1:02:38.467
A hamster?

1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:39.700
What's his name?

1:02:40.934 --> 1:02:43.767
Periwinkle?
That's funny.

1:02:43.900 --> 1:02:45.767
Okay, well, you have fun
with Jenny,

1:02:45.900 --> 1:02:46.867
and call me tomorrow,

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:47.734
and let me know
what time to pick you up.

1:02:47.867 --> 1:02:49.400
Hey, I love you.

1:02:49.533 --> 1:02:51.433
Okay, bye.

1:02:51.567 --> 1:02:52.266
Chloe on a playdate?

1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:54.100
Sleepover actually.

1:02:54.233 --> 1:02:56.867
It's the first one
in a while, so...

1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:58.767
How was your shopping trip?

1:02:58.900 --> 1:03:00.133
Oh, counter productive.

1:03:00.266 --> 1:03:01.000
Turns out you actually do
need a list

1:03:01.133 --> 1:03:02.000
to get what you need.

1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:03.734
But I did another challenge.

1:03:03.867 --> 1:03:05.934
I did that thing with the map

1:03:06.066 --> 1:03:07.467
that my mom and dad
used to do.

1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:08.500
And?

1:03:08.633 --> 1:03:11.400
And I landed here...

1:03:11.533 --> 1:03:12.367
Here?

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:13.967
Looks like nowhere, actually.

1:03:14.100 --> 1:03:14.934
I know, right?

1:03:15.066 --> 1:03:16.100
But that's perfect.

1:03:16.233 --> 1:03:19.900
Yeah, so I am off
on the road to nowhere.

1:03:20.033 --> 1:03:21.533
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1:03:21.667 --> 1:03:22.934
Unless...

1:03:23.066 --> 1:03:24.266
I mean, do you want to come?

1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:25.934
Unless you have stuff to do.

1:03:26.066 --> 1:03:26.800
I totally get it.

1:03:26.934 --> 1:03:27.867
Don't worry about it.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.200
No, actually, I would love to.

1:03:30.333 --> 1:03:32.700
I haven't been on a road trip
in forever,

1:03:32.834 --> 1:03:34.700
so yeah.

1:03:34.834 --> 1:03:35.767
Great. Let's do it!

1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:36.667
Let's do it.

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:37.633
My car.

1:03:37.767 --> 1:03:38.667
Right.

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:39.600
Cleaner.

1:03:39.734 --> 1:03:42.166
- Right. I mean...
- I guess.

1:03:48.834 --> 1:03:50.133
Okay, I got one.

1:03:50.266 --> 1:03:51.300
What did the waiter
say to the llama,

1:03:51.433 --> 1:03:52.734
after he finished his food
at the restaurant?

1:03:52.867 --> 1:03:54.300
I don't know.

1:03:54.433 --> 1:03:55.533
Alpaca that up for you.

1:03:55.667 --> 1:03:58.967
Oh... good one.

1:03:59.100 --> 1:04:01.433
How much further?

1:04:01.567 --> 1:04:03.633
It says about 30 miles
until our final destination.

1:04:05.633 --> 1:04:07.000
Oh, uh, pull over here.

1:04:07.133 --> 1:04:08.700
There's a farmer's market
up ahead.

1:04:08.834 --> 1:04:09.934
But you just said
30 more miles.

1:04:10.066 --> 1:04:11.400
Yeah, but half the fun
of a road trip

1:04:11.533 --> 1:04:13.033
is discovering new places.

1:04:14.633 --> 1:04:15.700
Okay.

1:04:15.834 --> 1:04:17.767
I'm not going
whitewater rafting, though.

1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:19.200
Baby steps.

1:04:19.333 --> 1:04:21.000
Yeah.

1:04:21.133 --> 1:04:22.867
- After you.
- Thank you.

1:04:25.834 --> 1:04:26.767
Wow.

1:04:26.900 --> 1:04:29.433
Now, this beats
any grocery store any day,

1:04:29.567 --> 1:04:31.233
with or without a list.

1:04:31.367 --> 1:04:33.400
Wow, I mean,
they've got fresh produce.

1:04:33.533 --> 1:04:35.967
Ooh, locally-sourced
organic juices.

1:04:36.100 --> 1:04:36.934
Those sound good.

1:04:37.066 --> 1:04:39.100
And Goat Yoga.

1:04:39.233 --> 1:04:40.333
What do you think that is?

1:04:40.467 --> 1:04:41.266
I don't know,

1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:43.266
but I think we should try it.

1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:45.033
I don't know, should we?

1:04:45.166 --> 1:04:47.333
Yeah, come on, be spontaneous.

1:04:49.367 --> 1:04:50.500
Uh...

1:04:50.633 --> 1:04:52.000
Hmm?

1:04:53.700 --> 1:04:54.700
Atta girl.

1:05:09.300 --> 1:05:12.333
So, it is a guided yoga session.

1:05:12.467 --> 1:05:14.767
Everyone,
find a comfortable seat.

1:05:14.900 --> 1:05:16.533
Make your way onto all fours.

1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:21.333
And we're going to push up
into Downward-Facing Dog.

1:05:24.100 --> 1:05:25.233
Explore your body.

1:05:25.367 --> 1:05:26.567
Keep your eyes open or closed.

1:05:26.700 --> 1:05:28.500
Then you're going
to take your gaze forward

1:05:28.633 --> 1:05:29.600
and move into a plank.

1:05:30.867 --> 1:05:32.100
Push down,

1:05:32.233 --> 1:05:34.433
and bend back up.

1:05:37.433 --> 1:05:38.500
And press back to Child's Pose.

1:05:38.633 --> 1:05:39.567
How do I--

1:05:39.700 --> 1:05:41.767
I'm gonna get
a picture of this.

1:05:41.900 --> 1:05:43.033
Don't move.

1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:45.934
Then we're going
to go through the cycle

1:05:46.066 --> 1:05:47.333
one more time.

1:05:47.467 --> 1:05:50.600
And drop your shoulders
away from your ears.

1:05:50.734 --> 1:05:52.834
And we're going to repeat.

1:05:54.433 --> 1:05:55.533
It's a circus.

1:05:58.867 --> 1:05:59.900
Okay, I'll see you next week.

1:06:00.100 --> 1:06:00.900
Okay.

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:04.000
Thank you.

1:06:04.133 --> 1:06:06.900
Thank you so much.

1:06:07.033 --> 1:06:07.867
Yeah, you're welcome.

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:09.467
Come again, please.

1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:10.800
Okay.

1:06:10.934 --> 1:06:12.900
Bye, buddy.

1:06:13.033 --> 1:06:15.633
Well, shall we continue
on our adventure?

1:06:15.767 --> 1:06:16.633
We shall.

1:06:16.767 --> 1:06:18.200
30 miles to nowhere...

1:06:18.333 --> 1:06:20.734
30 miles to nowhere.

1:06:28.033 --> 1:06:29.233
Wow.

1:06:29.367 --> 1:06:32.800
There really is
nothing out here.

1:06:32.934 --> 1:06:34.066
Oh, come on,

1:06:34.200 --> 1:06:35.867
there's the sky,

1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:37.633
- and, well, a few birds.
- Okay.

1:06:37.767 --> 1:06:40.667
And, uh, a few trees...

1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:43.166
and now you and me.

1:06:45.734 --> 1:06:47.333
Thank you.

1:06:47.467 --> 1:06:48.967
For what?

1:06:49.100 --> 1:06:51.500
For all of this.

1:06:51.633 --> 1:06:56.200
I really haven't felt
this alive,

1:06:56.333 --> 1:06:57.533
ever,

1:06:57.667 --> 1:06:58.834
than I have
over the last few weeks,

1:06:58.967 --> 1:07:00.233
and to be honest,

1:07:00.367 --> 1:07:04.467
I don't think that I would have
done it on my own, so...

1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:06.033
I guess I was just lucky

1:07:06.166 --> 1:07:08.033
that my first challenge
was to meet somebody new,

1:07:08.166 --> 1:07:09.200
and that that was you.

1:07:11.767 --> 1:07:16.200
Well, maybe that was
your mom's real gift,

1:07:16.333 --> 1:07:18.600
those feelings.

1:07:18.734 --> 1:07:21.200
Those feelings of being alive.

1:07:24.100 --> 1:07:25.233
Yeah.

1:07:27.266 --> 1:07:28.233
You have hay...

1:07:28.367 --> 1:07:29.734
Oh.

1:07:30.934 --> 1:07:32.400
...in your hair.

1:07:32.533 --> 1:07:35.900
That's probably why that goat
was nibbling at me.

1:07:36.033 --> 1:07:38.967
Or that I sprinkled
a little bit of seed around you.

1:07:39.100 --> 1:07:40.667
What, you did?

1:07:44.100 --> 1:07:46.400
Oh, um... sorry.

1:07:48.934 --> 1:07:51.133
Oh, Chloe's texting me.

1:07:51.266 --> 1:07:52.667
She wants me
to come pick her up.

1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:54.967
She's not ready
for a sleepover?

1:07:55.100 --> 1:07:56.200
Guess not.

1:07:56.333 --> 1:07:59.200
Well, at least she tried.

1:07:59.333 --> 1:08:00.533
Well, she'll get there someday.

1:08:00.667 --> 1:08:03.433
Hey, if I can, she will.

1:08:03.567 --> 1:08:04.633
Yeah.

1:08:19.266 --> 1:08:21.266
All right, Mom.

1:08:22.567 --> 1:08:24.166
Last one.

1:08:34.133 --> 1:08:36.233
"Tell someone you love them."

1:08:40.767 --> 1:08:41.667
And there we go,

1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:43.734
home sweet home.

1:08:43.867 --> 1:08:45.800
I'm sorry.

1:08:45.934 --> 1:08:48.166
What are you sorry about?

1:08:48.300 --> 1:08:50.834
I'm sorry that
I was too scared to sleep over,

1:08:50.967 --> 1:08:52.300
and you had to pick me up.

1:08:52.433 --> 1:08:55.467
Oh, come on, don't ever
feel bad about that.

1:08:55.600 --> 1:08:57.266
You know,
we all get scared, right?

1:08:57.400 --> 1:09:01.000
And remember,
even when you're all grown up,

1:09:01.133 --> 1:09:02.066
if you call me,

1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:03.066
and you want me
to come bring you home,

1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:04.033
I will.

1:09:04.166 --> 1:09:05.867
Okay?

1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:08.367
I'm happy we moved here,

1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:10.000
and I'm happy you met Taylor,

1:09:10.133 --> 1:09:12.800
and that you're happy, too.

1:09:12.934 --> 1:09:14.900
I'm happy we moved here, too.

1:09:15.033 --> 1:09:16.033
Okay.

1:09:16.166 --> 1:09:18.033
Do you want me
to turn the light out?

1:09:18.166 --> 1:09:19.967
No, I think I'm gonna read
for a bit.

1:09:20.100 --> 1:09:21.467
Okay.

1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:22.367
Good night.

1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:23.667
'Night.

1:09:25.467 --> 1:09:26.233
I love you.

1:09:26.367 --> 1:09:28.100
Love you.

1:10:06.166 --> 1:10:08.033
All right.

1:10:08.166 --> 1:10:11.500
We have the winter sports
set up here,

1:10:11.633 --> 1:10:13.066
with the helmets and the skis.

1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:15.967
We just need a place
for the summer sports.

1:10:16.100 --> 1:10:16.967
Taylor?

1:10:17.100 --> 1:10:18.000
Hmm.

1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:20.867
Yeah, that looks great.

1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:22.400
Are you okay?

1:10:22.533 --> 1:10:23.467
Yeah.

1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:24.633
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

1:10:24.767 --> 1:10:26.400
Uh...

1:10:26.533 --> 1:10:28.333
and I really like your ideas.

1:10:29.333 --> 1:10:30.633
Thanks.

1:10:32.033 --> 1:10:33.333
In fact...

1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:36.834
I love you.

1:10:36.967 --> 1:10:38.633
Well, I love you, too--

1:10:38.767 --> 1:10:39.533
No, no,

1:10:39.667 --> 1:10:42.133
I...

1:10:42.266 --> 1:10:43.667
love you.

1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:46.834
Oh,

1:10:46.967 --> 1:10:48.700
Taylor,

1:10:48.834 --> 1:10:50.633
I think you are
a beautiful woman,

1:10:50.767 --> 1:10:52.233
and an amazing boss,

1:10:52.367 --> 1:10:53.533
but the love thing with me,

1:10:53.667 --> 1:10:55.233
I don't think it'll work out.

1:10:55.367 --> 1:10:58.667
Like, I get very nervous
with this thing.

1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:00.633
Like, I'm sweating right now,
profusely.

1:11:00.767 --> 1:11:02.066
Is it hot in here?

1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:03.100
And especially
when we work together.

1:11:03.233 --> 1:11:04.100
It's not gonna work.

1:11:04.233 --> 1:11:05.734
No...

1:11:05.867 --> 1:11:07.200
I don't love you
like that "love you".

1:11:07.333 --> 1:11:08.233
I...

1:11:08.367 --> 1:11:09.400
just... it...

1:11:09.533 --> 1:11:12.633
It's this challenge
my mom has me doing.

1:11:12.767 --> 1:11:13.633
It's crazy.

1:11:13.767 --> 1:11:15.633
Sorry, challenge?

1:11:15.767 --> 1:11:17.800
Yes, my mom has me doing
these challenges,

1:11:17.934 --> 1:11:19.066
and by the last one,

1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:21.300
my birthday present
is supposed to reveal itself,

1:11:21.433 --> 1:11:22.633
and this last one

1:11:22.767 --> 1:11:24.066
is that I'm supposed to tell
somebody I love them,

1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:24.900
so...

1:11:25.033 --> 1:11:26.367
So you copped out.

1:11:26.500 --> 1:11:27.467
I... did.

1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:28.567
I did, yes.

1:11:28.700 --> 1:11:30.433
But I do really like you--

1:11:30.567 --> 1:11:31.467
It's okay.

1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:32.433
I get it, trust me.

1:11:32.567 --> 1:11:34.934
I have a lot on my plate, okay?

1:11:35.066 --> 1:11:36.533
I've got Christie, Veronica,

1:11:36.667 --> 1:11:37.533
and that Jade,

1:11:37.667 --> 1:11:39.633
she's been sending me
some wild emojis

1:11:39.767 --> 1:11:41.567
I do not know what to do with.

1:11:41.700 --> 1:11:42.867
Are you worried

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:44.600
because you haven't
fallen in love

1:11:44.734 --> 1:11:45.734
or because you have?

1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:51.066
Oh... my... gosh.

1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:52.533
You have.

1:11:52.667 --> 1:11:54.600
It's with that neighbor, right?

1:11:54.734 --> 1:11:57.066
Um... Pleasantville.

1:11:58.333 --> 1:11:59.266
That look says it all.

1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:01.467
This just put a fun spin
on the day.

1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:02.533
Oh, it's not fun,

1:12:02.667 --> 1:12:04.033
it's terrifying.

1:12:04.166 --> 1:12:05.500
I mean,
what am I supposed to do?

1:12:05.633 --> 1:12:07.166
I just, like, go over there,

1:12:07.300 --> 1:12:10.934
and be like, "What's up?
I'm, like, in love with you."

1:12:11.066 --> 1:12:12.133
No.

1:12:12.266 --> 1:12:13.700
It's-- He's gonna think
I'm a crazy woman.

1:12:13.834 --> 1:12:14.767
That's true.

1:12:14.900 --> 1:12:15.834
I thought you were crazy
two minutes ago.

1:12:15.967 --> 1:12:16.767
Exactly,

1:12:16.900 --> 1:12:18.700
because it's scary.

1:12:18.834 --> 1:12:20.700
It's way scarier
than just going on dates,

1:12:20.834 --> 1:12:23.133
which you won't even do,

1:12:23.266 --> 1:12:24.133
and you know what,

1:12:24.266 --> 1:12:25.967
I completed
most of those challenges,

1:12:26.100 --> 1:12:28.633
so I'm gonna say
that five out of six ain't bad.

1:12:28.767 --> 1:12:31.000
Okay, how about this,

1:12:31.133 --> 1:12:32.000
I'll go on a date

1:12:32.133 --> 1:12:34.600
if you tell Josh
how you feel.

1:12:34.734 --> 1:12:36.300
That hardly seems fair.

1:12:36.433 --> 1:12:38.834
Even if it's with Jade
and those crazy emojis?

1:12:38.967 --> 1:12:40.133
No.

1:12:40.266 --> 1:12:41.266
Fine.

1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:42.834
I'll stop texting,

1:12:42.967 --> 1:12:44.133
and I'll just go on dates.

1:12:44.266 --> 1:12:45.700
Like, I'll see people
face to face,

1:12:45.834 --> 1:12:47.467
in the real world.

1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:48.600
Because you're right.

1:12:48.734 --> 1:12:51.266
I tend to hide behind my phone,

1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:54.867
and just not, like,
seeing people face to face.

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:56.033
I get nervous and sweaty--

1:12:56.166 --> 1:12:57.367
You saw what just happened
to me right there.

1:12:59.333 --> 1:13:00.934
So what do you say?

1:13:01.066 --> 1:13:02.467
We take this plunge together?

1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:08.734
Knock knock!

1:13:08.867 --> 1:13:10.600
Hey.

1:13:10.734 --> 1:13:12.200
I didn't know
you were popping by.

1:13:12.333 --> 1:13:13.900
I was actually
on my way home from work,

1:13:14.033 --> 1:13:16.333
but I thought
I would stop by with these.

1:13:16.467 --> 1:13:17.266
I haven't gotten you

1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:18.834
an official housewarming gift,

1:13:18.967 --> 1:13:20.734
so... here you are.

1:13:20.867 --> 1:13:22.734
You trust me
to take care of some plants?

1:13:22.867 --> 1:13:24.333
No, don't be silly,

1:13:24.467 --> 1:13:27.000
I'll make sure
Chloe gets them watered.

1:13:27.133 --> 1:13:28.033
Is she home?

1:13:28.166 --> 1:13:29.166
Yeah, she just
got home from school.

1:13:29.300 --> 1:13:30.233
Great.

1:13:30.367 --> 1:13:31.500
I'll get her to help me

1:13:31.633 --> 1:13:32.867
find a sunny spot
for these ones.

1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:34.033
Great.

1:13:34.166 --> 1:13:35.700
I should, uh, get
some water in these, right?

1:13:35.834 --> 1:13:36.700
Probably.

1:13:36.834 --> 1:13:38.100
Okay.

1:13:38.233 --> 1:13:39.667
Oh, geez.

1:13:41.900 --> 1:13:44.066
"I love you."

1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:45.166
No.

1:13:45.300 --> 1:13:46.600
Uh...

1:13:52.834 --> 1:13:54.066
I love you.

1:13:55.033 --> 1:13:55.834
Hmm. Ha, ha, ha!

1:13:55.967 --> 1:13:57.734
Okay.

1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:00.433
I... I love you!

1:14:00.567 --> 1:14:01.266
I'm ready.

1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:02.300
I've got this.

1:14:02.433 --> 1:14:03.400
I can-- I've got this
I've got this.

1:14:03.533 --> 1:14:04.233
I could do them all.

1:14:04.367 --> 1:14:05.066
I did them all.

1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:07.300
I love you.

1:14:07.433 --> 1:14:08.934
I'm just gonna do it.

1:14:10.066 --> 1:14:12.834
Chloe, I found a spot
for the last one!

1:14:29.133 --> 1:14:30.166
Josh,

1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:31.667
was...

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:33.633
was this the surprise?

1:14:33.767 --> 1:14:34.900
Um--

1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:40.233
Hold on.

1:14:40.367 --> 1:14:41.367
Let me just get that.

1:14:47.133 --> 1:14:48.800
Taylor, uh...

1:14:48.934 --> 1:14:49.934
what is it?

1:14:50.066 --> 1:14:51.834
It's my last challenge,

1:14:51.967 --> 1:14:54.400
and it's a crazy one.

1:14:54.533 --> 1:14:56.300
Um...

1:14:56.433 --> 1:14:59.333
I have to tell somebody
that I, um...

1:15:02.633 --> 1:15:04.567
Okay, I have to tell somebody
that...

1:15:04.700 --> 1:15:07.033
Um, oh, uh, maybe--

1:15:07.166 --> 1:15:09.700
I have to tell somebody
that I...

1:15:09.834 --> 1:15:11.166
Um, maybe it's...

1:15:18.433 --> 1:15:20.200
Taylor, are you okay?

1:15:21.667 --> 1:15:23.000
Um... Ooh...

1:15:23.133 --> 1:15:24.000
No, I think I...

1:15:24.133 --> 1:15:25.734
I need a paper bag.

1:15:25.867 --> 1:15:27.133
Okay, I'll get you one,
just take a seat.

1:15:27.266 --> 1:15:28.734
Why don't you sit down?

1:15:28.867 --> 1:15:31.033
Uh, paper bag, paper bag,
paper bag, paper bag...

1:15:31.166 --> 1:15:32.033
Whew!

1:15:32.166 --> 1:15:34.033
Paper bag, paper bag...

1:15:34.166 --> 1:15:35.233
Ah! Paper bag!

1:15:35.367 --> 1:15:36.166
I'm coming, sorry.

1:15:36.300 --> 1:15:38.300
Here, here...

1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.066
Nice and slow.

1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:49.700
Is that better?

1:15:49.834 --> 1:15:51.200
Yeah, much, thank you.

1:15:51.333 --> 1:15:53.700
What happened?

1:15:53.834 --> 1:15:54.567
Um...

1:15:54.700 --> 1:15:57.800
I don't know, I, um...

1:15:57.934 --> 1:15:59.734
I think I saw a spider.

1:15:59.867 --> 1:16:01.934
Wait, so this is not
your challenge?

1:16:02.066 --> 1:16:02.934
What?

1:16:03.066 --> 1:16:05.200
The ch-- No, no, no.

1:16:05.333 --> 1:16:07.166
No, that's easy peasy.

1:16:08.200 --> 1:16:09.800
I thought you said
it was crazy.

1:16:09.934 --> 1:16:11.200
Yeah. Crazy easy.

1:16:12.834 --> 1:16:16.233
I just have to tell somebody
that, um...

1:16:19.900 --> 1:16:21.700
something nice.

1:16:23.266 --> 1:16:24.066
Yeah, so I just,

1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:26.233
I came over here
to tell you guys

1:16:26.367 --> 1:16:30.166
that you're such great,
great neighbors.

1:16:31.734 --> 1:16:33.934
Thank you.

1:16:34.066 --> 1:16:35.066
That's it.

1:16:37.900 --> 1:16:38.700
So...

1:16:38.834 --> 1:16:40.100
recycle this.

1:16:40.233 --> 1:16:41.033
Yeah.

1:16:41.166 --> 1:16:42.433
I'm just gonna leave you guys

1:16:42.567 --> 1:16:45.333
to do whatever it was
you were doing.

1:16:46.367 --> 1:16:47.300
Are you sure you're okay?

1:16:47.433 --> 1:16:49.500
100%.

1:17:12.934 --> 1:17:15.500
I'm sorry, Sara.

1:17:15.633 --> 1:17:16.934
I just forgot,
with everything going on--

1:17:17.066 --> 1:17:18.000
It's okay.

1:17:18.133 --> 1:17:20.500
Clearly, you have things
on your mind.

1:17:20.633 --> 1:17:23.633
I just honestly
thought that...

1:17:24.767 --> 1:17:27.834
you've been
so great with Chloe,

1:17:27.967 --> 1:17:30.266
and Claire wanted her to have
a mother figure,

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:32.000
so I thought that

1:17:32.133 --> 1:17:34.934
maybe someday
we could be a family,

1:17:35.066 --> 1:17:35.900
but now I--

1:17:36.033 --> 1:17:37.800
I understand,

1:17:37.934 --> 1:17:40.500
and you deserve to have
someone in your life again,

1:17:40.633 --> 1:17:42.967
but not just for Chloe.

1:17:44.233 --> 1:17:46.800
You've never been afraid
to just jump right in,

1:17:46.934 --> 1:17:49.066
like this.

1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:52.233
It's what Claire loved
about you.

1:17:52.367 --> 1:17:55.433
I think it's what Taylor
might love about you, too.

1:17:57.934 --> 1:18:01.166
You've been
a really amazing friend.

1:18:01.300 --> 1:18:03.066
And that's what I'll stay.

1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:06.033
You'll always make
the right decision for Chloe,

1:18:06.166 --> 1:18:08.567
and at the end of the day,
I love you,

1:18:08.700 --> 1:18:11.166
and I want you to be happy,

1:18:11.300 --> 1:18:12.367
and it seems like

1:18:12.500 --> 1:18:15.433
Taylor might be the one
to do that for you.

1:18:20.333 --> 1:18:22.200
Dad.

1:18:22.333 --> 1:18:24.200
I really, really tried,
but I can't do it, okay?

1:18:24.333 --> 1:18:25.567
He's...

1:18:25.700 --> 1:18:27.734
He's proposing
to somebody else.

1:18:29.900 --> 1:18:31.266
I know it's a...

1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:33.600
it's a risk,

1:18:33.734 --> 1:18:37.800
but if your mom did it,

1:18:37.934 --> 1:18:40.400
then you can, too.

1:18:40.533 --> 1:18:42.300
What do you mean, mom did it?

1:19:11.133 --> 1:19:13.500
Did you guys
do the challenge, too?

1:19:13.633 --> 1:19:15.467
Well, she did.

1:19:15.600 --> 1:19:19.066
That's... how she met me.

1:19:20.633 --> 1:19:22.533
Why?

1:19:22.667 --> 1:19:26.333
She didn't have to overcome
any anxieties.

1:19:28.066 --> 1:19:31.100
You're a lot more like her
than you know.

1:19:31.233 --> 1:19:32.800
That's why her mother,

1:19:32.934 --> 1:19:34.300
on her birthday,

1:19:34.433 --> 1:19:36.500
gifted her with a time capsule,

1:19:36.633 --> 1:19:37.734
just like the one you got,

1:19:37.867 --> 1:19:40.200
with the same six challenges,

1:19:40.333 --> 1:19:43.066
and, yes, she was
afraid of spiders, too...

1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:49.266
...and these challenges
led her to me,

1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:51.133
and a life

1:19:51.266 --> 1:19:54.133
that neither she or I could
ever have dreamed possible...

1:19:55.367 --> 1:19:57.500
Because before I met her,

1:19:57.633 --> 1:19:59.467
I was on a different path,

1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:02.467
one that I thought was right,

1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:06.700
and until she said
"I love you,"

1:20:06.834 --> 1:20:09.633
I... didn't realize

1:20:09.767 --> 1:20:12.467
I was capable of being loved.

1:20:14.066 --> 1:20:17.133
Oh, Dad.

1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:22.467
Honey...

1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:26.500
I know that telling someone
"I love you"

1:20:26.633 --> 1:20:28.367
is one of the hardest things
anyone can do...

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:32.000
because it leaves us open,

1:20:32.133 --> 1:20:34.033
our hearts,

1:20:34.166 --> 1:20:36.266
but if we don't,

1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:40.133
we may miss out
on the very best part of life.

1:20:43.500 --> 1:20:44.967
Yeah.

1:21:14.533 --> 1:21:15.433
It's no big deal...

1:21:15.567 --> 1:21:18.133
It's just words,
just a few words.

1:21:22.133 --> 1:21:23.100
Hi.

1:21:24.934 --> 1:21:25.900
Taylor.

1:21:27.100 --> 1:21:27.967
What are you doing here?

1:21:28.100 --> 1:21:30.333
Um, I just need
to tell you something.

1:21:30.467 --> 1:21:33.600
It's actually what I was
gonna tell you the other day,

1:21:33.734 --> 1:21:35.867
and then I saw Sara
with the ring, and it just--

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:36.934
Taylor, wait, I--

1:21:37.066 --> 1:21:38.700
Josh, I just need
to get through this,

1:21:38.834 --> 1:21:41.066
so please just let me, okay?

1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:42.500
It's my last challenge,

1:21:42.633 --> 1:21:44.700
and if I don't get through it,

1:21:44.834 --> 1:21:46.333
then I'm just...

1:21:46.467 --> 1:21:47.800
I just have to
get through it, okay?

1:21:49.900 --> 1:21:51.500
Here.

1:21:54.300 --> 1:21:55.467
That's it.

1:21:56.533 --> 1:21:57.533
I obviously haven't been able

1:21:57.667 --> 1:21:59.000
to get through any of the others
without you,

1:21:59.133 --> 1:22:01.367
so why would this be
any different?

1:22:02.533 --> 1:22:03.433
So here goes...

1:22:03.567 --> 1:22:04.333
Look, Taylor--

1:22:04.467 --> 1:22:06.100
I'm in love with you.

1:22:07.834 --> 1:22:09.266
I'm in love with you.

1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:11.300
You were my first challenge,

1:22:11.433 --> 1:22:12.667
and now you're my last,

1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:13.834
and I don't expect
anything in return,

1:22:13.967 --> 1:22:17.000
I just... needed to say that.

1:22:17.133 --> 1:22:18.333
So I did.

1:22:26.266 --> 1:22:28.333
Were they here the whole time?

1:22:28.467 --> 1:22:29.533
Taylor,
I was trying to tell you,

1:22:29.667 --> 1:22:31.200
we're about to start practice.

1:22:37.133 --> 1:22:38.033
Taylor, wait.

1:22:38.166 --> 1:22:39.133
Uh, I can't--

1:22:39.266 --> 1:22:41.233
Taylor, I'm in love
with you, too!

1:22:44.734 --> 1:22:45.600
What?

1:22:45.734 --> 1:22:48.000
I love you.

1:22:48.133 --> 1:22:50.000
Which is crazy,

1:22:50.133 --> 1:22:51.200
because I was on this path,

1:22:51.333 --> 1:22:52.734
and then you came along,

1:22:52.867 --> 1:22:56.133
and now I'm on
this other path...

1:22:56.266 --> 1:22:58.133
Like whitewater rafting?

1:22:58.266 --> 1:23:00.166
Yeah.

1:23:00.300 --> 1:23:02.300
Like a slam dunk

1:23:02.433 --> 1:23:05.834
with one second left
on the board.

1:23:05.967 --> 1:23:07.867
But then what about the ring,

1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.767
and the surprise, and...

1:23:12.700 --> 1:23:14.433
You were the surprise.

1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:19.333
Um...

1:23:20.700 --> 1:23:22.934
So where do we go from here?

1:23:33.867 --> 1:23:35.200
How's that for spontaneous?

1:23:35.333 --> 1:23:36.667
That was pretty good.

1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:37.734
Really good.

1:23:37.867 --> 1:23:41.300
I mean, we could probably,
you know...

1:23:48.200 --> 1:23:50.967
Today is a new day...

1:23:52.967 --> 1:23:55.867
Any worries I may have
shall pass,

1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.800
as they did yesterday,

1:23:58.934 --> 1:24:00.100
and the day before that,

1:24:00.233 --> 1:24:02.233
and every day...

1:24:04.700 --> 1:24:06.433
Hi, guys!

1:24:06.567 --> 1:24:07.433
Hey. You ready?

1:24:07.567 --> 1:24:08.600
Yup.

1:24:08.734 --> 1:24:10.367
I made us
some ham and brie sandwiches,

1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:11.567
some salami,

1:24:11.700 --> 1:24:14.734
and I tried
a new egg salad recipe.

1:24:14.867 --> 1:24:16.967
Oh, we love egg salad.

1:24:17.100 --> 1:24:18.133
So shall we do this?

1:24:18.266 --> 1:24:20.633
Do you want
to close your eyes?

1:24:23.433 --> 1:24:25.400
Where are we going?

1:24:25.533 --> 1:24:27.100
Looks like
the middle of nowhere.

1:24:27.233 --> 1:24:28.734
That's perfect.

1:24:30.166 --> 1:24:31.500
Want to navigate?

1:24:31.633 --> 1:24:32.800
Oh...

1:24:32.934 --> 1:24:34.367
you're the boss now.

1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:39.600
If I begin to lose focus,

1:24:39.734 --> 1:24:41.633
I'll acknowledge
what's worrying me.

1:24:41.767 --> 1:24:44.767
If I can resolve it, I will,

1:24:44.900 --> 1:24:46.133
and if I can't,

1:24:46.266 --> 1:24:47.567
I'll let it go,

1:24:47.700 --> 1:24:52.867
roll up my worries and anxieties
into a tiny ball...

1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.367
and just throw them away.
