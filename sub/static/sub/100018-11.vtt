27:34.525 --> 27:37.375
lonely place to be.

27:39.931 --> 27:43.500
But this was a...

27:43.534 --> 27:44.902
This is...

27:44.902 --> 27:48.739
a family of choice.

27:48.771 --> 27:51.406
Breaking apart was a choice.

27:51.442 --> 27:53.242
In the light of this news,

27:53.242 --> 27:56.380
I'm asking you
to make another one.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.781
To come together.

27:58.816 --> 28:02.053
Walking away
from bad feelings is easy.

28:02.086 --> 28:04.521
It's much harder
to take the blow,

28:04.521 --> 28:08.659
and come back for more,
but that's what a family does.

28:08.692 --> 28:10.795
If you can unite,

28:10.826 --> 28:13.498
you can face any threat.

28:13.498 --> 28:18.067
But if darkness arrives
while you're still cast apart,

28:18.067 --> 28:23.067
I truly believe
that none of you will survive.

28:29.578 --> 28:32.615
If you won't protect
one another,

28:32.650 --> 28:34.000
who will?

Yup.

[Kory]
So, let me get this straight.

29:00.743 --> 29:02.278
Bruce Wayne somehow

29:02.278 --> 29:05.250
miraculously arranged for us
all to meet in this diner

29:05.281 --> 29:07.852
in the middle of nowhere
to mansplain us

29:07.884 --> 29:10.688
into putting the Titans
back together?

29:10.721 --> 29:12.154
Yup.

29:12.190 --> 29:15.858
I think that's exactly
what just happened.

Troy, where are you going?

29:49.160 --> 29:50.492
Back to San Francisco.

29:50.527 --> 29:53.028
No. We need to save Dick.

29:53.064 --> 29:54.765
Dick's on his own.

29:54.798 --> 29:56.097
What is wrong with you?

29:56.133 --> 29:57.268
Me?

29:57.300 --> 29:59.269
Look, I know Dick Grayson,
okay?

29:59.304 --> 30:01.538
He put himself up
on that cross.

30:01.570 --> 30:03.973
Nailed himself to it.

30:03.973 --> 30:06.608
Now he's going to have
to take himself down, too.

30:06.644 --> 30:08.144
[Dawn] Donna's right.

30:08.179 --> 30:13.179
Whatever Dick's doing,
he's doing to himself.

30:16.086 --> 30:20.856
I'm having dreams again.

30:20.892 --> 30:23.826
I was at Dick's funeral.

30:23.861 --> 30:26.931
Deathstroke killed him.

30:26.962 --> 30:29.567
[softly] Look...

30:29.598 --> 30:31.567
I know...

30:31.567 --> 30:34.371
that I sound crazy.

30:34.403 --> 30:36.972
I know that.

30:36.972 --> 30:40.423
But Dick needs my help.

30:42.423 --> 30:46.180
And I really need yours.

30:47.683 --> 30:48.733
Please.

31:14.376 --> 31:16.747
I do.

31:16.747 --> 31:20.151
But I'm going to go with Donna.

31:20.182 --> 31:25.182
As soon as you're done here,
you come find us, okay?

31:46.076 --> 31:50.614

you're leaving, too.

31:50.646 --> 31:52.750
Hell, no.

33:10.993 --> 33:12.429
Your old high school?

33:12.429 --> 33:13.498
Great.

33:13.529 --> 33:16.598
What's next? You're going
to ask me to prom?

33:16.634 --> 33:19.336
Not my school.

33:19.367 --> 33:20.567
My home.

33:24.476 --> 33:27.211
Dad was an asshole
who got himself killed,

33:27.243 --> 33:29.380
Mom was an addict.

33:29.413 --> 33:31.516
I did the whole
delinquency tour.

Foster care, juvie,
lived on the streets.

33:35.153 --> 33:38.622
[chuckles softly]

33:38.622 --> 33:41.791
Then I found this place.

33:41.826 --> 33:45.328
Crammed a sleeping bag
in the rafters over there.

33:45.363 --> 33:46.564
Hid out up here at night,

33:46.596 --> 33:50.335
watched the theater kids
living their best lives.

33:50.366 --> 33:54.005
Explains why
you're so dramatic.

33:54.038 --> 33:56.140
And I used to think
they were losers,

33:56.173 --> 34:00.612
but look who ended up
in a mask and a cape.

34:00.644 --> 34:02.846
You're not as shallow
as you seem.

34:02.881 --> 34:06.217
Compliments really aren't
your strong suit, huh?

34:06.217 --> 34:08.753
I mean, I assumed
you were some rich asshole.

34:08.786 --> 34:11.422
Born on third,
thinking he hit a triple.

34:11.456 --> 34:13.391
But don't get me wrong,
it's still totally lame

34:13.391 --> 34:15.626
that your big secret is
that you're a theater nerd.

34:15.626 --> 34:16.661
Thespians.

34:16.695 --> 34:21.695
Okay, thespians,
not theater nerds. [chuckles]

34:22.766 --> 34:25.869
So, are there any more
plot twists or can we go?

34:25.902 --> 34:27.338
Hey.

34:27.371 --> 34:28.806
What's your problem?

34:28.806 --> 34:30.172
My problem?

34:30.208 --> 34:32.210
Look, I bring you here,
I tell you all this,

34:32.210 --> 34:33.677
and you treat me like shit.

34:33.710 --> 34:36.614
I was just fucking with you,
damn.

34:36.614 --> 34:38.349
Every time I try to
get close to you, Rose,

34:38.349 --> 34:40.351
you push me away.

34:40.385 --> 34:45.322
You want to leave,
then go. Fine, go!

34:45.356 --> 34:46.858
Why are you being
such an asshole?

34:46.891 --> 34:51.661
Because I see you searching
for an excuse to run.

34:51.661 --> 34:52.731
I'm not.

34:52.764 --> 34:56.067
I've spent my whole life
pushing people away, Rose.

34:56.099 --> 34:59.702
Doing stupid shit.
Breaking things.

34:59.737 --> 35:01.338
Hey.

35:01.371 --> 35:04.175
I've never done this
before either.

35:04.175 --> 35:09.175
But every second
I spend with you
is like a new lease on life.

35:11.148 --> 35:13.751
Jason, I told you,

35:13.751 --> 35:15.385
I'm bad news.

35:15.420 --> 35:17.221
I... I can't...

35:17.255 --> 35:19.590
Hey...

35:19.590 --> 35:23.094
it's okay.

35:23.126 --> 35:26.931
There's a place for us.

35:26.963 --> 35:30.713
Somewhere a place for us.

35:33.304 --> 35:37.675
Hold my hand
and we're halfway there.

35:37.708 --> 35:42.708
Hold my hand
and I'll take you there.

35:47.617 --> 35:50.253
Somehow.

35:50.288 --> 35:53.291
[both] Someday.

35:53.324 --> 35:57.994
Somewhere.

35:58.027 --> 35:59.597
What?

35:59.630 --> 36:04.630
You thought
you were the only nerd?

36:19.449 --> 36:23.987
It works, doesn't it?

36:24.021 --> 36:26.023
Where'd you go?

36:26.056 --> 36:27.724
You needed to rest.

36:27.759 --> 36:30.427
Build up your strength
for the escape.

36:30.460 --> 36:32.563
No escapes for me.

36:32.597 --> 36:35.900
Deathstroke
has taken hostages

36:35.931 --> 36:37.001
and here you are.

36:37.034 --> 36:38.202
We have a truce.

36:38.235 --> 36:41.438
He's not touching anybody.

36:41.472 --> 36:46.177
No one you can see.

36:46.210 --> 36:48.179
At Adeline's,

36:48.179 --> 36:49.947
Slade was there,

36:49.980 --> 36:52.016
you were there,

36:52.047 --> 36:54.184
and yet no killing.

36:54.217 --> 36:58.054
Why?

36:58.088 --> 37:00.090
He was unarmed.

37:00.123 --> 37:02.460
And?

37:02.492 --> 37:04.596
And I was
in Adeline's house.

37:04.628 --> 37:07.664
Maybe you didn't want to.

37:07.699 --> 37:12.670
Maybe there's something inside
Slade that you need.

37:12.704 --> 37:17.608
Yeah, his tiny tin heart
got to me.

37:17.641 --> 37:20.378
You both loved Jericho,

37:20.411 --> 37:24.114
and you both got him killed.

37:24.148 --> 37:29.018
A common bond
of self-loathing.

37:29.052 --> 37:30.221
As long as you're both alive,

37:30.221 --> 37:32.356
you can always blame
the other guy.

37:32.389 --> 37:34.224
I admitted to my mistake.

37:34.257 --> 37:38.458
[scoffs] It was very moving.

37:40.130 --> 37:41.264
You think this is funny?

37:41.264 --> 37:43.000
