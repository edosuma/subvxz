Mutant X - 3x05

00:12.033 --> 00:13.467
CONSIDER THIS A SAMPLE.

00:13.567 --> 00:15.367
THIS STUFF HASN'T
EVEN HIT THE STREET YET.

00:15.467 --> 00:17.234
IS IT AS GOOD THEY SAY?

00:17.334 --> 00:18.868
IT'S BETTER. TRUST ME.

00:18.968 --> 00:20.400
THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT
CAME FROM - A LOT MORE.

00:20.501 --> 00:23.067
WE'LL TALK.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.167
HEY,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

00:37.300 --> 00:39.300
THIS IS MY GUEST.
- YEAH.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.534
CIAO, BELLA.

00:40.634 --> 00:41.634
CIAO, MILO.

00:41.734 --> 00:43.200
WHERE HAVE
YOU BEEN HIDING?

00:43.300 --> 00:45.133
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
COULD USE ANOTHER ONE.

00:45.234 --> 00:47.901
YEAH. THANKS.

00:51.868 --> 00:54.601
I REMEMBER THE NIGHTS WHEN
YOU USED TO CLOSE THIS PLACE.

00:54.701 --> 00:59.100
AH, YEAH
- THAT'S BEFORE YOU STARTED
WATERING DOWN THE DRINKS.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.067
HEY.

01:00.167 --> 01:01.868
CROWD LOOKS
PRETTY HOT TONIGHT.

01:01.968 --> 01:03.434
ALWAYS.

01:04.566 --> 01:06.167
SO, WHAT DO YOU DO?

01:06.267 --> 01:10.467
I TEND TO PHASE FROM
ONE THING TO THE NEXT.

WHAT CAN I DO
TO PUT YOU IN THE MOOD?

01:29.100 --> 01:31.033
ACTUALLY, I'M
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.267
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM AROUND.

01:33.367 --> 01:34.767
BOYFRIEND?

01:34.868 --> 01:37.901
NO, HE'S MY BROTHER.
HIS NAME IS LUKE.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.567
THIS LOOK FAMILIAR?

01:40.667 --> 01:42.567
SI, SI.
I HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.467
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, THOUGH
- A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, MAYBE.

01:44.567 --> 01:47.400
HE WAS IN EVERY NIGHT FOR
A WEEK AND THEN NEVER CAME BACK.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.300
WELL, HOW...
WELL, HOW WAS HE?

01:50.400 --> 01:51.868
HOW DID HE LOOK?

01:51.968 --> 01:54.067
HE LOOKED LIKE HE KNEW
HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

01:54.167 --> 01:56.767
WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU STILL
KNOW HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME?

01:56.868 --> 02:00.133
NOT LIKE I USED TO.

02:05.801 --> 02:06.868
HERE'S TO GOOD TIMES.

02:06.968 --> 02:09.032
TO GOOD TIMES.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.834
OH, MY GOD.

02:16.934 --> 02:22.367
UGH... UGH...

<SCREAMING>

02:32.234 --> 02:34.701
<GRUNTING>

02:36.567 --> 02:38.234
WHAT DID YOU GIVE HER?

02:40.267 --> 02:41.467
WHAT?!

02:41.567 --> 02:42.467
NOTHING.

02:42.567 --> 02:44.000
AGH...!

04:12.300 --> 04:13.467
GAVE ME THIS ADDRESS.

04:13.567 --> 04:15.033
WANT ME TO ASK FOR DR. MARCUS.

04:15.133 --> 04:18.399
I'M DR. MARCUS.
TAKE HER RIGHT INTO
THE EXAMINATION ROOM.

04:32.701 --> 04:34.000
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

04:34.100 --> 04:36.400
THIS IS MY LAB.
SAFE FROM PRYING EYES.

04:36.501 --> 04:39.334
PLEASE BRING HER IN.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.701
THIS IS AN ADVANCED
GENETICS LAB.

05:02.801 --> 05:05.434
WE'VE GOT ONE
OF THESE IN... SANCTUARY.

05:05.534 --> 05:07.434
YES, I KNOW.

05:07.534 --> 05:09.067
HOW?

05:09.167 --> 05:12.667
ADAM KANE GAVE ME
THE MONEY FOR THIS LAB.

05:12.767 --> 05:16.834
I THINK BECAUSE I ACTED AS
HIS CONSCIENCE ALL THESE YEARS.

05:22.234 --> 05:25.133
WELL,
YOU MUST BE GOOD.

05:25.234 --> 05:27.801
YES - OF GOOD MIND.

05:27.901 --> 05:29.901
<i>JESS, WHAT'S GOING ON?</i>

05:30.000 --> 05:31.901
<i>HOW'S SHE DOING?</i>

05:32.000 --> 05:33.734
THE DOCTOR'S
CHECKING HER OUT, SHAL.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.801
<i>WHAT HAPPENED?</i>

05:36.901 --> 05:40.267
UM, I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHERE
SHE WAS SNEAKING OUT TO AT

05:40.367 --> 05:43.334
NIGHT, SO I FOLLOWED
HER DOWN TO A CLUB - CECILUCA.

05:43.434 --> 05:46.234
THE GUY SHE MET UP WITH PUT
SOMETHING IN HER DRINK AND ALL

05:46.334 --> 05:50.501
OF A SUDDEN SHE
JUST... SHE WENT POSTAL.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.567
WAS ANYBODY ELSE HURT?

05:52.667 --> 05:55.901
NO. LET'S JUST SAY IT'S
A GOOD THING I WAS THERE.

05:58.701 --> 06:00.634
RIGHT NOW, SHE'S STABLE.

06:00.734 --> 06:02.167
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

06:02.267 --> 06:03.701
YEAH, THANK GOD.

06:03.801 --> 06:07.434
BUT I WON'T KNOW MORE
UNTIL I IDENTIFY THE SUBSTANCE
SHE INGESTED.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.400
WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME I
NARROWED THAT DOWN FOR YOU, HUH?

06:10.501 --> 06:12.234
HEY, JESSE, WHY
DON'T YOU STAY WITH HER?

06:12.334 --> 06:13.767
BRENNAN'S GOT IT COVERED.

06:13.868 --> 06:14.934
NO WAY.

06:15.033 --> 06:17.534
DOC, KEEP AN EYE
ON HER. I'LL BE BACK.

06:22.567 --> 06:25.434
ESCA QUI E
SCOPI SU QUESTO VETRO.

06:25.534 --> 06:28.133
DIMITRI?

06:28.234 --> 06:29.934
DIMITRI TOOK THE REST
OF THE NIGHT OFF.

06:30.033 --> 06:31.434
WHO ARE YOU?

06:31.534 --> 06:33.033
A FRIEND OF A FRIEND.

06:33.133 --> 06:35.801
HEY! REMEMBER ME?

06:35.901 --> 06:38.534
SO HOW IS SHE?

06:38.634 --> 06:41.434
YOUR CONCERN IS
HITTING ME RIGHT HERE.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.767
WELL,
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

06:42.868 --> 06:44.334
LOOK WHAT
SHE DID TO MY PLACE.

06:44.434 --> 06:46.400
OH,
TRUST ME - YOU'RE GOING TO
LOOK A LOT WORSE THAN THIS

06:46.501 --> 06:48.400
UNLESS YOU TELL US WHAT
YOU SLIPPED IN HER DRINK.

06:48.501 --> 06:50.667
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.033
NON STIA A ME!
<DON'T LIE TO ME! >

06:52.133 --> 06:54.267
C'E L'HAI TRE SECONDI
PER DIRMI CHE COS'ERA.

06:54.367 --> 06:56.467
<YOU HAVE THREE SECONDS
TO TELL ME WHAT IT WAS. >

06:56.567 --> 07:00.601
ONE... TWO... IT WAS DXL.

07:00.701 --> 07:02.868
WHAT THE HELL IS DXL?

07:02.968 --> 07:06.234
YOU MIX IT WITH ALCOHOL.
ONE HIT AND YOU FEEL DELICIOUS.

07:06.334 --> 07:08.133
SHE DIDN'T LOOK SO DELICIOUS.

07:08.234 --> 07:09.868
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHY SHE FLIPPED OUT.

07:09.968 --> 07:12.868
WHERE DO
WE SCORE THIS DXL?

07:12.968 --> 07:14.701
I JUST GOT IT.
IT'S NOT EVEN ON THE MARKET.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.901
I JUST MET THE GUY.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.300
HE GAVE ME SOME SAMPLES,

07:18.400 --> 07:19.901
HE TOLD ME TO START
SPREADING THE GOOD WORD.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.901
HE SAID THERE WOULD
BE A LOT MORE SOON.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.367
NOW HE'S GONE.
I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE.

07:24.467 --> 07:26.868
UGH...!

07:26.968 --> 07:31.100
I HATE IT...
WHEN PEOPLE LIE TO ME.

07:45.434 --> 07:46.868
WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO SPEAK ITALIAN?

07:46.968 --> 07:49.934
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU
DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME, BRENNAN.

07:51.067 --> 07:52.534
IT'S CALLED DEXFENFLURAMINE.

07:52.634 --> 07:54.133
AN ADULTERATED
FORM OF IT, ANYWAY.

07:54.234 --> 07:58.167
IT WAS DEVELOPED IN
THE EARLY DAYS OF GENOMEX
BY A DR. SARA STANTON.

07:58.267 --> 08:02.234
SO WHAT THE DRUG DOES IS
CREATE A HIGHLY POTENT SYNTHETIC

08:02.334 --> 08:04.667
FORM OF
SEROTONIN IN THE BODY.

08:04.767 --> 08:07.000
SO, WHAT, GENOMEX WAS IN
THE BUSINESS OF EXPERIMENTING

08:07.100 --> 08:08.701
WITH BETTER WAYS TO GET HIGH?

08:08.801 --> 08:11.200
ACTUALLY, THE PROJECT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT CONTROLLING

08:11.300 --> 08:13.601
MUTANT AGGRESSION, AND THE
NARCOTIC EFFECTS ON HUMANS WAS

08:13.701 --> 08:15.334
JUST A SIDE EFFECT...

08:15.434 --> 08:18.167
A HIGHLY
ADDICTIVE SIDE EFFECT.

08:18.267 --> 08:20.934
SO THE GOOD
DOCTOR HAD A TASTE FOR
HER OWN MEDICINE, HUH?

08:21.033 --> 08:23.300
STARTED GETTING
SLOPPY, MAKING MISTAKES.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.200
SHE EVEN STARTED
A RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE
OF HER MUTANT SUBJECTS.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.067
BUT THE KICKER CAME WHEN
ONE OF HER PATIENTS ACTUALLY

08:28.167 --> 08:30.000
DIED UNDER HER CARE.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.167
YEAH, SHE WAS
A REAL CUP OF SUNSHINE.

08:32.267 --> 08:33.900
YOU'RE BACK ON YOUR
FEET PRETTY QUICK.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU
WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.200
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.601
SEE, BEFORE ADAM
COULD HAVE DR. SARA ARRESTED

08:39.701 --> 08:42.567
HER LAB MYSTERIOUSLY
EXPLODED AND SHE VANISHED,

08:42.667 --> 08:45.434
UNTIL TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN
SHE WAS ARRESTED FOR DRUG

08:45.534 --> 08:47.133
TRAFFICKING ACROSS THE BORDER.

08:47.234 --> 08:48.634
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
SHE'S BEING HELD?

08:48.734 --> 08:50.067
A PLACE
CALLED CROWTER'S PRISON.

08:50.167 --> 08:52.701
I'VE GOT MY CONTACTS LINING ME
UP FOR THE NEXT PRISON TRANSFER.

08:52.801 --> 08:54.667
WHAT? WHAT,
WE'RE DEA NOW?

08:54.767 --> 08:56.667
BRENNAN, I COULD'VE
KILLED SOMEONE LAST NIGHT.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.467
IF THIS DRUG GOES WIDE,

08:58.567 --> 09:01.100
THERE'S NO TELLING HOW MANY
INNOCENT LIVES ARE AT STAKE.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.567
AND IS THAT IT?

09:02.667 --> 09:05.667
OR ARE YOU JUST LOOKING TO GET
YOUR HANDS ON HER FOR REVENGE?

09:05.767 --> 09:08.267
WHETHER YOU LIKE
IT OR NOT I'M GOING IN.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.200
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.968
THAT'S OKAY.
I'VE GOT IT COVERED.

09:14.067 --> 09:15.667
I WASN'T ASKING.

09:15.767 --> 09:17.567
SEE, THE POINT IS,
WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN,

09:17.667 --> 09:19.634
SO I'M GOING IN WITH YOU.

09:19.734 --> 09:22.567
WAIT... LADIES, LISTEN, THIS
AIN'T MAYBERRY. ALL RIGHT?

09:22.667 --> 09:24.234
THESE BACKWOODS LOCKUPS?

09:24.334 --> 09:27.133
THEY TEND TO BE SOME
SERIOUS KICK-ASS PLACES.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.000
DON'T YOU WORRY THEN,
BECAUSE I'M GOOD AND
READY TO KICK SOME ASS.

09:36.467 --> 09:38.501
I GOT THE RESULTS
OF LEXA'S BLOOD WORK BACK.

09:38.601 --> 09:40.067
AND?

09:40.167 --> 09:42.033
THE DRUG IS STILL
ACTIVE IN HER SYSTEM.

09:42.133 --> 09:43.801
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
- HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

09:43.901 --> 09:45.367
I'M NOT ENTIRELY CERTAIN.

09:45.467 --> 09:47.267
BUT FOR SOME
REASON IN MUTANTS,

09:47.367 --> 09:50.834
DXL SLOWLY PARALYZES
THE NERVOUS CENTERS.

09:50.934 --> 09:54.467
I HOPE THIS IS THE
PART WHERE YOU TELL ME IT'S
NOT AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS.

09:54.567 --> 09:56.968
SHE'S DYING, JESSE.

09:57.067 --> 10:00.734
TOTAL PARALYSIS
IS INEVITABLE.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.868
WELL, THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO.

10:03.968 --> 10:05.567
WELL, THEORETICALLY.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.834
BUT IN ORDER
TO CREATE AN ANTIDOTE,

10:07.934 --> 10:10.901
I NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY
HOW THE DRUG WAS MODIFIED.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.734
OTHERWISE,
IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.200
BUT WE
DON'T HAVE THAT LONG.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.000
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?

10:16.100 --> 10:18.701
SEVENTY-TWO
HOURS. MAYBE LESS.

10:28.467 --> 10:31.534
WELL, AREN'T YOU
A COUPLE OF BEAUTY QUEENS.

10:36.834 --> 10:40.033
IT'S TIME FOR
THE SWIMSUIT COMPETITION.

10:47.834 --> 10:50.234
STRIP DOWN.

11:03.734 --> 11:06.567
WE'LL START WITH
YOU FIRST, KITTEN.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.367
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
WANTED TO COME OUT AND PLAY.

11:10.467 --> 11:13.000
YOU'RE NEXT, PRINCESS.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.968
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
ME IF I TOLD YOU.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.534
TRY ME.

11:26.634 --> 11:28.534
OKAY.

11:28.634 --> 11:31.334
I SPENT SOME TIME IN A
GENETIC LABORATORY WHERE AN

11:31.434 --> 11:33.601
EGOMANIACAL FREAK TRIED
TO REWIRE MY NERVOUS SYSTEM

11:33.701 --> 11:36.467
TO TURN ME
INTO A ROBOT KILLER.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.901
I'M WATCHIN' YOU, SWEET PEA.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.667
NOW FINISH GETTING DRESSED.

11:47.767 --> 11:49.067
PEOPLE SAY THEY WANT THE TRUTH,

11:49.167 --> 11:51.701
BUT THEY NEVER
REALLY MEAN IT, DO THEY?

11:53.868 --> 11:56.000
<i>TAKE THEM TO THEIR CELLS.</i>

12:09.634 --> 12:10.667
BRENNAN?

12:10.767 --> 12:12.300
YEAH?

12:12.400 --> 12:14.067
LEXA'S DYING.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.067
WE'VE GOT TO GET HER
OUT OF THAT PRISON. NOW.

12:17.167 --> 12:18.734
LIKE THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.167
WHY?

12:20.267 --> 12:22.067
WE COULDN'T GET HER TO
LEAVE EVEN IF WE WANTED TO.

12:22.167 --> 12:24.033
BRENNAN, SHE NEEDS TO
KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HER.

12:24.133 --> 12:25.868
NO, THAT'S A BAD IDEA.

12:25.968 --> 12:28.000
LEXA KNOWS SHE'S DYING,

12:28.100 --> 12:30.033
THEN SHE'S GONNA GO
AFTER SARA SOMETHING FIERCE.

12:30.133 --> 12:32.567
AND WHY EXACTLY
IS THAT A BAD THING?

12:32.667 --> 12:35.767
SHE WENT TO
GO SEE THE NIGHTCLUB OWNER
AFTER WE LEFT LAST NIGHT.

12:35.868 --> 12:37.634
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

12:37.734 --> 12:39.667
HE'S DEAD.

12:39.767 --> 12:42.834
WE NEED TO KEEP LEXA IN THE
DARK IF WE HAVE ANY HOPES OF

12:42.934 --> 12:45.367
FINDING SARA AND
GETTING HER TO PLAY BALL.

12:45.467 --> 12:48.734
OKAY. OKAY, FINE.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.868
WE TELL SHALIMAR.

12:50.968 --> 12:54.300
WE TELL SHALIMAR
AND SHE DOESN'T LET
LEXA OUT OF HER SIGHT.

12:54.400 --> 12:59.234
YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT HER, AREN'T YOU?

12:59.334 --> 13:01.167
OF COURSE.

13:01.267 --> 13:03.834
SHE'S DYING, BRENNAN.

13:03.934 --> 13:05.667
WHAT? AREN'T YOU?

13:05.767 --> 13:08.133
YEAH. IT'S JUST...

13:08.234 --> 13:11.667
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN
YOU ACT THIS WAY BEFORE.

13:11.767 --> 13:14.133
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
HAVE A THING FOR HER?

13:14.234 --> 13:16.200
BRENNAN, TAKE A
LITTLE LOOK AROUND YOU.

13:16.300 --> 13:20.934
WE HAVEN'T
EXACTLY HAD THE GREATEST
TRACK RECORD RECENTLY.

13:21.033 --> 13:25.567
IT'D BE REALLY NICE
TO GO JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS
WITHOUT ONE OF US DYING.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.067
YOU KNOW?

13:28.167 --> 13:30.367
YEAH...

13:34.801 --> 13:38.033
YOU STILL DIDN'T
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

13:45.200 --> 13:58.634
<CAT CALLS>

14:00.300 --> 14:01.934
BACK OFF!

14:12.901 --> 14:17.100
'FRAID NOT, LITTLE DARLIN'.
YOU'RE COMIN' WITH ME.

14:24.934 --> 14:26.667
YOU'RE IN FOR A REAL RIDE.

14:26.767 --> 14:28.501
SHUT YOUR
FACE, MARTINEZ!

14:28.601 --> 14:30.901
LEAVE HER ALONE!

14:43.200 --> 14:47.067
YOU AND ME, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A REAL GOOD TIME.

14:54.267 --> 14:56.868
WE HAVE A RUNNER IN SOLITARY!

14:56.968 --> 15:00.167
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED. SHE SLIPPED AWAY!

15:11.234 --> 15:13.067
<LAUGHING>

15:13.167 --> 15:15.534
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

15:22.267 --> 15:25.567
<i>MAYBE NEXT TIME, ED.</i>

15:39.000 --> 15:40.634
HOW YOU DOIN'?

15:40.734 --> 15:43.234
WELL, IT AIN'T MY IDEA OF A
WEEKEND IN THE HAMPTONS, BUT...

15:43.334 --> 15:45.734
THERE SHE IS.

15:45.834 --> 15:47.601
DR. SARA.

15:47.701 --> 15:49.601
LOOKS LIKE SHE
HAD A ROUGH NIGHT.

15:49.701 --> 15:51.868
YEAH, SHE'S PROBABLY
BEEN GOING COLD TURKEY
SINCE SHE GOT IN THIS DUMP.

15:51.968 --> 15:54.334
WONDER HOW SHE
GOT SUCH A SWEET GIG?

15:54.434 --> 15:56.767
THINK I'LL FIND OUT.

16:03.534 --> 16:05.033
I'LL GET IT.

16:05.133 --> 16:06.968
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE HAD A LITTLE ASSISTANT.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.000
WELL,
NOW YOU DO. SO BACK OFF.

16:09.100 --> 16:12.467
HUH,
IT'S FUNNY, I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO TELL YOU THE SAME THING.

16:12.567 --> 16:13.634
HEY!

16:13.734 --> 16:15.934
<i>HEY, HEY, HEY! SETTLE.</i>

16:20.367 --> 16:23.400
CHILL OUT.
WE DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.000
<i>ALL CLEAR OVER HERE.</i>

16:30.100 --> 16:31.901
OKAY,
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.734
A FIGHT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I NEED TO OPEN UP MY PROFILE.

16:33.834 --> 16:35.133
OKAY, WELL,
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

16:35.234 --> 16:36.934
I DON'T THINK
NOW'S THE TIME.

16:37.033 --> 16:39.167
I'LL FIND ANOTHER
WAY TO GET TO HER.

16:39.267 --> 16:41.534
ALL RIGHT.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.234
YOU'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES.

16:55.334 --> 16:57.133
THANKS.

17:01.868 --> 17:03.267
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:03.367 --> 17:07.467
IT'S LEXA. THE DRUG
IS STILL IN HER SYSTEM.

17:07.567 --> 17:10.601
IT'S KILLING HER.

17:10.701 --> 17:13.834
AND SHE'S GOING TO DIE
UNLESS WE GET AN ANTIDOTE.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.032
WELL,
CAN'T DR. MARCUS...?

17:19.133 --> 17:21.567
NO. THERE'S ONLY ONE
PERSON WHO CAN HELP HER.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.467
IT'S DR. SARA.

17:23.567 --> 17:26.000
JUST PROCEED AS PLANNED.

17:26.099 --> 17:27.934
YOU UNDERSTAND?

17:28.032 --> 17:29.968
YEAH.
BUT WE HAVE TO TELL HER.

17:30.067 --> 17:33.267
NO.
IT'LL MAKE MATTERS WORSE.

17:33.367 --> 17:35.934
BUT YOU'VE
GOT TO GET TO SARA.

17:36.033 --> 17:38.367
IT'S LEXA'S ONLY CHANCE.

17:38.467 --> 17:40.200
OKAY.

17:40.300 --> 17:44.100
SHALIMAR, KEEP YOUR EYES
ON HER. AND KEEP IN TOUCH.

17:44.200 --> 17:48.834
HOW?

17:58.901 --> 18:01.968
I MISS YOU, BABY.

18:28.334 --> 18:31.067
IT'S KEYED INTO
BOTH YOURS AND LEXA'S DNA.

18:34.367 --> 18:37.667
I THOUGHT SARA COULD
USE A LITTLE INCENTIVE.

18:37.767 --> 18:39.767
BE CAREFUL WITH IT.
IT COULD KILL YOU, TOO.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.434
OKAY.

18:41.534 --> 18:43.234
OKAY.

18:43.334 --> 18:45.033
GOOD LUCK.

18:45.133 --> 18:47.434
THANKS.

18:51.801 --> 18:54.100
ALL RIGHT. I BROUGHT
SHALIMAR UP TO SPEED.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.200
I THINK I
FOUND SARA'S PARTNER.

18:56.300 --> 19:00.033
I HACKED INTO THE
PRISON'S VISITATION RECORDS.

19:00.133 --> 19:01.501
HECTOR FREIMARK.

19:01.601 --> 19:03.734
HE'S ALSO THE MUTANT
THAT SHE WAS HANGING AROUND

19:03.834 --> 19:05.133
WITH BACK IN HER GENOMEX DAYS.

19:05.234 --> 19:06.701
WOW.

19:06.801 --> 19:09.067
WHAT? YOU THINK YOU'RE THE
ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO
WORK THE COMPUTER?

19:09.167 --> 19:10.567
NO, NO.
I'M IMPRESSED. GO ON.

19:10.667 --> 19:14.033
WELL, I ALSO CROSS-REFERENCED
HIM IN THE MUTANT DATABASE -

19:14.133 --> 19:17.834
HE'S A MOLECULAR WITH THE
ABILITY TO CREATE EXPLOSIONS.

19:17.934 --> 19:20.367
MMM, LIKE THE EXPLOSION
AT DR. SARA'S LAB, HUH?

19:20.467 --> 19:22.000
EXACTLY.

19:22.100 --> 19:23.534
HMM.

19:23.634 --> 19:25.033
THE THING THAT I
DON'T UNDERSTAND, THOUGH,

19:25.133 --> 19:26.701
IS IF THIS DRUG
IS AS DEADLY TO MUTANTS AS

19:26.801 --> 19:28.734
DR. MARCUS SAYS IT IS, THEN WHAT
THE HELL IS HE DOING HANGING

19:28.834 --> 19:31.801
OUT WITH AN ADDICT WHO
CAN CHURN IT OUT BY THE TON?

19:43.567 --> 19:45.968
WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS IT?
I REALLY NEED IT.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.400
I KNOW. I COULDN'T RISK
BRINGING IT IN HERE.

19:47.501 --> 19:48.701
NOT NOW.

19:48.801 --> 19:50.000
YOU DID SO.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.100
HEY - YOU JUST GOTTA STAY
COOL A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.968
THAT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH ANY MORE.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.734
I WANT OUT OF HERE.

19:55.834 --> 19:59.234
SARA, I KNOW YOU'RE HURTING,
BUT WE ARE SO CLOSE.

19:59.334 --> 20:01.400
NOW I'M OUT THERE
TRYING TO... TRYING
TO RUN A BUSINESS.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.701
NOW,
YOU GIVE ME THE FORMULA,

20:02.801 --> 20:04.467
I'LL HAVE THE MONEY TO
GET YOU OUT OF THIS PLACE.

20:04.567 --> 20:05.667
DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

20:05.767 --> 20:07.234
IF YOU WANTED
ME OUT OF THIS PLACE,

20:07.334 --> 20:08.801
YOU COULD'VE BLOWN
UP HALF THE PRISON BY NOW.

20:08.901 --> 20:10.400
AND THEN WE'D BE
THROWING AWAY EVERYTHING
WE WORKED FOR.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.801
YOU KNOW THAT.

20:11.901 --> 20:13.467
ALL I KNOW IS THAT I'M
REALLY TIRED OF YOUR EXCUSES.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.133
GET ME OUT OF HERE NOW.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.100
I TOLD YOU, I CAN'T.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.834
YOU BETTER.

20:19.934 --> 20:22.300
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M REALLY
STARTING TO WONDER HOW THE COPS

20:22.400 --> 20:24.100
KNEW WHERE I
WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.868
YOU THINK I HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT?

20:25.968 --> 20:27.300
YOU'RE PARANOID.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.300
REALLY?
I'M STARTING TO SEE THINGS
THE WAY THEY REALLY ARE.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.634
YOU GET ME OUT OF HERE BY
TOMORROW MORNING OR I'M GOING TO

20:31.734 --> 20:34.234
START MAKING
FRIENDS WITH THE DEA.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.534
NOW WHO'S PARANOID?

20:40.367 --> 20:41.701
DOCTOR?

20:41.801 --> 20:44.467
TELL ME YOU'VE MADE
SOME HEADWAY IN THE ANTIDOTE.

20:44.567 --> 20:45.901
I WISH.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.334
BUT WITHOUT KNOWING HOW
THE DRUG HAS BEEN MODIFIED,

20:48.434 --> 20:50.634
I'M SIMPLY THROWING DARTS.

20:50.734 --> 20:53.033
HOW IS SHE?

20:53.133 --> 20:55.667
SO FAR, NO CHANGE.

20:55.767 --> 20:58.400
THE TREMORS WILL GET WORSE.

20:58.501 --> 21:00.701
SOON SHE WON'T
BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEM.

21:00.801 --> 21:05.634
I HOPE YOU
REALIZE THE EPIDEMIC THIS
COULD CAUSE IF DXL GETS OUT.

21:05.734 --> 21:07.934
IT COULD BE THE
END OF ALL MUTANTS.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.601
I HADN'T EVEN
THOUGHT OF THAT.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.868
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND HARSH,
BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO ACCEPT

21:11.968 --> 21:14.601
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GREATER
AT STAKE THAN SAVING LEXA.

21:27.601 --> 21:29.501
HEY.

21:29.601 --> 21:31.701
HEY.

21:31.801 --> 21:34.200
LISTEN,
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE,
AND WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.200
I WANT TO
BE A PART OF IT.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.801
OH, YEAH?

21:37.901 --> 21:38.667
WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME?

21:38.767 --> 21:40.834
AH...

21:46.801 --> 21:48.200
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

21:48.300 --> 21:49.834
AROUND A FEW CLUBS.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.267
STUFF'S NOT EASY
TO COME BY, YOU KNOW.

21:52.367 --> 21:54.767
IT'S GONNA CHANGE
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

21:54.868 --> 21:57.734
THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR.

21:57.834 --> 22:02.901
LISTEN, MY BUYERS ARE ITCHING
TO GET IN ON SOME OF THE ACTION.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.434
THINK YOU CAN HOOK US UP?

22:05.534 --> 22:07.901
MMM, YOU NEVER KNOW.

22:12.901 --> 22:15.167
AAGGH...!

22:16.133 --> 22:17.601
COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

22:17.701 --> 22:19.801
COME ON.

22:29.767 --> 22:31.968
WELL, SHE'S GOT A HELL
OF A WAY TO ASK FOR A RAISE.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.200
MORE LIKE SHE GOT OTHER
ORDERS FROM MY BOYFRIEND.

22:35.300 --> 22:38.133
WE'RE IN
BUSINESS TOGETHER.

22:38.234 --> 22:41.033
WELL, IT MUST
BE A GOOD BUSINESS.

22:41.133 --> 22:43.534
GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM TO
TRY TO DOUBLE HIS PROFIT.

22:43.634 --> 22:45.100
YOU KNOW, IF I WERE YOU,

22:45.200 --> 22:47.267
I'D START THINKING ABOUT
TAKING ON A NEW PARTNER.

22:47.367 --> 22:51.601
GOT FRIENDS ON THE OUTSIDE
WHO ARE DESPERATE TO GET IN.

22:51.701 --> 22:53.968
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

22:54.067 --> 22:56.968
I'LL FIGURE OUT
SOMETHING FOR MYSELF.

22:59.267 --> 23:01.467
TAKE A LOOK AROUND, SARA.

23:01.567 --> 23:05.400
I'M THE ONLY
FRIEND YOU'VE GOT.

23:08.434 --> 23:10.501
THE ONLY WAY THAT I WOULD
CUT YOU OR ANYONE ELSE IN IS IF

23:10.601 --> 23:12.701
THEY COULD GET ME ON
THE OUTSIDE OF THESE BARS.

23:12.801 --> 23:17.100
YEAH? WHAT IF
I COULD ARRANGE THAT?

23:17.200 --> 23:21.968
YEAH?
AN ESCAPE? BY TOMORROW?

23:25.934 --> 23:29.501
NO, FORGET IT.
I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

23:34.300 --> 23:35.734
ALL RIGHT,
SO I TALKED TO SHALIMAR.

23:35.834 --> 23:37.734
SHE FIGURES THE BEST TIME FOR
AN ESCAPE IS DURING WORK DETAIL.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.334
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT?

23:40.434 --> 23:43.734
YEAH. THAT WAY ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS DEAL WITH THE GUARDS.

23:43.834 --> 23:46.033
A LOT LESS TO TRY
AND CONTROL THAT WAY.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.868
ONLY THE GUARDS.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.534
BRENNAN, GUARDS WITH GUNS.

23:50.634 --> 23:53.067
GUARDS...
GUARDS WITH GUNS WHO
ARE JUST WAITING FOR THEM

23:53.167 --> 23:54.834
TO MAKE A MOVE - COME ON.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.167
EVEN WITH LEXA'S ABILITY,
THREE GIRLS VANISHING IS GOING

23:57.267 --> 23:59.300
TO BE A
LITTLE BIT HARD TO MISS.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.701
YEAH.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING IN
WITH A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH.

24:02.801 --> 24:04.801
SHALIMAR'S GOING TO CREATE A
DIVERSION, GIVE THE GIRLS A

24:04.901 --> 24:06.601
CHANCE TO SLIP AWAY, FIND
THEIR WAY BACK TO THE HELIX.

24:06.701 --> 24:08.200
AND THEN
WHAT ABOUT SHALIMAR?

24:08.300 --> 24:10.334
WELL,
ONCE THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON THEY'RE GOING TO

24:10.434 --> 24:12.434
GATHER ALL THE INMATES UP,
THEY'RE GOING TO SEND THEM BACK

24:12.534 --> 24:17.567
TO LOCKUP - THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE
AN EASIER CHANCE OF GETTING HER.

24:17.667 --> 24:20.767
IT COULD WORK.

24:20.868 --> 24:23.734
IT WILL WORK.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.868
HOW'D IT GO WITH SARA?

24:33.968 --> 24:35.767
THE HARDER I PUSH,
THE MORE SHE RUNS AWAY.

24:35.868 --> 24:38.100
<i>OKAY,
OPEN THE GATE.</i>

24:39.868 --> 24:41.567
THE GUYS HAVE A WAY TO
BREAK US OUT ON WORK DETAIL,

24:41.667 --> 24:43.434
BUT WE NEED SARA ON BOARD.

24:43.534 --> 24:47.000
MAYBE IT'S TIME I PUT
MY CARDS ON THE TABLE.

24:59.734 --> 25:01.734
LAST CHANCE, SARA.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.300
FOR WHAT?

25:04.400 --> 25:06.601
WE'VE GOT A PLAN TO BREAK
YOU OUT DURING WORK DETAIL.

25:06.701 --> 25:09.234
YOU NUTS?
THEY'LL SHOOT US ON SIGHT.

25:09.334 --> 25:11.968
NOT IF THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE SHOOTING AT.

25:19.634 --> 25:23.033
YOU'RE A MUTANT.

25:23.133 --> 25:25.734
LISTEN TO ME,
TAKE A BREATH.

25:25.834 --> 25:27.567
DEEP BREATH.

25:27.667 --> 25:30.501
JUST LET IT PASS.

25:30.601 --> 25:33.033
HERE, SIT DOWN.

25:35.133 --> 25:38.267
WHO SENT YOU?
ADAM KANE?

25:42.567 --> 25:44.801
HE'S DEAD.

25:44.901 --> 25:50.000
OH, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.
HE COMPLETELY RUINED MY CAREER.

25:50.100 --> 25:51.667
YEAH,
I MET HIM A FEW TIMES,

25:51.767 --> 25:54.033
BUT I KNEW HE
COULDN'T BE TRUSTED.

25:54.133 --> 25:56.501
HE ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE A
HIDDEN AGENDA OF SOME SORT.

25:56.601 --> 25:58.934
YEAH. THAT'S ADAM.

25:59.033 --> 26:01.801
YEAH.

26:05.467 --> 26:07.801
GENOMEX HAD ME DEVELOP THIS
DRUG - TO ELIMINATE MUTANTS,

26:07.901 --> 26:09.734
IN CASE IT GOT
TO THE POINT WHERE THEY
COULDN'T CONTAIN THEM.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.734
WAIT A MINUTE
- ADAM KNEW ABOUT THIS?

26:11.834 --> 26:13.400
HE WAS DEEP IN THE COMPANY.

26:13.501 --> 26:15.000
YEAH, HE KNEW.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.968
I ASSUME YOU'RE
HERE FOR THE ANTIDOTE.

26:18.067 --> 26:22.200
YOUR TREMORS,
THE BLACKOUTS...

26:22.300 --> 26:25.934
YOU'RE DYING.

26:26.033 --> 26:28.234
WHA...?

26:28.334 --> 26:30.300
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

26:30.400 --> 26:33.300
WHAT DID YOU THINK
WAS HAPPENING TO YOU?

26:33.400 --> 26:36.968
YOU'RE LYING.

26:37.067 --> 26:39.667
NO. I DEVELOPED
THE DRUG, SWEETHEART.

26:39.767 --> 26:42.868
I PROMISE YOU, IT'S A MEDICAL
CERTAINTY - BY TOMORROW,

26:42.968 --> 26:47.400
YOU'LL BE LUCKY IF
YOU CAN EVEN DRAW A BREATH.

26:47.501 --> 26:49.834
ARE YOU ASKING
YOURSELF IF I CAN HELP?

26:49.934 --> 26:52.334
I'LL SAVE YOU
THE SUSPENSE: YEAH, I CAN.

26:52.434 --> 26:57.133
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

26:57.234 --> 27:00.834
TAKE A WILD GUESS.

27:11.767 --> 27:14.467
LEXA.
ARE YOU THERE?

27:22.367 --> 27:24.400
YEAH.

27:24.501 --> 27:26.434
SARA'S ON BOARD.

27:26.534 --> 27:29.868
GOOD.

27:29.968 --> 27:33.334
SO WHEN WERE YOU GUYS PLANNING
ON TELLING ME I WAS DYING?

27:36.634 --> 27:39.667
GUESS IT KINDA
SLIPPED YOUR MIND, HUH?

27:39.767 --> 27:41.834
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, LEXA.

27:41.934 --> 27:44.934
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN
ABOUT SAVING YOUR LIFE.

27:45.033 --> 27:47.801
WELL, RELAX.
SARA'S GOT AN ANTIDOTE.

27:53.534 --> 27:55.167
THAT'S GREAT.

27:55.267 --> 27:57.601
YEP.

27:57.701 --> 28:00.834
SO, LOOKS LIKE I'M
DODGING ONE HELL OF A BULLET.

28:07.234 --> 28:12.667
LOOK, TAKE THIS.

28:15.868 --> 28:18.801
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
IT TOMORROW MORE THAN I AM.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.167
THANKS.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.167
AGHH!

28:34.801 --> 28:36.767
LET 'EM PLAY.

28:38.634 --> 28:41.267
<LAUGHING>
HOPE YOU DIDN'T
DIRTY YOUR OUTFIT.

28:41.367 --> 28:44.000
THAT'S IT,
BITCH. YOU'RE MINE.

28:44.100 --> 28:45.567
I'M GONNA TEAR YOU UP.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.133
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, MARTINEZ?

28:47.234 --> 28:48.701
AGHH...!

28:52.267 --> 28:54.000
MAYBE I SHOULD
GO LOOKING FOR HER.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.667
LOOK, IF THERE'S
ANY KIND OF A PROBLEM SHE
WOULD'VE GIVEN US A HEADS UP.

28:56.767 --> 28:57.934
HOW?

28:58.033 --> 29:00.534
WITH THE COMLINK. SHALIMAR
GAVE IT TO HER LAST NIGHT.

29:00.634 --> 29:02.000
ALL RIGHT.

29:02.100 --> 29:04.067
I KNOW YOU'RE
NERVOUS, ALRIGHT,

29:04.167 --> 29:06.567
BUT EVERYTHING IS
GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN.

29:06.667 --> 29:07.901
PLANS, BRENNAN
- AGAIN, SHE'S DYING.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.400
YEAH. I KNOW.

29:09.501 --> 29:11.834
OKAY? WE JUST NEED
TO GIVE HER SOME TIME.

29:11.934 --> 29:14.367
TIME IS THE ONE THING SHE
DOESN'T HAVE RIGHT NOW, BRENNAN.

29:15.467 --> 29:24.200
<CHEERING>

29:24.300 --> 29:26.000
IS THAT ALL
YOU GOT, MARTINEZ?

29:26.100 --> 29:28.601
OH, I'M NOT DONE
WITH YOU BY A LONG SHOT.

29:28.701 --> 29:43.734
<CHEERING>

29:45.567 --> 29:47.367
OKAY, SOMETHING IS
WRONG - I CAN FEEL IT.

29:47.467 --> 29:49.067
ALL RIGHT
- TRY HER AGAIN.

29:49.167 --> 29:51.801
LEXA, WHAT'S GOING
ON? WHERE ARE YOU?

29:52.634 --> 29:55.267
<CHEERING>

30:15.133 --> 30:17.133
THERE'S BEEN AN ESCAPE!

30:17.234 --> 30:18.868
GRAB THOSE TWO.

30:18.968 --> 30:21.667
LADIES, FALL IN LINE.

30:27.033 --> 30:30.501
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, LET'S MOVE.

30:30.601 --> 30:32.934
<i>LEXA, I KNOW YOU
CAN HEAR ME. ARE YOU HURT?</i>

30:33.033 --> 30:34.300
IT'S OVER, JESS.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:36.100 --> 30:37.834
LET'S JUST SAY THERE'S
BEEN A CHANGE OF PLANS.

30:37.934 --> 30:39.801
CHANGE HOW?

30:39.901 --> 30:41.834
WE CAN HELP YOU.

30:41.934 --> 30:43.801
WE'RE WAY PAST THAT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

30:43.901 --> 30:47.200
LEXA, GIVE US YOUR LOCATION,
WE'LL COME AND PICK YOU UP.

30:47.300 --> 30:49.601
DON'T SWEAT IT.

30:49.701 --> 30:52.367
I'M NOT YOUR PROBLEM ANY MORE.

30:52.467 --> 30:54.267
LEXA, NO.
YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO ME.

30:54.367 --> 30:56.367
LEXA!

30:57.634 --> 30:59.000
DAMMIT!

30:59.100 --> 31:01.100
SO MUCH FOR THINGS GOING
ACCORDING TO PLANS, HUH?

31:01.200 --> 31:03.267
COME ON,
JESSE, THERE'S NO WAY WE
COULDA PREDICTED THIS.

31:03.367 --> 31:04.667
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:04.767 --> 31:06.901
BUT THE ONE THING I DO KNOW
IS IF WE DON'T FIND HER SOON

31:07.000 --> 31:09.567
SHE'S GONNA DIE.

31:30.834 --> 31:35.300
I DON'T GET IT.
WHY WOULD LEXA BLOW US OFF?

31:35.400 --> 31:37.868
MAYBE SARA NOTICED THE
DXL POISONING HER SYSTEM.

31:37.968 --> 31:39.434
YEAH.

31:39.534 --> 31:41.701
USED THAT TO MANIPULATE HER.

31:41.801 --> 31:44.067
USED THAT TIME BOMB
INSIDE OF HER AS A ONE-WAY
TICKET OUT OF PRISON.

31:44.167 --> 31:46.734
THIS WOULD NOT BE
HAPPENING IF WE'D LEVELLED
WITH HER TO BEGIN WITH.

31:46.834 --> 31:48.033
YOU KNOW WHAT, JESS, PLEASE?

31:48.133 --> 31:49.834
DON'T GO THERE.

31:49.934 --> 31:52.334
THERE'S GOTTA
BE A WAY TO FIND LEXA.

31:52.434 --> 31:53.734
HOW?

31:53.834 --> 31:55.200
IF SARA'S THE ONE
CALLING THE SHOTS RIGHT NOW,

31:55.300 --> 31:57.133
THEN THERE'S NO
TELLING WHERE THEY'RE AT.

31:57.234 --> 31:59.968
<SIGHS>

32:00.067 --> 32:03.634
WAIT A MINUTE:
IF THE DEAL'S GOING DOWN TODAY,

32:03.734 --> 32:07.200
THEN THE DXL
LAB HAS GOTTA BE CLOSE.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.501
WHAT DO WE DO? JUST GO
KNOCKING DOOR TO DOOR?

32:09.601 --> 32:12.067
I MIGHT HAVE A
WAY TO NARROW THAT DOWN.

32:12.167 --> 32:13.667
ALL RIGHT,
GET ON IT THEN.

32:13.767 --> 32:15.534
I'LL SEE IF I CAN BREAK
SHALIMAR OUT OF CROWTERS.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.133
OKAY, CAN YOU
COVER THAT ON YOUR OWN?

32:17.234 --> 32:20.334
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WOMEN IN PRISON? MY SPECIALTY.

32:20.434 --> 32:22.868
WHAT A GUY.

32:26.968 --> 32:29.968
DR. MARCUS, YOU SAID THAT YOU
COULDN'T DETERMINE HOW DXL WAS

32:30.067 --> 32:32.968
GENETICALLY MODIFIED BECAUSE OF
THE PROCESSING PROCEDURE, RIGHT?

32:33.067 --> 32:34.667
<i>YES.</i>

32:34.767 --> 32:37.234
OKAY, COULD YOU AT LEAST
TELL ME WHAT CHEMICALS ARE
USED IN THAT PROCESS?

32:37.334 --> 32:39.300
<i>WELL,
LITHIUM ALUMINUM HYDRIDE.</i>

32:39.400 --> 32:41.267
<i>BUT I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT WOULD HELP.</i>

32:41.367 --> 32:42.667
LITHIUM ALUMINUM HYDRIDE.

32:42.767 --> 32:44.467
THANK YOU.

32:45.501 --> 32:47.634
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FRIENDS?

32:47.734 --> 32:51.734
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
THEY'VE SLIPPED THROUGH
THE CRACKS OF YOUR SYSTEM.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.667
AGHH!

32:56.767 --> 32:58.200
WE SAW YOU TOGETHER.

32:58.300 --> 33:00.267
YOU JUST STARTED THAT FIGHT
SO YOU COULD BUY THEM SOME TIME.

33:00.367 --> 33:03.667
I WANT TO TALK TO MY LAWYER.

33:03.767 --> 33:05.400
HONEY, YOU'RE GONNA BE TALKING
TO A CORONER PRETTY SOON IF

33:05.501 --> 33:07.300
YOU DON'T TELL
ME WHERE THEY ARE.

33:07.400 --> 33:11.934
ONE LAST TIME,
WHERE ARE THEY?

33:12.033 --> 33:13.634
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY RYKER'S ISLAND?

33:13.734 --> 33:17.000
I HEAR THE FOOD'S BETTER.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.634
UGH!

33:21.868 --> 33:23.200
WE'RE RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

33:23.300 --> 33:25.234
I THINK YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY
WITH THE QUALITY OF THE, UH,

33:25.334 --> 33:26.968
MATERIAL WE'RE
DEALING WITH HERE.

33:27.067 --> 33:29.100
HEY! EASY WITH THAT.

33:35.267 --> 33:36.868
I'LL SAY THIS
FOR YOU, KITTEN.

33:36.968 --> 33:39.634
YOU'RE EITHER STUPID
OR A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT.

33:39.734 --> 33:41.367
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

33:41.467 --> 33:43.167
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

33:43.267 --> 33:44.801
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

33:44.901 --> 33:46.434
DIAL IT UP A FEW NOTCHES.

33:46.534 --> 33:48.667
AND DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

33:52.234 --> 33:53.701
I WON'T.

33:53.801 --> 33:56.000
AGH!

33:57.901 --> 34:00.200
GUARDS!
SOMEBODY HELP ME! GUARDS!

34:01.901 --> 34:04.801
LET'S SEE HOW
MUCH YOU LIKE IT.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.967
BACK.

34:13.534 --> 34:15.534
AGAINST THE WALL.

34:20.567 --> 34:22.467
YOU OKAY?

34:22.567 --> 34:24.199
YEAH.

34:24.300 --> 34:26.199
BRENNAN!

34:31.667 --> 34:33.234
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

34:33.333 --> 34:35.701
DON'T ASK.
LEXA DITCHED US.

34:41.167 --> 34:42.934
ANY LUCK?

34:43.033 --> 34:46.467
YEAH. I TRACED THE CHEMICAL
REQUIRED TO PROCESS DXL.

34:46.567 --> 34:48.100
IT'S CALLED LITHIUM
ALUMINUM HYDRIDE.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.734
IT'S QUITE RARE
AND HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE.

34:49.833 --> 34:52.467
A LARGE SHIPMENT WAS
RECENTLY DELIVERED TO A FARM
NOT FAR FROM THE PRISON.

34:52.567 --> 34:54.266
NICE WORK.

34:54.367 --> 34:56.434
LOOKS LIKE OUR DAY'S
GETTIN' BETTER AFTER ALL.

34:56.534 --> 34:58.701
OUR DAY AIN'T OVER YET.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.100
I'M SURE HECTOR'S GOT HIS
MEN SCOUTING THE PERIMETERS.

35:10.434 --> 35:12.634
WELL, DON'T WORRY.

35:12.734 --> 35:14.267
OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND.

35:14.367 --> 35:17.033
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

35:27.634 --> 35:30.501
<GASPING>

35:30.601 --> 35:31.734
HELP ME.

35:31.834 --> 35:33.200
I DON'T THINK SO.

35:33.300 --> 35:34.601
WE HAD A DEAL.

35:34.701 --> 35:36.400
SO WHAT? I'M SICK OF PEOPLE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME.

35:36.501 --> 35:38.234
YOU AND HECTOR AND ADAM.

35:38.334 --> 35:40.734
I'M GOING TO WORK
FOR MYSELF FOR A CHANGE.

35:40.834 --> 35:43.267
YOU SAY HI TO
ADAM WHEN YOU SEE HIM.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.033
WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
GOT EVERYTHING SEWN UP.

36:01.133 --> 36:04.667
YOU FORGOT ONE
LITTLE DETAIL - ME.

36:04.767 --> 36:05.901
SARA...

36:06.000 --> 36:08.467
GET EVERYBODY OUT.
PUT YOUR GUN DOWN.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.434
PUT IT DOWN, NOW.

36:10.534 --> 36:12.868
GO.
I'VE GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL.

36:21.434 --> 36:23.801
BABY,
PUT DOWN THE GUN.

36:23.901 --> 36:26.367
OH,
I WOULDN'T DO THAT, HECTOR.

36:26.467 --> 36:29.167
YOU MAKE SO MUCH AS A SPARK,
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE TOAST.

36:29.267 --> 36:30.934
LISTEN, BABY, WE'LL
PLAY THIS ANY WAY YOU WANT.

36:31.033 --> 36:32.567
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

36:32.667 --> 36:38.100
SO, WHY
DON'T YOU COME OVER HERE,
HAVE A LITTLE TASTE...

36:44.234 --> 36:46.701
AND WE'LL DISCUSS THIS.

36:59.701 --> 37:01.501
LEXA!

37:01.601 --> 37:04.701
GET HER OUT OF HERE.
I'M GETTING THE ANTIDOTE.

37:04.801 --> 37:06.334
YOU GOT HER?

37:08.634 --> 37:10.234
JESS, GET DOWN!

37:27.200 --> 37:31.567
OKAY, WHY NOT?

37:38.033 --> 37:39.634
WHERE IS IT?

37:39.734 --> 37:41.667
WHERE'S THE ANTIDOTE?

37:48.367 --> 37:51.734
<SCREAMING>

37:56.200 --> 37:58.200
JESSE! DON'T!

38:01.701 --> 38:03.267
COME ON, SHAL,
GET OUT OF HERE.

38:03.367 --> 38:05.934
AGHH...!

38:18.868 --> 38:20.901
SHE'S NOT BREATHING.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.033
HOLD ON.

38:28.300 --> 38:33.067
<GRUNTING>

38:40.968 --> 38:42.801
COME ON.

38:45.334 --> 38:47.567
NOTHING.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.334
SORRY, JESSE.

38:50.434 --> 38:52.868
NO!

38:58.200 --> 39:01.033
COME ON!

39:06.367 --> 39:08.801
I GOT A PULSE.

39:11.167 --> 39:13.200
HEY. - HEY.

39:26.100 --> 39:29.734
HEY.
YOU FEELIN' ANY BETTER?

39:29.834 --> 39:32.167
IT'S AMAZING
HOW YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED
THE LITTLE THINGS,

39:32.267 --> 39:34.767
YOU KNOW,
LIKE SHOWERING ALONE.

39:34.868 --> 39:39.067
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU,
UH, MISS THE COMPANY, THEN...

39:44.300 --> 39:47.300
YOU WISH.

39:49.534 --> 39:51.901
SO WHAT'S THE WORD?

39:52.000 --> 39:56.400
WELL,
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE...

39:56.501 --> 39:59.901
THE ENTIRE SHIPMENT
OF DXL WENT UP IN FLAMES.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.033
THE BAD NEWS IS,
SO DID THE INVENTOR.

40:03.133 --> 40:06.567
WELL, AT LEAST
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO LEXA
WON'T HAPPEN TO ANYBODY ELSE.

40:06.667 --> 40:09.267
AMEN TO THAT.

40:09.367 --> 40:10.801
GOOD TO SEE YA.

40:10.901 --> 40:13.434
WELL,
IT'S GOOD TO BE SEEN.

40:13.534 --> 40:16.801
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND WHY
WE CHOSE TO KEEP YOU IN THE DARK

40:16.901 --> 40:19.133
AS FAR AS YOUR
HEALTH WAS CONCERNED.

40:19.234 --> 40:22.534
YEAH,
I FIGURED YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
SPEARHEADED THAT DECISION.

40:26.267 --> 40:29.300
IT'S OKAY. I WOULDA DONE THE
SAME THING IN YOUR SHOES.

40:31.267 --> 40:33.534
SO DID DR. MARCUS GIVE
YOU A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH?

40:33.634 --> 40:37.033
NEXT BEST THING: THERE'S NOT A
TRACE OF DXL LEFT IN MY SYSTEM.

40:37.133 --> 40:38.801
WELL, YOU HAVE JESS
TO THANK FOR THAT ONE.

40:38.901 --> 40:40.100
YEAH, I KNOW.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.701
YOU GUYS KNOW WHERE HE IS?

40:41.801 --> 40:43.767
IN THE LAB, I THINK.

40:43.868 --> 40:46.033
THANKS.

40:52.701 --> 40:55.000
HEY,
I HEARD THE GOOD NEWS.

40:55.100 --> 40:56.701
THANKS TO YOU.

40:56.801 --> 40:59.234
YOU TOOK QUITE THE RISK.

40:59.334 --> 41:02.434
GOES WITH THE TERRITORY.

41:02.534 --> 41:04.767
FOR YOU, MAYBE.

41:04.868 --> 41:08.868
GUESS I'M WIRED DIFFERENTLY.

41:08.968 --> 41:12.267
I SUPPOSED THAT'S
WHY I'VE LEARNED TO KEEP
PEOPLE AT AN ARM'S LENGTH.

41:16.467 --> 41:20.667
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY
SAD WAY TO GO THROUGH LIFE.

41:20.767 --> 41:24.901
YEAH, WELL,
PERSONAL FEELINGS TEND
TO GET IN THE WAY.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.067
IT'S ALL ABOUT SURVIVAL.

41:27.167 --> 41:28.767
IF IT WASN'T
FOR PERSONAL FEELINGS,

41:28.868 --> 41:31.067
YOU WOULDN'T BE STANDING HERE
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW THAT?

41:31.167 --> 41:33.567
YEAH.

41:33.667 --> 41:37.234
WELL,
HOW DOES THAT FACTOR
INTO YOUR EQUATION?

41:37.334 --> 41:40.334
I DON'T KNOW. GUESS I'M STILL
TRYING TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.

41:44.934 --> 41:47.534
YEAH.
