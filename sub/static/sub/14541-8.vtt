40:43.483 --> 40:45.770
I've got something for you.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.609
Where did you get that?

40:53.701 --> 40:55.988
No, the point is I got it.

40:57.246 --> 40:59.988
So now you have everything you need.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.592
- Grace.
- What do you want, Randall?

41:19.811 --> 41:21.643
You should come see this.

41:23.022 --> 41:25.855
This isn't a trick. I'm not gonna hurt you.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.228
But you need to see this.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.353
It has ramifications for all of us.

41:34.659 --> 41:38.653
FLYNN: See that? Ben's pendant,
heading east from Wisconsin.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.781
In the last <i>72</i> hours,
it took off to Philadelphia like a shot.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.871
- What happened?
- My best guess...

41:46.087 --> 41:48.795
...I bet General Monroe's got it right now.

41:49.674 --> 41:51.164
What are you gonna do about it?

41:53.052 --> 41:55.919
I'm not gonna do anything about it, Grace.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.680
You are.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.610
