WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:03.394
- PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...
- WHERE'S BELLAMY?

00:03.438 --> 00:05.440
ECHO: IT TOOK HIM.
TOWARDS THE ANOMALY.

00:05.483 --> 00:06.919
WE NEED TO GET TO BELLAMY.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.878
HER BROTHER IS HERE.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.358
I NEED HER TO
TALK HIM DOWN.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.142
NO ONE ELSE
HAS TO DIE.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.926
BELLAMY: LET HER GO
RIGHT NOW.

00:13.970 --> 00:16.538
ANDERS: LET THE CONDUCTOR GO,
AND THEN WE CAN TALK.

00:16.581 --> 00:19.062
OPEN THE BRIDGE AND SEND
HIM BACK TO SANCTUM.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.890
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

00:20.933 --> 00:23.458
MAN: FOR ALL MANKIND.

00:23.501 --> 00:26.417
OCTAVIA:
BELLAMY, GET DOWN!

00:26.461 --> 00:27.853
BELLAMY'S DEAD.

00:27.897 --> 00:30.073
I'M SORRY.

00:37.515 --> 00:38.908
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.692
IT'S OPERATIONAL.

00:40.736 --> 00:43.304
LITTLE GLITCHY,
BUT IT'S WORKING.

00:43.347 --> 00:46.002
AND I'M GOING TO BED.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.266
I HEARD ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.963
YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE
UP FOR THIS?

00:51.007 --> 00:53.618
I'M FINE, CHONA.
GET SOME REST.

00:53.662 --> 00:56.273
IS IT TRUE NO ONE'S
BEING PUNISHED?

00:56.317 --> 00:57.927
NOT EVEN FOR KILLING ANDERS?

00:57.970 --> 00:59.755
I DON'T KNOW THINK
THAT'S BEEN DETERMINED.

00:59.798 --> 01:02.192
BUT IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME,
GIVEN THEY CONTROL THE KEY.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.759
YOU KNOW WHAT I HEARD?

01:03.802 --> 01:05.891
I HEARD THE SHEPHERD
GAVE THEM HIS QUARTERS.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.415
THE KEY, CHONA.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.764
ONCE THE LAST WAR
BEGINS,

01:08.807 --> 01:10.374
NONE OF THIS
WILL MATTER.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.463
WHO CARES ABOUT
HIS DAMN QUARTERS?

01:12.507 --> 01:14.248
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.511
THE SUBJECT IS READY
FOR NEURAL LINK.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.208
HE SHOWS SYMPTOMS
OF POST TRAUMATIC STRESS

01:18.252 --> 01:20.036
FROM THE EXPLOSION
IN THE STONE ROOM.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.646
FOR ALL MANKIND.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.431
FOR ALL MANKIND.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.232
LET'S BEGIN, SHALL WE?

01:42.276 --> 01:43.755
YOU'RE IN A VAST DESERT.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.627
THERE'S AN INSECT BUZZING
IN YOUR EAR.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.499
OCTAVIA: NO, THAT'S OK.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.762
I CAN'T LET YOU DIE
TO SAVE ME.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.721
JUMP THROUGH.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.157
THAT WAS FAST.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.506
I'LL BE OK.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.160
THE NEURAL LINK
IS ENGAGED.

01:57.204 --> 02:00.468
BELLAMY: NO WAY.
NOT WITHOUT YOU.

02:00.511 --> 02:02.774
MAN: FOR ALL MANKIND.
OCTAVIA: BELLAMY, GET DOWN!

02:05.951 --> 02:07.649
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

02:34.850 --> 02:36.808
HE'S ALIVE.

03:59.456 --> 04:02.590
UHH!

04:21.435 --> 04:23.088
UHH!

04:24.699 --> 04:26.048
UHH!

04:26.091 --> 04:27.354
AAH!

04:27.397 --> 04:30.444
UHH! UHH!

06:19.291 --> 06:21.163
- WAIT.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.600
STOP. STOP.

06:30.302 --> 06:32.696
IN THE LIGHT OF THE
SHEPHERD FOR ALL MANKIND.

06:32.740 --> 06:33.871
HE SAVED US.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.221
NO ONE IS COMING
TO SAVE US.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.963
YOUR FRIENDS ON BARDO
PROBABLY THINK WE'RE DEAD,
WHICH MEANS--

06:39.007 --> 06:41.183
DISCIPLES DIED AT YOUR HAND.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.838
IN THE LIGHT
OF THE SHEPHERD
FOR ALL MANKIND.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.188
- HE SAVED US.
- OK, THAT'S ENOUGH.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.494
YES, HE WILL SAVE US.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.234
I WILL FIGHT
ON HIS BEHALF.

06:49.278 --> 06:50.758
THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH. HEY.

06:50.801 --> 06:53.717
- HEY, HEY.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.066
UHH!

06:55.110 --> 06:57.155
STOP.

06:57.199 --> 07:00.202
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

07:00.245 --> 07:02.683
WE SURVIVE.
BOTH OF US.

07:02.726 --> 07:05.642
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY
TO LEAVE YOU HERE

07:05.686 --> 07:07.122
TO DIE OF YOUR WOUNDS,

07:07.165 --> 07:09.472
BUT THERE IS A WAY
OFF THIS PLANET.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.910
AND TO DO IT, IT'S
GONNA TAKE BOTH OF US

07:12.954 --> 07:15.130
WORKING TOGETHER.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.719
HEY. LIE BACK.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.285
LIE BACK.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.939
YOUR LEG'S PRETTY
MESSED UP.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.739
THIS IS GONNA HURT.

07:58.782 --> 08:01.306
AHH!

08:02.699 --> 08:05.572
THIS NEXT PART IS GONNA
HURT EVEN MORE.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.530
AND I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR HELP.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.184
IF YOU WANT TO WALK AGAIN,

08:09.227 --> 08:10.577
WE NEED TO GET
THIS BONE ALIGNED.

08:10.620 --> 08:11.882
OH, SWEET SHEPHERD.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.318
HE'S NOT HERE.
I'M ALL YOU GOT.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.146
ON 3, WITH YOUR GOOD FOOT,

08:15.190 --> 08:16.887
PUSH AS HARD AS YOU CAN
AGAINST THE WALL.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.933
THERE'S TREES IN
THE FOREST, LIMBS.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.978
YOU COULD JUST MAKE
A SPLINT, BIND THE LEG.

08:21.022 --> 08:23.459
SHUT UP.
BITE DOWN HARD.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.070
1, 2, 3.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.125
TOLD YOU THAT
WAS GONNA HURT.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.143
I'D LIKE TO GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE WE FIND OUT

08:55.186 --> 08:57.449
WHAT THESE EGGS
GROW INTO.

09:11.289 --> 09:14.118
SHOULD BE
BOILING SOON.

09:14.162 --> 09:16.425
IF YOU PULL THROUGH,

09:16.468 --> 09:18.949
WE'LL HAVE A GUY
NAMED PIKE TO THANK.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.386
AMONG OTHER THINGS,
HE TAUGHT US

09:21.430 --> 09:25.129
THAT THE OOZING SAP
FROM PINE TREES ON EARTH

09:25.173 --> 09:28.611
CAN MAKE ANTISEPTICS,
FIGHT INFECTION,

09:28.655 --> 09:30.744
AND HEAL WOUNDS.

09:34.138 --> 09:36.793
LET'S HOPE THE SAME GOES
FOR THE TREES ON THIS PLANET.

09:53.636 --> 09:56.117
BELLAMY: YOU'RE A BRILLIANT
CONVERSATIONALIST.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.553
I'M STUCK HERE WITH YOU,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.120
AND EVERYONE I LOVE--

09:59.163 --> 10:03.167
OCTAVIA, ECHO, CLARKE--

10:03.211 --> 10:04.647
THEY'RE ALL ALIVE.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.997
THEY'RE JUST OUT OF REACH.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.348
PROBLEM IS,

10:10.392 --> 10:13.917
TO GET BACK TO THE PEOPLE
I CARE ABOUT,

10:13.961 --> 10:18.139
I HAVE TO NURSE MY ENEMY
BACK TO HEALTH.

10:18.182 --> 10:23.623
SOMETIMES, BELLAMY BLAKE,
IRONY CAN BE FUNNY.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.626
THIS IS NOT
ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.857
NO, SIR.

10:40.901 --> 10:44.165
NEVER TRAVELS TO ANOTHER PLANET
WITHOUT SOMETHING TO READ.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.777
EVEN IF IT IS
POCKET PROPAGANDA

10:47.821 --> 10:50.432
FROM ANOTHER FALSE GOD.

11:37.044 --> 11:40.221
THEY DON'T SAY "THANK YOU"
WHERE YOU'RE FROM?

11:40.264 --> 11:43.224
BY ALL MEANS,
THANK YOU

11:43.267 --> 11:47.750
FOR CARING ABOUT YOURSELF
ENOUGH TO SAVE ME.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.579
SO IS THIS IT?

11:50.622 --> 11:52.842
IS THIS THE CAVE
OF ASCENT?

11:54.452 --> 11:56.498
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT?

11:56.541 --> 11:58.543
I READ IT.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.807
SURE, IT HELPED
PASS THE HOURS,

12:00.850 --> 12:05.202
BUT I GOT TO SAY,
THE MESSAGE...

12:05.246 --> 12:07.248
DOESN'T ADD UP.

12:10.033 --> 12:13.776
I'VE READ THESE WORDS
MORE TIMES THAN
YOU CAN IMAGINE.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.778
ENLIGHTEN ME.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.868
IT'S SIMPLE.
THE SHEPHERD BELIEVES
IN TRANSCENDENCE

12:18.912 --> 12:20.696
AND PEACE, RIGHT?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.394
BUT TO GET THERE,
IN ORDER TO REACH
THE NEXT STEP UP,

12:23.438 --> 12:25.135
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT A WAR.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.921
ELUCIDATION OF THAT
PARADOX IS NOT
OURS TO KNOW.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.271
OUR PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN AT WAR

12:30.314 --> 12:31.794
MORE TIMES THAN
YOU CAN KNOW,

12:31.838 --> 12:33.709
AND LET ME TELL YOU,
IT DOESN'T BRING PEACE,

12:33.753 --> 12:35.798
JUST DEATH AND PAIN

12:35.842 --> 12:37.844
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY
ENOUGH TO SURVIVE,

12:37.887 --> 12:39.323
ANOTHER WAR.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.499
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.632
YOUR BELIEFS,

12:43.675 --> 12:45.808
THEY'RE ALL ABOUT YOU.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.158
YOUR PEOPLE,
YOUR SISTER,

12:48.202 --> 12:51.553
THE LIVES YOU TAKE
TO PROTECT THEM.

12:51.596 --> 12:54.904
YOUR SELFISH VIEW
OF THE UNIVERSE
MAKES ME SICK.

12:54.948 --> 12:58.212
SO DON'T CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.909
THAT'S YOUR SOLUTION?

12:59.953 --> 13:01.998
THE SHEPHERD TEACHES
US WE'RE TINY

13:02.042 --> 13:04.871
IN COMPARISON
TO THE UNIVERSE.

13:04.914 --> 13:07.177
AND WHEN THE TIME COMES,

13:07.221 --> 13:09.310
HE WILL GUIDE ME HOME.

13:09.353 --> 13:12.269
OK, I GOT SOME NEWS
FOR YOU, CONDUCTOR DOUCETTE.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.793
IT IS THROUGH
NO HIGHER POWER

13:13.836 --> 13:15.185
THAT YOU ARE ALIVE
RIGHT NOW.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.057
IT IS THROUGH ME.
IT IS BECAUSE OF ME.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.667
YEAH. YOU. YOU.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.364
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.584
HA!

13:22.627 --> 13:24.804
YOU SAW THE WORDS.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.677
YOU DIDN'T
TRULY READ THIS.

13:32.072 --> 13:36.032
IN THE SHADOW OF
THE SHEPHERD FOR
ALL MANKIND.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.904
DO THAT LATER.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.820
IT'S TIME TO GET THAT LEG
OF YOURS STRONGER.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.660
IT'S ONLY BEEN A WEEK.
ANY PAIN?

14:01.928 --> 14:03.973
QUIT SHOWING OFF.

14:04.017 --> 14:05.801
HELP ME PACK
FOR THE CLIMB.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.897
SLOW DOWN.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.204
WEAR YOURSELF OUT
BEFORE THE ACTUAL CLIMB.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.510
I HAVE PEOPLE I HAVE
TO GET BACK TO.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.078
THE WALL OF
UNANSWERED PRAYERS.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.167
THE SHEPHERD'S
FIRST HURDLE.

14:24.211 --> 14:27.257
THERE'S NO WALKING
AROUND IT.

14:27.301 --> 14:30.391
YEAH. I KNEW THAT.

14:30.434 --> 14:31.914
HERE'S THE PLAN.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.655
BRACE YOUR BACK
AGAINST THE SHELF.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.439
I STAND ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.137
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO
REACH THAT HANDLE,
AND FROM THERE--

14:37.180 --> 14:38.878
I SHOULD GO FIRST.
I'LL HOIST YOU UP.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.532
MY LEG CAN BEAR MY WEIGHT,
NOT THE BOTH OF US.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.752
IT'S WEAKER THAN MY ARMS.

14:43.795 --> 14:46.276
MY ARMS WILL GET ME
OVER THE LEDGE, AND
THEN I'LL HELP YOU UP.

14:51.716 --> 14:54.067
FINE.

15:07.645 --> 15:10.431
BELLAMY: BE CAREFUL.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.928
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.973
THROW DOWN THE ROPE.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.806
THE ROPE!

15:49.557 --> 15:51.515
HAVE SOME FAITH.

16:08.228 --> 16:11.318
WE SHOULD BE
CLOSE NOW.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.020
BELLAMY: WOULD HAVE
BEEN A LITTLE EASIER

16:18.064 --> 16:19.587
IF WE HAD SOME OF
THE CLIMBING GEAR

16:19.630 --> 16:22.633
YOUR SHEPHERD BROUGHT
ALONG WITH HIM.

16:22.677 --> 16:25.985
IT'S TRUE THE
SHEPHERD PREPARED
FOR HIS PILGRIMAGE.

16:26.028 --> 16:29.292
TO EXPLORE THE
UNIVERSE HE HAD TO.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.815
BUT IT WAS HERE
ON ETHEREA

16:30.859 --> 16:32.992
THAT HE FOUND WHAT
HE WAS SEEKING--

16:33.035 --> 16:35.951
THE REMNANTS OF
THE CIVILIZATION THAT
HAD TRULY TRANSCENDED.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.997
AND WE'RE BACK TO THIS.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.827
WE'RE ON A PILGRIMAGE
OF OUR OWN.

16:42.871 --> 16:45.004
YOU MAY BE.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.962
I'M HEADED FOR THE EXIT.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.095
BUT THE SHEPHERD
GUIDES US BOTH.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.581
YOU SURE YOUR SHEPHERD
ISN'T LAUGHING AT US?

17:11.204 --> 17:17.645
AND SO THE SHEPHERD
PERSEVERED,

17:17.688 --> 17:20.300
CLIMBING SKYWARD

17:20.343 --> 17:23.781
FROM WHERE THE WORLD
BELOW APPEARED
AS NOTHINGNESS.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.696
LET ME GUESS.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.047
HE WAS ROLLING
A BOULDER UPHILL?

17:28.090 --> 17:31.267
NO, NO, WAIT.
I KNOW.

17:31.311 --> 17:34.009
HE WAS WEARING WAX WINGS
AND GOING FOR THE SUN.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.316
CHOOSE TO BELIEVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.709
THE SHEPHERD WAS HERE.

17:38.753 --> 17:41.321
HE WROTE OF
THE HARDSHIPS,

17:41.364 --> 17:44.063
THE KILLING COLD
OF NIGHTS,

17:44.106 --> 17:46.804
THE SNOW THAT
RAGED FOR MONTHS.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.763
THEY'RE WORDS
ON A PAGE.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.808
I MEAN, THIS...

17:50.852 --> 17:53.289
WE'VE CLIMBED LONG ENOUGH
TO KNOW WE CAN OUTRUN THIS.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.552
WE CAN'T OUTRUN THAT.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.125
SO HOW'D YOUR SHEPHERD
DEAL WITH IT?

18:03.169 --> 18:04.431
PRAY IT ALL AWAY?

18:04.474 --> 18:06.520
HE SOUGHT SHELTER
WHEN HE NEEDED IT.

18:06.563 --> 18:07.825
AND SO SHOULD WE.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.871
WE'RE RUNNING LOW
ON RATIONS NOW.

18:09.914 --> 18:12.613
I'M SURE AS HELL
NOT GONNA WASTE THEM

18:12.656 --> 18:14.832
SEARCHING
FOR A WIND BREAK.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.965
THE SHEPHERD'S PATIENCE
SHOULD BE OUR EXAMPLE.

18:17.008 --> 18:20.229
THE SNOW WILL STOP
ONCE WE CLEAR THE CLOUDS.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.885
THE TREES ARE
GETTING THINNER.

18:23.928 --> 18:26.061
IT'S ONLY
GETTING STEEPER.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.368
YOU KEEP GOING UP,
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.

18:28.411 --> 18:33.329
WELL, AT LEAST I WON'T
HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT
THE SHEPHERD ANYMORE.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.178
I'M NOT AFRAID.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.049
I'M NOT
AFRAID.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.704
OHH!

19:02.924 --> 19:05.274
NOT AFRAID.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.667
I'M NOT AFRAID.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.278
AHH.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.021
UHH.

19:25.816 --> 19:28.297
I'M NOT AFRAID.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.131
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

20:20.175 --> 20:22.438
SHELTER.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.875
A CAVE.
THIS ONE'S BIGGER
THAN THE FIRST ONE.

20:26.442 --> 20:30.229
YOU DIDN'T GO IN?

20:32.274 --> 20:35.538
NO. WHEN I FOUND IT,
I CAME BACK FOR YOU.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.590
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
THEY DON'T SAY

20:43.633 --> 20:44.895
"THANK YOU"
WHERE YOU'RE FROM?

20:44.939 --> 20:46.549
LET'S JUST CALL IT EVEN,

20:46.593 --> 20:48.725
LEAVE IT AT THAT.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.696
UHH. TRY AND
START A FIRE.

21:02.739 --> 21:05.220
HOW THE HELL DID
ALL THIS GET HERE?

21:32.073 --> 21:33.683
BELLAMY: FIRE.

21:33.727 --> 21:36.338
THAT WAS QUICK.
GOOD EARTH SKILLS.

21:36.382 --> 21:39.254
I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING YET.

22:09.893 --> 22:12.374
THE CAVE OF ASCENT.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.559
WITH HIS OWN LIFE

22:23.603 --> 22:26.388
HE SAW TESTAMENT
OF THOSE THAT ASCENDED

22:26.432 --> 22:29.478
AND HE KNEW HIS LIFE
WAS NOT IN VAIN.

22:34.135 --> 22:37.399
IN THE SHADOW
OF THE SHEPHERD
FOR ALL MANKIND,

22:37.443 --> 22:41.403
HE SAVED US FROM THE FIRE
THAT CONSUMED THE EARTH.

22:41.447 --> 22:44.058
IN THE LIGHT OF
THE SHEPHERD FOR ALL MANKIND,

22:44.101 --> 22:48.802
HE WILL SAVE US FROM
THE WAR TO END ALL WARS.

22:50.194 --> 22:51.674
HIS BEINGS ARE WITH
THE CIVILIZATION

22:51.718 --> 22:53.415
THAT ASCENDED,

22:53.459 --> 22:56.113
JUST AS THE SHEPHERD
FORETOLD.

22:56.157 --> 22:58.768
IMPRINTS OF THEIR ENERGY,

22:58.812 --> 23:01.554
THEIR MORTAL FORMS ARISEN.

23:07.473 --> 23:10.084
IN THE SACRED CAVE.

23:10.127 --> 23:12.086
NO.

23:12.129 --> 23:13.914
IN VIEW OF PROOF,

23:13.957 --> 23:16.046
YET STILL YOU DOUBT.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.096
NO. NO.

23:22.139 --> 23:24.446
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.122
IT'S BEEN DAYS.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.472
I KNOW THERE'S NO FOOD,
BUT THERE'S PLENTY
OF LICHEN ON THE WALL.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.213
YOU SHOULD EAT.

23:54.737 --> 23:58.088
THE SHEPHERD SURVIVED
3 MONTHS IN THIS CAVE,

23:58.132 --> 24:00.003
AND WE CAN, TOO.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.355
FROM THE ASHES,
WE WILL RISE.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.229
"FROM THE ASHES,
WE WILL RISE."

24:08.272 --> 24:10.492
LET ME SEE THAT
PICTURE AGAIN.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.940
THIS IS YOUR SHEPHERD?

24:23.984 --> 24:26.421
YES. I TOLD YOU.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.250
THIS GUY IS
A CULT LEADER.

24:29.293 --> 24:32.819
I SAW A VIDEO OF HIM
PREACHING ON EARTH.

24:32.862 --> 24:35.082
A FRAUD, A CONMAN.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.737
HE PREDICTED
THE EARTH'S END

24:37.780 --> 24:40.783
AND BROUGHT HIS PEOPLE
SAFELY ACROSS THE STARS.

24:40.827 --> 24:43.873
HE SPOKE OF THE BEINGS
IN THE CAVE,
OF THEIR ASCENSION.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.179
YOU SAW IT YOURSELF.

24:45.222 --> 24:47.007
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED HERE,

24:47.050 --> 24:49.400
BUT THOSE THINGS
DIDN'T ASCEND.

24:49.444 --> 24:52.186
THAT BOOK OF YOURS
SAYS THAT CIVILIZATION

24:52.229 --> 24:53.709
NEEDS TO HAVE
THE TECH KNOW-HOW,

24:53.753 --> 24:55.189
ENOUGH TO WORK
THE STONE,

24:55.232 --> 24:57.887
AND THOSE--THOSE
BEINGS OF LIGHT,

24:57.931 --> 24:59.802
THEY LIVED IN A CAVE.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.848
THEY'RE PURE.

25:03.589 --> 25:06.069
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT
TRANSCENDENCE IS BORN

25:06.113 --> 25:07.941
OF A CIVILIZATION'S CORE,

25:07.984 --> 25:09.508
ITS SOUL.

25:09.551 --> 25:14.164
ARE THEY PURE ENOUGH?
ARE THEY WORTHY?

25:14.208 --> 25:15.818
IF YOU DON'T TRUST
THE MESSENGER,

25:15.862 --> 25:17.167
THEN TRUST THE TRUTH
OF THE MESSAGE,

25:17.211 --> 25:18.604
THE BEINGS IN THE CAVE.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.781
YOU FELT IT.
I SAW IT IN YOUR EYES.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.394
I BELIEVE IN WHAT
I CAN PROVE.

25:26.437 --> 25:31.834
DO YOU LOVE YOUR FAMILY,
YOUR FRIENDS?

25:31.878 --> 25:33.619
WHAT KIND OF STUPID
QUESTION IS THAT?

25:33.662 --> 25:35.664
- YOU KNOW I DO.
- PROVE IT.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.450
AT LEAST THEY'RE
WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

25:39.494 --> 25:42.105
NOT JUST WORDS
IN SOME BOOK.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.760
MY PEOPLE, THAT IS
WHAT IS REAL.

25:44.804 --> 25:47.371
AND YET THERE'S
STILL SOMETHING
MISSING INSIDE YOU.

25:47.415 --> 25:51.071
DEATH AND DESPAIR
HOVER AROUND YOU

25:51.114 --> 25:53.595
LIKE A SHROUD,

25:53.639 --> 25:56.119
A CONSEQUENCE OF
YOUR SELFISH LOVE.

25:56.163 --> 25:58.165
PLEASE TELL ME AGAIN
HOW IT'S BETTER NOT TO LOVE.

25:58.208 --> 25:59.906
LOVE IS NOT THE PROBLEM.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.777
IT'S HOW YOU LOVE THAT IS.

26:01.821 --> 26:04.954
IT'S NOT FILLING
THE HOLE INSIDE YOU.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.869
I LOVE ALL PEOPLE
EQUALLY.

26:06.913 --> 26:09.829
I EVEN LOVE YOU,
A STRANGER.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.657
THAT'S WHY I CAME
BACK FOR YOU.

26:11.700 --> 26:15.617
I'M BEING TESTED
NOT TO PREFERENCE
THE FEW OVER THE MANY.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.620
I HAVE
A GREATER PURPOSE

26:18.664 --> 26:21.580
FOR ALL MANKIND.

26:25.496 --> 26:30.153
AHEM. WELL...
IF THOSE BEINGS OF LIGHT

26:30.197 --> 26:33.635
ARE WHAT'S WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE END OF YOUR RAINBOW,

26:33.679 --> 26:35.811
THEN GO IN AND BUNK
WITH THEM.

26:38.379 --> 26:42.339
BUT I'M STAYING HERE
ON MY SIDE.

27:05.319 --> 27:06.842
IN THE SHADOW
OF THE SHEPHERD

27:06.886 --> 27:08.235
FOR ALL MANKIND,

27:08.278 --> 27:09.758
HE SAVED US

27:09.802 --> 27:11.673
FROM THE FIRE THAT
CONSUMED THE EARTH.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.502
AND NO MAN...

27:14.545 --> 27:18.637
I LOST TRACK OF THE DAYS
AFTER THE FIRST TWO MONTHS.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.075
HOW LONG?

27:22.118 --> 27:23.511
HOW LONG HAVE
WE BEEN HERE?

27:23.554 --> 27:26.166
DOESN'T MATTER.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.951
WE'RE GONNA DIE
IN THIS CAVE.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.779
WHY DO YOU SEEM
SO HAPPY ABOUT IT?

27:30.823 --> 27:34.087
YOUR OBSESSION WITH YOUR
SISTER AND YOUR FRIENDS,

27:34.130 --> 27:37.612
IT'S WHAT DRIVES
THE DARKNESS THAT
MAKES YOU SUFFER.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.920
MY LOVE FOR ALL MANKIND,

27:40.963 --> 27:43.923
MY FAITH IN THE SHEPHERD,

27:43.966 --> 27:46.273
IT'S MADE ME LIGHTER
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.014
WHY IS THAT?

27:51.495 --> 27:55.586
YOU BELIEVE
IN THE SHEPHERD.

27:55.630 --> 27:58.111
WHAT DID THE SHEPHERD
BELIEVE IN?

27:58.154 --> 28:00.896
THE BOND THAT
UNITES US ALL,

28:00.940 --> 28:03.986
THAT WE'RE ALL CONNECTED.

28:04.030 --> 28:06.510
I CAN HELP SHOW YOU...

28:08.338 --> 28:10.253
IF YOU LIKE.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.524
I LIKE.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.791
SURE.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.320
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.544
DEEP BREATH IN.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.287
FEEL YOUR LUNGS EXPAND.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.945
IN THE SHADOW OF
THE SHEPHERD FOR
ALL MANKIND.

28:49.989 --> 28:53.209
HE SAVED...

28:53.253 --> 28:56.299
YOU'VE READ THE PASSAGE.

28:56.343 --> 28:59.607
YOU KNOW THE PRAYER.
COME ON, SAY IT WITH ME.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.786
BOTH: IN THE SHADOW OF
THE SHEPHERD FOR ALL MANKIND,

29:04.830 --> 29:08.529
HE SAVED US FROM FIRE
THAT CONSUMED THE EARTH.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.749
FROM THE LIGHT OF
THE SHEPHERD FROM ALL MANKIND,

29:10.792 --> 29:13.664
HE WILL SAVE US FROM
THE WAR TO END ALL WARS.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.841
IN THE SHADOW OF THE SHEPHERD
FOR ALL MANKIND,

29:15.884 --> 29:18.669
HE SAVED US FROM THE FIRE
THAT CONSUMED THE EARTH.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.976
BELLAMY: I DON'T THINK
THIS IS GONNA WORK.

29:36.122 --> 29:38.559
BELLAMY.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.343
HELLO.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.305
COME.
FOLLOW ME.

29:51.746 --> 29:54.270
I'VE ALREADY SEEN
WHAT'S IN THERE.

29:56.229 --> 29:59.232
HAVE YOU?

29:59.275 --> 30:04.193
THESE THINGS THAT YOU
THINK CAN SAVE YOU

30:04.237 --> 30:07.544
ARE JUST PIECES OF METAL.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.416
FAITH IS
THE TRUE WEAPON.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.114
YOU'VE COME FAR,
BELLAMY.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.987
YOUR EYES ARE OPENING.

30:15.030 --> 30:18.033
BUT THERE'S STILL
SO MUCH MORE TO SEE.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.706
BELLAMY: MOM.

30:51.588 --> 30:53.677
MY SON.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.913
GO TO THE LIGHT,
BELLAMY.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.307
THE LIGHT IS THE WAY.

31:34.675 --> 31:37.112
AHH...

31:45.555 --> 31:46.992
THE FIRST TIME
YOU CHOSE TO PRAY

31:47.035 --> 31:48.776
AND THE STORM BROKE.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.430
HEH HEH!

31:51.910 --> 31:54.913
IT MEANS WE'RE WORTHY,
I THINK.

31:54.956 --> 31:57.176
BOTH OF US.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.546
THE SUN'S GOING DOWN.

32:19.589 --> 32:22.288
WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT
UP THERE BEFORE DARK.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.726
WE SHOULD GO BACK.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.815
WE COULD GO BACK,

32:27.858 --> 32:30.861
BUT IT TOOK US THIS LONG
TO GET HERE FROM THE CAVE.

32:30.905 --> 32:33.690
TOMORROW, THE NEXT DAY,
NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE THAT.

32:33.734 --> 32:35.214
IF WE'RE ON THAT FACE
WHEN NIGHT FALLS,

32:35.257 --> 32:36.215
WE'LL FREEZE THERE.

32:36.258 --> 32:37.912
WE MAY.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.696
BUT THE DAYS ARE
GETTING SHORTER.

32:39.740 --> 32:43.657
THIS IS OUR BEST CHANCE.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.833
OUR ONLY CHANCE.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.317
HAVE SOME FAITH.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.605
GETTING CLOSER.

33:29.137 --> 33:31.531
GAH!

33:58.732 --> 34:00.386
AAH!

34:01.517 --> 34:04.042
NO! UHH!

34:06.696 --> 34:08.002
BELLAMY!

34:09.177 --> 34:10.744
I CAN'T.

34:10.787 --> 34:13.094
THERE'S NOTHING...

34:20.014 --> 34:22.321
- CUT ME LOOSE.
- NO.

34:22.364 --> 34:24.714
LOOK AT ME.
DOUCETTE, LOOK AT ME.

34:24.758 --> 34:26.803
I SLIPPED THE BOOK
IN YOUR PROVISION BAG.

34:26.847 --> 34:27.804
WHAT?

34:27.848 --> 34:29.110
THE SHEPHERD'S BOOK.

34:29.154 --> 34:30.720
I WROTE THE
STONE CODES INSIDE.

34:30.764 --> 34:32.592
YOU CAN ACTIVATE
THE STONE YOURSELF.

34:32.635 --> 34:34.855
NOW CUT ME LOOSE,
OR WE'LL BOTH DIE!

34:34.898 --> 34:37.858
NO. WE'RE DOING
THIS TOGETHER.

34:44.865 --> 34:48.129
FROM THE LIGHT
OF THE SHEPHERD...

34:48.173 --> 34:49.913
FOR ALL MANKIND...

34:51.741 --> 34:54.266
HE SAVED US FROM THE FIRE
THAT CONSUMED THE EARTH.

34:56.659 --> 34:59.967
BOTH: AND NOW,
INSPIRED BY HIS STRENGTH,

35:00.010 --> 35:03.188
I SEARCH FOR RESILIENCE
AND THE WILL

35:03.231 --> 35:05.842
TO FIND A WAY.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.504
FOR ALL MANKIND.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.694
YOU COULD HAVE DIED.

35:34.436 --> 35:38.310
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
I PLAN ON GETTING
OFF THIS PLANET.

36:11.038 --> 36:13.693
IN THE LIGHT
OF THE SHEPHERD.

36:16.043 --> 36:17.871
WE'RE HERE.

37:06.615 --> 37:09.531
I DON'T...
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:09.575 --> 37:10.880
WHAT NOW?

37:10.924 --> 37:12.926
NOW WE DO WHAT
WE CAME TO DO.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.191
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE THAT
THE BRIDGE IS DOWN THERE?

37:17.235 --> 37:19.193
THIS IS THE PATH
OF THE SHEPHERD,

37:19.237 --> 37:23.676
AND IN HIS LIGHT,
WE WILL NOT LOSE.

37:30.291 --> 37:33.642
DOUCETTE!

37:48.701 --> 37:50.659
I AM AFRAID.

37:58.754 --> 38:03.019
AAH!

38:03.063 --> 38:05.935
AAH!

38:05.979 --> 38:08.503
UHH! UHH!

38:19.079 --> 38:20.428
HEH.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.611
TALK ABOUT
A LEAP OF FAITH.

38:29.655 --> 38:33.136
SHEPHERD:
WELCOME BACK, BELLAMY.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.801
MY SHEPHERD.

38:51.764 --> 38:52.982
PLEASE STAND.

38:55.463 --> 38:57.335
AND CALL ME BILL.

38:59.989 --> 39:02.905
PILGRIMS RETURN
FROM ETHEREA.

39:02.949 --> 39:04.864
I WANT TO KNOW
EVERYTHING.

39:04.907 --> 39:07.562
BUT FIRST,
YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.651
AND I'M AFRAID THEY'VE
GOTTEN THEMSELVES

39:09.695 --> 39:11.349
INTO SOME TROUBLE.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.832
THANK GOD
FOR THE FLAME.

39:19.487 --> 39:22.664
DOUBT THEY BE SERVE US
SAJI BOWLS IN JAIL.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.797
HOW COULD YOU
EAT RIGHT NOW?

39:24.840 --> 39:26.538
HE CAN ALWAYS EAT.

39:26.581 --> 39:28.104
GABRIEL'S RIGHT.

39:28.148 --> 39:29.628
IF THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE
I HAD THE FLAME,

39:29.671 --> 39:31.369
WE'D BE IN CELLS.

39:31.412 --> 39:33.066
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?

39:33.109 --> 39:35.547
TO WAKE THE OTHERS.

39:35.590 --> 39:37.375
IT'S TIME TO GO
BACK TO SANCTUM.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.115
CLARKE, WE'RE
UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

39:39.159 --> 39:40.856
I'M AWARE
OF THAT.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.815
I'M ALSO AWARE
OUR LEVERAGE

39:42.858 --> 39:45.557
DISAPPEARS THE
MOMENT HE PUTS ME IN
FRONT OF THAT STONE.

39:46.819 --> 39:49.212
HOPE: SO WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO?

39:49.256 --> 39:51.258
I'M GONNA
OFFER TO DO IT

39:51.301 --> 39:53.391
AS SOON AS THE REST
OF YOU ARE SAFELY
BACK ON SANCTUM.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.741
CLARKE,
THEY'LL KILL YOU.

39:55.784 --> 39:58.221
YOU ARE NOT SACRIFICING
YOURSELF FOR US.

40:00.223 --> 40:02.225
MAN: MAKE WAY
FOR THE SHEPHERD.

40:06.055 --> 40:07.230
WE NEED TO TALK.

40:07.274 --> 40:09.232
I'M READY
TO HELP YOU.

40:09.276 --> 40:12.453
BUT ONLY AFTER
MY FRIENDS ARE...

40:27.903 --> 40:29.427
BELLAMY?

40:41.177 --> 40:43.876
HOW?

40:43.919 --> 40:45.878
WE SAW YOU DIE.

40:48.228 --> 40:51.884
IT'S HARD TO KEEP
THE BLAKES DOWN.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.976
SHEPHERD: HOLD.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.368
SHE HAS THE KEY.

41:01.589 --> 41:03.635
The key is the flame.

41:03.678 --> 41:05.419
They think it's
still in my head.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.247
Say nothing.

41:08.944 --> 41:11.991
SHEPHERD: I HOPE THAT NOW
YOU'RE READY TO HELP US, CLARKE.

41:12.034 --> 41:14.210
TOO MUCH BLOOD
HAS BEEN SPILLED.

41:14.254 --> 41:17.083
EACH DEATH IS A CHILD OF EARTH
WHO WON'T TRANSCEND.

41:17.126 --> 41:19.346
I'LL GIVE YOU TIME
TO REUNITE

41:19.389 --> 41:21.391
WHILE WE MAKE PREPARATIONS.

41:24.917 --> 41:27.006
MY SHEPHERD...

41:31.663 --> 41:33.926
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

41:33.969 --> 41:35.928
CLARKE DOESN'T
HAVE THE KEY.

41:35.971 --> 41:39.018
THE FLAME
WAS DESTROYED.

41:44.066 --> 41:48.066
I'M SORRY.
