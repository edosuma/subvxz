00:23.156 --> 00:25.886
Michael, we're locked
into a laser tracking system.

00:28.428 --> 00:32.762
A truckload of confiscated weapons
was stolen from a police warehouse.

00:32.832 --> 00:35.357
The weapons included
two laser rifles.

00:35.435 --> 00:38.165
I want to find out
if he really belongs here.

00:39.639 --> 00:42.904
There are truck tracks going
in. No truck tracks going out.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.638
Only one direction left.
Up?

00:47.614 --> 00:49.172
Go!

01:05.298 --> 01:06.390
Knight Rider.

01:06.466 --> 01:10.129
A shadowy flight into the
dangerous world of a man...

01:10.203 --> 01:12.262
who does not exist.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.174
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.248 --> 01:24.978
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:25.051 --> 01:26.848
the helpless, the powerless...

01:26.920 --> 01:30.356
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.147
Excuse me.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.654
Can I help you?

02:41.094 --> 02:43.289
I'm looking
for Capt. O'Mally.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.431
Sure.
If you have a pass.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.322
Yeah.

02:50.703 --> 02:52.295
I'll get it.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.744
Got it.

03:53.533 --> 03:54.522
We got them.

03:57.637 --> 03:58.626
Go. Go.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.016
Hey. Hey!

04:56.329 --> 04:58.320
Well, Michael,
we're almost home.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.357
Don't say that too loud.

05:00.433 --> 05:03.630
With any luck we'll get there
before Devon calls.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.432
He does seem to have
an uncanny knack in that area.

05:06.506 --> 05:10.499
"Uncanny" is one way of
putting it. Perverse is another.

05:10.743 --> 05:12.734
I wouldn't go that far,
Michael.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.108
Devon is calling.
Speak of the devil.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.374
I beg your pardon?

05:17.450 --> 05:20.442
Devon, it's just a figure
of speech. What's up?

05:20.553 --> 05:24.683
A truckload of confiscated weapons
was stolen from a police warehouse.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.223
The weapons included
dozens of...

05:27.293 --> 05:31.593
H and K 9mm automatics
and two laser rifles.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.197
Laser rifles?

05:33.399 --> 05:36.891
Devon, in the wrong hands they
could create a lot of problems.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.095
Precisely.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.196
You said they were stolen
from the police warehouse.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.968
That makes it police business,
doesn't it?

05:42.041 --> 05:45.272
Ordinarily, yes. But one
of the thieves, a woman...

05:45.345 --> 05:48.337
had a pass issued by
a police captain, Tom O'Mally.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.210
Internal Affairs wants an
independent investigation.

05:51.284 --> 05:52.717
He's a survivalist.

05:53.252 --> 05:56.517
There's going to be a convention
at the Dune Drifter this weekend.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.317
Keep me posted, Michael.

05:58.424 --> 06:01.518
Yeah, I'll keep you posted.
Got you, though.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.390
You were right, Michael.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.993
Uncanny, isn't it?
I was thinking of "perverse. "

06:18.578 --> 06:21.479
Paging Mr. Ewing.
Front desk, please.

06:25.351 --> 06:26.875
Here you are, Mr. Knight.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.220
Mr. Knight.
Oh.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.153
Here you are.
Suite 37.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.752
The Mirrored Grotto.
Mirrored Grotto.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.954
Sounds perfect. Your basic
survival suite, huh?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.490
Listen, I'm looking
for an old buddy of mine.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.294
His name is O'Mally.
Tom O'Mally.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.595
He check in yet?

06:42.668 --> 06:44.192
Yes, he certainly has.

06:44.303 --> 06:46.294
He's quite a character.
Yeah, I know.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.498
Any idea where
he's hunting today?

06:49.275 --> 06:50.708
Try the banquet hall.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.902
The automatic
weapons display.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.274
Her name's Sheila.
Thank you.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.427
Quite a display,
isn't it, gentlemen?

07:19.806 --> 07:21.774
You could say that again,
sweet cakes.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.005
As you can see, the...

07:30.216 --> 07:32.047
HK MP5...

07:32.118 --> 07:34.586
is a fully automatic weapon.

07:34.687 --> 07:37.656
That oozes
more firepower per dollar...

07:37.723 --> 07:41.352
than any other automatic
assault rifle in the world today.

07:41.494 --> 07:43.962
Say that again,
"oozes."

07:48.801 --> 07:52.498
Well, if there aren't any questions,
I guess we'll break for lunch.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.630
Thank you
for your interest.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.582
Excuse me, Sheila.
I'd like to ask you something.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.882
To tell you the truth, I really
don't know anything about guns.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.752
I mean, last show
I worked I...

08:10.823 --> 08:14.486
washed my hair 25 times a day
for a shampoo convention.

08:14.727 --> 08:17.355
Next week it could be Bibles. Who knows?

08:17.430 --> 08:18.829
I see what you mean.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.866
Actually, I'm trying to find a
guy with the name of Tom O'Mally.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.801
Some of the guys back there
said that you might know him.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.031
Oh, yeah, Tom.

08:26.138 --> 08:27.901
Everybody knows him.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.802
At least all the girls.
He's quite a character.

08:30.877 --> 08:32.071
So I hear.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.840
Any idea
where I could find him?

08:37.783 --> 08:38.807
Hey!

08:44.590 --> 08:47.081
Don't worry.
It's only a game.

08:47.159 --> 08:49.821
A game? He's bleeding.
No, no, no. That's only paint.

08:49.996 --> 08:52.191
Ever hear of
the East Orange Ambush Club?

08:55.301 --> 08:57.360
They're in a war
with Ventura County.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.267
Whenever one member
spots another...

08:59.338 --> 09:01.863
it's draw and fire.
No questions asked.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.571
Nice pistol you got there.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.134
Yeah, it is.

09:06.312 --> 09:07.779
9mm.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.711
Good and handy.
Good balance.

09:09.849 --> 09:12.409
That's what I hear.
Mind if I take a look?

09:12.485 --> 09:14.885
Go ahead.
Thank you.

09:15.621 --> 09:17.816
It's nice.
It's real nice.

09:18.024 --> 09:21.016
I'd sure like to get one of
these. Where'd you buy yours?

09:21.093 --> 09:23.618
Bought it from her.
That girl who was here.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.155
Was?

09:26.732 --> 09:29.792
You gotta keep them on a
leash these days. Yeah, here.

09:29.869 --> 09:32.337
Come on, I think I owe
you a beer. You got it.

09:32.672 --> 09:37.302
KITT, give me a check
on serial number XJ73726.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.474
It's one of the weapons stolen
from the police warehouse.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.042
Thanks, pal.

09:43.282 --> 09:44.806
You got to be kidding.

09:44.884 --> 09:47.614
Kidding?
Do I look like I'm kidding?

09:48.120 --> 09:50.953
Sheila, selling stolen
property is a felony.

09:51.023 --> 09:54.083
People do time for felonies.
Serious time.

09:54.660 --> 09:55.752
Felony?

09:56.128 --> 09:58.596
Gosh, you make it
sound so serious.

09:58.664 --> 10:02.430
It is serious. Those pistols were
stolen from a police warehouse.

10:02.702 --> 10:05.603
I didn't steal anything.
I swear.

10:05.705 --> 10:06.763
Hey...

10:06.839 --> 10:08.704
do I look like
a thief to you?

10:09.241 --> 10:11.607
I don't go by looks
and neither do the police.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.380
Now I'm gonna ask you again,
where'd you get that pistol?

10:16.349 --> 10:17.407
I found it.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.879
I did.
Don't look at me like that.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.887
I found a whole
bunch of them.

10:23.022 --> 10:24.114
Where?

10:24.256 --> 10:25.518
Okay.

10:25.858 --> 10:28.725
On my way here.
I was hitchhiking.

10:29.395 --> 10:32.831
And this guy, well,
he started to get fresh, so...

10:33.366 --> 10:35.061
so I started walking.

10:35.167 --> 10:38.659
I took a shortcut through these trees and
there was this big truck hidden in there.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.069
It was full of guns.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.730
Do you believe me?

10:42.541 --> 10:44.406
I'm working on it.

10:46.245 --> 10:48.577
You want to take me there?
Sure.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.273
Just let me change first.
No.

10:50.349 --> 10:54.183
Last time a woman in your spot told me
that, it took me three days to find her.

10:54.286 --> 10:57.221
Then you've been hanging out
with the wrong kind of people.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.220
I'm not that kind of girl.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.622
All right.
Five minutes.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.556
Mmm, ten.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.692
Ten.

11:32.792 --> 11:33.918
Oh, very funny.

11:35.394 --> 11:37.191
Well, you did it again.

11:37.263 --> 11:40.721
Keep out of this, Martha.
Let me handle it, will you?

11:42.334 --> 11:44.632
Oh, no.
Just what I don't need.

11:46.939 --> 11:47.928
Hey!

11:48.941 --> 11:51.842
Why don't you look
where you're going?

11:51.911 --> 11:53.640
I haven't moved an inch.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.605
I heard that.

11:55.781 --> 12:00.184
Everybody thinks just 'cause you're a
senior citizen your ears are gonna drop off.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.378
Not mine, buddy.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.479
I think I got whiplash!

12:03.556 --> 12:05.615
Whiplash my CPU.

12:05.691 --> 12:09.127
Hey, hey, hey. What's that?
You calling my wife names?

12:09.195 --> 12:11.060
What did he call me, Edgar?

12:11.130 --> 12:13.394
He's got a foul tongue,
sweetheart.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.661
Oh, dear.
Excuse me.

12:16.368 --> 12:17.528
Can I help you?

12:17.603 --> 12:20.663
Are you with this car? Yeah.
Yeah, I am. Is something wrong?

12:20.740 --> 12:24.904
You bet there's something
wrong. Your pal here just hit me.

12:24.977 --> 12:26.535
He hit you?

12:26.612 --> 12:29.080
I don't chew
my cabbage twice.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.882
Yeah, well, don't worry
about a thing. I'm insured.

12:31.951 --> 12:34.613
Yeah, well, I have heard
that one before.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.982
My name's Michael Knight.

12:36.055 --> 12:38.455
I'm registered here at the
hotel. I got to run a few errands.

12:38.524 --> 12:39.786
I'll be back
in just a little while.

12:39.859 --> 12:41.190
We'll straighten
everything out.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.386
Yes, well,
you better had...

12:42.461 --> 12:44.725
'cause I'm gonna take down
your license number, buddy.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.628
Help yourself.
Martha.

12:50.169 --> 12:52.160
Michael, that man is lying.

12:52.238 --> 12:53.364
Not now, KITT.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.340
Did you say something?
Clearing my throat.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.098
Yes.

13:10.222 --> 13:14.022
Never should have let him get away,
Edgar. Oh, will you hush up, please.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.562
N-I-G-H-T. Night.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.857
I got it.

13:21.567 --> 13:22.659
Okay.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.169
Turn right here. It should be
right down this road.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.068
You said that
three turns back.

13:27.139 --> 13:30.108
Well, I was walking then. Things
look different when you walk.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.306
There it is. It's right
between those trees.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.844
I did not strike
that man's car.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.009
Oh, not now, KITT.
Please, not now.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.050
Okay, this is
definitely it now.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.389
See, what did
I tell you?

13:46.091 --> 13:47.649
I don't believe this.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.404
Michael, I'm not lying.
That truck was here.

14:19.491 --> 14:21.186
Go! Get down! Get down!

14:46.318 --> 14:49.116
All right. Stay low.
Get in. Go on.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.448
All right, hit it.
I want that guy.

14:55.094 --> 14:58.757
I'm sorry, Michael. But he's on a back
road. We can't get there from here.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.028
You don't believe me.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.796
There are truck tracks going
in. No truck tracks going out.

15:06.872 --> 15:08.999
There's no hole where
the truck could be buried.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.507
No tracks to the left.

15:10.609 --> 15:11.940
To the right.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.205
Or down.

15:13.279 --> 15:14.803
Only one direction left.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.216
Up?
Up.

15:20.786 --> 15:22.344
Could have been
a helicopter.

15:24.556 --> 15:25.750
All right.

15:26.225 --> 15:29.092
Where's O'Mally?
Look, I told you.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.723
Hey, wait a minute.

15:31.196 --> 15:32.686
He did tell me...

15:32.765 --> 15:34.892
he would never miss
the shooting competition.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.457
All right.
Let's do it.

15:48.314 --> 15:49.804
You stay put.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.417
You're late.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.714
Father, when I look good,
I think good.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.914
I got the lasers for us,
didn't I?

15:59.692 --> 16:02.058
We wouldn't have a shot
at that platinum without them.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.822
Were you trying
to call my room?

16:03.896 --> 16:05.363
No, that was Rawleigh.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.763
Is he too drunk again to get rid of
the tire tracks that he was supposed to?

16:08.834 --> 16:12.361
No. There were a couple of people out
where the truck was. Nosing around.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.235
Police?

16:14.573 --> 16:16.837
One's a pitch girl
working the convention.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.275
The other one's a guy
that's looking for O'Mally.

16:19.378 --> 16:21.505
They're headed on back in.
Now look...

16:21.814 --> 16:23.338
we better stay put.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.349
Right here. Till tomorrow.
Till it's time.

16:26.452 --> 16:27.680
Father.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.653
The army
made you a worrier.

16:30.189 --> 16:34.182
The convention's a perfect cover
for our equipment and our practice.

16:34.259 --> 16:35.920
That's why we're here.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.052
I know, I know.
But what about those people?

16:38.163 --> 16:40.154
Whoever and whatever
they are...

16:40.265 --> 16:42.358
we're not going to let them
interfere with us.

16:42.434 --> 16:43.992
We'll check them out.

16:44.136 --> 16:46.764
But we're not going
to change our timetable.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.105
Reload for rapid fire.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.642
Everybody knows O'Mally
but nobody's seen him.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.412
And I looked everywhere. Not
everywhere or we'd have him.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.279
Just keep looking.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.345
Commence rapid fire.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.635
Now, let's see
if we can find Rawleigh.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.303
Yeah, all right.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.617
That's the end of round one.

17:43.128 --> 17:44.356
Excuse me.

17:44.963 --> 17:48.194
Nice weapon you're wearing
there. Isn't that a HK P7 9mm?

17:48.700 --> 17:50.600
Yeah, sure is.

17:50.869 --> 17:54.202
You really know your weapons,
mister... Knight. Michael Knight.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.798
My name is Jastrow.
Lyle Jastrow.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.370
Your friends are here.

17:59.445 --> 18:00.673
My what?

18:01.013 --> 18:03.880
The two that were nosing
around the truck before.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.140
The lady over there...

18:06.318 --> 18:08.809
and the guy
with the extra long pants...

18:08.887 --> 18:10.548
talking to your old man.

18:10.656 --> 18:14.319
Mind if I ask you something? Why
don't you ask and then I'll decide.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.586
Are you up here to involve
yourself in this convention...

18:16.662 --> 18:19.961
or are you one of those folks that's
come up here to point and snicker at us?

18:20.032 --> 18:22.557
Or maybe you're some reporter
who's looking to sell an article...

18:22.634 --> 18:24.761
about those
"weirdo survivalists?"

18:25.137 --> 18:27.401
Now calm down, Daddy.

18:28.874 --> 18:29.966
I'm Tyler.

18:31.577 --> 18:34.410
It's a very, very touchy
subject with him.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.209
I guess he couldn't
help noticing...

18:36.281 --> 18:38.681
that you're not exactly
dressed for the events.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.808
Oh, this?

18:40.018 --> 18:43.249
When I got in from LA I found
out my bags went to Honolulu.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.788
I didn't want to miss
any of this...

18:44.857 --> 18:47.826
so I met this little lady and
she said she'd show me around.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.654
You wouldn't happen to know a guy with
the name of Tom O'Mally, would you?

18:53.031 --> 18:54.055
No.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.829
He in the competition?
No, no, I checked.

18:58.737 --> 18:59.931
Are you?

19:00.272 --> 19:04.265
I would be, but my guns went the
way of my bags. I'm out of it now.

19:05.077 --> 19:09.036
Well, I just happen to have
a beautiful HK PSG1 sniper...

19:09.114 --> 19:10.809
that I could loan you.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.977
Oh, I appreciate that,
but I couldn't do that.

19:14.052 --> 19:15.076
Well...

19:15.154 --> 19:18.920
I don't know any man who's
really into guns who wouldn't.

19:24.196 --> 19:27.927
Well, in that case,
I'd love to fire a few rounds.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.297
KITT, I need some windage.

19:37.409 --> 19:40.401
Elevation calculations right
away. Give me some numbers.

19:40.479 --> 19:43.346
I detect a sense of urgency
in your voice, Michael.

19:44.316 --> 19:47.444
At that distance, Michael,
I'd try elevation up two...

19:47.519 --> 19:49.214
left windage, one klick.

19:49.288 --> 19:50.585
Thank you.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.955
Shooters, ready!

20:00.599 --> 20:02.157
Commence firing.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.901
Reload for rapid fire.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.010
Ladies and gentlemen, target
number one, Michael Knight.

20:17.916 --> 20:19.611
Three bull's-eyes!

20:24.122 --> 20:27.751
Ewing on target number two.
Two bull's-eyes.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.486
Three at ten.

20:30.329 --> 20:33.560
I played along with him when
he said the magic word, O'Mally.

20:34.566 --> 20:38.161
But you mind telling me why you
snookered him into the competition?

20:38.971 --> 20:42.372
'Cause it was his nose poking around
the grove where we hid the truck.

20:42.441 --> 20:45.433
I want to find out
if he really belongs here.

20:50.382 --> 20:52.043
Commence firing.

21:02.294 --> 21:04.228
Ladies and gentlemen...

21:04.529 --> 21:08.021
Mr. Michael Knight
on target number one.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.631
Ten in the bull's-eye.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.566
Shooters, ready the line
for pistol fire.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.044
Congratulations.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.782
You two really got along.
Thanks. Fine weapon.

21:30.856 --> 21:34.121
Smooth action
and beautifully finished.

21:34.893 --> 21:35.951
Well...

21:36.028 --> 21:39.725
it takes the sensitive hands and
coordination of a marksman to...

21:39.798 --> 21:41.095
really give it life.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.862
And some luck.
Nothing quite like that.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.493
How do I thank you?

21:45.871 --> 21:47.771
Say about 7:00.
In the lobby?

21:48.106 --> 21:50.802
I'll plan an itinerary.
I'll be there.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.177
Shooters, ready!

21:59.918 --> 22:01.886
Commence firing.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.307
Can I ask you a question?

22:24.376 --> 22:27.675
Those guns you found, you said
you sold only one, right?

22:27.746 --> 22:30.214
What's the difference what I
say? You don't believe me anyway.

22:30.282 --> 22:31.647
Sheila, it's important.

22:33.151 --> 22:35.085
I only sold that one. Honest.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.155
Okay, okay.
I had to be sure.

22:37.222 --> 22:39.417
And I keep answering
the same thing.

22:39.491 --> 22:41.618
Now why do you want
to know about the guns?

22:41.693 --> 22:45.459
Because Jastrow had one
on his hip. Same model.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.361
They're not all that common.
Oh.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.999
I thought it had something
to do with that girl.

22:51.069 --> 22:52.536
You know, the princess.

22:52.604 --> 22:56.040
You sure perked up when she granted
you the honor of her company tonight.

22:56.174 --> 22:59.109
Well, she was very attractive
and she was...

22:59.378 --> 23:01.243
very, very nice to me.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.338
So what am I,
chopped liver?

23:05.050 --> 23:07.075
You guys are all the same.

23:07.919 --> 23:10.979
You drive a jazzy custom car,
blow-dry your hair...

23:11.923 --> 23:13.948
and your eyes
never stop wandering.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.056
I just want a guy who...

23:18.430 --> 23:19.920
who's dependable...

23:21.633 --> 23:22.827
personable...

23:23.935 --> 23:27.098
and bankable.
Am I making myself clear?

23:27.172 --> 23:29.572
Look, Sheila, I think
they're called "husbands."

23:30.342 --> 23:32.242
Yeah, I think so, too.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.810
And that's why I keep moving
and keep looking.

23:36.214 --> 23:38.910
Sometimes my moves
are faster than my income.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.985
That's why I sold that gun.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.813
How much did you get
for the gun anyway?

23:45.323 --> 23:48.121
$80. I'm wearing it.
It's the blouse.

23:49.995 --> 23:51.724
And there goes my sermon.

24:20.725 --> 24:22.522
We did very well
at the competition...

24:22.594 --> 24:23.754
didn't we, Michael?

24:23.829 --> 24:25.626
Yes, we did, partner.

24:25.831 --> 24:27.355
Get me Devon, will you?

24:28.166 --> 24:32.193
Hello, Michael. I assume you're calling to
tell me that you've tracked down O'Mally.

24:33.004 --> 24:35.734
No. Why would you
assume that?

24:35.807 --> 24:38.002
Well, my data
clearly indicates that.

24:38.343 --> 24:39.901
Everyone knows O'Mally.

24:40.378 --> 24:43.040
Is it possible that you've
taken a wrong turn somewhere?

24:43.114 --> 24:44.809
No sir. This is the place.

24:44.883 --> 24:48.114
Someone here has seen the truck and
I've turned up two of those automatics.

24:48.186 --> 24:50.552
Good work, Michael.
And the lasers?

24:50.622 --> 24:52.715
Nothing yet on the lasers.
But, look, I got some ideas.

24:52.791 --> 24:56.283
Have Bonnie check out a man
named Jastrow. Lyle Jastrow.

24:56.361 --> 24:58.522
And his daughter named Tyler.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.360
Do both pertain to business
or just the father?

25:01.500 --> 25:04.799
I'm hoping you can tell me.
See you, Devon.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.269
KITT, you can help me, too.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.364
Keep your scanners peeled for Jastrow
while I'm checking out these events.

25:09.474 --> 25:11.704
Anything specific I should
be looking for Michael?

25:11.776 --> 25:15.735
No, but I got a feeling his daughter
cooked up this little itinerary...

25:15.814 --> 25:17.111
just to keep me busy.

25:21.219 --> 25:23.483
You're going to be
a lot busier than you think.

25:23.555 --> 25:25.489
No way, buddy.
I'm out of here.

25:31.229 --> 25:32.856
Oh, Martha. There it is!

25:32.931 --> 25:34.296
Is he in the car?

25:34.366 --> 25:36.664
I don't know, sweetheart.
We'll soon find out.

25:37.569 --> 25:39.730
Why don't I like the sound
of that?

25:47.746 --> 25:49.839
Let go of my door, please.

25:49.915 --> 25:52.645
Open up,
I got the estimate here.

25:53.184 --> 25:55.675
For what?
To fix my car.

25:57.589 --> 26:01.116
Calling that a car is
an insult to auto technology.

26:01.393 --> 26:05.056
Listen, friend, you hit me,
and you're gonna pay for it.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.225
Replace...

26:08.466 --> 26:10.661
rear cracked window.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.398
Repair dings.
Recover the roof.

26:14.773 --> 26:16.741
Right front fender.

26:16.942 --> 26:18.569
Replace bumper.

26:19.110 --> 26:20.975
Trunk lid.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.274
Wheels covers,
prime and paint.

26:25.550 --> 26:28.678
$4,681.

26:29.754 --> 26:33.656
You'll have to forward your bill to
The Foundation for Law and Government.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.989
"Law and Government"?
Right.

26:37.195 --> 26:39.322
Don't let him bluff you,
Edgar.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.895
Get in the car, Martha.
Come on.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.967
Yeah, KITT, I'm in the lobby.
Keep it low.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.838
Jastrow and another man
are leaving the hotel.

26:51.977 --> 26:53.911
Keep them located.
I'm on my way.

26:53.979 --> 26:56.743
Michael, you have an
appointment with Tyler Jastrow.

26:56.982 --> 27:00.042
Yeah, I know. Her timing is all
too convenient. Stall her. Will you?

27:00.118 --> 27:01.210
How?

27:01.286 --> 27:04.653
She's on the fifth floor. I don't
think she likes to walk the stairs.

27:29.347 --> 27:31.338
We're almost there, Michael.

27:33.752 --> 27:37.051
I've pinpointed the Land Rover
behind the hill on our right, Michael.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.611
Keep an eye on me,
will you, pal?

28:52.831 --> 28:54.696
It's a laser, partner.
You see that?

28:55.100 --> 28:57.068
Yes. According to my data...

28:57.135 --> 28:59.535
it uses a highly advanced
mega laser.

28:59.604 --> 29:01.663
They'll pop through steel
the same way.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.898
Well, I'm going to use it on
Rawleigh if he doesn't show up soon.

29:04.976 --> 29:07.638
I told him where and when but he's
always late. What's his problem?

29:07.712 --> 29:08.872
Booze.

29:17.889 --> 29:20.187
Michael,
there's a vehicle approaching.

29:20.558 --> 29:22.423
Jastrow! You got company!

29:28.066 --> 29:30.796
He's running down the hill
behind you. Cut him off.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.715
KITT. I need you.

29:47.418 --> 29:48.942
Right away, Michael.

30:33.364 --> 30:34.524
Good work, buddy.

30:34.599 --> 30:37.033
Now let's give them
a taste of their own.

30:37.101 --> 30:38.534
Say no more, Michael.

30:53.318 --> 30:54.876
Well done, Michael.

30:55.286 --> 30:57.151
Fletcher,
hit him with the laser!

30:59.190 --> 31:01.681
Michael, we're locked into
a laser tracking system.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.957
Let's get out of here!

31:18.076 --> 31:20.408
Michael, they've knocked out
my scanner.

31:20.478 --> 31:22.969
All right, let's see
how bad things are.

31:28.519 --> 31:31.283
Other than the scanner, it
doesn't appear to be too serious.

31:31.356 --> 31:34.348
Easy for you to say. Surely you
don't plan another confrontation.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.154
Oh, yes, I do.

31:36.327 --> 31:38.295
Please, Michael.
But not today.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.788
Get me Bonnie.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.425
KITT, does that feel better?

31:44.502 --> 31:46.800
I feel like a new vehicle,
Bonnie. Thank you.

31:46.871 --> 31:49.362
Did you find anything out
there besides the laser guns?

31:49.440 --> 31:52.102
Unless I miss my guess,
that's all Jastrow wanted.

31:52.377 --> 31:54.072
Pistols were just chaff.

31:54.946 --> 31:56.538
Any idea what he's up to?

31:56.648 --> 31:57.808
No.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.509
Whatever it is, it's big.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.984
Perhaps I can shed
a little light on the subject.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.451
Devon.

32:03.821 --> 32:05.516
I'm all ears.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.248
According to my sources...

32:08.593 --> 32:11.619
Jastrow is a zealous patriot
who became disenchanted...

32:11.696 --> 32:13.596
when he was passed over
for promotion.

32:13.665 --> 32:17.362
So now he's trying to promote
himself, huh? Anything on his daughter?

32:17.435 --> 32:20.029
Only that she's been to some
of the finest schools in Europe.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.766
Was expelled from most of them
for militant behavior.

32:22.874 --> 32:26.071
She has very expensive tastes
and an unusually high IQ.

32:26.344 --> 32:29.643
And according to Michael,
she also has an exotic taste.

32:29.714 --> 32:33.582
Devon, those laser guns tell me
whatever they've got in mind...

32:33.651 --> 32:35.516
they're planning
to outdo themselves.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.110
Now I need
some more information.

32:37.188 --> 32:39.019
Jastrow's an expert
helicopter pilot.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.524
He's booked a flight
on a commercial carrier...

32:41.592 --> 32:43.253
which leaves from
the international airport...

32:43.328 --> 32:44.590
at noon tomorrow.

32:44.662 --> 32:47.495
Doesn't give us much time,
does it? Or him.

32:47.565 --> 32:50.659
Look. At least we know whatever
he's up to is happening before lunch.

32:50.735 --> 32:52.202
What have you got in mind?

32:52.270 --> 32:55.205
I think I'll rattle Jastrow's
cage and see what crawls out.

32:55.273 --> 32:58.003
Be careful, Michael.
This may backfire.

32:58.276 --> 33:01.245
By the way,
have you located O'Mally yet?

33:01.913 --> 33:04.609
Devon, this guy's harder
to find than a chameleon.

33:04.682 --> 33:06.741
But I'll find him.
Don't you worry.

33:07.618 --> 33:09.142
I'll keep you posted.

33:42.887 --> 33:44.855
Looking for anyone special?

33:45.590 --> 33:47.080
Maybe. Why?

33:48.259 --> 33:49.624
Just curious.

33:50.428 --> 33:52.191
Can I buy you a drink?

33:52.263 --> 33:54.026
Thanks, but I don't drink.

33:54.132 --> 33:55.326
Really?

33:55.666 --> 33:57.031
Good.

33:57.435 --> 33:59.995
Confirms what I thought
when I first met you.

34:01.205 --> 34:03.969
What are you talking about?
Well, I'm talking about you.

34:04.409 --> 34:08.675
A lady who knows what she wants.
And is determined to get it.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.746
You know, I don't think
I like this conversation.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.380
Well, maybe this will
change your mind.

34:18.022 --> 34:19.784
It's $10,000.

34:21.525 --> 34:23.652
You'll never have to
hitchhike again.

34:25.295 --> 34:26.853
How did you know
I hitchhike?

34:28.331 --> 34:29.356
I...

34:29.434 --> 34:31.264
I did a little
checking on you.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.270
Don't be alarmed.

34:33.704 --> 34:35.603
It was for a very,
very good cause.

34:35.672 --> 34:37.766
Oh, really?
And what cause is that?

34:38.042 --> 34:39.703
You and...

34:40.210 --> 34:41.974
Michael Knight.

34:43.481 --> 34:46.177
If you think I'd do anything
to hurt Michael Knight...

34:46.250 --> 34:48.081
you're absolutely wrong.

34:48.652 --> 34:50.882
Who said anything
about hurting anyone?

34:51.188 --> 34:53.521
All I'm talking about is...

34:54.058 --> 34:56.652
keeping him busy for a
few hours tomorrow morning.

34:57.462 --> 34:59.953
That's not too much
to ask for $10,000.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.158
Is it?

35:25.923 --> 35:27.083
Michael.

35:27.225 --> 35:29.193
Michael, I've been looking
all over for you.

35:29.260 --> 35:32.286
Sorry, Sheila, but it's gonna
have to wait. It's about Jastrow.

35:32.363 --> 35:33.387
What about him?

35:33.464 --> 35:36.592
I overheard this guy Rawleigh in the
bar and he said something about...

35:36.667 --> 35:38.692
Jastrow and O'Mally
meeting this morning.

35:38.836 --> 35:42.397
So, the mysterious Capt. O'Mally
is finally showing his colors?

35:42.807 --> 35:44.104
What did he say?

35:44.208 --> 35:47.609
They were going to go
someplace called Vasquez Canyon.

35:47.778 --> 35:50.338
That's great. I'll find him.
Wait. I want to go with you.

35:50.414 --> 35:52.541
No, no, no.
That's not a good idea.

35:52.750 --> 35:55.412
Please, Michael.
I'm scared.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.080
I feel better when I'm
with you than here alone.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.480
All right.

36:08.666 --> 36:09.894
Jump in.

36:13.538 --> 36:15.768
Plot me the fastest course
to Vasquez Rocks.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.273
Right away, Michael.

36:25.716 --> 36:26.876
There they go.

36:26.984 --> 36:28.952
The little ding-a-ling
pulled it off.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.750
Yeah, and Rawleigh and Fletcher
will be waiting on them.

36:32.323 --> 36:34.917
Why do you want Jastrow
so bad? Who is he?

36:35.459 --> 36:39.987
Let's just say I work in support of law
and government. Jastrow works against them.

36:41.465 --> 36:43.729
Good guys and bad guys?
Yeah.

36:44.101 --> 36:46.001
But don't leave
the ladies out.

36:46.504 --> 36:47.630
By the way...

36:48.606 --> 36:51.097
if I haven't told you,
you've been a real big help.

36:53.477 --> 36:54.910
Somebody once said that:

36:55.479 --> 36:56.969
"Good girls finish last."

36:57.848 --> 36:59.338
Not the ones I know.

37:02.653 --> 37:04.018
You all set?

37:05.389 --> 37:07.789
This ought to slow him down.
Slow him down?

37:08.092 --> 37:10.151
We got enough explosives
on both ends of this tunnel...

37:10.228 --> 37:12.253
to bring half
the mountain down on him.

37:12.430 --> 37:15.263
Listen, we got time. Let's
check our equipment once more.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.697
Okay, you want
the front or the rear?

37:17.835 --> 37:21.271
I'll take the back entrance and I'll
come up and catch up with you later.

37:27.511 --> 37:30.844
Michael, what do you think
of me as a person? I mean...

37:31.649 --> 37:33.844
what do you really think
of me as a person?

37:35.753 --> 37:37.277
You want to discuss
this now?

37:37.355 --> 37:39.482
We're doing a 120
on a curving mountain road...

37:39.557 --> 37:41.422
and you want
to discuss this now?

37:41.525 --> 37:43.356
I need to know now.

37:43.661 --> 37:45.026
Please, Michael.

37:45.196 --> 37:47.926
We'll discuss it later.
After we meet O'Mally.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.660
It'll be too late then.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.930
You'll probably
never talk to me again.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.509
All right.

38:04.582 --> 38:07.016
You've been wanting to tell me
something for a long time.

38:07.151 --> 38:10.587
Now we are running out of time,
so why don't you tell me right now?

38:11.822 --> 38:12.982
Okay.

38:14.358 --> 38:15.723
O'Mally...

38:16.327 --> 38:18.727
isn't going to be
in Vasquez Canyon.

38:19.563 --> 38:21.087
And neither are the guns.

38:23.601 --> 38:26.434
How much did Jastrow
pay you to set me up?

38:26.837 --> 38:29.931
It was his daughter
and it was for $10,000.

38:30.007 --> 38:32.305
You've got to be thinking that
something is wrong with it...

38:32.376 --> 38:33.673
or you wouldn't be
telling me now.

38:33.744 --> 38:35.006
Yeah, you're right.

38:35.513 --> 38:37.811
I'm thinking there's
something wrong with me.

38:39.884 --> 38:41.442
You have to understand.

38:42.687 --> 38:44.052
That money...

38:44.722 --> 38:48.214
it was a chance for me to change
everything in my whole life.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.725
To be able to...

38:50.127 --> 38:52.721
to eat normally while I was
learning to type or...

38:52.797 --> 38:54.788
or paint houses
or do anything.

38:54.865 --> 38:56.298
And, if not that, to...

38:57.234 --> 38:59.964
well, to retire my thumb
and buy some bus tickets.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.139
I'm sorry, Michael.

39:05.042 --> 39:06.532
I'm grateful you told me.

39:07.311 --> 39:08.505
You are?

39:08.946 --> 39:10.106
Yes, I am.

39:10.548 --> 39:11.708
Now get out.

39:11.882 --> 39:13.372
Would you make up your mind?

39:13.451 --> 39:15.646
I did, get out.
I'm still going in.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.683
Then I'm going with you.
No, you're not.

39:17.755 --> 39:20.019
Yes, I am, and don't you
try to argue with me.

39:21.792 --> 39:23.282
This is different.

39:23.661 --> 39:26.459
I've never had to wrestle
my way into a car before.

39:28.833 --> 39:32.098
I guess you're as safe in KITT
as any place else you go.

39:32.169 --> 39:33.500
All right, let's do it.

39:38.175 --> 39:40.769
The canyon's on the other side
of this tunnel, buddy.

39:41.178 --> 39:43.942
Stay tuned, partner. Stay
tuned. Right, Michael.

39:53.157 --> 39:54.818
He's in the tunnel.
Ten-four.

40:08.606 --> 40:10.597
All right, Rawleigh, hit it.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.118
They've sealed off
both ends...

40:30.194 --> 40:32.025
of the tunnel, Michael.
We're trapped.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.996
Is he saying
we're buried alive?

40:34.064 --> 40:36.897
Let's shed some light on it
before we panic here.

40:39.837 --> 40:42.772
Sure looks that way.
KITT, give me a readout.

40:42.907 --> 40:45.933
There are 90.8 tons of dirt
blocking the front.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.843
More in the rear. Could be
too much for us, Michael.

40:50.214 --> 40:52.273
Michael, is he saying
we're going to die?

40:52.349 --> 40:55.648
A car is telling me
I'm gonna die. Hang on.

40:57.054 --> 40:58.954
All right.
I'm backing up to the end.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.752
See if we got enough room
for maximum turbo boost.

41:05.629 --> 41:09.121
We'd be traveling 247 miles
per hour when we hit the wall.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.259
I'm getting out...
I wouldn't do that.

41:11.735 --> 41:14.704
Our impact could bring the
whole mountain down on you.

41:15.239 --> 41:16.968
How's our communications,
KITT?

41:18.509 --> 41:21.672
Too much mineral content in the
tunnel creating interference, Michael.

41:22.046 --> 41:24.879
All right. We're on our own.
We go for it.

41:24.949 --> 41:26.280
Hey, don't I get a vote?

41:26.350 --> 41:28.818
Yeah, yeah.
It's two against one.

41:29.787 --> 41:32.915
I'm at full power, Michael.
All right.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.317
Let her rip!

41:47.571 --> 41:49.129
Way to go, partner!

41:49.306 --> 41:51.103
KITT, you are awesome!

41:51.175 --> 41:54.406
Thank you, but I'm afraid the
jolt knocked out several circuits.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.911
Check your radar.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.642
It appears functional.
What am I looking for?

41:59.717 --> 42:02.686
Devon said Jastrow leased a
chopper. See if you can pick it up.

42:02.753 --> 42:05.881
Michael, he could be anywhere. He
could be hundreds of miles from here.

42:05.956 --> 42:08.584
No, he can't. The flight he booked
leaves in an hour and a half.

42:08.826 --> 42:10.453
We're at least
an hour to the airport.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.964
So the target has got to be within
a half hour's driving radius...

42:14.031 --> 42:15.726
for those Rovers
to make it on time.

42:15.799 --> 42:18.427
I have one, Michael. About 20
miles north of our location.

42:18.502 --> 42:21.471
Okay. Check the area for
structures that contain something...

42:21.539 --> 42:24.269
of great value.
Mints, banks, museums.

42:26.343 --> 42:30.575
Good, good. Now punch up the one with no
overhead wires to interfere with a chopper.

42:32.082 --> 42:34.312
The Anderson Precious
Metals Depository?

42:34.385 --> 42:36.478
Terrific.
Okay, lady, out.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.748
Wait a minute, you said...

42:37.821 --> 42:40.051
No arguments, you put your thumb
to work. You find a phone...

42:40.124 --> 42:42.388
you call FLAG headquarters.
Ask for Devon Miles.

42:42.459 --> 42:45.087
Tell him I may need him
for a backup. Just in case.

42:45.162 --> 42:48.063
Okay.
Be careful. Please.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.326
See you later?
Count on it.

42:58.909 --> 43:01.343
Okay, let's go get ourselves
a chopper, pal.

43:17.962 --> 43:19.953
Hey, stop! Stop!

43:24.101 --> 43:26.262
Please, I've got
to make a phone call.

43:26.737 --> 43:28.864
Rawleigh. Fletcher.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.630
I'm on my final approach.

43:31.008 --> 43:33.806
Split up. Move into
your firing positions.

43:34.511 --> 43:36.741
Got you.
We read you.

43:38.849 --> 43:41.283
The helicopter should
be here in three minutes.

43:41.352 --> 43:43.752
What's our ETA?
One minute, seven seconds.

43:49.660 --> 43:52.390
Jastrow, this is Rawleigh.
I'm in position.

43:52.963 --> 43:55.056
This is Fletcher. Me, too.

44:06.577 --> 44:09.341
He's here sooner than
scheduled. What's he doing?

44:09.413 --> 44:11.381
Fletcher.
Take out the transmitter.

44:11.448 --> 44:12.608
Go.

44:19.823 --> 44:22.417
That's not our chopper.
He's coming in. Open fire.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.893
Rawleigh, take out
the central control system.

44:29.533 --> 44:30.693
Go!

44:38.208 --> 44:39.197
Go.

44:41.745 --> 44:43.440
We're running out of time,
pal.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.982
I'll give you all the power
I have, Michael. I'll take it.

44:50.854 --> 44:53.049
Fletcher,
target in on that T-top.

44:58.262 --> 45:00.230
Whoa!
They found a new target!

45:11.775 --> 45:14.005
Can you micro-jam
their firing mechanisms?

45:14.211 --> 45:17.044
No, but I may be able to
close their induction vents.

45:17.147 --> 45:19.377
I think you'll find
the result satisfactory.

45:23.754 --> 45:25.278
Nice going, buddy.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.379
Okay, KITT.
Reel him in, buddy.

46:10.534 --> 46:11.762
Beautiful.

46:13.003 --> 46:14.300
Beautiful.

46:21.712 --> 46:23.202
Tom, you would not believe it.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.975
This is the car
I was telling you about.

46:25.048 --> 46:27.039
It's awesome. This car does
turbo boost.

46:27.117 --> 46:29.551
It jumps and it talks.
It actually talks.

46:29.853 --> 46:31.548
Hi.
Oh, Michael.

46:31.688 --> 46:33.918
I want you to meet...
Wait. Let me guess.

46:34.324 --> 46:36.019
Tom O'Mally.

46:36.894 --> 46:39.658
You're a lucky guy.
Oh, you mean Sheila?

46:39.897 --> 46:43.060
No, I mean you're lucky I didn't run
into you a couple of days sooner...

46:43.133 --> 46:45.033
when I thought you were
involved with Jastrow.

46:45.102 --> 46:46.933
Yeah, that, too.

46:47.471 --> 46:50.497
You see, a few months back I was
having a good time at this party...

46:50.574 --> 46:53.168
and I knew Jastrow from
some of the other conventions.

46:53.844 --> 46:56.176
I guess I let my mouth run
faster than my brain...

46:56.246 --> 46:58.043
and I told him
about the lasers.

46:59.283 --> 47:01.843
I think it's time
for me to retire.

47:02.152 --> 47:04.211
Change my lifestyle
a little.

47:05.622 --> 47:07.886
Well, well, well. It looks
like you can't lose for winning.

47:07.958 --> 47:10.586
If you mean Sheila, you're
right. She's the greatest.

47:10.661 --> 47:12.822
No. He's the greatest.

47:15.332 --> 47:17.323
And you are
the second greatest.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.668
What about me?
You?

47:21.872 --> 47:24.067
You are the very,
very best.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.499
Goodbye, Michael Knight.
Goodbye, Sheila.

47:27.611 --> 47:29.738
Goodbye, KITT.
Goodbye, Sheila.

47:33.717 --> 47:34.877
What do you think about that?

47:34.952 --> 47:37.477
I think she has
excellent taste in cars.

47:37.554 --> 47:40.421
However, her taste in men
could be open for discussion.

47:40.490 --> 47:43.015
Just because she chose me
before you?

47:43.093 --> 47:45.618
Oh, no, Michael.
I meant O'Mally.

47:47.097 --> 47:49.463
Yeah. Somewhere,
in the back of my mind...

47:49.533 --> 47:51.524
I still feel like
I'm the lucky one.

47:51.602 --> 47:53.035
Oh, by the way...

47:53.804 --> 47:56.739
I forgot to ask him where
he's been the last three days.
