WEBVTT

00:02.333 --> 00:04.166
Kiai! Kiai!

00:04.250 --> 00:05.417
Kiai!

00:06.250 --> 00:07.458
- Whoo!
- Wow, Jack.

00:07.542 --> 00:08.583
How do you do that?

00:08.667 --> 00:10.000
It comes from inside me.

00:10.083 --> 00:11.000
It's my Kiai.

00:11.083 --> 00:13.542
The boys in my family
get their Kiais removed.

00:13.625 --> 00:14.709
It's tradition.

00:15.375 --> 00:17.000
A kiai is the sound you make

00:17.083 --> 00:19.083
when you release
the power of your inner self.

00:19.166 --> 00:21.166
Come on, guys. Free your inner beast!

00:22.542 --> 00:23.500
Kiai!

00:24.417 --> 00:26.083
- Kiai! Whoo.
There you go.

00:26.709 --> 00:27.917
Coo!

00:30.250 --> 00:32.083
Your inner beast sounds like a sick dove.

00:32.834 --> 00:34.000
Gah.

00:36.458 --> 00:40.500
Oh. Are you and Rudy ready for the big
sensei-student tournament this week?

00:40.583 --> 00:42.375
Totally.
And since I’ll be competing with Rudy,

00:42.500 --> 00:44.000
- Mm-hmm.
- I’ve been training my butt off.

00:44.083 --> 00:46.041
Dude, our timing during the routine
has to be perfect.

00:46.125 --> 00:47.750
Yeah.
- You know how competitive he is.

00:47.834 --> 00:51.208
Jack, I hope you're prepared
for our trip to San Francisco,

00:51.291 --> 00:52.291
because I know I am.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.667
I found my rubber vomit

00:54.750 --> 00:56.291
and my deluxe whoopee cushion.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.709
What makes it deluxe?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.542
- Oof.
- Oh.

01:01.959 --> 01:02.917
The smell.

01:03.792 --> 01:07.166
Pfft. Rudy, you're not taking
this competition seriously.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.208
Don't you want to win?

01:08.291 --> 01:09.875
Come on, let's just go and have fun.

01:09.959 --> 01:11.125
Make some memories.

01:11.208 --> 01:12.417
Road trip.

01:16.375 --> 01:18.250
All right, see you later, guys.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.375
I got a little pre-anniversary gift
for Julie.

01:20.458 --> 01:22.333
I made a chocolate rose by hand.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.834
What happened to my rose?

01:25.959 --> 01:26.792
Wow, dude.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.542
It looks like someone ate the head off it.

01:31.417 --> 01:32.959
My rose.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.375
My sweet rose!

01:40.709 --> 01:41.917
Kiai!

01:43.917 --> 01:45.417
Ow! Oh.

01:46.709 --> 01:48.667
You just met my inner beast!

01:48.750 --> 01:52.125
Oh, dude.
Eddie ate some of your rose, too.

02:42.959 --> 02:44.333
Look at this.

02:44.417 --> 02:46.000
Pretty sweet, huh, Jack?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.166
Uh...

02:49.291 --> 02:51.417
I think you left a bag out in the hall.

02:58.375 --> 02:59.500
Nice room.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.834
Okay. We'll unpack,

03:01.917 --> 03:02.917
have a great night's sleep,

03:03.000 --> 03:04.500
<i>then hit the ground running
in the morning.</i>

03:04.583 --> 03:05.917
I just need one drawer, you can have--

03:06.000 --> 03:07.250
Don't need it.

03:10.041 --> 03:11.375
What are you doing?

03:11.458 --> 03:13.750
These hotel movie prices are outrageous.

03:13.834 --> 03:16.041
That's why I always bring
my own satellite dish.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.125
Are you sure that's a good idea?

03:19.750 --> 03:21.959
I do it all the time.

03:30.959 --> 03:33.750
Milton, do you like
my special anniversary card?

03:35.250 --> 03:37.041
Yeah. It's really sweet.

03:37.125 --> 03:38.208
And big.

03:39.542 --> 03:41.417
As big as my love for you.

03:54.959 --> 03:56.250
I’ll treasure it always.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.750
Hey, guys. What's up?

04:01.834 --> 04:03.291
We just came from Spanish.

04:03.375 --> 04:05.917
Jerry's bummed
'cause he failed another test.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.542
Which is kind of weird,
'cause I speak it fluently.

04:12.583 --> 04:13.667
What does that mean?

04:14.208 --> 04:16.875
Well, how am I supposed to know?
I just told you I’m failing Spanish.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.083
Forget Spanish.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.625
I got girl problems.

04:22.166 --> 04:23.417
Girls don't even talk to you.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.792
That's the problem.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.667
You know what your problem is?

04:29.750 --> 04:31.291
You lack confidence.

04:31.375 --> 04:32.667
When you ask a girl out,

04:32.750 --> 04:35.625
make her feel that if she doesn't
go out with you, it's her loss.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.667
And you. You speak the language,

04:37.750 --> 04:39.583
don't look at it as taking a test.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.792
Look at it as if you're
having a conversation

04:41.875 --> 04:42.959
with a piece of paper.

04:44.208 --> 04:45.792
Hey, that might actually work.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.125
Wait. Milton,

04:47.208 --> 04:49.792
where's all this great advice coming from?

04:49.875 --> 04:50.792
I don't know.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.750
But yesterday when I did that kiai,

04:53.834 --> 04:55.291
I think I woke up my inner voice.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.792
And now I see everything so clearly.

04:57.875 --> 04:59.375
Kiai!

05:01.542 --> 05:03.125
I think I tore my kiai.

05:43.208 --> 05:44.291
Rudy!

05:44.417 --> 05:45.875
What the heck are you doing?

05:46.625 --> 05:48.959
Oh, having trouble sleeping, huh?

05:49.041 --> 05:50.792
Me too.

05:51.625 --> 05:53.000
See what's on TV?

05:53.083 --> 05:54.667
Look, I don't care what's on t--

05:55.709 --> 05:56.875
Whoa.

05:56.959 --> 05:58.875
It's Bobby Wasabi in
"The Big Book Beatdown."

05:58.959 --> 06:00.542
Yeah. I love this part.

06:00.625 --> 06:04.041
This is where he takes out
the evil librarians with an almanac.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.875
"No! You're overdue, sister!"

06:07.792 --> 06:08.792
Here we go.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.375
Bobby and his partner
are about to pull off

06:10.458 --> 06:12.625
the greatest karate move of all time.

06:12.709 --> 06:14.625
The Wasabi whip.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.083
Here it comes.

06:16.166 --> 06:17.208
They run at each other,

06:17.291 --> 06:18.333
they lock nunchucks.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.834
Whoa, dude. They're airborne.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.834
You know, if we did
that move in competition,

06:25.542 --> 06:27.291
- We would--
- Be dead.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.834
That move's practically impossible.

06:30.917 --> 06:34.208
Bobby trained for over 10 years
and was still only able to do it one time.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.291
Look, it's almost time to get up.

06:37.417 --> 06:39.583
- We should probably get to bed.
- Oh, yeah.

06:45.291 --> 06:46.750
What's that?

06:46.834 --> 06:49.667
Oh, well, sometimes I have a hard time
falling asleep in hotels.

06:49.750 --> 06:52.834
This little machine makes
a bunch of different soothing sounds.

06:52.917 --> 06:54.750
The calming beaches of Mexico--

06:54.834 --> 06:56.333
My favorite.

07:10.583 --> 07:12.500
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

07:12.583 --> 07:13.792
Dude, I took your advice,

07:13.875 --> 07:15.542
and look what I got on my Spanish test.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.667
She gave me two stacked-up "D"s.

07:18.458 --> 07:20.834
Jerry, that's not two stacked-up "D"s.
That's a "B".

07:23.792 --> 07:25.250
Whoa.

07:26.667 --> 07:27.792
A "B"?

07:28.583 --> 07:29.792
Tonight,

07:29.875 --> 07:31.917
it's just the two of us.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.542
Double feature.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.166
And that means back-to-back Eddie.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.709
Ahh!

07:40.792 --> 07:42.000
<i>Dude!</i>

07:42.083 --> 07:43.750
Ever since I took your advice,

07:43.834 --> 07:46.000
I can't keep the girls at school away.

07:46.083 --> 07:49.041
Dude, everybody's talking about
how you changed us.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.542
- Check it out, man.
Yeah.

07:52.291 --> 07:53.709
They all want your advice.

07:54.667 --> 07:56.458
That's the power of my inner voice.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.834
I really have unleashed my beast.

07:58.917 --> 07:59.917
Yeah!

08:00.000 --> 08:01.041
There you are.

08:01.125 --> 08:03.750
I wanted to talk to you about
our anniversary dinner tomorrow night.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.000
I would love to talk with you, Julie.

08:06.083 --> 08:07.917
But you're gonna have to go
to the back of the line.

08:08.709 --> 08:10.000
What?

08:10.083 --> 08:11.542
Hello, I’m Milton.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.208
How can I fix you?

08:13.750 --> 08:15.000
Gah!

08:18.500 --> 08:19.792
Trent Darby,

08:19.875 --> 08:21.750
checking into the penthouse.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.000
Trent Darby?

08:25.083 --> 08:26.250
I don't believe it.

08:26.291 --> 08:28.917
Little Rudy Gillespie?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.500
You got a job here.

08:30.583 --> 08:31.834
Good for you.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.250
Be careful with our bags.

08:35.291 --> 08:36.625
Oh.

08:36.709 --> 08:38.417
No, I don't-- I don't work here.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.083
So what are you doing in town?

08:43.166 --> 08:46.250
We were on our way
to the Grandmaster Championships in Japan,

08:46.375 --> 08:48.500
and we thought we'd drop in
and grab a quick trophy

08:48.583 --> 08:50.500
at the sensei-student tournament.

08:50.583 --> 08:52.375
This is Donnie, my best student.

08:52.458 --> 08:55.208
He's a master of the
Mata-hisa-hushu discipline.

08:55.959 --> 08:58.333
Uh, well, this is my best student, Jack,

08:58.417 --> 09:01.208
and he's also a master
of the Mata-hishy...

09:01.291 --> 09:03.166
Mushy-hesu-hes...

09:04.250 --> 09:05.375
He does that, too.

09:07.625 --> 09:10.583
Oh, you two are here to compete?

09:12.583 --> 09:14.208
You never learn, do you, Rudy?

09:14.709 --> 09:15.917
This is gonna be great.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.291
That guy seems like a jerk.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.458
It's gonna be great to compete
against him, right, Rudy?

09:23.542 --> 09:25.625
Oh, we're not gonna be
competing against him.

09:26.625 --> 09:27.500
Why?

09:27.625 --> 09:29.125
Because we're checking out.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.417
- Check out!
-

09:30.500 --> 09:32.458
Check out! Check out!

09:35.041 --> 09:37.250
Just because you ran into some jerk
from your past,

09:37.333 --> 09:39.375
you're gonna quit the tournament,
march down to the lobby,

09:39.458 --> 09:40.625
and walk out the front door?

09:40.709 --> 09:42.750
Of course not, you're gonna
zip me into your suitcase

09:42.834 --> 09:44.000
and throw me out the window.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.083
You've always said you don't run away
from a challenge.

09:48.166 --> 09:49.291
You face it head on.

09:49.375 --> 09:50.500
You shouldn't listen to me.

09:50.625 --> 09:52.291
I just asked you
to throw me out the window.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.667
What is it about this guy?

09:55.750 --> 09:57.750
Trent Darby stole my life.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.291
Look.

10:01.375 --> 10:03.625
My girlfriend Lenore
is sitting over there.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.750
So I’m gonna show off for her,
and destroy you!

10:09.291 --> 10:11.125
<i>My fists are gonna be flying so fast</i>

10:11.208 --> 10:12.166
you'll never even--

10:15.291 --> 10:16.959
Why am I on the ground?

10:19.125 --> 10:20.375
My girlfriend Lenore and I

10:20.458 --> 10:22.333
are kind of going through
a little bit of a thing.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.750
So I’m gonna be taking my anger out

10:26.834 --> 10:27.875
on your face!

10:30.792 --> 10:32.667
I’m on the ground again, aren't I?

10:33.792 --> 10:36.875
My girlfriend is
clearly now your girlfriend.

10:39.083 --> 10:40.375
So I was really hoping

10:40.458 --> 10:41.834
that you could take it easy on me

10:41.959 --> 10:44.792
because my self-esteem
is at an all-time low--

10:48.375 --> 10:49.625
Thanks for listening.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.125
After beating me, his life took off.

10:53.208 --> 10:55.125
You know, he got all the confidence,

10:55.208 --> 10:57.041
the string of dojos,

10:57.125 --> 10:58.333
and the Lenore.

10:59.417 --> 11:02.208
And I wound up where I am.

11:03.667 --> 11:06.208
There's nothing wrong with where you are.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.834
Dude, you're a great sensei,

11:07.917 --> 11:09.875
And you mean everything to your students.

11:09.959 --> 11:10.959
Do you know what?

11:11.041 --> 11:14.375
We're gonna stay right here
and do the best we can, together.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.083
You know what, Jack?

11:18.583 --> 11:20.041
You're right.

11:20.125 --> 11:22.041
Thank you, that is exactly

11:22.125 --> 11:23.750
the kind of pep talk that I needed.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.792
I already feel better.

11:25.875 --> 11:26.709
Good.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.709
You really need to get rid
of that whoopee cushion.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.709
Yes, because that was definitely
the whoopee cushion.

11:36.959 --> 11:38.417
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

11:38.500 --> 11:40.291
Where have you been?

11:40.375 --> 11:42.542
Only selling out my first seminar.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.709
It's gonna be right here
tomorrow night in the dojo.

11:44.792 --> 11:48.000
It's called "Holla at your Inna Winna!"

11:48.083 --> 11:49.041
What?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.875
Tomorrow's our anniversary.

11:51.458 --> 11:52.834
You gotta understand.

11:52.917 --> 11:55.375
Milton doesn't just belong
to you guys anymore.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.917
Milton belongs to the world!

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Now that my inner beast is released,

12:00.083 --> 12:02.959
I’ve become a strong, independent warrior!

12:03.041 --> 12:04.875
-
- Mommy.

12:04.959 --> 12:05.917
Could you pick me up?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.291
My bike has a flat.

12:08.583 --> 12:10.125
Well, then what do I pay you for?

12:15.125 --> 12:16.500
-
- Ha!

12:18.417 --> 12:19.417
Come on, Jack.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.667
We've been over and over and over this.

12:22.667 --> 12:23.917
Where are your toes?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.125
On my feet?

12:26.625 --> 12:28.792
No, see, your toes
are pointed toward Canada,

12:28.875 --> 12:31.000
and my toes are pointed toward Memphis.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.291
Well, how about we compromise

12:33.375 --> 12:35.375
and have our toes meet in Cleveland?

12:37.250 --> 12:38.583
What are you laughing at?

12:38.667 --> 12:39.917
I know we're hideous.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.166
Get out!

12:42.417 --> 12:44.417
I know you're stressed
about beating Trent but,

12:44.500 --> 12:45.583
dude, what happened to the guy

12:45.667 --> 12:47.750
who wanted to come and have some fun
and make some memories?

12:47.834 --> 12:48.667
That guy's dead.

12:48.750 --> 12:49.875
And your toes killed him.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.500
You convinced me that we could compete.

12:53.583 --> 12:54.917
I’m doing the best I can.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.375
Well, your best isn't good enough!

12:56.458 --> 12:57.625
You're an embarrassment!

12:58.667 --> 13:00.083
I’m the embarrassment?

13:00.667 --> 13:02.500
- I’m out of here.
- Fine.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.583
Fine. Walk away!

13:06.834 --> 13:08.834
Hey, there's the guy.

13:09.750 --> 13:10.875
Come here.

13:11.709 --> 13:13.041
Listen, uh...

13:13.125 --> 13:15.792
do you know how to use nunchucks
and break a board?

13:15.917 --> 13:18.291
And would you mind if I could get
a quick little peek at your toes?

13:36.041 --> 13:37.291
Kiai!

13:41.792 --> 13:43.917
Can I get a Holla?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.333
Holla!

13:45.417 --> 13:46.875
- Whoo!
Yeah.

13:49.542 --> 13:51.667
Why is a mouse a mouse?

13:52.667 --> 13:54.250
Because he squeaks.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.250
Oh.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.291
Why is a lion a lion?

13:57.375 --> 14:00.792
-
- Because he roars!

14:01.458 --> 14:04.125
Which is lion for Holla!

14:04.208 --> 14:05.458
Holla!

14:05.542 --> 14:06.542
Yes!

14:06.625 --> 14:08.000
I can bring it out of you.

14:08.083 --> 14:08.917
I can.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.125
Do you trust me?

14:10.208 --> 14:11.250
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you?

14:11.291 --> 14:12.500
Well, I trust you.

14:12.583 --> 14:14.458
Front row, catch me.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.667
<i>I’m okay.</i>

14:19.458 --> 14:20.500
<i>Holla!</i>

14:32.959 --> 14:34.375
Hi-yah!

14:39.500 --> 14:40.417
Hello, Lenore.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.000
I see you've really let yourself go.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.500
-
- Nice.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.166
We got the high score!

14:53.625 --> 14:54.834
Nice?

14:55.792 --> 14:57.750
You cost us the perfect score.

14:57.834 --> 14:59.834
You didn't have full extension
on your side kicks.

14:59.917 --> 15:03.041
We came here to show these losers
what perfection looks like.

15:03.125 --> 15:04.458
You're an embarrassment.

15:09.458 --> 15:10.959
No one should talk to you like that.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.500
No one should talk to anyone like that.

15:15.834 --> 15:16.834
Thanks, but...

15:16.917 --> 15:18.166
I don't really care what he says.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.250
I mean, he's my sensei, not my friend.

15:25.792 --> 15:26.709
Jack!

15:26.792 --> 15:28.291
I’m so glad you're here.

15:28.375 --> 15:29.291
I’m not a quitter.

15:29.417 --> 15:30.917
If I start something, I finish it.

15:32.291 --> 15:33.166
Look...

15:33.250 --> 15:35.166
I said something that I
never should have said.

15:36.542 --> 15:37.583
You're not the embarrassment.

15:38.583 --> 15:39.667
I’m the embarrassment.

15:40.583 --> 15:41.542
Rudy...

15:42.542 --> 15:45.375
Even though you sometimes
turn into a flaming nutcase,

15:47.166 --> 15:48.709
I know you're always
gonna be there for me,

15:49.500 --> 15:50.834
and I’m always gonna be there for you.

15:51.792 --> 15:53.083
- Thanks, Jack.
-

15:53.166 --> 15:54.333
Uh, you know,

15:54.417 --> 15:56.417
if we get a perfect score
we could still win this.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.417
We just have to do something
they've never seen before.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.875
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?

16:00.959 --> 16:02.250
The Wasabi Whip.

16:03.083 --> 16:03.917
Oh.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.166
I was thinking man-tassels,
but the Wasabi Whip's good.

16:08.250 --> 16:09.709
Do you really think we can do it?

16:09.792 --> 16:11.583
Rudy, we've seen that movie 100 times.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.041
When you and I work together,

16:13.125 --> 16:14.291
nothing's impossible.

16:15.458 --> 16:16.959
What the heck is a man-tassel?

16:21.333 --> 16:23.542
Holla! Holla! Holla!

16:23.625 --> 16:24.667
All right!

16:24.750 --> 16:25.750
Let's take another question

16:25.834 --> 16:27.959
From a winner in waiting!

16:28.625 --> 16:30.125
Uh...

16:30.208 --> 16:31.625
You. You in the back.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.250
I can't see you, but go ahead.

16:33.333 --> 16:34.792
I have a boyfriend,

16:34.875 --> 16:36.500
but because of his new success,

16:36.583 --> 16:38.834
he no longer has time for me in his life.

16:38.917 --> 16:40.250
Or his friends.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.000
Yeah. He's turned into a real snot-donkey.

16:44.959 --> 16:47.208
Sometimes you've gotta be a hotel operator

16:47.291 --> 16:50.000
and give snot-donkeys
in your life a wake-up call.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.792
Can I get a Holla?

16:51.875 --> 16:52.917
Holla!

16:53.458 --> 16:55.792
You've gotta remind this guy
of what's important to him.

16:55.875 --> 16:58.583
In fact, give this jerk a call right now.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.125
- Do it now!
Do it now!

17:01.208 --> 17:03.333
Do it now! Do it now!

17:03.417 --> 17:04.375
<i>Do it now!</i>

17:09.333 --> 17:10.542
Hello?

17:11.917 --> 17:13.208
I miss you, jerk.

17:15.333 --> 17:16.417
Julie?

17:16.500 --> 17:18.208
You're not a nice person anymore.

17:18.291 --> 17:20.250
I want the old Milton back.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.959
- We all do.
- Yeah.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.750
What have I done?

17:26.208 --> 17:28.166
They're talking about me,
ladies and gentlemen.

17:29.917 --> 17:32.083
You see this ponytail?

17:32.166 --> 17:33.667
Like me,

17:33.750 --> 17:34.959
it's a fake.

17:37.208 --> 17:38.458
Guys, I’m sorry.

17:39.041 --> 17:41.959
I got so wrapped up in thinking
I could fix everybody else's life

17:42.083 --> 17:43.542
that I forgot what was important to me--

17:44.166 --> 17:45.333
My friends.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.041
Here's the difference
between these people and you--

17:48.750 --> 17:51.000
You guys, I know I can trust.

17:56.125 --> 17:57.333
Hey, you want to go catch a movie?

17:57.417 --> 17:58.667
- Sounds good.
- Cool.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.375
I had that coming, didn't I?

18:05.500 --> 18:06.333
Little bit.

18:08.333 --> 18:09.375
If you're still willing,

18:09.458 --> 18:11.709
I’d like to take you
to a romantic anniversary dinner

18:11.792 --> 18:12.792
at Cheesy Chad's.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.125
Order anything you want.

18:15.208 --> 18:17.041
I just made $19,000.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.542
Holla!

18:22.208 --> 18:24.542
<i>Trent and Donnie are still in the lead</i>

18:24.625 --> 18:27.166

Whoo! Yeah!

19:19.667 --> 19:21.166
I’m losing my grip!

19:21.250 --> 19:23.250
Don't worry, I got you.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.375
No, I don't.

19:24.458 --> 19:25.625
Whoa!

19:36.542 --> 19:39.208
Ow, my beautiful, beautiful nose.

19:39.291 --> 19:40.417
Ow!

19:41.291 --> 19:42.375
Rudy?

19:42.458 --> 19:43.667
You okay, buddy?

19:47.583 --> 19:50.083
I guess that didn't
work out too well, did it?

19:50.208 --> 19:51.709
No, not even a little bit.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.792
Dude, I don't care that Trent beat us.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.125
We had fun!

19:56.208 --> 19:57.750
This whole trip was about making memories,

19:57.834 --> 19:59.458
and we just made a great one.

20:54.375 --> 20:55.542
No, this seems about right.
