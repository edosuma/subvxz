WEBVTT

00:28.962 --> 00:32.031
[music playing]

00:36.003 --> 00:38.706
NARRATOR: On the
distant planet of Snerd,

00:38.806 --> 00:43.644
to enforce the prohibition
of sexual activity,

00:43.744 --> 00:47.615
the government created
the Limp-Tron 69,

00:47.715 --> 00:52.553
a device that controls the
planet's gravitational pull.

00:52.653 --> 00:56.524
This causes the people
to lose all interest

00:56.624 --> 01:01.095
in any sexual activity
and renders their organs

01:01.195 --> 01:05.032
in a perpetual
state of flaccidity.

01:05.132 --> 01:09.737
This gives the planetary
government the ability

01:09.837 --> 01:13.407
to rule a sexless planet.

01:13.507 --> 01:17.711
However, this
gravitational system

01:17.811 --> 01:22.716
does not work on all creatures.

02:06.860 --> 02:13.100
The Interplanetary Court of
Morality is now in session.

02:13.201 --> 02:17.705
The Honorable Judge
Melvin P. Enis presiding.

02:22.476 --> 02:27.281
Counselor, your
clients are accused

02:27.381 --> 02:33.053
of being in direct violation
of the planet's strict rules

02:33.153 --> 02:37.825
prohibiting sexual
acts of any kind.

02:37.925 --> 02:42.996
How do these things plead?

02:43.096 --> 02:45.499
Not guilty, Your Honor.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.133
What?

02:46.234 --> 02:47.768
Oh, no, no, no.

02:47.868 --> 02:48.602
[grumble]

02:48.702 --> 02:49.537
Oh.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.406
Your Honor, these
three creatures

02:52.506 --> 02:54.208
are foreign to our planet.

02:54.308 --> 02:58.779
Their DNA is unaffected
by the Limp-Tron 69.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.649
Upon further research--

03:01.749 --> 03:03.016
[laughing]

03:03.116 --> 03:03.984
Order!

03:04.084 --> 03:06.687
I will have order!

03:06.787 --> 03:08.622
I apologize, Your Honor.

03:08.722 --> 03:09.957
If I may continue--

03:10.057 --> 03:12.793
You may not, counselor.

03:12.893 --> 03:17.998
There are vile and
disgusting creatures,

03:18.098 --> 03:21.502
and I want to know
nothing about them.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.872
Your Honor, they weren't
caught doing anything wrong.

03:24.972 --> 03:29.377
Their ship crashed on our
planet during the DO Showers.

03:29.477 --> 03:33.614
It is my opinion we
send them back home.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.317
Oh.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.486
Your opinion?

03:41.622 --> 03:45.826
Your opinion means
huggabaloo to me.

03:45.926 --> 03:50.698
I know exactly what they are
and where they come from,

03:50.798 --> 03:54.268
and I'm sentencing
them to termination.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.304
Judge, you can't sentence
them to death just

03:56.404 --> 03:59.006
because of where they're from.

03:59.106 --> 04:02.643
Is that right, Cass Coridore?

04:02.743 --> 04:07.981
In that case, I find you guilty
of being a sexual sympathizer,

04:08.081 --> 04:13.954
and I'm sentencing you 10
Snerdian years of hard labor

04:14.054 --> 04:16.023
at the Third Moon Prison.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.257
For what?

04:17.358 --> 04:19.493
Doing my job as a space lawyer?

04:19.593 --> 04:22.596
Now it's 20 Snerdian years.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.366
Maybe that will
toughen you up and make

04:25.466 --> 04:27.167
you watch your queer mouth.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.001
[laughing]

04:28.101 --> 04:30.538
[farting]

04:30.638 --> 04:31.872
Oh, my.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.474
Oh!

04:33.574 --> 04:36.977
Get them out of my face.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.912
Oh!

04:39.012 --> 04:41.482
I hate the Chubbies.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.250
Oh!

04:43.351 --> 04:44.852
Fucking perverts.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.776
[beeping]

05:16.950 --> 05:20.788
Yeah, this is Holy Driver
1, requesting permission

05:20.888 --> 05:23.791
to engage off of Snerd.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.259
CONTROL: Oh, one
moment, Holy Driver 1.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.629
We have some late
arrivals for you.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.136
What have we got?

05:36.236 --> 05:40.140
Three turds and
a piece of shit.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.410
Get in the cage.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.477
Where are they going?

05:43.577 --> 05:45.679
I got deliveries to make.

05:45.779 --> 05:52.886
Straight to the Third Moon
Prison Planet for termination.

05:52.986 --> 05:53.921
I'm not to be terminated.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.023
Shut up, pedophile.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.858
I'm not a pedophile.

05:57.958 --> 05:58.859
I'm a lawyer.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.628
One more word out
of you, and you'll

06:00.728 --> 06:05.098
be kissing your own
ass in your dreams.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.467
What does that even mean?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.902
Oh, I'm warning you, boy.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.376
(WHISPERING) Listen,
I don't think it's fair

06:16.477 --> 06:19.179
what they're going to
do to you, so I'm going

06:19.279 --> 06:20.147
to let you guys out.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.895
[cough]

06:34.995 --> 06:37.865
Got it.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.333
Pucker up, butterscotch.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.935
[thud]

06:44.772 --> 06:47.307
All right, are
you done in here?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.742
Oh, yeah, I'm done.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.879
Then get the fuck off my ship.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.714
You don't have to
be rude about it.

06:56.016 --> 06:56.750
Beam!

07:00.921 --> 07:04.458
This is Holy Driver 1,
requesting permission

07:04.558 --> 07:08.929
yet again to take off
from Snerd to the Third

07:09.029 --> 07:11.231
Moon Prison Planet.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.433
CONTROL: Permission granted.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.571
Thanks, Pussy Lips.

07:28.415 --> 07:31.284
[chubbies snickering]

07:31.384 --> 07:33.854
CHUBBY: Get this faggot.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.456
[alarm blaring]

07:46.700 --> 07:47.901
What are you doing?

07:54.141 --> 07:54.875
Stop!

08:04.952 --> 08:05.886
Hey, come back.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.120
Bye bye.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.122
I was trying to help you.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.724
I was trying to help you!

08:21.569 --> 08:22.670
Fuck you!

08:34.514 --> 08:36.383
[glass breaking]

08:36.482 --> 08:37.985
[zapping]

08:43.456 --> 08:46.359
Uh.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.362
Uh, this is Cass
Coridore to Planet Snerd.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.464
The pilot's dead.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.533
I don't know how to fly a ship.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.435
The pilot's dead.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.171
It looks like his dick
has been eaten off.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.506
I didn't eat his dick off.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.575
I think the Chubbies
were the ones involved.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.076
They got loose.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.377
Uh, please send help.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.312
Send help.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.614
Help.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.482
Again, I did not
bite his dick off.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.851
It was not me.

09:10.951 --> 09:11.685
Help!

09:15.055 --> 09:15.956
Escape pod.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.209
Judge Enis.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.045
Oh, Judge Enis.

09:38.145 --> 09:38.879
Go away.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.447
I'm busy.

09:40.547 --> 09:44.384
Those little
creatures have escaped.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.687
I care not.

09:46.787 --> 09:51.324
They are en route
to Planet Earth, oh.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.159
Oh!

09:55.262 --> 09:56.764
Get me the General.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.799
The Chubbies must be destroyed.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.701
The Chubbies must be destroyed!

10:18.385 --> 10:21.889
[music playing]

12:10.898 --> 12:14.401
[indistinct chatter]

12:33.620 --> 12:34.354
Sam.

12:34.454 --> 12:35.522
Sam, come here.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.624
I want you to check
this video out.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.760
I found this brand
new video store.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.263
They rent foreign imports.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.364
What?
Seriously?

12:44.464 --> 12:45.565
Yeah, yeah.

12:45.665 --> 12:46.599
I got it queued up
to the best spot.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.368
I heard it's banned in America.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.803
[scream]

12:49.903 --> 12:54.341
And now, I'm going to
squirt my first load at you.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.675
[scream]

12:55.775 --> 12:57.710
What is this?

12:57.811 --> 12:59.012
What the bowling ball is this?

12:59.112 --> 12:59.779
I know.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.648
This is disgusting, Eddie.

13:01.748 --> 13:02.916
Why are we watching this?

13:03.016 --> 13:04.217
What the hell are
you guys doing?

13:04.317 --> 13:05.018
Moody's still here.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.053
Just watching a video, man.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.087
Moody doesn't like this crap.

13:07.187 --> 13:07.988
Oh my god.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.290
Tom, get your ass in here.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.124
Shit.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.830
MOODY (ON TV): Welcome
to Moody's Bowl-O-Rama!

13:20.200 --> 13:22.302
We have more balls
than any other bowling

13:22.402 --> 13:24.471
alley in the state.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.738
Bowling's not your game?

13:25.839 --> 13:26.806
Try pocket pool.

13:29.609 --> 13:34.614
Hey, kids, we have video games
like Ms. Pac-Man and Caligula.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.149
[knock on door]

13:37.951 --> 13:40.587
Uh, you wanted to
see me, Mr. Moody?

13:40.687 --> 13:42.189
MOODY (ON TV): We have new Coke.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.790
Tom.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.059
Have a seat.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.727
Would you care for
a piece of candy?

13:47.827 --> 13:48.862
Uh, no.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.230
I think I'll pass.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.564
[chuckle]

13:51.664 --> 13:53.366
Now, as you know,
it's Halloween.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.702
So I have to get the
fuck out of here,

13:55.802 --> 13:58.038
and I'm leaving you in charge.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.207
Well, I'm honored you
trust me so much, Mr. Moody.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.474
I don't.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.810
But you're a little less
retarded than the other idiots

14:03.911 --> 14:05.545
I have working here.

14:05.645 --> 14:06.779
Thanks all the same.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.182
Now, I know I don't
need to remind you,

14:09.282 --> 14:12.119
but if you or if any of
your little faggot friends

14:12.219 --> 14:15.989
are in here past midnight,
you'll be locked in until I

14:16.089 --> 14:17.090
come back in the morning.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.258
Don't worry, Mr. Moody.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.893
We'll be out of
here by 11:00 tops.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.962
Good, because I'll be
setting the security

14:22.062 --> 14:23.163
system when I leave.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.001
This sweet baby cost
me an arm and a leg.

14:28.101 --> 14:31.171
State of the art in bowling
alley security systems.

14:31.271 --> 14:36.509
[beeping] I've got lasers on
every door and every window.

14:36.609 --> 14:41.181
Guaranteed to keep the
darkies out after dark.

14:41.281 --> 14:45.118
Once I put the code in this
baby, we're on lockdown.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.519
Well, don't worry, Mr. Moody.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.456
You can count on me.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.424
[beeping]

15:03.403 --> 15:04.504
Well?

15:04.604 --> 15:07.274
Get the hell out of here
and run my bowling alley.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.210
I have got treats to pass
out to the little kiddies.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.044
Yes, sir.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.246
Uh, Happy Halloween, Mr. Moody.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.647
You fucker.

15:18.618 --> 15:19.786
So long, Mr. Moody.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.054
Happy Halloween, pricks.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.426
I've never seen Moody
leave so quickly.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.161
Yeah, or happy.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.062
Ever.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.230
Moody hates kids.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.065
Why is he so excited
for Halloween?

15:32.165 --> 15:33.766
Because Halloween
is the one day a year

15:33.866 --> 15:35.035
he can fuck with the
neighborhood kids

15:35.135 --> 15:36.436
and get away with it.
-Some beer.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.071
The kids, they think
they're going to prank him,

15:38.171 --> 15:40.473
but he always booby
traps his own yard.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.210
The other year, some kids were
going to egg his front porch.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.478
But he built this
see-through trampoline thing

15:45.578 --> 15:47.114
that shot the eggs
back, so the kids

15:47.214 --> 15:48.615
ended up egging themselves.
-Beer!

15:48.715 --> 15:50.650
And then the next year, they
were going to TP that tree

15:50.750 --> 15:52.152
he has in his front yard.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.221
But he spent the entire year
filling the tree with bats

15:54.321 --> 15:56.456
that he trained to attack at
the sight of toilet paper.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.324
Fuck.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.725
Yeah.

15:58.825 --> 16:02.029
I heard he baked his own shit,
and then wrapped the turds up

16:02.129 --> 16:05.332
in Tootsie Roll wrappers.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.634
That is why he loves
Halloween, and tonight is

16:07.734 --> 16:09.202
the only night he leaves early.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.004
It's also the same reason we're
going to have the Halloween

16:11.104 --> 16:12.372
party here tonight.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.210
Get with the fucking beer.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.046
You want your damn beer?

16:19.146 --> 16:22.049
Here it comes.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.883
You want your fucking drink?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.218
Here's your fucking drink.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.324
Get the fuck out of my bar.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.792
Fuck!

16:32.892 --> 16:35.595
I'm soaking wet like
a squid's pussy.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.963
Ugh.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.565
Fuck!

16:38.665 --> 16:42.335
I think I'm in love.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.437
That chick would destroy you.

16:48.908 --> 16:51.244
Charlie, don't
smoke so much, man.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.913
Gotta save some for the party.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.582
Lay off me, baby.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.184
I had a bad day, you know?

16:57.284 --> 16:59.719
My old man's such a dick.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.088
He don't understand me.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.889
Won't you calm down?

17:02.989 --> 17:05.092
Let me take care
of you for a bit.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.226
Pfft, whatever.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.560
No one understands me.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.196
I understand you.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.165
You only understand
my fat wank.

17:16.935 --> 17:17.804
[unzipping]

17:19.472 --> 17:21.308
[moan]

17:21.407 --> 17:22.108
Man.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.776
My old man is such a dick.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.680
You know, every day, he asks me,
are you going to the Halloween

17:27.780 --> 17:29.249
party today, son?

17:29.349 --> 17:31.984
He thinks it's a real
laugh riot the way I dress.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.253
Well, of all days
holy, you know what

17:33.353 --> 17:34.721
he says to me on Halloween?

17:34.821 --> 17:37.957
He says, are you going to
the library tonight, son,

17:38.057 --> 17:39.559
to do some studying?

17:39.659 --> 17:43.730
And I says to him, no, man, I'm
going to the Halloween party.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.765
What do you think about that?

17:45.865 --> 17:47.400
And you know what he says to me?

17:47.500 --> 17:48.568
Hm?

17:48.668 --> 17:51.571
He says, have fun studying
at the library, son.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.106
God, can you believe
that bullshit?

17:53.206 --> 17:54.641
[ufo zipping by overhead]

17:54.741 --> 17:55.975
Holy shit!

17:56.075 --> 17:57.310
-Are you about to come?
-No.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.345
Stop sucking my dick.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.880
Look, I just saw a UFO crash.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.482
[laugh]

18:02.582 --> 18:04.083
You are so high.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.386
I'm serious over here.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.921
Holy shit, there's another one.

18:09.021 --> 18:09.922
Come on, let's go check it out.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.524
No, I'm not finished.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.793
And we gotta go to
the Halloween party.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.061
You horny slut.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.563
Grab the video camera.
Come on.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.365
We'll tape this, and we'll
try selling it to the news.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.868
We can probably make like
$500, Maybe even more.

18:21.968 --> 18:22.769
Come on, let's go.

18:22.869 --> 18:23.603
Fine.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.511
[beeping]

18:31.611 --> 18:34.447
[coughing]

18:39.919 --> 18:42.222
This is Cass Coridore.

18:42.322 --> 18:46.058
I seem to have landed on
a Snerdian-like planet.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.994
Cass, this is General Teabag.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.829
Are the Chubbies with you?

18:49.929 --> 18:50.763
No.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.865
They escaped in a pod.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.234
They have to be destroyed.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.902
I am handling it, Melvin.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.541
Cass, I know you're just
a simple space lawyer,

19:01.641 --> 19:04.377
and you're just doing
your job, but trust me,

19:04.477 --> 19:06.979
those Chubbies are dangerous.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.581
How dangerous are they?

19:08.681 --> 19:11.784
Let's just say that
the people of Earth

19:11.884 --> 19:14.621
are a sexually driven species.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.155
The Chubbies know this.

19:16.256 --> 19:19.626
If they come in contact
with an Earth human,

19:19.726 --> 19:22.795
they can use their
body as an avatar

19:22.895 --> 19:25.798
by invading their anal cavity.

19:25.898 --> 19:29.536
Once inside, the Chubbies
take over their body

19:29.636 --> 19:32.472
and can even spawn
multiple Chubbies.

19:32.572 --> 19:38.878
If they succeed, they could
invade every Earth anus in less

19:38.978 --> 19:41.080
than two Snerdian weeks.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.082
Would you like some space tea?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.084
I'm a bit thirsty.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.653
Yes, that's fine.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.656
Dammit, Enis, I'm in the middle
of something important here.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.857
Well, my apologies.

19:50.957 --> 19:54.994
I'll, uh-- I'll get Rape
Bot to bring me some tea.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.530
Rape Bot, tea, please.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.602
How do I find them?

20:02.702 --> 20:06.205
Inside the escape pod should
be two fully charged space laser

20:06.306 --> 20:09.208
guns, and your communicator
doubles as a tracking

20:09.309 --> 20:11.911
device to locate them.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.447
It's quite simple, really.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.082
What's in this for me?

20:16.182 --> 20:18.017
Enis sent me to a prison camp.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.119
And I'll do it again,
you little shit!

20:20.219 --> 20:25.325
I outrank Enis on this planet.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.027
Cass, know that any
charges brought against you

20:28.127 --> 20:29.228
will be dropped.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.431
And then we will
send a ship to locate

20:31.531 --> 20:33.800
you and bring you back home.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.703
But only if you succeed.

20:36.803 --> 20:40.239
[mechanical whirring]

20:43.676 --> 20:44.944
Oh, oh, oh!

20:45.044 --> 20:46.513
Rape Bot, get off of me!

20:49.682 --> 20:50.750
Shit.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.051
Dammit, Enis.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.321
Why would you call in Rape
Bot to bring you space tea?

20:54.421 --> 20:58.358
I thought we reprogrammed
him to be our butler.

20:58.458 --> 21:02.729
Rape Bot has one job,
and business is good.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.865
Rape business.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.133
General.

21:07.233 --> 21:10.837
I'll do it.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.439
Don't let us down, Coridore.

21:12.539 --> 21:16.676
The fate of these two
planets depends on you.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.577
Keep us updated.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.939
[pew]

21:54.414 --> 21:55.915
CHARLIE: Come on, baby.
I don't want to argue.

21:56.015 --> 21:56.749
Just follow the smoke.

21:56.849 --> 21:57.917
We're almost there.

21:58.017 --> 21:58.918
RUTH ANNE: We're trespassing.

21:59.018 --> 21:59.886
CHARLIE: So what?

21:59.986 --> 22:02.689
We need the money anyway.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.291
You know, you really need
to start respecting me more.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.893
I'm out here, aren't I?

22:06.993 --> 22:08.294
Look, whatever, babe.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.562
Look, we're going
to make so much

22:09.662 --> 22:11.698
money off this stinkin' UFO.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.433
We're going to sell
it to the news, hell,

22:13.533 --> 22:15.034
maybe even "Time" magazine.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.670
And then I'll shove that video
in my old man's face and say,

22:17.770 --> 22:19.872
guess the world
digs my videos, Dad.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.874
Happy Halloween.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.276
Holy dog shit.

22:24.377 --> 22:25.277
Aha, you see?

22:25.378 --> 22:26.312
I told you there was a UFO.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.279
Go on, go on and start taping.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.314
Hold on.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.049
Let me get this thing working.

22:30.149 --> 22:34.020
Ruth Anne, I swear, if you
ruin this for me, I'll--

22:34.120 --> 22:34.854
[crunch]

22:34.954 --> 22:35.855
What, Charlie?

22:35.955 --> 22:37.857
You'll do what, huh?

22:37.957 --> 22:38.858
All right.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.326
It's working.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.128
Taking video now.

22:42.228 --> 22:44.731
Stop having a temper tantrum.

22:47.934 --> 22:48.668
Charlie?

22:52.271 --> 22:53.005
Charlie?

22:53.105 --> 22:54.006
Oh my god.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.007
Charlie?

22:55.107 --> 22:56.576
Charlie?

22:56.676 --> 22:57.577
Charlie?

22:57.677 --> 22:58.344
Charlie?

22:58.445 --> 23:01.080
[gurgling]

23:06.753 --> 23:08.020
[fart]

23:21.834 --> 23:23.503
I want to mostly
get Butterfingers

23:23.603 --> 23:25.505
because that's the best
candy in the world, you know?

23:25.605 --> 23:27.440
I can't believe that last
house gave us raisins.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.275
Who does that on Halloween?

23:29.375 --> 23:30.677
Stupid old people.

23:30.777 --> 23:31.878
For sure.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.514
I hate it also when they
like, serve granola bars.

23:34.614 --> 23:35.782
That's not candy.

23:35.882 --> 23:37.584
I know.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.952
Why aren't we
stopping here, guys?

23:40.052 --> 23:41.721
Dude, do you not know?

23:41.821 --> 23:43.590
That's Old Man Moody's house.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.091
Yeah, we don't
want to stop here.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.593
Hey, let's go across the street.

23:46.693 --> 23:49.395
There's a house that gives
away king-sized candy bars.

23:49.496 --> 23:50.897
You guys are being pussies.

23:50.997 --> 23:54.333
Halloween is about getting
the most free candy you can.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.135
It's not worth it, man.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.204
I'm not afraid
of some old dick.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.106
Just watch and learn.

24:08.347 --> 24:09.181
Trick or treat.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.551
Well, hello, little boy.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.185
And what are you supposed to be?

24:13.285 --> 24:14.854
A gay cheetah?

24:14.954 --> 24:15.488
No.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.156
I'm the Goblin King.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.258
Well, of course, you are.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.594
I haven't seen you
around here before.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.696
Are you all by yourself?

24:23.796 --> 24:25.364
My friends are on the sidewalk.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.099
Can we just get to the candy?

24:27.199 --> 24:32.071
Ah, is that little Johnny
Morgan and his brother Joey?

24:32.171 --> 24:33.105
Hello, boys.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.373
Happy Halloween.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.375
Piss off, Moody.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.746
Yes, piss indeed.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.081
I got something
for you, young man.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.587
See this football?

24:47.687 --> 24:50.056
This became mine when
your little friends kicked

24:50.156 --> 24:52.224
it into my yard last spring.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.926
I love it so much.

24:54.026 --> 24:57.129
I gave it to my kitty cat, Mr.
Rumsfeld, to use as a urinal.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.165
It's filled with cat piss.

24:59.265 --> 25:00.600
[splashing]

25:00.700 --> 25:02.635
There's even a couple of
Mr. Rumsfeld's little turds

25:02.735 --> 25:06.372
in there for your added
Halloween enjoyment.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.708
My candy's ruined!

25:08.808 --> 25:10.643
Happy Halloween,
you little shithead.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.244
Come back next year.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.646
You're all invited.

25:13.746 --> 25:16.115
Tell them Moody sent you.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.950
[laugh]

25:19.451 --> 25:21.320
Did you at least get
our football back?

25:21.420 --> 25:23.656
Screw you guys.

25:23.756 --> 25:26.826
[muffled music playing]

25:40.573 --> 25:43.876
Hello, Moody Jr.
Are you done yet?

25:43.976 --> 25:46.445
Everyone is almost
here for the party.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.814
Listen, you little faggot.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.716
I'm counting more
money here than you've

25:49.816 --> 25:51.183
ever seen in your life.

25:51.283 --> 25:56.022
Now get the fuck out of here,
but get me a beer first.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.825
We should just take
the money and run.

25:58.925 --> 26:02.028
I swear, that kind
of money, we could

26:02.128 --> 26:04.396
open up our own
bowling place and not

26:04.496 --> 26:06.498
have to answer to Moody.

26:06.599 --> 26:08.701
Where's my beer,
you little thief?

26:12.739 --> 26:14.073
What are you supposed to be?

26:14.173 --> 26:16.242
A gay swashbuckler?

26:16.342 --> 26:18.845
Uh, no.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.380
I'm obviously the Goblin King.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.414
You're kidding, right?

26:22.514 --> 26:23.783
I'm obviously the Goblin King.

26:31.223 --> 26:32.792
Hey, guys.
I could really use your help.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.593
People are starting to
show up for the party.

26:37.196 --> 26:42.401
So are you just going to
keep staring at my tits?

26:42.501 --> 26:43.369
I'm not.

26:43.469 --> 26:44.871
I mean-- shit, wait, what?

26:44.971 --> 26:46.505
People are here for
the party already?

26:46.605 --> 26:47.539
I didn't hear the bell.

26:47.640 --> 26:48.440
What door are they coming in?

26:48.540 --> 26:49.508
The back door.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.376
Shit!

26:54.146 --> 26:55.014
Hey, Sam.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.750
Uh-- nice costume.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.418
You too, Diamond Dave.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.020
Goblin King.

27:06.558 --> 27:07.293
You like my new tunes?

27:07.393 --> 27:08.560
I love them.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.629
You're so warm.

27:10.730 --> 27:11.698
I'm so cold right now.

27:11.798 --> 27:12.965
I'm such an idiot.

27:13.065 --> 27:15.501
I'm barely wearing
any clothes right now.

27:15.601 --> 27:16.602
I can warm you up.

27:16.703 --> 27:19.171
No problem.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.107
This door is off limits.

27:21.207 --> 27:21.941
Whoa.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.342
Sorry, dude.

27:23.442 --> 27:25.011
We saw the door was propped open
and decided to come this way.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.313
Seriously, we have to
leave it open at all times.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.480
Why?

27:28.580 --> 27:29.782
Because Moody has
a lockdown time,

27:29.882 --> 27:31.718
and it goes from
midnight to 8:00 AM.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.953
And if this door's
closed at 11:49,

27:34.053 --> 27:36.188
we're not opening it at 12:01.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.257
So whatever you need to
do, we can't get back in.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.191
You can't go to your car.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.326
You can't go to smoke.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.829
You can't do anything
until we all leave, OK?

27:42.929 --> 27:44.363
What are you
talking about, dude?

27:44.463 --> 27:48.801
Nobody's going outside to
smoke when we have the inside.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.169
That's fucking stupid.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.771
I'm being serious, guys.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.776
OK, dude, we got it.

27:56.876 --> 28:00.579
Don't close this door.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.848
OK, now let's go party.

28:01.948 --> 28:02.481
Yes.

28:02.581 --> 28:04.283
Party time.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.818
Fine.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.086
I guess I'll stay here and
make a sign for the stragglers.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.197
[music playing]

28:32.278 --> 28:35.181
[groaning]

30:23.923 --> 30:28.027
CHUBBY: Hey, it's
dark in here. [laugh]

30:46.445 --> 30:47.713
Hey, hey, hey.

30:47.813 --> 30:50.983
Have you guys seen
a Chubby tonight?

30:51.083 --> 30:53.252
What the fuck did you
just say to my kids?

30:53.352 --> 30:57.089
I'm just asking them if
they've seen a Chubby.

30:57.189 --> 31:00.692
You're asking my kids if
they've seen your chubby?

31:00.792 --> 31:01.627
Well, no.

31:01.727 --> 31:02.995
It's not my Chubbies.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.964
I mean, I did try to
get the Chubbies off.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.299
But now, I understand
how dangerous they are.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.201
Listen, pal, you're
cruising for a bruising.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.938
Hey, I'm just looking out
for you people of Earth.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.773
The Chubbies are here to
invade your anal cavity.

31:14.873 --> 31:15.707
That's it, pal.

31:15.807 --> 31:16.542
[thud]

31:17.944 --> 31:19.545
All right, let's get
the fuck out of here.

31:25.751 --> 31:26.585
[knock on door]

31:26.685 --> 31:27.419
Trick or treat.

31:29.956 --> 31:32.358
Well, if it isn't little
Timmy from next door.

31:32.458 --> 31:36.262
I've got something
really special for you.

31:36.362 --> 31:39.465
I made these little treats
with help of your doggie

31:39.565 --> 31:43.135
who likes to take dumps
on my lawn every day.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.004
Make sure you share
them with your parents.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.438
Thank you, Mr. Moody.

31:46.538 --> 31:47.839
Oh, you're welcome.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.609
You enjoy those Tootsie Poops.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.444
I mean, Pops.

31:52.544 --> 31:53.980
[laugh]

32:00.852 --> 32:02.754
Trick or treat.

32:02.854 --> 32:06.492
Well, aren't you a
pretty little princess?

32:06.592 --> 32:07.359
And who's this?

32:07.459 --> 32:09.128
Wonder Woman?

32:09.228 --> 32:14.600
Well, girls, I'm sorry, but
Old Moody's all out of treats.

32:14.700 --> 32:18.637
But I do have a trick.

32:18.737 --> 32:21.107
[screaming]

32:22.274 --> 32:24.876
Happy Halloween,
you little brats.

32:24.977 --> 32:27.746
Come back and see
Moody again next year.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.381
A nice little treat for me?

32:29.481 --> 32:32.484
Don't mind if I do.

32:32.584 --> 32:36.955
Ah, another successful
Halloween for Mr. Moody.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.093
[meow]

32:41.193 --> 32:44.230
Well, let's see what's
on the old boob tube.

32:56.542 --> 32:59.678
[banjo playing on tv]

33:02.414 --> 33:06.518
Halloween only
comes once a year.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.454
Kind of like Mr. Moody.

33:08.554 --> 33:14.326
You're not scared, 'cause I'm
Sheriff motherfucking Gary.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.328
[gunshots]

33:29.941 --> 33:33.379
[music playing]

34:56.828 --> 34:59.265
Shouldn't Charlie and
Ruth Anne be here by now?

34:59.365 --> 35:02.301
They're probably at Make Out
Point getting high right now.

35:02.401 --> 35:05.171
Or Charlie got
grounded by his pops.

35:05.271 --> 35:06.172
No way, man.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.439
Mr. Brewster's the coolest.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.641
I don't know why Charlie
hates him so much.

35:09.741 --> 35:14.112
(MOCKING) 'Cause my old man
just don't understand me, man.

35:14.213 --> 35:15.113
Fuck you.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.715
[laughter]

35:20.586 --> 35:26.925
General, the President of the
United States on Earth in 1986

35:27.025 --> 35:31.263
is on the space communicator.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.632
Oh, mother of Snerd.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.267
Fork down, Enis.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.769
I have a long rapport
with all the world

35:37.869 --> 35:40.138
leaders of Planet Earth.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.473
Put him through.

35:41.573 --> 35:44.476
[static]

35:45.377 --> 35:48.747
Mr. President, salutations.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.216
Just level with me.

35:50.316 --> 35:51.517
Just level with me.

35:51.617 --> 35:53.552
I don't want to forget to duck.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.721
Is there any truth
to the Chubbies

35:55.821 --> 35:59.124
invading-- invading
our beautiful country

35:59.225 --> 36:01.927
in a thousand points of light?

36:02.027 --> 36:03.962
Yes, Mr. President, it is true.

36:04.062 --> 36:08.634
But we have one of our best
on a kill-all mission, so--

36:08.734 --> 36:12.771
Good god, General, don't you
know that I've got a lot to do?

36:12.871 --> 36:16.742
We've got to punish those
homosexuals for getting AIDS,

36:16.842 --> 36:19.411
and we've got the War
on Drugs, General.

36:19.511 --> 36:23.415
I can't go around worrying
about an invasion-- an invasion.

36:23.515 --> 36:27.553
Please, Mr. Mars Man,
tear down that satellite.

36:27.653 --> 36:30.256
Do not stress about
this, Mr. President.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.723
It'll get done.

36:31.823 --> 36:35.294
The three Chubbies will be
disintegrated in no time.

36:35.394 --> 36:39.298
Well, I'd hate to
end our trade deal.

36:39.398 --> 36:42.934
I just love-- I love all
those Snerdian jelly beans.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.337
Yeah, so does Nancy.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.707
And, you know, we do
love your enriched uranium

36:48.807 --> 36:50.041
and your nerve gas.

36:50.141 --> 36:54.112
Oh, also oxygen. Yes, we cannot
live without that oxygen,

36:54.212 --> 36:56.948
so, yeah, keep that coming.

36:57.048 --> 36:57.849
Very good, General.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.951
And God bless America.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.553
God bless Reaganomics.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.956
And did you get a chance to look
at those videotapes I sent you?

37:07.926 --> 37:09.661
Videotapes?

37:09.761 --> 37:10.562
Uh.

37:10.662 --> 37:11.930
Oh!

37:12.030 --> 37:16.968
Yes, the Hollywood movies
featuring you and a monkey.

37:17.068 --> 37:17.869
Yes.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.605
Yes, that's it.

37:19.705 --> 37:20.706
Yes, that's it.

37:20.806 --> 37:22.908
President Nixon and I
watched it together.

37:23.008 --> 37:28.079
We were on our knees,
praying the whole time.

37:28.179 --> 37:29.315
[awkward laugh]

37:29.415 --> 37:32.284
Remarkable work, sir.

37:32.384 --> 37:34.320
It's no wonder the
people of America

37:34.420 --> 37:38.223
have elected you to
be the supreme leader.

37:38.324 --> 37:39.958
Yes, there are
plenty more videotapes

37:40.058 --> 37:41.159
where that came from, General.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.362
But you need to
return them tomorrow

37:43.462 --> 37:46.798
because I've got to send
them back to the Pentagon.

37:46.898 --> 37:50.869
Their video collection is
much in demand these days.

37:50.969 --> 37:57.509
Big missiles and heat-seeking,
wet, lushness, hard missiles.

37:59.745 --> 38:00.479
Yeah.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.182
You know--

38:04.282 --> 38:06.552
Uh-- I-- I believe Rape Bot is
still watching them right now.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.320
I think Rape Bot is still
watching them right now.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.220
Hold on one second.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.221
Let me find out.

38:10.322 --> 38:11.623
I'll call him.
Rape Bot?

38:11.723 --> 38:13.024
Rape Bot, can you bring
us the President's films?

38:13.124 --> 38:15.527
Could you bring in the
President's films for us,

38:15.627 --> 38:16.294
please?

38:16.395 --> 38:19.431
[mechanical whirring]

38:22.801 --> 38:27.906
Rape Bot, what have you done
with the President's films?

38:28.006 --> 38:30.709
I have repeatedly raped them.

38:35.947 --> 38:36.682
Oh!

38:36.782 --> 38:37.315
Oh!

38:37.416 --> 38:39.184
Get off of me!

38:39.284 --> 38:42.053
Get off of me!

38:42.153 --> 38:43.254
Dammit!

38:43.355 --> 38:46.692
[moaning]

38:47.959 --> 38:49.395
Kill all the homos.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.096
Kill them, kill them all.

38:51.196 --> 38:52.631
They got AIDS as punishment.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.265
That's what it's all about.

38:54.366 --> 38:57.135
God is punishing the
bad people, including

38:57.235 --> 39:00.105
those interstellar Chubbies.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.974
[moaning]

39:04.443 --> 39:06.645
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this, General.

39:06.745 --> 39:09.080
That's probably because
I got Alzheimer's and I

39:09.180 --> 39:12.418
can't stop farting. [fart]
But Nancy likes the farting.

39:12.518 --> 39:15.587
[fart] And one more
thing, General,

39:15.687 --> 39:17.155
destroy those Chubbies.

39:17.255 --> 39:18.557
Oh, yeah.

39:18.657 --> 39:22.127
Chubbies delenda est. Yeah.

39:22.227 --> 39:22.961
Yeah.

39:25.497 --> 39:26.965
Yes, yes, yes.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.067
Right away, Mr. President.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.035
Right away, sir.

39:37.142 --> 39:38.209
Dammit, Enis.

39:38.309 --> 39:42.581
Why is Rape Bot
still on this ship?

39:42.681 --> 39:45.951
Rape Bot can take a hint.

39:46.051 --> 39:49.154
[mechanical whirring]

39:54.893 --> 39:58.830
You know, you just hurt
Rape Bot's feelings.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.353
Hey, man.

40:22.454 --> 40:23.489
This is awesome.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.991
We have to have
more parties here.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.594
Well, yeah, sure.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.028
And I went to the
doctor, and it ends

40:30.128 --> 40:32.998
up I wasn't pregnant after all.

40:33.098 --> 40:36.334
You know, I think I'm ready
to make a move on Samantha.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.669
[groan]

40:37.769 --> 40:39.538
You sure you want
to do that, boss?

40:39.638 --> 40:41.607
I mean, when she
turns you down, it's

40:41.707 --> 40:43.108
going to be awkward at work.

40:46.578 --> 40:47.679
Thank you.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.180
Cheers.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.015
All right.

40:55.487 --> 40:58.957
I thought about that, but it's
a chance I'm willing to take.

40:59.057 --> 41:04.462
Well, if she says yes and
becomes your girl or whatever,

41:04.563 --> 41:07.533
I'm going to feel
real guilty every time

41:07.633 --> 41:10.435
I masturbate to the thought
of her luscious tits.

41:10.536 --> 41:12.871
I mean, she's the
girl for me, I know it.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.172
I'm 17 years old.

41:14.272 --> 41:15.941
Next year, I'm going to college.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.943
I don't want to spend the
rest of my life regretting

41:18.043 --> 41:19.511
not asking her out.

41:19.611 --> 41:22.013
Well, with any luck,
you won't have to leave

41:22.113 --> 41:24.082
this place a virgin, huh?

41:24.182 --> 41:24.916
Cheers.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.222
Hey, Sam.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.323
You got a minute?

41:32.423 --> 41:33.158
Yeah.

41:45.203 --> 41:46.638
Thank you so much.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.374
That was by far the dumbest
conversation I've ever had.

41:49.474 --> 41:50.441
So what's up?

41:50.542 --> 41:53.244
I-- I just wanted to say hi.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.913
Um, hi.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.014
Hi.

41:56.114 --> 41:58.249
Uh, I mean, are you
having fun at the party?

41:58.349 --> 42:02.253
Yeah, it's pretty rad, but
I could be a lot drunker.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.723
So is something on your mind?

42:04.823 --> 42:06.291
Yeah, you know,
we've been working

42:06.391 --> 42:09.761
together for the past year and
hanging out a lot at school.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.563
It's just been really
cool getting to know you.

42:11.663 --> 42:13.064
You're pretty cool too, Tom.

42:13.164 --> 42:15.333
Most guys really
just want to fuck me.

42:15.433 --> 42:16.902
[awkward laugh]

42:18.336 --> 42:20.972
Well, Samantha, you know,
being around you just kind of

42:21.072 --> 42:23.041
makes me feel like
a kid at Christmas.

42:23.141 --> 42:25.043
You see a preview for
a toy you want on TV.

42:25.143 --> 42:27.045
You just see the
commercial over and over.

42:27.145 --> 42:29.214
And then Christmas comes, and
you see the box under the tree.

42:29.314 --> 42:31.883
It's the same size and
shape of the toy you want.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.418
But you don't want to
wait until Christmas.

42:33.518 --> 42:35.286
Yeah, so you open
it before Christmas

42:35.386 --> 42:36.187
just to see what it is.

42:36.287 --> 42:37.522
Exactly.

42:37.623 --> 42:40.325
So with that in mind, I
just want to tell you--

42:46.998 --> 42:49.500
Charlie, Ruth Anne,
it's about time.

42:49.601 --> 42:51.036
We were worried about you.

42:51.136 --> 42:52.170
You guys are so lucky.

42:52.270 --> 42:56.141
This place is going on
shut down in 15 minutes.

42:56.241 --> 42:57.042
Holy shit.

43:00.445 --> 43:02.948
You guys are so high.

43:07.552 --> 43:10.188
Party.

43:10.288 --> 43:11.522
Fuck yeah, I want to party.

43:11.623 --> 43:12.824
Let's spark it.

43:15.661 --> 43:18.797
Hey, were we done
talking about Christmas?

43:18.897 --> 43:20.632
Uh, yeah, that's all.

43:20.732 --> 43:22.701
All right, cool.

43:22.801 --> 43:25.470
Hm, pussed out, didn't you?

43:25.570 --> 43:26.638
Buzz off.

43:30.308 --> 43:31.409
[banjo playing on tv]

43:31.509 --> 43:32.443
MAN (ON TV): Help
me, Sheriff Gary.

43:32.543 --> 43:33.411
Help me.

43:33.511 --> 43:36.247
[laugh]

43:36.347 --> 43:37.749
[meow]

43:37.849 --> 43:42.187
Oh, he really got him good
that time, eh, Mr. Rumsfeld?

43:42.287 --> 43:43.221
Rumsy, where are you?

43:43.321 --> 43:44.322
You're missing this good movie.

43:48.493 --> 43:51.529
GARY (ON TV): I'll shoot
you right now, motherfucker.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.665
[gunshots]

43:55.433 --> 43:58.003
Hushed up another one, Moody.

43:58.103 --> 44:01.673
You're still the big dick
shit kicker you always were.

44:01.773 --> 44:03.942
GARY (ON TV): Now don't be
afraid now, little lady.

44:04.042 --> 44:07.278
Why don't you just come over
here and give me a kiss?

44:07.378 --> 44:09.981
Oh, watch out now. [gunshots]

44:11.349 --> 44:13.418
Good movie, eh, Mr. Rumsfeld?

44:13.518 --> 44:16.688
GARY (ON TV): I've taken
out every goon from El Paso

44:16.788 --> 44:19.157
to Del Rey.

44:19.257 --> 44:20.125
[crash]

44:20.225 --> 44:21.092
What the fuck?

44:25.997 --> 44:27.999
What in the hell is going on?

44:28.099 --> 44:30.601
I'm trying to have a nice,
peaceful evening on Halloween,

44:30.702 --> 44:33.071
and there's all
this-- what is this?

44:36.341 --> 44:37.075
Cum?

44:41.446 --> 44:44.049
There's faggots in my house.

44:44.149 --> 44:45.050
Fucking faggots.

44:45.150 --> 44:46.918
I've got a Louisville
slugger here,

44:47.018 --> 44:49.487
and I will shove it right
up your faggoty asses.

44:49.587 --> 44:50.956
Wouldn't you like that?

44:51.056 --> 44:52.690
Show yourselves, faggots.

44:52.791 --> 44:53.892
Where are you?

45:00.365 --> 45:01.867
Holy fuck!

45:05.103 --> 45:07.672
Get back here, shit heel.

45:07.773 --> 45:08.506
Where'd you go?

45:08.606 --> 45:10.108
Where are you?

45:10.208 --> 45:14.679
Show your slimy little ass so I
can blast you into outer space.

45:14.780 --> 45:16.647
Well, hello.

45:16.748 --> 45:20.051
And goodbye, tiny faggot.

45:20.151 --> 45:21.719
[thud]

45:21.820 --> 45:24.122
Oh, you little bastard.

45:24.222 --> 45:26.124
[laugh]

45:33.198 --> 45:36.467
Mr. Rumsfeld!

45:36.567 --> 45:41.039
Why didn't you meow to me?

45:41.139 --> 45:44.042
[sobbing]

45:56.855 --> 46:00.325
Where'd you go,
you little faggot?

46:00.425 --> 46:01.492
Where are you?

46:01.592 --> 46:02.928
You can't hide from
Moody very long.

46:07.833 --> 46:08.934
[crunch]

46:09.034 --> 46:11.302
Oh!

46:11.402 --> 46:13.138
Oh, no, you don't.

46:13.238 --> 46:19.644
Get out of my ass, you
little fucking dick.

46:19.744 --> 46:23.181
Get out of my ass.

46:23.281 --> 46:24.549
I'll shit you out.

46:27.618 --> 46:30.521
Nobody fucks Moody.

46:30.621 --> 46:36.494
[grunting] [farting]

46:37.595 --> 46:41.499
Get out of my ass, demon!

I'm a faggot!

[thud]

47:46.197 --> 47:48.033
Did you just hear something?

47:48.133 --> 47:52.170
It was probably the
sound of my beating heart.

47:52.270 --> 47:53.905
What?

47:54.005 --> 47:55.040
Nothing, nothing.

47:55.140 --> 47:56.107
Do you want another beer?

48:08.553 --> 48:11.056
[beeping]

48:43.854 --> 48:45.523
[scream]

48:45.623 --> 48:46.357
Whoa!

48:46.457 --> 48:47.758
Whoa, man.

48:47.858 --> 48:49.927
This is like, a private party.

48:50.028 --> 48:51.329
Whoa, man.
Put the gun down.

48:51.429 --> 48:52.163
You're safe.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.731
Everything's fine, right, guys?

48:53.831 --> 48:54.599
Yeah, it's cool.

48:54.699 --> 48:56.367
It's cool.

48:56.467 --> 48:57.602
[gurgling]

48:57.702 --> 48:59.437
Whoa, what-- Charlie?

[pew]

49:11.449 --> 49:12.950
[explosion]

49:20.125 --> 49:22.560
Hold still, you psycho.

49:22.660 --> 49:23.561
Someone grab his gun.

49:23.661 --> 49:24.895
Sam, get some rope.

49:24.996 --> 49:25.796
CASS: Get off me!

49:25.896 --> 49:27.865
There's more Chubbies!

49:27.965 --> 49:31.069
I told you to shut up, man.

49:31.169 --> 49:32.270
Get him in the chair.

49:39.110 --> 49:41.579
[squirming]

49:57.728 --> 49:58.863
What the fuck, man.

49:58.963 --> 50:00.365
This guy just blew
Charlie's head off.

50:00.465 --> 50:03.568
I got Charlie's blood all
over my fucking boom box.

50:03.668 --> 50:04.969
God dammit, Wendel.

50:05.070 --> 50:06.671
Who gives a fuck about
your stupid ass boom box?

50:06.771 --> 50:08.139
Put it down and help us.

50:11.876 --> 50:13.778
Who the hell is this guy?

50:13.878 --> 50:14.779
I don't know.

50:14.879 --> 50:15.946
I've never seen him before.

50:16.047 --> 50:17.215
How the hell did
he get in here?

50:17.315 --> 50:19.717
I thought the doors
locked at midnight.

50:19.817 --> 50:21.752
They were-- oh, shit.

50:28.659 --> 50:30.128
No, no, no, no, no!

50:52.217 --> 50:53.751
What is it?

50:53.851 --> 50:55.019
We're locked in.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.221
He locked us in.

51:01.692 --> 51:02.660
Let's just call the cops.

51:02.760 --> 51:03.528
OK.

51:11.869 --> 51:13.738
[chomping]

51:20.211 --> 51:22.947
You guys, the phone
lines are down.

51:23.047 --> 51:23.781
Fuck it.

51:23.881 --> 51:24.782
Break a window.

51:24.882 --> 51:26.284
We can't.

51:26.384 --> 51:28.619
Moody just installed triple
bulletproof glass windows.

51:28.719 --> 51:29.987
Oh, dammit.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.923
Yep, we're fucked.

51:33.023 --> 51:34.192
This fucking place.

51:34.292 --> 51:36.060
Moody's going to kill me.

51:36.161 --> 51:38.028
You need to calm down
too, all right, Tom?

51:38.129 --> 51:39.230
I don't think I can.

51:39.330 --> 51:40.531
There's blood everywhere.

51:40.631 --> 51:41.799
Charlie's dead.

51:41.899 --> 51:43.100
There's no way out.

51:43.201 --> 51:44.369
I've never had an
anxiety attack,

51:44.469 --> 51:45.936
but I'm pretty sure
I'm having one now.

51:46.036 --> 51:49.340
I think this is
what it feels like.

51:49.440 --> 51:50.841
Samantha, I love you.

51:50.941 --> 51:52.009
I don't mean to
say it like this,

51:52.109 --> 51:53.644
but I'm pretty sure
we're all dying.

51:53.744 --> 51:55.880
I just love you, and I want
you to know that, all right?

51:55.980 --> 51:56.714
[smack]

51:56.814 --> 51:59.917
Calm the fuck down.

52:00.017 --> 52:01.152
Thank you.

52:01.252 --> 52:04.989
We all need to
calm the fuck down.

52:05.089 --> 52:09.760
Ruth Anne, she looks kind of
collected for her boyfriend

52:09.860 --> 52:11.862
just getting shot in the face.

52:11.962 --> 52:14.064
Well, he was kind of a dick.

52:14.165 --> 52:15.633
Focus up.

52:15.733 --> 52:19.537
Does anyone have like,
a satellite phone?

52:19.637 --> 52:22.006
Oh, yeah, but I left it
out in my $20,000 Corvette.

52:22.106 --> 52:22.840
Who do you think I am?

52:22.940 --> 52:23.974
Daddy Warbucks?

52:24.074 --> 52:27.111
I'm just asking, Wendel.

52:27.212 --> 52:28.679
I have to destroy the Chubbies.

52:31.449 --> 52:36.120
Excuse me, who are you, and why
the fuck did you kill Charlie?

52:36.221 --> 52:37.355
That wasn't your friend.

52:37.455 --> 52:38.889
He was invaded by a Chubby.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.825
I'm going to kick
this guy's butt.

52:40.925 --> 52:42.260
Wait.

52:42.360 --> 52:43.093
He's tied up.

52:43.194 --> 52:45.663
He can't hurt us.

52:45.763 --> 52:47.765
Who are you?

52:47.865 --> 52:49.334
My name's Cass Coridore.

52:49.434 --> 52:51.902
I'm from the Planet Snerd,
and I'm on a mission

52:52.002 --> 52:53.904
to track and kill the Chubbies.

52:54.004 --> 52:55.740
Let me go so I can do my job.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.242
Where's my space lasers?

52:57.342 --> 52:58.743
WENDEL: This guy is nuts.

52:58.843 --> 53:02.480
So you expect us to
believe that you're an alien

53:02.580 --> 53:05.182
chasing after other aliens?

53:05.283 --> 53:06.484
Give me a break, dude.

53:06.584 --> 53:08.753
If you're an alien,
why do you look like us?

53:08.853 --> 53:11.289
Planet Snerd has the
same molecular structure

53:11.389 --> 53:13.291
as your Planet Earth.

53:13.391 --> 53:14.592
We have a sun.

53:14.692 --> 53:18.963
We breathe oxygen. We
just don't have sex.

53:19.063 --> 53:20.731
It's been outlawed.

53:20.831 --> 53:25.035
So women are
artificially inseminated.

53:25.135 --> 53:26.471
WENDEL: So you don't fuck?

53:26.571 --> 53:28.373
No wonder this guy's a maniac.

53:28.473 --> 53:29.374
I don't like this.

53:29.474 --> 53:30.741
Let's just get out of here.

53:30.841 --> 53:33.844
Well, we could if
spaceman didn't lock us in.

53:33.944 --> 53:36.747
What are these Chubbies
you keep talking about?

53:36.847 --> 53:39.517
The Chubbies are
three awful creatures

53:39.617 --> 53:40.951
that were supposed
to go to a prison

53:41.051 --> 53:43.153
planet on my solar system.

53:43.254 --> 53:45.290
But they escaped.

53:45.390 --> 53:47.892
They are now on
your Planet Earth.

53:47.992 --> 53:52.430
And they want one thing and
one thing only-- to have sex.

53:52.530 --> 53:57.101
And the way they do that is
by invading another life form,

53:57.201 --> 53:59.169
like your friend Charlie.

53:59.270 --> 54:00.538
Once the Chubbies
are inside you,

54:00.638 --> 54:02.440
they will use your
body as a vehicle,

54:02.540 --> 54:07.044
and they will stop at
nothing to reproduce.

54:07.144 --> 54:10.014
I shot your friend
Charlie because he

54:10.114 --> 54:13.050
was infected with a Chubby.

54:13.150 --> 54:14.485
The Chubbies are
most dangerous when

54:14.585 --> 54:17.555
they're inside a female host.

54:17.655 --> 54:21.258
Once inside, they can use the
female reproductive organs

54:21.359 --> 54:26.130
to spawn multiple
Chubbies almost instantly.

54:26.230 --> 54:27.698
You have to believe me.

54:27.798 --> 54:30.535
Take my space lasers
and kill the other two.

54:30.635 --> 54:32.136
You don't know how
dangerous they are.

54:32.236 --> 54:33.504
I saw it firsthand.

54:33.604 --> 54:34.772
[smack]

54:35.573 --> 54:39.143
I had enough of his lip.

54:39.243 --> 54:40.277
Put him in the corner.

54:40.378 --> 54:41.779
We'll wait it out.

54:41.879 --> 54:45.115
Moody'll be here at 8:00 AM
to open the doors, right?

54:45.215 --> 54:46.984
Yeah.

54:47.084 --> 54:48.085
What about the Chubbies?

54:48.185 --> 54:49.119
I saw one.

54:49.219 --> 54:51.255
He might be telling the truth.

54:51.356 --> 54:52.423
Moody's going to kill me.

54:52.523 --> 54:54.291
He trusted me, and I failed him.

54:54.392 --> 54:56.494
Look, Tom, I'll take
the blame completely.

54:56.594 --> 55:00.865
We'll just say that this guy
came in and took us hostage,

55:00.965 --> 55:03.000
and we fought back.

55:03.100 --> 55:04.935
We'll be heroes,
and we'll probably

55:05.035 --> 55:06.771
be on the news and shit.

55:06.871 --> 55:09.306
Moody won't even
care in that case.

55:09.407 --> 55:12.142
It'll probably even give
him some free publicity.

55:12.242 --> 55:14.645
You'll take the blame?

55:14.745 --> 55:16.681
Skin it, man.

55:16.781 --> 55:18.349
What are you going
to do with the body?

55:26.023 --> 55:29.860
Oh, Rape Bot, would
you come here, please?

55:29.960 --> 55:33.330
[mechanical whirring]

55:36.767 --> 55:40.237
Rape Bot, I just wanted
to apologize for being

55:40.337 --> 55:41.472
so rude to you earlier.

55:41.572 --> 55:45.976
I-- I've been under
a lot of stress

55:46.076 --> 55:49.680
lately from these damn Chubbies.

55:49.780 --> 55:52.216
I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

55:52.316 --> 55:54.585
Rape Bot heard what you said.

55:54.685 --> 55:58.188
Perhaps a little
raping is in order.

55:58.288 --> 56:00.791
No, no, thank you.

56:00.891 --> 56:04.762
I just wanted to let you know
that you do a fine job here

56:04.862 --> 56:07.097
doing what you do.

56:07.197 --> 56:10.735
So, please, accept my apology.

56:10.835 --> 56:14.405
Rape Bot knows
not how to forgive.

56:14.505 --> 56:15.706
Only rape.

56:15.806 --> 56:18.075
Well, OK, that's fair enough.

56:20.878 --> 56:27.952
How about you get reprogrammed
to not just rape anymore?

56:28.052 --> 56:30.988
World would be destroyed.

56:31.088 --> 56:32.590
End of Rape Bot.

56:32.690 --> 56:34.559
Yes, yes, very true.

56:34.659 --> 56:37.495
But what if we
reprogrammed you into being

56:37.595 --> 56:39.329
something more
useful around here

56:39.430 --> 56:44.034
like a Chef Bot or a Garden Bot?

56:44.134 --> 56:45.836
Would you like that?

56:45.936 --> 56:49.607
You cannot change
what Rape Bot is.

56:49.707 --> 56:55.379
Rape Bot may not have feelings,
but it knows what it is.

56:55.480 --> 56:58.683
Rape Bot is done with you.

56:58.783 --> 57:01.619
Oh, Rape Bot,
don't be like that.

57:01.719 --> 57:05.422
Rape Bot said it
is done with you.

57:05.523 --> 57:08.325
Enis, what are you doing?

57:08.425 --> 57:11.228
I was just apologizing
to Rape Bot here.

57:11.328 --> 57:13.397
Have you heard from Coridore?

57:13.498 --> 57:15.466
No, nothing from the
space communicator.

57:15.566 --> 57:18.335
Well, keep a Snerdian ear out.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.270
Let me know if
you hear anything.

57:20.370 --> 57:25.943
We have to get this done or our
planet is as good as extinct.

57:26.043 --> 57:28.646
Rape Bot will survive.

57:28.746 --> 57:31.582
It needs not oxygen.

57:31.682 --> 57:36.053
That was a low blow,
Rape Bot, even for you.

57:36.153 --> 57:37.688
Suck my parts, Enis.

57:58.042 --> 58:02.112
Look, I want you to know how
unrealistic your story sounds.

58:02.212 --> 58:05.282
But I do admit something fucked
up is going on here tonight.

58:05.382 --> 58:07.017
Will you just untie me?

58:07.117 --> 58:08.986
I'm not a bad guy.

58:09.086 --> 58:09.987
Oh yeah?

58:10.087 --> 58:12.289
What do you do on
your planet, Cass?

58:12.389 --> 58:13.390
I'm a lawyer.

58:13.490 --> 58:14.424
[laugh]

58:14.525 --> 58:15.893
So that makes you a good guy?

58:15.993 --> 58:17.862
I was the Chubbies'
defense attorney.

58:17.962 --> 58:20.197
I believe in giving
everyone a fair trial,

58:20.297 --> 58:21.899
whether they deserve it or not.

58:21.999 --> 58:26.537
If you defend them, why
are you trying to kill them?

58:26.637 --> 58:29.239
I didn't realize how
terrible they were.

58:29.339 --> 58:33.678
I was on the ship with them when
they were being transported.

58:33.778 --> 58:37.314
This was all my
fault. I was the one

58:37.414 --> 58:40.651
who freed them because I thought
it was the right thing to do.

58:40.751 --> 58:43.020
But they murdered the
pilot on the ship,

58:43.120 --> 58:45.556
and then they
tried to murder me.

58:45.656 --> 58:47.792
Now, I'm just trying
to fix my wrong.

58:47.892 --> 58:49.627
Please, you have to let me.

58:49.727 --> 58:51.662
Do you know how
crazy that sounds?

58:51.762 --> 58:53.197
Look, if you don't
believe me, then just

58:53.297 --> 58:55.465
keep me tied up to this chair.

58:55.566 --> 58:59.637
But your friend is infected, and
there's another Chubby loose.

58:59.737 --> 59:02.907
Take my space laser and shoot
them before it's too late

59:03.007 --> 59:05.876
and others die.

59:05.976 --> 59:07.678
Hey, is it true that
you shit yourself

59:07.778 --> 59:11.749
a half hour after you die?

59:11.849 --> 59:12.883
I don't know, Wendel.

59:12.983 --> 59:14.251
Why don't you check
Charlie's shorts

59:14.351 --> 59:15.986
for some Hershey's syrup?

59:16.086 --> 59:19.523
You guys, I'm seriously
worried about Ruth Anne.

59:19.624 --> 59:21.626
She's just walking
around like a zombie.

59:21.726 --> 59:24.528
I don't even think
I've seen her blink.

59:24.629 --> 59:26.363
She's-- she's probably
going through a grieving

59:26.463 --> 59:28.065
process or something.

59:28.165 --> 59:29.667
I don't know.

59:29.767 --> 59:32.402
Ruth Anne, are you OK?

59:32.502 --> 59:36.006
[music playing]

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.783
Oh my god, what a slut.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.403
[crunching]

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.375
[splashing]

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:20.544
Whoa!

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:21.378
Whoa!

01:01:30.454 --> 01:01:31.956
[scream]

01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:37.227
Oh my god, one of those
things is inside of me.

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:37.995
I can't get pregnant.

01:01:38.095 --> 01:01:40.230
My dad's going to kill me.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.231
Fuck.

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:42.199
No.

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:44.802
[sobbing]

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:50.775
[pew]

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:54.011
-What the fuck was that?
-You see?

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:54.979
Untie me.

01:02:18.803 --> 01:02:20.304
Fuck.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.305
No!

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:22.272
[pew]

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:23.908
[explosion]

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:29.146
All right, Earth
kids, listen up.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:32.049
That was a Chubby.

01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:34.118
That is what invaded
your friends.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:40.290
I'm not here to hurt any of you.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.492
I just want to kill
those fuck twerps so I

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.395
can get back to my home planet.

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:49.633
As far as I see it, you
can do one of two things--

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:56.273
help me destroy those creatures
or get the Snerd out of my way.

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.875
What's it going to be?

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:05.115
Yeah, we'll help.

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:06.583
All right.

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:08.118
Now, take me around
this building

01:03:08.218 --> 01:03:11.521
so we can find those
Chubbies and destroy them.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.356
Let's move.

01:03:17.828 --> 01:03:21.298
[music playing]

01:04:21.825 --> 01:04:24.995
My space tracker
isn't reading anymore.

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:27.364
They could be anywhere.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:32.302
We should probably split
up, cover more ground.

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:33.370
Fine.

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:35.705
You three go over
there, get some weapons.

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:38.475
Sam and I will go through here.

01:04:38.575 --> 01:04:40.978
Hey, why is she going with you?

01:04:41.078 --> 01:04:43.147
Because she's the
only one I actually

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:45.649
trust with the space laser.

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:46.550
It's OK, Tom.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:47.551
I'm a big girl.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:52.156
Go.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:08.172
Whoa, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait a second.

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:10.207
That space dick wants us to
go look for the Chubbies,

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:11.775
but we don't even
have any weapons.

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:13.310
What are we going to
do when we find them?

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.181
I got mine.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:20.884
All right, let's go.

01:05:20.985 --> 01:05:22.619
Hold on, hold on.

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:25.189
I gotta go take
a bodacious dump.

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:26.523
All right, just hurry up.

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:27.824
When you're done, meet
us in Moody's office.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:28.892
All right, give me two minutes.

01:05:28.993 --> 01:05:29.960
Gotta grab my tunes too.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.395
All right, hurry up.

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:45.342
So do they really say
"get the Snerd out of here"

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:46.443
in your planet?

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:49.113
Snerds yeah.

01:05:49.213 --> 01:05:50.447
Oh, look at this.

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:51.348
It's stuck.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:52.182
CASS: Be careful.

01:05:59.123 --> 01:06:02.459
There's, um-- something
happening to me.

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.061
What's wrong?

01:06:04.161 --> 01:06:05.996
I don't know.

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:08.898
Maybe they invaded me
without me knowing.

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:10.267
What?

01:06:10.367 --> 01:06:13.070
There's, um--
something happening

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:16.506
to my urinal extractor.

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:18.308
You mean this?

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:20.110
Yes.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:22.679
Have you ever had
a boner before?

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:24.614
I-- I don't know.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:26.516
Have you ever had sex before?

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:27.451
No.

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:28.818
It's outlawed on Snerd.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:31.055
Plus, our Boner-Tron
anti-gravity pull

01:06:31.155 --> 01:06:33.757
won't allow us to even try.

01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:37.927
Have you ever
seen these before?

01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:39.796
I don't know what's
happening, but I

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:41.231
really want to grab those.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.267
Do it.

01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:46.636
Come on, spaceman, fuck me.

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:48.538
OK.

01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:50.540
[moaning]

01:06:55.979 --> 01:06:58.315
Fucking aliens killing my buzz.

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:12.662
Killed my girl.

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:17.801
Slimy bastards got in
her before I could.

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:24.040
She's dead.

01:07:24.141 --> 01:07:26.210
Charlie's dead.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:28.078
Ruth Anne's dead.

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:31.315
Got Charlie's fucking
brains all over my costume.

01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:36.052
This is the worst
Halloween party ever.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:41.291
Oh, man.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:47.364
Oh.

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:48.465
Oh.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:49.299
Oh, no.

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:52.736
Oh, shit.

01:07:52.836 --> 01:07:53.570
Oh, shit.

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:54.471
Oh, shit.

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:00.210
You know, I don't
trust that guy.

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:02.646
We should've never left
him alone with Samantha.

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:05.382
Look, you need to cut
that jibber jabber.

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:07.217
We have more important
things to worry

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:09.153
about, like not
getting our b-holes

01:08:09.253 --> 01:08:10.587
penetrated by those things.

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:13.056
Well, what are we going
to do when we do find them?

01:08:13.157 --> 01:08:14.724
Sweep them to death?

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.260
I don't know, Tom.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:19.662
This is my first encounter
with an alien life form.

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:22.299
Oh, is that candy?

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:22.966
No.

01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:24.434
[snap]

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.502
Ah!

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:27.371
Son of a bitch!

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:28.238
Ow!

01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:34.310
Yeah, Moody's an asshole.

01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:37.514
I just wish we had
some kind of weapons.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.816
What's in the box?

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:41.151
Let's find out.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.626
It's locked.

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:50.527
What are you doing?

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:51.361
No!

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:52.296
[crack]

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.698
Oh.

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:57.600
Holy shit.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:59.368
Fuck me.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.705
I knew Moody was paranoid, but--

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:03.640
Holy Macanoli!

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.910
Do you know how to
load one of those?

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.679
No.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:10.514
BOTH: Wendel.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.416
His pops was a deputy sheriff.

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.618
I'm sure he showed him how
to use one of those before.

01:09:14.718 --> 01:09:15.252
TOM: You're right.

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:16.185
EDDIE: Where is he?

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:18.622
[door creaking]

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:23.026
Oh, speak of the devil.

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:24.461
Hey, man, can you--

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.095
[groaning]

01:09:26.196 --> 01:09:29.064
Chubby.

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.067
OK, man.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:31.901
Just calm down.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:32.769
You can fight this.

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:33.703
Hit him, you fool.

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:34.537
You hit him.

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:39.175
[thud]

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:40.042
Come on, Wendel.

01:09:40.143 --> 01:09:42.279
It's me-- Eddie.

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:43.947
Look, man, there's
a Chubby in you.

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:47.350
Just try to shit it out, maybe?

01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:48.652
I don't want to
have to hurt you,

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:52.721
buddy, but if I have
to use force-- [thud]

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:54.291
Aw.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:10:01.531
Wendel, please.

01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:04.934
Get off of him!

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.536
[squish]

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:24.220
[growling]

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:31.828
[screaming]

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:34.698
[splashing]

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:15.772
Make it stop.

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:31.287
[sobbing]

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:16.933
Are you OK?

01:12:22.406 --> 01:12:23.673
[gagging]

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:27.411
No.

01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:29.012
I'm covered in ass shit.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:38.622
[squirming]

01:12:59.809 --> 01:13:00.544
Come on.

01:13:00.644 --> 01:13:02.712
We have to get that little fuck.

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:03.379
Grab the guns.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.481
The grenade is mine.

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:12.221
[screaming]

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:13.156
Wait.

01:13:13.256 --> 01:13:14.223
Do you hear that?

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:15.425
-Yeah.
-Could be Sam.

01:13:15.525 --> 01:13:16.292
She's in trouble.

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:18.227
Let's go.

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:19.328
Wow!

01:13:19.429 --> 01:13:20.897
Oh, this is great.

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:22.466
Oh yeah, spaceman.

01:13:22.566 --> 01:13:23.900
So this is sex?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.034
Yes, this is sex.

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:26.603
I love sex.

01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:27.270
Me too.

01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:28.472
Wow!

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:31.307
Wow, this is great.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.876
Hey.

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:33.710
Did you see it?

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:34.911
What?

01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:35.979
A Chubby?

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:36.813
No.

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:37.747
Crocodile Dundee.

01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:39.082
Yes, a Chubby.

01:13:39.182 --> 01:13:41.184
What's that smell?

01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:42.686
It's shit.

01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:44.788
We just had to shove a broom
up our best friend's ass,

01:13:44.888 --> 01:13:47.891
and now, I'm covered in
blood, shit, and Chubby cum.

01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:48.925
Wendel's dead?

01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:50.994
Yeah, he's fucking dead.

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:52.729
And we could have avoided
it too if you weren't

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:54.330
over here fucking the spaceman.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.799
Tom.

01:13:55.899 --> 01:13:57.100
Don't Tom me.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.668
I'm over this bullshit.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:00.369
I've been nothing but a good
guy to you for the past year.

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:03.306
And this guy, this space dick's
been here less than two hours,

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:05.074
and he's already inside you?

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:07.343
I'm sorry.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:08.745
I'm done.

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:10.446
I'm going to go out there
and wait until morning.

01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:12.181
Have fun on your
alien adventure.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.950
Tom, wait.

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:14.784
No.

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:15.619
Let him go.

01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:17.621
You need to stick with us.

01:14:17.721 --> 01:14:20.857
The Chubbies want
you to procreate.

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:23.459
Having them trapped
inside here is our best

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.829
chance of destroying them.

01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:27.997
What time does your boss come?

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:31.100
Uh, couple hours, I guess.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.638
Then we have some time to
find them and destroy them.

01:14:34.738 --> 01:14:37.373
If the Chubbies
get loose outside,

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.443
your city, your
state, your world

01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:43.379
will be taken over by
these sex-fueled creatures

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:48.785
who will stop at nothing to hump
their way to global domination.

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:53.823
For the time being, Samantha,
it's your butt hole they want.

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:59.228
Our primary objective is to
protect your anus at all costs.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:04.233
Aw, that's the sweetest thing
a boy has ever said to me.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.702
I'm no boy.

01:15:05.802 --> 01:15:08.672
I'm Cass Coridore, space lawyer.

01:15:38.602 --> 01:15:42.105
[chubby snickering]

01:16:00.356 --> 01:16:01.090
Ow.

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:02.491
What the fuck?

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:03.492
Ow!

01:16:03.593 --> 01:16:05.061
Sam, get back.

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:05.995
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:07.563
-Get the fuck off me.
-Shoot it.

01:16:07.664 --> 01:16:08.531
Shoot it.

01:16:08.632 --> 01:16:10.066
I can't get a clear shot.

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:30.954
[growling]

01:16:51.574 --> 01:16:52.642
Mr. Moody.

01:16:52.742 --> 01:16:55.011
I'm so glad to see you.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:57.814
Listen, I'm sorry.

01:16:57.914 --> 01:16:59.749
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.

01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:02.752
I only threw the Halloween
party because I didn't think

01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:04.553
you were going to find out.

01:17:04.654 --> 01:17:06.489
The place is trashed.

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:08.858
Most of my friends are dead.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:13.329
And it's all my fault. I didn't
mean for any of this to happen,

01:17:13.429 --> 01:17:15.464
and I regret it all.

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:16.599
I'm so sorry.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:17.834
And I betrayed your trust.

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:21.004
That's the worst part.

01:17:21.104 --> 01:17:23.807
Punish me however you see
fit, but we need to leave now.

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:30.213
Mr. Moody, are you OK?

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:31.047
Faggot!

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:35.184
[gurgling]

01:17:40.623 --> 01:17:43.126
Tom!

01:17:43.226 --> 01:17:43.960
Oh.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.230
Ew.

01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:53.236
Whoa.

01:18:14.457 --> 01:18:17.126
Onto me, my children.

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:25.969
My daddy.

01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:30.106
My daddy.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:30.940
[crunch]

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.341
Oh!

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:35.311
Oh.

01:18:35.411 --> 01:18:38.281
[gurgling]

01:18:39.783 --> 01:18:41.184
That's not good.

01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:46.756
[growl]

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:50.126
[laugh]

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:52.728
[pew pew pew]

01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:55.298
Fools!

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:59.635
Your Snerdian space
lasers won't work on me.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:02.238
Oh, fuck.

01:19:02.338 --> 01:19:04.373
[laugh]

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:05.909
Fuck indeed.

01:19:06.009 --> 01:19:11.881
You're all going to get
fucked, starting with you.

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:17.753
And after I fuck you,
we'll fuck your whole town.

01:19:17.854 --> 01:19:20.924
We'll be the new Adam
and Eve, and we'll just

01:19:21.024 --> 01:19:23.927
keep fucking until we
spread the Chubbies'

01:19:24.027 --> 01:19:27.330
seed through the entire planet.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:33.669
I already told them your plan,
and that's not going to happen.

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.639
You won't be telling
anyone anything when you

01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:39.275
have this chubby in your mouth.

01:19:45.414 --> 01:19:47.616
Stop it, Moody.

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:50.086
Look, I know you
never really liked me.

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:53.722
You always called me
a gay wad and stuff.

01:19:53.823 --> 01:19:57.193
But there's gotta be
some good left in you.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:01.597
You can be a hero by killing
yourself and the Chubbies.

01:20:01.697 --> 01:20:07.270
You can save us and the planet.

01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:08.271
Please, Moody.

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.577
[whispering]

01:20:14.677 --> 01:20:16.112
What?

01:20:16.212 --> 01:20:19.015
Fire!

01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:20.950
[scream]

01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:28.791
Samantha, you have to run.

01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:29.758
Get out of here.

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:30.894
Moody's right by the door.

01:20:30.994 --> 01:20:32.528
There's no way
he'll let me pass.

01:20:32.628 --> 01:20:34.397
I'll create a diversion.

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:37.266
Come on.

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:39.235
Come on, Chubbies.

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:41.871
Fuck me.

01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:45.808
Go ahead, stick it right
here in my butt cave.

01:20:45.909 --> 01:20:47.810
Come on, you big,
fat pussylicker.

01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:48.878
Fuck.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.085
[glass shattering]

01:20:57.586 --> 01:21:00.456
Where were we?

01:21:00.556 --> 01:21:01.857
Oh, yes.

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:03.026
The fucking.

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:12.668
Sam, get out of here.

01:21:12.768 --> 01:21:14.537
Hail to the kingpin, baby.

01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:15.838
[squish]

01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:19.242
[screaming]

01:21:19.342 --> 01:21:22.011

01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:24.213
[glass shattering]

01:21:43.766 --> 01:21:44.533
GENERAL (ON RADIO): Cass.

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:45.534
Come in, Cass.

01:21:54.677 --> 01:21:56.745
I'm here.

01:21:56.845 --> 01:22:00.916
The Chubbies, are
they destroyed?

01:22:01.017 --> 01:22:04.820
Yes, they've been blown up.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.722
Phew.

01:22:06.822 --> 01:22:10.193
Oh, that is
exquisite news, Cass.

01:22:10.293 --> 01:22:12.061
Very good.

01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:14.964
When you get back to Snerd,
I will make sure Rape Bot

01:22:15.064 --> 01:22:17.333
erects a statue in your honor.

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:23.839
My erection is only
made for raping.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:28.777
When will Rape Bot
find time for a statue?

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.513
Hey, that's OK.

01:22:30.613 --> 01:22:32.948
Because everybody on this
planet looks like him.

01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:35.451
We'll just say it's for him.

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:36.852
Yeah.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:39.655
Oh, so that's it?

01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:40.723
My friends are dead.

01:22:40.823 --> 01:22:42.191
I don't have a job.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:46.329
And you're going to leave,
just like everybody else?

01:22:46.429 --> 01:22:48.331
Cass, give me your coordinates.

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:51.334
We'll send a spaceship
to pick you up right now.

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:55.638
General.

01:22:55.738 --> 01:22:57.206
Enis.

01:22:57.306 --> 01:23:00.509
You can go ahead and
shove that shuttle

01:23:00.609 --> 01:23:04.113
up your fat fucking asses.

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:05.781
I'm staying on Earth.

01:23:05.881 --> 01:23:07.550
What in the Snerd?

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:11.220
Cass, you can't be serious.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.656
You'll be a hero here.

01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:15.024
I don't care.

01:23:15.124 --> 01:23:18.594
I found something
more important to me.

01:23:18.694 --> 01:23:19.928
Tits.

01:23:20.029 --> 01:23:22.798
I found out that I love
big, fat fucking tits.

01:23:22.898 --> 01:23:25.668
And my dick, it works on Earth.

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:29.238
And I have someone to use it on.

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:31.840
Screw you, Snerdians.

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:32.708
Coridore!

01:23:35.278 --> 01:23:36.712
[glass shattering]

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.014
[police sirens]

01:23:39.115 --> 01:23:40.883
Let's get the
Earth out of here.

01:23:40.983 --> 01:23:41.717
Let's go.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:49.692
So I guess I should've asked you
earlier, but how old are you?

01:23:49.792 --> 01:23:51.960
1.28 Snerd sacks.

01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:53.496
Why?

01:23:53.596 --> 01:23:57.500
Um, well, if anyone asks,
just say you're in high school,

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.501
like me.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:02.105
OK.

01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:21.824
[laughing]

01:24:21.924 --> 01:24:26.629
