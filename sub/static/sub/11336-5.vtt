00:17.351 --> 00:18.150
Sierra One,

00:18.151 --> 00:18.950
wait on my Scorpio.

00:18.951 --> 00:19.750
SAM:
Sierra One, copy.

00:26.027 --> 00:29.762
MAN:
Get those hands up.
(woman gasps)

00:29.764 --> 00:32.097
Your hands up.
Keep your hands up!

00:33.200 --> 00:34.433
Hang on. Here he comes.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.204
I got the solution.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.406
MAN:
Get down!
WOMAN:
No!

00:40.408 --> 00:41.774
Get down!

00:41.776 --> 00:43.242
Don't!

00:43.244 --> 00:44.476
(gun chamber clicks)
Don't do it!

00:44.478 --> 00:45.444
Stop!

00:47.148 --> 00:48.414
(whimpering)

00:52.787 --> 00:53.786
JULES:
No! Please!

00:53.788 --> 00:54.820
MAN:
Please don't kill us!

00:54.822 --> 00:56.355
No!
Why not?

00:56.357 --> 00:57.656
What have I got to lose?

00:57.658 --> 00:59.391
You sound very upset.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.759
You're damn straight I am.

01:00.761 --> 01:03.062
Look, I hear what
you're saying, okay?

01:03.064 --> 01:05.264
Stay in control.
This is your negotiation.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.234
What do we need to do
so that we can all go home?

01:09.236 --> 01:10.269
You can give me what I want.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.503
I'd like to try.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.072
You know what
I'd really like?

01:13.074 --> 01:14.339
I'd like some coke.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.542
How about that, huh?

01:16.544 --> 01:18.077
You give me an ounce,
this is over.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.646
Hello!

01:20.648 --> 01:21.847
ED:
I'm gonna do it.
Hello!

01:21.849 --> 01:23.215
A little help here.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.383
Hello!
Hello!

01:24.385 --> 01:25.384
Hello!

01:25.386 --> 01:26.585
You hear me, but
you're not doing

01:26.587 --> 01:28.520
nothing about it.
He's a lying pig.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.556
I'm not a liar.
PARKER:
Don't argue.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.424
Just get him back.
Okay, look,

01:32.426 --> 01:33.759
you're obviously very upset.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.594
Yes. Yes. You know
what that means?

01:35.596 --> 01:37.229
JULES:
You know I really
wish a cop

01:37.231 --> 01:38.397
would negotiate us to safety.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.865
Come on, Sam,
just talk to them.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.102
Dude, you know what I want!

01:43.103 --> 01:44.369
I'm not giving you cocaine,
jackass.

01:44.371 --> 01:45.604
Bang. Bang.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.372
Jackass?

01:47.374 --> 01:49.374
Did he say
jackass?

01:49.376 --> 01:51.376
Okay, Sam, let's
talk this through.

01:51.378 --> 01:54.246
Just give me a minute, Sarge.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.754
Can't you just give me
some more time, okay?

02:02.756 --> 02:04.790
What about a...?
Just give me a week.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.558
Okay, a couple of days then.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.393
Just a couple...

02:08.395 --> 02:10.395
(distant siren blaring)

02:10.397 --> 02:12.464
No, fine.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.468
Maybe I'll get it tonight.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.505
(phone chirps off)

02:44.632 --> 02:46.698
Long way
from Kandahar, huh?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.668
I was doing everything right,
wasn't I?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.470
Mirroring, emotional labeling,
eye messaging,

02:51.472 --> 02:53.572
everything in the book,
but I just....

02:53.574 --> 02:56.242
Need to listen.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.911
Look, you can kick ass
like nobody's business,

02:58.913 --> 03:00.879
and you look great
in the cool pants,

03:00.881 --> 03:02.681
but as long as
you're out there,

03:02.683 --> 03:04.616
and you're trying
to talk to somebody,

03:04.618 --> 03:06.351
you've got to be
able to listen,

03:06.353 --> 03:07.920
you've got to be
able to connect.

03:07.922 --> 03:09.555
I know, okay. It's just...

03:09.557 --> 03:11.607
How do I connect

03:11.608 --> 03:13.658
to bad guys when I spent
four years shooting 'em?

03:15.462 --> 03:18.197
I just need
to finish this review.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.232
No, you need time.

03:20.234 --> 03:23.535
Field training, a
little patience, okay?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.537
Remember,

03:25.539 --> 03:27.639
you got the cool pants down.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.480
12 months ago,

03:35.482 --> 03:38.483
this bank was City Central's
lowest-performing branch

03:38.485 --> 03:40.652
in the downtown quarter.

03:40.654 --> 03:44.523
Since then,
thanks to all of you,

03:44.525 --> 03:46.625
we're at number two.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.528
Now, before we start
the new week,

03:49.530 --> 03:51.496
I'd like to highlight
the current figures...

03:51.498 --> 03:52.931
(door opens)
...from our sales team.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.000
Top seller,
third week running...

03:55.002 --> 03:56.435
I'm sorry,
Miss Geller...

03:59.540 --> 04:01.657
Please, join
your group.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.775
Top sales figure for RSPs
and mutual funds...

04:03.777 --> 04:05.544
goes to Wendy Trailor.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.613
Great work, Wendy.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.784
Let's have an excellent week,
everyone. Thank you.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.486
WOMAN:
Thank you.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.388
(employees murmuring)

04:16.390 --> 04:18.724
Paul? Paul, a word?

04:20.527 --> 04:22.527
Miss Geller,
I'm really sorry.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.862
My wife has just d...

04:23.864 --> 04:25.864
Paul, please.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.633
You don't have to apologize

04:27.635 --> 04:30.035
for what's happening in
your personal life ever.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.536
Thank you.

04:31.538 --> 04:32.871
It's been a hard week.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.339
But...

04:34.341 --> 04:36.341
you can't expect your team

04:36.343 --> 04:38.343
to pull your weight, either.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.413
It's a question
of priorities.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.548
Figure out yours, please.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.617
Yes, absolutely.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.453
That's all.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.888
Oh, and could
someone ask security

04:49.890 --> 04:51.590
to call the alarm company?

04:51.592 --> 04:54.059
There was an error code
with the door this morning.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.470
MAN:
Do you know who I am?

05:05.472 --> 05:07.572
I said, do you know
who I am?

05:07.574 --> 05:08.807
Yes.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.443
Good.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.811
Then you know what to do.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.747
I want $500,000.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.684
You're going to bring it
back up here, let me check it,

05:18.686 --> 05:20.385
and then I go.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.738
Okay.
What did I say?

05:22.739 --> 05:25.090
$500,000, I bring it back;
you check it, and then you go.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.525
No dye packs.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.243
No dye packs.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.960
You check it. You go.
No one gets hurt.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.763
No one gets hurt.
That's right.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.465
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.501
Let's go.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.672
Go on.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.794
WOMAN:
Miss Geller,
is it okay if I grab

06:02.796 --> 06:04.763
the Foreign Exchange file
from your desk?

06:04.765 --> 06:06.698
Uh, no.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.700
No. Okay,

06:08.702 --> 06:10.001
well, I can ask
somebody else

06:10.003 --> 06:11.570
if you don't want me
in there.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.637
Do not go upstairs.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.373
Danger.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.777
(whispers):
Robbery.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.479
Manager's office.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.813
Robbery!

06:21.815 --> 06:25.550
(alarms wailing,
people screaming)

06:28.956 --> 06:31.022
Nobody move!
Nobody move!

06:31.024 --> 06:33.592
Hey! Hold it!

06:33.594 --> 06:34.793
You idiot!
(gasps)

06:34.795 --> 06:36.495
What did you do? Hey!

06:36.497 --> 06:38.130
(people screaming)

06:38.132 --> 06:39.831
You're the big boss.
You're the big manager.

06:39.833 --> 06:40.799
Tell them to calm down.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.000
MAN:
Just calm down.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.970
GELLER:
Everybody, calm
down. Calm down.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.905
Tell 'em again!
Calm down.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.674
Or somebody's
gonna get hurt, you got it?

06:49.676 --> 06:55.080
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

07:23.010 --> 07:25.177
WOMAN (over dispatch):
Team One, gear up.

07:25.179 --> 07:28.647
Loud call. Armed robbery
in progress, Young and Queen.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.483
Possible hostages,
single suspect, armed.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.218
(sirens chirping)

07:33.220 --> 07:35.220
(tires squealing)

07:37.124 --> 07:38.623
(sirens blaring)

07:38.625 --> 07:39.791
(tires squealing)

07:39.793 --> 07:41.560
(sirens chirping and beeping)

07:51.505 --> 07:53.638
You got anything else?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.674
Okay. Thank you.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.875
You got a video of him yet?

07:56.877 --> 07:58.477
No. Alarm company says

07:58.479 --> 08:01.146
someone comes in
early morning with
an override code.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.014
I'm gonna assume
it's our guy.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.182
Video and audio
are all cut.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.251
So nobody could ID him
when he got away.

08:06.253 --> 08:09.254
Still, would have been kind of
hard, what with the ski mask.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.656
Great.
Not great?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.057
MO matches the
Monday Morning Bandit.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.575
You heard of him?

08:13.576 --> 08:15.092
Like, five jobs this year
already. That guy?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.796
Six. We got ourselves
a big fish. Guy's a pro.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.198
He knows managers
are trained not to
pull the alarm,

08:20.200 --> 08:21.967
but just hand
over the cash.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.535
Somebody didn't get that memo.

08:23.537 --> 08:26.171
Last one, a couple
of tellers gave him some lip,

08:26.173 --> 08:28.106
and he shot them both
without blinking.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.841
JULES:
What about back ways,
loading doors?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.142
Any entrance
besides the main door?

08:31.144 --> 08:32.811
No, it's just
the front doors.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.546
The fire exit's
around the other side,

08:34.548 --> 08:36.548
but it's... it's all
out in the open.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.751
So, there's no way we can get
in there without him seeing us?

08:39.753 --> 08:41.052
Okay. Okay,
you figure out

08:41.054 --> 08:42.854
how to get into
the impossible building,

08:42.856 --> 08:45.657
and I'll go talk to the killer
with nothing to lose.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.125
If you put
it that way.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.161
Sam, you're with Ed.
Jules, you're my second.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.297
Let me be second, Sarge.
JULES:
Easy, cowboy.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.666
You know you can't blow or shoot
anything up in the truck, right?

08:54.668 --> 08:56.134
I could use
the field training.

08:56.136 --> 08:59.237
So long as you're not scared
of blowing anything up.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.872
No.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.941
All right, follow me.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.052
(phone ringing)

09:18.191 --> 09:19.724
(phone chirps on)

09:19.726 --> 09:21.560
Yeah?

09:21.562 --> 09:23.194
Hello. This is
Sergeant Gregory Parker

09:23.196 --> 09:25.030
with the Police Strategic
Response Unit.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.232
Am I talking
with the person in charge?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.834
This is the guy
you're gonna get a half million

09:29.836 --> 09:32.337
in unmarked 50s for,
and by noon.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.306
First contact
with subject made 9:27 a.m.

09:34.308 --> 09:35.740
PARKER:
Well, I hear you,

09:35.742 --> 09:37.676
but you're the one
in the bank, sir.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.011
Look, I don't know who you think
you're dealing with.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.212
I'm not some junkie

09:41.214 --> 09:42.847
that's looking
for his day's fix, okay?

09:42.849 --> 09:45.250
You and I both know
that once that alarm went off,

09:45.252 --> 09:48.286
that vault went into hard lock,
and the only way

09:48.288 --> 09:51.256
you get it open now is
manual override, you know that,

09:51.258 --> 09:54.960
so... you are gonna get me
my money.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.628
You're gonna get me my money.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.830
You're gonna get me a car.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.832
An open car,
which you will park

10:00.834 --> 10:03.301
at the northeast corner
of Young and Queen,

10:03.303 --> 10:06.237
and then sit back as me
and my hostage drive right off.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.772
Is all that clear?

10:07.774 --> 10:09.774
You're gonna do this by noon,

10:09.776 --> 10:11.943
and if you don't,
here's what's gonna happen.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.012
Here, tell him.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.782
(gun chamber clicking)

10:17.784 --> 10:18.950
(gasps)

10:18.952 --> 10:21.653
This is Ruth Geller.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.222
I'm the manager of the bank.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.992
(voice breaking):
Please do exactly
as this man says,

10:26.994 --> 10:28.827
or he'll kill us all.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.629
That's very good. Nice job.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.697
(phone beeps off)

10:35.369 --> 10:37.402
Have we got
an action plan yet?

10:37.404 --> 10:39.304
What about
the getaway car he wants?

10:39.306 --> 10:41.272
Couldn't we just fit it
with a tracker?

10:41.274 --> 10:43.108
Yeah, we could, but he wants it

10:43.110 --> 10:44.309
at one of the busiest
intersections

10:44.311 --> 10:45.944
in this city at lunch hour.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.046
My bet, he takes a hostage
as a shield,

10:48.048 --> 10:49.681
gets within ten feet
of that car,

10:49.683 --> 10:50.849
shoots the hostage, runs.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.350
When there's a crowd
in the subway,

10:52.352 --> 10:54.052
he'll lose us in two minutes.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.253
This guy is smart.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.155
We got to get to him
before that.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.257
Subway.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.092
You ever hear of Joe Sampson?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.327
Underground crew
Joe Sampson?

11:02.329 --> 11:03.828
He always used to say,

11:03.830 --> 11:06.698
the best banks to hit
were the ones by the subways.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.067
Underground access,
breakable walls.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.136
Nobody sees a thing.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.739
How the hell
do you know Joe Sampson?

11:14.741 --> 11:17.208
It takes a village.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.849
Yeah, we've got just
over two hours.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.851
What do we do when
he demands his money?

11:26.853 --> 11:28.853
Refer to a high authority,
get concessions,

11:28.855 --> 11:30.321
try to keep him
on the line.
Good.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.857
So, how do we make
a connection
with this guy?

11:32.859 --> 11:35.126
Can talk anybody
out of anything

11:35.128 --> 11:36.461
if he thinks you
don't understand.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.862
So what do you understand?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.330
I don't know.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.732
Guy's a thief.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.200
You take pride in your job;
so does he.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.334
Connection.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.586
Right?

11:44.587 --> 11:45.837
But remember what
the point is, Sam.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.839
It's not you.
It's not him.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.874
It's those
hostages.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.042
It's Ruth Skellar.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.111
She's the point.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.916
(phone ringing)

12:00.854 --> 12:01.920
Okay, you got my money?

12:01.922 --> 12:03.221
Okay.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.057
Now, passed on your requests
to my superiors,

12:06.059 --> 12:07.292
but one thing
that'll help us

12:07.294 --> 12:08.927
is a sign of good faith
on your part.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.429
Yeah, this is where I'm supposed

12:10.430 --> 12:11.930
to start turning over
my hostages, I guess.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.131
That's not going
to happen.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.399
It's nice dealing

12:14.401 --> 12:16.234
with a professional.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.936
Six banks, six getaways.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.237
That's something.
That's planning.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.839
Is that why you've always
worked alone?

12:20.841 --> 12:21.940
That's easier to plan.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.775
Easier to plan,
that's right, yeah.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.076
And you're alone now, too,
right?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.211
Part of the plan.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.849
It's like I tell
my guys,

12:30.851 --> 12:32.884
you fail the plan,
you plan to fail, am I right?

12:32.886 --> 12:34.953
Something like that.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.021
And I respect that, but how long
can you keep doing this?

12:37.023 --> 12:39.190
I'm just saying
you know

12:39.192 --> 12:41.860
how this usually
ends, right?

12:41.862 --> 12:43.795
Don't we all want to go home?

12:43.797 --> 12:45.096
How the hell am I supposed
to do that?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.264
What does that even mean?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.832
How am I supposed to do that?

12:47.834 --> 12:49.467
Is it the last job
you're worried about?

12:49.469 --> 12:51.870
Shooting the tellers,
what was it 14, 15 times?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.838
That says to me
that something went very wrong.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.441
Something that you didn't want
to do, right?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.809
Yeah, that's right.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.043
That's nothing I wanted.

12:59.045 --> 13:02.046
Yeah, doesn't sound
like you.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.048
But it is me.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.517
All right.

13:05.519 --> 13:08.019
That's me and I don't get
what I want.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.555
And I advise you
to remember that.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.824
Just remember it.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.829
Catch the remorse
about the shooting?

13:17.831 --> 13:19.197
Yeah.
Yep.

13:19.199 --> 13:22.233
Not the typical
antisocial profile.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.271
Check this with
the holdup squad.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.442
Hey, Eddie, how are we doing
with our delivered action plan?

13:31.444 --> 13:34.579
Heading underground
now, boss.

13:46.893 --> 13:48.960
Excuse me.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.033
What do you want?

13:57.003 --> 13:59.003
People need to go
to the bathroom.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.874
So?

14:02.876 --> 14:04.876
So...

14:04.878 --> 14:06.277
so I assume you
don't want

14:06.279 --> 14:08.613
these people dirtying
themselves on the floor.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.914
Oh.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.549
And why would I care?

14:11.551 --> 14:13.551
Because it's just going
to make them more afraid,

14:13.553 --> 14:15.553
and on edge.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.055
I'm just trying
to make this easier

14:17.057 --> 14:18.389
for everybody...
You want to make
things easier,

14:18.391 --> 14:19.624
sit down and shut up.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.893
Sit down.

14:24.130 --> 14:27.298
ED:
We're in the tunnel
under the subway.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.367
Jules, distraction
on my go.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.072
Jules, where are we?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.473
Good to go.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.507
Team?

14:36.509 --> 14:38.943
Checking wall thickness.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.480
(beeping)

14:42.482 --> 14:44.482
(phone ringing)

14:44.484 --> 14:46.484
Okay, I told you noon.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.319
We're still working
on everything.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.321
I just wanted to warn you
about something.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.323
The manual alarm,
when it was tripped,

14:52.325 --> 14:54.525
it automatically reset,
so in about a minute

14:54.527 --> 14:56.060
it's going to go off again

14:56.062 --> 14:58.363
and I just need you to stay calm
when that happens.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.465
Okay? That's all
I wanted to say.

15:04.471 --> 15:07.005
Get back.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.479
Ready, Jules?

15:14.481 --> 15:16.014
Ready when you are.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.115
Five,

15:17.117 --> 15:21.085
four, three, two...

15:21.087 --> 15:23.955
(alarm blaring)

15:23.957 --> 15:26.324
Calm down!

15:28.295 --> 15:30.295
We're in.

15:30.297 --> 15:33.464
Basement's ours.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.533
Thanks. Will do.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.305
Nice catch.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.307
Littler fish.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.975
Team, listen up.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.677
Subject is not who we thought.

15:45.679 --> 15:48.179
Monday Morning Bandits' murders
were execution-style,

15:48.181 --> 15:49.597
two bullets.

15:49.598 --> 15:51.014
But the story the press got
was a bloodbath--

15:51.017 --> 15:52.984
multiple shots fired.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.320
The subject does not contradict
the press version.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.487
That's all he knew.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.190
So, we have no idea
who this guy is.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.259
We're moving up.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.463
Excuse me...

16:05.465 --> 16:07.065
What?!
This woman

16:07.067 --> 16:08.733
has asthma.
She needs her medication.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.034
So what?
I'm doing

16:10.036 --> 16:11.703
my part to keep
these people calm.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.071
Can't you do yours?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.405
Want to tell me
how to do my job?

16:14.407 --> 16:15.506
Is that what you want
to do?

16:15.508 --> 16:16.975
No, I...
Yeah, go ahead.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.109
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.
Tell me.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.978
You sit down!

16:19.980 --> 16:21.612
Sit down, sit down now!
Sit down you!

16:21.614 --> 16:22.647
(gunshot)

16:22.649 --> 16:24.582
(screaming)

16:24.584 --> 16:26.651
Boss, subject's gone active.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.453
We're moving in.
We're east...

16:28.455 --> 16:30.355
Police! Police!

16:34.027 --> 16:35.059
MAN 2:
Everybody out!
Move to the front!

16:35.061 --> 16:36.094
Police!
Get these people

16:36.096 --> 16:38.029
out of here.
Move! Move!

16:38.031 --> 16:39.063
Out of the way.

16:39.065 --> 16:40.098
Right there.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.366
Right there.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.533
Set the gun down.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.634
Set the gun down.

16:43.636 --> 16:44.602
Put your gun down!

16:44.604 --> 16:46.037
Set the gun down.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.772
We're not going
anywhere.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.040
I'm telling you,
get out of the bank!

16:49.042 --> 16:51.275
Sir, put the gun down now!

16:51.277 --> 16:52.276
Get out or I kill her!

16:52.278 --> 16:53.311
I tell you I will.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.079
We're not leaving.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.147
Well, then she dies.
Three...

16:57.384 --> 16:59.050
Please.
...and in two...

17:00.420 --> 17:02.086
...and in one...

17:02.088 --> 17:04.455
Team One, we're coming out.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.225
Subject still has a hostage.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.160
Go!

17:15.068 --> 17:17.135
Lock the door.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.571
Hurry up!

17:20.573 --> 17:22.640
Come on, come on.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.518
Hey, hey!

17:33.520 --> 17:35.653
(groans)

17:39.492 --> 17:41.492
(gasping)

17:41.494 --> 17:43.528
Oh, God!

17:43.530 --> 17:46.597
(gasping):
George!

17:52.105 --> 17:54.205
Spike was able
to reconnect the video,

17:54.207 --> 17:56.274
but there's no audio.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.412
Here we go.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.482
And freeze it there.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.517
Get the security guy.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.686
Can we get the security
guard in here, please?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.755
Look at them. They're just...
She's just looking at him

18:10.757 --> 18:12.590
like they know
each other.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.725
Yeah.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.727
Hey, buddy.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.729
This guy ring
any bells?

18:18.731 --> 18:20.598
That's George.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.217
Who's George?
George Orston.

18:22.218 --> 18:23.835
Head of security here
at the bank. He was my boss.

18:23.837 --> 18:25.103
Was until when?

18:25.105 --> 18:26.437
Uh, till about two months ago.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.672
When she fired him.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.521
10:58, subject's
employee record,

18:43.523 --> 18:45.456
delivered by constable
Lewis Young.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.758
Been at the bank
since '81.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.760
Head of security
for the past ten years.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.596
He's no career criminal.

18:51.598 --> 18:52.763
We need a new strategy.

18:52.765 --> 18:53.898
Initiate Stockholm?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.600
Hey, doc,
thanks for coming.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.668
We've got a disgruntled
employee. Any thoughts?

18:57.670 --> 19:00.671
I had four of those cases
in the last month.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.674
Okay, you need to look
for inadequate personalities,

19:03.676 --> 19:05.209
substance abuse.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.644
Appeal to shared
experience,

19:06.646 --> 19:08.613
validate his emotional
reality.
I hear you.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.648
Losing your job,
I'd be pissed, too.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.184
Let him know we've ID'd him,
we lose tactical advantage.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.819
Yeah, but I gain intimacy.
I gain a name.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.288
Yeah, but it's going to be hard
to calm him down

19:17.290 --> 19:18.756
when he knows
there's a camera on him.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.191
Going to need a cover story.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.859
Right, noted.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.368
Hey, guys. What do we
have on his hostage?

19:30.370 --> 19:31.769
Miss Trailor, you want to tell
Sergeant Parker here

19:31.771 --> 19:33.504
what you just told us.

19:33.506 --> 19:37.642
Look, what George is doing--
I'm not saying it's right--

19:37.644 --> 19:40.645
but Ruth Skellar came in
around a year ago.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.263
Corporate clean-up.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.880
We were in trouble,
and she turned us around.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.551
But a lot of people
lost their jobs.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.286
And those of us that stayed,

19:48.288 --> 19:49.587
half of us are losing
our families.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.389
My wife had a baby
a week ago.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.690
I barely see
either of them,

19:52.692 --> 19:54.559
but it's not like
Skellar cares.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.627
Woman's a robot.
I'm just saying

19:56.629 --> 19:58.696
if I was her,
I wouldn't want to be alone

19:58.698 --> 20:00.965
with a former employee
who was armed.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.574
Please, George.
Shut up!

20:09.576 --> 20:12.343
I don't want to hear
one word out of you,
you understand?

20:12.345 --> 20:14.412
Not a peep.

20:19.219 --> 20:22.220
Subject's still got a clear view
of the bank from that hallway.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.222
I don't see us pulling
the entry trick again.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.557
I still think you should try
initiating Stockholm.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.659
According to the manual,

20:28.660 --> 20:30.760
a subject with a hostage is
an object of anger or scorn.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.430
His negotiator
should attempt to...

20:32.432 --> 20:34.432
Humanize the hostage
to the hostage taker.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.733
I know
the manual, okay?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.602
Once this guy knows
he lost his cover,

20:37.604 --> 20:39.604
he'll be thinking
his life is over.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.672
And he's holed up with the woman
that made it happen.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.507
So my goal is getting
him to think

20:43.509 --> 20:44.775
about anything but her, okay?

20:44.777 --> 20:46.744
I just...
Boss, boss,

20:46.746 --> 20:47.979
when you talk this guy out,

20:47.981 --> 20:49.714
you're going to have
the white covered already.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.782
I want to put snipers
on red just in case.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.017
We need a side solution.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.353
Why don't Braddock
and I take Sierra One and Two?

20:56.322 --> 20:58.689
Okay, do it.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.629
(cell phone ringing)

21:04.631 --> 21:05.863
Yeah?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.398
Is this George Orston?

21:09.736 --> 21:11.636
I'll take that as a yes.

21:11.638 --> 21:15.573
A colleague identified
your voice, George, so...

21:15.575 --> 21:17.675
can we talk straight?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.711
First of all, this
is a big relief.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.980
We thought you were
a pretty bad guy.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.416
But now that I've seen
your file,

21:25.418 --> 21:27.852
I think you're a guy who got

21:27.853 --> 21:30.287
kicked to the curb and now
wants a little payback.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.023
I don't think you want
to hurt anybody.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.557
Don't tell me what I want.

21:33.559 --> 21:34.959
You know exactly what I want.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.828
It's exactly the same as before.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.664
And now, I know
I can't trust you.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.599
I want you to trust me, George.

21:41.601 --> 21:42.633
Yeah, well, then,
you shouldn't

21:42.635 --> 21:43.701
have sent in
the cavalry, then,

21:43.703 --> 21:45.770
should you have?

21:45.772 --> 21:47.772
You know what?

21:47.774 --> 21:51.042
I was going to give you just
less than an hour from here,

21:51.044 --> 21:52.743
but now, after what you've done,

21:52.745 --> 21:54.679
that's going
to be a half an hour.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.882
You don't give me what I want
in one-half hour,

21:57.884 --> 21:59.016
I'm going to shoot her

21:59.018 --> 22:00.551
right here.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.019
Get his focus
off her, onto you.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.788
George, listen to me,
I'll do everything I can,

22:03.790 --> 22:05.690
but a half hour
is not a lot of time

22:05.692 --> 22:07.024
to get you that kind of cash.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.759
Cash? What am I going
to do with cash?

22:08.761 --> 22:10.661
Oh, this is...
this is what you're going to do.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.096
Okay, you're going to...
you're going

22:12.098 --> 22:13.931
to transfer that money
right in this bank.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.767
I got an account
number for you.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.436
Mark it down.
I won't say it again.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.837
0-6...

22:19.839 --> 22:21.572
Uh, what is it?

22:21.574 --> 22:24.809
9-8-1-0-9.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.844
Okay?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.913
And then, I'll get
the boss lady here to take me

22:28.915 --> 22:31.382
over to a computer,
and she's going to verify for me

22:31.384 --> 22:33.784
whether that money is received
within the next half hour.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.753
And if it isn't,

22:35.755 --> 22:37.822
I'm going to put a
bullet in her head.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.523
Okay, and don't make the mistake

22:39.525 --> 22:41.592
of thinking that won't be easy
for me to do.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.661
It'll be very easy
after what she's done to me.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.529
Hey, boss, arriving
in position.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.298
PARKER:
Copy.

22:47.299 --> 22:49.066
Hey, Spike, I need an
ID on a bank account:

22:49.068 --> 22:52.370
0698109.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.588
Copy.

22:53.589 --> 22:54.805
Okay, Joe,
just forget about her.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.741
Let's talk about you
and why you're here.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.910
Why I'm here is because
of what<i> she's</i> done to me!

22:59.912 --> 23:00.845
That's why we're here.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.681
(whispering):
It wasn't personal.

23:03.683 --> 23:04.782
What'd you say?

23:04.784 --> 23:06.050
Hey, George, just stay with me.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.118
Shut up.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.519
Come on, George.
She can't help you.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.987
I'm the guy
who can give you what you want.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.456
No, I want her... I
want her to tell me.

23:12.458 --> 23:13.991
Pretty please?

23:13.993 --> 23:16.093
I want her
to tell me

23:16.095 --> 23:18.129
how 20 years of a man's life

23:18.131 --> 23:20.598
ended up worth
practically nothing.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.433
You tell me how a man works,

23:22.435 --> 23:25.469
doesn't put a foot wrong
his whole life,

23:25.471 --> 23:27.805
and then at the end,
you hand him a check,

23:27.807 --> 23:30.908
and it's worth
like one week's salary

23:30.910 --> 23:32.643
for every year worked.

23:32.645 --> 23:35.579
What am I suppose to do with all
that money, buy myself a car?

23:35.581 --> 23:36.881
Is that what I'm supposed to do?

23:37.850 --> 23:38.983
Would you mind
explaining to me

23:38.985 --> 23:40.184
how you come with that figure?

23:40.186 --> 23:41.852
How did you come up
with that number?

23:41.854 --> 23:45.189
It's a standard
termination package, George.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.458
It wasn't personal.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.793
Oh, you're missing
all the comedy.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.494
It wasn't personal.
That's what she says.

23:50.496 --> 23:51.629
It wasn't personal?

23:51.631 --> 23:53.214
Come on, George, come on.

23:53.215 --> 23:54.798
You gotta know this is hard
for her, same as you.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.000
I doubt that very much.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.568
Ruth has done
everything right

23:57.570 --> 23:59.970
her whole life,
lived for her job,

23:59.972 --> 24:01.288
just like you.

24:01.289 --> 24:02.605
You loved your job, too,
am I right?

24:02.608 --> 24:04.175
I gotta go.

24:08.748 --> 24:12.016
You know what, this is looking
kind of bad for you...

24:12.018 --> 24:13.951
boss lady.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.155
Are you buddies?
George?

24:18.157 --> 24:19.723
I don't know
if I'd say buddies.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.158
Pretty private guy,
George, but a good boss.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.760
Always made sure
I was doing okay.

24:22.762 --> 24:23.828
He's a regular guy,
good guy.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.162
What about family?
Ever met them?

24:25.164 --> 24:26.230
Other than Mary?

24:26.232 --> 24:27.932
Who's Mary?

24:28.901 --> 24:30.100
His wife.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.036
See, that's why
I don't get this.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.904
The day he got canned,
all he said was,

24:33.906 --> 24:35.940
"Well, now I can spend
more time with Mary."

24:35.942 --> 24:37.475
No kids,
as far as I know.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.109
He just pretty much
lived for her.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.177
Did you ever meet her?

24:40.179 --> 24:42.480
Sure, yeah,
she was always by

24:42.482 --> 24:43.681
for lunches and stuff.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.149
Uh, well, not now, but...

24:45.151 --> 24:46.750
What, since he was fired?

24:46.752 --> 24:48.919
No, I mean the last year
or so, actually,

24:48.921 --> 24:51.088
but before then,
yeah, all the time.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.723
All right, thanks.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.258
Thank<i> you.</i>

24:57.597 --> 24:59.129
How'd you get in
just like that?

24:59.131 --> 25:00.631
Technical genius.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.533
Bank gave me
the pass codes.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.235
Okay, last step,
the password.

25:04.237 --> 25:07.004
"Hotstuff": one
word, no space.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.641
What?

25:10.643 --> 25:12.109
What kind of account
is this?

25:12.111 --> 25:14.545
Looks like a straight
payment account.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.747
You put money in,
the holder withdraws.

25:16.749 --> 25:20.184
This one's for... there.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.087
Saint Ignatius
Homes, Limited.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.788
Whatever that is.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.293
So you planned all this

25:29.295 --> 25:31.161
just from watching
security tapes?

25:31.163 --> 25:32.196
GEORGE:
Yeah, that's right.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.797
All the banks
showed them.

25:33.799 --> 25:35.933
They wanted us all
to see the guy's MO.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.801
You know what I used
to do? Make notes.

25:37.803 --> 25:38.969
That's pretty
good notes.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.604
Thank you.

25:40.605 --> 25:42.238
Hey, George, is there
anybody you want us

25:42.241 --> 25:43.841
to get a message to,
anybody at all?

25:43.843 --> 25:45.242
Look, I know what you're doing,
all right?

25:45.244 --> 25:46.911
We're wasting enough
time right here.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.712
You got, like, less
than 20 minutes left.

25:48.714 --> 25:49.813
Give me my money.

25:49.815 --> 25:51.115
I know, we're still
working on it.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.017
We just need you
to stay calm, okay?

25:53.019 --> 25:54.251
That's easy
for you to stay.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.853
You've got a life
to go back to

25:55.855 --> 25:57.588
at the end of this--
what have I got?

25:57.590 --> 25:59.323
Well, to tell you the truth,
it's not like

25:59.325 --> 26:00.791
you've told me
a lot about yourself.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.694
Well, what's there to tell?

26:03.696 --> 26:05.596
And who cares anyway?

26:05.598 --> 26:07.331
You think this one
sitting beside me

26:07.333 --> 26:08.899
thinks she cares?

26:08.901 --> 26:10.968
The account's for a
retirement home downtown.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.119
I can go right now

26:12.120 --> 26:13.269
and get the answers faster
in person.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.039
Okay, drive fast.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.807
You want someone like her
thinks of someone like me?

26:16.809 --> 26:17.841
Whoa, George, where'd you go?

26:17.843 --> 26:19.577
Don't go back down that road.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.312
Come on, buddy, you were going
to tell me about yourself.

26:21.314 --> 26:23.113
I'm a line item
on a budget,

26:23.115 --> 26:25.966
and that's about it.

26:25.967 --> 26:28.818
I'm George Orston,
$47,000 a year, plus benefits.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.622
Hey, wait, the way I figure it,

26:31.624 --> 26:33.791
you get some kid in here,
pay him half that,

26:33.793 --> 26:35.759
and no benefits
'cause he's part-time.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.194
Hey, where do I sign?

26:37.196 --> 26:38.762
I can't get there
fast enough.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.799
You think I like
firing people?

26:41.801 --> 26:44.768
You think I enjoy it?
Yeah.

26:44.770 --> 26:45.936
George, she's having
a hard time.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.271
She can't help you.
You stay with me.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.173
I'm the guy who can get you
out of this, okay?

26:49.175 --> 26:51.775
Yeah, right, yeah,
'cause I'm a...

26:51.777 --> 26:53.711
I'm the Boss Bitch.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.647
I'm the Ice Queen.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.751
Oh, you think
I didn't know the nicknames,

27:00.753 --> 27:03.220
hear the whispers?

27:03.222 --> 27:05.356
I am the first one in every day

27:05.358 --> 27:07.358
and the last one out, so I know.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.660
Good for you.

27:09.662 --> 27:13.163
But a year ago, they were going
to close this branch, George,

27:13.165 --> 27:16.634
and 62 people were going
to lose their jobs.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.702
Sixty-two.

27:20.373 --> 27:24.708
I came in, and I worked
everyone hard, yes.

27:24.710 --> 27:29.179
And I worked harder than I
ever have in my entire life.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.715
And in the end...

27:33.853 --> 27:35.686
it still wasn't enough.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.755
It just wasn't.

27:39.025 --> 27:41.925
Seven people had to go.

27:41.927 --> 27:43.394
Those were the numbers.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.264
Not 62.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.700
Seven.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.837
And I am sorry that you
were one of the seven.

27:56.442 --> 27:59.009
I really am, George.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.845
PARKER:
George, George, can you hear me?

28:01.847 --> 28:03.947
We can talk about all of this.

28:03.949 --> 28:05.683
Talking's through--
no more talking.

28:07.420 --> 28:10.354
No more talking.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.192
Where are you going, George?

28:15.194 --> 28:17.127
Where are you going?

28:19.098 --> 28:21.131
What are you doing, George?

28:21.133 --> 28:23.400
(tape peeling)

28:23.402 --> 28:25.002
Put your hands out.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.004
Put your palms
together.

28:29.709 --> 28:32.009
Don't do that, George.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.278
Team One, stand by
for immediate action.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.379
ED:
What's going on, boss?

28:36.348 --> 28:38.348
Just stay ready.

28:38.350 --> 28:39.783
Lean forward.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.218
He's gagging his hostage.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.386
He's dehumanizing her,

28:42.388 --> 28:44.988
so when the time comes,
he can kill her.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.423
You don't want
to kill her, George.

28:46.425 --> 28:47.925
You don't want to kill her.
Stand by.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.795
Wind's at 1:00.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.363
More like 3:00 now.

28:53.365 --> 28:57.434
Flag down the street
in front of the park.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.436
Nice.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.271
Thank you, sir.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.440
Is there a problem, Braddock?

29:03.442 --> 29:06.777
I was right, you know,
about the proper procedure.

29:06.779 --> 29:09.279
Well, that's the lead
negotiator's call to make.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.949
But I was right.
Manual's clear.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.785
You know the boss
wrote the manual?

29:14.787 --> 29:18.122
It's tough not being the
best at something, huh?

29:18.124 --> 29:20.257
I'm trying.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.127
It's not something you can
get out of a textbook.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.995
You've got to learn
how to make the...

29:24.997 --> 29:26.497
I know, I know.
I gotta connect.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.398
Sarge says it
every time.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.301
Then, how come you
don't hear it?

29:33.839 --> 29:35.105
(cell phone ringing)

29:35.107 --> 29:36.840
Parker.

29:36.842 --> 29:38.108
It's Luria.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.877
You at the retirement home?

29:39.879 --> 29:41.478
George's wife has Alzheimer's.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.412
Oh, that's great.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.381
Diagnosis was six months ago.

29:44.383 --> 29:48.152
Early onset usually means
rapid decompensation.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.987
She's in pretty
bad shape.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.156
But now,
there's another problem.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.557
They're going to kick her out.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.525
She doesn't have the money.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.494
Thanks, Doc.

30:13.045 --> 30:16.113
(beeping)

30:17.116 --> 30:19.283
(cell phone ringing)

30:19.285 --> 30:21.418
So, what's going on?
Where's my money?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.420
What I got is two names.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.255
First name is George Orston.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.707
Hard-working guy,

30:26.708 --> 30:28.158
has done everything right
his whole life,

30:28.160 --> 30:30.894
married 25 years to...

30:30.896 --> 30:33.897
here's the second name:
Mary Orston.

30:33.899 --> 30:36.400
A hairdresser,
or she used to be.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.335
Right now,
she's not doing so well.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.371
In a few years,

30:40.372 --> 30:42.406
she might not be able
to do anything at all.

30:42.408 --> 30:45.108
And the kind of place
that she needs to be in

30:45.110 --> 30:46.510
doesn't come cheap.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.479
That sound right, George?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.447
You tell me, Parker, does that
sound all right to you?

30:50.449 --> 30:51.548
No.
No.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.350
No, it doesn't sound right.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.551
Doesn't sound right

30:54.553 --> 30:56.620
that you lose your job
and your insurance

30:56.622 --> 30:59.122
a month
after you find a home for her.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.958
You work hard your whole life,

31:00.960 --> 31:03.126
and something like Alzheimer's
comes along,

31:03.128 --> 31:05.596
and suddenly,
the most important person to you

31:05.598 --> 31:07.397
can't even remember your name;
that's not right.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.565
No.

31:08.567 --> 31:09.633
Neither is what
you're doing, George,

31:09.635 --> 31:12.269
and you know that.
I know.

31:12.271 --> 31:13.537
Look, I tried, Parker.
I've tried.

31:13.539 --> 31:14.972
I've tried to look
for another job,

31:14.974 --> 31:16.506
look for anything.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.208
It ain't happening, okay?

31:18.210 --> 31:20.310
I've looked to try
and get a loan.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.579
But what am I supposed
to do at my age?

31:22.581 --> 31:26.016
It's not exactly easy
out there to find a job.

31:26.018 --> 31:28.385
And then,
let's be realistic about it.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.255
How am I supposed to pay
anybody back? It's stupid.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.390
Okay, so that's it.
I'm at my wit's end right here.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.426
This is my last chance.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.461
I know you're feeling really
alone right now, George, but...

31:37.463 --> 31:39.496
Being alone, that's not
what's scaring me here.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.064
I'll tell you what's scaring me

31:41.066 --> 31:43.433
is my wife gets
kicked out of that home,

31:43.435 --> 31:44.668
and I'm not in a position where

31:44.670 --> 31:46.503
I c-can take care
of her anymore.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.106
That's what's scaring me, okay?

31:49.108 --> 31:52.376
This woman here,
my wife has always

31:52.378 --> 31:53.677
taken good care of me always.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.680
That's the least
I can do.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.548
I got to take
care of her.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.251
I'm...

32:01.253 --> 32:03.553
I'm just trying
to do what's right.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.689
There isn't anybody in the world
who wouldn't understand that.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.925
I'll bet you Ruth's family
would understand that.

32:07.927 --> 32:11.461
(sniffles)

32:11.463 --> 32:13.964
Okay.

32:13.966 --> 32:17.701
Parker, look,
I'll tell you what.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.637
Let me talk, let me talk
to my wife and I'll just...

32:20.639 --> 32:22.606
I'll end this, okay?
It'll be over.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.174
What do you mean "over," George?

32:24.176 --> 32:26.243
What I mean is if you let me
talk to my wife,

32:26.245 --> 32:28.545
I'll come out and I'll bring
Miss Skellar with me, okay?

32:28.547 --> 32:29.980
Just let me talk to my wife.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.148
All right, George, I'll get her.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.149
You hold on.

32:32.151 --> 32:35.385
(dialing)

32:35.387 --> 32:36.987
(cell phone ringing)

32:36.989 --> 32:37.988
(beep)

32:37.990 --> 32:38.989
Luria.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.624
Hey.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.961
So he's ready to come out
once he talks to his wife.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.964
Now, if I let him do it,
he'll probably kill himself.

32:46.966 --> 32:50.701
If I don't, he'll go off,
and I risk losing the hostage.

32:50.703 --> 32:52.569
Hard call.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.271
Put her on the phone.

32:54.273 --> 32:57.574
Okay.

32:57.576 --> 32:58.575
Here, Mary.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.444
(dialing)

33:00.446 --> 33:01.511
Go ahead.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.382
Mary?

33:07.319 --> 33:08.318
Hello?

33:08.320 --> 33:11.688
It's me. It's George.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.424
H-How are you, how are you
feeling, pretty girl?

33:14.426 --> 33:16.560
Where are you?

33:16.562 --> 33:18.362
Oh, I'm just around the corner.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.597
I'm really close by.

33:20.599 --> 33:23.367
So tell me how you're doing.
Tell me how was your day.

33:23.369 --> 33:26.703
All right, I think.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.105
George.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.106
GEORGE:
Yeah?

33:29.108 --> 33:32.342
Did I do something wrong?

33:32.344 --> 33:33.643
You what?

33:33.645 --> 33:35.779
What are you talking about?

33:35.781 --> 33:39.683
It's just... you're not here.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.386
Did I do something
to make you go away?

33:42.388 --> 33:45.455
Is that why I'm alone?

33:48.794 --> 33:52.662
Mary Orston, I just want you
to know one thing, okay?

33:52.664 --> 33:56.800
That anything that ever
went right in my life

33:56.802 --> 33:58.535
is directly due to you.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.670
Now, do you
understand me?

34:00.672 --> 34:04.174
Hey, Mary.

34:04.176 --> 34:07.644
Just want to tell you something.

34:07.646 --> 34:10.080
I'm real, real sorry.

34:10.082 --> 34:12.682
What for?

34:14.653 --> 34:16.787
I got to go now, Mary.

34:16.789 --> 34:17.788
Okay.

34:17.790 --> 34:18.688
Okay.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.558
I love you, George.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.493
(sniffles)

34:23.495 --> 34:25.629
Me, too, pretty girl.

34:25.631 --> 34:26.696
(beep)

34:30.269 --> 34:31.735
(beep)

34:36.742 --> 34:38.809
Okay, give me your hands.

34:46.185 --> 34:49.119
Careful.

34:53.826 --> 34:55.092
(sniffles)

34:55.094 --> 34:56.093
Okay, so go.

34:56.095 --> 34:57.494
You hear me?
Get going.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.628
Get out of here. Go.

34:58.630 --> 34:59.663
What are you gonna do?

34:59.665 --> 35:01.498
Just go. What do you care?

35:01.500 --> 35:04.568
I'm not leaving here
without you, George.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.438
What are you talking about?

35:08.440 --> 35:09.439
Why?

35:09.441 --> 35:11.308
Because I didn't
help you before.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.442
What?

35:12.444 --> 35:13.510
And I can now.

35:13.512 --> 35:15.545
I know if we sit
down together,

35:15.547 --> 35:17.814
we can figure something
out for your wife.
Figure something out.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.649
What are you talking about,
figure something out?
For Mary.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.118
There's nothing to figure out;
I've tried everything.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.636
There's nothing
to figure out.

35:22.637 --> 35:24.153
There's always something
we can look at.

35:24.156 --> 35:26.556
We'll look at early pension
payout options,

35:26.558 --> 35:27.557
insurance.

35:27.559 --> 35:29.626
We'll see what
the bank can do.

35:32.798 --> 35:35.198
That's pretty nice of you.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.199
You mean it?

35:36.201 --> 35:39.136
Yeah.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.504
Okay.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.839
Thanks.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.310
Why are you doing that?

35:47.312 --> 35:49.146
Why am I doing this?

35:50.883 --> 35:52.816
I don't want Mary
to see me coming out.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.056
Keep your hands
up when you're

35:59.057 --> 36:00.457
in front of
the bank, okay?
Okay.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.791
Team One, Sierra One.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.894
I think he's coming out.
Get ready.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.395
That's great. Congratulations.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.830
Negative. Not good.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.865
He said good-bye to his wife
and put his mask back on.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.200
He's coming out armed, Ed.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.286
Do you understand?

36:12.287 --> 36:14.371
Loss of a loved one--
that depersonalizes him and us.

36:14.373 --> 36:15.772
He's looking for
direct confrontation.

36:15.774 --> 36:16.806
He wants us to kill him.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.341
Suicide by cop. Hold fire!

36:18.343 --> 36:19.643
Suicide by cop.

36:22.748 --> 36:23.880
Sierra One, wait on my Scorpio.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.448
Sierra One, copy.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.601
Shouldn't he give a Scorpio now,

36:44.603 --> 36:46.670
in case this guy
comes out shooting?

36:46.671 --> 36:48.738
It's his call. He's got one more
chance to talk the guy down.

36:48.740 --> 36:49.773
And if he can't?

36:49.775 --> 36:52.475
We do our job.

36:55.847 --> 36:56.980
Get those hands up.

36:58.951 --> 37:00.817
GEORGE:
Hands up!
Keep your hands up!

37:05.691 --> 37:07.074
Hang on. Here he comes.

37:07.075 --> 37:08.458
Okay, now see, you're gonna go
down and you're gonna stay down,

37:08.460 --> 37:10.660
'cause they're gonna shoot me,
eh, so get down. Get down.
No.

37:10.662 --> 37:11.661
No.
Get down!

37:11.663 --> 37:12.662
Don't!

37:12.664 --> 37:13.763
Stop!

37:13.765 --> 37:14.864
George.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.633
Hold fire. Hold fire.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.235
I got the solution.

37:18.237 --> 37:19.436
Wait.

37:19.438 --> 37:23.240
George, this isn't right.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.242
You're trying to
make us do something

37:25.244 --> 37:26.743
we don't want to do.

37:27.980 --> 37:29.980
(cocks gun)

37:29.982 --> 37:31.815
Hold fire. He's no killer.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.717
Hold fire.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.022
Not gonna do it, George.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.991
Not gonna
give you

37:40.993 --> 37:42.792
what you want.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.427
Put the gun down.

37:46.465 --> 37:47.764
(whimpering softly)

37:47.766 --> 37:50.400
Please, George.

37:59.645 --> 38:00.777
Take him.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.280
PARKER:
No.

38:03.282 --> 38:04.681
(gunshot)

38:11.923 --> 38:13.890
¶ ¶

38:42.487 --> 38:44.554
¶ ¶

39:13.485 --> 39:15.552
¶ ¶

39:22.594 --> 39:24.661
Mary, I-I didn't...

39:26.598 --> 39:30.467
I didn't know George
maybe as well as I could have.

39:32.437 --> 39:35.638
But I do know
how much he loved you.

39:37.776 --> 39:41.911
And he made sure
that you'll be taken care of

39:41.913 --> 39:43.680
for as long as you need.

39:46.151 --> 39:49.552
That was very important to him.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.658
Why are you so sad?

39:58.964 --> 40:01.398
It's a, it's a beautiful day.

40:03.135 --> 40:05.668
Yeah, it is.

40:05.670 --> 40:06.736
(sniffles)

40:12.611 --> 40:13.777
How you doing?

40:13.779 --> 40:15.228
I don't know.

40:15.229 --> 40:16.678
I've never been questioned
like that before.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.181
Well, it's procedure.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.849
Luria told you
what it was about, right?

40:19.851 --> 40:21.951
Yeah, guy's insurance
wouldn't cover suicide,

40:21.953 --> 40:23.987
but it paid out if he was
killed by a third party.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.156
Lucky me, right?

40:28.059 --> 40:29.926
Guys seen Parker?

40:29.928 --> 40:30.860
Don't know where he is.

40:30.862 --> 40:31.961
Look, we're gonna get changed.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.630
Let's grab a drink.
You earned it.

Hey, Sarge.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.985
Hey.

40:55.987 --> 40:56.986
You okay?

40:56.988 --> 40:58.488
Yeah.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.927

41:14.139 --> 41:16.773
Just trying to figure out

Do you want another
pair of eyes on this?

41:30.121 --> 41:32.989
No, no, I'm... I'm fine.
Thanks.

41:38.163 --> 41:41.698
