00:06.920 --> 00:08.820
Previously on Criminal Minds...

00:08.830 --> 00:09.819
Sergeant Scott?

00:10.830 --> 00:13.378
Last time I saw you,
you were unconscious,

00:13.380 --> 00:15.325
on your way home with a concussion

00:15.330 --> 00:17.662
and a shrapnel wound in your arm.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.161
This is no way for a war hero to live.

00:20.170 --> 00:23.162
It's called New Directions.

00:23.170 --> 00:26.571
It's an outreach center dedicated
to help vets land on their feet.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.911
Welcome home, marine.

00:32.670 --> 00:34.615
My son Thomas and his wife

00:34.620 --> 00:36.827
live on the other side of those hills.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.912
The son you haven't
spoken to in a while?

00:38.920 --> 00:40.569
Nineteen years.

00:40.580 --> 00:42.036
I got a grandson.

00:42.290 --> 00:44.702
I ain't never gonna see him.

00:44.710 --> 00:45.825
Thomas Scott?

00:45.830 --> 00:46.956
Yes.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.416
I'm a friend of your father's.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.822
Come on, focus. Stay with me.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.616
Do not die on me!

01:14.170 --> 01:15.785
Oh, God, come on, damn it.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.376
You can make it.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.871
- -We're almost there. Hang on.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.878
No, no, no, don't. Hold on.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.496
No, don't. Don't.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.537
Okay, wait right here.
I'm gonna get some help.

01:57.540 --> 01:58.746
Thank you.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.115
No.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.786
Thank you.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.377
Yeah. Yeah. I land this afternoon

02:09.380 --> 02:11.871
and then we'll head up to the lake
on Monday.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.780
Yeah, me, too. Can't wait.

02:15.290 --> 02:17.372
Rossi, I'm from
the south side of Chicago, okay?

02:17.380 --> 02:18.870
We don't have fishing ponds.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.451
How can something look so easy

02:21.880 --> 02:23.165
and be so hard?

02:23.170 --> 02:24.785
It's all in your technique,

02:24.790 --> 02:27.998
and all those muscles of yours
won't help in something like this.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.240
It's all in the wrist.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.820
-Oh, the wrist.
-Yeah, yeah.

02:30.830 --> 02:32.957
All right, all right, okay, here we go.
And...

02:32.960 --> 02:35.030
There we go!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

02:35.040 --> 02:36.871
-All right!
-Yeah, boy!

02:36.880 --> 02:37.949
-Okay.
-Whoo!

02:37.960 --> 02:41.327
All right, now, see, all you need
is a little garlic butter

02:41.330 --> 02:45.073
and a 2008 well-chilled bottle
of Pouilly-Fuiss.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.207
Okay, and maybe a...

02:47.210 --> 02:49.075
-A little meat tenderiser wouldn't hurt.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.377
Wow, David Rossi...

02:51.880 --> 02:53.609
Taking time to smell the roses.

02:53.620 --> 02:55.872
You know, this daughter thing
might be paying dividends.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.872
All I'll be smelling is fish guts
for the next couple of days,

02:58.880 --> 03:01.576
but you are absolutely right.

03:01.580 --> 03:04.538
Hey, look, that's the
first fish I ever caught. Give me that.

03:04.540 --> 03:06.280
-You enjoy yourself.
-All righty.

03:09.210 --> 03:10.529
Sir, is your phone not working?

03:10.540 --> 03:13.202
I shut it off. This vacation
is completely unplugged.

03:13.210 --> 03:15.110
No work phone, no laptop...

03:17.960 --> 03:19.450
What's wrong, Penelope?

03:19.460 --> 03:21.576
It's New Directions
for veterans in California.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.536
They tried to call you, but you...

03:25.380 --> 03:27.109
This is David Rossi.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.706
I see.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.241
Well, I appreciate you letting me know.

03:38.460 --> 03:41.702
Um, I'll be out there later today.

03:48.580 --> 03:50.912
Harrison Scott died last night.

03:51.290 --> 03:52.826
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:53.710 --> 03:56.668
Bone cancer.
He never said a word.

03:58.670 --> 04:03.414
I will, uh, be going to Los Angeles
before heading up to San Francisco,

04:03.420 --> 04:05.877
see ifI can be of any help.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.950
Sir, if there's anything I can do...

04:09.330 --> 04:11.707
Well, I would appreciate it, Penelope,

04:11.710 --> 04:14.827
if, uh, you don't tell
the rest of the team about this,

04:14.830 --> 04:16.457
not just yet.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.326
Of course. Whatever you want.

05:02.880 --> 05:07.453
So, now Hotch as well
will not be joining us today.

05:07.460 --> 05:09.371
What's up with Hotch

05:09.380 --> 05:11.450
No. He is going to meet you
at the airport,

05:11.460 --> 05:13.325
and actually, Rossi...

05:16.620 --> 05:18.247
That doesn't matter. Uh...

05:18.250 --> 05:20.070
I am here to present the case.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.958
Three nights ago,
in Tallahassee, Florida,

05:22.960 --> 05:24.780
a woman named Betty Wright

05:24.790 --> 05:27.076
was found shot in front
of Carter Memorial Hospital.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.537
She's currently brain dead.
She's on life support.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.496
Her vehicle was found
10 miles from the location.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.990
Looks like she'd been in an accident.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.161
Do we think the killer
engineered the crash?

05:35.170 --> 05:37.741
That is unlikely.
It appears to be a single-car spinout.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.162
So the UnSub happened upon
the accident by chance

05:40.170 --> 05:41.706
and was taking her to the hospital.

05:41.710 --> 05:44.281
Where a rescue mission _
somehow turned Into an execution.

05:44.290 --> 05:45.780
Unfortunately, there is more,

05:45.790 --> 05:47.872
because yesterday afternoon,
also in Tallahassee,

05:47.880 --> 05:50.701
Cliff Daniels, 38, was found
bludgeoned and shot to death

05:50.710 --> 05:52.701
on the steps of a church,
and ballistics confirm

05:52.710 --> 05:54.746
that the gun was
the same in both shootings.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.877
He leaves his victims
on the doorsteps of places

05:56.880 --> 05:59.451
we think of as a sanctuary.
Church, hospital...

05:59.460 --> 06:01.280
Only to snatch away hope
at the last minute.

06:01.290 --> 06:02.530
Maybe we're dealing with a sadist?

06:02.540 --> 06:03.871
Well, whatever the reason,

06:03.880 --> 06:06.030
this UnSub's killed twice
in less than 48 hours.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.496
Let's get going.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.780
911.
Please state your emergency.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.030
There's been a shooting.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.371
What is your location, sir?

06:21.380 --> 06:23.200
Corner of Hazel and Parkway.

06:23.210 --> 06:24.950
-Sir, if you could just remain...-

07:14.620 --> 07:17.453
"Death is the only god
who comes when you call."

07:17.460 --> 07:19.576
Roger Zelazny.

07:19.580 --> 07:20.877
Both victims were black,

07:20.880 --> 07:22.950
but the similarities
begin and end right there.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.281
Betty Wright was a well-liked
Tallahassee native,

07:25.290 --> 07:26.496
pillar of the community.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.207
Cliff Daniels, on the other hand,
was a shady character from New Jersey

07:29.210 --> 07:30.950
who moved to Florida three months ago.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.416
Yeah, and not for the sunshine.

07:32.420 --> 07:34.661
A Ponzi scheme he'd been
running back east imploded.

07:34.670 --> 07:36.069
Maybe one of the investors
who got burned

07:36.080 --> 07:37.661
came back to Florida for revenge.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.035
-Doesn't explain Betty Wright's murder.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.201
You know, I would love one day
to interrupt you on the jet

07:41.210 --> 07:42.666
to report that a stray puppy

07:42.670 --> 07:44.877
was found and saved
and given the best home ever.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.324
But it's not gonna be today,

07:46.330 --> 07:48.116
because there's been another shooting.
Victor Hall.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.246
Is he black?

07:49.250 --> 07:50.535
Nope. White.

07:50.540 --> 07:51.916
At least that might
eliminate race as a motive.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.616
There was a witness this time,
Peter Goodwin, the victim's shrink.

07:54.620 --> 07:56.281
They'd just finished a session together.

07:56.290 --> 07:58.497
All right, Reid and Kate,
go to the medical examiner.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.458
Morgan, you and JJ talk to
Betty Wright's family at the hospital.

08:01.460 --> 08:04.497
I'll talk to this new witness
and see if he can shed some light.

08:04.790 --> 08:08.248
TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA

08:08.920 --> 08:12.822
Uh, Victor had been in therapy
with me for nearly three years.

08:12.830 --> 08:15.242
And he gave no indication
that he might be in danger?

08:15.250 --> 08:16.911
No, not at all.

08:17.210 --> 08:19.280
He'd been going through a lot recently.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.666
Marriage problems.

08:20.670 --> 08:21.989
A son with drug issues.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.707
And then about two weeks ago,
he was mugged and robbed.

08:25.420 --> 08:28.537
But this, gunned down in the streets...

08:29.080 --> 08:30.786
How did you witness the shooting?

08:31.790 --> 08:33.667
It was the end of our session.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.873
I was tired. I needed a boost.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.996
There's a coffee place down the street.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.070
It was a quiet time of day.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.708
I was checking messages
on my cell phone,

08:43.710 --> 08:46.577
and I just turned around
and saw Victor.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.167
-And where was he?
-At the other end of the block.

08:50.170 --> 08:52.707
There was a man
walking up fast behind him.

08:52.710 --> 08:54.666
Can you describe this person?

08:54.670 --> 08:57.616
White guy. Maybe late 405, early 50s.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.492
He hit Victor across
the back of the head.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.491
What did you do?MAN: I just froze.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.786
I mean, I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

09:05.790 --> 09:07.417
And then I took off to try and help.

09:07.420 --> 09:08.569
What happened next?

09:08.580 --> 09:11.287
The guy crouched down.
That's when I saw the gun.

09:11.290 --> 09:12.746
He pointed it at Victor's head.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.536
-That's when I heard the gunshot.-

09:16.920 --> 09:18.990
And then the guy took off
across the street.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.576
Did he take off on foot
or did he get into a car?

09:21.580 --> 09:22.820
He got into a car.

09:24.420 --> 09:25.660
A gold car.

09:25.670 --> 09:26.876
I didn't get the make or model.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.451
You said that he was
crouched down over Victor.

09:29.460 --> 09:32.748
Yeah. It was like he was
looking for the right place to shoot him.

09:32.750 --> 09:33.990
What do you mean by that?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.036
Well, he was moving the gun
around on Victor's head,

09:36.460 --> 09:38.325
looking for an angle.

09:38.330 --> 09:39.991
He wasn't taking direct aim.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.569
You said you were
checking your cell phone

09:42.580 --> 09:44.161
and then you looked back at Victor.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.327
Was there anything that
made you turn around and look?

09:48.330 --> 09:49.615
Something you saw or heard?

09:50.170 --> 09:52.570
No special reason. I just looked around.

09:52.580 --> 09:54.821
Put yourself back in the moment.

09:54.830 --> 09:56.115
Think carefully.

10:02.460 --> 10:05.031
I heard sirens approaching.

10:06.710 --> 10:09.417
So you heard police sirens
before the actual shooting?

10:09.420 --> 10:12.241
Yes. But that can't be, can it?

10:12.250 --> 10:14.457
I mean, how could the police
be responding

10:14.460 --> 10:16.280
to something that hadn't happened yet?

10:18.540 --> 10:21.327
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

10:21.330 --> 10:23.992
I'll stay and help however I can
and then come up,

10:24.000 --> 10:25.456
two or three days max.

10:25.460 --> 10:26.916
Don't worry about it.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.535
The lake isn't gonna dry up
all of a sudden.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.666
Just take all the time you need.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.456
-You sure?-Yes, absolutely.

10:31.460 --> 10:32.996
We're gonna be fine, Dad.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.166
You there?

10:36.790 --> 10:39.497
I... I'm sorry.
Whenever I hear someone say "Dad,"

10:39.500 --> 10:41.877
I start looking around
to see who they're talking to.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.701
Well, get used to it, Dad.

10:45.460 --> 10:46.700
I'll call you tonight.

10:47.290 --> 10:48.609
Okay.

10:56.540 --> 11:00.283
I appreciate you coming
on such short notice, Mr. Rossi.

11:02.210 --> 11:06.032
It was a pleasure and a privilege
to have known Sergeant Scott.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.200
He'll be missed.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.166
Yes, he will.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.036
These boxes were Harrison's.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.166
His son Thomas said

11:14.170 --> 11:15.819
if you want to start going through them,
it's all right with him.

11:16.420 --> 11:17.739
He should be here soon.

11:17.750 --> 11:18.910
Thank you.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.280
So the gunshot didn't kill Daniels.

11:32.290 --> 11:34.372
_That's correct.
Bullet just grazed the skull.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.666
COD was actually from
the blunt force trauma to the head.

11:36.670 --> 11:38.114
Could you determine
the murder weapon?

11:38.120 --> 11:40.998
No, but there were minute traces
of metal flecks in the scalp.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.742
My guess would be a tire iron,
metal pipe, something like that.

11:43.750 --> 11:46.412
How long had Daniels been dead
when he was discovered at the church?

11:46.420 --> 11:47.660
I'd say five, six hours.

11:47.670 --> 11:49.740
As head trauma goes,
I've seen a lot worse.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.991
Two moderate blows to the temple,
like the killer was weak.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.246
Or he restrained himself.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.070
Is there such a thing as underkill?

11:56.080 --> 11:57.377
There was with this victim.

11:57.380 --> 12:00.247
If the UnSub did hold back,
I wonder why.

12:01.540 --> 12:03.872
My wife,

12:05.670 --> 12:08.207
she lit up any room she walked into.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.609
Now look at her.

12:11.620 --> 12:15.454
These damn machines have got
more life in them than she does.

12:16.420 --> 12:19.241
Mr. Wright,
was Betty carrying anything valuable

12:19.250 --> 12:21.457
the night of her accident

12:22.710 --> 12:24.530
No. Why?

12:24.540 --> 12:25.825
We think
the man who shot your wife

12:25.830 --> 12:27.991
was initially bringing
her here for treatment,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.570
but something changed his mind.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.206
No.

12:32.210 --> 12:35.111
Betty didn't have anything special
with her that night.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.576
Mr. Wright?

12:36.580 --> 12:37.786
We're ready for you.

12:39.830 --> 12:41.741
Got papers to sign.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.116
You think you have years
left with someone,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.241
all the time in the world.

12:55.330 --> 12:57.036
And suddenly you don't.

13:47.210 --> 13:49.075
Still sittin' on your ass, Rossi?

13:50.620 --> 13:52.451
It wasn't my idea, Sergeant.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.286
Got something for you.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.957
I had to bribe Colson
a six-pack to make this happen.

14:06.960 --> 14:07.949
But...

14:17.540 --> 14:19.496
I wanted to make it personal.

14:21.710 --> 14:22.825
I'm proud of you.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.410
Not just for what you did here,

14:26.040 --> 14:28.452
but what you're going to do
in the future.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.991
I expect great things.

14:32.210 --> 14:33.746
Thank you, Sergeant.

14:35.330 --> 14:36.991
I need to heal up first, though.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.206
And when you do, remember,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.707
scars only show us where we've been,

14:43.710 --> 14:46.281
they do not dictate where we are going.

15:03.620 --> 15:05.030
Mr. Rossi.

15:05.460 --> 15:06.950
Thomas.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.570
When did you get in?

15:11.580 --> 15:12.911
Last night.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.952
Had you known
your dad had been sick?

15:16.960 --> 15:18.450
Yeah.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.745
He told me a couple months ago

15:19.750 --> 15:21.957
when it was obvious
something was wrong.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.240
He made me promise not to tell anyone.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.206
Especially you.

15:28.330 --> 15:29.661
I'm sorry.

15:29.670 --> 15:31.285
No, don't be.

15:31.790 --> 15:34.418
Harrison had
his own way of doing things.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.207
Yeah. Stubborn.

15:37.210 --> 15:39.417
I prefer to say

15:39.420 --> 15:40.785
sure of himself.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.535
It's what made him a great leader.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.662
But Dad knew he was dying
for over a year,

15:48.460 --> 15:50.325
even before you came out last time.

15:50.830 --> 15:53.708
That explains his urgency
to reconnect with you,

15:53.710 --> 15:56.827
get to know May, meet his grandson.

15:59.380 --> 16:02.918
The funeral, it's the day after tomorrow.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.531
I'm not even sure
what I'm supposed to do.

16:07.750 --> 16:11.993
If you don't mind, Thomas,
as a fellow marine,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.456
I'd like to take care of it.

16:18.420 --> 16:20.069
It would be my honor.

16:23.830 --> 16:25.161
Those his?

16:26.620 --> 16:27.666
Yeah.

16:30.210 --> 16:32.781
So, uh, which one's you?

16:32.790 --> 16:36.032
Uh, that would be
the handsome one right there.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.820
The last couple of months,

16:39.830 --> 16:41.570
my dad's been trying to
reconnect with these men

16:41.580 --> 16:43.207
who served under him in Vietnam.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.279
Did he have any luck?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.991
No, too much time has passed.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.531
People are hard to find.

16:51.540 --> 16:54.077
Well, let me help you
pack these things up.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.411
Mr. Rossi.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.168
Thank you again

16:59.170 --> 17:01.616
for giving me the time
I did have with my father.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.456
Police are saying Victor Hall

17:05.460 --> 17:07.416
was pronounced dead at the scene.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.320
Tonight, friends and family
of the victim are asking...

17:10.040 --> 17:11.530
Why did you let him die?

17:11.540 --> 17:13.781
-One of Victor's co-workers...-You were right there!

17:13.790 --> 17:14.916
Dad?

17:14.920 --> 17:16.911
And they have no idea
what the motive is behind this killing.

17:18.460 --> 17:19.745
Are you all right?

17:20.500 --> 17:21.990
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just...

17:22.790 --> 17:24.417
The news.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.490
Whole world is going to hell.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.991
It's not healthy for you to
sit back here all the time in the dark.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.279
Did you get your medicine?

17:32.790 --> 17:34.075
This morning.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.325
I'm sorry.

17:38.330 --> 17:39.490
About what?

17:40.920 --> 17:44.071
All those bad years
I put you and Mom through.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.747
The drugs, the everything.

17:48.710 --> 17:50.280
It's in the past.

17:51.420 --> 17:54.287
I just wish your mother
was here to see you now.

17:54.290 --> 17:55.279
The real you.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.575
Timmy's happy.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.537
He wasn't like this
before we moved back home.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.115
You are a lifeline for him.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.536
For both of us.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.497
Everything's gonna be okay, Dad.

18:20.170 --> 18:22.320
It's all gonna work out.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.535
Mommy?

18:39.710 --> 18:42.076
Okay, so the 911 call
on Victor Hall's murder

18:42.080 --> 18:44.537
37 am,

18:44.540 --> 18:46.826
42,

18:46.830 --> 18:48.536
only moments after the shooting.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.076
So the killer
himself made the call.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.116
He alerted the police
before shooting Victor.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.781
It's like he was leaving
open the chance for rescue,

18:53.790 --> 18:55.075
the way he did with Betty Wright.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.742
He's being careful. The call came
from a disposable cell phone

18:57.750 --> 18:58.876
so it couldn't be traced.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.916
Hotch also said
he was careful to place the bullet

19:00.920 --> 19:02.785
so it penetrated the skull at an angle.

19:02.790 --> 19:05.702
Mimics the restrained nature
of the head trauma to Cliff Daniels.

19:05.710 --> 19:07.917
Garcia said she couldn't find
a shred of connective tissue

19:07.920 --> 19:09.069
between any of the victims.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.913
So far, the UnSub staged his murders
in front of a hospital,

19:11.920 --> 19:14.036
a church, and a psychiatrist's office.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.577
He could be making a statement
about body, mind, and soul.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.707
No, no, no.
To me it feels like he's re-enacting,

19:18.710 --> 19:21.531
playing out versions of a near-miss
that happened to him or a loved one.

19:21.540 --> 19:23.667
Or he's an adrenaline junkie.

19:23.670 --> 19:27.322
Killing isn't exciting unless he's walking
that raggedy edge of being caught.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.741
Okay, so let's catch him.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.451
911.
What is your emergency?

20:02.460 --> 20:07.409
Listen. There's a burglary in progress
at 24481 Crescent Circle Drive.

20:08.710 --> 20:10.450
I think someone inside's been hurt.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.661
Damn it!

20:38.580 --> 20:39.660
Hey.

20:39.670 --> 20:41.035
Who the hell are you?

20:41.540 --> 20:43.246
You should have stayed asleep.

20:46.790 --> 20:49.702
Small-calibre weapon and a heads-up
911 call before it happened.

20:49.710 --> 20:51.029
This has to be our guy.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.746
Yeah, and he didn't hold back this time.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.321
First shot was at medium range,
the rest were point-blank.

20:55.330 --> 20:57.116
The victim had been drinking.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.076
Enough painkillers
to start his own pharmacy.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.570
- -What is it, Garcia?

21:00.580 --> 21:02.207
I have a very interesting titbit

21:02.210 --> 21:04.417
regarding the church
Daniels was found at.

21:04.420 --> 21:07.116
They have a very popular
sunrise service there

21:07.120 --> 21:08.246
every morning, no exception,

21:08.250 --> 21:10.821
except for the exception that happened
on the day Daniels was found there.

21:10.830 --> 21:12.616
The pastor had a death in the family.

21:12.620 --> 21:14.167
He had to cancel
the service last-minute.

21:14.170 --> 21:15.376
All right, thanks.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.496
The UnSub must have known
about the sunrise service.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.616
He was expecting Daniels' body
to be found right away.

21:19.620 --> 21:22.248
So the first two victims were placed
where they'd be found quickly,

21:22.250 --> 21:23.786
and the next two victims weren't shot

21:23.790 --> 21:26.452
until the UnSub made sure
that help was on the way.

21:26.460 --> 21:28.075
What's that about?

21:33.540 --> 21:34.916
Dad.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.990
This is Keith, the one I told you about.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.161
-From my group.
-Oh, right.

21:39.170 --> 21:41.286
Right. Keith. I'm sorry.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.667
It's all right, sir.
It's just nice to meet you.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.491
He just came by to visit,
borrow a couple books.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.577
Okay, well, I'm glad that
you two could finally meet.

21:52.330 --> 21:53.456
This way.

22:02.670 --> 22:05.878
Voice recognition confirms
the same person made both 911 calls.

22:05.880 --> 22:08.110
So the only consistency
in all four shootings

22:08.120 --> 22:09.747
is the near rescue component.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.320
What's this guy doing,
daring us to catch him?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.787
No, I think he genuinely
wants his victims to survive.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.660
Well, not the latest victim.

22:15.670 --> 22:17.877
Crawford took one bullet to the head
and five to the chest.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.950
Crawford's the exception.
When the UnSub got inside,

22:19.960 --> 22:22.611
he noticed the severity
of Crawford's substance abuse.

22:22.620 --> 22:24.576
Which made him
unworthy of being saved?

22:24.580 --> 22:25.956
Unworthy, unsuitable.

22:26.380 --> 22:29.747
We need to look at the Betty Wright
surveillance video again.

22:30.420 --> 22:31.785
All right, this is
where the spree started.

22:31.790 --> 22:33.200
The question is, what triggered it?

22:33.210 --> 22:36.782
It doesn't look premeditated,
but he did have a gun.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.451
Well, this is stand-your-ground Florida.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.872
_ Lots of citizens
ride around With weapons.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.872
Up to this point,
he still looks like a good Samaritan.

22:44.290 --> 22:46.576
All right, rewind it to the point
where he puts her up against the tree

22:46.580 --> 22:48.741
and then play it back in slow-motion.

22:51.710 --> 22:52.950
Right there.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.496
His body language changes.

22:55.210 --> 22:56.780
He saw something.

22:57.170 --> 22:58.910
-Can you zoom in on her?
-Mmm-hmm.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.740
Is she wearing a bracelet?

23:07.540 --> 23:08.916
Garcia,
you said that Betty Wright

23:08.920 --> 23:10.456
had been taken off life support, yes?

23:10.460 --> 23:12.371
Yeah. She passed away two hours ago.

23:12.380 --> 23:14.496
But she hasn't been transferred
to the ME. yet, has she?

23:15.210 --> 23:17.451
I don't know how you know that,
but no, she hasn't.

23:17.460 --> 23:20.372
If you give me a nanosecond
I will tell you why that is.

23:20.830 --> 23:22.070
It's because...

23:22.080 --> 23:23.490
It's because her organs
are being recovered.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.660
Her organs are being recovered.

23:25.790 --> 23:28.873
Sir, you frequently amaze me a little,
but sometimes you amaze me a lot.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.201
That's it. Betty Wright was
wearing a MedicAlert bracelet

23:31.210 --> 23:32.780
identifying her as an organ donor.

23:32.790 --> 23:35.281
Garcia, were any of the
other victims organ donors?

23:35.290 --> 23:38.919
Let me see. Uh, yes, yes,

23:38.920 --> 23:41.115
and yes.

23:41.620 --> 23:42.700
Every one.

23:44.420 --> 23:47.036
We believe we're looking for
a white male in his early to mid-505.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.201
He appears to be engineering
murder scenarios

23:49.210 --> 23:51.280
so the victims can be
attended to quickly enough

23:51.290 --> 23:52.746
to have their organs recovered.

23:52.750 --> 23:54.877
All the victims
are registered organ donors.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.030
With Betty Wright,
he saw her MedicAlert bracelet.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.577
We don't know how he learned
about the others yet.

23:59.580 --> 24:01.787
He may need an organ
for himself or a loved one,

24:01.790 --> 24:03.872
but because of the scarcity
of available organs,

24:06.210 --> 24:08.417
If the supply is low, he'll create supply.

24:08.420 --> 24:11.321
Now, with the latest victim,
the killer made a mistake.

24:11.330 --> 24:14.037
Dale Crawford had serious
alcohol and drug issues.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.076
This would have
compromised hIS Vital organs

24:16.080 --> 24:17.877
and made him a poor candidate
for a transplant.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.110
When the killer realized
the mistake he made with Crawford,

24:20.120 --> 24:21.610
the punishment
was cold-blooded murder.

24:24.170 --> 24:25.910
It is possible
that this setback with Crawford

24:27.960 --> 24:29.496
and make him more dangerous.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.535
Thank you.

24:32.210 --> 24:33.245
Hello?

24:34.250 --> 24:35.740
Hi, Dr. Urman.

24:37.170 --> 24:38.205
Yes.

24:41.830 --> 24:43.070
No, I understand.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.996
Thank you for letting me know.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.285
I will.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.326
The liver went to somebody else.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.417
It's not fair.

24:53.420 --> 24:55.911
Dad, there's lots of people
in my position,

24:55.920 --> 24:58.206
and some of them
are even Sicker than I am.

24:58.210 --> 24:59.245
Like Keith.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.700
And they're ahead of me
on the waiting list.

25:01.710 --> 25:02.916
That's just how it is.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.706
How it is does not make it right!

25:05.380 --> 25:07.029
I'm close, though.

25:07.040 --> 25:10.032
Dr. Urman said _
a call could come at any time.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.530
You can't give up hope.

25:17.580 --> 25:19.070
I won't.

25:24.540 --> 25:25.916
I won't.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.206
Yeah, the doctor sounded
really hopeful.

25:32.210 --> 25:35.452
We won't know for certain
till sometime tomorrow, but...

25:35.790 --> 25:38.998
I know. That's why I packed
an overnight kit today.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.029
Yeah.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.241
-Penelope

25:54.250 --> 25:56.115
I'm doing okay. How are things there?

25:56.120 --> 25:57.917
Oh, good. Um, one small thing.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.320
Derek called and he asked
how many fish you caught

26:00.330 --> 26:02.036
and I covered for you like you asked.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.998
But you know how sometimes
my face does that weird twisty thing

26:05.000 --> 26:06.206
when I'm telling a lie and I try to...

26:06.210 --> 26:07.700
-Garcia.-Yes?

26:07.710 --> 26:10.417
I spoke to Hotch earlier today
about Harrison.

26:10.420 --> 26:12.160
He's going to fill in
the rest of the team.

26:12.620 --> 26:13.996
Okay. That's a relief.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.412
Actually, I called to ask a favor.

26:16.420 --> 26:18.035
Yeah, anything. What?

26:18.040 --> 26:19.667
Be honest with me. If you're too busy...

26:19.670 --> 26:20.819
No, I'm not. I swear.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.991
You can't see, but my face isn't doing
that twisty thing at all.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.319
What do you need?

26:24.330 --> 26:25.820
It's nearly impossible
to narrow down

26:25.830 --> 26:27.070
the UnSub's hunting ground.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.457
I mean, any cashier who asked
a customer for their driver's license

26:29.460 --> 26:31.075
is gonna know
that they're an organ donor.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.116
Garcia's checking to see
if all of our victims intersected

26:33.120 --> 26:34.496
at any retail establishments.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.741
On top of that, the north Florida
organ procurement center

26:36.750 --> 26:38.160
is located right here in Tallahassee

26:38.170 --> 26:39.660
and their employees would know,
friends, family.

26:39.670 --> 26:40.955
_ Not to mention _
online donor registration.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.450
I mean, anyone with even
marginal computer skills

26:43.460 --> 26:44.779
could access the database.

26:44.790 --> 26:45.916
We've got another one.

26:50.420 --> 26:53.071
Keith Doheny.
A jogger found him like this.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.241
-Was there a 911 call beforehand?
-Nothing.

26:55.250 --> 26:57.536
Oxygen concentrator.
If he's not in good health,

26:57.540 --> 26:59.667
not exactly a good candidate
for donating organs.

26:59.670 --> 27:01.570
You know,
the victim's severely jaundiced.

27:01.580 --> 27:04.162
He himself could be
in the final stages of liver failure.

27:04.170 --> 27:06.320
So maybe that's it.
Maybe he's not giving organs,

27:06.330 --> 27:07.570
he's in need of one.

27:08.330 --> 27:10.992
You are right on the dinero.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.538
Keith Doheny has been waiting for
a liver transplant since last November.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.076
What's his MELD score?

27:16.080 --> 27:17.490
His what what?

27:17.500 --> 27:19.616
Model for end-stage liver disease.
It's a point system

27:19.620 --> 27:22.498
the United Network for Organ Sharing
uses to determine those most in need.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.785
It's high.

27:23.790 --> 27:25.166
Like right there at the top.

27:25.170 --> 27:27.320
Okay, so if the other murders
were about creating supply,

27:27.330 --> 27:29.036
maybe now he's eliminating demand?

27:29.040 --> 27:31.611
Which means the UnSub
isn't dispersing organs randomly.

27:31.620 --> 27:33.417
He's trying to help one specific person.

27:33.420 --> 27:35.957
One way to do that,
whittle down the competition.

27:40.790 --> 27:42.075
Estelle?

27:43.500 --> 27:45.536
Estelle

27:45.540 --> 27:46.950
Grandpa!

27:47.540 --> 27:48.871
Timmy, what's the matter?

27:48.880 --> 27:50.871
Something's wrong with Mommy.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.320
Estelle!

27:56.080 --> 27:57.707
Estelle!

28:04.000 --> 28:06.491
Garcia's checking
the waiting lists for liver transplants.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.661
Someone's going to benefit
from Keith Doheny's death.

28:08.670 --> 28:10.740
Since the blood types
of the victims are varied,

28:10.750 --> 28:13.207
have her only look
at the universal recipient, AB positive.

28:13.210 --> 28:15.280
You know, if the UnSub
needs the organ for a loved one,

28:15.290 --> 28:17.747
he probably already tried
to make a living donation himself.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.570
The liver has the greatest
regenerative capacity

28:19.580 --> 28:20.956
of any organ in the human body

28:20.960 --> 28:22.916
and a transplanted portion
from a living donor

28:22.920 --> 28:24.876
will grow to full size
in a couple of weeks.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.576
Have Garcia get names of people
who applied to be living donors

28:27.580 --> 28:28.706
but were rejected.

28:28.710 --> 28:30.450
Okay, identifying donors is one thing,

28:30.460 --> 28:32.451
but finding out who was
on a recipient waiting list

28:32.460 --> 28:33.870
is next to impossible.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.029
How did the UnSub manage it?

28:35.040 --> 28:37.076
We need to look at Keith Doheny's
circle of friends.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.320
Support groups, doctors and nurses,

28:38.330 --> 28:40.958
anyone who might be familiar
with his circumstances.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.535
How is she?

28:46.540 --> 28:48.246
Estelle is resting comfortably.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.206
That doesn't tell me a damn thing!

28:50.210 --> 28:51.416
Is she gonna be okay?

28:51.420 --> 28:55.242
Frank, we've always
known the situation.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.490
Time is running out.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.876
As in what?

28:59.620 --> 29:00.746
Hours?

29:01.380 --> 29:04.247
-Days?
-Weeks, hopefully.

29:05.290 --> 29:06.996
But not months.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.242
No, Frank, not months.

29:10.250 --> 29:13.822
But there's always hope
that another liver will come available.

29:14.460 --> 29:16.075
As difficult as it sounds,

29:16.080 --> 29:19.823
it's best to try to resume
your normal life in the meantime.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.570
Dad.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.160
Dad.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.878
Wow, I really do need to re-educate you
about this dad business.

29:29.290 --> 29:31.451
What are you doing here?

29:31.460 --> 29:33.872
There are times when
families should be together,

29:33.880 --> 29:36.246
and this seemed like one of those times.

29:36.750 --> 29:39.492
What... How did you know
to find me here?

29:39.500 --> 29:40.615
L.A.'s a big city.

29:40.620 --> 29:44.283
Remember that "find your friend" app
I put on your cell phone?

29:44.290 --> 29:47.453
It put you directly in front of
New Directions for veterans.

29:48.290 --> 29:49.700
Well, I'm glad you came.

29:49.710 --> 29:51.575
-It's nice to see your face.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.609
So what were you
thinking about just now?

29:54.620 --> 29:56.531
You seemed far away.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.573
My last real conversation with Harrison
was right on this bench.

30:02.710 --> 30:04.200
Conversation about what?

30:05.250 --> 30:07.821
About what a screw-up I was
when I enlisted.

30:08.380 --> 30:11.531
I was a real hothead back then.
I didn't have a clue.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.036
It's hard to picture you like that.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.951
Oh, picture it, trust me.

30:16.830 --> 30:19.913
But Sergeant Harrison Scott
straightened me out.

30:20.710 --> 30:23.918
Before him,
I was on a fast train to nowhere.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.247
Sounds like my mother wouldn't have
given the old David Rossi

30:27.250 --> 30:28.376
the time of day.

30:28.380 --> 30:30.917
-Oh, God, no, not_in a million years.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.418
Well, then I guess you could say

30:37.040 --> 30:41.283
that since Harrison Scott_
made you and my mom p055ible,

30:41.710 --> 30:43.610
he sort of made me possible.

30:44.250 --> 30:46.571
Yeah. I guess you could.

30:47.420 --> 30:49.035
Hey. How about some lunch?

30:49.040 --> 30:52.453
I know a great Italian place on Pico,
and they play nothing but Tony Bennett.

30:52.460 --> 30:53.745
Yeah, sounds great.

30:53.750 --> 30:57.117
I'm not very familiar with Tony Bennett,
but if you like him, I'm sure he's okay.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.071
"Okay"

31:00.080 --> 31:01.411
"Okay"?

31:02.000 --> 31:03.740
Obviously, my dear,

31:03.750 --> 31:05.377
this re-education thing

31:05.380 --> 31:07.496
-is going to be a_two-way street.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.458
All right, thanks, baby girl.
Let me know if you find anything.

31:11.250 --> 31:13.912
Garcia's not having much luck
with the recipient list.

31:15.170 --> 31:16.489
Hotch?

31:17.580 --> 31:19.707
Maybe we need to go back
and focus again on how the UnSub

31:19.710 --> 31:21.530
knew that the first four victims
were organ donors.

31:21.830 --> 31:23.991
We've been down that road.
It's a cast of thousands.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.742
It includes every employee
of every retail establishment in the area.

31:26.750 --> 31:29.492
Dale Crawford, the substance abuser,
you have his file?

31:30.250 --> 31:31.285
Yeah.

31:35.290 --> 31:38.032
Temporary driver's license.
It only expired a month ago.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.496
Okay, so what are you thinking?

31:39.500 --> 31:41.707
Cliff Daniels,
the victim who was found at the church,

31:41.710 --> 31:43.029
recently moved
to Florida from New Jersey,

31:43.040 --> 31:44.576
and Victor Hall had his wallet stolen.

31:44.580 --> 31:46.821
Meaning he would have to have
his driver's license replaced.

31:46.830 --> 31:48.661
And Daniels would have to
trade in his New Jersey license

31:48.670 --> 31:49.785
for a Florida one.

31:49.790 --> 31:51.109
The DMV.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.416
Is that it, then?

32:01.210 --> 32:03.417
Hey, I said, am I done here or what?

32:05.790 --> 32:07.667
Yes, I'm sorry. You're done.

32:07.670 --> 32:10.321
Like I got nothin' else to do all day.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.876
Next.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.700
Hey, talk to me, mama.

32:15.710 --> 32:17.746
Frank Cosgrove
works at the DMV branch

32:17.750 --> 32:21.117
smack dab in the middle _
of the geo zone where our Victims lived.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.611
He has a daughter, Estelle,
blood type AB positive,

32:23.620 --> 32:26.248
who's on the recipient list
for a liver transplant.

32:26.250 --> 32:29.208
She goes to a support group
attended by a Keith Doheny.

32:29.210 --> 32:33.579
Frank Cosgrove did indeed try to
make a living donation six months ago,

32:33.580 --> 32:35.787
but he was medically rejected
due to high blood pressure.

32:35.790 --> 32:37.872
If there is an UnSub box
that hasn't been checked,

32:37.880 --> 32:39.029
I'm not finding it.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.246
An address, Garcia.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.956
Work and home on its way.

33:01.540 --> 33:02.916
It's not necessary to smile.

33:06.170 --> 33:08.661
You'll receive your license
in three to five weeks.

33:14.290 --> 33:15.871
The DMV where Frank Cosgrove
works is nearby.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.609
We're trying to confirm he's there today.

33:21.120 --> 33:24.578
If everyone could just wait
a minute or two, we'll take care of you.

33:24.580 --> 33:26.821
Janice, there's a call for you.

33:26.830 --> 33:28.240
It's the FBI.

33:31.250 --> 33:32.410
Can I help you?

33:32.420 --> 33:33.819
Is Frank Cosgrove working today?

33:33.830 --> 33:36.958
Yeah, but he just took off
right in the middle of a shift.

33:37.880 --> 33:40.531
Okay, do you know who
the last customer is he served?

33:40.960 --> 33:44.452
It looks like it was a woman
named Carol Murray. Why?

33:44.460 --> 33:45.666
Okay, this is important.

33:45.670 --> 33:47.911
Does it say anywhere
that she's an organ donor?

33:48.790 --> 33:50.280
Yes, she is.

33:54.380 --> 33:57.417
No, I just finished with the DMV
and now I'm heading to the store.

33:57.420 --> 33:59.320
What do you and the kids
feel like for dinner?

33:59.330 --> 34:01.992
-Come on. Come on, come on, pick up.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.326
Have the operator break in.

34:04.330 --> 34:06.378
Well, you'll just have to wait and see.

34:06.380 --> 34:07.950
-That's the fun of it.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.780
There's an emergency call
trying to get through.

34:09.790 --> 34:11.246
Please clear the line.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.457
Oh, my God, Greg, I have to hang up.

34:15.500 --> 34:16.660
Hello?

34:16.670 --> 34:17.785
Carol Murray?

34:17.790 --> 34:19.280
Yes. Who is this?

34:19.290 --> 34:21.918
This is Agent Jareau
and Agent Morgan with the FBI,

34:21.920 --> 34:24.206
and I need you to stay calm
and listen to me carefully.

34:24.210 --> 34:25.416
FBI?

34:25.420 --> 34:26.569
Ma'am, where are you?

34:26.580 --> 34:28.662
I'm outside the DMV. What's going on?

34:28.670 --> 34:32.743
Okay, Carol, I need you to walk back
into the DMV as if nothing is wrong.

34:32.750 --> 34:33.876
Okay.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.745
-Just stay right there.-

34:37.000 --> 34:38.319
Carol?

34:38.330 --> 34:39.740
Carol, are you there?

34:40.500 --> 34:41.910
- -Please don't hurt me.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.114
Please!

34:46.000 --> 34:48.377
Please.
FRANK: Quiet.

34:48.380 --> 34:50.416
Frank Cosgrove, FBI!

34:50.420 --> 34:52.570
Drop that weapon,
put your hands in the air.

34:52.580 --> 34:54.070
One step and I'll shoot her.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.377
We know about your daughter.

34:55.380 --> 34:56.995
This is not the solution.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.116
Keep Estelle out of this!

34:59.880 --> 35:01.700
She's 23 years old.

35:02.670 --> 35:04.615
A mother. She deserves to live.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.781
The woman you're holding
is also a mother.

35:07.790 --> 35:09.746
Frank, you don't
want this to be your legacy.

35:10.330 --> 35:13.117
Estelle wouldn't want this.
You know she wouldn't.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.667
Drop the weapon.

35:24.620 --> 35:25.917
Forgive me.

35:35.380 --> 35:36.699
Where am I?

35:36.710 --> 35:38.450
You're going into surgery, Estelle.

35:38.460 --> 35:40.030
Everything's gonna be fine.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.916
My wife.
They said she was in a shooting.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.569
I'm sorry, sir, what is your name?

35:55.580 --> 35:58.743
Greg Murray. The police said
she'd been taken to the hospital, and I...

35:58.750 --> 36:00.206
Mr. Murray?

36:05.500 --> 36:06.956
Oh, thank God.

36:12.790 --> 36:15.202
Frank, you don't
want this to be your legacy.

36:15.210 --> 36:18.077
Estelle wouldn't want this.
You know she wouldn't.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.707
Drop the weapon.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.075
Forgive me.

36:40.710 --> 36:42.496
Yeah, that's great.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.570
Okay, thank you.

36:47.670 --> 36:49.490
Estelle's transplant was a success.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.702
Do you think she'll ever find out
that she has her father's liver?

36:52.710 --> 36:54.701
Well, the directive
that was in Cosgrove's desk

36:54.710 --> 36:56.575
said that the donor
would remain anonymous.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.536
She's gonna
know he was a killer, though,

36:58.540 --> 37:01.327
and why he was doing it.
The math can't be that hard.

37:01.330 --> 37:04.572
No, but as we know, there's some truths
the brain refuses to process.

37:05.580 --> 37:07.457
I wonder how Rossi's doing.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.706
This is more than I was expecting.

37:40.420 --> 37:43.912
Every marine is entitled
to a funeral with full honors.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.490
You just have to ask.

37:46.210 --> 37:49.668
Plus a couple of three-stars
from my cigar club in DC.

37:49.670 --> 37:52.321
wanted to fly in to be part of this.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.324
And them?

37:56.880 --> 38:01.283
Those gentlemen are who are left
from your father's squad in Vietnam.

38:01.290 --> 38:03.076
How'd you find them so quickly?

38:03.960 --> 38:08.283
Someday I'll introduce you
to one Penelope Garcia.

38:28.170 --> 38:29.205
Flag!

38:41.420 --> 38:44.492
On behalf of the President
of the United States,

38:44.500 --> 38:47.708
the Commandant of the Marine Corps,
and a grateful nation,

38:47.710 --> 38:52.249
please accept this flag as a token
of our appreciation

38:52.250 --> 38:55.287
for your loved one's service
to country and corps.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.877
"As life runs on,

40:33.880 --> 40:36.917
"the road grows strange
with faces new

40:36.920 --> 40:41.698
"and near the end, the milestones
into headstones change,

40:41.710 --> 40:44.918
"'neath every one a friend."

40:45.290 --> 40:47.451
James Russell Lowell.
