Where have you been?

01:04.123 --> 01:05.305
Sorry, Pilates ran long

01:05.457 --> 01:08.233
and I was just dying
for a pink macaroon.

01:09.128 --> 01:10.961
-Kidding.
-Not funny, Ainsley.

01:11.054 --> 01:12.554
It's not not funny.

01:12.648 --> 01:15.816
It was impossible to leave work.
They have me on air every hour.

You know. Dad.

01:17.227 --> 01:20.287
And you're also

01:21.140 --> 01:22.639
You watch my reports?

01:22.658 --> 01:23.824
Don't get cocky.

01:23.976 --> 01:26.660
Well, something
I haven't reported yet.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.830
A source tells me that Capshaw
is claiming Malcolm

01:29.924 --> 01:31.423
was Dad's accomplice.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.150

<i> I thought he would save me,</i>

01:36.097 --> 01:39.156
All he cared about
was his father.

01:39.174 --> 01:41.842
I knew it
the moment he looked at me.

01:41.936 --> 01:44.828
With those...

01:44.847 --> 01:46.730
cruel eyes.

01:47.833 --> 01:48.941
GIL:
You buying this?

01:49.092 --> 01:51.351
She's wrong about Bright.

01:51.503 --> 01:53.612
Our boy's crazy,
but not that crazy.

01:53.763 --> 01:55.114
Good.

01:55.265 --> 01:57.282
We all know she's lying.

01:58.344 --> 02:01.011
The problem is,
we're the only ones.

02:01.029 --> 02:02.621
(door opens)

02:06.702 --> 02:09.110
Hello, sleepyhead.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.214
BRIGHT:
You drugged me? Where are we?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.708
What did you do?

02:14.860 --> 02:16.026
You said "run," so I ran.

02:16.044 --> 02:18.137
I didn't say take me with you.

02:18.288 --> 02:20.530
Well, you had
a pulmonary embolism.

02:20.624 --> 02:21.807
I was saving your life.

02:22.034 --> 02:24.184
Uh, you're welcome.

02:25.037 --> 02:27.479
Whoa, easy, easy.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.723
Now, look,

02:29.817 --> 02:31.633
I want to untie you, my boy.

02:31.652 --> 02:36.155
We need to discuss how we get
out of this whole imbroglio.

02:36.306 --> 02:38.139
I'm not getting you
out of anything.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.717
We are the victims here,
Malcolm.

02:40.736 --> 02:43.478
That woman abducted me.
Almost killed you.

02:43.572 --> 02:47.499
And, if she's smart...

02:49.152 --> 02:51.170
She'll tell them I was
part of the whole thing.

02:51.321 --> 02:52.654
You're in a pickle.

02:52.748 --> 02:55.081
I need to call Gil,
tell him the whole story.

02:55.234 --> 02:57.401
Look, look, Gil's great and all,

02:57.419 --> 03:00.086
but right now it's your word
against hers.

03:00.239 --> 03:01.722
Who would you believe?

03:06.762 --> 03:08.854
Can we talk? Hmm?

03:09.005 --> 03:10.439
Just for a second?

03:14.177 --> 03:16.278
You look ridiculous.

03:17.198 --> 03:20.014
I look great. I'm incognito.

03:20.034 --> 03:23.202
You know,
a little dirty blond hair dye

03:23.353 --> 03:26.112
and some styling and voilà.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.523
I'm a mountain man,
named Claire.

03:28.617 --> 03:31.043
I've always respected men
with lady names.

03:31.194 --> 03:33.954
What do you think?
Uh, too blond? Too dirty?

03:34.106 --> 03:35.214
Too insane.

03:35.365 --> 03:38.550
Okay, forget it.
Now, I've got a plan.

03:38.702 --> 03:42.946
I mean, it's a little crazy,
but the best ones usually are.

03:42.965 --> 03:44.539
No. There's no plan.

03:44.633 --> 03:48.785
I'm not your friend
and I'm not working with you.

03:48.878 --> 03:49.895
I'm bringing you in.

03:50.122 --> 03:52.397
Okay, just hear me out.

03:53.459 --> 03:56.526
Trust your old man for once.

03:59.982 --> 04:01.314
I didn't kill you.

04:01.467 --> 04:03.617
That's got to count
for something, right?

04:05.079 --> 04:07.537
<i> (phone ringing)</i>

You've got to be kidding me.

04:46.528 --> 04:47.861
Mmm.

04:47.955 --> 04:52.291
Oh, how I have missed nougat.

04:52.442 --> 04:54.184
(distant train whistle blows)

04:54.277 --> 04:55.685
(inhales sharply)
Hmm.

04:55.704 --> 04:58.112
Welcome to Maple Mountain.
Nice, huh?

04:58.132 --> 05:00.206
Why are we in Vermont?

05:00.359 --> 05:03.343
Why<i> aren't</i> we in Vermont?
It's the best.

05:04.696 --> 05:07.047
I told your mother I'd like
to grow old here,

05:07.199 --> 05:08.623
you know, in a cabin

05:08.642 --> 05:12.960
big enough to have
all the grandchildren visit.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.295
(laughs softly)

05:14.389 --> 05:17.399
That dream's as dead
as your 23 victims.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.711
Yeah, you're probably right.

05:21.730 --> 05:23.213
I'm absolutely right.

05:23.231 --> 05:29.161
Look, you know,
it's almost 25 years since that.

05:30.497 --> 05:34.741
Don't you ever think
it's possible that I changed?

05:34.893 --> 05:37.911
You said that in your message.

05:38.063 --> 05:39.579
You're not a killer anymore.

05:39.731 --> 05:41.081
Bingo.

05:41.175 --> 05:44.659
And I have got a way
to prove it.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.303
(sighs)

05:50.166 --> 05:51.666
BRIGHT: You want to find
a missing woman?

05:51.685 --> 05:54.244
-That's your brilliant plan?
-If we find this woman

05:54.262 --> 05:57.430
and the guy who took her,
it'll prove your innocence

05:57.583 --> 06:02.510
and maybe, just maybe,
redeem your old man.

06:02.529 --> 06:07.699
For I believe that Jeannie
Larkin has been abducted by...

06:07.926 --> 06:10.427
-The Woodsman.
-The Woods-- Wha...?

06:10.520 --> 06:13.780
You ruined my big thing.
How did you know?

06:13.932 --> 06:17.859
I worked The Woodsman case
at the Bureau for years.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.120
She matches his victimology,

06:20.214 --> 06:23.048
we're in the right region...

06:23.199 --> 06:24.608
and he's overdue.

06:24.701 --> 06:27.052
Well, it looks like I picked
the right man for the job.

06:27.279 --> 06:30.204
And I know something
a-you don't.

06:30.224 --> 06:33.708
The Woodsman lives here
in this town.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.635
-How do you know that?
-Well, that's intel

06:35.787 --> 06:39.289
for someone
who's not gonna call Gil Arroyo

06:39.307 --> 06:41.625
the first chance he gets.

06:42.644 --> 06:44.794
BRIGHT: Jeannie's
been missing for 12 days.

06:44.813 --> 06:48.148
The Woodsman holds his victims
for two weeks, then kills them.

06:48.300 --> 06:52.577
But we could save her. Together.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.747
Oh. Oh, hey, yoo-hoo!

06:55.899 --> 06:57.231
Oh, God, we've been spotted.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.309
-(laughs): Hey!
-Claire. I was looking for you.

06:59.402 --> 07:01.903
I got that fax
you were expecting.

07:02.030 --> 07:05.072
Oh, thanks a mil, Gary.

07:05.092 --> 07:09.152
Oh, and, uh,
this is my partner Cameron.

07:09.245 --> 07:11.263
Oh. Welcome to Maple Mountain.

07:11.414 --> 07:13.765
You two have a great one, okay?

07:16.270 --> 07:19.679
-You got a fax?
-Mm, impressive, right?

07:19.831 --> 07:22.849
There's no way cops are gonna be
monitoring an old fax machine.

07:23.001 --> 07:26.186
Listen, I am going to prove

07:26.338 --> 07:28.780
that I am a changed man,
Malcolm.

07:29.007 --> 07:30.490
Even if it kills me.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.326
But first...

07:33.954 --> 07:35.620
...pancakes.

07:42.612 --> 07:47.023
MARTIN:
Oh! (laughs)

07:47.116 --> 07:49.468
Mmm! Oh, my boy, my boy, my boy.

07:49.619 --> 07:52.378
You do not know
how long it's been

07:52.531 --> 07:56.123
since I had real maple syrup.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.868
-(laughs)
-Please stop.

07:58.887 --> 08:01.295
These letters seem authentic.

08:01.389 --> 08:03.890
I-I remember
The Woodsman's cursive.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.042
The loops on his Gs.

08:06.061 --> 08:07.393
Whimsical, yet precise.

08:07.488 --> 08:11.323
I've always been aroused
by good penmanship.

08:11.550 --> 08:15.494
Suppose I'm a little bisexual
in that respect.

08:16.980 --> 08:17.979
No, you're not.

08:18.073 --> 08:19.572
All right, each of these letters

08:19.666 --> 08:21.407
was sent from a different town.

08:21.560 --> 08:25.319
He used every zip code within
his kill radius, except one.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.823
Maple Mountain.
That's how I knew he was here.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.008
That's smart.

08:30.159 --> 08:31.343
Well, I try.

08:31.570 --> 08:34.087
He's a bit off-putting,
don't you think?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.830
Total misogynist.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.349
Boastful.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.667
-I mean, it's a lot.
-Mm. He wants your approval.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.094
He's craving it.

08:41.246 --> 08:43.671
So, I've worked
this case for years,

08:43.765 --> 08:46.007
almost lost my mind over it,
and you never thought...

08:46.026 --> 08:47.192
To tell you?

08:47.343 --> 08:50.103
Oh, I called every number
at the FBI.

08:50.255 --> 08:52.255
You wanted nothing
to do with me.

08:52.274 --> 08:55.367
You had such anger issues.

08:55.518 --> 08:56.760
Still do.

08:56.778 --> 08:59.538
WOMAN:
Uh-huh. We're open
from 9:00 to 5:00.

08:59.765 --> 09:00.613
Okay.

09:00.766 --> 09:02.499
No problem.

09:07.105 --> 09:08.288
Thinking about calling me in?

09:08.440 --> 09:12.033
-Yes.
-There's no time, my boy.

09:12.127 --> 09:13.793
The Woodsman is consistent.

09:13.945 --> 09:15.220
In two days,

09:15.447 --> 09:19.057
he will drag
little Jeannie into the forest,

09:19.208 --> 09:20.967
cleave through her chest
with a lumberjack's hook

09:21.061 --> 09:24.229
and plant
a sapling on her grave.

09:24.456 --> 09:25.379
And say what you will,
but his commitment

09:25.399 --> 09:27.524
to reforestation is admirable.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.735
You got something?

09:30.887 --> 09:32.720
What?

09:32.739 --> 09:34.147
His word choice.

09:34.299 --> 09:35.965
"Pulseless non-breathing,"

09:35.984 --> 09:38.493
"rovers" instead of radios.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.080
"Last seen wearing."

09:42.231 --> 09:44.824
He uses law enforcement jargon.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.976
The FBI were always convinced

09:46.995 --> 09:48.736
The Woodsman was
an unhinged drifter,

09:48.830 --> 09:50.071
but that never made sense to me.

09:50.165 --> 09:52.148
-How so?
-It was his method.

09:52.167 --> 09:54.926
Planting a sapling
on the bodies.

09:55.078 --> 09:57.078
Literally laying down roots.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.823
Made me think that he was
part of a community.

09:59.841 --> 10:01.248
An upstanding citizen.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.935
-Maybe even...
-A cop?

10:04.087 --> 10:05.753
Yeah.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.940
I'll check in with local PD,
see if anyone fits the profile.

10:09.167 --> 10:10.942
Great.
Let me hit the head and then...

10:11.094 --> 10:12.426
No. No.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.113
We're taking you back to
the motel and I'm tying you up.

10:15.264 --> 10:18.967
If you want my trust,
you have to earn it.

10:19.027 --> 10:21.845
You realize that plan is crazy.

10:21.863 --> 10:24.364
Well, the best ones usually are.

10:25.608 --> 10:27.517
RUIZ:
I'm putting out a BOLO
on Malcolm Bright.

10:27.610 --> 10:29.944
You can't do that.
The media will crucify him.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.612
You might as well issue
a shoot-on-sight order.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.023
Oh, good call. I didn't know
we still did those.

10:34.042 --> 10:35.717
Ruiz.

10:37.045 --> 10:39.137
(panting)

10:39.330 --> 10:40.472
This isn't a joke.

10:40.623 --> 10:42.382
I've known Bright
since he was ten years old.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.550
He's got his demons,
but he's not his father.

10:44.703 --> 10:47.553
If he's still alive,
he's our best chance

10:47.648 --> 10:49.038
-to bring in The Surgeon.
-Lieutenant Arroyo...

10:49.132 --> 10:51.149
I'll stake my career on it.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.543
Please. Give him a chance.

10:53.636 --> 10:57.280
If another body drops, I'm not
answering for it. You are.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.288
Come on, kid,
where the hell are you?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.224
BRIGHT:
Any updates on The Surgeon?

11:08.317 --> 11:09.392
BROOKS:
Nope.

11:09.411 --> 11:11.628
Just that he might
have a hostage.

11:13.081 --> 11:14.756
There's no name yet.

11:16.067 --> 11:18.009
Damn, his daughter's smoking.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.904
Maybe you can help me.

11:20.997 --> 11:22.572
I work with the NYPD.

11:22.665 --> 11:25.791
I'm here in town
about a missing person.

11:25.944 --> 11:27.410
Jeannie Larkin.

11:27.429 --> 11:30.522
You look like the kind of guy
who might know about her case.

11:30.749 --> 11:32.098
You better talk to the sheriff.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.567
She's back here. Come on.

11:37.105 --> 11:40.514
So, why does a fancy cop
out of New York

11:40.608 --> 11:43.276
come all the way up here
for a missing person case?

11:43.428 --> 11:47.188
Well, Sheriff Cooley,
I think I know who took her.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.782
Call me Fern.
Everyone else does.

11:49.935 --> 11:52.043
So, who you thinking?

11:52.195 --> 11:54.212
-The Woodsman?
-You suspect him, too?

11:54.439 --> 11:57.865
Not really,
but around these parts,

11:57.959 --> 11:59.959
he gets blamed for everything,

12:00.111 --> 12:03.279
from B and E's
to missing bird feeders.

12:03.298 --> 12:05.114
Woodsman sure does
get around, huh?

12:05.133 --> 12:06.966
(Fern chuckles, gasps)

12:07.118 --> 12:11.137
Don, you brought egg salad.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.289
Mmm.
(chuckles)

12:13.382 --> 12:15.382
Sorry. The missus and I have

12:15.477 --> 12:17.068
a standing lunch date
every Friday.

12:17.220 --> 12:19.386
After two kids
and 20 years of marriage,

12:19.481 --> 12:22.298
-it's what keeps us going.
-Mm-hmm.

12:22.391 --> 12:24.242
Um, so what do you think
happened to her?

12:24.393 --> 12:28.913
Well, Jeannie Larkin's family
sent her out here to get sober,

12:29.065 --> 12:30.823
and I bet it didn't work.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.400
She'll show up back home
when she runs out of money.

12:33.495 --> 12:36.145
I mean, that's my hunch,
anyways.

12:36.164 --> 12:38.147
DON:
Seems like a nice girl.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.924
You sure you shouldn't ask him?

12:40.151 --> 12:41.426
Ask who?

12:41.653 --> 12:42.594
Of course.

12:42.821 --> 12:45.004
Never hurts to shake
the trees a little.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.289
Hey, Crutch!

12:48.268 --> 12:50.994
Deputy Crutchfield's
our resident expert.

12:51.087 --> 12:57.108
He's been at, um, what, three
of The Woodsman crime scenes?

12:57.335 --> 12:59.519
Weren't those
in different jurisdictions?

12:59.613 --> 13:01.946
Worked for a few sheriffs
over the years,

13:02.173 --> 13:04.765
but never too far from home.

13:04.859 --> 13:06.100

13:06.119 --> 13:08.328

13:12.959 --> 13:15.210
Oh, please, Gil. Say something.

13:16.463 --> 13:20.131
Capshaw was harboring
a fugitive, called you

13:20.283 --> 13:22.041
and you didn't tell anyone?

13:22.193 --> 13:25.044
(sighs)
I was weak.

13:25.196 --> 13:28.455
But I have wanted to be
free of him for so long.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.141
Do you know how many crimes
you just admitted to?

13:30.293 --> 13:32.310
I will make a statement,

13:32.537 --> 13:34.312
tell them everything,
consequences be damned.

13:34.539 --> 13:36.463
We don't have
that leverage anymore.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.526
She's already the victim.
That's the way they all see it.

13:41.137 --> 13:42.545

anything, it's that...

13:55.836 --> 13:58.244
...we have to learn
from our mistakes.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.548

14:25.699 --> 14:28.032
You were there when they found
Melanie Stapleton.

14:28.184 --> 14:31.619
That's four crime scenes,
not three.

I have Jeannie Larkin

37:43.911 --> 37:46.263

37:47.824 --> 37:49.432
We're 200 yards

37:49.584 --> 37:52.936
from a hunting cabin
off Highway 3.

GIL:
She's lawyered up, but we got

38:14.126 --> 38:16.501
enough to put her away.

38:18.538 --> 38:20.355
You did good, Jess.

38:20.448 --> 38:22.632
Oh, I couldn't have done it
without you.

38:22.784 --> 38:24.025
(laughs softly)

38:24.044 --> 38:25.802
Or my formidable tolerance

38:26.029 --> 38:28.212
for painkillers.
(chuckles)

38:28.365 --> 38:31.182
Maybe I need to work on that.

38:33.203 --> 38:35.795
I want to see some things

Should I go?

38:45.657 --> 38:48.066
Uh... 'cause it's
getting a little steamy.

38:48.218 --> 38:50.068
(laughs):
Yeah, I should, I should go.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.719
What do you have, Edrisa?

38:51.738 --> 38:53.221
Right.

38:53.314 --> 38:57.559
Uh, I got my hands
on Capshaw's old medical files.

38:57.652 --> 39:02.063
N-No reason to dwell
on the legality of it all.

39:02.156 --> 39:04.507
I thought she scrubbed them.

39:04.659 --> 39:05.592
She tried.

39:06.828 --> 39:08.327
I have reason to believe

39:08.347 --> 39:10.513
that Capshaw is responsible
for at least

39:10.665 --> 39:14.258
11 deaths during her tenure
at eight hospitals.

39:14.411 --> 39:15.352
Whoa.

39:15.579 --> 39:18.605

liked her so much.
