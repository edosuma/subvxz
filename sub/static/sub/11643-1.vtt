00:49.560 --> 00:52.439
This is it.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.639
This is your chance to
do something positive.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.679
Give something back.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.239
You can help people,

00:59.240 --> 01:02.479
you can really make a different
difference to people's lives.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.879
That's what community
service is all about.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.039
There are people who think you're scum.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.799
You have an opportunity
to show them they're wrong.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.759
Yeah, but what if they're right?

01:13.760 --> 01:17.679
No offence. But I'm thinking some
people are just born criminals.

01:17.680 --> 01:18.879
Are you looking to get stabbed?

01:18.880 --> 01:20.439
Are you looking to get
stabbed? You see my point?

01:20.440 --> 01:23.119
It doesn't matter what
you've done in the past.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.959
Doing my community service. Hey.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.559
Doing my community service.
Hey. Boring as fuck.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.039
I'm still talking here.

01:28.040 --> 01:28.999
I thought you'd finished.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.239
If my lips are moving,
I'm still talking.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.359
Yeah, but you could have
been yawning, or chewing.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.039
End the call. Hang up!

01:36.040 --> 01:36.919
My probation worker...

01:36.920 --> 01:38.559
You all right there, weird kid?

01:38.560 --> 01:41.199
Don't be disgusting. Call you later.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.199
I'll rip at your throat
and shit down your neck.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.839
We need to work as ateam
here. Hey, that's enough.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.559
Can I move to a different group?

01:50.560 --> 01:52.639
What makes you think
you're better than us?

01:52.640 --> 01:53.719
What is that accent?

01:53.720 --> 01:54.679
Is that for real?

01:54.680 --> 01:56.319
What, are you trying to say something?

01:56.320 --> 01:58.359
It's... That's just a noise.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.239
Are we supposed to be
able to understand her?

02:00.240 --> 02:01.559
Do you understand that?

02:01.560 --> 02:03.159
I think she likes me!?

02:03.160 --> 02:04.959
Hey, pack it in.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.359
It's love, man! What?

02:06.360 --> 02:10.359
Do it, man, do it. You're
a prick, man, look at you.

02:11.080 --> 02:15.079
You're a fuckin' pussy,
bruv. He's taking the piss!

03:03.040 --> 03:06.919
Oh man, there's paint on
my cap. This is bullshit.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.719
Ooh!

03:17.760 --> 03:19.399
I know you.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.959
No, you don't.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.359
Yes I do. You're that runner guy.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.199
You screwed up big time.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.719
You noticed, yeah?

03:27.720 --> 03:29.399
Thanks for reminding me.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.399
I'm guessing shoplifting? No?

03:33.840 --> 03:36.199
Don't act like you
know me, cos you don't.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.399
I'm just making conversation.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.759
This is a chance to network
with other young offenders.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.639
We should be swapping
tips. Brainstorming.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.359
Come on, what did you do?

03:46.360 --> 03:49.559
A girl called me a slag
so I just got into a fight.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.359
Was this on the Jeremy Kyle Show?

03:51.360 --> 03:52.399
No, it was in Argos.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.639
Argos?

03:54.640 --> 03:58.639
You should have got one of them
little pens andjabbed it in her eye.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.919
What about you, weird kid?

04:03.920 --> 04:07.679
Don't take this the wrong way
but you look like a panty sniffer.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.679
I'm not a panty sniffer.

04:10.680 --> 04:14.319
I'm not a pervert.

04:19.640 --> 04:23.639
Itried to burn someone's house down.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.479
What did you do?

04:30.480 --> 04:34.479
Me? I was done for
eating some pick 'n' mix.

04:34.560 --> 04:35.839
Bollocks.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.799
What is going on with this weather?

04:38.800 --> 04:40.559
How did that happen?

04:40.560 --> 04:43.759
I mean, you've been here five minutes.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.079
It's painting benches.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.839
How did you screw that up?

04:47.840 --> 04:51.839
You tell me, because I've got no idea.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.039
What the hell was that? Oh, Jesus!

04:55.040 --> 04:58.479
What's going on?

04:58.480 --> 05:02.039
That's my car!

05:02.040 --> 05:03.079
Classic.

05:04.880 --> 05:05.799
Oh, my God!

05:05.800 --> 05:07.879
OK, so I'm a little bit freaked out.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.879
What is that?

05:16.120 --> 05:18.959
Right, everyone inside. Move! Move.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.919
Run!

05:41.240 --> 05:45.239
Keep going.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.999
It's locked. Open it.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.359
Come on!

06:00.360 --> 06:03.039
What is happening?

06:03.040 --> 06:04.959
Open the door!

06:04.960 --> 06:08.199
I'm finding the right key.
Come on! Open the door.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.319
Open the fucking door!

06:10.320 --> 06:14.319
Don't speak to me like that!

06:55.840 --> 06:58.479
I feel really weird.

06:58.480 --> 07:01.639
That'll be the lightning.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.079
We should be dead.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.999
A little reassurance
might be nice, you know.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.799
"You're fine. Looking good."

07:08.800 --> 07:10.679
Wanker!

07:10.680 --> 07:14.039
Did he just call me a wanker?

07:14.040 --> 07:17.559
Hey, hello?

07:17.560 --> 07:19.039
Is everyone all right?

07:19.040 --> 07:20.839
We could have died, you dick.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.839
Are you all right? You're
acting like a freak.

07:28.280 --> 07:32.279
Maybe we should call it a day.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.999
'That's right. Scrape it back.'

07:42.160 --> 07:44.759
What did you say?

07:44.760 --> 07:48.759
I didn't say anything.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.439
'She's such a chav.'

07:56.440 --> 07:57.879
What?

07:57.880 --> 08:01.879
What?!

08:06.800 --> 08:09.639
Do we just go then? Where's
the probation worker?

08:09.640 --> 08:11.879
I think there's
something wrong with him.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.439
It's like he was having a spasm.

08:13.440 --> 08:17.439
It's like he was having a spasm. He was probably
just faking it, to get compensation. Cheap bastard.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.599
I don't think so.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.319
And you'd know all about being mental.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.519
"Wanker!"

08:26.520 --> 08:28.879
Are we waiting for something?

08:28.880 --> 08:30.399
Probation worker.

08:30.400 --> 08:34.399
I'm not hanging around
for that dickhead.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.439
Shit.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.759
What you did to my phone?!

09:34.760 --> 09:38.759
Man, I'm telling you I'm coming
out there, I'm gonna mash you up.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.639
Good boy. Who's a little baby?

09:51.640 --> 09:54.159
You're my little man, are you?

09:54.160 --> 09:58.159
Cutie, cutie, my little cutie.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.359
You dirty bitch. I've
been licking my bollocks.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.559
Who are you fucking winking at?

10:12.560 --> 10:16.559
I'm going to shag that poodle
next door, she's proper dirty.

10:31.480 --> 10:35.399
Mum, it's me. My key won't work.

10:35.400 --> 10:39.159
Are you going to let me in?

10:41.920 --> 10:45.399
I need to give my relationship
with Jeremy a chance.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.639
Jeremy?! Come on.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.799
The guy's a total dildo.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.599
You are always making fun of people.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.799
Nothing anyone says hurts you.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.479
Not everybody's like that.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.959
Has Jezza been crying again?

11:00.960 --> 11:02.399
Come on, open the door.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.039
I've changed the locks.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.119
What?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.959
You can't be serious.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.679
If you stay, he'll leave.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.519
Where am I going to
live? Mum, open the door.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.799
Your things by the garage.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.319
I've put some money in your rucksack.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.079
I'll call you in a few days.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.039
Mum?

11:21.040 --> 11:23.919
Mum, don't, come on.

11:23.920 --> 11:27.919
Mum! Mum!

11:30.080 --> 11:34.079
Mum!

11:43.880 --> 11:47.879
Hey, Adam, how's
tricks, how's the herpes?

11:47.880 --> 11:51.279
All right, calm down, it's a joke.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.519
Billy. I need a favour,
mate. Can I stay and yours?

11:54.520 --> 11:56.599
Come on, it'll be a laugh.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.479
Liz, you don't mean that.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.519
You, you don't.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.279
Well, I don't believe you.

12:03.280 --> 12:07.279
Holly. Holly Boyd. The Paul meister!

12:11.400 --> 12:13.519
Yep.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.519
No, it's OK, I'll find somewhere else.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.679
No, no, I'm good, I'm good.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.999
It's dead weird.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.639
It's like I'm off my face or something.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.759
Keith was talking to
me, and he's a dog, yeah?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.559
It's doing my head in.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.839
'Get at it.'

12:46.840 --> 12:49.279
I'm telling you, I'm losing it.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.959
All right.

12:50.960 --> 12:54.319
'Why don't she want to have sex with me?

12:54.320 --> 12:57.759
'Come on, sex her up.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.319
'Oh, yeah!

12:59.320 --> 13:02.439
'What if she thinks I'm shit in bed?

13:02.440 --> 13:05.679
'She's been with loads
more people than I have.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.919
'Maybe she's screwing around.'

13:08.920 --> 13:10.599
Argh! What are you doing?

13:10.600 --> 13:11.759
I'm not a slag.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.759
What? What are you talking about?

13:13.760 --> 13:15.159
You think I screw around?

13:15.160 --> 13:16.279
Man, you've lost it.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.199
That's what you think, you
think I'd do that to you?

13:18.200 --> 13:22.119
Man, you're a mental case. We're
over. I've had enough of you.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.279
I fucking love you.

13:23.280 --> 13:27.279
'I can't believe I gave her that ring.'

14:42.200 --> 14:44.919
Mum? It's me.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.919
So, I just want you to know
that there's no hard feelings.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.519
I forgive you. You made your point.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.359
Point made.

14:55.360 --> 14:59.359
So let's stop all this nonsense, OK?

14:59.680 --> 15:01.239
So...

15:01.240 --> 15:05.239
I'll come round, and we'll hug, and
you'll cry, and I'll move back in.

15:06.760 --> 15:10.079
Sorted.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.039
Everybody's a winner.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.559
Anyway, so, call me, yeah?

15:16.560 --> 15:18.879
I'll be expecting your call.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.399
OK.

15:20.400 --> 15:24.359
# Let him stay in bed Till he's fed up

15:24.360 --> 15:28.359
# You know he can't go on

15:31.000 --> 15:34.999
# His life has felt so long

15:38.440 --> 15:41.279
# All ready to go

15:41.280 --> 15:45.279
# You know he's so lonely... #

15:59.720 --> 16:01.559
This is a joke. Did one of you do this?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.399
Don't look at me, I didn't do it.

16:03.400 --> 16:07.119
I'll tell you who did it,
it's that Banksy prick.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.799
There's a hidden meaning.

16:08.800 --> 16:12.639
It's like that monkey policeman
with the banana and the Tesco's bag.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.479
Maybe someone wants to kill us.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.239
Why would anybody want to kill us?

16:16.240 --> 16:18.039
Right, come on you
lot, let's get changed.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.599
Right, come on you lot, let's get changed.
Have you seen this? Someone's taking the piss.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.759
Yeah, it's terrible isn't it?
All this anti-social behaviour.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.479
Oh, is he having a dig at us?

16:26.640 --> 16:29.319
Right, that's it! All of
you, just give me your phones.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.599
No one's making any more
calls today. Now, come on.

16:31.600 --> 16:35.599
No one's making any more calls today. Now,
come on. Are you allowed to take our phones?

16:40.240 --> 16:44.239
What?

16:45.880 --> 16:48.279
I'm expecting a call from my mum.

16:48.280 --> 16:52.279
OK, take a message.

16:55.720 --> 16:59.719
Wanker.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.919
Is he allowed to take our phones?

17:08.920 --> 17:11.759
He's probably using them to
call one of those sex lines.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.719
Those sex lines will eat your credit.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.759
Call them a lot, do you?

17:15.760 --> 17:18.878
He's out there feeling
himself on our phones, naked.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.239
Masturbating.

17:20.240 --> 17:24.239
Isn't this Gary's cap?

17:25.040 --> 17:29.039
There's blood on it.

17:30.520 --> 17:34.519
Has anyone seen him?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.279
Did you see that?

17:47.280 --> 17:50.839
What was that?

17:50.840 --> 17:52.879
I'm talking to you.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.879
Something's happening to me.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.759
I'm right here!

18:00.760 --> 18:04.759
Look at me! Look at me!

18:30.440 --> 18:34.439
Can't you see me?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.039
Do you want some of this?

18:36.040 --> 18:37.919
Do you want some of this? No, I'm good.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.719
Give it here. Come on.

18:39.720 --> 18:43.719
For fuck's sake.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.559
Yeah, you just relax,
innit? Take it easy.

19:57.560 --> 20:01.559
Someone's just going to write
something else on there tonight.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.439
They make us do these bullshit
little jobs wearing these

20:04.440 --> 20:06.479
bullshit orange jumpsuits.

20:06.480 --> 20:10.119
They can suck my dick.

20:10.120 --> 20:14.119
Nice.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.399
Feel free to check out my tits, yeah.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.479
'She can't throw me out, she's my mum.

20:24.480 --> 20:28.479
'I'm homeless. That is so embarrassing.'

20:28.480 --> 20:32.319
You know after the storm, did
any of yous feel like dead weird?

20:32.320 --> 20:36.319
Yeah. I had a strange
tingling sensation in my anus.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.479
'I should say something.

20:41.480 --> 20:45.119
'I'm just so like a freak.'

20:45.120 --> 20:46.399
What, did you feel weird?

20:46.400 --> 20:48.319
You don't want to hear about my anus?

20:48.320 --> 20:50.359
Do you really need to ask the question?

20:50.360 --> 20:52.839
Something happened.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.199
What's that? Squeak up.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.479
Something happened to me.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.479
Are you a virgin? Hi ho!

20:59.480 --> 21:03.479
Shut up! What was it?

21:06.880 --> 21:10.879
It's nothing.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.039
'Would I? I think I would.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.439
'Oh, my God, I'm thinking
about shagging a chav.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.439
'Get a grip!'

21:20.800 --> 21:24.799
What was that for?

21:28.920 --> 21:32.039
Jesus.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.159
Kelly. Where do you think you're going?

21:34.160 --> 21:35.279
Oh, shut up.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.439
You can't just walk off
whenever you feel like it.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.319
Get your hands off me, you prick.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.199
You just keep pushing, don't you?

21:41.200 --> 21:45.199
Push, push, push. I'm sick
of dealing with scum like you.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.919
I'll report you!

21:46.920 --> 21:50.919
And who's going to believe you,
eh? You're nothing! Little bitch.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.159
Jesus!

22:29.000 --> 22:31.719
It's a shame more women don't
commit crime. Why is that?

22:31.720 --> 22:33.719
The way I see it,
we're a girl short, man.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.879
How's that?

22:34.880 --> 22:36.999
There's three of us
and only two of them.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.199
It looks like one of
us is going without.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.399
And I'm not being funny, but I'm
guessing you drew the short straw.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.479
Bad luck.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.479
Therewasfour of us.

22:46.480 --> 22:50.479
I'm talking about getting laid. So
how are we going to do this, man?

22:50.840 --> 22:51.879
Do what?

22:51.880 --> 22:54.999
Divide them up. Because the
one with all the frizzy hair,

22:55.000 --> 22:56.959
I don't see me and her getting it on.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.199
Because she's beautiful?

22:59.200 --> 23:01.479
No, because she'd be
way too much effort.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.039
She looks high-maintenance!

23:03.040 --> 23:04.959
You'd have to treat
her really well. Pff!

23:04.960 --> 23:07.159
But that other one.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.679
Kelly.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.319
Whatever. A couple of
Bacardi Breezers, man,

23:12.320 --> 23:13.959
I reckon she'd be good to go.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.319
I might need more than a couple
myself, but who's counting.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.759
Yeah, and the girls like,
do they have a say in this?

23:20.760 --> 23:23.759
A group of young people
doing mindless shit all day.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.519
Face it, man, it's going
to happen. It's biology.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.159
Or physics. One of those.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.359
So do we have a deal?

23:34.560 --> 23:37.199
No.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.679
Fine, maybe I'll take both.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.239
Yeah, I see that happening

23:40.240 --> 23:42.519
Yeah, you will see it
and then you'll be sorry

23:42.520 --> 23:46.519
you didn't accept the deal.
And then who's laughing? Me.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.439
What did he get done for?

23:56.440 --> 24:00.439
What did he get done for? He said he
was done for eating some Pic N' Mix.

24:01.640 --> 24:05.639
Prick.

24:18.960 --> 24:22.319
When I was in sixth form,
you came to my school.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.959
You gave this big talk about athletics

24:24.960 --> 24:26.879
and all your medals and that.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.119
So, I'm guessing you're
not going to the Olympics.

24:29.120 --> 24:33.119
So, I'm guessing you're not
going to the Olympics. Funny.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.759
I heard he was dealing crack.

24:44.760 --> 24:47.039
What? I wasn't dealing crack.

24:47.040 --> 24:49.119
No, no, no, the papers
said it was steroids.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.959
That stuff will shrivel your dick.

24:50.960 --> 24:54.159
It wasn't steroids. I'm not a cheat.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.199
That stuff in the papers was bullshit.

24:56.200 --> 25:00.199
So what was it then?

25:01.360 --> 25:04.799
I got caught with a little
bit of coke. All right?

25:04.800 --> 25:07.359
I messed up one time.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.279
No one gets community
service for possession.

25:09.280 --> 25:12.039
No one gets community service for possession.
If it was anyone else, they'd have got a caution.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.079
I get 200 hours' community service

25:14.080 --> 25:16.199
and a two-year ban from athletics.

25:16.200 --> 25:20.199
They said cos of my profile
they needed to send a message.

25:20.680 --> 25:24.399
You let yourself down.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.199
You let the kids down.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.399
You let your parents down.

25:27.400 --> 25:27.839
You let your parents
down. Shut the fuck up!

25:27.840 --> 25:29.239
You let your parents down. Shut the
fuck up! You let the people down.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.319
All I ever did was
train. You know nothing!

25:32.320 --> 25:33.439
I shouldn't even fucking be here.

25:33.440 --> 25:37.439
I shouldn't even fucking be here.
You can't hit someone in a wheelchair.

25:39.840 --> 25:43.839
Oof.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.439
Do want to know what I got done for?

25:50.440 --> 25:54.439
Not really.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.039
Fucking lesbo scum. >

26:06.680 --> 26:09.959
Me and my mate, Chloe, were
having cocktails in this bar, yeah.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.919
And she's hassling me, cos
she wants to go to this party.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.919
Chloe is on one, because she
thinks Jack is doing Lucy.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.039
A total slut fuck.

26:19.040 --> 26:23.039
So we get in my car. I
drive us to the party.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.479
We go into one of the rooms, yeah.

26:26.480 --> 26:30.479
Jack's not doing Lucy, he's doing Ellie.

26:30.480 --> 26:34.479
She is a proper slut. Chloe freaks.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.039
I'm driving us back into town.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.119
Chloe's all like, "Oh I feel sick."

26:40.120 --> 26:41.639
I'm like,

26:41.640 --> 26:45.639
"Don't puke in my car,
donotpuke in my car."

26:45.840 --> 26:47.719
That's when the police pull us over.

26:47.720 --> 26:51.359
I'm already banned from
driving, so I am like, "Fuck."

26:51.360 --> 26:54.519
This cop, yeah,

26:54.520 --> 26:58.039
he hands me the
breathalyser. And I'm like...

26:58.040 --> 27:02.039
"Do I suck, or blow?"

27:10.880 --> 27:14.879
It's insane, I'm totally working it.

27:37.680 --> 27:40.839
Now, I don't know if this cop

27:40.840 --> 27:44.839
is gay or what, but he tells me
I'm four times over the limit.

27:45.920 --> 27:49.919
It's bullshit. I didn't
even want to go to the party.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.399
He's going to kill us. Shit.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.479
Nice entrance. Very dramatic.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.879
The probation worker
has just attacked me.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.799
Something really weird is happening.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.799
I'm hearing these voices. It's like
I can hear what people are thinking.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.639
I'm hearing these voices. It's like I can hear what
people are thinking. Have you been sniffing glue?

28:04.640 --> 28:07.439
The storm, the lightning,
it's done something to us.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.999
OK. If you can hear our
thoughts, what am I thinking?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.959
'This is bullshit.'

28:11.960 --> 28:13.639
Do you think it's bullshit?

28:13.640 --> 28:15.279
Of course I think it's bullshit,

28:15.280 --> 28:17.639
you don't need to be a
mind reader to know that.

28:17.640 --> 28:18.879
Why are you in a wheelchair?

28:18.880 --> 28:20.039
Why are you in a
wheelchair? It was the storm.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.719
The strange tingling
sensation in my anus

28:22.720 --> 28:26.119
has spread through my body
and now I can't feel my legs.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.319
I'm serious.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.959
Ouch. Jesus.

28:28.960 --> 28:31.079
What do you mean the
probation worker attacked you?

28:31.080 --> 28:32.959
What do you mean the probation worker attacked
you? This does sound like complete shit.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.919
He is out there and he chased me.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.839
He is out there and he chased me.
Something's happened to me too.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.079
Did you pop your cherry?

28:39.080 --> 28:41.279
Ah, we are all very happy for you.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.279
Earlier on when we
were in the locker-room,

28:44.280 --> 28:46.599
I was invisible.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.239
I turned invisible.

28:48.240 --> 28:52.239
So, she's psychic and you can turn
invisible. That seems likely, yeah.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.999
Did anyone witness this
miraculous disappearance?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.079
You were all there.

28:57.080 --> 29:00.239
I think we might have noticed
you vanishing into thin air.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.639
You didn't.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.799
I was standing right
there. You couldn't see me.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.799
All right.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.559
Go on, then. Do it.

29:12.560 --> 29:16.559
Turn invisible.

29:20.520 --> 29:24.519
Oh, my God, he's disappeared!

29:27.720 --> 29:28.719
Can't you see me?

29:28.720 --> 29:30.519
Can't you see me? No.

29:30.520 --> 29:34.119
You're invisible!?
You two are hilarious.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.159
Really, keep taking that medication.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.319
Don't go out there, he will kill you.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.239
Of course he will because
he's such a bad ass.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.399
Of course he will because
he's such a bad ass. Don't!

29:41.400 --> 29:44.719
'I would. I would definitely shag her.'

29:44.720 --> 29:47.839
Come on, this is the biggest
load of bullshit I've ever heard.

29:47.840 --> 29:48.519
No!

29:48.520 --> 29:49.559
No! Ah!

29:49.560 --> 29:53.559
Argh!

30:32.080 --> 30:33.119
Can't you see me? >

30:33.120 --> 30:37.119
No. >

30:37.720 --> 30:39.359
You're invisible?!

30:39.360 --> 30:43.359
You two are hilarious. Really,
keep taking that medication.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.479
Don't! Don't go out
there, he will kill you.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.279
Of course he will because
he's such a bad ass.

30:47.280 --> 30:47.999
Of course he will because
he's such a bad ass. Don't!

30:48.000 --> 30:51.999
Of course he will because he's such a
bad ass. Don't! She's telling the truth.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.759
And you know this how? I
suppose you're a psychic now too.

30:55.760 --> 30:59.599
All this. It's already happened once.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.679
I open the door, the probation
worker, he killed you.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.359
You were right there.

31:04.360 --> 31:07.239
You were dead. Everything froze.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.279
You were all just standing
there. Time went backwards.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.959
What are you saying?
What, you turned back time?

31:12.960 --> 31:14.719
It just gets better by the second.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.199
It just gets better by the second.
Everything happened again. Exactly the same.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.679
I'm telling you, don't open that door.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.079
No!

31:22.080 --> 31:23.799
He's right.

31:23.800 --> 31:27.685
The probation worker's gone mental.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.519
Maybe he's on crystal meth.
That stuff makes you crazy.

31:30.520 --> 31:33.239
My friend Chloe did it, she
nearly shagged her brother.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.919
And he's really ugly.

31:35.920 --> 31:39.079
The graffiti. I'm going
to kill you. He wrote it.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.679
What did I say
- I said there was a hidden meaning.

31:41.680 --> 31:43.679
Or not.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.999
Did anything happen to you?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.279
No. We should call the police.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.599
He took our phones,
he's got all our phones.

31:50.600 --> 31:54.599
He's stopped.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.919
You dickhead, why did you come back
here? You should have gone for help!

31:58.920 --> 32:00.199
What do you know, bitch!

32:00.200 --> 32:01.159
What do you know,
bitch! Shut up, you chav.

32:01.160 --> 32:05.159
If you call me a chav one more time, I'll kick
you so hard in the cunt your mum will feel it.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.599
Her mum will feel it
- how does that work?

32:07.600 --> 32:09.159
Her mum will feel it
- how does that work? He tried to kill me!

32:09.160 --> 32:11.759
I came back here towards you
lot and I could have left ya.

32:11.760 --> 32:15.759
I'm sick of every single one of you
judging me. You can all fuck off!

32:16.000 --> 32:17.159
Whatever. I'm getting out of here.

32:17.160 --> 32:18.959
Whatever. I'm getting out of
here. Out the back way, come on.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.959
Fuck's sake!

32:24.600 --> 32:26.199
Is that blood?

32:26.200 --> 32:30.199
Fuck! Jesus Christ!

32:31.560 --> 32:33.319
Get it off me.

32:33.320 --> 32:37.319
Jesus!

32:57.920 --> 33:01.919
I did wonder what had happened to him.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.319
He's going to kill us.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.079
Turn back time, stop this happening.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.319
I don't know how it works.

33:11.320 --> 33:15.319
That's great, that's really useful!

33:15.880 --> 33:17.879
Come on.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.759
Don't look at him.

33:20.760 --> 33:24.439
I've got to have sex with you right now.

33:24.440 --> 33:25.999
You're so beautiful.

33:26.000 --> 33:26.919
What's up with him?

33:26.920 --> 33:28.879
Let's go, let's do it now.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.639
Let's go, let's do it
now. Get off me, you freak!

33:30.640 --> 33:33.759
What?

33:33.760 --> 33:37.759
You're so hot! I'm gonna bone
you, I'm gonna shag you senseless!

33:41.680 --> 33:43.239
What did I do?

33:43.240 --> 33:44.639
You said you were going to shag her.

33:44.640 --> 33:45.519
You said you were going to shag
her. You were getting your chap out.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.879
You said you were going to shag her.
You were getting your chap out. Shut up!

33:46.880 --> 33:50.879
It's when you were touching her.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.839
I'm so hard for you.

34:02.840 --> 34:06.239
I want to rip your clothes
off and piss on your tits.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.799
What is happening to me?

34:07.800 --> 34:11.799
You sick bastard!

34:25.639 --> 34:29.639
What did you do?

34:34.920 --> 34:37.639
Is he dead?

34:37.639 --> 34:39.518
I'm no doctor but...

34:39.520 --> 34:42.319
you see the way the back of
his head's caved in like that...

34:45.400 --> 34:49.399
I'm not a chav!

34:57.480 --> 35:01.479
That should do it.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.639
You killed our operation worker.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.279
This is very, very bad.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.199
I feel sick.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.639
He would have killed us.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.639
We should call the police.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.359
It was self-defence.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.399
Yeah. He's right. We
show him the dead boy

35:18.400 --> 35:21.279
in the locker, they'll do some
CSI shit and figure it out.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.719
They won't believe us.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.359
We just tell them the
truth. We stick to our story.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.279
What's our story?
They can turn invisible

35:27.280 --> 35:28.959
and that you can turn back time?

35:28.960 --> 35:32.639
It doesn't matter what we tell
them, they'll say we're lying.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.199
They'll say we killed them both.

35:34.200 --> 35:37.959
No one's gonna believe
you, not any more.

35:37.960 --> 35:41.959
If there's no body, there's no crime.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.399
We should bury them under the flyover.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.999
Yeah?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.119
How do we do that?
Someone's gonna see us.

35:49.120 --> 35:53.119
No, we give them a quick little...

35:53.120 --> 35:55.439
Put them in those wheelchairs,
wheel them up there,

35:55.440 --> 35:58.519
and if anyone sees us, we're
just a bunch of young offenders

35:58.520 --> 36:02.519
taking a couple of specials
for a walk in the sunshine.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.279
I'm pretty sure this
breaches the terms of my ASBO.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.279
We don't tell anyone about this, yeah?

36:34.280 --> 36:37.279
About the storm or what
it did to us or anything.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.479
We are about to bury
our probation worker,

36:39.480 --> 36:41.079
we don't need to be drawing
any attention to ourselves.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.719
I don't want anyone to know.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.279
I cannot be a freak.

36:45.280 --> 36:49.279
What about you?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.799
There's no going back now, man.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.919
You were just as screwed
as the rest of us.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.999
You are black AND famous.
You are probably more screwed.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.999
I shouldn't even be here.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.919
Just then, when he was touching yer...

37:08.920 --> 37:10.199
How were you doing that?

37:10.200 --> 37:14.199
I don't know.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.399
Didn't you say you wanted
to piss on her tits?

37:21.400 --> 37:24.039
Probably best to keep that kind of thing

37:24.040 --> 37:28.039
between you and your
internet service provider.

37:30.560 --> 37:34.559
Are you all right?

37:41.200 --> 37:43.399
'If she can hear what I'm thinking,

37:43.400 --> 37:45.239
'does she know I want to shag her?

37:45.240 --> 37:49.239
'Shit, she can hear that!'

37:49.240 --> 37:53.239
Hold on, all of you have
some kind of special power.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.159
Everyone can do something except me.

37:56.160 --> 37:59.919
He can do something, he can
do something and I can't.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.959
That's ridiculous, look at him!

38:01.960 --> 38:03.759
How does that make any sense?

38:03.760 --> 38:07.759
Maybe you can do something, you just
haven't found out what it is yet.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.239
Yeah, right.

38:11.240 --> 38:14.039
What if I can't feel pain? Ow!

38:14.040 --> 38:15.119
Did you feel that?

38:15.120 --> 38:19.119
Stop hitting me!

38:30.120 --> 38:34.119
# God knows your lonely souls

38:35.600 --> 38:39.599
# God knows your lonely souls

38:51.360 --> 38:55.359
# God knows your lonely souls

39:00.280 --> 39:04.279
# I believe there's a time and a place

39:06.280 --> 39:10.279
# To let your mind drift
and get out of this place

39:11.600 --> 39:15.599
# I believe there's a day and a place

39:16.920 --> 39:20.919
# That we will go to and
I know you want to share

39:22.160 --> 39:26.159
# There's no secret to living

39:27.160 --> 39:31.159
# Just keep on walking

39:32.400 --> 39:36.399
# There's no secret to dying

39:38.200 --> 39:42.199
# Just keep on flying

39:43.000 --> 39:46.999
# I'm gonna die in a place
that don't know my name

39:53.920 --> 39:57.039
# I'm gonna die in a space

39:57.040 --> 40:01.039
# That don't hold my name... #

40:24.560 --> 40:27.519
If anyone asks what happened yesterday

40:27.520 --> 40:31.519
we say nothing, right?

40:31.880 --> 40:35.879
It's just a completely normal day.

40:41.240 --> 40:43.199
There's nothing here.

40:43.200 --> 40:47.079
No note, nothing, it's
like he's just disappeared.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.879
Some of them are here already.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.879
Yeah.

40:51.880 --> 40:55.879
I'll talk to them.

40:56.320 --> 41:00.319
Gary and my colleague, Tony,
have both been reported missing.

41:02.440 --> 41:06.439
Their families are
very worried about them.

41:06.640 --> 41:10.639
Have you seen anything
unusual, anything at all?

41:17.160 --> 41:19.959
You saw something?

41:19.960 --> 41:22.879
A few days ago...

41:22.880 --> 41:26.839
I go into the toilets,
Tony and Gary were in there.

41:26.840 --> 41:30.399
They are butt naked,
Tony has very by his hair,

41:30.400 --> 41:34.239
like this, and he's just
doing him, doggy style.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.159
And Tony is like,

41:36.160 --> 41:40.159
who's your daddy? I'm
your daddy, I'm Big Daddy.

41:41.560 --> 41:45.239
You like that.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.319
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

41:47.320 --> 41:51.319
I'm Daddy Cool!

41:53.040 --> 41:56.919
So I'm guessing they've ran away to
continue their illicit homosexual affair.

41:56.920 --> 42:00.919
I ask you, in this world of
intolerance and prejudice,

42:01.640 --> 42:05.639
who are we to condemn them?

42:25.840 --> 42:28.999
Hi, this is Tony, leave me a
message and I'll get back to you

42:29.000 --> 42:30.319
as soon as I can.

42:30.320 --> 42:34.319
Bye.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.279
I think we got away with it.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.639
Do you actually believe that
or are you just really dumb?

43:00.640 --> 43:04.639
I actually believe that.

43:05.120 --> 43:08.119
I was there. I should have
one of these bullshit powers.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.839
You can have mine. You want to hear
what people are thinking about you?

43:10.840 --> 43:14.839
Not so much. I want something
good, something from the A-list.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.759
Maybe you can fly.

43:19.760 --> 43:22.799
He's not going to be able to fly.

43:22.800 --> 43:25.839
Yeah, there's always someone
that can fly. Check it out.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.839
Don't.

43:31.040 --> 43:35.039
Ow! No, that's not it.

43:35.480 --> 43:39.479
So what happens now? Is this it?
Are we gonna be like this forever?

43:41.720 --> 43:44.879
What if we are meant to
be, like, superheroes?

43:44.880 --> 43:48.399
You lot, superheroes?

43:48.400 --> 43:50.759
No offence, but in what
kind of fucked-up world

43:50.760 --> 43:52.199
would that be allowed to happen?

43:52.200 --> 43:53.679
I did not sign up for that.

43:53.680 --> 43:56.319
Superheroes! I love this guy
- you prick!

43:56.320 --> 43:59.759
What if there's loads of
people like us all over town?

43:59.760 --> 44:03.639
No, that kind of thing
only happens in America.

44:03.640 --> 44:07.119
This will fade away. I'm telling
you, by this time next week,

44:07.120 --> 44:11.119
it'll be back to the
same old boring shit.

44:17.080 --> 44:18.679
You!

44:18.680 --> 44:20.039
You want to tell us who that was?

44:20.040 --> 44:23.439
There is something weird
going on with Jeremy.

44:23.440 --> 44:24.679
Can you get me a gun?

44:24.680 --> 44:28.679
There's no way I'm getting
a dickhead like you a gun.

44:32.280 --> 44:34.439
My mum told me to stay
away from girls like you.

44:34.440 --> 44:37.519
Your mum has never met a girl like me.

44:37.520 --> 44:39.919
Let's do it on the desk.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.159
Get off me!

44:41.160 --> 44:45.159
Let's get that wind flowing
through your scalp, come on.

44:48.560 --> 44:52.559
Someone knows. They know we
killed our probation worker.
