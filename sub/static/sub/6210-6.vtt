This would be a good time

00:52.952 --> 00:54.219

That was quick.

01:02.060 --> 01:06.030
So you're all alone
without Mommy or Daddy?

01:06.031 --> 01:08.099
Well, there's been a jailbreak.

01:08.100 --> 01:11.536

01:54.846 --> 01:56.614
Oh. Thanks.
I needed that.

01:56.615 --> 01:58.283
Oh, no. We've been invited

to Aunt Beulah's
Halloween party <i>again.</i>

02:00.552 --> 02:01.986
Aunt Beulah?
I've never met her.

02:01.987 --> 02:03.688
Does she know the family secret?

02:03.689 --> 02:05.423
Her only secret
is that she's managed to throw

02:05.424 --> 02:06.958
the dullest Halloween party

02:06.959 --> 02:08.626
for the last 500 years in a row.

02:08.627 --> 02:09.727
So why do you guys go?

02:09.728 --> 02:11.229
It's not like your social life--

02:12.297 --> 02:14.031
Oh.

02:14.032 --> 02:16.067
We've never gone.

02:16.068 --> 02:18.569
Come to think of it,
we've never even met her.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.805
And we're running out
of excuses.

02:20.806 --> 02:22.206
World wars I and II,

02:22.207 --> 02:23.508

Luke and Laura's wedding.

02:25.678 --> 02:28.012
Oh, dear, we have to go.

02:28.013 --> 02:29.380
Oh, thank goodness.

02:29.381 --> 02:31.349
I was afraid I was gonna
have fun this Halloween.

02:31.350 --> 02:32.784
There.

02:32.785 --> 02:34.085
We've R.S.V.P.'d.

02:41.127 --> 02:43.394
"Spellman family confirmed

02:43.395 --> 02:44.829
Is it possible
to put someone up

02:44.830 --> 02:46.164
for adoption
just for one night?

02:46.165 --> 02:47.632
Yeah, put me up.

02:47.633 --> 02:50.067
VALERIE:
I've got the best idea
for Halloween.

02:50.068 --> 02:52.103
Harvey, Justin, you
and me at your house

02:52.104 --> 02:53.404
watching scary movies.

02:53.405 --> 02:55.306
Please tell me you haven't
already invited them.

02:55.307 --> 02:56.941
No, I learned my lesson
from last year.

02:56.942 --> 02:58.543
I'm telling you
before I invite people

02:58.544 --> 03:00.010
to your house
without telling you.

03:00.011 --> 03:01.879
Good. 'Cause I'd really like
to have you guys over,

03:01.880 --> 03:03.481
but I've already
promised my aunts--

03:03.482 --> 03:04.549
Harvey!

03:04.550 --> 03:05.951
VALERIE: And Justin.
Sabrina.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.051
And Valerie.

03:07.052 --> 03:08.653
Let's not break into song, okay?

03:08.654 --> 03:10.054
What are we doing for Halloween?

03:10.055 --> 03:11.789
Watching scary movies
at Sabrina's house.

03:11.790 --> 03:14.459
Cool. We'll get the movies,
you get the hoagies.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.529
Valerie, you invited people
to my house again.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.297
Sorry.
It's so ironic.

03:19.298 --> 03:21.499
It's the one area of my life
I'm really pushy.

03:23.002 --> 03:25.270
Please, please, please.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.572
Don't make me go to
Aunt Beulah's party.

03:27.573 --> 03:29.840
Come on.
It's our first double date.

03:30.208 --> 03:31.475
Come on.

03:31.476 --> 03:33.011
I-If you say yes,
I'll do all the cooking

03:33.012 --> 03:34.412
the cleaning, the laundry.

03:34.413 --> 03:36.214
You won't have to lift
your finger for weeks.

03:36.215 --> 03:39.050
Come on, look at this face.

03:39.051 --> 03:41.519
Oh, all right.
You don't have to go.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.554
Thanks. Are you still
gonna hold me to that

03:43.555 --> 03:44.955
cooking, cleaning,
laundry thing?

03:44.956 --> 03:46.123
( laughs )

03:46.124 --> 03:47.525
Boo.

03:47.526 --> 03:49.794
Salem,
you look ridiculous.

03:49.795 --> 03:52.129
You were terrified,
and you know it.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.265
( scoffs )

03:57.202 --> 03:59.003
MAN:
Special delivery
for Sabrina Spellman.

03:59.004 --> 04:00.105
Oh, that's me.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.373
Um, would you accept
an invisible tip?

04:02.374 --> 04:04.476
How about you kiss
my invisible behind?

04:06.011 --> 04:08.913
Sounds like someone
should go back to sorting.

04:10.449 --> 04:12.484
Why does Sabrina get
to stay home

04:12.485 --> 04:13.718
and I have to go?

04:13.719 --> 04:15.619
Hey, Aunt Beulah sent me
a Halloween present

04:15.620 --> 04:17.154
'cause I can't make it
to her party.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.322
She doesn't have to go
<i>and</i> she gets presents?

04:19.324 --> 04:21.459
It's a Molly Dolly?

04:21.459 --> 04:23.394
Whatever happened
to a crisp 20?

04:23.395 --> 04:26.431
Oh, well, dear,
she means well.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.866
Listen,
if you need to call us,

04:27.867 --> 04:28.933
we left the number.

04:28.934 --> 04:30.401
This will be fun.

04:30.402 --> 04:32.971
I haven't been a chaperone
since Altamont.

04:32.972 --> 04:35.506
I don't have to go. I just
remembered I have free will.

04:35.507 --> 04:36.941
No, you don't.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.281
Okay,
young lady,

04:43.282 --> 04:45.116
you listen,
and you listen good.

04:45.117 --> 04:47.184
There will be no smooching, no--

04:47.185 --> 04:48.219
( doorbell ringing )

04:48.220 --> 04:49.119
They're here.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.387
Play with my doll.

04:54.193 --> 04:55.326
Trick or treat.

04:55.327 --> 04:57.294
Hey, good call on
not wearing a costume.

04:57.295 --> 04:58.663
Where are the guys?

04:58.664 --> 04:59.630
( guys grunt )
( screams )

05:00.832 --> 05:02.166
Pretty scary, huh?

05:02.167 --> 05:04.102
On a lot of levels.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.271
Cool. A storm.

05:07.272 --> 05:09.841
Hope my little brother's okay.
He's going as the tin man.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.242
I bet it's gonna rain.

05:11.243 --> 05:13.111
Perfect night
to watch scary movies.

05:13.112 --> 05:14.078

Yeah.

05:19.418 --> 05:21.552
Sorry. We got to
the movie store kinda late

05:21.553 --> 05:23.621
and these were the only
scary movies we could find.

05:23.622 --> 05:25.156
Well, come on in.

05:25.157 --> 05:26.324
The hoagies are on.

05:26.325 --> 05:27.492
The root beer's chilled.

05:30.595 --> 05:32.663

05:32.664 --> 05:34.432
Very funny, Salem.

Five's a crowd, doll.

05:40.505 --> 05:41.939
( wolf howling in distance )

05:41.940 --> 05:43.374
Now, remember...

05:43.375 --> 05:45.176
When you want me
to shoot you and put you out

05:45.177 --> 05:46.878
of your misery,
you'll scratch your nose.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.146
Right.

05:51.116 --> 05:52.316
Now brace yourself
for an evening

of awkward conversation
and disturbing smells.

06:23.448 --> 06:26.317
Clint Eastwood
just took his shirt off.

06:26.318 --> 06:27.919
Nothing worse than cold popcorn.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.421
Uh, I'll, uh-- I'll be
right back with some more.

06:35.093 --> 06:36.594
You're just a doll.

06:36.595 --> 06:38.062
You didn't smile at me, right?

06:38.063 --> 06:40.264
I'm a Molly Dolly.

06:40.265 --> 06:42.733
Salem, please tell me
you're throwing your voice.

06:42.734 --> 06:44.601
Mm? Mm, not me.

Too many caramels.

Hilda, stop it.

06:52.010 --> 06:54.178
We're not leaving
until we find Aunt Beulah.

06:55.648 --> 06:56.848
Excuse me.

06:56.849 --> 06:57.849
Are you Aunt Beulah?

06:57.850 --> 06:59.684
Oh,no. I'm Delilah,

06:59.685 --> 07:01.919
and I'm delighted to meet you.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.020
They sound alike.

07:03.021 --> 07:05.957
It's a real
conversation starter.

07:09.761 --> 07:11.061
Okay, she's not
here. Let's go.

07:12.097 --> 07:13.865
Ladies, allow me
to introduce myself.

07:13.866 --> 07:16.233
I am Dr. Hans Egglehoffer.

07:16.234 --> 07:18.035
The Dr. Hans Egglehoffer?

07:18.036 --> 07:20.504
The renowned psychiatrist,
author and surgeon?

07:20.505 --> 07:22.573
Really? Where?

07:22.574 --> 07:24.175
Oh. Whoo! That's me.

07:24.176 --> 07:26.310
( laughs )

07:26.311 --> 07:28.412
This party isn't going
to be boring after all.

07:28.413 --> 07:30.515
Dr. Egglehoffer
is the foremost authority

07:30.516 --> 07:31.915
on slug reproduction.

07:31.916 --> 07:33.717
Ooh, ask him
if he's got a friend.

07:33.718 --> 07:35.253
Hi, simply hi.

07:35.254 --> 07:36.754
I'm Gary Owens.

07:36.755 --> 07:37.554
The TV personality?

07:37.555 --> 07:38.856
Oh, sure you are.

07:38.857 --> 07:41.058
Yes, and I also have
my own radio show

07:41.059 --> 07:43.494
heard nationwide
by 15 million listeners.

07:43.495 --> 07:45.429
Thank you.

07:45.430 --> 07:47.431
Doesn't even sound
like Gary Owens.

07:47.432 --> 07:52.069
Is this a fabulous party
or what?

07:52.070 --> 07:54.605
Well, obviously,
you've had a few...too many.

07:54.606 --> 07:57.041
So after our perfunctory hellos
and good-byes

07:57.042 --> 07:58.776
to old Aunt Beulah,

07:58.777 --> 07:59.944
we'll drive you home.

07:59.945 --> 08:01.645
But I am home.

08:01.646 --> 08:04.515
But that would
make you Aunt Beulah.

08:04.516 --> 08:05.883
That's...

08:05.884 --> 08:07.852
¶ Me-e-e-e-e ¶

08:07.853 --> 08:08.820
Aunt Beulah!

08:10.322 --> 08:11.322
Oh, darling.

08:11.323 --> 08:13.290
We're so happy
we finally made it.

08:13.291 --> 08:16.394
Well, that's a load
of bull honky, but I love it.

08:16.395 --> 08:17.361
( laughs )

08:17.362 --> 08:18.730
Listen up,
everybody.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.998
It's time for a toast.

08:20.999 --> 08:23.201
I have been up all night

08:23.202 --> 08:24.835
making this candy corn.

08:24.836 --> 08:26.170
Tell me what you think.

08:26.171 --> 08:27.272
Be brutal.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.474
Be brutal.

08:29.475 --> 08:30.808
It's kind of stale.

08:30.809 --> 08:32.210
Monster.

08:34.446 --> 08:35.813
Okay. Nobody's seen anything.

08:35.813 --> 08:37.047
The night is still salvageable.

08:37.048 --> 08:39.015
I'm a Molly Dolly.

08:39.017 --> 08:41.419
Look, I'm sure you're a nice
dolly, but I don't have time--

08:41.419 --> 08:42.854
Sabrina?
Valerie!

08:42.855 --> 08:45.056
Why are you talking to a doll?

08:45.057 --> 08:47.225
Because I don't
believe in hitting them.

08:47.226 --> 08:48.559
You have some trick-or-treaters,

08:48.560 --> 08:50.361
but none of us
can open the door.

08:50.362 --> 08:51.596
Trick-or-treaters?

08:51.597 --> 08:53.230
What could they possibly want?

08:59.938 --> 09:01.538
( sighs )

09:01.539 --> 09:03.341
Make sure she doesn't
get out of there.

09:03.342 --> 09:05.943
A little time in the box
might do her some good.

09:08.947 --> 09:11.548
Wow, Mulan has quite an arm.

09:11.549 --> 09:13.584
Hey, if you kids
don't knock it off,

09:13.585 --> 09:15.152
I'm gonna
break out the raisins!

09:19.324 --> 09:21.092
You okay?
Yeah.

09:21.093 --> 09:22.660
There must be
an electrical storm,

09:22.661 --> 09:25.663
and you know eggs
conduct lightning.

09:25.664 --> 09:26.864
I'll just go try
the back door.

09:26.865 --> 09:27.998
Here,
I'll help you.

09:27.999 --> 09:29.333
No! Look.

09:29.334 --> 09:31.535
Another bridge.

09:31.536 --> 09:34.305
Now I know why my mom
loves this movie.

09:36.041 --> 09:37.875
You know, you have
a fascinating brain.

09:37.876 --> 09:39.409
I would love to study it.

09:39.410 --> 09:40.678
Oh, you're too kind.

09:40.679 --> 09:42.780
Mind if I take
a few measurements?

09:42.781 --> 09:44.615
Don't you wanna try
the cocktail wieners?

09:44.616 --> 09:45.950
I hear they're good.

09:45.951 --> 09:47.385
"If you like cocktail wieners,

09:47.386 --> 09:49.119
"you'll love our new cheese log.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.155
"Made with 100 percent cheese

09:51.156 --> 09:52.857
and 50 percent log."

09:54.026 --> 09:55.026
I hope this party's over

09:55.027 --> 09:56.427
while I'm still in my 500's.

09:56.428 --> 09:57.528
( laughing )

10:01.734 --> 10:02.699
I don't get it.

10:03.201 --> 10:04.535
Excuse me.

10:06.771 --> 10:08.106
Okay, I can't take it anymore.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.307
I've had enough of this party

10:09.308 --> 10:10.508
and enough candy corn.

10:10.509 --> 10:11.575
I wanna go home.

10:11.576 --> 10:13.810
Don't you think I wanna leave?

10:13.811 --> 10:15.113
But we can't during the toast.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.246
It would just be rude.

10:16.247 --> 10:18.816
After all these centuries

10:18.817 --> 10:20.685
I'm celebrating Halloween

10:20.686 --> 10:22.286
with my dear nieces,

10:22.287 --> 10:24.889
Hilda and Zelda.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.323
Not now.
I don't give a bat's behind.

10:26.324 --> 10:27.892
I want to go home!

10:27.893 --> 10:29.259
( crowd gasps )

10:30.762 --> 10:34.332
Well. Uh...
we'll just be leaving now.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.834
Oh, that's impossible. Ha.

10:36.835 --> 10:39.036
Oh, Bellevuedere.

10:39.037 --> 10:41.439
This is an insane asylum.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.707
No one leaves...ever.

10:43.708 --> 10:44.975
( laughing )

10:44.976 --> 10:47.779
It didn't say that
on the invitation.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.213
( maniacal laughter )

10:50.549 --> 10:52.049
I'm a Molly Dolly.

10:52.050 --> 10:54.018
I know.

10:54.019 --> 10:55.019
Wait.

10:55.020 --> 10:56.420
You're behind all this.

10:56.421 --> 10:57.421
Why'd you seal all the doors?

10:57.422 --> 10:58.723
How'd you get out of the box?

10:58.724 --> 10:59.823
Where's Salem?

10:59.824 --> 11:00.791
( Salem crying, muffled )

11:04.295 --> 11:07.298
( gasping ):
The Molly Dolly is bad.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.833
Hide me behind the rye
and close the door.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.269
You sicken me.

11:12.437 --> 11:14.271
Look, Molly "Psycho" Dolly,
I don't know

11:14.272 --> 11:16.474
what you're up to, but
if you don't unlock this house,

11:16.475 --> 11:18.743
I'm gonna throw you out
in the middle of traffic.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.779
Well...as soon
as you unlock this house.

11:21.780 --> 11:24.014
I'm a Molly Dolly.

11:24.015 --> 11:25.716
Stop it! Can't you
say anything else?

11:25.717 --> 11:27.451
I'm a Molly Dolly,

11:27.452 --> 11:30.254
and I'm gonna get you.

11:30.255 --> 11:33.157
That's not
what I wanted to hear.

11:33.158 --> 11:35.059
( <i>spooky theme playing</i> )

11:39.798 --> 11:42.866
Look, Molly,
I'm not afraid of you.

11:42.867 --> 11:45.803
I don't know if you're aware
of this, but I'm a witch.

11:45.804 --> 11:47.705
Ooh, I'm scared.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.940
Sarcasm not sold separately.

11:49.941 --> 11:51.375
( giggling )

11:55.847 --> 11:57.248
SABRINA:
Look, I'm warning you.

11:57.249 --> 11:58.649
I have friends over.

11:58.650 --> 12:00.017
Oh, goody.

12:00.018 --> 12:02.620
I have friends too.

12:05.089 --> 12:06.524
Oh, um--

12:06.525 --> 12:08.759
Nice to meet you, Frank.
How'd the operation turn out?

12:08.760 --> 12:10.661
Got to go.
( growling )

12:12.731 --> 12:14.332
( growling )

12:15.801 --> 12:18.068
Hoagies repeating
on you too, huh?

12:20.505 --> 12:21.839
( violin playing )

12:21.840 --> 12:23.173
Do I hear a violin?

12:23.174 --> 12:24.508
I need the practice.

12:24.509 --> 12:25.842
Don't look! I'm self-conscious.

12:25.843 --> 12:26.910
( growling )

12:30.949 --> 12:32.983
Not the sharpest pencil
in the monster box.

12:32.984 --> 12:33.917
( chuckles )

12:36.020 --> 12:37.522
You can't just keep us here.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.256
We can just zap ourselves out.

12:42.327 --> 12:43.894
What have you done
with our magic?

12:43.895 --> 12:45.595
You no longer have your power.

12:45.596 --> 12:48.432
That's what
the candy corn was for.

12:48.433 --> 12:49.800
Oh, Bellevuedere!

12:49.801 --> 12:50.835
Oh.
Oh.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.236
You don't understand.

12:52.237 --> 12:54.805
We do not belong
in an insane asylum.

12:54.806 --> 12:56.173
We don't even
like Crazy Bread.

12:56.174 --> 12:58.176
Maybe we'll have
to subdue you.

12:58.177 --> 12:59.309
Won't hurt a bit.

12:59.310 --> 13:01.178
Not me, anyway. Ha.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.981
( in unison ):
Run!

13:03.982 --> 13:05.650
I'm glad I wore
my sensible shoes.

13:05.651 --> 13:07.184
They were on sale at Fayva.

13:07.185 --> 13:10.021
The prices were insane!

13:12.758 --> 13:13.891
Okay, it's late.

13:13.892 --> 13:15.392
Time to go. See you at school.

13:16.728 --> 13:19.329
I'm looking
at a still photo. Move!

13:19.330 --> 13:20.597
It's only 8:45.

13:20.598 --> 13:22.266
And the doors are stuck.

13:22.267 --> 13:23.934
I'm pretty sure
the mud porch is wide open.

13:23.935 --> 13:25.970
Not anymore.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.338
Don't go.

13:27.339 --> 13:28.405
The knife--
Heh-heh.

13:28.406 --> 13:31.608
I mean, the night
has just begun.

13:31.609 --> 13:34.245
And they say she's
the next Teddy Ruxpin. Ha!

13:34.246 --> 13:36.313
Who turned out the lights?

13:36.314 --> 13:38.082
( giggles )

13:38.083 --> 13:39.216
( all screaming )

13:39.217 --> 13:40.150
( giggles )

13:40.151 --> 13:41.318
Me!

13:41.319 --> 13:42.486
SABRINA:
That's it.

13:42.487 --> 13:43.754
I'm calling my aunts for help.

13:45.757 --> 13:47.090
The phone's dead.

13:47.091 --> 13:50.094
If you're a teenager
scared out of your wits,

13:50.095 --> 13:52.662
press the pound key now.

13:52.663 --> 13:54.564
Listen,
I shouldn't tell you this,

13:54.565 --> 13:56.400
but it may be our only chance
for survival.

13:56.401 --> 13:57.601
That doll has magical powers.

13:57.602 --> 13:58.569
It's out to get all of us.

13:58.570 --> 14:00.104
Run! Hide! Save yourselves!

14:00.105 --> 14:02.306
( laughs )

14:02.307 --> 14:04.542
Sabrina, when you do a prank,
you go all out.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.444
I heard about
your river of candy corn.

14:07.045 --> 14:08.812
It's not a prank!

14:08.813 --> 14:11.381
We're never gonna get
to see <i>Enchanted April!</i>

14:11.382 --> 14:13.884
( all laughing )

14:14.919 --> 14:16.153
( giggling )

14:20.325 --> 14:22.192
All right, I think
we've lost Bellevuedere.

14:22.193 --> 14:24.028
Luckily, we were running
and he was frolicking.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.997
Oh, great-- an exit.
We can escape.

14:26.998 --> 14:28.331
( babbling )

14:28.867 --> 14:30.301
Nope, just an escape

14:30.302 --> 14:31.535
from reality.

14:31.536 --> 14:33.270
Quick. Bellevuedere's coming.

14:33.271 --> 14:34.405
I know a way out.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.606
Oh, thank goodness,
Delilah.

14:35.607 --> 14:37.007
You're the only
sane person here.

14:37.008 --> 14:40.644
Delilah? My name's not Delilah.

14:40.645 --> 14:41.946
It's Fred.

14:41.947 --> 14:45.916
Don't make me turn this
car around.

14:45.917 --> 14:47.317
( making motor running noises )

14:50.121 --> 14:53.056
It's funny. I never thought
I'd die this way.

14:53.925 --> 14:55.393
Not really funny ha-ha.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.426
No.

14:56.427 --> 14:57.427
More funny ha-ha--

14:57.428 --> 14:59.563
( chortling )

14:59.564 --> 15:01.599
Well, I thought it was funny.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.367
( both scream )

15:06.671 --> 15:08.838
There's gotta be a flashlight
around somewhere.

15:08.839 --> 15:10.941
Are we afraid of the dark?

15:10.942 --> 15:12.610
Can we take out her batteries
or something?

15:12.611 --> 15:14.912
I can't find a candle,
a match, a torch--

15:14.913 --> 15:17.648
There's never an angry mob
around when you need one.

15:17.649 --> 15:19.383
Here's some light.

15:20.618 --> 15:22.853
Maybe we could put
a bag over her head.

¶ Merrily, merrily
Merrily, merrily ¶

15:27.759 --> 15:29.827
Sabrina, I know you went
to a lot of trouble,

15:29.828 --> 15:32.430
but sometimes pranks
can go too far.

what I'm talking about.

There's no spell
to stop killer dolls.

16:25.817 --> 16:27.618
Well, at least find one
to turn on the lights.

16:27.619 --> 16:28.819
I don't believe this.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.420
Clap on.

16:31.789 --> 16:33.157
Well, good. We have light.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.125
Maybe now we have a fighting
chance against Molly.

fool us this time.

Sit here. Ah, ah, ah--

to switch your brains

of the two chickens over there.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.365
What? You will
do no such thing.

You should have heard
the chickens complaining.

I was a coward worked.

18:01.112 --> 18:02.612
Ah. Okay.

18:02.613 --> 18:04.214
All I have to do
is go wrestle Frankenstein,

18:04.215 --> 18:06.383
the mummy
and all those other freaks.

18:06.384 --> 18:07.985
I'll go get my aunts.

18:07.986 --> 18:10.087
You'll never get away with this.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.222
You'd better hope Aunt Beulah
saved your receipt.

18:14.558 --> 18:15.959
You don't toy with Sabrina,

18:38.216 --> 18:39.916
Could you be a little bit
more specific?

18:39.917 --> 18:42.219
What a lovely cranium,
my dear.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.553
Mind if I borrow it?

You leave her alone.

Okay, so,

Well, first, we've got

to figure out how we can

not be chickens anymore.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.007
That's my name too.

19:04.008 --> 19:06.776
ZELDA:
Aunt Beulah, please don't turn
Sabrina into a chicken.

19:06.777 --> 19:08.412
She's so young.

19:08.413 --> 19:09.813
And high school's so--

19:09.814 --> 19:11.949
Oh, no.
Something's happening to me.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.116
I'm laying an egg.

19:13.117 --> 19:14.818
Oh, that's what happened to me

19:14.819 --> 19:19.022
when I tried to do <i>Music Man</i>
in dinner theater.

19:19.023 --> 19:20.023
Don't worry.

19:20.024 --> 19:22.927
Nothing's going to happen
to Sabrina.

19:22.928 --> 19:25.195
This isn't an insane asylum.

19:25.196 --> 19:26.830
It's a theme party.

19:26.831 --> 19:28.999
You mean this whole thing
is a joke?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.968
If you'd come to my last
500 parties, you would know.

19:31.969 --> 19:34.938
Last year,
we had a prison riot.

19:34.939 --> 19:36.573
Excuse me. I hate
to be the only adult here,

19:36.574 --> 19:39.175
but I have a problem
with my doll.

19:39.176 --> 19:42.046
Oh, no, I hope
I didn't send you the wrong one.

19:42.047 --> 19:43.681
Zelda...

19:43.682 --> 19:45.916
and Hilda...

19:45.917 --> 19:47.651
let's go.

19:47.652 --> 19:49.687
HILDA:
I know I'm a healthy
alternative to red meat,

19:49.688 --> 19:51.622
but change me back.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.456
( growling )

19:53.457 --> 19:55.592
Isn't this fun? Hee-hee.

19:55.593 --> 19:56.626
See what she's doing?

19:56.627 --> 19:59.729
Oh, what's the problem?

19:59.730 --> 20:01.131
This is the right doll.

20:01.132 --> 20:03.467
I thought Molly
would be fun for Halloween.

20:03.468 --> 20:04.901
No. You see, in this realm,

20:04.902 --> 20:07.338
we don't give toys like this
to children.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.605
Fine. I'll stop her.

20:08.606 --> 20:09.640
( clears throat )

20:09.641 --> 20:11.875
( belting out high note )

20:11.876 --> 20:14.444
I'll stop terrorizing
if you stop yelling.

20:14.445 --> 20:16.880
Deal.
Okay, guys, pack it up.

20:16.881 --> 20:18.048
Party's over.

20:18.049 --> 20:19.216
( grunts )

20:23.121 --> 20:24.721
( laughing )

20:24.722 --> 20:25.789
( all laughing )

20:27.592 --> 20:30.327
Oh, you should have seen
the look on your faces.

20:30.328 --> 20:31.662
Great prank, huh?

20:31.663 --> 20:33.763
Yeah, it was great, uh,

20:33.764 --> 20:35.798
but we were onto you.

20:35.799 --> 20:38.001
So you guys wanna stay and watch
the rest of the movies?

20:38.002 --> 20:39.236
( in unison ):
No!

20:42.974 --> 20:44.608
Oh, honey, are you okay?

20:44.609 --> 20:45.909
( clucks )

20:45.910 --> 20:46.943
Excuse me.

20:46.944 --> 20:48.811
Oh, sure. It's not every day

20:48.812 --> 20:51.148
a girl has Frankenstein,
the Mummy, a vampire,

20:51.149 --> 20:53.583
the Headless Horseman and
a werewolf on her double date.

20:53.584 --> 20:56.152
Molly, I didn't tell you
to send a werewolf.

20:56.153 --> 20:57.354
And I didn't.

20:57.355 --> 20:58.755
( growls )

20:58.756 --> 21:01.591
I think I finally
got him calmed down.

21:01.592 --> 21:04.461
Don't make any sudden noises.

21:04.462 --> 21:06.563
( all screaming )

21:09.600 --> 21:11.869
Was it real, or wasn't it?

21:11.870 --> 21:13.603
I know that was scary,

21:13.604 --> 21:15.004
but don't worry, kids.

21:15.005 --> 21:18.075
It's all behind us now.

21:18.076 --> 21:19.876
( Hilda screaming )

21:21.713 --> 21:23.013
Hilda,
get ahold of yourself.

21:24.249 --> 21:25.815
Oh! Thanks.

21:25.816 --> 21:27.417
I needed that.

21:27.418 --> 21:28.752
Oh, no. We've been invited

21:28.753 --> 21:30.954
to Aunt Beulah's
Halloween party.

21:30.955 --> 21:32.856
Aunt Beulah?
I've never met her.

21:32.857 --> 21:33.757
Huh?

21:33.758 --> 21:34.858
( screams )

21:34.859 --> 21:36.326
It never ends!

21:36.327 --> 21:38.828
( screaming )
