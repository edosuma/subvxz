01:28.004 --> 01:29.089
<i>Trish?</i>

01:29.172 --> 01:31.257
Trish, look at me. Trish!

01:32.092 --> 01:33.510
I need to get you out of here.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.055
Is he dead?

01:38.014 --> 01:39.516
No, he's unconscious.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.851
But he's losing a lot of blood.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.147
The NYPD is on its way.
You just blew through two cops out there.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.358
They didn't see my face.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.527
But he did.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.657
If you kill him, then you're the bad guy.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.450
Down here, 6D.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.578
- Holy shit. Let's go.
- No.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.250
Move! Move!

02:10.672 --> 02:11.923
Jesus. Look at him.

02:14.592 --> 02:17.112
- What's his status?
- He's got a pulse.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.513
Get a medic up here.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.199
Easy.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.097
It's real...

03:02.682 --> 03:03.683
isn't it?

03:08.813 --> 03:10.648
She's gone, Jess.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.612
She's dead.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.853
We're gonna get through this.

04:26.224 --> 04:30.144
<i>I was strong
way before I gave a shit.</i>

04:30.228 --> 04:32.855
<i>But you gave a shit
long before you were even strong.</i>

04:34.983 --> 04:36.276
<i>But we figured it out.</i>

04:38.861 --> 04:40.697
<i>My mom would've been proud of that.</i>

04:42.865 --> 04:44.867
<i>But your mom was always proud.</i>

04:46.953 --> 04:49.247
You are who you are because of Dorothy.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.417
I've gotta give her that.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.521
Trish, we gotta make some decisions.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.400
I know.

05:18.318 --> 05:22.572
When Sallinger wakes up, he'll ID you.
If he hasn't already.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.034
You'll face assault charges,

05:26.117 --> 05:29.746
and the attack on Sallinger
will be viewed as...

05:29.829 --> 05:31.039
Attempted murder.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.457
They'll put you away.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.710
Or worse.
That's what they do to people like us.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.295
I'm getting you out of the city.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.548
Not until we bring him down.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.509
We can't do that if you're a wanted felon.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.267
Let's just see what we're up against.

05:52.518 --> 05:53.895
- Costa.
<i>- Jones.</i>

05:56.356 --> 05:57.482
I'm sorry.

05:59.317 --> 06:03.363
Your friend Malcolm Ducasse called it in.
He said... Trish found her?

06:05.740 --> 06:08.534
<i>- Is she okay?</i>
- No.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.745
<i>I want you to bring her in.</i>

06:11.662 --> 06:12.497
Why?

06:12.580 --> 06:15.017
'Cause if your mother was a target,
your sister could be next,

06:15.041 --> 06:17.168
<i>and we can protect her.</i>

06:17.251 --> 06:18.878
I have her at a safe location.

06:18.961 --> 06:22.507
<i>Okay, good. Sallinger was careful.</i>

06:23.299 --> 06:25.676
<i>So far, the scene is clean.</i>

06:25.760 --> 06:27.512
Jones, it was personal.

06:27.595 --> 06:30.431
An attack on Mrs. Walker
is an attack on you.

06:30.515 --> 06:31.516
<i>I know.</i>

06:33.434 --> 06:35.269
Do you know someone hit him back?

06:35.812 --> 06:37.230
<i>Just got out of surgery.</i>

06:37.772 --> 06:39.440
<i>Sallinger nearly died.</i>

06:39.524 --> 06:41.818
- Good.
<i>- He said it was that masked vigilante.</i>

06:41.901 --> 06:44.987
She clawed half his face off
with her bare hands.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.614
Then she went easy on him.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.574
Jones, he's going down.

06:49.450 --> 06:52.328
The hairs we found on Silva's body
are on their way to the lab.

06:53.329 --> 06:57.417
He's done, unless... she gets in our way.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.378
- What else did Sallinger say?
<i>- That he fears for his life.</i>

07:00.461 --> 07:04.173
<i>We've got cops on him
until we can bring her in.</i>

07:08.136 --> 07:09.679
If I found her...

07:10.263 --> 07:12.140
<i>she would need guarantees.</i>

07:12.223 --> 07:13.808
Immunity, whatever.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.059
<i>I can't promise that.</i>

07:15.143 --> 07:18.563
Not with the way, uh...
things are playing out now.

07:18.646 --> 07:22.275
- How's it playing out?
<i>- Turn on WJBP News.</i>

07:29.949 --> 07:33.035
<i>You may recognize this woman
from her appearance outside...</i>

07:33.119 --> 07:36.581
- I'll be in touch.
<i>- ...of the GT Agrochemical building.</i>

07:36.664 --> 07:40.293
<i>We now have evidence
that this unidentified criminal</i>

07:40.376 --> 07:44.755
<i>is responsible for a rash of attacks
on the people of our city.</i>

07:44.839 --> 07:47.008
<i>Gregory Sallinger nearly lost his life</i>

07:47.091 --> 07:50.970
<i>at the hands
of this monstrous powered creature.</i>

07:51.053 --> 07:52.305
Shit.

07:52.388 --> 07:55.516
<i>In light
of the NYPD's failure to act,</i>

07:55.600 --> 07:59.020
we have decided
to stop this violent offender ourselves.

07:59.103 --> 08:03.649
Hogarth & Associates is prepared
to offer a $250,000 reward

08:04.233 --> 08:09.197
for the successful identification
of this vigilante plaguing our streets.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.699
I will unmask her.

08:12.575 --> 08:16.162
And in doing so, I will lead the charge

08:16.245 --> 08:19.207
<i>to take back our city
from those who consider themselves...</i>

08:20.958 --> 08:22.585
The whole city will be looking for me.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.669
I'll get you out.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.058
What?

08:40.686 --> 08:41.938
I gotta go check on something.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.398
- Did Sallinger ID me?
- That's what I need to find out.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.442
Well, I can't just sit here
and do nothing.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.570
You have to. Please.
Just until I get some answers.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.324
Just, please, don't go anywhere.

09:08.589 --> 09:09.632
Jeri...

09:11.092 --> 09:12.468
are you sure this is the way?

09:13.010 --> 09:16.222
Yes, Sallinger raises our profile,
maybe brings in some new clients, but...

09:16.305 --> 09:17.625
You're questioning my motivation.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.059
I'm saying that Sallinger
is the real threat to the city.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.978
He just killed again.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.481
What happened to Dorothy Walker
is sickening.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.109
But there is a system in place
to deal with that.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.987
And what it can't and won't do

09:31.070 --> 09:36.284
is unmask a woman guilty of theft,
assault and, now, attempted murder.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.954
Your assignment has not changed, Malcolm.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.455
Find her.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.792
And if I have to pay that reward
because my own investigator failed,

09:45.459 --> 09:46.794
we'll have a problem.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.053
Where are you?

09:57.471 --> 09:58.471
I need your help.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.184
I'm just so sorry about your mother.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.522
Trish needs your help.

10:07.356 --> 10:08.357
She lost it, Jess.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.443
<i>She found her mother dead, Malcolm.</i>

10:10.526 --> 10:14.363
Drenched in blood,
stabbed over and over, and tortured.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.698
<i>What would you have done?</i>

10:17.700 --> 10:20.369
There's a key to Trish's apartment
in my top desk drawer.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.573
I need you to bring her some clothes
and her passport.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.126
Tell me where she is.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.057
Dude, your patient is due
upstairs in plastic surgery.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.643
Uh, Admitting told me
to get him settled in 823 South.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.312
Take it up with
the charge nurse. I'll get him back up.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.189
Nobody tells me anything.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.775
Hey. Who's on charge right now?

10:58.866 --> 11:02.703
My little portrait
really captured her rage, didn't it?

11:03.913 --> 11:07.958
It was supposed to be you.
I was trying to capture your true nature.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.211
You don't want to see my true nature.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.879
I've already had a peek.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.298
What... do you want?

11:14.382 --> 11:18.427
To stay out of prison.
And for you to help me with that.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.846
Maybe I'll finish what she started.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.017
You want me to be afraid.

11:27.561 --> 11:31.899
But it's you
that's scared out of your mind.

11:31.982 --> 11:32.983
Of you?

11:33.984 --> 11:35.361
Try again, asshole.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.905
No, you're scared of losing her.

11:38.823 --> 11:42.868
You've failed so many people
that she's all you have left.

11:42.952 --> 11:47.748
So you're going to destroy
any evidence on Nathan Silva's body

11:47.832 --> 11:50.209
- that can be traced back to me.
- No.

11:50.292 --> 11:55.464
That picture is triggered for release
the second I'm arrested.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.591
You know where she'll end up.

11:58.384 --> 12:02.471
Nobody knows what happens
to prisoners on the Raft...

12:03.264 --> 12:05.975
because nobody ever hears from them again.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.190
And how do I know that you
would hold up your end of the bargain?

12:13.899 --> 12:20.030
You'll trust that I'll hold up my end,
because you have no choice.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.247
If anything happens to her,

12:29.290 --> 12:32.418
I swear to God, I will destroy you.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.765
I need research on the NYPD crime lab
in Jamaica, Queens.

12:46.474 --> 12:50.269
The schematics, photos,
security protocols.

12:56.692 --> 13:00.070
- The phone's ringing.
- This is a box. These are my things.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.740
A person of empathy might understand
the intent of its pairing.

13:03.991 --> 13:07.119
The press keeps calling,
asking about your crazed vigilante pal

13:07.203 --> 13:10.206
who apparently shreds people's faces
with her bare hands.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.876
I quit.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.131
This really isn't a good time.

13:22.092 --> 13:24.929
A person of empathy would get that.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.266
I'm so sorry about Dorothy.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.520
She was a force.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.360
She's got no comment, asshole!

13:39.443 --> 13:40.694
Well, that's a first.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.153
Let's see what we can find
on the crime lab in Jamaica.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.213
Your timing blows.

14:01.048 --> 14:04.009
I got Brianna back to Georgia,
back on her meds.

14:05.135 --> 14:08.556
And then I made the mistake
of turning on the news.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.310
- I am so...
- Don't. I...

14:15.938 --> 14:18.107
I can't handle
any more condolences right now.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.861
Alias Investigations.
No, she doesn't have a comment.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.114
Can we talk?

14:32.663 --> 14:35.416
How about you let the woman bury
her mother first, shithead?

14:41.797 --> 14:42.798
I wish...

14:45.134 --> 14:46.343
a lot of things.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.349
But if I'd agreed
to put him away for kidnapping...

15:01.609 --> 15:02.818
I want to help.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.488
What do you need?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.659
To hide Trish.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.914
Done. She can stay at my pad.

15:14.997 --> 15:15.997
Permanently.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.750
Ah.

15:17.833 --> 15:22.922
It's tough for a celebrity,
with cell phones, Internet and her show.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.883
Which is syndicated in 160 countries.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.554
Mmm-hmm. What's the alternative?

15:33.223 --> 15:35.893
To do the last goddamn thing
I ever wanted to do.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.479
In order to take down Sallinger?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.273
In order to save Trish.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.737
Is that a... either-or?

15:49.281 --> 15:50.366
Shit.

15:51.659 --> 15:55.579
I can't let him get away with it,
but I won't let her pay the price.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.165
Well, what would she say?

15:58.248 --> 15:59.959
She'd sacrifice everything.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.670
It's heroic.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.754
I'm not.

16:06.590 --> 16:07.758
I won't let her do it.

16:10.052 --> 16:14.723
Then we do the last thing on earth
that you wanna do.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.517
Not "we."

16:17.935 --> 16:20.562
Unless you know
how to break into a police crime lab.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.900
Hmm.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.194
What? Are you a master thief, too?

16:27.945 --> 16:32.533
No, but... I can ask a... favor.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.661
You got any aspirin?

16:47.506 --> 16:49.258
- There's someone here to...
- Not now.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.261
It's Laurent Lyonne.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.389
He's at my desk, actually.
You've been on back-to-back calls.

16:58.809 --> 16:59.809
Send him in.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.189
You can go in.

17:09.611 --> 17:10.612
Uh...

17:11.989 --> 17:14.407
How are you? How... How's it going?

17:14.491 --> 17:18.244
Uh, you know... it gets better.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.372
Incrementally.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.002
- And your mom? She...
- She doesn't know I'm here.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.967
I saw what you did.
That you're trying to change.

17:32.843 --> 17:36.180
- Your press conference...
- it's everywhere.

17:38.974 --> 17:39.975
Are you good?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.102
- I'm sorry. I...
- At your job.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.231
Yes. Very.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.028
I have a dead sister and a dead dad.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.364
And now my mom
is about to lose everything.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.159
She's too proud to come to you.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.370
Well, the only thing she did wrong
was marry an embezzler.

18:02.372 --> 18:06.168
Who... was also a very disturbed man.

18:06.710 --> 18:07.920
"Embezzler" is accurate.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.464
And the foundation
he stole from is pissed.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.757
The donors filed suit.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.301
Well, the facts will prove
that Kith was not involved.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.178
I'm... I'm sure that they'll settle.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.679
All but one.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.973
Demetri Patseras.

18:20.641 --> 18:25.187
He's a... was a friend of my parents,
before something happened.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.397
I was maybe 15,
so they didn't tell me shit,

18:27.481 --> 18:30.776
but my mom's lawyer said
that Demetri won't back off.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.613
Well, then she needs a new lawyer.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.412
Don't hurt her.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.415
More.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.501
Don't hurt her more.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.086
Please.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.903
Officer Carl Nussbaumer.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.073
He comes here every night
at the start of his beat.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.785
He's served 20 decorated years
on the force...

19:22.369 --> 19:24.621
and he's also a murderer.

19:25.205 --> 19:27.499
I found three uncleared homicides
on his watch.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.085
All drug dealers,
all chalked up to street crime.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.004
It's his idea of justice?

19:32.087 --> 19:36.091
It's his idea of a payday.
He stole their product and their cash.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.179
Some of which he used to pay me
ten grand in blackmail money.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.848
Thanks, Tony.
See you tomorrow.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.562
He doesn't know your face.
Let's keep it that way.

19:52.482 --> 19:53.734
Officer Nussbaumer.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.487
We have something we need to discuss.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.991
Sorry, ma'am. My shift doesn't
officially start until I've had my coffee.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.576
I work for someone you know.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.538
Or rather someone that knows you.

20:07.915 --> 20:12.669
And would you believe that he spent
that entire 10K all in one place?

20:20.594 --> 20:22.763
You're that powered chick from the news.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.406
You gonna use
your super strength on me?

20:24.473 --> 20:26.058
You gonna make me?

20:26.141 --> 20:28.602
Muscle for a blackmailer.

20:28.685 --> 20:31.939
It's not exactly the hero
a kid wants on his lunch box.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.607
Me and your boss are square.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.250
I don't want your money,
something else.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.568
I don't owe you anything.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.905
Access to the crime lab
in Jamaica, Queens.

20:40.614 --> 20:44.701
A clear path of entry,
in and out, with no trace.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.454
Yeah, sure.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.957
Sure, I'll just march you
right in the front door.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.210
You will. Unless you wanna land in prison,

20:54.002 --> 20:57.089
rubbing dicks
with every perp you ever arrested.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.259
All right, look, lady. I got powers, too.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.386
It's called a badge.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.055
And it allows me
to beat the shit out of you

21:05.138 --> 21:08.183
- just for that mouth right...
- You paid up, but we are not square,

21:08.267 --> 21:09.851
- you piece of sh...
- Who the...

21:12.062 --> 21:13.063
We need him.

21:19.027 --> 21:25.075
You're gonna march me in there tonight,
or I will deliver you to IA myself.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.462
My shift ends at 2:00 a.m.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.925
Be at the lab's loading dock at 2:45.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.849
Stupid, showing your face to me.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.023
What the hell was that?

21:56.857 --> 22:01.320
He's still at it. I can feel it.
It's worse than before.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.740
I could have stopped him.

22:05.574 --> 22:09.703
But, instead, I took his money
and I pissed it away on a card game.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.122
Come on.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.221
Hey.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.932
Jessica thought you
might need some clothes.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.870
- Nice digs.
- Yeah.

22:51.953 --> 22:57.042
I guess the best places to hide out
are the places no one else wants to go.

22:59.419 --> 23:00.754
Hey, I'm...

23:02.506 --> 23:03.715
I'm so sorry.

23:05.717 --> 23:09.971
I know you probably blame yourself.
It's not your fault, Trish.

23:10.764 --> 23:11.765
I know.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.351
Sallinger did this.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.980
Despite everything on my side,

23:19.064 --> 23:22.067
the good, the right, they still win.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.235
God damn it!

23:23.318 --> 23:26.363
- I'll go over there and see...
- No, no, no, don't. Don't.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.616
I'm supposed to be hiding out.

23:37.541 --> 23:40.961
You know, they don't always.
Win. They don't always win.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.925
They do enough
that I can't do this anymore.

23:52.597 --> 23:53.807
Good.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.063
Was there something else?

24:01.148 --> 24:02.149
No.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.320
I hope it helps.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.082
Really beautiful work, everyone.
See you next week.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.227
- Nice solo.
- Really? It felt flat.

24:21.251 --> 24:23.729
- No, you were awesome.
- Want to grab a drink?

24:23.753 --> 24:24.753
Bye.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.715
- Have a good one.
- See ya.

24:31.636 --> 24:34.014
- No.
- You haven't returned my calls.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.492
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Well, you need to talk to me.

24:36.516 --> 24:39.811
You need a lawyer who will go
up against Demetri Patseras.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.689
I'm leaving.

24:42.772 --> 24:43.773
I love you.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.068
I never stopped.

24:48.111 --> 24:53.366
And when I saw you again, so unhappy
and unable to find a way out, I...

24:54.326 --> 24:57.204
I did what I did for you.

24:58.622 --> 25:03.210
Twenty-five years later,
and you're still a selfish manipulator.

25:03.293 --> 25:07.130
Every decision, every tiny duplicitous act

25:07.214 --> 25:09.925
is always about Jeri Hogarth
and no one else.

25:10.800 --> 25:14.262
That's not love.
I don't want to hear any more.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.347
Tough shit!

25:15.430 --> 25:16.848
- You want honesty?
- Ugh!

25:16.932 --> 25:22.646
Our senior year, during finals,
I met Wendy in the stacks, okay?

25:22.729 --> 25:27.442
I went down on her in the library bathroom
that same night.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.903
We slept together for three months
before you found out.

25:30.904 --> 25:34.574
It was the challenge, the thrill of...
of having you both.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.537
I found you too soon. I...

25:40.205 --> 25:42.290
I wasn't ready to have a soul mate.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.086
I didn't even know if I believed in that.

25:46.878 --> 25:47.879
I do now.

25:50.674 --> 25:54.177
I followed you over the years.
I... I scoured social media.

25:54.261 --> 25:57.305
I knew where you lived.
I-I... I knew where you worked.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.809
Because I knew that one day
I would be ready.

26:03.979 --> 26:08.942
And when I was,
I had my investigator dig into Peter.

26:09.025 --> 26:11.778
I just thought it was a stroke of luck...

26:11.861 --> 26:15.156
...when I found out
he was a fraud and a cheat.

26:17.659 --> 26:21.621
I regret my part in his death,
but I would do it again,

26:21.705 --> 26:23.832
because I goddamn love you!

26:29.838 --> 26:31.673
The truth is overrated.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.719
You're in trouble. You need my help.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.514
Laurent came to me.

26:40.807 --> 26:45.562
He... He asked me to help you.
He's scared, Kith.

27:03.079 --> 27:05.915
There's a few stray hairs
on the third floor of this building.

27:07.959 --> 27:11.129
They're all that was found
on Nathan Silva's rotting corpse.

27:14.341 --> 27:18.762
They belong to Sallinger,
and they would... put him away for good.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.221
Yeah.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.932
I'd say you're doing
the right thing, but...

27:24.601 --> 27:27.604
the right thing
is new territory for me, so...

27:31.566 --> 27:33.026
I did do the right thing once.

27:35.695 --> 27:38.657
After I got it, my power,

27:38.740 --> 27:40.617
I came home from college...

27:41.242 --> 27:43.161
and the first person I saw was my dad.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.414
The guy I worshiped my whole life.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.211
And I nearly puked
from the darkness coming off of him.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.464
I mean, he was my dad.

27:54.547 --> 27:57.967
Took me fishing,
headed up his fantasy football league.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.387
Brianna had moved out by then.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.682
She got depressed.
She failed out of school and...

28:04.516 --> 28:07.143
Mom complained
that she never came home anymore.

28:09.437 --> 28:12.857
I started thinking... "Why?"

28:13.733 --> 28:17.654
Thinking about how my dad
used to stay up late at night,

28:18.738 --> 28:21.199
helping Brie with her homework.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.868
Locked in her room.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.456
Father-daughter time.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.547
And it'd been going on for years.

28:39.342 --> 28:43.179
Then I cornered him,
forced him to admit it.

28:46.307 --> 28:48.393
And the day they took him away...

28:50.311 --> 28:54.649
my mother... overdosed on pills.

28:57.110 --> 29:00.447
And Brianna... she blamed me.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.034
Said it wasn't my truth to tell.

29:07.203 --> 29:13.626
So that was the first and last time
I used my power for... so-called good.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.507
Just logged out
of the system.

30:24.572 --> 30:26.533
So how long could it take?
Forty minutes?

30:26.616 --> 30:29.452
It's 3:00 in the morning,
and I have a husband to get home to.

30:29.536 --> 30:32.997
Me, too. But there's
a lot of people waiting on answers.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.542
Come on. It's personal.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.544
Okay. Only 'cause it's you, Eddy.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.629
I need to get them out of there, now.

30:39.712 --> 30:43.174
<i>Okay, let me look. Uh...</i>

30:43.258 --> 30:47.470
Got it. Head to the western stairwell.
Take that to the basement.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.389
<i>What's in the basement?</i>

30:49.472 --> 30:50.348
The sewer main.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.933
Shit.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.715
You're breathing on me, Eddy.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.675
I'm not breathing... at all.

31:25.758 --> 31:28.094
Jesus. What the hell did you eat today?

31:28.177 --> 31:29.178
What? I...

31:31.222 --> 31:32.599
Oh, Christ.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.184
Ugh. I'm gonna be sick.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.771
- Call maintenance.
- At this hour?

31:38.855 --> 31:42.442
Gotta clear out.
We've got a situation here. Obviously.

31:42.525 --> 31:43.651
It's just shit.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.279
Shit's the least toxic thing
in these pipes.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.865
You can't stay in the building.
Biohazard protocol.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.750
You gonna stand in that shit puddle
until the hazmat guys get here?

32:14.349 --> 32:15.433
Ugh.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.221
Has it changed?

33:37.724 --> 33:39.559
My aura or whatever?

33:41.519 --> 33:42.645
You're still you.

33:53.990 --> 33:54.991
Excuse me.

34:02.915 --> 34:04.167
Yes?

34:04.250 --> 34:05.251
<i>It's done.</i>

34:06.461 --> 34:07.712
Then so are we.

34:14.552 --> 34:15.803
Let's get on with it.

34:39.368 --> 34:40.369
Trish.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.456
Jess, where have you b...

34:46.708 --> 34:48.252
What the hell is he doing here?

34:48.335 --> 34:52.090
I wanted to look you in the eye
and explain... make things right.

34:52.172 --> 34:53.757
You want me to absolve you...

34:54.634 --> 34:58.763
for the fact that my mother died
because you're a goddamn coward!

34:58.846 --> 35:00.014
Jesus. Trish...

35:03.851 --> 35:07.313
I can take a hit when it's... righteous.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.023
You don't deserve my forgiveness.

35:09.816 --> 35:10.817
I know.

35:21.369 --> 35:24.330
You have no idea
what he did for you tonight.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.832
All right, what did he do?

35:26.958 --> 35:29.836
He helped me with the Sallinger situation.

35:30.545 --> 35:31.754
What does that mean?

35:36.634 --> 35:37.844
Jess, tell me.

35:42.056 --> 35:44.225
Sallinger wanted me
to destroy the evidence

35:44.308 --> 35:46.352
that proved he killed Nathan Silva.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.563
No.

35:51.774 --> 35:55.695
- No. No. No, no, no.
- It was the only way to protect you.

35:55.778 --> 35:58.781
I told you I didn't care,
that I would go to jail.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.367
All that matters is nailing Sallinger.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.043
Then you and I
have very different priorities.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.247
You... Then tell him the deal is off.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.584
Tell him that you changed your mind
and that the deal is off.

36:11.085 --> 36:12.378
It's already done.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.675
He tortured and killed her.

36:18.259 --> 36:22.763
And he will never pay for it.
But he has to pay for somebody's death.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.476
Please.

36:30.104 --> 36:35.776
You have just obliterated my only win

36:36.319 --> 36:40.114
in a long, agonizing list of losses.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.786
I had to make a decision.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.874
Destroy him or save you.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.710
I choose you every day.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.479
What now?

37:21.364 --> 37:24.075
You let the cops see you
in your normal routine.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.454
You go to work, sell more sweaters.

37:28.537 --> 37:31.499
Don't forget my forthcoming line
of loungewear.

37:34.043 --> 37:37.713
And funeral arrangements
will need to be made.

37:39.465 --> 37:40.883
Oh, God.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.260
That we can do together.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.805
I'll go to the morgue and ID her.

37:50.851 --> 37:53.062
No.

37:54.188 --> 37:55.189
No.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.150
I wanna see her.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.999
I'll take care of the room.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.851
<i>There's blood on my hands.</i>

38:33.352 --> 38:35.104
<i>The kind that won't wash off.</i>

38:37.231 --> 38:39.692
Come on in. Just be careful.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.657
<i>I did something today.</i>

39:31.702 --> 39:33.579
<i>I set a murderer free.</i>

39:34.872 --> 39:37.124
Ma'am,
please, don't touch anything.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.668
I just want to see her.

39:41.796 --> 39:42.922
As she was.

39:43.923 --> 39:45.341
I'll give you a minute.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.854
<i>Trish needed a hero.</i>

40:06.654 --> 40:07.863
<i>She got me.</i>

40:23.754 --> 40:25.506
I have something for you.

40:25.589 --> 40:26.715
A name?

40:26.799 --> 40:28.509
Something else, actually.

40:29.135 --> 40:32.346
The security footage of the masked woman
in the file room was doctored...

40:33.389 --> 40:34.389
by me.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.381
And this is the missing footage

40:36.434 --> 40:39.687
in which you'll see me
when I caught her breaking in.

40:40.896 --> 40:41.939
And you...

40:42.022 --> 40:43.357
Let her go.

40:46.152 --> 40:47.820
You've been working both sides.

40:47.903 --> 40:49.321
Well, not anymore.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.657
- I quit.
- You're fired.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.162
Well...

40:57.705 --> 40:59.707
at least we're finally on the same page.

41:00.666 --> 41:05.045
Malcolm, we've... we've been
on the same page for some time now.

41:07.882 --> 41:10.384
We've been building a future together...

41:11.051 --> 41:12.261
you and me...

41:13.012 --> 41:14.096
and Zaya.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.557
Don't.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.394
Zaya has nothing to do with this.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.687
Why should I believe that?

41:22.229 --> 41:24.148
Why should I believe
anything that you say?

41:24.732 --> 41:28.736
You question my motives.
You vilify me and my life's work.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.779
You stole from me.

41:32.031 --> 41:34.283
You lied to me!

41:37.620 --> 41:39.288
I know what I've done...

41:39.830 --> 41:42.625
and I know what you've done.

41:45.127 --> 41:48.255
So I would...
I would think really long and hard

41:48.339 --> 41:51.592
before you ride out of here
on your high horse.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.765
Yeah.

41:59.391 --> 42:01.101
You know, I really thought about it...

42:01.936 --> 42:05.397
doing what you asked... for Zaya's sake.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.360
I thought about unmasking a woman

42:09.443 --> 42:13.697
who, for all of her flaws,
is at least trying to be a hero.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.242
While you protected a man...

42:16.325 --> 42:20.496
No, while we protected a man
who carves people up for sport.

42:21.080 --> 42:25.876
And if that's what you want from me,
if that's what Zaya wants from me...

42:28.045 --> 42:29.296
I'm out.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.343
You know who she is.

43:19.054 --> 43:20.055
Yeah?

43:21.348 --> 43:22.474
It's Costa.

43:31.108 --> 43:33.027
I didn't want to do this on the phone.

43:39.658 --> 43:41.285
So just say it.

43:43.621 --> 43:46.373
The hair we found
on Nathan Silva's body is gone.

43:49.168 --> 43:50.919
What do you mean "gone"?

43:51.670 --> 43:55.215
Accident at the lab. Screwed by a...

43:57.468 --> 43:58.636
electric fan.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.435
So what's our next move?

44:07.144 --> 44:08.270
There isn't one.

44:09.688 --> 44:12.858
I've been placed on leave,
effective tomorrow.

44:14.234 --> 44:15.569
That's bullshit.

44:15.653 --> 44:18.739
Bodies were piling up, a serial killer
kept slipping through the cracks.

44:18.822 --> 44:21.367
The department needed a fall guy.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.661
So the one guy that's
actually doing something,

44:23.744 --> 44:25.079
they take off the case.

44:26.121 --> 44:29.833
The press accused us of colluding
with powered vigilantes.

44:32.044 --> 44:33.420
I fit the bill.

44:33.921 --> 44:36.131
I'll tell them it was all me.

44:36.215 --> 44:38.217
- But...
- I acted alone.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.343
You didn't.

44:39.426 --> 44:42.262
I've taken your side
when maybe I shouldn't have

44:42.346 --> 44:44.306
because maybe we're friends.

44:46.475 --> 44:48.060
I don't have a lot of friends.

44:48.143 --> 44:50.187
Except ones who wear masks.

44:53.357 --> 44:54.358
It's okay.

44:55.275 --> 44:59.238
I'm glad she maimed that asshole.
I'm glad she's still out there.

45:00.197 --> 45:02.533
She tried to do what I couldn't.

45:10.290 --> 45:11.917
Maybe I need the break anyway.

45:16.171 --> 45:19.049
Don't... don't take this on, okay?

45:20.008 --> 45:22.052
The department is right. This is on me.

45:27.141 --> 45:28.142
Take care.

46:01.925 --> 46:03.635
Our financials...

46:04.887 --> 46:08.807
and everything you need to know
about the foundation.

46:10.559 --> 46:13.729
I'll have our forensic accountants
go through it, and...

46:14.855 --> 46:16.899
I'll circle back with recommendations.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.655
- Is there anything else?
- I don't want to talk about us

46:23.739 --> 46:24.740
or any of it.

46:24.823 --> 46:28.660
You feel remorse, guilt, for once,
and I will use it to my benefit.

46:28.744 --> 46:29.745
Do you understand?

47:03.987 --> 47:05.239
Jesus Christ.

47:38.230 --> 47:39.231
Are you ready?

47:52.160 --> 47:53.161
It's her.

48:13.390 --> 48:14.641
NYPD!

48:24.985 --> 48:26.278
You mind?

48:27.237 --> 48:29.077
We have the legal right
to search the premises.

48:29.114 --> 48:31.074
- For what?
- It's in the warrant.

48:42.419 --> 48:45.339
I'm Detective Imada.
That's Detective Defford.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.592
Ma'am, have you been drinking?

48:49.676 --> 48:51.053
I have a good excuse.

48:51.678 --> 48:53.865
Maybe you'll be sober
by the time we get to the station.

48:53.889 --> 48:56.308
- Am I under arrest?
- Just want to ask a few questions.

48:58.727 --> 49:01.688
Well, ask them here, Detective Imada.

49:02.481 --> 49:03.857
From what division?

49:03.941 --> 49:05.192
Homicide.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.655
Do you have a lead on the Walker murder?

49:11.573 --> 49:14.242
Tell us about your recent run-in
with Officer Carl Nussbaumer.

49:14.326 --> 49:15.911
A conversation, not a run-in.

49:15.994 --> 49:19.331
His body cam captured you approaching him,
then he turned it off. Why?

49:23.001 --> 49:24.962
Wait. Nussbaumer is the homicide?

49:25.045 --> 49:28.507
That's Officer Nussbaumer.
Twenty-year decorated vet.

49:28.590 --> 49:31.385
Beaten to death. We think it was personal.

49:32.928 --> 49:34.208
<i>I could have stopped him.</i>

49:34.262 --> 49:35.681
- ...not square...
- Who the...

49:35.764 --> 49:38.433
Can you account for
your whereabouts last night, Ms. Jones?
