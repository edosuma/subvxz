00:24.859 --> 00:27.404
After hours of getting
this thing right...

00:33.993 --> 00:35.829
God, look at that.
Look, I'm on television.

00:35.954 --> 00:38.540
- Hey! Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah, it is.

00:38.665 --> 00:40.709
- You're on TV in New York, too.
- What's that?

00:40.834 --> 00:42.377
- You're on TV in New York, too.
- No, no.

00:42.544 --> 00:44.754
- Yes, you are.
- Am I really? Are you serious?

00:44.879 --> 00:47.132
- Yeah, they got you in New York.
- God.

00:51.136 --> 00:53.304
I'm gonna let you
put it in your own ear.

00:53.430 --> 00:54.639
- Really?
- It's a talk back.

00:54.764 --> 00:58.560
- They're going to talk to you.
- This is not the real thing, right?

00:58.685 --> 01:00.019
You just want a picture of me now?

01:00.186 --> 01:02.897
- They're going to sit you here first.
- God.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.737
You need to tell me
where the restroom is, too,

01:08.862 --> 01:10.155
cos I'm deathly ill, actually,

01:10.321 --> 01:11.906
and ready to throw up
at any moment, so...

01:12.031 --> 01:16.369
- It's right across the hall.
- Great. I'm not joking.

01:24.377 --> 01:27.630
We're ready to go, gentlemen.
New York's waiting for a shot of him.

01:58.745 --> 02:02.457
If you see in my eyes,
I've been crying just a little bit.

02:02.582 --> 02:05.627
And it seems really ridiculous
because I've never met the man.

02:05.752 --> 02:11.549
I know life is ephemeral,
but I just, you know,

02:11.674 --> 02:14.594
I expected him to be around
a little longer.

02:14.719 --> 02:17.013
Pretty sure everybody did,
but, you know...

02:17.138 --> 02:21.142
The thing I'm using right now,
an iMac, he made.

02:21.267 --> 02:25.021
He made the iMac.
He made the Macbook.

02:25.146 --> 02:28.399
He made the Macbook Pro.
He made the Macbook Air.

02:28.525 --> 02:32.195
He made the iPhone.
He made the iPod.

02:34.030 --> 02:38.785
Yeah, he's made the iPod Touch.
He's made everything.

02:44.290 --> 02:49.546
<i># Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me</i>

02:49.712 --> 02:54.676
<i># I'm not sleepy
And there's no place I'm going to</i>

02:55.635 --> 03:01.474
<i># Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me</i>

03:01.599 --> 03:06.896
<i># In the jingle jangle morning
I'll come following you</i>

03:07.897 --> 03:12.068
It's not often that the whole
planet seems to feel a loss together,

03:12.193 --> 03:14.070
but after the death of Steve Jobs,

03:14.195 --> 03:17.156
co-founder of Apple
and singular dreamer,

03:17.282 --> 03:20.368
all day, we watched
as there was a kind of global wake.

03:20.493 --> 03:24.539
<i>On Facebook, millions changing
their profiles to the Apple logo.</i>

03:24.664 --> 03:28.167
<i>A kind of black armband,
a gesture of gratitude.</i>

03:28.376 --> 03:32.547
<i>We've been monitoring
the hashtag "thankyousteve."</i>

03:32.672 --> 03:34.382
<i>My favorite tweet last night</i>

03:34.591 --> 03:39.178
<i>was four simple letters
simply saying, "iSad."</i>

03:52.567 --> 03:53.860
Hi.

03:57.989 --> 04:01.159
<i>When Steve Jobs died,
I was mystified.</i>

04:01.284 --> 04:05.079
<i>What accounted for the grief of
millions of people who didn't know him?</i>

04:05.204 --> 04:08.583
<i>I'd seen it with John Lennon
and Martin Luther king,</i>

04:08.708 --> 04:12.295
<i>but Steve Jobs wasn't a singer
or a civil-rights leader.</i>

04:13.504 --> 04:16.673
Many commentators
were surprised

04:16.798 --> 04:21.887
by the intensity and the power
of this wave of emotion.

04:22.012 --> 04:27.018
What was it?
And I think it was truly love.

04:27.143 --> 04:33.191
Jobs has proven to be the one
and only person in the world

04:33.316 --> 04:38.613
who can create
technology products that people love.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.909
Wall-E.

04:43.785 --> 04:47.205
<i>I love "Wall-E,"
a film Jobs's Pixar produced,</i>

04:47.330 --> 04:49.540
<i>and I love my iPhone,</i>

04:49.749 --> 04:54.045
<i>but the grief for Jobs seemed to go
beyond the products he left behind.</i>

04:54.170 --> 04:57.590
<i>We mourned the man himself,
but why?</i>

04:57.715 --> 05:01.886
<i>Behind the scenes, Jobs could be
ruthless, deceitful and cruel.</i>

05:02.011 --> 05:07.308
<i>Yet he won our hearts by convincing us
that Apple represented a higher ideal.</i>

05:07.433 --> 05:11.688
<i>It was not like other companies.
It was different.</i>

05:13.731 --> 05:18.611
Good morning and welcome to Apple's
1984 annual shareholders' meeting.

05:18.736 --> 05:21.155
I'd like to open the meeting
with part of an old poem,

05:21.280 --> 05:24.450
about a 20-year-old poem, by Dylan.
That's Bob Dylan.

05:26.494 --> 05:29.706
"Come writers and critics
who prophesize with your pens

05:29.831 --> 05:32.417
and keep your eyes wide,
the chance won't come again."

05:32.583 --> 05:35.294
"And don't speak too soon
for the wheel's still in spin

05:35.461 --> 05:37.839
and there's no telling
who that it's naming."

05:37.964 --> 05:42.719
"For the loser now will be later to win,
for the times, they are a-changing."

05:42.927 --> 05:46.848
<i>Jobs loved Dylan
maybe because he wasnâ€™t just one thing.</i>

05:47.015 --> 05:51.436
<i>He was a storyteller who could
be whatever we wanted him to be.</i>

05:52.645 --> 05:55.982
I don't even what know what
<i>All Along The Watchtower</i> means.

05:56.107 --> 05:58.401
I think it is one of
the most beautiful, haunting,

05:58.526 --> 06:04.323
brilliant pieces of poetry ever.
And to me, it's like Steve.

06:05.867 --> 06:09.120
"There must be some way
out of here, said the..."

06:09.245 --> 06:10.163
What is it?

06:10.288 --> 06:11.914
<i>Said the Joker to the Thief.</i>

06:12.248 --> 06:13.624
He's both.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.934
<i># "There must be
Some way out of here"</i>

06:32.060 --> 06:34.020
<i># Said the joker to the thief</i>

06:35.146 --> 06:38.566
<i># There's too much confusion</i>

06:38.733 --> 06:40.568
<i># I can't get no relief</i>

06:41.944 --> 06:44.655
<i># Businessmen, they drink my wine</i>

06:44.781 --> 06:48.201
<i># Plowmen dig my earth</i>

06:48.326 --> 06:51.370
<i># None of them along the line</i>

06:51.496 --> 06:54.665
<i># Know what any of it is worth</i>

07:31.869 --> 07:34.038
<i>There's something going on
here in life</i>

07:34.163 --> 07:38.000
<i>beyond just a job and a family
and career.</i>

07:38.126 --> 07:40.878
<i>There's another side of the coin.</i>

07:44.340 --> 07:45.716
<i>It's the same thing</i>

07:45.883 --> 07:50.221
<i>that causes people to want to be poets
instead of bankers.</i>

07:51.931 --> 07:57.311
<i>And I think that that same spirit
can be put into products.</i>

07:57.436 --> 07:59.897
<i>And those products can be manufactured
and given to people,</i>

08:00.022 --> 08:02.358
<i>and they can sense that spirit.</i>

08:05.653 --> 08:09.115
<i>A computer is a straightforward,
everyday machine.</i>

08:09.240 --> 08:11.993
<i>A simple way of studying
the principle of how it works</i>

08:12.118 --> 08:15.246
<i>is that a computer is quite dead.</i>

08:15.371 --> 08:18.416
<i>It can do nothing without
someone to give instructions.</i>

08:20.376 --> 08:23.546
<i>When I was growing up,
computers weren't something to love.</i>

08:23.671 --> 08:25.464
<i>They were something to fear.</i>

08:25.590 --> 08:29.886
<i>They were huge, impersonal,
made by faceless corporations.</i>

08:30.011 --> 08:33.139
<i>But for Jobs, it was different.</i>

08:33.264 --> 08:36.183
I saw my first computer
when I was 12 at NASA.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.645
<i>We had a local NASA center
nearby. It was a terminal,</i>

08:39.812 --> 08:42.190
<i>which was connected
to a big computer somewhere.</i>

08:42.315 --> 08:45.109
This is one of the consoles
they might be using in the future.

08:45.276 --> 08:47.445
It looks very much like
just a regular typewriter.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.030
Too often the equipment of the past

08:49.155 --> 08:51.032
has sort of been designed
for other machines.

08:51.157 --> 08:52.325
They're really not for people.

08:52.450 --> 08:57.038
I saw my second computer a few
years later, the Hewlett-Packard 9100.

08:57.163 --> 08:59.957
The 9100 computing calculator.

09:00.082 --> 09:05.087
It was very large. Had a very small
cathode ray tube on it for display.

09:05.213 --> 09:08.841
And I got a chance to play with
one of those maybe in 1968.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.509
<i>I started going up</i>

09:10.635 --> 09:13.763
<i>to Hewlett-Packard's Palo Alto
research lab every Tuesday night,</i>

09:13.888 --> 09:18.059
and I spent every spare moment I had
trying to write programs for it.

09:18.184 --> 09:19.268
I was so fascinated by this.

09:21.479 --> 09:23.940
We have a pointing device
called a mouse.

09:24.065 --> 09:25.650
I don't know why we call it a mouse.

09:25.816 --> 09:30.196
<i>By 1968, Stanford's
Doug Engelbart, inventor of the mouse,</i>

09:30.321 --> 09:31.864
<i>was asking new questions</i>

09:31.989 --> 09:36.244
<i>about the essential nature of our
changing relationship with computers.</i>

09:36.369 --> 09:39.997
If in your office,
you as an intellectual worker

09:40.122 --> 09:42.959
were supplied with a computer display

09:43.084 --> 09:47.213
backed up by a computer
that was alive for you all day

09:47.338 --> 09:51.592
and was instantly responsible,
responsive,

09:51.717 --> 09:53.928
instantly responsive
to every action you had,

09:54.095 --> 09:56.055
how much value
could you derive from that?

09:56.222 --> 10:00.184
<i>We needed a guide to help us
navigate this new relationship.</i>

10:03.229 --> 10:08.276
<i>My whole adult life has been spent
building personal computers.</i>

10:08.401 --> 10:13.447
<i>So, the history of my vocation
and my avocations</i>

10:13.572 --> 10:16.909
<i>and, you know,
my growing up are all the same,</i>

10:17.076 --> 10:19.745
and it's very hard
to separate one from the other.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.882
<i>I come from a place called
Silicon Valley, California,</i>

10:32.008 --> 10:35.011
<i>and you'll find there are
a lot of electronics kits around.</i>

10:35.136 --> 10:39.056
<i>My electronics teacher realized
that I had a lot of computer ability</i>

10:39.181 --> 10:41.559
<i>that went beyond anything he could
possibly teach me in school.</i>

10:41.684 --> 10:45.229
He knew that as long as I was in class,
I was just going to sit around,

10:45.354 --> 10:47.189
playing pranks on the other students

10:47.398 --> 10:49.775
like wrapping little hair wires
around certain circuits

10:49.900 --> 10:52.153
so when they plugged in their radio,
it would blow up.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.827
<i>As hard as I think about it,</i>

10:59.994 --> 11:02.413
<i>I don't think I ever had one friend
who was not one of the tech kids.</i>

11:03.956 --> 11:07.460
<i>I met Woz when I was maybe
12 years old, 13 years old.</i>

11:07.585 --> 11:10.296
<i>He was the first person I met
that knew more electronics than I did.</i>

11:10.421 --> 11:14.759
And one of the things that Woz and I did
was we built blue boxes.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.973
<i>One day
I picked up a magazine,</i>

11:21.098 --> 11:25.353
and I started reading a story
about phone phreaks and blue boxes.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.565
<i>When phone phreaks
have a convention,</i>

11:29.690 --> 11:33.444
<i>as they did in the ballroom
of a seedy New York hotel lately,</i>

11:33.569 --> 11:38.199
<i>masks are given out at the door.
People don't give their right names.</i>

11:38.366 --> 11:43.287
The blue box was a little device that
put special tones into anybody's phone

11:43.412 --> 11:46.707
and those tones would connect you
anywhere you wanted.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.627
<i>Halfway through reading this,
I called Steve Jobs over</i>

11:49.794 --> 11:52.755
<i>and started reading it to him
over the phone.</i>

11:52.963 --> 11:55.841
There's a way to fool
the entire telephone system

11:56.008 --> 11:58.177
into thinking you were
a telephone computer

11:58.302 --> 12:01.305
and to open up itself and let you call
anywhere in the world for free.

12:01.430 --> 12:05.142
<i>You could call from a pay phone,
go to White Plains, New York,</i>

12:05.267 --> 12:06.769
<i>take a satellite to Europe.</i>

12:06.894 --> 12:09.480
<i>And you'd go around the world
and call the pay phone next door.</i>

12:09.647 --> 12:11.732
<i>Shout in the phone,
be about 30 seconds,</i>

12:11.857 --> 12:13.609
<i>it'd come out the other end
of the other phone.</i>

12:13.776 --> 12:17.530
And he's like, "Hello,"
There's a lag and, "Hello, how are you?"

12:17.655 --> 12:19.365
"I'm fine." You know?

12:19.490 --> 12:22.910
<i>Why, one might wonder,
would someone want to do that?</i>

12:23.077 --> 12:25.371
<i>To rip off the phone company.</i>

12:25.496 --> 12:27.665
And these were illegal, I have to add.

12:29.917 --> 12:33.504
<i>In college, I had a blue box
of my own. It was important</i>

12:33.629 --> 12:37.216
<i>because long-distance phone calls
were really expensive back then.</i>

12:38.634 --> 12:41.846
<i>It was also a way
of sticking it to the man.</i>

12:42.096 --> 12:45.724
<i>This would become an important
selling point for Jobs, too,</i>

12:45.850 --> 12:49.562
<i>even as he left
the technical work to others.</i>

12:49.687 --> 12:51.647
<i>Well, I had this blue box design.</i>

12:51.772 --> 12:54.066
<i>I did a trick in there
that I've never done that good a trick</i>

12:54.191 --> 12:55.651
<i>in any other design in my life.</i>

12:55.776 --> 12:59.738
<i>And Steve Jobs said,
"Hey, why don't we sell them?"</i>

12:59.864 --> 13:02.241
<i>You know, you rapidly run
out of people you want to call,</i>

13:02.366 --> 13:05.453
<i>but it was the magic that two teenagers</i>

13:05.578 --> 13:08.289
<i>could build this box
for $100 worth of parts</i>

13:08.414 --> 13:13.544
<i>and control hundreds of billions
of dollars of infrastructure</i>

13:13.669 --> 13:16.505
<i>in the entire telephone network
in the whole world.</i>

13:17.840 --> 13:22.761
We could sort of influence the world,
you know?

13:22.887 --> 13:24.555
Control it, in the case of blue boxes,

13:24.722 --> 13:27.141
but something much more powerful
than controlling.

13:27.266 --> 13:32.229
Influencing, in the case of Apple.
And they're very closely related.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.814
I really do, to this day,

13:33.939 --> 13:37.151
feel that if we hadn't had had
those blue box experiences,

13:37.359 --> 13:39.653
there never would have been
an Apple computer.

13:39.778 --> 13:41.947
<i>I think Jobs
was always a storyteller.</i>

13:42.114 --> 13:45.951
There was always this sense
that he was constructing a persona.

13:47.328 --> 13:50.080
<i>The first time I sat down
with him to work on a story,</i>

13:50.206 --> 13:52.333
he immediately asked me
if I had read

13:52.458 --> 13:57.588
<i>Thomas Kuhn's "The Structure
of Scientific Revolutions."</i>

13:57.713 --> 14:00.466
<i>I think he was assimilating
into this personality,</i>

14:00.591 --> 14:02.927
<i>this notion that he had found in Kuhn.</i>

14:03.093 --> 14:06.222
<i>The random result
that eventually creates</i>

14:06.347 --> 14:08.974
a paradigm shift where everybody
one morning wakes up,

14:09.141 --> 14:10.893
and they think the new way.

14:11.018 --> 14:15.147
<i>And I believe that he thought
that he was a paradigm shifter.</i>

14:15.272 --> 14:19.235
<i>That was part of his story. He wanted
to have a foot in both worlds.</i>

14:19.360 --> 14:22.947
<i>He wanted to be the renegade,
but he also wanted to be legit.</i>

14:24.990 --> 14:29.662
<i>This is the video deposition
of Steven P Jobs.</i>

14:29.787 --> 14:33.749
We are on the record at 9:22am.

14:33.874 --> 14:38.254
Can we just sort of briefly go over
your employment history after 1973?

14:39.880 --> 14:45.553
I was employed by Atari,
a maker of video games.

14:47.388 --> 14:51.767
- What time frame?
- I don't know. Early '70s.

15:04.280 --> 15:08.367
Creativity is a lot about anarchy.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.414
<i>I had been in the video-game
business two years</i>

15:13.539 --> 15:18.544
and our corporate culture
was really "work hard, play hard."

15:18.669 --> 15:20.754
<i>The true original sin of Apple</i>

15:20.879 --> 15:23.757
literally takes place
before the company is founded.

15:23.882 --> 15:27.469
<i>Jobs had left Reed College
and now he was back in Silicon Valley.</i>

15:27.595 --> 15:29.680
<i>Woz was working at HP.</i>

15:29.805 --> 15:31.223
<i>I was such a nerd.</i>

15:31.348 --> 15:34.351
<i>When I finished designing calculators
at Hewlett-Packard in the daytime,</i>

15:34.476 --> 15:36.186
<i>I would work on my own little projects.</i>

15:36.312 --> 15:38.522
<i>I saw "Pong" in a bowling alley,
and I said,</i>

15:38.647 --> 15:41.609
<i>"I know logic design,
and I know electronics of televisions."</i>

15:41.734 --> 15:46.780
<i>"I'll use my home TV, snake a wire in,"
and I built myself a "Pong."</i>

15:46.905 --> 15:48.616
Steve came back from Reed College

15:48.741 --> 15:51.327
and saw that I had built
my own <i>Pong</i> game.

15:51.452 --> 15:54.246
<i>And so that gave him the idea
to go down to Atari.</i>

15:54.371 --> 15:56.749
<i>And he went down,
and he showed them the board</i>

15:56.915 --> 15:58.459
<i>and he wound up with a job.</i>

15:58.584 --> 16:01.754
Steve came in and said,
in typical Steve Jobs fashion,

16:01.879 --> 16:03.714
"I'm not going to leave
until you hire me."

16:03.839 --> 16:10.512
<i>And I really appreciated his intensity.
He had one speed. Full on.</i>

16:10.638 --> 16:13.974
<i>I had one little project
that everyone kept turning down.</i>

16:14.099 --> 16:15.809
<i>It was a project called "Breakout."</i>

16:15.934 --> 16:19.021
<i>And finally I said,
"Steve, hey, do this for me."</i>

16:19.146 --> 16:20.439
In the back of my mind,

16:20.564 --> 16:26.487
I knew that Woz was coming over all
the time after working at HP all day,

16:26.612 --> 16:30.240
and I thought,
"OK, I'll put Steve on the night shift."

16:30.449 --> 16:33.494
"Woz will come over. I'll get
two Steves for the price of one."

16:33.619 --> 16:37.414
<i>Steve said, "Nolan Bushnell
of Atari wants another game built."</i>

16:37.539 --> 16:39.500
<i>But we only had four days, Steve said.</i>

16:39.625 --> 16:42.461
<i>When a game is made out of chips
and it's not a program,</i>

16:42.586 --> 16:45.756
<i>four days is, like, impossible.
This is months' worth of work.</i>

16:47.758 --> 16:48.801
<i>I did the entire design,</i>

16:48.926 --> 16:51.553
<i>and then Steve would breadboard
my design for a little while.</i>

16:52.554 --> 16:56.975
<i>We were up four days and nights
non-stop. Both got mononucleosis.</i>

16:57.101 --> 17:00.020
<i>And we got "Breakout" delivered
to Atari, and they paid for it.</i>

17:04.608 --> 17:07.653
<i>Later on,
Woz and I were out to dinner.</i>

17:07.778 --> 17:10.155
He was talking about <i>Breakout,</i>

17:10.321 --> 17:13.534
and I said, "Well, you know,
you guys got paid pretty well for it."

17:13.659 --> 17:16.286
He looked at me puzzled, and I said,

17:16.412 --> 17:19.580
"Yeah, I mean,
you did such a good job."

17:19.707 --> 17:24.795
"I think there was at least
a $5,000 bonus that you guys got."

17:24.920 --> 17:28.799
So, yeah, he was paid $7,000,
and he told me that we were paid $700,

17:28.924 --> 17:30.926
and he wrote me a check for $350.

17:32.136 --> 17:34.221
<i>You know, and that hurts
because we were friends.</i>

17:34.388 --> 17:36.557
<i>And do you do that to a friend?</i>

17:36.682 --> 17:39.768
<i>If he'd said, "I need the money,"
I would have said, "Take it all."</i>

17:39.893 --> 17:42.521
<i>I was happy to be on the project.</i>

17:42.646 --> 17:45.232
I think that Steve...

17:47.317 --> 17:50.362
was very driven

17:50.487 --> 17:57.286
and would very often take
shortcuts to achieve his goals.

18:02.458 --> 18:06.420
# Then in time we'll tell who has fell

18:06.545 --> 18:09.548
<i># And who's been left behind</i>

18:09.673 --> 18:12.926
<i># When you go your way
And I go mine</i>

18:15.929 --> 18:19.099
<i>Apple was a sitcom.
It was a 30-year sitcom.</i>

18:19.224 --> 18:21.685
And Steve was the main character.

18:25.189 --> 18:28.400
<i>This was written in December 1976.</i>

18:28.525 --> 18:32.738
In fact it starts out saying,
"Who's Apple," so that was very early.

18:35.282 --> 18:39.244
<i>He and Woz came in.
Steve had long hair down his back.</i>

18:39.411 --> 18:44.374
<i>He had a Ho Chi Minh beard,
cutoffs, Birkenstocks.</i>

18:44.500 --> 18:48.378
And Wozniak was maybe a little bit
upscale from that, but not much.

18:48.504 --> 18:50.631
I used to like Intel's advertising,

18:50.756 --> 18:53.759
So I called them up one day,
and I said, "Who does your advertising?"

18:53.884 --> 18:56.804
They said, "Well, Regis McKenna."
"What's a Regis McKenna?"

18:56.929 --> 18:58.764
They said, "No, it's a person."

18:58.889 --> 19:02.684
<i>Wozniak had a technical article
on the Apple II.</i>

19:02.810 --> 19:05.771
<i>He wanted us to try to get it
placed into a magazine.</i>

19:05.896 --> 19:10.275
Nobody could read it. It was
all technical jargon and so forth.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.361
<i>And so I told him
I'd have to rewrite it,</i>

19:12.486 --> 19:14.530
<i>and he wasn't happy about that.</i>

19:14.655 --> 19:16.782
He said, "No one's going to rewrite
my stuff."

19:16.907 --> 19:18.867
I said, "Well,
then there's nothing I can do for you",

19:18.992 --> 19:20.118
so you might as well leave."

19:20.285 --> 19:23.539
<i>Steve called back,
and he pretty much convinced me</i>

19:23.664 --> 19:25.791
<i>that he would be the person
that we'd be dealing with</i>

19:25.916 --> 19:28.877
and that Wozniak would be designing
and building things,

19:29.002 --> 19:30.879
which is the way it happens
in most businesses.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.714
The engineers are more back room

19:32.923 --> 19:36.677
and you work with either the
entrepreneur or the marketing people.

19:38.095 --> 19:40.472
<i>Did you think early on
that Steve could be the guy?</i>

19:40.597 --> 19:44.268
Oh, definitely. You just had to spend
a few minutes with him and you knew it.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.811
<i>He had the ability</i>

19:45.936 --> 19:49.857
<i>to talk about the possibility
of what this computer could be.</i>

19:49.982 --> 19:53.819
And I think the key is not just
talking about the product,

19:53.944 --> 19:59.032
but giving you an idea
of what is possible using this product

19:59.157 --> 20:02.244
and what the next generation
is going to be like.

20:02.369 --> 20:06.206
So he gives people this feeling
of forward movement.

20:06.331 --> 20:09.126
- How many calculators do you own?
- Two, maybe.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.962
Right, and do you use
the automatic bank-telling machines?

20:12.087 --> 20:14.381
- Sure.
- Life is already seducing you

20:14.631 --> 20:17.759
into learning this stuff.
It's not going to happen at once,

20:17.885 --> 20:21.305
and it's certainly not
a <i>1984-ish</i> vision at all.

20:21.471 --> 20:24.182
It's just going to be very gradual
and very human

20:24.308 --> 20:26.810
and will seduce you
into learning how to use it.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.982
<i>Transitioning from a hobby
to a personal computer,</i>

20:32.107 --> 20:34.776
<i>that whole idea was driven by Steve.</i>

20:34.902 --> 20:37.112
He was trying to say
we need to differentiate ourselves

20:37.237 --> 20:38.906
and really move out
of this hobbyist realm.

20:39.031 --> 20:41.909
<i>It ended up
coming out of the room saying,</i>

20:42.034 --> 20:44.828
<i>"We're going to call ourselves
the personal computer."</i>

20:44.953 --> 20:46.580
<i>Industry experts say</i>

20:46.705 --> 20:49.833
<i>we're no longer on the verge
of the personal computer revolution.</i>

20:50.000 --> 20:51.543
<i>We're right in the midst of it,
thank you.</i>

20:51.668 --> 20:52.878
And it's gathering steam

20:53.003 --> 20:56.256
with more and more people
jumping aboard every day.

20:56.381 --> 21:00.052
I use my computer right now
for mostly word processing.

21:00.177 --> 21:03.889
I use it for solar evaluation programs.

21:04.014 --> 21:06.141
We put our entire accounting system
on it.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.060
The wife can use it to store recipes.

21:08.185 --> 21:09.603
To balance my checkbook for me.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.396
We do the computer club's bulletin.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.148
- Playing games.
- Shopping by mail.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.567
- Budgeting.
- Bowling-league type scores.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.153
- Electronic mail.
- A guy can be creative on it.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.530
I mean, he can use it
for whatever he can dream up.

21:20.656 --> 21:22.616
This is a 21st-century bicycle

21:22.741 --> 21:26.620
that amplifies a certain intellectual
ability that man has.

21:26.745 --> 21:29.581
The effects that it's going to
have on society

21:29.706 --> 21:31.291
are actually going to far outstrip

21:31.416 --> 21:34.044
even those that the petrochemical
revolution has had.

21:34.169 --> 21:35.170
<i>Time</i> magazine, I think,

21:35.295 --> 21:39.675
said single-handedly he created
the industry because he was relentless.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.596
<i>The powers that be
of "Time" magazine</i>

21:44.721 --> 21:50.185
decided that they would make
the Man of the Year that particular year

21:50.310 --> 21:52.562
the Computer of the Year.

21:52.688 --> 21:56.066
<i>I was transferred to the bureau
in San Francisco.</i>

21:56.191 --> 21:59.361
And gradually I began to cotton on
to the fact

21:59.486 --> 22:04.032
that there were a lot of stories
in this part of California

22:04.157 --> 22:08.203
between San Jose
and San Francisco

22:08.328 --> 22:09.955
about these odd, little companies

22:10.080 --> 22:13.083
that people on the East Coast
at that point

22:13.208 --> 22:16.670
hadn't heard about
and really didn't care about.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.880
<i>And then I got very interested in Apple</i>

22:19.006 --> 22:23.719
<i>and Steve was,
of the early characters in the company,</i>

22:23.927 --> 22:28.974
the most articulate and the most
interesting and the oddest.

22:29.099 --> 22:33.020
<i>Steven Jobs helped build
the first Apple computer in his garage.</i>

22:33.145 --> 22:36.189
<i>He is now 26 years old
and is chairman of the board.</i>

22:37.315 --> 22:38.734
<i>There was some debate</i>

22:38.859 --> 22:40.986
<i>over whether or not
they should use the name "Apple."</i>

22:41.111 --> 22:43.947
<i>You know, the whole model
of the computer industry</i>

22:44.072 --> 22:45.741
and the computer business was IBM.

22:45.866 --> 22:50.662
<i>Another business service of
tomorrow made possible today by IBM.</i>

22:50.787 --> 22:53.415
IBM was an anonymous organization.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.710
No one knew who the president was.
They probably had no idea.

22:56.835 --> 23:02.007
<i>The IBM logo looked like it was
carved out of Roman marble, you know?</i>

23:02.132 --> 23:04.843
It was just
this monolithic kind of thing.

23:04.968 --> 23:07.846
<i>And we took just the opposite,
which was,</i>

23:07.971 --> 23:11.266
<i>"Let's make Steve very high profile.
Let's tell our story."</i>

23:11.391 --> 23:14.227
<i>Working in this garage,
Jobs and a high-school classmate</i>

23:14.352 --> 23:16.688
<i>quit their positions
at large electronic companies,</i>

23:16.813 --> 23:21.443
<i>and using tiny silicon chips,
built this small computer board.</i>

23:26.782 --> 23:31.411
<i>Funny, the garage story was
less of a feature in those early days.</i>

23:31.578 --> 23:34.122
<i>It later on became more of a look back</i>

23:34.247 --> 23:39.044
<i>when people started doing stories
on the background, and so forth.</i>

23:39.169 --> 23:45.175
You know, I told Steve this,
and most of my clients in fact,

23:45.300 --> 23:49.179
there's a song in <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>
that Tevye sings.

23:49.304 --> 23:53.683
He says, "If I were a rich man."
And he said, "I'd sit in the temple,

23:53.809 --> 23:56.895
and I'd lecture to the wise men
all day long,

23:57.020 --> 23:58.980
"and it wouldn't matter
if you're right or wrong."

23:59.106 --> 24:00.774
"When you're rich,
they think you know."

24:00.899 --> 24:02.526
So, in a technology business,

24:02.692 --> 24:06.530
you have to show that you are successful
in order to have a platform.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.241
<i>It led to
a quarter-billion-dollar business</i>

24:09.366 --> 24:13.328
<i>and the most popular typewriter-sized
computer on the market today.</i>

24:13.453 --> 24:16.248
Steve Jobs,
I realize this is your baby,

24:16.414 --> 24:17.958
and you've made a career out of it,

24:18.083 --> 24:20.544
but you're also
something of a philosopher.

24:20.710 --> 24:24.798
Do you see the inherent possibility
of bad coming out of all of this?

24:24.923 --> 24:27.259
Well, I think one of the things
you really have to look at

24:27.384 --> 24:30.095
is you have to go watch
some kids using these things.

24:30.220 --> 24:33.390
<i>And what you find is far
from something quite harmful.</i>

24:33.515 --> 24:35.016
<i>In effect, what you see</i>

24:35.183 --> 24:38.979
<i>is an instantaneous reflection
of a part of themselves,</i>

24:39.104 --> 24:41.565
the creative part of themselves
being expressed.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.992
<i>He was going for a computer</i>

24:52.117 --> 24:56.246
<i>that really felt like
an extension of the self.</i>

24:56.371 --> 25:00.292
That's what people wanted, and I think
he sensed that. He knew that.

25:01.418 --> 25:05.839
<i>My first book on the computer culture
was called "The Second Self."</i>

25:05.964 --> 25:07.924
<i>The key quote
that gave me the title was,</i>

25:08.049 --> 25:10.635
"When you think of a computer,"

25:10.802 --> 25:14.848
you put a little piece of your mind
into the computer's mind,

25:14.973 --> 25:17.267
"and you come to think
of yourself differently."

25:17.392 --> 25:23.023
Our whole company,
our whole philosophical base,

25:23.190 --> 25:27.277
is founded on one principle.
And that one principle

25:27.402 --> 25:32.282
is that there's something very special
and very historically different

25:32.407 --> 25:36.870
that takes place when you have
one computer and one person.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.707
<i>Did you have an opportunity
to meet Jobs?</i>

25:40.916 --> 25:43.168
<i>Yes,
I met him on several occasions.</i>

25:43.293 --> 25:45.295
And did you sense
from talking to him

25:45.420 --> 25:47.505
that he really did understand
what he was doing?

25:47.631 --> 25:49.799
I think he understood what he was doing.

25:51.009 --> 25:54.304
<i>He knew
he had created something intimate</i>

25:54.512 --> 25:57.515
<i>and that could be sold
as something intimate.</i>

25:57.641 --> 26:00.227
And it would be you.
I mean, it would be for you.

26:00.352 --> 26:04.481
It wasn't just for you. It was you.

26:10.487 --> 26:12.739
Can you just show me
the front of it?

26:12.906 --> 26:15.700
That's the part
that most people would recognize.

26:15.825 --> 26:19.579
This is a piece that everybody
remembers from the ads,

26:19.704 --> 26:23.333
from the <i>Time</i> magazine cover
with Steve holding it in his lap.

26:26.169 --> 26:29.422
And this is the famous beige that
we're never going to have any more of.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.216
He hated this even at this time,

26:31.341 --> 26:34.719
but we were kind of stuck with it
by the time we got there.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.183
It was a fun little machine.

26:44.604 --> 26:48.191
<i>He called me just out of the blue.
I was working atXerox.</i>

26:49.359 --> 26:52.320
And I picked up the phone,
and it was Steve Jobs.

26:52.445 --> 26:55.949
And he said, "I hear you're a good guy",

26:56.074 --> 26:59.494
but everything you've done so far
is crap. Come work for me."

27:00.870 --> 27:05.125
<i>I told my wife at the time.
I said, "Well, what could happen?"</i>

27:05.250 --> 27:06.918
<i>"How bad could this be?"</i>

27:09.129 --> 27:11.381
I didn't realize how bad it could be.

27:15.093 --> 27:17.262
<i>First trip Steve ever made to Japan</i>

27:17.387 --> 27:20.432
<i>was to see what we could do about
getting a disc drive for the machine.</i>

27:20.557 --> 27:25.520
<i>And we saw the Sony disc facility
in Atsugi, Japan.</i>

27:25.645 --> 27:30.817
He had a lot of affection for Sony
because the Walkman was a machine

27:30.984 --> 27:33.028
that he just thought
was the bee's knees.

27:33.153 --> 27:36.072
# You really feel the music
with a Sony Walkman

27:36.197 --> 27:39.576
<i>The Sony Walkman is
a tiny stereo cassette player</i>

27:39.743 --> 27:42.162
<i>with truly incredible sound.</i>

27:42.287 --> 27:44.748
<i># You really feel the music
You really feel it</i>

27:44.956 --> 27:47.375
I think it was the first product
in human history

27:47.500 --> 27:50.754
that went over a billion units.
That he liked.

27:51.796 --> 27:54.341
One of things that Steve thought
was important,

27:54.466 --> 27:56.134
and Jerry Manock facilitated it,

27:56.259 --> 27:58.678
was this is
where all the signatures are.

27:58.803 --> 28:02.307
And they're all the people,
the original group,

28:02.432 --> 28:08.980
that actually signed the machine.
There's Steve Jobs right in the middle.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.941
My name is over here.

28:12.108 --> 28:13.610
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

28:13.735 --> 28:17.572
Because the people that worked
on it consider themselves,

28:17.697 --> 28:20.158
and I certainly consider them, artists.

28:20.283 --> 28:22.660
These are the people that
under different circumstances

28:22.786 --> 28:26.998
<i>would be painters and poets, but,
because of the time that we live in,</i>

28:27.123 --> 28:29.250
<i>this new medium has appeared</i>

28:29.376 --> 28:32.545
<i>in which to express oneself
to one's fellow species.</i>

28:32.670 --> 28:36.049
And that's a medium of computing.

28:41.596 --> 28:45.225
<i>We would sit
in the temples in Kyoto,</i>

28:45.350 --> 28:49.729
<i>just taking off our shoes at the door
and sitting.</i>

29:03.660 --> 29:07.330
<i>Did he take from that any
kind of aesthetic vision, do you think?</i>

29:07.455 --> 29:11.584
<i>I think certainly.
A simplicity.</i>

29:13.086 --> 29:16.047
Just feeling that inner calm

29:16.172 --> 29:20.301
that's so available
at some places in Japan.

29:22.387 --> 29:25.932
<i>He was a very much a person
who was comfortable in silence.</i>

29:36.067 --> 29:40.780
Steve ruled by a kind of a chaos.
And it's easy to make chaos,

29:40.905 --> 29:44.826
and if you're comfortable with it,
you can use it as a tool.

29:44.951 --> 29:48.121
<i>And he used a vast number
of really irritating tools</i>

29:48.246 --> 29:52.625
to get other people involved
in his schemes.

29:52.750 --> 29:59.757
<i>He's seducing you, he's vilifying you
and he's ignoring you.</i>

29:59.883 --> 30:01.593
You're in one of those three states.

30:03.928 --> 30:07.974
<i>When you get a core group of,
you know, ten great people,</i>

30:08.141 --> 30:12.604
<i>it becomes self-policing
as to who they let into that group.</i>

30:12.729 --> 30:18.151
So, I consider the most important job
of someone like myself is recruiting.

30:18.359 --> 30:21.863
<i>Steve Jobs brought us all together
in a place that had no rules.</i>

30:21.988 --> 30:26.451
He's a maniac. He's a maniacal genius.
His job is to stir up everything.

30:26.576 --> 30:29.913
<i>Most places in life
are continuously telling you</i>

30:30.079 --> 30:32.290
<i>that your dreams aren't possible
or practical.</i>

30:32.415 --> 30:34.459
You don't want to hear that
when you're under 30.

30:34.584 --> 30:36.252
What you want to do is race after them.

30:36.377 --> 30:37.879
You ask yourself, why are you doing it?

30:38.087 --> 30:39.881
I'm certainly not doing it
for Steve Jobs.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.592
I'm doing it for what I think is
a much greater good than that.

30:42.717 --> 30:45.970
Everybody just wanted to work, not
because it was work that had to be done,

30:46.137 --> 30:48.515
but it was because it was something
that we really believed in.

30:48.640 --> 30:54.145
Here is how we see personal computers.
Here is how we want the world to be.

30:54.270 --> 30:56.773
And here's how we're going to change it.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.483
We have a vision
of what we want it to be.

30:58.608 --> 31:00.985
We want to convert people.
We want to make converts.

31:01.152 --> 31:04.155
<i>I felt my job at Macintosh</i>

31:04.280 --> 31:07.742
<i>was to make the division
work smoothly enough</i>

31:07.867 --> 31:11.704
<i>that we could actually get this thing
from really a mess of kids</i>

31:11.829 --> 31:14.541
<i>playing around with a bunch
of hardware and software</i>

31:14.666 --> 31:17.335
<i>into something that would be
a commercial product.</i>

31:17.460 --> 31:20.129
And that's what I did.
I got that machine finished.

31:29.013 --> 31:32.517
<i>It is now 1984.</i>

31:32.642 --> 31:35.478
IBM became the apparent visible threat.

31:35.603 --> 31:38.565
IBM wants it all,
and is aiming its guns

31:38.690 --> 31:43.027
on its last obstacle
to industry control. Apple.

31:43.152 --> 31:46.489
Will Big Blue dominate
the entire computer industry?

31:46.614 --> 31:50.451
The entire information age?
Was George Orwell right?

31:51.619 --> 31:55.456
<i>Today, we celebrate
the first glorious anniversary</i>

31:55.582 --> 31:58.459
<i>over the information
purification directives.</i>

31:58.585 --> 32:01.546
<i>That ad was again
a juxtaposition with IBM.</i>

32:01.671 --> 32:03.631
<i>- That's what it was about.
- Yeah.</i>

32:03.756 --> 32:06.217
<i>The people in the audience
were mindless IBM users.</i>

32:06.342 --> 32:08.219
<i>Yes. You know,
for Steve it was great</i>

32:08.344 --> 32:12.599
because he had this bad guy/good guy,
and he loved playing that role.

32:12.724 --> 32:16.644
<i>We shall prevail!</i>

32:37.248 --> 32:38.875
<i>Looking back,
behind the scenes,</i>

32:39.083 --> 32:42.503
<i>it's easy to see the irony in the ad.</i>

32:42.629 --> 32:44.547
<i>Today, Apple is Goliath.</i>

32:44.672 --> 32:46.132
Rolling. Rolling.

32:46.341 --> 32:48.217
<i>But even in 1984,</i>

32:48.384 --> 32:51.137
<i>when Apple cast itself
as the counterculture company,</i>

32:51.304 --> 32:54.766
<i>working at Apple was a lot tougher
than IBM.</i>

32:56.851 --> 32:59.020
<i>I think if you talk to a lot of
people on the Mac team,</i>

32:59.145 --> 33:05.151
they will tell you it was the hardest
they've ever worked in their life.

33:05.318 --> 33:07.028
Some of them will tell you
it was, you know,

33:07.278 --> 33:08.988
the happiest they've ever been
in their life,

33:09.113 --> 33:11.032
but I think all of them will tell you

33:11.157 --> 33:14.494
that it is certainly one of the most
intense and cherished experiences

33:14.619 --> 33:15.995
they will ever have in their life.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.956
Mm-hmm. Yeah, they did.
- So...

33:21.751 --> 33:23.753
You know...

33:25.421 --> 33:29.967
Some of those things are
not sustainable for some people.

33:35.765 --> 33:38.351
<i>I ended up
changing my entire life.</i>

33:38.559 --> 33:40.770
I lost my wife in that process.

33:40.895 --> 33:44.565
I lost my children in that process.
I lost...

33:44.732 --> 33:48.444
The whole structure of my life
was just changed forever

33:48.569 --> 33:52.573
by going and working on the Mac.

33:52.699 --> 33:54.784
Because the work
became so intense?

33:54.909 --> 33:56.369
The work was intense.

33:56.494 --> 33:58.538
The commitment needed to do it
was intense.

33:58.663 --> 34:01.666
<i>I would go into work
on a Tuesday morning</i>

34:01.791 --> 34:03.668
<i>and half the people would hate me,</i>

34:03.793 --> 34:05.420
<i>and I'd come back on Wednesday morning,</i>

34:05.586 --> 34:08.172
<i>and half the people would hate me,
but it was the other half.</i>

34:08.339 --> 34:10.757
<i>There were an awful lot
of prima Donnas in that outfit,</i>

34:10.882 --> 34:13.594
<i>so I was always in conflict.</i>

34:16.806 --> 34:20.518
Here's the piece you wrote.
You want to read it?

34:21.853 --> 34:26.399
"Steve's passing did come
as a bit of a shock for me."

34:26.524 --> 34:31.404
"For a bit more than three years,
1982 to 1985,

34:31.529 --> 34:34.239
we were together a lot of the time."

34:34.407 --> 34:38.494
"We made a dozen trips to Japan
together. We were close."

34:38.619 --> 34:41.664
"After that,
I only saw him a few times."

34:41.789 --> 34:44.167
"I haven't seen him in many years."

34:44.333 --> 34:48.670
"He was an extraordinary person in many
ways and quite normal in others."

34:48.795 --> 34:52.257
<i>"The outpouring of feelings
from people all over the world</i>

34:52.467 --> 34:57.138
<i>was a bit of a surprise to me at first,
and then it seemed natural."</i>

34:57.263 --> 35:00.057
<i>"He was for them
a combination of James Dean,</i>

35:00.183 --> 35:04.061
<i>Princess Diana and John Lennon
and maybe Santa Claus."</i>

35:04.187 --> 35:07.857
"What is in that bag of goodies?"

35:08.775 --> 35:12.653
<i>"The iPod, the iPhone
and the iPad are so personal."</i>

35:12.779 --> 35:17.784
<i>"They are warm in your hand.
They sing to you when you're alone."</i>

35:17.909 --> 35:19.368
<i>"They are caressed."</i>

35:21.871 --> 35:23.164
"In those three years together,

35:23.289 --> 35:26.250
I packed in a decade or two
of experience."

35:26.417 --> 35:31.798
"Steve packed in a couple of centuries
in his 56 years."

35:31.923 --> 35:36.469
"He did everything he wanted,
and all on his own terms."

35:36.594 --> 35:39.472
"It was a life well and fully lived,

35:39.597 --> 35:43.059
even if it was a bit expensive
for those of us who were close."

35:47.605 --> 35:50.066
You do have friends, you know?

35:50.191 --> 35:53.319
Even if they're bizarre people.

35:55.613 --> 35:58.491
Yes. He is.
He's one of those mythic characters.

35:58.616 --> 36:05.665
Yeah, and they're not that much fun
on the ground most of the time,

36:05.790 --> 36:09.335
but there are those moments
when suddenly...

36:11.087 --> 36:13.714
They're the only person
who could've ever done it.

36:13.923 --> 36:15.299
Right.

36:15.466 --> 36:19.095
- Yeah, and they change us.
- Right.

36:32.441 --> 36:35.778
<i>Without death,
there would be very little progress.</i>

36:35.903 --> 36:39.323
<i>I'm sure that life evolved
without death at first</i>

36:39.490 --> 36:44.829
<i>and found that without death,
life didn't work very well.</i>

36:44.954 --> 36:48.332
<i>Because it didn't make room
for the young</i>

36:48.499 --> 36:52.920
<i>who didn't know how the world was,
you know, 50 years ago,</i>

36:53.045 --> 36:56.757
<i>but who saw it as it is today
without any preconceptions</i>

36:56.883 --> 36:59.260
<i>and dreamed how it could be
based on that.</i>

37:04.098 --> 37:07.184
<i>The minute that you understand
that you can poke life,</i>

37:07.310 --> 37:09.145
<i>you can change it, you can mold it,</i>

37:09.270 --> 37:11.898
<i>you'll want to change life
and make it better</i>

37:12.023 --> 37:14.025
<i>cos it's kind of messed up
in a lot of ways.</i>

37:15.151 --> 37:18.237
<i>Once you learn that,
you'll never be the same again.</i>

37:23.784 --> 37:24.994
<i>Just be here.</i>

37:25.995 --> 37:30.958
<i>Donâ€™t judge, don't try,
don't stop, don't start. Just be here.</i>

37:31.083 --> 37:32.710
<i>It's all just enough.</i>

37:36.631 --> 37:39.008
<i>It's enough to know that I love you.</i>

37:42.678 --> 37:47.308
<i>Steve and I met two weeks into
our freshman year at Reed College.</i>

37:47.433 --> 37:51.646
<i>We had both happened to buy
"Be Here Now."</i>

37:51.812 --> 37:55.733
And it was such an unusual book.
I just wanted...

37:55.858 --> 37:58.986
I was carrying it around
and wanted somebody to talk to about it,

37:59.111 --> 38:02.365
and Steve was the one person
who also had read it.

38:09.830 --> 38:11.290
<i>When we went to India,</i>

38:11.415 --> 38:15.920
<i>we were looking for
remarkable experiences.</i>

38:16.045 --> 38:19.590
<i>We didn't have a guru.
We didn't have a particular school.</i>

38:19.715 --> 38:22.843
<i>And so we traveled around
for four months.</i>

38:22.969 --> 38:29.934
<i>Had some interesting experiences.
No major enlightenment experiences.</i>

38:30.059 --> 38:32.436
Steve's quote later was,

38:32.603 --> 38:35.106
"We had figured out that
we weren't going to meet somebody

38:35.231 --> 38:37.441
who was going to make us enlightened."

38:40.194 --> 38:42.405
<i>If you think about Hindu spirituality,</i>

38:42.571 --> 38:46.450
<i>you think of Mother Teresa
feeding the poor.</i>

38:46.617 --> 38:49.954
<i>That's not really the path
that Steve took.</i>

38:50.079 --> 38:52.748
Those weren't Steve's values.

38:55.710 --> 38:57.837
<i>It was the next year,
after India,</i>

38:57.962 --> 39:02.008
<i>when he connected
with the Zen Center in Los Altos.</i>

39:02.133 --> 39:08.597
<i>Zen is about clarity,
simplicity, cleanliness.</i>

39:09.473 --> 39:15.271
<i>Ending the duality of your ego
and simplifying your life.</i>

39:15.396 --> 39:18.482
<i>And that really appealed to Steve.</i>

39:18.649 --> 39:23.320
It's based on taking off
and creating something for yourself.

39:23.446 --> 39:27.450
You know, giving life to your own life
in whatever way you wish to do it.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.995
<i>At the time
he was starting Apple,</i>

39:31.120 --> 39:34.915
<i>Steve was very actively looking
for a mentor.</i>

39:39.420 --> 39:43.215
<i>Kobun Chino would
become Jobs's spiritual advisor.</i>

39:43.382 --> 39:47.720
<i>Kobun encouraged Jobs
not to retreat into a monastery,</i>

39:47.845 --> 39:51.557
<i>but instead to find Zen
in his life and work.</i>

39:51.766 --> 39:54.852
<i>But they would argue
over the path to enlightenment.</i>

40:08.115 --> 40:14.914
Steve always says, "Make me monk.
Please make me monk."

40:15.039 --> 40:18.334
I say, "Not until proof."

40:20.086 --> 40:26.050
When I was living in California,
23 years ago...

40:26.175 --> 40:27.968
Midnight...

40:28.094 --> 40:32.890
I answered the doorbell and there he is.

40:33.015 --> 40:36.060
18 years old, he was.

40:36.185 --> 40:39.438
And he wanted to see me.

40:40.481 --> 40:44.068
And I looked into his eyes, and...

40:44.193 --> 40:48.072
They looked terrible,
but he is not crazy.

40:48.197 --> 40:51.408
I must talk with him.

40:51.534 --> 40:57.039
I took him for a walk
through the downtown of Los Altos.

40:58.082 --> 41:00.209
All stores closed.

41:00.334 --> 41:06.298
One bar called The Teacup was open.

41:07.716 --> 41:10.845
We sat down at the counter.

41:12.471 --> 41:17.726
I had Irish coffee and he had juice.

41:18.978 --> 41:23.065
After sipping, he started to talk.

41:24.233 --> 41:29.446
He said, "I feel I'm enlightened."

41:29.572 --> 41:32.366
"I don't know what to do with this."

41:35.661 --> 41:41.125
That's wonderful.
That is very wonderful.

41:43.127 --> 41:45.796
I need proof of it.

41:50.050 --> 41:53.596
A week later he came back

41:53.888 --> 41:59.101
with a little metal sheet in his hand.

42:00.269 --> 42:03.939
Many things were going,
wires going around...

42:04.064 --> 42:06.692
I didn't know what it was.

42:07.318 --> 42:12.281
It was a chip of a personal computer.

42:14.033 --> 42:20.122
He said, "I designed it.
My friend Woz helped me."

42:21.290 --> 42:26.503
"This is called Lisa."

42:26.629 --> 42:28.589
"I named it Lisa."

42:29.632 --> 42:34.845
Which is the name of his daughter.

42:36.263 --> 42:40.434
That was the origin of Apple Computer.

42:42.353 --> 42:49.318
And I'm still not quite sure
that was a true proof or not.

42:49.443 --> 42:54.657
He's brilliant, but too smart, I think.

42:59.370 --> 43:03.916
When you broke the Lisa story,
why was that important?

43:04.041 --> 43:07.461
There was a computer called "Lisa."

43:07.586 --> 43:12.716
And everybody wondered
who the computer was named after.

43:14.551 --> 43:17.972
I didn't choose
to name the computer "Lisa."

43:18.973 --> 43:22.434
I was obviously curious
about why it was named "Lisa".

43:24.019 --> 43:26.855
Fair or unfair, I think that was,

43:26.981 --> 43:30.359
to me,
that was a germane part of the story.

43:38.909 --> 43:43.247
<i># With your mercury mouth</i>

43:43.372 --> 43:47.584
<i># In the missionary times</i>

43:47.710 --> 43:51.171
<i># And your eyes like smoke</i>

43:51.297 --> 43:53.966
<i>I was 17, sitting in the quad.</i>

43:54.091 --> 43:57.803
<i>Early spring,
warm and cold at the same time.</i>

43:57.970 --> 44:03.642
And I look over, and there's
this guy I have never seen.

44:03.767 --> 44:09.690
I've been there for three years.
I can't believe how gorgeous he is.

44:09.815 --> 44:16.155
<i>And he starts to walk out of the quad,
and I followed him</i>

44:16.280 --> 44:19.700
<i>cos I thought,
"I've got to introduce myself to him."</i>

44:20.826 --> 44:24.997
And I'm going, "What do I say?"
I had no idea what to say.

44:25.122 --> 44:28.334
<i>A few months later,
I was working on a film.</i>

44:28.459 --> 44:33.964
<i>We worked all night long,
and he walks up out of the dark.</i>

44:34.089 --> 44:38.635
He was confident and awkward.
He was a study in contrasts.

44:38.761 --> 44:44.808
And he had jeans on that drooped
because they had so many holes in them.

44:44.975 --> 44:48.270
And he was very intentional,
very intense.

44:48.395 --> 44:53.984
<i>And then he handed me a poem
by Bob Dylan.</i>

44:54.151 --> 44:56.445
<i>"Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands."</i>

44:59.073 --> 45:02.785
<i>He would re-write Dylan's songs
to fit his life.</i>

45:05.079 --> 45:09.500
And then he... he just scanned the quad

45:09.625 --> 45:13.504
and the darkness
that went over his face...

45:14.755 --> 45:21.678
The edge, the worry,
the dissonance, was shocking to me.

45:21.804 --> 45:25.557
And I was young enough where I thought,
"Did I say something wrong?"

45:25.682 --> 45:28.352
But later I realized
that wasn't what it was.

45:28.477 --> 45:30.479
That was part of who he was.

45:30.604 --> 45:33.273
And I mean, that was one of the things
that I was attracted to,

45:33.399 --> 45:36.276
is that he had a lot going on
inside him.

45:39.738 --> 45:43.826
Steve was a romantic,
and he really loved Chrisann.

45:43.992 --> 45:47.329
<i>I think she was
a seductive force in his life,</i>

45:47.454 --> 45:54.002
<i>and there was a part of Steve
that didn't want to push that away.</i>

45:54.128 --> 45:56.422
But the main thing in Steve's life,
number one,

45:56.547 --> 46:00.092
was getting Apple off the ground.

46:00.217 --> 46:03.679
<i>And he just really could not focus
on anything else.</i>

46:05.222 --> 46:08.267
<i>I came out in June of '77,</i>

46:08.392 --> 46:13.522
<i>and the three of us went
and rented a house in Cupertino.</i>

46:15.274 --> 46:19.403
<i>Apple is beginning.
Steve and I are falling in love again.</i>

46:19.528 --> 46:22.156
But we're going back and forth
big time now.

46:22.281 --> 46:26.618
It's just like I'm insecure
because he's so unkind,

46:26.743 --> 46:30.164
and then we connect.

46:32.541 --> 46:36.044
<i>But I don't know how to handle
how fast Steve's mind is</i>

46:36.170 --> 46:39.298
<i>and how fast
he throws negative stuff at me.</i>

46:39.465 --> 46:44.928
And by the time I figure out,
"I've got to get out of here..."

46:46.221 --> 46:48.432
Um...

46:48.557 --> 46:51.477
"This is not working."

46:51.602 --> 46:57.566
Um... "I don't want to be in their club,
Daniel's or just even with Steve."

46:57.691 --> 47:03.322
"It's just not working."
That's when I got pregnant.

47:04.865 --> 47:07.868
What happened when
you told Steve that you were pregnant?

47:09.369 --> 47:10.787
Um...

47:10.913 --> 47:13.582
I told Steve in the dining room.

47:13.832 --> 47:18.921
Steve's jaw clenched.

47:19.171 --> 47:22.925
And searing anger...

47:23.091 --> 47:26.136
And he runs out the door,
kind of like a teenager,

47:26.261 --> 47:27.804
slams the door.

47:39.024 --> 47:41.276
<i>She got pregnant.</i>

47:41.401 --> 47:46.490
And Steve just was, "Not... not...
not me."

47:46.615 --> 47:49.159
"It's not me. It's not me," right?

47:49.326 --> 47:53.956
Even though that was not
a reasonable thing to say.

47:55.958 --> 47:59.461
<i>After Lisa was born,
Steve came up three days later.</i>

47:59.586 --> 48:02.297
<i>And we're sitting in a field,
and he...</i>

48:02.422 --> 48:05.425
We're like, trying to negotiate...

48:07.469 --> 48:10.806
what name we both feel good about
for her.

48:10.931 --> 48:13.600
He knows he's the father.

48:15.185 --> 48:19.940
<i>He comes with the idea
of wanting to call her Claire,</i>

48:20.065 --> 48:23.777
<i>and I don't want Claire because
it's too much like Clara,</i>

48:23.902 --> 48:25.571
<i>his mother's name.</i>

48:25.696 --> 48:27.322
So, we're looking through the book,

48:27.447 --> 48:29.616
and we're thinking
and going back and forth,

48:29.741 --> 48:32.327
trying different names,
and finally I go, "Lisa!"

48:33.620 --> 48:37.958
<i>He said, "Yeah!"
We both loved that name.</i>

48:38.083 --> 48:44.756
<i>But later I realized he wanted
to name a line of computers</i>

48:44.881 --> 48:47.050
<i>or the next computer
the "Claire."</i>

48:47.217 --> 48:50.554
<i>I only knew this later.</i>

48:50.679 --> 48:55.892
He went back to Apple
and changed it to the "Lisa."

49:01.815 --> 49:04.860
<i>It says a lot about somebody</i>

49:04.985 --> 49:11.950
that they would have the wit,
the imagination, the audacity,

49:12.075 --> 49:16.997
to name a computer in the fashion
that Steve named this

49:17.122 --> 49:23.003
and believe that you're going to
be able to get away with it.

49:25.505 --> 49:29.509
<i>That is the sort
of very telling anecdote</i>

49:29.635 --> 49:33.472
<i>that helps illuminate
somebody's personality.</i>

49:41.521 --> 49:45.484
<i>My biological mother was
a young, unwed graduate student,</i>

49:45.609 --> 49:48.487
<i>and she decided
to put me up for adoption.</i>

49:48.612 --> 49:50.322
<i>So, everything was all set</i>

49:50.447 --> 49:53.950
<i>for me to be adopted at birth
by a lawyer and his wife.</i>

49:54.076 --> 49:56.078
Except that when I popped out,

49:56.244 --> 50:00.082
they decided at the last minute
that they really wanted a girl.

50:00.248 --> 50:02.668
So, my parents,
who were on a waiting list,

50:02.834 --> 50:05.754
got a call in the middle
of the night, asking,

50:05.962 --> 50:09.841
"We've got an unexpected baby boy.
Do you want him?"

50:09.966 --> 50:12.302
They said, "Of course."

50:13.303 --> 50:15.639
My biological mother found out later

50:15.764 --> 50:18.350
that my mother had never
graduated from college

50:18.517 --> 50:21.478
and that my father had never
graduated from high school.

50:21.645 --> 50:25.732
She refused to sign
the final adoption papers.

50:25.857 --> 50:27.734
She only relented a few months later

50:27.859 --> 50:31.822
when my parents promised
that I would go to college.

50:32.030 --> 50:34.825
This was the start in my life.

50:38.036 --> 50:41.790
<i>You know, another paradox
for him, you know, here's a guy,</i>

50:41.915 --> 50:44.668
<i>you know, being pissed off
that he was left for adoption,</i>

50:44.793 --> 50:47.629
<i>and when he has a child,
he wants to run the other way.</i>

50:47.754 --> 50:50.215
<i>Yes, that's a huge paradox.</i>

50:50.382 --> 50:55.595
Even when I first met Steve, the fact
that he was given up for adoption

50:55.721 --> 51:01.685
was a huge emotional issue
in his life.

51:01.810 --> 51:05.605
<i>I was, I remember,
right here on the lawn</i>

51:05.731 --> 51:09.943
<i>telling Lisa McMoyler, who lived
across the street, that I was adopted,</i>

51:10.068 --> 51:14.114
<i>and she said, "So, does that mean
your real parents didn't want you?"</i>

51:14.239 --> 51:17.117
<i>Ooh, lightening bolt. I remember
running into the house.</i>

51:17.242 --> 51:21.329
<i>I think I started crying, asking
my parents, and they sat me down.</i>

51:21.455 --> 51:23.373
<i>They said,
"No, you don't understand."</i>

51:23.498 --> 51:26.626
<i>They said,
"We specifically picked you."</i>

51:29.087 --> 51:33.341
<i>That was clearly
a very defining image in his life,</i>

51:33.508 --> 51:36.762
<i>both that he was rejected
and that he was special.</i>

51:39.681 --> 51:41.767
<i>The IPO was November 1980.</i>

51:41.892 --> 51:45.270
<i>By the summer of 1980,
it was clear it was going to happen,</i>

51:45.395 --> 51:48.482
<i>and so Steve's net worth
was going to go from $10 million</i>

51:48.607 --> 51:51.234
<i>to around $200 million.</i>

51:51.401 --> 51:56.656
<i>And I think he had the opportunity
to completely reinvent himself.</i>

51:57.866 --> 52:02.162
<i>In his reinvention, some
people who helped him were left behind.</i>

52:03.121 --> 52:04.956
<i>Woz had no taste for management,</i>

52:05.081 --> 52:09.252
<i>so he left Apple with a big stock
package and a lifetime stipend.</i>

52:10.170 --> 52:14.466
<i>Daniel Kottke had been
one of Apple's first employees.</i>

52:14.591 --> 52:17.469
<i>In the run-up to the IPO,
an Apple executive offered</i>

52:17.594 --> 52:20.555
<i>to give Daniel the same amount
of stock that Steve would give.</i>

52:20.680 --> 52:24.893
<i>Steve replied,
"Fine. I'll give him zero."</i>

52:29.064 --> 52:33.443
<i>Jobs also saw an opportunity
to rewrite his history with Chrisann.</i>

52:33.568 --> 52:38.198
<i>He composed a fiction which implied
she had many sexual partners,</i>

52:38.323 --> 52:40.283
<i>and he claimed he was sterile</i>

52:40.450 --> 52:45.163
<i>and therefore did not have the physical
capacity to procreate a child.</i>

52:48.667 --> 52:53.171
<i>A woman with a baby,
and I was that threatening to them.</i>

52:53.296 --> 52:56.633
<i>"If he'd said," I can't do this,
but let me help</i>

52:56.758 --> 52:59.886
because I can be practical here,"

53:00.011 --> 53:02.013
that would have been...

53:02.180 --> 53:04.766
made for so much.

53:04.891 --> 53:09.104
But it almost seemed that the point
was to be out of integrity.

53:10.564 --> 53:14.276
<i>When a court-ordered DNA test
proved Jobs's paternity,</i>

53:14.442 --> 53:17.696
<i>he stopped fighting Chrisann
in court.</i>

53:17.863 --> 53:19.698
<i>She was on welfare at the time,</i>

53:19.865 --> 53:24.953
<i>so Jobs reluctantly agreed to pay
$500 a month in child support.</i>

53:26.454 --> 53:30.834
<i>When Apple went public,
he was worth nearly $200 million.</i>

53:30.959 --> 53:33.712
<i>Steve is so hugely successful,</i>

53:33.837 --> 53:37.507
<i>and yet he treated
so many people so badly.</i>

53:37.674 --> 53:41.928
How much of an asshole
do you have to be to be successful?

53:42.053 --> 53:44.014
What is the moral of the story here?

53:44.139 --> 53:46.391
<i>Hello. I am Macintosh.</i>

53:46.558 --> 53:50.270
<i>It is with considerable pride
that I introduce a man</i>

53:50.395 --> 53:53.690
<i>who's been like a father to me.
Steve Jobs.</i>

54:14.669 --> 54:17.547
<i>He didn't know
what real connection was.</i>

54:19.174 --> 54:24.262
So he was a part of the technology
that connected the world.

54:25.180 --> 54:27.057
Does that make sense?

54:29.017 --> 54:32.729
He made up another kind of connection.

54:39.027 --> 54:41.071
You know,
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

54:41.237 --> 54:47.410
There's a version of Steve Jobs
presenting the iPhone

54:47.577 --> 54:52.916
<i>where you can see his own feeling
of "I love this object."</i>

54:53.041 --> 54:54.626
Isn't this awesome?

54:54.834 --> 55:01.424
His stuff was beloved,
but it wasn't that he was beloved.

55:01.591 --> 55:03.802
<i>He wasn't a nice guy.</i>

55:03.927 --> 55:06.513
<i>First, he had a reputation
as a womanizer,</i>

55:06.638 --> 55:07.931
<i>and then he had a reputation</i>

55:08.056 --> 55:13.061
<i>as sort of not caring about anybody
and as being kind of a tough guy.</i>

55:14.145 --> 55:19.109
<i>People are not connected to him
because of his character.</i>

55:19.234 --> 55:22.070
That is not people's connection to him.

55:22.195 --> 55:25.949
In <i>Be Here Now</i> by Ram Dass,

55:26.074 --> 55:30.328
one of the memories I still have
after all these years

55:30.453 --> 55:34.749
<i>was when someone goes into
a state of enlightenment...</i>

55:36.251 --> 55:40.130
<i>but they do it while
they're still attached to their ego...</i>

55:41.256 --> 55:46.094
<i>They call that, as I recall him
saying it, "the golden chain."</i>

55:49.055 --> 55:52.017
<i>And that's what I feel
happened to Steve.</i>

55:53.476 --> 55:59.607
<i>He went into magnificence
and into enlightenment, but he...</i>

56:01.234 --> 56:03.111
He just...

56:04.112 --> 56:05.530
He blew it.

56:08.450 --> 56:11.036
<i>Steve Jobs blew it?</i>

56:11.161 --> 56:14.706
<i>How many people in the world
believe that?</i>

56:14.831 --> 56:18.043
<i>He made products everyone loved.</i>

56:18.209 --> 56:22.797
<i>He was the computer era's
most successful entrepreneur.</i>

56:22.922 --> 56:25.842
<i>How could anyone think he blew it?</i>

56:27.677 --> 56:30.138
<i>The entrepreneur's a person
who wants to shake things up,</i>

56:30.263 --> 56:34.059
who wants to change things,
who sees a better way of doing that.

56:34.184 --> 56:37.562
But he or she tends to be
a royal pain in the neck.

56:37.729 --> 56:40.648
<i>Apple computer has sued
its co-founder and former chairman,</i>

56:40.774 --> 56:43.318
<i>Steven Jobs, to stop him
from starting a rival company.</i>

56:43.443 --> 56:48.031
Jobs quit Apple last week in a bitter
fight with his board and management.

56:48.156 --> 56:49.741
<i>So, Apple is reorganizing.</i>

56:49.866 --> 56:53.661
<i>John Sculley is taking control
from Steven Jobs.</i>

56:53.787 --> 56:56.664
<i>Tell us about your departure
from Apple.</i>

56:56.831 --> 57:01.044
Oh, it was very painful. I'm not even
sure I want to talk about it. Um...

57:04.422 --> 57:06.841
What can I say? I hired the wrong guy.

57:06.966 --> 57:09.427
- That was Sculley?
- Yeah.

57:09.552 --> 57:15.683
<i>And... he destroyed everything
I'd spent ten years working for.</i>

57:30.907 --> 57:35.203
<i>What did you do
after you left Apple in 1985?</i>

57:35.370 --> 57:39.165
I started two companies.

57:39.290 --> 57:41.167
One was started

57:41.292 --> 57:46.548
<i>by buying the computer-graphics
division of Lucasfilm.</i>

57:46.714 --> 57:49.467
<i>We christened it Pixar.</i>

57:49.592 --> 57:53.138
<i>Pixar was acquired by Disney.</i>

57:53.263 --> 57:56.558
<i>I'm on the board of directors
of the Walt Disney Company.</i>

57:57.767 --> 58:00.395
<i>And the other was called NeXT.</i>

58:02.939 --> 58:06.067
From having left
or been bounced from Apple,

58:06.192 --> 58:08.319
did he have a kind of a chip
on his shoulder?

58:08.444 --> 58:13.366
Was there some...
Was this Steve in the wilderness?

58:13.491 --> 58:15.451
I don't think he felt he was
in the wilderness at all.

58:15.577 --> 58:19.497
I think he felt he was on a path.
He was on a mission.

58:19.622 --> 58:21.583
Where are we going to?

58:21.749 --> 58:24.335
<i>In 1986, after he had left Apple</i>

58:24.460 --> 58:27.297
<i>and was in the process
of starting this new company,</i>

58:27.505 --> 58:30.633
<i>"Esquire" convinced him to
give a journalist a week of his time.</i>

58:30.800 --> 58:33.386
<i>So, I basically spent that week
with him,</i>

58:33.511 --> 58:36.848
<i>talked to him a lot, went to dinner,
sat in on meetings,</i>

58:36.973 --> 58:41.436
and got to see Jobs as he was
at that moment in his life.

58:41.561 --> 58:44.814
But, I mean, I agree that...
Let me back up a bit.

58:44.939 --> 58:46.482
So, somebody's got to say,

58:46.608 --> 58:49.736
"Here's what we can do,
and we can make it happen,

58:49.861 --> 58:53.156
and here's the level of thing
we can ship in 16 months."

58:53.281 --> 58:55.658
And what I hear him saying is,

58:55.825 --> 58:58.244
"Well, anything more than
a port of Mac author, forget it."

58:58.369 --> 59:00.163
And boy, that just makes me smoke.

59:00.288 --> 59:02.832
<i>If he was in a meeting
and somebody said,</i>

59:02.999 --> 59:07.295
"Here's a great idea," and put the idea
out there and he didn't like it,

59:07.420 --> 59:09.714
he'd just chop the person
into mincemeat.

59:09.881 --> 59:11.883
The problem I've got, though,
is one,

59:12.008 --> 59:14.969
will everybody believe
that the stake is in fact in the ground,

59:15.094 --> 59:16.804
and, secondly,
when software comes back

59:16.930 --> 59:19.057
and says what they can do
by summer or spring of '87,

59:19.182 --> 59:20.433
will they be telling us the truth?

59:20.600 --> 59:22.810
Well, George, I can't change the world,
you know.

59:22.936 --> 59:25.104
What do you want me to do?
What's the solution?

59:25.230 --> 59:26.898
But you see,
what we can learn is...

59:27.023 --> 59:29.317
What I want is probably irrelevant.

59:29.442 --> 59:31.569
I mean,
there are certain realities here,

59:31.694 --> 59:35.031
both psychological and market,

59:35.156 --> 59:39.118
that are going to come into play,
in my own personal judgment.

59:39.244 --> 59:42.121
And I think this is a window
that we've got. We've been given it.

59:42.247 --> 59:44.707
And thank God we've been given it.
Nobody else has done this.

59:44.874 --> 59:47.126
It's a wonderful window.
We have 18 months.

59:48.169 --> 59:52.048
<i>The article was about people
who are maniacal about work.</i>

59:52.173 --> 59:54.926
<i>And Steve Jobs was the most maniacal
person I could think of,</i>

59:55.134 --> 59:57.220
<i>which is why I wanted
to write about him.</i>

59:57.345 --> 01:00:00.056
<i>You made the connection
in that first piece a bunch of times,</i>

01:00:00.181 --> 01:00:01.975
<i>you know, the monk among priests.</i>

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.228
<i>What was the relationship
between that extreme</i>

01:00:05.353 --> 01:00:08.273
<i>of working 24/7
and that monastic life?</i>

01:00:08.398 --> 01:00:12.235
I mean, he did seem to have
that rather interesting dedication.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:17.156
OK, so, a monomaniacal commitment
to something

01:00:17.282 --> 01:00:19.575
is something
that most people don't have.

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:28.626
<i>And that, like the monk, requires you
to kind of shed extraneous things,</i>

01:00:28.751 --> 01:00:32.088
<i>and Steve Jobs absolutely,
positively had that.</i>

01:00:46.769 --> 01:00:48.896
<i>Jobs talked about
becoming a monk</i>

01:00:49.022 --> 01:00:53.067
<i>at this remote Zen temple
where Kobun Chino had studied.</i>

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:02.410
<i>I wonder what he liked
about the idea of it.</i>

01:01:05.538 --> 01:01:10.585
<i>Was it the discipline of the monks?
Their unwavering focus?</i>

01:01:28.394 --> 01:01:31.689
<i>In meditation, Jobs loved
inspecting his own mind</i>

01:01:31.814 --> 01:01:33.775
<i>and changing the way it worked.</i>

01:01:33.941 --> 01:01:36.569
<i>He focused on the spirit of things</i>

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:39.864
<i>and sought perfection
in the machines he made.</i>

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.410
<i>But Kobun thought
Jobs was missing the point.</i>

01:01:44.577 --> 01:01:47.955
<i>A search for perfection
would never bring him peace</i>

01:01:48.081 --> 01:01:50.666
<i>or harmony with those around him.</i>

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.839
<i>But maybe harmony is
what Jobs was looking for in Japan.</i>

01:01:58.674 --> 01:02:03.096
<i>He went there dozens of times,
and not just for business.</i>

01:02:03.221 --> 01:02:06.391
<i>He stayed in fancy hotels,
not Zen temples,</i>

01:02:06.516 --> 01:02:09.727
<i>but right to the end,
he kept going back.</i>

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.653
<i>After he met and later married
Laurene Powell,</i>

01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:21.531
<i>he would take three
of his four children there,</i>

01:02:21.656 --> 01:02:23.491
<i>including Lisa.</i>

01:02:26.077 --> 01:02:29.247
<i>Jobs's relationship with Lisa
remained full of conflict,</i>

01:02:29.455 --> 01:02:34.168
<i>but a few years before Jobs's death,
Lisa wrote about a moment of peace.</i>

01:02:36.504 --> 01:02:40.675
<i>I didn't live with him, but he
would stop by our house some days,</i>

01:02:40.883 --> 01:02:44.595
<i>a deity among us for
a few tingly moments or hours.</i>

01:02:46.139 --> 01:02:49.267
<i>He was a more extreme vegetarian
than my mother and I</i>

01:02:49.392 --> 01:02:51.352
<i>and sharp-focused.</i>

01:02:51.477 --> 01:02:55.606
<i>One day, he spit out a mouthful of soup
after hearing it contained butter.</i>

01:02:55.731 --> 01:02:59.944
<i>With him, one ate a variety of salads.</i>

01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:05.158
<i>He believed that great harvests
came from arid sources.</i>

01:03:05.283 --> 01:03:07.326
<i>Pleasure from restraint.</i>

01:03:07.452 --> 01:03:11.664
<i>He knew the equations
that most people didn't know.</i>

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:14.584
<i>Things led to their opposites.</i>

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:19.755
<i>But once, he took me with him
on a business trip to Tokyo</i>

01:03:19.881 --> 01:03:23.968
<i>where we went to a sushi bar
in the basement of the Okura hotel</i>

01:03:24.093 --> 01:03:28.848
<i>with its high ceilings and low couches,
like a Hitchcock set.</i>

01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:33.269
<i>He ordered great trays of unagi sushi,
cooked eel on rice.</i>

01:03:33.394 --> 01:03:37.440
<i>He ordered too many pieces, knowing
we wouldn't be able to finish them,</i>

01:03:37.565 --> 01:03:40.943
<i>but that we didn't want
to feel they would run out.</i>

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:44.113
<i>It was the first time I'd felt,
with him,</i>

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:48.159
<i>so relaxed and content
over those trays of meat.</i>

01:03:48.284 --> 01:03:52.997
<i>The excess, the permission and warmth
after the cold salads</i>

01:03:53.164 --> 01:03:58.461
<i>meant a once inaccessible space
had opened.</i>

01:03:58.586 --> 01:04:01.297
<i>He was less rigid with himself,</i>

01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:05.176
<i>even human under the great ceilings
with the little chairs,</i>

01:04:05.384 --> 01:04:07.553
<i>with the meat and me.</i>

01:04:09.597 --> 01:04:14.602
<i>But the event was not self-sustaining.
We went back home to salads.</i>

01:04:14.727 --> 01:04:18.689
<i>They satisfied me less
now that I knew the alternative.</i>

01:04:24.237 --> 01:04:27.865
- What eventually happened to NeXT?
- Apple purchased it.

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:33.287
- OK, when?
- I believe 1997.

01:04:33.454 --> 01:04:37.917
<i>When Apple bought NeXT,
Apple was pretty messed up.</i>

01:04:38.042 --> 01:04:39.794
<i>It was pretty easy to see.</i>

01:04:39.919 --> 01:04:41.045
Apple Computer,

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:43.464
a pioneer in the personal computers
and software business,

01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:44.882
has fallen on hard times.

01:04:45.007 --> 01:04:46.342
<i>Over a three-month period,</i>

01:04:46.467 --> 01:04:50.429
<i>Apple's profits plunged
by more than $50 million.</i>

01:04:50.555 --> 01:04:54.392
<i>With big losses in the last
quarter, with profit margins shrinking,</i>

01:04:54.517 --> 01:04:56.644
<i>Apple seems destined for a takeover.</i>

01:04:56.769 --> 01:04:59.647
<i>Steve Jobs co-founded Apple
with Steve Wozniak,</i>

01:04:59.772 --> 01:05:02.358
<i>and on Friday,
Apple went to the well once again,</i>

01:05:02.483 --> 01:05:04.235
<i>bringing Jobs back as a consultant,</i>

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.654
<i>writing one
of the most unlikely chapters ever</i>

01:05:06.862 --> 01:05:08.489
<i>in the lore that is Silicon Valley.</i>

01:05:08.614 --> 01:05:09.949
Steve.

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:23.963
<i>I joined the company
in February '97.</i>

01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:27.466
After a couple of days there,
I was in complete shock.

01:05:29.802 --> 01:05:33.514
The company was close to bankruptcy,
and it was total chaos.

01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:36.809
<i>The NeXTacquisition
had just occurred,</i>

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:39.020
<i>and there were major changes
going on.</i>

01:05:39.228 --> 01:05:43.649
<i>And Steve was involved at that point
in time, but on the margins.</i>

01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:46.569
I haven't been back here
in over ten years,

01:05:46.694 --> 01:05:50.448
so, yeah, it's an interesting feeling.

01:05:50.615 --> 01:05:53.242
It's a little strange,
but not too strange.

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:54.827
<i>At some point in time,</i>

01:05:54.952 --> 01:05:57.955
<i>the process was started
to look for a full-time CEO.</i>

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.333
<i>And at that point in time,
Steve got much more involved.</i>

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:01.751
<i>Now, he still wasn't the CEO.</i>

01:06:01.876 --> 01:06:05.338
I don't think he was 100% sure
the company was savable yet,

01:06:05.463 --> 01:06:08.049
and so I think he was
hedging his bets a little bit.

01:06:08.215 --> 01:06:12.845
<i>He had to make a decision whether he
really wanted to take on that role</i>

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:16.307
<i>because being CEO of Apple
is an all-consuming role,</i>

01:06:16.432 --> 01:06:18.934
<i>and I'm not sure Steve thought
that that's something</i>

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:23.230
<i>that he wanted to do for what
turned out to be the rest of his life.</i>

01:06:23.356 --> 01:06:28.903
I took the title of Interim CEO
and agreed to come back for 90 days

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:32.740
to help recruit a full-time CEO.

01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:38.245
How did that recruitment effort go?

01:06:38.371 --> 01:06:40.081
I failed.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.714
<i>You know, the real hero
of that early part of the story</i>

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:50.091
<i>is Fred Anderson.</i>

01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:53.511
<i>Fred restructured the company
financially</i>

01:06:53.636 --> 01:06:56.764
and bought us the time to build
the foundation for today's Apple.

01:06:56.889 --> 01:07:00.017
<i>And then Fred even had an impact
on the product strategy</i>

01:07:00.142 --> 01:07:02.645
<i>because when Steve came back,</i>

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:06.565
the first major project we
started was a network computer.

01:07:06.732 --> 01:07:09.735
That was kind of the rage at the time,
but it wasn't a consumer product at all.

01:07:09.902 --> 01:07:11.570
<i>Fred kept going,
"You know, wait a minute,</i>

01:07:11.696 --> 01:07:13.280
<i>we got to have a consumer product."</i>

01:07:13.406 --> 01:07:15.116
<i>"You guys have to focus
on a low-end Mac</i>

01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:17.493
because that's what's going to
turn the company around."

01:07:18.285 --> 01:07:21.622
<i>So, the executive team and Steve
decided that we would switch</i>

01:07:21.747 --> 01:07:26.419
<i>from doing the network computer
and make that the iMac.</i>

01:07:26.627 --> 01:07:29.422
There you go, right here.
Can you see it?

01:07:31.507 --> 01:07:33.968
<i># She comes in colors everywhere</i>

01:07:34.093 --> 01:07:37.430
In the world of computers,
it's kill or be killed.

01:07:37.555 --> 01:07:40.391
And the original whiz kid was thought
to be dying an early death.

01:07:40.516 --> 01:07:44.145
We went for colors that really expressed
the spirit of the machine.

01:07:44.353 --> 01:07:47.231
And that is... you know,
it's powerful, but fun.

01:07:49.859 --> 01:07:52.486
<i>And the first thing
I thought I'd do is give you an update.</i>

01:07:52.695 --> 01:07:56.115
<i>We've managed to go from losing
a billion dollars the year before</i>

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:01.245
<i>to actually making over $200 million
during the first three quarters.</i>

01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:03.330
Boy, what a difference a year makes.

01:08:03.456 --> 01:08:05.708
Guess what? Mac is back.

01:08:08.043 --> 01:08:11.380
<i># She comes in colors everywhere</i>

01:08:11.505 --> 01:08:13.507
<i># She combs her hair</i>

01:08:13.632 --> 01:08:15.885
<i># She's like a rainbow</i>

01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:19.971
He was the kind of person that
could convince himself of things

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.600
that weren't necessarily true.

01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:26.228
<i>He could go to people
and ask them to do something</i>

01:08:26.395 --> 01:08:28.481
<i>that they thought was impossible.</i>

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:32.734
<i>Steve did create
reality distortion around him.</i>

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:35.029
You know, if he told you
the sky was green, for a while,

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:37.156
you'd kind of go, "Yeah, OK.
Yeah, the sky's green."

01:08:39.867 --> 01:08:45.288
To me... marketing is about values.

01:08:45.456 --> 01:08:50.377
This is a very complicated world.
It's a very noisy world.

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:53.798
And we're not going to get a chance

01:08:53.923 --> 01:08:59.428
to get people to remember much
about us. No company is.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.598
And so, we have to be really clear

01:09:02.723 --> 01:09:05.059
on what we want them to know
about us.

01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:07.394
Our customers want to know
who is Apple

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.395
and what is it that we stand for.

01:09:09.522 --> 01:09:15.319
What we have is something
that I am...

01:09:15.444 --> 01:09:17.904
I am very moved by.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.827
<i>Here's to the crazy ones.</i>

01:09:22.952 --> 01:09:25.287
<i>Jobs was so moved
by the ad he'd commissioned</i>

01:09:25.496 --> 01:09:28.999
<i>that he produced a version where
he did the voiceover himself.</i>

01:09:29.124 --> 01:09:32.461
<i>The round pegs in the square holes.</i>

01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:35.881
<i>The ones
who see things differently.</i>

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:40.469
<i>They're not fond of rules, and they
have no respect for the status quo.</i>

01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:47.600
<i>You can quote them, disagree with them,
glorify or vilify them.</i>

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:51.063
<i>About the only thing
you can't do is ignore them</i>

01:09:51.188 --> 01:09:53.107
<i>because they change things.</i>

01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:59.363
<i>While some may see them
as the crazy ones, we see genius.</i>

01:10:00.573 --> 01:10:04.201
<i>Because the people who are crazy enough
to think they can change the world...</i>

01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:07.830
<i>are the ones who do.</i>

01:10:11.959 --> 01:10:15.713
It honors those people
who have changed the world.

01:10:16.797 --> 01:10:21.260
Some of them are living,
some of them are not.

01:10:21.385 --> 01:10:26.932
But the ones that aren't, you know
that if they ever used a computer,

01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:28.225
it would have been a Mac.

01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:34.857
The theme of the campaign is
"Think different."

01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:39.153
<i>Think different.</i>

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:41.822
<i>In one brilliant, ungrammatical phrase,</i>

01:10:41.947 --> 01:10:47.870
<i>Jobs told a story of rebellion,
the triumph of the iconoclastic genius.</i>

01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:51.832
<i>With "Think different," was Jobs
trying to frame his own story?</i>

01:10:51.999 --> 01:10:55.419
<i>More than a CEO,
he positioned himself as an oracle,</i>

01:10:55.544 --> 01:10:58.881
<i>a man who could tell the future
of technology.</i>

01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:10.851
<i>You know, a lot of times,</i>

01:11:10.976 --> 01:11:16.148
<i>great products are sort of convergence
of the right set of technologies.</i>

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:19.693
<i>And Steve was brilliant
at getting to a fork in the road</i>

01:11:19.818 --> 01:11:22.446
<i>and choosing the right fork.</i>

01:11:22.613 --> 01:11:26.325
We got a chance to play
with a variety of music players,

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:28.243
and they sucked.

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:32.665
<i>So, we decided, Steve said,
you know, "Go build a music player."</i>

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:37.044
So, I assembled a small team to take
a look at what it would take to do it,

01:11:37.169 --> 01:11:40.631
and the conclusion was the technology
really wasn't ready yet.

01:11:40.756 --> 01:11:44.176
<i>Then in February of 2001,</i>

01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:47.513
<i>the Toshiba guys brought out
the 1.8-inch hard drive.</i>

01:11:47.638 --> 01:11:48.931
So, as soon as I saw that I go,

01:11:49.056 --> 01:11:51.141
"That's what we need
to build the iPod."

01:11:51.266 --> 01:11:55.270
<i>So, I went to Steve, and I go,
"OK, I know how to do it now."</i>

01:11:55.396 --> 01:11:56.814
<i>"I need $10 million."</i>

01:11:56.939 --> 01:12:00.442
<i>And Steve goes, "OK,
I'll write you a $10 million check."</i>

01:12:00.609 --> 01:12:03.654
I went to Fred to make sure
the check wouldn't bounce,

01:12:03.779 --> 01:12:06.281
and Fred said, "Yeah, you know, go."

01:12:06.407 --> 01:12:08.575
<i>And so I started ramping the team up,</i>

01:12:08.701 --> 01:12:12.579
<i>and, you know, we delivered
the iPod later that year.</i>

01:12:14.873 --> 01:12:16.959
<i># One, two, three, four</i>

01:12:17.084 --> 01:12:19.044
<i># Tell me that you love me more</i>

01:12:19.169 --> 01:12:21.296
<i># Sleepless long nights</i>

01:12:21.422 --> 01:12:23.382
<i># That is what my youth was for</i>

01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:25.467
<i># Oh, oh, oh</i>

01:12:25.634 --> 01:12:27.970
<i># You're changing your heart</i>

01:12:28.095 --> 01:12:29.805
<i># Oh, oh, oh</i>

01:12:29.972 --> 01:12:32.182
<i># You know who you are</i>

01:12:32.307 --> 01:12:34.393
<i># One, two, three, four</i>

01:12:34.518 --> 01:12:36.228
<i># Tell me that you love me more</i>

01:12:36.353 --> 01:12:38.522
<i># Sleepless long nights</i>

01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:40.607
<i># That is what my youth was for</i>

01:12:40.733 --> 01:12:43.193
<i># Oh, teenage hopes</i>

01:12:46.071 --> 01:12:49.950
<i>Jobs's genius
was how he sold the iPod.</i>

01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:53.746
<i>It wasn't a machine for you.
It was you.</i>

01:12:56.123 --> 01:12:59.293
<i>People sometimes forget
that they're very unique</i>

01:12:59.418 --> 01:13:03.172
<i>and that they have very unique
feelings and perspectives.</i>

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:04.798
You know,
the whole computer industry

01:13:04.923 --> 01:13:09.303
wants to forget about the humanist side
and just focus on the technology,

01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:12.347
but we think there's
a whole other side to the coin,

01:13:12.473 --> 01:13:14.558
which is what do you do
with these things?

01:13:14.725 --> 01:13:18.687
Can we do more than just spreadsheets
and word processors?

01:13:18.812 --> 01:13:21.815
Can we help you express yourself
in richer ways?

01:13:24.735 --> 01:13:29.073
<i>Apple at the core, its core value,</i>

01:13:29.198 --> 01:13:33.577
<i>is that we believe
that people with passion</i>

01:13:33.744 --> 01:13:35.871
<i>can change the world for the better.</i>

01:13:35.996 --> 01:13:37.956
That's what we believe.

01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:42.252
<i>Steve talks a lot
about the values of the company.</i>

01:13:42.377 --> 01:13:44.213
<i>And said that Apple was a company</i>

01:13:44.338 --> 01:13:47.257
<i>that was designed
to make the world a better place.</i>

01:13:47.382 --> 01:13:50.052
Was that a heartfelt thing for Steve?

01:13:50.177 --> 01:13:52.554
I believe it was
a heartfelt thing for Steve.

01:13:52.721 --> 01:13:55.307
I think that he did want to make
the world a better place.

01:13:55.516 --> 01:14:00.062
I think that he felt
by delivering great products

01:14:00.187 --> 01:14:03.816
that were easy to use and beautiful,

01:14:03.941 --> 01:14:06.401
that it would
make people's lives better.

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:11.365
<i>Is that enough?</i>

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:15.119
<i>Is making and selling products,
even if they're good,</i>

01:14:15.244 --> 01:14:18.872
<i>even if they're the best, enough
to make the world a better place?</i>

01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:22.209
<i>Apple's a business.</i>

01:14:22.334 --> 01:14:25.504
And we've somehow attached
this emotion to a business,

01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:29.341
which is just there to make money
for its shareholders, right?

01:14:29.466 --> 01:14:30.926
That's all it is. Nothing more.

01:14:31.051 --> 01:14:32.886
<i>You know, creating that association</i>

01:14:33.095 --> 01:14:36.515
<i>was probably one of Steve's
greatest accomplishments.</i>

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.017
- It's queued up to play.
- Awesome.

01:14:41.937 --> 01:14:45.774
I remember at this point, when the music
plays in the beginning,

01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:47.568
there's just this energy, right?

01:14:47.734 --> 01:14:52.531
You have on the one side
this huge bank of photographers,

01:14:52.656 --> 01:14:56.577
<i>and I remember
looking at all these guys</i>

01:14:56.743 --> 01:14:59.246
with their cameras trained on Steve,
thinking,

01:14:59.371 --> 01:15:02.124
"You guys have no idea
what's about to happen."

01:15:02.249 --> 01:15:03.959
And to be fair, neither did we.

01:15:07.254 --> 01:15:09.590
Thank you for coming.

01:15:09.756 --> 01:15:11.925
We're going to make some history
together today.

01:15:13.051 --> 01:15:14.761
<i>Any time
you see an Apple event,</i>

01:15:14.887 --> 01:15:18.932
know that there's a team of people
in the audience who are just sick.

01:15:22.853 --> 01:15:26.398
We are calling it "iPhone."

01:15:28.192 --> 01:15:34.823
Today... Today,
Apple is going to reinvent the phone.

01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:38.702
And so, rather than talk about this
some more, let me show it to you.

01:15:38.869 --> 01:15:42.915
<i>So, if you're giving a demo,
and you deviate off the script,</i>

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.499
<i>well, lots of bad things
can go wrong.</i>

01:15:44.625 --> 01:15:48.378
When Steve comes up with,
"Here's what I want to show,"

01:15:48.503 --> 01:15:50.005
everything is dissected.

01:15:50.172 --> 01:15:51.506
The message that he's trying to say

01:15:51.632 --> 01:15:53.592
is then dissected
into very specific actions.

01:15:53.717 --> 01:15:57.721
And let me go ahead and get
that picture within picture up.

01:15:57.888 --> 01:16:01.058
I'm going to go ahead and just push
the "sleep wake" button.

01:16:01.183 --> 01:16:03.101
There we go, right there.

01:16:03.227 --> 01:16:06.563
And to unlock the phone, I just take
my finger and slide it across.

01:16:06.688 --> 01:16:09.149
All right, you want to see that again?

01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:14.029
<i>So, he's got, you know,
several discrete parts of the demo.</i>

01:16:14.238 --> 01:16:20.035
We had a flask of Scotch with us,
and after every little part,

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:23.997
the person who was responsible for
that portion, you know, took a hit.

01:16:24.122 --> 01:16:26.500
I want to make a call to Jony Ive.

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:27.918
I can just push here,

01:16:28.043 --> 01:16:30.587
and I see Jony Ive's contacts
with all his information.

01:16:30.712 --> 01:16:33.423
The Jony Ive call, oh, my God.

01:16:33.548 --> 01:16:36.468
<i>There's all sorts of ways that
this could have gone sideways.</i>

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:39.930
- Hey, Jony, how you doing?
<i>- I'm good. How you doing?</i>

01:16:40.055 --> 01:16:44.643
Well, it's been two-and-a-half years,
and I can't tell you how thrilled I am

01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:47.562
to make the first public phone call
with iPhone.

01:16:50.524 --> 01:16:51.942
He goes to the music.

01:16:52.067 --> 01:16:54.278
Let's go into Dylan here.

01:16:54.403 --> 01:16:56.321
Let's play <i>Like a Rolling Stone.</i>

01:16:58.991 --> 01:17:00.617
He gets the web browser up there.

01:17:00.742 --> 01:17:04.246
I want to show you Safari
running on a mobile device.

01:17:04.371 --> 01:17:06.540
So, let's go to the web.
Boom.

01:17:06.665 --> 01:17:08.333
Unbelievable.

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:11.128
And then at the end,
he has that moment

01:17:11.253 --> 01:17:13.297
where he swizzles it all together.

01:17:13.422 --> 01:17:17.009
<i>At the end, where he orders thousands
of lattes from some, you know,</i>

01:17:17.134 --> 01:17:19.428
<i>poor woman at a Starbucks
down the road.</i>

01:17:19.553 --> 01:17:21.972
<i>Good morning. This is Starbucks
and how can I help you?</i>

01:17:22.097 --> 01:17:24.558
Yes, I'd liked to order
4,000 lattes to go, please.

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:26.101
No, just kidding.

01:17:26.226 --> 01:17:29.646
Wrong number. Thank you. Bye-bye.

01:17:29.771 --> 01:17:31.481
OK.

01:17:38.739 --> 01:17:41.283
As soon as the demo was over,
we left.

01:17:41.408 --> 01:17:46.246
And we just turned San Francisco
into a... It was a shit show.

01:17:53.587 --> 01:17:55.505
That was a night to remember.

01:17:56.673 --> 01:18:00.218
<i>Man, you just had this release
of years of anxiety.</i>

01:18:00.344 --> 01:18:03.597
And then we got up tomorrow,
the next day, and did it all over again.

01:18:03.722 --> 01:18:05.599
And we had to finish the product
at this point.

01:18:05.766 --> 01:18:08.310
And that was tough,
especially with a raging hangover,

01:18:08.435 --> 01:18:10.354
but it was a lot of fun.

01:18:10.479 --> 01:18:14.316
The biggest thing he made was
the iPhone, definitely.

01:18:14.441 --> 01:18:15.984
He made the iPhone,

01:18:16.151 --> 01:18:19.780
which shocked the world
with its touch screen and stuff.

01:18:24.451 --> 01:18:28.830
So, what are we down to?
13 minutes and...

01:18:28.997 --> 01:18:30.415
Whoo-hoo!

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:33.085
- It's go time!
- Oh, yeah.

01:18:42.427 --> 01:18:46.473
- Oh, yeah. Swipe to unlock.
- Sweet!

01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:53.688
<i># All my life</i>

01:18:53.814 --> 01:18:56.066
<i># Is changing every day</i>

01:18:56.191 --> 01:18:57.692
There she is.

01:18:57.901 --> 01:19:00.070
<i># In every possible way</i>

01:19:00.195 --> 01:19:03.698
iPhone's been shipping
for exactly 200 days today.

01:19:03.824 --> 01:19:07.035
And I'm extraordinarily pleased
to report

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.497
that we have sold
four million iPhones to date.

01:19:12.457 --> 01:19:15.502
<i># Never quite as it seems</i>

01:19:15.627 --> 01:19:19.005
<i># And then I open up and see</i>

01:19:19.131 --> 01:19:23.552
<i># The person falling here is me</i>

01:19:23.677 --> 01:19:27.639
Today we're introducing
the iPhone 3G.

01:19:33.645 --> 01:19:39.192
In a little over two years,
we have sold 30 million iPhones.

01:19:47.534 --> 01:19:50.245
And with a swipe,
you have changed your life.

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:52.205
Yes!

01:20:04.509 --> 01:20:08.430
- How may I help you?
- iPhone 4. Where is the iPhone 4?

01:20:08.555 --> 01:20:12.392
Oh, I'm very sorry,
but we are currently sold out.

01:20:12.517 --> 01:20:16.688
However, we did finally get
some more HTC Evos in.

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:19.774
What? What is that?
Is it an iPhone?

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:22.694
No, it is that 4G phone on Sprint.

01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:25.238
If it's not an iPhone,
why would I want it?

01:20:25.363 --> 01:20:28.366
Well, it's similar to an iPhone,
but has a bigger screen.

01:20:28.492 --> 01:20:29.659
I don't care.

01:20:29.784 --> 01:20:32.454
The internet speeds
are around three times faster.

01:20:32.579 --> 01:20:35.207
- I don't care.
- It fucking prints money.

01:20:35.332 --> 01:20:38.251
- I don't care.
- It can grant up to three wishes.

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:40.837
Even if one of those wishes
is for an iPhone.

01:20:40.962 --> 01:20:43.465
- I don't care about any of that.
- OK, fine.

01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:46.468
Then what the hell entices you
about the iPhone 4,

01:20:46.593 --> 01:20:48.553
if you don't mind me asking?

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:50.388
It is an iPhone.

01:21:00.607 --> 01:21:05.195
<i>I remember the first set of
people I interviewed about the iPhone.</i>

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.906
<i>I've been interviewing people
about their computers</i>

01:21:08.031 --> 01:21:09.991
<i>for, you know, decades.</i>

01:21:10.158 --> 01:21:16.331
<i>I've never seen this kind of connection
before with an object.</i>

01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:21.920
<i>In the beginning,
the impulse was to sit you down</i>

01:21:22.045 --> 01:21:25.757
<i>and to show you everything
on their iPhone.</i>

01:21:25.966 --> 01:21:29.553
<i>As time's gone on,
there's been less of that</i>

01:21:29.678 --> 01:21:34.349
<i>and more of what I call
the "alone together phenomenon."</i>

01:21:37.852 --> 01:21:42.023
It has turned out to be
an isolating technology.

01:21:53.368 --> 01:21:55.412
<i>Did you ever see
that Wim Wenders film,</i>

01:21:55.537 --> 01:21:56.705
<i>"Until the End of the World"?</i>

01:21:56.830 --> 01:22:00.834
<i>Yes, I love that.
People fall in love with their dreams,</i>

01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:04.629
<i>and they walk around
with hoods over their head</i>

01:22:04.754 --> 01:22:09.050
<i>and screens in front of them,
fascinated by their dreams.</i>

01:22:09.217 --> 01:22:13.346
<i>By the time I came to rescue
Claire, the only thing she cared about</i>

01:22:13.471 --> 01:22:16.850
<i>was having fresh batteries
for her video monitor.</i>

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.729
<i>It's a little bit like that.</i>

01:22:20.854 --> 01:22:24.941
<i>It's a dream machine,
and you become fascinated</i>

01:22:25.066 --> 01:22:28.987
<i>by the world that you can find
on these screens.</i>

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:34.701
<i>And the face of that technology
was Steve Jobs.</i>

01:22:55.972 --> 01:23:00.018
What would you say about
the responsibilities of power

01:23:00.143 --> 01:23:03.480
once you've achieved
a certain level of success?

01:23:03.605 --> 01:23:07.025
Power? What is that?

01:23:13.865 --> 01:23:16.326
<i># Your daddy, he's an outlaw</i>

01:23:16.534 --> 01:23:18.912
<i>He found a loophole
where if you lease a car,</i>

01:23:19.037 --> 01:23:22.832
you have a six-month grace period
to put license plates on.

01:23:22.957 --> 01:23:28.546
And so he leased the same car
every six months,

01:23:28.672 --> 01:23:30.840
to avoid putting license plates
at all.

01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:32.676
<i>I think he told people</i>

01:23:32.801 --> 01:23:37.389
that it's because he didn't
want people to identify him.

01:23:37.514 --> 01:23:39.432
Well, there's nothing more identifiable

01:23:39.557 --> 01:23:41.893
than a silver Mercedes
with no license plate.

01:23:42.018 --> 01:23:44.646
I mean, it screams "Steve Jobs"
in the Valley.

01:23:44.771 --> 01:23:48.566
Riding to work with Steve Jobs.

01:23:48.692 --> 01:23:51.611
Riding to work
with the good ol' Stevie.

01:23:53.947 --> 01:23:57.575
Oh, look at that,
he's in the carpool lane.

01:23:57.701 --> 01:24:01.579
And it does give you a glimpse
of how he thought he was above the law.

01:24:01.705 --> 01:24:06.334
<i># He oversees his kingdom
Where no stranger does intrude</i>

01:24:06.501 --> 01:24:09.337
<i># His voice
It trembles as he calls out</i>

01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:12.006
<i># For another plate of food</i>

01:24:12.132 --> 01:24:15.593
<i># One more cup of coffee for the road</i>

01:24:15.719 --> 01:24:19.431
<i>Jobs also made it a habit
to park his plateless Mercedes Benz</i>

01:24:19.556 --> 01:24:22.475
<i>in handicap parking spots
around the Apple campus.</i>

01:24:23.893 --> 01:24:26.396
<i>It even became something
of a pastime in the Valley,</i>

01:24:26.521 --> 01:24:29.315
<i>to take a picture next to Steve's car.</i>

01:24:30.608 --> 01:24:34.696
<i># One more cup of coffee before I go</i>

01:24:34.821 --> 01:24:37.323
<i># To the valley below</i>

01:24:41.619 --> 01:24:45.373
<i>He was a hero in the Valley
because he made buckets of money,</i>

01:24:45.498 --> 01:24:46.916
<i>but unlike Bill Gates,</i>

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:50.837
<i>Jobs told people that giving away money
was a waste of time.</i>

01:24:50.962 --> 01:24:56.926
<i>Under Jobs, Apple terminated
its philanthropic programs.</i>

01:24:57.051 --> 01:25:00.180
<i>Jobs kept acting
as if Apple was a start-up,</i>

01:25:00.346 --> 01:25:04.642
<i>but by 2010, it was one of the most
valuable companies in the world.</i>

01:25:05.685 --> 01:25:09.230
<i>Among the rich and famous,
Jobs was a compelling character.</i>

01:25:09.397 --> 01:25:14.736
<i>A counter-culture businessman.
But what were his values as a citizen?</i>

01:25:14.861 --> 01:25:17.447
<i>Was he interested in power
to change the world</i>

01:25:17.572 --> 01:25:20.825
<i>or the right to have power
without responsibility?</i>

01:25:24.412 --> 01:25:27.123
<i>There was an experience
where actually a couple of people</i>

01:25:27.248 --> 01:25:28.958
<i>were fighting over you,
were they not?</i>

01:25:29.083 --> 01:25:32.003
- Oh, man. I went to Palm.
- Then a bunch of people went to Palm.

01:25:32.128 --> 01:25:33.588
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:33.713 --> 01:25:36.382
- Was Steve pissed off?
- Oh, man. Yeah.

01:25:36.508 --> 01:25:40.762
I gave my resignation.
It went up the chain, like you do.

01:25:40.887 --> 01:25:45.266
And just sure as hell,
like 20 minutes later,

01:25:45.433 --> 01:25:48.686
I get a call from Steve's admin,
"Steve wants to see you."

01:25:49.896 --> 01:25:53.066
<i>He sits down. He just kind of sits
there, and he looks at me.</i>

01:25:53.191 --> 01:25:56.611
And I start to kind of launch
into my little spiel that I had planned,

01:25:56.736 --> 01:26:00.865
and he says, "You know
you fucked up Bluetooth, right?"

01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:03.117
I just stopped. I'm like...

01:26:03.326 --> 01:26:06.746
And then we go through
this half-hour mind fuck.

01:26:06.871 --> 01:26:09.082
<i>It becomes very "Godfather" -esque.</i>

01:26:09.207 --> 01:26:12.418
<i>You know, "You're part of my family,
and Apple's my family,</i>

01:26:12.544 --> 01:26:14.254
<i>and you don't want to leave my family."</i>

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:18.341
And at the end, he says,
"If you choose to leave my family,"

01:26:18.508 --> 01:26:23.179
should you decide to take so much
as one member of my family away from me,

01:26:23.304 --> 01:26:25.431
"I will personally take you down."

01:26:26.558 --> 01:26:28.601
<i>To keep his family together,</i>

01:26:28.726 --> 01:26:33.565
<i>Jobs was willing to let Apple bend
or even break the law.</i>

01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:36.860
<i>In 2011, a class-action lawsuit</i>

01:26:36.985 --> 01:26:40.280
<i>filed by more than
64,000 Silicon Valley workers</i>

01:26:40.446 --> 01:26:44.701
<i>revealed that Jobs, along with
the CEOs of Google, Intel and Adobe</i>

01:26:44.826 --> 01:26:48.371
<i>had colluded not to recruit
each other's employees.</i>

01:26:48.538 --> 01:26:51.666
If you're working there at Apple,
or wherever you're working,

01:26:51.791 --> 01:26:54.752
you've got another company
that you might move to

01:26:54.878 --> 01:26:57.797
and take your expertise with you
and earn more money at that company.

01:26:57.922 --> 01:27:00.842
They won't accept your rÃ©sumÃ©.
They won't return your phone calls.

01:27:00.967 --> 01:27:03.511
Right. Because they won't
let them poach each other.

01:27:03.636 --> 01:27:06.055
- Correct.
- That's not a legitimate situation.

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:08.057
You know what some of
the strongest evidence was?

01:27:08.182 --> 01:27:10.476
E-mails of the late, great Steve Jobs.

01:27:10.602 --> 01:27:12.270
- Really?
- Tons of them, yes.

01:27:17.734 --> 01:27:20.695
<i>Less than a month after
Google co-founder Sergey Brin</i>

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:22.864
<i>received this threat from Jobs,</i>

01:27:22.989 --> 01:27:28.536
<i>Google circulated a "do not cold
call" list that included Apple.</i>

01:27:28.661 --> 01:27:31.205
<i>Two years later, Google tried again,</i>

01:27:31.331 --> 01:27:34.208
<i>and Jobs e-mailed Google CEO
Eric Schmidt</i>

01:27:34.334 --> 01:27:36.753
<i>to remind him of their
gentlemen's agreement.</i>

01:27:39.255 --> 01:27:41.591
<i>Schmidt placated Jobs by assuring him</i>

01:27:41.716 --> 01:27:45.595
<i>that the culprit would be fired
within the hour.</i>

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.431
<i>When Jobs learned
that the woman had been canned,</i>

01:27:48.681 --> 01:27:52.393
<i>he showed his pleasure
in two efficient keystrokes.</i>

01:27:58.024 --> 01:28:01.277
Someone's going to come out
of the door. Do we want a shot of that?

01:28:05.531 --> 01:28:08.034
Are you taking a picture
of the inside?

01:28:08.159 --> 01:28:10.620
We're taking a picture
of the Apple logo on the door.

01:28:10.745 --> 01:28:14.207
OK, we cannot have people
taking pictures.

01:28:14.332 --> 01:28:16.084
<i>Tonight, a Wall Street scandal</i>

01:28:16.209 --> 01:28:19.045
<i>has reached deep into
an iconic American company,</i>

01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:20.713
<i>the Apple Corporation.</i>

01:28:20.838 --> 01:28:23.299
It all centers on an alleged scheme

01:28:23.424 --> 01:28:27.679
to under-report Apple's expenses
by $40 million,

01:28:27.804 --> 01:28:29.555
including $20 million

01:28:29.681 --> 01:28:33.226
that went straight to the company's
celebrity CEO Steve Jobs,

01:28:33.393 --> 01:28:38.231
<i>in the form of what are known
as backdated options.</i>

01:28:38.356 --> 01:28:42.902
I first met Steve Jobs shortly after
I became editor of <i>Fortune</i> magazine.

01:28:43.945 --> 01:28:46.656
<i>"And I said," Listen, we'd love to have
a good relationship with Apple</i>

01:28:46.781 --> 01:28:47.782
<i>and do stories about you."</i>

01:28:47.907 --> 01:28:50.493
And he said, "Look,
this is how it's going to work."

01:28:50.618 --> 01:28:52.787
"You know,
you want to do a story about us,

01:28:52.912 --> 01:28:56.791
you call us up, propose it,
you know, we'll think about it."

01:28:56.916 --> 01:28:59.794
"We'll basically
come up with the ideas with you,"

01:28:59.919 --> 01:29:02.171
or come up with the ideas,
we'll call you,

01:29:02.296 --> 01:29:06.968
"we'll figure out who the writer is going
to be on your staff to do the story."

01:29:07.093 --> 01:29:11.222
And I said, "Well, you know, Steve,
that's not really how we do things."

01:29:11.347 --> 01:29:13.433
And he goes, "That's how
you do things with Apple."

01:29:14.434 --> 01:29:15.393
<i>So I say to myself,</i>

01:29:15.518 --> 01:29:18.604
<i>"Why don't we do a story
about the stock options?"</i>

01:29:18.730 --> 01:29:21.107
<i>"Because no one's
really figured it out."</i>

01:29:21.232 --> 01:29:25.862
So, I decided to put one of our top
investigative reporters on the story,

01:29:25.987 --> 01:29:26.988
Peter Elkind.

01:29:27.113 --> 01:29:30.533
Steve Jobs had a very talented group
of key lieutenants around him.

01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:34.996
<i>And he wanted give his people stock
option grants that were so big,</i>

01:29:35.121 --> 01:29:37.331
<i>that they wouldn't even think about
going somewhere else</i>

01:29:37.457 --> 01:29:39.375
<i>because the upside was so enormous.</i>

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:44.630
The key thing is if the stock goes up,

01:29:44.756 --> 01:29:47.884
which we always hope it does,

01:29:48.009 --> 01:29:53.306
then the golden handcuffs are
dramatically increased,

01:29:53.431 --> 01:29:56.642
which is what I was hoping
would happen.

01:29:57.518 --> 01:29:59.729
<i>To make those option deals
even sweeter,</i>

01:29:59.854 --> 01:30:04.067
<i>companies would allow executives
to buy stock on dates in the past</i>

01:30:04.192 --> 01:30:05.359
<i>when the price was low</i>

01:30:05.485 --> 01:30:08.446
<i>so executives could make
millions in the blink of an eye.</i>

01:30:08.571 --> 01:30:10.364
<i>This was called "backdating."</i>

01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:12.325
<i>And it seemed like
the perfect solution,</i>

01:30:12.533 --> 01:30:13.534
<i>except for one thing.</i>

01:30:13.701 --> 01:30:16.954
<i>If not properly reported,
backdating is illegal.</i>

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:20.583
200 US public companies
are under investigation

01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:24.921
over charges of backdated stock options
for their senior executives.

01:30:26.297 --> 01:30:28.132
<i>Backdating was a dicey game,</i>

01:30:28.257 --> 01:30:30.927
<i>and it landed several executives
in jail for fraud,</i>

01:30:31.052 --> 01:30:34.555
<i>but it became a frequent practice
at Apple under Jobs.</i>

01:30:34.722 --> 01:30:37.141
<i>Apple eventually conducted
an internal investigation</i>

01:30:37.266 --> 01:30:38.559
<i>and found thousands of cases</i>

01:30:38.726 --> 01:30:40.937
<i>where stock options had been
handled inappropriately.</i>

01:30:41.062 --> 01:30:43.606
None of that had taken place
according to the company's own report

01:30:43.856 --> 01:30:46.067
before Steve Jobs had returned there.

01:30:46.192 --> 01:30:49.237
<i>A key advisor on many of
the troubled backdating schemes</i>

01:30:49.362 --> 01:30:52.990
<i>was a powerful Silicon Valley attorney,
Larry Sonsini.</i>

01:30:53.116 --> 01:30:55.201
<i>Larry Sonsini had kind of</i>

01:30:55.326 --> 01:30:57.495
spread this dark art
in the world of Silicon Valley.

01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:01.374
<i>He's the guy who whispered to the CEOs
of all the top tech companies,</i>

01:31:01.541 --> 01:31:03.042
<i>"Here's how you can do this."</i>

01:31:03.167 --> 01:31:05.920
<i>He was certainly very close
to Steve Jobs.</i>

01:31:06.045 --> 01:31:09.549
<i>Sonsini had known Jobs
since Apple went public in 1980</i>

01:31:09.715 --> 01:31:13.302
<i>and had been a board member at Pixar
when it created a vast program</i>

01:31:13.427 --> 01:31:16.639
<i>of brazenly backdated options
for top executives.</i>

01:31:16.806 --> 01:31:19.600
<i>Yet despite Jobs's long history
with backdating,</i>

01:31:19.725 --> 01:31:23.104
<i>Apple's own investigation,
led by Al Gore,</i>

01:31:23.229 --> 01:31:26.023
<i>absolved Jobs of any wrongdoing.</i>

01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:28.860
<i>Their conclusion was that
Steve Jobs didn't appreciate</i>

01:31:28.985 --> 01:31:31.529
<i>the accounting implications
of the issue.</i>

01:31:31.654 --> 01:31:34.824
I know you're not an accountant,
but do you have an understanding

01:31:34.991 --> 01:31:38.619
as to what generally accepted
accounting principles are?

01:31:38.786 --> 01:31:40.454
Not really.

01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:42.415
<i>Jobs's accounting naivetÃ©</i>

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:45.418
<i>would be challenged by
his own CFO, Fred Anderson.</i>

01:31:45.543 --> 01:31:48.004
<i>A hero during Apple's comeback,</i>

01:31:48.129 --> 01:31:52.633
<i>Anderson was one exec who
took the fall for backdating.</i>

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.928
As Apple's chief financial officer,
Mr Anderson,

01:31:56.053 --> 01:31:59.307
you had overall responsibility
to ensure that the company

01:31:59.432 --> 01:32:03.102
complied with all financial
reporting requirements, true?

01:32:03.227 --> 01:32:05.354
On advice of council,

01:32:05.479 --> 01:32:09.567
I decline to answer based
on my Fifth Amendment rights.

01:32:09.692 --> 01:32:11.277
<i>When the SEC investigated,</i>

01:32:11.402 --> 01:32:14.614
<i>Apple effectively
threw Anderson under the bus.</i>

01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:17.116
<i>He was forced to resign
from Apple's board</i>

01:32:17.241 --> 01:32:20.411
<i>and to pay $3.6 million in penalties.</i>

01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:24.290
<i>But in a very unusual statement,
Anderson's lawyer made it clear</i>

01:32:24.415 --> 01:32:28.836
<i>that Fred had relied on statements
by Jobs that turned out to be false</i>

01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:32.840
<i>and that Anderson had explained
the dangers of backdating to Jobs.</i>

01:32:32.965 --> 01:32:37.553
Now, this contradicted exactly what
Jobs and the company had maintained

01:32:37.678 --> 01:32:40.223
which was that Steve Jobs didn't
appreciate why this was a problem.

01:32:40.348 --> 01:32:42.934
<i>I think the notion
that Steve Jobs knew nothing</i>

01:32:43.059 --> 01:32:45.603
<i>and Fred Anderson and Nancy Heinen
were entirely responsible</i>

01:32:45.853 --> 01:32:46.687
<i>is ridiculous.</i>

01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:49.357
<i>The company has confirmed</i>

01:32:49.482 --> 01:32:52.485
<i>that Jobs himself
was awarded backdated options</i>

01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:55.613
<i>that carried a false date
in October 2001.</i>

01:32:55.738 --> 01:32:58.574
<i>According to Apple's own report
to the SEC,</i>

01:32:58.699 --> 01:33:03.162
<i>"The award was" improperly recorded
as occurring at a special board meeting</i>

01:33:03.287 --> 01:33:06.874
<i>when in fact such a board meeting
did not occur."</i>

01:33:06.999 --> 01:33:12.964
<i>A fictitious board meeting
that awarded Jobs 7.5 million options.</i>

01:33:13.089 --> 01:33:15.049
<i>Just what was going on?</i>

01:33:15.174 --> 01:33:17.176
<i>At first, all fingers pointed</i>

01:33:17.301 --> 01:33:19.971
<i>to another member
of the Apple comeback team,</i>

01:33:20.096 --> 01:33:21.764
<i>General Counsel Nancy Heinen,</i>

01:33:21.931 --> 01:33:25.518
<i>who had certified the minutes
of the phony board meeting.</i>

01:33:25.643 --> 01:33:28.896
<i>Like Anderson,
Heinen would settle with the SEC</i>

01:33:29.021 --> 01:33:31.691
<i>without admitting or denying guilt.</i>

01:33:31.857 --> 01:33:37.154
<i>But her silence raised questions.
Would she have just decided on her own</i>

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.909
<i>to fake a board meeting
in order to enrich Steve Jobs?</i>

01:33:42.034 --> 01:33:44.078
<i>Who wanted this done?</i>

01:33:45.579 --> 01:33:51.085
As we've seen in the discussions
of the past hour,

01:33:51.210 --> 01:33:55.965
I spent a lot of time trying
to take care of people at Apple

01:33:56.090 --> 01:34:02.972
and to, you know,
surprise and delight them

01:34:03.097 --> 01:34:08.352
with what a career at Apple
could mean to them and their families.

01:34:09.312 --> 01:34:13.357
And I felt that the board wasn't
really doing the same with me.

01:34:13.482 --> 01:34:17.320
- Right.
- So I was...

01:34:20.698 --> 01:34:24.577
hurt, I suppose would be
the most accurate word.

01:34:24.702 --> 01:34:27.997
I'd been working, you know,
I don't know,

01:34:28.122 --> 01:34:30.624
four years, five years of my life,

01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:34.587
and not seeing my family
very much and stuff.

01:34:34.712 --> 01:34:37.173
And I just felt like

01:34:37.298 --> 01:34:40.134
there's nobody looking out
for me here, you know?

01:34:40.259 --> 01:34:41.427
Right. OK.

01:34:41.552 --> 01:34:47.850
So, I wanted them to do something,
and so we talked about it.

01:34:48.017 --> 01:34:51.145
<i>There's no question that
the directives came from him.</i>

01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:53.606
<i>Yet, when the SEC investigated,</i>

01:34:53.731 --> 01:34:56.984
it was as if he was immune.

01:34:58.027 --> 01:35:01.947
I'd wished they'd have come to me
and said,

01:35:02.073 --> 01:35:05.701
"Steve, we've got this new grant
for you,"

01:35:05.826 --> 01:35:08.704
without me having to suggest anything

01:35:08.829 --> 01:35:12.958
or be involved in anything
or negotiate anything.

01:35:13.084 --> 01:35:16.128
That would have been much better
from the company's point of view

01:35:16.253 --> 01:35:23.052
because it would have made me
feel better at that time.

01:35:24.887 --> 01:35:26.680
<i>According to one analyst,</i>

01:35:26.806 --> 01:35:28.766
<i>if Jobs had gone to jail
for backdating,</i>

01:35:28.891 --> 01:35:32.853
<i>the company's value would have
dropped by $22 billion.</i>

01:35:35.523 --> 01:35:37.983
<i>But Jobs was Apple's indispensable man,</i>

01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:43.364
<i>and Apple, Silicon Valley's
indispensable company.</i>

01:35:43.489 --> 01:35:46.992
<i>A cornerstone
of the entire American economy.</i>

01:35:47.118 --> 01:35:49.870
<i>But just how American was Apple?</i>

01:35:51.497 --> 01:35:54.250
Do you swear that the testimony
you're about to give will be...

01:35:54.375 --> 01:35:56.836
<i>When the US Senate
questioned Jobs's successor,</i>

01:35:57.002 --> 01:35:59.505
<i>Tim Cook,
about the company's tax practices,</i>

01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:03.092
<i>many of the subcommittee members
took a moment to state,</i>

01:36:03.217 --> 01:36:08.097
<i>for the record, just how tough
they were willing to be.</i>

01:36:08.222 --> 01:36:13.769
I love Apple, and I'm very proud
of Apple as an American company.

01:36:13.894 --> 01:36:17.314
Apple is an American success story.

01:36:17.523 --> 01:36:22.403
Its products are justifiably well-known
and used throughout the world.

01:36:22.528 --> 01:36:25.865
Just like millions around the world,
I carry an iPhone in my pocket.

01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:27.867
What may not be so well-known

01:36:28.033 --> 01:36:32.413
is that Apple also has a highly
developed tax-avoidance system,

01:36:32.538 --> 01:36:36.584
a system through which it has
amassed more than $100 billion

01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:39.628
in off-shore cash in a tax haven.

01:36:41.797 --> 01:36:45.176
<i>Apple found its tax haven
in the green fields of Ireland</i>

01:36:45.301 --> 01:36:49.305
<i>where Jobs and his team set up
holding companies in the early 1980s.</i>

01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:52.475
<i>The scheme is known as
a "Double Irish".</i>

01:36:53.684 --> 01:36:55.394
<i>Holly Hill industrial estate</i>

01:36:55.519 --> 01:36:58.230
<i>can scarcely be compared
to California's Silicon Valley.</i>

01:36:58.355 --> 01:37:02.568
<i>There is the feeling that Apple of Cork
may become something of a Silicon Hill.</i>

01:37:07.406 --> 01:37:12.953
<i>Today, Apple holds more than
$137 billion of its profits overseas.</i>

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:18.083
<i>Much of it in two small Irish
companies, one with no employees.</i>

01:37:18.209 --> 01:37:22.379
<i>While the actual cash is held
and invested by New York banks,</i>

01:37:22.505 --> 01:37:26.342
<i>the paper profits are steered
through an office park in Reno, Nevada,</i>

01:37:26.467 --> 01:37:31.263
<i>and then back to the Emerald Isle
where it's taxed at rates less than 1%.</i>

01:37:32.389 --> 01:37:34.600
Senator, we're proud
that all of our R&D,

01:37:34.725 --> 01:37:36.810
or the vast majority of it,
is in the United States.

01:37:36.936 --> 01:37:40.022
I know, but the profits that
result from it are sitting in Ireland

01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:43.859
in corporations that you control
that don't pay taxes.

01:37:44.026 --> 01:37:48.489
Part of the mythology
of these new companies

01:37:48.614 --> 01:37:53.702
<i>was that they in some way reflected
something about America.</i>

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:58.832
<i>Both Google and Apple
have played on the idea</i>

01:37:58.958 --> 01:38:02.253
<i>of political virtue as part
of selling their company.</i>

01:38:02.378 --> 01:38:09.176
So then to find out they weren't about
political virtue is distressing.

01:38:14.056 --> 01:38:19.019
<i>Steve Jobs said he wanted
to change the world, but into what?</i>

01:38:20.145 --> 01:38:23.774
<i>Companies all over the world
make choices on how to treat workers,</i>

01:38:23.899 --> 01:38:26.902
<i>what to give back
and where to put their money.</i>

01:38:27.027 --> 01:38:29.196
<i>What were Steve's choices?</i>

01:38:29.321 --> 01:38:32.449
<i>In meditation, he found simplicity.</i>

01:38:32.575 --> 01:38:38.205
<i>He loved the idea of "Be Here Now."
But where was "here?"</i>

01:38:39.748 --> 01:38:42.876
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have just landed</i>

01:38:43.002 --> 01:38:46.088
<i>at Beijing International Airport.</i>

01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:56.682
<i>I thought it was important
to cover China</i>

01:38:56.807 --> 01:39:01.270
because Apple has
all of its products made there.

01:39:01.395 --> 01:39:04.315
<i>I mean,
they design their own products,</i>

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.775
<i>but the manufacturing is done in China,</i>

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:10.779
<i>and so it's caught up in another
country's industrial revolution.</i>

01:39:10.904 --> 01:39:13.657
And a lot of that is
out of Apple's control.

01:39:19.663 --> 01:39:22.708
<i>Four workers died
and 77 were wounded</i>

01:39:22.833 --> 01:39:25.919
<i>in explosions
at two Apple supplier factories</i>

01:39:26.045 --> 01:39:28.130
<i>caused by careless safety procedures.</i>

01:39:29.506 --> 01:39:31.759
<i>The solvents used to sparkle
Apple's touch screens</i>

01:39:31.884 --> 01:39:35.387
<i>were powerful but dangerous,
causing nerve damage</i>

01:39:35.512 --> 01:39:39.433
<i>that led to weakness
and loss of touch in workers.</i>

01:39:39.558 --> 01:39:44.313
<i>They complained about low wages
and pressure to meet Apple's deadlines.</i>

01:39:45.356 --> 01:39:48.150
<i>In the Chinese factories
of many tech companies,</i>

01:39:48.317 --> 01:39:50.277
<i>copper, chromium
and other heavy metals</i>

01:39:50.402 --> 01:39:54.365
<i>saturate the run-off that flows
into local waterways.</i>

01:39:54.490 --> 01:39:56.659
<i>Sometimes chemical levels
are so high</i>

01:39:56.784 --> 01:39:59.620
<i>that sewage treatment plants
can't adequately clean the water</i>

01:39:59.745 --> 01:40:01.830
<i>for it ever to be used again.</i>

01:40:03.916 --> 01:40:09.421
<i>In 2010, Chinese activist Ma Jun
contacted all the tech manufacturers</i>

01:40:09.546 --> 01:40:13.509
<i>to discuss the issue
and even wrote to Jobs personally.</i>

01:40:13.634 --> 01:40:17.930
<i>All the companies ultimately responded
except one. Apple.</i>

01:40:18.055 --> 01:40:20.724
<i>It wasn't until Jobs left the company</i>

01:40:20.849 --> 01:40:24.061
<i>that Apple even agreed
to speak to Ma Jun.</i>

01:40:29.983 --> 01:40:32.277
<i>Foxconn is Apple's top supplier,</i>

01:40:32.403 --> 01:40:36.782
so it all goes downhill from there
in terms of the standards,

01:40:36.907 --> 01:40:38.492
in terms of everything.

01:40:40.536 --> 01:40:43.664
<i>These young people
come from the countryside</i>

01:40:43.789 --> 01:40:49.294
<i>under unimaginably poor conditions,
looking for a better life.</i>

01:40:54.174 --> 01:40:56.927
<i>Sun Danyong, nicknamed Yong,</i>

01:40:57.052 --> 01:40:59.847
<i>came to Foxconn
from a small mountain village.</i>

01:41:02.474 --> 01:41:04.685
<i>Placed in the product
communications department,</i>

01:41:04.810 --> 01:41:08.188
<i>he was responsible for the security
of iPhone prototypes</i>

01:41:08.439 --> 01:41:10.941
<i>bound for Apple's headquarters
in Silicon Valley.</i>

01:41:11.066 --> 01:41:17.364
<i>In 2009, an iPhone 4 prototype
went missing on Yong's watch.</i>

01:41:24.747 --> 01:41:28.500
<i>Sun Danyong was
the first factory worker</i>

01:41:28.625 --> 01:41:31.044
<i>who came under the spotlight.</i>

01:41:31.170 --> 01:41:37.384
What makes his story incredibly vivid
is that in today's day and age,

01:41:37.509 --> 01:41:41.054
there's CCTV cameras recording
where his movements were.

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:45.809
<i>He had a conversation with his friends
on the Chinese Twitter site,</i>

01:41:45.934 --> 01:41:49.855
and you could really track
what had happened.

01:41:50.856 --> 01:41:53.025
<i>Yong searched
high and low for the prototype</i>

01:41:53.233 --> 01:41:56.403
<i>before reporting it missing
to Foxconn security.</i>

01:41:57.112 --> 01:42:00.282
<i>That evening, officials took him
into an interrogation room</i>

01:42:00.449 --> 01:42:01.909
<i>where he was assaulted</i>

01:42:02.034 --> 01:42:05.621
<i>and was told police would arrive
the next morning to question him.</i>

01:42:06.663 --> 01:42:10.959
<i>Yong was finally permitted
to leave the factory at 10:41pm.</i>

01:42:11.084 --> 01:42:13.462
<i>He wandered to an internet cafe</i>

01:42:13.587 --> 01:42:16.799
<i>where he chatted online
with his friends.</i>

01:42:32.773 --> 01:42:35.651
<i>He logged off
around 1:30 in the morning.</i>

01:42:37.027 --> 01:42:39.905
<i>Soon after, security cameras
spotted him in an elevator</i>

01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:42.825
<i>in his apartment complex.</i>

01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:46.203
<i>He got out on the 12th floor
and texted his girlfriend.</i>

01:43:02.928 --> 01:43:09.726
<i>At 3:33am, security cameras recorded
Sun Danyong jumping to his death.</i>

01:43:15.649 --> 01:43:19.528
<i>Over a period of two years or so,
there were 18 suicides.</i>

01:43:19.653 --> 01:43:24.992
Foxconn set up these nets
to catch people who fall off.

01:43:25.117 --> 01:43:27.411
<i>People were jumping
off of the buildings,</i>

01:43:27.536 --> 01:43:29.830
<i>so they were going to
prevent people from dying</i>

01:43:29.955 --> 01:43:33.000
<i>by having safety nets to catch them.</i>

01:43:38.964 --> 01:43:41.800
You know, they've had,
if you count the attempted suicides,

01:43:41.925 --> 01:43:43.886
13 so far this year.

01:43:44.011 --> 01:43:49.725
And while that is still...
They have 400,000 people at this place.

01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:53.854
So, 13 out of 400,000
is 26 per year so far.

01:43:53.979 --> 01:44:00.110
For 400,000 people or, you know,
let's say seven per 100,000 people,

01:44:00.235 --> 01:44:04.323
that's still under the US suicide rate
of 11 per 100,000 people,

01:44:04.489 --> 01:44:06.116
but it's really troubling.

01:44:06.241 --> 01:44:08.160
Right. It's in one place, too.

01:44:08.285 --> 01:44:10.704
Well, you measure it
by number of people.

01:44:10.913 --> 01:44:14.833
You measure it by numbers of people.
So, we're all over this.

01:44:14.958 --> 01:44:18.712
And it's... It's very troubling.

01:44:18.837 --> 01:44:22.341
So, we're over there trying
to understand what's happening,

01:44:22.507 --> 01:44:25.010
and more importantly,
trying to understand how we can help.

01:44:31.016 --> 01:44:34.728
<i>Apple isn't the only company
to manufacture in China,</i>

01:44:34.895 --> 01:44:38.815
<i>but it is different in one way.
Its enormous profit margin.</i>

01:44:38.941 --> 01:44:43.028
<i>The profit on every iPhone 4
was over $300.</i>

01:44:43.195 --> 01:44:48.116
<i>Yet Apple paid its Chinese workforce
less than $12 per phone.</i>

01:44:48.241 --> 01:44:51.954
<i>If Jobs had really "thought different,"
shouldn't he have cared more</i>

01:44:52.079 --> 01:44:53.914
<i>about the people
who touched the iPhones</i>

01:44:54.039 --> 01:44:58.043
<i>before they appeared in
the hands of Apple's customers?</i>

01:45:06.134 --> 01:45:09.972
<i>When I was writing
critical stories about Apple,</i>

01:45:10.097 --> 01:45:13.266
the mail would be 80% hate mail.

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:21.149
<i>Even the most reasoned,
judicious criticism</i>

01:45:21.274 --> 01:45:27.406
<i>about labor practices in China,
for crying out loud, it didn't matter.</i>

01:45:27.572 --> 01:45:30.075
<i>People didn't want to hear it.</i>

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.954
<i>They loved this company.
They loved its products.</i>

01:45:34.079 --> 01:45:37.708
<i>They loved the status symbol
of having these things in their hand</i>

01:45:37.833 --> 01:45:41.253
<i>and looking at it all the time,
and it just felt cool,</i>

01:45:41.378 --> 01:45:46.133
<i>and they'd stood in line for two days
to buy one,</i>

01:45:46.258 --> 01:45:48.677
<i>and they didn't want to hear it.</i>

01:45:54.433 --> 01:45:57.769
<i>I was one of those people
who had to have an iPhone.</i>

01:45:57.894 --> 01:46:00.605
<i>I didn't want
to hear about other products,</i>

01:46:00.731 --> 01:46:02.482
<i>and I believed against all reason</i>

01:46:02.649 --> 01:46:06.028
<i>that owning an iPhone made me
part of something better.</i>

01:46:06.153 --> 01:46:09.990
<i>And when it was in my pocket,
for every idle moment,</i>

01:46:10.115 --> 01:46:14.536
<i>my hand was drawn to it,
like Frodo's hand to the ring.</i>

01:46:15.412 --> 01:46:18.415
<i>The real magic of it
is that these myths</i>

01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:24.004
<i>are surrounding a company
that makes phones.</i>

01:46:25.505 --> 01:46:27.924
A phone is not a mythical device.

01:46:29.092 --> 01:46:31.094
Um...

01:46:31.219 --> 01:46:38.852
And it sort of makes you wonder
less about Apple than about us.

01:46:40.562 --> 01:46:43.857
<i>The myth-making
around technology in general</i>

01:46:43.982 --> 01:46:50.864
<i>allows the technologist to do things
that would be viewed as heinous</i>

01:46:50.989 --> 01:46:54.159
<i>if they were done
by other kinds of companies.</i>

01:46:56.161 --> 01:46:58.413
<i>This is a story that's amazing.</i>

01:46:58.538 --> 01:47:03.043
<i>It's got theft, it's got buying
stolen property, it's got extortion.</i>

01:47:03.168 --> 01:47:05.837
I'm sure there's sex
in there somewhere, you know?

01:47:05.962 --> 01:47:07.339
Really?

01:47:07.464 --> 01:47:10.467
So somebody should make
a movie out of this.

01:47:10.592 --> 01:47:13.053
<i>If you were to make a movie
about it,</i>

01:47:13.178 --> 01:47:16.681
<i>the first scene would be set in
a beer garden in Silicon Valley.</i>

01:47:16.807 --> 01:47:19.601
<i>As he swilled a few steins of Pilsner,</i>

01:47:19.768 --> 01:47:23.230
<i>Apple's Gray Powell was testing out
a new iPhone prototype.</i>

01:47:25.107 --> 01:47:28.610
<i>But when Powell staggered
out of the bar, he forgot one thing.</i>

01:47:28.777 --> 01:47:30.529
<i>The iPhone.</i>

01:47:30.695 --> 01:47:35.826
<i>It was found on a bar stool
by a college student named Brian Hogan.</i>

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.079
<i>And this e-mail
comes into our tip box,</i>

01:47:39.204 --> 01:47:43.542
and there was this guy claiming
that he had this new iPhone prototype.

01:47:43.708 --> 01:47:47.879
<i>Getting inside Apple's security fort,</i>

01:47:48.004 --> 01:47:50.465
<i>and look at something
that is under wrap.</i>

01:47:50.590 --> 01:47:54.427
But back then, when Steve Jobs was
at the helm and in his full power,

01:47:54.553 --> 01:47:56.555
it was impossible
to get anything from them.

01:47:56.721 --> 01:47:58.640
It was incredibly exciting.

01:47:58.807 --> 01:48:01.726
At that point, Apple didn't have
a whole lot of leaks.

01:48:01.852 --> 01:48:04.855
And then I go to Nick and I say,

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:08.066
"We think it's the real thing,
and they want their money."

01:48:08.191 --> 01:48:10.193
And Nick said, "Anything you want."

01:48:10.318 --> 01:48:14.114
For us, there's no question
as to whether we write the story or not.

01:48:14.239 --> 01:48:17.409
That's what was so disturbing,
I think, to Steve Jobs,

01:48:17.534 --> 01:48:19.786
was that he'd been used to having

01:48:19.911 --> 01:48:22.330
a much more controlled
relationship with the press.

01:48:22.455 --> 01:48:25.167
Our plan was to take pictures of it,

01:48:25.292 --> 01:48:28.503
write about it,
and then return it back to Apple.

01:48:28.628 --> 01:48:31.173
Hey, I'm Jason Chen.
This is the new iPhone.

01:48:31.298 --> 01:48:33.341
Here are some of the new features.

01:48:33.466 --> 01:48:36.887
<i>In the beginning, it was OK.
Only nerds looking at it, I guess.</i>

01:48:37.012 --> 01:48:38.430
And then the story
started to pick up.

01:48:40.515 --> 01:48:43.852
You know, it was the biggest
scoop in tech in history.

01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:49.316
"Hi, this is Steve Jobs.
I want my phone back."

01:48:49.441 --> 01:48:51.568
And it was
in a really charming voice.

01:48:51.693 --> 01:48:55.947
And it's same way you'd ask for,
you know, a hat you'd lent a friend.

01:48:56.072 --> 01:49:00.785
<i>I'd met him a couple of times before.
It was his voice, unmistakably.</i>

01:49:00.911 --> 01:49:02.412
He said, "You know, I'm not mad at you."

01:49:02.537 --> 01:49:04.581
"It's someone we worked with
who lost it."

01:49:04.706 --> 01:49:06.708
"But you've had your fun,
and we need this phone back

01:49:06.875 --> 01:49:08.501
before it gets into the wrong hands."

01:49:08.627 --> 01:49:12.130
And at that point, I was thinking,
"Isn't it already in the wrong hands?"

01:49:17.552 --> 01:49:21.890
Nick at that moment said,
"Ask for a letter."

01:49:22.015 --> 01:49:24.017
"Ask for an official letter
asking for it."

01:49:24.142 --> 01:49:26.686
"We need the actual confirmation
that this is the real thing."

01:49:26.895 --> 01:49:29.940
<i>The next call,
he said he didn't want to claim it.</i>

01:49:30.065 --> 01:49:32.234
<i>He really changed his tone
at that point,</i>

01:49:32.359 --> 01:49:34.986
<i>because it would affect
the sales of the current model,</i>

01:49:35.195 --> 01:49:36.905
which is kind of disappointing,
you know?

01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:39.532
You hear all these stories about
this guy not caring about money.

01:49:39.658 --> 01:49:42.077
<i>And he goes,
"This is some serious shit."</i>

01:49:42.202 --> 01:49:45.121
<i>"If I have to serve you papers,
I'm coming for something,</i>

01:49:45.247 --> 01:49:48.083
<i>and it's going to mean someone in your
organization is going to go to jail."</i>

01:49:48.208 --> 01:49:51.294
For a reporter who's got a chip
on his shoulder against corporations,

01:49:51.419 --> 01:49:55.048
that's like,
"Martyr me. Please, martyr me."

01:49:55.173 --> 01:49:59.261
"I'll go to jail for an iPhone.
Like, really."

01:49:59.386 --> 01:50:03.223
<i>He called back later and he said,
"OK, we'll get you the letter,"</i>

01:50:03.348 --> 01:50:05.558
<i>and he was just resigned and cold.</i>

01:50:05.684 --> 01:50:08.728
<i>So, they sent us the letter,
and they sent a lawyer from Apple</i>

01:50:08.895 --> 01:50:11.231
to Jason's house to pick up the phone.

01:50:11.356 --> 01:50:13.566
It was a very cold exchange.

01:50:13.733 --> 01:50:16.278
He said, "I believe you have
something of mine," or something.

01:50:16.403 --> 01:50:19.489
And I handed it to him, and he said,
"Thank you very much," and he left.

01:50:19.614 --> 01:50:22.492
Was that the end of it,
as far as Apple was concerned?

01:50:22.617 --> 01:50:23.952
No, of course not.

01:50:24.077 --> 01:50:27.706
Then all the nightmares started.

01:50:54.774 --> 01:50:58.528
The cops had to bash in the guy's door?

01:50:58.653 --> 01:51:01.948
Don't they know there's an app for that?

01:51:02.073 --> 01:51:04.451
<i>Anyone who'd worked
with Jobs before</i>

01:51:04.576 --> 01:51:07.704
would know of other instances
where he'd been a bully.

01:51:07.829 --> 01:51:10.623
But this was probably
the most public evidence of bullying.

01:51:11.833 --> 01:51:15.462
<i>My wife and I went out for dinner.
We came back home,</i>

01:51:15.587 --> 01:51:18.131
<i>and we noticed the garage door
was slightly opened.</i>

01:51:18.256 --> 01:51:21.634
You know, and I was wondering,
"What's going on?"

01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:24.512
<i>And I opened it all the way,
and I noticed there were people inside.</i>

01:51:24.679 --> 01:51:28.183
<i>And I thought, you know,
"Holy crap, I'm being robbed."</i>

01:51:28.308 --> 01:51:30.769
And then I looked closer
and realized it was cops.

01:51:33.063 --> 01:51:35.774
<i>The cops seized boxes
of Chen's personal property</i>

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:38.693
<i>including four computers,
two cellphones</i>

01:51:38.818 --> 01:51:41.404
<i>and a box of his business cards.</i>

01:51:43.156 --> 01:51:48.203
<i>For the Gizmodo movie, this raised
questions of plot and motivation.</i>

01:51:48.328 --> 01:51:53.249
<i>Why break down Chen's door
after he returned the iPhone?</i>

01:51:53.375 --> 01:51:57.420
<i>They showed me the warrant
to search the premises and said,</i>

01:51:57.545 --> 01:51:59.339
"We're part of the REACT team."

01:51:59.464 --> 01:52:02.592
<i>After they searched the house,
obviously I went and Googled it.</i>

01:52:02.717 --> 01:52:04.761
<i>The officers
who raided Chen's apartment</i>

01:52:04.886 --> 01:52:08.431
<i>were part of a little-known criminal
task force called REACT,</i>

01:52:08.556 --> 01:52:11.768
<i>composed of local, state
and federal officials</i>

01:52:11.893 --> 01:52:15.397
<i>on the lookout for corporate espionage
in Silicon Valley.</i>

01:52:17.399 --> 01:52:20.318
My initial response was,
"This is cool. It's Apple."

01:52:21.403 --> 01:52:23.196
<i>Chris Feasel
was the deputy DA</i>

01:52:23.321 --> 01:52:25.865
<i>advising REACTon the case.</i>

01:52:26.032 --> 01:52:28.034
<i>After the raid on Chen's apartment,</i>

01:52:28.159 --> 01:52:31.496
<i>Feasel was received at Apple
by Jobs himself.</i>

01:52:31.621 --> 01:52:35.667
He was very, very nice,
very high-energy.

01:52:36.626 --> 01:52:39.712
<i>We had a back-and-forth about
what he wanted to see happen</i>

01:52:39.838 --> 01:52:42.340
<i>versus what some of the realities were
about doing a prosecution.</i>

01:52:42.465 --> 01:52:46.594
He was very supportive about whatever
choices that we made on the case.

01:52:46.719 --> 01:52:48.763
Where do people
come down on this?

01:52:48.888 --> 01:52:51.808
- Where do you come down on it?
- Well, I can just tell you what...

01:52:51.933 --> 01:52:58.273
There is an ongoing investigation
by the DA, and I'm not current on it.

01:52:58.398 --> 01:53:01.943
He was very involved in it
and very interested in it

01:53:02.068 --> 01:53:03.653
and wanted to be kept abreast

01:53:03.778 --> 01:53:06.030
about what was going on
in the investigation.

01:53:06.948 --> 01:53:10.452
<i>Jobs had every reason to
expect that he would be kept informed</i>

01:53:10.577 --> 01:53:13.621
<i>because REACT wasn't
a purely government agency.</i>

01:53:13.746 --> 01:53:15.081
<i>It had a steering committee</i>

01:53:15.248 --> 01:53:19.210
<i>composed of many of the major
companies in the Valley.</i>

01:53:19.377 --> 01:53:22.797
<i>In a town so completely dominated
by the tech industry,</i>

01:53:22.922 --> 01:53:25.300
<i>had law enforcement become the muscle</i>

01:53:25.425 --> 01:53:27.844
<i>for the largest corporations
in the world?</i>

01:53:31.264 --> 01:53:38.354
<i>He was very, very adamant
and very passionate about his creation.</i>

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:42.150
And the only analogy I can think of is
if somebody stole your baby,

01:53:42.317 --> 01:53:44.194
you would be very upset about it.

01:53:44.402 --> 01:53:48.865
<i>That's how Mr Jobs felt.
Somebody had taken his baby.</i>

01:53:51.367 --> 01:53:53.328
<i>In spite of pressure
from Apple,</i>

01:53:53.453 --> 01:53:56.456
<i>the DA decided
not to pursue the charges against Chen</i>

01:53:56.581 --> 01:53:59.250
<i>because he hadn't received
stolen property.</i>

01:53:59.375 --> 01:54:01.586
<i>He was a journalist doing a story.</i>

01:54:02.962 --> 01:54:06.799
When this whole thing
with Gizmodo happened,

01:54:06.925 --> 01:54:11.721
I got a lot of advice
from people that said,

01:54:11.846 --> 01:54:18.144
"You shouldn't go after a journalist
because they bought stolen property,

01:54:18.269 --> 01:54:22.565
and they tried to extort you.
You should let it slide."

01:54:22.690 --> 01:54:27.111
"Apple's a big company now.
You don't want the PR."

01:54:27.237 --> 01:54:29.197
"You should let it slide."

01:54:29.322 --> 01:54:34.494
And I thought deeply about this,
and I ended up concluding

01:54:34.619 --> 01:54:37.705
that the worst thing
that could possibly happen

01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:42.335
as we get big and we get
a little more influence in the world,

01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:48.883
is if we change our core values
and start letting it slide.

01:54:49.050 --> 01:54:53.221
I can't do that. I'd rather quit.

01:54:54.305 --> 01:54:57.350
<i>What values
was Jobs talking about?</i>

01:54:57.475 --> 01:55:02.480
<i>When Apple was taking on IBM,
it was David versus Goliath.</i>

01:55:02.647 --> 01:55:08.027
<i>But when Apple became Goliath,
to whom was Jobs giving the finger?</i>

01:55:12.657 --> 01:55:17.495
<i>The sad thing is that how many
months did he have left after that?</i>

01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:23.001
This was a guy who knew,
who knew at the time,

01:55:23.167 --> 01:55:30.174
he was dying, and he dedicated,
what, ten minutes of his life

01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:33.344
to talk about these guys
who found a phone in a bar

01:55:33.469 --> 01:55:38.266
and then published a story about it?
Isn't that a little bit strange?

01:55:41.436 --> 01:55:45.023
My third story is about death.

01:55:46.065 --> 01:55:50.069
About a year ago,
I was diagnosed with cancer.

01:55:50.236 --> 01:55:52.238
I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning,

01:55:52.363 --> 01:55:55.450
and it clearly showed
a tumor on my pancreas.

01:55:55.575 --> 01:55:57.577
I didn't even know
what a pancreas was.

01:55:57.702 --> 01:55:59.287
The doctors told me

01:55:59.412 --> 01:56:03.416
this was almost certainly
a type of cancer that is incurable,

01:56:03.541 --> 01:56:07.629
and that I should expect to live
no longer than three to six months.

01:56:07.754 --> 01:56:12.342
My doctor advised me to go home
and get my affairs in order,

01:56:12.508 --> 01:56:15.845
which is doctor's code
for "prepare to die."

01:56:15.970 --> 01:56:17.764
It means to try and tell your kids

01:56:17.889 --> 01:56:21.726
everything you thought you'd have
the next ten years to tell them

01:56:21.851 --> 01:56:23.311
in just a few months.

01:56:23.436 --> 01:56:28.608
I lived with that diagnosis all day.
Later that evening, I had a biopsy.

01:56:28.733 --> 01:56:32.070
I was sedated, but my wife,
who was there,

01:56:32.278 --> 01:56:35.448
told me that when they viewed the cells
under a microscope,

01:56:35.573 --> 01:56:38.284
the doctors started crying
because it turned out to be

01:56:38.409 --> 01:56:42.747
a very rare form of pancreatic cancer
that is curable with surgery.

01:56:42.872 --> 01:56:46.501
I had the surgery
and, thankfully, I'm fine now.

01:56:50.129 --> 01:56:52.840
<i>Steve Jobs talked about
his cancer very emotionally</i>

01:56:52.965 --> 01:56:56.552
<i>at the Stanford graduation ceremony
in 2005.</i>

01:56:56.678 --> 01:56:58.680
And he very clearly told the story

01:56:58.805 --> 01:57:01.349
to make it sound as though
he had been diagnosed

01:57:01.516 --> 01:57:04.310
and moved immediately to surgery,
and been cured.

01:57:04.435 --> 01:57:05.728
That simply wasn't true.

01:57:05.853 --> 01:57:09.440
<i>What I found out, over a period
of months of reporting,</i>

01:57:09.565 --> 01:57:12.318
<i>was that Steve Jobs actually
had been diagnosed with cancer</i>

01:57:12.443 --> 01:57:16.197
<i>nine months earlier, and that
for a period of nine months,</i>

01:57:16.364 --> 01:57:19.826
<i>he had refused to have the surgery
that every medical expert said</i>

01:57:19.951 --> 01:57:22.620
<i>was necessary to increase
his prospects for survival.</i>

01:57:22.745 --> 01:57:24.747
Instead of having the surgery,

01:57:24.872 --> 01:57:28.584
he had sought
alternative medicine approaches

01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:30.795
to try to cure himself of cancer.

01:57:31.963 --> 01:57:34.716
<i>Entrepreneurs have
an almost pathological need</i>

01:57:34.841 --> 01:57:36.759
<i>to control their own fate.</i>

01:57:36.884 --> 01:57:38.177
<i>They'll take any suffering</i>

01:57:38.302 --> 01:57:40.138
if they can just be in charge
of their destiny

01:57:40.304 --> 01:57:42.306
and not have it
in somebody else's hands.

01:57:42.432 --> 01:57:47.520
<i>Apple's stock has been
volatile on rumors about Jobs's health.</i>

01:57:47.645 --> 01:57:49.856
The company's stock
was halted for a time,

01:57:49.981 --> 01:57:53.693
then took a big hit when it re-opened
in after-hours trading.

01:57:53.818 --> 01:57:55.778
<i>Apple's share prices have dropped</i>

01:57:55.903 --> 01:57:58.823
<i>with every pound
that Jobs has lost in recent months.</i>

01:58:00.199 --> 01:58:02.660
<i>Apple really landed
into a dicey situation</i>

01:58:02.785 --> 01:58:04.620
<i>when Steve decided
to issue a letter saying,</i>

01:58:04.746 --> 01:58:06.622
<i>"Well, you know,
nothing's wrong with me."</i>

01:58:06.748 --> 01:58:09.250
"It's just a minor problem,"
And it wasn't a minor problem.

01:58:10.668 --> 01:58:14.172
<i>Steve Jobs made a point
of withholding from the world</i>

01:58:14.338 --> 01:58:16.799
<i>that he faced this illness.</i>

01:58:16.924 --> 01:58:18.718
<i>That's something
investors want to know,</i>

01:58:18.843 --> 01:58:20.553
<i>because when you
bought Apple stock then,</i>

01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:22.638
you were buying into Steve Jobs.

01:58:22.805 --> 01:58:26.225
He was obligated
to tell shareholders right away

01:58:26.350 --> 01:58:27.852
about this serious illness.

01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:31.731
<i>You do personally
want to give Steve the privacy,</i>

01:58:31.856 --> 01:58:34.817
<i>but Steve put the spotlight on him,</i>

01:58:34.942 --> 01:58:38.738
and you can't turn that off
just because it's inconvenient.

01:58:41.616 --> 01:58:44.368
<i>After the story came out,
I saw Steve.</i>

01:58:44.494 --> 01:58:47.079
He started talking about Apple,
and he said,

01:58:47.205 --> 01:58:51.459
<i>"You know, Apple is really a company
that doesn't have any divisions."</i>

01:58:51.584 --> 01:58:53.711
<i>"We don't have all this bureaucracy."</i>

01:58:53.836 --> 01:58:56.756
And I said, "Steve, that would be
a great story for <i>Fortune."</i>

01:58:56.881 --> 01:59:02.512
And he looked at me, and he said,
"No."

01:59:02.637 --> 01:59:08.392
"I don't think we can do that story
with you. Not now."

01:59:09.977 --> 01:59:11.604
"Not now."

01:59:11.813 --> 01:59:15.733
And then he said,
and the whole room went quiet,

01:59:15.858 --> 01:59:19.821
and he said, "you know, we used to..."

01:59:21.155 --> 01:59:24.700
"We used to really be friends
with <i>Fortune,</i>

01:59:24.826 --> 01:59:31.791
I used to be friends with <i>Fortune,</i>
but not anymore. Not anymore."

01:59:31.916 --> 01:59:35.461
And then I remember these tears
came out of his eyes,

01:59:35.586 --> 01:59:37.046
and one was on his glasses,

01:59:37.171 --> 01:59:41.676
and then one, I remember it rolling
off his cheek and hitting his shirt,

01:59:41.801 --> 01:59:46.848
and he was just crying,
and the whole room was silent.

01:59:48.891 --> 01:59:52.603
Apple CEO Steve Jobs today
made his first public appearance

01:59:52.728 --> 01:59:54.605
since getting a new liver
five months ago.

01:59:54.730 --> 01:59:55.857
<i>For the first time,</i>

01:59:55.982 --> 01:59:58.901
<i>the 54-year-old CEO
publicly acknowledged</i>

01:59:59.026 --> 02:00:02.488
<i>the liver transplant this spring
that saved his life.</i>

02:00:02.613 --> 02:00:08.244
Well, I now have the liver
of a mid-20s person.

02:00:11.873 --> 02:00:16.502
I'd like to take a moment and thank
everybody in the Apple community

02:00:16.627 --> 02:00:20.840
for the heartfelt support I got, too.
It really meant a lot.

02:00:20.965 --> 02:00:25.845
And I'd also like
to especially thank Tim Cook

02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:29.682
and the entire executive team of Apple.

02:00:29.807 --> 02:00:32.226
They really rose to the occasion

02:00:32.351 --> 02:00:36.480
and ran the company very ably
in that difficult period.

02:00:36.606 --> 02:00:38.941
So, thank you, guys.
Let's give them a round of applause.

02:00:40.484 --> 02:00:42.069
<i>He loved what he did.</i>

02:00:42.194 --> 02:00:44.238
I do have an e-mail from him
saying that.

02:00:44.363 --> 02:00:46.866
<i>He said, you know,
"Both of us were fortunate," he said,</i>

02:00:46.991 --> 02:00:49.368
<i>in that we loved what we did</i>

02:00:49.535 --> 02:00:52.288
<i>and we were able to do it
for a long time.</i>

02:00:52.413 --> 02:00:54.832
<i>And he said,
"What else could you ask for?"</i>

02:00:56.208 --> 02:01:00.922
We're maybe a little more experienced,
certainly more beat-up,

02:01:01.047 --> 02:01:04.759
but the core values are the same.

02:01:04.884 --> 02:01:09.513
I don't see why you have to change
if you get big.

02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:11.891
<i>Straightforward to me.</i>

02:01:12.016 --> 02:01:14.352
<i>Apple was big.</i>

02:01:14.518 --> 02:01:18.814
<i>By this time, one of the biggest
corporations in the world.</i>

02:01:21.275 --> 02:01:24.862
<i>But each time we saw Jobs,
he seemed smaller.</i>

02:01:28.366 --> 02:01:32.286
<i>As his devices got stronger,
Jobs got weaker.</i>

02:01:32.411 --> 02:01:35.915
It's so much more intimate
than a laptop,

02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:39.293
and it's so much more capable
than a smartphone

02:01:39.418 --> 02:01:41.253
with this gorgeous, large display.

02:01:41.379 --> 02:01:45.174
<i>I think that a lot of the grief
at Jobs's death</i>

02:01:45.299 --> 02:01:50.471
was a fear that we had been
very comfortable

02:01:50.638 --> 02:01:52.974
<i>for the last decade in his hands.</i>

02:01:53.099 --> 02:01:57.770
It's phenomenal to hold the internet
in your hand.

02:01:57.895 --> 02:02:00.189
<i>That he was going to keep
doing these amazing things.</i>

02:02:00.314 --> 02:02:04.276
Now he's gone, and there's no indication
that anyone's going to replace him.

02:02:36.976 --> 02:02:38.728
Welcome.

02:02:44.692 --> 02:02:46.068
Thank you.

02:02:58.456 --> 02:03:00.166
Thank you very much.

02:03:03.961 --> 02:03:05.546
- It always helps...
- We love you!

02:03:05.713 --> 02:03:09.300
Thank you.

02:03:09.508 --> 02:03:12.803
It always helps,
and I appreciate it very much.

02:03:12.928 --> 02:03:16.849
<i>He resigned officially
in August. Two weeks earlier,</i>

02:03:16.974 --> 02:03:20.478
<i>Apple had become the highest-valued
corporation on Earth.</i>

02:03:20.644 --> 02:03:22.271
And thank you for coming so much.

02:03:22.396 --> 02:03:24.982
<i>We've got a great week
planned for you.</i>

02:03:49.924 --> 02:03:52.927
<i>This is a field
where one does not write a principia</i>

02:03:53.052 --> 02:03:55.638
<i>which holds up for 200 years</i>

02:03:55.763 --> 02:03:58.099
<i>or paints a painting that'll be
looked at for centuries,</i>

02:03:58.224 --> 02:04:01.936
<i>or builds a church
that will be admired</i>

02:04:02.061 --> 02:04:03.979
<i>and looked at in astonishment
for centuries.</i>

02:04:04.105 --> 02:04:06.440
No, this is a field
where one does one's work,

02:04:06.565 --> 02:04:08.484
and in ten years, it's obsolete

02:04:08.609 --> 02:04:11.237
and really will not be useable
within ten or 20 years.

02:04:11.362 --> 02:04:13.280
I mean, you can't go back
and use an Apple I,

02:04:13.405 --> 02:04:14.573
cos there's no software for it.

02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:17.201
In another ten years or so,
you won't be able to use an Apple II.

02:04:17.326 --> 02:04:19.787
You won't even be able to fire it up
and see what it was like.

02:04:21.539 --> 02:04:25.000
<i>It's sort of like
sediment of rocks.</i>

02:04:25.126 --> 02:04:26.836
<i>You're building up a mountain,</i>

02:04:26.961 --> 02:04:30.131
<i>and you get to contribute
your little layer of sedimentary rock</i>

02:04:30.256 --> 02:04:32.258
<i>to make the mountain that much higher.</i>

02:04:32.383 --> 02:04:35.970
<i>But no one on the surface will,
unless they have x-ray vision,</i>

02:04:36.137 --> 02:04:37.847
<i>will see your sediment.</i>

02:04:41.267 --> 02:04:44.687
<i>In Japan, there's
an idea called "mono no aware,"</i>

02:04:44.812 --> 02:04:48.149
<i>meaning "the deep awareness of things".</i>

02:04:48.274 --> 02:04:51.235
<i>It celebrates the melancholy
of the passing of life</i>

02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:55.156
<i>and sees more beauty in the fallen leaf
than the one on the branch.</i>

02:04:56.407 --> 02:04:59.326
<i>Maybe that's what Japan held for Jobs.</i>

02:04:59.451 --> 02:05:04.331
<i>The sadness of the soul
as expressed in the beauty of things.</i>

02:05:09.253 --> 02:05:11.881
<i>In the end, I was left
with the same question</i>

02:05:12.006 --> 02:05:13.549
<i>with which I began this journey.</i>

02:05:13.674 --> 02:05:18.220
<i>"Why did so many strangers weep
for Steve Jobs?"</i>

02:05:18.345 --> 02:05:21.640
<i>It's too simple to say it was
because he gave us products we love</i>

02:05:21.807 --> 02:05:25.686
<i>without asking why we love them
the way we do.</i>

02:05:25.853 --> 02:05:28.063
<i>It's too simple even to conclude
that we love them</i>

02:05:28.230 --> 02:05:30.357
<i>because they connect us
to a wider world</i>

02:05:30.482 --> 02:05:33.611
<i>and the people in our lives
that are far away,</i>

02:05:33.777 --> 02:05:37.114
<i>because these machines isolate us, too.</i>

02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:43.579
<i>Perhaps the contradictory nature
of our experience with these gadgets</i>

02:05:43.704 --> 02:05:46.290
<i>mirrors the contradictions
in Jobs himself.</i>

02:05:48.667 --> 02:05:52.713
<i>He was an artist who sought perfection,
but could never find peace.</i>

02:05:54.965 --> 02:05:58.844
<i>He had the focus of a monk,
but none of the empathy.</i>

02:06:01.096 --> 02:06:04.808
<i>He offered us freedom,
but only within a closed garden,</i>

02:06:04.934 --> 02:06:07.061
<i>to which he held the key.</i>

02:06:11.315 --> 02:06:13.317
<i>To reconcile these contradictions,</i>

02:06:13.442 --> 02:06:17.196
<i>I think we have to look to the other
half of our relationship with Jobs.</i>

02:06:17.321 --> 02:06:18.989
<i>To ourselves.</i>

02:06:22.243 --> 02:06:26.455
<i>As Jobs wanted it,
the screen of my iPhone is dark.</i>

02:06:26.622 --> 02:06:29.208
<i>A Zen landscape of the unseen.</i>

02:06:29.333 --> 02:06:34.296
<i>If I stare into it, I see
an obscure reflection of myself,</i>

02:06:34.421 --> 02:06:37.049
<i>but this impression
lasts just a fleeting moment</i>

02:06:37.174 --> 02:06:40.761
<i>before I press the home key
and the screen lights up.</i>

02:06:40.928 --> 02:06:44.765
<i>But perhaps I should spend a moment
regarding that reflection,</i>

02:06:44.932 --> 02:06:50.938
<i>asking myself what, in buying
and using this product, I am doing?</i>

02:06:51.063 --> 02:06:53.565
<i>What is the full nature
of my transaction</i>

02:06:53.732 --> 02:06:58.153
<i>with the maker of this magical
and intimate machine?</i>

02:07:18.799 --> 02:07:24.972
<i># Once I wanted to be the greatest</i>

02:07:25.097 --> 02:07:27.391
<i># Greatest, greatest, greatest</i>

02:07:27.516 --> 02:07:33.355
<i># No wind or waterfall could stall me</i>

02:07:34.773 --> 02:07:40.446
<i># And then came the rush of the flood</i>

02:07:40.612 --> 02:07:45.826
<i># Stars at night turned deep to dust</i>

02:07:45.993 --> 02:07:51.457
<i># Melt me down into big, black armor</i>

02:07:54.543 --> 02:08:01.467
<i># Leave no trace of grace
Just in your honor</i>

02:08:03.677 --> 02:08:09.391
<i># Lower me down to culprit south</i>

02:08:09.516 --> 02:08:13.103
<i># Make 'em wash a space in town</i>

02:08:13.228 --> 02:08:17.232
<i># For the lead and the dregs of my bed</i>

02:08:17.358 --> 02:08:20.819
<i># I've been sleeping</i>

02:08:20.986 --> 02:08:23.822
<i># Lower me down</i>

02:08:23.989 --> 02:08:28.327
<i># Pin me in, secure the grounds</i>

02:08:30.371 --> 02:08:31.997
<i># For the later parade</i>

02:08:34.541 --> 02:08:37.503
