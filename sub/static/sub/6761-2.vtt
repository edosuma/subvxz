01:09.027 --> 01:10.820
Brandon.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.323
Brandon.

01:15.074 --> 01:16.367
Come on.

01:17.285 --> 01:21.164
Brandon, wake up.
We have school in 16 minutes.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.130
Dream on.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.175
<i>Wake up!</i>

01:32.675 --> 01:34.343
<i>Wake up!</i>

01:34.886 --> 01:36.679
<i>Wake up!</i>

03:13.025 --> 03:15.569
I'm sorry, but our deal was
you weren't gonna travel,

03:15.652 --> 03:17.738
and I wasn't gonna gripe.

03:18.989 --> 03:20.866
I just think
if you get to travel on business,

03:20.949 --> 03:22.743
then I get to gripe at home.

03:22.826 --> 03:24.536
Which brings me
to the bottom-line question,

03:24.619 --> 03:25.871
when are you coming back?

03:25.954 --> 03:27.998
How many calories
are in a kiwi anyway?

03:28.081 --> 03:29.166
Twelve a slice.

03:29.249 --> 03:32.043
No, tonight is not soon enough,
but it'll definitely do.

03:32.127 --> 03:34.671
Yeah, we'll come up
with something special to welcome you.

03:34.754 --> 03:36.965
No wonder everybody out here
has a great body.

03:37.048 --> 03:40.677
- Everything healthy is delicious.
- Well, at that price, it'd better be.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.764
- What time's Dad due home?
- By dinner, if his plane's on time.

03:44.890 --> 03:47.475
Yes, your children are right here.

03:48.018 --> 03:49.811
Yes, they're fine. They're fine.

03:49.894 --> 03:52.897
In fact, they're totally bad,
or I don't know, maybe it's rad.

03:52.981 --> 03:54.691
I don't have the lingo down yet.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.903
Yeah, me, too. I'll see you tonight. Bye.

04:01.114 --> 04:03.742
Poor Dad.
He transfers out here from the Midwest

04:03.825 --> 04:05.744
and his first business trip's
back to Chicago.

04:05.827 --> 04:09.789
Yeah. Kind of makes you wonder
what we're doing out here, doesn't it?

04:12.292 --> 04:15.795
<i>Yo, West Beverly,
this is TGIF in a major way today</i>

04:15.879 --> 04:17.046
<i>'cause the sun is shining</i>

04:17.130 --> 04:20.175
<i>and yours truly is stoked
for some major tanning this weekend.</i>

04:20.257 --> 04:23.595
<i>Check it out. 'Cause if life's a beach,
then why not live it?</i>

04:23.678 --> 04:25.555
<i>This here's DJ Mike MC,</i>

04:25.638 --> 04:28.224
<i>the voice of rhyme and reason,
on KWBH,</i>

04:28.308 --> 04:30.393
<i>a def jam that's always pleasing.</i>

04:30.476 --> 04:33.813
<i>Ciao, adios, sayonara, shalom. See ya.</i>

04:37.400 --> 04:39.527
- I knew it.
- What?

04:39.610 --> 04:41.487
That I'd be going to the beach, I knew it.

04:41.571 --> 04:43.197
Yeah, you and everyone else
around here.

04:43.281 --> 04:46.951
No, no, no, I'm serious.
I had a dream about it last night.

04:48.202 --> 04:49.412
Kelly!

04:50.121 --> 04:52.623
- Brenda. Hi.
- Hi.

04:52.915 --> 04:56.169
- You remember my brother.
- Hi, Brenda's brother.

04:56.377 --> 04:59.463
- Brandon. Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

04:59.672 --> 05:03.634
- So what're you guys up to?
- This weekend? Working on my back.

05:03.718 --> 05:07.054
I spent all last Saturday lying on it,
so my tan is totally uneven.

05:07.138 --> 05:10.224
At least you have one.
I'm starting from scratch.

05:10.308 --> 05:13.602
Well, start this weekend. Secos State
Beach is gonna be a major scene.

05:13.686 --> 05:16.230
Great.
Look, I'll see you guys later, okay?

05:16.772 --> 05:19.108
Brenda, your brother is dope.

05:19.984 --> 05:23.863
So, anyway, you know,
I am in desperate need of a new look.

05:23.946 --> 05:26.365
Oh, yeah? Well, with that new nose,
you'll need one, Kel.

05:26.449 --> 05:30.995
What's next? Tummy tuck?
Liposuction? Pierced nostril?

05:31.954 --> 05:35.457
No, Steve, I'm just gonna have
your mouth wired shut.

05:35.541 --> 05:37.918
Come on, before he asks for alimony.

05:38.002 --> 05:41.005
Oh, yeah. Well, after a year with you,
I deserve it.

05:42.256 --> 05:45.175
- I love it. I love it!
- What?

05:45.551 --> 05:50.264
Kelly Taylor at Secos Beach,
in a bikini, huh?

05:51.557 --> 05:55.352
- Steve! Steve Sanders! How's it going?
- It's gone.

05:55.561 --> 05:57.813
<i>Did you see the Hartley House?
It was my favorite rerun.</i>

05:57.896 --> 05:59.606
The episode where the Hartleys enter
Mary Jo

05:59.690 --> 06:00.941
in the "Mother of the Year" contest

06:01.024 --> 06:02.901
and by accident
their essays go to the President.

06:02.985 --> 06:04.486
Look, I don't watch the show, okay?

06:04.570 --> 06:06.780
Why should you?
I mean, you've got Mary Jo Hartley

06:06.864 --> 06:08.198
as your real-life mom.

06:08.282 --> 06:12.369
God, it must be incredibly cool to have
Samantha Sanders as your mother.

06:12.452 --> 06:15.747
Steve? Later, dude.

06:17.666 --> 06:20.669
Gee, Dave, I don't think he likes you.

06:32.389 --> 06:34.057
I was wondering
when you'd waltz in here.

06:34.141 --> 06:37.227
Oh, good morning, Andrea.
So nice to see you, too.

06:37.310 --> 06:38.645
Hi, Miss Rye.

06:38.728 --> 06:41.106
Our ace sports writer.
Always a pleasure.

06:41.189 --> 06:44.276
Here, Ace, your next assignment.

06:47.445 --> 06:48.947
Sorry, chief.

06:49.114 --> 06:52.367
I don't do editorials,
especially when they're called,

06:52.450 --> 06:56.454
"From the Midwest to West Beverly:
A Transfer Student Speaks."

06:57.372 --> 06:59.582
So change the title.

07:01.251 --> 07:05.380
- A little help, Miss Rye?
- I'm just the advisor. She's the boss.

07:05.588 --> 07:07.632
Brandon, just try it.

07:07.716 --> 07:10.093
You might be surprised
by what happens.

07:10.343 --> 07:14.055
Besides, you're too good
just to cover sports anyway.

07:14.472 --> 07:16.266
Really? You think?

07:16.433 --> 07:17.767
She does.

07:22.063 --> 07:24.107
Okay, fine. I'll try it.

07:24.399 --> 07:26.818
Great. Deadline's tomorrow.

07:27.694 --> 07:30.488
- Tomorrow? That's one day.
- And a night.

07:30.697 --> 07:33.074
Andrea, I think it'll keep till Monday.

07:33.408 --> 07:35.535
Morning. First thing.

07:36.494 --> 07:39.414
- You are relentless!
- Thank you.

07:43.835 --> 07:45.586
<i>Down. Open.</i>

07:46.003 --> 07:47.046
<i>Up.</i>

07:49.048 --> 07:50.216
<i>Left.</i>

08:00.393 --> 08:02.895
- What is it?
- Floor plan.

08:04.939 --> 08:08.025
- What for?
- The perfect dance club.

08:10.945 --> 08:13.155
I see you've done your homework, man.

08:13.239 --> 08:16.867
Looks are deceiving.
I've never set foot inside a club.

08:16.951 --> 08:19.120
Every time I try, I get carded.

08:19.203 --> 08:21.163
So how'd you design it?

08:21.247 --> 08:24.250
I used my imagination
instead of my experience.

08:24.333 --> 08:27.711
Oh, how sweet. How touching.

08:27.795 --> 08:31.549
- A little dork with big dreams.
- But no experience.

08:31.632 --> 08:32.674
Yeah.

08:32.758 --> 08:34.760
At least I'm not the missing link.

08:34.844 --> 08:36.595
What did you say?

08:37.054 --> 08:38.514
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, guy.

08:38.597 --> 08:40.265
Where's that erase command
anyway, huh?

08:40.349 --> 08:42.601
Touch that board, my friend.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.313
Please.

08:48.732 --> 08:50.067
Touch it.

08:51.735 --> 08:54.446
You know, the tragedy of this country

08:54.822 --> 08:57.574
is that cretins like you two
end up running it.

08:57.658 --> 08:58.992
Yeah, and losers like you end up...

08:59.076 --> 09:02.663
Let me tell you something
just so you know in advance,

09:03.205 --> 09:05.499
I'm not in a good mood today.

09:07.584 --> 09:10.337
In fact, I'm feeling a little hostile.

09:23.183 --> 09:26.979
You're doing a good job, kid.
Keep up the good work.

09:34.152 --> 09:36.279
Your friend's pretty cool.

09:36.988 --> 09:39.032
I never seen the guy in my life.

09:56.550 --> 09:57.676
Hey.

10:00.887 --> 10:02.973
My name's Brandon Walsh.

10:03.139 --> 10:04.683
Brandon Walsh.

10:05.850 --> 10:07.519
Scotch or Irish?

10:08.019 --> 10:11.606
Both, actually, by way of Minnesota.

10:15.318 --> 10:19.406
Listen, what you did to those two
nimrods back there was great.

10:19.489 --> 10:23.910
Yeah, well, I just don't believe
in winning through intimidation.

10:25.411 --> 10:28.414
Unless of course
I'm doing the intimidating.

10:28.915 --> 10:30.375
Are you hungry?

10:30.458 --> 10:32.919
I got next period off.
We could go grab a bite.

10:33.002 --> 10:35.421
Yeah. Let's do lunch.

10:41.552 --> 10:44.097
Don't see much water in Minnesota.

10:44.263 --> 10:46.349
Lots of lakes. No oceans.

10:47.517 --> 10:49.060
My sympathies.

10:51.562 --> 10:52.855
Come on.

10:53.356 --> 10:56.150
- Where're we going?
- Field trip.

11:11.541 --> 11:14.001
I don't know, Dylan.
I got this editorial I gotta write.

11:14.085 --> 11:15.461
Yo, McKay!

11:18.047 --> 11:21.008
What's up, bro?
Let's get in the green room!

11:21.092 --> 11:23.844
Come on, Dylan,
let's catch some waves!

11:25.638 --> 11:28.057
Man, I dreamed about this place.

11:28.808 --> 11:30.267
Who doesn't?

11:31.769 --> 11:33.854
Welcome to paradise, man.

11:34.063 --> 11:36.482
Welcome to your dream come true.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.369
Wipe out!

12:30.452 --> 12:31.995
Barney!

12:34.623 --> 12:36.375
Are you all right?

12:36.500 --> 12:37.834
I got you.

12:37.918 --> 12:39.670
Are you all right?

12:39.920 --> 12:41.797
Yo, Minnesota!

12:42.547 --> 12:43.924
You all right?

12:44.007 --> 12:45.467
I love this.

12:46.051 --> 12:47.677
Barney!

12:49.930 --> 12:53.809
When you graduate to the big board,
we'll have to tie it to your ankle.

12:53.892 --> 12:56.478
I think that's a little optimistic.

12:59.731 --> 13:03.985
Hey, when we got here, those guys told
Dylan to get in the green room.

13:04.069 --> 13:05.612
Is that what you guys call the ocean?

13:05.695 --> 13:09.532
No, the ocean's our house and the
green room's the gnarliest place in it.

13:09.616 --> 13:13.119
When you're in the green room,
you're riding the perfect wave.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.582
You don't go to West Beverly, do you?

13:17.666 --> 13:21.920
Me? No.
I don't go to West Beverly or Beverly.

13:23.755 --> 13:25.632
I live in the Valley.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.384
You know,
darkness at the edge of town.

13:31.513 --> 13:33.890
- So, how do you know Dylan?
- I don't.

13:33.973 --> 13:37.477
I mean, who does?
The guy's not exactly an open book.

13:37.977 --> 13:40.897
Not that he'd let me read into him
anyway.

13:42.106 --> 13:43.983
Then what's he doing here?

13:44.150 --> 13:46.194
Dylan just likes to hang with us,

13:46.277 --> 13:48.738
you know,
bust a few with Eric and Duane.

13:55.953 --> 13:57.830
My real name's Sarah.

13:58.289 --> 14:00.875
Eric and Duane call me Betty,
'cause that's what they think I am,

14:00.958 --> 14:03.711
some dumb little surf betty, you know.

14:04.921 --> 14:08.841
But I got my own stick.
And I can match any guy on it.

14:09.467 --> 14:11.010
I bet you can.

14:12.762 --> 14:14.555
You're really nice.

14:14.639 --> 14:17.808
- Yeah, well, I'm from out of town.
- I can tell.

14:18.559 --> 14:22.647
Well, we're here every morning at 6:00.
Sunrise surf.

14:23.105 --> 14:24.815
And it's awesome.

14:25.691 --> 14:28.027
I'm there, Sarah.

14:32.740 --> 14:34.825
- Good.
- Good.

14:45.753 --> 14:49.548
Gross, grosser, grossest.

14:50.132 --> 14:53.385
Kelly, come on. Some of this stuff
would look great on you.

14:53.469 --> 14:56.347
We're going to the beach,
not the Valley.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.644
Oh, wow. Oh, Brenda. Yes.

15:02.019 --> 15:04.438
These are hot. These are you.

15:06.315 --> 15:08.525
These are $150.

15:09.360 --> 15:12.237
Well, chic or cheap, the choice is yours.

15:13.030 --> 15:14.615
No, it's yours.

15:15.783 --> 15:17.534
I can't afford to choose.

15:21.747 --> 15:24.333
- Hi. Paper or plastic?
- Plastic.

15:24.416 --> 15:26.126
<i>Toujours plastic.</i>

15:31.506 --> 15:34.176
<i>Steven. Steven.</i>

15:38.513 --> 15:39.723
What's up, Mom?

15:39.806 --> 15:42.517
<i>Are we still on for dinner,
or do you have too much homework?</i>

15:42.601 --> 15:43.727
What, are you kidding?

15:43.810 --> 15:47.606
Give up a dinner with a mother
who's both talented and famous?

15:48.565 --> 15:51.068
<i>Flattery will get you everywhere.</i>

15:51.526 --> 15:55.572
<i>Sweetie, do you know the Silver boy?
I believe he's new.</i>

15:55.781 --> 15:58.784
<i>- What about him?
- His father's Mel Silver.</i>

15:59.284 --> 16:02.204
<i>He's producing a new series
with a part I'd be perfect for.</i>

16:02.287 --> 16:04.331
Oh, so you want me
to be nice to his son?

16:04.414 --> 16:06.166
<i>I want you to be nice to everyone.</i>

16:06.249 --> 16:10.962
<i>But if you do see this David Silver,
it wouldn't hurt to tell his dad I'm a fan,</i>

16:11.046 --> 16:12.088
<i>would it?</i>

16:12.172 --> 16:14.633
No, Mom.
Even if it means talking to him.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.052
Look, I gotta go. You're on.

16:38.990 --> 16:43.745
Eighteen degrees in October?
Welcome to tropical Chicago.

16:44.913 --> 16:46.748
Of course it's 50 degrees warmer here.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.375
It's one of the main reasons
I agreed to move.

16:49.459 --> 16:51.711
You do remember our agreement,
don't you, Jim?

16:51.794 --> 16:53.379
Mom, did you unpack the sewing kit yet?

16:53.463 --> 16:56.257
Linen closet. Top shelf.
Your father's on the phone.

16:56.341 --> 16:59.552
Oh. No, he isn't. He has to go.
He sends his love.

16:59.635 --> 17:03.097
- I love you, too, Daddy.
- Yeah, your daughter loves you, too.

17:03.514 --> 17:05.767
Yeah, and so does your wife.

17:06.476 --> 17:09.186
Call me later. Okay, bye-bye.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.066
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

17:15.193 --> 17:18.279
- So, where is he?
- Oh, he's still in Chicago.

17:18.445 --> 17:19.864
Staying till tomorrow.

17:19.946 --> 17:22.532
Well, so much
for our big "welcome back" feast.

17:22.617 --> 17:25.536
Which means there'll be more
for the three of us.

17:25.619 --> 17:27.496
Better make that two.

17:28.289 --> 17:30.374
Paper assigned me an editorial.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.294
Really? What about?

17:33.753 --> 17:37.256
Oh, you know, about moving here,
being here.

17:37.715 --> 17:39.717
Worked on it all afternoon.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.011
I figure I'm good
for a couple more hours at the library

17:42.094 --> 17:44.680
before my brain totally shuts down.

17:45.222 --> 17:48.309
Hey, how about some fuel
for the rest of you?

17:49.059 --> 17:50.478
No. Thanks.

17:51.353 --> 17:54.773
I think I'd rather just keep
running on empty. Bye.

17:54.857 --> 17:57.193
- Don't work too hard.
- I won't.

18:06.160 --> 18:10.539
- So, did we get Daddy's permission?
- Nope, we got Mom's.

18:18.422 --> 18:20.174
What you doing?

18:20.382 --> 18:24.553
Trying to make for free
what those trendy stores sell for $150.

18:26.346 --> 18:28.891
- You need any help?
- All I can get.

18:36.148 --> 18:39.151
You know, that paper's certainly keeping
your brother busy.

18:39.234 --> 18:41.737
Yeah, I'm swamped enough
with schoolwork.

18:42.654 --> 18:45.949
This girl who graduated last year
came back to visit.

18:46.033 --> 18:49.036
I heard her say that West Beverly
was harder than college.

18:49.119 --> 18:51.538
What isn't harder out here?

18:52.914 --> 18:55.000
Oh. You know what I mean.

18:55.375 --> 18:58.795
More homework, bigger homes,
better clothes...

18:59.171 --> 19:01.923
Not better. Just more expensive.

19:04.426 --> 19:05.927
Well, I'm glad you know the difference.

19:06.011 --> 19:07.929
Yeah, well,
that doesn't mean I like watching Kelly

19:08.013 --> 19:10.056
give her credit cards a workout.

19:12.642 --> 19:16.521
I wonder what it would be like
to be able to take it all for granted.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.400
Do you like this?

19:20.775 --> 19:23.945
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's good.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.197
Good.

19:32.871 --> 19:36.166
So, is this what you call
the Sunset Strip, man?

19:37.250 --> 19:39.961
No. That's what the tourists call it.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.465
Maybe he'll get hip by graduation.

19:45.258 --> 19:48.720
- I think he's fine right now.
- I bet you do.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.723
What are you two doing here?

19:51.806 --> 19:54.225
Same thing you are,
waiting for something to happen.

19:54.309 --> 19:57.020
Yeah, well, it ain't happening here.

19:57.854 --> 19:59.731
- Come on.
- Where're you going?

19:59.814 --> 20:03.443
- Anywhere but here. You wanna come?
- Yeah, sure, Dylan. I'd love to.

20:03.526 --> 20:06.863
Hey. She goes where we go.

20:06.946 --> 20:08.740
Isn't that her decision?

20:08.823 --> 20:12.201
Oh, well, you heard him. Decide.

20:17.039 --> 20:18.749
We'll follow you.

20:27.633 --> 20:29.093
What's this?

20:29.176 --> 20:31.095
Oh, a little leisure reading.

20:31.178 --> 20:33.431
<i>"Byron: The collected works"?</i>

20:33.681 --> 20:36.559
Mad, bad and dangerous to know.

20:38.185 --> 20:40.313
That was him and that's me.

20:40.396 --> 20:43.232
Your surfer buddies know
you read poetry?

20:43.315 --> 20:47.028
Those boneheads wouldn't know
a poem if it walked up and bit them.

20:47.111 --> 20:50.740
- Except Betty. She's cool.
- She doesn't think so.

20:51.699 --> 20:55.035
She would if those guys didn't treat her
like a doormat.

20:55.411 --> 20:57.580
Hell, we all think
we deserve something better,

20:57.663 --> 21:00.457
but Betty really does.

21:02.835 --> 21:05.129
Yo, McKay! Where're we going?

21:28.986 --> 21:31.947
- What are we doing here?
- Visiting friends.

21:32.781 --> 21:36.952
I thought you people from the Midwest
were supposed to be so sociable.

21:37.828 --> 21:39.121
Come on.

21:53.427 --> 21:54.720
Come on.

22:01.810 --> 22:04.730
So, Dylan, these friends of yours
know we're coming?

22:04.813 --> 22:06.189
Of course.

22:16.741 --> 22:17.951
Voila.

22:23.081 --> 22:25.834
Well, don't just stand there. Come on.

22:26.751 --> 22:29.004
Where do you suppose...

22:32.007 --> 22:33.800
Let there be light.

22:33.883 --> 22:35.802
This is so outrageous.

22:39.472 --> 22:42.350
Hey, don't just stand there. Come on in.

22:42.684 --> 22:44.644
Okay, come on, Dylan.
Let's just get out of here.

22:44.727 --> 22:45.895
Go grab a burger or something.

22:45.979 --> 22:49.566
Hey, I got a better idea.
Let's stay and grab one.

22:51.568 --> 22:55.238
Room service. This is room 211.

22:55.321 --> 22:56.489
Dylan, come on.

22:56.573 --> 22:58.950
I'd like to order five cheeseburgers,
please. Medium well.

22:59.033 --> 23:01.327
- Is that all right with you guys?
- Oh, yeah.

23:01.411 --> 23:03.288
Yeah, five orders of French fries.

23:03.371 --> 23:05.331
All right, that's it. I'm out of here.

23:05.415 --> 23:08.084
Minnesota, really, you gotta relax.

23:08.167 --> 23:12.046
Look, if I want to relax, I'll do it
in my own room, not somebody else's.

23:12.130 --> 23:14.799
- Hey, Brandon, wait.
- For what?

23:15.216 --> 23:17.593
To get busted
for breaking and entering?

23:17.677 --> 23:21.139
- It was just for fun.
- Not where I'm from, it isn't.

23:21.639 --> 23:24.016
Come on, Brandon. Stay with me.

23:29.438 --> 23:32.066
You better make that order for four.

23:36.195 --> 23:37.697
Hey, Minnesota, wait up.

23:37.780 --> 23:40.783
The name's Brandon, all right?
Brandon Walsh.

23:40.866 --> 23:43.286
- It's Scotch-lrish, remember?
- How could I forget?

23:43.369 --> 23:45.538
Excuse me, when your order is ready,

23:45.621 --> 23:48.124
would you be eating on the terrace
or up in your suite?

23:48.207 --> 23:51.502
- Upstairs is cool, Tony.
- Very good, sir.

23:52.420 --> 23:53.546
You live here?

23:53.629 --> 23:55.965
Dad's corporate pad.
It's mine when he's out of town.

23:56.048 --> 23:59.009
- And how often is that?
- Often as possible.

23:59.093 --> 24:01.762
You see, my parents,
they aren't exactly into parenting.

24:01.846 --> 24:04.557
But, oh... Don't tell them upstairs.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.267
Wouldn't want to spoil the fun.

24:06.350 --> 24:09.228
No, no, no. We wouldn't want to do that.

24:10.271 --> 24:11.647
Well, stick around.

24:11.730 --> 24:14.733
Henry downstairs makes
the best French fries in town.

24:15.276 --> 24:18.654
Brandon, come on.
You wouldn't want to ruin my reputation.

24:19.405 --> 24:20.906
You're right.

24:21.532 --> 24:24.785
I wouldn't want to ruin
the only real thing you've got.

24:36.839 --> 24:40.717
- Any year you're ready, Bren.
- I said you could come in.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.931
What are you so crabby about, anyway?

24:46.014 --> 24:47.391
Lousy night.

24:47.474 --> 24:49.142
You know, I've got news for you.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.853
No one enjoys spending
Friday night studying.

24:52.729 --> 24:54.773
I wasn't at the library.

24:55.274 --> 24:58.944
I hung out on the Sunset Strip,
or whatever it's cool to call it,

24:59.027 --> 25:00.654
and the Bel Age Hotel.

25:00.737 --> 25:03.532
- For your editorial?
- No, for fun.

25:04.324 --> 25:05.867
At least, that was the idea.

25:05.951 --> 25:09.746
Ignoring the most obvious question,
which is why wasn't I invited,

25:09.830 --> 25:13.250
- how did you end up at the hotel?
- This guy I know.

25:13.667 --> 25:17.087
- His parents keep a suite there.
- Guy? What guy?

25:17.337 --> 25:20.465
He's in my tech class.
His name's Dylan McKay.

25:20.674 --> 25:23.677
Wake up, Brandon.
Everybody knows about Dylan McKay.

25:23.927 --> 25:26.930
- Knows what?
- That he's, like, major trouble.

25:27.013 --> 25:29.599
I heard he got this girl in Paris pregnant.

25:31.893 --> 25:35.855
I'm not surprised. And you know what?
I don't care.

25:38.608 --> 25:41.695
You know, I think for a while

25:41.778 --> 25:43.947
I'm just gonna go back to being

25:44.030 --> 25:46.658
my old, basic uncool self.

25:56.918 --> 25:59.420
Why, Kelly, so nice to see you.

25:59.796 --> 26:02.298
Honey, she's here!

26:03.716 --> 26:05.677
What I could do with a car like that.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.763
Yeah, what I'd do
with a daughter like that.

26:11.557 --> 26:14.143
- Brenda...
- I look awful.

26:15.436 --> 26:17.772
- You look great.
- Really?

26:18.147 --> 26:20.483
I take it all that mascara's waterproof?

26:20.566 --> 26:22.443
Oh, Mom, don't start.

26:24.237 --> 26:25.446
So, how great?

26:25.530 --> 26:27.907
Greater than that fashion victim
out there.

26:27.990 --> 26:31.327
- Kelly? How does she look?
- Like a reject from a Megadeth video.

26:31.410 --> 26:33.913
Yeah, well,
she paid a fortune for that outfit.

26:33.996 --> 26:35.540
Well, come on.

26:36.749 --> 26:39.877
- No, I don't think so.
- Brandon, it'll be fun.

26:42.004 --> 26:44.757
- I'm not happy with my viewpoint.
- You're not happy, period.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.550
I mean, all you do is study.

26:46.634 --> 26:50.846
- Lf I go, who'll keep Mom company?
- Oh, no. No, not on my account.

26:50.930 --> 26:53.599
You were at the library
till late last night.

26:53.683 --> 26:57.269
- Yeah, but...
- Brandon, we're in California.

26:58.354 --> 27:01.232
It's the beach.
What have you been dreaming about?

27:01.857 --> 27:04.360
Really, I'm fine. I'm okay.

27:08.155 --> 27:10.241
The sun block's upstairs.

27:46.318 --> 27:49.279
- This is great.
- This is bogus.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.907
I don't see a single person
that I would want to talk to.

27:51.990 --> 27:55.661
- Besides, I'm freezing.
- Well, you should've dressed warmer.

27:55.744 --> 27:58.580
Donna, I didn't pay a small fortune
to look like an Eskimo.

27:58.664 --> 28:01.333
I have to go check on my brother.
He doesn't know anyone.

28:03.377 --> 28:06.505
Hey, Kel. Warm enough?

28:17.808 --> 28:19.768
Surf dudes unite!

28:23.271 --> 28:24.564
We're united.

28:24.648 --> 28:26.900
Welcome, welcome.

28:27.776 --> 28:32.864
I'm organizing an organization
against tourists from West Beverly.

28:33.698 --> 28:36.952
They walk this way,
they get their ass kicked.

28:37.244 --> 28:38.411
Yeah.

28:38.495 --> 28:40.622
This beach belongs to us.

28:40.705 --> 28:43.249
The beach and Betty.

28:47.170 --> 28:50.131
Oh, boo-hoo. We hurt her feelings.

28:50.215 --> 28:54.177
Oh, she's just bummed
'cause she'd rather hang out with them.

28:55.303 --> 29:00.308
I wouldn't socialize with those...
For anything.

29:03.645 --> 29:07.440
- Here, Brandon. Help yourself.
- No. Thanks.

29:11.194 --> 29:12.362
Guys,

29:14.447 --> 29:16.240
he's a teetotaler.

29:16.908 --> 29:19.619
- And I'm totaled.
- Yes.

29:20.203 --> 29:22.497
Hey, I'll see you guys later.

29:23.164 --> 29:24.832
- Later, bro.
- Hey, wait.

29:27.418 --> 29:29.212
I was just being friendly.

29:29.295 --> 29:32.215
Yeah, well,
you were friendlier yesterday.

29:32.298 --> 29:34.133
You were also sober.

29:35.301 --> 29:37.637
- I thought you liked me.
- I do.

29:40.806 --> 29:42.600
But this isn't you.

29:44.310 --> 29:46.020
Be careful, okay?

29:53.986 --> 29:56.030
Oh, come on, surf's up.

30:01.494 --> 30:05.206
Okay, look, you got sand
in our Cheetos. Thanks.

30:10.336 --> 30:11.879
Yo, Minnesota!

30:16.175 --> 30:17.968
What, you still not cool yet?

30:18.052 --> 30:20.387
- Not cool enough for you.
- Hey.

30:23.349 --> 30:25.851
Last night was supposed to be fun.

30:25.935 --> 30:29.271
If it wasn't, well, I apologize.

30:30.147 --> 30:32.316
But it was supposed to be.

30:33.275 --> 30:36.487
You know, you told me
why Betty hangs with those guys,

30:36.779 --> 30:39.365
but what I want to know is, why do you?

30:39.448 --> 30:41.742
Look, if I wanted to hang with them,

30:41.825 --> 30:44.369
I'd be over there right now,
drinking myself into a stupor,

30:44.453 --> 30:45.913
but I'm not.

30:46.205 --> 30:48.832
I'm standing here 'cause I'm sorry.

30:49.416 --> 30:51.502
I want to be your friend.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.212
Truce?

30:56.340 --> 30:57.549
Truce.

30:57.716 --> 30:59.384
Cool. You coming?

30:59.468 --> 31:03.263
- No, my sister's back there.
- Well, I'm out of here. Later.

31:15.233 --> 31:16.651
Hey, Steve.

31:18.862 --> 31:20.447
Some party, huh?

31:20.947 --> 31:23.575
Yeah, it's all right. How you doing?

31:23.742 --> 31:27.579
Just fine. Fine. I...
I'm doing fine. Fine, sir.

31:28.538 --> 31:31.583
You know, my mom knows your dad.
She said to say hello.

31:31.666 --> 31:35.170
- Oh, really? I'll tell him that.
- All right, do that.

31:36.671 --> 31:39.466
- I'll see you around.
- All right.

31:42.218 --> 31:43.428
Sorry.

31:50.018 --> 31:53.855
David, your dad doesn't know
Samantha Sanders.

31:54.439 --> 31:57.067
Who cares? We're in.

32:02.489 --> 32:04.657
This party is totally beat.

32:06.075 --> 32:07.994
Does that mean we're leaving?

32:08.077 --> 32:09.954
- Means I am.
- Me, too.

32:10.830 --> 32:12.582
I'll go find Brandon.

32:22.383 --> 32:24.802
- Hey, Bren.
- Hey.

32:26.888 --> 32:30.641
- Are you having fun?
- In a word? No.

32:30.767 --> 32:32.935
Good. Kelly wants to leave.

32:33.352 --> 32:37.065
- I think she just did.
- No way, I just left her.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.901
- I can't believe it.
- I can.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.737
Come on.
Someone else will give us a ride.

32:42.820 --> 32:46.115
Brandon, I don't believe people surf
when it's this cold.

32:48.201 --> 32:49.410
That's Sarah.

32:50.870 --> 32:52.163
Brandon!

33:13.976 --> 33:16.103
- She's not breathing.
- Oh, my God.

33:16.187 --> 33:18.189
911, Brenda. Right now!

33:19.273 --> 33:21.108
Okay. Okay.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.323
Oh, come on, Sarah, breathe.

33:29.658 --> 33:31.368
Breathe! Come on!

33:40.502 --> 33:43.881
- So, you're sure she'll be okay?
- Thanks to you two.

33:43.964 --> 33:47.384
Her body temp had already dropped
two degrees from exposure.

33:47.593 --> 33:48.969
Is that normal?

33:49.053 --> 33:51.722
Depends on what your definition
of normal is.

33:51.805 --> 33:54.391
Happens all the time to alcoholics.

33:55.100 --> 33:59.521
- Are you saying she's an alcoholic?
- Nobody drinks that much for fun.

34:02.107 --> 34:05.736
- They're all right?
- They're fine. They're also heroes.

34:08.530 --> 34:10.239
You should've seen him, Mom.

34:10.324 --> 34:12.576
The paramedics said
that he saved that girl's life.

34:12.659 --> 34:15.786
- But you're all right?
- Really, Mom. We're fine.

34:15.911 --> 34:18.581
- And we're sorry.
- What've you got to be sorry about?

34:18.665 --> 34:21.626
I mean, you heard the doctor,
you're heroes.

34:22.043 --> 34:25.172
I think she meant
you must've been worried.

34:25.255 --> 34:26.840
Worried? Me?

34:27.466 --> 34:29.259
What reason would I have to worry?

34:29.342 --> 34:32.053
I mean, your father goes away
on business, you two go to the beach,

34:32.137 --> 34:33.972
I don't hear from you for hours

34:34.054 --> 34:36.433
and the next thing I hear is
some hospital calling to tell me

34:36.516 --> 34:38.476
to come get my children.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.606
I have to tell you something.

34:43.523 --> 34:46.985
If this is a day in a life
of your basic Beverly Hills family,

34:47.068 --> 34:49.446
we're moving back to Minnesota.

35:12.802 --> 35:14.179
Hey, dude.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.848
Yo, Minnesota, glad you could make it.

35:16.931 --> 35:18.558
Hey, where's your stick, bro?

35:18.641 --> 35:19.851
Where's Sarah?

35:19.934 --> 35:21.644
- Who?
- He means Betty.

35:21.728 --> 35:22.896
Got me, man.

35:22.979 --> 35:24.897
When we split last night,
she was stoked to surf

35:24.981 --> 35:26.316
right then and there, huh, bro?

35:26.399 --> 35:27.609
What happened?

35:28.568 --> 35:30.320
You guys are scum.

35:31.654 --> 35:32.947
Excuse me?

35:33.031 --> 35:35.700
No way. Not now, not ever.

35:37.201 --> 35:38.578
Hey, whoa.

35:39.203 --> 35:40.455
Look...

35:41.038 --> 35:42.790
All right, enough.

35:44.625 --> 35:47.503
I said, enough! Enough!

35:51.048 --> 35:52.675
What happened to her?

35:52.758 --> 35:54.677
Call Malibu Hospital. They'll tell you.

35:54.760 --> 35:58.306
- She better be all right.
- She is, no thanks to them.

35:58.389 --> 36:01.851
- Hey, man, we didn't know.
- You didn't care, either.

36:10.526 --> 36:13.487
Man, that guy is a real tool.

36:37.261 --> 36:38.887
Hey, thanks, man.

36:38.971 --> 36:41.223
Sorry I didn't stick around last night
to help.

36:41.307 --> 36:44.059
- Well, you didn't know.
- I should have.

36:44.935 --> 36:47.062
Hey, you up for breakfast?

36:48.063 --> 36:51.275
I've... I've got an editorial to write.

36:51.859 --> 36:55.237
The one you were supposed to write the
other day when I dragged you out here?

36:55.320 --> 36:56.488
Yeah.

36:57.740 --> 37:00.617
Only now, I know what to write it about.

37:07.833 --> 37:09.626
Kelly called again.

37:10.335 --> 37:13.046
Next time tell her I moved back
to Minneapolis.

37:13.839 --> 37:17.301
- She feels bad enough already.
- She should.

37:18.010 --> 37:20.345
I think you're being too hard on her,
Bren.

37:20.429 --> 37:22.556
I mean, how do you learn
to be considerate of people

37:22.639 --> 37:25.100
when no one's ever been
considerate of you?

37:25.183 --> 37:27.352
Well, that's very mature, Brandon,

37:27.436 --> 37:30.397
but you aren't the one
she's never considerate of.

37:32.065 --> 37:33.233
Here.

37:35.652 --> 37:38.029
- What's this?
- Just read it.

37:39.614 --> 37:43.285
"The Green Room. By Brandon Walsh."
What's a green room?

37:43.660 --> 37:45.036
Just read.

37:46.830 --> 37:50.333
"There's an expression surfers use
for the curl of a perfect wave.

37:50.417 --> 37:51.710
"It's called the green room,

37:51.793 --> 37:54.629
"and getting inside,
it's the peak of the ride."

37:55.005 --> 37:56.840
This is about sports?

37:56.923 --> 37:59.718
It's my viewpoint, Bren.
Just read it, okay?

37:59.801 --> 38:01.469
Okay, I'm sorry.

38:03.013 --> 38:05.015
"To a new student like myself,

38:05.098 --> 38:07.809
"the green room might as well be
West Beverly

38:07.892 --> 38:09.394
"because getting inside it,

38:09.477 --> 38:13.398
"to the 'in' crowd, the 'in' parties,
the 'in' clothes and 'in' cars,

38:13.481 --> 38:16.776
"requires a skill they never taught us
back in Minnesota.

38:16.860 --> 38:18.611
"Or so I thought.

38:19.237 --> 38:21.614
"That was when I took it all
at face value,

38:21.698 --> 38:25.201
"when I believed people's images
and played along with them.

38:25.535 --> 38:29.497
"What I've learnt is that appearances
can be very deceiving,

38:29.747 --> 38:33.459
"and if you believe them, you deceive
yourself more than anyone else.

38:33.543 --> 38:35.253
"I know better now.

38:35.336 --> 38:37.630
"So when you meet me in the halls
or in class

38:37.714 --> 38:39.549
"or on the lawn at lunch,

38:39.632 --> 38:42.093
"I'll be looking
for more than meets the eye.

38:42.176 --> 38:44.178
"And I hope you will, too.

38:44.262 --> 38:46.723
"'Cause that's where the green room is."

38:48.808 --> 38:50.643
Brandon, it's beautiful.

38:50.726 --> 38:52.145
You think?

38:52.520 --> 38:55.106
I'm so touched,
I may even call Kelly and forgive her.

38:55.189 --> 38:58.776
Well, now, I wouldn't want you to do
anything too hasty.

38:58.860 --> 39:01.863
Yeah, I'll let her suffer a little.
She deserves it.

39:03.406 --> 39:05.825
Good night, Bren. Thanks for listening.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.578
Just remember me

39:10.246 --> 39:13.541
when everybody wants to get
into your green room.

39:41.902 --> 39:44.655
Oh, you do speak English. That's good.

39:44.738 --> 39:46.407
Is Mrs McKay in?

39:47.992 --> 39:49.910
No? Well, who is this?

39:53.956 --> 39:55.416
The service?

39:58.669 --> 40:01.547
Well, did they leave a message
for Dylan?

40:04.133 --> 40:07.302
Dylan. Their son.

40:18.397 --> 40:19.815
No message?

40:24.611 --> 40:27.406
Would you just tell them that I called?

40:28.740 --> 40:31.743
Yeah. Yeah, they have the number.

40:57.769 --> 41:01.606
Yo, West Beverly,
it's that day of the week again.

41:01.690 --> 41:04.484
And this here's DJ Mike MC.

41:04.609 --> 41:08.405
<i>Now listen up, 'cause this song
ain't dedicated to the one I love,</i>

41:08.488 --> 41:11.241
<i>but to the local heroes who happened
to buck the rescue move</i>

41:11.324 --> 41:15.286
<i>on Secos State Beach this weekend
and save someone's life.</i>

41:15.412 --> 41:17.497
<i>Way to go, homies. Peace!</i>

41:19.290 --> 41:20.834
- David.
- Oh, hey, Steve.

41:20.917 --> 41:21.960
How you doing?

41:22.043 --> 41:23.878
Listen, I was wondering if you were free
for lunch sometime.

41:23.962 --> 41:25.922
- Oh, yeah. Anytime.
- With my mom and your dad.

41:26.005 --> 41:28.716
- Yeah, yeah, like I was saying, anytime.
- Great, all right.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.843
Actually, you know what,
I'm not sure about lunch.

41:30.927 --> 41:33.596
My dad is usually in surgery.
Is dinner cool?

41:33.680 --> 41:35.265
Yeah, I guess.

41:37.350 --> 41:39.727
What is your father doing in surgery?

41:40.979 --> 41:42.271
His job.

41:42.981 --> 41:46.943
- Your dad's Mel Silver, right?
- Yeah. You knew that.

41:47.026 --> 41:49.362
Yeah, Mel Silver the producer?

41:49.821 --> 41:53.449
No, Mel Silver, the oral surgeon.

41:54.033 --> 41:56.619
- I don't believe this.
- What's wrong?

41:56.702 --> 41:59.914
I've wasted all this time
on the wrong dweeb. Later.

42:04.252 --> 42:06.379
Well, we were in

42:07.755 --> 42:09.757
for about five minutes.

42:16.889 --> 42:20.476
Yo, Ace, I saw what you wrote.

42:21.811 --> 42:22.937
And?

42:23.062 --> 42:26.482
And I'm glad I made you do it.

42:27.108 --> 42:29.276
You know something, Andrea?

42:31.195 --> 42:32.488
So am I.

42:33.697 --> 42:34.865
Good.

42:41.330 --> 42:42.623
Brandon.

42:43.791 --> 42:45.000
Sarah?

42:46.418 --> 42:49.129
How are you? What are you doing here?

42:49.713 --> 42:51.757
Discharged this morning.

42:52.007 --> 42:54.969
Clean bill of health, at least physically.

42:57.179 --> 42:59.556
I thought my parents would wig,

43:00.265 --> 43:02.101
but they were cool.

43:02.893 --> 43:05.312
They want me to join a program.

43:05.396 --> 43:08.023
I think that's probably a good idea.

43:09.024 --> 43:10.317
So do I.

43:13.904 --> 43:17.533
You know, I'm not too good
about talking about my feelings,

43:17.616 --> 43:20.369
but I guess you can figure out
what they are about you

43:20.452 --> 43:22.162
and what you did.

43:25.040 --> 43:27.960
These people here
are really intimidating.

43:28.710 --> 43:31.505
These people don't have
anything on you.

43:36.885 --> 43:40.055
Listen, my last name is Walsh.

43:40.847 --> 43:43.100
Give me a call sometime, okay?
I'm listed.

43:43.183 --> 43:46.520
That's easy.
Not many people in Beverly Hills are.

43:49.022 --> 43:50.857
- I'll see you.
- Okay.

43:58.907 --> 44:02.244
I still cannot believe
you saved that girl's life.

44:03.078 --> 44:05.372
Everybody's talking about it.

44:07.082 --> 44:09.209
So, I'll see you at lunch?

44:11.002 --> 44:12.170
Sure.

44:17.467 --> 44:19.260
So, how's it going?

44:20.345 --> 44:22.388
Not bad. Not bad at all.

44:24.265 --> 44:25.850
You know, Bren,

44:26.768 --> 44:28.686
I think we're gonna make it here.

44:28.770 --> 44:31.481
- Speak for yourself.
- I was.
