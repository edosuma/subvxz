00:31.920 --> 00:32.951
Listen up.

00:34.339 --> 00:37.044
The night shift starts in five minutes.
Then you're mine.

00:37.217 --> 00:40.052
Hey, let's bet a hundo each
on the Ducks minus a 28.

00:40.220 --> 00:43.885
ASU minus four, LSU minus 12...

00:44.057 --> 00:47.889
K State plus five and a half
and the Aggies minus six.

00:48.061 --> 00:50.433
If you lose,
I'm not loaning you any more money.

00:50.605 --> 00:53.393
Serious. I have twins on the way.
My wife's gonna kill me.

00:53.567 --> 00:56.354
- I paid you back the 400.
- You owed me 800.

00:57.404 --> 00:59.646
- Hey, Topher.
- Dr. Alexander.

00:59.823 --> 01:01.103
- TC.
- Hey.

01:01.283 --> 01:03.489
Look for opportunities
to take your shirt off?

01:03.660 --> 01:06.198
You used to look for opportunities
for me to take my shirt off.

01:06.371 --> 01:09.574
I remember walking in
on one of those opportunities.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.869
You think you can show me
a modicum of respect as your boss?

01:13.045 --> 01:15.002
Only when we're on duty.

01:17.799 --> 01:19.175
That felt good.

01:19.343 --> 01:21.715
I don't know, T,
I think she's still into you.

01:23.138 --> 01:24.763
One, two, three.

01:24.931 --> 01:26.556
Come on, Drew, one, two, three.

01:26.725 --> 01:28.385
Defensive roll.

01:29.478 --> 01:31.581
You got a fight next week.
You can't let the Army down.

01:31.605 --> 01:34.178
Finish hard, finish hard.
Defensive roll.

01:36.735 --> 01:38.977
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

01:39.404 --> 01:40.567
What's up, Miss Krista?

01:40.739 --> 01:42.815
- Not much.
- Come on, show me what you got.

01:42.991 --> 01:44.189
Show me what you got.

01:44.368 --> 01:46.656
- Come on, two, three, two.
- You want more?

01:46.828 --> 01:48.951
Okay, not bad for a girl.

01:50.707 --> 01:52.581
How's that? For a girl?

01:53.210 --> 01:55.368
- That was pretty good.
- Attagirl, Krista!

01:55.837 --> 01:57.545
Did I not mention that she trains?

01:57.714 --> 01:59.090
- Sorry about that.
- Yeah.

01:59.257 --> 02:00.716
Yo. Paul, water.

02:00.884 --> 02:02.960
Oh, yeah. Gotcha.

02:06.556 --> 02:08.845
- Incoming!
- Do you want another one?

02:09.643 --> 02:10.971
Wha...?

02:15.899 --> 02:18.686
- Ma'am?
- I will leave when I am good and ready.

02:18.860 --> 02:21.186
You are ready.
You just have a sprained ankle.

02:21.363 --> 02:23.652
A severely sprained ankle.
Now, let me finish.

02:23.824 --> 02:25.484
And you need to get me
a wheelchair.

02:25.659 --> 02:29.028
I can't possibly bear any weight.
The pain is a 10 out of 10.

02:32.708 --> 02:34.665
Get her the wheelchair.

02:34.876 --> 02:36.786
Hey, hey, sweetie.

02:36.962 --> 02:39.714
How are you, hon? How was school?

02:39.881 --> 02:41.210
She Di...

02:47.764 --> 02:50.516
Forty-year-old female
with bilateral forearm fractures.

02:50.684 --> 02:54.349
Send trauma panel and type and cross
for six, and someone notify Ortho.

02:54.521 --> 02:56.099
Kenny, Paul, you're with me.

02:56.273 --> 02:59.274
- Got a stab wound to the neck.
- Guess we know why he crashed.

02:59.443 --> 03:02.728
Penetrating neck trauma,
zone two, G CS 111.

03:02.904 --> 03:04.482
Place two large bore IVs.

03:04.656 --> 03:07.361
- Set up for intubation.
- Guarding on left lower quadrant.

03:07.534 --> 03:09.112
Tell CAT scan we're coming.

03:09.286 --> 03:12.121
TC, we have an officer-involved
shooting. GSW to the chest.

03:12.289 --> 03:14.614
- Said to tell you it's Deputy Woods.
- Nick Woods?

03:14.791 --> 03:16.451
- Call the chopper.
- He's on his way.

03:16.626 --> 03:20.042
Set up a thoracotomy tray, prep
the rapid infuser. Let's get out there.

03:20.213 --> 03:23.167
- Can I go with him?
- Don't look at me. Go, go, go.

03:27.054 --> 03:30.423
- So you fell off your bike?
- Yes. He fell.

03:30.599 --> 03:32.010
How fast were you going, bud?

03:32.184 --> 03:34.888
Not fast. He just fell awkwardly.

03:36.355 --> 03:37.600
Okay.

03:38.023 --> 03:40.265
Well, let's get some x-rays.

03:40.442 --> 03:41.770
I'll be right back.

03:45.030 --> 03:46.358
How is she?

03:46.531 --> 03:48.275
Open comminuted Galeazzi fracture.

03:48.450 --> 03:51.285
She's headed to the OR
for a washout and internal fixation.

03:51.453 --> 03:53.825
The ankle sprain is no longer
her biggest concern.

03:53.997 --> 03:55.112
I checked with lawyers.

03:55.290 --> 03:58.374
Because she refused to get out
of the ambulance before it was hit...

03:58.543 --> 04:00.287
she was not on hospital property.

04:00.504 --> 04:03.588
So the hospital and I
have zero liability.

04:03.757 --> 04:06.046
She has to sue the city.
I'm off the hook.

04:06.802 --> 04:09.423
- How great is that?
- You should throw a party.

04:10.555 --> 04:13.889
<i>- Interns, report to their station now.</i>
- Lidocaine.

04:14.059 --> 04:17.178
<i>- Interns, report to their...</i>
- Let's see what we have under here.

04:17.521 --> 04:20.771
Oh, man. You still with us, Paul?

04:20.940 --> 04:23.396
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

04:25.696 --> 04:28.862
It turns out our friend here
tried to rob a gas station...

04:29.032 --> 04:30.859
and the attendant wasn't having it.

04:31.034 --> 04:34.368
Get him to the OR, tell the cops
they can question him in a few hours.

04:34.538 --> 04:35.996
Topher, your wife just called.

04:36.164 --> 04:38.323
She wants you to bring home
haemorrhoid meds.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.908
The magic is still alive!

04:41.086 --> 04:44.003
There's no way the kid
fractured his arm falling off a bike.

04:44.172 --> 04:47.422
His mom won't let him answer.
It's like he doesn't wanna answer...

04:47.592 --> 04:49.087
or he can't. I don't know.

04:49.261 --> 04:52.926
Normally I'd just call a social worker,
but I can't put my finger on it.

04:53.098 --> 04:54.473
The boy just seems off.

04:54.641 --> 04:58.591
Okay, let's get a nurse, split the mom
up for paperwork and talk to him alone.

05:01.106 --> 05:03.478
This is Nick. Let's move.

05:05.694 --> 05:08.944
EMS said the ambulance was 30
minutes out, so I brought him in.

05:09.114 --> 05:12.862
Armour-piercing went through his vest.
I haven't been able to stop bleeding.

05:13.035 --> 05:16.866
- He passed out three minutes ago.
- Losing his pulse. Crack the chest.

05:18.331 --> 05:19.576
Okay, come on.

05:19.750 --> 05:23.035
I want four units running
on the rapid infuser, five minutes ago.

05:23.211 --> 05:27.375
Send off a CBC, a chem-20
and grab all the O-neg you can find.

05:27.549 --> 05:28.747
Hang on, Nick.

05:28.925 --> 05:31.499
Somebody call Dr. Flannery Mills
at Cardiac Institute.

05:31.678 --> 05:33.920
Tell her to get her ass over here now.
Now!

05:34.348 --> 05:37.763
Insert the rib spreader
and start cranking it.

05:41.188 --> 05:44.189
- How much do I open the ribs?
- Until you hear them crack.

05:46.818 --> 05:48.313
Whoa, that's a huge heart.

05:49.696 --> 05:52.483
It's not his original one.
He's been shot before.

05:52.657 --> 05:54.864
<i>We were in the same platoon
in the war.</i>

05:55.035 --> 05:56.743
<i>We had to find him a new one.</i>

05:57.537 --> 06:00.823
- This was a transplant?
- Yeah, from my brother.

06:02.042 --> 06:03.121
Okay, suction, please.

06:16.264 --> 06:18.008
- Hey, what's up?
- It's Nick.

06:19.601 --> 06:20.632
What's the story?

06:20.811 --> 06:23.480
GSW to the left ventricle.
I got my finger in the hole.

06:23.647 --> 06:25.390
I need you to cross-clamp the aorta.

06:25.565 --> 06:26.810
Clamp.

06:29.736 --> 06:31.195
Put your finger where mine is.

06:31.363 --> 06:32.822
- Yeah.
- I'm through the cords.

06:32.989 --> 06:34.614
Two-0 silk.

06:35.242 --> 06:36.950
Retractor.

06:43.667 --> 06:46.288
Damn it. I can't get the angle.

06:47.671 --> 06:50.791
- T, if this is too hard, we can do this.
- Suction, please.

06:55.512 --> 06:58.347
So we need you
to cover these cases...

06:58.515 --> 07:02.264
to free up the attendings for the...
The real emergencies.

07:02.436 --> 07:04.642
Fantastic. I'm 100 percent ready.

07:04.813 --> 07:09.605
And listen, I'm more into diagnosis
than surgery anyway, so like...

07:09.776 --> 07:12.314
Well, then, this is perfect.

07:15.741 --> 07:16.939
Does this hurt?

07:18.994 --> 07:21.236
Anthony?
Does this hurt when I touch it?

07:21.788 --> 07:23.615
A little.

07:24.124 --> 07:25.702
Where am I?

07:25.876 --> 07:27.584
You're in a hospital.

07:28.170 --> 07:29.961
Remember your mother
bringing you in?

07:30.297 --> 07:32.005
No, not really.

07:32.174 --> 07:34.712
Can you remember anything
about how you got hurt?

07:34.885 --> 07:36.545
Did somebody hit you?

07:36.928 --> 07:39.598
- Did you fall?
- I don't know.

07:40.140 --> 07:41.765
You can tell us.

07:41.933 --> 07:43.132
It'll be our secret.

07:43.477 --> 07:45.303
I don't know.

07:45.896 --> 07:47.307
Where am I again?

07:49.107 --> 07:51.942
Okay. Hey, you wanna play a game
on my phone?

07:54.112 --> 07:55.488
Okay.

08:02.204 --> 08:04.825
Multiple rib fractures,
various stages of healing.

08:04.998 --> 08:06.706
He's been treated somewhere.

08:06.875 --> 08:09.544
- Time to call Child Services?
- Not yet.

08:09.711 --> 08:12.712
They're too overwhelmed.
They'll just bury them in the system.

08:12.881 --> 08:15.253
He's been traumatised,
physically and emotionally.

08:15.425 --> 08:16.754
- By the mother?
- Possibly.

08:16.927 --> 08:18.006
Or a relative.

08:18.178 --> 08:20.716
But something's clearly off.

08:20.889 --> 08:23.760
To find out, I need time
to run an MMSE and APS tests.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.891
I can't hold him with a fractured arm.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.271
Unless, of course,
there was another diagnosis.

08:29.439 --> 08:32.061
What if I were to admit him
for concussion syndrome?

08:32.234 --> 08:35.188
Say he's complaining of headaches,
say from the bike fall.

08:35.361 --> 08:38.197
- That'll buy you a bit of time.
- That's great. Thank you.

08:38.365 --> 08:41.200
I'll start the mom's background check,
run the boy's tests.

08:41.368 --> 08:42.613
Perfect.

08:46.832 --> 08:49.583
Mrs. Franklin, hi.

08:49.751 --> 08:51.625
I am Dr. Cummings.

08:51.795 --> 08:54.879
Okay. Well, what can I help you with
this evening?

08:55.048 --> 08:57.207
It burns.

08:57.384 --> 08:59.839
- What burns?
- Down here.

09:00.012 --> 09:04.092
I think that A-hole Charlie Knight
gave me an STD.

09:04.641 --> 09:07.049
STD? Okay.

09:07.436 --> 09:09.594
Sure, that...

09:10.355 --> 09:13.689
Wait a minute, this is a... This is a joke.
I know what this is, okay?

09:13.859 --> 09:16.729
Kenny? Kenny? Nice try, buddy.

09:16.903 --> 09:19.359
Nice...
Kenny put you up to this, obviously.

09:19.656 --> 09:22.028
Do these sores look like a joke
to you?

09:22.576 --> 09:24.319
Oh, my...

09:28.415 --> 09:30.704
Come on. Come on. Let's go again.

09:30.876 --> 09:32.453
- Clear.
- Clear.

09:33.337 --> 09:35.246
Still V-fib.

09:35.422 --> 09:37.046
T, it's been 20 minutes.

09:37.215 --> 09:38.460
Bolus Lidocaine, let's go.

09:38.633 --> 09:40.756
Krista, increase the joules.

09:43.972 --> 09:45.799
- Clear.
- Clear.

09:47.267 --> 09:49.094
- Got a pulse.
- Yes.

09:49.269 --> 09:51.345
You are not gonna die, Nick.
Do you hear me?

09:51.521 --> 09:53.099
You are not gonna die.

09:53.440 --> 09:57.817
T, listen, you did great, but...

09:57.986 --> 10:00.821
He needs a heart surgeon to fix this
or he'll code again.

10:00.989 --> 10:02.982
Yeah,
that's why I had them call Flannery.

10:07.079 --> 10:08.537
<i>Dr. Calville, 3528.</i>

10:08.705 --> 10:10.828
<i>- Dr. Calville, 3528.</i>
- Hi. Hi.

10:10.999 --> 10:13.870
Listen, is there any way somebody
could take my patient or...

10:14.044 --> 10:15.289
No.

10:18.924 --> 10:21.545
- TC.
- We're gonna figure this out, Debbie.

10:21.718 --> 10:26.464
We stabilised Nick,
but he has damage to his heart.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.309
- Oh, God.
- We fixed the hole in his ventricle.

10:29.476 --> 10:31.634
We'll get him on meds
to help his heart beat.

10:31.812 --> 10:34.137
I'll fix whatever these butcher's
screwed up.

10:34.314 --> 10:35.643
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hi.

10:35.816 --> 10:37.226
Hey.

10:38.318 --> 10:40.441
Dr. Flannery Mills,
Dr. Jordan Alexander.

10:40.612 --> 10:43.815
- Jor... As in "Jordan" Jordan?
- Yeah.

10:45.283 --> 10:47.110
Hold on a second here.

10:48.662 --> 10:50.868
We already have a cardiac surgeon
on call.

10:51.289 --> 10:54.125
- Who's not as good as Flannery.
- I am aware of your work...

10:54.292 --> 10:56.368
with Doctors Without Borders,
Dr. Mills.

10:56.545 --> 10:59.629
But you don't have surgical
privileges at this hospital, sorry.

10:59.798 --> 11:02.087
- If it were up to me...
- I swear, I'm gonna get...

11:02.259 --> 11:04.133
- Get your hands off of me!
- Hey, chill.

11:04.302 --> 11:06.710
Just take Debbie and Flannery in
to see Nick.

11:08.181 --> 11:12.393
Hey, what are we all standing
around for? Let's get back to work.

11:16.398 --> 11:20.016
I can't just make it happen
because the patient is his friend.

11:20.193 --> 11:22.945
She'd have to be approved
by the committee. Not my call.

11:23.113 --> 11:26.363
I know, but it's not just a friend.

11:27.075 --> 11:29.613
TC's brother, Thad...

11:30.120 --> 11:33.703
was killed in action
four years ago in Afghanistan.

11:33.874 --> 11:37.492
He donated his brother's heart
to Nick.

11:37.669 --> 11:40.706
Flannery performed the transplant
when we were over there.

11:42.215 --> 11:45.300
I didn't know that.
Would have been nice to know that.

11:45.469 --> 11:47.508
You know how good she is.

11:47.679 --> 11:50.597
She is better than any cardiac surgeon
we have.

11:51.475 --> 11:54.345
Just get the board to grant her
the surgical privileges.

11:54.519 --> 11:56.393
You can do that.

11:57.564 --> 12:01.644
Don't let your issues with TC
screw up Nick's best chance.

12:21.338 --> 12:23.377
Sir, you're gonna have to wait.

12:23.548 --> 12:25.624
We have several critical patients
right now.

12:25.801 --> 12:28.374
- Well, I'm critical. I'm in pain.
- Come on, not again.

12:28.553 --> 12:30.511
- You have to go.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

12:30.681 --> 12:34.215
But I'm having a severe migraine
and I came in once before for the same.

12:34.393 --> 12:36.101
I got some kind of headache shot...

12:36.269 --> 12:38.179
- Once, huh?
- Yeah, it started with a D.

12:38.355 --> 12:41.688
Dude, stop it. I have seen you here
at least twice this week.

12:41.858 --> 12:43.436
And I bet the day shift has too.

12:43.610 --> 12:46.860
And I told you last time,
I'm not giving you any more drugs.

12:47.030 --> 12:48.690
No one here is giving you drugs.

12:48.865 --> 12:52.365
I'm calling every hospital and
making sure they know who you are.

12:52.536 --> 12:54.861
So get out and get into a programme.

12:55.038 --> 12:56.367
Mollie, can you?

12:58.709 --> 13:02.243
Can we be done?
We've been talking forever.

13:02.421 --> 13:04.129
I'm so tired.

13:04.297 --> 13:07.215
I know you are, Anthony,
but just a few more questions.

13:07.676 --> 13:10.048
I need you to tell me
about your mom and dad now.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.296
I told you,
I don't wanna talk about it.

13:12.472 --> 13:13.801
I wanna go to sleep.

13:13.974 --> 13:15.302
Is your dad still around?

13:16.476 --> 13:18.018
Was he mean?

13:18.186 --> 13:21.520
What about your mom? Is she mean?

13:24.109 --> 13:27.193
You are so pretty. I love your hair.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.656
- Thank you.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

13:33.827 --> 13:35.654
- No.
- Me neither.

13:35.829 --> 13:36.992
I don't like boys.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.121
Well, I like Anthony. He's nice.

13:39.291 --> 13:42.826
But I don't like him like him.
Oh, my gosh.

13:44.004 --> 13:48.962
I'm sorry. My brain is just so tired,
I completely forgot your name.

13:49.134 --> 13:53.547
- Who are you again?
- I'm Gracie. Anthony's friend.

13:55.515 --> 13:57.674
So they get every American
they can find...

13:57.851 --> 13:59.808
to attend Rumsfeld's speech,
right?

13:59.978 --> 14:02.469
Rumsfeld's taking questions,
all scripted, of course.

14:02.647 --> 14:05.565
This one here jumps up on stage
and starts challenging him...

14:05.734 --> 14:07.477
about the lack of Humvee Armour.

14:07.652 --> 14:12.279
He throws a bag of boots on the stage
that used to belong to soldiers...

14:12.449 --> 14:14.525
- who had their legs amputated.
- No way.

14:14.701 --> 14:17.406
You see a pattern
after your hundredth amputation.

14:17.579 --> 14:20.782
Rumsfeld's limo in D.C. Had more
Armour plating than anything...

14:20.957 --> 14:22.915
Take it easy, Irish, I'm on your side.

14:23.085 --> 14:25.161
So they literally have to physically...

14:25.337 --> 14:28.042
drag TC off the stage
while he's yelling for Armour.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.088
Nick and I jump in
trying to help him...

14:30.258 --> 14:32.880
and I get punched in the head
by an MP guy.

14:33.053 --> 14:34.251
The place went nuts.

14:34.429 --> 14:36.469
Every soldier was on his feet,
cheering.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.890
Next thing I know, he's being shipped
home, discharged.

14:40.060 --> 14:42.765
- Political BS.
- If it had been your first incident, yes.

14:42.938 --> 14:44.598
You went through your nine lives.

14:44.773 --> 14:47.229
Yeah, I'm surprised
you didn't end up in the brig.

14:47.401 --> 14:50.152
Hey, Debbie.
We're gonna try and fix Nick's heart...

14:50.320 --> 14:52.894
but there's nothing we can do
about his ugly mug.

14:53.073 --> 14:56.608
- That's okay. I've gotten used to it.
- Oh, hey...

14:56.827 --> 14:58.784
Oh, hey.

14:58.954 --> 15:02.074
All right, let's give Nick some rest
and me space to examine him.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.656
Clear out. Come on, guys.

15:11.550 --> 15:13.922
No matter what happens to me...

15:15.178 --> 15:17.218
you take good care of Debbie.

15:17.389 --> 15:19.678
That's a strong heart you got there.

15:19.850 --> 15:21.427
You're not going anywhere.

15:28.650 --> 15:31.224
And so, Mrs. Franklin...

15:31.403 --> 15:36.361
you say that you have had multiple
sexual partners in the past six months?

15:36.700 --> 15:39.273
I'd say at least eight.

15:40.078 --> 15:44.290
There's a group of us
that all sleep around together.

15:44.458 --> 15:47.909
You can only play
so much mah-jongg, right?

15:48.086 --> 15:50.126
Yeah, right, right. Okay.

15:50.297 --> 15:54.129
Well, they should all come in
to be examined.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.673
Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?

15:57.220 --> 15:59.628
No. No, I would not.

15:59.806 --> 16:02.558
Listen, I need to take
a blood sample...

16:02.726 --> 16:07.518
as well as a swab of your sores
and also your cervix.

16:07.689 --> 16:11.023
You better not take a picture
and put it on the Internet.

16:12.194 --> 16:15.360
No. No, your vagina is safe with me.

16:17.699 --> 16:21.911
Yeah, so TC and I met over there
and been bros ever since.

16:22.079 --> 16:24.451
- Did you know his brother?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:24.623 --> 16:26.948
I mean, actually that's how we met.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.996
Yeah, Thad and I were in a platoon
together.

16:30.170 --> 16:33.420
You should let the nurses sit
because they're on their feet more.

16:33.590 --> 16:34.965
Yeah, of course.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.805
Okay, no, no.

16:40.972 --> 16:44.472
It's very funny.
You glued a chair to my ass.

16:44.643 --> 16:47.395
We're gonna need that chair back,
Krista.

16:47.646 --> 16:49.389
Oh, you want your chair back?

16:49.564 --> 16:51.640
Okay. It's...

16:52.067 --> 16:55.650
That's okay. It's all right.
Everybody, you take a good look...

16:55.821 --> 16:59.320
because I worked hard for this.

16:59.533 --> 17:01.027
All right.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.192
You look good.

17:04.579 --> 17:06.239
Oh, my God.

17:07.958 --> 17:10.663
- Check it out. Right now.
- What's going on?

17:13.880 --> 17:16.371
It's Topher's junkie.

17:20.929 --> 17:21.960
Son of a bitch.

17:22.180 --> 17:24.387
It's not bipolar or schizophrenia.

17:24.558 --> 17:27.227
It's definitely some form
of multiple personality.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.470
Gracie is an 11 -year-old girl alter.

17:29.646 --> 17:32.184
Comes out to protect Anthony
when he feels pushed...

17:32.357 --> 17:34.895
about something
he doesn't wanna talk about.

17:35.068 --> 17:39.647
This is a picture she drew of herself.

17:40.782 --> 17:42.656
And that's brought on by abuse?

17:42.826 --> 17:45.234
Trauma-related to something
in early childhood.

17:45.412 --> 17:48.413
Could be physical,
emotional or both.

17:48.582 --> 17:50.907
But if he's showing symptoms,
it had to be bad.

17:51.084 --> 17:52.115
What's the next step?

17:52.294 --> 17:55.663
Bring out more of the personalities.
There's probably more.

17:55.839 --> 17:58.295
One of them knows the truth
about what's happening.

17:58.467 --> 18:00.424
Anthony's sleeping now
so I have to wait.

18:00.594 --> 18:03.132
We're still waiting on the mother's
background check.

18:03.305 --> 18:06.341
Get Ragosa to expedite that.
He's good at cutting through crap.

18:06.516 --> 18:09.387
Jordan. We got a jumper
at the food trucks from our roof.

18:09.728 --> 18:10.759
What? Who?

18:10.937 --> 18:13.428
Topher's junkie
made his way up there, took a flyer.

18:13.607 --> 18:15.564
Topher's on it.
We also have four MVAs.

18:15.734 --> 18:17.062
Okay.

18:17.235 --> 18:19.940
One hundred grams of mannitol
and hyperventilate him.

18:20.405 --> 18:23.940
- Where the hell is neurosurgery?
- I lost his pulse. There's no profusion...

18:24.117 --> 18:26.276
I heard you. I...
Krista, start compressions.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.244
Heather, push an amp of epi
right now.

18:28.413 --> 18:31.829
Come on, let's go. People. We're
gonna do our best to keep him alive...

18:32.000 --> 18:35.120
because God knows we didn't do
very much when he needed it.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.794
Hey.

18:43.011 --> 18:44.042
You wanted to see me?

18:45.138 --> 18:46.680
Yeah.

18:48.850 --> 18:50.558
I can't fix Nick's heart.

18:50.727 --> 18:54.428
Bullet shredded the semi lunar plane,
the valves, the conduction system.

18:54.606 --> 18:56.515
It's amazing the heart's beating
at all.

18:56.692 --> 18:57.854
So he needs a new one.

18:58.193 --> 19:01.609
Which he will probably never get
because this one was already a donor.

19:01.780 --> 19:04.864
I can put him on ECMO, repair the valve,
maybe buy him a month.

19:05.033 --> 19:07.951
We'll get him on a list,
maybe get lucky...

19:08.120 --> 19:09.697
but I'm not optimistic.

19:11.164 --> 19:12.196
Have you told TC?

19:12.374 --> 19:16.751
No. I'm not sure how he's gonna take it.
I've seen him spiral pretty bad.

19:16.920 --> 19:21.463
I mean, nothing like what you've seen
or lived through with him, but...

19:22.134 --> 19:24.375
I thought you should be here
when I tell him.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.258
You know we're not together anymore,
right?

19:28.015 --> 19:29.972
Does it really matter?

19:32.811 --> 19:34.222
Hey.

19:34.730 --> 19:36.140
What's going on?

19:48.076 --> 19:51.410
If you have unclaimed DOAs,
we're looking for a heart for transplant.

19:51.580 --> 19:53.905
We're on every list.
Check for any recent deaths.

19:54.082 --> 19:56.917
But I don't understand.
He looked like he was doing better.

19:57.085 --> 20:00.371
Yeah, he's stable for now,
but he needs a new heart.

20:00.547 --> 20:03.418
There's... There was... There was...
It was just too much.

20:03.592 --> 20:05.549
Not again, TC.

20:05.719 --> 20:07.047
He's not strong enough.

20:07.220 --> 20:08.798
- Please.
- Why is this happening?

20:08.972 --> 20:10.881
He is a good man.

20:11.058 --> 20:13.216
He goes to church.
He helps everybody.

20:13.393 --> 20:16.976
- I don't know, Debbie.
- What am I gonna do without him?

20:17.272 --> 20:20.606
What are our kids gonna do
without their father?

20:21.026 --> 20:24.976
I'm begging you, TC,
you have to save him.

20:25.530 --> 20:27.689
- Please.
- Okay.

20:27.866 --> 20:30.867
- Please.
- I will, I will. I promise, okay?

20:31.036 --> 20:34.405
Well, sergeant,
then get me your supervisor.

20:34.581 --> 20:37.286
- Who called Child Services?
- It had to be a nosy patient.

20:37.459 --> 20:39.665
Everybody here knew
what we were doing.

20:39.836 --> 20:41.746
Are you the supervisor?

20:41.922 --> 20:44.876
You know what's going on?
Good. Good.

20:45.050 --> 20:46.425
Here's what you're gonna do.

20:46.593 --> 20:49.131
You're gonna get me that background
on the mother...

20:49.304 --> 20:51.213
or I'm gonna wake up
your bosses...

20:51.390 --> 20:54.225
and I'm gonna tell them
you can't handle your job, okay?

20:54.393 --> 20:55.935
Then we'll see what...

20:56.728 --> 20:58.685
Good.

20:58.855 --> 21:00.266
Very good.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.766
Great. Thank you.

21:02.943 --> 21:05.564
- It's on its way.
- Good, because so is Child Services.

21:23.547 --> 21:24.661
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.959
How's that kid doing?
Mom's abusing him, right?

21:30.595 --> 21:33.680
I don't know. I'm not sure yet.
He's too exhausted to talk.

21:33.849 --> 21:36.850
I wanted to tell you
I spoke with Nick's wife.

21:37.019 --> 21:38.477
She's very much in shock.

21:38.645 --> 21:42.180
Yeah, yeah.
This is pretty tough on her.

21:43.066 --> 21:46.067
I would imagine
it's pretty tough on you too.

21:46.528 --> 21:48.437
She told me how close
you and Nick are.

21:48.613 --> 21:51.614
- Yeah. Yup.
- From the Army, right?

21:51.783 --> 21:53.277
Yeah.

21:54.828 --> 22:00.368
Look, TC, I get that
we keep things pretty casual...

22:00.542 --> 22:03.080
between us, relationship-wise...

22:03.253 --> 22:06.669
but that doesn't mean
we can't talk.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.248
- If you need to...
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:09.426 --> 22:12.593
I don't need to, all right? Thanks.

22:13.472 --> 22:17.635
Maybe you don't need to.
Maybe you just want to.

22:23.982 --> 22:26.853
Nick... Nick got shot...

22:27.152 --> 22:30.438
in an attack on our base...

22:30.614 --> 22:32.903
just before my brother Thad died.

22:33.408 --> 22:35.531
That must have been a terrible day.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.825
Yeah. Yeah.

22:38.747 --> 22:40.289
You know what's crazy?

22:41.833 --> 22:45.037
We were getting back
at Nick's shooters...

22:45.212 --> 22:47.703
and that's what got Thad killed.

22:48.382 --> 22:51.051
He was pissed off about Nick and...

22:51.468 --> 22:55.466
Well, then Nick ends up
with Thad's heart.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.309
So it felt like a part of Thad
was still with you.

23:01.395 --> 23:02.937
Yeah.

23:04.523 --> 23:07.192
Yeah, I guess until tonight.

23:07.359 --> 23:09.019
I guess.

23:10.529 --> 23:12.771
I should go check up on Nick.

23:13.448 --> 23:15.774
Landry, thanks.

23:18.745 --> 23:21.948
Make way, coming through!
We got a multiple casualty MVA.

23:22.124 --> 23:24.911
A car ran a red light
and ploughed into the wedding party.

23:25.085 --> 23:28.121
- Bride into Trauma Three.
- Forehead lac and L-sided pneumo.

23:28.296 --> 23:31.333
- Driver has injury to the hand.
- Get this woman to Trauma Two.

23:31.508 --> 23:33.299
Okay, Drew, you're on the groom.

23:33.468 --> 23:36.090
TC, you take the maid of honour,
I'll take the bride.

23:36.263 --> 23:39.466
Limo driver, Curtain One over there.
Maid of honour, Trauma Four.

23:39.933 --> 23:42.139
I need you right down here, okay?
Let's go.

23:42.310 --> 23:43.473
Come on, let's go.

23:43.645 --> 23:47.690
I want two 14-gauge antecubital lines
and set me up for a chest tube.

23:47.858 --> 23:50.265
- How's the bride, Jordan?
- FAST is positive.

23:50.444 --> 23:53.895
Looks like a grade-three splenic
laceration. Call the OR. Drew?

23:54.072 --> 23:56.195
Multiple palpable fractures,
but no flail.

23:56.366 --> 23:58.359
Doing an intercostal nerve block
now.

24:04.958 --> 24:09.003
So I've put a call into the state police
to try to cut through the red tape...

24:09.171 --> 24:11.294
to get information
on that boy's mother.

24:11.465 --> 24:14.466
I hate that part of the job.
Let me know if you hear anything.

24:14.634 --> 24:18.335
Sure. Listen, while I have you...

24:18.513 --> 24:21.680
I'd like to get your professional
opinion of Dr. Callahan.

24:21.850 --> 24:23.261
He's an excellent doctor.

24:23.435 --> 24:25.724
No, no, I mean his state of mind.

24:25.896 --> 24:28.054
Any signs of PTSD?

24:28.231 --> 24:30.604
Well, everybody who was over there
has some signs.

24:30.776 --> 24:33.812
- Topher, Drew.
- I'm more focused on TC.

24:33.987 --> 24:36.229
The fighting, the gambling,
the drinking...

24:36.406 --> 24:37.651
sudden burst of anger.

24:37.824 --> 24:40.778
You really don't like him.
What is the deal with you guys?

24:41.536 --> 24:43.992
- What do you mean?
- I've been working here a month.

24:44.164 --> 24:47.498
Every time you and TC are in a room,
you wanna tear each other's heads off.

24:47.668 --> 24:51.250
- What is that about?
- You're doing that shrink thing.

24:51.421 --> 24:52.915
Somebody asks you a question...

24:53.090 --> 24:55.462
you turn it around
to try to get information.

24:56.134 --> 25:00.084
Actually, I was just generally curious,
but if you don't wanna answer, I get it.

25:00.931 --> 25:02.722
Nice try.

25:02.891 --> 25:07.138
I'll let you know if I hear anything from
the state police about the boy's mom.

25:09.272 --> 25:12.273
Your daughter had internal bleeding
due to a spleen injury...

25:12.442 --> 25:14.649
but she's gonna be fine.

25:14.820 --> 25:19.031
- But what about Darrell?
- As is everyone else in your party.

25:43.515 --> 25:45.140
Hey there, Paul. How'd it go?

25:45.726 --> 25:48.892
- You knew she had an STD, didn't you?
- Of course I knew.

25:49.062 --> 25:52.348
Mrs. Franklin comes in a couple
of times a year with those sores.

25:52.983 --> 25:54.062
Gross.

25:54.234 --> 25:57.852
STDs are all over retirement centres.
It's like a porno shoot over there.

25:58.155 --> 26:00.990
And Paul, there's more coming in
who need the same exam.

26:01.158 --> 26:03.364
Oh, come on.

26:03.618 --> 26:07.663
Oh, and, doctor, make sure you give
them a real thorough pelvic exam.

26:07.873 --> 26:10.245
You wouldn't wanna miss
anything, now, would you?

26:13.420 --> 26:14.665
Yes.

26:15.005 --> 26:16.036
That's good.

26:16.214 --> 26:17.792
Oh, God.

26:17.966 --> 26:20.291
So, what's the story, Skeezix?

26:20.469 --> 26:23.304
That whore Wendy Franklin
give me the clap or not?

26:23.472 --> 26:25.760
Well, definitely you got it. You got it.

26:25.932 --> 26:28.055
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26:32.773 --> 26:34.730
Hey. What the hell are you doing?

26:34.900 --> 26:36.442
Shaving his beard.

26:36.610 --> 26:37.890
As a practical joke.

26:38.320 --> 26:42.187
We've been trying for like three years
to get him to shave it, but he won't.

26:42.366 --> 26:44.607
We even offered him,
what was it, 3600 bucks...

26:44.785 --> 26:47.454
to get him to shave it one time,
he still wouldn't.

26:47.621 --> 26:49.910
Come on, it'll be a great joke.

26:50.082 --> 26:52.573
My sister practically married him
for this beard.

26:52.751 --> 26:55.456
It'll make everybody laugh
and we all need it.

26:58.423 --> 26:59.538
It's pretty good.

27:01.176 --> 27:02.884
Okay, then. Start shaving.

27:03.053 --> 27:04.677
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

27:04.846 --> 27:07.005
Come on, let's go, let's go.

27:09.810 --> 27:12.098
All right, Drew. So, what's the deal?

27:12.270 --> 27:14.940
Are you gonna break up
with your girlfriend or what?

27:15.107 --> 27:17.645
I don't know.
I don't wanna do it over the phone...

27:17.818 --> 27:20.439
so, you know,
maybe when she gets back into town.

27:20.612 --> 27:22.237
- Is that good for you?
- Seriously?

27:22.406 --> 27:23.568
Dude, have it all set...

27:23.740 --> 27:25.069
- Oh, hey, what the...?
- What?

27:25.242 --> 27:27.815
- That's wrong.
- What the?

27:30.038 --> 27:31.698
What the...? Oh, man.

27:37.713 --> 27:40.120
He's only 12 years old.

27:40.298 --> 27:43.418
I didn't do anything.
I would never hurt him.

27:43.593 --> 27:46.962
We have records from hospitals
in Galveston, Lubbock, Oklahoma City.

27:47.139 --> 27:49.594
You're taking him to different ERs
so nobody knows.

27:49.766 --> 27:51.474
You need to tell us the truth now.

27:51.643 --> 27:53.102
I swear, I didn't do anything.

27:53.270 --> 27:56.970
His multiple personalities started
in order to try to survive something.

27:57.149 --> 27:59.984
Why didn't you mention them?
What are you hiding?

28:00.152 --> 28:03.521
- I'm getting out of here.
- I swear, if you are hurting this boy...

28:12.039 --> 28:13.581
Who is doing this to you?

28:13.749 --> 28:16.418
Tell me what's going on,
or I'm gonna have you arrested.

28:18.670 --> 28:21.671
- Temp's down to 94 degrees.
- Turn down the cooling blanket.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.500
We wanna get it down to around 90.

28:23.675 --> 28:25.715
Best chance
of preserving brain function.

28:25.886 --> 28:29.136
You're still working on this jumper
while Nick needs a heart?

28:29.306 --> 28:31.345
- Are you gonna call this or what?
- Not yet.

28:32.476 --> 28:34.599
It's been hours.

28:35.562 --> 28:38.018
His pupils are fixed and dilated.

28:38.190 --> 28:41.025
His EEG is flat.

28:42.027 --> 28:44.103
- No response to painful stimuli.
- Stop.

28:44.279 --> 28:47.446
Stop! There is no medical reason
to keep working on this junkie.

28:47.616 --> 28:49.027
His name is William.

28:49.368 --> 28:52.902
I just... I want to keep him hooked up
until his parents get here, okay?

28:53.080 --> 28:54.989
Nick is not gonna get a heart...

28:55.165 --> 28:58.119
and you've got this guy
who is brain-dead.

28:58.293 --> 29:00.914
This is not the battlefield, T.

29:01.296 --> 29:04.546
We don't have to keep making
these instant choices anymore.

29:04.925 --> 29:08.128
Nick needs a heart right now.

29:08.303 --> 29:12.171
And I know it kills you to quit,
but no matter what you do...

29:12.599 --> 29:14.259
you're not gonna save this kid.

29:15.936 --> 29:18.806
His brain was dead
when he hit that truck.

29:24.861 --> 29:27.150
There is a waiting list.
Can you just jump it?

29:27.322 --> 29:30.074
There's a way around it.
It's called direct donation.

29:30.242 --> 29:33.408
The family decides who to give
the organs to if he's not a donor.

29:33.578 --> 29:35.405
That's what I did
with my brother for Nick.

29:35.580 --> 29:38.071
It's what I have to talk them
into doing for him now.

29:39.042 --> 29:41.996
Heil, heil, Hitler.

29:42.629 --> 29:44.622
Hey.

29:44.798 --> 29:46.126
Hey, look who's waking up.

29:46.758 --> 29:51.716
I just wanted you to see the faces
of the people who saved your ass.

30:00.522 --> 30:02.598
You shaved me?

30:03.525 --> 30:06.692
Oh, God, I'm gonna sue you.
I'm gonna sue all of your asses.

30:06.862 --> 30:10.231
Well, make sure you hire a Jew,
because I hear they're really smart.

30:10.407 --> 30:11.985
Oh, yeah.

30:13.827 --> 30:15.202
Your wife's here to see you.

30:17.414 --> 30:19.407
Guess she didn't know, either.

30:24.671 --> 30:27.079
T, you cannot move him
into pre-op...

30:27.257 --> 30:30.258
and start prepping him
for a transplant without asking me.

30:30.427 --> 30:33.428
He has no donor card and you haven't
consulted with the family.

30:33.597 --> 30:35.471
I'm not cutting him.
I'm being prepared.

30:35.640 --> 30:39.175
If Nick goes south and his family
says yes, then we can prep him faster.

30:39.353 --> 30:41.262
I just wanna be a few steps ahead.

30:41.438 --> 30:44.190
You are way more
than a few steps ahead.

30:44.358 --> 30:48.604
Look, even if the family gives consent,
they might wanna wait weeks, okay?

30:48.779 --> 30:49.810
Months, even.

30:49.988 --> 30:53.025
- We don't know how long he's gonna...
- Okay, I know. I know.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.616
I just can't...
I just can't not do anything.

30:58.163 --> 31:00.784
I'm gonna talk to his family.
I've been in their shoes.

31:00.957 --> 31:05.086
I had to make the same decision with
my brother. I might get them to say yes.

31:06.421 --> 31:08.829
What am I supposed to do, huh?

31:09.007 --> 31:10.751
Jordan, I...

31:11.093 --> 31:14.094
I can't just let Nick die.
I owe him.

31:14.262 --> 31:17.180
I know how indebted you feel
to Nick.

31:17.349 --> 31:20.054
- He saved your life.
- If I had stepped on that landmine...

31:20.227 --> 31:22.136
I know. I owe him too, okay?

31:22.312 --> 31:23.510
If...

31:23.855 --> 31:26.311
If you had died over there, I just...

31:27.776 --> 31:30.101
You saved his life once.

31:30.278 --> 31:33.694
You gave him your brother's heart
and you gave him four more years...

31:33.865 --> 31:36.617
- he never would've had.
- I wanna give him a few more.

31:36.785 --> 31:40.486
- I know.
- This whole situation, I just...

31:40.664 --> 31:43.665
I feel like I'm reliving Thad
dying all over again...

31:43.834 --> 31:46.751
and I...

31:48.422 --> 31:51.423
I don't like how that makes me feel.
I just...

31:53.760 --> 31:56.334
I thought I put it in here,
and I need to put it away.

31:56.513 --> 32:00.131
I don't think that you could just bury
something like that.

32:00.559 --> 32:03.132
Look, whatever you need,
I will be there to help you...

32:03.311 --> 32:04.426
Excuse me, doctors.

32:04.604 --> 32:06.763
The jumper's parents
are in the lobby.

32:06.940 --> 32:09.146
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- Okay.

32:10.944 --> 32:12.486
Okay.

32:14.614 --> 32:16.524
Let me talk to them.

32:16.742 --> 32:19.493
All right,
let me just explain your situation...

32:19.661 --> 32:23.529
and then you can sit down with them
and tell them your story.

32:24.082 --> 32:28.246
- But, T, we have to do this in steps.
- Yeah. Okay.

32:28.420 --> 32:31.041
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

32:35.135 --> 32:37.092
Anthony, wake up. Wake up.

32:38.096 --> 32:40.587
We're arresting your mother.
We know she hurts you.

32:41.350 --> 32:42.725
No.

32:42.893 --> 32:45.644
We are taking her away
and she will never hurt you again.

32:46.313 --> 32:50.311
- No! Stop it! I said no!
- Anthony...

32:53.111 --> 32:56.112
Back away from me, you whore!
Back away!

32:56.281 --> 32:57.740
Take it easy.

32:58.575 --> 32:59.820
Anthony...

33:00.452 --> 33:02.528
- Anthony, take it easy.
- I'm not Anthony!

33:02.704 --> 33:05.741
Anthony's a sissy! No!

33:07.459 --> 33:09.084
Tell them, you bitch!

33:09.503 --> 33:13.287
Let go of me or I'll kill you!

33:18.053 --> 33:19.761
I'm so sorry.

33:19.930 --> 33:22.337
- Believe me?
- Child Services are on their way...

33:22.516 --> 33:25.137
so we had to try to force the change
in personality.

33:25.310 --> 33:28.679
Now that we know the problem,
we can get him the help he needs.

33:32.109 --> 33:33.769
It's okay.

33:34.069 --> 33:37.568
<i>Dr. McCarthy,
you have a call on line 2285.</i>

33:39.032 --> 33:40.692
Thank you.

33:44.329 --> 33:46.073
Dr. Alexander.

33:47.249 --> 33:48.529
You knew about this?

33:48.709 --> 33:51.496
You were in on this transplant
without permission?

33:51.670 --> 33:54.587
My shift, my responsibility.

33:54.756 --> 33:57.426
Well, it's my ass on the line too,
Jordan.

33:57.592 --> 34:00.843
When you took this job,
you said you could keep him in line.

34:01.346 --> 34:03.505
It's only been two weeks.

34:03.682 --> 34:05.390
Change doesn't happen overnight.

34:05.559 --> 34:08.762
And I know that TC
can be a huge pain in the ass.

34:08.937 --> 34:12.638
Trust me, I've been dealing with him
a hell of a lot longer than anyone else.

34:13.650 --> 34:15.975
But if it were your family...

34:16.737 --> 34:19.310
wouldn't you want us
to cut you some slack?

34:22.868 --> 34:24.695
Excuse me.

34:27.164 --> 34:28.706
Thank you.

34:33.085 --> 34:34.746
Well, congratulations, ma'am.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.871
You are actually the only patient I saw
tonight that did not have an STD, so...

34:39.051 --> 34:40.426
Well, I should think not.

34:40.594 --> 34:42.585
I haven't had sex in 10 years.

34:43.347 --> 34:46.181
But what does this have to do
with my stomach?

34:46.350 --> 34:47.974
I'm sorry, your what?

34:48.143 --> 34:50.812
I came in because my stomach hurts.

34:52.898 --> 34:57.275
Right, well, yeah,
it's all connected, so...

34:59.321 --> 35:00.483
That was wild.

35:00.655 --> 35:03.147
I've never seen anything like that
before.

35:03.325 --> 35:07.239
Kids is always the worst. I feel horrible
putting him through anything, but...

35:07.412 --> 35:10.366
Mother could've been lying
about the kid to protect herself.

35:10.540 --> 35:12.367
I mean, people lie to us all the time.

35:12.542 --> 35:16.374
So I just went over everything
with the woman from Child Services.

35:16.546 --> 35:18.206
Explained the mom
was moving around.

35:18.382 --> 35:21.548
She thought someone would take
her kid if they knew his problem.

35:21.718 --> 35:22.881
Yada, yada, yada.

35:23.053 --> 35:24.761
And that we had it under control.

35:25.347 --> 35:28.798
Well, chalk one up for the good guys.
Anybody for a coffee? My treat.

35:28.975 --> 35:31.846
- I'll catch up to you later.
- Right.

35:34.606 --> 35:37.809
So listen, I just...

35:37.984 --> 35:41.733
I want you to know that anytime
you wanna talk, I'm available.

35:42.072 --> 35:44.741
- Talk?
- Yeah.

35:44.908 --> 35:46.189
Bounce things off me.

35:46.368 --> 35:48.111
Sort things out.

35:48.495 --> 35:51.864
I know Latino men traditionally
don't go into therapy...

35:52.708 --> 35:54.166
Excuse me.

35:57.629 --> 35:59.254
Therapy?

36:00.549 --> 36:04.000
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- Who said anything about wrong?

36:04.970 --> 36:07.840
I just see someone
who looks like they're in pain...

36:08.015 --> 36:09.972
and needs someone to talk to.

36:13.061 --> 36:15.517
What the hell is going on now?

36:15.689 --> 36:19.105
It's a miracle, doctor. We pulled
the patient off the ventilator...

36:19.276 --> 36:20.735
but he started breathing.

36:20.902 --> 36:24.153
Pupils are reactive. Start the
rewarming protocol and order an MRI.

36:24.322 --> 36:27.110
- He's responding to pain.
- Warm saline. Now.

36:27.284 --> 36:29.276
I've never seen this before.

36:29.453 --> 36:31.694
Save him.
Don't take him away from me again.

36:31.872 --> 36:34.410
Please, give him a second chance.

36:36.793 --> 36:38.287
Let's get him to the OR.

36:38.462 --> 36:40.419
I swear to God,
I thought he was gone.

36:40.589 --> 36:42.961
That's why we don't rush
these kinds of decisions.

36:43.133 --> 36:45.126
The neurosurgeon attendant
is an hour out.

36:45.302 --> 36:48.635
We can't wait. We gotta get him
into the OR and do the craniotomy.

36:48.805 --> 36:50.881
He's right.
I'll tell Ragosa and the family.

36:51.058 --> 36:53.928
Can you get somebody
to get me an update on Nick's surgery?

36:54.102 --> 36:55.929
I'll take the lead, okay?

36:57.814 --> 37:00.519
Are you sure you're up for this?
It's been a rough night.

37:00.692 --> 37:03.064
You've never done this.
I'm the kid's best chance.

37:03.236 --> 37:04.612
We got him.

37:05.113 --> 37:06.145
Topher, I promise...

37:07.532 --> 37:09.525
I won't let you or that kid down.

37:14.664 --> 37:16.242
I'm through to the inner table.

37:16.416 --> 37:19.287
Suction that bleeder
and increase power to the drill.

37:20.921 --> 37:23.044
Ragosa and the family
are all caught up.

37:23.215 --> 37:25.457
- How's it going?
- Almost through the skull.

37:25.634 --> 37:28.339
- How's Nick doing?
- Flannery started repairing his valve.

37:28.512 --> 37:31.347
I'll help beat down every door
to get Nick another heart.

37:31.515 --> 37:33.092
- I know.
- Call me if you need me.

37:33.266 --> 37:34.298
Okay. Will do.

37:34.476 --> 37:35.804
Removing the bone flap now.

37:35.977 --> 37:38.136
Hopefully by reducing
intercranial pressure...

37:38.313 --> 37:41.065
- we can jumpstart his blood flow.
- Nice work, buddy.

37:41.233 --> 37:44.399
I did way too many of these
from Humvees driving over IEDs.

37:44.569 --> 37:46.562
Hope it works
and he gets a second chance.

37:46.738 --> 37:48.398
Just do your best, T. You got this.

37:48.949 --> 37:50.858
Okay. Let's go.

37:52.160 --> 37:55.078
- You should've known.
- He's your best friend. You should've.

37:55.247 --> 37:57.405
She's your sister.
You should've checked him.

37:57.582 --> 37:59.741
Might I remind you
we are in a hospital?

37:59.918 --> 38:01.293
Please, just keep it down.

38:01.461 --> 38:04.830
Sorry. She's still in there with him.
Can you go see what's going on?

38:05.007 --> 38:08.422
- It was a long time ago.
- What else haven't you told me?

38:08.593 --> 38:11.049
- I don't even know who you are.
- It'll grow back.

38:11.221 --> 38:13.344
Grow back? It's insane.

38:13.515 --> 38:16.136
Hey, hey, hey.
Is everything okay in here?

38:16.518 --> 38:19.091
No, it's not okay.
Look at his stupid face.

38:19.604 --> 38:23.353
While you're here, go ahead, Darrell,
tell the doctor what you told me.

38:24.026 --> 38:27.975
I got these things when I was into
that crap when I was in high school.

38:28.613 --> 38:30.689
But I'm not anymore,
not for like 10 years.

38:31.366 --> 38:35.316
I didn't wanna get my face scarred from
removing them, so I just grew a beard.

38:35.620 --> 38:38.325
I swear that's the truth.

38:39.207 --> 38:40.915
I love you, Honey-Bunny.

38:42.044 --> 38:43.787
Please forgive me.

38:44.546 --> 38:45.957
Do you believe him?

38:49.384 --> 38:53.049
I think what's important
is if you believe him.

38:53.221 --> 38:55.712
You both should believe me.
I've changed. I swear it.

38:55.891 --> 38:57.800
Shut up, Darrell. Cover up your face.

38:58.060 --> 38:59.091
I'm just...

38:59.269 --> 39:01.309
What else?
Are you in the Taliban too?

39:01.480 --> 39:05.394
- That doesn't even make sense.
- Oh, yeah. Like I'd believe a Nazi.

39:05.776 --> 39:08.563
- So how's it going in there?
- How could you do this to me?

39:08.737 --> 39:09.768
You're overreacting.

39:09.946 --> 39:12.188
- They're working it out.
- You didn't tell me.

39:25.879 --> 39:27.504
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

39:43.814 --> 39:48.274
My wife left me three months ago.

39:49.444 --> 39:51.271
She took my kids too.

39:52.572 --> 39:56.107
They have to sneak in calls to me.

39:57.911 --> 40:00.746
And I don't know what the hell
I'm gonna do without them.

40:52.466 --> 40:54.624
River Walk?
We're not going to River Walk.

40:54.801 --> 40:58.253
- That place is a tourist trap.
- Well, I'm a tourist. I'm new here.

40:58.430 --> 41:00.636
No, we're gonna show you
the real San Antonio.

41:00.807 --> 41:03.298
- Smoke Shack with Gloria.
- Oh, that sounds good.

41:03.477 --> 41:05.553
- All right, so who's buying?
- Paul.

41:05.729 --> 41:08.813
- Wait, what? Why me?
- New guy always buys.

41:08.982 --> 41:11.936
- Oh, come on.
- That's the way it goes.

41:44.476 --> 41:46.136
Ready, buddy?

41:49.314 --> 41:52.019
Come on,
let's go watch some games.
