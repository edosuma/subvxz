THERE'S BEEN SOME BIG PROBLEMS
THAT OCCURRED IN HERE,

00:03.970 --> 00:06.304
FIGHTS, ACCIDENTS.

00:06.306 --> 00:08.474
WHEN YOU WERE HERE
BEFORE IT WAS BAD,

00:08.476 --> 00:11.276
BUT I THINK IT MIGHT'VE
GOTTEN A LITTLE WORSE.

00:11.278 --> 00:13.645
VERY OPPRESSIVE FEELING
IN HERE. YOU OKAY?

00:13.647 --> 00:15.714
IT'S LIKE A SQUEEZING
ON MY HEART.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.917

ARE IN THE BASEMENT?

00:20.988 --> 00:22.487
A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE
COMMUNICATING WITH

00:22.489 --> 00:24.456
IS TIED TO THOSE BONES.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.991
I'M READY TO FACE THIS THING.

Narrator: LAST YEAR,
NICK AND KATRINA ENCOUNTERED

01:21.181 --> 01:25.383
A DARK FORCE AT THE MONROE HOUSE
IN HARTFORD CITY, INDIANA.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.719
CALLED IN TO HELP HOMEOWNER
EDDIE NORRIS,

01:27.721 --> 01:29.855
WHOSE CONSTRUCTION
WAS HALTED BY NEARLY

01:29.857 --> 01:31.924
NON-STOP PARANORMAL ACTIVITY.

01:31.926 --> 01:36.261
NICK AND KATRINA SPENT 72 HOURS
FACING DOWN A DANGEROUS,

01:36.263 --> 01:39.331
AND POTENTIALLY
DEMONIC PRESENCE.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.333
LINGERING ENERGY BROUGHT
IN BY OCCULT ACTIVITY

01:42.335 --> 01:46.004
OVERWHELMED KATRINA ON
THE HOUSE'S UPPER FLOOR.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.773
AFTER SIFTING THROUGH
UNEXPLAINABLE PHENOMENA,

01:48.775 --> 01:51.076
LIKE WET FOOTPRINTS
LEADING TO THE KITCHEN...

01:51.078 --> 01:54.145
Katrina: LOOK AT THIS TRAIL.
IT GOES TO THE KITCHEN.

01:54.147 --> 01:55.747
IT GOES TO THE [BEEP] KITCHEN.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.816
Narrator: ...AND TREMORS SHAKING
THE WHOLE HOUSE...

01:57.818 --> 02:01.119
Nick: DO YOU FEEL THAT?
EVERYBODY GET OUT.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.488
Narrator: ...MYSTERIOUS VOICES
LED THEM TO THE BASEMENT

02:03.490 --> 02:05.724
WHERE THEY MADE
A SHOCKING DISCOVERY.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.359
Nick: HOLY [BLEEP].

02:08.361 --> 02:11.329
Narrator: EDDIE CONTACTED
THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES

02:11.331 --> 02:13.632
BUT THEIR BRIEF INVESTIGATION
INTO THE REMAINS

02:13.634 --> 02:14.832
CAME UP EMPTY.

02:14.834 --> 02:18.136
LEAVING MORE QUESTIONS
THAN ANSWERS.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.471
IN THE MONTHS SINCE
THE FIRST INVESTIGATION,

02:20.473 --> 02:23.175
EDDIE HAS RESUMED
CONSTRUCTION ON THE PROPERTY

02:23.177 --> 02:26.044
HOWEVER THE PARANORMAL
PRESENCE HAS REACHED

02:26.046 --> 02:27.979
A TERRIFYING INTENSITY.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.650
NICK AND KATRINA HAVE CONTINUED
TO RESEARCH THEIR FINDINGS,

02:31.652 --> 02:35.187
HOPING TO BRING TO LIGHT
WHO OR WHAT DREW THEM TO FIND

02:35.189 --> 02:38.457
THESE HUMAN REMAINS
CAUSING THE HORRIFIC HAUNTINGS

02:38.459 --> 02:39.958
AT THE MONROE HOUSE.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.963
Nick: WE NEED TO GET
A PROFESSIONAL,

02:44.965 --> 02:47.432
SCIENTIFIC OPINION
ON THESE SKELETAL REMAINS.

02:50.204 --> 02:53.071
SO WE'RE BRINGING SOME
PICTURES TO DR. TODD DISOTELL

02:53.073 --> 02:56.675
SO WE CAN SEE WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.876
YOU KNOW, WE TALKED
ON THE PHONE.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.477
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THIS LOCATION

02:59.479 --> 03:01.346
THAT WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING
FOR THE LAST YEAR

03:01.348 --> 03:03.949
AND WE HAD FOUND
SKELETAL REMAINS.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.985
SO IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION,
LOOKING AT THESE PHOTOS,

03:06.987 --> 03:10.555
WOULD YOU SAY THESE ARE HUMAN
OR IS IT SOME KIND OF ANIMAL?

03:10.557 --> 03:16.294
UM, I'M QUITE CONFIDENT
THESE ARE HUMAN.

03:16.296 --> 03:19.231
YOU HAVE A HUMOROUS HERE,

03:19.233 --> 03:22.634
THAT'S MISSING
A SHOULDER JOINT

03:22.636 --> 03:25.137
AND MOST OF
THE PARTS OF THE ELBOW.

03:25.139 --> 03:29.374
THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS
LIKE A PARIETAL BONE.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.943
SO THIS WOULD BE ON
THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.

03:31.945 --> 03:35.447
AND YOU CAN'T TELL, OBVIOUSLY,
BY PHOTOS ABOUT AGING

03:35.449 --> 03:36.715
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
NO, THAT'S GONNA BE

03:36.717 --> 03:40.786
COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON
TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY,

03:40.788 --> 03:44.055
THE SOIL ACIDITY,
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

03:44.057 --> 03:48.059
WHAT IS INTRIGUING TO ME,
THOUGH, POSSIBLY,

03:48.061 --> 03:51.229
IS THAT THIS MAY HAVE
BEEN A YOUNGER INDIVIDUAL

03:51.231 --> 03:53.732
WHO WASN'T FULLY ADULT.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.402
WE GOT CONFIRMATION THAT
THESE BONES ARE, INDEED, HUMAN,

03:57.404 --> 03:59.204
SO WE NEEDED TO FURTHER
THIS INVESTIGATION

03:59.206 --> 04:02.840
AND GO BACK TO THE MONROE HOUSE.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.942
IT'S CRAZY TO BE BACK HERE,
AFTER EVERYTHING

04:04.944 --> 04:06.611
WE EXPERIENCED
HERE LAST TIME, TOO.

04:06.613 --> 04:09.214
YEAH, WELL, I MEAN,
THE LAST INVESTIGATION, TOO,

04:09.216 --> 04:10.749
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE FOUND,

04:10.751 --> 04:13.018
WE LEFT WITH WAY MORE
QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.686
YEAH,
SO LET'S GO TALK TO EDDIE.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.354
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT
WHAT HE HAS FOR US.

04:16.356 --> 04:25.964
♪♪

04:25.966 --> 04:28.900
Nick: IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
I REMEMBERED IT.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.169
I'M JUST WONDERING
WHAT GOT STIRRED UP

04:31.171 --> 04:32.704
SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE.
-SINCE WE LEFT, YEAH.

04:32.706 --> 04:36.541
AND, YOU KNOW, NOW IS IT GONNA
BE MUCH WORSE LIVING HERE.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.577
-HEY, GUYS. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
-HI.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.845
-GOOD, HOW YOU DOING?
-GOOD, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.046
THANKS FOR HAVING US BACK.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.447
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR STOPPING BY.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.581
-HEY, GOOD SEEING YOU.
-THANK YOU.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.883
-YEAH, THANK YOU.
-THANKS FOR COMING BACK.

04:44.885 --> 04:49.387
WE WERE JUST REMINISCING
ABOUT OUR STAYCATION HERE

04:49.389 --> 04:52.257
AND I MEAN, WE HAD
CRAZY EXPERIENCES HERE.

04:52.259 --> 04:55.527
BUT I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO
FIND OUT SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE

04:55.529 --> 04:57.329
WHAT HAVE THE EXPERIENCES
BEEN FOR YOU

04:57.331 --> 04:59.397
OR FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE VISITED?

04:59.399 --> 05:01.733
WHEN YOU WERE HERE
BEFORE IT WAS BAD,

05:01.735 --> 05:03.602
BUT, GOD, I DON'T KNOW,

05:03.604 --> 05:05.303
I THINK IT MIGHT'VE
GOTTEN A LITTLE WORSE.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.472
DID THAT HAPPEN
IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE LEFT?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.040
-NOT IMMEDIATELY.
-YEAH.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.609
YEAH, BUT WHEN I STARTED
COMING IN HERE MORE

05:10.611 --> 05:12.210
WITH THE WORKERS AND STUFF.

05:12.212 --> 05:15.013
I CAN TELL YOU THIS,
THERE'S BEEN SOME BIG PROBLEMS

05:15.015 --> 05:17.682
THAT OCCURRED IN HERE,

05:17.684 --> 05:19.317
FIGHTS, ACCIDENTS.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.553
-LIKE PHYSICAL FIGHTS?
-YEAH.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.754
LIKE, PEOPLE ACTUALLY
FIST FIGHTING IN HERE?

05:22.756 --> 05:23.855
YES.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.357
AFTER A FEW HOURS
THEY'RE IN HERE,

05:25.359 --> 05:29.895
EVERYTHING'S GOING GOOD,
THIS IS THE TAKE I MAKE ON IT.

05:29.897 --> 05:33.431
THEY START TO GET ANGRY,
THEN IT ESCALATES,

05:33.433 --> 05:35.267
THEN THEY'RE
ATTACKING ONE ANOTHER.

05:35.269 --> 05:37.335
I MEAN, THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING UNSETTLING HERE

05:37.337 --> 05:40.772
AND SOMETHING THAT IS VERY
AGGRAVATED ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.240
AND WE FELT THAT ENERGY
WHEN WE WALKED IN HERE --

05:42.242 --> 05:44.910
-OH, YEAH. YEAH, IT WAS --
-...PRIOR TO ALL THIS.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.045
I MEAN, WHEN WE FIRST
CAME IN HERE WE FELT THAT

05:47.047 --> 05:49.247
THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE AND THERE
WAS HIGH, HIGH, TENSION

05:49.249 --> 05:52.049
BETWEEN THE THREE OF US,
ME, ROB, AND NICK,

05:52.051 --> 05:53.384
THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE HERE.

05:53.386 --> 05:54.852
AND WE COULDN'T
EXPLAIN IT EITHER.

05:54.854 --> 05:58.590
YEAH, I STILL TRY
BUT IT MAKES IT...

05:58.592 --> 05:59.924
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
I'D SEEN SOMETHING.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.260
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE
IT'S GETTING CLOSER NOW.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.461
YOU SAW SOMETHING?

06:03.463 --> 06:05.396
YEAH, IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN AT A DISTANCE.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.599
THEN RECENTLY,
IT'S REAL CLOSE.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.401
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHERE I'D SEEN THAT,

06:09.403 --> 06:12.136
WHERE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

06:12.138 --> 06:15.273
I WAS DOING THE TRIM
AND I HAPPENED TO SEE SOMETHING

06:15.275 --> 06:17.475
RIGHT HERE
COMING QUICKLY AT ME,

06:17.477 --> 06:20.011
WHICH CAUSED ME TO KIND OF
FALL BACK INTO THIS ROOM.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.681
WELL, I MEAN, THIS WAS KIND
OF LIKE THE EPICENTER FOR US

06:22.683 --> 06:24.749
WHEN WE WERE HERE,
WAS THIS KITCHEN.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.818
WE HAD THE MUDDY FOOTPRINTS --
-FOOTPRINTS SHOW UP, YEAH.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.253
...REMEMBER AND IN HERE.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.488
YEAH, AND A TRAIL OF WATER, TOO,
THAT WENT ALL THE WAY HERE.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.158
WE ALSO HAD VOICES COMING
THROUGH ON OUR DEVICES

06:33.160 --> 06:35.894
IN THIS KITCHEN THAT WAS
DIRECTING US TO THE BASEMENT.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.296
THE THING THAT GOT ME THE MOST,

06:38.298 --> 06:40.732
WE WERE STANDING OUT THERE
AND WE HAD JUST BEEN IN HERE.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.334
WE COME BACK IN HERE,
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT,

06:43.336 --> 06:45.169
ALL OF THESE CABINETS ARE OPEN.

06:45.171 --> 06:49.073
NO WAY.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.710
AND WHAT WAS SCARY, TOO,
IS LATER ON,

06:51.712 --> 06:53.444
WE FELT THE WHOLE, ENTIRE
BUILDING SHAKE.

06:53.446 --> 06:55.180
-A RUMBLE?
-YEP.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.448
YEAH, OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.316
BEFORE US COMING
OR AFTER US COMING?

06:58.318 --> 07:02.454
BEFORE AND AFTER.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.390
Katrina: THIS IS WHAT FELT LIKE
THE HOT SPOT FOR ME UP HERE.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.926
IT HONESTLY FELT LIKE
MY LIFE WAS IN DANGER.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.862
AND IT WAS LIKE MY HEART
WAS RACING SO, SO FAST

07:10.864 --> 07:12.998
AND THEN IT WAS LIKE
IMMEDIATE REGRET.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.400
SO JUST COMPLETELY
OVERWHELMING FOR ME.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.468
SOMEBODY BACK,
I GUESS IN THE '60s

07:17.470 --> 07:20.105
FORMED A GROUP UP HERE,
AN OCCULT GROUP.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.607
AND THEY REACHED OUT,
ONE OF THEM REACHED OUT TO US.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.076
HE KINDA THINKS
THEY MADE A MISTAKE,

07:25.078 --> 07:27.379
AND DONE SOMETHING
TO THE HOUSE.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.881
Katrina: LAST TIME NICK AND I
CAME TO THE MONROE HOUSE

07:29.883 --> 07:32.083
THERE WAS SOME OCCULT
ARTIFACTS THAT WERE

07:32.085 --> 07:35.153
PURPOSELY BURIED
IN THE CRAWL SPACE.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.488
I CAN'T NAIL DOWN
A SPECIFIC GROUP,

07:37.490 --> 07:41.159
OR A SPECIFIC TRADITION,
BEYOND IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING

07:41.161 --> 07:43.862
INTENDED TO HEX
OR CURSE SOMEBODY.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.764
AND IF THERE IS
A NEGATIVE ENERGY HERE,

07:46.766 --> 07:49.100
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF IT WAS INVITED IN

07:49.102 --> 07:51.536
BY THE PRACTICES THAT WERE DONE.

07:54.441 --> 07:58.176
HELLO, BASEMENT.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.712
SO YOU BOARDED IT UP
LAST TIME WE WERE HERE.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.713
OH, YEAH.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.381
YEAH, YEAH I HAD TO.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.216
I TELL PEOPLE 'CAUSE
I GOT SOME ARTIFACTS,

08:05.218 --> 08:07.519
I DON'T WANT THEM CRAWLING
OVER AND DISTURBING IT.

08:07.521 --> 08:10.722
BUT THE OTHER REASON,
TOO, IS, YOU KNOW,

08:10.724 --> 08:12.390
YOU COULD GET IN
TROUBLE IN THERE.

08:12.392 --> 08:15.227
-SO LAST TIME WE WERE HERE --
-MM-HMM.

08:15.229 --> 08:18.597
...I HAD THIS VERY PROFOUND
EXPERIENCE WHEN I WENT IN THERE.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.133
[ BLEEP ].

08:22.135 --> 08:26.237
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

08:26.239 --> 08:29.507
NOW WHEN WE LEFT THIS LOCATION
WE WERE TELLING YOU

08:29.509 --> 08:31.008
RESEARCH THIS MORE,
SOMETHING IS DOWN HERE.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.043
YOU DID.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.111
YOU CALLED
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.846
POLICE OFFICIAL CAME HERE,
TOOK A REPORT.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.547
MM-HMM.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.650
THIS FIRST OFFICER THAT CAME IN,

08:38.652 --> 08:41.219
THE WAY I THINK THEY VIEWED IT,
THERE'S NO MISSING PERSON,

08:41.221 --> 08:45.556
THERE'S NOT A KNOWN CRIME,
SO HE LET IT GO AT THAT.

08:45.558 --> 08:49.160
BUT WHAT HE SEEN,
HE SAID WAS OLD

08:49.162 --> 08:51.696
AND HE JUST MADE A COMMENT

08:51.698 --> 08:54.099
ABOUT DON'T DO ANYMORE DIGGING,
YOU KNOW,

08:54.101 --> 08:56.100
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.702
WE'RE NOT GONNA GO BACK THERE,
WE'RE NOT GONNA DISTURB

08:57.704 --> 08:59.103
THE BONES OR ANYTHING,
OR TOUCH 'EM,

08:59.105 --> 09:00.438
'CAUSE LEGALLY WE CAN'T.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.106
BUT WE HAVE 72 HOURS
TO INVESTIGATE,

09:02.108 --> 09:04.175
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT
THROUGH OUR MEANS,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.011
THROUGH OUR EQUIPMENT,
AND OUR INVESTIGATION,

09:06.013 --> 09:08.613
TRY TO MAKE CONTACT
WITH WHOEVER THE SPIRIT,

09:08.615 --> 09:10.581
IF IT IS, INDEED,
WE'RE TALKING TO A SPIRIT

09:10.583 --> 09:12.917
OF SOMEONE THAT IS
BURIED BACK THERE

09:12.919 --> 09:15.053
OR IF THERE ARE OTHERS
I DON'T KNOW YET.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.787
AFTER THE LAST TIME
WE WERE HERE

09:16.789 --> 09:18.256
AND WE CALLED THE POLICE,
YOU KNOW,

09:18.258 --> 09:21.493
I THINK WE WERE UNDER
THE IMPRESSION THAT WE WOULD

09:21.495 --> 09:22.661
FINALLY GET SOME ANSWERS.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.997
SOME HARDCORE,
FACTUAL ANSWERS FOR YOU.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.133
AND UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THIS WENT,

09:28.135 --> 09:30.669
SO, YOU KNOW,
NOW IT'S UP TO US TO GO BACK

09:30.671 --> 09:32.070

41:50.742 --> 41:53.409
TO HELP DOCUMENT THIS PROPERTY.

41:53.411 --> 41:55.878
WE HOPE THAT FINDING
ANOTHER BODY ON THE GROUNDS

41:55.880 --> 41:58.748
WILL REOPEN THE INVESTIGATION,
AND GET THE ANSWERS

41:58.750 --> 42:00.783
THESE RESTLESS
SPRITS ARE SEEKING.

42:00.785 --> 42:04.153
AS THE HOMEOWNER, EDDIE HAS TO
GO TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES,

42:04.155 --> 42:05.621
AND HE HAS TO LET
THEM KNOW THAT THERE

42:05.623 --> 42:09.225
ARE MORE SKELETAL REMAINS
ON THIS PROPERTY.

42:09.227 --> 42:10.826
Katrina:
LEAVING THE MONROE HOUSE,

42:10.828 --> 42:14.563
I JUST HOPE THAT OUR WORK THAT
WE'VE DONE HERE CAN FINALLY

42:14.565 --> 42:17.033
PUT THE STORY OF
THE BONES TO REST,

42:17.035 --> 42:22.372
AND MAYBE THIS HOUSE CAN MAYBE
HAVE A LITTLE MORE PEACE TO IT.

42:22.374 --> 42:24.973
Nick: I REALLY BELIEVE THAT
UNTIL THEY TAKE ACTION,

42:24.975 --> 42:27.243
WE FIGURE OUT WHO
THESE BONES BELONG TO,

42:27.245 --> 42:31.881
THEN THE SPIRITS WILL NEVER BE
AT REST AT THE MONROE HOUSE.
