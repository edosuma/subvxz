WEBVTT

00:05.300 --> 00:07.518
Nick! Get the JOC on the horn,

00:07.570 --> 00:09.788
call for extract.

00:09.830 --> 00:11.388
They're massing
on us fast.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.749
We already hit 'em.
It's time to go home.

00:13.790 --> 00:16.702
This is Foxtrot 4,
request for immediate extract.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.263
JOC:
Foxtrot 4, this is JOC.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.878
QRF is inbound.

00:19.930 --> 00:21.921
At your door in 20 seconds.I copy.

00:21.970 --> 00:23.756
20 seconds. Foxtrot 4 out.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.586
Collapse security,
collapse security.

00:25.630 --> 00:27.666
Stand by for breakout.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.755
NICK [over video]:
Go ahead, Swanny,
I got you covered.

00:28.810 --> 00:29.754
BRE'I'I':
No, no, you go.

00:29.810 --> 00:31.107
I got this. Lead us out.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.116
NICK:
Roger that.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.060
All right, boys.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.156
Let's get ready
to make the donuts.

00:37.210 --> 00:38.507
Go, go.

00:48.740 --> 00:50.128
BRE'I'I':
Nick?

00:52.310 --> 00:54.039
Nick?

00:55.440 --> 00:57.351
Nick?

01:01.620 --> 01:03.611
Nick?

01:10.330 --> 01:12.013
Nick?

01:16.070 --> 01:18.026
Nick!

01:18.070 --> 01:19.981
[crying]

01:39.090 --> 01:41.911
[whirring]

01:41.970 --> 01:43.392
Oh...

01:47.490 --> 01:48.832
[groans]

01:55.110 --> 01:57.010
[groans]

02:01.900 --> 02:03.891
[grunts]

02:07.770 --> 02:10.034
[bones crack]

02:10.080 --> 02:11.729
JULIA:
Doesn't sound so good.

02:12.820 --> 02:14.731
[exhales]

02:20.050 --> 02:22.484
I said that didn't
sound very good.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.439
Oh, it's, you know,
it's the ones

02:27.490 --> 02:29.572
that you don't hear
that should scare you, really.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.963
How'd you sleep?

02:32.020 --> 02:35.365
Like a log.

02:35.410 --> 02:37.458
Well...

02:37.500 --> 02:39.627
you know, you didn't
have to sleep out here.

02:39.680 --> 02:43.025
You know therapists, they,
uh, they prefer their patients

02:43.070 --> 02:44.981
on a couch.[laughs softly]

02:47.250 --> 02:49.764
Hey.

02:49.820 --> 02:51.162
Lock up when you leave, okay?

02:59.090 --> 03:00.773
Um, and...

03:02.130 --> 03:04.212
...don't worry about last night.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.438
[exhales]

03:18.850 --> 03:21.148
That seat taken?

03:21.200 --> 03:23.191
[laughs, grunts]
All yours.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.411
Hey.

03:27.110 --> 03:29.931
Well, look at that.
Almost good as new.

03:29.990 --> 03:32.026
Got the bandages off yesterday.Yeah?

03:32.080 --> 03:34.241
You think it'll scar?

03:34.300 --> 03:38.555
Uh, it's hard to say.
Some things do, some don't.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.081
I figured if anyone would know
about scars, it'd be a SEAL.

03:42.130 --> 03:44.439
Ah, well, you know, I
actually got out of that bar

03:44.480 --> 03:46.391
with just a few scratches, so...

03:46.440 --> 03:49.136
Those aren't the wounds
I'm talking about.

03:49.180 --> 03:50.351
Yeah, I know.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.611
You know, the cost of this job,
the collateral damage inside,

03:56.670 --> 03:58.615
it builds up.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.183
And if you don't ﬁnd
a place to put it,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.754
it just sits there,
corroding you.

04:04.940 --> 04:08.671
I denied a man his last rites
to get what I needed from him.

04:10.770 --> 04:13.022
I should pay for it.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.071
I don't understand.

04:18.990 --> 04:22.608
Christine,
what I do for a living--

04:22.650 --> 04:25.426
I traffic in life and death,
and I'm okay with that.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.995
But this was not
about a man's life.

04:29.050 --> 04:31.518
This was about his soul,
and that...

04:31.570 --> 04:33.219
is different.

04:49.150 --> 04:50.936
Hey, Em, I was, uh...

04:50.980 --> 04:52.709
hoping I'd, uh...

04:52.770 --> 04:54.931
get you, but, uh...

04:54.990 --> 04:57.720
[sighs] I wanted
to just wish you good luck

04:57.770 --> 04:59.465
before your recital.

04:59.510 --> 05:01.501
And, um...

05:01.560 --> 05:03.778
you know,
with the whole tuition thing,

05:03.820 --> 05:06.607
I still don't really have
any updates on that, so...

05:06.650 --> 05:09.699
But I'm working on it,
and it's gonna get done.

05:09.740 --> 05:14.302
Do me a favor, will you,
just... give Mike a hug for me.

05:14.350 --> 05:17.911
Tell him to keep his head up
when he plays.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.008
All right, and, uh...

05:22.270 --> 05:24.704
...give your dad a call,
will you?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.239
[sighs heavily]

05:30.760 --> 05:32.580
Long night of fun
with the lady shrink?

05:32.630 --> 05:34.803
[clears throat]
About as long as, uh,

05:34.850 --> 05:36.670
your little breakfast
you just had with, uh,

05:36.720 --> 05:38.676
your new friend--
what's her name?

05:38.720 --> 05:41.336
Christine.Christine.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.462
Yeah, she got clipped
in the Manilla bombing.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.592
Been checking on her,

05:45.640 --> 05:47.642
seeing if she's all right.She got clipped, huh?

05:47.690 --> 05:49.248
Yeah, she got clipped.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.995
So, Ray, let me
ask you something,

05:51.040 --> 05:52.644
what about Naima--

05:52.700 --> 05:54.907
what does she think
about a treatment for her?

05:54.960 --> 05:56.473
She doesn't think anything,
'cause I haven't told her

05:56.530 --> 05:57.861
about it,
'cause there's nothing to say.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.046
If you say so, Ray.

05:59.090 --> 06:00.819
If you say so.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.869
Something you're trying
to ask me, brother?Yeah.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.577
[phones ring]

06:09.630 --> 06:11.052
[sighs]

06:23.680 --> 06:25.898
SONNY:
Anybody know
what the hell's going on?

06:25.950 --> 06:28.418
RAY:
Just better not be another
readiness drill, I know that.

06:28.470 --> 06:30.244
I hate those. They're like
dry strip clubs:

06:30.300 --> 06:31.813
pole's the same,
stage is the same,

06:31.860 --> 06:34.033
but without the booze,
it's like an eighth grade dance.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.604
Sorry, what kind
of eighth grade dances

06:35.650 --> 06:36.730
they have in Texas, Sonny?

06:36.780 --> 06:38.771
Good ones, man.ERIC:
Gentlemen.

06:38.830 --> 06:41.173
Apologies for the
hasty takeoff,

06:41.220 --> 06:43.393
but this_mission is
extremely tIme-senSItIve.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.089
MANDY:
Ten hours ago,

06:45.140 --> 06:48.439
eight members of an Army
Special Forces ODA were ambushed

06:48.490 --> 06:49.878
on the ground in Mali
by fighters

06:49.930 --> 06:51.443
from the Islamic Fighters
of Mali.

06:51.490 --> 06:53.446
IFM.AFRICOM is still
sorting the facts,

06:53.500 --> 06:55.752
but everything
that could go wrong did.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.973
They were hit hard,
engaging in a running gunfight

06:58.020 --> 06:59.749
for a couple klicks
before being ambushed

06:59.810 --> 07:02.449
by a second
Islamic Fighters element here.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.242
The team retreated on foot,
held enemy forces at bay

07:05.290 --> 07:06.939
until their QRF arrived.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.946
If they made it out,
why are we going anywhere?

07:08.990 --> 07:10.719
MANDY:
One of our soldiers
didn't make it back.

07:10.770 --> 07:13.591
In the chaos, Captain
Aaron Washington was cut off

07:13.650 --> 07:15.868
from the team when they
left their vehicles.

07:15.910 --> 07:17.639
Sat footage of the
firefight places him

07:17.690 --> 07:19.294
on the edge
of a ravine

07:19.350 --> 07:21.124
when he was RPG'd.

07:21.170 --> 07:23.479
We still in com_ms contact
WIth Washington?

07:23.530 --> 07:25.998
Captain Washington was KIA.[sighs]

07:29.970 --> 07:31.699
Your job is to
locate and secure

07:31.750 --> 07:33.399
the_ remains of
Captain Washington

07:33.450 --> 07:35.577
before IFM finds him

07:35.620 --> 07:37.963
and turns this into
a propaganda opportunity.

07:38.020 --> 07:41.490
Captain Washington
was a husband, a father.

07:41.540 --> 07:44.452
His family in Idaho
deserves to bury him.

08:12.310 --> 08:14.221
What's going
on there?

08:14.270 --> 08:16.181
You know, the TV's
a lot better when it's on.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.959
[chuckles]
Nice cane.

08:18.010 --> 08:20.228
Leg must be improving.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.702
Don't worry,
I'm still gonna need your help

08:21.760 --> 08:22.795
getting into the shower.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.317
[chuckles]

08:24.370 --> 08:26.326
Check out my new
rehab program.

08:28.370 --> 08:30.930
[liquid boiling]Swann, again with the stove?

08:30.980 --> 08:32.538
Dude, come on, how many times

08:32.590 --> 08:33.932
you gonna leave this thing on
this month, man?

08:38.990 --> 08:40.981
My, um...

08:41.040 --> 08:43.463
my therapist won't commit
to me making it back to Bravo.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.942
You think it's 'cause they're

08:45.000 --> 08:46.729
getting ready
to send me out to pasture?

08:46.780 --> 08:48.338
All the time and money
they're investing

08:48.390 --> 08:50.176
in this rehab plan?

08:50.220 --> 08:53.519
They're counting on you getting
back in the sandbox.

08:53.570 --> 08:54.912
You think so?

08:54.960 --> 08:56.916
Don't roll out
this VIP treatment

08:56.970 --> 09:00.315
for a mothballed frogman
like me.What's wrong,

09:00.360 --> 09:02.316
you wake up on the wrong side
of the bed this morning?I wish.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.703
Too tired to sleep.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.445
You have an appointment
at the VA this morning.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.934
No, VA's tomorrow,
Thursday the 17th.

09:09.980 --> 09:10.969
No, today's Thursday.

09:11.020 --> 09:12.191
What?

09:14.030 --> 09:16.373
Damn it.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.376
Helped hunt down Saddam Hussein.

09:18.420 --> 09:20.331
Now I can't even keep
the days of the week straight.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.776
Come on. Let's go, man.
You bust your ass,

09:24.820 --> 09:25.855
you can still make it.
Let's go.

09:25.910 --> 09:27.684
I don't need a babysitter, man.

09:27.740 --> 09:29.219
I thought BUD/S was supposed
to wean out all the quitters.

09:32.390 --> 09:34.119
Come on.

09:34.180 --> 09:36.819
YODO.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.178
Don't blame me
for rumlng your day, pal.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.619
Did you say "YODO"?
What the hell is that?

09:41.660 --> 09:43.480
So much to learn.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.443
JASON:
What's the latest
on the ground out there?

09:48.500 --> 09:50.013
ERIC:
Damn place is
a kicked hornet's nest.

09:50.060 --> 09:51.402
SIGINT's hitting everywhere,

09:51.460 --> 09:53.018
and IFM fighters
are swarming the area.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.879
If they find Captain Washington,

09:54.940 --> 09:57.192
we'll be watching what
they do next on LiveLeak.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.413
We're not gonna
let that happen.All right.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.325
Two Special Forces ODAs.

10:01.380 --> 10:03.632
We're prepping to
assault the IFM compound

10:03.690 --> 10:05.499
with partner forces.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.425
That should pull most
of the enemy out of the field,

10:07.470 --> 10:08.687
buy us enough time
to recover his body.

10:08.730 --> 10:10.686
Alpha will support Bravo Team.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.514
MARSOC will act as
a blocking force.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.209
You'll have an Air
Force A-1O overhead

10:14.260 --> 10:16.649
for close air support.Three branches for one op?

10:16.700 --> 10:18.918
ERIC:
All_this is to ensure that_
Captain Washington's sacrifice

10:18.960 --> 10:20.439
was not in vain.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.266
Alive or dead,
the United States of America

10:22.310 --> 10:24.039
does not leave a soldier behind.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.442
We'll bring him back.

10:26.840 --> 10:27.738
Damn straight.Let's do it.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.660
Could you have parked
any further?

10:33.720 --> 10:36.325
You bitch this much
at Normandy, Grandpa?

10:36.370 --> 10:38.361
[short chuckle] Nice burn.

10:38.420 --> 10:39.717
How many of your little notes

10:39.760 --> 10:41.671
you have to write down
to remember that one?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.859
Ooh. Oh, that
was hurtful.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.891
And hilarious.
You little bastard.[chuckles]

10:45.940 --> 10:47.896
Looks like you got
the million-dollar

10:47.950 --> 10:49.292
wound there, brother.

10:49.340 --> 10:51.114
Yeah, something like that.

10:51.170 --> 10:52.683
Hey, could you
spare any of those

10:52.730 --> 10:54.334
big dollars for
a hungry vet?

10:54.390 --> 10:55.732
BRETT:
Not now, we're late.

10:57.130 --> 10:59.735
That was cold.

10:59.780 --> 11:01.828
Pay one, you got
to pay them all.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.259
And I know how
much you make.

11:04.310 --> 11:06.301
Little different from
your RaIn Mansunte

11:06.360 --> 11:07.964
at the military hospital.

11:08.010 --> 11:09.921
Yeah, they definitely
leave this

11:09.970 --> 11:11.835
out of_t_hose_
flashy recrUItIng Videos.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.145
This is a soldier's
reward for servmg.

11:15.190 --> 11:17.238
A healthcare system that
runs like the post office.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.236
[phone ringing]

11:19.280 --> 11:20.804
Hello.

11:20.850 --> 11:23.193
Thank you.

11:23.240 --> 11:26.585
I, uh... noticed
you've been watching

11:26.640 --> 11:28.244
some of your old
combat ops.

11:28.290 --> 11:30.850
Yeah. I just like
remembering.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.596
The times, fighting
side-by-side

11:33.640 --> 11:35.426
with my brothers,
loving life.

11:35.470 --> 11:37.381
I get it,
especially now.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.217
Whoa.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.080
We're going nowhere fast.

11:42.130 --> 11:44.212
Hooyah, Senior Chief.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.772
Traumatic brain injury.

26:07.820 --> 26:10.607
Are you sure? The therapist
didn't say anything about it.

26:10.650 --> 26:12.515
'Cause it hasn't been
diagnosed yet.

26:12.570 --> 26:14.788
But I know
it's there.

26:14.830 --> 26:17.003
I can't say how,
exactly,

26:17.050 --> 26:19.086
but I got...
I got rocked

26:19.140 --> 26:20.914
by a couple of IED blasts,

26:20.970 --> 26:22.915
including the one
that killed Nicky.

26:22.970 --> 26:25.359
Why'd you hide this from me?

26:25.400 --> 26:27.311
[scoffs softly]

26:29.410 --> 26:31.059
I was embarrassed,
I guess.

26:32.850 --> 26:34.533
Plus, I didn't
want to scare you.

26:34.590 --> 26:37.809
How many times you had
your bell rung, huh?

26:41.030 --> 26:43.339
I wouldn't change my time
in the teams for anything.

26:43.380 --> 26:45.245
Even knowing this.

26:47.380 --> 26:49.075
War is bad for
the brain, man.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.338
Emotional trauma.

26:51.390 --> 26:53.688
There's, like,
a fire in my head.

26:53.740 --> 26:56.300
Having a TBI is like...

26:56.350 --> 26:58.432
throwing rocket fuel onto it.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.209
Kaboom.

27:00.270 --> 27:01.999
It's a destructive combination.

27:04.180 --> 27:05.875
It's a lot to carry
around on your own.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.388
Says the guy who
shut himself off from the world

27:08.450 --> 27:10.406
when he got blown up.

27:14.370 --> 27:16.019
Became SEALs
'cause we...

27:16.060 --> 27:18.199
'cause we didn't know how
to ring the bell, right?

27:20.590 --> 27:23.673
Only thing a frogman doesn't
know how to do is ask for help.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.416
[chuckles]

27:26.470 --> 27:30.167
All the time I spent
downrange...

27:30.210 --> 27:31.984
the enemy never scared me.

27:35.470 --> 27:37.426
But the enemy's in my head now.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.380
And I'm terrified, Clay.

your contact in the ravine

28:13.510 --> 28:15.068

You have roughly
three dozen enemy fighters

28:27.440 --> 28:29.396
It's getting late.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.783
Whole day's a waste
if I don't see the doctor.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.489
You're gonna get in.
Don't worry.

28:33.530 --> 28:35.225
So, what's the play?

28:35.270 --> 28:37.272
I know you're not showing up
without a plan of action.

28:37.320 --> 28:39.015
Three-pronged attack.

28:39.060 --> 28:41.881
Get Dr. Wilson to diagnose the
TBI, plot a course of treatment,

28:41.930 --> 28:43.488
then pray like hell
something works

treatment ideas in that binder.

Always a SEAL. Even
with a busted brain,

28:51.510 --> 28:53.808
I still feel like I know
better than everyone else.

All right, I'm coming with you.

Where was this earlier?

29:00.340 --> 29:01.591
Could've saved me
the humiliation

29:01.650 --> 29:03.550
of having to ask you.

29:03.610 --> 29:05.510
Dr. Wilson's
running behind.

We have to
reschedule.

Well, I've-I've been
waiting all day.

29:09.130 --> 29:10.950

29:11.010 --> 29:13.524
That's two months
from now.Please.

that I see Dr. Wilson today.

my buddy Brett--

29:33.290 --> 29:35.508
he's... he's a little _
embarrassed to say, but he is...

29:35.550 --> 29:36.983
He just come back
from the Amazon,

29:37.030 --> 29:38.338
and he's got
a really gnarly rash.

29:38.380 --> 29:39.278
What are you doing?Rash?

29:39.340 --> 29:40.420
Yeah.

29:40.470 --> 29:42.119
Right, Brett?

29:42.170 --> 29:43.296
Go on.Yeah, yeah.

29:43.340 --> 29:44.819
I-I can't lie to you, sir.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.599

it's-it's pretty gross.

Look, I think
that Dr. Wilson really

29:51.830 --> 29:53.604
should take a look
at this thing.

Yeah, my neck's
manageable, but I, uh...

31:10.780 --> 31:13.863
I came here to talk
about my real issue: TBI.

31:13.910 --> 31:15.775
I didn't see any record
of traumatic brain injury.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.161
CLAY:
Well, that's because it hasn't

31:17.220 --> 31:18.175
been diagnosed yet.

31:18.220 --> 31:19.255
My psychological issues

31:19.310 --> 31:20.607
are consistent with TBI.

31:20.660 --> 31:22.696
I have the, uh,
physical manifestations:

31:22.750 --> 31:24.263
headaches, dizziness,
ringing in my ears,

31:24.310 --> 31:25.789
insomnia, shaking hands.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.092
Uh, how do you know
this was combat related?

31:28.140 --> 31:29.960
Brett ran thousands
of spec ops.

31:30.010 --> 31:31.568
You know,
tip of the spear gets exposed.

31:31.620 --> 31:34.748
My bet is I suffered
blast-induced neurotrauma.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.449
Hmm.What do you think?

31:36.500 --> 31:38.798
Well, I'd have to run a battery
of tests before diagnosing,

31:38.850 --> 31:42.104
but your mental health issues
and cognitive impairments,

31:42.160 --> 31:45.414
physical ailments
and record of heavy combat

31:45.460 --> 31:46.506
certainly support the claim.

31:46.550 --> 31:48.632
I could kiss you, Doc.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.159
Anyone ever thank you

31:50.210 --> 31:52.166
for telling them
that their brain is screwed?

31:52.210 --> 31:54.599
Now, slow down, Brett.I know you have
a process to follow,

31:54.650 --> 31:56.254
and I'll pass those tests
with flying colors.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.905

an aggressive treatment program.

would you recommend?

32:16.930 --> 32:17.919
I can't recommend any of them.

you prescribe.

which is why I'm here.

and-and treated.

while you were serving...

32:41.080 --> 32:42.684

What do you mean, documented?

understand it?

more concerned about...

32:58.620 --> 32:59.962
about reporting my headache

than-than trying
to save his life?

to serving our country.

You're gonna hang him out to dry
over some clerical issue?

33:07.810 --> 33:09.971
Well, it's...
I empathize with you,

33:10.030 --> 33:12.157
but I'm not doing anything.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.804
It's not about me.
It's about the system.

Please.

Then I can find
someone willing to help me.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.085
I can't authori...

33:27.130 --> 33:30.861
I don't have the authority
to authorize an MRI,

33:30.920 --> 33:32.649

thousands of dollars.

Why you doing this to me?

33:43.930 --> 33:46.103
I'm not doing anything
to you, Brett.

33:46.150 --> 33:48.402

but my hands are tied.

treat your symptoms.Symptoms.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.509
Treat the symptom.

Not the problem.

down for the fight,

36:50.730 --> 36:51.799
'cause it's gonna be a fight.

36:51.860 --> 36:53.896

Come on, man, you
can't think like that.

37:03.830 --> 37:05.821
You know, when I got out,
I was determined

37:05.870 --> 37:07.383
to live a life full
of purpose and meaning.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.123
I figured that'd be the best way

37:09.180 --> 37:10.784
to honor those
who didn't come home.

37:10.830 --> 37:13.003
But now all I want is to...

37:13.050 --> 37:14.915
is to sleep through the night
without nightmares,

37:14.970 --> 37:16.619
wake up feeling normal again.

37:16.660 --> 37:19.663
I don't think
that's too much to ask, right?

37:19.710 --> 37:22.019
Look, all the battles
you fought, dude?

37:22.060 --> 37:24.278

this licked in no time.
