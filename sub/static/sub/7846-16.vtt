-Eeee!

00:10.052 --> 00:11.484
Scrooge just got
a new security bot,

00:11.519 --> 00:12.919
and it can melt
through solid steel,

00:12.954 --> 00:13.953

Aah! Unh!

-Um, your brothers?

Webby,
I don't have brothers.

I'm an only child.

Don't be ridicu.
[gasps] Oh, no.

00:25.162 --> 00:27.595
We must be in some sort of

Calm down.
Everything is fine.

Yaah!

00:34.535 --> 00:38.637
Give it up, Dew-pelganger!
Where... is... Dewey!

00:38.672 --> 00:41.272
Webby, stop! That is Dewey!

He's just doing
a Dewey thing!

Oh.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.609
Thank you,
good Samaritans.

00:46.644 --> 00:50.713
You restored my faith
in the kindness
of random strangers.

00:50.748 --> 00:54.215
Not even one hour in,
and your stupid "Only Child Day"

one of us killed.

I can finally make friends
with Doofus Drake,

01:33.043 --> 01:35.177
the richest kid
in Duckburg.

01:35.212 --> 01:38.713
He only mingles with other
obscenely rich heirs, so...

-What a snob.
-He's the worst.

01:41.383 --> 01:42.715
You see the judgement

01:42.750 --> 01:44.851
Well, today
your heartless criticism

01:44.886 --> 01:47.352
can't deny me my dream
of being shamelessly spoiled.

01:47.387 --> 01:48.887
What are
you gonna do, Dewey?

01:48.922 --> 01:50.488
I don't have to
explain myself to you!

01:50.523 --> 01:52.889
I'm an only child!

01:52.924 --> 01:54.657
I don't get
why you're doing this.

Isn't being
a triplet awesome?

The brother you rudely take
for granted! Right, Louie?

This random passerby clearly
loves Only Child Day,
right, Louie?

02:06.534 --> 02:08.667
Or whoever you are?

I have that for myself?!

expect us

I figured it was high time
that we rubbed elbows and...

10:20.282 --> 10:25.917
Geeeee-aaaaaaah!

10:25.952 --> 10:27.319
Brain freeze.

10:32.991 --> 10:34.124
Friend present.

10:36.593 --> 10:39.027
Oh... for me?

10:39.062 --> 10:40.895
I like to play
with my friends.

10:45.167 --> 10:48.167
All right, friend.
[chuckles] Let's play!

10:50.069 --> 10:53.003

11:19.024 --> 11:20.990
Aaah!

11:23.093 --> 11:26.361
You seem stressed.
Come with me!

11:31.532 --> 11:32.599
[gasps]

11:35.335 --> 11:38.135
This is where I come
to blow off steam.

11:38.170 --> 11:41.137
Is that an original
Stradabearius violin?

11:41.172 --> 11:44.974
That's worth more than
every house Uncle Donald
has ever owned!

11:47.010 --> 11:48.509
Are you nuts?

11:48.544 --> 11:50.610
Aren't you afraid
you'll get in trouble?

11:50.645 --> 11:51.678
Meh!

11:51.713 --> 11:53.313
Of course.

11:53.348 --> 11:57.348
Real wealth is not caring
if people think you're crazy.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.951
Because they
can't stop you anyway!

Uh... uh... what?

12:19.700 --> 12:21.165
[both] Geememama.

12:21.200 --> 12:25.035
Geememama Francis,
my dear deceased Grandma,

12:25.070 --> 12:27.838
who left me
her entire fortune.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.439
No one touches her portrait,
no one!

12:30.474 --> 12:33.274
I let you eat wall cotton,
you impudent brat!

12:33.309 --> 12:35.342
Are you smiling, servants?

12:35.377 --> 12:37.277
Is this funny to you?!

-[objects breaking]
-So... you're his butler, huh?

12:43.850 --> 12:46.016
My butler's a ghost.

12:46.051 --> 12:47.451
Yup. Yeah, he's dead.

12:47.486 --> 12:48.985
We're dead inside.

12:49.020 --> 12:50.954
We're Doofus' parents.

12:50.989 --> 12:52.020
Sorry, what?

12:52.055 --> 12:54.189
He used to be
such a sweet boy,

12:54.224 --> 12:56.658
but the money
and power changed him.

12:58.227 --> 13:00.327
Aaaah!

13:00.362 --> 13:03.062
[panting]

Go.
Before it's too late.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.235
What's next,
friendy-friend?

13:11.270 --> 13:14.637
You know, I just noticed
it's getting a little late,

13:14.672 --> 13:16.471
and, uh, so
I'm just gonna head home,

13:16.506 --> 13:18.240
fondly remember
all the good times we had.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.074
Cool? All right, bye.

You <i> are</i> home,

13:27.447 --> 13:31.916
Help! Guys!
I don't want to
be an only child anymore!

13:31.951 --> 13:33.650
The sooner you give up,
the better.

13:33.685 --> 13:35.518
Hope only makes it worse.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.319
No! If the three
of us work together,

13:37.354 --> 13:39.387
we might just be able
to get out of here.

13:39.422 --> 13:41.056
Are you with me?

13:46.961 --> 13:48.227
The new one's a traitor.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.028
But I stopped him
out of loyalty.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.263
Because I love you,
Doofus.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.731
You're pathetic.

13:52.766 --> 13:54.665
No! He's lying.
I would never do that.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.699
I'm your friend... present.

13:56.734 --> 13:58.067
Ew, gross.

13:58.102 --> 14:01.169
I don't think I like you
anymore, new friend.

14:01.204 --> 14:04.705
Maybe you need
a lesson in friendship.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.573
Wait. What's that for?

14:08.710 --> 14:11.110
What is he going to do
with the umbrella and walnuts?

14:13.246 --> 14:14.279
[groaning]

14:15.281 --> 14:16.281
Louie!

Ooh, new new friends.

Whoops. Sorry, security-bot.

14:32.293 --> 14:33.926
Just innocent kid stuff.

It's all about Dewey now.

15:32.168 --> 15:34.002
[bass plays]

15:34.037 --> 15:37.872
So the big question is,
what "Dewey" do?

What "Dewey" do?

15:42.175 --> 15:43.675

15:43.710 --> 15:45.776
Woof. Audience is
a little stiff tonight.

15:45.811 --> 15:46.777
Am I right, Dewey?

15:46.812 --> 15:48.578
A-ha!

15:48.613 --> 15:50.613
Ha ha, that joke crashed
so hard,

Cool cool cool cool.

16:05.326 --> 16:07.425
This is, of course,
a sample episode

16:07.460 --> 16:09.293
of our totally amazing show.

16:09.328 --> 16:12.195
So if you're a TV producer
looking for a hit so fresh,

16:12.230 --> 16:14.797
so unique, and so top secret

16:14.832 --> 16:16.465
even my brothers
can't know about it,

16:16.500 --> 16:18.166
this is the show for you.

16:18.201 --> 16:20.267
So my first guest is...

16:20.302 --> 16:24.170
I'm very excited
for my first gue-- uh...

16:24.205 --> 16:26.772
Maybe shoulda thought about this
before I kicked everyone out.

16:26.807 --> 16:28.307
Oh!

16:29.675 --> 16:32.010
Please give
a warm round of a applause

Let me check the Junior
Woodchuck Guidebook.

Hello, Dewey.
Thanks for having me.

16:46.854 --> 16:48.654
Hey, buddy,
good to have you.

16:48.689 --> 16:51.323
So how are you enjoying
Only Child Day?

16:51.358 --> 16:53.024
[robotic voice]
I fear it deeply.

16:53.059 --> 16:54.992
Being a triplet
is a way of life.

16:55.027 --> 16:58.194
Things are better in threes.
Threes. Threes.

16:58.229 --> 17:00.162
Weird. Super weird.

17:00.197 --> 17:02.164
Okay. I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.

17:02.199 --> 17:03.631
Here we goooo!
What's your name?

17:03.666 --> 17:05.133

Do you love calendars?

17:06.435 --> 17:07.867

17:18.911 --> 17:21.344
[gasps] Aah!

17:21.378 --> 17:24.079

Robo-Huey is on a rampage!

17:26.450 --> 17:28.148

Speaking of, my next guest...
um, my next...

17:30.685 --> 17:32.252
Uh...

17:34.688 --> 17:37.221
Louie in the house!
Oh, boy!

Huey, you
got a plan, right?

18:18.552 --> 18:20.352
[robotic voice]
Sorry, I'm technically you,

18:20.387 --> 18:22.754
and since you don't
have a plan, neither do I.

18:22.789 --> 18:24.688
Hey, I don't need you!
I'm self-sufficient!

18:24.723 --> 18:26.290

19:00.449 --> 19:02.148
Oh, I just jammed it open

21:07.572 --> 21:09.505
-Whoo-hoo!
-You guys!

21:09.540 --> 21:11.506
Wait, are you
brothers again,

21:11.541 --> 21:14.509
or did this
whole thing happen
in another dimension

21:14.543 --> 21:17.377
and you're all
evil doppelgangers!

21:17.412 --> 21:18.578
[all] No, no, no,
definitely brothers!

21:18.613 --> 21:20.012
Or whatever makes you
not hurt me!

21:20.047 --> 21:22.013
So you're
not gonna break up?

21:22.048 --> 21:23.848
Of course not.
We never were.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.382
We need each other.

21:25.417 --> 21:26.850
Yeah, I love
being a triplet.

21:26.885 --> 21:28.418
But we still have to be
our own people.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.053
Well, I guess Only Child Day

21:30.088 --> 21:32.388
wasn't an absolute
disaster after all.

21:34.424 --> 21:36.991
Uh, sibling calendar?!

21:37.026 --> 21:38.558
I'm a hundred percent sure

21:38.593 --> 21:39.593
I'm going to regret this,
but fine.

21:39.628 --> 21:41.428
All right, Louie!
We did it!

21:41.463 --> 21:43.395
Pretty sure Louie
was with me on this.

21:43.430 --> 21:45.396
I still have two more hours
of Only Child Day.

21:45.431 --> 21:46.764
You guys figure it out.

21:46.799 --> 21:49.333
Good point.
Au revoir, strangers.

21:49.368 --> 21:52.235
So, uh, how much
did you see, you know,

21:52.270 --> 21:53.569
when you came into my room?

21:53.604 --> 21:56.605
-Oh. Nothing.
-Good.
