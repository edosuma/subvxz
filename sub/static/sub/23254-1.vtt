15:37.720 --> 15:41.440
<i> I think being angry and sad</i>
<i>at the same time really turns me on.</i>

15:49.880 --> 15:50.880
Come here.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.680
<i> I think I could fall</i>
<i>in love with him.</i>

15:59.560 --> 16:00.480
<i>Also...</i>

16:00.800 --> 16:01.920
<i>he has a car.</i>

16:04.040 --> 16:07.520
<i> I wondered if it'd be easier</i>
<i>to slit her throat if I flipped her round.</i>

16:07.600 --> 16:09.800
<i>Whether it would be better</i>
<i>not to see her face,</i>

16:09.880 --> 16:11.280
<i>but then, the angle.</i>

16:11.960 --> 16:13.560
<i>It was a conundrum.</i>

16:15.320 --> 16:17.560
-Let's get out of here.

16:18.880 --> 16:19.840
-I'm serious.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.200
Let's leave this shithole town. Now.

16:22.880 --> 16:25.840
You hate it. I hate it.
Our parents are dickheads.

16:25.920 --> 16:26.880
You've got a car.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.160
-It's my dad's.
-Who's a dickhead.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.000
I'm going, whether you come with me
or not. Are you in?

16:33.080 --> 16:34.280
<i> Please say yes.</i>

16:36.440 --> 16:37.720
<i> I figured...</i>

16:37.920 --> 16:39.040
<i>I wasn't in a rush.</i>
