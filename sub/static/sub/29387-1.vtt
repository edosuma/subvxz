No!

Please, somebody help me!

02:35.156 --> 02:36.488
- Jude!

02:36.490 --> 02:38.423
Are you all right?

02:38.425 --> 02:39.825
- Yes, Professor.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.828
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.663
My E-string broke.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.232
- Yes. Indeed.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.902
<i>Can we have the lights, please?</i>

02:58.546 --> 03:00.512
(ominous music)

03:03.617 --> 03:05.450
- I don't know.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.419
Maybe I'm just

03:07.421 --> 03:09.188
cracking up.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.323
(somber music)

03:17.431 --> 03:19.898
<i> - Yes, Emily Foster.</i>

03:19.900 --> 03:21.600
<i> No one could touch her.</i>

03:21.602 --> 03:23.468
<i> I was amazed.</i>

03:23.470 --> 03:24.870
<i> Even a bit jealous of her.</i>

03:24.872 --> 03:27.306
<i> But she was the only</i>
       <i> one of my students</i>

03:27.308 --> 03:29.975
to ever win the
         FAC Fellowship.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.347
Next day she was gone.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.952
- Do you think I'm ready?

03:43.724 --> 03:45.257
- Jude,

03:45.259 --> 03:46.692
you...

03:46.694 --> 03:47.960
you know I...

03:48.896 --> 03:51.863
I think you are
         very talented.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.799
Just like Emily.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.667
But...

03:57.738 --> 03:58.870
Well...

03:59.773 --> 04:01.640
What do you
         want me to say?

04:02.643 --> 04:05.744
The FAC tryouts
       are not like here.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.446
We're all

04:07.448 --> 04:08.614
friends.

04:10.317 --> 04:13.552
You would be in a
        huge auditorium.

04:13.554 --> 04:18.023
A cold empty stage. Bright
      lights in your eyes.

04:18.024 --> 04:22.861
It's all designed to make
      you feel threatened,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.630
intimidated.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.599
(ominous music)

04:27.601 --> 04:31.536
Of the 200 people
         that audition,

04:31.538 --> 04:33.739
sometimes only
          two qualify.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.676
- Professor,
         I'm gonna work

04:37.678 --> 04:39.745
just so much harder than
   any other student you have.

04:39.747 --> 04:40.779
- Jude.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.384
(sighing)

04:47.454 --> 04:48.820
Jude,

04:49.757 --> 04:52.758
do you remember
        what I told you?

04:53.694 --> 04:54.493
- Yeah.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.095
- Mm-hm?

04:56.096 --> 04:57.696
- The tension between
        order and chaos.

04:57.698 --> 04:58.997
Precision and passion.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.899
- Yes, precision
          is essential.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.635
The two together will guide
      you to what you seek.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.903
Precision by
         itself is cold.

05:04.905 --> 05:05.937
It has no feeling.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.673
Passion by itself is...

05:07.675 --> 05:09.441
chaos.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.913
Emily understood.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.383
She achieved the two.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.787
At a terrible cost.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.390
(ominous music)

05:27.928 --> 05:30.562
<i> - [Ben] So which one</i>
    <i> are you supposed to be?</i>

05:30.564 --> 05:32.664
<i> The soulless one or the...</i>

05:32.666 --> 05:33.865
<i> what's the other one?</i>

05:33.867 --> 05:35.334
- Chaotic.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.636
I don't know, both.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.638
Because then I'm gifted.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.972
I don't know.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.508
I think he just wants
      to mess with my head

05:43.510 --> 05:45.777
or get into my pants.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.912
Or both.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.198
- Well,

05:49.199 --> 05:51.483
if we're talking about
    getting into your pants,

05:51.485 --> 05:54.119
<i> I, for one, would very</i>
     <i> much like to do that.</i>

05:54.121 --> 05:55.020
<i> - [Jude] Really?</i>

05:55.022 --> 05:56.455
<i> - [Ben] Yes, yeah.</i>

05:56.457 --> 05:57.522
(laughing)

05:57.524 --> 05:58.490
- Okay, later.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.025
- Is that Ben? Hi, Ben.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.026
Jude's sleeping around.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.527
She had sex with
           Mr. Murphy.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.962
<i> - [Jude] Ah, no.</i>

06:03.964 --> 06:05.664
- Jude doesn't
         treat you right

06:05.666 --> 06:07.666
you know I'm available, okay?

06:07.668 --> 06:10.635
- I can mistreat Ben
     all I want, thank you.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.903
- [Sarah] Uh-huh.
  - [Jude] Okay, I'm gonna go.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.805
- [Ben] Okay.
 - [Jude] All right, I love you.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.441
- [Ben] Love you too.
 - [Sarah] I love you too, Ben.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.976
Call me.
           (laughing)

06:17.978 --> 06:20.045
- All right. Love you,
         Jude and Sarah.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.613
<i> And hi, Veronica.</i>

06:21.615 --> 06:22.447
<i> - [Jude] Okay, I'll</i>
       <i> talk to you later.</i>

06:22.449 --> 06:23.782
- Hey, Ben!

06:23.784 --> 06:24.950
- Okay, bye. Muah.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.653
- What's up?

06:28.655 --> 06:29.654
- Hey, what's up?

06:29.656 --> 06:30.722
<i> - My ladies.</i>

06:31.392 --> 06:32.491
- Hey.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.692
- [Sarah] Hey.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.928
- Great news, my babies.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.131
I have finally sublet
       that upstairs room.

06:39.133 --> 06:40.766
- No way, that's great.

06:40.768 --> 06:44.002
- Yeah? What's he like?
        Better than you?

06:44.004 --> 06:46.738
- Stop, Sarah. We both
     know that's impossible.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.574
- I just hope he's not
    crazy like that last guy.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.159
- Yeah.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.743
- Oh my God, that dude sucked.
       - (Sarah laughing)

06:52.746 --> 06:54.146
Fucking nightmare.

06:54.148 --> 06:56.581
Yeah, this dude's
      pretty cool, though.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.049
He plays the guitar.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.885
- Oh, that's so boring.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.053
We want someone
     interesting and exotic.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.122
- I want uncircumcised.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.724
<i> - [Jude] Sarah.</i>

07:07.561 --> 07:08.660
- He's British.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.562
That's all I really know.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.830
Oh,

homeboy thinks
        he knows movies.

<i> - [Steve] We'll</i>
        <i> see about that.</i>

07:15.169 --> 07:17.102
<i> - [Veronica] Bon app√©tit.</i>

07:17.104 --> 07:18.837
- Ah, fava beans
       and a good Chianti?

07:18.839 --> 07:21.440
- Okay, no Hannibal.

07:21.442 --> 07:22.174
Ravioli.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.076
- Hey, Steve's new
      roommate is British.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.111
- British?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.646
- Does he go to
        the Conservatory?

07:27.648 --> 07:28.613
<i> - [Steve] I didn't check.</i>

07:28.615 --> 07:31.483
Hey, my beautiful mamacitas,

07:32.219 --> 07:33.969
<i> how long do I</i>
        <i> have to sit here</i>

07:33.970 --> 07:35.720
<i> before you offer me</i>
       <i> some of this food?</i>

07:35.722 --> 07:38.723
- What do you bring
      to the party, Steve?

07:38.725 --> 07:42.093
- You mean besides this
  perfect personality and hair?

07:42.095 --> 07:44.496
- [Veronica] Yeah, besides
  the personality and the hair,

07:44.498 --> 07:46.064
what do you bring?

07:46.066 --> 07:47.599
- Weed.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.934
- Oh.
       - [Veronica] Right.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.001
- Go get a plate.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.103
(laughing)

07:56.009 --> 07:58.176
(photo snapping)

07:58.178 --> 08:00.111
- [Ben] Okay, um...

08:01.648 --> 08:02.948
I want you.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.083
I'm feeling your breasts.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.253
I want to be
         inside of you.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.120
- [Jude] Ben!

08:09.122 --> 08:10.188
(Jude laughing)

08:10.190 --> 08:11.790
- [Ben] What? What?

08:11.792 --> 08:14.059
- You can't just
        start at the end.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.228
You have to ease into
     it with some foreplay.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.830
- Oh, okay.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.866
- Yeah, I want to do it.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.133
<i> - [Ben] You want to...</i>
            <i> - Mm-hm.</i>

08:22.135 --> 08:24.769
- Okay, you wanna do it?
            - Mm-hm.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.539
Are you touching yourself?

08:29.109 --> 08:31.042
- Yeah.
             - Good.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.047
So I'm touching you

08:36.817 --> 08:38.216
and kissing you.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.986
- Where are you kissing me?

08:40.988 --> 08:43.722
- Mmm, your neck.

08:44.258 --> 08:45.824
<i> - [Ben] Cool.</i>

08:45.826 --> 08:48.560
- And I'm running my
     fingers down your body.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.297
Kissing your chest.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.032
- What else?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.200
- I miss you.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.868
- I miss you too.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.070
This feels really
        nice. Keep going.

08:59.072 --> 08:59.938
(giggling)

08:59.940 --> 09:01.706
- I'm moving down.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.277
Touching you.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.913
Feeling you. Feeling
        how hard you are.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.848
- Very, very hard.

09:11.852 --> 09:15.120
- And I move
         my lips lower.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.255
- Yeah?
          - And lower.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.290
- How low?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.995
- And then I finally
       move my lips just--

09:23.997 --> 09:26.164
(ominous music)

09:26.166 --> 09:27.699
Shit!

09:27.701 --> 09:28.700
- Keep going.

09:28.702 --> 09:29.634
- Shit!

09:29.636 --> 09:31.002
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

09:31.004 --> 09:32.237

         <i> - [Jude] Shit!</i>

09:32.239 --> 09:34.239

09:35.175 --> 09:36.808
<i> Hello?</i>

09:37.811 --> 09:39.144
<i> Hello?</i>

09:39.146 --> 09:41.079
<i> Did I lose you?</i>

09:41.081 --> 09:42.280
<i> Hello?</i>

09:42.282 --> 09:44.716
- I'll call you back
     in a little bit, okay?

09:44.718 --> 09:46.618
<i> - [Ben] Is everything okay?</i>

09:46.620 --> 09:48.053
<i> What happened?</i>

09:49.089 --> 09:50.255

(ominous music)

10:31.765 --> 10:34.799

10:47.314 --> 10:49.147

10:50.751 --> 10:52.217
<i> Right?</i>

10:52.219 --> 10:53.785
<i> Okay, again.</i>

10:53.787 --> 10:55.854
From the top.
        First variation.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.671
<i> I'll give you the money.</i>

11:46.672 --> 11:48.205
<i> - [Tommy] When? I</i>
      <i> want it fucking now!</i>

11:48.208 --> 11:50.108

12:02.255 --> 12:05.223
- That crazy bitch
         broke my nose!

12:05.225 --> 12:07.158
(tires screeching)

12:08.161 --> 12:10.395
(ominous music)

12:16.036 --> 12:18.369
- What was that about?

12:18.371 --> 12:19.621
- Nothing.

12:19.622 --> 12:20.872
- Are you gonna
        call the police?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.073
- No, I'm not gonna
        call the police.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.241
- Why?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.944
- Because, Jude,
       you know what I do.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.345
Okay, that guy's
          an investor.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.047
So he fronts me.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.815
And I was short this week so

12:30.817 --> 12:33.351
we had a failure
         to communicate.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.386
And then I called
         his mom a cunt.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.924
- What? I would've hit you too.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.327
- That's me. The guy people hit.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.130
How was rehearsal?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.264
- It was great.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.766
It was good.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.135
- Cool.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.805
- Hey, you remember Emily
 Foster, from the Conservatory,

12:53.807 --> 12:55.457
right?

12:55.458 --> 12:57.108
- Yeah, the girl who was
      pushed off the roof.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.211
- No, I heard she
       committed suicide.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.980
- I don't know.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.348
Someone told me
         she was pushed.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.650
Why?

13:05.651 --> 13:07.951
- They said she was so
    good that she went crazy.

13:07.954 --> 13:08.419
I don't know.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.559
- Jude,
       if you ever need...

13:17.030 --> 13:19.063
If you ever need anything.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.265
Like...

13:25.205 --> 13:26.304
- Thanks.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.042
- Speaking of
        your girl, Emily,

13:31.044 --> 13:33.178
I heard they never
        found her violin.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.480
Aren't those like a
    hundred thousand dollars?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.115
- Yeah, some are.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.316
Mine isn't.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.491
(upbeat music)

13:49.095 --> 13:50.595
<i> - [Steve] I'm moving</i>
      <i> all over the place.</i>

13:50.597 --> 13:52.931
<i> I fought like Jiu Jitsu,</i>
   <i> and I'm defending myself.</i>

13:52.933 --> 13:54.599
<i> He's trying to</i>
         <i> stomp me out.</i>

13:54.601 --> 13:56.985
<i> And all of a sudden I hear</i>

13:56.986 --> 13:59.370
<i> these tiny, little footsteps</i>
     <i> sprinting towards me.</i>

13:59.372 --> 14:02.140
<i> And she woof, woof,</i>
    <i> just starts going crazy.</i>

14:02.142 --> 14:04.442
He's like, spinning
           backwards.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.977
- Jude?

14:05.979 --> 14:06.978
Jude?

14:06.980 --> 14:08.613
<i> Earth to Jude.</i>

14:08.615 --> 14:10.048
<i> Come here.</i>

14:10.417 --> 14:12.050
<i> Come here.</i>

14:12.052 --> 14:13.218
- Hey, guys.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.152
- Hey.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.088
(Steve groaning)

14:17.090 --> 14:19.157
- Whoa, is that
      dinner on your face?

14:19.159 --> 14:20.191
Come on, get up.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.626
- He's thawing
        them out for us.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.162
- At least it's not
       dinner on his dick.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.330
(laughing)

14:25.332 --> 14:27.232
- Hey, I ordered pizza.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.434
- Oh, thank you. Long day.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.503
- [Steve] What is this?

14:34.307 --> 14:36.140
"A center for ants?"

14:36.142 --> 14:36.608
- What?

14:36.610 --> 14:39.428
- [Steve] Zoolander.
      - [Sarah] Zoolander.

14:39.429 --> 14:42.247
- Oh, whatever. Anyways, guys,
  this is months in the making.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.414
Look at it.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.250
- Whoa.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.651
- Look at the detail.

14:46.653 --> 14:47.652
- Yeah.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.654
- So what happened to you?

14:49.656 --> 14:53.258
- Oh, Jude saved Steve
   from a drug deal gone bad.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.559
<i> - [Steve] Well,</i>
       <i> it wasn't a drug--</i>

14:54.561 --> 14:55.393
<i> - [Sarah] Whatever.</i>

14:55.395 --> 14:57.629
<i> Jude kicked ass.</i>

14:57.630 --> 14:59.864
<i> - [Veronica] Steve,</i>
     <i> where's the roommate?</i>

14:59.865 --> 15:02.099
- Oh, you know, busy
    eating crumpets and shit.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.568
Can't come over.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.937
- Did you invite him?

15:05.939 --> 15:06.671
- No.

15:07.474 --> 15:08.823
- Wow.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.173
- I'm keeping all
        of you to myself.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.509
- Ew.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.679
- Keep yourself
          to yourself.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.081
Steve, what are you doing?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.583
- What are you doing?
        Are you serious?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.085
- I said months in
      the making, come on.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.586
- You threw peas
        at me right now?

15:21.587 --> 15:23.087
- I just told you I've
   been working hard on this.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.123
- Come on, man. You guys
   are supposed be my friends.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.457
Yo, I'm out of here. I need
   to water my plants anyway.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.326
- You are so annoying.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.261
- Wow, cool.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.562
Some friends.
          Thanks, guys.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.430
(laughing)

15:32.432 --> 15:33.548
- [Sarah] Bye.

15:33.549 --> 15:34.665
<i> - [Veronica] He</i>
      <i> literally broke it.</i>

15:34.668 --> 15:36.668
He broke it, look.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.303
- Oh, fuck.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.604
- So annoying.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.172
- Bye.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.106
<i> - [Veronica] Oh.</i>

15:43.243 --> 15:44.642
Anyways, um,

15:44.644 --> 15:47.278
what really happened today?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.080
- It was nothing.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.982
<i> - [Veronica] Nothing? Okay.</i>

15:50.984 --> 15:53.318
- I got a little wound
       up after rehearsal.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.620
- Must've been
       wound pretty tight.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.655
(laughing)

15:57.657 --> 15:59.424
- Do you guys remember
          Emily Foster?

15:59.426 --> 16:01.359
<i> - [Sarah] Yeah.</i>

16:01.361 --> 16:03.261
The crazy violinist who
      jumped off the roof?

16:03.263 --> 16:05.096
<i> - [Veronica] Sarah!</i>
        <i> - [Sarah] What?</i>

16:05.098 --> 16:08.967
Okay, the crazy violinist
     that fell off the roof.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.436
- You know what,
      you are so horrible.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.737
- Come on!

16:12.739 --> 16:15.006
(laughing)

16:15.008 --> 16:17.108
Is that seriously what's
       been bothering you?

16:18.578 --> 16:22.647
- I saw a memorial poster today.
    Just kind freaked me out.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.682
- Some people are
        just plain crazy.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.218
- Steve said
         she got pushed.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.187
- Trustworthy source.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.621
<i> - [Jude] It's a lot</i>
          <i> of pressure.</i>

16:31.658 --> 16:33.524
She was really driven.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.692
She was a really, really

16:34.694 --> 16:36.361
really great violinist.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.695
- Yeah and you're
          really good.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.430
You're a great
         violin player.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.567
<i> So stop scaring yourself</i>
      <i> with these stories.</i>

16:44.204 --> 16:47.305
- Yeah, look, if you let what
  happened to Emily get to you,

16:47.307 --> 16:49.407
then you actually
         will go crazy.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.608
- What I'm saying is

16:50.610 --> 16:52.310
it's a lot

16:52.312 --> 16:54.512
to handle that kind of genius.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.614
A lot of strength. Skill.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.516
A lot.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.085
Talent's a really
         dangerous drug.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.387
- It is.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.188
<i> Right, come on, Jude.</i>

17:04.190 --> 17:05.156
Stop obsessing.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.357
You're gonna be great.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.526
- Mr. Murphy doesn't
        seem to think so.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.294
- Oh, fuck him.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.563
<i> You're a winner, okay.</i>

17:12.565 --> 17:14.365
<i> Babe, you gotta loosen up.</i>

17:14.367 --> 17:16.666
<i> You're too tense.</i>

17:16.669 --> 17:19.503
- Tension is the
       opposite of slack.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.108
- Yeah?

17:25.111 --> 17:26.810
I told you I'd get
         you your money.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.080
No.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.548
(ominous music)

17:30.550 --> 17:33.384
She's my friend,
       I'm not doing that.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.320
Don't touch her.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.658
(violin scraping)

17:48.401 --> 17:50.134
<i> - Hey, loser!</i>

17:50.537 --> 17:52.370
Oh!

17:52.806 --> 17:54.639
It's you!

17:54.641 --> 17:55.840
<i> Here we go.</i>

17:55.842 --> 17:57.542
(eerie music)

17:57.544 --> 17:59.577
How do you get to
         Carnegie Hall?

18:01.414 --> 18:04.282
Practice! Practice!
            Practice!

18:04.284 --> 18:05.817
<i> Loser!</i>

18:06.453 --> 18:07.685
You suck!

18:08.388 --> 18:10.354
<i> You fucking suck!</i>

18:11.124 --> 18:12.323
<i> You stupid bitch!</i>

18:12.325 --> 18:13.391
(menacing music)

18:13.393 --> 18:15.726
(screaming)

18:17.297 --> 18:19.831
(somber music)

18:30.343 --> 18:31.843
- What are you afraid of?

18:33.746 --> 18:35.062
- I just--

18:35.063 --> 18:36.379
<i> - You have been anxious.</i>

18:37.183 --> 18:39.250
You've been distracted.

18:39.252 --> 18:43.154
Now, either you have done the
   work of the last four years

18:43.156 --> 18:44.655
or you haven't.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.758
- No, I'm fully committed.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.160
- Are you?

18:49.562 --> 18:51.129
Have you been?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.370
- Do you think
        Emily was pushed?

19:00.874 --> 19:04.809
Or do you think she
        just went crazy?

19:04.811 --> 19:07.245
Like the police said.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.714
- Jude, find your focus.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.415
Talking about Emily
         will not help.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.185
- No, I will.
           I'm trying.

19:14.187 --> 19:17.555
- Sometimes trying
       is just not enough.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.358
<i> We have spent a lot</i>
        <i> of time together</i>

19:20.360 --> 19:23.528
and I want to see it
      count for something.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.464
(ominous music)

19:30.837 --> 19:32.537
(sighing)

19:33.473 --> 19:35.340
<i> - [Jude] No, but</i>
        <i> that's my point.</i>

19:35.341 --> 19:37.208
<i> That's the difference between</i>
     <i> fiction and real life.</i>

19:37.210 --> 19:38.910
The fiction has
         to be logical.

19:38.912 --> 19:41.579
- Well, David Lynch makes
  complete sense. It's just the

19:41.581 --> 19:42.480
<i> logic of a dream.</i>

19:42.482 --> 19:43.347
(eerie music)

19:43.349 --> 19:45.183
<i> - Give me a break.</i>

19:45.185 --> 19:46.217
Go.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.686
- "Do I make you
          horny, baby?"

19:48.688 --> 19:51.255
<i> - [Jude] Seriously,</i>
         <i> no, you don't.</i>

19:51.257 --> 19:52.490
It's too easy, Steve.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.458
- [Veronica] And
        too pushy, Steve.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.760
- Let's think here.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.629
- "Zampano is here."

19:58.631 --> 20:00.264
- [Veronica]
        Zampano is here?

20:00.266 --> 20:00.932
(menacing music)

20:00.934 --> 20:01.799
(crashing)

20:01.801 --> 20:03.434
(dog barking)

20:03.436 --> 20:04.435
- Whoa!

20:04.437 --> 20:05.937
- I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, guys.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.372
- "Ah. Good evening,
          Mr. Torrance.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.373
"Your regular?"

20:09.375 --> 20:10.541
- The Shining.
        Too easy, Steve.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.060
- Everyone,

20:12.061 --> 20:13.578
this is my shiny new
         roommate, Dave.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.579
- Oh, hey, Dave.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.214
<i> - [Steve] This is Veronica.</i>

20:16.216 --> 20:17.615
- Wait, what happened
      to "Zampano is here?"

20:17.617 --> 20:19.283
- Oh, you guys are playing
         the movie game

20:19.285 --> 20:21.352
that Steve told me about.
             - Yeah.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.654
- And this is Dave's
      monster dog, Taliban.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.922
- [Sarah] Aw.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.924
- It's not Taliban.
          It's Caliban

20:26.926 --> 20:28.292
from The Tempest?

20:28.294 --> 20:29.327
(laughing)

20:29.329 --> 20:30.345
- That makes sense.

20:30.346 --> 20:31.362
- That's Shakespeare, Steve.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.430
- Oh, thank you, Veronica.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.831
- You're welcome.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.334
- And he's not as
     ferocious as he seems.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.902
- Wait, wait, wait.

20:37.904 --> 20:38.936
Steve, I'm sorry.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.805
So you're roommate was home

20:40.807 --> 20:42.707
and you came over for dinner?

20:42.709 --> 20:44.342
- Oh.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.244
- It's fine,
         I already ate.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.312
<i> - [Veronica] Here,</i>
       <i> here. Take a seat.</i>

20:48.314 --> 20:49.914
- Okay, just never mind that.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.416
Can you say British
          things like,

20:52.418 --> 20:54.852
"easy peasy" or um,

20:54.854 --> 20:57.288
"can I get into
         your knickers?"

20:58.324 --> 20:59.991
- [Steve] Say, uh,

20:59.993 --> 21:02.293
say "bollocks."
    Say, "Bob's your uncle."

21:02.295 --> 21:03.127
- "Bob's your uncle."

21:03.128 --> 21:03.960
- Is that what
       you guys say? Bob?

21:03.963 --> 21:05.730
- Yeah, we say that. Yeah.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.365
I've got one.

21:07.767 --> 21:08.966
"Bugger off."

21:10.970 --> 21:13.471
- That's pretty sexy.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.306
- The hot girl with
        no fashion sense,

21:15.308 --> 21:16.674
<i> that's Sarah.</i>

21:16.676 --> 21:18.342
- [Sarah] Bonjour.

21:18.344 --> 21:20.678
- She's kind of like
        Mata Hari, so...

21:20.680 --> 21:21.545
- Hi, Sarah.

21:21.547 --> 21:22.413
- Hi.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.348
What the hell's Mata Hari?

21:24.350 --> 21:26.317
- Greta Garbo.
             - Spy.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.385
- [Steve] Exactly.
         - [Jude] 1931.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.819
- 1931. Um-hm.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.022
And this is--

21:31.024 --> 21:32.857
- Jude.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.691
<i> Pleased to meet you,</i>
        <i> Jude. And also,</i>

21:34.694 --> 21:35.760
La Strada.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.762
- Huh?
         - [Sarah] What?

21:37.764 --> 21:38.763
- Right.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.831
- "Zampano is here."
           La Strada.

21:40.833 --> 21:41.432
It's from the movie,
           La Strada.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.434
(laughing)

21:43.435 --> 21:45.435
- Steve, I'm sorry, you said
   he thinks he knows movies.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.773
- He's okay, I guess.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.275
- And I have one.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.776
<i> - [Jude] Okay.</i>
           <i> - A line.</i>

21:51.778 --> 21:53.778
- [Jude] Uh-huh.

21:55.848 --> 21:59.016
- "You are all my
         children now."

21:59.018 --> 22:00.384
- Oh, um.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.952
- [Veronica] Sarah,
            come on.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.138
(groaning)

22:04.139 --> 22:06.323
<i> Sarah, come on, we know this.</i>
    <i> Think-think-think-think.</i>

22:06.326 --> 22:07.792
- Freddy Krueger.

22:07.794 --> 22:08.759
- She's got it.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.461
<i> Jude nailed it.</i>

22:10.463 --> 22:12.063
- Nightmare on Elm Street Two.
         - [Dave] Bingo!

22:12.065 --> 22:15.333
- She got it! She
       got it! (cheering)

22:15.335 --> 22:16.834
- Shit.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.603
- [Steve] Jude
       gets it. She wins.

22:19.605 --> 22:21.472
- Well, on that note,

22:21.474 --> 22:24.442
I think that calls
          for a cheers.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.010
- Thank you. Cheers.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.111
- Cheers, Jude.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.485
- I win.

22:35.655 --> 22:36.821
- Yeah, she does.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.456
(laughing)

22:41.127 --> 22:43.561
(thudding)

22:48.668 --> 22:51.001
(whooshing)

22:56.109 --> 22:57.608
- Sarah!

22:58.745 --> 23:01.479
- Jude, you're done with
      your laundry, right?

23:01.481 --> 23:03.547
- Yeah, almost.
       It's in the dryer.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.116
But just almost done.

23:05.118 --> 23:06.284
- Okay.

23:06.285 --> 23:07.451
You know we have to
      stay on schedule if--

23:07.453 --> 23:08.853
<i> - So Sarah's upstairs.</i>

23:08.855 --> 23:10.087
<i> - Yeah.</i>

23:11.624 --> 23:12.690
- Yeah, she keeps
      dropping her garbage

23:12.692 --> 23:13.858
down the laundry chute.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.460
- I know, I keep telling her.

23:16.462 --> 23:17.862
It's not my job to keep up
   with other people's laundry

23:17.864 --> 23:19.597
and garbage in this house.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.801
- Okay. It's fine.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.403
<i> - I'm just saying.</i>

23:25.405 --> 23:26.570
- Sarah?

23:27.039 --> 23:29.907
(glass shattering)

23:29.909 --> 23:30.908
- Oh!

23:30.910 --> 23:32.076
Hey, what's up?

23:34.013 --> 23:35.913
- So this is?

23:35.915 --> 23:36.781
This is art?

23:37.817 --> 23:40.451
- Yeah, it's raw
     material for my lover.

23:40.453 --> 23:42.019
Do you like him?

23:42.021 --> 23:44.789
I was thinking about
     doing a m√©nage √† trois.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.624
Or do you think
      that's too ambitious?

23:46.626 --> 23:48.559
- No, not for you.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.027
- You wanna try?

23:50.029 --> 23:51.996
It's so therapeutic.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.498
<i> Go on, you've been</i>
        <i> working so hard.</i>

23:54.500 --> 23:56.167
<i> You gotta let it out.</i>

23:58.037 --> 23:59.770
- I'm good.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.005
- Yeah?

24:01.007 --> 24:02.807
- But, uh, be careful.
      Don't hurt yourself.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.708
- I'm using protection.

24:04.710 --> 24:05.643
As always.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.611
- Okay.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.680
And don't drop your garbage
 down the laundry chute anymore.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.615
- Yes, ma'am.

24:11.617 --> 24:12.950
- Thank you.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.986
(ominous music)

24:19.926 --> 24:21.659
(wind blowing)

24:58.664 --> 25:01.665
(foreboding music)

25:12.612 --> 25:15.646
(menacing music)

25:28.227 --> 25:30.127
<i> - [Jude] Do you ever get</i>
  <i> the feeling like someone's,</i>

25:30.129 --> 25:31.829
<i> like, watching you?</i>

25:32.632 --> 25:33.764
- Not really.

25:34.634 --> 25:36.667
- Yeah, I just...

25:36.669 --> 25:39.169
I've been having this
      weird feeling lately

25:39.171 --> 25:42.006
like someone's watching me

25:42.008 --> 25:44.642
and following me and

25:44.644 --> 25:46.911
messing with my stuff.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.581
- I'd like to mess
        with your stuff.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.315
<i> Sorry.</i>

25:51.317 --> 25:53.067
(giggling)

25:53.068 --> 25:54.818
I don't know, could it
      be one of the girls?

25:54.820 --> 25:58.088
Could they be going through
     your underwear drawer?

25:58.090 --> 26:00.608
Maybe Sarah?

26:00.609 --> 26:03.127
I can totally picture
    Sarah in your underwear.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.695
- Oh, really?

26:04.697 --> 26:09.700
- And not looking anywhere
   near as attractive as you.

26:09.702 --> 26:11.835
Or sexy.

26:11.837 --> 26:14.138
Or talented.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.908
<i> Intelligent or</i>
         <i> understanding.</i>

26:17.910 --> 26:18.943
<i> Sexy?</i>

26:18.945 --> 26:20.578
<i> Did I mention sexy?</i>

26:20.580 --> 26:21.946
<i> Really, you're sexy.</i>

26:21.948 --> 26:23.781
- Yeah, you're not
        so bad yourself.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.350
You've got a really good
     head on your shoulders.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.852
<i> - Well, the rest of</i>
    <i> me's not so bad either.</i>

26:28.854 --> 26:30.020
- Yeah.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.655
When am I seeing you?

26:31.657 --> 26:33.257
(distant train horn)

26:33.259 --> 26:35.759
- Um, yeah, um...

26:35.761 --> 26:37.328
Not this week.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.298
<i> 'Cause I gotta work nights</i>

26:41.300 --> 26:44.768
<i> and double shifts because</i>
     <i> finals are coming up.</i>

26:44.770 --> 26:46.103
- Um-hm.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.137
<i> - You know how it is.</i>

26:49.709 --> 26:50.992
- Yeah, I know.

26:50.993 --> 26:52.276
I'm pulling late rehearsals
        too so it's okay.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.846
- But, uh,...

26:56.682 --> 26:57.781
I miss you.

26:57.783 --> 26:58.916
<i> - I miss you.</i>

26:58.918 --> 27:00.651
- And, uh,

27:00.653 --> 27:01.986
I love you.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.921
- Love you too. Talk
          to you later.

27:03.923 --> 27:06.690
- [Sarah] Hi, sexy!

27:07.793 --> 27:10.361
- Hi, you're home late.

27:10.363 --> 27:11.829
I thought you
         were upstairs.

27:11.831 --> 27:12.830
- It's late?

27:12.832 --> 27:14.031
<i> - Yeah.</i>

27:14.032 --> 27:15.231
- Oh. I'm gonna go back out.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.635
- No! No! No! You can't.
       Don't go back out.

27:17.637 --> 27:18.969
- So it's early
        when I come back.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.371
- Come back to me.

27:20.373 --> 27:21.905
Let's go.

27:21.907 --> 27:24.041
- Oh, I did the dance.

27:24.043 --> 27:28.345
- No. You've had a little
       too much to drink.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.080
(giggling)

27:30.082 --> 27:32.282
- You should come
          out with me.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.018
You're working too hard.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.253
- Yeah, well try-outs
       first and then fun.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.256
- See? There's always an excuse.

27:39.258 --> 27:45.329
How is your love life on
  that tiny screen satisfying?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.330
I don't get it.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.665
- You scare me, Sarah.

27:47.667 --> 27:48.766
- Why?

27:48.768 --> 27:50.701
Just open up! God!

27:52.004 --> 27:55.105
You have sex and then you
  get in touch with your body.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.307
Then you do better art.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.009
I mean, seriously.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.377
Ben is adorable.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.212
Why aren't you having
        sex with him yet?

28:02.214 --> 28:04.214
- Okay.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.783
Hear me out.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.118
Veronica just
         made brownies.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.254
I think we should have two,

28:10.256 --> 28:11.455
not tell her.

28:11.457 --> 28:12.322
- Okay.

28:12.324 --> 28:13.290
- And see if she notices.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.224
- Okay!

28:16.395 --> 28:19.129
(violin music)

28:24.737 --> 28:26.904
(intense violin scratching)

28:29.442 --> 28:31.375
(string breaking)

28:31.377 --> 28:33.477
(eerie music)

28:33.479 --> 28:36.013
(screaming)

28:39.118 --> 28:41.919
(ominous music)

29:24.897 --> 29:26.997
(gasping)

29:42.181 --> 29:44.381
(somber guitar music)

29:46.886 --> 29:49.419
(Jude humming)

29:50.356 --> 29:52.422
(distant train horn)

29:57.930 --> 30:00.931
(guitar strumming)

30:05.204 --> 30:07.471
- That was terrible and that
   was not what I was playing.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.872
- What were you playing?

30:08.874 --> 30:11.175
- Paganini's Caprice
           Number 24.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.342
- Okay.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.977
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.113
(somber strumming)

30:16.115 --> 30:18.248
- No. No.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.385
No. Sorry.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.888
<i> - I'll get there.</i>

30:26.425 --> 30:28.258
- Hey, were you watching
         me last night?

30:30.563 --> 30:32.262
<i> Well?</i>

30:32.264 --> 30:33.530
- That's really weird.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.933
Last night, Cal was
    barking and he woke me up

30:35.935 --> 30:38.836
and I had the strangest feeling
    that I was being watched.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.270
But

30:40.272 --> 30:43.240
I looked out the window,
      I didn't see anyone.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.875
I thought it must
       be my imagination,

30:44.877 --> 30:45.976
but now I'm thinking

30:45.978 --> 30:47.878
I was wrong, Jude,

30:47.880 --> 30:49.546
because how would you know
   I was looking out my window

30:49.548 --> 30:51.915
unless I was actually
      being watched by you?

30:51.917 --> 30:53.417
- What?

30:53.419 --> 30:55.385
No, I was just, I thought,
        I was looking...

30:55.387 --> 30:56.954
- Have you been
          spying on me?

30:56.956 --> 30:58.155
- No, I...

30:58.157 --> 31:00.123
You know what,
    this little British thing

31:00.125 --> 31:01.358
it's not gonna work on me.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.393
- Oh, really? That's a shame.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.128
Usually it works.

31:05.130 --> 31:06.496
Been listening to
         you play music.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.364
- Really?

31:07.366 --> 31:09.066
What do you think?

31:09.068 --> 31:10.234
- It's good.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.468
Not quite there yet, though.

31:11.470 --> 31:12.536
- Oh.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.872
So just pretty good?

31:15.474 --> 31:17.174
I happen to be very good.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.043
- But are you excellent?

31:20.646 --> 31:22.880
- Yeah, I think so.

31:22.882 --> 31:23.881
- Good.

31:23.883 --> 31:24.948
(strumming)

31:25.985 --> 31:27.918
- Your A-string's
          out of tune.

31:27.920 --> 31:28.585
- I knew that.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.320
<i> - [Jude] Um-hm.</i>

31:30.322 --> 31:31.488
- Ta-ta, Jude.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.259
- Hey.
          - [Jude] Hey.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.960
(somber strumming)

31:36.962 --> 31:38.328
<i> - [Veronica] You're</i>
          <i> home early.</i>

31:38.330 --> 31:41.265
- Yeah. Murphy had some
      kind of faculty thing

31:41.267 --> 31:42.966
so he let me go early.

31:42.968 --> 31:45.369
(ominous music)

31:46.605 --> 31:50.107
- [Veronica] Well,
  was it at least better today?

31:50.109 --> 31:51.975
- Yeah. It was good.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.310
- That's nice.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.346
<i> - [Jude] Ben?</i>

31:57.516 --> 31:58.982
Ben?

31:58.984 --> 32:00.350
<i> - [Veronica] What?</i>

32:00.352 --> 32:02.519
This is Ben's jacket.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.254
- Maybe in your room?

32:04.256 --> 32:06.056
Whoa, okay. I thought
     he wasn't coming today.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.008
- Ben?

32:08.009 --> 32:09.959
<i> - [Veronica] Think</i>
     <i> he'll stay for dinner?</i>

32:12.998 --> 32:15.933
(Sarah sexually moaning)

32:24.677 --> 32:27.377
(Sarah and Ben giggling)

32:27.379 --> 32:28.979
<i> - [Ben] You said you</i>
    <i> wanted to do it though.</i>

32:28.981 --> 32:30.447
(Sarah shushing)

32:30.449 --> 32:33.250
(Sarah moaning)

32:37.189 --> 32:38.221
<i> - [Sarah] Oh my God.</i>

32:38.223 --> 32:40.190
<i> That feels so good.</i>

32:40.192 --> 32:41.725
<i> Oh, that's so good.</i>

32:41.727 --> 32:43.961
(Sarah moaning)

32:47.399 --> 32:50.267
(dramatic music)

32:54.006 --> 32:55.305
<i> - [Ben] Oh my God!</i>

32:55.307 --> 32:56.173
(laughing)

32:56.175 --> 32:57.441
<i> - [Sarah] Stop!</i>

32:59.378 --> 33:02.179
(Sarah moaning)

33:04.483 --> 33:06.216
(glass shattering)

33:06.218 --> 33:07.751
(Sarah screaming)

33:07.753 --> 33:09.353
- [Jude] Sarah, get out!
          - [Ben] Shit!

33:09.355 --> 33:10.287
- Get out!

33:10.289 --> 33:11.588
- It didn't mean anything.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.290
- Go, Sarah! Go, Sarah!

33:13.292 --> 33:14.157
You fucking bitch!

33:14.159 --> 33:15.175
- I'm not a bitch!

33:15.176 --> 33:16.192
<i> - [Ben] This isn't</i>
      <i> what it seems like.</i>

33:16.193 --> 33:17.209
- I hate that word.

33:17.210 --> 33:18.226
- Can you fucking
         hear yourself?

33:18.230 --> 33:20.197
You're definitely a bitch!

33:20.199 --> 33:22.165
- [Ben] Please! It was nothing.
     - [Jude] Ben, get out!

33:22.167 --> 33:23.244
- Jude, listen--

33:23.245 --> 33:24.322
- Stop, Ben. Leave!

33:24.323 --> 33:25.400
- I wanted to
          surprise you.

33:25.404 --> 33:26.737
- I'm sorry, you wanted
         to surprise me?

33:26.739 --> 33:28.138
I wasn't even
         gonna be here.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.256
- Jude.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.373
Jude, come on,
         don't do this.

33:30.376 --> 33:31.508
- Don't talk to me, Ben.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.076
- Come on, don't do this!

33:33.078 --> 33:34.478
<i> - [Veronica] What</i>
      <i> the hell's going on?</i>

33:34.480 --> 33:36.213
- Jude!

33:36.215 --> 33:38.648
(ominous music)

33:40.652 --> 33:43.053
<i> Jude, come on, hear me out.</i>

33:43.055 --> 33:44.755
<i> This isn't what it</i>
       <i> seems like, okay?</i>

33:44.757 --> 33:47.391
<i> We weren't, it wasn't,</i>
      <i> we didn't mean to...</i>

33:47.393 --> 33:49.760
<i> Come on, will you open</i>
       <i> the door, please?</i>

33:49.762 --> 33:51.762
<i> Can we talk about this?</i>

33:52.731 --> 33:55.198
(knocking)

33:55.200 --> 33:57.367
Jude, come on. What
     do you want me to say?

33:57.369 --> 33:59.269
If you had just
          been there...

33:59.271 --> 34:01.271
<i> - I just want you gone.</i>

34:06.812 --> 34:09.746
(foreboding music)

34:40.646 --> 34:43.280
- Hey, can I join you?

34:45.617 --> 34:46.817
- Sure.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.652
- Need a drink.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.290
- Where's Sarah?

34:53.292 --> 34:55.225
- Oh, she went out.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.127
Told her to give
         you some space.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.361
- Thank you.

34:58.363 --> 34:59.763
- Mm-hm.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.698
Where's the boyfriend?

35:03.168 --> 35:04.468
- He's gone.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.236
He's dead to me now.

35:06.238 --> 35:07.304
- Screw him.

35:08.173 --> 35:09.439
What are you doing?

35:09.441 --> 35:10.774
What is this?

35:11.743 --> 35:13.143
I don't even like
          this picture.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.478
Here, take this.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.483
This is...

35:19.485 --> 35:22.452
This is the most important
       time of your life.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.187
You know that, right?

35:25.224 --> 35:27.824
You can't let
        this get to you.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.526
This Sarah shit.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.128
This boyfriend bullshit.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.663
This Murphy stuff
     messing with your head.

35:34.766 --> 35:35.866
You don't have
         time for that.

35:35.868 --> 35:37.267
- Yeah.

35:37.269 --> 35:40.237
- You know you need to
       stay focused, okay?

35:40.239 --> 35:41.805
You know what you want.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.710
- Yeah, you're right.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.512
You're right.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.448
- And, um...

35:52.651 --> 35:57.154
Look, I think you need to
     delete these pictures.

35:57.156 --> 35:59.623
- No, come on.
         - We do. We do.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.724
I'll be the first.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.359
Look.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.161
Delete.

36:06.265 --> 36:09.199
That was easy. Your turn.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.667
Come on.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.503
- Delete.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.504
- One more.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.058
- Delete.

36:18.059 --> 36:19.842
- Delicious. Now let's
    just take a shot. Do it.

36:22.447 --> 36:23.813
- I don't want to do it.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.782
Move. Move.

36:25.784 --> 36:26.716
- Come on.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.919
- Move over.
         - Delete them.

36:28.921 --> 36:31.655
- All right.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.557
Delete.
     - Yep. I hate that one.

36:33.559 --> 36:34.925
Come on.

36:34.927 --> 36:35.892
(laughing)

36:35.894 --> 36:38.929
- Delete.
      - [Veronica] Delete.

36:38.931 --> 36:41.398
- Delete. You do it.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.967
- Don't mind if I do.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.402
- Delete.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.237
- Bye, bye, Ben.

36:47.239 --> 36:48.638
- Delete.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.740
Delete. Delete.

36:52.244 --> 36:55.478
(somber music)

36:55.480 --> 36:58.415
(water trickling)

37:04.957 --> 37:07.857
(humming)

37:07.859 --> 37:10.727
(doorbell ringing)

37:14.633 --> 37:15.999
- Hello?

37:16.735 --> 37:18.635
Can somebody get that?

37:18.637 --> 37:21.871
(doorbell ringing)

37:21.873 --> 37:23.840
Hello?

37:25.344 --> 37:27.544
Is anybody home?

37:29.248 --> 37:31.881
(doorbell ringing)

37:35.020 --> 37:37.487
(knocking on door)

37:42.961 --> 37:45.262
What? Hello?

37:45.264 --> 37:47.397
- Sorry.
          - [Jude] Hey.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.432
- We all go a little
         mad sometimes.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.618
- What?

37:51.619 --> 37:52.868
<i> - With the knocking,</i>
     <i> if I did it too much.</i>

37:52.871 --> 37:54.304
We all go a little
         mad sometimes.

37:54.306 --> 37:55.972
The line from the
        movie, The Game.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.407
- Oh, yeah.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.342
We all go a little mad.

37:59.344 --> 38:01.678
- Me being crazy.

38:01.679 --> 38:04.013
- Yeah, I'm not really in the
 mood for that right now. Sorry.

38:04.016 --> 38:05.915
- Okay, well I came over because
   Steve and I wanted to know

38:05.917 --> 38:09.286
if you and the girls want to
   join us for dinner tonight.

38:09.288 --> 38:10.987
- Thanks.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.557
I can't make it but
     I'll let Veronica know.

38:14.559 --> 38:15.759
- Okay, cool.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.460
- Okay, bye.

38:17.462 --> 38:18.762
<i> - How about--</i>

38:19.765 --> 38:21.765
How about this?

38:21.767 --> 38:23.767
You and I spend
       some time together.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.503
- Uhh...

38:26.505 --> 38:28.672
I'm just really
         busy right now.

38:31.376 --> 38:33.443
- Okay. Message received.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.477
Loud and clear.

38:34.479 --> 38:35.345
- Okay.

38:35.347 --> 38:36.012
- See you later.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.514
- Bye.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.460
Hey!

38:52.431 --> 38:53.530
Psycho.

38:54.399 --> 38:55.532
- What?

38:55.534 --> 38:57.000
- Psycho.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.402
It's the line
         from the movie.

38:59.404 --> 39:00.770
- Correct.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.072
Very impressive, Jude.

39:02.074 --> 39:04.607
(distant train horn)

39:04.609 --> 39:06.643
So, um, dinner tomorrow night?

39:08.447 --> 39:09.779
- We'll see.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.582
- We'll see?

39:22.461 --> 39:24.994
(somber music)

39:27.566 --> 39:28.898
- What? You just
        ignore the door?

39:28.900 --> 39:29.833
- I was working.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.318
- Working. Working.

39:31.319 --> 39:32.802
Yeah, you're the only one
   to have work to do, Sarah.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.137
- Was it important?

39:35.474 --> 39:36.740
<i> Dave?</i>

39:37.476 --> 39:39.442
He is cute.

39:40.679 --> 39:43.012
(eerie music)

39:48.019 --> 39:50.687
(wind howling)

40:05.437 --> 40:07.604
(distant train horn)

40:09.808 --> 40:12.509
(ominous music)

40:18.617 --> 40:20.650
- Hey.
             - Hey.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.085
A big storm is
        coming tomorrow.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.086
Storm shutters.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.588
- Katrina big?

40:24.589 --> 40:26.089
- They didn't predict
       that one correctly,

40:26.091 --> 40:28.525
so let's just get ready.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.093
- How long's it
        supposed to last?

40:30.095 --> 40:31.861
I have my try-out coming up.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.096
- I don't know.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.197
- All done?
       - [Veronica] Yeah.

40:34.199 --> 40:35.999
- All right, I'm
       gonna go upstairs.

40:36.001 --> 40:38.001
- Hey, wait. Anything new?

40:38.003 --> 40:39.602
Talked to Sarah?

40:39.604 --> 40:41.171
- Seriously?

40:41.173 --> 40:42.839
- Well, you two need
       to work things out.

40:42.841 --> 40:43.807
- Why?

40:43.809 --> 40:44.908
- Because we
         live together.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.676
- She slept with
          my boyfriend.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.178
I'm the one who's supposed
      to make things nice?

40:48.180 --> 40:49.446
<i> - Look, she can't help it.</i>

40:49.448 --> 40:51.014
She's a very open person.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.949
- You mean,
        a complete slut.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.520
- Jude, she's comfortable
        with who she is.

40:57.522 --> 40:59.522
And it wasn't
         only her fault.

40:59.524 --> 41:02.459
- Are you serious? Why
     are you defending her?

41:05.464 --> 41:06.896
Whose side are you on?

41:06.898 --> 41:09.833
Are you on her side or
       are you on my side?

41:09.835 --> 41:11.100
- Look,

41:11.102 --> 41:13.002
this is just like that
      order and chaos thing

41:13.004 --> 41:14.204
you're talking about.

41:14.206 --> 41:15.572
<i> Right?</i>

41:15.574 --> 41:17.073
You need to pull
          it together.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.042
It's time to get a
       hold of your mess.

41:23.548 --> 41:24.881
- Fine.

41:25.684 --> 41:28.084
(eerie music)

41:31.256 --> 41:34.090
(phone alarm)

41:41.566 --> 41:43.833
(romantic violin music)

42:00.619 --> 42:02.185
(wind blowing)

42:02.187 --> 42:04.521
(somber guitar music)

42:12.831 --> 42:14.831
(somber violin music)

42:21.740 --> 42:24.140
(somber guitar music)

42:32.551 --> 42:35.752
(somber violin music)

42:45.931 --> 42:46.913
- Wow.

42:46.914 --> 42:47.896
That was really good,
              Jude.

42:47.899 --> 42:48.898
You're talented.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.985
So

42:51.986 --> 42:54.070
you wanna go for a drink
     downstairs at the bar?

42:54.072 --> 42:54.938
- Steve's?

42:54.940 --> 42:56.172
<i> - Yeah.</i>

42:56.174 --> 42:57.740
- It's kind of a dive.

42:57.742 --> 43:00.577
- Well, I hear that the
   bartender's very talented.

43:00.579 --> 43:01.911
- Oh.

43:01.913 --> 43:02.779
Okay.

43:02.781 --> 43:04.214
<i> - Yeah?</i>

43:04.215 --> 43:05.648
<i> - Yeah.</i>
     <i> - See you downstairs.</i>

43:30.675 --> 43:32.108
- Hey, Jude.

43:32.110 --> 43:33.643
- Oh, Steve, hey.

43:33.645 --> 43:35.878
Sorry, I was, I'm gonna--

43:35.880 --> 43:36.913
- Something wrong?

43:36.915 --> 43:37.914
- No.

43:37.916 --> 43:38.948
No, yeah, I'm good.

43:38.950 --> 43:41.217
- Jude, Jude, hi.

43:47.158 --> 43:49.826
Uh, is there a guest list?

43:49.828 --> 43:52.095
(chuckling)

43:54.633 --> 43:56.399
- You guys talking
         about classes?

44:00.271 --> 44:02.305
- Uh, surely you
        can't be serious.

44:03.742 --> 44:05.375
- I am serious.

44:06.344 --> 44:07.877
Don't call me Shirley.

44:07.879 --> 44:08.911
- Yeah.

44:08.913 --> 44:10.113
- Airplane.

44:10.115 --> 44:11.714
<i> Nice one.</i>

44:12.183 --> 44:13.916
- Yep.

44:20.225 --> 44:23.326
- So, what are you having?

44:23.328 --> 44:25.061
- The usual.

44:25.664 --> 44:26.896
- Which is what?

44:26.898 --> 44:28.164
- Martini.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.867
- "Shaken, not stirred."

44:30.869 --> 44:32.969
- "Stirred, not shaken."

44:32.971 --> 44:34.771
- If it is a martini,
   you're not allowed to look

44:34.773 --> 44:36.973
where I get the olives from
    'cause it is disgusting.

44:36.975 --> 44:37.974
- Oh, okay.
             - Okay?

44:37.976 --> 44:39.008
- So romantic.

44:39.010 --> 44:41.194
- That's me.

44:41.195 --> 44:43.379
<i> Okay, I grab a couple</i>
       <i> of these bad boys.</i>

44:43.381 --> 44:46.215
<i> There's at least seven types</i>
  <i> of bacteria in this fridge.</i>

44:46.217 --> 44:48.718
<i> I've named each one of them.</i>

44:48.720 --> 44:49.952
Okay.

44:49.954 --> 44:51.888
- Okay?

44:51.890 --> 44:53.356
- You can look now.
         Damage is done.

44:53.358 --> 44:56.759
Okay, and then I...
     How do I do this again?

44:56.761 --> 44:59.162
<i> Don't knock it until you try</i>
   <i> it. I know it looks gross.</i>

44:59.164 --> 45:00.863
Hang on.

45:00.865 --> 45:02.265
- Creative.

45:02.267 --> 45:03.933
(sloshing)

45:03.935 --> 45:06.436
- It goes everywhere
           every time.

45:06.438 --> 45:08.171
Maybe you should've
           done that.

45:08.173 --> 45:10.206
- I think I'm gonna
         stick to music.

45:10.208 --> 45:12.108
But thank you.

45:12.110 --> 45:15.244
(somber radio music)

45:18.717 --> 45:23.352
- Um so, how long have
     you been playing music?

45:23.354 --> 45:26.956
- I've been holding a violin
 for as long as I can remember.

45:26.958 --> 45:29.992
- So the violin is
       older than you are.

45:29.994 --> 45:31.961
- It's 103, yeah.

45:31.963 --> 45:33.062
It's a Gagliano.

45:33.064 --> 45:33.996
<i> Great grandmother's.</i>

45:33.998 --> 45:36.199
- Wow.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.401
I've heard of Battista,
        are they similar?

45:40.071 --> 45:42.472
- They both have strings.

45:42.474 --> 45:44.173
- Okay, right.

45:44.175 --> 45:47.376
<i> I don't think this</i>
         <i> will kill you,</i>

45:47.378 --> 45:48.911
but give it a go.

45:48.913 --> 45:50.246
- Okay.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.248
- And it's good to
      see you again, Jude.

45:54.219 --> 45:55.384
- Yeah.

45:55.386 --> 45:57.286
- Cheers.
            - Cheers.

45:57.288 --> 45:59.455
(thudding)

45:59.457 --> 46:01.190
- Hi, Cal!

46:01.192 --> 46:03.159
- Hey, bud, get down. Come on.

46:03.161 --> 46:04.527
- Hi!

46:04.529 --> 46:07.063
- Jeez, you know how to
     steal a man's thunder,

46:07.065 --> 46:08.131
don't you, boy?

46:08.133 --> 46:09.465
- You gotta be careful.

46:09.467 --> 46:10.967
I'm on a rebound.

46:10.969 --> 46:14.036
- Yeah, I heard about
        that. I'm sorry.

46:14.038 --> 46:15.371
- Yeah.

46:15.373 --> 46:16.873
You know, when you
      find your best friend

46:16.875 --> 46:18.975
<i> in bed with your</i>
     <i> boyfriend, it's uh...</i>

46:20.311 --> 46:22.695
Sorry.

46:22.696 --> 46:25.080
First date, you're not
  supposed to talk about exes.

46:25.083 --> 46:27.784
- So this is a date. Okay.

46:27.786 --> 46:29.986
<i> Thought it was</i>
      <i> just a drink but...</i>

46:31.289 --> 46:32.955
- What about you?

46:34.125 --> 46:35.858
<i> You're new in town.</i>

46:35.860 --> 46:37.527
Did you leave
         anyone behind?

46:40.865 --> 46:43.266
- Um...

46:45.837 --> 46:48.404
Look, I-- We just met.

46:48.406 --> 46:51.307
I didn't want to make
     this weird or anything.

46:51.309 --> 46:52.842
- I'm not taken.

46:53.912 --> 46:57.914
<i> I mean, I was seeing</i>
         <i> someone and...</i>

46:57.916 --> 46:59.882
I'm not anymore.

47:02.153 --> 47:05.021
- Did you dump her or
       did she dump you or

47:05.023 --> 47:07.824
was it some, like, mutual thing?

47:11.396 --> 47:13.529
- Actually, she...

47:13.531 --> 47:14.397
Sorry.

47:14.399 --> 47:15.431
She died.

47:16.501 --> 47:18.334
- I'm sorry.

47:18.335 --> 47:20.168
<i> - No, it's okay. You wanted</i>
      <i> to know. It's fine.</i>

47:24.042 --> 47:25.308
- Hi, Steve.

47:26.411 --> 47:27.944
- Hey.

47:28.479 --> 47:30.279
I was reading something.

47:30.281 --> 47:32.181
You know, they say that
    we're the last generation

47:32.183 --> 47:33.616
to enjoy sex.

47:36.487 --> 47:38.020
- Who?

47:38.022 --> 47:39.021
Who's they?

47:40.225 --> 47:40.957
A scientist.

47:40.959 --> 47:43.109
<i> - Oh.</i>

47:43.110 --> 47:45.260
- Apparently it's a reaction
    to over-population, so...

47:45.263 --> 47:47.496
Pretty soon, sex drive's
    just going to disappear.

47:47.498 --> 47:49.532
No more pleasure.

47:49.534 --> 47:51.934
No more sex.

47:51.936 --> 47:53.236
No more people.

47:58.910 --> 48:00.476
- All right.

48:00.478 --> 48:02.111
Well, yeah.

48:02.113 --> 48:04.247
Quite the optimist,
       Steve, aren't you?

48:04.249 --> 48:06.949
- Well, I mean, I know
        mine still works.

48:06.951 --> 48:08.517
What about yours?

48:16.995 --> 48:18.227
- I gotta go.

48:18.229 --> 48:19.495
I have rehearsal.

48:19.497 --> 48:21.464
Yeah, but um...

48:21.466 --> 48:23.165
Thank you.

48:23.167 --> 48:24.500
Delightful.

48:24.502 --> 48:26.369
(chuckling)

48:27.238 --> 48:28.571
Okay, yeah. I'll see you.

48:28.573 --> 48:30.039
- Yeah.
          -<i> [Jude] Bye.</i>

48:30.041 --> 48:31.340

48:33.378 --> 48:35.044

48:35.046 --> 48:37.613

48:38.616 --> 48:39.548

48:41.085 --> 48:42.285
Hey.

48:44.689 --> 48:45.922
Keep warm.

48:45.924 --> 48:47.089
- Oh.

48:47.091 --> 48:48.357
Thank you.

48:49.961 --> 48:52.061
- And, um, yeah.

48:54.465 --> 48:56.065
See you later.

50:40.438 --> 50:41.437
What? What?

50:41.439 --> 50:42.638
- Jude, I need
         to talk to you.

50:42.640 --> 50:43.739
- What? What's up?

50:43.741 --> 50:44.807
- It's about Dave.

50:44.809 --> 50:46.542
- Stop, I'm a
         big girl, okay?

50:46.544 --> 50:47.710
I don't need--

50:47.712 --> 50:49.211
- What? Listen to me.

50:49.213 --> 50:51.213
He's not who you
       think he is at all.

50:51.215 --> 50:53.516
He's some kind of stalker.

50:53.518 --> 50:55.217
- Seriously? A stalker?

50:55.219 --> 50:56.318
- I'm serious, Jude.

50:56.320 --> 50:58.154
<i> I was up--</i>

- Hey.

51:02.093 --> 51:03.692
- Hi. Lunch is ready.

51:07.231 --> 51:09.698
- You don't mind
        if I join, right?

51:11.736 --> 51:13.769
- I thought it was gonna
    be just us two, actually.

51:13.771 --> 51:16.305
- Oh, well I wouldn't
        want to intrude.

51:16.307 --> 51:18.607

51:25.650 --> 51:26.849

55:02.867 --> 55:04.767
- Why don't you ask him

55:04.768 --> 55:06.668
what classes he's
       taking this summer?

55:06.671 --> 55:08.404
That is why you're here,

55:08.406 --> 55:09.738
isn't it, Dave?

55:10.675 --> 55:13.075
(thunder)

55:13.944 --> 55:16.512
"You shall not pass."

55:18.983 --> 55:22.451
- I mean I thought he would
    be taking guitar, right?

55:30.561 --> 55:32.027
- No, I'm not
         actually, Jude.

55:32.029 --> 55:34.897
- Yeah, Jude, he's not taking
    any classes this summer.

55:34.899 --> 55:36.098
I checked.

55:37.435 --> 55:39.368
Ask him yourself if
      you don't believe me.

55:39.370 --> 55:40.969
- Okay.

55:41.472 --> 55:43.089
Dave.

55:43.090 --> 55:44.707
- Hey, maybe I'm
       just a bit paranoid

55:44.709 --> 55:46.041
because of what I
        do for a living.

55:46.043 --> 55:47.543
- Steve?

55:48.612 --> 55:50.713
- There was always
      something about you.

55:50.715 --> 55:52.848
<i> A little too perfect.</i>

55:52.850 --> 55:55.651
Like the handsome English
       dude in the movies

55:55.653 --> 55:57.519
that always ends up
        being the killer.

55:57.521 --> 55:58.954
- Really?

56:00.091 --> 56:01.990
See, I always thought it
      was the comic relief

56:01.992 --> 56:03.359
that turned out
        to be the killer.

56:03.361 --> 56:04.827
Isn't that you, Steve?

56:04.829 --> 56:07.429
(thunder)

56:09.633 --> 56:10.999
- You wanna know
        what I found out?

56:11.001 --> 56:12.134
- You know what, okay.

56:12.136 --> 56:13.569
I'm gonna go out
         into the storm

56:13.570 --> 56:15.003
because it might be
      a little less tense.

56:15.005 --> 56:18.674
- Goddamn it, Jude, that's
 what I was telling you outside.

56:18.676 --> 56:20.476
<i> He's been taking</i>
        <i> pictures of you.</i>

56:20.478 --> 56:21.777
He's stalking you.

56:21.779 --> 56:24.513
- What are you gonna
         show her, mate?

56:25.750 --> 56:26.682
Pictures?

56:27.651 --> 56:29.651
Pictures that you
         could've taken?

56:29.653 --> 56:31.453
You could've planted.

56:32.823 --> 56:34.022
I'm the stalker.

56:34.792 --> 56:35.958
I just got here, Steve.

56:35.960 --> 56:38.494
How long have you been
       pining after Jude?

56:38.496 --> 56:39.728
I've seen the way
        you look at her,

56:39.730 --> 56:42.164
that pathetic puppy-dog
       look in your eyes.

56:44.702 --> 56:47.169
I'm telling you, Steve,

56:47.171 --> 56:50.506
you do not know what you're
     getting yourself into.

56:50.508 --> 56:52.107
<i> This ends right now.</i>

56:53.677 --> 56:54.943
You understand?

56:57.615 --> 56:59.148
Good.

56:59.150 --> 57:00.983
Come on, Jude.

57:03.554 --> 57:05.187
Jude?

57:06.490 --> 57:08.090
All right, whatever.

57:09.460 --> 57:11.527
- What? What is going on?

57:11.529 --> 57:13.662
- Why don't you believe me?

57:13.664 --> 57:15.164
Jude, why don't you
       ever listen to me?

57:15.166 --> 57:16.999
I'm not some fucking joke.

57:17.001 --> 57:18.200
- I know, Steve, I know.

57:18.202 --> 57:20.102
- I mean, since
         I've known you

57:20.103 --> 57:22.003
I've been the only guy
    who's been there for you.

57:22.006 --> 57:24.139
The only one who
        has cared for you

57:24.141 --> 57:26.575
and you just
        string me along,

57:26.577 --> 57:28.677
while you go from one guy
    who treats you like shit

57:28.679 --> 57:30.512
to this guy who
        is literally like

57:30.514 --> 57:32.214
Jack-the-fucking-Ripper.

57:32.216 --> 57:34.049
- Stop, Steve. Stop!

57:34.051 --> 57:35.451
I don't need to hear that.

57:35.452 --> 57:36.852
Whatever problem you're
       having with Dave--

57:36.854 --> 57:39.087
- Problem I'm
        having with Dave?

57:39.089 --> 57:41.457
You think this
         is my problem?

57:41.459 --> 57:43.625
Go in his room right now
    and see what he's hiding.

57:43.627 --> 57:45.928
You'll know whose
    fucking problem this is.

57:45.930 --> 57:47.980
(thundering)

57:47.981 --> 57:50.031
Does every woman I meet
   have to be a fucking whore?

57:52.970 --> 57:54.903
Or can you not
        handle the truth?

57:59.643 --> 58:01.844
(smack)

58:24.268 --> 58:27.135
(menacing music)

58:44.255 --> 58:47.256
(unsettling music)

59:09.613 --> 59:11.914
- Steve? Steve, Dave
     knew Emily. He did it!

59:15.753 --> 59:17.886
Breathe! Breathe!

59:17.888 --> 59:19.721
Breathe, Steve.

59:19.723 --> 59:21.557
Steve! Steve!

59:21.559 --> 59:22.691
Steve?!

59:22.693 --> 59:25.294
(dog snarling)

59:26.830 --> 59:29.197
(barking)

59:29.199 --> 59:31.133
(growling)

59:31.135 --> 59:33.835
(intense music)

59:33.837 --> 59:36.038
(barking)

59:39.276 --> 59:42.778
- Jude, I need
         to talk to you.

59:42.780 --> 59:45.647
(menacing music)

59:49.587 --> 59:51.320
(thud)

59:53.257 --> 59:54.890
- Monster!

59:54.892 --> 59:55.724
- Jude!

59:55.726 --> 59:58.093
(thunder rumbling)

59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.862
(intense music)

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.166
- Veronica!

01:00:05.002 --> 01:00:06.735
(groaning)

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:14.109
Veronica! Veronica!

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.718
(thudding)

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.319
(doorbell)

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.701
(whimpering)

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:47.109
(unsettling music)

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:57.152
(banging on door)

01:01:02.393 --> 01:01:04.026
<i> - [Dave] Can we talk?</i>

01:01:06.363 --> 01:01:08.330
- What do you want?

01:01:08.332 --> 01:01:12.334
<i> - [Dave] What I've</i>
      <i> wanted since we met.</i>

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:13.669
<i> Oh, Jude,</i>

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:17.172
<i> there's just</i>
      <i> something about you</i>

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.408
<i> that gets me crazy.</i>

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:23.011
- I don't know what
      you're talking about.

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:26.214
<i> - [Dave] It's a shame.</i>

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:28.115
<i> I had a feeling that</i>
       <i> you were perfect.</i>

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:30.352
<i> But alas, you're not.</i>

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:33.889
- What?

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:40.062
<i> - [Dave] What am I gonna</i>
     <i> do with you now, Jude?</i>

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:42.197
(Dave sighing)

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:44.933
<i> Will you open</i>
        <i> the door, Jude?</i>

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:48.970
(door handle rattling)

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.110
<i> Jude?</i>

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:57.713
<i> Please open the door.</i>

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.415
(thudding)

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.818
(intense music)

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:13.495
(windows banging)

01:02:30.748 --> 01:02:33.348
(ominous music)

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.819
(glass shattering)

01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:38.954
(intense music)

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:42.924
Sarah?!

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:46.361
(eerie music)

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:49.765
(Jude crying)

01:02:49.767 --> 01:03:00.175
(Jude whimpering)

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:01.543
Oh, my God.

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:05.113
(rain pouring)

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:18.426
(banging)

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:19.828
<i> - Jude!</i>

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:23.298
(intense music)

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.533
(yelling)

01:03:24.535 --> 01:03:27.035
<i> Jude!</i>

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:28.303
(Dave yelling)

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:38.213
(splashing)

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:48.256
(exciting music)

01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:58.366
(exciting music)

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:09.077
(exciting music)

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:14.983
(whoosh)

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:25.026
(thudding)

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:30.966
(thudding)

01:04:30.968 --> 01:04:32.868
- Veronica? Veronica?

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:33.969
Wake up!

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:45.213
(sobbing)

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:48.316
(footsteps)

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:58.059
(ominous music)

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:05.433
(footsteps)

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:15.477
(footsteps)

01:05:15.479 --> 01:05:25.587
(footsteps)

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:32.427
(footsteps)

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.429
- Here's Davey.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:39.067
(Jude screaming)

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:43.405
(total silence)

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:53.448
(ominous music)

01:05:53.450 --> 01:06:03.558
(ominous music)

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:15.470
(ominous music)

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:19.674
Power went out
         some time ago.

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:23.678
- Steve was right.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:32.520
Why are you stalking me?

01:06:32.522 --> 01:06:36.491
- I'm not stalking you, Jude.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:40.395
<i> What a rude thing to say.</i>

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:45.000
I've been fascinated by you.

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:46.701
Watching you.

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:51.106
Listening to you struggle
        with your music.

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:55.643
<i> What a disappointment you are.</i>

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:57.412
You're good.

01:06:57.414 --> 01:06:59.080
You're not great.

01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:06.021
<i> Emily was great.</i>

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:10.358
<i> And this beautiful</i>
      <i> instrument of yours</i>

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:14.262
I fear might be a little
        bit much for you.

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:17.632
I think it deserves to be
   in a pair of better hands.

01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:26.241
<i> But that'll leave</i>
       <i> me with a problem.</i>

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:28.443
What to do with you.

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:31.312
(eerie music)

01:07:31.314 --> 01:07:35.183
- What do you mean?

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:37.519
<i> Please.</i>

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:44.592
Just put it back, please.
          Put it back.

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:47.162
- It's a very valuable
      instrument, isn't it?

01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:49.665
- Yeah. Yes.

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:52.167
<i> - Do you know how to determine</i>
     <i> the value of a violin?</i>

01:07:52.169 --> 01:07:55.603
Well, I'll tell you.

01:07:55.605 --> 01:08:00.475
There are a few things
        to look out for.

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:03.278
One,

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.547
it's the detail

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:07.649
of the scroll.

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:10.118
You see?

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.122
The other,

01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:17.425
is how refined the edges are.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:22.397
But most importantly, Jude,

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:27.535
the graduation of the
        wood at the back.

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:30.772
But this isn't the original
     bow though, it is? No.

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:34.509
Because the maker's mark
    would be here if it was.

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:36.176
But on the violin,

01:08:36.179 --> 01:08:39.346
the original maker's sticker
   would be inside the violin

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:42.716
and you'd have to look through
  the sounding hole to see it.

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:52.193
(foreboding music)

01:08:52.194 --> 01:09:01.269
I can't make it
       out in this light.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:04.572
You said this
         is a Gagliano.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:08.810
- Yeah, it's my Gagliano.

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:12.247
Remember?

01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:15.250
It was my great
         grandmother's.

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:19.487
- Yeah, it's the Gagliano.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.890
You said it was a

01:09:21.892 --> 01:09:23.658
hundred and...

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.526
- Three.

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:27.462
(ominous music)

01:09:27.464 --> 01:09:32.934
- That's old, isn't it?

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:38.473
(crying)

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:43.678
Trying to find the
        maker's sticker.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.316
Here you go. Now we're talking.

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:51.352
<i> Found the sticker.</i>

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:54.789
Wait.

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:56.624
What?

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:58.660
No, this isn't right. What?

01:09:58.662 --> 01:10:01.863
This isn't supposed
           to happen.

- Detective.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:22.650
Found this little
       guy alive upstairs.

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:24.018
- Great.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.988
Book him.

(train horn)

01:15:33.563 --> 01:15:34.862

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:36.731
Detectives,

01:15:36.733 --> 01:15:38.666
I'm Professor Murphy

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:39.800
from the university.

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:41.936
- Tell us what you
        know about this.

01:15:41.938 --> 01:15:43.571
- All I know is that

01:15:43.573 --> 01:15:46.807
the woman that lives in this
   house is a student of mine

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:49.076
and I came over because she
 left me this frantic voicemail

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:51.646
and I came as
       quickly as I could.

01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:53.247
She kept on, she kept on--

01:15:53.249 --> 01:15:54.949
- Slow down. Settle down.

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:57.818
- She kept on repeating
    that she was on her way,

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.721
that she wouldn't be late for
  our FAC Fellowship try-outs.

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:02.657
- Where are those?

01:16:02.659 --> 01:16:05.326
- They're at
         the university.

01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:07.795
But they aren't for
      another three months.

01:16:07.797 --> 01:16:09.964
And she...

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:13.768
She didn't even qualify.

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:15.670
(eerie music)

01:16:15.672 --> 01:16:17.305
(gasp)

01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:18.973
(tires screeching)

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:20.341
- We need to get
         her back here.

01:16:20.343 --> 01:16:21.659
- Right.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.976
- We need to ask
       you some questions.

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:24.845
- Yes, of course,
            anything.

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:27.214
<i> - [Detective] Was Emily Foster</i>
  <i> a student of yours as well?</i>

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:28.849
<i> - [Murphy] What does Emily</i>
     <i> have to do with this?</i>

01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:31.385
<i> - [Detective] There</i>
      <i> may be a connection.</i>

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:33.920
<i> - [Murphy] Emily and Jude</i>
  <i> were both students of mine.</i>

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:35.506
<i> - [Detective] One</i>
         <i> of the victims</i>

01:16:35.507 --> 01:16:37.090
<i> appears to have been</i>
       <i> Emily's boyfriend.</i>

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.859
<i> - [Murphy] Oh my God,</i>
      <i> that would be David.</i>

01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:41.028
<i> He was a grad student.</i>

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:43.898
<i>When she died, he was convinced</i>
    <i> somebody had killed her.</i>

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.200
<i> - [Detective] And you believe</i>
    <i> that your student, Jude,</i>

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:47.702
<i> was involved?</i>

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.203
<i> - [Murphy] That's</i>
        <i> what people say.</i>

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:51.639
<i> David was convinced she was.</i>

01:16:51.641 --> 01:17:05.252

(car horn)

01:17:08.358 --> 01:17:20.701
- Does every woman I meet
   have to be a fucking whore?

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:22.269
- You need to
        pull it together.

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:28.376
It's time to get a
       hold of your mess.

01:17:28.378 --> 01:17:33.280
(groaning)

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:35.082
- Dave.

01:17:35.084 --> 01:17:49.964
He's cute.

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:51.832
- Ben.

01:17:51.834 --> 01:18:05.212
- If you had
        just been there.

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:12.186
<i> - [Ben] Are you excited?</i>

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:14.121

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:17.324
Yes.

01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:19.026
I'm so happy you're here.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:22.463
- I wouldn't miss it.

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:25.966
Hey.

01:18:25.968 --> 01:18:29.103
You're the gifted one.
