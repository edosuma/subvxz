WEBVTT

00:07.807 --> 00:10.275
The prey's course
has become erratic.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.311
l will intercept to kill.

00:12.379 --> 00:13.311
No.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.439
Maintain distance.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.915
His ship is damaged.

00:17.984 --> 00:19.576
He's injured.

00:19.652 --> 00:21.119
Let him bleed.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.451
This prey is resilient.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.718
We will lose the moment.

00:27.127 --> 00:30.688
The way a creature behaves
when it is wounded

00:30.764 --> 00:33.324
is the key to its destruction.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.561
Maintain distance.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.872
Direct hit.

00:39.939 --> 00:42.032
Our hull armor is stable.

00:42.108 --> 00:44.906
His weapons must be weakening.

00:44.978 --> 00:48.539
The prey is heading
for an asteroid belt.

00:48.615 --> 00:51.516
Vector 168. 9.

00:56.923 --> 00:58.857
We are losing him.

00:58.925 --> 01:02.258
He hasn't come here to hide.

01:02.328 --> 01:06.230
He's come to make a final stand.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.128
Tracking.

01:14.441 --> 01:17.342
He's holding position
above an asteroid

01:17.410 --> 01:19.503
and he's left his ship.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.206
Follow him.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.889 --> 02:06.052
The prey is scattering
our sensors.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.321
lmpressive.

02:08.394 --> 02:12.125
He counters our pursuit
to the final moment.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.790
Compensating.

02:13.867 --> 02:17.303
No. Disengage sensors.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.928
For what reason?

02:19.072 --> 02:22.940
l want to take him
with my own eyes.

02:23.009 --> 02:24.601
Follow.

02:34.554 --> 02:36.613
l'll draw his attack.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.214
Prepare to target
his thoracic crest.

03:31.110 --> 03:33.840
A flawless kill.

05:27.527 --> 05:30.724
"Please remain still so that
l can treat your injuries.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.264
"Thank you.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.527
"l'm sorry. Did that hurt?

05:34.600 --> 05:36.591
"l'll try to be more careful.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.638
"Thanks for being
a patient patient.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.970
Have a pleasant afternoon."
This is absurd.

05:42.041 --> 05:43.303
Not at all.
Keep going.

05:43.376 --> 05:44.468
You're doing fine.

05:44.544 --> 05:45.977
This vernacular
is not applicable

05:46.045 --> 05:47.137
to my duties on Voyager.

05:47.213 --> 05:48.612
We can tailor the vocabulary

05:48.681 --> 05:51.081
to your specific situations
a little later.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.277
Right now, it's the sentiment
that counts.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.150
l don't see the relevance.

05:55.221 --> 05:57.587
l created these exercises
three years ago

05:57.657 --> 06:00.057
to familiarize myself
with the social graces.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.959
l found that if l repeated
them several times each day,

06:03.029 --> 06:05.395
the words became
almost second nature.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.057
Let's continue.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.863
Exercise two:
"The workplace encounter."

06:10.002 --> 06:11.799
Kes used to help me
with this one.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.338
Now l'll be the nurse.
You be the doctor.

06:17.844 --> 06:19.903
"Please hand me the hypospray."

06:19.979 --> 06:21.844
"Of course, Doctor,
immediately."

06:21.914 --> 06:23.814
"Thank you.
Looks at instrument."

06:23.883 --> 06:26.374
No, no. Don't read that part--
only the dialogue.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.251
"Excuse me, Nurse.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.120
"This is the wrong hypospray.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.022
Would you mind finding
the correct one?"

06:34.093 --> 06:35.219
"Not at all."

06:35.294 --> 06:36.261
"Thank you."

06:36.329 --> 06:38.490
"Did l mention you
look lovely today?"

06:38.564 --> 06:39.929
"Oh, Doctor,
you're so charming."

06:40.032 --> 06:42.660
This lesson is terminated.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.605
l know it's awkward.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.105
For me, it was even painful,

06:48.174 --> 06:50.574
but l think you'll find the
rewards well worth the effort.

06:50.643 --> 06:52.110
Rewards.

06:52.178 --> 06:54.738
The ability
to put others at ease...

06:54.814 --> 06:57.374
make them feel
more comfortable around you.

06:57.450 --> 07:00.248
You're a lot like me
when l was first activated.

07:00.319 --> 07:01.513
lf l'd had a mentor,

07:01.587 --> 07:04.351
things would have gone
a lot more smoothly.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.120
l'm willing to share my wisdom,

07:07.193 --> 07:11.095
but, if you're not interested...
fine.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.325
l'll stick to your
physiological maintenance.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.165
l will examine your data.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.760
Oh, good.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.204
Pay special attention
to Exercise 17:

07:21.274 --> 07:22.969
"Bridge banter for beginners."

07:28.648 --> 07:30.843
Have a pleasant day.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.613
Hmm?

07:33.686 --> 07:35.051
Verify.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.315
Monotanium hull plating,

07:36.389 --> 07:38.448
dicyclic warp signature--

07:38.524 --> 07:40.515
the vessel is definitely
Hirogen.

07:40.593 --> 07:41.855
They're moving to intercept.

07:41.928 --> 07:42.917
Evasive maneuvers?

07:43.029 --> 07:45.725
No. We need to settle
our differences here and now.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.231
Hard about, full impulse.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.268
Red Alert.

07:49.335 --> 07:50.859
They're in visual range.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.030
On screen.

07:53.105 --> 07:54.572
Hail them.

07:56.108 --> 07:57.632
No response.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.768
They're closing.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.370
50, 000 kilometers...

08:01.447 --> 08:04.541
forty- five...forty...

08:04.617 --> 08:06.346
Maintain course, Mr. Paris.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.784
Curious.

08:07.854 --> 08:10.152
They are not charging weapons.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.850
They're slowing, sir.

08:11.924 --> 08:12.982
Life signs?

08:13.059 --> 08:14.026
Only one.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.424
And it's erratic.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.292
They've stopped, Captain.

08:17.363 --> 08:19.297
Their engines
just went off- line.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.827
This could be a trap.

08:22.902 --> 08:26.338
Harry, run a long- range scan.

08:26.405 --> 08:28.737
Are there any other
Hirogen ships out there?

08:32.111 --> 08:33.544
None.

08:36.048 --> 08:38.243
Take us
within transporter range.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.581
You intend to board their ship.

08:40.653 --> 08:41.585
Yes.

08:41.654 --> 08:44.521
The Hirogen vessel is
a potential threat.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.387
We should destroy it.

08:46.459 --> 08:50.361
Seven, what you call a threat,
l call an opportunity...

08:50.429 --> 08:52.727
to gain knowledge
about this species--

08:52.798 --> 08:56.097
and in this case,
maybe even show some compassion.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.262
There seems to be
a wounded pilot over there.

08:59.338 --> 09:01.067
Our experience
with the Hirogen indicates

09:01.140 --> 09:03.574
that compassion
would not be reciprocated.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.702
And all of my experience says

09:05.778 --> 09:07.905
we've got to take
that chance anyway.

09:10.182 --> 09:12.446
Commander.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.110
Tuvok, Paris, you're with me.

09:42.648 --> 09:44.343
Looks like there was a fight.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.853
Search for the life signs.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.631
Commander.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.999
l'm reading bones,
muscle tissue...

10:44.076 --> 10:46.010
from at least
nine different species.

10:46.078 --> 10:49.206
lt's all being broken down
by some sort of enzyme.

10:49.281 --> 10:53.047
Perhaps this is their method
of denaturating their prey.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.714
Either that...or it's dinner.

11:22.081 --> 11:24.106
Looks like somebody
lost their helmet.

11:34.927 --> 11:36.451
Commander.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.926
l'm not picking up
any weapon residuals.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.935
l'd say he was
physically torn apart.

11:46.405 --> 11:47.997
l'm picking up the life signs.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.074
This way.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.123
Massive internal bleeding.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.895
Let's get him to Sick Bay.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.736
The data we downloaded
from the ship's computer

12:21.807 --> 12:23.240
included navigational records.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.106
Can you give us a map
of this region?

12:27.913 --> 12:30.143
This is the Hirogen vessel's
flight path

12:30.216 --> 12:31.615
over the past five years.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.278
They've certainly covered
a lot of space.

12:34.353 --> 12:35.342
This ship alone has visited

12:35.421 --> 12:37.548
over 90 star systems
in the last year.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.250
l analyzed some of their logs.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.293
From what l can tell,
this is a hunting species.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.851
We saw the skeletal remains

12:43.929 --> 12:47.092
from dozens of alien races
displayed like trophies.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.258
There was also evidence

12:48.334 --> 12:50.393
they may be using some
of their victims for food.

12:50.469 --> 12:53.529
The entire culture
seems to be based on the hunt--

12:53.606 --> 12:55.904
social rituals, art,
religious beliefs.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.340
They're nomadic.

12:57.409 --> 12:59.536
Their existence is driven
by the pursuit of prey.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.671
And it's carried them
across huge distances.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.806
There is no evidence
of a home planet.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.875
Their ships travel alone
or in small groups.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.113
On occasion,
several will join forces

13:09.188 --> 13:10.587
in a multipronged attack.

13:10.656 --> 13:12.248
Like wolves.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.824
How's our"wolf" in Sick Bay?

13:15.895 --> 13:19.092
Still unconscious...
behind a level- 5 force field.

13:20.699 --> 13:22.564
You were right, Seven.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.193
This species is a threat.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.465
But despite the risk
of sending an away team,

13:26.539 --> 13:29.440
we know a lot more about
who we're dealing with now.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.203
You were correct, Captain.

13:31.277 --> 13:32.904
lt was worth the risk...

13:32.978 --> 13:34.309
this time.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.852
So, there's
one question remaining.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.980
Who's hunting the hunters?

13:59.505 --> 14:01.405
l was trying to remove
his body armor

14:01.507 --> 14:03.407
to treat the internal injuries,

14:03.442 --> 14:05.239
when he suddenly
regained consciousness.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.836
Needless to say,
he's not happy to be here.

14:07.913 --> 14:08.902
Can you sedate him?

14:08.981 --> 14:09.913
l've already tried.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.916
His immune system
neutralizes everything.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.884
l could synthesize
a more potent compound,

14:13.953 --> 14:15.113
but that would take hours.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.449
He could be dead by then.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.989
His wounds are severe.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.826
Your crewmate is dead...

14:22.895 --> 14:26.524
and your ship has been damaged
beyond repair.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.090
l brought you here
to treat your injuries.

14:29.168 --> 14:32.103
What happened to your ship?

14:32.171 --> 14:34.162
Who attacked you?

14:37.109 --> 14:38.542
The first time
l met your species,

14:38.611 --> 14:41.546
it wasn't on the best of terms,
but that doesn't mean you and l

14:41.614 --> 14:44.139
can't find a way to change that.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.444
Our prey.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.951
You were on a hunt.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.885
Yes.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.923
A formidable alien.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.152
We captured it two days ago,

14:54.226 --> 14:55.625
but it broke free

14:55.694 --> 14:58.322
of its restraints...
attacked us.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.796
Release me.

14:59.865 --> 15:02.060
l must continue the hunt.

15:02.167 --> 15:05.534
Not without your ship
and not in this condition.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.539
You'll die without treatment.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.699
Let us help you.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.736
Doctor?

15:19.852 --> 15:21.080
All right...

15:21.153 --> 15:23.314
l'm going to enter
the force field now

15:23.389 --> 15:26.517
and start with a few scans
of your midsection.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.082
You should know l'm a hologram

15:28.160 --> 15:30.492
and can't be bent,
spindled or mutilated

15:30.562 --> 15:32.496
so don't bother trying.

15:32.564 --> 15:35.624
Hmm.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.192
Please lie down.

15:40.973 --> 15:42.998
Or remain standing.

15:46.845 --> 15:49.143
Captain, we've detected
six more Hirogen ships.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.977
They're converging on us
from all directions.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.210
The one in Sick Bay

15:52.284 --> 15:54.650
may have sent a distress call
from his vessel.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.551
How long do we have?

15:56.622 --> 15:58.112
The nearest ship
is half a light- year away--

15:58.190 --> 15:59.157
four hours at most.

16:00.426 --> 16:03.293
Tom, analyze
their approach pattern.

16:03.362 --> 16:04.795
Evade them as long as you can.

16:04.863 --> 16:06.831
Yes, ma'am.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.265
l want to buy the Doctor enough
time to treat our hunter.

16:09.335 --> 16:12.361
lf l can gain his confidence,
he might call off his friends.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.838
Good old- fashioned diplomacy
could get us out of this yet.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.238
Don't count on it.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.707
From what l found
in their database,

16:17.776 --> 16:19.767
diplomacy isn't a part
of their lifestyle.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.176
They don't see us as equals.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.770
To them, we're simply game.

16:22.948 --> 16:24.313
lt's time
we convince them otherwise--

16:24.383 --> 16:27.477
or like any other cornered
animal, we'll show our teeth.

16:27.553 --> 16:31.580
There's been a hull rupture
on Deck 1 1, Section 3.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.181
Damage is minor.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.226
lt appears
a plasma conduit overloaded.

16:35.294 --> 16:38.661
lncrease power to the structural
integrity field.

16:39.798 --> 16:43.131
A bulkhead has collapsed
in Jefferies Tube 84.

16:43.202 --> 16:44.294
Another overload?

16:44.370 --> 16:47.305
Negative.
The plasma network is stable.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.341
This wasn't caused by any
power surge or system failure.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.900
Harry, Tuvok, get to Deck 1 1
and check it out.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.449
This was no overload.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.050
lndeed.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.727
Commander.

17:23.909 --> 17:28.141
lt's a dense mixture of DNA
and polyfluidic compounds.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.578
Tuvok to Bridge.

17:29.648 --> 17:30.444
Go ahead.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.450
We may have
an intruder on board.

17:32.518 --> 17:35.112
l'm analyzing what could be
a sample of its blood.

17:35.187 --> 17:39.180
The readings are consistent
with Species 8472.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.526
lntruder alert.

17:41.593 --> 17:42.525
Bridge to Security.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.289
Seal off Decks 10 through 12.

17:44.363 --> 17:48.094
lnternal sensors
aren't detecting any intruders.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.499
The last time
we ran into this species,

17:50.569 --> 17:52.935
it was impervious
to our scanners.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.597
We'll have to track it visually.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.570
How did it get
past our shields?

17:59.645 --> 18:00.703
We'll worry about that later.

18:00.813 --> 18:01.973
You have the Bridge, Commander.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.208
l'll be on Deck 1 1.

18:07.553 --> 18:10.215
l've erected a level- 10 force
field around Engineering.

18:10.289 --> 18:11.847
Good. Set up
secondary force fields

18:11.924 --> 18:14.154
around every hatch,
Jefferies tube and conduit

18:14.226 --> 18:15.454
leading into this room.

18:15.527 --> 18:18.655
l want every one
of these consoles secured--

18:18.730 --> 18:20.129
authorized command codes only.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.190
l'm going to lock down
the warp core.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.859
Ensign, realign
the dilithium matrix

18:24.002 --> 18:27.631
to a frequency of 3. 69.

18:43.922 --> 18:44.911
Report.

18:44.990 --> 18:47.151
Four crew members are
wounded, two seriously.

18:48.894 --> 18:50.589
Get them to Sick Bay.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.187
Species 8472
accessed Engineering

18:53.265 --> 18:54.926
through the antimatter
injector port.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.798
Our phaser fire
was insufficient.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.930
lt attacked us, then escaped
through Jefferies Tube 17- Alpha.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.803
Janeway to Tuvok.

19:02.875 --> 19:03.807
Tuvok here.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.400
The intruder
just left Engineering.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.569
Seal off the area.

19:06.645 --> 19:07.805
Understood.

19:07.880 --> 19:08.710
Secure the warp core.

19:08.780 --> 19:09.644
Yes, Captain.

19:09.715 --> 19:10.841
Seven.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.389
lt would seem that the Hirogen

19:19.458 --> 19:21.551
underestimated
their latest prey.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.219
You believe they were
hunting the creature.

19:23.295 --> 19:26.355
Yes. When the Borg
were fighting Species 8472,

19:26.431 --> 19:28.126
did they ever engage
in physical combat?

19:28.200 --> 19:29.497
On many occasions.

19:29.568 --> 19:32.867
Can you recall anything
that might help us here?

19:32.971 --> 19:34.836
Each time they boarded
a Borg vessel,

19:34.907 --> 19:36.875
they went directly
to the central power matrix

19:36.975 --> 19:38.203
and disabled it.

19:38.277 --> 19:39.710
The creature was just
in Engineering.

19:39.778 --> 19:41.905
Didn't touch any
of our power systems.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.914
lt's obviously adjusted
its strategy.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.645
Species 8472 is devious
and highly intelligent.

19:47.719 --> 19:50.347
lt will seek the most efficient
means of destroying us.

19:50.422 --> 19:51.650
Let's get to Sick Bay.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.468
She's going to be
just fine, Captain.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.370
ls it alone?

20:09.441 --> 20:11.432
Have you seen
any others like it?

20:11.510 --> 20:12.841
Why?

20:12.911 --> 20:15.072
Six months ago, this species
invaded our galaxy

20:15.147 --> 20:16.239
with thousands of ships.

20:16.315 --> 20:17.714
We were barely able
to fight them off.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.978
Your prey could indicate
another invasion.

20:20.085 --> 20:21.985
lf it does,
we're all in trouble.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.579
How many ships have you seen?

20:24.656 --> 20:27.454
Only one. Damaged.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.757
We tracked it
across 50 light- years.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.763
We thought that we had
killed the creature,

20:32.831 --> 20:35.356
but this prey is
unlike any other.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.265
lt has many lives.

20:37.336 --> 20:41.568
Lower the force field
and l will finish the hunt.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.870
Your attempt to destroy
it will fail.

20:43.942 --> 20:47.434
Species 8472 is highly
resistant to all technology.

20:47.512 --> 20:50.640
All but one...
Borg nanoprobes.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.183
"Nanoprobes"?

20:52.251 --> 20:53.513
Microscopic weapons that can

20:53.585 --> 20:55.712
attack the species
on a cellular level.

20:55.787 --> 20:58.051
We've tried it before
and it worked.

20:58.123 --> 21:01.422
l'll modify the phaser rifles
to fire nanoprobe discharges.

21:01.493 --> 21:03.586
l want you to incapacitate
the creature, not kill it.

21:03.662 --> 21:04.856
Can you make that modification?

21:04.930 --> 21:07.797
Yes, but it would
require additional time.

21:07.866 --> 21:10.027
We must stop it
as soon as possible.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.091
She's right.

21:11.169 --> 21:13.569
Not until we know
why it returned.

21:13.639 --> 21:15.971
You will be exposing this crew
to unnecessary risk.

21:16.041 --> 21:16.973
l disagree.

21:17.042 --> 21:17.974
Captain...

21:18.043 --> 21:20.204
You have your orders, Seven.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.975
Six of your vessels will be here
in under four hours.

21:23.048 --> 21:26.540
l hope you'll let them know
that we saved your life

21:26.618 --> 21:29.485
and that we want to avoid
any further conflict

21:29.554 --> 21:30.816
with your people.

21:30.889 --> 21:34.586
Let me resume the hunt,
and l will grant your request.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.458
We have enough problems
on this ship as it is

21:37.529 --> 21:38.962
without him running around.

21:39.031 --> 21:42.364
l spent six months studying
this prey's behavior.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.095
l know how to track him.

21:44.169 --> 21:49.163
Let me continue or l will have
the others destroy you.

21:51.843 --> 21:52.901
Tuvok to Janeway.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.036
Go ahead.

21:54.112 --> 21:56.342
We're holding position
in Section 94,

21:56.415 --> 21:59.646
but the creature has accessed
the environmental controls.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.913
Deck 1 1 is losing life support.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.650
Artificial gravity has also
been compromised.

22:07.726 --> 22:08.920
Evacuate the deck.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.256
Regroup on Deck 10.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.455
Aye, Captain.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.794
He's trying
to barricade himself.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.423
He did the same thing to us.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.092
You want to be part of the hunt?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.103
Now's your chance.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.264
He'll be under
your supervision, Commander.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.104
lf he steps out of line,
shoot him.

22:40.926 --> 22:42.553
My weapon.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.690
Temperature gradient.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.666
Affirmative.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.600
Atmospheric recyclers.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.695
Engaged.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.707
ls your body armor
designed to handle

22:57.776 --> 22:59.368
rapid pressure fluctuations?

22:59.444 --> 23:03.312
lt can defeat
most hostile environments.

23:03.415 --> 23:06.509
l once tracked
a silicon- based life- form

23:06.551 --> 23:09.918
through the neutronium mantle
of a collapsed star.

23:09.988 --> 23:13.515
l once tracked a mouse
through Jefferies Tube 32.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.860
Chakotay to Tuvok.
We're ready to go.

23:19.931 --> 23:21.694
As are we.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.098
Proceed to Deck 1 1.

23:23.168 --> 23:24.760
Keep your com links open.

23:24.836 --> 23:28.397
Understood.
Activate the nanoprobe charges.

23:28.473 --> 23:31.374
Level five should be sufficient
to stun the creature.

23:43.288 --> 23:45.279
Depressurizing hatch.

23:45.357 --> 23:46.654
Magnetize.

24:51.022 --> 24:53.115
Maintain your position.

24:53.191 --> 24:55.523
He's here.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.892
l said maintain your position.

24:57.963 --> 24:59.396
This is my hunt.

24:59.464 --> 25:00.726
l'm at point.

25:00.832 --> 25:04.063
My knowledge of this prey
is superior to yours.

25:04.102 --> 25:05.501
But you're
on unfamiliar terrain.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.037
l know this ship.

25:07.105 --> 25:08.129
You don't.

25:08.206 --> 25:11.869
The prey will likely attack
the man at point.

25:13.912 --> 25:15.812
You would not survive.

25:15.881 --> 25:18.179
l'll take that chance.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.047
Now, fall back.

25:34.065 --> 25:35.293
No problem.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.198
l'll take up the rear.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.622
You missed.

26:09.768 --> 26:12.669
Since Species 8472
invaded the ship,

26:12.737 --> 26:15.069
you've become
increasingly agitated.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.074
They were the only species

26:17.142 --> 26:19.736
to offer true resistance
to the Borg.

26:19.811 --> 26:22.109
They destroyed
millions of drones,

26:22.180 --> 26:23.909
hundreds of our worlds.

26:24.015 --> 26:27.246
l have reason to be agitated.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.566
What is it?

26:41.633 --> 26:43.328
lt's blood.

26:43.401 --> 26:45.096
The prey is wounded.

26:45.170 --> 26:48.230
This corridor ends
about 20 meters ahead.

26:48.306 --> 26:50.866
The only thing down there
is Deflector Control.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.603
lt's got nowhere to run.

26:52.677 --> 26:54.975
He is not planning to run.

26:55.046 --> 26:56.707
He is waiting.

26:56.781 --> 27:00.376
He'll attempt to slip around us,
attack from behind.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.381
Chakotay to Tuvok.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.683
Tuvok here.

27:04.756 --> 27:07.520
We've cornered the intruder
in Section 59.

27:07.592 --> 27:09.423
On our way.

27:20.705 --> 27:22.070
lt's hurt.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.438
This prey is resilient.

27:24.509 --> 27:27.069
He will strike
with his dying breath.

27:29.781 --> 27:32.079
We must kill him now.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.708
That may not be necessary.

27:35.253 --> 27:36.811
Hold your fire.

27:36.888 --> 27:37.946
l said lower your weapon!

28:13.358 --> 28:15.758
Mr. Neelix, l must ask you

28:15.827 --> 28:18.057
to exchange your spatula
for a phaser rifle.

28:18.129 --> 28:19.357
Sir?

28:19.431 --> 28:20.864
We have
two intruders onboard

28:20.965 --> 28:22.865
and six Hirogen vessels
on the way.

28:22.934 --> 28:24.561
l need additional
security personnel.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.570
Right away, sir.

28:26.638 --> 28:28.606
What's my assignment?

28:28.673 --> 28:31.870
Join the security detail
on Deck 10, Section 12.

28:31.943 --> 28:34.673
You'll receive
further instructions there.

28:34.746 --> 28:35.940
l'll expect tactical updates
every 20 min...

28:41.019 --> 28:42.543
Lieutenant?

28:42.620 --> 28:44.110
Are you all right?

28:44.189 --> 28:46.020
You have your orders.

28:48.593 --> 28:50.686
Report.

28:50.762 --> 28:53.322
The Hirogen's back in Sick Bay
within a force field.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.922
And Species 8472?

28:55.033 --> 28:56.432
We've established
a security perimeter.

28:56.501 --> 28:58.833
Basically, we've turned this
entire section into a brig.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.098
As an added precaution,
have B'Elanna start working

29:01.206 --> 29:02.798
on a way
to lock onto the creature,

29:02.841 --> 29:04.741
in case we have to beam it
off the ship.

29:04.809 --> 29:06.640
You mentioned it was injured.
ln what way?

29:06.711 --> 29:07.837
l wish l could tell you
for certain.

29:07.912 --> 29:10.506
lts body is generating
some sort bioelectric field

29:10.582 --> 29:11.742
making it impossible to scan,

29:11.816 --> 29:14.080
so l could only make
a visual diagnosis.

29:14.152 --> 29:16.211
lt's conscious but immobile.

29:16.287 --> 29:18.414
lts epidermis displays
any number of injuries--

29:18.490 --> 29:20.424
punctures, energy burns--

29:20.492 --> 29:23.723
and its demeanor is that
of a wounded animal.

29:23.795 --> 29:26.093
The Hirogen said they'd been
chasing it for several months.

29:26.164 --> 29:27.188
ls there anything you can do?

29:27.265 --> 29:29.096
l don't know enough
about its physiology

29:29.167 --> 29:30.395
to treat the surface wounds,

29:30.468 --> 29:31.867
let alone any internal damage.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.767
Frankly, l'm at a loss.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.864
Captain, just
before we cornered it,

29:36.975 --> 29:40.911
Species 8472 accessed deflector
control from this panel.

29:40.979 --> 29:43.072
l've analyzed
the transmission protocols.

29:43.148 --> 29:45.912
lt was attempting to open
a singularity into its realm,

29:45.984 --> 29:47.042
but it failed.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.416
lt was trying to get home.

29:49.487 --> 29:51.250
That's what it looks like.

30:01.599 --> 30:03.226
Tuvok?

30:03.301 --> 30:07.761
The creature initiated
telepathic contact with me.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.535
What's it saying?

30:17.348 --> 30:20.943
lts ship was damaged during
the conflict with the Borg.

30:21.019 --> 30:24.887
When the other members
of its species retreated

30:24.956 --> 30:26.685
into fluidic space...

30:26.758 --> 30:28.316
it was left behind.

30:32.564 --> 30:35.829
lt has been trapped in the
Delta Quadrant ever since...

30:35.900 --> 30:38.266
alone...

30:38.336 --> 30:41.203
pursued
by Hirogen hunting parties.

30:41.272 --> 30:45.606
lt has no desire
for further conflict.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.169
lt only wants to return
to its domain.

30:49.247 --> 30:51.807
lt is dying, Captain.

30:59.324 --> 31:02.157
You have nothing
to be afraid of.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.756
We're going to help you
get back to your realm.

31:06.831 --> 31:08.856
Does it understand?

31:08.933 --> 31:10.833
lt does.

31:10.902 --> 31:14.838
lt will take time
to open a singularity,

31:14.906 --> 31:18.842
and we have no way
of treating your injuries,

31:18.910 --> 31:21.708
but if there's anything
you can tell us about your...

31:28.686 --> 31:31.211
lt has lost consciousness.

31:31.289 --> 31:34.156
Our telepathic link
has been severed.

31:44.302 --> 31:46.930
Where is my prey?

31:47.005 --> 31:49.997
Lying at the end of a corridor
on Deck 1 1...

31:50.108 --> 31:52.008
nearly dead thanks to you.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.407
Take me to it.

31:53.478 --> 31:54.445
No.

31:54.512 --> 31:56.639
Take me to it!

31:56.714 --> 31:59.376
ln less than three hours,
your ships will arrive.

31:59.450 --> 32:04.911
By that time, Species 8472
will no longer be on Voyager.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.320
What do you mean?

32:06.357 --> 32:08.587
l'm sending it back
where it came from.

32:08.660 --> 32:14.394
Surrender the creature to me
and you will not be harmed.

32:14.465 --> 32:16.365
This isn't a hunt;
it's a slaughter.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.095
And l'm calling it off
right now.

32:18.169 --> 32:22.902
We will not be denied our prey.

32:22.974 --> 32:26.034
Give us the creature....

32:27.812 --> 32:31.873
or your crew
will take its place.

32:33.551 --> 32:35.075
Tuvok?

32:44.829 --> 32:46.854
Have Seven of Nine
report to my ready room.

32:46.931 --> 32:48.125
You intend to ask her

32:48.199 --> 32:50.292
to open a rift
into 8472's realm.

32:50.368 --> 32:52.393
She's the only one
on board who knows how.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.869
Given her feelings
toward the species,

32:53.938 --> 32:55.371
she may not want to cooperate.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.372
We'll see.

33:01.913 --> 33:04.177
You wish to see me, Captain?

33:04.248 --> 33:08.048
l've made a decision
about Species 8472.

33:08.119 --> 33:10.917
l'm going to return it
to fluidic space.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.356
ln order to do that, l need you
to open a quantum singularity.

33:14.425 --> 33:17.189
l don't believe that is
a prudent course of action.

33:17.261 --> 33:18.523
l realize it may be

33:18.596 --> 33:21.326
difficult for you to help
save this creature's life,

33:21.399 --> 33:24.926
but part of becoming human
is learning to have compassion

33:25.036 --> 33:26.799
for those who are suffering,

33:26.871 --> 33:30.170
even when they're
your bitter enemies.

33:31.009 --> 33:31.976
Why?

33:33.678 --> 33:36.977
l remember
when l was a Lieutenant.

33:37.081 --> 33:39.982
lt was during
a Cardassian border conflict.

33:40.051 --> 33:41.951
My away team was cut off

33:42.020 --> 33:44.420
while we were defending
a Federation outpost.

33:44.489 --> 33:45.820
We'd been exchanging
phaser fire

33:45.890 --> 33:48.757
with a group of Cardassians
for about three days--

33:48.826 --> 33:50.623
a stalemate.

33:52.463 --> 33:57.093
One night, during
a break in the fighting...

33:57.168 --> 34:00.729
we could hear
this low moaning sound

34:00.805 --> 34:02.670
coming from somewhere
in the brush.

34:02.740 --> 34:05.140
We knew that none
of our people were out there,

34:05.209 --> 34:07.074
so it had to be
a wounded Cardassian.

34:07.145 --> 34:09.612
Well, you have to understand--

34:09.679 --> 34:12.342
we'd been killing each other
for weeks on this planet.

34:12.417 --> 34:13.884
lt was brutal.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.379
But our commanding officer
decided...

34:20.425 --> 34:22.416
that we couldn't just sit there

34:22.493 --> 34:24.654
and listen
to that poor man suffer.

34:24.728 --> 34:29.257
So he ordered me
and an Ensign...

34:30.835 --> 34:32.324
to crawl out there

34:32.402 --> 34:34.803
and bring that Cardassian
back to our camp.

34:34.871 --> 34:36.032
l thought he was crazy.

34:36.107 --> 34:38.074
He was risking our lives
for someone

34:38.141 --> 34:40.474
who would have shot us
without hesitation.

34:42.313 --> 34:43.405
But we did it...

34:45.683 --> 34:47.411
and the Cardassian lived.

34:47.485 --> 34:50.283
Three days later,
we secured the outpost.

34:50.353 --> 34:51.685
lt was a major victory.

34:51.755 --> 34:54.589
We were all decorated
by Starfleet Command,

34:54.659 --> 34:57.287
but in retrospect...

34:57.361 --> 34:59.591
the thing l'm most proud of

34:59.664 --> 35:02.565
was the night we saved
that man's life.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.259
Explain.

35:13.344 --> 35:15.812
A single act of compassion

35:15.880 --> 35:19.008
can put you in touch
with your own humanity.

35:19.083 --> 35:23.417
You are trying to justify
your present decision.

35:23.488 --> 35:24.580
No.

35:24.655 --> 35:28.591
l'm trying to help you see
this as an opportunity to grow.

35:28.659 --> 35:31.457
l know you don't want
to do it, Seven,

35:31.529 --> 35:33.793
but l'm telling you
as your Captain

35:33.865 --> 35:36.925
and as your friend,
you won't regret it.

35:38.903 --> 35:40.234
No.

35:40.304 --> 35:42.932
Your decision is
tactically unsound.

35:43.007 --> 35:44.975
We will be surrounded
by Hirogen ships

35:45.042 --> 35:46.441
in approximately two hours.

35:46.511 --> 35:47.944
lf we do not surrender
the creature,

35:48.045 --> 35:50.172
they will destroy us.

35:50.248 --> 35:52.944
A lesson in compassion
will do me little good

35:53.017 --> 35:54.143
if l am dead.

35:54.218 --> 35:57.312
lt is wrong to sacrifice
another being

35:57.388 --> 35:59.151
to save our own lives.

35:59.223 --> 36:00.884
l have observed that
you have been willing

36:00.992 --> 36:03.426
to sacrifice your own life
to save the lives of your crew.

36:03.461 --> 36:04.860
Yes, but that's different.

36:04.929 --> 36:05.987
That was my choice.

36:06.063 --> 36:08.361
This creature
does not have a choice.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.691
lt invaded our ship,

36:11.769 --> 36:13.862
put our lives at risk
to save its own.

36:13.971 --> 36:17.304
ln my view, it has already
forfeited its freedom.

36:18.309 --> 36:19.799
l'm giving you an order.

36:19.877 --> 36:21.174
Report to Deflector Control

36:21.245 --> 36:23.873
and begin working
on creating a singularity.

36:23.948 --> 36:26.075
l will not comply.

36:27.318 --> 36:29.377
l have agreed
to remain on Voyager.

36:29.453 --> 36:32.547
l have agreed to function
as a member of your crew,

36:32.623 --> 36:34.250
but l will not be a willing

36:34.325 --> 36:36.225
participant
in my own destruction

36:36.294 --> 36:38.387
or the destruction of this ship.

36:39.597 --> 36:41.224
Objection noted.

36:41.299 --> 36:42.493
We'll do this without you.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.034
You will fail.

36:45.102 --> 36:47.730
And you have just
crossed the line.

36:47.805 --> 36:48.772
End of debate.

36:48.839 --> 36:49.897
Report to the cargo bay

36:49.974 --> 36:51.771
and remain there
until this is over.

36:51.842 --> 36:53.969
ls that understood?

37:13.264 --> 37:15.129
Shields down to 84 percent.

37:15.199 --> 37:16.257
Return fire.

37:16.334 --> 37:19.792
Three more ships are closing
from port and starboard.

37:19.870 --> 37:21.701
All escape trajectories
have been cut off.

37:21.772 --> 37:24.468
Our weapons are having little
effect on their hull plating.

37:24.542 --> 37:27.306
l'm scanning for weaknesses
in the molecular structure.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.216
Shields at 79 percent.

37:36.287 --> 37:37.219
They are hailing us.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.153
Better late than never.

37:39.223 --> 37:42.249
Open a channel.

37:42.326 --> 37:44.920
You've taken our prey
and one of our hunters.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.725
Surrender them.

37:46.797 --> 37:49.891
Call off your attack
and we'll return your crewman.

37:49.967 --> 37:53.425
As for your prey,
it's under our protection now.

37:53.504 --> 37:55.165
lt belongs to us.

37:55.239 --> 37:57.673
lt belongs to no one.

37:57.742 --> 37:59.266
Now, order your ships
to withdraw

37:59.343 --> 38:00.708
and this can end peacefully.

38:04.515 --> 38:06.449
All vessels are firing.

38:06.517 --> 38:08.508
Any luck finding
a crack in their armor?

38:08.586 --> 38:09.553
Not yet.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.626
Doctor to Bridge.

38:18.696 --> 38:21.494
Species 8472
appears to be regenerating.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.399
l'm no exobiologist,

38:24.468 --> 38:27.232
but l'd say this fellow
is becoming highly agitated.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.432
lt could be sensing
the Hirogen attack.

38:29.507 --> 38:30.997
Doctor, can you sedate it?

38:31.075 --> 38:32.042
l believe so,

38:32.109 --> 38:34.134
but l'll need another dose
of Borg nanoprobes.

38:34.211 --> 38:36.645
Stand by.

38:36.714 --> 38:38.113
Bridge to Seven of Nine.

38:38.182 --> 38:39.774
Yes.

38:39.850 --> 38:43.115
Report to Deck 1 1 immediately
with a supply of nanoprobes.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.552
Understood.

38:49.593 --> 38:51.151
B'Elanna, how's it going
down there?

38:51.228 --> 38:52.695
Transporters are ready.

38:52.763 --> 38:55.061
l can establish a lock
on the creature at any time,

38:55.132 --> 38:57.657
but l still haven't duplicated
the deflector protocols

38:57.735 --> 38:59.293
to open a singularity.

38:59.370 --> 39:00.132
How long?

39:00.237 --> 39:03.695
l need another hour...
maybe two.

39:03.741 --> 39:05.800
Captain, we can outmaneuver
the Hirogen ships

39:05.876 --> 39:07.844
for a few more minutes,
but beyond that...

39:07.912 --> 39:10.506
Direct hit
to the EPS manifold!

39:10.581 --> 39:11.513
Main power just went down!

39:11.582 --> 39:14.176
Force fields on all decks
are off- line.

39:14.251 --> 39:15.650
Switch to auxiliary power.

39:16.821 --> 39:17.981
Done. Force fields
have been restored,

39:18.055 --> 39:20.489
but l don't know
how long they'll hold.

39:20.558 --> 39:22.856
Bridge to Doctor.
Report.

39:22.927 --> 39:24.121
lt's all right, Captain.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.492
The creature is contained.

39:25.563 --> 39:26.860
Bridge to Sick Bay.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.759
Security respond.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.836
Security, dispatch teams
to Deck 5.

39:40.911 --> 39:43.175
The Hirogen may be loose.

39:43.247 --> 39:45.943
Direct hit
to our port nacelle.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.879
Now, they've taken out
our starboard nacelle.

39:49.954 --> 39:50.921
They've crippled us.

39:50.988 --> 39:53.252
Tuvok, divert warp power
to the phaser banks.

39:53.324 --> 39:55.952
Maybe that'll help us
penetrate their hull plating.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.032
The nanoprobes?

40:02.099 --> 40:03.031
Armed and ready.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.897
Not a moment too soon.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.034
Give me the prey.

40:13.110 --> 40:16.602
Lower your weapon
or l will destroy you.

40:19.517 --> 40:21.610
l don't think you will.

40:21.685 --> 40:24.347
You want me to destroy
this creature.

40:24.422 --> 40:28.586
l saw it on your face
earlier in the medical bay.

40:28.659 --> 40:31.253
lt's a look l've seen
a thousand times.

40:31.328 --> 40:34.764
Stand aside.

40:53.017 --> 40:54.644
What are you doing?

40:56.120 --> 40:58.645
Captain, someone's accessing
the transporter system

40:58.722 --> 40:59.654
from Deck 5.

40:59.723 --> 41:00.587
Lock them out.

41:00.691 --> 41:01.555
l can't.

41:01.592 --> 41:03.025
They're overriding
my commands...

41:03.093 --> 41:05.152
with Borg encryption codes.

41:17.341 --> 41:18.933
Report, Mr. Kim.

41:19.009 --> 41:20.977
8472 and the Hirogen...

41:21.045 --> 41:22.979
they've been beamed to one
of the attacking ships.

41:23.047 --> 41:25.641
All six vessels are moving away
at high warp.

41:25.716 --> 41:27.650
Tom, can we pursue?

41:28.953 --> 41:30.318
l'm sorry, Captain.

41:30.387 --> 41:32.150
Warp engines are still off- line.

41:34.058 --> 41:36.458
Resume our previous course.

41:36.527 --> 41:37.687
Full impulse.

41:41.765 --> 41:43.255
Seven of Nine?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.165
Seven of Nine.

41:49.940 --> 41:54.673
Captain's Log, Stardate 51652. 3.

41:54.745 --> 41:55.973
lt's been 12 hours

41:56.046 --> 41:58.981
and our sensors show no sign
of any Hirogen vessels,

41:59.049 --> 42:01.415
but their people are scattered
throughout this region

42:01.519 --> 42:02.713
and something tells me

42:02.753 --> 42:05.085
that the"hunt" for Voyager
is far from over.

42:41.859 --> 42:42.917
Captain.

42:42.993 --> 42:44.517
Step down, please.

42:49.199 --> 42:52.430
Seven, you disobeyed
my direct orders

42:52.503 --> 42:54.300
and as a result,

42:54.371 --> 42:56.999
you condemned a sentient
being to its death.

42:57.107 --> 43:00.270
By doing so, l also diverted
the Hirogen attack,

43:00.344 --> 43:01.868
an attack which
would have destroyed us.

43:01.979 --> 43:02.968
Maybe not.

43:03.047 --> 43:05.743
ln any case, the decision
wasn't yours to make.

43:05.816 --> 43:07.647
The creature broke
through the force field.

43:07.718 --> 43:08.650
l had no choice.

43:08.719 --> 43:10.812
l didn't come here
to debate your decision.

43:10.888 --> 43:13.516
l came here to inform you
of the consequences.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.923
When you first came to Voyager,

43:16.026 --> 43:17.823
l decided to grant you
the same liberties

43:17.895 --> 43:19.795
and freedoms of any crew member

43:19.863 --> 43:22.423
because l wanted you to
be a part of this family.

43:22.499 --> 43:25.935
And l've been willing
to accommodate your...

43:26.003 --> 43:28.062
unique way of doing things--

43:28.138 --> 43:30.606
even when you rubbed
somebody the wrong way

43:30.674 --> 43:32.232
or violated protocol.

43:32.309 --> 43:34.937
But this time,
l can't accommodate you.

43:35.012 --> 43:39.472
From this point forward, you
will no longer have access

43:39.550 --> 43:42.212
to any primary systems
on this ship--

43:42.286 --> 43:44.880
not without my direct
authorization.

43:44.955 --> 43:48.982
lf you attempt to circumvent me,
l'll throw you in the brig.

43:49.093 --> 43:50.355
l still need your expertise

43:50.427 --> 43:52.395
in the Astrometrics Lab
if you're willing.

43:52.463 --> 43:55.398
lf not, you can spend your time
here in the cargo bay.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.366
ls that understood?

43:59.236 --> 44:00.601
Yes.

44:04.274 --> 44:06.242
lt is puzzling.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.334
What's that?

44:09.046 --> 44:11.537
You made me into an individual.

44:11.615 --> 44:13.480
You encouraged me
to stop thinking

44:13.550 --> 44:15.279
like a member of the collective,

44:15.352 --> 44:19.220
to cultivate my independence
and my humanity.

44:19.289 --> 44:22.690
But when l try to assert that
independence, l am punished.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.820
lndividuality has its limits...

44:25.896 --> 44:29.332
especially on a starship where
there's a command structure.

44:33.137 --> 44:34.934
l believe
that you are punishing me

44:35.072 --> 44:37.438
because l do not think
the way that you do,

44:37.508 --> 44:41.740
because l am not becoming
more like you.

44:41.812 --> 44:43.973
You claim to respect
my individuality,

44:44.081 --> 44:47.573
but in fact,
you are frightened by it.

44:49.787 --> 44:51.812
As you were.
