00:07.905 --> 00:10.116
***

00:10.994 --> 00:13.827
Immediate attraction
is pure narcissism.

00:13.828 --> 00:15.492
Oh, I don't agree.

00:16.106 --> 00:19.255
Look, they're talking
about his t-shirt.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.653
It takes quite a lot of
effort to attract a mate.

00:21.687 --> 00:23.852
That right there is the
beginning of true love.

00:24.334 --> 00:27.282
People are attracted to people
who are attracted to them.

00:36.043 --> 00:37.773
Well, there goes that theory.

00:46.535 --> 00:47.909
Something tells me

00:47.910 --> 00:50.230
we're not getting in much of a run.

00:50.265 --> 00:51.983
Rizzoli. Isles.

00:56.527 --> 00:57.525
Hey, Russ. What do we got?

00:57.559 --> 00:58.524
Hey, Rizzoli. How you doing?

00:58.558 --> 00:59.523
Got a floater.

00:59.557 --> 01:01.355
When did you pull him out?

01:01.389 --> 01:02.487
20 minutes ago.

01:02.522 --> 01:03.986
How long's he been in?

01:04.019 --> 01:05.251
Well, it's hard to tell

01:05.286 --> 01:06.584
once the body's been in the
water for over an hour.

01:06.619 --> 01:08.516
Couldn't find an I.D.

01:18.709 --> 01:20.473
We don't need an I.D.

01:22.506 --> 01:25.568
Maura... you know him?

01:27.301 --> 01:28.899
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.431
It's Adam Fairfield.

01:31.465 --> 01:35.094
I was, uh, I was involved
with his brother Garrett.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.160
Of the Fairfields?

01:37.727 --> 01:40.190
Was it serious?

01:40.225 --> 01:41.556
I was 20.

01:41.591 --> 01:43.155
Everything felt serious.

01:45.653 --> 01:47.984
Look at the back of his head.

01:48.657 --> 01:51.615
Yeah, it's common
with drowning victims.

01:52.169 --> 01:55.145
Most likely from getting
struck against the rocks.

01:57.587 --> 02:00.118
You want to go with me
when I notify the family?

02:02.465 --> 02:03.756
No.

02:04.638 --> 02:06.070
But I will.

02:06.104 --> 02:07.968
I owe him that.

02:31.085 --> 02:33.481
Holy crap.

02:33.515 --> 02:34.680
Well...

02:36.280 --> 02:39.743
The castle in Scotland
is much bigger.

02:39.777 --> 02:41.241
Place on the cape
is beautiful, too.

02:41.276 --> 02:43.606
You could've been a Fairfield.

02:43.641 --> 02:44.872
How do we not know this?

02:44.907 --> 02:46.237
Could you stop saying that?

02:46.272 --> 02:47.603
Whoo-whoo!

02:47.638 --> 02:49.402
This is a spyker!

02:49.905 --> 02:51.884
C8 laviolette.

02:51.885 --> 02:54.688
That's 400 horses up under there.

02:55.219 --> 02:57.287
I've only seen these in magazines.

02:57.288 --> 03:00.226
Garrett's here. He's always
liked the finer things in life.

03:00.261 --> 03:02.658
Yeah. He liked you.

03:10.986 --> 03:12.051
I should have known.

03:12.085 --> 03:14.450
Somebody like the
mayor beat us to it.

03:14.451 --> 03:16.953
Nothing happens in Boston
without the Brahmin families

03:16.954 --> 03:17.968
knowing about it.

03:17.969 --> 03:19.611
Right. Brahmins.

03:19.645 --> 03:21.909
Upper...Crust.

03:23.983 --> 03:26.172
Is that the manifest
from the mayflower?

03:29.737 --> 03:32.734
Look... balthazar Fairfield.

03:32.768 --> 03:34.133
Is that him?

03:34.167 --> 03:36.197
Made his money like all
the first families.

03:36.232 --> 03:37.664
Right, from shipping?

03:37.698 --> 03:41.660
Yeah... rum, wine, slaves.

03:46.624 --> 03:49.687
They don't seem to remember
that part of their history.

03:49.721 --> 03:52.951
The Brahmins have been Boston's
social elite for centuries.

03:52.985 --> 03:54.384
They live conservatively.

03:54.418 --> 03:57.648
It would be considered
dÃ©classÃ© to flaunt your wealth.

03:57.682 --> 03:58.946
This isn't flaunting?

03:58.980 --> 04:01.744
Well, considering that
they're billionaires, no.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.607
Sumner.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.571
Maura.

04:09.605 --> 04:11.436
I'm so sorry.

04:14.568 --> 04:16.632
I hear you're running the
medical examiner's office now.

04:17.666 --> 04:21.161
This is, uh, Jocelyn, Adam's wife.

04:21.196 --> 04:23.194
I'm so sorry about Adam.

04:24.526 --> 04:26.857
At least he was
doing what he loved.

04:27.379 --> 04:29.486
Uh, what was that?

04:29.487 --> 04:31.313
Sailing.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.318
I-I can't believe he drowned.

04:33.353 --> 04:35.150
We can't be sure
that's what happened.

04:36.883 --> 04:38.700
We're gonna need a
description of the boat.

04:38.701 --> 04:39.833
I think we should notify

04:39.834 --> 04:41.389
the Boston harbor
and the coast guard.

04:41.390 --> 04:42.611
Who are you?

04:43.162 --> 04:44.615
Jane, can this wait?

04:45.485 --> 04:47.082
No.

04:47.883 --> 04:49.379
I'm Detective Rizzoli.

04:49.380 --> 04:51.569
This is Detective Frost,
Boston homicide.

04:52.316 --> 04:53.530
Homicide? Why?

04:53.531 --> 04:55.810
We look into all unattended deaths.

05:00.374 --> 05:02.638
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

05:04.004 --> 05:05.835
They're just being thorough.

05:05.869 --> 05:07.600
Last night.

05:08.159 --> 05:10.231
He left very early.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.296
Do you know if he was
wearing a life jacket?

05:12.330 --> 05:13.961
Never.

05:13.996 --> 05:16.859
He said he could sail
before he could ride a bike.

05:18.859 --> 05:20.589
Maura.

05:23.055 --> 05:24.120
Garrett.

05:26.086 --> 05:28.050
I'm so sorry.

05:28.085 --> 05:29.482
Thank you for coming.

05:31.049 --> 05:32.313
Detectives...

05:32.951 --> 05:34.109
I'm Robert Colburn,

05:34.110 --> 05:35.677
legal counsel for the
Fairfield estate.

05:35.712 --> 05:37.610
Thank you for coming so quickly.

05:37.644 --> 05:38.975
Of course.

05:39.009 --> 05:41.140
The family would like to
cooperate in any way they can.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.972
Get me any questions
you have in writing,

05:43.006 --> 05:44.670
and I will respond
to them in 24 hours.

05:44.705 --> 05:46.649
That's not really how we operate.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.001
Well, I'm sure you can
understand that the family is...

05:48.035 --> 05:49.300
Excuse me.

05:49.335 --> 05:52.398
I flew in for the foundation gala.

05:52.432 --> 05:54.662
I can't believe it's
gonna be a memorial now.

05:54.697 --> 05:56.495
Maura. This must be Garrett.

05:56.529 --> 05:57.627
I'm sorry, Mr. Fairfield.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.425
I was explaining to
the detectives...

05:59.459 --> 06:01.502
that it's critical
we get statements

06:01.503 --> 06:02.399
as quickly as possible.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.620
Isn't that right, Maura?

06:04.027 --> 06:05.354
Well, I'm sure the family
will be more than happy

06:05.389 --> 06:07.918
to answer all of your questions
as soon as they're ready.

06:09.319 --> 06:10.750
I don't even have a cause of death.

06:11.484 --> 06:13.581
We should just give
them their space.

06:20.743 --> 06:23.439
Space? How much space do they need?

06:23.474 --> 06:26.571
Yeah, maybe we can, uh,
set up some interviews

06:26.605 --> 06:28.303
over the next few days.

06:28.336 --> 06:30.533
Oh, hey! Do you not get it?

06:30.568 --> 06:31.659
They're not setting up interviews.

06:31.660 --> 06:32.932
Quit looking at the car!

06:32.966 --> 06:34.964
Whoa, hey, whoa. That's not a car.

06:34.997 --> 06:36.196
That's a work of art.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.428
Yeah, you're a tool.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.524
Do you get tired in the afternoon?

06:43.491 --> 06:46.787
Forget where your keys are,
your phone?

06:46.822 --> 06:48.453
Well, polynesian people

06:48.487 --> 06:52.450
are among the healthiest and
happiest people on the planet.

06:52.484 --> 06:54.781
Now science knows why.

06:54.816 --> 06:57.412
And it comes in a bottle.

06:57.447 --> 06:58.528
How long has this been going on?

06:58.529 --> 07:00.077
A while.

07:00.111 --> 07:01.942
I got the two-bottle special. Oh.

07:01.976 --> 07:04.074
Your mother's really
a good saleswoman.

07:04.108 --> 07:05.373
Oh.

07:05.407 --> 07:08.837
If you buy now, I'm offering
a two-for-one special.

07:08.870 --> 07:11.002
It's an excellent value.

07:11.542 --> 07:13.218
And if you sign up for a year,

07:13.219 --> 07:15.198
it's... it's less than
a daily cappuccino.

07:15.232 --> 07:17.229
Come here, ma. Come on.

07:17.264 --> 07:21.160
Excuse me one second. My son.

07:22.094 --> 07:23.991
What? What are you doing?

07:24.025 --> 07:27.089
I'm the authorized sales associate

07:27.123 --> 07:30.619
for the polynesian anti-aging
lychee fruit flush.

07:31.586 --> 07:33.983
Did you know that polynesians
were among the healthiest...

07:34.017 --> 07:35.349
since when are you doing this?

07:35.383 --> 07:39.012
Since it single-handedly cured
Carla Talucci's colitis.

07:39.047 --> 07:40.512
Carla Talucci? Yeah.

07:40.545 --> 07:42.010
The only woman in the neighborhood

07:42.045 --> 07:43.908
who actually fell for
the Nigerian bank scam?

07:43.942 --> 07:46.673
Take a bottle on me.

07:46.707 --> 07:49.504
Take it three times
a day with meals.

07:49.538 --> 07:50.970
It'll change your life.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.402
Do you have to do this here, ma?

07:52.436 --> 07:54.192
The people here will be astonished

07:54.193 --> 07:56.268
at the change in their lives...

07:56.269 --> 07:58.541
digestion, bowel movements...

07:58.542 --> 08:00.762
Ma! What?

08:03.594 --> 08:05.458
Just bring this to Jane.

08:05.493 --> 08:09.955
Maybe it will help both of
you with your irritability.

08:09.988 --> 08:11.953
The body of Adam
Fairfield was found

08:11.987 --> 08:14.318
floating early this
morning in Boston harbor.

08:14.352 --> 08:16.421
Now, Fairfield was
only 42 years old,

08:16.422 --> 08:19.153
but he was the head of
the Fairfield empire,

08:19.154 --> 08:21.955
a collection of
Boston-based corporations,

08:21.956 --> 08:24.106
financial institutions,
philanthropic groups,

08:24.107 --> 08:25.232
things like that.

08:25.233 --> 08:27.240
He was also, though, a member
of one of the oldest, most...

08:27.716 --> 08:29.839
Why are you doing the
autopsy on a Sunday?

08:29.840 --> 08:30.837
Did they cancel

08:30.838 --> 08:35.067
all the kundalini-pulao-riku
yoga classes?

08:35.102 --> 08:37.991
Kundalini is sacred energy work,

08:37.993 --> 08:39.530
pulao is a savory rice dish,

08:39.565 --> 08:42.428
and I'm pretty sure that
you made up that last word.

08:42.462 --> 08:44.159
Well, I'm sorry I'm
not as educated as you

08:44.195 --> 08:45.226
and your deluxe friends.

08:45.261 --> 08:46.992
Thanks for the support with them,
by the way.

08:47.545 --> 08:48.980
Their brother just died.

08:48.981 --> 08:50.241
I'm sorry I couldn't stand there

08:50.242 --> 08:51.654
and just let you badger his family.

08:52.269 --> 08:53.657
Badger?

08:54.320 --> 08:56.117
Is that how you describe
how I do my job?

08:57.051 --> 08:58.849
And since when do you
rush the science?

08:58.882 --> 09:00.408
I'm not rushing anything.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.312
You're scrambling to
finish out the autopsy.

09:02.347 --> 09:03.411
The governor called.

09:03.446 --> 09:04.777
He would like the
reports right away.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.976
Of course he did.
Did you have a nice chat?

09:07.010 --> 09:09.640
Maybe tonight you could attend
the opera with some senators,

09:09.674 --> 09:11.353
and then afterwards
go out on the veranda

09:11.354 --> 09:13.470
and smoke big rolled-up
wads of $100s.

09:13.504 --> 09:15.436
These people are not the enemy.

09:15.470 --> 09:16.968
Yeah, neither was Columbus.

09:17.002 --> 09:19.299
Tell that to the native Americans
he killed with smallpox.

09:19.334 --> 09:21.031
The Fairfields helped
build this city.

09:21.066 --> 09:22.730
My grandfather was an ironworker.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.028
He helped build this city.

09:26.428 --> 09:28.592
Okay, so... So what are
we arguing about here,

09:28.626 --> 09:31.256
history or are you just mad
at me for who my friends are?

09:31.290 --> 09:33.454
This is about work. Okay?

09:33.488 --> 09:35.886
I-I've just never seen you
hugging suspects before.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.651
We don't even know
what happened here.

09:37.686 --> 09:39.573
If this was an accidental drowning,

09:39.574 --> 09:40.949
there are no suspects.

09:40.983 --> 09:43.047
So you're hoping it's an accident.

09:43.081 --> 09:45.378
Are you hoping it was a murder?

09:45.413 --> 09:47.743
I'm doing my job like I always do.

09:47.777 --> 09:50.007
Why don't you do yours? I am.

09:50.042 --> 09:51.378
And as a medical examiner,

09:51.379 --> 09:54.371
it is my job to determine the
cause and the manner of death,

09:54.406 --> 09:56.969
so I'll tell you whether
there's a case here or not.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.165
Maybe I'll just figure
it out for myself.

10:14.987 --> 10:17.351
This is great.

10:17.386 --> 10:18.369
What?

10:18.370 --> 10:21.897
Our suspects. Never seen
so many rich, white faces.

10:21.898 --> 10:26.753
It's "clue"... Jocelyn Fairfield
in the parlor with a knife.

10:28.527 --> 10:31.256
Their money goes back
to Plymouth rock.

10:31.257 --> 10:34.146
Oh, they made plenty of enemies
in the last four centuries.

10:34.147 --> 10:35.512
Check this out.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.484
The tabloids say Adam
Fairfield's marriage

10:39.485 --> 10:40.653
was on the rocks.

10:41.009 --> 10:42.463
What about his brothers,
Sumner and Garrett?

10:42.464 --> 10:43.960
The victim was the oldest brother.

10:43.994 --> 10:45.926
You know, Dr. Isles dated
the middle brother.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.192
No kidding.

10:47.844 --> 10:49.578
Makes sense, I guess.

10:51.522 --> 10:55.051
These people think they're royalty.

10:55.086 --> 10:57.683
But look, even though
Adam was the oldest,

10:57.717 --> 11:00.014
Sumner, the youngest,
took over the family firm.

11:00.048 --> 11:01.779
Maybe Adam was a screwup.

11:01.814 --> 11:02.945
Not for long.

11:02.979 --> 11:05.510
He took over the
business five years ago.

11:05.544 --> 11:08.841
What about Garrett,
the middle brother?

11:08.874 --> 11:12.138
He owns a successful
clothing company in Milan.

11:15.003 --> 11:16.501
Look at this...

11:16.536 --> 11:18.332
Fraud allegations against Sumner.

11:18.367 --> 11:20.131
That's why Adam took over.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.296
"Sumner Fairfield now
finds fulfillment

11:22.330 --> 11:24.362
with hands-on work
at a food pantry."

11:24.396 --> 11:26.900
No one comfortable in a mansion
the size of my neighborhood

11:26.901 --> 11:28.691
chooses to do hands-on
work of any kind.

11:28.726 --> 11:30.490
Let's go talk to him.

11:30.525 --> 11:31.855
When'd you last talk
to harbor patrol?

11:32.395 --> 11:34.327
Two minutes ago.
You were right here listening.

11:34.812 --> 11:36.118
You tell them to find Adam's boat?

11:36.153 --> 11:38.483
No, I left that part out.

11:50.475 --> 11:52.577
I ran the company for six years

11:52.578 --> 11:55.237
while Adam partied
and raced yachts.

11:55.271 --> 11:57.142
Story is he came back and took over

11:57.143 --> 11:58.734
because of fraud allegations?

12:00.700 --> 12:02.331
You really don't know how
the game is played, do you?

12:02.365 --> 12:04.715
No, I never played
the entitlement game.

12:04.716 --> 12:06.355
I played the south Boston game,

12:06.356 --> 12:08.918
on asphalt with broken bottles,
used needles.

12:08.919 --> 12:10.265
Educate me.

12:11.724 --> 12:14.521
Adam got sick of clubbing,
so I gave him a job.

12:14.555 --> 12:17.352
Next thing I know,
the board's accusing me of fraud,

12:17.387 --> 12:18.585
and he's C.E.O.

12:18.619 --> 12:20.695
Why didn't the business go
to him in the first place?

12:20.696 --> 12:21.973
I mean, he was the oldest.

12:21.974 --> 12:23.913
He and my dad fought a lot.

12:23.948 --> 12:25.846
He waited until dad
was dead before...

12:25.880 --> 12:27.895
Before what? Setting you up?

12:27.896 --> 12:29.274
Yeah, he set me up. Guys, Tim!

12:29.275 --> 12:31.285
No, these go to the
Westerville pantry!

12:31.576 --> 12:33.007
How bad did you want
to even things up?

12:36.033 --> 12:39.534
Fairfields will do a lot of
things to each other, Detective,

12:39.569 --> 12:41.233
but brothers don't kill brothers.

12:41.267 --> 12:42.765
Yeah.

12:42.799 --> 12:44.497
Where were you Saturday afternoon?

12:44.531 --> 12:47.295
Motorcycle ride.
Beacon Hill to New Bedford.

12:47.774 --> 12:48.731
Beautiful day.

12:48.732 --> 12:50.659
You guys want to see
the gas receipts?

12:50.693 --> 12:52.991
Anyone go with you? No.
I ride alone.

12:53.025 --> 12:54.789
Come on... Westerville pantry.

12:54.824 --> 12:55.788
Wrong palette!

12:56.922 --> 12:58.853
You guys are way off. It wasn't me.

12:58.886 --> 13:00.651
Adam was an experienced sailor.

13:00.685 --> 13:02.882
So he didn't just
fall off the boat.

13:02.917 --> 13:05.014
Well, what do you think?

13:05.048 --> 13:07.113
Tom!

13:08.143 --> 13:10.954
I think I'd like to see a
picture of Sumner on his bike.

13:16.699 --> 13:18.472
Cashmere.

13:18.473 --> 13:20.429
What will this set me back,
couple hundred?

13:21.699 --> 13:24.695
Well, those are
from Garrett's line.

13:24.696 --> 13:28.525
The sweaters start around,
oh, $1,000.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.957
What's it made of, spun platinum?

13:30.991 --> 13:33.521
The downy undercoat
of cashmere goats.

13:36.943 --> 13:39.150
This texture should be softer.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.515
Must be from the sea-salt exposure.

13:41.550 --> 13:43.380
Or maybe the goat was getting even.

13:49.743 --> 13:52.740
That depression on the bone,
what's that from?

13:52.773 --> 13:54.272
Oh, it's hard to tell.

13:55.838 --> 13:57.336
Maybe the victim fell

13:57.370 --> 13:59.401
and hit his head on
the edge of the boat.

13:59.435 --> 14:02.998
Hey, doc...

14:03.032 --> 14:05.196
you want to tell me why I'm
really here on Jane's case?

14:05.230 --> 14:07.760
Oh, well, I-I thought I
could get the benefit

14:07.795 --> 14:09.293
of your sailing experience.

14:09.328 --> 14:12.158
I got a little sunfish I throw
in the back of the truck

14:12.192 --> 14:13.523
and take out to the cape.

14:13.557 --> 14:16.087
Well, you know, it -
it seems like the victim, you know,

14:16.121 --> 14:18.552
hit his head on the boat,
maybe slipped, fell overboard.

14:18.586 --> 14:19.885
W-what's your take?

14:20.519 --> 14:22.948
My take is that you are the
chief medical examiner,

14:22.983 --> 14:25.116
and this is not your first floater.

14:25.117 --> 14:27.911
It... it is my, uh, my 43rd.

14:27.945 --> 14:29.677
Yes, my... my 43rd.

14:29.711 --> 14:32.061
I've been a cop a long time.

14:32.628 --> 14:35.239
I know when people aren't
telling me the whole story.

14:38.071 --> 14:39.102
Jane's mad at me.

14:39.137 --> 14:40.101
Oh, boy.

14:40.136 --> 14:42.100
She thinks I'm being biased

14:42.135 --> 14:44.531
because I'm acquainted
with the family.

14:44.565 --> 14:46.163
"Acquainted"?

14:46.197 --> 14:47.429
I heard it was a
little more than that.

14:47.463 --> 14:49.661
It was.

14:49.695 --> 14:51.038
That's not it, though.

14:51.315 --> 14:53.292
When you grew up like Jane,
you're gonna have an attitude

14:53.325 --> 14:56.255
about people who, uh,
who are entitled.

14:56.290 --> 14:57.488
That's a form of prejudice.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.353
Where people like me
and Jane come from,

14:59.388 --> 15:01.151
we didn't have a lot.

15:01.185 --> 15:02.816
But we had each other's backs.

15:04.350 --> 15:05.707
Sounds to me like all
Jane wants to know is,

15:05.708 --> 15:07.580
do you have hers or not?

15:15.341 --> 15:18.005
Hey. So ma's got a new job.

15:18.039 --> 15:19.137
Selling that.

15:22.813 --> 15:24.273
Carla Talucci?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.397
Can you have the crime
lab run a test on it?

15:28.265 --> 15:30.495
I just want to make sure
she's not gonna kill anybody.

15:30.528 --> 15:32.192
Yeah, sure.

15:35.277 --> 15:36.881
What's up?

15:37.723 --> 15:40.074
Ma's wearing lipstick every day.

15:40.075 --> 15:41.788
She just bought some new clothes.

15:41.789 --> 15:45.178
Big new job Hawking
anti-aging potion.

15:45.179 --> 15:46.065
It makes sense.

15:46.066 --> 15:48.616
What if there's more
to it than that?

15:48.650 --> 15:50.881
I mean, maybe she's
thinking about leaving dad.

15:50.915 --> 15:52.080
Detective Rizzoli.

15:53.479 --> 15:54.644
All right, I'll see ya.

15:55.711 --> 15:57.242
Mr. Colburn...

15:57.276 --> 15:59.507
We subpoenaed a lot of
records from the estate.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.272
I don't see you carrying any files.

16:01.306 --> 16:03.504
There are sensitive
international finances involved.

16:04.304 --> 16:06.368
We can't have those
documents floating around.

16:06.403 --> 16:08.333
So the Fairfields
are above the law?

16:08.367 --> 16:09.333
Not at all.

16:09.367 --> 16:10.998
We're giving our
complete cooperation.

16:11.033 --> 16:12.697
Yeah, I can see that.

16:12.731 --> 16:16.160
Look, I'm not fooled
by your $5,000 suit.

16:17.046 --> 16:18.967
I ran your background.
I know where you come from.

16:18.968 --> 16:20.391
St. Luke's parish.
That's a tough neighborhood.

16:20.425 --> 16:21.822
Well, I've come a
long way from there.

16:21.857 --> 16:24.287
Maybe too far when you're
blindly protecting rich bosses.

16:27.918 --> 16:30.849
My father collected trash.

16:32.082 --> 16:34.879
I'd be doing the same if it
wasn't for the Fairfields.

16:34.913 --> 16:37.809
Their foundation put me through
college and law school.

16:38.943 --> 16:40.974
They gave me a job, they let
me rise to where I am now...

16:41.009 --> 16:42.675
What, they "let" you?

16:47.104 --> 16:50.467
I have assurances from the
top authorities in the state

16:50.501 --> 16:53.963
that this matter will be
handled swiftly and discreetly.

16:55.230 --> 16:56.794
You got that?

16:56.829 --> 17:00.825
I will handle this case the
way I handle all my cases.

17:00.859 --> 17:05.787
You seem like a bright young
woman with a promising future.

17:06.295 --> 17:08.852
I'd hate to see your
career path cut short.

17:20.974 --> 17:21.979
I had B.R.I.C. detectives

17:21.980 --> 17:24.469
go through 27 hours
of security footage

17:24.470 --> 17:25.608
on Sumner's bike route.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.675
Let me guess... No sign
of him or his motorcycle.

17:27.709 --> 17:28.741
Nope. Nothing.

17:28.775 --> 17:31.272
Jane's getting
stonewalled by Colburn.

17:31.306 --> 17:32.437
Can't get near the wife.

17:32.472 --> 17:34.203
No idea if the wife even
has an alibi or not.

17:34.237 --> 17:35.534
Can't talk to Garrett, either.

17:35.569 --> 17:38.300
He flew in from Los Angeles
by private jet Sunday morning.

17:38.971 --> 17:40.242
After the murder.

17:41.032 --> 17:43.829
Preliminary autopsy report.

17:43.862 --> 17:46.093
Why give that to
us instead of Jane?

17:46.127 --> 17:48.292
Don't go there.

17:48.325 --> 17:50.056
There's evidence of
blunt-force trauma,

17:50.091 --> 17:52.288
which could have happened
when he fell off the boat.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.654
Pulmonary edema from drowning.

17:53.688 --> 17:56.818
His stomach contents were
"unusually well-preserved."

17:56.852 --> 17:58.717
It's odd because I
was able to determine

17:58.751 --> 18:00.748
that he had belon oysters
at his last meal.

18:00.782 --> 18:01.981
Belon oysters?

18:02.015 --> 18:03.613
They're supposed to be amazing.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.111
What are you,
a friggin' foodie now?

18:05.145 --> 18:06.344
Well, they are prized

18:06.378 --> 18:09.875
for their unique
tannic seawater flavor.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.505
I read about them in the weekly.

18:12.540 --> 18:14.737
Only a couple restaurants
in town serve them.

18:14.771 --> 18:16.914
Maybe we can figure out
where he ate lunch.

18:16.915 --> 18:18.240
Any restaurant near a harbor?

18:21.042 --> 18:23.734
Maison de la mer. Nahant.

18:24.830 --> 18:26.394
Hey, I like oysters.

18:26.429 --> 18:28.093
They fry them, right?

18:28.827 --> 18:30.358
What? No, no, no.

18:30.392 --> 18:32.323
They serve them raw
on the half shell.

18:33.523 --> 18:34.662
Come with us.

18:34.663 --> 18:36.520
I will. Thank you.

18:49.941 --> 18:53.471
Belon oysters served raw with
a touch of natural sea salt,

18:53.472 --> 18:55.437
and the chef recommends
you not chew them.

18:55.471 --> 18:57.768
Food you can't chew.
And you pay for that?

19:02.432 --> 19:05.162
Have you seen this
guy in here recently?

19:05.197 --> 19:07.860
I can't say that I have.
Lot of that going around.

19:13.796 --> 19:15.515
Damn, that's good.

19:15.516 --> 19:18.351
Dry, metallic. Delicious.

19:18.386 --> 19:19.784
You can't look at a dead body,

19:19.819 --> 19:21.349
but you could slurp that snot down?

19:21.384 --> 19:23.880
That's what it is,
you know... oyster snot.

19:26.779 --> 19:29.076
Whoa. Receipt from
a corporate card...

19:29.111 --> 19:30.509
Sullivan control systems.

19:31.176 --> 19:32.607
It's a Fairfield subsidiary.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.637
"John Hancock." 
That's hardly creative.

19:36.671 --> 19:39.434
Hey, pal, can you pull the
order off this receipt?

19:42.067 --> 19:43.832
Sure you're not gonna eat that?

19:43.865 --> 19:45.097
More for me.

19:45.131 --> 19:47.262
Glass of chateau de
beaucastel sirah,

19:47.296 --> 19:51.159
mount eden chardonnay,
nicoise salad, D.O.S.

19:51.193 --> 19:53.091
Dressing on the side.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.122
It's chick food.

19:55.157 --> 19:57.554
Well...

19:57.588 --> 19:59.153
No, no, no. Y-you're accurate.

19:59.187 --> 20:01.084
I do prefer my
dressing on the side.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.916
May be a guy watching
his cholesterol.

20:02.950 --> 20:05.981
Over fine wine at a romantic,
seaside restaurant?

20:06.015 --> 20:07.446
Maybe he loves his wife.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.411
Uh, Jocelyn said she
didn't see him that day.

20:10.445 --> 20:11.610
So who did?

20:21.121 --> 20:22.200
Hey.

20:22.968 --> 20:26.364
It's got 24-karat
gold flakes in it.

20:26.398 --> 20:28.196
Are you making fun of me?

20:28.231 --> 20:30.128
No! I thought it
would be fun to try.

20:36.524 --> 20:38.354
Will you run some
tests on this please?

20:39.855 --> 20:42.518
What case? Is Jane's mother
poisoning the neighborhood?

20:42.552 --> 20:43.517
Uh-oh.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.949
Sure.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.980
So, you gonna try the chocolate?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.978
What are you so dressed up for?

20:50.012 --> 20:51.078
No reason.

20:51.112 --> 20:52.477
Is this an apology?

20:54.343 --> 20:55.308
For what?

20:55.342 --> 20:56.373
Oh, boy.

20:56.408 --> 20:58.206
Unh-unh, unh-unh-unh.

20:58.678 --> 21:00.065
You ask her.

21:04.601 --> 21:06.632
Jane thought maybe Garrett would
tell you the name of the woman

21:06.666 --> 21:08.530
his brother had lunch
with before he died.

21:10.430 --> 21:11.828
So this is a bribe.

21:14.660 --> 21:17.457
Tell Jane that if she thinks
that chocolate will induce me

21:17.491 --> 21:20.188
to use my personal relationship
with Garrett Fairfield,

21:20.222 --> 21:21.620
she doesn't know me very well.

21:21.654 --> 21:24.018
Tell Maura that I didn't realize

21:24.052 --> 21:25.950
I needed to bribe her
with the hope diamond...

21:25.984 --> 21:26.949
My phone....To ge...

21:26.983 --> 21:29.780
I got to take this. Korsak.

21:36.376 --> 21:38.640
You looked really at
home in that world.

21:38.674 --> 21:41.438
It's where I'm from.
It's not where I chose to stay.

21:41.472 --> 21:43.636
Well, what are you doing
down here slumming with us?

21:45.402 --> 21:46.534
The same as you!

21:46.568 --> 21:48.032
I'm catching bad guys.

21:48.067 --> 21:49.631
I need the job. You don't.

21:51.963 --> 21:53.960
Look, I want my life to
have meaning and purpose,

21:53.995 --> 21:55.126
the same as you.

21:58.292 --> 22:00.356
Sounds good, Maura.

22:00.390 --> 22:02.487
I-I don't know what
to believe anymore.

22:03.554 --> 22:05.651
I'm not even sure
whose side you're on.

22:23.662 --> 22:25.250
Your form still looks good.

22:25.747 --> 22:26.999
So does yours.

22:27.868 --> 22:30.298
You still running marathons?
Once a year.

22:30.333 --> 22:32.497
I don't really have time for more.
Work's pretty busy.

22:32.531 --> 22:35.228
Is that why you're here?

22:36.761 --> 22:39.658
Please tell me you
didn't learn how to lie.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.456
That was one of your
most endearing traits.

22:47.785 --> 22:49.275
The investigators think
that your brother

22:49.276 --> 22:52.314
had lunch with a
woman before he died.

22:52.348 --> 22:53.680
They were hoping
you might know who.

22:57.411 --> 23:01.474
There's a reason I based my
clothing company out of Milan.

23:01.508 --> 23:02.706
I think I know why.

23:04.106 --> 23:05.637
We used to talk a lot, remember?

23:05.671 --> 23:08.900
It might've just been
talk if it wasn't for you.

23:11.666 --> 23:14.563
You inspired me to take a risk,

23:14.597 --> 23:17.760
go out on my own, get away
from the clutches of my family.

23:19.927 --> 23:21.824
And you did it. You got out.

23:25.222 --> 23:26.920
Sumner and Adam, they fought a lot.

23:29.485 --> 23:31.183
So what are you saying,
that... that Sumner

23:31.217 --> 23:33.015
had something to do
with Adam's death? No.

23:33.641 --> 23:36.079
Fairfields will do a lot
of things to each other,

23:36.113 --> 23:39.310
but...Brothers don't kill brothers.

23:46.205 --> 23:47.737
You're not married, are you?

23:48.238 --> 23:49.508
No.

23:52.200 --> 23:55.730
I have to come back to
Boston and run the business.

23:56.863 --> 23:58.894
I can't leave it to Sumner.

23:58.928 --> 24:00.026
He's a mess.

24:02.593 --> 24:03.890
Do you know who Adam was seeing?

24:07.955 --> 24:10.319
Would you tell me if I
promise to be discreet?

24:14.449 --> 24:17.180
There hasn't been anyone
serious for a long time.

24:19.146 --> 24:20.311
How long?

24:21.544 --> 24:23.275
College.

24:32.935 --> 24:33.899
Rizzoli.

24:33.934 --> 24:34.933
Jane.

24:34.966 --> 24:36.164
Maura, I'm sorry.

24:36.198 --> 24:38.829
It's okay. Listen,
I don't have a lot of time.

24:38.863 --> 24:40.994
Adam had a mistress.
Vanessa Dewald.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.356
Why... why are you doing this?

24:48.822 --> 24:50.153
Because I have your back.

24:50.187 --> 24:52.152
I gotta go.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.745
Thanks.

25:00.779 --> 25:02.343
Miss me?

25:02.378 --> 25:04.608
Yeah.

25:05.909 --> 25:08.905
Rizzoli just called.
Nicoise-salad eater has a name.

25:10.938 --> 25:13.601
Vanessa Dewald.
Adam Fairfield's mistress?

25:13.636 --> 25:15.633
Rizzoli tracked her down,
talked to her.

25:15.667 --> 25:18.464
Her alibi checks out,
but she had this interesting tidbit...

25:18.498 --> 25:19.996
Adam was divorcing his wife.

25:20.030 --> 25:21.328
Rich guys have prenups.

25:21.363 --> 25:24.293
Jocelyn stood to lose hundreds
of millions of dollars

25:24.327 --> 25:25.525
if Adam divorced her.

25:25.559 --> 25:27.457
Ouch.

25:27.491 --> 25:29.055
That's hundreds of
millions of motives.

25:32.853 --> 25:34.085
Korsak.

25:34.119 --> 25:36.483
Great. On our way.

25:36.518 --> 25:38.615
Harbor patrol found the boat.

25:38.649 --> 25:41.212
I'll call Jane.

25:47.442 --> 25:48.807
Excuse us, gentlemen.

25:48.841 --> 25:51.238
Boat was found in our waters.

25:51.272 --> 25:53.070
It's a federal investigation now.

25:56.069 --> 25:58.732
It's... it's a nice
ventriloquism act.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.363
Yeah, I can barely
see your lips moving.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.259
Our tow boat's on the way to
take this craft to our slip.

26:06.293 --> 26:08.024
That "craft" is our crime scene.

26:08.059 --> 26:09.656
It's our jurisdiction. Move.

26:11.456 --> 26:13.886
You want kids?

26:13.920 --> 26:16.040
I would move.

26:42.515 --> 26:45.017
All right. You win.

26:45.018 --> 26:46.251
Blood on the boom.

26:46.252 --> 26:48.991
Hit his head, he got disoriented,

26:49.026 --> 26:50.324
fell overboard.

26:51.757 --> 26:53.289
It's an accident.

26:54.588 --> 26:56.453
I got his wallet

26:56.487 --> 26:59.817
and some sort of inhaler.

26:59.851 --> 27:01.881
He had asthma.

27:01.916 --> 27:04.813
Furling rig, twin helms,
graceful shear,

27:04.847 --> 27:07.011
teak-capped railed, French...

27:07.045 --> 27:08.309
She's a beaut.

27:08.343 --> 27:10.308
Man, you need to get some.

27:10.342 --> 27:12.273
This from a man who
makes love to an oyster?

27:13.640 --> 27:15.337
Jane, I did a
once-around the hull...

27:15.372 --> 27:16.503
No scrapes, no fender marks.

27:16.538 --> 27:17.802
Nothing docked with her at sea.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.067
Man, I'm cool, all right?

27:19.102 --> 27:21.698
I can admit when I'm wrong.
Call it an accident.

27:21.733 --> 27:23.165
I wish I could.

27:24.564 --> 27:25.962
But it wasn't an accident.

27:26.996 --> 27:28.794
Adam Fairfield was murdered.

27:37.103 --> 27:38.891
The mikrosil casting came back.

27:38.892 --> 27:40.611
We got a partial
impression of the object

27:40.612 --> 27:42.760
that struck Adam Fairfield's skull.

27:42.761 --> 27:44.160
It wasn't the boat's boom?

27:44.194 --> 27:45.592
There's nothing on that boat

27:45.626 --> 27:48.123
that matches the impressions
left on Adam's skull.

27:48.665 --> 27:52.020
So somebody planted
the blood on the boom.

27:52.055 --> 27:54.319
That's the only explanation
I can come up with.

27:54.353 --> 27:56.183
Wow.

27:56.851 --> 27:59.215
So, the killer hides
on Adam's boat,

27:59.249 --> 28:01.179
he waits until Adam is out to sea,

28:01.214 --> 28:03.744
hits him over the
head with a weapon

28:03.779 --> 28:06.309
and then throws the weapon
and the body overboard.

28:06.343 --> 28:08.507
Yeah, but how does he or
she get back to shore?

28:08.541 --> 28:10.538
Maybe a boat or a dinghy.

28:10.573 --> 28:12.671
Korsak said there was nothing
docked against the boat.

28:12.705 --> 28:16.100
Then there's an accomplice
on another boat nearby.

28:18.201 --> 28:20.097
It's a pretty perfect murder.

28:20.132 --> 28:23.133
Except that the imprints of the
skull would match the weapon.

28:23.134 --> 28:25.626
Which is 20,000
leagues under the sea.

28:26.227 --> 28:29.827
Oh, ac... that's actually a
reference to unit of distance.

28:30.030 --> 28:32.158
Leagues across the ocean,
not depth.

28:32.159 --> 28:34.325
It's at the bottom of the ocean.

28:34.326 --> 28:35.971
Do you have a plan of finding it?

28:35.972 --> 28:38.203
Not a good one.

28:41.700 --> 28:42.633
Hmm.

28:42.667 --> 28:43.832
What?

28:44.903 --> 28:47.428
There's just something
about these fibers

28:47.463 --> 28:49.760
on Adam's cashmere sweater.

28:50.948 --> 28:52.845
I'm gonna have the lab
take another look at it.

28:54.878 --> 28:56.043
You want to get a drink?

28:56.076 --> 28:57.908
Will it have gold flecks in it?

28:58.696 --> 28:59.701
No.

29:13.563 --> 29:16.360
The cabernet here is chalky.

29:16.394 --> 29:18.491
Have a beer. It's cold.

29:18.526 --> 29:20.190
I don't drink beer.

29:21.423 --> 29:22.688
Right.

29:22.723 --> 29:25.685
Well, we know for a
fact that it's a murder,

29:25.720 --> 29:29.449
and we have two solid
suspects with motive...

29:30.316 --> 29:32.580
the wife, 'cause she
didn't want a divorce,

29:32.615 --> 29:35.246
and Sumner, because he's pissed
at Adam for pushing him out.

29:35.247 --> 29:37.515
And Colburn, who won't
let you near them.

29:38.498 --> 29:39.673
Please don't talk to
me about that guy.

29:39.674 --> 29:40.871
***

29:42.297 --> 29:44.794
You want to tell me what
happened with Garrett?

29:44.829 --> 29:48.058
There's not much to tell.

29:52.622 --> 29:55.819
Ugh.

29:56.919 --> 29:58.416
I loved that guy.

30:02.015 --> 30:03.187
You know when you're so in love,

30:03.188 --> 30:05.152
you feel like you took
some kind of a substance?

30:05.153 --> 30:07.315
Oh, that's just narcissism.

30:07.316 --> 30:09.314
Maybe.

30:10.680 --> 30:13.630
By the way, I, uh, I ran some tests

30:13.631 --> 30:15.642
on your mother's miracle juice.

30:16.576 --> 30:19.039
It's 98% water.

30:19.074 --> 30:22.403
The rest is sodium citrate,
monopotassium phosphate.

30:22.438 --> 30:24.235
Anything harmful? No.

30:24.270 --> 30:26.167
But there's nothing
helpful, either.

30:27.233 --> 30:28.632
I should tell Frankie.

30:28.666 --> 30:31.597
Oh, I, uh, I brought you a...

30:31.630 --> 30:34.794
a present.

30:34.828 --> 30:37.592
Apology or bribe?

30:40.457 --> 30:44.019
"The Fairfield family invite
you and a guest to a memorial."

30:44.054 --> 30:45.797
Uh, Maura, this is tonight.

30:45.798 --> 30:47.717
Yeah, I wasn't gonna go.

30:47.750 --> 30:49.874
But you wanted access to my ***,

30:49.875 --> 30:51.286
Sumner and Jocelyn.

30:51.287 --> 30:53.060
I want you to be my guest.

30:54.363 --> 30:55.709
Won't I embarrass you?

30:55.710 --> 30:58.240
Probably. But haven't
I embarrassed you?

30:58.275 --> 31:00.138
No...

31:00.173 --> 31:02.470
More than half a dozen times.

31:03.537 --> 31:07.167
"Cocktail dress required."

31:07.200 --> 31:08.598
Can't I just go like this?

31:08.633 --> 31:10.264
If you're going to embarrass me,

31:10.298 --> 31:11.996
at least do it in
the proper clothes.

31:12.030 --> 31:13.795
Come on.

31:13.829 --> 31:15.959
I have most of my money tied
up in charitable endowments,

31:15.994 --> 31:17.957
but not all.

31:25.786 --> 31:28.216
I feel like I'm at my junior prom.

31:30.516 --> 31:32.246
What?

31:34.379 --> 31:35.560
Okay, I think I'm getting a wedgie.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.046
Cover me. Oh, God.

31:37.047 --> 31:39.435
Can't you do this in the bathroom?

31:39.436 --> 31:40.971
No, it'll just take a second.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.668
Thank you. Thank you.

31:52.930 --> 31:54.862
Wow. Thanks.

31:54.896 --> 31:56.960
That is good.

31:56.994 --> 31:58.958
Lefevre brut. Ohh.

32:00.158 --> 32:02.656
Can't get that at 7-eleven,
can you?

32:02.690 --> 32:04.620
Man. How much?

32:04.655 --> 32:06.586
How much? I don't know.

32:06.620 --> 32:09.117
Guess. No.

32:09.616 --> 32:11.029
100 bucks?

32:11.030 --> 32:13.047
Maybe. I-I don't know.

32:13.081 --> 32:15.145
100 bucks a bottle? Wow.

32:15.179 --> 32:18.243
A glass. Mm.

32:18.278 --> 32:19.842
Really? God,
no wonder it's so good.

32:19.876 --> 32:22.640
My mother would be trying to
smuggle it home in her purse.

32:24.872 --> 32:25.870
Can you hold this?

32:25.904 --> 32:27.768
Thank you.

32:32.532 --> 32:35.396
Oh, the results came back for
the fibers on Adam's sweater.

32:35.430 --> 32:36.928
Do you mind if I just send
this to Frost to check it out?

32:36.962 --> 32:38.027
No. Go ahead.

32:39.261 --> 32:40.524
Maura.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.856
Wow.

32:42.890 --> 32:44.555
You look beautiful.

32:44.589 --> 32:46.587
Thank you.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.718
You remember my friend,
Jane Rizzoli.

32:49.752 --> 32:50.717
Of course. Hello.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.638
You're both absolutely
breathtaking.

32:52.639 --> 32:54.233
Thank you. Thank you.

32:54.234 --> 32:57.109
Usually, this would
be a celebration,

32:57.568 --> 33:00.521
a big gala to raise money
for Boston charities.

33:00.522 --> 33:02.108
Tonight, it's for Adam.

33:04.074 --> 33:06.204
I guess it falls on me to
commission a painting of him.

33:06.239 --> 33:11.034
And the trophy we won
when we were 8 and 10.

33:11.069 --> 33:13.298
We used to trade it back and forth.

33:14.732 --> 33:16.963
I brought it home for him.

33:17.633 --> 33:19.261
It's a lovely gesture.

33:22.126 --> 33:23.291
Excuse me.

33:23.325 --> 33:25.423
Of course.

33:28.055 --> 33:28.708
Mm?

33:28.709 --> 33:30.885
Give me that. Mm.

33:30.919 --> 33:32.300
Mm!

33:32.301 --> 33:34.082
Give it to me.

33:34.116 --> 33:36.314
I am hungry.

33:39.379 --> 33:42.180
Branzino with a
meuniÃ¨re reduction.

33:42.181 --> 33:43.977
Ugh, it... it's looking at me

33:43.978 --> 33:46.306
like I personally put the hook in.

33:47.472 --> 33:49.636
How am I supposed to eat that?

33:49.671 --> 33:52.068
Use your fish knife.

33:52.102 --> 33:54.333
It's next to the melon spoon.

33:55.466 --> 33:57.829
Second from the right.

34:01.062 --> 34:02.526
Hold it like a pencil.

34:02.561 --> 34:04.358
Okay?

34:04.393 --> 34:06.656
Use the tip to cut the backbone.

34:07.822 --> 34:10.886
Then you cut the tail,

34:10.920 --> 34:13.018
and you place it on
the side of the plate.

34:13.052 --> 34:16.514
Use this edge of the
knife to remove the skin,

34:16.550 --> 34:18.513
and place it at the
head of the plate.

34:18.547 --> 34:20.911
There we go.

34:20.946 --> 34:22.277
Okay?

34:22.311 --> 34:27.007
Okay, uh, this is how
we do it in my family.

34:27.907 --> 34:29.638
Oh!

34:37.399 --> 34:38.963
It's okay. Just eat it.

34:38.998 --> 34:40.996
It's delicious.

34:41.030 --> 34:43.827
Why do they serve beef
Wellington after fish?

34:43.860 --> 34:46.414
And why does everything
have to be so juicy?

34:50.788 --> 34:52.253
That's interesting.

34:52.286 --> 34:55.150
That explains why their
alibis don't check out.

34:55.185 --> 34:56.849
Because they were probably
with each other. Mm-hmm.

34:56.884 --> 34:59.413
Killing Adam Fairfield.

35:02.279 --> 35:03.877
Detective. A moment.

35:03.911 --> 35:05.441
Right after I talk to your two pals

35:05.442 --> 35:06.741
about killing Adam Fairfield.

35:06.775 --> 35:07.641
Please.

35:09.241 --> 35:11.505
Now, you've wondered what
I've been covering up?

35:11.539 --> 35:13.669
Well, now you know.
They're having an affair.

35:13.704 --> 35:15.135
No kidding.

35:15.169 --> 35:19.065
But I know for a fact that they
didn't kill Adam Fairfield.

35:19.099 --> 35:21.946
Oh, what do you got? We love facts.

35:28.179 --> 35:32.475
While Adam was sailing,
they were in a suite at the Ritz.

35:32.509 --> 35:33.540
All afternoon.

35:36.672 --> 35:38.837
So we just went from
two suspects to none.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.368
Actually...

35:40.403 --> 35:43.432
I think we may have a new one.

35:43.467 --> 35:45.431
I looked into that fiber for you.

35:48.329 --> 35:50.626
Good cashmere is 14 microns thick.

35:50.661 --> 35:52.255
This is 24.

35:52.925 --> 35:53.916
Subpar materials.

35:53.917 --> 35:56.122
W-why would Garrett be
using cheap cashmere?

35:56.156 --> 35:57.655
Because he's broke.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.153
I called his suppliers.

35:59.188 --> 36:00.752
He's behind on everything...

36:00.786 --> 36:03.750
Uh, materials, warehousing,
manufacturing, packaging.

36:03.784 --> 36:05.048
The guy hasn't paid
a bill in months.

36:06.282 --> 36:08.779
Okay, that makes no sense.
He inherited a fortune.

36:08.814 --> 36:11.044
Looks like he burned through
it all and then some.

36:14.342 --> 36:17.139
Okay, just because his
company's in trouble

36:17.174 --> 36:18.404
doesn't mean that he's a killer.

36:18.439 --> 36:21.469
I don't know.

36:21.503 --> 36:24.087
Maybe killing off your brother

36:24.088 --> 36:26.315
and inheriting the family empire,

36:26.743 --> 36:28.723
paying off your debt,
turns you into one.

36:30.196 --> 36:32.260
But he flew in after the murder.

36:32.294 --> 36:34.025
Flew in from Milan.

36:35.591 --> 36:36.636
Frost, uh,

36:36.637 --> 36:38.555
we can't get into that
private jet manifest, can we?

36:38.589 --> 36:40.753
No, we can only track the plane.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.982
Looks like it stopped
in L.A. to refuel.

36:47.016 --> 36:49.546
Got stuck there for three days.
Engine trouble.

36:49.580 --> 36:52.310
And he and the plane arrived
in Boston after the murder.

36:52.345 --> 36:53.710
Can we prove he was on that plane?

36:56.609 --> 36:58.938
Takes, what, three days to
drive from L.A. to Boston?

37:01.405 --> 37:03.802
Oh. You think he did
it in the spyker?

37:12.429 --> 37:13.494
Maura, I'm sorry.

37:27.187 --> 37:28.537
You okay?

37:30.115 --> 37:32.612
I should've seen it.

37:33.121 --> 37:34.453
You did.

37:34.454 --> 37:35.846
There is a reason

37:35.847 --> 37:37.774
that you didn't commit
to him after college.

37:37.808 --> 37:40.439
There is a reason that
you're holding back now.

37:40.474 --> 37:41.538
It's called gut instinct.

37:41.573 --> 37:43.237
But there were clues, and I...

37:43.271 --> 37:45.302
I couldn't put them
together. You did.

37:46.036 --> 37:48.599
You did it subconsciously.

37:51.032 --> 37:53.729
The oysters.
That's how I missed it.

37:53.763 --> 37:57.026
The oysters, and it was right
in front of me the whole time.

37:57.060 --> 37:58.782
Okay, come on.

37:58.783 --> 38:00.190
I-I'll take it from here, okay?

38:00.224 --> 38:02.588
Look, I-I thought
that Adam had asthma.

38:02.622 --> 38:05.319
But he was taking a drug to
treat panlobular emphysema,

38:05.354 --> 38:07.317
which is why he
couldn't digest food.

38:08.551 --> 38:09.949
He wasn't a smoker.

38:09.982 --> 38:12.647
That is great for him.

38:12.681 --> 38:15.044
The damage was caused by a disorder

38:15.079 --> 38:17.609
called alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency.

38:20.674 --> 38:22.436
S-sweetie, I-I'm sorry.

38:22.437 --> 38:23.805
I-I don't know why
you're telling me this.

38:23.839 --> 38:25.003
It's inherited.

38:26.136 --> 38:27.836
The illness that Adam had,

38:27.837 --> 38:31.638
all of the Fairfield children
should have, but they don't.

38:32.398 --> 38:34.862
Because Adam had a
different father.

38:34.897 --> 38:36.660
And that's who carried
the fatal gene.

38:36.695 --> 38:37.993
Adam was a half-brother.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.324
So that's why he didn't
inherit the family business.

38:41.358 --> 38:42.723
Because he wasn't
part of the bloodline.

38:42.756 --> 38:43.954
He wasn't a Brahmin.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.978
Wait... why didn't the
father give it to Garrett?

38:46.979 --> 38:48.096
He was next in line.

38:49.484 --> 38:51.715
Because they had a
terrible relationship.

38:53.215 --> 38:54.513
Garrett always used to say

38:54.547 --> 38:56.978
that he wanted to make
his own way in the world.

38:59.311 --> 39:00.908
And I'm not sure he had a choice.

39:00.942 --> 39:03.306
And then that didn't work
because he was going bankrupt.

39:06.671 --> 39:08.435
Garrett said that brothers
don't kill brothers.

39:08.469 --> 39:11.133
I think he justified what he did

39:11.167 --> 39:14.664
because in his mind,
Adam wasn't his brother.

39:14.698 --> 39:16.529
It's motive, but it's not proof.

39:17.529 --> 39:19.260
Maybe Garrett didn't do it.
Jane, he did it.

39:20.660 --> 39:23.356
And I think I know
where the proof is.

39:23.391 --> 39:27.287
It's how he got
from L.A. to Boston.

39:41.381 --> 39:42.796
There's only one person I know

39:42.797 --> 39:45.250
who could've committed a
murder one mile out at sea

39:45.251 --> 39:47.572
and still gotten
back without a boat.

39:47.573 --> 39:48.819
A triathlete.

39:51.052 --> 39:51.954
Maura.

39:51.955 --> 39:54.582
You know, you said brothers
don't kill brothers.

39:54.583 --> 39:56.279
But you knew that Adam
had a different father,

39:56.280 --> 39:56.914
so in your mind,

39:56.915 --> 39:59.010
that meant that he wasn't
really your brother.

40:00.057 --> 40:02.821
Maura, come on.

40:02.855 --> 40:04.187
You know me.

40:06.053 --> 40:10.449
The murder weapon left a unique
impression in Adam's skull.

40:10.483 --> 40:12.846
Like this one.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.110
It's the same pattern,
isn't it, Maura?

40:17.243 --> 40:18.575
We found it in your trunk.

40:21.041 --> 40:23.304
Run tests, Maura.
You won't find anything on that.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.503
'Cause this one is new.

40:24.538 --> 40:26.202
The one that you used to
kill your half-brother

40:26.236 --> 40:27.568
is at the bottom of the ocean.

40:31.799 --> 40:33.830
Have security escort
the two ladies out.

40:33.863 --> 40:34.929
Step out of the pool.

40:35.442 --> 40:36.894
Colburn.

40:39.126 --> 40:41.257
I think you should step out
of the pool, Mr. Fairfield.

40:43.090 --> 40:45.154
Colburn, what are you doing?

40:45.188 --> 40:46.353
You work for me.

40:48.786 --> 40:50.250
I work for the Fairfields.

40:57.844 --> 41:00.142
Okay.

41:00.176 --> 41:02.973
Here we go.

41:03.007 --> 41:05.604
Yeah, I-I'm not really in a
champagne kind of a mood.

41:05.638 --> 41:06.870
Good. It's beer.

41:07.936 --> 41:09.934
I thought we would celebrate
the simple things in life.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.299
I don't really drink beer.

41:11.334 --> 41:13.398
That's 'cause you've
never had my beer.

41:13.432 --> 41:16.762
Okay, well, can we at
least drink it your way?

41:16.796 --> 41:20.226
Yes, we can. Let's -
let's get this right.

41:25.123 --> 41:27.487
Remember when you asked
me why I was slumming?

41:28.754 --> 41:30.385
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said that.

41:32.983 --> 41:34.514
Well, now you know.

41:36.647 --> 41:38.678
Okay.

41:38.712 --> 41:40.110
Cheers.

41:40.144 --> 41:41.142
Cheers.

41:43.808 --> 41:46.006
Okay.

41:49.436 --> 41:50.735
That's delicious.

41:50.769 --> 41:52.667
Right? Wait till you try a spuckie.

41:53.933 --> 41:55.498
I don't know what that is,

41:55.531 --> 41:57.130
but it sounds really... Mmm.
