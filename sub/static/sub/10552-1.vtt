02:35.437 --> 02:37.405
Hello, stranger.

03:12.574 --> 03:14.804
Sorry. Looking for a cigarette.

03:15.711 --> 03:17.042
I've given up.

03:19.748 --> 03:21.113
Thank you.

03:23.452 --> 03:25.682
- Got to be somewhere?
- Work.

03:27.222 --> 03:29.213
You didn't fancy my sandwiches?

03:29.325 --> 03:31.953
- Don't eat fish.
- Why not?

03:32.828 --> 03:34.523
Fish piss in the sea.

03:35.030 --> 03:37.863
- So do children.
- Don't eat children, either.

03:39.168 --> 03:40.658
What's your work?

03:40.736 --> 03:42.897
I'm sort of a journalist.

03:43.238 --> 03:46.071
- What sort?
- I write obituaries.

03:58.053 --> 04:00.214
Are we in for a long wait?

04:02.324 --> 04:04.451
She was 21 when she came in.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.319
Does it hurt?

04:09.031 --> 04:10.362
I'll live.

04:11.467 --> 04:13.935
Do you want me to put your leg up?

04:14.003 --> 04:15.561
Yes, please.

04:30.386 --> 04:32.377
Who cut off your crusts?

04:32.821 --> 04:33.810
Me.

04:33.889 --> 04:36.824
Did your mother cut off your crusts
when you were a little boy?

04:36.892 --> 04:40.259
- Yes, I believe she did.
- You should eat your crusts.

04:40.629 --> 04:42.529
You should stop smoking.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.556
How long was I out?

04:45.634 --> 04:48.194
- About 10 seconds.
- Then what?

04:49.471 --> 04:51.462
You came to. You focused on me.

04:51.540 --> 04:54.236
You said, "Hello, stranger."

04:54.309 --> 04:55.867
What a floozy.

04:55.944 --> 04:59.778
The cabbie crossed himself, he went,
"Thank fuck. I thought I'd killed her."

04:59.848 --> 05:02.214
I said, "Let's get her to a hospital."
He hesitated.

05:02.284 --> 05:05.583
I think he thought there'd be paperwork
and he'd be held responsible.

05:05.654 --> 05:09.112
So I said with a slight sneer,
"Please just drop us at the hospital."

05:09.191 --> 05:10.783
Show me the sneer.

05:11.727 --> 05:13.695
Very good, buster.

05:14.763 --> 05:16.253
Thank you.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.304
- I told you, I've given up.
- Try harder.

05:27.376 --> 05:28.934
You live here?

05:29.344 --> 05:31.539
Just arrived from New York.

05:32.247 --> 05:34.181
Taking a vacation?

05:34.249 --> 05:36.149
I'm on an expedition.

05:36.785 --> 05:38.582
Where's your baggage?

05:39.721 --> 05:42.451
- Where are you staying?
- I'm a waif.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.584
A red bus.

05:48.330 --> 05:52.664
Policeman or "bobby."
Observe the distinctive helmet.

05:54.303 --> 05:56.828
Saint Paul's Cathedral.
Please note the famous dome.

05:56.905 --> 06:00.739
- This is a truly magnificent tour.
- It's the London tourists never get to see.

06:00.809 --> 06:03.642
- What's this?
- I've no idea.

06:24.399 --> 06:28.165
They're all people
who died saving the lives of others.

06:29.838 --> 06:31.738
I've been here before.

06:41.350 --> 06:44.183
Twenty years ago, we came here.

06:45.420 --> 06:49.413
My mother's dead. My father and I came here
the afternoon she died.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.857
She was a smoker.
She died in the hospital, actually.

06:54.930 --> 06:57.660
- Is your father still alive?
- Hanging on.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.397
He's in a home.

07:00.035 --> 07:03.300
- You're late for work.
- You saying you want me to go?

07:03.372 --> 07:05.272
I'm saying you're late for work.

07:05.974 --> 07:08.534
How did you end up writing obituaries?

07:08.844 --> 07:12.974
Well, I had dreams of being a writer,
but I had no voice.

07:13.615 --> 07:15.981
What am I saying? I had no talent.

07:16.051 --> 07:20.317
So I ended up in obituaries,
which is the Siberia of journalism.

07:20.556 --> 07:24.253
Tell me what you do.
I want to imagine you in Siberia.

07:24.326 --> 07:25.657
Really?

07:28.564 --> 07:31.397
We call it "the obits page."

07:32.434 --> 07:35.267
There's three of us: Me, Graham, and Harry.

07:35.871 --> 07:40.001
When I get to work, without fail...
Are you sure you want to know?

07:41.043 --> 07:45.139
Well, if someone important died,
we go to the "deep freeze"...

07:48.617 --> 07:52.144
which is a computer file...

07:52.221 --> 07:55.486
with all the obituaries,
and we find the dead person's life.

07:55.557 --> 07:58.219
People's obituaries are written
while they're still alive?

07:58.293 --> 07:59.885
Some people's.

08:00.462 --> 08:03.522
Then Harry, he's the editor,
decides who we'll lead with.

08:03.599 --> 08:05.794
Then we make calls, check facts.

08:05.867 --> 08:10.429
At 6:00, we stand around the computer
and look at the next day's page...

08:11.240 --> 08:13.538
and make final changes.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.673
Add a few euphemisms
for our own amusement.

08:16.745 --> 08:18.076
Such as?

08:20.349 --> 08:24.547
"He was a convivial fellow."
Meaning he was an alcoholic.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.721
"He valued his privacy." Gay.

08:29.191 --> 08:31.955
"He enjoyed his privacy." Raging queen.

08:33.160 --> 08:35.220
What would my euphemism be?

08:36.198 --> 08:39.190
- "She was disarming."
- That's not a euphemism.

08:40.068 --> 08:41.558
Yes, it is.

08:50.579 --> 08:53.480
- What were you doing in New York?
- You know.

08:56.618 --> 09:01.021
Well, no, I don't. What, were you studying?

09:01.189 --> 09:02.486
Stripping.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.189
Look at your little eyes.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.161
I can't see my little eyes.

09:14.603 --> 09:16.093
Why did you leave?

09:16.705 --> 09:18.696
Problems with a male.

09:18.974 --> 09:20.635
- Boyfriend?
- Kind of.

09:21.810 --> 09:24.040
And you left him, just like that?

09:24.112 --> 09:28.139
It's the only way to leave.
"I don't love you anymore. Goodbye."

09:28.216 --> 09:31.413
- Supposing you do still love them?
- You don't leave.

09:32.254 --> 09:35.417
- You've never left somebody you still love?
- No.

09:39.328 --> 09:40.886
This is me.

09:47.302 --> 09:48.963
Enjoy your stay.

09:50.305 --> 09:53.468
Please remember
our traffic tends to come from the right.

09:55.243 --> 09:56.335
Bye.

10:09.157 --> 10:11.057
Do you have a girlfriend?

10:11.426 --> 10:12.757
Yeah. Ruth.

10:13.328 --> 10:16.297
She's called Ruth. She's a linguist.

10:17.699 --> 10:19.860
- What's your name?
- Alice.

10:21.002 --> 10:23.436
My name is Alice Ayres.

10:30.445 --> 10:31.605
Good.

10:31.713 --> 10:34.876
I'm just gonna change the film.
Are you okay for time?

10:39.020 --> 10:41.682
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Lf you must.

10:42.858 --> 10:45.383
- I don't have to.
- Then don't.

10:57.506 --> 10:59.201
I liked your book.

11:00.108 --> 11:01.268
Thanks.

11:03.178 --> 11:06.079
- When's it published?
- Next year. How come you've read it?

11:06.148 --> 11:09.379
Your publisher sent me a manuscript.
I read it last night.

11:09.985 --> 11:11.919
You kept me up till 4:00.

11:12.954 --> 11:14.216
I'm flattered.

11:14.589 --> 11:17.057
Is your heroine
based on someone you know?

11:17.626 --> 11:19.787
Yes. She's someone called Alice.

11:20.295 --> 11:22.786
How does she feel
about you stealing her life?

11:22.864 --> 11:24.331
Borrowing her life.

11:24.466 --> 11:27.060
I'm dedicating the book to her.
She's pleased.

11:35.977 --> 11:37.342
Do you exhibit?

11:37.412 --> 11:40.313
Sometimes. I have a thing next year.

11:46.321 --> 11:47.652
Portraits?

11:49.724 --> 11:52.318
- Of who?
- Strangers.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.789
How do your strangers feel
about you stealing their lives?

11:58.967 --> 12:00.366
Borrowing.

12:01.937 --> 12:03.302
Am I a stranger?

12:04.239 --> 12:05.934
No. You're a job.

12:07.843 --> 12:09.902
And you're a sloucher. Sit up.

12:16.551 --> 12:18.018
You didn't find it obscene?

12:18.086 --> 12:19.678
- What?
- The book.

12:21.022 --> 12:23.149
I thought it was accurate.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.259
About what?

12:25.527 --> 12:27.859
About sex. About love.

12:28.196 --> 12:29.629
In what way?

12:30.098 --> 12:33.295
- You wrote it.
- You read it till 4:00.

12:33.635 --> 12:36.695
Don't raise your eyebrows.
It makes you look smug.

12:45.013 --> 12:48.278
- But you did like it?
- Yes, but I could go off it.

12:54.723 --> 12:56.054
Stand up.

13:02.330 --> 13:04.161
Any criticisms?

13:05.767 --> 13:07.325
I'm not sure about the title.

13:07.402 --> 13:08.960
Got a better one?

13:09.905 --> 13:11.372
<i>The Aquarium.</i>

13:12.374 --> 13:14.103
So you liked the filth.

13:14.442 --> 13:17.172
- You like aquariums.
- Fish are therapeutic.

13:17.245 --> 13:19.611
- Hang out in aquariums, do you?
- When I can.

13:19.681 --> 13:21.512
Good for picking up strangers?

13:21.583 --> 13:23.915
Photographing strangers.

13:33.562 --> 13:34.893
Come here.

13:52.180 --> 13:53.841
You're beautiful.

14:01.523 --> 14:03.855
I don't kiss strange men.

14:04.259 --> 14:05.749
Neither do I.

15:17.098 --> 15:19.760
Do you and this Alice live together?

15:24.572 --> 15:25.903
Yes.

15:37.452 --> 15:38.851
Are you married?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.251
Yes.

15:40.488 --> 15:43.082
- No. Yes.
- Which?

15:43.425 --> 15:45.086
Separated.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.354
- Do you have any children?
- No.

15:47.429 --> 15:50.421
- Would you like some?
- Yes, but not today.

15:51.166 --> 15:53.498
Would Alice like children?

15:54.536 --> 15:56.060
She's too young.

15:57.272 --> 16:00.764
She works in a cafÃ© near here.
She's coming to meet me.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.942
Quite soon.

16:05.613 --> 16:07.945
Why are you wasting her time?

16:09.084 --> 16:11.917
- You're judgmental.
- You're devious.

16:11.986 --> 16:15.683
I'm not wasting her time.
She's completely lovable.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.588
And completely unleavable.

16:17.659 --> 16:21.686
And you don't want someone else
getting their dirty hands on her.

16:21.796 --> 16:23.821
- Men are crap.
- But all the same...

16:23.898 --> 16:25.525
They're still crap.

16:27.302 --> 16:28.462
Your muse.

16:30.839 --> 16:33.831
- You've ruined my life.
- You'll get over it.

16:42.383 --> 16:43.543
Dan.

16:45.820 --> 16:47.151
Your shirt.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.295
You all done?

17:00.835 --> 17:03.463
- How's the photographer?
- Good. Professional.

17:04.472 --> 17:06.838
Rigorous. Beady. One of your lot.

17:06.907 --> 17:09.137
- What, female?
<i>- Americano.</i>

17:13.381 --> 17:14.712
Come on.

17:24.291 --> 17:25.520
Anna?

17:30.265 --> 17:31.926
- Alice.
- Hi.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.992
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, we've just finished.

17:35.603 --> 17:37.628
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.

17:37.705 --> 17:40.503
I've been serving it all day.
Can I use your loo?

17:40.575 --> 17:42.509
Sure. Just through there.

17:50.084 --> 17:51.381
She is beautiful.

17:51.452 --> 17:53.511
- I've got to see you.
- No.

17:53.988 --> 17:55.546
What's this? Patriotism?

17:55.623 --> 17:57.454
- I don't want trouble.
- I'm not trouble.

17:57.525 --> 17:58.924
You're taken.

18:01.062 --> 18:02.791
- I've got to see you.
- Tough.

18:02.864 --> 18:05.526
- You kissed me.
- What are you, 12?

18:08.903 --> 18:11.201
I'm a block of ice.

18:14.542 --> 18:16.339
Will you take my photo?

18:16.411 --> 18:19.107
I've never been photographed
by a professional before.

18:19.180 --> 18:21.774
I'd really appreciate it. I can pay you.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.579
No, I'd like to.

18:24.018 --> 18:25.849
Only if you don't mind.

18:26.454 --> 18:27.648
Why should I?

18:27.722 --> 18:29.713
Because you'll have to go away.

18:29.791 --> 18:32.624
We don't want him here
while we're working, do we?

18:32.794 --> 18:34.284
No, we don't.

18:37.298 --> 18:39.493
Right. I'll be in the pub on the corner.

18:39.567 --> 18:40.795
Have fun.

18:44.038 --> 18:45.369
Thank you.

18:45.707 --> 18:48.972
- Good luck with your exhibition.
- Good luck with your book.

19:04.492 --> 19:06.687
So you've got an exhibition?

19:07.629 --> 19:08.789
Yeah.

19:13.334 --> 19:15.165
I read Dan's book.

19:16.271 --> 19:19.069
You've had quite a life.

19:20.508 --> 19:21.839
Thanks.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.077
He said you work in a cafÃ©?

19:30.218 --> 19:32.049
I am a waitress.

19:32.387 --> 19:34.116
That's a temporary thing?

19:35.089 --> 19:36.078
No.

19:40.161 --> 19:42.652
Why don't you come over here and sit?

20:00.515 --> 20:02.983
- You live here?
- I do now.

20:03.251 --> 20:05.048
Because you're single?

20:05.653 --> 20:07.917
Who was your last boyfriend?

20:08.489 --> 20:09.751
My husband.

20:09.824 --> 20:11.416
Was he English?

20:11.826 --> 20:14.454
- Very.
- What happened to him?

20:16.030 --> 20:17.657
Someone younger.

20:20.001 --> 20:22.868
You've got a great face.

20:24.105 --> 20:25.766
Doesn't everyone?

20:27.141 --> 20:28.631
I suppose so.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.068
I just...

20:30.144 --> 20:33.079
From the book,
somehow I thought you'd be less...

20:33.548 --> 20:34.708
What?

20:37.719 --> 20:39.880
I don't know what, exactly.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.395
How do you feel about him using your life?

20:57.071 --> 20:59.539
It's really none of your business.

21:04.812 --> 21:07.246
When he let me in downstairs...

21:08.149 --> 21:09.810
he had this look.

21:12.220 --> 21:14.654
I just listened to your conversation.

21:19.394 --> 21:21.328
I don't know what to say.

21:25.166 --> 21:26.997
I'm not a thief, Alice.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.134
Do you want a drink?

21:35.209 --> 21:37.700
I have some vodka in the fridge.
We could have a drink.

21:37.779 --> 21:39.610
Just take my picture.

22:00.768 --> 22:01.826
Good.

29:19.678 --> 29:20.940
Anna?

29:25.117 --> 29:26.778
I got the coat.

29:27.553 --> 29:29.111
The white coat.

29:31.257 --> 29:32.588
So I see.

29:33.659 --> 29:35.991
I'm Larry. The doctor.

29:36.295 --> 29:37.592
Hello, Dr. Larry.

29:37.663 --> 29:40.598
Feel free to call me "The Sultan."

29:46.438 --> 29:49.407
I can't believe these things actually happen.

29:49.775 --> 29:52.243
I thought if you showed up,
you'd be an old trout.

29:52.311 --> 29:55.212
But you are bloody gorgeous.

29:56.181 --> 29:57.773
Well, thank you.

29:59.919 --> 30:02.717
Fish. You gotta respect them.

30:04.056 --> 30:05.887
- Have you?
- Of course.

30:06.525 --> 30:09.085
We were fish. Long ago.

30:09.495 --> 30:11.395
Before we were apes.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.034
You mentioned a hotel.

30:17.536 --> 30:19.026
No rush.

30:20.839 --> 30:24.138
Actually, there is.
I've got to be in surgery by 3:00.

30:24.843 --> 30:28.472
- Are you having an operation?
- No, I'm doing one.

30:29.315 --> 30:32.011
- Are you really a doctor?
- I said I was.

30:33.185 --> 30:34.846
You are Anna?

30:37.156 --> 30:40.614
I'm sorry. Did I photograph you?

30:40.960 --> 30:42.587
Did we meet somewhere?

30:42.661 --> 30:46.324
Come on. Don't play games,
you nymph of the Net.

30:46.765 --> 30:49.290
- Excuse me?
- You were up for it yesterday.

30:49.368 --> 30:52.667
- Was I?
- Yeah. "Wear my wet knickers.

30:53.639 --> 30:55.470
"Sit on my face.

30:56.508 --> 30:59.204
- "Cum-hungry bitch."
- Okay.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.875
Why do I feel like a pervert?

31:05.751 --> 31:09.278
I think you're the victim of a practical joke.

31:13.092 --> 31:15.686
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

31:19.832 --> 31:20.992
No.

31:22.434 --> 31:25.062
We spoke on the Net last night.
Now you've seen me...

31:25.137 --> 31:26.468
I wasn't on the Net last night.

31:26.538 --> 31:28.631
Where were you
between 6:45 and 7:00 p.m.?

31:28.707 --> 31:30.299
That's really none of your business.

31:30.376 --> 31:33.345
- Where were you?
- On the Net, talking to you.

31:34.146 --> 31:37.741
- Well, I was talking to someone.
- Someone pretending to be me.

31:41.286 --> 31:43.880
I think you were talking to Daniel Woolf.

31:43.956 --> 31:47.016
- Who?
- This guy I know. It's him.

31:47.092 --> 31:49.526
- No, I was talking to a woman.
- How do you know?

31:49.595 --> 31:52.257
Believe me, she was a woman.
I got a huge...

31:52.331 --> 31:55.129
She was a... She wasn't, was she?

31:55.501 --> 31:56.661
No.

31:57.036 --> 31:58.901
What a bastard.

32:04.343 --> 32:06.072
How do you know him?

32:06.145 --> 32:10.275
I don't really know him.
I took his photograph for a book he wrote.

32:10.349 --> 32:13.147
- I hope it sank without a trace.
- It's on its way.

32:13.218 --> 32:15.413
There is justice in the world.

32:15.954 --> 32:17.615
What's it called?

32:26.999 --> 32:28.432
<i>The Aquarium.</i>

32:28.500 --> 32:31.833
What a prick! He's advertising.

32:33.872 --> 32:36.432
But why would he pretend to be you?

32:37.376 --> 32:38.866
I think he likes me.

32:38.977 --> 32:41.605
Funny way of showing it.
Can't he send you flowers?

32:41.680 --> 32:44.308
Extraordinary thing, the Internet.

32:44.516 --> 32:47.280
Possibility of genuine
global communication.

32:47.686 --> 32:49.813
The first great democratic medium.

32:49.888 --> 32:52.584
Absolutely. It's the future.

32:52.991 --> 32:55.323
Two guys wanking in cyberspace.

32:55.728 --> 32:57.491
He was the wanker.

32:58.931 --> 33:01.263
I'll say this for him, he can write.

33:02.868 --> 33:04.233
Is he in love with you?

33:04.303 --> 33:06.533
I don't know. No.

33:07.106 --> 33:09.939
- Are you in love with him?
- I hardly know him.

33:10.008 --> 33:12.169
But you're sort of interested.

33:12.311 --> 33:14.643
I think he's interesting.

33:14.947 --> 33:17.415
No, don't. I look like a criminal in photos.

33:17.483 --> 33:19.383
Please. It's my birthday.

33:19.618 --> 33:20.744
Really?

33:21.553 --> 33:22.815
Really.

33:37.202 --> 33:38.499
Happy birthday.

33:41.673 --> 33:42.731
Thank you.

33:43.442 --> 33:46.240
This man comes into the cafÃ© today
and he says:

33:46.311 --> 33:49.405
"Hey, waitress, what are you waiting for?"

33:49.882 --> 33:51.213
Funny guy.

33:51.650 --> 33:55.142
So I go,
"I'm waiting for a man to come in here...

33:55.587 --> 33:59.114
"and fuck me sideways
with a beautiful line like that."

33:59.525 --> 34:01.015
What did he do?

34:01.093 --> 34:03.653
Asked for a cup of tea with two sugars.

34:15.206 --> 34:17.641
- I'm waiting for you.
- To do what?

34:19.844 --> 34:21.176
Leave me.

34:22.147 --> 34:26.014
I'm not going to leave you.
I totally love you. Why is this?

34:27.085 --> 34:30.213
Please let me come.
I want to be there for you.

34:30.889 --> 34:33.755
- Are you ashamed of me?
- Of course not. I told you...

34:33.826 --> 34:36.226
- I want to be alone.
- Why?

34:38.362 --> 34:39.887
To grieve.

34:40.666 --> 34:42.156
To think.

34:44.735 --> 34:47.899
- I love you. Why won't you let me?
- It's only a weekend.

34:48.172 --> 34:50.437
Why won't you let me love you?

34:54.012 --> 34:55.342
Buster.

35:01.286 --> 35:03.151
Let's go to this thing...

35:03.355 --> 35:06.085
then I'll get my train. I'll be away one night.

35:06.425 --> 35:09.087
I'll be back before you know it, okay?

35:38.891 --> 35:41.121
Do these people pay you?
Or do you pay them?

36:07.419 --> 36:08.750
Like it?

36:11.523 --> 36:12.854
No.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.019
What were you so sad about?

36:17.963 --> 36:20.329
- Life.
- What's that, then?

36:23.635 --> 36:26.536
So what do you reckon, in general?

36:26.905 --> 36:28.702
You want to talk about art?

36:28.774 --> 36:32.175
I know it's vulgar to discuss The Work
at an opening of The Work...

36:32.244 --> 36:34.371
but someone's got to do it.

36:36.381 --> 36:38.849
I'm serious. What do you think?

36:40.052 --> 36:41.542
It's a lie.

36:42.220 --> 36:45.849
It's a bunch of sad strangers
photographed beautifully...

36:46.325 --> 36:50.659
and all the glittering assholes
who appreciate art...

36:50.963 --> 36:54.455
say it's beautiful
because that's what they want to see.

36:54.533 --> 36:57.024
But the people in the photos are sad...

36:57.903 --> 36:59.268
and alone.

36:59.338 --> 37:03.001
But the pictures
make the world seem beautiful...

37:03.075 --> 37:07.478
so the exhibition's reassuring,
which makes it a lie.

37:08.013 --> 37:10.675
And everyone loves a big, fat lie.

37:11.116 --> 37:14.677
- I'm the big, fat liar's boyfriend.
- Bastard.

37:14.753 --> 37:16.721
- Larry.
- Alice.

37:19.825 --> 37:21.486
So you're Anna's boyfriend.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.425
A princess can kiss a toad.

37:23.495 --> 37:24.587
- Frog.
- Toad.

37:24.663 --> 37:27.826
- Frog.
- Toad, frog, lobster. They're all the same.

37:29.201 --> 37:31.692
So how long have you been seeing her?

37:31.770 --> 37:34.500
Four months. We're in the first flush.

37:35.207 --> 37:38.870
It's paradise. All my nasty habits amuse her.

37:39.177 --> 37:41.407
- You shouldn't smoke.
- Fuck off.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.040
I'm a doctor.
I'm supposed to say things like that.

37:44.116 --> 37:46.016
- You want one?
- No.

37:46.818 --> 37:48.479
Yes. No.

37:48.854 --> 37:50.549
Fuck it, yes.

37:51.323 --> 37:52.654
No.

37:54.159 --> 37:55.649
I've given up.

37:57.996 --> 38:00.897
Anna tells me your bloke wrote a book.

38:00.966 --> 38:03.662
- Any good?
- Of course.

38:04.269 --> 38:06.260
It's about you, isn't it?

38:06.772 --> 38:09.935
- Some of me.
- Oh? What did he leave out?

38:11.243 --> 38:12.904
The truth.

38:13.845 --> 38:15.540
Is he here, your bloke?

38:15.614 --> 38:18.708
Yeah, he's over there talking to your bird.

38:22.254 --> 38:24.154
My boyfriend's here.

38:25.157 --> 38:26.818
He's here? Where?

38:28.660 --> 38:29.820
There.

38:30.829 --> 38:32.160
With Alice?

38:32.631 --> 38:34.792
I believe you're acquainted.

38:39.104 --> 38:41.902
- I've never seen him before.
- No.

38:43.075 --> 38:44.474
But you've spoken.

38:44.810 --> 38:46.801
Well, conversed.

38:47.679 --> 38:50.239
- Corresponded.
- I wrote to him?

38:51.016 --> 38:55.077
On the Net. You sent him to the aquarium.
I happened to be there.

38:55.821 --> 38:57.618
Nice work, Cupid.

39:01.493 --> 39:04.360
- We need to talk about this.
- No, we don't.

39:04.496 --> 39:06.054
He's very pretty.

39:07.099 --> 39:09.761
She is very tall.

39:14.806 --> 39:16.740
So you're a stripper?

39:17.542 --> 39:18.702
Yeah.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.604
And?

39:43.502 --> 39:45.163
You take care, now.

39:45.537 --> 39:46.834
I will.

39:47.239 --> 39:48.672
You, too.

39:57.082 --> 39:59.573
That's the way it should be.

40:03.221 --> 40:04.711
He's very funny.

40:09.794 --> 40:11.728
Excuse me. Nice to meet you.

40:18.803 --> 40:21.271
- Pleased with the success?
- Yes, absolutely.

40:22.107 --> 40:24.098
Yours was the best.

40:24.576 --> 40:26.601
You were the belle of the bullshit.

40:26.678 --> 40:28.373
Who were those awful people?

40:28.446 --> 40:31.540
- Where do they come from?
- Why should we care?

40:35.687 --> 40:39.123
- You get this one. You'll miss your train.
- I'll be fine.

40:39.658 --> 40:41.148
Come on, it's cold.

40:47.666 --> 40:49.497
I'll see you on Sunday.

40:54.839 --> 40:56.329
Where to, love?

41:00.512 --> 41:01.672
Taxi!

41:12.824 --> 41:13.984
Sorry.

41:14.326 --> 41:16.988
Why don't you make up
your bleeding mind?

41:22.601 --> 41:25.434
Thank you so much.
I appreciate your coming.

41:25.503 --> 41:27.767
I'll call you tomorrow. See you next week.

41:27.839 --> 41:29.773
- Thanks.
- Thanks very much.

41:33.178 --> 41:35.510
- I thought you'd gone.
- I forgot this.

41:37.682 --> 41:41.618
So he's a dermatologist.
Can you get more boring than that?

41:41.686 --> 41:44.655
- Obituarist?
- Failed novelist, please.

41:45.490 --> 41:47.253
I was sorry about your book.

41:47.325 --> 41:49.486
Thanks. I blame the title.

41:49.794 --> 41:52.991
So we pull out our Christmas crackers
with those appalling jokes.

41:53.064 --> 41:55.760
My guy says,
"Hang on. These are second-rate jokes.

41:55.834 --> 41:59.326
"I've got a first-rate joke.
Sit back and take notice."

41:59.404 --> 42:02.202
So we go, "Okay, what's the joke?"
And he says:

42:02.474 --> 42:04.237
"It's based on <i>A Christmas Carol...</i>

42:04.309 --> 42:06.675
"which is why it seems
so relevant on Christmas Day."

42:06.745 --> 42:09.111
I haven't even seen you for a year.

42:09.180 --> 42:10.306
Yes, you have.

42:10.382 --> 42:12.782
Only because you stalk me
outside my studio.

42:12.851 --> 42:14.910
I don't stalk. I lurk.

42:14.986 --> 42:17.181
And when I'm not there you look for me.

42:17.255 --> 42:20.747
- How do you know if you're not there?
- Because I am there...

42:21.426 --> 42:23.121
lurking from a distance.

42:31.803 --> 42:33.134
Look at me.

42:33.872 --> 42:36.033
Tell me you're not in love with me.

42:36.808 --> 42:38.969
I'm not in love with you.

42:41.613 --> 42:43.274
You just lied.

42:49.654 --> 42:52.248
I'm your stranger. Jump.

43:20.618 --> 43:23.382
- Hello, stranger.
- Hello.

43:24.055 --> 43:26.046
Intense conversation?

43:28.426 --> 43:30.257
His father died.

43:31.363 --> 43:32.853
Were you spying?

43:32.931 --> 43:34.796
Lovingly observing...

43:35.066 --> 43:36.624
with a telescope.

43:38.937 --> 43:40.996
He's taller than in his photo.

43:41.606 --> 43:43.437
His photo's a headshot.

43:43.508 --> 43:45.100
Yeah, I know.

43:45.176 --> 43:49.112
But his head implied a short body,
when, in fact, his head is deceptive.

43:49.314 --> 43:50.338
Deceptive?

43:50.415 --> 43:53.816
He's actually got a long body.
He's a stringy fucker.

43:54.953 --> 43:56.511
I could have him.

43:57.489 --> 44:00.981
- What?
- Lf it came to it, in a scrap, I could have him.

44:02.427 --> 44:04.861
Did you tell him we call him Cupid?

44:05.563 --> 44:08.327
No, that's our joke.

44:10.268 --> 44:12.532
I had a chat with young Alice.

44:12.604 --> 44:14.333
- Fancy her?
- Of course.

44:14.439 --> 44:16.168
- Not as much as you.
- Why not?

44:16.241 --> 44:18.209
You're a woman. She's a girl.

44:18.276 --> 44:21.768
She has the moronic beauty of youth,
but she's sly.

44:22.013 --> 44:25.505
- She seems open to me.
- That's how she wants to seem.

44:25.583 --> 44:29.110
You forget you're dealing with
a clinical observer of the human carnival.

44:29.187 --> 44:31.018
- Am I, now?
- Yes.

44:31.089 --> 44:35.025
You seem more like the cat
that got the cream. Stop licking yourself.

44:40.665 --> 44:43.828
That's the nastiest thing
you've ever said to me.

44:47.338 --> 44:48.930
That's horrible.

44:49.174 --> 44:50.641
I'm sorry.

44:52.010 --> 44:53.671
I'm so sorry.

45:41.893 --> 45:44.760
- Where have you been?
- Work thing.

45:45.830 --> 45:48.822
Had a drink with Harry.
You never have one drink with Harry.

45:48.900 --> 45:51.869
- You know he's in love with you.
- No, he's not.

45:52.871 --> 45:54.168
Is he?

45:56.040 --> 45:57.735
Did you eat?

45:58.009 --> 46:00.239
I'll make you something.

46:01.112 --> 46:02.773
I'm not hungry.

46:24.836 --> 46:25.894
What?

46:29.607 --> 46:31.097
This will hurt.

46:32.110 --> 46:33.839
I've been with Anna.

46:34.679 --> 46:36.374
I'm in love with her.

46:37.415 --> 46:40.043
We've been seeing each other for a year.

46:40.385 --> 46:42.353
It began at her opening.

46:58.503 --> 47:00.664
- Have a nice one.
- Cheers, guvnor.

47:23.394 --> 47:24.725
Don't move.

47:25.730 --> 47:27.789
I want to remember this moment forever.

47:27.865 --> 47:31.198
First time I walked through the door,
returning from a business trip...

47:31.269 --> 47:34.067
to be greeted by my wife.

47:34.539 --> 47:37.235
I have, in this moment, become an adult.

47:37.508 --> 47:40.068
Thanks for waiting up, you darling.

47:41.846 --> 47:43.507
You goddess.

47:47.752 --> 47:49.344
I missed you.

47:49.754 --> 47:51.449
How about some tea?

47:51.823 --> 47:53.814
Jesus, I'm knackered!

47:53.891 --> 47:55.916
- Didn't you sleep on the plane?
- No...

47:55.994 --> 48:00.055
because the permed German next to me
was snoring like a Messerschmitt.

48:00.131 --> 48:02.531
- What's the time?
- About midnight.

48:02.667 --> 48:05.101
Time. What a tricky little fucker.

48:05.837 --> 48:09.170
My head's in two places.
My brain actually hurts.

48:09.240 --> 48:12.232
- Do you want some food?
- No, I need a bath.

48:12.677 --> 48:15.805
- I'll run it for you.
- No, I'll have a shower.

48:16.180 --> 48:17.511
You okay?

48:18.249 --> 48:19.648
How was the thing?

48:19.717 --> 48:22.880
As dermatological conferences go,
it was a riot.

48:23.788 --> 48:25.380
How was the hotel?

48:25.723 --> 48:29.352
Someone told me that
the beautiful people of the Paranoid Hotel...

48:29.427 --> 48:33.363
the concierge, the bellboys and girls...
Did you know this?

48:33.665 --> 48:36.463
- They're all whores.
- Everybody knows that.

48:37.135 --> 48:38.295
I didn't.

48:40.905 --> 48:43.897
I don't suppose you'd fancy a friendly poke.

48:44.342 --> 48:46.003
I just had a bath.

48:47.545 --> 48:48.876
Right.

48:49.514 --> 48:52.449
I'll see to myself, then,
in the Elle Decoration bathroom.

48:52.517 --> 48:56.044
- You chose that bathroom.
- And every time I wash in it I feel dirty.

48:56.120 --> 48:58.554
It's cleaner than I am. It's got attitude.

48:58.623 --> 49:00.591
The mirror says, "Who the fuck are you?"

49:00.658 --> 49:03.320
- You chose it.
- Doesn't mean I like it.

49:03.494 --> 49:05.359
We shouldn't have this.

49:05.430 --> 49:07.261
I hear middle-class guilt.

49:07.331 --> 49:11.267
Working-class guilt.
Why are you dressed if you just had a bath?

49:12.837 --> 49:14.532
We needed some milk.

49:15.640 --> 49:16.868
You okay?

49:17.909 --> 49:19.638
- You?
- Yeah.

49:23.881 --> 49:25.212
I'm going.

49:25.550 --> 49:27.882
- I'm sorry.
- Irrelevant.

49:29.087 --> 49:30.918
What are you sorry for?

49:31.222 --> 49:32.712
Everything.

49:32.924 --> 49:35.916
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- Cowardice.

49:37.795 --> 49:39.592
Is it because she's successful?

49:39.664 --> 49:42.827
No, it's because she doesn't need me.

49:46.270 --> 49:47.931
Did you bring her here?

49:50.341 --> 49:51.330
Yes.

49:55.279 --> 49:58.373
- Didn't she get married?
- She stopped seeing me.

49:58.950 --> 50:01.043
Is that when we went to the country?

50:01.119 --> 50:03.781
To celebrate our third anniversary?

50:05.490 --> 50:08.618
Did you phone her? Beg her to come back?

50:09.193 --> 50:11.855
- When you went for your long, Ionely walks?
- Yes.

50:11.929 --> 50:13.294
You're a piece of shit.

50:13.364 --> 50:16.390
Deception is brutal.
I'm not pretending otherwise.

50:16.467 --> 50:17.627
How?

50:17.935 --> 50:19.425
How does it work?

50:20.938 --> 50:23.099
How do you do this to someone?

50:24.876 --> 50:26.537
Not good enough.

50:27.845 --> 50:31.212
- I fell in love with her, Alice.
- As if you had no choice?

50:31.282 --> 50:33.216
There's a moment. There's always a moment.

50:33.284 --> 50:36.447
"I can do this, I can give in to this,
or I can resist it."

50:36.521 --> 50:40.514
And I don't know when your moment was,
but I bet you there was one.

50:40.591 --> 50:42.024
I'm going.

50:44.796 --> 50:47.230
- It's not safe out there.
- And it's safe in here?

50:47.298 --> 50:49.163
What about your things?

50:49.433 --> 50:52.163
- I don't need things.
- Where will you go?

50:52.436 --> 50:53.767
Disappear.

50:56.607 --> 50:59.440
The Sultan has returned bearing gifts.

51:02.446 --> 51:03.777
Thank you.

51:09.120 --> 51:10.485
They're beautiful.

51:10.555 --> 51:13.456
Here's a thing. Alice was at the hotel.

51:14.225 --> 51:15.214
What?

51:15.359 --> 51:18.157
They sell these arty postcards in the lobby.

51:18.429 --> 51:20.863
I bought one to boost your sales.

51:23.100 --> 51:25.762
"Young Woman, London."

51:27.205 --> 51:32.006
And I checked for your book
in The Museum of Modern Art. It was there.

51:32.977 --> 51:34.672
Someone bought one.

51:34.879 --> 51:37.541
This guy with a ridiculous little beard.

51:37.615 --> 51:42.279
He was drooling over your photo on
the inside cover. He fancied you, the geek.

51:42.486 --> 51:45.649
I was so proud of you.
You've broken New York.

51:46.324 --> 51:47.814
You're wonderful.

51:48.960 --> 51:50.791
Don't ever forget it.

51:54.699 --> 51:56.530
Can I still see you?

52:01.038 --> 52:04.007
Dan, can I still see you? Answer me.

52:04.075 --> 52:06.805
I can't see you.
If I see you, I'll never leave you.

52:06.878 --> 52:10.279
- What will you do if I find someone else?
- Be jealous.

52:12.149 --> 52:14.140
You still fancy me?

52:15.052 --> 52:16.383
Of course.

52:17.321 --> 52:18.618
You're lying.

52:19.891 --> 52:21.449
I've been you.

52:24.562 --> 52:26.223
Will you hold me?

52:32.103 --> 52:35.630
- I amuse you, but I bore you.
- No.

52:37.041 --> 52:38.906
You did love me?

52:39.810 --> 52:42.472
I'll always love you. I hate hurting you.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.238
Then why are you?

52:45.483 --> 52:47.417
'Cause I'm selfish.

52:47.885 --> 52:51.116
- And I think I'll be happier with her.
- You won't.

52:51.789 --> 52:53.620
You'll miss me.

52:54.625 --> 52:57.389
No one will ever love you as much as I do.

52:58.696 --> 53:00.857
Why isn't love enough?

53:02.266 --> 53:05.929
I'm the one who leaves.
I'm supposed to leave you.

53:20.952 --> 53:23.011
Make some tea, buster.

54:14.038 --> 54:15.733
Why are you dressed?

54:19.176 --> 54:21.542
Because I think
you might be about to leave me...

54:21.612 --> 54:24.672
and I didn't want to be wearing
a dressing gown.

54:27.585 --> 54:29.917
I slept with someone in New York.

54:31.155 --> 54:32.486
A whore.

54:33.824 --> 54:35.121
I'm sorry.

54:39.497 --> 54:41.328
Why did you tell me?

54:42.266 --> 54:45.064
- I couldn't lie to you.
- Why not?

54:46.404 --> 54:48.065
Because I love you.

55:03.821 --> 55:05.152
It's fine.

55:06.023 --> 55:08.014
Really? Why?

55:13.097 --> 55:14.792
Something's wrong.

55:19.236 --> 55:20.567
Tell me.

55:24.075 --> 55:25.906
Are you leaving me?

55:30.314 --> 55:31.975
Because of this?

55:34.652 --> 55:35.812
Why?

55:37.922 --> 55:39.253
Dan.

55:41.325 --> 55:42.622
Cupid?

55:44.462 --> 55:46.054
He's our joke.

55:47.031 --> 55:48.362
I love him.

55:49.767 --> 55:51.701
You're seeing him now?

55:54.071 --> 55:55.663
Since when?

56:01.212 --> 56:04.045
Since my opening last year.

56:05.416 --> 56:06.974
I'm disgusting.

56:09.653 --> 56:11.245
You're phenomenal.

56:12.857 --> 56:14.518
You're so clever.

56:16.927 --> 56:18.690
Why did you marry me?

56:20.397 --> 56:22.888
I stopped seeing him. I wanted us to work.

56:22.967 --> 56:25.959
- Why did you tell me you wanted children?
- Because I did.

56:26.036 --> 56:28.869
- And now you want children with him?
- Yes.

56:31.008 --> 56:32.566
I don't know.

56:36.080 --> 56:37.604
But we're happy...

56:38.816 --> 56:40.147
aren't we?

56:45.422 --> 56:48.084
- You're gonna go live with him?
- You stay here if you want.

56:48.159 --> 56:50.753
I don't give a fuck about the spoils.

56:52.163 --> 56:55.860
You did this to me the day we met.
You let me hang myself for your amusement.

56:55.933 --> 56:58.424
Why didn't you just tell me
when I walked in the door?

56:58.502 --> 57:01.665
- I was scared.
- You're a coward, you spoilt bitch.

57:03.807 --> 57:07.004
Are you dressed
because you thought I might hit you?

57:09.613 --> 57:11.205
What do you think I am?

57:11.282 --> 57:13.682
- I've been hit before.
- Not by me.

57:16.387 --> 57:18.116
Is he a good fuck?

57:19.623 --> 57:21.147
Don't do this.

57:21.625 --> 57:23.616
Just answer the question.

57:23.861 --> 57:25.522
Is he good?

57:25.863 --> 57:27.194
Yes.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.292
Better than me?

57:31.635 --> 57:33.694
- Different.
- Better?

57:36.407 --> 57:38.739
- Gentler.
- What does that mean?

57:39.610 --> 57:41.703
- You know what it means.
- Tell me.

57:41.779 --> 57:43.337
- No.
- I treat you like a whore?

57:43.414 --> 57:45.644
- Sometimes.
- Why would that be?

57:46.684 --> 57:49.084
- I'm sorry, you're...
- Don't say it.

57:49.320 --> 57:50.947
Don't you fucking say:

57:51.021 --> 57:53.819
"You're too good for me."
I am, but don't say it.

57:53.891 --> 57:56.553
You're making the mistake of your life.

57:58.362 --> 58:01.854
You're leaving me because you believe
that you don't deserve happiness...

58:01.932 --> 58:03.524
but you do, Anna.

58:06.470 --> 58:09.496
Did you have a bath
because you had sex with him?

58:10.241 --> 58:12.368
So you wouldn't smell of him?

58:13.777 --> 58:15.938
So you'd feel less guilty?

58:17.114 --> 58:18.706
How do you feel?

58:19.383 --> 58:20.873
Guilty.

58:22.353 --> 58:24.184
Did you ever love me?

58:25.055 --> 58:26.215
Yes.

58:58.822 --> 59:00.653
Did you do it here?

59:02.960 --> 59:04.120
No.

59:04.561 --> 59:05.892
Why not?

59:08.365 --> 59:10.128
Do you wish we did?

59:10.200 --> 59:11.997
Just tell me the truth.

59:13.904 --> 59:15.735
Yes, we did it here.

59:18.742 --> 59:19.902
Where?

59:24.948 --> 59:26.108
There.

59:28.652 --> 59:29.983
On this?

59:34.191 --> 59:36.489
We had our first fuck on this.

59:37.294 --> 59:38.989
Did you think of me?

59:41.832 --> 59:43.163
When?

59:46.236 --> 59:48.136
When did you do it here?

59:48.472 --> 59:50.997
- Answer the question!
- This evening.

59:55.813 --> 59:57.246
Did you come?

59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.510
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I want to know.

01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:05.917
- Yes, I came.
- How many times?

01:00:05.989 --> 01:00:07.854
- Twice.
- How?

01:00:08.392 --> 01:00:11.987
- First he went down on me, then we fucked.
- Who was where?

01:00:12.062 --> 01:00:14.997
I was on top,
then he fucked me from behind.

01:00:15.065 --> 01:00:17.932
- That's when you came the second time?
- God.

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:22.502
- Why is the sex so important?
- Because I'm a fucking caveman!

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.133
Did you touch yourself
while he fucked you?

01:00:25.509 --> 01:00:27.033
- You wank for him?
- Sometimes.

01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:28.976
- And he does?
- We do everything...

01:00:29.046 --> 01:00:31.776
- that people who have sex do.
- You enjoy sucking him off?

01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:33.077
- You like his cock?
- I love it.

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:34.674
- Like him coming in your face?
- Yes!

01:00:34.752 --> 01:00:37.220
- What does it taste like?
- Like you, but sweeter.

01:00:37.287 --> 01:00:40.745
That's the spirit. Thank you.
Thank you for your honesty.

01:00:40.824 --> 01:00:42.792
Now fuck off and die...

01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:45.626
you fucked-up slag.

01:02:09.012 --> 01:02:10.604
I love you.

01:02:12.449 --> 01:02:13.939
Thank you.

01:02:16.286 --> 01:02:19.778
- What's this room called?
- The Paradise Suite.

01:02:20.057 --> 01:02:22.992
- How many Paradise Suites are there?
- Eight.

01:02:28.799 --> 01:02:30.460
Do I have to pay you to talk to me?

01:02:30.534 --> 01:02:33.435
No. But if you want to tip me,
you're welcome.

01:02:38.609 --> 01:02:39.906
Thank you.

01:02:41.044 --> 01:02:44.707
I used to come here a million years ago.
It was a punk club.

01:02:44.915 --> 01:02:46.780
The stage was...

01:02:50.087 --> 01:02:52.749
Everything is a version of something else.

01:02:53.056 --> 01:02:54.683
Twenty years ago.

01:02:55.058 --> 01:02:56.423
How old were you?

01:02:56.527 --> 01:02:58.358
- Four.
- Christ.

01:02:58.562 --> 01:03:02.658
- When I was in flares, you were in nappies.
- My nappies were flared.

01:03:02.733 --> 01:03:05.327
- You have the face of an angel.
- Thank you.

01:03:05.402 --> 01:03:07.632
What does your cunt taste like?

01:03:07.938 --> 01:03:09.269
Heaven.

01:03:13.377 --> 01:03:14.935
How long have you been doing this?

01:03:15.012 --> 01:03:17.708
- Three months.
- Straight after he left you?

01:03:18.248 --> 01:03:19.977
No one left me.

01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:24.016
- Nice wig.
- Thank you.

01:03:24.955 --> 01:03:27.014
Does all this turn you on?

01:03:27.124 --> 01:03:28.421
- Sometimes.
- Liar.

01:03:28.492 --> 01:03:31.518
You're telling me that
'cause you think it's what I want to hear.

01:03:31.595 --> 01:03:33.495
You think I'm turned on
by it turning you on.

01:03:33.564 --> 01:03:37.864
The thought of me creaming myself when
I strip for strangers doesn't turn you on?

01:03:37.935 --> 01:03:39.926
Put like that, yes.

01:03:43.206 --> 01:03:45.834
- Are you flirting with me?
- Maybe.

01:03:46.843 --> 01:03:49.004
- Are you allowed to flirt with me?
- Sure.

01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:51.639
- Really?
- No, I'm not. I'm breaking all the rules.

01:03:51.715 --> 01:03:54.309
- You're mocking me.
- Yes, I'm allowed to flirt.

01:03:54.384 --> 01:03:55.681
To prize my money from me.

01:03:55.752 --> 01:03:58.915
To prize your money from you,
I may do or say as I please.

01:03:58.989 --> 01:04:00.854
- Except touch.
- We're not allowed to touch.

01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:02.255
Open your legs.

01:04:03.026 --> 01:04:04.254
Wider.

01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:16.002
Show me.

01:04:21.345 --> 01:04:23.472
So what would happen
if I touched you now?

01:04:23.547 --> 01:04:25.708
- I'd call security.
- What would they do?

01:04:25.782 --> 01:04:28.307
They would ask you to leave
and not to come back.

01:04:28.385 --> 01:04:30.853
- And if I refused to leave?
- They would remove you.

01:04:30.921 --> 01:04:33.651
Those are security cameras in the ceiling.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.690
I think it's best I don't attempt to touch you.

01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:43.161
I'd like to touch you. Later.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.700
- I'm not a whore.
- I wouldn't pay.

01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:49.735
Why the fuck did he leave you?

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.636
- What's your job?
- A question. You asked me a question.

01:04:52.709 --> 01:04:54.438
- So?
- It's a chink in your armor.

01:04:54.511 --> 01:04:56.945
- I'm not wearing armor.
- Yes, you are.

01:04:57.014 --> 01:04:59.847
- Why are you calling yourself Jane?
- Because it's my name.

01:04:59.916 --> 01:05:01.781
We both know it isn't.

01:05:03.086 --> 01:05:05.054
You're all protecting your identities.

01:05:05.122 --> 01:05:08.785
There's a girl out there who calls
herself Venus. What's her real name?

01:05:08.859 --> 01:05:11.327
- Pluto.
- You're cheeky.

01:05:11.428 --> 01:05:14.329
- Would you like me to stop being cheeky?
- No.

01:05:15.232 --> 01:05:16.756
What's your name?

01:05:18.235 --> 01:05:19.361
Daniel.

01:05:20.671 --> 01:05:22.332
Daniel the dermatologist.

01:05:22.406 --> 01:05:24.738
- I never told you my job.
- I guessed.

01:05:25.075 --> 01:05:26.633
You're strong.

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:30.805
There's another one out there.
Judging by the scars, a patient of Dr. Tit.

01:05:30.881 --> 01:05:33.577
Calls herself Cupid.
Who's gonna tell her he was a bloke?

01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:37.916
- He wasn't a bloke. He was a little boy.
- I want you to tell me your name.

01:05:43.226 --> 01:05:44.454
Please.

01:05:45.762 --> 01:05:48.560
Thank you. My name is Jane.

01:05:49.332 --> 01:05:50.697
Your real name.

01:05:52.402 --> 01:05:53.733
Thank you.

01:05:54.404 --> 01:05:57.134
- My real name is Jane.
- Careful.

01:06:00.811 --> 01:06:03.473
Thank you. Still Jane.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.739
I've got about another Â£500 here.

01:06:05.816 --> 01:06:10.753
Why don't I just give you all this money
and you tell me what your real name is...

01:06:11.588 --> 01:06:12.782
Alice?

01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:14.957
I promise.

01:06:16.393 --> 01:06:17.724
Thank you.

01:06:18.962 --> 01:06:20.554
My real name...

01:06:20.731 --> 01:06:23.427
is plain Jane Jones.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.297
I may be rich, but I'm not stupid.

01:06:25.368 --> 01:06:27.632
What a shame, Doc.
I love them rich and stupid.

01:06:27.704 --> 01:06:29.865
Don't you fuck around with me.

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.500
- I apologize.
- Accepted.

01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:36.512
All the girls in this hellhole,
the pneumatic robots...

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.071
the coked-up baby dolls,
and you're no different.

01:06:39.182 --> 01:06:42.242
You all use stage names
to con yourselves you're someone else...

01:06:42.319 --> 01:06:45.777
so you don't feel ashamed showing
your cunts and assholes to strangers.

01:06:45.856 --> 01:06:47.323
I'm trying to have a conversation.

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:49.255
- You're out of cash.
- I paid for this room.

01:06:49.326 --> 01:06:50.384
This is extra.

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.018
- We met last year.
- Wrong girl.

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:53.426
Talk to me!

01:06:54.064 --> 01:06:56.624
- I am.
- Talk to me in real life.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.236
I didn't know you'd be here.
I know who you are.

01:07:01.505 --> 01:07:02.904
I love you.

01:07:04.407 --> 01:07:06.932
I love everything about you that hurts.

01:07:19.923 --> 01:07:21.891
She won't even see me.

01:07:23.226 --> 01:07:26.992
- You feel the same. I know it.
- You can't cry in here.

01:07:27.898 --> 01:07:31.334
- Hold me. Let me hold you.
- We're not allowed to touch.

01:07:32.435 --> 01:07:35.268
Come home with me. It's safe.
Let me look after you.

01:07:35.338 --> 01:07:38.068
- I don't need looking after.
- Everyone needs looking after.

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:40.109
I'm not your revenge fuck.

01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.873
- I'll pay you.
- I don't need your money.

01:07:42.946 --> 01:07:44.208
- You have my money.
- Thank you.

01:07:44.281 --> 01:07:47.808
- "Thank you." Is that some kind of rule?
- Just being polite.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.553
Do you get a lot of grown men
crying their guts out here?

01:07:53.623 --> 01:07:55.591
Occupational hazard.

01:07:55.692 --> 01:07:58.126
Have you ever desired a customer?

01:07:59.563 --> 01:08:00.825
Yes.

01:08:00.897 --> 01:08:03.092
Then put me out of my misery.
Do you desire me?

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:05.760
Because I'm being pretty honest
about my feelings for you.

01:08:05.836 --> 01:08:08.066
- Your feelings?
- Whatever.

01:08:08.405 --> 01:08:10.305
No, I don't desire you.

01:08:11.575 --> 01:08:12.940
Thank you.

01:08:13.877 --> 01:08:16.640
Thank you sincerely for your honesty.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.281
You think you haven't give us
anything of yourselves?

01:08:27.357 --> 01:08:30.087
Do you think because you don't love us
or desire us...

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.754
or even like us, you think you've won?

01:08:32.828 --> 01:08:34.319
It's not a war.

01:08:40.569 --> 01:08:42.868
If I asked you to strip right now, would you?

01:08:42.939 --> 01:08:45.600
- Of course. Do you want me to?
- No.

01:08:47.243 --> 01:08:50.304
Alice, tell me something true.

01:08:51.247 --> 01:08:55.344
Lying is the most fun a girl can have
without taking her clothes off...

01:08:55.919 --> 01:08:58.080
but it's better if you do.

01:08:59.856 --> 01:09:01.255
You're cold.

01:09:01.892 --> 01:09:03.917
You're all cold at heart.

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:08.788
What do you have to do
to get a bit of intimacy around here?

01:09:08.865 --> 01:09:11.925
Maybe next time
I'll have worked on my intimacy.

01:09:12.335 --> 01:09:16.499
No, I'll tell you what's gonna work.
You're gonna take your gear off right now.

01:09:16.573 --> 01:09:21.033
You're gonna turn around very slowly,
and you're gonna bend over...

01:09:21.611 --> 01:09:25.877
and you're gonna touch the fucking floor
for my viewing pleasure.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.684
Is that what you want?

01:09:30.086 --> 01:09:31.986
What else could I want?

01:10:39.055 --> 01:10:40.386
I'm sorry.

01:10:42.726 --> 01:10:44.717
- What happened?
- Traffic.

01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:50.197
- Do you want to go stand in the back?
- No, let's have a drink.

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:55.967
You look flushed.

01:10:57.073 --> 01:10:59.041
You have no need to run.

01:10:59.109 --> 01:11:00.633
- Vodka tonic?
- Yes.

01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:03.907
- Vodka tonic and a Guinness, please.
- Sure.

01:11:05.148 --> 01:11:06.581
How was it?

01:11:07.784 --> 01:11:08.944
Fine.

01:11:09.519 --> 01:11:10.986
You had lunch?

01:11:11.688 --> 01:11:12.985
Then what?

01:11:14.758 --> 01:11:17.249
- And then we left.
- And?

01:11:18.128 --> 01:11:19.720
There's no "and."

01:11:22.232 --> 01:11:25.929
You haven't seen him in four months.
There must be an "and."

01:11:26.236 --> 01:11:28.670
- How is he?
- Terrible.

01:11:37.414 --> 01:11:39.678
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

01:11:43.753 --> 01:11:45.744
How is his dermatology?

01:11:45.955 --> 01:11:49.721
- He's in private practice now.
- Is he?

01:11:52.295 --> 01:11:54.695
Was he weeping all over the place?

01:11:54.798 --> 01:11:58.029
- Some of the time.
- Poor bastard.

01:11:58.701 --> 01:12:01.261
Was he difficult?

01:12:03.807 --> 01:12:05.968
Are you angry that I saw him?

01:12:06.109 --> 01:12:07.770
No. It's just...

01:12:09.145 --> 01:12:10.737
I haven't seen Alice.

01:12:10.814 --> 01:12:13.442
You can't see Alice.
You don't know where she is.

01:12:13.516 --> 01:12:15.643
I haven't tried to find her.

01:12:17.053 --> 01:12:18.418
You know why I saw him.

01:12:18.488 --> 01:12:21.252
He's been begging me for months.
I saw him so he'd sign.

01:12:21.324 --> 01:12:23.554
- So has he signed?
- Yes.

01:12:27.997 --> 01:12:29.555
Congratulations.

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:32.264
You're a divorcÃ©e.

01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:35.499
Double divorcÃ©e.

01:12:37.507 --> 01:12:38.804
Sorry.

01:12:39.843 --> 01:12:41.367
How do you feel?

01:12:42.579 --> 01:12:43.739
Tired.

01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:49.282
I love you.

01:12:50.019 --> 01:12:51.748
And I need a piss.

01:13:28.691 --> 01:13:30.215
I hate this place.

01:13:31.261 --> 01:13:32.660
At least it's central.

01:13:32.729 --> 01:13:35.789
I hate central.
Central London's a theme park.

01:13:36.766 --> 01:13:41.100
I hate retro. I hate the future.
Where does that leave me?

01:13:42.205 --> 01:13:43.502
Come back.

01:13:44.274 --> 01:13:47.107
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Come back.

01:13:51.447 --> 01:13:54.507
- How's work?
- Jesus. Work's shit, okay?

01:14:03.193 --> 01:14:07.061
Do they have waiters here?
I love you. Please come back.

01:14:07.964 --> 01:14:09.693
I'm not coming back.

01:14:15.605 --> 01:14:16.697
Sign.

01:14:17.907 --> 01:14:19.169
No pen.

01:14:24.681 --> 01:14:25.739
Pen.

01:14:28.751 --> 01:14:30.548
Give me back my hand.

01:14:40.163 --> 01:14:41.255
Sign.

01:14:47.837 --> 01:14:49.930
I'll sign on one condition.

01:14:51.774 --> 01:14:55.005
We skip this.
We go to my sleek new surgery...

01:14:55.078 --> 01:14:58.241
and we christen the patients' bed
with our final fuck.

01:14:58.314 --> 01:15:00.214
I know you don't want to...

01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:04.677
and I know you think I'm sick for asking,
but that's what I'm asking.

01:15:04.754 --> 01:15:06.449
For old times' sake.

01:15:07.257 --> 01:15:09.384
Because I'm obsessed with you.

01:15:10.093 --> 01:15:12.789
Because I can't get over you unless...

01:15:13.596 --> 01:15:15.427
Because I think, on some small level...

01:15:15.498 --> 01:15:18.797
you owe me something
for deceiving me so exquisitely.

01:15:19.736 --> 01:15:24.105
For all these reasons,
I am begging you to give me your body.

01:15:26.009 --> 01:15:27.772
You'd be my whore.

01:15:28.311 --> 01:15:31.178
And in return,
I will pay you with your liberty.

01:15:33.116 --> 01:15:36.415
You do this,
I swear I will not contact you again.

01:15:41.591 --> 01:15:43.422
I'm going to the bar.

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:46.551
I assume you still drink vodka tonic?

01:16:08.951 --> 01:16:11.146
You slept with him, didn't you?

01:16:37.647 --> 01:16:40.445
- What do you expect me to do?
- Understand.

01:16:41.718 --> 01:16:43.185
Why didn't you lie to me?

01:16:43.252 --> 01:16:45.846
Because we said
we'd always tell each other the truth.

01:16:45.922 --> 01:16:47.514
What's so great about the truth?

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:50.889
Try lying for a change.
It's the currency of the world.

01:16:53.096 --> 01:16:57.795
I did what he wanted,
and now he will leave us alone.

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:02.235
I love you.

01:17:03.439 --> 01:17:06.306
- I didn't give him anything.
- Your body?

01:17:08.111 --> 01:17:11.603
If Alice came to you, desperate...

01:17:12.081 --> 01:17:14.174
with all that love still between you...

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:16.309
and she said she needed you to want her...

01:17:16.386 --> 01:17:18.479
so she could get over you, you'd do it.

01:17:18.554 --> 01:17:21.546
I wouldn't like it either, but I'd forgive you.

01:17:21.858 --> 01:17:24.986
- It's kindness.
- No, cowardice.

01:17:25.194 --> 01:17:27.389
You haven't got the guts to let him hate you.

01:17:39.475 --> 01:17:43.206
I'm doing this because I feel guilty,
and because I pity you.

01:17:43.279 --> 01:17:46.180
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

01:17:47.016 --> 01:17:49.883
- Feel good about yourself?
- No.

01:18:00.263 --> 01:18:01.628
It's gone.

01:18:02.665 --> 01:18:06.795
- We're not innocent anymore.
- Don't stop loving me.

01:18:06.869 --> 01:18:10.361
I can see it draining out of you.
It's me, remember?

01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:14.234
It was a stupid thing to do,
and it meant nothing.

01:18:14.644 --> 01:18:16.908
If you love me enough, you'll forgive me.

01:18:16.979 --> 01:18:19.379
- Are you testing me?
- No.

01:18:19.982 --> 01:18:23.884
- I do understand.
- No. He understands.

01:18:26.155 --> 01:18:29.318
All I can see is him all over you.

01:18:29.992 --> 01:18:33.393
He's clever, your ex-husband.

01:18:34.897 --> 01:18:36.421
I almost admire him.

01:18:40.369 --> 01:18:42.360
You going to tell him?

01:18:43.973 --> 01:18:45.463
I don't know.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:00.848
Better to be truthful about this kind of thing.

01:19:08.164 --> 01:19:09.358
Sign.

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.430
I forgive you.

01:19:22.879 --> 01:19:24.210
Sign.

01:19:28.017 --> 01:19:29.917
<i>I think you enjoyed it.</i>

01:19:30.953 --> 01:19:34.480
He wheedles you into bed. The old jokes...

01:19:34.557 --> 01:19:38.516
the strange familiarity.
I think you had a whale of a time.

01:19:38.594 --> 01:19:40.926
And the truth is I'll never know
unless I ask him.

01:19:40.997 --> 01:19:42.521
Why don't you?

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.172
Yes?

01:20:33.849 --> 01:20:35.646
You can go in now.

01:20:43.259 --> 01:20:46.160
- I want Anna back.
- She's made her choice.

01:20:46.228 --> 01:20:50.824
I owe you an apology. I fell in love with her.
My intention was not to make you suffer.

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:53.960
So where's the apology? You cunt.

01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:57.896
I apologize.
If you love her, you'll let her go...

01:20:57.974 --> 01:20:59.601
so she can be happy.

01:20:59.675 --> 01:21:02.473
- She doesn't want to be happy.
- Everybody wants to be happy.

01:21:02.545 --> 01:21:05.946
Depressives don't. They want to be unhappy
to confirm they're depressed.

01:21:06.015 --> 01:21:08.210
If they were happy,
they couldn't be depressed.

01:21:08.284 --> 01:21:11.742
They'd have to go out into the world
and live, which can be depressing.

01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:14.289
- Anna's not a depressive.
- Isn't she?

01:21:14.357 --> 01:21:17.417
- I love her.
- Boo-hoo. So do I.

01:21:17.827 --> 01:21:20.625
She's gone back to you
because she can't bear your suffering.

01:21:20.696 --> 01:21:22.425
You don't know who she is.

01:21:22.498 --> 01:21:27.094
- You love her like a dog loves its owner.
- And the owner loves the dog for so doing.

01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:29.194
You'll hurt her. You'll never forgive her.

01:21:29.271 --> 01:21:31.364
Of course I forgive her. I have forgiven her.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:34.705
Without forgiveness we're savages.
You're drowning.

01:21:34.777 --> 01:21:37.871
- You only met her because of me.
- Yeah. Thanks.

01:21:37.947 --> 01:21:40.108
It's a joke. Your marriage is a joke.

01:21:40.182 --> 01:21:43.674
Here's a good one. She never sent
the divorce papers to her lawyer.

01:21:43.753 --> 01:21:48.656
Now, to a towering romantic hero like you,
I don't doubt I am somewhat common.

01:21:48.724 --> 01:21:51.022
But I am, nevertheless,
what she has chosen...

01:21:51.093 --> 01:21:53.857
and we must respect what the woman wants.

01:21:54.964 --> 01:21:58.331
If you go near her again, I swear...

01:21:59.301 --> 01:22:01.030
I will kill you.

01:22:05.374 --> 01:22:08.502
Okay. I have patients to see.

01:22:08.577 --> 01:22:10.772
When she came here,
do you think she enjoyed it?

01:22:10.846 --> 01:22:13.474
I didn't do it to give her a nice time.

01:22:13.549 --> 01:22:15.710
I fucked her to fuck you up.

01:22:16.218 --> 01:22:19.813
A good fight is never clean.
And of course she enjoyed it.

01:22:19.889 --> 01:22:22.483
As you know, she loves a guilty fuck.

01:22:22.558 --> 01:22:25.220
- You're an animal.
- Yeah? What are you?

01:22:25.294 --> 01:22:28.388
You think love is simple.
You think the heart is like a diagram.

01:22:28.464 --> 01:22:32.093
Have you ever seen a human heart?
It looks like a fist wrapped in blood!

01:22:32.168 --> 01:22:35.194
Go fuck yourself. You writer!

01:22:35.604 --> 01:22:36.969
You liar!

01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:39.473
You go check a few facts
while I get my hands dirty.

01:22:39.542 --> 01:22:42.136
She hates your hands.
She hates your simplicity.

01:22:42.211 --> 01:22:44.577
I spent the whole of last week
talking about you.

01:22:44.647 --> 01:22:48.048
I know all your ways. Anna says
you fucked her with your eyes closed.

01:22:48.117 --> 01:22:52.349
She tells me you wake in the night
crying for your mother, you mommy's boy.

01:22:52.421 --> 01:22:53.945
I could go on.

01:22:56.092 --> 01:22:57.787
Shall we stop this?

01:23:03.466 --> 01:23:06.458
It's over. Accept it.

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:14.509
You don't know the first thing about love...

01:23:14.944 --> 01:23:17.572
because you don't understand compromise.

01:23:26.288 --> 01:23:29.052
- Don't cry on me.
- I'm sorry.

01:23:31.894 --> 01:23:33.919
I don't know what to do.

01:23:34.597 --> 01:23:37.760
You want my advice? You go back to Alice.

01:23:40.803 --> 01:23:42.532
She'd never have me.

01:23:44.373 --> 01:23:46.967
- She's vanished.
- No, she hasn't.

01:23:47.243 --> 01:23:49.211
I found her, by accident.

01:23:49.678 --> 01:23:51.873
She's working in a club.

01:23:53.048 --> 01:23:55.380
Yes, I saw her naked.

01:23:56.218 --> 01:23:58.209
No, I did not fuck her.

01:23:59.188 --> 01:24:00.849
You spoke to her?

01:24:05.694 --> 01:24:07.924
Yes, I know. One minute.

01:24:09.398 --> 01:24:10.865
How is she?

01:24:11.367 --> 01:24:13.028
She loves you...

01:24:13.736 --> 01:24:15.761
beyond comprehension.

01:24:17.072 --> 01:24:18.801
Your prescription.

01:24:19.975 --> 01:24:21.840
It's where she works.

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.779
Go to her.

01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:28.480
Thank you.

01:24:32.254 --> 01:24:34.745
You still pissing about on the Net?

01:24:36.058 --> 01:24:37.525
Not recently.

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:41.452
- I wanted to kill you.
- I thought you wanted to fuck me.

01:24:41.697 --> 01:24:43.289
Don't get lippy.

01:24:45.201 --> 01:24:47.431
I liked your book, by the way.

01:24:47.703 --> 01:24:50.797
Thanks. You stand alone.

01:24:51.006 --> 01:24:52.496
With Anna.

01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:58.476
- You still writing obituaries? Busy?
- I was made editor.

01:24:58.714 --> 01:25:01.649
- Yeah? How come?
- Previous editor died.

01:25:05.287 --> 01:25:09.189
Alcohol poisoning.
I sat with him for a week in the hospital.

01:25:11.493 --> 01:25:13.927
I really do have patients to see.

01:25:15.998 --> 01:25:18.489
- Thank you.
- For what?

01:25:19.802 --> 01:25:22.270
- Being kind.
- I am kind.

01:25:22.738 --> 01:25:24.865
Your invoice is in the post.

01:25:38.687 --> 01:25:40.154
I lied to you.

01:25:41.557 --> 01:25:43.218
I did fuck Alice.

01:25:45.895 --> 01:25:49.854
Sorry for telling you.
I'm just not big enough to forgive you.

01:25:52.268 --> 01:25:53.599
Buster.

01:26:24.633 --> 01:26:26.430
Show me the sneer.

01:26:29.471 --> 01:26:31.098
Beautiful.

01:26:31.173 --> 01:26:33.004
You'll wake up the hotel.

01:26:39.682 --> 01:26:41.081
Fuck me.

01:26:42.318 --> 01:26:44.616
Again? We have to get up at 6:00.

01:26:44.687 --> 01:26:48.054
How can one man
be so endlessly disappointing?

01:26:48.123 --> 01:26:49.590
That's my charm.

01:26:50.793 --> 01:26:53.489
So where are we going?

01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:55.662
- My treat.
- Where are we going?

01:26:55.731 --> 01:26:58.325
My holiday surprise. My rules.

01:26:58.534 --> 01:27:00.695
Where are we going?

01:27:01.971 --> 01:27:04.371
New York.

01:27:06.575 --> 01:27:08.133
You angel.

01:27:09.845 --> 01:27:13.747
- You did remember to pack my passport?
- Of course. It's with my passport.

01:27:13.816 --> 01:27:15.078
And where's that?

01:27:15.150 --> 01:27:19.109
In a place where you can't look.
No one sees my passport picture.

01:27:24.226 --> 01:27:28.026
When we get on the plane,
we'll have been together four years.

01:27:28.797 --> 01:27:30.355
What about the gap?

01:27:30.432 --> 01:27:33.629
You mean trial separation? Didn't work out.

01:27:33.969 --> 01:27:35.664
Happy anniversary.

01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:43.371
I'm going to take my eyes out.

01:27:46.215 --> 01:27:48.740
- What was in my sandwiches?
- Tuna.

01:27:49.651 --> 01:27:52.586
- How many stitches did I get?
- Two.

01:27:52.654 --> 01:27:54.747
But you should have had three.

01:27:56.058 --> 01:27:58.822
- What was your euphemism?
- Disarming.

01:27:59.294 --> 01:28:01.854
Too easy, buster. Next?

01:28:02.297 --> 01:28:05.198
That park. Who'd I go there with?

01:28:06.635 --> 01:28:08.159
Your father.

01:28:09.371 --> 01:28:12.306
Were the chairs in the hospital gray or blue?

01:28:12.941 --> 01:28:15.409
- No idea.
- Trick question. They were green.

01:28:15.477 --> 01:28:17.775
You are a trick question.

01:28:23.919 --> 01:28:26.387
How come we never took a vacation?

01:28:27.156 --> 01:28:28.623
We went to the country.

01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:32.649
Doesn't count. You were off
making sneaky phone calls...

01:28:32.995 --> 01:28:35.293
to that witch we do not mention.

01:28:40.436 --> 01:28:41.801
Come to bed.

01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:43.394
I need a smoke.

01:28:45.741 --> 01:28:49.040
- How'd you manage to give up?
- Deep inner strength.

01:28:59.721 --> 01:29:01.052
Why me?

01:29:02.624 --> 01:29:05.320
You could have chosen anyone. Why me?

01:29:06.462 --> 01:29:08.657
Because you cut off your crusts.

01:29:11.967 --> 01:29:13.229
And this.

01:29:16.772 --> 01:29:19.764
- When are you going to stop stripping?
- Soon.

01:29:20.075 --> 01:29:22.805
- You're addicted to it.
- No, I'm not.

01:29:22.878 --> 01:29:24.539
It paid for this.

01:29:26.748 --> 01:29:28.545
Tell me what happened.

01:29:30.185 --> 01:29:33.586
- Nothing happened.
- But he came to the club.

01:29:34.156 --> 01:29:37.250
Lots of men come to the club.
You came to the club.

01:29:51.006 --> 01:29:54.134
<i>- The look on your face.</i>
<i>- The look on your face.</i>

01:29:55.878 --> 01:29:58.438
<i>What a face. What a wig.</i>

01:30:04.186 --> 01:30:06.313
I saw this face...

01:30:08.223 --> 01:30:10.555
this vision...

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:15.362
when you stepped into the road.
It was the moment of my life.

01:30:16.798 --> 01:30:20.063
- This is the moment of your life.
- You were perfect.

01:30:20.369 --> 01:30:21.859
I still am.

01:30:23.071 --> 01:30:25.039
On the way to the hospital...

01:30:25.374 --> 01:30:27.239
<i>I kissed your forehead.</i>

01:30:27.809 --> 01:30:29.106
<i>You brute.</i>

01:30:29.178 --> 01:30:32.238
<i>The cabbie saw me kissing you.</i>
<i>He said, "Is she yours?"</i>

01:30:32.314 --> 01:30:34.305
<i>I said, "Yes, she's mine."</i>

01:30:36.151 --> 01:30:37.641
She's mine.

01:30:45.694 --> 01:30:50.597
So he came to the club, watched you strip,
you had a little chat, and that was it?

01:30:52.901 --> 01:30:54.061
Yes.

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:00.605
You're not trusting me.

01:31:01.443 --> 01:31:04.139
I'm in love with you. You're safe.

01:31:05.013 --> 01:31:07.379
You had every right. I just want to know.

01:31:07.449 --> 01:31:10.213
- Why?
- Because I want to know everything.

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:13.551
Because I'm a lunatic.

01:31:15.123 --> 01:31:16.385
Tell me.

01:31:18.527 --> 01:31:20.358
Nothing happened.

01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:24.799
- You were living with someone else.
- What are you justifying?

01:31:24.866 --> 01:31:26.697
I'm not justifying anything. Just saying.

01:31:26.768 --> 01:31:28.895
- What are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

01:31:28.971 --> 01:31:30.871
I just want the truth.

01:31:32.241 --> 01:31:34.835
- Where are you going?
- Cigarettes.

01:31:36.345 --> 01:31:37.710
Everywhere's closed.

01:31:37.779 --> 01:31:40.441
I'll go to the terminal.

01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:42.979
When I get back...

01:31:43.185 --> 01:31:45.153
please tell me the truth.

01:31:47.356 --> 01:31:50.291
- Why?
- Because I'm addicted to it.

01:31:50.726 --> 01:31:54.389
Because without it we're animals.

01:31:55.731 --> 01:31:57.096
Trust me.

01:33:03.665 --> 01:33:05.690
I don't love you anymore.

01:33:06.501 --> 01:33:07.798
Since when?

01:33:07.869 --> 01:33:09.029
Now.

01:33:09.838 --> 01:33:11.135
Just now.

01:33:12.207 --> 01:33:14.107
I don't want to lie...

01:33:14.776 --> 01:33:17.108
and I can't tell the truth...

01:33:17.546 --> 01:33:18.979
so it's over.

01:33:19.448 --> 01:33:21.109
It doesn't matter.

01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:25.150
- I love you. None of it matters.
- Too late.

01:33:27.622 --> 01:33:29.647
I don't love you anymore.

01:33:31.226 --> 01:33:32.454
Goodbye.

01:33:37.632 --> 01:33:39.463
Here's the truth...

01:33:40.335 --> 01:33:42.394
so now you can hate me.

01:33:44.806 --> 01:33:47.138
Larry fucked me all night.

01:33:48.643 --> 01:33:50.270
I enjoyed it.

01:33:51.313 --> 01:33:52.610
I came.

01:33:55.984 --> 01:33:57.474
I prefer you.

01:33:59.988 --> 01:34:01.285
Now go.

01:34:04.192 --> 01:34:05.591
I knew that.

01:34:06.528 --> 01:34:08.018
He told me.

01:34:08.764 --> 01:34:11.756
- You knew?
- I needed to hear it from you.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.998
- Why?
- Because he might have been lying.

01:34:15.337 --> 01:34:16.736
I had to hear it from you.

01:34:16.805 --> 01:34:19.968
I would never have told you,
because I know you'd never forgive me.

01:34:20.041 --> 01:34:21.668
I would. I have.

01:34:22.511 --> 01:34:25.002
- Why did he tell you?
- Because he's a bastard.

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.480
- How could he?
- Because he wanted this to happen.

01:34:27.549 --> 01:34:30.211
- But why test me?
- Because I'm an idiot.

01:34:30.285 --> 01:34:31.411
Yes.

01:34:32.387 --> 01:34:34.378
I would have loved you...

01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:36.789
forever.

01:34:38.627 --> 01:34:41.255
- Now please go.
- Don't do this. Talk to me.

01:34:41.329 --> 01:34:43.229
I am talking. Fuck off.

01:34:43.298 --> 01:34:45.789
No, I'm sorry. You misunderstand.
I didn't mean to...

01:34:45.867 --> 01:34:46.856
Yes, you did.

01:34:46.935 --> 01:34:48.459
- I love you.
- Where?

01:34:48.537 --> 01:34:50.266
- What?
- Show me.

01:34:50.972 --> 01:34:52.667
Where is this love?

01:34:53.475 --> 01:34:57.878
I can't see it. I can't touch it. I can't feel it.

01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:01.874
I can hear it. I can hear some words...

01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:04.942
but I can't do anything
with your easy words.

01:35:05.454 --> 01:35:07.888
Whatever you say, it's too late.

01:35:07.956 --> 01:35:11.016
- Please don't do this.
- It's done.

01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:15.626
Now please go, or I'll call security.

01:35:16.131 --> 01:35:18.861
You're not in a strip club.
There is no security.

01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:24.133
- Why did you fuck him?
- I wanted to.

01:35:24.206 --> 01:35:25.696
- Why?
- I desired him.

01:35:25.774 --> 01:35:27.765
- Why?
- You weren't there.

01:35:27.943 --> 01:35:30.571
- Why him?
- He asked me nicely.

01:35:30.645 --> 01:35:31.942
- You're a liar.
- So?

01:35:32.013 --> 01:35:34.447
- Who are you?
- I'm no one.

01:35:37.185 --> 01:35:40.518
Go on, hit me. That's what you want.
Hit me, fucker.

01:37:01.736 --> 01:37:04.330
- Welcome back, Miss Jones.
- Thank you.
