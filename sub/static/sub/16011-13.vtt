01:52.320 --> 01:54.160
- Okay, thank you guys,
- you're be number 3

01:54.200 --> 01:56.040
In the mime section.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.360
Who else do we have here? Mia?

01:58.400 --> 01:59.760
This oughta be good.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.480
Do I have to do this?

02:02.520 --> 02:03.760
Yes dear,

02:03.761 --> 02:05.000
the talent show is compulsory.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.600
But, being talented is not,

02:06.601 --> 02:08.160
so let's have a look.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.600
That's fine, you're number four,

02:20.601 --> 02:22.600
in the dance section.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.840
That's it?

02:23.880 --> 02:25.800
Yes, dear, that's a good start.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.640
- [Ms. Bulworth] Save the rest
- for the show.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.480
Did you see that?

02:32.400 --> 02:34.080
We all know that my singing

02:34.081 --> 02:35.760
is better than her dancing.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.800
But my singing will

02:36.801 --> 02:37.801
seem even better

02:37.840 --> 02:39.320
if she doesn't dance at all.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.240
What are you doing in the show?

02:56.800 --> 02:58.160
We're all singing

02:58.161 --> 02:59.520
backup for Violetta.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.880
She says there's no point in us

03:00.881 --> 03:02.200
doing anything else,

03:02.240 --> 03:03.640
since she's going to win.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.360
So you're just not going to try?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.680
- I'm not that good
- at anything anyway.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.760
Have you ever tried tap dancing?

03:13.800 --> 03:15.000
No.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.600
Why? Do you want to?

03:21.160 --> 03:22.680
Good! Now try this...

03:28.560 --> 03:29.840
Now you're getting it!

03:35.920 --> 03:37.040
Great!

03:39.920 --> 03:41.800
Hey.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.640
- There's a lot of people
- out there.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.616
- I don't know if I can do this.
- You can. It's easy.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.296
- Then how come I don't see you
- in the talent show,

03:47.320 --> 03:48.920
Mister "It's Easy"?

03:48.960 --> 03:50.880
- I'm the only person
- who was so un-talented,

03:50.920 --> 03:53.280
- They wouldn't even let me
- into a compulsory talent show.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.480
Two more, then it's you.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.560
Better get ready.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.960
Vincent. Did you take my shoes?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.160
Ppsss... Like I collect

04:03.161 --> 04:04.320
tap dancing shoes.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.840
Come on, I'm serious!

04:05.880 --> 04:07.560
I thought I put them right here!

04:07.600 --> 04:09.280
- I'm sorry, I don't know
- where they are.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.160
Missing something?

04:15.200 --> 04:17.360
Don't! Look, you don't have time

04:17.399 --> 04:18.959
- to get into this with her
- right now!

04:20.120 --> 04:21.399
Right, give me your shoes!

04:21.440 --> 04:23.320
Your regular ones.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.600
C'mon! Give me your shoes.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.560
Right, there's a bunch of junk

04:28.561 --> 04:29.760
right this way! Follow me!

04:35.680 --> 04:37.280
- Just two of pieces of metal,
- right?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.560
There's gotta be something.

04:39.760 --> 04:40.920
There is something.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.800
It's glowing.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.960
Let's see here.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.620
I just hope you know

04:55.621 --> 04:56.640
what you're doing.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.320
- Yeah, we'll see
- when you get back!

05:01.120 --> 05:03.360
Hi Mia. Say your password.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.460
"It matters not

05:04.461 --> 05:05.520
what's been completed,

05:05.560 --> 05:06.680
you must go

05:06.681 --> 05:07.800
where you're most needed."

05:18.960 --> 05:22.200
[screams]

05:25.000 --> 05:26.960
Woooa... uuughh...

05:27.000 --> 05:28.240
Aaaghhh!

05:28.280 --> 05:29.520
Ouch!

05:31.680 --> 05:33.400
Woaaaaaaaa.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.760
Oh! Whew!

05:34.800 --> 05:36.040
Hey, wait a minute,

05:36.080 --> 05:37.720
this is just like tap dancing.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.680
[laughs]

05:43.720 --> 05:45.016
- Woah! Woah... woah,
- woah woah waoh!

05:45.040 --> 05:46.360
Aaaahh!

05:48.720 --> 05:49.840
Oww!

05:49.880 --> 05:51.160
[spits]

05:51.200 --> 05:52.480
Eww.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.160
I'm just glad nobody saw that.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.320
[snort]

05:55.360 --> 05:57.960
[hee-haws]

05:58.000 --> 05:59.360
Ha ha.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.880
Very funny.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.200
[neighs]

06:02.240 --> 06:03.640
[Mia laughs]

06:03.680 --> 06:04.800
[snorts]

06:04.840 --> 06:06.320
Huh?

06:06.360 --> 06:07.680
What'cha looking for?

06:09.280 --> 06:10.600
[neighs]

06:12.400 --> 06:14.240
- I don't get it.
- What's over that way?

06:14.280 --> 06:16.000
[neighs]

06:16.040 --> 06:17.600
Onchao! Hey!

06:23.080 --> 06:24.560
Where are we going?!

06:24.600 --> 06:25.660
I've never seen you

06:25.661 --> 06:26.720
fly this fast!

06:26.760 --> 06:29.240
[gasps] Watch out for the...

06:29.280 --> 06:31.040
- Wooa!
- Balloon!

06:31.080 --> 06:32.960
Hi Mia! Hey Onchao!

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
[neighs]

06:35.040 --> 06:36.040
[Mo] Where are you headed

06:36.041 --> 06:37.041
in such a rush?

06:37.080 --> 06:38.300
I don't know! It's like he's

06:38.301 --> 06:39.520
being pulled that way!

06:39.560 --> 06:41.640
I can't stop him!

06:41.680 --> 06:42.880
It would seem

06:42.881 --> 06:44.080
he's not the only one.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.760
- And I think I see
- where they're going.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.000
[neighs]

06:49.040 --> 06:50.080
[gasps]

06:52.200 --> 06:53.500
That volcano looks set to blow.

06:53.501 --> 06:54.800
Is that bad?

06:54.840 --> 06:56.520
Is fire coming

06:56.521 --> 06:58.200
out of a mountain ever good?

06:58.240 --> 06:59.740
Unless the unicorns know

06:59.741 --> 07:01.240
something we don't.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.620
Legend does say

07:02.621 --> 07:03.960
that the Fire Unicorn dwells

07:04.000 --> 07:05.840
inside a volcano.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.120
Its power goes

07:07.121 --> 07:08.360
beyond imagining.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.920
- You would be wise
- to remember that.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.000
- [neighs]
- Oh!

07:13.560 --> 07:15.480
[Mia] Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh...

07:18.000 --> 07:19.460
Mo, Yuko, you'd best

07:19.461 --> 07:20.920
go with them.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.760
Come on! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

07:30.360 --> 07:32.320
[Mia] The Oracle said "You must

07:32.321 --> 07:34.280
go where you're most needed."

07:34.320 --> 07:35.500
[Mo] Well it seems like

07:35.501 --> 07:36.680
we're doing that right now.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.160
Maybe the Trumptus piece

07:38.161 --> 07:39.600
is here! Onchao?

07:39.640 --> 07:41.320
- He's got something else
- on his mind.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.720
[neighing]

07:44.760 --> 07:46.720
- They said it's a ceremony
- where young unicorns

07:46.760 --> 07:48.600
Get accepted into the herd!

07:48.640 --> 07:50.520
Onchao, that's amazing!

07:54.520 --> 07:56.120
[Mia] And also scary.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.600
Wait! Onchao!

08:01.640 --> 08:02.840
[snorts]

08:02.880 --> 08:04.480
Is there a Trumptus piece here?!

08:06.440 --> 08:08.280
[neighing]

08:08.320 --> 08:09.720
We can't go inside.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.360
Unicorns only. No elves.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.840
They'll just throw us out.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.000
No elves allowed, huh?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.360
Not if we don't get caught.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.039
Who's my little evil kitty?

08:38.041 --> 08:39.679
You are!

08:39.720 --> 08:41.080
Give mamma a kiss.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.760
- Give mamma...
- Burp!

08:42.799 --> 08:43.840
Eww.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.880
[coughs]

08:47.760 --> 08:49.120
Gargona?! Are you

08:49.121 --> 08:50.480
burning my lunch again?!

08:50.520 --> 08:53.560
No, my queen, not today.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.680
If you'd only

08:54.681 --> 08:55.760
look out outside...

08:57.720 --> 08:59.600
[Panthea] Ugh! Irritating.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.240
- Make it stop!

09:01.241 --> 09:02.840
- It's a volcano, my queen.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.520
I can see that!

09:04.560 --> 09:06.060
But my eyes are watering

09:06.061 --> 09:07.560
and Ziggo has a cough.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.600
Don't you Ziggo?

09:09.640 --> 09:11.360
[coughs]

09:11.400 --> 09:12.880
I don't care how you do it,

09:12.881 --> 09:14.360
stop that volcano,

09:14.400 --> 09:16.040
or it won't be

09:16.041 --> 09:17.680
the only thing smoking!

09:17.720 --> 09:19.640
- But...
- Now get out of here!

09:19.680 --> 09:22.200
Nobody makes my Ziggo cough.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.520
NOBODY!

09:23.560 --> 09:24.600
[coughs]

09:39.120 --> 09:41.000
[whispering] This is so cool.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.000
- Onchao can tell us
- where the piece is,

10:05.040 --> 10:06.700
We'll get it, and then we are

10:06.701 --> 10:08.360
out of the ceremony's way!

10:08.400 --> 10:10.800
Hey, Onchao! Ow!

10:10.840 --> 10:12.400
We are not messing up

10:12.401 --> 10:13.960
Onchao's ceremony!

10:14.000 --> 10:16.360
- There's no harm
- in looking around myself, right?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.400
Man, he can be so stubborn!

10:19.720 --> 10:21.920
Yuko! Where are you going?!

10:21.960 --> 10:24.000
Hmm? Go with the cute prince,

10:24.040 --> 10:25.600
or hide on a ledge.

10:26.440 --> 10:27.640
See ya.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.720
- [Mo] The piece could be
- anywhere.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.720
In a crack, down in the lava...

10:33.760 --> 10:34.920
Sitting in

10:34.921 --> 10:36.080
easy-to-get-to plain sight?

10:36.120 --> 10:37.160
What?

10:38.520 --> 10:40.280
Perfect! I'll get it!

10:42.520 --> 10:43.560
[rumble]

10:46.520 --> 10:47.720
MO!

10:51.160 --> 10:52.320
[Mia] What's happening?

11:14.360 --> 11:15.400
[earth tremor]

11:16.800 --> 11:18.160
[Mia] Wooooow!

11:22.560 --> 11:24.360
[Yuko] (GASPS) Uh!

11:24.400 --> 11:25.680
Well at least we didn't

11:25.681 --> 11:26.960
lose the Trumptus piece.

11:27.680 --> 11:28.840
Uuh?

11:28.880 --> 11:30.600
[Mo] Oh No!

11:33.080 --> 11:34.180
[Mo] We'll be back, Mia!

11:34.181 --> 11:35.280
Stay here.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.400
[neigh]

11:57.480 --> 11:58.600
[neighs wildly]

12:14.000 --> 12:15.240
[neighs]

12:16.240 --> 12:17.280
[neigh]

12:18.800 --> 12:19.840
[snorts]

12:24.440 --> 12:25.680
[neighing]

12:25.720 --> 12:27.000
[snorts impatiently]

12:34.280 --> 12:35.440
[snorts]

12:41.360 --> 12:43.280
[Mia] This is so amazing.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.480
I wish Mo and Yuko

12:44.481 --> 12:45.640
could see this!

12:47.840 --> 12:49.340
So, compensating for wind

12:49.341 --> 12:50.840
and trajectory,

12:50.880 --> 12:51.940
[Mo] I practically had it

12:51.941 --> 12:53.000
in my hand!

12:53.040 --> 12:54.960
- By my calculations
- the Trumptus piece

12:55.000 --> 12:56.440
Could have landed...

13:00.400 --> 13:02.760
There it is! The trumptus piece!

13:02.800 --> 13:05.000
Nice going Yoko!

13:05.040 --> 13:06.300
See? That wasn't

13:06.301 --> 13:07.560
so hard, now was it.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.280
- Woah!
- Woah!

13:19.480 --> 13:20.640
Look out!

13:23.360 --> 13:25.120
Oh come on!

13:26.200 --> 13:28.040
[grunting with effort]

13:30.240 --> 13:32.280
Great. What else can go wrong?!

13:32.320 --> 13:33.360
[distant shrieking]

13:36.720 --> 13:39.240
New rule: don't ever say

13:39.280 --> 13:41.360
"what else can go wrong".

13:41.400 --> 13:42.840
Mia better get here fast!

13:46.480 --> 13:49.160
Stop the volcano from smoking.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.700
How am I supposed to do that,

13:50.701 --> 13:52.200
you old hag?

13:56.040 --> 13:57.240
[neighs]

13:59.560 --> 14:00.920
[neighs]

14:06.200 --> 14:07.720
This is so exciting!

14:07.760 --> 14:09.320
Onchao's turn is next.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.600
DING!

14:10.640 --> 14:12.640
Uh oh. Bad timing.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.240
Ah! [gasps]

14:24.280 --> 14:25.880
[neighs angrily]

14:25.920 --> 14:27.360
Um... sorry...

14:27.400 --> 14:29.160
- I didn't mean to
- interrupt your ceremony.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.760
I'll leave you alone.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.940
I think my friends

14:31.941 --> 14:33.080
are in trouble outside.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.280
- [neighs]

14:36.281 --> 14:37.600
- No, finish your ceremony!

14:37.640 --> 14:39.080
It's your only chance!

14:39.120 --> 14:40.360
I'll manage!

14:42.360 --> 14:43.400
[gasps]

14:45.520 --> 14:47.960
AHH!

14:48.000 --> 14:49.400
Ugh!

14:50.760 --> 14:52.720
Onchao, you saved me!

14:52.760 --> 14:54.600
- Good thing one of us
- knows how to fly!

14:54.640 --> 14:55.680
[rumble]

14:58.120 --> 14:59.720
I'm sorry Onchao,

14:59.721 --> 15:01.320
I ruined your ceremony.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.280
[neighs]

15:04.320 --> 15:06.520
You'll help me? Oh thank you!

15:06.560 --> 15:07.640
DING!

15:07.680 --> 15:09.520
Take me to Yoko and Mo.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.320
[grumbles]

15:22.560 --> 15:23.640
[neighs]

15:24.880 --> 15:26.280
[Mia] I see them too!

15:27.360 --> 15:28.400
[grunting]

15:30.000 --> 15:31.640
Mia! Get us out of here!

15:31.680 --> 15:32.900
You've got to hurry!

15:32.901 --> 15:34.120
There are muncs nearby!

15:34.160 --> 15:36.000
- Alright, let's get this tree
- off of you.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.000
[grunts with effort]

15:41.240 --> 15:42.400
[distant shrieking]

15:42.401 --> 15:43.560
Uh oh. I think

15:41.240 --> 15:43.560
we've been spotted!

15:43.600 --> 15:45.960
What do we have here?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.520
The elf and her golden unicorn.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.200
Seize them!!

15:50.240 --> 15:52.120
You leave Onchao alone!

15:52.160 --> 15:53.880
I'd worry more

15:53.881 --> 15:55.600
about yourself, missy.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.560
[laughs maniacally]

15:57.600 --> 15:58.920
[hissing]

16:01.160 --> 16:02.680
FSSSHHH! FSHHH!

16:04.040 --> 16:07.240
[Gargona cackles]

16:07.280 --> 16:08.560
[Mo] AARGH!

16:08.561 --> 16:09.840
We can't hit them from here!

16:09.880 --> 16:11.060
Mia you have

16:11.061 --> 16:12.240
to get this off of us!

16:12.280 --> 16:14.200
- Kind of busy
- avoiding snakes here!

16:15.440 --> 16:16.560
Ugh!

16:16.600 --> 16:17.960
Useless!

16:18.000 --> 16:19.480
[neighs]

16:21.760 --> 16:24.840
Ouch! Onchao, stop it!

16:24.880 --> 16:26.280
Hey Onchao, have you ever

16:26.281 --> 16:27.680
tried tap dancing?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.440
Come on! Like this!

16:29.480 --> 16:31.200
[neighs]

16:31.240 --> 16:32.300
Um... can we roll it away

16:32.301 --> 16:33.360
from our heads,

16:33.400 --> 16:34.440
not towards them?!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.680
Onchao! Keep dancing!

16:39.960 --> 16:41.000
[growls]

16:44.720 --> 16:46.880
[neighs fearfully]

16:46.920 --> 16:47.960
Agh!

16:50.800 --> 16:51.840
Grrrr...

17:04.920 --> 17:05.960
Agh!

17:07.760 --> 17:09.920
[Gargona] Hahaha!

17:09.960 --> 17:11.359
I knew your luck

17:11.361 --> 17:12.760
would run out eventually.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.400
[Yuko] You get away from her!

17:21.280 --> 17:22.440
[Gargona] Hah!

17:22.480 --> 17:24.560
You almost had me!

17:24.599 --> 17:25.960
Too bad you didn't

17:25.961 --> 17:27.319
have better aim.

17:27.359 --> 17:28.880
[Mia] You mean like this?

17:31.200 --> 17:33.160
Agh! Oooh!

17:38.120 --> 17:39.520
Yes!

17:39.560 --> 17:41.320
- [Gargona] (HIGH PITCHED)
- Glare me?!

17:41.360 --> 17:43.000
How dare you!

17:43.040 --> 17:45.560
I am the mighty Gargona!

17:45.600 --> 17:47.160
Fear me!

17:48.040 --> 17:50.400
[both laugh]

17:50.440 --> 17:52.080
Oh never mind.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.760
I'll get you for this later!

17:55.880 --> 17:57.640
[Gargona] Sound a retreat!

17:59.800 --> 18:00.880
[hissing]

18:02.600 --> 18:03.640
[rumbling]

18:16.760 --> 18:18.120
[Mia] Oh no!

18:18.160 --> 18:20.280
The fire unicorn is gone!

18:22.440 --> 18:23.840
I'm so sorry.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.320
You were so brave,

18:27.360 --> 18:28.496
choosing to help your friends

18:28.520 --> 18:29.800
and stop the muncs.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.840
That Fire Unicorn has no idea

18:31.880 --> 18:33.720
what kind of unicorn you are.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.336
- If he won't accept you
- into the herd,

18:35.360 --> 18:36.640
I'll... I'll...

18:36.680 --> 18:38.040
[neighing]

18:42.040 --> 18:44.400
Oops! He he!

18:44.440 --> 18:46.200
[neighs wildly]

18:46.240 --> 18:48.080
Really? Go ahead Onchao.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.440
- Now's your chance.

18:49.441 --> 18:50.760
- What's going on?

18:50.800 --> 18:52.220
The Fire Unicorn says

18:52.221 --> 18:53.640
because of Onchao's bravery,

18:53.680 --> 18:55.120
he's going to give him something

18:55.160 --> 18:56.420
he's never given

18:56.421 --> 18:57.680
any unicorn before.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.800
[neighs]

18:59.920 --> 19:01.400
A second chance!

19:01.440 --> 19:02.720
Wow, you got all that

19:02.721 --> 19:04.000
from one neigh?

19:11.320 --> 19:12.360
[neighs loudly]

19:14.160 --> 19:15.680
The fire unicorn says

19:15.681 --> 19:17.200
Onchao can't use his wings.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.560
[neigh]

19:20.600 --> 19:21.640
[rumble]

19:22.760 --> 19:23.800
[neighs bravely]

19:30.760 --> 19:31.800
[gasps]

19:35.160 --> 19:36.800
[neighs]

19:36.840 --> 19:38.000
ONCHAO!

19:41.960 --> 19:43.000
[gasps]

19:49.360 --> 19:51.120
[neigh]

19:53.320 --> 19:54.480
[rumble]

20:14.080 --> 20:16.880
[all] WOOP! Way to go Onchao!

20:22.960 --> 20:24.920
You were so great today.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.180
And now you are officially

20:26.181 --> 20:27.400
part of two herds!

20:27.440 --> 20:29.320
The unicorns, and ours!

20:29.360 --> 20:30.560
But we have snappier clothes.

20:30.561 --> 20:31.760
[Mia gasps]

20:31.800 --> 20:32.920
Did you guys find

20:32.921 --> 20:34.040
the trumptus piece?

20:34.080 --> 20:35.120
I almost forgot about it

20:35.121 --> 20:36.160
in all the excitement.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.440
[sniffs]

20:44.080 --> 20:45.120
[Mia laughs]

20:46.400 --> 20:48.640
[neighing]

20:51.360 --> 20:52.780
Well it's good to see they

20:52.781 --> 20:54.200
haven't totally grown up yet.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.600
Which reminds me... I have

20:55.601 --> 20:56.960
to get back to my other herd...

20:57.000 --> 20:58.520
I've got a performance to do.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.840
Performance?

21:00.720 --> 21:01.800
Never mind.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.440
I'll see you guys later!

21:07.520 --> 21:09.000
Did I miss the show?

21:10.040 --> 21:11.120
[Ms. Bulworth] Mia.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.840
Vincent?!

21:18.840 --> 21:20.680
- They're not elegant,
- but they might work.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.320
- I guess I don't have a choice,
- right?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.240
Found them

21:25.241 --> 21:26.720
under Violetta's coat.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.400
I just... wanted you

21:28.401 --> 21:30.040
to be able to dance.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.440
[Ms. Bulworth] Mia?

21:33.480 --> 21:35.320
Are you there?

21:35.360 --> 21:37.080
I could use a partner.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.280
Me?

21:40.320 --> 21:41.776
- They might be
- a little lose on you,

21:41.800 --> 21:43.160
I have freakishly wide feet.

21:51.320 --> 21:53.080
[♪♪♪]
