13:31.976 --> 13:34.544
She's in a lotta
pain and uh Louise,

13:34.546 --> 13:36.246
well she got her good too.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.046
She's got a broken nose.

13:38.048 --> 13:41.917
Ronnie being here and
staying out of jail

13:41.919 --> 13:45.121
is contingent on
her good behavior.

13:45.123 --> 13:46.055
So...

13:46.057 --> 13:46.926
So?

13:47.926 --> 13:49.459
So it's jail.

13:49.461 --> 13:50.660
Just like that?

13:50.662 --> 13:52.262
Just like that Jessica.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.063
I'm not nitpicking here.

13:54.065 --> 13:58.401
That was no ones definition
of good behavior.

13:58.403 --> 14:00.936
Having her here is a danger to

14:00.938 --> 14:02.671
the other patients and for us.

14:02.673 --> 14:04.406
- You mean she's a liability
- No.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.276
for the legal department?

14:06.278 --> 14:08.076
Dr. Taylor she's a vet.

14:08.078 --> 14:10.479
She served this country and then

14:10.481 --> 14:14.584
she comes back and, Afghanistan.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.451
Three tours.

14:16.453 --> 14:19.955
A year home after tour
two, then back again.

14:19.957 --> 14:22.190
They go over there
and fight for us.

14:22.192 --> 14:24.193
They see unspeakable things.

14:24.195 --> 14:28.097
They do unspeakable
things and when

14:28.099 --> 14:31.033
they come back severely
psychologically damaged,

14:31.035 --> 14:33.236
we think it's not our problem.

14:33.238 --> 14:36.375
Like they're these monsters
to be banished from society.

14:37.341 --> 14:38.977
They told you this in school?

14:40.245 --> 14:41.513
It doesn't mean it's not true.

14:43.447 --> 14:46.382
So then you think
uh, you're the one

14:46.384 --> 14:48.651
that can give her
the help she needs.

14:48.653 --> 14:52.055
Uh you're, you're the one.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.661
Yes, you're the one who
can save the monster.

14:57.195 --> 14:59.661
I think I need to try.

14:59.663 --> 15:02.198
And I think a good
place to start

15:02.200 --> 15:04.199
would be not treating
her like a monster.

15:04.201 --> 15:05.133
Jessica.

15:05.135 --> 15:06.536
Not tying her to her bed.

15:06.538 --> 15:09.272
I know because of your
brother you wanna help her.

15:09.274 --> 15:10.739

is not a VA hospital.

15:13.410 --> 15:15.411
We're not set up for
these kinds of things.

15:15.413 --> 15:18.647

15:18.649 --> 15:20.083
JESSICA: Won't
she hate us then?

15:20.085 --> 15:23.353
Jessica, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

15:23.355 --> 15:25.624
but she is dangerous.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.757
She's proven that.

15:28.759 --> 15:30.361
One more strike.

15:31.296 --> 15:32.561
Half a strike.

15:32.563 --> 15:35.131
I'm sorry Jessica,
my decision is final.

- I'm sorry Jessica.

has died in her room.

was any fowl play.

56:07.061 --> 56:08.561

But it looks like someone
else was with her.

56:14.670 --> 56:15.802
There was a piece of evidence

56:15.804 --> 56:17.438
- left in Tina's room
- What the fuck?

56:17.440 --> 56:21.675

evidence in our possession.

56:21.677 --> 56:23.142
The authorities are on their way

56:23.144 --> 56:26.880
and when they arrive we will
give them this evidence.

56:26.882 --> 56:31.488
Without a doubt it will point
whoever else was there so,

56:32.822 --> 56:35.892
if that person would like
to step forward at any time,

56:37.025 --> 56:39.126
it could help clear
things up perhaps.

56:39.128 --> 56:42.766

assume their guilt,

56:44.766 --> 56:47.503

56:49.637 --> 56:52.442
they will be
charged with murder.
