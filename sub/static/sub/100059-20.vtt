WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.310
- It's just lunch.
You're great at lunch.

00:06.354 --> 00:07.572
You do it every day.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.139
- Yeah, but your family's
gonna be there

00:09.183 --> 00:11.489
and you know my eating style
isn't for everyone.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.969
- Is there a health inspection
or something?

00:13.013 --> 00:16.407
Your makeup looks nice.
- Oh, no, just a lunch.

00:16.451 --> 00:17.843
- Oh, good.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.062
Your blouse is decent too,

00:19.106 --> 00:20.585
and I didn't know
what the hell was going on.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.413
- Well, Jonah's parents
and brother are in town,

00:22.457 --> 00:23.588
so we're having lunch
with them.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.286
Thank you
for the almost compliment.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.114
My nerves feel soothed.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.854
- You have nothing
to be nervous about.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.900
My parents think you're great
and I'm sure Josh will too.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.990
- Which brother is Josh again?
I can't keep track of them all.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.818
- I only have two.
- Really?

00:35.861 --> 00:38.386
It feels like you grew up
talking over a large group.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.692
- Wait, isn't Josh the one
who threw that big party

00:40.736 --> 00:42.868
in high school and then framed
your housekeeper for it?

00:42.912 --> 00:44.479
- Big mistake.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.742
Anger the head maid, the whole
downstairs can turn on you.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.396
- One floor, one housekeeper.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.572
- My advice--don't get lost
in the siblings.

00:50.615 --> 00:51.921
It's the parents
you want to impress

00:51.964 --> 00:53.749
if you're gonna inherit
all those servants.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.490
- Zero.
Zero servants.

00:55.533 --> 00:58.058
- One would've been nice.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.586
- A gecko?
- Yes.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.805
It was just sitting on her
shoulder like a parrot--look.

01:06.849 --> 01:09.286
- I swear, we get the weirdest
customers at this store.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.767
I just helped a dad
with three kids on leashes.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.074
- Were they triplets?
Or just three kids?

01:14.117 --> 01:15.771
'Cause in the world
of customer weirdness,

01:15.814 --> 01:17.120
I'd put reptiles up here

01:17.164 --> 01:18.817
and children in restraints
down here.

01:18.861 --> 01:22.560
But if we're talking multiples,
now I'm gonna need a photo.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.040
- Oh, okay.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.477
Let me see if he's still
untangling them in housewares.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.305
- Mm-hmm.

01:28.349 --> 01:29.828
- Wow, you've thought
about this a lot.

01:29.872 --> 01:32.092
- Yeah, well, in customer
service, you can get all kinds.

01:32.135 --> 01:33.571
Yesterday, a lady came in

01:33.615 --> 01:36.313
and complained about a sandwich
that she made at home.

01:36.357 --> 01:41.623
- Okay, hot nun, face tattoo,
stilettos and sweats.

01:41.666 --> 01:45.192
- Nun, tattoo,
stilettos and sweats.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.760
- I just love the way
your mind words.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.241
- Oh, Chile was great.

01:51.285 --> 01:52.590
And they loved us down there.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.550
You know, they expect Americans
to be fat slobs,

01:55.593 --> 01:58.422
you know what I mean,
but then...

01:58.466 --> 02:00.163
- Chile's never really
called to me.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.425
Too narrow.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.514
- Yeah, he prefers
a girthier country.

02:03.558 --> 02:04.689
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.127
Did you guys see the link
that I sent you?

02:07.170 --> 02:09.172
Amy got her profile
on the Zephra website.

02:09.216 --> 02:12.044
They love her over there.
- Yeah, that's terrific.

02:12.088 --> 02:14.221
We didn't actually get a chance
to read it yet.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.136
Our printer's out
of cartridges.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.789
- Ah.
- But you have a screen--

02:17.833 --> 02:19.791
- Nah, it's a whole thing.
Don't bother.

02:19.835 --> 02:21.837
- I gotta say, Amy,
we never thought any girl

02:21.880 --> 02:24.492
would compare to Matilda
in his eyes, so--

02:24.535 --> 02:26.798
- Oh, who is Matilda?

02:26.842 --> 02:29.192
- Irrelevant.
- Our Boston Terrier.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.455
Lovely dog, really.
Very regal.

02:31.499 --> 02:34.110
- Jonah was literally
in love with her.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.459
Like, romantically.

02:35.503 --> 02:39.028
- When I was seven, I said
I loved our dog so much

02:39.071 --> 02:40.116
that I wanted to marry her.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.727
- That's so cute.
- Thank you.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.642
- That's sick, though,
when you think about it.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.253
- Yeah, like, what would
you guys even do?

02:47.645 --> 02:49.212
- Oh.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.562
It's the office.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.129
I'm sorry
for the jargon, Jonah.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.914
An office is one of those rooms
with a desk in it.

02:55.958 --> 02:59.570
People with careers have them.
How do I...

02:59.614 --> 03:00.745
Oh, Amy, you have an office.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.138
Maybe you can explain it
to him.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.618
- Yeah.

03:03.661 --> 03:07.317
I'm pretty sure Jonah has
seen the inside of--okay.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.319
- So I told her, you know,
"Don't worry.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.755
"Jonah's parents are
gonna love you.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.931
But if they're paying,
don't fill up on bread."

03:12.975 --> 03:14.629
- Come on, this is
Amy we're talking about.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.457
"Filled up on bread" is
gonna go on her gravestone.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.719
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.503
I need to speak
to the assistant manager.

03:19.547 --> 03:21.592
- Brian, what are
you doing here?

03:21.636 --> 03:24.029
Glenn, this is
Dr. Brian Patterson,

03:24.073 --> 03:26.206
veterinarian and boyfriend.

03:26.249 --> 03:28.991
- Yeah, no, I had a little
window of time open up today.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.384
Horse died early.
- Oh.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.995
- So yeah, thought I'd pop in
and surprise you.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.563
- Oh, I didn't know that
veterinarians use tongs.

03:35.606 --> 03:37.217
Is that for handling dog guts?

03:37.260 --> 03:39.131
- Oh, no.
Just salad.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.916
- Oh, yeah.
Uh-huh.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.526
- Anyways, I missed you

03:42.570 --> 03:44.659
and I thought maybe I'd see
if I could have a lunch date.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.574
- Well, I have a break
in 15 minutes.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.054
- Okay, yeah--well, I will
get us a table at the cafÃ©.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.447
- Great.
- Okay, bye.

03:50.491 --> 03:52.754
Nice to meet you.
- Oh.

03:52.797 --> 03:53.842
- What is this?

03:53.885 --> 03:55.278
He's showing up
during work hours?

03:55.322 --> 03:57.280
Is this, like, a test
or some kind of weird kink?

03:57.324 --> 04:00.675
- Okay, Dina, relax.
It's just a surprise date.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.111
Enjoy this.

04:02.154 --> 04:04.505
The beginning of a relationship
is the best part.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.593
- Yeah, I know.
I know that.

04:05.636 --> 04:06.898
- Well, I thought
you might not,

04:06.942 --> 04:09.031
you know, 'cause this is
your first real--

04:09.074 --> 04:13.078
- I know romance, Glenn, okay?
I've seen "You've Got Mail."

04:13.122 --> 04:15.124
40 minutes of it.
I was getting my tires rotated.

04:15.167 --> 04:18.736
Point is romance equals
spontaneity plus fun.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.129
- Mm-hmm.
- So how about this?

04:20.172 --> 04:22.871
Huh?
How's this for fun?

04:22.914 --> 04:25.003
- Oh, I love it.
You should let it all down.

04:25.047 --> 04:27.528
- Glenn, we're still at work,
not an opium den.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.096
- I did not notice that
the kids' leashes had

04:31.140 --> 04:33.795
studded leather on them,
so that bumps it up some.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.840
- Did you see the gecko has
painted nails, though?

04:35.884 --> 04:37.451
- I did not.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.279
I'm sorry, Cheyenne.
Gecko lady's weirder.

04:39.322 --> 04:41.411
- Yes, I win.
- Whatever--lame.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.152
- What'd you win?
I'll play.

04:43.195 --> 04:45.110
- Oh, no.
It's not a game--

04:45.154 --> 04:47.983
- I wanna play too.
- Guys, seriously, no games.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.289
Amy's gone,

04:49.332 --> 04:51.378
so it's up to us to be
responsible employees.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.596
I'm kidding.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.989
Obviously we're gonna
make this a game.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.773
"Customer Safari."

04:55.817 --> 04:57.949
It's a $10 entrance fee,
and as you can see,

04:57.993 --> 05:00.343
I got 35 categories
on the board.

05:00.387 --> 05:01.953
- Why is
"blowing nose in towels"

05:01.997 --> 05:03.390
worth more than "juggalo"?

05:03.433 --> 05:04.652
- 'Cause juggalos
aren't as rare.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.567
ICP just played St. Louis.

05:06.610 --> 05:09.396
- Yeah, it was fun.
It's a real community.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.788
- Only one winner per category.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.268
You see something, snap a pic,

05:12.312 --> 05:13.965
submit it to me
for verification.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.750
- Oh, and make sure
the customer doesn't see you.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.534
For some reason,
privacy's hot right now.

05:17.578 --> 05:18.796
- Okay, so everybody's in.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.059
That means the winner's
gonna get 200 bucks.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.800
- Oh, hell yeah.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.628
- I am gonna be so good
at this game.

05:24.672 --> 05:27.544
I'm constantly taking
creep shots of dads in parks.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.852
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

05:30.895 --> 05:33.637
- A lot of foam.
Somebody didn't tilt.

05:33.681 --> 05:37.641
- So Josh, is he,
like, in a bad mood--

05:37.685 --> 05:39.904
- He's a dick.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.906
You were just so nervous
about today already,

05:41.950 --> 05:44.474
I kind of bluffed
about how tolerable he is.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.607
- Okay, yeah, so he is a dick.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.435
And I can say that?
- Definitely.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.088
- Good because he is a dick.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.177
- Look, don't hold back
on my account.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.963
If you wanna fire back at him,
like, go for it.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.399
- Nah, I'm not stooping
to his level.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.922
It's better
to take the high road.

05:57.966 --> 06:01.012
- Really?
Come on, I can barely stand it.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.101
And your parents, they're
just, like, laughing along.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.755
I don't even see what
they like about him.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.714
I mean, I get it--
he's their son or whatever.

06:06.757 --> 06:09.064
But I would hate Parker
if he snapped his fingers

06:09.107 --> 06:10.500
to get a bus boy's attention

06:10.544 --> 06:12.850
or, like, got an innocent
housekeeper fired.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.244
- Actually, my parents don't
know about the Rita thing.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.593
- What?
- Yeah.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.900
- Oh, well, bring that up.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.075
- It's not worth it.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.033
I only see my family
a couple times a year.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.819
Let's just get through the meal
and be the bigger people.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.603
- And then we can, you know,

06:26.647 --> 06:28.518
talk trash about him
behind his back for weeks.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.041
- Okay, fine,

06:30.085 --> 06:32.130
but this high road thing
looks better on Michelle Obama.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.436
- That's not fair.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.046
Everything looks better
on Michelle Obama.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.968
- Aggressively patriotic
T-shirt--oh, yeah.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.144
- "Love this land
or I'll bury you in it"?

06:46.188 --> 06:48.451
Wow, 50 points.
- Yes.

06:53.369 --> 06:56.024
- Disturbingly long nails.
15 points.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.900
- Ride it.
Come on, ride it, you tease.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.209
- I only asked
for one tuxedo kid, man.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.558
15 points is all
I can give you.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.913
- Is this even a category?
- It's gotta be, right?

07:17.088 --> 07:19.047
- I love when you ask
for it al dente

07:19.090 --> 07:20.352
and it comes al dente.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.876
both: Mm-hmm.
- Best feeling.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.051
- Wow, this is huge.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.009
I'm never gonna be able
to finish this.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.315
- Oh, come on, buddy.
You can finish.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.360
It's not business school.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.493
- Zing, Joshie.
- That's funny.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.799
Also, you know,

07:31.842 --> 07:33.365
if a school isn't
the right fit for somebody--

07:33.409 --> 07:35.237
- It's fine.
Do you want some bread?

07:35.280 --> 07:38.240
- He's just teasing, sweetie.
He's our little comedian.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.720
- That's me.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.983
Oh, hey, speaking of funny,
has Jonah ever told you

07:42.026 --> 07:44.202
about the play that
he wrote in theater camp?

07:44.246 --> 07:46.553
- "The Architecture
of Hope and Fear."

07:46.596 --> 07:47.815
- Ugh.
- Yeah.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.512
- Let's just say it wasn't
bound for Broadway.

07:49.556 --> 07:52.820
- Yeah--oh, and don't forget
the heroine's name.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.823
Tell her, Jonah.
- Matilda.

07:55.866 --> 07:58.129
- Matilda.
- Ew, the dog wife.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.609
- He never got over it.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.872
Actually, Matilda had some
pretty steamy scenes in it.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.179
- It wasn't intentional.

08:04.222 --> 08:07.269
I guess my subconscious
took the wheel there.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.445
- I guess so.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.100
- But he didn't really
wanna marry the dog.

08:13.754 --> 08:16.626
I mean, he was just a kid.
He said a weird thing.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.323
Kids say weird things
all the time.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.325
They made a show about it.
- Mm, yeah.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.544
Have you seen the new one?

08:21.588 --> 08:23.198
I really enjoy that
Tiffany Hasheesh.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.287
- Oh, yes, she's marvelous.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.552
- No, no, no, no, no.
I said adult baby.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.336
This is an adult with a baby.
- Hey.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.990
- Hey, do you guys know

08:33.034 --> 08:34.644
why there's no one
working checkouts?

08:34.688 --> 08:38.996
- Well, I heard something
about a big spill.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.868
- Yeah?
- All hands on deck situation.

08:40.911 --> 08:42.217
- Guys, come on.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.827
I know what it's like
when the manager's away.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.656
Yeah, you take a little
longer break, eat a hot dog,

08:46.700 --> 08:50.312
turn all the screens
in electronics to MTV.

08:50.355 --> 08:51.705
- Yeah, well,
I guess you got us.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.837
We're just a bunch of rebels.
- Aw, come on.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.666
So tell me what's going on.

08:58.799 --> 09:02.150
Oh, okay.
Well...

09:02.193 --> 09:03.978
And Sandra,
you'd better confess

09:04.021 --> 09:05.457
because I already
asked Garrett,

09:05.501 --> 09:07.590
and he sold you
down the river.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.026
- When? We've been
together the entire time.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.332
- Hmm?
- Yeah, Glenn.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.812
If you wanna play us
against each other,

09:11.855 --> 09:14.031
you have to separate us first.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.295
- Sandra, could I see you
outside or a minute?

09:17.339 --> 09:19.254
- I don't think so, Glenn.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.824
- Garrett, could I see--
- Come on, man.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.173
- This is nice.

09:25.216 --> 09:28.393
I'm really glad that you
came here unannounced

09:28.437 --> 09:32.833
and now we are having
a completely unscheduled lunch.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.051
- Yeah.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.140
- Hope this hair
isn't freaking you out.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.925
- No, not at all.
I like it.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.187
- Me too. Me too.
- Yeah.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.362
- It just kinda happened.
Wasn't planned.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.669
A bit spontaneous.

09:42.712 --> 09:46.586
- Dibs on the steampunk guy
in electronics!

09:47.369 --> 09:50.633
- Wow, kind of a Friday
energy on a Thursday, huh?

09:50.677 --> 09:53.027
I love that.
- Yeah, same.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.463
Same.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.596
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.905
- Glenn, you smell scared.
What's up?

10:01.949 --> 10:03.733
- Not much.
Everything's mostly great.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.909
Just that something's up
with the employees.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.781
I'm not sure what,
but the good news is

10:07.824 --> 10:10.174
is that it's very quickly
getting out of hand,

10:10.218 --> 10:12.089
so it'll probably blow up
and be over soon.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.221
- Do I need to get involved?

10:13.264 --> 10:14.526
It feels like I need
to get involved.

10:14.570 --> 10:17.225
- No, no, no, go have lunch
with your boyfriend.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.880
Go ahead.
Don't worry, I've--I've--

10:19.923 --> 10:21.272
I've got this.

10:24.449 --> 10:27.670
- Everything good?

10:27.714 --> 10:30.107
- Yeah, Glenn's got this
handled and, you know,

10:30.151 --> 10:34.068
his mind and body are...fine.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.026
- Yeah.
He seems great.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.201
- Totally.
I just remembered,

10:37.245 --> 10:38.681
I left all
my felt tips uncapped

10:38.725 --> 10:40.291
in the security office,
and those are just gonna be

10:40.335 --> 10:42.554
drying out like crazy,
so I just need to go

10:42.598 --> 10:44.861
and put the-the little helmets
on the soldiers.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.820
- Okay.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.696
K-Fai, What the hell?

10:53.740 --> 10:55.742
I told you to make sure
no one took a pic of you

10:55.785 --> 10:56.960
before I did.

10:57.004 --> 10:59.833
- Okay, he's hella sneaky.
I did not see him.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.573
- Wait, you're K-Fai?

11:01.617 --> 11:03.619
Oh, my God, you're cheating.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.752
You totally tried to stage
"clothes same shade as skin."

11:05.795 --> 11:08.668
- Shh! Yes, but only because
I, like, wanted to win.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.495
- Okay, I feel like
if Garrett knew about this,

11:10.539 --> 11:12.497
he would totally kick you
out of the game,

11:12.541 --> 11:15.065
but I'm your friend,
so I'm just gonna extort you.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.241
-  Fine.
50 bucks if I win?

11:17.285 --> 11:19.330
- Deal.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.245
I'm Mateo, by the way.
I'm sure you've heard of me.

11:21.289 --> 11:24.074
- Uh, I-I've heard of Brett.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.555
Okay.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.473
- Ooh, a passion fruit Bellini.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.257
Should I order a carafe?

11:33.301 --> 11:34.476
- Oh, none for us.

11:34.519 --> 11:37.131
I'm actually booze-free
these days.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.959
Plus, Kelce and I
are off sugar, so...

11:39.002 --> 11:40.743
- Yeah, way more energy.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.267
- Yahoo actually says sugar
is extremely addictive.

11:43.311 --> 11:45.574
- Well, I mean,
sugar is bad for you,

11:45.617 --> 11:47.271
but it's actually
not addictive.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.795
That's just a myth.
- Oh-oh-oh-oh.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.797
Dr. Jonah's in the house.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.408
That's so funny,
because I thought you lied

11:53.451 --> 11:55.279
about going to med school
for three years,

11:55.323 --> 11:56.803
But maybe I'm just mixed up.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.718
Maybe after lunch you could do
some brain surgery on me.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.241
- I can do it.

12:00.284 --> 12:01.851
Okay, high road.
I got it.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.505
- Jalapeno margarita.

12:03.548 --> 12:04.898
Do we think
that's too spicy?

12:04.941 --> 12:06.682
- No, I've had it.
You'll love it, trust me.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.684
- Trust him, Mom, he only
deceived you for three years.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.686
"Trust me, Mom, in med school."

12:10.730 --> 12:13.080
- "Trust me, Mom, Matilda
and I are just friends."

12:13.123 --> 12:14.908
- Now this jagoff?

12:14.951 --> 12:18.346
- Hey, man, real talk,
that med school lie was messed.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.174
You broke Mom's heart.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.262
- Oh, are we doing
real talk now?

12:21.305 --> 12:22.524
- No, no, they're
doing real talk.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.178
We're doing spicy margs.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.441
- It's just 'cause I happen
to know that Jonah is not

12:26.484 --> 12:28.617
the only family member
who's lied to Marilyn.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.794
- Who else has lied?

12:31.838 --> 12:34.971
- Okay, I, uh--
I may have told Amy

12:35.015 --> 12:37.234
some family stuff that she--

12:37.278 --> 12:39.628
- They're talking about me.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.717
Marilyn, I--

12:41.761 --> 12:44.198
I started sleeping
with Shelley again.

12:47.157 --> 12:48.942
- What?

12:51.814 --> 12:53.816
- I thought that was over.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.905
- It was, I swear.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.907
Absolutely nothing happened
for years.

12:57.951 --> 13:00.257
I mean, she was a great
secretary and nothing more.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.955
And then the holidays
rolled around,

13:01.998 --> 13:04.000
we had the holiday party,

13:04.044 --> 13:06.829
and Shelley debuted
this new wig, and...

13:06.873 --> 13:10.311
I just--I-I forgot myself.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.834
- Jesus, Dad.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.836
- I'm so sorry, this is
not at all what I was trying--

13:13.880 --> 13:15.490
- Jonah, how did you know?

13:15.533 --> 13:17.187
Did I accidentally text you
instead of Shelley?

13:17.231 --> 13:19.842
- Oh.
- Oh, no, was there a--

13:19.886 --> 13:21.975
a visual component?
- Oh, God.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.890
- No, Dad, no, I didn't know.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.848
When Amy mentioned
the lying,

13:25.892 --> 13:27.458
she was talking
about Josh and Rita.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.460
- What? I--

13:29.504 --> 13:31.158
I-I don't even know
what you're talking about.

13:31.201 --> 13:34.030
- Ah, come on.
The house party, Rita.

13:34.074 --> 13:36.032
- Oh, yeah, I remember that,
she stained the rugs,

13:36.076 --> 13:38.121
and then she filled up all
the vodka bottles with water,

13:38.165 --> 13:40.515
and we found this strawberry
gelatin in the shower.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.865
- No, Dad, Josh and his friends
did all of that.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.824
- Joshie wouldn't do that.
- No, I didn't.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.000
- Just a quick
outsider's perspective.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.871
A 60-year-old
Colombian woman

13:48.915 --> 13:50.481
doing gelatin shots
in the shower

13:50.525 --> 13:51.787
just seems kind of odd.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.571
- Okay, well, forget it.
It doesn't matter.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.704
We obviously have more
important things that are--

13:55.747 --> 13:56.966
- Wait.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.881
There were a ton of empty
liquor bottles

13:58.925 --> 14:00.491
when I came home
from Sam's wedding,

14:00.535 --> 14:01.841
and my place was trashed.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.233
You told me to fire
my dog walker.

14:03.277 --> 14:04.887
- Kelce, it was the dog walker.
Remember?

14:04.931 --> 14:06.236
I don't even drink.
- Okay.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.151
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.283
- Mom.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.633
- I just wanted to have
a nice lunch

14:11.676 --> 14:14.418
with my family.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.072
- I should go talk to her.
- No. No, no, no, no.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.247
- No, I really need to.
- No, you don't need to go.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.858
- I can't stop myself.
I'm going.

14:18.901 --> 14:19.989
- Amy--

14:20.033 --> 14:22.252
- Listen,
I'm-I'm really sorry.

14:22.296 --> 14:25.908
I just got caught up
in the--in the felt tips.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.083
Which are here.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.780
Don't look for them,
but they are here.

14:28.824 --> 14:31.305
- Look, Dina,
if you're busy,

14:31.348 --> 14:33.611
I can just take off.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.091
You know what?

14:35.135 --> 14:37.137
It might be for the best.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.790
- I'm just gonna
come out and say this.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.792
I'm new to the whole
relationship thing,

14:40.836 --> 14:44.318
and I know I'm supposed
to be like a free-wheeling,

14:44.361 --> 14:47.060
pizza parlor roller girl,
but that's just--

14:47.103 --> 14:48.931
it's-it's not me.

14:48.975 --> 14:49.976
- Oh, no, no, no, Dina.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.891
I'm the one who showed up
unannounced.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.762
I totally get it,

14:53.805 --> 14:55.633
and we can do lunch
another time.

14:55.677 --> 14:57.592
- Really?
- Absolutely.

14:57.635 --> 14:58.941
- Thank you.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.247
Because something's going on
with the employees,

15:00.290 --> 15:03.163
and I need to interrogate
this suspect.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.905
- Oh, wow, you're not just
the assistant manager.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.603
You're like a detective.
That is cool.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.692
Do you ever need any backup?

15:10.735 --> 15:12.085
- No, never work
with a partner.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.957
No, they're either dead weight
or they turn on you.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.350
Oh, wait, you meant you.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.830
- If that's okay.
- Oh, yeah!

15:18.874 --> 15:20.310
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no, this is great.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.529
- Okay.

15:24.575 --> 15:27.361
- Hey.

15:27.404 --> 15:28.884
How you doing?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.320
- Oh, I'm okay.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.627
Richard and I survived
Shelley once before,

15:32.670 --> 15:33.845
and we will do it again.

15:33.889 --> 15:36.892
- That's, uh, good.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.241
- Yeah.
- But I am sorry

15:38.285 --> 15:39.590
about how it all
came to light.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.549
I didn't mean
to upset you or Kelci,

15:41.592 --> 15:43.943
which, by the way,
how do we feel about her?

15:43.986 --> 15:47.859
- I like her...purse.

15:47.903 --> 15:50.253
- Yes, same.
Me too.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.385
- Oh.

15:51.428 --> 15:54.127
- But, um, anyway,
it's just that

15:54.170 --> 15:56.216
Josh is really hard
on Jonah,

15:56.259 --> 15:59.001
and I was just getting
a little protective,

15:59.045 --> 16:01.482
and I get it, that
the med school lie was nuts,

16:01.525 --> 16:03.136
but, you know,
it was one lie,

16:03.179 --> 16:04.746
and it didn't hurt anybody,

16:04.789 --> 16:06.400
because Jonah
doesn't hurt people.

16:06.443 --> 16:09.794
He's--he's good.

16:09.838 --> 16:12.058
- You really care for him.
Hmm?

16:12.101 --> 16:14.277
That's really nice.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.411
Let's get back out there, hmm?

16:19.848 --> 16:21.284
- Sorry, I got caught up
in the moment.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.852
I actually really have to pee.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.723
- Hey, Sandra.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.465
Just wanted to introduce you
to my boyfriend, Brian.

16:28.509 --> 16:29.858
- Brian the vet.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.208
So nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.210
- Well, one thing
I bet you haven't heard

16:34.254 --> 16:36.560
is that I'm also
a veterinarian.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.258
That's right,
you just said that.

16:38.301 --> 16:41.391
- Listen, I've got a vet
and you've got a messed-up cat.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.089
Maybe we could
help each other out,

16:43.132 --> 16:44.525
'cause I need to know
what's going on.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.222
What's with all the phones
and the sneaking around?

16:46.266 --> 16:48.572
- Dina, please, I can't say.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.357
I don't wanna get
anyone in trouble.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.402
Brett just let me follow him
on Instagram.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.014
- Okay, well, it's a shame
you won't help us

16:55.057 --> 16:58.669
'cause this guy loves doing
feline lumpectomies.

16:58.713 --> 17:01.759
And refresh my memory,
does Biscuit have lumps?

17:01.803 --> 17:03.370
- So many.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.459
It's like holding
a bag of marbles.

17:05.502 --> 17:08.027
- Well, I'd be happy to smooth
that cat out for you.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.941
Free of charge, of course.
- Of course.

17:09.985 --> 17:12.422
- Okay.
Fine.

17:12.466 --> 17:15.295
But I'm only giving you this.

17:15.338 --> 17:18.211
White board, warehouse.

17:18.254 --> 17:20.604
Secret photos, customers,

17:20.648 --> 17:23.694
game, $200 prize.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.609
But that's all I can say.

17:28.612 --> 17:31.789
- I can't believe she left.
Is she serious right now?

17:31.833 --> 17:33.443
- Not your fault, son.

17:33.487 --> 17:36.098
Relationships are complicated.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.579
-  Actually, no.

17:38.622 --> 17:41.625
Actually your relationships
are very simple.

17:41.669 --> 17:44.367
Mom is crushed
because you cheated on her.

17:44.411 --> 17:47.022
And Kelci dumped you
because you're a jackass.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.154
- Jonah.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.459
- I'm sorry, Dad,
but it's true.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.679
He's a liar
and a mile-wide douche,

17:51.722 --> 17:55.161
and I'm glad Kelci
figured that out.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.988
- Honey, let me--

17:57.032 --> 17:58.338
- I'll be quick.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.557
Amy and I just had
a lovely talk in the bathroom.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.777
You know,
what she and Jonah have

18:02.820 --> 18:03.952
is something
really very special.

18:05.345 --> 18:06.476
- I deserve someone
who loves me like that.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.696
- Look, Marilyn--
- We'll talk later.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.220
Just letting you know,
I want a divorce.

18:15.050 --> 18:17.661
- Oh, yummy.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.011
The margs are here.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.405
Wait, are we missing people?

18:26.714 --> 18:28.585
- I'm really sorry.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.327
If I woulda just stuck
to the high road with you,

18:31.371 --> 18:33.068
none of this
would have happened.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.376
Honestly, I think it's good.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.378
She should have
left him years ago.

18:38.421 --> 18:41.163
- You mean, like, the first
time Shelley happened?

18:41.207 --> 18:43.165
- Right around then, yeah.
- Yeah.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.733
- I called my brother
a douche to his face.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.604
- What?
For real?

18:47.648 --> 18:49.171
- Mm-hmm.
- And I missed it?

18:49.215 --> 18:51.478
- Mm-hmm, yeah, it was great.

18:51.521 --> 18:54.524
Sometimes the low road
gets you there.

18:54.568 --> 18:57.788
- Well, I am
really proud of you.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.574
And I know Matilda
would be too.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.837
- He brings that up a lot.
I'm sorry.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.405
- My take,
he wants to bang the dog.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.015
Classic projection.

19:07.058 --> 19:10.149
- I-I don't think--
I mean, none of us want to--

19:11.802 --> 19:13.064
Anyway, she's dead.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.892
- Aww.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.771
- Did you just take my photo,
you pervert?

19:23.814 --> 19:27.209
- No, I'm not a pervert
and you're not that cute.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.906
It's for Customer Safari.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.778
You're just
"pet in baby carrier."

19:30.821 --> 19:32.823
- Ah-ha!
- Ya stung!

19:32.867 --> 19:34.782
This was a sting operation,

19:34.825 --> 19:36.610
and you confessing that
means we can now

19:36.653 --> 19:38.699
shut the whole thing down.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.309
- Actually, I coulda
shut it down before,

19:40.353 --> 19:42.050
but I thought this
might be fun for you.

19:42.093 --> 19:45.009
- Well, you were right,
'cause I loved it.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.402
Right? Yeah.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.709
both: Oh.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.363
- Game over, scrodes!

19:50.406 --> 19:51.886
- Yeah, scrodes!

19:51.929 --> 19:54.193
Hi, uh, I'm Brian,
by the way.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.846
I'm Dina's boyfriend.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.805
I met some of you,
not everybody,

19:57.848 --> 19:59.372
and this is not mine.

19:59.415 --> 20:02.070
Borrowed her from a client.
- We know everything.

20:02.113 --> 20:04.246
- Sorry, this guy tricked me
into taking a photo

20:04.290 --> 20:06.422
of him and his stupid pig.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.555
It's so cute though.
Can I pet it?

20:08.598 --> 20:10.905
- Yes.

20:10.948 --> 20:14.169
- Oh, man, you guys,
Cheyenne really blew it.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.389
Ugh, we're all so mad.

20:16.432 --> 20:19.087
- All right, Garrett,
give everyone their money back,

20:19.130 --> 20:21.089
and then all of you
get back to work.

20:21.132 --> 20:23.570
But if anyone got VSCO Girl,
could you send that me?

20:23.613 --> 20:25.528
I still don't know
what that is.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.661
- âª I'm all out of faith

20:27.704 --> 20:30.098
âª This is how I feel

20:30.141 --> 20:32.492
âª I'm cold and I am shamed

20:37.366 --> 20:38.759
- Oh, Amy, there you are.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.021
- Hey, Glenn, so sorry.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.892
I think Zephra Corporate
just tried to call me.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.938
- Yeah, okay, real quick.
I don't want you to panic,

20:43.981 --> 20:46.897
but there's some kind of
storewide game going on.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.812
Now, I don't know what it is,
but I know that--

20:48.856 --> 20:50.336
- That's so great, Glenn.
Keep it up.

20:50.379 --> 20:51.989
Thank you.
You're the best.

20:52.033 --> 20:55.166
- Okay. If it comes up
on the call, play dumb.

20:55.210 --> 20:58.169
- I'm sorry, what position
is this for exactly?

20:58.213 --> 21:00.302
- Director of Customer
Experience for Cloud 9.

21:00.346 --> 21:04.306
- For, like, all of them?
All the Cloud 9s?

21:04.350 --> 21:06.439
- Yep, it'd be at our
headquarters in Palo Alto.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.267
Maya Fonseca
at the Chicago office

21:08.310 --> 21:10.181
gave you a glowing
recommendation,

21:10.225 --> 21:11.618
and we're holding
interviews next week.

21:11.661 --> 21:15.491
- Oh, um...wow.
Okay.

21:15.535 --> 21:18.364
- So are you interested?
