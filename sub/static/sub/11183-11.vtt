D.G. Bogard. He's got me. He wants you.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.574
Then maybe he will get me.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.406
He gets you, he gets Airwolf.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.740
I have no compunction

00:33.800 --> 00:35.837
about blowing you and your
machine out of the sky.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.273
(Toni) I am a pilot.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.579
I fly most things, including your chopper.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.552
Hold your positions.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.950
You can't come this way. You'll
wind up in a million pieces.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.351
It's Hawke's choice. Let him die with it.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.061
You killed Hawke!

01:58.051 --> 02:01.328
(narrator) This briefing is from File A56-7W.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.389
Classified: Top Secret

02:02.489 --> 02:04.059
Subject: Airwolf

02:04.124 --> 02:05.865
A Mach 1-plus attack helicopter

02:05.926 --> 02:08.270
with the most advanced weapon
system in the air today.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.808
It's been hidden somewhere
in the western United States

02:10.864 --> 02:12.741
by its test pilot, Stringfellow Hawke.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.437
Hawke has promised to return Airwolf

02:14.501 --> 02:17.914
only if we can find his brother
Sin Jin, an MIA in Vietnam.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.473
We suspect that Archangel,

02:19.573 --> 02:21.746
Deputy Director of the
agency that built Airwolf,

02:21.808 --> 02:24.618
is secretly helping Hawke in
return for Hawke's flying Airwolf

02:24.678 --> 02:26.453
on missions of national concern.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.619
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,
a brilliant combat pilot

02:29.683 --> 02:31.924
and a recluse since his
brother's disappearance.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.760
His only friend is Dominic Santini,

02:33.820 --> 02:36.391
whose air service is the cover
for their government work.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.197
With Hawke and Santini flying as a team,

02:38.258 --> 02:40.101
at speeds rivaling the fastest jets,

02:40.160 --> 02:41.662
backed by unmatched firepower,

02:41.728 --> 02:44.504
Airwolf is too dangerous to be
left in unenlightened hands.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.407
Finding it is your 1st priority.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.187
[controller chattering on radio]

03:05.552 --> 03:07.395
[radio chatter continues]

03:18.365 --> 03:21.244
(controller) 10… 9… 8…

03:21.668 --> 03:23.306
[rocket roaring]

03:23.737 --> 03:25.375
(controller) Main engine start.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.012
And… liftoff.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.925
(Bogard) Men, we have 72 hours.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.530
More than enough time to accomplish

03:46.593 --> 03:49.972
an intensive satellite scan
of the southwest region.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.374
This is the route of the satellite.

03:52.432 --> 03:54.935
It includes all of the possible locations.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.002
[beeping]

03:56.069 --> 03:57.912
It will circle every 92 minutes,

03:57.971 --> 04:01.282
the time decreasing as the
circle tightens and adjusts.

04:01.641 --> 04:03.018
Is that enough time?

04:03.143 --> 04:04.520
That's all I have.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.083
It took all the power of the
department to get me this much.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.422
(Dickens) Sorry, sir.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.053
Since we won't fail,

04:11.718 --> 04:13.720
there's no need to apologize.

04:13.854 --> 04:14.855
[beeping continues]

04:15.055 --> 04:17.500
When the target's been located,

04:17.557 --> 04:20.401
we'll switch to radar and heat-seeking devices

04:20.459 --> 04:23.441
and release the satellite back
to its space agency function.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.238
I assume everything else is on schedule?

04:25.298 --> 04:27.437
The strike force will be
available in 12 hours.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.880
The surveillance and inside
people are already in the area.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.674
Then I'll either destroy Airwolf,

04:34.307 --> 04:36.878
or fly it back to Washington myself.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.184
[jet engines roaring]

04:40.247 --> 04:41.851
[gun firing]

04:42.349 --> 04:44.329
[missile whizzing]

04:46.319 --> 04:47.764
[jet engines roaring]

04:47.821 --> 04:49.664
(Hawke) They sure don't spare any expense

04:49.723 --> 04:51.361
on these war exercises, do they?

04:51.424 --> 04:53.700
(Dominic) This is gonna make
a hell of a training film.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.400
I mean, just wait till you
see that B-52 bomb run.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.807
They chew up everything on that range.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.209
First time I saw one of those Air Force films,

05:01.268 --> 05:03.373
I thought I was back over
in Germany during the war.

05:03.436 --> 05:06.849
Of course, back then we had
Messerschmitts to deal with, you know.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.750
Did you get the shot?

05:08.875 --> 05:10.445
Yeah, I got it.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.481
Great shot, too.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.790
(Archangel) This is Archangel.
Santini I, come in.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.693
I think we died and went to heaven.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.823
We're not scrambled. Where are you?

05:20.887 --> 05:23.060
(Archangel) Take a heading
due west at 50 feet.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.796
You'll find me.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.071
Santini I to Ground Control.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.731
(Ellinson) Come in, Santini I.

05:28.795 --> 05:31.071
(Hawke) I think we shook loose
one of our camera mounts.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.474
Better come down and check 'em.

05:32.532 --> 05:35.069
All right, listen, Sargent Nash is
an expert on air photography.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.046
Come on in, I'll have him give you a hand.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.447
If we need him, we'll use
him. Have him stand by.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.452
(Hawke) We'll just check 'em ourselves first.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.579
Well, remember, we've got a time element here.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.418
(Hawke) Yes, sir, I understand.

05:45.478 --> 05:48.186
We'll do our very best to keep to it. Out.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.429
[birds chirping]

05:52.252 --> 05:54.095
[helicopter approaching]

06:06.566 --> 06:09.638
(Dominic) Do you think he has
that chopper washed every day?

06:09.769 --> 06:12.010
(Hawke) Well, probably with him in it.

06:21.348 --> 06:24.329
I'm working for another
government agency today.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.590
What's so important?

06:25.652 --> 06:29.691
D.G. Bogard. He's got me. He wants you.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.530
So, who's D.G. Bogard?

06:31.591 --> 06:33.867
Department of Public Security.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.871
He's got an Undersecretary title,

06:35.929 --> 06:37.806
but he's actually a top operative.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.707
You're his assignment.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.747
And therefore, the most
important thing in his life.

06:42.802 --> 06:43.837
Don't worry about it.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.212
Easy for you to say.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.717
Difficult for me to do.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.548
It's been tried before, Michael.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.212
Not by this man.

06:50.443 --> 06:53.424
And not with such organization and financing.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.085
Airwolf is about to become the recipient

06:56.149 --> 06:58.789
of a high-intensity satellite survey.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.126
[scoffs]

07:00.220 --> 07:01.324
It's quite a mouthful.

07:01.388 --> 07:04.699
It requires above-average oral dexterity.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.767
However, that doesn't change the fact

07:06.826 --> 07:08.567
that satellite survey photography

07:08.628 --> 07:12.235
of remote sections of the West
Coast could turn up Airwolf.

07:12.299 --> 07:15.542
I can only offer you a printout of the gaps

07:15.602 --> 07:17.411
in the satellite schedule.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.950
You might hide Airwolf in one of those gaps.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.576
I won't be available to you.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.177
I'm sure we'll be able to manage.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.745
Have a nice vacation.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.882
(Marella) He'll be sitting
in a Senate subcommittee

07:26.947 --> 07:28.654
trying to answer a series of allegations

07:28.715 --> 07:30.661
that could be a disaster to the Firm.

07:30.817 --> 07:31.818
Oh?

07:31.885 --> 07:32.886
Bogard?

07:33.086 --> 07:34.087
Yes.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.096
You gonna come out okay, Michael?

07:40.126 --> 07:42.037
I like to think positive.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.403
It's just a stall.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.033
But it leaves you without my cover

07:45.098 --> 07:47.271
for the 72-hour period of the search.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.441
All I could do is warn you.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.711
You're still on your own.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.723
You know, we could always give him Airwolf.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.453
No way in hell!

08:04.317 --> 08:05.557
[chuckles]

08:05.752 --> 08:07.356
[helicopter engine starting]

08:09.089 --> 08:11.592
Santini, we can't afford
to fall behind schedule.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.729
We're synchronized with a B-52 bomb run

08:13.793 --> 08:15.272
that's departing out of Baltimore.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.535
We'll be ready to shoot tomorrow.

08:17.597 --> 08:20.578
Hey man, we'll cash in on
that schedule. Believe me.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.705
Colonel Ellinson doesn't want to hear
about your equipment breakdowns.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.341
Now, the US Government is picking
up the tab for this film.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.010
And they'll get every penny's worth.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.917
I'm here to ensure they do.

08:29.976 --> 08:31.887
It couldn't be in better hands, sir.

08:31.945 --> 08:32.946
[chuckling]

08:35.615 --> 08:37.754
How can you be sure it'll
all be ready by then?

08:37.817 --> 08:40.024
You know, once those 52s
take off, there is no abort.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.293
I mean, these guys fly radio
silent the whole way.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.335
This is a simulated atomic attack.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.429
I got a spare camera mount
that I can rig in a few hours.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.132
I just gotta get to it, that's all.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.106
Look, I'm sorry about your problems,

08:51.164 --> 08:53.235
but I gotta get a better
time schedule to the Colonel

08:53.299 --> 08:55.336
or I'm gonna be the oldest
private in the Air Force.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.143
All right, I'll tell you what you'll do.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.149
Y… you just give me an hour to figure it out,

08:59.205 --> 09:01.151
and I'll radio back. How's that?

09:01.307 --> 09:02.342
[sighing]

09:02.409 --> 09:04.946
Well, I guess I can stay out of
the Colonel's way for an hour.

09:05.011 --> 09:06.752
- You're a gentleman.
- No.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.919
Officers are gentlemen. Sergeants
like me just make things happen.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.360
[chuckling] I owe you.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.739
[helicopter engine whirring]

09:36.076 --> 09:38.113
(Hawke) God, she looks beautiful.

09:39.479 --> 09:42.016
(Dominic) Beautiful or not,
where are we gonna hide it?

09:42.082 --> 09:45.188
(Hawke) In one of those satellite
gaps Archangel showed us.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.390
(Dominic) I still don't see how that satellite

09:47.454 --> 09:48.524
can pick up Airwolf.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.090
(Hawke) High-resolution photography

09:50.156 --> 09:52.227
can look right down a chimney and spot it.

09:54.360 --> 09:59.105
(Toni) Mayday. This is a
mayday. This is 01544 Charlie.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.140
Dominic, you copy that mayday?

10:01.201 --> 10:03.340
I heard it, String. Did you get a bearing?

10:04.370 --> 10:06.782
Yeah. Bearing 285.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.253
Weather radar shows a king-sized cold
front moving in from the northwest.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.357
It takes a special kind of fool
to fly in weather like that.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.257
By the time you get there, it'll be gone.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.419
(Toni) This is a mayday.

10:21.187 --> 10:23.997
[helicopter engine roaring]

10:24.290 --> 10:25.894
[helicopter engine whirring]

10:38.438 --> 10:41.112
[beeping]

10:41.174 --> 10:43.347
Those thunder bumpers have moved off.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.355
And I've just about got him pinned.

10:46.012 --> 10:49.482
Dominic, take a heading of 270.

10:49.549 --> 10:50.721
About 20 miles.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.021
270. You got it.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.724
(Hawke) I can't hang around any longer.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.289
got to hide this thing.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.772
[beeping]

11:24.117 --> 11:27.121
[helicopter engine revving down]

11:43.336 --> 11:45.907
Hey buddy, looks like you made it.

11:46.105 --> 11:47.106
[grunts]

11:47.173 --> 11:49.084
Do I look like a "buddy"?

11:50.410 --> 11:52.412
What the hell is a woman doing out here…

11:52.478 --> 11:53.582
Okay, make up your mind.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.455
You wanna yell at a man or a woman?

11:55.515 --> 11:56.550
Both.

11:56.616 --> 12:01.122
It takes 2 kinds of fool to fly a
Stearman into a storm all alone.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.064
And way out here in the middle of nowhere

12:03.122 --> 12:04.465
and… and… and…
and… and… and…

12:04.524 --> 12:05.525
You done?

12:05.592 --> 12:06.593
Yeah.

12:06.659 --> 12:07.660
Good.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.968
I usually fly alone when
I don't have passengers.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.009
It just sort of works out that way.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.066
[chuckling]

12:13.566 --> 12:16.206
I can see you're not in the mood for subtlety.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.215
What does that mean, that I have to walk?

12:18.271 --> 12:21.013
Walk where? There's nothing
around here for 30 miles.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.180
That's right, and then there's
the Turner Ranch, due east,

12:24.244 --> 12:26.781
sitting in the sun, worn but proud.

12:26.913 --> 12:30.156
Listen, I'd call a limousine, but I… I think
I'm in the wrong neighborhood, you know…

12:30.216 --> 12:32.218
There is no neighborhood.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.286
[laughing]

12:33.620 --> 12:35.930
I mean, am I getting through to you, mister?

12:35.989 --> 12:37.024
Look, lady…

12:37.090 --> 12:38.330
No. Toni. Toni.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.164
Lady, I'm in a rush.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.466
What do you expect me to do,

12:41.527 --> 12:44.098
sit out here and wait for some
cowboy to come riding by?

12:44.163 --> 12:45.369
Look at this place!

12:45.431 --> 12:47.274
I mean, this is a… another planet.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.108
Salvador Dali country.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.243
W… what do I have to do, beg for a ride?

12:53.306 --> 12:56.219
I'll call Air Force Search and Rescue.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.380
They'll come pick you up.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.947
And report my little mishap to the
FAA and my insurance company?

13:01.014 --> 13:02.118
No, thank you.

13:02.181 --> 13:03.785
Listen, if you're not gentleman enough

13:03.850 --> 13:06.729
to help a stranded pilot, then go.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.661
Just go.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.467
Your karma will take care of you.

13:11.658 --> 13:12.659
[sighing]

13:14.427 --> 13:16.566
What are you doing here, anyway?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.939
Either we discuss this

13:18.998 --> 13:21.979
in the comfort of your Jet Ranger,
which no doubt is heated,

13:22.035 --> 13:24.481
or we do not discuss this at all.

13:25.838 --> 13:28.785
I'm shivering and you stand there and gape?

13:31.377 --> 13:33.448
Okay, all right, get in.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.084
Go on, get in. Here, give me that. Come on.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.656
[mumbling]

13:40.420 --> 13:42.229
Don't touch anything.

13:44.857 --> 13:45.961
Here.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.401
[birds chirping]

13:55.635 --> 13:56.636
[sighing]

13:58.304 --> 14:00.580
I thought you were in a rush.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.409
I got a feeling I'm being hijacked.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.581
I don't have a .38 in my bag, Mr. Santini.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.181
You wanna check it?

14:07.246 --> 14:08.725
How'd you know my name?

14:08.781 --> 14:10.454
It's all over your chopper.

14:13.319 --> 14:15.492
Such eloquent eyes.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.226
They tell me you don't trust
strange women casually met.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.538
That's a good character trait.

14:23.262 --> 14:24.297
[sighing]

14:24.364 --> 14:25.741
Who are you?

14:25.832 --> 14:27.743
I thought you'd never ask.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.473
Antonia Donatelli.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.742
And thank you for the rescue.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.346
Antonia Donatelli?

14:34.841 --> 14:36.843
You a nice Italian girl?

14:36.909 --> 14:39.389
Yeah. You a nice Italian boy?

14:39.445 --> 14:40.446
Hey!

14:40.513 --> 14:41.924
[both laughing]

14:42.515 --> 14:44.051
Hey, cinch up, cinch up.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.118
[laughing] Okay.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.686
[laughing] Yeah!

15:14.614 --> 15:16.924
This is beautiful.

15:16.983 --> 15:17.984
You like it?

15:18.050 --> 15:19.154
[laughing] Oh, boy!

15:19.218 --> 15:20.788
How 'bout that lake back there?

15:20.853 --> 15:22.059
That's not bad either.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.232
[both sighing]

15:25.658 --> 15:28.070
Okay. Hey, Tet.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.573
Essence of orchid. I hope you approve.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.966
Listen, you make yourself to home.

15:33.032 --> 15:34.340
I'll be back as soon as I can.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.641
Wait a minute. You just can't abandon me.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.579
Make friends with Tet.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.216
Where are you going? How come I can't come?

15:41.274 --> 15:42.480
When are you coming back?

15:42.542 --> 15:44.180
You ask too many questions.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.587
I can't help if I'm the curious type.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.647
[Tet whining]

15:52.952 --> 15:54.898
(Dominic) I'm 2 miles west of the boneyard.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.865
I'll be there in about 60 seconds.

15:56.923 --> 15:59.460
(Hawke) That's a roger. I'm shuttin’ her down.

15:59.525 --> 16:00.902
Pick me up at the old C-133.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.995
(Dominic) Got it.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.569
Okay, where is it?

16:37.930 --> 16:39.136
Hiding in plain sight.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.505
But I don't see it.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.146
I still don't see it.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.142
That's the idea.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.785
It's wedged in underneath
that C-133 down there.

16:52.879 --> 16:56.053
(Dominic) Oh, yeah, there
she is. Yeah. Looks safe enough.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.625
But it just don't seem right.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.789
Yeah, it's only there for a visit.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.157
(Hawke) As soon as that
satellite's photographed

17:03.222 --> 17:05.429
the Valley of the Gods, we'll move it back.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.001
[hawk screeching]

17:11.564 --> 17:12.565
[sighing]

17:27.380 --> 17:28.859
April 14.

17:30.082 --> 17:33.962
I'm at the cabin of Stringfellow
Hawke, who I have not met.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.029
I was abandoned here by Dominic Santini.

17:37.657 --> 17:41.469
And this cabin is tucked
in between 2 mountaintops.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.281
(Dominic) Sure smells good.

17:53.439 --> 17:54.975
[chuckling]

17:55.274 --> 17:56.912
Ow… ow… ow… ow… ow!

17:57.376 --> 17:59.720
Vitello alla parmigiana?

18:00.179 --> 18:03.922
I'll never say another word against
your cooking. I swear, String.

18:03.983 --> 18:04.984
[chuckling]

18:06.852 --> 18:08.354
It's eggplant.

18:10.189 --> 18:11.497
Eggpl…

18:12.959 --> 18:14.461
Well, anyway, it's Italian.

18:14.527 --> 18:15.938
[both laughing]

18:15.995 --> 18:17.906
Listen, I love vegetarian cooking,

18:17.964 --> 18:19.966
it's just as long as somebody else does it.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.337
Have you always been meatless, Mr. Hawke?

18:23.769 --> 18:24.907
No.

18:30.242 --> 18:33.849
Well, I… I fly prop jets for Tahoe Airlines.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.193
Why are you looking at me like that?

18:38.317 --> 18:39.853
Nothing.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.956
You're skeptical, like Dominic?

18:42.755 --> 18:44.757
Look, it's okay. I get lots of that.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.633
You know, I've even had passengers ask

18:46.692 --> 18:48.729
to see my copilot's certificate.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.034
[Dominic and Toni laughing]

18:50.096 --> 18:51.131
You wanna see it?

18:51.197 --> 18:53.734
[Dominic and Toni laughing]

18:54.200 --> 18:57.374
So, you fly prop jets, and you fly biplanes.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.674
And what else do you do?

18:59.872 --> 19:02.512
I write, in my off time.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.283
Which I have a lot of right now
since I've been furloughed.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.119
The Turners loaned me their guesthouse

19:07.179 --> 19:09.318
so I could finish my novel, so, you know.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.020
Why did you chance the storm?

19:11.083 --> 19:12.824
I don't know, I'm an optimist, I guess.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.558
I just thought I could duck under it.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.725
Under it? Why not over it?

19:18.591 --> 19:20.366
In an open cockpit?

19:21.227 --> 19:23.104
No, thank you.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.163
[laughing]

19:25.431 --> 19:26.637
So, what about you 2?

19:26.699 --> 19:28.679
So are you independently wealthy,

19:28.801 --> 19:30.803
or do you both have rich girlfriends?

19:34.407 --> 19:36.717
W… Well, I… I’ve got an air service and…

19:37.543 --> 19:41.081
Well, I supply planes and
pilots for films and stuff

19:41.380 --> 19:43.087
and String is a pilot.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.662
Oh, boy, that's a fascinating line of work.

19:46.318 --> 19:50.130
I tell you, I am so bored with
straight-and-level milk-run puddle-jumping

19:50.189 --> 19:52.430
I could spit 10-penny nails.

19:52.491 --> 19:53.492
[laughing]

20:00.166 --> 20:04.012
Do you always scowl at your quests
or am I especially deserving?

20:05.738 --> 20:08.014
Is it because I didn't help you cook?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.345
[chuckling]

20:09.408 --> 20:10.409
(Toni) Oh.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.045
Hey, for that I'll do the dishes.

20:14.547 --> 20:18.120
And for that I'll get some firewood.
It's getting chilly in here.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.356
Wanna give me a hand, Dom?

20:19.418 --> 20:21.591
Oh, sure. Excuse me.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.035
[crickets chirping]

20:32.465 --> 20:34.069
She doesn't add up.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.704
There's too many things
happening at once here.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.545
- It's just a coincidence.
- Maybe.

20:39.605 --> 20:42.449
- She was a million miles away from that…
- She snagged you.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.715
She snagged me? All I did was…

20:44.777 --> 20:46.154
Bring her here.

20:46.445 --> 20:47.515
You're right.

20:47.580 --> 20:51.687
Next pretty lady I meet, I'm just
gonna let her freeze to death.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.025
And then I'll introduce her to you.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.191
In the meantime, you just relax.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.168
And you'll live to be the
oldest hermit in the world.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.742
[laughing]

21:07.299 --> 21:10.075
[birds chirping]

21:16.442 --> 21:18.080
I almost forgot my bag.

21:18.144 --> 21:21.353
You almost forgot to close
your fuel drain line, too.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.461
I did? It must've worked
loose. I had it fixed.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.793
But some things are better
replaced than repaired.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.126
Only if you've got the cash.

21:28.187 --> 21:30.167
It's all I can do to keep this baby in fuel.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.257
Is it okay?

21:31.323 --> 21:32.529
Keep an eye on it.

21:32.591 --> 21:35.367
You're wonderful, Dominic Santini.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.776
Thank you, Mr. Hawke.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.075
[grunts]

21:45.371 --> 21:46.577
Will we meet again?

21:46.639 --> 21:47.879
It could happen. Why?

21:48.007 --> 21:49.918
I hope it does. Soon.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.083
Clear.

21:54.780 --> 21:55.986
Clear.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.421
[engine starting]

22:42.595 --> 22:45.303
[Dominic laughing]

22:45.431 --> 22:49.208
Hey, how many pilots do you know that
can handle a Stearman like that?

22:49.335 --> 22:50.678
A whole lot.

22:50.736 --> 22:53.376
Yeah, but are they as beautiful as she is?

22:53.439 --> 22:55.715
[both laughing]

22:58.143 --> 23:00.623
(Ellinson) This is the section
for the saturation bomb run.

23:00.679 --> 23:02.022
It's surrounded by mountains

23:02.081 --> 23:03.856
and the only thing semi-alive in the area

23:03.916 --> 23:05.452
that may get some stray damage

23:05.517 --> 23:07.997
is that aircraft boneyard 20 miles away.

23:08.654 --> 23:11.157
Just how precise is this precision bomb run?

23:11.223 --> 23:14.204
Very. The red zone will be saturated

23:14.360 --> 23:17.933
with the TNT equivalent of one
Hiroshima-sized atomic bomb.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.374
- That's when we fly in.
- Well, no,

23:19.431 --> 23:20.933
we'll give you a couple of minutes

23:21.000 --> 23:22.604
for the turbulence and dirt to settle.

23:22.668 --> 23:23.840
I wouldn't expect anyone

23:23.903 --> 23:25.746
to fly through that concentration of fire.

23:25.804 --> 23:28.910
We'll work on it in editing
and make it look right.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.749
Excuse me a second.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.515
(Dominic) So, then, you suggest
going up to the north canyon…

23:34.580 --> 23:36.321
[clears throat]

23:36.582 --> 23:38.323
Oh, just checking out the camera mounts.

23:38.384 --> 23:40.193
That's quite a setup you got in there.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.596
Yeah, that's a real
precision piece of equipment.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.862
You have to be awful careful,
or you'll shear the pins.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.335
Is that what happened yesterday?

23:46.392 --> 23:47.996
No, we seized a bearing.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.964
Oh, yeah? Where's that?
I didn't see any new bearings.

23:51.563 --> 23:55.033
Well, I'd show you. I… I’d even
be glad to let you operate it,

23:55.100 --> 23:56.545
but Dominic is so…

23:56.602 --> 23:58.513
protective about his equipment.

23:58.737 --> 24:00.808
Yeah, I know how you feel.

24:06.345 --> 24:07.949
See you at 0900.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.354
Let's fire her up.

24:15.421 --> 24:18.095
(Dominic) Well, why are you
flying east? The cabin is west.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.467
I don't think we're up here alone.

24:20.526 --> 24:22.130
A million miles of empty sky

24:22.227 --> 24:24.332
and you think we're being followed?

24:24.396 --> 24:25.875
I know we are.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.469
Bandit on our high 4.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.010
I don't see any bandit.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.073
You will.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.686
I still don't… oh yeah, there.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.519
Hey, but he's heading south.

24:50.556 --> 24:52.001
Not anymore.

24:52.391 --> 24:53.699
Coincidence?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.134
There's no such thing.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.369
What are you looking for?

25:05.237 --> 25:06.238
[clicking]

25:07.006 --> 25:09.646
Hey, what's that? Looks like a thermometer.

25:10.142 --> 25:13.089
Yeah, and she knew right where to stick it.

25:14.713 --> 25:16.454
It's a homing beacon.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.960
Who, Toni?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.894
Oh, come on, wait a minute, will you?

25:19.952 --> 25:21.556
Listen, Nash was around here.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.429
He… he could've planted
that thing, you know…

25:23.489 --> 25:25.469
I didn't see Nash inside.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.467
Let's see if this thing speaks bandit.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.472
(Hawke) Drop down into that canyon.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.343
Let's see if we can lose
him for a few minutes.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.789
(Dominic) I don't see him.

26:01.326 --> 26:02.999
Follow that truck.

26:10.636 --> 26:12.809
(Hawke) Let's see if he'll
follow that load of bacon

26:12.871 --> 26:13.872
instead of us.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.351
Now head back into the canyon.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.519
(Hawke) He's taking the bait.

26:37.062 --> 26:39.838
I'd like to have a word
with our Miss Donatelli.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.243
Why? You think she used me?

26:45.637 --> 26:47.116
[groans]

26:56.248 --> 26:57.522
[birds chirping]

27:23.475 --> 27:25.216
[helicopter approaching]

27:42.628 --> 27:45.802
[engine revving down]

27:51.303 --> 27:53.544
Boy, you 2 sure do get around.

27:53.605 --> 27:56.313
Isn't this place beautiful after a storm?

27:56.375 --> 27:57.752
You lied to me.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.481
Okay, this place isn't
beautiful after a storm.

28:00.546 --> 28:02.184
(Dominic) Why did you lie to me?

28:02.414 --> 28:03.916
What's the matter, Dominic?

28:05.918 --> 28:08.194
All right, all right, s… straight goods.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.733
I followed you. And then I
lost you in the weather.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.097
I faked the mayday at first.

28:12.157 --> 28:13.192
At first?

28:13.258 --> 28:14.601
There's a good reason for it.

28:14.660 --> 28:17.436
I've been trying to reach you at the
studio. No one would put me through.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.237
I called the hangar. No one's ever there.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.709
I have an answering machine.

28:20.899 --> 28:24.745
Did you ever try to convince an
answering machine to give you a job?

28:33.545 --> 28:35.957
I… I did lie to you about one thing.

28:36.915 --> 28:39.486
I said I was on furlough with
that airline job at Tahoe.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.552
Well, I'm not.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.527
I've been pink-slipped

28:42.588 --> 28:44.829
because I wouldn't play
house with the Chief Pilot.

28:45.123 --> 28:48.070
That's something you male pilots
don't have to contend with, I hope.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.163
It's awful hard to feel sorry for somebody

28:50.229 --> 28:53.767
who is hedgehopping around the
country having fun playing pilot.

28:53.832 --> 28:55.311
I am a pilot.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.938
I fly most things, including your chopper.

28:58.003 --> 29:01.177
See, I don't own a car or a house
or… or any fancy wardrobe.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.015
This plane is it.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.021
I don't want sympathy. I wanna fly.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.057
For Dominic or for anybody who'll hire me

29:07.112 --> 29:09.353
without putting their paw prints all over me.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.156
Let's go.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.860
I followed you Dominic, to meet you,

29:17.923 --> 29:20.096
to show you what I can do with the Stearman.

29:20.158 --> 29:22.900
After the first mayday, I
really did have engine trouble.

29:22.961 --> 29:24.338
It's my karma, I guess.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.932
But then I was lost and scared.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.410
You saw me shaking. That wasn't just the cold.

29:31.603 --> 29:35.710
Did you lose a beacon, a homing
beacon out of your flight bag?

29:35.774 --> 29:37.048
A… a beacon?

29:37.476 --> 29:38.887
Dom, let's go.

29:40.545 --> 29:41.546
Look…

29:43.248 --> 29:45.694
n… next time, s… send a résumé.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.746
You don't believe her, do you?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.583
I think she's lying.

30:11.843 --> 30:13.618
Right through her pretty white teeth.

30:13.845 --> 30:16.052
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.458
I saw something different in that lady's eyes.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.293
Something nice, something honest.

30:21.553 --> 30:24.329
(Hawke) Yeah, she's bright.
She's quick on her feet.

30:24.389 --> 30:26.995
And she pushes all the
right buttons with you.

30:28.126 --> 30:31.198
You're seeing agents and double
agents coming out of the woodwork.

30:31.263 --> 30:35.211
And satellites, mystery
choppers, and homing devices.

30:53.118 --> 30:56.156
[clock ticking]

31:04.363 --> 31:06.707
[helicopter approaching]

31:59.718 --> 32:02.824
I think it is time we reached
some sort of settlement.

32:13.331 --> 32:15.140
(Bogard) It's really quite simple.

32:15.200 --> 32:18.738
I'm giving you the opportunity
to capitulate in private.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.640
I want Airwolf.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.344
You can give it to me or I can take it.

32:23.408 --> 32:27.083
Officially, all I can say is I don't
know what you're talking about.

32:29.481 --> 32:32.655
Now that you've totally convinced
me of your absolute innocence,

32:32.717 --> 32:34.526
I'd like an answer.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.524
Where is Airwolf?

32:36.855 --> 32:38.232
Well, standing in a grocery line,

32:38.290 --> 32:42.432
I hear it's somewhere between
modern history and current events.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.905
Airwolf was destroyed in
Libya a few months ago.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.943
And Archangel will be destroyed

32:46.998 --> 32:49.911
by a Senate subcommittee in a few days.

32:50.435 --> 32:53.905
One reason being, his conspiracy
with you, in hiding Airwolf.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.974
Let's cut down the words.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.121
Archangel isn't my responsibility.

32:58.176 --> 32:59.712
He can take care of himself.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.157
Not in this instance.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.129
He's over-matched and so are you.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.094
Maybe so.

33:10.455 --> 33:13.265
I don't know much about this
spy game. You're the expert.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.770
All I know is, as good as you are,

33:14.826 --> 33:16.999
if I'd done anything wrong,
you'd have got me by now.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.564
My satellite will.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.136
Well, you lost me again.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.476
I know Archangel informed you.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.547
It's another nail in his professional coffin.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.381
The printouts are no longer of any value.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.582
The orbit's been adjusted.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.989
It's only a matter of another few
hours before we locate Airwolf.

33:39.050 --> 33:41.030
So then why are you here?

33:43.355 --> 33:47.326
I don't want you to think you have
no options and destroy Airwolf.

33:47.392 --> 33:50.635
You've got a "bring 'em back alive"
clause in your contract?

33:50.695 --> 33:53.369
Destroying it would be considered a success.

33:53.431 --> 33:55.775
But that's not my dilemma. It's yours.

33:56.334 --> 33:59.440
I'm close on you. Very close.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.710
When and if you decide to throw that switch,

34:02.774 --> 34:06.051
how many American agents
will you be blowing up with?

34:06.378 --> 34:08.380
I'm not much into hunting.

34:08.713 --> 34:09.851
But I like to fish.

34:09.915 --> 34:11.087
Back off, Hawke!

34:11.382 --> 34:14.125
You know, I think you just
made yourself a trespasser.

34:14.185 --> 34:17.132
I covered this visit with
a Federal search warrant.

34:18.156 --> 34:20.601
I even had the right to break in.

34:21.927 --> 34:24.373
Aren't you goin' a little haywire?

34:25.196 --> 34:27.107
Sounds like to me you're just involved

34:27.165 --> 34:29.145
in an inter-departmental squabble.

34:29.333 --> 34:32.042
If you win, you become the office hero.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.674
You can't win.

34:37.108 --> 34:38.246
Maybe.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.688
There's a difference between us,
that makes me much stronger.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.054
I have no compunction

34:43.114 --> 34:45.594
about blowing you and your
machine out of the sky.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.960
I don't believe you could do the same.

34:51.989 --> 34:53.764
We'll never know, will we?

34:55.393 --> 34:56.667
We might.

35:21.319 --> 35:23.799
Santini Air. Santini Air.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.628
Come on in, Dom.

35:28.493 --> 35:30.871
(Dominic) You got something against sleep?

35:31.596 --> 35:34.634
No, just plan on getting a few hours less.

35:34.899 --> 35:36.572
Got to push our call up.

35:37.035 --> 35:39.208
Got some things to take care of.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.083
I’ll be there.

35:41.506 --> 35:42.507
See you then.

35:44.442 --> 35:47.013
[beeping]

36:16.408 --> 36:18.513
(Hawke) I just had a nightmare pay me a visit.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.921
His name was D.G. Bogard.

36:20.979 --> 36:23.220
(Dominic) Bogard? At the cabin?

36:23.348 --> 36:24.725
I'm beginning to feel

36:24.783 --> 36:27.263
like there are eyes everywhere, Dom.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.262
It's not creeping paranoia.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.163
Well, if they are watching you,

36:31.256 --> 36:32.929
how can you move Airwolf?

36:33.458 --> 36:34.766
I've got an idea.

36:38.463 --> 36:39.942
Anybody home?

36:40.231 --> 36:41.574
[birds chirping]

36:43.134 --> 36:44.306
[hinges squeaking]

36:44.369 --> 36:45.871
What's the matter?

36:45.937 --> 36:47.939
Did you forget to kick me the other day?

36:48.006 --> 36:50.077
Are you qualified on Jet Rangers?

36:50.375 --> 36:52.548
I don't know. I'm not in the market for one.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.988
I'm selling a job, not choppers.

36:55.313 --> 36:56.724
For me?

36:56.781 --> 36:58.283
What? Y… you see a crowd?

36:59.150 --> 37:00.151
[sighing]

37:00.985 --> 37:03.363
You better leave the smart
aleck remarks to me.

37:03.421 --> 37:04.456
When do I start?

37:04.522 --> 37:06.468
Right now. Get some shoes on.

37:06.791 --> 37:09.067
And what about that arrogant
self-imposed hermit

37:09.127 --> 37:10.800
you usually fly with?

37:10.862 --> 37:13.706
Look, you want the job or you
just want to insult my friends?

37:13.765 --> 37:15.676
Could I have ‘em both?

37:15.734 --> 37:17.008
[laughing]

37:20.805 --> 37:22.546
(Dickens) We're down to an 18-mile radius.

37:22.607 --> 37:24.314
Airwolf is somewhere in there.

37:24.609 --> 37:26.179
When we're within the 10-mile circle,

37:26.244 --> 37:27.814
we can switch to our own equipment.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.222
We won't need the satellite.

37:31.149 --> 37:32.219
Ready.

37:32.283 --> 37:34.388
I just set zipped the rug for you.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.092
You never can tell when it's gonna rain again.

37:37.155 --> 37:38.566
Thanks, Dom.

38:41.286 --> 38:42.560
[beeping]

38:42.654 --> 38:44.463
(Dickens) Mr. Bogard!

38:45.190 --> 38:47.568
We got a couple of blips in and
around the search pattern.

38:47.625 --> 38:48.626
What are they?

38:48.693 --> 38:50.229
The one off the pattern is a chopper.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.434
Probably the Santini unit
headed for the film site.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.943
The other one is a light plane,
came from the Turner Ranch.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.706
Donatelli? It looks like it.

38:56.901 --> 38:59.108
They're headed into our search area.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.774
Have 2 units keep her under visual.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.250
I'm going up.

39:03.208 --> 39:04.516
Let's go.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.021
(Ellinson) Sorry for the delay, Mr. Santini,

39:08.079 --> 39:10.252
but our bomber flight flew an evasive action.

39:10.315 --> 39:12.795
We get as much as we can
from these training missions.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.091
How much of a delay?

39:14.152 --> 39:16.257
You can find your altitude
and await the final order.

39:16.321 --> 39:17.356
I'll be on my mark.

39:17.422 --> 39:19.299
I'll be your ground control.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.234
Radio expert. Camera expert.

39:21.292 --> 39:23.203
Boy, you're overqualified, Nash.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.813
[tires screeching]

39:52.156 --> 39:56.605
Command One. We've got a contact
point: bearing 126, left quadrant.

39:58.696 --> 40:02.166
Ground units, tighten the
circle to a 2-mile radius.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.142
Do not acknowledge.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.910
Air units, start a crossing pattern.

40:06.971 --> 40:08.450
We are on a visual.

40:15.713 --> 40:18.694
[wind howling]

40:19.984 --> 40:21.088
[hissing]

40:22.053 --> 40:24.294
[beeping]

40:28.293 --> 40:30.398
[helicopter engine starting]

41:22.180 --> 41:24.023
(Bogard) To all ground units:

41:24.082 --> 41:27.723
Cross reference points Delta 21 and Tango 7.

41:27.785 --> 41:31.198
Converge aircraft boneyard. We have him.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.207
(Bogard) And here we are, Mr. Hawke, at last.

41:38.262 --> 41:42.335
Surely you did not expect a simple
deception to throw me off the scent?

41:42.600 --> 41:43.670
Who tipped you off?

41:43.735 --> 41:45.612
(Bogard) Oh, I can't tell you that.

41:51.809 --> 41:53.618
(Bogard) Don't try it, Hawke.

41:59.951 --> 42:03.228
You can't do it without bringing
us and you down together.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.425
Don't tempt me.

42:05.490 --> 42:07.697
(Bogard) Give it up, Hawke,
there is nothing you can do.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.397
And what if I refuse?

42:09.794 --> 42:13.003
(Bogard) Then I've got a pair
of F-4s sitting on a high cap.

42:24.575 --> 42:26.748
[helicopter engines roaring]

42:44.262 --> 42:46.173
Get yourself off the range, Dom.

42:46.230 --> 42:49.234
I'm headed your way with Bogard's
huntin’ dogs on my tail.

42:53.304 --> 42:55.477
Somebody tipped him off about the switch.

42:56.040 --> 42:57.610
I’ll bet I know who.

42:57.675 --> 42:59.313
(Dominic) You may be right.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.818
But listen, String, you can't come this way.

43:01.879 --> 43:04.052
Those B-52s are about to let go.

43:04.115 --> 43:05.492
That's just what I'm counting on.

43:05.683 --> 43:07.356
But you'll wind up in a million pieces!

43:09.987 --> 43:11.330
Well, wish me luck.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.903
We got to stop the bombers.

43:32.477 --> 43:34.252
(Bogard) Keep after him.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.492
(pilot #1) Black Leader, this is Silver One.

43:37.548 --> 43:39.994
We have the target in sight
and will stay with him.

43:45.990 --> 43:48.095
We can't possibly catch him, Mr. Bogard.

43:48.226 --> 43:50.331
(Bogard) He can’t run from
‘em, just keep going.

44:07.345 --> 44:09.052
(pilot #2) He went in!

44:09.180 --> 44:10.887
It's a bluff. He'll pullout.

44:15.386 --> 44:17.992
Okay, Bogard, come and get me.

44:18.890 --> 44:20.836
(pilot #1) Black Leader, this is Silver One.

44:20.892 --> 44:22.701
We have B-52s dead ahead.

44:23.961 --> 44:27.135
(pilot #3) Black Leader, Silver
Flight breaking off pursuit.

44:27.498 --> 44:29.171
Return to the pursuit.

44:29.233 --> 44:30.940
Get back here. That's an order.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.383
(Bogard) This is your last chance, Hawke.

44:36.541 --> 44:38.487
You can live or you can die.

44:38.543 --> 44:40.113
Either way, I win.

44:40.178 --> 44:42.055
Just listen to that man, Colonel.

44:42.113 --> 44:43.786
He's out of his mind.

44:43.848 --> 44:46.260
You've got to send that
cancel code to those bombers

44:46.317 --> 44:48.524
before it's too late.

44:50.621 --> 44:52.464
Nash, what are you doing? I'm sorry, sir.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.366
Give me that mike. That's an order.

44:54.425 --> 44:56.598
I have to relieve you of
your operational command, sir.

44:56.661 --> 44:58.732
Mr. Bogard will make the
decision on the bombing run.

44:58.796 --> 45:00.298
Who the hell is Bogard?

45:00.431 --> 45:02.968
He's the Undersecretary of the
Department of Public Security,

45:03.034 --> 45:05.105
and my boss.

45:05.169 --> 45:06.580
Black Leader, this is Nash.

45:06.637 --> 45:08.674
What are your orders on the bombing run?

45:09.073 --> 45:11.451
(Bogard) Do NOT cancel the bombers.

45:11.509 --> 45:15.013
It's Hawke's choice. Let him die with it.

45:16.214 --> 45:17.215
Colonel!

45:25.790 --> 45:26.860
Are you Bogard?

45:26.924 --> 45:29.200
Yes. And I'm taking charge of this operation.

45:35.166 --> 45:37.772
[bombs whistling]

46:51.876 --> 46:53.685
[explosions echoing]

46:58.783 --> 46:59.921
No.

47:02.253 --> 47:03.891
You killed Hawke!

47:03.954 --> 47:05.729
I take full responsibility.

47:05.790 --> 47:07.167
You sure will!

47:07.224 --> 47:09.033
Sergeant, arrest these 2 men!

47:09.093 --> 47:10.834
No way you can hold me.

47:10.895 --> 47:13.569
I've got a room with a padlock.
What more do I need?

47:24.208 --> 47:26.085
(Hawke) Br'er Rabbit to Br'er Fox.

47:29.447 --> 47:31.927
String, are you okay?

47:33.617 --> 47:35.858
(Hawke) I was born in that briar patch.

47:38.923 --> 47:39.924
[exclaiming]

47:39.990 --> 47:40.991
[laughing]

47:42.460 --> 47:43.461
[screeching]

47:43.561 --> 47:45.438
(Hawke) You know, I've never did like

47:45.496 --> 47:47.407
the way that doggone Airwolf helmet fit.

47:47.598 --> 47:49.271
But I'd sure never complain again

47:49.333 --> 47:51.074
after the way that visor slid right down

47:51.135 --> 47:52.705
just in time to protect my eyes.

47:52.770 --> 47:54.909
It's activated by extremely bright light,

47:55.005 --> 47:57.144
a… a precaution against flash blindness.

47:57.341 --> 47:58.979
(Archangel) You are a lucky man.

47:59.043 --> 48:01.580
I just wish I could have seen
the look on Bogard's face

48:01.645 --> 48:03.352
when he was arrested.

48:03.414 --> 48:05.655
By a lowly Air Force Colonel.

48:06.317 --> 48:10.493
That lowly Air Force Colonel has
turned out to be pretty tenacious.

48:10.888 --> 48:14.961
He's got Bogard running scared,
with a little help from me.

48:16.827 --> 48:17.965
(Toni) Hi.

48:18.429 --> 48:21.342
You all finished with your
classified whispering now?

48:21.399 --> 48:23.379
Hi, Toni. Come on, sit down, sit down.

48:23.434 --> 48:24.777
Okay.

48:24.969 --> 48:27.108
Just one last thing.

48:27.505 --> 48:29.280
Now that we've finally established

48:29.340 --> 48:31.183
that you aren't looking for Bogard,

48:31.242 --> 48:34.052
I'd like to say that you are
exactly the sort of person

48:34.111 --> 48:36.216
my Firm is interested in recruiting.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.419
Just a minute there, Whitey.

48:38.482 --> 48:39.688
[Marella laughing]

48:39.750 --> 48:42.629
It just so happens that Toni
is coming to work for me

48:42.686 --> 48:46.190
as my top assistant stunt pilot. Right?

48:47.725 --> 48:48.999
[tittering] Well…

48:50.795 --> 48:52.866
[laughing] Oh, boy!

48:56.300 --> 48:57.506
[all laughing]

48:58.305 --> 49:04.648
