00:01.653 --> 00:05.744
- Previously, on
"Porsha's family Matters"...

00:05.788 --> 00:07.398
- Happy birthday!

00:07.442 --> 00:08.834
- Forty is it.

00:08.878 --> 00:11.011
See if you can get how
that table sits right there.

00:12.577 --> 00:16.494
Simon, my fiance,
only has eyes for Porsha.

00:16.538 --> 00:19.062
Got engaged on Thursday,
and Simon and I thought

00:19.106 --> 00:21.325
that the judge
was going to stamp

00:21.369 --> 00:24.459
and finalize it
on that Friday.

00:24.502 --> 00:27.288
Monday came.
It was not done.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.985
- How long were y'all talking
before y'all were engaged?

00:29.029 --> 00:30.943
- Um, right at a month.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.336
- You taking that
picture together

00:32.380 --> 00:34.556
made me feel like
you were supportive.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.210
- It looked like
she took somebody's man.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.689
That's what it
looked like to me.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.213
- I know it does.
Yeah.

00:39.256 --> 00:40.431
- Porsha gonna look like
the man stealer of the century.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.129
She may go in the Hall of Fame
for that sh--,

00:42.172 --> 00:44.870
to be honest wit' you.

00:44.914 --> 00:48.831
- Yes, hi, family!

- Hey.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.292
- Girl, it's raining out there.

01:15.336 --> 01:16.728
- Well, good your hair is big.

01:16.772 --> 01:17.294
- I didn't know that,
so I was just about to say.

01:17.338 --> 01:18.469
- That's good.

01:18.513 --> 01:19.862
- I was just gonna say
I don't even care

01:19.905 --> 01:20.732
'cause it'll just curl my stuff
right back on up.

01:20.776 --> 01:21.777
- Yeah.
No, it's so cute.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.213
- Oh, hi.
- Shots.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.258
- Here you are.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.085
- Oh, wow, they do
the shots now.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.477
- Shot, shot, shot.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.175
- These are not the birthday
shots we been doin'.

01:28.218 --> 01:29.393
- Your birthday is over.

01:29.437 --> 01:30.394
We're not doing
birthday shots anymore.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.613
- My birthday is not over.

01:31.656 --> 01:32.396
- We're not doing
birthday shots anymore.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.789
- We have one more thing.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.747
They're still celebrating who?

01:35.791 --> 01:37.140
- Child, I'm tired.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.316
- Ooh, ooh,
who is it celebrating?

01:39.360 --> 01:42.798
Tomorrow is the last of
the Porsha birthday festivities.

01:42.841 --> 01:47.019
It will be a cookout for
my family and a couple friends.

01:47.063 --> 01:51.154
This is the last hoorah.
A bitch is tired.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.287
- We've been partying for you
all week,

01:53.330 --> 01:58.988
but as your sister,
I went to go talk to Dennis.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.816
- Okay, so, what happened?
How was it?

02:00.859 --> 02:04.428
- So, this whole deal with him
not being able to bring a date,

02:04.472 --> 02:05.821
I kinda told him
he could bring a date

02:05.864 --> 02:07.518
if he came on Sunday.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.653
- Why would that be
a good idea?

02:11.696 --> 02:13.655
- I don't know
if it's a good idea but--

02:13.698 --> 02:14.699
- Why did you do it?

02:14.743 --> 02:15.831
- Because we're
all being open.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.963
We're being honest.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.140
- You fittin' to think
I'm gonna let some random woman

02:20.183 --> 02:22.272
come up in my house,
sit at my dinner table,

02:22.316 --> 02:25.188
at my house, with my man.
Uh-uh.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.147
I mean, um...

02:27.190 --> 02:29.192
- Oh, do you see
what I'm saying?

02:29.236 --> 02:31.107
Your feelings are getting--
- I meant what--

02:31.151 --> 02:32.717
I meant-- I meant--
re-scratch that.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.415
- Just stop.
- I didn't mean my man.

02:34.458 --> 02:39.376
I meant, my-- my--
my fiance.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.856
- Dennis said you're
still in love with him.

02:40.899 --> 02:41.987
- I--
- Dennis said

02:42.031 --> 02:43.293
you're still in love
with him, okay?

02:43.337 --> 02:44.294
And that's what it's giving,
and that's what--

02:44.338 --> 02:45.121
and that's-- that's--
- Stop.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.644
No, I don't like this.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.733
I love my fiance.
- You do. Exactly.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.170
- I'm happy with him.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.041
I don't want him to even start
questioning nothing

02:52.084 --> 02:53.303
about me and
Dennis' relationship.

02:53.347 --> 02:54.913
- Maybe you need to
talk to Simon

02:54.957 --> 02:56.176
and see where his head is.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.178
- I don't want to
because I want to do

02:58.221 --> 03:01.398
what I want to do.
It's very simple.

03:01.442 --> 03:04.184
- Her blended family version
is starting to seem

03:04.227 --> 03:06.534
a little selfish because
she wants everybody

03:06.577 --> 03:07.883
in the position
she wants them in,

03:07.926 --> 03:10.190
so we can play the part
she wants us to play.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.409
Social media has been a lot.

03:12.453 --> 03:15.020
- Did you hold his feet
to the fire for that post?

03:15.064 --> 03:16.500
- Mm-hmm.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.110
You're the one that wrote
on her post, talking about some,

03:18.154 --> 03:20.591
"Ooh, I forgot
you was engaged."

03:21.940 --> 03:24.465
I'm not-- I'm not--
I'm not high fiving this.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.118
Okay, that was messy.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.337
I think it's time to unplug.

03:27.381 --> 03:30.297
So, I think we should
go on a retreat.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.255
There's been a lot of drama
around social media

03:32.299 --> 03:33.996
and your life recently.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.650
It's spilled over onto me.

03:35.693 --> 03:38.130
Shoot, the only reason
Nate doesn't like Simon

03:38.174 --> 03:39.523
is because of social media.

03:39.567 --> 03:43.223
- Don't nobody care nothin'
about what Nate say.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.615
Nate is a sore spot for me.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.530
It's-- it's--
I don't like it.

03:46.574 --> 03:47.923
- What do you mean?
I just lost my boyfriend.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.707
I've been crying all week
because I've been in

03:49.751 --> 03:50.839
with somebody a year and half.
- I-- I know.

03:50.882 --> 03:51.970
- It's not about you.
It's about me.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.276
- I'm not saying
it's about me, Lauren.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.321
- Oh, my God!
So, stop making it about you.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.322
- Right now.
- I'm sad.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.671
Let me be sad.

03:56.714 --> 03:59.543
- So, my sister is in
an on again,

03:59.587 --> 04:02.720
off again relationship
with her boyfriend, Nate.

04:02.764 --> 04:07.072
I just feel like there's not
as many happy moments

04:07.116 --> 04:08.030
as there should be.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.468
- Well, first of all,
nobody should be yelling at you.

04:11.512 --> 04:15.167
Why would he be uncomfortable
with you meeting with Simon

04:15.211 --> 04:16.778
about my birthday?

04:21.870 --> 04:24.960
- Can I not, as your sister,
say I don't think

04:25.003 --> 04:26.353
he's good for you?

04:32.446 --> 04:35.710
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.236
- Like, I should just be fine

04:40.280 --> 04:41.542
because we weren't
meant to be together.

04:41.585 --> 04:42.978
It's not that easy.

04:43.021 --> 04:46.286
- Okay, you're right.
I shouldn't say that, okay?

04:46.329 --> 04:47.635
You have a right to feel
how you feel,

04:47.678 --> 04:50.986
and I may have overstepped.
I'm sorry, okay?

04:51.029 --> 04:52.509
I'm in it, too.

04:52.553 --> 04:56.774
We'll go outta town and
get back to a place of truth.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.695
- You ready?

05:04.739 --> 05:06.697
You wanna go in here
and find you some toys?

05:07.872 --> 05:10.092
- Whatever you want.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.267
Come on.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.877
- Hi. How are you?
- Good. How are you?

05:12.921 --> 05:14.488
- Good, good.
- Good. How you doin'?

05:14.531 --> 05:15.663
- Let me know
if you guys need anything,

05:15.706 --> 05:17.186
and I'll be around.
- All right, cool.

05:17.229 --> 05:18.492
- Okay, thanks.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.842
- Here, put her down.
Let's see what you like.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.323
- There's so much
to pick from, PJ.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.976
- You want this, baby?
Okay. All right.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.544
Put this up front.

05:27.588 --> 05:28.980
What?
- What you want, poo?

05:29.024 --> 05:31.113
That right there?
- This?

05:31.156 --> 05:32.462
You don't want this?
All right.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.159
What about this?
- Build a burger.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.640
That should be build a hot dog,
not build a burger.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.207
- Okay, there we go.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.556
You got my phone?
- I do.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.515
- Here, what about this, baby?

05:41.558 --> 05:43.995
Ever since I commented
about Porsha photo,

05:44.039 --> 05:45.693
my phone been blowing up.

05:45.736 --> 05:48.391
Social media, man,
people just take one thing,

05:48.435 --> 05:50.654
and it just go outta control.
- What?

05:50.698 --> 05:53.962
- I was like, oh, you know,
P, why-why you looking fine?

05:54.005 --> 05:55.877
I forgot you was married.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.008
- Oh, okay.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.793
You know what that, uh,
tells people

05:58.836 --> 06:00.490
a little bit, right?
- What?

06:00.534 --> 06:02.274
- They may think
you're still interested.

06:02.318 --> 06:05.190
- No, it was a joke.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.410
I made sure I called Simon
and made sure he was cool.

06:07.454 --> 06:08.890
- Well, you did
the right thing.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.718
You-- you apologized.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.896
- I mean,
I thought it was funny.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.420
I was trolling, too,
at the same time.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.727
She did just get engaged,
like, a week ago, right?

06:21.642 --> 06:24.471
It got outta hand fast.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.255
- Do you think she truly
in love with this guy?

06:26.298 --> 06:28.431
- She says she is.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.868
- She said that about you.
- She was.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.044
- Oh, okay.
So, think she moving too fast?

06:34.219 --> 06:35.395
- Yeah, she's definitely
moving too fast.

06:35.438 --> 06:36.657
I mean, I think that's--

06:37.788 --> 06:39.224
- Since day one,
it's always just been

06:39.268 --> 06:44.316
some tension between, you know,
mama and baby mama.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.580
- So, how do y'all feel
about prenups?

06:46.623 --> 06:48.930
Oh, take a drink.
Uh-oh.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.367
Have a private ceremony
and get married.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.716
- We ain't having
no shotgun wedding.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.849
- Did you wanna be
a baby mama or wife?

06:54.892 --> 06:57.547
- I'm far from a baby mama
'cause I'm already a fiance.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.723
I mean, your mom
didn't call me.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.030
I felt like I shoulda gotten
a different type of support.

07:02.073 --> 07:04.032
- It's always just been a, like,
a little gnat.

07:04.075 --> 07:06.600
They just keep, you know,
buzzing around.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.602
It's always just been--
been somethin'.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.430
- Are you going to
the event tomorrow?

07:10.473 --> 07:12.040
- Why do I wanna go to
a cookout over there?

07:12.083 --> 07:14.042
I can't bring no work with me.
What am I doing over there?

07:18.873 --> 07:20.265
I'm 'posed to play footsies
with Lauren?

07:20.309 --> 07:21.310
What am I gonna do?

07:21.353 --> 07:22.833
- She wants you
to pick her up.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.487
Why should it a problem
if you bring a date?

07:24.531 --> 07:25.923
- I don't know.
Maybe you should ask her.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.230
- Yeah, maybe I will.
- Ha-ha-ha!

07:28.273 --> 07:29.492
You is messy.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.929
- If my son shows up
with a new date,

07:31.973 --> 07:33.931
I'm pretty sure
she's gonna get upset about it

07:33.975 --> 07:36.020
because she needs to
control everything.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.413
Life goes on.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.197
She shouldn't be
intimidated about that.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.461
She's not her new man, right?

07:41.504 --> 07:45.290
- Come on.

07:45.334 --> 07:46.683
All right.
Ring me up.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.425

I'm fourth marriage.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.499
- Oh, my Lord.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.936
- Awkward--
it's so awkward.

08:33.817 --> 08:36.385
- Oh, no.

08:36.428 --> 08:39.344
Oh, I don't wanna
pop any more of 'em.

08:44.088 --> 08:46.874
- Go ahead in, baby.

08:49.050 --> 08:53.576
- Mama, you look
beautiful, mommy.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.492
- Hi.
How are you?

08:56.536 --> 09:00.452
- Y'all look like boho chic.
I missed the memo.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.585
I'm a little off,
but I still look good.

09:07.372 --> 09:08.112
I can feel the air condition.
Can you feel it?

09:08.156 --> 09:09.374
I can feel it blowing.

09:11.028 --> 09:13.596
- Probably.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.350
- Hi, guys.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.091
Hi. Simon.
- Rohan-- nice to meet you.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.353
- Nice to meet you.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.529
I guess I haven't met
all the cousins yet.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.271
Hi, cousin. How are you?
- I'm good.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.012
- Hi. Simon.
- How you doin'?

09:38.055 --> 09:39.709
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

09:39.753 --> 09:42.320
- I absolutely feel welcomed
into Porsha's family,

09:42.364 --> 09:45.149
but this is very recent,
very quick.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.281
At the end of the day,

09:46.324 --> 09:48.065
I'm still the new guy
on the block.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.850
Let me find a chair.
Oh, no, no, don't you worry.

09:49.893 --> 09:52.548
I'll grab one over here.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.856
- Hey.
- Hey, can you do this?

09:55.899 --> 09:57.640
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, cool.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.033
I'm excited that's
the last party.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.861
Is that bad?
- Girl, me, too.

10:00.904 --> 10:01.862
I can't get it.

10:01.905 --> 10:02.732
- Oh, I'm doing
too much anyway.

10:02.776 --> 10:03.733
I've been up here for a while.

10:03.777 --> 10:04.821
You know,
you start loading up.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.475
- Oh, yeah.
No, don't do too much.

10:06.518 --> 10:09.260
Wait.
I actually came up here.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.262
I need to give you a gift.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.874
- What you got?

10:13.917 --> 10:16.050
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:16.093 --> 10:19.227
- So, this is my gift to you.
- Hey!

10:20.228 --> 10:21.664
- How are you?

10:23.100 --> 10:25.233
I'm doing good.
Good to see you.

10:25.276 --> 10:27.670
- So, I was getting you
a certificate

10:27.714 --> 10:28.932
for a session with Lena.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.412
- Oh.
- Yes.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.458
Lena is my meditation teacher
and my mentor.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.112
Currently, I don't work
for Porsha right now

10:35.156 --> 10:37.549
in any capacity.
We own Naked Hair together,

10:37.593 --> 10:39.726
but after eight years
with the company,

10:39.769 --> 10:41.815
I decided to leave
to pursue my own thing.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.774
I'm focusing all of my creative
and professional energy

10:44.818 --> 10:46.341
on yoga and meditation.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.517
Maybe we'll come by
one day this week, too.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.042
- Okay, thank you.
- Muah.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.522
- Bye.
- Great.

10:53.565 --> 10:54.784
So, why did you choose that
to be my birthday gift?

10:54.828 --> 10:56.612
- You know, Lena is
a spiritual counselor.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.005
She's also
a trained therapist.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.615
- Yeah.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.271
- And, um, but she focuses on
your feminine divine power.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.229
- All right.
Well, that's the best gift

11:05.273 --> 11:06.535
I ever coulda asked for.
- Good.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.277
For me,
therapy was transformative.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.540
What Lena has taught me
takes it a step further.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.281
So, I want to introduce it
to my family

11:13.324 --> 11:15.457
because I want them
to be happy and healthy, too.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.111
I was actually talked to
Londie the other day

11:17.154 --> 11:18.765
about her dad
just passing.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.114
She broke down in tears.

11:20.157 --> 11:22.464
- So, she needs
to be on this trip.

11:22.507 --> 11:23.508
- Yes.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.988
A lot of the women
in our family

11:25.032 --> 11:26.686
they're expressing things
that they're going through.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.339
I think giving them
a safe place

11:28.383 --> 11:30.211
to express themselves
is really important.

11:30.254 --> 11:31.299
- A mutual friend of ours

11:31.342 --> 11:33.780
has a horse farm
in South Carolina.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.957
- Well, Simon, Simon, Simon.
- Hey, auntie. How are you?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.393
- So, Simon...
- Yes, ma'am.

11:38.436 --> 11:41.265
- You gon' keep this wife?

11:42.223 --> 11:43.485
- For life.

11:43.528 --> 11:48.142
- I know Nigerian men
like to change up now.

11:48.185 --> 11:49.796
- This is gonna be
just Porsha?

11:49.839 --> 11:50.840
- I'm a one man, one wife.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.102
- Hey, y'all.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.974
- You don't want the aunties
to come for you.

11:54.017 --> 11:56.890
- Hi. Hello.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.979
- How you doin'?
- Good.

11:59.022 --> 12:01.764
- Oh, it's the
birthday girl!

12:01.808 --> 12:03.418
Yay.
- Hi, baby. Muah.

12:03.461 --> 12:04.767
-
- Thank you.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.160
- Your colors
are coordinated.
That is so cute.

12:06.203 --> 12:09.163
- Okay, damn.
Oh, we match.
What the

12:09.206 --> 12:10.294
I'm not taking responsibility
for this look.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.688
- Yes.
I'm corny like that.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.298
Come on, y'all.
Let's go downstairs,
so we can eat.

12:14.342 --> 12:17.737
- Let's go downstairs, y'all.
- We're going to the party!

12:17.780 --> 12:19.390
Stand right here
with grandma real quick.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.697
- I'm gonna hide my drink.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.785
- At this cookout,

12:22.829 --> 12:24.221
I want everybody
to get to know Simon

12:24.265 --> 12:26.702
because I think Simon and I
putting our relationship

12:26.746 --> 12:27.921
into a bubble

12:27.964 --> 12:30.619
has kinda hindered him
meeting my family.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.708
So, this will really
be the first time

12:32.752 --> 12:35.363
all these different
personalities get to know him.

12:35.406 --> 12:36.930
Whatever the hell
question you have,

12:36.973 --> 12:38.105
tell it.
- I agree. All right.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.193
So, I'm gonna pull Simon
for one-on-ones

12:39.236 --> 12:41.499
with all the family tomorrow.

12:41.543 --> 12:42.805
Okay, is this
your 12 o'clock?

12:42.849 --> 12:44.720
- Okay, now.
- All right. Come on in.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.461
This is Simon.
- Speed date Simon.

12:46.504 --> 12:49.203
- Oh, my God, yes!

12:49.246 --> 12:54.425
- But that's the territory,
and I got this.

12:54.469 --> 12:58.081
Oh, this is so cute.
I love that.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.604
Okay, where do we start?
- Plates.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.479
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

13:07.047 --> 13:10.398
- Ooh, look at these ribs.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.573
- Everything looks
so beautiful.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.793
- Girl, scress this week--
Scressed.

13:13.836 --> 13:14.881
- Yeah.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.099
- But everything
turned out amazing,

13:16.143 --> 13:17.231
so that's all
that matters.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.710
- Yeah.

13:18.754 --> 13:21.409
- More gifts-- I love this.
- Yeah, more gifts.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.411
- Did you have your
meeting with Dennis?

13:23.454 --> 13:25.761
- I did. I went--
- And how did that go?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.372
- He was saying, "How could
you let your sister do this?"

13:28.416 --> 13:30.461
I've been in a place
of, like,

13:30.505 --> 13:32.724
having to defend her
since day one.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.770
But at the same time, like,
if you tell her something

13:34.814 --> 13:37.425
that she doesn't agree with,
she's gonna come back at you

13:37.468 --> 13:39.427
and then just not talk
to you anymore.

13:39.470 --> 13:40.907
I'm not afraid to tell her how
I feel,

13:40.950 --> 13:43.213
but I do think she has
a life full of people

13:43.257 --> 13:45.302
that are yes men.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.217
Most of the people
in her life work for her.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.958
It's a little bit hard to keep
your job and tell the truth.

13:50.481 --> 13:51.961
And then, I just told him

13:52.005 --> 13:54.964
I think you should just
go ahead and bring a date.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.839
- You did what?
- What?

13:59.882 --> 14:02.798
She got her fiance
around Pilar.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.365
- You're messy.
You're real messy.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.670
- We'll see.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.370
- I know.
I have a huge family.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.458
- I'm just thinking.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.025
Do you have brothers
like yourself...

14:12.068 --> 14:13.374
or, you know, 'cause we're--

14:13.417 --> 14:15.071
we're trying to get
to know you, Simon,

14:15.115 --> 14:16.812
and you seem like
a perfect guy.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.248
- Thank you.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.728
- Your sibling brothers,
are they anything like you?

14:19.771 --> 14:21.425
- Yeah.
- Or is this night and day?

14:21.469 --> 14:22.600
- I would--
I would say sure.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.385
- And what's your
imperfections?

14:28.215 --> 14:30.826
- My Aunt Darlene
is everything.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.654
She's my mama
only sister, okay?

14:32.697 --> 14:34.612
They were born
in the same year,

14:34.656 --> 14:36.005
so basically
the same person

14:36.049 --> 14:37.180
but not the same person.

14:37.224 --> 14:40.009
Storm is Darlene's
daughter.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.663
She's my first cousin.

14:41.706 --> 14:45.188
She's mini-Porsha,
but she is all of Storm, okay?

14:45.232 --> 14:48.670
When Storm enters the room,
you will know about it.

14:48.713 --> 14:52.848
Miss Esther is my mother's
very good friend,

14:52.892 --> 14:55.198
and your business
is her business,

14:55.242 --> 14:57.374
and that's just
how it goes.

14:57.418 --> 15:00.160
- Simon, what's so different
about our Porsha?

15:00.203 --> 15:02.336
I know this isn't going
to be your first marriage,

15:02.379 --> 15:03.598
and-and it's not yours.

15:03.641 --> 15:04.991
So, I really have
the same question for you.

15:05.034 --> 15:08.168
- His is three times over.
I'm fourth marriage.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.169
- Wow.
- Really?

15:09.212 --> 15:10.822
- Yes. Yes.
- For real?

15:10.866 --> 15:12.041
- Oh, my Lord.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.179
- Awkward--
it's so awkward.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.571
It is.
I'm not gonna lie.

15:22.399 --> 15:23.705
- Fourth wife?

15:23.748 --> 15:25.011
- Honey, you're running
through 'em

15:25.054 --> 15:27.404
like you pourin' water
out the back door.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.062
- One common denominator
that came out of

15:33.106 --> 15:35.673
all those relationships--

15:35.717 --> 15:37.110
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.939
- Uh, was that I found out
that I-- I'm a rescuer.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.723
- You was a rescuer.

15:41.766 --> 15:44.856
- But, well, what I found out
after at least 100 hours

15:44.900 --> 15:47.729
of therapy, is that
that's not my job.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.383
- You can't change--
that's right.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.385
It's not your job.
- That's right.

15:51.428 --> 15:54.954
- What's up, y'all?
What's up? What's up?

15:54.997 --> 15:58.044
- Baby!

15:58.087 --> 15:59.523
- What's up?

15:59.567 --> 16:01.090
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.878
- Hey, baby.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.141
- What's up, D?
- Oh, wee.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.707
- Oh. What's up, cuz?

16:09.751 --> 16:10.882
What's up?
How y'all doin'?

16:10.926 --> 16:12.362
What's up, my brother?
- Hey.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.711
- How ya doin', man? You good?
- What's up, brother?

16:13.755 --> 16:14.886
Oh, I am stuck
in this damn thing.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.540
- You good?
Come on. We got it.

16:16.584 --> 16:17.933
There we go.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.500
- How you doin', brother?
- You good?

16:19.543 --> 16:20.631
How you doing, my brother?
- Yeah, good to see you, man.

16:20.675 --> 16:21.850
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, mom. How are you?

16:21.893 --> 16:23.025
- Hi. How are you?
- Good. How you doin'?

16:23.069 --> 16:25.027
- Good to see you, as well.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.811
- What's up?
Bring it in. Bring it in.

16:26.855 --> 16:27.943
- You came. You came.
- Okay, okay.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.163
- Okay.
- You listened to me.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.729
- How you doin'?
- Good. And you?

16:31.773 --> 16:34.123
Hi, grandma.
- Aww.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.169
- What's up, ma?
How you doin'?

16:36.212 --> 16:40.651
- Dennis made a very active
effort to really get to know

16:40.695 --> 16:42.305
all of Porsha's family
up front,

16:42.349 --> 16:46.918
but Dennis did do some
really messed up things.

16:46.962 --> 16:50.835
So, everyone is optimistic

16:50.879 --> 16:53.577
that she will be happy
with Simon.

16:53.621 --> 16:56.015
- Dennis, I thought
we was gonna meet your
new girlfriend today.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.233
- What you talkin' about?
- Esther.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.757
- I ain't got no girlfriend.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.194
I don't.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.630
- He got a piece.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.068
- I came with
the best date.

17:06.112 --> 17:09.289
PJ always gonna be my first
choice for a date

17:09.332 --> 17:10.986
at any event
she can get into.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.379
- So, I have a--
I have a question.

17:12.422 --> 17:14.598
Simon, where are you from?
- Nigeria.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.687
- His people are Benin.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.689
- And his mother
is half--

17:18.733 --> 17:20.082
- Urhobo.
- Urhobo.

17:20.126 --> 17:22.215
- I've seen Porsha with
different boyfriends,

17:22.258 --> 17:25.261
fiances,
you know, husbands, whatever,

17:25.305 --> 17:27.046
but it just seem like
when we were out,

17:27.089 --> 17:29.570
I've never seen her
interact with someone

17:29.613 --> 17:31.615
in that way, and it just
seemed like y'all were just,

17:31.659 --> 17:33.878
like, had this, like, little,
like, vibe and connection.

17:33.922 --> 17:36.098
It was real cool.
- Oh, thank you.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.665
- This can't be fun
for Dennis.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.014
- You all have a union

17:39.058 --> 17:40.711
even though you haven't
made it to the altar.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.539
- Simon's like a new toy.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.106
They're like, ooh,
let's play with the new toy.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.977
Like, oh, what do you do?
Where'd you come from?

17:46.021 --> 17:47.240
Like, Dennis
is like the old toy

17:47.283 --> 17:50.678
in the basket over here.
So, it's just awkward.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.115
- Where did Mama Gina go?

17:53.159 --> 17:57.119
- In all my years
of having co-parents,

17:57.163 --> 17:59.121
this is the best
situation ever

17:59.165 --> 18:01.863
because I came in,
right off the bat,

18:01.906 --> 18:03.125
with that man
right there.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.474
- Cheers.
- Mr. Dennis.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.259
- Dennis!

18:06.302 --> 18:09.131
- Yes.
- You was a real man.

18:09.175 --> 18:12.308
Dennis a real man.
That's what real mens do.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.788
We're family,
one big family

18:13.831 --> 18:16.269
'cause we have a beautiful
granddaughter right there.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.009
- Any man who try to
mess with her,

18:18.053 --> 18:19.141
I'll take him down

18:19.185 --> 18:20.577
just like what the daddy
would want me to.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.582
- But we're not
sharing wives now.

18:25.626 --> 18:26.801
We only sharing the baby.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.634
I cherish family,
and I love family.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.070
- We love you, grandma.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.681
- Oh, my God,
y'all all some crybabies.

18:37.725 --> 18:38.595
- What's going on?

18:38.639 --> 18:40.031
- What you so emotional about?

18:40.075 --> 18:42.643
- No, it's--
it's happy tears.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.862
You know how women get in a
relationship, and they say,

18:44.906 --> 18:46.429
"Well, I love him,
and I love him."

18:46.473 --> 18:48.127
Well, I do.
I love Dennis,

18:48.170 --> 18:50.651
and I love what I'm seeing
and what I'm hearing,

18:50.694 --> 18:53.436
and the family life
that Simon want to have

18:53.480 --> 18:55.046
for my daughter.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.091
We're gon' be family,

18:56.135 --> 18:57.484
but it wasn't gon' be
the family

18:57.527 --> 18:59.834
that we had set it up to be.
- Started out, yeah.

18:59.877 --> 19:03.316
- And so, it just seem like
since that part didn't work out,

19:03.359 --> 19:05.970
that's just busting
the whole thing up.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.450
- If I can just
say something...

19:07.494 --> 19:09.191
- Say it, girl.
- Hold on. Hold on.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.540
Hold-hold-- hold on.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.329
Man, like,
are we at a repass?

19:16.372 --> 19:18.069
Like, what's going on?

19:18.113 --> 19:20.724
A lot of crying,
a lot of emotions--

19:20.768 --> 19:23.205
I just thought
we was eating barbecue
for Porsha's birthday.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.512
- This is a happy moment
and a bittersweet one.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.774
- I'm glad I didn't
bring a date

19:26.817 --> 19:28.297
because she would've
definitely been like,

19:28.341 --> 19:31.213
yo, this is weird.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.910
- We're a good family.
- That's right.

19:32.954 --> 19:36.305
- Although, I must also say
and speak from my heart.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.220
Transitions are always hard,

19:38.264 --> 19:41.615
and we don't want PJ
to recognize a separation.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.007
- That's right. That's right.
- No.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.619
- And I think we can put aside
some of our issues

19:45.662 --> 19:48.839
and stay focused on the person
that's most important.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.233
- That's well said.
- Yes.

19:51.277 --> 19:55.629
- But I don't see why any of us
should have a issue

19:55.672 --> 20:00.764
because I understand
Dennis life that he lead

20:00.808 --> 20:05.682
because I had a son
lived the very same life.

20:05.726 --> 20:06.944
They like ladies.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.119
- But he's-- he's--

20:08.163 --> 20:10.600
You know what?
All men love ladies.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.776
- Oh, no, but I didn't--
I-- no, no, no, now.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.082
- Okay.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.605
- Please don't try to
take this the wrong way.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.433
I-- I'll try to explain
to make it sweet.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.130
- Watch your drink, mommy.
Don't knock that over.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.523
Ut-oh.
She's gettin' up, y'all.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.917
- I got to get up
and come closer to y'all.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.659
- Now, you just let her say
what she wanna say.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.791
- I don't think y'all
quite understand.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.663
- Yeah, grandma, we're good.
- I'm not putting anybody down.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.447
- I know.
- You're entitled to your life

20:31.491 --> 20:32.927
and live the way
you want it to.

20:32.970 --> 20:34.276
- Yes, ma'am.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.452
- And how we wanted it to go
for you and Porsha,

20:36.496 --> 20:39.325
it maybe wasn't what you
and her wanted at the time.

20:39.368 --> 20:42.023
So, now it may be too late.
I guess it too late.

20:42.066 --> 20:45.069
- Uh, I think it too late.
- But I'm just sayin', Gina.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.289
- Oh, Lord.
- All mens is men.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.291
I had a son,
and he was a playboy.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.379
- Okay.
- All right.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.294
- Well, he's not
a playboy, though.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.687
- Oh, well, he love--
- To what extent?

20:53.730 --> 20:55.602
To what extent?
- What's going on here?

20:55.645 --> 20:57.299
Hey, cuz! What's up, cuz?
- To what extent?

20:57.343 --> 20:59.649
People-- people live and learn,
and when they live and learn,

20:59.693 --> 21:00.781
things change.
- Okay. Now, look, let's--

21:00.824 --> 21:02.304
- No, no, no.
All men are like that.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.349
- And, you know.
- I know. I know, grandma.

21:03.392 --> 21:04.437
- And you know--
and you know what?

21:04.480 --> 21:05.699
Another thing I wanna say,

21:05.742 --> 21:08.571
eventually, he is gonna
meet someone

21:08.615 --> 21:11.531
who is gonna make him
just as happy.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.924
Grandma Iona
was out of line.

21:13.968 --> 21:16.753
Simon is still
a married man.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.887
His situation is worse,
to me, than cheating.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.498
He's cheating in the eyes
of the Lord. Amen.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.632
- Can I make a toast?
- Yeah. Go ahead on.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.374
Go ahead.
I always will love you.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.071
- Thank you.
- I'm ready.

21:30.114 --> 21:32.247
- In all seriousness,
there's nothin' but love here,

21:32.291 --> 21:33.683
and I'm really happy
for y'all,

21:33.727 --> 21:36.120
and I know when Porsha loves,
she loves super hard.

21:36.164 --> 21:37.644
- Hard. All right.
- Right?

21:37.687 --> 21:40.429
So, I'm happy for y'all.
And no more tears, man.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.475
This is a celebration.
This is your birthday.

21:42.518 --> 21:45.042
Uh, cheers to-- to Simon
and Porsha. Cheers.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.827
- Amen.
- Porsha!

21:46.870 --> 21:48.959
- Cheers!

21:52.093 --> 21:53.703
- Coming up next...

21:53.747 --> 21:56.053
- Clearly, we have a big-ass
misunderstanding right now.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.185
- You need to apologize
for that

21:57.228 --> 21:59.100
'cause I've never
used profanity.

21:59.143 --> 22:01.276
- My apologies to you.
- Okay. Oh, I'm gettin'
an apology.

22:07.413 --> 22:10.154
- Gary, you are not right,
but here's my thing.

22:10.198 --> 22:12.374
I feel like even though
if someone was

22:12.418 --> 22:13.593
in an insane asylum,

22:13.636 --> 22:15.595
you can't stop 'em
from getting pregnant.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.727
That's impossible.

22:20.077 --> 22:22.558
- I've been encouraging
the women in our family

22:22.602 --> 22:25.256
to come together
and go on a trip.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.873
- Okay, awesome.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.396
I love you.
Talk to you soon.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.615
- Love you, too.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.751
- Cheers.
- Mm-hmm.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.797
- I know you've been
getting a lot of backlash.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.538
How was her family?
How are they accepting you?

22:45.581 --> 22:47.017
- I think they like me.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.845
Probably a breath
of fresh air.

22:55.199 --> 22:57.463

- I ain't trying
to give nothin'.

22:59.073 --> 23:00.683
What does giving
nothing look like?

23:00.727 --> 23:02.598

You can give mom.

- And then I have this one.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.271
- Yeah, you give
boob or leg, right?

23:23.314 --> 23:24.446
- Yeah.

23:31.192 --> 23:35.414
- I mean, I haven't been
out alone with Dennis

23:35.457 --> 23:36.937

I wanna make sure I'm
not giving any signals

23:41.811 --> 23:42.986
of anything.
- Right.

23:43.030 --> 23:44.553
You want your signals
not to be mixed.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.947
Now, this gives pregnant
sometimes when you wear it.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.514
- No, come on.
- He just found you're engaged.

23:48.557 --> 23:50.341
Let's not make the man
think you're pregnant.

23:50.385 --> 23:53.475

that he bought the whole line.

- I just think it gives
hiding pregnancy sometimes.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.392
- Or he's giving
hiding my curves.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.785
- He's trying to hide.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.047
Oh, that's what it is.
- Trying to hide all this.

24:00.090 --> 24:01.091
- He's trying to
hide your waist.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.353

25:10.204 --> 25:12.119
Would you like to start

25:12.162 --> 25:13.381

I'll start there.

No pleasantries.

I'm doing fine.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.973
- I was talking to
your mama the other day.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.278
She said you was
looking for houses.

25:42.932 --> 25:45.195
- Let me?

25:45.239 --> 25:47.894
You have been supportive
of our relationship.

25:47.937 --> 25:49.069
- I'm publicly supportive

25:49.112 --> 25:50.461
because that's
the right thing to do

25:50.505 --> 25:52.333
because I want you to be happy.
- Oh, publicly.

25:55.336 --> 25:59.296
- Privately, you know, uh,
uh, sh--, it look crazy.

25:59.340 --> 26:00.776
- How?

26:00.820 --> 26:04.084
- You're going on this
spiritual journey of healing.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.520
You redefine yourself
to a point

26:05.564 --> 26:07.087
where you're ready
to get engaged again.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.611
- I understand your questions.

26:09.655 --> 26:10.917
- If you break your arm,
you can't even heal

26:10.960 --> 26:12.266
your sh-- in 120 days.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.094
- You don't know
how my bones heal.

26:14.137 --> 26:15.661
- We just broke up,
really, in January.

26:15.704 --> 26:16.879
- No, no, no, Dennis.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.315
No, no, no.
- Give anybody the energy--

26:18.359 --> 26:19.621
- Hold on, no, no, no.
We did not break up January.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.275
- You told me you was--
- After Christmas--

26:21.318 --> 26:22.363
- Yes.

26:22.406 --> 26:23.930
- That's when
we were over, over.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.453
We were done, done.

26:25.496 --> 26:26.628
That was it, it.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.848
Thank you.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.153
- Let me get one of them, too.
- Okay.

26:30.197 --> 26:31.198
- Dennis and I have been
going back and forth,

26:31.241 --> 26:32.460
going back and forth.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.027
When we got to
Christmas, I said,

26:34.070 --> 26:35.942
"If you bring
a ring back on Christmas,

26:35.985 --> 26:37.291
I'm gonna put
the ring back on,

26:37.334 --> 26:39.075
and we're gonna work
on this for real."

26:39.119 --> 26:41.121
Christmas came.
I said, "Where is the ring?"

26:41.164 --> 26:43.906
He said,
"Oh, I didn't bring it."

26:43.950 --> 26:46.953
And I said to myself,
"You be complete.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.563
Then you can be better
for your daughter.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.956
You don't have
to be with her father

26:49.999 --> 26:51.261
to be better for her,"

26:51.305 --> 26:53.133
because all that
back and forth with him,

26:53.176 --> 26:55.744
honestly, wasn't
really good for her.

26:55.788 --> 26:58.007
It wasn't.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.922
- But I know you, bro.
I know you.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.794
I know you, I know you.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.143
I know you.
- And we would still

27:03.186 --> 27:06.712
have been together
if you did not cheat.

27:08.017 --> 27:09.671
It ain't like I just
woke up and was like,

27:09.715 --> 27:10.803
oh, I don't want my family.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.152
Get the out.
No.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.110
- You're still mad
about that?

27:15.721 --> 27:17.026
- To be disrespected

27:17.070 --> 27:19.333
at the most sacred time
in your life, it's like,

27:19.376 --> 27:20.943
I just can't forgive that.
- Yeah.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.293
- He was unfaithful to me

27:23.337 --> 27:24.991
while I was carrying
our child.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.557
It did give me insecurity.

27:26.601 --> 27:27.994
You think I wanna be
with somebody,

27:28.037 --> 27:30.039
as I'm getting older,
and fluffy,

27:30.083 --> 27:32.346
and whatever else
that come with my age,

27:32.389 --> 27:34.740
I wanna think you have
been attracted to somebody

27:34.783 --> 27:36.176
so much younger than me?

27:36.219 --> 27:37.481
Even if I did
get over the cheating,

27:37.525 --> 27:39.396
that long-lasting insecurity
was still there

27:39.440 --> 27:41.094
'cause you're still
in that world.

27:41.137 --> 27:44.184
You still work around
these same people.

27:44.227 --> 27:47.187
Simon treats me
like a queen,

27:47.230 --> 27:50.973
and that has nothing to do
with spending money.

27:51.017 --> 27:54.716
Simon respects my mind.
He listens to me.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.326
He wanted me to be
his wife.

27:56.370 --> 27:58.459
He's making it happen.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.113
You sound like
you're emotional

28:00.156 --> 28:01.418
about this situation.
- I-- maybe I am.

28:01.462 --> 28:02.855
- Way more emotional
than you say to me.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.117
- Maybe I am a little emotional.
- I did not even know

28:04.160 --> 28:05.596
you felt like this.

28:08.643 --> 28:11.385
Lauren was telling me
that you said to her

28:11.428 --> 28:13.387
that you think I'm still
in love wit' you.

28:13.430 --> 28:15.389
- I say you still love me,
and you do,

28:17.652 --> 28:19.480
and I still love you.
- In what way?

28:20.916 --> 28:22.701
- We love each other.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.622
- I say you still love me,
and you do,

28:33.842 --> 28:36.671
and I still love you.
- In what way?

28:36.715 --> 28:39.195
- We love each other, stop it.
- Like a love-love?

28:39.239 --> 28:40.849
Like a muah-muah

28:40.893 --> 28:42.590
or like a family
co-parents in love?
- Porsha, stop it, bro.

28:42.633 --> 28:43.896
Whatever you wanna
call it, bro.

28:43.939 --> 28:46.550
- Oh, my God, you know what?

28:46.594 --> 28:48.639
I realize
this isn't a dinner

28:48.683 --> 28:50.250
with my co-parent.

28:50.293 --> 28:53.122
This is a dinner
with my ex.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.734
The ex has entered the chat.

28:55.777 --> 28:58.649
We have unearthed
how you really feel.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.782
You ain't ready to be
coming to a cookout.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.305
- If I come around,
I'm bringing somethin', too.

29:02.349 --> 29:05.134
- You don't even talk
about women like they're women.

29:05.178 --> 29:06.135
Bringing somethin' to it.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.485
Bringing a piece.
Bring some work.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.574
What are these works
and pieces' names?

29:17.190 --> 29:20.062
- We don't gotta go
back and forth on this.

29:20.106 --> 29:21.585
I still got some sh--
at your house, too, I need.

29:21.629 --> 29:22.804
I want my Fendi sh--.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.807
Where my Versace robe at?

29:25.851 --> 29:28.897
Shoot, that ain't yours.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.377
- Excuse me.
- Thank you so much.

29:30.420 --> 29:31.900
- Oh, my pleasure.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.824
- Ready to go?

29:42.868 --> 29:44.347
This is definitely
a setback

29:44.391 --> 29:48.177
because when I say that
I wanna blend my family,

29:48.221 --> 29:50.484
I'm talking about
Dennis and Mama Gina.

29:50.527 --> 29:53.269
So, I have a lot
more work to do

29:53.313 --> 29:54.923
than I thought I did.

30:01.974 --> 30:02.888
- They're fittin'
to pull it up.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.672
Where yours?

30:04.715 --> 30:06.892
- I Ubered.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.458
Huh?
- Who is that?

30:08.502 --> 30:10.504
- What?
- Oh, you're so lame.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.940
- What?
- You gonna try to pull

30:11.984 --> 30:13.202
somebody's naked picture up
while I'm standing here.

30:13.246 --> 30:14.421
- I didn't.
That was not a naked picture.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.162
- You are so lame.
- I gotta check my sh--.

30:20.601 --> 30:21.863
Yo, I'm going
to Republic, man.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.082
You think I could get
a hookup with a table?

30:23.125 --> 30:24.910
- Oh, no, look like
you got some work for you

30:24.953 --> 30:26.868
later on in your phone.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.000
Thank you so much.

30:28.043 --> 30:28.827
- All right.
You have a good day, man.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.393
- No, you have a good day.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.616
- Hey love.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.923
- Hey, what are you doing?

30:37.966 --> 30:41.056
- Sitting here in bed
about ready to watch a movie.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.057
I miss you.

30:42.101 --> 30:43.929
- Aww, I miss you,
too, babes.

30:43.972 --> 30:46.714
I just left from dinner
with Dennis.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.761
- He's just like,
"You know what?

30:50.805 --> 30:53.155
I'm trying,
but you're doing a lot."

30:57.159 --> 30:59.901
- I really didn't realize
there was so much

30:59.945 --> 31:01.990
more healing that
needed to happen.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.905
I don't necessarily
feel like Dennis

31:03.949 --> 31:05.951
is in love with me.

31:05.994 --> 31:08.388
Yes, he loves me.
Yes, I love him.

31:08.431 --> 31:11.521
I have a relationship
with him as a co-parent

31:11.565 --> 31:13.175
and being in love
with Dennis

31:13.219 --> 31:15.177
would mean
I wanna sext Dennis.

31:15.221 --> 31:17.049
If I wanted to be with Dennis,
I would be with Dennis.

31:19.007 --> 31:20.226
It's just not
that confusing.

31:20.269 --> 31:22.881
I think with me
not wanting him

31:22.924 --> 31:25.318
to bring somebody
to my party

31:25.361 --> 31:27.494
probably still could've
been a part of me

31:27.537 --> 31:29.888
not really ready
for all that yet.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.151
- Yeah.

31:35.632 --> 31:36.938
- It's gonna take
a little more work.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.505
Take a little more time.

31:38.548 --> 31:40.246
It'll take
some more patience.

31:40.289 --> 31:42.683
I love you.
- I love you, too, baby.

31:54.782 --> 31:56.740
- Hi.
- Hi, you look so pretty.

31:56.784 --> 31:59.743
- So do you, gorgeous.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.571
- Well, thank you
for having us.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.225
I've missed our circles.

32:03.269 --> 32:05.401
- I know.
It's been a little while.

32:05.445 --> 32:06.881
- Take my shoes off.
My feet look crazy.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.057
- Yes, let's get grounded.
- Yes.

32:09.101 --> 32:11.842
So, I wanna take my whole
family on a retreat.

32:11.886 --> 32:14.019
This past year,
we've all been thinking

32:14.062 --> 32:15.324
about our lives differently.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.587
So, we decided that
it might be a good idea

32:17.631 --> 32:19.415
to go do
a spiritual retreat.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.069
- Yeah.
- Girls trip!

32:21.113 --> 32:24.246
- Mama Gina, we would love
for you to come, as well.

32:24.290 --> 32:27.597
I think, to me, it's about
just the women of this family

32:27.641 --> 32:30.470
being able to deal
with our stuff.

32:30.513 --> 32:33.647
- Hopefully, this will
have them appreciate me

32:33.690 --> 32:35.040
as a healer.
- Yeah.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.606
- 'Cause I think they
just see me as old Lauren.

32:36.650 --> 32:37.912
- Right.
- And I've changed so much.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.001
- Hello.
- Hi.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.829
- Hello.
- Welcome, welcome.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.701
- Aunt Liz and I have
a special connection.

32:44.745 --> 32:47.139
Aunt Liz is my dad's sister,
and she's the first person

32:47.182 --> 32:49.184
to introduce me
to meditation.

32:49.228 --> 32:52.579
And we have the same heart.
We both want to help people.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.363
I love Aunt Liz.

32:54.407 --> 32:57.062
She has also been
studying to be a shaman.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.672
- For about three years,

32:58.715 --> 33:00.413
yeah.
- Oh, amazing.

33:01.805 --> 33:02.893
- Hi.

33:02.937 --> 33:05.026
Oh, my gosh.
- Welcome to the oasis.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.419
- Thank you for coming.

33:06.462 --> 33:07.724
Hi, muah.
- Muah.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.030
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm Lena.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.162
- Are you--?
You hug, okay.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.337
- Welcome hug, yes.
- Okay.

33:11.380 --> 33:12.642
- Welcome, welcome.

33:12.686 --> 33:13.992
- Ooh.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.123
- Ooh, you got
the fancy glasses.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.038
- Spiritual king--
spiritual prince.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.866
- You got it.
I'm the African King.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.045
- Yeah, so, I'm a shaman,
medicine woman.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.046
- Shaman.
- Sha--

33:25.090 --> 33:27.309
- Psychotherapist.
- Yeah.

33:27.353 --> 33:29.137
- Before we go into
our practice,

33:29.181 --> 33:32.488
it's so important
to set our intention.

33:32.532 --> 33:35.404
So, what is your intention,
right now, in your life?

33:35.448 --> 33:37.885
- My intention is
to do as much as I can

33:37.928 --> 33:40.540
to lift the consciousness
in this life.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.063
- It's time for me
to start realizing people

33:42.107 --> 33:43.456
just are who they are,

33:43.499 --> 33:44.892
not who I want them to be.
- Yeah, that's right.

33:44.935 --> 33:47.460
- I still have an intention
to communicate

33:47.503 --> 33:49.070
what I'm learning.

33:49.114 --> 33:52.813
- My intention is to

33:52.856 --> 33:55.859
move with
love and patience

33:55.903 --> 33:58.384
for a lotta different people.
- Yeah.

33:58.427 --> 34:02.040
- My family unit
that Dennis and I had,

34:02.083 --> 34:05.304
you know, it was for PJ.

34:05.347 --> 34:07.871
So, I'm still trying
to keep that,

34:07.915 --> 34:10.048
what I've envisioned,
together for her.

34:10.091 --> 34:12.833
- You have such a powerful,
beautiful heart.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.182
- Thank you.

34:14.226 --> 34:15.792
- You're like a walking
heart chakra.

34:17.359 --> 34:20.449
So, when we use drumming
for breathwork,

34:20.493 --> 34:23.583
we're also calling in
our ancestors.

34:23.626 --> 34:24.975
- Mmm.
- Because...

34:25.019 --> 34:27.108
ooh, I feel some energy.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.892
- That was powerful.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.851
- I-- this room is
gettin' crowded.

34:30.894 --> 34:33.114
- Yeah, I got goosebumps.

34:33.158 --> 34:34.550
- I see your goosebumps.

34:34.594 --> 34:38.119
- Yeah, when she said,
"Calling in the ancestors"--

34:38.163 --> 34:40.208
Who they callin' in?

34:40.252 --> 34:42.906
- It's inhale.
Inhale through the nostrils.

34:42.950 --> 34:45.518
Exhale through the mouth.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.654
- Lena probably
doesn't know very much

34:51.698 --> 34:53.787
about Black people at all.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.181
We don't call in
familiar spirits

34:56.224 --> 34:59.053
because we believe
in demons.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.099
- Release trauma.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.970
Release abuse.

35:03.013 --> 35:05.146
Release silencing.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.018
- Ooh, I'm gettin' high.
- Three.

35:09.281 --> 35:10.238
Two.

35:11.370 --> 35:12.414
One.

35:14.460 --> 35:17.158
♪ Holy spirit

35:17.202 --> 35:21.510
♪ you are welcome
in this place ♪

35:21.554 --> 35:23.164

she can handle

35:23.208 --> 35:24.905
the work that she's doing,

35:24.948 --> 35:28.343

the safety of everybody.

35:46.579 --> 35:48.494
and when I did,
everything lifted.

35:50.104 --> 35:53.455
- Aho, amen.

35:53.499 --> 35:55.588
- So, that brings me
to the retreat.

35:55.631 --> 35:57.111
Everyone has been invited,

35:57.155 --> 35:59.461
but are we still
inviting Mama Gina

35:59.505 --> 36:02.072
after what happened
at the cookout?

36:02.116 --> 36:03.465
- I know.
- Mm-hmm.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.032
- I don't want her to feel
like she's the only one,

36:05.075 --> 36:07.165
like, fighting
on Dennis' side.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.818
- I think the trip
would actually be

36:08.862 --> 36:10.255
more beneficial for her

36:10.298 --> 36:11.821
than some of
the rest of us.

36:11.865 --> 36:14.215
- I need to think about this.
Can I pray about it?

36:14.259 --> 36:15.782
And then I'll let
you know

36:15.825 --> 36:17.175
whether I'm still
okay with it.

36:17.218 --> 36:19.002

36:24.182 --> 36:27.054

that Dennis was a cheater,

36:27.097 --> 36:28.142
you get upset.
- Okay,

- Hey, you.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.602
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm good.

36:53.646 --> 36:54.864
You look beautiful.
- Good, good.

36:54.908 --> 36:56.214
Thank you.
So do you, as always.

36:56.257 --> 36:57.519
- Look at you.

36:57.563 --> 36:59.304
Did you notice this shirt?

36:59.347 --> 37:00.566
- Uh-huh.
That's pretty.

37:00.609 --> 37:01.828
- This is the one
you bought me.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.351
- Yes, Mother's Day.
- Was it Mother's Day?

37:03.395 --> 37:04.918
- Mother's Day, yeah.
- Yeah, Mother's Day last year.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.833
Well, I'm glad you
could come out today.

37:06.876 --> 37:08.051
- Yeah.
- Hey, how is it going?

37:08.095 --> 37:09.052
- Doing good.
- Have you figured out

37:09.096 --> 37:10.271
what you'd like
to do for lunch?

37:10.315 --> 37:11.403
- Yeah, I'm gonna
start with the mussels.

37:11.446 --> 37:12.839
- Barbecue wings.

37:12.882 --> 37:15.668
- Now, she's allergic
to garlic, so extra garlic.

37:15.711 --> 37:17.147
I'm just playing.

37:17.191 --> 37:18.236
- I'll make sure to let
the kitchen know.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.280
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.934
- Do I care about
Mama Gina?

37:20.977 --> 37:23.545
Hell yes, but, of course,
I understand

37:23.589 --> 37:26.896
that she feels like a bit
of an outsider right now,

37:26.940 --> 37:28.420
but I wanna make
her understand

37:28.463 --> 37:30.378
you're still a priority
in Pilar's life.

37:30.422 --> 37:31.727
So, what's been up
wit' you?

37:31.771 --> 37:33.251
- Work, work, work.

37:33.294 --> 37:34.730
- And PJ.
- And PJ.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.123
- She's just
growing up so much.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.690
I went into the room
this morning,

37:37.733 --> 37:40.083
and, um, mommy was
giving her some juice,

37:40.127 --> 37:44.000
and she said,
"Well, hello, cheers."

37:46.089 --> 37:48.527
And mommy said she got it
from at the cookout.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.311
- Yeah, you'd be
surprised what they see.

37:50.355 --> 37:51.530
- Yeah.

37:51.573 --> 37:52.661
- Yeah.
- Well, she's smart.

37:52.705 --> 37:55.055
You know, she definitely
picking up on

37:55.098 --> 37:57.710
she goes to daddy's house
and mommy's house.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.277
That's why I liked
when we were able

37:59.320 --> 38:00.843
to spend time together

38:00.887 --> 38:01.975
so that she gets see that, too.
- So, how you feel about

38:02.018 --> 38:03.716
the from daddy house
to mommy house?

38:03.759 --> 38:05.761
I know that was
a small issue for you

38:05.805 --> 38:07.415
when you were coming up?

38:07.459 --> 38:10.113
- When I was younger,
I saw my mom

38:10.157 --> 38:12.420
being able to be
around my stepmom,

38:12.464 --> 38:15.554
and my grandmother
and her husband

38:15.597 --> 38:17.382
being able to be around
my mother's father.

38:17.425 --> 38:18.470
- Oh, okay.

38:18.513 --> 38:20.210
Oh, my.
- Oh, that looks good.

38:20.254 --> 38:21.560
- Got our mussels.

38:21.603 --> 38:24.171
- Yes, thank you.
- My pleasure.

38:24.214 --> 38:25.738
And our barbecue wings.
- Oh, it's got cream sauce.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.696
So, I--
- Speaking of grandma,

38:27.740 --> 38:29.002
if I can change the subject,

38:29.045 --> 38:31.570
what brought all that on
with her at the cookout?

38:31.613 --> 38:33.006
- Everybody was
being emotional.

38:33.049 --> 38:34.573
I think she was like,
well, you know what?

38:34.616 --> 38:36.618
Hold on now.
Let's not be this sad

38:36.662 --> 38:39.926
and forget why these
two people are broken up,

38:39.969 --> 38:41.797
and then you, you know,

38:41.841 --> 38:43.756
then it got offended.
- Yeah, but it-it-it--

38:43.799 --> 38:45.714
- I had a son,
and he was a playboy.

38:45.758 --> 38:46.976
- Okay.
- Hey.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.675
- But he's not
a playboy, though.

38:49.718 --> 38:52.199
Was it brought up
to embarrass him?

38:53.983 --> 38:56.203
- That situation was
embarrassing for me, too.

38:56.246 --> 38:57.770
- Well, I'm pretty sure
there was some situations

38:57.813 --> 38:58.901
in the relationship
that probably

38:58.945 --> 39:01.730
was embarrassing
to him, too.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.036
- Yeah, but we're not
talking about that.

39:03.079 --> 39:04.254
We're talking about--
- Well, but-but-but if--

39:04.298 --> 39:05.865
- We can never talk
about what Dennis--

39:05.908 --> 39:08.128
- What's good for the goose,
is good for the gander, right?

39:08.171 --> 39:09.390
- You deflect.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.871
That means we're not
acknowledging the truth.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.309
- Right.
- Right.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.137
- Can we acknowledge
the truth?

39:17.180 --> 39:19.269
- Clearly, we have a big-ass
misunderstanding right now.

39:19.313 --> 39:21.141
So, I--
- Please don't use
that language.

39:21.184 --> 39:22.490
- I won't, I won't.
So, anyway--

39:22.534 --> 39:23.883
- I just want us to be
respectful to each other.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.319
- You have cursed
around me before.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.799
I have cursed around you.
- I-I don't use profanity.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.540
- Okay, we're brand-new.
So, okay.

39:28.583 --> 39:29.715
- You need to
apologize for that

39:29.758 --> 39:33.109
'cause I've never
used profanity.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.460
- Okay, so, my apology.
- Okay, so, you wanna apologize?

39:35.503 --> 39:37.810
- My apologies to you.
- Okay, oh, I get an apology.

39:39.028 --> 39:41.161
- How?
I don't understand

39:41.204 --> 39:43.555
what would cause her
to have this type of,

39:43.598 --> 39:47.254
like, built up energy
against me.

39:47.297 --> 39:48.995
I'm just with open arms,

39:49.038 --> 39:50.823
and my open arms
are being met with,

39:50.866 --> 39:52.346
like, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.695
Okay, so--
- Be honest, be honest with me.

39:53.739 --> 39:56.002
- You won't even let me
talk to get it out.

39:56.045 --> 39:58.570
- Okay, I'm listening.
- Okay.

39:58.613 --> 40:00.267
When my grandmother
is speaking,

40:00.310 --> 40:01.573
that's her truth.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.226
You happen not
to have liked it.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.838
However, I will ask you,
in the future,

40:05.881 --> 40:07.796
to not change your tone
with my grandmother.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.146
You were getting a little
disrespectful with her.

40:10.190 --> 40:11.844
- Yeah, 'cause she was
rude and disrespectful

40:11.887 --> 40:12.801
to my son.
- No, not-- hold on, wait.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.890
Hold on.
Not, "Yeah, 'cause."

40:14.934 --> 40:16.239
That's my grandmother.

40:16.283 --> 40:18.416
- It wasn't a matter
of disrespect.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.766
- Everyone at the table
is trying to be honest.

40:20.809 --> 40:24.030
When someone mentions
that Dennis was a cheater,

40:24.073 --> 40:25.074
you get upset.
- Okay,

40:25.118 --> 40:26.902
but you were
a cheater, too.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.602
- No, I did not
cheat on him.

40:30.645 --> 40:32.168
- Oh, that wasn't
what I heard.

40:32.212 --> 40:34.040
- Well, you're--
- According to a certain person.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.781
- A certain person who?
- Your mom.

40:37.609 --> 40:39.349
- My mom never said
I cheated on him.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.308
- I know what conversation
I had wit' your mom.

40:41.351 --> 40:43.353
March of 2020,

40:43.397 --> 40:45.878
when Dennis and Porsha

40:45.921 --> 40:47.880
were kinda on the outs,

40:47.923 --> 40:49.708
Diane and I had
some conversation,

40:49.751 --> 40:52.972
and, you know,
she just simply referred to

40:53.015 --> 40:56.323
it's probably due to
the relationship

40:56.366 --> 40:58.804
that Porsha had
with this gentleman

40:58.847 --> 41:01.067
that probably upset Dennis.

41:01.110 --> 41:02.721
You know, I just
let her talk,

41:02.764 --> 41:04.462
and I held it
in my back pocket

41:04.505 --> 41:06.899
'til the correct moment.

41:06.942 --> 41:08.161
Look, I know what
your mom told me.

41:08.204 --> 41:09.684
- But I am here to tell you
that these are--

41:09.728 --> 41:11.077
- Go back and have that
conversation with your mother.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.731
- My mom would have never
told you I cheated on him

41:12.774 --> 41:14.254
'cause I never did that.
- Okay.

41:14.297 --> 41:16.735
- This is someone who
I've always respected,

41:16.778 --> 41:19.912
and now you're gonna
blatantly lie

41:19.955 --> 41:22.305
on me and on my mom.

41:22.349 --> 41:23.611
Come on, now.

41:23.655 --> 41:26.788
So, let me bring it
back down to the middle

41:26.832 --> 41:30.444
and remember why I'm here.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.316
For us to move forward
in this new family

41:33.360 --> 41:35.405
since we don't have
to be together,

41:35.449 --> 41:37.886
if we are gonna have
any kinda togetherness,

41:37.930 --> 41:41.020
we have to start building
a relationship one on one.

41:41.063 --> 41:43.544
- That's not
an overnight thing

41:43.588 --> 41:44.676
to accomplish.
- I'm, well, I'm--

41:44.719 --> 41:46.112
we can't even
get through this.

41:46.155 --> 41:48.636
So, yes, I understand
it is not overnight.

41:48.680 --> 41:49.942
- Okay.

41:49.985 --> 41:51.944
- I trust Lauren's process,

41:51.987 --> 41:54.337
and what she has
in store for us,

41:54.381 --> 41:55.948
is a family retreat.

41:57.210 --> 41:58.690
- Okay.

41:58.733 --> 42:01.040
- So, maybe it-- that trip
is the place where we can--

42:01.083 --> 42:02.955
- Resolve some issues.
- Yeah.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.957
Lovin' ain't easy,
but we're gonna figure it out.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.219
We'll try.
- Right, love is not easy.

42:06.262 --> 42:07.699
You're right.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

42:07.742 --> 42:09.614
- All right, and on that,
I'll accept your invitation.

42:09.657 --> 42:10.702
How about that?

42:10.745 --> 42:13.574
- Oh, cheers like baby PJ.

42:13.618 --> 42:16.316
Cheers, okay.
- Cheers, okay.

42:16.359 --> 42:19.145
- It's a family retreat.
- It is, okay.

42:20.233 --> 42:22.757
- Next time, on
"Porsha's Family Matters"...

42:22.801 --> 42:24.150
- Porsha is gonna
get Simon to come.

42:24.193 --> 42:25.630
I'm gonna get Dennis to come,

42:25.673 --> 42:26.674
and you're gonna help me.
- Uh-huh.

42:26.718 --> 42:28.371
- There it is.
We got-- Look.

42:28.415 --> 42:29.503
Oh, my God.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.809
- Cheers to Mexico.
- Are you coming?

42:30.852 --> 42:32.375
- I already know Mexico
is gonna turn into--

42:33.681 --> 42:35.944
- Where are we going?
Mexico!

42:35.988 --> 42:37.467
- You ready for this journey?

42:37.511 --> 42:40.122
- This week is gonna be
about self-transformation.

42:41.515 --> 42:43.038
- What are you gonna do?

42:43.082 --> 42:45.563
- I know you're not
standing up, girl, bye.

42:48.304 --> 42:50.393
- This is what you get?
You started it.

42:50.437 --> 42:52.918
Ain't nobody had to do no robe
or nothin' for me to come.

42:52.961 --> 42:55.050
I just came because
I naturally wanted.

42:55.094 --> 42:56.617
- Don't talk to her
like that, exactly.

42:56.661 --> 42:58.314
- Okay, I'm going home.
I ain't gotta be here, bro!
