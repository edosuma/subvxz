EPISODE 2
HELL

01:26.920 --> 01:27.921
Sang-woo.

01:30.757 --> 01:31.966
You helped me. Thank you.

01:37.555 --> 01:38.640
And you did too.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.268
You saved my life out there.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.439
You're alive. That is what matters.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.747
You have all made it
through the first game.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.082
Congratulations.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.166
You're moving on.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.002
I will now announce the results
of the first game.

02:18.555 --> 02:22.600
Out of 456 players,
255 were eliminated,

02:22.684 --> 02:25.854
and 201 players successfully
completed the first game.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.819
Mister, please.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.530
Listen. I'm so sorry.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.282
I swear I will pay what I owe.

02:37.365 --> 02:41.077
I'll do it, I'll pay it all.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.496
Please, sir.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.999
I have a child.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.042
Oh! So young,

02:48.126 --> 02:52.463
I need to register,
and I still need to name my child, sir.

02:53.965 --> 02:57.760
-Please, sir, let me leave.
-Please. I'm so sorry.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.014
Sir, I'm begging you.
Let me leave and I swear

03:01.639 --> 03:03.516
I'll find a way to pay it all.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.934
-Let me go home.
-Me too.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.188
I can't keep going.
Sir, please, I can't go on.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.191
Please let me go home.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.277
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.655
We are not trying to hurt you
or collect your debts.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.868
Let me remind you
that we're here to give you a chance.

03:21.951 --> 03:22.952
A chance?

03:23.661 --> 03:24.913
We play some kids games.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.374
And you shoot us.
You want me to choose that?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.460
That's some chance.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.837
We may be in debt, sir…

03:32.921 --> 03:34.756
…but that doesn't justify killing us all.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.217
This is just a game.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.635
Killing everyone out there was a…

03:39.344 --> 03:40.511
game to you, huh?

03:40.595 --> 03:43.556
They were simply eliminated
for breaking the rules of the game.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.850
If you just follow the rules,

03:45.934 --> 03:49.604
you can leave this place safely
with the prize money we promised.

03:49.687 --> 03:52.065
Just keep your damn money. I don't care!

03:53.608 --> 03:55.944
Let me just go home. That's all I want.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.488
Let us leave. Let us go.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.990
Consent form clause 1.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.493
A player is not allowed to stop playing.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.204
Come on! You think
you'll get away with this, huh?

04:06.913 --> 04:08.414
The police will come.

04:08.498 --> 04:12.460
They'll bust in here any minute now.
They'll be here since we all disappeared.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.254
Yeah.

04:15.421 --> 04:19.467
And I bet they have
everybody's phones tracked here already.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.345
Look at all your hostages.
You're doomed if you don't let us go!

04:22.428 --> 04:23.346
We're all dead!

04:31.229 --> 04:32.522
Consent form clause 2.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.567
A player who refuses to play
will be eliminated.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.987
Consent form clause 3.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.490
If all the players agreed to stop playing,

04:43.241 --> 04:44.701
the games are allowed to end.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.369
Or am I wrong?

04:51.165 --> 04:52.458
You are correct.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.004
So let's vote on ending this.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.132
If the majority wishes
to leave this place,

04:59.716 --> 05:01.551
then everyone gets to go home, right?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.597
All right, as you wish.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.559
We will take a vote to decide
on the termination of the game.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.064
Before we vote,

05:15.148 --> 05:19.110
let me announce the prize money
for the game as previously promised.

06:05.698 --> 06:09.744
A total of 255 players
were eliminated during the first game.

06:09.827 --> 06:12.413
A hundred million won
is at stake per player.

06:12.497 --> 06:17.668
Therefore, 25.5 billion won of prize money
has been accumulated so far.

06:17.752 --> 06:21.130
If you wish to give up on playing,
the 25.5 billion won

06:21.214 --> 06:23.966
will be sent to the bereaved families
of the late players,

06:24.050 --> 06:25.426
100 million won each.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.930
However, you will all return home
empty-handed.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.100
Uh, sir…

06:33.643 --> 06:37.105
So then, if we can complete all six games,

06:37.814 --> 06:39.565
how much do we get?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.984
Since there were 456 players,

06:42.068 --> 06:45.154
the total prize money is 45.6 billion won.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.616
And with that,
we will now begin the voting.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.788
As you can see,
there are two buttons in front of you.

06:53.871 --> 06:57.542
If you wish to continue playing,
press the green button with an O.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.252
If you wish to stop playing,

06:59.335 --> 07:02.130
then please press the red button
with the X instead.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.090
After you finish voting,

07:04.173 --> 07:06.717
move to the other side
of the white line and wait.

07:06.801 --> 07:10.513
Voting will be done in reverse order
of the numbers on your chests.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.850
Player 456, please cast your vote.

07:43.671 --> 07:46.716
Player 453, please cast your vote.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.983
Come on.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.193
Player 218.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.763
Have you all gone crazy?

09:16.556 --> 09:17.682
We have to leave.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.350
We can't keep putting up
with this insanity.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.060
So what if we leave?

09:22.311 --> 09:23.813
Tell me, what changes?

09:24.814 --> 09:28.067
Just as bad out there
as it is in here, goddamn it.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.236
She's right!

09:31.195 --> 09:34.407
If we stop right now,
that only helps the ones who are dead.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.326
They'll get a 100 million won and not us.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.329
We made it through! They're out!
That money is ours.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.374
Please! Think about
what just happened out there.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.585
Come on, let's go!

09:46.377 --> 09:47.837
Where am I supposed to go, huh?

09:48.838 --> 09:51.424
Out there, I don't stand a chance.
I do in here.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.218
No, I've got nothing out there.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.430
Come on, let's finish this thing!

09:57.513 --> 10:00.975
I'd rather stay and keep on trying in here
than go back to the bullshit out there.

10:01.058 --> 10:04.270
You jerk! You got some kind of death wish?
Go die alone!

10:04.353 --> 10:06.355
Don't drag everybody else
into this, you little shit!

10:06.439 --> 10:08.190
-What the hell are you doing?
-Who are you--

10:12.361 --> 10:14.947
We will not condone any kind of act

10:15.031 --> 10:17.366
that impedes this democratic process.

10:18.242 --> 10:21.412
Now, let us resume and continue voting.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.075
It seems we're down to the last vote.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.785
Player 1.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.857
The doctor said there's a…

11:31.941 --> 11:35.027
a lump inside over here,
growing every day.

11:35.611 --> 11:36.821
Brain tumor.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.792
If you wish to continue playing, press O.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.587
However, if you wish to stop playing,
then press X.

12:26.537 --> 12:30.249
The majority of the
players have voted to terminate the game.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.835
Therefore, this game is now terminated.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.171
Hey! Okay, anybody who wants, they can go.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.965
But let the ones who want,
stay till the end, though.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.009
Half of us has died already!

12:40.092 --> 12:41.385
We can't just stop here!

12:41.469 --> 12:43.554
He's right!
Please let us stay!

12:43.637 --> 12:46.307
-We'll keep playing the game!
-Yes! Let us continue!

12:46.390 --> 12:50.352
It truly is a pity
that we must say goodbye to you like this.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.689
However, we will not completely
seal the door of opportunity

12:53.773 --> 12:54.648
for all of you.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.319
If the majority of you
wish to participate again,

12:58.402 --> 13:00.529
then we will resume the game.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.283
So, goodbye for now.

13:14.585 --> 13:18.506
Oh, help! Help! Hello!

13:18.589 --> 13:20.716
Help over here! I can't see anything!

13:20.800 --> 13:22.468
-Will you shut up?
-Huh?

13:30.309 --> 13:31.435
Who are you?

13:33.479 --> 13:35.481
-The pickpocket? You're the thief.
-Oh, shut up.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.566
-Is that you, huh?
-You plan on lying here all night?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.527
-Come on now. Untie me, you moron.
-Huh?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.785
Hang on.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.620
Oh, shit. Where are we?

13:51.705 --> 13:53.332
Hey. Untie me now. Hey!

13:55.167 --> 13:57.253
What are you… Oh, okay.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.296
Get dressed first. It's cold.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.423
I'm freezing too. Oh!

14:01.507 --> 14:02.883
Oh, yeah.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.301
Hurry up now.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.805
Oh, that hurts. Hey.

14:08.430 --> 14:12.518
Hey, stop. Come on, it's my turn now.
Huh? Hey!

14:12.601 --> 14:15.938
Wait! Wait. What are you doing?
You gotta untie me.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.024
Yeah, why is that?

14:19.108 --> 14:20.609
I just helped you. What the hell?

14:22.069 --> 14:24.238
Now, aren't you a little old
to be this clueless?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.115
I help untie you,

14:26.198 --> 14:28.409
then you're just gonna hassle me
for your cash again.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.286
Of course, I'm gonna hassle you.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.912
Okay, fine.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.874
Forget the money, okay?
Untie me, I beg you.

14:37.793 --> 14:38.752
Seriously?

14:39.628 --> 14:42.339
Yeah. I swear I'll forget the whole thing.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.674
How can I trust you?

14:43.757 --> 14:47.553
I swear it on my… on my own mother, okay?

14:47.636 --> 14:48.512
Pretty please.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.556
Oh, it's freezing. Goddamn it!

14:50.639 --> 14:53.183
That hurts. Shit.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.942
Hey, you little… Come here. Get back here.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.570
My money… give it back. Give it back now!

15:04.653 --> 15:06.530
Give it back!

15:06.614 --> 15:09.074
Give me my money! Give it back! Ow!

15:09.783 --> 15:11.660
Oh, shit. Give me back the money.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.955
That's all your mother means to you.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.293
You little… Hold on,
you stop right there. Hey!

15:20.127 --> 15:22.630
Hey! Don't walk away!

15:23.547 --> 15:24.632
God, shit.

15:33.682 --> 15:36.018
Excuse me, sir, where are we?

15:41.190 --> 15:42.191
Yeouido.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.820
Where exactly is… Yeouido?

15:51.533 --> 15:53.035
In the center of Seoul.

15:56.664 --> 16:00.834
Uh… sir, sir,
do you have a cell phone on you?

16:02.086 --> 16:03.921
Uh, would you let me borrow it, please?

16:04.964 --> 16:05.881
I'll be quick.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.308
That's 2,000 won.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.360
CYBER POLICE: SUBPOENA
HAS BEEN SENT.

16:26.443 --> 16:27.736
SANG-WOO, CALL US NOW
AND WE WON'T SUE.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.113
MR. CHO SANG-WOO,
YOUR LOANS ARE…

16:29.196 --> 16:30.030
SEOUL POLICE:
YOU ARE TO ATTEND AT ONCE.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.299
Thank you, sir.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.306
Hello?

16:57.057 --> 16:58.017
Hi.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.644
Yes, I had some work.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.147
I'm sorry.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.947
Here you go.
And thanks again, sir.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.951
Have a good night.

17:17.327 --> 17:18.412
Wait. Stop.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.497
Got money for the bus?

17:20.581 --> 17:21.457
Sorry?

17:21.957 --> 17:23.167
You said you live in Ansan.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.420
You couldn't afford the ramyeon here.
Got money for the ride back?

17:27.588 --> 17:29.548
-Money.
-No. No money.

17:30.090 --> 17:30.924
I'll walk.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.470
You'll walk… all the way to Ansan?

17:47.149 --> 17:49.109
Here, take this for the bus ride home.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.528
I can't. No.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.364
I don't have money to pay you back.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.868
I won't ask you to do that. Take it, okay?

18:09.129 --> 18:10.255
Thank you.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.673
Thank you so much, sir.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.886
Listen, I'm not your sir,
so stop calling me that.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.429
I'm sorry.

18:18.972 --> 18:19.932
Thank you.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.645
Thank you so much.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.148
Look, officer.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.692
You've gotta realize
what a massive deal all of this was.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.236
I know it sounds crazy.

18:32.319 --> 18:33.487
Okay, sir.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.532
So you're saying that your kidnappers

18:36.615 --> 18:39.868
rounded up hundreds of people
and had them play a game.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.870
Then went out there
and shot the ones who lost.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.247
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.165
And they didn't just shoot one or two.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.960
Those people had no mercy.
They killed more than 200!

18:48.043 --> 18:49.044
What game was it then?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.587
You know Red Light, Green Light?

18:51.755 --> 18:52.714
Wait, that's for kids.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.675
-Is that what they made you play?
-Yes.

18:54.758 --> 18:57.302
-And they forced adults to do it?
-I know how it sounds.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.012
And then they shot everyone
who got caught?

18:59.096 --> 19:00.722
How many more times
do you want me to say it?

19:00.806 --> 19:01.765
Mister.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.143
So where did they do it?
Where's the place they were killed?

19:04.226 --> 19:06.436
They had me knocked unconscious,
so how could I know?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.021
I said I don't have any freaking clue.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.523
Then give us the killer's description.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.817
They all had these masks on
the whole time we were there.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.569
Then, wait,
how did you manage to get out?

19:14.194 --> 19:17.406
Hey, look, the players came together
and put it to a vote.

19:17.489 --> 19:20.492
-And since the majority wanted to leave--
-Hold on, okay?

19:20.576 --> 19:22.161
You said you wanted to stop playing,

19:22.244 --> 19:25.122
and the killers, they told you,
"Sure, you can go." Just like that?

19:26.081 --> 19:27.708
Yeah.

19:27.791 --> 19:30.002
And what made you want to go there?

19:32.421 --> 19:33.589
Well, they…

19:34.548 --> 19:38.343
-they promised we would get money, so…
-Money?

19:40.387 --> 19:41.430
Yeah.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.515
We're talking tens of billions of won.

19:44.766 --> 19:48.353
Okay. Let me just sum up
everything you've told us so far.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.521
Just so I understand.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.689
You went to play kids' games

19:50.772 --> 19:52.774
because someone told you
you'd get all that cash.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.902
So then they had you play
some Red Light, Green Light,

19:54.985 --> 19:56.737
and they shot everyone who got caught.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.489
But when you said you wanted to go,
they said, "Okay, just go,"

19:59.573 --> 20:02.743
and you don't know what they look like
or where this all took place.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.077
Is that everything, mister?

20:05.913 --> 20:06.788
Yeah.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.041
What's your name, sir?

20:09.124 --> 20:11.710
I live in Ssangmun-dong.
My name is Seong Gi-hun.

20:11.793 --> 20:15.088
Seong Gi-hun, you got someone
who's taking care of you?

20:15.589 --> 20:19.134
If you want me to help, we can call around
and get you to a local medical center.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.302
What do you take me for?

20:20.385 --> 20:22.930
Look, I'm a tax-paying citizen
of Ssangmun-dong. Got it?

20:24.264 --> 20:26.141
Here's their number.
It's on a business card.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.185
Call and see what they say! Jeez!

20:56.546 --> 20:57.965
-Hello?
-Uh…

20:58.757 --> 21:02.094
Hello, yes, sorry for bothering you.
Uh, my bad.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.680
Um, would you mind if I ask you something?

21:04.763 --> 21:05.806
Who is this?

21:05.889 --> 21:07.391
-Well, I…
-Hey, you're not a cop, okay?

21:07.474 --> 21:10.018
Uh… Uh, sorry to call so early.

21:10.644 --> 21:14.606
Could I come play in those games there?

21:15.148 --> 21:16.817
Games?

21:16.900 --> 21:20.404
Uh, yeah. See,
games are my thing, you know.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.114
I'll play all the games you ask me to.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.865
-I'll do the best--
-Okay. Hold on.

21:25.742 --> 21:26.827
Who the heck are you?

21:26.910 --> 21:29.288
And why are you calling me this early
with this nonsense?

21:30.247 --> 21:32.666
If you wanna play games,
go to an Internet cafe.

21:32.749 --> 21:34.668
What's wrong with you,
you freaking pervert?

21:43.218 --> 21:44.928
You dialed
the wrong number! Let go!

21:45.012 --> 21:47.389
-Officer, don't do this. Please.
-We're sorry, mister. You better go home.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.642
You sure you dialed the right number, huh?
Better be sure you did!

21:50.726 --> 21:53.812
You'll see.
Look, I'll call and put you on the line.

21:53.895 --> 21:56.565
The right number's on my phone
from the call that I made already.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.774
Fuck this guy.

22:05.824 --> 22:09.077
I'm sorry. The number
that you have dialed does not exist

22:09.161 --> 22:10.954
or is no longer in service.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.999
Please check the number
and try again later.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.250
Please check the number…

22:17.127 --> 22:18.879
Who was that? Was he drunk?

22:18.962 --> 22:20.714
Some crazy hobo guy.

22:20.797 --> 22:22.799
Everything's crazy around here today.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.968
You, get a grip. Wanna go back in?

22:28.889 --> 22:30.891
Well, I'm out. Have a good one.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.353
Here. Goodbye.

22:40.776 --> 22:41.860
Hey, Ma.

22:44.571 --> 22:45.864
It's your son.

22:49.576 --> 22:50.494
Hmm.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.373
Ma?

23:00.295 --> 23:01.505
Where are you?

23:05.425 --> 23:08.970
The person you are trying
to reach is currently unavailable.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.265
Where'd you go?
You left the door open and everything.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.318
Sang-woo.

23:26.530 --> 23:27.864
What are you doing here?

23:39.751 --> 23:41.128
Is it because of your debt?

23:43.338 --> 23:44.464
Shh…

23:44.548 --> 23:48.635
Hey, come on, you're still
Ssangmun-dong's own pride and joy.

23:48.718 --> 23:52.472
You're still the genius who got accepted
to SNU Business School. So don't worry.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.598
You'll make money again.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.643
Go tell your mom all about it
and make a fresh start.

23:58.937 --> 23:59.980
Just make…

24:01.398 --> 24:02.691
six billion won?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.818
Six billion?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.280
I thought it was 600 million won.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.116
They don't know everything there is.

24:12.367 --> 24:15.745
And all those stocks that guy said
that you lost, you did that for real?

24:16.329 --> 24:17.789
It wasn't just stocks now.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.335
There was futures too.

24:22.419 --> 24:23.462
Excuse me?

24:24.838 --> 24:26.006
You bet on your future?

24:27.257 --> 24:29.718
What kind of bet was it
that you used that much money?

24:31.511 --> 24:33.763
-Did you get a girlfriend?
-Doesn't mean that future.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.809
Just forget it.

24:42.647 --> 24:45.650
Hey, file for personal bankruptcy then.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.569
Whatever they call it.

24:47.652 --> 24:50.280
I heard you won't have to pay
your debts off if you do that.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.949
I used my own mother's house
as financial collateral.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.493
And her shop.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.454
I put it all on the line.

25:07.881 --> 25:08.882
Who is this?

25:12.761 --> 25:13.929
Yeah, this is he.

25:17.641 --> 25:18.558
What?

25:18.642 --> 25:20.560
24-HOUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

25:21.978 --> 25:23.855
-Oh.
-She's diabetic.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.652
She left it untreated, and it got worse.

25:29.569 --> 25:33.073
She had to be in a lot of pain recently.
You didn't know?

25:34.241 --> 25:36.117
Will you be able to treat her for it?

25:36.785 --> 25:39.829
In the worst case,
she might need to have her feet amputated.

25:40.455 --> 25:44.459
Let's keep her here for now
and see how things go with treatment.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.009
Ma.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.057
Ma!

26:00.809 --> 26:02.018
Mom, where are you going?

26:02.727 --> 26:04.437
He said you need to stay here.

26:04.521 --> 26:05.522
I'm okay.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.816
But you're not okay.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.110
Hey, Mom, you can't walk around like that.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.112
Look, just stop it.

26:12.195 --> 26:14.239
You haven't been home in days now,

26:14.322 --> 26:16.533
out doing whatever it is
you're doing lately,

26:16.616 --> 26:18.660
but now you're a good son, huh?

26:18.743 --> 26:20.579
Mom, don't be like this, okay?

26:20.662 --> 26:22.581
You know how bad this thing could get?

26:23.206 --> 26:26.835
Tell me. Say I stay here
and they treat me,

26:26.918 --> 26:29.337
who's going to pay the rent in that case?

26:30.088 --> 26:34.009
Also, do you know how much it costs
to be in the hospital,

26:34.092 --> 26:36.886
not to mention how much all the drugs are?

26:36.970 --> 26:38.638
The insurance will help pay for them.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.516
Insurance? Help us?

26:42.017 --> 26:43.435
You canceled all that.

26:44.144 --> 26:48.064
Remember, you ended it
and used up all the cash we had.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.734
Will you please just get a grip?

26:51.359 --> 26:52.360
Goodness.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.072
Gi-hun.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.409
Let's stop. I'm too tired.

27:00.827 --> 27:04.998
I'm too tired to go on.
Stop arguing with me.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.208
Let's end this.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.634
Damn it. I'll get what you need.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.428
I'll get all the money you need.

27:23.767 --> 27:24.684
Hello, Ma.

27:26.895 --> 27:29.022
Heading over to his apartment right now.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.610
I'm sure he's fine, okay?

27:33.693 --> 27:36.613
He dodges our calls all the time.
You know what he's like.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.702
I can call everyone who might know places
he's hold up in before.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.455
If I can't reach him then,

27:46.373 --> 27:48.500
then I'll go report him missing tomorrow.

27:51.419 --> 27:53.672
I'm a police officer.
Have you forgotten that?

27:54.714 --> 27:55.965
I will find him.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.927
Yes, Mom.
Don't worry too much.

28:01.429 --> 28:03.473
How long
has it been since he came by?

28:04.391 --> 28:07.185
Well, I don't bother tenants every day.

28:07.268 --> 28:10.021
Still, I mean,
his rent was due a week ago.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.524
I've stopped by every day since then,

28:12.607 --> 28:16.027
he was never here, though,
and never picked up his phone.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.780
There.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.908
That's right.
Think you could pay his rent?

28:23.326 --> 28:27.038
Otherwise, you'll have to come
move all of his things out.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.584
I'll take a look now
and pay his rent later.

28:35.171 --> 28:36.506
Well, I'll be down the hall.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.605
THEORY OF DESIRE, JACQUES LACAN
RENÉ MAGRITTE

29:20.508 --> 29:21.593
Was he drunk?

29:21.676 --> 29:23.636
Some crazy hobo guy.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.305
Everything's crazy
around here today.

29:31.060 --> 29:32.937
Hey, I got ice cream, everyone.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.990
What? No ice cream for you, little man?

29:50.622 --> 29:52.290
How did you get your face like that?

29:53.625 --> 29:55.001
Did you get into a fight?

29:59.172 --> 30:00.673
If you're not gonna talk to me,

30:01.174 --> 30:02.050
I guess I'll just go.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.891
Wait. I don't wanna stay here, okay?

30:11.976 --> 30:13.812
Where's Mom? You said she would come soon.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.190
You told me that we'd be together.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.692
that I just had to wait a month.

30:23.571 --> 30:24.489
Cheol.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.660
-Listen--
-All the kids told me you lied.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.912
They said I'd never leave and…

30:32.539 --> 30:34.332
They said I'd get abandoned here.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.754
They're wrong.

30:41.464 --> 30:43.508
And Mom and Dad will be here soon.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.470
I swear, okay?
I'll make sure that they do.

30:50.932 --> 30:54.519
Don't worry. Listen, we'll all live
under the same roof next year, okay?

30:58.398 --> 30:59.440
I'm your big sis.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.735
I always keep my word, don't I?

31:12.912 --> 31:16.791
Ah, you mean the stupid game guy?
That guy?

31:16.875 --> 31:19.168
What do you need his name for,
Detective Hwang?

31:19.252 --> 31:21.671
I saw that he looked familiar to me.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.465
I think I know the guy
like to a family friend or something.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.466
Really?

31:26.050 --> 31:27.135
Let me think about it.

31:27.218 --> 31:31.347
-Something like Saeng or Seong or--
-Seong Gi-hun.

31:31.431 --> 31:34.475
-Ssangmun-dong is where he lives, right?
-You're right. Seong Gi-hun.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.810
Is he your friend?

31:36.728 --> 31:38.229
Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

31:38.980 --> 31:42.150
Uh, and how about getting his address too?

31:46.946 --> 31:48.615
Hey, Ali! Long time no see!

31:56.873 --> 31:59.250
-Hey, Ali.
-Why won't you answer my calls?

31:59.334 --> 32:00.668
You called, huh?

32:00.752 --> 32:01.878
And now you're here.

32:01.961 --> 32:03.755
What's up?
Is something wrong?

32:03.838 --> 32:06.341
Sir, stop. Pay what you owe me now.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.970
Yeah. Don't you remember?

32:11.054 --> 32:14.098
I told you, I've got no money.
Business isn't going so well.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.434
Look at what working here
did to my body, sir.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.978
I couldn't afford the hospital either.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.688
Now look here, I gotta go.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.815
-Give me the wages you owe.
-Damn it.

32:22.899 --> 32:25.401
Go and ask the rest of my employees
if they got their paychecks yet.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.362
I can't pay anyone till I get the cash!

32:27.904 --> 32:30.698
Hey, I got pain everywhere, Ali.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.618
I'm so damn broke. I need a doctor.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.912
You said you would pay us.
Where did it all go?

32:36.871 --> 32:37.914
-Six whole months…
-Come on.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.707
…and nothing
for all our hard work out there.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.376
Hey, you little son of a…

32:43.753 --> 32:46.297
Hah! I'm busy now. We'll talk later.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.596
Sir, give me my paycheck.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.099
Sir, please give me my money back.

32:56.182 --> 32:57.725
You little shit, don't touch me.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.811
Don't swear at me!

33:02.772 --> 33:04.273
I saw you have money.

33:04.357 --> 33:05.775
-Shut up!
-My money!

33:05.858 --> 33:07.235
Give it to me!

33:07.318 --> 33:09.529
Let me go, son of a bitch!

33:09.612 --> 33:11.155
Give me my money!

33:11.239 --> 33:14.158
What did you do, Ali?

33:14.242 --> 33:16.077
Stop that. Hey!

33:19.163 --> 33:20.206
Shit!

33:20.289 --> 33:21.874
Hey, you can't just leave!

33:23.751 --> 33:26.170
SOUTHERN MEN, NORTHERN WOMEN

33:27.797 --> 33:31.050
I completely understand
what your situation is like.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.803
But you know, it's…

33:34.345 --> 33:37.598
A broker can't be tracked down
once they've fled with all of their money.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.976
You aren't the only victim.

33:40.560 --> 33:44.355
There's some who went all the way
to Dandong to try and catch this one guy,

33:44.439 --> 33:46.858
they got caught by the Chinese police,

33:46.941 --> 33:49.277
almost got dragged all the way back North.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.612
My options, what are they? What do I do?

33:53.740 --> 33:56.743
Get another broker and try it all again.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.037
And I'm sure you already know,

33:59.120 --> 34:02.832
but you're going to need
to start the process over again.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.084
How much is it?

34:06.627 --> 34:09.922
We're gonna start by finding out
your parents location again.

34:10.506 --> 34:13.968
And security around the border
is now much tighter,

34:14.052 --> 34:16.637
so the price for helping them
cross the river shot up.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.181
So how much then?

34:20.725 --> 34:22.393
So you'll want…

34:24.312 --> 34:26.189
at least 40 million.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.317
Forty million.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.070
You're only paying
to get them to China, though.

34:32.153 --> 34:33.863
If you want to get them to the South then…

34:34.864 --> 34:37.784
That burns! Oh, that's fucking hot.

34:37.867 --> 34:40.328
Damn it.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.580
I trusted you and brought my money here
like you told me.

34:44.707 --> 34:47.001
That money is something
I risked my own life to get.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.712
Hey. Uh…

34:49.796 --> 34:52.340
I had no idea.

34:52.423 --> 34:56.344
I didn't know those people
would just run off with all your money.

34:56.427 --> 34:57.720
Please, I swear.

35:01.015 --> 35:02.141
Sure.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.560
I'll get your money.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.773
You pull anything on me…

35:08.856 --> 35:11.526
…I'll rip your fucking throat wide open,
and that's that.

35:13.027 --> 35:13.945
You got it?

35:35.800 --> 35:37.093
SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

35:37.176 --> 35:39.720
So,
have you been eating all right over there?

35:40.263 --> 35:42.849
Yes, I've been eating well,
so don't worry.

35:43.599 --> 35:46.936
I doubt that greasy American food
is doing all that much for you.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.438
-Tell me what you're eating.
-It's okay, Mom.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.357
There are lots of Korean restaurants.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.819
Oh, really? That's great.

35:54.902 --> 35:56.362
So when are you coming back?

35:57.738 --> 36:00.491
Uh, it's taking longer than expected,
so I'm not sure.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.327
-It might be a while.
-Oh, really?

36:03.411 --> 36:05.037
It sure sounds like it's been tough there.

36:06.080 --> 36:06.998
Hey, Mom.

36:07.081 --> 36:08.958
Yes? What?

36:13.004 --> 36:14.630
Excuse me. Hi.
Excuse me.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.674
I'll take three squids,
prepped and cleaned.

36:16.757 --> 36:18.301
Ah, yes. Wait just a minute.

36:18.384 --> 36:19.802
Sang-woo, there's a customer here.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.847
Don't bring me
back anything from your trip.

36:22.930 --> 36:25.433
I don't need anything over here, okay?

36:25.516 --> 36:26.976
-Okay.
-My goodness.

36:27.059 --> 36:28.769
I'm just worried that you might get me,

36:28.853 --> 36:31.147
you know, something that's really
way too expensive.

36:31.230 --> 36:34.525
All right, honey, you should go.
I love you, Sang-woo.

36:36.068 --> 36:37.528
You wanted a squid--

36:53.127 --> 36:55.504
Oh, he always gets me a little something

36:55.588 --> 36:59.675
whenever he goes on one of his trips,
he takes for work. Ah!

36:59.759 --> 37:02.553
A gentleman too. Sounds amazing.

37:03.679 --> 37:04.680
He went to SNU.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.516
For Business.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.978
Come on, Business at SNU?

37:11.979 --> 37:14.565
And he's not just smart,
he's handsome too.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.650
Is he married yet?

37:15.733 --> 37:17.401
Not yet. He's single.

37:17.485 --> 37:18.653
How old is he?

37:18.736 --> 37:20.196
I know someone he might like.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.157
Well, the man's standards
are set pretty high.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.452
Hi there. Excuse me.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.248
Are you Mr. Cho Sang-woo's mother?

37:30.331 --> 37:33.376
Uh, yeah. Cho Sang-woo.
Yes, he's my son, sir.

37:33.459 --> 37:35.294
Do you know where your son
happens to be now?

37:35.378 --> 37:37.588
On business in the United States. Uh…

37:37.672 --> 37:40.174
-Why do you ask, sir?
-Well, we're the police.

37:41.133 --> 37:44.428
I'm afraid that Mr. Cho Sang-woo
has a warrant out for his arrest.

37:44.512 --> 37:47.556
He's charged with forgery,
embezzlement, crimes that are all…

37:47.640 --> 37:49.267
some form of financial fraud.

37:49.976 --> 37:50.977
Huh?

37:52.144 --> 37:54.438
No, you can't be right.

37:57.149 --> 38:01.028
Uh, no, detectives. You know what,
you know what, there's a mistake.

38:01.112 --> 38:04.532
I know that my son
wouldn't do anything illegal. So…

38:05.241 --> 38:07.368
Listen, I'm sure you love him a lot.

38:07.451 --> 38:10.162
If he contacts you,
just tell him to come to us.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.331
If he keeps avoiding us like this,

38:12.415 --> 38:14.542
when they put him on trial,
it's gonna look bad.

39:32.286 --> 39:33.287
Who is it?

39:41.253 --> 39:42.254
Hmm?

39:57.478 --> 40:01.232
TIME: MIDNIGHT, JUNE 23
PLACE: SAME AS PREVIOUS

40:14.620 --> 40:16.580
Where did you get this money?

40:17.415 --> 40:19.542
Ali, where did you get this money?

40:21.919 --> 40:23.295
Listen carefully.

40:23.379 --> 40:26.799
Buy tickets for the earliest flight
for you and our kid and go home first.

40:26.882 --> 40:29.885
-What about you?
-You two should go first.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.513
I'll be there
as soon as my job here is done.

40:32.596 --> 40:36.976
Something is going on with you, right?

40:37.059 --> 40:38.769
Don't ask anything for now.

40:38.853 --> 40:42.481
You need to pack up and leave right away.

40:43.315 --> 40:45.776
I hope you can understand my problem.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.280
I love you. You and our child.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.077
I don't have any money.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.328
HEALING PUB

40:56.412 --> 40:58.539
Just lend me
three million won, please.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.207
I'll pay it all back.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.877
Friends shouldn't talk
to each other like this.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.045
You know how strapped for cash
we both are.

41:05.921 --> 41:07.798
I know that. Of course.

41:07.882 --> 41:10.718
You think I'm happy
asking you for cash, huh?

41:11.635 --> 41:13.679
Look, I'll come
and make deliveries for you, okay?

41:13.762 --> 41:16.891
I'm not paying for delivery man right now.
Look at my bar.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.642
Just the rent is too much.

41:21.395 --> 41:23.772
I'll pay you in a month, okay? Huh?

41:24.523 --> 41:27.526
I'll continue my chauffeuring
and come help around here.

41:28.694 --> 41:29.695
Listen.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.615
They told me she needs
to get surgery right away.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.783
Hey, honey.

41:35.367 --> 41:36.994
You should get back in here, okay?

41:37.495 --> 41:38.496
I will soon.

41:38.579 --> 41:42.041
Get in here right now, okay?
And put that out.

41:51.842 --> 41:52.968
Hello.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.013
-Gi-hun.
-Yeah?

41:56.096 --> 41:59.141
Coming out to someone's nice pub
and smoking outside is rude.

42:01.602 --> 42:02.561
Oh, yeah.

42:31.924 --> 42:33.008
Wait.

42:34.593 --> 42:35.803
Aren't you…

42:43.644 --> 42:44.853
Oh, it's a small world.

42:45.771 --> 42:46.855
It's you.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.651
-You are Player 456, right?
-Uh, yeah.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.069
I'm, um…

42:52.152 --> 42:54.238
-That's me. Yeah.
-What are the chances?

42:54.321 --> 42:56.657
So then, what are you doing around here?

42:56.740 --> 42:58.576
Actually, I live right down the road.

42:59.201 --> 43:00.369
Oh.

43:00.452 --> 43:01.537
I see.

43:01.620 --> 43:02.830
-And you?
-Ah.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.999
You come from around this area as well?

43:05.082 --> 43:06.792
Uh, no.

43:06.875 --> 43:10.588
I have a friend who lives nearby. So…

43:11.630 --> 43:15.301
There isn't anywhere
for this old man to go.

43:15.843 --> 43:18.846
I'm just staying there for a while.

43:20.306 --> 43:21.724
-Uh, goodness.
-Uh…

43:22.516 --> 43:24.560
-Would you like to sit down?
-Sure.

43:27.229 --> 43:29.440
What are the odds you're here
at the same time as me?

43:30.149 --> 43:31.400
What are the odds, right?

43:31.984 --> 43:33.193
You know I think…

43:34.194 --> 43:36.113
that we were destined to meet here.

43:39.199 --> 43:41.118
Uh, would you like a little?

43:41.201 --> 43:43.037
Mm. Sure.

43:43.829 --> 43:44.663
Uh…

43:45.456 --> 43:47.791
Is your head okay?
Are you allowed to drink?

43:47.875 --> 43:49.668
It's all right.

43:57.426 --> 44:00.888
Uh, sorry. I wish I have some food
for the two of us.

44:00.971 --> 44:02.139
Ah.

44:03.057 --> 44:04.224
It's okay.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.075
Oh, hey, hold on.

44:21.992 --> 44:23.911
You're absolutely sure
you could have this much?

44:23.994 --> 44:26.246
-I mean, you had a lot of already.
-Mm-hm.

44:33.545 --> 44:34.546
I…

44:36.048 --> 44:38.717
decided to going again.

44:38.801 --> 44:40.594
Hmm. Go where?

44:47.768 --> 44:48.769
You're going there?

44:52.356 --> 44:53.482
Since my…

44:54.608 --> 44:56.443
time's almost out as it is.

44:56.527 --> 44:57.569
I don't want…

44:58.696 --> 45:00.781
to sit around waiting to die.

45:00.864 --> 45:02.199
That sounds pathetic.

45:04.076 --> 45:05.285
And who knows

45:05.911 --> 45:10.249
I still could go and win the whole thing.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.335
When we played Red Light, Green Light,

45:13.836 --> 45:17.005
I got to the line even before you did.

45:17.089 --> 45:18.674
How could you wanna go there?

45:20.384 --> 45:22.261
But as soon as I got back here,

45:23.137 --> 45:28.016
I got some harsh reminders.
Yeah, what they say is true.

45:28.851 --> 45:32.855
Out here, the torture is worse.

45:47.494 --> 45:48.620
Hey, boss!

45:50.330 --> 45:51.749
What took you so long?

45:51.832 --> 45:53.959
All these stupid drunks
got into a huge fight

45:54.042 --> 45:56.003
as I was about to leave the bar
and head here.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.547
Ah, you know how it goes.

45:58.630 --> 46:01.675
Something about a Friday night
always brings out the weirdos.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.761
-The money?
-Oh.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.182
I couldn't get more on short notice.

46:08.265 --> 46:10.476
I'll make sure the rest
will come in soon, okay?

46:11.143 --> 46:14.646
And anyways, the Big Boss sent out
all the boys to find you

46:14.730 --> 46:17.191
Incheon and Ilsan,
the whole damn place had eyes.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.068
Where have you been hiding?

46:20.152 --> 46:23.238
We better not discuss that out here.
Did you drive here?

46:24.114 --> 46:26.033
Yeah, this way.

46:31.997 --> 46:36.210
So this is the invitation from that whole
Red Light, Green Light game, huh?

46:36.293 --> 46:37.628
Yeah.

46:38.420 --> 46:40.130
This one came yesterday.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.508
They're starting up again.

46:43.217 --> 46:48.096
So then, we go on Tuesday.
Gather all the boys and meet us there.

46:48.722 --> 46:50.307
Get some guns for us too.

46:51.517 --> 46:53.727
-Guns?
-They've got guns, yeah.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.355
Still, the pickup is only one guy.

46:57.689 --> 46:59.483
We'll beat up those masked shitheads,

46:59.566 --> 47:01.819
and then we break in
and take all the cash.

47:01.902 --> 47:05.405
I don't know. How am I supposed to know
how much of that is true?

47:05.489 --> 47:09.201
You bastard. Come on,
tell me what you're getting at.

47:10.786 --> 47:11.703
Sorry, boss.

47:13.121 --> 47:17.543
So they've got tens of billions of won
up in a huge piggy bank up there.

47:18.126 --> 47:20.504
As long as we hit them
with everything we got,

47:20.587 --> 47:24.716
no more dealing with those stupid drunks
at bars to make barely anything, assholes.

47:26.218 --> 47:27.511
Uh, boss, hold on.

47:28.387 --> 47:32.975
All the guys… you went into hiding
because you mess with the Big Boss.

47:33.058 --> 47:35.519
At this point, all of Incheon knows.

47:36.019 --> 47:37.521
Ahh!

47:37.604 --> 47:40.315
I doubt I'd be able to convince anyone.

47:40.399 --> 47:41.817
Hey, look here, you jerk.

47:41.900 --> 47:44.194
We're gonna do this
so I can get the money I owe him.

47:46.154 --> 47:47.197
So…

47:48.448 --> 47:51.743
in the Philippines, how did you lose
so much money at the casino?

47:53.537 --> 47:54.830
How did you know that?

47:54.913 --> 47:57.749
Boss, you should've known not to go
pushing your luck, you know.

47:57.833 --> 47:59.293
You little piece of shit.

48:05.173 --> 48:06.174
Deok-su.

48:06.258 --> 48:07.301
"Deok-su"?

48:10.804 --> 48:14.516
The guys from the casino
came here looking for you.

48:14.600 --> 48:19.563
They'll take your liver, your kidneys,
and your eyes for the money you owe.

48:21.023 --> 48:23.233
And now you're gonna die,
you fucking asshole!

48:45.714 --> 48:48.175
Hey! Welcome to Korea!

48:49.051 --> 48:49.927
Welcome!

48:50.677 --> 48:52.387
I killed Deok-su, okay?

48:52.888 --> 48:55.432
Come on! Come at me, you bastards.

48:56.558 --> 48:58.894
-Hey!
-Go! Kill Deok-su!

48:59.811 --> 49:00.979
Get him!

49:06.109 --> 49:07.319
Money?

49:07.402 --> 49:08.487
Yeah.

49:10.405 --> 49:11.531
How much?

49:14.201 --> 49:15.202
About…

49:16.244 --> 49:17.829
two million won.

49:18.580 --> 49:19.957
Two million won?

49:23.502 --> 49:24.544
Yeah.

49:29.257 --> 49:32.052
You think you can come here
and ask for that?

49:32.135 --> 49:36.390
You never paid child support
or any alimony or help us with anything.

49:36.473 --> 49:38.725
And now you're asking us
to give you money?

49:41.436 --> 49:44.648
I'm sorry. It's for… my mom.

49:44.731 --> 49:45.983
She was in the hospital.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.239
And how bad is it?

49:53.824 --> 49:55.325
She has diabetes.

49:56.493 --> 49:58.912
She needs surgery.

50:08.463 --> 50:09.506
Well, I'm broke.

50:10.257 --> 50:11.675
Things have been hard.

50:16.513 --> 50:17.806
Please, I'm begging you.

50:19.474 --> 50:21.560
Mom was always really good to you.

50:21.643 --> 50:23.437
Look how desperate I was to ask you.

50:24.771 --> 50:26.398
And I'll give it back.

50:27.733 --> 50:28.984
I really am broke.

50:29.526 --> 50:31.361
I just get money from my husband.

50:32.404 --> 50:35.073
Well, then could you,
could you ask him for it?

50:35.157 --> 50:36.241
You crazy?

50:38.201 --> 50:39.494
Hey.

50:40.370 --> 50:43.248
And what am I supposed to tell him
it's for if he asks, huh?

50:47.502 --> 50:49.129
Out. Now.

50:49.212 --> 50:51.298
-Hey.
-The kids' dad will be here soon.

50:51.381 --> 50:52.674
-Go.
-Hey.

50:53.550 --> 50:55.969
What the hell do you think
you're doing calling him her dad?

50:56.720 --> 50:59.306
-I'm her real father, okay?
-Oh, yeah? Tell me more.

51:00.140 --> 51:03.101
Go ahead. Why don't you tell me
what you did to deserve to be her dad?

51:03.185 --> 51:05.937
You-- Were you there when she was born?
Didn't think so.

51:06.021 --> 51:08.440
You know that…

51:09.274 --> 51:10.901
I told you all that, okay.

51:10.984 --> 51:12.402
And you know why I couldn't go.

51:12.486 --> 51:13.612
Someone collapsed at work.

51:13.695 --> 51:15.739
Yeah, well, I fainted too.

51:16.239 --> 51:19.284
I was alone and had to crawl
just to get myself over to the hospital.

51:19.367 --> 51:22.537
-And if I'd been any later, she'd be dead!
-No, I watched that guy die!

51:22.621 --> 51:23.830
With my own eyes!

51:24.623 --> 51:27.000
But no hospital, though. He couldn't go!

51:31.588 --> 51:33.590
Honey, we're home.

51:36.426 --> 51:37.844
You're home early.

51:39.387 --> 51:40.430
Um, hi, Dad.

51:45.685 --> 51:48.146
Hi, Mom!

51:49.731 --> 51:53.235
Come on in here, guys.
He stopped by to see Ga-yeong.

51:53.318 --> 51:54.444
Um…

51:55.112 --> 51:57.531
And now that I saw her, I'll get going.

52:00.909 --> 52:01.743
You're going?

52:01.827 --> 52:03.537
Yeah, I have an important meeting
to go to.

52:04.412 --> 52:05.622
Ga-yeong, bye now.

52:06.164 --> 52:07.624
-I'll see you soon.
-Hmm.

52:09.918 --> 52:11.336
-How do you open…
-Here.

52:11.419 --> 52:12.712
Thanks.

52:19.427 --> 52:21.429
Why did he come here this time?

52:22.055 --> 52:24.516
-Why did you let him in the house?
-I'm sorry.

52:25.308 --> 52:29.229
I was coming back from the market,
and he was waiting at the front door.

52:38.488 --> 52:39.573
Wait.

52:48.832 --> 52:49.791
What is that?

52:49.875 --> 52:51.126
You needed money.

53:03.430 --> 53:04.639
Thanks so much.

53:05.974 --> 53:08.310
Uh, I swear I'll pay you back.

53:08.393 --> 53:09.895
You don't have to.

53:10.854 --> 53:14.482
Instead, you can stop trying
to contact our family.

53:16.943 --> 53:18.695
It's tough for Ga-yeong, but…

53:19.487 --> 53:21.156
we're moving to the US soon.

53:21.239 --> 53:23.283
If you just keep showing up--

53:23.992 --> 53:25.327
You asshole!

53:26.161 --> 53:27.662
Do you think money solves everything?

53:32.209 --> 53:33.627
Dad, why?

54:07.786 --> 54:08.870
Seong Gi-hun?

54:11.081 --> 54:11.998
Yeah?

54:14.751 --> 54:16.169
Hwang Jun-ho, police.

54:17.754 --> 54:20.006
You recently made a report
at the station, right?

54:22.092 --> 54:25.387
You said a group abducted people
and make them play games.

54:25.470 --> 54:26.596
And you also said…

54:27.555 --> 54:29.015
some players were killed too.

54:29.766 --> 54:32.060
Oh, all that? Yeah, I just made that up.

54:32.602 --> 54:34.688
Yeah, a story I made up when I was drunk.

54:36.064 --> 54:37.565
They sent a card to my brother

54:38.858 --> 54:40.485
just like the one you had, sir.

54:42.821 --> 54:44.364
He went missing a few days ago.

54:46.992 --> 54:48.243
I just found it, I don't know.

54:48.326 --> 54:50.912
I saw it on the street
and just put it in my pocket.

54:50.996 --> 54:52.038
Mr. Seong.

54:53.498 --> 54:54.708
You can help me.

54:56.668 --> 54:58.003
I need to get him back.

55:02.841 --> 55:04.175
Why would you think…

55:06.094 --> 55:09.347
that I will be useful to you
or anybody else?
