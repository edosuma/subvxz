00:36.800 --> 00:38.160
Morning, Ryan.

00:38.180 --> 00:39.950
Wilfred! You know,
there is a gate.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.210
Why, yes, it is a beautiful day,
and I am well.

00:42.270 --> 00:43.870
Thanks for asking, mate.

00:43.940 --> 00:45.110
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've forgotten my manners.

00:45.180 --> 00:46.610
May I take your ax?

00:46.680 --> 00:49.510
All right, Ryan.
Angry irony noted.

00:49.580 --> 00:51.150
Want to talk about it?

00:51.210 --> 00:53.720
Ah, it's not a big deal.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.190
My ex, Paula--
she's getting married.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.250
How'd she dump you?

00:57.320 --> 00:59.220
Actually, I dumped her.

00:59.290 --> 01:00.760
Yeah, right.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.090
I did.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.860
We were dating for about a year,

01:03.930 --> 01:06.160
and then one night out
of the blue, we're in bed,

01:06.230 --> 01:07.830
and she sticks her finger
in my butt.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.300
Just like that,
without any discussion.

01:10.360 --> 01:11.930
Freak.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.700
If you dumped
a tidy piece like that

01:14.770 --> 01:17.240
over the saintly act of
knuckle-busting your anus hole,

01:17.310 --> 01:19.110
I'd say
that makes you the freak.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.210
What, I'm supposed to put a ring
on that finger?

01:21.280 --> 01:23.150
Ryan, I think
you're not being honest

01:23.210 --> 01:24.680
with yourself
about this breakup.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.880
There's a deeper issue here.

01:26.950 --> 01:29.720
- Deeper than Paula's finger could ever reach.
- You know what?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.350
I'm done talking about this.
I have a lot to do today.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.790
Yeah, let's get started.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.690
Take it easy.
I just said

01:34.760 --> 01:37.460
it doesn't seem fair of Jenna
to leave you alone all day.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.260
She is a single career girl
doing the best she can

01:40.330 --> 01:41.830
under extremely
trying circumstances!

01:41.900 --> 01:44.130
- God, your breath.
- I will not tolerate

01:44.200 --> 01:46.770
any criticism of Jenna.
She's perfect.

01:46.830 --> 01:49.600
Wilfred, I like Jenna a lot.

01:49.670 --> 01:52.140
Does she ever talk about me?

01:52.210 --> 01:54.870
Oh, oh. Oh!

01:54.940 --> 01:56.540
- What?
- Oh. Like I'd tell you.

01:56.610 --> 01:58.680
That would be an extreme
violation of her trust,

01:58.750 --> 02:00.350
now, wouldn't it?

02:00.410 --> 02:02.280
I know it's difficult
for someone like you

02:02.350 --> 02:03.750
to understand
that kind of loyalty.

02:03.820 --> 02:05.450
What are you talking about?

02:05.520 --> 02:07.090
I'm a loyal friend, right?

02:07.160 --> 02:08.560
You're fine, Ryan.

02:08.620 --> 02:10.490
I'm better than fine.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.290
I'm as loyal as you are.

02:13.860 --> 02:17.700
Mate, you are simply not capable
of my kind of loyalty.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.370
It's deep, profound.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.370
Wilfred, I'm a
very loyal person.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.170
I would do anything
for a friend.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.140
Talk is cheap, Ryan.

02:27.510 --> 02:30.410
But I know how
you can prove it.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.710
Christ, it's the 21st century!

02:32.780 --> 02:35.580
I can't believe these
racist rules still exist!

02:35.650 --> 02:37.450
I think there's a dog beach
up north where you...

02:37.520 --> 02:39.750
Oh, is there? A place that
allows the likes of me

02:39.820 --> 02:41.520
to swim in God's blue ocean?

02:41.590 --> 02:43.620
What an enlightened society
this is! Bloody hell!

02:43.690 --> 02:45.860
- I know it's not fair.
- Have you ever been in a sack race?

02:45.930 --> 02:47.630
What does that have
to do with anything?

02:47.700 --> 02:51.460
Everything has to do
with everything, Ryan.

02:51.530 --> 02:54.270
I've only been in
the ocean once.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.470
Just after I was born.

02:56.540 --> 02:59.410
There were seven of us...
stuffed into a sack

02:59.470 --> 03:01.840
and tossed into the frigid
waters of the Chesapeake Bay.

03:01.910 --> 03:04.280
Oh, my God.
I panicked.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.580
Hell, we all did.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.550
Clawing and biting,

03:07.620 --> 03:10.490
desperately trying to get out
of that burlap death trap.

03:10.550 --> 03:12.490
We finally broke through.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.620
By the time I got
to the surface,

03:14.690 --> 03:17.090
I realized I was
the only survivor.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.060
It was awesome!

03:20.130 --> 03:21.500
It sounds like a nightmare.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.500
You don't get it.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.470
You don't know what life is

03:25.540 --> 03:28.170
until you've tasted the
salty brine of death.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.840
I want to feel
that thrill again,

03:29.910 --> 03:32.610
and I ain't got too many
good swimming years left.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.680
This could be my
last chance, Ryan.

03:34.740 --> 03:36.650
Carne diem.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.180
Carpe.
Carne.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.580
It means "meat" in Spanish.

03:40.650 --> 03:42.550
How do you live in L.A.
and not know that?

03:42.620 --> 03:45.250
Cops patrol this beach
all the time.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.920
I can't let you swim here.

03:47.990 --> 03:50.990
Gave up on that "proving your
loyalty" thing pretty quickly.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.360
Wilfred!

03:59.870 --> 04:02.100
Just promise me
you'll be discreet.

04:04.340 --> 04:07.210
Ryan... I'm in the ocean!

04:07.280 --> 04:09.210
Oh, Ryan, watch this!

04:12.580 --> 04:15.150
Ryan! It's a pelican!

04:15.180 --> 04:16.519
It's a pelican!

04:16.589 --> 04:18.519
Dogs aren't allowed
on the beach.

04:18.589 --> 04:20.260
He's just a little excited.

04:23.260 --> 04:24.660
This was a pelican!

04:24.730 --> 04:26.530
- Oh, my God.
- It was a pelican!

04:28.830 --> 04:30.830
Shit.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.410
300 bucks!

04:35.470 --> 04:37.370
- Worth it.
- Oh, I'm glad you think so.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.240
And another hundred
for not having my ID.

04:39.310 --> 04:40.580
What happened to my wallet?

04:40.640 --> 04:42.480
I know I had it last night.

04:42.550 --> 04:43.910
Did you...?

04:43.980 --> 04:45.880
Look, Ryan, I want you to know

04:45.980 --> 04:49.380
that after what you
just did for me, well...

04:51.150 --> 04:52.820
I was wrong.

04:52.890 --> 04:56.220

- Wilfred!

05:59.660 --> 06:01.090
Oh, God, there you are.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.490
Oh, I was so

06:02.560 --> 06:04.430
worried about you!
Oh, I fo, und m

06:04.490 --> 06:06.560
in my yard, so we went for a walk.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.460
God, I am so sorry.
It won't happen again.

06:08.530 --> 06:11.100
Actually, I hope it does.
I think we were both feeling

06:11.170 --> 06:13.440
a little lonely,
but we had a lot of fun.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.540
Oh. Ohoh.
Oh! Oh, God, I am so glad.

06:15.610 --> 06:17.540
You know, I just...
I hate the idea

06:17.610 --> 06:18.770
of Wilfred being alone all day.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.410
Oh, did you miss me?

06:20.480 --> 06:22.740
Oh, God, that is
some serious dog breath.

06:22.810 --> 06:25.350
Must be the ocean water.

06:25.410 --> 06:27.120
I'll go rinse out.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.420
If you'll excuse me.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.880
Oh.

06:29.950 --> 06:32.220
Someone needs to get
his teeth cleaned.

06:32.290 --> 06:33.660
Well, if you're too busy
with work,

06:33.720 --> 06:35.560
I can take him to the dentist.

06:35.630 --> 06:37.360
Wilfred hates going to the vet.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.830
Every time I try to take him,
he just, like, freaks out.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.800
I can't even trick him
into getting in the car.

06:41.870 --> 06:43.400
He always knows.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.970
It's like, "Wilfred,
get out of my head!"

06:45.040 --> 06:46.470
- That's so silly.
- I know!

06:48.340 --> 06:50.210
But your idea could work.

06:50.270 --> 06:51.940
My idea?
Yeah.

06:52.010 --> 06:54.210
I can't trick him
into going, but you can.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.810
Oh, no, no, that's not my idea.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.910
Oh, no, no, don't be
modest. It's genius!

06:57.980 --> 07:00.250
- He'll never suspect you.
- Look, I don't think I should...

07:00.320 --> 07:02.520
If you pull this off, you
will totally be my hero.

07:02.590 --> 07:06.220
You make the appointment,
I'll take care of the rest.

07:06.290 --> 07:08.160
- What did I miss?
- Oh, you get

07:08.220 --> 07:10.490
to spend the whole day
tomorrow with Ryan!

07:10.560 --> 07:12.160
Yeah!

07:12.230 --> 07:13.730
Good luck.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.630
Good luck?
What's going on?

07:15.700 --> 07:17.830
Uh, well, it was going
to be a surprise,

07:17.900 --> 07:20.430
but I wathinking that tomorrow

07:20.500 --> 07:23.600
we could check out another place
that you've always wanted to go.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.370
- Sizzler?
- Well, no...

07:25.440 --> 07:26.570
- Titty bar! 
- Interesting.

07:26.770 --> 07:27.439
The movies!

07:27.440 --> 07:29.680
No. I mean, yes, the movies.

07:29.940 --> 07:32.080
You mean, like,
at a real theater?

07:32.150 --> 07:34.150
Yeah, and, uh, guess
who's got a new movie out?

07:34.210 --> 07:36.320
Matt Damon!

07:36.380 --> 07:38.790
Trent and Mofo of <i>The Morning</i>
<i>Zoo</i> both called it a triumph,

07:38.850 --> 07:40.390
and they so rarely agree.

07:40.450 --> 07:42.420
Well, how would you like
to see Mr. Damon

07:42.490 --> 07:44.190
the way he's meant to be seen,

07:44.260 --> 07:46.390
up on the silver screen
with dimples 30 feet high?

07:46.460 --> 07:49.160
Ryan, I am ashamed.

07:49.230 --> 07:52.070
I'm ashamed I ever doubted you.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.640
I love you, mate.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.370
Look, Wilfred...

07:55.440 --> 07:57.840
All set. Thank you.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.670
I don't know
what I would do without you.

07:59.740 --> 08:03.140
You were saying?

08:06.080 --> 08:08.350
I love you, too.

08:12.290 --> 08:15.730
And then after the movies, the
four of us can grab some drinks,

08:15.800 --> 08:17.300
get shit-faced
and take our tops off!

08:17.370 --> 08:18.540
What do you say, ladies?

08:18.600 --> 08:19.910
Cute dog.

08:19.970 --> 08:22.640
Sorority girls? Really?

08:22.710 --> 08:24.810
Ryan, we've only just
seen those chicks,

08:24.880 --> 08:26.950
and you've already found
a perfectly stupid reason

08:27.010 --> 08:28.350
not to get to know them.

08:28.410 --> 08:29.810
Kind of reminds me

08:29.880 --> 08:31.420
of something
you've done in the past,

08:31.480 --> 08:34.720
but I can't put my finger in it.

08:36.760 --> 08:40.289
Okay, we're almost there.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.190
Here's your 3-D glasses.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.059
They look like welding goggles.

08:44.130 --> 08:45.400
I know.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.060
Pretty high tech, huh?

08:47.130 --> 08:49.170
Put 'em on now.
It'll give your eyes

08:49.230 --> 08:51.440
more time to adjust
to the dark.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.970
I can't see anything.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.410
You will.

08:54.470 --> 08:56.410
You'll see everything
soon enough.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.340
What theater are we going to?

08:59.410 --> 09:01.980
Uh, AMC.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.550
I'm telling you, Ryan.

09:06.620 --> 09:08.320
These 3-D glasses
are not working.

09:08.390 --> 09:11.220
Don't take them off, and
have some more popcorn.

09:11.290 --> 09:13.090
Ryan, I want
to see the theater.

09:17.060 --> 09:20.530
Well... not
what I expected.

09:20.600 --> 09:24.070
It's not as big
as the IMAX, but...

09:24.140 --> 09:25.610
No, that's not what I mean.

09:25.670 --> 09:27.670
I just thought now
we're best mates,

09:27.740 --> 09:30.640
you might want to play
a bit of ball first,

09:30.710 --> 09:34.550
at least buy me a drink, but
no, you skipped all that,

09:34.620 --> 09:37.320
and went straight to
rooting me in the ass!

09:37.390 --> 09:39.250
Okay, I lied, but
it's for your own good.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.620
Jenna asked me if...

09:40.690 --> 09:42.560
Ah! There's the real story

09:42.620 --> 09:45.260
behind this treachery!

09:45.330 --> 09:48.430
You're using me
to get to my girl.

09:48.500 --> 09:52.130
I opened the door to my
heart, and you betrayed me!

09:52.200 --> 09:56.170
I'm sorry! I was just trying
to open the door to <i>her</i> heart.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.210
Ready for Wilfred.

09:57.270 --> 09:59.010
Why?

09:59.070 --> 10:00.510
So you can implant your
tracking device in my neck?

10:00.580 --> 10:02.140
Stay away from me!

10:02.210 --> 10:03.550
It's okay, Wilfred.

10:03.610 --> 10:05.450
You're just having
a panic attack.

10:05.510 --> 10:07.280
It's a conspiracy, Ryan!

10:07.350 --> 10:09.150
And you're playing
right into their hands!

10:09.220 --> 10:12.290
Yeah! Wake up, dumb shits!

10:12.360 --> 10:14.620
The American Veterinarian
Medical Association

10:14.690 --> 10:16.490
is a front
controlled by a shadow

10:16.560 --> 10:19.090
organization funded by FEMA!

10:19.160 --> 10:21.430
The puppet master
is Bob Barker!

10:24.230 --> 10:27.130
Don't let them take...

10:27.200 --> 10:29.570
my... balls.

10:39.220 --> 10:40.750
Hey, how are you feeling?

10:40.820 --> 10:43.750
I'll kill you.

10:43.820 --> 10:46.720
I'll murder you in your sleep.

10:46.790 --> 10:48.590
I was just concerned
about your health.

10:48.660 --> 10:50.260
Bullshit.

10:50.330 --> 10:52.290
This was meant to be
a leg-opener for Jenna,

10:52.360 --> 10:53.700
and you know it.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.330
- Hey, pooch, I'm gonna

10:55.400 --> 10:57.370
scrape out your gums.
- Wilfred,

10:57.430 --> 10:58.600
this is
Dr. Bangachon.

10:58.670 --> 11:00.270
I need a doctor,
not tech support.

11:00.340 --> 11:01.340
Okay, boy,

11:01.400 --> 11:03.670
time to go to sleep again.

11:03.740 --> 11:05.540
Count backwards from 100.

11:07.270 --> 11:09.980
100... 99...

11:11.310 --> 11:12.750
...98...
Wilfred,

11:12.810 --> 11:14.480
your friendship
is important to me.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.250
Save it, Ryan.

11:16.320 --> 11:20.120
My door is closed,
locked and bolted.

11:20.190 --> 11:22.260
98...

11:22.320 --> 11:23.390
98...

11:23.460 --> 11:25.760
Wait! You have
to understand,

11:25.830 --> 11:27.660
I-I just wanted
Jenna to like me.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.230
She does, mate.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.670
She fancies you quite a bit.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.270
Really?
Yeah,

11:34.340 --> 11:35.500
totally.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.070
Wh-Why am I
telling you this?

11:37.140 --> 11:38.610
It's the drugs.
So y-you're saying

11:38.670 --> 11:40.340
I have a chance with Jenna?

11:40.410 --> 11:42.010
No way.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.580
Never happen.

11:43.650 --> 11:45.550
Why not? I-I'm not
good enough for her?

11:45.620 --> 11:48.620
- She's so perfect?
- She's not perfect, Ryan.

11:48.690 --> 11:53.360
I just... say she is,
because I want so much for it to be true.

11:53.420 --> 11:56.290
But she has a flaw.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.360
A big one.

11:58.430 --> 12:01.000
Whatever it is,
it can't be that bad.

12:01.070 --> 12:03.500
It is bad, Ryan.

12:03.570 --> 12:06.600
She... has...

12:06.670 --> 12:09.170
What? What does she have?

12:09.240 --> 12:11.680
Mustn't betray her trust.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.510
Tell me!

12:13.580 --> 12:16.980
J-Jenna has...

12:17.050 --> 12:20.070
a... dick.

12:28.690 --> 12:30.690
Is <i>this</i> water
cold enough?

12:33.570 --> 12:35.530
It's too cold.

12:37.540 --> 12:39.240
Guess I should be used to you
disappointing me.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.470
I apologized for lying,

12:40.540 --> 12:41.970
and I've been your
bitch all afternoon.

12:42.040 --> 12:42.920
What do you want from me?

12:42.940 --> 12:44.740
Well, how about some painkillers?

12:44.810 --> 12:46.480
I've just had major surgery.

12:46.550 --> 12:47.980
You had your teeth cleaned.

12:54.590 --> 12:57.460
That's your first
decent act all day.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.130
Wilfred...

13:03.200 --> 13:05.160
You said something

13:05.230 --> 13:07.270
when you were under anesthesia.

13:07.330 --> 13:09.470
It was kind of funny, actually.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.070
I could do with a laugh;
what'd I say?

13:12.140 --> 13:15.370
Well, you told me a
secret about Jenna.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.580
You said she...
has a dick.

13:21.410 --> 13:23.510
That's not funny.

13:23.580 --> 13:25.120
I heard you say it.
I didn't. I wouldn't say

13:25.180 --> 13:26.850
something like that; why
would I say something like that?

13:26.920 --> 13:28.520
Some anesthesias
are like truth serum.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.350
Yeah, I was joking.

13:30.420 --> 13:32.260
You can't even tell...
So you do

13:32.320 --> 13:33.290
remember saying it.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.090
Yes. I mean, no.
I mean, I...

13:35.160 --> 13:36.500
I di't, but if I did

13:36.560 --> 13:38.700
I was joking.
Stop talking now.

13:38.770 --> 13:40.430
I-I did some research,

13:40.530 --> 13:42.330
and there's a rare
and unusual condition

13:42.400 --> 13:44.470
where women are born
with ambiguous genitalia.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.240
Is this what you were talking about?

13:46.310 --> 13:48.240
- Oh!
- Turner Syndrome?

13:48.310 --> 13:51.480
More like
Turn Her Around Syndrome.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.410
Jenna does not have a dick.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.650
She's perfect.
Is she?

13:55.710 --> 13:57.110
Or are you just saying that

13:57.180 --> 13:58.410
because you want it to be true?

13:58.480 --> 14:00.550
Ryan, drop it, I'm begging you!

14:06.760 --> 14:10.430
Nothing says thank you
like vegan tofu wraps.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.360
Great. I love tofu.
You're kidding!

14:12.430 --> 14:13.770
Tofu? Weak!

14:13.830 --> 14:15.700
Got us some big, greasy
Philly cheesesteaks.

14:15.770 --> 14:17.540
There's my brave
little soldier.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.440
Let me see those teeth.

14:19.510 --> 14:22.140
So handsome,
yes, you are!

14:22.210 --> 14:24.240
Should I open a bottle of wine?

14:24.310 --> 14:27.110
With cheesesteaks?
It's got to be beer, right?

14:27.180 --> 14:28.750
A woman who drinks beer.

14:28.810 --> 14:31.650
That's sort of...
rare and unusual.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.420
Oh, you mind if I
turn on the Brewers game?

14:35.490 --> 14:39.390
Aw, nice!
Bottom of the first!

14:39.460 --> 14:41.360
Catch it, catch it,
catch it, yeah! Whoo!

14:41.420 --> 14:44.290
Yeah! You are out of there!

14:44.360 --> 14:45.790
Don't...
Oh, yeah!

14:45.860 --> 14:47.660
Ryan is my boy!

14:47.730 --> 14:49.670
Yeah, Ryan Yount is awesome.

14:49.730 --> 14:52.430
Uh, Ryan Braun. Robin Yount
retired 20 years ago.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.740
Right. Just saying.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.610
Go Brewers.

14:55.670 --> 14:58.440
Yeah, you know, Robin
is a funny name.

14:58.510 --> 15:00.840
I mean, if-if that's your name,
I guess you'd have to decide

15:00.910 --> 15:03.480
whether or not you wanted
to be a boy or a girl.

15:03.550 --> 15:06.250
I don't think it really works that way.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.220
I mean, you're either born
a boy or a girl, right?

15:09.280 --> 15:10.420
Why do you ask?

15:10.490 --> 15:13.120
Well, I don't think I did.

15:13.190 --> 15:16.190
For the last time,
he does not have a dick.

15:16.260 --> 15:19.330
He?
Stop twisting my words.

15:19.390 --> 15:21.730
So, you're quite
the sports fan, huh?

15:21.800 --> 15:23.600
Eh, well, I didn't
really have a choice.

15:23.670 --> 15:24.770
I have four older brothers.

15:24.830 --> 15:27.170
Four brothers. Wow.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.370
Your mom was pretty consistent.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.940
I mean, after spitting
out all those boys,

15:32.010 --> 15:35.210
it must have been pretty tricky for
a uterus to switch it up for you, huh?

15:35.280 --> 15:37.580
What are you talouking about?
Seriously, Ryan.

15:37.650 --> 15:39.450
I'm just making conversation.

15:41.620 --> 15:43.420
Excuse me.

15:45.190 --> 15:47.090
I'm confused, Ryan.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.590
Why sell me out for
a chance at Jenna's heart

15:49.660 --> 15:52.230
if you're only gonna spend the whole night
cock-blocking yourself?

15:52.290 --> 15:53.630
"Jenna has a dick."
I heard you.

15:53.700 --> 15:55.100
People hear what
they want to hear.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.330
Why would I want to hear that?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.070
Because you're looking
for a deal-breaker.

15:58.130 --> 16:00.400
Just like you did with that
hot slut who finger-banged you.

16:00.470 --> 16:02.600
- This has nothing to do with Paula.
- Everything has to do with everything.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.200
No wonder you're lonely.

16:05.270 --> 16:07.240
As soon as someone
starts to care about you,

16:07.310 --> 16:09.040
you invent a reason
to push them away.

16:09.110 --> 16:10.210
And why would I do that?

16:10.280 --> 16:11.640
How the hell
should I know?

16:11.710 --> 16:13.410
I don't know how
your mind works.

16:19.190 --> 16:20.220
Can you hear that?

16:20.290 --> 16:22.160
Sounds like she's pissing.

16:24.130 --> 16:26.260
In the upright position!

16:26.330 --> 16:27.990
What are you doing?

16:28.060 --> 16:29.560
I was, uh... I-I was...

16:29.630 --> 16:31.470
Were you... listening?

16:31.530 --> 16:33.200
Well, n-no. Not at first.

16:33.270 --> 16:35.670
But it-it sounded like a...
a pretty steady stream,

16:35.740 --> 16:37.440
like you were
peeing standing up.

16:37.510 --> 16:39.410
What?!
It's okay.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.040
Mark Walberg has three nipples,
and he's a big star.

16:42.110 --> 16:43.440
But I don't pee standing up!

16:43.510 --> 16:45.180
I was pouring out my beer.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.350
I didn't want to finish it,

16:46.420 --> 16:47.320
because I'd had too much

16:47.380 --> 16:48.420
and I was embarrassed.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.680
You're acting weird.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.090
I should go.

16:51.150 --> 16:52.290
Jenna...

16:52.350 --> 16:54.020
Wait, Jenna, let me explain.

16:54.090 --> 16:55.720
I'm not weird.
I-I'm just...

16:55.790 --> 16:57.290
Aah! Holy shit!
Aah!

16:57.360 --> 16:59.360
That's research.

16:59.430 --> 17:01.800
Wilfred!

17:01.860 --> 17:03.970
Thanks for
a lovely evening, mate.

17:09.310 --> 17:11.740
Go ahead,

17:11.810 --> 17:13.640
say I told you so.

17:13.710 --> 17:16.780
No need to now.

17:16.849 --> 17:19.319
And just so there's
no confusion,

17:19.390 --> 17:22.290
this sound you're hearing,
it's not me dumping a beer,

17:22.359 --> 17:23.990
I am actually pissing.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.630
You were right, Wilfred.

17:27.690 --> 17:30.060
Everything has
to do with everything.

17:30.130 --> 17:33.560
Girlfriends, family, you.

17:33.630 --> 17:36.230
I've sabotaged every
relationship I've ever had.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.230
Yeah. This sounds
like a conversation

17:38.300 --> 17:40.540
you should be having with
someone who gives a shit.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.770
Good night.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.510
Give me a chance.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.180
Open the door.

17:47.280 --> 17:50.210
How can you be
a good friend to me

17:50.280 --> 17:52.580
when you can't even keep
from betraying yourself?

17:52.650 --> 17:54.090
I can change.

17:54.150 --> 17:55.550
I want to be happy.

17:55.620 --> 17:57.560
Christ! It's not
that hard, Ryan!

17:57.630 --> 18:00.060
Just get off your ass
and go and tell Jenna

18:00.130 --> 18:01.560
how you really feel!
But what if...

18:01.630 --> 18:03.530
What if! What if! Who cares!

18:03.600 --> 18:05.700
You want me to be
your friend, yeah?

18:05.770 --> 18:08.600
Well, trust me on this.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.400
Knock, knock, Ryan.

18:10.470 --> 18:13.410
It's time to open your door.

18:14.770 --> 18:16.710
Carne diem.

18:16.780 --> 18:18.710
That's the spirit.

18:18.780 --> 18:20.310
Now, march on over there

18:20.380 --> 18:21.910
and give Jenna
a reach-around.

18:23.550 --> 18:25.420
Ha-ha.

18:31.630 --> 18:33.130
Hey.

18:33.190 --> 18:35.260
Found someone
in the garden again.

18:35.330 --> 18:37.260
He was sniffing these.

18:37.330 --> 18:39.100
Sorry, I'll get
the fence fixed.

18:39.170 --> 18:41.740
No. I-I'm sorry.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.570
About tonight.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.410
Look, there's something
you should know about me.

18:47.470 --> 18:49.810
I've been trying
to hide it, but...

18:49.880 --> 18:53.340
it's time I tell
someone the truth.

18:53.410 --> 18:56.280
I know it's gonna
sound crazy, but...

18:56.350 --> 18:58.180
here goes.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.420
I'm awkward.

19:03.720 --> 19:04.660
No.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.990
I-I know, it's...

19:07.060 --> 19:08.660
shocking, right?

19:08.730 --> 19:11.330
Not all the time, but sometimes

19:11.400 --> 19:13.370
I get nervous and I say

19:13.430 --> 19:15.670
incredibly stupid
things, and...

19:15.740 --> 19:18.200
I hope you can forgive me.

19:18.270 --> 19:21.440
Well, Wilfred's a pretty
good judge of character

19:21.510 --> 19:23.510
and he seems to like you, so...

19:23.580 --> 19:25.280
okay.
Great.

19:25.350 --> 19:27.450
Oh. These are for you.

19:27.510 --> 19:29.150
Thanks.

19:29.220 --> 19:31.280
I don't get why
you get nervous.

19:31.350 --> 19:32.490
It's just me.

19:35.290 --> 19:36.820
Well, the thing is...

19:36.890 --> 19:38.560
Hey, babe, you got

19:38.630 --> 19:40.160
any man shampoo?

19:40.230 --> 19:41.560
Oh, uh, this is Ryan,

19:41.630 --> 19:43.260
the neighbor I was
telling you about.

19:43.330 --> 19:44.730
This is my boyfriend, Drew.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.800
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah, he just flew in

19:46.870 --> 19:50.070
from Wisconsin.
And, boy, are my arms tired.

19:51.540 --> 19:53.140
I'm just kidding
ya-- I feel great.

19:53.210 --> 19:55.110
All right, let's go
get you some shampoo.

19:55.180 --> 19:56.440
Thanks.

19:58.510 --> 20:00.710
Ah...

20:00.780 --> 20:04.480
I remember what I was
trying to say at the vet.

20:04.550 --> 20:08.290
Jenna has a dick...
for a boyfriend.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.220
You just now remembered that?

20:10.290 --> 20:13.630
Well, if I'm being honest, no.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.500
I lied.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.330
Guess that makes us even, yeah?

20:18.400 --> 20:20.200
Oh, but here's the good news:

20:20.270 --> 20:22.370
when it comes to me and you...

20:23.740 --> 20:26.110
...the door is open.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.580
What's in the bag?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.420
You like apples?

20:36.490 --> 20:38.090
Yeah.

20:38.150 --> 20:40.620
I got a bunch of
Matt Damon movies.

20:40.690 --> 20:43.290
- How do you like them apples?
- Oh, sweet!

20:44.760 --> 20:48.130
Seriously... what does
he see in Ben Affleck?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.340
I take exception to that.

20:54.410 --> 20:57.510
People fart much more
than they care to realize.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.240
I constantly am
smelling fart feelings.

21:00.310 --> 21:03.380
Sometimes it-it-it's fear...

21:03.450 --> 21:05.450
or lust or joy.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.020
Now, joy farts,
now, they are amazing.

21:09.260 --> 21:10.990
That would fit.

21:11.060 --> 21:13.090
Everything I need
to know about someone

21:13.160 --> 21:16.400
I can glean from their asshole.

21:16.460 --> 21:21.030
Some people think that eyes
are the window into the soul.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.900
Couldn't be more wrong.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.900
