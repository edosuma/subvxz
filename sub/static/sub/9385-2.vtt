00:01.168 --> 00:02.878
Previously on Family Guy.

00:02.961 --> 00:04.213
Oh, my God!

00:04.296 --> 00:06.089
Tell your father
not to start the car!

00:08.800 --> 00:10.052
Do you want
my badge number?

00:10.135 --> 00:11.803
Here.
Here's my freaking badge number!

00:13.263 --> 00:14.806
I can't lose this case.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.600
Lois, the case
is already over.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.143
( sobbing )

00:18.227 --> 00:20.270
Who did this to you?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.605
In all my years of research

00:21.688 --> 00:23.857
I've never seen a virus
reproduce this quickly.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.322
( screaming )

00:30.405 --> 00:32.407
Everyone I told
about the file is dead.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.326
What do you mean,
cut the blue wire?

00:34.409 --> 00:35.786
They're all blue wires!

00:37.913 --> 00:40.290
Face it. He's never coming
out of that coma.

00:46.129 --> 00:49.383
( screaming )

00:49.466 --> 00:53.220
Brian's gone to Los Angeles
to find himself.

Peter, don't throw out
Brian's things.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.299
It's not like he's going
to be in Los Angeles forever.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.925
He just needs to find himself.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.135
He's not coming back, Lois.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.344
You saw him.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.054
He just walked out on us.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.890
Boy, did we
have some good times!

01:38.932 --> 01:40.184
Here it comes, buddy.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.981
Oh! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh!

01:46.064 --> 01:49.359
Oh! What are the odds?

01:49.443 --> 01:50.736
Well, if he does come back

01:50.819 --> 01:52.988
I want everything
to be just how he left it.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.156
Easy! Massage the scalp.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.908
You're washing a baby's hair

01:55.991 --> 01:58.243
not scrubbing vomit
off your Christmas dress

01:58.327 --> 01:59.703
you holiday drunk!

01:59.786 --> 02:01.455
You guys, we got
a letter from Brian.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.956
Tell him I'm not here.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.458
Let me see.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.001
( yelling )

02:06.084 --> 02:08.086
Oh, I'm sorry, Sweetie,

02:08.170 --> 02:10.130
There. All better?

02:10.214 --> 02:12.424
You know, you are
some piece of work, lady.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.301
If you... actually, yes, it is.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.094
"Greetings
from California.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.763
"I've been very busy.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.431
"I'm having a great time

02:19.515 --> 02:22.351
"trying to make it
as a writer in L.A.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.853
"It's just as easy
as everyone thinks it is.

02:24.937 --> 02:28.315
I've been working the room
at a lot of Hollywood parties."

02:28.398 --> 02:30.359
Oh!

02:32.069 --> 02:34.821
Bobby, loved you in Raging Bull.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.573
Hey, Jodie, how's the baby?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.200
All right.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.370
Hey, I need more
cheese puffs, Manny.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.996
Looks like Oprah's
off the wagon again.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.207
And skip the toothpicks.
She'll just hurt herself.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.042
Hey, Bri, did you
hear about Jason?

02:47.125 --> 02:48.252
Paramount
bought his script.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.046
They bought
Death Spares Not the Tiger?

02:51.129 --> 02:52.214
Hundred grand.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.423
Pretty good, huh?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.217
Sheesh! He's been
in L.A. how long?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.635
Unbelievable.

02:56.718 --> 02:57.845
You know, he actually

02:57.928 --> 02:59.805
called the main character
"John Everyman"?

02:59.888 --> 03:01.431
Come on.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.433
Well, good for him.

03:05.269 --> 03:08.146
( takes a deep breath )

03:13.110 --> 03:15.863
Keanu Reeves. Wow!

03:15.946 --> 03:17.447
You know, I don't
usually gush

03:17.531 --> 03:19.157
so you'll have
to forgive me

03:19.241 --> 03:21.201
but when I was
writing Coast Guard--

03:21.285 --> 03:22.911
that's what I do--
I'm a writer.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.122
Anyway, when I was
writing Coast Guard

03:25.205 --> 03:27.416
I couldn't think
of anyone other than...

03:27.499 --> 03:29.668
uh-uh... there's a woodpecker
on your head.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.378
Yeah,
he comes and goes.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.591
And now back to
Kids Say the Darndest Things.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.426
It's okay.
Take your time.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.011
Then what happened?

03:39.094 --> 03:43.432
He... he said he would kill me
if I ever said anything.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.517
Do you remember
what he looked like?

03:45.601 --> 03:48.270
Yeah. He had a scar on his arm

03:48.353 --> 03:51.523
and he had a big,
stupid doo-doo head!

03:51.607 --> 03:55.110
"A big, stupid
doo-doo head!"

03:57.654 --> 04:01.116
Honestly, the things
children come up with.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.243
If you have a child you'd like
to exploit in order to get

04:03.327 --> 04:04.745
a free trip to Los Angeles

04:04.828 --> 04:06.413
why not have them
try out for our show?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.457
Our next auditions will
be held in New York, Chicago

04:08.540 --> 04:09.917
and Quahog, Rhode Island.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.085
Hey, maybe Stewie
could get on that show.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.546
Eh! You must be 'shrooming.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.299
Yeah! We can get a free trip
to L.A., and see Brian.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.092
Jeez, I haven't been
to California

04:19.176 --> 04:20.719
since I lived
with my other family.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.722
Guys. I just
got invited

04:23.805 --> 04:25.933
to a party at
Sharon Tate's house.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.059
You guys can come

04:27.142 --> 04:28.268
but you got
to promise

04:28.352 --> 04:29.520
not to embarrass me.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.397
Talk, damn you!

04:32.481 --> 04:33.690
I know you've
been plotting

04:33.774 --> 04:35.484
to foil my plans
of world domination.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.735
Who are you working for?

04:36.818 --> 04:37.903
The Libyans? The French?

04:38.904 --> 04:40.030
Very well.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.406
If torture won't work

04:41.490 --> 04:43.200
perhaps a little
tenderness will.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.160
Mmm! I like
your taste in women.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.662
Yes, I think she and I

04:46.745 --> 04:49.289
are going to have
a good time together.

04:49.373 --> 04:51.750
Yes, you like this, don't you?

04:51.834 --> 04:55.379
Oh, God, look at me,
having sex with a pig.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.548
I've become my father.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.757
Come on, Stewie.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.092
Let's get your sailor suit.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.468
You got to look cute

05:01.552 --> 05:03.095
if you're auditioning
for national television.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.596
Lois, I told you.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.181
There's no way...

05:06.265 --> 05:07.850
National television, you say?

05:07.933 --> 05:09.351
Coast to coast?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.854
Well, that could
be the ideal place

05:11.937 --> 05:14.273
to unleash
my mass-hypnosis device

05:14.356 --> 05:16.275
on the unsuspecting public.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.027
Oh, I always loved
this little sailor suit.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.196
Or we could do nice
corduroys and a sweater.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.781
Or you could make
yourself useful

05:22.865 --> 05:23.907
and wipe my button.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.868
Circular motion,
one finger--

05:25.951 --> 05:27.411
and don't you
look at me!

05:32.791 --> 05:34.960
Oh, my God,
that's Michael Eisner.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.171
I... I'll take it
from here, Julio.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.216
Uh... here you go,
Mr. Eisner.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.427
It's, uh... it's
been Brianized.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.096
You might notice
that new script smell.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.391
Every car I hand-wash comes
with a smile, an air freshener,

05:49.474 --> 05:52.186
and a copy on my can't-miss,
coming-of-age teen comedy

05:52.269 --> 05:53.687
set in Wisconsin.

05:53.770 --> 05:54.980
-What's your name?
-Brian.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.565
Let's see.

05:56.648 --> 05:57.941
There we go...

05:58.025 --> 06:00.360
Brian.

06:00.444 --> 06:01.945
See you
at Disneyland.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.488
Bring money.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.164
Look. It's Tom Tucker
from The News.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.790
And that must
be his son.

06:14.583 --> 06:15.709
Oh, my.

06:15.792 --> 06:16.960
I feel bad staring

06:17.044 --> 06:18.462
without having paid
for a ticket.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.048
I mean, really, how am
I supposed to follow that act?

06:21.131 --> 06:22.174
Bite the head off a chicken?

06:22.257 --> 06:23.800
Dad, they're
staring at me.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.093
They're just jealous.

06:25.886 --> 06:26.970
Ew!

06:27.054 --> 06:28.055
Uh... you're next.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.890
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait. We were next.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.434
Hey! Hey, don't
walk away from me!

06:32.518 --> 06:34.061
Hey!

06:34.144 --> 06:35.437
( sighs )

06:35.521 --> 06:36.563
You know what
we're going to do?

06:36.647 --> 06:38.357
We're going to get
the video camera out

06:38.440 --> 06:39.525
and we'll
make our own show.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.485
I don't want to!
Yes, you do.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.862
You do because
it's normal.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.242
Tell us, Stewie,
what job does a mommy do?

06:48.325 --> 06:49.868
Oh, interesting question.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.496
More to the point,
how does one define "job"

06:52.579 --> 06:55.207
without branding oneself
with useless labels?

06:55.290 --> 06:56.834
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.211
I'm afraid I answered your
question with another question.

06:59.545 --> 07:02.548
Um... how old
do you think Daddy is?

07:02.631 --> 07:03.882
42.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.718
Oh, um... uh...

07:06.802 --> 07:08.762
I mean... I mean... Daddy's old!

07:08.846 --> 07:10.222
I think he's seven.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.682
( all laughing )

07:11.807 --> 07:12.975
Yeah, that's it.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.686
That's what you want to hear,
isn't it?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.813
Yes, yes.
Jump through the hoop.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.439
Daddy's feet smell!

07:19.523 --> 07:21.233
( under breath ):
Oh... jackasses.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.820
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
he's adorable.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.613
Congratulations.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.699
Stewie's going
to be on the show.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.033
Did you
hear that, Lois?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.368
We're going
to Hollywood--

07:31.451 --> 07:33.412
where the people
are sexy and clever

07:33.495 --> 07:35.330
and they always
say something funny

07:35.414 --> 07:37.249
right before
the commercial break.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.342
Oh, great.

07:47.426 --> 07:50.179
I always end up sitting
next to a damn baby.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.471
What? What
did you just say?

07:51.555 --> 07:52.931
Stewie, stop fussing.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.016
Not now, Lois.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.559
Hey, big man,
turn around.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.685
If you've got
something to say

07:56.768 --> 07:57.978
say it to my face!

07:58.061 --> 07:59.855
Oh, you can't
hear me now?

07:59.938 --> 08:01.273
All right, that's it.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.442
I was going to watch
the movie, but forget it.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.360
For the next five hours,
you're my bitch.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.404
Waa! Waa!
My ears are popping

08:07.487 --> 08:10.115
and there's no way
to console me.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.743
I'm hungry, and
possibly teething!

08:12.826 --> 08:14.494
Maybe I'm wet.

08:14.578 --> 08:15.704
Who knows?

08:15.787 --> 08:16.997
I'm a baby.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.332
Waa! Waa!

08:21.919 --> 08:23.212
( machine beeps )

08:23.295 --> 08:25.422
Yeah, uh...
this is a message for Brian.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.257
This is Jack Nicholson.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.968
Uh... listen,
I read your script

08:30.052 --> 08:32.721
and it just, uh... you know,
jumped right off the page.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.556
Uh... I think it's something

08:34.640 --> 08:38.143
I'd be excited to be a part of,
so, uh... call my, uh... but...

08:38.227 --> 08:39.520
( laughing )

08:39.603 --> 08:42.981
Listen,
I'm just jacking you, man.

08:43.065 --> 08:46.151
Me and my buddy Phil just found
your script at Starbucks

08:46.235 --> 08:47.236
Phil:
Tell him it sucks.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.820
Yeah, it sucks!

08:48.904 --> 08:50.906
Give it up, loser.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.117
And don't put your number
on the cover, you stupid.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.744
I'm hungry.

08:55.827 --> 08:56.870
( hangs up )

08:56.954 --> 08:57.955
( phone rings )

08:58.038 --> 08:59.164
Jasper's residence.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.083
Who the hell is Jasper?
Where's Brian?

09:01.166 --> 09:02.543
Peter? It's me.

09:02.626 --> 09:03.710
Jasper's my cousin.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.337
I'm using his place while
he's working at Club Med.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.588
Are you on a cell phone?

09:06.672 --> 09:07.881
Yeah, we're in L.A.

09:07.965 --> 09:11.593
What?! Uh... what
a terrific surprise.

09:11.677 --> 09:14.638
Brian, can we see you
for dinner?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.515
Yeah... yeah, you're not too
famous to get together

09:16.598 --> 09:17.933
with your old family, are you?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.393
Well, I, uh... uh...

09:19.476 --> 09:20.894
I was invited to the premiere
of the new, uh...

09:24.481 --> 09:26.567
the new Val Kilmer picture

09:26.650 --> 09:28.902
but I'd much rather take
you guys out to dinner.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.612
How about Musso and Frank's,
8:00?

09:30.696 --> 09:34.575
Okay. See you later,
Mr. Big Shot...

09:34.658 --> 09:36.201
Oh, crap. I didn't push "end."

09:36.285 --> 09:37.953
This is going to cost me
a fortune.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.580
( beep )

09:41.373 --> 09:42.916
Brian! Okay, I'm back.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.251
Tell me everything.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.419
I'm sitting, I'm hearing.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.962
That's Ricardo,
Ricardo, Brian.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.172
He doesn't speak
any English.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.256
Can I?
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.883
Catching up-- okay,
me first.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.968
I'm in love... ooh,
too much dressing.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.261
He's from the Philippines.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.221
I know, I know,
I'm a rice queen.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.098
So how's the writing
thingie going?

09:58.182 --> 10:00.017
Terrible. I can't even
get my foot in the door.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.894
Oh, okay, I have somebody
you have to meet.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.395
He's a producer. He's great.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.397
Really? Oh, thanks.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.815
That would be great.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.317
So, do you like
Sex in the City?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.693
Yeah, it's an
all right show.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.029
I wasn't talking
about the show.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.197
Ooh, I'm nasty!

10:13.280 --> 10:14.573
( imitates horn honking )

10:14.656 --> 10:15.782
Someone send me
out to sea.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.912
Ooh... it says here

10:19.995 --> 10:21.288
that this is
the actual gutter

10:21.371 --> 10:22.915
where the policeman
fell over laughing

10:22.998 --> 10:24.249
after Eddie Murphy told him

10:24.333 --> 10:26.001
he was just giving the
transvestite a ride home.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.753
( phone rings )

10:27.836 --> 10:29.046
Oh, I think that's me.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.214
Hello?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.840
Hey, hey, Peter,
it's Quagmire.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.675
Oh, hey, Quagmire.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.637
Guess what? Last night
I had sex with a black chick.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.305
Uh, I gotta go.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.890
Huh. Sorry.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.975
What? All he said
was "black chick."

10:42.059 --> 10:43.769
Yeah, I know, but your
boyfriend looks like

10:43.852 --> 10:45.187
one of your typical
angry black guys

10:45.270 --> 10:46.647
and I didn't want
to offend him.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.232
Hey, we cool, G'?

10:48.315 --> 10:49.316
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

10:49.399 --> 10:50.692
All right.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.906
I, uh... I was thinking
Halle Berry

10:55.989 --> 10:57.366
would be perfect
as the camp counselor

10:57.449 --> 10:58.534
all the kids want
to get with.

10:58.617 --> 10:59.618
Jasper was right.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.161
You're very talented.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.121
You know, I'm having
a brainstorm here.

11:03.205 --> 11:04.873
Have you ever thought
about directing?

11:04.957 --> 11:06.834
Oh, just every waking hour!

11:06.917 --> 11:07.918
Well, I got this movie.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.211
I'm not going to lie.

11:09.294 --> 11:12.047
It's a low-budget movie,
but the script is solid.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.299
My director dropped out
and I need somebody

11:14.383 --> 11:16.218
who's smart, ambitious
and not addicted to meth.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.011
Well, I am smart and ambitious.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.638
( both laughing )

11:19.721 --> 11:21.014
Seriously.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.140
No, no. I'm clean.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.145
Brian:
You know, uh, Musso and Frank's is famous.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.897
See the bar over there?

11:28.981 --> 11:31.066
Great writers like Hemmingway
and Faulkner drank there.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.318
Hey... hey, where'd that guy
who wrote Porky's drink?

11:33.402 --> 11:35.070
Huh? Huh? Oh, man.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.990
When that fat broad grabbed that
kid's crank through the hole--

11:38.073 --> 11:39.616
Ah! Where do they get
their ideas?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.118
Huh? Where do they get 'em?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.661
You're the writer. You tell me.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.496
Oh, boy, this is great.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.664
All that searching--

11:45.747 --> 11:47.541
that emptiness I felt
back home-- gone.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.085
I think I've finally found
my life's calling, you know?

11:50.169 --> 11:52.379
Oh, how wonderful.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.590
You know, Brian, I've
always found your writing

11:54.673 --> 11:56.175
to be a little hackneyed
and stilted

11:56.258 --> 11:57.426
but I guess that's why

11:57.509 --> 11:58.969
I'm not working out
here in Hollywood, huh?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.054
( chuckles)

12:01.138 --> 12:04.349
Oh, congratulations
on all your success.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.560
Uh... th-thank you.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.645
Hey, you know what might be
a thrill for you guys?

12:08.729 --> 12:10.314
Ooh! Ooh! Eating a pebble!

12:10.397 --> 12:13.066
Yes, but I was talking
about stopping by the set

12:13.150 --> 12:14.443
to see me in action.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.612
Brian, could
we really?

12:16.695 --> 12:19.656
Well, you, uh, you do know
somebody in the business.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.909
Yes, well, I'm
in the business, too, you know.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.535
I'm going to be on television.

12:23.619 --> 12:24.703
Great.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.038
Yes, and when I make
my appearance

12:26.121 --> 12:27.664
I promise you'll all
be talking about it

12:27.748 --> 12:29.374
at the watercooler
the next day.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.751
Yeah. Well, good luck with that.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.170
"Yeah, well, good luck
with that." Yutz.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.464
( phone rings )

12:35.547 --> 12:37.716
( Woman on phone ):
Hello. I'm trying to reach Peter Griffin.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.176
You're in him.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.136
Mr. Griffin, are you happy
with your long distance service?

12:41.220 --> 12:43.222
Yes, and I'm sick and tired

12:43.305 --> 12:45.015
of you people
always calling during dinner.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.600
I demand to speak
to your supervisor.

12:46.683 --> 12:47.809
Hold, please.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.354
( mainstream '70s pop playing )

12:50.437 --> 12:52.481
Oh, Peter, I love this song.

12:52.564 --> 12:53.565
Open your mouth.

12:53.649 --> 12:56.735
♪♪ Looks like we made it... ♪♪

12:58.570 --> 13:01.114
Brian. Right on time--
I like that.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.866
Come in.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.076
So, ready?

13:04.159 --> 13:05.577
Ready to shoot
your first scene?

13:05.661 --> 13:06.828
I sure am.
Where's the set?

13:06.912 --> 13:07.996
Second door on your left.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.256
So... this is some kind
of shampoo commercial, right?

13:17.339 --> 13:19.508
Do I have to sleep
with the dog in this one?

13:19.591 --> 13:20.926
Hey, can someone fluff Paul?

13:21.009 --> 13:23.220
He's got, like,
a wind sock thing going on.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.723
So this is some kind
of shampoo commercial, right?

13:31.103 --> 13:32.354
Look, Zack, I'm... I'm sorry.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.814
There's just no way
I can do this.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.774
I mean, I've been around,
you know, I've...

13:35.858 --> 13:37.609
I've licked my share
of peanut butter

13:37.693 --> 13:39.528
but... I-I just... I think
you need to find yourself

13:39.611 --> 13:40.696
a new director.

13:40.779 --> 13:41.822
Are you sure?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.448
I just can't do this.

13:43.532 --> 13:45.701
Come on. Is this any more
degrading than washing cars?

13:45.784 --> 13:47.578
At least here, you
can be creative.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.955
Look, I... I want to make this
perfectly clear.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.791
There is absolutely no way
I would possibly consider

13:52.875 --> 13:54.251
doing something like this.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.962
Unless I saw a script first.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.089
Of course.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.759
You know, this isn't bad.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.845
It's kind of like
Bang the Drum Slowly

14:04.928 --> 14:06.346
Except the drum's
a chick.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.517
( horn honks )

14:10.601 --> 14:12.144
( tires squeal )

14:12.227 --> 14:13.896
Peter, slow down.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.190
Brian said he was going
to be on the set all day.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.025
Ah! "On the set." Listen to me!

14:18.108 --> 14:20.694
Two days in Hollywood, and I
sound like a contract player.

14:20.777 --> 14:21.778
( laughs )

14:21.862 --> 14:23.405
( siren blaring )

14:23.488 --> 14:26.241
Oh, crap-- The L.A.P.D.

14:26.325 --> 14:29.536
( grunting )

14:29.620 --> 14:32.039
Come on, Peter,
want to save some tape

14:32.122 --> 14:33.582
for the Hollywood sign.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.126
Okay. Hey, thanks a lot,
you guys.

14:36.210 --> 14:37.336
Hey, our pleasure.

14:37.419 --> 14:38.754
Have a nice vacation, sir.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.838
Ooh!

14:41.340 --> 14:43.050
Woman:
Yes... yes...

14:43.133 --> 14:44.176
Yes...

14:44.259 --> 14:45.844
( panting )

14:45.928 --> 14:47.387
Yes...

14:47.471 --> 14:48.889
Yes...
Cut.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.433
Uh, okay. Uh, nice
take, Jenna.

14:51.517 --> 14:54.436
But, uh, let's try giving the lines
a little subtext this time.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.022
Your husband's always
away on business

14:57.105 --> 14:59.316
and you feel increasingly
isolated and unloved

14:59.399 --> 15:00.776
so you begin to think

15:00.859 --> 15:02.444
maybe you should go back
to graduate school

15:02.528 --> 15:03.904
and finish your dissertation

15:03.987 --> 15:05.822
and that's when you notice
the cable man

15:05.906 --> 15:07.157
has taken his pants off.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.076
Oh, wow!

15:09.159 --> 15:10.327
A real movie set!

15:10.410 --> 15:11.995
Hey, this house looks
kind of familiar.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.456
I'll bet Samuel L. Jackson
is here.

15:14.540 --> 15:15.707
He's in everything.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.209
There's Brian!

15:17.292 --> 15:19.086
All right, now, Samuel,
when you lay her down

15:19.169 --> 15:21.296
in front of the fireplace,
I want you to enter from...

15:21.380 --> 15:22.714
Oh, my God!

15:22.798 --> 15:24.758
Uh, h-hey, you guys.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.134
Hey, Brian.
Can I be in the movie?

15:26.218 --> 15:28.637
Well, actually, one
of the Jacuzzi girls didn't show up.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.722
How long can you
hold your breath underwater, sweetie?

15:30.806 --> 15:32.724
Real long.
One time at Hatch Pond...

15:32.808 --> 15:34.142
No! Absolutely not.

15:34.226 --> 15:35.644
This is a closed set.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.271
You gotta leave.
Get these people out of here... now.

15:37.354 --> 15:40.065
Oh, what? Now that you're a big
director, we embarrass you?

15:40.148 --> 15:42.401
No! No, I-I mean, yes.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.236
Does anyone else
smell Astroglide?

15:46.572 --> 15:48.407
You're going to look
so handsome.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.367
Oh, look at these crow's feet.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.119
My God, you stay up
past 7:30

15:52.202 --> 15:54.413
and you pay for it
in the morning.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.915
Who the hell does Brian
think he is?

15:56.999 --> 15:58.792
Well, maybe he thought
we'd get in the way.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.502
I mean, it wouldn't be
the first time

16:00.586 --> 16:01.753
you've disrupted
a performance.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.138
Oh, geez! Oh, God!
Oh, God, I didn't see it.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.223
It jumped right out
in front of my car.

16:13.307 --> 16:15.350
Oh, I am so sorry.

16:15.434 --> 16:17.686
I think we just have
to face it, Peter.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.688
Brian's a big-time
Hollywood director

16:19.771 --> 16:21.857
and we're just simple,
small-town people.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.400
Uh... all right,
one more, one more.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.735
Rob Lowe.

16:24.818 --> 16:25.903
Straight.

16:25.986 --> 16:26.987
-No!
-Yes.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.155
Come... stop.
Ho-hum.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.573
Pull over.
Absolutely.

16:29.656 --> 16:30.782
Really?
Yep.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.117
Oh, well,
he hides it well.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.202
Yeah, he wishes.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.578
( applause )

16:34.661 --> 16:38.248
Stewie-- that's
a funny name-- Stewie.

16:38.332 --> 16:41.126
It's like Stew, only
with an "E" at the end.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.336
( audience laughs )

16:42.419 --> 16:43.670
Hmm.

16:43.754 --> 16:45.756
I meant it's funny, Stewie.

16:45.839 --> 16:50.093
See, I had an uncle named Stewie
and he used to sell bicycles.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.428
Look, I'm sorry.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.430
Aren't you supposed
to be asking me a question?

16:53.514 --> 16:56.141
Stewie, what do you think
candy is made out of?

16:56.225 --> 16:57.351
Sunshine and farts!

16:57.434 --> 16:59.770
What the hell kind
of question is that?

16:59.853 --> 17:03.565
I love candy!
When I was a little boy

17:03.649 --> 17:06.109
we would play stickball.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.529
No, no, I'll wait.

17:08.612 --> 17:09.988
Oh, are you finished?

17:10.072 --> 17:11.823
I'm sorry. You know,
it's my fault, really.

17:11.907 --> 17:14.117
I was under the impression
the name of the show was

17:14.201 --> 17:15.619
Kids Say
the Darndest Things

17:15.702 --> 17:17.955
not Old Black Comedians
Never Shut the Hell up.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.831
Ask me what I want to be
when I grow up.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.834
And we also used to play
brock-brock.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.502
Enough of your blather.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.962
Good evening, world.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.339
From this moment on,
I will be your...

17:27.422 --> 17:28.507
Ooh!

17:28.590 --> 17:30.634
( muttering and chortling )

17:30.717 --> 17:32.261
What you got there?

17:32.344 --> 17:34.304
Oh, you get to go
skiing now!

17:34.388 --> 17:35.848
Give... give that back
to me!

17:35.931 --> 17:37.182
They're of no use
to you!

17:37.266 --> 17:39.309
Oh, I'm going down
the mountain.

17:39.393 --> 17:40.811
Goo-goo-ga-choo!

17:40.894 --> 17:41.979
( all laughing )

17:42.062 --> 17:44.314
No! Don't listen to him!

17:44.398 --> 17:45.899
That's not funny!

17:45.983 --> 17:48.986
That's just saying what happens
when you go skiing!!

17:49.069 --> 17:50.279
Ah!

17:50.362 --> 17:51.780
Here I go, down
the slope.

17:51.864 --> 17:53.907
Oh, I'm going zip-zop-
zoopedy-bop!

17:55.492 --> 17:57.411
Stop it! Stop applauding him!

17:57.494 --> 18:00.122
He's not even using
real words anymore!

18:00.205 --> 18:03.166
We'll be back with
a little girl from Atlanta

18:03.250 --> 18:06.003
who skips rope
with here sister's pigtails!

18:06.086 --> 18:07.421
( muttering nonsense syllables)

18:07.504 --> 18:09.089
No! my segment's not over!

18:09.173 --> 18:10.424
Come on, little fellow.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.676
You like to jump rope,
don't you?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.262
( robotic, child-like voice :
I like jump rope.

18:15.345 --> 18:19.266
All right, so you gonna
just sit here and enjoy it.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.810
I'm going to sit here
and enjoy it

18:21.894 --> 18:23.395
and I like pudding

18:23.478 --> 18:26.565
and Ghost Dad was the best
movie I've seen

18:26.648 --> 18:28.400
since Leonard Part VI.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.944
( audience applauds )

18:31.028 --> 18:33.238
Good news, good news!

18:33.322 --> 18:34.740
What, more people I love

18:34.823 --> 18:36.241
think I'm
an arrogant jerk?

18:36.325 --> 18:37.492
You're more than that

18:37.576 --> 18:39.161
Mr. Nominated-for-an-adult
movie-award

18:39.244 --> 18:40.370
for-Best-New-Director.

18:40.454 --> 18:42.289
A Woody? I'm up for a Woody?

18:42.372 --> 18:43.582
Come on! Call your family!

18:43.665 --> 18:45.709
I'll bet they'll be
really proud of you.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.504
No. I'd rather they think
I'm a jerk than a smut peddler.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.380
Brian, they're your family.

18:50.464 --> 18:53.008
They'll love you even if you
made a couple of crappy movies.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.385
I mean, Blythe Danner still
loves Gwyneth Paltrow.

18:55.469 --> 18:56.720
Ooh! Score one for me.

19:00.349 --> 19:03.769
Welcome back to E!'s
Adult Video Awards preshow.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.063
It's a good crowd
here tonight, Mom.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.814
It sure is, Melissa.

19:07.898 --> 19:10.526
All the studs and sluts
are arriving.

19:10.609 --> 19:12.319
Brian! Brian!

19:12.402 --> 19:13.403
Uh, hey.

19:13.654 --> 19:16.240
You're nominated for three
of the seven films

19:16.323 --> 19:17.824
you directed yesterday--

19:17.908 --> 19:20.827
Add Mama to the Train,
The Purple Head of Cairo

19:20.911 --> 19:22.913
and, uh... what was
the third one?

19:22.996 --> 19:25.332
Uh, You've Got
Male Genitalia.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.876
You know, I was asked
to star in a porno once

19:27.960 --> 19:30.754
but I couldn't because,
you know, most of my body

19:30.838 --> 19:32.214
is less than 18 years old.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.674
( wheezing chuckle )

19:33.757 --> 19:36.510
I used to guest-host
the Tonight Show.

19:36.593 --> 19:39.137
Oh, yeah. What was that,
like 30 years ago?

19:39.221 --> 19:41.431
Your mic isn't plugged in.

19:41.515 --> 19:45.018
You're... you're not
even on television right now, are you?

19:45.102 --> 19:46.395
In my mind...

19:46.478 --> 19:48.355
( sobs theatrically )

19:48.438 --> 19:51.733
The next award is for best
original score in an adult film

19:51.817 --> 19:54.361
and the nominees
are Rod Jones...

19:54.444 --> 19:59.032
( sultry jazz playing )

19:59.116 --> 20:00.367
Walter Murphy...

20:00.450 --> 20:05.080
( identical song playing)

20:05.163 --> 20:06.707
...and John Williams.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.667
( dramatic theme playing)

20:13.505 --> 20:14.506
Lois:
Well, you've come a long way

20:14.590 --> 20:16.842
from hiding from
the vacuum cleaner.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.385
Lois!

20:18.468 --> 20:21.513
Hey, buddy. Hey, how are you,
Alfred Hitchcock... eh? Eh?

20:21.597 --> 20:23.140
You like that one,
Dick Hurtz?

20:23.223 --> 20:25.142
Ah, I'm sorry.
I'm already drunk.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.561
H-how did you guys know... I...?

20:27.644 --> 20:30.731
Jasper called.
Brian, why didn't you tell us?

20:30.814 --> 20:32.357
I thought you'd be
ashamed of me.

20:32.441 --> 20:34.193
Oh, are you kidding?
I ought to knock you out

20:34.276 --> 20:35.611
for not bringing
me here sooner.

20:35.694 --> 20:36.945
Look at the pair
on that one, Lois.

20:37.029 --> 20:38.155
Bigger than your head.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.157
So you guys aren't offended
by this?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.950
Well, I can't say
I approve, but...

20:42.034 --> 20:43.535
we love you.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.579
If this is what
makes you happy

20:45.662 --> 20:46.955
we support you.

20:47.039 --> 20:50.209
My God. I-I thought I needed
to get away from you guys

20:50.292 --> 20:52.669
to find what was missing
in my life, but...

20:52.753 --> 20:55.297
the only thing I'm missing
is my family.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.424
How could I ever have
become involved

20:57.508 --> 20:59.593
in this filthy,
degrading business?!

20:59.676 --> 21:02.763
M.C.:
And the award goes to... Brian Griffin.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.431
Whoo!

21:09.603 --> 21:10.896
Whoo!

21:10.979 --> 21:13.148
Oh-ho! Wow! My God!

21:13.232 --> 21:16.777
This is unexpected.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.737
I want to thank my incredible
production team

21:18.820 --> 21:20.948
who have been me from
Shaving Private Ryan

21:21.031 --> 21:22.658
all the way to
Welcome to my Face...

21:22.741 --> 21:25.661
He lives with us
back in Quahog.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.871
You got a nice wiggle,
baby.

21:27.955 --> 21:29.373
You want to be
in a movie? Huh?

21:29.456 --> 21:30.916
Little girl-girl
action, maybe?

21:30.999 --> 21:32.751
Ah! Peter!

21:32.835 --> 21:34.002
Good luck, buddy.

21:34.086 --> 21:36.672
I've been barking
up that tree for 17 years.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.009
Wow, that was
a wonderful trip

21:41.093 --> 21:43.637
and everyone has something
to remember it by.

21:46.932 --> 21:49.518
You're going to love it
at our house, Janet Jameison.

21:49.601 --> 21:52.020
( muffled muttering )
