00:40.290 --> 00:42.040
Jennifer, stay there!

00:51.300 --> 00:53.048
He's coming!

00:53.050 --> 00:53.800
Run!

01:20.830 --> 01:21.828
Dad?

01:21.830 --> 01:23.078
It might be her.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.828
Layla darlin', thank God.

01:24.830 --> 01:25.578
Come over here, love.

01:25.580 --> 01:26.580
Come on.

01:28.330 --> 01:29.330
That's not your Dad.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.838
Matt, it's me.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.090
You know me, you've
known me your whole life.

01:35.090 --> 01:35.840
Run!

01:37.340 --> 01:38.088
Listen to me!

01:38.090 --> 01:39.598
Make a circle with the sugar,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.098
and then you say the prayer.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.848
Do you hear me?

01:42.850 --> 01:44.098
Now go!

01:44.100 --> 01:45.598
Please, take me.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.098
She is just innocent!

01:47.100 --> 01:48.348
I accept.

01:48.350 --> 01:49.858
No, Mom, please no!

01:49.860 --> 01:51.358
Jennifer!

01:51.360 --> 01:53.858
Jennifer, you're so brave.

01:53.860 --> 01:54.610
Look at me.

01:55.860 --> 01:57.608
Stay strong.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.638
Tear out thy heart,
but keep safe thy tooth.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.138
Above thy grave and
below thy rooth.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.898
Tear out thy heart, but
keep safe thy tooth.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.148
Above thy grave and
below thy rooth,

02:34.150 --> 02:36.898
tear out my heart but
keep safe my tooth.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.148
Above thy grave and
below thy rooth,

02:39.150 --> 02:42.408
tear out my heart and
keep safe my tooth.

02:42.410 --> 02:44.658
Above thy grave and
below thy rooth,

02:44.660 --> 02:48.158
tear out my heart and
keep safe my tooth.

03:48.470 --> 03:50.730
Your back door was open.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.480
Father, would
you like a drink?

03:57.480 --> 03:58.478
I'm okay.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.230
Thank you.

04:01.490 --> 04:03.990
I saw Joe in town the other day.

04:05.740 --> 04:10.000
He wanted me to tell you
he was thinking of ya.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.000
I look in on Lane
almost every day.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.010
She has a beautiful spot.

04:23.760 --> 04:28.760
The sunshine shines
down on her perfectly.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.768
Have you got
something you want?

04:35.770 --> 04:37.020
'Cause I've got a lot to do.

04:39.270 --> 04:41.030
I'm always here for you, Jen.

04:44.530 --> 04:45.530
If you want to talk.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.778
Talk?

04:48.780 --> 04:50.540
You want me to talk?

04:55.290 --> 04:57.290
You're not well, Jen.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.798
You need...

04:59.800 --> 05:02.050
I need you to leave my house.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.300
Jen, you can't stay
cooped up in here.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.060
Please.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.558
You can't deal
with this alone.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.310
I just need you
to leave my house.

05:28.070 --> 05:30.080
You know where I am.

07:24.190 --> 07:25.938
Ew, Aunt Carla.

07:25.940 --> 07:27.938
It's only horse poo, Corey.

07:27.940 --> 07:30.448
Try just breathing
through your mouth.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.700
Is Nan a farmer?

07:32.950 --> 07:34.698
She used to be.

07:34.700 --> 07:35.950
Can I be a farmer?

07:37.450 --> 07:39.960
Well, you'd have to get used
to the smell, wouldn't you?

07:41.210 --> 07:42.208
Come on then.

07:42.210 --> 07:43.960
Let's go and say hello to Nanny.

07:45.460 --> 07:46.460
You bringing Teddy?

08:01.980 --> 08:02.730
Hello.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.980
And who's this big fella?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.498
How was your drive?

08:21.500 --> 08:22.748
Fine.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.758
How was the traffic?

08:32.760 --> 08:33.760
Fine.

08:39.510 --> 08:41.270
He's a big fellow
now, isn't he?

08:46.270 --> 08:47.768
Why don't you sit over here?

08:47.770 --> 08:49.018
With us.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.278
I'm all right here, thanks.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.280
Do you have it?

08:54.280 --> 08:55.778
Carla.

08:55.780 --> 08:56.780
What?

08:58.530 --> 08:59.528
Thank you for coming.

08:59.530 --> 09:01.540
You don't know how
much this means to me.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.038
Corey, why don't you get
yourself a little snack

09:06.040 --> 09:07.038
out in the kitchen?

09:07.040 --> 09:08.288
Yeah, go on.

09:08.290 --> 09:10.548
There's chocolate
biscuits in the tin

09:10.550 --> 09:12.050
next to the washing machine.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.058
Right, let's get
this straight, okay.

09:22.060 --> 09:24.808
I am here for Corey's
birth certificate.

09:24.810 --> 09:26.308
Nothing else.

09:26.310 --> 09:27.558
We're not okay, you and me.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.560
I'm not here to
play happy families.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.320
I never wanted it like this.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.568
You sent us away.

09:35.570 --> 09:36.818
I had no choice.

09:36.820 --> 09:38.568
If you just let me explain.

09:38.570 --> 09:39.568
No.

09:39.570 --> 09:41.828
No, you don't get to explain.

09:41.830 --> 09:43.328
You sent us away

09:43.330 --> 09:45.828
and you never even
bothered to tell us why.

09:45.830 --> 09:47.828
I couldn't tell you why.

09:47.830 --> 09:50.588
Because you're an
alcoholic, Mum, that's why.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.590
And me and Lane,

09:52.590 --> 09:54.588
God, we hated you.

09:54.590 --> 09:56.840
We hated you for years.

09:58.090 --> 10:00.098
And then like an idiot

10:00.100 --> 10:02.098
she just comes back here one day

10:02.100 --> 10:06.098
and lets you worm your
way into her stupid head.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.600
Don't you dare talk about
your sister like that!

10:11.610 --> 10:13.110
What about Mom?

10:14.110 --> 10:15.610
Corey, come here.

10:18.610 --> 10:19.858
You're both in danger, Carla.

10:19.860 --> 10:21.370
You's need to listen to me.

10:22.870 --> 10:25.618
Corey is gonna turn
10 in three days time,

10:25.620 --> 10:29.118
and I need you to be
ready for what's to come.

10:29.120 --> 10:29.868
What are you talking about?

10:29.870 --> 10:31.128
Nothing is coming for him.

10:31.130 --> 10:35.380
Above thy grave
and below thy rooth,

10:36.630 --> 10:40.888
tear out thy heart but
keep safe thy tooth.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.640
Stop it, you
will frighten him.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.390
Out there in that
earth under that barn

10:50.150 --> 10:51.898
there's something
our family is tied to

10:51.900 --> 10:54.898
and we need to be ready
for it when it comes.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.648
Have you heard yourself?

10:56.650 --> 10:58.148
I'm dying, Carla.

10:58.150 --> 11:00.658
I'm dying and I don't know
how long I've got left.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.408
And you need to listen to me

11:01.410 --> 11:02.658
'cause I can't bear the thought

11:02.660 --> 11:04.658
of something happening
to you and Corey.

11:04.660 --> 11:07.158
You need to understand
what we're tied to.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.158
Corey, come on.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.408
Let's get your stuff.

11:09.410 --> 11:10.918
Your grandmother
Annabelle died

11:10.920 --> 11:12.918
right in front of my eyes,

11:12.920 --> 11:16.918
and I will be damned if I let
you and Corey walk out here

11:16.920 --> 11:18.920
without you knowing
what's coming for you.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.678
Look, Carla, will
you just listen to me

11:22.680 --> 11:24.178
for goodness sake.

11:24.180 --> 11:27.178
I mean, you're not exactly
the perfect sister, are you?

11:27.180 --> 11:29.178
You slept with your
sister's boyfriend

11:29.180 --> 11:30.938
while she was pregnant.

11:30.940 --> 11:31.938
Oh my God.

11:31.940 --> 11:33.688
Is that what she told you?

11:33.690 --> 11:35.688
You haven't got
a clue, have you?

11:35.690 --> 11:38.188
Look, I don't want
you in Corey's life.

11:38.190 --> 11:41.198
I don't want you to have
anything to do with him.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.448
You sent us away,

11:42.450 --> 11:45.198
and now look, you have
to be all on your own.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.950
See how well that tastes.

11:52.460 --> 11:53.458
Hello, Joe.

11:53.460 --> 11:54.460
Look who's here.

11:55.460 --> 11:57.208
Hey.

11:57.210 --> 11:57.960
Hey.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.220
Hey, little man.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.468
Come on, don't be shy.

12:07.470 --> 12:08.218
It's me.

12:08.220 --> 12:09.468
Say hello.

12:09.470 --> 12:10.478
Hi.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.230
Hi back.

12:12.730 --> 12:14.478
Carla was just leaving.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.480
Leavin'?

12:16.980 --> 12:18.978
But you've only just arrived.

12:18.980 --> 12:20.490
I can speak for
myself, thanks.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.488
I just popped in to get
his birth certificate,

12:23.490 --> 12:25.238
but you know what
it's like around here.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.490
Nothing's ever that simple.

12:27.740 --> 12:30.498
But it was nice to
see you anyway, Joe.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.250
Mum.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.000
Come on.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.248
Haven't seen you for years.

12:36.250 --> 12:39.498
Me and Corey will go and
find the birth certificate,

12:39.500 --> 12:40.758
we'll try our best.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.508
Why don't you guys go
out for a little walk.

12:43.510 --> 12:46.008
Hopefully it will be found
by the time you get back.

12:46.010 --> 12:47.008
Okay?

12:47.010 --> 12:48.258
I'll be about 10 minutes.

12:48.260 --> 12:49.260
All right, fine.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.520
Go on then.

12:56.270 --> 12:57.770
See you in a bit.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.290
Ah, chickens.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.298
I bet you missed this
place, haven't you?

13:23.300 --> 13:24.300
No, not really.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.798
Craig said he saw
you the other day.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.550
At the garage.

13:29.550 --> 13:30.308
Thought you were seeing things.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.558
Oh my God, Craig.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.810
How the hell is he?

13:35.060 --> 13:35.810
Craig.

13:39.310 --> 13:40.320
Fat.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.568
Really, really fat.

13:44.820 --> 13:45.570
Good.

13:47.070 --> 13:49.068
You always said
you'd never come back.

13:49.070 --> 13:51.580
Yeah, well, things change.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.090
I'm really sorry, Carla.

14:04.840 --> 14:05.590
About Lane.

14:14.850 --> 14:15.600
How's your Mum?

14:16.850 --> 14:18.348
Die.

14:18.350 --> 14:19.598
Jesus.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.608
Don't feel sorry for her, Joe.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.358
I'm not, it's just you know.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.358
I mean you guys
aren't exactly...

14:25.360 --> 14:28.108
What best mates like you
and her are though, eh?

14:28.110 --> 14:29.358
Very cozy.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.868
I've done a few odd
jobs around the house

14:30.870 --> 14:32.118
when Lane got ill.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.368
That doesn't exactly
make us best mates.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.620
Oh my God, what's that?

14:40.120 --> 14:41.378
What is she doing?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.880
I mean this place is rank.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.128
It's just falling
apart, it's horrible.

15:03.150 --> 15:03.900
Matt.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.398
Layla.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.400
Hi.

15:10.660 --> 15:11.410
You okay?

15:12.660 --> 15:13.410
How are you?

15:14.910 --> 15:15.908
Great.

15:15.910 --> 15:16.910
Thank you.

15:18.910 --> 15:20.160
Didn't know you were back.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.918
No, well, I'm not.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.920
I'm just popping in.

15:27.420 --> 15:30.680
I'm so sorry to hear about Mora.

15:32.180 --> 15:32.930
My condolences.

15:35.430 --> 15:36.430
Thank you.

15:38.430 --> 15:40.178
Your Mom inside the house?

15:40.180 --> 15:41.940
Yeah, yeah, she's in.

15:44.690 --> 15:45.688
Layla.

15:45.690 --> 15:46.690
I'm good.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.698
That was awkward.

15:57.700 --> 15:58.948
You think?

15:58.950 --> 16:01.458
He's been coming there
every day and to church

16:01.460 --> 16:02.958
since it happened.

16:02.960 --> 16:03.958
What?

16:03.960 --> 16:04.708
Really?

16:04.710 --> 16:05.958
Yeah.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.208
That's strange.

16:07.210 --> 16:09.460
Well, I suppose he hasn't
really got much family, has he?

16:16.720 --> 16:18.218
I'm not trying to
patronize you, Jen.

16:18.220 --> 16:19.718
I just don't think you've
got anything to worry about.

16:19.720 --> 16:20.978
She's locked away.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.228
She won't rise again

16:22.230 --> 16:24.228
as long as we protect
this land, remember?

16:24.230 --> 16:25.478
Jen, it's done.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.478
It's over, it ended
when we were kids.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.228
Look, you are not
listening to me.

16:30.230 --> 16:33.238
There are going to be 10
soon and they are in danger.

16:33.240 --> 16:33.988
I don't have time
for this, okay.

16:33.990 --> 16:35.238
I have got to get going.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.988
Layla.

16:36.990 --> 16:38.738
What is the point of
running around in the past?

16:38.740 --> 16:40.498
I don't wanna think about this,

16:40.500 --> 16:41.748
let alone talk about it.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.248
Okay, it's done and
it's over like I said.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.498
Like Matt said.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.250
She is not gonna rise again.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.760
Just don't worry
about it, okay.

17:05.770 --> 17:07.018
What?

17:07.770 --> 17:08.268
Satisfied.

17:08.270 --> 17:09.518
Yeah...

17:23.790 --> 17:26.290
God, I've forgotten
how pretty it was.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.548
So, still in need of a flat?

17:33.550 --> 17:36.800
Yeah, I'll move out
when I can afford it.

17:38.550 --> 17:39.298
Listen, if you
need more money,

17:39.300 --> 17:40.550
I can always send more.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.808
No, I don't need charity.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.308
Thanks.

17:43.310 --> 17:44.808
It's not charity.

17:44.810 --> 17:45.810
I'm his Dad.

17:47.810 --> 17:50.568
Even though you wouldn't
thinking that looking at him.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.570
I mean, he doesn't
even know who I am.

17:55.820 --> 17:57.318
Obviously he doesn't
look anything like me,

17:57.320 --> 18:00.570
but he doesn't even
remember that I raised him

18:00.580 --> 18:03.578
for the first five
years of his life.

18:03.580 --> 18:06.328
I promised his Mom that
I would support him,

18:06.330 --> 18:07.580
right before she died.

18:08.830 --> 18:09.828
He does know who you are,

18:09.830 --> 18:10.840
he's just shy.

18:12.340 --> 18:16.088
And this whole situation
is really strange for him.

18:16.090 --> 18:17.838
Yeah, well it
doesn't have to be.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.840
I don't have to be a stranger.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.348
Look, we've been through
this so many times.

18:23.350 --> 18:26.348
You can't leave here because
of your Dad's business,

18:26.350 --> 18:27.598
and there's not a hope in hell

18:27.600 --> 18:29.100
of me moving back to this farm.

18:32.110 --> 18:35.358
Well, you're here now.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.108
That's what matters to me.

18:38.110 --> 18:39.360
So, you'll stay?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.118
Just for tonight.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.370
At least let me spend
some time with him.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.380
What the hell?

18:57.130 --> 18:59.880
Looks like your Mom's got
people living off her land.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.138
Excuse me.

19:05.140 --> 19:07.888
You need to leave,
this is private land.

19:07.890 --> 19:09.388
Yeah, man, you need to
get the hell out of here.

19:09.390 --> 19:10.640
Come on, let's go, get out.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.900
You got any sweets?

19:14.900 --> 19:16.648
You've got three seconds
before I remove you myself.

19:16.650 --> 19:17.900
Let's go, come on!

19:33.170 --> 19:34.668
I can't believe
he just spat at me.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.418
You all right?

19:36.420 --> 19:37.420
Ew.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.988
All right, mate, you
wanna get out of here?

20:46.990 --> 20:49.240
They'll call the cops on me.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
You hear me?

21:10.260 --> 21:14.518
You must
look after your teeth.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.270
My teeth are the
last of my worries.

21:18.520 --> 21:21.780
Maybe
I could help you.

21:25.030 --> 21:27.280
Fucking hell, did you
rob a bank or somethin'?

21:28.530 --> 21:33.290
- A
- tooth for our reward.

21:34.290 --> 21:35.788
What kind of
fetish have you got?

21:35.790 --> 21:36.788
What are you, the tooth fairy?

21:36.790 --> 21:39.538
Give me your tooth.

21:39.540 --> 21:41.300
You want a tooth for money?

21:45.550 --> 21:47.050
- How do we get 'em out?
- Easy.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.550
Sit down.

22:09.820 --> 22:10.830
Keep quiet.

22:12.580 --> 22:13.328
No, no no no no.

22:13.330 --> 22:14.328
I changed my mind.

22:14.330 --> 22:15.578
I changed, no.

22:15.580 --> 22:17.078
It
will hurt of course.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.328
No, no, no no, no.

22:19.330 --> 22:20.080
No, no.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.588
Two, three.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.100
No!

22:35.850 --> 22:36.598
No no!

22:36.600 --> 22:37.848
No no no, I changed my mind.

22:37.850 --> 22:38.850
No, please.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.108
No!

22:45.110 --> 22:46.608
No, no.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.130
You all right, Mum?

23:18.140 --> 23:20.390
Why haven't you told
me about this, Mum?

23:21.650 --> 23:23.150
It's an eviction notice.

23:25.900 --> 23:29.148
They've just been sending
those things for months.

23:29.150 --> 23:30.398
Vultures.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.660
They won't go anywhere.

23:34.410 --> 23:36.910
We've worked too hard
to keep this land.

23:37.660 --> 23:38.910
It belongs to us.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.918
It's our family's.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.418
Yeah, but it says here, Mum.

23:44.420 --> 23:49.418
You're supposed to
respond in 30 days,

23:49.420 --> 23:50.928
and this is dated
three months ago.

23:50.930 --> 23:55.178
You can't just ignore
stuff like this, Mum.

23:55.180 --> 23:56.928
I've got it under control.

23:56.930 --> 23:58.678
It's not under
control, is it, Mum?

23:58.680 --> 24:00.178
I mean look around you.

24:00.180 --> 24:01.940
This whole farm
is falling apart.

24:03.440 --> 24:07.188
I mean, Joe was telling me
that the drains are screwed,

24:07.190 --> 24:08.438
and have you seen the stables?

24:08.440 --> 24:11.698
They're just, the wood
is completely rotten.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.698
You don't tell me
how to work this farm.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.448
I've been doing it since
before you were born.

24:15.450 --> 24:18.198
Yeah, and you're
coping so well.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.950
Oh, you're just
like your father.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.960
Yeah, you don't get to talk
to me like that anymore, Mum.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.218
You know what I think?

24:34.220 --> 24:35.470
I think if we...

24:40.470 --> 24:44.480
If we fix this bit right there,

24:45.730 --> 24:46.728
we should be able
to get the water

24:46.730 --> 24:47.730
to drain off into here.

24:48.980 --> 24:49.980
Would you reckon?

24:52.740 --> 24:55.988
You know, when I
was about your age,

24:55.990 --> 24:58.488
my Dad used to bring
me up to his workshops.

24:58.490 --> 25:01.748
You know, just to watch the
lads work on the engines.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.248
Loved it.

25:03.250 --> 25:07.000
You know the smell, their
brains really workin'.

25:08.500 --> 25:11.008
Not like sittin' behind
a desk, you know,

25:11.010 --> 25:12.260
your mind going to rot.

25:13.510 --> 25:14.258
This was real work.

25:14.260 --> 25:15.760
Proper graftin'.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.768
Oh!

25:24.770 --> 25:25.520
What's wrong?

25:38.780 --> 25:40.278
No.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.318
There, that's me,

26:14.320 --> 26:16.070
and Matt and Layla
when it happened.

26:18.570 --> 26:21.828
I was 10 years old
when it came after me.

26:21.830 --> 26:25.080
I'm just concerned it
will go after Corey.

26:25.830 --> 26:27.328
What thing?

26:27.330 --> 26:29.330
Mother called it tooth.

26:31.090 --> 26:36.090
It can be or look like whatever
you think it looks like

26:36.840 --> 26:39.338
or want it to look like.

26:39.340 --> 26:42.848
Well, you're
clearly still mental.

26:42.850 --> 26:44.348
I'm sorry, Mum, I can't do this.

26:44.350 --> 26:45.598
I've gotta go.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.098
Carla, please.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.348
No, Mom, I can't.

26:48.350 --> 26:50.098
Seriously.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.858
What just happened?

26:53.860 --> 26:55.358
Power's out.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.110
But I thought you've
got a separate generator?

26:58.610 --> 27:00.860
Right, I need to
get Corey out of here.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.880
Corey, what happened?

27:13.630 --> 27:14.878
My tooth fell out.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.378
Oh.

27:16.380 --> 27:18.128
Carla, what's wrong?

27:18.130 --> 27:19.880
The generator's gone.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.388
We fixed the gutter.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.140
Did you?

27:24.140 --> 27:25.140
Look, the lights.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.638
What lights?

27:27.640 --> 27:28.888
Exactly.

27:28.890 --> 27:31.140
There aren't any
lights in sight.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.398
Why is this thing not working?

27:34.400 --> 27:36.150
No, wait, yours as well.

27:37.400 --> 27:41.408
I don't know how a power
cut could affect the phones.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.658
Listen, I'll tell you what.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.408
We'll head over to Matt's,
grab some supplies.

27:44.410 --> 27:45.908
Okay, he'll have a
look at the generator.

27:45.910 --> 27:47.660
The power will be
back on in no time.

27:48.910 --> 27:50.408
Jen, take him inside.

27:50.410 --> 27:51.668
Okay, thanks.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.418
All right, fine.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.170
We'll take my car.

27:54.170 --> 27:56.420
All right, let's go.

27:58.170 --> 27:59.168
What?

27:59.170 --> 28:00.418
Hang on.

28:00.420 --> 28:01.678
There's no electricity,

28:01.680 --> 28:03.928
but the one in the
stable's working.

28:03.930 --> 28:05.180
That's not creepy at all.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.948
Is your Mom havin'
a kid's party?

28:24.950 --> 28:26.198
I don't know.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.200
I guess it must be
that homeless man.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.458
Strange.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.460
Come on.

28:50.220 --> 28:52.980
Ah, what is wrong
with this thing.

28:53.980 --> 28:55.228
Do you want me to try?

28:55.230 --> 28:56.728
What difference
is that gonna make?

28:56.730 --> 28:57.480
What's wrong?

28:58.480 --> 28:59.980
Well, that's just the thing.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.240
Nothing at all.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.248
Well, what do we do now?

29:14.250 --> 29:15.750
I guess we walk.

29:17.500 --> 29:18.998
It's three miles.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.498
Four at most.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.508
Look, have you seen what
I'm wearing on my feet?

29:22.510 --> 29:24.258
There is no point in
you two traipsing off.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.008
That's far too far to walk.

29:26.010 --> 29:27.258
Joe, you can have the sofa.

29:27.260 --> 29:28.510
You can both stay, okay.

29:30.010 --> 29:30.760
All right, come on.

29:33.020 --> 29:33.770
Great.

29:34.770 --> 29:39.770
It's not that bad.

29:53.290 --> 29:54.040
You comfy?

29:56.290 --> 29:57.290
How's your tooth?

29:59.040 --> 30:00.290
Is it now better?

30:01.550 --> 30:03.548
Auntie Carla?

30:03.550 --> 30:04.548
Yes, darlin'?

30:04.550 --> 30:06.550
Why are you angry with Nana?

30:08.050 --> 30:10.298
I'm not angry, I'm just sad.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.308
Is it because of Mum?

30:12.310 --> 30:14.808
I wish you could have
spent more time with her.

30:14.810 --> 30:16.808
You would have loved her.

30:16.810 --> 30:18.310
Why do people die?

30:20.060 --> 30:21.310
All sorts of reasons.

30:21.320 --> 30:26.070
They get sick or sometimes
they get old or tired.

30:30.070 --> 30:32.830
I don't want to
be old, sad or sick.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.328
Well, I don't think you
have to worry about that

30:35.330 --> 30:36.328
for a long, long time.

30:36.330 --> 30:37.578
Promise?

30:37.580 --> 30:38.330
Promise.

30:39.580 --> 30:41.590
You should try
harder with Nan.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.588
She's sick.

30:44.590 --> 30:47.340
She isn't well and one
day you might regret it.

31:12.370 --> 31:15.120
Kind Jesus,
hear my prayer.

31:16.620 --> 31:20.368
Hide me within Your wounds
and keep me close to You.

31:20.370 --> 31:22.878
Defend me from the evil enemy

31:22.880 --> 31:26.128
and call me at the
hour of my death.

31:26.130 --> 31:28.378
To the fellowship of Your saints

31:28.380 --> 31:33.388
that I may sing thy praise
with them for all eternity.

31:33.390 --> 31:34.140
Amen.

31:54.410 --> 31:56.158
Have you done your chores?

31:56.160 --> 31:57.410
Yes, Father.

31:59.410 --> 32:01.418
And you've said
your Hail Mary's?

32:01.420 --> 32:03.170
All 10 of them, Father.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.170
To bed then.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.430
Good night, child.

32:28.690 --> 32:30.190
The Lord is my defender.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.950
Looks like things
are progressing.

32:36.450 --> 32:37.950
I'm not good at this stuff.

32:41.460 --> 32:46.460
Mora, Mora was always the
one for the affection.

32:48.210 --> 32:49.960
Mora is with you always.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.990
Is Shannon still
having restless night?

33:13.490 --> 33:14.240
Yeah.

33:20.490 --> 33:22.000
I'll check in on my way out.

33:55.530 --> 33:56.280
Hello.

34:02.790 --> 34:06.540
My child, do you
know why I'm here?

34:08.040 --> 34:09.040
No.

34:45.580 --> 34:46.330
Oh.

34:50.080 --> 34:50.830
My love.

34:56.590 --> 34:57.840
I miss you so much.

34:59.090 --> 35:00.840
I prayed and I prayed.

35:02.850 --> 35:04.100
Your prayers were heard.

35:09.850 --> 35:12.610
Do you love God, my child?

35:13.860 --> 35:14.860
I do, holy mother.

35:16.360 --> 35:19.360
Do you fear God, my child?

35:21.360 --> 35:22.868
I do, holy mother.

35:22.870 --> 35:23.870
You should.

35:27.370 --> 35:29.120
I want to be
good, holy mother.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.880
God's children
are all born bad.

35:38.130 --> 35:39.378
No.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.890
He sees everything you hide.

35:44.890 --> 35:46.140
Yes, holy mother.

35:47.890 --> 35:50.390
We must tear out
the wickedness.

35:52.150 --> 35:52.900
Holy mother.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.400
Come closer.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.158
Children's tongues are wicked

36:02.160 --> 36:04.160
and the teeth keep
the wickedness warm.

36:05.410 --> 36:07.160
Open your mouth, my child,

36:08.160 --> 36:10.160
and we shall purge you.

36:24.430 --> 36:27.678
You didn't bury
me deep enough.

37:23.240 --> 37:23.990
Shannon!

37:26.990 --> 37:27.740
Shannon!

39:03.340 --> 39:06.840
What the fuck,
there's no signal still?

39:56.890 --> 39:57.638
Oh God.

39:57.640 --> 39:58.638
Hey.

39:58.640 --> 39:59.888
You scared me.

39:59.890 --> 40:01.388
Sorry.

40:01.390 --> 40:02.898
I was just grabbing some water.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.900
Yeah, well, give me a
shout next time, yeah?

40:17.660 --> 40:18.410
I've missed you.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.920
I was a dick, I know.

40:25.170 --> 40:25.920
I'm sorry.

40:27.420 --> 40:32.430
I lived with Lane because
she was never you.

40:39.180 --> 40:40.430
It's kinda crazy, right?

40:42.440 --> 40:43.940
From when we were teenagers.

40:45.440 --> 40:46.940
I'd come through the backdoor.

40:49.190 --> 40:50.690
You telling me to be quiet.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.450
Yeah, but we're not
kids anymore, are we?

41:12.720 --> 41:17.720
Who says we can't
take it back now?

41:24.980 --> 41:28.230
Joe, you chose Lane.

41:36.740 --> 41:38.490
I always wanted you.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.750
Tell me you don't miss this.

42:58.570 --> 43:00.570
Joe, I'm sorry, but
that meant nothing.

43:05.580 --> 43:06.830
Guys, power's back on.

43:47.370 --> 43:48.618
Don't worry about it.

43:48.620 --> 43:49.620
Leave it, leave it,
it's fine, it's fine.

43:58.380 --> 43:59.128
What happened?

43:59.130 --> 44:01.128
Oh me.

44:01.130 --> 44:03.388
- Don't worry about it.
- What do you do?

44:03.390 --> 44:04.888
Put in some
breakfast, big man?

44:04.890 --> 44:05.888
Yeah?

44:05.890 --> 44:06.640
Come on.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.648
Power's back on then.

44:13.650 --> 44:17.148
Yeah, it's now let's
go check out the generator.

44:17.150 --> 44:18.650
And the fan's working to?

44:19.900 --> 44:22.150
Yeah, they all came
back on at the same time.

44:22.160 --> 44:26.658
What time was that?

44:26.660 --> 44:27.908
We hasn't been
laughing very long,

44:27.910 --> 44:31.160
so I'll say just before five.

44:35.420 --> 44:38.668
So if the phone's
working and the power's on

44:38.670 --> 44:40.918
then surely the
car will be fine.

44:40.920 --> 44:42.428
We're leaving.

44:42.430 --> 44:45.180
Oh, there's no rush.

44:46.680 --> 44:47.680
Come on, let's go.

44:58.690 --> 45:01.440
Can't be a good cup, huh?

45:02.200 --> 45:03.948
Old habits die hard.

45:03.950 --> 45:04.700
Excuse me?

45:06.200 --> 45:08.948
I'm rather partial to a cup
in the middle of the night,

45:08.950 --> 45:11.448
but the kitchen was preoccupied.

45:11.450 --> 45:13.210
What are you
trying to say, Mum?

45:16.710 --> 45:19.208
Well, you're already back
less than five minutes,

45:19.210 --> 45:21.458
and you're all over
him like a rash.

45:21.460 --> 45:23.968
Gosh, I'm surprised that you
didn't through your items

45:23.970 --> 45:25.218
and flog them online.

45:25.220 --> 45:26.718
Oh my God, that is enough.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.718
If you must know, I was
with Joe long before Lane

45:29.720 --> 45:32.228
even knew that he existed.

45:32.230 --> 45:36.228
And when they got together
I was absolutely devastated.

45:36.230 --> 45:38.478
But then she was
here living with you,

45:38.480 --> 45:39.728
and I knew I couldn't do that

45:39.730 --> 45:41.230
so I just left them to it.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.488
I just thought you like
to take what you want

45:44.490 --> 45:45.738
when you want, where you want.

45:45.740 --> 45:46.988
Oh my God!

45:46.990 --> 45:49.238
You just don't get
it, Mum, do you?

45:49.240 --> 45:51.738
You just don't understand!

45:51.740 --> 45:53.248
Did you know when
they first met,

45:53.250 --> 45:57.248
he was so drunk he actually
thought that Lane was me?

45:57.250 --> 45:58.498
But then the damage was done

45:58.500 --> 46:00.498
and we promised we'd
never tell her the truth

46:00.500 --> 46:02.508
because she was pregnant.

46:02.510 --> 46:05.760
And I could not
hurt her like that.

46:10.260 --> 46:12.520
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.778
Yeah.

46:23.780 --> 46:24.780
No, you didn't.

46:26.780 --> 46:29.528
And I suppose it's time we
just stop blaming each other,

46:29.530 --> 46:32.288
you know, and painting
the other one out

46:32.290 --> 46:34.290
to be the bad guy all the time.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.048
Hi, Pauline.

46:44.050 --> 46:45.298
Yeah.

46:45.300 --> 46:46.050
What?

46:47.050 --> 46:48.050
Ah, Jesus God.

46:51.050 --> 46:52.048
Where is he now?

46:52.050 --> 46:53.558
Is that what the
police have told him?

46:53.560 --> 46:54.560
What's happened?

46:55.560 --> 46:59.558
So, okay, right.

46:59.560 --> 47:02.820
So no sign of entry,
no sound, no nothing.

47:06.820 --> 47:07.570
What happened?

47:09.320 --> 47:10.570
Yeah, I understand.

47:13.330 --> 47:14.330
All right, take care.

47:19.580 --> 47:20.830
What's happened, Mum?

47:22.840 --> 47:24.338
Mum!

47:24.340 --> 47:26.338
Can you go and get
my coat, please Corey,

47:26.340 --> 47:27.340
from the bedroom?

47:31.590 --> 47:34.100
Shannon Robinson is dead.

47:36.100 --> 47:37.100
Matt's little girl?

47:39.100 --> 47:39.850
How?

47:41.350 --> 47:44.108
Somebody crept into her room
in the middle of the night

47:44.110 --> 47:46.358
and took out her teeth.

47:46.360 --> 47:47.360
Oh my God.

48:10.880 --> 48:11.880
She's back.

48:13.390 --> 48:15.140
Tooth is back.

48:16.390 --> 48:18.138
God, not this again.

48:18.140 --> 48:19.638
Please.

48:19.640 --> 48:20.640
Hang on, hang on.

48:21.890 --> 48:23.648
What the hell is tooth?

48:23.650 --> 48:25.400
Shannon Robinson is dead.

48:26.900 --> 48:30.400
Her father helped me put away
evil in the ground years ago.

48:32.660 --> 48:36.158
We've obviously failed and
it's come back to punish us.

48:36.160 --> 48:39.410
It's punishing the children
for the parents' sins.

48:40.910 --> 48:44.918
That night, as children,
it was me, Matt and Layla.

48:44.920 --> 48:46.418
We put Tooth away.

48:46.420 --> 48:48.918
Mum, can you hear yourself?

48:48.920 --> 48:50.418
February 1983.

48:50.420 --> 48:53.428
Me, Matt and Layla killed it.

48:53.430 --> 48:54.928
It killed four other people

48:54.930 --> 48:58.178
including Layla's
Dad, your grandmother.

48:58.180 --> 49:00.178
We cornered it in the barn

49:00.180 --> 49:01.928
and burned it to
the ground alive.

49:01.930 --> 49:03.938
And now it's come
back to punish us

49:03.940 --> 49:06.188
by hurting what
we love the most.

49:06.190 --> 49:07.190
Okay, so hang on.

49:08.440 --> 49:09.940
This thing killed Shannon,

49:11.190 --> 49:12.698
but it didn't hurt Matt.

49:12.700 --> 49:13.948
Oh God, Joe, please,

49:13.950 --> 49:15.448
don't tell me you believe this!

49:15.450 --> 49:16.700
Don't encourage her!

49:17.950 --> 49:19.450
If you wanna hurt someone,

49:20.700 --> 49:22.958
the place to hit
them the hardest

49:22.960 --> 49:24.210
is with their babies.

49:25.960 --> 49:28.710
Mum, nothing is gonna
happen to Corey, okay?

49:29.960 --> 49:34.218
Layla has an 11
year old son, Jacob.

49:34.220 --> 49:36.218
We just need to get
into the car now

49:36.220 --> 49:37.968
and go and warn them, okay?

49:37.970 --> 49:39.718
This is all in your head.

49:39.720 --> 49:42.218
You're creating
these delusions...

49:42.220 --> 49:45.230
Is it a delusion that
Shannon Robinson is dead?

49:46.730 --> 49:48.478
Look, Mum, I know that
you're in a lot of pain, yeah,

49:48.480 --> 49:49.978
and you're trying
to blame someone

49:49.980 --> 49:52.488
for what happened with
Lane and you're angry

49:52.490 --> 49:53.738
and you're trying to make sense

49:53.740 --> 49:55.738
where there just isn't any,

49:55.740 --> 49:58.488
but you're just not well, Mum.

49:58.490 --> 50:00.738
I am not crazy.

50:00.740 --> 50:01.490
Look at me.

50:02.500 --> 50:03.500
Look at me.

50:05.250 --> 50:06.248
I can get you help.

50:06.250 --> 50:08.498
We can get you help.

50:08.500 --> 50:10.250
There's nothing
you can do, okay.

50:11.500 --> 50:14.508
We did this, I did this.

50:14.510 --> 50:16.008
You didn't do anything.

50:16.010 --> 50:19.508
It starts and
ends with me, okay.

50:19.510 --> 50:22.020
This thing is tied
to our family.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.270
She made a deal.

50:25.270 --> 50:26.020
Who?

50:27.520 --> 50:30.518
With my great
grandmother, Ivy.

50:30.520 --> 50:32.268
She started this.

50:32.270 --> 50:34.028
We were being run off our land

50:34.030 --> 50:36.278
and the children were starving
and she was desperate,

50:36.280 --> 50:38.278
so she made a pact.

50:38.280 --> 50:41.030
She reached right in
to the pit of the devil

50:42.280 --> 50:45.290
and came to a bargain
with a she witch.

50:46.790 --> 50:49.540
What the land enriches for
the head of a first born.

50:50.790 --> 50:52.550
She never, ever
kept the promised

50:53.800 --> 50:55.548
and give the head
of the first born.

50:55.550 --> 50:58.548
But she kept on
running from the devil,

50:58.550 --> 51:01.300
and because of that it placed
a curse on her bloodline.

51:04.060 --> 51:06.808
So it comes back
every generation.

51:06.810 --> 51:08.308
It got me when I
was 10 years old

51:08.310 --> 51:10.310
and just ripped my life apart.

51:11.560 --> 51:16.068
That's why, that's why
when you were nine,

51:16.070 --> 51:18.818
I'd call your father to
send you and Lane away.

51:18.820 --> 51:22.578
You just, I couldn't risk ya,
I didn't want you to be hurt.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.580
I had no choice, I'm sorry I
just had to have you sent away.

51:27.330 --> 51:29.828
I tried to tell Lane,
then she got sick

51:29.830 --> 51:30.830
and there was no time.

51:32.840 --> 51:35.340
I'm sorry, so sorry.

51:43.600 --> 51:44.598
It's all right, Mum.

51:44.600 --> 51:46.098
I'm really sorry.

51:46.100 --> 51:47.350
It's all right.

51:54.110 --> 51:55.358
She slept all day.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.858
Do you think I should wake her?

51:56.860 --> 51:58.858
No, I'd leave her.

51:58.860 --> 52:00.858
She must be exhausted.

52:00.860 --> 52:02.618
I spoke with Dr. Randall,

52:02.620 --> 52:04.368
but he's on house calls all day.

52:04.370 --> 52:06.368
He'll drop off over
at some point tonight.

52:06.370 --> 52:07.870
Oh, and Father Ruben too.

52:09.370 --> 52:12.118
Oh, did you hear
about Matt yet?

52:12.120 --> 52:14.378
He hasn't been
charged or anything.

52:14.380 --> 52:16.130
Police are still
questioning him.

52:17.380 --> 52:19.630
I just can't take
any of this in.

52:21.130 --> 52:22.130
Do you believe her?

52:24.140 --> 52:27.138
I believe that
she believes it.

52:27.140 --> 52:29.138
It's just whenever
I used to ring Lane,

52:29.140 --> 52:31.140
she'd just say
that Mom was fine.

52:32.650 --> 52:35.400
I guess we were never that
honest with each other though.

52:36.650 --> 52:37.400
Yeah.

52:38.900 --> 52:41.150
Seems to be a habit with
the women in your family.

53:12.940 --> 53:14.438
Who hasn't heard
of the toothfairy?

53:14.440 --> 53:16.688
When you're a kid it's as
well known as Santa Claus

53:16.690 --> 53:17.688
or the Easter bunny,

53:17.690 --> 53:19.188
and everyone knows the drill.

53:19.190 --> 53:21.438
Your tooth falls out, you
put it under your pillow,

53:21.440 --> 53:22.690
when you wake up in the morning

53:22.700 --> 53:24.198
you're in the money.

53:24.200 --> 53:26.198
But when does she come from?

53:26.200 --> 53:28.698
Well, believe it or not,
her origins are far darker

53:28.700 --> 53:30.948
than the fairytale would
lead you to believe.

53:30.950 --> 53:32.708
It actually begins
in the 17th Century

53:32.710 --> 53:34.708
with a witch named Befana,

53:34.710 --> 53:37.958
who legend tells would
offer up coins to children

53:37.960 --> 53:39.958
exchanged for their teeth.

53:39.960 --> 53:42.968
But get this, a tooth
was actually considered

53:42.970 --> 53:45.218
an invitation to the devil,

53:45.220 --> 53:47.718
and local legend says
that the only way

53:47.720 --> 53:50.468
to keep her at bay
was with sugar.

53:50.470 --> 53:53.728
So you want to keep her at bay
as well as purify the earth,

53:53.730 --> 53:56.728
you better have sugar handy
because you're not gonna get by

53:56.730 --> 53:58.478
by just being sweet.

53:58.480 --> 54:01.228
You need sugar to
keep yourself safe.

54:01.230 --> 54:02.988
At least that's what I've
heard, that's what I've read

54:02.990 --> 54:05.988
is for some reason
sugar will keep you safe

54:05.990 --> 54:07.488
from the toothfairy,
from Befana.

54:07.490 --> 54:08.988
I have no idea why,

54:08.990 --> 54:10.238
but that's what they say.

54:54.290 --> 54:56.290
Oh God, I hate these things.

54:57.040 --> 54:58.040
Can you hear me?

54:59.290 --> 55:01.288
What a stupid question
to ask a machine.

55:01.290 --> 55:04.548
Yeah, okay, I know I don't
look great, all right.

55:04.550 --> 55:07.048
I've been waitin' for a good
hair day for about a week

55:07.050 --> 55:09.050
and I just don't think
it's gonna happen.

55:10.050 --> 55:11.050
Hello Carla.

55:13.810 --> 55:15.558
Look, if you're watching this

55:15.560 --> 55:18.060
then I guess you know,

55:21.310 --> 55:25.818
and also if you're watching
this it means that you're home

55:25.820 --> 55:27.568
and I always said
that I'd get you

55:27.570 --> 55:29.568
home in the end, didn't I?

55:29.570 --> 55:31.320
I hope you and Corey are okay.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.830
Oh God, he must be nine now.

55:37.080 --> 55:39.580
It's crazy how fast
time flies, isn't it?

55:41.830 --> 55:44.588
Look, we have this
habit in our family

55:44.590 --> 55:47.088
of never telling each
other exactly how we feel,

55:47.090 --> 55:50.338
so that's why I'm doin' this.

55:50.340 --> 55:54.598
Firstly, I want you to know
that I love you, Carla.

55:54.600 --> 55:57.348
I do, I mean you're messy

55:57.350 --> 55:59.348
and you're moody as
hell in the mornings,

55:59.350 --> 56:01.850
but oh my God I love you,

56:03.110 --> 56:07.860
and I know that we had a
really crap, crap childhood.

56:09.110 --> 56:10.358
We really did, and you're
still angry about that

56:10.360 --> 56:13.618
and you've got
every right to be,

56:13.620 --> 56:15.120
but do you know what?

56:16.370 --> 56:18.368
When someone tells
you that you're dying,

56:18.370 --> 56:21.368
you just get this clarity

56:21.370 --> 56:24.378
about what's important
in your life.

56:24.380 --> 56:27.878
I mean, I didn't even
know what sepsis was

56:27.880 --> 56:29.880
until someone told me I had it.

56:32.130 --> 56:35.138
But I need you to do
something for me, okay.

56:35.140 --> 56:38.638
I need you to just move on.

56:38.640 --> 56:41.140
I need you to let
it go and move on,

56:42.640 --> 56:45.898
and, you know, I came back
here and I lived with Mum

56:45.900 --> 56:48.398
when I was pregnant, because,

56:48.400 --> 56:52.908
I mean I was broken
and then I met Joe

56:52.910 --> 56:55.408
and he gave me
everything that I needed,

56:55.410 --> 56:57.160
and then when you came to visit.

56:58.160 --> 57:00.158
Oh God, you're in
such a bad place

57:00.160 --> 57:02.670
and it just brought up
all that stuff for you

57:03.920 --> 57:05.918
and I just want you to
know that I forgive you

57:05.920 --> 57:08.420
for what happened
with Joe, I really do.

57:09.920 --> 57:12.418
But you need to forgive Mom.

57:12.420 --> 57:15.428
Please, if that's all
I can ask you to do,

57:15.430 --> 57:18.178
just forgive her because
she's all you've got.

57:18.180 --> 57:20.678
I mean, I know she's
crap, she's really crap,

57:20.680 --> 57:24.188
but you know you
can't change the past

57:24.190 --> 57:25.940
but you can change your future.

57:27.190 --> 57:29.190
Oh crap, I sound
like a crap boy band.

57:30.940 --> 57:35.448
Look, just please,
just build a future

57:35.450 --> 57:40.200
and know that I'm here
and I'm watching you

57:41.450 --> 57:42.700
and I'm smiling down on you

57:43.960 --> 57:46.210
and I love you, okay.

57:47.210 --> 57:48.208
I do.

57:48.210 --> 57:49.210
I love you!

57:50.710 --> 57:53.470
If your hand is not up my
this screen I'll be fuming.

58:28.500 --> 58:30.498
Jennifer, I need
to talk to you now!

58:34.260 --> 58:35.508
Jennifer!

58:35.510 --> 58:38.258
Jennifer, I need to
speak to you now!

58:38.260 --> 58:39.508
Where is she?

58:39.510 --> 58:40.508
Matt, you need to
calm down first, okay.

58:40.510 --> 58:41.758
She's sleeping.

58:41.760 --> 58:42.508
I don't care if
she's sleeping.

58:42.510 --> 58:43.518
Get her down her now!

58:43.520 --> 58:45.268
- Matt!
- Ger her down here now.

58:45.270 --> 58:47.268
Matt, Matt Matt,
it's okay, okay.

58:47.270 --> 58:48.020
It's just Joe.

58:50.520 --> 58:52.020
Do you know what they think?

58:53.030 --> 58:55.528
Do you know what
the police think?

58:55.530 --> 58:58.280
My little girl, they
think I killed her.

58:59.530 --> 59:02.278
They think I smashed
her teeth out.

59:02.280 --> 59:03.788
My little girl!

59:03.790 --> 59:05.788
Matt, I'm so sorry.

59:05.790 --> 59:08.288
You did this.

59:08.290 --> 59:12.038
You and your family,
there's evil here.

59:12.040 --> 59:13.050
Stinks of it.

59:14.550 --> 59:16.798
You will pay for this.

59:16.800 --> 59:21.048
You and your family will
pay for this in this life

59:21.050 --> 59:22.300
or the next.

59:23.060 --> 59:24.558
We had to stop this.

59:24.560 --> 59:27.058
You think you can
keep your grandson safe?

59:27.060 --> 59:28.308
He's dead.

59:28.310 --> 59:29.558
You're all dead.

59:29.560 --> 59:30.308
All right, that's
enough, Matt!

59:30.310 --> 59:31.308
It was all of us.

59:31.310 --> 59:33.318
It was you, me and Layla.

59:33.320 --> 59:34.568
We were children.

59:34.570 --> 59:36.568
It won't stop,
we have to stop it.

59:36.570 --> 59:40.068
Otherwise other children
will suffer Shannon's fate.

59:40.070 --> 59:43.330
You do not mention her name.

59:44.830 --> 59:47.580
You have taken my
family from me.

59:51.830 --> 59:54.840
You do not get to desecrate
her memory as well.

59:56.590 --> 59:57.588
Matt, wait.

59:57.590 --> 59:58.340
Matt!

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.590
Leave him, let him go.

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:07.348
We just need to, I don't know.

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:09.098
We need to get Layla.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.850
Jen, you okay?

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:13.100
Jen.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:13.860
Jen, you okay?

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.120
Layla.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:34.630
Layla.

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:40.378
What are you
screamin' about now?

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.628
This stupid fucking
thing never works,

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:43.888
and when it does work

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.140
it works for all of 10 seconds.

01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:48.888
Something funny?

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:50.388
He's not done anything to you.

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:52.138
Just leave him alone.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:55.398
I swear to God, nothing
works in this place.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.398
Junk.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.148
Just fucking junk everywhere.

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:00.148
Mom, can I play on my tablet.

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:03.158
Not until you've done
what I asked you to do

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.408
three hours ago.

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:05.408
I did it.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:06.910
Jacob, get to your room.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:10.158
One of Mommy's men
will be around shortly.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.658
Hugh, don't be disgusting.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.918
As if he don't know
where you get your cash.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.670
Your Mum's a cheaper, she is.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.418
Does that look like
it's been taken out?

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.178
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.178
Yes, and ugly.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.678
What did you just
say, you little shit?

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.430
Hugh, lay off him.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.678
I've got a headache.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.928
Oh, I've got a headache.

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:33.438
I can't take the rubbish.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.688
Hell, I can't go to school.

01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:38.688
All I hear from this
place is excuses.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:40.190
Just a bunch of slobs.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:43.700
Why don't you leave then?

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.448
You wish.

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:48.198
Hugh.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.948
Pack it in, okay.

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:52.448
That kid needs to learn,
he needs to learn respect.

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:53.458
What?

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.208
For you?

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.208
You're the joke.

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:57.210
Hugh.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.460
Why do you treat me like this?

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:04.468
Don't I look after you, don't
I look after both of you?

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:05.220
You do.

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:08.968
You look after us so good.

01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:13.980
You look after us so, so good.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.230
You are so, so good to us.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.980
You're my baby.

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:23.490
No one hurts my baby.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.740
What would I do without you?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.250
Hello Jacob.

01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:45.760
Hello.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.260
I like
your drawings.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.018
Shannon, how did you get in?

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.520
Hugh let me in.

01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:57.770
No, he didn't.

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:04.528
I will never, ever
ever ever leave you.

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:07.530
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.540
What would you give
me for a kiss, Jacob?

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:22.800
I don't have anything else.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:28.800
Smile.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.798
What?

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.050
Smile for me, Jacob.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.560
You have a lovely smile.

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:39.560
You don't sound like Shannon.

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.310
Please, for me.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.070
Smile.

01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:48.320
You've got such
lovely teeth, Jacob.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.068
I want them.

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.328
What?

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.080
A tooth.

01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:57.330
A tooth for a kiss.

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:02.330
Wait, I don't understand.

01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:09.340
You will.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.098
Come on, put your
foot down, Mom.

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.598
You know these roads
better than I do.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.098
And you call
Matt straight away

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.608
and tell him to
get to Layla's now.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:25.610
All right.

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.358
Ah, there you go.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.610
Get that down ya.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.868
Have you got anymore?

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:40.118
Layla, what's up
with you lately?

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.368
You been sniffin' it
just like it's sherbet.

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:43.380
I'm fine.

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.630
Will you go and check on him?

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.140
You pissed your pants again?

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:00.890
Go on.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.420
The fuck?

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.190
Hugh.

01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:01.700
Hugh, what's going on?

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.218
Oh my God.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:34.240
No!

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.008
Layla, it's Jen.

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:04.270
Layla, where are you?

01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:11.268
I think something's wrong.

01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:12.768
Well, the door doesn't
even look locked.

01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:14.028
Where is it?

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.278
Is it there?

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.028
I think we better
go in together, okay?

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:21.030
Yeah, we do.

01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:27.540
Layla.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.810
Show yourself, demon!

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:55.068
Walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:57.318
I will fear no evil!

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.818
You're
a good little boy.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.568
No, that's not
Matt that you want.

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:03.068
It's me, okay.

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:04.330
Anyone else but Matt.

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:06.580
And your spawn.

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:10.080
Shannon.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.330
Why did you let me die?

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:18.337
Look, we need to draw this
thing out into the open.

01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:20.090
There's too many
shadows in here.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.598
Do you not love me?

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.848
Come on, we need to
pull this thing out!

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:34.608
Shannon.

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:35.859
Matt.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.120
Will I go to heaven, Joe?

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:50.620
You ain't goin'
anywhere, mate.

01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:53.877
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, all right?

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.130
Not while I'm around.

01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:59.377
I swear I won't let
anything happen to you.

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:00.130
Okay.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.890
You can call me Dad, you know.

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:08.140
Dad.

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:19.399
We need anything, we should
bring in anything okay.

01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:21.899
Sugar.

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.908
What's happened?

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:26.660
Matt's dead.

01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:29.658
We weren't strong enough.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:30.660
Dead?

01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:33.408
We need to call the police.

01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:35.417
There is nothing the
police can do, okay.

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.917
We need anything
with sugar in it.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.667
The police can't stop this.

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:41.167
Just go and get some
paraffin and rags, okay.

01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:43.417
We burnt this bitch
to the ground before,

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.428
and we'll do it again

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.678
but this time for good.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.680
Got it?

01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:50.430
This ends tonight.

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.188
What's happening?

01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:30.220
Hey, we need all we can get.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.228
Is that everything, yeah?

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.480
Okay, we need to fill
these with pop now, okay.

01:10:39.730 --> 01:10:41.478
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.238
Just find rags,
paraffin, anything to burn.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:44.988
But there's nothing here.

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:46.488
All that stuff was with our Dad.

01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:48.738
She's just got a
load of crap here.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.488
She's living like a tramp.

01:10:50.490 --> 01:10:51.988
What is this thing?

01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:53.998
I don't know, it's
too hard to explain.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.500
I always knew your family
would be the death of me.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:01.750
Hey, hey.

01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:07.260
You're not alone.

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:11.258
We'll fight this together.

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:13.770
Kinda glad that you're here.

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.778
Hide over there.

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:32.778
Quick, go on, darling.

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:34.288
Hide over there.

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:56.310
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.310
I've just heard
Matt's messages.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.820
He's talking nonsense, he
said he was coming here.

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.568
Matt's dead.

01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:13.070
So is Layla Hodgson.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.578
There's something coming

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:18.328
and I think you being here
is not gonna help our chances

01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:19.828
of surviving it.

01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:21.828
Good God, Layla's dead.

01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:22.830
And Jacob.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.838
You need to leave, Father.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.340
This is not your fight.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.088
The church.

01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:31.838
We can hold out there
and call the police.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.338
It's got big, heavy
deadbolt doors.

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:35.598
Whatever you're running
from can't get in so easily.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.100
No, I'm not leaving here.

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:39.098
Carla, listen.

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.598
Listen to Father.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.098
All right, we're too
exposed out here.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.358
There's too many
points of entry.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.858
This thing could come
up from any side.

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:50.108
We've not always
seen eye to eye,

01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:54.868
but if you need my help
I'm offering sanctuary.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.368
All right, fine.

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:57.618
But whatever we do we need
to do it fast, all right.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:00.368
We need to pack the car now.

01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:01.118
Right.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:01.870
Go.

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:03.630
Let's go.

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:10.378
God, I can't believe
we're arming ourselves

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.628
with bloody drinks.

01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:13.880
I mean, this is ridiculous.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.638
I know they say sweet,
still, but look at us.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.888
Yeah, I know I know.

01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:21.138
What the bloody hell's
wrong with this thing?

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.138
Let me get mine
from the house.

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.650
Carla, no.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.148
Get behind me!

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:30.400
Get behind me!

01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:41.660
Well done, little man.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.690
Oh, hell no.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.190
Come on.

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:11.940
Come on.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.230
Father.

01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:47.100
Hello.

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:13.370
Hey.

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.880
Hey, wait!

01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:30.890
What are you doing?

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:41.900
Hello!

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.420
What are you doing?

01:17:57.670 --> 01:17:58.670
Are you okay?

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.930
You must be cold.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.180
Just one last one to go.

01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:13.178
What lovely teeth you have.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:16.188
I think she'll love
those as a gift.

01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:17.440
Want me to help you?

01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:31.008
Oh my God, what do I
need, what do I need?

01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:32.758
What do I need?

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.268
Oh my God.

01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:39.270
She doesn't like light.

01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:44.778
Okay, okay.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:45.530
Yes!

01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:29.320
Get away from them, you bitch.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:41.830
Hey!

01:20:43.330 --> 01:20:45.838
You want my sweet tooth, bitch?

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.338
Come get it.

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:06.360
Come on, come on!

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.358
What are you doing?

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.108
Mum, we need to go now!

01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:15.868
It's a choice.

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:16.618
What choice?

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:18.118
Tooth is a choice.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.118
I didn't know what she
was gettin' herself into.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.118
What?

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.618
Tooth gives you a choice.

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:26.878
You either become her or
you sacrifice your child.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.628
What sort of a mother
sacrifices their child?

01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:31.878
And even if you become them,

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.880
you have to hunt down
the one you love.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:36.640
It's a trick.

01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:39.640
Tooth is a bad fairy.

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.638
I love you.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.398
Joe, get her out of her.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.148
No!

01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:47.398
No!

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.400
No, no!

01:22:02.410 --> 01:22:03.410
No!

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:13.670
No!
