07:23.735 --> 07:26.113
- Okay.
- Hur... hurry up!

07:26.279 --> 07:27.972
- Slow down, dude.
- No.

07:28.097 --> 07:30.274
Blake and Jillian
won't survive much longer.

07:30.399 --> 07:31.709
They both use roll-on deodorant.

07:31.834 --> 07:33.645
That stuff is like wild animal nip.

07:33.770 --> 07:35.013
What about our survival, Ders, huh?

07:35.138 --> 07:36.498
I'm starving to death

07:36.773 --> 07:37.832
ever since you ripped
the beef jerky out of my hands.

07:38.074 --> 07:39.625
- You gave it to me.
- Yeah.

07:39.791 --> 07:41.653
And then you handed it to a dog

07:41.920 --> 07:44.338
when you should've handed it
to my belly

07:44.504 --> 07:45.923
'cause dogs
can't sniff through bellies.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.301
Dogs do not have belly sense, Ders!

07:47.467 --> 07:49.727
Idiot.
Stupid woods!

07:50.010 --> 07:51.388
I'm gonna die in the stupid woods!

07:51.687 --> 07:52.764
- Not helping.
- I hate the stupid woo...

07:52.889 --> 07:53.890
What was that?

07:54.257 --> 07:56.060
That was a car door
in the stupid woods.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.812
- That's a military jeep!
- Whoa.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.480
Oh, my God, it was probably

08:00.646 --> 08:02.441
abandoned here during the Golf War.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.109
No, definitely not.
It's a Geo Tracker.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.576
My mom used to have one.

08:05.701 --> 08:06.711
Said she was gonna
give it to me, but...

08:06.836 --> 08:08.289
Never happened.

08:08.414 --> 08:09.698
Yeah, she probably
drove it during the Golf War.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.950
Technically.

08:12.275 --> 08:14.410
Time to tee off.

08:14.576 --> 08:16.038
Get that?
It's a Golf War reference.

08:16.279 --> 08:17.580
I understand it.

08:17.914 --> 08:18.956
Ahh...

08:19.081 --> 08:21.501
Crush!

08:21.784 --> 08:26.172
Another planet devoured
by the mighty Galactus.

08:34.996 --> 08:36.057
This is nice.

08:36.222 --> 08:38.142
We never get alone time like this.

08:38.267 --> 08:38.852
I hear ya.

08:39.018 --> 08:42.438
I wish Ders and Adam
were here too.

08:42.605 --> 08:47.444
So, um, like, are you scared
that the dog is gonna come back?

08:47.610 --> 08:50.988
Oh, pssh, no. Come on.
That thing's probably long gone,

08:51.113 --> 08:52.623
looking for food or something.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.826
That's easy for you to say.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.745
My parents were eaten by dogs.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.788
At least that's
what my foster parents told me.

08:58.954 --> 09:02.084
Whoa, that's...
that's heavy. I'm sorry.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.235
Oh, no, no, don't be.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.379
Apparently it happened
way before I was born.

09:06.545 --> 09:07.505
Ah.

09:10.382 --> 09:13.277
Look, if you're still scared, I
can go make you some camouflage.

09:13.552 --> 09:14.578
Really?

09:14.703 --> 09:16.764
Yeah, we'll get you to blend in.

09:16.930 --> 09:18.382
I mean, if you think that'll be...

09:18.507 --> 09:21.727
yah!

09:21.944 --> 09:24.356
Oh, classic!

09:24.522 --> 09:26.991
Okay, go ahead and rub that around.

09:27.274 --> 09:29.444
I'm gonna go get
some sticks and leaves.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.719
Okay.

09:34.456 --> 09:37.869
Oh, my God.
Jillian.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.954
It's ditch weed.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.917
It's weed!

09:43.165 --> 09:47.045
Yes! Thank you, based God!
Praise Allah!

09:48.962 --> 09:50.681
Yes!

09:50.806 --> 09:55.552
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:55.677 --> 09:58.723
Oh, I just want it
to smell all over me.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.349
- All right. Oh, God.

10:00.515 --> 10:02.626
Here we go. I'm gonna
go around and get it started.

10:02.751 --> 10:04.021
Wait...
no, I was supposed to do that.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.663
Ow, let's go, Ders!

10:05.788 --> 10:07.522
Do I need to get back there
and help push this bitch?

10:07.899 --> 10:09.167
That would be nice!

10:09.292 --> 10:11.069
Well, I'm a little busy
steering the starship, buddy.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.403
All right, now we're cooking.

10:12.628 --> 10:14.405
- You got it?
- Ders, get in! I got it!

10:14.571 --> 10:16.073
- Coming around, coming around.
- I got it. Whoo!

10:16.239 --> 10:17.975
No thanks to you.
A little help from you.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.743
- Good job.
- All right, okay.

10:19.868 --> 10:21.079
All right, wait, turn
the lights on; It's pretty dark.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.580
All right. Lights!

10:22.746 --> 10:24.215
Lights on!

10:24.340 --> 10:26.751
Man, this technology is dated, dude.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.169
Just use the lever
right there on the side.

10:28.335 --> 10:29.420
Oh, okay, control, lights on.
There it is!

10:29.545 --> 10:30.778
- Lights on!
- Hit the brakes!

10:31.046 --> 10:32.340
I'm hitting them!
I'm bailing!

10:32.506 --> 10:33.382
What? What? Adam!

10:33.615 --> 10:35.885
Aah!

10:38.137 --> 10:41.307
Oh, God.
Yeah, that thing is scootin'.

10:41.473 --> 10:44.561
It's like the lovebug.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.071
Hey, when you said,
"Hit the brakes..."

10:47.196 --> 10:48.472
Yeah.

10:48.597 --> 10:50.775
Did you mean the left brakes
or the right brakes?

10:50.941 --> 10:52.945
Whoo. It's been a long time
since I've driven.

10:54.000 --> 11:00.074

11:03.091 --> 11:04.974
{pub}Oh, hell, yeah, ditch...

11:05.886 --> 11:06.917
Weed.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.371
Ahh.

11:08.496 --> 11:10.206
Oh, uh, did you
want to hit the pipe cone?

11:10.331 --> 11:12.923
Oh, no, I'm not a big pot person.

11:13.089 --> 11:16.278
But I feel like
one time I saw someone

11:16.403 --> 11:17.914
blowing smoke
into someone else's mouth.

11:18.039 --> 11:19.179
Is that a thing?

11:19.345 --> 11:20.550
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

11:20.675 --> 11:22.151
That's called shotgunning.

11:22.276 --> 11:24.184
You actually get way higher
when you do that.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.436
Oh, cool.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.623
Would you want to try it?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.925
- With you? Yeah... yes.
- Yeah.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.693
Totally.

11:30.818 --> 11:32.194
- I mean, whatever, sure, yeah.
- All right, yeah.

11:32.319 --> 11:34.487
- All right, come on, get close.
- Okay.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.370
Now open your mouth.

11:41.495 --> 11:45.532
Blow my mind, Blakey.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.110
- Mm...
- Heck, yes! All right.

11:48.235 --> 11:49.879
All right, now, hold your breath
as long as you can, okay?

11:50.004 --> 11:51.814
This stuff's kinda weak,
so I'm just gonna just

11:51.939 --> 11:54.617
help that THC
get into your brain, okay?

11:54.742 --> 11:56.819
- Mm...
- Okay? Yeah!

11:57.050 --> 11:58.384
That's helping.

11:58.550 --> 12:01.512
Oh, yeah. You are gonna
feel like a zombie after this.

12:01.678 --> 12:04.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
just 60 more seconds.

12:04.385 --> 12:06.309
You feeling anything?
Feeling anything? Yup!

12:06.475 --> 12:08.979
Mad hit, Jillian, you look zoned out!

12:09.145 --> 12:10.522
Jillian.

12:10.792 --> 12:12.441
Uh-oh.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.837
Hello,
this is a little forest elf.

12:14.962 --> 12:16.402
Wake up, Jillian.

12:16.630 --> 12:19.364
Come on. Come on.

12:19.530 --> 12:20.543
Come on, just through here.

12:20.668 --> 12:21.644
Blake and Jillian gotta be close.

12:21.769 --> 12:22.742
This sucks, dude!

12:23.004 --> 12:24.703
- I know.
- I'm starving to death.

12:24.972 --> 12:26.282
Our car ran away.

12:26.407 --> 12:28.317
My body's withering away
into a boy body

12:28.442 --> 12:30.500
when I should have
a fully grown man body!

12:30.666 --> 12:32.126
- Yeah.
- Look for berries

12:32.346 --> 12:34.657
or any sort of... like, if we can
find a rabbit, I would...

12:34.782 --> 12:36.593
I'm not looking for rabbits.

12:36.718 --> 12:40.463
Oh, look what I found.

12:40.588 --> 12:42.098
Got him.
Oh, I got him.

12:42.223 --> 12:44.889
Adam, what are you doing?

12:45.055 --> 12:47.558
Whatever it takes.

12:47.724 --> 12:48.774
Oh, come on!

12:48.899 --> 12:49.936
Jesus.

12:50.102 --> 12:54.110
Actually, not bad.

12:54.235 --> 12:57.110
Pretty good, kinda tastes
like lobster with skin.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.071
That's good to know.
Can we please <i>vamonos?</i>

12:59.237 --> 13:01.406
Why didn't you tell me nature
lizards were so delicious?

13:01.572 --> 13:02.824
- All right.
- Mm.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.654
You're probably a little embarrassed

13:04.779 --> 13:06.369
that I'm more of a survival
master than you are, huh?

13:06.647 --> 13:07.857
First lesson in nature,

13:07.982 --> 13:09.659
they're not called "nature lizards."

13:09.784 --> 13:10.832
Just "lizards."

13:10.998 --> 13:12.542
Well, they're not city lizards.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.063
No, they're not.

13:14.188 --> 13:15.464
I'm in the nature,
and I found a lizard.

13:15.589 --> 13:19.502
Henceforth, therefore,
it is a nature lizard.

13:19.627 --> 13:21.050
You're probably
too scared to eat one.

13:21.295 --> 13:22.505
Not scared.

13:22.630 --> 13:23.572
By the way, if we call them
"city lizards,"

13:23.697 --> 13:25.341
they'd be Mondo Gecko.

13:25.466 --> 13:26.542
That's a whole different thing
I'll get into later

13:26.667 --> 13:27.307
because I am a survival master.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.078
- I'll find a...
- There.

13:29.203 --> 13:30.310
- Here we go. See?
- There's one.

13:30.786 --> 13:31.770
Yeah. Eat it.

13:32.006 --> 13:33.771
Not scared.

13:33.937 --> 13:36.316
- In my mouth.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.386
I didn't think
you were gonna do that.

13:37.511 --> 13:39.288
They're not bad, right?

13:39.413 --> 13:41.724
At first they're a little gushy.
It's like one of those gushers.

13:41.849 --> 13:43.526
But they don't taste like
berries or artificial flavors,

13:43.651 --> 13:45.161
they taste like...

13:45.286 --> 13:46.492
Nutrients.
What's wrong?

13:46.658 --> 13:47.864
- You okay?

13:47.989 --> 13:49.078
- No.
- You gotta use your teeth, bud.

13:49.244 --> 13:50.830
- It's caught...
- Use your teeth.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.290
- You've eaten food before.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.875
- Oh, God!

13:54.041 --> 13:55.418
Oh, it's coming out your nose!

13:55.584 --> 13:56.773
- What?
- The tail's out!

13:56.898 --> 13:57.670
I got it!
I got it!

13:57.836 --> 13:59.589
Oh, God!

13:59.755 --> 14:01.549
- Get it! Get it!
- No... ow... ow!

14:01.715 --> 14:03.301
Oh, my God, she's dead.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.678
I gotta dig a grave.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.515
Gotta dig a grave.

14:06.640 --> 14:07.597
Just dig a grave.

14:08.930 --> 14:11.087
- Oh, God.
- Oh! Oh, Jillian!

14:11.212 --> 14:12.643
Hey! There you are, buddy.

14:12.809 --> 14:14.645
Did that go
how it was supposed to go?

14:14.811 --> 14:16.358
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

14:16.483 --> 14:18.358
Yeah, yeah, no, that's...
that's... that's it.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.829
I got high.

14:20.108 --> 14:22.131
- You got so high!

14:22.256 --> 14:23.363
You...

14:23.529 --> 14:24.867
- Oh!
- Hey, hey.

14:24.992 --> 14:28.071
It's okay.
It's just a coyote.

14:28.196 --> 14:31.264
Really, really far away coyote.

14:31.389 --> 14:33.164
What if there are others, closer?

14:33.330 --> 14:35.244
They're wild animals, Blake.

14:35.369 --> 14:39.381
Jillian, we're
wild animals too, all right?

14:39.506 --> 14:41.483
There is a wild animal inside of you.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.175
- You think?
- Hell, yeah. You kidding me?

14:44.341 --> 14:46.889
And you probably got something
like just crazy,

14:47.014 --> 14:49.892
just a savage beast inside of you.

14:50.017 --> 14:51.349
What do you think it is?

14:51.515 --> 14:53.309
Oh, I-I don't know.

14:53.988 --> 14:54.936
A lion?

14:55.102 --> 14:56.899
Oh, yeah!
Totally!

14:57.024 --> 14:58.968
- Yeah?
- You are so a lion.

14:59.093 --> 15:00.733
Well, a lioness.

15:00.899 --> 15:01.859
- Yeah, 'cause of the...
- I'm...

15:02.025 --> 15:02.985
Vagina thing.

15:03.151 --> 15:04.195
- A lady.
- Yeah.

15:04.799 --> 15:07.657
Come on, yeah. Let's hear it.
Let's hear your lioness roar.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.013
No, what? What if...
what if the killer dog hears us?

15:10.283 --> 15:12.715
Well, then, that killer dog's
gonna have to...

15:12.840 --> 15:14.790
have to fight Jillian the lioness!

15:14.956 --> 15:17.554
And, uh... and Blake the...

15:17.679 --> 15:18.710
Mastodon!

15:24.423 --> 15:25.424
- Yeah!

15:25.590 --> 15:26.676
- Oh, yeah!

15:26.842 --> 15:28.297
Yeah, that's...

15:28.422 --> 15:29.899
That's cool, Jillian,
I never seen this side of you.

15:30.024 --> 15:32.769
You got a...
You got a wild side, girl.

15:33.056 --> 15:34.971
- Kinda like it.

15:35.096 --> 15:36.338
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:36.463 --> 15:38.274
So what makes you a mastodon?

15:38.399 --> 15:41.024
Is it 'cause of your big,
giant trunk?

15:41.190 --> 15:44.111
No, I have to take
a mastodon-sized crap.

15:44.672 --> 15:47.617
Hold down the fort,
Lioness Jillian.

15:47.742 --> 15:49.185
- All right.
- Whoa.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.201
- It's coming out already.
- Oh.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.315
- What was that?
- Oh, my God.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.558
It's the dog!

15:56.683 --> 15:58.427
I don't care, man,
let it come for us.

15:58.552 --> 16:00.043
Come on, dude.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.264
Don't be such a baby.

16:01.389 --> 16:02.598
Just because mother nature

16:02.723 --> 16:04.600
whipped out her delicious mammary

16:04.725 --> 16:08.051
and sprayed nature lizard milk
down my throat,

16:08.217 --> 16:10.372
and all she wants to do
is murder you.

16:10.497 --> 16:11.846
You must feel bad about that.

16:12.012 --> 16:12.596
No.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.430
We are men!
We are doing this!

16:14.555 --> 16:16.029
We are men in the woods,
and we're doing this!

16:16.154 --> 16:16.738
All right.

16:16.863 --> 16:17.762
Men in the woods,
and we're doing this!

16:17.887 --> 16:19.426
We are men in the woods
and we're doing this!

16:19.551 --> 16:21.189
Okay, ow.
I think I hurt my ankle.

16:24.211 --> 16:25.485
- Hey!

16:25.651 --> 16:28.446
Guess what.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.127
I wasn't back there
taking a mastodon dump.

16:31.252 --> 16:35.031
I was changing my animal
to better match your lioness.

16:35.156 --> 16:36.899
I'm Blake...

16:37.024 --> 16:38.165
The dire wolf.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.166
Ooh, I like that.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.295
Did you know that when the dude wolf

16:43.461 --> 16:45.875
engages in sex,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.842
his genitals swell up?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.468
- Oh, that's very coo...
- I wasn't finished.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.762
Oh.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.264
His genitals swell up, and he...

16:55.430 --> 16:58.684
Hooks into the chick wolf,

16:58.850 --> 17:02.158
and she can't get away
for up to 20 minutes.

17:02.283 --> 17:03.481
Pretty cool, huh?

17:03.647 --> 17:06.358
Well, yeah, but I'm a lioness.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.564
Oh, I know.

17:08.689 --> 17:09.832
But haven't you always wanted to see

17:09.957 --> 17:11.114
two different animals doing it?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.202
- Yes.
- Me too.

17:13.327 --> 17:15.117
So what do you say?

17:15.363 --> 17:18.371
Permission to hug ya?

17:18.537 --> 17:21.707
Hook it up, Blake.

17:24.538 --> 17:26.420
I can't wait to tell
the dudes about this.

17:26.586 --> 17:27.316
- Wait, what?
- Huh?

17:27.441 --> 17:28.751
No.
No, you can't tell them.

17:28.876 --> 17:30.132
- What?
- You can't tell anybody.

17:30.298 --> 17:32.154
- No.
- Wha... that's what you do.

17:32.279 --> 17:35.805
You nail the girl to the wall,
you tell the buddies back home.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.807
Come on, you're the lioness,
I'm the wolf!

17:37.973 --> 17:39.929
We're gonna rule
the Telamericorp jungle!

17:40.054 --> 17:42.269
I'll let you eat my butt
on top of the photocopier.

17:42.435 --> 17:44.100
N... wait... no, Blake,
we have to think about this.

17:44.225 --> 17:46.102
Okay? Just... just...
let's not rush.

17:46.227 --> 17:47.169
- What?
- We need to think...

17:47.294 --> 17:48.067
come on, wild animals...

17:48.233 --> 17:49.105
they don't think!

17:49.230 --> 17:50.273
They just...

17:50.398 --> 17:51.908
Do each other!
Now, come on!

17:52.033 --> 17:53.531
Life's short.
Kiss hard.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.907
- What does that even mean?

17:56.157 --> 17:57.579
- I'm gonna bite your ass!
- Stop...

17:57.704 --> 17:59.115
No, wait... don't, please.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.121
Bad wolf!

18:00.374 --> 18:01.583
No! No!

18:01.708 --> 18:03.124
Okay, Blake, I love you,

18:03.290 --> 18:05.388
but you're coming off
a teensy bit rapey.

18:05.513 --> 18:06.836
- What are you talking about?
- No! No!

18:07.002 --> 18:09.125
- Being men.
- All right.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.928
I could... I want some of that...
that teat milk or whatever.

18:12.053 --> 18:13.718
- Whoo.
- Get off of me, you wolf!

18:13.884 --> 18:16.137
- It's got Jillian.

18:16.303 --> 18:17.967
- Find weapons... find a weapon.
- Weapons?

18:18.092 --> 18:18.890
- Find a weapon.
- What?

18:19.056 --> 18:19.849
Yup.

18:20.428 --> 18:21.437
You ready to quit being a pussy

18:21.562 --> 18:22.604
and start being that scout thing

18:22.729 --> 18:23.603
I think I remember you talking about?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.641
Oh, come on.
Oh, no, bad wolf!

18:25.766 --> 18:26.773
You know this.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.150
Get off of me, wolf!

18:29.316 --> 18:30.879
Oh!

18:31.004 --> 18:32.695
Oh-ho-ho-ho...

18:32.861 --> 18:33.916
Stab it in the head!
Right in the eye socket!

18:34.041 --> 18:35.851
- Blake, Jillian?
- Guys?

18:35.976 --> 18:37.241
Was a dog here attacking you?
What are you doing?

18:37.407 --> 18:39.286
Uh-oh, I can taste
my brain in my nose.

18:39.513 --> 18:41.871
Jillian, are you okay?
Did we save your life?

18:42.037 --> 18:43.539
Yeah... what?
Nobody hooked anyone.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.624
- We were just... I...
- Shh! Shut up!

18:44.790 --> 18:47.129
What?

18:47.254 --> 18:48.712
I smell burritos.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.132
Follow the leader.

18:50.257 --> 18:51.233
That's me in this situation;
I'm the leader.

18:51.358 --> 18:52.601
Yeah.

18:52.726 --> 18:53.970
I'm the leader in this situation.

18:54.095 --> 18:55.571
We're going this way.
That was the wrong way.

18:55.696 --> 18:56.635
- The leader says go this way.
- Go, Jillian!

19:01.305 --> 19:02.975
{pub}Oh, there it is!

19:03.141 --> 19:04.584
Oh, it's open!

19:04.709 --> 19:06.687
All right, I'm gonna go
get my hot sauce from the car.

19:06.853 --> 19:07.887
My crystals.

19:08.012 --> 19:08.982
- Crystals.
- You guys order for me.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.483
Yeah, I'll get you the pizza.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.734
I'm just joking.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.359
But what if I wasn't?

19:13.484 --> 19:17.764
You'd be like, "What're you
talkin' 'bout, William?"

19:18.032 --> 19:20.618
Looks like I won't be needing
you anymore, little guy.

19:20.784 --> 19:23.162
Have a nice life.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.206
Wait, what's that?

19:25.372 --> 19:26.665
You miss your brothers?

19:26.831 --> 19:29.377
Okay.

19:32.397 --> 19:34.257
Oh.
Here we go. Crystal time.

19:34.906 --> 19:36.816
Very cool.

19:39.777 --> 19:42.181
All right, I've had
just about enough of this!

19:42.347 --> 19:44.768
So I'm gonna give you
one chance to turn around!

19:44.934 --> 19:46.894
Right now!
Walk away.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.765
Let's do this.

19:52.890 --> 19:54.068
Come on.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.446
Come on, you bitch!

19:58.489 --> 19:59.839
Mmm.

19:59.964 --> 20:02.410
- This isn't that good, is it?
- Mm-mm.

20:02.576 --> 20:03.744
It's not good.

20:03.910 --> 20:05.511
You could drown it in the salsa,

20:05.636 --> 20:07.707
but the salsa tastes like
there's a cup of dirt in it.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.792
Hey.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.652
So you're okay?

20:12.777 --> 20:14.887
Yeah. I'm okay.

20:15.012 --> 20:16.215
Are... are you?

20:16.381 --> 20:18.760
Yeah, I'm okay.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.095
Like, okay-okay.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.181
Definitely.
Totally okay.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.515
- Yeah.
- I'm okay too.

20:24.681 --> 20:28.185
In case you guys care, so...
I was out there as well.

20:28.351 --> 20:31.188
Oh, hope you're enjoying
your breakfast burritos.

20:31.354 --> 20:35.235
And if you could, <i>por favor,</i>
keep eye out for Gus.

20:35.465 --> 20:36.945
Haven't seen him around.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.644
I haven't seen your buddy Gus either,

20:38.769 --> 20:40.179
but there is a chance
that he was eaten by a wild dog

20:40.304 --> 20:41.449
that I just murdered
in the parking lot.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.950
- Ay.
- I just murdered it. I got it.

20:43.207 --> 20:46.204
This... this dog?

20:48.846 --> 20:50.124
This one?

20:50.447 --> 20:54.026
You killed my dog?

20:54.151 --> 20:54.921
Hello?
