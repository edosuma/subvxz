WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:08.196
When are they gonna learn that news
about China is an instant page-turner?

00:08.375 --> 00:09.364
What's that?

00:09.542 --> 00:11.772
It's a Wizard electronic organizer
for my dad.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.175
-I'm going to Florida for his birthday.
-How much?

00:14.347 --> 00:15.678
Two hundred. I'll tell him 50.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.579
He doesn't care for the gift,
he gets excited about the deal.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.845
Where are you getting
a Wizard for $50?

00:21.021 --> 00:25.253
I'll tell him I got it on the street and
maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.

00:25.425 --> 00:28.724
I got a message from the Rosses
at work today.

00:28.895 --> 00:31.056
Susan's parents?
When's the last time you talked?

00:31.631 --> 00:34.156
At the funeral, give or take.

00:34.768 --> 00:38.033
Deep down I always kind of felt that
they blamed me for Susan's death.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.695
Why? Because you picked out
the poison envelopes?

00:42.242 --> 00:43.937
That's silly.

00:46.913 --> 00:50.974
Darryl, these are people I know.

00:51.151 --> 00:53.244
Jerry, George.

00:53.420 --> 00:56.514
Nice meeting you. I gotta run,
Elaine. I'll see you later.

00:56.689 --> 00:58.156
Okay.

00:59.692 --> 01:00.716
Still no Puddy?

01:01.628 --> 01:04.461
I think his answering machine's
broken, so I just gave up.

01:05.665 --> 01:06.689
What do you think?

01:06.866 --> 01:09.334
What, about you dating a black guy?
What's the big deal?

01:09.502 --> 01:13.495
-What black guy?
-Darryl. He's black, isn't he?

01:13.673 --> 01:15.573
He is?

01:15.742 --> 01:18.540
-No, he isn't.
-Isn't he, Elaine?

01:18.711 --> 01:21.077
-You think?
-I thought he looked Irish.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.415
-What's his last name?
-Nelson.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.676
-That's not Irish.
-I think he's black.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.183
Should we talking about this?

01:27.353 --> 01:29.321
-I think it's okay.
-No, it isn't.

01:29.489 --> 01:31.252
-Why not?
-Well, it would be okay...

01:31.424 --> 01:32.914
...if Darryl was here.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.425
-If he's black.
-Is he black?

01:35.595 --> 01:36.584
Does it matter?

01:36.763 --> 01:39.323
No, of course not.
I mean, I'd just like to know.

01:39.499 --> 01:42.195
-So you need to know?
-No, I don't need to know.

01:42.368 --> 01:44.962
I just think it would be nice
if I knew.

01:45.138 --> 01:46.298
Shall I take that?

01:46.473 --> 01:47.770
-One sec.
-Oh, here.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.203
Oh, yeah, hang on.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.985 --> 02:02.284
-Mrs. Ross, it's George.
-Who?

02:02.989 --> 02:06.356
George Costanza. Susan's friend?

02:08.561 --> 02:10.654
Long time no speak.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.889
We're all out of lime juice.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.000
I told that woman to buy more.

02:15.668 --> 02:17.898
George,
the Susan Ross Foundation...

02:18.071 --> 02:19.971
...is having an event this weekend.

02:20.140 --> 02:25.305
Oh, I just leased a house
out in the Hamptons...

02:25.478 --> 02:28.572
...and I have got to get out there
this weekend and sign the papers.

02:28.748 --> 02:30.375
I'm going back to bed.

02:31.017 --> 02:33.747
-Thank you for calling, George.
-<i>Oh, sure.</i>

02:33.920 --> 02:36.218
I mean, after all,
you were almost my....

02:36.389 --> 02:38.857
Okay, I gotta go.

02:40.593 --> 02:42.220
House in the Hamptons?

02:42.395 --> 02:44.226
I've been lying about my income
for years.

02:44.397 --> 02:47.298
I figured I could afford a fake
house in the Hamptons.

02:48.034 --> 02:49.296
-Well.
-Hey.

02:49.469 --> 02:52.495
Well, grab a cigar, boys.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.162
Yeah, it's time to celebrate.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.173
-What are we celebrating?
-You remember my coffee table book?

02:57.343 --> 02:58.776
With the little legs.

02:58.945 --> 03:00.640
That's the one.

03:01.481 --> 03:06.009
A big Hollywood so-and-so
optioned it for a movie.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.849
How are they gonna make
that book into a movie?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.619
Remember that photo book
on toy ray guns?

03:14.794 --> 03:17.888
-Yeah.
-<i>Independence Day?</i>

03:19.199 --> 03:20.564
How much are they paying you?

03:20.733 --> 03:23.600
Let's just say I don't have to
worry about working for a while.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.261
A long while.

03:27.073 --> 03:29.803
That's funny, because
I haven't seen you working...

03:29.976 --> 03:34.037
...for a while. A long while.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.546
And you're not going to,
because I'm hanging it up.

03:36.716 --> 03:40.049
Boys, I'm retiring.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.517
From what?

03:41.721 --> 03:44.281
From the grind.
I mean, who needs it?

03:44.457 --> 03:47.085
You know, I've accomplished
everything I've set out to do.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.217
What's that?

03:49.395 --> 03:52.364
Oh, bought myself
a little retirement gift.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.727
A gold watch.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.933
It's not really gold.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.983
-Hey.
-Hey, great music.

04:13.152 --> 04:14.710
Oh, it's my neighbor.

04:14.887 --> 04:17.253
They blast that stuff
24 hours a day. I hate it.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.185
Turn it down!

04:22.695 --> 04:26.597
Oh, wow. These are nice.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.462
Do they have any
cultural significance?

04:29.636 --> 04:31.797
They're African.

04:32.805 --> 04:34.329
Right.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.408
-African.
-Well, not "Africa."

04:37.577 --> 04:39.044
Actually South Africa.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.510
South Africa.

04:41.681 --> 04:46.380
My family used to live there. We got
out years ago. For obvious reasons.

04:46.552 --> 04:50.386
-You know how it is.
-Maybe.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.350
You must hate hot dogs, huh?

04:54.661 --> 04:58.529
Or else you really like them
and that's why you do this.

05:00.233 --> 05:04.795
If I had one of these things
I'd be eating hot dogs all the time.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.802
You gonna buy a hot dog or not?

05:07.340 --> 05:08.830
No.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.246
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.250
It's 5:30 in the morning.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.081
We let you sleep in.

05:26.059 --> 05:30.291
Well, as long as I'm up,
Dad, I got you a birthday present.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.055
Here. Happy birthday.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.995
Oh, Jerry. I should be
buying you presents.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.563
What does that mean?

05:37.737 --> 05:39.830
Leave your father alone.
It's his birthday.

05:42.108 --> 05:44.736
It's a radar detector.

05:45.244 --> 05:49.772
Radar detector. I've never seen
you go over 20 miles an hour.

05:50.049 --> 05:53.644
You're like the grand marshal
of the Rose Bowl parade.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.482
It's a Wizard organizer.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.021
This looks like too much money.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.921
No, I got it from a guy on the street.
It was like 50 bucks.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.857
-You think it's hot?
-Could be.

06:03.029 --> 06:07.432
Attaboy. Helen, Jerry got me
a hot Wizard computer.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.727
I'm right here.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.862
You can do everything with it. You can
get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.201
So I can use it to figure out the tip?

06:16.376 --> 06:19.539
Yeah, I guess. But the really cool
thing is the daily planner.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.976
We can go to the restaurant
to figure out the tips.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.548
Jerry, you're getting your
father too excited.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.446
Hey, buddy. When did you get in?

06:31.924 --> 06:33.789
Kramer, what are you doing here?

06:33.960 --> 06:36.895
I told you I was retiring.
I moved in next door.

06:38.765 --> 06:41.632
Mr. Cornstein died,
and it's a beautiful apartment.

06:41.801 --> 06:45.237
Yeah, your folks said it was for rent,
so I jumped on it.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.702
Kramer, you can't live down here.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.776
This is where people come to die.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.404
Not you.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.173
Older people.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.148
Don't eat cookies for breakfast.

07:00.319 --> 07:04.085
I'll fix you something.
How about a feta cheese omelet?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.781
That sounds great, Mom.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.926
You feed him he'll never leave.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.928
I don't have any feta. How about
cottage cheese and egg beaters?

07:12.598 --> 07:14.657
I guess.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.064
-I don't believe this.
-I know, I know.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.863
Don't I look more relaxed?

07:51.804 --> 07:55.638
So, George, do you have any
thoughts on this Darryl situation?

07:55.808 --> 07:57.207
Actually, I did have a thought.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.373
Why don't you just ask him?

08:02.582 --> 08:07.781
Because if I ask him,
then it's like I really want to know.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.154
Maybe he's...

08:12.692 --> 08:14.660
...mixed.

08:15.528 --> 08:16.859
Is that the right word?

08:17.029 --> 08:19.554
I don't think we're supposed
to be talking about this.

08:19.732 --> 08:22.565
-I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
-You know what? I'm leaving.

08:22.735 --> 08:25.568
-I'll talk to Jerry when he gets back.
-All right.

08:26.973 --> 08:30.170
Oh, Mrs. Ross. Mr. Ross.

08:30.376 --> 08:32.844
Oh, you're George's friend.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.275
We saw him in the city
this weekend.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.508
What happened to his place
in the Hamptons?

08:38.683 --> 08:43.712
The Hamptons? George Costanza?

08:48.094 --> 08:50.289
I don't think so.

08:51.230 --> 08:52.959
Have a good one.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.227
Rosses.

08:59.405 --> 09:02.602
George. We were just
talking about you.

09:03.776 --> 09:06.006
Well, sorry I missed
that charity thing...

09:06.178 --> 09:09.079
...but this was one of those truly
glorious Hampton weekends...

09:09.248 --> 09:12.046
-...that you always hear about.
-Really?

09:12.218 --> 09:13.879
Yeah, I may move out there.

09:15.454 --> 09:17.581
I mean it. I'll do it.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.725
Okay, I'll see you later.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.720
Keep it real.

09:26.832 --> 09:30.928
Another fine meal. And now
for my Wizard tip calculator.

09:31.103 --> 09:33.401
Dad, it's got lots of other functions.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.201
Don't worry.
I'll get to the other functions.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.433
I can't get it open.

09:39.979 --> 09:42.447
Yay, Jerry got it open.

09:45.551 --> 09:49.078
The service was slow, and God
forbid they should refill the water.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.782
How does 12.4 percent sound?

09:53.593 --> 09:59.031
Well, your tip is
$4 and 36.6666 cents.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.825
We'll round down.

10:01.968 --> 10:05.426
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come
down here on your father's birthday.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.937
You've helped take his mind
off the condo election.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.769
Right. You can't run for
condo president because you were...

10:10.943 --> 10:13.605
-...impeached at the other condo.
-I was never impeached.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.576
I resigned.

10:15.748 --> 10:18.182
Even so, the press would bury him.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.444
What press?

10:21.153 --> 10:23.951
The condo newsletter.
The <i>Boca Breeze.</i>

10:24.123 --> 10:26.717
Pinko commie rag.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.623
Hey, Morty. Your boy here.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.789
He just got a date with that
young aquacise instructor.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.832
She's 50.

10:37.003 --> 10:40.905
You know what he's got?
He's got charisma.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.631
-That's my man.
-I'll see you guys.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.036
Yeah.

10:46.412 --> 10:47.470
Yeah.

10:50.016 --> 10:52.985
Morty, what are you looking at?

10:53.252 --> 10:54.879
I'll tell you what I'm looking at.

10:55.054 --> 11:00.856
The next condo board president
of Del Boca Vista, phase three.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.433
Elaine, thank you for the Wizard.

11:08.868 --> 11:11.234
Wow, it's got so many functions.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.167
Yeah, yeah, forget about all that.

11:13.339 --> 11:17.207
First thing is first,
warranty information.

11:17.376 --> 11:20.368
Name. We know that. Hobbies.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.878
-Skiing, racquetball--
-Well, I don't do that stuff.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.574
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

11:25.751 --> 11:28.379
Oh, Here's one. Race.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.282
Isn't that optional?

11:30.456 --> 11:35.393
It certainly should be.
It's nobody's damn business.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.861
But they really would like to know.

11:39.265 --> 11:42.200
-All right. I'm Asian.
-What?

11:42.368 --> 11:43.630
Just to mess with them.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.529
Right. Good one.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.234
Average income.
Over a hundred thousand.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.308
-Really?
-So does that matter?

11:54.880 --> 11:59.647
No. But it's very nice to know.

12:03.656 --> 12:06.682
So did you figure out Darryl's...

12:07.493 --> 12:08.926
...you know?

12:09.128 --> 12:13.224
I've given up. So now we're going
to a bunch of Spanish restaurants.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.230
Figure that'll cover us either way.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.168
You're a master of race relations.

12:19.338 --> 12:22.569
So Kramer's running
for president of the condo?

12:23.309 --> 12:26.278
Yeah. It's all my father's doing.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.274
He wants to install Kramer
in a puppet regime...

12:29.448 --> 12:31.746
...and then wield power
from behind the scenes.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.647
Preferably from the sauna
in the clubhouse.

12:35.454 --> 12:37.581
-Who are they running against?
-Common sense...

12:37.757 --> 12:39.748
...and a guy in a wheelchair.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.119
-Jerry?
-He's still down with his folks.

12:43.295 --> 12:44.592
What are you doing here?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.629
-Elaine. Elaine.
-I'm getting his mail.

12:46.799 --> 12:49.529
-Oh, no.
-He asked you to get the mail?

12:50.970 --> 12:52.870
Jerry,
why is Elaine getting your mail?

12:53.038 --> 12:56.997
George, listen to me.
I have a very important job for you.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.339
I want you to come by twice a day...

13:00.513 --> 13:03.539
...and flush the toilet
so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.610
-What?
-Well, what about the mail?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.312
This is far more important.

13:10.489 --> 13:13.822
You must exercise the gaskets,
George.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.263
All right, Jerry, I'll do it. See you.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.229
So, ran into the Rosses again.

13:23.402 --> 13:25.233
Oh, right, at the coffee shop.

13:25.404 --> 13:28.737
Where did they get the idea that you
have a place in the Hamptons?

13:32.578 --> 13:34.512
-From me.
-What did you say?

13:34.680 --> 13:37.547
I told them I have a place
in the Hamptons.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.309
What did you say?

13:39.485 --> 13:40.975
I told them you didn't.

13:42.521 --> 13:46.651
And I laughed and I laughed.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.727
So they know.

13:49.895 --> 13:52.591
-Those liars.
-But you lied first.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.063
But they let me go on and on
all about the Hamptons.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.326
They never said a thing.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.402
You don't let somebody lie
when you know.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.835
-You call them a liar.
-Like you're a liar.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.940
Yes. Thank you. Was that so hard?

14:03.108 --> 14:07.408
So this is over? Not over?
I'm betting not over.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.744
Not by a long shot.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.815
I'm calling the Rosses
and inviting them...

14:11.984 --> 14:13.849
...to my nonexistent place
in the Hamptons.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.385
Then we'll see who blinks first.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.618
Haven't you done enough
to these people?

14:20.893 --> 14:25.330
This is not about them.
Now if you'll excuse me...

14:25.497 --> 14:28.728
...I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.

14:32.571 --> 14:34.232
Vote for Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.738
I'm running for condo president.
Like your vote.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.399
Thanks.

14:38.944 --> 14:42.641
Remember, ma'am, a vote for me
is a vote for Kramer.

14:43.249 --> 14:46.047
-Can you cut my meat?
-Gladly.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.007
-Coffee?
-Sure.

15:16.181 --> 15:17.239
Are you black?

15:19.351 --> 15:21.114
Or should I bring some cream?

15:21.287 --> 15:24.256
I'm black. Oh, you know what?
Bring a little cream.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.984
-Look at that.
-Did you hear that?

15:29.194 --> 15:30.923
-What?
-God, there are still people...

15:31.096 --> 15:33.826
...who have trouble
with an interracial couple.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.626
Interracial? Us?

15:36.902 --> 15:38.335
Isn't that unbelievable?

15:38.504 --> 15:41.871
Yes. It's awful.

15:42.041 --> 15:46.000
They're upset because
we're an interracial couple.

15:46.178 --> 15:47.770
That is racism.

15:48.847 --> 15:50.781
-I don't feel like eating.
-Me neither.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.578
Well, maybe this turkey club.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.682
So here I am.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.620
Ready to take you to the Hamptons.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.784
Sounds grand.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.327
Do you have your bathing suits?

16:04.496 --> 16:05.656
It's March.

16:08.400 --> 16:12.393
Speak now or we are headed
to the Hamptons.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.569
It's a two-hour drive.

16:15.741 --> 16:20.508
Once you get in that car
we are going all the way...

16:21.046 --> 16:22.911
...to the Hamptons.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.812
All right, you wanna get nuts...

16:28.988 --> 16:32.822
...come on, let's get nuts!

16:36.195 --> 16:38.493
Dad, you know, you can
program this thing to beep...

16:38.664 --> 16:40.222
...every time you need a vitamin.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.363
Dad, you look so different.

16:46.372 --> 16:48.067
We're campaigning, Jerry.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.073
To rule the people,
one must walk among them.

16:51.243 --> 16:53.643
This is the homestretch.
Tomorrow's the election.

16:53.812 --> 16:56.440
Right, yeah. The poll's close
after dinner. Three o'clock.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.082
But then when we win...

16:58.250 --> 17:03.153
...the celebration goes all night
until the break of 8 p.m.

17:03.622 --> 17:06.420
You could put that whole
schedule right in your daily planner.

17:06.592 --> 17:10.255
-Daily what?
-Have you read today's <i>Boca Breeze?</i>

17:10.628 --> 17:12.756
Hey, look at that.
Picture of me, huh?

17:12.931 --> 17:18.233
Yeah, "Candidate Cosmo Kramer,
caught barefoot in clubhouse."

17:19.405 --> 17:21.099
Barefoot in the clubhouse?
Kramer...

17:21.272 --> 17:23.366
...don't you realize
this is against the rules?

17:23.541 --> 17:26.477
Well, I couldn't find my shoes.

17:26.645 --> 17:30.046
These people work and wait
their whole lives to move down here...

17:30.215 --> 17:34.515
...sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot,
and enforce these rules.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.551
-Who wants hot chocolate?
-Oh, yeah.

17:37.322 --> 17:40.723
This is a huge scandal.
We need damage control.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.589
All right, look, people seem
to like those tip calculators.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.593
-Wizards.
-How about if we give one out...

17:45.764 --> 17:48.062
...to every member
on the condo board?

17:48.233 --> 17:49.666
Kramer.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.427
There are 20 people on the board.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.798
Thank God you can get that deal.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.567
Payoffs. Now we're playing politics.

17:56.742 --> 18:00.109
All right, what do we do next,
Morty, huh? Wiretaps? Slush funds?

18:00.279 --> 18:01.405
First I need a nap.

18:02.448 --> 18:05.008
I'll get your electric blanket.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.012
Kramer, I can't get
that many Wizards.

18:09.188 --> 18:11.281
-What about your deal?
-I didn't have a deal.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.254
They're $200 a pop. What do I do?

18:13.425 --> 18:14.756
Don't worry. I know a guy.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.521
-Down here?
-Yeah. Bob Saccamano's father.

18:19.631 --> 18:22.794
And that leads
into the master bedroom.

18:22.968 --> 18:24.435
Tell us more.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.503
Wanna hear more?

18:27.439 --> 18:29.873
The master bedroom
opens into the solarium.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.738
-Another solarium?
-Yes, two solariums.

18:32.911 --> 18:34.538
Quite a find.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.712
-And I have horses too.
-What are their names?

18:42.554 --> 18:44.954
Snoopy and Prickly Pete.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.759
Should I keep driving?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.225
Oh, look, an antique stand.

18:51.396 --> 18:54.263
Pull over. We'll buy you
a housewarming gift.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.828
A housewarming gift.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.967
All right, we're taking it up a notch.

19:04.743 --> 19:07.371
-Long day?
-Yeah, I just worked a triple shift.

19:07.579 --> 19:09.240
I hear you, sister.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.210
-Sister?
-Yeah.

19:11.383 --> 19:14.181
It's okay. My boyfriend's black.
Here he is. See?

19:14.353 --> 19:16.287
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hey.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.423
-He's black?
-Yeah.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.416
-I'm black?
-Aren't you?

19:22.594 --> 19:25.324
I'll give you a couple
of minutes to decide.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.067
-What are you talking about?
-You're black.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.997
You said we were
an interracial couple.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.502
We are because you're Hispanic.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.500
-I am?
-Aren't you?

19:39.678 --> 19:41.509
No. Why would you think that?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.978
Your name's Benes. Your hair.

19:44.149 --> 19:46.413
You kept taking me
to those Spanish restaurants.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.120
That's because I thought
you were black.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.715
Why would you take me to a Spanish
restaurant because I'm black?

19:54.226 --> 19:56.888
I don't think we should
be talking about this.

19:57.062 --> 19:59.189
-So, what are you?
-I'm white.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.925
So we're just a couple
of white people?

20:04.269 --> 20:05.861
I guess.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.565
Yeah.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.810
-So do you want to go to the Gap?
-Sure.

20:17.783 --> 20:20.980
Well, I handed out all the Wizards.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.280
The polls close in one hour.

20:23.455 --> 20:27.016
I think we've got this baby
all sewn up, huh? Yeah.

20:28.293 --> 20:31.228
Yeah, there was an extra one.
Norman Bergerman.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.297
He won't be leaving any tips
where he is.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.058
Congratulations, Mr. President.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.204
Congratulations,
Mr. Puppet Master, huh?

20:39.371 --> 20:42.602
Hey, Morty, what's wrong
with these tip calculators?

20:42.774 --> 20:44.071
What are you talking about?

20:44.243 --> 20:47.508
It's overtipping.
I just left 5 bucks for a BLT.

20:47.679 --> 20:49.738
Let me see that.

20:49.948 --> 20:52.109
This isn't a Wizard. It's a Willard.

20:52.784 --> 20:56.276
It's a Willard?
Saccamano Sr. screwed me.

20:56.455 --> 20:57.979
Mine doesn't have a seven.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.350
I'm ruined.

20:59.524 --> 21:01.617
Jerry, why didn't you get
them Wizards?

21:01.793 --> 21:03.590
Because the real Wizard's $200.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.822
-You didn't have a deal?
-No deal. Not hot.

21:06.999 --> 21:10.526
Morty, you and Kramer.
You're finished.

21:10.702 --> 21:13.535
Everyone vote for the guy
in the wheelchair.

21:13.705 --> 21:16.572
-Let's go.
-The people have spoken.

21:17.509 --> 21:20.205
Well, that's it for me.
I'm heading back to New York.

21:23.582 --> 21:24.810
Dad, I'm sorry.

21:24.983 --> 21:26.007
You should be.

21:26.184 --> 21:29.813
How could you spend $200
on a tip calculator?

21:29.988 --> 21:33.014
It does other things!

21:45.504 --> 21:48.996
-Where are we, George?
-Almost there.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.740
This is the end of Long Island.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.001
Where's your house?

21:54.179 --> 21:57.342
We go on foot from here.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.210
All right.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.958
There's no house! It's a lie!

22:14.132 --> 22:16.965
There's no solarium.
There's no Prickly Pete.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.069
There's no other solarium.

22:19.237 --> 22:20.568
We know.

22:23.108 --> 22:28.410
Then why? Why did you make me
drive all the way out here?

22:28.580 --> 22:34.041
Why didn't you say something?
Why? Why? Why?

22:34.219 --> 22:37.245
We don't like you, George.

22:38.557 --> 22:42.254
And we always blamed you
for what happened to Susan.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.532
All right.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.825
Let's head back.
