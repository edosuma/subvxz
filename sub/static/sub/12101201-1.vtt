WEBVTT

04:06.329 --> 04:07.163
- Very sensitive.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.039
- Yes.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.601
- Miss Marmalade.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.604
First of all, I'd like
to reintroduce ourselves.

04:31.646 --> 04:35.149
My name is Mr. Bartholomew,
and this is Mr. Toboggan

04:35.191 --> 04:36.192
and we're of the law firm

04:36.192 --> 04:38.236
of Toboggan, Toboggan, and Toboggan.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.613
Your grandmother was a very,

04:40.655 --> 04:42.615
very important client of the firm.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.534
Isn't that right, Mr. Toboggan?

04:44.534 --> 04:47.078
We're here because she has willed you

04:47.078 --> 04:49.205
this condo in its entirety.

04:49.205 --> 04:53.418
Every little thing that you
see paid for is now yours

04:53.459 --> 04:57.046
for your entire lifetime until
God forbid you should die

04:57.046 --> 05:00.300
or I should say pass
away of natural causes.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.469
All you've got to do is sign the contract.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.430
Should we show her the
agreement, Mr. Toboggan?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.223
Please, please.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.225
Right here, right here.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.442
Mr. Toboggan, would you please
place the contract down?

05:19.068 --> 05:21.112
If you would be just so
kind to sign the contract

05:21.154 --> 05:23.531
and don't read any of the small detail.

05:23.531 --> 05:26.075
Mr. Toboggan is an expert
in this I promise you

05:26.326 --> 05:27.160
and he's a notary.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.619
He will witness your signature.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.621
Whoa, whoa, one second.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.873
Don't sign the contract just yet.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.041
I forgot to tell her

05:33.041 --> 05:36.044
about the supplemental
part of the contract.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.587
- Don't look at them in the eye.

05:37.587 --> 05:41.257
- Your grandmother was very,
very emphatic about one thing.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.301
And I'd like to take you on this adventure

05:43.301 --> 05:45.261
about your grandmother
that maybe you didn't know

05:45.261 --> 05:46.429
or maybe you did know.

05:46.929 --> 05:51.934
From every country from
Armenia to India to Sri Lanka

05:52.268 --> 05:54.645
and she loved these dolls.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.314
I mean, look at the beauty of these dolls.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.523
The faces.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.568
She loved them like they
were her own children.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.488
And there's a stipulation
now in the agreement

06:03.529 --> 06:05.907
that you must look after these dolls

06:05.948 --> 06:08.117
as though they were your own.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.536
Mr. Toboggan, would you
please come sit down?

06:10.536 --> 06:12.163
It is not only a contractual,

06:12.163 --> 06:14.248
but it's a spiritual obligation.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.376
And if anything was to happen,

06:16.376 --> 06:18.961
you must get in touch with
the master doll maker.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.088
The card, please.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.048
He's available 24 seven.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.425
You must get in contact immediately

06:24.425 --> 06:27.220
if anything was to happen and
I mean anything whatsoever.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.054
Please take that.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.515
It's an emergency
telephone number 24 seven.

06:30.515 --> 06:34.727
You call this number and
let me explain to you why.

06:34.727 --> 06:35.770
You see the dolls?

06:36.979 --> 06:38.731
You see how lifelike the dolls are?

06:39.357 --> 06:40.191
They look real.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.111
They are so perfect.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.028
Every little.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.571
Look at the nose.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.448
Oh, you cute little doll.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.200
What about the lips?

06:52.995 --> 06:53.830
Right?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.040
Do you love these dolls the way

06:56.040 --> 06:58.292
your grandmother loved these dolls?

06:58.292 --> 06:59.544
That's important.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.796
If you can love the dolls the way

07:01.796 --> 07:03.756
your grandmother loved the dolls,

07:03.756 --> 07:06.426
Mr. Toboggan and I are prepared

07:06.426 --> 07:08.678
to watch you sign that contract

07:08.678 --> 07:13.015
and all of this and every
doll in it is yours.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.351
- Just don't look at them in the eyes.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.602
- Are you ready for that?

07:17.812 --> 07:18.896
Sign the contract.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.237
Can we give her the keys now?

07:29.031 --> 07:32.368
The key is now yours.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.165
- Congratulations.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.417
- And with that said, I
think we better get going.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.003
It was great meeting you, Miss Marmalade.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.172
We're gonna leave this with you.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.548
I know you're gonna be very happy

07:45.548 --> 07:46.841
and you'll never be lonely.

07:46.841 --> 07:47.800
We should get going.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.718
- Congratulations.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.680
- Just call the doll maker.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.764
- Careful, they bite.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.018
- What are you saying
something like that for?

07:57.018 --> 07:58.728
I mean, that's stupid.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.637
You behave yourself

08:32.637 --> 08:34.222
and we'll get along just fine.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.640
It shall take forever

10:40.640 --> 10:42.099
for me to name you all.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.227
Longer for me to remember.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.482
Let's see.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.025
Who will sleep with me tonight?

10:54.487 --> 10:58.908
I'm still a virgin, which
means no funny business

10:59.075 --> 11:00.409
and tell no one.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.410
You hear me?

11:01.410 --> 11:04.455
All I need to be is a
laughingstock of my peers.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.877
There, sweet face.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.756
My name is Adeline.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.133
I don't know the new language very well

11:16.133 --> 11:17.968
and I don't have any friends.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.304
I feel that I have never fit in

11:20.304 --> 11:22.264
with the people of this new world,

11:22.640 --> 11:26.018
but my dad says soon it
will be better than home.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.019
We are free here.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.154
Now don't be jealous.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.907
That's not an attribute to be proud of.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.203
We have tomorrow night
and the rest of my life

11:44.829 --> 11:47.540
till I pass away peacefully
by natural causes.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.042
Goodnight.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.465
I'm so sorry, Adeline.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.925
I cry myself to sleep every night

12:40.009 --> 12:41.385
since I merely turned girl.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.013
God only knows why.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.758
- This file is on a slingshot.

13:26.388 --> 13:29.850
Ae you going to introduce me?

13:30.351 --> 13:31.185
Kenneth doesn't

13:31.185 --> 13:33.562
appreciate your sarcasm, Dr. Feverheart.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.564
Even though it just a doll.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.651
- I can see that.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.695
What?

13:41.695 --> 13:44.740
That he doesn't like your
sarcasm or that he's just a doll?

13:45.324 --> 13:47.576
- How have you been feeling, Marmalade?

13:48.953 --> 13:49.912
Same.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.706
- And last night?

13:54.041 --> 13:58.754
Have you given any more thought
to the idea of medication?

13:58.754 --> 13:59.547
No.

14:00.798 --> 14:04.593
- You do realize you are
biting the nails of Kenneth.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.095
Sorry.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.764
You seem to care more about
Kenneth than you do me.

14:14.061 --> 14:21.360
- Subliminal hunger
manifested in nail biting.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.988
That's not true.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.740
Hey, he's only made of clay.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.493
You are a living being.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.414
Well, you
could have fooled me.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.751
- Perhaps I should make out
the medication to Kenneth.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.212
Not funny.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.100
How time flies.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.895
- Well you wanted our session
time to be cut in half.

14:55.895 --> 14:56.770
Well, yes.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.814
I want to win myself.

14:58.814 --> 15:02.943
- In case you or Kenneth
change your minds.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.739
You may
need a doc more than me.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.616
- I'll see you next week at two.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.119
2:17.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.579
She can wait.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.755
Can you imagine that?

15:23.255 --> 15:26.800
Bad enough doc is
offering me drugs but you?

15:34.600 --> 15:35.434
Oops.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.448
If grandmother saw
that, I'd lose a candle.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.012
Don't you dare.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.764
We can fall out the window.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.217
You hear that, Cosmo?

19:32.713 --> 19:33.797
An electrical outage

19:33.797 --> 19:35.632
has just struck the metropolitan area

19:35.632 --> 19:37.467
with a 100,000 left in the dark.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.929
Spokeswoman for water and power

19:40.929 --> 19:43.348
is blaming a main power
generator that went out.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.602
If not
one thing, it's another.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.634
Nothing to fear.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.260
Only an electrical outage.

20:23.305 --> 20:26.308
I wonder who will sleep with me tonight?

20:57.839 --> 21:00.634
Esmee of Holland, land of windmills.

21:00.634 --> 21:01.343
Nice to meet you.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.063
How gallant and striking you must look

21:13.063 --> 21:15.565
with your beautiful wheat colored hair

21:15.565 --> 21:17.526
blowing in the wayward winds.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.071
Those wayward winds.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.185
Bonjour, Gilbert.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.062
Marmalade.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.356
You know how many messages I left you?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.065
How many?

22:38.440 --> 22:39.191
10.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.734
Be thankful
this didn't turn out

22:40.734 --> 22:42.402
to be number 11.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.321
What do you want?

22:44.696 --> 22:45.989
What I always want.

22:46.573 --> 22:47.074
To see you.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.952
I'm in a phase, Gilbert.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.871
And maybe a little respect.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.415
When you
die, I'll pay my respects.

22:55.665 --> 22:56.958
Oh geez.

22:57.751 --> 22:58.752
Did you join the dark side?

22:59.086 --> 23:00.087
Yes, Gilbert.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.927
So why do you love me so much?

23:08.303 --> 23:09.346
That smile.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.764
You'll be sticking a knife in my back

23:10.764 --> 23:14.267
but that smile makes me think,
gosh, she didn't mean it.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.815
Gilbert, I
haven't smiled forever.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.108
Oh, I can wait.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.234
How sweet.

23:23.777 --> 23:24.653
It's Thursday.

23:24.653 --> 23:25.529
I can drive you.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.448
That wouldn't
count as conservation day.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.867
You'd be spilling gas
into the environment.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.537
I'm taking the bus like every Thursday.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.205
Well, I can
ride with you on the bus.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.042
Not today, Gilbert.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.210
I'm in a phase.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.336
We can take the bus ride

23:41.336 --> 23:42.879
when you're finished with your homework.

23:42.879 --> 23:43.547
Goodbye.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.548
Wait.

23:44.756 --> 23:45.590
Too late.

23:45.590 --> 23:46.383
I hung up already.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.467
No, you didn't.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.336
Excuse me.

24:23.336 --> 24:25.589
I'm looking for this address,
but there doesn't seem

24:25.589 --> 24:30.135
to be a 7575 Plus One
Quarter Forgotten Street.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.137
- It's that Forgotten Street.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.306
In there?

24:36.433 --> 24:37.726
Don't like this too much.

24:53.658 --> 24:57.746
Cosmo, what kind of doll fixer
could reside in an alleyway?

24:58.246 --> 24:59.956
- The homeless kind.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.082
That's who.

25:04.127 --> 25:05.712
You dropped something there, dolly.

25:05.754 --> 25:06.713
Come on in here.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.589
Come on in here.

25:07.631 --> 25:08.965
Come on, I'll take a look at that.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.385
Now Cosmo's
broken in two ways.

25:12.385 --> 25:13.595
- Three ways.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.722
You ain't accounting for his broken heart.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.560
Know all the pass codes
to the neighborhood.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.686
Don't tell nobody.

25:21.686 --> 25:24.564
Now, come on inside and I'll have a look.

25:24.814 --> 25:25.649
Come on.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.443
How do you
know he has a broken heart?

25:28.443 --> 25:30.779
- Every doll has a broken heart.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.198
Don't you know they all wanna be human?

25:33.198 --> 25:35.116
Now, come on inside here, doll face.

25:35.575 --> 25:37.118
Come on, come on.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.794
Let me have a look.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.213
Let me have a.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.047
Let.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.090
Come.

25:50.090 --> 25:51.216
Please be careful.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.759
You've done enough damage.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.512
- There's no damage I can't fix.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.354
Do you like the new artwork?

26:05.021 --> 26:06.189
- Course I like the artwork.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.232
I designed it.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.069
You're the doll fixer?

26:11.278 --> 26:13.446
- What do you think we're doing
here? Meeting for my health?

26:27.210 --> 26:28.837
Say, I have seen worse.

26:29.963 --> 26:30.797
Cosmo.

26:31.798 --> 26:32.716
You're gonna live.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.554
Tell me what's your name, doll face?

26:37.721 --> 26:38.847
Marmalade.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.240
- Doll face, go down the block.

26:57.490 --> 26:58.617
Take a left.

26:58.658 --> 26:59.868
Hank's Cafe.

26:59.868 --> 27:00.869
Two lattes.

27:00.869 --> 27:03.038
Fixing time is one half hour.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.002
Shoo.

27:09.002 --> 27:10.629
You can't watch me while I do my magic.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.339
Go, go, shoo, shoo.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.340
Two lattes.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.091
I don't want a latte.

27:15.425 --> 27:19.638
- Two lattes for me, doll
face, and with soy milk.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.556
Got to look out for them cows.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.974
Now move along.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.976
Move along.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.883
Had a hard time holding
up still, but I managed.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.052
Two out of the three fixed.

27:59.052 --> 27:59.761
Okay.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.472
Still got that broken heart though.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.224
Afraid that one's out of my league.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.269
You never
know he was broken.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.857
Did you know my grandmother Estelle?

28:12.857 --> 28:14.359
- You look just like her.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.027
Both doll faces.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.658
Thank you so much.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.284
I could have lost everything.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.537
- And been homeless like myself.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.579
Don't advise that.

28:28.164 --> 28:29.749
How much do I owe you?

28:30.375 --> 28:32.252
- All in the contract.

28:33.962 --> 28:34.796
What contract?

28:35.130 --> 28:36.756
- The one I signed with your grandmother.

28:38.925 --> 28:42.095
Okay, does it for me.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.597
I'll be moseying on my way now.

28:44.597 --> 28:46.975
Gonna freshen my supplies.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.101
Nice seeing you.

28:50.353 --> 28:52.856
Ever hear
of a doll hanging himself?

28:54.482 --> 29:00.488
- Old wives tales, spooky
fairy tales and legends.

29:00.780 --> 29:01.573
Why?

29:02.866 --> 29:05.034
One of grandmother's dolls.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.119
- Damn.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.912
Spunkneck curse.

29:07.912 --> 29:08.621
Huh?

29:10.540 --> 29:13.293
- Thought it was cast
out when he hung himself.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.128
Who hung himself?

29:15.378 --> 29:18.590
- Spunkneck, the demented doll maker.

29:22.802 --> 29:26.181
I was doing good, but curses like this

29:26.181 --> 29:28.057
drop me from the wagon.

29:31.936 --> 29:32.520
Sorry, kid.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.608
I don't normally make house calls.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.736
If it gets any worse, you call me.

29:43.281 --> 29:44.324
Worse?

29:44.491 --> 29:46.284
Another hanging.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.847
Keep the faith.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.160
Hey, Tanechka, you look nice and warm.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.496
It's your turn.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.019
Come here.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.105
No.

31:39.105 --> 31:42.317
Come here, come here.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.152
Thank you for
seeing me spur of the moment.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.612
I was beside myself.

33:10.029 --> 33:11.155
- Yeah.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.825
There's nothing I can detect
that's out of the ordinary.

33:14.325 --> 33:17.996
Although I am gonna recommend
that you check yourself

33:17.996 --> 33:22.166
into a hospital for complete
and comprehensive evaluation.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.334
I'm fine.

33:24.752 --> 33:27.046
- Seeing dolls that hang themselves.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.589
Haven't
you ever had a nightmare?

33:29.215 --> 33:30.299
- Was it a nightmare?

33:34.345 --> 33:36.389
Tell me what you see.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.236
A real doll.

33:50.486 --> 33:51.571
- Real or not?

33:54.365 --> 33:55.199
Real.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.200
Real doll.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.119
- This is a patient of mine.

33:58.202 --> 34:01.456
I thought it might be helpful
for the two of you to meet.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.541
Who applied his makeup?

34:03.666 --> 34:05.001
- You can talk directly to me.

34:07.086 --> 34:10.089
Oh, who applies your makeup?

34:10.173 --> 34:11.591
- I only talk when I'm winded up.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.178
- Go through the motions.

34:24.103 --> 34:24.937
That's it.

34:25.938 --> 34:26.856
Keep winding.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.649
Wind him all the way up.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.819
Wind him all the way up.

34:44.373 --> 34:45.124
Hurry.

34:45.124 --> 34:46.417
The syringe on the table.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.044
Marmalade, the syringe.

34:48.044 --> 34:48.878
Hurry.

34:49.504 --> 34:50.338
- Ah.

35:00.014 --> 35:01.432
- Sorry.

35:01.766 --> 35:05.603
It's part of the master
manifesto I was reading about

35:05.603 --> 35:09.649
belonging to the brilliant
psychiatrist Luberg Pillowski

35:09.649 --> 35:11.901
dating back to the last century.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.402
I just thought the procedure

35:13.402 --> 35:16.239
would be beneficial to both of you.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.949
Your therapy's deadly.

35:17.949 --> 35:21.077
You're associating my condition
with this psycho maniac.

35:21.077 --> 35:23.704
- There are similarities.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.456
The only similarity

35:25.456 --> 35:27.583
is your twisted thinking to his.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.127
You're fired.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.045
- I wouldn't recommend that.

35:33.714 --> 35:34.841
I wouldn't either.

35:34.924 --> 35:35.925
Silly girl.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.971
Marmalade.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.141
Therapy is still in session.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.488
- Think if I leave my cart out here,

35:57.488 --> 35:58.698
anyone's gonna steal it?

35:59.115 --> 36:01.659
Okay, it's only whole life belongings.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.088
Okay, where's the scoundrel?

36:16.048 --> 36:18.217
Where are the scoundrels?

36:18.217 --> 36:19.927
Where are the scoundrels?

36:20.386 --> 36:25.224
Ah, I see.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.143
Aren't
you going to pick it up?

36:27.685 --> 36:29.061
- I ain't gonna touch him.

36:29.061 --> 36:32.565
Leave my prints, be falsely
accused and get life.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.192
It's only a doll.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.195
- Mm hm.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.614
Ones that hang themselves.

36:42.325 --> 36:46.787
But it's what they might
do that concerns me more.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.831
What else?

36:48.831 --> 36:53.461
- Those legends, the spooky
legends, fairy tales,

36:54.253 --> 36:57.673
old wives tale spoke of cruel atrocities.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.218
Do you have a plan?

37:00.259 --> 37:01.510
- Do have a plan.

37:02.637 --> 37:03.888
Find the headmaster.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.353
What are you doing?

37:11.479 --> 37:12.313
- Ah.

37:13.231 --> 37:18.236
This has a theoretically indefinite pitch

37:18.277 --> 37:23.741
when rung in the ear of the headmaster.

37:30.498 --> 37:31.540
Found the maestro.

37:32.291 --> 37:33.501
Come here.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.169
Come over here.

37:36.921 --> 37:37.755
Take this paper.

37:38.714 --> 37:39.548
Hold it up.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.052
All right.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.265
What's it say?

37:50.309 --> 37:52.603
Spunkneck's curse coming.

37:54.981 --> 37:55.815
Oh my God.

37:55.815 --> 37:56.857
What does it mean?

37:57.525 --> 37:58.859
- As in the dream state

37:59.860 --> 38:02.238
where time is different
than the waking state.

38:03.322 --> 38:07.576
So to is time in the world of dolls

38:07.702 --> 38:11.455
for sure in the world of Spunkneck dolls.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.999
I think you're scaring me.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.417
- Hold on.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.752
It gets worse.

38:16.877 --> 38:22.550
Once normally harmless, inanimate,

38:22.967 --> 38:27.972
rubber, porcelain, marbled
eyed dolls turned wicked

38:28.597 --> 38:31.642
when the headmaster doll maker Spunkneck

38:31.642 --> 38:34.729
fell to the dark side
stemming from childhood abuse,

38:34.729 --> 38:36.731
which he could no longer keep contained.

38:37.231 --> 38:40.443
And so his evil desire to spoil

38:40.443 --> 38:43.946
little happy innocent boys and girls.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.699
I haven't seen jealousy.

38:48.826 --> 38:49.660
He felt cheated.

38:50.953 --> 38:55.374
And so he jinxed his future
creations with a dark spell.

38:55.374 --> 38:59.086
Doomsday internal clocks
so that each and every doll

38:59.086 --> 39:01.505
would enact its own horror doomsday.

39:03.090 --> 39:04.759
Doll Armageddon.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.385
- Find another place to sleep.

39:07.762 --> 39:08.804
I will not.

39:08.846 --> 39:11.682
And I inherited these
dolls from my grandmother.

39:12.099 --> 39:14.935
They're like my little
brothers and sisters.

39:16.270 --> 39:18.856
- Made from the dark side.

39:20.983 --> 39:23.361
I can't abort them.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.487
- That's your own peril.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.698
We all innocent inside.

39:27.698 --> 39:30.576
Just need to be loved
and given the chance.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.745
- Just like your grandmother.

39:32.912 --> 39:33.746
Heart of gold.

39:35.164 --> 39:37.375
Tell my
wannabe boyfriend that.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.543
- He don't sound like the one.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.420
Let may tell you there's a time for love

39:41.420 --> 39:43.422
and a time for wise resolution.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.302
Look at that.

39:48.302 --> 39:49.136
My cart's still here.

39:49.345 --> 39:50.638
.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.976
Chains as strong as its weakest link.

43:57.009 --> 43:59.386
Take me to the lights.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.638
- What lights?

44:00.638 --> 44:01.472
Any lights.

44:01.472 --> 44:02.556
Just lights.

44:02.556 --> 44:03.891
- Are you afraid of dark?

44:03.891 --> 44:05.184
Lately, yes.

44:49.728 --> 44:51.188
- I should take you home now.

44:53.023 --> 44:55.025
Yes, you can take me home.

47:28.178 --> 47:29.388
Please, grandmother.

47:29.388 --> 47:31.932
Don't let anything happen to me.

47:31.932 --> 47:32.766
Happen to me.

47:33.267 --> 47:34.476
Happen to me.

49:00.270 --> 49:01.813
What the fuck?

49:26.129 --> 49:27.506
Marmalade.

49:28.090 --> 49:31.468
Either I'm dead and dreaming
and you're dead and dreaming.

49:31.468 --> 49:33.845
Can you just talk with me for a while?

49:34.221 --> 49:35.138
Geez.

49:35.555 --> 49:37.557
What's wrong, Marmalade?

49:38.642 --> 49:39.226
Nothing.

49:39.226 --> 49:40.185
I just need to talk.

49:40.852 --> 49:42.562
Yeah, sure.

49:42.562 --> 49:44.147
We can talk forever if you want.

49:44.398 --> 49:45.148
Gilbert.

49:46.441 --> 49:47.234
Yeah.

49:48.443 --> 49:50.946
You know I
inherited my grandmother condo.

49:51.571 --> 49:54.282
God knows when
you're going to invite me over.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.576
Well, you
know, it's filled with dolls.

49:56.785 --> 49:57.661
Told me that.

49:57.869 --> 49:59.371
I haven't been well.

49:59.538 --> 50:02.207
What if I told you I
just feel like screaming?

50:05.293 --> 50:06.795
Well, go ahead.

51:13.111 --> 51:14.321
Good witch.

51:14.404 --> 51:17.074
You're going to protect
me from any evil curses.

51:17.074 --> 51:17.824
Won't you?

51:21.078 --> 51:22.287
Will you?

51:27.793 --> 51:29.795
Strange things to say the least

51:29.795 --> 51:32.923
have been taking place
with grandmother's dolls.

51:32.923 --> 51:35.383
Sometimes I think I'm going nuts.

51:35.383 --> 51:36.259
Okay.

51:36.259 --> 51:37.469
Do your magic.

51:37.469 --> 51:40.180
Bless you and bless this place.

51:42.265 --> 51:43.975
It's a gloomy day.

51:43.975 --> 51:46.561
Marmalade, don't be depressed.

51:50.190 --> 51:51.650
No, not you.

51:53.985 --> 51:56.363
I know none of you wish me any harm.

51:56.363 --> 51:58.365
You're all dealing with your own pain.

51:58.490 --> 52:00.367
I know how hard it is sometimes.

52:00.408 --> 52:02.160
I'm not aborting you.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.620
I just have to get some air.

52:17.926 --> 52:19.261
One, two, three.

52:19.344 --> 52:22.180
Four, five, six.

52:22.180 --> 52:25.475
Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

52:26.476 --> 52:29.688
9,999.

52:31.481 --> 52:32.315
10,000.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.318
Too many cars.

55:05.260 --> 55:07.762
That was so much fun.

55:07.762 --> 55:09.597
We did a great show tonight.

55:09.597 --> 55:12.183
The audience wants an encore but remember.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.271
Always leave them wanting more.

55:16.521 --> 55:17.689
I feel good now.

55:17.689 --> 55:20.942
I think I'll be able to
get a good night's sleep.

55:20.942 --> 55:21.776
Goodnight.

55:39.085 --> 55:39.919
Ugh.

55:40.128 --> 55:41.629
What's that smell?

56:51.491 --> 56:53.618
Goodnight, Rose Burlesque.

57:20.895 --> 57:22.772
Come up and see me some time.

57:22.772 --> 57:24.023
We're having a grand old time in here.

57:24.023 --> 57:25.900
We're drinking whiskey and wine

57:25.900 --> 57:27.360
and we're dancing the night away.

57:27.360 --> 57:29.904
Come make yourself comfortable.

57:29.904 --> 57:31.156
My knee behind my shoulder.

57:31.156 --> 57:34.451
I just get stuck in a
pretzel and it's oh my.

57:34.451 --> 57:36.494
Kicking my feet, I got
a rip in my stockings.

57:36.494 --> 57:38.079
I gotta be more careful.

57:38.079 --> 57:39.247
We're above the law.

57:40.623 --> 57:42.792
Up here is rather stimulating.

57:42.792 --> 57:45.712
I got to say I'm feeling
quite ladylike at this moment.

57:58.850 --> 58:00.226
I need your advice.

58:00.393 --> 58:02.228
You're both older and wiser.

58:02.228 --> 58:03.480
What is wrong with me?

58:09.903 --> 58:11.779
I guess you can't hear me.

58:11.946 --> 58:14.240
You're in your own lovely world.

58:17.368 --> 58:18.870
Thanks anyway.

58:28.296 --> 58:30.507
I thought it might help if we all got

58:30.507 --> 58:32.258
to know each other a little better.

58:33.218 --> 58:35.553
Tell each other our world.

58:35.553 --> 58:36.888
Vent so to speak.

58:37.347 --> 58:40.433
It's such a terrible thing
when one feels so bad

58:40.433 --> 58:42.185
that they feel there is no way out

58:42.185 --> 58:44.103
besides doing away with oneself.

58:44.896 --> 58:45.772
So sad.

58:46.731 --> 58:48.107
I understand.

58:48.274 --> 58:50.652
You'd rather not let
everyone know your business.

58:50.652 --> 58:53.404
Well, just know ever you feel like it,

58:53.404 --> 58:54.822
you can confide in me.

58:54.822 --> 58:56.074
I won't say a word.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.036
I'm going to try to sleep now.

1:01:26.265 --> 1:01:28.726
Sh, they're out there.

1:01:31.312 --> 1:01:34.190
Show us your omnipresence.

1:01:35.066 --> 1:01:37.735
Oh, it's surrounding our bodies.

1:01:39.278 --> 1:01:43.741
We besiege you to grace
us with your presence

1:01:43.741 --> 1:01:45.910
in any shape or form.

1:02:06.848 --> 1:02:10.101
I think it's clear.

1:04:05.007 --> 1:04:06.425
- You okay, miss?

1:04:29.156 --> 1:04:31.075
You want me to call a doctor, miss?

1:04:32.201 --> 1:04:34.370
They can't help me.

1:04:34.620 --> 1:04:36.372
Nobody can help me.

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:21.459
I tried.

1:05:21.459 --> 1:05:22.960
I really tried.

1:06:14.845 --> 1:06:16.973
Whoever
finds this note first,

1:06:17.890 --> 1:06:20.518
let it be kept for my lawyers.

1:06:20.559 --> 1:06:24.105
I leave everything to my
granddaughter Marmalade.

1:06:24.355 --> 1:06:26.107
That sweet child.

1:06:26.107 --> 1:06:28.901
My husband passed away a few years ago.

1:06:29.986 --> 1:06:32.863
It's been so lonely and unbearable

1:06:32.905 --> 1:06:35.157
that I no longer have
the will to continue.

1:06:36.242 --> 1:06:38.119
My heart is empty.

1:06:38.202 --> 1:06:43.165
I leave this condo and all
my beloved dolls to Marmalade

1:06:43.457 --> 1:06:46.252
for her to enjoy as I have.

1:06:47.253 --> 1:06:50.089
Please do not tell her of my suicide

1:06:50.089 --> 1:06:52.508
for it would make her so sad.

1:06:52.508 --> 1:06:56.971
Let her think I passed
away by natural causes.

1:06:56.971 --> 1:07:00.057
My wish for her is to find the love

1:07:00.057 --> 1:07:02.560
and hope that I have lost.

1:07:03.144 --> 1:07:04.353
Goodbye.

1:07:16.866 --> 1:07:18.868
It's quite
brilliant, I must say.

1:07:19.243 --> 1:07:21.495
Quantum algorithms creating

1:07:21.495 --> 1:07:24.623
possibly their own virtual realities.

1:07:26.417 --> 1:07:27.585
- Thank you, doc.

1:07:28.544 --> 1:07:32.965
You give a plant water and
sunlight, it will grow.

1:07:34.383 --> 1:07:37.803
You give structure enough
room for evolution,

1:07:37.803 --> 1:07:39.055
it will grow, too.

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:40.222
- And grow it has.

1:07:40.222 --> 1:07:45.019
Spunkneck, your latest
dolls are full human size.

1:07:45.019 --> 1:07:46.562
- Sure.

1:07:46.562 --> 1:07:49.273
The size has grown with consciousness.

1:07:49.273 --> 1:07:50.941
Take Marmalade for example.

1:07:53.110 --> 1:07:55.738
Marmalade easily frightened.

1:07:56.405 --> 1:07:57.823
Must be taken care of.

1:07:57.823 --> 1:08:00.367
Her kindly grandmother has
left her a condo of dolls

1:08:00.367 --> 1:08:04.205
to keep her company as she
learns to live with her fears.

1:08:04.830 --> 1:08:06.582
Come on, let me show you this one.

1:08:17.218 --> 1:08:20.721
Gilbert, a bother to Marmalade,

1:08:20.721 --> 1:08:23.557
and she doesn't have the
hesitation to show it.

1:08:23.682 --> 1:08:25.267
He loves her no matter what.

1:08:25.267 --> 1:08:27.103
Eventually they will wed.

1:08:28.229 --> 1:08:30.314
- So what's the mysterious ingredient?

1:08:30.314 --> 1:08:31.649
- How so?

1:08:31.774 --> 1:08:34.151
- Labs all around the
world have come close

1:08:34.151 --> 1:08:36.612
to creating a self
perpetuating virtual reality,

1:08:36.612 --> 1:08:38.030
but all of them have failed.

1:08:39.740 --> 1:08:40.741
- Love.

1:08:41.826 --> 1:08:43.744
Love will give them a chance.

1:08:45.162 --> 1:08:46.539
How have you been feeling?

1:08:46.539 --> 1:08:47.414
- Good.

1:08:47.623 --> 1:08:50.793
Leave the past in the past
if the past don't help.

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:51.961
- I gotta remember that one.

1:08:53.045 --> 1:08:57.049
- You know, sometimes a
curse can be a blessing.

1:08:59.009 --> 1:09:00.553
How much I owe you?

1:09:00.553 --> 1:09:02.930
- This one's on the house.

1:09:03.097 --> 1:09:04.348
Aloha.

1:09:21.949 --> 1:09:24.201
Move or die.

1:09:24.493 --> 1:09:27.580
These lines on the road
are hypnotizing me.

1:09:27.580 --> 1:09:29.123
I feel like painting over them.

1:09:31.542 --> 1:09:34.712
Time is money and you're
costing me a fortune, slowpokes.

1:09:35.796 --> 1:09:37.756
This is giving me anxiety.

1:09:40.885 --> 1:09:43.512
Do you have your stick
shift in reverse gear?

1:09:43.512 --> 1:09:45.181
Short seems like it.

1:09:46.307 --> 1:09:49.351
Where did you learn to drive?

1:09:50.603 --> 1:09:52.021
I'm going to invent my most

1:09:52.021 --> 1:09:54.273
sinister doll ever because of you.

1:09:57.109 --> 1:09:59.486
Horse and buggy would be faster.

1:09:59.486 --> 1:10:01.614
This is giving me anxiety.

1:10:02.698 --> 1:10:04.575
This is giving me anxiety.

1:10:05.659 --> 1:10:08.329
Is everyone gonna drive
the same time I'm driving?

1:10:08.329 --> 1:10:09.330
What's wrong with them?

1:10:09.330 --> 1:10:12.291
My dolls have better sense than
these moron Sunday drivers.

1:10:13.250 --> 1:10:15.669
I hate looking at these boring buildings.

1:10:15.669 --> 1:10:17.671
Where's the dancing girls?

1:10:19.465 --> 1:10:22.134
I'm going to program my
new dolls to drive cars

1:10:22.134 --> 1:10:24.553
and run you over in the
middle of the night.

1:10:25.596 --> 1:10:27.973
I should have bought a
tractor instead of a small car

1:10:27.973 --> 1:10:30.226
so I can bulldoze over these slowpokes.

1:10:31.352 --> 1:10:33.312
Get out of your cars and go shopping.

1:10:33.312 --> 1:10:34.855
Go buy yourself a doll.

1:10:38.150 --> 1:10:39.401
Move or die.

1:10:40.861 --> 1:10:42.947
Traffic is for people with no life.

1:10:54.708 --> 1:10:58.045
- Your formula is not complete.

1:10:58.045 --> 1:11:01.298
You cannot have love without truth.

1:13:07.466 --> 1:13:09.218
- Don't worry, Estelle.

1:13:09.218 --> 1:13:10.594
I got it covered.

1:13:11.929 --> 1:13:13.555
Love and truth.
