00:31.140 --> 00:36.580
[Note: The character Hyeong Gil is written as Hoon Gil]

00:57.100 --> 00:58.500
Make it wider.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.400
Retractor.

01:10.050 --> 01:11.880
Are… Are you okay, Go Seung Tak?

01:20.260 --> 01:21.760
Give me another retractor.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.009
What's wrong with him?

01:37.009 --> 01:39.340
You got me. He's never been like this.

01:47.950 --> 01:48.890
Get ready to remove.

01:58.300 --> 01:59.400
Done.

01:59.660 --> 02:01.700
The old catheter has been removed.

02:01.700 --> 02:05.540
Now we need to drill a hole and connect it to pulmonary artery.

02:09.610 --> 02:11.110
The key to this operation

02:11.110 --> 02:13.210
is to locate the right ventricle to the catheter.

02:13.210 --> 02:14.080
Here.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.650
You need to find it without touching the internal and external arteries on the left.

02:16.650 --> 02:17.720
What?

02:20.050 --> 02:21.390
It's not what you said before.

02:21.390 --> 02:24.690
Professor, you can do this, right?

02:31.060 --> 02:33.200
Um, yes… sure.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.600
I can do this…

02:36.840 --> 02:38.300
Scalpel.

02:43.180 --> 02:46.079
Then drill a hole around here...

02:46.079 --> 02:50.380
To the right a little. A little more.

02:50.380 --> 02:52.880
Yes. Right there. Good.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.260
Professor Bang will do it personally?

02:59.260 --> 03:02.090
Oh, of course.

03:02.090 --> 03:04.560
The operation should be performed by the chief surgeon.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.530
Right, President?

03:09.400 --> 03:10.770
Give me another one.

03:10.870 --> 03:11.670
That, too.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.150
The hole is drilled.

03:27.150 --> 03:30.820
And now is the most important step, connecting the catheter.

03:34.060 --> 03:37.230
Seung Jo, you know who I am, right?

03:40.100 --> 03:44.500
I promise I'll let you see your mom again.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.110
Suture pliers.

03:51.579 --> 03:54.750
I've never done this kind of operation on a kid.

03:55.910 --> 03:58.780
Hold on. Sew it up at here.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.250
Give me the suture pliers.

04:40.130 --> 04:41.590
[Episode 11]

04:42.330 --> 04:44.730
Where's Seung Jo? Is he gone?

04:44.730 --> 04:48.330
Seung Jo… He's coming.

04:49.770 --> 04:52.070
Doctor.

04:52.070 --> 04:53.870
He said he should be clean when he sees his mom,

04:53.870 --> 04:55.710
so he went to wash his face.

05:01.710 --> 05:05.150
What? You two failed in saving the kid's life again?

05:08.350 --> 05:10.360
The operation went very well.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.990
He should be gone by now.

05:11.990 --> 05:13.290
He should've returned to his body.

05:13.290 --> 05:14.930
Why didn't he? Was there any problem?

05:14.930 --> 05:16.490
I've never seen you like this before.

05:16.490 --> 05:17.560
Like what?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.330
So restless after an operation.

05:19.330 --> 05:20.770
All I've got used to seeing your conceited face.

05:20.770 --> 05:22.100
It was the right place for connecting the catheter.

05:22.100 --> 05:24.270
It pressed against neither the coronary artery

05:24.270 --> 05:25.970
nor the main artery.

05:25.970 --> 05:27.040
You also saw that, right?

05:27.040 --> 05:28.970
His vital signs are stable.

05:28.970 --> 05:30.440
What's the problem then?

05:30.440 --> 05:32.040
The operation was just over.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.280
It'd take some time for him to regain his consciousness.

05:35.010 --> 05:36.780
I'll keep an eye on Seung Jo over there.

05:36.780 --> 05:38.650
And you can take care of this Seung Jo.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.520
Don't worry.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.510
Hey, Go Seung Tak, I heard the operation went smoothly.

06:07.510 --> 06:08.950
Does it mean our mission is accomplished?

06:08.950 --> 06:09.880
How is he doing?

06:09.880 --> 06:12.180
Blood pressure, 110 / 70, pulse is 90,

06:12.180 --> 06:13.180
CVP is 6.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.820
[CVP Central venous pressure]

06:13.180 --> 06:14.150
Everything is fine.

06:14.150 --> 06:16.620
So the operation was successful.

06:16.620 --> 06:18.390
Why? Is there anything we should be worried about?

06:18.390 --> 06:20.260
Well, there's nothing to worry.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.990
He should wake up soon. Very soon.

06:21.990 --> 06:24.530
But it's still too early to be overconfident.

06:24.530 --> 06:25.960
Though the operation went well,

06:25.960 --> 06:28.830
it's still hard to say when he'll wake up.

06:28.830 --> 06:30.030
Then forget about "over", just be confident.

06:30.030 --> 06:31.170
That guy… Oh, no.

06:31.170 --> 06:32.740
Just trust me. Don't you know who I am?

06:32.740 --> 06:34.270
Of course, I know who you are.

06:35.470 --> 06:37.110
Please keep an eye on him.

06:37.110 --> 06:38.840
Call me if there's anything.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.110
Thank you, buddy.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.650
My hands trembled, right in the middle of an operation!

06:45.650 --> 06:47.090
Has this happened to you before, Jeo?

06:47.090 --> 06:48.720
Never.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.360
Then why did it happen to me?

06:51.360 --> 06:52.860
How would I know?

06:52.860 --> 06:55.290
It could be God's will.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.860
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

06:56.860 --> 06:58.400
Neither am I.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.930
And I cannot tell you even if I know.

06:59.930 --> 07:01.530
What if my guess is wrong?

07:01.530 --> 07:03.800
There's a lot of fake news these days.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.300
And…

07:05.300 --> 07:06.670
are the sleeves too short?

07:06.670 --> 07:07.840
Should I fix them?

07:11.240 --> 07:15.280
Why does he always have trouble?

07:15.280 --> 07:18.220
I thought things would go well with him.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.020
Is it because of that?

07:29.860 --> 07:30.860
What's wrong?

07:37.170 --> 07:38.140
What happened?

07:46.140 --> 07:47.580
He said he wanted to get his mom a gift,

07:47.580 --> 07:49.710
yet he chose all the things he likes.

07:49.710 --> 07:53.020
I heard the operation went well. Why is he still here?

07:53.020 --> 07:56.350
Even if the operation went well, it doesn't mean he'll be gone right away.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.060
And there's no example anyway.

07:59.060 --> 08:02.190
How could you say that in front of him?

08:02.190 --> 08:05.960
Exactly. Someone doesn't look so happy.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.770
Why are you all picking on me?

08:29.990 --> 08:31.560
-Seung Jo. -Where's Seung Jo?

08:32.360 --> 08:34.230
Seung Jo is doing well over there.

08:34.230 --> 08:35.690
How about Seung Jo here? Hasn't he gone yet?

08:35.690 --> 08:37.630
I shouldn't have operated.

08:37.630 --> 08:40.059
I should've stopped.

08:40.059 --> 08:41.530
Why do you say that?

08:41.530 --> 08:42.799
Professor Cha! Professor Cha!

08:42.799 --> 08:44.700
Professor Cha! Professor Cha! Professor Cha!

08:48.240 --> 08:50.280
Doctor.

09:03.190 --> 09:09.330
It's okay. Seung Jo will see mom soon.

09:09.930 --> 09:13.500
Will you come with me?

09:16.170 --> 09:18.600
I'll go visit you in the future.

09:18.600 --> 09:24.240
You need to be strong even if you have to go by yourself.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.650
You've washed your face. Don't cry.

09:33.520 --> 09:36.620
Be happy when you see mom.

09:36.620 --> 09:39.390
I'll be with you very soon.

09:39.390 --> 09:42.530
We'll meet in a new way soon.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.630
It's my turn this time. I'll be there first.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.530
The two of them

10:21.530 --> 10:22.730
finally made it.

10:29.910 --> 10:32.510
Seung Jo… Seung Jo…

10:37.820 --> 10:39.350
What? What's wrong?

10:39.350 --> 10:40.650
Has Seung Jo woken up?

10:40.650 --> 10:42.390
Not yet.

10:46.620 --> 10:48.290
Seung Jo, are you awake?

10:49.630 --> 10:50.730
Can you see me?

10:50.730 --> 10:52.260
Do you know who I am?

10:54.270 --> 10:55.630
Great.

10:55.630 --> 10:56.930
Wow, Go Seung Tak.

10:56.930 --> 10:58.540
You said so confidently that Seung Jo would wake up soon.

10:58.540 --> 10:59.100
I didn't expect you to be serious.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.310
Surely I was serious. I did the surgery, okay?

11:01.310 --> 11:02.140
Didn't I tell you

11:02.140 --> 11:03.310
that we could succeed?

11:03.310 --> 11:05.480
Oh, I have such a great brain.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.080
No… It should be my hands.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.510
They should take the credit.

11:08.510 --> 11:11.650
Look, my hands really did a great thing.

11:11.650 --> 11:13.480
Stop showing off.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.450
Oh, right.

11:14.450 --> 11:15.720
I'll get his mother here.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.320
Hi, Seung Jo.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.030
Welcome back to the real world.

11:22.030 --> 11:23.460
You know who I am, right?

11:24.600 --> 11:27.630
Seung Jo, maybe…

11:28.830 --> 11:30.540
Can you still see me?

11:32.370 --> 11:34.840
I'm the only one he can see

11:34.840 --> 11:37.980
and the only one who can touch his hands.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.680
So what?

11:47.650 --> 11:49.150
You're very happy, aren't you?

11:55.090 --> 11:57.760
Are you so glad that he can only see you?

12:16.350 --> 12:17.820
Have you started drinking recently?

12:17.820 --> 12:19.750
No, I don't drink at all.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.820
Or have you been overdoing any exercise?

12:21.820 --> 12:24.360
No, I never exercise.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.560
Follow me and do this.

12:27.090 --> 12:29.160
Why do you suddenly let me do this…?

12:31.030 --> 12:33.000
Go Seung Tak.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.270
Take good care of your body in the future.

12:35.270 --> 12:37.800
Is it worth showing off not to do sports?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.000
Are you a deaf man?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I've told you so many times

12:40.000 --> 12:41.570
that thoracic surgery requires physical strength.

12:42.470 --> 12:45.840
Especially your powerful hands to be proud of.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.110
Don't you know that our hands are our life?

12:48.110 --> 12:50.920
In other words, patients' lives are in your hands.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.920
Even a slight mistake

12:52.920 --> 12:55.620
can put a patient's life in danger, in particular in the OR.

12:55.620 --> 13:00.020
What happened in the operating room?

13:03.290 --> 13:04.860
Right…

13:09.970 --> 13:12.370
Why am I telling you this?

13:12.370 --> 13:14.670
You're not the one who operates anyway.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.240
So…

13:17.240 --> 13:19.140
Are you happy?

13:19.140 --> 13:21.310
Take sleep and wake up to find that the operation is over.

13:21.310 --> 13:23.150
You must be happy to see a patient survive, right?

13:23.150 --> 13:24.880
Another person operates for you

13:24.880 --> 13:26.450
and then you can show off.

13:26.450 --> 13:28.650
You must be happy, right?

13:28.650 --> 13:29.850
Sure…

13:31.090 --> 13:32.620
You are the only one they can see

13:32.620 --> 13:34.290
and the only one who can touch them.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.490
But I am just an invisible man.

13:35.490 --> 13:36.560
There's nothing I can do about anything.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.100
I can do nothing alone.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.400
Only through your hands,

13:41.400 --> 13:43.400
I can do a little…

13:44.900 --> 13:46.970
I wish I could do even a little thing myself.

13:51.310 --> 13:53.440
So listen up.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.610
Try to do some exercise.

13:56.610 --> 13:59.750
Take magnesium supplements on time.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.250
Do you hear me?

14:01.250 --> 14:03.090
Do what I just said.

14:20.540 --> 14:22.310
Alas…

14:22.310 --> 14:25.110
It's time for him to get mad.

14:25.110 --> 14:28.380
The tougher one looks,

14:28.380 --> 14:33.680
the more grief and sorrow he has on the inside.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.190
He has been repressing himself for long.

14:36.190 --> 14:39.520
Unexpectedly, the little boy broke him down.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.590
You…

15:03.310 --> 15:05.050
Why are you still here like this…

15:05.050 --> 15:06.850
Can't you have a good rest

15:08.050 --> 15:10.350
or go outside for fresh air?

15:10.350 --> 15:12.690
Get outside and take a break.

15:13.820 --> 15:15.830
Today is the weekend.

15:27.770 --> 15:31.740
Why are you being so stubborn?

15:34.410 --> 15:37.650
When will you stop being like this?

15:42.990 --> 15:44.890
Please.

15:44.890 --> 15:47.120
Please, Se Jin.

15:48.930 --> 15:52.560
I'm begging you.

15:52.560 --> 15:56.000
When will you stop being like this?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.840
Hello. Patient Lee Ji Woo?

15:57.840 --> 15:59.840
I'll be right there.

16:22.030 --> 16:23.890
Get up.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.670
Wake up now.

16:27.670 --> 16:32.140
Don't lie here like this. Please wake up.

16:32.140 --> 16:35.970
Come on, wake up.

16:37.740 --> 16:40.850
When will things get better?

16:41.810 --> 16:45.080
Okay, enough.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.720
It's enough. Get up!

16:46.720 --> 16:48.190
Get up now!

16:48.190 --> 16:51.090
It's time to wake up.

16:51.090 --> 16:54.530
How many more people do you want to suffer for you?

16:54.530 --> 16:55.830
Wake up!

16:55.830 --> 16:57.830
Please.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.370
It's enough…

17:10.910 --> 17:13.079
Yes, what's wrong?

17:13.079 --> 17:14.910
It's said the boy is having surgery today.

17:14.910 --> 17:15.710
Is it over?

17:15.710 --> 17:18.020
How did it go?

17:18.020 --> 17:20.720
It's over. The operation was successful.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.050
The patient has just woken up.

17:22.050 --> 17:23.190
Really?

17:23.190 --> 17:25.619
Great!

17:25.619 --> 17:27.460
But why do you sound so depressed?

17:27.460 --> 17:29.590
Shouldn't you be dancing with joy?

17:29.590 --> 17:31.430
Yeah.

17:31.430 --> 17:33.500
I was happy until just now.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.530
What's wrong? Anything happened?

17:35.530 --> 17:37.030
It's all right…

17:37.030 --> 17:38.400
I'm just a little tired.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.900
Why are you tired? You did nothing.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.870
The operation…

17:42.940 --> 17:44.910
was done by Professor Cha.

17:47.750 --> 17:50.780
Anyway, it's good news.

17:50.780 --> 17:53.020
Take a break, Go Seung Tak.

17:56.850 --> 18:01.560
Right, I did nothing.

18:03.830 --> 18:06.160
Ma'am.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.830
Did you just get off work?

18:07.830 --> 18:09.330
Yes, what's the matter?

18:09.330 --> 18:11.100
The boy had surgery today.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.100
It was successful.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.240
He has woken up.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.710
You must be happy to hear it.

18:14.710 --> 18:15.640
What?

18:15.640 --> 18:18.080
At that point, a tragedy might happen if it were a little late.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.640
Thank you for finding him in time.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.510
It's such a silver lining.

18:21.510 --> 18:23.410
It was you who saved the kid's life.

18:23.410 --> 18:24.850
Thank you very much.

18:24.850 --> 18:26.380
Me?

18:26.380 --> 18:28.890
I don't understand what you said at all…

18:28.890 --> 18:30.920
You told me that a kid fainted on the ground

18:30.920 --> 18:33.460
and asked me to have a look.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.790
I think you have the wrong person.

18:35.790 --> 18:39.860
I may miss the bus… Goodbye.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.370
It's true.

18:48.370 --> 18:49.810
The background activities

18:49.810 --> 18:52.240
are better than the previous EEG.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.650
Isn't it surprising?

18:54.650 --> 18:57.980
Do you remember the case from three years ago?

18:57.980 --> 19:03.990
The patient who was thought to be releasing the happy hormone we didn't know.

18:58.820 --> 18:59.850
[Neurosurgery Department  Choi * Su]

19:03.990 --> 19:07.660
How long did it take the patient to wake up?

19:07.660 --> 19:10.630
Oh, that's right.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.430
This patient will wake up faster.

19:13.430 --> 19:15.430
I'm sure he will.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.400
Michael, I'll call you later.

19:24.140 --> 19:24.980
You came again.

19:24.980 --> 19:27.040
You always come without telling me in advance.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.980
I didn't find you in the ward.

19:28.980 --> 19:30.080
I've been here for a while.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.750
You were on the phone so you didn't see me.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.790
I'm here to ask if Professor Cha is getting better.

19:34.790 --> 19:36.390
I think I've heard the answer.

19:36.390 --> 19:37.920
As you just heard,

19:37.920 --> 19:40.620
Professor Cha's EEG is doing better markedly.

19:40.620 --> 19:42.160
Now that his EEG has improved,

19:42.160 --> 19:43.890
why hasn't he woken up?

19:43.890 --> 19:47.530
Normally doctors don't believe in miracles.

19:47.530 --> 19:48.700
You mean…

19:48.700 --> 19:50.300
Does it take a miracle for him to wake up?

19:50.300 --> 19:52.940
But some cases I met with occasionally

19:52.940 --> 19:57.010
make me feel that there are unknown areas that humankind can't get in.

19:57.010 --> 20:00.040
Even if  99% of a miracle relies on God's will,

20:00.040 --> 20:04.580
I'm convinced that the remaining 1% requires people's will and sincerity.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.250
Dr. Jang, you are doing your best.

20:07.250 --> 20:10.250
So is Professor Cha.

20:13.020 --> 20:15.230
Sometimes I have this idea.

20:15.230 --> 20:19.560
Maybe he's taking revenge on me this way.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.830
That's why he has built a wall and keeps everyone away from him.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.340
Um, it's not true.

20:24.340 --> 20:26.970
He will get pissed off if he hears it.

20:26.970 --> 20:28.610
He's now in a hurry

20:28.610 --> 20:32.240
to smash through all the walls and get to you.

20:32.240 --> 20:33.540
It's not like what you said.

20:33.540 --> 20:35.410
I can guarantee that.

20:35.410 --> 20:37.380
Why are you so sure?

20:37.380 --> 20:39.920
How can you guarantee that?

20:39.920 --> 20:42.120
What?

20:42.120 --> 20:44.320
You've said it many times.

20:44.320 --> 20:47.990
As if you were him.

20:48.730 --> 20:50.290
Isn't your department busy?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.800
Thank you for being so worried about him.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.270
But you come here several times a day.

20:54.270 --> 20:56.270
Don't you think it's a little too frequent?

20:56.270 --> 20:59.540
If you trust me as his attending physician,

20:59.540 --> 21:03.610
please focus more on your own patients.

21:03.610 --> 21:06.640
It's both a ward and my research room.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.210
I hope in the future you come only when necessary.

21:10.210 --> 21:12.820
Of course, including Secretary Gim.

21:12.820 --> 21:16.490
I think you understand what I mean, right?

21:23.830 --> 21:24.960
What happened?

21:24.960 --> 21:27.670
Why was I attacked in succession?

21:27.670 --> 21:30.100
Have I done something wrong in front of her?

21:30.100 --> 21:33.170
Why did she build walls against me suddenly?

21:34.040 --> 21:35.540
Walls?

21:45.980 --> 21:47.080
That is to say,

21:47.080 --> 21:51.560
there is a man who makes you feel like he's your ex.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.460
Like his words, behaviors, and occasional looks.

21:54.460 --> 21:55.790
He even seems to know

21:55.790 --> 21:57.560
some of your preferences only known to your ex

21:57.560 --> 22:01.100
and the memories from the past of you two.

22:01.100 --> 22:04.270
Am I being too sensitive?

22:04.270 --> 22:06.640
Such cases often appear.

22:06.640 --> 22:09.910
It usually happens to someone who goes through difficult times with us.

22:09.910 --> 22:13.410
Especially when this person is close to the one we care about.

22:13.410 --> 22:15.550
Then we will project our emotions on this person.

22:15.550 --> 22:16.610
Without knowing it,

22:16.610 --> 22:18.880
we may start to rely on this person.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.720
Have you been through a series of events recently

22:21.720 --> 22:24.050
so that you get tired physically and mentally?

22:24.050 --> 22:25.160
If so, it's natural for you

22:25.160 --> 22:27.520
to add meaning to some trivial things

22:27.520 --> 22:31.360
and sometimes even magnify them.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.160
If that's the case…

22:34.630 --> 22:37.170
You might as well keep your distance.

22:37.170 --> 22:38.270
By doing so,

22:38.270 --> 22:41.510
you will be able to quietly feel your heart

22:41.510 --> 22:45.880
and examine the reality calmly.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.380
Walls…

23:26.380 --> 23:28.650
Walls.

23:38.330 --> 23:43.630
In the sound of fallen leaves one day,

23:44.800 --> 23:49.770
I looked through my suddenly empty heart.

23:52.340 --> 23:56.080
Seung Jo came and left. I feel so lost.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.680
Wasn't it said to be three hours yesterday?

23:57.680 --> 23:58.950
But he was just so disobedient.

23:58.950 --> 24:01.790
Kids are all the same.

24:01.790 --> 24:05.020
My son was more naughty at his age.

24:05.020 --> 24:07.160
Do you have a son?

24:08.060 --> 24:11.200
What…? Can't I have a son?

24:11.200 --> 24:16.330
My son, Jin Yeong, must have grown up a lot.

24:22.540 --> 24:26.140
Have we lost it?

24:28.110 --> 24:31.780
Is it too late?

24:31.780 --> 24:33.920
Does the old guy do it on purpose?

24:33.920 --> 24:35.390
Can't he make himself look more graceful?

24:35.390 --> 24:38.960
As long as

24:38.960 --> 24:41.290
we can find the passing years.

24:41.290 --> 24:42.360
You shouldn't have put up with him.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.630
Just call the police.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.070
He's taking the initiative to talk to us now.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.600
What kind of life did he have on earth?

24:50.600 --> 24:55.010
I really live like a fool.

24:55.010 --> 24:55.710
Does anyone of you know

24:55.710 --> 24:58.180
his job when he was still alive?

24:58.180 --> 25:00.410
Ah, well…

25:00.410 --> 25:02.110
I've never asked him.

25:02.110 --> 25:03.750
Why do you want to dig into his past?

Notice
Dear colleagues of the Thoracic Surgery Department,
Thank you for your continued efforts at work.
We are sorry to tell you that due to the issues we are facing, EunSang University Medical Center is having trouble in operating. We'll temporarily suspend the subsidy for the Thoracic Surgery Department. Thank you for your understanding. We'll notify you when the subsidy is reissued again. For details, please contact the Admin Office.
Thank you!]

25:30.270 --> 25:33.380
Why is our department's medical outlay this month cut?

25:33.380 --> 25:35.480
The hospital is not in a very good state recently.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.250
We plan to tighten the financial expenditure.

25:37.250 --> 25:38.880
But that doesn't cost a lot.

No matter how much it costs,

25:40.280 --> 25:41.920
don't you know that many a little makes a mickle?

25:41.920 --> 25:43.620

28:05.230 --> 28:06.300
Go on.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.930
It's better to be something invisible to the naked eye.

28:07.930 --> 28:10.370
For example, in medicine.

Why? It's so late already!

29:49.500 --> 29:50.570
Have some meat.

29:50.570 --> 29:53.040
Don't drink soup all the time.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.400
Oh, that's so refreshing.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.070
Wow, the soup.

29:58.240 --> 30:01.180
You must be sick of this. It doesn't taste good.

30:00.000 --> 30:30.000
[Translated by iQIYI]

30:01.180 --> 30:03.010
So, you'd better wake up soon.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.950
When you wake up, I'll take you to something delicious.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.020
Wow.

30:15.460 --> 30:17.960
So, this is where you live.

30:17.960 --> 30:19.860
What's going on?

30:19.860 --> 30:22.370
What are you doing here?

30:24.030 --> 30:26.540
Oh, Professor Cha.

30:27.140 --> 30:27.900
Go out!

30:27.900 --> 30:29.570
Let's talk outside.

30:29.570 --> 30:31.740
It's not like I don't know him.

30:31.740 --> 30:34.780
I have to say hello.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.910
What are you doing here? You jerk!

30:39.620 --> 30:41.890
Oh, Professor Cha.

30:41.890 --> 30:45.390
What is this? Is it meal time?

30:46.690 --> 30:49.060
It looks like you're eating regular meals.

30:49.060 --> 30:50.730
You look good.

30:50.730 --> 30:52.160
Didn't you hear me tell you to go out?

30:52.160 --> 30:56.730
The proud Jang Se Jin is feeding porridge to this kind of people here.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.640
How come you haven't changed at all from 11 years ago?

30:59.640 --> 31:02.640
How could I not be interested in this guy?

31:02.640 --> 31:05.210
He means the whole world to you.

31:05.880 --> 31:06.810
Hey.

31:06.810 --> 31:08.910
Did he know that?

31:08.910 --> 31:11.250
You went to America because someone

31:11.250 --> 31:14.080
threatened you with him.

31:23.190 --> 31:25.330
Why ninth floor?

31:28.330 --> 31:30.070
I remember what I said back then.

31:30.070 --> 31:34.200
"If you don't want to see his promising career go down the drain,

31:34.740 --> 31:37.340
you're gonna leave Korea."

31:37.340 --> 31:39.540
Did he know about it?

31:39.540 --> 31:42.780
Get out of here before I call someone. Get out now.

31:44.180 --> 31:44.810
Let me see.

31:44.810 --> 31:47.650
Was that hand

31:47.650 --> 31:50.750
left or right?

31:50.750 --> 31:53.390
What are you doing?

32:05.870 --> 32:08.170
Who are you? Don't touch my hand.

32:08.170 --> 32:09.340
Don't touch my hand.

32:09.340 --> 32:10.410
Don't.

32:10.410 --> 32:13.540
No. No. No.

32:20.220 --> 32:22.150
This is all for today.

32:23.020 --> 32:26.490
I hope we'll never meet again.

32:26.490 --> 32:31.330
As a doctor, you need to protect your hands.

32:45.910 --> 32:48.040
What should I use this time?

32:49.580 --> 32:51.480
His hands are useless now anyway.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.150
Right.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.850
Will you be good if he dies?

32:55.850 --> 32:57.850
Do you want me to help you kill him?

33:00.720 --> 33:02.290
Where are you going?

33:02.290 --> 33:04.960
I haven't gotten to the point yet.

33:11.430 --> 33:13.270
Application for restitution of share of estate.

33:13.270 --> 33:17.270
It's not for you though.

33:17.270 --> 33:19.740
You need to transfer it to me when you get it.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.250
You're really funny.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.010
What?

33:24.010 --> 33:26.450
I have no intention of disobeying the President's will.

33:26.450 --> 33:27.620
Even if I sigh it,

33:27.620 --> 33:30.250
I'll transfer it to a passing dog over you.

33:30.250 --> 33:32.320
Judging by what you've done,

33:32.320 --> 33:33.990
you're worse than a dog.

33:33.990 --> 33:35.730
You're not afraid of anything, are you?

33:35.730 --> 33:36.990
That's right.

33:36.990 --> 33:39.630
There's only one thing in the world I'm afraid of right now.

33:39.630 --> 33:42.130
You're lucky I'm not afraid of you.

33:42.130 --> 33:44.070
Get out quietly.

33:44.070 --> 33:47.500
Do you want me to call police or a reporter for you?

33:47.500 --> 33:49.340
-Come on. -Let go.

33:49.340 --> 33:50.770
-Fingerprint. -No.

33:50.770 --> 33:52.010
Press your finger.

33:52.010 --> 33:52.740
Let me go.

33:52.740 --> 33:53.810
No.

33:53.810 --> 33:55.280
Don't do that.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.080
Let go.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.210
No. You jerk!

33:57.210 --> 33:59.350
Let go.

33:59.350 --> 34:01.120
Come on.

34:03.650 --> 34:04.690
Who is he?

34:04.690 --> 34:06.020
What a pain.

34:06.020 --> 34:07.260
This is a family matter. Get out of here.

34:07.260 --> 34:08.429
Press your finger.

34:08.429 --> 34:08.830
No.

34:08.830 --> 34:11.389
Press it.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.199
Give me your hand.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.370
You dog!

34:22.370 --> 34:24.469
Can't you hear your father's soul crying?

34:24.469 --> 34:26.139
Does someone like you count as a son?

34:26.139 --> 34:28.810
If it weren't for the President's instructions, you'd be dead by now.

34:28.810 --> 34:29.850
I can't believe you made threats.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.650
Who do you think you are? How dare you threaten Se Jin?

34:31.650 --> 34:33.679
How could you do that? You jerk!

34:33.679 --> 34:36.590
Hey, are you crazy?

34:36.590 --> 34:37.949
Oh.

34:37.949 --> 34:40.889
Do you have two boyfriends?

34:40.889 --> 34:43.530
Are you Jang Se Jin's lover?

34:43.530 --> 34:45.860
Whatever.

34:47.560 --> 34:49.330
Dr. Go.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.239
How dare you hit me?

34:53.239 --> 34:55.909
I'm gonna sue you.

34:57.870 --> 35:00.080
What's going on?

35:07.820 --> 35:09.590
Why did you take me out of there?

35:09.590 --> 35:10.590
I was the one who got beaten up.

35:10.590 --> 35:12.260
Are you already on their side?

35:12.260 --> 35:14.190
Do you take the girl's side?

35:14.190 --> 35:16.230
What do you take me for?

35:16.230 --> 35:18.600
You're in the hospital. You just made a fool of yourself.

35:18.600 --> 35:19.630
Why are you here?

35:19.630 --> 35:20.400
Because

35:20.400 --> 35:22.400
I'm the only son in the family.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.170
I can't just give up my property.

35:24.170 --> 35:25.640
Do you think that girl will do nothing?

35:25.640 --> 35:26.840
She will definitely pocket the money.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.340
How could I let that happen?

35:28.340 --> 35:29.740
So little money.

35:29.740 --> 35:30.840
So little money?

35:30.840 --> 35:32.910
You're always calculating. What's wrong with you?

35:32.910 --> 35:34.240
Am I just doing this for my own good?

35:34.240 --> 35:37.510
What you've been calculating is long gone.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.820
And that's why Cha Yeong Min is...

35:40.820 --> 35:42.220
Cha Yeong Min is what?

35:42.220 --> 35:43.750
What does that mean?

35:43.750 --> 35:46.220
You'll only think I'm crazy if I tell you.

35:46.220 --> 35:49.190
Please don't come here again.

35:58.900 --> 36:02.110
Mr. Han Seung Won. You can't do this to me.

36:03.270 --> 36:04.810
You seem to forget that

36:04.810 --> 36:08.040
I never laid a finger on the old man.

36:08.040 --> 36:12.550
I did keep my mouth shut

36:12.550 --> 36:14.680
and gently soothed everyone.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.020
First, you helped them.

36:16.020 --> 36:17.720
Then, you hit them.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.620
Those were all your work.

36:19.620 --> 36:23.030
And was it I who caused the accident of Professor Cha?

36:25.330 --> 36:30.630
If you remember, then you have to work with me.

36:30.630 --> 36:33.240
Since we started it together, we should end it together.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.670
That's good for all of us.

36:35.670 --> 36:38.940
Our game isn't over yet.

36:46.050 --> 36:48.990
We don't have any cameras or bugs in here, do we?

36:48.990 --> 36:49.620
What?

36:49.620 --> 36:52.120
You always get here at the right time.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.220
How did you know that?

36:53.220 --> 36:55.630
Well…

37:00.160 --> 37:03.630
Why risk your precious hand in such a trivial matter?

37:08.840 --> 37:11.940
Don't you know that hands are a surgeon's life?

37:16.850 --> 37:17.850
No, it's true.

37:17.850 --> 37:21.950
Two drunks punched each other on my way here.

37:21.950 --> 37:25.820
If you're drunk, go home and go to bed early.

37:25.820 --> 37:28.390
They kept fighting.

37:32.100 --> 37:34.900
It's true. My hand is fine.

37:34.900 --> 37:37.300
The vessels are fine and nerves are intact.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.600
Muscles are also fine.

37:42.940 --> 37:46.440
Why risk your precious hand in such a trivial matter?

37:46.440 --> 37:49.280
Don't you know that hands are a surgeon's life?

37:51.150 --> 37:53.020
My life is

37:53.020 --> 37:54.520
you, Se Jin.

37:54.520 --> 37:58.050
You are far more important than these hands.

37:59.020 --> 38:00.920
Do you know what you're talking about?

38:00.920 --> 38:03.130
I say the doctor's hands are life,

38:03.130 --> 38:05.330
because these hands are related to patients' lives.

38:05.330 --> 38:07.560
If you're working with this mindset, you might as well quit right now.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.330
Just quit.

38:09.330 --> 38:10.530
I know, I know.

38:10.530 --> 38:12.770
Oh, it hurts. Blow it for me.

38:12.770 --> 38:14.540
Come on.

38:14.540 --> 38:17.270
A doctor's hand should not look like this. It breaks my heart.

38:17.270 --> 38:20.010
Why are you crying for this?

38:20.010 --> 38:23.550
Don't cry. It's okay.

38:23.550 --> 38:25.450
You had a deal with me.

38:25.450 --> 38:27.180
You're a thoracic surgeon and I'm a neurosurgeon.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.050
We should take care of our hands. And what did you do?

38:29.050 --> 38:31.050
What rough hands you have.

38:31.050 --> 38:33.090
Where's the hand cream I gave you?

38:33.090 --> 38:35.390
Why don't you wear hand cream? Why?

38:38.190 --> 38:40.760
Why are you crying?

38:40.760 --> 38:44.330
Don't cry. I'm fine. Come on.

38:50.640 --> 38:54.410
So... You knew everything then and there.

38:54.410 --> 38:56.510
Why would you do that?

38:56.510 --> 38:58.510
Why?

39:14.960 --> 39:17.530
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

39:17.530 --> 39:18.840
Misunderstanding?

39:18.840 --> 39:22.870
So that wasn't you but Professor Cha?

39:22.870 --> 39:24.940
Professor Cha was there too.

39:24.940 --> 39:27.440
What about the guy who just ran out of the Emergency Room?

39:27.440 --> 39:29.210
It was also... me.

39:29.210 --> 39:31.780
Oh, was it?

39:31.780 --> 39:35.220
Dr. Jang said a word, and you ran out like the wind.

39:32.380 --> 39:35.250
[EunSang University Medical Center]

39:35.220 --> 39:38.590
You reached out your hand and looked at her lovingly.

39:38.590 --> 39:40.120
What were you going to give her?

39:40.120 --> 39:44.630
I wasn't giving her anything.

39:44.630 --> 39:46.960
Wait.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.830
Don't tell me you're…

39:48.830 --> 39:51.770
-No, why would I be jealous?
-… jeal…

39:51.770 --> 39:54.370
I can't believe you're jealous.

39:54.370 --> 39:58.940
If you weren't jealous, why would you observe what I did?

39:58.940 --> 40:01.540
You need to get your mind right.

40:01.540 --> 40:03.210
A doctor should care about the patients.

40:03.210 --> 40:05.310
Why do you care about the guardian?

40:05.310 --> 40:07.020
Well, of course that's wrong.

40:07.020 --> 40:09.020
I will be good.

40:10.650 --> 40:14.220
What is the relation between Professor Cha and Professor Jang?

40:14.220 --> 40:15.930
Are they related to each other?

40:15.930 --> 40:18.090
Well…

40:18.090 --> 40:21.230
This is private for both of them.

40:21.230 --> 40:23.230
What about Professor Cha and you?

40:23.230 --> 40:25.470
Professor Cha and me?

40:25.470 --> 40:27.370
Professor Cha can only possess you.

40:27.370 --> 40:29.410
And you can only be possessed by him.

40:29.410 --> 40:31.440
What's the relation between you two?

40:31.440 --> 40:33.440
That can't be a coincidence.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.210
Right.

40:35.210 --> 40:37.410
Exactly.

40:38.650 --> 40:40.820
It brings me to a quick question.

40:40.820 --> 40:45.120
People might say I'm crazy. But why would you believe that?

40:45.120 --> 40:47.120
I…

40:48.890 --> 40:51.660
I saw something 20 years ago.

40:55.030 --> 40:59.400
You should have told me. Why did you undertake it alone

41:00.600 --> 41:03.040
and leave by yourself?

41:03.040 --> 41:05.240
Why would you go all the way out there by yourself?

41:07.940 --> 41:10.450
I should have beaten

41:10.450 --> 41:13.920
Jang Min Ho to death.

41:16.690 --> 41:21.820
I'm sorry I acted the way I did.

41:23.030 --> 41:26.400
I shouldn't have left like that.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.530
I miss you every day.

41:29.530 --> 41:32.600
I know you hate me.

41:32.600 --> 41:35.740
I know you don't want to forgive me.

41:36.870 --> 41:39.940
I hope you get over me soon.

41:43.010 --> 41:46.050
No.

41:46.050 --> 41:48.780
I hope you don't forget me completely.

41:53.360 --> 41:56.660
When we met again,

41:56.660 --> 42:00.630
the way you looked at me looked painful.

42:05.130 --> 42:07.300
But on the other hand, I feel happy.

42:07.300 --> 42:09.540
You hate me,

42:11.540 --> 42:14.810
but you're not over me.

42:14.810 --> 42:16.810
Se Jin. That's not true.

42:16.810 --> 42:22.620
It must be tough for you. You hate me so much,

42:22.690 --> 42:23.890
and you can't forget me.

42:32.630 --> 42:34.630
I can't believe I said the word "jealous".

42:34.630 --> 42:37.170
What... I must be crazy.

42:40.640 --> 42:42.070
I heard the baby woke up.

42:42.940 --> 42:44.410
You scared me.

42:45.740 --> 42:50.280
That's great.

42:50.280 --> 42:53.320
Is it because the doctor and I worked together

42:53.320 --> 42:55.750

It means that the power of the soul outside is weakened.

What happens when the power of the soul weakens?

44:06.860 --> 44:09.890
Listen to me.

44:09.890 --> 44:11.460
Possession means that

44:11.460 --> 44:14.060
my soul goes into someone else's body

44:14.060 --> 44:16.330
by driving out the original soul.

44:17.730 --> 44:22.100
What happens when the power of the possessing soul is weakened?

44:26.240 --> 44:28.140
Look at the two of you.

44:29.080 --> 44:31.110
When the power of the possessing soul is weakened,

44:31.110 --> 44:34.180
the soul and the body tend to separate.

45:14.290 --> 45:19.030
I already told you. I'm gonna go.

45:36.250 --> 45:39.250
It means that after the brain waves get better,

45:39.250 --> 45:43.820
the soul gets weaker and then there's a delay in possession.

45:43.820 --> 45:45.150

46:32.370 --> 46:34.900
It's not your body. You deliberately...

46:34.900 --> 46:37.070
Because it's not your body, so you...

46:37.070 --> 46:39.210

But mostly it was a waste of time.

52:02.160 --> 52:05.730
When I was a kid, I always came here first in the hospital.

52:05.730 --> 52:08.540
That way I would know if I could see ghosts.

52:11.970 --> 52:16.680

53:24.310 --> 53:26.920
I ran away in fear of those people.

53:38.630 --> 53:40.960
What if I can't save them?

What if they can't deliver those words because of me?

54:04.950 --> 54:06.820

54:08.720 --> 54:11.590

1:00:44.590 --> 1:00:46.660
What's the matter now?

1:00:46.660 --> 1:00:48.490
I told you to stay away as much as possible.

1:00:48.490 --> 1:00:53.960
When did the happy-hormone patient wake up?

1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:56.600
Last time you talked to someone in America on the phone.

1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:58.800
I didn't hear the reply.

1:01:01.170 --> 1:01:02.300
You saw me?

1:01:03.170 --> 1:01:06.340
Yeah, I did it. I'm amazing, right?

1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:12.280
Hoon Gil was almost scared to death.

1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:16.990
I've been watching doctors do it for years, so I gave it a try.

1:01:16.990 --> 1:01:18.550
Being here for so long,

1:01:18.550 --> 1:01:21.320
I've seen and heard a lot, haven't I?

1:01:24.660 --> 1:01:26.190
I am a doctor.

1:01:26.190 --> 1:01:30.200
I know that you learn it by watching or something.

1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:33.100
Hey! I've been here for 20 years.

1:01:33.100 --> 1:01:36.140
Even a dog that has stayed in a medical school for 20 years could do CPR

1:01:36.140 --> 1:01:38.240
and also stitch the wound.

1:01:39.570 --> 1:01:43.210
Didn't you say you do not interfere with the life and death of the living?

1:01:43.210 --> 1:01:45.880
Come on. Is that guy alive?

1:01:45.880 --> 1:01:48.620
Leave him alone. Mind your own business.

1:01:48.620 --> 1:01:52.250
Don't run around just because your brain waves turn better.

1:01:52.250 --> 1:01:53.250
What?

1:01:53.250 --> 1:01:59.990
Can you guarantee that what happened to that guy won't happen to you?

1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:02.600
Look at you!

1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:22.280
What can I do for you?

1:02:23.180 --> 1:02:25.450
I thought you'd never contact me again.

1:02:29.420 --> 1:02:33.630
Dr. An, your words are very hurtful.

1:02:33.630 --> 1:02:37.930
Do you think it's over when you get out of it alone?

1:02:37.930 --> 1:02:40.370
Professor Cha is still alive.

1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:46.470
These patients who were rare but existed occasionally…

1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:49.810
Did they wake up?

1:02:51.610 --> 1:02:52.950
Well...

1:02:52.950 --> 1:02:55.120
Aren't you a doctor?

1:02:55.120 --> 1:02:56.950
You should know it clearly.

1:02:56.950 --> 1:02:58.590
A normal patient

1:02:58.590 --> 1:03:02.460
may die in one night.

1:03:02.460 --> 1:03:03.390
What?

1:03:04.490 --> 1:03:06.030
Medical advice?

1:03:06.030 --> 1:03:08.100
It's no big deal.

1:03:08.100 --> 1:03:11.130
There was a minor incident in the hospital today.

1:03:11.130 --> 1:03:16.970
Thanks to you, I get favorable information at this time.

1:03:16.970 --> 1:03:23.650
Like a patient in a coma

1:03:23.650 --> 1:03:26.010
who is gonna wake up but has an accident

1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:29.480
and finally dies.

1:03:39.930 --> 1:03:41.760
It's Cha Yeong Min.

1:03:42.700 --> 1:03:46.270
What does that mean?

1:03:46.270 --> 1:03:48.770
As you heard,

1:03:48.770 --> 1:03:53.170
my words and actions during this time have thrown you into confusion.

1:03:58.010 --> 1:04:01.280
Actually, that's not me. That's Professor Cha.

1:04:05.850 --> 1:04:07.190
Go Seung Tak!

1:04:10.290 --> 1:04:11.390
Are you crazy?

1:04:11.390 --> 1:04:13.430
What are you doing here?

1:04:13.430 --> 1:04:15.460
I am confessing.

1:04:15.460 --> 1:04:17.030
I'll do it this time.

1:04:18.570 --> 1:04:21.900
I… No...

1:04:23.340 --> 1:04:24.870
It's who we are.

1:04:24.870 --> 1:04:26.540
Hey! Go Seung Tak!

1:05:18.190 --> 1:05:19.860
[Preview of the next episode]

1:05:19.990 --> 1:05:22.400
Isn't there anything you're anxious to tell her?

1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:23.800
I don't want to let go anymore.

1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:25.600
So I'm getting up my courage.

1:05:25.600 --> 1:05:26.600
Guess what I find.

1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:27.200
What?

1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:28.400
The blocked wall.

1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:31.240
I found a way to make Professor Cha get better.

1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:32.940
Does that mean Professor Cha will wake up?

1:05:32.940 --> 1:05:34.140
You guys are...

1:05:34.140 --> 1:05:36.210
How should we do an operation in this situation?

1:05:36.210 --> 1:05:40.110
Is there a doctor who wants to save your life more than yourself right now?

1:05:40.110 --> 1:05:41.850
If my hands shake during the operation…

1:05:41.850 --> 1:05:43.920
Pay last respects to your master.

1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:44.920
Go Seung Tak!
