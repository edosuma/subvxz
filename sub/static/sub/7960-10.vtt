00:00.617 --> 00:01.616
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:01.617 --> 00:02.838
This is Frannie.

00:02.839 --> 00:03.883
Former student of mine.

00:03.884 --> 00:05.483
- She's homeless.
- And pregnant.

00:05.484 --> 00:07.381
And she's telling us
how she robs cars.

00:12.947 --> 00:14.236
You're gonna come home with me,

00:14.237 --> 00:15.980
and you can stay there
until we figure this out.

00:15.981 --> 00:18.078
God, no, no, you-you
don't have to do that.

00:18.079 --> 00:19.131
I certainly am not gonna

00:19.132 --> 00:20.816
put you out on the street
to raise a baby.

00:20.817 --> 00:22.696
Oh, I'm-I'm not
keeping the baby.

00:22.697 --> 00:23.696
I'm giving it up.

00:23.697 --> 00:24.986
Oh.

00:24.987 --> 00:26.066
I want it to have a safe home

00:26.067 --> 00:28.566
and a chance at a good life.

00:28.567 --> 00:30.776
I'll take it.

00:30.777 --> 00:32.237
I'll take that baby.

00:36.777 --> 00:38.316
Oof, good dinner, Ma.

00:38.317 --> 00:40.566
Sorry about the slim pickin's.

00:40.567 --> 00:41.566
Slim pickin's?

00:41.567 --> 00:42.616
It's like a Vegas buffet.

00:42.617 --> 00:44.527
The only thing missing
is Wayne Newton.

00:45.737 --> 00:47.317
I can pop in his 8-track.

00:48.987 --> 00:52.566
Uh, dinner without
the show is fine.

00:52.567 --> 00:54.616
Ma, we just didn't
come over for food.

00:54.617 --> 00:56.526
We, uh, we have some news.

00:56.527 --> 00:58.947
Oh, no, did my doctor call you?

00:59.987 --> 01:01.316
What?

01:01.317 --> 01:02.906
He said my stool sample
was fine,

01:02.907 --> 01:05.986
but I know there was something
fishy about it.

01:05.987 --> 01:08.156
On top of that, the bastard
wouldn't even give me back

01:08.157 --> 01:09.446
my Tupperware container.

01:09.447 --> 01:11.156
Aw.

01:11.157 --> 01:12.906
Ma, you got to stop
taking in samples

01:12.907 --> 01:15.156
- unless the doctor asks for them.
- Okay.

01:15.157 --> 01:16.486
Can we please get off

01:16.487 --> 01:19.156
this topic forever?

01:19.157 --> 01:21.406
And get back to our news.

01:21.407 --> 01:22.776
Here.

01:22.777 --> 01:25.776
Open this. I think you're going
to be very happy.

01:25.777 --> 01:27.406
What the hell are you doing?

01:27.407 --> 01:29.406
I just want to catch
your reaction, Ma.

01:29.407 --> 01:31.737
Oh, great,
now I got to act happy?

01:33.067 --> 01:35.856
Oh, wonderful, a dog toy.

01:35.857 --> 01:37.566
Thank you, the dog will love it.

01:37.567 --> 01:40.406
No, no, no, no, no.

01:40.407 --> 01:42.316
It is not a dog toy.

01:42.317 --> 01:43.817
Well, I'm not gonna chew on it.

01:46.197 --> 01:48.656
But who <i>is</i> gonna chew on it?

01:48.657 --> 01:52.487
Oh, my God,
did you get me another dog?

01:54.907 --> 01:56.856
All right, let's go about this
another way.

01:56.857 --> 02:00.736
Molly and I are gonna be
shopping for diapers soon.

02:00.737 --> 02:02.566
So my doctor did call.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.736
I give up.

02:04.737 --> 02:06.236
Okay, the diapers
are not for you,

02:06.237 --> 02:07.736
they're for a baby, okay?

02:07.737 --> 02:09.856
And that's a rattle for a baby

02:09.857 --> 02:11.946
because we're adopting
a baby, a human baby.

02:11.947 --> 02:13.197
You're gonna be a grandma.

02:17.157 --> 02:18.656
She's starting to track it.

02:19.657 --> 02:21.117
Or she's having a stroke.

02:22.157 --> 02:25.276
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna be a grandma?

02:25.277 --> 02:28.656
I'm gonna be a grandma!

Oh, my God.

03:03.771 --> 03:05.350
Mike, are you seeing this?

03:05.351 --> 03:07.020
I didn't see it.
I didn't see anything.

03:07.021 --> 03:10.520
Well, uh, sweetie,
Frannie's fully-clothed.

03:10.521 --> 03:11.270
Come on,
it's just my belly.

03:11.271 --> 03:12.850
I see yours every time
you reach up into the cupboard.

03:13.851 --> 03:15.770
Very funny.

03:15.771 --> 03:17.140
Wow!

03:17.141 --> 03:19.140
That is cool!

03:19.141 --> 03:20.810
So, there's the baby's head.

03:20.811 --> 03:23.140
Ooh, you've got
a cute little pea head!

03:24.521 --> 03:26.970
And those are its knees
curled to its chest.

03:26.971 --> 03:29.060
It looks like he's gonna cannonball out of the there.

03:30.141 --> 03:31.430
Everybody out of
the splash zone.

03:31.431 --> 03:32.600
It's gonna be a mess!

03:32.601 --> 03:33.600
Ew.

03:33.601 --> 03:35.310
Ew.

03:35.311 --> 03:38.230
Okay, I, I do see, how you t...

03:38.231 --> 03:40.310
I'm sorry.
That was disgusting.

03:40.311 --> 03:42.390
So, uh, do you
want to know the sex?

03:42.391 --> 03:43.560
- Absolutely.
- No.

03:43.561 --> 03:44.640
Oh, come on.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.270
No, Mike, I want
to be surprised.

03:46.271 --> 03:47.810
Okay, well, then-then
she can just tell me.

03:47.811 --> 03:51.310
No, because if I know you know,
it's gonna make me crazy

03:51.311 --> 03:53.560
and then I'll drive you crazy
because I know you know.

03:53.561 --> 03:55.850
- I know.
- So no.

03:55.851 --> 03:57.680
Okay.

03:57.681 --> 03:59.470
Well, I will say...

03:59.471 --> 04:03.350
that he or she is
a very healthy-looking baby,

04:03.351 --> 04:05.770
and appears to be
right on schedule.

04:05.771 --> 04:07.680
Great. So, we're still on
for the 15th?

04:07.681 --> 04:08.970
Oh, give or take a few days.

04:08.971 --> 04:11.310
Good. 'Cause my job in Portland
starts on the 19th.

04:11.311 --> 04:12.680
My friend's band is playing

04:12.681 --> 04:15.430
and I'm handing out flyers
and dancing on a speaker.

04:15.431 --> 04:18.519
Wait, is
that the great job opportunity

04:18.521 --> 04:20.310
you were talking about
after the baby?

04:20.310 --> 04:22.641
Twerking on a amp
for a grunge band?

04:24.249 --> 04:25.958
Uh, no, they're
actually death metal.

04:25.959 --> 04:27.038
Oh.

04:27.039 --> 04:28.038
And they're starting

04:28.039 --> 04:29.208
their Pacific Northwest tour,

04:29.209 --> 04:30.668
so I'm getting in there
on the ground floor.

04:30.669 --> 04:32.208
That's probably also where
you'll be sleeping.

04:32.209 --> 04:33.208
No.

04:33.209 --> 04:34.838
No, they said I could
sleep in the van.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.838
Oh, well... great.

04:36.839 --> 04:39.878
Young girl sleeping in a van
behind a seedy bar.

04:39.879 --> 04:42.749
Cool.

04:44.379 --> 04:45.538
<i>Okay.</i>

04:45.539 --> 04:48.378
We got beets for vitamin C,
leeks for vitamin K,

04:48.379 --> 04:50.128
radishes for calcium,

04:50.129 --> 04:53.878
and a banana so you can bring
yourself to choke it all down.

04:53.879 --> 04:57.838
Wow, uh, it's like licking
the bottom of a lawn mower.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.999
Oh, come on, it is not that bad.

05:02.209 --> 05:04.878
Mmm.

05:04.879 --> 05:06.378
Vitaminy.

05:06.379 --> 05:08.298
Hey, is that a smoothie?

05:08.299 --> 05:10.038
Yeah, packed with everything
good for you.

05:10.039 --> 05:12.208
Ooh, thanks for the heads up.

05:12.209 --> 05:14.458
Ms. Flynn is making sure
the baby eats healthy.

05:14.459 --> 05:18.128
Unfortunately,
I am the delivery system.

05:18.129 --> 05:19.709
Ha-ha!

05:20.999 --> 05:22.248
Hey, where's my half
a cheesesteak?

05:22.249 --> 05:23.378
I went through the fridge

05:23.379 --> 05:25.538
and got rid of all
the unhealthy stuff.

05:25.539 --> 05:27.208
And by "got rid of" you mean...

05:27.209 --> 05:28.708
It's gone, Mike.

05:28.709 --> 05:30.039
Ha-ha!

05:31.379 --> 05:34.498
I think I'm going
to go take a nap.

05:34.499 --> 05:35.748
Okay, well, if you want
a snack, let me know.

05:35.749 --> 05:38.498
I made you chocolate pudding
with avocados and cacao.

05:38.499 --> 05:40.459
I'll set it out
so it actually turns brown.

05:41.539 --> 05:43.339
Ha-ha!

05:43.999 --> 05:45.338
You know what? I'm good.

05:45.339 --> 05:46.588
I actually
got at Mike's cheesesteak

05:46.589 --> 05:48.168
before the trash went out.

05:48.169 --> 05:49.588
Just say it.

05:49.589 --> 05:51.379
Ha-ha!

05:54.459 --> 05:56.958
What... I'm... kind of
worried about her.

05:56.959 --> 05:58.708
Why? The cheesesteak
was wrapped in foil.

05:58.709 --> 06:01.748
Plus, it's always
better the second day.

06:01.749 --> 06:02.958
No, I'm talking about

06:02.959 --> 06:05.838
what Frannie's gonna do
after the baby.

06:05.839 --> 06:07.038
What do you mean?

06:07.039 --> 06:08.878
She's got
that big Portland plan.

06:08.879 --> 06:10.168
Sleeping in the creepy van?

06:10.169 --> 06:11.458
I mean,
what are we supposed to do,

06:11.459 --> 06:12.538
wait around for till someone
knocks her on the head

06:12.539 --> 06:14.088
and makes a suit
out of her skin?

06:14.089 --> 06:16.298
I mean, 'cause that's
where my mind goes.

06:16.299 --> 06:18.588
Boy, you go to some dark places.

06:18.589 --> 06:20.458
You wouldn't last a day in here.

06:20.459 --> 06:21.878
Listen,

06:21.879 --> 06:24.378
Frannie's already said
she doesn't want to live with us,

06:24.379 --> 06:28.168
so the best thing we can do is
support her crazy choices.

06:28.169 --> 06:29.918
Yeah, but what if she ends up
pregnant again?

06:29.919 --> 06:32.378
Then we fly her back home and get
our hands on another baby.

06:32.379 --> 06:33.798
No.

06:33.799 --> 06:35.668
We're gonna do the right thing
and help Frannie figure out

06:35.669 --> 06:38.378
a better plan
for after the baby.

06:38.379 --> 06:41.038
After that,
if she ends up knocked up,

06:41.039 --> 06:43.498
then we're clean and we're on
to baby number two.

06:44.499 --> 06:45.498
We're good people.

06:45.499 --> 06:47.597
- We really are.
- Ah.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:11.039 --> 07:13.379
Where'd you get that?
I thought we were out of donuts.

07:14.379 --> 07:15.418
Oh, I got it earlier.

07:15.419 --> 07:16.538
I'm saving it for later.

07:16.539 --> 07:18.879
You can't save it for later.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.038
Who says?

07:22.039 --> 07:23.538
Donut protocol.

07:23.539 --> 07:25.128
You either eat it at the time,

07:25.129 --> 07:26.918
or you leave it
for someone else to take.

07:26.919 --> 07:28.298
But I wasn't hungry
when I took it.

07:28.299 --> 07:29.628
Then you shouldn't
have taken it.

07:29.629 --> 07:30.668
But I know I'm gonna
want it later.

07:30.669 --> 07:31.998
Then you roll the dice

07:31.999 --> 07:34.038
and hope that it's there later.

07:34.039 --> 07:36.128
But it wouldn't be there later.

07:36.129 --> 07:39.128
Exactly. Because
someone wants it.

07:39.129 --> 07:40.669
Donut protocol.

07:44.419 --> 07:45.798
Do you want it?

07:45.799 --> 07:46.959
Of course I want it!

07:47.999 --> 07:49.668
But I'm eating healthy.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.248
Why do you think
I'm so mad about it?

07:51.249 --> 07:52.958
Mike?

07:52.959 --> 07:54.038
Oh, hey, Mol, how you doing?

07:54.039 --> 07:55.088
Yeah.

07:55.089 --> 07:56.918
I think I've got the answer
to our problems.

07:56.919 --> 07:58.538
Frannie's got an older sister.

07:58.539 --> 08:00.038
What? That's great.

08:00.039 --> 08:01.538
How come she never mentioned it?

08:01.539 --> 08:03.378
Well, I sense from
the letter that, you know,

08:03.379 --> 08:05.378
they're not exactly
on speaking terms.

08:05.379 --> 08:07.038
Wait, the sister
sent you a letter?

08:07.039 --> 08:08.498
No, Frannie about a year ago.

08:08.499 --> 08:10.208
And Frannie let you
read the letter?

08:10.209 --> 08:12.709
Well, she didn't let me
not read it.

08:14.039 --> 08:15.998
Wait, something's not
adding up here.

08:15.999 --> 08:17.878
Yeah, who just leaves
a letter lying around?

08:17.879 --> 08:19.918
I don't know, I... it could've
been laying on the desk.

08:19.919 --> 08:22.038
It could've been in
a duffel bag under her bed.

08:22.039 --> 08:24.878
Is this really what you
want to get into right now?

08:24.879 --> 08:26.628
Okay, all right.

08:26.629 --> 08:28.418
Okay, her name
is Maura DuVall, okay?

08:28.419 --> 08:30.378
And she lives in Indiana.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.168
Well, what do you want us to do?

08:32.169 --> 08:35.298
I want you to stop hassling me
and do your police thing.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.628
I mean, run her name and check
her e-mails, tap her phone.

08:37.629 --> 08:39.879
It's 2016, invade her privacy.

08:41.499 --> 08:42.878
Oh. I got it.

08:42.879 --> 08:45.498
Maura DuVall in Gary, Indiana.

08:45.499 --> 08:46.708
Oh, damn it, we're too late.

08:46.709 --> 08:48.208
She died last year.

08:48.209 --> 08:49.418
Oh, no.

08:49.419 --> 08:51.128
92 years old.

08:51.129 --> 08:53.129
God bless her heart.

08:55.539 --> 08:58.588
So are you saying
that her parents had children

08:58.589 --> 09:00.709
80 years apart?

09:02.169 --> 09:05.208
Could've been a second wife.

09:05.209 --> 09:07.668
Or it's the Maura DuVall
who is 28,

09:07.669 --> 09:08.748
lives in Bloomington,

09:08.749 --> 09:10.538
and is originally from Chicago.

09:10.539 --> 09:11.628
Bingo.

09:11.629 --> 09:12.708
Yeah, these computers
are amazing.

09:12.709 --> 09:13.838
You know, it's how I found out

09:13.839 --> 09:15.538
that there's three
Carl McMillans in town.

09:15.539 --> 09:17.168
Yeah, you know, I keep trying
to get us all together,

09:17.169 --> 09:18.958
but they just
don't seem interested.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.878
It's ringing.

09:21.879 --> 09:23.668
Yes, is this Maura DuVall?

09:23.669 --> 09:25.248
Uh, this is Officer
Michael Biggs

09:25.249 --> 09:26.918
from the Chicago
Police Department.

09:26.919 --> 09:30.378
I am calling in regards to
your little sister, Frannie.

09:30.379 --> 09:32.458
Oh, no, no, calm down,
ma'am, she's fine.

09:32.459 --> 09:34.168
She's pregnant
and I have her in my basement.

09:34.169 --> 09:36.538
No, no, no!

09:36.539 --> 09:38.539
Ma'am, calm down!

09:43.669 --> 09:45.378
All righty.

09:45.379 --> 09:48.539
Have a seat right here,
little lady.

09:53.089 --> 09:55.588
Why are you both smiling at me?

09:55.589 --> 09:57.038
It's creepy.

09:57.039 --> 09:58.628
Oh!

09:58.629 --> 10:00.798
We have some exciting
news.

10:00.799 --> 10:02.458
Wait, wait, wait, don't-don't
tell, don't tell her yet.

10:02.459 --> 10:03.739
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:05.919 --> 10:07.708
Okay, we're rolling.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.088
Okay.

10:09.089 --> 10:10.418
Don't ask us how we know,

10:10.419 --> 10:13.338
but we found out that you
have a sister in Indiana.

10:17.209 --> 10:19.538
Uh, that's your exciting news?

10:19.539 --> 10:23.668
Uh, well, no, the exciting news
is that we talked to her

10:23.669 --> 10:25.628
and she would very much
like to see you.

10:28.749 --> 10:30.378
Really?

10:30.379 --> 10:31.748
Okay, well then
she shouldn't have left me

10:31.749 --> 10:33.958
high and dry with my parents,
ten years ago.

10:33.959 --> 10:35.378
Okay, all right.

10:35.379 --> 10:38.208
She did mention that you might
be a little angry with her,

10:38.209 --> 10:40.168
but that was a long time ago.

10:40.169 --> 10:41.878
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I was ten years old

10:41.879 --> 10:44.708
and she left me alone with those
Bible-thumping lunatics.

10:44.709 --> 10:46.958
And I'm sure
that she would love to tell you

10:46.959 --> 10:50.378
that she is sorry, if you were
ever willing to talk to her,

10:50.379 --> 10:53.749
say in a safe and, perhaps,
neutral environment.

11:01.039 --> 11:02.879
Please don't tell me she's here.

11:05.129 --> 11:06.379
Right here, no.

11:07.999 --> 11:09.878
She's on the porch.

11:09.879 --> 11:12.668
She's on the porch!

11:12.669 --> 11:16.628
I cannot believe you guys would
do this without talking to me!

11:16.629 --> 11:18.168
- Frannie...
- Wait, wait, if you're gonna follow her,

11:18.169 --> 11:19.919
take the phone.

11:21.539 --> 11:25.379
we suck at surprises.

11:39.924 --> 11:41.923
So Bloomington, huh?

11:41.924 --> 11:43.003
Yeah, yeah.

11:43.004 --> 11:44.003
I hear it's nice.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.213
It's not.

11:45.214 --> 11:46.794
That's what I hear, too.

11:48.084 --> 11:49.083
Listen, kid,

11:49.084 --> 11:51.133
I know what you're
going through.

11:51.134 --> 11:53.423
I got a half brother
that hates my guts, too.

11:53.424 --> 11:54.873
I convinced him to invest

11:54.874 --> 11:57.083
every penny he had
in a pyramid scheme.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.253
Lost his house, everything.

11:59.254 --> 12:02.754
Ended up living in the box
the skin care products came in.

12:04.584 --> 12:06.173
I'm glad we got out when we did.

12:06.174 --> 12:08.348
Yeah, we did okay.

12:10.084 --> 12:12.253
Believe me, I didn't
want to leave Frannie.

12:12.254 --> 12:14.753
I was young and I had
to get out of that house.

12:14.754 --> 12:16.583
I mean, I could barely
take care of myself,

12:16.584 --> 12:18.423
let alone a seven-year-old.

12:18.424 --> 12:20.463
Listen, nobody here's
judging you for running out.

12:20.464 --> 12:21.673
Oh, God.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.543
Can't tell you
how many times I drove around

12:23.544 --> 12:25.753
with a packed
suitcase in my car.

12:25.754 --> 12:28.503
What? I thought you
were always talking about

12:28.504 --> 12:29.964
taking that stuff to Goodwill?

12:31.584 --> 12:34.833
Well, I couldn't tell you
I was thinking of leaving.

12:34.834 --> 12:37.754
Geez, what-what kind of
mother would that be?

12:39.464 --> 12:41.753
All right, maybe in hindsight,

12:41.754 --> 12:44.253
we shouldn't have
gone behind your back.

12:44.254 --> 12:45.634
Or through your duffel bag.

12:47.674 --> 12:50.083
We were, we were
concerned about you,

12:50.084 --> 12:53.083
and-and we thought that if you
could reconnect with your sister

12:53.084 --> 12:55.333
she could help you out
after you had the baby.

12:55.334 --> 12:57.423
I don't need her help.

12:57.424 --> 12:58.463
I have a plan.

12:58.464 --> 13:00.083
The go-go gig in Portland?

13:00.084 --> 13:03.834
Honey... that plan blows.

13:05.424 --> 13:06.833
What, you got a better one?

13:06.834 --> 13:08.423
Yes, upstairs
sitting on our couch.

13:08.424 --> 13:10.043
It's too late for that.

13:10.044 --> 13:11.213
Is it?

13:11.214 --> 13:12.583
You know, Frannie,
when I told your sister

13:12.584 --> 13:13.873
what you were going through,

13:13.874 --> 13:15.963
she dropped everything
and drove straight up here.

13:15.964 --> 13:17.173
You know,
I can't even get my sister

13:17.174 --> 13:18.754
to drive me to the airport.

13:20.714 --> 13:22.043
Just talk to her.

13:22.044 --> 13:23.333
Give her a chance.

13:23.334 --> 13:25.423
But... you know what?

13:25.424 --> 13:28.833
It's your decision
and if you want me

13:28.834 --> 13:30.543
to go upstairs
and tell her to leave, I will.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.003
- Tell her to leave.
- No!

13:32.004 --> 13:33.923
I'm not gonna do that.

13:33.924 --> 13:36.373
Now get up there
and talk to her.

13:36.374 --> 13:38.373
Fine!

13:38.374 --> 13:40.503
Don't give us that look,
young lady.

13:40.504 --> 13:42.334
Get up there!

13:43.424 --> 13:44.543
I think we're
gonna be good parents.

13:44.544 --> 13:45.673
Me, too.

13:45.674 --> 13:46.713
Yeah.

13:49.924 --> 13:51.543
Okay, here we go.

13:51.544 --> 13:54.873
A little decaf lemon zinger
to ease things along.

13:54.874 --> 13:56.293
Now, I threw out
all the cookies,

13:56.294 --> 14:00.003
so I just poured a little
All-Bran in a bowl there.

14:00.004 --> 14:01.083
Enjoy.

14:01.084 --> 14:02.373
Thank you.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.543
You're very welcome.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.173
Remember, this isn't going
to be easy.

14:07.174 --> 14:09.083
You know?
This is about healing.

14:09.084 --> 14:11.173
Quiet is okay.

14:11.174 --> 14:12.373
Silence is fine.

14:12.374 --> 14:13.543
You can't fill every minute

14:13.544 --> 14:14.923
of every single second
with chitter chatter

14:14.924 --> 14:16.923
- and stories and...
- Molly!

14:16.924 --> 14:18.373
Yup!
Okay, all right.

14:18.374 --> 14:19.873
Well, I'll leave you to it.

14:19.874 --> 14:21.254
What was that?
Did you...?

14:22.714 --> 14:23.753
We didn't say anything.

14:23.754 --> 14:24.923
Oh, great.

14:24.924 --> 14:27.333
I'll just be in the kitchen
if you need me.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.713
Healing.

14:28.714 --> 14:30.253
Okay? Healing.

14:30.254 --> 14:31.753
Mending broken fences.

14:31.754 --> 14:33.633
The olive branch
goes back to the Roman...

14:33.634 --> 14:35.373
- Molly!
- Yup, yeah, yeah.

14:37.874 --> 14:39.423
What's going on?

14:39.424 --> 14:41.083
I don't know. It's really
awkward out there.

14:41.084 --> 14:43.253
Well, I'm sure
the All-Bran will fix that.

14:43.254 --> 14:46.043
I'm just glad they're
out there talking together.

14:46.044 --> 14:48.253
I mean, hopefully they'll
find something to bond over.

14:48.254 --> 14:49.833
I mean, they both
hate their parents.

14:49.834 --> 14:52.174
Seems like a pretty solid
foundation to start.

14:53.584 --> 14:55.583
I don't know if this is
the right time to say this,

14:55.584 --> 14:57.253
but can we switch rooms?

14:57.254 --> 14:59.003
There are two people
and we got five of us

14:59.004 --> 15:01.084
jammed in here like animals.

15:02.754 --> 15:05.254
I'm fine, I'm just
worried about you guys.

15:10.924 --> 15:12.963
So...

15:12.964 --> 15:14.963
How far along are you?

15:14.964 --> 15:16.793
Please don't make small talk.

15:16.794 --> 15:18.753
What do you want me to say?

15:18.754 --> 15:20.503
You don't want
to hear my apologies,

15:20.504 --> 15:22.173
you don't want to hear
why I left...

15:22.174 --> 15:24.634
It's not gonna undo
what you did.

15:25.964 --> 15:27.794
Frannie, I know that.

15:30.334 --> 15:32.373
I've just missed you so much.

15:32.374 --> 15:35.963
You don't think I've missed you?

15:35.964 --> 15:38.543
You were more of a mother to me
than mom ever was.

15:38.544 --> 15:40.543
She says, "You were more
of a brother to me

15:40.544 --> 15:41.834
than Tom ever was."

15:43.874 --> 15:45.213
Who's Tom?

15:45.214 --> 15:46.833
Maybe he's the father
of the baby?

15:46.834 --> 15:48.084
The plot thickens.

15:49.084 --> 15:50.423
No, that can't be right.

15:50.424 --> 15:51.424
Mike, get out of there.

15:53.424 --> 15:54.634
All right, Maura's talking.

15:55.924 --> 15:58.924
She said, "You're my sister
and I've always loved you."

16:00.504 --> 16:01.753
Frannie says, "I love you, too."

16:01.754 --> 16:03.043
That is so sweet.

16:03.044 --> 16:04.333
Molly, we don't say that enough.

16:04.334 --> 16:06.423
Quiet!

16:06.424 --> 16:07.873
Okay, Maura's telling her that

16:07.874 --> 16:10.543
she can come live
with her in Indiana.

16:10.544 --> 16:12.043
Oh, there's a hug.

16:13.584 --> 16:15.793
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

16:15.794 --> 16:17.083
Okay, they're talking again.

16:17.084 --> 16:19.423
Maura says, "I have a great job,

16:19.424 --> 16:22.083
"wonderful husband.

16:22.084 --> 16:25.423
We both want to help you
raise the baby."

16:25.424 --> 16:26.874
Wait, what?

16:28.504 --> 16:30.334
And they're hugging again.

16:32.334 --> 16:34.293
She can't do that.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.674
Can she?

16:36.674 --> 16:38.754
I think she just did.

16:43.504 --> 16:45.673
I feel sick.

16:45.674 --> 16:47.423
I don't even know what
I'm looking for in these drawers.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.543
I'm just afraid if
I stop doing it,

16:49.544 --> 16:50.713
I'm gonna fall apart.

16:50.714 --> 16:52.753
Why'd we have
to call her sister?

16:52.754 --> 16:54.713
'Cause it was
the right thing to do.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.043
Yeah, for everybody but us.

16:57.254 --> 16:58.634
Ms. Flynn?

17:00.964 --> 17:02.964
Come in.

17:05.753 --> 17:07.923
Hey. I just wanted
to thank you both

17:07.924 --> 17:09.833
for getting me
in touch with Maura.

17:09.834 --> 17:10.833
Are you sure?

17:10.834 --> 17:12.173
What do we really
know about her?

17:12.174 --> 17:14.133
Mike.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.964
Um, you know, she actually said
that I could stay with her.

17:19.003 --> 17:20.292
Yeah, we heard.

17:20.294 --> 17:22.042
We also heard her say

17:22.044 --> 17:25.133
that she wants to take you
and the baby.

17:25.134 --> 17:29.083
Well... then you heard me
tell her no.

17:29.084 --> 17:31.003
What?

17:31.004 --> 17:33.583
I made a promise to you two.

17:33.584 --> 17:35.633
I'm not going back on that.

17:35.634 --> 17:38.043
You're not?

17:38.044 --> 17:39.583
No.

17:39.584 --> 17:43.003
You guys are gonna
be great parents.

17:43.004 --> 17:45.753
Oh my God, Frannie, thank you.

17:45.754 --> 17:48.583
Uh, hey, I actually,
I have something for you.

17:48.584 --> 17:50.424
My sister got it for the baby.

17:51.544 --> 17:52.793
Maybe when he

17:52.794 --> 17:54.873
or she gets older,

17:54.874 --> 17:57.253
you can tell him
I didn't want to give him up,

17:57.254 --> 17:59.794
I just wanted him to have
the best life possible.

18:01.924 --> 18:03.253
You can't do this.

18:03.254 --> 18:04.793
What?

18:04.794 --> 18:07.424
Things are different
now, I mean...

18:09.174 --> 18:12.253
You have the chance
to bring up your baby

18:12.254 --> 18:15.253
and you didn't have
that chance before.

18:15.254 --> 18:16.253
Mol, what are you doing?

18:16.254 --> 18:19.583
No, because it's hard enough.

18:19.584 --> 18:21.464
But I promised you.

18:23.714 --> 18:26.963
If you want this baby,
half as much as I do,

18:26.964 --> 18:30.633
you are never
gonna forgive yourself

18:30.634 --> 18:33.374
if you keep this promise.

18:37.424 --> 18:39.253
I don't know what to do.

18:39.254 --> 18:40.754
Yeah, you do.

18:54.502 --> 18:56.331
Oh, it's good they left
a little early.

18:56.332 --> 18:59.121
This way they'll be
able to beat traffic.

18:59.122 --> 19:01.671
I'm pouring a drink
if anyone wants one.

19:01.672 --> 19:04.922
I'll have a cosmopolitan with
a sugared rim and a lemon twist.

19:06.882 --> 19:09.541
Or whatever. Just...

19:09.542 --> 19:12.501
I'm never getting my hopes up
for anything again.

19:12.502 --> 19:15.001
You know, I'll see you later,
I'm going to the horse track.

19:15.002 --> 19:17.461
Okay, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

19:17.462 --> 19:19.621
Okay.

19:19.622 --> 19:21.671
Okay, we have every reason

19:21.672 --> 19:24.121
to be sad but...

19:24.122 --> 19:26.331
we also have plenty
of reasons to be happy.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.461
I mean, we-we just got
a family back together.

19:29.462 --> 19:34.331
And, you know, maybe this...
baby got away from us,

19:34.332 --> 19:38.041
but I'll tell you what, the next
one's not gonna be so lucky.

19:38.042 --> 19:40.381
You're damn right,
and we're still going to adopt.

19:40.382 --> 19:43.421
There's a baby out there
with our name on it.

19:43.422 --> 19:45.421
Before you know it, we'll be up
all hours of the night...

19:46.422 --> 19:48.501
...knee-deep in dirty diapers.

19:48.502 --> 19:52.332
Got a lot of leftover pacifiers
from my rave days, so...

19:54.502 --> 19:55.961
You know what
I'm looking forward to?

19:55.962 --> 19:59.041
Holding a baby
in a rocking chair,

19:59.042 --> 20:00.881
hearing that little rumble
in the diaper

20:00.882 --> 20:03.172
and knowing I don't have
to change it.

20:05.122 --> 20:06.831
Don't forget the terrible twos.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.461
And the terrible threes.

20:08.462 --> 20:10.541
And puberty, brutal.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.171
That's when they hate you.

20:12.172 --> 20:13.501
God, I can't wait.
