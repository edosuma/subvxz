00:50.760 --> 00:54.889
And we're on
in four, three,

00:54.973 --> 00:56.891
two, one.

00:59.060 --> 01:02.814
What if I told you that even the
worst neighborhood in America

01:02.897 --> 01:04.983
could be made completely safe.

01:05.150 --> 01:08.069
And what if I told you that
this could be accomplished

01:08.153 --> 01:09.362
without risking the life

01:09.446 --> 01:12.323
of one single
law enforcement officer.

01:12.490 --> 01:13.908
How do I know this?

01:13.992 --> 01:16.202
Because it's happening right now

01:16.286 --> 01:18.580
in every country in the world

01:18.663 --> 01:20.457
but this one.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.502
<i>I'm Pat Novak, and welcome
to The Novak Element.</i>

01:29.215 --> 01:30.759
In tonight's
State of the Union segment

01:30.842 --> 01:32.886
we'll be joined
by General Curtis Monroe

01:32.969 --> 01:35.180
live from the War Room
in the Pentagon.

01:36.848 --> 01:38.683
General Monroe, welcome back.

01:38.808 --> 01:39.934
<i>Good to see you, Pat.</i>

01:40.018 --> 01:44.355
Thank you for this unprecedented
access to your operations.

01:44.522 --> 01:48.151
Could you walk us through
what we're seeing here?

01:48.318 --> 01:50.528
<i>Well, this is
a routine operation.</i>

01:50.653 --> 01:52.781
<i>We found that random patrols</i>

01:52.864 --> 01:56.242
<i>helped the local population to
feel safer and to trust us.</i>

01:56.326 --> 01:57.327
It's amazing.

01:57.452 --> 01:59.746
And what are these colored dots

01:59.829 --> 02:01.331
that we're seeing here, General?

02:01.498 --> 02:04.417
<i>These are our assets
on the ground.</i>

02:04.501 --> 02:07.086
<i>In green,
we got the ED-209s.</i>

02:07.170 --> 02:09.881
<i>They're the big boys.
They secure the perimeter.</i>

02:10.048 --> 02:12.217
<i>Purple are
the smaller EM-208s.</i>

02:12.300 --> 02:13.843
<i>They sweep and mop up.</i>

02:14.010 --> 02:16.888
<i>And the red dots, Pat,
that's your film crew.</i>

02:18.640 --> 02:21.100
It is great to see
American machines

02:21.184 --> 02:24.479
helping to promote
peace and freedom abroad.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.314
<i>All right, you guys, this is
a standard op, all right?</i>

02:26.397 --> 02:27.774
<i>There's no opposition expected.</i>

02:27.857 --> 02:30.026
<i>I'm gonna set your markers
to code red.</i>

02:33.404 --> 02:35.907
All our drones are gonna give
top priority to your safety.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.117
No red assets
have ever been lost.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.327
Okay.
Okay?

02:39.410 --> 02:40.745
Does that make you feel better?

02:41.037 --> 02:42.747
But, listen,

02:42.831 --> 02:44.582
<i>keep those bracelets on,
you're completely safe.</i>

02:44.666 --> 02:45.750
<i>Okay?</i>

02:45.834 --> 02:47.085
<i>Good. Enjoy the show.</i>

02:53.007 --> 02:55.343
All right. Let's go.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.433
<i>May peace
be upon you.</i>

03:03.059 --> 03:06.271
<i>Please exit your homes
with your arms raised</i>

03:06.354 --> 03:08.857
<i>for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.</i>

03:08.940 --> 03:10.942
<i>No one will be harmed.</i>

03:21.119 --> 03:23.538
<i>Please exit your homes
with your arms raised</i>

03:23.621 --> 03:26.291
<i>for a noninvasive
scanning procedure.</i>

03:26.791 --> 03:28.543
<i>No one will be harmed.</i>

03:31.129 --> 03:32.755
Scott, get me a shot of this.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.508
<i>Your cooperation
is appreciated.</i>

03:35.592 --> 03:38.511
<i>We apologize
for any inconvenience.</i>

03:40.722 --> 03:42.307
<i>May peace be upon you.</i>

03:50.440 --> 03:51.482
Incredible.

03:51.983 --> 03:53.902
Incredible!

03:54.068 --> 03:58.323
Not long ago, that would have
been American men and women

03:58.406 --> 04:01.576
risking their lives
to pacify these people.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.871
General, you care
to comment on this?

04:04.954 --> 04:07.415
<i>Well, Pat, we had Vietnam,</i>

04:07.498 --> 04:10.293
<i>we had Iraq, we had Afghanistan.</i>

04:10.835 --> 04:12.045
<i>Never again.</i>

04:12.128 --> 04:15.590
<i>From a military perspective,
this has been invaluable.</i>

04:15.757 --> 04:17.466
<i>We can accomplish our objectives</i>

04:17.550 --> 04:19.594
<i>without any loss
to American lives</i>

04:19.677 --> 04:23.014
<i>and I think the honest people
over there really appreciate it.</i>

04:23.389 --> 04:24.933
And why wouldn't they?

04:25.016 --> 04:27.352
For the first time
in their lives

04:27.435 --> 04:29.771
they get to watch
their children grow up

04:29.854 --> 04:33.733
in an environment
of safety and security.

04:35.276 --> 04:35.777
Navid!

04:35.778 --> 04:37.195
Get away from the window!

04:37.528 --> 04:39.364
Mom! They're here! They're coming!

04:40.615 --> 04:42.200
Come here! Come here right now!

04:42.784 --> 04:43.784
Arash!

04:44.619 --> 04:46.412
Navid! You stay with your mom and sisters!

04:46.579 --> 04:47.288
But he's just a kid.

04:47.288 --> 04:47.705
Seven!

04:48.247 --> 04:49.727
Stay here with your mom and the kids!

04:50.333 --> 04:52.093
What do you think you're doing?
You heard me!

04:52.168 --> 04:54.545
Arash, please don't go! Don't do this!

04:57.632 --> 04:58.872
Navid! My dear! Come back here!

05:00.468 --> 05:01.468
Navid!

05:01.719 --> 05:02.719
Shut the door!

05:03.972 --> 05:05.556
We're not here to kill any of them.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.474
Got it?

05:07.558 --> 05:10.269
The goal is to die on television.

05:10.812 --> 05:11.812
Let's go!

05:12.563 --> 05:13.564
<i>Kelly!</i>

05:13.690 --> 05:15.316
<i>Can you hear me out there?</i>

05:15.483 --> 05:18.319
<i>Loud and clear, Pat.
I'm here in sunny Tehran</i>

05:18.403 --> 05:22.657
where locals have clearly
embraced these routine scans.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.701
As you can see behind me,
they're working

05:24.784 --> 05:26.577
in collaboration with the robots

05:26.661 --> 05:31.165
and obviously their safety
is everyone's top priority.

05:49.058 --> 05:50.601
Don't make a move before I say...

05:51.060 --> 05:52.812
I wanna make sure they're recording.

05:53.396 --> 05:53.771
Yes!

05:54.147 --> 05:55.147
Yes! Yes!

05:55.273 --> 05:56.273
We're ready.

06:01.446 --> 06:02.530
<i>You'll notice children</i>

06:02.613 --> 06:04.657
<i>in the streets as well.
This is everyday life</i>

06:04.741 --> 06:06.826
<i>happening in perfect harmony.</i>

06:12.081 --> 06:13.374
<i>Oh, great.
Here, come here.</i>

06:13.458 --> 06:14.618
<i>Stay put, stay put, stay put.</i>

06:14.751 --> 06:16.312
It's fine. Don't worry.
My guy's got it.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.639
Navid! It's dangerous here!

06:31.642 --> 06:32.642
Come away! Come...

06:32.643 --> 06:33.895
Navid, where are you going?

06:35.438 --> 06:36.855
Look at me! Navid! Navid!

06:36.856 --> 06:38.316
What are you looking for? Navid!

06:39.317 --> 06:40.902
Navid! Navid! What are you...

06:41.360 --> 06:42.361
Navid! Don't go! Navid!

06:58.961 --> 07:00.129
Oh, my God!

07:07.095 --> 07:08.346
<i>Drop your weapon.</i>

07:13.643 --> 07:14.685
<i>Kelly?</i>

07:14.852 --> 07:16.771
Kelly!
Are you all right? Kelly!

07:16.938 --> 07:18.022
<i>We're okay, Pat.</i>

07:18.106 --> 07:20.525
<i>Our robots have just repelled
some suicide bombers.</i>

07:20.942 --> 07:22.318
I'm sorry, Kelly,

07:22.401 --> 07:26.197
but for security reasons the Pentagon's
going to cut our feed to Tehran.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.573
But, please, be careful.

07:27.657 --> 07:29.450
<i>Yeah. I'll continue
to stand by.</i>

07:31.869 --> 07:36.457
Now you see how fundamental these
robots are to our foreign policy.

07:37.125 --> 07:38.334
So then tell me.

07:38.501 --> 07:42.839
Why can't we use these
machines here at home?

07:43.172 --> 07:47.969
Why is America so robophobic?

07:48.886 --> 07:51.889
On the one hand,
we have Raymond Sellars.

07:52.807 --> 07:55.977
An entrepreneur
and true American

07:56.060 --> 07:59.230
whose product just saved
my colleague's life.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.607
And on the other.

08:01.691 --> 08:04.110
Hubert Dreyfus.

08:04.193 --> 08:08.239
A man with both feet
planted firmly in the past

08:08.489 --> 08:12.702
whose bill prohibits the
use of drones on US soil.

08:12.869 --> 08:15.913
The American people
support the Dreyfus Act

08:16.080 --> 08:19.542
because they haven't
experienced this technology

08:19.709 --> 08:22.753
and they fear
what they don't understand.

08:23.379 --> 08:26.757
<i>We at The Novak Element
support Mr. Sellars' efforts</i>

08:27.091 --> 08:30.178
to make our country
and our viewers safer.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.263
After all,

08:32.346 --> 08:36.392
what's more important than the
safety of the American people?

09:03.628 --> 09:05.254
Hey, Murphy.
Hey.

09:07.465 --> 09:08.883
How's Jack?

09:09.300 --> 09:10.760
We don't know yet.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.970
MurphY-
Hey.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.972
How's it going?
Good.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.049
What the hell
are they doing here?

09:22.104 --> 09:25.024
Six in the morgue.
Lewis in the hospital.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.026
This was the mother
of all bad ideas.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.070
We got a lead on Antoine
Vallon, we took it.

09:29.153 --> 09:30.154
What lead?

09:31.113 --> 09:32.406
Not in front of them.

09:32.907 --> 09:34.825
This is bullshit. Yeah?

09:34.992 --> 09:36.577
Yeah, you got something
to say, Murphy?

09:36.661 --> 09:37.745
Vallon's our case.

09:37.828 --> 09:41.666
Yeah, two years without no arrest, no
nothing? You've gotta be dumb or dirty.

09:42.667 --> 09:45.086
You got something on us?
Or is this personal?

09:45.294 --> 09:47.171
No, it's nothing personal.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.423
Although, I don't
like you as a person.

09:49.674 --> 09:51.509
Okay, you two, out.

09:51.676 --> 09:53.094
No problem.

09:54.229 --> 09:55.989
Maybe if you hadn't
gone off the reservation,

09:56.013 --> 09:57.556
your partner would
still be standing.

09:57.682 --> 09:59.562
- What'd you say to me?
- Hey, that's enough!

10:02.645 --> 10:03.854
Okay, Alex.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.442
It's just you and me now.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.529
So me and Jack, we've been
doin' some street buys.

10:11.696 --> 10:13.197
We get a line on some guns.

10:13.948 --> 10:16.867
<i>We meet up with this
low-level G called Jerry</i>

10:17.034 --> 10:19.495
<i>who ends up havin' a piece
he's not supposed to have.</i>

10:19.662 --> 10:21.463
Where the hell you get a
gun like that, Jerry?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.457
I can get you two
whole crates full, man.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.625
Two crates?

10:24.792 --> 10:25.793
No disrespect, J,

10:25.876 --> 10:27.836
but how a clown like you
get so much product, man?

10:27.878 --> 10:29.046
What's it matter
where it comes from?

10:29.213 --> 10:31.799
Why it matters, we don't
want no dirty guns, Jerry.

10:31.966 --> 10:33.718
These guns got bodies
on 'em, Jerry?

10:33.884 --> 10:35.052
Yo, look,
they're clean, all right?

10:35.136 --> 10:36.595
You gonna buy this shit or not?

10:36.679 --> 10:38.139
Why you acting so nervous, man?

10:38.222 --> 10:40.057
You fishin' on us, Jerry?

10:40.141 --> 10:41.225
What'd you say?

10:41.350 --> 10:43.390
You think he fishin', D?
I think he's fishin' on us.

10:43.394 --> 10:44.812
Yo, what the hell
are they talkin' about, man?

10:44.895 --> 10:46.230
Hey, let me see your phone.

10:46.731 --> 10:47.732
Let me see your phone.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.025
I'm not showing you
my phone, man!

10:49.108 --> 10:50.359
You recordin' this?

10:50.651 --> 10:52.111
I think you're a goddamn cop!

10:52.194 --> 10:53.195
What the hell are
you talkin' about, man?

10:53.279 --> 10:54.572
I'm not showing you my phone!

10:54.697 --> 10:55.740
Hey! Put your gun down!

10:55.823 --> 10:57.033
Putyourphones on the table.

10:57.116 --> 10:59.236
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.244
What?

11:00.411 --> 11:02.204
Shut up! Shut up!
What'd you say?

11:02.580 --> 11:04.373
Ends up he works for Vallon.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.335
Before the meet, we ran the
serial numbers on the rifles.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.670
The guns were supposed to be
in our evidence room.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.423
<i>Not out on the street.</i>

11:12.590 --> 11:14.675
<i>Intake papers blank.
No signatures.</i>

11:14.842 --> 11:17.094
What do you got?
Nothin'.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.764
How do you think that happened?

11:21.682 --> 11:23.684
I'm telling you, Murphy,
this is a mistake.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.771
These guys'll shoot you just
to see if they gun work.

11:27.188 --> 11:28.230
We need backup.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.717
If we call for backup, word's
gonna get around the station.

11:30.775 --> 11:32.109
He's gonna disappear.

11:32.443 --> 11:33.944
It's gonna be all right.

11:34.779 --> 11:37.031
<i>MURPHY". So we told Vallon
we were gun buyers,</i>

11:37.198 --> 11:38.366
<i>and he bought it.</i>

11:38.532 --> 11:42.453
What do you two need with that
much product? You plotting a coup?

11:43.412 --> 11:45.932
Man, don't trip, we ain't gonna
bust a single shot in your town.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.875
We got some problems
back home with Chicago PD.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.003
Yeah, I heard
you don't like cops.

11:51.587 --> 11:52.963
Hey, boss.

11:54.465 --> 11:55.966
What do you got for me?

11:57.760 --> 11:58.761
Really?

11:58.942 --> 12:01.782
<i>We were just about to close
the deal but someone tipped him off.</i>

12:01.806 --> 12:04.225
Gentlemen,
I gotta deal with this.

12:04.392 --> 12:05.810
Two minutes.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.318
Make sure you kill 'em both!

12:23.285 --> 12:26.080
I got two handguns,
one automatic.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.011
We gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna take the automatic.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.471
You sure about this?

13:04.827 --> 13:05.828
You ready?

13:06.120 --> 13:07.121
Move.

13:47.661 --> 13:48.829
Lewis!

13:49.747 --> 13:50.873
Lewis!

13:53.751 --> 13:57.421
Officer down!
Officer down, 331 Hamilton.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.048
This is Detective Alex Murphy

13:59.131 --> 14:01.050
in need of immediate
medical assistance.

14:01.217 --> 14:03.219
331 Hamilton Road.

14:04.220 --> 14:05.262
Jack.

14:06.263 --> 14:09.225
Jack, come on.
Jack. Can you hear me?

14:09.767 --> 14:11.727
Jack. Stay with me.

14:12.686 --> 14:13.771
Jack.

14:14.355 --> 14:17.608
<i>Alex, you don't
do something like this</i>

14:17.775 --> 14:19.443
unless you bring it to me first.

14:19.610 --> 14:20.945
Vallon's connected.

14:21.111 --> 14:24.907
I'm warning you, don't make any
more moves until I vet this.

14:25.074 --> 14:26.784
If officers are
supplying him with guns...

14:26.867 --> 14:28.953
That's up to IAD.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.913
I'll handle it.

14:36.585 --> 14:41.257
I don't care how sophisticated
these machines are, Mr. Sellars.

14:41.465 --> 14:45.970
A machine does not know what
it feels like to be human.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.514
It can't understand
the value of human life.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.099
Why should it be
allowed to take one?

14:51.308 --> 14:54.687
To legislate
over life and death,

14:54.770 --> 14:58.566
we need people who
understand right from wrong.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.985
What do your machines feel?

15:01.151 --> 15:04.613
Well, they feel no anger.
They feel no prejudice.

15:04.780 --> 15:09.326
They feel no fatigue, which makes
them ideal for law enforcement.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.497
Putting these machines
on the streets

15:13.664 --> 15:16.667
will save countless
American lives.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.794
You're evading the question.
No, I'm not.

15:18.836 --> 15:19.878
Yes,
you're evading the question.

15:19.962 --> 15:23.424
I asked what do
these machines feel?

15:23.591 --> 15:26.427
If one of them killed a child,

15:27.511 --> 15:28.971
what would it feel?

15:32.600 --> 15:34.476
Nothing.
And that's the problem.

15:34.643 --> 15:39.940
That's why 72% of Americans will not
stand for a robot pulling the trigger.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.909
America is the world's most
valuable market, and we can't touch it.

15:51.201 --> 15:56.498
With a domestic expansion, we'd
clear $600 billion per annum.

15:56.665 --> 16:01.545
In other words, every second that law is
in existence, we are hemorrhaging money.

16:01.712 --> 16:02.752
What do you want me to do?

16:02.880 --> 16:06.216
We've thrown cash at senators at both
sides of the aisle. Nobody's budging.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.383
They don't want to vote
against their constituents.

16:08.469 --> 16:11.513
So unless we sway public
opinion, the battle's lost.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.641
Now, to that effect,

16:13.807 --> 16:18.062
my team have come up with a
pretty aggressive new campaign.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.731
Wow factor
off-the-charts.

16:20.898 --> 16:23.734
We need to give Americans
a product they can love.

16:24.068 --> 16:25.736
A figure they can rally behind.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.906
Sir, I have dissected this bill.
There are no loopholes.

16:29.073 --> 16:30.741
We can't put a machine
on the streets.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.034
Forget machines.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.577
You saw the polls.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.246
Americans don't want a machine.

16:37.498 --> 16:39.083
They want

16:39.166 --> 16:41.919
a product with a conscience.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.505
They want

16:44.588 --> 16:47.466
something that knows

16:48.509 --> 16:51.011
what it feels like

16:51.095 --> 16:52.554
to be human.

16:59.103 --> 17:01.438
We're gonna put a man
inside a machine.

17:05.233 --> 17:09.070
You're not you because
of your legs, your arms, your hands.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.823
You're you because
of your brain.

17:10.906 --> 17:15.327
It's your brain's capacity to process
information that makes you who you are.

17:16.704 --> 17:20.958
Relax, and just do
what you've always done.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.588
I've never played with these.

17:26.797 --> 17:31.093
The music doesn't come from your fingers,
Michael, it comes from your mind.

17:31.260 --> 17:33.220
All you have to do
is let it out.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.305
Please.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.629
Oh, my God.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.552
No, it's okay. Easy.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.307
His emotions are peaking. The
readings are getting clouded.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.641
It's okay.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.644
Relax. If you get
too emotional,

18:22.728 --> 18:24.605
it'll change the chemistry
in your brain.

18:24.772 --> 18:26.523
It'll throw the system out.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.112
You're doing great.
Come on.

18:46.794 --> 18:48.712
I need emotion to play.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.673
Concierto <i>de
</i> Aranjuez, second movement.

18:53.050 --> 18:54.551
Beautiful piece.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.429
<i>Bennett, when you
have a moment. Thank you.</i>

18:57.679 --> 19:00.682
Now, we agreed on this
a long time ago, Raymond.

19:00.766 --> 19:04.478
I wouldn't be asked to
develop combat applications.

19:04.645 --> 19:07.815
My work here is driven
by its own questions.

19:07.898 --> 19:11.443
And your work is brilliant. But
your ideas are being underutilized.

19:11.527 --> 19:14.279
Look, I think I found a way

19:14.363 --> 19:18.116
to put real revenue stream
behind your research

19:18.784 --> 19:21.870
and save thousands
of lives in the process.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.152
You're not
keeping up your end,

19:36.176 --> 19:37.511
leaving me exposed like that.

19:37.678 --> 19:39.471
Detective Murphy's
just a little impulsive.

19:39.638 --> 19:40.722
So put him on the payroll.

19:40.766 --> 19:41.966
Why are we talkin' about this?

19:41.974 --> 19:43.517
It won't work. And now that
his partner got hit,

19:43.600 --> 19:45.519
he's never gonna let it go.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.563
What is that?
Lewis' hospital.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.090
Alex is dropping by
this afternoon,

19:49.106 --> 19:51.191
in case you want
to send flowers.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.613
Yeah.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.156
I kill a cop,

19:58.240 --> 19:59.908
lookin' over my shoulder
the rest of my life.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.326
That's not good for business.

20:02.119 --> 20:04.413
Who do you think's
gonna be investigating you?

20:10.586 --> 20:12.921
I'm gonna go hard
after Lake and Daniels.

20:15.132 --> 20:17.634
I'm gonna have 'em in bracelets
within a month, man.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.270
Hey, Vallon,
I'm walking up right now.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.682
Cameras off?

20:25.058 --> 20:26.059
Clear.

20:27.352 --> 20:30.939
<i>You were right.
We should've had backup.</i>

20:31.106 --> 20:32.482
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

20:35.986 --> 20:37.821
You're not really sleeping,
are ya?

20:40.449 --> 20:41.575
Asshole.

20:43.952 --> 20:48.749
Sergeant Thomas Ryan, NYPD.
Paralyzed from the waist down.

20:49.333 --> 20:53.211
He has let himself go a
little since the accident.

20:53.378 --> 20:54.504
Pass.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.131
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

20:56.673 --> 20:59.134
Officer Alfred Miller, Denver.

20:59.635 --> 21:02.846
"Severe Cerebellar..."

21:02.930 --> 21:04.514
Cerebellar ataxia.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.266
That's why you're
the doctor, Doctor.

21:06.850 --> 21:10.520
He scored through the roof
with our urban demos.

21:10.604 --> 21:12.364
Let's keep this one
in mind. I like this guy.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.150
Very good, sir.
I saved the best for last.

21:16.693 --> 21:20.781
I give you Sergeant Jack
Freeman, masculinity incarnate.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.241
Led Pittsburgh SWAT
for five years,

21:23.325 --> 21:25.410
now confined to a wheelchair.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.957
I think I can see the appeal.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.041
NO.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.001
What? Why?

21:33.168 --> 21:36.088
Well, check the psych evaluation.
He's far too unstable.

21:36.254 --> 21:38.048
He's trying to say
that he has a temper.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.820
Have you any idea
what we'd be putting him through?

21:40.884 --> 21:44.137
The psychological strain requires
someone emotionally balanced.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.348
We have to be scientific.

21:46.515 --> 21:49.226
I mean, we're not selling
a soft drink here, are we?

21:49.393 --> 21:52.104
He's right. Okay.
Keep looking.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.942
David, what did I say?
Not until you're finished.

21:57.109 --> 21:59.111
Hey, guys.
Hi, Dad.

21:59.486 --> 22:02.072
Hey.
Hey, little monkey.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.536
How's the game, buddy?

22:07.703 --> 22:10.580
Damon got ejected, but we
got a two-man advantage.

22:10.747 --> 22:13.583
Oh, yeah?
That's fantastic.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.210
Hey, D, why don't
you head upstairs

22:15.293 --> 22:16.962
and start getting ready for bed.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.797
But he just got home.

22:19.423 --> 22:20.882
I'll be up in a second.

22:20.966 --> 22:23.427
Tuck you in, okay?
All right?

22:27.264 --> 22:29.182
Now give your mom a kiss.
Good night, baby.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.559
Too slow, boy.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.146
You're just too slow.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.238
How's Jack holding up?

22:43.405 --> 22:45.866
They said a week
till he's back on his feet.

22:46.742 --> 22:47.742
It's my fault.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.161
We shouldn't even
have been there.

22:51.830 --> 22:52.831
Here.

23:57.145 --> 23:58.939
Oh, shit, I thought
I fixed that.

23:59.106 --> 24:00.398
It'll stop.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.448
It's gonna wake up David.

24:52.200 --> 24:56.705
<i>He suffered 4th degree
burns over 80% of his body.</i>

24:57.289 --> 24:59.708
<i>Lower spine has been severed.</i>

25:00.667 --> 25:02.586
<i>If he survives,</i>

25:03.378 --> 25:07.257
he'll be paralyzed from the waist
down and confined to a wheelchair.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.720
Mrs. Murphy,

25:13.471 --> 25:15.807
we don't have to do this.

25:17.142 --> 25:20.187
I need to know everything
before I make a decision.

25:23.481 --> 25:24.941
Please continue.

25:25.942 --> 25:28.069
Vestibulocochlear,

25:28.153 --> 25:31.239
optical nerves have
been critically damaged.

25:32.282 --> 25:34.409
He'll be blind in one eye.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.494
Most likely deaf.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.706
Frankly, Dr. Norton
and the Omni Foundation

25:39.789 --> 25:41.291
are the leaders in this field.

25:41.458 --> 25:45.045
In my opinion, this is the
only chance your husband has.

25:45.212 --> 25:47.589
I'd seriously
consider their offer.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.676
I'm sorry, Doctor.

25:53.261 --> 25:54.679
I need time to think.

25:54.846 --> 25:58.767
I'm afraid, Mrs. Murphy, time
is one thing you don't have.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.649
You say you can save him,
but what does that mean?

26:08.902 --> 26:10.862
What kind of life will he have?

26:20.497 --> 26:22.749
<i>Fly</i> me to the <i>moon</i>

26:23.416 --> 26:27.128
<i>Let me play among the stars</i>

26:27.837 --> 26:30.215
Thanks.
Thanks, buddy.

26:30.382 --> 26:32.175
You know she's gonna
make me dance again.

26:32.300 --> 26:34.010
Now that I've gotta see.

26:34.177 --> 26:35.258
You don't want to see that.

26:35.262 --> 26:36.930
Here she comes now.

26:37.097 --> 26:38.223
Hold on to that.

26:38.306 --> 26:39.557
Get out there, partner.

26:41.101 --> 26:42.852
Every time.

26:46.690 --> 26:47.774
Get her, boy.

26:52.821 --> 26:55.323
<i>Fill my heart with song</i>

26:55.407 --> 26:59.744
<i>And let me sing forever more</i>

27:00.787 --> 27:03.999
<i>You are all I long for</i>

27:04.082 --> 27:06.167
<i>All I worship...</i>

27:06.251 --> 27:08.211
Subject is
still dreaming.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.131
He's retrieving memories,

27:11.214 --> 27:14.634
trying to make sense of sensorial
stimulation package 37.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.178
Perfect, Kim.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.682
Let's reconnect the spine.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.184
Time to wake him up.

27:26.855 --> 27:29.816
<i>Fill my heart with song</i>

27:29.899 --> 27:33.486
<i>Let me sing forever more</i>

27:34.821 --> 27:37.991
<i>You are all I long for</i>

27:38.074 --> 27:42.412
<i>All I worship and adore</i>

27:42.996 --> 27:45.081
<i>In other words</i>

27:45.582 --> 27:49.586
<i>Please be true</i>

27:49.669 --> 27:51.212
Excuse me?

27:51.838 --> 27:53.423
What are you doing here?

27:53.715 --> 27:55.175
Baby, where you going?

27:55.258 --> 27:58.553
<i>In other words</i>

27:58.636 --> 27:59.763
Lewis.

28:00.013 --> 28:03.725
<i>I love</i>

28:07.395 --> 28:08.730
<i>You</i>

28:10.440 --> 28:13.651
Subject regaining
cognitive functions.

28:15.528 --> 28:16.821
What's happening?

28:19.240 --> 28:20.241
Where am I?

28:20.408 --> 28:24.913
You were in an explosion, Alex.
You're in a hospital.

28:27.332 --> 28:29.834
Where's Clara? My wife.
Where's my wife?

28:30.001 --> 28:32.337
I want you to calm down,
Alex. Listen to me.

28:32.504 --> 28:36.091
You're okay. And your family's fine.
Both your wife and your son.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.385
Who the hell are you?

28:38.802 --> 28:41.554
I'm Dr. Dennett Norton.
I'm treating you.

28:42.138 --> 28:43.306
Heart rate rising.

28:46.059 --> 28:47.435
I can't move.

28:50.021 --> 28:52.607
I can't move.
What the hell is all that?

28:52.774 --> 28:53.900
Visual input unstable.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.485
I want you to relax, Alex.

28:55.568 --> 28:56.945
Subject's dumping
too much epinephrine.

28:57.028 --> 28:58.405
Should we purge it?
Not yet.

28:59.030 --> 29:01.032
Unlock vertebrae.

29:06.037 --> 29:07.372
Go ahead, Kim.

29:07.956 --> 29:10.959
Unlock upper, lower extremities.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.723
What kind of suit is this?

29:25.890 --> 29:29.394
It's not a suit, Alex.

29:31.521 --> 29:32.772
It's you.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.359
This was the only option.

29:36.526 --> 29:40.029
We're here, all of us,
to make you whole again.

29:40.655 --> 29:41.990
Full body unlock.

29:42.073 --> 29:44.451
I want you to walk now, Alex.

29:44.534 --> 29:46.119
You can do that.

30:09.893 --> 30:11.644
This seems so real.

30:14.564 --> 30:16.441
Alex,
it's very important

30:16.524 --> 30:18.109
you understand
what is happening.

30:18.276 --> 30:19.569
This is real.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.822
It's not a dream, it's not
drugs or anesthetics.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.825
I know I'm dreaming 'cause
I can feel all of this.

30:25.909 --> 30:28.953
Alex, amputees can often feel
their missing appendages.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.389
It's called
phantom limb sensation.

30:30.413 --> 30:31.664
What do you mean "amputees"?

30:32.123 --> 30:34.083
What the hell did you do to me?
You need to relax.

30:34.167 --> 30:35.460
Take this off me now.

30:35.627 --> 30:38.087
I need to get out of this thing.
What did you do to me?

30:38.463 --> 30:40.215
What have you done to me?

30:40.840 --> 30:42.717
Alex? Hey!

30:44.093 --> 30:45.094
Shut him down.

30:45.261 --> 30:47.805
No! Let him run!
Let him run!

31:08.451 --> 31:09.661
Where am I?

31:34.227 --> 31:35.728
<i>Alex, please.</i>

31:37.397 --> 31:38.565
<i>Stop-</i>

31:39.524 --> 31:41.317
<i>Alex, you have to stop.</i>

31:42.777 --> 31:43.987
<i>Please.</i>

31:45.113 --> 31:46.239
<i>Alex.</i>

31:47.782 --> 31:49.242
Please stop.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.244
Stay where you are

31:51.327 --> 31:54.163
and we'll come and pick you up.

32:27.739 --> 32:29.157
Okay, Kim.

32:30.450 --> 32:31.784
Shut him down.

32:57.727 --> 32:59.228
Alex,

32:59.937 --> 33:01.773
you can't run from this.

33:03.775 --> 33:07.945
You have to understand
the reality of the situation.

33:11.574 --> 33:12.784
Show me.

33:14.952 --> 33:16.162
Kim.

33:32.220 --> 33:33.388
Oh!

33:35.807 --> 33:36.849
No.

33:41.104 --> 33:42.605
Holy Christ.

33:43.606 --> 33:44.982
Holy Christ.

33:47.110 --> 33:49.445
Holy Christ,
there's nothing left.

33:55.576 --> 33:59.247
Your body may have gone,
but you're still here.

34:05.712 --> 34:07.422
That's not even my brain.

34:07.588 --> 34:10.717
We had to repair
the damaged areas.

34:10.882 --> 34:14.011
But we didn't interfere with
your emotion or your intellect.

34:14.429 --> 34:16.639
Do you understand me, Alex?

34:17.348 --> 34:20.101
You're in control.

34:20.935 --> 34:23.353
I'm in control?
Yes.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.400
Okay.

34:30.570 --> 34:32.905
If I'm in control,

34:34.282 --> 34:36.033
then I wanna die.

34:37.534 --> 34:42.790
Just unplug whatever it is keepin'
me alive and end this nightmare.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.168
Now, say I did that.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.879
Which as a doctor would
almost be impossible for me,

34:47.962 --> 34:49.964
but say I did.

34:51.841 --> 34:54.092
What do I say to your wife?

34:54.677 --> 34:56.304
What does she say to your son?

34:56.471 --> 34:59.140
That it didn't work.
That you tried.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.851
Somethin' went wrong.

35:02.727 --> 35:05.730
You did everything you could,

35:08.524 --> 35:10.026
but I died.

35:10.193 --> 35:12.028
So after all
they've been through,

35:12.111 --> 35:15.448
all the pain,
all their hope restored,

35:15.740 --> 35:17.742
we would just rip that away?

35:19.327 --> 35:21.329
Your wife loves you, Alex.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.581
She signed
the consent forms herself.

35:23.664 --> 35:27.001
Otherwise, you couldn't have
undergone the procedure.

35:37.178 --> 35:41.808
She loves you and she
gave you a second chance.

35:44.060 --> 35:46.604
I need you to take it.

35:50.983 --> 35:53.569
I don't wanna see myself
like this again.

35:55.154 --> 35:56.197
Even

35:56.364 --> 35:58.533
And the same goes for my family.

36:06.207 --> 36:08.000
Just put me back in.

36:12.547 --> 36:13.631
Zoom in.

36:16.050 --> 36:17.218
Stop.

36:20.137 --> 36:21.305
Zoom in.

36:23.641 --> 36:25.017
Stop.

36:30.106 --> 36:31.816
Accept the connection.

36:37.154 --> 36:39.365
<i>It's so good to finally see you.</i>

36:39.532 --> 36:41.868
I was gonna say the same thing.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.495
I'm sorry.

36:45.454 --> 36:47.832
I know how I must look to you.

36:47.999 --> 36:50.334
<i>I think you look beautiful.</i>

36:54.213 --> 36:56.132
<i>Are they treating you okay,
baby?</i>

36:56.299 --> 37:00.720
So far. Dr. Norton,
he seems like a nice guy.

37:02.179 --> 37:04.223
Does David know you're calling?

37:07.685 --> 37:09.270
<i>He misses you.</i>

37:10.021 --> 37:12.148
<i>I can go get him.
No.</i>

37:13.482 --> 37:15.693
I don't want him
to see me like this.

37:17.862 --> 37:18.946
Not yet.

37:19.238 --> 37:20.323
<i>Sure.</i>

37:26.203 --> 37:28.706
<i>We're gonna
get through this, baby.</i>

37:31.417 --> 37:33.794
<i>We're gonna make it like it was.</i>

37:38.341 --> 37:39.842
<i>When are you comin' home?</i>

37:40.009 --> 37:42.345
Well, they've still
got some tests.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.556
But they're sayin'
it's goin' really well.

37:47.475 --> 37:48.976
The minute they let me.

37:51.395 --> 37:52.939
I gotta go.

37:54.065 --> 37:55.358
I love you.

37:55.524 --> 37:57.151
End the connection.

38:11.540 --> 38:15.378
Okay, blood cleansing initiated.

38:17.171 --> 38:20.758
Viral and bacterial
screening activated.

38:23.010 --> 38:26.430
Releasing proteins, fats,

38:26.597 --> 38:29.392
minerals and carbs.

38:31.602 --> 38:36.607
Energy inflow
is at 1320 kilocalories.

38:38.192 --> 38:42.363
Now starting anti-inflammatory
corticoids, hormones

38:42.530 --> 38:45.449
and antibiotic protocols.

38:45.992 --> 38:48.077
Standard daily intake.

38:50.538 --> 38:52.623
Release antidepressants.

38:53.791 --> 38:56.127
Let's give him a nice dream.

39:06.991 --> 39:08.991
All right, here's
what you're dealin' with.

39:09.015 --> 39:11.559
Modified M2 battle rifle.

39:11.726 --> 39:14.103
.50 caliber Beowulf
ammunition at 30 round clips.

39:14.228 --> 39:16.022
Three-shot bursts
or full auto.

39:17.356 --> 39:18.399
Heavy-duty.

39:19.734 --> 39:22.862
TSR 66. Cartridge-driven
taser pistol.

39:23.029 --> 39:27.366
Each projectile releases up to 200,000
volts. It can stun, it can kill

39:27.533 --> 39:28.909
and it's nasty shit.

39:29.285 --> 39:30.327
Your armor,

39:30.411 --> 39:31.746
state-of-the-art,
but not invulnerable.

39:31.912 --> 39:34.457
.50 caliber or larger
can penetrate and kill.

39:34.623 --> 39:38.335
Multiple hits, and guess who
ends up in the recycling bin?

39:40.671 --> 39:42.551
If you sense you need a
weapon or are threatened

39:44.550 --> 39:47.678
the visor goes down and the system
makes the weapons available.

39:47.845 --> 39:50.723
But you gotta remember, it's
not the weapons that count.

39:50.806 --> 39:51.849
It's who's handling them.

39:51.932 --> 39:54.143
Or, in your case, what.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.063
You think you can do this?
Oh, just stick to your job.

39:57.188 --> 40:00.024
Just stick to my job?
Combat robots are my job, Doc.

40:00.191 --> 40:04.278
Rio, Congo, you name it, I was there.
Our machines run perfectly.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.489
You ask me, stickin'
organics into the system

40:06.572 --> 40:08.657
is a huge step backwards.

40:09.116 --> 40:11.035
I don't care how well you
designed this thing.

40:11.202 --> 40:13.496
Without my sign-off, it better
start learnin' Chinese,

40:13.579 --> 40:15.039
'cause it ain't
never goin' home.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.465
It's nice to meet you, too.

40:25.883 --> 40:27.468
Let's do this,

40:27.802 --> 40:29.095
Tin Man.

40:35.434 --> 40:39.438
Quality control,
EM-208 versus Tin Man.

40:39.605 --> 40:42.525
Rendering scenario one now.

40:43.359 --> 40:44.985
Hey, Doc, hope you don't mind.

40:45.069 --> 40:46.195
I like a little music
while I'm workin'.

40:47.613 --> 40:50.241
<i>When a man's an empty kettle</i>

40:50.407 --> 40:55.371
All right. All right, let's let the
games begin. Let's rock 'n' roll.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.541
Commence scenario.

40:58.707 --> 41:01.710
<i>Just because I'm presumin'
That I could be kind of human</i>

41:01.877 --> 41:05.089
<i>If I only had a heart</i>

41:06.215 --> 41:11.137
<i>I'd be tender, I'd be gentle
And awful sentimental</i>

41:11.303 --> 41:13.764
<i>Regarding love and art</i>

41:15.141 --> 41:17.601
<i>I'd be friends with the sparrows</i>

41:17.685 --> 41:19.770
<i>And the boy
who shoots the arrows</i>

41:19.937 --> 41:22.815
<i>If I only had a heart</i>

41:24.733 --> 41:28.404
<i>Picture me a balcony</i>

41:29.446 --> 41:32.408
<i>Above a voice sings low...</i>

41:32.616 --> 41:34.368
<i>Laggin' on the comers.</i>

41:34.451 --> 41:35.953
No, there, d'you see that?

41:36.036 --> 41:37.913
What my robot did,
that's how you do it.

41:40.249 --> 41:41.458
New product's afraid.

41:42.334 --> 41:45.671
2.3 seconds behind. Great.

41:46.968 --> 41:48.608
<i>Don't shoot! He has a gun!</i>

41:48.632 --> 41:49.675
<i>Drop your gun!</i>

41:52.136 --> 41:53.137
<i>Drop your gun!</i>

41:54.096 --> 41:55.598
<i>Drop the weapon.
Let the kid go!</i>

41:55.764 --> 41:58.934
Oh, well, it's worried that
the kid's gonna get hurt.

41:59.101 --> 42:00.603
<i>- Let the kid go!
- Too bad.</i>

42:02.146 --> 42:06.108
Well, there you have it. 5.6
seconds behind. Scenario failure.

42:06.275 --> 42:08.152
I wouldn't buy that
for a dollar.

42:13.616 --> 42:16.035
Let's do it again.
Your funeral.

42:19.830 --> 42:20.915
Detective Alex Murphy.

42:21.081 --> 42:22.291
<i>Search results.</i>

42:22.374 --> 42:24.418
<i>"Detective Murphy
making a speedy recovery."</i>

42:24.585 --> 42:26.712
<i>"Alex Murphy.
Man or Machine?"</i>

42:26.879 --> 42:30.257
<i>"Thrust into the spotlight,
Clara Murphy won't talk."</i>

42:31.300 --> 42:32.885
Antoine Vallon.

42:32.968 --> 42:34.053
<i>Search results.</i>

42:34.136 --> 42:38.265
<i>"DPD says Antoine Val/on no longer
suspect due to lack of evidence."</i>

42:41.810 --> 42:43.687
<i>Detroit Free Press.</i>

42:43.854 --> 42:46.941
<i>Unfortunately, Murphy's
investigation into Antoine Vallon</i>

42:47.024 --> 42:48.464
<i>wasn't authorized
in the first place.</i>

42:48.525 --> 42:52.238
<i>Look, Detective Murphy was
simply overzealous, okay?</i>

42:52.321 --> 42:55.449
<i>We have absolutely no evidence linking
Vallon to the attempt on his life.</i>

42:55.532 --> 42:57.826
<i>All I'm gonna say is
my partner's a great cop.</i>

42:57.910 --> 43:01.413
<i>And I won't rest until the men who tried
to kill him are brought to justice.</i>

43:05.153 --> 43:06.353
What's wrong with him?

43:06.377 --> 43:07.657
No, nothing, nothing.

43:08.629 --> 43:12.049
Watch the procedural bars
on the 208.

43:12.925 --> 43:16.428
The machine assesses
the threat and acts.

43:17.054 --> 43:18.430
That's it.

43:18.931 --> 43:21.308
It's two steps.
Now watch Alex.

43:22.351 --> 43:26.438
The software assesses the
threat, just like the robot.

43:26.605 --> 43:28.482
And it sends the information
to the brain.

43:28.649 --> 43:31.402
Alex's brain receives the information
and decides what to do with it

43:31.485 --> 43:36.115
based on his emotional cognitive
abilities like any man would.

43:36.282 --> 43:39.451
Then the brain relates this
to the Al module and...

43:39.618 --> 43:42.329
Yeah, like, you know,
a year later.

43:42.413 --> 43:43.622
And our computers
finish the job.

43:43.747 --> 43:47.459
Raymond, you wanted
a man inside a machine.

43:47.543 --> 43:49.128
And that's what you've got.

43:49.211 --> 43:51.338
But the human element
will always be present.

43:51.422 --> 43:54.008
Fear, instinct,
bias, compassion,

43:54.091 --> 43:55.342
they will always interfere
with the system!

43:55.426 --> 43:56.969
Okay, but, Dennett,

43:57.052 --> 44:00.472
I've gotta give the American people
something they can root for.

44:00.556 --> 44:02.308
Something aspirational, right?

44:02.391 --> 44:03.809
They have to
believe in this thing.

44:03.976 --> 44:07.396
"Pretty good"? I don't
know how to sell "okay."

44:07.479 --> 44:09.106
We, you and I,
have got a release date,

44:09.189 --> 44:10.607
and we've gotta make it, okay?

44:10.691 --> 44:13.277
So I don't care how you do it. I'm
askin' ya, come on, can you help me?

44:13.360 --> 44:16.822
Just get him to do that.
Get him to do that.

44:16.905 --> 44:18.324
That is a machine.

44:18.407 --> 44:19.867
I know, but it's a man
inside a machine.

44:19.950 --> 44:22.828
No, that's a man
inside a machine right there!

44:22.911 --> 44:23.996
And his life depends on it.

44:24.079 --> 44:25.456
And the future of Omnicorp
depends on it

44:25.539 --> 44:28.375
so get your ass back to China
and get it fixed.

44:28.459 --> 44:30.627
I don't care how you do it,
just go do it!

44:46.101 --> 44:49.188
It tastes like peanut butter.

44:53.150 --> 44:55.319
I can't get it out of my mouth.

44:56.028 --> 44:57.788
And you
don't like peanut butter?

44:57.946 --> 44:59.156
No.

44:59.907 --> 45:01.492
You like peanut butter, Kim?

45:01.658 --> 45:03.077
I love it.

45:04.787 --> 45:06.205
Okay.

45:07.247 --> 45:08.832
I'm gonna put you
to sleep now, Alex.

45:08.916 --> 45:10.000
Okay.

45:11.251 --> 45:13.253
Now, put him under, Kim.

45:18.634 --> 45:20.344
What are you planning to do?

45:21.303 --> 45:25.224
Consciousness is nothing more

45:25.391 --> 45:28.102
than the processing
of information.

45:29.645 --> 45:31.480
I'm gonna fix him.

45:32.898 --> 45:34.983
And he won't
know the difference.

45:46.328 --> 45:47.913
Raymond?
Yeah?

45:47.996 --> 45:51.458
We just ran focus groups
at Ryan Correctional Facility.

45:52.334 --> 45:55.421
We call this Combat Mode.

45:55.587 --> 45:58.298
It really put the fear of God
into the prisoners.

45:58.465 --> 45:59.591
Yeah, that's okay.

45:59.758 --> 46:01.510
And get a load of this.

46:02.261 --> 46:06.098
What's that? He transforms.
Kids love it.

46:06.432 --> 46:08.767
Really? Focus group
numbers through the roof.

46:08.934 --> 46:10.269
Really?
Oh, yeah.

46:10.436 --> 46:12.396
Well, that's really
embarrassing.

46:12.563 --> 46:14.523
What is this?
You know what?

46:14.690 --> 46:16.525
People really don't know
what they want

46:16.608 --> 46:18.819
until you show it to 'em
most of the time.

46:19.653 --> 46:21.905
Make him more, uh,

46:21.989 --> 46:22.990
tactical.

46:23.073 --> 46:24.616
Make him look, uh...

46:26.785 --> 46:28.537
Let's go with black.

46:29.830 --> 46:31.039
Yeah.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.201
Alex.

47:07.367 --> 47:09.453
He looks like a billion dollars.

47:09.620 --> 47:11.580
2.6 billion.

47:12.039 --> 47:13.749
Raymond Sellars.

47:14.082 --> 47:15.959
I've looked forward to
meeting you, Detective.

47:16.043 --> 47:18.128
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.

47:18.212 --> 47:20.422
Well, we funded this program

47:20.506 --> 47:22.716
to give men like you
a second chance.

47:23.550 --> 47:25.344
You just do your best today.

47:25.719 --> 47:26.970
Shall we?
Let's.

47:30.098 --> 47:32.559
Mr. Sellars, we're ready for you.
Okay, great.

47:32.726 --> 47:34.186
Chief Technician Shuman.

47:34.353 --> 47:35.729
Mornin', folks.

47:38.857 --> 47:41.068
<i>Okay, so
this is how it's gonna be.</i>

47:41.235 --> 47:43.529
We're goin' toe-to-toe.
Last man standing wins.

47:44.029 --> 47:46.240
<i>I hit you, you go back
to the drawing board.</i>

47:46.323 --> 47:48.825
<i>You hit me,
you get a ticket back home.</i>

47:49.993 --> 47:52.663
My guys are gonna be
shootin' .47 caliber rounds.

47:52.829 --> 47:54.998
Do a little damage,
but they can't take you out.

47:55.165 --> 47:58.502
But make no mistake,
Tin Man, my gun will.

48:13.934 --> 48:15.134
Alex, listen to me.

48:15.644 --> 48:17.896
<i>The EM-208s will
try to maneuver you</i>

48:17.980 --> 48:19.314
<i>so Mattox can get a clear shot.</i>

48:20.023 --> 48:22.526
<i>Do not let that happen.</i>

48:22.651 --> 48:25.988
<i>If Mattox hits you, everything but
your life support will shut down.</i>

48:26.071 --> 48:29.199
<i>You'll feel more pain than
you've ever felt in your life.</i>

48:29.533 --> 48:32.202
I don't know about that.
I've been through a lot.

48:38.250 --> 48:39.459
All right.

48:40.294 --> 48:42.170
I say we go on three.

48:42.337 --> 48:43.338
Three.

49:05.319 --> 49:06.903
How's it going down there?

49:09.031 --> 49:12.034
Whatever you do,
don't get shot in the face.

49:15.537 --> 49:16.538
Wow.

49:48.737 --> 49:51.531
Dr. Norton,
how is he doing this?

49:52.324 --> 49:55.827
His software is faster.
His hardware is stronger.

49:55.994 --> 49:57.496
<i>He's a better machine.</i>

50:00.123 --> 50:02.334
<i>But you said
humans hesitate.</i>

50:02.501 --> 50:04.795
Only when they're
making decisions.

50:04.878 --> 50:06.838
He's not making decisions?

50:07.005 --> 50:08.757
Yes and no.

50:09.132 --> 50:12.052
In his everyday life,
man rules over the machine.

50:12.135 --> 50:14.179
Alex makes his own decisions.

50:14.554 --> 50:16.390
<i>Now, when he engages in battle,</i>

50:16.473 --> 50:19.685
<i>the visor comes down
and the software takes over.</i>

50:19.851 --> 50:21.812
<i>Then the machine
does everything.</i>

50:21.895 --> 50:25.232
Alex is a passenger,
just along for the ride.

50:28.733 --> 50:30.213
<i>But if the machine
is in control,</i>

50:30.237 --> 50:31.655
<i>then how is Murphy accountable?</i>

50:31.863 --> 50:32.903
Who's pulling the trigger?

50:32.948 --> 50:34.324
Well, when the machine fights,

50:34.408 --> 50:36.910
the system releases signals
into Alex's brain

50:36.993 --> 50:39.593
making him think he's doing what
our computers are actually doing.

50:39.663 --> 50:42.499
I mean, Alex believes right
now he is in control.

50:42.582 --> 50:46.044
But he's not. It's the
illusion of free will.

50:55.762 --> 50:56.847
Crap!

51:19.202 --> 51:22.202
So you've circumvented the law by creating
a machine that thinks it's a man.

51:22.205 --> 51:23.206
But that's illegal.

51:23.373 --> 51:25.167
No. No, no, no.

51:26.293 --> 51:28.670
It's a machine that thinks
it's Alex Murphy.

51:28.837 --> 51:30.130
And in my book

51:30.630 --> 51:32.090
that's legal.

51:34.050 --> 51:35.218
Well done.

51:36.762 --> 51:38.263
Well done.

51:41.641 --> 51:46.104
Hey, Doctor, what happens if I tase an
exoskeleton with a little asshole inside?

51:47.189 --> 51:50.484
I, uh, I think we're all
curious to find out.

51:50.650 --> 51:51.985
Go ahead.

52:29.064 --> 52:31.399
If I had a pulse,
it'd be racing.

52:32.067 --> 52:34.236
She's been waiting four months.

52:34.653 --> 52:36.571
I'm sure hers is, too.

52:38.990 --> 52:40.742
You're gonna do fine.

52:50.418 --> 52:52.379
I love your sign, D.

52:55.715 --> 52:56.842
Hey.

53:01.221 --> 53:02.931
There's nothin' to be
nervous about.

53:07.686 --> 53:08.854
<i>Thank you, Bennett.</i>

53:09.729 --> 53:11.356
It's been a privilege.

54:46.159 --> 54:47.202
Hi, Dad.

54:50.163 --> 54:51.873
You know I missed you, buddy.

54:52.874 --> 54:54.209
Me, too.

55:01.383 --> 55:02.842
Wanna feel it?

55:06.721 --> 55:08.014
What is it?

55:09.391 --> 55:10.892
It's okay, sweetie.

55:22.362 --> 55:25.156
I saved all the Red Wings
games on my computer.

55:26.199 --> 55:27.575
You did?

55:30.578 --> 55:32.539
How'd they do?
I don't know.

55:32.706 --> 55:34.916
I've been waiting
to watch them with you.

55:36.334 --> 55:38.169
You know I'd love to, kiddo.

55:39.004 --> 55:40.588
But I can't tonight.

55:41.256 --> 55:43.591
You know, 'cause Daddy's
suit needs some...

55:44.759 --> 55:46.553
Some special handling.

55:48.179 --> 55:49.597
Do you understand?

56:21.004 --> 56:22.213
Thanks for coming, Jack.

56:22.464 --> 56:23.965
I heard you went home already.

56:24.049 --> 56:25.800
I know Clara must be
thrilled to have you back.

56:25.884 --> 56:28.136
I saw Clara

56:28.219 --> 56:29.471
and David.

56:32.265 --> 56:34.476
That ain't my home right now.

56:35.810 --> 56:37.896
It's in a damn lab
across the hall.

56:38.063 --> 56:39.773
I'm sorry, Alex.

56:40.148 --> 56:43.985
Startin' tomorrow, I'm gonna take
down Vallon and his whole damn crew.

56:44.069 --> 56:45.945
I was waitin'
to hear you say that.

56:50.158 --> 56:52.243
Least I know
you're the right color now.

57:25.026 --> 57:27.320
<i>Pat, the cooler
temperatures here today</i>

57:27.403 --> 57:29.572
<i>certainly have not stopped
people from showing up.</i>

57:29.656 --> 57:32.117
<i>We're expecting people
from every corner of the city</i>

57:32.200 --> 57:33.451
<i>here in Detroit</i>

57:33.535 --> 57:35.411
<i>to come out and
show their support</i>

57:35.495 --> 57:36.746
<i>for Detective Alex Murphy.</i>

57:36.830 --> 57:40.375
<i>You know, a lot of questions on people's
minds today is what will he look like.</i>

57:40.667 --> 57:42.293
<i>Is he a changed man?</i>

57:42.460 --> 57:44.129
<i>Rumor has it
he is in the building</i>

57:44.212 --> 57:45.713
<i>preparing to come out...</i>

57:46.506 --> 57:51.845
Alex, we're gonna upload the entire
DPD database into your brain.

57:52.554 --> 57:56.808
That means you'll have instantaneous
access to criminal records

57:56.891 --> 58:01.062
plus an archive of CCTV footage
from 2011 to the present.

58:01.229 --> 58:02.230
All right.

58:03.189 --> 58:04.357
Hit me.

58:04.983 --> 58:07.235
Okay. Kim,
it's all yours.

58:08.903 --> 58:11.489
Archive footage
uploading successfully.

58:11.656 --> 58:14.242
Your system draws
connections automatically.

58:14.325 --> 58:16.161
It will link perpetrators
to their crimes

58:16.244 --> 58:19.581
and give you their exact
locations whenever available.

58:20.206 --> 58:23.418
I got evidence
to make 138... No, no.

58:23.751 --> 58:25.920
166 arrests.

58:26.671 --> 58:28.631
His emotions are stable.

58:30.258 --> 58:31.843
This is incredible.

58:32.385 --> 58:35.013
<i>You will notice his family
is here in the building as well.</i>

58:35.096 --> 58:37.182
<i>The mayor is standing
onstage behind me.</i>

58:37.265 --> 58:39.434
<i>Also, Raymond Sellars
from Omnicorp.</i>

58:39.517 --> 58:40.768
<i>They seem like great friends</i>

58:40.852 --> 58:43.771
<i>obviously echoing the partnership
that they've brought together.</i>

58:45.023 --> 58:46.423
How much longer
will this take?

58:46.441 --> 58:49.527
Well, the feed from the
database is almost clone, so.

58:49.694 --> 58:51.279
We're approaching present day.

58:51.362 --> 58:54.866
634 pending arrests.

58:54.949 --> 58:57.368
We're gonna need
a bigger prison.

58:59.787 --> 59:00.955
He's on top of her.

59:01.039 --> 59:02.874
Dr. Norton,
he's getting too emotional.

59:02.957 --> 59:04.542
I gotta do something!
Alex.

59:04.626 --> 59:06.794
Alex, calm down.

59:07.295 --> 59:08.713
Take a breath.

59:08.963 --> 59:10.381
Relax.

59:10.632 --> 59:11.883
Kim, what are the readings?

59:11.966 --> 59:13.760
I haven't seen him
at levels like this.

59:13.927 --> 59:15.011
- He's gonna shoot 'em!
- Alex!

59:15.261 --> 59:17.513
Alex, Alex, relax.

59:18.473 --> 59:19.474
Relax.

59:20.475 --> 59:21.476
Alex?

59:22.143 --> 59:24.223
What is this?
This just a computer glitch?

59:24.312 --> 59:26.064
No. That's
his own crime scene.

59:26.147 --> 59:27.148
Alex!

59:27.232 --> 59:28.233
He's spiking
all over the place.

59:28.316 --> 59:29.484
Alex!

59:30.151 --> 59:31.903
The system
is crashing, Doctor.

59:32.070 --> 59:33.154
Alex, can you hear me?

59:33.738 --> 59:34.739
Alex! Alex!

59:34.814 --> 59:37.134
I'm not sure he can handle this.
I gotta do something!

59:37.158 --> 59:38.279
He's emotionally overloaded.

59:38.409 --> 59:39.410
Unlock me!

59:39.577 --> 59:40.995
Alex! Stop!

59:41.496 --> 59:43.122
Stop! He's having a seizure!

59:43.289 --> 59:45.166
Kim, shut him down! Alex!

59:45.500 --> 59:46.501
Get me a live feed!

59:46.584 --> 59:47.752
I can't do it.
Dr. Norton's with the patient.

59:47.835 --> 59:48.836
Do it now!

59:49.003 --> 59:50.129
Jesus Christ!

59:50.296 --> 59:51.923
Dr. Norton! Dr. Norton!

59:52.090 --> 59:53.466
What?
The press is waiting!

59:53.633 --> 59:54.634
We have to get him up there now!

59:54.717 --> 59:55.843
What do you want me to do?

59:55.927 --> 59:58.805
I don't know! Fix him!
Do what you have to do!

59:58.888 --> 01:00:02.225
Your reputation is on the line
every bit as much as ours.

01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:05.186
We're running out of time.

01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:07.272
Okay.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.108
Everybody out!

01:00:11.693 --> 01:00:12.694
Out!

01:00:12.777 --> 01:00:14.279
<i>Mayor Durant is
about to take to the stage</i>

01:00:14.362 --> 01:00:17.949
and introduce Detroit's newest
weapon in the war on crime.

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:21.286
I'm actually getting word that
he's ready to go right now.

01:00:25.832 --> 01:00:28.084
Heart rate rising. He
might start spiking, Doctor.

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:30.795
Set modules to absorb
dopamine and noradrenalin.

01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:32.046
But you will be
taking away his emotions.

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:33.881
Drop the levels
until I tell you to stop.

01:00:33.965 --> 01:00:35.967
Doctor, you'll be taking away
his ability to feel anything.

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.677
Now, please!

01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:45.560
Pull the footage.
Put it on a loop.

01:00:47.895 --> 01:00:49.397
Dopamine level's at 20%.

01:00:49.564 --> 01:00:50.565
More.

01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:54.319
Dopamine
level's at 10%.

01:00:54.402 --> 01:00:55.528
More.

01:00:56.571 --> 01:00:58.364
Dopamine level's at 5%.
Lower.

01:00:58.531 --> 01:01:00.408
You're flattening him out.
Lower!

01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:05.079
2%.
Hold it there.

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:13.421
Alex?

01:01:14.756 --> 01:01:16.758
Alex, how do you feel?

01:01:20.762 --> 01:01:22.847
I feel fine, Dr. Norton.

01:01:24.557 --> 01:01:28.936
Well, today I'm not here to
talk about crime prevention.

01:01:29.437 --> 01:01:32.732
I am here to give you the cure.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.380
That's right!

01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:42.742
Hi, Dad!

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:46.204
Dad?

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:55.880
Ladies and gentlemen,
the revolution begins right now

01:01:56.047 --> 01:01:58.966
with Detective Alex Murphy!

01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:17.026
Detective.

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:34.335
- What's he doing?
- He looks like a zombie.

01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:37.338
I think he's
accessing criminal data.

01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:45.972
Thomas King!
You are under arrest!

01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:07.743
Until today, Thomas King
was a convicted felon

01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:11.372
wanted for rape, arson,
and murder.

01:03:11.664 --> 01:03:15.543
This man has torn
apart American families.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.255
On the loose for six years.

01:03:20.465 --> 01:03:25.553
And where was this
criminal mastermind hiding?

01:03:28.723 --> 01:03:33.686
Right in front of
the police headquarters.

01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:38.399
Here he is, just steps away
from two of Detroit's finest.

01:03:38.566 --> 01:03:42.487
These two officers
are completely unaware

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:45.573
of the monster in their midst.

01:03:47.867 --> 01:03:50.453
And then, in 60 seconds...

01:03:50.578 --> 01:03:54.540
I repeat, just 60 seconds,

01:03:54.707 --> 01:03:58.211
Detective Murphy
brings him down.

01:03:58.294 --> 01:04:02.173
<i>If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.</i>

01:04:03.007 --> 01:04:08.137
This, my friends, is the
future of American justice.

01:04:08.763 --> 01:04:11.974
How many like Thomas King
will pay for their crimes

01:04:12.058 --> 01:04:15.228
now that RoboCop is here?

01:04:16.062 --> 01:04:17.188
Yes,

01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:21.776
let's not shy away
from what this means, people.

01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:26.197
Men weren't up to the task.

01:04:26.364 --> 01:04:27.823
But Alex Murphy,

01:04:28.199 --> 01:04:30.159
a <i>robot cop,</i>

01:04:30.243 --> 01:04:31.285
<i>was.</i>

01:04:32.578 --> 01:04:33.871
We can't take him
off the street.

01:04:33.955 --> 01:04:35.498
This is what I'm saying.
He's a hit.

01:04:35.581 --> 01:04:37.291
A big, fat, stinking hit.

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:39.627
Yeah, until he breaks down
in front of everyone.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:42.922
Hey, we all knew there would be issues.
It's inevitable.

01:04:43.089 --> 01:04:45.675
Dennett, you're my guy. I just
need you to get a handle on this.

01:04:45.758 --> 01:04:46.918
I know, but I need more time.

01:04:46.968 --> 01:04:49.470
Scientifically,
we're in uncharted water.

01:04:49.554 --> 01:04:51.722
We need to take him
backtothelab and do more tests.

01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:55.226
I mean, it was like something was
interfering with our system.

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:57.728
Something beyond
chemistry or physics.

01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:59.730
Like what? His soul?

01:04:59.814 --> 01:05:02.316
Hey, look, this train has
already left the station.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.694
I can't exactly go out
to the world and say,

01:05:04.777 --> 01:05:07.280
"Sorry, I released
a defective product."

01:05:07.446 --> 01:05:10.324
So, no matter what we do, we just
need to keep him on the streets.

01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:12.076
What about the interviews?

01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:14.579
Cancel 'em.
Cancel all of 'em.

01:05:14.745 --> 01:05:16.080
Everything.

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:18.499
In fact, Dennett.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.838
<i>Let's keep the wife at a
distance for now, as well.</i>

01:05:25.006 --> 01:05:26.446
<i>I'd like to see him.</i>

01:05:27.133 --> 01:05:28.467
Can you arrange that?

01:05:28.634 --> 01:05:30.469
Look, I won't lie to you.

01:05:31.012 --> 01:05:34.432
Alex was so nervous,
we had to sedate him.

01:05:34.599 --> 01:05:37.268
I looked in his eyes and
I couldn't see my husband.

01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:41.314
And then he just shoots a man in front
of our son. That's not sedation.

01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:45.651
He's responding
to drugs differently now.

01:05:47.653 --> 01:05:49.989
We both knew from day one,

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:53.159
there would be complications.

01:05:57.455 --> 01:05:59.498
Just give me a little more time.

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:02.043
I promise,

01:06:03.169 --> 01:06:05.171
you'll have your husband back.

01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:11.177
This goes for every
squad in every department.

01:06:11.344 --> 01:06:14.805
Detective Murphy will have full
access to all investigations.

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:17.516
Robberies, narcotics, homicides.

01:06:17.683 --> 01:06:20.144
If he requests
to take over a case,

01:06:20.227 --> 01:06:21.812
the case will be handed to him.

01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:23.731
No arguments, no complaints.

01:06:23.898 --> 01:06:24.899
This is bullshit!

01:06:25.066 --> 01:06:28.861
I said no complaints!
And I mean it. Now...

01:06:29.695 --> 01:06:32.573
Good morning, Chief Dean.
Good morning, officers.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.868
I've selected 13 targets for
today, all wanted for murder.

01:06:36.243 --> 01:06:37.912
John Biggs is target number one.

01:06:38.079 --> 01:06:39.413
I'll be taking over this case.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.332
Ambulances, detention
vehicles, and coroners

01:06:41.415 --> 01:06:44.001
should be ready to
move in on my request.

01:06:44.168 --> 01:06:46.212
I wish you all a very good day.

01:06:53.552 --> 01:06:54.762
Murphy.

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:56.847
You okay, man?

01:06:58.724 --> 01:07:00.393
I'm fine, Sergeant.

01:07:00.935 --> 01:07:02.728
Can't wait to get back to work.

01:07:02.895 --> 01:07:04.689
Lake and Daniels are in there
shittin' their pants...

01:07:04.772 --> 01:07:06.440
Excuse me, I have casework.

01:07:59.326 --> 01:08:00.995
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:09.295
Walter Karrel,
look at me.

01:08:09.462 --> 01:08:10.755
You have two options.

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:11.922
Option one.

01:08:12.965 --> 01:08:14.842
I shoot you with 50,000 volts

01:08:15.009 --> 01:08:18.345
which may cause respiratory
failure, organ malfunction,

01:08:18.429 --> 01:08:20.848
internal burns, and loss of
bowel and bladder control.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.725
And then I arrest you.

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:24.350
Option two.
You tell me where

01:08:24.435 --> 01:08:26.770
John Biggs' drug lab is located.

01:08:26.854 --> 01:08:28.939
And then I arrest you.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.984
You have two seconds to decide.

01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:42.011
Totally justifiable.

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:44.430
We are going to make
a lot of money.

01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:48.269
Nothing. No fear.
No increase in heart rate.

01:09:48.435 --> 01:09:51.772
No traces of anger whatsoever.

01:09:52.022 --> 01:09:54.358
Congratulations, Doctor.

01:09:54.692 --> 01:09:56.026
You did it.

01:09:57.278 --> 01:09:58.779
Yes, I did.

01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:08.414
<i>I told you, sir.</i>

01:10:08.581 --> 01:10:11.375
Norton clearly never had
control of the product.

01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:14.461
I agree. And that's
why I called you here.

01:10:14.753 --> 01:10:17.464
I just want a second pair of
eyes on this thing, that's all.

01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:18.632
Okay.

01:10:18.799 --> 01:10:20.676
I'll need a feed
from the Tin Man's head

01:10:20.801 --> 01:10:23.042
plus full surveillance of the lab, and...

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:25.472
You're gonna have
full access to everything.

01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:27.474
If anything comes up,

01:10:27.558 --> 01:10:29.268
I'm gonna be in Washington.

01:10:33.314 --> 01:10:34.607
<i>He brought peace</i>

01:10:34.773 --> 01:10:37.234
<i>to this country's
most violent city.</i>

01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:38.485
<i>He showed us all</i>

01:10:38.652 --> 01:10:41.655
<i>that Detroit and America
can have a brighter future.</i>

01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:45.659
<i>A future of economic growth,
freedom, and happiness.</i>

01:10:45.993 --> 01:10:49.997
On tonight's show,
a visionary and true patriot.

01:10:50.164 --> 01:10:53.751
The CEO of Omnicorp,
Raymond Sellars.

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.171
Hello, Pat.
Raymond.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.255
Thanks for havin' me.

01:10:58.422 --> 01:11:00.925
You must be doing
a victory lap about now.

01:11:01.008 --> 01:11:02.009
Well.

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:06.013
Two weeks ago, Omni's stock
went through the roof.

01:11:06.138 --> 01:11:08.432
And the Senate
has finally agreed

01:11:08.515 --> 01:11:10.476
to vote on the repeal
of the Dreyfus Act.

01:11:10.643 --> 01:11:14.021
Well, look, I mean, the
tide is definitely turning.

01:11:14.188 --> 01:11:17.024
I just feel certain that soon we'll
be keeping all Americans safe.

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:18.108
I certainly hope so.

01:11:18.484 --> 01:11:21.445
But, I think our next guest will
have a different point of view.

01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:22.529
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:22.863 --> 01:11:23.989
Hubert Dreyfus.

01:11:24.531 --> 01:11:26.367
Senator,
thank you for joining us.

01:11:26.533 --> 01:11:28.243
<i>Hello, Pat.
Mr. Sellars.</i>

01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:30.621
Senator, do you know
what this is?

01:11:30.788 --> 01:11:33.540
The American public is divided

01:11:33.666 --> 01:11:35.042
on the Dreyfus Act.

01:11:35.209 --> 01:11:40.339
Our polls at Novakelement.com
are tight at 50-50.

01:11:40.547 --> 01:11:44.301
<i>There is no doubt
Omnicorp created a sensation</i>

01:11:44.385 --> 01:11:47.805
<i>but this bill is
not about Alex Murphy.</i>

01:11:47.972 --> 01:11:50.933
<i>It's about whether America's
willing to give robots</i>

01:11:51.016 --> 01:11:52.643
<i>the authority over human lives.</i>

01:11:52.726 --> 01:11:54.311
No. Look, look, look.

01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:57.064
This sea change
we're witnessing,

01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:58.565
and it is a sea change,

01:11:58.649 --> 01:12:00.317
shows that Americans
don't really care

01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:03.153
if our law enforcement systems
are manned or unmanned.

01:12:03.237 --> 01:12:06.281
What they care about is efficiency
and they care about safety.

01:12:06.365 --> 01:12:07.616
<i>You're clouding the issue.</i>

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.243
<i>This is clearly an attempt</i>

01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:11.745
<i>to sway public opinion
with a marketing stunt.</i>

01:12:11.912 --> 01:12:13.247
What's clear is

01:12:13.414 --> 01:12:16.875
that with just one system in
place, we've cut crime by 80%.

01:12:16.959 --> 01:12:19.003
Just imagine if we put,

01:12:19.086 --> 01:12:21.296
I dunno, let's say
100 systems in place.

01:12:21.547 --> 01:12:23.424
And then,
I want you to ask yourself,

01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:25.300
why are you holding us back?

01:12:25.384 --> 01:12:26.864
<i>Is that your plan?
Thank you, Senator.</i>

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:28.512
And thank you, Raymond.
Thank you, Pat.

01:12:28.929 --> 01:12:31.598
Well, there you have it.

01:12:32.266 --> 01:12:34.184
Who could argue with that?

01:12:34.268 --> 01:12:36.228
Which begs the question.

01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:41.483
Has the US Senate
become pro-crime?

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.327
Yeah, hi.

01:12:52.494 --> 01:12:54.121
No, no, 5000.

01:12:54.621 --> 01:12:55.956
Call me tomorrow.

01:12:57.374 --> 01:13:00.627
Hey, guys. Vallon's
waitin' for you inside.

01:13:02.129 --> 01:13:03.505
What, you too busy
to walk us in?

01:13:03.589 --> 01:13:05.049
I'm out here makin' money.

01:13:05.299 --> 01:13:08.052
Where are my trip wires?
I gotta do this myself?

01:13:08.469 --> 01:13:10.949
What the hell is all this shit?

01:13:10.971 --> 01:13:12.222
I can't move any product

01:13:12.306 --> 01:13:13.807
with this thing on the streets.

01:13:14.516 --> 01:13:16.018
What are you doing
to protect me?

01:13:16.185 --> 01:13:18.145
Relax. The guy's
a walkin' zombie.

01:13:18.312 --> 01:13:19.813
And tell me your phones are off.

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.149
He's not going after you.
We covered our tracks.

01:13:22.316 --> 01:13:24.485
He can't manufacture
evidence outta thin air.

01:13:24.651 --> 01:13:26.361
If he does, I'm ready for him.

01:13:35.079 --> 01:13:36.163
Well?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.335
I've been getting calls.

01:13:41.502 --> 01:13:42.669
From whom?

01:13:43.337 --> 01:13:44.713
Well, Clara.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.509
You need to let her see her husband.
She has rights.

01:13:49.259 --> 01:13:52.054
That's not your decision.
That's Legal's call.

01:13:52.387 --> 01:13:54.723
Yeah, but it's only
a question of time

01:13:54.807 --> 01:13:56.683
before she turns up
on television.

01:13:57.017 --> 01:13:58.519
Well, she can try.

01:13:59.186 --> 01:14:02.064
I'll issue a gag order before
I let her see her husband.

01:14:03.524 --> 01:14:04.900
I'd hop to it.

01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:08.320
Alex. Alex!

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:13.492
Alex. You need to come home.

01:14:13.659 --> 01:14:15.035
Clara, please stand aside.

01:14:15.202 --> 01:14:16.537
You need to speak to your son.

01:14:16.703 --> 01:14:18.664
Right now, I see three
crimes in progress.

01:14:18.831 --> 01:14:20.249
Alex, listen to me.

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:22.709
I know you're in there.

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:27.381
David won't show
his face at school.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.842
He's having nightmares.

01:14:31.677 --> 01:14:34.388
He's falling apart.
Lam falling apart.

01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:36.890
Please.

01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:40.769
I can't do this on my own.

01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:44.398
He's been scared
ever since that night.

01:14:53.866 --> 01:14:55.346
<i>What do you think
she's gonna do?</i>

01:14:56.201 --> 01:14:57.744
What's he gonna do?

01:15:18.599 --> 01:15:19.933
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.102
<i>David? David.</i>

01:15:22.936 --> 01:15:25.272
<i>Stand back.
Come on, stand back!</i>

01:15:45.751 --> 01:15:47.794
He's supposed to be
watching this.

01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:52.549
Instead, he's accessing images of
Clara and David arriving at school.

01:15:52.633 --> 01:15:53.926
Over and over again.

01:15:54.509 --> 01:15:58.680
Somehow, he's overriding
the system's priorities.

01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:11.276
<i>- Do you want me to shut him down?
- No.</i>

01:16:11.443 --> 01:16:12.819
Not yet.

01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:16.031
I wanna see what happens.

01:16:35.968 --> 01:16:37.886
What's he doing
at his house?

01:16:40.013 --> 01:16:42.057
Look, he's disobeying protocol.

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.392
You have to shut him down.

01:16:43.684 --> 01:16:46.645
As far as I can tell,
he's still doing his job.

01:17:46.288 --> 01:17:48.915
Adrian, give me
an image of his brain.

01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:53.128
He's undoing what we did to him.

01:17:53.587 --> 01:17:56.256
His dopamine levels
are coming back to normal.

01:17:56.423 --> 01:17:58.884
How is that even possible?

01:18:00.093 --> 01:18:02.387
I haven't the faintest idea.

01:18:02.763 --> 01:18:04.097
<i>Alex.</i>

01:18:30.582 --> 01:18:32.959
<i>Alex, please return
to the station.</i>

01:18:34.002 --> 01:18:35.796
I wanna run some tests.

01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:38.298
Well, this should
be interesting.

01:18:55.184 --> 01:18:56.584
<i>And your phone
on the table!</i>

01:18:56.608 --> 01:18:58.819
We're not cops, all right?
We work for Antoine Vallon.

01:18:58.985 --> 01:19:01.196
- Whoa!
- What'd you say?

01:19:01.988 --> 01:19:03.824
We work for Antoine Vallon.

01:19:32.686 --> 01:19:33.979
My hand, man!

01:19:34.062 --> 01:19:35.230
Where's Antoine Vallon?

01:19:35.355 --> 01:19:36.565
You broke my hand, man!

01:19:37.357 --> 01:19:39.234
I know you remember me, Jerry.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.448
Where's Vallon?

01:19:44.531 --> 01:19:45.615
Wait a minute.

01:19:45.699 --> 01:19:48.179
If I tell you where Vallon is,
he'll kill my wife and kid, man.

01:19:49.995 --> 01:19:53.248
Your wife left you in 2019 after
filing charges for domestic abuse.

01:19:53.331 --> 01:19:55.208
And you don't have a kid.

01:19:55.667 --> 01:19:56.667
Butldo.

01:19:58.253 --> 01:19:59.504
I'm not askin' again!

01:19:59.671 --> 01:20:01.832
Look, I swear, man. I don't
know where Vallon is, okay?

01:20:01.923 --> 01:20:05.260
The only guy I talk to is his driver
Marcus. That's it, man. That's it!

01:20:05.844 --> 01:20:07.721
Does he have a phone number?

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:27.282
We have a problem.
Alex is breaking protocol.

01:20:27.449 --> 01:20:28.450
What's he doing?

01:20:28.617 --> 01:20:30.744
He's off solving his own murder.

01:20:30.911 --> 01:20:33.663
Oh, that is genius.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.707
Why didn't I think Of that?

01:20:42.756 --> 01:20:44.257
<i>How long
till he gets here?</i>

01:20:44.424 --> 01:20:46.426
<i>Five minutes.
All</i> right.

01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:48.470
Johnny, you stay
on these monitors.

01:20:48.637 --> 01:20:49.930
What happened?

01:20:51.223 --> 01:20:53.934
Some idiot used
an unencrypted phone.

01:20:55.268 --> 01:20:56.394
Shit.

01:21:04.653 --> 01:21:06.279
All right, everyone, listen up!

01:21:06.655 --> 01:21:07.948
He's coming.

01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:10.951
He leaves alive, you don't.

01:21:12.118 --> 01:21:13.787
How do we stop him?

01:21:15.163 --> 01:21:18.333
.50 caliber and above.
Aim for the head.

01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:31.805
This one's set.

01:21:32.097 --> 01:21:33.265
Let's go. Go!

01:21:33.431 --> 01:21:34.766
All right, move! Let's go!

01:21:36.142 --> 01:21:37.978
Come on. Come on!

01:21:39.771 --> 01:21:40.772
Ready to go!

01:21:41.815 --> 01:21:43.149
They're all set.

01:23:11.112 --> 01:23:12.405
Finish it!

01:23:26.795 --> 01:23:28.088
You freak, die!

01:24:17.345 --> 01:24:18.638
Watch out.

01:24:18.972 --> 01:24:20.432
Need me
to call a doctor?

01:24:20.598 --> 01:24:22.600
Come on, Jack.
You're gonna like this.

01:24:25.311 --> 01:24:26.471
What the hell you doin' here?

01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:27.840
Y'all gonna play
good cop, bad cop?

01:24:27.856 --> 01:24:30.567
Nah, Daniels.
Bad cop, RoboCop.

01:24:32.527 --> 01:24:35.655
I've recovered 26
guns from Vallon's warehouse.

01:24:35.822 --> 01:24:38.616
Thirteen serial numbers match
weapons missing from Evidence.

01:24:38.783 --> 01:24:40.618
And I got your prints
all over 'em.

01:24:40.785 --> 01:24:41.786
This is bullshit.

01:24:41.953 --> 01:24:43.747
I also
have CCTV footage

01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.832
of you and Vallon the same
day he tried to kill me.

01:24:45.999 --> 01:24:48.168
<i>So put him on the payroll.
Why we talkin' about this?</i>

01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:51.629
<i>It won't work. Now that his partner
got hit, he's never gonna let it go.</i>

01:24:51.796 --> 01:24:53.214
<i>- What is that?</i>
<i>- Lewis' hospital.</i>

01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:54.841
<i>Murphy's dropping by
this afternoon.</i>

01:24:55.008 --> 01:24:57.886
<i>I kill a cop, I'm lookin'
over my shoulder...</i>

01:24:58.052 --> 01:25:00.346
You know what they do
to cops in prison, man?

01:25:00.805 --> 01:25:03.391
Being locked up with the
same dudes you put in there?

01:25:06.728 --> 01:25:08.438
How long you think
before he gives you up?

01:25:12.192 --> 01:25:14.861
Don't shoot me. Okay?

01:25:15.862 --> 01:25:18.198
I swear to Christ.
It was Dean.

01:25:18.364 --> 01:25:21.242
She helped pull those guns.
Just don't shoot me.

01:25:23.203 --> 01:25:25.205
Thank you for your cooperation.

01:25:27.332 --> 01:25:28.875
You can cuff him now, Jack.

01:25:37.967 --> 01:25:39.844
Now I know why we
couldn't get an arrest.

01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:43.264
'Cause Vallon was protected
from up on high.

01:25:43.348 --> 01:25:45.058
Alex, I can explain.

01:25:45.725 --> 01:25:47.101
You tipped him off today.

01:25:47.185 --> 01:25:48.436
Come on, man.
Don't do this.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.438
You tried to kill me twice.

01:25:50.522 --> 01:25:53.817
I trusted you.
And you destroyed my family.

01:25:54.108 --> 01:25:55.109
Confess.

01:25:56.444 --> 01:25:58.112
Now, in front of everyone.

01:25:58.238 --> 01:25:59.239
Confess!

01:26:09.082 --> 01:26:10.083
What happened?

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:12.377
Tin Man is down.
Had to be done.

01:26:12.544 --> 01:26:13.545
<i>Why?</i>

01:26:13.711 --> 01:26:14.963
Product shot a corrupt cop.

01:26:15.046 --> 01:26:16.506
Two more seconds,
the chief's brains

01:26:16.589 --> 01:26:19.092
would've been splattered
across the 6:00 news.

01:26:19.551 --> 01:26:20.635
We got anything on her?

01:26:20.802 --> 01:26:23.137
Well, she's the Chief of
the Detroit Police Department.

01:26:23.221 --> 01:26:25.098
What do you think?

01:26:28.935 --> 01:26:30.228
You know what?

01:26:31.646 --> 01:26:34.899
This might actually tip this
thing right into the net.

01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:44.492
<i>Alex, I don't
know if you can hear me.</i>

01:26:44.784 --> 01:26:48.079
<i>But tonight,
you uncovered a nest of vipers</i>

01:26:48.246 --> 01:26:50.665
<i>inside
the Detroit Police Department.</i>

01:26:50.832 --> 01:26:55.169
<i>And in so doing, you shed
light on an invaluable truth.</i>

01:26:55.795 --> 01:26:57.255
Even the police,

01:26:57.338 --> 01:27:01.342
the men and women
who swore to keep us safe,

01:27:02.135 --> 01:27:03.636
they can be bribed.

01:27:04.262 --> 01:27:07.140
They can be bought.

01:27:08.766 --> 01:27:12.896
Machines, however,
are corruption free.

01:27:13.855 --> 01:27:16.065
Americans could be
living in a country

01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:19.485
where law enforcement
is not only efficient,

01:27:19.819 --> 01:27:21.321
but incorruptible.

01:27:22.655 --> 01:27:24.949
Thank you, Alex,
for all you've done.

01:27:25.116 --> 01:27:26.826
And for all that you are.

01:27:27.327 --> 01:27:30.496
<i>Detective Murphy is currently
in critical condition.</i>

01:27:31.164 --> 01:27:33.917
Our doctors
are working ceaselessly

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.753
but, at this time, it is
unclear if he will survive.

01:27:38.046 --> 01:27:40.048
<i>Ms. Kline,
how do you think the attempt</i>

01:27:40.131 --> 01:27:42.008
<i>on Detective Alex Murphy's life</i>

01:27:42.091 --> 01:27:44.385
<i>will affect tomorrow's vote
for the Dreyfus Act?</i>

01:27:44.469 --> 01:27:46.346
<i>At this time,
Omnicorp's sole concern</i>

01:27:46.429 --> 01:27:48.514
<i>is the full recovery
of Detective Murphy.</i>

01:27:49.641 --> 01:27:51.809
<i>How many times
does Detective Murphy</i>

01:27:51.893 --> 01:27:54.312
<i>have to give his life
for his country?</i>

01:27:54.979 --> 01:27:59.817
<i>I sincerely hope the Senate
makes the right vote tomorrow</i>

01:27:59.901 --> 01:28:04.489
<i>so that Alex Murphy's sacrifices
will not have been in vain.</i>

01:28:09.202 --> 01:28:11.454
<i>Senator Dreyfus is my friend.</i>

01:28:11.537 --> 01:28:14.332
<i>He has been
my mentor and my strength</i>

01:28:14.415 --> 01:28:16.876
<i>in times of difficulty
on this floor.</i>

01:28:17.377 --> 01:28:20.463
<i>But despite all that,
I work for the state of Ohio,</i>

01:28:20.546 --> 01:28:23.675
<i>and the safety of its citizens
is my top priority.</i>

01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:25.093
<i>So I vote yes.</i>

01:28:25.259 --> 01:28:27.553
<i>The Dreyfus Act
must be repealed.</i>

01:28:27.887 --> 01:28:30.056
That's us ahead, 39 to 10.

01:28:30.223 --> 01:28:33.142
I spoke to the Senate liaison and
it looks like it's in the bag,

01:28:33.226 --> 01:28:36.312
but we still have to tread
carefully with the politicians.

01:28:37.897 --> 01:28:40.149
<i>We're here live
at DPD headquarters</i>

01:28:40.233 --> 01:28:42.986
<i>where moments ago, Clara Murphy
made a shocking statement.</i>

01:28:43.069 --> 01:28:44.278
What the hell?

01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:49.409
<i>Omnicorp has denied me and my
son access to Alex for weeks.</i>

01:28:50.076 --> 01:28:51.911
<i>I demand to know why.</i>

01:28:52.912 --> 01:28:57.917
<i>This treatment is inhuman and somebody
needs to be held accountable.</i>

01:28:59.127 --> 01:29:00.920
Oh, we're fucked.

01:29:01.087 --> 01:29:02.463
No, we only need 12 votes.

01:29:02.547 --> 01:29:04.048
She shouldn't make
much difference.

01:29:04.215 --> 01:29:06.426
Yeah, but what about
after the vote?

01:29:06.509 --> 01:29:08.389
I mean, those two should
not be allowed contact.

01:29:08.428 --> 01:29:10.847
If she starts
putting ideas in his head...

01:29:10.972 --> 01:29:13.641
Bring her in.
I'll handle the explanation.

01:29:13.808 --> 01:29:15.268
And what about Alex?

01:29:15.351 --> 01:29:17.603
You know, unfortunately,
we can'tjust keep him on ice.

01:29:18.271 --> 01:29:20.831
The shooting at the station
spooked some of the politicians.

01:29:20.898 --> 01:29:23.401
They're our clients.
We have to take care of them.

01:29:23.568 --> 01:29:26.988
They're fine when a machine
is lowering the murder rate,

01:29:27.071 --> 01:29:30.366
but when a man is investigating
city politics, they get nervous.

01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:32.827
All right. First off,
it's not a man, okay?

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.871
It's property of Omnicorp.

01:29:34.954 --> 01:29:37.206
And politics are
the least of your concern.

01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:38.958
I mean, this thing
solved its own murder.

01:29:39.042 --> 01:29:41.562
How long till it realizes you
haven't been on the level with it?

01:29:41.586 --> 01:29:42.712
If that happens,

01:29:42.795 --> 01:29:45.715
every journalist in this country
is dying to speak to him.

01:29:45.798 --> 01:29:47.759
I mean, we created a hero.

01:29:48.301 --> 01:29:50.970
What happens
when he opens his mouth?

01:29:54.474 --> 01:29:56.184
What's bigger than a hero?

01:30:07.862 --> 01:30:09.155
Dead hero.

01:30:13.493 --> 01:30:15.453
Get me Dr. Norton.

01:30:24.504 --> 01:30:25.630
What is this, Raymond?

01:30:26.756 --> 01:30:30.760
You have Mattox spying on me and now this
bullshit about a "critical condition"?

01:30:30.927 --> 01:30:33.638
You know and I know
Alex is fine!

01:30:33.805 --> 01:30:34.972
Calm down.

01:30:35.139 --> 01:30:36.641
<i>Bennett.</i>

01:30:36.768 --> 01:30:38.048
Your work is so good, I don't...

01:30:38.059 --> 01:30:39.393
Well, now,
this is not about my work!

01:30:39.477 --> 01:30:41.395
You saw the woman on TV!

01:30:41.562 --> 01:30:43.689
This has to stop!

01:30:45.525 --> 01:30:46.818
You're right.

01:30:47.527 --> 01:30:49.529
But let me
ask you something, Dennett.

01:30:49.695 --> 01:30:52.115
What kind of life have we
really given Alex Murphy?

01:30:52.198 --> 01:30:55.743
He's never gonna be a normal
man, a father, a husband.

01:30:55.827 --> 01:30:59.080
By the time we put the other units
on the street, he's just...

01:30:59.247 --> 01:31:00.331
<i>Bennett.</i>

01:31:02.208 --> 01:31:03.709
Let's face it.

01:31:04.544 --> 01:31:06.045
We failed him.

01:31:07.505 --> 01:31:09.423
We failed Alex Murphy.

01:31:09.507 --> 01:31:11.134
But I want you to think
about the bigger picture

01:31:11.217 --> 01:31:12.778
because that's what
we're talking about.

01:31:12.844 --> 01:31:15.596
The work you've done with him is
gonna be studied for decades.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.890
You've changed
the face of history, Dennett.

01:31:17.974 --> 01:31:22.270
No policeman is ever going to
die in the line of duty again

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:24.564
because of you.

01:31:26.232 --> 01:31:27.692
You think about that.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.163
I want that family taken care of

01:31:40.246 --> 01:31:41.747
beyond their wildest dreams.

01:31:41.789 --> 01:31:43.875
We owe them that.
I agree.

01:31:44.625 --> 01:31:47.962
I want full funding.
Ten years.

01:31:48.379 --> 01:31:50.047
New staff, all my own people.

01:31:50.214 --> 01:31:51.757
Fantastic.

01:31:52.466 --> 01:31:53.467
Deal.

01:32:03.853 --> 01:32:05.354
Hey. What's going on?

01:32:05.438 --> 01:32:07.523
Security's here.
They're clearing everyone out.

01:32:07.607 --> 01:32:09.358
They're not waking him up.

01:32:09.442 --> 01:32:11.319
Whatever you do,
don't leave him alone.

01:32:11.402 --> 01:32:13.082
What do you mean
they're not waking him up?

01:32:14.296 --> 01:32:16.216
<i>The voting period has ended.</i>

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.826
<i>The clerks have
tabulated the results.</i>

01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:20.953
<i>The yeas are 63.</i>

01:32:21.037 --> 01:32:23.748
<i>The nays are 22.</i>

01:32:23.831 --> 01:32:26.334
<i>A majority of senators have
voted in the affirmative.</i>

01:32:26.417 --> 01:32:30.171
<i>The Dreyfus Act has been
repealed by Congress.</i>

01:32:35.676 --> 01:32:38.221
God, you guys are slow,
like a bunch of girls.

01:32:38.304 --> 01:32:39.388
This is Mattox.

01:32:39.472 --> 01:32:40.848
<i>Dennett's on board.</i>

01:32:40.932 --> 01:32:42.516
It's about time.

01:32:47.605 --> 01:32:48.731
Call it.

01:32:49.482 --> 01:32:50.900
<i>Get it done.</i>

01:32:51.901 --> 01:32:53.319
My pleasure.

01:33:02.036 --> 01:33:04.247
Mrs. Murphy... You can come
here as much as you want.

01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:07.583
You can threaten me. You can sue me.
You can take my home.

01:33:07.667 --> 01:33:10.586
But I am not gonna stop till I see
my husband. Do you understand that?

01:33:10.878 --> 01:33:13.631
Mr. Sellars would
very much like to see you.

01:33:15.174 --> 01:33:16.676
Is Alex okay?

01:33:16.926 --> 01:33:20.388
He has important information to share
with you. Will you accompany me?

01:33:22.723 --> 01:33:23.891
David.

01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:27.853
We gotta go.
Can you grab your coat?

01:33:29.188 --> 01:33:30.189
Hey!

01:33:30.273 --> 01:33:31.315
<i>I'm in the
elevator, on my way down.</i>

01:33:31.399 --> 01:33:32.942
I need access to the lab.

01:33:33.025 --> 01:33:34.652
That's insane.
They're still here.

01:33:34.735 --> 01:33:36.445
<i>Distract them.</i>

01:33:36.529 --> 01:33:37.655
Okay.

01:33:38.864 --> 01:33:39.907
I cannot...

01:33:39.991 --> 01:33:42.159
There's a
lady in here going hysterical.

01:33:42.243 --> 01:33:44.120
She will not let us in. She's
got the codes for the door.

01:33:44.203 --> 01:33:45.871
I repeat,
she will not let us in.

01:33:45.955 --> 01:33:48.249
Lady, you need to let us in there now.
We have to get in there.

01:33:48.332 --> 01:33:49.834
Are you not understanding
what I'm saying?

01:33:49.917 --> 01:33:52.757
Do you wanna be responsible for the
deaths of everyone in this building?

01:33:53.045 --> 01:33:54.422
Hey! Stop!

01:33:58.592 --> 01:33:59.719
Don't shoot!

01:33:59.802 --> 01:34:01.178
Step outside.

01:34:07.643 --> 01:34:09.312
Unlock the transmitter!

01:34:10.688 --> 01:34:11.689
Transmitter
unlocked!

01:34:19.155 --> 01:34:21.032
Send in Mrs. Murphy, please.

01:34:21.115 --> 01:34:22.835
<i>Right</i> away, sir.

01:34:24.744 --> 01:34:25.995
<i>Wake him up!</i>

01:34:26.412 --> 01:34:29.498
Alex! Alex!

01:34:29.915 --> 01:34:33.085
Alex, it's Dr. Norton,
you have to wake up!

01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:34.378
Alex, can you hear me?

01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:37.673
These men are here to kill us.

01:34:37.757 --> 01:34:40.217
They're here to kill us,
for chrissakes!

01:34:45.097 --> 01:34:46.807
<i>Mrs. Murphy, last night,</i>

01:34:46.891 --> 01:34:48.893
Alex had a psychotic break.

01:34:48.976 --> 01:34:53.272
He killed an unarmed colleague
and later suffered a seizure.

01:34:54.398 --> 01:34:55.900
We did everything,

01:34:55.983 --> 01:34:58.903
everything, we could, but the
doctors couldn't save him.

01:35:00.363 --> 01:35:02.406
Very sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

01:35:02.698 --> 01:35:05.242
We're going to be making
the announcement shortly.

01:35:05.701 --> 01:35:08.162
You shut me down. I was
about to get a confession.

01:35:08.788 --> 01:35:10.456
Mattox shut you down.

01:35:11.791 --> 01:35:14.668
I've removed your transmitter
so he won't do it again.

01:35:15.086 --> 01:35:17.254
Sellars can't afford
to wake you up.

01:35:18.297 --> 01:35:20.424
He sent these guys
to pull the plug.

01:35:20.883 --> 01:35:24.387
He wants you dead, Alex.
Do you understand?

01:35:24.553 --> 01:35:26.389
Sorry. If there's
anything we can do

01:35:26.472 --> 01:35:27.807
for you and David, we'll do it.

01:35:27.973 --> 01:35:30.101
I want nothing from you.

01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.353
I understand.

01:35:32.937 --> 01:35:35.231
You stay out of our lives.

01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:37.858
You and your company.

01:35:38.150 --> 01:35:40.027
If that's what
you think is best.

01:35:40.986 --> 01:35:42.446
There's one more thing.

01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:45.366
I think it would be to the benefit
of everyone, especially David

01:35:45.449 --> 01:35:47.660
if we kept this matter private.

01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:50.454
We don't wanna
damage Alex's legacy.

01:35:53.124 --> 01:35:54.959
<i>DR. NORTON'.
Alex! Alex!</i>

01:35:55.334 --> 01:35:56.961
I can fix this!

01:35:57.044 --> 01:35:58.504
You lied to me.

01:35:58.587 --> 01:35:59.839
You lied to my wife.

01:35:59.922 --> 01:36:01.549
You're working for the people
that are trying to kill me.

01:36:01.632 --> 01:36:02.912
You want me
to trust you, Doctor?

01:36:02.967 --> 01:36:05.010
Alex, I can go to the press!

01:36:06.429 --> 01:36:09.014
Alex, I can tell them
the whole story!

01:36:09.306 --> 01:36:10.766
Alex!

01:36:11.308 --> 01:36:13.227
Listen to me, please!

01:36:14.228 --> 01:36:17.523
Alex! Alex!

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.202
What the hell?

01:36:38.586 --> 01:36:39.986
Keep all our systems
at green light,

01:36:40.045 --> 01:36:42.131
and for chrissakes,
get Sellars on the phone.

01:36:42.214 --> 01:36:43.215
<i>Roger</i> that.

01:36:43.299 --> 01:36:45.259
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!

01:36:46.594 --> 01:36:48.179
Look at this city.

01:36:50.014 --> 01:36:51.557
So beautiful.

01:36:52.558 --> 01:36:55.227
It's become so peaceful.

01:36:58.022 --> 01:36:59.356
I Wish

01:37:00.357 --> 01:37:02.610
I had some good news
for Detroit.

01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:04.862
I have very sad news.

01:37:05.029 --> 01:37:07.698
Despite our best efforts
to save him,

01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:10.451
Alex Murphy passed away
just hours ago.

01:37:10.868 --> 01:37:12.161
Alex Murphy was...

01:37:12.244 --> 01:37:13.524
Mr. Sellars.

01:37:13.871 --> 01:37:15.456
What is it?
Mattox just called.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.875
We need you to come with us now.

01:37:23.627 --> 01:37:26.067
Ma'am, I need you to turn around
and go the other way, please.

01:37:26.091 --> 01:37:28.093
What are you talking about? We
have a security situation here.

01:37:28.177 --> 01:37:29.595
I need you to turn around
and go the other way.

01:37:29.678 --> 01:37:31.558
Sir, there's a car outside
that's supposed to...

01:37:31.639 --> 01:37:33.265
That area is locked down.
Now go.

01:37:33.349 --> 01:37:35.017
What's h -
I said go! appemng?

01:37:35.351 --> 01:37:37.353
I wanna talk to Mr. Sellars.

01:37:40.272 --> 01:37:41.357
Mr. Sellars.

01:37:41.524 --> 01:37:43.564
How close is that helicopter?
About 10 minutes, sir.

01:38:01.335 --> 01:38:02.586
Excuse me.
Yes?

01:38:02.753 --> 01:38:05.089
I need to speak with
Sergeant Jack Lewis.

01:38:05.256 --> 01:38:06.465
It's an emergency.

01:38:06.632 --> 01:38:08.259
Stand by. Mr. Sellars.

01:38:08.717 --> 01:38:10.558
Apparently there's a Clara
Murphy in the lobby.

01:38:10.594 --> 01:38:13.931
Raymond, if she sees him,
we are dead in the water.

01:38:14.098 --> 01:38:16.433
What do you wanna do?
Bring Mrs. Murphy up here.

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:17.800
Yes, sir.

01:38:21.605 --> 01:38:24.400
Norton said they may be
using drones for protection.

01:38:24.567 --> 01:38:26.610
So whatever you do,
do not draw your weapons.

01:38:26.777 --> 01:38:29.405
They won't shoot
if we're unarmed. Clear?

01:38:29.488 --> 01:38:30.489
Clear.
Clear.

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.481
Hold it right there.

01:38:49.258 --> 01:38:50.259
Don't move.

01:38:54.013 --> 01:38:57.349
This is private property. You
are not authorized to be here!

01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:03.606
I'd put those guns down now
if I were you.

01:39:03.772 --> 01:39:05.441
Stand down.
All right, man, we're good.

01:39:51.904 --> 01:39:53.238
Head to the lower level.

01:39:54.487 --> 01:39:55.967
Hold up, hold up!

01:39:55.991 --> 01:39:57.201
Ram it!

01:40:57.469 --> 01:40:58.762
Gun it.

01:41:00.222 --> 01:41:01.807
GO, go, go! Now!

01:41:17.781 --> 01:41:19.283
Alex, run!

01:41:20.117 --> 01:41:22.161
Omnicorp Security!
Drop your weapons!

01:41:22.327 --> 01:41:24.246
Drop your weapon.

01:41:24.413 --> 01:41:27.207
<i>Keep your hands above your head
and no one will be harmed.</i>

01:41:42.473 --> 01:41:43.599
What's going on?

01:41:43.682 --> 01:41:45.934
Mrs. Murphy, I want you to
listen to me carefully.

01:41:46.101 --> 01:41:48.604
The organic part of
your husband Alex is dead.

01:41:48.687 --> 01:41:50.814
The robotic part of him
is malfunctioning,

01:41:50.898 --> 01:41:51.982
and he's shooting up
the building.

01:41:52.065 --> 01:41:54.860
So we've gotta get you and your
son out of here right away.

01:41:55.027 --> 01:41:56.570
I gotta take this call.

01:41:57.666 --> 01:41:59.507
He just left the lobby
and he's headed our way.

01:41:59.531 --> 01:42:01.074
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

01:42:01.492 --> 01:42:04.536
Don't shoot. My robot. You just flank.
Got it.

01:42:04.703 --> 01:42:05.954
Tin Man.

01:42:08.707 --> 01:42:09.917
Tin Man.

01:42:10.959 --> 01:42:12.211
Tin Man.

01:42:12.795 --> 01:42:13.962
Oh, there it is.

01:42:14.630 --> 01:42:16.006
You look like crap.

01:42:18.634 --> 01:42:19.802
What's the matter?

01:42:19.968 --> 01:42:21.178
Can't shoot?

01:42:22.971 --> 01:42:24.056
Huh?

01:42:24.807 --> 01:42:26.892
What were you thinking?
This isn't a drill.

01:42:26.975 --> 01:42:27.976
You're a robot.

01:42:28.185 --> 01:42:30.395
I'm a red asset.
Wrote that myself.

01:42:30.854 --> 01:42:32.147
What do you think?

01:42:32.564 --> 01:42:35.400
Come on, Tin Man,
just pull the trigger.

01:42:35.567 --> 01:42:36.568
Pull it.

01:42:37.361 --> 01:42:38.445
You can run.

01:42:38.987 --> 01:42:39.988
Go on.

01:42:40.239 --> 01:42:41.365
Run.

01:42:41.824 --> 01:42:42.950
Run!

01:42:43.283 --> 01:42:45.118
There you go. Run.

01:42:45.577 --> 01:42:46.912
Run.Run!

01:42:50.082 --> 01:42:51.500
Whoo!

01:42:51.583 --> 01:42:53.710
Stings like a bitch, don't it?

01:42:53.877 --> 01:42:57.172
Aren't you lucky I didn't
have my gun set to "kill"?

01:42:58.423 --> 01:42:59.758
Hey, listen.

01:43:00.217 --> 01:43:01.802
This isn't personal.

01:43:02.845 --> 01:43:04.596
Well, maybe a little.

01:43:06.348 --> 01:43:08.183
I'm gonna put you
out of your misery.

01:43:19.621 --> 01:43:21.422
<i>Helicopter's approaching.</i>

01:43:21.446 --> 01:43:22.698
Mr. Sellars boards first.

01:43:22.781 --> 01:43:25.742
No, no, no. Mrs. Murphy, you
and your son can get on first.

01:43:31.164 --> 01:43:32.457
Officer down.

01:43:32.541 --> 01:43:33.667
Mechanical room.

01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:35.335
Omnicorp Building.

01:43:35.502 --> 01:43:37.382
<i>Roger that. EMS on the way.</i>

01:43:39.006 --> 01:43:40.591
You're gonna be okay, Jack.

01:43:40.674 --> 01:43:41.925
It's nonfatal.

01:43:42.009 --> 01:43:43.594
Go. Go.

01:43:44.803 --> 01:43:47.598
Omni-LZ Helo-1
on approach to deck.

01:43:54.354 --> 01:43:55.355
What's that?

01:43:57.274 --> 01:43:58.400
He's got a gun!
What?

01:43:58.567 --> 01:43:59.568
Pull up! Pull up!

01:44:04.531 --> 01:44:06.825
What the hell is he doing?
Sorry, sir. I don't know.

01:44:12.372 --> 01:44:13.373
Alex?

01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:14.541
Dad?

01:44:17.961 --> 01:44:19.379
Clara, David.

01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:21.548
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:44:21.632 --> 01:44:22.633
Wait.

01:44:23.717 --> 01:44:25.594
Get out of the way.
Alex, put down the gun.

01:44:25.761 --> 01:44:27.846
Clara, take David
and get out of the way now!

01:44:29.723 --> 01:44:31.123
Raymond Sellars,
you're under arrest

01:44:31.183 --> 01:44:32.943
for the attempted murder
of a police officer.

01:44:36.647 --> 01:44:39.149
Are you here to cuff me?
All right.

01:44:39.942 --> 01:44:41.401
Go 'head, cuff me.

01:44:42.611 --> 01:44:45.197
You can't. You're not
programmed that way.

01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.782
If you go against the program,

01:44:46.865 --> 01:44:48.700
the entire system
shuts down, so.

01:44:48.867 --> 01:44:50.953
You don't even have a warrant.
We'll overlook this little...

01:44:51.119 --> 01:44:53.205
Get down on the ground and put
your hands behind your back.

01:44:53.372 --> 01:44:54.373
I'm just from marketing.

01:44:54.539 --> 01:44:56.875
Now! Ok a)', yep, yep, yep Yep

01:44:57.042 --> 01:44:59.211
Alex, we need to
work together here.

01:44:59.378 --> 01:45:02.464
Because I'm the only one with the
technology to keep you alive.

01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:05.217
Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.

01:45:11.348 --> 01:45:12.349
All right.

01:45:12.516 --> 01:45:13.517
Weapon.

01:45:15.185 --> 01:45:18.313
Alex, honestly,
I mean you no harm.

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.774
If I wanted to, I could have
killed you a long time ago.

01:45:20.877 --> 01:45:22.877
I just aim this right at
your head and blow it off.

01:45:22.901 --> 01:45:24.736
Sellars, please! Don't!

01:45:24.903 --> 01:45:27.544
I mean, if I wanted to, I could
just aim this at your little family

01:45:28.782 --> 01:45:30.367
and I could just kill them too.

01:45:30.492 --> 01:45:32.160
And really, there's nothing
you could do about it

01:45:32.244 --> 01:45:34.246
because, let's face it,

01:45:34.871 --> 01:45:36.206
you're a robot.

01:45:36.832 --> 01:45:38.291
Do you understand that?

01:45:42.546 --> 01:45:43.547
Alex.

01:45:46.717 --> 01:45:47.968
Dad!

01:45:52.097 --> 01:45:53.348
Baby.

01:45:58.937 --> 01:46:00.022
Hey.

01:46:01.648 --> 01:46:02.649
Hey.

01:46:03.150 --> 01:46:05.152
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:46:06.111 --> 01:46:08.363
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:46:58.246 --> 01:46:59.998
How you feeling, Alex?

01:47:01.917 --> 01:47:03.043
I'm ready.

01:47:40.831 --> 01:47:42.207
He's ready.

01:48:16.324 --> 01:48:17.492
There's still no word

01:48:17.576 --> 01:48:20.579
from Omnicorp
parent company, OCP.

01:48:21.496 --> 01:48:25.250
And although the government says
they are rebuilding Alex Murphy,

01:48:25.333 --> 01:48:28.044
rumors continue to swirl
about his condition.

01:48:28.128 --> 01:48:32.674
But we have obtained exclusive
video taken by cell phone

01:48:32.757 --> 01:48:35.177
that shows the people of Detroit

01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:37.345
may have Alex Murphy
back on the streets

01:48:37.429 --> 01:48:39.014
sooner than they think.

01:48:41.057 --> 01:48:42.559
The real tragedy here

01:48:42.642 --> 01:48:47.439
is that our president chose
to uphold the Dreyfus Act.

01:48:48.815 --> 01:48:53.570
Now, I have no doubt he was
manipulated by our biased media

01:48:53.653 --> 01:48:57.115
and by whistle-blower
Dennett Norton.

01:48:57.199 --> 01:49:00.952
<i>I acknowledge we know
less than we thought.</i>

01:49:01.953 --> 01:49:04.873
<i>But I do believe
my research program is sound.</i>

01:49:06.458 --> 01:49:07.709
<i>What I did With it</i>

01:49:09.211 --> 01:49:10.253
<i>was wrong.</i>

01:49:10.337 --> 01:49:13.340
The fact that this
mother...

01:49:13.423 --> 01:49:16.676
is not serving time
in some federal penitentiary

01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:20.764
is a huge, hot, heaping
pile of horse...

01:49:26.519 --> 01:49:30.899
Now I know some of you may think that
this kind of thinking is dangerous

01:49:30.982 --> 01:49:34.986
and these machines
violate your civil liberties.

01:49:35.153 --> 01:49:39.282
Some of you even believe that the
use of these drones overseas

01:49:39.366 --> 01:49:44.037
makes us the same kind of
bullying imperialists

01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:46.873
that our forefathers
were trying to escape.

01:49:47.332 --> 01:49:49.793
To you, I say...

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:52.337
Stop whining!

01:49:54.172 --> 01:49:56.800
America is now

01:49:56.883 --> 01:49:59.177
and always will be

01:49:59.261 --> 01:50:03.682
the greatest country
on the face of the Earth!

01:50:08.228 --> 01:50:09.771
I'm Pat Novak.

01:50:11.273 --> 01:50:12.524
Good night.

01:50:19.489 --> 01:50:22.659
<i>Breakin' rocks in the hot sun</i>

01:50:22.742 --> 01:50:25.745
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

01:50:26.162 --> 01:50:28.957
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:32.252
<i>I needed the money
'cause I had none</i>

01:50:32.335 --> 01:50:35.297
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:38.466
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:41.678
<i>I left my baby
and it feels so bad</i>

01:50:41.761 --> 01:50:44.389
<i>I guess my race is run</i>

01:50:45.015 --> 01:50:48.018
<i>She's the best girl
that I ever had</i>

01:50:48.101 --> 01:50:51.229
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

01:50:51.313 --> 01:50:53.982
<i>I fought the law and the</i>

01:50:54.482 --> 01:50:57.652
<i>Robbin' people with a six gun</i>

01:50:57.736 --> 01:51:00.780
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

01:51:00.864 --> 01:51:03.992
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

01:51:04.075 --> 01:51:07.162
<i>I lost my girl and I lost my fun</i>

01:51:07.245 --> 01:51:10.498
<i>I fought the law and the law won</i>

01:51:10.582 --> 01:51:13.418
