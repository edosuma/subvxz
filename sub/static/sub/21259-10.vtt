[imitates Candace's voice]
Hello, this is

00:05.339 --> 00:06.240
Candace von Weber.

00:06.274 --> 00:09.110
I'd like to make a reservation
for jury duty.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.544
Voiceover: This season on
Odd Mom Out.

00:10.578 --> 00:13.047
- What are the odds of
getting sequestered?

00:13.081 --> 00:14.248
- You have no idea what
I've been through.

00:14.282 --> 00:17.185
- I am the founder
and She-E-O

00:17.218 --> 00:20.388
of one of the fastest growing
retail brands in the country.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.123
- It's not like you're
Louis Vuitton getting

00:22.156 --> 00:24.358
knocked off and sold on
every street corner.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.493
- What, did you make
like a dentist

00:25.526 --> 00:28.129
and gun down Mufasa?

00:28.162 --> 00:30.331
- What happens on
safari, stays on safari.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.266
- I am capable of a lot more
than you think.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.102
It's time you started to
recognize that.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.637
- Devon, consider yourself
relieved of all duties.

00:36.670 --> 00:37.805
- Brooke.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.508
- I saw one of your bags on
the street today in pink.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.510
- Oh we don't do pastels.
It's a knock off.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.145
- Are you talking about
an IPO?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.114
- Oh, the first rule of
going public is

00:46.147 --> 00:47.648
you don't talk about it
in public.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.650
- That weekend dadisaur is
about to go extinct.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.552
- You should go rescue him.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.386
- Crap!

00:52.420 --> 00:54.155
I don't date dads.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.157
- Tucker is my grandson.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.525
- Mom, all the girls shave.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.592
- Take your time.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.294
Don't just go with the flow.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.563
Wait, you didn't get your
period, did you?

01:02.596 --> 01:03.464
- No.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.433
But Remy and Molly have.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.601
- What?!

01:07.635 --> 01:10.238
- So what exactly is happening
at the temple tomorrow night?

01:10.271 --> 01:12.306
- Okay, so basically
they call the kids up

01:12.340 --> 01:14.308
and then give them
their B'nei Mitzvah dates.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.544
And then the parents
scramble to book

01:16.577 --> 01:18.412
the nicest party venues
and the kids

01:18.446 --> 01:20.281
race to look up
their Torah portion.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.449
- Aren't they all
the same?

01:21.482 --> 01:23.651
- That's like saying all
Spielberg

01:23.684 --> 01:24.885
movies are the same.

01:24.918 --> 01:25.986
- Okay, um,
what was yours?

01:26.019 --> 01:29.690
- Instructions on how to
clean a post-coital penis.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.426
- Why is that even
an option?

01:32.460 --> 01:35.329
- Imagine a 13-year-old me
chanting that.

01:35.363 --> 01:35.963
- What are you guys
talking about?

01:35.996 --> 01:37.165
- Nothing!
- Nothing.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.332
- What's up, sweetie?

01:38.366 --> 01:39.467
- I was wondering
if you wanted to

01:39.500 --> 01:40.668
shoot some hoops
this weekend.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.203
- I would love it!

01:42.236 --> 01:45.139
- Cool. Love you guys.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.308
- Our little girl is
maturing so nicely.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.476
- [screaming] Mom!

01:48.509 --> 01:49.743
Dottie's wearing my
Butter sweatshirt!

01:49.777 --> 01:51.345
Tell that hairy butthole
to take it off

01:51.379 --> 01:54.114
or I'm electrocuting
her favorite doll!

01:56.384 --> 01:57.485
- Psycho.

01:57.518 --> 02:01.589
[theme music]
* Hey yes you know

02:01.622 --> 02:05.493
* I'm feeling fine
I'm feeling fine *

02:05.526 --> 02:07.395
- Hazel's mood swings are
more extreme

02:07.428 --> 02:09.197
than that
pirate ship ride.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.498
She goes from
Lil Orphan Annie

02:10.531 --> 02:12.466
to Linda Blair
in 15 seconds.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.368
- Yet you question my
decision not to

02:14.402 --> 02:15.469
become a parent.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.671
- Looks like you might go
straight to grandparent.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.940
How's it going
with hot Pawpaw?

02:19.973 --> 02:23.311
- He's fun, confident and
a champ in the sack.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.545
- You're not worried he's
gonna break his hip

02:24.578 --> 02:25.779
while you're shtupping?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.381
- Jill! He's not that old.

02:27.415 --> 02:28.582
I don't think.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.483
- Are you gonna
bring him tonight

02:29.517 --> 02:31.519
to celebrate Hazel's
bat mitzvah date?

02:31.552 --> 02:33.954
Or is 6:30 too late
for him to eat?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.390
- Eating early is better
for the digestion.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.326
Can I have your potatoes if
you're not going to?

02:38.359 --> 02:40.228
- Go to town, I'm too
nervous to eat.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.431
This is the most me thing
I've worked on in so long.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.367
And if it gets rejected,
it will suck balls.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.468
- Okay tell me
what it is!

02:47.501 --> 02:49.437
I tell you everything,
even work stuff

02:49.470 --> 02:51.539
I'm legally and ethically
barred from sharing.

02:51.572 --> 02:55.676
- Remember those Peeps
dioramas I used to make?

02:55.709 --> 02:58.279
- Oh my God I loved those.

02:58.312 --> 03:02.283
My favorite was the S&M one
after our jaunt to The Vault.

03:02.316 --> 03:05.286
With that one Peep
fetishizing another's foot.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.387
- Even though they
don't have feet?

03:06.420 --> 03:08.289
- That's what made it
so brilliant!

03:08.322 --> 03:11.191
When did you start
making those again?

03:12.626 --> 03:14.362
Ah! Peep Navarro.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.430
You can even tell how
hung over I am.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.499
- I'm pitching Rawling House
a coffee table book

03:18.532 --> 03:20.301
of my Peep tableaux
to satirize

03:20.334 --> 03:22.303
the crazy shit in my life.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.572
- Amazing! Channel Ollie
in your pitch

03:24.605 --> 03:26.607
and you'll definitely
sell it.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.777
Hmm, Brazilian.
Bold move, Peep.

03:31.845 --> 03:32.813
- I depict situations

03:32.846 --> 03:35.015
that have come to
be thought of as "normal."

03:35.048 --> 03:37.518
But by holding up a fun house
mirror to them,

03:37.551 --> 03:39.720
I'm able to expose
them for how truly

03:39.753 --> 03:41.422
ridiculous they are.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.590
- Why Peeps?

03:42.623 --> 03:44.525
- Sugar has a long tradition
of being used

03:44.558 --> 03:46.026
as an artistic medium.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.595
- Does it?

03:47.628 --> 03:48.496
- No, really.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.031
In 1600, Maria de
Medici was supposed to

03:51.064 --> 03:54.268
marry Henri IV, but he was
off fighting a war.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.270
So they commissioned
local sculptors

03:56.304 --> 03:58.038
to create a sugar statue
of the King

03:58.071 --> 03:59.873
to stand in his
place at the altar.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.042
- While I'm impressed you
memorized

04:02.075 --> 04:03.744
that delightful anecdote,

04:03.777 --> 04:07.348
I'm struggling to see how
it relates to your work.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.617
- Well back then sugar was
a luxury item.

04:09.650 --> 04:13.554
So Its use in art was a
flagrant display of wealth.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.857
By using Peeps I'm
employing a symbol

04:16.890 --> 04:18.592
of the everyman to comment

04:18.626 --> 04:21.329
on the lifestyle
of today's rich.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.365
- I'll be in touch.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.367
- Uh, do you want me to
keep my portfolio since

04:26.400 --> 04:28.068
Rupert wasn't able
to attend?

04:28.101 --> 04:33.507
- I'm sure one image will
give him a complete picture.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.376
- Okay, thanks.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.780
Honestly I feel really great
about the work

04:39.813 --> 04:41.649
and the way that
I pitched it.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.517
Eff that naysaying
gatekeeper

04:43.551 --> 04:44.785
if she doesn't get it.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.087
I'm on such a high.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.322
- That's great, honey.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.390
- What are you eating?

04:49.423 --> 04:50.391
- Leftover Thai.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.626
I couldn't stop thinking
about the Pad See Ew.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.727
- You're home right now?

04:53.761 --> 04:54.562
Don't go anywhere.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.398
- Who buys books anymore?
That's my con-

04:57.431 --> 04:58.799
- Devon! Hi.

04:58.832 --> 05:02.536
- [stutters] Jill, hi, what-
what are you doing here?

05:02.570 --> 05:06.340
- Um, realizing or crushing
my dreams, not sure yet.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.675
Do you work here now?

05:07.708 --> 05:11.345
- Not exactly.
- Okay, well good to see you.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.813
- Yeah, you too!

05:16.584 --> 05:18.419
- Brooke!
- Brooke!

05:18.452 --> 05:19.620
- Dan, Doyle.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.590
So, how are we pacing?

05:22.623 --> 05:23.924
- This has honestly been
the least stressful

05:23.957 --> 05:25.493
quiet period we've had.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.927
- The SEC said your books
were cleaner-

05:26.960 --> 05:28.462
- Than a street corner
in Singapore.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.697
- Are you ready to pick
your stock ticker?

05:29.730 --> 05:30.798
- Are you kidding?

05:30.831 --> 05:31.965
This is the happy place
I go to

05:31.999 --> 05:34.735
when I'm forced
to be with the children.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.704
I want V-O-N.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.739
- Taken. Velocity Omega
National.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.841
- B-VON?
- Bank of Vanuatu.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.844
- VON-W?
- Venezuelan Oil Now.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.713
- Well what do
you suggest?

05:45.746 --> 05:46.947
- W-E-B-R.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.618
- I was really hoping to
get the Von in there.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.386
- How about V-O-N-Z?

05:52.420 --> 05:53.854
- It's like the Fonz
but with a V.

05:53.887 --> 05:57.391
- VONZ.
Yeah, I like it.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.992
Let's do this!

05:59.026 --> 06:00.528
- Don't make waves for
five more days

06:00.561 --> 06:01.662
and the next time
we see you--

06:01.695 --> 06:02.863
- You'll be ringing the
opening bell

06:02.896 --> 06:05.499
of the New York
Stock Exchange.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.868
[all] To VONZ!

06:11.505 --> 06:12.873
- Nooners are
so underrated.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.743
No one's tired and it's
supposed to end quickly.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.479
- Yeah, this feels good.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.814
Lex has come
to his senses,

06:20.848 --> 06:22.750
the kids are mostly okay,

06:22.783 --> 06:25.753
you and I are
back on track.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.922
- Watch, now something
terrible is going happen.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.491
- Why do you
always do that?

06:30.524 --> 06:33.427
- What? Poop
on your rainbow?

06:33.461 --> 06:36.029
- Why is it so hard for you
when things are going well?

06:36.063 --> 06:38.866
- History has shown that
the Jews are always

06:38.899 --> 06:41.201
two rugelach away
from persecution.

06:41.234 --> 06:45.038
- Regardless, thank you

06:45.072 --> 06:48.008
for the very
unexpected encounter.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.176
- Oh! That reminds me.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.579
I forgot to text Brooke I
ran into her old assistant,

06:51.612 --> 06:53.914
Devon, at the publisher's.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.015
Oh shit!

06:55.048 --> 06:56.617
Six missed calls from
Hazel's school.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.587
Did they call you?

06:59.620 --> 07:00.521
- No.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.321
- I turned off my ringer
for the meeting

07:01.354 --> 07:02.856
and I forgot to turn
it back on.

07:02.890 --> 07:03.857
- Relax honey.
They probably just

07:03.891 --> 07:05.859
want you to stuff
envelopes for the benefit.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.795
- Hi, this is Jill Weber,
Hazel's mom.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.763
Do you need me
to come get her?

07:10.831 --> 07:12.933
She did? No, no,
my mother's in Palm Springs.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.536
My mother-in-law.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.638
Well, why didn't you call
my husband?

07:18.539 --> 07:20.841
Oh I see, okay.
Thank you.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.044
- Is she okay?

07:24.077 --> 07:26.547
- Hazel just got
her period.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.916
[lively music]

07:29.883 --> 07:36.189
- Hazel, honey.
How are you feeling?

07:36.223 --> 07:38.626
I am so sorry
that I wasn't there.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.193
- It's no big deal, Mom.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.963
Nemo didn't have a mother
and he did just fine.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.064
- We bought her
a new ensemble

07:44.097 --> 07:45.833
and went for bellinis.

07:45.866 --> 07:46.967
- Thank you for being
there, Mother.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.068
We'll see you
at the party?

07:48.101 --> 07:51.004
- Yes. And, Jill, I know
I've made what's perceived

07:51.038 --> 07:52.540
to be mistakes
in the past

07:52.573 --> 07:55.208
by not asking permission,
so might I add

07:55.242 --> 07:57.945
a few adornments
to tonight's dinner?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.279
- Well-

07:59.312 --> 08:01.615
- I was recently
sequestered for 41 days.

08:01.649 --> 08:04.217
That's one day longer than
Jesus lasted, Jill.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.286
Humor me?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.088
That would be lovely,
Candace,

08:08.121 --> 08:10.958
and thank you
for asking.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.060
- I'm going to make it
extra festive

08:13.093 --> 08:14.962
for our little woman here.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.965
- Thank you, Candace.
Love you.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.969
- See you tonight!

08:22.002 --> 08:23.170
- Come on, sweetheart.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.940
[phone rings]

08:26.974 --> 08:28.108
- Brooke von Weber.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.543
- Yeah, I'm a producer from
the Wendy Williams Show?

08:29.577 --> 08:30.678
Is it true
your company-

08:30.711 --> 08:34.147
- Sorry, but I'm not at
liberty to say at this time.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.282
- Ma'am, I'm
trying to give you

08:35.315 --> 08:36.917
an opportunity to
tell your side-

08:36.950 --> 08:38.886
- Sir, I appreciate your
interest in Von Weber,

08:38.919 --> 08:41.622
but my official comment is,
"no comment."

08:41.655 --> 08:45.092
Ugh, the press is
clamoring for my story.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.528
I can't wait until I can
officially give them one.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.301
- Scaly, pustulant skin
lesions

08:54.334 --> 08:56.269
isn't the worst
Torah portion.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.337
- Can we not.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.906
- It could have
been sodomy.

08:58.939 --> 08:59.640
- Jill!

08:59.673 --> 09:01.274
- What is wrong
with you?!

09:01.308 --> 09:03.276
- FML.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.747
- Why don't you go pick up
the twins and go home.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.148
I'll deal with
Maleficent.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.650
- Good luck.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.658
- I got mine when
I was thirteen.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.126
- [groans]

09:19.159 --> 09:20.260
- Pop pop and I
were going out

09:20.293 --> 09:22.029
for a daddy
daughter date.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.933
I got all decked out in my
Naf naf skirt and neon socks

09:25.966 --> 09:27.668
and as many black
rubber bracelets

09:27.701 --> 09:29.637
I could get my hands on.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.304
We went for Peking Duck

09:31.338 --> 09:33.173
and then he took me to
Forbidden Broadway.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.076
And then halfway through the
Fiddler on the Roof spoof,

09:36.109 --> 09:39.379
I felt Niagara Falls
in my undies.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.049
During intermission
I went to the bathroom.

09:42.082 --> 09:47.788
And my Calvins looked like
Butcher Lazar Wolf's apron.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.757
I knew what it was but
I didn't know what to do!

09:49.790 --> 09:51.124
So I put a quarter
in the machine

09:51.158 --> 09:53.994
and I got a pad
the size of California.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.363
And we went back
for Act 2.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.698
And then afterwards,
we were walking

09:57.731 --> 09:59.332
down the street on
a theater high

09:59.366 --> 10:02.670
and all of the sudden,
my pad falls out

10:02.703 --> 10:05.338
sunny side up
on 60th and Third.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.075
I didn't know you had to
remove the adhesive strip

10:08.108 --> 10:11.078
thingy before sticking it
in your underwear.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.013
- That's the worst
story I've ever heard.

10:13.046 --> 10:17.117
- See? Getting your period
during Russian Literature

10:17.150 --> 10:19.419
at an all girl's school
is no biggie.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.354
- It was a lot more
traumatic than that, Mom.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.623
You'd know that if you'd
actually been there.

get on top.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.106

10:44.745 --> 10:46.780
- Wh- what are you doing?
- Nothing.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.049
- Wait- is there
a problem?

10:49.082 --> 10:51.318
- You were just exhibiting
signs of hypertension.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.153
Overexertion for
someone your age-

10:53.186 --> 10:55.055
- My age? I work out
everyday

10:55.088 --> 10:57.324
and I eat way
healthier than you.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.827
- Men over 55 are at greater
risk for heart disease than-

10:59.860 --> 11:01.361
- There's some lube
in the night table

11:01.394 --> 11:03.330
if you want to check
my prostate.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.332
Otherwise let's leave the
doctor bag at the door.

me?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.394

11:34.427 --> 11:38.766
- Now I'll call you old
and an asshole.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.768
- Oh.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.804
- I totally ruined
my uniform.

11:43.837 --> 11:49.142
- That's why God made
Clorox 2 Stain Remover, Hazel.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.779
- Ugh, it's all so gross.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.516
it is completely natural.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.185
- So is animals eating
their young.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.220
- Good point.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.855
Jesus, there are
so many options!

12:01.889 --> 12:03.423
I thought it was
just pads n' pons.

But now there's

18:52.832 --> 18:55.635
- me about it so.
- Okay, hold up.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.837
- You just said,
"Brooke Weber".

18:57.870 --> 19:00.273
Where's the "von"?

19:00.307 --> 19:02.642
- Well, Brooke will say
it was

19:02.675 --> 19:04.277
[all] restored

19:04.311 --> 19:06.346
- but gimme a 65 dollar
cashier's check

19:06.379 --> 19:07.747
and an hour
in Civil Court

19:07.780 --> 19:09.649
and I can make you
Wendy von Williams.

19:09.682 --> 19:10.850
[audience laughs]

19:10.883 --> 19:15.755
What?!
Wendy von Williams?

19:15.788 --> 19:18.191
Yes, what do you think?

19:18.225 --> 19:20.827
- You ungrateful weasel.

19:20.860 --> 19:21.661
- Yas!

19:21.694 --> 19:22.762
- I will destroy him.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.797
- If he doesn't destroy
you first.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.367
- You have that friend who's in
a horrible relationship

19:27.400 --> 19:29.936
and bitches about it,
but doesn't ever leave?

19:29.969 --> 19:31.938
- Russ, yes.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.940
- [sobbing]
That was me.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.776
You know, Brooke
doesn't like anyone

19:36.809 --> 19:39.346
and when she laughs
at your joke

19:39.379 --> 19:41.281
or lets you in on a secret,
it makes you feel special.

19:41.314 --> 19:45.352
- Did she let you in
on any big secrets?

19:45.385 --> 19:48.655
- Enough to fill a
327-page book.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.291
- Spill it.

19:51.324 --> 19:54.627
- Well, someone told
Brooke her company

19:54.661 --> 19:56.896
wasn't truly successful
because she wasn't

19:56.929 --> 19:58.731
getting knocked off.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.400
So Brooke asked me
to research

20:00.433 --> 20:02.802
where bags could be
made on the cheap.

20:02.835 --> 20:06.806
- Hold on. Are
you insinuating

20:06.839 --> 20:11.678
Brooke Weber is manufacturing
her own knockoffs?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.414
- Well, you'll have to
read the book,

20:14.447 --> 20:17.350
but don't be
surprised if there's

20:17.384 --> 20:18.184
a sweatshop in Mexico
with 6-year-olds

20:18.217 --> 20:21.854
sewing VW emblems
onto saddlebags.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.391
- That is so not right.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.293
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg!

20:26.326 --> 20:29.329
When we get back, the
story behind this picture

20:29.362 --> 20:33.466
of the mother-in-law on a
recent safari in Asia.

20:33.500 --> 20:36.903
And the deets on her husband,
the astro-

20:36.936 --> 20:40.840
[both] Not!

20:40.873 --> 20:43.943
- Grab a snack
and come on back.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.645
[cell phones ring]

20:45.678 --> 20:46.646
[text message pings]

20:46.679 --> 20:48.781
- Is this all true?

20:48.815 --> 20:50.450
- Okay, I'll draft a cease
and desist letter for Devon,

20:50.483 --> 20:52.919
then we'll sue the pants off
of Rawling House for libel.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.722
- I'm calling the
liquor store.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.324
- Rawling House
bought my book!

20:57.357 --> 21:04.063
Let's get this
period party started!

21:04.096 --> 21:07.033
What?

21:07.066 --> 21:10.770
- There's no hiding,
Jill. The secret's out.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.439
- Candace,
I am so sorry.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.774
I had no idea that you
would be picked

21:14.807 --> 21:16.743
let alone sequestered!

21:16.776 --> 21:19.779
- I-
- Jill.

21:20.547 --> 21:23.750
- What secret were you guys
talking about?

21:23.783 --> 21:24.250
- For more Odd Mom Out,
