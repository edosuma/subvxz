WEBVTT

00:21.187 --> 00:23.314
How could so much
come out of one little Podling?

00:25.775 --> 00:26.860
Aw...

00:27.360 --> 00:28.319
Feeling better, Hup?

00:29.487 --> 00:32.449
Hup... want... die.dream

00:32.824 --> 00:33.992
Aw.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.205
-It's air sickness.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.042
Don't worry, my little friend.
It will pass.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.837
The Circle of the Suns
sits atop that mountain.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.215
You'll have to travel
the rest of the way by foot.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.926
We cannot thank you enough.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.512
I beg you to reconsider my offer,
Princess.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.806
Come away to the Wellspring.

00:57.223 --> 01:00.101
The Dousan know death
like the Spriton know the soil.

01:00.518 --> 01:03.313
And death hangs heavily over
the Circle of the Suns

01:03.855 --> 01:05.774
-and over your quest.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.152
-I'm quite capable of handling myself. Hm.
-Yes.

01:09.694 --> 01:13.656
The most beautiful desert flowers
are always the most dangerous.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.493
-Oh!

01:17.535 --> 01:19.788
-Until we meet again.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.083
Until we meet again.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.716
Follow the stone path to the Circle.
Be swift.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.968
A powerful storm approaches,

01:34.302 --> 01:37.055
and you don't want to be caught
in the open when it strikes.

01:37.722 --> 01:38.723
Safe travels.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.614
-I guess we walk. Hm?
-Hm.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.148
The Circle of the Suns.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.526
But how do we get up there?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.070
We'll think of something.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.117
Hm?

02:40.660 --> 02:42.829
- Sandstorm?

02:45.915 --> 02:48.918
All right! We need to work together.
We need to find a way to get--

02:50.545 --> 02:51.921
-Lore!

02:52.005 --> 02:53.214
-Lore, wait! Stop!
- Wait!

02:53.506 --> 02:56.176
Stop right now! We have to help them too!

02:57.969 --> 02:59.637
That's what friends do!

03:02.223 --> 03:03.224
It's coming!

03:23.912 --> 03:25.330
Go, go, go, go, go!

03:26.206 --> 03:27.415
Climb, Lore!

03:31.377 --> 03:32.253
Hold on!

03:35.381 --> 03:36.216
Hup!

03:39.302 --> 03:40.303
Don't let go!

03:51.231 --> 03:52.357
We're almost there!

04:03.952 --> 04:05.203
Well, that was exciting.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.206
Yeah, was too exciting!

04:09.707 --> 04:10.917
You saved us, Lore.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.587
Thank you, friend.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.717
Not much of a talker,

04:20.468 --> 04:21.302
is he?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.470
Mm-mm.

04:23.721 --> 04:24.847
Hello?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.349
Is anyone home?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.393
Hello!

04:28.977 --> 04:30.561
I got your message.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.729
What's that I hear?

04:32.146 --> 04:34.315
Could it be? Sounds like...

04:35.566 --> 04:37.777
It is! It is!

04:37.860 --> 04:40.113
It's Gelfling!

04:46.869 --> 04:49.372
-Uh!
-Welcome!

04:51.249 --> 04:52.083
Huh?

04:53.251 --> 04:56.754
Oh, it's wonderful to see you!
Do you see my wonder?

04:56.838 --> 04:58.756
Look upon my wonder!

04:59.465 --> 05:00.800
- Uh...
-Huh?

05:01.342 --> 05:03.261
Uh...

05:03.594 --> 05:05.054
We're looking...

05:05.388 --> 05:07.473
It's... a lot.

05:07.974 --> 05:12.312
Isn't it? I am covered in wonder.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.272
Uh, I'm Deet.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.275
-This is Rian, Brea,
- Oh! Uh-huh...

05:17.984 --> 05:20.611
-Hup, and that's--
-Lore!

05:21.195 --> 05:22.488
Of course we know Lore.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.158
We built him to deliver our message.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.285
You left the message?

05:27.368 --> 05:29.370
That's right, wee Gelfling!

05:29.454 --> 05:32.874
Three hundred and seventy nine trine ago,
that was.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.084
Long time ago. Really long time.

05:35.793 --> 05:36.711
Uh...

05:38.129 --> 05:39.339
You're a Skeksis.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.050
- I'm a what?

05:46.179 --> 05:49.140
-That was a jest. I'm a fun Skeksis.

05:49.223 --> 05:52.894
Once I was known as skekGra,
the Conqueror,

05:52.977 --> 05:55.897
but the others cast me out
and branded me...

05:56.814 --> 05:57.815
Heretic.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.535
-Follow, Gelfling! Follow and know.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.454
Oh and bring your Podling slave.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.874
-He's not our slave, he's our friend.

06:14.957 --> 06:15.958
- Oh!

06:16.042 --> 06:18.628
Even better! Come! So much to do.

06:21.005 --> 06:21.964
Should we follow?

06:22.632 --> 06:25.843
Should run. Skeksis are <i>babolim.</i>

06:26.219 --> 06:28.513
Mmm! Crazy!

06:30.807 --> 06:32.642
We've come too far to turn back now.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.729
It's time we got some answers.

06:43.569 --> 06:47.990
Welcome to the Circle of the Suns!

07:07.969 --> 07:09.595
Are you alone here, Heretic?

07:09.679 --> 07:11.889
Yes, I am alone!

07:12.014 --> 07:13.724
So very alone.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.894
Yet I am also with myself.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.020
Hm?

07:18.521 --> 07:19.730
Hm...

07:19.897 --> 07:22.859
UrGoh, get out here and greet our guests!

07:43.379 --> 07:45.965
So slow.

07:46.048 --> 07:50.678
Mystics: four arms, but only two legs.
And neither good for much.

07:52.263 --> 07:55.183
Hurry up, come on! We haven't got all day!

07:55.892 --> 07:56.851
Mystic?

07:57.393 --> 07:58.728
-What's a Mystic?
- Yes!

07:58.811 --> 08:01.063
-I used to read tales of Mystics,
- Come on!

08:01.147 --> 08:02.899
but I thought they were just stories!

08:03.024 --> 08:03.858
Look!

08:03.941 --> 08:06.277
These are the Gelfling
that found our message.

08:06.903 --> 08:10.239
Or... did the message...

08:10.990 --> 08:13.451
-find them?

08:13.618 --> 08:15.786
Would you just introduce yourself?

08:16.996 --> 08:17.955
Yeah.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.125
-I... am...
- Yeah.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.460
Here we go.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.463
-...urGoh...
-Come on, get it out. Say it.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.089
-...the...
-Say your name.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.886
-...Wan... de...
- Wanderer. Wanderer!

08:32.053 --> 08:33.429
-...derer.
-...de...

08:33.513 --> 08:36.140
Say it! Just say Wanderer!
Just get it out there!

08:36.224 --> 08:38.726
Your name is urGoh the Wanderer!

08:38.809 --> 08:40.603
...rer.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.146
At last.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.024
I don't mean to be rude, but...

08:45.525 --> 08:48.986
we have traveled very far
because you said--

08:49.070 --> 08:51.072
-...Uh, in your message.
- Yes.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.950
In your message, that you held the key

08:54.492 --> 08:56.577
to ending Skeksis' power.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.663
Do not worry, Gelfling.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.457
Soon, all will be revealed.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.503
But, first, we have
a wonderful surprise for you.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.965
- Or... does the surprise...

09:09.257 --> 09:11.676
have... you?

09:11.759 --> 09:14.053
That doesn't even make sense.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.557
Could we just skip the surprise?

09:19.100 --> 09:22.562
-We have waited 379 trine.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.355
We're doing the surprise.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.649
And you will be surprised!

09:26.732 --> 09:30.194
I... will... prepare.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.863
Yes, good! Go prepare.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.992
There we go.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.244
Could you be any slower?

09:38.536 --> 09:41.706
Don't answer that. We'll be here all day.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.543
Lore, your quest is at its end...

09:46.127 --> 09:48.629
-Time for you to rest once again.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.134
-Wait!

09:59.515 --> 10:00.474
Goodbye...

10:05.896 --> 10:07.315
my protector.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.318
Ha!

10:10.568 --> 10:12.320
He never hugged me like that.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.531
But why should he? We only gave him life.

10:19.827 --> 10:20.661
Open.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.634
Hm. Wonderful.

10:37.136 --> 10:41.557
Now, now, the rest of you
must be tired after your journey.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.560
Rest now while we get everything ready.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.978
-Wait, but we're--
-We...

10:46.062 --> 10:48.939
-We're not really tired.
-We're on a very important quest.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.193
Nonsense.
We'll come and get you when it's time.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.987
Oh! And we'll need to borrow
your friend-slave.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.197
-Huh?

10:56.280 --> 10:57.114
What?

10:58.658 --> 10:59.742
What did he--

11:03.746 --> 11:05.289
-Wonderful.

11:05.373 --> 11:09.210
Now, the rest of you stay right in there

11:09.543 --> 11:11.962
and no peeking!

11:12.046 --> 11:14.090
No peeking.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.092
- No peeking.
-Well-- we...

11:16.550 --> 11:18.260
No peeking.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.681
Well, a surprise sounds fun.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.724
We don't have time for fun.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.185
-Huh?
-Hm?

11:35.319 --> 11:38.280
Disgusting. Ugh.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.201
I don't understand
why you brought me down here.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.452
Patience, General.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.997
-Summon the Ascendancy.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.125
But they are our sworn enemy.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.960
Not for long.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.352
-Ah!

12:21.907 --> 12:26.245
The Ascendancy hears your call.

12:26.495 --> 12:30.416
We are all Arathim as one.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.168
- As one.
- As one.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.128
Greetings, Ascendancy.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.713
Emperor.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.381
Emperor.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.549
Not welcome!

12:38.841 --> 12:41.927
But I have come to offer you
a way out of the wilds

12:42.011 --> 12:44.764
and back into our good graces,

12:45.431 --> 12:48.142
in spite of your ill-fated rebellion.

12:48.517 --> 12:52.897
We are listening.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.817
The Gelfling have turned... hmm...

12:56.984 --> 12:58.152
unruly.

12:58.652 --> 13:01.322
You will crush them, gather them,

13:01.822 --> 13:03.699
bring them to me.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.495
- Why should we do as you ask?
- Why?

13:07.578 --> 13:09.747
Become a fist for the Skeksis,

13:09.872 --> 13:13.209
and I shall return your ancestral home.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.338
-The Caves of Grot.
- Of Grot!

13:19.173 --> 13:25.513
The Arathim Ascendancy accepts your offer,

13:25.596 --> 13:30.893
but the Gelfling
will simply walk themselves

13:30.976 --> 13:33.437
into your grasp.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.439
How is this possible?

13:35.523 --> 13:38.317
Bring us a Gelfling.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.778
A strong one.

13:40.861 --> 13:45.324
Then you will understand.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.630
-We have an army.
-Mm.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.340
Now, follow me.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.634
Ah!

14:05.970 --> 14:06.846
Huh.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.227
How much longer do we have to wait?

14:14.311 --> 14:16.814
They said they'd come get us
when the surprise is ready.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.026
- But I am hungry. Are you hungry?
-Hm?

14:21.777 --> 14:22.862
Ooh!

14:27.533 --> 14:29.285
-No! Wait! Don't eat that!
-But...

14:29.785 --> 14:30.828
berries are food.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.788
-They're not.
-Huh.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.081
They're urdrupes.

14:34.164 --> 14:38.127
They're like medicine.
Dousan shamans use them to speak with Thra

14:38.878 --> 14:40.379
and glimpse into the future.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.135
Everything up here is strange.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.139
I miss my caves.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.266
I miss my family.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.101
Tell me about them.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.523
Well, I have two fathers and a brother.

14:59.648 --> 15:02.359
And my parents tend the Nurloc herds.
I help them sometimes.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.654
-What's a Nurloc?
-It's a big worm.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.741
My dress is actually made
from Nurloc rump.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.284
It's the softest...

15:10.910 --> 15:12.119
Uh...

15:12.995 --> 15:13.954
Oh.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.082
-You think I'm weird too.
- Hmm.

15:18.667 --> 15:19.543
Not at all.

15:19.960 --> 15:20.878
Mm?

15:22.046 --> 15:23.797
I think your rump dress is...

15:25.507 --> 15:26.342
quite lovely.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.054
Hmm.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.848
- Gelfling...

15:33.390 --> 15:35.601
it... is...

15:36.602 --> 15:37.519
time.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.733
-Hmm.
- Here we go.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.620
I don't see any surprises.

15:54.828 --> 15:55.704
Hm.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.165
-Sit down.
-Huh?

16:01.001 --> 16:03.963
-Oh! I guess we should sit down.
-Right, uh...

16:08.050 --> 16:09.677
And now,

16:10.386 --> 16:12.846
presenting...

16:13.931 --> 16:18.644
the true history of Thra!

16:20.813 --> 16:21.897
Wow.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.202
Hm?

16:43.669 --> 16:47.131
-In honor of Gelfling--
- Louder!

16:49.341 --> 16:52.678
-In honor of Gelfling--
- More wonder!

16:55.848 --> 16:58.851
In honor of Gelfling!

16:58.934 --> 17:00.853
Argh! Never mind!

17:00.936 --> 17:02.563
- Come on, that's enough!

17:02.646 --> 17:04.523
-Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.530
I thought he was good.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.203
-Ah!

17:19.455 --> 17:22.207
They called me the Conqueror
when I was young.

17:22.416 --> 17:26.128
From sea to sea, my victories were sung.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.673
I lied. I cursed.
I killed, I hurt, I maimed.

17:30.174 --> 17:33.927
Vile and cruel deeds
for which I was famed.

17:34.428 --> 17:38.098
Then Thra gave urGoh and me a vision.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.642
That's...

17:41.351 --> 17:42.770
my...

17:44.730 --> 17:45.689
cue.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.194
-We'll never get answers at this rate.
-No.

17:50.861 --> 17:55.240
Then Thra gave urGoh and me a vision.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.784
To...

17:57.826 --> 17:59.453
embrace...

17:59.745 --> 18:00.954
-unity,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.957
not... division.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.086
We desperately tried
to convince the rest,

18:07.169 --> 18:10.130
but Skeksis and Mystics were unimpressed.

18:10.631 --> 18:14.134
- We hold the key...
- Hold the key.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.636
-...to...
-To...

18:16.011 --> 18:17.763
-...Skeksis...
-...Skeksis...

18:17.846 --> 18:20.641
-...demise. Demise! There you go.
-...demise.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.353
But, first, an original opera.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.938
Surprise!

18:35.614 --> 18:37.282
What is an opera?

18:37.366 --> 18:39.660
Don't worry. I bet it will be great!

18:43.372 --> 18:44.373
Hello.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.460
Uh...

18:50.087 --> 18:52.422
I wish I had one of those berries
about now.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.936
Come, General.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.732
You will soon understand
why I have struck our new alliance.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.196
Ah...

19:16.405 --> 19:17.573
Yes.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.203
What is this place?

19:23.412 --> 19:25.622
Behold, the Darkening.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.250
-You decreed there is no Darkening.
-I lied!

19:28.709 --> 19:30.711
It grows day by day.

19:31.170 --> 19:35.174
Its veins creep across the land,
blighting all it touches.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.885
It's... purple.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.678
It is power.

19:40.053 --> 19:42.598
Pure, raw.

19:42.890 --> 19:46.518
It has only spread faster
since we began draining Gelfling.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.689
That is why I have given
the Caves of Grot back to the Arathim.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.482
The caves are infected.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.526
The Darkening will consume the Arathim.

19:54.610 --> 19:58.989
Now you see. The caves
will not be a home for the Arathim.

19:59.072 --> 20:01.074
It will be their grave.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.409
Huh.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.412
-You can control it?
-Not yet.

20:05.787 --> 20:10.042
On my scepter, I hold a crystal
much smaller than the Crystal of Truth,

20:10.125 --> 20:12.628
but gifted with its own unique power.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.632
In time, I will use this crystal

20:16.715 --> 20:19.009
to harness the might of the Darkening

20:19.384 --> 20:21.762
-for our greater glory.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.263
Ah...

20:26.433 --> 20:29.686
Exposure to the Darkening
is not without...

20:30.687 --> 20:31.980
consequences.

20:33.315 --> 20:37.611
It destroys, corrupts my body,
as it does all of Thra.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.948
True power demands sacrifice.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.243
Command me, sire.

20:44.826 --> 20:47.454
Choose the strongest Gelfling
from our cages

20:47.621 --> 20:49.706
and give the Ascendancy what they demand.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.417
Then bring Stone-in-the-Wood to its knees.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.502
Hm.

20:53.710 --> 20:57.756
And never forget,
there is absolutely nothing in this world

20:57.839 --> 21:00.759
that does not bend to my will.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.761
Yes, Emperor.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.906
Hush, Bennu. Hush.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.453
I imagine she's caught the scent
of the creature stalking us.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.080
What creature?

21:30.580 --> 21:31.581
Hm...

21:33.875 --> 21:35.669
The one behind you.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.838
-Greetings, Hunter.
- Ah!

21:37.921 --> 21:39.172
Rek'yr.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.552
You should not have come here, skekMal.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.263
I will not guide you on another hunt.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.807
You are a butcher.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.518
The Gelfling you transported,

21:52.269 --> 21:54.229
where are they? Talk.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.440
That I will not do.

21:58.191 --> 22:03.155
Then I will have to start
cutting pieces off you until you talk.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.533
-Go ahead. Do you want my hands?

22:06.616 --> 22:09.202
They are not mine.
They are a gift from Thra.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.998
Same as my feet, my head, my life.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.376
And his life?

22:25.552 --> 22:28.138
If this is to be the day
of our return to Thra,

22:28.263 --> 22:29.931
-then we welcome it gladly.

22:30.223 --> 22:31.808
Tell me where they are!

22:31.892 --> 22:33.894
-The Circle of the Suns.
-Silence!

22:40.150 --> 22:43.403
You will take me there
in your flying beast.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.990
Yes. Yes, my lord.
Yes. Yes, my lord.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.222
That was great!

23:10.305 --> 23:11.723
-Huh?
- Hoo!

23:12.182 --> 23:14.559
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

23:14.643 --> 23:16.770
And... now,

23:16.978 --> 23:19.189
at... last...

23:19.439 --> 23:21.066
We come to the reason<i> </i>

23:21.691 --> 23:23.402
you are all here.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.780
The key you seek is the solution

23:26.863 --> 23:29.199
to all of our travails.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.034
Finally, answers.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.661
Brought to life

23:32.744 --> 23:37.082
by that most ancient and sacred of arts.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.255
Puppetry.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.048
Yay.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.175
No.

23:56.726 --> 23:58.812
We two...

23:59.354 --> 24:01.940
were not... always

24:02.441 --> 24:04.860
the crude... flesh

24:05.152 --> 24:07.654
you see before you.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.825
Ah... ah, ah, ah, ah!

24:17.205 --> 24:18.248
Huh.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.047
Ah...

24:26.756 --> 24:31.261
Once, we were one, a single luminous form.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.637
One body,

24:33.180 --> 24:35.807
one will, one mind.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.726
We were perfect unity.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.020
We called ourselves...

24:43.648 --> 24:45.066
UrSkeks.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.028
Two thousand trine ago,<i> </i>

24:48.361 --> 24:51.156
eighteen of us left our world

24:51.323 --> 24:53.909
and came to Thra.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.622
They're from another world!

25:01.082 --> 25:03.293
We newly arrived UrSkeks

25:03.835 --> 25:05.795
filled Mother Aughra's head

25:05.879 --> 25:09.758
with stories of our adventures
amongst the stars.

25:09.883 --> 25:13.094
She longed to explore
the universe herself,

25:13.178 --> 25:16.598
so we gifted Mother Aughra with her orrery

25:17.015 --> 25:18.600
in exchange for...

25:19.059 --> 25:21.728
the Crystal of Truth.

25:22.562 --> 25:26.942
-But there can be no light...
- Without dark.

25:27.150 --> 25:32.155
We deceived Aughra and harnessed
the power of the Crystal for ourselves.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.824
Then, in our arrogance,

25:34.991 --> 25:39.996
our experiments on the Crystal
broke us into two.

25:40.121 --> 25:44.167
The Skeksis and Mystics.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.128
In the shock of division,
a skirmish arose,

25:47.212 --> 25:50.966
and the wrathful Skeksis
broke a shard from the Crystal,

25:51.049 --> 25:53.677
creating the Darkening.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.054
-Where's the shard?

25:56.137 --> 26:00.433
We were left as two halves
trapped within separate bodies.

26:00.767 --> 26:04.437
All we want now
is to return to our true form.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.025
Where two... is one.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.488
The other Mystics

26:13.613 --> 26:19.077
went into hiding
and await the day when their destiny

26:19.411 --> 26:22.956
will reveal itself at last.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.584
We tried to convince
our fellow Skeksis

26:25.667 --> 26:27.335
that we must be made whole.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.671
That is when they turned on us,

26:30.088 --> 26:31.923
branded me Heretic,

26:32.257 --> 26:34.301
and forced us into hiding.

26:37.637 --> 26:41.182
We want to be rejoined now.

26:41.641 --> 26:44.769
Every moment one are two

26:44.936 --> 26:49.399
is too terrible for one to bear.

26:49.482 --> 26:50.859
But there is hope,

26:51.151 --> 26:53.445
for we have glimpsed into the future

26:53.778 --> 26:56.573
and seen our fate lies in the hands of...

26:57.282 --> 26:58.783
the Gelfling.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.493
For the Gelfling

27:00.577 --> 27:03.496
are closest to Thra.

27:04.039 --> 27:08.627
The Skeksis will stop at nothing
to preserve their dominion over Thra.

27:09.210 --> 27:13.048
And so, we forged our knowledge
into a blade.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.508
The Dual Glaive.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.435
Cast in the deepest fires
of the inner sun,

27:25.602 --> 27:28.021
it carries the spirit of Thra,

27:28.104 --> 27:30.982
and, when wielded by Gelfling,

27:31.399 --> 27:34.361
holds the power to unite the Seven Clans

27:34.569 --> 27:37.322
-and defeat the Skeksis.
-Look!

27:49.042 --> 27:52.337
This is the sigil of great power,

27:52.796 --> 27:54.547
the Aureyal.

27:55.215 --> 27:58.426
-I know that symbol.
-I saw it in a vision.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.138
- Seven clans.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.516
Seven fires.

28:05.016 --> 28:08.645
Joined as one in the cause of unity.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.822
-Fire!
-What?

28:19.989 --> 28:22.242
- I'm on fire! Put it out!
- Oh, no!

28:22.325 --> 28:25.620
- Put it out! Put it out!

28:25.745 --> 28:28.164
- Put it out! Put it out!

28:34.546 --> 28:38.258
The power of the Aureyal
is the power of all Gelfling.

28:38.717 --> 28:43.638
Alone, you are small.
Together, you are a cleansing flame.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.473
Be that flame!

28:45.974 --> 28:47.475
Bring the many...

28:48.184 --> 28:50.687
into one.

28:52.522 --> 28:53.648
I'm ready.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.067
I'll stand against the Skeksis.

28:56.609 --> 28:58.319
I'll wield the Dual Glaive!

28:58.903 --> 29:01.364
The reign of the Skeksis will end.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.784
And you two will be one again. We promise.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.786
Wonderful!

29:06.870 --> 29:08.037
-Ah!

29:08.121 --> 29:10.749
One... problem.

29:10.832 --> 29:11.708
Hm?

29:12.292 --> 29:14.836
We don't actually have the Dual Glaive.

29:15.378 --> 29:17.338
-What?
-Oh, we are fugitives!

29:17.422 --> 29:19.424
It would not be safe in our possession.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.635
-Huh.
-So, we entrusted the Glaive

29:22.719 --> 29:25.472
to the most reclusive of Gelfling.

29:25.555 --> 29:30.727
Where the Three Brothers
dare not shine.

29:31.561 --> 29:32.562
Hm...

29:34.022 --> 29:34.981
Hm...

29:36.316 --> 29:38.485
It's in the Caves of Grot.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.487
- Huh?

29:41.237 --> 29:42.447
Very...

29:42.947 --> 29:44.157
per...

29:44.407 --> 29:45.700
-Say it.
-...cep...

29:46.034 --> 29:47.952
Say it! Say it, "perceptive".

29:48.036 --> 29:50.747
-Perceptive, get it out!
-...tive.

29:50.830 --> 29:51.956
Ah...

29:53.082 --> 29:54.584
Then Grot is where we'll go.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.796
We thank you, wise ones,

29:58.129 --> 29:59.422
for your counsel

30:00.089 --> 30:01.591
and for your surprise.

30:01.674 --> 30:02.759
Ah...

30:02.926 --> 30:04.761
It was wonderful.

30:08.014 --> 30:11.184
Hm. Hm. Hm!

30:11.601 --> 30:13.937
Hm! Hm!

30:18.775 --> 30:19.901
<i>Gather the warriors.</i>

30:20.401 --> 30:24.739
Princess Seladon has seized the crown
and sworn fealty to the Skeksis.

30:24.823 --> 30:25.990
Maudra Fara!

30:26.074 --> 30:29.077
All childlings and caregivers
are to go to the hills for safety.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.745
- I have news from--
-It can wait.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.497
Let's prepare.

30:32.664 --> 30:36.334
-We will storm the Castle of the Crystal.
- That's just it.

30:36.626 --> 30:40.755
A castle guard has come.
You will want to hear what he has to say.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.674
Are we really gonna fight the Skeksis?

30:42.757 --> 30:43.925
Is it to be war?

30:44.509 --> 30:47.428
We took up arms against the Skeksis.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.181
We were well trained. We had a plan.

30:50.598 --> 30:53.184
One of us must have warned them.
They were waiting.

30:53.268 --> 30:56.521
The entire guard was overtaken.
We never stood a chance!

30:57.647 --> 31:01.150
I only escaped because my brothers
and sisters sacrificed themselves,

31:01.985 --> 31:03.862
so that I might bring you this news.

31:13.246 --> 31:16.541
We will rain down on the Skeksis

31:17.500 --> 31:21.671
with righteous fury
and smite their plague from Thra.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.718
This I promise.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.470
- Promise?
-Huh?

31:29.554 --> 31:32.974
Promises you cannot keep
are no better than lies.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.561
I can't believe it.

31:38.438 --> 31:39.647
Mother Aughra.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.150
What is this foolishness I'm hearing?

31:42.525 --> 31:44.569
Storming Skeksis' castle?

31:44.736 --> 31:48.573
The Skeksis are predators.
We will not be their prey.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.199
- So you rush to war.

31:50.533 --> 31:52.660
Stonewood do not seek bloodshed.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.871
-When the battle is done,

31:54.954 --> 31:57.415
we cast the weapons
that vanquished our foes

31:57.498 --> 32:00.877
into the forge in the center
of our village to be melted down.

32:00.960 --> 32:01.878
Ah...

32:02.003 --> 32:03.463
For the hand that wields the blade

32:03.546 --> 32:05.590
cannot help the fallen to their feet.

32:06.424 --> 32:09.177
But there are times
when the blade is necessary.

32:09.469 --> 32:12.597
You plot strife
when you should plot survival.

32:12.680 --> 32:16.184
-You want us to run?
-I want you to live.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.894
You are Thra.

32:18.227 --> 32:19.562
The Skeksis are not.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.023
To your home you owe survival.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.370
The Skeksis will meet their fate.

32:35.703 --> 32:37.664
This I have foreseen,

32:37.747 --> 32:41.542
-but it will not be by your hand.
-Why not?

32:42.126 --> 32:45.463
If not the great warriors
of Stone-in-the-Wood, then who?

32:47.131 --> 32:49.050
The Song of Thra is complex.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.052
Many parts.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.763
No one knows the entire melody.

32:54.263 --> 32:55.682
Not even Aughra.

32:57.183 --> 32:59.185
Gelfling do not live on guesses.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.938
Gelfling live on the ground
beneath their feet.

33:02.021 --> 33:03.147
Hm...

33:03.856 --> 33:06.442
I see so many possibilities.

33:06.901 --> 33:08.361
But in all of them,

33:08.736 --> 33:13.282
if Stone-in-the-Wood falls,
terrible sacrifices will have to be made.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.618
-Stone-in-the-Wood will never fall.
-Ha!

33:15.827 --> 33:18.579
-But the Castle of the Crystal must.

33:18.705 --> 33:22.917
And I am the only one
with the strength to get it done.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.923
Can't say Aughra didn't try.

33:35.638 --> 33:36.973
Again! Again!

33:43.312 --> 33:46.065
The Ascendancy
requested our strongest Gelfling,

33:46.607 --> 33:50.236
-but these all look weak!
- Of course they do!

33:50.319 --> 33:51.738
They're Gelfling!

33:54.240 --> 33:55.366
Murderer!

33:55.450 --> 33:58.661
A-ha! This one has spirit.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.914
Ah! The orphan princess of Ha'rar.

34:01.998 --> 34:05.960
I swear on my mother's life, my blade
will be the last thing you'll ever feel!

34:06.044 --> 34:07.462
Is that right?

34:10.339 --> 34:11.257
She will do.

34:11.841 --> 34:13.384
-Gruenaks!

34:13.468 --> 34:15.470
-Take her away.
- Princess Tavra!

34:15.553 --> 34:17.346
-With haste!

34:17.638 --> 34:18.473
No.

34:20.058 --> 34:20.933
No.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.061
No! No!

34:23.144 --> 34:25.521
- No!
-To the Ascendancy!

34:25.605 --> 34:28.399
- Get away from her!
-No! No!

34:33.362 --> 34:34.447
Farewell, Lore.

34:36.449 --> 34:37.950
I'll see you again.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.167
Take... these.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.544
As they say,

34:48.920 --> 34:52.507
what's good... in the gourd

34:52.924 --> 34:56.886
is good in... the Gelfling.

34:57.136 --> 34:58.012
Hm?

34:58.387 --> 34:59.680
Who says that?

35:00.389 --> 35:02.850
Every... one.

35:02.934 --> 35:03.768
Bah!

35:05.144 --> 35:09.107
Retrieve the Dual Glaive.
End Skeksis' power.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.025
We will. Thank you.

35:15.404 --> 35:17.657
Thank you, Gelfling.

35:28.793 --> 35:32.505
- My hand!
- My hand! My hand!

35:39.929 --> 35:43.307
I've come for my trophy.
Did you think I would not find you?

35:44.684 --> 35:46.853
There's no place in Thra
you can hide from me!

35:49.355 --> 35:52.108
No... hurt... Deet!

35:53.693 --> 35:55.695
-Cute.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.116
- Hup!

36:02.743 --> 36:05.621
-Lore! You must wake Lore!

36:15.756 --> 36:18.009
-Deet.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.010
Deet?

36:21.137 --> 36:23.764
Where's your father now?

36:24.140 --> 36:25.850
Wake up, Lore. Come on, wake up.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.102
-Come on, Lore. Please!

36:37.361 --> 36:39.238
Get away from them.

36:39.572 --> 36:42.450
-Another Mystic!
-The Archer.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.287
Aah!

36:49.498 --> 36:52.084
You and I are one.

36:52.710 --> 36:56.881
You cannot defeat me
without defeating yourself.

36:57.256 --> 37:00.843
-What I feel, you feel.

37:01.552 --> 37:06.182
Perhaps,
but I will not leave empty handed.

37:10.394 --> 37:12.021
Farewell, Archer.

37:13.105 --> 37:15.441
- SkekMal! No!

37:16.651 --> 37:18.402
-Brea!
-No!

37:26.577 --> 37:29.872
Rian! Find the Glaive!
Find the Glaive!

37:34.043 --> 37:35.461
Brea!

37:41.926 --> 37:42.760
Hm.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.179
Hm.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.152
We take the castle at first light.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.655
-They have no guards nor defenses.

38:02.738 --> 38:04.448
- Maudra Fara!

38:04.865 --> 38:08.411
Maudra Fara! Maudra Fara!
The Skeksis are coming!

38:08.703 --> 38:09.578
What?

38:29.098 --> 38:30.141
What is this?

38:30.558 --> 38:31.517
Huh?

38:58.294 --> 38:59.295
Stand ready.

39:08.095 --> 39:10.723
The Arathim! They fight with the Skeksis!

39:10.806 --> 39:13.768
Sound the alarm! Weapons ready!
Everyone fights.

39:16.645 --> 39:18.481
- No mercy!

39:25.404 --> 39:26.280
-What?

39:29.158 --> 39:30.451
Why have they stopped?

39:31.327 --> 39:32.661
Why aren't they attacking?

39:45.758 --> 39:47.468
Princess Tavra?

39:55.059 --> 39:57.061
Is that Princess Tavra?

40:08.739 --> 40:10.116
Princess Tavra?

40:13.160 --> 40:17.039
Why do you stand with the very monsters
who murdered your mother?

40:19.458 --> 40:21.127
We are not...

40:22.169 --> 40:23.379
Tavra.

40:29.635 --> 40:30.845
Arathim!

40:31.762 --> 40:33.764
- Hold the line!

40:34.682 --> 40:36.725
-What's happening?

41:36.702 --> 41:38.120
Get it off!

41:49.256 --> 41:50.174
No!

41:50.257 --> 41:51.884
Hm...

41:52.301 --> 41:53.260
Hm.

41:53.802 --> 41:55.054
I am the Ascendancy.

41:55.137 --> 41:57.389
I am the Ascendancy.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.058
I am the Ascendancy.

41:59.141 --> 42:02.853
-I am the Ascendancy.
-I am the Ascendancy.

42:02.937 --> 42:04.605
I am the Ascendancy.

42:42.851 --> 42:44.645
Huh, whoa, wha-- what?

42:44.770 --> 42:45.729
Ah!

42:46.397 --> 42:47.273
What?

42:47.731 --> 42:50.317
You dare try to control Aughra?

42:50.901 --> 42:53.195
Aughra can barely control Aughra!

43:19.096 --> 43:20.180
Huh?

43:20.514 --> 43:21.640
Bah!
