01:21.280 --> 01:23.514
CINDY (over radio):
      Louie, Louie, Louie,
     where are you, Louie?

01:23.582 --> 01:24.949
Why don't you help me, Louie?

01:25.017 --> 01:26.384
Why don't you answer me, Louie?

01:26.451 --> 01:27.552
Where are you, Louie?

01:27.620 --> 01:29.387
Yeah, Bates, this is Louie.

01:29.455 --> 01:30.822
How's it goin', kiddo?

01:30.889 --> 01:33.325
I had an accident.
         I hit some ice

01:33.392 --> 01:34.626
and I spun off the road.

01:34.693 --> 01:36.261
I can't get the cab started.

01:36.328 --> 01:38.630
The window's broken,
       and I'm freezing.

01:38.697 --> 01:41.098
I'm on an unmarked country road.

01:41.166 --> 01:45.670
I got off at the Rocks Hill exit
  of the Garden State Parkway.

01:45.738 --> 01:48.206
I don't know where I am.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.708
Louie...

01:49.775 --> 01:51.609
All right, okay, Bates,
          Bates, calm down here.

01:51.677 --> 01:54.078
Now, how do you
           expect me to help you
           if you're hysterical?

01:54.146 --> 01:56.013
I'm sorry.
      You're right, Louie.

01:56.081 --> 01:57.449
Okay, okay, Louie.

01:57.517 --> 01:58.549
I'm calm.

01:58.617 --> 01:59.817
All right, that's better.

01:59.885 --> 02:01.685
Now, let's think.

02:01.753 --> 02:03.021
She's doomed.

02:04.223 --> 02:07.658
Louie, I know where
         this woman is.

02:07.726 --> 02:09.727
Is right near
the farm where Simka and I

02:09.794 --> 02:12.297
buy our goat knuckles.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.899
So?
So, I want to go
and bring her back.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.035
No, no, no, Latka,
             I can't let you go.

02:17.102 --> 02:18.136
It's too dangerous.

02:18.204 --> 02:20.905
Let him go, Louie.
          Let him go.

02:20.973 --> 02:22.740
Louie, please, I'm so...

02:22.808 --> 02:25.109
(static crackles)

02:25.177 --> 02:27.112
Bates! Bates!

02:28.347 --> 02:31.549
Ah, her radio just quit.

02:33.285 --> 02:35.586
Latka, you can't go out there.
             It's too dangerous.

02:35.654 --> 02:37.655
No, no, listen,
       where I come from,

02:37.723 --> 02:39.390
we live every day with danger.

02:39.458 --> 02:40.558
We laugh at danger.

02:40.625 --> 02:43.127
Ha, ha, ha.

02:43.195 --> 02:46.031
You call... you call this
    danger-- a little snow?

02:46.098 --> 02:48.165
Ha, come on.
     Where are the wolves?

02:48.233 --> 02:49.968
Where are the wild boars?

02:50.035 --> 02:51.836
Where are
the avalanches?

02:53.638 --> 02:55.574
Where are my mittens?

03:01.146 --> 03:04.882
(wind howling)
        (Latka moaning)

03:04.950 --> 03:09.621
(moaning continues)

03:09.688 --> 03:13.792
Oh! Oh! Oh!

03:15.928 --> 03:18.630
Excuse me! Excuse me!

03:20.065 --> 03:22.166
Are you Cindy Bates?

03:22.234 --> 03:23.168
Yes!

03:23.235 --> 03:25.970
Of the Sunshine Cab Company?

03:26.038 --> 03:28.807
Yes! Yes!

03:28.874 --> 03:30.742
Never hurts to check, you know.

03:30.809 --> 03:32.343
(chuckles)
           All right.

03:32.411 --> 03:35.146
Oh, oh, oh...
             What are you doing?
                   I'm freezing.

03:35.214 --> 03:38.415
Let's just go get in your tow
      truck and get out of here.
(moaning)

03:38.483 --> 03:40.852
Oh, that would be
terrific if we could,

03:40.919 --> 03:44.088
but, you see, it's buried
in a snowbank three miles back.

03:44.156 --> 03:46.157
(resumes moaning)

03:46.224 --> 03:48.192
Well, maybe you could do
        something with this cab?

03:48.260 --> 03:50.261
I-I'll take a look.

03:50.329 --> 03:52.263
(engine sputters)

03:54.600 --> 03:55.666
(grunts)

03:55.734 --> 03:57.835
Oh, I think I know
what the problem is.

03:57.903 --> 03:58.836
What?

03:58.904 --> 04:00.705
Winter.

04:00.772 --> 04:02.173
(grunts)

04:02.241 --> 04:05.777
Oh, come on, turn that
frown upside down.

04:05.845 --> 04:08.013
I'm freezing.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.448
You want my coat?

04:11.917 --> 04:13.851
All right. Here.

04:15.854 --> 04:18.389
(moaning)

04:18.457 --> 04:21.492
Oh, I hope it is
the right size for you.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.129
Oh, oh, here.

04:24.196 --> 04:26.097
Oh, here you go.

04:26.165 --> 04:28.099
(continues moaning)

04:30.302 --> 04:32.002
Oh!

04:32.070 --> 04:34.005
(spitting)

04:34.073 --> 04:36.841
(continues moaning)

04:37.943 --> 04:39.810
Y-You want my scarf?

04:41.947 --> 04:44.282
Here.

04:44.349 --> 04:46.284
(resumes moaning)

04:51.056 --> 04:52.957
What?

04:55.294 --> 04:56.727
All right.

04:56.795 --> 04:58.963
Here you go.

04:59.031 --> 05:01.065
Oh!

05:01.133 --> 05:03.067
(moaning)

05:04.436 --> 05:05.503
Oh!

05:05.571 --> 05:07.738
Thank you.
You're welcome.

05:08.941 --> 05:10.007
It's no good.
    Why?

05:10.075 --> 05:11.308
We're still going
              to freeze to death

05:11.376 --> 05:13.477
with the wind coming
     through that broken window.

05:15.580 --> 05:17.248
No problem.

05:23.422 --> 05:26.091
(moaning)

05:28.694 --> 05:30.929
(continues moaning)

05:39.938 --> 05:43.708
(continues moaning)

05:43.775 --> 05:45.376
That should do it.

05:45.444 --> 05:48.312
I feel terrible that
          you're going to freeze
            to death to save me.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.314
I am?

05:52.651 --> 05:54.418
We could share your coat.

05:54.486 --> 05:55.819
Okay, thank you.

05:55.887 --> 05:57.455
That's very nice of you.

05:58.557 --> 05:59.823
Oh, yeah.

05:59.891 --> 06:01.759
(moaning)

06:09.301 --> 06:11.369
Latka?
         What?

06:11.436 --> 06:14.505
Am I paranoid, or are we
       going to freeze to death?

06:14.572 --> 06:16.807
What does "paranoid" mean?

06:16.875 --> 06:19.744
Is it just
                 my imagination?

06:19.812 --> 06:21.346
Is it just a
                strange thought?

06:21.413 --> 06:23.081
Oh, no, no, no,
you're not paranoid.

06:23.148 --> 06:25.083
Don't worry, we're
going to freeze to death.

06:26.652 --> 06:27.818
We are?

06:27.886 --> 06:30.855
Yes, we are.
It is unavoidable.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.925
But, but you know what
is the terrible thing?

06:33.992 --> 06:35.994
I am going to be brave
in the face of death

06:36.061 --> 06:37.929
and my wife
won't ever know.

06:37.996 --> 06:41.132
She'll think I died
the sniveling coward
that I lived.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.067
Don't, don't give
                  up yet, Latka.

06:43.135 --> 06:45.269
We have to do
            something, and fast.

06:45.337 --> 06:46.971
I'm beginning
                    to get numb.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.541
Oh, but... but
what can we do?

06:49.608 --> 06:51.543
(wind howling, Latka moaning)

06:52.611 --> 06:55.179
(mutters)
                We can have sex.

06:55.246 --> 06:57.715
I'm sorry.
I cannot hear too well.

06:57.783 --> 07:00.485
I stood too close to the cannon
at my father's funeral.

07:00.552 --> 07:01.852
No, no, no.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.587
You... no, you were
                  hearing right.

07:03.655 --> 07:05.990
The heat from our bodies
        will help us to survive.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.726
Yeah, but I can't.
I'm a married man.

07:08.793 --> 07:10.795
This is too perfect.

07:10.862 --> 07:12.864
I actually get to
             die from rejection.

07:12.931 --> 07:15.500
Oh, no, no, no,
is not personal.

07:15.568 --> 07:18.235
Is nothing personal.
I am a married man.

07:19.471 --> 07:21.405
It's a very simple
                  choice, Latka.

07:21.473 --> 07:24.308
Either you have sex with me
         or you freeze to death.

07:25.410 --> 07:27.378
Sex, death...

07:27.445 --> 07:30.848
Sex, death, hmm...

07:34.886 --> 07:37.822
Why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

07:41.760 --> 07:43.361
Now, that's wonderful.

07:43.429 --> 07:45.863
Yes. Thank you for calling.

07:47.398 --> 07:50.668
The state police found them,
     and they're all right.

07:50.736 --> 07:54.706
(applause and cheering)

07:54.773 --> 07:56.707
Thank you.

08:00.278 --> 08:02.080
I feel complete.

08:03.448 --> 08:05.149
I feel wanted.

08:05.217 --> 08:07.085
I've joined the family.

08:07.152 --> 08:09.086
What are you
             talking about, Jim?

08:12.858 --> 08:16.327
"Dear Jim Ignatowski,
 we are pleased to welcome you

08:16.395 --> 08:19.563
"as a member of our family of
 satisfied MasterCard holders.

08:19.631 --> 08:22.166
(Elaine chuckles)

08:22.234 --> 08:25.169
Your card will
                arrive shortly."

08:25.237 --> 08:26.503
Family.
Yeah.

08:26.571 --> 08:28.906
A family.

08:28.974 --> 08:31.509
I've joined the family.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.912
Me. Jim Ignatowski.

08:33.979 --> 08:34.946
ALEX:
Nah...

08:35.013 --> 08:37.115
No, no, Jim,
     you see, in this case

08:37.182 --> 08:39.850
"family" is being used
in a sort of, uh...

08:39.918 --> 08:41.552
Well, it's a figure of speech.

08:41.619 --> 08:44.087
I mean, uh, it's a kind of a
cute advertising way of...

08:44.155 --> 08:46.624
Don't badmouth my family, Alex.

08:46.692 --> 08:47.625
(mouthing)

08:53.198 --> 08:55.032
Hey! Our hero!

08:55.100 --> 08:57.001
(excited greetings)

08:57.069 --> 08:58.803
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.738
Please, Elaine, I
           have no more to give.

09:03.541 --> 09:05.576
Can I please talk to you alone?

09:05.644 --> 09:07.211
I have a troubled soul.

09:07.279 --> 09:08.946
What is it?
    What is it? What is it?

09:09.014 --> 09:10.748
Hey, this is private!

09:13.418 --> 09:16.287
What is it, Latka? What's,
   what's, what's, what's wrong?

09:16.355 --> 09:18.822
I, I have been...
               You're considered
                    a hero here.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.091
Don't you know that?

09:20.159 --> 09:21.158
I am not a hero.

09:21.226 --> 09:23.828
I am a stinkbug.

09:23.895 --> 09:25.997
I have been unfaithful to Simka.

09:26.064 --> 09:27.732
What? Come here.

09:27.799 --> 09:29.333
What-what are
              you talking about?

09:29.401 --> 09:32.002
It-it, it happened
        when Cindy and I

09:32.070 --> 09:33.737
were waiting to be rescued.
                           Yeah.

09:33.805 --> 09:35.172
This will destroy Simka.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.341
I-I don't know what should I do?

09:37.409 --> 09:40.278
Well, uh...

09:40.346 --> 09:42.480
You're not going
     to tell her, are you?

09:42.547 --> 09:43.881
I have to.

09:43.949 --> 09:45.616
She knows me so well,
         she will know.

09:45.684 --> 09:47.551
Believe me.
          No, no, no, no, Latka,

09:47.619 --> 09:49.020
you can't hurt her just so

09:49.087 --> 09:50.521
you should feel
     a little less guilty.

09:50.588 --> 09:53.558
I mean, the bigger thing here is
    to... is to spare Simka.

09:53.625 --> 09:56.627
I mean, it was a one
and one time only thing, right?

09:56.695 --> 09:58.229
I mean, it's not going
    to happen again, is it?

09:58.296 --> 10:00.364
Eh...
                          Is it?

10:00.432 --> 10:02.900
No, no.
                     Good, good.

10:02.967 --> 10:04.435
Yeah, that's right.

10:04.503 --> 10:08.239
Th-The only decent thing
    to do is to deceive her.

10:08.307 --> 10:11.041
Whew! What a relief.

10:15.180 --> 10:17.114
Wait a minute.

10:19.951 --> 10:23.721
How am I going to explain
     the scratches on my back?

10:25.490 --> 10:27.725
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
         that's right.

10:27.792 --> 10:29.727
They were on her back.

10:32.531 --> 10:34.865
I am lucky that you
  are coming over to my house

10:34.933 --> 10:36.000
for dinner tonight.

10:36.068 --> 10:37.434
Huh? Oh, wow.

10:37.502 --> 10:38.836
I almost forgot about that.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.871
Uh, hey, but under
      the circumstances...

10:40.939 --> 10:43.507
Under the circumstances
  if I'm going to deceive her,

10:43.575 --> 10:45.109
everything has to look normal.

10:45.177 --> 10:46.944
She's expecting you,
           you come.

10:47.012 --> 10:48.412
Come on.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.351
(door unlocking)

11:01.460 --> 11:03.127
Hi, honey, I'm home.

11:03.195 --> 11:04.128
Latka!

11:04.196 --> 11:06.530
I'm so happy. I...

11:06.598 --> 11:09.367
You did it with
                  another woman!

11:23.781 --> 11:24.882
Simka, darling...

11:24.950 --> 11:26.884
Don't "darling" me.

11:26.952 --> 11:28.820
Who is she?

11:28.887 --> 11:31.288
Who was the lowlife
              that would let you

11:31.356 --> 11:33.657
have your way with her?

11:33.725 --> 11:34.925
Well, listen,
I'll just run along now.

11:34.993 --> 11:36.294
I've got to...
            So soon?

11:36.361 --> 11:37.695
You just got here.

11:37.763 --> 11:40.531
Yes, you see,
                  in our country

11:40.598 --> 11:41.899
we have manners.

11:41.967 --> 11:45.002
The most important
             thing is the guest.

11:45.070 --> 11:47.838
Forget that our lives
              are falling apart.

11:47.906 --> 11:50.374
The damn guest must come first.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.744
Here, damn guest.

11:55.147 --> 11:58.048
Now, you have no problems.

11:58.116 --> 11:59.783
Eat hearty!

11:59.851 --> 12:01.318
And you!

12:01.386 --> 12:03.220
I want names!

12:03.288 --> 12:05.222
Who is she?!

12:05.290 --> 12:08.159
I don't know what
           you're talking about.

12:08.226 --> 12:09.894
SIMKA:
                           Oh...

12:12.097 --> 12:13.530
Really?

12:13.598 --> 12:14.531
Yes.
        Latka...

12:14.599 --> 12:16.066
What?

12:16.134 --> 12:17.534
Look me in the eye.

12:17.602 --> 12:21.672
If you can look me in
the eye and tell me

12:21.740 --> 12:26.210
that you did not have
fleshy union with another woman,

12:26.278 --> 12:30.547
I will believe you.

12:33.251 --> 12:35.920
I did not have fleshy
       union with another woman.

12:35.987 --> 12:37.355
Ha!

12:37.422 --> 12:39.190
Okay, I did. I am sorry.

12:39.257 --> 12:40.391
Please forgive me.

12:42.494 --> 12:44.762
Oh, my God!
          Simka, it was nothing,
               really, it was...

12:44.830 --> 12:46.864
But you don't understand
         the reason why I did...

12:46.932 --> 12:47.965
Simka, but...
          Oh, my God!

12:48.033 --> 12:50.301
But listen, you
                must understand.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.169
I'll just grab a burger
        on my way home.

12:52.237 --> 12:53.771
You don't have
       to worry about me.

12:55.206 --> 12:58.141
Please, you are making
        the guest uncomfortable.

12:58.209 --> 12:59.143
No, no, no,

12:59.210 --> 13:00.811
hey, hey, hey...

13:00.879 --> 13:03.180
Oh, oh, excuse me.

13:03.248 --> 13:05.515
The damn guest is uncomfortable?

13:07.386 --> 13:09.386
Oh, are you uncomfortable?

13:09.454 --> 13:10.655
No, not really.

13:10.722 --> 13:12.390
Then sit down!

13:14.392 --> 13:18.862
Now, you see?
        The damn guest is happy.

13:20.999 --> 13:24.001
Okay, Latka...

13:24.069 --> 13:29.240
maybe there is something that I
       don't understand.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.475
Why did you do it?

13:32.577 --> 13:36.013
This better be
                      darn good.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.287
I did it for you.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.493
Go on.

13:49.561 --> 13:53.130
Or are those the last
        words you will ever say?

13:57.169 --> 14:02.539
I... I thought I was never
    going to see you again.

14:02.607 --> 14:03.874
It was below freezing,

14:03.942 --> 14:06.210
and it was the only way
      we could keep warm.

14:06.278 --> 14:08.579
We might have died.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.388
That's true. That's true.

14:17.456 --> 14:19.256
In-In the garage
    he's considered a hero.

14:20.926 --> 14:21.858
Oh.

14:23.928 --> 14:26.196
But really,
i-it's the only reason.

14:26.264 --> 14:27.664
It was just to
save our lives.

14:27.732 --> 14:30.835
Simka, it-it was you
         I was kissing.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.903
It was you I was caressing.

14:32.971 --> 14:34.905
It was you I was...

14:34.972 --> 14:37.240
Eh...

14:40.212 --> 14:43.280
Take my word for it, it was you.

14:45.550 --> 14:46.984
Okay.

14:49.087 --> 14:51.622
(sighs)
   What I am going to do now

14:51.690 --> 14:55.492
is I am going to pack a bag
    so that you can go and spend

14:55.560 --> 14:58.562
the rest of your life
                 someplace else.

14:58.630 --> 15:00.398
Oh, no. Uh...

15:00.465 --> 15:01.598
But Simk... No.

15:01.666 --> 15:05.001
Packing a bag for Latka!

15:05.069 --> 15:06.470
Simka, no...
Simka, please.

15:06.537 --> 15:07.471
Is not necessary.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.406
Hey, hey,
come on, Simka.

15:09.474 --> 15:13.043
(yelling in native language)

15:13.111 --> 15:15.179
Come on, Simka,
           think it over, Simka.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.481
(muttering in native language)
You guys can
talk about it...

15:17.549 --> 15:19.183
Let's talk about it.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.352
Come on, it can't
be that serious.
       (dishes breaking)

15:22.420 --> 15:24.087
Well, listen, I've
  overstayed my welcome here.
                       (screams)

15:24.155 --> 15:25.388
I'll be seeing you guys.

15:25.456 --> 15:27.758
Good night.
Please. Let me go.
      Oh, no, no, no, no.

15:27.826 --> 15:29.960
Listen, if you leave, she might
     stop hiding her anger.

15:30.028 --> 15:30.961
(shrieks)

15:32.164 --> 15:36.900
No, no, Latka, let him go.

15:36.968 --> 15:39.570
It was just
           lovely having you.

15:39.638 --> 15:46.176
Next time, bring some
     of your damn friends.

15:46.244 --> 15:48.479
Okay, good night,
you guys. I, uh...

15:48.547 --> 15:51.582
Listen, uh, you know,

15:51.649 --> 15:55.318
I-I feel kind of funny
because, well, I can see

15:55.386 --> 15:57.888
you're having some
minor difficulties

15:57.956 --> 16:01.325
that might affect your future,
but, uh, I just want you to know

16:01.392 --> 16:02.826
that I-I think
you're both great.

16:02.894 --> 16:06.596
And Simka, I know
            you love Latka.

16:06.664 --> 16:08.231
If you just talk
             to him calmly,

16:08.299 --> 16:09.734
there'll be
nothing to wor...

16:22.681 --> 16:26.583
Simka, do you really
         want me to go?

16:30.555 --> 16:32.756
I don't know what I want.

16:35.860 --> 16:39.396
Latka, we must go to the priest.

16:39.463 --> 16:42.165
You must confess your sin

16:42.233 --> 16:46.303
and whatever he
          advises, we must obey.

16:48.673 --> 16:51.508
I'm sorry I hurt you.

16:51.576 --> 16:55.245
Yeah, well, let's
               not talk anymore.

17:04.856 --> 17:06.624
(knocking at door)

17:06.691 --> 17:08.157
(speaking native language)

17:12.963 --> 17:15.665
Ah, Latka, Simka.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.501
(speaking
native language)

17:20.372 --> 17:23.807
(speaking native language)

17:26.042 --> 17:27.978
(speaking native language)

17:43.895 --> 17:46.730
(speaking native language)

17:48.266 --> 17:50.200
(knock at door)

17:50.267 --> 17:51.335
(speaks native language)

17:53.071 --> 17:56.173
(speaks native language)
            Hello, Latka, Simka.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.741
Please forgive
         the intrusion.

17:57.809 --> 17:59.009
This will only
         take a moment.

17:59.077 --> 18:02.179
(whispers indistinctly)

18:02.247 --> 18:05.849
I happened to run into some
      ladies who missed the bus,

18:05.917 --> 18:07.584
and, uh, they
           expressed a desire

18:07.652 --> 18:09.820
to visit the church and
             see Reverend Gorky.

18:09.888 --> 18:10.921
<i>Ibida.</i>

18:10.988 --> 18:12.223
Good.

18:13.792 --> 18:14.958
Come in, ladies.

18:15.026 --> 18:17.428
Make yourselves at home.

18:17.495 --> 18:20.397
Excellent.

18:20.465 --> 18:22.799
(speaking native language)

18:22.867 --> 18:26.370
He wants to know if you would
like to see an unburdening.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.973
It's our religion's
equivalent of a confession.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.541
Sure.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.578
Mascha? Eh...

18:34.646 --> 18:38.682
I, I don't know if
    this is such a hot idea.

18:41.953 --> 18:46.857
What I have to confess is of a
  deepest, most personal nature.

18:46.925 --> 18:49.559
(whispers)

18:49.627 --> 18:51.761
(speaking native language)

18:56.601 --> 18:58.302
"Providence has
           brought them.

18:58.369 --> 19:00.504
"There is no accidents.

19:00.572 --> 19:01.872
You shall stay."

19:11.683 --> 19:13.617
All right.

19:15.753 --> 19:18.622
(speaking native language)

19:18.690 --> 19:19.756
(laughing)

19:19.824 --> 19:22.259
He says he hopes Reverend Gorky

19:22.327 --> 19:24.795
won't be shocked by
         anything he has to say.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.863
(speaking native language)

19:26.931 --> 19:29.533
Reverend Gorky says
         Latka cannot shock him.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.903
(speaking native language)

19:32.970 --> 19:36.172
He has already heard a man who
 raised his voice to his mother.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.510
(Gorky speaking
native language)

19:39.577 --> 19:43.180
Another who gave false coin to
   gain admission to the subway.

19:45.050 --> 19:49.886
(speaking native language)

19:49.954 --> 19:51.488
So how bad can it be?

20:00.965 --> 20:04.167
(speaking native language)

20:04.235 --> 20:07.637
He said, "I am troubled
and seek your wisdom."

20:07.705 --> 20:09.739
(speaking native language)

20:12.210 --> 20:16.146
"I had meaningless sex with
a woman from the garage."

20:23.421 --> 20:26.556
(speaking native language)

20:26.624 --> 20:29.760
"I have been unfaithful
to my wife and a disgrace

20:29.828 --> 20:31.762
to my family."

20:31.829 --> 20:34.364
(wailing in native language)

20:44.342 --> 20:47.511
"I only want for things
to be the way they were

20:47.578 --> 20:50.414
"between Simka and me and,
for Simka to forgive me

20:50.481 --> 20:52.582
and to save
                  our marriage."

20:52.650 --> 20:54.183
<i>Ibida,</i> Gorky!

20:56.087 --> 20:59.722
<i>Ibida! Ibida! Ibida!</i>

21:01.792 --> 21:03.760
"Please help us,
Reverend Gorky.

21:03.828 --> 21:05.895
Please, please, please."

21:07.899 --> 21:11.000
And now I believe
              the Reverend Gorky

21:11.068 --> 21:14.004
will impart his sage
             and profound wisdom

21:14.072 --> 21:16.073
and counsel the sinner.

21:20.311 --> 21:22.079
(deep voice):
             Latka.

21:22.146 --> 21:23.980
(imitating Gorky):
                        "Latka."

21:36.227 --> 21:38.162
(speaking native language)

21:45.269 --> 21:47.204
This is most fascinating.

21:47.272 --> 21:51.275
He says since Latka sinned
with someone he worked with,

21:51.342 --> 21:55.512
Simka must sin with
someone she works with.

21:55.579 --> 21:58.014
(speaking native language)

21:58.082 --> 22:01.151
But Simka doesn't work.

22:01.218 --> 22:03.954
(speaking native language)

22:07.759 --> 22:12.095
So Simka must sin with
someone Latka works with.

22:17.268 --> 22:19.036
(speaking native language)

22:19.103 --> 22:21.505
And now we must
leave them alone.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.454
You see what we must do now,

22:37.522 --> 22:41.825
just because you did
                not want to die?

22:41.893 --> 22:45.329
You mean, you are going
    to go through with this?

22:45.397 --> 22:47.998
Latka--

22:48.065 --> 22:50.867
we are religious people.

22:50.935 --> 22:54.438
We are orthodox.

22:54.506 --> 22:58.075
Our church has told us
                what we must do,

22:58.142 --> 23:01.545
and we must obey if
       we are to remain married.

23:01.612 --> 23:05.015
You mean to tell me

23:05.082 --> 23:07.518
you are going to sleep
    with one of my friends?

23:13.124 --> 23:16.193
Baby, you're the greatest.

23:29.406 --> 23:32.810
(theme song playing)

23:55.266 --> 23:56.900
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:56.968 --> 23:58.068
(man grumbling)
