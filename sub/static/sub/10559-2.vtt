01:36.600 --> 01:40.718
Sir, this chap was walking his dog
when he discovered the body.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.399
He's had quite a shock.

01:42.640 --> 01:43.868
Understandably.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.917
And the body wasn't disturbed
in any way?

01:46.120 --> 01:49.396
No sir, it was found where it lies.
Or, where it is, I suppose.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.590
- His head, sir, it's...
- Rotated,

01:54.680 --> 01:56.318
a hundred and eighty degrees.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.716
The sheer force required
to do something inhuman.

01:59.800 --> 02:02.917
Yes, George,
that thought had crossed my mind.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.477
Are you serious, Murdoch?
A soldier's head, back to front?

02:10.160 --> 02:11.798
A rather disquieting sight, sir.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.678
And the body tossed up into a tree?

02:14.320 --> 02:15.753
So it would appear, yes.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.031
Bloody hell. That's pure dead weight
to be throwing around like a rag doll.

02:19.320 --> 02:23.233
Sir, the circumstances would suggest
the killer is highly determined.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.433
Highly determined?
A deranged ape is what he is.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.876
And what the hell was this soldier doing
running around out there to begin with?

02:29.960 --> 02:31.393
I've contacted the Armoury, sir.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.358
Perhaps the military's representative
will have an explanation.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.437
He's due at the morgue shortly.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.798
Just mind that you stand your ground.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.509
I'm sorry, sir?

02:40.600 --> 02:43.592
Well, in my experience,
the military takes care of its own.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.713
They won't enjoy the constabulary
looking into their business.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.074
I see.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.555
I'll proceed with respect
and authority of law.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.395
Authority first, Murdoch,
and respect will follow.

02:55.720 --> 02:56.948
Death was instantaneous.

02:57.040 --> 03:00.112
The victim's third,
fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae

03:00.240 --> 03:02.470
were shattered,
transecting the spinal column.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.755
Yes, I believe the term is
"death by spinal shock. "

03:04.920 --> 03:06.956
Oh, been to the library again, have you?

03:08.080 --> 03:11.675
Anyway, key items of interest are
multiple broken ribs,

03:11.800 --> 03:15.554
shattered femur, ruptured spleen,
but there is no bruising.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.830
Meaning that the victim was
severely beaten after he was dead.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.309
Rage, suggesting a personal aspect.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.232
Mmm. I remember a case in London -

03:24.320 --> 03:29.394
a group of hooligans beat a lad for
a full half hour after he'd succumbed,

03:30.480 --> 03:31.595
just for the fun of it.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.669
Point taken.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.634
You didn't mention these
bruises on the upper arm and torso.

03:36.720 --> 03:37.914
They've yellowed.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.709
Clearly the victim endured a beating
previous to last night.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.314
Important information, Doctor.

03:43.600 --> 03:47.479
Do you have any other observations or
shall I continue with my examination?

03:49.400 --> 03:50.753
Colonel Heywood.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.753
Of the Queen's Canadian Rifles.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.310
What is this?
A bloody reception hall?

03:58.200 --> 03:59.553
Detective William Murdoch.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.517
And this is our pathologist Dr Francis.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.878
Fine. May I?

04:05.120 --> 04:06.348
Yes, of course.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.634
He's one of our own.
Corporal Joseph Fryer.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.189
My condolences.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.112
You weren't specific over
the telephone, Detective.

04:16.079 --> 04:18.310
Was it a fall then? An accident?

04:18.399 --> 04:20.118
No, sir, he was murdered.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.959
I want the body released to
the Armoury immediately, Detective.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.435
- Oh.
- Dr Henderson, our medical officer

04:26.560 --> 04:29.836
will perform our own post-mortem,
while you hunt down the killer.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.992
I don't wish to offend you, Dr Francis.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.635
Oh, I bet you don't.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.472
Begging your pardon, Colonel,

04:36.560 --> 04:38.232
but I'll be deciding
when the body is to be released.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.554
Detective Murdoch!

04:40.640 --> 04:42.153
It would be most helpful
if you could explain

04:42.240 --> 04:44.515
Corporal Fryer's presence
in the woods last night.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.194
I'm sure it would be helpful, if I knew.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.998
I take that to mean your man
was absent without leave?

04:51.120 --> 04:53.190
I'll have to refer you
to his commanding officer,

04:53.720 --> 04:56.837
Major Gregory Cole
of the British 191 st Fusiliers.

04:56.920 --> 05:01.391
He's here on loan to train
some of our men. Now, if that is all?

05:02.600 --> 05:03.919
Yes, sir, that is all.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.398
Made another friend there, have you?

05:22.200 --> 05:24.350
Excuse me, I'm looking for Major Cole.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.674
<i>En garde!</i>

05:31.560 --> 05:32.788
Charge!

05:33.400 --> 05:34.753
<i>Group one, en garde!</i>

05:34.840 --> 05:36.159
Charge!

05:36.720 --> 05:38.472
<i>Group Two, en garde, charge!</i>

05:39.200 --> 05:40.679
Get stuck in there.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.273
<i>Group one, en garde, charge!</i>

05:43.360 --> 05:44.759
<i>Group two, en garde, charge!</i>

05:46.480 --> 05:47.799
Section, stand down.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.839
State your business, sir.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.475
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.518
I'm here to investigate
the death of Corporal Joseph Fryer.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.592
Yes, Detective, this way please.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.994
Huh!

06:01.080 --> 06:03.878
We were devastated when
Colonel Heywood broke the news.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.359
Corporal Fryer was well liked.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.075
And as promising a soldier
as I've had the pleasure to train.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.350
Do you know of anyone
who may have wished him harm?

06:10.800 --> 06:12.518
Nobody that I'm aware of, Detective.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.348
Certainly not amongst my men.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.595
This team is a close-knit group.
All for one, as it were.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.029
I see.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.953
Well, feel free to ask the men
any questions about the corporal.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.873
They want nothing more than
his killer brought to justice.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.314
As do I.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.557
Very good. Thank you, Major.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.634
Thank you, gentlemen.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.631
It's our pleasure.
Thank you, sir.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.873
Corporal Ned Young, sir.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.314
Corporal Raymond Tennant, sir.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.719
Detective William Murdoch.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.835
Were both of you gentlemen
in the barracks last night?

06:45.240 --> 06:48.994
Yes, sir. I have the bunk above Fryer's,
and Corporal Young, the one adjacent.

06:49.680 --> 06:53.514
When did you become aware that Corporal
Fryer was no longer in the Armoury?

06:53.960 --> 06:55.791
Right before roll call this morning,
at five.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.474
All the other lads
were surprised to see him gone, too.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.198
I thought maybe he went on
a midnight prowl.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.119
Cynthia is her name.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.312
I highly doubt Corporal Fryer
rendezvoused with his sweetheart

07:06.400 --> 07:08.391
armed with his Lee-Enfield rifle.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.919
I can see your point, sir.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.038
We want whoever did this
hanging from a rope.

07:13.320 --> 07:18.110
Yes, well, do either of you recall
this Cynthia's last name?

07:20.080 --> 07:21.479
You're certain it's him?

07:21.720 --> 07:23.711
Unfortunately, yes, Miss Fletcher.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.197
If Joseph was out wandering late,
it wasn't to see me.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.750
Whoever she is, I don't know her name.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.749
I can assure you Corporal Fryer
was not pursuing amorous activity.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.159
Cold comfort, I'm sure.

07:37.240 --> 07:42.394
In any case, here I am, twenty five,
three months of courtship wasted.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.431
And, in your time together, how would
you describe your relationship?

07:49.080 --> 07:51.594
Oh, when we first met,
he was all things.

07:52.480 --> 07:56.678
Charming, confident and very energetic.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.194
Had that changed?

07:58.800 --> 08:01.360
Well, lately I did notice
Joseph was having his moods.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.758
And he wouldn't talk about it,
but something was bothering him.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.991
Can you hazard a guess as to
what that may have been?

08:07.720 --> 08:08.914
No.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.229
Right.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.118
Had he been quarrelling
with anyone as of late?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.799
There was one night last week.

08:17.680 --> 08:21.309
Joseph was on leave.
He came by for a... visit.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.913
He'd been in a fight.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.159
He was full of curses for
a man named Laughton, I believe.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.396
And Joseph's lip was bleeding
on my floor. I sent him away promptly.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.674
Naturally.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.591
And did he mention where
he had been that evening?

08:35.039 --> 08:38.157
He was in his cups. The Raven and Flag.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.829
Will this take long, Detective? I have
thirsty patrons needing eye-openers.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.038
Please have a seat, Mr Skinner.

08:50.840 --> 08:54.276
I understand a Joseph Fryer
frequented your establishment.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.151
Yes, he was a regular
till a few weeks ago.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.795
Yet someone told me
that he had an altercation

08:59.880 --> 09:01.836
with one of your patrons there
just a short while ago.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.194
A man named Laughton.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.357
Not at the Raven and Flag, he didn't.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.909
And I've never heard of a man
named Laughton before.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.114
Pardon me, Mr Skinner.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.999
Thank you.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.469
You're sure Mr Fryer didn't participate
in any fights at your establishment?

09:24.360 --> 09:25.998
Specifically in the back room?

09:26.680 --> 09:27.954
The back room?

09:28.200 --> 09:32.239
Yes. My constables discovered
a boxing venue there,

09:32.760 --> 09:34.079
as well as these.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.039
Teeth? So what?

09:37.560 --> 09:38.788
You shutting me down?

09:39.480 --> 09:41.789
Tell me what I want to know
about Fryer and we'll see.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.514
Yeah, he fought there.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.232
He was a damn fine pugilist too.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.072
For a while, he was winning
all the bloody time.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.518
What about Mr Laughton?
Tell me what you know about him.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.511
I honestly have never heard
of that man before.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.874
I swear it.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.600
And it has been a few weeks
since anybody's seen Fryer.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.549
Most likely due to the fact that he
lost every fight in the past month.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.031
Perhaps he was wagering against himself.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.429
No, no, no, no.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.274
He just couldn't fight.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.518
It was almost like
he was dead punch drunk.

10:09.280 --> 10:12.511
So a brawling soldier on a winning
streak suddenly goes soft and moody.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.431
Someone named Laughton gave him
the bloody lip last week,

10:14.520 --> 10:16.192
but you don't know
where that took place.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.158
No one knows why Fryer went AWOL.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.033
And not a single murder suspect's
stinking up my jail cells.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.675
I miss anything, Murdoch?

10:25.080 --> 10:27.469
Sir, the humiliation of losing
could be motive.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.232
Fryer had been winning most of
his matches for quite some time.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.515
Perhaps one of his opponents
was getting even.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.474
Getting even!
You break a fella's nose, Murdoch.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.518
You don't nearly tear a man's head
right off and hang him in a tree.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.672
Yes. Somewhat of a stretch,
as you might say, sir.

10:43.960 --> 10:47.191
If Joseph Fryer had been involved
in illegal prize fighting,

10:47.280 --> 10:50.272
perhaps he was also active
in other unsavoury endeavours.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.588
Sirs, pardon the interruption.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.749
Yes, George.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.034
We have another body off Lennox Street.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.231
It's certainly connected to
the Joseph Fryer case.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.198
Sir, this can't be
a coincidence.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.790
This is Corporal Ned Young, George.
I interviewed him this morning.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.959
Knife wound to the spine.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.073
His jaw appears to be broken.
Post-mortem, I'd suspect.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.514
What could it all mean, sir?

11:20.560 --> 11:24.519
Is the question what do Corporals
Young and Fryer have in common?

11:25.360 --> 11:28.511
They resided in the same barracks
and were part of the same squad.

11:28.760 --> 11:32.309
A squad that, for some unknown reason,
has become someone's target of choice.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.310
Fryer. And now Young.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.473
They were like blood brothers.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.553
I'm terribly sorry, Major Cole.

11:51.040 --> 11:54.510
If I may, what was Corporal Young
doing away from the Armoury today?

11:55.600 --> 11:57.795
He was upset over
Corporal Fryer's death.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.278
I gave him leave for the afternoon
to contend with his grief.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.908
Of course.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.190
May I have a duplicate of
your squad's service records?

12:05.720 --> 12:07.631
Of course, Detective, whatever you need.

12:07.800 --> 12:08.949
Thank you.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.275
Are you at all familiar
with a man named Laughton?

12:12.520 --> 12:13.873
Laughton?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.628
I don't believe so.

12:15.880 --> 12:19.793
I see. Major, I strongly suggest
you put the rest of your squad on alert

12:19.880 --> 12:21.472
and possibly even confine them.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.160
I've already issued that alert,
as per Major Cole's orders.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.669
Please forgive my incomplete
knowledge of military standings,

12:28.920 --> 12:31.309
but doesn't Colonel outrank Major?

12:31.400 --> 12:33.789
Major Cole
is an honoured British advisor,

12:33.880 --> 12:37.668
a veteran of the Transvaal Boer War
and the battle of Tel-el-Kebir in Egypt.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.675
His experience is invaluable
to the training of our men.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.669
And we are most grateful.

12:42.760 --> 12:43.954
Mm-hmm.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.473
Very well. Thank you, gentlemen.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.590
That Colonel Heywood
seems quite the horse's a...

12:51.680 --> 12:52.795
Thank you, George.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.431
Once Major Cole
supplies the information,

12:55.520 --> 12:58.671
please look into the civilian background
of every soldier in his squad.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.034
Yes, sir. Will do.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.797
Two dead
soldiers from the same squad.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.639
Any theories, Murdoch?

13:10.240 --> 13:11.514
Past indiscretions, perhaps?

13:12.560 --> 13:16.030
Both Corporals Young and Fryer
had previous criminal backgrounds.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.395
Receiving stolen goods, selling stolen
goods, as well as assault convictions.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.077
In fact, of the seven men
in Major Cole's squad,

13:24.160 --> 13:25.991
five of them had criminal backgrounds.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.552
Back in '79, most every
man in my Afghan contingent

13:29.640 --> 13:32.757
had been thieves or vagabonds
at some point.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.958
The army's the last bastion for some.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.235
And you, sir?

13:36.360 --> 13:39.397
Well, I made it into the constabulary,
didn't I?

13:40.040 --> 13:42.918
Yes, I'm well aware of the
thorough screening process.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.149
Excuse me, sirs.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.435
What have you, George?

13:45.920 --> 13:47.638
An interesting turn, I would say.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.557
I looked into Joseph Fryer's estate.

13:49.720 --> 13:53.190
I found that he and Corporal Young
and the other members of the squad,

13:53.480 --> 13:57.712
are engaged in a binding legal pact
payable upon their deaths.

13:57.800 --> 13:58.915
You mean a tontine.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.149
Yes, exactly, sir.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.110
A tontine is a kind of
group insurance policy.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.556
Everyone pays in. Last surviving member
inherits the whole kit and caboodle.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.520
Well, then, perhaps one of
the soldiers in this tontine

14:10.600 --> 14:12.556
is trying to cash in prematurely.

14:15.760 --> 14:16.829
Corporal Tennant,

14:16.920 --> 14:21.789
I understand your squad entered into
a tontine agreement three months ago.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.719
Yes, sir. We hired a lawyer
to make it fair and legal.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.913
And what inspired you to
enter into this agreement?

14:29.960 --> 14:31.313
Inspired?

14:31.400 --> 14:33.868
We don't need inspiration,
we're combat soldiers.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.869
But your squad hadn't seen combat

14:36.960 --> 14:39.394
prior to entering into the tontine,
and still hasn't.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.793
To my knowledge, Canada
has yet to engage in any war.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.033
War is brewing everywhere,
pretty well all the time, sir.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.512
We stand ready to defend
the British Empire.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.751
That means we could be into it tomorrow.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.518
Are you feeling anxious, Corporal?

14:58.080 --> 15:01.755
Yes, sir. A bit on edge is
understandable, given these murders.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.114
Indeed.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.030
I'll need to see a copy of
this tontine agreement.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.869
That is, unless, of course,
you have any objections?

15:10.880 --> 15:12.279
None that I can think of.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.234
Matthew Larson.

15:35.800 --> 15:40.112
He was full of curses for
a man named Laughton, I believe.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.717
Good work today, men.
Now you're looking like soldiers.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.314
Squad, dismissed!

15:58.160 --> 15:59.434
Thank you, Tom.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.436
Detective Murdoch, have you made
any progress with your investigation?

16:07.320 --> 16:10.915
Why did you leave Corporal Matthew
Larson's name off of your squad list?

16:11.400 --> 16:12.594
Well, it's quite simple, Detective.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.310
You requested a list of
the men under my command.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.515
Mr Larson was discharged long ago.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.074
And why was he discharged?

16:21.800 --> 16:23.791
I'm instructing the men
in anti-guerrilla warfare.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.918
A Dutch concept known as "kommando. "

16:26.560 --> 16:29.438
Light infantry,
with emphasis on reconnaissance,

16:29.520 --> 16:31.431
camouflage and marksmanship.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.274
The nature of war is changing,
Detective. Our soldiers must adapt.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.314
Mr Larson wasn't up to the challenge.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.759
I see. Where might I find him now?

16:42.720 --> 16:46.349
His exact whereabouts, I'm not sure.
But I do know he was a local boy.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.793
Mr Larson, please,
help me find your son.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.555
It could be he had
nothing to do with this.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.119
But if he did,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.197
I need to find him and stop him
before any more harm can be done.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.319
You know, Matthew was a good farm boy,

17:08.440 --> 17:09.839
but not soldier material.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.472
Not enough self control, discipline.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.433
Do you have a photograph of him?

17:17.160 --> 17:19.549
Yes, yes.
It's right in that drawer there.

17:21.480 --> 17:24.040
That'd be him in the back there,
second from the right.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.232
These are Baobab trees.

17:29.320 --> 17:34.838
Yes. It was taken four or five months
ago on a training mission to Africa.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.353
He said he was going to go out there,
prove he could handle himself.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.349
Of course, he couldn't.

17:41.160 --> 17:45.233
I suppose when you don't live up to
your own expectations, it take its toll.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.753
When he come back, he was all...
He was all hot-tempered,

17:51.240 --> 17:52.719
and haunted, I suppose you'd say.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.199
Haunted? How do you mean?

17:55.800 --> 17:57.597
The boy went out there,
he was full of pride.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.913
Comes back, just hating himself.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.270
You know, I should've held on
to the family farm.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.272
It would have been something
for Matthew to settle down on.

18:11.480 --> 18:12.833
But I didn't, so...

18:14.000 --> 18:17.117
Well, now that old farmhouse
is just ruined.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.710
It's sitting out there
at the edge of the city.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.550
Higgins, Guthrie, this way.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.149
George.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.553
Is that Larson?

18:56.080 --> 18:57.229
Corporal Tennant.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.479
Keep your eyes open, George.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.428
Stop!

19:16.880 --> 19:18.313
Right there! Right there!

19:19.240 --> 19:20.559
No, George!

19:22.560 --> 19:24.312
Fan out along the tree line!
I want him alive!

19:24.400 --> 19:25.594
Yes sir! Right away sir!
Go! Go!

20:08.920 --> 20:12.708
And then, like a jack-in-the-box
from hell, out pops Larson,

20:13.120 --> 20:14.189
screaming bloody murder.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.590
Face, sickly, covered in lesions like...

20:18.240 --> 20:20.310
Like the sixth plague of Egypt.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.675
I beg your pardon?

20:21.800 --> 20:24.872
The sixth plague of Egypt. I've been
researching it for my murder mystery.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.514
The plague of boils.

20:26.720 --> 20:30.508
That's what Larson's face was like.
A terrible condition. Very contagious.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.359
In fact...

20:35.120 --> 20:39.238
The constable's somewhat dramatic
account is essentially accurate.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.392
Larson seemed crazed
and very much in ill health.

20:42.720 --> 20:46.599
lll health, but still fit enough to kill
Corporal Tennant to make his escape.

20:47.360 --> 20:51.956
True, sir, but one puzzling thing.
He broke off the attack, sir.

20:52.160 --> 20:56.119
He looked right at me,
and then suddenly seemed surprised.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.910
I got the impression that he initially
thought I was someone else.

21:00.480 --> 21:04.268
So he's crazed, but not crazy enough
to kill just anyone. Except soldiers.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.752
Sir, may I suggest we post men
at his father's house,

21:07.840 --> 21:10.559
in case Larson seeks refuge there?

21:12.760 --> 21:14.079
George?

21:14.480 --> 21:15.595
Sir, I'll see to it.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.829
Thank you.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.508
Higgins?

21:19.600 --> 21:20.749
And what about the military?

21:20.880 --> 21:22.393
A lot of good they've done
in all this mess.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.871
Well, sir,
Major Cole has been cooperative,

21:24.960 --> 21:28.191
but, as I'm finding out,not particularly
forthcoming with details.

21:28.960 --> 21:32.669
For starters, what the hell was Corporal
Tennant doing at the Larsen farm?

21:33.440 --> 21:36.034
Corporal Tennant
disobeyed a direct order.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.395
The squad was confined
to the Armoury last night,

21:41.120 --> 21:44.954
but it seems Corporal Tennant decided
to take matters into his own hands.

21:45.960 --> 21:49.919
Perhaps the men in your squad aren't
"all for one," as you thought.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.228
Now why would that be?

21:53.120 --> 21:56.510
All I know is, I've lost another man.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.956
And Larson is free to kill again.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.630
Are you sure it's not time to allow
the military

22:02.720 --> 22:04.790
to assume control of the investigation?

22:04.880 --> 22:06.199
I'm quite sure.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.714
And if it were your men
dropping like flies?

22:10.040 --> 22:12.600
I will bring Larson to justice,
you can rest assured of that.

22:13.720 --> 22:14.994
As you wish.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.229
Larson was visibly ill
when I encountered him.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.789
He seemed crazed.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.833
There's something
you should see, Detective.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.428
What are they suffering from?

22:38.720 --> 22:40.915
Dr Henderson
hasn't determined that yet.

22:42.320 --> 22:46.029
Perhaps it's some foreign disease,
something they contracted in Africa.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.759
Pardon me, Detective?

22:49.160 --> 22:51.435
Major, I've seen photographic proof

22:51.520 --> 22:55.593
that Matthew Larson and other soldiers
under your command spent time in Africa.

22:56.240 --> 22:59.630
Now, if you would prefer that I discuss
this with Colonel Heywood...

22:59.720 --> 23:01.358
He knows full well my men
were in Africa.

23:01.760 --> 23:05.469
But I ask that you not speak of this
to anyone outside of the Armoury.

23:05.560 --> 23:07.278
Those details are restricted.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.671
Your men were on training
manoeuvres in Africa.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.630
Four months ago. In February.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.876
For a three-week period
in the Transvaal region.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.354
A political powder keg.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.394
From what I understand,
another potential Boer War.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.868
I hope not.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.278
But, as I said, my escort were
there for training purposes.

23:25.920 --> 23:31.756
And, with the exception of Mr Larson,
my team performed remarkably well.

23:32.440 --> 23:36.035
Well, again I ask you, sir,
what are they suffering from?

23:37.120 --> 23:38.678
African trypanosomiasis.

23:39.320 --> 23:40.799
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

23:41.360 --> 23:43.157
African trypanosomiasis,

23:43.240 --> 23:46.630
or, to the common man,
sleeping sickness.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.274
There was an outbreak in the Congo
about two years ago.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.477
Since then, thousands have died
throughout the Dark Continent.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.518
The disease is spread by
the bite of the tsetse fly.

23:55.760 --> 24:00.072
What are the chances of several soldiers
in the same squad getting this disease?

24:00.160 --> 24:02.310
Very good, actually,
if they were all in Africa.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.713
Is that everything?

24:05.840 --> 24:07.592
No. Doctor, might you enlighten me

24:07.680 --> 24:10.558
with the common symptoms
of this sleeping sickness?

24:10.760 --> 24:13.228
Well, fever, headache, death.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.111
Now that's a symptom y
ou don't want to ignore.

24:18.360 --> 24:19.395
Thank you, Doctor.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.118
Oh, pleasure.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.149
Oh, just a second, Murdoch.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.399
Let's have a look.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.995
Phlebitis, torticollis...

24:34.760 --> 24:37.479
Trypanosomiasis, here we are. African...

24:37.560 --> 24:41.917
Symptoms are swollen lymph nodes,
joint pain, itchiness, confusion.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.795
If left untreated, neurological damage,
dementia and death.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.439
Let's not forget about death.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.709
Yes, death.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.434
Nothing about crazed aggression,
facial lesions...

24:52.880 --> 24:55.678
No. Nothing about that.

24:56.600 --> 25:00.912
Wait a minute. When did you say the men
returned from their African campaign?

25:01.360 --> 25:03.078
Several months ago.

25:03.680 --> 25:06.911
But the entire life cycle of
this disease is three weeks.

25:08.320 --> 25:12.154
Then it's impossible the soldiers I saw
are afflicted with this disease.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.432
Something else must be at play.

25:14.760 --> 25:18.594
You know, it's just stunning
this detecting mind of yours.

25:19.720 --> 25:20.835
Sir?

25:21.200 --> 25:22.474
What the hell do you want?

25:23.120 --> 25:25.350
Sir, we have a problem
at the Larson residence.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.629
What the bloody hell
is this all about?

25:28.840 --> 25:30.637
Inspector Brackenreid, Colonel Heywood.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.915
I'm posting these men with orders
to place Matthew Larson

25:33.000 --> 25:34.638
under military arrest on sight.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.757
Are you now, Colonel? Funny, that.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.478
Because wherever Mr Larson is captured,

25:38.560 --> 25:41.233
he's to be taken into the custody
of the Toronto Constabulary.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.873
Under the terms of confederation,

25:42.960 --> 25:45.474
the Canadian military has a right
to assume control of...

25:45.560 --> 25:47.391
You're
not listening to me, sunshine.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.509
The second you step out of the Armoury,
you lose all jurisdictional control.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.632
And I'll read you the Federal Militia
Act, if I bloody well have to.

25:56.120 --> 25:59.317
I don't want anyone lurking around
here waiting to shoot my son!

25:59.400 --> 26:00.992
That's not going to happen, Mr Larson.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.953
Gentlemen, may I suggest a compromise?

26:06.480 --> 26:09.233
Constable Higgins will remain here,
as well as one of your soldiers.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.713
Equal representation for both sides.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.073
Best accept it, Colonel.

26:13.320 --> 26:16.312
I'd rather not arrest you
for obstructing a police investigation.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.719
You're to report in each hour.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.473
And you, Higgins, every half hour.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.959
Excuse me, Inspector.

26:26.840 --> 26:31.072
Wesley. Right, fun's over. What's next?

26:31.680 --> 26:33.910
Sir, I'm going to return
to the infirmary.

26:34.080 --> 26:37.436
Either Dr Henderson has
misdiagnosed what's ailing these men

26:37.520 --> 26:40.432
or there is a concerted effort
to keep us from the truth.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.438
Very good, Murdoch.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.832
I think it's time you considered
wearing spectacles, Detective.

26:54.360 --> 26:58.239
Forgive me, Doctor. I'm merely checking
in on the condition of your patients.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.192
They're under quarantine.
You'll have to leave.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.718
They have an infectious disease!

27:02.800 --> 27:05.598
Then perhaps you should consider
wearing a mask, Dr Henderson.

27:10.920 --> 27:15.198
Sorry to disturb you, soldier. I wonder
if I could ask you a few questions.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.554
Yeah.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.436
Why has Matthew Larson
turned against your unit?

27:24.360 --> 27:26.316
Can you tell me why he was discharged?

27:28.120 --> 27:30.076
Larson discharged himself.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.117
He wasn't up for it. He couldn't cope.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.951
Does it have to do with
the training in Africa?

27:36.360 --> 27:37.509
Yeah.

27:37.600 --> 27:38.919
What happened in Africa?

27:40.000 --> 27:41.228
Detective Murdoch,

27:41.960 --> 27:43.518
you will leave the premises immediately.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.157
Of your own accord, or by force.

27:48.480 --> 27:51.756
Thank you for your time, Corporal.
I hope you have a speedy recovery.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.633
I've completed a post-mortem
analysis of all three soldiers.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.393
Curiously, each of them
suffered kidney damage,

28:12.720 --> 28:14.312
but I've been unable to find a cause.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.237
It's not like anything I've seen before.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.868
And we know they weren't suffering
from sleeping sickness.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.558
And the same can be said for
the soldiers in the army's infirmary.

28:22.680 --> 28:26.229
Well, but they could be ill with some
unknown infectious disease.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.795
You could have raised
that point earlier, Doctor.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.639
Yes, I suppose I could have.

28:32.360 --> 28:36.148
Now, you might want to take note of
Corporal Young here.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.717
I had assumed his injuries
were from the beating

28:39.800 --> 28:41.392
but if I just

28:41.480 --> 28:43.198
peel this

28:43.360 --> 28:44.429
back here,

28:44.520 --> 28:49.150
you can see a portion of his liver has
been compressed through the upper ribs.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.752
Now that is consistent with
a fall from some height.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.749
Fall?

28:55.640 --> 28:58.791
Yes. I'm all but certain
that's what I just said.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.716
This is where Corporal Young's body
was found.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.238
The impact was on the front,
right side of his body,

29:11.360 --> 29:15.069
meaning he fell forward from...

29:24.440 --> 29:27.477
Sir, looks like Corporal Young had
something of a sniper's nest made up.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.199
I wonder what he was hoping to shoot.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.635
George,

29:36.600 --> 29:40.434
I believe Corporal Larson was not
the hunter, but the hunted.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.951
I don't know about that, sir,
we have three dead soldiers.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.158
Yes, but perhaps he knew
they were tracking him

29:47.440 --> 29:48.668
and got to them first.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.072
You think there were trying
to kill one of their own.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.350
Why would they do that?
And why would Young set up here?

29:54.440 --> 29:57.398
And how'd he know that Larson would
be anywhere near this area of town?

29:59.480 --> 30:00.708
I don't know, George.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.158
Obviously forced entry, sir.

30:18.640 --> 30:19.959
Larson, perhaps?

30:20.040 --> 30:22.600
Shh.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.718
Dr Henderson, good afternoon.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.996
I'd say it's time you answered
a few questions.

30:46.920 --> 30:50.515
Dr Henderson,
what's the purpose of this laboratory?

30:51.400 --> 30:54.312
I use it to store supplies
and run medical tests.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.477
There's no room for a proper
laboratory at the Armoury.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.035
Proper, Doctor? This place
seems to be in shambles.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.357
Uh, yes. I was just straightening up so
I could resume my attempt to find a cure

31:04.440 --> 31:06.590
for whatever disease
is afflicting our soldiers.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.755
But you've already diagnosed
it as sleeping sickness.

31:11.480 --> 31:14.199
That was a preliminary diagnosis.
I wanted to be sure.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.790
Doctor, we both know that
none of what you're telling me is true.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.951
Believe what you like, Detective.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.999
Matthew Larson broke in here yesterday
and caused all of this mess, didn't he?

31:28.760 --> 31:30.512
Now, what was he looking for?

31:31.120 --> 31:33.350
I heard you told the major,
Larson is very ill.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.792
Larson knows where
my laboratory is located,

31:35.960 --> 31:37.951
so I assume he was looking
for a cure for his illness,

31:38.480 --> 31:39.629
whatever that may be.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.597
If I may say, sir, it seemed
that you were in quite the hurry

31:41.680 --> 31:43.079
to pack up the place just now.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.354
Am I free to go?

31:45.360 --> 31:48.670
You, sir, are free to come down to the
station house for further questioning.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.069
He seems to be creating some
sort of medicinal compound.

32:05.280 --> 32:09.034
It's just, there's something so familiar
about these materials.

32:09.120 --> 32:14.069
You know, the diluted acids, synthesized
alkaloids and this dried ephedra plant.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.678
Ephedra! Ephedra...

32:17.840 --> 32:20.115
Ephedra, ephredrine?

32:21.520 --> 32:24.239
I read an article about
a Japanese chemist in Tokyo...

32:24.320 --> 32:25.833
Nagayoshi Nagai?

32:26.320 --> 32:27.435
Yes.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.589
Well, in 1893, he used the ephedra plant
to produce ephedrine.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.831
He synthesized that into
what he dubbed "methamphetamines,"

32:35.280 --> 32:38.192
a potent stimulant, heightening
alertness, energy and aggression,

32:38.360 --> 32:42.672
noted side effects
are memory loss, seizures

32:42.760 --> 32:44.239
and kidney damage.

32:46.160 --> 32:48.469
And would you say that if
taken in high enough doses

32:48.560 --> 32:51.677
this methamphetamine could
cause deranged behaviour?

32:51.840 --> 32:53.114
And skin lesions?

32:53.640 --> 32:55.278
Deranged behaviour, certainly.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.073
Although, you know, I've heard that

32:57.160 --> 33:00.038
laboratory animals given long-term
doses of stimulants

33:00.120 --> 33:02.680
do begin to pick and tear at their skin.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.111
And were these skin tears
to become infected,

33:05.200 --> 33:07.998
they would have the appearance
of sores and lesions.

33:09.840 --> 33:12.991
I believe we're on to Dr Henderson's
dirty little deeds.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.315
Yes. Each soldier
under Major Cole's command

33:16.400 --> 33:18.231
was injected with methamphetamine.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.799
I prescribed a conservative daily dosage
which proved quite successful.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.032
Alertness and stamina
increased dramatically.

33:24.520 --> 33:27.353
Until you discovered the side effects,
is that correct?

33:27.480 --> 33:29.789
I'll confess the drug
creates strong dependency.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.197
Which would explain why Matthew Larson
broke into your laboratory.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.352
He was desperate
for more methamphetamine.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.072
There wasn't much there,
but he did find some.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.712
Detective, believe me,
once I established

33:41.880 --> 33:43.598
Mr Larson was reacting
negatively to his treatment,

33:43.680 --> 33:46.558
the military acted responsibly
and terminated the project.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.594
Who gave that order?

33:49.200 --> 33:50.349
Major Cole.

33:51.520 --> 33:55.433
So, the soldiers aren't
suffering from some infectious disease.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.473
They're going through withdrawal.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.316
Psychomotor stimulant
withdrawal, to be precise.

34:01.480 --> 34:02.913
Yes, let's be precise.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.395
Just when did you begin to
administer methamphetamine?

34:06.000 --> 34:07.797
Was it before or after Africa?

34:08.480 --> 34:10.152
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.518
It doesn't make sense to me.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.918
Why give soldiers drugs
and risk impairing their judgment?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.433
My time in Afghanistan

34:22.520 --> 34:25.512
taught me that fighting spirit
was near the bottom of a bottle.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.434
Alcohol could ease the anxiety of
charging into a hail of bullets.

34:29.520 --> 34:32.830
But it would be far better to heighten
senses, not dampen them.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.434
Methamphetamine could be very
beneficial on the battlefield.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.197
Depending on the battle, a touch
of memory loss might not hurt either.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.472
Yes, well, use of the drug
could play a major role

34:41.560 --> 34:43.949
in the future of warfare,
for better or for worse.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.237
Nevertheless, I want this Major Cole
brought in to explain himself.

34:47.320 --> 34:48.389
Of course, sir.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.311
And what about our fugitive Mr Larson?

34:50.400 --> 34:52.469
Running around somewhere,
mad on methamphetamine.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.710
Anyone who comes near him
could be his next victim.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.074
I don't think so, sir.

34:56.159 --> 34:59.357
Larson could have killed me,
but he stopped himself.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.952
And though I believe
the use of methamphetamine

35:02.040 --> 35:03.837
resulted in the highly aggressive
murders

35:03.920 --> 35:05.751
I don't think that's the whole story.

35:06.280 --> 35:07.429
How so?

35:07.880 --> 35:12.351
George, go to the archives and research
any articles written on South Africa,

35:12.440 --> 35:16.956
British and Canadian newspapers,
written in the last five months or so.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.634
Yes, sir.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.433
What are you thinking, Murdoch?

35:21.800 --> 35:26.078
Well, sir, the men in Cole's squad
pursued Larson with murderous intent.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.194
I believe, as a result of something
that happened in Africa.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.555
Something that caused his comrades
to turn against him.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.878
And before I meet with Major Cole again,
I want to know what that was.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.434
"British family
slaughtered in Carletonville. "

35:41.800 --> 35:45.236
"In the dead of night,
four militia set the houses aflame

35:45.360 --> 35:48.318
"and shot down anyone
who tried to escape the inferno.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.868
"No one was spared,
including women and children. "

35:50.960 --> 35:52.439
Well, sir, listen to this.

35:52.600 --> 35:56.309
"A Boer militia camp was wiped out
with 'military precision. '

35:57.360 --> 35:59.351
"British High Command denies
any of their combat troops

35:59.440 --> 36:01.158
"were within 200 miles of the incident. "

36:02.160 --> 36:07.109
Five days after the British families
were slaughtered in Carletonville.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.628
Unofficial retaliation, perhaps?

36:11.040 --> 36:12.712
Major Cole's squad.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.640
It's possible, George.
They were training in the area.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.354
And these killings are also
exceptionally brutal.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.033
What is it now, Detective?

36:26.160 --> 36:30.950
Major Cole, why did you not discharge
Corporal Larson sooner than you did?

36:31.760 --> 36:34.593
Clearly he wasn't coping with
his dosage of methamphetamine.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.598
Oh, yes. I know about the drug.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.312
Corporal Larson became a liability.

36:42.640 --> 36:46.269
And perhaps I'll have to accept
the theoretical responsibility for that.

36:46.720 --> 36:50.633
However, all military trials with
methamphetamine have been cancelled.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.439
Major, am I to assume
that your experiments

36:54.560 --> 36:56.551
with these drugs are news
to Colonel Heywood?

37:00.040 --> 37:01.359
No, Detective.

37:02.160 --> 37:05.391
The Canadian military is in full support
of our British joint operations.

37:07.320 --> 37:11.632
Hmm. So, you're aware that Corporal
Larson's dependency on methamphetamine

37:11.720 --> 37:14.871
is directly related to the training
missions in South Africa?

37:15.160 --> 37:16.832
Detective Murdoch, you are reaching!

37:17.640 --> 37:21.553
And this is why your men
were on methamphetamine.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.796
Inciting them to savagely kill
Boer militia without question.

37:26.400 --> 37:29.392
Yes, it's true your men were on
a training mission in South Africa.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.311
But you took advantage
of the opportunity

37:31.640 --> 37:35.076
to launch an attack on Boer militia
at Krugersdorp.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.679
Such is war.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.876
But we're not at war in South Africa.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.434
Don't be naive!

37:41.520 --> 37:44.353
You don't need an official declaration
of war to be engaged in one!

37:45.040 --> 37:46.758
The Dutch provoked all of this.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.108
So you admit that the massacre
at Krugersdorp

37:50.200 --> 37:52.714
was retaliation for the events
at Carletonville.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.633
What would you have us do, hmm?

37:55.360 --> 37:59.592
Stand idle while British innocents are
murdered and have no response?

38:02.160 --> 38:03.957
I'm done here, Detective Murdoch.

38:05.080 --> 38:09.039
Matters of the nation and the crown
are beyond you.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.313
Sir, I think we have a situation.

38:22.520 --> 38:26.274
Higgins telephoned from the Larson
residence... I think it was Higgins.

38:26.480 --> 38:27.879
Clarify yourself, George.

38:27.960 --> 38:31.077
Well, sir, he only spoke a few words
but he said something about "he's here,"

38:31.160 --> 38:33.628
and then the line went dead.
I called back several times...

38:41.080 --> 38:42.433
Come.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.958
Constable Higgins?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.036
George!

39:07.160 --> 39:08.752
Higgins! What happened?

39:08.840 --> 39:11.513
Aah, I was hit from behind.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.352
I heard Larson upstairs.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.870
Detective? Detective!

39:17.240 --> 39:20.391
Matthew came home!
He charged through the front door there

39:20.840 --> 39:24.230
and struck these two poor men,
then he just ran off!

39:25.160 --> 39:31.713
These men were hit from behind,
taken by surprise, I suspect by you.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.553
And I think I know why.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.874
Matthew was here this afternoon
when we were all here, wasn't he?

39:41.200 --> 39:43.077
Please, Detective,
just leave him be, I beg you...

39:43.160 --> 39:44.513
Step aside, Mr Larson.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.239
Please, just leave him be!

40:01.680 --> 40:04.148
The fire, they were burning.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.599
Screaming.

40:51.400 --> 40:52.992
Calm, gentlemen, we have him.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.716
A guard failed to report in
and now I see why.

40:55.960 --> 40:57.075
Stand aside, Detective.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.673
We're taking Larson into custody!

40:58.760 --> 41:00.239
I won't allow that, Colonel.

41:01.120 --> 41:04.430
Especially now that I know
the full extent of Major Cole's tactics.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.397
There were children!

41:06.480 --> 41:07.708
Burning!

41:08.360 --> 41:09.793
Stand aside, Murdoch!

41:10.160 --> 41:12.754
Not only are you guilty
of the killings in Krugersdorp,

41:13.200 --> 41:14.519
but you ordered your squad

41:14.600 --> 41:17.512
to kill innocent British men,
women and children in Carletonville.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.715
I said, "Move!"

41:18.800 --> 41:19.949
Major!

41:22.560 --> 41:26.155
You sacrificed innocent women
and children to bring on war.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.310
To give the British licence
to attack the Boers!

41:28.400 --> 41:30.152
Surely, you must be mistaken.

41:30.880 --> 41:35.078
Corporal Larson,
what happened in Africa?

41:39.480 --> 41:40.913
We killed our own!

41:43.960 --> 41:45.393
Is this true, Major?

41:46.520 --> 41:47.919
What did you tell the men?

41:48.680 --> 41:50.955
Did they know they were
murdering British civilians?

41:51.800 --> 41:53.028
Did you tell them?

41:54.600 --> 41:56.556
Yes, I told them.

41:57.520 --> 42:00.432
But only after my orders
were carried out.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.549
Which is why your men obeyed
your orders to hunt down Mr Larson.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.639
You and your squad couldn't risk
Larson exposing the truth

42:07.720 --> 42:09.517
about your mission in Africa.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.311
Those were once my men,

42:12.920 --> 42:14.717
good soldiers.

42:15.280 --> 42:16.952
You've turned them into murderers.

42:17.680 --> 42:19.272
Colonel Heywood, please.

42:19.760 --> 42:25.153
You colonials, you don't understand
what it takes to preserve an empire!

42:26.560 --> 42:29.028
And the privileged lives you all lead,

42:29.760 --> 42:32.672
they don't come without cost.

42:33.480 --> 42:34.913
Or sacrifice.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.592
Damn your blood.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.671
Colonel, no! No.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.194
Major Cole will face justice

42:43.240 --> 42:47.028
in a military court, in front of
his peers, with you as a witness.

43:05.160 --> 43:08.914
Sir, according to the doctors
at Toronto General Hospital,

43:09.000 --> 43:10.911
Major Cole will survive.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.433
A telegram.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.073
From the British Secretary of State
for War

43:14.160 --> 43:16.720
claiming that Major Cole
and his squad had gone rogue.

43:16.960 --> 43:20.350
And that the Brits deny any involvement
in these unfortunate affairs.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.512
Surely they don't expect us
to believe...

43:22.680 --> 43:24.193
It's all bollocks!

43:24.360 --> 43:27.591
That bastard Cole will merely slink off
with a dishonourable discharge

43:28.040 --> 43:30.076
and probably a pension to go with it!

43:31.400 --> 43:34.312
You know what happened to me
the first time I saw combat, Murdoch?

43:34.400 --> 43:35.992
I fired over the heads of the enemy.

43:36.160 --> 43:38.435
I couldn't bring myself
to shoot another man.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.755
Mind you, the first shots that whistled
past my ears

43:41.840 --> 43:44.229
I tightened up my aim considerably.

43:44.320 --> 43:47.232
Forcing men to kill,
that's the military's biggest battle.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.712
No doubt, Major Cole was aware of that.

43:49.880 --> 43:53.555
He knew that his untested men would
hesitate at killing in cold blood.

43:54.480 --> 43:56.471
Methamphetamine helped them
overcome that.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.553
At the cost of losing their faculties.

43:58.880 --> 44:02.316
When it became obvious that Corporal
Larson couldn't cope with what he'd done

44:02.400 --> 44:05.312
Major Cole panicked and increased
his dose of methamphetamine,

44:05.400 --> 44:08.631
but it turned him into a madman.
A dangerous liability.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.832
What's the prognosis for Larson?

44:11.080 --> 44:13.150
He's been placed in permanent care.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.236
But I'm told the brain damage
is too far along.

44:16.080 --> 44:18.992
Thankfully, the programme that
made him this way is no longer.

44:19.160 --> 44:20.434
Don't kid yourself, Murdoch.

44:20.520 --> 44:22.158
A second Boer War is on the horizon.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.312
It's too profitable to avoid.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.516
And the Canadian military
will do anything

44:26.600 --> 44:28.670
to prove their mettle
alongside the Brits.

44:28.760 --> 44:31.035
Another Cole will be along
to restart the program.

44:31.120 --> 44:32.394
Perhaps so, sir.

44:32.840 --> 44:35.035
And what will become of
Corporal Larson's father?

44:36.200 --> 44:38.634
The old man took revenge
for what they did to his son.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.990
If I was a judge, I'd be thanking him.

44:42.760 --> 44:46.150
But, come the trial, he just might be
in need of a helpful witness.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.235
Yes, sir. He might be at that.
