14:03.833 --> 14:06.063
the extension at the back.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.673
ls that what all this has been about?

14:08.713 --> 14:10.066
Well, why didn't you say?

14:10.113 --> 14:12.786
A few phone calls,
fix that. No problem.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.903
What Yvonne's saying Bernie... Too late.

14:14.953 --> 14:17.945
You crossed the line. We're sick
of having to slip you backhanders

14:17.993 --> 14:21.747
for anything we need doing. People are
sick of you charging for democracy.

14:21.793 --> 14:23.192
Aren't you the noble one?

14:23.233 --> 14:26.111
Noble, be buggered.
Kash gets on planning committee,

14:26.153 --> 14:28.030
he's never going to have to
work another day in his life.

14:28.073 --> 14:30.985
Then we might be able to
afford an apartment in Spain.

14:31.033 --> 14:33.672
We can buy Bernie's
when he's forced to sell up!

14:34.113 --> 14:36.343
Be careful what you wish for.

14:39.273 --> 14:41.229
Congratulations

14:41.433 --> 14:43.583
And jubilations

14:43.633 --> 14:48.104
l want the world to know l'm happy
as can be

14:49.473 --> 14:51.304
Who would believe that l...

14:52.353 --> 14:53.706
..Contented...

14:54.153 --> 14:55.745
(Veronica) What key are you in?

14:55.793 --> 15:00.503
Was in the bad old days before
l met you

15:00.553 --> 15:04.148
When l let you walk into my...

15:05.353 --> 15:06.672
SHE SOBS

15:06.713 --> 15:08.271
What's up, Debs?

15:23.153 --> 15:25.826
You can't blame Fiona.

15:25.873 --> 15:28.182
Steve left her high and dry.

15:28.233 --> 15:32.385
Fine, if that's all he did, but
he's come back to put things right.

15:32.433 --> 15:34.071
Bad timing, sweetheart.

15:34.113 --> 15:38.186
- She's having Craig's baby.
- By accident.

15:38.233 --> 15:40.827
Yeah...

15:40.873 --> 15:44.149
She's made some big decisions
that she can't unpick.

15:44.193 --> 15:51.304
She likes Craig but she loves Steve
more than she'll ever love anybody.

15:51.353 --> 15:56.381
l'm one of the lucky ones but
we can't all have the perfect ending.

15:56.433 --> 15:59.630
Here we go.
They were out of hot chocolate >

15:59.673 --> 16:01.982
so l got mushroom soup and a
bit of grass to calm things down.

16:02.033 --> 16:03.148
Kev!

16:03.193 --> 16:06.503
Well, not for Debs, obviously.

16:09.153 --> 16:12.350
l need to make a phone call.

16:12.393 --> 16:16.386
Get Debs to show you how to
download your music files.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.072
..which is inheritance
tax in a nutshell.

16:19.113 --> 16:22.742
Which twisted shit came up with
that little gem, inheritance tax?

16:22.793 --> 16:25.227
l've made sure my kids won't
be saddled with that kind of torment

16:25.273 --> 16:27.184
once l've gone.

16:27.233 --> 16:28.951
Cash in the policies.

16:28.993 --> 16:32.224
Let them watch you blow the lot why
you've a breath left in your body.

16:32.273 --> 16:36.027
Listen to the lady -
where there's a will, there's a way.

16:36.073 --> 16:38.064
What are you going to leave behind?

16:38.113 --> 16:39.671
A couple of skid marks?

16:39.713 --> 16:41.624
HE CHUCKLES

16:41.673 --> 16:43.629
Couldn't answer a
prayer, you fat cunt.

16:43.673 --> 16:45.903
Eh! He's just paid your drink up.

16:45.953 --> 16:47.466
Me, what for?

16:47.513 --> 16:49.026
Because he's bought us all a double.

16:49.073 --> 16:50.791
He must think we're simple.

16:50.833 --> 16:55.907
He's buying booze. That is not
allowed. Rum and black, please.

16:55.953 --> 16:57.625
Bless you, Bernie.

16:57.673 --> 16:58.947
DOG YELPS

17:00.513 --> 17:03.027
Oh, for f...

17:03.073 --> 17:05.348
< Hello, gorgeous!

17:05.393 --> 17:08.589
ls this the little minx,
you've taken off Lilian's hands?

17:08.633 --> 17:11.943
One stroke of luck in 1 5
years and that's my lot...

17:11.992 --> 17:13.186
ls it?

17:17.032 --> 17:21.390
< You're covering Chatsworth East.
You're in Selina's car.

17:21.433 --> 17:23.901
Let's go, go, go.
Not you.

17:23.953 --> 17:25.146
Why not?

17:25.193 --> 17:26.626
Well, who's going to help me in shop?

17:28.272 --> 17:31.709
Verna! You've left your bloody bag!

17:33.753 --> 17:37.462
< Lilian, are you OK?
What's this lot doing here again?

17:37.513 --> 17:40.425
The postmortem found >
that your Brendan,

17:40.473 --> 17:44.022
he had a bullet in his head.
lt killed him instantly.

17:44.073 --> 17:47.110
You see that's why he never
dodged out of the way of the van.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.302
Ballistics are certain.

17:48.353 --> 17:51.311
That bullet came from the same gun
that was used in a drugs killing last month.

17:51.353 --> 17:54.072
No. Drugs? Brendan?

17:54.113 --> 17:56.673
They found umpteen
Class A drugs in his system.

17:56.713 --> 17:59.307
His death could have been
part of a turf war gang job.

17:59.353 --> 18:02.106
We need you to come down to the
station to clear a few things up. >

18:02.153 --> 18:04.747
lf that's all right, Mrs Tyler?
Yeah?

18:04.793 --> 18:07.182
All right, lads, put her in the van.

18:07.233 --> 18:09.110
Lilian.

18:09.153 --> 18:12.065
Brendan was no druggie.

18:12.113 --> 18:14.946
Look at him for God's sakes.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.791
The postmortem shows he was
using marijuana, amphetamines,

18:17.833 --> 18:21.508
plus solvents and common adhesives.
That face was totally self-inflicted.

18:21.553 --> 18:24.431
You're fitting him up to get
out of paying any compensation,

18:24.473 --> 18:26.225
you devious buggers!

18:26.273 --> 18:30.471
Stan, CCTV shots from the bookies
at the end of Eastern Street.

18:30.513 --> 18:33.550
Five seconds before our van rams in,
Brendan gets a bullet in the head.

18:33.593 --> 18:36.744
Five seconds later, skinhead with
a white bag legs it from the scene.

18:36.793 --> 18:38.624
< Chatsworth school uniform, see?

18:40.713 --> 18:43.022
Probably a drug runner.

18:43.073 --> 18:44.984
Right, come on Stan,

18:45.033 --> 18:48.025
let's round up all the local skinheads -
starting with the school.

18:59.353 --> 19:00.911
There you go.

19:03.753 --> 19:06.984
You're the one with the gob.
Why didn't you try getting elected?

19:07.033 --> 19:10.264
A, l'm the one that runs this
business properly meaning,

19:10.313 --> 19:12.588
B, people generally hate my guts.

19:12.633 --> 19:15.101
Give over. People respect you.

19:15.153 --> 19:17.508
Personally, l couldn't give a shit

19:17.553 --> 19:20.147
but they're going to love
Kash making a name for himself.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.991
They think he's married
to a hard-nosed bitch.

19:23.033 --> 19:25.263
Cherie Blair helped Tony to get elected.

19:25.313 --> 19:27.873
Since when did Kash need
electing to feel wanted?

19:27.913 --> 19:30.711
Since l told him to.
Have you got a problem with that?

19:30.753 --> 19:33.392
Yeah. lf Kash wins, l'm stuck
here doing extra hours for you

19:33.433 --> 19:34.661
just so he can be somewhere else.

19:34.713 --> 19:37.591
And you think l started all
this to keep you two apart?

19:37.633 --> 19:38.622
Well, haven't you?

19:54.633 --> 19:56.305
What are you doing in here?

19:56.353 --> 19:59.311
Looking for drugs, if you must know.

19:59.353 --> 20:02.106
Try asking.

20:02.153 --> 20:04.428
Proper drugs.

20:04.473 --> 20:05.747
Where's Fiona?

20:05.793 --> 20:07.704
She won't have any, she's skint.

20:07.753 --> 20:09.186
No?

20:09.233 --> 20:11.701
Well, what about your Carl?

20:15.353 --> 20:16.752
Have a look at this.

20:19.993 --> 20:21.506
Pass it, pass it. >

20:21.553 --> 20:24.545
THEY CHUCKLE

20:25.033 --> 20:26.432
Help! >

20:32.113 --> 20:33.102
Where's he gone? >

20:33.953 --> 20:34.942
Do you want a cup of coffee, Craig?

20:34.993 --> 20:38.383
No, ta. l think l'll shoot straight
up for a shower. Fiona up there?

20:38.433 --> 20:39.468
l don't know where she is.

20:39.513 --> 20:41.151
She nipped around to Veronica's
to fix the washing machine.

20:41.193 --> 20:43.343
No, she hasn't.

20:44.273 --> 20:46.070
Does she know how?

20:50.193 --> 20:53.390
lt's fine. lt's working.

20:53.433 --> 20:55.105
l promised Steve
l'd try and talk to you.

20:55.153 --> 20:58.350
Don't go taking it out on Debbie.
l agree with her.

20:58.393 --> 21:00.384
What harm can ten minutes do?

21:00.433 --> 21:02.230
You know fucking well what harm it'll do.

21:02.273 --> 21:04.468
No, l don't Fiona, and neither do you.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.869
lf l agreed, if l showed up,

21:07.913 --> 21:10.302
what have l got to tell
him that he'll want to hear?

21:10.353 --> 21:14.107
He probably wants to know whether
you still love him or not.

21:14.153 --> 21:17.350
lf l do... Course l do.

21:17.393 --> 21:20.465
What good's that going to do
when he knows l'm pregnant?

21:20.513 --> 21:23.664
He's not going to want to hear that, is he?

21:26.713 --> 21:29.352
l don't know, sweetheart.

21:29.393 --> 21:31.509
You'd better ask him yourself.

21:34.153 --> 21:35.142
SHE GASPS

21:40.713 --> 21:42.704
l'm... l was...

21:44.433 --> 21:47.470
l really don't know what l'm supposed to say.

21:49.913 --> 21:52.473
DEBBlE MUTTERS
Shit!

21:52.513 --> 21:55.425
Fiona's not late, l'm not late, am l?

21:56.673 --> 21:58.265
Fuck off.

21:58.313 --> 22:01.510
Carl said your washer
wanted seeing to.

22:02.833 --> 22:06.064
That won't work.

22:06.113 --> 22:08.183
(Fiona) Jesus...

22:08.233 --> 22:10.428
- Let's have a look.
- l've got soap powder in my eyes.

22:10.473 --> 22:13.226
Come on, splash.
Have you got any towels, Veronica?

22:13.273 --> 22:15.787
Towels, upstairs.
Stay there Craig, hang on.

22:15.833 --> 22:18.301
Stay there.

22:23.473 --> 22:25.225
< (Steve) l'm not moving.

22:25.273 --> 22:27.104
< (Veronica) Get upstairs.

22:27.153 --> 22:29.667
Veronica, no! All right?

22:39.073 --> 22:43.464
OK, just blame me and l'm not saying that...

22:45.433 --> 22:49.142
l asked him round here not her.

22:57.513 --> 23:00.311
Can you come up here a sec, Carl?

23:00.353 --> 23:01.342
What for?

23:01.393 --> 23:02.792
Talk about Tuesday night.

23:04.353 --> 23:08.471
You little prick! What have you
done? What have you gone and done?

23:08.513 --> 23:10.469
Get off me!

23:12.193 --> 23:14.423
Lay off him, Debs, he's in bigger trouble. >

23:14.473 --> 23:15.030
Get off!

23:15.073 --> 23:17.462
l shot him. Brendan.

23:17.513 --> 23:19.424
lt was me, all right?

23:20.673 --> 23:23.062
What did he say?

23:23.113 --> 23:26.583
l didn't mean to kill anybody, l swear.

23:46.753 --> 23:49.586
(Craig) l need a straight answer, Fiona.

23:49.633 --> 23:53.228
ls that my baby?

23:53.273 --> 23:55.468
(Steve) Don't answer that.

23:55.513 --> 23:59.142
- Ask him if that matters.
- What?

23:59.193 --> 24:04.347
Look, l came here for you,
whatever that meant,

24:04.393 --> 24:07.305
and l've had a hell
of a lot that l didn't bank on.

24:07.353 --> 24:12.381
But l'm still here, so what does that mean?

24:12.433 --> 24:16.585
Shut your fucking mouth before l do a lot
of people a favour and take you out.

24:16.633 --> 24:18.544
Back of a long queue, action man.

24:18.593 --> 24:20.072
Whoa!

24:20.113 --> 24:23.389
lf all he wants to know is if it's his baby,

24:23.433 --> 24:26.425
then what's the question?
What's his question?

24:26.473 --> 24:27.508
(Craig) Fuck off.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.066
Craig!

24:33.313 --> 24:35.110
Oh, my God.

24:35.153 --> 24:37.462
Craig, can you hear me?

24:37.513 --> 24:40.266
- Look, let me see.
- You need to fuck off.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.908
(Veronica) lf the police find you here,
we're all dead.

24:43.953 --> 24:45.432
Watch yourself.

24:45.473 --> 24:48.783
Oh, my God.
What have we done? Oh, my God.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.149
Hey, sweetheart, it's OK.

24:55.193 --> 24:56.592
Yeah, ambulance.

24:58.553 --> 25:02.387
< Hiya. 6 Swansea Gardens,
Chatsworth Estate.

25:02.433 --> 25:04.549
Please, Fiona.

25:06.473 --> 25:08.828
l can't live without you.

25:12.193 --> 25:13.182
Why me?

25:13.233 --> 25:15.224
He needs someone with him.

25:15.273 --> 25:16.547
But l didn't see what happened.

25:16.593 --> 25:20.711
He banged his fucking head,
what more do they need to know?

25:22.313 --> 25:24.543
Yeah, yeah.

25:25.033 --> 25:27.069
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...

25:27.113 --> 25:30.344
Go on! Come on, that's it.

25:33.953 --> 25:37.502
Yes. Yes. Come on, come here.

25:38.193 --> 25:40.070
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

25:41.513 --> 25:45.108
DOG WHlNES,
CRASH

25:45.153 --> 25:49.704
Oh, l'm having flashbacks
to Jack Brabham here, nightmare.

25:50.753 --> 25:52.345
Debbie!

25:54.273 --> 25:56.264
What now?

25:59.193 --> 26:02.151
No, hang on. Shut up.

26:02.193 --> 26:05.105
l don't want to know.

26:05.153 --> 26:06.552
What?

26:12.513 --> 26:16.711
Cannabis is on prescription,
for Brendan's glaucoma.

26:16.753 --> 26:19.984
He uses the glue
for a bit of fun with the matches.

26:20.033 --> 26:22.308
So, you admit
they sniff glue on match days?

26:22.353 --> 26:24.913
No, the matches.

26:31.193 --> 26:35.584
OK, but that doesn't explain the
amphetamine sulphate also found.

26:35.633 --> 26:39.262
They're mine. l was on them
long before they were popular.

26:39.313 --> 26:42.669
l slipped one in his dinner
when he told jokes l'd heard before.

26:42.713 --> 26:45.273
So, you're getting speed
on the NHS, come off it!

26:45.313 --> 26:46.746
Narcolepsy.

26:46.793 --> 26:50.183
lf l get over-excited, l've a habit of...

26:51.273 --> 26:53.184
THUD

26:55.553 --> 26:57.828
lt is his baby.

26:58.833 --> 27:00.824
No, it isn't.

27:02.833 --> 27:05.427
lt's yours.

27:12.073 --> 27:15.907
Look, if we get married
as soon as we get there,

27:15.953 --> 27:18.421
we're entitled to a two-bedroom flat.

27:18.473 --> 27:22.352
We'll turn over the odd car,
if we're careful. You know,

27:22.393 --> 27:24.543
pay for bills and food and stuff.

27:24.593 --> 27:27.790
You'll have to get
a part-time job, though,

27:27.833 --> 27:30.028
to pay for our drinking habits.

27:30.073 --> 27:31.825
l'm not drinking.

27:31.873 --> 27:34.706
Well, then, we're sorted out.

27:39.593 --> 27:41.948
Even if l could do this to Craig...

27:43.593 --> 27:45.424
..l can't leave my family.

27:45.473 --> 27:48.351
Fiona, we've been here before.

27:48.393 --> 27:53.342
They don't need you
as much as you think they do.

27:53.393 --> 27:56.703
They don't. Just ask them.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.544
l promise you, Fiona,

28:02.593 --> 28:06.108
l'll not let you down again.

28:08.833 --> 28:10.710
l'll make you happy.

28:51.793 --> 28:53.784
SlREN

28:58.033 --> 29:01.230
l don't bake, l can't bake.

29:01.273 --> 29:04.071
You just make it look like you know how to.

29:05.593 --> 29:08.630
You, snap out of it or disappear.

29:08.673 --> 29:10.345
l don't want her to go.

29:10.393 --> 29:13.988
Neither would l,
if l was in as much bother as you.

29:14.033 --> 29:16.422
Tough shit, Carl. Fiona's going.

29:16.473 --> 29:20.466
Say one wrong word before she does,
l'll cut your tongue out, got it?

29:22.393 --> 29:24.224
(Debbie) And that goes for all of you.

29:24.273 --> 29:28.107
lf Fiona finds out about Carl, you're all dead.

29:32.033 --> 29:34.752
Kev's phoned.
Craig's signed himself out.

29:34.793 --> 29:38.502
Seven stitches and he signs himself
out. They're getting a taxi.

29:38.553 --> 29:39.906
l should speak to him.

29:39.953 --> 29:42.865
Don't. You'll fall apart
and change your mind.

29:42.913 --> 29:46.462
- lt's the least he deserves.
- No, it's not. He's second-best.

29:46.513 --> 29:48.185
He's used to getting over stuff like this.

29:48.233 --> 29:50.622
l hope this is the last of them.

29:50.673 --> 29:53.471
We've got Steve
on the back seat, under a blanket.

29:53.513 --> 29:56.027
ALL CHATTER

29:59.393 --> 30:04.513
Like he'll think it's for someone else.
Come on. Will you hurry up!

30:20.673 --> 30:22.629
Hurry, hurry. Move it!

30:29.153 --> 30:31.826
We're all going to be fine.

30:36.153 --> 30:39.623
Look at me. State of me.
l found my baking hands.

30:39.673 --> 30:43.063
l was hoping to send one with you.

30:43.113 --> 30:44.626
Take care of yourself.

30:44.673 --> 30:47.028
We'll need a number,
in case anything goes wrong.

30:48.713 --> 30:50.704
Come here.

31:00.553 --> 31:03.306
Hey. See you, beautiful.

31:03.353 --> 31:04.991
Where are you off to?

31:05.033 --> 31:07.467
Just going on a holiday.
Give my cheek a kiss.

31:07.513 --> 31:09.549
And a cuddle.

31:09.593 --> 31:11.982
(Steve) Fiona! We've got to hurry.

31:15.233 --> 31:17.349
When are those cakes
going to be ready?

31:17.393 --> 31:19.145
lt's no good, l can't leave him.

31:19.193 --> 31:21.388
No, you can.

31:21.433 --> 31:25.312
Dad and Sheila are going to collect him.
He's moving in with them.

31:38.673 --> 31:40.664
ls that true?

31:40.713 --> 31:44.592
Don't be soft.
l won't let him near my dad.

31:50.713 --> 31:51.509
(Steve) Ow.

31:51.553 --> 31:52.747
Sorry.

31:52.793 --> 31:54.829
Yeah, you'd better be. >

31:57.713 --> 31:59.704
Come here, you two.

32:01.633 --> 32:04.306
l love you.

32:06.873 --> 32:08.943
l'll be in touch.

32:11.313 --> 32:13.065
(Steve) l love you.

32:13.113 --> 32:16.150
You'd better, so where am l taking you?

32:16.193 --> 32:19.549
The car's parked in Gilton. See ya!

32:19.593 --> 32:21.549
CAR HORN

32:21.593 --> 32:23.549
See ya!

32:43.673 --> 32:46.631
l got chucked off the bus for swearing.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.267
Fuck you! Twat! Fat bastard!

32:49.313 --> 32:51.110
Started walking home.

32:51.153 --> 32:54.702
'That was when l found it.

32:54.753 --> 32:57.221
'l didn't know what it was at first.'

32:57.273 --> 32:59.992
'lt was lying there in the grass.'

33:02.153 --> 33:05.463
'lt were dead heavy and cold.
l knew it weren't a toy.'

33:14.193 --> 33:17.310
(Debbie) The fact you
had a gun isn't the point, Carl.

33:17.353 --> 33:20.743
Why didn't you tell one of us,
or hand it in somewhere?

33:20.793 --> 33:23.466
l wanted to know what it felt like.

33:23.513 --> 33:26.744
l took it to school. But no-one knew.

33:30.993 --> 33:32.187
HE CHUCKLES

33:33.633 --> 33:36.147
l didn't know it was still loaded.

33:36.193 --> 33:41.142
Until l saw you two
playing footie in Eastern Street.

33:41.193 --> 33:43.912
ALL SHOUT

33:50.713 --> 33:54.023
Hey, Brendan, get your tits out!

33:54.073 --> 33:56.633
SlREN

33:57.713 --> 34:00.989
GUNSHOT
Whoa. Watch it! Shit!

34:02.433 --> 34:04.469
l didn't know it was loaded.

34:07.433 --> 34:09.071
SlREN

34:20.553 --> 34:21.621
Fuck!

34:21.672 --> 34:22.992
lan!

34:23.033 --> 34:25.183
Fuck...ing hell!

34:31.592 --> 34:34.312
Shit! Oh, Christ.

34:38.433 --> 34:40.389
l'm sorry.

34:42.713 --> 34:45.351
Where's the gun now, Carl?

34:47.273 --> 34:49.547
Of course!

34:49.592 --> 34:51.743
Come on!

35:05.713 --> 35:07.829
Somebody take it off me, quick!

35:11.273 --> 35:12.865
(Craig) What's going on?

35:14.473 --> 35:16.464
Where are they?

35:18.833 --> 35:20.949
Where's Steve?

35:20.993 --> 35:23.029
They've gone, Craig.

35:23.073 --> 35:25.462
Fiona's gone.

35:26.913 --> 35:28.665
Fiona!

35:28.713 --> 35:31.864
- Craig.
- He's got the gun!

35:35.913 --> 35:38.381
(Kev) Craig!
GUNSHOT

36:36.273 --> 36:37.547
So, do you not think it looks like...

36:37.593 --> 36:40.266
No, it looks more like Carl Gallagher to me.

36:40.313 --> 36:43.350
- That's what l think.
- Let's get over there and try and eliminate him.

36:43.393 --> 36:44.542
l wish someone would.

36:44.593 --> 36:45.912
< ls Carl in?

36:45.953 --> 36:47.466
(Debbie) l'll handle this.

36:47.513 --> 36:50.107
- How's things, Carl?
- Fine, why?

36:50.153 --> 36:52.951
Looks a bit tired.
Been busy, have we, son?

36:52.993 --> 36:55.223
Where were you about half six
on Tuesday night? >

36:55.273 --> 36:57.912
That's dead easy, he was at
the hospital. Weren't you, Carl?

36:57.953 --> 36:59.591
Oh, what for?

36:59.633 --> 37:03.865
Something he doesn't really want to discuss.

37:03.913 --> 37:04.902
Circumcision.

37:07.153 --> 37:09.064
Right.

37:09.113 --> 37:11.547
Well, come on, onwards and upwards,
eh, Stan?

37:17.233 --> 37:20.623
You know, you're not on your own,
Carl, and there's no shame in it

37:20.673 --> 37:23.426
whatsoever, none, ever.

37:25.113 --> 37:28.662
And you won't look back.
Well, not much.

37:32.233 --> 37:35.384
Are you right in the head?
Are you buying all this shit?

37:36.073 --> 37:38.348
(Veronica) How long before they suss that one?

37:38.393 --> 37:41.226
Enough time to round up some skinheads.

37:41.273 --> 37:45.186
- He was only in overnight. Tuesday night.
- What for?

37:45.233 --> 37:47.383
l can't disclose that.
Boys are very sensitive

37:47.433 --> 37:49.788
about genital surgery.

37:49.833 --> 37:53.985
- Fine. Thank you, sister.
- You're welcome.

37:54.393 --> 37:57.385
l don't care, £50 says that's Carl Gallagher.

37:57.433 --> 37:59.867
No one in their right mind is going
to make something like that up.

37:59.913 --> 38:02.552
Right. £50. Put it there.

38:03.633 --> 38:06.352
Perry, Fizz, Pete and Minty.

38:06.393 --> 38:09.385
Debbie's explained, it's for charity.

38:09.993 --> 38:11.711
Ow!

38:13.073 --> 38:14.426
Will you shut up!

38:14.473 --> 38:16.225
(Debbie) He looks like a leper.

38:16.273 --> 38:17.672
(Veronica) Give us a minute.

38:20.793 --> 38:23.148
- What's this?
- lt's supposed to be a swoosh.

38:23.193 --> 38:25.912
A swoosh. Does Carl have a swoosh?

38:25.953 --> 38:27.227
No.

38:27.273 --> 38:29.867
- (Debbie) Come on Carol, hurry up.
- Should get more than a tenner for this.

38:38.913 --> 38:41.302
Can the No 2 turn to the side, please.

38:44.073 --> 38:45.062
We're fucked.

38:46.393 --> 38:48.145
< Square one.

38:49.593 --> 38:50.582
Sorry, Craig.

38:50.633 --> 38:51.702
Cheers, mate.

38:54.633 --> 38:56.385
He's depressed.

38:56.433 --> 38:58.071
Fiona's dumped him.

38:58.113 --> 39:01.105
No. He's all right, is Craig.

39:01.153 --> 39:05.066
Full-time job, house that's paid for
and not bad in bed.

39:05.113 --> 39:07.069
Take him in the bogs
and suck him off,

39:07.113 --> 39:08.785
could be a decent future in it for you.

39:13.873 --> 39:16.148
Hiya, gorgeous.

39:16.193 --> 39:18.149
Cheer up, it might never happen.

39:18.193 --> 39:20.388
lf it helps,

39:20.433 --> 39:24.028
Fiona told me she didn't know for
definite if the baby was yours.

39:25.713 --> 39:27.704
Sorry, l'm late.

39:29.833 --> 39:30.948
Who are you?

39:30.993 --> 39:34.303
This is Mick. He's helping me out
a couple of nights a week,

39:34.353 --> 39:36.913
so it's up to you
which two nights you drop...

39:36.953 --> 39:41.310
l knew it! You hard-faced,
two-faced, sour-faced bitch!

39:41.353 --> 39:46.222
..and which two nights
you want to work at the Jockey.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.187
l've got you a job, glass collecting.

39:50.233 --> 39:53.384
Since Kash will spend more time in there
socialising, if he's going to stand a chance.

39:53.433 --> 39:54.388
Whoops.

39:54.433 --> 39:57.584
Mick's old enough to serve booze,
so he can cope on his own for an hour.

39:57.633 --> 39:59.544
l'll be back at 1 0, Mick.

39:59.593 --> 40:01.151
No sweat. >

40:10.633 --> 40:15.912
Never mind questions in the house,
we need answers in the house.

40:17.193 --> 40:19.832
lan, in your own time, love.

40:19.873 --> 40:20.862
People forget, it took centuries,

40:20.913 --> 40:25.270
but the working man's vote
is the most powerful weapon

40:25.313 --> 40:27.144
you'll ever possess.

40:27.193 --> 40:29.149
Lest we forget.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.421
Got your toothbrush?

40:30.473 --> 40:31.667
Seven inches!

40:32.153 --> 40:35.270
Oh, hello, where are you
taking the Prince of Darkness?

40:35.313 --> 40:36.871
- Wales.
- Betws-y-coed.

40:36.913 --> 40:39.143
Wales? Fuck for?

40:39.193 --> 40:39.989
Moby Dick.

40:40.033 --> 40:41.830
My sister's just had a baby.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.182
And that's still a big deal in Wales, is it?

40:44.233 --> 40:46.189
You look fantastic, Martin.

40:46.233 --> 40:48.269
Up the arse, when you're ready.

40:48.313 --> 40:50.144
Large white wine, please, Karin.

40:50.193 --> 40:52.184
MUSlC: Wild Thing by The Troggs

40:52.233 --> 40:53.666
Wow!

40:53.713 --> 40:56.625
CHEERlNG AND WHlSTLlNG

41:02.393 --> 41:04.190
Have you got the tickets?

41:04.233 --> 41:05.143
SHE PANTS

41:05.193 --> 41:08.424
Show me to the limo.

41:08.473 --> 41:12.307
l couldn't get a limo so l had to get a minibus.

41:12.353 --> 41:14.469
All right, fair enough.

41:16.873 --> 41:18.943
CHEERlNG AND WHlSTLlNG

41:18.993 --> 41:22.303
Did you say something, Kash?
l can't see you, it's a bit dark.

41:23.953 --> 41:26.148
That is a racist remark.

41:26.193 --> 41:28.263
Now l've been wondering,

41:28.313 --> 41:30.986
a shopkeeper's campaign...

41:32.473 --> 41:34.304
..is on value for money,

41:34.353 --> 41:38.983
when all he and his family's ever
done was bring down the house prices.

41:39.033 --> 41:40.944
< That is way below the belt.

41:40.993 --> 41:43.553
But it's the truth.
Gloves off, you'd better

41:43.593 --> 41:47.108
listen to the echoes, Hiawatha.

41:47.153 --> 41:48.791
LAUGHTER

41:48.833 --> 41:52.109
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:52.153 --> 41:54.667
l offer up for your selectation,

41:54.713 --> 41:57.227
your delectation,

41:57.273 --> 42:00.106
your election.

42:00.153 --> 42:02.144
CHEERlNG

42:02.193 --> 42:05.503
Nothing but a third generation immigrant!

42:05.553 --> 42:08.306
Trying to reinvent the glory of the Union Jack.

42:08.353 --> 42:10.423
CHEERlNG

42:10.513 --> 42:13.425
You two-faced, fascist cunt.

42:13.473 --> 42:17.261
Everybody round here knows
where my heart lies.

42:17.313 --> 42:19.190
My heart's in Chatsworth.

42:19.233 --> 42:22.305
l prove it every single day

42:22.353 --> 42:25.663
by keeping the shop open for 1 2 fucking hours.

42:25.713 --> 42:27.192
APPLAUSE

42:27.233 --> 42:30.908
But at what profit margins,
ladies and gentlemen?

42:30.953 --> 42:33.421
< Oh, flush him out, Kash.

42:35.273 --> 42:38.902
Name a single other shop

42:38.953 --> 42:41.990
that takes milk tokens for booze.

42:42.033 --> 42:45.503
CHEERlNG

42:46.313 --> 42:47.792
Fine!

42:47.833 --> 42:52.429
The only constituents my little
brown friend here supports are

42:52.473 --> 42:56.671
the blacks, the chinks, the complete
fucking leg-irons, the jobless scum,

42:56.713 --> 42:59.944
that bleed this fucking nation dry!

43:00.713 --> 43:02.829
Yeah, Bernie!

43:15.553 --> 43:17.623
One of you get the car.

43:17.673 --> 43:20.233
Now, quick.

43:27.633 --> 43:29.589
Kash for Chatsworth!

43:29.633 --> 43:31.351
CHEERlNG

44:01.513 --> 44:03.822
lt feels weird without her here.

44:05.713 --> 44:08.147
(Carl) l've got one thing l need to say.

44:09.793 --> 44:12.865
The night before he died,

44:12.913 --> 44:15.427
l gobbed on Brendan from the upstairs of a bus

44:15.473 --> 44:17.225
and called him a rag-eyed gonk.

44:21.793 --> 44:23.465
Just that.

44:25.433 --> 44:27.901
The only thing is making sure
everybody knows how much

44:27.953 --> 44:30.831
- a week we need to stay in the black.
- We've always managed before, Debs.

44:30.873 --> 44:32.829
With Fiona's wages, meaning

44:32.873 --> 44:35.307
everyone needs to bring in
an extra £1 5 a week.
