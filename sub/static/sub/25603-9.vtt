00:00.047 --> 00:02.164
Previously on Wynonna Earp:

00:03.453 --> 00:05.850
You let her do this. You
became a vampire for Doc?

00:05.875 --> 00:07.305
And he became one for you.

00:07.330 --> 00:09.367
Seeds in the ground
whispering to one another.

00:09.392 --> 00:10.844
Bulshar can talk to them.

00:10.869 --> 00:12.302
Bushar's ring is following me.

00:12.327 --> 00:13.921
It fits me! No, no!!

00:14.534 --> 00:16.672
- She only took three cards?
- Tarot cards.

00:16.697 --> 00:19.072
He wants to find his
last one, his future.

00:19.097 --> 00:22.061
It's Arabic on the ring! It
means Garden of Paradise.

00:22.086 --> 00:23.984
Bushar is here for the Garden of Eden.

00:24.009 --> 00:26.099
That's what the Ghost River
Triangle is protecting.

00:26.124 --> 00:30.484
- Dear God.
- God has nothing to do with it.

00:33.953 --> 00:37.834
Maybe we need more lube?

00:37.859 --> 00:41.147
No, no! No, no, no, no. No,
don't stop, don't stop.

00:41.172 --> 00:44.109
Keep going. Almost there.

00:44.134 --> 00:47.523
- No!! Ow, ow, ow!
- Ow!!

00:47.548 --> 00:48.575
Ow...

00:48.600 --> 00:50.368
Okay. That's it.

00:50.775 --> 00:53.554
Either Bulshar's ring shrunk
or your finger chubbed up.

00:54.265 --> 00:57.515
- It definitely shrunk.
- YouTube's all out of tricks.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.477
It's just teens doing mean pranks now.

00:59.502 --> 01:00.799
I mean...

01:00.824 --> 01:02.396
does it hurt?

01:02.421 --> 01:05.066
No, not really. Actually, it's fine.

01:05.090 --> 01:06.328
I'll just leave it on.

01:06.353 --> 01:09.680
Uh, you Wonder Woman-punched a
zombie witch across a room.

01:09.705 --> 01:11.945
- Yeah, boy.
- Not "yeah, boy."

01:11.970 --> 01:14.688
No, girl! That ring came off a
withered, chopped-off demon arm;

01:14.713 --> 01:17.178
it turned a face-ripping witch
into the Mother of Dragons;

01:17.203 --> 01:21.006
and it burned Doc's finger,
and turned up in my biscuits!

01:21.031 --> 01:24.822
It also keeps ricocheting back to us
each time we try to get rid of it.

01:24.847 --> 01:28.004
What if next time it hurts
one of our friends? Or...

01:29.454 --> 01:31.288
Okay.

01:31.364 --> 01:35.024
Check the barn, okay? For
the giant bolt-cutters...

01:35.111 --> 01:38.860
from Wynonna's B&E toolkit that I
wasn't supposed to tell you about?

01:38.885 --> 01:40.619
Of course.

01:40.855 --> 01:44.231
Look, try not to touch anything, okay?

01:49.722 --> 01:52.697
I'll get the bolt-cutters.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.882
- Not even you?
- Oh, no.

01:55.907 --> 01:59.537
When we get that thing off...
we get off.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074

02:08.995 --> 02:12.030
- Did we just...?
- It appears as though we did.

02:12.055 --> 02:14.112
Twice.

02:15.599 --> 02:17.472
Did we?

02:18.596 --> 02:20.474
I sure did.

02:20.499 --> 02:23.186
And I'm pretty sure you were here.

02:23.211 --> 02:26.533
Oh, I'm still here.

02:26.565 --> 02:27.918
Wynonna?

02:27.943 --> 02:29.941
- Go away!
- Ocupado!

02:30.026 --> 02:32.932
The minibar is fully stocked!

02:32.957 --> 02:34.924
Decidedly not mini.

02:34.949 --> 02:36.601
Guys, just let me in!

02:36.669 --> 02:40.229
Then you better turn on Incognito
Browsing, 'cause it is NSFW in here.

02:40.254 --> 02:43.497
Gross. I do not need that
seared into my retinas.

02:43.522 --> 02:45.924
So what am I supposed to tell Waverly?
You guys on again?

02:45.949 --> 02:49.637
Oh, we are on... each other.

02:49.662 --> 02:51.772
Okay, great. Well, I'm
just gonna tell her

02:51.797 --> 02:53.943
that you are drinking and fighting.

03:01.173 --> 03:03.392
Those two need separate cages.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.479
Am I to assume you have forgiven me?

03:07.378 --> 03:09.212
For the vamp thing?

03:10.495 --> 03:12.772
I'd say we kissed and made up.

03:12.797 --> 03:16.299
As long as that's all you did...
with your mouth anyway.

03:16.324 --> 03:19.867
Oddly, the pangs of blood-thirst
seem to have lifted.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.045
And I would never do anything...

03:23.861 --> 03:26.040
to betray your trust.

03:26.772 --> 03:28.710
You're such a gentleman.

03:29.728 --> 03:33.488
Except for when you're not...
at my request.

03:33.776 --> 03:35.777
Which is often.

03:36.379 --> 03:40.277
And why I am so spent.

03:42.266 --> 03:45.527
Mm... Let's go to sleep.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.810
And we'll wake up together.

04:01.179 --> 04:03.410
They're mine.

04:25.632 --> 04:29.975
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:30.501 --> 04:32.937
-It's quite robust!

04:32.962 --> 04:36.903
You know it's unusual to find a woman
wearing such a masculine piece?

04:36.928 --> 04:39.296
I suppose tradition has changed.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.077
Yeah, we're all about
challenging gender norms.

04:41.102 --> 04:43.194
Now can you please get this
hideous thing off of her?

04:43.219 --> 04:44.953
Of course.

04:46.683 --> 04:48.551
Here goes.

04:48.576 --> 04:50.554
Oh, my God. Oh, sorry.

04:50.579 --> 04:52.412
Bad experience with losing appendages.

04:52.437 --> 04:55.088
- Ha-ha-ha! She jokes when she's...
- Ovulating?

04:55.113 --> 04:56.686
Dude, no!

04:56.711 --> 04:59.918
Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.
Unless I slip.

04:59.943 --> 05:02.887
But that's why we have insurance
settlements, am I right?

05:03.336 --> 05:05.716
This is gonna be awesome.

05:18.111 --> 05:21.513
How odd. How did you say
you came upon this ring?

05:21.538 --> 05:22.600
Uh...

05:22.625 --> 05:24.578
It's been in my family for generations.

05:24.603 --> 05:25.171
Yeah.

05:25.196 --> 05:27.553
It came... came right over on the boat,

05:27.578 --> 05:28.171
Smuggled

05:28.196 --> 05:30.122
right up Granny Haught's... petticoats.

05:30.147 --> 05:32.916
Recessed markings. What's that word?

05:32.941 --> 05:35.749
- Paradise.
- You know what?

05:35.773 --> 05:36.913
I'm feeling...

05:36.938 --> 05:38.842
Officer Haught?

05:38.868 --> 05:40.468
Yeah, what's up, Suzanne?

05:40.493 --> 05:43.177
Got a disturbance out
on Concession Road 10,

05:43.202 --> 05:45.444
- the abandoned Gardner House.
- Copy.

05:45.469 --> 05:48.341
- Kate?
- Yeah. What's she up to now?

05:48.366 --> 05:50.358
Besides being very vampire?

05:50.383 --> 05:52.709
Thank you so much for your time.

05:52.734 --> 05:54.600
Yeah, thanks.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.732
You know, I already have a buyer!

05:56.757 --> 05:58.600
Already? Sure.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.358
Demon or creep with a ring fetish?

06:00.383 --> 06:02.655
Why pick just one?

06:03.055 --> 06:06.909
Ah, the aroma of earth as
the ground begins to thaw.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.280
Where are we going? Are we
supposed to be doing something?

06:10.305 --> 06:11.874
The tarot cards.

06:11.928 --> 06:14.750
Bulshar found what he was looking for.

06:15.238 --> 06:16.793
Oh! The Garden!

06:16.818 --> 06:21.340
We're gonna head ol' Bulshar
off at the pass, remember?

06:21.767 --> 06:23.510
Today was fun.

06:24.662 --> 06:27.429
Are you, uh, okay with us?

06:28.322 --> 06:31.350
Well, there's the sucky,
bitey, fangy thing.

06:31.375 --> 06:34.270
Which I did... for you.

06:34.896 --> 06:38.607
Who am I kidding? I only feel
like me when I'm with you.

06:44.389 --> 06:46.624
This is giving me a headache.

06:46.833 --> 06:48.467
I've spoiled our walk.

06:48.507 --> 06:50.831
Some things are best left unsaid.

06:50.856 --> 06:52.290
No, Doc.

06:53.132 --> 06:55.499
Something's wrong. I don't feel...

06:55.524 --> 06:57.501
I don't feel well.

06:58.021 --> 07:02.130
It's a trick! It's Bulshar!

07:02.155 --> 07:05.049
- Bulshar?
- Doc, wake up!

07:05.074 --> 07:06.761
Wake up!

07:10.561 --> 07:14.356
Yo, b-boy, where you taking us?!
Where are you taking us?!

07:14.381 --> 07:17.077
No!! You do not want to know
what happened to the last person

07:17.102 --> 07:19.773
who tried to force-feed me granola!!!

07:30.051 --> 07:32.202
Bulshar.

07:32.227 --> 07:36.206
Even for a million-year-old
hell monster, you...

07:36.799 --> 07:38.500
look like cat barf.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.502
Now you know...

07:41.303 --> 07:43.866
our fates are linked.

07:43.891 --> 07:47.032
Your ability to resist my delusion,

07:47.057 --> 07:48.802
it's impressive.

07:48.827 --> 07:50.846
What can I say?

07:50.871 --> 07:53.515
Built up a tolerance to hallucinogens
when I dated that tree planter.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.019
Hmm. Then I need to up my game.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.353
Hand-to-hand it is.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.647
Come on, Ballshaft, what've you got?

08:00.672 --> 08:03.693
I'm going to enjoy this.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.462
Doc?!

08:23.566 --> 08:25.129
Bulshar!

08:25.154 --> 08:26.421
Hello?

08:33.178 --> 08:36.475
Okay. Could be worse, Dubs.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.145
Usually when you wake
up in a strange room,

08:40.169 --> 08:43.816
you gotta spend the whole day
at a walk-in clinic after.

09:07.006 --> 09:09.841
Well, at least there's booze.

09:25.843 --> 09:27.902
It's gone.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.658
Doc?

09:36.738 --> 09:38.911
Wynonna. Thank God.

09:39.286 --> 09:41.270
- You can hear me?
- Yes.

09:41.295 --> 09:44.857
What happened? I just... died.

09:44.882 --> 09:47.631
- But I'm back.
- How? Back where?

09:47.656 --> 09:49.881
Shorty's basement. I...

09:49.906 --> 09:53.219
I... I think I'm okay. Where are you?

09:54.590 --> 09:56.557
Nowhere good.

09:56.582 --> 09:58.216
I can see you. Do you see me?

09:58.241 --> 10:01.269
No. I do not know how I got here.

10:01.571 --> 10:04.604
- Did you see Bulshar?
- Bulshar? No. Why?

10:04.832 --> 10:08.435
I can barely move, Wynonna.
I am near-paralyzed.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.629
Okay, don't panic. I'll
explain everything

10:10.654 --> 10:13.655
as soon as I find you, which
I'm gonna do right now.

10:14.245 --> 10:18.453
Please do, Wynonna. Please do.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.268
Ha! Missed me, dickhead.

10:35.876 --> 10:38.472
There's always more dickheads.

10:44.182 --> 10:45.937
Come on!!

10:46.707 --> 10:48.857
Poison dart?!

10:50.378 --> 10:52.320
Wynonna!!

11:00.144 --> 11:02.037
I'm back.

11:02.216 --> 11:03.616
Are you okay?

11:03.641 --> 11:07.040
Uh, does a molten-hot
spike to the eye count?

11:07.065 --> 11:10.253
Which... smarts, by the way!

11:10.278 --> 11:12.599
Why does Bulshwhack
have to make it hurt?

11:12.624 --> 11:14.884
Because that may be the point of this.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.302
Pain is the end game.

11:17.327 --> 11:18.961
Great pep talk.

11:18.986 --> 11:22.642
But I'm... I'm like metal.

11:22.667 --> 11:26.603
The more you hit it,
the stronger it gets!

11:26.628 --> 11:30.008
And I'm shiny. And dense.

11:30.033 --> 11:33.045
Holy crap, I did learn
stuff in high school.

11:35.060 --> 11:37.956
Careful. The cable guy
didn't see anybody leave.

11:37.981 --> 11:39.256
Did he leave?

11:39.281 --> 11:41.006
Or are we gonna walk
in on a normal-nosed

11:41.031 --> 11:42.513
Kate giving him a fangy turbo-hickey?

11:44.863 --> 11:46.669
Maybe she's renovating?

11:46.694 --> 11:49.654
Come on!

11:49.679 --> 11:51.943
Put the hammer down!

11:51.968 --> 11:54.389
Oh, it's you do-good dorks.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.849
- Mercedes?
- In the flesh.

11:55.874 --> 11:57.676
Well, what's left of it.

11:57.701 --> 11:58.928
What are you doing?

11:58.953 --> 12:02.316
Uh, my douchepecker brother,
may he rest in hell...

12:02.341 --> 12:04.542
Still may be too good for Tucker.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.161
He changed the combo while playing Igor

12:06.186 --> 12:09.105
to those face-ripping bitches.
Ergo, hammer.

12:09.130 --> 12:11.097
Hey, do you guys know why
there was bloody sheets

12:11.122 --> 12:12.823
and all those sex toys on my bed?

12:12.848 --> 12:15.462
Uh... there's been an uninvited guest.

12:15.487 --> 12:18.489
Oh. Whatever. Squatters gotta squat.

12:18.514 --> 12:21.255
We missed you, Mercedes.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.530
Wynonna has been calling.

12:23.555 --> 12:25.099
Well, I been busy, dawg.

12:25.124 --> 12:28.888
Flying all over the world,
surgery after surgery,

12:28.913 --> 12:31.013
and, uh, nothing took.

12:31.038 --> 12:33.295
There's a woman in Venezuela:

12:33.320 --> 12:37.347
muy underground hashtag
facial reconstruction.

12:37.372 --> 12:41.248
So here I am, a mutant...
in constant pain,

12:41.273 --> 12:43.931
trying to break into my own safe.

12:44.759 --> 12:46.942
Are you two just gonna stand
there like a couple of dildos?

12:46.967 --> 12:49.644
Don't tell anybody I wasted a bullet.

12:49.669 --> 12:53.356
Okay, okay, okay.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.411
Ah!

12:58.436 --> 13:00.739
Oh!

13:00.764 --> 13:04.743
Oh!! Oh, my wads!

13:04.887 --> 13:07.864
We've got company.

13:07.889 --> 13:09.880
Yeah, I thought we might.

13:10.554 --> 13:12.652
Argh! Ouch!

13:30.051 --> 13:32.604
Acid?! Really?!

13:32.920 --> 13:36.690
Wynonna. Stop and think.

13:36.715 --> 13:40.257
Count your cards. And be methodical.

13:40.966 --> 13:43.782
Not my brand, John Henry.

14:01.113 --> 14:04.769
- What is it, Derek?
- I know this is weird,

14:04.794 --> 14:09.408
but I just can't get your
friend's ring outta my head.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.348
- May I?
- He's a jeweller.

14:11.373 --> 14:14.153
Uh, yeah. Where do you think I
pawn every bit of bling I own?

14:14.178 --> 14:17.058
- Ah, it won't take a minute.
- Bye, Derek.

14:17.083 --> 14:19.567
There's nothing left for you to get
your grubby little hands on here.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.195
Oh, I must see it.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.787
I must have it.

14:23.812 --> 14:25.403
Spoiler alert: Derek's a demon.

14:25.428 --> 14:28.192
Is every dick trumpet
in Purgatory a demon?

14:28.965 --> 14:31.247
Ow! Back off, Derek!

14:31.272 --> 14:34.328
My fingers can cut diamonds.

14:34.353 --> 14:37.394
Flesh is no match. Give me the ring!

14:37.419 --> 14:40.591
- Let her go, Derek.
- You know I can't take it off, Derek!

14:40.616 --> 14:42.898
Everyone stop saying Derek! Ah!

14:42.923 --> 14:44.302
I must pay fealty!

14:44.327 --> 14:47.529
Ultimate fealty to Bulshar!

14:47.554 --> 14:50.075
Bulshar? The demon husband
of the venom-spewing,

14:50.100 --> 14:51.417
face-stealing monster-wives?

14:51.442 --> 14:54.544
Yeah, that's the guy.

14:56.365 --> 14:59.262
Ah...

15:02.191 --> 15:03.208
Cut it off!

15:03.679 --> 15:06.559
Or I'll kill Ginger One and Ginger Two!

15:07.772 --> 15:11.545
Bitch, you just brought
sparks to an Earp-ferno!

15:13.848 --> 15:16.316
- Oh, you want it, Derek?
- Yes.

15:16.341 --> 15:18.209
Huh? Huh?

15:18.234 --> 15:20.864
Take it!!

15:20.889 --> 15:23.591
Take it...

15:31.857 --> 15:36.311
The face. Why is it always the face?!

15:37.467 --> 15:39.950
Ugh!

15:43.090 --> 15:45.695
This is complete madness.

15:47.340 --> 15:50.008
What's on your face? Is that popcorn?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.660
I'd die for some popcorn.

15:51.685 --> 15:55.849
I hope I don't get killed by
eating too much delicious popcorn!

15:55.874 --> 15:57.666
I need a new plan.

15:58.948 --> 16:00.682
I have a no plan.

16:01.638 --> 16:03.671
You need to rest.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.747
You're right. Not trying
used to be my MO.

16:06.772 --> 16:08.802
I've changed, man.

16:10.322 --> 16:12.807
What am I doing wrong?!

16:14.807 --> 16:18.020
This is what it feels like
to be a Revenant. Oh!

16:18.045 --> 16:20.689
Pfft. It sucks donkey schlong.

16:21.138 --> 16:23.692
Donkey Kong.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.360
It's like a video game, Doc.

16:25.727 --> 16:27.779
Oh, good, my forte.

16:27.804 --> 16:29.935
And if there's one thing I
know about video games:

16:29.960 --> 16:31.117
there's always a way out.

16:31.142 --> 16:32.944
There's always a way to beat the system.

16:32.969 --> 16:36.162
Ai! Ai! Ai! Hot! My ass is hot.

16:36.187 --> 16:39.582
If you're looking for validation,
I will not disagree.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.875
The floor is melting, Doc! I'm out!

16:42.900 --> 16:45.575
Wynonna, do not do anything foolish!

16:45.600 --> 16:50.997
Leroy... Jenkins!!!

16:51.022 --> 16:53.494
Ah!

16:55.008 --> 16:59.033
Sonofabitch! That's not
where that goes, Bulshar!

17:00.509 --> 17:03.070
Wynonna, can you hear me?

17:03.095 --> 17:06.358
- Doc, yeah!
- Where are you?

17:07.165 --> 17:09.155
I'm home.

17:10.346 --> 17:12.907
Excellent.

17:12.933 --> 17:16.787
How will my plaything
endure this new test?

17:17.179 --> 17:20.003
Wyatt Earp's heir will watch.

17:20.029 --> 17:22.181
For all eternity.

17:22.205 --> 17:24.560
She will watch as I enter,

17:24.585 --> 17:29.009
watch as the world burns,
as I enslave humanity,

17:29.034 --> 17:33.637
and know it was all her fault.

17:40.249 --> 17:43.873
Anything come at you yet, or have
you learned to die in silence?

17:43.898 --> 17:47.985
I just hit my stupid hipbone
on the stupid chair.

17:48.066 --> 17:49.986
Is there whisky?

17:50.400 --> 17:53.681
Yeah, why? You want me to splash
some into the fireplace for you?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.771
For you, to numb the pain.

17:55.796 --> 17:58.077
Great idea.

17:59.522 --> 18:02.333
Ugh! I don't know what that
is, but it's not whisky.

18:02.358 --> 18:04.927
- Do that again.
- Eff that. It tastes like bear piss.

18:04.952 --> 18:07.208
With your feet. I can
feel the vibration.

18:09.686 --> 18:14.345
Yes, that! I can hear it. I can
hear it coming from above!

18:14.370 --> 18:16.576
'K. Tell me if it's getting closer.

18:16.601 --> 18:18.900
Yes! Yes, that is the bearing!

18:18.925 --> 18:21.310
Wynonna, you found me.

18:21.335 --> 18:22.702
It's dirt.

18:23.266 --> 18:26.685
On your face. How long
has it been happening?

18:26.710 --> 18:29.025
Since the ordeal began.

18:29.221 --> 18:31.289
Trickle by trickle.

18:31.314 --> 18:33.548
He's burying you alive?

18:33.573 --> 18:35.274
Yes.

18:35.299 --> 18:39.185
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because of a conversation I had...

18:39.727 --> 18:41.664
with Bulshar.

18:42.101 --> 18:45.380
I came upon him among a grove of trees.

18:45.405 --> 18:48.591
And under threat, he insisted
I make myself useful.

18:48.616 --> 18:50.756
Help him move?

18:50.781 --> 18:52.799
He offered me a deal.

18:53.518 --> 18:55.802
He would cleanse my soul

18:55.827 --> 18:59.139
if I convinced you to do his bidding.

18:59.941 --> 19:02.642
Tell me you didn't make
a deal with Bulshar.

19:02.667 --> 19:05.313
Aligning myself with
a demon against you?

19:05.338 --> 19:07.271
I refused.

19:07.296 --> 19:10.031
Bulshar's such a drama queen.

19:10.589 --> 19:15.489
Hang in there. I'll be back.
Just need a crowbar.

19:22.375 --> 19:24.788
No sudden T-Rex attack.

19:25.743 --> 19:27.793
No flaming-hot hailstorm.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.801
No forcing me to watch golf. Good.

19:30.826 --> 19:35.263
It's like the ring, my... my
hand had a... a mind of its own.

19:35.288 --> 19:38.858
Uh, yeah, you melted Demon
Derek's face like Velveeta.

19:38.883 --> 19:40.839
What if it face-melts someone human?

19:41.772 --> 19:44.674
Everything you Earps touch
is as cursed as you are.

19:44.699 --> 19:47.334
And if that is Bulshar's
ring, you're screwed!

19:47.359 --> 19:49.827
I was locked in a basement by
face-ripping demon-witches

19:49.852 --> 19:52.651
and the only thing they
were terrified of was him.

19:52.676 --> 19:54.567
Well, Wynonna ended them.

19:54.592 --> 19:58.328
Well, goody for her. My face still looks
like a goddamn charcuterie board!

19:58.353 --> 20:00.253
You're still beautiful, Mercedes.

20:03.184 --> 20:06.019
And you ate edibles for breakfast.

20:07.495 --> 20:10.330
There's only one way to... get it off!

20:10.355 --> 20:13.504
No more cutting off hand bits.

20:13.529 --> 20:17.612
That ring on you - something
very powerful is at work here.

20:17.637 --> 20:22.029
Your sex life is either about to get
really great or very, very, very bad.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.892
Girl... put a mitt on it!

20:26.472 --> 20:29.524
- Not a permanent solution.
- Well, I tried.

20:29.549 --> 20:31.901
And now... I've got a face to catch.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.660
Good luck, girls.

20:37.510 --> 20:41.046
Look, if... demon magic's
what's keeping that ring on,

20:41.071 --> 20:45.412
then maybe we need demon
magic to get it off.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.752
Jeremy and I will put
our heads together.

20:47.777 --> 20:50.737
Okay.

20:50.762 --> 20:53.526
Speak of the veggie devil. Jeremy.

20:53.551 --> 20:56.542
I need to search through
the archives to find some

20:56.567 --> 20:58.433
BBD ring-removal hoodoo.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.508
Okay, later. Look, Robin
gave me the login

21:00.533 --> 21:02.220
for all the Parks and Rec
surveillance footage,

21:02.245 --> 21:04.612
and I... I noticed something
on the Eagle Nest Cam.

21:04.637 --> 21:06.538
Something very Bulshary.

21:06.563 --> 21:09.565
Bulshary? Wh-what... Where are you?

21:09.590 --> 21:11.135
I'll send you my location.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.982
I definitely don't want to go in alone.

21:18.916 --> 21:22.112
Whoa!!

21:22.137 --> 21:24.617
Much as I'd love to stand
here and kill you...

21:24.642 --> 21:27.596
be a good Bobo and hand me that sickle.

21:29.144 --> 21:32.583
Remind me to send Mama a thank-you
card for letting you out of that well.

21:40.096 --> 21:41.597
Cool.

21:41.622 --> 21:44.872
Die, start over. Kill Bobo, start over.

21:44.940 --> 21:47.491
Bobo Del Ray.

21:47.516 --> 21:50.184
Yeah, stinking up the barn.

21:51.109 --> 21:54.065
On the bright side, I'm not back
to Shorty's basement, so...

21:54.090 --> 21:57.130
Must've levelled up.

21:57.679 --> 21:59.216
Doc.

21:59.241 --> 22:01.701
How is there so much dirt? I've
been gone for, like, two minutes.

22:01.726 --> 22:04.198
Many...

22:04.223 --> 22:06.165
many times.

22:25.245 --> 22:27.413
For the thousandth time, I'll say it:

22:27.438 --> 22:31.233
Whatever you have been doing
with Bobo, try something else.

22:31.258 --> 22:34.547
I shot him every time.

22:35.198 --> 22:38.883
So... no Peacemaker.

22:40.482 --> 22:43.117
What's the worst that can happen?

22:43.142 --> 22:45.177
Well, you die.

22:45.202 --> 22:46.532
Again.

22:46.557 --> 22:50.369
- The camera is mounted up there.
- Which way does it look?

22:50.394 --> 22:51.516
Yeah. And what did you see?

22:51.541 --> 22:54.664
Like in a weird, overgrown
mound of tree roots.

22:54.689 --> 22:57.188
But Bulshar was looking
for the Garden, right?

22:57.213 --> 23:00.718
So what if the staircase...

23:01.343 --> 23:02.856
Was the entrance.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.527
- Yes! High-five!
- Wait! No! Hand of death!

23:05.552 --> 23:07.262
Oh, yes. Supportive elbow bump.

23:07.287 --> 23:09.455
Uh, guys, speaking of death hand...

23:14.420 --> 23:16.250
Bad Bobo! Stop!

23:16.929 --> 23:18.677
No gun.

23:18.718 --> 23:20.317
Come on, man.

23:20.342 --> 23:22.485
I know we've never been besties...

23:22.510 --> 23:24.233
This is getting us nowhere.

23:24.258 --> 23:28.195
You and Juan Carlo and Constance
sealed Bulshar underground.

23:28.220 --> 23:30.618
There has to be a way to beat him.

23:32.321 --> 23:34.830
Juan Carlo...

23:34.855 --> 23:37.999
and Constance... are dead.

23:38.024 --> 23:41.828
And I... am no longer the Robert Svane

23:41.853 --> 23:43.507
that helped cast that spell.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.773
He's dead, too.

23:45.798 --> 23:50.889
Dude, it makes me feel
really gross to say this!

23:51.413 --> 23:54.453
- Help me.
- Help...

23:55.442 --> 23:57.109
Robert, please.

24:03.653 --> 24:06.028
Oh...

24:11.305 --> 24:15.347
You know me, Bobo. You know my family.

24:17.198 --> 24:19.647
My mother, she let you out.

24:19.672 --> 24:23.170
Willa... you loved her.

24:24.670 --> 24:27.843
Waverly... your angel.

24:27.868 --> 24:31.596
Remember? You saved her.

24:33.245 --> 24:35.601
We can fight, Bobo.

24:36.239 --> 24:38.603
My resolve is gone.

24:39.326 --> 24:42.357
From the day he cursed
Wyatt Earp's ancestors...

24:42.599 --> 24:45.152
to fight all those he
had a hand in killing,

24:45.177 --> 24:47.487
over and over,

24:47.677 --> 24:49.823
Bulshar won.

24:50.080 --> 24:55.286
And it will never... ever... end.

24:55.753 --> 24:58.289
We can't give up.

24:59.277 --> 25:01.293
I did.

25:03.074 --> 25:05.213
And so will you.

25:08.843 --> 25:10.999
- Did an animal make this?
- Damn.

25:11.024 --> 25:12.923
I think it's actually called a lodge.

25:12.948 --> 25:16.599
You're the beaver expert. so whatever
it is, we need to rip it up.

25:16.649 --> 25:17.564
Here.

25:17.589 --> 25:19.790
What, you carry hatchets
in your backpack?

25:19.815 --> 25:22.517
This is Purgatory, Jeremy. I carry
a lot of shit in my backpack.

25:22.542 --> 25:25.144
- Wait! It's Bobo.
- Well...

25:25.169 --> 25:27.036
Death to Bobo!!
-No!
-Are you crazy?!

25:27.061 --> 25:29.462
He can move metal with his mind!

25:29.487 --> 25:32.324
Then grab a pointy stick.

26:01.878 --> 26:05.022
Are you sure this isn't hell?

26:06.756 --> 26:08.693
I'm sure.

26:10.012 --> 26:11.697
How do you know?

26:13.072 --> 26:17.201
Because, darlin', in hell I was alone.

26:17.719 --> 26:20.038
I never gave up on you, Doc.

26:22.978 --> 26:25.189
Even when it looked like it.

26:26.728 --> 26:29.263
I wish you hadn't given up on me.

26:31.568 --> 26:33.443
I would never.

26:33.468 --> 26:35.178
Not... on you.

26:35.779 --> 26:38.093
Not on our daughter.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.652
Never.

26:47.161 --> 26:50.697
Would it be selfish to ask you
to make one last attempt?

26:52.245 --> 26:55.364
I'll understand if you deem me unworthy.

26:57.367 --> 27:00.236
This would be so much
easier if you were...

27:26.796 --> 27:29.023
Hey. Bobo.

27:29.363 --> 27:30.706
Bobo!!

27:30.731 --> 27:33.110
Ah!

27:36.563 --> 27:39.708
He... he's got 'em.

27:39.733 --> 27:42.201
- Them who?
- Wynonna.

27:42.226 --> 27:44.894
Henry. Doc. Out here.

27:44.919 --> 27:47.534
No, they're in the... barn.
They were having sex.

27:47.559 --> 27:49.333
I thought you said they
were having a fight!

27:49.358 --> 27:52.043
- Bulshar's in their minds.
- How is he in their minds, Bobo?!

27:52.068 --> 27:54.183
Mr. Bobo?

27:54.208 --> 27:55.675
No! Ah!

27:55.700 --> 27:57.544
Don't you see?

27:57.569 --> 28:00.731
He... He's everywhere.

28:00.756 --> 28:02.973
These are his groves.

28:02.998 --> 28:05.028
His trees.

28:05.730 --> 28:07.564
What does he want with our people?

28:07.589 --> 28:09.438
Same as always.

28:10.802 --> 28:13.442
Revenge.

28:16.254 --> 28:19.238
- Baby got back.
As in: I'm back again and...

28:19.263 --> 28:21.687
A waste of an entrance.

28:21.712 --> 28:24.496
I want a do-over.

28:29.049 --> 28:31.836
Truman Show much?

28:33.364 --> 28:37.486
Where you been, pervert?
Figures you like to watch.

28:37.511 --> 28:41.347
John Henry Holliday could've
made it so much easier.

28:41.372 --> 28:44.449
But his resistance brought
this trial upon you.

28:44.474 --> 28:48.103
That's nifty. Is that the way out?

28:49.728 --> 28:51.362
Thought so.

28:52.007 --> 28:55.234
You're all feathers till
I don't have my gun.

29:00.152 --> 29:01.820
Neat trick.

29:02.443 --> 29:04.167
Hope you didn't forget the ammo.

29:04.192 --> 29:06.327
I make the rules.

29:06.687 --> 29:10.667
And soon that weapon will be mine.

29:13.035 --> 29:15.403
The Tower is the weapon.

29:15.428 --> 29:17.924
It protects the Garden.

29:19.487 --> 29:22.595
And sends demons back to hell.

29:31.054 --> 29:32.688
Only the Revenants.

29:32.713 --> 29:35.405
The ones I created with the curse.

29:35.430 --> 29:37.798
I get it. You're Original Demon Classic.

29:37.823 --> 29:41.864
You will give it to me. Willingly.

29:42.743 --> 29:45.082
So you can't take Peacemaker.

29:45.107 --> 29:49.776
That's good to know. Tell you
what: when I break this game,

29:49.801 --> 29:53.051
I'll shove her up your ass and blow
your guts out through your brains.

29:53.076 --> 29:54.809
Willingly.

29:55.817 --> 29:57.922
I'm coming, Doc.

29:57.947 --> 30:00.174
Bulshar found me.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.684
He blew a cloud of dust.

30:02.709 --> 30:04.684
It was like a waking dream.

30:04.709 --> 30:06.377
Is this a dream?

30:06.402 --> 30:10.059
It could be spores. Some kind
of hallucinogenic fungus?

30:10.084 --> 30:12.418
Oh... I was there forever.

30:12.507 --> 30:14.441
I thought it was gonna go on forever.

30:14.466 --> 30:16.909
- Now Wynonna's there forever.
- Where?!

30:16.934 --> 30:19.568
Everywhere and nowhere at the same time.

30:19.593 --> 30:22.083
I killed her...

30:22.108 --> 30:24.282
and she killed me

30:24.307 --> 30:26.629
over and over again.

30:26.654 --> 30:29.762
Okay.

30:31.774 --> 30:33.583
Ah!!

30:35.289 --> 30:36.878
Doc?

30:36.903 --> 30:38.965
She wanted to keep fighting Bulshar.

30:39.001 --> 30:42.528
But I was weak. I broke.

30:42.985 --> 30:45.452
- Wynonna won't break.
- Maybe there's still time.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.239
We must be goingin the right direction!

30:47.264 --> 30:48.689
W-w-we're close.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.381
No, I can feel them.

30:51.593 --> 30:52.946
That way!

30:52.971 --> 30:54.372
Okay.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.944
Your father's ring.

31:01.735 --> 31:03.238
You found it.

31:03.993 --> 31:05.594
Or wait.

31:05.619 --> 31:08.742
Maybe it found you?

31:10.068 --> 31:12.205
Doc! Oh!

31:21.996 --> 31:24.551
You did it, Wynonna.

31:26.880 --> 31:31.059
I'm free. I'm free.

31:31.444 --> 31:34.184
I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.

31:35.482 --> 31:38.021
Did you always have this moustache?

31:41.541 --> 31:43.598
Thank you.

31:43.623 --> 31:46.106
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, Doc.

31:49.023 --> 31:51.625
- How'd you defeat Bobo?
- Oh...

31:51.650 --> 31:55.434
I want to say boobs, but
I'm just so, so tired.

31:56.405 --> 31:58.217
And Bobo's gone.

31:58.242 --> 32:00.010
Then bravo.

32:00.035 --> 32:02.207
What really happened?

32:03.007 --> 32:07.469
Bulshar showed up with some
kind of red Narnia door.

32:08.414 --> 32:11.564
Are you ready to take the game to him?

32:14.502 --> 32:16.686
Well, let's do this.

32:31.771 --> 32:35.040
- Our exit strategy.
- Hold on.

32:35.065 --> 32:36.539
Bulshar!!

32:37.746 --> 32:39.947
Come out here, squirrel-nuts!

32:41.417 --> 32:43.546
Wynonna, come on.

32:44.310 --> 32:47.257
It's another trick, Doc. It has to be.

32:49.486 --> 32:51.386
You're free to go.

32:51.411 --> 32:53.043
We're not falling for that.

32:53.068 --> 32:55.057
I can no longer keep you here.

32:56.518 --> 32:58.061
You've won.

32:58.086 --> 32:59.770
That's where I shot you.

33:01.742 --> 33:03.608
Peacemaker can hurt you.

33:03.638 --> 33:04.942
Don't be stupid.

33:04.967 --> 33:07.946
You saw the cards.

33:07.971 --> 33:11.239
You know our fates... are intertwined.

33:11.264 --> 33:13.075
Come on, baby.

33:13.100 --> 33:15.370
Blast his ass.

33:25.098 --> 33:27.674
Is that it? Is it over?

33:35.542 --> 33:38.767
Let's see what's behind door number one.

34:05.137 --> 34:07.717
Alright. We did it.

34:09.165 --> 34:12.734
We did it! This is where
Bulshar blew that stuff at us.

34:12.802 --> 34:15.536
We weren't having a roll in the hay!
That made no sense!

34:15.605 --> 34:17.583
No, none at all.

34:18.072 --> 34:21.187
I'm still pissed you sold your
soul to stupid, sexy Kate, Doc,

34:21.212 --> 34:22.702
but we did it!

34:24.235 --> 34:26.524
Bulshar's dead.

34:31.054 --> 34:33.056
Did we break the curse?

34:33.514 --> 34:35.324
Wynonna?!

34:35.973 --> 34:38.634
Ha! Nicole, I've never been so happy

34:38.659 --> 34:41.353
to hear your stupid, bossy voice!

34:43.161 --> 34:45.292
Ugh!

34:45.577 --> 34:48.446
No! No, this is the beginning.

34:48.536 --> 34:50.047
Wynonna?

34:50.840 --> 34:52.507
Wynonna?

34:53.045 --> 34:54.280
Oh, thank God.

34:54.304 --> 34:57.904
- Where are you?
- I do not know how I got here.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.565
I can barely move, Wynonna.
I'm near-paralyzed.

35:01.590 --> 35:03.520
No...!!!

35:46.983 --> 35:48.583
Wynonna?

35:50.061 --> 35:53.836
You can't kill me.

35:53.861 --> 35:56.262
I can keep this up forever.

35:57.303 --> 35:59.037
I'm just getting warmed up.

35:59.062 --> 36:01.296
There is no victory.

36:01.603 --> 36:03.437
Only surrender.

36:05.670 --> 36:07.571
Not in my vocabulary.

36:08.532 --> 36:10.800
You're such fun!

36:13.151 --> 36:14.785
And all alone.

36:16.157 --> 36:19.553
Well... almost.

36:26.202 --> 36:28.479
Did you make me dig them?

36:29.511 --> 36:33.017
She won't give up.
Waverly won't give up.

36:33.042 --> 36:35.861
They won't give up. She's
gonna come for me.

36:35.886 --> 36:37.530
And we'll beat you together.

36:37.555 --> 36:40.532
Nobody's looking for you.

36:40.557 --> 36:45.525
An infinity could pass before
anyone even knows you're missing.

36:45.550 --> 36:50.165
We all die alone, Ms. Earp.

36:50.190 --> 36:54.171
And lonely death is coming for you too.
Very soon.

36:54.196 --> 36:56.931
- I don't want to be alone.
- Of course not.

36:56.956 --> 36:58.728
Wouldn't you rather be
with your loved ones

36:58.753 --> 37:03.423
for those precious moments
before it all comes to an end?

37:03.448 --> 37:07.246
- Were they lonely?
- They were abandoned.

37:07.271 --> 37:08.510
By me.

37:08.535 --> 37:11.148
Ah, I see.

37:11.173 --> 37:12.454
Deep down,

37:12.479 --> 37:15.697
- you wish to punish them.
- No.

37:15.819 --> 37:18.196
I want to save them!

37:19.264 --> 37:22.034
Whoa. This is it! You can
see these stairs, right?

37:22.059 --> 37:24.095
They're not a mirage?
They're really here?

37:26.713 --> 37:28.914
Yep, they're real.

37:28.939 --> 37:31.838
- And up there?
- What Bulshar is searching for.

37:31.863 --> 37:33.174
Paradise.

37:33.199 --> 37:35.447
Whoa! Hey, hey! Do not
climb those stairs!

37:35.472 --> 37:38.840
- Why not?
- Guys! I think I found them!

37:45.526 --> 37:47.849
You need the Tower to
get into the Garden.

37:49.380 --> 37:51.536
Peacemaker is the Tower.

37:51.561 --> 37:54.899
If you require added incentive...

37:54.924 --> 37:57.859
I have many more games up my sleeve.

37:57.884 --> 37:59.948
Help!

37:59.973 --> 38:03.890
Help me! Please!

38:05.177 --> 38:08.781
- Asshole.
- I can keep that up forever too.

38:08.806 --> 38:11.339
- Are they alive?!
- Yeah. But they're scared.

38:11.364 --> 38:13.156
Whatever's happening to them isn't good.

38:13.181 --> 38:15.000
Please hurry!

38:18.622 --> 38:20.890
Wynonna, stay strong!

38:20.915 --> 38:22.349
Don't...

38:22.374 --> 38:25.183
No. Do not give in.

38:25.208 --> 38:27.807
Wynonna!!!

38:27.832 --> 38:30.491
Wynonna! It's me!

38:30.516 --> 38:32.017
Waverly!

38:32.042 --> 38:34.733
- Waverly?
- Wynonna?!!

38:34.758 --> 38:36.757
Ah!! Wynonna!!

38:36.782 --> 38:39.484
- Doc, Doc!
- Doc!

38:39.509 --> 38:42.421
Wynonna! Don't do it!

38:42.446 --> 38:44.414
Wynonna!!!

38:44.439 --> 38:47.687
Wynonna!!

38:47.712 --> 38:52.742
There is only one way to save the
ones you love from this torture.

38:52.767 --> 38:56.209
- Please!
- Wynonna!!!

38:59.796 --> 39:01.864
You'll let them go?

39:01.889 --> 39:04.114
I give you my word.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.588
And I keep my word...

39:07.924 --> 39:10.933
just as I keep my curses.

39:12.495 --> 39:14.525
I'm sorry.

39:18.884 --> 39:20.651
But I love you.

39:28.675 --> 39:30.223
She's alive!

39:30.248 --> 39:34.184
- Oh, thank God.
- Doc, too. Sort of.

39:34.209 --> 39:37.004
Come on, sweetie. Come on.
Come back to us.

39:37.029 --> 39:39.887
Come on, please? Please wake up. Please!

39:39.912 --> 39:42.614
- Waverly, your hand!
- Oh!

39:42.639 --> 39:45.270
Ah!

39:45.295 --> 39:46.885
- Talk to me! You're safe.
- Doc!

39:46.910 --> 39:48.844
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

39:48.869 --> 39:50.671
You're out. You're okay.

39:50.696 --> 39:52.005
Where are we?

39:52.030 --> 39:54.567
Bulshar, he brought you
here, but it's okay.

39:54.592 --> 39:56.645
It's okay. You're safe.

40:02.158 --> 40:04.197
Say you didn't.

40:05.207 --> 40:08.448
Say you did not give
up Wyatt Earp's gun.

40:19.252 --> 40:22.236
Maybe Bulshar knows that
you've got the best chance

40:22.261 --> 40:24.845
of any Earp heir to end
the curse, so he cheated.

40:24.870 --> 40:26.338
He doesn't care about the curse.

40:26.363 --> 40:28.636
And he didn't cheat. He beat me.

40:29.452 --> 40:33.522
He needs the Tower to get
into the garden. He has it.

40:34.323 --> 40:36.593
We have nothing left to fight him with.

40:36.618 --> 40:38.117
We have us.

40:39.918 --> 40:44.488
An almost alcoholic MILF,
an unreliable vampire,

40:44.884 --> 40:46.785
an underfunded sheriff.

40:46.810 --> 40:49.063
At least you're still pretty great.

40:49.088 --> 40:51.990
At least things can't get any worse.

40:52.812 --> 40:54.646
This is stuck to my finger.

40:54.714 --> 40:56.116
Bulshar's ring?

40:56.141 --> 40:59.209
- Well, actually, Bobo said...
- What?

40:59.234 --> 41:01.701
No!! No. I melted a face.

41:01.726 --> 41:04.295
Yeah, okay, a demon face,
sure, but I can't control it.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.988
Okay.

41:06.284 --> 41:07.884
That's worse.

41:09.053 --> 41:12.153
Look, we know where he's going. Okay?

41:12.178 --> 41:14.538
We'll... take the fight
to him, at the stairs.

41:14.563 --> 41:15.509
Stairs?

41:15.534 --> 41:17.538
The ones that supposedly
lead to the Garden

41:17.563 --> 41:19.367
where he planted you and Doc.

41:19.999 --> 41:22.896
No. I didn't see any stairs.

41:25.059 --> 41:26.652
Oh.

41:28.007 --> 41:30.823
Maybe they can only be
seen by the righteous.

41:31.917 --> 41:33.751
By those who are good.

41:34.193 --> 41:36.785
You're not just good, Wynonna.

41:36.810 --> 41:39.122
You're my sister.

41:41.569 --> 41:45.813
You're a freakin' angel and
you can't get this off?

41:45.838 --> 41:49.574
And I might need to wear a
Niagara Falls oven mitten...

41:49.642 --> 41:51.634
forever!

41:51.659 --> 41:53.511
'Cause all it does is hurt people!

42:12.192 --> 42:14.006
My face!

42:14.915 --> 42:16.951
My freakin' face!

42:17.327 --> 42:20.960
Oh, Mercedes Gardner is back, suckers.

42:22.611 --> 42:26.339
Waverly Earp... you
sweet little lesbian,

42:26.364 --> 42:29.504
you did it, you healed me.
