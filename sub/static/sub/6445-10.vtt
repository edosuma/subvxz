WEBVTT

00:18.602 --> 00:20.718
I need 11 copies of each
by tomorrow morning...

00:20.896 --> 00:22.978
...and before my macchiato goes arctic.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.764
Assistants just don't have the stamina
they used to have.

00:25.943 --> 00:29.527
Excuse me, Miss Lake. With all
due respect, I'm not an assistant.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.528
I'm a reporter.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.447
Of course you are.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.118
Unfortunately...

00:41.375 --> 00:42.364
...Sullivan...

00:42.543 --> 00:45.785
...what matters is that I can see
Gotham from my new ofﬁce...

00:45.963 --> 00:50.582
...and you.... Oh, well, you, hon,
you work below sea level.

00:52.136 --> 00:56.971
At the risk of heresy, I would rather be
snorkeling for the rest of my life...

00:57.141 --> 00:59.302
...than destroy a man's career
based on rumor.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.558
| only print the truth.
And if you haven't noticed...

01:04.732 --> 01:08.566
...I print it on page one, section B,
every week.

01:15.784 --> 01:20.699
Ron, I know for a fact that this
guy's on steroids. He's a juicer.

01:20.873 --> 01:24.411
I can smell the slow-roasting ink
of tomorrow's headline.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.952
Well, you said you wanted someone
with their ﬁnger on the pulse...

01:28.130 --> 01:31.122
...of the city.
Well, I just hit an artery.

01:34.470 --> 01:36.802
Well, if it isn't the steroid stallion.

01:39.475 --> 01:42.842
What? Don't you have some
muscle-cocktail mixing to do?

01:43.020 --> 01:44.976
You ruined my life.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.229
And you don't even care, do you?

01:48.400 --> 01:52.518
Oh, please, if you didn't wanna get
Red Rovered by the Meteors...

01:52.696 --> 01:56.029
...maybe you should've reconsidered
jamming that needle into your tush.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.111
You're pretty quick
to get high and mighty.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.651
I think those aminos
are going to your head.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.036
And I think you've destroyed
enough lives.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.248
I'm not gonna let you destroy
any more.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.394
So I'm guessing you didn't ditch
prime time on your social calendar...

04:36.568 --> 04:39.651
...to come and help me research
the dwindling pigeon population.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.153
Chloe, Lex proposed.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.606
And?

04:46.578 --> 04:49.445
And I haven't given him an answer yet.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.699
I'm sure that's going over well.

04:54.544 --> 04:58.878
Yeah, Lex and I are in a really
great place right now...

05:00.217 --> 05:02.208
...but when I actually
heard those words...

05:02.386 --> 05:05.549
...there was something
that wouldn't let me say yes.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.723
Something like Clark?

05:13.897 --> 05:16.183
When I was with Clark...

05:16.358 --> 05:19.350
...I would've said yes without hesitating.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.898
I thought that chapter of my life
was over.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.654
Lana".

05:30.080 --> 05:33.493
...I think that you need to stop reading
between the lines...

05:33.667 --> 05:35.328
...and actually talk to Clark.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.915
Before you're gonna be able
to close this book on him forever.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.756
Let's go.

06:13.623 --> 06:17.161
-Scoopgirl?
-Hotshot485?

06:19.129 --> 06:20.790
You've gotta be kidding me.

06:20.964 --> 06:24.422
I'm not the one up all night tooling
the lntemet for Green Arrow pics.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.379
Don't you have a boyfriend?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.128
Do you have the photos?

06:30.015 --> 06:31.175
You got the cash?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.976
I don't get it. Of all
the photographers in Metropolis...

06:37.147 --> 06:40.230
...how is that you end up with
the ﬁrst shots of our merry archer?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.186
l have my connections.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.487
No, really.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.147
Oh, well, the guy doesn't get out
of the Suicide Slums much.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.486
So I just hung out there
for a few weeks.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.486
In my car, with my pepper spray,
and the doors locked—

06:53.663 --> 06:56.325
This is it?
A bunch of arms and legs?

06:57.125 --> 06:58.581
Nice work, hotshot.

06:58.752 --> 07:03.212
I mean, you didn't even manage
to catch one shot of his face.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.999
All these tell me about Green Arrow
is that he needs a Band-Aid.

07:11.807 --> 07:14.048
Well, at least you got a good look
at that.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.719
Thanks.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.355
Hey, Chloe.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.898
Have you seen the Daily Planet
this morning?

07:31.076 --> 07:32.236
No.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.534
Okay.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.616
God, I can't let you read this
in the paper.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.292
Lex proposed to Lana.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.129
What'd she say?

07:51.263 --> 07:53.219
She hasn't given him an answer.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.149
It says here it's because of me.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.896
This is true?

08:07.737 --> 08:08.726
Chloe?

08:12.868 --> 08:14.904
I know better—

08:17.330 --> 08:19.070
Look, I know better.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.791
You know, I tried so hard
to let Lana go that--

08:33.513 --> 08:37.051
If she marries Lex,
there's no going back.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.767
Is it true?

08:42.439 --> 08:46.853
I would double down on the fact
that Lana's still in love with you.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.279
-I can't let her do this.
-Clark, wait a minute.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.610
It's a lot more complicated now.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.117
What could be more complicated
than living your life with regrets?

09:20.936 --> 09:23.473
You didn't have to do that.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.811
l was feeling alone
waiting for your answer.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.479
I didn't realize I had so much company.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.158
I don't know what to say.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.824
Then let me.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.875
"When I was with Clark...

09:48.338 --> 09:51.045
...I would have said yes
without hesitating."

09:57.973 --> 10:00.385
You know, the worst part of waiting...

10:01.184 --> 10:05.018
...was dwelling on all the reasons
why you might be stalling.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.681
At least now I know.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.559
Lex, I'm sorry.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.697
Mr. Luthor, you have a guest.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.389
-They said Lana was here.
-She was.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.479
But I'm afraid you just missed her.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.860
I'll come back later.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.568
So you really think
you can convince her?

10:58.742 --> 11:00.949
You think you can talk her
out of making...

11:01.119 --> 11:03.576
...the biggest mistake of her life
by marrying me?

11:03.747 --> 11:07.456
-We both know that you swept in after--
-After you crushed her?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.454
You knew she was vulnerable.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.461
And you played her until she thought
she was in love with you.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.417
If you really see Lana as that naive...

11:15.592 --> 11:18.004
...you obviously
don't think as much of her as I do.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.795
It must be eating at you
that she's hesitating...

11:21.973 --> 11:25.261
...wondering why she hasn't
given you an answer.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.733
I guess it would.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.233
If I didn't know what the answer
was gonna be.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.489
You see, I highly doubt
she'll say no, Clark.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.910
Now that she's carrying my child.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.880
So you're telling me...

12:05.058 --> 12:08.266
...you think that Metropolis' most
worshipped meathead was murdered?

12:08.812 --> 12:11.645
Hey, now, that's my childhood hero
you're talking smack about.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.352
And the one baseball card
I still can't manage to snag.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.016
{SHIRE

12:16.194 --> 12:17.525
Yeah, it's an investment.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.108
So why the homicide hunch on this guy?

12:21.282 --> 12:23.864
The obit writer left me
Dawson's ﬁle to scan his photo.

12:24.035 --> 12:27.448
Preliminary investigation's
calling it suicide but...

12:27.622 --> 12:30.659
...how's a guy who's larger than life
drown in two feet of water?

12:30.834 --> 12:32.870
Well, his career was over...

12:33.044 --> 12:35.501
...and Lake was right,
the coroner's report says...

12:35.672 --> 12:37.583
...Dawson was juiced up
on muscle mixers.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.715
Chloe, come on. You're gonna tell me
that someone on roid rage...

12:40.885 --> 12:43.422
...is gonna lie down in a koi pond
and call it a day?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.011
You said you'd have it ready by today.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.851
Well, that was before you added
the Zen waterfall.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.606
I have to get approval.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.645
Approval? Oh, please. This pulp rag
lives or dies by my column.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.438
Now, you get it done by today...

13:03.616 --> 13:06.528
...or you're gonna be decorating
bathrooms in strip malls.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.655
Get out!

13:19.549 --> 13:21.005
Mr. Luthor...

13:21.176 --> 13:24.134
...now, there's only one reason
a celebrity pays me a house call.

13:25.597 --> 13:26.882
Right to the point.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.380
Since you have a unique way
of exhuming...

13:29.559 --> 13:31.550
...even the most carefully buried
secrets...

13:31.728 --> 13:33.935
...l have a little freelance
assignment for you.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.767
I quit doing freelance
when I quit fetching lattes...

13:36.941 --> 13:39.728
...for pudgy-ﬁngered newsroom vultures.

13:39.903 --> 13:43.111
Well, I'll let you decide
what it's worth to you.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.571
Fill in whatever number you want.

13:45.742 --> 13:49.701
Just get me anything you can
on Clark Kent and Lana Lang.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.580
Okay, how long do I have to do this for?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.714
What was it you said?

14:03.885 --> 14:06.251
"Yoga's gloriﬁed stretching
with chants."

14:06.429 --> 14:08.215
A different perspective
from down here.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.756
Yeah, well, this is a good way
to strengthen your core, trust me.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.180
I didn't realize that my core
was in question.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.857
You really wanna keep talking?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.606
No.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.955
Oh, it's a scratch. Don't worry about it.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.048
A scratch?

14:46.344 --> 14:47.550
How did that happen?

14:49.847 --> 14:53.089
-It was a fencing accident.
-With a real blade?

14:54.727 --> 14:57.343
You know, the tip snapped off
and caught me.

14:57.522 --> 15:00.480
Trust me, it looks worse than it feels,
okay?

15:00.650 --> 15:02.481
I promise.

15:03.528 --> 15:08.318
Thank you for all of the chakra
reorganizing, but I have to go.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.027
Well—

15:11.578 --> 15:13.034
Goodbye.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.363
Smallville. Sorry about the article.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.444
It's bad enough to have
a broken heart...

15:52.619 --> 15:54.951
...but to have it splashed
all over the newspapers.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.157
I guess that's what reporters do,
don't they?

15:57.332 --> 16:01.871
Okay, I think that little zingerjust
ricocheted off Linda Lake and hit me.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.203
Look, I'm sorry.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.796
It's just people keep secrets
for a reason.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.252
I don't know.

16:09.427 --> 16:12.760
If you ask me, I think a secret is
just a big loophole...

16:12.930 --> 16:15.182
...in the whole "Thou shall not lie"
clause.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.095
There's just no gray area
with you, is there?

16:18.269 --> 16:20.806
Not when someone I thought I knew
better than anyone...

16:20.980 --> 16:23.517
...has been keeping
the biggest secret of all.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.185
What are you talking about?

16:25.360 --> 16:29.399
What would you do if one day you
realized someone close to you...

16:29.572 --> 16:32.655
...had a serious hero complex?

16:34.369 --> 16:35.358
Hero complex?

16:35.536 --> 16:40.246
Hiding his true identity from everyone
he supposedly cares about.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.579
You can't tell me you wouldn't ﬁnd
something wrong with that.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.541
Who exactly are we talking about?

16:47.715 --> 16:51.003
Green Arrow, a.k.a. Oliver Queen.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.800
Oliver.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.963
Jimmy snapped photos of Green Arrow...

16:57.141 --> 17:01.100
...getting slashed in the arm
exactly where Ollie's arm is cut.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.397
Plus, the time printed on the photos...

17:03.564 --> 17:08.558
...is exactly the same time Ollie
disappeared on me that same night.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.614
When are you planning to unload
this theory on Oliver?

17:16.244 --> 17:19.532
I need proof ﬁrst. Deﬁnitive proof.

17:20.081 --> 17:22.697
That's where I thought
you might come in handy.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.891
I swear I'm losing my scare reﬂex
because of you.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.177
-Lois asked me--
-Oh, please, Clark.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.597
Are you gonna tell me why you're
digging in Lois' purse, Snoop Dogg?

17:48.234 --> 17:52.944
Wait, let me guess. You're covering for
the new pledge of your hero fraternity.

17:53.114 --> 17:56.277
Last time Lois said she had a lead
on Green Arrow, she was blufﬁng.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.487
She says Jimmy has shots
that'd help ID him.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.824
Jimmy?
He's moonlighting for Lois?

18:01.998 --> 18:04.080
I guess we all have secrets to keep.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.164
You should know that better
than anyone right now.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.592
You knew that Lana was pregnant,
didn't you?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.299
Clark.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.338
Before you unload your anger on me...

18:20.516 --> 18:23.132
...can I just say that I think
it is incredibly unfair...

18:23.311 --> 18:25.677
...that everyone trusts me
to keep their secrets...

18:25.855 --> 18:28.312
...then they turn around
and they throw me attitude...

18:28.483 --> 18:30.189
...for keeping someone else's secret.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.647
Look, I'm sorry that I had to take
a two-second breather...

18:33.821 --> 18:36.858
...from hiding the fact that
you're an alien from another planet...

18:37.033 --> 18:38.864
...to protect someone else
for a change.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.867
God.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.351
You had that coming, you know.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.641
For the record...

19:14.654 --> 19:18.647
...I prefer "intergalactic traveler"
over "alien from another planet."

19:47.270 --> 19:48.760
Hey.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.641
Hey.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.932
Thanks for ﬁnally returning
one of my phone calls.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.065
How much does Lana Lang's
personal life...

19:58.239 --> 20:00.446
...boost newspaper sales these days?

20:01.784 --> 20:04.116
Okay. I was expecting that.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.614
But to be honest, I was kind of hoping
you'd give me the beneﬁt of the doubt.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.119
I guess there's a shortage
of those today.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.707
That article recites our conversation
verbatim.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.167
Do you honestly think
I'd betray you like that?

20:17.341 --> 20:19.297
What other explanation is there?

20:19.468 --> 20:21.299
I'm not sure,
but the Lana Lang I know...

20:21.470 --> 20:24.507
...would at least give me a chance
to ﬁnd one.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.308
After Clark, I guess I'm so jaded...

20:30.479 --> 20:33.346
...I don't even know what to expect
from my friends anymore.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.021
So I take it the conversation
didn't go so well.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.856
Conversation?

20:40.489 --> 20:43.652
-Clark left the Talon to go talk to you.
-About what?

20:44.160 --> 20:45.741
Well—

20:46.662 --> 20:47.868
I don't—

20:49.332 --> 20:51.539
I should just put a bag over my head
that says:

20:51.709 --> 20:54.041
"If you wanna keep a secret,
don't tell me."

20:55.838 --> 20:57.703
What did he wanna say?

20:57.882 --> 21:00.248
You two need to OK. Corral it
on your own.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.918
I've been blamed for putting words
in people's mouths enough for one day.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.430
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.851
I don't understand
how every intimate detail of my life...

21:13.022 --> 21:15.513
...is being leaked
into Linda Lake's column.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.104
From what I found out,
her reconnaissance techniques...

21:19.278 --> 21:21.690
...aren't exactly from the
Journalist Code of Ethics.

21:23.491 --> 21:26.699
I think it's time we turn the tables
on our little resident voyeur.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.165
Hey, I got your call. What's the 911?

21:35.336 --> 21:36.542
I've been thinking.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.873
Maybe your Oliver theory
isn't so far out there.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.630
If he is the Green Arrow,
you deserve to know the truth.

21:41.801 --> 21:46.170
Really? Because I've been doing
some thinking of my own...

21:46.347 --> 21:48.053
...and maybe I don't wanna know.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.636
I went through the articles
on Green Arrow's crimes.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.721
What if we just got off
on the wrong foot?

21:52.895 --> 21:55.227
The rob-from-the-rich-
to-give-to-the-poor thing...

21:55.398 --> 21:57.889
-...that wins him some points.
-Are you feeling okay?

21:58.067 --> 22:01.730
No, I'm not all right, Clark.
I think I'm in love with Oliver.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.563
I don't know how you ever
let Lana go if you felt this way...

22:05.741 --> 22:09.199
...because I swear the guy could tell me
he was from Mars right now...

22:09.370 --> 22:12.737
...and I would ﬁnd a way to dismiss it
as an endearing quirk.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.241
Lois, you're like a pit bull on a pant leg.

22:16.419 --> 22:19.456
You're never gonna let this go
until you know for sure.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.841
I hate that you know me like that.

22:24.010 --> 22:28.754
But I can'tjust pull a Lois
and ambush him. What if I'm wrong?

22:30.433 --> 22:32.594
What if you never need to confront him?

22:42.278 --> 22:45.111
Isn't this exciting?
Our ﬁrst group movie night?

22:45.281 --> 22:48.068
I mean, don't you just love spontaneity?

22:49.285 --> 22:54.245
Let me get it.
Clark. Come on in.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.622
Let me get yourjacket.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.704
Thanks for having me over.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.294
Lois, looks like you went all out.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.627
Well, it's not a party until—

23:06.093 --> 23:08.470
Oh, no. I can't believe I did that.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.129
You can't have cocktails without ice.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.760
Don't worry, yours will be virgin.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.016
You know what,
I'll run to the corner, I can--

23:16.187 --> 23:19.520
No. No, I got it. My party, my bad.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.189
You think she suspects anything?

23:27.406 --> 23:30.819
-She's a little preoccupied.
-Then it's showtime.

23:42.797 --> 23:44.333
Oliver...

23:44.548 --> 23:46.004
...they're chasing me.

23:46.175 --> 23:48.712
I don't know how many there are,
10 maybe.

23:48.886 --> 23:51.218
I shouldn't have cut down the alley.

23:52.598 --> 23:56.216
Oh, my God, Oliver. Help me.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.936
Good one, Lois.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.351
Need some help?

24:16.038 --> 24:18.404
You didn't tell me
there was gonna be real thugs.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.573
They kind of made
an impromptu appearance.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.548
Let her go.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.646
Let's go! Come on, come on!

24:57.913 --> 25:00.575
Your secret's safe with me, Oliver.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.626
-You're--
-A hell of a thank you.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.650
Did you just call him Oliver?

25:30.613 --> 25:34.197
It was just a hunch.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.129
All right, Lana,
you ready for your close-up?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.382
I can't believe this is so easy.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.464
Okay. How are my pearly
megapixels looking?

25:57.264 --> 25:59.596
Crystal clear.
Since we're eavesdropping...

25:59.767 --> 26:02.383
...can you ﬁnd out what else she has
on Lex and me?

26:02.561 --> 26:06.179
Yeah, sure.
Do a little recon while we're at it.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.312
Chloe, what is it?

26:12.071 --> 26:13.356
Clark....

26:15.032 --> 26:17.193
Like tomorrow's headline?

26:17.785 --> 26:20.868
And here I thought your hatred
was just professional jealousy.

26:21.038 --> 26:24.872
Who knew you were covering
such a scandalous secret?

26:25.042 --> 26:27.704
You're actually gonna stake your
reputation...

26:27.878 --> 26:31.166
...on this tabloid garbage
that's not even ﬁt for the Inquisitor?

26:31.340 --> 26:33.001
Nobody's gonna believe you.

26:33.175 --> 26:37.339
Oh, of course they will.
I have a very trustworthy source.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.502
You.

26:39.807 --> 26:42.514
And, no doubt, if anyone
goes looking for proof...

26:42.685 --> 26:44.721
...well, I think they're gonna ﬁnd it.

26:46.021 --> 26:50.606
But I must say, I am impressed.
Here you were, sitting on a story...

26:50.776 --> 26:53.108
...that could have earned you
a major headline.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.519
You chose to protect your friend instead.

26:55.698 --> 26:58.861
Not a hard decision to make
when you actually care about someone.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.901
It's values like that that keep
your career in the basement.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.205
Don't you just love the Internet?

27:08.794 --> 27:13.709
Did you know,
with just one touch of a button...

27:14.466 --> 27:17.458
...I can be on every major talk show?

27:17.636 --> 27:20.719
And everyone at YouTube
will know that your farm-boy friend...

27:20.889 --> 27:23.221
...is really an--

27:28.272 --> 27:29.387
--alien.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.430
Your credibility might be at stake...

27:31.608 --> 27:33.735
...when you're locked up
for Dawson's murder.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.813
Mike Dawson drowned.
Do your homework.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.569
It's in every police report.

27:37.740 --> 27:41.403
Most police aren't from Smallville.
You remember Smallville, don't you?

27:41.577 --> 27:44.068
You were a rookie reporter
for KSCW...

27:44.246 --> 27:46.407
...who went for the second
meteor shower.

27:46.582 --> 27:48.163
Moth got too close to the ﬂame...

27:48.334 --> 27:50.825
...and your news van took
a nosedive into Crater Lake.

27:51.003 --> 27:54.416
My guess is you walked out
with some sort of special ability.

27:54.590 --> 27:58.253
From what I found out, Mike Dawson
wasn't your ﬁrst victim, was he?

27:58.427 --> 28:00.964
Nobody likes an overachiever.

28:10.439 --> 28:11.849
Hey, Sullivan.

29:07.871 --> 29:11.159
You wanna rise above sea level,
you better sharpen those teeth.

29:20.634 --> 29:26.630
-Oh, my God, she came out of nowhere.
-lt's okay. She's gone now.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.615
Yes.

29:54.460 --> 29:58.078
Hey, how are the secret adventures
of Lois and Jimmy?

29:58.255 --> 30:00.041
Busted.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.291
Oh, my God, what happened
to your face?

30:03.469 --> 30:05.926
You should see the other guy.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.388
Who did that to you?

30:10.559 --> 30:13.801
You can put your dueling pistol away.
It was just a workplace scufﬂe.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.765
You were right about Lake.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.723
Looks like we're two-for-two tonight.

30:21.904 --> 30:24.862
I wanted you to be the ﬁrst one
to take a look at this.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.488
Check it out.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.445
Green Arrow.
I got real pictures of him.

30:29.620 --> 30:32.407
Face and all.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.905
And this one's not yet rated.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.411
| feel dirty.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.170
Think about how Oliver feels.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.297
Lois and Clark put this
scheme together...

30:44.468 --> 30:46.584
...because they thought Oliver
was Green Arrow.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.548
Poor sucker comes around the corner...

30:48.722 --> 30:51.259
...catches her sucking lip
with leather daddy.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.093
This, this is the real money shot.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.182
Get ready to meet the Green Arrow.

31:01.401 --> 31:04.985
No. No, no, this is not happening.

31:05.155 --> 31:08.113
I had his face in the crosshairs.
How could he be there...

31:08.283 --> 31:10.444
...and then just gone like the '90s?

31:11.662 --> 31:15.621
Gone as in "faster than a thousandth
of a second" shutter speed?

31:17.042 --> 31:19.454
Yeah. Weird.

31:19.836 --> 31:23.294
| always thought he was super-cool.
I didn't realize he was superhuman.

31:30.639 --> 31:33.346
-Clark.
-What's going on?

31:33.934 --> 31:37.176
Lois was just telling me
about her exciting night last night.

31:37.354 --> 31:40.562
Yeah, I don't know where you
disappeared to last night, Smallville.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.393
Turns out
l was wrong about Oliver.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.980
He's not the Green Arrow,
can you believe that?

31:45.153 --> 31:48.566
And luckily Oliver showed up
when our hero was still around...

31:48.740 --> 31:50.992
...but looks like you were
way off base about him.

31:51.159 --> 31:56.028
And the craziest part is he chucked
a guy across an alley, right?

31:56.206 --> 31:59.323
-Oh, yeah.
-And then super-sped away.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.708
I mean, who does that?

32:09.553 --> 32:12.465
It's good Oliver showed up when he did,
then you knew for sure.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.721
Oh, she knew before he showed up.

32:15.017 --> 32:16.006
You did?

32:17.519 --> 32:19.020
Ask her how.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.178
How?

32:21.356 --> 32:22.516
I kissed him.

32:24.693 --> 32:26.183
Isn't that romantic?

32:30.365 --> 32:32.356
Oh, I'm sorry, Lois. Finish the story.

32:35.537 --> 32:37.619
This is the best part.

32:38.540 --> 32:41.577
Well, he was holding me in his arms...

32:41.752 --> 32:45.870
...and Ollie's a good kisser,
don't get me wrong.

32:47.215 --> 32:48.876
But that Green Arrow...

32:49.051 --> 32:51.292
...he could teach Ollie a thing or two.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.615
Hey.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.565
You took off early last night.
You okay?

33:18.205 --> 33:21.914
| just keep running what happened
through my head.

33:23.919 --> 33:27.286
Lana, you can't blame yourself.
It wasn't your fault.

33:28.048 --> 33:30.585
That part I'm pretty clear on.

33:32.594 --> 33:34.926
Look, nobody wanted to see her die...

33:35.097 --> 33:37.383
...but if you hadn't come
when you did...

33:37.557 --> 33:40.890
...it would've been my obit
on the front page.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.346
Maybe.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.477
Of section D.

33:47.567 --> 33:51.606
Anyway, thank you. Again.

33:55.909 --> 33:57.740
How do you do that?

33:58.245 --> 34:01.487
Just brush it under the rug
as if nothing happened?

34:03.959 --> 34:07.952
Lana, Linda wasn't the ﬁrst
freak of nature who went psycho.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.795
No.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.960
I mean, whatever it is
you're protecting about Clark.

34:18.473 --> 34:21.180
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.262
Yes, you do.

34:24.479 --> 34:27.312
Some secret about a farm boy?

34:27.482 --> 34:31.566
Made you take a hammer to her
computer before I could hear the rest.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.401
Come on, Chloe, I'm not that naive.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.989
Whatever it is you two
have been hiding...

34:39.161 --> 34:42.369
...do you really expect me
to keep looking the other way?

34:47.169 --> 34:48.875
Linda was grasping at straws.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.036
She's always desperate
for her next story...

34:51.214 --> 34:53.330
...you know that better than anyone.

34:57.262 --> 34:58.798
Lana.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.847
I would never do anything to hurt you.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.775
That's what Clark always says.

35:42.182 --> 35:45.015
I'm sorry that you had to ﬁnd out
like this.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.732
It's okay.

35:56.196 --> 35:59.233
You don't have to tell me
every little detail of your life anymore.

36:03.995 --> 36:08.910
Clark, we both know that a proposal
is more than a little...

36:09.084 --> 36:10.415
...detail.

36:12.462 --> 36:15.078
And as messed up as it is...

36:16.049 --> 36:19.257
...you were the ﬁrst person
that I wanted to tell.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.754
Is that supposed to make me
feel better?

36:24.933 --> 36:27.970
Clark, you said that
you didn't love me anymore.

36:28.770 --> 36:32.604
And I tried to out everything off,
but I'm not made that way.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.351
Even if we're not talking...

36:37.529 --> 36:40.316
...you are still a part of my life.

36:41.658 --> 36:44.115
And I'm not trying to deny it anymore.

36:44.286 --> 36:46.777
I am trying to put it into perspective.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.915
I guess we both need to do that.

36:59.217 --> 37:03.256
Chloe said that you came by
to talk to me.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.259
What was it about?

37:12.480 --> 37:17.270
Whatever secret Chloe is helping you
to protect, Clark...

37:18.820 --> 37:20.481
...please...

37:20.739 --> 37:22.525
...just once....

37:28.788 --> 37:30.699
Just trust me.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.329
Doesn't matter now.

37:40.008 --> 37:41.999
Clark, don't do that.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.804
I know about the baby.

37:53.146 --> 37:55.011
Lex told me.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.435
Everything's changed.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.730
Even the fact that you told me...

38:04.908 --> 38:08.196
...that you look back at the past
and regret it every day?

38:09.955 --> 38:12.037
Has that changed too?

38:18.797 --> 38:22.289
I guess that I can't ask you
to see me the same way.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.005
Lana.

38:36.523 --> 38:39.390
I hope Lex makes you very happy.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.965
A million dollars for your thoughts.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.473
Sorry.

39:17.647 --> 39:21.686
My comic timing is the ﬁrst to go
after my nerves.

39:24.154 --> 39:26.236
You know, in all my life...

39:26.948 --> 39:30.156
...l've never made an offer
when l was afraid of the answer...

39:33.371 --> 39:34.827
...till now.

39:37.751 --> 39:40.618
You have been so patient.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.880
Doesn't feel like it.

39:53.016 --> 39:54.972
I went to see Clark.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.260
And?

40:02.358 --> 40:04.770
And I love him.

40:08.865 --> 40:14.030
I love both of you
and maybe I always will.

40:18.166 --> 40:22.830
Lex, I couldn't say yes to you, knowing
that I might look back with regrets.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.165
You deserve better than that.

40:33.389 --> 40:36.005
Lana, with the life I've led...

40:36.726 --> 40:40.514
...I go to bed praying every night
that I don't get what I deserve.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.221
You get bitter...

40:44.317 --> 40:46.148
...and vengeful.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.532
And then you meet someone...

40:53.493 --> 40:55.324
...who's so good...

40:57.705 --> 41:00.868
...that she might be the one person
who could learn to love you.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.874
I would wait forever for that.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.379
You don't have to.

41:14.013 --> 41:16.425
I'm done looking back.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.725
l have someone right in front of me...

41:20.895 --> 41:24.479
...who I know trusts me...

41:26.568 --> 41:30.732
...and who lets me see sides of him
no one else does.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.902
So just for clariﬁcation....

41:42.208 --> 41:44.824
Yes, Lex Luthor.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.586
I will marry you.

42:35.637 --> 42:37.628
