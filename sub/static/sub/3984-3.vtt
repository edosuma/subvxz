02:50.920 --> 02:53.844
Valar Morghulis.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.127
Valar Dohaeris.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.530
I've been sweeping this floor for days.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.647
Good.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.609
I didn't come here to sweep floors.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.007
No? Why come, then?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.525
You said I could be your apprentice.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.651
You said you'd teach me
how to be a Faceless Man.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.689
A man teaches a girl.

03:52.680 --> 03:56.890
Valar Dohaeris. All men must serve.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.042
Faceless Men most of all.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.006
I want to serve.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.082
A girl wants to serve herself.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.288
Here we serve the Many-Faced God.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.850
To serve well,

04:12.520 --> 04:14.488
a girl must become no one.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.130
Which one's the Many-Faced God?

04:17.040 --> 04:21.523
I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God.
I see the weirwood face.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.001
There is only one god.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.241
A girl knows his name.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.967
And all men know his gift.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.602
Where are they taking him?

05:26.160 --> 05:30.643
- Queen Margaery!
- Queen Margaery!

05:35.600 --> 05:37.568
Queen Margaery!

05:39.560 --> 05:41.722
Queen Margaery!

05:42.240 --> 05:43.287
Queen Margaery!

05:48.600 --> 05:51.649
- I am his and he is mine.
- I am hers and she is mine.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.122
From this day until the end of my days.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.850
Did I hurt you?

06:40.960 --> 06:43.327
No. You were lovely.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.643
- It all happened so fast.
- Yes.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.000
I was scared maybe I hurt you.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.085
- It sounded like...
- No, no, no.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.650
You're very sweet.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.005
The sweetest king who ever lived.

06:56.680 --> 07:00.924
This is all I want to do all day,
every day, for the rest of my life.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.680
Wouldn't that be glorious?

07:05.240 --> 07:06.890
Shouldn't we rest a little while?

07:06.960 --> 07:09.770
Just to catch our breath?
There's no rush, is there?

07:09.840 --> 07:10.966
Of course not.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.566
Are you hungry?

07:13.640 --> 07:16.086
Should I have them bring you
some cake or pomegranate juice?

07:16.160 --> 07:18.083
No, I'm fine.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.004
I just want you all to myself.

07:21.080 --> 07:26.849
I want to know everything there is to know
about King Tommen, First of His Name.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.649
King Tommen.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.604
Still sounds strange to me.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.769
Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?

07:35.360 --> 07:37.601
So strange.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.603
- Husband.
- Wife.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.967
Sometimes it feels odd.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.644
I'm the king,

07:46.720 --> 07:50.008
I've married the most
beautiful woman in the world,

07:51.040 --> 07:52.485
and it's all because my brother died.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.003
I understand.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.363
But it's not your fault.
You know that, don't you?

07:59.440 --> 08:01.204
You mustn't feel guilty.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.249
I don't feel guilty.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.565
That's what's odd.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.206
Do you like to sail?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.201
I love to sail.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.522
I do, too.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.571
I think we're going to be very happy,
you and I.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.651
I do, too.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.491
Living in a tower
so high it touches the clouds.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.524
Of course, my grandmother
couldn't wait to go home.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.206
The capital's not for everyone, I suppose.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.408
Does your mother like it here?

08:40.559 --> 08:42.049
I don't think so.

08:42.159 --> 08:44.447
She told me
never to trust anyone in King's Landing.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.923
It's so wonderful
to have her watching over you.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.128
A lioness guarding her cub.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.647
Well, but I'm a man now.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.211
You are.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.285
And the king.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.690
But you'll always be her baby boy.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.205
I suppose.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.960
I adore her. She's always been
so generous with me, so kind.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.088
And the horrors she's had to endure...

09:17.760 --> 09:20.969
Losing her husband,
her eldest child, and her father.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.651
It's no wonder she's so protective of you.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.451
She'll never let you out of her sight.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.928
You look very much in love.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.287
The first days of marriage
are often so blissful.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.130
She's certainly very pretty, isn't she?

09:38.200 --> 09:41.170
Like a doll. She smiles quite a lot.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.082
Do you think she's intelligent?

09:45.800 --> 09:47.564
I can't quite tell.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.760
Not that it matters.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.410
Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

09:51.480 --> 09:53.608
There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.890
That's where you grew up.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.882
You always told me
that you liked the people there better.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.929
You said that King's Landing
smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.129
Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?

10:09.640 --> 10:12.041
The way that you talked about it,

10:12.120 --> 10:14.407
I always thought that you missed it.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.130
That you...

10:16.200 --> 10:17.201
That it was your real home.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.409
This is my real home now,
where my family lives.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.888
I want you to be happy, Mother.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.565
I know that.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.645
I know you do. My sweet boy.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.802
But wouldn't you be happier
in Casterly Rock?

10:35.560 --> 10:38.928
I said,
"Darling, surely four times is enough.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.889
"Are you trying to set a new record?"

10:40.960 --> 10:44.567
He said, "Well, what is the record?
I'm sure we can break it."

10:50.080 --> 10:51.570
Mother.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.491
Welcome.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.370
Don't you look lovely?
Marriage agrees with you.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.171
Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?

11:00.240 --> 11:03.050
I wish we had some wine for you.
It's a bit early in the day for us.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.001
No, no, I can't stay.

11:08.920 --> 11:13.687
I just wanted to let you know
if there's ever anything I can do for you...

11:13.760 --> 11:15.683
You are very sweet.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.762
Tommen seems quite taken
with his new queen.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.446
I absolutely adore him.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.043
You raised a gallant young man.
I'm forever grateful.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.491
Good.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.246
Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.766
Ecstatic. I really am.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.604
Exhausted, to be honest.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.969
But what could I expect?
He is half lion, half stag.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.529
I'll leave you to it, then.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.563
Oh, forgive me.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.160
I haven't been at court for long.
I get so confused.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.402
What's the proper way to address you now?

11:48.520 --> 11:50.841
Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

11:52.680 --> 11:54.409
There's no need for such formalities.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.962
In any event,
judging from the king's enthusiasm,

11:58.040 --> 12:00.088
the Queen Mother will be
a Queen Grandmother soon.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.764
Won't that be a lovely day?

12:01.840 --> 12:05.890
Can you imagine the celebrations?
They'll ring the bells all day and night.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.644
Remember,

12:08.840 --> 12:11.047
anything you need.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.331
We can't hold the North
with terror alone.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.926
You can't hold the North
if you let these lesser lords insult us.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.651
I sent you there to collect taxes,
not bodies.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.610
Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.041
Said the Warden of the North
would always be a Stark,

13:39.120 --> 13:41.691
and he'd be damned
if he'd kiss a traitor's boot.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.482
He left you no choice.

13:46.560 --> 13:50.451
I flayed him living,
along with his wife and brother.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.488
Made his son watch.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.041
And?

13:55.120 --> 13:57.441
The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.442
I've something important to tell you.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.761
Stop eating and listen.

14:18.960 --> 14:23.363
We don't have enough men to hold the North
if the other houses rise up against us.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.726
Do you understand that?

14:24.840 --> 14:26.365
Our pact with the Lannisters protects...

14:26.440 --> 14:28.442
I had a pact with Tywin Lannister.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.887
And Tywin Lannister is dead.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.964
The remaining Lannisters are a thousand
miles away dealing with that fact.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.847
They've never once,
in the history of the Seven Kingdoms,

14:36.920 --> 14:38.843
sent their army this far north.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.002
If you think they will for us,
you're a fool.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.402
We've become a great house by entering
into alliances with other houses,

14:46.480 --> 14:49.768
and parlaying those alliances
into greater power.

14:49.840 --> 14:54.880
The best way to forge a lasting alliance
isn't by peeling a man's skin off.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.450
The best way is marriage.

14:57.800 --> 15:01.247
Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree,

15:01.320 --> 15:04.051
it's high time you married a suitable bride.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.164
And as it happens,

15:09.240 --> 15:12.483
I've found the perfect girl
to solidify our hold on the North.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.125
That's Moat Cailin.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.647
Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

15:39.720 --> 15:41.961
You've been here before?

15:42.040 --> 15:46.045
On our way down to King's Landing
with my father and Arya.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.041
Where are you taking me?

15:48.120 --> 15:49.645
Home.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.244
The Boltons have Winterfell.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.281
Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you.

16:00.640 --> 16:01.641
No.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.324
Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.925
He did.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.889
He serves the Lannisters.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.325
For now.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.687
- I won't go.
- Winterfell is your home.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.240
- Not anymore.
- Always.

16:17.320 --> 16:20.324
You're a Stark.
Dying your hair doesn't change that.

16:20.400 --> 16:25.247
You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.651
Your place is in the North.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.884
I can't marry him. You can't make me.
He is a traitor. A murderer!

16:30.960 --> 16:32.928
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.447
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir, Ramsay.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.369
One day he'll be Warden of the North
and you...

16:38.440 --> 16:39.726
- No.
- Sansa.

16:39.800 --> 16:44.522
No, you can't make me. I will starve myself.
I will die before I have to go there.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.888
I won't force you to do anything.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.566
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

16:51.440 --> 16:53.966
Say the word and we turn the horses around,
but listen to me.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.644
Listen.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.809
You've been running all your life.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.851
Terrible things happen to your family
and you weep.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.049
You sit alone in a darkened room
mourning their fates.

17:05.119 --> 17:09.522
You've been a bystander to tragedy
from the day they executed your father.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.171
Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.445
Stop running.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.961
There's no justice in the world.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.249
Not unless we make it.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.723
You loved your family.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.487
Avenge them.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.885
Banners!

18:31.200 --> 18:32.770
How do we get through there?

18:32.880 --> 18:34.006
We don't.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.970
We go around.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.520
Takes us miles out of the way.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.840
We'll lose sight of them.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.969
Doesn't matter.
I know where they're going.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.281
Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire?

18:53.600 --> 18:55.568
How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

18:56.400 --> 18:57.447
He hates that nickname.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.887
Well, he's not here to complain about it,
is he?

19:04.600 --> 19:08.241
I squired for a knight named Ser Lorimer
during the War of the Five Kings.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.483
One night, he had a bit too much to drink,

19:11.560 --> 19:14.166
and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.321
He borrowed it?

19:15.400 --> 19:16.686
He wasn't a thief.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.041
He was drunk, and hungry,
and he wasn't thinking.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.368
I was drunk, too.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.487
He gave me half the ham.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.646
Next morning,
one of the guards saw him passed out

19:29.040 --> 19:31.691
under a wagon
with the hambone still in his hand.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.729
They hanged him that afternoon.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.280
They tied the noose for me, too,

19:37.720 --> 19:40.405
but Lord Tywin heard
my family name was Payne,

19:40.480 --> 19:41.766
so he pardoned me,

19:41.840 --> 19:44.320
and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.722
As punishment for both of you.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.689
It didn't seem that way.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.524
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.921
Yes, all your lords have
been very kind to you.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.684
All except me.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.127
Sorry, you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.282
I'm not sorry.
You're the best fighter I've ever seen.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.845
You beat the Hound.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.002
I'm proud to be your squire.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.281
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.681
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.561
You want to be a knight, Pod?

20:22.720 --> 20:23.721
Yes.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.565
Starting tomorrow,
we'll train with the sword twice a day,

20:26.640 --> 20:29.246
before we ride in the morning
and after you make camp in the evening.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.044
And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.121
Thank you.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.601
I can't knight you,
but I can teach you how to fight.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.523
I suppose that's more important.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.202
You weren't a knight,

20:52.280 --> 20:55.045
but you were a Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

20:56.240 --> 20:57.605
I was.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.001
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.520
He was.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.804
How did you end up serving Renly?

21:13.480 --> 21:16.211
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.966
I'm his only living child,
so he wanted to make a good match for me.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.611
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.490
I didn't want to go,
but he dragged me to the ballroom.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.643
And it was wonderful.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.601
None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.648
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

21:39.720 --> 21:42.007
when they thought it was
their turn to dance.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.449
They whispered in my ear

21:45.520 --> 21:49.161
how they wanted to marry me
and take me back to their castles.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.523
My father smiled at me, and I smiled at him.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.287
I had never been so happy.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.881
Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.365
And then they all started to laugh.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.489
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.244
They were toying with me.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.281
"Brienne the Beauty," they called me.
Great joke.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.527
And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.450
A great lumbering beast.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.766
I tried to run away,
but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.450
"Don't let them see your tears," he told me.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.363
"They're nasty little shits,

22:40.440 --> 22:43.330
"and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

22:44.680 --> 22:46.887
He danced with me,
and none of the other boys could say a word.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.128
Renly was the king's brother after all.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.404
But wasn't he...

22:57.480 --> 22:59.244
Lord Tyrion said he was...

23:01.200 --> 23:03.123
Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.889
He didn't love me. He didn't want me.

23:05.960 --> 23:09.681
He danced with me because he was kind,
and didn't want to see me hurt.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.644
He saved me from being a joke.

23:13.720 --> 23:17.281
From that day until his last day.

23:19.880 --> 23:22.247
And I couldn't save him in return.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.401
Nothing's more hateful
than failing to protect the one you love.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.682
One day I will avenge King Renly.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.607
But you said a shadow murdered him.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.727
How do you fight a shadow?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.287
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.646
I know it was Stannis.
I know it in my heart.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.842
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

23:52.680 --> 23:56.526
And a man can be killed.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.441
- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.363
I'd like to speak alone.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.681
Olly is my steward now,

24:05.760 --> 24:08.047
as I was Lord Commander Mormont's.

24:08.680 --> 24:12.526
I want him to attend my meetings
to learn from men with experience.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.728
One day he might command.

24:20.360 --> 24:21.361
Very well.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.608
Have you considered my offer?

24:25.080 --> 24:26.286
I have.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.448
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.961
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.605
Say the word and you will be.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.330
But I have to refuse you.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.406
I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.131
My place is here.

24:43.200 --> 24:46.090
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

24:47.120 --> 24:49.691
to take back the castle where you grew up.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.842
To rule the North.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.241
I wish I could fight beside you.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.209
Believe me, I do.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.409
But I swore a sacred vow at the godswood.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.610
I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.603
You're as stubborn as your father.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.601
And as honorable.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.845
I can imagine no higher praise.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.081
I didn't mean it as praise.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.564
Honor got your father killed.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.443
But if your mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

25:17.520 --> 25:20.842
May I ask how long you plan
to stay at Castle Black?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.490
Are you bored of us already?

25:24.040 --> 25:27.442
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.
We will never forget that.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.690
But it's a question of survival.

25:29.760 --> 25:32.411
The Night's Watch can't continue
to feed your men

25:32.480 --> 25:35.211
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.361
Winter is coming.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.645
I know it.

25:40.720 --> 25:44.930
We march on Winterfell within the fortnight,
before the snows trap us here.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.366
And the wildlings?

25:47.480 --> 25:49.642
If they'd rather burn than fight for me,
so be it.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.960
I leave their fate to you.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.044
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.129
Or you could see if this Tormund fellow

26:01.200 --> 26:03.851
is more willing to compromise
than Mance ever was.

26:03.920 --> 26:07.288
I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch
would rather see the wildlings dead.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.249
Most of the brothers, yes.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.961
There's little love for the free folk here.

26:13.040 --> 26:16.647
You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.764
You have many enemies in Castle Black.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.844
Have you considered
sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere?

26:24.280 --> 26:26.806
Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.247
I heard it was best
to keep your enemies close.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.641
Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.330
He sees something in you.

26:42.960 --> 26:46.851
Might not be apparent from his tone,
but it's the truth.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.206
He believes in you.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.448
I'm sorry I disappointed him.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.688
The king is a complicated man,

26:57.960 --> 27:00.281
but he wants to do what's right
for the Seven Kingdoms.

27:00.360 --> 27:01.725
As long as he's ruling them.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.529
He's the one true king.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.169
He has a blood right to that throne.

27:06.240 --> 27:09.926
I've sworn to stay clear of the politics
of the Seven Kingdoms.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.240
Have you now?

27:14.520 --> 27:16.887
How does the Night's Watch vow go again?

27:17.400 --> 27:19.926
I'll bet you've got it memorized
since you got here.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.648
Night gathers and now my watch begins.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.644
No, not that bit. The bit at the end.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.801
I am the sword in the darkness,

27:30.880 --> 27:32.644
the watcher on the walls,

27:32.720 --> 27:34.563
the shield that guards the realms of men.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.649
- I pledge my life...
- Right, that's enough.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.121
The shield that guards the realms of men.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.241
That's what you swore to be.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.325
Now, I'm not a learned man,

27:43.400 --> 27:44.686
but the best way to help the most people

27:44.760 --> 27:47.923
might not be sitting in a frozen castle
at the edge of the world.

27:48.240 --> 27:51.926
It just might mean wading in the muck,
getting your boots dirty,

27:52.000 --> 27:53.968
and doing what needs to be done.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.371
And what needs to be done?

27:55.440 --> 27:59.286
As long as the Boltons rule the North,
the North will suffer.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.290
Just one man's opinion.

28:31.960 --> 28:32.961
What do you want?

28:34.160 --> 28:35.924
Who are you?

28:36.240 --> 28:37.241
What?

28:37.560 --> 28:40.723
You, who walk in here
with a coin you never earned,

28:40.800 --> 28:42.802
whose value you do not respect.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.361
Who are you?

28:52.000 --> 28:53.001
No one.

28:53.720 --> 28:54.721
Ow!

28:54.800 --> 28:55.847
- Cunt!
- A lie.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.163
A sad little lie. Who are you?

28:58.240 --> 28:59.321
I told you, I'm...

29:00.080 --> 29:01.286
Do that again, and...

29:02.480 --> 29:03.925
Who are you?

29:04.320 --> 29:06.084
You're about to find out.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.209
What are you doing?

29:09.280 --> 29:11.965
We were only playing. The Game of Faces.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.162
- A girl is not ready.
- Clearly not.

29:14.640 --> 29:15.641
I am ready.

29:17.680 --> 29:18.727
For what?

29:19.120 --> 29:20.406
For whatever you want.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.171
To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.249
Whose sword is that?

29:30.320 --> 29:31.765
It belongs to Arya Stark.

29:31.840 --> 29:35.970
Arya Stark's sword, clothes, stolen silver.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.247
A man wonders,

29:38.320 --> 29:43.531
how is it that no one came to be
surrounded by Arya Stark's things?

33:48.120 --> 33:50.726
What do we do with them after we wash them?

34:21.719 --> 34:22.846
Open gate!

34:26.800 --> 34:29.167
Honor guard, stand to!

34:36.760 --> 34:39.001
Hold up. Easy.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.651
Lady Sansa. Welcome.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.771
Lord Bolton.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.121
May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton?

35:14.920 --> 35:18.367
It's an honor to meet you, my lady.

35:33.520 --> 35:37.491
I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.
You must want to wash.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.925
Thank you.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.520
Welcome home, Lady Stark.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.248
The North remembers.

36:01.920 --> 36:02.967
Sam?

36:05.040 --> 36:06.405
Maester Aemon?

36:06.480 --> 36:08.608
He apologizes for not being here.

36:09.280 --> 36:10.930
He's not feeling well.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.206
Take good care of him.

36:14.400 --> 36:15.765
Brothers.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.030
As you all know too well,

36:18.130 --> 36:20.725
it's long past time to
dig a new latrine pit.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.923
First Builder Yarwyck and I
have decided to appoint a latrine captain

36:28.000 --> 36:29.843
to oversee this crucial task.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.085
Brian.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.607
Seems like a good job for a ginger.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.128
- That's him!
- That's him.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.761
Ser Alliser.

36:54.360 --> 36:57.648
You have more experience
than any other ranger at Castle Black.

36:57.720 --> 37:00.087
You proved your valor many times over

37:00.160 --> 37:02.288
while defending the Wall
from the wildling attack.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.443
I name you First Ranger.

37:08.440 --> 37:09.646
Hear, hear!

37:14.400 --> 37:17.768
Lord Janos.
I'm giving you command of Greyguard.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.680
Greyguard is a ruin.

37:20.800 --> 37:24.805
Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.
Restore it as best you can.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.689
First Builder Yarwyck can spare 10 of his...

37:26.760 --> 37:28.364
I was charged
with the defense of King's Landing

37:28.440 --> 37:30.408
when you were soiling
your swaddling clothes.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.686
Keep your ruin.

37:35.360 --> 37:38.921
All right! That's enough of that.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.684
You mistake me, my lord.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.562
That was a command, not an offer.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.848
Pack your arms and armor,
say your farewells,

37:49.320 --> 37:51.402
and ride for Greyguard.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.570
I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.

37:56.720 --> 37:59.690
Give it to one of the fools
who cast a stone for you.

37:59.760 --> 38:04.129
I will not have it. Did you hear me, boy?
I will not have it!

38:04.200 --> 38:06.726
Are you refusing to obey my order?

38:12.640 --> 38:15.723
You can stick your order
up your bastard ass.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.406
Take Lord Janos outside.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.480
Olly, bring me my sword.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.081
- Get out.
- You cannot do this!

38:52.640 --> 38:56.645
Get your hands off me! Scum, all of you!

39:00.680 --> 39:03.604
If the boy thinks he can frighten me,
he's mistaken.

39:03.680 --> 39:04.920
Yes, very mistaken.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.684
Disgrace!

39:09.760 --> 39:12.161
I have friends.
Important friends in the capital.

39:12.280 --> 39:13.691
- You'll see.
- Kneel!

39:49.480 --> 39:53.883
If you have any last words, my lord,
now's the time.

39:57.040 --> 40:01.409
I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander.
We all serve you. I'm sorry.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.689
Not only for this,
for all I've done and said.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.725
I was wrong.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.082
My lord, please! Mercy! Mercy!

40:12.200 --> 40:13.804
I'll go! I will!

40:14.320 --> 40:15.481
Please.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.446
I'm afraid.

40:19.240 --> 40:21.607
I've always been afraid.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.449
You have served us well, my son.

41:08.760 --> 41:09.886
Thank you, Father.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.006
Which of the Seven will you worship today?

41:13.080 --> 41:14.127
The Maiden.

41:14.880 --> 41:15.881
Always the Maiden.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.170
<i>And the Stranger.</i>

41:19.600 --> 41:22.444
- Two is extra, you realize?
- Yes, yes.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.167
What are you doing?

41:35.280 --> 41:37.886
This establishment belongs
to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't...

41:39.080 --> 41:41.003
You have profaned our faith,

41:41.280 --> 41:44.124
the faith of our fathers and forefathers.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.282
I am the High Septon of the...

41:46.360 --> 41:48.522
You are a sinner.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.443
And you shall be punished.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.041
Ah!

42:05.160 --> 42:07.288
- Sinner.
- Sinner.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.044
- Sinner. Sinner.
- Repent!

42:09.120 --> 42:10.326
Sinner.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.370
Sinner.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.807
Sinner. Sinner.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.087
- Shame on you.
- Sinner.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.644
Your Grace, Grand Maester, Lord Tyrell...

42:32.320 --> 42:33.321
Uh...

42:33.600 --> 42:35.045
It doesn't matter.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.247
As the High Septon of the Faith
of the Seven,

42:38.320 --> 42:43.247
I give voice to the will of the gods
and am their foremost servant in this world.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.290
An insult to me is an insult to the gods.

42:46.400 --> 42:50.530
An assault on my person
is an assault on our very religion.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.170
- You were assaulted?
- I was.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.687
By those fanatics
who call themselves Sparrows.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.924
They humiliated me, they beat me,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.004
they left me naked and bleeding
on the cobblestones.

43:00.080 --> 43:01.650
I am lucky to be alive.

43:01.720 --> 43:04.690
I heard this assault
began in Littlefinger's brothel.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.651
This is a rather shocking thing to hear.

43:08.720 --> 43:11.451
I tend to both the highest born
and the lowliest amongst us.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.761
Even prostitutes
may earn the mercy of the Mother.

43:13.840 --> 43:17.606
So, you were ministering
to the needs of these devout prostitutes?

43:17.680 --> 43:20.729
A man's private affairs
ought to stay private.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.209
What do you want from us, High Septon?

43:24.280 --> 43:25.805
Justice.

43:25.880 --> 43:27.120
I ask that you protect our faith

43:27.200 --> 43:31.046
by arresting these criminals
and throwing them in the Black Cells.

43:31.120 --> 43:34.920
I ask that you execute their leader,
this so-called High Sparrow.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.288
He's a threat to everything we hold sacred.
If he goes unpunished...

43:38.360 --> 43:39.964
And where do I find this man?

43:40.880 --> 43:42.803
This High Sparrow?

43:52.040 --> 43:53.963
I don't think this is a good idea.

43:54.040 --> 43:57.169
Nonsense, Ser Meryn.
These are deeply religious people.

43:57.280 --> 43:59.567
Where can I find the High Sparrow?

44:01.600 --> 44:03.443
Seven blessings.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.407
- Thank you.
- Just a little more.

44:19.760 --> 44:21.091
Thank you.

44:23.800 --> 44:24.881
Thank you.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.401
A young man said I'd find
the High Sparrow back here.

44:28.480 --> 44:31.484
- Where is he?
- High Sparrow?

44:31.560 --> 44:32.971
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

44:33.280 --> 44:36.762
Like Lord Duckling or King Turtle.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.604
Still, it's meant to.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.684
We're often stuck with the names
our enemies give to us.

44:41.840 --> 44:45.208
The notion that we're all equal
in the eyes of the Seven

44:45.280 --> 44:48.602
doesn't sit well with some,
so they belittle me.

44:48.680 --> 44:49.886
Seven blessings to you.

44:49.960 --> 44:52.122
Seven blessings to you, my dear.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.527
It's only a name.
Quite an easy burden to bear.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.523
Far easier than hers.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.641
Why no shoes?

45:02.760 --> 45:06.128
Because I gave them away
to someone who needed them more.

45:07.120 --> 45:08.201
We all do that.

45:08.600 --> 45:11.922
It stops us from forgetting
what we really are.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.731
Is that why you came to King's Landing?

45:14.800 --> 45:16.245
To remind everyone?

45:16.320 --> 45:19.608
Everyone? Hard enough job
reminding myself.

45:19.680 --> 45:21.459
Well, I tell them no one's special,

45:21.559 --> 45:24.049
and they think I'm special
for telling them so.

45:25.800 --> 45:26.801
Perhaps they're right.

45:28.320 --> 45:31.164
It would be comforting to believe that,
wouldn't it?

45:32.160 --> 45:34.686
Have the gods sent you here to tempt me?

45:36.160 --> 45:37.525
I hope not.

45:38.640 --> 45:42.611
I had assumed
you'd only come here to arrest me

45:42.680 --> 45:44.523
for that incident with the High Septon.

45:45.360 --> 45:47.886
An unacceptable way
to treat the chosen representative

45:47.960 --> 45:50.611
of the gods in this world, wouldn't you say?

45:50.680 --> 45:53.047
Hypocrisy is a boil.

45:53.120 --> 45:56.647
Lancing a boil is never pleasant.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.121
Although they could have been
more careful with the blade.

46:00.640 --> 46:03.610
The High Septon came to speak to me today.

46:05.160 --> 46:07.606
He doesn't want me to arrest you.
He wants me to execute you.

46:10.520 --> 46:13.729
I wouldn't presume
to know your thoughts on the matter.

46:17.640 --> 46:19.722
My thoughts on the matter
are in line with your own.

46:20.400 --> 46:24.246
The High Septon's behavior was corrosive,
as was his attitude.

46:24.360 --> 46:28.365
Having a man like that reside in the sept
eats away at the faith from the inside.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.803
So now he resides
in the Red Keep dungeons instead.

46:34.560 --> 46:37.962
The faith and the crown are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

46:38.040 --> 46:40.122
One collapses, so does the other.

46:41.720 --> 46:45.770
We must do everything necessary
to protect one another.

47:04.600 --> 47:05.647
Your Grace.

47:05.760 --> 47:08.366
Send a raven with this message
to Littlefinger at the Eyrie,

47:08.440 --> 47:10.647
or wherever he's slithering about.

47:13.680 --> 47:15.205
At once, Your Grace.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.686
How's your work coming along?

47:17.760 --> 47:19.205
Very well.

47:19.280 --> 47:20.884
You've made progress?

47:20.960 --> 47:22.530
More than I expected.

47:22.720 --> 47:25.246
- Still a way to go, but...
- Very good.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.930
I'll leave you to it, then.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.289
Make sure Littlefinger is clear
on the meaning of the word "immediately."

47:47.600 --> 47:48.931
Shh.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.643
Easy, friend.

48:16.120 --> 48:17.963
She really is lovely.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.809
I hope I can make her happy.

48:20.880 --> 48:22.928
I hope so, too.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.925
I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa
during our travels together.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.241
She's suffered enough.

48:29.320 --> 48:32.847
I'll never hurt her. You have my word.

48:35.160 --> 48:37.049
I've heard very little about you,

48:37.920 --> 48:41.049
which makes you quite a rare thing
as lords go.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.765
I haven't been a lord very long.

48:44.840 --> 48:46.365
I was a bastard.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.044
And you're not anymore.

48:49.440 --> 48:51.727
Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.

48:51.800 --> 48:53.040
Yes, Father.

48:53.200 --> 48:54.804
And thank you, Lord Baelish.

48:55.480 --> 48:57.244
I'm forever in your debt.

49:03.280 --> 49:05.123
He seems pleased.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.201
Shouldn't he be?

49:07.880 --> 49:09.530
I assure you, she's still a virgin.

49:10.200 --> 49:11.623
Tyrion never consummated the marriage.

49:11.723 --> 49:13.727
By the law of the land,
she is no man's wife.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.040
Inspect her, if you must.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.841
I'll leave that to the brothel keeper.
It's her name I need, not her virtue.

49:21.160 --> 49:23.242
Then I have delivered everything I promised.

49:24.720 --> 49:27.007
And you're prepared for the consequences

49:27.080 --> 49:29.651
when the Lannisters hear
I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay?

49:29.720 --> 49:32.371
The Lannister name
doesn't mean what it once did.

49:32.440 --> 49:33.930
Tywin is dead.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.890
He kept his house in power
through sheer will.

49:36.960 --> 49:40.282
Without him,
Jaime has one hand and no allies.

49:40.840 --> 49:45.129
Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.565
The queen will be enraged.

49:46.680 --> 49:48.603
Queen Margaery adores Sansa.

49:49.920 --> 49:51.729
Cersei is Queen Mother,

49:51.840 --> 49:54.491
a title whose importance
wanes with each passing day.

49:54.560 --> 49:56.324
And yet she still has friends,

49:56.400 --> 49:59.961
men in important places
whom she can ask for favors.

50:00.040 --> 50:03.044
A message for you from Cersei Lannister.

50:03.720 --> 50:07.167
A rider arrived from the Eyrie
shortly before dawn.

50:07.240 --> 50:08.924
Apparently she thinks
you're still in the Vale.

50:09.760 --> 50:11.842
A message for me, you say?

50:12.480 --> 50:13.766
Strange that the seal is broken.

50:14.240 --> 50:16.607
I'm sure you understand my position,
Lord Baelish.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.722
If you receive word in the night
from the Queen Mother,

50:19.680 --> 50:22.286
it does make me question our new alliance.

50:23.200 --> 50:25.771
The Lannisters made you
one of the great lords of Westeros,

50:26.520 --> 50:29.091
yet here you are in the North
undermining them.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.170
Why gamble with your position?

50:32.960 --> 50:35.008
Every ambitious move is a gamble.

50:35.880 --> 50:38.611
You gambled when you drove a dagger
into Robb Stark's heart.

50:41.280 --> 50:43.089
It appears that your gamble paid off.

50:43.360 --> 50:44.885
You're Warden of the North.

50:44.960 --> 50:46.962
I had Tywin Lannister's backing.

50:47.040 --> 50:49.168
Who supports me now? You?

50:49.920 --> 50:51.763
The Eyrie is mine.

50:52.240 --> 50:56.723
The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed
an alliance with the lords of the North,

50:56.800 --> 51:00.009
they brought down the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

51:03.320 --> 51:05.322
I'd like to borrow one of your birds.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.609
Cersei will expect a reply.

51:08.320 --> 51:10.049
I'd like to read the reply.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.729
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.165
Volantis is a large city.

51:36.680 --> 51:38.444
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

51:38.520 --> 51:42.525
The likelihood of you being spotted here
increases a hundredfold.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.011
Mmm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

51:44.440 --> 51:46.807
I'm not sure how many new ways
I can find of saying this.

51:50.760 --> 51:56.324
I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen
if I lose my mind.

51:56.400 --> 51:59.722
I can't remember the last face I saw
that wasn't yours.

51:59.880 --> 52:01.484
It's a perfectly good face.

52:01.880 --> 52:03.245
I am losing my mind.

52:03.320 --> 52:05.607
If anyone recognizes you,
you'll lose more than that.

52:05.680 --> 52:09.002
Look, we are thousands of miles
from Westeros.

52:11.520 --> 52:12.521
What am I?

52:13.720 --> 52:15.688
One more drunk dwarf.

52:17.160 --> 52:18.844
Whoa!

52:45.520 --> 52:46.601
We have to go now.

52:46.680 --> 52:48.842
Come on, hold it. Hold it.

52:48.920 --> 52:50.046
Are you ready?

52:52.480 --> 52:53.606
Slaves.

52:53.680 --> 52:57.605
Yes, the Volantene masters
are very organized.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.090
Flies for dung shovelers.

53:01.560 --> 53:02.925
Hammers for builders.

53:03.920 --> 53:06.048
Tears for whores.

53:06.160 --> 53:07.924
Lest they forget.

53:12.960 --> 53:17.682
Lord cast your light upon us.

53:19.320 --> 53:21.800
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

53:21.920 --> 53:24.082
We should keep moving.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.283
I was once as you are now.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.928
Bought and sold,

53:36.480 --> 53:38.369
scourged and branded,

53:38.920 --> 53:42.811
The only red priest we had in King's Landing
was Thoros of Myr.

53:42.880 --> 53:43.881
This one's much better-looking.

53:43.960 --> 53:46.008
The Lord of Light hears your voice.

53:46.960 --> 53:49.884
He hears the king as he hears the slave;

53:50.120 --> 53:52.282
he hears the Stone Men in their misery.

53:52.440 --> 53:54.204
Stone men.

53:54.280 --> 53:57.727
Good luck stopping
the spread of greyscale with prayer.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.928
You'd have better luck
dancing away the plague.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.570
He has sent you a savior!

54:01.960 --> 54:06.170
From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world!

54:06.720 --> 54:09.929
The Dragon Queen!

54:10.000 --> 54:13.641
We're going to meet the savior.
You should have told me.

54:13.720 --> 54:16.166
Who doesn't want to meet the savior?

54:31.400 --> 54:32.401
Come on.

54:34.120 --> 54:35.849
Let's find a brothel.

54:42.240 --> 54:44.686
Build your house in a day.

54:56.240 --> 54:59.403
It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.

54:59.680 --> 55:02.889
It's even better luck
to suck a dwarf's cock.

55:06.840 --> 55:09.844
See? We blend right in.

55:09.920 --> 55:13.242
Just two more travelers mad with lust.

55:18.240 --> 55:19.685
Thank you.

55:28.400 --> 55:30.368
What curious hair.

55:32.360 --> 55:33.407
The Mother of Dragons!

55:36.840 --> 55:40.208
It appears you're not
the only Targaryen supporter.

55:41.080 --> 55:43.003
We were just heading east to see you.

55:43.080 --> 55:44.809
I've got a dragon for you.

55:44.880 --> 55:47.087
How much to make him spit fire?

55:50.600 --> 55:55.003
Someone who inspires priests and whores
is worth taking seriously.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.565
What makes you worth that much?

55:56.640 --> 55:59.120
- I'm magic.
- I'll bet you bloody are.

56:02.160 --> 56:04.606
Well, she's taken.

56:06.360 --> 56:07.407
Where are you going?

56:07.760 --> 56:09.922
I need to speak to someone with hair.

56:12.360 --> 56:13.771
- Hello.
- Hello.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.201
You've got no drink.

56:15.280 --> 56:17.044
You've got no money.

56:17.120 --> 56:19.202
Do I look like a man without money?

56:20.800 --> 56:22.643
Never trust looks.

56:22.720 --> 56:25.530
Until quite recently,
I was one of the richest men in the world.

56:27.800 --> 56:30.804
But who needs wealth
when you can make a woman laugh?

56:33.080 --> 56:34.969
I always pay my debts.

56:35.400 --> 56:36.811
I'm well known for it.

56:41.720 --> 56:43.165
You like her.

56:44.240 --> 56:46.083
They all like her.

56:46.160 --> 56:47.321
They all want to fuck a queen.

56:47.880 --> 56:49.211
That's because they've never met a queen.

56:49.280 --> 56:50.566
You're just saying that.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.324
You know how to spot a liar.

56:53.280 --> 56:55.726
If I could pick any girl here,

56:55.800 --> 56:57.245
I would pick you.

56:58.320 --> 56:59.685
Why?

57:00.240 --> 57:02.607
Because you have a skeptical mind.

57:07.040 --> 57:10.601
All right, then. I'm warning you,
we're going to have to wash you first.

57:11.360 --> 57:12.361
Come on.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.329
I'm sorry, I can't.

57:24.680 --> 57:27.160
Of course you can. You're shy.

57:28.280 --> 57:29.725
I'm not.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.446
Have another drink.

57:32.520 --> 57:35.330
Gladly, but this, I can't do.

57:35.400 --> 57:38.324
Believe me,
no one is more shocked than I am.

57:38.400 --> 57:40.368
I hope it passes.

57:41.160 --> 57:43.561
What will I do in my spare time?

57:46.520 --> 57:49.251
Go for a piss. That's a start.

58:07.800 --> 58:10.087
No need to worry. I was just...

58:10.240 --> 58:11.241
Ch.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.610
I thought you were someone else.

58:14.800 --> 58:16.006
Shaw's almost over.

58:16.760 --> 58:20.321
I'm sure there are girls inside
who'd be happy to oblige.

58:21.240 --> 58:22.366
You've made some kind of mistake.

58:22.440 --> 58:25.250
Why don't you tell me
what you think you're doing, and then...

58:27.040 --> 58:29.088
I'm taking you to the queen.
