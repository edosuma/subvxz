00:38.625 --> 00:39.955
<i>Nature,</i>

00:41.250 --> 00:42.630
<i>the universe,</i>

00:42.750 --> 00:44.920
<i>our own existence,</i>

00:45.625 --> 00:48.165
<i>are ruled by laws
that are well known.</i>

00:48.292 --> 00:50.212
<i>Laws that nothing</i>

00:50.333 --> 00:52.423
<i>and nobody can escape.</i>

01:15.208 --> 01:19.378
<i>Nevertheless, the scientific community
had overlooked something until now:</i>

01:20.042 --> 01:23.462
<i>the strange and deep relationship
between those laws</i>

01:23.542 --> 01:25.672
<i>and our own emotional behavior.</i>

01:25.958 --> 01:29.288
<i>You are about to find out
how the laws of physics</i>

01:29.375 --> 01:32.375
<i>can be applied to the emotions
that rule our daily routine.</i>

01:34.333 --> 01:36.383
<i>And including, especially,</i>

01:36.458 --> 01:39.128
<i>those of a much lesser-known
discipline:</i>

01:39.292 --> 01:42.332
Thermodynamics!

01:42.917 --> 01:45.377
Okay, what are thermodynamics?

01:45.542 --> 01:47.792
Can any of you tell me?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.920
Don't everyone raise your hand
at once,

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
you'll confuse me.

01:51.125 --> 01:54.125
As the name indicates, thermodynamics

01:54.292 --> 01:56.212
is the study of the movement of heat.

01:56.292 --> 02:00.382
Specifically, the ways in which
energy is transformed.

02:00.542 --> 02:04.502
Because as you already know,
energy can take many forms.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.418
This is Manel Suarez,

02:06.500 --> 02:09.580
he'll be my assistant during the course.

02:09.833 --> 02:12.173
Please go easy on him.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.633
Manel spent his weekend building

02:14.708 --> 02:16.578
this little steamboat for you,

02:16.792 --> 02:21.042
which works thanks to the laws
of thermodynamics.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.830
Please, everyone come closer.

02:26.708 --> 02:27.828
Quickly.

02:27.917 --> 02:29.497
Take these seats.

02:30.333 --> 02:33.923
Manel, explain how it works
before the demonstration.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.830
Okay, um...

02:35.917 --> 02:38.627
This little bowl contains
the fuel that will feed the flame,

02:38.750 --> 02:42.420
the flame will heat
the water in this tank...

02:42.542 --> 02:45.962
Once heated, the water will expand

02:46.042 --> 02:48.962
and come out of these
two small tubes, propelling the boat.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.920
That's so, Manel.

02:51.042 --> 02:52.252
Beautiful.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.500
Let's try it out.

02:59.208 --> 03:00.788
Here, take mine.

03:10.917 --> 03:12.747
Looks like it won't light...

03:18.875 --> 03:19.955
That's all right.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.325
What you're seeing

03:21.417 --> 03:24.707
also responds to the principles
of thermodynamics.

03:25.625 --> 03:29.575
<i>The principles we're talking about
not only rule our lives</i>

03:30.083 --> 03:32.793
<i>completely,
they will also finally determine</i>

03:32.958 --> 03:35.128
<i>our fate and that of
the entire universe.</i>

03:36.250 --> 03:39.380
<i>Prepare yourselves,
on the shoulders of giants,</i>

03:39.542 --> 03:41.962
<i>for a new leap in the history of science.</i>

03:42.125 --> 03:45.165
<i>Welcome to the passionate
and terrifying world of...</i>

03:45.750 --> 03:51.540
THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS
A DOCUMENTARY BY MANEL SUAREZ

04:39.375 --> 04:40.995
<i>In order to discuss thermodynamics,</i>

04:41.167 --> 04:43.287
<i>we need to refer to a system.</i>

04:43.458 --> 04:45.878
<i>In this case, let's take
the "humanity" system,</i>

04:46.000 --> 04:48.080
<i>with its thousands of individual
particles</i>

04:48.250 --> 04:50.460
<i>moving and interacting
with each other.</i>

04:50.792 --> 04:53.212
<i>And we'll focus on a few
of those particles.</i>

04:53.375 --> 04:55.245
<i>For example, the Manel-particle...</i>

04:56.333 --> 04:57.963
<i>and the Elena-particle,</i>

04:58.208 --> 04:59.918
<i>who still haven't met.</i>

05:02.750 --> 05:04.540
<i>The first thing we must know</i>

05:04.750 --> 05:07.750
<i>is that all thermodynamic systems
tend towards equilibrium.</i>

05:08.958 --> 05:11.918
<i>But don't be fooled
by how nice this word sounds.</i>

05:12.083 --> 05:13.633
<i>It's precisely the lack</i>

05:13.708 --> 05:16.958
<i>of equilibrium that could give
the Manel and Elena particles</i>

05:17.042 --> 05:19.792
<i>the chance to meet and interact,</i>

05:19.875 --> 05:21.785
<i>to build something together.</i>

05:25.417 --> 05:28.827
<i>Equilibrium in this case means
the dispersion of the particles</i>

05:28.917 --> 05:31.827
<i>and the absence of activity,
of heat exchange.</i>

05:33.042 --> 05:36.962
<i>Unfortunately, that's what
we tend to move towards.</i>

05:44.083 --> 05:47.883
You're sleeping over at my place tomorrow.
I have to get up early.

05:48.208 --> 05:49.288
Me too.

05:50.208 --> 05:52.128
How was your first day of class?

05:52.292 --> 05:53.632
Did the boat work?

05:53.833 --> 05:56.133
Wonderfully, like an outboard.

05:56.708 --> 06:02.328
My super physicist aeronautical
naval industrial nuclear engineer.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.420
I bet all the girls
were making eyes at you.

06:04.583 --> 06:05.633
One of them did.

06:05.708 --> 06:08.708
I love how you lie to me
to make me horny.

06:08.958 --> 06:10.788
Have you done everything yet?

06:10.958 --> 06:14.578
Wash the dishes, sweep the floor,
air out the flat,

06:14.875 --> 06:17.125
lock the front door twice?

06:17.542 --> 06:20.962
Then the Raquel-Manuel
physical system is ready to fuck.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.955
You still need to get your
things ready for tomorrow.

06:25.125 --> 06:27.125
And super romantic.

06:27.917 --> 06:29.247
You've got it all.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.205
<i>But let's go straight to heat exchange</i>

06:33.375 --> 06:35.535
<i>and the laws of thermodynamics.</i>

06:42.958 --> 06:43.958
What?

06:44.208 --> 06:45.418
It simply what?

06:45.500 --> 06:47.960
It's transformed, it's turned
into something else.

06:48.083 --> 06:48.753
ONE MONTH LATER

06:48.833 --> 06:49.463
Into what?

06:49.542 --> 06:52.132
- I don't know, into affection.
- Affection?

06:52.458 --> 06:54.288
That's what I feel for my dog.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.995
Not that kind, it's more special.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.923
But last night we fucked
and you said you loved me.

07:01.042 --> 07:03.132
I was your proton
and you were my electron.

07:03.375 --> 07:06.075
- You called me pickles.
- Well, I mainly called you Raquel.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.710
What are you talking about?
What happened?

07:08.875 --> 07:11.415
Love doesn't just transform overnight!

07:13.042 --> 07:14.672
<i>Well, it wasn't overnight.</i>

07:14.750 --> 07:17.420
Oh, it wasn't overnight.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.170
No, it wasn't.

07:18.250 --> 07:19.380
ONE YEAR LATER

07:19.458 --> 07:21.328
We decided to take a break
3 months ago.

07:21.417 --> 07:23.657
Two months, 18 days and 6 hours
since you asked for time.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.923
Exactly, it wasn't overnight. - You're not telling me the truth.
- What?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.518
I'm saying I don't love you anymore.

07:31.542 --> 07:33.252
<i>No, you're not telling me
the whole truth.</i>

07:33.333 --> 07:36.693
What else do you want me to say? - Why did your love transform?
<i>- I already told you.</i>

07:37.750 --> 07:41.040
Love doesn't just transform overnight!

07:42.000 --> 07:43.960
- You're going into a loop.
<i>- No, I'm not.</i>

07:44.083 --> 07:45.543
- Say it.
- Say what?

07:45.667 --> 07:48.747
What your love has really
turned into.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.593
- You really want to know?
- You owe me that.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.997
Into indifference.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.083
You think I'm stupid?

07:54.125 --> 07:57.285
Indifference is what's left when love
has turned into something else.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.000
I don't understand you.

07:59.167 --> 08:01.127
You understand me perfectly.
Say it.

08:01.292 --> 08:02.332
Please, say it.

08:02.417 --> 08:03.207
Please.

08:03.333 --> 08:03.963
Say it!

08:04.042 --> 08:05.042
There's someone else.

08:05.417 --> 08:06.787
There's someone else.

08:06.875 --> 08:10.035
ONE MONTH LATER - ONE YEAR LATER

08:34.332 --> 08:37.753
<i>Which brings us to the second law
of thermodynamics.</i>

08:38.042 --> 08:39.381
- Wait a second!
- Wait a second!

08:40.082 --> 08:41.523
<i>But let's not get ahead
of ourselves.</i>

08:42.792 --> 08:44.962
<i>To fully understand what's happening,</i>

08:45.125 --> 08:46.745
<i>we have to go back in time</i>

08:46.917 --> 08:49.497
<i>to the moment where it all began.</i>

09:17.500 --> 09:22.040
<i>Inertia. That's what's acting
on the Manel-body at this moment.</i>

09:22.208 --> 09:24.708
<i>And in general,
up until this moment.</i>

09:24.875 --> 09:26.995
- Do you love me?
- Madly.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.415
<i>But let's continue
with the laws of motion.</i>

09:29.583 --> 09:32.423
<i>The girl you see now, or Eva-body,
will help us explain the second law.</i>

09:39.167 --> 09:44.167
<i>In this case, the force propelling Eva
is named Rosa, who is also her mother.</i>

09:44.250 --> 09:46.580
<i>She's been waiting for her
for 15 minutes to have lunch.</i>

09:48.000 --> 09:50.960
<i>And here we can see
the effects of the third law.</i>

10:04.750 --> 10:05.750
<i>Action,</i>

10:06.375 --> 10:07.415
<i>reaction.</i>

10:08.875 --> 10:11.375
<i>But Newton's huge contribution
doesn't end here,</i>

10:12.292 --> 10:15.172
<i>nor the event that triggered our story.</i>

10:17.208 --> 10:19.628
<i>Allow me to introduce
the Pablo-body</i>

10:20.083 --> 10:23.583
<i>and one of the key laws of physics
and of this story:</i>

10:24.250 --> 10:26.000
<i>The law of gravity</i>

10:26.417 --> 10:28.287
<i>or attraction of bodies.</i>

10:44.542 --> 10:48.292
<i>This law is so important that
we should stop here for a second.</i>

11:09.750 --> 11:12.380
<i>A body's gravity
depends on its mass,</i>

11:12.875 --> 11:14.875
<i>which we mustn't identify
by its weight,</i>

11:15.000 --> 11:17.420
<i>rather by the amount
of attractive material.</i>

11:17.542 --> 11:21.582
<i>That's why the Pablo-body and the
fatso-body are the ones attracted,</i>

11:22.208 --> 11:25.078
<i>the ones that fall towards
the super-massive Elena-body,</i>

11:25.250 --> 11:27.080
<i>and not the other way around.</i>

11:53.958 --> 11:54.958
<i>Gravity.</i>

11:55.250 --> 11:57.830
<i>It alone can set us in motion,</i>

11:57.958 --> 11:59.998
<i>change the direction
of our path,</i>

12:02.708 --> 12:04.708
<i>or disintegrate us.</i>

12:12.917 --> 12:14.077
God, what happened?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.537
I'm sorry, are you hurt?

12:15.750 --> 12:17.540
- What a blow. You okay?
- Yeah.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.710
Jesus Christ, I cracked your head open.
Why are you on the ground?

12:21.042 --> 12:22.132
It had to be you.

12:22.292 --> 12:23.922
You two know each other?

12:24.042 --> 12:25.122
Did you do this on purpose?

12:25.250 --> 12:27.080
I wouldn't be surprised
if you planned it.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.330
You're the one with
the twisted mind here.

12:29.417 --> 12:32.537
And no, it wasn't on purpose.
I wasn't that bent on meeting you.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.998
And yes, I'm okay. Are you?

12:35.083 --> 12:37.253
Seeing stars, but okay, yeah.

12:37.417 --> 12:39.257
I'm so sorry, I don't know
what I was thinking.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.212
We're okay, thank you!

12:41.708 --> 12:42.878
Thank you.

12:43.750 --> 12:44.960
Thanks.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.665
We were meeting for a drink
on the terrace.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.960
Would you two like to join us
while we recover?

12:50.167 --> 12:52.077
Sure, no problem.

12:52.250 --> 12:54.500
Okay, until my friend gets here.

12:54.625 --> 12:56.205
That's Manel, I'm Pablo.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.075
I'm Eva.
Nice crashing into you.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.920
Likewise.

13:00.708 --> 13:01.918
I'm Manel.

13:03.125 --> 13:04.125
No, thank you.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.827
Elena, right?

13:06.625 --> 13:08.995
You look great in all the photos.
Spectacular.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.167
But the campaign's a bit dull.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.543
You know we publicists
criticize everything.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.420
Really? I never noticed.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.708
What do you two do?

13:18.875 --> 13:21.325
I'm a criminal lawyer.
I recently opened

13:21.417 --> 13:23.747
- my own office.
- How brave.

13:24.167 --> 13:25.287
You have no idea.

13:25.958 --> 13:26.958
And you?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.710
I'm an astrophysicist.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.745
I'm writing a thesis about
thermodynamics in complex systems.

13:31.833 --> 13:32.673
Yeah?

13:32.750 --> 13:36.130
- How interesting.
- He's a genius at what he does.

13:36.708 --> 13:39.538
<i>Here is where it all began.
Luckily gravity</i>

13:39.667 --> 13:41.957
<i>isn't the only force of nature.</i>

13:42.083 --> 13:45.173
And how do thermodynamics work

13:45.250 --> 13:48.250
- in complex systems?
- It's very easy...

13:49.500 --> 13:52.830
<i>It's too bad there are so many
super-massive bodies in the universe.</i>

13:52.958 --> 13:54.078
Oh, hi.

13:54.875 --> 13:55.535
How are you?

13:55.625 --> 13:58.075
Look, Pablo, Eva and...

13:58.708 --> 13:59.708
Manel.

14:00.417 --> 14:02.327
You ready?
The others all came too.

14:02.458 --> 14:03.748
Okay, I'll be right there.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.830
- Don't worry about it, I've got it.
- Thanks.

14:09.917 --> 14:13.037
Well, it was nice crashing
into you guys.

14:13.208 --> 14:14.208
- Likewise.
- A pleasure.

14:14.292 --> 14:15.962
Shell-shocked.

14:16.292 --> 14:17.292
Bye.

14:18.208 --> 14:19.628
Elena!

14:20.042 --> 14:21.332
Take my card.

14:21.583 --> 14:24.133
Give me a call when the swelling
goes down and we'll celebrate.

14:24.625 --> 14:27.455
Right? All four of us.
We're having fun.

14:27.542 --> 14:30.422
Sure, whoever recovers first
can call.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.375
Okay, it's a deal.

14:32.792 --> 14:33.832
Bye.

14:39.375 --> 14:40.825
She's gorgeous, huh?

14:40.958 --> 14:42.248
Yeah, she's okay.

14:42.333 --> 14:45.133
You're not so bad yourself.
Besides brave.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.130
I'm going out for a drink
tonight with Pablo.

14:51.292 --> 14:53.502
And some people from his agency,
I think.

14:54.708 --> 14:57.748
Maybe Pablito will find himself
a girlfriend...

15:45.417 --> 15:49.287
Do you realize you've created
a mini solar system on the dance floor?

15:51.542 --> 15:54.292
You have a ton of planets of all types.

15:54.458 --> 15:56.078
Look, giant planets... Desert planets...

16:02.542 --> 16:04.422
Gaseous planets...

16:07.250 --> 16:08.960
Red planets...

16:09.583 --> 16:11.633
Even inhabited ones.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.423
I was inhabited when I was 16 too.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.082
For real.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.292
Are you a planet too?

16:18.458 --> 16:20.578
I'm Mercury. I'm burning up

16:20.667 --> 16:22.037
as we speak.

16:26.958 --> 16:28.828
Look, you even have a planet

16:28.917 --> 16:30.377
with its own moon.

17:04.583 --> 17:07.963
Look at that, I think your admirers
are even following the same laws

17:08.125 --> 17:09.625
as the planets around the sun.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.292
- You're crazy.
- Seriously. Kepler's laws.

17:12.458 --> 17:15.078
If you watch closely,
they're not going around in circles.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.920
When they're behind you,
they move further away.

17:18.041 --> 17:20.212
And when they pass in front of you,
they move closer.

17:20.375 --> 17:23.954
So you'll look at them.
They're actually following an ellipse.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.542
They're filling the dance floor.

17:26.375 --> 17:29.535
But since they don't want
to look too desperate,

17:29.750 --> 17:32.750
when they pass in front of you,
they walk a little faster.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.420
Are there more laws?

17:34.583 --> 17:35.333
One more.

17:35.417 --> 17:37.167
Planets which orbit further away

17:37.292 --> 17:39.502
move more slowly. Probably because

17:39.708 --> 17:42.038
you make the closer planets
more nervous.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.958
So if you get closer
you'll get more nervous?

17:45.083 --> 17:47.963
I'll start emitting ultraviolet radiation.

17:51.875 --> 17:52.955
Here?

17:53.833 --> 17:56.423
Here we're risking a cosmic collision.

17:57.833 --> 18:00.133
You're crazy... but cute.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.655
- Wait a second!
- Wait a second!

18:48.792 --> 18:49.422
Who is it?

18:49.500 --> 18:51.460
- Who is who?
- Who do you think?

18:51.625 --> 18:52.875
What does that matter now?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.130
It's "Leoreennazo," right?

18:54.208 --> 18:55.378
How do you know?

18:55.500 --> 18:58.210
- You can't even lie.
- What a shitty liar.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.880
The bill...<i> you</i> asked me for.

19:08.917 --> 19:10.127
Manel, don't do it.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.038
Please, think about it.

19:12.208 --> 19:14.078
I know you,
she's not right for you.

19:14.208 --> 19:16.998
Do whatever the fuck you want,
I don't care.

19:17.167 --> 19:19.707
But I'm telling you,
that guy is going to fuck you up.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.542
She's a top model. Mulatto.
Everybody wants her.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.417
An actor and a model.
You know what that means?

19:26.583 --> 19:28.753
His job is to fuck anything that moves!

19:28.833 --> 19:31.923
You think she'll put up with your order
and your obsessions like I do?

19:32.250 --> 19:33.930
That she'll appreciate
your absurd theories

19:33.958 --> 19:35.309
about love and the laws of physics?

19:35.333 --> 19:37.793
You think he'll settle for one model

19:37.958 --> 19:41.208
when he can have one every day
who are also actresses?

19:41.583 --> 19:44.213
You're going to suffer
even when you're on top.

19:44.333 --> 19:48.003
I'll sit outside my door
and watch your cadaver walk by.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.667
I told you this would happen.

19:52.750 --> 19:55.710
And while you were insisting
that you needed to reflect,

19:55.792 --> 19:57.672
you were fucking that jerk?

19:59.292 --> 20:01.002
The fucking stud.

20:01.125 --> 20:04.955
Thank God I saw it coming
and had my guard up.

20:05.125 --> 20:09.705
Otherwise you'd dump me
and I would feel like shit right now.

20:11.458 --> 20:13.578
<i>But we're getting ahead
of ourselves again.</i>

20:14.708 --> 20:16.498
<i>Before we continue
with thermodynamics,</i>

20:16.708 --> 20:19.418
<i>we need to go back
in the relationship and science</i>

20:19.792 --> 20:23.882
<i>to the period of happy discoveries
and faith in knowledge,</i>

20:24.000 --> 20:26.880
<i>to the sweet peak
of classical physics.</i>

20:29.208 --> 20:31.458
You're a grandfather!

20:37.375 --> 20:39.035
This is my favorite corner.

20:54.167 --> 20:55.417
Shit!

20:55.542 --> 20:57.252
- Damn it!
- Gross!

20:59.958 --> 21:00.958
Please...

21:01.083 --> 21:02.713
Don't touch me with that!

21:15.958 --> 21:17.998
<i>Gravity is a powerful force</i>

21:18.083 --> 21:20.753
<i>when it comes to attracting bodies
to each other.</i>

21:24.000 --> 21:26.600
<i>But it stops being one once
they've already been brought together.</i>

21:41.375 --> 21:42.955
<i>So let's study these forces</i>

21:43.042 --> 21:46.502
<i>in relation to our particular
Manel-Elena atomic system.</i>

22:17.625 --> 22:20.245
Here we're risking a cosmic collision.

22:24.833 --> 22:27.043
You're crazy... but cute.

22:27.208 --> 22:28.208
<i>Chemistry.</i>

22:28.250 --> 22:32.710
<i>Chemistry is what made Elena
choose me instead of Pablo that night.</i>

22:35.083 --> 22:38.963
<i>It's also what makes everything flow
smoothly between particles.</i>

22:41.458 --> 22:42.578
Okay, Elena...

22:42.917 --> 22:46.707
It was a pleasure.
You can call Pablo, you have his number,

22:46.875 --> 22:49.745
- if you want to hook up sometime.
- You don't want to come with me?

22:50.917 --> 22:52.207
Good morning.

22:54.125 --> 22:56.575
<i>Or what causes that tingle</i>

22:56.667 --> 22:58.707
<i>whenever we're about to see
the other particle.</i>

22:58.792 --> 23:01.082
- You can't come in here.
- I'm here to see Elena.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.330
You're Manel?

23:02.625 --> 23:04.955
Go ahead, you can stay on that side.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.540
<i>When the chemistry is intense,</i>

23:24.833 --> 23:26.883
<i>you really feel the electricity.</i>

23:27.000 --> 23:28.830
I'll be done in a little while.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.752
You're very organized, aren't you?

23:41.917 --> 23:43.707
No. You think?

23:44.958 --> 23:47.628
- Where's dinner?
- In the oven.

23:48.708 --> 23:50.378
And the dirty pans?

23:50.833 --> 23:52.333
Or clean ones?

23:52.500 --> 23:54.170
It's a question of method.

23:55.750 --> 23:58.210
How about some wine, Mr. Method?

23:59.417 --> 24:03.037
What's fascinating about science
is everything can be explained.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.538
For example, don't you think it's strange

24:05.750 --> 24:07.559
that with all the advances
we've made in biology,

24:07.583 --> 24:08.923
we still don't know what life is?

24:09.042 --> 24:11.292
That the famous mystery
still hasn't been revealed?

24:11.458 --> 24:12.708
I don't know, is it?

24:13.125 --> 24:14.955
Maybe there's nothing to reveal.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.415
That's what's amazing.

24:16.583 --> 24:20.423
Life is probably just a consequence
of how atoms organize themselves,

24:20.583 --> 24:23.383
another step in the evolution
of complex systems.

24:23.542 --> 24:25.132
That's why I study them.

24:25.958 --> 24:27.958
You're the one who's a complex system.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.670
We're just a bunch of organized atoms.

24:31.083 --> 24:34.543
Even if we think there's something
divine about life and we're in charge,

24:34.958 --> 24:38.208
everything is predetermined
by a few basic rules.

24:38.375 --> 24:39.875
How sad, right?

24:40.083 --> 24:42.963
I don't know, I'd rather think
there is a mystery

24:43.083 --> 24:44.383
and that life is special.

24:44.542 --> 24:45.882
If not, what's the point?

24:50.167 --> 24:53.917
This bunch of organized atoms has decided
it needs to go to the bathroom.

24:54.042 --> 24:55.162
Actually, you didn't decide.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.380
It was already decided
before you decided.

25:14.958 --> 25:16.168
You were saying?

25:17.125 --> 25:19.625
No. No, I forgot.

25:27.875 --> 25:30.245
I'll start emitting ultraviolet radiation.

25:52.042 --> 25:56.922
<i>Actually, weak force isn't so weak
nor difficult to detect.</i>

25:58.500 --> 26:01.330
<i>You just need to be in the right place.</i>

26:02.125 --> 26:04.915
<i>Within the atomic system, that force</i>

26:05.042 --> 26:06.752
<i>is felt with great intensity.</i>

26:11.458 --> 26:13.038
Tell me you don't snore.

26:14.083 --> 26:16.383
PHASE 1

26:25.250 --> 26:26.540
Hi!

26:28.000 --> 26:29.830
This is where you're preparing
your thesis?

26:31.958 --> 26:33.998
I got you a present,
I couldn't help myself.

26:34.708 --> 26:36.578
What? Why?

26:36.792 --> 26:38.332
Because it's not your style...

26:38.500 --> 26:41.460
And it proves that Mr. Method
is not a lost cause. There's still hope.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.710
It's beautiful.

26:45.667 --> 26:48.207
It's identical, how did you do it?

26:48.375 --> 26:51.375
I had to take the sculptor
to the park and make a cast.

26:51.542 --> 26:53.002
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

26:53.167 --> 26:55.167
We almost got caught. It was fun.

26:55.333 --> 26:58.253
I think it's the best present
anyone's ever given me.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.290
Get a room!

27:09.167 --> 27:11.077
Let's go to your place
and pick a spot for it.

27:48.292 --> 27:52.132
<i>Most people would say that
strong nuclear force is love</i>

27:52.708 --> 27:55.038
<i>because it makes particles
inseparable.</i>

27:55.458 --> 27:57.578
<i>But more careful analysis
demonstrates</i>

27:57.750 --> 27:59.830
<i>that it's actually more of a dependence.</i>

27:59.958 --> 28:00.998
Have a happy day.

28:01.417 --> 28:02.577
You too.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.880
<i>The farther away
the other particle gets,</i>

28:25.000 --> 28:26.750
<i>the more you need it.</i>

28:27.917 --> 28:30.167
<i>And when the rubber band breaks,</i>

28:31.000 --> 28:33.790
<i>things like the atomic bomb happen.</i>

29:17.083 --> 29:19.793
- Wanna hear a secret?
- Please.

29:20.708 --> 29:23.078
You're the first person I'm telling.

29:25.292 --> 29:26.832
I want to be an actress.

29:26.958 --> 29:29.328
Actually, it's what I've always
wanted to be...

29:29.750 --> 29:34.080
because I love the idea
of stopping being myself

29:34.250 --> 29:36.500
and pretending I'm someone else,
living other lives,

29:36.917 --> 29:39.827
meeting different people
with stories to tell...

29:39.917 --> 29:41.497
Do you remember the guy

29:41.583 --> 29:45.133
I was talking to after the photo shoot?
With the black hat?

29:45.917 --> 29:47.637
The one who was devouring you
with his eyes?

29:47.667 --> 29:48.957
Yeah, that one.

29:49.708 --> 29:53.958
He offered me the starring role
in a short film.

29:54.458 --> 29:58.208
I haven't read the script yet,
but I just decided I'm going to do it.

30:02.125 --> 30:04.325
Thanks for telling me your secret.

30:09.958 --> 30:12.498
<i>The question you're probably
asking yourselves</i>

30:12.708 --> 30:15.288
<i>is if two particles have
the same forces acting on them,</i>

30:15.458 --> 30:17.708
<i>do they feel them
with the same intensity?</i>

30:21.833 --> 30:23.833
I like y... being with you.

30:23.917 --> 30:25.287
Look what pretty bikes!

30:27.750 --> 30:28.500
<i>There you see.</i>

30:28.625 --> 30:30.625
<i>Some signs indicate that these forces</i>

30:30.708 --> 30:34.458
<i>might not have</i> exactly <i> the same</i>
<i>effect on both particles.</i>

30:36.125 --> 30:37.125
Tell me you don't snore.

30:37.292 --> 30:41.962
<i>For the other particle, the weak nuclear</i>
<i>force might be</i> too <i> weak.</i>

30:42.125 --> 30:45.375
I'm sorry, but I have trouble sleeping
in the same bed with someone else.

30:46.250 --> 30:49.000
<i>Or the electromagnetic charge
might not be</i>

30:49.083 --> 30:50.713
<i>complementary enough.</i>

30:53.042 --> 30:56.502
<i>Or the strong force rubber band</i>
<i>might be</i> too <i> elastic.</i>

30:56.708 --> 30:57.828
I missed you so much.

30:58.167 --> 31:00.417
For me the week flew by!

31:05.458 --> 31:10.328
<i>Not to mention that gravity
never stops acting on us.</i>

31:14.708 --> 31:16.378
You already hold hands in the street?

31:16.792 --> 31:18.752
Just the other day
and she found an excuse

31:18.833 --> 31:21.213
- right away to let go.
- But you see each other a lot.

31:21.292 --> 31:23.632
No, she's always too busy.

31:24.375 --> 31:25.875
Damn, this chick is hot.

31:26.250 --> 31:29.380
Sure you don't want to see?
She's a bombshell.

31:29.958 --> 31:32.958
They offered Elena this campaign,
but she couldn't do it.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.125
Better.

31:34.292 --> 31:38.752
You have no idea.
The other day after the photos,

31:38.833 --> 31:40.003
when we finished...

31:44.083 --> 31:46.503
Manel, you might be picking up
signals that aren't there.

31:47.125 --> 31:49.245
You're grabbing at straws.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.748
You guys have fun together, right?

31:51.958 --> 31:52.708
I do.

31:52.792 --> 31:54.502
Maybe she's just a little spooked.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.128
No, you notice stuff like that.

31:56.292 --> 31:58.559
Your body can tell if the other
person is falling in love or not.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.883
Damn, those are big words.
You're falling in love?

32:02.750 --> 32:04.750
I fell in love the day
we crashed into her.

32:06.292 --> 32:07.502
What about you?

32:07.708 --> 32:08.708
What about me?

32:08.833 --> 32:10.713
- With Eva.
- Fine.

32:10.875 --> 32:12.875
We hang out, have sex, good vibe.

32:13.417 --> 32:14.877
But are you...?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.130
What?

32:16.625 --> 32:17.825
No way.

32:18.625 --> 32:22.385
I wouldn't mind because she's fantastic, but no. - What about her?
- Her? No, she isn't either.

32:28.083 --> 32:29.753
Well, I don't think so.

32:30.042 --> 32:31.962
I hope not, she hasn't said anything.

32:32.375 --> 32:33.375
Damn.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.500
No, I don't think so. No.

32:36.625 --> 32:39.705
No, definitely not. Hell no.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.535
No, no, no.

32:43.958 --> 32:46.378
- At six?
- Yeah.

32:49.542 --> 32:51.172
Hi. What's up?

32:57.542 --> 32:58.832
Oops, sorry.

33:06.625 --> 33:10.375
Take my hand or I'll make a huge
fucking scene you won't believe.

33:11.542 --> 33:13.332
You're a son of a bitch.

33:14.125 --> 33:17.375
Why? I behave myself.
I treat her like a queen.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.880
- Like you do all the girls you fuck.
- Sure, I'm a gentleman.

33:21.750 --> 33:22.920
Thanks.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.960
Look, Manel.

33:27.792 --> 33:31.712
I think you need to relax
and give Elena time.

33:31.958 --> 33:34.628
Play it cool, make her miss you.

33:34.750 --> 33:38.750
Go out more, go to the gym,
meet women too...

33:39.417 --> 33:43.037
It won't matter,
the scale is already tipped.

33:43.125 --> 33:46.495
I think Elena and I have reached
our peak of happiness.

33:46.708 --> 33:49.078
Damn, with that attitude
no wonder she got spooked.

33:49.208 --> 33:52.038
It's not an attitude, it's science.
It's in the books.

33:52.208 --> 33:55.708
You don't know because all you think
about is getting laid, but the initial

33:55.792 --> 33:58.962
conditions within a system
are what determine its evolution.

33:59.083 --> 33:59.963
Huh?

34:00.083 --> 34:01.083
What?

34:01.250 --> 34:04.330
It's very simple. We have a system and
two parts with different temperatures.

34:05.958 --> 34:09.498
So the second law of thermodynamics
is already set in motion.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.210
What was the second law?

34:39.458 --> 34:41.038
Why aren't you answering?

34:56.208 --> 34:58.078
<i>But what is entropy?</i>

34:58.833 --> 35:01.253
<i>Get ready to understand
once and for all</i>

35:01.417 --> 35:03.977
<i>something you'll never forget.</i>
How hard is it to send a message?

36:10.292 --> 36:11.422
There's someone else.

36:31.333 --> 36:32.883
<i>But there's still more.</i>

36:33.417 --> 36:35.127
<i>There's another way
to look at entropy</i>

36:35.292 --> 36:38.712
<i>and it's even more troubling,
even more devastating.</i>

36:39.875 --> 36:42.125
I was up all night
gluing it back together.

36:42.292 --> 36:43.792
You didn't have to.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.250
It doesn't look so bad.

36:47.875 --> 36:50.455
- After all you went through to...
- It's okay.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.165
It has even more personality now.

36:55.708 --> 36:57.708
It wasn't such a pretty sculpture.

36:59.625 --> 37:02.495
I can't see you this week, Manel,
I'll be too busy with the short film.

37:05.667 --> 37:08.997
You can visit me on the set,
but I can't spend any time with you.

37:09.125 --> 37:11.035
You're leaving already?
You just got here.

37:11.167 --> 37:13.287
I'm sorry, I can't stay.
I have a rehearsal.

37:13.917 --> 37:15.917
- Is everything okay?
- I don't know.

37:16.083 --> 37:17.583
Is everything okay?

37:18.542 --> 37:20.712
You didn't answer my messages
yesterday.

37:20.875 --> 37:23.745
I didn't. Wow. I'm sorry I'm so busy.

37:23.833 --> 37:25.583
- Really.
- Is that all?

37:25.875 --> 37:27.535
That's all. Don't freak out.

37:28.125 --> 37:31.915
You might be going a little fast
for me. But everything's fine, okay?

37:32.500 --> 37:36.630
See you on Sunday. Come up with
some law of physics to explain to me.

37:37.458 --> 37:38.578
Wish me luck.

37:38.792 --> 37:39.962
Good luck.

38:17.833 --> 38:21.173
Hi, excuse me.
I'm here to see Elena, I'm Manel.

38:21.250 --> 38:23.920
Manel? Manel who?
They already left.

38:24.042 --> 38:26.082
But they told me they were here
ten minutes ago.

38:26.208 --> 38:29.918
They're shooting the rest of the day
somewhere else, like two hours away.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.495
Maybe we could do a threesome.

39:09.875 --> 39:12.035
PHASE 2

39:15.958 --> 39:17.288
I don't mean to...

39:17.875 --> 39:21.955
I <i> didn't</i> mean to startle you,
but I must say that your thesis

39:22.083 --> 39:24.213
is coming along more slowly
than expected.

39:24.375 --> 39:25.825
It sucks.

39:26.083 --> 39:28.383
It could also be expressed
that way, yes.

39:29.917 --> 39:31.827
Right now a lot of people
are working

39:31.958 --> 39:33.998
on thermodynamics
in complex systems.

39:34.167 --> 39:36.747
If you don't hurry up,
someone might beat you to it.

39:36.833 --> 39:39.293
I'm sick of thermodynamics
and complex systems.

39:41.125 --> 39:43.495
Did you know that
a large number of physicists

39:43.708 --> 39:46.668
who developed thermodynamics
committed suicide?

39:47.500 --> 39:50.380
Or even worse, they tried unsuccessfully.

39:51.042 --> 39:54.292
Some even lost their wives
and children while trying.

39:54.833 --> 39:56.963
The statistics are staggering.

39:57.083 --> 39:58.883
No, I didn't know.

39:59.792 --> 40:02.082
I'm telling you because you don't
look very enthusiastic.

40:03.250 --> 40:06.920
- I'm just tired. A bad night.
- Anyway,

40:07.042 --> 40:10.332
I only wanted to tell you that
your thesis is very promising,

40:10.500 --> 40:13.670
but you mustn't lose your edge.

40:15.250 --> 40:18.040
We're anxiously awaiting
your results.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.833
<i>I'll tell you about my night.</i>

40:21.208 --> 40:24.878
<i>Remember, we're talking about disorder
and lost energy here.</i>

40:27.708 --> 40:30.578
Have a seat! This is ready
and it gets cold fast!

40:31.458 --> 40:32.538
Hello?

40:34.333 --> 40:35.633
Shit, it's overdone.

40:36.625 --> 40:39.018
I'm sorry, I was in a hurry
and everything came out backwards.

40:39.042 --> 40:41.002
- If you'd told me a little sooner...
- Hi.

40:42.083 --> 40:43.633
Go on, sit down.

40:44.250 --> 40:47.380
It won't be great.
What are you drinking, wine?

40:47.542 --> 40:50.422
- I brought you a bottle.
- Open it and I'll start serving.

41:06.250 --> 41:08.250
I have a casting for a movie on Monday.

41:08.750 --> 41:12.880
I'm a little nervous,
so let's not get overwhelmed, okay?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.790
I'll help you clean up after.

41:14.958 --> 41:17.828
Yeah, okay. I just wanted
everything to be perfect

41:17.917 --> 41:20.167
- when you got here.
- I came to see you.

41:20.333 --> 41:22.713
And I'm sure your dinner is great.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.540
Wait, let me get this.

41:35.042 --> 41:39.172
My love, let's have dinner
and have a nice chat.

41:41.208 --> 41:42.828
- Okay?
- Okay.

41:47.458 --> 41:48.828
I'll make coffee.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.210
I'm not finished yet.

41:52.375 --> 41:54.325
That way it'll be ready
when you are.

41:57.208 --> 41:59.958
I'll clear the table while I'm at it.

42:19.083 --> 42:22.253
It's not the smoke, it's the smell
of food, it's too stuffy in here.

42:32.250 --> 42:34.080
I love this song.

42:34.917 --> 42:37.037
I'll turn it down a bit,
you hear everything up here.

42:37.208 --> 42:39.788
At least until we close the windows.
I'll do that in a second.

42:39.958 --> 42:41.958
Don't take the wine. Please.

42:42.333 --> 42:43.753
Yeah, right, sorry.

42:48.875 --> 42:50.375
You're fascinating, you know that?

42:51.708 --> 42:52.918
Look at your home.

42:53.042 --> 42:55.292
Your books arranged by subjects,

42:55.458 --> 42:57.628
your figures always perfectly placed,

42:57.833 --> 43:00.333
your pajamas neatly folded
by the bed...

43:01.500 --> 43:02.750
I admire you.

43:02.958 --> 43:04.418
I really do.

43:08.583 --> 43:11.963
But my love,
I think you need a little...

43:12.458 --> 43:13.878
What was this called again?

43:15.167 --> 43:16.167
Entropy?

43:18.583 --> 43:19.753
Sorry.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.130
I'm sorry!

43:24.958 --> 43:25.958
Wow.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.630
I wouldn't just call it entropy.

43:28.833 --> 43:31.173
I'd also call it... joy!

43:31.333 --> 43:33.583
Joy!

43:34.417 --> 43:35.827
What are you doing?

43:36.500 --> 43:38.000
- Will you stop?
- Joy!

43:38.167 --> 43:39.957
- Calm down for a second!
- Fly!

43:40.500 --> 43:41.790
Elena, please...

43:41.958 --> 43:43.958
Not the drawers... Okay, okay...

43:44.083 --> 43:45.803
- I was dying to do this.
- We have to talk.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.418
No, not the books, they're in order...

43:50.583 --> 43:52.753
- Come on, be happy with me.
- No, hold on.

43:52.917 --> 43:54.997
Wait, let's talk... Damn

43:55.625 --> 43:58.745
I'll stop cleaning up, I promise!

43:58.917 --> 44:01.837
That's enough, knock it off! <i>- We can't sleep, damn it!</i>
- Elena, please...

44:02.083 --> 44:04.463
<i>Some people have to work!</i>

44:04.625 --> 44:06.495
- Sorry!
- Come here...

44:06.708 --> 44:08.378
Let me free you, Mr. Scientific Method!

44:08.542 --> 44:09.752
Elena, let me go!

44:09.917 --> 44:11.627
You're repressed, don't you see?

44:14.750 --> 44:16.960
What's your problem?
You spoiled brat!

44:17.750 --> 44:20.830
You see? You never think
of the consequences!

44:20.917 --> 44:23.877
It's better than being 15 moves
ahead all the time!

44:24.000 --> 44:26.330
You've got Kasparov Syndrome!

44:26.500 --> 44:27.920
Yeah? And what's your thing called?

44:28.042 --> 44:30.172
When people only care
about themselves?

44:30.333 --> 44:32.003
Don't change the subject,
Mr. Method.

44:32.167 --> 44:34.327
You're turning into a pain in the ass!

44:34.500 --> 44:36.000
Oh, yeah. It's called "egocentritis."

44:36.167 --> 44:38.497
When your ego is bigger
than your head.

44:38.708 --> 44:40.828
What am I doing here
with a stick in the mud like you?

44:40.917 --> 44:42.517
You're here because
nobody can stand you.

44:42.625 --> 44:45.415
Your ego absorbs everything
like a black hole.

44:45.583 --> 44:46.963
And yours doesn't?

44:47.125 --> 44:50.245
All you want is for me to follow
you around like a puppy dog.

44:57.542 --> 45:00.082
Oh, great.
Now you're leaving, right?

45:00.250 --> 45:02.309
I think that's enough disorder
to keep you busy for a while.

45:02.333 --> 45:03.923
You see? That's what you're like.

45:04.042 --> 45:06.962
Things get messy and you
leave me here to clean it up.

45:07.083 --> 45:08.423
It's your mess.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.542
Give me the key, please.

45:12.792 --> 45:14.962
I gave you a copy, remember?

45:15.458 --> 45:18.248
I lost it, I forgot to tell you.
Will you please open the door?

45:18.375 --> 45:20.745
You lost the key to my flat?

45:20.958 --> 45:24.328
Great. Well, I don't know
where I put mine, I'm sorry.

45:24.500 --> 45:27.540
No,<i> I'm</i> sorry,
for being so clumsy...

45:27.875 --> 45:31.035
Please, go ahead and leave.
Everything is fine.

45:31.208 --> 45:33.038
Thanks for coming,
it was a pleasure.

45:33.208 --> 45:35.828
No, thank you, I had a blast.
You're a laugh a minute.

45:35.958 --> 45:37.998
You're too kind!

45:38.167 --> 45:41.377
No, really. I love being with you.
I'm going to miss you so much.

45:41.542 --> 45:42.382
Me too!

45:42.542 --> 45:44.422
I love you!

45:53.292 --> 45:56.332
Damn it!
I am such a fucking idiot!

46:01.208 --> 46:02.248
What was that?

46:03.917 --> 46:08.327
That was thermodynamics
reacting on my coffee pot.

46:18.833 --> 46:20.083
Thanks.

46:26.792 --> 46:29.542
I'll help you clean up, okay?

46:30.000 --> 46:31.750
No. Don't even think about it.

46:31.917 --> 46:33.877
Yes, we both did this.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.580
No, you have to get up
early tomorrow.

46:35.792 --> 46:38.502
I said I want to help you clean up!

46:38.708 --> 46:41.538
- No, damn it, I don't want you to.
- Why wouldn't you want me to?

46:41.750 --> 46:44.040
- Because you clean badly!
- I know!

48:25.625 --> 48:28.875
No, I'm okay. It's fine,
we'll hook up another time.

48:29.542 --> 48:31.832
Yeah, don't worry, we'll talk later.

48:31.958 --> 48:34.078
I'm fine. You do your thing.

48:34.875 --> 48:36.745
Everything's fine, really.

48:36.917 --> 48:39.127
It's just a little dog shit
that got stuck in my hair

48:39.292 --> 48:42.172
when I fell headfirst into shit
because I was chasing you

48:42.333 --> 48:46.253
like I do all the fucking time
while you do your own fucking thing!

48:46.667 --> 48:47.747
Fuck!

48:49.167 --> 48:50.167
Sorry.

48:50.208 --> 48:52.668
You don't deserve me, you bastard!

48:53.292 --> 48:54.752
You don't...

48:54.917 --> 48:56.627
Oh, yes, yes, like that!

48:57.083 --> 48:59.213
This is all you want me for.

48:59.375 --> 49:01.625
You only want me for sex, damn it!

49:02.958 --> 49:04.828
I'm going to leave you...

49:04.958 --> 49:07.958
I swear, I'm going to leave you...

49:08.458 --> 49:10.328
Bastard, I swear I'm going to...

49:10.500 --> 49:12.960
I'm going to... I'm going to...

49:14.583 --> 49:18.583
leave... you... you... you.

49:25.250 --> 49:27.040
I got the part!

49:27.292 --> 49:28.132
What part?

49:28.292 --> 49:30.132
Remember the casting I did?

49:30.292 --> 49:31.292
Oh, right.

49:31.417 --> 49:35.707
I'm so happy! In two months
I'll be shooting a movie!

49:35.875 --> 49:37.745
I'm sorry, we'll have to cancel
our vacation.

49:38.417 --> 49:41.167
Isn't it incredible?
The director called me to tell me!

49:41.333 --> 49:43.883
Daniel Sánchez Arévalo.
What's this?

49:44.042 --> 49:45.922
It was to say I'm sorry.

49:46.083 --> 49:47.583
Sorry? What for?

49:47.792 --> 49:49.712
Hey, I can't stay home tonight.

49:49.875 --> 49:52.785
I'm meeting the director and some
people from the crew to celebrate.

49:52.958 --> 49:53.788
You can sleep over

49:53.958 --> 49:55.518
but I don't know what time
I'll be back.

49:55.625 --> 49:58.205
No, that's okay,
I have things to do at home.

49:58.375 --> 50:00.285
- Okay. You're not mad?
- No.

50:00.750 --> 50:04.630
Why don't you make something
to drink while I get dressed?

50:04.833 --> 50:06.173
I need a drink!

50:20.292 --> 50:22.882
<i>Entropy advances slowly.</i>

50:23.958 --> 50:26.378
<i>Sometimes it's nearly impossible
to detect.</i>

50:26.708 --> 50:27.708
<i>But it's unstoppable.</i>

50:38.750 --> 50:40.540
<i>To eliminate it, you'd have to stop</i>

50:40.625 --> 50:42.575
<i>particles in motion,</i>

50:43.500 --> 50:46.290
<i>fix them somehow
to some unalterable structure.</i>

50:46.917 --> 50:50.627
<i>And even then you'd never be able
to eliminate it completely.</i>

50:59.958 --> 51:01.878
<i>Sooner or later,</i>

51:02.958 --> 51:06.078
<i>entropy destroys the efficiency of the
system... and the machine stops working.</i>

51:16.125 --> 51:19.285
I think we should give ourselves
some time.

51:21.250 --> 51:23.710
<i>And even though one formula
calculates entropy</i>

51:23.875 --> 51:25.995
in terms of probability

51:26.167 --> 51:28.827
and the other in terms of energy,

51:28.917 --> 51:31.787
even calculating such different things,

51:31.958 --> 51:34.128
the results match.

51:34.792 --> 51:36.422
Isn't that fascinating?

51:37.542 --> 51:38.832
No?

51:39.875 --> 51:41.495
I don't get it, teach.

51:41.875 --> 51:44.075
You know me, I study all the time,

51:44.167 --> 51:46.497
but thermodynamics is too much for me.

51:46.708 --> 51:48.168
What is it you don't get?

51:48.250 --> 51:51.210
Any of it. To start with,
I don't get the point of any of this.

51:51.292 --> 51:53.382
Maybe you don't get it

51:53.542 --> 51:56.632
because you've missed
a subtle but important detail.

51:56.833 --> 52:01.043
That all of this doesn't only affect
the substances we use in the laboratory.

52:01.583 --> 52:03.753
It affects you, it affects me,

52:03.833 --> 52:05.883
it affects everyone.

52:06.375 --> 52:07.955
The second law of thermodynamics

52:08.042 --> 52:10.882
explains why a glass you drop
smashes into pieces on the floor

52:10.958 --> 52:13.878
but if you drop the pieces
they don't form a glass.

52:13.958 --> 52:16.958
It explains why machines
stop working if you don't use them,

52:17.083 --> 52:18.963
why sand castles never last

52:19.125 --> 52:22.205
and why we always end up
forgetting everything.

52:22.375 --> 52:24.035
It explains why what you wanted to do

52:24.208 --> 52:26.378
becomes the mess you end up making

52:26.542 --> 52:30.042
and why your girlfriend gets bored
with you and finds someone else.

52:30.208 --> 52:32.828
It even explains why
we can't go back in time

52:32.958 --> 52:35.458
and fix the things
we screwed up with her.

52:35.625 --> 52:38.575
It explains practically everything
you do wrong.

52:38.792 --> 52:40.712
Because it applies to all systems,

52:40.875 --> 52:43.955
starting with the universe itself
and ending with your own life

52:44.125 --> 52:46.955
and the shitty social system
you're wasting away in.

52:50.208 --> 52:51.328
Think about it.

52:52.208 --> 52:54.378
Bring me a book report next week.

53:11.250 --> 53:14.750
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

53:17.958 --> 53:19.538
No, damn it!

53:23.958 --> 53:25.128
No, damn it! Elena?

53:34.125 --> 53:37.535
No, this isn't
Procrastinators Anonymous.

54:22.292 --> 54:26.082
<i>Sadly, my friends,
in the very long term</i>

54:26.208 --> 54:28.958
<i>there won't even be super-massive
and wonderful beings like Elena</i>

54:29.042 --> 54:30.502
<i>to make us suffer.</i>

54:32.125 --> 54:33.955
<i>But we're getting ahead
of ourselves again.</i>

54:41.708 --> 54:43.578
<i>Let's go back one more time</i>

54:44.542 --> 54:46.712
<i>to understand
what really happened,</i>

54:49.167 --> 54:52.167
<i>where classical physics
started going wrong</i>

54:52.333 --> 54:54.713
<i>and brought us to the current
state of things.</i>

55:12.708 --> 55:15.748
Hey, hi! Great!

55:15.833 --> 55:17.503
- And you?
- Great.

55:17.708 --> 55:21.578
Manel, this is Lorenzo.
He's my co-star in the movie.

55:21.958 --> 55:23.328
- How are you?
- Fine.

55:32.042 --> 55:34.212
Pablo... Pablo!

55:34.750 --> 55:35.960
Eva! Eva!

55:37.833 --> 55:38.963
Over here!

55:39.333 --> 55:40.333
Pablo!

55:40.792 --> 55:41.792
Eva!

55:42.125 --> 55:43.535
Sweetie, call him!

55:44.292 --> 55:45.962
Look who's there!

56:04.958 --> 56:06.708
He's so crazy!

56:06.875 --> 56:09.165
I don't understand how Eva
goes along with it.

56:12.042 --> 56:13.792
Over here!

56:14.083 --> 56:15.713
Pablo!

56:20.125 --> 56:21.455
Handsome!

56:34.333 --> 56:36.133
<i>Let's consider an event.</i>

56:36.542 --> 56:39.462
<i>In this case, it will happen
in about eight seconds.</i>

56:40.083 --> 56:42.333
<i>And let's suppose we have
two observers,</i>

56:42.500 --> 56:45.710
<i>one standing still and the other
in motion with respect to the event.</i>

56:55.208 --> 56:58.378
<i>Let's see how each one
observes the event.</i>

57:00.500 --> 57:02.420
<i>From the girlfriend's point of view,</i>

57:02.542 --> 57:05.132
<i>Pablo falls in a straight line
towards the ground.</i>

57:08.625 --> 57:10.165
<i>For his lover, however,</i>

57:10.333 --> 57:12.543
<i>since the bus is moving,</i>

57:12.750 --> 57:14.830
<i>Pablo falls following a curve.</i>

57:18.833 --> 57:22.423
<i>The curve is obviously longer
than the straight line,</i>

57:22.500 --> 57:26.960
<i>so his lover will see him fall
at a greater speed than his girlfriend.</i>

57:55.750 --> 57:57.790
I felt like I was in the air forever.

57:58.583 --> 57:59.833
Does it hurt a lot?

57:59.958 --> 58:03.828
What were you thinking, son?
How could you fall off a bus?

58:04.708 --> 58:05.958
Where is Eva?

58:06.083 --> 58:06.883
Okay, everyone.

58:06.958 --> 58:10.128
I have to wash him.
This can be very unpleasant.

58:10.292 --> 58:12.962
- What should we do?
- Leave.

58:13.250 --> 58:16.130
Go outside and shut the door,
I'm going to scream.

58:17.292 --> 58:19.382
Can you ask Eva
to come and help, please?

58:19.542 --> 58:20.882
I'm right here.

58:31.917 --> 58:33.497
For me the week flew by!

58:33.583 --> 58:35.503
You're leaving already? You just got here.

58:35.583 --> 58:37.183
You might be going a little fast for me.

58:37.250 --> 58:38.330
But everything's fine.

59:18.250 --> 59:19.540
<i>Just to clarify:</i>

59:19.750 --> 59:23.830
<i>Falling in love has the same effect
as running faster than you're supposed to.</i>

59:24.208 --> 59:28.168
<i>In both cases, your heart races
and wants to jump out of your mouth.</i>

59:45.333 --> 59:46.423
Hi, Manel.

59:46.583 --> 59:47.583
Hi.

59:47.708 --> 59:49.958
We agreed not to speak,
that we needed to reflect.

59:50.042 --> 59:53.292
Yeah, but I wanted to say
that I've reflected.

59:53.708 --> 59:54.748
A lot.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.540
And I can't bear the thought

59:56.667 --> 59:59.497
of losing you. I'll do anything
you want not to lose you.

59:59.625 --> 01:00:00.995
I know, Manel, but...

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:03.415
that's not how it works.

01:00:03.958 --> 01:00:07.288
The scene you made the other day...
That's not the Manel I like.

01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:10.963
I like the one from the beginning,
before you started freaking out.

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.582
I think you need to keep reflecting.

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.000
<i>In other words,
stars like Elena deform</i>

01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:52.285
<i>the spacetime around them
with their mere presence.</i>

01:00:52.542 --> 01:00:55.082
<i>And planets like Manel
think they're free</i>

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:56.540
<i>and moving in a straight line</i>

01:00:56.792 --> 01:00:58.542
<i>when they're actually trapped,</i>

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:00.380
<i>orbiting around their star.</i>

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.040
I'm fine, really.

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:04.578
I feel awesome.

01:01:04.792 --> 01:01:06.882
I don't even miss her anymore.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.170
My life is finally straightening out.

01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:32.078
Did you know that quantum physics
started when a scientist...

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.170
Ernest Rutherford was his name...

01:01:34.333 --> 01:01:38.383
got the idea to imagine the atom
like a miniature solar system,

01:01:38.542 --> 01:01:41.832
with particles orbiting around each other?

01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:44.875
What a son of a bitch.

01:01:47.833 --> 01:01:51.753
<i>Let's consider Elena and Manel again
as a system of subatomic particles.</i>

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.997
<i>The evolution of his visits to her flat</i>

01:01:55.167 --> 01:01:58.627
<i>will serve as an example
of the implausible quantum laws.</i>

01:02:16.042 --> 01:02:18.792
I got an urgent job, I'll see you tonight!

01:02:18.875 --> 01:02:19.705
OPTION 1

01:02:19.833 --> 01:02:21.003
OPTION 2

01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:24.325
I was thinking you could have
keys to my place as well.

01:02:24.417 --> 01:02:25.167
OPTION 3

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:27.500
Use the keys I gave you!
Dinner is burning!

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:37.245
OPTION 1

01:02:37.583 --> 01:02:39.923
Happy birthday, Mr. Method!

01:02:40.417 --> 01:02:42.457
OPTION 2

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.580
Did you check if dinner is burning?

01:02:48.792 --> 01:02:50.712
OPTION 3

01:02:53.292 --> 01:02:54.922
What are you doing?

01:02:55.125 --> 01:02:55.875
Sorry!

01:02:55.958 --> 01:02:58.328
Even if you have keys,
you can ring the doorbell first!

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.000
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:03:33.208 --> 01:03:34.628
<i>But the uncertainty arises</i>

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:37.748
<i>not only from the fact
that you can't know what it's doing,</i>

01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:40.382
<i>but from something
much more disturbing.</i>

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.790
What are you doing?

01:04:00.583 --> 01:04:01.833
What did you say?

01:04:02.333 --> 01:04:03.963
What are you doing?

01:04:13.375 --> 01:04:15.915
What, you want details about
what I do in the bathroom?

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:30.958
And your cell phone?

01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:33.463
I left it in the bathroom.

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:34.915
You're going to leave it there?

01:04:35.042 --> 01:04:38.882
Do you mind?
Do you want me to go get it?

01:04:44.417 --> 01:04:46.827
<i>But this phenomenon
is merely a consequence</i>

01:04:46.958 --> 01:04:48.788
<i>of the deepest
and most terrifying truth</i>

01:04:48.958 --> 01:04:50.958
<i>presented by quantum physics:</i>

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.498
<i>wave-particle duality.</i>

01:05:55.833 --> 01:05:57.253
What did you do last night?

01:05:58.375 --> 01:05:59.375
Why?

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:01.785
You were with Lorenzo, right?

01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:04.543
Are you seriously asking me?

01:06:04.792 --> 01:06:06.422
You were with Lorenzo.

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:09.133
I was with you.

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:11.535
Please, don't change the subject.

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:12.880
I was with you!

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.290
I don't care if you were with me!
You fucked him! Go on, say it!

01:06:16.458 --> 01:06:19.078
You fucked him!

01:06:22.458 --> 01:06:24.538
<i>Normally I'm not like this, you know.</i>

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.830
<i>But there's something
I haven't told you yet.</i>

01:06:28.708 --> 01:06:31.288
<i>Let's go back to my visits
to Elena's flat</i>

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:33.458
<i>so you can finally understand
what happened.</i>

01:06:48.167 --> 01:06:50.928
Manel, we have to have a serious talk.
You were shitting yourself, eh?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.710
I got an urgent job,
I'll see you tonight!

01:07:04.875 --> 01:07:06.125
I got the part!

01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:14.538
<i>But studying a sufficient number
of particles</i>

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:17.130
<i>is the same as studying
the same particle</i>

01:07:17.292 --> 01:07:19.212
<i>a sufficient number of times.</i>

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:20.543
Manel!

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:23.040
<i>And relationships in particular</i>

01:07:23.208 --> 01:07:25.538
<i>offer us enough time
to study the particle</i>

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.920
<i>a lot of times.</i>

01:07:31.417 --> 01:07:34.287
<i>At the exact moment
you observe the particle,</i>

01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:37.378
<i>the cloud and the rest
of the possibilities disappear.</i>

01:07:38.083 --> 01:07:40.633
<i>The particle stops behaving
like a wave</i>

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:43.580
<i>and it's really doing what you see.</i>

01:08:09.917 --> 01:08:11.827
Lorenzo is hot.

01:08:12.292 --> 01:08:15.632
He hasn't stopped hitting on me
since we met

01:08:15.833 --> 01:08:17.633
and he's hot.

01:08:17.832 --> 01:08:19.252
You already said that.

01:08:20.875 --> 01:08:22.415
I flirt with him too.

01:08:22.582 --> 01:08:25.082
Sometimes I've even thought
about fucking him.

01:08:25.417 --> 01:08:27.537
Especially when I'm having doubts
about you.

01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:31.285
But I don't fall in love with
someone because he's hot

01:08:31.457 --> 01:08:33.828
and I don't want a boyfriend
who's a model or an actor.

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:35.410
That's the last thing I want.

01:08:36.125 --> 01:08:39.375
I want someone who thinks
about other things,

01:08:40.167 --> 01:08:42.787
about things more important
than ourselves,

01:08:42.957 --> 01:08:45.627
who doesn't spend all day
seducing people

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:47.417
or have an ego bigger
than his own head.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:49.502
- Like yours.
- Like mine, yeah.

01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:53.827
I want a boyfriend who explains
weird things to me,

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:57.957
over and over again because
I don't understand them

01:08:58.125 --> 01:09:00.245
and nobody else does either,
but I love it.

01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:04.792
A thermodynamic boyfriend
who I can call Mr. Method.

01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:09.962
A clean freak who makes me
show up on time

01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:13.625
and watch documentaries
and go to bed early.

01:09:13.875 --> 01:09:16.535
Even if he always falls asleep
before I do.

01:09:17.792 --> 01:09:21.292
Don't give up yet,
just be a little patient with me.

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:23.542
Okay?

01:09:37.792 --> 01:09:41.131
<i>But don't be fooled by her
sensationalist little speech.</i>

01:09:42.125 --> 01:09:46.075
<i>The course of our relationship
would have been marked anyway.</i>

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.250
That money is mine, rookie!

01:09:55.375 --> 01:09:56.495
Cut!

01:09:56.708 --> 01:10:00.248
<i>They say quantum physics
put an end to scientific determinism.</i>

01:10:00.417 --> 01:10:01.417
Elena!

01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:03.578
<i>But that's nothing but
a wrong assessment.</i>

01:10:03.792 --> 01:10:04.792
You were perfect.

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:08.250
<i>Probability, let's repeat,</i>

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:12.075
<i>is just as determinant over time
as the most exact of all laws.</i>

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.250
<i>It's infallible.</i>

01:10:13.875 --> 01:10:16.915
<i>And even worse, it leaves you
with no weapons to fight it.</i>

01:10:17.583 --> 01:10:18.833
Good, you?

01:10:20.625 --> 01:10:24.705
<i>In the end, probability
always puts you in your place.</i>

01:10:32.292 --> 01:10:35.922
<i>Especially when you can't see
where the other particle is.</i>

01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:43.205
<i>Which takes us back to
the second law of thermodynamics.</i>

01:10:48.333 --> 01:10:52.213
<i>Why do you think entropy always
marks the worst direction possible?</i>

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.960
<i>Because the chances of things
turning out the way you want</i>

01:10:56.833 --> 01:10:59.083
<i>are ridiculous compared to
the chances they won't.</i>

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:01.880
I don't care if you were with me!
You fucked him!

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Go on, say it!

01:11:03.167 --> 01:11:05.207
You fucked him!

01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:09.128
<i>The chances of the other particles</i>

01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:13.208
<i>being where you want them to be
will always be extremely small.</i>

01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:18.248
I think we should give
ourselves some time.

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:21.785
I need to reflect and...

01:11:22.583 --> 01:11:24.753
and you need to reflect.

01:11:28.375 --> 01:11:31.035
<i>There's another quantum phenomenon
that clearly explains</i>

01:11:31.208 --> 01:11:34.288
<i>what happens during periods
of reflection between couples.</i>

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:39.792
<i>Or did you actually think these periods
have ever been used to reflect?</i>

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:57.130
HELLO! HOW ARE YOU?
I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU...

01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:22.168
<i>Complementary states
doesn't mean</i>

01:12:22.333 --> 01:12:24.083
they're the same, don't you see?

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.708
Fine, I'm not okay.

01:12:27.875 --> 01:12:29.075
I feel like shit.

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:33.250
And that's exactly why I know,
I'm positive that she's happy.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.790
That son of a bitch Rutherford.

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:38.290
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:41.458
- Okay, but you didn't decide that.
- Fine.

01:12:46.417 --> 01:12:49.327
Look, Manel.
We've been friends for a long time.

01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:52.878
I've always listened to your theories
and I've even shown interest.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.710
But I can't take it anymore.
You're a pain in the ass.

01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:58.415
Thanks, buddy.
That's just what I needed to hear.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:01.383
Maybe it is.
Your determinism stinks.

01:13:01.542 --> 01:13:04.832
Since everything is determined,
nothing is up to you.

01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:06.458
You leave no room for free will.

01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:09.625
Free will is an illusion,
I already told you that.

01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:12.253
It might be an illusion,
but people keep fucking each other.

01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:14.038
Look at Eva.

01:13:14.208 --> 01:13:17.748
She had it much worse than you
with Elena, but she never gave up.

01:13:17.917 --> 01:13:19.077
And here we are.

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:21.670
She's had to swallow her pride
over and over again

01:13:21.792 --> 01:13:23.712
because I treated her like shit,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.710
but she hung in there
and fought for what she wanted.

01:13:26.875 --> 01:13:30.035
- I fought too.
- No, you complained, it's not the same.

01:13:30.458 --> 01:13:33.168
Eva knew I'd hooked up with
the girl from Gay Pride,

01:13:33.333 --> 01:13:35.793
and still there she was
in the hospital every day

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:37.833
taking care of me.

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:41.500
Eva is fucking awesome.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.080
Damn, Pablo.
You're really shitfaced.

01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:49.285
Tell me one thing.
Will that change anything?

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.958
Yeah. When the model came to the hospital
and she caught us...

01:13:52.083 --> 01:13:54.793
Hold on, the model caught you?

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:57.133
<i>Eva caught us.</i>

01:13:59.583 --> 01:14:01.833
<i>Then she disappeared</i>

01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:05.082
<i>and that's when I realized
how much I missed her.</i>

01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:07.418
What's up?

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:10.920
I'm sorry, you can't go in there.

01:14:11.042 --> 01:14:13.962
Hey, I said you can't...
She's in a meeting...

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:15.125
You can't...!

01:14:15.958 --> 01:14:18.248
I'm sorry, I couldn't stop him.

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:21.920
I know you don't want to see me
or talk to me.

01:14:22.042 --> 01:14:23.132
I just wanted to say

01:14:23.208 --> 01:14:27.208
I'm a jerk. I know I screwed up
and I don't deserve you, Eva.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.500
But I love you.

01:14:29.042 --> 01:14:31.212
I love you and I want
to live with you.

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.290
And if you give me a chance,

01:14:34.458 --> 01:14:36.878
I promise I will never do
what I did again.

01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:41.478
I can't live without you, Eva.
I don't want to live without you.

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:54.583
If you want me to take you back,

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:56.205
sign this.

01:14:58.417 --> 01:15:02.127
It's a contract obliging you to be
faithful with your assets as collateral.

01:15:20.958 --> 01:15:23.378
I'm kidding, you dipshit.

01:15:26.125 --> 01:15:27.875
The model is gorgeous.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.170
And the one at the parade is too,
amazing in bed.

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:33.003
But Eva has... She's...

01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:37.208
I've decided to stop fooling around
and finally settle down.

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:40.210
I know what you're going to say,
but no, I'm serious.

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:42.460
I'll tell you what you're going to say.

01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:44.575
That I'm saying this because
I'm on crutches

01:15:44.667 --> 01:15:49.077
and can barely fuck, that the accident
affected my brain,

01:15:49.292 --> 01:15:51.882
that I always said this would
never happen to me,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.330
not if I could still get women,
not before age 50,

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.460
that I see storm clouds on the horizon

01:15:56.625 --> 01:15:58.455
and I'm scared of ending up alone,

01:15:58.625 --> 01:16:02.415
that settling down means giving up,
being stingy,

01:16:02.917 --> 01:16:06.497
that it means rejecting our essence,

01:16:06.708 --> 01:16:08.708
freedom and true love,

01:16:08.917 --> 01:16:12.167
which is absolutely disgraceful,

01:16:12.958 --> 01:16:14.078
sad, pathetic...

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:16.790
No, that's not what I was going to say.

01:16:18.083 --> 01:16:20.293
What's disgraceful and pathetic?

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.830
Manel, who else?

01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:26.378
I'm telling him that he hides behind
his laws so he won't have to do anything.

01:16:26.542 --> 01:16:30.962
Manel, you give up when it's time
to give up, not before.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.630
In fact, I was thinking something
in the bathroom.

01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:37.503
That law of quantum entanglement.

01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:40.708
You say that if you change
the state of one particle,

01:16:40.875 --> 01:16:42.684
it changes the state
of the other one too, right?

01:16:42.708 --> 01:16:45.328
Then if you change yourself
to a more positive state,

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:49.830
if you take care of yourself
and surround yourself with good vibes,

01:16:50.292 --> 01:16:52.132
then maybe Elena won't be

01:16:52.292 --> 01:16:54.212
as happy and she'll start missing you.

01:16:54.417 --> 01:16:55.917
I hadn't thought of that.

01:16:56.042 --> 01:16:58.422
It might work, right?

01:16:58.583 --> 01:17:01.633
But she has to see you
like the Manel from the beginning.

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:03.790
Before you freaked out.

01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:07.955
Of course! That's what I've been
telling him all along.

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:10.575
To have fun, to go out more,
damn it.

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:15.212
To go out and get dressed up
and flirt with other chicks, right?

01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:17.330
Go to the gym,

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.630
I don't know, live a little.

01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:21.503
And have sex, right?

01:17:22.167 --> 01:17:26.077
Fuck tons of chicks,
hump as many as you can.

01:17:28.375 --> 01:17:29.625
You see, Manel?

01:17:30.583 --> 01:17:34.173
I told you, Eva is the best.
How could I not be crazy about her?

01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:37.213
You're the best.

01:17:57.917 --> 01:18:01.287
Because you already know,
or at least you should know,

01:18:01.458 --> 01:18:03.418
that thermodynamics...

01:18:03.542 --> 01:18:06.632
We know she's totally hot.
If we multiply her attractive mass

01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:10.920
by the speed of light squared,
we get an immeasurable amount of energy.

01:18:13.083 --> 01:18:15.463
LIFE IS WONDERFUL!!!

01:18:17.417 --> 01:18:18.417
Hey. Here we go.

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:36.130
Then there's the type of woman
I call a super-massive black hole.

01:18:36.292 --> 01:18:39.212
She's not just hot and totally sick,

01:18:39.292 --> 01:18:42.962
she thinks she's the center of the galaxy,
everything revolves around her.

01:18:43.083 --> 01:18:46.173
In theory she could even
become a worm hole.

01:18:46.333 --> 01:18:49.713
She can rip you out of your world
and transport you

01:18:49.875 --> 01:18:54.035
to a parallel universe.
She's the hole, I'm...

01:18:54.958 --> 01:18:56.168
the worm.

01:18:57.250 --> 01:19:00.330
Do you have a girlfriend
and you're a little burnt out?

01:19:00.875 --> 01:19:03.745
Girlfriend, me? No, no.
Yeah, okay. A few.

01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:05.747
Tons. You.

01:19:06.417 --> 01:19:07.917
What's a girlfriend?

01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:11.212
You'll tell me later. Guys are so weird.

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:14.380
Where are you taking me?

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.540
I don't know, wherever you want.

01:19:36.375 --> 01:19:37.575
Hi, Elena.

01:19:37.792 --> 01:19:39.542
Manel, hi.

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:41.790
- How are you?
- Fine, you?

01:19:41.958 --> 01:19:43.958
Fine, awesome. You?

01:19:44.083 --> 01:19:46.133
Fine, great.

01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:48.172
I'm glad to hear it. I'm great too.

01:19:48.542 --> 01:19:50.922
- This is Alba.
- Hi.

01:19:51.042 --> 01:19:53.172
- You're Elena Baocchi, right?
- Yes.

01:19:53.333 --> 01:19:56.293
Wow, I didn't know I was going
to meet a celebrity!

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:59.327
My latest fling, a student.
We're doing great.

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.710
Well, we're starting.

01:20:00.875 --> 01:20:03.915
She's barely of legal age,
but she's very smart.

01:20:04.042 --> 01:20:05.712
And we're both into science.

01:20:05.875 --> 01:20:08.415
She understands almost
everything I explain to her.

01:20:08.583 --> 01:20:09.963
Right, Alba?

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:17.583
Alba's cool.

01:20:17.708 --> 01:20:20.418
Maybe we can have
a threesome tonight.

01:20:21.208 --> 01:20:23.168
Okay, actually...

01:20:23.333 --> 01:20:25.253
it's my first time out with her.

01:20:25.417 --> 01:20:27.787
All this time reflecting is killing me.

01:20:27.958 --> 01:20:30.168
We came here because
I wanted to see you.

01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:31.875
I need to know how much longer...

01:20:32.417 --> 01:20:33.957
Do you remember Lorenzo?

01:20:35.333 --> 01:20:36.333
Hi.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.957
I remembered you taller.

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:43.705
And you didn't want a boyfriend
who was a model or actor.

01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:45.195
That's the last thing you wanted.

01:20:45.458 --> 01:20:48.378
You wanted a thermodynamic
boyfriend, remember?

01:20:48.542 --> 01:20:49.832
To explain the laws

01:20:49.917 --> 01:20:53.877
of physics to you. Well, there's still
a lot left to explain...

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.290
It was true at the time.

01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:59.580
You were nice to me, you explained
interesting things to me,

01:20:59.792 --> 01:21:02.132
we had a great time, but...

01:21:02.417 --> 01:21:04.537
But people can't always be right.

01:21:05.167 --> 01:21:07.167
Who do you mean, you or me?

01:21:07.417 --> 01:21:08.827
Manel, you have a problem.

01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:11.632
You explain things like your laws
are real,

01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:13.458
but they're only in your head.

01:21:13.875 --> 01:21:15.825
You don't see reality.

01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:18.377
I'm not a bunch of organized atoms.

01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:21.247
And the proof is I've decided
to leave you.

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:23.333
You think you've decided
to leave me.

01:21:23.792 --> 01:21:25.042
I'm sorry.

01:21:26.833 --> 01:21:29.173
I have more things in common
with Lorenzo.

01:21:30.458 --> 01:21:32.958
He helps me with work,
he gives me confidence,

01:21:33.083 --> 01:21:35.333
he's calm and sure of himself.

01:21:38.833 --> 01:21:40.173
Yeah, I get it.

01:21:41.583 --> 01:21:42.583
You're right.

01:21:46.458 --> 01:21:49.078
Although you've forgotten
one small detail.

01:21:49.583 --> 01:21:52.543
It's no coincidence that he's
another super-massive body.

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:56.000
You see?

01:21:56.083 --> 01:21:58.583
That's what I mean,
you can't control reality

01:21:58.708 --> 01:22:01.078
and you never stop trying to.

01:22:02.417 --> 01:22:05.077
When reality resists,
you try twice as hard

01:22:05.167 --> 01:22:08.707
to make it fit into your shitty laws.

01:22:08.792 --> 01:22:10.542
What? Forcing reality to fit?

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:12.580
You don't even understand
what you're saying.

01:22:27.958 --> 01:22:29.958
Hey! Aren't you going to pay?

01:22:38.417 --> 01:22:41.077
Elena, wait!

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:42.920
What do you mean, I force things?

01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:46.963
Seriously?
Pablo isn't the one you like?

01:22:47.083 --> 01:22:50.173
It's normal, he's very handsome.
Admit it, you like him more.

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:52.833
I don't mind, really,
we're great friends.

01:22:53.083 --> 01:22:54.383
You like Pablo more.

01:22:54.542 --> 01:22:57.922
Explain it to me?
How do I force reality?

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.960
This isn't going to work,
I'm telling you.

01:23:00.083 --> 01:23:02.543
I know it's the second time
we've slept together,

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:06.420
but we're totally different.
You with that job, traveling all the time,

01:23:06.542 --> 01:23:10.712
and me... You'll get bored with me
as soon as the novelty wears off.

01:23:11.208 --> 01:23:13.498
Please! Elena!

01:23:14.292 --> 01:23:17.382
The one with the hat? Are you sure
he wants to make a short film?

01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:20.708
Or maybe he wants to get
in your pants. I hope the script is good,

01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:25.042
but come on, a guy who looks
like that can't be a good writer.

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:28.747
Everything I did was because
I'm crazy about you!

01:23:34.792 --> 01:23:37.112
WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU?
WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU?

01:23:37.208 --> 01:23:40.328
And now you say I force things?

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:51.498
Come on!

01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:52.828
Elena!

01:23:52.958 --> 01:23:53.958
<i>Action!</i>

01:24:02.417 --> 01:24:03.417
Cut!

01:24:04.375 --> 01:24:06.535
Wait. Please, don't leave me.

01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:18.625
Elena...

01:24:19.917 --> 01:24:22.167
I've already left you, Manel!
I've already left you.

01:24:22.292 --> 01:24:25.212
You know why?
Because that's what you wanted.

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:28.003
You wanted this to fail
from the very beginning.

01:24:28.125 --> 01:24:31.665
Because you're incapable of winning,
you only know how to lose.

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:35.250
Because it confirms how smart you are
and how great your theories are.

01:24:35.417 --> 01:24:37.577
And I'll tell you another thing.

01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:40.748
You can't apply the laws
of physics to love!

01:24:40.833 --> 01:24:44.333
You can't! It's madness!
It's total bullshit!

01:24:44.458 --> 01:24:46.038
You can't!

01:24:54.042 --> 01:24:56.252
PHASE 3

01:25:02.042 --> 01:25:03.882
No need to pretend, Mr. Suarez.

01:25:04.417 --> 01:25:08.127
You know that the electromagnetic
field passes through walls.

01:25:08.292 --> 01:25:12.042
From my office I could detect
that today yours is a brown color,

01:25:12.208 --> 01:25:13.578
nearly black.

01:25:13.792 --> 01:25:16.752
I'm surprised I even still have
an electromagnetic field.

01:25:17.083 --> 01:25:21.293
You might lose it completely
when you hear what I have to say.

01:25:22.625 --> 01:25:24.915
You can't continue
as my teacher's assistant.

01:25:25.125 --> 01:25:29.785
University rules prohibit relations
between teachers and students.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.752
One of our pupils reported you
to the dean.

01:25:32.917 --> 01:25:35.917
- But nothing happened...
- No, there's no need to explain.

01:25:36.042 --> 01:25:38.882
Life, unfortunately,
doesn't work like science.

01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:41.250
The truth is not what matters most.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Whether it's true or not,
there's nothing you can do now.

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:48.460
Don't martyr yourself.

01:25:48.708 --> 01:25:50.708
Your pay was crap.

01:25:50.958 --> 01:25:54.248
And of course,
your classes were in line.

01:25:54.417 --> 01:25:56.327
Which means they sucked.

01:25:58.167 --> 01:26:00.787
Everything passes, Mr. Suarez.
Don't forget that.

01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:05.293
Even those personal issues
that are upsetting you so much.

01:26:05.875 --> 01:26:08.915
That law has less exceptions
than any other I know of.

01:26:10.958 --> 01:26:12.958
Would you like to have lunch
with me later?

01:26:13.583 --> 01:26:15.293
I'm not trying to make friends,

01:26:15.458 --> 01:26:17.458
I only want to make sure
you're not planning

01:26:17.625 --> 01:26:20.285
to pad the statistics
on thermodynamic suicides.

01:26:21.417 --> 01:26:24.667
Don't worry, I promise not to,
at least until I finish my thesis.

01:26:25.583 --> 01:26:27.543
I'm glad to hear it.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.540
In any case, you won't be eligible
for that statistic until it's finished.

01:27:08.792 --> 01:27:10.542
<i>There you have it, my friends.</i>

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:15.132
<i>The universe is drifting away and it's
going to leave us even more isolated.</i>

01:27:29.583 --> 01:27:30.963
<i>At one time</i>

01:27:31.042 --> 01:27:33.462
<i>all of the bodies in the universe
were very close,</i>

01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:35.745
<i>squeezed together
in the form of pure energy.</i>

01:27:59.542 --> 01:28:02.172
<i>This beautiful theory foresaw
that everyone,</i>

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:04.920
<i>even Elena and me,
would be brought back together</i>

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.960
<i>in a warm and eternal embrace.</i>

01:28:33.417 --> 01:28:35.327
<i>The Big Rip.</i>

01:28:35.583 --> 01:28:38.713
<i>At this point that ending
sounds about right to me.</i>

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:45.713
<i>The force causing this acceleration
has been called dark energy,</i>

01:28:46.083 --> 01:28:48.713
<i>basically because we don't know
what it is.</i>

01:28:48.917 --> 01:28:50.327
<i>Because it's a mystery.</i>

01:28:52.292 --> 01:28:54.922
<i>Maybe I can shed some light
on this point.</i>

01:28:56.708 --> 01:28:58.958
<i>This force that distances us</i>

01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:01.252
<i>is the same force that stopped
the Manel-body</i>

01:29:01.417 --> 01:29:03.537
<i>from truly giving himself
to the Elena-body</i>

01:29:03.625 --> 01:29:05.455
<i>and seeing things as they really were.</i>

01:29:05.625 --> 01:29:08.165
<i>It's the same force
that destroys true love</i>

01:29:08.333 --> 01:29:11.293
<i>and strengthens mediocre
relationships, makes us selfish,</i>

01:29:11.375 --> 01:29:13.415
<i>petty and suspicious.</i>

01:29:14.208 --> 01:29:15.208
Fear.

01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:18.330
<i>Fear.</i>

01:29:19.542 --> 01:29:22.332
Fear is what made me
hide behind those laws,

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.290
I see it clearly now.

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:26.578
So I wouldn't have to face
my own mistakes, my failure.

01:29:27.458 --> 01:29:28.958
Elena was right,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.130
thinking they can be applied to love
is insane.

01:29:32.292 --> 01:29:35.042
Though the coincidences
are pretty amazing, aren't they?

01:29:35.208 --> 01:29:38.168
What do you think?
I'm a mess.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:44.540
My wife looked to me like a pretty
massive star when she was young.

01:29:44.667 --> 01:29:48.457
But she didn't turn out so massive
to become a supernova.

01:29:50.292 --> 01:29:52.542
She came out a brown dwarf.

01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:55.785
So it's not that bad, right?

01:29:55.958 --> 01:29:59.998
I mean, I thought he would diagnose you
with schizophrenia or something.

01:30:00.625 --> 01:30:03.415
Are you sure you don't want
to take a look? She's tremendous.

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.140
You're the one who'll end up
schizophrenic

01:30:05.292 --> 01:30:07.372
if you keep talking to people
while looking at photos

01:30:07.417 --> 01:30:08.207
of hot women.

01:30:08.375 --> 01:30:10.785
I don't want to forget
there's a world out there.

01:30:10.958 --> 01:30:13.038
Because there's something worse
than dark energy.

01:30:13.125 --> 01:30:16.285
Shit, Pablo. I can't mix physics
with my feelings anymore.

01:30:16.417 --> 01:30:19.417
Dark matter is much worse.

01:30:19.625 --> 01:30:20.625
No!

01:30:25.958 --> 01:30:27.288
You two are having a baby?

01:30:27.458 --> 01:30:29.918
Eva was right when she said
down deep I'm a great dad.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.480
Congratulations, man! <i>We don't know</i>
<i>what dark matter is either.</i>

01:30:36.708 --> 01:30:40.208
<i>What we do know is that the universe
behaves like there was more gravity</i>

01:30:40.375 --> 01:30:43.415
<i>than corresponds to the bodies
we can see.</i>

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:46.500
<i>That means we attract
and cling to each other</i>

01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:49.498
<i>more than we should
according to how attractive we are.</i>

01:30:49.708 --> 01:30:51.168
Here's your lunch.

01:30:57.250 --> 01:30:59.830
Good lord, what am I doing?

01:31:00.125 --> 01:31:03.125
Things were going so well,
why did I have to fall in love?

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:05.632
You say that dark energy
could be fear.

01:31:05.833 --> 01:31:09.503
Well, I say that dark matter
is necessity.

01:31:09.917 --> 01:31:11.827
And necessity sucks.

01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:15.330
What I liked was entropy,
disorder.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.250
That was my territory.
And I'll tell you something else:

01:31:18.417 --> 01:31:21.957
with less entropy, there's less
freedom, because the particles

01:31:22.083 --> 01:31:24.173
are tied down!

01:31:24.458 --> 01:31:25.918
Isn't that right?

01:31:26.167 --> 01:31:27.167
Am I right or not?

01:31:27.208 --> 01:31:29.288
I don't know, I'm not listening.

01:31:30.292 --> 01:31:32.292
For God's sake!

01:31:33.458 --> 01:31:36.748
I need entropy back in my life!

01:31:51.042 --> 01:31:55.382
<i>There's still one law missing to
complete our voyage through science:</i>

01:31:55.542 --> 01:31:58.212
<i>the third principle
of thermodynamics.</i>

01:32:10.875 --> 01:32:13.075
- We'll be at the bar.
- Okay.

01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:50.955
<i>That's right,</i>

01:32:51.083 --> 01:32:53.383
<i>we'll never be able
to completely forget.</i>

01:32:53.542 --> 01:32:55.882
<i>We'll never reach that temperature
that stops</i>

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.080
<i>our atoms from vibrating
when we see her.</i>

01:32:58.542 --> 01:33:00.212
Congratulations, Elena.

01:33:03.167 --> 01:33:04.707
Thanks for coming.

01:33:04.875 --> 01:33:06.705
It was very important to me.

01:33:07.917 --> 01:33:09.417
Congratulations.

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.173
I hope you two are very happy.

01:33:11.833 --> 01:33:13.213
It's Manel, my ex.

01:33:13.375 --> 01:33:14.955
Manel, thanks for coming.

01:33:15.125 --> 01:33:16.995
I hope you enjoy the party.

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:19.750
- Elena, look who's here!
- Victor, great to see you!

01:33:19.875 --> 01:33:20.955
Congratulations, beautiful.

01:33:30.042 --> 01:33:31.832
Hi.

01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:33.250
Raquel?

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:35.828
What are you doing here?

01:33:35.958 --> 01:33:37.708
Small world, huh?

01:33:38.250 --> 01:33:39.880
I'm a friend of Lorenzo's.

01:33:40.583 --> 01:33:44.583
Well, actually we had our own
quantum entanglement.

01:33:48.542 --> 01:33:49.832
He's a good guy.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:52.125
And he's very hot.

01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:55.580
But I liked you more.

01:33:57.583 --> 01:33:58.793
<i>There you have it.</i>

01:33:59.125 --> 01:34:02.785
<i>Once thermodynamics comes
into your life, it never leaves.</i>

01:34:02.958 --> 01:34:04.788
Hey, it's Raquel!

01:34:04.958 --> 01:34:06.578
- Pablito!
- How are you?

01:34:06.792 --> 01:34:09.462
The best girlfriend
this bum ever had!

01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:12.575
This is Eva, the best girlfriend
<i>this</i> bum ever had.

01:34:12.792 --> 01:34:14.332
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:27.330
<i>Although, thanks to my therapy,
I was able to reflect</i>

01:34:27.583 --> 01:34:31.293
<i>and I've discovered the law
that truly rules over all of our actions.</i>

01:34:32.042 --> 01:34:35.422
<i>It's no doubt the most amazing law
of all time.</i>

01:34:35.917 --> 01:34:38.747
<i>But we'll leave it for next time.</i>
