04:16.907 --> 04:18.874
a plane thing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:18.909 --> 04:20.292

was there,

04:20.344 --> 04:24.212
and then this rando
was in the back.

04:24.247 --> 04:26.598
And he said,
"I'm usually the pilot,

04:26.634 --> 04:28.767
but I lost my pilot's license."

04:28.802 --> 04:30.969
and I was like, "why'd you lose
your pilot's license?"

04:31.021 --> 04:34.923
so he goes, "well, one time,
I was the helicopter pilot

04:34.942 --> 04:37.609
"for a porno
that was being made.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.395

04:40.430 --> 04:42.497
"she gave me a knobber."

04:42.533 --> 04:44.283
- she gave him a blowjob?

04:44.318 --> 04:47.369
- Well, I had never--
I was like, "what's that?"

04:47.404 --> 04:50.205
I guess the flight people--
- yeah, the faa.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.373
- Yeah.
- The people that--

04:51.408 --> 04:54.159
- they saw it
and took away his license.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.111
- Ahh!

04:56.130 --> 04:57.129
- Now I know what a knobber is,

04:57.164 --> 05:00.716
and I could have lived
without that information.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.819
- Tell me,
what's been going on?

05:03.854 --> 05:06.888
- Honestly, I moved,
like, ten days ago.

05:06.924 --> 05:09.992
And I bought a house,
and it's crazy.

05:10.027 --> 05:12.394

and dependence.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.687
I looked at a bunch of houses

23:59.605 --> 24:03.340
And we have finally
worked through them.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.142
- I saw kathy last night.
- Oh!

24:05.178 --> 24:06.360
- We had dinner
the other night.

24:06.395 --> 24:07.862
- You did?

24:07.897 --> 24:10.481
Well, the show got canceled.
- Oh, lisa.

24:10.516 --> 24:13.617
- Are you gonna be good?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.486
I just wish that you were
somewhere near here.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.488
- Well, I'm down
with the bears.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.190
- Down with the bears.
- Yeah.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.158
I'm just happy to have her
in my life again.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.526
- That fan won't plug in.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.161
- The plant?
What?

24:24.196 --> 24:27.197
- The--the fan.
- The fan won't plug in.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.166
Yes, it--
- will not plug.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.634
- Yeah, it will.
I'll get it.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.470
Okay, hold on.

24:32.505 --> 24:34.472
<i> - Oh, I have to have a fan.</i>

24:34.507 --> 24:37.391
The hum relaxes me.
<i> [fan whirring]</i>

24:37.426 --> 24:40.177
I have a very hard time
going to sleep

24:40.212 --> 24:42.263
and staying asleep.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.231
- Let me see.

24:44.267 --> 24:47.017
Kathy, the fan plugs in.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.570
You just have to actually
put it in the outlet.

24:49.605 --> 24:53.390
Honestly, sometimes I wonder,
like, how does kathy get by?

24:53.409 --> 24:55.192
Okay, I've got your fan set up.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.578
[both laughing]

24:57.613 --> 24:59.580
<i> - coming up...</i>
- I have to say,

24:59.615 --> 25:01.398
I felt really good
about our dinner.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.233
It was a nice step
in the right direction.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.335
- You were a sh--y friend
to denise.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.503
You were a sh--y friend to me.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.910
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

25:12.945 --> 25:15.513
- okay, let's get started.

25:15.548 --> 25:17.481
Okay, could I get
the salmon out?

25:17.517 --> 25:19.016
- And there goes
your lemon pepper,

25:19.051 --> 25:20.601
garlic salt, dill weed.
- Oh, this is all the stuff?

25:20.653 --> 25:22.720
Oh, amazing.
Okay, perfect.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.689
I love to entertain
and cook for my friends,

25:25.724 --> 25:28.192
<i> and I have not been able</i>
<i> to do that during quarantine.</i>

25:28.227 --> 25:30.244
So, yes, we have a chef,

25:30.279 --> 25:32.780
but I'm sorry,
you can have the night off.

25:32.832 --> 25:35.866
Okay, wash these and then
make them into eight pieces.

25:35.901 --> 25:38.636
I just need to get
the romaine lettuce cut.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.671
Is the salmon cut?
- I'm gonna do it right now.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.940
- So I'm boiling the pasta
in here, correct?

25:42.975 --> 25:44.041
Okay.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.976
- Do you know where I could
find a cheese platter?

25:46.012 --> 25:49.613
- I'll get one now.
- Thank you so much.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.465
- All right, how can I help?
What do you want me to do?

25:51.517 --> 25:52.916
- I need, like, a drink.

25:52.935 --> 25:53.918
- Do you want me
to make you a drink?

25:53.953 --> 25:55.519
That, I can do.
- Who can make drinks? Yes.

25:55.555 --> 25:56.954
Do you how to make a margarita?
No?

25:56.989 --> 25:58.689
- Yes.
- You do?

25:58.724 --> 26:00.224
I mean, I don't know
how to make a margarita.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.643
So I don't know.
- Yeah, easy.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.761
Here, cheers.
- Oh, wow, thank you.

26:04.780 --> 26:07.064
- But if you don't like it,
I can adjust.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.800
- That's so good.
Thank you so much.

26:09.835 --> 26:11.952
- Okay.
- Oh, my god, I'm impressed.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.037
And I'm a tough critic

26:13.072 --> 26:14.204
'cause I'm married
to a mexican.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.623
- You know, I'm born
and raised in la.

26:15.658 --> 26:18.142
I feel like kindred spirits
with all mexicans.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.010
- It smells good.
Oh, my god.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.245
- Doesn't it smell good?

26:21.280 --> 26:22.880
- Wait, are you
stirring onions?

26:22.915 --> 26:25.182
- Oh, you look so pretty.
- Are you stirring onions?

26:25.217 --> 26:26.917
- Oh, my god.
You guys look so cute.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.719
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you. You too.

26:28.754 --> 26:29.887
- I love that we're, like--
- what are you making?

26:29.922 --> 26:31.021
I know.
Oh, oh.

26:31.057 --> 26:34.091
- I'm making salmon, pasta,
there's a cheese platter

26:34.126 --> 26:35.993
and some salamis over there.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.811
And we'll have
a little happy hour first.

26:37.847 --> 26:39.330
- Okay, let's do it.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.198
- Hello, gorgeous.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.666
- What are you doing over here?
Oh, my god.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.835
Look how pretty this fish is.

26:44.870 --> 26:48.572
- Hello, baby!
- Hello!

26:48.608 --> 26:51.742
- Okay, I need 20 minutes
for the salmon,

26:51.777 --> 26:53.110
and then we'll boil
the noodles after.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.778
Okay, thank you.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.047
- Rinna, look at you,
all decked out.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.549
- Have a seat, mamacita.

26:58.584 --> 26:59.783
- You look really good.

26:59.818 --> 27:00.651
- Yeah, you do.
- Even with the swelling,

27:00.686 --> 27:02.653
I feel like it blew up
on the plane.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.655
- Is my nose getting fatter
by the second?

27:04.674 --> 27:05.656
- No.

27:05.691 --> 27:07.007
- It feels like it's growing
like pinocchio.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.825
- No.
- [trills]

27:08.844 --> 27:10.661
- I forget
you even had a nose job.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.297
On the plane, I noticed it
blowing up a little too.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.866
You know, it does that.
- [laughs]

27:15.901 --> 27:17.868
- people think I look younger
with my nose like this.

27:17.903 --> 27:18.936
- And then next year,

27:18.971 --> 27:20.838
we'll snip
a little bit more off.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.839
And then you're gonna start
with the ears.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.274
- Now I gotta worry
about my ears?

27:24.310 --> 27:25.309
- Well, you don't have
to worry about it

27:25.344 --> 27:26.877
when you're dead, though.

27:26.912 --> 27:28.195
- Yeah, but until I'm dead,

27:28.230 --> 27:30.047
I wanna be cute,
garcelle--sutton.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.382
- It's--
- why do I always do that?

27:31.417 --> 27:33.617
- What?
Talk about your death?

27:33.653 --> 27:35.285
- No, I just
called you garcelle.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.955
- Garcelle.
- I called her kyle.

27:37.990 --> 27:38.989
- I know, right?

27:39.025 --> 27:40.874
I mean, garcelle and I
had a laugh about that.

27:40.910 --> 27:43.260
- This is kathy.
This is kathy.

27:43.295 --> 27:46.363
"kyle? Kyle?
Oh, my god.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.165
"hi, honey.
Oh!

27:48.200 --> 27:50.250
You look so much like kyle."

27:50.302 --> 27:52.035
- how are you?
- Good. How are you?

27:52.054 --> 27:53.270
- Wait, I thought
you were kyle.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.805
- [laughs]
- I'm not kidding.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.074
- I get that all the time.

27:57.109 --> 28:00.260
- With the long dark hair,
is it uncanny?

28:00.312 --> 28:02.079
Unbelievable!
[laughter]

28:02.114 --> 28:03.647
- but I don't look that little.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.933
- That is so kathy hilton.

28:05.985 --> 28:09.886
- I don't know why I thought
it was kyle.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.905
I mean, kyle's so much shorter.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.240
Somebody's saying hi to me,
and I don't--

28:13.275 --> 28:14.425
I can't see who they are.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.526
- My husband does that too.

28:15.561 --> 28:17.861
Someone will come up
and have a full conversation.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.363
And I know that he doesn't know
who they are

28:19.398 --> 28:21.899
because he doesn't say,
"hey, have you met erika?"

28:21.934 --> 28:23.233
- right.
- So I'm always like--

28:23.269 --> 28:25.669
- do you ever just go, like--
I'll be like, "hi, I'm lisa."

28:25.705 --> 28:28.439
- yes, and then I save him.
And then he goes, "oh, yeah!"

28:28.474 --> 28:29.940
and then I'll walk off.
I'll go, "who's that?"

28:29.975 --> 28:31.308
he goes, "I have no idea.
Keep going."

28:31.343 --> 28:32.676
- same.
- That's harry!

28:32.712 --> 28:33.877
[fire alarm beeps]

28:33.912 --> 28:35.145
- oh, my god, my food!
- Oh, my god.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.146
- Kyle!
- It's burning.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.297
- That's it.

28:37.349 --> 28:38.766
- Do you need some help?

28:38.801 --> 28:41.185
- Oh, sh--.
Sh--.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.088
It's gonna be--oh, my god.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.122
[laughs]

28:45.157 --> 28:47.124
<i> my first meal out of the gate,</i>

28:47.159 --> 28:49.259
and I've set the salmon
on fire.

28:49.278 --> 28:51.295
- We need a towel or something.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.163
- Omg.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.982
- And maybe the kitchen too.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.167
I cannot believe this happened.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.802
- Jeez, I'm so glad
you cooked tonight.

28:58.838 --> 28:59.870
- You know what, ----er?

28:59.905 --> 29:00.954
[laughter]

29:00.990 --> 29:03.290
it's smoked salmon.
[chuckles]

29:03.325 --> 29:04.675
[growls]

29:04.710 --> 29:07.294
everybody, dinner's ready.

29:07.329 --> 29:08.962
Okay, there's that.

29:08.998 --> 29:11.248
Pasta.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.951
I made blackened salmon.
- It's my favorite, by the way.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.486
- The pasta looks great.

29:15.521 --> 29:16.920
- It's olive oil...

29:16.956 --> 29:19.156
- Olive oil?
- Garlic, basil, lemon zest.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.091
- Oh, perfect.
- Are you sitting by me?

29:21.126 --> 29:23.460
I'm right there.
- All right.

29:23.479 --> 29:25.696
Bon appétit, everyone.
- Bon appétit.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.297
Thank you for cooking, kyle.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.833
- Any complaints, let me know.
I'm open to criticism.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.168
- No, there's no criticism.

29:31.203 --> 29:32.503
- No one's gonna criticize.

29:32.538 --> 29:33.987
<i> - It's not blackened.</i>

29:34.023 --> 29:36.490
This is...

29:36.525 --> 29:37.491
Burnt fish.

29:37.526 --> 29:40.327
- It's really good.
- Doogie knows her stuff.

29:40.362 --> 29:41.779
- [laughs]

29:41.814 --> 29:43.881
- doogie, without you,
what would we do?

29:43.916 --> 29:46.817
[laughter]

29:46.852 --> 29:49.837
- I have no idea why my sisters
call me "doogie."

29:49.872 --> 29:53.990
<i> when I was born, kathy and kim</i>
<i> just called me that.</i>

29:54.009 --> 29:56.009
Now that I think about it,
it's a little suspicious.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.845
[laughs]

29:57.880 --> 30:00.864
- she's a good cook.
Doogie's a good cook.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.233
'cause she's like
a little doogie.

30:05.554 --> 30:08.188
- A doogie. Little child.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.107
<i> It's a love name.</i>

30:10.142 --> 30:14.812
Like a little tootsie roll.
[laughs]

30:14.847 --> 30:16.313
- so you two
are ten years apart?

30:16.348 --> 30:17.447
Yes?
- 9 1/2.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.950
- 9 1/2, okay.
- That's a big chunk.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.219
- And she never annoyed me.
- Never?

30:22.254 --> 30:24.872
- Kim would come in
and love to torture me.

30:24.907 --> 30:28.492
We get along really well.
But she would love to...

30:28.527 --> 30:30.394
- Torture you, yeah.
- Torture me.

30:30.429 --> 30:33.197
- Well, that's kim.
- That's amazing.

30:33.232 --> 30:34.431
- You know?
- [laughs] right?

30:34.466 --> 30:36.867
I could say that maybe
kim tortured me too.

30:36.886 --> 30:39.102
I don't know.
- I brought the bunny.

30:39.138 --> 30:42.239
So what I should do
is give it to you.

30:43.259 --> 30:45.759
You don't have to cry over it.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.512
- I'm gonna walk away
for just a second,

30:48.547 --> 30:50.480
'cause this just doesn't feel
quite right.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.182
What do you think?

30:52.217 --> 30:53.817
- Sutton,
did you bring presents?

30:53.853 --> 30:56.186
- She always brings a present.
- You're so generous.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.021
- Garcelle, do you want
to play santa?

30:58.056 --> 30:59.489
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, y'all,

30:59.525 --> 31:02.276
because of covid, this is
a really important thing

31:02.328 --> 31:03.360
for us all to have.

31:03.395 --> 31:06.079
- Erika, lisa.
- Thank you!

31:06.115 --> 31:07.297
- You're welcome.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.082
- And I think especially

31:09.118 --> 31:11.418
going into our election week
next week,

31:11.453 --> 31:13.587
it might be
even more important to have.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.072
All: Ooh.

31:15.107 --> 31:18.141
- Ooh!
- [laughs]

31:18.177 --> 31:21.445
- oh!
- Oh, I love it!

31:21.480 --> 31:22.813
- I love it!

31:22.848 --> 31:24.548
- We all need a flask.
- Whoo!

31:24.583 --> 31:27.050
- You guys,
it's our initials on it.

31:27.086 --> 31:30.053
- Um, I've never used
a flask, no.

31:31.974 --> 31:34.358
- If we pull this out of
a beautiful bag, is it wrong?

31:34.393 --> 31:36.393
- As two chicks from the south?

31:36.428 --> 31:37.628
No.
- We're like, no.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.162
- Now what do we put in this?

31:39.198 --> 31:40.964
- Whatever you want, girl.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.934

39:34.406 --> 39:35.271
You wanted to punish me...

39:35.290 --> 39:37.307
- Absolutely.
- And make me feel bad!

39:37.342 --> 39:39.542
- But I've always been the type
that I don't get angry enough.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.294
This is something I had
to work on all my life.

39:41.329 --> 39:42.379
- Great.
- I was taught,

39:42.414 --> 39:43.413
"be nice, be nice, be nice,"

39:43.448 --> 39:47.217
to a fault that I had to learn
to say how I feel.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.386
- Good.

39:49.421 --> 39:52.422
- There's a really big stigma
with black women

39:52.457 --> 39:55.792
that we're seen
as angry or aggressive.

39:55.811 --> 39:59.295
And sometimes, those labels
make you want

39:59.331 --> 40:00.397
to hold back a little bit,

40:00.432 --> 40:03.349
because you don't want
to fall into the stereotype

40:03.402 --> 40:04.834
<i> that was given to us.</i>

40:04.870 --> 40:06.469
<i> We haven't claimed it.</i>

40:06.505 --> 40:08.405
But people have
labeled us that.

40:08.440 --> 40:12.242
I just want you to know that
it's going to take some time.

40:12.277 --> 40:14.160
- And I'm okay with that.
- So we're there.

40:14.196 --> 40:15.745
- Okay.
This is so good, though!

40:15.781 --> 40:17.363
Because you just were honest!

40:17.416 --> 40:18.581
- Really?

40:18.617 --> 40:21.751
- Last year,
denise really didn't want

40:21.787 --> 40:24.454
to deal with a lot of issues,

40:24.489 --> 40:25.839
<i> and she ran.</i>

40:25.874 --> 40:28.675
<i> Garcelle is coming to me</i>
<i> to say how she feels.</i>

40:28.710 --> 40:30.627
That is all I ask.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.796
Like, that's great
that you did that.

40:32.831 --> 40:36.349
<i> Don't run. Don't hide.</i>
<i> Don't send cease and desists.</i>

40:36.384 --> 40:38.501
Deal with it in the moment.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.853
I'm gonna be me.

40:39.888 --> 40:42.188
And if that's great, it's good.

40:42.224 --> 40:44.340
If it's not good,
you'll tell me.

40:44.376 --> 40:45.642
- Okay.
- We'll have a good time

40:45.677 --> 40:47.644
with everybody,
and this group and whatnot,

40:47.679 --> 40:49.646
but you do
what feels safe for you.

40:49.681 --> 40:50.647
- Will do.
- Okay?

40:50.682 --> 40:53.783
- Yeah.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.869
- I have gotten
to know garcelle.

40:55.904 --> 40:58.538
And I do think,
if you're talking to her

40:58.573 --> 41:02.492
in a really real way,
she's gonna accept it.

41:02.527 --> 41:03.743
But if you try to be fake

41:03.795 --> 41:06.496
or call her out...

41:06.531 --> 41:07.864
You cannot do that.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.415
- Hold on, sutton.
- It came from all

41:09.468 --> 41:10.800
the many bombs.
- Hold on, sutton.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.252
You're not being honest

41:12.304 --> 41:13.470
by not acknowledging
the stuff before,

41:13.505 --> 41:15.889
because I did nothing
until that moment.

41:15.924 --> 41:17.307
- What was your bomb?

41:17.342 --> 41:19.309
- I had a charity event.

41:19.344 --> 41:20.844
She'd raised her hand
to make a donation,

41:20.879 --> 41:23.179
and then--she did end up
paying the donation.

41:23.214 --> 41:24.214
She has now.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.599
But I brought up the fact
that she raised her hand

41:26.651 --> 41:28.902
and didn't follow through
and pay the donation.

41:30.555 --> 41:31.654
- I know, but see, that's--

41:31.690 --> 41:32.922
- but it's been handled
since then.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.741
- Do you regret doing it?
Or no?

41:34.776 --> 41:36.693
- Hmm, interesting question.

41:36.728 --> 41:40.630
- I didn't until I sat down
with her and we spoke.

41:40.665 --> 41:43.900
And she said to me that
it really, like, hit her deeply

41:43.919 --> 41:47.287
because there's, like,
a stigma with, you know--

41:47.339 --> 41:49.305
she said, with black people
and not paying their bills.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.341
- Mm-hmm.
- I would never know the things

41:51.376 --> 41:52.792
that she was referring to.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.378
- I understood what garcelle
meant in that moment.

41:55.413 --> 41:57.430
But I don't think that's where
you were coming from.

41:57.465 --> 41:58.681
- Obviously, you know me.
- At all.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.300
- I would never mean
something like that.

42:00.352 --> 42:01.918
- 100%.
- Okay--

42:01.937 --> 42:03.686

maybe reconciled.
