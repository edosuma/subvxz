WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.610
Previously onSupergirl...

00:02.654 --> 00:05.135
My fiancee died fighting
on the front lines.

00:05.179 --> 00:07.050
I saw Alex almost die.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.312
Give me the medallion.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.663
Can you translate
these markings?

00:11.707 --> 00:14.492
I got something
from Rip Roar. A name.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.103
Leviathan.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.669
I can use Supergirl
to achieve my ends.

00:17.713 --> 00:20.498
That is easier to do if she believes there is trust.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.631
Malefic's back
in the Phantom Zone.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.024
You like it here, don't you?

00:24.067 --> 00:25.634
I like it very much.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.641
You're off your game today,
Supergirl.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.040
I could say the same to you.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.263
Not so fast.

00:47.743 --> 00:48.787
I need to be ready.

00:56.839 --> 00:59.102
We don't know when
Leviathan will strike next.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.235
We don't even know
what it is.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.627
And what are they after?

01:02.671 --> 01:05.065
All these unknowns
make me feel anxious.

01:05.108 --> 01:07.719
And when I feel anxious,
I want to punch things.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.604
We've faced
unknown dangers before.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.867
This feels different.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.390
I have a bad feeling about it.

01:26.434 --> 01:29.176
Well, Alex has the DEO
working overtime
on Leviathan.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.178
Are you sure something else
isn't bothering you?

01:32.875 --> 01:34.572
Before I told Lena
I was Supergirl,

01:34.616 --> 01:36.748
I was terrified
how she would react.

01:36.792 --> 01:39.360
I was so afraid
I was going to
ruin the friendship.

01:40.665 --> 01:43.320
Ugh.  I still hate
thinking about it.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.105
Watching William
lose his friend

01:45.148 --> 01:46.715
hit a little too close to home.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.373
J'onn? J'onn?

01:58.292 --> 01:59.554
You can come out now.

02:02.383 --> 02:03.688
Give me the medallion.

02:06.778 --> 02:07.649
I don't think so.

02:10.651 --> 02:13.698
I have the most intricate
security system in the world.

02:13.742 --> 02:14.917
I know all about Leviathan.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.354
No one knows
all about Leviathan.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.877
Leviathan is unknowable.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.052
I'm not afraid.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.228
You will be.

02:29.279 --> 02:30.541
She's gone.

02:30.585 --> 02:33.631
I've reactivated
heightened penthouse security.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.591
You were right
as always, Ms. Luthor.

02:36.634 --> 02:40.638
Leviathan will attempt
to retrieve the medallion
at all costs.

02:40.682 --> 02:43.119
But why would you provoke them
over something of no value?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.990
It has value to me.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.601
The medallion was
special to my mother,

02:46.644 --> 02:49.212
and the fact that Leviathan
wants it makes it useful.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.475
Lex theorized that Superman
kept every weapon

02:51.519 --> 02:55.566
that was ever used against him
in a special facility,
a fortress.

02:55.610 --> 02:58.352
And although he never found it,
I think Lex was right.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.659
I think the perfect
dispersal device

03:01.703 --> 03:04.053
for Project Non Nocere
is hidden there,

03:04.096 --> 03:05.446
gathering dust.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.231
And Leviathan is
gonna help me find it.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.712
Please don't underestimate
the danger of Leviathan.

03:10.755 --> 03:13.280
You should cancel
the L-Corp event at the park.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.629
They will come after you.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.760
Let them come.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.677
Supergirl will save me.

03:28.512 --> 03:29.948
Tell us exactly
what happened.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.341
I already told you, I'm fine.

03:31.385 --> 03:33.038
Alex, you should be
tracking Leviathan.

03:33.082 --> 03:35.345
Yes, and Rip Roar,
but Brainy's on that,

03:35.389 --> 03:37.260
so just stop deflecting.

03:39.044 --> 03:42.309
Before I fell, I was seized
by another vision of Malefic.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.267
"Another"? You've had
more of these?

03:44.311 --> 03:47.357
Yesterday. I felt Malefic
during the psychic attack.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.099
It's as if I can sense him
all around me.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.449
But how? We sent him
to the Phantom Zone.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.451
All I can think is
these flashes are...

03:55.409 --> 03:57.715
maybe symptoms of my guilt.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.936
I know we had no choice
but to send Malefic back
to the Phantom Zone, but...

04:00.979 --> 04:03.939
I mean, he's too dangerous
to be contained here on Earth.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.332
Even so, I can't help feeling

04:05.375 --> 04:06.811
I've wronged my brother again.

04:07.464 --> 04:08.770
This is the third time

04:08.813 --> 04:10.380
he's been sentenced
to confinement by my hand.

04:10.424 --> 04:13.035
No, your brother
made his own decisions.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.080
You can't blame yourself
for that.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.909
But it seems like you're going
through some sort of trauma.

04:17.952 --> 04:19.259
Maybe Kelly can help.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.261
She can't provide
the help I need.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.871
I'll deal with this
the Martian way.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.772
Where's the medallion?

04:55.730 --> 04:56.774
I...

04:58.123 --> 04:59.342
I couldn't retrieve it.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.824
It was a simple task.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.087
It would have been simple
with any other human, but...

05:05.827 --> 05:07.481
she is a Luthor.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.918
Do you know how long that
I've been safeguarding
this planet?

05:10.440 --> 05:11.659
Since the beginning.

05:11.702 --> 05:14.792
And since our ship,
as big as an asteroid,

05:14.836 --> 05:17.055
wiped out the dinosaurs.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.623
Then humanity rose...

05:19.667 --> 05:21.886
and became a scourge
to this planet,

05:21.930 --> 05:23.975
and for eons we have kept

05:24.019 --> 05:26.369
their destructive behavior
at bay, but now...

05:26.413 --> 05:28.458
They're ravaging the Earth
like never before,

05:28.502 --> 05:31.722
and I granted you the privilege

05:31.766 --> 05:34.856
of serving our cause,
and you failed.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.814
Is it her failure,
Rama Khan?

05:38.381 --> 05:40.035
Or is it yours?

05:40.078 --> 05:41.384
You can go, Margot.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.177
Using a carrot
instead of a stick

05:52.221 --> 05:53.875
is not what we need right now.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.753
Well, they are known as
the "snowflake generation."

06:02.797 --> 06:04.451
So what does that mean,
they melt?

06:05.452 --> 06:06.670
Never mind.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.197
You and I both share
the same goal...

06:12.241 --> 06:15.418
of wanting to put a stop
to people who disrespect
this planet.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.377
I'm here to offer my help.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.465
How can you help?

06:18.508 --> 06:20.249
The world is shifting,
evolving.

06:20.292 --> 06:21.555
Moving faster than it ever has.

06:21.598 --> 06:24.079
We have to remain
ahead of the curve.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.820
The old ways aren't working--

06:25.863 --> 06:28.562
Oh, the rising of oceans
and the raging of rivers
will always work.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.434
Give the brute force
a rest, Rama Khan.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.872
Let's try my technology.

06:34.916 --> 06:38.441
Our elder left the caretaking
of this planet to me...

06:39.268 --> 06:40.443
for a reason.

06:43.794 --> 06:46.188
You want something done,
you have to do it yourself.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.500
Thank you all
for coming on
such a wonderful day.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.155
What was that?

06:57.199 --> 06:59.027
Running these trails
has always been my favorite way
to clear my mind.

07:00.550 --> 07:01.856
- What was that?
- Did you feel that?

07:01.899 --> 07:04.293
It means
so much to me

07:04.336 --> 07:06.861
that L-Corp can have a hand
in preserving these grounds.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.788
You have something
that belongs to me.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.936
-What was that?

07:38.980 --> 07:39.850
Leviathan.

08:01.350 --> 08:04.788
Thank God for selfie culture.

08:04.832 --> 08:08.705
Because of this generation's
constant need to
livestream everything,

08:08.749 --> 08:10.664
we've got a clear image
of your attacker.

08:10.707 --> 08:13.318
And I knew I had seen
that face before.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.538
Do you recall Antioch,
526 AD?

08:15.582 --> 08:17.192
It was an earthquake.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.499
It was the eighth-largest
natural disaster
in modern history.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.588
Precisely. It's good
to have you back, Lena.

08:21.631 --> 08:24.112
A myth was born that
this man was the cause.

08:24.155 --> 08:28.116
Now, of course, scientists
insisted that the natural
disasters were natural,

08:28.159 --> 08:32.337
but, in an ironic twist
of history, they were wrong...

08:32.381 --> 08:34.383
and the fearmongers were right.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.993
Several reliable sources place

08:36.037 --> 08:37.995
this man at
the scene of the crime
throughout history.

08:38.039 --> 08:41.912
Pompeii, the Yellow River flood
of 1887, the Bhola Cyclone,

08:41.956 --> 08:44.349
even as far back as
Noah's flood,

08:44.393 --> 08:45.916
this Earth-Bender
has been spotted.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.353
Excuse me, did you say
"Earth-Bender"?

08:48.397 --> 08:49.572
How else would you
describe him?

08:49.616 --> 08:51.269
He... He literally
manipulates the earth.

08:51.313 --> 08:53.794
Wait, Pompeii? Noah's flood?

08:53.837 --> 08:56.057
I mean, what is he,
thousands of years old?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.538
Correct. Which means
that he is an alien

08:58.581 --> 09:01.889
with powers of longevity
this civilization
has never conceived of.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.587
No wonder people
thought he was a myth.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.938
With all this destruction,
his existence is still
shrouded in mystery.

09:07.982 --> 09:11.115
He's managed
to convince the world
he doesn't exist.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.726
It seems so.

09:12.769 --> 09:16.294
The word "Leviathan"
occurs six times
in the Hebrew Bible.

09:16.338 --> 09:19.515
Never once does it appear
in any historical
scientific literature.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.040
So how are we supposed to
fight a highly secretive,
thousand-year-old alien

09:23.084 --> 09:25.173
with powers that we have
no idea how to beat?

09:25.216 --> 09:27.392
Well, I know
one person who spent
his life fighting aliens,

09:27.436 --> 09:29.307
-both real and imagined.
-Your brother.

09:29.351 --> 09:32.049
I know most of
his minor weapons
are in Fort Summit,

09:32.093 --> 09:35.618
but his truly horrendous ones,
they were all destroyed
by Superman.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.141
That's not necessarily true.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.753
A lot of Lex's weapons are
in the Fortress of Solitude.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.845
Oh, it's... It's a place
Superman created.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.586
We keep things there
that can harm us.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.326
Well, you just go
to the Fortress,

09:48.370 --> 09:50.198
and I'll give you a list
of every weapon
that Lex ever created.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.767
Why don't you come with me?

09:53.810 --> 09:55.812
I mean, there's no telling
what weapons we'll encounter.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.685
And then, Brainy and I
will stay here, and we'll
continue our search

09:58.728 --> 10:01.644
for Rip Roar
and this Earth-Bender.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.908
Supergirl, remember
the strongest, most potent
weapon is knowledge.

10:04.952 --> 10:07.650
So send me
whatever you can find
from the Fortress database.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.913
You ready for a road trip?

10:12.002 --> 10:13.917
Are you sure me going
is a good idea?

10:13.961 --> 10:15.353
Of course. Why wouldn't it be?

10:15.397 --> 10:17.529
I don't know. A Luthor
in the Fortress of Solitude?

10:17.573 --> 10:20.141
It's gonna
be great. But you're
gonna need a jacket.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.624
Father,

10:24.667 --> 10:28.410
I haven't been this lost
since after I killed
Manchester Black.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.325
You came to me then.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.328
You helped me find myself.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.027
I need your help now.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.255
J'onn, my son!

10:48.952 --> 10:51.346
Father.
It's good to see you.

10:55.437 --> 10:58.396
I am... I am so sorry.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.661
I know now what I did.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.794
It was unforgivable.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.101
When I wiped your mind
of Malefic...

11:07.971 --> 11:10.191
I committed the greatest sin.

11:10.234 --> 11:11.932
No, J'onn.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.804
It was I who failed.

11:14.848 --> 11:18.547
All you did was ease
your father's suffering.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.853
I forced your hand.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.769
I take full responsibility.

11:25.206 --> 11:28.818
But that's not the reason
I'm here, is it?

11:30.690 --> 11:31.691
Uh, no.

11:33.301 --> 11:34.868
Father, I need your counsel.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.958
Malefic came after my family,

11:38.001 --> 11:41.004
and history repeated itself.

11:41.048 --> 11:44.268
To protect them,
I had to send Mal back
to the Phantom Zone.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.662
I have tried to move on,

11:46.706 --> 11:48.969
but it's like
I can feel him nearby.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.058
That's because he is nearby.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.931
-What?
-Your brother is here.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.890
You mean here in my mind?

11:57.891 --> 11:58.848
No.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.155
I mean, he's across town.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.203
Anything?

12:06.247 --> 12:09.206
I went back to the scene
of Lena's attack and collected
samples of the soil.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.253
I am also scanning
for the Earth-Bender's
seismic wave signature.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.342
Nothing so far.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.127
Earth-Bender?

12:18.607 --> 12:21.088
It's Rip Roar. We found him.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.876
He's not moving.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.095
Did they take him out?

12:28.486 --> 12:29.357
Why?

12:32.490 --> 12:33.491
Fall back.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.725
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

12:49.769 --> 12:50.944
I am intact.

12:52.075 --> 12:54.904
You're the fragile human.
Are you harmed?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.297
I don't think so...

12:56.819 --> 12:58.908
but I am furious.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.257
They dangled Rip Roar,

13:00.301 --> 13:02.607
knowing that we would
take the bait, and now...

13:02.651 --> 13:03.826
we've got nothing.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.046
Not nothing.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.787
We still have Rip Roar's armor.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.572
We should start
studying it immediately.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.748
-Oh...
-Alex.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.837
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.318
Oh, but you have a nasty cut.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.422
There. Perfect as always.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.165
Director Danvers!

13:45.563 --> 13:48.436
Wow! This is... breathtaking.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.003
It's our Krypton on Earth.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.671
Intruder! Intruder!

14:06.715 --> 14:07.934
What's happening?

14:07.977 --> 14:08.978
Luthor DNA detected.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.414
L-Protocol engage.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.503
"L-Protocol"? No.
No, no, no, no, no!

14:12.547 --> 14:14.505
Luthor, relinquish your Kryptonite ring

14:14.549 --> 14:16.420
and your transmatter
portal watch immediately.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.988
I don't have a ring
or a watch.
I'm not Lex!

14:19.032 --> 14:21.034
Hand over
the weapons at once,

14:21.077 --> 14:24.211
or the Fortress will
take offensive action
in ten seconds.

14:24.254 --> 14:25.473
She's unarmed.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.910
-Ten, nine, eight...
-I'll fix this.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.870
-...seven, six, five...
-Come on, come on.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.176
...four, three, two...

14:34.743 --> 14:36.310
L-Protocol terminated.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.530
Sorry. I had no idea

14:39.574 --> 14:42.577
Superman would take
such extreme measures.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.274
No, if Lex knew
about this place,

14:44.318 --> 14:47.756
he would do anything
or kill anyone
to get in here, so...

14:47.799 --> 14:49.366
Well,
you are not Lex.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.542
And you are not your cousin.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.241
We're miles beyond those boys

14:54.284 --> 14:55.677
with their sticks
and their stones.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.548
Yes, we are.

14:57.592 --> 15:01.552
Malefic is in National City,
and he needs your help.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.206
My help!

15:03.250 --> 15:05.252
If what you say is true,
then everyone I love
is in danger.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.645
Your brother cannot harm them.

15:07.689 --> 15:08.908
He is a prisoner.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.083
A prisoner?

15:11.127 --> 15:12.259
Of whom?

15:12.302 --> 15:14.391
That you must discover
on your own.

15:15.218 --> 15:19.092
Father, you have to help me.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.094
How can I find him?

15:21.137 --> 15:22.660
You must make a choice.

15:24.184 --> 15:27.100
Banish your brother
once and for all...

15:28.536 --> 15:30.407
or save his soul.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.889
However, there is only one way

15:33.933 --> 15:35.282
to reach Malefic.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.285
And it requires you to...

15:39.286 --> 15:42.071
risk your own death
by his hand.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.077
Kelly.

15:48.686 --> 15:49.818
What're you doing here?

15:49.861 --> 15:51.037
Brainy texted Nia that

15:51.080 --> 15:53.126
you were both involved
in an explosion.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.302
So I rushed over.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.434
Really, you have...
You have nothing...

15:57.478 --> 16:00.568
You have nothing
to worry about.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.964
No, no. No, don't do that.
 Don't cry.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.226
Because if you cry,
then I'm gonna cry,

16:06.269 --> 16:08.097
and you know I really hate
crying at work.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.493
You should have called.

16:12.536 --> 16:13.668
I should have, I'm sorry.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.977
And next time, I will.
I promise.

16:22.677 --> 16:23.678
Okay.

16:23.721 --> 16:25.158
Wait.
What're you doing?

16:26.942 --> 16:28.639
I have to go back to work.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.032
You were nearly just blown up,

16:30.076 --> 16:33.035
and you have a mild concussion.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.516
You can't go back out there
until you're 100 percent.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.346
Okay.

16:42.914 --> 16:45.004
We're almost to
the central database.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.093
Assuming the Fortress
doesn't attack me again.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.008
Thank you for saving me
back there.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.226
I shouldn't have had to,

16:50.270 --> 16:51.923
but it does seem like
dangerous saves

16:51.967 --> 16:53.534
are sort of our thing now.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.144
Yeah, it does.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.712
Of course, it used to be me

16:57.755 --> 16:59.496
being the one
that's saving you.

16:59.540 --> 17:03.196
Imagine, I thought I was
protecting my fragile,
vulnerable friend.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.459
I'm so sorry.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.503
Remember when we went
to Kaznia and the jet
was crashing?

17:07.548 --> 17:09.463
And I was frantic
to try and save us,

17:09.506 --> 17:12.248
desperate to save my friend
before myself...

17:12.291 --> 17:14.685
Little did I know that
that friend could actually fly.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.166
I'm so sorry
I put you through that.

17:18.211 --> 17:19.516
No, it was impressive

17:19.560 --> 17:21.866
how often you saved me
without me realizing...

17:21.910 --> 17:24.042
I mean, you're
an excellent actress.

17:24.086 --> 17:27.002
Telling you the truth
was such a relief,

17:27.046 --> 17:28.482
and I'm so glad that now

17:28.525 --> 17:29.961
we can be honest
with each other

17:30.005 --> 17:31.659
and all of that is behind us.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.705
Me too.

17:34.749 --> 17:35.750
It's this way.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.235
Are you happy now?

17:42.278 --> 17:44.454
No. I've searched the globe.
I can't find them.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.719
With all your power,
you were defeated,

17:48.763 --> 17:51.505
you still don't have
the medallion,
and you lost them?

17:51.548 --> 17:52.723
I will fix this.

17:58.164 --> 18:01.689
Rama Khan,
we're on the same side.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.387
Let me help you.

18:04.431 --> 18:07.129
Your power has kept things
in alignment for ages,

18:07.173 --> 18:09.088
but the world has changed.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.351
Humans are connected
by vast networks,

18:11.394 --> 18:14.615
information flows
across the globe
at the speed of light.

18:15.442 --> 18:18.358
My technology is
a tool we need.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.926
The way to reach them
is beyond you.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.232
They are beyond me.

18:24.364 --> 18:28.716
But if I can't
feel the presence

18:29.630 --> 18:31.936
of Supergirl
or the Luthor girl on Earth,

18:31.980 --> 18:33.329
then that means...

18:36.376 --> 18:38.378
they're in
the one place on Earth...

18:40.119 --> 18:41.598
that is not of Earth.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.955
Is that a polyphasic
quantum processor?

18:50.999 --> 18:52.131
They've long been theorized,

18:52.174 --> 18:54.133
but I had no idea
one actually existed.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.351
I think it is.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.093
My name is Kara Zor-El.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.444
I seek information on
ancient Earth-bending aliens.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.359
The only alien matching
that description

19:03.403 --> 19:06.275
comes from a sister planet
of Krypton, Jarhanpur.

19:06.319 --> 19:09.191
The planet was destroyed
after years of civil wars,

19:09.235 --> 19:10.975
but five of its leaders fled.

19:11.019 --> 19:13.456
One of those leaders
has the extraordinary power

19:13.500 --> 19:15.241
to bend the earth to his will.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.112
How do we stop him?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.331
There are weapons
in the Fortress armory

19:18.374 --> 19:19.767
that can wound him.

19:19.810 --> 19:21.812
Weapons thought to
weaken Kryptonians.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.858
Those created by Lex Luthor,

19:23.901 --> 19:25.164
brother of Lena Luthor.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.643
Thank you, that's all we need.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.255
Well, we better get
to the armory.

19:29.298 --> 19:30.343
If there are more
of these aliens,

19:30.386 --> 19:32.214
we're gonna need
a really big gun.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.000
We should warn Brainy.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.307
-Yeah.
-Do you mind if I do it?

19:38.351 --> 19:40.831
I've never interfaced with
a quantum processor before.

19:40.875 --> 19:41.876
It'd be a bit of a thrill.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.530
Knock yourself out.

19:51.712 --> 19:52.582
Done.

19:53.844 --> 19:54.715
Let's go.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.419
The only chance
of saving your brother...

20:04.464 --> 20:08.816
is to let down
your psychic shield entirely.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.777
Open your mind to him
like a flower.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.389
Complete vulnerability.

20:16.432 --> 20:18.869
Allow him access
to your memories

20:18.913 --> 20:22.264
and innermost thoughts,
so he can see your truth.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.223
If I bond with Malefic...

20:25.746 --> 20:28.009
he can choose
to poison my mind.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.274
How can I make that choice
knowing that he will

20:32.318 --> 20:34.407
most likely murder me...

20:35.538 --> 20:38.715
and kill everyone I love?

20:38.759 --> 20:42.241
Then retrieve
the Phantom Zone projector,

20:42.284 --> 20:44.243
send him back to isolation.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.722
And punish him again?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.290
I'm sorry, my son.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.730
In my lifetime,
I faced this test.

20:54.688 --> 20:58.126
Should I attempt
to reach Malefic

20:58.169 --> 21:01.260
and risk the utter decimation

21:01.303 --> 21:03.479
of my people, my family,
and myself

21:03.523 --> 21:06.047
by his destructive power?

21:08.179 --> 21:10.530
Or should I lock him away

21:10.573 --> 21:12.445
where he cannot harm others?

21:15.491 --> 21:19.626
I made my impossible choice.

21:19.669 --> 21:22.498
There is no such thing
as right or wrong.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.326
There is only peace
in one's heart,

21:24.370 --> 21:27.329
something I never found.

21:29.636 --> 21:33.030
The sins of the father
are visited on the son.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.774
You must make
your own choice, J'onn.

21:37.818 --> 21:41.082
Then ask H'ronmeer
to guide you to your brother.

21:43.084 --> 21:45.042
No matter what you decide,

21:46.348 --> 21:48.002
I will love you for it.

21:50.178 --> 21:53.660
Just as I loved both you
and Malefic...

21:55.226 --> 21:56.532
long ago.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.026
This gun is so tiny.

22:12.069 --> 22:15.464
Yeah, Lex designed that
to fit under
his many human hair wigs.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.727
-Ugh!
-So, yeah.

22:17.771 --> 22:20.208
Right, so the computer said
we need to look for something

22:20.251 --> 22:22.341
that will hurt Kryptonians.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.820
Seems to be a lot
of that in here.

22:25.431 --> 22:26.519
What's this?

22:28.216 --> 22:29.696
That is Myriad.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.742
My... My family created it.

22:32.786 --> 22:35.571
I think I was still
in Metropolis
when Myriad hit.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.399
The news footage, though,
it was pretty horrific.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.836
And reality was even worse.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.883
My Aunt Astra and her husband
turned all of humanity

22:42.926 --> 22:46.016
into mindless zombies
in less than a second.

22:46.060 --> 22:49.542
If there is one weapon
in this room I could destroy,
it would be that one.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.111
Oh, well, this could be
the ticket.

22:55.199 --> 22:56.853
It's a sonic cannon.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.508
It sends concentrated
blasts of high-frequency
ultrasonic waves

22:59.552 --> 23:00.727
at whatever you aim it at.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.032
With a few slight adjustments,

23:02.076 --> 23:04.034
we can maybe use it
to destabilize Rama Khan.

23:04.078 --> 23:07.908
I mean, at least long enough
to put the power-dampening
cuffs on him.

23:07.951 --> 23:10.867
It was designed for evil,
but perhaps we can use it
for some good.

23:20.355 --> 23:23.097
...evidence that the
Psions affected the Czarnians'
evolutionary process.

23:23.140 --> 23:24.620
It's obvious.

23:24.664 --> 23:26.187
Hydrogen molecules synonymous
with Thanagarian atoms...

23:26.230 --> 23:30.104
Good God, it...
 It's just...
It's clear!

23:32.889 --> 23:33.847
My inhibitor.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.197
Of course.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.504
I'm less inhibited.

23:38.547 --> 23:42.072
It's spectacular,

23:42.116 --> 23:43.813
truly and absolutely.

23:51.908 --> 23:52.909
Great Scott!

23:56.696 --> 23:59.525
Of course! Tuesday,
croissant... Pilates...
meaning...

24:00.569 --> 24:02.919
Leviathan headquarters
are in National City.

24:06.967 --> 24:10.753
You know, I know I said that
I really wanted
to get back to work,

24:10.797 --> 24:13.669
but this is so much better.

24:13.930 --> 24:14.975
Oh.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.674
Look, I really...

24:18.718 --> 24:21.938
appreciate being taken care of.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.724
I'm so used to doing
all this by myself.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.509
But being with you, it...

24:29.293 --> 24:30.556
It feels like home.

24:33.559 --> 24:34.647
What's wrong?

24:35.996 --> 24:38.825
When Nia texted me
that you were hurt...

24:40.043 --> 24:42.263
my stomach dropped...

24:42.306 --> 24:45.658
and I checked my phone
for a text, and
there was nothing there,

24:45.701 --> 24:47.964
so I assumed the worst.

24:49.705 --> 24:52.186
Because I've been
through the worst,

24:52.229 --> 24:55.145
and this isn't the first time
that I've been terrified.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.844
Last week, I thought
that I was gonna lose you.

24:58.627 --> 24:59.976
But then you got me
that helmet,

25:00.020 --> 25:02.762
and you were so wonderful
and so excited.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.635
And so I pushed past my fears,

25:06.679 --> 25:10.509
and I convinced myself
that I can handle it all.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.730
But I'm not that strong.

25:14.774 --> 25:16.732
And I would never
ask you to change

25:16.776 --> 25:19.474
or ask you to
deny the amazing

25:19.518 --> 25:21.737
and brave woman that you are.

25:21.781 --> 25:24.697
Kelly, what--
What are you saying?

25:25.698 --> 25:27.177
I can't.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.179
Leviathan.

25:30.354 --> 25:32.792
I... I think
I have their location.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.011
We must leave immediately.

25:38.145 --> 25:40.582
Go.  Please, go.

26:01.429 --> 26:02.822
This is it?

26:02.865 --> 26:04.563
Choosing an unobtrusive
structure is how Leviathan

26:04.606 --> 26:05.999
keeps their base a secret.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.088
Except from me.

26:10.177 --> 26:13.876
I must tell you that
in the wake of the explosion,

26:13.920 --> 26:18.620
it is as if
the peripheral vision
of my mind has expanded.

26:18.664 --> 26:22.711
I can now see 20/20
out of the corner of
each metaphorical eye.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.887
Which is how I saw,
when examining
Rip Roar's tech,

26:24.931 --> 26:26.802
some peculiar markings
on his headpiece.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.717
When joined together, it formed
a symbol that can be seen

26:28.761 --> 26:30.327
countless times
throughout history.

26:30.371 --> 26:33.287
A symbol that has been seen
at disasters and catastrophes,

26:33.330 --> 26:34.767
events of mass destruction.

26:34.810 --> 26:37.073
A symbol that has connected
Rama Khan and Leviathan,

26:37.117 --> 26:40.076
but also... every Tuesday
before Pilates,

26:40.120 --> 26:41.512
I get a morning tea
and croissant

26:41.556 --> 26:43.689
at a delightful patisserie
right past this building.

26:43.732 --> 26:46.256
Okay, let's just hope
that you are right.

26:46.300 --> 26:49.608
I mean, look. This is
a fact-finding mission,

26:49.651 --> 26:53.002
so please just... be cool.

26:53.046 --> 26:53.960
I am cool.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.788
You see, I chose
this coffee shop

26:55.831 --> 26:57.833
because of its close proximity
to National City's
ancient tar pits,

26:57.877 --> 26:59.661
a site of great importance
in history, but also

26:59.705 --> 27:00.836
a site of terrible eruption.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.925
You see, despite
its sulfuric scent,

27:02.969 --> 27:05.493
its emitted energy
boosts my brain function.

27:05.536 --> 27:08.627
And I believe Leviathan
has picked this building
for the very same reason.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.106
The ancient energy.

27:10.672 --> 27:11.760
Behold...

27:13.457 --> 27:16.156
The same symbol appears
on this building's cornerstone.

27:16.199 --> 27:17.070
It's impressive.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.116
Not just impressive.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.645
Very impressive.

27:35.392 --> 27:36.872
Cloaking tech.

27:36.916 --> 27:38.569
In order to eliminate
this barrier,

27:38.613 --> 27:40.223
we'll have to hit it
with something similar
to the creator...

27:40.267 --> 27:41.616
something ancient.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.487
I've got it. The dust
from the majestic tar pits

27:43.531 --> 27:45.489
emits Veridian radiation,

27:45.533 --> 27:47.709
redistributing power, and...

27:50.190 --> 27:51.365
No, no, no.
Don't push it yet!

27:57.937 --> 28:00.417
If this elevator leads to
where you think it's going,

28:00.461 --> 28:01.767
we're gonna need Supergirl.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.988
Supergirl, we've located
Leviathan.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.295
Great. Send us the coordinates
and we'll come to you.

28:08.338 --> 28:10.297
Okay,
and I'll have the DEO
start a broadband scan ASAP.

28:12.734 --> 28:13.996
Time to go.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.304
Is that...

28:17.957 --> 28:19.306
It is.

28:19.349 --> 28:20.786
Stay here. Get the gun ready.

28:36.062 --> 28:38.673
You thought
you could hide her from me?

28:38.717 --> 28:42.285
I am ancient. I am the earth.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.417
What are you?

28:49.728 --> 28:52.948
Me? I'm just peeved
you didn't knock.

28:59.607 --> 29:02.523
I don't understand.
Every piece of evidence
led here.

29:02.566 --> 29:05.352
At least we know
my security measures
are working.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.272
Let's get out of here.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.942
I told you, I am the earth!

29:37.645 --> 29:41.214
"The earth."
But the Fortress
isn't made of earth.

29:44.826 --> 29:47.220
I'm curious,
how did you find us?

29:47.263 --> 29:49.613
When I searched
the globe and couldn't
find you,

29:49.657 --> 29:52.094
I went to the one place that
I knew that you could hide.

29:52.138 --> 29:53.966
I think
you overlooked something.

29:54.923 --> 29:56.490
Oh?

29:56.533 --> 29:58.361
You're in my house.

29:58.405 --> 29:59.972
I have home court advantage.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.853
Welcome to Krypton, old man.

30:25.736 --> 30:26.999
Forget about me?

30:33.092 --> 30:35.616
You won't survive me again,
Kryptonian.

30:45.104 --> 30:46.105
Lena?

30:47.367 --> 30:48.324
Lena?

30:51.327 --> 30:52.198
Lena.

30:57.725 --> 30:58.987
Why do you have Myriad?

31:04.514 --> 31:05.602
Well, you caught me.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.216
I have Myriad
because I'm using you...

31:11.565 --> 31:12.914
like you used me.

31:17.049 --> 31:19.355
I never used you.

31:19.399 --> 31:22.010
Do you remember
when you finally told me
you were Supergirl?

31:24.404 --> 31:25.492
You were weeping.

31:26.493 --> 31:28.234
Big crocodile tears.

31:30.149 --> 31:32.194
Well, I wept real tears,

31:32.238 --> 31:34.762
bitter tears over you
weeks before.

31:34.805 --> 31:37.896
What? I... I thought...

31:42.030 --> 31:43.379
How long had you known?

31:44.467 --> 31:46.948
I found out the day
I killed my brother.

31:46.992 --> 31:50.038
Lena, you didn't kill Lex,
that was me.

31:50.082 --> 31:52.606
I... I watched him...

31:53.781 --> 31:54.956
I saw him fall.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.653
You saw him fall,
but did you see him land?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.091
Did you see him die?

32:01.310 --> 32:03.399
I did, and let me tell you,
it wasn't pretty.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.184
That's impossible.

32:05.227 --> 32:06.707
Anything's possible
when you're a Luthor.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.668
Lex used
his transmatter portal watch.

32:12.669 --> 32:14.323
I knew exactly where he'd go.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.021
To the cabin we loved
when we were children,

32:16.064 --> 32:17.848
so I was there waiting for him.

32:17.892 --> 32:20.199
I had the gun ready... loaded.

32:20.242 --> 32:22.114
I could feel the weight of it
in my hands.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.988
Every fiber in my being
rebelled, but I--

32:27.032 --> 32:28.424
I didn't want to do it,
but I knew I had to

32:28.468 --> 32:31.645
because if Lex lived,
the world wouldn't be safe,

32:31.688 --> 32:33.038
my friends wouldn't be safe.

32:33.081 --> 32:35.605
So I forced myself
to pull the trigger.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.088
I shot my own brother
in the chest.

32:42.134 --> 32:44.527
His final words to me were...

32:44.571 --> 32:46.790
that I was a fool,

32:46.834 --> 32:51.839
that my best friend,
that every friend I had
was lying to me.

32:51.882 --> 32:55.495
With his dying breath,
he told me that
you were Supergirl.

32:57.236 --> 32:58.324
Lena, you have to believe me,

32:58.367 --> 33:00.239
I never meant to humiliate you.

33:00.282 --> 33:03.285
No. When I came to this city,

33:03.329 --> 33:06.332
I promised myself that
I would never trust
anyone again, and...

33:08.160 --> 33:10.510
then I met you.

33:10.553 --> 33:13.817
You chipped away at my armor
with your warmth
and your earnestness,

33:13.861 --> 33:17.386
and you convinced me to trust
in people and friendship again,

33:17.430 --> 33:20.650
and against my better judgment,
I did,

33:20.694 --> 33:23.479
all the while telling you
about my Achilles heel...

33:25.351 --> 33:26.439
betrayal.

33:28.397 --> 33:29.790
I confided in you

33:29.833 --> 33:32.358
that everyone in my past
had betrayed me.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.188
About how much it hurt...

33:36.971 --> 33:38.842
to have someone you love

33:38.886 --> 33:40.366
lie to you and betray you.

33:40.409 --> 33:44.326
I spelled it out
to you over and over again,

33:44.370 --> 33:47.068
essentially begging you
not to violate my trust,

33:47.112 --> 33:50.028
begging you not to prove that,
once again, I was a fool.

33:51.159 --> 33:53.074
You reassured me ad nauseam

33:53.118 --> 33:54.554
that you would never lie to me,

33:54.597 --> 33:56.512
that you'd never hurt me.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.907
And all the while,
there wasn't a single

33:59.950 --> 34:01.300
honest moment
in our friendship--

34:01.343 --> 34:03.041
No! No, that is not true--

34:03.084 --> 34:05.565
No! I killed my brother
for you, for our friends!

34:05.608 --> 34:07.741
Don't you understand
what you've done?

34:14.878 --> 34:19.187
When you found out,
why didn't you come...
to me right away,

34:19.231 --> 34:20.710
so I could explain--

34:20.754 --> 34:22.408
"Explain"? Yeah?

34:23.974 --> 34:25.976
If you hate me so much, why...

34:26.020 --> 34:28.109
Why not out me
at the Pulitzer party?

34:31.112 --> 34:33.331
Why pretend to still be
my friend this long?

34:33.375 --> 34:36.335
Because I wanted you
to experience
what you did to me.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.426
Feel what I felt.

34:47.215 --> 34:50.827
I understand your pain
and your fury and...

34:52.090 --> 34:53.264
And you're right.

34:53.308 --> 34:55.179
I made a big mistake,

34:55.223 --> 34:58.574
maybe the biggest mistake
of my life, but please...

34:58.618 --> 35:01.099
Lena, please don't leave
the Fortress with Myriad.

35:01.142 --> 35:04.189
Please don't let my mistake
push you to do
something terrible.

35:04.232 --> 35:06.756
-You are a good person.
-No!

35:06.800 --> 35:10.325
No, you don't ever get
to tell me who
or what I am again.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.284
Intruder! Intruder!

35:16.897 --> 35:20.422
Did you reprogram
the Fortress defenses
to attack me?

35:20.640 --> 35:21.554
Yes.

35:24.209 --> 35:27.299
And I rigged it to answer
to this little button
I have in my hand.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.607
Are you going to try
to kill me?

35:31.651 --> 35:35.698
No. Supergirl,
I'm not gonna kill you.

35:40.660 --> 35:41.661
I'm not a villain.

35:45.186 --> 35:46.622
You shouldn't have
treated me like one.

36:00.723 --> 36:03.335
And now you've come
to finish what you started?

36:05.119 --> 36:06.251
I have.

36:24.225 --> 36:25.792
But I will not...

36:25.835 --> 36:28.838
send you back
to the Phantom Zone, brother.

36:28.882 --> 36:31.667
I spent lifetimes there,
brother.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.758
Lifetimes of nothing.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.675
No air, no time,

36:39.719 --> 36:41.199
no sight, no smell.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.202
Nothing but my heart...

36:45.290 --> 36:47.248
suspended mid-beat.

36:49.555 --> 36:53.298
An excruciating suspense
that never stops.

36:55.387 --> 36:57.780
A breath you can never exhale.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.265
Is that where you suggest
I send you?

37:04.309 --> 37:05.745
You can if you wish.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.968
But I bring this only now
as an offering...

37:14.014 --> 37:15.668
to show you

37:15.711 --> 37:18.627
that I mean it when I say
that I have come here...

37:20.150 --> 37:21.413
to make amends.

37:23.589 --> 37:24.590
Liar!

37:26.200 --> 37:28.028
Mal,

37:28.071 --> 37:31.858
I wish I could've
broken you out of that cave
when we were children.

37:33.381 --> 37:34.948
Found some way to...

37:36.123 --> 37:37.255
show you.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.562
you were my brother
and I loved you!

37:42.999 --> 37:44.871
You didn't love me.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.743
You were ashamed of me.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.616
You hid me away.

37:51.834 --> 37:52.966
Banished me...

37:53.836 --> 37:55.055
like a monster!

37:57.536 --> 37:58.885
We were afraid of you.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.062
We were all afraid of you.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.675
I was afraid of you.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.636
And we were so wrong.

38:13.029 --> 38:15.423
I destroyed my honor...

38:15.467 --> 38:17.643
when I wiped you
from our memories.

38:19.471 --> 38:22.212
But, Mal, what I did,
I did for love.

38:22.256 --> 38:23.910
Now that I remember...

38:25.694 --> 38:28.044
I cannot live with this pain.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.656
And so, brother...

38:32.919 --> 38:34.573
I beg your forgiveness

38:36.357 --> 38:37.924
by submitting myself...

38:39.055 --> 38:40.318
to the bond.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.453
Look into my mind, brother.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.368
It's that easy?

38:49.283 --> 38:51.546
You hand yourself over to me.

38:55.376 --> 38:58.858
I will look...
with pleasure, brother.

39:00.903 --> 39:02.818
Right before I kill you.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.734
I'm willing
to risk everything...

39:07.083 --> 39:09.651
in order for you
to see my truth,

39:09.695 --> 39:13.568
my heart, my soul, and my mind.

39:38.419 --> 39:39.725
I saw.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.093
-Hey.
-Hi.

40:01.747 --> 40:03.879
-I was--
-No, it's... I know.

40:05.794 --> 40:06.795
Um...

40:09.276 --> 40:11.104
You have been through

40:11.147 --> 40:13.106
an unbearable experience.

40:13.933 --> 40:15.021
Yeah.

40:15.064 --> 40:17.850
You lost your fiancee,
and I can't even

40:17.893 --> 40:21.462
begin to imagine losing
someone that you love...

40:22.332 --> 40:23.595
in that way.

40:26.162 --> 40:28.904
You're just so strong

40:28.948 --> 40:31.994
that I didn't...
I didn't realize
that you were still suffering,

40:32.038 --> 40:35.433
and I'm really sorry that
I wasn't more sensitive
to that.

40:35.476 --> 40:37.217
-No, don't--
-Just... Just...

40:37.260 --> 40:38.436
Listen...

40:41.526 --> 40:42.875
When you met me,

40:43.615 --> 40:45.181
I was just half a person.

40:46.531 --> 40:49.229
I was still hurting
from my own wounds

40:49.272 --> 40:52.798
and you... You helped me heal.

40:52.841 --> 40:55.714
You know, from wounds to scars,

40:56.192 --> 40:57.498
to just memories.

40:59.979 --> 41:02.764
That's... That's all I want
to do for you.

41:04.418 --> 41:07.552
Hey, I want to help you heal.

41:07.595 --> 41:09.554
I want to be with you

41:09.597 --> 41:12.339
and face down your fears
and do it together.

41:12.382 --> 41:15.168
I want to help you heal.

41:16.212 --> 41:18.084
And what if that's
not possible?

41:20.347 --> 41:21.696
Well, I know that it is.

41:22.784 --> 41:23.655
How?

41:24.351 --> 41:25.831
Because you healed me.

41:27.833 --> 41:30.923
I meant it when I said
that you feel like home.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.535
You feel like home, too.
