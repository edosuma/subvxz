00:01.012 --> 00:02.402
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.427 --> 00:03.504
The Beast...

00:03.529 --> 00:05.413
The Beast of Gevaudan.

00:05.448 --> 00:07.215
The Beast was a man first.

00:07.250 --> 00:09.551
A human killer in the late 1700s.

00:09.653 --> 00:15.355
Marie-Jeanne faced the Beast armed
with nothing more than a steel-tipped pike.

00:15.391 --> 00:18.292
All of history will remember my name.

00:18.327 --> 00:19.709
No one will remember.

00:19.734 --> 00:21.595
They erased every detail of him.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.297
Damnatio Memoriae.

00:23.332 --> 00:25.700
The Dread Doctors are
trying to get it to remember itself.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.902
It's still bound to its host,
the teenage Chimera inside.

00:28.937 --> 00:30.170
Discover its identity,

00:30.206 --> 00:32.046
then your friends would
have a fighting chance.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.174
But I got its scent.

00:35.764 --> 00:36.997
It's you.

00:38.347 --> 00:39.379
Wait!

01:24.075 --> 01:24.974
What are we doing here?

01:25.009 --> 01:26.643
It was the only place I could think of.

01:26.678 --> 01:27.843
Wait... What do you mean?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.313
Scott can't find you down here.
He can't follow your scent.

01:30.348 --> 01:32.248
Okay, hold on.

01:32.733 --> 01:34.227
It's not me.

01:34.252 --> 01:36.018
I'm not even a Genetic Chimera.

01:36.053 --> 01:37.186
You sure about that?

01:38.656 --> 01:40.289
It was on the bus.

01:40.324 --> 01:42.858
After I made us disappear,
I felt something.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.194
I don't know how to describe
it, but it felt wrong.

01:45.229 --> 01:46.862
Completely and totally wrong.

01:48.732 --> 01:50.498
And, trust me,

01:50.523 --> 01:54.024
every other second I'm with you
is completely and totally right.

01:55.339 --> 01:57.706
It can't be me.

01:57.741 --> 02:01.376
After we left the bus, I lost
you at the game. Remember?

02:02.088 --> 02:03.287
Where did you go?

02:03.312 --> 02:04.811
I went to...

02:05.854 --> 02:07.248
I was...

02:07.284 --> 02:09.417
All those times you
said the Beast showed up?

02:09.452 --> 02:11.523
Everything you said about frequencies.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.493
Where were you all those times?

02:13.518 --> 02:15.518
The night at the transmission towers...

02:18.028 --> 02:20.195
The observatory downtown...

02:21.531 --> 02:23.364
The army base...

02:23.399 --> 02:25.366
All the times you said
there were transmissions...

02:32.908 --> 02:33.908
Wait.

02:36.633 --> 02:38.066
They can still find me.

02:39.257 --> 02:40.556
They can find me by frequency.

02:40.581 --> 02:42.280
- Who? Scott?
- No...

02:44.220 --> 02:45.252
Them.

03:12.613 --> 03:14.247
Run!

04:00.296 --> 04:02.126
Mason.

04:07.667 --> 04:08.733
Come on!

04:10.570 --> 04:11.836
Mason...

04:24.917 --> 04:26.483
Come on. Come on!

04:39.531 --> 04:40.964
Mason...

04:43.200 --> 04:45.267
Mason! Come on!

06:02.578 --> 06:04.345
You want me to put it on?

06:05.581 --> 06:06.680
Yeah.

06:06.716 --> 06:08.682
You won't die if you put it on.

06:08.718 --> 06:10.885
How do you know that?

06:10.920 --> 06:13.154
Or is it just that you don't
want to put it on yourself?

06:14.590 --> 06:15.856
Or you?

06:15.891 --> 06:17.324
I'm not afraid to do it, Josh.

06:19.328 --> 06:20.861
I'm just not stupid.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.065
Are you not getting that it could kill us?

06:25.100 --> 06:27.468
You're the one with the power.

06:27.503 --> 06:29.470
They want you to wear it, Josh,

06:29.505 --> 06:33.473
because the properties of the mask
are based in electro-magnetism.

06:33.508 --> 06:35.508
Pick it up and you'll see.

06:53.261 --> 06:55.060
What is this thing?

06:55.096 --> 06:57.897
Product of genius and madness.

06:59.267 --> 07:02.034
Two traits too often
found in the same mind.

07:03.104 --> 07:05.771
The man who created the first

07:05.806 --> 07:07.973
was known only as "The Surgeon."

07:10.444 --> 07:13.478
Using practices in the farthest
edges of pseudo-science,

07:15.783 --> 07:18.951
he harnessed electromagnetic
fields in the masks...

07:20.521 --> 07:24.456
infusing them with a
unique and deadly power.

07:47.614 --> 07:49.659
I'm not putting this thing on.

07:51.351 --> 07:53.951
You want to know who it is? Do it yourself.

08:13.264 --> 08:14.317
Lydia!

08:14.342 --> 08:15.505
I just came from his place.

08:15.540 --> 08:17.341
Half of his stuff was gone.

08:17.376 --> 08:18.442
You can't let him leave.

08:18.477 --> 08:20.010
It's okay. I got a call from Dispatch.

08:20.045 --> 08:21.211
He's headed for the highway.

08:21.246 --> 08:22.412
Can you stop him?

08:22.448 --> 08:25.148
Stopping him is one thing.
Getting him to turn around...

08:25.184 --> 08:26.449
Leave that to me.

08:52.141 --> 08:54.743
I don't remember giving
you any vacation time.

08:55.646 --> 08:57.880
- Those were new tires.
- Well...

08:57.915 --> 08:59.515
Well, they're scrap rubber, now.

09:00.784 --> 09:02.918
How about I call a tow for you?

09:02.953 --> 09:05.153
I'll call one myself.

09:08.526 --> 09:10.425
You're both out of your
minds. You know that?

09:10.460 --> 09:12.093
- You can't leave.
- I can't stay.

09:12.129 --> 09:14.095
I'm a Hellhound.

09:14.131 --> 09:17.365
I have the word, "Hell" in my name. Hell.

09:17.401 --> 09:19.034
You're also one of my best deputies.

09:19.069 --> 09:20.135
You guys don't get it.

09:20.170 --> 09:22.970
The bodies I see in my
dream are because of me.

09:23.006 --> 09:24.572
And there's gonna be more.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.074
A lot more.

09:26.109 --> 09:28.043
I've been predicting death longer than you.

09:28.078 --> 09:29.444
The things I've seen and felt...

09:29.479 --> 09:30.578
They don't always happen.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.915
What if those people die
because you didn't stay?

09:33.950 --> 09:35.851
Because you weren't there to protect them.

09:38.254 --> 09:40.287
You said you were drawn to Beacon Hills.

09:41.658 --> 09:43.591
I think you're here for a reason.

09:44.794 --> 09:45.860
Hey.

09:56.772 --> 09:58.438
We gotta find them.

09:58.474 --> 09:59.453
It's Mason.

09:59.478 --> 10:01.341
I know. Everybody's looking.

10:06.281 --> 10:08.448
- What?
- Nothing.

10:08.473 --> 10:09.632
It's just a scholarship.

10:10.585 --> 10:11.651
I missed the due date.

10:13.789 --> 10:15.055
We'll figure it out.

10:15.090 --> 10:18.058
Right now, you're not going
anywhere until you heal. Okay?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.011
What?

10:40.081 --> 10:41.339
What? What did I do?

10:41.364 --> 10:42.529
Tell him.

10:43.605 --> 10:45.951
You know how my mother wants to kill me?

10:45.987 --> 10:47.412
I think she might want to kill you too.

10:47.436 --> 10:50.022
Okay, uh, that's disconcerting.

10:50.992 --> 10:52.152
I should probably have a gun.

10:55.529 --> 10:56.845
I'm not giving you a gun.

10:56.870 --> 10:58.730
You have a gun.

10:58.765 --> 11:01.833
The Desert Wolf who is
trying to kill me, has a gun.

11:01.868 --> 11:03.535
I think I should probably have a gun.

11:19.686 --> 11:21.819
I probably shouldn't have a gun.

11:24.724 --> 11:25.990
Mason?

11:26.860 --> 11:28.259
Mason!

11:33.932 --> 11:34.998
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:35.734 --> 11:37.401
I lost it.

11:38.204 --> 11:39.537
I lost the scent.

11:39.572 --> 11:40.904
I'll help you find it.

12:11.603 --> 12:13.403
My dad's got an APB out...

12:13.438 --> 12:15.170
For a 5'8" 16-year-old?

12:15.206 --> 12:18.140
I recommended nine-foot
tall rampaging werewolf.

12:18.175 --> 12:19.975
It still might not be him.

12:24.916 --> 12:27.316
But, Hayden's at the school looking.

12:27.351 --> 12:28.584
I can keep checking the woods.

12:28.619 --> 12:31.020
My mom can check all
the hospitals in the county.

12:31.756 --> 12:32.756
We can find him.

12:33.824 --> 12:35.090
What happens then?

12:35.125 --> 12:36.625
We figure out a way to save him.

12:37.928 --> 12:40.596
Okay. Where else could we look?

12:41.665 --> 12:42.698
Let's ask Corey.

12:46.002 --> 12:47.603
Wait. Wait. It's not my fault.

12:47.638 --> 12:49.148
They took him and I couldn't do anything.

12:49.172 --> 12:50.571
- They took him...
- Who?

12:52.209 --> 12:53.808
The Dread Doctors.

13:07.490 --> 13:09.590
Wait! Don't... Wait, please. Please, don't!

13:09.626 --> 13:10.626
No, no, no!

13:11.494 --> 13:12.494
No, no, no!

13:31.509 --> 13:32.742
What about this?

13:33.845 --> 13:35.878
They're useless if we don't know who it is.

13:35.914 --> 13:37.723
Actually, they're just useless.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.715
Didn't Hayden mention that?

13:39.751 --> 13:42.217
Where is she, by the way?

13:42.253 --> 13:45.487
I hope her moment of dissent
didn't turn into actual desertion.

13:50.194 --> 13:52.727
What about the other one? Corey?

13:53.931 --> 13:56.231
None of us can see him, blind or otherwise.

13:56.267 --> 13:57.866
So, I'm guessing, he's not here either.

13:57.901 --> 13:59.768
I'm leaving.

13:59.803 --> 14:02.170
Oh, there goes another.

14:02.205 --> 14:05.907
Your circle of trust is narrowing for you.

14:05.943 --> 14:08.057
Your voice is getting on my nerves.

14:09.145 --> 14:10.278
Paralyze his tongue.

14:10.313 --> 14:11.580
You got it.

14:12.716 --> 14:15.216
Tell me something, Tracy.

14:15.251 --> 14:17.751
Just how powerless were you
before this all happened?

14:22.058 --> 14:24.592
In my experience, it's the truly powerless

14:24.627 --> 14:29.564
who are all too eager to
demonstrate their new-found strength.

14:29.599 --> 14:33.533
So allow me to demonstrate
something more helpful to our cause.

14:35.179 --> 14:36.545
Trust...

14:49.851 --> 14:53.386
I told you I wanted Scott McCall's eyes.

14:55.090 --> 14:56.923
That's why I let you take me.

15:08.837 --> 15:11.904
Though I have been a willing
guest this entire time.

15:17.545 --> 15:20.279
As your father, I'm obliged
to warn you this is dangerous.

15:20.314 --> 15:22.881
As my father, I was hoping
you wouldn't tell my mother.

15:23.984 --> 15:25.917
That's dangerous, too.

15:25.953 --> 15:28.587
I get it, Dad. I need to learn balance.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.023
Can't learn balance with the sword,

15:30.057 --> 15:30.956
the sword brings out the Fox.

15:30.991 --> 15:33.459
You know it's more complicated than that.

15:33.494 --> 15:35.961
Learning balance is critical
to controlling the Fox.

15:35.996 --> 15:37.941
What if the sword is
critical to saving my friends?

15:37.965 --> 15:39.597
It's just a weapon, Kira.

15:39.633 --> 15:40.966
You're the critical part.

15:41.001 --> 15:42.934
I've got 800 years to find balance.

15:42.970 --> 15:44.970
We need to help Mason right now.

15:46.006 --> 15:47.006
I need my sword.

15:51.478 --> 15:53.344
It was forged with a unique power.

15:53.380 --> 15:55.880
It takes a certain power
to put it back together.

15:55.915 --> 15:57.848
- You're going to need help.
- From who?

15:57.884 --> 15:59.284
- Whom.
- Who?

16:00.987 --> 16:02.620
Just pick up the pieces.

16:18.104 --> 16:19.104
Okay.

16:23.009 --> 16:24.675
What now?

16:24.711 --> 16:27.444
I teach you what you've
been so desperate to learn.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.052
Feel that, Theo?

16:37.055 --> 16:40.857
That's the secret to taking power. Pain.

16:42.428 --> 16:44.027
Take their pain,

16:44.796 --> 16:46.029
take their life,

16:46.765 --> 16:47.864
take their power.

16:49.801 --> 16:50.801
It's all or nothing.

16:53.538 --> 16:56.339
You take until there's
nothing more to give.

16:58.944 --> 17:00.976
That's where you find the spark of power.

17:02.079 --> 17:04.380
And then, you take that as well.

17:04.415 --> 17:08.351
Pain. Life. Power. In that
order and only that order.

17:08.386 --> 17:09.551
Do you understand?

17:11.256 --> 17:12.521
Perfectly.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.285
I can feel it.

17:44.154 --> 17:46.154
Good.

17:46.189 --> 17:47.789
'Cause you just cost yourself one member

17:47.824 --> 17:51.025
of a small and inexperienced pack.

17:59.803 --> 18:01.102
What do you think?

18:03.339 --> 18:06.139
I think he was small and inexperienced.

18:07.376 --> 18:09.276
And if you've got his power now,

18:10.313 --> 18:12.112
you can put on the mask.

18:45.313 --> 18:46.979
You can still save them.

18:55.256 --> 18:56.621
You can save them all.

19:11.905 --> 19:15.039
This kind of
power requires risk, Theo.

19:15.075 --> 19:16.575
Do it.

19:16.610 --> 19:18.744
Put on the mask.

19:18.779 --> 19:24.015
Discover the Beast's identity and
guarantee your place as an Alpha.

19:24.885 --> 19:26.985
As a real werewolf.

19:46.439 --> 19:47.671
No! No!

20:01.761 --> 20:04.428
How stupid are we
to be doing this?

20:04.463 --> 20:06.329
We're not stupid. We're desperate.

20:06.354 --> 20:07.553
How desperate?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.267
Incredibly desperate.

20:18.677 --> 20:21.310
I told you we'd
end up on the same side.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.658
How about I punch you in the
balls to remind you we're not?

20:23.682 --> 20:25.715
I love this kid.

20:26.251 --> 20:28.150
I don't.

20:28.186 --> 20:30.119
We know you're
not on our side, Theo.

20:30.154 --> 20:32.822
You said you wanted to help Lydia,

20:32.858 --> 20:34.469
but you left Eichen with
something else, didn't you?

20:34.493 --> 20:35.558
You mean the mask?

20:37.295 --> 20:38.339
Are you worried about that?

20:38.363 --> 20:39.363
Did you put it on?

20:42.934 --> 20:43.934
Who did you see?

20:43.968 --> 20:46.802
Not Mason. What's that mean? It's not him?

20:46.837 --> 20:48.971
It probably means he's a lost cause.

20:49.007 --> 20:50.306
We all want the same thing.

20:52.176 --> 20:53.409
We want Mason back.

20:53.444 --> 20:56.344
Okay, but the difference is
that we want him back alive.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.146
Well, I'm open to compromise.

20:59.683 --> 21:01.884
You still got the map with
telluric currents on it?

21:04.622 --> 21:06.488
Bring it to the operating
theater in two hours.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.492
How desperate are we?

21:12.329 --> 21:13.628
Incredibly.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.174
We don't need them to find Mason.

21:27.209 --> 21:29.677
But you'll need them if
you want Mason to trust you.

21:30.713 --> 21:32.680
I can't take the power from him, can I?

21:32.715 --> 21:35.450
No, only the Beast.

21:35.485 --> 21:38.853
But since the full moon is
getting dangerously close,

21:38.888 --> 21:41.489
the opportunity might present
itself sooner than you think.

21:41.524 --> 21:42.556
Good.

21:42.591 --> 21:45.359
As soon as you see that
opportunity, take it.

21:45.394 --> 21:48.495
If Scott figures out a way to
save Mason, you won't get another.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.998
But we've seen that thing up close.

21:51.033 --> 21:53.367
How are we supposed to stop
him when he's the Beast?

21:53.402 --> 21:54.634
You're not going to stop him.

21:55.537 --> 21:57.371
You're going to paralyze him.

21:57.406 --> 22:00.239
Me? Are you serious? It
didn't work on Parrish.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.576
It didn't work on a Hellhound.

22:02.611 --> 22:04.544
The Beast is still a werewolf.

22:04.580 --> 22:07.313
Just keep the tanks full, Tracy.

22:07.349 --> 22:08.782
We'll need all you've got.

22:12.554 --> 22:14.320
Still nothing from Scott and Liam.

22:15.256 --> 22:17.090
Are we really sure this is a good idea?

22:17.125 --> 22:19.258
Uh, no. No one thinks this is a good idea.

22:19.294 --> 22:20.893
But you're trusting Theo, anyway?

22:20.928 --> 22:22.862
We're not trusting him. We're using him.

22:22.897 --> 22:24.330
What if he's using us?

22:24.366 --> 22:25.798
That's probably a given.

22:25.833 --> 22:28.245
But, look, we're just trying to
cover every place Mason could show up.

22:28.269 --> 22:29.613
Malia and Braeden are at Scott's house.

22:29.637 --> 22:31.204
Melissa's got the hospital.

22:31.239 --> 22:32.549
Hayden and Corey are at the school.

22:32.573 --> 22:34.840
Somebody's got to find him.

22:34.876 --> 22:37.376
Let's hope they find
Mason, and not the Beast.

22:39.647 --> 22:42.280
They called him Der Soldat.

22:42.316 --> 22:44.884
That's German for "The Soldier."

22:44.919 --> 22:47.085
I'm pretty sure he fought in World War II.

22:49.256 --> 22:50.889
And he was a Nazi.

22:50.924 --> 22:52.724
And an Alpha werewolf.

22:54.428 --> 22:56.106
The Dread Doctors were using
him to prolong their lives.

22:56.130 --> 22:57.862
They've been doing it for decades.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.297
Actually, probably longer.

22:59.333 --> 23:00.698
How old are these guys?

23:00.734 --> 23:03.368
Who knows. But wherever
they go, he goes, too.

23:03.404 --> 23:04.702
So how do we find him?

23:04.738 --> 23:08.773
Keeping him alive requires a
pretty unique set of conditions.

23:08.808 --> 23:10.441
There's got to be a power source.

23:10.476 --> 23:11.709
It has to be underground...

23:11.745 --> 23:13.244
And on a telluric current.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.223
Looks like we're going for a hike.

23:28.361 --> 23:29.493
We got a hit and run.

23:29.529 --> 23:33.097
Victim is a black male,
approximately 16 years of age.

23:33.132 --> 23:35.066
Blood pressure is 80 and dropping.

23:39.304 --> 23:41.171
Nothing here.

23:41.206 --> 23:43.139
- Same here.
- Anything on your end?

23:43.175 --> 23:45.241
Not a thing. And I'm gonna lose my mind

23:45.277 --> 23:47.243
if I don't get out of
this supernatural cage.

23:47.279 --> 23:49.045
The Mountain Ash
is there to keep you safe.

23:50.615 --> 23:52.515
I should be keeping Stiles safe.

23:53.685 --> 23:54.685
He'll be fine.

23:56.121 --> 23:58.454
Call me if anything changes.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.525
I'll pass. Thanks.

25:16.799 --> 25:18.498
Where is he?

25:18.534 --> 25:19.899
I thought we were looking for him.

25:19.934 --> 25:22.669
You know who I'm talking about.

25:22.704 --> 25:24.704
- Deucalion?
- You shouldn't trust him.

25:24.739 --> 25:26.473
And you're the one who let him live.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.376
I'm not a murderer.

25:29.411 --> 25:32.445
You still think you're gonna get
through all this without killing anyone?

25:32.481 --> 25:34.247
I didn't say that.

25:37.819 --> 25:39.285
We're close.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.519
You get his scent?

25:43.624 --> 25:44.624
Which way?

25:50.298 --> 25:52.098
You think you're going to leave me behind?

25:53.634 --> 25:55.601
Liam...

25:55.636 --> 25:58.537
- Look, he wants to kill him.
- I just want his power.

25:58.573 --> 26:01.907
You want to fight someone that actually
wants to kill Mason? Go fight Parrish.

26:01.942 --> 26:03.487
Who did you see when you put on the mask?

26:03.511 --> 26:05.043
I already told you. It wasn't Mason.

26:05.079 --> 26:06.079
Who was it?

26:07.582 --> 26:09.447
I saw a man dying in the snow.

26:10.450 --> 26:11.490
He was impaled on a spear.

26:12.586 --> 26:14.619
It's called a pike.
Lydia told us the story.

26:14.654 --> 26:17.455
Then both of you know what it means.

26:17.490 --> 26:20.058
Time's running out.

26:20.094 --> 26:22.260
Where is he, Liam? What direction?

26:30.002 --> 26:31.068
This way.

26:44.717 --> 26:45.916
Listen.

26:49.956 --> 26:50.956
It's him.

26:59.465 --> 27:01.009
Mason?

27:22.156 --> 27:23.588
It's connected to him.

27:33.694 --> 27:34.724
Hey, it's me.

27:34.748 --> 27:38.650
Oh, God. I wish you just picked
up. I hate leaving messages.

27:38.685 --> 27:40.329
I always ramble. I
always say stupid things.

27:40.353 --> 27:41.631
And then when I finally get
to the super important thing

27:41.655 --> 27:44.223
that I'm supposed to say, the
voice-mail cuts me off and...

27:53.366 --> 27:54.866
Me again.

27:56.035 --> 27:57.368
I have to leave.

27:57.403 --> 28:00.237
But I'm coming back to help. I promise.

28:00.273 --> 28:01.538
Because you're right, Scott.

28:01.574 --> 28:04.752
If anyone is going to save Mason, it's you.

28:05.067 --> 28:06.300
It's us.

28:23.728 --> 28:25.428
What is this thing?

28:26.231 --> 28:27.330
I don't know.

28:28.433 --> 28:31.334
Liam, I can feel it.

28:32.570 --> 28:33.803
It's in my skull.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.307
Don't move.

28:37.942 --> 28:38.942
Careful.

28:38.976 --> 28:41.544
- What are they doing to him?
- I don't know.

28:41.579 --> 28:43.245
Guys, let's focus.

28:43.281 --> 28:45.681
Mason, we're gonna get you out of here.

28:49.453 --> 28:50.485
Hold him still.

28:52.456 --> 28:53.923
Okay. All right.

28:53.958 --> 28:55.766
I'm going to try to pull it out.

28:57.795 --> 28:58.894
Let me know if it hurts...

29:03.867 --> 29:05.734
It hurts!

29:06.870 --> 29:07.969
It definitely hurts.

29:09.326 --> 29:10.939
I barely moved it.

29:30.927 --> 29:33.594
Hmm? What? What
happened? Who's dead?

29:35.164 --> 29:36.797
No one.

29:36.833 --> 29:39.002
Well, at least not yet.

29:52.304 --> 29:53.304
You okay?

29:53.837 --> 29:56.237
Yeah, I'm still thinking.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.352
Still trying to figure out why Mason?

29:59.989 --> 30:02.122
I mean, he wasn't even on
the Genetic Chimera list.

30:02.157 --> 30:03.157
He is now.

30:04.826 --> 30:07.786
Mason was born with twin
embolization syndrome.

30:07.811 --> 30:09.328
You mean fetal resorption?

30:10.344 --> 30:11.798
He had a vanishing twin in utero?

30:11.833 --> 30:14.333
Which accounts for two sets of DNA.

30:14.369 --> 30:17.336
Can someone please say it with words
that have less than three syllables?

30:17.372 --> 30:18.905
He ate his twin.

30:18.940 --> 30:19.972
Oh, God.

30:20.308 --> 30:21.608
But did it help?

30:21.843 --> 30:23.232
I don't know.

30:23.257 --> 30:25.566
But it's just bizarre enough to sound
like it might be important, right?

30:25.590 --> 30:27.780
It has to help. There has to be something.

30:34.321 --> 30:35.853
They wanted us here.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.420
Liam, try to get that
thing out of Mason's neck.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.034
Theo...

30:50.069 --> 30:51.869
Theo Raeken.

30:51.905 --> 30:52.870
He's coming with us.

30:52.906 --> 30:56.574
Failure... Theo Raeken.

30:58.010 --> 30:59.209
I'm not a failure.

31:00.914 --> 31:05.316
Liam... Get out of here. Just go.

31:05.351 --> 31:08.852
Not a complete failure.

31:08.887 --> 31:11.888
We learned from you.

31:11.924 --> 31:14.058
Theo, he's trying to get to you.

31:14.093 --> 31:15.893
This is what they want,
don't give it to them.

31:15.928 --> 31:17.694
We can't beat them.

31:17.729 --> 31:20.129
The mark of a true failure.

31:20.165 --> 31:24.033
Repeating the same mistake again and again.

31:26.772 --> 31:28.204
We're taking Mason.

31:31.910 --> 31:33.510
Then I'm taking what's mine.

31:41.356 --> 31:43.433
Braeden, something's wrong.
We gotta go...

32:09.532 --> 32:12.199
- Mason...
- Mason Hewitt.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.668
He's a sophomore. Liam's best friend.

32:14.703 --> 32:17.604
And a mass murderer.

32:17.639 --> 32:19.050
We're going to need to tell Scott the rest.

32:19.074 --> 32:21.007
Not necessarily.

32:21.043 --> 32:22.219
If there's a way to save him...

32:22.243 --> 32:24.010
The pike won't save him. It'll kill him.

32:25.414 --> 32:27.181
Mason Hewitt is gone.

32:28.684 --> 32:31.551
But you still can't tell me where it is.

32:31.587 --> 32:33.820
How do we know it's not
a steel cup gathering dust

32:33.855 --> 32:35.688
in someone's antique collection?

32:35.723 --> 32:39.024
Oh, I think it's closer to us than that.

32:39.060 --> 32:40.797
We'll find the pike.

32:41.262 --> 32:42.995
Whatever shape it's in.

32:43.030 --> 32:44.475
If we can't, then we're going to need

32:44.499 --> 32:46.877
a lot more firepower to take on the Beast.

32:49.604 --> 32:51.537
How much firepower do you want?

32:54.008 --> 32:55.874
Let him go.

32:55.910 --> 33:01.647
You have the entitlement and
narcissism typical of your generation.

33:01.682 --> 33:04.549
In that, you are a profound success.

33:10.890 --> 33:12.657
- God!
- Scott!

33:12.692 --> 33:15.061
Scott, I... I can't get it
out. I don't know what to do.

33:19.766 --> 33:22.267
But your failure
taught us one thing.

33:22.302 --> 33:24.503
The banality of evil.

33:24.538 --> 33:28.640
That you were and would
always be an ordinary evil.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.175
You think I'm ordinary?

33:31.210 --> 33:34.378
We believed that to
resurrect the perfect killer

33:34.413 --> 33:37.749
we had to start with the perfect evil.

33:37.784 --> 33:41.718
From you we learned true
evil only comes by corrupting

33:41.754 --> 33:43.687
something truly good.

33:45.269 --> 33:46.369
Not something.

33:49.995 --> 33:51.362
Someone.

34:04.032 --> 34:05.250
Liam, wait!

34:13.585 --> 34:14.917
Liam!

34:15.820 --> 34:17.554
Liam!

35:03.123 --> 35:05.057
Transformation...

35:07.815 --> 35:10.649
Transformation without frequency.

35:11.075 --> 35:12.075
Mason!

35:15.902 --> 35:18.836
That is not my name.

37:16.017 --> 37:17.417
Still here Braeden?

37:24.426 --> 37:25.958
Okay.

37:27.094 --> 37:28.594
I love a cage match.

37:44.711 --> 37:46.644
I know you can hear me.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.582
I need your help.

37:54.355 --> 37:56.288
Maybe I failed your test.

37:59.492 --> 38:01.558
Maybe I don't have control yet.

38:04.530 --> 38:06.397
But I'll do whatever I have to.

38:07.367 --> 38:08.799
Whatever it takes.

38:09.235 --> 38:10.501
Please.

38:12.305 --> 38:14.338
Tell me how to save my friends.

38:29.354 --> 38:31.154
Kira...

38:34.593 --> 38:36.312
We can help her.

38:41.122 --> 38:43.198
But it comes with a price.

38:51.875 --> 38:54.376
Everything has its price.

39:44.393 --> 39:45.626
Success.

40:35.143 --> 40:37.743
La Bete Du Gevaudan!

40:37.778 --> 40:39.278
I know your name.

40:42.337 --> 40:44.003
Do you remember mine?

40:47.888 --> 40:49.254
Argent.

40:55.395 --> 40:57.129
Who the hell was that?

40:57.164 --> 40:59.731
You've seen the Beast of Gevaudan.

41:00.700 --> 41:02.433
That was the Man.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.503
Sebastien Valet.
