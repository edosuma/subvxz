WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:06.338
I may not be able to make it.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.406
Right.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.742
Mom, I know
it's your anniversary,

00:09.744 --> 00:12.177
but they may extend me
till October.

00:12.179 --> 00:15.647
Well, it's a war.
I don't control it.

00:15.649 --> 00:19.351
Right, I know. Mom... Okay.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.753
Right, listen, I got to go.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.588
My commander just came in.
We got casualties coming in.

00:22.590 --> 00:26.258
Right.
Love you. Yeah.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

00:57.425 --> 01:00.092
I said,
"what are you doing here?"

01:00.094 --> 01:01.160
Working.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.645
I know that.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.129
I thought maybe you were going
to take a week off,

01:04.131 --> 01:05.614
you know, get settled back in.

01:05.615 --> 01:07.098
I've lost four months
of my chief year.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.734
I'm not taking
any more time off.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.103
Okay.
Welcome back.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.139
- Incoming!
- Who's that?

01:14.141 --> 01:16.241
New intern, man.
She's something else.

01:18.145 --> 01:20.179
What do we got?

01:20.180 --> 01:22.214
Wedding photo at wedding island
gone wrong.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.849
Bride tripped over her heels

01:23.851 --> 01:26.118
bringing the groom with her
into the river.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.720
I'm fine.
Just help my wife, please.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.123
- Shannon.
- On it.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.191
Hey, sit down, sir.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.093
It's easier
if you don't fight us.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.462
- Jordan.
- Drew, hey.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.163
We'll catch up later, okay?

01:39.366 --> 01:40.365
This is the bride.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.600
Possible c-spine injury.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.203
My neck... Really hurts.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.571
I know it does, sweetie.
I'm Dr. Alexander.

01:45.573 --> 01:46.772
I'm going to take care of you.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.107
Can you tell me your name?

01:48.109 --> 01:49.708
Kryztal.
Where's my husband?

01:49.710 --> 01:51.376
He's already inside
getting treated,

01:51.378 --> 01:52.845
so let's get you in there, too.

01:52.847 --> 01:54.279
All right, drew, we got
another one coming.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.547
So let me know
if you need any help.

01:55.549 --> 01:58.350
I won't... Need any help.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.586
The rest of the wedding party.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.654
I got a major emergency here.

02:04.291 --> 02:08.594
Pete here has got
a broken... Heart

02:08.596 --> 02:10.662
from not getting
to nail the hot bridesmaid.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.132
You think that's funny,

02:13.134 --> 02:15.167
you bunch of entitled ass wipes?

02:15.169 --> 02:16.335
Huh?

02:16.337 --> 02:18.137
Hey, people die here, all right?

02:18.139 --> 02:20.205
They bleed on the ground
you're standing on.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.707
Drew, get the patient.
The patient.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.743
I'm with the doc.
Bunch of frat boy a-holes.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.845
This is Jorge,
father of the bride.

02:26.847 --> 02:30.149
He's got a head laceration
and angulated wrist fracture.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.284
Otherwise known as an Owie.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.287
I'm fine, doc.
How's my little girl doing?

02:35.289 --> 02:37.489
Let's get you cleaned up first,
then we'll check on her.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.461
Will there be any celebrities?

02:42.463 --> 02:44.329
Oh, of course, Mrs. Zia.
You'll be here.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.534
Thanks for being here

02:48.536 --> 02:49.801
and blowing off your date.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.703
Oh, I didn't blow it off.
It wasn't a date.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.539
Just going to meet her
later at her place.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.274
My point is thanks
for being my buffer.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.608
Just gotta show her a good time

02:56.610 --> 02:58.644
and then she leaves bright
and early in the morning.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.845
No problem.
I love your mom.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.146
You wouldn't say that

03:01.147 --> 03:02.446
if she came to stay
with you for a month.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.383
It's almost over.
I get my life back.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.422
Oh, this is so exciting.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.225
I love the fancy casinos
in Atlantic city.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.594
Here, guys.
Have a little fun on me.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.780
Drink, gamble.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.965
Maybe you'll find another
hot chick here tonight.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.233
Maybe...

03:25.506 --> 03:26.905
Or maybe not.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.211
This place is a dump,
Christopher.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.946
Why would you bring me here?

03:37.351 --> 03:38.817
- Just keep her busy.
- I got you.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.320
Come on, Mrs. Zia.
Let's go have some fun.

03:45.292 --> 03:48.227
Okay, does this hurt?

03:48.229 --> 03:49.445
No.

03:49.446 --> 03:50.662
All right.
How about here?

03:50.664 --> 03:51.897
A little.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.465
All right.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.701
K, you all right?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.336
I'm fine.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.470
Sorry, he wouldn't sit still.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.738
Wanted to be with his wife.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.341
It's okay. We're going to
take her to CT,

04:02.343 --> 04:03.609
clear her cervical spine.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.377
Is there any news on the father?

04:05.379 --> 04:08.380
Don't waste your breath on him.

04:08.382 --> 04:09.414
Okay.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.316
Just, he ruins everything.

04:11.318 --> 04:12.718
This... this is all his fault.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.685
It's a long story.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.420
It's the same story.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.956
He says he's sober and he's not.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.726
My mother passed last year,

04:20.728 --> 04:24.930
and I just wanted someone
from my family at my wedding.

04:24.932 --> 04:28.300
I... I should've known better.

04:28.302 --> 04:34.306
And he... he... Kryztal?
Kryztal?

04:34.308 --> 04:35.308
Kryztal?

04:37.411 --> 04:38.610
What's happening?!
Help her.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.945
Colles' fracture.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.279
Orthopod should get here
in a few hours.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.815
I'm fine.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.317
All right, good.

04:45.319 --> 04:48.754
Now let's take a look
at this cut here.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.355
Heard the nurses talking.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.958
Army doc, huh?
Where were you stationed?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.459
This time, Bagram.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.729
Was a medic in Iraq, back
when it was the wild west.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.598
Those were the days.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.533
You ever do patrol
on Al-Rashid street

05:01.535 --> 05:03.468
- between Shuhada?
- And the Anhar Bridges.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.703
That crammed bazaar there,

05:04.705 --> 05:06.838
waiting any second
for someone to hit an IED.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.873
That was the hairiest thing

05:07.875 --> 05:09.341
I've ever been through
in my life.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.475
Where were you?

05:10.477 --> 05:13.612
'03, I was chasing down Saddam.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.414
Back in '04 and '05.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.549
Then Kandahar, '07 and '09.

05:17.551 --> 05:20.385
Sounds like you should've
bought some property.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.488
Yeah. Everybody needs
a good mud hut, right?

05:23.490 --> 05:24.823
Yeah.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.427
You married?

05:28.429 --> 05:31.330
To another soldier.

05:31.332 --> 05:34.700
Smart man.
My wife never did get it.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.536
World goes on without you,
you know?

05:37.538 --> 05:39.471
Yeah, I got a friend back there

05:39.473 --> 05:42.007
that's missing her daughter's
13th birthday.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.643
It's all she can think about.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.579
I missed plenty of those.

05:47.581 --> 05:50.415
Recitals, dances, soccer games.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.452
Truth is, my daughter didn't
want me at her wedding.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.886
Well, that sounds
a little harsh.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.388
Yeah.

05:56.390 --> 05:59.758
Irony is that every time
I was out there,

05:59.760 --> 06:03.628
every single time, just
the thought of my daughter

06:03.630 --> 06:05.931
was the only thing
that kept me going.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.868
Yeah.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.036
Please, help her!

06:11.038 --> 06:12.637
Does she have a history
of fainting?

06:12.639 --> 06:13.672
No, no way.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.940
Is it possible she's pregnant?

06:14.942 --> 06:16.308
I don't think so.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.675
I mean, she...
She would've told me.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.411
Any drugs, alcohol?

06:19.413 --> 06:21.380
No. Yeah, actually.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.815
She's taking anti-anxiety
medicine for the wedding.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.150
She's so high-strung,

06:25.152 --> 06:27.686
she was having bad dreams
and nightmares.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.388
Okay. Can you tell me the names
of these medications?

06:29.390 --> 06:31.690
I... I don't know.
I'm sorry. I don't know.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.991
All right.
Let's get her to CT.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.527
Can I go with her?

06:35.529 --> 06:37.029
Once she's conscious, you can.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.530
But we have to take her
for some scans, all right?

06:38.532 --> 06:39.698
We'll be back.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.934
I love you, k!

07:03.690 --> 07:06.024
5.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.993
No more underhand throws,
old man.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.594
And no more lip, dollface.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.763
Unless you want
to plant them on mine.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.031
If you don't crap out,

07:13.033 --> 07:15.534
I'll do whatever you want
with my eyes open.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.102
Oh.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.669
Who's this child?
Is that your boyfriend?

07:18.672 --> 07:21.606
Maybe he is.
Maybe he isn't.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.775
You just broke my heart.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.913
- Ah. Come on.
- Easy 4.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.614
She crushed me.
What can I say?

07:29.616 --> 07:33.084
If you give him some love,
he'll get back on a roll.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.220
Stop shooting blanks, old man.

07:35.222 --> 07:38.223
I'll give you my number
if you roll me something good.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.658
Well, now I got incentive.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.493
No, no, you don't,
and no, you won't.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.078
What's going on here?

07:43.079 --> 07:44.662
I take one call from Janet,
and you're playing craps?

07:44.665 --> 07:46.081
What happened to bingo?

07:46.082 --> 07:47.498
Hey, your mother
won't be kept down.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.034
I don't know.
She's good.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.568
Bingo is boring.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.704
Why would you bring me
to a casino to play bingo?

07:52.706 --> 07:55.607
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.608
There you go.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.709
Hard 10, yeah!

07:57.711 --> 07:59.044
- Yes!
- Yes!

07:59.046 --> 08:00.145
- Yes!
- Yes!

08:00.147 --> 08:01.713
Oh.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.533
- Oh.
- Oh, hey.

08:04.534 --> 08:05.817
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.118
No one touch this table.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.921
- Hey. Hands off.
- Okay. Okay.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.823
Hey.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.592
Pulse is pounding.
150s, at least.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.559
Regular rhythm?

08:14.561 --> 08:16.061
Yeah, probably svt.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.562
He's unstable.
We need to cardiovert.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.598
Grab the defibrillator off
the wall, right there, now.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.599
Go.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.666
Let's go! Let's go!

08:23.604 --> 08:24.936
Come on.
Thank you.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.574
Okay, ready?

08:29.576 --> 08:30.876
- Clear.
- Clear.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.678
No battery?!
Come on!

08:33.679 --> 08:34.746
I called the ambulance,

08:34.748 --> 08:36.280
but they're coming
from the city,

08:36.283 --> 08:37.549
at least half an hour.

08:37.549 --> 08:38.816
Okay. Toph, he doesn't
have that long.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.684
No, no, he doesn't.
Okay.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.621
Hey, Jocelyn,
can you let me know

08:43.624 --> 08:44.656
when Kryztal gets out of CT?

08:44.658 --> 08:45.991
- Yes, Dr. Alexander.
- Thank you.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.993
So what's up
with your fireman Sam?

08:47.995 --> 08:50.595
His buddy Jonah tells me
you two went out again?

08:50.597 --> 08:52.314
Your place or his?

08:52.315 --> 08:54.032
Seriously, did we not
just have this conversation

08:54.034 --> 08:55.600
about how when you're at work,

08:55.602 --> 08:57.669
I am your supervisor,
not your friend?

08:57.671 --> 09:00.572
Okay, I don't want to discuss
my personal life here,

09:00.574 --> 09:03.575
and if I do happen to tell you
something personal off hours,

09:03.577 --> 09:05.544
I don't want you
to discuss it here.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.279
I've been the topic
of enough gossip

09:07.281 --> 09:08.647
to last me a lifetime.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.648
- Got it.
- Oh, yeah?

09:09.650 --> 09:12.684
Nurse?
Can I get a little help?

09:12.686 --> 09:15.086
My, um, my leg hurts.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.689
Yeah.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.224
You know what?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.758
I'm going to let you
get that one.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.561
Sure.
After my next patient.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.695
- Jordan?
- Oh, hey.

09:23.697 --> 09:24.863
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.097
I did not get to greet you
properly earlier.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.866
- Yeah, there was a lot going on.
- Yeah.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.234
What's going on with Kryztal?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.452
Her dad wants to know.

09:30.453 --> 09:31.669
He's been asking about her
every two minutes.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.180
He wants to see her.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.689
I think it would do him so good.

09:34.690 --> 09:36.198
This whole wedding thing
has gotten him a little upset.

09:36.199 --> 09:37.707
Yeah, I don't think
it's a good idea right now.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.344
Why not?

09:39.345 --> 09:40.978
Well, she made it
pretty clear from her part

09:40.981 --> 09:42.948
that they're not that close,

09:42.950 --> 09:45.784
and she feels like
he ruined her wedding.

09:45.786 --> 09:46.952
Oh, did he push her
in the river?

09:46.954 --> 09:49.087
I... I'm just saying
that I don't think

09:49.089 --> 09:51.790
it's a good idea and that
we shouldn't get involved.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.024
Why are you so upset by this?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.759
'Cause I hate it
when people don't respect

09:54.761 --> 09:55.694
what someone like him
has been through.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.879
No one's saying that.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.063
Yeah, he told me he missed
a lot of things,

09:58.065 --> 09:59.297
but he was at war
defending his country,

09:59.299 --> 10:00.699
so I think that's
a pretty good excuse

10:00.701 --> 10:02.518
for missing
a few softball games.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.336
I... I totally agree,
but from what she said,

10:04.338 --> 10:07.038
it's more to do with him
being an alcoholic.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.006
Yeah, I wonder if five tours

10:08.008 --> 10:10.025
has anything to do with that.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.043
Um... Okay, look, drew,
you... You just got back.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.612
You're a little raw.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.747
That's not what this is about.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.649
I'm speaking up for my patient.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.784
And I'm speaking up for mine.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.654
Okay, she's high-strung,
she's fainting.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.189
Please, let me fix my patient

10:24.191 --> 10:26.958
before we decide to solve
any of the family issues.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.662
For now, we'll just... we'll
have to agree to disagree.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.665
You'd think after everything
you went through with T.C.,

10:33.667 --> 10:35.734
you'd be on that guy's side.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.238
I checked all four aeds,
all missing their batteries.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.673
I found an amp bag.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.107
Toph, his pulse
is getting weaker.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.677
We need to get him back
in sinus asap.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.714
Uh, what about
cold water immersion?

10:49.716 --> 10:51.249
Stimulate his diving reflex.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.817
Good idea.
Got...

10:53.687 --> 10:55.186
All right.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.496
Let's make some room.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.097
Okay, make some room,
make some room, come on.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.065
Give them some room.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.833
The doctor says he needs room.

11:08.835 --> 11:09.868
Here, hold this.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.137
Ready? Let's go.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.877
There we go.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.745
There we go.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.747
Thank you.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.883
There we go.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.719
Yeah, his pulse
is back to normal.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.688
Amazing.
T.C. Saved him!

11:29.690 --> 11:30.989
That was amazing.

11:32.759 --> 11:35.694
It was all Topher's idea,
Mrs. Zia.

11:35.696 --> 11:36.761
I was just the busboy.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.798
You're too modest, Dr. Callahan.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.332
We'll get you training
with Topher, man.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.101
Little cycling,
we'll get you on schedule.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.402
- That's...
- Look, no biggie.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.404
That's great, man.
Hey, listen, one other thing.

11:46.406 --> 11:50.275
I know you guys, I know
you like teasing Paul.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.743
And I get that.

11:51.744 --> 11:53.210
But I would really appreciate it

11:53.213 --> 11:55.447
if you toned it down
just a little bit.

11:55.449 --> 11:57.348
I just don't want it
affecting his work.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.983
No problem.
I'll spread the word.

11:58.985 --> 12:00.819
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.090
Oh.
Hey, bro.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.891
- Hey.
- How you doing?

12:06.893 --> 12:09.294
Great. What was that...
That with Scott?

12:09.296 --> 12:11.830
Uh, he... he wants me to...
He wants me

12:11.832 --> 12:13.865
to train him,
get him back in shape.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.767
You know, chicks love the abs.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.001
Right, right.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.204
So... so he wasn't saying
anything about me?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.306
And before you answer,
I will remind you

12:21.308 --> 12:23.341
that I have the hearing
of an elephant.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.143
Okay, fine.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.879
He asked us to stop messing
with you,

12:27.881 --> 12:28.880
and I said we would.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.750
He... he didn't need
to do that.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.151
Makes me look bad,

12:33.153 --> 12:34.919
like I can't take care
of myself, you know?

12:34.921 --> 12:36.821
Hey, tell him, not me.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.796
- T? T?
- Yeah.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.931
I'm telling you, she loves you,
you love casinos.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.366
Toph, Toph, if you leave now,

12:48.368 --> 12:49.868
she will never let you
hear the end of it.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.035
Yeah, that's true.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.270
She's getting up there, man.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.522
Come on, you complain,

12:53.523 --> 12:54.773
but what if it's her last visit?

12:54.775 --> 12:57.242
Hey, my mom, she's going
to outlive me.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.810
Okay.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.979
You know, I said
the same thing about my mom,

13:00.981 --> 13:02.781
and you know when
I got to tell her

13:02.783 --> 13:04.416
what she meant to me?

13:04.417 --> 13:06.050
Over a respirator
on her coma bed.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.486
Maybe she heard,
maybe she didn't.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.989
Time to go, guys.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.527
All right, you go, I'll stay.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.430
Worst case, get drunk,
call an uber.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.101
I've had enough people
in my life

13:23.103 --> 13:25.036
trying to fix things for me,

13:25.038 --> 13:26.271
you know, and I'm tired of it.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.907
I get that.
I do, but you see my point?

13:28.909 --> 13:31.810
I need the E.R. and
the surgical departments

13:31.812 --> 13:34.946
to work well together and
if they don't respect you...

13:34.948 --> 13:36.214
Well, they... they will.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.550
Look, I'm... I'm not
the rah-rah guy.

13:38.552 --> 13:40.451
I'm the lead by example guy.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.588
They will follow me.
It just might take a bit longer.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.925
You know, maybe... maybe
it's not your way or T.C.'S,

13:46.927 --> 13:48.993
but, you know,
I could do it my way.

13:48.995 --> 13:52.463
Okay. All right.
Let's see how that goes.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.067
So what's up?

13:56.069 --> 13:58.837
Just, um, something wrong
right here.

13:58.839 --> 14:02.974
It hurts, so you might
need to examine it.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.610
Okay.
Well, let me take a look.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.078
Drop your pants, let's see it.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.047
See it?

14:09.049 --> 14:11.416
Yes. It. Your penis.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.985
That's clearly what
you're hinting at, right?

14:13.987 --> 14:16.221
I'm just letting you know
that my leg...

14:16.223 --> 14:18.089
Come on, you started this joke.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.958
Let's...
Let's see it through.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.026
Let's... let's see
how big you are.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.329
My guess is
you're an inch-worm.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.097
Big-mouth guys
usually are.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.999
Everything okay here?

14:28.001 --> 14:31.002
Huh. Yeah,
I think we're good here.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.320
Right, guys?

14:32.321 --> 14:33.637
You've all learned
a valuable lesson

14:33.640 --> 14:35.440
about wasting
a doctor's time, right?

14:35.442 --> 14:39.410
And you, hipster dude,
give me your phone.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.112
I know you were
taking a picture.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.280
Come on.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.648
You're lucky I don't break this.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.450
Oh. Nice.
Crop shot.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.651
Delete.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.422
Holy.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.124
This is one right
before she tripped.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.525
Look, push in
and you can see her eyes

14:54.527 --> 14:56.094
already rolling back
in her head.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.196
Yeah, so she didn't trip,
she fainted.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.331
Nice find.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.599
So what does that mean?

15:01.601 --> 15:03.468
Well, I'm going to
have radiology

15:03.470 --> 15:06.271
read your scan right away,
so we can figure this out.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.073
But for now, I'm going to have
Dr. Rivera stay with you, okay?

15:10.944 --> 15:12.377
Let's scoot you over.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.148
I can't get over
calling you Dr. Rivera.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.683
You look like my age.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.085
Well, I can't get over the fact

15:21.087 --> 15:23.421
that you're my age
and you're married.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.256
It just made sense, I guess.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.225
You got anyone special?

15:27.227 --> 15:30.595
You mean, someone
I've swiped right on?

15:30.597 --> 15:34.499
Nah. Marriage is
the last thing on my mind.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.534
Well, that may change when
you meet the right person.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.202
I don't have time
for the right person.

15:38.204 --> 15:41.639
I come from a small town,
like a really small town.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.474
They paid for my med school

15:43.476 --> 15:46.044
and they're sort of
depending on me,

15:46.046 --> 15:49.280
so I don't have time for someone
special in my schedule,

15:49.282 --> 15:50.381
until say, 2025.

15:52.953 --> 15:53.985
I know what you're saying.

15:53.987 --> 15:57.121
You think I'm drunk,
right? Huh?

15:57.123 --> 15:58.590
I'm not good enough?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.058
- Nobody's saying that.
- Everybody said it!

16:00.060 --> 16:02.060
I heard them at the wedding.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.194
Your labs came back clean.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.595
I can tell you didn't drink.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.264
All right, I'll tell them that.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.498
All right.
It'll be fine.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.950
- Jorge?
- You!

16:08.951 --> 16:10.401
- Hey, what's going on?
- Not true, not true.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.970
- No, listen.
- Get away from me!

16:11.972 --> 16:13.004
- Get back!
- Hey, hey, hey!

16:13.006 --> 16:14.138
Okay.
All right, all right.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.206
- Get away from me.
- Okay.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.273
- Get away from me!
- Everybody, back!

16:16.276 --> 16:17.542
Stay in the rooms!
What happened?

16:17.544 --> 16:19.077
No idea.
He just went crazy.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.511
- Get away from me!
- Please drop the scalpel.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.013
- Let us help you, okay?
- Get them away!

16:22.015 --> 16:24.115
Drop the scalpel.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.217
No, no, no.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.485
Talk to us.
What's going on?

16:27.487 --> 16:30.621
You see them?
Do you see them?!

16:30.623 --> 16:32.290
- It's okay.
- Get them off of me!

16:32.292 --> 16:33.358
Jorge, we will.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.326
- I got this.
- No, no, no!

16:45.171 --> 16:46.604
Get some restraints!

16:53.680 --> 16:57.148
Okay, he's fully sedated.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.217
Let's get him to trauma 3.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.089
- What did he do now?
- He started another fight?

17:05.090 --> 17:06.790
No, he didn't start a fight,
okay?

17:06.792 --> 17:08.492
- He wasn't himself.
- What?

17:08.494 --> 17:10.228
Your father's hurting
right now, okay?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.194
You should reach out to him.
He needs you.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.814
He needs me?

17:12.815 --> 17:14.432
He wasn't there for me
when I needed him.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.134
And who are you?

17:16.136 --> 17:17.535
Okay. All right.
What the hell are you doing?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.170
I was just explaining
her father's situation.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.204
No, you were lobbying for him
and you need to back off.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.607
- I don't feel very well.
- Jordan.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.289
- What's wrong? Kryztal.
- She's out again.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.179
She's in v-tach.
We need a crash cart.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.581
I can't believe you rushed
a guy with a scalpel.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.551
I don't know, man,
I just... I just reacted.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.753
Yeah, I mean,
that's what I thought

17:35.755 --> 17:37.688
last year at the accident.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.591
Almost cost me my career.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.227
Yeah, but look at you now.

17:43.229 --> 17:46.264
Gonna be a bad-ass surgeon
just like your pops.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.102
Hey, I'm... I'm proud
of you, man.

17:51.104 --> 17:54.439
Uh-huh.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.275
Yeah, this part of Scott's
request or something?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.609
No, no, I'm being serious.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.112
When you first got here,
man, you were like...

18:01.114 --> 18:02.780
You were like a scared
little mouse, man.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.818
You'd sweat,
your voice would crack.

18:06.820 --> 18:09.087
Yeah, that's your compliment?

18:09.089 --> 18:10.388
Yeah, that's my compliment.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.657
- Got it.
- I'm saying how far you've come.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.164
Thanks, man.
Uh...

18:20.166 --> 18:23.267
That really means a lot.
You saying...

18:23.269 --> 18:25.103
Come on, don't get
all emotional on me now.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.171
No, no.
I'm... I'm not.

18:27.173 --> 18:32.743
I'm just... with my hand
surgery, and the rehab...

18:32.745 --> 18:36.214
It's all I've dreamed of
ever since I was 5.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.482
Hmm.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.817
You know, I guess... I guess
you just don't know

18:39.819 --> 18:41.819
how much you really want
something

18:41.821 --> 18:43.888
until you almost lose it,
you know?

18:43.890 --> 18:45.556
Yeah, I do.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.425
Yeah.

18:47.427 --> 18:51.395
I figured I'd be finishing up
my NFL career by now.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.432
But here I am.

18:54.434 --> 18:58.302
Yeah, but I mean
you love being a nurse.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.371
Yeah, I do.
I do.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.441
But it wasn't my dream
since I was 5.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.349
Come on.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.583
Please, you got to help me.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.584
Doc, you got to help me.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.186
You called for a trauma consult?

19:15.188 --> 19:16.888
Yeah, blunt head trauma
with worsening mental state.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.756
May have sustained a brain bleed
or a concussion,

19:18.758 --> 19:19.790
so we're going to get him a CT.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.559
- Let's go.
- I don't feel good.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.627
I don't feel good.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.328
You just got to relax,
Jorge, okay?

19:24.330 --> 19:26.264
- We're going to do a CT...
- No! Don't you touch me!

19:26.266 --> 19:28.900
Don't you touch me!

19:28.902 --> 19:31.836
Type and cross for 4.
Page GI. Let's go.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.938
Her EKG is totally normal.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.207
It shouldn't be, but it is.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.409
You needed
a cardiac surgery consult?

19:38.411 --> 19:40.545
Yeah. Where's Scott?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.613
He's busy. Sent me.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.615
Dr. Alexander?

19:44.617 --> 19:49.487
Okay. We have a seemingly
healthy young female.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.923
She fainted twice,
went into v-tach,

19:51.925 --> 19:53.791
but now her EKG looks normal.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.227
I agree.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.313
Any other symptoms?

19:58.314 --> 20:00.398
Yeah, anxiety.
Probably pre-existing.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.267
I have a list of anti-anxiety
medications that she's on.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.052
Okay.

20:05.053 --> 20:07.213
And her husband mentioned
she's been having nightmares.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.542
Nightmares?

20:11.544 --> 20:13.444
Trouble sleeping.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.246
You have an idea?

20:17.283 --> 20:19.350
Yeah, I... I do.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.719
Yeah.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.263
So, ma, you have everything
you need

20:32.265 --> 20:33.998
for your trip tomorrow?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.968
Is that all
you're thinking about?

20:36.970 --> 20:38.536
Getting rid of me?

20:38.538 --> 20:42.607
No.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.976
No.

20:44.978 --> 20:50.581
Just... Lynn and the twins

20:50.583 --> 20:52.950
really loved having you here.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.319
That's because kids
respond to discipline,

20:55.321 --> 20:56.621
not that Janet would know.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.422
Stop! Stop!

21:00.660 --> 21:04.662
Why do you have to be so...
So critical about my wife?

21:04.664 --> 21:07.331
About my kids? About me?

21:09.302 --> 21:12.036
I'm the one who found the save
for the old man.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.538
I'm the hero!

21:14.540 --> 21:15.840
Stop yelling.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.542
It makes your face turn red.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.712
There you go again.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.814
Why are you like that?

21:25.485 --> 21:28.419
You're so content to just be.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.520
You're my son.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.756
You're supposed to be better.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.625
Better?

21:34.627 --> 21:36.927
I'm a doctor.

21:36.929 --> 21:40.064
I'm... no, I'm the chief
of the E.R.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.500
At a major trauma center.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.368
I was an army ranger.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.536
I have not one,

21:45.538 --> 21:48.572
but three beautiful,
intelligent daughters

21:48.574 --> 21:53.377
and an incredible wife,
who, I'm going to tell you,

21:53.379 --> 21:56.814
finds you as aggravating
as I do.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.551
How can you say that

22:00.553 --> 22:03.921
To your mother?
I raised you.

22:06.993 --> 22:11.429
You...
You terrorized me.

22:11.431 --> 22:15.032
And you're...
You're still doing it.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.802
Nothing is ever good enough
for you.

22:17.804 --> 22:20.104
I can't... I can't win.

22:21.774 --> 22:26.110
I'm not going to... I'm not
going to take it anymore.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.879
I mean, seriously, what'd
you ever do with your life?

22:36.422 --> 22:38.022
Mom. Mom.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.802
Hey. Thought you had
the night off.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.421
Yeah, so did I.

22:53.422 --> 22:55.039
An elderly patient
with hypotension,

22:55.041 --> 22:56.474
svt, converted on scene.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.908
Got to get him
to the Cath lab, stat.

22:57.910 --> 22:58.976
Okay, I'll get somebody to...

22:58.978 --> 23:00.445
Hey, I got this.

23:00.446 --> 23:01.913
You ever known me
to pass off a patient?

23:01.914 --> 23:03.554
- Nice to meet you, Sam.
- See you around.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.956
So when was the last time
you had a drink?

23:11.958 --> 23:15.092
I don't drink.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.895
Yeah. Dr. Alister said
that your blood alcohol test

23:17.897 --> 23:20.898
did come back negative,
but I'm going to ask you again,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.601
when was the last time
you had a drink?

23:23.603 --> 23:28.472
You puked up blood,
Jorge. You know why?

23:28.474 --> 23:30.174
Because you got
ruptured varicose veins

23:30.176 --> 23:31.041
in your esophagus.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.511
They're called varices.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.980
It's the result of drinking.
A lot of drinking.

23:35.982 --> 23:39.183
Your shaking, your paranoia,
your delusions...

23:39.185 --> 23:42.620
These are all symptoms
of delirium tremens,

23:42.622 --> 23:45.189
which is a severe form
of alcohol withdrawal.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.824
I'm sober.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.092
Hey, we're trying
to help you here.

23:48.094 --> 23:52.196
Okay?
Just tell us the truth.

23:56.903 --> 24:03.007
I... I wanted to be clean
for her wedding.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.576
I thought I could do it, man.

24:05.578 --> 24:08.846
The last drink I had was
on the plane, I swear.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.682
Okay.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.185
All right, man.
That's good.

24:14.187 --> 24:15.686
Admitting it is a good start.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.755
And you can't stop
like that again, though.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.191
You saw what happens.
Next time, it could be worse.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.830
My daughter...

24:25.832 --> 24:28.132
She saw me getting restrained,
didn't she?

24:28.134 --> 24:29.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:32.205 --> 24:36.640
Could one of you ask if I could
see her for a minute?

24:36.642 --> 24:39.610
- Yeah.
- Of course.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.512
Hello?

24:41.514 --> 24:45.115
I'm a man, I'm a doctor,
and I'm looking for my mother.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.517
I'm coming in.

24:52.058 --> 24:55.893
Mom,
I... I'm really sorry.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.928
I don't know why
I said that stuff.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.865
I wasn't always nothing,
you know?

25:00.867 --> 25:03.133
I know. I know.

25:04.770 --> 25:07.071
You worked your ass off
at those restaurants.

25:07.073 --> 25:09.573
I should be more grateful.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.614
I was an engineer.

25:16.616 --> 25:19.083
What?

25:19.084 --> 25:21.551
Yes. I went to school
in Hong Kong

25:21.554 --> 25:25.155
before you were born
to be an engineer.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.857
Are you serious?

25:26.859 --> 25:28.158
Yes.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.195
We moved to the United States.

25:33.165 --> 25:36.767
And it was hard.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.302
The language.

25:40.640 --> 25:44.708
And then your father died.

25:44.710 --> 25:49.013
And I had to give it all up

25:49.015 --> 25:52.082
to work at that crappy
dragon palace,

25:52.084 --> 25:55.119
just to keep you
and your sister alive.

25:55.121 --> 25:58.122
Do you think I liked that?

25:58.124 --> 26:01.926
Who knows what I could've done.

26:01.928 --> 26:06.163
Why didn't you tell me
that before, mom?

26:06.165 --> 26:12.169
Because... It was my job
to make sure

26:12.171 --> 26:17.341
you were given every opportunity
to do great things...

26:20.746 --> 26:25.349
the things that I couldn't do.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.187
And you did them.

26:37.830 --> 26:40.631
And I am proud of you.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.976
Can... can I hug you,
mom?

26:51.978 --> 26:56.747
I know it's... It's weird,
and we don't really do that.

27:05.992 --> 27:09.960
Kryztal, you have something
called brugada syndrome.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.295
It explains why you're fainting

27:11.297 --> 27:13.163
and why your heart
almost stopped.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.966
It was actually the nightmares
that tipped me off.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.551
It's a symptom.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.135
It's an electrical problem
in your heart

27:19.138 --> 27:21.238
that could cause
sudden cardiac death

27:21.240 --> 27:22.240
if not treated.

27:23.876 --> 27:26.310
So what do we do?
Is there a cure?

27:26.312 --> 27:30.648
Yes. We treat it with
an implantable defibrillator.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.950
You have to attach this
to my heart.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.284
Is there another way?

27:34.286 --> 27:35.386
I'm afraid there isn't.

27:35.388 --> 27:36.871
And if we don't do this,

27:36.872 --> 27:38.632
you could go into cardiac arrest
at any time.

27:42.361 --> 27:43.927
Also, I think you should know

27:43.929 --> 27:46.296
that there's a genetic component
to brugada syndrome.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.699
It's... it's inherited.

27:48.701 --> 27:52.870
And your father has
the condition, as well.

27:54.874 --> 27:59.677
Kryztal, look, I know
that you're hurting,

27:59.679 --> 28:01.278
and you're scared.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.281
But your father is, too,

28:04.283 --> 28:06.917
and he would really like
to see you.

28:06.919 --> 28:09.286
Yeah.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.221
Well, too bad.

28:11.223 --> 28:14.425
On top of being a drunk
and ruining my past,

28:14.427 --> 28:17.061
my dad's also ruined my future.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.462
I never want to see him again.

28:35.948 --> 28:39.049
Hey, I wouldn't jump
on that tuna sandwich.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.085
It's been there
since bush was president.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.120
Oh, that's gross.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.722
Yeah.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.323
So, I... I hear your night

28:46.325 --> 28:49.326
of fun and debauchery got cut short.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.330
Nothing says debauchery
like a casino

28:53.332 --> 28:55.966
full of 80-year-olds
with air tanks and walkers.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.000
Yeah.

28:57.002 --> 28:58.202
Poor Toph.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.037
His mom is really
driving him crazy.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.839
- Yeah, she's still on his case?
- Nonstop.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.044
Yeah.
How's your bride doing?

29:07.046 --> 29:08.946
Well, she's on her way
to the O.R.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.414
Instead of her honeymoon.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.083
That's a big change of plans.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.352
For better or worse, right?

29:15.354 --> 29:17.054
Yeah.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.123
See, that's where we were smart.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.859
We spread our worst out
over eight years.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.060
Yeah, we did.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.030
But there was
a lot of good, too.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.838
I really do want you
to be happy.

29:36.958 --> 29:39.158
I want the same for you.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.498
Hey.
Cardiology called.

29:44.499 --> 29:46.816
The old guy only wants the doc
that dunked him in the water.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.852
Okay.
I'll be right there.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.420
I'm not even going to ask.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.389
Yeah. Don't.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.792
Okay.
One tuna sandwich.

29:54.794 --> 29:55.977
Oh, you're not really
going to buy that, are you?

29:55.978 --> 29:57.618
Oh, no, just making sure
nobody else does.

30:05.538 --> 30:09.239
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:09.241 --> 30:12.042
How you feeling?

30:12.044 --> 30:14.178
Just tell me how I'm doing.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.513
Don't be a pussy.
Spit it out.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.018
You're going to need
open-heart surgery.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.086
Let's do it.

30:23.088 --> 30:28.192
Yeah. The problem is that
your heart stopped twice

30:28.194 --> 30:32.062
during the Cath procedure, so...

30:32.064 --> 30:34.131
You need the operation,

30:34.133 --> 30:37.467
but you're probably not
going to survive it.

30:41.006 --> 30:44.107
Yeah.

30:44.109 --> 30:48.111
You got any... Friends
or family I can call?

30:48.113 --> 30:51.215
All my friends, they're dead.

30:51.217 --> 30:55.485
Family, never had one.

30:57.857 --> 31:03.160
I was too busy...
Trying to get laid.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.096
Don't look at me like that.

31:06.098 --> 31:09.099
When I was your age, I was
better-looking than you

31:09.101 --> 31:11.335
and I could kick your ass
with my eyes closed.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.070
Oh, yeah.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.404
I believe it.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.908
Oh, man.
Holy cow.

31:19.511 --> 31:20.978
You stay for awhile?

31:22.514 --> 31:24.982
Sure.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.884
I'll stay as long as you want.

31:35.961 --> 31:37.094
Doctor, hold on.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.264
Can I talk to him?

31:40.266 --> 31:44.301
He's already sedated
for surgery.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.335
Sorry.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.504
Oh.

31:47.506 --> 31:48.972
Go.

31:54.680 --> 31:59.383
He looks so small... so worn.

32:00.552 --> 32:03.420
You think I'm a terrible
person, don't you,

32:03.422 --> 32:05.589
for not wanting to speak to him?

32:05.591 --> 32:10.560
I think I have no right
to judge anybody on anything.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.679
Hey.

32:30.716 --> 32:34.184
Hey.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.322
How's Jorge?

32:38.324 --> 32:40.123
Not great.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.225
Drew, I'm sorry about earlier.

32:42.227 --> 32:46.296
I wasn't as sensitive to you
as I should've been.

32:46.298 --> 32:50.534
No. I... You were
just trying to help.

32:50.536 --> 32:52.235
Yeah, but you just got back
and...

32:52.237 --> 32:53.704
Jordan, I know the hell
you went through

32:53.706 --> 32:55.205
with T.C.
When he first came back.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.442
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.212
Forget it.

33:05.551 --> 33:08.318
This wasn't about me
coming back too soon.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.387
This case just brought up
some other stuff

33:10.389 --> 33:11.655
that I didn't want to admit to.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.224
Like what?

33:14.226 --> 33:16.460
I haven't told my parents
I'm back.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.996
It's their 40th anniversary.
I'm supposed to go.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.265
But I can't,
'cause I'm too scared

33:22.267 --> 33:24.234
to tell 'em that Rick
and I got married.

33:27.072 --> 33:30.707
Um... But they know
you're out, right?

33:30.709 --> 33:33.010
Yeah.

33:36.749 --> 33:39.783
See, growing up, my dad and I
used to be best friends.

33:39.785 --> 33:43.620
We watched games together,
went to games together,

33:43.622 --> 33:45.122
we played every sport.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.424
We did everything together.

33:51.096 --> 33:53.630
And then when I came out to him,

33:53.632 --> 33:57.334
it's like he couldn't talk
to me anymore.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.102
Honey, I'm so sorry.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.339
It's the same
Steelers game, right?

34:02.341 --> 34:04.141
I mean, what's the difference?

34:05.310 --> 34:06.550
But to him, it had all changed.

34:08.795 --> 34:11.112
So I figure
if I don't say anything,

34:11.116 --> 34:17.788
maybe for a year or two...
You know,

34:17.790 --> 34:20.456
maybe there's
that glimmer of hope.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.826
Even if it's just 1% that...

34:25.330 --> 34:26.530
he'll change and then things

34:26.532 --> 34:28.431
can go back to the way
they used to be.

34:40.746 --> 34:48.284
Drew, you know, your...
Your dad's getting older.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.219
And how are you going to feel

34:50.222 --> 34:52.688
if you don't get the chance
to talk to him?

35:02.667 --> 35:04.734
He's crashing.
Get the crash cart now.

35:24.323 --> 35:27.591
Look, I don't care if you
dated T.C. Or Dr. Clemmens.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.560
Believe it or not, I may
have dated other women

35:30.562 --> 35:32.462
before I went out with you.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.548
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.633
I'm just saying that
some guys have a hard time

35:36.635 --> 35:39.669
working with other guys
that have dated the woman

35:39.671 --> 35:41.638
that they may or may not
be interested in.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.374
Well, I'm not like
those other guys.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.009
That's good.

35:46.010 --> 35:47.643
And I'm definitely interested
in a woman

35:47.646 --> 35:49.146
they may have dated.

35:49.148 --> 35:51.548
In fact, I'd love to make her

35:51.550 --> 35:54.217
a gourmet breakfast
this morning.

35:54.219 --> 35:56.353
Oh?
A gourmet breakfast?

35:56.355 --> 35:58.622
Hmm. How many times
have you used that line?

35:58.624 --> 36:00.157
Oh, this is the first time.

36:00.159 --> 36:01.791
- I swear.
- Uh-huh.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.529
So what do you say?

36:05.531 --> 36:08.165
Truffle omelet at my place
around 9:00?

36:10.202 --> 36:14.304
Why don't you make it
8:45?

36:16.475 --> 36:18.241
<i>Dr. Alexander to recovery.</i>

36:18.243 --> 36:22.512
He was always the best
at everything.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.649
You brought your mom.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.417
You've been avoiding that
all month.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.486
Yeah, what the hell?
Let her brag about her boy.

36:29.488 --> 36:31.221
You know, I have to say,

36:31.223 --> 36:33.623
it all turned out
pretty damn good.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.458
We had a conversation.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.261
I mean, I'm still glad
she's leaving,

36:38.263 --> 36:40.497
but that conversation,

36:40.499 --> 36:42.699
it opened up a whole new side
of our relationship.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.768
By the way, how's...
How's the old man?

36:44.770 --> 36:47.604
Clive?
He's all patched up.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.739
He'll probably be back
at the casino in a week.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.842
Cemetery... 3-6 months.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.277
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:54.279 --> 36:56.646
Yeah. Don't be.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.282
He, uh, had an amazing life.

36:59.284 --> 37:01.551
He gets to go out
the way he wants.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.220
That's all we can ask for,
right?

37:03.222 --> 37:04.754
Hey, the shift's about to end,
guys.

37:04.756 --> 37:09.226
Remember what we talked about...
"ethey artypay orfay ewdray."

37:09.228 --> 37:11.461
- What'd she say?
- I have no idea.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.630
The welcome home party for drew.
Let's go.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.665
Why... why didn't you
just say that?

37:16.935 --> 37:20.003
Took us a little bit
longer than expected,

37:20.005 --> 37:21.638
but your surgery went well,

37:21.640 --> 37:23.974
and you should be feeling
like yourself in no time.

37:23.976 --> 37:27.544
So the nightmare wedding
saved your life.

37:27.546 --> 37:30.880
See? I knew
I was right marrying you.

37:32.818 --> 37:36.386
And how was my dad's surgery?

37:38.924 --> 37:41.691
The surgeons got into his heart

37:41.693 --> 37:44.794
and the years of alcohol
had already destroyed it.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.533
He's gone.

37:50.535 --> 37:52.869
I'm so sorry, Kryztal.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.959
Dad, hey.

38:49.961 --> 38:53.496
Yeah, it's me.

38:53.498 --> 38:56.333
Yeah, no, I know.
I just wanted to...

38:56.335 --> 38:59.869
Right.

38:59.871 --> 39:03.707
Dad, just... Yeah,
I just called,

39:03.709 --> 39:05.709
'cause there's something
I need to tell you.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.348
Drew?

39:13.452 --> 39:14.818
Drew?

39:16.488 --> 39:17.921
Hey.

39:17.923 --> 39:20.757
I called my dad.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.360
Okay.
How'd it go?

39:25.731 --> 39:26.996
Oh, sweetie.
It's okay.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.631
Come here.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.467
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

39:30.469 --> 39:31.968
- Aw.
- Sorry. Sorry.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.970
I was... I was running late.

39:33.972 --> 39:36.072
- Where's drew?
- Who knows?

39:36.074 --> 39:38.942
But I'm starving,
so I'm not waiting.

39:38.944 --> 39:42.879
But first, I... I'd like
to make a toast to my mom.

39:42.881 --> 39:48.818
Thank you for reminding me what
it takes to be a great parent,

39:48.820 --> 39:53.990
dedication to your family, and
putting them above all else.

39:53.992 --> 39:54.924
To you, mom.

39:54.926 --> 39:55.892
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.827
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.063
Mama Toph.
Speech.

40:00.065 --> 40:03.933
Okay, well...

40:03.935 --> 40:07.937
I've always known that
Christopher was the best

40:07.939 --> 40:11.841
and brightest, but to hear
from his colleagues...

40:11.843 --> 40:14.277
- He is.
- He's amazing.

40:14.278 --> 40:16.712
It just helps me know that
I've made the right decision.

40:16.715 --> 40:20.950
I'm so proud of my son Don't.

40:20.952 --> 40:24.087
That I'm coming to live
with him permanently.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.589
- Wow.
- Congratulations.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.759
- Yeah.
- Good to have family around.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.528
Son of a bitch.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.462
Yeah.

40:32.464 --> 40:33.496
She planned it.

40:33.498 --> 40:34.531
Yeah.

40:34.533 --> 40:35.965
She did it in front of everyone,

40:35.967 --> 40:37.867
'cause she knew
I couldn't refuse.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.402
She used all of us as a buffer.

40:39.403 --> 40:40.936
- She played me, she played me.
- Yeah.

40:42.908 --> 40:45.008
Nice catch tonight, Paul.

40:45.010 --> 40:48.044
Like you said,
you're a leader by example.

40:53.585 --> 40:56.853
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

40:59.925 --> 41:02.892
Okay, I would like
to propose a toast, actually.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.833
To having our family
back together again.

41:10.936 --> 41:13.136
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:13.138 --> 41:14.804
Uh, thank you.

41:14.806 --> 41:17.907
You have... No idea
how much I needed this.

41:17.909 --> 41:20.210
So thank you so much.

41:20.212 --> 41:23.713
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Thank you.
