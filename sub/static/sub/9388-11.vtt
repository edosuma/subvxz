00:41.041 --> 00:44.587
- Stewie, you ready to go home?
- About an hour ago. This party sucks.

00:44.754 --> 00:47.216
- What happened to your face?
- I'm a kitty cat.

00:47.382 --> 00:50.221
Stupid face painter's
apparently never heard of Darth Maul.

00:50.387 --> 00:52.557
This party's worse
than a Mexican funeral.

01:19.388 --> 01:22.892
Let's get out of here, Brian. That
birthday party Spider-Man is eyeing me.

01:23.101 --> 01:25.230
Hmm. Don't let me catch you.

01:25.397 --> 01:27.900
Because I'll just wrap you up
and eat you later.

01:30.279 --> 01:32.657
Wait a minute. Hang on a second.
Who's that?

01:35.953 --> 01:38.416
That's Jared's mom.
Her husband died in a wreck.

01:38.582 --> 01:39.876
Really?

01:40.043 --> 01:42.714
Wait, he was either wounded or killed.
I don't remember.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.009
Well, which is it?
I can work with either.

01:45.175 --> 01:47.804
No, he's dead, he's dead.
Just like the Pink Panther.

01:47.971 --> 01:49.515
What's wrong with him, doctor?

01:49.682 --> 01:52.019
Well, it seems his lungs
are completely filled...

01:52.184 --> 01:54.313
...with Owens Corning
fiberglass insulation.

01:54.480 --> 01:58.069
- What? Will he be okay?
- No, he won't be okay.

01:58.235 --> 02:03.035
One third of his body weight
is Owens Corning fiberglass insulation.

02:04.244 --> 02:05.538
Well, that's it.

02:05.705 --> 02:07.875
But don't worry,
he won't burn in hell...

02:08.042 --> 02:11.839
...thanks to all that Owens Corning
fiberglass insulation.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.178
- How about that magician, huh?
- Yeah, he's great.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.472
I love magicians.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.643
I don't know why,
but I've always found magic very sexy.

02:20.810 --> 02:22.228
- I'm a magician.
- You are?

02:22.395 --> 02:24.900
- How long have you been doing magic?
- Oh, long time.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.195
- I used to work with Doug Henning.
- Wow.

02:27.361 --> 02:28.988
Yeah. Wanna see my Doug Henning?

02:29.490 --> 02:33.245
Welcome to the wonderful world
of magic. Hope I don't get AIDS.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.333
Oh, God. That is so my humor.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.587
You know, my son's birthday party
is next weekend.

02:39.754 --> 02:41.715
Any chance I can hire you
to do your act?

02:41.882 --> 02:45.305
Absolutely. I think the magic's
starting to happen already.

02:46.723 --> 02:48.559
Brian, this is painful.

02:48.726 --> 02:52.689
It's like listening to those foreign guys
at the coffee shop, living in the U. S...

02:52.856 --> 02:54.777
...almost long enough
to sound American.

02:54.944 --> 02:58.240
Oh, man. What a good bunch
of partying at that discotheque.

02:58.406 --> 03:00.284
They played
one of my audience requests.

03:00.451 --> 03:03.664
Way awesome.
I myself drank like 5 liters of beer.

03:03.831 --> 03:06.418
Any more and I would've ended up
in hospital, man.

03:06.585 --> 03:07.754
Oh, you said it, friend.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.883
But I wanted to stay,
because I almost had sex on this girl.

03:11.050 --> 03:16.015
Oh, yeah, but it was so expensive.
Each drink was like six dollars forty.

03:19.104 --> 03:23.317
And if I've done this right,
then this is your card, Stewie.

03:23.484 --> 03:27.156
Really, Brian? Card tricks? That's
gonna close the deal with this woman?

03:27.323 --> 03:29.618
- Well, yeah, why not?
- You need more than that.

03:29.785 --> 03:33.332
You need an act. I'll be your assistant
and we'll put on a whole big show.

03:33.499 --> 03:35.127
- Really?
- We'll do all the tricks.

03:35.294 --> 03:36.838
- You can split me in half.
- What?

03:37.005 --> 03:39.883
- Saw me in half.
- I am still shaky on some of this stuff.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.845
- I guess I could use the help.
- Great.

03:42.012 --> 03:44.056
We'll get you a wand,
a top hat and a cape.

03:44.223 --> 03:47.269
You can use Peter's cape
from last year's Halloween costume.

03:47.436 --> 03:51.066
Hi, Brian. I'm Count Crotchula,
the bulging vampire.

03:51.233 --> 03:54.572
I'll bite your neck, but also,
look how big I am down there.

03:54.739 --> 03:58.160
- The costume doesn't make any sense.
- Don't stifle my creativity.

03:58.327 --> 04:02.250
See that bulge down there, Brian?
What is that? What is it?

04:02.416 --> 04:05.546
Can't be my pointy teeth
because those are all the way up here.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.341
I'll let you in on a little secret.

04:08.508 --> 04:10.637
Happy Halloween.

04:13.808 --> 04:15.769
Okay, kids,
it's time for the magic show.

04:15.935 --> 04:20.108
How about a big round of applause
for The Amazing Brian?

04:22.320 --> 04:24.991
I can't believe I agreed
to four costume changes.

04:25.158 --> 04:28.120
Oh, who am I kidding? I insisted on it.

04:28.287 --> 04:30.082
Brian, thanks so much for doing this.

04:30.248 --> 04:32.543
Paul and I are so excited
to see your act.

04:32.710 --> 04:35.632
- Oh, thank... Wait, what?
- Paul, my boyfriend.

04:35.799 --> 04:38.718
- Paul, this is Brian.
- Boyfrie... Oh, come on.

04:38.886 --> 04:41.932
I paid $800 for all this crap.
You have a boyfriend?

04:42.100 --> 04:44.227
- Yeah.
- And I'm a great guy. I'm unemployed.

04:44.394 --> 04:47.148
- But that makes her feel useful.
- I'm gonna fix him.

04:47.315 --> 04:49.402
Our relationship will do fine
on that basis.

04:49.568 --> 04:52.030
If he had his shit together,
I wouldn't be into it.

04:52.197 --> 04:54.785
- But I don't.
- God, I am so sick of this crap.

04:54.952 --> 04:56.327
Is this the show?

04:56.495 --> 04:59.457
You know what? The hell with
both of you. I'm out of here.

04:59.625 --> 05:03.713
Are we doing this thing or what?
Brian? Brian?

05:03.880 --> 05:05.967
Well, this was a lot of effort
for nothing.

05:06.135 --> 05:09.222
Like trying to tell Matthew McConaughey
how much he sucks.

05:09.389 --> 05:12.602
You know, Matthew, I may not ever get
another chance to say this...

05:12.769 --> 05:15.313
...so I just wanna
get this off my chest.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.983
You are just awful.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.530
You're one of the worst actors
in the history of film.

05:20.697 --> 05:22.700
And I think that you need to go away.

05:22.867 --> 05:26.454
Oh, thanks, man. The truth is,
I spend at least 90 percent of my year...

05:26.621 --> 05:30.086
...going away, exploring exotic places,
having sex with my girlfriend...

05:30.253 --> 05:32.714
...just doing sit-ups.
And then counting money.

05:32.881 --> 05:36.052
Money from terrible films I put out
into the American populace...

05:36.219 --> 05:39.265
...because they just love to see me
doing what it is that I do.

05:39.432 --> 05:40.475
You're not hearing me.

05:40.642 --> 05:43.938
<i>Dazed and Confused was the one thing
that was passable. After that...</i>

05:44.105 --> 05:46.067
Oh, thanks, man.
That launched my career.

05:46.234 --> 05:48.279
After that, everything else was awful.

05:48.446 --> 05:50.531
<i>Contact, they didn't need you
in that movie.</i>

05:50.698 --> 05:53.369
- Could've done the movie without you.
- I said the same thing.

05:53.536 --> 05:57.250
They were like, " We need a good-looking
guy with a great ass and tight abs...

05:57.417 --> 06:00.129
...to provide some down-home
enthusiasm in this picture. "

06:00.296 --> 06:01.839
To counterbalance Jodie Foster.

06:02.007 --> 06:06.263
They took her to be, uh, slightly cold,
unapproachable, so they put me in there.

06:06.430 --> 06:07.514
It didn't make sense.

06:07.681 --> 06:10.561
Said the same thing
about that Bill Murray elephant movie...

06:10.728 --> 06:13.482
...but they were just like,
"Oh, the audiences need you. " Heh, heh.

06:13.649 --> 06:15.652
You make me physically sick
to my stomach.

06:15.818 --> 06:17.571
I wish you would get a heart attack.

06:17.738 --> 06:20.116
I totally feel you, man.
Truth of the matter is...

06:20.283 --> 06:23.705
...I don't like my movies either,
but they just keep offering me money.

06:23.872 --> 06:27.543
<i>I do it, I get to go around the world.
I mean, did you see Sahara? Ha, ha.</i>

06:27.711 --> 06:31.383
That movie gave me an opportunity to
take an Airstream across the country...

06:31.549 --> 06:33.719
...and sell that picture
one person at a time.

06:33.886 --> 06:36.640
- You suck donkey ass.
- Hey, you can't prove that.

06:39.478 --> 06:41.064
That was so humiliating.

06:41.231 --> 06:44.235
Look at all the stuff I put myself through
just to get laid.

06:44.402 --> 06:47.031
Oh, don't worry.
One day, you'll find your soul mate.

06:47.198 --> 06:50.119
The sad thing is, I already did,
years ago.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.621
Tracy Flannigan.

06:51.788 --> 06:54.624
She was the greatest girl I ever met,
and I blew it.

06:54.791 --> 06:55.918
You should look her up.

06:56.085 --> 06:58.881
- Am I boring you?
- No, it's just... Long day.

06:59.048 --> 07:02.553
Well, I suppose I could look her up.
I wonder if she'd even wanna see me.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.057
I wasn't exactly the nicest guy
in the world.

07:05.224 --> 07:09.397
And then in high school,
I was violated sexually by my father.

07:09.564 --> 07:12.693
It happened on numerous occasions.
I was afraid to tell anyone...

07:12.860 --> 07:16.907
...because I felt like somehow
it was my fault.

07:17.074 --> 07:20.663
So you do go all the way.

07:26.421 --> 07:28.174
Well, here goes.

07:34.349 --> 07:38.063
Uh, Tracy? Tracy Flannigan?

07:38.230 --> 07:41.485
Oh, my God. Brian Griffin, is that you?

07:41.651 --> 07:44.155
Uh, yeah. It's me.

07:44.322 --> 07:47.660
And all he wants is to kiss you
just one more time.

07:47.827 --> 07:51.458
Wow, you sure look different
than the last time I saw you.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.002
Yeah. Haircut.

07:53.169 --> 07:56.256
So to get out of here,
I just make a left out of the driveway...

07:56.423 --> 07:58.886
...and drive as fast as I can?
- Wait, Brian.

07:59.053 --> 08:01.555
I'm actually glad you found me.

08:01.722 --> 08:04.435
There's someone I've wanted you
to meet for a long time.

08:04.602 --> 08:08.398
From the look of those toenails,
I bet it's that little Lamasil monster.

08:08.566 --> 08:10.569
Brian, this is Dylan.

08:10.736 --> 08:13.239
He's your son.

08:13.406 --> 08:14.658
Oh, no way.

08:14.824 --> 08:17.370
<i>Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.</i>

08:22.753 --> 08:25.715
Gosh, this is a lovely home, Tracy.

08:25.882 --> 08:30.013
That's so weird. It smells like
there's a cat, but I bet there's no cat.

08:30.180 --> 08:33.018
I've wanted you to meet Dylan
for a long time, Brian.

08:33.184 --> 08:35.981
Well, Brian, a son. How about that?

08:36.147 --> 08:39.611
<i>My God, this is more uncomfortable
than the goodbye in The Wizard of Oz.</i>

08:39.778 --> 08:42.948
- Goodbye, Tin Man.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.

08:43.116 --> 08:45.495
- Goodbye, Lion.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.

08:45.662 --> 08:48.541
And I think I'll miss you most of all,
Scarecrow.

08:48.708 --> 08:50.877
Oh, okay.
That's kind of an odd thing to say.

08:51.044 --> 08:53.298
Yeah, a weird comment
in front of all of us.

08:53.464 --> 08:55.718
- Kind of thought this was a team effort.
- Yeah.

08:55.884 --> 08:58.139
Really glad I risked my life
and everything.

08:58.306 --> 09:01.351
Yeah, you're five minutes from gone,
and you leave with that?

09:01.518 --> 09:04.396
It's like cutting a huge fart
then walking out of the room.

09:04.564 --> 09:07.526
And that's how we'll remember you,
as a big fart.

09:07.694 --> 09:09.655
Goodbye, big fart.

09:12.701 --> 09:14.662
So, Dylan, um...

09:14.829 --> 09:16.873
- Shouldn't you be in school?
- I don't know.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.584
- It's Wednesday.
- Up yours.

09:18.751 --> 09:20.755
Nice kid. Now that I think about it...

09:20.921 --> 09:23.299
...how can you possibly have
a 13-year-old son...

09:23.466 --> 09:25.010
...when you yourself are only 7.

09:25.177 --> 09:27.639
- Those are dog years.
- That doesn't make any sense.

09:27.806 --> 09:31.352
You know what? If you don't like it,
go on the Internet and complain.

09:34.065 --> 09:36.443
Oh, it was awful.
That kid was a complete thug.

09:36.611 --> 09:38.489
I couldn't get out of there
fast enough.

09:38.655 --> 09:41.326
Boy, you dodged a bullet,
not having to raise that kid.

09:41.493 --> 09:44.080
Your life would've been more miserable
than a widow...

09:44.246 --> 09:45.998
...living in a downstairs apartment.

09:47.794 --> 09:50.756
- Achoo.
- Quiet. Keep it down up there.

09:52.132 --> 09:54.804
What did I just say?
I'm calling the police.

09:54.970 --> 09:58.683
I don't know, Brian. Don't you think
you have a responsibility to your son?

09:58.850 --> 10:01.563
Hey, Lois. I didn't even know
I had a son until today.

10:01.730 --> 10:04.359
Besides, it's not like Tracy
ever asked for my help.

10:04.526 --> 10:06.195
Yeah, seemed like they're all set.

10:06.362 --> 10:12.329
She's done a fine job
creating a child-friendly environment...

10:16.376 --> 10:17.586
Great parenting.

10:17.753 --> 10:21.050
I don't know, Brian. Raising a child
is a very rewarding experience.

10:21.217 --> 10:23.679
You know what else is rewarding?
Shutting your vag.

10:23.846 --> 10:24.889
- What?
- What?

10:27.017 --> 10:28.185
Dylan?

10:28.352 --> 10:31.315
- What are you doing here?
- My mom wanted me to give you this.

10:31.482 --> 10:35.404
"To Brian, from Tracy.
He's your problem now.

10:35.571 --> 10:38.075
P.S. Will you write me
a letter of recommendation...

10:38.242 --> 10:40.077
...for the University of Phoenix?"

10:40.244 --> 10:42.540
No. No, I'm not gonna put myself
on the line.

10:42.707 --> 10:43.959
But, Dylan, my God.

10:44.126 --> 10:47.547
Everybody, this handsome,
muscular boy is Brian's son, Dylan.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.884
Dylan is gonna be staying with us
for a while.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.928
Dylan, it's so nice to meet you.

10:52.095 --> 10:54.849
- Shut up, bitch.
- Oh, he got you, Lois.

10:55.017 --> 10:57.686
No, no. Tracy can't do this.
She can't leave him here.

10:57.853 --> 11:01.568
Well, we can't just turn him away, Brian.
After all, he is family.

11:01.735 --> 11:03.987
I don't know. Where's he gonna sleep?

11:04.154 --> 11:07.701
He could sleep in Stewie's room.
Would you like that, sweetie?

11:07.869 --> 11:10.872
No, my pants just got shorter
because I hated the idea.

11:13.460 --> 11:16.964
And this is Chris.
Chris, this is my son, Dylan.

11:17.131 --> 11:20.094
- Hi, Dylan.
- All this stuff in here is mine now.

11:20.261 --> 11:22.013
Oh, well...

11:22.181 --> 11:24.351
...okay, but be careful
opening the closet...

11:24.517 --> 11:26.686
...because that's where
the evil monkey lives.

11:33.614 --> 11:37.578
Yay! I haven't been in my closet
for years.

11:37.745 --> 11:41.041
Boy, there is a lot of feces in here.

11:46.341 --> 11:49.721
- Something on your mind, son?
- Shut up. You're just a fat, old bastard.

11:49.888 --> 11:53.434
Well, not to get technical, sir,
but you are the bastard.

12:09.791 --> 12:12.337
I hate you all. I didn't ask to be born.

12:12.504 --> 12:15.133
If I had a gun, I would kill you all.

12:15.299 --> 12:18.221
Did you hear that? Now we know
what to get him for Christmas.

12:18.388 --> 12:21.015
Oh, I love the holidays.

12:21.182 --> 12:23.603
Brian, you have got to get Dylan
under control.

12:23.770 --> 12:25.440
He's terrorizing the whole family.

12:25.605 --> 12:27.985
You wouldn't believe
what he did to Meg yesterday.

12:28.152 --> 12:31.489
He made her watch the other 178 hours
of Monty Python stuff...

12:31.656 --> 12:33.367
...that isn't funny or memorable.

12:33.534 --> 12:35.830
<i>I have a pet hedgehog named Zippy...</i>

12:35.997 --> 12:37.415
<i>...and I shall walk her to town.</i>

12:37.582 --> 12:42.631
<i>And each time my foot hits the ground,
I shall say, "Boing, boing, boing. "</i>

12:42.798 --> 12:46.928
I'm a girl. I don't even like
the good Monty Python sketches.

12:47.096 --> 12:49.099
Don't worry,
I got it under control, Lois.

12:49.265 --> 12:52.061
I'm monitoring Dylan from here
on Stewie's baby monitor.

12:52.228 --> 12:54.273
<i>Hey, Dylan?
Hey, come on in here for a sec.</i>

12:54.440 --> 12:56.066
<i>Stewie, why are you nude?</i>

12:56.233 --> 12:58.905
<i>Just a little something
I do once a week around here...</i>

12:59.071 --> 13:00.240
<i>...called a naked tea party.</i>

13:00.407 --> 13:04.204
<i>Got my teacup here.
Now all I need is a tea bag.</i>

13:04.370 --> 13:06.040
<i>That something that interests you?</i>

13:06.208 --> 13:08.293
<i>You're weird.
Yeah, and you're attractive.</i>

13:08.460 --> 13:11.798
<i>- Now take your fucking pants off.
I'm out of here.</i>

13:11.965 --> 13:13.467
<i>Did you see that, Rupert?</i>

13:13.634 --> 13:18.433
<i>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Seconds,
starring Stewie Griffin, huh?</i>

13:18.600 --> 13:20.728
<i>Gee whiz.</i>

13:24.651 --> 13:26.277
Lois, is the air conditioning on?

13:26.444 --> 13:28.530
I just woke up from a nap,
and I feel drafty.

13:28.698 --> 13:32.620
- Peter, we don't have air conditioning.
- Well, that's awful peculiar.

13:32.787 --> 13:34.915
Oh, my God. Peter, look.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.210
Oh, damn it, Dylan. What the hell?

13:37.377 --> 13:40.131
Well, thank God I'm full of Play-Doh.

13:45.180 --> 13:46.933
- There we are.
- That's it.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.145
I'm telling Brian he has to rein Dylan in
once and for all.

13:50.312 --> 13:51.648
Hey, where is Brian, anyway?

13:58.741 --> 14:01.996
Oh, thanks, Lois.
Dylan put this paper bag on my head...

14:02.162 --> 14:04.542
...and I could not figure out
how to get it off.

14:04.709 --> 14:06.128
That kid's a sociopath.

14:06.293 --> 14:08.171
It's time you lay down the law
with him.

14:08.338 --> 14:09.424
I couldn't agree more.

14:09.590 --> 14:13.763
I am gonna kick him out faster than
NASA kicked out the Cocoa Puffs bird.

14:15.599 --> 14:19.396
Okay, your physical exam was within
range. You aced the flight simulator.

14:19.563 --> 14:21.817
All that's left
is the psychological screening.

14:21.984 --> 14:24.319
- Okay.
- How do you feel about this?

14:24.486 --> 14:27.241
Ah. Oh, my God, Cocoa Puffs.
No, that's not me anymore.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.869
I'm just here to fly, sir.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.500
All right, you know what?
This isn't working out.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.463
I don't care I'm you father,
you don't care you're my son.

14:36.629 --> 14:40.218
We don't have anything in common.
It's best if you get out of this house.

14:40.385 --> 14:43.181
Fine. I hate it here anyhow.
Get out of my way.

14:44.433 --> 14:45.602
My pot.

14:45.769 --> 14:47.229
Your pot?

14:47.396 --> 14:51.067
And then in chapter 28 of my novel...

14:51.234 --> 14:54.071
...the other pilots finally trust
the Japanese pilot...

14:54.238 --> 14:57.368
...and let him into, um...

14:57.994 --> 14:59.038
...their group.

14:59.205 --> 15:01.373
Dude, that is an amazing story.

15:01.541 --> 15:05.379
Hey, hey,
what if, um, they were Korean pilots?

15:05.546 --> 15:07.299
I'm not really looking for notes...

15:07.466 --> 15:10.471
...but, you know, Dylan,
I gotta tell you something.

15:10.638 --> 15:13.099
I'm sorry I wasn't around
when you were growing up.

15:13.266 --> 15:15.436
Don't. Just don't...

15:15.603 --> 15:17.981
If I had known
having a son could be like this...

15:18.148 --> 15:19.275
How dare you?

15:19.442 --> 15:21.612
- I didn't know.
- You have no right. No right.

15:21.779 --> 15:24.032
- It wasn't my fault.
- You weren't there for me.

15:24.199 --> 15:26.118
Damn it,
don't you think I wanted to be?

15:29.790 --> 15:33.128
Shh. Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

15:33.295 --> 15:36.091
Look,
I know I wasn't there for you, man...

15:36.258 --> 15:39.429
...for all those years,
but that's gonna change.

15:39.596 --> 15:41.348
It's gonna be different from now on.

15:41.516 --> 15:45.272
I'm gonna make you into a better person,
starting first thing tomorrow.

15:45.438 --> 15:48.693
Just passing through.
See anything you like, speak up.

15:55.327 --> 15:56.663
Hey there, everybody.

15:56.830 --> 16:00.418
Was somebody looking for a son
with a bright new path to adulthood...

16:00.585 --> 16:02.922
...and his very, very proud dad?

16:03.089 --> 16:06.635
Oh, Dylan, you got a haircut.
Aren't you handsome?

16:06.802 --> 16:09.432
From now on,
I plan on being a real father to Dylan.

16:09.598 --> 16:12.060
And together,
we are gonna turn his life around.

16:12.227 --> 16:13.938
- Right, champ?
- You said it, Dad.

16:14.105 --> 16:17.568
- All right. You ready for school?
- Yeah. Hey, can I drive today?

16:17.735 --> 16:21.407
- Oh, this kid. He's only 13.
- I know. I was just kidding.

16:21.575 --> 16:27.458
Oh, we got a young Adam Sandler here,
I think, right?

16:27.624 --> 16:29.251
- Right?
- Yes.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.885
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

16:35.052 --> 16:38.223
All right, kids.
Have a good day at school.

16:38.807 --> 16:42.438
- Hey, Dylan. Have a great day at school.
- Thanks, Dad.

16:42.605 --> 16:44.775
- Hey, knock-knock.
- Who's there?

16:44.941 --> 16:48.112
- You're there.
- I'll always be there, Dylan.

16:48.279 --> 16:50.617
- Hey. Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

16:50.784 --> 16:52.827
- Danny Zuko.
- Oh, come on.

16:52.994 --> 16:55.123
The audition's not till 3.
Don't jinx it.

16:56.500 --> 17:00.047
You know, Brian, Dylan could have
just carpooled with me and the kids.

17:00.214 --> 17:04.301
Oh, Lois, uh, Dylan is
very special to me, and...

17:04.469 --> 17:07.140
Well, didn't you just get a ticket
for running a red light?

17:07.307 --> 17:10.019
Yeah, like six years ago.
And I got that ticket...

17:10.185 --> 17:12.857
...because I got distracted because
you were leaning out the window...

17:13.023 --> 17:16.820
...barking at a cow.
- So you admit you ran the red light?

17:16.987 --> 17:19.407
- Fuck you.
- Whoa, not the kind of language...

17:19.575 --> 17:23.122
...I want Dylan exposed to. Have fun
with your dead kids, reckless driver.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.178
<i>Crudely painted,
not-so-funny plywood cutout folk art.</i>

17:33.345 --> 17:35.598
<i>Crudely painted,
not-so-funny plywood cutout folk art.</i>

17:35.765 --> 17:38.311
<i>Crudely painted,
not-so-funny plywood cutout folk art.</i>

17:38.478 --> 17:41.774
I'm Al Harrington of Al Harrington's
Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing...

17:41.941 --> 17:43.443
...Tube Man Warehouse
and Emporium.

17:43.610 --> 17:47.240
As a result of a lawsuit, I am now
in possession of hundreds of pallets...

17:47.407 --> 17:50.036
...of crudely painted,
not-so-funny plywood cutout folk art.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.374
And it's just waiting to transform
your uncut trash-strewn lawn...

17:53.541 --> 17:55.711
...into a living canvas
that tells passers-by:

17:55.879 --> 17:58.381
"Hey, everyone.
A real funny bugger lives here. "

17:58.548 --> 18:01.553
Your neighbors will chuckle warmly.
Motorists will slow down...

18:01.720 --> 18:05.433
...when they cast their eyes on such
favorites as: Ben & Jerry's-looking cow.

18:05.601 --> 18:08.814
Black-silhouetted cowboy leaning
on barn. And everybody's favorite:

18:08.980 --> 18:12.485
Fat woman tending to her garden
in big polka-dotted bloomers.

18:12.652 --> 18:16.324
Most of this stuff is priced to move,
and until it does, it's a fire hazard.

18:16.490 --> 18:19.037
So please come see me on Route 2
in Weekapaug.

18:19.203 --> 18:21.414
Look for the Sort of Ben & Jerry's cow
out front.

18:21.582 --> 18:24.669
We interrupt to bring you grim news
out of LaGuardia airport...

18:24.837 --> 18:28.008
...where a 767 has been forced
to make a crash landing.

18:28.175 --> 18:31.764
I tell you, now that I'm a parent,
I can't even watch stories like that.

18:31.931 --> 18:35.727
I just think, you know, " Oh, my God,
what if Dylan were on that plane?"

18:35.895 --> 18:38.231
What...? Oh, my God,
I don't know what I would do.

18:38.398 --> 18:41.402
- I don't know what I would do.
- I understand, that'd be tough.

18:41.569 --> 18:45.575
Oh, no. No, no, no, Quagmire, no.
No, you do not understand.

18:45.742 --> 18:49.998
Until you have a child...
Until you have a child...

18:50.165 --> 18:52.502
...you do not understand. Okay?

18:52.669 --> 18:54.755
- Jesus.
- It's been like this all week.

18:54.922 --> 18:58.302
Watch this. Hey, Brian. What would
you do if Dylan fell out a window?

18:58.469 --> 19:01.557
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I don't even wanna think about that.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.643
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, no.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.105
Brian, what would you do
if Dylan was in a fire?

19:06.271 --> 19:08.775
Oh, no. Oh, my God.
Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no.

19:08.942 --> 19:12.197
- Knock on wood, knock on wood.
- Look, Brian, there's a difference...

19:12.364 --> 19:14.701
...between being concerned
and being overprotective.

19:14.909 --> 19:19.458
Now, that's a dad talking.
That is a dad talking, Quagmire.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.546
You're right, you can't hold your kids
back. It's like I say:

19:22.713 --> 19:25.634
You have to give your kids
both roots and wings.

19:26.342 --> 19:29.431
Brian, I wanna punch you
in the dick right now.

19:32.226 --> 19:36.524
Oh, that's Dylan's ring.
Hey, bud, everything all right?

19:36.859 --> 19:38.402
Really?

19:38.569 --> 19:41.991
Well, how many library assistants
did they pick?

19:42.324 --> 19:44.243
One of four?

19:44.410 --> 19:45.787
<i>One of four.</i>

19:45.954 --> 19:47.331
Well, you know what?

19:48.709 --> 19:52.715
Extra, extra, read all about it.
Ice cream for Dylan tonight.

19:52.882 --> 19:55.427
Peter, your dog has given me diabetes.

19:56.178 --> 19:59.600
I'm telling you Joe, he's as annoying
as mosquitoes in the summertime.

20:00.058 --> 20:04.523
Can I come in there with you?
There's light in there.

20:04.690 --> 20:07.861
- No, go away.
- Can I please come in?

20:08.028 --> 20:12.702
- You have juice and I wanna sit in it.
- Shoo, get lost.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.373
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, Chris, close the door. There's a...

20:16.540 --> 20:20.504
Oh, it's much nicer in here.
I'm gonna float around for a while...

20:20.671 --> 20:24.677
...then stick my needle
in your shoulder fat while you sleep.

20:24.970 --> 20:28.600
I tell you, I wish that old hag of Brian's
had never told him he had a kid.

20:28.767 --> 20:30.728
Wait a minute,
maybe that's the answer.

20:30.895 --> 20:32.563
Get his mother to take him back.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.818
- How the hell am I supposed to do that?
- She's an idiot redneck.

20:35.986 --> 20:39.241
Tricking her should be easier
than escaping from Canadian Alcatraz.

20:40.075 --> 20:42.746
- Can I go out through here?
- Just be back by bedtime.

20:42.912 --> 20:44.665
Okay.

20:48.504 --> 20:50.590
Lunch is ready, everyone.

20:50.757 --> 20:54.304
- Whoa, Lois, Lois, this is white bread.
- Yeah, so?

20:54.471 --> 20:57.392
- Don't we have any whole-grain stuff?
- No, this was cheaper.

20:57.558 --> 21:00.313
I just... I just...
I don't want Dylan eating white bread.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.857
There's nothing wrong with it.
Our kids eat...

21:03.024 --> 21:05.904
Lois, Lois, I do not want Dylan
eating white bread.

21:06.071 --> 21:08.950
- Brian, I promise you, it's fine.
- Lois, Lois, Lois.

21:09.117 --> 21:12.831
- I will decide what is best for my child.
- Look, will you take it easy?

21:12.998 --> 21:16.878
And... And I do not wanna have
this conversation in front of my son.

21:17.045 --> 21:20.383
Okay, you know what? That's it, Brian.
Feed him whatever you want.

21:20.550 --> 21:23.680
Tell you what. Go up to my jewelry box,
take my gold jewelry.

21:23.847 --> 21:26.434
Melt it down, make it into bread
and feed him that.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.689
That good enough?
Gold bread good enough for your Dylan?

21:30.272 --> 21:33.903
Hey, everybody.
Look who's back to pick up her son.

21:34.070 --> 21:35.823
<i>This isn't The Price Is Right.</i>

21:35.990 --> 21:38.618
<i>You said we were going
to The Price Is Right.</i>

21:38.785 --> 21:41.539
- Peter, what the hell is this?
- What are you doing here?

21:41.707 --> 21:45.003
Tracy wants Dylan back.
Don't you want Dylan back, Tracy?

21:45.670 --> 21:49.008
What a joyous family reunion.
Isn't this great, Brian?

21:49.175 --> 21:53.098
Now Dylan can go back with his mom,
and you can stop acting like a jackass.

21:53.265 --> 21:54.892
So that's what this is all about.

21:55.059 --> 21:58.731
I must say, you have been
a little insufferable lately, Brian.

21:58.898 --> 22:01.067
We just want the old you back.
That's all.

22:01.234 --> 22:04.740
All right. Okay, maybe I have been
acting different lately, all right?

22:04.907 --> 22:07.159
But that's only
because I've truly connected...

22:07.327 --> 22:10.540
...with the one bit of flesh and blood
that I have on this earth.

22:10.707 --> 22:13.084
And I have no intention
of giving that up.

22:13.669 --> 22:17.008
- Who wants a half-and-half?
- I'll throw my hat into that ring.

22:17.175 --> 22:18.342
Wait a minute, Dad.

22:18.510 --> 22:22.307
- I think maybe I should go with her.
- What? Dylan, why?

22:22.474 --> 22:25.728
Look at her. She needs me.
A lot more than you do.

22:25.895 --> 22:28.691
But we were just starting
to make a real connection.

22:28.858 --> 22:32.279
Listen, I'll always be grateful to you
for turning my life around.

22:32.446 --> 22:33.907
But now thanks to you...

22:34.074 --> 22:36.744
...I finally have a chance
to transform my mom's life...

22:36.911 --> 22:38.956
...in the same way
you transformed mine.

22:39.582 --> 22:40.625
Wow.

22:40.793 --> 22:44.548
You know, I guess a dad
couldn't ask for more than that.

22:44.714 --> 22:46.425
I'm proud of you, Dylan.

22:46.592 --> 22:49.555
My life will never be the same
for knowing you.

22:49.721 --> 22:52.393
Goodbye, and good luck.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.603
Goodbye, Dad.

22:55.981 --> 22:58.610
Come on, Mom. Let's go.

22:59.068 --> 23:00.862
Bye. Thanks for coming.

23:04.660 --> 23:07.205
I'm gonna miss that boy.
