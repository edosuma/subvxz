SOMEBODY GOT PREGNANT,
SOMEBODY GOT ARRESTED,

00:14.166 --> 00:16.125

THANK YOU.

00:36.417 --> 00:38.834
I REALLY SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE GOING
ON THIS TRIP.

I SHOULD BE BACK
IN THE HOSPITAL WITH GRAMS.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.917
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE
ABOUT SEX.

10:01.917 --> 10:04.959
THIS WEEKEND DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE ABOUT SEX.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.875
Jen: WHAT IF IT
NEEDS TO BE AMPUTATED?

10:09.875 --> 10:12.750
YOU WANT TO GO FIND
A DOCTOR RIGHT NOW?

10:12.750 --> 10:15.291
NO, 'CAUSE IT'S
PROBABLY JUST BRUISED.

10:15.291 --> 10:16.583
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

10:16.583 --> 10:17.542
WHAT?

10:17.542 --> 10:18.583
I'M NOT GONNA LET THIS

10:18.583 --> 10:20.208
INTERFERE WITH
OUR VACATION IN ANY WAY,

10:20.208 --> 10:22.041
BECAUSE YOU AND I
ARE GONNA HAVE
SOME SERIOUS FUN,

10:22.041 --> 10:23.750
EVEN IF I HAVE TO
CARRY YOU AROUND
ON MY SHOULDERS

10:23.750 --> 10:25.458
FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS.
WELL,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.959
THE FUN'S GONNA START
WITH YOU TAKING OFF MY PANTS.

10:27.959 --> 10:31.125
I WANT TO TAKE A BATH
BEFORE DINNER. OW!

10:31.125 --> 10:33.875
ACTUALLY,
I CAN'T DO THAT.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.500
WHY?

10:35.500 --> 10:38.291
'CAUSE YOU'RE A GIRL
AND I'M A BOY,

10:38.291 --> 10:41.041
AND, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S, LIKE,
BOUNDARIES AND RULES.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.750
JACK, I HARDLY THINK
THEY'RE GONNA
KICK YOU OFF THE TEAM

10:42.750 --> 10:44.583
FOR HELPING ME
INTO THE TUB. PLEASE?

10:44.583 --> 10:45.792
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.792
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO STOP CLINGING

10:47.792 --> 10:51.083
TO THESE RIDICULOUS
MACHO CONVENTIONS

10:51.083 --> 10:52.792
ABOUT WHAT IS
AND IS NOT APPROPRIATE.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.333
OK, FINE.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.792
DON'T HELP.

10:58.792 --> 10:59.792
WHEN I ATTACH
MY WOODEN FOOT

10:59.792 --> 11:02.208
EVERY MORNING
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

11:02.208 --> 11:03.250
I'M GONNA REMEMBER THIS.

11:03.250 --> 11:04.750
YEAH. WELL, WHATEVER.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.667
WHOA! YO, THAT'S ENOUGH,
RIGHT THERE.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.500
WHAT?

11:09.500 --> 11:12.083
WOULD YOU WANT ME
TAKING MY CLOTHES OFF
IN FRONT OF YOU?

11:13.291 --> 11:16.083
OK, THAT'S WITHDRAWN.

11:17.917 --> 11:19.458
OOH!

11:23.917 --> 11:25.291
HUNGRY?

11:25.667 --> 11:27.500
OH, HEY.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.792
UH, YEAH.

11:28.792 --> 11:32.166
I'M JUST--
I'M KIND OF BUSY,
ACTUALLY.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.667
WELL, YOU GOTTA EAT
SOMETIME, RIGHT?

11:34.667 --> 11:35.834
UH, YEAH.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.583
I'M LOOKING
FOR SOME CLIPS

11:37.583 --> 11:39.708
TO ADD TO
THE FINAL SEQUENCE.

11:39.708 --> 11:42.667
YOU'VE BEEN
OVER THAT MOVIE
AT LEAST A THOUSAND TIMES.

11:42.667 --> 11:43.917
COME ON, DAWSON.

11:43.917 --> 11:46.166
YOU'VE GOT A LOT
GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD
RIGHT NOW.

11:46.166 --> 11:49.375
I THINK SOME CHEESE
AND CRACKERS MIGHT HELP.

11:51.708 --> 11:54.000
OK.

11:55.708 --> 11:57.917
PLEASE TELL ME
THAT YOU ONLY BROUGHT
ONE KIND OF CRACKER,

11:57.917 --> 11:58.708
'CAUSE I HONESTLY
DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE

11:58.708 --> 12:01.667
ANY MORE DECISIONS
RIGHT NOW.

12:02.291 --> 12:06.208
[GROANS]

12:06.208 --> 12:08.917
HOW DID I END UP HERE?

12:08.917 --> 12:10.917
I MEAN, ONE MINUTE,
I'M PAINTING
THE GUY'S FENCE,

12:10.917 --> 12:12.792
THE NEXT...

12:12.792 --> 12:14.208
[SIGHS]

12:14.208 --> 12:15.375
YOU KNOW,
I'M 17 YEARS OLD.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.542
I SHOULD BE
ON MY SENIOR CLASS TRIP
RIGHT NOW,

12:17.542 --> 12:19.458
MAKING DECISIONS LIKE
GLASSES OR GOGGLES.

12:19.458 --> 12:21.500
WHO DO I ROOM WITH?

12:21.500 --> 12:22.917
IS IT SAFE
TO SKI WITH A HANGOVER?

12:22.917 --> 12:24.291
WELL, IT'S NEVER VERY NICE.

12:24.291 --> 12:25.250
[SIGHS]

12:25.250 --> 12:27.375
WHAT'S THAT?

12:27.375 --> 12:30.041
WHEN ADULTHOOD
ENCROACHES ON YOUR LIFE.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.750
I WISH I COULD
APPRECIATE THIS

12:33.750 --> 12:35.875
ON SOME SORT OF
PHILOSOPHICAL LEVEL
RIGHT NOW.

12:35.875 --> 12:38.333
I KNOW, BUT NOBODY
EXPECTS YOU TO.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.917
WHO WAS
THE FIRST FAMILY MEMBER
THAT YOU KNEW WHO DIED?

12:42.917 --> 12:46.417
MY GRANDPA.

12:46.417 --> 12:51.583
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY
THE SWEETEST
AND FUNNIEST MAN ALIVE,

12:51.583 --> 12:55.125
AND HE PASSED AWAY
ON MY EIGHTH BIRTHDAY.

12:55.125 --> 12:57.500
YOU?

12:57.500 --> 12:59.417
MY GRANDFATHER
DIED WHEN I WAS 2,

12:59.417 --> 13:01.667
BUT I'VE NEVER LOST
A FAMILY MEMBER
I WAS CLOSE TO...

13:03.000 --> 13:05.083
AND THAT'S WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.125
I'VE HAD SO LITTLE
EXPERIENCE WITH DEATH.

13:07.125 --> 13:09.125
HOW COULD BROOKS
HAVE BEEN SO SURE

13:09.125 --> 13:11.041
THAT I WOULD DO
WHAT HE WANTED?

13:11.041 --> 13:15.000
YOU HAVE BETTER JUDGMENT
THAN ANYONE I KNOW, DAWSON--

13:15.000 --> 13:16.750
PROBABLY BETTER THAN
ANYBODY THAT BROOKS KNEW,

13:16.750 --> 13:20.583
AND THAT'S WHY HE CHOSE YOU.

13:20.583 --> 13:22.125
I DON'T THINK
HE SAW HOW YOUNG YOU WERE

13:22.125 --> 13:26.708
AND FIGURED THAT YOU
WOULD BE MORE LIKELY
TO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS END.

13:26.708 --> 13:29.500
I THINK HE SAW
HOW OLD YOUR HEART IS,

13:29.500 --> 13:33.000
AND HE KNEW THAT
WHATEVER CHOICE YOU MADE,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.166
IT WOULD BE THE RIGHT ONE.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.542
THIS LOOKS
KIND OF QUAINT.

13:49.542 --> 13:51.583
MAKE WAY FOR THE CRIPPLE.

13:51.583 --> 13:54.125
IT'S JUST A BRUISE.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.667
YOU GUYS GOING TO GRECCO'S?

13:55.667 --> 13:56.875
IT'S A PIZZA PLACE.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.917
SUPPOSE TO BE
RIGHT UP THE STREET HERE,
ACTUALLY.

13:58.917 --> 14:00.458
RED-CHECKERED TABLECLOTHS,
HIGH SCHOOL PRICES.

14:00.458 --> 14:02.792
SOUNDS FUN.

14:02.792 --> 14:03.834
YOU SURE
YOU'RE OK?

14:03.834 --> 14:05.708
YEAH, I'M FINE.

14:05.708 --> 14:09.000
I'M JUST GONNA PUT
MY BEST FOOT FORWARD.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.250
AFTER YOU.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.625
THANK YOU.

14:14.667 --> 14:15.834
OH!

14:15.834 --> 14:17.375
SO, THEN I WAS LIKE,

14:17.375 --> 14:22.041
"NO WAY! THAT IS
SO NOT POSSIBLE
IN A DODGE NEON."

14:22.041 --> 14:24.000
OH, WHAT'S
THE MATTER, POTTER?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
NO PERSONAL EXPERIENCES
TO CONTRIBUTE

14:26.000 --> 14:28.166
ON THE
GIRLS-JUST-WANNA-HAVE-FUN
FRONT?

14:28.166 --> 14:29.250
THE AMOUNT
OF SEXUAL PLEASURE

14:29.250 --> 14:30.041
THE AVERAGE
TEENAGE GIRL GETS

14:30.041 --> 14:30.917
FROM THE AVERAGE
TEENAGE GUY

14:30.917 --> 14:34.083
IN SOME RANDOM
KEG PARTY HOOK-UP

14:34.083 --> 14:35.917
IS NEGLIGIBLE
AT BEST.

14:35.917 --> 14:39.708
UNLESS YOU'RE DOING IT
WITH A MAN WHO KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.125
Drue:
SEE? I REST MY CASE.

14:41.125 --> 14:44.834
GIRLS HAVE IT WAY EASIER
THAN GUYS DO, RIGHT?

14:44.834 --> 14:47.166
THERE'S
NO PERFORMANCE ANXIETY,

14:47.166 --> 14:47.959
AND ONCE
THEY DECIDE TO DO IT,

14:47.959 --> 14:49.667
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO
IS ASK.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.458
THEY SHOULD BE THE ONES
CARRYING THE CONDOMS
AROUND IN THEIR WALLETS.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.125
[GUYS CHEER]

14:55.125 --> 14:56.625
THANK YOU.

14:56.625 --> 14:59.417
NOT EVERY GUY WALKS
AROUND WITH A CONDOM
IN HIS WALLET, DRUE.

14:59.417 --> 15:01.917
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

15:01.917 --> 15:05.291
GUYS, LET'S GO. WALLET.

15:11.959 --> 15:14.458
PACEY,
I DON'T SEE YOUR WALLET.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.708
I FORGOT IT
BACK AT THE LODGE.

15:24.542 --> 15:26.417
HEY, PACE,

15:26.417 --> 15:29.417
WHY DIDN'T YOU WANT TO
SHOW YOUR WALLET IN THERE?

15:29.417 --> 15:30.917
I TOLD YOU,
IT'S BACK AT THE LODGE.

15:30.917 --> 15:32.917
IT'S IN YOUR POCKET.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.125
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

16:29.125 --> 16:32.500
THAT'S AS GOOD
A REASON AS ANY.

16:33.542 --> 16:34.417
DID YOU COME HERE
TO PRAY?

16:34.417 --> 16:37.333
OH, YES,

16:37.333 --> 16:40.166
AND ALSO FOR THE QUIET.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.500
WHAT DO YOU PRAY FOR,
WHEN YOU DO?

16:43.500 --> 16:47.375
IT DEPENDS.

16:47.375 --> 16:51.750
I PRAY FOR THOSE WHO I LOVE,

16:51.750 --> 16:55.125
FOR THOSE
WHO ARE NO LONGER WITH ME.

16:55.125 --> 16:58.417
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

17:01.208 --> 17:02.959
I DON'T KNOW.

17:02.959 --> 17:05.290
I HAVEN'T DONE IT
SINCE I WAS A KID,

17:05.290 --> 17:09.666
AND THEN IT WAS,
YOU KNOW,
MORE OF A WISH,

17:09.666 --> 17:12.250
SOMETHING I WANTED
BUT COULDN'T
SAY OUT LOUD.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.834
IF YOU COULD
SAY IT OUT LOUD,

17:16.834 --> 17:19.250
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.708
THAT'S THE THING.
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:26.708 --> 17:30.083
I MEAN...

17:32.208 --> 17:34.208
DO I PRAY FOR HIM
TO MAKE IT,

17:34.208 --> 17:35.708
TO SIT UP IN HIS BED

17:35.708 --> 17:37.041
AND TELL US THAT
WE'VE ALL BEEN HERE
LONG ENOUGH

17:37.041 --> 17:39.000
AND IT'S TIME
TO GO HOME,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.959
OR DO I PRAY
FOR HIM TO DIE,

17:41.959 --> 17:44.333
TO EASE
HIS SUFFERING?

17:46.083 --> 17:52.166
AND I KEEP LOOKING
FOR SOME KIND OF SIGN.

17:52.166 --> 17:53.708
YOU KNOW,

17:53.708 --> 17:57.083
SOMETHING
TO CONFIRM MY INSTINCTS.

17:57.083 --> 18:01.333
WHAT DO YOUR INSTINCTS
TELL YOU?

18:08.000 --> 18:10.667
TO KEEP WAITING.

18:13.750 --> 18:17.041
THEN THAT'S WHAT
WE'LL DO...

18:17.041 --> 18:19.166
TOGETHER.

18:28.333 --> 18:29.917
IT IS JUST ME,

18:29.917 --> 18:33.166
OR DOES THIS PLACE HAVE
A REAL STRONG JOHN HUGHES
EIGHTIES VIBE?

18:33.166 --> 18:35.667
YOU MEAN
THE SLIGHTLY TACKY QUALITY?

18:35.667 --> 18:38.625
SORT OF.

18:38.625 --> 18:41.834
NO. I MEAN THAT
AUTHENTIC AMERICANA
YOUTH STUFF.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.792
YOU KNOW,
ICE SKATING,
MINI GOLF, ARCADES.

18:43.792 --> 18:46.792
NOSTALGIA
FOR A TIME WE NEVER
REALLY EXPERIENCED.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.417
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:50.417 --> 18:51.417
I'M SORRY.

18:51.417 --> 18:52.125
I JUST--

18:52.125 --> 18:56.041
I GUESS I'M JUST IN A FUNK.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.792
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

18:57.792 --> 18:59.667
SEX.

18:59.667 --> 19:02.125
SEX IS MY PROBLEM.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.792
SEX IS ALWAYS MY PROBLEM.

19:04.792 --> 19:07.125
I HAVE SO MUCH CONVICTION
ABOUT WAITING
UNTIL THE RIGHT MOMENT,

19:07.125 --> 19:11.792
NOT FEELING GUILTY
OR OBLIGATED,

19:11.792 --> 19:14.792
AND I DON'T.

19:14.792 --> 19:17.291
HAS IT EVER
OCCURRED TO YOU

19:17.291 --> 19:18.708
THAT YOU MIGHT BE
SO CAUGHT UP

19:18.708 --> 19:21.583
IN TRYING TO FIND
THE RIGHT CHOICE

19:21.583 --> 19:24.625
THAT YOU NEVER REALLY
STOPPED TO THINK
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY

19:24.625 --> 19:25.959
THAT THERE MAY NOT
BE A RIGHT CHOICE
OR A WRONG CHOICE,

19:25.959 --> 19:27.333
JUST A BUNCH
OF CHOICES?

19:30.417 --> 19:32.166
YOU'RE A REAL HELP.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.333
YOU DON'T NEED HELP.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.166
THERE'S NOTHING
TO FIGURE OUT HERE.

19:37.166 --> 19:39.166
IT'S ONLY
WHAT YOU FEEL.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.667
WELL, I FEEL FEAR.

19:41.667 --> 19:44.500
WELL...

19:44.500 --> 19:47.500
THE ONLY REALLY EXCITING
THINGS IN LIFE

19:47.500 --> 19:49.333
REQUIRE MORE COURAGE
THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE.

19:49.333 --> 19:52.834
YOU KNOW,
DEEP BREATH AND A LEAP.

19:52.834 --> 19:55.417
THAT KIND OF FEAR THAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT...

19:57.667 --> 20:01.417
SOMETIMES,
IT'S HOW YOU KNOW
WHAT'S WORTHWHILE.

20:14.083 --> 20:16.041
WELL...

20:16.041 --> 20:20.208
YOU WON, YOU OLD BASTARD.

20:20.208 --> 20:23.166
YOU GET TO SEE HER FIRST.

20:27.458 --> 20:28.750
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU, KID?

20:28.750 --> 20:30.250
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.708
YOU'RE--

20:31.708 --> 20:34.583
OH, NOT MANY PEOPLE
REMEMBER THOSE OLD PICTURES,

20:34.583 --> 20:36.542
ESPECIALLY NOT YOUNG PEOPLE.

20:36.542 --> 20:38.875
YOU MUST BE
ARTHUR'S GRANDSON.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.583
THE DOCTOR SAID--
I--I'M--

20:40.583 --> 20:41.625
I'M NOT HIS GRANDSON,
ACTUALLY.

20:41.625 --> 20:45.750
I'M, UH, I'M JUST A FAN.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.333
Man: OH.

20:47.333 --> 20:50.542
HE SAID HE HADN'T
SPOKEN TO YOU IN--

20:50.542 --> 20:52.000
Man: 40 YEARS.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.583
HE WROTE ME LAST MONTH,

20:53.583 --> 20:55.417
SAID HE'D BEEN A FOOL,

20:55.417 --> 20:57.250
ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.000
FORGIVE HIM FOR WHAT?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.625
THE ONLY PERSON
HE EVER HURT WAS HIMSELF.

21:03.750 --> 21:07.333
I THOUGHT ABOUT CALLING
AFTER SHE PASSED AWAY--

21:07.333 --> 21:10.000
MY WIFE ELLIE.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.875
I FIGURED
HE'D BE THE ONLY ONE
WHO WOULD UNDERSTAND.

21:12.875 --> 21:16.458
WHAT STOPPED YOU?

21:16.458 --> 21:19.458
OH, I REALIZED

21:19.458 --> 21:23.667
HOW MUCH GREATER
HIS HURT WOULD BE THAN MINE,

21:23.667 --> 21:26.917
HOW MANY OCEANS BIGGER.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.875
ALL THE YEARS
I HAD WITH ELLIE--

21:28.875 --> 21:31.917
3 CHILDREN, A HOME,
A GOOD LIFE.

21:31.917 --> 21:35.291
STILL, ALL THAT TIME,

21:35.291 --> 21:38.458
HE HAD
THAT PART OF HER SOUL

21:38.458 --> 21:41.500
YOU GIVE YOUR FIRST LOVE.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.208
WHEN HE GOES,
HE'LL BE WITH HER.

21:45.208 --> 21:48.625
I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WAY
IT SHOULD HAVE ALWAYS BEEN.

21:49.834 --> 21:52.959
WELL...

21:52.959 --> 21:55.792
GOOD-BYE, ARTHUR.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.083
THANKS FOR WRITING

21:58.083 --> 22:01.542
AND FOR STAYING
TILL I COULD SAY GOOD-BYE.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.917
WAIT A MINUTE.

22:05.917 --> 22:06.750
PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE.

22:06.750 --> 22:07.458
I...

22:07.458 --> 22:09.792
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

22:09.792 --> 22:13.166
I'M NOT QUALIFIED
TO DECIDE WHEN
A MAN SHOULD DIE.

22:13.166 --> 22:18.041
IN A SITUATION
LIKE THIS, SON,

22:18.041 --> 22:21.875
ALL THAT'S REQUIRED
IS A LITTLE FAITH.

22:21.875 --> 22:23.875
I DON'T HAVE THAT.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.000
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.500
FAITH IS
BELIEVING IN SOMETHING

22:27.500 --> 22:31.208
WHEN COMMON SENSE
TELLS YOU NOT TO.

22:31.208 --> 22:33.667
MIRACLE ON 34th STREET.

22:33.667 --> 22:37.291
ARTHUR ALWAYS BELIEVED

22:37.291 --> 22:39.333
THAT THE BEST ANSWERS
FOR LIFE'S QUESTIONS

22:39.333 --> 22:43.333
COULD BE FOUND IN THE MOVIES.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.917
CRAZY IDEA, HUH?

22:44.917 --> 22:47.417
NOT SO CRAZY.

22:47.417 --> 22:49.375
A KINDRED SPIRIT.

23:02.875 --> 23:05.000
[LAUGHS]

23:05.000 --> 23:06.291
FORGIVE ME.

23:06.291 --> 23:07.875
I WAS IN
ALL KINDS OF DISCOMFORT,

23:07.875 --> 23:11.667
AND IN LIEU OF SEDATIVES
AND PAINKILLERS,

23:11.667 --> 23:15.708
I SOUGHT REFUGE
IN THE NEXT BEST MEDICINE.

23:15.708 --> 23:17.834
HOW'D YOU GET
THE MINI-BAR OPEN?

23:17.834 --> 23:18.708
[GIGGLES]

23:18.708 --> 23:21.291
YOU'D BE AMAZED
WHAT A GIRL CAN DO

23:21.291 --> 23:23.208
WITH A HAIR CLIP
AND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

23:23.208 --> 23:24.250
[CHUCKLES]

23:24.250 --> 23:25.834
I WISH YOU COULD SEE
HOW PATHETIC THIS LOOKS.

23:25.834 --> 23:29.125
[SIGHS]

23:29.125 --> 23:30.041
TIRED?

23:30.041 --> 23:31.834
NO. ACTUALLY,
I'M VERY, VERY AWAKE.

23:31.834 --> 23:35.333
ME, TOO.

23:35.333 --> 23:38.125
TELL YOU WHAT
I AM TIRED OF, THOUGH.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.250
I'M TIRED
OF FEELING SO NUMBED.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.542
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS
PLAY EVERYTHING SO SAFE
AND HARMLESS.

23:42.542 --> 23:44.083
I WANT TO BE DANGEROUS,
YOU KNOW?

23:44.083 --> 23:47.083
I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING RECKLESS
AND STUPID TONIGHT.

23:47.083 --> 23:49.417
LIKE WHAT?

23:49.417 --> 23:51.125
I DON'T KNOW.

23:51.125 --> 23:55.083
GET WASTED,
GET IN A FIGHT,
SOMETHING.

23:55.083 --> 23:58.583
TELL YOU WHAT.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.166
HAVE A DRINK WITH ME NOW,

24:00.166 --> 24:01.083
AND I'LL FIGHT YOU LATER.

24:01.083 --> 24:03.834
SOUNDS GOOD.

24:03.834 --> 24:08.125
SO, YOU'RE THE EXPERT
ON WILD ABANDON
AND RISKY BUSINESS?

24:08.125 --> 24:12.083
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU REALLY WANT TO DO?

24:12.083 --> 24:13.875
YES.

24:13.875 --> 24:15.792
WHAT IS IT?

24:15.792 --> 24:18.625
I WANT TO SIT HERE WITH YOU.

24:22.417 --> 24:25.333
SORRY.
HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.917
I JUST WANTED
TO REMIND YOU GUYS
ABOUT THE HOT TUBS.

24:27.917 --> 24:29.125
WE GET THE PICTURE.

24:29.125 --> 24:29.959
I JUST WASN'T SURE
IF IT WAS CLEAR.

24:29.959 --> 24:32.333
CRYSTAL.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.125
OK. WELL, SEE YA.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.125
NO COMMENT?

24:41.125 --> 24:43.417
NOT REALLY.

24:43.417 --> 24:48.083
REALLY? VIRTUALLY
TOPLESS FEMALE

24:48.083 --> 24:49.250
COMES KNOCKING
ON OUR DOOR,

24:49.250 --> 24:51.083
ASKING IF PACEY
CAN COME OUT TO PLAY,

24:51.083 --> 24:52.458
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY COMMENT?

24:52.458 --> 24:53.834
WELL,
NO MATTER WHAT I SAY,

24:53.834 --> 24:55.166
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA TAKE IT WRONG.

24:56.875 --> 25:01.083
OK. SO,
UH, KEEP ME POSTED

25:01.083 --> 25:02.500
SHOULD YOU
FORM ANY THOUGHTS

25:02.500 --> 25:04.166
THAT YOU'RE WILLING
TO PUT ON RECORD.

25:04.166 --> 25:08.125
Pacey: OH, GOD,
I SURE AM GLAD WE TABLED
THAT WHOLE SEX DISCUSSION.

25:08.125 --> 25:10.667
YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN
HAVING SUCH A RELAXING
WEEKEND SO FAR,

25:10.667 --> 25:13.375
I'D HATE TO RUIN IT
WITH A BUNCH OF PASSIVE-
AGGRESSIVE INSINUATIONS.

25:13.375 --> 25:16.875
I'M REALLY SORRY, PACE,
THAT ALL OF MY HANG-UPS
AND NEUROSES

25:16.875 --> 25:18.166
ARE PUTTING A CRIMP
IN YOUR SOCIAL LIFE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:18.166 --> 25:20.750
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO JOIN YOUR FRIEND
IN THE HOT TUB

25:20.750 --> 25:22.166
AND FEEL FREE--

25:22.166 --> 25:23.875
AND GIVE YOU SOMETHING
TO BE REALLY PISSED OFF
ABOUT, RIGHT?

25:23.875 --> 25:25.083
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
IS IT?

25:25.083 --> 25:27.000
NO. SHE'S WHAT YOU WANT,
ISN'T SHE?

25:27.000 --> 25:30.166
SOMEONE WHO'S
A LITTLE BIT MORE FUN?

25:30.166 --> 25:31.166
A LITTLE BIT
MORE EXPERIENCED?

25:31.166 --> 25:32.333
A LITTLE BIT MORE EAGER

25:32.333 --> 25:34.291
TO HELP TO MAKE THIS A
TRULY MEMORABLE WEEKEND?

25:34.291 --> 25:35.875
I WANT YOU, JO,

25:35.875 --> 25:38.750
BUT THERE'S NO SENSE
IN ME ARGUING THE POINT

25:38.750 --> 25:40.417
IF YOU'RE SO EAGER
TO REFUTE IT.

25:40.417 --> 25:43.166
LOOK, I DON'T--

25:43.166 --> 25:46.959
I DON'T DOUBT
THAT YOU WANT ME, PACEY.

25:46.959 --> 25:49.834
I JUST--

25:49.834 --> 25:51.583
I DON'T KNOW WHY
OR FOR WHAT REASON.

25:51.583 --> 25:54.041
OK. PLEASE,
JUST STOP RIGHT THERE.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.542
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

25:55.542 --> 25:57.583
THAT IF I WAS
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP
FOR SEX AND SEX ALONE,

25:57.583 --> 25:59.375
I WOULD NOT HAVE LASTED
FOR 9 MONTHS.

25:59.375 --> 26:02.333
NO. NO,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.542
LOOK, JO, I REFUSE
TO FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THIS,

26:04.542 --> 26:06.041
BECAUSE THE FACT
OF THE MATTER IS,

26:06.041 --> 26:07.708
IT'S NOT A BAD THING
WHEN YOU WANT TO SLEEP
WITH SOMEBODY

26:07.708 --> 26:08.917
WHEN YOU LOVE 'EM
AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU.

26:08.917 --> 26:12.792
BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH NOT WANTING TO.

26:12.792 --> 26:14.875
NO.

26:14.875 --> 26:17.125
NO.

26:17.125 --> 26:19.625
I JUST WISH I KNEW
WHAT THAT SOMETHING WAS.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.667
I MEAN,
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SCARED.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.458
I GET IT.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.333
YOU TELL ME THAT YOU
WANT TO BE SCARED TOGETHER,

26:25.333 --> 26:27.417
BUT THEN, YOU WON'T TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE SCARED OF,

26:27.417 --> 26:29.208
AND I THINK YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

26:29.208 --> 26:30.917
YOU'RE JUST TOO AFRAID
TO SAY HIS NAME.

26:30.917 --> 26:31.875
DAWSON?

26:34.458 --> 26:36.583
THAT IS NOT FAIR, PACEY.

26:36.583 --> 26:37.667
YOU CAN'T
BRING HIS NAME UP

26:37.667 --> 26:38.667
EVERY SINGLE TIME
OUR RELATIONSHIP--

26:38.667 --> 26:41.291
OK. FINE, FINE,
FINE, FINE, FINE.

26:41.291 --> 26:42.417
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

26:42.417 --> 26:44.417
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I'M SCARED OF?

26:44.417 --> 26:45.834
'CAUSE I'M NOT SCARED

26:45.834 --> 26:48.291
OF WHETHER OR NOT
WE SLEEP TOGETHER.

26:48.291 --> 26:52.291
IF AND WHEN
YOU AND I DECIDE TO DO THAT,
IT WILL BE RIGHT.

26:52.291 --> 26:54.417
WHAT I AM SCARED OF
IS THAT LITTLE
PIECE OF YOUR HEART

26:54.417 --> 26:56.333
THAT WILL ALWAYS BELONG
TO DAWSON LEERY.

26:56.333 --> 26:59.917
OK? I'M SCARED
OF THAT PIECE OF YOUR HEART

26:59.917 --> 27:03.500
THAT ALWAYS ENVISIONED
YOUR FIRST TIME
BEING WITH HIM.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.917
I'M SCARED
OF THAT PART OF YOU

27:05.917 --> 27:08.041
THAT JUST DOESN'T
WANT IT TO BE ME.

27:08.041 --> 27:10.750
THAT'S WHAT I'M SCARED OF.

27:10.750 --> 27:12.458
THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL?

27:12.458 --> 27:14.875
[LAUGHS]

27:14.875 --> 27:15.834
OH.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.542
Jo: WELL, UM...

27:18.500 --> 27:20.875
WELL, IF THAT'S
HOW YOU FEEL, THEN...

27:23.458 --> 27:26.208
THEN WHY DID YOU STAY?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.708
WHY STICK AROUND
FOR 9 MONTHS

27:28.708 --> 27:31.792
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU BELIEVE, PACEY?

27:31.792 --> 27:35.834
I'M JUST A GLUTTON
FOR PUNISHMENT, I GUESS.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.166
WHOO!

27:57.166 --> 27:58.917
YES.

27:58.917 --> 28:00.458
HA.

28:00.458 --> 28:01.667
I'M A LOUSY DRUNK.

28:01.667 --> 28:04.834
OH, BABY,
YOU'RE A GREAT DRUNK.

28:04.834 --> 28:06.959
NO. THE GREAT DRUNK
BECOMES...

28:06.959 --> 28:09.708
HYSTERICALLY
ENTERTAINING
ONCE INEBRIATED.

28:09.708 --> 28:12.375
I BECOME SOLEMN
AND INTROSPECTIVE.

28:12.375 --> 28:13.834
HEY, DON'T KNOCK
SOLID AND INTROSPECTIVE.

28:13.834 --> 28:17.000
THOSE CAN BE 2 VERY
SEXY QUALITIES.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.166
SEXY...IS THE ABILITY
TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF FUN...

28:20.166 --> 28:21.333
YOU KNOW, LIGHTEN UP.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.667
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
ALWAYS TELLING ME--

28:22.667 --> 28:27.166
JACK, YOU--YOU CAN'T
CLOSE YOURSELF OFF
TO POSSIBILITIES.

28:27.166 --> 28:28.792
SEE, YOU--

28:28.792 --> 28:30.333
YOU'RE A SEXY DRUNK.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.458
HA HA HA!

28:32.458 --> 28:34.125
YOU ARE.

28:34.125 --> 28:36.041
YOU GET BRAVE
AND CRAZY.

28:36.041 --> 28:37.417
NO, YOU'RE MUCH
BRAVER THAN I AM.

28:37.417 --> 28:39.208
NO, I'M NOT.

28:39.208 --> 28:40.708
YEAH.

28:40.708 --> 28:42.166
I'M--I'M--

28:44.917 --> 28:46.125
SCARED.

28:46.834 --> 28:48.750
WHAT ARE YOU
SCARED OF?

28:48.750 --> 28:50.792
I'M, UM...

28:50.792 --> 28:53.291
I'M SCARED THAT
I'M GONNA END UP
ALONE.

28:55.375 --> 28:57.083
I'M SCARED THAT
I'M ALWAYS

28:57.083 --> 29:00.750
GONNA BE SOMEBODY'S
FRIEND OR BROTHER

29:00.750 --> 29:02.583
OR CONFIDANTE

29:02.583 --> 29:04.834
BUT NEVER QUITE...

29:04.834 --> 29:07.500
SOMEBODY'S EVERYTHING.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.417
TCH.

29:08.417 --> 29:10.417
MOSTLY I'M, UH...

29:13.583 --> 29:18.000
I'M SCARED THAT
I'M NEVER GONNA
FIND A GUY...

29:18.000 --> 29:20.792
THAT I LOVE
AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.375
Joey: I'M REALLY
SORRY, DAWSON.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.959
YEAH, ME, TOO.

30:11.458 --> 30:13.458
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:13.458 --> 30:16.125
I FEEL LIKE
I'M DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

30:16.125 --> 30:17.500
THAT'S
THE STRANGEST PART.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.625
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:20.625 --> 30:23.792
I MEAN...AT SOME POINT
IT...HA...

30:23.792 --> 30:25.792
THE WHOLE THING
JUST BECOMES TOO MUCH

30:25.792 --> 30:27.000
FOR YOUR BRAIN
TO PROCESS, YOU KNOW,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.792
AND ALL YOU HAVE
TO RELY ON IS YOUR HEART

30:29.792 --> 30:31.291
AND NATURAL
HUMAN INSTINCTS.

30:31.291 --> 30:33.166
AND IT'S LIBERATING.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.917
I MEAN,
IT'S TERRIFYING
AT FIRST, BUT...

30:35.917 --> 30:38.959
I GUESS THAT'S
THE POINT, ISN'T IT?

30:38.959 --> 30:41.542
WHAT'S THAT?

30:41.542 --> 30:43.834
IF WE WEREN'T
SO AFRAID TO LET GO,

30:43.834 --> 30:45.083
WE WOULDN'T
FEEL SO FREE
WHEN WE FINALLY DID.

30:48.834 --> 30:51.583
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
SO SIMPLE.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.166
HA.

30:53.166 --> 30:55.750
IT'S ANYTHING BUT THAT.

30:57.792 --> 31:01.417
BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT
BROOKS IS WAITING FOR.

31:01.417 --> 31:02.542
YOU KNOW,
EVEN IN HIS STATE,

31:02.542 --> 31:05.208
I THINK HE WAS...

31:05.208 --> 31:07.375
HE WAS WAITING
FOR HIS FRIEND.

31:07.375 --> 31:09.667
TO SAY GOOD-BYE?

31:09.667 --> 31:11.750
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

31:14.208 --> 31:15.291
THAT CAN BE
REALLY HARD.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.750
YEAH.

31:24.959 --> 31:26.834
GOOD-BYE, JOEY.

31:29.667 --> 31:31.583
GOOD NIGHT, DAWSON.

31:49.542 --> 31:51.083
HEY, YOU!

31:51.083 --> 31:51.875
WE WERE JUST
GETTING OUT!

31:51.875 --> 31:54.500
DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D MAKE IT.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.875
I'M NOT MAKING IT,
ACTUALLY.

31:55.875 --> 31:56.708
I WAS JUST TAKING
A WALK.

31:56.708 --> 31:59.125
HEY, YOU LOOK DOWN.

31:59.125 --> 32:02.667
YOU KNOW, SINCE YOU
WERE THERE FOR ME IN
THE NOT-SO-DISTANT PAST,

32:02.667 --> 32:04.708
IT'S ONLY FAIR
I RECIPROCATE, RIGHT?

32:04.708 --> 32:07.166
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS LATER.

32:14.083 --> 32:16.125
GOD, WHAT
ARE WE DOING?

32:16.125 --> 32:17.834
I DON'T KNOW.

32:19.125 --> 32:21.250
WE CAN'T.
WE CAN'T DO THIS.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.166
SAYS WHO?

32:25.083 --> 32:27.166
ME. UM...

32:27.166 --> 32:29.000
I'M SORRY.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.375
I'M SORRY, JACK.
YOU'RE DRUNK.

32:34.041 --> 32:38.875
YOU'RE DRUNK
AND LONELY AND...

32:38.875 --> 32:40.834
AND GAY.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.959
AND AS GOOD AS THIS
SEEMS RIGHT NOW,

32:43.959 --> 32:47.750
AND, I MEAN, IT DOES
SEEM REALLY, REALLY GOOD,

32:47.750 --> 32:49.208
IT...WON'T WHEN
THE FEELINGS PASS.

32:49.208 --> 32:51.375
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT THE FEELINGS
WILL--

32:51.375 --> 32:53.792
JACK.

33:01.291 --> 33:03.500
MY HEAD IS SPINNING.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.417
TELL YOU WHAT...

33:05.417 --> 33:07.583
I'M GONNA GO GET
SOME ICE

33:07.583 --> 33:10.625
AND FIX US A COUPLE
OF TALL GLASSES OF WATER.

33:10.625 --> 33:12.458
AHH,
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

33:17.458 --> 33:18.792
JEN?

33:18.792 --> 33:19.834
YEAH.

33:24.250 --> 33:25.917
I'M SORRY.

34:41.041 --> 34:43.291
SEE YOU, MR. BROOKS.

34:58.875 --> 35:03.083
WHAT...THE...HELL?

35:05.250 --> 35:06.959
HA...

35:06.959 --> 35:08.041
UM...

35:08.041 --> 35:09.667
RECYCLING.

35:10.959 --> 35:12.500
NIGHT.

35:14.667 --> 35:19.583
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT READY TO BREAK UP
WITH HER YET.

35:19.583 --> 35:21.583
THAT'S OK. I GET IT.
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

35:21.583 --> 35:25.917
BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE
A SHAME TO WASTE
THIS OPPORTUNITY.

35:25.917 --> 35:28.000
NO, ANNA, YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T GET IT AT ALL.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.417
THIS IS NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

35:31.417 --> 35:34.625
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S JUST SEX.

35:34.625 --> 35:37.959
IT'S NOT
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.
WE'RE ALL ADULTS, SO--

35:37.959 --> 35:39.917
[LAUGHS] NO, WE'RE
NOT ADULTS.

35:39.917 --> 35:41.375
WE'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO BEING ADULTS,

35:41.375 --> 35:44.708
AND IT IS
THAT BIG A DEAL.

35:44.708 --> 35:46.792
I HAVE SOMEONE
THAT I WANT TO BE WITH

35:46.792 --> 35:49.458
FOR MORE THAN
JUST ONE NIGHT.

35:49.458 --> 35:52.000
SO...THE THOUGHT
OF LOSING HER

35:52.000 --> 35:55.125
OR HURTING HER...
IT'S NOT EVEN
A CONSIDERATION.

35:55.125 --> 35:57.500
FOR ME IT'S NOT
ABOUT WANTING
TO HAVE SEX.

35:57.500 --> 36:01.291
IT'S ABOUT WANTING
TO SHARE THE MOST
INTIMATE THING

36:01.291 --> 36:04.083
THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY
SHARE WITH SOMEONE...

36:04.083 --> 36:06.875
NO MATTER HOW LONG
YOU HAVE TO WAIT.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.333
SO I'M REALLY SORRY
IF I GAVE YOU
THE WRONG IDEA.

36:25.208 --> 36:26.458
HEY.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
HEY.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.917
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN--

36:31.917 --> 36:35.208
LONG ENOUGH
TO REMEMBER WHY IT IS
THAT I LOVE YOU.

36:36.250 --> 36:39.333
WHY EVERY PART OF ME
LOVES YOU.

36:55.333 --> 36:56.458
HEY, PACE.

36:56.458 --> 36:57.542
YEAH?

36:57.542 --> 36:58.542
YOU CAN STILL BE
UPSET.

36:58.542 --> 37:01.708
YOU CAN STILL BE ANGRY.
YOU EARNED IT.

37:01.708 --> 37:03.166
I'M NOT ANGRY WITH YOU.

37:03.166 --> 37:04.291
YOU ARE.

37:04.291 --> 37:07.291
IT'S OK.
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE.

37:07.291 --> 37:11.875
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
PERFECT ALL THE TIME.

37:13.542 --> 37:15.875
AND ME...I, UH...

37:15.875 --> 37:18.083
I DON'T HAVE TO BE
SO AFRAID.

37:26.375 --> 37:29.417
WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU AND I GO IN THERE,
LOCK THE DOOR,

37:29.417 --> 37:32.208
CUDDLE UP TOGETHER,
AND THEN I READ YOU
A STORY?

37:32.208 --> 37:34.708
MMM...

37:34.708 --> 37:37.125
WE DIDN'T BRING
OUR BOOK.

37:37.125 --> 37:38.959
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL MAKE ONE UP.

37:38.959 --> 37:41.959
I LIKE THAT
IDEA.

37:51.875 --> 37:52.583
A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT.

37:56.792 --> 37:58.208
POPCORN.

38:00.375 --> 38:02.417
AND WHAT,
MAY I ASK,

38:02.417 --> 38:04.708
GAVE YOU THE IDEA
TO DO THIS?

38:04.708 --> 38:06.166
UM...ACTUALLY,
YOU DID.

38:06.166 --> 38:08.333
YOU HAD MENTIONED
TO ME THAT YOU'D
NEVER SEEN

38:08.333 --> 38:09.917
ONE OF HIS FILMS--

38:09.917 --> 38:11.125
PICTURES.

38:11.125 --> 38:13.166
THAT WOULD INDEED
BE THE CASE.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.875
WELL, NOT FOR LONG.

38:14.875 --> 38:15.959
LIGHTS.

38:23.125 --> 38:24.583
I THINK...

38:24.583 --> 38:28.583
THIS IS HOW HE WOULD
HAVE LIKED TO BE
REMEMBERED.

38:28.583 --> 38:30.959
I THINK YOU'RE
RIGHT.

38:30.959 --> 38:33.291
LET'S HAVE SOME
POPCORN.

39:15.041 --> 39:16.041
HEY.

39:16.041 --> 39:17.583
HI.

39:17.583 --> 39:19.625
MAY I?

39:19.625 --> 39:20.917
SURE.

39:30.959 --> 39:33.417
HEY, PACE...

39:33.417 --> 39:34.542
MM-HMM?

39:39.208 --> 39:41.625
DO YOU--DO YOU STILL
HAVE YOUR WALLET?

39:44.333 --> 39:46.542
I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE
TALKING ABOUT THAT.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.458
WE ARE.

39:53.417 --> 39:55.417
OK.
[LAUGHS]

39:57.417 --> 39:59.500
YOU GONNA
THROW IT AWAY?

40:04.375 --> 40:06.875
I WANNA THROW
THE WRAPPER AWAY.

40:08.417 --> 40:11.041
[LAUGHS] IF THIS
IS ABOUT WHAT I WAS--

40:11.041 --> 40:13.000
PACEY...

40:16.542 --> 40:20.542
THIS IS ABOUT
HOW YOU CARRIED MY BAG
OFF THE BUS YESTERDAY.

40:22.542 --> 40:25.208
THIS IS ABOUT HOW...

40:25.208 --> 40:27.667
WHEN WE GO TO THE MOVIES
AND YOU GO AND YOU BUY
A POPCORN

40:27.667 --> 40:30.667
YOU ALWAYS MAKE SURE
YOU BRING BACK A NAPKIN

40:30.667 --> 40:32.500
SO I DON'T WIPE
ALL THE GREASE ON MY JEANS.

40:32.500 --> 40:36.125
AND THIS IS ABOUT HOW
JUST LAST WEEK

40:36.125 --> 40:37.750
WHEN WE WERE
AT MINIATURE GOLF

40:37.750 --> 40:41.083
YOU TOOK ALL OF THE SHOTS
FIRST SO I WOULD KNOW
THE CORRECT PATH.

40:41.083 --> 40:42.458
WELL, THAT'S JUST--

40:42.458 --> 40:44.750
YOU TAUGHT ME
HOW TO DRIVE.

40:44.750 --> 40:47.917
AND LAST YEAR AT PROM...

40:47.917 --> 40:50.917
YOU KNEW
THAT THE BRACELET
I WAS WEARING WAS MY MOM'S.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.291
YOU KISSED ME FIRST,
SWEETHEART.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.417
THE SECOND TIME...

40:59.417 --> 41:02.291
YOU COUNTED TO 10
BEFORE DOING IT AGAIN

41:02.291 --> 41:05.500
JUST IN CASE
I WANTED TO STOP YOU.

41:10.792 --> 41:13.125
YOU BOUGHT ME A WALL.

41:14.625 --> 41:16.625
[AHEM] I DIDN'T
BUY IT SO MUCH
AS I--

41:16.625 --> 41:20.125
WE WERE ALONE
ON A BOAT FOR 3 MONTHS

41:20.125 --> 41:23.125
AND YOU UNDERSTOOD
WITHOUT A WORD

41:23.125 --> 41:25.083
WHY I WASN'T READY.

41:32.625 --> 41:35.083
DO YOU HAVE TO ASK ME NOW

41:35.083 --> 41:37.375
WHY I AM?

41:45.291 --> 41:45.667
PACE.

41:51.500 --> 41:54.000
I'M GONNA COUNT TO 10...

41:56.083 --> 42:00.333
AND THEN I'M GOING
TO START KISSING YOU.

42:02.708 --> 42:05.041
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO...

42:08.000 --> 42:10.875
THEN YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO STOP ME.

42:17.708 --> 42:20.000
10, MY LOVE.
