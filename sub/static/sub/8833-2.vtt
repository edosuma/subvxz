00:00.956 --> 00:02.996
It's over, Lorenzo!
The House of Medici falls today!

00:04.116 --> 00:05.250
Lorenzo must be found.

00:05.544 --> 00:07.579
He fled with the help
of the artista Da Vinci.

00:07.613 --> 00:09.280
Then he's alive.

00:09.315 --> 00:11.316
Lorenzo's lost blood,
he needs blood.

00:11.350 --> 00:13.184
I'll give him some of mine.

00:13.219 --> 00:15.653
Know what will happen if
the Pazzis enter these walls?

00:15.688 --> 00:17.789
Death to the Medicis!

00:19.225 --> 00:22.827
Count Riario abandoned you to
pursue some mysterious book.

00:22.862 --> 00:25.029
Where is Da Vinci?
Boarding a ship.

00:25.064 --> 00:27.198
Tell me the name
of the ship.

00:27.233 --> 00:28.466
The Basilisk.

00:28.501 --> 00:30.335
<i>If Da Vinci reaches</i>
<i>the Vault of Heaven,</i>

00:30.369 --> 00:32.070
<i>the Book Of Leaves</i>
<i>is his to claim.</i>

00:32.104 --> 00:33.738
Leonardo will
come for you.

00:33.772 --> 00:36.140
Tragically not for you.

00:36.175 --> 00:38.643
You have failed us,
Da Vinci.

00:38.677 --> 00:42.580
<i>Because of you, the Book Of</i>
<i>Leaves will be lost forever.</i>

00:42.615 --> 00:45.350

What have you done to me?

01:54.086 --> 01:56.721
We cut open your veins
and my arteries

01:56.755 --> 01:58.089
and created a vacuum,

01:58.123 --> 02:01.192
which allowed my own blood
to replenish yours.

02:01.226 --> 02:03.795
Do you mean to say your blood
flows within me?

02:03.829 --> 02:05.730
I realize I'm not your
ideal candidate for blood brother,

02:05.764 --> 02:06.898
but the procedure
was too dangerous

02:06.932 --> 02:08.699
I couldn't
let anyone risk it.

02:12.605 --> 02:14.706
Where is Guiliano?

02:16.976 --> 02:18.910
Stay calm.

02:18.944 --> 02:21.613
As our attempt to save you will
be at risk if you don't.

02:21.647 --> 02:25.683
I wasn't asking you, maestro!
I was speaking to him!

02:25.718 --> 02:28.186
You've been through much,
Magnifico. Please.

02:28.220 --> 02:30.688
Put down the knife.
Where is my brother?

02:32.057 --> 02:34.792
By your allegiance,
Verrocchio, tell me now!

02:34.827 --> 02:39.897
Noble Giuliano
fought bravely.

02:39.932 --> 02:43.101
But was slain.

02:44.303 --> 02:46.971
I'm sorry, my lord.

03:11.797 --> 03:12.997
Take me home.

03:13.032 --> 03:15.733
It won't be that simple.

03:15.768 --> 03:17.068
The streets
are perilous.

03:17.102 --> 03:19.737
The officers of the night
have been helpless

03:19.772 --> 03:22.974
to stop the mob
from burning homes,

03:23.008 --> 03:24.842
looting shops.

03:24.877 --> 03:26.878
You do have Medici support,

03:26.912 --> 03:30.081
but the Pazzis grow
stronger by the hour.

03:30.115 --> 03:33.751
<i>And Urbino's forces</i>
<i>stand outside the city, ready to invade.</i>

03:33.786 --> 03:36.120
I need to see my city.

03:39.925 --> 03:41.926
Out the way for
the Father within!

03:41.960 --> 03:43.895
Grab them! Haul them down!

03:48.934 --> 03:51.302
Go on, get hold of them!

03:52.604 --> 03:54.572
Argh!

03:57.876 --> 03:59.010
Aargh!

04:10.723 --> 04:12.056
Take everything he's got.

04:12.091 --> 04:15.727
They're rebelling
against all authority.

04:18.262 --> 04:20.130
It's mine, give it to me!

04:20.165 --> 04:21.699
<i>Give it to me,</i>
<i>that is mine!</i>

04:25.337 --> 04:26.471
<i>Take it all!</i>

04:31.176 --> 04:36.013
My family spent generations
building up this republic.

04:36.048 --> 04:37.615
And at the drop
of a sword,

04:37.649 --> 04:41.519
the people devour
each other like swine.

04:41.553 --> 04:43.621
They need their leader.

04:47.926 --> 04:50.428
I never wanted to lead.

04:54.967 --> 04:56.167
It doesn't matter.

04:58.437 --> 05:00.004
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>what you want.</i>

05:00.038 --> 05:03.441
<i>Fate made you a leader.</i>

05:03.475 --> 05:05.576
Accept your role
or Florence is lost.

05:05.611 --> 05:08.412
Florence is lost, Da Vinci.

05:08.447 --> 05:10.281
<i>And I have no reason</i>
<i>to win it back.</i>

05:11.650 --> 05:13.785
I have no heir,
no brother.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.789
I have no future
to offer the people.

05:17.823 --> 05:19.824
My lord?

05:19.858 --> 05:23.928
Vanessa,
is this wise?

05:23.962 --> 05:26.464
Perhaps you do have a future
for Florence, my lord.

05:30.002 --> 05:33.437
Giuliano's fire...

05:33.472 --> 05:35.306
..burns still within me.

05:42.381 --> 05:45.116
I'm bearing his child.

05:46.885 --> 05:48.519
Is this true?

05:48.554 --> 05:50.321
It is.

06:18.584 --> 06:20.585
I must return to the palace.

06:23.589 --> 06:25.223
Can you provide me
with a sword?

06:27.893 --> 06:29.660
We will need a lot more
than a sword.

06:40.806 --> 06:42.640
You're brilliant,
passing a hairpin

06:42.674 --> 06:44.442
through a kiss.
Dazzling!

06:46.712 --> 06:48.212
Leonardo said you're
a master lock-pick.

06:48.247 --> 06:50.147
Genius.

06:50.182 --> 06:52.316
You, not him. He's a fool
for ever letting you go.

06:52.351 --> 06:54.352
I have never been
more fully erect.

06:54.386 --> 06:56.387
Want to finish the job?
Gladly.

06:56.421 --> 06:59.056
Not that, the chains!
Of course.

07:26.385 --> 07:27.585
Don't you care
for cured meats?

07:28.987 --> 07:32.356
Or are you so loyal
to Da Vinci

07:32.391 --> 07:35.293
that you'll
starve for him?

07:35.327 --> 07:39.864
Although, will you ever
even see him again?

07:39.898 --> 07:42.833
He's rescuing Florence.
He's rescuing Lorenzo.

07:42.868 --> 07:45.903
Lorenzo is Florence.

07:45.938 --> 07:49.573
Lorenzo is a purse string.

07:54.179 --> 07:56.814
Nico, you took the key to
the Vault of Heaven from me,

07:56.848 --> 08:00.418
something Da Vinci himself
could not manage.

08:00.452 --> 08:05.756
And yet...he chose to save
Lorenzo over you.

08:08.827 --> 08:10.294
I'd say you're undervalued.

08:12.898 --> 08:16.734
As I was at your age.

08:16.768 --> 08:20.905
Like me, you will learn
your worth in time.

08:20.939 --> 08:22.907
I'm not like you!

08:22.941 --> 08:24.675
If you think I'll help you
find the Vault of Heaven,

08:24.710 --> 08:26.010
you're wrong,
I'd die first!

08:28.680 --> 08:31.115
Nico.

08:31.149 --> 08:34.251
The Widow's Tear has already
shown us otherwise.

08:34.285 --> 08:36.287
Proving my theory that

08:36.321 --> 08:40.791
it is better to be
feared than loved.

08:46.631 --> 08:48.032
Why are you keeping me alive?

08:55.474 --> 08:57.041
Because I like you.

09:01.213 --> 09:03.848
Faithful citizens, we burn this
<i>effigy of the tyrant!</i>

09:07.953 --> 09:11.689
Soon his wicked soul
burns in hellfire!

09:11.723 --> 09:14.158
Burn!
<i>Death  the Medicis!</i>

09:31.810 --> 09:33.077
Infernal Pazzis.

09:34.813 --> 09:36.914
If we try to bring Lorenzo
through this frenzy,

09:36.948 --> 09:39.083
Francesco's dogs
will finish him off.

09:39.117 --> 09:42.787
No longer will their
vainglorious cabal of merchants

09:42.821 --> 09:44.855
dictate how all
Florence shall live.

09:46.725 --> 09:51.362
Can you make out a word
that hypocritical windbag is saying?

09:51.396 --> 09:53.864
No, thank God.
Can you?

09:56.134 --> 09:58.069
No.

09:58.103 --> 10:00.971
The just and pious
Pazzi family...

10:04.142 --> 10:07.044
But what if we could?

10:08.780 --> 10:12.783
What if the entire city could?

10:12.818 --> 10:15.119
His lies would spread
like wood rot,

10:15.153 --> 10:20.458
until there wasn't a safe corner
for Lorenzo in all of Florence.

10:20.492 --> 10:25.830
But what if we could
counter those lies?

10:25.864 --> 10:28.799
Do you have any brass
in your studio?

10:28.834 --> 10:32.870
Yes, I'm using it for
the Vitale commission.

10:32.904 --> 10:34.004
Not any more.

10:40.779 --> 10:44.582
All is secure, milady.

10:44.616 --> 10:47.785
Do you have a family, Captain?

10:47.819 --> 10:50.721
A wife, a son...

10:50.755 --> 10:51.856
..a little girl.

10:51.890 --> 10:54.158
Who protects them
whilst you protect us?

10:54.192 --> 10:57.695
My wife has always understood
my duty's to Florence,

10:57.729 --> 11:00.898
as hers is
to our children.

11:00.932 --> 11:04.101
I'll admit I sometimes envy
the time she spends with them.

11:04.136 --> 11:06.937
Don't envy us wives,
Captain.

11:06.972 --> 11:09.507
We pray more than priests,
sleep less than watchmen

11:09.541 --> 11:11.342
and grow old before our time.

11:11.376 --> 11:15.613
Waiting and worrying.

11:15.647 --> 11:16.981
<i>Signora?</i>

11:17.015 --> 11:19.383
Signora? Signora?

11:19.417 --> 11:22.953
You have our condolences
on this very black Easter Monday.

11:22.988 --> 11:26.056
Identify yourselves now.
It's alright, Captain.

11:26.091 --> 11:29.026
<i>This is Signore Sassetti,</i>
<i>general manager of the Medici bank</i>

11:29.060 --> 11:31.195
<i>and Signore Portinari</i>
<i>of the London branch.</i>

11:31.229 --> 11:33.130
If you'll excuse us, Captain.

11:33.165 --> 11:37.368
The Captain will
remain by my side.

11:37.402 --> 11:40.004
Very well.

11:40.038 --> 11:43.274
Rumors of your husband's death
are spreading panic

11:43.308 --> 11:45.342
amongst investors
in Europe.

11:45.377 --> 11:47.745
If we lost their confidence,

11:47.779 --> 11:49.246
the bank will collapse.

11:49.281 --> 11:50.848
Tell them Lorenzo
is alive.

11:50.882 --> 11:54.018
If we could
but see him?

11:54.052 --> 11:56.053
Any business
you have with him

11:56.087 --> 11:57.388
you can submit
to me in writing.

11:57.422 --> 11:59.390
So the rumors are true?

11:59.424 --> 12:00.958
Lorenzo is dead?

12:00.992 --> 12:03.427
Captain, drag him somewhere to
reflect on his loyalties.

12:03.461 --> 12:06.063
Signora, you must understand,

12:06.097 --> 12:09.500
our responsibility is
the fidelity of the bank.

12:09.534 --> 12:14.371
Lorenzo's absence,
however temporary, has created a void.

12:14.406 --> 12:18.576
Perhaps it's prudent to appoint
an interim head of the bank.

12:18.610 --> 12:21.545
I suppose you think yourself
the obvious candidate?

12:21.580 --> 12:24.882
Signore Portinari and I have
the experience for the job.

12:24.916 --> 12:27.551
But not the name.

12:27.586 --> 12:31.622
We are speaking of the great
Medici Bank, after all,

12:31.656 --> 12:32.923
and your
name is not Medici.

12:32.958 --> 12:34.525
<i>Neither is yours,</i>

12:34.559 --> 12:37.528
Signora Orsini.

12:40.098 --> 12:41.565
Captain?

12:41.600 --> 12:45.436
Come, weevils, the lady
is weary of your presence.

12:45.470 --> 12:47.738
Come.

13:19.004 --> 13:21.472
I thought you were
leading me home.

13:21.506 --> 13:23.907
I am.

13:45.964 --> 13:48.098
Look at them.

13:48.133 --> 13:50.134
It's hopeless.

13:50.168 --> 13:53.304
No, you haven't read your Vitruvius.
What?

13:53.338 --> 13:56.473
Sound, it moves like
ripples in water.

13:56.508 --> 13:58.776
And when a ripple touches
a soft surface,

13:58.810 --> 14:00.444
like bodies in a crowd
or a wooden building,

14:00.478 --> 14:02.012
it's absorbed,

14:02.047 --> 14:05.149
as water is absorbed
by a cloth.

14:05.183 --> 14:06.917
Speak plainer, Da Vinci.

14:06.951 --> 14:08.952
Look out across the piazza.

14:08.987 --> 14:12.256
Do you see those shimmering
plates of reflected moonlight?

14:12.290 --> 14:14.158
Yes.

14:14.192 --> 14:17.961
Those are brass panels
positioned according to my calculations,

14:17.996 --> 14:21.465
each held at precise angles by
Verrocchio and his assistants.

14:21.499 --> 14:25.402
When a sound ripple reaches
a reflective service, it's deflected -

14:25.437 --> 14:30.074
under the right
circumstances, amplified.

14:30.108 --> 14:32.776
Acoustically speaking,
this tower

14:32.811 --> 14:35.045
is the most strategic
point in Florence.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.116
You want me to make
a speech?

14:39.150 --> 14:41.118
What does it matter?

14:41.152 --> 14:43.153
Francesco Pazzi
is winning.

14:43.188 --> 14:46.990
Only 'cause everyone
thinks you're dead.

14:47.025 --> 14:52.996
You have to tell the people that
you haven't abandoned them.

14:53.031 --> 14:55.566
Da Vinci?

15:04.976 --> 15:07.878
Da Vinci.
What's that bastard doing?

15:07.912 --> 15:08.846
Look, look!
Up there.

15:12.183 --> 15:15.285
Pull! Put your backs into it!
Pull, for goodness sake!

15:15.320 --> 15:16.954
Quickly, damn it!

15:16.988 --> 15:19.556
If this doesn't work,
the mob will pull them both to pieces.

15:19.591 --> 15:21.592
Wait, out, out.

15:21.626 --> 15:24.228
Out here. That's it.

15:24.262 --> 15:25.462
Good, good.

15:25.497 --> 15:28.599
The stage is yours,
Magnifico.

15:28.633 --> 15:33.237
If this fails, they will throng my palace
and slay my family!

15:33.271 --> 15:35.038
Face your city.

15:37.041 --> 15:38.242
There.

15:38.276 --> 15:41.445
See what they make of you.

15:55.093 --> 15:57.428
Look to your people,
Lorenzo.

15:57.462 --> 15:59.863
You need to inspire them,

15:59.898 --> 16:01.999
to invite them
to join you,

16:02.033 --> 16:06.603
to dare them to be
as great as they are.

16:17.048 --> 16:18.849
Citizens of Florence...

16:18.883 --> 16:20.884
<i>It's Lorenzo!</i>

16:20.919 --> 16:22.653
I grieve with you tonight...

16:24.689 --> 16:29.460
<i>..for the injuries inflicted</i>
<i>on our noble city,</i>

16:29.494 --> 16:32.696
<i>on our families,</i>

16:32.730 --> 16:34.731
<i>and on my beloved brother,</i>

16:34.766 --> 16:38.502
Giuliano...

16:38.536 --> 16:41.104
Get him down from there!

16:41.139 --> 16:43.907
Go, move!

16:43.942 --> 16:49.513
<i>I once embraced</i>
<i>Francesco Pazzi</i>

16:49.547 --> 16:53.417
<i>and his family</i>
<i>as my friends.</i>

16:53.451 --> 16:56.787
<i>I thought them noble</i>
<i>citizens of Florence.</i>

16:59.524 --> 17:02.659
<i>But as I stand</i>
<i>before you tonight,</i>

17:02.694 --> 17:06.597
<i>as our city is aflame,</i>

17:06.631 --> 17:10.000
<i>and my brother lies dead,</i>

17:10.034 --> 17:15.472
I was naive,
blind to their ambition,

17:15.507 --> 17:19.309
ignorant to the lengths
they would go

17:19.344 --> 17:24.748
to see our city
under Rome's thumb!

17:26.851 --> 17:31.355
He's a salesman... a usurer.

17:31.389 --> 17:33.423
Citizens, don't let
him bedevil you.

17:33.458 --> 17:37.494
Yet we have not fallen!

17:37.529 --> 17:39.296
In Florence,

17:39.330 --> 17:44.935
power has always
been derived from the people,

17:44.969 --> 17:50.040
not from traitorous whispers
in quiet, dark halls,

17:50.074 --> 17:53.443
not from individuals...

17:53.478 --> 17:57.481
not from conspirators.

18:00.385 --> 18:03.687
<i>And so, as it should be,</i>

18:03.721 --> 18:09.593
I put the fate of
our republic in your hands.

18:13.665 --> 18:16.867
<i>Do with me as you please.</i>

18:16.901 --> 18:20.003
For whatever you command,

18:20.038 --> 18:25.309
I will perform it willingly.

18:25.343 --> 18:27.311
<i>This is not good.</i>

18:27.345 --> 18:30.480
<i>For tonight, as always...</i>

18:32.383 --> 18:36.687
..you are my friends...

18:36.721 --> 18:40.724
..my protectors...

18:40.758 --> 18:45.195
..my brothers.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.169
Do you think they heard me?

18:55.006 --> 18:57.874
Palle!

18:57.909 --> 19:00.444
Palle!

19:00.478 --> 19:04.314
Palle!

19:04.349 --> 19:07.451
The Medici rallying cry.

19:07.485 --> 19:09.019
I'd say they did.

19:09.053 --> 19:12.389
Palle! Palle!

19:12.423 --> 19:14.691
Palle! Palle!

19:22.834 --> 19:25.636
Francesco, let's go!

19:25.670 --> 19:29.740
Palle! Palle!

19:58.603 --> 20:01.672
Now, Dragonetti.

20:01.706 --> 20:05.709
Now we apprehend
the Pazzi traitors.

20:05.743 --> 20:07.277
My pleasure.

20:13.751 --> 20:15.752
There they are!
No, wait!

20:15.787 --> 20:17.788
Hold him!
By the Reverend Father!

20:17.822 --> 20:19.122
Help me!

20:28.332 --> 20:30.634
Orsini!

20:33.705 --> 20:36.273
Palle! Palle!

20:50.855 --> 20:53.757
<i>He's the leader! Pazzi scum!</i>

21:02.066 --> 21:03.700
Argh!

21:47.311 --> 21:49.346
Argh!

21:49.380 --> 21:50.680
Agh!

22:14.572 --> 22:17.908
My dear lady.

22:17.942 --> 22:23.280
I commend you for your
strength and courage,

22:23.314 --> 22:26.183
in holding our home
against those

22:26.217 --> 22:28.351
who would
seek our life.

22:47.071 --> 22:49.906
Welcome home, husband.

23:02.119 --> 23:05.956
Palle! Palle!

23:08.893 --> 23:11.528
<i>I'm told our awaited guest</i>
<i>has a penchant</i>

23:11.562 --> 23:13.263
for such curiosities.

23:13.297 --> 23:18.635
It is said he keeps a kind
of ghastly museum in his dungeon.

23:18.669 --> 23:20.804
Surely the museum
is apocryphal?

23:20.838 --> 23:26.409
His reputation as a ferocious,
bloodthirsty warlord is not.

23:32.049 --> 23:34.251
His dress bespeaks
a warrior.

23:34.285 --> 23:38.455
That's the son, Alfonso.
Behind him is the King.

23:39.824 --> 23:41.825
This is your warlord?

23:41.859 --> 23:43.927
He looks more
like a bookkeeper.

23:43.961 --> 23:47.397
May I present His Majesty King
Ferrante of Naples

23:47.431 --> 23:50.066
and his son, Alfonso,
Duke of Calabria.

23:52.436 --> 23:55.505
You'll forgive us for not kneeling
and kissing the ring.

23:55.539 --> 23:58.008
I too am anointed by God.

23:58.042 --> 24:01.745
And are you also Christ's Vicar
here on earth...

24:01.779 --> 24:04.681
his holy sign
that he will come again?

24:06.317 --> 24:09.419
<i>It matters not.</i>

24:09.453 --> 24:11.021
Down to business.

24:11.055 --> 24:12.889
As the only king
on the Italian peninsular,

24:12.924 --> 24:16.593
you understand our need
for stability?

24:16.627 --> 24:19.629
We command the largest
standing army in Italy.

24:19.664 --> 24:21.965
It is we
who assure stability.

24:21.999 --> 24:25.035
We also command
a sizeable force.

24:25.069 --> 24:28.238
A flock of mercenaries.

24:28.272 --> 24:31.474
Rome has her priests, Florence
her art, Genoa her trade.

24:31.509 --> 24:34.311
But it is Naples
and our forces

24:34.345 --> 24:36.346
who have been tasked by God

24:36.380 --> 24:39.082
as the first line of defense
against the Ottomans.

24:40.418 --> 24:43.687
You must know that the tyrant,
Lorenzo de Medici,

24:43.721 --> 24:48.258
and his heretic war engineer,
Leonardo Da Vinci, openly flout us?

24:48.292 --> 24:50.493
I've known Lorenzo
since he was a child.

24:50.528 --> 24:51.861
He's an unscrupulous villain

24:51.896 --> 24:56.833
who's a little too proud
of his prick.

24:56.867 --> 24:59.836
I'm sorry, I misspoke.

25:03.307 --> 25:06.309
Holy Father,
disregard what I said.

25:10.181 --> 25:12.615
He knows better than to be here
when the tooth falls.

25:17.688 --> 25:21.925
Where did you find such
an interesting specimen?

25:21.959 --> 25:25.562
Consider it a gift,
one of many to come.

25:29.300 --> 25:34.504
Lorenzo's regime
must be eroded from within...

25:34.538 --> 25:37.140
..to keep the armies
of Milan and Venice

25:37.174 --> 25:40.010
from
allying against us.

25:41.345 --> 25:44.848
Once you have helped us
seize Florence,

25:44.882 --> 25:48.284
the other secular states
of Italy will fall into line,

25:48.319 --> 25:51.554
and into the control

25:51.589 --> 25:55.392
of the Godly
state of Naples.

25:55.426 --> 26:00.230
You seek an alliance with us
against Florence?

26:01.699 --> 26:04.300
How may we be of service?

26:07.004 --> 26:09.906
There is a papal ship
in the port of Pisa,

26:09.940 --> 26:11.941
carrying slaves to Genoa.

26:11.976 --> 26:14.744
If your brave son
traveled there

26:14.779 --> 26:19.215
under both the Neapolitan
and papal flags,

26:19.250 --> 26:23.386
the Republic of Florence
would be cowed by our alliance.

26:24.722 --> 26:27.557
Lorenzo is a heathen
but he's not a fool.

26:27.591 --> 26:33.430
We will apply unrelenting
pressure...

26:33.464 --> 26:35.832
..till he does what's best
for his people,

26:35.866 --> 26:38.835
and surrenders.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.522
You asked to see me,
Your Magnificence?

26:52.828 --> 26:55.296
You were leaving before
this massacre began.

26:55.331 --> 26:59.501
I assume you still
intend to leave?

26:59.535 --> 27:01.536
But we need you here.

27:01.570 --> 27:04.572
Rome's aggression
will not stop.

27:04.607 --> 27:08.309
We need more pipe organ
muskets, more military...

27:08.344 --> 27:11.413
And then what?
Then what?

27:11.447 --> 27:14.082
They return with more soldiers,
more allies.

27:14.116 --> 27:17.852
The way to defeat them
is not by racing them to the next weapon.

27:17.887 --> 27:22.090
You alone know how to deal
with Florence's enemies.

27:24.827 --> 27:29.998
I search for an ancient tome
called the Book Of Leaves.

27:30.032 --> 27:32.867
It's a compendium
of hidden wisdom

27:32.902 --> 27:35.403
that men have
died to protect.

27:35.438 --> 27:39.908
Sixtus and his cohorts, they
moved mountains to find it.

27:39.942 --> 27:42.977
I believe it contains secrets
that could put an end

27:43.012 --> 27:45.046
to these petty wars
that besiege us forever.

27:45.081 --> 27:48.616
Whispers, forbidden
knowledge made up

27:48.651 --> 27:50.552
to entertain
adolescent boys.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.488
Perhaps you recall
lying on a slab

27:53.522 --> 27:54.923
while my blood pumped
into your veins.

27:54.957 --> 27:58.093
Forbidden knowledge
just saved your life.

27:58.127 --> 27:59.761
And in the name
of this knowledge,

27:59.795 --> 28:03.031
you would desert
Florence again?

28:07.103 --> 28:08.169
Do you know what this is?

28:08.204 --> 28:11.439
One of my grandfather's
trinkets.

28:11.474 --> 28:13.341
It's the symbol of
the Sons of Mithras.

28:13.375 --> 28:16.010
Have you heard of them?
Cosimo had many secrets.

28:16.045 --> 28:18.813
They were an ancient brotherhood
committed to humanism.

28:18.848 --> 28:21.349
Cosimo was one of
its members.

28:21.383 --> 28:24.953
He had faith in this city,
in you.

28:24.987 --> 28:29.190
Your grandfather, he saw Florence
as the essential city,

28:29.225 --> 28:33.194
where for once, freedom and
knowledge had been allowed to take root.

28:33.229 --> 28:38.299
He tasked me from beyond
the grave to retrieve the Book Of Leaves.

28:38.334 --> 28:41.970
And when I do,
you must ensure

28:42.004 --> 28:46.541
that Florence
is still here to receive it.

28:46.575 --> 28:47.575
But I can't...

28:47.610 --> 28:53.414
leave Florence without--
money,

28:53.449 --> 28:55.550
without a ship.

28:55.584 --> 28:57.552
Da Vinci, I cannot help you.

28:57.586 --> 29:00.321
Florence needs weapons,
not magic.

29:00.356 --> 29:04.392
Go, leave us.
Do as you wish.

29:04.426 --> 29:08.696
As my family have done
for quite some time,

29:08.731 --> 29:12.167
I will preserve the city,

29:12.201 --> 29:14.402
without your help.

29:17.773 --> 29:18.773
Farewell.

29:33.989 --> 29:37.692
Sister.
Oh, my prayers are answered.

29:57.580 --> 29:59.247
Francesco,
you sought to sweep

29:59.281 --> 30:00.949
the Medici name
from the earth.

30:00.983 --> 30:03.718
<i>And we will answer</i>
<i>your conspiracy in kind.</i>

30:05.754 --> 30:08.823
Tomorrow, go to your death
knowing that it is your name

30:08.858 --> 30:10.225
that will be expunged.

30:10.259 --> 30:13.194
Your properties will be divided
<i>among the Signoria,</i>

30:13.229 --> 30:15.196
<i>all male cousins</i>
<i>will be exiled,</i>

30:15.231 --> 30:18.333
and anyone who dares to marry
a Pazzi woman will be disinherited.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.570
You'd wipe out the oldest

30:22.605 --> 30:26.341
and most noble family
in Florence?

30:26.375 --> 30:28.309
My ancestor was
the first over the wall

30:28.344 --> 30:30.011
in the Siege
of Jerusalem.

30:30.045 --> 30:31.379
Save your creaking anecdotes.

30:31.413 --> 30:35.216
We're sick to death
of your Pazzi ancestor.

30:35.251 --> 30:36.885
<i>Future generations</i>
<i>will only remember</i>

30:36.919 --> 30:41.289
that the meaning of the
word Pazzi...is madmen.

30:46.929 --> 30:49.898
You left your robes in your
quarters when you fled, Cardinal.

30:49.932 --> 30:53.067
I have them here for you.
Thank you, sister.

30:53.102 --> 30:55.837
I have prayed for you
every day.

30:55.871 --> 31:00.642
The populace should see the fate
of those who ally themselves with Rome.

31:00.676 --> 31:03.478
<i>So you will put on</i>
<i>those robes.</i>

31:03.512 --> 31:07.382
And we will dangle you
from the gibbet in your Sunday best.

31:08.817 --> 31:10.385
Think of your eternal soul.

31:10.419 --> 31:12.620
Do you dare kill
a cardinal?

31:12.655 --> 31:15.023
One who defiled the Lord's house
on Easter Sunday?

31:15.057 --> 31:16.190
Yes, I would.

31:17.826 --> 31:20.161
Please!

31:20.195 --> 31:21.362
I am your brother.

31:21.397 --> 31:23.197
I have no brother.

31:28.370 --> 31:31.039
Your confidence as a thief
is beguiling.

31:31.073 --> 31:32.740
I have no intention
of being recognized

31:32.775 --> 31:36.878
on the road
to Florence.

31:36.912 --> 31:38.913
Stop gaping like
a pike and move!

31:38.948 --> 31:40.949
You know what
Riario's capable of.

31:40.983 --> 31:43.051
Has anyone ever told you
you'd make a beautiful man?

31:43.085 --> 31:45.186
Anyone ever told you
you're a pig?

31:45.220 --> 31:47.288
You're a bit of a traitor.
Pig and a knave.

31:47.323 --> 31:48.923
Traitor and a whore.

31:51.994 --> 31:53.261
That's a compliment.

31:55.097 --> 31:58.499
All my favorite people
are traitorous whores.

32:02.338 --> 32:05.840
<i>It's unsettling, isn't it?</i>

32:05.874 --> 32:09.344
One of your kinsmen had it
inscribed in his flesh for safekeeping,

32:09.378 --> 32:11.980
little good
that it did him.

32:12.014 --> 32:14.015
I believe it's a legend,

32:14.049 --> 32:16.985
a key to reading a map -
this map.

32:17.019 --> 32:19.287
Can you decipher it?

32:24.259 --> 32:28.129
Much of it is beyond
my understanding.

32:28.163 --> 32:31.199
But these-- these are written

32:31.233 --> 32:34.302
in the ancient Ge'ez script
of my people.

32:34.336 --> 32:37.205
They are numbers.

32:37.239 --> 32:41.175
13, 1,631...

32:41.210 --> 32:43.378
over 10,000.

32:43.412 --> 32:45.413
It's a fraction.

32:45.447 --> 32:48.716
Arabs use them to represent
parts of a whole number.

32:48.751 --> 32:50.184
What does this one say?

32:50.219 --> 32:54.889
72 and 341...

32:54.923 --> 32:57.692
over 625.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.727
The astrolabe.

32:59.762 --> 33:04.832
The numbers indicate
latitude and longitude.

33:04.867 --> 33:07.368
Captain De Noli
will be pleased.

33:13.142 --> 33:17.745
And...what will please you?

33:20.282 --> 33:23.084
The Bible counsels us against
indulging ourselves.

33:23.118 --> 33:26.621
Men of the Bible
took their pleasures.

33:28.957 --> 33:31.626
King Solomon visited
the Kingdom of Sheba,

33:31.660 --> 33:34.262
my homeland of Abyssinia.

33:34.296 --> 33:36.664
There he met
the beautiful queen and...

33:36.698 --> 33:40.902
invited her to a banquet
at his palace.

33:40.936 --> 33:45.006
She asked Solomon to swear
not to take her by force.

33:45.040 --> 33:48.049
He agreed...as long as she

33:48.074 --> 33:50.344
would take nothing
of value from his home.

33:50.345 --> 33:52.146
Seems an easy vow to keep.

33:52.181 --> 33:54.549
But when she awoke
at midnight,

33:54.583 --> 33:56.551
the Queen was...

33:56.585 --> 34:00.521
thirsty.

34:00.556 --> 34:03.758
And as she reached for water,
Solomon appeared,

34:03.792 --> 34:07.095
warning she was
breaking her oath.

34:07.129 --> 34:10.630
Nothing in the desert
is as precious as water.

34:10.666 --> 34:12.667
She chose to drink,

34:12.701 --> 34:18.272
setting Solomon free from
his promise not to take her.

34:18.306 --> 34:22.643
And they spent the night
together willingly.

34:23.911 --> 34:27.915
The Queen of Sheba
fell in love with Solomon.

34:27.949 --> 34:32.719
She converted my homeland
to the Lord God of Israel...

34:32.754 --> 34:35.456
without regret.

34:37.559 --> 34:41.696
That story's
not in the Bible.

34:41.730 --> 34:44.065
Not everything is,
my lord.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.299
What do you know of Daedalus?

35:20.169 --> 35:21.836
Just indulge me.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.539
<i>What were the sins</i>
<i>of Daedalus?</i>

35:24.573 --> 35:27.975
He fashioned wings for himself
and his son Icarus.

35:28.010 --> 35:31.279
Flight, is that a sin?

35:31.313 --> 35:32.947
Or is it an invention?

35:38.554 --> 35:42.056
Whilst I was unconscious,
Andrea,

35:42.090 --> 35:44.759
I had a vision.

35:44.793 --> 35:47.929
I was in the presence
of something.

35:51.066 --> 35:54.202
Something.
You'd lost a lot of blood, Leo.

35:54.236 --> 35:56.237
Don't be troubled by dreams.

35:56.271 --> 35:57.905
The dream was real, Andrea.

35:57.940 --> 35:59.240
Look.

35:59.274 --> 36:02.677
There, that figure.

36:02.711 --> 36:05.079
A man being savaged by a bull?
Yes!

36:05.113 --> 36:07.782
Here, on the reverse
of the Turk's coin,

36:07.816 --> 36:11.786
a man slaying a bull -
it's the inverse image.

36:13.288 --> 36:16.123
I've met the enemies
of the Sons of Mithras.

36:17.993 --> 36:21.095
These aren't fables, Andrea.

36:21.129 --> 36:24.198
You may be right, my boy.

36:24.233 --> 36:26.934
All the more reason
to leave it alone.

36:26.969 --> 36:30.805
We can't do that, maestro.

36:30.839 --> 36:34.075
Zo, you stayed in Florence?

36:34.109 --> 36:36.310
Not quite.
But I made it back here.

36:36.345 --> 36:38.479
Where's Nico?

36:40.249 --> 36:44.852
He's on the Basilisk
with Riario.

36:46.154 --> 36:49.056
You let Riario take Nico?

36:49.091 --> 36:50.891
I wasn't exactly given
an option.

36:50.926 --> 36:53.928
I was supposed to be
on that ship, not Riario!

36:53.962 --> 36:56.264
Certainly not Nico with him! Me!

36:56.298 --> 36:59.166
Didn't the Turk say the ship
was wrecked in a storm?

36:59.201 --> 37:00.134
How does Nico survive that?

37:00.168 --> 37:01.969
Do I fucking know?

37:02.004 --> 37:05.740
I'd go after them,
I've got...next to nothing.

37:05.774 --> 37:07.775
I've got no ship,
no astrolabe.

37:07.809 --> 37:10.645
I mean, there's
the original charts.

37:10.679 --> 37:14.749
But the Abyssians' map
that explains it all is with Riario.

37:14.783 --> 37:17.818
Surely you can reproduce the
Abyssinians' map from memory?

37:17.853 --> 37:22.056
Yes, but I cannot will a
crew and ship into existence.

37:23.592 --> 37:25.693
Well, there's someone
that can help.

37:25.727 --> 37:30.564
But you've got to promise
to stay calm, accept the fucking help.

37:43.245 --> 37:45.246
Why would you come
to my aid?

37:45.280 --> 37:48.082
Why did you miss your ship
to assist Lorenzo?

38:06.034 --> 38:09.670
There is a man
named Vespucci.

38:09.705 --> 38:12.740
He solves import and export
problems for the Medicis,

38:12.774 --> 38:14.408
it's his business
to know every boat

38:14.443 --> 38:16.911
that comes in
and out of Pisa.

38:16.945 --> 38:19.613
He could find you a ship
and a crew.

38:19.648 --> 38:21.182
And...

38:21.216 --> 38:24.719
..he collects
rare maritime maps.

38:24.753 --> 38:28.656
Perhaps he has one like
the one that you lost.

38:33.495 --> 38:35.496
And what do you want
in return?

38:35.530 --> 38:37.832
From you? Nothing.

38:37.866 --> 38:42.536
Sixtus destroyed
my family.

38:42.571 --> 38:47.007
What I want,
what I have always wanted...

38:47.042 --> 38:49.043
..is to see him dead.

38:49.077 --> 38:54.248
Nonetheless, you came here
to face me first.

38:55.584 --> 38:58.552
I look at you and see
how you refuse

38:58.587 --> 39:01.756
to be trapped by your
birth and circumstances.

39:01.790 --> 39:04.225
I just fight to be free.

39:04.259 --> 39:09.096
I need a future
where I control my own fate.

39:09.131 --> 39:12.333
And my pursuit
of the same freedom...

39:15.003 --> 39:17.772
..will take me
far from you.

39:39.094 --> 39:43.964
This belongs to your father.

39:43.999 --> 39:47.768
Perhaps you could
return it to him.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.871
With my regards.

39:57.779 --> 40:02.149
It's mine now.

40:02.184 --> 40:06.086
And I would see it
stay with you...

40:06.121 --> 40:07.955
since I can't.

40:15.697 --> 40:17.431
I...

40:20.001 --> 40:24.538
I still think of a world in
which we met differently,

40:24.573 --> 40:27.475
lived differently.

40:30.011 --> 40:32.146
As do I.

41:03.478 --> 41:05.212
Sister!

41:11.052 --> 41:13.988
They call for your death,
Francesco.

41:14.022 --> 41:16.857
Only hours ago,
they cheered for yours.

41:17.759 --> 41:20.227
And yet...

41:20.262 --> 41:23.097
..here we are.

41:23.131 --> 41:25.132
Let us send a message...

41:25.166 --> 41:29.203
to your master in Rome,

41:29.237 --> 41:32.873
that Florence still shines!

42:13.281 --> 42:14.915
Amerigo Vespucci?

42:14.950 --> 42:17.651
He works for the Medicis.
Lucrezia recommended him.

42:17.686 --> 42:19.286
I knew him,
we grew up together

42:19.321 --> 42:20.788
in Peretola,
he's a fixer.

42:20.822 --> 42:21.956
And a fuck.

42:23.058 --> 42:24.291
This is the worst
idea you've had

42:24.326 --> 42:26.627
since you stopped eating
meat. He's a slippery eel.

42:26.661 --> 42:30.531
A well-connected eel
who's yet to lose a map, an astrolabe,

42:30.565 --> 42:32.866
a ship and Nico to Riario.

42:32.901 --> 42:34.168
Perhaps he can apprentice you.
I did as you asked.

42:34.202 --> 42:36.136
I asked you not to go!

42:36.171 --> 42:39.940
You asked me to stall!
To stall the barge, not the Basilisk.

42:39.975 --> 42:41.976
That was too
great a risk.

42:42.010 --> 42:43.477
You never consider anything
too great a risk.

42:43.511 --> 42:45.446
You knew we'd do
whatever we could

42:45.480 --> 42:47.748
to aid your damned
adventure, we always have.

42:47.782 --> 42:50.784
And you make the whole thing
sound so fucking important.

42:50.819 --> 42:52.419
It is important!

42:52.454 --> 42:54.521
Perhaps more than
I even realized.

42:54.556 --> 42:58.626
There are worse things crouching
in the shadows than Riario.

42:58.660 --> 43:03.464
Things I cannot
yet understand.

43:03.498 --> 43:06.800
We will get Nico back, Zo,
I promise.

43:06.835 --> 43:11.138
But then, we must recover
the Book Of Leaves.

43:11.172 --> 43:14.375
Can I count on you?

43:16.978 --> 43:19.913
I will go to the edge of the
earth with you to find Nico.

43:19.948 --> 43:22.449
After that...

43:22.484 --> 43:24.518
I'm sorry, I'm done.

43:25.620 --> 43:30.190
I don't care about
your Book Of Leaves.

43:34.129 --> 43:36.563
This is the place.

43:48.810 --> 43:51.445
Yes?

43:51.479 --> 43:53.947
Excuse us, signorina.

43:53.982 --> 43:55.582
We're here to see
Amerigo Vespucci.

43:55.617 --> 43:58.619
Bless you for coming to pay
respects to my poor father,

43:58.653 --> 44:03.290
ignored while the rest
of Florence grieves Giuliano di Medici.

44:03.324 --> 44:05.926
Please, come in.

44:21.142 --> 44:22.142
That's your father?

44:22.177 --> 44:25.546
Amerigo Vespucci? Yes.

44:25.580 --> 44:27.781
And you must be his friends.

44:27.816 --> 44:30.100
That's us then.
Sorry for your loss.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.221
Hold on.

44:33.655 --> 44:36.156
That stench.
<i>It's the body, Leo, we're too late.</i>

44:36.191 --> 44:37.858
Maybe we can catch Lucrezia,

44:37.892 --> 44:39.326
see if she knows any living
people to help us.

44:39.360 --> 44:40.761
I have spent time
around cadavers.

44:40.795 --> 44:42.096
That is not the scent
of human flesh.

44:42.130 --> 44:44.932
Urgh! That was completely
unnecessary.

44:44.966 --> 44:48.435
Any friend of Lucrezia
Donati is a friend of mine.

44:48.470 --> 44:51.805
Zoroasta, last I saw
of you was in prison.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.408
Never trust a Spanish Moor,
am I right?

44:56.010 --> 44:59.213
Run along, Beatrice.
I will find you

44:59.247 --> 45:00.848
next time I'm in need
of a daughter.

45:00.882 --> 45:02.983
Arrivederci, signores.

45:03.017 --> 45:05.119
Typical, I should have known.

45:05.153 --> 45:08.188
I apologize for
the theatrics.

45:08.223 --> 45:09.823
I was afraid you were sent here
by my creditors.

45:09.858 --> 45:13.393
You understand?
Absolutely.

45:13.428 --> 45:15.429
I like you, Signore...?

45:15.463 --> 45:17.464
Da Vinci.
Leonardo Da Vinci?

45:17.499 --> 45:21.602
Lorenzo's bastard war engineer,
the pleasure is mine.

45:21.636 --> 45:23.504
What is the nature
of your problem?

45:23.538 --> 45:25.706
Well, I'm supposed to
on board a ship,

45:25.740 --> 45:27.708
The Basilisk.

45:27.742 --> 45:30.511
Three-masted carrack, captain
Antonio De Noli, crew of 15,

45:30.545 --> 45:33.580
carrying top-of-the-line
Florentine textiles,

45:33.615 --> 45:35.549
left Pisa two days ago
sailing west.

45:35.583 --> 45:37.584
It's been commandeered
by Count Riario,

45:37.619 --> 45:39.286
Captain General
of the Holy Roman Church.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.955
I see. So you wish
to sail west

45:41.990 --> 45:43.157
but the Vatican
have stolen your ship.

45:43.191 --> 45:44.892
If you're here,
you have not the coin

45:44.926 --> 45:46.193
to hire such
a vessel,

45:46.227 --> 45:51.532
which leaves but one choice
available, am I right?

45:51.566 --> 45:53.567
We head to Pisa...

45:53.601 --> 45:57.137
we steal one of theirs.

46:09.350 --> 46:10.818
Signora.

46:10.852 --> 46:13.020
This is Vanessa Moschella.

46:13.054 --> 46:14.388
<i>Moschella?</i>

46:14.422 --> 46:16.256
A little flea?

46:16.291 --> 46:18.725
How amusing that you work
at the Barking Dog.

46:18.760 --> 46:21.228
If you think so.

46:23.965 --> 46:27.367
We're told that you carry
Giuliano's seed.

46:27.402 --> 46:28.869
Yes, signora.

46:28.903 --> 46:31.872
How can we be sure that
you're telling the truth?

46:31.906 --> 46:34.374
I'm not really concerned
if you believe me or not.

46:34.409 --> 46:37.211
Lorenzo believes it.

46:37.245 --> 46:39.379
And right now,
he's in need of some hope.

46:39.414 --> 46:40.848
So you will remain with us.

46:40.882 --> 46:42.850
Piero will see
to your needs.

46:42.884 --> 46:45.285
Here?

46:45.320 --> 46:47.888
You don't like our home?

46:47.922 --> 46:49.623
I prefer the freedom
of my own.

46:49.657 --> 46:50.891
You should've
thought of that

46:50.925 --> 46:55.329
before Giuliano bedded you
in some sordid tavern.

46:56.200 --> 46:59.974
He had dozens of women,
from milkmaids...to duchesses.

46:59.975 --> 47:02.815
God help us if they all come
knocking with their bastards.

47:13.059 --> 47:15.059
We are...

47:16.528 --> 47:19.563
We are here to honor...

47:19.598 --> 47:22.132
Giuliano di ser
Piero di Medici...

47:26.204 --> 47:28.105
..my brother.

47:31.376 --> 47:34.078
You knew him as
the Prince of Youth,

47:37.015 --> 47:40.985
the Light of Florence.

47:41.019 --> 47:44.788
So he was.

47:45.390 --> 47:48.292
So he was.

47:48.326 --> 47:49.560
You're doing fine.

47:51.529 --> 47:54.031
It is a splendid eulogy
so far.

47:56.334 --> 47:57.468
He deserves better.

48:01.573 --> 48:07.211
What's this?
It was our grandfather Cosimo's.

48:07.245 --> 48:11.482
One magnificent sword
to be shared by two boys.

48:11.516 --> 48:13.617
I never understood why.

48:16.288 --> 48:19.990
Cosimo told us we would
learn to use it...

48:20.025 --> 48:23.127
..one day,

48:23.161 --> 48:24.628
when we were ready.

48:27.599 --> 48:30.000
When we became men.

48:34.005 --> 48:35.139
We never did.

48:39.244 --> 48:42.713
I think Giuliano would
want you to keep it.

49:38.603 --> 49:39.670
You're leaving?

49:45.377 --> 49:47.978
I wish I could
go with you, Leo.

49:48.012 --> 49:51.448
Where I'm going...

49:51.483 --> 49:54.318
..I can no longer
keep you safe.

49:54.352 --> 49:58.255
Much less,
your child.

50:02.293 --> 50:05.829
So now I'm one of them?
<i>Is that really so bad?</i>

50:05.864 --> 50:10.200
Note the only time he brought me
here was to say goodbye.

50:12.937 --> 50:16.106
The Medicis are wise.

50:16.141 --> 50:18.275
They will realize,

50:18.309 --> 50:22.112
how lucky they are to
have you among them.

50:30.155 --> 50:31.755
Release her.

50:31.790 --> 50:36.393
She's not to be swept into your
madness any longer.

50:36.428 --> 50:40.497
<i>The guards saw you entering.</i>

50:40.532 --> 50:44.301
Lorenzo wishes
one more word.

50:44.335 --> 50:46.603
You can wait
in the pantry.

51:01.352 --> 51:03.921
Vanessa carries a child

51:03.955 --> 51:08.358
whose father never
married its mother.

51:08.393 --> 51:10.327
Make sure you take
care of this one

51:10.361 --> 51:12.930
better than the last
bastard you dealt with.

51:28.780 --> 51:30.948
This Book Of Leaves you seek.

51:30.982 --> 51:33.183
Do you really believe
it could help Florence?

51:33.218 --> 51:36.420
More than help it,
Magnifico.

51:36.454 --> 51:39.189
I believe it can save it.

51:42.327 --> 51:45.095
You and I are not that
different, Da Vinci.

51:46.898 --> 51:49.366
It took me a while
to realize that.

52:08.887 --> 52:09.720
Did this belong
to your grandfather?

52:09.754 --> 52:11.755
He told me...

52:11.789 --> 52:13.757
that one day...

52:13.791 --> 52:15.759
when the time was right...

52:15.793 --> 52:18.262
I would learn how
to use it.

52:22.433 --> 52:24.801
I saw you fight off many men
in the Duomo,

52:24.836 --> 52:28.305
I would say you already have.

52:28.339 --> 52:30.007
That's
not what he meant.

52:37.148 --> 52:41.652
Giuliano and I, we were always
meant to share it.

52:41.686 --> 52:45.722
That's what brothers do.

52:45.757 --> 52:50.694
Two men whose blood flows
in each other's veins.

52:55.733 --> 52:59.236
Take it with you
on your journey.

53:07.011 --> 53:11.915
All I ask is that you return to
Florence when your quest is completed,

53:11.950 --> 53:15.719
along with whatever wisdom your
