00:16.184 --> 00:21.222
(woman humming)

00:25.293 --> 00:28.262
(man)
Just one, one more nice...

00:28.296 --> 00:31.799
(woman humming)

00:33.601 --> 00:36.204
Pecorino Crotonese, sir.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.072
It's one
of my favorites.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.307
That's nice.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.544
That's it.
That's it?

00:43.577 --> 00:45.179
Thanks very much.
Have a great day.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.514
Anytime.
All right, you got it.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.548
Enjoy.

00:47.581 --> 00:48.616
Have a good holiday.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.219
(woman humming)

00:52.653 --> 00:55.756
Can I get a pound
of the Italian roast?

00:55.789 --> 00:58.526
Like, for an espresso machine.

00:58.559 --> 01:02.062
Thank you.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.133
It's little a less,
okay, sir?

01:09.137 --> 01:11.539
Can I get some of these?
The colored ones.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.441
Half a pound of rugelach.
Is that all right?

01:13.474 --> 01:15.309
Which kind?
Uh, chocolate.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.344
Chocolate?
Yeah.

01:20.681 --> 01:21.815
Thank you,
have a great day.

01:21.849 --> 01:25.853
You too,
take care.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.669
Yes?

01:41.702 --> 01:45.306
Hi, um, I'm the guy
who brought you your pills.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.307
Remember the elevator?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.941
Oh, yes.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.477
Oh, thank you so much.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.478
Yeah, that was me.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.012
God bless you.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.948
Well, uh, well,
so, I've got your keys.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.817
Oh, I've been
looking for them.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.486
Yes, I figured that
was kind of a thing.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.520
Oh, thank you.

01:59.553 --> 02:00.821
You're okay now.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.022
You're not
in there anymore.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.757
No, I'm not stuck.
That's good.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.025
You're okay now.
Yes.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.627
That would be bad
if you were still there.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.961
Yes, it would.

02:07.995 --> 02:10.198
I'd be dead.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.332
Um, okay.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.134
Also, um, your niece--

02:14.168 --> 02:15.336
Amia.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.171
Amia?
Um-hm.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.972
Well, she brought me a pie.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.108
I know,
she baked it for you.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.676
Yeah?
Yeah.

02:22.710 --> 02:25.112
Okay, well, so I got you
a few things at the store.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.214
Just--

02:26.247 --> 02:28.349
Oh, no, look at that.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.050
Oh, that is so nice.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.719
I'm not trying to one-up her
or anything, but I just--

02:31.752 --> 02:34.322
No.
Please come in.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.691
Oh, thank you,
okay, uh, sure.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.826
(door bangs)

02:38.859 --> 02:39.960
Oh, sorry.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.197
Is Amia--
Is she here?

02:43.231 --> 02:46.400
No, she had to go out.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.269
Oh, okay.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.573
Do you want to leave?

02:52.606 --> 02:54.875
No. No, I--

02:58.212 --> 02:59.847
Mmm.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.183
Good.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.986
What are you, um--
Where are you from?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.255
Hungary.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.356
Have you been?

03:08.389 --> 03:09.323
No.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.891
Oh, you should go.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.726
It's so beautiful.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.762
Do you--
Do you travel?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.096
Not much.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.431
I, um-- I mean,
around the country,

03:17.465 --> 03:18.766
but not much around the world.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.401
Mm-hmm.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.904
I have been to, um,
Iraq and Afghanistan, though.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.107
Oh, were you
in the army?

03:27.140 --> 03:28.542
No, no.

03:28.576 --> 03:32.045
I was, uh, like, I was
entertaining the troops.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.914
What kind
of entertaining?

03:33.947 --> 03:36.550
Um, I'm a comedian.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.118
No!
Me too.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.254
I'm a comedian.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.422
What?

03:41.455 --> 03:43.391
Yes.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.293
Well, I did this
as a girl.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.095
My whole family did this.

03:48.128 --> 03:50.431
We would do music and--

03:50.464 --> 03:54.435
and be funny for the troops,
make them laugh, you know.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.769
Really?
Yes.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.772
Amia's father,
um, my brother--

03:58.806 --> 03:59.873
Yeah.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.276
And me and my mother
and my father.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.612
And we would--
we would do funny music

04:04.645 --> 04:07.080
and the Hungarian army,
they loved us.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.148
They always had us.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.950
Wow.
Yeah.

04:09.983 --> 04:10.951
What was your act?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.052
What did you do?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.322
Well, I would sing,
you see.

04:14.355 --> 04:17.124
And I would sing, like,
a very romantic--

04:17.157 --> 04:18.326
Wait, I show you.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.460
I know.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.762
Okay.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.831
Oh, I forgot.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.466
I have to do it
in English.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.000
I don't know if
I can do that.

04:27.034 --> 04:27.968
Let me see.

04:28.001 --> 04:31.939
**

04:31.972 --> 04:33.474
You have to picture--

04:33.507 --> 04:35.676
I was a very young girl
and very pretty,

04:35.709 --> 04:36.777
all right,
when I sing.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.811
You mean like now.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.947
No, no, no,
like then.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.649
Okay.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.584
** I love you

04:43.617 --> 04:46.587
* Oh yes I do

04:46.620 --> 04:49.990
* If you love me too

04:50.023 --> 04:54.428
* That's good then we can--

04:54.462 --> 04:56.597
I missed it,
I start again.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.631
(cell phone rings)
Not Hungarian.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.167
Sorry.
Sure.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.535
Oh, I gotta take this.

05:01.569 --> 05:04.271
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.839
Hello?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.307
Is this Louis?

05:07.341 --> 05:08.676
Yah.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.210
Your daughter Jane
is in the office,

05:10.243 --> 05:11.278
and you need to come get her.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.846
What happened?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.715
We are not willing
to deal with this behavior.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.650
You need to come pick her up.

05:16.684 --> 05:19.152
Actually, today's her day
with her mother, so--

05:19.186 --> 05:20.854
I tried the mother,
there's no answer.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.823
You need to pick up Jane now.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.191
Okay.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.193
I'll be there in a minute.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.561
Thank you.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.563
Jane.
Jane!

05:29.597 --> 05:30.531
You better relax.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.400
Relax.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.368
Everything all right?

05:34.402 --> 05:37.805
My daughter's in trouble
and I gotta go--

05:37.838 --> 05:40.040
I mean, she's all right,
she's causing the trouble.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.709
I gotta go, I'm sorry.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.077
No, I'm sorry.

05:47.114 --> 05:51.919
Hi.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.086
Uh, so what happened?

05:53.120 --> 05:56.524
Just take her home,
Papa.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.825
Let's go, Jane.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.928
Let's get out of here.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.864
Listen, I'm sorry.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.299
She's--

06:11.705 --> 06:13.273
Drink all of that.

06:13.306 --> 06:14.775
Drink more.

06:14.808 --> 06:15.843
You need it.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.879
Why?
You need it.

06:18.912 --> 06:23.951
Hi, uh, I have Jane,
and she's not in school.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.252
And I can't reach you,

06:25.285 --> 06:29.557
so I'll just hold on
to her till, um,

06:29.590 --> 06:31.725
I hear from you.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.462
A thing happened and I--
And we need to talk.

06:34.495 --> 06:37.498
All right, bye.

06:43.837 --> 06:48.609
Were you leaving
a message for Mommy?

06:48.642 --> 06:50.511
(coughs)

06:51.512 --> 06:54.247
(sighs)

06:54.281 --> 06:58.185
What happened today?

06:59.352 --> 07:01.922
I don't know.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.156
You don't know?

07:03.190 --> 07:04.558
Nothing happened.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.493
Nothing happened?

07:05.526 --> 07:07.294
No, nothing.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.363
That's why we're out here
in the middle of a school day?

07:13.667 --> 07:14.802
All right, look,

07:14.835 --> 07:16.269
it doesn't matter
what happened.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.471
I'll find out anyway,
it doesn't matter.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.139
But what's going on?

07:19.172 --> 07:20.974
What's going on
with you?

07:21.008 --> 07:22.309
I don't know.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.777
Look at me,
look at me.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.113
What's going on with Jane?

07:26.146 --> 07:29.717
Jane-- Jane in school,
Jane in Jane.

07:32.352 --> 07:35.856
Are you mad at me?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.290
No.

07:37.324 --> 07:41.328
What are you--
Are you mad at Mommy?

07:41.361 --> 07:43.831
Are you mad at Lily?

07:43.864 --> 07:47.267
Are you mad at Jane?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.669
How could I be
mad at me?

07:48.702 --> 07:50.037
It's--
I can't be mad at me.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.371
Okay, well,
help me out, honey.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.006
I'm trying to--
What is it?

07:53.040 --> 07:55.342
I don't want
to go to school.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.777
School?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.011
I mean it.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.513
I don't want
to go there anymore.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.948
I don't like it.

08:00.981 --> 08:01.982
It's not good.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.951
Why?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.485
They don't know anything.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.020
They don't know
how to tell me anything

08:07.054 --> 08:08.556
I need to know.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.524
And they don't know anyway
and they lie.

08:10.558 --> 08:14.394
The teachers are stupid,
the kids are stupid.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.564
Really,
they're all stupid.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.698
I'm not just saying this.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.600
It's true.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.572
Christopher Columbus
is a murderer.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.841
They want me to draw
a picture of him smiling.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.743
They don't know how
numbers work,

08:29.777 --> 08:32.379
and they want me
to do it all wrong.

08:32.412 --> 08:36.516
The kids are just
mean babies.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.720
They don't know anything,

08:39.753 --> 08:42.856
really, and the teachers
don't know anything.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.992
They're mean
and tired

08:45.025 --> 08:46.594
and they're stupid

08:46.627 --> 08:48.395
and they just say
what's in the book.

08:48.428 --> 08:51.098
Because they don't know,
you see?

08:51.131 --> 08:52.933
They don't answer
any real questions.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.501
They don't answer
any what?

08:54.534 --> 08:55.669
Real questions.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.337
Real questions?
No real questions.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.674
Like, what's-- what's--
what kind of questions?

09:00.708 --> 09:04.411
Like, why is there
even an America?

09:04.444 --> 09:06.914
How come France isn't
part of New York City?

09:06.947 --> 09:10.117
Why isn't, let's say,

09:10.150 --> 09:12.920
Africa or India in charge
when they have the most people?

09:12.953 --> 09:17.625
And why isn't
God on the news?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.961
What happened today?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.930
(sighs)

09:22.963 --> 09:25.098
Fine, I was on
the spring horse.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.700
On the what?

09:26.734 --> 09:28.068
It's like a horse
that you ride on a spring.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.536
It's in the playground.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.904
And there's
only three of 'em.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.741
So me and two other kids
were on them.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.743
Then Melissa really
wanted to ride.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.411
So I said, "Okay,
she can half my turn

09:38.445 --> 09:39.947
as long as she gives me
back the other half."

09:39.980 --> 09:42.415
But then she never
let me back on.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.817
Then she let
another kid have it,

09:43.851 --> 09:45.452
and then another kid have it.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.254
And then, like, all the kids
were making a game out of

09:47.287 --> 09:48.956
not letting me
have the spring horse.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.458
And then the teacher came over
and told me to be quiet,

09:51.491 --> 09:52.592
and said I was punished

09:52.626 --> 09:54.261
and I couldn't play anymore.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.797
Daddy, I tried to explain
to her, I really tried.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.633
Okay?
And she would not listen.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.601
No matter calm and normal,

10:01.635 --> 10:03.637
taking a breath,
nothing worked.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.438
She just would not
listen ever.

10:05.472 --> 10:06.907
No. Not listen.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.275
What'd you do?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.677
(sighs)

10:11.511 --> 10:13.180
What did you do?

10:13.213 --> 10:16.483
I clutched her skirt
and tore it off

10:16.516 --> 10:19.019
and everyone could
see her underwear.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.855
Daddy, she was really upset.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.157
She was crying.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.826
They-- (muffled).

10:27.728 --> 10:30.698
I'm sorry, Daddy.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.739
(sighs)

10:47.647 --> 10:50.450
Daddy, when am I
going to see you again?

10:50.483 --> 10:53.553
Uh, Wednesday,
on our regular day.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.889
Hey, Patrick.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.858
Oh, hey.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.060
I'm just--
just dropping off Jane.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.395
Oh, great,
thank you.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.397
I need to talk to her mom.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.733
Janet.

11:05.766 --> 11:09.837
Ah, okay.
Uh, Janet.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.571
Jane, go to your room.

11:11.604 --> 11:12.572
We'll talk later.

11:12.605 --> 11:13.974
Bye, Daddy.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.142
See ya.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.143
I'm sorry,
I was caught up

11:16.176 --> 11:17.244
in meetings all day.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.379
It's okay.
Um, can we talk?

11:19.412 --> 11:20.547
Okay.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.850
No, I mean,
let's go talk, okay?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.417
Let's get something.

11:24.451 --> 11:29.489
Let's go out somewhere
and talk, all right?

11:29.522 --> 11:34.194
Uh, I'm just gonna go
around the corner for a minute.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.569
Well, you know what
I'm going to say.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.871
What?

11:43.904 --> 11:46.573
Private school.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.008
No.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.442
You can't just say no.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.544
No.
Yes, I can.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.846
Louie.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.949
Look, public school is--
is the real world.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.550
And they have real problems

11:57.584 --> 12:00.387
and they learn how to deal
with them in the real world.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.089
That's gonna be their life.

12:02.122 --> 12:06.059
Putting them in private school
is like sequestering them.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.128
In the real world,
when you have a problem,

12:08.161 --> 12:10.297
you don't get to go to some
little tailor-made,

12:10.330 --> 12:12.532
paid-for little egg
of inside of it

12:12.565 --> 12:14.034
where everything's gonna be

12:14.067 --> 12:16.436
the way that your parents
paid for it to be.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.805
How are they going
to get any skills?

12:17.838 --> 12:18.906
Give them a chance.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.740
Well, it's not working.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.409
She's 10 and you're
counting her out already?

12:22.442 --> 12:23.643
It's over?

12:23.676 --> 12:25.112
Let's talk about
the real reason

12:25.145 --> 12:26.980
you don't like
private school.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.248
What?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.950
It's about you.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.484
And that you grew up
working class

12:31.518 --> 12:33.053
and you have
a chip on your shoulder

12:33.086 --> 12:34.754
about people who can send
their kids to private schools.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.089
Stop.
Stop now.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.624
And the fact is
that you can't afford it

12:37.657 --> 12:41.494
and you resent it,
and I can afford it.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.997
Janet, just 'cause
you make more now

12:44.031 --> 12:46.066
doesn't mean that you get
to have more decision

12:46.099 --> 12:47.634
over what our kids do.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.337
Actually it does.

12:50.370 --> 12:54.174
You're-- You're going
down a road here.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.076
Yes.
Yes I am.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.678
Janet, don't try to steamroll
our kids into private school

12:58.711 --> 13:00.280
because I won't allow it.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.783
And I won't allow
your screwed-up stuff

13:03.817 --> 13:07.154
to keep my kids in some
substandard school.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.321
That's--
Your kids?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.756
Your kids.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.024
See, this is--
See, this is about you.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.125
This isn't about me.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.793
This is about how--

13:13.827 --> 13:17.097
Yeah, this is about how
your kids reflect your status.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.365
It's you and your
and it's not--

13:18.398 --> 13:20.000
It's not about--

13:20.033 --> 13:21.801
We we're supposed to be
talking about Jane.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.803
We're talking about us,
and it's not the point.

13:23.837 --> 13:27.474
Well, I'm not going
to let my kids be losers.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.809
Well, I'm not going to let
my kids be Hitler youth.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.444
What?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.180
You're not gonna like
send them to some academy,

13:33.213 --> 13:35.015
so you can put a crest
on their shoulder

13:35.048 --> 13:38.151
that you get to brag about
in the aisles of Whole Foods

13:38.185 --> 13:40.854
and they grow up not knowing
what a person is.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.990
You are way out of line.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.491
I know that.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.525
What?

13:45.558 --> 13:46.559
I know I'm out of line.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.328
I'm too emotional,

13:48.361 --> 13:50.697
and I'm too upset now
to contribute anything real

13:50.730 --> 13:51.965
to the conversation

13:51.999 --> 13:53.233
because you got me
to this place.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.201
Oh, so it's my fault?

13:54.234 --> 13:55.835
No, it's not.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.237
I'm saying that I'm not--

13:57.270 --> 14:01.208
I can't say anything
worthwhile anymore.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.876
I'm too upset
and it's all about--

14:02.910 --> 14:05.345
It's about my fear
about the kids

14:05.378 --> 14:07.747
and it's about our stuff
that we never solved

14:07.780 --> 14:10.884
and you're totally right
that this about my problems

14:10.918 --> 14:12.219
and my issues

14:12.252 --> 14:13.553
and anything that has
to do with you

14:13.586 --> 14:15.222
you're not going to admit to.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.890
So I'm taking it all up
to myself and it's--

14:16.924 --> 14:19.159
This is-- There's no way
for me to say anything

14:19.192 --> 14:20.760
but shit now,

14:20.793 --> 14:24.864
which is all that's
coming out of my mouth.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.534
(sighs)

14:27.567 --> 14:32.705
Okay.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.874
What do you want to do?

14:34.908 --> 14:40.981
Let's just-- Let's just
talk about this later.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.205
Oh, hi.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.306
Hello.
Hi!

15:06.339 --> 15:08.741
Hello.
Hello.

15:08.775 --> 15:09.876
Hello.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.945
Uh...

15:11.979 --> 15:16.049
Hey, um, do you want
to get something to eat?

15:16.083 --> 15:19.319
Do you want to go out to eat?

15:19.352 --> 15:21.254
No, I'm going--
Out?

15:21.288 --> 15:23.490
Yeah, like you and me.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.058
Nom, nom, like,
eat something together.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.327
Oh. Most.
Most?

15:27.360 --> 15:28.628
Most?
Most.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.397
Is that most
to eating?

15:30.430 --> 15:31.564
Nem, nem, most.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.133
Oh, now.
Yes, now.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.168
Now.
Yeah, now?

15:35.202 --> 15:36.236
Most?

15:36.269 --> 15:37.337
Oh, okay, okay.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.905
Yeah? Okay.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.673
Okay.
Yeah.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.442
Okay.
Let's get, uh...

15:42.475 --> 15:44.177
This is the best.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.678
It's called
Russ and Daughters.

15:45.712 --> 15:46.746
There you are.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.747
Oh, my God.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.316
Okay, so here's what you do.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.619
You just take it
and you just eat it.

15:52.652 --> 15:53.753
Oh!

15:53.786 --> 15:55.188
(speaks Hungarian)

15:55.222 --> 15:56.856
Come on, try it,
it's really good.

15:56.889 --> 15:57.957
(speaks Hungarian)

15:57.991 --> 16:00.060
Okay.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.829
(speaks Hungarian)

16:02.862 --> 16:03.963
You can do it.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.766
Okay.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.636
(chuckling)

16:09.669 --> 16:10.670
Is it good?

16:10.703 --> 16:11.838
Do you like it?

16:11.871 --> 16:14.807
Oh, no,
you don't like it.

16:14.841 --> 16:20.813
Oh, I think she
needs a spit cup.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.882
Are you okay?

16:22.915 --> 16:24.651
I'm sorry, I thought
you would like it.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.154
Most people really like it.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.857
**

16:31.824 --> 16:32.892
What's that light?

16:42.569 --> 16:44.837
And that is New Jersey.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.573
Oh.
New Jersey, yeah.

16:46.606 --> 16:47.640
New Jersey.
Yeah.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.741
New Jersey.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.611
(woman humming)

17:21.040 --> 17:23.443
**

17:42.495 --> 17:43.696
Hairbrush?

17:43.730 --> 17:45.532
Hairbrush?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.634
No.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.778
Hair... what?

17:58.811 --> 18:03.250
(speaks Hungarian)

18:03.283 --> 18:05.385
I don't know.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.487
Shampoo?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.156
Nem, nem, nem shampoo.
Okay.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.623
(speaks Hungarian)

18:10.657 --> 18:12.992
All right.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.394
Um.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.495
Okay.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.496
Okay.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.564
(speaks Hungarian)

18:17.597 --> 18:19.932
All right.

18:28.275 --> 18:32.812
Okay.

18:32.845 --> 18:36.483
All right.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.991
(speaks Hungarian)

18:47.960 --> 18:50.530
Oh, not sure
what that one was.

18:50.563 --> 18:55.902
(speaks Hungarian)

18:57.870 --> 18:59.506
Mmm.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.845
(speaks Hungarian)

19:10.417 --> 19:11.784
Okay.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.222
(speaks Hungarian)

19:15.255 --> 19:17.624
Towel.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.892
(speaks Hungarian)

19:22.429 --> 19:24.731
Oh, okay,
okay, okay.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.233
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.201
Wait a second.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.803
Hair dryer.
(speaks Hungarian)

19:30.837 --> 19:32.205
(laughing)

19:32.239 --> 19:33.973
All right,
awesome.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.043
Here, come on, let's go
pay for this hair dryer.

19:43.616 --> 19:47.019
Bye.
Bye.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.757
Um, okay.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.191
I had a good time,
it was nice.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.261
I needed a co--
I needed-- Thank you.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.568
Bye.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.304
Bye.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.246
I think cannibalism is reviled.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.348
A lot of people even say like,
"If I was in a plane crash,

20:15.382 --> 20:17.384
I would not eat the people,
I would just die."

20:17.417 --> 20:21.621
I would eat all the people.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.423
But I don't--
I don't know.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.725
Like, okay, if a plane crashed
and you had to eat people--

20:25.758 --> 20:27.193
Okay, like,
there's all kinds of people.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.695
You have to make a decision
within that.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.430
Like, who--
What kind of person

20:30.463 --> 20:33.900
do I want to eat, and like,
what part of the person?

20:33.933 --> 20:37.870
I think I would eat
an old black lady's tits.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.272
Beca--

20:46.145 --> 20:48.781
Because that's
way not me.
