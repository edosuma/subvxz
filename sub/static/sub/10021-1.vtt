00:20.203 --> 00:21.693
I called them.

00:23.206 --> 00:25.572
- What happened? Is he okay?
- I think he slipped.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.208
No, looks like he fainted.

00:27.410 --> 00:30.072
Okay. Everybody, get back.
Get back, okay?

00:30.280 --> 00:31.872
Come on. We got a doctor here.

00:32.082 --> 00:34.380
The hospital's nearby.
Some guy ran for help.

00:34.584 --> 00:36.950
My head hurts. This pavement's hard.

00:37.253 --> 00:39.312
All right, I'll help you.

00:39.522 --> 00:40.489
I'll help you.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.658
- You shouldn't move his neck.
- God!

00:42.859 --> 00:45.487
- Are you okay?
- I just told you my head hurts!

00:45.695 --> 00:48.493
Don't worry. You'll be fine.
We'll all help you.

00:48.698 --> 00:50.598
- Want us to do something?
- We got to...

00:50.800 --> 00:53.030
- Coming through!
- Excuse us.

00:53.603 --> 00:56.037
- Sir, are you okay?
- Yeah. Can you help me up?

00:56.239 --> 00:58.764
- We'll check you first. Name?
- Barry Mahoney.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.533
- He fell down.
- Thank you.

01:00.744 --> 01:04.144
- And he's bleeding a little.
- Thanks. We'll take it from here.

01:04.547 --> 01:08.950
- Carol, we need to stabilize his neck.
- I'll get a C-collar and a gurney.

01:09.252 --> 01:10.446
Jen's gone for a month?

01:10.653 --> 01:12.814
She's taking depositions
in St. Louis...

01:13.022 --> 01:15.286
...and figured it would be
easier to stay.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.620
- My head still hurts.
- Just a small scalp laceration.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.193
Nothing to worry about.

01:20.396 --> 01:22.489
And she's letting Rachel
stay with you?

01:22.699 --> 01:26.726
Reluctantly. Rachel didn't want to
miss soccer camp, so she's staying.

01:26.936 --> 01:30.497
Okay, let's get a saline line going.
TKO, CBC and a Chem-20.

01:30.707 --> 01:32.504
- Portable C-spine?
- Yeah, thanks.

01:32.709 --> 01:34.506
And a 12-lead EKG.

01:34.711 --> 01:37.043
- Can we help you?
- Just making sure he's okay.

01:37.247 --> 01:41.149
- Family needs to wait in Chairs.
- I was passing by and tried to help.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.717
Didn't do much.
Put her coat under my head.

01:43.920 --> 01:48.254
I'm sure he's grateful, but passers-by
need to wait out in Chairs too.

01:48.458 --> 01:50.949
Accu-Check, 124. Hemo-Q, 13.8.

01:51.161 --> 01:54.221
I'm supposed to be here.
I'm a third-year med student.

01:54.430 --> 01:55.727
I start ER rotation today.

01:55.932 --> 01:57.126
Man, is that today?

01:57.333 --> 01:59.096
- So this lab coat is yours.
- Yes.

01:59.302 --> 02:00.291
What should I do?

02:00.503 --> 02:01.527
- Name?
- Lucy Knight.

02:01.738 --> 02:03.968
Ms. Knight,
welcome to County General.

02:04.174 --> 02:07.940
- You need to wait in Chairs.
- I shouldn't do anything?

02:08.211 --> 02:11.510
- Carol?
- Left, down the hall, then a right.

02:12.682 --> 02:14.149
Should I at least observe?

02:14.350 --> 02:16.682
Left, down the hall, then a right.

03:17.180 --> 03:18.647
Lucy, you just get here?

03:18.848 --> 03:20.645
Bernard, what are you doing?

03:20.850 --> 03:22.044
What happened?

03:22.252 --> 03:25.244
A fire-twirler burned his butt
and the troupe's waiting.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.686
What is all this? You look like
some geek, pacing around.

03:28.892 --> 03:30.484
I am a geek pacing around.

03:30.693 --> 03:33.423
- Taking Dr. Weaver's audio tour.
- Who's Dr. Weaver?

03:33.796 --> 03:36.663
Kind of short,
red hair, uses a crutch.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.433
They have you sitting here?

03:38.635 --> 03:40.830
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

03:41.271 --> 03:42.863
I gotta get back to my tour.

03:43.072 --> 03:45.905
What are you doing later?
I gotta practice drawing blood.

03:46.442 --> 03:50.276
They won't make you do procedures
at first. All right, I'll find you.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.608
- Out of the way!
- Trauma One's clear.

03:53.816 --> 03:57.081
- What do we got?
- Multiple GSWs to the head and chest.

03:57.287 --> 04:01.280
GCS 7, BP 60 palp, two large-bore IVs,
normal saline, a liter in the field.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.925
Prep a Thora-Seal
and set up for a chest tube.

04:04.127 --> 04:05.287
- Lucy Knight?
- Yeah.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.190
Jerry Markovic, service coordinator.

04:07.397 --> 04:10.161
Dr. Greene will show you around
as soon as he can.

04:10.366 --> 04:13.858
Just throw your stuff in the lounge
and come back to the desk.

04:18.041 --> 04:21.305
- I'm sorry. Did I interrupt?
- We thought you were Jerry.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.445
The unit service coordinator.
I just met him.

04:23.646 --> 04:26.080
You must be a new med student,
right?

04:27.216 --> 04:30.310
Jerry's the desk clerk. He pulls
the "unit" thing on newcomers.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.612
It's his birthday.

04:31.821 --> 04:33.618
Don't tell him about the cake.

04:33.823 --> 04:35.450
- Chuny Marquez.
- Lily Jarvik.

04:35.658 --> 04:38.422
- Yosh Takata.
- Lucy Knight. Should I use a...?

04:40.296 --> 04:42.127
Excuse me, I'm looking for Jerry.

04:42.332 --> 04:45.665
He went down to the roach coach
to get his breakfast burrito.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.302
That's why my dad says he's...

04:48.871 --> 04:51.305
- What did you do?
- Not much, actually.

04:51.507 --> 04:54.271
I was hoping he knew
if there were extra lab coats.

04:54.477 --> 04:56.741
- They keep them under the desk.
- Great.

04:56.946 --> 05:00.006
- Your dad works here?
- He's one of the bosses.

05:00.216 --> 05:03.674
Well, he used to be the only boss
until Dr. Weaver butted in.

05:04.687 --> 05:06.746
Here they are.
What's your name?

05:06.956 --> 05:07.820
- Rachel.
- I'm Lucy.

05:08.024 --> 05:09.321
- Hello again.
- Oh, hi.

05:09.525 --> 05:10.651
- Mark Greene.
- Lucy...

05:10.860 --> 05:13.192
Knight. Rachel, why are
you still here?

05:13.396 --> 05:15.990
- I'm watching the desk.
- Only for a moment.

05:16.199 --> 05:18.326
Mrs. Williams doesn't pick me up
until 8:30.

05:18.534 --> 05:21.560
Yeah? It's 8:35.
Good luck on your game.

05:21.771 --> 05:24.433
I'll pick you up at the Williams'
before dinner.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.904
- Bye. Bye, Jerry, happy birthday.
- Thanks, Rach.

05:28.111 --> 05:29.578
- Settling in?
- I had a...

05:29.779 --> 05:33.806
Jerry, tell Radiology to hurry
up on those films for that clavicle.

05:34.017 --> 05:35.746
I was waiting out in Chairs.

05:35.952 --> 05:37.385
That leg in Four needs sutures.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.953
Doyle or Carter.
Yosh Takata, Lucy Knight.

05:40.156 --> 05:41.783
- Hi. We met.
- Hi.

05:41.991 --> 05:44.858
Sitting in Chairs?
We'd better get you going.

05:45.061 --> 05:47.996
We'll start off with charts,
then the board. Quick tour.

05:48.197 --> 05:49.425
Then some patients.

05:49.632 --> 05:52.157
- Am I to be assigned to a Resident?
- Later.

05:52.368 --> 05:54.165
Grab a chart, pick up your patient.

05:54.370 --> 05:56.838
No jumping over
for a more interesting case.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.804
Put your initials here,
patient's name, chief complaint...

06:00.009 --> 06:01.806
...and what labs you've ordered.

06:02.011 --> 06:04.445
- Why don't you try one?
- Name is Clements.

06:04.647 --> 06:09.016
- Chief complaint is "mult lac"?
- Multiple lacerations. Right.

06:09.218 --> 06:11.243
Waiting on a head CT and suturing.

06:11.487 --> 06:14.251
Doctor is M.D., which doesn't
stand for "doctor."

06:14.457 --> 06:17.824
That means Maggie Doyle.
Don't worry, you'll catch on.

06:18.027 --> 06:20.120
You're thinking about
emergency medicine?

06:20.329 --> 06:22.160
I'm not sure. It's my first rotation.

06:22.365 --> 06:25.300
Curtain Area One. Curtain Area Two.
Exam Room One.

06:25.501 --> 06:27.332
This is Exam Room Two.

06:28.171 --> 06:30.469
- And this is Dr. Carter.
- What?

06:30.673 --> 06:34.905
Carter's one of our finest Residents
even though he sleeps on the job.

06:35.111 --> 06:36.237
Lucy Knight.

06:36.446 --> 06:38.710
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry, Dr. Greene.

06:38.915 --> 06:41.145
I haven't had much sleep
since that R.A. Job.

06:41.350 --> 06:45.081
Life in the dorm, huh?
Better you than me.

06:45.288 --> 06:47.153
Patients, Carter. Place is full.

06:47.356 --> 06:48.482
Right.

06:52.095 --> 06:54.427
This is Trauma One, which you've seen.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.064
- Who are we saving?
- Nobody. He's arrested twice.

06:57.266 --> 07:00.394
Another soldier to the drug war.
Tucked away in his pants.

07:00.603 --> 07:04.699
This is Lucy Knight, third-year.
Doctors Benton and Weaver.

07:04.907 --> 07:06.568
Nurses Lydia Wright and Malik McGrath.

07:06.776 --> 07:08.266
Two units O-neg on the infuser.

07:08.478 --> 07:11.003
- You know Mr. Gamely?
- Yeah, I just saw him.

07:11.214 --> 07:14.650
As soon as he's done with the tour,
I'll find you. It's useful.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.319
- BP's 40 palp.
- He's flatline.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.818
Thoracotomy tray. Come on, Malik.
Let's move.

07:22.825 --> 07:26.124
Trauma Two. Blissfully quiet,
which is the way we like it.

07:27.163 --> 07:29.654
This is the Suture Room,
where Dr. Doyle is suturing.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.527
- Lucy Knight, third-year.
- Hey.

07:31.734 --> 07:32.723
Nice to meet you.

07:32.935 --> 07:35.904
- Who's Sleeping Beauty?
- Mr. Clements passed out.

07:36.105 --> 07:40.041
He got drunk and walked through
a plate-glass window. You idiot.

07:40.243 --> 07:43.440
Dr. Doyle throws in attitude
when presenting a patient.

07:43.646 --> 07:45.011
- He'll be okay?
- Oh, yeah.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.580
As long as he doesn't mind
gnarly scars.

07:49.452 --> 07:50.885
- Mr. Gamely, I presume?
- Yeah.

07:51.087 --> 07:54.079
Drug lockup's in here.
Lab is down the hall.

07:54.290 --> 07:57.885
Radiology, around the corner.
Exam Room Four.

07:58.961 --> 08:01.191
Sorry to barge in. You got a minute?

08:01.397 --> 08:03.331
Sure. Be right back.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.328
Lucy Knight. Doug Ross, pediatrician.

08:05.535 --> 08:06.934
- Hi, how you doing?
- Fine.

08:07.136 --> 08:11.163
All right, Ms. Knight. Why is otitis
media found primarily in children?

08:11.374 --> 08:14.366
They have short eustachian tubes
and fluid doesn't drain...

08:14.577 --> 08:16.602
...making it perfect
for a bacterial infection.

08:16.812 --> 08:19.713
- Okay. Treatment?
- Amoxicillin or Pediazole.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.682
We may be over-treating because
many of the cases are viral.

08:23.886 --> 08:26.377
Antibiotics aren't necessary
and may contribute...

08:26.589 --> 08:28.181
Pretty good. Textbook answer.

08:28.391 --> 08:31.417
You want to see some real Pedes cases,
come see me.

08:31.627 --> 08:33.822
- Mark.
- Elizabeth, Lucy Knight, third-year.

08:34.030 --> 08:36.658
Dr. Corday, Surgical Resident
in cowboy boots.

08:36.866 --> 08:39.960
Aren't they fabulous?
Had an interview in Denver.

08:40.169 --> 08:42.068
- How do you do?
- How was your trip?

08:42.270 --> 08:47.004
The interview was fine, the mountains
are lovely, but the city's flat.

08:47.210 --> 08:48.700
Don't let the Residents abuse you.

08:48.911 --> 08:51.402
You're here to learn,
not to be their servant.

08:51.647 --> 08:52.875
See you later, Mark.

08:53.082 --> 08:56.711
- Labs are back on that rule-out MI.
- Thanks, Lily.

08:56.986 --> 09:00.114
That's the lay of the land.
I'm gonna check on a patient.

09:00.323 --> 09:02.314
- What am I supposed to do?
- Grab a chart...

09:02.525 --> 09:04.959
...help someone out,
just jump right in.

09:07.530 --> 09:08.656
- Output?
- No pulse.

09:08.864 --> 09:11.833
- How many units are in?
- Four O-neg. Four type-specific.

09:12.034 --> 09:12.898
Last epi?

09:13.102 --> 09:15.036
Five mgs, three minutes ago.

09:16.005 --> 09:17.165
How long has he been down?

09:17.373 --> 09:19.534
- 25 minutes.
- Let's call it.

09:19.742 --> 09:22.609
All right. Time of death 8:49.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.040
Nice try, everybody.

09:24.947 --> 09:27.541
- I gotta get back upstairs.
- I'll handle the chart.

09:27.883 --> 09:29.043
You want to wrap?

09:29.252 --> 09:30.378
- I'll do it.
- See you.

09:32.188 --> 09:34.315
- Is that it?
- I gotta get the death kit.

09:34.523 --> 09:35.922
I'll show you how we do it.

09:57.613 --> 10:01.014
Excuse me. Somebody?

10:02.018 --> 10:03.679
His phone's ringing.

10:03.886 --> 10:05.319
His phone's ringing.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.016
Hello?

10:16.399 --> 10:19.857
No, I'm sorry. He can't come
to the phone right now.

10:22.171 --> 10:25.368
Well, yeah. I suppose
I could take a message.

10:27.443 --> 10:29.104
<i>Remember where Radiology is.</i>

10:30.479 --> 10:32.947
<i>Continue to your left now...</i>

10:33.382 --> 10:35.407
<i>... on down to the end of the hall.</i>

10:35.718 --> 10:38.186
<i>And proceed seven steps forward.</i>

10:38.387 --> 10:40.753
<i>You have now reached the Admit desk...</i>

10:40.956 --> 10:44.858
<i>... the veritable heartbeat</i>
<i>of every emergency room.</i>

10:47.463 --> 10:49.761
- This is not mine.
- What is with this thing?

10:49.965 --> 10:52.900
- I'm never where I'm supposed to be.
- Neither was I.

10:53.102 --> 10:56.299
When I saw you in Chairs, I was
supposed to be in the Suture Room.

10:56.505 --> 10:59.133
- Did we start at the wrong point?
- I know I have.

10:59.342 --> 11:01.037
I wanted Medicine rotation.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.768
Dr. Doyle's latched
on to me in a big way.

11:03.979 --> 11:05.810
We haven't been assigned
a Resident.

11:06.015 --> 11:08.779
Hasn't stopped her from using me
as a urine-delivery...

11:08.984 --> 11:10.451
Where is the lab?

11:10.653 --> 11:12.245
It wasn't where it should be.

11:12.455 --> 11:13.444
- Ms. Knight.
- See you.

11:13.656 --> 11:16.420
- Dr. Weaver.
- The tour's very helpful, isn't it?

11:16.625 --> 11:20.652
Yes, thank you. As Chief, will you be
the one assigning us to Residents?

11:20.863 --> 11:22.626
I'm Acting Chief.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.090
- Kerry?
- Doug, you were looking for me?

11:25.301 --> 11:27.861
I have to do an LP on
a 2-year-old boy in Exam 3.

11:28.070 --> 11:30.561
- Rule out meningitis?
- Yes.

11:30.806 --> 11:32.899
- What are the symptoms?
- Excuse us.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.073
Just a second.

11:36.612 --> 11:37.909
I'm not presenting a case.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.776
I'm telling you about a procedure
that needs to be done.

11:40.983 --> 11:43.349
The parents are waiting
if you would like to join us.

11:43.552 --> 11:48.546
Look, Don Anspaugh and Legal mandated
the terms of your situation, not me.

11:48.758 --> 11:51.556
Those terms do not include me
having to justify a procedure.

11:51.994 --> 11:53.518
Be right there!

11:54.797 --> 11:59.427
Why don't you grab Dr. Carter and see
if he can pull you in on patients?

12:04.507 --> 12:06.600
Can you hold this corner up?

12:06.809 --> 12:08.367
- Sure.
- Thanks.

12:08.577 --> 12:11.011
I'm getting ready
for my surprise birthday party.

12:11.213 --> 12:13.238
This year's surprise:
There is no party.

12:13.449 --> 12:15.474
Then why do you have
that cake in the lounge?

12:15.684 --> 12:18.084
- I didn't tell.
- He sniffs it out every year.

12:18.287 --> 12:20.152
Well, you hide it in the same place
every year.

12:20.356 --> 12:22.688
- Patient's 8.
- How long has he had the rash?

12:22.892 --> 12:26.089
Three weeks.
I'm having a hard time diagnosing it.

12:26.295 --> 12:28.286
- How's it going, Ms. Knight?
- Fine.

12:28.497 --> 12:31.557
Dr. Weaver suggested I work
with Dr. Carter.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.166
Carter, want to fill her in?

12:33.369 --> 12:37.999
Eight-year-old with erythematous
macules and small papules on the back.

12:38.207 --> 12:41.608
- What's the distribution?
- Kind of spread out like a fan.

12:41.811 --> 12:45.338
- Does it resemble a Christmas tree?
- Yeah, I guess you could say that.

12:45.548 --> 12:49.575
Sounds like pityriasis rosea. Classic
Christmas tree pattern on the back.

12:49.785 --> 12:52.151
- I think she's right.
- Using a computer.

12:53.722 --> 12:56.122
Why don't you let Dr. Ross
take a look?

12:56.325 --> 12:59.886
Then you and Ms. Knight can move
on to the gentleman with hematuria.

13:00.095 --> 13:01.392
Okay.

13:02.665 --> 13:04.895
- I'll meet you in Exam Four.
- Sure.

13:06.268 --> 13:07.701
Did I say the wrong thing?

13:08.204 --> 13:10.900
It's probably not a good idea
to show up the Residents.

13:11.106 --> 13:14.439
- So I should give the wrong answer?
- Tricky, isn't it?

13:14.643 --> 13:16.133
Welcome aboard.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.105
When did you first notice blood
in your urine?

13:19.315 --> 13:20.942
Just a couple days ago.

13:21.150 --> 13:22.981
Could it be related to exhaustion?

13:23.185 --> 13:26.052
I've been finishing this renovation
in Oak Park.

13:26.255 --> 13:29.452
- Working long hours?
- Need to bring it in.

13:29.658 --> 13:31.626
- I don't think that's it. Any fever?
- No.

13:31.827 --> 13:34.762
- Back pain?
- Well, just the usual from work.

13:36.665 --> 13:37.654
How about weight loss?

13:37.867 --> 13:39.835
I always drop at the end of a job.

13:40.035 --> 13:42.503
You know, you skip a meal
here and there.

13:43.138 --> 13:45.663
- Is it gonna be much longer?
- I'll order some tests.

13:45.875 --> 13:48.139
We'll know more then. Conni?

13:48.344 --> 13:51.711
Let's get a CBC, coag panel.
UA, Chem-7.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.905
- You got it.
- Peed in this cup for you.

13:54.116 --> 13:56.880
Thank you. We'll be back in a bit.

14:01.524 --> 14:03.924
Sorry about coming up with
that rash diagnosis before you.

14:04.126 --> 14:05.115
Fair is fair.

14:05.327 --> 14:07.522
I hope this doesn't mean
I won't get to do anything.

14:07.730 --> 14:10.062
I spent two years learning
how to do a physical.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.497
- I'm willing to help with patients.
- Carter? I'm jammed.

14:13.702 --> 14:17.035
Can you take Mrs. Lydell,
a foot ulcer, in Curtain Three?

14:17.239 --> 14:18.900
- Sure.
- Thanks.

14:21.944 --> 14:25.141
She's all yours. Do the H and P.
Make an assessment.

14:25.347 --> 14:27.008
And then come find me.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.012
- Mrs. Lydell?
- Yes, I surely am.

14:33.222 --> 14:34.314
I'm Lucy Knight.

14:34.523 --> 14:37.458
Is it okay if I check you over
and ask a few questions?

14:37.660 --> 14:40.527
Child, the good Lord has
put me into your hands.

14:40.729 --> 14:43.721
I receive you as He receives us both.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.530
- Order a C-spine and portable chest.
- Pelvis?

14:47.736 --> 14:49.033
- Dr. Carter?
- I'm busy.

14:49.238 --> 14:51.638
- The labs are back on Mr. Zwicki.
- Pulse ox is 92.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.604
- Put them in his chart.
- Get a large-bore IV going.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.607
- We need a central line.
- I'll do it.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.837
- His crit doesn't look good.
- I'll check it soon.

14:59.048 --> 15:01.915
- Go ahead, Carter. I've got it.
- No, really. It's okay.

15:02.418 --> 15:05.751
We're covered here.
Go on. Go, go, go!

15:12.728 --> 15:13.752
Hematocrit's 30?

15:13.963 --> 15:16.124
So he's pretty anemic, right?

15:16.332 --> 15:18.800
Urinalysis shows too many
red blood cells.

15:19.034 --> 15:22.629
- But only two to three WBCs.
- BUN and creatinine are normal.

15:22.838 --> 15:26.365
With the hematuria, we definitely need
to admit him for more tests.

15:26.575 --> 15:29.043
Can you give me the diagnosis
at this point?

15:29.244 --> 15:31.303
Without using the computer.

15:31.513 --> 15:35.313
With weight loss and painless
hematuria, cancer's high on the list.

15:35.517 --> 15:39.009
Kidney tumor, carcinoma of the
bladder, prostate cancer, renal...

15:39.221 --> 15:41.155
- Good job.
- Thanks.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.550
I was just coming to find you.
I gotta get going.

15:45.761 --> 15:48.753
My poor wife's been in that
waiting room for two hours.

15:48.964 --> 15:51.057
Mr. Zwicki, your lab results are back.

15:51.266 --> 15:54.633
And they indicate that
there may be a serious problem.

15:54.837 --> 15:57.829
We'd like to admit you
to do a full evaluation.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.975
No, I can't do that.
I start a renovation tomorrow.

16:01.176 --> 16:02.234
Townhouse.

16:02.444 --> 16:04.810
- I'm sure it could wait.
- No, it can't.

16:05.014 --> 16:09.883
Your condition could be very serious.
There's a possibility of cancer.

16:10.085 --> 16:12.451
I really think you should
get it checked out.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.149
Look, come on, now.

16:16.358 --> 16:20.886
A buddy found blood in his piss and
it turned out to be a urine infection.

16:21.096 --> 16:24.497
- Can't you give me some antibiotics?
- Can't really do that.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.569
We should bring your wife up to speed,
all right?

16:31.407 --> 16:33.875
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay. We'll be back.

16:37.279 --> 16:39.440
- You'd have to let him go?
- Lf he insists.

16:39.648 --> 16:43.709
You gotta know what technique to use
for him to stay: His wife.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.944
- Meaning?
- We give her the full picture:

16:46.155 --> 16:49.124
The possibility of cancer,
the importance of early detection.

16:49.324 --> 16:51.724
Ten minutes alone with him,
she'll change his mind.

16:51.927 --> 16:55.021
- Did Dr. Weaver do that central line?
- Just about to.

16:55.631 --> 16:58.361
I'm gonna go check with her,
see if she needs help.

17:01.036 --> 17:03.732
- I'm looking for Mrs. Zwicki.
- Yes.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.270
Mrs. Zwicki?

17:06.275 --> 17:10.405
My name is Lucy Knight and I'd like
to talk to you about your husband.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.978
His condition could be very serious.

17:13.582 --> 17:14.640
What do you mean?

17:15.349 --> 17:19.719
Well, with the hematuria there's
a chance of renal vein thrombosis...

17:19.922 --> 17:23.255
...polycystic kidney disease,
and renal or ureteral...

17:23.459 --> 17:25.222
Wait, I don't understand this.

17:25.761 --> 17:27.387
Your husband wants to leave AMA.

17:27.596 --> 17:29.587
We'd like to check him in
and do more tests.

17:29.798 --> 17:31.265
- Tests?!
- Do an IVP.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.334
Get an abdominal CT.
Check his urine for AFBs.

17:34.536 --> 17:37.232
Maybe check a PSA
and possibly do a cystoscopy.

17:37.439 --> 17:39.498
It would just be a couple of days.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.335
I think we're out this way.

17:41.543 --> 17:43.602
- What's going on?
- The Zwickis decided to leave.

17:43.812 --> 17:47.213
Mrs. Zwicki, I need to tell you
about your husband's condition.

17:47.416 --> 17:50.078
She explained everything.
He's incredibly stubborn!

17:50.285 --> 17:52.253
No, look, I am not stubborn.
I feel fine.

17:52.454 --> 17:54.115
I got a new job to start.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.850
Summer, that's when I get my work.
I can't blow this job off.

17:58.060 --> 17:59.357
No, I'll tell you what.

17:59.561 --> 18:02.553
If this doesn't
clear up, then I'll arrange...

18:02.765 --> 18:04.858
...to get with my regular doc, okay?

18:05.100 --> 18:07.330
It'll be okay.
Come on, let's go.

18:10.539 --> 18:12.700
- You talked to her?
- I thought you said...

18:12.908 --> 18:15.604
- What did you say?
- I told her about hypernephroma...

18:15.811 --> 18:17.836
...prostatic carcinoma...
- In those words?!

18:18.046 --> 18:19.035
Is there a problem?

18:19.248 --> 18:20.647
- Mark?
- Just a second, Carol.

18:20.849 --> 18:21.975
A patient wanted to leave.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.620
Ms. Knight explained his condition
in medical rather than layman terms.

18:25.821 --> 18:28.654
Why is a student explaining?
Where were you?

18:28.857 --> 18:31.451
I was assisting Dr. Weaver.
I didn't tell her to do it.

18:31.660 --> 18:33.184
- Yes, you did.
- I hate to break in.

18:33.395 --> 18:35.158
We've got a blunt head trauma.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.299
- You told me to explain.
- I didn't mean you!

18:41.637 --> 18:44.162
Ms. Knight, why don't you
come with us?

18:52.347 --> 18:55.578
27-year-old firefighter,
fell 20 feet onto concrete...

18:55.784 --> 18:58.082
...with blunt head trauma.

18:58.287 --> 19:01.154
BP 150/90. Pulse 60.

19:01.356 --> 19:03.187
Apneic and intubated on scene.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.622
Pupils four millimeters and sluggish.

19:05.828 --> 19:07.762
- You intubated?
- We lost the tube.

19:07.963 --> 19:09.760
We didn't have a laryngoscope.

19:09.965 --> 19:13.025
- Why the private chopper?
- It was on the scene.

19:25.814 --> 19:30.410
Help! Oh, no! Please, help me!
Please!

19:32.521 --> 19:33.681
Please!

19:49.238 --> 19:51.069
8.0 ET tube. Suction.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.833
BP's 160/95. Pulse 62.

19:54.042 --> 19:54.974
Pulse ox 92.

19:55.177 --> 19:57.168
- Stabilize the neck.
- What have we got?

19:57.379 --> 20:00.439
Emile Fernandez, 27-year-old
firefighter...

20:00.649 --> 20:02.583
...fell 20 feet onto concrete.

20:02.784 --> 20:06.276
- Head trauma, loss of consciousness.
- I'll check his belly.

20:06.488 --> 20:07.512
- Get locked out?
- Yes.

20:07.723 --> 20:09.213
Happened to me once.

20:09.424 --> 20:12.052
- Eighteen-gauge, left forearm.
- Okay, I'm in.

20:12.261 --> 20:13.728
- Good bowel sounds.
- Peritoneal lavage?

20:13.929 --> 20:17.626
No, he's hemodynamically stable.
Let's get a head and abdominal CT.

20:17.833 --> 20:20.825
All right. Pulse ox 92...

20:21.069 --> 20:23.367
...95, 96.

20:23.572 --> 20:27.303
Good breath sounds. No tracheal
shift or jugular venous distension.

20:27.509 --> 20:29.602
- Thank you, doctors.
- Call us when the CT's back.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.075
He needs a Foley and an NG tube.

20:32.281 --> 20:34.078
We thought you left on that chopper.

20:34.283 --> 20:35.944
- Sorry.
- First hemoglobin is 14.2.

20:36.151 --> 20:39.279
- Why don't you come over here?
- I need more tube.

20:39.922 --> 20:42.356
- He was a firefighter?
- He is a firefighter.

20:42.591 --> 20:46.789
- Urine's clear. No blood.
- Glasgow Coma Scale, how do you do it?

20:46.995 --> 20:49.589
Check for eye-opening,
verbal activity, motor response.

20:49.798 --> 20:52.028
- CT's ready.
- No verbal with ET.

20:52.234 --> 20:53.599
- Anything in the field?
- No.

20:53.802 --> 20:56.168
That would be a one.
What about eye opening?

20:56.371 --> 20:58.464
Spontaneous eye-opening is a five.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.835
We definitely don't have that.

21:01.043 --> 21:04.706
Emile, open your eyes!
Emile, open your eyes!

21:04.913 --> 21:06.904
- Now what?
- Painful stimulus.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.410
No eye-opening with pain.
That's a one.

21:11.620 --> 21:13.884
- How much for decorticate posturing?
- Two.

21:14.656 --> 21:18.922
That would be four out of 15.
He gets a three for being alive.

21:19.127 --> 21:20.924
Pulse ox, 98. ABG.

21:22.297 --> 21:25.824
- Absent corneal reflex means?
- No brainstem activity.

21:26.034 --> 21:27.524
Ready for the C-spine.

21:29.738 --> 21:30.727
Back up.

21:31.974 --> 21:35.171
- What are you thinking?
- Subdural or an epidural hematoma.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.174
Something we could actually fix.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.939
- What if there's no bleeding?
- Brain swelling.

21:40.148 --> 21:44.915
We'd have a chronic vegetative state
or a potential organ donor.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.918
Dr. Greene, Captain Matson.

21:48.123 --> 21:49.886
The guys want to know, how he's doing?

21:50.092 --> 21:53.755
Well, it's too early to say.
We'll know more when the CT's back.

21:53.962 --> 21:56.453
We screwed up bringing him
in on that chopper.

21:56.665 --> 21:58.394
It was the fastest way.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.864
Yeah, but we lost his ET tube.
We didn't have equipment.

22:01.069 --> 22:03.936
If you'd waited, it could've
been another 15 minutes.

22:04.139 --> 22:05.868
We would've had more supplies.

22:06.074 --> 22:09.669
You didn't screw anything up.
You bagged him, kept the airway open.

22:09.878 --> 22:12.346
I probably would've done
the same thing.

22:13.882 --> 22:16.442
- Any family?
- Wife and two kids.

22:17.619 --> 22:18.608
Thanks, doc.

22:21.823 --> 22:25.224
- You didn't tell them his condition.
- I don't know what that is yet.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.626
You're right. I didn't tell them.

22:27.829 --> 22:31.560
Why don't you stick with me on this?
I'll call you when the CT comes back.

22:33.869 --> 22:37.327
- We should have the cake at the desk.
- No surprise in that.

22:37.539 --> 22:39.530
We could put it in an exam room.

22:39.741 --> 22:42.869
- Didn't we do that last year?
- The last two years.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.103
- Kind of noisy, huh?
- There's no place to work.

22:46.314 --> 22:48.339
No, but at least you get a locker.

22:48.550 --> 22:50.484
I didn't get one for two months.

22:50.685 --> 22:54.143
Yeah, I guess some Resident
left the program or something.

22:54.356 --> 22:56.256
Right. Dr. Del Amico.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.120
She went to Philadelphia
to work in the pediatric ER.

22:59.327 --> 23:00.817
We don't have one?

23:01.797 --> 23:04.197
We might get one
if Dr. Ross has his way.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.031
Anyway, Anna... Dr. Del Amico...

23:08.236 --> 23:10.101
...thought it was
a better opportunity.

23:10.705 --> 23:13.799
Her family's there.
It's where she's from.

23:14.776 --> 23:18.712
There was this boyfriend
that she was involved with.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.774
You got a locker out of it.

23:23.985 --> 23:26.283
I'm sorry about Mr. Zwicki.

23:27.422 --> 23:29.720
I thought you asked me
to talk to his wife.

23:33.395 --> 23:36.193
Sometimes the Suture Room
is pretty quiet.

23:39.301 --> 23:41.792
Baker, Shelly, chart number 13940...

23:42.003 --> 23:45.336
...admitted January 12, 1998,
with a fever of 102.

23:45.540 --> 23:47.269
Respiratory distress...

23:47.476 --> 23:49.842
It's been a crazy day.
I've been swamped.

23:50.045 --> 23:51.672
Reece couldn't get the hearing test?

23:51.880 --> 23:54.713
No, no, no. He had an ear infection.

23:54.916 --> 23:58.181
- That's probably been the cause.
- That's good anyway.

23:58.386 --> 24:00.547
He'll be on Augmentin
for another week.

24:00.755 --> 24:03.189
Then he'll take the test
and clear this up.

24:07.629 --> 24:08.618
What?

24:08.830 --> 24:11.526
I can't believe you're wearing
those boots.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.997
When in Rome...

24:17.105 --> 24:18.572
How was Rome?

24:19.241 --> 24:21.675
Denver is not Rome.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.573
I went to a fantastic rodeo, though.

24:24.779 --> 24:27.373
I didn't care for the hospital.
It's regimented.

24:27.649 --> 24:29.776
Well, it is a Surgical program.

24:29.985 --> 24:32.146
Look, I want to stay in Chicago.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.451
You know, Cromley may offer me
a sponsorship.

24:36.124 --> 24:37.148
Good.

24:37.759 --> 24:40.159
I'm glad you're staying.

24:40.362 --> 24:42.660
Well, trying to stay.

24:43.131 --> 24:45.725
- You are, are you?
- Yeah.

24:48.470 --> 24:49.459
I missed you.

24:50.572 --> 24:54.235
Well, that's very nice of you
to say, Peter.

24:54.442 --> 24:55.807
I missed you too.

24:57.412 --> 25:00.643
- It was a little...
- Cold between the sheets.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.118
Elizabeth, what are you doing?

25:07.556 --> 25:10.821
Stop being so shocked
and come over here.

25:29.144 --> 25:33.240
- Has it been six months?
- It seems like it, doesn't it?

25:42.390 --> 25:43.516
Lucy, right?

25:44.960 --> 25:45.949
Yeah.

25:47.128 --> 25:50.154
- And you are?
- Malik. Carter was looking for you.

25:50.365 --> 25:52.492
He's checking on that pregnant lady
in Exam Two.

25:52.701 --> 25:53.725
Thanks.

26:00.075 --> 26:02.202
Exam Two...

26:04.145 --> 26:06.045
- Exam Two?
- No, Curtain Three.

26:06.248 --> 26:09.081
- Exam Two is back towards Admit.
- Thanks.

26:12.020 --> 26:15.183
- Exam Two?
- Past Curtain Two, hang a left.

26:15.390 --> 26:18.223
Exam... Curtain Two. Exam Two.

26:21.796 --> 26:24.765
- Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Are you the doctor?

26:25.333 --> 26:29.030
No. I'm Lucy Knight.
I'll be assisting the doctor.

26:30.972 --> 26:32.234
Who'll be here soon.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.679
Hi, Mrs. Draper. I'm Dr. Carter.

26:45.887 --> 26:47.912
You're about nine weeks pregnant?

26:48.123 --> 26:50.557
This is my third pregnancy.

26:50.992 --> 26:53.483
Mrs. Draper's had two previous
miscarriages.

26:55.163 --> 26:59.259
I see that you've been experiencing
some cramping and some bleeding.

26:59.467 --> 27:03.494
Spotting. I had some spotting
yesterday and it's heavier today.

27:03.738 --> 27:06.298
And I passed some clots.

27:06.508 --> 27:09.033
BP's 110/75. Pulse 100.

27:09.944 --> 27:11.605
And how many pads have you used?

27:12.614 --> 27:15.174
One yesterday and four today.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.748
- Have any fever?
- No.

27:16.951 --> 27:18.646
- Any burning on urination?
- No.

27:18.920 --> 27:19.909
Good.

27:20.155 --> 27:22.919
Let's get a CBC, type and RH...

27:23.124 --> 27:25.718
...dip a urine, and check an ICON.

27:25.927 --> 27:28.157
Are there any family members
we can call?

27:30.165 --> 27:33.430
- I've already talked to my husband.
- Okay.

27:34.536 --> 27:36.094
We're gonna do a few tests...

27:36.304 --> 27:38.602
...then I'll come back
and do a pelvic exam.

27:38.807 --> 27:41.742
Then we'll know better
where we stand. Okay?

27:42.043 --> 27:44.034
- Okay.
- We'll be right back.

27:46.715 --> 27:48.615
Tell me when the ICON's back.

27:48.817 --> 27:50.978
I should stay out while you
do the pelvic, right?

27:51.186 --> 27:52.551
Won't learn much if you do.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.346
I thought she seemed distraught.

27:54.556 --> 27:57.616
It doesn't have anything to do
with you being in the room.

27:57.826 --> 28:00.693
The CT's back on that firefighter
if you want to see.

28:00.895 --> 28:02.419
- Let me put my stuff down.
- Sure.

28:02.630 --> 28:06.327
Okay, tell me what you see.
Any intracranial bleeding?

28:07.001 --> 28:10.334
I'll give you a hint.
Blood appears white on a CT scan.

28:10.538 --> 28:14.133
- I don't see any.
- No subdural or epidural hematoma.

28:14.342 --> 28:16.572
There's nothing
they can do surgically.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.076
- That's not good?
- That's not good at all.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.269
Look at the ventricles.

28:20.482 --> 28:23.474
The brain is so swollen
that they're squashed down...

28:23.685 --> 28:25.744
...along the border
of the gray matter.

28:25.954 --> 28:30.823
Tiny, punctate hemorrhages
and axonal shearing.

28:31.693 --> 28:33.183
Most of his brain's been destroyed.

28:33.395 --> 28:36.796
- So, what do you do now?
- Give steroids, hyperventilate him.

28:36.998 --> 28:39.796
Have Neurosurgery put in an ICP
monitor and wait for the wife.

28:40.001 --> 28:41.195
Dr. Greene?

28:42.971 --> 28:44.905
- Not too good, is it?
- No.

28:45.707 --> 28:49.006
Thanks for talking with us. The
captain and I get into it sometimes.

28:49.210 --> 28:51.075
- Turf war?
- I hate to call it that.

28:51.279 --> 28:54.646
You must have worked
with paramedics in the field before.

28:54.849 --> 28:57.443
- Mostly in here.
- Want to think about doing it?

28:57.652 --> 29:00.883
There's a position open.
District medical director for EMS.

29:01.089 --> 29:05.082
- What exactly is that?
- Oversee paramedic education.

29:05.293 --> 29:07.158
Help determine new procedures.

29:08.062 --> 29:09.689
- I have a job.
- This is a side deal.

29:09.898 --> 29:12.332
- Only a few hours a week.
- It can't be much pay.

29:12.834 --> 29:13.823
Pay's nothing.

29:14.035 --> 29:16.094
- And the perks?
- There aren't any.

29:16.304 --> 29:19.034
No salary, no perks.
Sounds great.

29:19.641 --> 29:20.630
See you.

29:24.779 --> 29:26.713
Hell of a way to get a job offer.

29:29.117 --> 29:31.608
<i>And proceed seven steps forward.</i>

29:31.820 --> 29:34.380
<i>You have now reached the Admit desk...</i>

29:34.589 --> 29:37.581
- You already took the audio tour.
- Yeah, I know.

29:37.792 --> 29:40.784
- Dr. Doyle doesn't know that.
- Bernard, you owe me.

29:40.995 --> 29:43.429
Okay... Okay.

29:43.965 --> 29:46.160
How many times is he gonna
take that thing?

29:47.302 --> 29:49.600
Hey, Carter's about to do that pelvic.

29:52.574 --> 29:55.134
I'm gonna take a look inside
with the speculum.

29:55.343 --> 29:57.277
I need you to relax.

30:07.722 --> 30:10.919
There's tissue in the os.
Ring forceps.

30:17.966 --> 30:19.627
Let's get that to Pathology.

30:24.939 --> 30:27.203
I need to check your ovaries now.

30:27.408 --> 30:28.898
You tell me...

30:30.078 --> 30:31.511
...is there any pain here?

30:33.147 --> 30:34.273
No.

30:36.417 --> 30:38.942
- How about here?
- No.

30:40.154 --> 30:42.145
No adnexal masses or tenderness.

30:42.357 --> 30:44.951
You can put your legs back down,
Mrs. Draper.

30:45.627 --> 30:48.221
What is it? What's going on?

30:50.431 --> 30:53.298
I am very sorry, but you have
had a miscarriage.

30:58.540 --> 30:59.529
You're sure?

31:01.009 --> 31:03.307
The fetus was pushed out of the womb.

31:06.281 --> 31:09.944
Your bleeding has slowed, but we need
to observe you for a little while.

31:10.285 --> 31:14.051
I'm gonna come back
and do another pelvic exam...

31:14.255 --> 31:16.655
...to make sure
the bleeding's stopped...

31:16.858 --> 31:20.259
...and that the cervix is closed.

31:21.095 --> 31:24.064
A doctor from OB/GYN
is gonna stop by.

31:24.632 --> 31:27.533
Ms. Knight, would you stay here
until they do?

31:28.603 --> 31:29.797
Of course.

31:30.371 --> 31:32.362
Get some rest, Mrs. Draper.

31:32.907 --> 31:33.896
Rest.

31:40.181 --> 31:43.241
I thought this time
it would be all right.

31:43.651 --> 31:46.176
I never made it to nine weeks before.

31:50.658 --> 31:52.956
I don't know why this is happening.

31:55.263 --> 31:56.992
Why is this happening?

32:00.435 --> 32:01.527
I don't know.

32:04.072 --> 32:05.266
I'm sorry.

32:07.408 --> 32:08.397
I don't know.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.178
- What are you doing?
- I have no idea.

32:14.382 --> 32:15.849
- Ms. Knight?
- Yes. Hi.

32:16.050 --> 32:19.019
I just thought we could...
Just excuse me a minute.

32:21.589 --> 32:24.581
Jerry, I thought you notified
the morgue for a pickup.

32:24.792 --> 32:27.283
I did. I'm sorry,
I'll call them again.

32:27.495 --> 32:30.191
I haven't had a chance
to work with you today.

32:30.398 --> 32:33.526
- Everything's going well?
- Yes, pretty well for a first day.

32:33.735 --> 32:35.498
So it's been completely hateful.

32:35.703 --> 32:39.503
Kerry, I need to do a needle
aspiration on a 15-year-old.

32:39.707 --> 32:40.867
I need the mother's consent.

32:41.075 --> 32:44.602
Yeah, and Ms. Knight was looking
for a good case to observe.

32:44.812 --> 32:46.370
The more the merrier. Come on.

32:47.882 --> 32:51.147
You see, now,
that's a peritonsillar abscess.

32:51.352 --> 32:55.379
A pocket of pus has collected around
the tonsils and we have to get it out.

32:55.590 --> 33:00.527
We'll numb it first and we'll use a
needle to draw out the infected fluid.

33:01.162 --> 33:05.258
An alternative is to open it with
a scalpel, but that's more invasive.

33:05.466 --> 33:08.697
- The needle aspiration is fine.
- Lf you're sure.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.609
You've been a "hit the books"
medical student.

33:21.816 --> 33:25.912
- Is there any other kind?
- Some are more diligent than I was.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.389
You're a Pediatric Emergency Fellow?

33:28.589 --> 33:30.955
- It's different from an Attending?
- Under the boss.

33:31.159 --> 33:33.719
That's why you need an Attending
to be your witness?

33:34.495 --> 33:38.727
When you have parents sign consents
an Attending needs to witness that.

33:39.434 --> 33:43.803
I performed a procedure on a
7-month-old baby addicted to heroin.

33:44.005 --> 33:45.939
I didn't get his mother's consent.

33:46.140 --> 33:48.734
- What happened?
- The powers that be were upset.

33:48.943 --> 33:52.970
So I am now a Pediatric Emergency
Fellow on probation.

33:53.181 --> 33:55.547
And the baby isn't addicted to drugs.

33:55.750 --> 33:57.684
Sometimes it's a tradeoff.

33:57.885 --> 33:59.182
Good luck.

33:59.821 --> 34:01.914
Every guy in that gym
thought I had a coronary.

34:02.156 --> 34:03.885
They were all over me.

34:04.092 --> 34:06.526
Asking me if they could help,
get me some water.

34:06.728 --> 34:09.253
One guy offered to take me
to his own doctor.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.623
That's very generous.

34:10.831 --> 34:11.992
What do we have?

34:12.199 --> 34:14.225
Roxanne Please, 25.
She was at the gym...

34:14.435 --> 34:18.063
You know, I dropped a darn
15-pound weight on my little toe.

34:18.272 --> 34:19.500
I hope it's not broken.

34:19.706 --> 34:23.234
- Jerry, what's open?
- Curtain Area One.

34:24.245 --> 34:27.146
Or maybe Exam One would be better.

34:27.348 --> 34:29.009
We'll check it out and get an x-ray.

34:29.217 --> 34:31.583
A woman's looking for you.
A Mrs. Fernandez.

34:31.786 --> 34:32.717
The firefighter's wife.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.946
- We'll get you in the exam...
- I can take care of that.

34:36.190 --> 34:38.920
Okay, Jerry.
It is your birthday, so...

34:39.127 --> 34:42.255
- Really? Happy birthday.
- Well, thank you.

34:46.199 --> 34:47.667
- Mrs. Fernandez?
- Yes?

34:47.869 --> 34:50.132
I'm Dr. Greene. This is Ms. Knight.

34:50.338 --> 34:54.797
Where's Emile? We came as soon
as we could. We piled in the car.

34:55.009 --> 34:58.911
It'd probably be a good idea
if the family stayed here.

35:07.255 --> 35:11.988
Mrs. Fernandez, your husband fell
20 feet onto a concrete surface.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.593
The paramedics were there
and brought him right in.

35:14.796 --> 35:17.162
There was no internal
abdominal bleeding.

35:17.365 --> 35:21.461
The CT scan of his head showed
diffuse brain injury and swelling.

35:21.669 --> 35:23.364
What does that mean?
How serious?

35:24.305 --> 35:27.672
He can't breathe on his own.
He's on a ventilator.

35:28.209 --> 35:32.407
He can't move any muscles.
He's not opening his eyes.

35:32.613 --> 35:34.171
He's in a coma.

35:35.149 --> 35:36.912
Does he need an operation?

35:37.985 --> 35:40.647
Unfortunately, there isn't any
that can help.

35:41.088 --> 35:43.181
The prognosis is not good.

35:43.791 --> 35:47.989
We're going to admit him to the ICU,
monitor the pressure in his brain...

35:48.196 --> 35:50.596
...and treat the swelling
the best we can.

35:56.137 --> 35:58.230
Is he brain-dead, Dr. Greene?

35:59.740 --> 36:01.935
We're gonna have to wait and see.

36:05.012 --> 36:09.540
If the tests show no brain activity
over the next few days...

36:10.585 --> 36:15.181
...you're gonna have to think
about continuing life support.

36:34.508 --> 36:38.342
Lucy, can you take Mrs. Fernandez
to see her husband?

36:43.417 --> 36:45.351
Can he hear anything?

36:46.053 --> 36:50.046
It's possible. There's no way
to really know.

37:43.778 --> 37:45.302
You can talk to him.

37:55.623 --> 37:57.250
Do you know what you cut your foot on?

37:57.458 --> 38:01.690
No. I was diving the Wellsburt,
a shipwreck out in Lake Michigan...

38:02.363 --> 38:04.297
...when I felt this slice.

38:04.498 --> 38:06.523
What's weird, though, at that depth...

38:06.734 --> 38:08.895
...your blood comes out looking green.

38:09.103 --> 38:11.128
- When was your last tetanus shot?
- I don't know.

38:11.339 --> 38:13.432
My mom kept track of that stuff.

38:13.708 --> 38:17.166
Your laceration is superficial,
but it'll require a few stitches.

38:17.411 --> 38:20.608
We'll give you a dose
of antibiotics beforehand.

38:21.215 --> 38:24.412
Ms. Knight, do you think
you can handle the IV?

38:25.286 --> 38:27.379
- Of course.
- I'll be back.

38:39.033 --> 38:40.398
You do know how to do this?

38:41.168 --> 38:42.499
Yes.

38:47.708 --> 38:50.302
Oh, could I ask you something
for a second?

38:50.511 --> 38:51.500
Sure.

38:52.546 --> 38:54.036
This is my first IV and l...

38:54.248 --> 38:55.875
You don't want to punish the patient.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.072
Something like that.

38:57.284 --> 38:58.979
- Okay.
- Thank you.

39:00.121 --> 39:02.521
- Do you want to try?
- No, I'll just watch.

39:02.723 --> 39:03.815
All right.

39:04.358 --> 39:09.091
First you're gonna take the tourniquet
and tie it into a slipknot, like that.

39:12.633 --> 39:16.467
Ms. Knight, the films came back
on that woman who dropped the weight.

39:16.670 --> 39:20.231
Small, non-displaced fracture
of the proximal phalanx.

39:20.875 --> 39:24.174
- Fifth toe. Just do a buddy tape.
- A buddy tape?

39:24.645 --> 39:27.546
Yeah, you tape the little toe
to the one next to it. Okay?

39:27.748 --> 39:30.512
Tell her to expect discomfort
for a couple of weeks...

39:30.718 --> 39:32.618
...and to wear hard-soled shoes.

39:32.820 --> 39:33.844
Okay.

39:34.722 --> 39:38.783
When you look at the actuarial tables,
term is definitely the way to go.

39:39.427 --> 39:42.089
- Ms. Please.
- Oh, please, call me Roxanne.

39:42.296 --> 39:43.695
I've said that my whole life.

39:43.898 --> 39:46.765
Good news. It's just
a small hairline fracture.

39:46.967 --> 39:49.231
- How long will that take to heal?
- A couple of weeks.

39:49.637 --> 39:53.835
I need to tape you up.
And you should wear hard-soled shoes.

39:54.041 --> 39:56.202
- Roxanne sells insurance.
- Really?

39:56.410 --> 40:00.437
Yep. Life, disability,
umbrella policies, you name it.

40:01.949 --> 40:05.817
- You have insurance?
- Just medical through school.

40:06.620 --> 40:07.814
Sorry.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.955
You should start your coverage now.
Your age, premiums are incredibly low.

40:12.159 --> 40:15.151
Roxanne says disability
is more important than life.

40:15.863 --> 40:20.823
Statistically, you're more likely
to be maimed or mutilated than killed.

40:21.035 --> 40:22.662
Really? Who knew?

40:23.370 --> 40:26.703
- Roxanne's also staying for the party.
- What party?

40:27.341 --> 40:30.310
Jerry's surprise party.
He says they always have one.

40:30.511 --> 40:33.036
Okay. There we go.

40:33.581 --> 40:35.242
That should do it.

40:36.450 --> 40:40.318
Scuba Man is on his way.
Only took half a dozen sutures.

40:41.722 --> 40:45.658
- By the way, nice job on that IV.
- Good.

40:45.860 --> 40:49.227
No, seriously. I kind of threw you
in the deep end there.

40:49.430 --> 40:52.524
I didn't think you'd be able to do it.
It's good to know...

40:52.733 --> 40:54.564
...you can swim.
- Thanks.

40:54.768 --> 40:56.633
- Can I see you for a minute?
- Sure.

40:56.837 --> 40:59.635
Mrs. Fernandez is looking
for either you or Dr. Greene.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.000
Okay.

41:02.643 --> 41:04.975
Mrs. Fernandez, can I help you?

41:05.179 --> 41:08.774
I couldn't stay in with Emile.
I...

41:09.283 --> 41:12.047
I can't see him that way.
I can't talk to him.

41:12.853 --> 41:14.912
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to be sorry.

41:15.122 --> 41:17.249
Look, I need to take my children home.

41:17.958 --> 41:21.223
Tell Dr. Greene that
I will come back tomorrow.

41:21.428 --> 41:23.760
And I guess we'll talk
about what to do.

41:23.964 --> 41:25.556
Okay. Okay, I'll tell him.

41:30.271 --> 41:33.570
Jerry! Jerry, get over here, please.

41:33.774 --> 41:36.004
I mean what does it take, huh?

41:36.210 --> 41:38.974
How many times have I asked you
to get rid of this body?

41:39.180 --> 41:42.149
- I will call them again, Dr. Weaver.
- You will not!

41:42.349 --> 41:46.479
You will not call them again. You'll
take this poor soul there yourself.

41:46.687 --> 41:48.746
- Dr. Weaver...
- Jerry, it's just a corpse.

41:48.956 --> 41:51.652
It's not like you've never seen
a dead body before.

42:11.045 --> 42:14.913
- We finally got you at last!
- You got me. You got me.

42:15.115 --> 42:16.810
- Blow out the candles.
- All right.

42:17.017 --> 42:19.281
- Happy birthday, Jerry.
- Thanks.

42:20.387 --> 42:24.016
- I gotta pick up Rachel.
- Bring her to our barbecue.

42:24.225 --> 42:27.388
- Really? About an hour?
- Yeah.

42:28.195 --> 42:31.130
- Maimed or mutilated, huh?
- Yeah, it's not a pretty picture.

42:31.332 --> 42:32.321
No, tell me more.

42:32.533 --> 42:35.001
I can't believe this party.
It was a horrible day.

42:35.202 --> 42:39.536
Tomorrow's gonna be even worse. I
found out I got assigned to Dr. Doyle.

42:39.740 --> 42:42.072
- When did you hear that?
- Dr. Weaver told me.

42:42.276 --> 42:44.176
- You're with Dr. Carter.
- Oh, man.

42:44.378 --> 42:46.505
I'd consider yourself lucky.

42:47.314 --> 42:48.679
He thinks I can swim.

42:49.683 --> 42:51.241
At least we survived day one.

42:51.585 --> 42:54.816
Yeah, I basically did nothing
and helped no one.

42:55.022 --> 42:56.512
You got to see some patients.

42:56.724 --> 42:58.954
Dr. Doyle won't let me near
a single one.

42:59.860 --> 43:01.259
Yeah, I saw some patients.

43:01.462 --> 43:02.588
Want a piece of cake?

43:43.804 --> 43:45.499
Mr. Fernandez.

43:46.440 --> 43:47.429
Emile.

43:49.777 --> 43:52.075
My name is Lucy. I work here.

43:55.316 --> 43:56.840
I met your wife.

44:02.589 --> 44:04.989
I know how much she loves you.

44:06.026 --> 44:08.153
And how much your kids love you.

44:11.231 --> 44:13.893
And how they wish
this hadn't happened to you.

44:17.705 --> 44:20.367
How we all wish
this hadn't happened to you.
