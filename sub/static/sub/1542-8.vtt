TO ACCEPT THE POST.

41:09.087 --> 41:11.009
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

41:11.009 --> 41:13.141
WE CAN TALK MORE THEN.

41:13.141 --> 41:16.094
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
I WILL SEE YOU SOON.

41:16.094 --> 41:18.186
[ KEYPAD BEEPS ]

41:18.186 --> 41:19.648
GOOD. GO.
OH, I'M GOING.

41:19.648 --> 41:20.859
NO. I MEAN IT.

41:20.859 --> 41:22.601
GO NOW.

41:22.601 --> 41:26.605
AND IT ALL FEELS LIKE
ONE LONG, INESCAPABLE MOMENT.

41:26.605 --> 41:27.906
GO.

41:29.197 --> 41:31.409
SO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

41:31.409 --> 41:32.410
RICHARD!

41:32.410 --> 41:33.992
WHAT DO WE TAKE AWAY?

41:36.575 --> 41:39.077
WHICH PIECES WILL HAUNT US?

41:39.077 --> 41:43.211
I WAS...JEALOUS.

41:43.211 --> 41:44.462
SO I RUINED IT.

41:44.462 --> 41:45.674
HURT US?

41:45.674 --> 41:47.756
Ellis: RICHARD!

41:49.838 --> 41:53.842
END US?

41:53.842 --> 41:55.513
INSPIRE US?

41:55.513 --> 42:00.438
HE'S VERY DREAMY.
BUT HE IS NOT THE SUN.

42:00.438 --> 42:01.980
YOU ARE.

42:01.980 --> 42:04.643
IT'S JUST LIKE
MY MOTHER USED TO SAY --

42:04.643 --> 42:06.855
THE CAROUSEL
NEVER STOPS TURNING.

42:12.200 --> 42:14.863
YOU CAN'T GET OFF.
