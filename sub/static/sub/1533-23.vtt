00:07.160 --> 00:11.131
BARRY: <i>My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:11.960 --> 00:16.409
<i>When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.</i>

00:16.560 --> 00:19.404
<i>My father went to prison for her murder.</i>

00:19.560 --> 00:22.370
<i>Then an accident
made me the impossible.</i>

00:22.760 --> 00:26.810
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...</i>

00:27.000 --> 00:32.006
<i>...but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime
and find others like me.</i>

00:32.200 --> 00:36.728
<i>And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.</i>

00:37.160 --> 00:38.844
<i>That day is today.</i>

00:43.600 --> 00:44.931
What?

00:45.160 --> 00:46.321
No Big Belly Burger?

00:46.520 --> 00:48.841
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

00:49.040 --> 00:52.931
We're out of cows where I come from.
You don't care about that. You have questions.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.084
I'm not sure where to start.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.407
Thawne.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.204
That is your real name?

00:58.400 --> 01:00.368
- Eobard Thawne?
-Since the day I was born.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.291
- When was that?
-One hundred and thirty-six years from now.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.727
This is not what you wanna know.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.568
Go ahead, Barry.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.127
Ask it.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.450
Why did you kill my mother?

01:15.120 --> 01:16.406
Because I hate you.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.087
Not you now.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.520
You years from now.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.286
- In the future.
-In a future, yes.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.762
We're enemies, rivals, opposites.
Reverses of one another.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.564
Why? Why were enemies?

01:27.760 --> 01:29.285
It doesn't matter.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.964
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.091
What matters is neither of us
was strong enough to defeat the other.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.120
Until I learned your secret.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.721
I learned your name.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.400
Barry Allen.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.491
And finally, I knew how to defeat you
once and for all.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.325
Travel back in time, kill you as a child...

01:53.880 --> 01:56.360
...wipe you from the face of the earth.

01:56.560 --> 02:02.329
But then you, future you, that is,
followed me back and we fought.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.291
<i>WELLS:
We both landed some pretty solid shots.</i>

02:06.400 --> 02:10.166
And then you, future you,
got your younger self out of there.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.766
I was so mad.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.602
But then I thought...

02:18.800 --> 02:20.882
...what if you were to suffer a tragedy?

02:22.320 --> 02:27.201
What if you were to suffer something
so horrible, so traumatic...

02:27.360 --> 02:31.126
...that your child self could never recover?
Then you would not become the Flash.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.044
So I stabbed your mother in the heart.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.367
WELLS: And <i>I</i> was <i>free.</i>

02:36.040 --> 02:40.284
Finally able to return to a future
without the Flash.

02:40.480 --> 02:45.486
Only to realize that in traveling back,
I lost my way home.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.929
Lost my ability to harness the Speed Force.

02:50.360 --> 02:55.048
And without it,
I was stuck here, stranded in this time...

02:55.200 --> 03:00.889
...unable to return to my home,
and the only one way back was the Flash.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.927
But the Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.931
Why train me?

03:12.080 --> 03:15.004
Why help me save so many people?

03:15.200 --> 03:18.090
Because I needed you to get fast.

03:18.480 --> 03:25.011
Fast enough to rupture the space-time barrier
and create a stable Wormhole...

03:25.200 --> 03:27.089
...through which I could return home.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.605
Why would I ever do that?

03:29.760 --> 03:32.889
Because, Barry Allen...

03:33.080 --> 03:35.765
...if you give me what I want...

03:36.960 --> 03:38.689
...I'm gonna give you what you want.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.481
You can go back and save your mother.

03:44.080 --> 03:47.129
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.603
You can reunite the Allen family.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.405
No.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.085
No, I don't believe you.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.761
I wanna kill you right now.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.121
I know that rage.

04:04.360 --> 04:07.091
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.481
And now somehow...

04:10.800 --> 04:14.771
...I know what Joe and Henry feel...

04:15.920 --> 04:17.887
...when they look on you with pride.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.446
With love.

04:20.640 --> 04:24.486
No. No, don't you ever say that to me.

04:24.640 --> 04:28.122
I know you're upset,
but I'm giving you a chance.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.963
I'm giving you a chance
to undo all the evil I've done.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.001
Don't you want that chance?

04:52.080 --> 04:55.687
A rare opportunity to go back in time
and right a wrong...

04:55.840 --> 04:58.241
...and save your mother's life.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.323
Quite the paradox
Harrison has presented you with, Mr. Allen.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.000
The chance to be with someone you love?

05:05.160 --> 05:06.844
Seems pretty cut-and-dry to me.

05:07.040 --> 05:13.844
At first blush, Dr. Snow, it would appear so,
but this gift has unparalleled risk.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.208
Barry, the night your mother died...

05:17.360 --> 05:20.330
...the night you saved yourself
from being killed...

05:20.520 --> 05:25.731
...that event altered the timeline you were
already on, and changed the course of history.

05:25.960 --> 05:29.646
So, what you're saying is
we're living in a parallel universe?

05:29.840 --> 05:34.323
- Just like when I time-traveled before.
-But he only changed one day that time.

05:34.560 --> 05:39.726
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

05:39.960 --> 05:44.522
One different decision, no matter how
big or small, impacts everything that follows.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.850
Moments upon moments,
choices upon choices, new relationships.

05:49.040 --> 05:53.602
Nothing would be as it is today,
and you'd never know the difference...

05:53.800 --> 05:56.724
...because you'd never remember any of it.

05:58.920 --> 06:05.121
So if I go back and save my mom,
my dad doesn't go to prison.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.408
I never live with Joe and Iris.

06:10.720 --> 06:15.851
You might never meet me
or Caitlin or Ronnie.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.087
STEIN:
Truth is...

06:18.920 --> 06:23.721
...there's no real way of knowing
what your life will be.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.366
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.767
You gotta change the past.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.450
Joe.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.286
So, what, that's it?

06:46.440 --> 06:49.603
You think I should just do it?

06:50.720 --> 06:53.724
Yeah, I do.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.010
Which means
I will never come to live with you...

06:57.160 --> 06:58.685
...and you're okay with that?

06:59.920 --> 07:03.402
Barry, you get the chance to grow up
with both parents.

07:03.600 --> 07:07.571
- You don't have to grow up without a mother.
-What about growing up without a father?

07:07.760 --> 07:10.445
You will have a father. Your real father.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.964
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

07:16.200 --> 07:19.283
This is why you became the Flash, Barry.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.404
To put things right.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.483
You saved a lot of people's lives
this past year.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.328
Now it's time to save yours.

07:48.440 --> 07:52.331
BARRY:
Dad, look, I know this sounds crazy.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.847
I think we're way past crazy, slugger.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.289
Look, you're fast, I get it,
but turning back time--

07:59.480 --> 08:04.771
I wouldn't be turning time back.
I would be going back.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.765
To that night, to save her.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.044
What does Joe think about all this?

08:12.360 --> 08:13.885
He thinks I should do it.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.247
No.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.046
You can't.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.490
Dad...

08:24.240 --> 08:29.167
I can make it so
that night will never have happened.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.051
- We'll be a family again.
-We are a family.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.485
Not like this, not without Mom.

08:35.679 --> 08:39.765
Barry, there's a natural order to things.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.280
Okay, things happen the way they do.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.166
We may not know why at the time,
but there must always be a reason.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.887
Now, I believe that. I've had to believe it.

08:50.080 --> 08:54.483
L-- I can save Mom.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.846
At what cost?

08:56.920 --> 08:59.491
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

08:59.720 --> 09:01.722
- Well, I don't care.
-I do.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.250
I am in awe...

09:07.840 --> 09:10.764
...of the remarkable man
that you are becoming.

09:12.200 --> 09:15.363
All the things you've achieved,
and not just as the Flash...

09:15.560 --> 09:16.891
...but you, Barry...

09:17.080 --> 09:19.890
...your honesty, your heart.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.210
You were always a hero.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.602
And your mom would be just as proud.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.730
And if she had a say in this,
if she thought for one second...

09:30.920 --> 09:34.766
...you going back to save her would mean
you losing what makes you so special...

09:34.960 --> 09:36.962
...she would never want that.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.362
Barry, what I hope for you...

09:43.440 --> 09:46.603
...maybe the greatest thing
that a father can hope for his son...

09:46.800 --> 09:51.249
...is that one day
you will become a father yourself.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.049
And then you will know...

09:57.800 --> 10:02.408
...how much I truly love you.

[THERMOMETER BEEPS]

CAITLIN:
Ninety-eight-point-six.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.367
Normal.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.131
- Don't know what that word means anymore.
CAITLIN: Me neither.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.168
I know Barry really appreciates you
coming back to help him stop Wells.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.801
That's not the only reason I'm back, Cait.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.570
I'm here now, for good.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.922
- But I thought--
-I thought too.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.011
Okay, I thought too much about what might
happen if the government tracked us down.

10:28.600 --> 10:32.810
If we couldn't control our powers
and we hurt someone, if we hurt you.

10:34.120 --> 10:39.445
But I realized that, although
sometimes, I'm more than one man...

10:40.200 --> 10:42.646
...I'm not whole unless I'm with you.

10:42.840 --> 10:43.921
I love you, Cait.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.528
- Are you sure?
-I am.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.205
Once upon a time...

10:52.400 --> 10:55.370
...and a particle accelerator or so ago...

10:55.520 --> 10:56.806
...you agreed to marry me.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.971
- Yes, I did.
-What do you say we do that?

11:09.040 --> 11:10.565
IRIS:
Thought I might find you here.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.841
I needed to get out of the lab.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.402
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.244
Oh, it is, trust me.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.690
I've done a lot of thinking up here.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.965
When I wasn't having clandestine meetings
with the mysterious Streak.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.046
Yeah, not mad we lost that name.

So are you gonna do it?

11:54.600 --> 11:57.843
It's just so huge.

11:59.440 --> 12:04.401
It's the biggest decision of my life,
and if I'm wrong, I can't undo it.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.841
Why would you want to? I mean...

12:08.240 --> 12:10.846
...you'd get to see your mom again...

...your dad.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.203

Even get married.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.802
Iris West-Allen, huh?

12:22.120 --> 12:24.964
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

12:25.120 --> 12:28.647
Must be a 2024 thing.

We don't know that
that's gonna happen. I mean--

12:32.560 --> 12:37.521
Do you think that
because you didn't live with us...

12:37.720 --> 12:40.246
...that's why things are different there?

12:40.480 --> 12:47.045
Growing up together
and knowing so much about each other...

12:48.400 --> 12:52.530
...it made it hard for me
to admit how I felt about you.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.645
And I waited too long,
and you fell in love with Eddie.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.926
But...

13:02.960 --> 13:05.440
But living with you and Joe...

13:08.400 --> 13:10.323
I've had a great life, Iris.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.687
Come here, Barry.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.524
What do you think I should do?

13:23.960 --> 13:26.042
I need someone to tell me.

13:30.920 --> 13:31.967
I think...

13:33.160 --> 13:36.289
...that for once in your life, Barry Allen...

13:36.600 --> 13:38.841
...you should stop thinking
about other people.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.204
I think you should do what's in your heart.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.371
Do what you need to do for yourself.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.007
Ah.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.883
Well, if it makes you feel any better...

13:58.080 --> 14:01.289
...it took you a whole hour longer to decide
than I thought it would.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.324
So how does this work?

14:04.520 --> 14:09.686
- Your grand plan.
-Well, it's really not that grand at all, Barry.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.330
In fact, it's rather simple.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.410
- We use the particle accelerator.
-The particle acce--

14:14.600 --> 14:18.889
The last time that happened, you caused
an explosion that hurt a lot of people.

14:19.120 --> 14:24.001
This time, the accelerator will operate
exactly the way it was designed to.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.171
Except instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions...

14:28.320 --> 14:30.891
...colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring...

14:31.040 --> 14:34.362
...we're only gonna inject one particle
into the accelerator.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.649
And I'm what it collides with.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.922
And if you can go fast enough, Barry...

14:41.120 --> 14:43.930
...if you can hit that particle
with enough speed...

14:44.120 --> 14:47.010
...you will punch a hole
right through the fabric of reality.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.845
And you will create a portal...

14:49.040 --> 14:53.011
...connecting this time...to infinite times.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.886
A Wormhole.

back to the past...

...say, to the night your mother died,
or forward to the future to, say, my time.

15:05.880 --> 15:10.761
You said if I run fast enough.
What happens if I don't?

15:10.960 --> 15:14.123
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity, Barry...

15:14.640 --> 15:16.244
...you'll die.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.043
STEIN:
According to Wells' calculations...

15:23.280 --> 15:25.965
...Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.487
Once Barry reaches optimum speed...

15:28.640 --> 15:32.122
...we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.569
Once the collision happens,
a Wormhole forms...

15:35.800 --> 15:39.521
...opening a gateway into time itself.

15:40.080 --> 15:43.050
At that moment, I plan on shouting
something along the lines of:

15:43.200 --> 15:45.168
"Eureka," or possibly, "Excelsior."

15:45.360 --> 15:47.442
I'm uncommitted.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.047
What do you think?

15:50.320 --> 15:54.564
I mean, on the one hand,
it does make a kind of sense.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.087
On the other hand...

15:56.480 --> 15:57.527
...why?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.087
Why?

15:59.320 --> 16:02.688
- Why would you ever consider doing this?
-You know why.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.326
So for this to work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

16:05.560 --> 16:08.166
By my estimates, Mach <i>2</i> at a minimum.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.688
You've never gone that fast.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.844
So, what happens
if Barry doesn't reach that speed?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.288
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield. How far off am I?

16:19.120 --> 16:20.724
Not very far, I'm afraid.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.526
Let me worry about how fast I have to go.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.921
- We're gonna need something else too.
-Really?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.646
And what's that?
Because I don't know about you guys...

16:29.880 --> 16:33.202
...but I'm not at all interested in helping you
get yourself killed.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.209
I need you to build a time machine.

16:36.640 --> 16:37.880
Go on.

16:39.280 --> 16:43.205
So if Wells is as fast as you,
what's he need a time machine for?

16:43.400 --> 16:45.880
Apparently, he lost his speed
when he killed my morn.

16:46.080 --> 16:49.562
He gets it back sometimes, but only in spurts.
He can't fully control it.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.405
I was right. He was using
the wheelchair to charge himself.

16:52.560 --> 16:57.009
So after I open the wormhole, he's gonna need
the ship to travel back to the future.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.881
- He's been squirreling away the parts.
-Now we just need to put it together.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.089
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine...

17:04.240 --> 17:05.765
...not a bookcase from lkea.

17:06.040 --> 17:09.089
We got a problem.
These tiles, they're made of tungsten.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.130
Tungsten has the highest
melting point of any other element.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.760
Yeah, uh, but the dust it generates
is flammable.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.400
- The pressure exerted from the wormhole--
-Yeah, yeah.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.643
It could cause a hole
to be melted into the exterior.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.086
It could explode.

17:22.599 --> 17:23.601
Any ideas?

17:24.400 --> 17:26.607
Let me ask Dr. Evil.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.128
Heh. Which used to be a name
that made me smile.

17:36.040 --> 17:39.442
- Something on your mind, Cisco?
-No.

17:40.680 --> 17:45.447
Yes. How did you fit your Reverse-Flash suit
into that little ring?

17:45.640 --> 17:47.847
Is it some sort of compressed microtech?

17:48.120 --> 17:51.124
Or-- Actually, forget it. I don't care.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.450
Maybe a little.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.167
Ronnie's right. I should've accounted
for temporal shearing.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.482
Glad we're still good for something.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.963
I've never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

18:04.520 --> 18:09.321
Or Ronnie. As a matter of fact,
do you know how many times...

18:09.520 --> 18:12.171
...I wished you were with me
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

18:12.360 --> 18:14.169
- Would've been a lot more fun.
-Yeah?

18:14.400 --> 18:19.486
Well, it doesn't change the fact
that your nifty little Time Sphere--

18:19.680 --> 18:22.684
- Oh, is that what you're calling it?
-Whatever. It's gonna blow.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.121
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.369
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.685
Okay. Fine, we'll try that.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.331
That's it? That's all?

18:32.520 --> 18:34.124
Well, what do you want me to say?

18:34.320 --> 18:38.166
I don't know. I thought of anyone, you'd be
more understanding of my predicament.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.163
I don't belong here.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.244

18:53.840 --> 18:54.841
What did you say?

18:57.680 --> 19:02.004
It was an alternate timeline,
one that Barry reset.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.446
But I never forgot it.

19:03.880 --> 19:07.851
It just kept coming back to me.

19:08.240 --> 19:12.928
And I can still picture
the way you looked at me...

19:13.160 --> 19:14.571
...when you called me a son.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.770
And you crushed my heart...

19:18.960 --> 19:20.166
...with your fist.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.211
...I'm sorry.

19:25.400 --> 19:29.928
- Yeah, it sucked.
-Not for killing you. I'm sure I had a reason.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.687
I'm sorry for the fact that you're able
to retain traces of another timeline.

he told me about the future, I don't matter.

-Coincidence.
