of my mother's murder.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.238
Although I guess I didn't need to.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.530

while you got whisked away.

are you, Flash?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.677
Interesting.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.221
I know you didn't call me up here
just to banter.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.636
Let's ﬁnish this right now.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.555
Actually, I did.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.730
I called you up here to tell you

15:01.902 --> 15:04.564
you can't keep running
ﬁom one meta to the next.

15:05.489 --> 15:08.697

like a dog chasing its tail.

we're really just the same person.

15:29.221 --> 15:32.509
Yeah, you keep saying that,
but it's not gonna make it true.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.802
You'll see. We are.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.554
Same tragic background.
same reason for running,

15:41.066 --> 15:43.773
same desire to be the fastest,
to be the best.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.978
The difference?
You think your anger is dirty somehow.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.533
You want to be seen as pure, the hero.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.361
Doesn't it get exhausting?

15:53.328 --> 15:54.784
Doesn't it get exhausting, Barry?

15:54.955 --> 15:57.162
It was exhausting playing Jay, believe me.

I'm not pretending.

16:03.922 --> 16:07.255
I'd let that building tumble
without a second thought. But you?

16:07.425 --> 16:09.006
You'll never let that happen, will you?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.801
That's why I'm gonna beat you, Bany.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.796
Because you always have to be the hero.

16:16.393 --> 16:18.600

laying waste to Central City?

We take them down ﬁrst,
then Zoom's more vulnerable.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.923
Bany, we don't know even know
how many of his minions there are.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.932
There could be hundreds, a thousand.

they're all working with different powers.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.347

17:05.525 --> 17:08.858

with a way to stop them all at once.

-So, basically,

17:29.674 --> 17:33.337
we create some vibrational tech
that could take down the Earth-2 metas.

17:36.640 --> 17:37.629

18:35.031 --> 18:36.692
-Is he okay?
-Not really.

18:38.201 --> 18:40.908
Earlier, he thought
it would be a good idea

18:41.079 --> 18:46.540
if he used himself as bait
against a meta-human psycho.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.792
Thought he could do things
the way The Flash would.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.871
Joe, I mean, he did tell me

18:53.049 --> 18:56.337
that he wasn't gonna waste
the opportunity The Flash gave him.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.047
I don't know if you can stop him.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.257
I'm gonna have to
or he's gonna get himself killed.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.220
Look, he ain't you, Bany.
He can't just go Mach 50—

19:04.477 --> 19:06.058
(CHUCKLES) Mach 50 isn't a real thing.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.847
Point is, thinking you're invincible
isn't any kind of armor.

19:10.984 --> 19:14.192
Now, Wally's already at a higher risk
than I'm comfortable with,

19:14.362 --> 19:17.570
and him throwing caution to the wind
on top of all of that? No.

19:19.451 --> 19:20.440
We gotta keep him safe.

19:22.245 --> 19:26.909
So, can The Flash talk to him?

19:27.917 --> 19:28.906
Again.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.581
Yeah, I'll talk to him.
I'll try, I promise.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.496
-Yeah?

27:24.143 --> 27:25.178
What's the point?

27:28.105 --> 27:31.393
The point is so that it seems random.

27:32.318 --> 27:36.402
That way, The Flash and his meny band
won't realize what I'm up to

27:41.953 --> 27:43.113

-Are you kidding me with this?

27:55.383 --> 27:57.044
-Hey, at least it works.
-Tremendous.

27:57.218 --> 27:58.424
What is it, exactly?

27:58.594 --> 28:00.300
It's just a small source of joy.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.883
But more importantly,
it's how we're gonna stop Zoom's army.

28:03.057 --> 28:04.888
By giving them all electro-shock therapy?

28:05.059 --> 28:07.300
By giving them all
dimensional-shock therapy.

28:07.478 --> 28:10.265
This is where I play stupid
and you explain the science.

28:10.439 --> 28:14.182
Okay, fair enough. So, all matter vibrates
at its own unique frequency, right?

28:14.360 --> 28:16.442
You disrupt that frequency,
you disrupt the matter.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.819
Like how an opera singer shatters glass
with her voice.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.275
Exactly. So, we found out

28:20.449 --> 28:23.941
that all Earth-2 people vibrate
at their own, more erratic frequency.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.360
HARRISON: Higher ﬁequency.

28:25.538 --> 28:26.903
-Different frequency.
-Higher.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.621
-Higher frequency than we do.
-Right.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.408
So, I ran this all past Hartley, right?

28:32.587 --> 28:36.705
And he postulated that we could create
a sort of dimensional tuning fork. Voila!

28:36.883 --> 28:38.214
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.129
-Just let me have this one, okay?
-HARRISON: All right, have it.

28:41.304 --> 28:45.798
Thank you. So, if you run around the city
fast enough to create a reﬁacting ﬁeld,

28:45.975 --> 28:51.845
the device can send out a pulse
that will bounce off of it, split apart,

28:52.023 --> 28:54.355
WWIIFMUMEUImm

28:54.525 --> 28:57.107
Amplifying it to an erratic frequency
on the Earth-2—

28:57.278 --> 28:59.985
-Higher. Higher frequency.
-Higher frequency on the Earth-2 spectrum.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.112
And when that pulse hits anyone
from Earth-2—

29:02.283 --> 29:03.773
It'll disrupt their nervous system.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.946
Earth-2 metas go night-night.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.243
-Even Zoom?
-Even Zoom.

29:08.664 --> 29:09.824
Hany and Jesse are from Earth-2.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.489
How do we keep the pulse
from hurting them?

29:11.667 --> 29:12.952
Detective, I didn't know you cared.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.242
Yes, you did.

29:14.545 --> 29:17.833
