08:03.178 --> 08:05.615
Look, your demands
and how you sit

08:05.659 --> 08:08.357
and how the sweat
rolls down your brow

08:08.400 --> 08:11.273
into the crease of
your fat neck...

08:13.841 --> 08:15.625
Are we, uh, still negotiating,
or --

08:15.669 --> 08:17.671
It feels like it kind of
took a personal turn there.

08:22.937 --> 08:25.461
Wait, so they're just gonna
tear the place down?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.637
What exactly did you say
to this Alviti guy?

08:27.681 --> 08:29.247
Nothing.
I just went in there,

08:29.291 --> 08:30.727
I told him we wanted
a pinball machine,

08:30.771 --> 08:32.163
and -- and the guy just --
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.165
Pinball machine? [ Scoffs ]
We didn't authorize that.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.427
Yeah.
I think thinking on my feet.

08:35.471 --> 08:36.646
Yeah, okay, it's called
free-forming.

08:36.690 --> 08:37.952
You should've
stuck to the list.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.736
It's fine. It didn't matter
anyway, all right?

08:39.780 --> 08:41.042
I knew what I was doing.
I went in there,

08:41.085 --> 08:42.957
I was dressed sharp,
I had the half-glasses.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.393
Ooh, those always make you
look smart.

08:44.436 --> 08:47.265
They do.
But they had no effect, okay?

08:47.309 --> 08:49.180
The guy had his mind made up
before we even got there.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.704
I can't believe it.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.314
This place has been here
longer than we've been alive.

08:52.357 --> 08:56.100
True. Sign outside says,
"Established 1943."

08:56.144 --> 08:57.362
-Yeah.
-How many years is that?

08:57.406 --> 08:59.451
-Uh...uh...
-Well, six plus seven --

08:59.495 --> 09:00.888
Six plus seven?
You don't do 6 by --

09:00.931 --> 09:02.759
You add 7 to the 43
to make it 50

09:02.803 --> 09:03.891
so it gives you
an even number.

09:03.934 --> 09:06.546
Siri, what's what 2018
minus 1943?

09:06.589 --> 09:08.199
Of course --
you add up,

09:08.243 --> 09:10.550
and then you take it away
afterwards.Wait, I got -- I got 50.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.334
-Why would you even do that?
-75 years.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.422
-Okay --
-75 years, idiots!

09:13.465 --> 09:15.119
Nice job, okay?

09:15.163 --> 09:16.338
You ruined it.
I had it, but --

09:16.381 --> 09:17.469
-You had it? Yeah.
-[ Grumbles indistinctly ]

09:17.513 --> 09:19.036
Whoa, whoa, wait.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.257
That means that Enzo's might
qualify for historic status.

09:23.519 --> 09:24.651
What -- what is that?

09:24.694 --> 09:25.913
It means that they can't
tear it down.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.305
I mean, you couldn't even
paint the place

09:27.349 --> 09:28.655
without getting approval
from the town.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.091
Well, that --
That's perfect.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.179
W-What would be
the next step?

09:31.222 --> 09:32.963
We just have to
petition the town

09:33.007 --> 09:34.791
to have it designated
a historic landmark.

09:34.835 --> 09:37.446
Then that's what we're gonna do.
Perfect.

09:37.489 --> 09:38.795
We're done. Boom!
-Yeah.

You're sticking with
the glasses, huh?

09:51.895 --> 09:54.550
Absolutely.
I can handle this, okay?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.552
[ Gavel bangs ]Next on the docket --

09:56.596 --> 10:00.600
a motion to grant
Enzo's Pizzeria historic status.

I am a retired police officer

Your Honor, with your
permission, I would like to --

Sir, I'm not a judge.

as "Your Honor."

10:26.713 --> 10:28.628

Okay.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.934
I'd, uh, now like to
call, uh, attention

10:30.978 --> 10:33.981
to Massapequa code 55,
Section 11B,

10:34.024 --> 10:36.940
which states, to wit per se,

10:36.984 --> 10:39.595
"In the case of
places deemed historic" --

10:39.639 --> 10:41.379

we wrote the code.

You really don't need to
read it to us.

Do you have any information

10:55.959 --> 10:57.918
that might actually
support your case?

10:57.961 --> 10:59.789
Yes. I, uh...

10:59.833 --> 11:01.486
Your notes
are in your folder.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.575
[ Stammers ]Mr. Gable, perhaps
you should come back

I-I'm gonna be honest, I'm not
very good at the official stuff,

they're making me nauseous.

they'd make you see clearer,

a second that it would be

anything other than a smoking
gun is completely asinine.

a little bribe-arooski
to the judge lady.

but we saw it.

And there's
your smoking bun.

You mean smoking gun.

15:50.384 --> 15:54.214
Bun, gun,
both are acceptable.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.825
So, you found out
I made a legal donation.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.653

to maintain

in the city.

I also donate to a church that
works with underprivileged kids.

for that "bribe."

They're a good bunch.
I-I've heard of 'em.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.807
Looks like you brought a bun
to a gunfight.

16:24.548 --> 16:25.810
So,
it'll be really great

16:25.854 --> 16:27.638
if I never see you guys
ever again, okay?

We were gonna be polite,

We investigate stuff
for a living,

16:41.565 --> 16:44.177

until we find something.

we're gonna drag you to court.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.488
No, we do not.

I-I'm impressed.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.936
I didn't expect this
from someone

17:04.980 --> 17:08.201
who wore sweat pants
to a City Council meeting.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.029
They're called Stretch-E-Slacks,
okay?

17:10.072 --> 17:12.509

about your pants.Energy. He asked.

work something out.

You do security,
don't you?

17:19.429 --> 17:21.823
We own our own security company,
yeah. Why?

17:21.866 --> 17:23.955
Well, my company
has six parking lots,

17:23.999 --> 17:26.045
and the current security
is not working out so well,

17:26.088 --> 17:30.571
so you agree not to buzz-z-z
around in my ear,

17:30.614 --> 17:33.574

hiring you guys.

You got that so fast.

Yes, not only is gonna
keep Enzo's as-is,

a security contract out of it.

what did you guys do?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.315
Well, we told him we were gonna
investigate the crap out of him,

and then he just folded
like a house of cards.

used to pick on Tommy McDonough

until Tommy told him that
his dad knew Chuck Norris,

19:12.238 --> 19:13.456

he just stopped.

Chuck Norris --

Chuck Norris' name

-Okay, because --
