03:26.708 --> 03:27.834
A son?

03:30.579 --> 03:31.978
I have a son?

03:32.180 --> 03:34.045
Eight pounds.

03:37.886 --> 03:40.286
And Sunny? Is she all right?

03:41.723 --> 03:44.317
Shall I make the announcement?

03:53.935 --> 03:55.596
It's incredible.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.676
I have a son.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.750
He's not the first boy
ever born, you know.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.396
Does he have to be Alexis?
Can't we call him something else?

04:22.731 --> 04:24.926
Alexis was a gentle czar.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.430
Perhaps the only one.

04:26.635 --> 04:28.296
Not counting you.

04:28.837 --> 04:31.704
I thought we'd go on
having girls forever.

04:31.907 --> 04:34.239
I still can't believe...
Oh, you're dribbling.

04:34.943 --> 04:36.433
Let me.

04:38.213 --> 04:40.238
I prayed so hard.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.740
I'm sure that's how it happened.

04:43.885 --> 04:45.352
You heard him cry.

04:45.554 --> 04:47.784
Not much.
I'll pinch him, shall I?

04:47.989 --> 04:50.116
He's going to be enormous.

04:50.325 --> 04:52.691
Even bigger than your father was.

04:53.862 --> 04:56.456
We couldn't call him Alexander,
could we?

04:56.832 --> 05:00.063
He's asleep.
Undoubtedly, we've bored him.

05:01.570 --> 05:03.094
Do you want him for a minute?

05:03.305 --> 05:04.932
Not particularly.

05:13.415 --> 05:15.212
I've had a son.

05:15.717 --> 05:18.242
For years, I've daydreamed
how I'd feel.

05:18.453 --> 05:20.978
And all that time,
I never dreamed...

05:22.591 --> 05:25.992
I'm filled with...
I don't know.

05:26.194 --> 05:29.493
It isn't joy or anything like that.
It's more.

05:29.698 --> 05:31.666
It's terribly important.

05:32.467 --> 05:34.935
And I don't know why you're smiling.

05:35.137 --> 05:36.468
<i>Du bist ein Dummkopf.</i>

05:37.139 --> 05:38.538
<i>Du auch.</i>

05:43.945 --> 05:47.210
Tegleva, if he wakes up hungry,
bring him back.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.042
Yes, Majesty.

05:50.051 --> 05:52.576
At once, no matter what the time is.

05:53.054 --> 05:55.750
The dispatches from Port Arthur.
They've been in for hours.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.948
Can't that wait?

05:58.160 --> 05:59.684
I wish it could.

06:00.328 --> 06:02.353
The boy will bring us luck.

06:02.564 --> 06:06.193
We'll smash the Japanese
and drive them from Korea.

06:06.401 --> 06:07.891
I have a son to fight for now.

06:08.904 --> 06:10.496
We have a son.

06:12.607 --> 06:14.438
If you don't get some rest,
he'll starve.

06:15.744 --> 06:17.075
Have I made you happy?

06:18.947 --> 06:20.608
No, not much.

06:23.852 --> 06:26.343
I think I like your gentle czar.

06:27.322 --> 06:29.620
Let's call him Alexis.

06:37.098 --> 06:39.623
I don't like entertaining
with a war on.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.233
Not right somehow.

06:41.436 --> 06:44.234
So we've kept it small.
Just family.

06:44.806 --> 06:46.171
I can't wait.

06:46.508 --> 06:47.440
Good girl!

06:48.376 --> 06:49.809
You'll make a partygoer yet.

06:50.011 --> 06:52.275
See you in
Saint Petersburg tonight.

06:53.648 --> 06:55.707
Come on now, Nicky.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.475
All right, Uncle.

06:58.186 --> 07:00.086
Who's the sober-looking fellow?

07:00.288 --> 07:02.518
Gilliard, the new French tutor.

07:02.791 --> 07:03.951
Can't you stay?

07:04.159 --> 07:05.956
- We're seeing Witte.
- That man!

07:06.161 --> 07:08.129
- He's a brilliant prime minister.
- I never liked him.

07:08.797 --> 07:10.264
I'm the one he bellows at.

07:10.465 --> 07:11.830
You shouldn't let him.

07:12.033 --> 07:14.968
He's your servant.
Everyone's your servant.

07:15.403 --> 07:16.927
You're too gentle.

07:17.138 --> 07:20.039
You should slam your fist down
as your father always did.

07:22.277 --> 07:23.505
It's no use.

07:23.945 --> 07:25.207
Frowning helps.

07:27.382 --> 07:28.576
It's baby.

07:30.151 --> 07:33.314
Did he have a good night?
Did he miss me?

07:34.122 --> 07:35.054
Come look.

07:35.257 --> 07:37.384
I haven't seen him
since last night.

07:37.592 --> 07:39.389
I think he's aged.

07:40.595 --> 07:41.721
What's this?

07:41.930 --> 07:43.363
Nothing.

07:52.340 --> 07:54.467
Pull out or I'll
not answer for it!

07:54.943 --> 07:57.070
You must show me
how you do that.

07:58.380 --> 08:02.043
Have I Your Majesty's permission
to review the facts again?

08:02.817 --> 08:04.045
If Port Arthur falls...

08:04.252 --> 08:06.015
No fact begins with "if."

08:09.024 --> 08:12.118
Port Arthur has been
under siege for six months.

08:12.394 --> 08:14.624
It has cost us 30,000 dead.

08:17.899 --> 08:20.129
A student stopped me
in the street the other day.

08:20.335 --> 08:23.498
"Excuse me, sir, but why
are we at war?"

08:23.705 --> 08:25.605
"Because, my boy, we want Korea...

08:25.807 --> 08:27.866
...but the Japanese will
insist on fighting us for it."

08:28.076 --> 08:31.136
"Thank you, sir. But what does
Russia need Korea for?"

08:31.346 --> 08:35.510
"Because, my boy, we have
no ice-free port on the Pacific."

08:35.717 --> 08:38.116
"I see. In that case, sir,
it isn't good enough."

08:38.320 --> 08:39.753
He's right, sir.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.888
It's not good enough at all.

08:43.325 --> 08:45.088
Imagine, sire.

08:45.660 --> 08:48.788
Imagine that you
are a factory worker.

08:48.997 --> 08:51.898
You're really poor.
Your belly is never full.

08:52.100 --> 08:54.193
You freeze eight months
of the year.

08:54.402 --> 08:57.565
Your children have
no school, no doctor.

08:58.473 --> 09:00.805
Your country taxes you...

09:01.576 --> 09:03.544
...and sends your sons
a continent away...

09:03.745 --> 09:06.805
...to die on a piece of land
on the Pacific.

09:07.015 --> 09:11.145
Now, sir, Japan is
a third-rate power.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.688
If she defeats us...

09:14.189 --> 09:17.283
...if Port Arthur falls...

09:17.926 --> 09:19.985
...we shall be disgraced
in the eyes of the world...

09:20.195 --> 09:22.720
...and here at home we'll have
an insurrection.

09:22.931 --> 09:24.899
My people love me,
Sergei Julievitch.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.731
They want a constitution...

09:27.936 --> 09:31.303
...and the right to vote
for an elected <i>Duma.</i>

09:31.806 --> 09:32.932
They're angry...

09:33.641 --> 09:34.608
...and they're serious.

09:34.843 --> 09:36.708
Are you advising me to
give my rights away?

09:37.212 --> 09:40.340
I am advising you to
stop a hopeless war.

09:41.950 --> 09:43.747
Is it so hopeless, Nikolasha?

09:43.952 --> 09:45.544
Well, Nicky...

09:45.754 --> 09:47.654
...let me put it this way.

09:48.323 --> 09:51.383
Here's a bullet, a bullet
made in St. Petersburg.

09:51.726 --> 09:53.353
I send it off to war.

09:53.561 --> 09:54.960
How does it get there?

09:55.163 --> 09:57.188
On a single spur of track...

09:57.399 --> 09:59.492
...4000 miles long.

09:59.701 --> 10:01.794
And in the middle,
no track at all.

10:02.804 --> 10:07.036
God help it, it spends
three days packed on sleds.

10:08.076 --> 10:11.534
And every boot, shell or
pound of tea we send.

10:12.647 --> 10:14.376
Get out now, Nicky...

10:15.583 --> 10:16.880
...while there's time.

10:17.619 --> 10:19.951
The Russia my father
gave me never lost a war.

10:21.122 --> 10:23.682
What shall I say to my son
when the time comes?

10:24.793 --> 10:26.522
That I had no pride?

10:26.728 --> 10:28.195
That I was weak?

10:29.130 --> 10:30.620
I've always thought...

10:32.233 --> 10:34.360
...God meant me to rule.

10:34.936 --> 10:36.528
He put me here.

10:37.405 --> 10:40.340
He chose me, and whatever
happens is His will.

10:41.342 --> 10:43.469
We shall fight on to victory.

10:43.678 --> 10:45.145
There will be no victory.

10:45.346 --> 10:47.371
Only strikes and riots.

10:48.516 --> 10:52.316
You must give your people
a little of what they want, sir.

10:52.754 --> 10:53.846
Not all...

10:54.656 --> 10:55.588
...just a taste.

10:55.824 --> 10:57.519
The English have a parliament.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.319
Our British cousins
gave their rights away.

11:00.528 --> 11:02.689
The Habsburgs and
the Hohenzollerns too.

11:02.897 --> 11:04.660
The Romanovs will not.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.131
What I was given...

11:07.335 --> 11:09.269
...I will give my son.

11:12.874 --> 11:16.401
These comrades want a larger movement
that will embrace...

11:16.611 --> 11:20.741
...all politically-minded people
who can subscribe to a wider dogma.

11:20.949 --> 11:22.473
They wish to join hands...

11:22.684 --> 11:23.844
Excuse me.

11:29.224 --> 11:30.384
May I?

11:42.837 --> 11:45.101
This is my first conference.

11:47.842 --> 11:50.709
- I've been in Siberia.
- So was I.

11:52.313 --> 11:53.280
How long?

11:53.481 --> 11:55.711
- I was sentenced to three years.
- So was I.

11:55.917 --> 11:58.545
I only stayed for a month.
I made a run for it.

12:00.522 --> 12:02.956
He wants to introduce himself.

12:03.791 --> 12:04.951
Stalin.

12:06.127 --> 12:07.890
I've inquired about you.

12:14.369 --> 12:15.597
Trotsky.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.900
You've been avoiding me.

12:19.641 --> 12:21.268
How are you going to vote?

12:21.910 --> 12:24.003
- Against your motion.
- You're a fool!

12:24.212 --> 12:25.236
I'm sorry.

12:25.613 --> 12:28.013
I can't always do what you tell me.

12:28.283 --> 12:33.050
The Romanovs are crowing over
their new heir and the Party's a mess.

12:33.454 --> 12:35.786
- I'll win in spite of you.
- You'll split the Party.

12:35.990 --> 12:37.150
I intend to.

12:37.492 --> 12:39.050
It needs it.

12:40.161 --> 12:42.129
Martov, will you vote for me?

12:42.330 --> 12:44.594
No, against.

12:45.033 --> 12:46.762
Come on, Martov.

12:48.970 --> 12:53.168
He doesn't realize what you're doing.
I'm sure you're right.

12:54.542 --> 12:55.736
Good.

12:56.477 --> 12:58.377
So you're going to vote for me?

12:59.213 --> 13:02.546
I would, but I'm not a delegate.
I can't vote.

13:07.155 --> 13:08.452
Mr. Lenin.

13:10.925 --> 13:14.656
Excuse me, Mr. Lenin.
I'm from the "Socialist Worker."

13:14.862 --> 13:17.990
What do you think of
the Socialist movement in England?

13:18.199 --> 13:22.295
The English cut their meat wrong.
Their tea is terrible.

13:22.503 --> 13:25.597
And the weather was better
in Siberia.

13:25.807 --> 13:28.298
But you keep your policemen
under control.

13:30.578 --> 13:32.603
The vote will now be taken.

13:32.981 --> 13:34.312
Pay attention.

13:34.816 --> 13:37.410
You're about to see
the birth of the Bolshevik Party.

13:37.619 --> 13:39.211
How do you spell that?

13:39.420 --> 13:41.217
I'm going to vote.

13:41.422 --> 13:43.322
Come on, Pankratov.

13:45.293 --> 13:47.557
B-O-L-S...

13:57.338 --> 13:58.771
Good night, Papa.

13:58.973 --> 13:59.837
Good night, Mama.

14:00.041 --> 14:01.565
Good night, darlings.

14:05.513 --> 14:06.639
I wish we didn't have to go.

14:06.848 --> 14:09.976
- It's Mama's birthday.
- Can't we say I have a headache?

14:10.184 --> 14:13.119
You're just shy.
You're too old for that now.

14:56.597 --> 14:58.792
You enjoy yourself at parties.

14:59.167 --> 15:00.532
I get headaches.

15:02.737 --> 15:06.138
If you sat there knowing everyone
disliked you, feeling like a foreigner...

15:06.340 --> 15:08.672
- No one dislikes you.
- Yes, they do.

15:09.911 --> 15:12.072
You never see unpleasant things.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.941
You drift away.

15:15.049 --> 15:16.983
I wonder if you
hear me half the time.

15:17.185 --> 15:19.745
Just now I find you
all too audible.

15:23.458 --> 15:24.516
Guess what?

15:25.226 --> 15:27.160
You've got your headache.

15:42.777 --> 15:43.869
Mother, dear.

15:56.224 --> 15:59.785
Not even London on a Sunday is as boring
as a room full of Romanovs.

15:59.994 --> 16:01.928
We see them rarely, Mama.

16:02.563 --> 16:04.622
You see everyone rarely.

16:04.832 --> 16:07.562
We'd see more of you
if you traveled less.

16:12.974 --> 16:15.636
Witte had tea with me today.

16:19.714 --> 16:22.615
He talked about the war,
like everyone else.

16:22.817 --> 16:26.810
He ate all my sturgeon, but he
never stopped talking, clever man!

16:27.321 --> 16:28.447
- He thinks...
- I know what he thinks.

16:28.656 --> 16:30.283
He thinks we can't afford wars.

16:30.491 --> 16:31.753
It's too ambitious.

16:31.959 --> 16:35.918
We're an 18th century country
in a 20th century world.

16:36.130 --> 16:39.065
We need all our strength and money
to look after Russia.

16:39.267 --> 16:42.202
Don't waste it on those little
yellow Buddhists, or whatever they are.

16:43.037 --> 16:47.235
It's a great mistake to get involved
in all these strikes and wars.

16:47.608 --> 16:50.076
You only encourage them
by taking them seriously.

16:50.278 --> 16:53.008
- Your father always said...
- Thank you for your kind advice.

16:53.214 --> 16:54.704
I haven't finished yet, Nicky.

16:55.149 --> 16:59.017
I know I'm not as clever as I
pretend to be, but I'm sure of this:

16:59.220 --> 17:01.347
Get out of Korea
and forget about Japan.

17:01.556 --> 17:02.784
I'm 36.

17:03.591 --> 17:05.148
You must let me
look after this war.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.686
I'm going to see
if Sunny is all right.

17:13.434 --> 17:16.892
And I suppose everyone
will be expecting me to dance.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.231
Well, I mustn’t disappoint them.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.837
I hope it's not too cold for you.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.110
Can I get you some champagne?

17:29.317 --> 17:30.682
Thank you.

17:34.388 --> 17:38.757
Look. There's this fantastic
holy fellow just arrived.

17:39.026 --> 17:40.618
You must meet him.

17:40.828 --> 17:43.422
He's a live, authentic <i>starets,</i>
straight from the fields.

17:43.931 --> 17:46.456
Cures diseases by
the laying on of hands.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.134
I've seen him do it.

17:49.203 --> 17:50.864
Saw this fellow wheeled in...

17:51.539 --> 17:53.302
...legs like pretzels.

17:53.507 --> 17:54.565
Then the <i>starets...</i>

17:55.142 --> 17:57.702
...Gregory Rasputin is his name...

17:58.045 --> 18:00.070
...gave him a deep look...

18:00.348 --> 18:01.406
...touched him...

18:01.616 --> 18:03.243
...prayed a bit...

18:03.684 --> 18:07.586
...and up the pretzel popped
and skipped about the room.

18:08.322 --> 18:10.290
A bit grotesquely, I admit...

18:10.491 --> 18:12.550
...but you could tell
he was skipping.

18:15.529 --> 18:16.496
I'll send for him.

18:17.732 --> 18:18.858
Must you?

18:39.754 --> 18:41.881
<i>Batushka Tsar.</i>

18:48.029 --> 18:48.859
<i>Matushka.</i>

18:51.666 --> 18:52.690
Why are you afraid?

18:54.502 --> 18:55.469
Why am I what?

18:55.970 --> 18:57.301
I think you're frightened.

18:57.738 --> 19:00.138
Strangers frighten you.

19:05.313 --> 19:07.781
I knew a woman in Prokorvskoe...

19:08.316 --> 19:11.376
...that's my home,
a little village in Siberia.

19:11.852 --> 19:13.183
And this woman...

19:13.387 --> 19:15.719
...she was so afraid of strangers...

19:15.923 --> 19:19.154
...that she bought herself
a pinewood box and lived in it.

19:20.027 --> 19:21.756
Then one day...

19:22.163 --> 19:24.222
...her husband nailed the lid on...

19:24.465 --> 19:25.762
...dug a hole...

19:25.967 --> 19:27.400
...and dropped her into it.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.626
"Ivan, don't!" she cried.

19:30.071 --> 19:32.904
"But I only want to
make you happy," he said.

19:33.107 --> 19:37.373
"I know. But Heavers
full of strangers. Let me out!"

19:57.264 --> 19:59.198
Damned barn of a place.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.095
Like an icehouse.

20:01.736 --> 20:04.034
Never could stand marble.

20:04.372 --> 20:05.930
It gives you rheumatism.

20:07.108 --> 20:08.336
Have a drink.

20:09.710 --> 20:10.802
Quite right.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.647
Have some of this vodka.

20:16.550 --> 20:17.710
Keep you warm.

20:19.820 --> 20:22.914
You know, I want to sell
this place or give it away.

20:23.124 --> 20:25.558
But no one will be
fool enough to take it.

20:28.796 --> 20:29.888
God bless.

20:34.702 --> 20:36.795
I started late to be a <i>starets.</i>

20:37.171 --> 20:39.139
I was 20 when
this vision came.

20:39.507 --> 20:41.600
We peasants get
them all the time.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.974
The Virgin comes and tells them...

20:45.179 --> 20:47.613
...when to sell their sheep
if they want to make a profit.

20:48.549 --> 20:50.847
She told me to become a pilgrim.

20:51.152 --> 20:52.710
So I started to walk.

20:53.354 --> 20:56.949
I waited for her to tell me
when to stop, but she didn't.

20:57.491 --> 20:59.550
I walked 2000 miles...

21:00.027 --> 21:01.585
...and when I got to Greece...

21:01.796 --> 21:03.661
...I couldn't walk any further.
So I stopped.

21:05.566 --> 21:07.591
I spent two years
in a monastery...

21:07.802 --> 21:09.531
...and then I walked home again.

21:09.737 --> 21:12.103
Sometimes people say to me...

21:12.673 --> 21:15.164
..."What do I need
to become a <i>starets</i> ?"

21:15.376 --> 21:17.071
And I say, "Good feet."

21:21.248 --> 21:22.510
Father Gregory...

21:23.517 --> 21:24.449
...do you have visions?

21:25.519 --> 21:26.713
Sometimes.

21:27.221 --> 21:29.348
Why does God send them to you?

21:29.690 --> 21:31.851
God knows. I don't.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.190
I used to be a Lutheran.

21:34.395 --> 21:36.158
They take God very seriously.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.388
I take Him as
He comes, <i>Matushka.</i>

21:38.599 --> 21:40.328
When it pleases Him, He uses me.

21:40.935 --> 21:43.096
You mean He actually appears?

21:43.304 --> 21:44.202
You see Him?

21:44.405 --> 21:46.202
What's a vision like?

21:46.774 --> 21:48.935
Sometimes it's voices.

21:49.410 --> 21:52.106
Other times, I'm not sure
what I see.

21:52.813 --> 21:54.678
I know exactly what you mean.

21:56.917 --> 22:00.114
It happens to me sometimes
when I pray...

22:01.055 --> 22:02.488
...especially late at night.

22:03.090 --> 22:06.059
The candles flicker
and it's dark...

22:07.361 --> 22:10.455
...and out of the corner
of my eye, I think I see...

22:11.565 --> 22:13.328
I don't know what.

22:15.136 --> 22:17.070
And when I turn
to look, it's gone.

22:22.943 --> 22:25.173
You missed the ballet.
It was lovely.

22:25.746 --> 22:27.441
We can leave now, if you like.

22:27.648 --> 22:28.876
Already?

22:29.183 --> 22:30.707
But we haven't danced yet.

22:59.180 --> 23:01.080
May I say something intimate?

23:01.916 --> 23:03.144
In public?

23:03.350 --> 23:04.578
I'll whisper it.

23:05.019 --> 23:06.782
Well, if you must.

23:08.222 --> 23:09.814
I adore you.

23:27.975 --> 23:29.875
I had such a lovely time.

23:30.611 --> 23:33.079
And Father Gregory, I thought
he was delightful, didn't you?

23:33.280 --> 23:35.111
An interesting fellow, I suppose.

23:35.316 --> 23:37.876
They tell me in Siberia
the woods are full of them.

24:08.515 --> 24:10.574
The Tsarevitch's bruise
worried me.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.445
I made some tests.

24:13.087 --> 24:15.180
I wasn't sure.
I'm not a specialist.

24:15.389 --> 24:17.949
But I'm afraid
these gentleman concur.

24:19.159 --> 24:20.922
There is no doubt of it?

24:22.896 --> 24:23.920
No doubt of any kind?

24:24.298 --> 24:25.959
It is unquestionably hemophilia.

24:27.835 --> 24:28.733
I see.

24:31.205 --> 24:34.140
Excuse me, but it
takes a moment to absorb.

24:36.543 --> 24:38.067
And what's the treatment?

24:38.946 --> 24:39.776
Nothing, sire.

24:41.649 --> 24:43.617
That's not possible.
There must be medicines.

24:43.984 --> 24:45.008
There are no medicines.

24:47.021 --> 24:48.283
Nothing at all?

24:49.456 --> 24:50.445
I see.

24:51.091 --> 24:52.820
The female is the carrier.

24:53.027 --> 24:54.790
The mother gives
it to the son.

24:54.995 --> 24:57.190
Your mother got it
from her mother, Queen Victoria...

24:57.564 --> 24:59.259
...and passed it on to you.

25:00.100 --> 25:02.295
It strikes some males
and misses others.

25:02.503 --> 25:04.664
Of Victoria's four sons,
just one had hemophilia.

25:05.739 --> 25:07.070
And just one of mine.

25:07.608 --> 25:09.166
Some hemophiliacs grow up to lead...

25:09.543 --> 25:11.033
...quite long and normal lives.

25:11.245 --> 25:12.337
And some do not.

25:12.713 --> 25:15.181
The chemical that makes
the blood clot is missing.

25:15.382 --> 25:17.782
When he cuts himself,
he bleeds extensively.

25:17.985 --> 25:20.283
Then we'll see to it that Alexis
does not cut himself.

25:20.487 --> 25:22.352
It's more than that.
A surface wound...

25:22.556 --> 25:23.614
Let me.

25:26.126 --> 25:28.356
They tell me cuts
don't matter much.

25:28.696 --> 25:32.257
They tell me if Alexis cuts
his hand, they tie it very tight...

25:32.466 --> 25:34.900
...and after a little while
the bleeding stops.

25:35.102 --> 25:36.228
It's when he bleeds inside...

25:36.437 --> 25:37.267
Inside?

25:37.471 --> 25:39.905
They tell me any bump
can make him bleed inside.

25:40.107 --> 25:41.096
One never knows.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.473
An awful blow may
do no harm at all...

25:43.677 --> 25:46.168
...and then again,
a tiny tap and it begins.

25:46.547 --> 25:50.210
They tell me the blood seeps slowly,
sometimes going on for days.

25:50.417 --> 25:53.580
They tell me the area begins to swell,
fills up like a balloon...

25:53.954 --> 25:56.445
...until the pressure is
so great the bleeding stops.

25:56.657 --> 25:59.387
Then, while the swelling lasts,
the blood attacks the bone...

25:59.593 --> 26:02.187
It can leave a limb
all bent and twisted.

26:02.463 --> 26:04.931
While this is going on,
there's nothing they can do.

26:05.599 --> 26:07.226
That's what they tell me.

26:08.235 --> 26:09.566
Tell them...

26:12.373 --> 26:14.637
Tell them they are mistaken.

26:15.709 --> 26:18.200
Tell them we shall
go to other doctors.

26:19.413 --> 26:21.210
Tell them to get out.

26:22.416 --> 26:24.475
My son is perfect.

26:25.185 --> 26:27.085
He will have a long life...

26:27.287 --> 26:29.619
...and grow up
to be a great Tsar...

26:29.823 --> 26:31.222
...like his father.

26:33.594 --> 26:36.927
More troops! He's going to
send more men to die!

26:38.799 --> 26:41.495
Port Arthur falls and
Nicholas is sending more men!

26:42.903 --> 26:44.200
I say we students...

26:44.571 --> 26:45.936
...lead the way!

26:46.673 --> 26:50.074
I say we give him
a Port Arthur here!

26:50.711 --> 26:52.076
I say we mobilize...

26:52.946 --> 26:54.072
They're coming for us!

26:54.481 --> 26:56.278
Now, do we run or do we fight?

26:56.650 --> 26:57.844
We fight!

27:11.765 --> 27:13.528
This way, Father! Hurry!

27:26.713 --> 27:27.907
It's all over, Petya.

27:28.348 --> 27:29.406
She's dead.

27:40.427 --> 27:43.021
She lived her life
here in this place.

27:44.965 --> 27:46.557
She got married.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.759
I was born. Father died.

27:50.537 --> 27:52.562
My eldest son is playing...

27:52.940 --> 27:54.407
...here in this place...

27:54.975 --> 27:56.704
...and they go on working.

27:57.077 --> 27:58.669
Why not? They have to live.

27:59.513 --> 28:01.378
I work when they die.

28:01.949 --> 28:03.382
Let me hold him.

28:11.859 --> 28:13.952
I want to kill somebody.

28:17.598 --> 28:19.589
They come here sometimes...

28:20.467 --> 28:22.264
...the other factory workers...

28:23.203 --> 28:24.534
...and they tell us...

28:25.405 --> 28:27.373
...that we should
burn things down.

28:28.408 --> 28:29.705
Make bombs.

28:32.646 --> 28:34.614
Well, I want to fight back...

28:35.148 --> 28:35.876
...once!

28:36.517 --> 28:40.351
All violence begets is violence.
They'll beat you.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.715
There's a better way.

28:43.257 --> 28:45.282
We are going to see the Tsar.

28:45.859 --> 28:47.827
You know what they say, Father:

28:48.262 --> 28:50.890
God is too high
and the Tsar's too far away.

28:51.465 --> 28:53.899
The Tsar is here in Petersburg
to bless the troops.

28:54.268 --> 28:55.997
He's staying at the Winter Palace.

28:56.370 --> 28:58.895
Thousands of us will march
there on Sunday morning.

28:59.473 --> 29:01.464
I'll go to him on the balcony...

29:01.909 --> 29:03.900
...and read this:

29:04.411 --> 29:05.309
"Sire...

29:05.679 --> 29:08.239
...we working men and
inhabitants of St. Petersburg...

29:08.615 --> 29:10.207
...come to you, sire,
to seek...

29:10.584 --> 29:13.348
...for truth, justice
and protection.

29:13.921 --> 29:16.253
Only you can
hear our prayers.

29:16.623 --> 29:18.022
And if you do not...

29:18.392 --> 29:19.450
...we shall die...

29:20.060 --> 29:22.028
...here on this square...

29:22.396 --> 29:24.261
...before your palace."

29:40.147 --> 29:41.444
God is with you.

29:42.215 --> 29:43.842
St. George will guard you.

29:53.827 --> 29:55.226
St. George will guard you.

29:55.596 --> 29:56.528
<i>Batushka Tsar.</i>

30:00.267 --> 30:01.564
Come on, my friend.

30:01.935 --> 30:03.027
Stand up.

30:15.782 --> 30:17.477
It's beautiful to watch them.

30:17.918 --> 30:18.646
Bless you.

30:31.632 --> 30:33.361
We must get back
to Tsarkoe Selo.

30:34.167 --> 30:38.365
I've ordered the train already
and I'll cancel all the engagements.

30:38.739 --> 30:39.706
Vladimir, what is it?

30:40.374 --> 30:42.569
A message from Botkin.

30:43.644 --> 30:45.168
The Tsarevitch is bleeding.

30:45.579 --> 30:46.546
Oh, my God!

30:50.050 --> 30:52.109
How long before
our train comes?

30:52.786 --> 30:53.912
I don't know.

30:54.521 --> 30:55.385
Perhaps half an hour.

30:55.956 --> 30:56.786
I want to go.

30:57.758 --> 30:58.588
We will. We will.

30:58.959 --> 31:00.517
Now! Nicky, take me home.

31:00.894 --> 31:02.384
The train's the fastest way.
We must wait.

31:02.763 --> 31:05.527
I can't! My baby's bleeding.
I'm in Petersburg.

31:05.899 --> 31:07.457
He needs me. Half an hour!

31:07.968 --> 31:09.128
God, save my little boy!

31:09.503 --> 31:10.470
Sunny, stop!

31:10.837 --> 31:13.271
Take me away.
I want my baby. Let me go!

31:13.840 --> 31:15.068
You bless them.

31:15.442 --> 31:17.535
Think of the soldiers.
Think of the war, the weather.

31:17.911 --> 31:19.469
Think of anything,
but not baby.

31:19.846 --> 31:21.040
I can't!

31:22.616 --> 31:23.446
Do it.

31:29.222 --> 31:30.382
God is good.

31:32.159 --> 31:34.024
Believe in His mercy.

31:34.494 --> 31:36.792
He will not punish
the pure in heart.

31:37.564 --> 31:38.496
Believe in His mercy.

33:20.100 --> 33:21.089
Well...

33:22.269 --> 33:23.566
What if the bleeding
doesn't stop?

33:24.538 --> 33:25.596
It must.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.535
Botkin doesn't
think Alexis will...

33:30.877 --> 33:31.707
Die.

33:32.445 --> 33:33.104
Thank God.

33:33.480 --> 33:34.777
It isn't much to
thank Him for.

33:35.148 --> 33:35.842
Botkin said...

33:36.216 --> 33:38.707
What do doctors know?
They're useless.

33:40.720 --> 33:41.652
It's in God's hands.

33:42.022 --> 33:44.217
Submit, submit!

33:44.591 --> 33:45.819
You should have been a monk.

33:46.193 --> 33:47.182
Won't you ever fight?

33:47.561 --> 33:48.585
I can't fight you.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.255
My baby's dying.

33:51.198 --> 33:53.928
There are no medicines.
Christ Jesus!

33:56.069 --> 33:57.093
Don't come near me.

34:28.068 --> 34:29.262
<i>Matushka.</i>

34:30.536 --> 34:32.197
I can't seem to
get them right.

34:32.572 --> 34:35.335
<i>Matushka,</i> tell me what it is.

34:36.309 --> 34:39.005
I keep thinking
the arrangement matters.

34:39.913 --> 34:41.904
I can't even remember
which saints they are.

34:42.282 --> 34:44.750
It doesn't matter.
They know you.

34:45.452 --> 34:47.420
I knew all their names once.

34:47.954 --> 34:48.818
I had to.

34:49.789 --> 34:52.553
To marry Nicky,
I had to change my faith.

34:52.926 --> 34:54.917
That was a great sin,
don't you think?

34:55.295 --> 34:56.592
God thinks so.

34:56.963 --> 34:58.624
He won't hear me when I pray.

34:58.999 --> 34:59.829
I've sinned...

35:00.200 --> 35:01.599
...and he won't listen.

35:01.968 --> 35:03.902
All saints were sinners once.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.239
God loves sinners.

35:07.874 --> 35:09.671
Then why is he killing my baby?

35:11.378 --> 35:13.505
We had a man in Prokorvskoe.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.814
He didn't wash or work.

35:16.216 --> 35:19.549
He lied, stole, cheated, drank...

35:19.920 --> 35:21.353
...chased all the women.

35:21.721 --> 35:23.120
He was a sinner.

35:23.490 --> 35:26.721
Why, out of all men,
did the Virgin come to him?

35:28.695 --> 35:30.287
Perhaps he lied.

35:30.664 --> 35:32.222
You said he was a liar.

35:33.667 --> 35:35.066
She came.

35:35.735 --> 35:37.168
I saw her.

35:38.271 --> 35:40.637
I know all there is
to know about sin.

35:42.142 --> 35:43.666
Pray with me, <i>Matushka.</i>

35:44.210 --> 35:45.677
God is here.

35:48.949 --> 35:50.246
I can't.

35:51.685 --> 35:53.152
That's my punishment.

35:55.255 --> 35:56.813
I shouldn't have sent for you.

35:57.190 --> 35:58.953
I don't know you at all.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.617
If baby wakes, he'll need me.

36:02.028 --> 36:02.960
Goodbye.

36:05.732 --> 36:07.359
The child will die...

36:08.501 --> 36:11.368
...if you don't get down on
your knees and beg for his life...

36:11.738 --> 36:15.071
...like a peasant begging
for crusts at your door.

36:16.109 --> 36:17.906
You will be taken
back to St. Petersburg.

36:18.278 --> 36:19.370
Wait outside.

36:19.746 --> 36:21.805
I knew you were
going to send for me.

36:22.182 --> 36:25.413
I knew the child was sick.
I know what's the matter with him.

36:27.787 --> 36:28.776
You can't!

36:29.155 --> 36:32.022
I see blood when
I shut my eyes.

36:32.726 --> 36:34.318
A lot of blood.

36:35.996 --> 36:37.463
I saw blood once before...

36:37.831 --> 36:39.560
...when I was in Jerusalem.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.059
And then my father died.

36:43.136 --> 36:47.436
In Kazan, there's an
ivory Christ, and the wounds bleed.

36:48.008 --> 36:52.672
Someone told me there's a Madonna
in Kharkov that sheds real tears.

36:54.481 --> 36:55.709
<i>Matushka.</i>

36:56.449 --> 36:57.609
I see things.

36:58.184 --> 36:59.549
I have power!

37:00.387 --> 37:02.150
I cure the sick.

37:03.323 --> 37:06.554
Holy men kneel to me
and kiss my hands.

37:07.394 --> 37:08.986
I am a vessel of the Lord.

37:10.030 --> 37:12.055
I have spoken with God.

37:12.699 --> 37:14.132
It must be so.

37:14.501 --> 37:16.435
How else can I
do these things?

37:16.803 --> 37:19.101
I save souls and bring peace.

37:19.906 --> 37:21.464
God leads me.

37:21.908 --> 37:23.170
He brought me here.

37:23.543 --> 37:25.135
He speaks through me.

37:25.512 --> 37:27.673
I am the voice of God.

37:28.048 --> 37:29.447
It is His will.

37:29.816 --> 37:33.013
<i>I have been sent</i>
<i>to do great things.</i>

38:49.829 --> 38:50.796
Your Majesty.

38:51.197 --> 38:52.323
Baby's better.

39:55.261 --> 39:56.455
Go back!

39:57.497 --> 39:58.293
Stop!

39:59.132 --> 40:00.997
We come in peace!

40:01.501 --> 40:03.560
We come to see our Tsar!

40:04.504 --> 40:06.802
We come in peace!

40:08.208 --> 40:08.867
Go back!

40:09.242 --> 40:12.541
We come to see our father!
Peace! Peace!

40:15.148 --> 40:16.581
High angle!

40:19.652 --> 40:20.744
Fire!

40:57.824 --> 41:00.019
Slaughtered like cattle!

41:01.694 --> 41:02.626
He didn't come.

41:04.664 --> 41:05.892
He never came.

41:07.967 --> 41:10.435
Nicholas, the murderer.

41:11.804 --> 41:14.773
The bloody, bloody murderer.

41:25.685 --> 41:26.617
Mama!

41:42.802 --> 41:44.565
- Why wasn't I told?
- Your Majesty.

41:44.771 --> 41:47.137
Who gave the order?
How did it happen?

41:47.340 --> 41:49.171
- Why wasn't I told?
- As I understand it...

41:49.375 --> 41:50.740
How many dead?
Who ordered the shooting?

41:52.111 --> 41:54.238
Hundreds of bodies.
Nobody ordered it.

41:54.681 --> 41:57.013
Someone's responsible.
You run this government.

41:59.118 --> 42:01.211
This came last night.

42:02.021 --> 42:03.352
It reads:

42:03.556 --> 42:05.114
"Sire, we working men..."

42:05.325 --> 42:07.987
Answer me!
How many were killed?

42:08.194 --> 42:10.355
I don't know yet,
certainly hundreds.

42:10.563 --> 42:12.087
Why wasn't I told
they were marching?

42:12.532 --> 42:15.194
- Would you have met them?
- How could I?

42:15.401 --> 42:16.959
Would you have
given them a Duma?

42:17.170 --> 42:18.364
Elections? Schools?

42:18.805 --> 42:20.898
Why bother to inform you?
You wouldn't have done anything!

42:21.341 --> 42:23.468
- I want a good life for my people.
- On your terms.

42:23.676 --> 42:25.644
I know what will
make them happy.

42:25.845 --> 42:29.076
They're children and they need a Tsar.
They need tradition, not this.

42:29.515 --> 42:31.506
They're the victims of agitators.

42:31.718 --> 42:34.915
A Duma would make them
bewildered and discontented.

42:35.355 --> 42:37.118
And don't tell me
about London and Berlin!

42:37.323 --> 42:38.517
God save us from
the mess they're in.

42:39.392 --> 42:40.256
I see.

42:40.893 --> 42:44.192
So, they talk, pray, march, plead...

42:44.397 --> 42:48.493
...petition and what do they get?
Cossacks, prison, flogging, police!

42:48.701 --> 42:50.896
And now, after today,
they will be shot!

42:51.104 --> 42:52.935
Is this God's will?

42:53.373 --> 42:54.965
Are these His methods?

42:55.508 --> 42:56.998
Make war on
your own people.

42:57.210 --> 43:00.236
How long do you think they'll
stand and let you shoot them?

43:00.446 --> 43:02.778
You ask me who's responsible!

43:02.982 --> 43:04.779
You ask!

43:05.451 --> 43:08.284
Russia will explode!
A massacre in Petersburg!

43:08.721 --> 43:11.485
Now the Japanese have forced Nicholas
to accept peace on their terms.

43:11.924 --> 43:13.414
He's lost the war!

43:13.693 --> 43:16.253
Thousands of soldiers killed,
and all for nothing.

43:16.462 --> 43:19.124
This time Nicholas
has destroyed himself.

43:19.332 --> 43:21.129
I'm going to Petersburg!

43:21.334 --> 43:24.235
But you'll need bombs
and explosives and ammunition.

43:24.437 --> 43:25.665
They can be smuggled in, Leon.

43:25.872 --> 43:27.806
For God's sake, don't
discuss that with her!

43:28.007 --> 43:30.305
She probably thinks you can
wheel machine guns...

43:30.510 --> 43:32.603
...across the frontier
in a baby carriage.

43:32.845 --> 43:35.313
Who wrote this
extraordinary rubbish?

43:36.416 --> 43:37.474
You're not going to print it?

43:38.050 --> 43:40.211
I was going to speak
to you about it first.

43:40.420 --> 43:42.513
This must be some of
your nonsense, Trotsky.

43:42.989 --> 43:44.889
"Lenin's theory comes to this:

43:45.091 --> 43:47.025
The Party decides
what the people think.

43:47.226 --> 43:49.194
An elite decides
what the Party thinks.

43:49.395 --> 43:51.522
The Central Committee decides
what the elite thinks.

43:51.964 --> 43:54.489
And Lenin decides
what they all think."

43:56.369 --> 43:57.233
You will print it?

43:57.603 --> 43:58.695
I can't.

43:59.505 --> 44:01.268
The style's atrocious.

44:02.542 --> 44:04.840
I'll never understand you.

44:05.044 --> 44:07.012
You hate anyone who's not your
kind of Bolshevik...

44:07.213 --> 44:08.475
...more than you hate the Tsar.

44:08.681 --> 44:10.672
No wonder they
call you Robespierre.

44:10.883 --> 44:13.181
Everybody's got to think
like you or they're out.

44:13.386 --> 44:16.844
He thinks freedom is something you
write on a wall but don't practice.

44:17.056 --> 44:17.988
That's not true.

44:18.825 --> 44:21.726
Of course I agree you're
free to say what you like.

44:22.061 --> 44:24.325
You must agree I'm free
to shoot you for saying it.

44:25.164 --> 44:26.825
Murder, arson, terror.

44:27.266 --> 44:29.962
I'll agree to anything
that gives us power.

44:30.203 --> 44:31.295
Power!

44:31.838 --> 44:34.671
And we can't have power
if we compromise.

44:35.241 --> 44:36.469
Even though it takes years.

44:36.909 --> 44:39.104
Terror and power!

45:23.389 --> 45:24.356
Be careful!

45:25.024 --> 45:25.854
Are you all right, Alexei?

45:26.459 --> 45:29.121
Alexei, Alexei, mustn’t run
and mustn’t play!

45:29.328 --> 45:30.659
Mustn’t jump and mustn’t climb.

45:30.863 --> 45:32.421
Must be careful all the time.

45:36.002 --> 45:37.833
You must try to understand.

45:38.471 --> 45:39.995
Your mother worries.

45:40.206 --> 45:41.673
We both do.

45:43.276 --> 45:45.107
Alexei, Alexei, mustn’t run...

45:45.611 --> 45:47.374
...and mustn’t play!
Mustn’t jump and mustn’t climb.

45:47.580 --> 45:49.241
Must be careful all the time.

45:49.682 --> 45:50.910
I found some mushrooms.

45:51.117 --> 45:54.575
Father wouldn't let me pick them.
He said they were poisonous.

45:54.987 --> 45:57.751
They were green.
I'm hungry.

45:59.792 --> 46:01.953
All you ever serve
is bread and butter.

46:02.161 --> 46:03.389
It's tradition.

46:03.896 --> 46:05.693
I'll do better in the kitchen.

46:05.898 --> 46:08.958
Nagorny, don't let him
run too fast!

46:10.202 --> 46:12.067
He's always happy here at Livadia.

46:12.271 --> 46:13.568
The Crimea's good for him.

46:13.773 --> 46:15.104
It's good for all of us.

46:15.308 --> 46:17.469
- Some tea?
- One cup.

46:18.210 --> 46:21.008
Before Stolypin comes,
I'd like to play a little tennis.

46:21.213 --> 46:22.771
We have so few days here.

46:22.982 --> 46:24.779
Can't your ministers
leave us alone?

46:24.984 --> 46:25.951
You used to like him.

46:26.385 --> 46:28.148
For my sake, be as
gracious as you can.

46:28.988 --> 46:30.853
He's not a good man.
He's against us.

46:31.624 --> 46:34.320
Nonsense.
He's a great prime minister.

46:36.829 --> 46:38.262
I sent Father Gregory
to see him.

46:39.732 --> 46:41.427
You sent Rasputin?

46:42.401 --> 46:43.527
What in God's name for?

46:44.003 --> 46:46.597
Our friend reads
people's hearts.

46:46.839 --> 46:49.330
He knows who loves us
and who doesn't.

46:49.542 --> 46:50.372
He can tell.

46:50.843 --> 46:53.073
Stolypin is a bad man.

46:53.512 --> 46:56.276
In future, may I ask you, please...

46:57.950 --> 47:00.680
I don't care if he
talks to God or not...

47:00.886 --> 47:02.114
...Rasputin is a peasant!

47:03.422 --> 47:05.686
Is my judgment so inadequate?

47:05.992 --> 47:08.552
Am I too dense to tell
a statesman when I see one?

47:08.761 --> 47:09.693
What on earth...

47:19.372 --> 47:22.170
Stolypin, you look terrible.
Here's what we'll do.

47:33.653 --> 47:35.086
Peter Arkadiavitch!

47:35.354 --> 47:37.686
Only you could wear a briefcase
with a bathing suit.

47:38.391 --> 47:40.359
I think I'd feel
naked without it.

47:40.559 --> 47:42.993
Besides, I must have
somewhere to put my lifebelt.

47:56.909 --> 47:59.844
What you've done for Russia since
Witte's retirement is a miracle.

48:00.046 --> 48:03.140
Or a mirage.
Russia's too large.

48:03.349 --> 48:05.283
It's impossible to govern.

48:05.584 --> 48:07.176
I'm not what holds it
all together.

48:07.386 --> 48:08.478
You are.

48:08.688 --> 48:11.851
Which is why the Tercentenary
next month is so important to us.

48:12.291 --> 48:14.384
Final schedule is pending
your approval.

48:14.827 --> 48:17.261
I'm afraid the tour
is long and taxing.

48:17.463 --> 48:19.260
But it's critical
that people...

48:19.465 --> 48:21.797
...feel the dynasty is
permanent and strong.

48:22.435 --> 48:24.699
Three hundred years of Romanovs.

48:25.337 --> 48:27.032
That fact is vital to us.

48:27.473 --> 48:29.373
- It implies, first of all...
- Come on, Peter.

48:29.575 --> 48:30.906
Out with it.

48:31.444 --> 48:33.469
We leave for Petersburg tomorrow.

48:33.679 --> 48:36.409
What's so urgent that it
brings you all this way?

48:38.417 --> 48:40.442
One finds these everywhere.

48:41.287 --> 48:43.118
All over Petersburg.

48:43.989 --> 48:45.513
The printing is poor...

48:45.725 --> 48:47.158
...but the thought is clear.

48:48.594 --> 48:50.789
What's wrong with the Okrana?

48:51.163 --> 48:54.655
Can't 10,000 secret agents
find a printing press?

48:55.201 --> 48:57.396
They can't find all of them.

48:57.970 --> 48:59.164
I want it stopped.

48:59.371 --> 49:01.805
It's too late. They plan to
debate it in the <i>Duma.</i>

49:02.108 --> 49:03.268
Damn the <i>Duma</i>!

49:03.476 --> 49:04.602
Witte's work.

49:04.810 --> 49:06.675
He made me give it
to the people.

49:07.480 --> 49:09.209
Close it. Shut it down.

49:09.415 --> 49:11.747
I don't like the <i>Duma</i>
any more than you do.

49:12.017 --> 49:15.316
But I'd rather they talk
than riot, strike and march.

49:15.521 --> 49:17.489
Better to give them
more power than face that.

49:17.690 --> 49:18.588
I am the Tsar.

49:20.159 --> 49:21.854
And I would never accept that.

49:24.864 --> 49:26.388
Police reports...

49:26.632 --> 49:29.032
...on Gregory Efimovitch Rasputin.

49:29.602 --> 49:30.830
Drunk half the time.

49:31.036 --> 49:32.663
Whores, generals' wives...

49:32.872 --> 49:34.669
He's generous with himself.
I'll say that.

49:35.107 --> 49:36.904
That's his only Christian virtue.

49:37.109 --> 49:40.340
He'll sleep with anyone.
It's no secret, everybody knows it.

49:41.280 --> 49:42.872
He came to see me.

49:43.082 --> 49:44.777
Apparently with
Her Majesty's blessing.

49:45.151 --> 49:46.948
He even tried to hypnotize me.

49:47.153 --> 49:48.814
Why is such a man
admitted to the palace?

49:49.021 --> 49:51.148
- You know why.
- Your people don't.

49:51.357 --> 49:52.847
I'll tell them, shall I?

49:53.058 --> 49:56.994
Citizens, your Tsarevitch could
get a bloody nose and die from it.

49:57.296 --> 49:59.230
You must send him
away from Petersburg.

49:59.431 --> 50:00.363
How can I?

50:00.566 --> 50:02.363
People think he violates
your daughters and wife!

50:03.169 --> 50:06.070
Get him out! I can't control
the situation if you don't.

50:06.272 --> 50:07.671
And if I do?

50:07.873 --> 50:08.703
What happens if...

50:35.801 --> 50:36.927
Your Highness!

50:37.136 --> 50:39.070
It's all right, Nagorny.

50:39.371 --> 50:40.861
You'll always save me.

50:49.215 --> 50:51.274
It's all Nagorny's fault.

50:51.517 --> 50:54.281
Botkin warned us Alexis
would behave like this.

50:54.486 --> 50:57.046
It's a typical reaction.
It's even got a name.

50:57.256 --> 50:58.814
I don't care.

50:59.525 --> 51:01.425
A sailor for a nurse.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.489
It's an absurd idea.

51:03.762 --> 51:05.024
It's mine.

51:16.909 --> 51:19.275
I still say Alexei needs a nurse.

51:19.478 --> 51:21.207
He needs the company of men.

51:21.413 --> 51:22.380
Does he?

51:22.581 --> 51:25.880
He's with you all day long.
You hardly ever come to meals.

51:27.019 --> 51:28.646
I never seem to see you anymore.

51:30.389 --> 51:32.914
My place is where I'm needed most.

51:33.659 --> 51:36.753
It must be hard to have
so many people need you.

51:37.363 --> 51:38.728
I'll be patient.

51:39.632 --> 51:40.860
If I wait, my turn will come.

51:45.371 --> 51:47.805
What a mess I make of things.

51:49.008 --> 51:51.203
I meant to look so nice for you.

51:51.744 --> 51:54.679
I meant our last night in Livadia
to be beautiful.

52:09.261 --> 52:12.162
Sometimes I wonder
how you live with me.

52:12.464 --> 52:14.091
I wonder too.

52:14.900 --> 52:17.198
Only I know I could never
live without you.

52:30.883 --> 52:32.783
My decision stands.

52:34.186 --> 52:35.915
I've seen you out of courtesy.

52:36.322 --> 52:39.917
- If you've come here to plead...
- I came to say goodbye.

52:40.159 --> 52:41.751
I'm going home.

52:43.796 --> 52:46.060
I don't like St. Petersburg.

52:46.999 --> 52:48.762
It makes me drink too much.

52:48.968 --> 52:50.663
And when I drink...

52:51.904 --> 52:53.371
...the women come.

52:55.207 --> 52:58.074
The women here are worse
than the peasants in my village.

52:58.444 --> 53:00.275
They've no restraint.

53:03.082 --> 53:04.777
Is <i>Matushka</i> angry with me?

53:06.118 --> 53:09.246
She won't admit you even
take a drink, much less...

53:10.556 --> 53:11.386
No.

53:12.324 --> 53:14.121
She believes in you completely.

53:14.326 --> 53:15.816
She is a saint.

53:17.796 --> 53:19.058
<i>Matushka...</i>

53:19.498 --> 53:21.159
...if you need me
while I am gone...

53:21.367 --> 53:23.130
...pretend I'm with you.

53:23.335 --> 53:26.827
Say the things that trouble you,
as you always do, and it will help.

53:27.339 --> 53:29.637
I only sit and listen anyway.

53:30.209 --> 53:33.042
The voice of God is in you...

53:33.479 --> 53:35.538
...and no harm will come.

53:50.496 --> 53:52.020
It was necessary.

53:52.598 --> 53:53.496
Why?

53:54.166 --> 53:55.599
Stolypin recommended it.

53:55.801 --> 53:57.598
Our friend warned me he was bad.

53:57.803 --> 54:01.102
Rasputin drinks, takes bribes.
He is an adulterer.

54:01.306 --> 54:02.364
He is a saint.

54:02.574 --> 54:03.802
Little men always abuse them.

54:04.009 --> 54:05.408
I can show you
the police reports.

54:05.611 --> 54:06.475
More little men.

54:06.678 --> 54:08.168
People say he sleeps with you.

54:08.380 --> 54:09.745
What do I care
what people think?

54:09.948 --> 54:11.176
I have to care!

54:11.383 --> 54:12.748
I want him.

54:12.985 --> 54:14.350
- Bring him back.
- I can't.

54:14.553 --> 54:16.282
- Can't you do anything?
- I am.

54:16.488 --> 54:18.456
I'm standing up to you for once.

54:18.657 --> 54:20.147
Who's going to save Alexei?

54:20.359 --> 54:21.348
We have doctors.

54:21.560 --> 54:23.084
Damn your doctors!
What about my son?

54:23.295 --> 54:24.728
I've other important things
to answer for.

54:24.930 --> 54:27.091
I don't.
Give me Rasputin back!

54:27.699 --> 54:28.529
No, I will not.

54:28.867 --> 54:30.027
If baby dies, you murdered him!

54:30.402 --> 54:31.528
I didn't give him hemophilia.

54:31.904 --> 54:32.996
Murderer!

54:33.305 --> 54:36.069
- I'll never forgive you.
- You gave it to him! It was you!

54:36.442 --> 54:38.672
Don't you think I know it?

54:43.949 --> 54:45.883
When I see him bleed...

54:47.186 --> 54:48.778
...I think I did it...

54:49.588 --> 54:51.818
...as if I'd put a knife in him.

54:53.292 --> 54:55.487
I've tried to make up for it.

54:56.862 --> 55:00.855
I've seen so many specialists
and doctors and surgeons.

55:01.500 --> 55:03.559
Sometimes I did not tell you.

55:04.670 --> 55:06.900
I know most of them
were quacks...

55:08.507 --> 55:10.099
...but I still tried.

55:12.244 --> 55:14.974
I have spent nights
on my knees...

55:15.280 --> 55:16.247
...praying.

55:17.749 --> 55:20.547
And Rasputin's the only one...

55:20.886 --> 55:23.548
...who has helped me
bear my punishment.

55:25.724 --> 55:29.854
That's why I cling to this
common peasant from Siberia.

55:32.564 --> 55:34.725
They laugh at me
in the streets.

55:35.267 --> 55:37.599
You have turned against me.

55:39.338 --> 55:41.272
But I cannot help it.

55:42.174 --> 55:43.334
It's me.

55:44.143 --> 55:46.839
Whatever happens, I deserve it.

55:47.346 --> 55:49.143
It's my punishment.

55:50.082 --> 55:51.310
It's mine.

55:56.955 --> 55:59.753
Stalin's been sentenced
to Siberia again.

56:00.025 --> 56:00.992
What else?

56:02.694 --> 56:05.822
The Okrana's infiltrated
our cells in Moscow.

56:07.866 --> 56:10.664
They found all our
explosives in Minsk.

56:10.869 --> 56:12.166
Perhaps I should
go back to Petersburg.

56:12.905 --> 56:14.532
You didn't do
much good last time.

56:15.908 --> 56:16.806
What else is happening?

56:17.009 --> 56:20.604
Not much. Not since Rasputin
went back to Siberia.

56:20.812 --> 56:21.904
Yes, it's a pity.

56:22.114 --> 56:23.877
He can't cause
much trouble there.

56:24.216 --> 56:27.617
He was worth more than an army
of Bolsheviks in Petersburg.

56:28.487 --> 56:31.183
They've arrested
Sverdilov in Kiev.

56:33.192 --> 56:34.716
Spies everywhere.

56:35.527 --> 56:37.222
No one trusts anyone.

56:39.364 --> 56:43.061
Some of our party leaders
work for the Okrana.

56:49.074 --> 56:52.532
I see you were in the Minsk group
when it was raided.

56:53.812 --> 56:55.006
You got away?

56:55.914 --> 56:57.404
I managed to hide.

56:57.683 --> 56:59.548
And all the others
were caught?

57:02.287 --> 57:04.152
You got somewhere to live?

57:04.523 --> 57:06.320
Not five minutes away from here.

57:07.659 --> 57:08.626
Good.

57:08.860 --> 57:10.919
Thank you for bringing the message.

57:11.363 --> 57:13.126
Come and see us again soon.

57:13.599 --> 57:14.657
And don't drink.

57:14.866 --> 57:17.528
Too many of our men
take to drink in Paris.

57:20.038 --> 57:22.165
If Sverdilov's been arrested...

57:23.075 --> 57:24.633
He's a double agent.

57:25.277 --> 57:26.539
He works for the Okrana.

57:32.618 --> 57:33.550
Go home.

57:33.752 --> 57:35.344
I don't feel like
talking tonight.

57:35.554 --> 57:37.078
I've got nothing to say.

57:48.900 --> 57:49.889
We've got old.

57:51.303 --> 57:52.361
They've gone?

57:53.171 --> 57:54.138
I'll get your supper.

57:54.339 --> 57:56.705
That's all right.
There's no hurry.

57:58.076 --> 58:00.806
In the last ten years,
I've spent...

58:02.147 --> 58:03.842
...three months in Russia.

58:07.619 --> 58:09.143
I'm out of fashion.

58:10.489 --> 58:12.616
No one's wearing me this year.

58:13.892 --> 58:14.950
I talk...

58:16.061 --> 58:17.551
...and no one listens.
I write...

58:18.030 --> 58:19.691
...and no one reads.

58:22.067 --> 58:25.059
Think what we'll be like
in 10 or 15 years.

58:26.171 --> 58:28.935
Emigrés go off their heads
in the end, you know.

58:32.010 --> 58:35.537
Mad, old cranks with no money,
no country...

58:35.747 --> 58:38.011
...always worrying
about the laundry...

58:38.216 --> 58:40.616
...complaining when
the mail's late.

58:40.919 --> 58:44.013
Being ill in charity hospitals
and buried with the paupers.

58:44.222 --> 58:45.849
No, Ilyich.

58:46.058 --> 58:48.083
It won't be like that.

58:48.293 --> 58:50.625
Three hundred years
of Romanovs?

58:52.731 --> 58:54.926
Why not 300 more?

59:19.858 --> 59:22.349
Long live the Romanovs!

59:26.064 --> 59:28.624
Three hundred years!

59:44.616 --> 59:46.413
Come on! Come on!

01:00:10.175 --> 01:00:13.941
I didn't want to come on this
Tercentenary tour, Peter Arkadiavitch.

01:00:15.313 --> 01:00:18.680
But, God help me, I do love it
when they stand and wave.

01:01:15.407 --> 01:01:16.237
He's shot!

01:01:22.881 --> 01:01:24.849
Guards! Guards!
For God's sake, hurry!

01:01:45.504 --> 01:01:46.835
What's to be done?

01:01:51.576 --> 01:01:52.736
Is he dead?

01:01:53.011 --> 01:01:53.841
No.

01:01:54.613 --> 01:01:56.672
There's a lot of blood, pain.

01:01:57.616 --> 01:01:59.243
The doctors are with him.

01:02:00.118 --> 01:02:01.107
Good.

01:02:03.955 --> 01:02:05.252
He's a good man.

01:02:07.225 --> 01:02:09.022
They always kill the good men.

01:02:09.694 --> 01:02:11.685
The ones who help them most.

01:02:12.998 --> 01:02:14.829
They killed my grandfather.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.334
He freed the serfs, you know.

01:02:18.003 --> 01:02:20.335
He helped them.
So they threw a bomb.

01:02:22.707 --> 01:02:24.368
Stolypin's a good man.

01:02:28.313 --> 01:02:29.746
I can't find a match.

01:02:31.116 --> 01:02:33.107
They've got the man
who shot him.

01:02:33.318 --> 01:02:34.307
The man?

01:02:35.086 --> 01:02:37.179
Some kind of revolutionary.

01:02:39.791 --> 01:02:41.258
Damn them all.

01:02:42.494 --> 01:02:44.826
You help them and they
kill you for it.

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:47.894
Give them <i>Dumas</i>
and they give you bombs.

01:02:49.467 --> 01:02:51.662
I want them paid in kind.

01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:54.238
You understand me?

01:02:54.873 --> 01:02:56.534
I want something done!

01:02:59.544 --> 01:03:01.671
You bastard!

01:03:02.814 --> 01:03:03.644
This is our home!

01:03:03.848 --> 01:03:04.780
Not anymore!

01:03:04.983 --> 01:03:05.847
We live here!

01:03:10.155 --> 01:03:11.383
Arrest him.

01:03:26.471 --> 01:03:29.634
Tell the Tsar that
he can close this building...

01:03:29.841 --> 01:03:32.401
...but the <i>Duma</i> won't be closed.

01:03:37.482 --> 01:03:38.972
That's enough, Mr. Kerensky.

01:03:39.184 --> 01:03:41.675
No, it's not, Mr. Prime Minister.

01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:45.652
You cannot repress this body
and you cannot repress the people.

01:03:45.857 --> 01:03:48.325
That's the road to revolution.

01:03:48.793 --> 01:03:51.523
We're not revolutionaries here.

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:55.056
Most of us want a system
like the British.

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:56.961
Let there be a Tsar...

01:03:57.168 --> 01:04:00.296
...but let there be a parliament
with rights and powers.

01:04:00.505 --> 01:04:02.564
We won't be denied,
Mr. Kokovtsov.

01:04:02.774 --> 01:04:05.937
This government deplores
brutality and violence.

01:04:06.144 --> 01:04:08.009
But when dissent
gets out of hand...

01:04:08.213 --> 01:04:10.738
...when opposition ceases
to be peaceful...

01:04:10.949 --> 01:04:13.782
...law and order
must and will be kept.

01:04:14.019 --> 01:04:16.249
Not at this price!

01:04:17.055 --> 01:04:18.920
The <i>Duma</i> is not a street corner.

01:04:19.157 --> 01:04:21.318
There is no violence here.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.552
But even we are not free to speak.

01:04:23.762 --> 01:04:25.286
Where is the Tsar?

01:04:25.997 --> 01:04:28.124
The Tsar is at the
hunting lodge in Poland.

01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:31.734
I don't care if he's
in Scotland shooting grouse!

01:04:32.137 --> 01:04:35.504
Find him and tell him he's
bringing ruin on his head!

01:04:35.707 --> 01:04:37.675
Tell him while there's
still a Tsar to tell!

01:04:52.457 --> 01:04:53.788
You all right?

01:04:55.427 --> 01:04:58.191
Alexei, Alexei, mustn’t run
and mustn’t play!

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:00.996
Mustn’t jump and mustn’t climb.

01:05:03.101 --> 01:05:05.399
- You must be more careful.
- It was nothing.

01:05:05.837 --> 01:05:08.499
I will run away and
be an actress when I grow up.

01:05:08.707 --> 01:05:09.799
It's my destiny.

01:05:10.175 --> 01:05:13.872
Once you've felt the call
of the stage, you know.

01:05:14.079 --> 01:05:15.478
It's in your blood.

01:05:19.751 --> 01:05:21.616
A princess can't be an actress.

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.118
You may well say
you want to be a trollop.

01:05:24.322 --> 01:05:25.983
What's a trollop?

01:05:26.891 --> 01:05:28.290
Trollop.
Yes, that sounds nice.

01:05:28.493 --> 01:05:30.324
Perhaps I'll be a trollop instead.

01:05:30.528 --> 01:05:33.429
Monsieur Gilliard,
what's French for trollop?

01:05:36.968 --> 01:05:39.801
I'll marry a prince
and have eight children.

01:05:40.004 --> 01:05:41.995
Ten, if he's really nice.

01:05:42.574 --> 01:05:44.337
How many will you have, Olga?

01:05:44.542 --> 01:05:46.237
What's the use in daydreaming?

01:05:47.145 --> 01:05:50.171
I should like to be a teacher
when I grow up.

01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:53.350
Teaching is such a noble profession.

01:05:54.686 --> 01:05:56.916
That's Monsieur Gilliard!

01:05:57.989 --> 01:06:00.082
Do you think I've caught his eyes?

01:06:00.291 --> 01:06:01.690
Monsieur Gilliard...

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:06.087
...how do you say smouldering
in French?

01:06:10.235 --> 01:06:11.793
You silly, stupid child!

01:06:30.388 --> 01:06:31.446
Think of it.

01:06:32.857 --> 01:06:35.451
Russian princesses performing
an English play in French...

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.685
...for an audience
of Polish nobles.

01:06:38.396 --> 01:06:40.421
I hope somebody understands it.

01:06:41.766 --> 01:06:43.734
At least we have
the day to ourselves.

01:06:44.169 --> 01:06:45.067
Mother...

01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:46.667
...I'm bleeding.

01:06:47.138 --> 01:06:48.298
Dear God!

01:06:51.709 --> 01:06:53.233
How far is it back to Spala?

01:06:53.578 --> 01:06:54.545
Two or three miles.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.043
As fast as you can go!

01:07:27.579 --> 01:07:28.477
Well?

01:07:29.948 --> 01:07:32.416
It's a most severe attack.

01:07:32.817 --> 01:07:35.149
The hemorrhaging
may last for days.

01:07:35.954 --> 01:07:38.422
I cabled the specialists
in Petersburg.

01:07:38.623 --> 01:07:40.557
They won't reach here
until tomorrow night.

01:07:40.758 --> 01:07:41.986
And the pain?

01:07:42.193 --> 01:07:43.854
It comes in waves.

01:07:44.596 --> 01:07:47.759
His fever's high.
There may be complications.

01:07:49.968 --> 01:07:51.936
All we can do
is watch and wait.

01:07:54.339 --> 01:07:56.136
He will recover, won't he?

01:07:57.108 --> 01:07:58.666
He's a strong boy.

01:08:03.615 --> 01:08:05.207
He really is, you know.

01:08:05.783 --> 01:08:07.375
The swelling...

01:08:07.886 --> 01:08:09.251
Did you see?

01:08:10.822 --> 01:08:12.312
I hate this house.

01:08:12.757 --> 01:08:15.021
Of all the godforsaken places.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:20.224
Our guests.

01:08:20.999 --> 01:08:22.761
What shall I say?

01:08:23.701 --> 01:08:25.635
God. I'd forgotten.

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:35.167
I'm not sure I can manage.

01:08:36.147 --> 01:08:39.947
As long as we are here,
no one will ever know about Alexis.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:35.200
I think it's best to wait.

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:39.140
But if you wait, he may die.

01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:42.703
This is the heir
to all the Russians.

01:09:43.247 --> 01:09:46.113
Would you want his body
on your operating table?

01:09:50.388 --> 01:09:52.912
You could not have chosen
a worse time.

01:09:53.124 --> 01:09:55.251
My son, as we sit here,
is with the doctors.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.122
I didn't choose it, sire.
It was forced on me.

01:09:58.329 --> 01:10:00.820
I beg Your Majesty
to understand.

01:10:01.699 --> 01:10:03.257
Get on with it.

01:10:03.501 --> 01:10:06.231
There must, in my opinion,
be a change in policy.

01:10:06.604 --> 01:10:09.164
Two hundred strikers
have been shot at Lena.

01:10:09.374 --> 01:10:12.537
At this rate, we'll soon
have a million workers on strike.

01:10:12.744 --> 01:10:14.439
We can't shoot them all.

01:10:14.946 --> 01:10:17.574
The <i>Duma</i> must be reconvened.

01:10:17.782 --> 01:10:20.478
Just leave your papers.
I'll read them when I can.

01:10:20.685 --> 01:10:22.380
I need some answers now.

01:10:22.587 --> 01:10:23.781
I haven't any now.

01:10:23.988 --> 01:10:25.182
Your Majesty, I must insist!

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:26.755
Stay here, go back to Petersburg.

01:10:26.958 --> 01:10:28.516
I don't care what you do!

01:10:29.527 --> 01:10:31.825
They want their <i>Duma...</i>

01:10:32.597 --> 01:10:34.087
...give it back to them!

01:10:34.298 --> 01:10:36.289
I hope to God they rot in it!

01:10:36.501 --> 01:10:37.365
As for...

01:10:51.249 --> 01:10:53.046
They think it best to wait.

01:10:54.252 --> 01:10:55.378
That's all?

01:10:57.288 --> 01:10:58.414
What for?

01:10:59.357 --> 01:11:00.517
What are they waiting for?

01:11:01.859 --> 01:11:02.791
Developments.

01:11:04.128 --> 01:11:04.992
I see.

01:11:06.597 --> 01:11:08.827
And how long will the wait be?

01:11:43.668 --> 01:11:45.033
I want our friend.

01:11:47.672 --> 01:11:49.469
The prime minister's been here.

01:11:51.309 --> 01:11:53.072
He says they've shot more strikers.

01:11:53.277 --> 01:11:56.110
I can't even remember
how many this time.

01:11:57.215 --> 01:11:59.445
We decided something important.

01:12:01.018 --> 01:12:02.212
Oh, yes.

01:12:02.987 --> 01:12:04.011
The <i>Duma.</i>

01:12:05.456 --> 01:12:07.720
I want this message sent now.

01:12:08.059 --> 01:12:09.890
I want Father Gregory.

01:12:10.128 --> 01:12:12.358
I was too young
when Father died.

01:12:13.998 --> 01:12:15.659
You were 26.

01:12:21.739 --> 01:12:23.400
I want our friend.

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:28.809
If he's at home and starts tonight,
the trip will take a week.

01:12:29.013 --> 01:12:30.446
It's senseless.

01:12:30.715 --> 01:12:32.012
Send it.

01:12:33.084 --> 01:12:34.415
A funny thing.

01:12:35.186 --> 01:12:36.676
My son is dying...

01:12:37.922 --> 01:12:39.913
...and I can't cry.

01:12:41.993 --> 01:12:43.824
When your father died...

01:12:44.495 --> 01:12:46.554
...you wept for days.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.531
You never knew.

01:12:51.802 --> 01:12:53.463
I never said...

01:12:54.138 --> 01:12:56.800
...how I felt listening
to you sobbing...

01:12:58.242 --> 01:13:00.904
...telling everyone
how afraid you were.

01:13:02.113 --> 01:13:04.547
Most men are men at 21.

01:13:06.651 --> 01:13:08.983
You made me so ashamed.

01:13:10.388 --> 01:13:11.946
All right.

01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:25.825
In the name of the Father...

01:13:26.337 --> 01:13:27.827
...and of the Son...

01:13:28.639 --> 01:13:30.698
...and of the Holy Ghost...

01:13:31.142 --> 01:13:32.234
...amen.

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:41.750
"The Tsarevitch has been taken ill.

01:13:41.953 --> 01:13:46.117
The heir's condition
is considered to be grave.

01:13:46.324 --> 01:13:49.350
His response to treatment
so far..."

01:13:50.528 --> 01:13:53.497
This one for midday
to announce...

01:13:53.698 --> 01:13:54.892
...a severe relapse.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.726
And one...

01:13:56.968 --> 01:13:58.959
...for tomorrow night.

01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:01.531
The final bulletin.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.332
I see.

01:14:05.076 --> 01:14:06.407
As to the funeral plans...

01:14:06.811 --> 01:14:08.142
For God's sake, Vladimir!

01:14:09.247 --> 01:14:10.874
But you need to know.

01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:15.612
The funeral train...

01:14:16.053 --> 01:14:18.385
...will consist of 11...

01:14:18.689 --> 01:14:19.553
...cars.

01:14:21.259 --> 01:14:23.090
You should try to sleep.

01:14:23.294 --> 01:14:24.124
No.

01:14:25.296 --> 01:14:27.059
Some tea, at least.

01:14:29.567 --> 01:14:30.591
It's come!

01:14:30.801 --> 01:14:31.995
He's answered.

01:14:32.403 --> 01:14:33.233
Listen.

01:14:34.071 --> 01:14:37.040
"God has seen your tears
and heard your prayers.

01:14:37.241 --> 01:14:38.299
Do not grieve.

01:14:38.509 --> 01:14:40.272
The little one will not die.

01:14:41.078 --> 01:14:42.409
Do not let the doctors
bother him.

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:44.072
Be at peace.

01:14:44.282 --> 01:14:47.877
I am leaving immediately
and will be at your side soon."

01:14:49.086 --> 01:14:50.576
He's not to be disturbed.

01:14:50.788 --> 01:14:51.755
I want your promise.

01:14:51.956 --> 01:14:52.786
But, Your Majesty...

01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:54.582
No more doctors.

01:14:54.992 --> 01:14:56.983
I can bar the door if need be.

01:15:00.031 --> 01:15:01.692
I can sleep now.

01:15:09.573 --> 01:15:11.404
All is well, my darling.

01:15:21.686 --> 01:15:24.177
Will it make any difference
if Alexis is left alone?

01:15:25.956 --> 01:15:27.480
No, I suppose not.

01:15:51.682 --> 01:15:53.650
Alexei likes me best in rubies.

01:15:53.851 --> 01:15:55.842
Come. We'll see him now.

01:16:11.035 --> 01:16:12.468
Good morning, my darling.

01:16:17.108 --> 01:16:18.700
Good morning, Mother.

01:16:47.071 --> 01:16:49.301
Good day, and the Lord be with you.

01:16:54.145 --> 01:16:56.113
And the Lord be with you!

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.787
It's all right, baby.
We're here. It's all right.

01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:15.424
- Blood!
- Why do you have such nasty dreams?

01:18:15.626 --> 01:18:18.060
I heard a gun.
There was blood everywhere.

01:18:20.231 --> 01:18:22.927
You were dreaming about
Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

01:18:23.501 --> 01:18:26.334
It was nothing.
I had a dream.

01:18:27.638 --> 01:18:31.005
If you had a dream,
let's talk about it.

01:18:35.513 --> 01:18:37.743
Are you all right now, Alexei?

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:43.281
Franz Ferdinand's assassination
is bad for Austria and the Serbs...

01:18:43.654 --> 01:18:46.316
...and for the assassin
and his family.

01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:49.058
But politics is like that
in the Balkans.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.352
The English vote
and the Serbs assassinate.

01:18:53.130 --> 01:18:55.030
You see, Serbia wants its freedom.

01:18:55.232 --> 01:18:57.757
Austria won't give it to them
and so this happens.

01:18:58.035 --> 01:18:59.559
It has happened here.

01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:02.204
- They threw a bomb...
- Nicky, it's so late.

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:04.440
They're not children anymore.

01:19:04.642 --> 01:19:06.940
They must accept these things.

01:19:07.778 --> 01:19:11.305
Grandfather was killed by a bomb.
So was Uncle Sergei.

01:19:11.815 --> 01:19:14.113
But Serbia is a long way off.

01:19:15.085 --> 01:19:18.418
And we don't need
to have bad dreams about Archdukes.

01:19:18.822 --> 01:19:20.881
The diplomats will send
some angry notes.

01:19:21.091 --> 01:19:25.619
A few generals will go on exercises
and everyone will be sensible again.

01:19:26.530 --> 01:19:30.523
All over Europe, kings and queens
are sleeping safely in their beds.

01:19:30.734 --> 01:19:32.759
And that's what we're going to do.

01:19:48.252 --> 01:19:49.981
Your Majesty must not.

01:19:50.187 --> 01:19:52.519
This is only a partial mobilization.

01:19:52.723 --> 01:19:55.214
It is against Austria,
not Germany, nor anyone else.

01:19:55.993 --> 01:19:58.860
If Russia mobilizes,
there will be a war.

01:19:59.063 --> 01:20:00.724
The Austrians are shelling Belgrade.

01:20:00.931 --> 01:20:02.592
We must be ready to defend ourselves.

01:20:03.334 --> 01:20:06.030
I'm ordering prayers for peace
to be said in all the churches.

01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:09.103
But now I must see my ministers
for armaments and recruitment.

01:20:09.306 --> 01:20:11.069
It is in our hands, not God's.

01:20:11.775 --> 01:20:13.402
He gave us minds to reason.

01:20:13.777 --> 01:20:16.678
We can talk sanity to lunatics.
We can calm mad dogs.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.405
God help us if we
have to start praying!

01:20:19.617 --> 01:20:21.642
We can pray when we bury the dead!

01:20:37.868 --> 01:20:40.632
Here is some wonderful news.
A telegram from the Kaiser.

01:20:40.838 --> 01:20:42.169
Just what we wanted.

01:20:42.373 --> 01:20:44.933
Offering to mediate
between us and Austria.

01:20:45.142 --> 01:20:47.133
I knew I could count on Willy.

01:20:48.078 --> 01:20:49.067
You see?

01:20:50.247 --> 01:20:53.148
He's signed it, "Your sincere and
devoted friend and cousin, Willy."

01:20:54.118 --> 01:20:56.643
With due respect
to your cousin, sire...

01:20:56.854 --> 01:20:58.879
...the Kaiser is a deceitful...

01:20:59.423 --> 01:21:00.754
...megalomaniac.

01:21:00.958 --> 01:21:02.721
If he is offering to help...

01:21:02.926 --> 01:21:04.894
...then it is time to pray.

01:21:05.195 --> 01:21:06.457
They won't last a week.

01:21:06.664 --> 01:21:09.292
We'll bury the German army and
that pansy of a Kaiser...

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.127
...and be home for Christmas.

01:21:13.837 --> 01:21:15.134
Colonel Volkov.

01:21:15.539 --> 01:21:18.975
Inform the staff that the situation
has improved greatly.

01:21:19.176 --> 01:21:20.575
I'll brief them fully
in half an hour.

01:21:20.778 --> 01:21:23.975
But shall we continue to prepare
for the general mobilization?

01:21:24.181 --> 01:21:25.614
In case?

01:21:26.784 --> 01:21:29.014
I'll brief you fully
in half an hour.

01:21:29.219 --> 01:21:32.120
We can't run a modern war, sir.

01:21:32.456 --> 01:21:34.924
We're not fighting
Napoleon this time.

01:21:35.125 --> 01:21:38.253
Germany has ten miles
of railway to every one of ours.

01:21:38.462 --> 01:21:40.828
They have 100 factories
to every one of ours.

01:21:41.031 --> 01:21:42.726
All we have is men.

01:21:42.933 --> 01:21:44.867
They'll be slaughtered like flies.

01:21:45.335 --> 01:21:48.304
We have 11/2 million
men in uniform.

01:21:48.739 --> 01:21:52.004
Next week we'll have
41/2 million men in uniform.

01:21:52.276 --> 01:21:55.973
At a casualty rate of 20%
wounded and 10% killed...

01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.307
...we can maintain an army
of five million men.

01:21:58.515 --> 01:22:00.278
The Kaiser can't beat that.

01:22:00.584 --> 01:22:02.745
Austria wants to humiliate us.

01:22:02.953 --> 01:22:05.012
We must show her we'll be firm.

01:22:05.322 --> 01:22:08.450
We need the mobilization or your
government will be outmaneuvered.

01:22:09.126 --> 01:22:12.459
But if we mobilize,
the Kaiser will have to.

01:22:12.663 --> 01:22:14.654
And France, and England.

01:22:14.865 --> 01:22:16.389
Nobody will be able to stop.

01:22:19.937 --> 01:22:23.065
Send a telegram to the Kaiser
with a message from me.

01:22:23.273 --> 01:22:26.606
Say that though we've both mobilized,
it doesn't mean we'll fight.

01:22:26.877 --> 01:22:28.344
And nothing will break
our old friendship.

01:22:28.545 --> 01:22:29.842
Sign it "Nicky."

01:22:35.953 --> 01:22:37.818
Order the general mobilization.

01:22:40.491 --> 01:22:41.651
Madness.

01:22:47.798 --> 01:22:50.926
This one can't get to the colors
soon enough, can you?

01:22:57.508 --> 01:22:58.998
I'm old, sir.

01:23:00.043 --> 01:23:02.238
I've seen so many wars.

01:23:03.113 --> 01:23:06.173
They all seemed so
important at the time.

01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:07.882
Now...

01:23:08.719 --> 01:23:11.347
...I don't even remember
what they were called.

01:23:12.289 --> 01:23:13.483
Millions...

01:23:13.957 --> 01:23:15.424
...of dead men.

01:23:17.461 --> 01:23:19.122
I don't know why.

01:23:19.596 --> 01:23:20.893
Nobody knows.

01:23:26.503 --> 01:23:29.233
You could so easily
stop this war, sir.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.035
All you have to do
is to get up...

01:23:32.242 --> 01:23:33.436
...now...

01:23:33.744 --> 01:23:34.870
...quietly...

01:23:35.078 --> 01:23:36.943
...go home to your family.

01:23:38.816 --> 01:23:41.979
You'd be the greatest
of all the Tsars.

01:23:51.295 --> 01:23:54.128
Your Majesty's foreign minister,
Mr. Sazanov...

01:23:54.331 --> 01:23:56.993
...has received a note
from the German Ambassador.

01:24:00.437 --> 01:24:01.461
Your Majesty...

01:24:01.672 --> 01:24:03.833
...at ten minutes past seven
this evening...

01:24:04.041 --> 01:24:05.906
...Germany declared war on Russia.

01:24:25.963 --> 01:24:27.089
Gentlemen...

01:24:28.665 --> 01:24:30.860
...Germany has declared war on Russia.

01:24:33.136 --> 01:24:34.398
God save Russia!

01:24:35.873 --> 01:24:37.966
God save the Tsar.

01:24:38.275 --> 01:24:40.505
God save the Tsar!

01:25:06.236 --> 01:25:08.136
None of you will be here...

01:25:08.338 --> 01:25:10.101
...when this war ends.

01:25:10.307 --> 01:25:13.504
Everything we fought for
will be lost.

01:25:13.710 --> 01:25:17.009
Everything we loved
will be broken.

01:25:17.481 --> 01:25:21.417
The victors will be as cursed
as the defeated.

01:25:21.618 --> 01:25:24.212
The world will grow old.

01:25:24.421 --> 01:25:27.288
And men will wander about,
lost in the ruins...

01:25:27.491 --> 01:25:28.958
...and go mad.

01:25:29.359 --> 01:25:30.656
Tradition.

01:25:31.094 --> 01:25:32.391
Virtue.

01:25:32.829 --> 01:25:34.160
Restraint.

01:25:34.531 --> 01:25:35.759
They all go!

01:25:35.933 --> 01:25:39.369
I'm not mourning for myself,
but for the people who come after me.

01:25:39.569 --> 01:25:42.060
They will live without hope.

01:25:43.006 --> 01:25:44.530
And all they will have...

01:25:44.741 --> 01:25:46.208
...will be guilt...

01:25:46.410 --> 01:25:47.741
...revenge...

01:25:48.111 --> 01:25:49.408
...and terror.

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.875
And the world will
be full of fanatics...

01:25:54.151 --> 01:25:57.052
...and trivial fools.

01:25:59.523 --> 01:26:02.048
Set all differences aside!

01:26:02.426 --> 01:26:04.519
We are Russians first of all!

01:26:04.728 --> 01:26:07.094
And until the day of victory dawns...

01:26:07.297 --> 01:26:09.060
...we stand united...

01:26:09.266 --> 01:26:11.393
...in the defense of Holy Russia!

01:27:16.833 --> 01:27:18.664
God save the Tsar!

01:32:46.529 --> 01:32:49.554
- There's no transport. Can they walk?
- Yes, sir.

01:32:49.699 --> 01:32:52.862
They're needed at the front tonight.
See to it.

01:32:55.572 --> 01:32:57.039
Right face!

01:32:58.341 --> 01:33:00.104
Forward march!

01:34:08.545 --> 01:34:10.274
Bitch! German bitch!

01:34:10.647 --> 01:34:11.739
Shut up!

01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:26.255
Have you seen them?
What happened?

01:34:26.463 --> 01:34:27.930
Would you like some tea?

01:34:29.199 --> 01:34:32.049
I've always hated this time of year.
It gets dark so early.

01:34:32.110 --> 01:34:34.932
Oh, Niki!
You gave in again.

01:34:35.138 --> 01:34:36.435
You look so tired.

01:34:36.639 --> 01:34:38.368
Did you even see the ministers?

01:34:38.575 --> 01:34:40.270
You want the minutes
of the meeting?

01:34:40.477 --> 01:34:41.876
Just the gist of it.

01:34:42.078 --> 01:34:44.876
I told them I proposed replacing
Nikolasha with myself...

01:34:45.081 --> 01:34:47.379
...and was leaving for headquarters
to take command.

01:34:47.584 --> 01:34:49.074
Go on. They said...?

01:34:49.285 --> 01:34:51.810
Nothing much.
They said they'd all resign.

01:34:52.188 --> 01:34:54.452
They said the government would fall,
that it was madness.

01:34:54.657 --> 01:34:55.487
And you took it?

01:34:55.859 --> 01:34:57.349
- You gave in?
- They're my advisors.

01:34:57.727 --> 01:34:58.591
You're their Tsar.

01:34:58.962 --> 01:35:02.398
But what if they're right?
They might be. How can I be sure?

01:35:02.599 --> 01:35:03.759
You must go.

01:35:04.133 --> 01:35:07.432
Nikolasha is a bad man.
Father Gregory has said so.

01:35:08.071 --> 01:35:09.971
I'm sick to death of Father Gregory.

01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:12.300
All my life...

01:35:13.243 --> 01:35:15.404
...my whole life, I've
done what you want.

01:35:15.612 --> 01:35:16.636
I gave Mother up.

01:35:16.846 --> 01:35:19.212
You hated her, so we don't
see her anymore.

01:35:19.415 --> 01:35:21.042
I gave my friends up.

01:35:21.384 --> 01:35:23.249
Do you know I haven't a single friend?

01:35:23.987 --> 01:35:25.545
I've got my family.

01:35:26.055 --> 01:35:27.989
Four girls, one sick boy...

01:35:29.392 --> 01:35:30.518
...and you.

01:35:31.728 --> 01:35:32.558
I ask...

01:35:32.896 --> 01:35:36.798
...before I eat or sleep
or change my clothes:

01:35:37.066 --> 01:35:38.499
"Is this what Sunny wants?"

01:35:39.235 --> 01:35:40.463
And it never is.

01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:42.137
There's always more!

01:35:42.705 --> 01:35:44.400
Sweet Jesus! How much
do you want of me?

01:35:45.642 --> 01:35:46.506
I want this.

01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:47.869
Don't you know I want to go?

01:35:48.511 --> 01:35:50.672
For months there's
been no ammunition.

01:35:51.381 --> 01:35:53.941
In Galicia, they ration bullets.
Three a day.

01:35:54.150 --> 01:35:57.313
My soldiers get three shots a day!
What can I do?

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:59.181
I can't make shells.

01:35:59.389 --> 01:36:00.515
I fire ministers...

01:36:00.723 --> 01:36:03.089
...I hire ministers,
and nothing happens.

01:36:03.293 --> 01:36:05.693
I'm no use here.
I belong at Stavka with my men!

01:36:05.895 --> 01:36:08.762
Don't tell me.
Tell your ministers.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:12.727
You know people want me
to divorce you?

01:36:14.571 --> 01:36:16.061
Father Gregory warned me of that.

01:36:17.006 --> 01:36:19.531
If I thought it would help,
I would go away.

01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:21.337
But it would be disastrous.

01:36:22.946 --> 01:36:25.244
Has Father Gregory told you that too?

01:36:26.516 --> 01:36:29.542
I don't need anyone to tell me about us.

01:36:33.323 --> 01:36:35.848
This is the beginning
of the glory of your reign.

01:36:36.059 --> 01:36:37.686
Our friend told me so.

01:36:37.994 --> 01:36:40.428
It will be the greatest page
in Russian history...

01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:43.121
...the story of these weeks and days.

01:36:43.333 --> 01:36:44.561
And when you go...

01:36:44.767 --> 01:36:47.600
...don't worry over what
you've left behind. I'm here.

01:36:48.237 --> 01:36:49.602
Lean on me.

01:36:49.839 --> 01:36:50.999
Use me.

01:36:52.308 --> 01:36:54.799
I'm not wise or strong...

01:36:55.111 --> 01:36:57.306
...but God will show me what to do.

01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00.906
With our armies in retreat,
you must not take command.

01:37:01.117 --> 01:37:03.881
You could not have chosen
a more unfortunate time.

01:37:04.087 --> 01:37:05.213
Faith in Your Majesty...

01:37:05.421 --> 01:37:08.083
...is the one thing that keeps
the whole country together.

01:37:10.493 --> 01:37:11.892
Have I heard it all?

01:37:12.095 --> 01:37:15.758
One thing. The headquarters
at Stavka is 500 miles from here.

01:37:16.165 --> 01:37:17.291
Go on.

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.730
While you're away,
who will run the government?

01:37:20.136 --> 01:37:22.832
When the Tsar is with the Army,
the Tsaritza takes his place.

01:37:23.806 --> 01:37:24.670
Sire!

01:37:25.308 --> 01:37:28.709
With all respects, the Tsaritza's
lack of experience...

01:37:28.911 --> 01:37:32.642
...and limited understanding of the
Russian people, gracious though she...

01:37:32.849 --> 01:37:34.680
I shall continue to make
the decisions...

01:37:34.884 --> 01:37:37.079
...but you'll have to make
your reports to her.

01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:43.122
Thank you for your advice, gentlemen.

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.825
I have thought about this.

01:37:46.896 --> 01:37:49.194
And I know that God is with me.

01:37:50.299 --> 01:37:52.563
I leave for Stavka in the morning.

01:37:57.607 --> 01:37:59.734
<i>My very own darling...</i>

01:38:00.076 --> 01:38:02.772
<i>...remember last night</i>
<i>when we were together.</i>

01:38:03.179 --> 01:38:05.443
<i>I yearn for your caresses.</i>

01:38:05.648 --> 01:38:07.775
<i>I can never have enough of them.</i>

01:38:08.418 --> 01:38:10.079
<i>I kiss you, caress you...</i>

01:38:10.286 --> 01:38:12.686
<i>...love you, long for you...</i>

01:38:12.889 --> 01:38:14.686
<i>...can't sleep without you.</i>

01:38:14.891 --> 01:38:16.222
<i>Bless you...</i>

01:38:16.693 --> 01:38:17.625
<i>...Sunny.</i>

01:38:35.078 --> 01:38:36.636
Get up. We're moving out.

01:38:37.847 --> 01:38:39.474
I said get up!

01:39:16.552 --> 01:39:17.780
Your Majesty.

01:39:29.999 --> 01:39:31.933
You can't be glad to see me.

01:39:33.069 --> 01:39:34.934
You understand my reasons?

01:39:36.672 --> 01:39:38.037
You think I'm wrong.

01:39:38.541 --> 01:39:40.270
The Tsar comes second after God.

01:39:40.476 --> 01:39:42.034
I would die for him.

01:39:42.245 --> 01:39:43.439
I'm sorry, Nikolasha.

01:39:43.646 --> 01:39:46.547
Don't be.
It's a great relief.

01:39:47.150 --> 01:39:49.675
Can't get away
from here soon enough.

01:39:51.087 --> 01:39:53.351
I've appointed General Alexeiev
Chief of Staff.

01:39:53.556 --> 01:39:55.717
Good man, first class.

01:39:55.925 --> 01:39:57.517
Listen to him.
Let him run things.

01:39:57.727 --> 01:39:58.955
I intend to.

01:39:59.695 --> 01:40:01.629
Can't do worse than I did.

01:40:05.401 --> 01:40:06.459
You know...

01:40:08.638 --> 01:40:11.732
...I've got a million corpses
on my hands.

01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:17.471
I weep too easily these days.
Getting old.

01:40:18.047 --> 01:40:20.709
It's bitter, Nicky. Bitter.

01:40:23.085 --> 01:40:24.985
I don't envy you.

01:40:26.656 --> 01:40:28.089
What do you think I should do?

01:40:28.291 --> 01:40:31.260
Retreat. Preserve the Army.
That's the only thing.

01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:32.654
And what else?

01:40:32.862 --> 01:40:34.659
Wear socks to bed.

01:40:34.864 --> 01:40:36.229
Floors freeze in the winter.

01:40:36.432 --> 01:40:38.525
I'll ask Sunny to knit me some.

01:40:38.734 --> 01:40:40.599
She sends her love.

01:40:40.803 --> 01:40:42.634
The devil she does!

01:40:43.206 --> 01:40:46.573
I could have won this war if
I were only fighting on one front.

01:40:46.776 --> 01:40:48.835
But I had two enemies at my back:

01:40:49.045 --> 01:40:51.309
Your Sunny and her monk!

01:40:51.814 --> 01:40:53.145
Not long ago he wrote to me...

01:40:53.349 --> 01:40:55.613
...could he come
and bless the troops?

01:40:55.818 --> 01:40:57.945
I told him if he came, I'd hang him.

01:40:58.154 --> 01:40:59.746
Should have let him come.

01:40:59.956 --> 01:41:01.981
Hung the bastard when he got here.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.901
God help you, Nicky.

01:41:24.981 --> 01:41:26.881
God save the Tsar!

01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:29.878
God save the Tsar!

01:41:32.822 --> 01:41:35.188
So, you'd like to be an opera singer?

01:41:35.391 --> 01:41:37.518
Yes, you have the chest for it.

01:41:42.198 --> 01:41:44.496
Have you ever sung in public before?

01:41:47.637 --> 01:41:49.264
Go to the Imperial Theater...

01:41:49.472 --> 01:41:50.439
...give them this.

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:51.971
It's an introduction.

01:41:52.174 --> 01:41:54.768
I have them printed up
now to save time.

01:41:56.746 --> 01:41:58.077
Father Gregory.

01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:04.845
There's a gentleman arrived,
says he's the Minister of something.

01:42:05.087 --> 01:42:06.645
Foreign Minister.

01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:08.855
He's early.

01:42:09.725 --> 01:42:10.851
Send him in.

01:42:11.093 --> 01:42:12.583
He might enjoy this.

01:42:14.997 --> 01:42:17.557
Now let's hear you sing a little.

01:42:18.567 --> 01:42:19.829
Don't worry.

01:42:20.202 --> 01:42:21.567
I'm no judge.

01:42:22.939 --> 01:42:25.066
Father Gregory says come in.

01:42:29.178 --> 01:42:32.944
Has the Empress now made him
responsible for the arts?

01:42:36.686 --> 01:42:38.381
My dear man!

01:42:38.754 --> 01:42:40.722
Isn't she delightful?

01:42:46.028 --> 01:42:47.825
Absolutely charming.

01:42:48.497 --> 01:42:50.795
I had no idea you had
asked me here for a recital.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.433
She wants to sing.

01:42:52.702 --> 01:42:54.567
I like to help people.

01:42:55.671 --> 01:42:56.729
You don't mind?

01:42:56.939 --> 01:43:00.272
You've placed 3 men in my Ministry
who can neither read nor write.

01:43:00.476 --> 01:43:02.376
Why should I mind?

01:43:03.779 --> 01:43:05.644
I don't hate anyone...

01:43:05.948 --> 01:43:08.246
...and yet so many enemies.

01:43:08.784 --> 01:43:09.978
I'm not rich.

01:43:10.186 --> 01:43:12.086
What I get, I give away.

01:43:13.089 --> 01:43:16.183
I take no vengeance on the men
I've removed from office.

01:43:16.392 --> 01:43:19.384
When you fall, I won't abuse you.

01:43:19.662 --> 01:43:21.857
We are appointed and
dismissed by the Tsar.

01:43:22.064 --> 01:43:23.588
You're his enemy!

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.436
You and all the other ministers.
You're all against him.

01:43:27.636 --> 01:43:31.595
Can it be your dream to
have us all removed from office?

01:43:32.108 --> 01:43:32.938
Every one.

01:43:35.044 --> 01:43:37.512
You are destroying Russia!

01:43:37.713 --> 01:43:39.146
Don't you know it?

01:43:39.348 --> 01:43:40.280
What's your price?

01:43:40.483 --> 01:43:42.280
Do you want to be
made a pope or...

01:43:42.485 --> 01:43:45.045
Grishka! How are
the miracles going today?

01:43:45.955 --> 01:43:47.013
My God!

01:43:47.623 --> 01:43:49.853
They're elevating
Grishka to the Cabinet.

01:43:50.059 --> 01:43:52.653
Grand Duke Dmitry.
Prince Yussoupov.

01:43:52.862 --> 01:43:53.794
Pray excuse me.

01:43:53.996 --> 01:43:56.464
He tells me
I'm destroying Russia.

01:43:57.433 --> 01:43:58.866
What, single-handed?

01:43:59.068 --> 01:44:02.504
If you're friends of his, take him away.
Get him out of Petersburg.

01:44:03.172 --> 01:44:05.606
Take your girls, or your boys.

01:44:05.875 --> 01:44:07.206
Frolic in the provinces...

01:44:07.410 --> 01:44:08.843
...but get him out of here!

01:44:09.045 --> 01:44:11.343
Your Excellency sounds hysterical.

01:44:11.547 --> 01:44:13.242
Your Highness ought to be.

01:44:13.449 --> 01:44:14.939
Whatever happens, I'll survive.

01:44:15.151 --> 01:44:17.642
There's always room
for one more bureaucrat.

01:44:17.853 --> 01:44:19.320
I'll survive...

01:44:19.855 --> 01:44:21.584
...but will you princes?

01:44:21.791 --> 01:44:22.780
No.

01:44:23.793 --> 01:44:25.920
We're going to be
torn to pieces.

01:44:26.328 --> 01:44:28.057
You politicians think
you're in control...

01:44:28.264 --> 01:44:30.289
...but you'll be swept away
like the rest of us.

01:44:30.499 --> 01:44:32.023
Rome, Athens...

01:44:32.234 --> 01:44:33.997
...Petersburg.
You can't stop it.

01:44:34.637 --> 01:44:36.969
In the meantime,
I shall enjoy myself.

01:44:38.607 --> 01:44:40.472
Come to my place on Thursday.

01:44:41.343 --> 01:44:43.334
I'm having a special little party.

01:44:44.213 --> 01:44:45.043
Look.

01:44:46.882 --> 01:44:48.611
This beautiful scarf.

01:44:50.419 --> 01:44:51.386
Have it.

01:44:56.358 --> 01:44:58.189
I can't stop the revolution.

01:44:58.794 --> 01:45:01.422
But until it comes,
let's have some fun.

01:45:02.264 --> 01:45:03.663
Even if it's only
for a few more days.

01:45:03.866 --> 01:45:04.890
For God's sake!

01:45:06.202 --> 01:45:08.033
Look, if I brought you money...

01:45:08.237 --> 01:45:10.728
...if it were enough,
would you leave Petersburg?

01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:12.601
I can't leave.

01:45:13.642 --> 01:45:16.805
I want to serve
<i>Batushka</i> and <i>Matushka.</i>

01:45:17.012 --> 01:45:18.172
I want peace...

01:45:18.447 --> 01:45:20.972
...and food for
peasants everywhere.

01:45:21.450 --> 01:45:23.281
I want that girl you saw...

01:45:23.486 --> 01:45:25.681
...and all the girls
I haven't seen.

01:45:25.888 --> 01:45:27.378
I want to sleep...

01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:29.956
...but can't sleep
unless I'm drunk.

01:45:30.159 --> 01:45:32.218
I want to die and go to Heaven.

01:45:32.428 --> 01:45:33.554
I want music.

01:45:33.762 --> 01:45:37.163
I want God to love me
and I want to see you dance!

01:45:52.681 --> 01:45:53.841
Hello, Mama.

01:45:59.155 --> 01:46:01.988
This is my Commander in Chief,
General Alexeiev.

01:46:06.762 --> 01:46:08.559
How are Sunny and the children?

01:46:09.598 --> 01:46:12.294
This is the first Christmas
I've spent away from the family.

01:46:12.535 --> 01:46:13.729
You look well.

01:46:14.603 --> 01:46:16.867
I came to congratulate you, Nicky.

01:46:17.072 --> 01:46:18.130
What for?

01:46:18.574 --> 01:46:21.839
For finding from all Russia's
countless cretins...

01:46:22.044 --> 01:46:23.636
...idiots and incompetents...

01:46:23.846 --> 01:46:27.441
...the men least qualified
to run your government.

01:46:32.354 --> 01:46:35.118
- Would you like some tea?
- I've taken tea.

01:46:38.794 --> 01:46:41.786
I've tried to understand you,
but I can't.

01:46:42.398 --> 01:46:44.229
I sometimes fail to judge men well.

01:46:44.433 --> 01:46:47.402
Sometimes? How can one man
make so many mistakes?

01:46:47.903 --> 01:46:50.064
Why did you stop
our Austrian campaign?

01:46:50.272 --> 01:46:51.364
Our casualties were terrible.

01:46:51.574 --> 01:46:53.599
You knew they would be
before you started.

01:46:53.809 --> 01:46:55.504
Theirs were larger.

01:46:56.011 --> 01:46:58.104
Mother, what do you
know about strategy?

01:46:58.314 --> 01:46:59.508
What do you?

01:47:00.015 --> 01:47:01.573
What are you
doing here, anyway?

01:47:01.784 --> 01:47:03.615
There isn't a battlefield
within 500 miles.

01:47:03.819 --> 01:47:05.753
It's important that I'm here.

01:47:05.955 --> 01:47:07.422
Your place is in Petersburg.

01:47:07.623 --> 01:47:11.389
Don't you know about the riots
and scandals and starvation?

01:47:12.261 --> 01:47:15.560
They hate your wife.
They think she's a German spy.

01:47:15.764 --> 01:47:18.392
How can you let that
foolish woman ruin your country?

01:47:18.601 --> 01:47:19.761
Leave Sunny out of this.

01:47:20.803 --> 01:47:23.067
Someone has to make you
see sense about her.

01:47:23.272 --> 01:47:24.671
Can't you think of anyone else?

01:47:24.873 --> 01:47:26.807
Can't you think of
the rest of your family?

01:47:27.276 --> 01:47:28.971
Can't you think of Russia?

01:47:29.845 --> 01:47:31.142
I wish your father were alive.

01:47:31.347 --> 01:47:32.507
Don't throw him at me!

01:47:32.715 --> 01:47:33.773
He knew how to be a Tsar.

01:47:33.983 --> 01:47:36.679
He'd have burnt Vienna down,
stamped on the Germans...

01:47:36.885 --> 01:47:38.375
...and shot the strikers.

01:47:39.021 --> 01:47:41.046
Anything to give Russia peace.

01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:45.055
And he'd certainly have known
how to deal with Rasputin.

01:47:45.261 --> 01:47:46.319
He is a man of God.

01:47:47.062 --> 01:47:48.222
Do you believe that?

01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:50.898
He works miracles.
He keeps my son alive.

01:47:51.367 --> 01:47:53.062
Do you believe that, Nicky?

01:47:53.702 --> 01:47:55.499
Sunny does. She needs him.

01:47:55.738 --> 01:47:57.035
Hang him!

01:47:57.239 --> 01:47:58.900
I don't wish any man harm...

01:47:59.108 --> 01:48:01.941
...but so many Russians
will die if you don't.

01:48:02.211 --> 01:48:03.178
I can't.

01:48:03.379 --> 01:48:05.244
At least send him to Siberia.

01:48:05.447 --> 01:48:06.345
I can't!

01:48:06.548 --> 01:48:08.812
He's going to destroy us.

01:48:09.018 --> 01:48:13.648
Millions will suffer. And all because
you can't say no to your wife.

01:48:14.523 --> 01:48:15.353
It's in God's hands.

01:48:16.125 --> 01:48:17.149
That's no answer!

01:48:17.693 --> 01:48:18.887
I see what's happening!

01:48:19.094 --> 01:48:20.026
Then act!

01:48:20.296 --> 01:48:21.786
Come back home.

01:48:21.997 --> 01:48:24.625
Hang this man,
send Alexandra to Livadia...

01:48:24.833 --> 01:48:26.164
...and deal with the real problems.

01:48:26.535 --> 01:48:27.365
I can't!

01:48:28.437 --> 01:48:30.803
In Heavers name, Nicholas,
what can you do?

01:48:31.307 --> 01:48:33.502
Just what I'm doing, Mama.

01:48:34.143 --> 01:48:35.804
There's nothing else
that can be done.

01:49:19.955 --> 01:49:22.515
I hope you are not
on a diet, Father Gregory.

01:49:35.404 --> 01:49:37.463
To <i>Batushka</i> and <i>Matushka.</i>

01:49:46.682 --> 01:49:47.979
I'll die soon, my friends.

01:49:50.085 --> 01:49:51.712
I've made my will.

01:49:52.988 --> 01:49:55.183
I won't live to see the New Year.

01:49:55.391 --> 01:49:56.858
And it makes me angry.

01:49:58.494 --> 01:50:01.429
It's good to enjoy yourself
with your friends.

01:50:03.198 --> 01:50:04.859
I don't want to die.

01:50:12.241 --> 01:50:13.367
Russia!

01:50:19.915 --> 01:50:20.973
Father Gregory...

01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:22.808
...needs a woman...

01:50:23.752 --> 01:50:25.310
...to cheer him up!

01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.843
I've been poisoned.

01:52:01.083 --> 01:52:02.948
You've tried to kill me.

01:52:05.454 --> 01:52:06.921
You all have.

01:52:14.029 --> 01:52:15.428
You silly fools.

01:52:15.631 --> 01:52:17.622
I thought I could trust you.

01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:19.829
You silly little fools.

01:52:20.068 --> 01:52:22.662
You can't even kill properly.

01:52:23.505 --> 01:52:25.939
You're too small to destroy me.

01:52:29.278 --> 01:52:30.142
Look.

01:52:35.651 --> 01:52:37.084
Cyanide!

01:52:42.891 --> 01:52:44.825
Now get up, Prince!
Get up!

01:52:45.027 --> 01:52:45.925
Try!

01:52:46.161 --> 01:52:48.152
Let's see you try to kill me.

01:52:48.363 --> 01:52:49.796
Cyanide!

01:52:51.033 --> 01:52:53.160
I begged <i>Batushka</i> not
to start this war.

01:52:53.435 --> 01:52:54.663
I know who dies.

01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:56.667
You don't die.
The people die.

01:52:56.872 --> 01:52:58.635
The wise old men,
the generals, the ministers...

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:00.398
...the ones who say,
"Do this, go there!"

01:53:00.609 --> 01:53:04.045
No mud on their boots!
No bullets in their brains!

01:53:05.414 --> 01:53:07.405
Where's your rifle, Prince?

01:53:07.816 --> 01:53:09.977
Why aren't you at the front,
where the blood is?

01:53:10.185 --> 01:53:11.743
I'm not a German!

01:53:12.521 --> 01:53:14.250
I come from the Russian soil...

01:53:14.456 --> 01:53:16.447
...and you fools
will never destroy me!

01:53:17.759 --> 01:53:19.056
Thank God...

01:53:19.294 --> 01:53:21.592
...Russia has sons like me...

01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:25.163
...and isn't at the mercy
of scums like you!

01:53:46.021 --> 01:53:47.545
Let's have the other side.

01:53:52.527 --> 01:53:54.427
We must get rid of his body.

01:55:26.054 --> 01:55:28.545
God bless the Tsar.

01:55:48.043 --> 01:55:49.340
Your Majesty...

01:55:49.611 --> 01:55:52.045
...the Cabinet has been
waiting for over an hour.

01:55:52.247 --> 01:55:53.305
I can't see them today.

01:55:53.515 --> 01:55:55.949
But we need you
to sign the decrees.

01:55:56.151 --> 01:55:57.311
Petersburg is starving!

01:55:57.519 --> 01:55:58.747
I can't.

01:55:59.254 --> 01:56:01.586
You're glad he's dead!
You wanted him to die.

01:56:04.226 --> 01:56:07.821
Please tell the ministers
my mother cannot see them today.

01:56:08.363 --> 01:56:10.923
They will be informed of
a convenient time to come again.

01:56:15.103 --> 01:56:18.095
Have Grand Duke Dmitry
and Prince Yussoupov arrested.

01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:23.040
Only the Tsar can order the arrest
of one of his own family.

01:56:23.245 --> 01:56:25.679
It's his monarchical privilege.

01:56:33.688 --> 01:56:34.780
Please try.

01:56:35.690 --> 01:56:36.952
His will.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:42.293
"I feel that I shall leave life
before January the first.

01:56:45.667 --> 01:56:49.103
If any of your relatives
have wrought my death...

01:56:49.671 --> 01:56:51.696
...then no one of your family...

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:56.142
...none of your children
or relatives will remain alive.

01:56:56.545 --> 01:56:58.740
They will be killed
by the Russian people.

01:56:59.948 --> 01:57:01.609
Brother will kill brother...

01:57:03.351 --> 01:57:06.218
...and there will be
no nobles left in the country."

01:57:13.595 --> 01:57:15.722
The beast is dead!

01:57:16.298 --> 01:57:18.357
His killers are heroes!

01:57:19.467 --> 01:57:20.729
Russia is saved!

01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:23.569
Mr. President.

01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:26.034
Mr. President!

01:57:27.175 --> 01:57:28.836
Mr. President!

01:57:29.044 --> 01:57:31.171
I have the floor,
Mr. Kerensky.

01:57:31.379 --> 01:57:35.213
One madman has been murdered
and you are celebrating.

01:57:35.417 --> 01:57:37.851
There is no food, no fuel.

01:57:38.653 --> 01:57:41.417
A third of our army
is still unarmed...

01:57:41.623 --> 01:57:44.820
...and they are surrendering
in tens of thousands.

01:57:45.026 --> 01:57:47.187
Nothing is changed.

01:57:47.395 --> 01:57:50.762
The German Tsaritza is
still running the country.

01:57:50.966 --> 01:57:53.298
The Tsar must stop hiding
with his soldiers...

01:57:53.501 --> 01:57:55.492
...and come back to Petersburg!

01:57:55.804 --> 01:57:57.533
Chaos is coming to Russia...

01:57:57.739 --> 01:58:00.105
...and he should be
here to deal with it!

01:59:14.182 --> 01:59:15.376
Your Majesty?

01:59:17.819 --> 01:59:19.343
What is it, Alexeiev?

01:59:19.554 --> 01:59:22.182
There is a general strike
in St. Petersburg.

01:59:22.657 --> 01:59:24.522
The city is in chaos.

01:59:24.793 --> 01:59:26.226
It can't be.

01:59:27.062 --> 01:59:28.086
We're at war.

01:59:28.296 --> 01:59:30.764
There are demonstrations
in the streets.

01:59:31.199 --> 01:59:34.259
The Army refuses to fire on them.

01:59:38.707 --> 01:59:41.107
Telegraph this to the
Military Governor:

01:59:42.410 --> 01:59:45.277
All riots are to be
stopped at once.

01:59:46.214 --> 01:59:48.114
The <i>Duma</i> is to be dissolved.

01:59:48.917 --> 01:59:51.408
I return immediately
to Petersburg.

01:59:51.953 --> 01:59:53.887
And sign it Nicholas.

01:59:54.689 --> 01:59:58.785
Sire, I hope there is someone
in Petersburg to take our orders.

02:00:13.875 --> 02:00:16.173
Madame, his fever is still the same.

02:00:17.712 --> 02:00:19.373
If only it would break.

02:00:20.515 --> 02:00:23.075
Why did they have to
go and get measles now?

02:00:27.055 --> 02:00:28.386
Lie down, darling.

02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:29.882
I heard it again.

02:00:30.091 --> 02:00:31.991
It's nothing.
You must keep warm.

02:00:35.330 --> 02:00:37.230
When you've finished,
get some rest.

02:00:44.406 --> 02:00:45.964
Still no news from the Tsar.

02:00:46.174 --> 02:00:48.039
They don't answer our telegrams.

02:00:48.243 --> 02:00:49.801
We must reach him.

02:00:50.011 --> 02:00:51.774
He must come back.

02:00:52.747 --> 02:00:54.647
God knows what'll happen.

02:00:55.216 --> 02:00:56.444
I heard some more firing.

02:01:32.587 --> 02:01:35.351
We're cut off. Soldiers on
the track ahead, Your Majesty.

02:01:35.557 --> 02:01:36.489
They've got artillery.

02:01:36.691 --> 02:01:39.319
I must get through to Tsarkoe Selo.
My family's there.

02:01:39.527 --> 02:01:40.391
We can't.

02:01:40.595 --> 02:01:43.792
There's open track to Moscow
or to northern headquarters at Pskov.

02:01:44.065 --> 02:01:45.089
I see.

02:01:48.069 --> 02:01:49.161
Where should we go?

02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:51.235
They're rioting in Moscow.

02:01:55.110 --> 02:01:57.305
Well, then. To Pskov.

02:02:22.637 --> 02:02:24.605
Thank God you're here.
Prepare an order...

02:02:24.806 --> 02:02:27.036
Your Majesty, I'm afraid
it's too late.

02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:31.042
The <i>Duma</i> has appointed
a provisional government.

02:02:31.679 --> 02:02:34.239
And all your ministers
have been arrested.

02:02:36.885 --> 02:02:38.750
Order your troops...

02:02:39.554 --> 02:02:40.578
...to march...

02:02:40.788 --> 02:02:43.154
At this moment, Your Majesty...

02:02:43.358 --> 02:02:45.690
...if my troops knew
the Tsar was here...

02:02:45.894 --> 02:02:47.691
...there's every chance
they would turn on you.

02:02:47.896 --> 02:02:49.659
Whole garrisons are going over.

02:02:51.533 --> 02:02:54.764
Sire, the <i>Duma</i> also insists...

02:02:56.304 --> 02:02:57.498
...on your abdication.

02:03:23.331 --> 02:03:26.027
Surely my generals
stand with me?

02:03:26.234 --> 02:03:27.758
I have already...

02:03:28.236 --> 02:03:30.602
...been in touch
with the Commanders.

02:03:31.506 --> 02:03:33.030
General Kornilov:

02:03:34.242 --> 02:03:37.370
"I cannot order
an attack on Petersburg."

02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:41.211
Admiral of the Baltic Fleet...

02:03:41.482 --> 02:03:42.414
...Nepenin:

02:03:43.918 --> 02:03:45.977
"It is with greatest difficulty...

02:03:46.187 --> 02:03:48.621
...I keep my troops
and the fleet in check.

02:03:49.023 --> 02:03:51.890
I urge the Tsar to abdicate."

02:03:53.995 --> 02:03:55.087
General Ruzsky:

02:03:56.064 --> 02:03:58.328
"I cannot answer for my troops.

02:03:58.900 --> 02:04:00.561
I implore His Majesty...

02:04:00.835 --> 02:04:01.859
...to abdicate."

02:04:02.704 --> 02:04:04.535
His Imperial Highness,
General Nicolaievich...

02:04:04.739 --> 02:04:06.468
What does Nikolasha say?

02:04:07.242 --> 02:04:08.607
"On my knees...

02:04:09.444 --> 02:04:11.503
...I beg you to abdicate...

02:04:11.946 --> 02:04:13.846
...and save the dynasty."

02:05:29.691 --> 02:05:31.682
Nicky, please come home.

02:05:33.094 --> 02:05:34.721
Tell me, Dr. Federov.

02:05:34.929 --> 02:05:35.987
If my son...

02:05:36.197 --> 02:05:37.755
...as the future Tsar...

02:05:37.965 --> 02:05:40.934
...would remain behind
to be educated in Russia...

02:05:41.135 --> 02:05:43.433
...while I and my family
went abroad...

02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:48.265
...how long would he
be likely to live?

02:05:48.843 --> 02:05:50.367
Deprived of your love and care...

02:05:50.578 --> 02:05:53.877
...and what I call "customary
surroundings," it's hard to say.

02:05:54.082 --> 02:05:56.550
It's a matter of
luck and chance, Your Majesty.

02:05:56.751 --> 02:05:58.184
There are no real statistics.

02:05:58.653 --> 02:06:01.918
One would hope that he could
live a normal span of life, but...

02:06:02.123 --> 02:06:03.021
Well...

02:06:03.958 --> 02:06:04.982
...twenty...

02:06:05.259 --> 02:06:06.749
...would be a good age.

02:06:19.273 --> 02:06:22.436
"Accordingly, in agreement
with the Imperial <i>Duma...</i>

02:06:22.643 --> 02:06:25.476
...we have thought it right to
abdicate from the Russian throne...

02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:27.807
...and to lay down
the supreme power.

02:06:28.015 --> 02:06:28.845
Therefore..."

02:06:29.050 --> 02:06:30.608
It seems in order.

02:06:30.918 --> 02:06:31.850
May I?

02:06:33.488 --> 02:06:35.979
- "Therefore, in the name..."
- I won't tear it up.

02:06:38.926 --> 02:06:40.553
Shall I sign it in your lap?

02:06:50.238 --> 02:06:52.297
I wish to add one thing more.

02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:54.999
I shall abdicate for myself...

02:06:55.209 --> 02:06:56.870
...and also for my son.

02:06:58.146 --> 02:06:59.943
But, Your Majesty...

02:07:00.281 --> 02:07:01.748
...the <i>Duma</i> thought that...

02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:04.877
Everyone expected
that your son would...

02:07:05.086 --> 02:07:06.678
May I know the reasons?

02:07:07.321 --> 02:07:09.346
My reasons are personal.

02:07:10.224 --> 02:07:13.091
In that case, I shall
add the appropriate clause.

02:07:16.531 --> 02:07:18.965
It will be spring soon at Livadia.

02:07:20.835 --> 02:07:22.097
Is that where you'll send us?

02:07:23.905 --> 02:07:25.770
Yes, if you like.

02:07:26.007 --> 02:07:28.373
We've had no time
to plan ahead.

02:07:29.377 --> 02:07:32.175
I've often thought I'd
like to be a country gentleman.

02:07:32.814 --> 02:07:35.112
I've always liked
to watch things grow.

02:07:35.783 --> 02:07:37.045
It's lovely there.

02:07:38.352 --> 02:07:39.876
The sun is warm.

02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:43.350
And they say the soil
is very good.

02:07:44.392 --> 02:07:47.122
Much of the happiness
I've known I've had there.

02:07:47.495 --> 02:07:48.792
It's now in order.

02:08:06.047 --> 02:08:07.036
March...

02:08:09.116 --> 02:08:09.980
...the 15th...

02:08:10.184 --> 02:08:12.379
...1917.

02:08:15.623 --> 02:08:17.250
The Ides of March.

02:08:37.812 --> 02:08:41.043
If only you had acted sooner, sir.

02:08:42.650 --> 02:08:45.244
You think this
could have been avoided?

02:09:05.206 --> 02:09:06.070
Who is there?

02:09:06.674 --> 02:09:08.335
Nicholas Romanov.

02:09:09.043 --> 02:09:10.067
Let him pass.

02:11:14.669 --> 02:11:15.693
I'm sorry.

02:11:17.104 --> 02:11:18.298
Please...

02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:19.870
...don't...

02:11:21.075 --> 02:11:22.872
Please!

02:11:28.115 --> 02:11:29.104
Please!

02:11:29.717 --> 02:11:31.981
I didn't mean to.

02:11:33.154 --> 02:11:34.212
Please!

02:11:35.890 --> 02:11:37.517
I'm so ashamed.

02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:41.821
I didn't mean to do it.

02:11:42.697 --> 02:11:44.324
Please don't!

02:11:45.066 --> 02:11:47.466
Please don't!

02:11:47.802 --> 02:11:49.326
Please!

02:12:08.489 --> 02:12:10.787
Graduated at Kazan University...

02:12:10.991 --> 02:12:12.686
...with a degree in law.

02:12:14.061 --> 02:12:14.891
Brother...

02:12:15.496 --> 02:12:18.795
...hanged for terrorism
in 1887...

02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:21.900
...by the present Tsar's father.

02:12:23.370 --> 02:12:24.302
Married.

02:12:25.706 --> 02:12:26.832
No children.

02:12:27.708 --> 02:12:28.970
Doesn't smoke.

02:12:30.911 --> 02:12:33.072
And won't let his comrades...

02:12:33.581 --> 02:12:34.570
...smoke.

02:12:37.318 --> 02:12:39.183
Grandson of a serf.

02:12:40.621 --> 02:12:42.179
Well-traveled, I see.

02:12:42.389 --> 02:12:44.914
The Tsar should have had
your secret police.

02:12:45.159 --> 02:12:47.627
My party will make
a study of your methods.

02:12:48.295 --> 02:12:50.661
They fail to mention
your sense of humor.

02:12:50.865 --> 02:12:52.332
It gets even funnier.

02:12:52.533 --> 02:12:55.866
I want to get to Petersburg.
You want to get to Paris.

02:12:56.070 --> 02:12:57.731
It's outrageous.

02:12:57.938 --> 02:13:00.168
We are here in Zurich,
and if I understand you...

02:13:00.374 --> 02:13:03.741
...you want the German government,
which is at war with Russia...

02:13:03.944 --> 02:13:06.344
...to take you across
Germany to Sweden...

02:13:06.547 --> 02:13:08.538
...because you can get
to Russia from there.

02:13:08.916 --> 02:13:10.645
I'm offering to stop the war.

02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:14.850
I didn't know you had
so much authority.

02:13:15.756 --> 02:13:17.621
If we had a Bolshevik government...

02:13:17.825 --> 02:13:19.952
...we'd immediately
make peace with Germany.

02:13:20.161 --> 02:13:23.187
Then how many German divisions could
you transfer to the western front?

02:13:23.664 --> 02:13:27.395
And now you are asking me
for classified information.

02:13:27.701 --> 02:13:31.728
Do you know my government locked up
more Bolsheviks than anyone else?

02:13:32.039 --> 02:13:33.802
How can you expect us...

02:13:34.008 --> 02:13:35.873
...to help you make a revolution?

02:13:36.076 --> 02:13:37.668
You have no sense of proportion.

02:13:37.878 --> 02:13:40.438
All I'm interested in
is power in Russia.

02:13:40.648 --> 02:13:43.208
It's lying on the streets
waiting to be picked up.

02:13:43.651 --> 02:13:45.915
Kerensky won't last.
He's still fighting the war...

02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:48.680
...and the people are
desperate for peace.

02:13:48.923 --> 02:13:50.584
I shall offer them peace.

02:13:51.325 --> 02:13:53.953
Then you'll see
the real revolution.

02:13:54.295 --> 02:13:57.196
I see your jokes
are very subtle.

02:13:57.398 --> 02:14:00.424
A Marxist wants to use the Kaiser.

02:14:01.702 --> 02:14:04.227
And perhaps the Kaiser...

02:14:04.438 --> 02:14:06.599
...can use a Marxist.

02:14:22.656 --> 02:14:23.623
There.

02:14:25.259 --> 02:14:27.352
In a few months,
these will be turnips.

02:14:27.962 --> 02:14:29.293
They're carrots.

02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:31.395
And when they grow...

02:14:31.599 --> 02:14:33.760
...will we still be here to eat them?

02:14:35.135 --> 02:14:36.693
Nicholas Romanov!

02:15:08.736 --> 02:15:10.533
My name is Kerensky.

02:15:11.739 --> 02:15:14.833
I always used to offer
sherry in this room.

02:15:15.609 --> 02:15:16.974
There's none left.

02:15:17.177 --> 02:15:19.475
I haven't much time.
We must talk.

02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:21.511
What's happening to the war?

02:15:21.715 --> 02:15:23.910
We hear the soldiers talking.
One hears of...

02:15:24.118 --> 02:15:25.745
...terrible defeats.

02:15:25.953 --> 02:15:27.318
Will we fight on?

02:15:27.521 --> 02:15:28.681
Certainly.

02:15:28.889 --> 02:15:31.221
The future of my government
depends on it.

02:15:31.425 --> 02:15:33.791
We stand pledged to victory.

02:15:33.994 --> 02:15:37.760
What all of us have been through
has some meaning after all.

02:15:39.333 --> 02:15:41.358
Will we be staying
here much longer?

02:15:41.568 --> 02:15:43.900
You will be leaving here
in a few days.

02:15:45.406 --> 02:15:47.499
All we do is dream of England.

02:15:47.975 --> 02:15:49.909
We've been very happy there.

02:15:50.611 --> 02:15:52.806
- May I sit down?
- I'm sorry.

02:15:55.182 --> 02:15:56.740
England won't accept you.

02:15:59.386 --> 02:16:00.717
Won't accept?

02:16:01.989 --> 02:16:03.354
King George is my cousin.

02:16:03.557 --> 02:16:05.548
He doesn't seem to want you, either.

02:16:05.926 --> 02:16:08.087
He has to think of his own position.

02:16:08.395 --> 02:16:09.726
Of course.

02:16:10.631 --> 02:16:13.293
I must not make difficulties for...

02:16:13.901 --> 02:16:15.562
Nor will the French.

02:16:15.903 --> 02:16:18.337
None of our allies want to risk it.

02:16:18.973 --> 02:16:20.804
They are at war to save democracy...

02:16:21.008 --> 02:16:22.202
...and you were a tyrant.

02:16:22.676 --> 02:16:23.904
I'm a prisoner.

02:16:24.912 --> 02:16:26.846
Damn them, I'm a father
with a family!

02:16:27.047 --> 02:16:28.241
You will be safe.

02:16:28.449 --> 02:16:30.041
I'll see to that.

02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:33.844
There's blood enough on everybody's
hands. I won't have yours on mine.

02:16:34.355 --> 02:16:35.652
Just as soon as possible...

02:16:35.856 --> 02:16:37.323
...you'll be leaving for Siberia...

02:16:37.523 --> 02:16:38.888
...to a village near Tobolsk.

02:16:39.093 --> 02:16:40.082
Siberia?

02:16:40.494 --> 02:16:42.189
You will be staying there
for a week or so...

02:16:42.396 --> 02:16:45.388
...until I can organize some way
for you to leave the country.

02:16:45.599 --> 02:16:46.861
From there on...

02:16:47.066 --> 02:16:48.932
...I wash my hands of you.

02:16:51.638 --> 02:16:53.434
Why not send us out to Finland?

02:16:53.639 --> 02:16:55.198
It's just 30 miles away.

02:16:55.409 --> 02:16:57.707
I'd never get you through
St. Petersburg alive.

02:16:58.312 --> 02:17:01.371
Do you realize I'm all that stands
between you and the block?

02:17:02.483 --> 02:17:03.380
No munitions.

02:17:04.218 --> 02:17:05.684
No supplies.

02:17:06.486 --> 02:17:08.955
I don't know where the Army stands.

02:17:10.023 --> 02:17:11.718
Treasury is bankrupt.

02:17:11.959 --> 02:17:13.755
The students riot.

02:17:14.361 --> 02:17:16.261
Workers carry arms.

02:17:16.463 --> 02:17:18.931
The Socialists want this.
The Menshiviks want that.

02:17:19.133 --> 02:17:22.192
The radicals, the centrists,
the cadets.

02:17:22.636 --> 02:17:24.035
The Bolsheviks.

02:17:25.072 --> 02:17:27.665
I can't arrest them
even if I wanted to.

02:17:27.975 --> 02:17:30.272
We have rights and laws now.

02:17:30.811 --> 02:17:33.177
You had power and no laws.

02:17:33.379 --> 02:17:35.405
I have laws and no power.

02:17:36.916 --> 02:17:38.248
I wish I could help you.

02:17:38.986 --> 02:17:40.816
You had your chances.

02:17:41.655 --> 02:17:42.916
I wish I had mine.

02:18:45.052 --> 02:18:46.485
Revolution!

02:18:49.522 --> 02:18:51.787
Revolution, now!

02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:55.019
Land!

02:18:55.829 --> 02:18:56.817
Peace!

02:18:58.465 --> 02:18:59.762
All power...

02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:01.761
...to the Soviets!

02:19:08.308 --> 02:19:12.244
Not quite like your Parliament.
We haven't English manners yet.

02:19:12.513 --> 02:19:16.040
My government is more concerned
with content than style.

02:19:16.415 --> 02:19:19.316
One detects a sentiment for peace.
That worries us.

02:19:19.686 --> 02:19:20.983
It's mostly the Bolsheviks.

02:19:21.188 --> 02:19:23.019
Nobody pays any attention to them.

02:19:23.223 --> 02:19:25.088
They only have 6 members
in the <i>Duma.</i>

02:19:25.392 --> 02:19:28.361
In your position, I'd put
this Lenin quietly in jail.

02:19:28.562 --> 02:19:29.494
On what pretext?

02:19:29.696 --> 02:19:31.823
I've read his speeches.
Surely you have too.

02:19:32.065 --> 02:19:35.262
I cannot put a man in jail
for what he thinks.

02:19:35.468 --> 02:19:36.594
It's in your Bill of Rights.

02:19:36.803 --> 02:19:38.794
He wants to overthrow
the government by force.

02:19:39.005 --> 02:19:40.598
We Americans call that treason.

02:19:40.807 --> 02:19:42.240
In Russia, it's always been...

02:19:42.643 --> 02:19:45.806
...too easy to lock a man up
because he disagrees with you.

02:19:46.112 --> 02:19:47.602
It's a bad habit.

02:19:47.915 --> 02:19:48.939
If the people want Lenin...

02:19:49.316 --> 02:19:51.546
...they can vote him into power
in December.

02:19:51.752 --> 02:19:53.185
Until that time...

02:19:53.820 --> 02:19:56.311
Rodzianko has finished.
I must speak now.

02:19:56.523 --> 02:19:59.424
I trust I've made my government's
position clear.

02:19:59.626 --> 02:20:02.322
America wants Russia in the war.

02:20:02.529 --> 02:20:04.019
The British government is equally...

02:20:04.364 --> 02:20:06.025
...worried about the
peace demonstrations.

02:20:06.233 --> 02:20:07.598
No more than France.

02:20:07.801 --> 02:20:10.668
Russia's contribution is vital
to the Allied cause.

02:20:10.871 --> 02:20:12.236
Let me be blunt, Mr. Kerensky.

02:20:12.606 --> 02:20:16.167
We're offering you 300
million dollars if you fight.

02:20:16.610 --> 02:20:17.907
No war, no loan.

02:20:18.445 --> 02:20:20.640
You cannot buy Russia.

02:20:21.548 --> 02:20:22.845
We will fight...

02:20:23.050 --> 02:20:25.712
...because we've already
sacrificed too much.

02:20:26.086 --> 02:20:28.577
We owe it to the dead!

02:20:28.789 --> 02:20:31.257
They must count for something!

02:20:31.625 --> 02:20:32.922
Victory!

02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:35.455
Nothing less than victory!

02:20:53.013 --> 02:20:54.037
Look! Look!

02:20:54.615 --> 02:20:56.378
I've found Tobolsk on the map.

02:20:56.583 --> 02:20:58.016
It's further away than London.

02:20:58.385 --> 02:20:59.943
Yes, <i>ma chère.</i>

02:21:01.054 --> 02:21:03.852
Now remember, you are princesses.

02:21:04.224 --> 02:21:06.715
If I hear of any misbehavior...

02:21:07.427 --> 02:21:09.759
...I shall be very angry.

02:21:10.297 --> 02:21:11.491
We'll be good.

02:21:14.201 --> 02:21:16.499
You're all so big now.

02:21:19.539 --> 02:21:21.439
Help Mama and Papa.

02:21:22.142 --> 02:21:23.632
Yes, we will.

02:21:28.949 --> 02:21:30.507
Goodbye, Alexis.

02:21:35.656 --> 02:21:37.180
I'm glad we're going.

02:21:37.624 --> 02:21:38.784
I hate this place.

02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:45.425
Let me come with you.

02:21:47.801 --> 02:21:49.928
You're too old for Siberia.

02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:51.532
You'll be all right.

02:21:51.738 --> 02:21:53.365
But who will look after you?

02:21:53.573 --> 02:21:56.565
You've never been
anywhere without me.

02:22:05.485 --> 02:22:07.043
Take care of yourself.

02:22:11.358 --> 02:22:12.825
The train is ready.

02:22:13.026 --> 02:22:14.550
This is Colonel Kobylinsky.

02:22:14.761 --> 02:22:17.696
You will be under his command
until you leave the country.

02:22:17.898 --> 02:22:20.389
His orders carry my authority
at all times.

02:22:20.634 --> 02:22:22.898
Nicholas, I want my things.

02:22:24.471 --> 02:22:26.496
I want my pictures and scrapbooks.
I want...

02:22:26.707 --> 02:22:28.106
<i>Frau</i> Romanov.

02:22:28.475 --> 02:22:30.136
You have kept your head.

02:22:30.344 --> 02:22:31.868
You should be grateful.

02:22:35.515 --> 02:22:37.506
Come along. It doesn't matter.

02:22:37.984 --> 02:22:41.511
No, Vladimir. One goodbye
was enough, please.

02:22:44.424 --> 02:22:45.652
Things.

02:22:46.393 --> 02:22:48.156
Things one can do without.

02:22:48.362 --> 02:22:50.523
They break, get lost.

02:22:51.365 --> 02:22:52.992
One buys and sells them.

02:22:54.167 --> 02:22:56.658
The main thing is we are together.

02:23:55.796 --> 02:23:57.195
Power stations.

02:23:57.697 --> 02:23:59.289
All railway stations.

02:23:59.699 --> 02:24:00.961
State bank.

02:24:01.701 --> 02:24:02.998
Central telephone exchange.

02:24:16.483 --> 02:24:19.611
The Bolsheviks have taken over
the station...

02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:21.219
...the telegraphs...

02:24:21.655 --> 02:24:22.917
...the banks.

02:24:24.357 --> 02:24:26.552
How strong are they?

02:24:27.093 --> 02:24:29.288
If we had loyal troops...

02:24:29.496 --> 02:24:31.691
...how many would it take
to dislodge them?

02:24:31.898 --> 02:24:34.162
One regiment would be enough.

02:24:35.669 --> 02:24:37.466
But I haven't got a regiment.

02:24:38.004 --> 02:24:39.028
Not one I can trust.

02:24:40.774 --> 02:24:44.210
Yes, but there's only
a handful of them, surely!

02:24:44.678 --> 02:24:47.772
We could smash them
if we acted now!

02:24:48.482 --> 02:24:51.246
We told the people
to go on with the war.

02:24:51.451 --> 02:24:53.214
Lenin offered peace.

02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:55.681
That's where we went wrong.

02:24:56.490 --> 02:24:57.821
Look at this.

02:25:02.329 --> 02:25:03.921
The cruiser <i>Aurora.</i>

02:25:05.065 --> 02:25:07.465
And every gun is trained on us.

02:25:13.874 --> 02:25:15.535
The government has fallen.

02:25:30.090 --> 02:25:32.558
We shall now begin to construct...

02:25:32.759 --> 02:25:34.021
...the Socialist order.

02:26:08.261 --> 02:26:09.558
What's it say?

02:26:10.330 --> 02:26:11.854
It's twenty-one below.

02:26:12.499 --> 02:26:13.830
It feels like it.

02:26:15.068 --> 02:26:17.229
How can you go out
in this weather?

02:26:17.437 --> 02:26:18.836
Gilliard's waiting.

02:26:19.072 --> 02:26:21.540
And besides, I quite enjoy it.

02:26:31.217 --> 02:26:33.651
That's the second time
this morning.

02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:37.146
There's so little else to do.
I keep forgetting.

02:26:37.490 --> 02:26:39.185
Aren’t you bored, Madame?

02:26:41.027 --> 02:26:42.927
At times, I actually like it.

02:26:43.129 --> 02:26:46.724
Mending clothes and teaching class
and quiet afternoons.

02:26:47.167 --> 02:26:50.466
I doze and daydream
and I think about my life.

02:26:52.806 --> 02:26:54.865
I don't know what I did wrong.

02:26:56.543 --> 02:26:58.340
I'd feel better if I did.

02:27:00.714 --> 02:27:02.477
Here, take it if it helps.

02:27:22.002 --> 02:27:23.333
Christ!

02:27:24.771 --> 02:27:26.329
I can't trust my own men.

02:27:26.539 --> 02:27:28.302
Anything could set them off.

02:27:28.808 --> 02:27:31.971
I don't give orders anymore.
I make suggestions.

02:27:32.212 --> 02:27:33.839
They go and vote.

02:27:34.848 --> 02:27:37.339
Tomorrow they could vote to hang me.

02:27:37.751 --> 02:27:39.116
It's absurd.

02:27:40.053 --> 02:27:41.020
They're decent boys.

02:27:41.221 --> 02:27:43.121
They were once, but they're
lonely now.

02:27:43.323 --> 02:27:45.757
Cold and scared to death.

02:27:47.927 --> 02:27:49.360
Have you got any money?

02:27:49.696 --> 02:27:50.754
Not much.

02:27:51.164 --> 02:27:52.062
Why?

02:27:52.432 --> 02:27:55.333
Has it crossed your mind I represent
a nonexistent government?

02:27:55.535 --> 02:27:57.503
Who put me in this post,
gave me authority?

02:27:57.704 --> 02:28:00.468
Whose money pays the troops?
Kerensky's gone.

02:28:00.707 --> 02:28:02.902
The money's gone.
I haven't paid them in a month.

02:28:03.109 --> 02:28:04.940
You think I should pay them?

02:28:05.512 --> 02:28:07.571
The prisoners keep the guard.

02:28:07.947 --> 02:28:10.211
I wish I'd had you
for my finance minister.

02:28:10.417 --> 02:28:12.009
You'd have revolutionized
the penal system.

02:28:12.218 --> 02:28:13.276
Don't laugh.

02:28:13.486 --> 02:28:15.147
Shall I take the collection?

02:28:15.588 --> 02:28:18.056
In Tobolsk, there
are rumors of civil war.

02:28:18.258 --> 02:28:20.453
God only knows what's going on!

02:28:21.294 --> 02:28:23.990
Out here, exposed like this.

02:28:26.433 --> 02:28:28.731
That's not to keep you in here.

02:28:29.069 --> 02:28:31.196
It's to keep them out.

02:28:31.638 --> 02:28:32.468
Them?

02:28:33.306 --> 02:28:35.831
- Who are you expecting?
- I don't know.

02:28:37.043 --> 02:28:39.341
I hate this damned assignment!

02:28:41.481 --> 02:28:43.506
I can't answer for your safety.

02:28:44.117 --> 02:28:45.948
I can't do my job.

02:28:47.887 --> 02:28:50.287
You care what happens to us,
don't you?

02:28:51.791 --> 02:28:53.349
It's my job to.

02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:58.788
What was that about?

02:29:00.066 --> 02:29:02.125
Apparently there's a civil war.

02:29:04.170 --> 02:29:05.762
I'm not surprised.

02:29:06.573 --> 02:29:09.201
Too many people had too much to lose.

02:29:09.609 --> 02:29:10.735
He's worried.

02:29:11.678 --> 02:29:12.872
We all are.

02:30:04.197 --> 02:30:05.528
Put it down, Vollinski.

02:30:05.865 --> 02:30:06.854
Go to hell!

02:30:08.368 --> 02:30:09.232
I'll shoot.

02:30:16.376 --> 02:30:18.776
Monsieur Gilliard wants you
for your history lesson.

02:30:18.978 --> 02:30:20.673
Don't keep him waiting.

02:30:24.651 --> 02:30:26.175
You too, young man.

02:30:26.653 --> 02:30:28.484
I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:30:31.991 --> 02:30:33.458
- You're cut.
- Hands off!

02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:34.854
You'd better see the doctor.

02:30:35.061 --> 02:30:36.585
I said, hands off!

02:30:36.796 --> 02:30:39.026
Dr. Botkin hasn't had a thing
to do for weeks.

02:30:39.232 --> 02:30:41.029
It's making him difficult
to live with.

02:30:41.234 --> 02:30:42.929
You'd be doing us all a favor.

02:30:44.103 --> 02:30:45.092
You dizzy?

02:30:45.305 --> 02:30:46.897
I'm all right.

02:30:47.106 --> 02:30:48.471
Come on, then.

02:30:48.675 --> 02:30:50.165
My wife's a nurse.

02:30:50.777 --> 02:30:52.642
They'll fix you up between them.

02:31:25.311 --> 02:31:26.903
So that's how it's done.

02:31:27.113 --> 02:31:29.138
I've never celebrated Easter
with real eggs.

02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:32.147
When they dry, rub them with bacon fat
to make them shine.

02:31:32.352 --> 02:31:34.786
- I want to do the next one.
- I used to dread Easter.

02:31:34.988 --> 02:31:38.947
I had to kiss the whole court
three times. Sixteen hundred people!

02:31:39.192 --> 02:31:42.559
They used to line up to be kissed.
It puts you off kissing.

02:31:44.998 --> 02:31:46.329
Christ has risen.

02:31:46.532 --> 02:31:47.692
Christ has risen.

02:31:52.906 --> 02:31:54.237
They've started to dance.

02:31:54.440 --> 02:31:56.101
Can we see? Please!

02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:57.503
- Come on.
- Let's!

02:31:58.711 --> 02:32:00.144
Open the door.

02:32:06.352 --> 02:32:08.149
They look so happy.

02:32:08.421 --> 02:32:10.116
Let's go out to them.

02:32:10.390 --> 02:32:11.652
I don't think we should.

02:32:11.858 --> 02:32:13.052
Mother, please! Let's!

02:32:57.603 --> 02:32:59.298
Go and join your sisters.

02:33:00.573 --> 02:33:01.505
No.

02:33:26.499 --> 02:33:29.866
- And authorizing transfer
of command to me.

02:33:30.370 --> 02:33:32.736
By order of the Central
Committee in Moscow.

02:33:33.339 --> 02:33:35.034
It seems in order, Commissar.

02:33:36.009 --> 02:33:38.443
Are you at liberty to say
what Moscow wants them for?

02:33:38.644 --> 02:33:40.271
No, Colonel, I can't tell you.

02:33:40.646 --> 02:33:42.011
I don't know.

02:33:42.982 --> 02:33:45.280
How soon can transport
for the prisoners be organized?

02:33:45.485 --> 02:33:47.578
- What kind of transport?
- Anything that moves.

02:33:47.787 --> 02:33:50.347
- Tomorrow sometime.
- Good. We leave tomorrow night.

02:33:50.556 --> 02:33:51.818
May I know why?

02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:55.489
The civil war.

02:33:55.962 --> 02:33:57.827
The Whites, they call themselves.

02:33:58.031 --> 02:34:00.761
Conservatives and Monarchists
and Tsarist generals.

02:34:00.967 --> 02:34:02.229
All our enemies.

02:34:02.602 --> 02:34:04.502
They're moving towards Siberia.

02:34:05.104 --> 02:34:06.469
They're powerful.

02:34:06.672 --> 02:34:08.572
Our troops have yielded
half the Ukraine.

02:34:08.775 --> 02:34:11.073
On all fronts, the revolution
is in danger.

02:34:11.277 --> 02:34:12.801
And out here...

02:34:13.112 --> 02:34:15.012
...it's open season
on your Romanovs.

02:34:15.982 --> 02:34:17.279
I'll see them now.

02:34:19.719 --> 02:34:21.687
Can't your government
protect us here?

02:34:21.888 --> 02:34:23.412
We're so out of touch.

02:34:23.623 --> 02:34:25.557
Has your government lost it...?

02:34:36.202 --> 02:34:37.829
Has your government lost
its authority too?

02:34:38.037 --> 02:34:41.268
My government is 3000 miles away.

02:34:41.974 --> 02:34:44.408
Out here, they listen when they like.
When they don't...

02:34:44.610 --> 02:34:45.872
...the lines go dead.

02:34:47.046 --> 02:34:49.981
The Ural Soviet has ordered
your arrest.

02:34:50.183 --> 02:34:53.744
They have a prison, just for you,
in Ekaterinburg.

02:34:53.953 --> 02:34:55.853
You're less than
popular out here.

02:34:56.322 --> 02:34:59.120
Am I beloved in Moscow?

02:34:59.692 --> 02:35:02.684
Do they want me for a
public trial? Is that it?

02:35:03.362 --> 02:35:05.956
And when they find me
guilty, what then?

02:35:06.432 --> 02:35:09.458
They can roast you on a spit
for all I care.

02:35:10.303 --> 02:35:13.136
My duty is to
get you there intact.

02:35:13.806 --> 02:35:15.899
From now on, strict security
will be observed.

02:35:16.109 --> 02:35:18.077
You're confined to this house
until we leave.

02:35:18.311 --> 02:35:19.869
I'll have him first.

02:35:42.535 --> 02:35:43.729
I'm sorry.

02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:46.900
He's an educated man,
at any rate.

02:35:47.406 --> 02:35:49.567
They could have sent an executioner.

02:35:49.909 --> 02:35:50.807
Father?

02:35:51.711 --> 02:35:53.338
There's no hope, is there?

02:35:56.516 --> 02:35:57.380
Nonsense.

02:35:58.217 --> 02:35:59.616
None at all.

02:36:04.457 --> 02:36:05.287
Sit.

02:36:05.925 --> 02:36:07.483
May I ask why?

02:36:08.728 --> 02:36:10.491
Surely my features are familiar?

02:36:10.730 --> 02:36:12.630
Front face and profile.

02:36:13.533 --> 02:36:14.761
Sit down!

02:36:24.143 --> 02:36:25.610
Look at me! It's just awful.

02:36:25.811 --> 02:36:26.937
You look like a thief.

02:36:27.146 --> 02:36:28.443
You look like a trollop.

02:36:28.648 --> 02:36:30.912
I don't. What's a trollop?

02:36:31.617 --> 02:36:33.482
Dear Lord, so she does!

02:36:33.953 --> 02:36:35.784
- I don't find that amusing.
- Just look.

02:36:35.988 --> 02:36:37.683
It's not amusing at all.

02:37:35.581 --> 02:37:37.344
The girls won't stop crying.

02:37:37.550 --> 02:37:38.642
How is he?

02:37:39.852 --> 02:37:41.080
I don't know.

02:37:41.721 --> 02:37:43.086
It's not as bad as some.

02:37:43.289 --> 02:37:45.553
The knee will go on swelling
for a bit.

02:37:45.758 --> 02:37:48.352
It may be weeks before
he walks again.

02:37:48.861 --> 02:37:50.089
But he'll mend.

02:37:50.997 --> 02:37:52.089
Mend!

02:37:57.837 --> 02:37:59.304
I'm all right, Father.

02:38:00.006 --> 02:38:03.237
- Botkin tells me you'll be fine.
- I tripped.

02:38:03.542 --> 02:38:05.442
I don't believe you.

02:38:06.212 --> 02:38:09.181
I ought to sleep.
They told me to get some rest.

02:38:09.382 --> 02:38:12.442
We are going God knows why
to God knows where...

02:38:12.652 --> 02:38:14.119
...and you do this!

02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:16.413
I have a family to protect.

02:38:18.491 --> 02:38:20.220
What are you doing for them?

02:38:20.459 --> 02:38:22.188
What did you ever do?

02:38:22.862 --> 02:38:25.831
You abdicated, you gave in!
I thought Tsars had to die!

02:38:26.065 --> 02:38:26.963
I did it for you.

02:38:27.166 --> 02:38:28.963
- You could have fought.
- For you?

02:38:29.268 --> 02:38:30.462
I'm so ashamed of you.

02:38:31.304 --> 02:38:34.239
Look at us!
Look where you've put us.

02:38:36.642 --> 02:38:37.973
Thinking back...

02:38:40.446 --> 02:38:43.609
When I think back, I can see
them so clearly now...

02:38:44.283 --> 02:38:46.410
...corners that I didn't turn.

02:38:48.521 --> 02:38:50.284
You've had no life.

02:38:51.557 --> 02:38:53.821
The girls have had no life.

02:38:54.860 --> 02:38:56.418
I wasted you.

02:38:57.263 --> 02:39:00.096
I had your future in my hands
and spent it.

02:39:01.567 --> 02:39:03.034
Look at you.

02:39:03.903 --> 02:39:05.768
You're all I see.

02:39:05.971 --> 02:39:07.268
Your faces.

02:39:08.074 --> 02:39:10.634
Why did you abdicate for me?

02:39:10.843 --> 02:39:13.641
Why?
You didn't even ask.

02:39:14.046 --> 02:39:15.673
I didn't want you to pay
for my mistakes.

02:39:16.248 --> 02:39:18.216
Am I not paying for them now?

02:39:18.417 --> 02:39:19.884
Aren’t all of us?

02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:23.218
I should have had a chance...

02:39:23.422 --> 02:39:27.415
...the right to live my own life,
make my own decisions.

02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:29.894
I could have tried to help Russia...

02:39:30.596 --> 02:39:33.929
...help Mother and my sisters,
and perhaps, even you.

02:39:34.734 --> 02:39:37.066
I could have been a Romanov...

02:39:37.269 --> 02:39:38.395
...a Tsar.

02:39:39.772 --> 02:39:41.831
It all went wrong.

02:39:43.008 --> 02:39:45.238
I hardly know why or how.

02:39:46.846 --> 02:39:49.007
Instead, I just bleed.

02:39:49.548 --> 02:39:51.038
It's my fate.

02:39:51.250 --> 02:39:52.376
I bleed.

02:39:54.420 --> 02:39:55.887
I love you.

02:39:57.456 --> 02:39:59.321
Please understand.

02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:02.855
I do, Father.

02:40:04.797 --> 02:40:06.731
But does it really matter?

02:40:13.105 --> 02:40:14.129
Goodbye.

02:40:15.408 --> 02:40:16.898
What will you do now?

02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:18.738
What can I do?

02:40:18.944 --> 02:40:21.378
Whatever side I join,
I kill Russians.

02:40:22.047 --> 02:40:23.674
I don't know what
to do anymore.

02:40:23.883 --> 02:40:25.009
We're ready.

02:40:29.121 --> 02:40:31.089
What a world this is.

02:40:32.458 --> 02:40:33.288
God bless you.

02:40:34.460 --> 02:40:36.018
It's too late for that.

02:40:37.897 --> 02:40:38.864
But thank you.

02:40:54.747 --> 02:40:56.772
Are you all right?
Does it hurt?

02:40:56.982 --> 02:40:57.880
Would you like it to?

02:40:58.083 --> 02:40:59.072
Not at all.

02:40:59.285 --> 02:41:01.276
Why are you moving a sick boy?
It's inhuman.

02:41:01.487 --> 02:41:03.580
I am just taking you to Moscow,
that's all.

02:41:03.789 --> 02:41:05.154
And what happens to us there?

02:41:05.357 --> 02:41:06.187
Get in.

02:41:06.392 --> 02:41:09.293
And pray that when we get out of here,
there'll be a train.

02:42:12.625 --> 02:42:14.320
How long till Moscow?

02:42:14.627 --> 02:42:16.094
Five or six days.

02:42:18.297 --> 02:42:19.662
What are our chances?

02:42:19.865 --> 02:42:20.695
Of what?

02:42:21.233 --> 02:42:22.825
Living till Christmas?

02:42:23.035 --> 02:42:24.798
I haven't thought about it.

02:42:25.971 --> 02:42:27.404
You puzzle me.

02:42:28.073 --> 02:42:31.008
You'd be happy to see us dead,
and yet you help us get away.

02:42:31.210 --> 02:42:33.644
I haven't your taste for murder,
Bloody Nicholas.

02:42:33.846 --> 02:42:35.871
I've never had a chance
to get used to it.

02:42:36.482 --> 02:42:39.940
How many men have you killed?
Have you the least idea?

02:42:40.853 --> 02:42:43.287
God knows how many peasants died!

02:42:43.989 --> 02:42:46.014
Nobody counted children.

02:42:46.592 --> 02:42:50.551
You only know the number of soldiers
because somebody counted them for you.

02:42:50.829 --> 02:42:52.660
Seven million!

02:42:54.366 --> 02:42:57.301
Six quarts a man
times seven million.

02:42:58.203 --> 02:42:59.670
It's an ocean.

02:43:02.274 --> 02:43:04.242
You ever seen a battle?

02:43:07.046 --> 02:43:09.571
I'm wrong. You're not
Bloody Nicholas.

02:43:10.783 --> 02:43:13.377
You're a man of no imagination.

02:43:26.832 --> 02:43:28.424
Fit for a king.

02:43:47.052 --> 02:43:49.077
Comrade Commissar!

02:43:49.722 --> 02:43:51.815
Comrade Commissar!

02:44:07.239 --> 02:44:10.936
Greetings from the Ural Soviet
at Ekaterinburg, comrade.

02:44:11.143 --> 02:44:14.601
I have an order authorizing me
to take charge of your prisoners.

02:44:16.281 --> 02:44:17.248
From the Ural Soviet.

02:44:17.783 --> 02:44:20.183
My orders come from
the Central Committee in Moscow.

02:44:20.386 --> 02:44:22.445
I'm not in your jurisdiction.
Move your train.

02:44:22.821 --> 02:44:25.585
I want the Romanovs.
I have a legal order for them.

02:44:25.791 --> 02:44:28.919
There's only one legal government
in Soviet Russia.

02:44:29.128 --> 02:44:31.187
One government? Where is it?

02:44:31.964 --> 02:44:33.431
What's it doing?

02:44:33.866 --> 02:44:35.731
They're losing to the Whites!

02:44:36.068 --> 02:44:37.695
They've taken Omsk.

02:44:37.903 --> 02:44:40.098
And they're coming here
to save your Tsar!

02:44:40.305 --> 02:44:42.102
Can your Central Committee
stop them?

02:44:42.307 --> 02:44:44.707
He's not my Tsar.
He's my responsibility.

02:44:45.010 --> 02:44:47.535
I'm not saving him,
I'm taking him to trial.

02:44:47.746 --> 02:44:50.476
We must stay inside the law!
We're not the Okrana.

02:44:50.683 --> 02:44:53.174
That's why we had
a revolution, comrade.

02:44:54.753 --> 02:44:55.947
We're going through.

02:44:56.522 --> 02:44:57.352
Try.

02:44:59.391 --> 02:45:01.018
I'll shoot you.

02:45:02.795 --> 02:45:04.854
And I'll get a medal for it.

02:45:14.406 --> 02:45:16.306
Mine or Moscow's, Commissar?

02:45:17.376 --> 02:45:19.674
Whose legal orders do you take?

02:46:36.889 --> 02:46:37.947
Get away!

02:46:47.266 --> 02:46:48.198
Get in!

02:46:53.872 --> 02:46:54.998
What are you doing?

02:46:55.207 --> 02:46:57.402
Only Russians in the truck.
You're Swiss neutrals.

02:46:57.609 --> 02:46:59.668
- They're with us.
- I've got my orders.

02:46:59.878 --> 02:47:00.970
Get in!

02:47:01.100 --> 02:47:03.078
<i>Monsieur</i> Gilliard!

02:47:03.282 --> 02:47:04.408
I'll write!

02:47:04.783 --> 02:47:07.047
I'll try to see you!

02:47:10.522 --> 02:47:11.454
Come on.

02:47:12.324 --> 02:47:13.689
Get out! Come on!

02:47:15.494 --> 02:47:17.052
Hurry up! Come on!

02:47:31.610 --> 02:47:33.202
You must be very tired.

02:47:33.478 --> 02:47:34.911
Come inside...

02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:36.947
...and get dry.

02:48:23.028 --> 02:48:24.655
Is today your birthday?

02:48:26.131 --> 02:48:27.792
That was weeks ago.

02:48:28.467 --> 02:48:29.934
Of course it was.

02:48:30.402 --> 02:48:31.869
And mine too.

02:48:32.471 --> 02:48:33.563
I was 46.

02:48:34.106 --> 02:48:35.334
Imagine that.

02:48:35.908 --> 02:48:36.875
Breakfast?

02:48:37.676 --> 02:48:40.042
I'm not hungry. You eat it.

02:48:40.646 --> 02:48:41.670
Nor am I.

02:48:43.282 --> 02:48:44.715
What's the day like?

02:48:45.017 --> 02:48:46.484
I don't know now.

02:48:48.153 --> 02:48:49.677
It doesn't matter.

02:48:50.923 --> 02:48:52.481
It goes on and on.

02:48:54.526 --> 02:48:56.153
I don't know anymore.

02:48:57.763 --> 02:49:00.027
What can God have in mind for us?

02:49:02.134 --> 02:49:03.396
They've left a crack!

02:49:03.602 --> 02:49:04.626
What difference does it make?

02:49:04.836 --> 02:49:07.805
- Look. Something might happen.
- What?

02:49:08.006 --> 02:49:09.598
Something might.

02:49:18.317 --> 02:49:19.841
Go away!

02:49:22.387 --> 02:49:23.979
What do you want?

02:49:25.891 --> 02:49:27.552
Do you want to see me?

02:49:28.827 --> 02:49:30.021
Is that it?

02:49:44.142 --> 02:49:48.476
I'm 21 and I'm pretty.
Everyone says I'm pretty.

02:49:48.814 --> 02:49:52.306
- That's the only man who's seen me!
- I know, it's all right.

02:49:52.517 --> 02:49:54.417
He's gone, he's gone.

02:49:56.154 --> 02:49:57.781
You know what's funny?

02:49:59.324 --> 02:50:01.383
I wanted to ask him in.

02:50:03.495 --> 02:50:05.053
Just once...

02:50:06.665 --> 02:50:08.690
...I wanted somebody.

02:50:25.450 --> 02:50:27.975
What is the Ural Soviet up to?

02:50:28.220 --> 02:50:30.688
The Whites are three days away.

02:50:30.889 --> 02:50:33.517
- Can't you make up your minds?
- All right, comrade.

02:50:33.725 --> 02:50:36.091
We've had fresh instructions
from the Kremlin.

02:50:36.294 --> 02:50:39.752
They express confidence in our
ability to handle this difficult...

02:50:39.965 --> 02:50:42.490
What exactly did they say?

02:50:42.701 --> 02:50:43.861
Let me see.

02:50:44.336 --> 02:50:45.633
I've committed it to memory.

02:50:45.837 --> 02:50:49.068
The cable read: "We leave
the matter in your hands."

02:50:49.408 --> 02:50:52.036
Well, that's taking a position,
isn't it?

02:50:52.878 --> 02:50:54.675
Now, what are my orders?

02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:58.782
It's my duty as a member of the
Ural Presidium to act as an observer...

02:50:58.984 --> 02:51:00.815
Observer? Of what?

02:51:01.019 --> 02:51:01.951
The execution.

02:51:02.154 --> 02:51:03.587
That's already decided.

02:51:03.789 --> 02:51:05.347
The question now is, how many?

02:51:05.557 --> 02:51:07.548
You're having a debate on it?

02:51:07.759 --> 02:51:09.989
Everything must be above reproach.

02:51:10.195 --> 02:51:12.254
We hope to bring it
to a vote this afternoon.

02:51:12.464 --> 02:51:16.161
There's a division of opinion about
the children. But as for the Tsar...

02:51:20.505 --> 02:51:22.370
Was it necessary to remove the view?

02:51:22.574 --> 02:51:23.700
Security.

02:51:27.179 --> 02:51:28.237
Good day.

02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:29.447
Good day.

02:51:46.898 --> 02:51:48.365
No sun today?

02:51:49.534 --> 02:51:50.865
What a shame.

02:51:51.636 --> 02:51:53.797
I suppose you're not well enough.

02:51:54.639 --> 02:51:56.470
What's it like being ill?

02:51:58.110 --> 02:52:00.340
What's it like having gray eyes?

02:52:00.946 --> 02:52:02.277
It can't be nice...

02:52:02.681 --> 02:52:05.275
...being an invalid at your age.

02:52:05.617 --> 02:52:08.643
And they can't do anything
to help one.

02:52:09.087 --> 02:52:10.850
What a pity.

02:53:11.783 --> 02:53:12.613
It's gold!

02:53:12.817 --> 02:53:14.216
Let it go!

02:53:40.612 --> 02:53:41.601
You're dead!

02:53:42.113 --> 02:53:43.705
That's all you know about.

02:53:43.915 --> 02:53:45.177
You murder everything!

02:53:45.383 --> 02:53:47.146
You hurt him, and by God...

02:53:48.220 --> 02:53:49.619
You struck the Tsar!

02:54:01.433 --> 02:54:02.900
Bring him outside!

02:54:04.502 --> 02:54:06.493
First thing each morning...

02:54:06.805 --> 02:54:07.999
...put Alexis' brace on.

02:54:08.206 --> 02:54:09.468
I won't let them hurt you!

02:54:09.674 --> 02:54:11.266
Strap it on tight,
Your Majesty.

02:54:11.476 --> 02:54:14.639
He doesn't like it,
but it's good for him.

02:54:15.046 --> 02:54:16.240
Dear God!

02:54:20.552 --> 02:54:22.019
I won't let them.

02:54:45.410 --> 02:54:47.002
You can save him.

02:54:47.445 --> 02:54:48.537
You can stop it.

02:54:48.913 --> 02:54:49.880
Certainly.

02:54:50.115 --> 02:54:53.050
Your man started it.
He should be punished.

02:54:53.251 --> 02:54:54.343
He will be.

02:54:54.552 --> 02:54:55.610
And Nagorny?

02:54:57.622 --> 02:54:59.283
Taking someone's life.

02:55:00.325 --> 02:55:01.656
No man should have that power.

02:55:02.460 --> 02:55:03.859
You had it.

02:55:04.129 --> 02:55:04.993
Yes.

02:55:06.998 --> 02:55:10.798
And I have learned that a strong man
has no need of power.

02:55:11.002 --> 02:55:13.436
And a weak man is destroyed by it.

02:55:14.739 --> 02:55:17.503
I am being punished
for what I have done.

02:55:18.176 --> 02:55:20.110
Nagorny is innocent.

02:55:20.312 --> 02:55:21.745
He's like a child.

02:55:22.047 --> 02:55:24.140
You don't shoot children, do you?

02:55:24.416 --> 02:55:27.010
In your new world,
are there penalties for innocence?

02:55:27.385 --> 02:55:28.511
Sometimes.

02:55:31.690 --> 02:55:34.921
It takes a wise judge
to know who is innocent...

02:55:35.727 --> 02:55:37.251
...and who is guilty.

02:55:38.630 --> 02:55:40.222
I wish I knew.

02:55:43.735 --> 02:55:45.202
I'll do what I can.

02:55:46.504 --> 02:55:47.368
Thank you.

02:55:54.546 --> 02:55:56.741
I'd like to kill him.

02:55:57.549 --> 02:55:59.016
Wait and see.

02:56:00.085 --> 02:56:01.279
He'll do what's right.

02:56:01.553 --> 02:56:02.952
I know him. He's a murderer.

02:56:03.154 --> 02:56:04.519
He's a thoughtful man.

02:56:04.723 --> 02:56:06.554
He'll send Nagorny back to us.

02:56:06.758 --> 02:56:08.089
He's not a monster.

02:56:09.294 --> 02:56:12.127
I've never known a heart
without some murder in it.

02:56:13.565 --> 02:56:15.157
I made these men.

02:56:16.067 --> 02:56:17.898
They are our Russians.

02:56:18.303 --> 02:56:20.464
I am responsible for what they are.

02:56:20.939 --> 02:56:22.406
I let them starve.

02:56:22.674 --> 02:56:25.234
I put them in prisons
and I shot them.

02:56:26.378 --> 02:56:28.209
If there's hatred in them now...

02:56:28.413 --> 02:56:30.108
...I put it there.

02:56:31.616 --> 02:56:34.642
But they are filled with love.

02:56:35.086 --> 02:56:36.553
And with mercy too.

02:56:37.455 --> 02:56:39.047
You must remember that.

02:56:39.257 --> 02:56:41.521
They are all murderers.

02:56:47.465 --> 02:56:49.831
I'd like to kill them all.

02:57:00.779 --> 02:57:02.576
Acid? Gasoline?

02:57:02.847 --> 02:57:04.974
Can't you just throw them
down the mineshaft?

02:57:05.183 --> 02:57:07.549
You don't approve of this, comrade?

02:57:07.752 --> 02:57:09.515
No, I quite approve...

02:57:09.721 --> 02:57:13.122
...of terror, arson, murder.
Any tool that serves the revolution.

02:57:13.324 --> 02:57:17.192
As a member of the Ural Presidium,
it's my duty to see that...

02:57:36.481 --> 02:57:38.278
They must hurt very much.

02:57:38.917 --> 02:57:40.077
My fingers.

02:57:41.419 --> 02:57:43.512
They work well enough for this.

02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:46.186
I couldn't play the piano now.

02:57:47.058 --> 02:57:49.458
I used to hear you practicing
when I was in my office.

02:57:49.661 --> 02:57:50.559
Did you?

02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:53.695
Schumann and Schubert.

02:57:54.632 --> 02:57:56.497
I never thought much
of your voice.

02:57:56.734 --> 02:57:57.758
Didn’t you?

02:57:59.771 --> 02:58:01.636
Never told me that before.

02:58:02.507 --> 02:58:05.169
I suddenly thought of
the yacht this morning.

02:58:05.844 --> 02:58:08.506
Remember how the band
used to play all the time?

02:58:09.547 --> 02:58:11.037
And out of tune.

02:58:11.549 --> 02:58:12.880
Do you think they drank?

02:58:13.084 --> 02:58:14.711
How did that waltz go?

02:58:22.727 --> 02:58:24.592
You're no better than the band.

02:58:54.259 --> 02:58:55.886
Your beautiful hands.

02:59:00.298 --> 02:59:01.492
The girls.

02:59:03.101 --> 02:59:04.568
They won't come in.

02:59:05.236 --> 02:59:06.362
We're alone.

02:59:08.072 --> 02:59:09.835
I still want you so much.

02:59:11.743 --> 02:59:13.574
Nothing can change that, Sunny.

02:59:15.079 --> 02:59:16.410
I do love you.

02:59:33.164 --> 02:59:34.893
I'm sure it's getting nearer.

02:59:35.099 --> 02:59:36.293
How far now?

02:59:38.436 --> 02:59:40.028
It's hard to tell.

02:59:41.606 --> 02:59:43.096
Perhaps thirty miles.

02:59:43.942 --> 02:59:45.239
Thirty miles.

02:59:52.350 --> 02:59:54.341
They've been here all morning.

02:59:54.752 --> 02:59:56.310
Why don't they go away?

03:00:10.935 --> 03:00:12.630
Can't they make up their minds?

03:00:14.339 --> 03:00:15.931
I'm sure it's getting nearer.

03:00:18.343 --> 03:00:19.742
I'm going to phone again.

03:00:30.455 --> 03:00:31.285
Go on.

03:00:39.430 --> 03:00:40.294
It's all of them.

03:00:40.665 --> 03:00:42.462
I could have told you that.

03:00:43.668 --> 03:00:44.965
It's about time.

03:00:47.372 --> 03:00:48.862
I kept their mail.

03:00:49.073 --> 03:00:51.507
I didn't know whether
they ought to have it.

03:00:51.743 --> 03:00:53.677
Shall I give it to them now?

03:00:53.878 --> 03:00:55.743
Would it be cruel...

03:00:56.147 --> 03:00:57.910
...or kind?

03:00:58.149 --> 03:01:01.016
I don't know how to judge
these things.

03:01:01.886 --> 03:01:04.116
I don't think anyone knows.

03:01:11.062 --> 03:01:12.029
Listen.

03:01:12.230 --> 03:01:13.595
Nikolasha writes:

03:01:13.798 --> 03:01:16.358
"Saw Vladimir walking in
the Nevsky Prospect.

03:01:16.567 --> 03:01:19.764
Old fool, all dressed up
in his Imperial gold uniform.

03:01:20.405 --> 03:01:22.032
Nobody seems to mind."

03:01:23.675 --> 03:01:25.074
Listen to Grandmama:

03:01:25.276 --> 03:01:26.743
"Remember to dress for dinner.

03:01:26.944 --> 03:01:30.505
It keeps up one's dignity
and impresses the people."

03:01:30.715 --> 03:01:32.182
Dress for dinner?

03:01:32.383 --> 03:01:34.977
Nikolasha says he'll
join her soon in the Crimea.

03:01:35.186 --> 03:01:36.175
Vladimir.

03:01:36.387 --> 03:01:38.855
He says:
"<i>Ma chère</i>, I've seen this Lenin.

03:01:39.057 --> 03:01:41.048
His suit is wrinkled
and he wears a worker's cap.

03:01:41.259 --> 03:01:43.193
The man will never make a Tsar."

03:01:43.628 --> 03:01:45.528
<i>Monsieur</i> Gilliard's still
in Ekaterinburg.

03:01:45.730 --> 03:01:47.459
He's trying to come and see us.

03:01:47.665 --> 03:01:50.259
Mama's off to England
in a month or so.

03:01:50.635 --> 03:01:52.660
She says the spring
was late this year...

03:01:53.004 --> 03:01:54.301
...but very beautiful.

03:01:57.075 --> 03:01:59.305
Lord, but it's good to be alive!

03:02:01.546 --> 03:02:04.106
The world is like a field in summer...

03:02:04.315 --> 03:02:06.215
...bursting with good things.

03:02:06.584 --> 03:02:07.414
One day...

03:02:08.419 --> 03:02:10.319
...when all the wars are over...

03:02:10.955 --> 03:02:13.480
...someone young will
lead us to the harvest.

03:02:14.592 --> 03:02:16.287
As long as there are children...

03:02:16.561 --> 03:02:18.529
...anything is possible.

03:02:49.060 --> 03:02:49.958
What's happened?

03:02:50.194 --> 03:02:52.321
Get your family dressed.

03:02:52.530 --> 03:02:54.225
- Why?
- We're leaving.

03:02:59.937 --> 03:03:01.063
Don't be afraid.

03:03:01.272 --> 03:03:03.536
The White Army
must have broken through.

03:03:03.741 --> 03:03:05.231
Help Anastasia.

03:04:02.433 --> 03:04:04.060
Wait in here, please.
