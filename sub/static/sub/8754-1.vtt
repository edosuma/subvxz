WEBVTT

00:10.428 --> 00:12.533
I wouldn't want to mess with this woman.

00:12.633 --> 00:14.241
She's very powerful.

00:14.341 --> 00:17.090
The last owner killed all
three of her husbands.

00:17.092 --> 00:19.263
It hurts so much.

00:19.265 --> 00:21.402
I thought I was going to die.

00:21.404 --> 00:23.944
It absolutely terrified me.

00:23.946 --> 00:25.412
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:25.414 --> 00:27.120
In the name of Jesus, you go.

00:27.122 --> 00:29.127
Vicious.

00:29.129 --> 00:32.329
They're burning them alive.

00:32.331 --> 00:35.007
Something bad's going to happen.

00:35.009 --> 00:37.916
My name is Amy Allan.

00:37.918 --> 00:39.283
There's panic.

00:39.285 --> 00:40.720
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:40.722 --> 00:41.790
I see dead people.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.928
They all died horribly.

00:43.930 --> 00:45.634
I speak to dead people.

00:45.636 --> 00:47.040
Get out of here.

00:47.042 --> 00:48.674
And they speak to me.

00:48.676 --> 00:50.713
Vicious.

00:50.715 --> 00:53.863
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:53.865 --> 00:55.569
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

00:55.571 --> 00:57.146
I rely on my partner.

00:57.148 --> 00:58.782
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:58.784 --> 01:00.685
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:00.687 --> 01:02.389
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:02.391 --> 01:06.061
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:06.063 --> 01:07.563
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:07.565 --> 01:08.733
It's my job to reveal them.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.005
This is not good.

01:11.007 --> 01:12.744
But Steve and I never speak...

01:12.746 --> 01:14.780
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:14.782 --> 01:16.549
Until the very end.

01:16.551 --> 01:18.022
I want my life back.

01:18.024 --> 01:20.427
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:20.429 --> 01:22.031
Is he trying to kill her?

01:22.033 --> 01:23.301
Or time to get out.

01:23.303 --> 01:24.974
Oh, my god.

01:24.976 --> 01:26.378
This is going to kill us.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.529 --> 01:46.097
This is the first time

01:46.099 --> 01:48.633
Amy and I are doing an
investigation overseas together.

01:48.635 --> 01:52.341
We're in Jamaica,
a Caribbean Island just south of Cuba.

01:52.343 --> 01:56.316
Now, the reason we're here is
I got a call from a young expat

01:56.318 --> 01:58.754
who took over the family business.

01:58.756 --> 02:02.294
It's a historic plantation
house in Montego Bay.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.280
He says the activity is out of control.

02:04.380 --> 02:06.785
His employees are scared,

02:06.787 --> 02:08.619
guests are running out
of the place screaming,

02:08.621 --> 02:10.991
and now even his kids are affected.

02:10.994 --> 02:12.128
He says if we can't help him,

02:12.130 --> 02:13.663
he's gonna pack his things and leave.

02:20.239 --> 02:22.310
Before Amy arrives,

02:22.312 --> 02:25.313
I clear the area of any leading information.

02:27.149 --> 02:30.420
Photographs and artwork
can influence her findings,

02:30.422 --> 02:33.620
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

02:33.622 --> 02:34.854
When I'm finished,

02:34.856 --> 02:40.327
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:52.477 --> 02:54.511
There's this man.

02:54.513 --> 02:57.849
He was treated like a dog. He had a chain.

02:57.851 --> 03:01.018
Lots of, uh, blood.

03:02.856 --> 03:05.159
They were setting people on fire.

03:05.161 --> 03:06.794
They're burning them alive.

03:06.796 --> 03:10.199
You know, pretty [Bleep] brutal [Bleep]

03:24.257 --> 03:27.192
Well, Michael,
this is an incredible building

03:27.194 --> 03:28.244
with spectacular views.

03:28.344 --> 03:30.144
But I assume you guys don't live here

03:30.244 --> 03:33.111
because it looks like it's set up as,
like a museum.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.614
You're exactly right. It's a museum.

03:34.616 --> 03:37.659
But it, first,
it was a sugarcane plantation.

03:37.759 --> 03:38.070
Okay.

03:38.170 --> 03:41.899
And eventually,
my father bought this place in the mid-'60s

03:41.999 --> 03:45.064
and then started restoring
this Rose Hall Great House.

03:45.066 --> 03:47.667
What kind of shape was the place
in when your father took over?

03:47.669 --> 03:49.102
Well, when my father took over,

03:49.104 --> 03:52.700
nobody had lived here for,
I believe, over 60 years.

03:52.702 --> 03:55.705
You'd never know it was the same building.

03:55.707 --> 03:57.106
How long have you been running this place?

03:57.108 --> 03:58.708
For close to three years now.

03:58.710 --> 04:00.409
Before that, I was in banking.

04:00.411 --> 04:03.111
And I worked in finance,
actually, in New York City.

04:03.113 --> 04:07.715
It had been a 50-year, you know,
passion project for my father.

04:07.717 --> 04:10.486
And it was very important
for me to uphold that legacy.

04:10.488 --> 04:12.055
Now, Michael, what kind of things

04:12.057 --> 04:14.256
are we talking about that
people are experiencing?

04:14.258 --> 04:16.959
It really runs the gamut from seeing things

04:16.961 --> 04:20.293
to hearing things

04:20.296 --> 04:22.697
to actually feeling as
if they've been touched

04:22.699 --> 04:25.600
to, in the worst case,
feeling as if they've been pushed.

04:25.602 --> 04:28.268
But for me, you know, the final straw

04:28.270 --> 04:29.739
was my daughter had had an experience.

04:29.741 --> 04:31.141
She was very scared

04:31.143 --> 04:34.476
and had a hard time being
around here after that.

04:34.478 --> 04:35.743
What about yourself, any experiences?

04:35.745 --> 04:36.744
Yes.

04:36.746 --> 04:38.279
When I would go up the staircase

04:38.281 --> 04:40.247
and start going the rounds to the bedrooms,

04:40.249 --> 04:42.116
I felt as if there was a presence there,

04:42.118 --> 04:44.183
that somebody was on my back.

04:44.185 --> 04:46.350
But really, the reason why I called you

04:46.352 --> 04:48.652
was I was really worried about the guests,

04:48.654 --> 04:51.053
the employees who are
here on a regular basis,

04:51.055 --> 04:52.519
and I'm worried about my kids.

04:52.521 --> 04:55.318
Now, has the activity always been bad?

04:55.320 --> 04:57.851
Activity didn't pick up till we
started doing the night tour.

04:57.853 --> 04:59.519
When did the night tour start?

04:59.521 --> 05:01.755
The night tour started about two years ago.

05:01.757 --> 05:03.257
Okay, so, now,
what kind of tours are we talking about?

05:03.259 --> 05:04.625
It's for the most part historical.

05:04.627 --> 05:05.826
Okay, so these people

05:05.828 --> 05:07.726
- aren't coming in here ghost hunting?
- No.

05:07.728 --> 05:10.328
Okay, so, what kind of history
are you covering on this tour?

05:10.330 --> 05:13.330
The last mistress of the
house was Annie Palmer,

05:13.332 --> 05:15.999
who supposedly had, within 12 years,

05:16.001 --> 05:19.035
killed three husbands and countless slaves

05:19.037 --> 05:20.371
and was finally murdered at the house.

05:20.373 --> 05:23.236
And she's actually buried
over on the property,

05:23.238 --> 05:24.336
right over there.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.742
There's this woman.

05:32.744 --> 05:36.945
And she's very well-groomed.

05:36.947 --> 05:41.651
She's so, like, an authority,
like a powerful person.

05:41.653 --> 05:44.019
She's very in control.

05:44.021 --> 05:46.889
I would want to mess with this woman.

05:46.891 --> 05:50.393
Something is going on

05:50.395 --> 05:55.031
that is making her very
stressed out and angry.

05:57.201 --> 06:03.738
She definitely is present here.

06:10.574 --> 06:12.708
So, Mrs. Rollins,
it's good to meet with you.

06:12.710 --> 06:13.877
Likewise.

06:13.879 --> 06:15.413
So, I was talking to your son.

06:15.415 --> 06:17.047
And it sounds like you
got some problems here.

06:17.049 --> 06:18.281
Mm-hmm.

06:18.283 --> 06:19.449
Okay, so, I'm curious.

06:19.451 --> 06:20.983
What actually drew you guys to this place?

06:20.985 --> 06:23.886
Well, my husband came for a vacation,

06:23.888 --> 06:25.856
and what really impressed
him the most were the people.

06:25.858 --> 06:30.162
There's just a <i> joie de vivre,
</i> a laughter, a joy about them.

06:30.164 --> 06:32.566
But when Michael came
and brought his family,

06:32.568 --> 06:34.169
I began to think, you know,

06:34.171 --> 06:36.036
"Maybe we should relook at this."

06:36.038 --> 06:38.373
Well, your 8-year-old granddaughter

06:38.375 --> 06:40.278
seems to have had an experience.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.445
Yes. I was shocked.

06:41.447 --> 06:42.845
Now, what about yourself?

06:42.847 --> 06:44.279
Well, you can be here at night

06:44.281 --> 06:46.484
and have the hackles raise
on the back of your neck.

06:46.486 --> 06:47.585
And, I mean, I was on a tour.

06:47.587 --> 06:49.285
There were clanging of chains.

06:49.287 --> 06:51.320
There were things that were going on

06:51.322 --> 06:53.926
that absolutely terrified me.

06:53.928 --> 06:55.862
Okay, so, now, after that happened,

06:55.864 --> 06:57.531
did employees come to you with stories?

06:57.533 --> 06:59.301
Oh, they certainly did. They said, you know,

06:59.303 --> 07:02.336
"The shutters banged,
but they were secured,"

07:02.338 --> 07:04.672
or, "floor creaking, floorboards,"

07:04.674 --> 07:07.475
all kinds of noises, all kinds of things.

07:07.477 --> 07:09.442
And I would not have
thought I was open to it,

07:09.444 --> 07:11.476
but I'm starting to pay
a little more attention.

07:15.014 --> 07:18.451
There was a man here.

07:18.453 --> 07:21.222
I think he went crazy.

07:21.224 --> 07:26.428
This guy causes issues with,
like, living people,

07:26.430 --> 07:29.430
you know, has, like, tantrums.

07:29.432 --> 07:36.275
He'll, like,
run into the wall and the door on purpose.

07:37.478 --> 07:41.212
I'd say this man is the
cause of hundreds of deaths.

07:41.214 --> 07:46.122
And it goes back in his family,

07:46.124 --> 07:50.293
like he comes from a line of monsters.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.227
Vicious.

07:53.896 --> 07:55.797
Very vicious man.

07:55.799 --> 07:57.333
Very vicious.

08:05.346 --> 08:08.746
So, Katherine, I was talking to Daddy,

08:08.748 --> 08:12.883
and he told me that you had
an experience that scared you.

08:12.885 --> 08:14.585
Yeah.

08:14.587 --> 08:15.718
Is that right?

08:15.720 --> 08:17.152
Mm-hmm.

08:17.154 --> 08:19.687
Can you tell me what happened?

08:19.689 --> 08:22.822
Well, we were doing the party
for the opening of the play

08:22.824 --> 08:28.528
that we talk about what happened
when Annie Palmer was alive.

08:28.530 --> 08:30.196
Okay.

08:30.198 --> 08:31.964
And I saw somebody up in
the top of the window.

08:31.966 --> 08:39.004
And she had red lipstick with
black markings over her eyes.

08:39.006 --> 08:41.373
It couldn't have been somebody
that was in the building?

08:41.375 --> 08:42.374
Mnh-mnh.

08:42.376 --> 08:45.582
Just some people at the front bottom.

08:45.584 --> 08:47.483
Okay, but not up here.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.016
Yeah. Not on the top floor.

08:49.018 --> 08:51.153
Now, are you afraid of the building?

08:51.155 --> 08:52.189
Yeah.

08:52.191 --> 08:53.491
I'm never alone when I'm in here.

08:56.497 --> 08:59.532
There's another lady.

08:59.534 --> 09:01.366
She went nuts.

09:01.368 --> 09:03.302
She went crazy.

09:03.304 --> 09:10.745
She is seen... a lot.

09:12.614 --> 09:18.086
And people, male, female,
kids, will see her around.

09:18.088 --> 09:20.990
Like,
it's always like she's moving along the wall.

09:20.992 --> 09:24.896
She's always, like, slithering.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.868
She's kind of spooking me out a little bit.

09:44.174 --> 09:46.712
After meeting with Michael and his family,

09:46.714 --> 09:49.181
I started talking to the
employees of Rose Hall.

09:49.183 --> 09:51.550
It shook.

09:51.552 --> 09:53.516
And Mrs. Rollins wasn't kidding.

09:59.091 --> 10:01.592
Everyone had experiences to share.

10:01.594 --> 10:03.092
My back was to the door.

10:03.094 --> 10:04.159
And the door slammed.

10:04.161 --> 10:05.760
One that really caught my attention

10:05.762 --> 10:08.663
came from a housekeeper named Becken.

10:08.665 --> 10:15.768
A few weeks ago,
right down there, the dungeon,

10:15.770 --> 10:17.902
I go to turn off that light over there.

10:17.904 --> 10:20.907
And then I feel like somebody
holding me around the waist.

10:20.909 --> 10:23.941
I say, "In the name of Jesus, you go."

10:23.943 --> 10:25.742
Now, Becken,
you're sure it couldn't have been

10:25.744 --> 10:27.611
one of the other employees
playing games with you

10:27.613 --> 10:29.981
and grabbing you and then running away?

10:29.983 --> 10:31.514
No, nobody was around.

10:31.516 --> 10:33.702
So,
do you think whatever's here is dangerous?

10:33.727 --> 10:34.272
Yeah.

10:38.454 --> 10:44.463
Crazy Lady makes her whole being felt.

10:44.465 --> 10:46.166
She doesn't just touch them.

10:46.168 --> 10:53.706
She wants to engulf them...
and make them feel her.

10:53.708 --> 10:57.411
She makes you very, very nauseous.

10:57.413 --> 11:01.513
It hurts so much.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.823
How long have you worked here?

11:10.825 --> 11:14.028
I've been here for almost three years.

11:14.030 --> 11:15.995
Have you ever had actual experiences?

11:15.997 --> 11:17.498
I have many experiences.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.567
- You have?
- Yes.

11:18.569 --> 11:20.369
Okay, tell me about them.

11:20.371 --> 11:22.538
We have a lady that plays Annie.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.973
So she stands in Annie Palmer's room,

11:24.975 --> 11:29.012
at her window, looking out at the guests.

11:29.014 --> 11:31.614
There was another lady beside her

11:31.616 --> 11:34.016
in a nice silhouette, white dress.

11:34.018 --> 11:35.552
But there was no face.

11:35.554 --> 11:36.854
Okay.

11:36.856 --> 11:38.890
Now, is she solid like the actor,
or was she, like, misty?

11:38.892 --> 11:40.158
Yeah, she's misty.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.257
She's ghost-like. Yeah.

11:42.259 --> 11:44.058
Okay.

11:44.060 --> 11:46.294
She mimics everything that our Annie does.

11:46.296 --> 11:48.030
You mean, like, her movements?

11:48.032 --> 11:50.299
Yes.

11:50.301 --> 11:52.101
So, what else have you seen?

11:52.103 --> 11:53.236
I saw a gentleman.

11:53.238 --> 11:55.671
- He was black.
- Okay.

11:55.673 --> 11:59.045
And he had some wounds on his skin.

11:59.047 --> 12:00.880
What kind of wounds are we talking about,

12:00.882 --> 12:02.047
like a burn, a stabbing?

12:02.049 --> 12:04.516
Like, a whip wound. Yes.

12:04.518 --> 12:06.418
Okay, so you're assuming that
he was a slave at some point.

12:06.420 --> 12:07.953
- Yes.
- Okay.

12:07.955 --> 12:10.755
Oh, he followed me downstairs.

12:10.757 --> 12:13.724
And I saw six slaves.

12:13.726 --> 12:16.359
I saw one coming from out the dining room,

12:16.361 --> 12:19.331
one from out the morning room,
one from outside,

12:19.333 --> 12:20.730
one from the ballroom.

12:20.732 --> 12:22.964
So they were all coming towards me,

12:22.966 --> 12:25.733
and I couldn't move.

12:25.735 --> 12:27.136
The only thing,

12:27.138 --> 12:31.170
the one that came downstairs with me,
he held my hand.

12:31.172 --> 12:32.271
Okay.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.138
He held on my hands.

12:34.140 --> 12:37.379
And he said, "Come with me."

12:37.381 --> 12:38.715
Now, I've been doing this a long time.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.048
I've heard a lot of stories.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.682
But this slave story you're
telling me is pretty out there.

12:41.684 --> 12:44.686
I know when it's real from when it's not.

12:44.688 --> 12:46.521
Did you take it as something dangerous,

12:46.523 --> 12:47.789
or did you take it as...

12:47.791 --> 12:50.560
I thought I was going to die.

12:53.899 --> 12:56.733
A lot of the dead here, they're pissed.

12:56.735 --> 13:03.474
The things that these dead
people do to the living

13:03.476 --> 13:07.112
could be kind of justifiable

13:07.114 --> 13:11.853
because I think a lot of these people

13:11.855 --> 13:15.923
might have been tortured and kidnapped.

13:17.390 --> 13:20.595
This was done by the people from here.

13:21.764 --> 13:25.063
The dead... may have these guardians.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.063
What are the guardians?

13:29.132 --> 13:31.700
I don't know. They're these big things.

13:35.371 --> 13:39.442
I mean, I'd say they're 10, 12 feet tall.

13:39.444 --> 13:43.944
They have long legs.

13:43.946 --> 13:48.379
They're on all fours.

13:48.381 --> 13:50.549
Honestly, I've never seen anything like that.
Ever, ever, ever.

13:50.551 --> 13:52.319
How many are there?

13:52.321 --> 13:55.589
There's about six or seven of them.

13:55.591 --> 13:58.059
It's like a [Bleep] wall of defense.

13:58.061 --> 13:59.759
But they said something like,

13:59.761 --> 14:02.260
"Stand back," or, "Don't come near here."

14:02.262 --> 14:05.596
They're guarding the dead.

14:10.203 --> 14:12.404
I think that people would have experiences

14:12.406 --> 14:13.873
with them over the years.

14:13.875 --> 14:17.143
They're very powerful and dangerous.

14:17.145 --> 14:22.147
Do you know if this might affect
people that just work here?

14:22.149 --> 14:24.781
It would just destroy them.

14:39.664 --> 14:42.654
Michael, his mom,
and everyone that works at Rose Hall

14:42.754 --> 14:44.892
has really bought into
this Annie Palmer legend.

14:44.894 --> 14:46.793
You know? It's an incredible story.

14:46.795 --> 14:47.927
So I reached out to an author

14:47.929 --> 14:49.362
who has written about the property.

14:49.364 --> 14:51.199
He's out on the island doing research

14:51.201 --> 14:54.301
and agreed to meet me and
separate fact from fiction.

15:01.111 --> 15:04.214
So, Ben, the reason I asked
you to help me out on this case

15:04.216 --> 15:06.515
is I know you're an expert on this stuff.

15:06.517 --> 15:08.417
And I got told this story by my client

15:08.419 --> 15:10.318
that I don't know if
there's any truth to it.

15:10.320 --> 15:14.218
Said there was a woman named
Annie Palmer who lived here.

15:14.220 --> 15:15.386
She killed three of her husbands,

15:15.388 --> 15:17.421
as well as countless slaves.

15:17.423 --> 15:20.791
And to top it off,
they say she's buried right here.

15:20.793 --> 15:22.725
Is any of it true?

15:22.727 --> 15:23.826
Almost none of that's true.

15:23.828 --> 15:25.493
Really?

15:25.495 --> 15:27.295
Essentially,
the Annie Palmer that people talk about,

15:27.297 --> 15:29.298
the one that's supposedly
buried here and that lived here,

15:29.300 --> 15:30.966
it was a composite of two different women

15:30.968 --> 15:33.535
who lived almost a century apart.

15:33.537 --> 15:35.002
Okay, so, who's the first woman?

15:35.004 --> 15:37.472
Well, the very first one was
a woman named Rosa Kelly.

15:37.474 --> 15:40.211
The most interesting thing is
that she had four husbands,

15:40.213 --> 15:41.712
and three of them died
here on this property.

15:41.714 --> 15:44.415
She was on her fourth husband when she died.

15:44.417 --> 15:46.320
Okay,
so what happened to the previous husbands?

15:46.322 --> 15:48.520
The very first one is named Henry Fanning.

15:48.522 --> 15:50.653
He was married to her in 1746,

15:50.655 --> 15:52.822
and he died within six months.

15:52.824 --> 15:54.959
Okay. Do we know how he died?

15:54.961 --> 15:57.060
He died young. We don't know exactly how.

15:57.062 --> 15:59.256
You know, this is the tropics.
This is, you know, the 1700s.

15:59.258 --> 16:02.260
People drop dead of malaria,
all sorts of different things.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.661
Okay, so,
people dying young wasn't uncommon.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.662
Exactly. Exactly.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.365
What about the second husband? Who was he?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.302
A man named George Ash.

16:09.304 --> 16:11.004
And how long does that marriage last?

16:11.006 --> 16:14.305
That marriage lasted two years,
until he himself dies.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.773
Now, what about the third husband?

16:15.775 --> 16:17.341
The third husband was named Norwood Witter,

16:17.343 --> 16:20.212
and he died 12 years after they married.

16:20.214 --> 16:22.213
Now, how do we know she
didn't murder these people?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.782
Well, there's no record that she did.

16:23.784 --> 16:25.085
All right.

16:25.087 --> 16:27.022
So in-between her husbands,
who's running the plantation?

16:27.024 --> 16:28.189
She was.

16:28.191 --> 16:30.625
This is the 1700s.

16:30.627 --> 16:31.762
I mean, this had to be some woman

16:31.764 --> 16:33.329
to take care of a plantation this big.

16:33.331 --> 16:34.396
Mm-hmm.

16:34.398 --> 16:35.932
You can see how some of the stories

16:35.934 --> 16:38.036
might have come about her
being very strong-willed,

16:38.038 --> 16:40.405
you know, and an important person.

16:40.407 --> 16:42.505
Is it possible she's buried here, Rosa?

16:42.507 --> 16:44.007
No. That's not possible.

16:44.009 --> 16:45.109
Why is that?

16:45.111 --> 16:46.581
Because we know where she was buried.

16:46.583 --> 16:47.683
We have record.

16:47.685 --> 16:49.518
She's buried in St. James' Parish,

16:49.520 --> 16:51.152
which isn't too far from here.

16:51.154 --> 16:53.521
Okay,
so the records show that she died in 1790.

16:53.523 --> 16:54.888
How old was she by then?

16:54.890 --> 16:56.355
72.

16:56.357 --> 16:57.690
So this is not her?

16:57.692 --> 16:59.395
There may be somebody buried here,
but it ain't her.

17:02.663 --> 17:07.296
This lady is way back.

17:07.298 --> 17:14.464
I want to go back to, like...
just like, 1700s?

17:14.467 --> 17:17.032
I'm seeing the powerful, angry woman again.

17:17.035 --> 17:19.806
And this time,
she's telling me about her life.

17:19.808 --> 17:21.942
She's very wealthy,

17:21.944 --> 17:25.544
and she's very in control
and very powerful person,

17:25.546 --> 17:28.916
which is weird because she's a female

17:28.918 --> 17:31.350
and this is a long time ago.

17:31.352 --> 17:38.691
But, like,
I feel like she owns like everything.

17:40.829 --> 17:46.098
She's had her share of enemies,
let me tell you,

17:46.100 --> 17:49.101
who have tried to kill her.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.003
So, you said the legend of this Annie Palmer

17:52.005 --> 17:53.238
is a combination of two women.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.006
All right, so, we got the first woman.

17:55.008 --> 17:56.340
What about the second one?

17:56.342 --> 17:58.575
The second one was actually
named Annie Palmer.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.442
Okay, so there <i> was</i> an Annie Palmer.

18:00.444 --> 18:02.078
There <i> was</i> an Annie Palmer,

18:02.080 --> 18:03.312
but there's nothing,

18:03.314 --> 18:05.380
No part of that biography fits her.

18:05.382 --> 18:07.415
The only connection is to her name.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.750
So anything that the legend
says has nothing to do

18:09.752 --> 18:11.152
with the real Annie Palmer.

18:11.154 --> 18:12.155
Essentially, yeah.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.023
All right, so, what do we know about her?

18:14.025 --> 18:17.830
Okay, so this is an image of Annie Palmer.

18:17.832 --> 18:19.835
Now, this is her or we think it's her?

18:19.837 --> 18:21.202
It's said to be of her.

18:21.204 --> 18:22.203
We don't know.

18:22.205 --> 18:23.571
It's a painting from that time.

18:23.573 --> 18:24.840
We know that she was originally English.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.241
She moved here in 1820.

18:26.243 --> 18:30.141
We know that her parents died
when she was fairly young.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.744
Beyond that, she seems to have had

18:32.746 --> 18:35.383
a relatively uneventful upbringing.

18:35.385 --> 18:36.517
Okay, so, what happens with her?

18:36.519 --> 18:38.218
Her husband died in 1827.

18:38.220 --> 18:40.987
Three years later,
she lost the title to the property.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.353
That was basically a year
before the slave rebellion.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.889
After she lost the plantation,

18:44.891 --> 18:46.393
she moved to another part of the island,

18:46.395 --> 18:48.661
and she died in 1846.

18:48.663 --> 18:50.696
- And how old was she?
- 34.

18:50.698 --> 18:51.998
- Okay. Was she murdered?
- No.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.136
As far as we know, natural causes.

18:54.138 --> 18:55.570
Is it possible she's in here?

18:55.572 --> 18:56.837
No, that's not possible.

18:56.839 --> 18:58.271
And how do we know that?

18:58.273 --> 18:59.773
Because we know where she was buried.

18:59.775 --> 19:00.775
We have record of that.

19:00.777 --> 19:01.910
Okay.

19:01.912 --> 19:04.277
So, she's in the same place...

19:04.279 --> 19:05.780
Yup... as Rosa.

19:05.782 --> 19:08.017
Yup. They're both in the same cemetery.

19:10.087 --> 19:11.854
Essentially, none of the stories

19:11.856 --> 19:13.856
of cruelty and sadism and black magic,

19:13.858 --> 19:16.224
all the bad things that
people talk about her,

19:16.226 --> 19:18.360
had no relation to the real Annie Palmer.

19:18.362 --> 19:20.195
Okay.

19:20.197 --> 19:21.997
This crazy lady.

19:21.999 --> 19:23.667
She's pretty important.

19:23.669 --> 19:25.270
It's like she's 1860s.

19:25.272 --> 19:30.774
She had a lot of losses,
starting really early.

19:30.776 --> 19:37.611
This woman,
she went crazy because he father died.

19:37.613 --> 19:40.114
Very attached, very attached to her father.

19:40.116 --> 19:41.313
Very attached.

19:45.186 --> 19:49.591
She seems... very not stable right now.

19:51.327 --> 19:54.298
Lots of darkness.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.671
A lot of darkness here.

20:12.501 --> 20:15.599
Ben mentioned a bloody slave
rebellion in Montego Bay.

20:15.699 --> 20:18.199
I'm heading over to meet
with a local professor

20:18.201 --> 20:19.734
who says the fighting came really close

20:19.736 --> 20:21.202
to the property I'm investigating.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.463
So, Nicole, you told me on the phone

20:31.465 --> 20:34.783
that the slave rebellion
was the most important

20:34.785 --> 20:38.486
and violent event that took
place in Jamaican history.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.690
It was certainly one of the most important.

20:41.692 --> 20:48.663
On December 27, 1831,
this emancipation war started.

20:48.665 --> 20:52.100
This emancipation war would see

20:52.102 --> 20:56.755
60,000 enslaved Africans take arms

20:56.757 --> 20:59.040
against the colonial overlords,

20:59.042 --> 21:01.676
namely the white plantation masters.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.928
Okay, so what kind of a
battle are we talking about?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.046
What would we have seen?

21:05.048 --> 21:07.282
This was a guerrilla fight.

21:07.284 --> 21:08.483
Okay.

21:08.485 --> 21:11.152
But it was also armed combat.

21:11.154 --> 21:13.888
Occasionally, the fields were put on fire.

21:13.890 --> 21:15.340
So, Nicole, let me ask you a question,

21:15.342 --> 21:16.925
as far as the property I'm investigating.

21:16.927 --> 21:21.062
How close did this whole uprising get to it?

21:21.064 --> 21:25.033
Palmyra Plantation,
which was about two miles away, was burnt.

21:25.035 --> 21:28.870
So it was probably likely
that the enslaved Africans,

21:28.872 --> 21:30.572
as well as the white management,

21:30.574 --> 21:31.906
if they couldn't see it,

21:31.908 --> 21:34.142
they could at least smell what was going on.

21:34.144 --> 21:36.044
So, how long does this rebellion last?

21:36.046 --> 21:37.879
It was actually 10 days.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.749
I'm sure a lot of people
got killed on both sides.

21:40.751 --> 21:42.784
Not quite.

21:42.786 --> 21:45.453
You see, over 500 people we killed,

21:45.455 --> 21:49.190
and 14 of these individuals were white.

21:49.192 --> 21:51.192
Okay, so what did the plantation owners do

21:51.194 --> 21:52.861
after they stopped the rebellion?

21:52.863 --> 21:56.231
This was actually one of the
most heart-rending part of it.

21:56.233 --> 22:00.435
You see, innocent persons of color

22:00.437 --> 22:02.570
could easily be rounded up.

22:02.572 --> 22:06.474
312 were judicially executed.

22:06.476 --> 22:10.245
Several enslaved Africans
were shot on the spot.

22:10.247 --> 22:12.580
In fact, they executed so many people

22:12.582 --> 22:13.982
that the bodies would pile up.

22:13.984 --> 22:16.401
Eventually, slavery was abolished.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.420
When did that happen here?

22:18.422 --> 22:21.289
The emancipation bill was passed.

22:21.291 --> 22:25.326
By August 1, 1834, slavery ended.

22:30.500 --> 22:33.535
I'm seeing a lot of different things here.

22:33.537 --> 22:37.906
Like, first I'm feeling, like,
all of this panic and distress.

22:37.908 --> 22:41.609
Someone's bleeding, bleeding, cut, stabbed.

22:42.512 --> 22:45.580
It feels more like a stab, right here.

22:45.582 --> 22:46.948
Right here.

22:46.950 --> 22:50.785
This is a male, young male.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.787
Tongue ripped out.

22:52.789 --> 22:55.990
There's a lot of [Bleep] horrible things

22:55.992 --> 22:57.559
being done to people.

23:03.166 --> 23:05.183
Now that I know the
truth about Annie Palmer

23:05.185 --> 23:06.401
and the bloody slave rebellion,

23:06.403 --> 23:08.002
I need to see if there's anything else

23:08.004 --> 23:09.971
that could help my case.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.589
So I'm at the local library.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.745
Searching for old records,
I find a deadly rampage

23:17.747 --> 23:20.248
involving a man named Rudolph Franklin.

23:20.250 --> 23:23.051
It turns out,
he lived on Rose Hall property.

23:23.053 --> 23:26.921
I'm heading over to meet a
local Rastafarian activist

23:26.923 --> 23:28.890
who knows all about this deadly shoot-out.

23:28.892 --> 23:32.477
He told me the information he's
got will be critical to my case.

23:38.969 --> 23:41.069
Mr. Ras Karbi, I appreciate you meeting me.

23:41.071 --> 23:44.038
Saw an article during my research

23:44.040 --> 23:47.008
about a shoot-out between
Rastafarians and police

23:47.010 --> 23:48.409
that was pretty deadly.

23:48.411 --> 23:50.028
When I looked at the research,

23:50.030 --> 23:51.813
everything came back to Rose Hall

23:51.815 --> 23:53.715
and the property I'm investigating.

23:53.717 --> 23:56.184
So I wanted to find out from you,

23:56.186 --> 23:57.652
if you knew exactly what happened.

23:57.654 --> 24:01.589
What actually took place was this guy,
Rudolph Franklin,

24:01.591 --> 24:03.708
who used to live on the Rose Hall property

24:03.710 --> 24:05.193
and he was a worker there.

24:05.195 --> 24:06.778
And he's gotten some land

24:06.780 --> 24:09.330
that he claimed that his father's given him.

24:09.332 --> 24:12.483
So there was a dispute because
they want him off the land.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.369
Right, Rastas weren't welcome.

24:14.371 --> 24:15.787
Now, did he have any paperwork

24:15.789 --> 24:17.572
documenting that he owned that property?

24:17.574 --> 24:19.140
Most Jamaicans didn't have paperwork

24:19.142 --> 24:20.675
that they owned any property.

24:20.677 --> 24:23.044
So, now, what happens in 1961,
when the cops do eventually...?

24:23.046 --> 24:25.263
In 1961, a dispute developed.

24:25.265 --> 24:27.565
Rudolph Franklin had his machete, okay?

24:27.567 --> 24:29.017
He was on his property.

24:29.019 --> 24:31.252
And they told him to drop his machete.

24:31.254 --> 24:35.189
He perhaps refused to drop the machete,
so he was shot.

24:35.191 --> 24:37.258
And they left him to die in the grass.

24:37.260 --> 24:39.594
So, he survived the shooting.

24:39.596 --> 24:42.997
He decided to come back
with a personal grudge

24:42.999 --> 24:44.666
or a personal revenge.

24:44.668 --> 24:47.268
So he got some friends together.

24:47.270 --> 24:48.303
So, they went to the gas station.

24:48.305 --> 24:50.238
Gas station's set on fire. Cops came.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.107
And there was a big clash

24:53.109 --> 24:57.211
between Franklin and his
men and the policemen.

24:57.213 --> 24:59.981
You know, what was the outcome
of this whole, big mess?

24:59.983 --> 25:04.052
By the time it was over,
eight people got killed.

25:04.054 --> 25:07.221
One was... Franklin himself got killed.

25:07.223 --> 25:11.693
Two friends that he brought there,
two policemen got shot.

25:11.695 --> 25:13.945
One that was assisting the police

25:13.947 --> 25:16.748
also got hacked to death by Franklin's men.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.366
And two other bystanders.

25:21.838 --> 25:24.172
So there's two people.

25:24.174 --> 25:26.975
They're both lying on the ground.

25:26.977 --> 25:31.779
It's dark out.
There's a fire that's burning.

25:31.781 --> 25:37.785
And there's a man who...
is standing over them.

25:37.787 --> 25:40.888
And it's almost like a butchering,

25:40.890 --> 25:45.743
like you would butcher an animal,
like he's being gutted.

25:58.375 --> 26:00.575
I saw several dead people during my walk,

26:00.577 --> 26:03.244
but the bizarre creatures
guarding the dead outside

26:03.246 --> 26:06.581
pose the biggest threat.

26:06.583 --> 26:09.217
There were several trees,

26:09.219 --> 26:12.070
and there were these things

26:12.072 --> 26:18.292
that were probably like 10 or 12 feet tall.

26:18.294 --> 26:22.163
Like a fly with no head.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.132
- And no face?
- No face.

26:24.134 --> 26:29.103
It was dark... very, very dark.

26:30.540 --> 26:32.040
Is this what you saw?

26:34.411 --> 26:36.911
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:57.008 --> 26:59.792
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:59.794 --> 27:01.761
we're ready to reveal our findings

27:01.763 --> 27:04.964
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

27:04.966 --> 27:06.599
Amy, I'd like you to meet Michael.

27:06.601 --> 27:10.436
Now, Michael gave up a banking
job in New York a few years ago

27:10.438 --> 27:12.204
to come here and run this historic place,

27:12.206 --> 27:15.474
but he got a lot more than he bargained for.

27:15.476 --> 27:17.310
This is his mom, Mrs. Rollins.

27:17.312 --> 27:20.479
Back in 1965,
her husband purchased this place.

27:20.481 --> 27:24.684
This is what it looked like
when they purchased it.

27:24.686 --> 27:28.821
They spent years restoring
it to what it is today.

27:28.823 --> 27:29.989
And this is Janique.

27:29.991 --> 27:33.192
She's an employee of Rose Hall.

27:33.194 --> 27:35.728
And she's had more than her
fair share of experiences.

27:35.730 --> 27:38.230
Now, Michael's the one that called us in.

27:38.232 --> 27:40.232
Activity's gotten really bad,

27:40.234 --> 27:41.400
and he wants to make sure

27:41.402 --> 27:42.868
he can continue on with the family legacy.

27:42.870 --> 27:46.572
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

27:46.574 --> 27:48.941
I'm gonna have her describe
what she saw on her walk.

27:48.943 --> 27:55.181
When I arrived, there was a lot
of chaos that was happening.

27:55.183 --> 28:00.820
I immediately encountered a
male who is bound by his leg,

28:00.822 --> 28:05.992
and he was telling me how he
had been here for a long time.

28:05.994 --> 28:09.862
But he was someone who was
treated really like an animal.

28:09.864 --> 28:12.732
Then, right after him,

28:12.734 --> 28:17.803
I saw people were lined
up and then set on fire.

28:17.805 --> 28:21.207
Then they were just kind
of scattered and running,

28:21.209 --> 28:23.743
while they are engulfed in flames.

28:25.413 --> 28:30.249
I think that this happened a very,
very long time ago.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.518
That's pretty easy to explain.

28:32.520 --> 28:36.222
I mean, this place was a slave
plantation back in the 1700s.

28:36.224 --> 28:39.692
At its peak, it had 500 slaves

28:39.694 --> 28:41.694
that lived, died, and were buried here.

28:41.696 --> 28:46.298
Now, you saw a lot of violence and a fire.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.550
Yeah.

28:47.552 --> 28:49.769
Now,
it kind of sounds like you're talking about

28:49.771 --> 28:53.172
the slave rebellion that took
place on December 27, 1831.

28:53.174 --> 28:55.541
Now, the slaves burnt down the plantation

28:55.543 --> 28:58.077
and took up arms to fight for their freedom.

28:58.079 --> 28:59.879
Battle lasted 10 days.

28:59.881 --> 29:01.714
Slaves were crushed.

29:01.716 --> 29:05.017
221 died during that 10-day battle.

29:05.019 --> 29:07.820
Only 14 of those 221 were white.

29:07.822 --> 29:10.890
Now, afterwards, the whites that
were here were out for blood.

29:10.892 --> 29:12.892
They wind up rounding up any blacks

29:12.894 --> 29:15.995
they could find on the streets,
threw them in jail, tried them,

29:15.997 --> 29:18.964
and 312 were executed.

29:18.966 --> 29:20.633
Even though the whites won that battle,

29:20.635 --> 29:21.801
they lost the war

29:21.803 --> 29:23.269
because slavery was abolished in 1834 here.

29:24.339 --> 29:29.338
Now, Janique,
you had experiences with slaves.

29:29.438 --> 29:30.437
Yeah.

29:30.439 --> 29:32.272
Explain to Amy what you encountered.

29:32.274 --> 29:33.841
So, I went upstairs,

29:33.843 --> 29:35.576
and I was cleaning the commode.

29:35.578 --> 29:37.578
And there was a gentlemen behind me.

29:37.580 --> 29:38.746
You know, he's black.

29:38.748 --> 29:41.181
He had wounds on his skin,

29:41.183 --> 29:42.766
and he grabbed my hand.

29:42.768 --> 29:45.719
And he was saying, "Come with me."

29:45.721 --> 29:48.972
After a few minutes or so,
there was a gentleman

29:48.974 --> 29:51.625
coming from all corners of the house,

29:51.627 --> 29:53.694
about four of them, all slaves.

29:53.696 --> 29:55.229
It seems all wounded.

29:55.231 --> 30:00.501
I was afraid that I might
have died or something.

30:03.856 --> 30:05.856
So, what else happened on your walk?

30:05.858 --> 30:09.076
I encountered this one guy.

30:09.078 --> 30:11.045
This is his favorite area.

30:11.047 --> 30:20.154
He was very angry, a very forceful person.

30:20.156 --> 30:24.558
This guy causes issues with,
like, living people.

30:24.560 --> 30:27.561
You know? Has, like, tantrums.

30:27.563 --> 30:34.868
He'll, like,
run into the wall and the door on purpose.

30:34.870 --> 30:38.439
You've had a lot of people
telling you they hear footsteps?

30:38.441 --> 30:39.973
I've had people telling me

30:39.975 --> 30:41.975
that they'll be on the second floor.

30:41.977 --> 30:44.211
And they'll hear things downstairs.

30:44.213 --> 30:46.313
There's a lot of activity,
a lot of movement,

30:46.315 --> 30:48.615
and all of that without people really here.

30:48.617 --> 30:49.650
Mm-hmm.

30:49.652 --> 30:50.984
Yeah, that's how he operates.

30:54.056 --> 30:56.590
So, what else did you see?

30:56.592 --> 30:59.259
There were two women that
I encountered on my walk.

30:59.261 --> 31:04.064
The first one was extremely old,
very, very wealthy.

31:04.066 --> 31:07.701
She is from probably 1600s, 1700s.

31:07.703 --> 31:10.921
She was someone who was a decision-maker

31:10.923 --> 31:12.973
and could implement power,

31:12.975 --> 31:16.710
and from my knowledge,
as a woman at <i> that</i> time,

31:16.712 --> 31:18.345
that didn't happen.

31:18.347 --> 31:20.914
She was in control.

31:20.916 --> 31:23.550
Now, you've heard stories for years,
right, Mrs. Rollins,

31:23.552 --> 31:25.686
about people seeing an
apparition of a woman.

31:25.688 --> 31:26.720
Yes.

31:27.723 --> 31:29.990
Michael, you had told me your
daughter saw an apparition.

31:29.992 --> 31:31.358
Was it upstairs?

31:31.360 --> 31:33.894
Yeah, upstairs in the far bedroom,
in the far corner.

31:33.896 --> 31:35.696
Which would be?

31:35.698 --> 31:37.064
- Annie's room.
- Right.

31:37.066 --> 31:39.700
Now's probably a good time to tell Amy

31:39.702 --> 31:42.669
about the legend of Annie Palmer

31:42.671 --> 31:44.905
that everybody at this
table believes is true

31:44.907 --> 31:48.008
and everybody in town does,
including my cab driver.

31:48.010 --> 31:52.062
Supposedly, she was a tyrannical
and sadistic slave owner

31:52.064 --> 31:54.114
who ruled with an iron fist.

31:54.116 --> 31:56.116
She murdered three of her husbands,

31:56.118 --> 31:59.353
as well as countless slaves.

31:59.355 --> 32:01.255
Apparently, she's also buried
right here on the property.

32:01.257 --> 32:04.725
But, Amy, this is only the legend.

32:04.727 --> 32:06.593
I did my own research,

32:06.595 --> 32:08.228
and I'll tell you about it in a minute.

32:08.230 --> 32:11.465
Michael,
tell Amy about the Annie Palmer tours

32:11.467 --> 32:12.733
you run at night.

32:12.735 --> 32:14.735
As of close to two years ago,

32:14.737 --> 32:16.503
we started doing tours at night.

32:16.505 --> 32:18.405
People started hearing things,

32:18.407 --> 32:20.574
feeling as if a presence was there.

32:20.576 --> 32:22.476
They've actually been touched.

32:22.478 --> 32:24.261
And then, in the most extreme cases,

32:24.263 --> 32:26.046
people felt as if they were pushed.

32:26.048 --> 32:27.748
Are you doing reenactments?

32:27.750 --> 32:30.083
Yeah, there are aspects of reenactments.

32:30.085 --> 32:37.591
Are you doing any of...
the bad stuff that happened?

32:37.593 --> 32:39.393
I mean, we designed the night tour

32:39.395 --> 32:42.162
so that we could bring a story to life.

32:42.164 --> 32:44.565
We never dreamt the
spirits would do it for us.

32:47.102 --> 32:50.437
Now,
who was the second woman you saw?

32:50.439 --> 32:53.807
The other woman that I met, who was younger,

32:53.809 --> 32:58.178
from around 1860,
her family... extremely wealthy.

32:58.180 --> 33:00.447
She was very well-taken-care-of.

33:00.449 --> 33:02.816
She had definite father issues.

33:02.818 --> 33:06.537
I do think that people
see her on the staircase.

33:06.539 --> 33:09.323
I think they would see her along the walls.

33:09.325 --> 33:11.792
She does like to be felt.

33:11.794 --> 33:14.928
So she'll literally put
her whole physical self

33:14.930 --> 33:16.930
around a person.

33:16.932 --> 33:20.267
Now, I think I can clear this stuff up.

33:20.269 --> 33:23.136
I talked to an expert who
wrote about Rose Hall.

33:23.138 --> 33:25.672
He says the legend of Annie
Palmer is mostly false.

33:31.513 --> 33:35.682
That legend may be the
combination of two women

33:35.684 --> 33:37.384
that lived on this property
at two different times.

33:39.154 --> 33:44.558
The first woman, Rosa Palmer,
came here in 1746.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.760
Now, Rosa had four husbands,

33:46.762 --> 33:50.764
and three of them died
right here on this property.

33:50.766 --> 33:53.467
There's no indication that
any of them were murdered.

33:53.469 --> 33:55.269
She was also a very strong woman

33:55.271 --> 33:58.205
because she had to run the
plantation in-between husbands.

33:58.207 --> 33:59.873
So, this is another aspect

33:59.875 --> 34:02.142
of what you said about the first woman.

34:02.144 --> 34:04.778
When she married her fourth husband,
they built this house,

34:04.780 --> 34:06.680
and that's who he named it after.

34:06.682 --> 34:08.382
Her name was Rosa. They named it Rose Hall.

34:08.384 --> 34:12.286
Rosa Palmer died right
here in Rose Hall in 1790,

34:12.288 --> 34:15.822
at the age of 72, but she's not buried here.

34:17.927 --> 34:22.795
Now, right here I have the
burial records for Rosa Palmer.

34:22.797 --> 34:25.315
She's buried at the St. James Church,

34:25.317 --> 34:27.016
about nine miles from you.

34:30.606 --> 34:33.340
Now, the second woman...
she was actually named Annie Palmer,

34:33.342 --> 34:35.943
but the similarities end there.

34:35.945 --> 34:38.312
According to the author I spoke to,

34:38.313 --> 34:42.014
this is supposed to be the only
known image of Annie Palmer.

34:48.757 --> 34:50.674
You said she had daddy issues.

34:50.676 --> 34:52.025
Her father died young.

34:52.027 --> 34:53.694
She moved here in 1820.

34:53.696 --> 34:56.530
Her husband dies in 1827.

34:56.532 --> 35:00.167
Now, in 1846,
Annie Palmer died sick and broke

35:00.169 --> 35:03.270
on another part of the
island at the age of 34.

35:03.272 --> 35:05.272
Now, is that her buried outside there? No.

35:05.274 --> 35:07.441
I mean, I have another doc that says

35:07.443 --> 35:11.478
she's buried in the same
church cemetery as Rosa.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.981
I'm just shocked.

35:14.950 --> 35:17.317
It's a lot of information.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.053
The story's overwhelming.

35:20.055 --> 35:23.657
You can't change a legend.

35:23.659 --> 35:25.075
Let me ask you a question.
You saw the two women, right?

35:25.077 --> 35:26.193
Yes.

35:26.195 --> 35:29.830
Does this look like who you might've seen?

35:29.832 --> 35:33.700
It does look <i> similar</i>
to the needy lady.

35:35.304 --> 35:38.872
Obviously, there's a huge mystery here.

35:38.874 --> 35:44.244
And I don't think that anyone is
going to resolve this mystery.

35:44.246 --> 35:49.249
But from Steve's research that he presented,

35:49.251 --> 35:52.786
I need to just go with my gut.

35:52.788 --> 35:57.024
I think that this very strong,
independent woman

35:57.026 --> 35:59.659
is possibly Rosa Palmer.

35:59.661 --> 36:03.430
I think the male that's here is probably

36:03.432 --> 36:08.635
one of her former husbands
that she may have killed.

36:08.637 --> 36:15.308
As for the younger female that
I encountered, this female,

36:15.310 --> 36:20.914
possibly Annie Palmer because
she had father issues,

36:20.916 --> 36:24.851
and she is extraordinarily needy.

36:24.853 --> 36:27.554
Well,
I think we need to really take a close look

36:27.556 --> 36:29.222
at doing as much as we can

36:29.224 --> 36:31.658
in order to not provoke something

36:31.660 --> 36:33.276
that has the ability to be awful.

36:36.148 --> 36:40.767
One of the things that
I find very concerning

36:40.769 --> 36:44.638
is what I encountered in the backyard.

36:44.640 --> 36:46.440
And the interesting thing was

36:46.442 --> 36:49.476
that there were guardians of the dead.

36:51.280 --> 36:54.965
These things said to me to stay
back and not to come there.

36:55.984 --> 36:58.185
They're about 12 feet tall,

36:58.187 --> 37:02.923
black body, bizarre arms and legs.

37:02.925 --> 37:05.826
They're very odd-looking.

37:05.828 --> 37:08.995
So I did do a sketch of what I saw.

37:08.997 --> 37:10.831
I'm dying to see what
these things look like.

37:18.006 --> 37:21.508
Well, you weren't kidding
when you said this is weird.

37:21.510 --> 37:24.177
This is what you got in your backyard,
just so you know.

37:24.179 --> 37:25.846
Oh.

37:25.848 --> 37:27.581
They're horrific.

37:27.583 --> 37:32.285
They're capable, really,
of anything, including death.

37:49.005 --> 37:51.065
This is what you got in your backyard,
just so you know.

37:51.165 --> 37:52.831
Oh.

37:52.833 --> 37:54.566
They're horrific.

37:54.568 --> 37:59.271
They're capable, really,
of anything, including death.

38:07.681 --> 38:10.582
So,
what do we need to do to make it all stop?

38:10.584 --> 38:14.620
The guardians... they're making sure

38:14.622 --> 38:19.241
that nothing bad happens to the
dead that were unjustly killed.

38:20.861 --> 38:24.963
And if these dead people feel threatened,

38:24.965 --> 38:27.332
they would reach out to these guardians

38:27.334 --> 38:31.603
and allow them to protect them.

38:31.605 --> 38:34.122
All right, well, I got to ask,

38:34.124 --> 38:37.476
I mean, you think his nighttime shows here

38:37.478 --> 38:38.677
are causing a problem?

38:38.679 --> 38:40.579
Yeah, that's what I'm saying
is I'm nervous about that.

38:40.581 --> 38:42.948
Well, that makes me nervous, so...

38:42.950 --> 38:44.683
The picture that you just showed.

38:48.255 --> 38:50.822
Well, Michael,
you're a successful guy,

38:50.824 --> 38:54.493
and I'm sure you got that way
by tackling problems head on.

38:54.495 --> 38:57.329
And right now there's a problem here.

38:57.331 --> 39:00.365
So the big question is,
can you keep your father's legacy alive

39:00.367 --> 39:03.335
while ensuring the safety of
your employees, your guests,

39:03.337 --> 39:05.037
and your family?

39:05.039 --> 39:06.488
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

39:06.490 --> 39:07.456
and see what she can tell us.

39:10.511 --> 39:14.379
As far as the dead are concerned,

39:14.381 --> 39:16.548
I do believe that some of the reenactments

39:16.550 --> 39:18.617
probably need to cease.

39:18.619 --> 39:20.385
It is causing them stress.

39:20.387 --> 39:24.690
So I think that that needs to be curtailed.

39:24.692 --> 39:26.391
So we want to make them
as comfortable as possible

39:26.393 --> 39:28.961
until they're able to go on.

39:28.963 --> 39:32.598
But as far as the guardians are concerned,

39:32.600 --> 39:34.349
offerings need to be made.

39:35.769 --> 39:37.019
Maybe once a month,

39:37.021 --> 39:39.838
bringing flowers and putting them out there.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.708
While you're doing this,
all you're saying is,

39:42.710 --> 39:46.578
"I respect what you're doing. Thank you."

39:46.580 --> 39:48.297
That's it.

39:49.984 --> 39:52.684
Now, what do they do
about the two women you saw?

39:52.686 --> 39:55.921
Rosa Palmer, with her three husbands,

39:55.923 --> 39:59.358
bring in a medium to talk to her and say,
you know,

39:59.360 --> 40:03.195
"Look, let's do this nice.

40:03.197 --> 40:04.479
"I can help you.

40:04.481 --> 40:07.366
I can help guide you to
move on and this and this."

40:07.368 --> 40:08.767
I hope that goes well.

40:10.304 --> 40:13.438
All right, so now what about the
second one with daddy issues?

40:13.440 --> 40:20.012
Okay, so that person,
who could possibly be Annie Palmer,

40:20.014 --> 40:25.133
I think that she actually will
be the easiest person to go.

40:25.135 --> 40:26.485
She is looking for love.

40:26.487 --> 40:30.022
And I think that a medium
who could connect with her

40:30.024 --> 40:33.625
would be able to talk to her,
communicate with her

40:33.627 --> 40:35.827
and let her know that it's okay

40:35.829 --> 40:39.581
and that she'll be reunited with
those that she's looking for

40:39.583 --> 40:42.300
and has always been looking for and lost.

40:42.302 --> 40:44.786
The male is honestly going to be

40:44.788 --> 40:47.839
the most difficult person to remove.

40:47.841 --> 40:49.908
In order to remove him,

40:49.910 --> 40:56.331
you would need to have a
priest come and do an exorcism.

40:57.785 --> 40:59.084
He is not budging.

40:59.086 --> 41:01.453
But I always thought an exorcism

41:01.455 --> 41:04.423
was the removal of the devil from a person.

41:04.425 --> 41:07.359
An exorcism can be done

41:07.361 --> 41:12.831
when a dead person is <i>
refusing</i> to leave.

41:12.833 --> 41:15.400
He's going to have be forcefully,

41:15.402 --> 41:17.335
unfortunately, removed.

41:17.337 --> 41:22.507
Now, to keep your father's
legacy alive and to respect it,

41:22.509 --> 41:24.710
are you gonna at least do
what Amy tells you to do?

41:24.712 --> 41:27.796
We need to do that to protect people

41:27.798 --> 41:30.749
who are visiting at our invitation

41:30.751 --> 41:32.918
and our family and Dad's legacy.

41:32.920 --> 41:37.284
So if that's what it takes to
keep Rose Hall Great House,

41:37.384 --> 41:41.551
safe and alive... Then I think
of course we'll do that.

41:41.651 --> 41:44.759
I think, we don't have choice.

41:47.663 --> 41:51.087
Presenting offering to these creatures
shouldn't be taken lightly,

41:51.111 --> 41:53.111
as they pose a very serious danger.

41:53.135 --> 41:56.765
But I believe if Michael and
his mother follow my advice,

41:56.865 --> 41:59.816
the dead will be set free,
and his family's legacy

41:59.916 --> 42:01.916
can continue safely for
generations to come.
