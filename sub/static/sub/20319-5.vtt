00:37.249 --> 00:38.316
Hey.

00:38.383 --> 00:39.383
Hey.

00:39.451 --> 00:40.784
Thanks for meeting me.

00:41.852 --> 00:43.053
It's been a long day.

00:43.121 --> 00:46.490
Anything left in the tank?

00:46.557 --> 00:47.958
What you got?

00:48.526 --> 00:50.293
I need you to go to a bar.

00:53.898 --> 00:57.667
You know when you said try
someplace new, this wasn't

00:57.735 --> 00:59.535
what I was picturing.

00:59.603 --> 01:01.904
It's a cop bar...
what do you want?

01:01.972 --> 01:03.139
You want velvet ropes?

01:03.206 --> 01:05.675
I would settle
for air freshener.

01:05.743 --> 01:08.144
Last six months a
dedicated unit of IIB has

01:08.211 --> 01:12.547
been running a massive drug
investigation with Metro.

01:12.615 --> 01:16.484
Lots of big busts, bad guys
being taken off the street...

01:16.952 --> 01:18.553
I sense a 'but' coming.

01:18.621 --> 01:21.489
Yeah, recently the
busts have slowed down.

01:21.557 --> 01:24.026
Now some people say that
Metro's going soft, others

01:24.093 --> 01:27.428
think there is something
much more serious going on.

01:28.096 --> 01:31.098
I have been asked
to take a look.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.167
So McCluskey gave me
a new case today.

01:33.234 --> 01:34.702
Are you at least getting
paid for this one?

01:35.270 --> 01:36.937
It's not about the money.

01:37.005 --> 01:38.973
<i>Most of rumors have been
swirling around a couple</i>

01:39.041 --> 01:42.677
<i>of detectives from
Metro's anti-gang unit.</i>

01:43.244 --> 01:44.010
Follow my lead.

01:44.078 --> 01:45.845
Follow your what?

01:46.847 --> 01:51.317
<i>Ross Miller, fifteen-year vet
and his partner Scott O'Neil.</i>

01:51.385 --> 01:53.019
Ooh, nice shot.

01:53.087 --> 01:55.254
Me and my partner here,
we got the next game.

01:55.322 --> 01:56.956
Oh, we got us
some bangers.

01:57.024 --> 01:58.391
Hey fresh meat.

01:58.458 --> 01:59.758
Miller, right?

01:59.826 --> 02:01.894
Hey fellas,
do I know you?

02:03.129 --> 02:04.897
We are EMS, I think we
might have worked a case

02:04.964 --> 02:06.431
together last year.

02:06.499 --> 02:08.701
<i>Took it
in the lung... Parkdale.</i>

02:08.768 --> 02:10.435
<i>That's overtime
for that one.</i>

02:10.502 --> 02:13.238
What's that, that
was West End right?

02:13.306 --> 02:15.640
Yeah. Hey yeah, West End,
yes definitely.

02:15.708 --> 02:18.042
Right, it was Parkdale,
it was a stabbing.

02:18.110 --> 02:19.577
You mean the
Portuguese guy.

02:19.644 --> 02:21.378
You remember that Ross, he
was at the laundry mat...

02:21.446 --> 02:22.613
Took one in the chest?

02:22.681 --> 02:25.049
Yeah, that's right, collapsed lung.
Hey Toby this is...

02:25.117 --> 02:27.185
- Oz.
'Sup.  - What's goin' on Oz.

02:27.252 --> 02:29.420
Don't get too many of the
Band-Aid brigade in here.

02:29.487 --> 02:30.554
You guys want me to get
you another pitcher?

02:30.622 --> 02:32.756
- Yeah.
- Hell yeah.

02:32.824 --> 02:33.890
Okay.

02:36.494 --> 02:39.497
Cops and paramedics...

02:39.694 --> 02:41.497
we are like brothers.

02:41.965 --> 02:43.466
Yeah.

02:43.534 --> 02:45.001
Imagine how I feel.

02:56.279 --> 02:58.848
Yeah, just got lucky.

02:58.915 --> 03:00.382
I don't think I
like you guys.

03:00.450 --> 03:02.517
- There ya go.
- Nice.

03:02.585 --> 03:03.918
I got lucky, I got lucky.

03:03.986 --> 03:04.919
I think you gentlemen
have met my associate,

03:04.987 --> 03:06.087
Minnesota Fats...

03:06.155 --> 03:08.223
Not from
Minnesota, nor fat.

03:08.290 --> 03:09.657
Whoa...

03:09.725 --> 03:12.160
- The city gives you guy a pay...
- You guys robbed a bank? Look at that.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.033
Ponies were
good to me today.

03:20.101 --> 03:21.434
Oh the ponies.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.669
Why don't you guys get us
another round, all right?

03:22.737 --> 03:24.037
Sure.

03:24.105 --> 03:25.639
Scott and I have to
have a little shoptalk.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.840
Right.

03:26.908 --> 03:29.877
Shop talk, okay.

03:29.944 --> 03:32.980
Excuse me can we grab
another pitcher?

03:33.047 --> 03:34.547
You got it.

03:34.615 --> 03:38.417
Hey, what's going on?

03:38.985 --> 03:39.718
Nothing.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.588
Come on this is...
this is the IIB thing?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.824
This is your new case,
these cops with the

03:44.892 --> 03:46.425
massive wad of cash.

03:46.493 --> 03:49.262
You know it would be nice to
know this stuff ahead of time.

03:49.329 --> 03:52.164
I thought we would come in
and drink a little bit and

03:52.231 --> 03:53.665
then we would leave.

03:53.732 --> 03:55.834
Maybe make some lifelong
enemies while we're at it.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.369
Guys, I need
you, now! Come on.

03:58.437 --> 03:59.604
Okay... alright...

04:01.407 --> 04:02.941
All right, okay.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.445
Hey...

04:05.910 --> 04:07.445
Call 911.

04:10.015 --> 04:11.748
I need you to clear a path and
make sure EMS can get in here.

04:11.817 --> 04:13.217
Yes this is
Detective O'Neil...

04:17.010 --> 04:23.010
<font color="#FF8C00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="##FF8C00">for www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:26.017 --> 04:28.552
He's unresponsive, breathing
is shallow and irregular.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.654
He's got tachycardia,
BP is sinking.

04:30.722 --> 04:32.255
It's a good thing you
both were on the scene.

04:32.323 --> 04:33.891
One second he's fine,
the next second elevated

04:33.959 --> 04:35.526
pulse, seizures,
the whole thing.

04:35.594 --> 04:37.360
Okay he's crashing,
let's move it.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.567
Did not see that coming.

04:44.635 --> 04:46.369
Yeah, yeah, that
just happened.

04:46.436 --> 04:47.971
How is he?

04:48.038 --> 04:48.938
They're going to work
on him right now. I don't know.

04:49.006 --> 04:50.206
Just hang here.

04:50.273 --> 04:51.474
Scott, where is he?

04:51.542 --> 04:52.841
The Sgt. just took him inside.

04:52.909 --> 04:54.510
Sir, I'm Toby Logan,
I'm a paramedic.

04:54.577 --> 04:55.911
I was there at
the bar with him.

04:55.979 --> 04:57.045
Look you don't want to go
back there; just let the

04:57.113 --> 04:58.480
doctors do their thing.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.948
Yeah, yeah, you are right.

05:00.016 --> 05:02.017
It's just when it's one
of your own, you know.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.919
I know.

05:05.321 --> 05:08.223
Hey Scott, is there
anything else you can tell

05:08.224 --> 05:10.125
me about what happened?

05:18.867 --> 05:21.035
Like I said, he
just crumpled.

05:21.102 --> 05:22.375
Hey...

05:24.200 --> 05:26.875
You got to tell
them about the drugs.

05:28.943 --> 05:30.309
What drugs?

05:30.377 --> 05:32.679
Shop talk.

05:32.747 --> 05:36.149
The Dr. should
know about that.

05:36.216 --> 05:37.584
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

05:37.652 --> 05:39.586
Look your boy's hanging
on by a thread right now.

05:39.654 --> 05:41.820
If you don't
tell them I will.

05:41.888 --> 05:44.990
They're going to
find out eventually.

05:46.026 --> 05:48.127
<i>Code blue, ER 4.</i>

05:48.195 --> 05:52.164
<i>Code blue, ER 4.</i>

06:06.244 --> 06:08.512
Liv...

06:08.580 --> 06:11.282
Acute myocardial
infarction.

06:11.349 --> 06:14.318
The Coroner will figure
out what happened.

06:14.386 --> 06:17.521
I'm sorry Toby. You did
everything you could.

06:35.106 --> 06:36.106
Ms. Miller?

06:36.173 --> 06:37.407
Yes?

06:37.475 --> 06:41.243
Do you know something
about my husband?

06:41.311 --> 06:43.579
Dr. Fawcett will be out
to talk with you soon.

06:43.646 --> 06:46.415
What?

06:46.483 --> 06:47.849
No, no.

06:51.421 --> 06:54.322
It's okay, I'm right here.

07:03.198 --> 07:04.632
Oh man, shift starts in
five hours...

07:04.699 --> 07:06.367
I'm going to hit
one of the cots upstairs.

07:06.435 --> 07:09.370
Hey Oz, listen, what you
said earlier about you not

07:09.438 --> 07:12.172
filling you in when I'm
helping Michelle, I was wrong.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.207
Yeah you were.

07:14.275 --> 07:15.642
I volunteered
for this you didn't.

07:15.709 --> 07:16.843
Speaking of which... do
you know exactly what you

07:16.910 --> 07:18.245
volunteered for?

07:18.312 --> 07:20.747
I mean do you get a bonus
if you end up dead?

07:20.814 --> 07:23.350
This is not my
first rodeo.

07:23.417 --> 07:24.851
Toby this is
different, okay?

07:24.918 --> 07:26.685
These cops, they pick their
teeth with guys like us.

07:26.753 --> 07:29.488
I do not want to get lost
into an early grave.

07:29.556 --> 07:31.857
Right which is why I think
you should keep your day job.

07:31.924 --> 07:33.159
That's something you
might want to consider.

07:33.226 --> 07:35.594
Hey... got here
as fast as I could.

07:35.662 --> 07:36.795
Thanks for coming.

07:36.863 --> 07:38.096
It's been a hell
of a night for you.

07:38.165 --> 07:39.598
I was there too,
Sgt. McCluskey, you know.

07:39.666 --> 07:42.467
Could have been shot,
no big deal, right?

07:44.336 --> 07:46.504
I didn't realize
I hired a team.

07:46.572 --> 07:47.672
Don't worry, you didn't.

07:47.739 --> 07:49.040
You want to grab a tea?

07:49.107 --> 07:50.275
Yeah.

07:51.810 --> 07:54.912
So Ross Miller
didn't make it.

07:54.980 --> 07:58.649
Yeah, yeah.

07:58.716 --> 08:00.717
How you doing;
you doing okay?

08:00.785 --> 08:02.919
Sometimes you don't
want to be right.

08:04.722 --> 08:06.423
They said he OD'd.

08:06.491 --> 08:12.296
Yeah he was doing coke in the
bathroom before he collapsed.

08:12.363 --> 08:14.330
And his partner Scott
cleaned it up before he

08:14.398 --> 08:15.498
came and got us.

08:15.566 --> 08:16.599
Was he using too?

08:16.667 --> 08:18.234
I don't know. I don't know.

08:18.302 --> 08:20.336
All I got was that he was
cleaning it up like he was

08:20.404 --> 08:23.306
trying to protect Ross.

08:23.373 --> 08:26.642
Well it's not a stretch
to think that they were

08:26.710 --> 08:28.377
skimming coke
from their busts.

08:28.445 --> 08:30.878
What I need to know is if
it went any further than that.

08:30.946 --> 08:32.780
Ross was flashing
a lot of cash.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.381
What's a lot?

08:34.450 --> 08:38.785
Like a chunk of cash.

08:38.854 --> 08:41.188
I got a good
read off Ross.

08:41.256 --> 08:42.457
There's more.

08:42.525 --> 08:46.160
There's boxes of cash.

08:46.228 --> 08:50.698
This is not what
I wanted to hear.

08:50.765 --> 08:53.234
Welcome to my world.

08:53.301 --> 08:54.702
Yeah.

08:56.471 --> 09:00.374
There's a guy with gold
teeth and a diamond stud and

09:00.442 --> 09:02.642
a spinning eight ball, now I
don't know if that's code

09:02.710 --> 09:05.478
for crack or it's because
we were playing pool.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.490
Well, well, well,
look who's on time.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.524
Bright eyed and bushy
tailed too sir.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.693
Looks like you two have
had a rough night.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.395
Oh you heard about that?

09:23.463 --> 09:26.298
Oh yeah, from the Metro
Sgt. sitting in my office.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.067
Wants a private
meeting with you two.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.204
Hey.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.106
Detective Matt Collins
from the hospital, remember?

09:36.174 --> 09:37.675
Yeah, I remember,
Toby Logan.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.344
Yeah, thanks for
taking the time.

09:40.412 --> 09:43.314
I know you did your best to save
Ross, we all appreciate it.

09:43.382 --> 09:45.048
His partner Scott O'Neil
says he and Ross were

09:45.116 --> 09:47.017
having drinks with you
two when it happened.

09:47.085 --> 09:48.586
That's right, yeah.

09:48.654 --> 09:49.654
Scott says after Ross went
to the can and didn't come

09:49.721 --> 09:52.589
back he went to find him.

09:52.657 --> 09:54.157
That's not exactly...

09:54.224 --> 09:57.627
Look, I'm not going to pretend
Ross didn't have his problems.

09:57.695 --> 09:59.329
It's not like the tox screen
is going to be a secret.

09:59.397 --> 10:02.832
It's just I've lost one
good cop, I don't want to

10:02.900 --> 10:04.701
lose another.

10:06.503 --> 10:07.770
Sir, we can only tell
you what happened.

10:07.837 --> 10:09.938
They both went to the
bathroom together.

10:10.006 --> 10:13.309
Is that how you
remember it Mr. Bay?

10:13.376 --> 10:18.947
Yeah they went to 'talk shop'
and by the time we got in

10:19.015 --> 10:21.016
there someone had tidied up.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.718
It's not exactly
rocket surgery.

10:26.021 --> 10:31.826
I don't think I'm getting
through to you guys.

10:31.893 --> 10:34.562
These are men in uniform
just like you, who put it

10:34.630 --> 10:35.963
all on the line every day.

10:36.031 --> 10:37.398
One is dead and you want
to destroy another for

10:37.466 --> 10:40.900
some dumb indiscretion?

10:40.968 --> 10:43.570
You saw things
a certain way.

10:43.638 --> 10:47.006
Maybe it would behoove you to think
about whether you might be mistaken.

10:56.315 --> 10:58.050
The boys in anti-gang unit
are going to close ranks,

10:58.117 --> 10:59.752
you can bank on it.

10:59.820 --> 11:03.656
Yeah this is what you call your
basic thankless task, right?

11:03.724 --> 11:06.726
No surprise they gave
this one to the blond.

11:06.793 --> 11:08.427
I know you're not looking
for thanks but you may be

11:08.495 --> 11:10.429
looking for trouble.

11:10.497 --> 11:12.364
Am I supposed to be reading
between the lines here?

11:12.431 --> 11:14.799
Rookie cop to IIB Sgt,
in under ten years.

11:14.868 --> 11:17.702
Correct me if I am wrong but
isn't that a land speed record.

11:17.770 --> 11:22.640
Ah, ah, that's actually
[inaudible], thank you.

11:22.708 --> 11:25.043
And your point?

11:25.111 --> 11:28.145
You didn't get here by
making the wrong choices.

11:28.213 --> 11:30.714
Like putting fellow
officers under the microscope.

11:30.782 --> 11:33.751
All I'm saying is sometimes
when you're right,

11:33.818 --> 11:35.686
you're wrong...
and vice versa.

11:35.754 --> 11:37.121
Well thank you
for the homily.

11:37.189 --> 11:38.722
You make a corruption
charge, whether it sticks

11:38.790 --> 11:40.591
or not, an officer is
going to be affected,

11:40.658 --> 11:41.825
maybe permanently.

11:41.894 --> 11:43.894
Yeah I know that;
happened to my dad.

11:47.265 --> 11:48.698
Yeah?

11:50.434 --> 11:53.436
Do you want me to make some
popcorn, slip in a movie?

11:53.504 --> 11:55.305
I wasn't talking to you.

11:55.373 --> 11:57.440
Took two hours, two.

11:59.175 --> 12:00.542
Where's the ambulance?

12:00.610 --> 12:02.378
Wait a minute, did you
leave the keys in it... ?

12:02.445 --> 12:03.379
You were driving.

12:03.446 --> 12:05.180
So it's stolen?

12:05.248 --> 12:06.315
Who'd steal an ambulance?

12:06.320 --> 12:07.582
Someone who is very
accident-prone or something.

12:07.583 --> 12:10.419
Looking for something?

12:10.486 --> 12:14.023
Hey guys, remember me?

12:14.090 --> 12:15.423
Where's our ambulance?

12:15.490 --> 12:17.858
Oh I had it towed; it was
blocking a fire lane.

12:17.927 --> 12:19.794
What fire lane; there's
no fire lane here?

12:19.861 --> 12:23.298
You can read all about that
in the report, how' that.

12:23.365 --> 12:24.399
Hey Oz, call [inaudible]
tell him what's going on.

12:24.466 --> 12:25.566
I got to take
care of this.

12:25.634 --> 12:26.667
I know you're
upset about Ross.

12:26.735 --> 12:27.701
Ross?

12:27.769 --> 12:29.070
Yeah.

12:29.138 --> 12:32.306
It's Detective Miller, a
police officer who's dead

12:32.373 --> 12:34.174
and you want to rake his
family over the coals?

12:34.242 --> 12:37.477
They have a right to
the truth don't they?

12:37.545 --> 12:42.215
You're so far above your pay
grade man, you have no idea.

12:42.283 --> 12:43.850
Well you're right; my job
isn't nearly as lucrative

12:43.918 --> 12:45.419
as yours.

12:47.787 --> 12:51.590
Whoa, Whoa,
Whoa, Whoa...

12:51.658 --> 12:53.025
...that was a
mistake Logan...

12:53.093 --> 12:56.162
If I were you I'd keep my
eye on the eight-ball.

12:56.229 --> 12:59.865
<i>Eight ball
came through for us again.</i>

12:59.933 --> 13:01.733
Come here, come here.

13:01.801 --> 13:03.468
Hands behind our back.

13:03.535 --> 13:06.904
- Spread 'em     - Come on!
Come on.

13:06.973 --> 13:08.273
Is this really
necessary officer.

13:08.341 --> 13:09.707
Take a walk.

13:14.780 --> 13:16.481
How you doing?

13:16.548 --> 13:18.483
Can't complain.

13:18.550 --> 13:20.017
I'm sure I don't have to
tell you this could go

13:20.085 --> 13:24.754
down very hard for you;
assaulting a police officer.

13:24.822 --> 13:29.226
He towed our ambulance;
there was no reason for that.

13:29.294 --> 13:32.963
You know Scott's a good man;
he's good police.

13:33.031 --> 13:35.331
If you lose a partner the way
he did, he's only human...

13:35.399 --> 13:38.834
I say I sit him down, talk
to him and you pretend

13:38.902 --> 13:41.070
this never happened.

13:41.138 --> 13:42.938
The list of things that
never happened seems to be

13:43.007 --> 13:46.042
getting bigger.

13:46.110 --> 13:47.276
If I were you I'd think
long and hard about where

13:47.344 --> 13:51.413
you could wind up.

13:51.481 --> 13:54.349
Sgt McCluskey,
IIB, he's with me.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.719
Really?

13:57.786 --> 13:59.754
Paramedics see
a lot I guess.

13:59.822 --> 14:02.524
Maybe so much
they get confused.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.293
And just so you know Sgt.
I'll stand by my people

14:05.361 --> 14:09.897
all day long,
is that clear?

14:09.964 --> 14:12.933
So clear I can see
right through it.

14:13.001 --> 14:14.135
Unbelievable.

14:14.202 --> 14:16.237
Yeah.

14:16.304 --> 14:18.639
Think things are tense
now, I'm about to share

14:18.706 --> 14:21.808
Ross's toxicology
report with these guys.

14:23.110 --> 14:24.444
What, there
was no cocaine?

14:24.512 --> 14:25.811
No, there was plenty of
that but what killed him

14:25.879 --> 14:27.880
was a lethal
dose of cyanide.

14:27.948 --> 14:29.982
So now we're not just
investigating cops,

14:30.051 --> 14:33.353
we're investigating
a cop murder.

14:33.421 --> 14:34.554
Yeah.

14:41.306 --> 14:42.706
So I'm pretty sure
eight-ball is the guy with

14:42.774 --> 14:44.308
the gold tooth.

14:44.376 --> 14:45.977
He has something to
do with the cocaine.

14:46.044 --> 14:48.246
So we get him maybe we
can find out how deep

14:48.313 --> 14:51.082
the cancer inside the
anti-gang unit really is.

14:51.149 --> 14:52.649
Well whoever killed Ross
had to be able to get

14:52.717 --> 14:55.652
close enough to his
stash to taint it.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.988
Someone who's afraid
Ross's recklessness would

14:58.055 --> 14:59.923
bring them down too.

14:59.991 --> 15:02.458
Or someone like a dealer who
is being pressured by the cops.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.294
Okay I'm going to get
Dev putting a face

15:04.362 --> 15:06.396
to this eight-ball.

15:06.463 --> 15:08.198
Look I wish I could say
the heat was off, but

15:08.266 --> 15:09.532
I have a feeling you're
going to get leaned on

15:09.600 --> 15:11.667
even harder before
this is over.

15:11.735 --> 15:12.968
Well the same
goes for you.

15:13.536 --> 15:15.038
Yeah.

15:16.606 --> 15:19.308
I can't afford to be
wrong on this one.

15:38.227 --> 15:40.261
Sorry there bud.

15:51.172 --> 15:53.073
What are you trying to do?
Blow my cover?

15:53.141 --> 15:55.242
Is there anything coming back
on who might have done Ross?

15:55.310 --> 15:56.743
No.

15:56.811 --> 15:58.178
If anyone knows anything
they're not saying nothing.

15:58.246 --> 15:59.379
Look somebody
got to his coke.

15:59.447 --> 16:00.679
He took a hot shot.

16:00.747 --> 16:02.081
You got to know where
he got his drugs.

16:02.149 --> 16:05.451
Look Matt, I didn't ask if
he didn't want tell, right?

16:05.518 --> 16:07.420
I'm working on it.

16:07.487 --> 16:09.521
Is there something
you're not telling me?

16:09.589 --> 16:12.191
Is there something
you're not telling me?

16:12.259 --> 16:14.327
I'm cutting you
guys a lot of slack.

16:14.394 --> 16:16.361
I didn't listen to the trash
talk, I didn't ask questions.

16:16.429 --> 16:18.896
Anything coming back
to bite me on the ass?

16:18.965 --> 16:22.267
Sir, I just want to find
out who's involved.

16:22.335 --> 16:24.101
Then you do that, but
everything's by the book right?

16:24.110 --> 16:25.437
you're not going off
half cocked.

16:25.504 --> 16:27.805
By the book Sarge,
like you said.

16:35.013 --> 16:36.046
Whoa, jeez...

16:36.114 --> 16:37.547
Whoa what?
What's going on?

16:37.615 --> 16:38.882
I saw a cop car.

16:38.950 --> 16:40.884
Not every cop in the
city is after us.

16:40.952 --> 16:42.987
Yeah just the loose
cannons with crazy eyes

16:43.054 --> 16:45.456
and bulging neck veins.

16:45.523 --> 16:47.757
I don't want to poop on your
parade here but I'm starting

16:47.825 --> 16:50.126
to think this whole IIB
thing was a bit mistake.

16:50.194 --> 16:52.028
If it's a mistake
it's my mistake.

16:52.096 --> 16:54.163
Yeah, but it has consequences
for other people.

16:54.231 --> 16:56.032
I'm not just talking about
me, even though I will be

16:56.100 --> 16:58.201
reliving that telephone
conversation with Ryder about

16:58.268 --> 17:00.736
the ambulance towing for the
rest of my life, thank you.

17:00.804 --> 17:04.205
Okay, I didn't mean to get
anyone involved in this.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.740
Toby if you want to fight
crime, get a badge and a

17:05.808 --> 17:06.875
gun and fight crime.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.675
But is that who you are?

17:16.085 --> 17:18.020
Last year the anti-gang
unit did a sweep of the

17:18.087 --> 17:19.454
downtown east side.

17:19.521 --> 17:21.989
This is one of the
guys they arrested.

17:22.057 --> 17:26.527
He goes by the name of Erran Balamani,
aka eight-ball.

17:26.594 --> 17:28.194
That's original.

17:28.262 --> 17:30.231
Possession, two counts,
possession with intent,

17:30.298 --> 17:31.565
one count.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.766
All the charges got
dropped before they made

17:32.834 --> 17:34.301
their way to court.

17:34.369 --> 17:36.602
I'm going to give you one
wild guess who made the bust?

17:36.670 --> 17:38.905
Scott O'Neil
and Ross Miller.

17:38.972 --> 17:40.440
Boom.

17:40.508 --> 17:41.741
And here's where it starts
to get interesting.

17:41.808 --> 17:42.775
We've been tracking this
eight-ball character...

17:42.843 --> 17:44.144
Who has, IIB?

17:44.211 --> 17:45.611
Immigration unit.

17:45.679 --> 17:46.913
His family is from Sri Lanka
with some serious

17:46.980 --> 17:49.516
ties to the Tamil Tigers
and the hard core members

17:49.583 --> 17:51.751
they have this tradition;
they carry a vial of cyanide

17:51.818 --> 17:54.453
around their neck in case
they ever get captured.

17:54.521 --> 17:56.121
Well I'll be damned.

18:00.693 --> 18:05.431
Hey... uh, I saw you
the other day, right?

18:05.498 --> 18:08.099
I'm Toby.

18:11.803 --> 18:14.472
Sorry about your loss.

18:14.540 --> 18:16.974
My mom's getting
dad's things.

18:17.042 --> 18:18.842
I couldn't go
back in there.

18:18.910 --> 18:21.079
Can't imagine the pain
of losing your father.

18:21.146 --> 18:23.647
<i>...around the house.</i>

18:23.715 --> 18:24.747
<i>I've had enough of this.</i>

18:24.815 --> 18:26.550
<i>Let go...</i>

18:27.718 --> 18:30.220
You see this every
day don't you?

18:30.288 --> 18:34.124
I do; too many days.

18:35.293 --> 18:40.296
How do people do it?
Like get through it?

18:40.363 --> 18:45.968
They just do.
It's life one day at a time.

18:46.035 --> 18:47.936
Yeah.

18:59.381 --> 19:02.717
Eight-ball, why don't
we have a little chat?

19:02.784 --> 19:06.187
You guys can
go for a walk.

19:07.689 --> 19:08.923
What?

19:08.991 --> 19:10.091
You know what?

19:10.159 --> 19:12.259
No, I don't.

19:12.327 --> 19:14.794
Why don't you tell
me about the tigers?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.062
Give me a break.

19:16.131 --> 19:17.297
That's old world stuff.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.599
I ain't got nothing
to do with it.

19:18.666 --> 19:20.167
Yeah, you don't have an
uncle in the tigers,

19:20.235 --> 19:21.968
carries some cyanide
around his neck.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.170
Cyanide?

19:23.238 --> 19:25.572
What are you smoking?

19:25.640 --> 19:26.973
Tell me about the cops.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.407
You're the first
two I've met.

19:28.475 --> 19:30.943
How about I go tell your
crew back there how you

19:31.011 --> 19:32.445
cut a deal with two cops
to get those possession

19:32.513 --> 19:33.979
charges dropped.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.914
Listen if you think I'm
some kind of player I'm not.

19:35.982 --> 19:37.916
Anti-gang unit, they cut
you loose; you supplied

19:37.984 --> 19:39.385
them with product.

19:39.453 --> 19:41.754
No, no, listen. I didn't
supply them with anything.

19:41.821 --> 19:43.623
He took what he wanted.

19:43.690 --> 19:45.624
You supplied them coke.

19:45.691 --> 19:47.592
No, just information.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.027
I keep my ears open.

19:49.094 --> 19:50.428
If someone's pushing
weight I let them know.

19:50.496 --> 19:51.963
And you do that for
what; for charity?

19:52.031 --> 19:53.532
I get a cut.

19:53.599 --> 19:55.833
Yeah, cash or blow?

19:55.901 --> 19:57.869
Oh, okay, both.

19:57.936 --> 20:01.272
So what happened?

20:01.339 --> 20:03.274
Ross cut you loose, maybe
you wanted a bigger piece?

20:03.341 --> 20:07.444
Ross? I didn't
deal with Ross.

20:07.512 --> 20:09.346
It was Scott.

20:09.414 --> 20:12.849
Him and I, we never
had a problem.

20:16.887 --> 20:18.521
Scott.

20:19.623 --> 20:20.723
Scott.

20:36.499 --> 20:38.100
You all right?

20:38.168 --> 20:40.201
- Just...
- Excuse me.

20:40.269 --> 20:41.602
Just sit down.

20:41.670 --> 20:45.439
Thank you.

20:45.507 --> 20:48.375
I'll get you some water.

20:53.047 --> 20:58.284
You're the paramedic, the one
who was there when it happened?

20:58.352 --> 20:59.986
Yeah, one of them.
There was two of us.

21:00.053 --> 21:03.723
He was still
alive with you.

21:03.791 --> 21:07.760
Yeah, just barely lucid.

21:10.464 --> 21:14.633
<i>Thank god it's over.</i>

21:17.336 --> 21:21.406
I was nineteen
when we married.

21:21.474 --> 21:24.676
We were just kids.

21:24.744 --> 21:27.880
Being a cop isn't easy;
it changes people,

21:27.947 --> 21:30.882
makes them do things
you wouldn't expect.

21:36.788 --> 21:38.789
<i>Did you think I
wouldn't find out?</i>

21:42.761 --> 21:46.897
I used to think people
could change;

21:46.964 --> 21:50.166
I don't anymore.

21:50.234 --> 21:53.136
Thank you.

22:07.450 --> 22:10.318
You said that eight-ball
has access to cyanide.

22:10.386 --> 22:13.221
What if he's not the killer,
but the killer got the

22:13.289 --> 22:15.057
cyanide from eight-ball.

22:15.124 --> 22:17.659
Someone could have
switched it with Ross's stash.

22:17.726 --> 22:20.828
Someone like Scott?

22:20.896 --> 22:23.364
Or Emily.

22:23.432 --> 22:27.569
The wife in an
abusive marriage...

22:27.636 --> 22:30.504
having an affair with some
mystery man, which could

22:30.573 --> 22:31.906
also be Scott.

22:31.974 --> 22:35.408
Well she did turn to him
right after she heard.

22:35.476 --> 22:38.946
We had an authorized tap
on Emily's telephone.

22:39.013 --> 22:42.049
Here's a call from
Scott late last night.

22:43.985 --> 22:46.286
<i>I know Emily, I know, I know,
it's got to be hell for you.</i>

22:46.353 --> 22:47.588
<i>It's going to get
better believe me.</i>

22:47.655 --> 22:49.421
<i>It hasn't even
sunk in yet.</i>

22:49.489 --> 22:51.557
<i>I'll come by, I'll
take care of things.</i>

22:51.625 --> 22:52.858
<i>You got enough
to worry about.</i>

22:52.926 --> 22:54.193
He's been in there
for forty minutes.

22:55.295 --> 22:58.464
[inaudible] temperature.

22:58.531 --> 22:59.465
Ear bud...

22:59.532 --> 23:01.133
Oh thanks.

23:06.839 --> 23:08.740
Nice to see you again.

23:08.808 --> 23:12.176
Listen, Sarge I'm more
than happy to answer any

23:12.244 --> 23:13.612
questions you might
have about Ross.

23:13.679 --> 23:14.846
I'd just like to
get back to work.

23:14.914 --> 23:17.983
What do you know
about eight-ball?

23:18.050 --> 23:21.251
You try to sink it last?

23:21.319 --> 23:23.988
We know he was a paid
informant for you guys;

23:24.055 --> 23:28.225
gave you intel on a
bunch of drug busts.

23:28.292 --> 23:30.527
You accusing us
of doing our job?

23:30.595 --> 23:33.530
This is your arrest
records for the last year;

23:33.598 --> 23:38.768
carjacking, turf wars,
east end sweeps, drug busts...

23:38.836 --> 23:40.536
so what's missing here?

23:40.604 --> 23:41.570
You tell me?

23:41.639 --> 23:42.972
Money.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.641
Dealers always carry lots
of it but you guys never

23:44.708 --> 23:46.375
seem to recover much.

23:46.443 --> 23:49.512
<i>I don't risk
my ass for a cop's salary.</i>

23:49.579 --> 23:51.648
Don't you think I don't
know what it's like

23:51.715 --> 23:55.617
surrounded by these low life
criminals every single day?

23:55.685 --> 23:59.755
They all have more money than
you; bigger houses, nicer cars.

23:59.822 --> 24:04.225
So you take a little cash;
who's going to know?

24:04.293 --> 24:09.897
Sarge, we took the same
interrogation course.

24:09.965 --> 24:13.000
Of course I didn't have
the big Ivy League education.

24:13.068 --> 24:14.769
It must be nice to have
everything handed to you.

24:14.836 --> 24:16.170
How old are you?

24:16.237 --> 24:17.437
Eight-ball said you were
skimming the cream off

24:17.505 --> 24:19.173
busts from his intel.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.841
The man is a drug dealer.

24:20.909 --> 24:22.276
He'll tell you he craps
gold bricks if he thinks

24:22.343 --> 24:23.811
it will help him out.

24:23.879 --> 24:27.513
Come on, a cash
operation...

24:27.581 --> 24:30.750
...but something threatened
all of that, right?

24:32.452 --> 24:33.887
<i>I told him
his drug problem was going</i>

24:33.954 --> 24:36.556
<i>to get us both killed,
he wouldn't listen.</i>

24:36.623 --> 24:39.125
They were arguing
over Ross's drug use.

24:39.193 --> 24:43.628
What was it; Ross's coke
problem, maybe you two argued?

24:43.697 --> 24:44.763
We argued...

24:44.831 --> 24:46.699
look is this your
investigation?

24:46.766 --> 24:47.900
Why are you
covering for him?

24:47.967 --> 24:49.134
Why am I covering for him?

24:49.202 --> 24:51.103
He was my partner.

24:51.171 --> 24:53.038
Do you know
what that means?

24:53.106 --> 24:54.372
He would have laid
down his life for me.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.507
Oh I don't doubt that.

24:55.575 --> 24:56.908
That was his job.

24:56.975 --> 24:58.710
Your job is to find out
who slipped him that hot

24:58.777 --> 25:02.747
shot not try to pin
it on another cop.

25:02.815 --> 25:03.881
If you have any more
questions you go through

25:03.949 --> 25:06.017
the Union lawyer, right.

25:06.085 --> 25:10.521
Actually I do
have one more.

25:11.456 --> 25:14.591
Were you sleeping with
your partner's wife?

25:14.658 --> 25:19.429
Word is someone was.

25:23.868 --> 25:25.401
That's nice, real nice.

25:25.469 --> 25:26.669
You want to see our reactions
when we saw each other?

25:26.738 --> 25:29.972
You give me way
too much credit.

25:31.241 --> 25:35.111
Just answer the questions
Emily; you got nothing to hide.

25:36.312 --> 25:37.747
I'll be right there.

26:03.972 --> 26:06.573
I'm not sure I can
be of much help.

26:06.641 --> 26:09.843
Ross kept that side of
his life pretty private.

26:09.911 --> 26:11.645
It's a tough unit
to be married into.

26:11.712 --> 26:16.816
He tried not to bring it home
but you know how it is.

26:16.884 --> 26:18.384
Cop's got to keep their
cool right, never let them

26:18.451 --> 26:22.188
see you sweat.

26:22.256 --> 26:27.026
All that frustration, it's
got to come out somewhere.

26:31.098 --> 26:34.666
Ross got violent with her.

26:37.069 --> 26:41.739
Emily... he hit you,
didn't he?

26:41.808 --> 26:43.809
He wasn't himself
when he...

26:43.876 --> 26:46.011
When he used.

26:46.078 --> 26:47.813
Yeah.

26:47.880 --> 26:49.746
And who are you
going to tell?

26:49.815 --> 26:51.982
Your husband's a cop.

26:52.050 --> 26:53.650
Every day you...

26:53.718 --> 26:58.122
you think it's going to be
different but it never is.

27:01.459 --> 27:02.526
<i>It's not what
it looks like.</i>

27:02.593 --> 27:04.061
OH, it's not what
it looks like?

27:04.129 --> 27:07.030
Daughter caught him using?

27:07.097 --> 27:10.399
Did Jan ever
see him using?

27:10.467 --> 27:12.335
Well that was the deal
breaker, I mean I couldn't

27:12.402 --> 27:14.570
pretend anymore.

27:14.638 --> 27:19.943
Ross moved out to a
hotel a week later.

27:20.910 --> 27:22.544
Did he ever get
violent with her?

27:22.611 --> 27:23.946
No.

27:24.013 --> 27:27.149
Thank god, I would never
have forgiven him.

27:27.217 --> 27:28.750
But she was what he did
to you and that must have

27:28.818 --> 27:30.986
been tough.

27:31.054 --> 27:32.487
You know you put up with
it because you feel like

27:32.555 --> 27:36.158
you don't have any other
choice but then maybe one

27:36.226 --> 27:39.694
day you see a way out.

27:49.472 --> 27:51.673
I think I'd like to go now.

27:51.741 --> 27:53.241
I know who the lover is.

27:54.308 --> 27:55.909
Okay let's say
Toby's right,

27:55.977 --> 27:58.579
Emily is having an affair
with Ross's boss, Matt.

27:58.646 --> 28:00.814
Ross finds out,
gets rough.

28:00.882 --> 28:02.850
Emily decides to finally
fight back, she knew where

28:02.917 --> 28:04.284
he kept his drugs.

28:04.352 --> 28:05.719
She just needs to get
her hands on cyanide.

28:05.787 --> 28:07.254
Which is easy enough to
do; it's just pesticides

28:07.321 --> 28:08.889
and rat poison, right?

28:10.156 --> 28:12.157
I mean it could be
any one of them.

28:12.225 --> 28:15.027
Yeah?

28:15.095 --> 28:16.929
Yeah, okay, we'll
be right there.

28:16.997 --> 28:19.265
Come on let's go. Matt
and Scott found eight-ball.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.939
Really eight, my partner dies
and you thought I wouldn't

28:28.007 --> 28:29.408
come looking for you?

28:29.475 --> 28:30.609
I never gave him anything.

28:30.676 --> 28:31.743
Where do you think
it came from?

28:31.811 --> 28:33.344
Where did the
cyanide come from?

28:33.413 --> 28:34.479
It ain't from me.

28:34.547 --> 28:35.547
<i>Don't lie to us.</i>

28:35.615 --> 28:36.615
<i>I'm not lying to you.</i>

28:36.682 --> 28:37.582
<i>You're lying...
It's not from me.</i>

28:37.650 --> 28:39.618
<i>...fess up, fess up...</i>

28:39.685 --> 28:41.753
I know how this
is going to end.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.360
Here we go.

29:09.713 --> 29:13.150
Eight! Come on...

29:13.217 --> 29:14.850
come on, take it easy.

29:14.918 --> 29:16.485
Don't do anything
stupid man.

29:16.553 --> 29:19.021
We can work this
out. Trust me.

29:19.089 --> 29:21.257
Trust you?

29:29.833 --> 29:32.300
Dispatch this is Det Sgt. Collins
we have a suspect

29:32.368 --> 29:34.436
down, gunshot wounds.

29:34.503 --> 29:39.074
Alley off the northwest
corner of Gerrad and Ashdale.

29:53.021 --> 29:55.555
What the hell happened?

29:55.623 --> 29:57.157
He had a gun.

30:06.725 --> 30:09.027
Seriously, listen to these
emails between them.

30:09.094 --> 30:10.561
They got Ross in.

30:10.629 --> 30:11.796
It's never gonna happen,
I'm dropping you from the

30:11.864 --> 30:12.830
payroll effective
immediately, you are no

30:12.898 --> 30:14.999
longer a confidential
informant.

30:15.067 --> 30:16.367
Nobody drops eight-ball.

30:16.434 --> 30:20.270
Eight-ball's got the
drop on you bitch.

30:22.106 --> 30:23.707
How convenient that Metro
be releasing these

30:23.775 --> 30:25.341
from one dead
guy to another.

30:25.409 --> 30:27.944
Okay well how hard is it
to fake these emails?

30:28.012 --> 30:29.780
Give me a minute and
you'll get an email from

30:29.847 --> 30:32.915
Jimmy Hendrix inviting me
to a nice little luncheon.

30:32.983 --> 30:36.652
Well I know that I promised
but something's come up.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.821
Well there will be other
soccer games, right.

30:38.889 --> 30:40.756
So you can just...

30:40.824 --> 30:44.560
Can you please tell him
that I'm sorry and that...

30:58.208 --> 31:00.442
I thought you
might have left.

31:00.510 --> 31:03.111
Still working the
Metro cop homicide.

31:03.179 --> 31:05.946
What's there to work;
it's closed isn't it?

31:06.014 --> 31:08.782
Not from my end.

31:08.850 --> 31:12.587
I was copied on
that email string.

31:12.654 --> 31:16.156
Threats verified, cyanide
found in the dealers apartment;

31:16.225 --> 31:18.726
what more do
you want?

31:18.793 --> 31:22.395
How about a case that's not
wrapped up in a big shiny bow?

31:22.463 --> 31:25.332
You have everything you need
to put this thing to bed...

31:25.399 --> 31:28.201
Except for a signed
confession from one...

31:28.269 --> 31:32.205
...here it is, one Erram Balamani
aka eight-ball.

31:32.273 --> 31:35.675
Yeah well that would be
difficult because he's dead.

31:35.743 --> 31:38.176
Shot by a cop who is
also under suspicion.

31:38.245 --> 31:40.946
They guy pulled a gun.

31:41.013 --> 31:42.414
We are talking about a
drug dealer here and

31:42.482 --> 31:44.450
possible cop killer.

31:44.517 --> 31:46.084
Can we just drop the
charade for one minute and

31:46.152 --> 31:47.553
be honest with each other.

31:47.621 --> 31:49.087
Oh I'm sorry, because the
truth trumps everything

31:49.155 --> 31:50.656
doesn't it.

31:50.724 --> 31:52.391
Never mind that it destroys
our relationship with Metro.

31:52.459 --> 31:54.793
Whatever happened to that
gung-ho lawyer I met 8 years

31:54.861 --> 31:57.295
ago who said that the
system works and he's

31:57.363 --> 31:58.730
gonna prove it?

31:58.798 --> 32:01.900
That guy sends me fruit
baskets occasionally;

32:01.968 --> 32:03.835
every Christmas.

32:03.903 --> 32:05.703
Listen if they have issues
inside Metro they have

32:05.772 --> 32:07.639
special investigations
to handle it.

32:07.706 --> 32:09.907
Okay, well it doesn't
really come down to this.

32:09.975 --> 32:13.310
Since when is the greater
good a bad thing?

32:13.378 --> 32:15.445
Two standards of justice, right?
One for the cops

32:15.513 --> 32:16.781
and one for everyone else?

32:16.848 --> 32:18.082
I'm not saying that.

32:18.150 --> 32:19.750
Don't have to.

32:20.685 --> 32:23.988
You know my father was a
god in his precinct until

32:24.055 --> 32:27.190
he was accused of taking
ninety grand in cash from

32:27.258 --> 32:29.325
evidence lockup.

32:29.393 --> 32:32.595
He didn't do it;
it didn't matter.

32:40.637 --> 32:41.937
You know normally I have
no problems with the cops

32:42.005 --> 32:43.371
I run into on the job.

32:43.439 --> 32:44.673
These guys are the
exception, not the rule.

32:44.740 --> 32:45.841
So it's not just me.

32:45.909 --> 32:47.009
No, they're total...

32:47.076 --> 32:48.043
Jerks...

32:48.111 --> 32:50.212
- Yeah.
- I'm glad I caught you.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.281
- Hey sergeant.
- Hi Michelle.

32:52.348 --> 32:53.615
Do you have a minute?

32:53.683 --> 32:55.184
Yeah, I got a minute.

32:55.251 --> 32:58.519
You guys need to have a
little pow-wow, sure, great.

32:59.788 --> 33:01.189
Sorry.

33:03.859 --> 33:07.695
I'm being pressured to close
out the Ross Miller case.

33:07.762 --> 33:10.097
Well you got the perfect
scapegoat, is that it?

33:10.165 --> 33:11.398
If eight-ball wasn't dead
I would be arresting

33:11.466 --> 33:12.867
him right now.

33:12.935 --> 33:15.268
Yeah, I doubt that.

33:17.004 --> 33:19.005
Maybe you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

33:19.073 --> 33:20.473
Something tells me you
didn't come down here to

33:20.541 --> 33:24.177
tell me that the
case if over.

33:25.213 --> 33:28.248
Okay there is
something but...

33:28.316 --> 33:30.082
but I don't know if I
should have even brought

33:30.150 --> 33:31.516
you into this.

33:31.584 --> 33:32.751
Today it's eight-ball,
tomorrow it's some

33:32.819 --> 33:34.720
innocent person.

33:34.787 --> 33:36.588
Where's the line?

33:36.656 --> 33:37.756
What is it?

33:37.824 --> 33:38.858
You can still walk away.

33:38.925 --> 33:41.793
So can you.

33:41.862 --> 33:45.297
There's a wake for Ross
tomorrow at the Blue Goose;

33:45.365 --> 33:48.635
it's one last chance
to get to the truth.

33:50.802 --> 33:52.170
I'm in.

34:01.347 --> 34:03.881
So I've been asked to say
a few words about Ross.

34:03.948 --> 34:05.815
I've known Ross since...

34:05.884 --> 34:07.351
since he first
joined the force.

34:07.418 --> 34:08.851
Hey, want me to go
get the med kit?

34:08.920 --> 34:10.053
For what?

34:10.121 --> 34:11.154
For when we get
our asses kicked.

34:11.222 --> 34:12.155
Oh thought you
had my back.

34:12.223 --> 34:15.225
I do... in theory.

34:15.293 --> 34:20.462
Ross was a hell
of a cop...

34:20.530 --> 34:22.697
Hell of a friend.

34:22.766 --> 34:25.534
<i>What the
hell are they doing here?</i>

34:25.601 --> 34:27.569
You talk about loyalty...

34:27.637 --> 34:30.973
<i>Some nerve
coming here...</i>

34:31.041 --> 34:32.775
<i>...pair of rats.</i>

34:32.842 --> 34:34.409
...He'd be there for me.

34:34.476 --> 34:38.780
You never let a fellow
cop down, never.

34:38.847 --> 34:41.382
But he was a cutup too.

34:41.449 --> 34:42.951
Like that time he ordered
a case of champagne and

34:43.018 --> 34:44.552
billed it to
the inspector.

34:47.422 --> 34:51.091
Ross will be glad to know
that we got the bad guy.

34:51.159 --> 34:52.793
But he'd take more comfort
in knowing that Emily and

34:52.860 --> 34:55.799
Jan were looked after.

34:59.834 --> 35:01.640
So...

35:02.834 --> 35:05.640
one last time...

35:07.707 --> 35:08.975
to Ross.

35:09.043 --> 35:11.210
To Ross...

35:11.278 --> 35:14.780
We'll miss you buddy.

35:25.124 --> 35:27.859
Trying to decide whether
you boys are brave or stupid.

35:27.927 --> 35:31.463
Is it strictly an
either or situation?

35:31.530 --> 35:33.531
We're just paying
our respects.

35:33.599 --> 35:36.401
Well you had your
chance for that.

35:54.418 --> 35:57.387
Logan...

35:57.455 --> 36:04.461
...listen the thing between
us, I was out of line.

36:04.528 --> 36:07.930
It's okay I get
it, I get it.

36:07.999 --> 36:11.600
I'd do the same
thing for my partner.

36:11.667 --> 36:13.902
Look whatever Ross's
secrets were it's not

36:13.970 --> 36:18.007
worth digging
up right now.

36:18.074 --> 36:20.575
Though I here IIB is going
to be looking through his

36:20.643 --> 36:23.879
house tomorrow morning.

36:33.890 --> 36:36.290
Anyways...
no hard feelings.

36:36.358 --> 36:38.259
No.

36:41.296 --> 36:43.864
We should probably
get out of here.

36:43.932 --> 36:45.365
That we do.

36:45.433 --> 36:47.167
- Let's hope he took the bait.
- Or else this is going to be

36:47.235 --> 36:49.503
the end of your very
short career at IIB...

36:49.571 --> 36:52.272
or worse.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.431
What the hell
are you doing there?

37:38.499 --> 37:40.834
I followed Scott here,
he's looking for the money.

37:40.902 --> 37:43.136
You know that; of
course you know that.

37:43.204 --> 37:45.338
Okay don't do anything
until I get there.

37:45.406 --> 37:47.207
I'll be there
in ten minutes.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.424
This isn't good.

38:20.639 --> 38:21.706
Scott!

38:21.773 --> 38:23.073
What hell's going on?

38:23.141 --> 38:24.942
Close enough Sarge,
that's close enough.

38:25.009 --> 38:26.143
Emily get out of here now.

38:26.211 --> 38:29.112
No, no, no.

38:29.180 --> 38:31.581
Nobody's going anywhere.

38:31.649 --> 38:35.385
Okay Scottie, this is bad.

38:35.453 --> 38:38.322
Ross is dead; you're standing
here with all this cash.

38:38.389 --> 38:43.860
And look at you Sarge, standing
here, with a dead cop's wife.

38:43.927 --> 38:45.728
I know about the affair.

38:45.795 --> 38:48.130
Never mind that;
put the gun down.

38:48.198 --> 38:49.232
Scott please.

38:49.299 --> 38:50.299
You stay out of this.

38:50.367 --> 38:53.069
Hey, hey, hey...
hey!

38:53.136 --> 38:54.536
There's a way out of this.

38:54.604 --> 38:59.774
You come clean we'll put
all this behind you.

38:59.842 --> 39:02.510
There's no way
out; look at this.

39:02.578 --> 39:03.678
You're going
to roll on me.

39:03.746 --> 39:05.446
It's over okay.
Don't lie to me.

39:05.514 --> 39:07.515
No, no, I'm on your side.

39:07.583 --> 39:08.649
Listen to me;
I'm on your...

39:08.717 --> 39:10.951
Do not lie to me, Sarge!

39:11.019 --> 39:14.321
Look you still wear the
badge; that means something.

39:14.389 --> 39:15.990
You know what that means?

39:16.057 --> 39:19.193
It means we earned this.

39:19.261 --> 39:21.728
Ross and me, this
is our money.

39:21.796 --> 39:26.566
We earned this risking our
lives for years for what!

39:26.634 --> 39:28.101
I understand, just
give me the gun.

39:28.168 --> 39:31.004
You know what I'm talking
about Sarge, you know I'm right.

39:31.071 --> 39:33.306
Look for the love of God
Scott, we haven't even

39:33.374 --> 39:36.175
buried Ross yet.

39:41.415 --> 39:43.081
Scott went in
through the back.

39:43.149 --> 39:44.549
Matt and Emily
just showed up.

39:48.321 --> 39:49.521
Oh God...

39:50.790 --> 39:54.159
Oh my God Matt!

39:54.227 --> 39:57.695
Oh what have
you done Scott?

39:57.763 --> 40:01.165
Oh, oh...

40:01.233 --> 40:03.067
Drop the weapon
Scott; drop it!

40:04.369 --> 40:07.871
It's over.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.373
Do not move!

40:10.208 --> 40:12.209
Do not move!

40:12.277 --> 40:14.211
You gotta let me do something
or he's going to bleed out.

40:16.213 --> 40:20.516
Come on Scott.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.052
Scott you can't do this.

40:22.119 --> 40:23.886
Scott do the right thing.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.388
Let me help him.

40:25.456 --> 40:28.191
I just wanted to...

40:28.259 --> 40:30.460
...we were good cops.

40:30.527 --> 40:31.793
<i>You got
to cut me loose man;</i>

40:31.861 --> 40:34.663
<i>I'm too far gone,
save yourself.</i>

40:35.932 --> 40:39.701
You were a good friend,
you did what you could but

40:39.769 --> 40:40.702
he was too far gone.

40:40.770 --> 40:42.938
But not you.

40:43.006 --> 40:44.873
You can save yourself.

40:44.941 --> 40:47.475
That's what Ross
wanted you to do.

40:53.882 --> 40:55.549
Go ahead.

40:55.617 --> 40:56.917
Hey Matt, Matt...

40:56.986 --> 40:59.420
look at me, look at me.

40:59.488 --> 41:02.656
Keep talking to him,
keep him conscious.

41:02.724 --> 41:03.857
Matt, you're going
to be fine,

41:03.924 --> 41:05.125
we're going to be fine.

41:05.193 --> 41:07.527
Just keep breathing,
stay conscious.

41:10.398 --> 41:11.664
All right...

41:16.537 --> 41:18.205
You're doing good;
you're doing great.

41:18.272 --> 41:20.239
You're doing good Matt.

41:25.312 --> 41:27.713
You made the right choice.

41:51.636 --> 41:52.602
Hey...

41:53.270 --> 41:54.204
Hey.

41:54.272 --> 41:56.907
So I just spoke with our
legal liaison to the Crown.

41:56.974 --> 41:59.843
Scott's lawyers are already
suggesting a plea bargain.

41:59.911 --> 42:01.745
There's going to be a full
investigation into

42:01.812 --> 42:03.280
Metro anti-gang.

42:03.348 --> 42:05.182
And eight-ball?

42:05.250 --> 42:07.350
Between the cyanide and
the emails, homicide is

42:07.418 --> 42:10.353
still convinced he gave
Ross the hot shot.

42:10.421 --> 42:12.021
He's the best candidate.

42:13.290 --> 42:15.058
Excuse me.

42:15.125 --> 42:16.592
Hello?

42:18.462 --> 42:19.628
You're okay...

42:19.696 --> 42:24.099
Honey... it's okay,
I'm all right.

42:24.167 --> 42:27.102
Oh baby...

42:27.170 --> 42:29.304
My sweet angel.

42:29.372 --> 42:31.306
You never asked for
any of this did you.

42:31.374 --> 42:34.309
<i>I'm not
sorry for what I did.</i>

42:34.377 --> 42:36.178
Everything is
going to be okay... Okay?

42:36.245 --> 42:37.312
Okay.

42:37.380 --> 42:38.413
You're going to
be all right.

42:38.481 --> 42:39.413
Okay.

42:39.481 --> 42:41.882
I promise.

42:41.950 --> 42:44.651
What is it?

42:44.719 --> 42:49.290
Remember when I told
you that I hear people's

42:49.357 --> 42:52.326
thoughts I never know if
they're going to do it or

42:52.394 --> 42:53.760
if they've done
it already?

42:53.828 --> 42:55.795
Yeah, what are
you getting at?

42:55.862 --> 42:58.799
I wish I knew.
I wish I knew.
