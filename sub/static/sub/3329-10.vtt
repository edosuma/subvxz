WEBVTT

00:05.300 --> 00:09.566
"Life is stranger than anything
the mind could invent."

00:12.410 --> 00:15.038
That's something
my friend likes to say.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.502
(clears throat)

00:17.550 --> 00:20.371
When I agreed to come
to New York with him,

00:20.420 --> 00:23.309
I was still hurting.

00:23.350 --> 00:26.456
He'd offered an education,
and I was gonna take it.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.481
I was gonna use it.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.387
I'd just listen and I'd learn,

00:31.430 --> 00:35.059
and when the time was right
I would...

00:35.100 --> 00:37.193
move on.

00:38.730 --> 00:41.164
Butthen".

00:41.200 --> 00:43.361
I made another friend.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.401
And another one.

00:47.440 --> 00:51.069
My friend was only half right--
life is strange, but...

00:52.680 --> 00:55.069
...it's also good.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.653
Uh... Kitty, right?

01:04.690 --> 01:07.250
I'm Miranda.

01:07.300 --> 01:10.326
Your friend, the one that
you talk about sometimes,

01:10.370 --> 01:12.565
he's teaching you
to be a detective?

01:12.600 --> 01:15.831
I was wondering if you
could help me with something.

01:15.870 --> 01:18.634
Her name is Tess.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.434
How many days has
she been gone now?

01:21.480 --> 01:23.448
Three.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.641
She's done this before--
let me worry

01:25.680 --> 01:29.309
while she partied
and crashed with friends.

01:29.350 --> 01:32.285
But I've called
everyone I can think of.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.584
They say she
isn't with them.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.656
You're not wearing
a wedding band--

01:36.690 --> 01:39.295
is Dad not in
the picture?

01:39.330 --> 01:41.127
Tess doesn't have a dad.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.422
Not really.

01:42.470 --> 01:46.167
He's the reason
I'm a part of this group.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.169
He was your rapist?

01:49.210 --> 01:52.407
I always told her that
her father was someone I loved,

01:52.440 --> 01:54.374
that he died
before she was born.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.844
But kids grow up.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.848
They get curious.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.440
Last year she started
asking questions.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.415
I figured it was time
I told her the truth.

02:04.450 --> 02:07.715
That's when the partying
started, the running away.

02:07.760 --> 02:12.424
I've been to the cops four times
in the past six months.

02:12.460 --> 02:15.258
I can tell they don't
take me seriously anymore.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.928
So I thought of you.

02:17.970 --> 02:20.495
Will you help me find her?

02:24.510 --> 02:27.604
You've been standing there
for a while now.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.245
I'm thinking.
Well, can you think

02:30.280 --> 02:32.373
a little faster--
the M.E.'s van just pulled up,

02:32.420 --> 02:34.308
and the Kelleys
are pretty ripe.

02:34.350 --> 02:35.874
(sighs):
Hey.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.581
HOLMES_: Watson. Wasn't
expecting you so soon.

02:37.620 --> 02:40.714
Thought you were
with a private client.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.489
Wasn't the job for me.
So what's up?

02:42.530 --> 02:43.724
Certainly not
the Kelleys.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.625
They've been dead
for days.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.821
The housekeeper found them
a couple hours ago.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.498
They were both
in their 805,

02:49.530 --> 02:51.259
but the odds that
they died naturally

02:51.300 --> 02:53.439
and at exactly
the same time are slim.

02:53.470 --> 02:55.438
He's just been
staring at 'em.

02:55.470 --> 02:56.960
I was waiting for Watson.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.501
As you know, I find
nothing helps clear up a case

02:59.540 --> 03:00.609
like stating it
to another person.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.642
What am I?

03:02.680 --> 03:04.807
The detective is right
to be suspicious

03:04.850 --> 03:06.408
of the Kelleys' deaths.

03:06.450 --> 03:08.509
(sniffing)
It's unlikely they'd shuffle off

03:08.550 --> 03:09.847
this mortal coil simultaneously.

03:09.890 --> 03:13.519
Well, I don't see any signs
of a struggle.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.585
Maybe it was
a suicide pact.

03:15.620 --> 03:17.520
They both took poison?

03:17.560 --> 03:20.552
HOLMES: While I do believe
that poison was involved,

03:20.600 --> 03:22.693
they most assuredly
did not take their own lives.

03:22.730 --> 03:24.561
You're saying someone
else poisoned 'em?

03:24.600 --> 03:27.262
I am.
Only it was unintentional.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.858
The Kelleys are casualties

03:28.900 --> 03:32.438
of a crime committed
elsewhere in the building.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.314
While it was difficult to detect
beneath the Kelleys'--

03:40.350 --> 03:42.580
how did you put it?--
ripeness,

03:42.620 --> 03:44.679
I could smell traces
of butadiene

03:44.720 --> 03:47.280
around the air vent
in their bedroom.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.856
And butadiene is...?

03:48.890 --> 03:51.620
(exhales, sniffs)
Is a toxic,
gaseous by-product

03:51.660 --> 03:53.389
of burning rubber.

03:53.430 --> 03:54.920
It's what
you're smelling now.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.463
(sniffing) The rest of it
dissipated days ago,

03:57.500 --> 03:59.468
so we're in no danger.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.661
What, you think someone
set a fire down here?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.338
Of sorts.

04:04.670 --> 04:07.468
This building is
a converted brownstone.

04:07.510 --> 04:09.034
Each of the three
floors above

04:09.080 --> 04:11.548
_ has been turned
Into an apartment.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.719
But the vents
still allocate air

04:13.750 --> 04:15.775
from a main return line.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.981
The Kelleys live
on the first floor.

04:18.020 --> 04:20.352
They took the brunt of the gas.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.824
Do we know if the other
residents are okay?

04:22.860 --> 04:24.828
Uh, the third-floor
apartment's vacant,

04:24.860 --> 04:26.521
and _the second floor
is occupied,

04:26.560 --> 04:28.619
but we checked--
the owner wasn't home.

04:28.660 --> 04:30.321
I'd be curious
to know if he owns

04:30.370 --> 04:31.496
a pair of teal running shoes.

04:31.530 --> 04:32.667
Why?

04:32.700 --> 04:34.065
Because...

04:34.100 --> 04:37.035
it would mean
he was home after all.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.525
(sighs):
So, that's him.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.697
Dead guy in
the basement.

05:05.730 --> 05:08.039
It's going to take
dental records to conﬁrm it,

05:08.070 --> 05:09.731
but... I believe so.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.738
The man downstairs
has the same

05:11.770 --> 05:13.909
arrangement of moles
on his hand.

05:13.940 --> 05:14.929
Hmm.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.538
"Clay Dubrovensky."

05:16.580 --> 05:18.104
He's got a doctorate
in botany

05:18.150 --> 05:19.947
and genetic engineering.
Doesn't look like

05:19.980 --> 05:21.572
your average
doctor, does he?

05:21.620 --> 05:23.588
No. Looks like Point Break

05:23.620 --> 05:25.645
and Magic Mike
had a baby.

05:25.690 --> 05:27.749
They're, uh...

05:27.790 --> 05:30.327
Trifles of the cinema,
I take it.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.655
No Kitty today?

05:33.700 --> 05:35.793
She's working a
case of her own.

05:35.830 --> 05:38.594
WATSON:
So, how's everything going?

05:38.630 --> 05:41.497
Last time I saw you,
you weren't doing so well.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.929
I'm better, thank you.

05:43.970 --> 05:46.837
I still have disappointments
with regards to my sobriety,

05:46.880 --> 05:49.974
but... _I've resumed
attending meetings.

05:51.580 --> 05:52.911
How are you?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.547
Well, according to the super,

05:55.580 --> 05:57.013
Clay Dubrovensky was
a dream tenant.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.642
He was living
off an inheritance,

05:58.690 --> 06:00.510
he always paid
his rent on time...

06:00.560 --> 06:01.982
And his method of
execution suggests

06:02.020 --> 06:03.681
a tie to organized crime.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.550
Micro-ondas.

06:05.590 --> 06:06.796
Aka "necklacing."
You take a tire,

06:06.830 --> 06:08.593
you hang it
on the victim's neck,

06:08.630 --> 06:10.564
you fill it with petroleum,
light a match...

06:10.600 --> 06:12.636
(imitates flames
flaring)

06:12.670 --> 06:14.729
Doesn't get much more cartel
than that.
I remember

06:14.770 --> 06:17.898
there were a couple
of similar murders last summer.
There have, in fact,

06:17.940 --> 06:19.635
been ten such killings
in New York

06:19.680 --> 06:21.079
over the last five years.

06:21.110 --> 06:22.941
In each case, the
suspects were soldiers

06:22.980 --> 06:25.676
for a Brazilian syndicate
called the SDS,

06:25.710 --> 06:27.746
or Sangue do Sangue.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.613
Dubrovensky had an
emergency contact on his lease,

06:30.650 --> 06:32.709
a woman by the name
of Courtney Stever.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.058
She's on her way to the station.
Maybe she can tell us

06:35.090 --> 06:37.081
why the SDS
would have wanted him dead.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.951
And you're sure
that it was Clay?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.592
I mean, you're
really sure?

06:41.630 --> 06:43.666
The M.E. won't make
an official ruling

06:43.700 --> 06:44.894
for at least a few hours...

06:44.930 --> 06:47.467
It was him.
The more photographs I saw,

06:47.500 --> 06:48.933
the clearer it became.

06:48.970 --> 06:52.098
Mr. Dubrovensky is...
quite dead.

06:54.110 --> 06:56.670
Can I ask how the two
of you knew each other?

06:58.110 --> 07:00.078
Clay was my ex...

07:00.120 --> 07:01.542
sort of.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.013
We broke up last year.

07:03.050 --> 07:05.917
He was cheating on me.
He kind of did that a lot.

07:05.950 --> 07:08.009
A few months ago,

07:08.060 --> 07:09.857
we ran_into each other
in a club,

07:09.890 --> 07:11.926
and, I don't know, we...

07:11.960 --> 07:14.155
just fell back into old rhythms.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.760
You slept together?

07:16.800 --> 07:18.722
And a few weeks later,
it happened again,

07:18.770 --> 07:20.089
and then again.

07:20.140 --> 07:23.234
We weren't back together,
but we were...

07:23.270 --> 07:25.067
enjoying ourselves.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.670
Plus, he had
excellent cannabis, no?

07:27.710 --> 07:29.075
WATSON:
The evidence suggests

07:29.110 --> 07:31.249
that he was killed
by a drug cartel.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.840
We did find bricks of cash,
growing supplies,

07:33.880 --> 07:36.041
doctorates in botany
and genetics.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.481
Your ex was a grower for
the SDS cartel, was he not?

07:39.520 --> 07:41.579
Specifically,
a cultivator of marijuana.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.879
Clay did not just grow pot.

07:45.930 --> 07:47.659
Okay? He engineered it.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.099
He was an artist.

07:49.130 --> 07:51.098
And the people
that he worked for

07:51.130 --> 07:52.631
never got that.

07:52.670 --> 07:54.490
What do you mean?
He told me

07:54.540 --> 07:56.861
that he started messing
with marijuana strains

07:56.910 --> 07:58.559
in grad school.

07:58.610 --> 07:59.770
Mixing, matching.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.778
But he never even
smoked the stuff.

08:01.810 --> 08:03.778
He just... knew
how to help it,

08:03.810 --> 08:05.641
knew how to
make it better.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.808
A few dealers took notice,
only they didn't want

08:08.850 --> 08:10.010
to hurt him.

08:10.050 --> 08:12.018
They wanted to hire him?
Yeah, and he worked

08:12.050 --> 08:14.848
for the SDS cartel
ever Since.

08:14.890 --> 08:19.657
Can you think of any reason
why they would want to hurt him?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.156
He got bored.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.863
He wanted a... a real lab,
real equipment.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.868
I don't know.

08:26.900 --> 08:30.904
Maybe he just finally
pushed them too far.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.839
This is new.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.984
Complete inversions
allow the human body

08:44.020 --> 08:46.614
to flush and detoxify
the adrenal glands,

08:46.660 --> 08:48.855
which studies have linked
to more positive thinking

08:48.890 --> 08:51.279
_ and an increase
in reasoning skills.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.056
You really must try it sometime.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.261
"Clay Dubrovensky."

08:57.300 --> 08:58.995
Is that the name you texted me?
Yeah.

08:59.030 --> 09:01.897
His lover was unable to_ name
any of his cartel assoqates,

09:01.940 --> 09:04.932
but she did know that
the grow house where he worked

09:04.970 --> 09:07.803
was, I quote,
"somewhere in Brooklyn."

09:07.840 --> 09:09.603
I'm attempting
to divine

09:09.650 --> 09:11.777
its specific whereabouts.
Any luck, there will be

09:11.810 --> 09:13.778
personnel there
that we can question.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.276
How goes your investigation?

09:15.320 --> 09:17.788
I spent the better
part of the day

09:17.820 --> 09:21.210
talking to the missing
girl's friends and poking
around her laptop.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.952
I applied your many and varied
rules of observation,

09:25.990 --> 09:28.754
and yielded a
single deduction.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.620
She's a brat.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.297
You don't think she's in danger?

09:32.330 --> 09:34.935
There's no doubt she's
in the habit of running away.

09:34.970 --> 09:37.006
And nothing bad
ever happens to runaways.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.133
But the evidence
would seem to suggest

09:39.170 --> 09:41.001
that she'll just come home
when she's ready.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.144
That said, I will...

09:43.180 --> 09:45.307
renew my hunt in the morning.

09:45.350 --> 09:46.977
Sure you don't want a go?

09:47.020 --> 09:48.840
Quite.

09:50.850 --> 09:54.718
(clears throat)
Did, um, Watson
talk to you today?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.921
No. We communicated
telepathically.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.929
Of course we spoke.
She's helping me
with my investigation.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.359
Why do you ask?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.766
She just hasn't been around
for a while.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.688
Just say hello for me, will you?

10:10.870 --> 10:13.737
(whirring loudly)

10:20.950 --> 10:23.180
WATSON:
Hello?

10:23.220 --> 10:24.915
Smoothie?

10:29.220 --> 10:31.188
You break into my home
all the time.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.697
That is because

10:32.730 --> 10:33.924
you force me to.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.190
I think I may have found the
address of Clay Dubrovensky's

10:36.230 --> 10:38.892
Brooklyn
grow house.
How?

10:38.930 --> 10:41.034
Rubles.

10:41.070 --> 10:43.061
There was change
found in his pocket.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.237
Three dimes,
a nickel,

10:45.270 --> 10:48.239
two coins just like this one.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.100
It's a five-ruble piece.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.916
It's similar in size and texture
to an American quarter.

10:53.950 --> 10:56.919
There were similar coins
found on his counter.

10:56.950 --> 11:00.056
As you can see, they're also
mixed in with American currency.

11:00.090 --> 11:03.924
Now, these coins are the very
opposite of collectible.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.848
It's most likely
he received them mistakenly

11:05.890 --> 11:08.029
as change
in a Russian neighborhood.

11:08.060 --> 11:10.369
(sighs)
There's a big Russian community

11:10.400 --> 11:11.958
in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.868
Mm-hmm. Now, as you are
no doubt aware, a grow house

11:15.900 --> 11:17.800
would require an extremely
high volume of grow lamps

11:17.840 --> 11:20.832
to be running at all times.
So with the help of the captain,

11:20.880 --> 11:23.747
I identified the largest
noncommercial consumer

11:23.780 --> 11:26.749
of kilowatt hours in the area.

11:26.780 --> 11:29.271
He and a phalanx of ESU officers
are on their way

11:29.320 --> 11:31.709
as we speak.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.308
Right. I'll get dressed.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.316
Oh, before you do,

11:35.360 --> 11:37.157
I-I think it's best if we talk.

11:37.190 --> 11:38.885
About?

11:38.930 --> 11:41.194
Whatever it was you wanted
to discuss with me yesterday.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.490
You seemed quite pregnant
at Dubrovenslq's apartment.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.168
You've obviously already
discussed it with Kitty.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.306
How could you...
The motives
of some women are inscrutable.

11:51.340 --> 11:53.308
_ _ Their most
trIVIal action may mean

11:53.340 --> 11:55.877
volumes, their most
extraordinary conduct

11:55.910 --> 11:57.309
may depend upon a hairpin.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.978
You two
are not like that.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.083
I'm folding
my private detective business

12:08.120 --> 12:09.758
and I'm going
to go work for Leda.

12:09.790 --> 12:11.155
They're a global
insurance company.

12:11.190 --> 12:12.999
I'm gonna be one of their
in-house investigators.

12:15.030 --> 12:17.965
I did some freelance work
for them a few months ago

12:18.000 --> 12:19.422
and they were impressed,
so they asked me

12:19.470 --> 12:20.937
to join on a more
permanent basis.

12:20.970 --> 12:23.109
This isn't really
gonna change

12:23.140 --> 12:25.062
the work that you and I do.

12:25.110 --> 12:27.328
This balance that we've struck--

12:27.380 --> 12:29.109
my cases, your cases, our cases.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.300
That is not
gonna change.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.942
I'm gonna have time
to work for Leda

12:31.980 --> 12:33.516
and the department.
That is the only way

12:33.550 --> 12:34.869
I agreed to sign on.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.947
An insurance company.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.185
Yeah, I like the
people there.

12:40.220 --> 12:44.020
Listen, I was gonna
tell you a few weeks ago,

12:44.060 --> 12:46.995
but you were struggling,
and-and the last time I told you

12:47.030 --> 12:49.089
I wanted to make a change,
you took off to London.

12:49.130 --> 12:51.121
(phone dings)

12:54.170 --> 12:55.831
It's the captain.

12:55.870 --> 12:58.009
The residence
we identified

12:58.040 --> 13:00.031
is Dubrovensky's grow house.

13:01.410 --> 13:04.208
He's expecting us.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.946
No one was here
when we took the door.

13:06.980 --> 13:08.242
Which is not so weird

13:08.280 --> 13:11.511
in and of itself, but...

13:11.550 --> 13:13.552
take a look at these plants.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.126
They're dying.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.821
Not all of them.

13:18.860 --> 13:21.351
But a lot. At least a couple
hundred grand worth.

13:21.400 --> 13:26.064
Says to me that Dubrovenslq was
the only guy who worked here.

13:26.100 --> 13:29.092
He died, his plants
started to follow.

13:29.140 --> 13:32.530
Only they were never
his plants, right?

13:32.570 --> 13:35.573
They were the cartel's, so why
would they just let them die?

13:35.610 --> 13:38.044
Perhaps they didn't
know he'd been killed.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.604
Aren't we thinking

13:39.650 --> 13:42.039
that they killed him?

13:42.080 --> 13:44.947
Are either of you familiar
with the Wutai Pingtung orchid?

13:44.990 --> 13:46.412
It originated

13:46.450 --> 13:49.214
in the remote_
Wutai region of Taiwan.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.319
Decades of commercial _
development saw the extinction

13:51.360 --> 13:54.488
of the moths that pollinated
them. The orchids died off

13:54.530 --> 13:57.226
until only one remained,
making it the absolute

13:57.270 --> 13:58.919
rarest of
rare flowers.

13:58.970 --> 14:00.267
There is
only one

14:00.300 --> 14:02.097
living in the entire world,

14:02.140 --> 14:04.165
and it has an estimated value
of a quarter

14:04.210 --> 14:05.563
of a million
dollars.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.202
Fascinating.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.299
What has it got to
do with any of this?

14:09.340 --> 14:11.399
Just over a year ago
the Wutai Pingtung

14:11.450 --> 14:14.078
_ was _stolen from an
international flower show.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.213
And it's sitting
right over there.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.221
We thought

14:25.260 --> 14:26.329
Mr. Dubrovensky
was killed

14:26.360 --> 14:28.191
over plants that
you can smoke.

14:28.230 --> 14:32.098
Perhaps he was killed
over one you cannot.

14:43.710 --> 14:44.506
Autopsy report

14:44.550 --> 14:46.199
on Clay Dubrovenslq.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.912
I am now quite certain
the SDS did not kill him.

14:48.950 --> 14:51.612
Still think he died
over a flower?

14:51.650 --> 14:54.619
As I explained,
this is no mere flower.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.355
This is the Wu...

14:56.390 --> 14:58.950
Wutai Pingtung.
It's rare. I get it.

14:58.990 --> 15:01.629
An honest politician is rare.

15:01.660 --> 15:03.594
A marriage
worth the bother is rare.

15:03.630 --> 15:06.895
This is the only orchid
of its kind in existence.

15:08.570 --> 15:10.333
It says here
that Dubrovensky was dead

15:10.370 --> 15:12.167
before he was
lit on fire.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.974
Succumbed to blunt force trauma
in the back of his skull.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.477
But isn't the whole point
of necklacing

15:16.510 --> 15:18.478
to burn the victim
while he's still alive?

15:18.510 --> 15:20.375
Hmm. Would have been
quite sporting of them

15:20.420 --> 15:22.012
to kill him prior
to ignition, no?

15:22.050 --> 15:23.517
Maybe it was
a rival gang.

15:23.550 --> 15:26.587
They kill Dubrovenslq
and then frame the SDS.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.611
Cartels don't frame people.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.481
They sign their work
repeatedly and aggressively.

15:31.530 --> 15:34.624
So this orchid was stolen
over a year ago by Dubrovensky?

15:34.660 --> 15:36.651
That's one
possibility.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.999
Another possibility is that he
bought it on the black market.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.667
There's a black market
for flowers?

15:41.700 --> 15:44.203
Ish. Most transactions
are completed

15:44.240 --> 15:46.629
via online auction sites.

15:46.670 --> 15:49.639
The thief lists, um...
a more innocuous item.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.138
This can,
for example.

15:53.180 --> 15:55.569
And then positions it
in front of the item

15:55.620 --> 15:57.611
that he really wishes to sell.

15:59.590 --> 16:01.717
To the untrained eye, the flower
looks like mere backdrop.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.580
Okay, so what happens

16:03.630 --> 16:05.723
when my soda
sells for $250,000?

16:05.760 --> 16:07.227
Won't that raise a few eyebrows?

16:07.260 --> 16:09.125
You keep the auction private.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.219
And it's established beforehand
that a bid of one dollar

16:11.270 --> 16:13.158
is actually worth
$100 or $1,000,

16:13.200 --> 16:15.259
so an item that appears
to have sold for $15...

16:15.300 --> 16:17.131
Is actually going for 15 grand.

16:17.170 --> 16:18.637
It's possible
that

16:18.670 --> 16:21.503
Dubrovensky successfully bid
on the orchid...

16:21.540 --> 16:23.508
and then the losing bidder

16:23.550 --> 16:26.144
came looking for him.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.977
What about the flower's
original owner?

16:29.650 --> 16:31.481
Less original owner

16:31.520 --> 16:34.785
and more discoverer.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.287
I don't like him

16:36.320 --> 16:38.254
for a flaming tire murder,
do you?

16:38.290 --> 16:39.587
(door opens)

16:39.630 --> 16:42.451
Lexi?

16:42.500 --> 16:44.991
Huh. Cool place.

16:48.470 --> 16:51.439
Do-Do you have any coffee here?
Maybe an espresso machine?

16:51.470 --> 16:53.631
You texted me. You told me
that you might be able

16:53.680 --> 16:55.636
to help me find Tess.
Yeah, I heard
you were

16:55.680 --> 16:57.807
asking about her. A friend
at school gave me your number.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.318
Look, she called me
last week. She thought

17:00.350 --> 17:03.046
some guy in a white Jaguar
was following her.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.684
I told her it was
the stuff we smoked that day

17:05.720 --> 17:07.517
and she was paranoid.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.357
She's been gone four days now.

17:09.390 --> 17:11.085
Do you still think
she was paranoid?

17:12.560 --> 17:15.051
When she called, did she
describe the driver?

17:15.100 --> 17:16.351
No.

17:16.400 --> 17:20.769
But I do have
the license plate.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.358
You thought she was
paranoid and yet

17:22.400 --> 17:23.606
you took down the plate number?

17:23.640 --> 17:25.335
I guess.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.444
Murderers.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.708
VVho?

17:32.750 --> 17:34.775
All of them.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.640
WOMAN :
Detective Bell.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.716
Barbara Conway.
I'm senior

17:38.750 --> 17:40.217
vice president of...
Senior vice president
of AgriNext's

17:40.260 --> 17:41.784
GMO research division.

17:41.820 --> 17:45.085
Quite the corporate
monstrosity, AgriNext, hmm?

17:45.130 --> 17:47.496
In addition to your dominance
in agricultural industries,

17:47.530 --> 17:49.418
there is powerful
evidence to suggest

17:49.460 --> 17:51.098
that your neonicotinoid
insecticides

17:51.130 --> 17:53.439
are the culprits in the
ongoing bee genocide

17:53.470 --> 17:55.495
known as colony collapse
disorder. Would you care

17:55.540 --> 17:58.236
to comment on that?
When you told
my assistant you had

18:01.180 --> 18:02.431
BELL:
Ms. Conway,

18:02.480 --> 18:03.572
are you familiar with the name

18:03.610 --> 18:04.804
Clay Dubrovensky?

18:04.850 --> 18:08.342
No.
What about the Wutai
Pingtung orchid?

18:08.380 --> 18:11.543
I'm sorry. What?
You are very good
at feigning innocence.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.182
Perhaps it's all that
lying about the bees.

18:13.220 --> 18:15.814
Clay Dubrovensky was
found murdered yesterday.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.657
Now, my colleagues
checked his Internet history,

18:17.690 --> 18:19.157
'cause they thought
it might have had

18:19.190 --> 18:20.396
something to do
with his purchase

18:20.430 --> 18:21.852
of the orchid.
Instead, we found

18:21.900 --> 18:24.391
record of him selling it.

18:24.430 --> 18:27.194
To you.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.732
Please don't ask us to
believe that you paid $89

18:31.770 --> 18:33.909
for a bureau that
just happens to have

18:33.940 --> 18:36.534
one of the world's rares_t
flowers Sitting on top of it.

18:36.580 --> 18:38.901
We are well aware
of the codes

18:38.950 --> 18:42.772
and price multiples employed
in such illegal transactions.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.219
The day after the auction
ended, Dubrovenslq

18:44.250 --> 18:47.185
deposited a cashier's check
for $89,000

18:47.220 --> 18:49.518
into a bank account.
You thought

18:49.560 --> 18:52.882
you were getting the only Wutai
Pingtung orchid in the world

18:52.930 --> 18:54.352
for a virtual steal.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.267
Only Mr. Dubrovensky
never delivered.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.427
He kept it for himself.

18:59.470 --> 19:01.233
But you couldn't complain
to the auction site or go

19:01.270 --> 19:03.363
to the police. Not without
admitting that you had

19:03.410 --> 19:05.867
tried to purchase a very
valuable stolen object.

19:05.910 --> 19:08.470
You track
Mr. Dubrovensky down,

19:08.510 --> 19:11.172
you confront him,
things go poorly.

19:11.210 --> 19:13.644
I'm not sure how you knew
to frame the SDS cartel

19:13.680 --> 19:15.648
for his murder,
but, I don't know,

19:15.680 --> 19:17.944
perhaps you bought
furniture from him before.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.811
You're right,
I did buy that bureau.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.784
But if you're saying
this Dubrovenslq person

19:23.830 --> 19:26.856
was the seller-- okay, sure.
I only ever knew him

19:26.890 --> 19:28.824
by his account name.
Ms. Conway...

19:28.860 --> 19:30.896
He threw the flower in for free.

19:30.930 --> 19:33.899
It's_in the conference _room
if you'd like to see it.

19:36.870 --> 19:39.703
I think it's one of the most
beautiful things I've ever seen.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.334
But I would never
pay $89,000 for it.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.972
If you need it
for your investigation,

19:44.010 --> 19:46.604
by all means, take it.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.512
I'm sorry
I'm not

19:49.550 --> 19:52.314
the murderer
you were hoping I was.

19:52.350 --> 19:54.318
MAN:
For the last time,

19:54.360 --> 19:56.920
I've never _seen this
girl before in my life.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.929
But you do own the vehicle
that was described to us.
(sighs)

19:59.960 --> 20:02.724
The plates we were given
come back to you.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.227
Which can only mean
that someone's

20:04.270 --> 20:05.692
playing some sort
of stupid prank.

20:05.730 --> 20:08.233
What about this girl?
You ever seen

20:08.270 --> 20:09.999
her before?
This is

20:10.040 --> 20:12.508
amazing. Why don't you just show
me photos of every missing girl

20:12.540 --> 20:15.577
in the city? It's not like I
don't have anything else to do.

20:15.610 --> 20:18.340
This girl told a friend
that she saw your car

20:18.380 --> 20:21.372
following her
last Saturday, so if you

20:21.420 --> 20:23.945
want us to get you...
Oh, wait, wait, wait a
second. Last Saturday?

20:25.420 --> 20:27.456
Was she in
Baltimore?

20:27.490 --> 20:28.957
No.

20:28.990 --> 20:31.379
Well, that's interesting,
because I was.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.898
My son's lacrosse team had a
tournament. We took the Jag.

20:33.930 --> 20:36.899
You want to ask me more
questions, contact my attorney.

20:36.930 --> 20:38.921
Mr. Perryman, before you go...

20:42.840 --> 20:45.968
Has anyone ever told you that
you have a queer left thumb?

20:53.420 --> 20:55.980
What was that about?

20:56.020 --> 20:59.444
I don't think he did it.
I don't think he took Tess.

20:59.490 --> 21:02.516
But I thinkI know
how to find her.

21:06.490 --> 21:09.857
So there are two Wutai Pingtung
orchids left, not one.

21:09.900 --> 21:10.798
So what?

21:10.830 --> 21:13.867
It was my understanding
that was impossible.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.663
And your understanding
can never be wrong?

21:15.700 --> 21:17.565
Did you notice these bags

21:17.610 --> 21:20.067
the AgriNext lady left
in the box with the orchid?

21:20.110 --> 21:21.873
Yep. They're plant food.

21:21.910 --> 21:23.036
So, what do you think?

21:23.080 --> 21:25.548
They look hungry? Ooh.

21:25.580 --> 21:26.877
You wish to kill them?

21:26.910 --> 21:28.070
You just said this was food.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.712
For some other plants.

21:29.750 --> 21:30.978
Can you not tell by the smell?

21:31.020 --> 21:32.885
That's ground coffee
and dried mackerel.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.854
Mackerel has an extremely high
nitrogen content,

21:34.890 --> 21:37.358
too high for orchids.

21:37.390 --> 21:38.982
Ms. Conway gave us that bag
by mistake.

21:39.030 --> 21:42.352
The correct one
is the other bag.

21:46.470 --> 21:48.938
What, were you worried
I was going to kill them

21:48.970 --> 21:50.096
before you could?

21:50.140 --> 21:51.960
Root structures
are like fingerprints--

21:52.010 --> 21:53.671
no two are the same.

21:53.710 --> 21:55.507
These are identical.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.405
Okay, how could you possibly...

21:57.450 --> 21:59.509
They're also the root
structures of plants

21:59.550 --> 22:00.869
no older than six months.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.013
The real Wutai Pingtung
is five years old.

22:03.050 --> 22:05.587
Wait a minute, are you saying
that these are fakes?

22:05.620 --> 22:06.917
Clones.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.986
Mr. Dubrovensky's lover
said he had grown bored.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.580
He has doctorates in botany.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.086
And genetics.

22:13.130 --> 22:14.620
If he never laid hands
on the original orchid,

22:14.660 --> 22:16.457
he at least acquired a cutting.

22:16.500 --> 22:17.797
That would've been more
than enough to make him

22:17.830 --> 22:19.798
the floral equivalent
of a forger.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.969
The AgriNext exec,
Barbara Conway,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.104
maybe she realized she bought
a fake and confronted him.

22:24.140 --> 22:26.108
Dubrovensky could've produced
dozens of clones,

22:26.140 --> 22:29.837
which means his scam could've
been executed dozens of times.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.098
Ms. Conway should return
to our suspect list.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.846
But we should also look
for evidence of other victims.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.945
What are you doing?

22:37.990 --> 22:40.515
Well, they may be fakes
but they're still beautiful.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.654
I am going to water them.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.869
It occurs to me I haven't
congratulated you

22:50.900 --> 22:55.496
on your new venture with the
insurance company, Leda.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.861
Congratulations.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.435
Thanks.

23:01.710 --> 23:03.177
I understand why you waited
to tell me.

23:03.210 --> 23:07.044
Um, I do tend to react poorly
to change.

23:07.080 --> 23:10.174
Well, like I said, this
shouldn't be much change at all.

23:10.220 --> 23:12.142
I'll still be at the precinct
all the time.

23:12.190 --> 23:14.909
Even if you weren't,
it's your life, Watson.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.916
I've no right
to a monopoly.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.748
Uh, the truth is,

23:20.800 --> 23:22.620
I've been considering
a change of my own.

23:22.660 --> 23:26.619
It's completely unrelated
to your news, I assure you,

23:26.670 --> 23:28.433
(phone ringing)
but it has been weighing
on my mind

23:28.470 --> 23:30.631
and I thought I should
apprise you of it.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.638
(ringing continues)
Um, isn't that your phone?

23:32.670 --> 23:34.809
It can wait.
(other phone ringing)

23:34.840 --> 23:36.432
(sighs)

23:36.480 --> 23:37.902
It's Captain Gregson.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.178
Hello.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.472
Is Holmes with you?

23:40.520 --> 23:42.647
Yeah, he's right here.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.079
I thought you two
would want to know

23:44.120 --> 23:46.645
there were two more necklace
murders tonight.

23:46.690 --> 23:49.784
The killers left a message
this time.

23:49.820 --> 23:51.219
"Guerra Guerra."

23:51.260 --> 23:52.989
Portuguese vernacular.

23:53.030 --> 23:56.090
It colloquially translates
as "This means war."

23:56.130 --> 23:58.769
Usually I would've figured
it was for another gang,

23:58.800 --> 24:02.497
but this is the opposite
of gang territory.

24:02.540 --> 24:05.065
I'm standing in front
of the AgriNext

24:05.110 --> 24:07.738
corporate headquarters
in Whitestone.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.133
You guys were here today, right?

24:09.180 --> 24:11.478
We were.

24:11.510 --> 24:13.171
I'm going to go out
on a limb here and say

24:13.210 --> 24:15.212
this wasn't a coincidence.

24:19.850 --> 24:22.080
GREGSON:
William Keller, AgriNext's CFO.

24:22.120 --> 24:25.248
And this is Nelson Shelby,

24:25.290 --> 24:27.690
one of their board of directors.

24:27.730 --> 24:29.789
Now, as far as we can tell,

24:29.830 --> 24:32.196
they were abducted as they
reached their residences

24:32.230 --> 24:35.563
last night, presumably
by members of the SDS.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.637
But why does the cartel want
to kill off AgriNext executives?

24:38.670 --> 24:40.672
I talked to a
company spokesman.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.575
The official line
is "no idea,"

24:42.610 --> 24:46.171
but off the record, their best
guess is political retaliation.

24:46.210 --> 24:48.872
Brazil's a billion-dollar
market for AgriNext

24:48.920 --> 24:51.138
so they pump millions
into local elections.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.646
Buys them influence
over policy decisions.

24:52.690 --> 24:54.180
Guy said sometimes

24:54.220 --> 24:57.155
the drug cartels just don't like
the candidates they back.

24:57.190 --> 24:58.555
Uh-huh, that's bollocks.

24:58.590 --> 25:00.023
On the record and off.

25:00.060 --> 25:01.823
In your experience,
Detective,

25:01.860 --> 25:04.124
how often does the party
on the receiving end

25:04.170 --> 25:06.730
of a cartel assassination say,

25:06.770 --> 25:09.591
"If only we knew what we'd done
to upset them?" No.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.562
When a_criminal
organization

25:11.610 --> 25:14.078
sends a violent message,
it does so with a certainty

25:14.110 --> 25:15.634
that that message is clear.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.001
AgriNext knows
and they're just not telling us.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.917
You guys were at
AgriNext yesterday.

25:20.950 --> 25:23.077
You talk to_another
executive?

25:23.120 --> 25:25.111
Yeah, we thought she might
have something to do with
the Dubrovenslq murder.

25:25.150 --> 25:28.017
She?
Her name is Barbara Conway

25:28.060 --> 25:29.584
and she runs
the GMO department.

25:29.620 --> 25:31.759
Well, she's in the clear
for these two.

25:31.790 --> 25:33.929
Witness saw a Hispanic male

25:33.960 --> 25:35.655
light them up. 305.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.292
We're getting a
sketch going.

25:37.330 --> 25:39.924
Maybe he's also the guy
who did Dubrovensky.

25:39.970 --> 25:43.167
The rope used to bind
the victims' hands and feet,

25:43.200 --> 25:45.304
it's intact.

25:45.340 --> 25:47.160
Now, most rope would
disintegrate

25:47.210 --> 25:48.609
at the temperature
of a burning tire.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.108
This is para-aramid rope.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.141
It's made
for the express purpose

25:53.180 --> 25:55.171
of resisting extreme heat.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.211
It's a logical choice
for an organization

25:57.250 --> 25:59.810
in the habit of burning
people alive, right?

25:59.850 --> 26:01.852
Can't be too many places
that sell this stuff.

26:01.890 --> 26:04.256
Military surplus,
fire and rescue gear.

26:04.290 --> 26:06.178
I'll make a few calls and
get that sketch out there.

26:06.230 --> 26:08.619
HOLMES:
You will recall, however,

26:08.660 --> 26:11.766
that Clay Dubrovensky was not
bound with para-aramid rope,

26:11.800 --> 26:14.064
further suggesting he was not
killed by the cartel.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.738
BELL:
You still like
Barbara Conway?

26:15.770 --> 26:17.169
Watson and I
still believe

26:17.200 --> 26:19.907
that she had motive
to want him dead.

26:19.940 --> 26:22.238
Plus, she worked
with these two.

26:24.010 --> 26:27.377
You're right, I was not entirely
forthcoming with you yesterday.

26:27.410 --> 26:30.789
I started collecting

26:30.820 --> 26:32.185
flowers ten years ago.

26:32.220 --> 26:35.917
I'd been promoted,
I was making real money.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.781
I could afford
an expensive hobby.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.354
So, you admit that you thought
you were buying

26:40.390 --> 26:43.928
the real Wutai Pingtung orchid
from Mr. Dubrovenslq.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.926
It was the craziest
thing I'd ever done,

26:45.970 --> 26:47.198
but it was so beautiful,

26:47.230 --> 26:50.393
it was so unique that I...

26:50.440 --> 26:54.399
Eventually I realized it was
a fake, just like you said.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.409
And you'd been conned
out of 89 grand.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.998
That was nothing to me.

26:59.050 --> 27:02.247
I mean, I know how that sounds,
but it's true.

27:02.280 --> 27:05.113
Besides, I wasn't angry.

27:05.150 --> 27:07.141
I was impressed.

27:07.190 --> 27:10.956
Duplicating something
as delicate as that orchid,

27:10.990 --> 27:13.959
something as complex, it's...

27:14.000 --> 27:15.422
it's more than a science.

27:15.460 --> 27:17.121
RSanad.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.299
I showed it to a few
of my colleagues,

27:19.330 --> 27:20.968
and they agreed.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.128
I used the company's resources
to track Clay down.

27:24.170 --> 27:26.263
I offered him a job

27:26.310 --> 27:28.870
at AgriNext.

27:28.910 --> 27:32.141
That's when I found out
about his other business.

27:32.180 --> 27:34.876
He told you he was a grower
for the SDS.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.979
How did that go over
with human resources?

27:38.220 --> 27:41.451
It made us want him even more.

27:41.490 --> 27:44.687
It's nothing we've
been advertising,

27:44.730 --> 27:46.049
but AgriNext has been preparing

27:46.090 --> 27:48.024
for legalized marijuana
for years.

27:48.060 --> 27:49.698
As soon as the legislation
catches up,

27:49.730 --> 27:50.992
we'll be ready to move.

27:51.030 --> 27:52.918
So, you wanted to hire him,

27:52.970 --> 27:55.336
but he already had an employer.

27:55.370 --> 27:57.031
It was complicated.

27:57.070 --> 27:58.958
Clay was excited about the
possibility of going legit,

27:59.010 --> 28:02.002
not to mention getting his hands
on AgriNext's resources.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.008
He knew he could do great things
with us,

28:04.050 --> 28:06.905
but he couldn't just quit
the SDS.

28:06.950 --> 28:08.975
We had to buy him out.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.012
So you entered into a
negotiation with a drug cartel.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.450
Right.

28:14.490 --> 28:16.481
You know, decorum forbids me
from showing my emotions

28:16.520 --> 28:18.920
during an interview such as
this one, but I assure you,

28:18.960 --> 28:21.997
on the inside, I am
doubled over with laughter.

28:22.030 --> 28:23.827
BARBARA:
Clay went to the cartel.

28:23.870 --> 28:28.398
They set a price-- $10 million.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.260
The company countered
at $5 million.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.030
And now Inside Me
is soiling himself.

28:33.070 --> 28:34.469
(sighs)

28:34.510 --> 28:36.137
BARBARA:
He called me the
night he was killed.

28:36.180 --> 28:39.001
He told me that he was going
to meet with the cartel,

28:39.050 --> 28:41.518
tell them to accept the offer.

28:41.550 --> 28:44.144
Because he had decided
that he was going to come

28:44.190 --> 28:46.511
and work for our company
no matter what.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.188
Obviously they didn't
appreciate that.

28:48.220 --> 28:50.279
They killed him

28:50.320 --> 28:52.459
and then they killed Nelson
and William last night

28:52.490 --> 28:53.991
for good measure.

28:54.030 --> 28:57.124
These higher-ups you mentioned,
can we assume

28:57.160 --> 28:59.822
that they'll confirm
everything you just told us?

29:01.070 --> 29:04.938
If they don't,
I have the memos that will.

29:06.170 --> 29:08.377
(bird cawing in distance)

29:08.410 --> 29:10.970
(sighs)

29:15.150 --> 29:17.072
Morning, Tess.

29:19.290 --> 29:21.451
Who the hell are you?

29:21.490 --> 29:23.412
I'm a friend of your mum's.

29:23.460 --> 29:25.189
I know what
you're trying to do.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.118
Lexi told me
everything.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.993
This is her aunt's apartment.

29:30.030 --> 29:32.362
Her aunt who's away
for the next few months.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.129
She gave you a key,

29:34.170 --> 29:35.967
you gave her
a license plate number

29:36.000 --> 29:38.833
that would lead any and all
interested parties to a man

29:38.870 --> 29:41.179
by the name of Grant Perryman.

29:41.210 --> 29:43.849
I know he's your father, Tess.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.302
He's not my father.

29:45.350 --> 29:47.045
He is.

29:47.080 --> 29:50.846
He just also happens to be
your mother's rapist.

29:53.490 --> 29:56.584
That must've been really hard
finding out.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.019
I'm sorry.

29:58.060 --> 30:01.120
Then go.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.320
And don't tell anyone
you found me.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.827
I can't.

30:09.170 --> 30:12.333
She was only a few
years older than me.

30:12.370 --> 30:15.498
She'd never even...

30:18.050 --> 30:22.009
He got her drunk at a party

30:22.050 --> 30:24.439
and he, uh...

30:24.490 --> 30:27.015
She was afraid.

30:27.050 --> 30:28.586
And stupid.

30:28.620 --> 30:30.508
I mean, she didn't tell anyone
for weeks.

30:30.560 --> 30:34.155
When she did, she
couldn't prove it.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.622
His parents were so rich,

30:35.660 --> 30:37.093
they offered a settlement
anyway.

30:37.130 --> 30:41.191
All my mother had to do
was keep her mouth shut.

30:42.670 --> 30:45.138
She did.

30:45.170 --> 30:47.638
She was so good at it,
she didn't even tell them

30:47.670 --> 30:50.878
when she found out
she was pregnant.

30:50.910 --> 30:53.504
That's why I didn't recognize
your picture the other day.

30:53.550 --> 30:55.108
How did you recognize him?

30:55.150 --> 30:57.618
Did my mom tell you?

30:57.650 --> 30:59.311
I have this friend.

30:59.350 --> 31:03.559
He has a habit of drilling
all sorts of facts into my head.

31:03.590 --> 31:06.229
Did you know, for example,

31:06.260 --> 31:11.129
that 0.4% of Caucasians have
brachydactyly type D thumbs.

31:11.170 --> 31:14.594
Also called clubbed thumbs.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.234
Of those, three quarters
have them on both hands.

31:17.270 --> 31:20.137
But I couldn't help noticing
in your pictures that

31:20.170 --> 31:24.209
you have a type D thumb
on your left hand only.

31:25.310 --> 31:27.574
Just like Grant Perryman.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.244
Your mum put everything
behind her,

31:33.290 --> 31:36.088
but you wanted to
dredge it all up again

31:36.120 --> 31:38.327
and force her to talk about it.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.157
To the press and to the police.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.499
Everyone would find out exactly
what kind of man he is.

31:42.530 --> 31:44.088
He deserves it.

31:44.130 --> 31:46.098
But your mum doesn't.

31:46.130 --> 31:49.236
What she went through
was terrible.

31:49.270 --> 31:52.262
It was unspeakable.

31:52.310 --> 31:55.199
But she chose to focus
on the good in her life.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.309
She chose you.

31:59.350 --> 32:03.275
And your mum wanted
to make sure...

32:03.320 --> 32:06.084
(crying)

32:15.160 --> 32:16.957
_ WATSON:
According to these memos,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.218
everything Barbara Conway
told us was true.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.068
The-the language
is deliberately vague

32:22.100 --> 32:25.069
and they never refer
to the cartel by name,

32:25.110 --> 32:26.566
but it's pretty obvious

32:26.610 --> 32:30.569
that AgriNext wanted Dubrovenslq
on the company payroll.

32:30.610 --> 32:32.578
Maybe we were wrong
about the murder.

32:32.610 --> 32:34.419
Maybe it really was the SDS.

32:34.450 --> 32:37.248
They wanted to burn him alive,

32:37.280 --> 32:40.044
but there was a struggle

32:40.090 --> 32:42.081
and he died from a blow
to the skull.

32:42.120 --> 32:45.226
But the killers still
had to sign their work.

32:45.260 --> 32:49.390
Utterly and
annoyingly possible.

32:49.430 --> 32:53.719
(sniffs)
Hmm. Why does it smell
like coffee and fish in here?

32:53.770 --> 32:56.136
Is that the plant food

32:56.170 --> 32:58.365
that Barbara Conway gave us?
The one that you said
would kill the orchid?

32:58.410 --> 33:02.528
Mm-hmm. While it might be
an annoyance to your senses,

33:02.580 --> 33:04.605
it is an onslaught to mine.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.210
I was hoping that the barrage
might trigger some new thoughts,

33:07.250 --> 33:09.468
but so far... mm.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.011
(sighs)

33:12.050 --> 33:15.383
We never finished our
conversation the other night.

33:15.420 --> 33:18.628
Yeah, you said you wanted
to make a change.

33:18.660 --> 33:22.494
You know how much
I value you.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.528
I've made that clear on...

33:25.570 --> 33:29.392
numerous occasions,
sometimes embarrassingly so.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.362
You've been a good friend

33:31.410 --> 33:34.072
and a good partner.

33:34.110 --> 33:36.078
It was you, in fact,

33:36.110 --> 33:38.408
that helped me understand
the concept of partnership,

33:38.450 --> 33:40.247
the value of it.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.669
Are you leaving New York again?

33:42.720 --> 33:44.483
No, quite the opposite.

33:44.520 --> 33:47.080
Mm. I don't understand.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.656
What is the change
you want to make?

33:48.690 --> 33:52.251
Kitty, I'm sure you'll agree,

33:52.290 --> 33:55.418
has made an excellent protge.

33:55.460 --> 34:00.227
But... I believe that
a matriculation is in order.

34:00.270 --> 34:04.309
So you want
to make Kitty your new partner.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.604
That she had the makings
of a detective

34:06.640 --> 34:08.505
was never in doubt.

34:08.540 --> 34:11.839
But I confess to having my
concerns regarding her history.

34:11.880 --> 34:16.510
The many... traumas
visited upon her.

34:16.550 --> 34:20.839
And I was certain that it would
take time to develop her.

34:20.890 --> 34:22.858
Years.

34:22.890 --> 34:25.279
I was wrong.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.286
Mostly thanks to you.

34:27.330 --> 34:30.458
Your instruction
has been crUCIal

34:30.500 --> 34:35.369
and, in certain areas,
more crucial than mine.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.789
I'm proud of her, Watson.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.638
I think she's ready.

34:40.670 --> 34:43.230
Wow.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.874
I, um...

34:45.910 --> 34:49.346
I'm happy for her. And you.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.689
I think it's
a great idea.

34:51.720 --> 34:55.349
(phone chimes)

34:58.390 --> 35:01.450
The other day you made reference
to the balance that we'd struck,

35:01.500 --> 35:04.469
your cases, my cases, our cases.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.627
This won't change that.
It's Marcus.

35:06.670 --> 35:09.537
He says they've got the guy
who killed the AgriNext execs.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.460
That tip about the rope
paid dividends.

35:13.510 --> 35:15.728
Marcus canvassed the shops
that sell it,

35:15.780 --> 35:17.873
and one of the owners
remembered this guy,

35:17.910 --> 35:20.799
Marco Gonalves, coming in
to buy a bunch of it.

35:20.850 --> 35:24.183
Security cameras outside the
store caught his license plate.

35:24.220 --> 35:26.142
We put
a FINEST message out,

35:26.190 --> 35:27.509
and a radio car got luclq.

35:27.550 --> 35:29.609
Now, the prints place him
at the AgriNext

35:29.660 --> 35:31.855
executives' murders.
So does the Witness.

35:31.890 --> 35:34.358
I take it from the
legal pad that he's
writing his confession.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.699
In addition to copping
to killing the AgriNext execs,

35:37.730 --> 35:40.164
he wants to take credit
for a dozen other hits.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.668
He's trying to maximize
his value to the SDS,

35:42.700 --> 35:44.839
absorb as many charges as he can

35:44.870 --> 35:46.804
since he already knows
he's going away for life.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.273
GREGSON:
But here's the thing,

35:48.310 --> 35:49.902
the only murder
he won't take the rap for

35:49.940 --> 35:51.771
is Clay Dubrovenslq's.

35:51.810 --> 35:54.472
BELL:
He does seem to have an idea
as to who did do it,

35:54.520 --> 35:55.919
but he won't give us a name.

35:55.950 --> 35:57.770
Best guess right now
is a rival cartel.

35:57.820 --> 36:01.312
Maybe they identified Sangue
do Sangue's grower in New York

36:01.360 --> 36:03.555
and killed him to mess
with their business.

36:03.590 --> 36:05.785
We'll keep you posted.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.189
You said the
other night

36:11.230 --> 36:13.721
that if another cartel
killed Dubrovenslq,

36:13.770 --> 36:15.761
they would have
signed their work.

36:15.800 --> 36:19.600
A cartel would.
A corporation would not.

36:19.640 --> 36:22.529
Take everything Barbara
Conway told us and flip it.

36:22.580 --> 36:25.378
Dubrovensky didn't tell
the SDS he wanted out

36:25.410 --> 36:26.877
of the deal--
he told AgriNext.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.377
They were the ones
who got angry.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.570
Perhaps they were worried
he knew too much.

36:30.620 --> 36:32.918
Or they didn't want to have
to compete with his weed

36:32.950 --> 36:35.384
further down the line.
Well, either way,

36:35.420 --> 36:37.752
they framed the SDS
and the cartel retaliated.

36:37.790 --> 36:40.281
Immolating two of the
top brass and leaving them

36:40.330 --> 36:42.252
on an AgriNext lawn.
(phone chimes)

36:42.300 --> 36:45.792
I propose another conversation
with Ms. Conway.

36:45.830 --> 36:48.492
If she wasn't part of
what happened, perhaps
she can tell us who was.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.930
Did you give Dubrovenslq's
ex-girlfriend my number?

36:51.970 --> 36:53.904
You know I don't like
to give out my own.

36:53.940 --> 36:55.931
Well, she wants to talk.
Says it's important.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.800
A case of the
munchies, perhaps.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.604
You go. I'll
locate Ms. Conway.

37:00.650 --> 37:02.845
Hey.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.246
I wasn't sure you'd come.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.747
Why'd you want me
to meet you here?

37:07.790 --> 37:09.382
The super
lives next door,

37:09.420 --> 37:10.956
only he won't let me
into Clay's apartment

37:10.990 --> 37:13.379
unless someone
from the department Signs off.

37:13.430 --> 37:16.729
And why do you want
to go inside Clay's apartment?

37:17.760 --> 37:20.024
Clay gave me this.

37:20.070 --> 37:22.538
He made _it.
He grew it.

37:22.570 --> 37:24.333
It's a yellow clivia.

37:24.370 --> 37:27.601
When you texted me,
you said it was important.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.005
He used to give me special food.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.031
Even after we broke up.
He made it himself.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.741
And it's
inside.

37:32.780 --> 37:36.409
I thought that maybe
if you spoke to the super...

37:38.080 --> 37:40.583
You must think I'm an idiot,

37:40.620 --> 37:43.054
starting up again with a guy
who cheated on me,

37:43.090 --> 37:45.888
getting sentimental
about a flower

37:45.930 --> 37:46.919
he gave me.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.895
Well, I'm not here to judge you.

37:49.930 --> 37:54.060
You know what
the really stupid thing is?

37:54.100 --> 37:56.864
Is that he gave these
to all the girls.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.561
What do you mean?

37:58.610 --> 38:00.566
Girls he was
sleeping with.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.976
He would give them
a yellow clivia.

38:03.010 --> 38:04.648
Just like mine.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.604
Mmm.
It was, like,
his move.

38:07.650 --> 38:09.675
He told me that when we
started hooking up again.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.984
I probably should've been mad,
but we weren't back together,

38:12.020 --> 38:14.955
you know? I actually thought
it was kind of funny.

38:14.990 --> 38:16.389
(phone chimes)

38:22.060 --> 38:22.856
Foundit

38:22.900 --> 38:25.994
Plant food.

38:26.030 --> 38:27.861
Like I told you,

38:27.900 --> 38:29.891
it's gross.
It smells like coffee and...

38:29.940 --> 38:33.000
Fish.
It's Clay's
special recipe.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.076
Made just for the clivia.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.601
(phone ringing)

38:42.380 --> 38:44.018
Watson.

38:44.050 --> 38:46.644
Hey. Barbara Conway's coming
to the station tomorrow?

38:46.690 --> 38:48.385
Yes.

38:48.420 --> 38:50.809
She claims to have no knowledge
of an AgriNext conspiracy

38:50.860 --> 38:52.384
to kill Dubrovenslq,

38:52.430 --> 38:55.024
but she has a few ideas
as to who might.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.051
That's because you were right
all along.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.921
She's the one who did it.

39:07.110 --> 39:09.078
Please
take a seat.

39:09.110 --> 39:12.443
Is Mr. Holmes coming?

39:12.480 --> 39:15.369
No. It's just us today.

39:18.520 --> 39:21.114
He caught me off guard
last night.

39:21.150 --> 39:25.723
This idea that someone from
AgriNext may have killed Clay.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.126
But... the more
I thought about it,

39:28.160 --> 39:29.718
the more I wondered.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.558
The company's been accused
of much worse.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.636
Usually overseas but still...

39:34.670 --> 39:35.989
I know it was you, Barbara.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.689
Excuse me?

39:37.740 --> 39:39.935
I know you killed Clay.

39:39.970 --> 39:42.632
When you gave us the
orchid the other day,

39:42.680 --> 39:46.468
you accidentally included
some food for a yellow clivia,

39:46.510 --> 39:49.411
a very special one
that Clay gave you.

39:49.450 --> 39:50.815
The two of you
were involved.

39:50.850 --> 39:52.989
I don't see
how that has anything to do

39:53.020 --> 39:55.682
with what you're...
I don't think you
planned to kill him.

39:55.720 --> 39:56.948
That's important.

39:56.990 --> 39:58.958
You realized he was sleeping
with his ex,

39:58.990 --> 40:00.685
and you confronted him.

40:00.730 --> 40:02.550
But it didn't go well.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.728
I think I should call my lawyer.

40:05.770 --> 40:08.432
You could, but
I wouldn't.

40:08.470 --> 40:09.994
He'll tell you to leave.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.964
And this is your one,
best chance to show contrition,

40:13.010 --> 40:14.739
to try and make
people understand

40:14.780 --> 40:16.202
that you did not
mean to kill Clay

40:16.240 --> 40:19.073
or the Kelleys.

40:21.720 --> 40:22.914
Like I said,
I don't think

40:22.950 --> 40:24.178
you went to Clay's that night

40:24.220 --> 40:26.188
with the intention
of killing him.

40:26.220 --> 40:29.678
You didn't show up
with a hollowed-out tire,

40:29.720 --> 40:31.722
which means you had
to go out and get one

40:31.760 --> 40:33.455
right after
it happened.

40:33.490 --> 40:35.890
Now, my colleagues
are combing the area

40:35.930 --> 40:37.727
around Clay's
apartment right now.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.694
It is only a
matter of time

40:39.730 --> 40:41.698
before someone
recognizes your picture.

40:41.740 --> 40:45.198
Now, they know I'm talking
to you right now, Barbara.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.561
So the longer
you wait

40:47.610 --> 40:49.771
and the more you make them work
for this,

40:49.810 --> 40:52.449
the harder it's gonna be
for you.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.219
I kept it.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.854
The clivia.

41:05.890 --> 41:09.155
I know how crazy
that sounds, but...

41:09.200 --> 41:12.021
I loved him.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.865
HOLMES:
Would it have been
more satisfying

41:16.900 --> 41:19.664
to eviscerate a corporate
behemoth? Unquestionably.

41:19.710 --> 41:22.133
But the true killer
has confessed. We can ask
for little more.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.875
I know. It's just...
You're doing that wrong.

41:23.910 --> 41:25.844
S-Sorry.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.713
It's, uh... Kitty's agreed
to take part in an exercise.

41:28.750 --> 41:32.186
Have you told her about the,
uh, matriculation yet?

41:32.220 --> 41:34.711
No. But it is on today's agenda.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.786
Well, I'm working
at Leda today, so...

41:37.820 --> 41:39.651
maybe I'll come by
with some pizzas

41:39.690 --> 41:42.193
and offer my congratulations
in person.

41:42.230 --> 41:43.822
(phone chimes)

41:43.860 --> 41:45.896
The captain's calling me.
Do you wish to hold?

41:45.930 --> 41:49.696
No. Take it. I'll see you later.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.560
Captain.

41:51.610 --> 41:54.579
A body just turned up.
I need you at the scene.

41:54.610 --> 41:56.032
Right, we'll leave immediately.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.640
No. Just you.

42:02.880 --> 42:05.940
Her name is Melanie
Vilkas. 24 years old.

42:05.990 --> 42:09.209
She went missing
a few days ago.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.922
Whoever took her kept her
alive until last night

42:11.960 --> 42:13.951
and then he
dumped her.

42:13.990 --> 42:17.926
And the reason
I couldn't bring Kitty with me?

42:17.960 --> 42:20.929
Take a look
at her back.

42:26.910 --> 42:28.639
They're the same markings

42:28.680 --> 42:31.137
_ I saw in those
files you gave me,

42:31.180 --> 42:34.308
the same ones
that are on Kitty's back.

42:34.350 --> 42:37.046
So the man who hurt her
is here in New York.

42:41.890 --> 42:42.879
