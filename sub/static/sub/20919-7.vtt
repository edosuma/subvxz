WEBVTT

00:03.295 --> 00:06.363
[Ant-Man]
Ah. Another day at the office.

00:06.398 --> 00:08.773
Lights are on,
but no one's home?

00:08.809 --> 00:10.775
[panting]

00:10.811 --> 00:12.210
[grunting]

00:14.873 --> 00:16.740
[soft whirring]

00:16.775 --> 00:18.215
That's one doozy
of a security drone.

00:24.582 --> 00:26.817
Whoa.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.352
Uh, Avengers, I'm responding
to a distress call

00:29.387 --> 00:32.147
from somebody trapped
on the 20th floor.

00:32.182 --> 00:34.336
But the place looks completely locked down.
No life readings anywhere.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.369
[Vision over radio] Ant-Man,
if you require assistance,

00:37.446 --> 00:39.846
we can reach your coordinates
in 10.3 minutes.

00:39.881 --> 00:41.790
Thanks, Vision.
But nothing here I can't handle.

00:41.825 --> 00:44.426
I'll call you if I need help.
[grunts]

00:44.462 --> 00:47.145
Oh, what do we have here?
Somebody's eyelash?

00:47.180 --> 00:49.989
Or nose hair? [Chuckles]

00:50.025 --> 00:51.377
And with my luck,
it's probably a nose hair.

00:51.401 --> 00:53.977
[grunts]

00:54.012 --> 00:56.129
Quality rubber hand.

00:56.164 --> 00:57.584
This place gets
the nice office supplies.

00:57.608 --> 01:00.092
[grunting]

01:03.614 --> 01:06.131
Oh! Whoop!

01:06.166 --> 01:08.058
[grunts, laughs]

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.691 --> 01:24.407
Man, I'm good.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.171
Distress call came
from around here.

01:30.207 --> 01:33.250
But the inner doors won't open
unless I shut down security.

01:35.454 --> 01:36.903
[knuckles crack]

01:36.938 --> 01:38.405
[keyboard clacking] Wow!

01:38.440 --> 01:40.748
This place is not
kidding around.

01:40.784 --> 01:42.412
Most advanced security setup
I've ever seen.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.170
[beeping]

01:45.205 --> 01:48.148
DNA scan? You don't want my DNA.

01:48.183 --> 01:50.267
Here, computer.
Take this one instead.

01:56.058 --> 01:58.007
[chuckling] Hey, I didn't die.

01:58.043 --> 02:00.777
[beeping] Nice!

02:09.095 --> 02:12.764
Panther statues?
An old-world map?

02:12.800 --> 02:15.884
This is all stuff from Wakanda.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.387
Black Panther, someone stole a bunch
of your stuff and put it here.

02:18.389 --> 02:21.014
But don't worry. I'm on it.
As soon as I find...

02:21.091 --> 02:23.002
[trilling] This is a
top-secret Wakandan building

02:23.026 --> 02:25.760
guarded by our most
advanced security.

02:25.795 --> 02:28.905
How did you get in here?
By, uh, being me?

02:28.940 --> 02:30.907
[beeping]

02:30.942 --> 02:34.353
Something is wrong.

02:34.388 --> 02:37.108
The building's wired to blow! But
don't worry. I think I've got th...

02:59.396 --> 03:01.979
Well, that's a first. Instead of
the Avengers saving the world,

03:02.015 --> 03:04.307
the world saved the Avengers.

03:04.342 --> 03:06.159
[Black Panther]
We must go to Wakanda.

03:06.194 --> 03:07.954
There is no time to stop
back at the mansion.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.483
I will be in Wakanda shortly.

03:13.518 --> 03:15.018
Prepare for my arrival.

03:16.772 --> 03:19.947
Mm.

03:19.983 --> 03:23.401
Oh, come on. You know I'm not
a thief anymore. I'm a hero.

03:23.436 --> 03:25.778
You were trespassing
inside my building.

03:25.814 --> 03:28.615
Yeah, I admit it.
That sounds bad.

03:28.650 --> 03:32.502
The individual who faked that
distress call used your skills.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.257
Now they know how to defeat
the national security

03:34.281 --> 03:37.432
of Wakanda itself,
thanks to you.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.609
Okay, I messed up.
But how was I supposed to know?

03:39.644 --> 03:43.412
The building didn't exactly say
"Wakanda" on the outside.

03:43.448 --> 03:46.382
Why would I advertise
Wakanda on the building?

03:46.417 --> 03:48.835
People need not know
about Wakandan matters,

03:48.870 --> 03:51.062
nor take advantage of them.

03:51.097 --> 03:53.657
I prefer
to keep things discreet.

03:53.692 --> 03:58.203
You and me both. I'd rather people
not know I used to be a thief,

03:58.239 --> 04:00.413
and that I was the one
who cracked your security,

04:00.449 --> 04:01.792
and that I got played
like a sucker.

04:01.816 --> 04:03.908
Look, I'm sorry about all this.

04:03.943 --> 04:07.379
Hmm. Apology accepted.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.349
But you would be wise to stay
quiet about what you did.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.385
In Wakanda, the penalties
for your actions would be bad.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.019
Bad, like... death?

04:16.055 --> 04:18.290
Worse than death.

04:18.325 --> 04:21.059
[uneasy chuckle]

04:21.095 --> 04:22.794
I can never tell
if you're joking or not.

04:26.824 --> 04:28.166
Whoa!

04:28.201 --> 04:30.093
Wakanda!

04:37.343 --> 04:39.502
[Black Panther]
There have been no reports

04:39.537 --> 04:42.088
of intruders
within Wakandan borders.

04:42.124 --> 04:44.749
If we hurry, we may prevent your
mistake from becoming a disaster.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.043
[whirring]

04:47.079 --> 04:49.178
Ooh. Are those
tamper-resistant cameras?

04:49.213 --> 04:53.324
You ask me questions like that, and you
wonder why people still see you as a thief.

04:53.359 --> 04:56.502
Hey, I'm not gonna
break in to your palace.

04:56.538 --> 04:59.080
I'm not that guy anymore. You
know, every day, [whirring]

04:59.115 --> 05:01.449
I fight like crazy to prove...
Get down!

05:01.484 --> 05:03.668
Okay, sorry I mentioned it!

05:06.439 --> 05:09.240
What? The system
has been compromised.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.926
Can you turn it off? We will have
to shut it down... manually.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.638
[grunting]

05:19.110 --> 05:20.852
[grunting]

05:29.880 --> 05:30.880
[grunts]

05:30.914 --> 05:31.914
[screams]

05:33.750 --> 05:34.991
[chuckles] Whew.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.662
[clapping] [male voice] Oh, yes!

05:38.697 --> 05:41.239
Yes! Very good.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.800
Your efforts
are most entertaining,

05:43.835 --> 05:45.818
but ultimately futile.

05:45.854 --> 05:48.354
We aim to please.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.231
So, just who is it
that we're pleasing?

05:50.266 --> 05:52.601
Baron Zemo.

05:52.636 --> 05:54.869
The Avengers have dealt
with him before.

05:54.904 --> 05:58.197
Zemo's father once attempted
to invade Wakanda,

05:58.233 --> 06:01.084
but he was thwarted
by my father, King T'Chaka.

06:01.119 --> 06:04.220
His father failed, as will Zemo.
[grunts]

06:04.255 --> 06:06.798
[grunts, chuckles]

06:06.833 --> 06:10.702
I am not my father.
I am his better.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.246
And I have been
vastly more successful.

06:13.282 --> 06:17.658
Thanks to Ant-Man, I now control not
only your palace security systems,

06:17.694 --> 06:20.753
but those for
your entire nation.

06:20.789 --> 06:25.032
You will know defeat, and you
will know my true genius.

06:25.068 --> 06:28.128
Now watch as Wakandan security
carries out my orders.

06:32.650 --> 06:34.334
The drones are headed
for the city!

06:34.369 --> 06:36.386
[evil chuckling]

06:47.991 --> 06:49.649
That is some serious road rage.

06:52.696 --> 06:59.885
Please, clear the area
as expediently as possible.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.856
Hey, you heard the king! Everybody run
for the hills [citizens clamoring]

07:01.880 --> 07:03.237
[panting]

07:03.272 --> 07:05.773
[grunts]

07:05.808 --> 07:07.167
[grunts] [drone clatters]

07:09.779 --> 07:13.331
You hungry?
Have a knuckle sandwich!

07:13.366 --> 07:14.957
[grunts] [tires screech]

07:14.993 --> 07:17.644
Black Panther built these
security drones to be tough.

07:17.679 --> 07:18.919
But they're not indestructible.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.851
[grunts] [grunting]

07:31.100 --> 07:35.795
I am loathe to destroy my workmanship...
[grunting]

07:35.831 --> 07:38.198
But they were due
for an upgrade anyway.

07:39.768 --> 07:41.942
[Ant-Man] Hey! Over here!

07:41.978 --> 07:44.037
Thousand bonus points
if you hit the Ant-Man!

07:51.696 --> 07:52.696
Whoa!

07:54.724 --> 07:56.716
[grunting]

07:59.395 --> 08:01.179
[yelling]

08:02.598 --> 08:05.842
Uh-oh. End of the road.

08:05.877 --> 08:09.128
I was lying
about the bonus points.

08:09.163 --> 08:12.031
But you knew that, right?
[yells]

08:12.067 --> 08:13.816
[crying out]

08:15.946 --> 08:17.970
[crying out]

08:18.006 --> 08:19.798
Ant-Man, hold on!

08:19.833 --> 08:22.825
[grunting]

08:22.860 --> 08:26.671
I'm... calling in...
the air... cavalry!

08:26.706 --> 08:27.706
[yells] [buzzing]

08:32.578 --> 08:36.489
[yells, grunts]

08:36.524 --> 08:38.808
Oh, I thought
I was a goner there.

08:38.842 --> 08:41.910
It could still happen. Duck!

08:41.946 --> 08:45.331
This final drone is completely
out of control.

08:45.366 --> 08:48.051
It will not be as easy
as the others to defeat.

08:48.086 --> 08:49.844
Wait. You call
those other ones easy?

08:49.879 --> 08:52.547
[grunts]

08:52.582 --> 08:54.382
Get one of your throwing
blade thingies ready.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.823
Don't miss. [Grunts]

09:01.858 --> 09:04.817
Man, how does he have
such perfect aim?

09:04.852 --> 09:06.911
[grunts]

09:15.379 --> 09:17.213
Ant-Man! [Grunting]

09:21.703 --> 09:23.261
That was highly impressive.

09:24.956 --> 09:28.308
I'm just full of surprises.

09:28.343 --> 09:30.676
[Black Panther] All security
systems are offline,

09:30.712 --> 09:32.770
and Baron Zemo has managed
to elude the Dora Milaje.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.106
What could Zemo be after?

09:35.141 --> 09:37.375
The palace is filled
with rare Vibranium,

09:37.411 --> 09:40.136
advanced technology,
immense treasures.

09:40.171 --> 09:42.030
Your Highness,
we have found something.

09:44.559 --> 09:46.542
[whistles] Heavy-duty door.

09:46.577 --> 09:48.944
Maintain watch up here.

09:48.980 --> 09:53.491
We do not want any more
unpleasant surprises.

09:53.526 --> 09:57.027
The current Wakandan palace lies above
the ruins of the former palace,

09:57.063 --> 10:00.949
which was fashioned directly over
our original Vibranium mines.

10:00.984 --> 10:03.960
The mines are off limits
by order of my father.

10:03.995 --> 10:06.154
There are
ancient traps everywhere.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.881
Proceed with caution.

10:08.917 --> 10:12.444
So, what's down there
that's so important?

10:12.520 --> 10:16.080
I do not know. My father
never told me the secret.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.999
The bigger the secrets,
the bigger the trouble.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.060
[clanging] Move!

10:20.095 --> 10:22.837
[yells]
Huh. "Proceed with caution."

10:22.872 --> 10:25.072
[chuckles] Gotcha.

10:25.108 --> 10:27.450
Zemo's dad tried
to attack Wakanda.

10:27.485 --> 10:31.412
What did Zemo Sr. Want? He was
seeking something of great power.

10:31.448 --> 10:33.564
That was all my father told me.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.499
Oh. Wait. Wait. See this?

10:35.535 --> 10:37.568
Perfect place for a trap.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.003
See how the chamber narrows?

10:41.082 --> 10:43.624
Called it! [Chuckles]

10:43.660 --> 10:46.135
Do I know my stuff, or do
I know my st... [yells]

10:48.140 --> 10:50.473
[straining]

10:51.834 --> 10:53.142
[grunts]

10:55.321 --> 10:57.647
[grunting]

11:00.318 --> 11:01.717
[both yell]

11:01.753 --> 11:02.944
[grunts]

11:06.057 --> 11:07.707
[yells]

11:07.742 --> 11:10.242
You sure these traps
are ancient?

11:10.278 --> 11:12.311
They look kind of cutting edge.

11:12.347 --> 11:14.330
[grunts]

11:14.365 --> 11:18.400
Oh, come on. "Cutting edge"?
That doesn't get a laugh?

11:18.436 --> 11:22.222
Scott, I can tolerate your bad
jokes, and I am at peace with that,

11:22.257 --> 11:24.465
but please do not
ask me to laugh at them.

11:26.161 --> 11:28.386
Well, okay.
Since you said "please."

11:35.361 --> 11:37.395
Interesting.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.398
The entire gauntlet
is a near perfect match

11:40.434 --> 11:42.500
to the myth
of the curious jackal,

11:42.536 --> 11:45.269
a Wakandan folktale,
which would mean...

11:45.304 --> 11:47.196
Follow my lead.

11:55.390 --> 11:57.331
[grunts]

12:01.680 --> 12:03.390
[Ant-Man] I don't know
your curious jackal myth,

12:03.414 --> 12:05.515
but I guess it ends
with a giant crocodile,

12:05.550 --> 12:08.768
like that one there? Yes,
but it does not make sense.

12:08.803 --> 12:11.529
All these death traps...

12:11.564 --> 12:13.025
How did Baron Zemo get beyond all of this?
[water splashes]

12:13.049 --> 12:15.349
Alas, I did not.

12:15.385 --> 12:18.811
Instead,
I have been following you,

12:18.846 --> 12:21.898
permitting you to disarm the
traps and lead me to my prize.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.116
[Black Panther] It is
supposed to be only a myth...

12:32.152 --> 12:34.235
The Amulet
of the Crocodile Spirit.

12:34.270 --> 12:37.071
And to think decades ago,

12:37.107 --> 12:40.491
our fathers battled
over this very amulet.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.852
Ah. [Laughs]

12:42.887 --> 12:47.765
So powerful and unpredictable that
it nearly destroyed them both.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.018
The only way to save themselves
was to work together,

12:50.020 --> 12:52.795
to overcome the amulet
with the power of a Wakandan

12:52.830 --> 12:55.006
and an outsider combined.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.616
My father never
told me any of this.

12:57.652 --> 13:00.302
What is it with Wakandans
and keeping secrets?

13:00.338 --> 13:02.504
It's like a national pastime
or something.

13:02.540 --> 13:07.176
Our fathers agreed to a truce and
left it here, never to be used again.

13:07.212 --> 13:09.746
But I am stronger.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.948
I will harness its power
where my father failed.

13:12.983 --> 13:15.409
[Ant-Man] You never
said "thanks." What?

13:15.444 --> 13:18.512
Come on, Baron Zemo.
I got you into Wakanda.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.856
I got you into here.
You used me twice.

13:20.891 --> 13:22.800
Least you could do
is say "thank you."

13:22.835 --> 13:26.721
Oh. Yes. Where are my manners?

13:26.723 --> 13:29.590
Please, allow me to express
my deepest gratitude.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.744
[grunting]

13:33.780 --> 13:35.137
[yells]

13:37.633 --> 13:38.633
Yoink!

13:40.436 --> 13:43.237
No! The amulet is mine!

13:43.273 --> 13:44.397
[both grunt]

13:50.546 --> 13:52.613
[Black Panther]
According to the myth,

13:52.648 --> 13:54.874
no one can control
the evil crocodile spirit.

13:54.909 --> 13:57.209
It will feed off
your desire for power,

13:57.244 --> 13:59.645
twist you, control you.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.897
[scoffs]
It dominates weaker beings.

14:01.933 --> 14:04.809
Not me. Not Zemo.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.836
[laughing]

14:10.049 --> 14:12.967
Huh? [Groaning]
[electricity buzzing]

14:15.747 --> 14:18.622
[Ant-Man] I have this sudden
urge to run away screaming.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.400
What is happening?

14:21.436 --> 14:25.179
The crocodile spirit has
overtaken Zemo's body and mind,

14:25.214 --> 14:28.766
taking the worst parts of him,
transforming him into a monster.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.334
[groans]

14:30.369 --> 14:33.070
[grunting]

14:37.068 --> 14:38.951
[both grunting]

14:44.091 --> 14:46.975
[grunting]

14:47.011 --> 14:48.745
He is somehow
controlling the Vibranium.

14:48.780 --> 14:51.047
[electricity buzzing] [groaning]

14:53.342 --> 14:54.800
But unable to control himself.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.494
[blow lands]

14:57.530 --> 14:58.930
[grunts]

15:06.297 --> 15:09.248
[grunts]

15:09.283 --> 15:11.984
[roaring]

15:25.191 --> 15:26.740
Oh, boy.

15:26.775 --> 15:28.775
[grunts]

15:28.811 --> 15:31.245
[thudding]

15:31.281 --> 15:33.623
It's one thing taking on
something that size,

15:33.658 --> 15:35.758
another thing
when he's that strong.

15:35.793 --> 15:38.386
You once were able
to grow to that size.

15:38.421 --> 15:41.881
No! I mean, I used to go
giant, but not anymore.

15:41.916 --> 15:44.083
It got ugly bad.

15:44.118 --> 15:46.385
Besides, I've got an idea.
Come on!

15:46.420 --> 15:48.670
[grunts]

15:48.706 --> 15:50.848
[grunts]

15:50.883 --> 15:52.667
[yells]

15:52.702 --> 15:56.412
[roaring]

15:56.447 --> 15:58.839
If we can't hit Zemo,
we hit the amulet.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.908
I'm gonna try
and get it away from him.

16:00.944 --> 16:03.110
Do it.
I will draw his attention.

16:03.145 --> 16:04.937
[yells]

16:04.973 --> 16:07.757
[grunts]

16:07.792 --> 16:10.275
Zemo! Down here! Do you see me?

16:10.311 --> 16:12.569
[grunts]

16:12.605 --> 16:14.730
I think he sees me.

16:14.765 --> 16:15.923
[trilling]

16:23.683 --> 16:25.549
[straining]

16:25.584 --> 16:28.410
Uh-oh.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.622
[grunts] This isn't going
how I thought it would.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.774
[grunting]

16:37.121 --> 16:39.755
[groaning]

16:39.790 --> 16:42.149
[roaring]

16:42.184 --> 16:43.584
[grunts]

16:43.620 --> 16:45.252
[both grunt]

16:45.287 --> 16:47.229
According to the myth,

16:47.264 --> 16:49.674
unstable energies
are building within Zemo.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.101
If Zemo is unable
to control the energies,

16:52.137 --> 16:55.613
he could combust,
taking the entire city with him.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.965
I know your dad didn't
tell you about the amulet,

16:58.000 --> 16:59.967
but is there something
we can do against it?

17:00.002 --> 17:02.778
Is there a weakness? If
there is, I do not know it.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.047
Of course.
No one tells anyone anything,

17:05.082 --> 17:06.840
because they don't
wanna lose face.

17:06.876 --> 17:09.435
You used to be able
to grow giant.

17:09.470 --> 17:12.070
If you could match Zemo's size,
that could make the difference.

17:12.106 --> 17:15.040
When I go giant, I pass out.

17:15.076 --> 17:18.042
Then I wake up drooling. I don't
even know if I can do it anymore.

17:18.079 --> 17:22.289
I see. You do not wish
to lose face.

17:22.325 --> 17:25.617
We do not have much time. If you
can still do it, do it quickly.

17:27.597 --> 17:29.163
Here goes nothing.

17:30.475 --> 17:33.309
[grunting]

17:33.344 --> 17:34.651
[roaring]

17:34.687 --> 17:36.378
[grunting]

17:38.449 --> 17:39.974
Zemo!

17:40.009 --> 17:43.602
You cannot control it.
[growling]

17:43.638 --> 17:47.239
Your hunger for its power will destroy
you and thousands of innocents.

17:47.275 --> 17:50.902
[growls] No, Black Panther.

17:50.978 --> 17:54.822
See how I wield the power,
how it belongs to me!

17:54.858 --> 17:56.998
[crying out]

17:57.034 --> 17:58.734
Your suit is made of Vibranium.

17:58.769 --> 18:04.039
Now I control the Vibranium,
which means I control you!

18:04.075 --> 18:06.008
[crying out]

18:06.043 --> 18:08.502
[straining]

18:08.538 --> 18:09.929

18:09.964 --> 18:12.197
[Ant-Man] Oh, Zemo!

[yelling]

18:17.154 --> 18:19.563
[grunts]

18:19.599 --> 18:21.874
I'm here to tell jokes
and kick butt.

18:21.909 --> 18:23.759
And I'm all out of jokes.

18:23.794 --> 18:25.236
Thank goodness.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.762
[yelling]

18:56.260 --> 18:58.702
[growling]

18:58.738 --> 19:02.081
Try to entangle him!
Oh, easy for you to say.

19:02.116 --> 19:03.732
No excuses.
You can do this, Scott.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.468

T'Challa, I'm losing it!
I can't hold him!

19:25.873 --> 19:28.533

19:28.568 --> 19:30.550
What Zemo said...

19:30.586 --> 19:32.461
Scott, I cannot do this alone!

19:32.496 --> 19:36.799
This requires a Wakandan
and an outsider together!

19:36.834 --> 19:40.027
Grab the amulet! Hurry!

19:40.063 --> 19:42.554
We are out of time!

19:42.589 --> 19:45.140

[electricity stops buzzing]

19:54.176 --> 19:55.501
No! [Grunts]

19:55.536 --> 19:56.902
[electricity buzzing resumes]

19:56.938 --> 20:00.105
[screaming]

20:04.771 --> 20:06.770
Ant-Man! Can you hear me?

20:06.805 --> 20:08.197
Scott!

20:09.967 --> 20:13.110
Huh? Wh-What? Huh?

20:13.145 --> 20:17.098
Hey, buddy,
I, uh, found your thing.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.249
[Baron Zemo groaning]

20:24.481 --> 20:26.423
Don't tell anyone
I drooled, okay?

20:28.218 --> 20:30.352
Come on, guys. Careful.

20:30.388 --> 20:33.447
That stuff's expensive. I got
a reputation to look out for.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.684
[trilling]

20:36.719 --> 20:38.711
[Vision] We received
your most recent file.

20:38.746 --> 20:40.579
I believe this is
the most detailed report

20:40.615 --> 20:42.748
you've ever submitted
from Wakanda.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.825
Well, in the past,
I had reason to keep information

20:44.860 --> 20:47.018
within Wakandan borders.

20:47.054 --> 20:49.363
But I am through
with keeping too many secrets.

20:49.398 --> 20:53.083
Ah, too many secrets,
too many problems.

20:53.119 --> 20:56.720
Inform the other Avengers we will
be in Wakanda for a few more days.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.725
Ant-Man is helping me repair
and redesign national security.

20:58.749 --> 21:02.359
Is that wise? After
all, he is an ex-felon.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.277
Hey! Come on, man!

21:04.313 --> 21:07.573
[laughing]

21:07.608 --> 21:09.508
And now even the android's
making fun of me.

21:09.544 --> 21:11.811
I so don't deserve this.

21:11.887 --> 21:14.330
You never did tell me
what you did with the amulet.

21:14.365 --> 21:17.341
I put it somewhere safe.
Somewhere only I know.

21:17.376 --> 21:20.277
Ah. You are not
going to tell me?

21:20.313 --> 21:23.222
Whatever happened to "too many
secrets, too many problems"?

21:23.257 --> 21:25.191
Nope, not tellin' anyone.

21:25.226 --> 21:27.067
Hmm?

21:27.103 --> 21:29.786
Eh, I'll tell you later.
