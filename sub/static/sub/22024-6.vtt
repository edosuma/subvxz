WEBVTT

00:00.942 --> 00:02.601
Yo! Get that nigga
off you, Touie!

00:02.636 --> 00:03.469
Shut up! Stop it!

00:07.008 --> 00:08.574
Touie ain't here
no more 'cause of him.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.909
-Kill him.
-You're broken.

00:10.945 --> 00:12.778
Did you come here
to recruit me?

00:12.813 --> 00:13.812
I just need
a cryptographer.

00:13.848 --> 00:16.056
-You're a fucking user, Izzy.
-Stella.

00:16.091 --> 00:19.385
-What the hell is this?
-That's the offer from Monica.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.719
I got an idea.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.554
About the cipher.
How to steal it.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.522
It's corporate espionage.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.791
What took them so long?

00:25.826 --> 00:26.859
What are you
gonna do with her?

00:26.894 --> 00:29.361
She's just fixing
what she broke.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.496
Phil?
Yeah?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.965
-You can go.
-Sure.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.066
Whatever you're
gonna do, I wasn't here.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.002
We're in.

00:37.038 --> 00:39.438
I'm gonna finish
the network patch in Greenwich.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.072
We're done here.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:13.332 --> 01:14.331
Let's go.

01:14.366 --> 01:15.632
Easy, easy.

01:15.667 --> 01:16.066
-Don't touch me.
-Shut up.

01:51.661 --> 01:53.461
Don't move.

01:57.567 --> 01:58.066
Misha!

02:19.280 --> 02:21.647
Gavril.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.615
-Hands.
-All right, all right.

02:22.650 --> 02:25.485
Hands! I'm calling this off.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.419
We're all going home.

02:26.454 --> 02:28.988
Easy. Calm down.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.456
I need you to lay
your weapon on the ground.

02:30.492 --> 02:32.692
Hands on your head.

02:32.727 --> 02:34.827
Now
you're arresting us?

02:34.863 --> 02:36.329
You're not leaving me
much choice.

02:37.966 --> 02:39.665
Tell whoever's in that car
to get out now.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.176
I thought it was set?

02:41.211 --> 02:43.669
Why have you still got
the gun in your hand, Gavril?

02:43.705 --> 02:44.971
No, listen to me. Listen to me.

02:45.006 --> 02:47.740
Does Vera know
you're doing this?

02:47.776 --> 02:49.601
-You know...
-This isn't Vera.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.036
This is my call. Now tell him!

02:52.673 --> 02:54.573
Get out of the goddamn car now!

02:54.608 --> 02:55.273
Hey!

03:14.328 --> 03:15.060
Shit.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.068
Goddamn. Goddamn it.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.070
Goddamn it.

03:59.464 --> 04:01.564
-Izzy.
-Untie me.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.732
Untie me.
I can't move.

04:02.768 --> 04:04.534
-Phil, untie me. Untie me.
-Wait.

04:04.569 --> 04:05.602
Phil!
I got a knife.

04:05.637 --> 04:06.069
I got a knife.
Untie me.

04:08.673 --> 04:09.072
There we go, okay.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.033
-Untie me.
-Okay.

04:48.304 --> 04:49.070
My gun!

05:39.573 --> 05:40.572
Izzy, pull over. Izzy...

05:40.607 --> 05:42.040
-What?
-Pull the car over.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.744
Phil. Phil.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.579
I'm gonna take you
to a hospital.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.681
Izzy, you gotta pull over.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.124
-No.
-Izzy, you gotta pull over.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.194
What... what... Why? -You can't
take me to the hospital.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.555
If you take me to the hospital,
the cops will get involved.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.890
If the cops get involved,

05:58.925 --> 06:00.225
you might as well tell Vera
where you are.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.327
Okay?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.595
I got this.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.563
You pull over. You get out.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.598
You just gotta run, Izzy.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.666
-No. No.
-You've gotta run.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.067
-No! No!
-I can do this, okay?

06:10.245 --> 06:12.112
What are you gonna do? -I'm
gonna drive to the hospital.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.340
I will drive myself
to the hospital.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.032
You get out.

06:17.202 --> 06:18.034
No.

06:20.739 --> 06:22.038
Izzy, pull over.
I'm gonna drive.

06:24.642 --> 06:26.476
Izzy, pull over!

06:26.511 --> 06:27.643
Pull over now.
Okay.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.679
-Pull over.
-Okay, okay, okay.

06:29.714 --> 06:30.046
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.053
Iz... Isabelle...

06:40.492 --> 06:41.257
I can drive the car.

06:44.462 --> 06:45.061
I need you to go.

08:20.275 --> 08:22.033
Hey.

08:23.370 --> 08:24.035
Hey, I...

08:25.672 --> 08:27.038
I had a box put on hold for me.

08:29.642 --> 08:33.044
-What's your name?
-Michelle.

08:57.303 --> 08:58.069
Hello?

09:00.273 --> 09:03.007
Izzy?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.033
Slow down! You wanna
get pulled over by the cops?

09:05.636 --> 09:07.345
-Maybe.
-I need your phone.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.638
I think that would be a very good idea.
We should go to the police.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.807
We can't!
That's what he said.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.809
No cops!
You trust him all of a sudden?

09:13.845 --> 09:17.747
Yes! Yes, he just saved
my life, Nick!

09:17.782 --> 09:19.315
If we go to the cops...
Goddamn it.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.950
Goddamn it.

09:20.985 --> 09:22.551
We were supposed to have
gotten away from this.

09:22.587 --> 09:23.652
What do you want from me?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.588
I want you to have not done it.

09:25.623 --> 09:26.389
You shouldn't have done it.

09:26.424 --> 09:27.790
Well, I did it!

09:27.825 --> 09:28.257
I did it, and it was me
in the swamp!

09:28.292 --> 09:29.692
Not you!

09:29.727 --> 09:30.760
It's my problem!
No, it's not!

09:30.795 --> 09:32.294
-Not yours!
-It's all our problems.

09:32.330 --> 09:33.696
It's mine!

09:33.731 --> 09:35.431
It's Ronald's.
It's his family's.

09:35.466 --> 09:37.066
It's all of ours.

09:44.534 --> 09:46.034
Take me to the police.

09:48.572 --> 09:49.604
If that's gonna fix this,

09:49.639 --> 09:51.606
if that'll make you feel safe,

09:51.641 --> 09:53.041
we can say goodbye to ArakNet.

09:56.646 --> 10:00.048
God! Fuck!
Son of a bitch!

10:17.834 --> 10:19.467
-Are we cool?
-Where am I taking you?

10:19.503 --> 10:21.069
I need your phone!

10:30.772 --> 10:32.705
-Izzy, where the fuck are you?
-No!

10:32.741 --> 10:34.707
No. I-I...
Meet me in Little Haiti.

10:34.743 --> 10:36.843
Pack up all our shit.
Everything.

10:36.878 --> 10:38.711
The dry-erase boards,
erase everything.

10:38.747 --> 10:40.646
Get everything,
put it in the car,

10:40.682 --> 10:41.614
and go!
What happened to you?

10:41.649 --> 10:43.983
You went totally off the grid!

10:44.019 --> 10:44.050
I was watching you,
and then the phone turned off.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.920
Rance! Are you not
listening to me?!

10:47.956 --> 10:50.056
Go! Okay, then. Drop
me a pin, Queen. Shit!

10:53.261 --> 10:54.060
Okay.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.231
Okay!

10:58.266 --> 10:59.065
Okay.

11:16.275 --> 11:17.041
Got you.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.073
Ronnie!

12:03.481 --> 12:04.046
We have a problem.

12:59.429 --> 13:01.896
It's R-Ronald.

13:01.931 --> 13:03.798
Ronald. I don't remember...

13:03.833 --> 13:05.833
Okay, but I don't know.
It's...

13:05.869 --> 13:08.603
Dacey! Dacey, Dacey!
It's Ronald Dacey!

13:08.638 --> 13:10.438
-Ronald Dacey?
-Exactly!

13:13.643 --> 13:14.400
Okay, what does that mean?

13:15.803 --> 13:18.237
Means?

13:18.272 --> 13:19.205
Rance?

13:19.240 --> 13:20.039
Izzy?

13:21.309 --> 13:22.441
Thank you!

13:22.477 --> 13:24.877
I couldn't find you!

13:24.912 --> 13:26.445
What's on your legs?
Is that... is that blood?

13:26.481 --> 13:27.380
Rance, get inside.

13:27.415 --> 13:28.047
-Okay.
-Go. Go.

13:29.192 --> 13:31.350
Go. Go. Go! Wait. Is that...
is that blood on your pants?

13:31.386 --> 13:32.752
Izzy?
Yes!

13:32.787 --> 13:34.954
-Izzy? Okay.
-Rance, yes, it's blood.

13:34.989 --> 13:38.332
Izzy, wha... -Okay? We're
in really deep shit.

13:38.368 --> 13:40.960
Nick, why does she have -Wblood on
her pants? d -I'm talking to you!

13:40.995 --> 13:42.170
Did you get everything?
Yes, I got everything!

13:42.205 --> 13:44.530
-Did you wipe the whiteboards?
-Yes, I wiped the whiteboards.

13:44.565 --> 13:45.073
I took down the papers.

13:45.108 --> 13:47.400
I took everything... Okay, okay, okay!
Did it work?

13:47.435 --> 13:49.635
Did what work?

13:49.670 --> 13:50.836
The cipher, the Trojan horse.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.571
Yeah! Duh! It's me.
Of course it worked.

13:52.607 --> 13:53.773
That's good, that's good.

13:53.808 --> 13:56.008
Okay, I need you...
I need you to go.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.634
I need you... Listen.
Tell me. Just-just... Queen.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.502
Queen, please.
No, no, no, no.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.571
-Just...
-Listen to me!

14:00.606 --> 14:03.807
I will call you. I promise.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.376
Just go back to Ybor City
and lay low.

14:05.411 --> 14:06.343
-Okay.
-Please.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.213
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:09.248 --> 14:10.047
Okay.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.052
Jesus Christ.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.059
Clean yourself up.

15:16.274 --> 15:17.073
Mom?

15:20.203 --> 15:21.035
Dad?

15:24.374 --> 15:26.374
Alex?

15:26.409 --> 15:28.609
Alex!

15:28.644 --> 15:30.277
-Honey!
-Surprise!

15:30.313 --> 15:32.380
Hey!

15:32.415 --> 15:33.047
What a surprise!

15:38.588 --> 15:40.054
Yeah, it's still the same.

15:41.324 --> 15:42.056
For sure.

15:44.827 --> 15:46.560
I still keep meaning
to update it.

15:46.596 --> 15:49.430
Make it a real guest room.

15:49.465 --> 15:51.632
No. It's perfect.

15:51.667 --> 15:53.067
This is a real nice surprise.

15:54.404 --> 15:56.504
Anyway...

15:56.539 --> 15:58.072
it's good to have you.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.071
Iz?

16:42.502 --> 16:43.034
Izzy, can you hear me?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.042
Agent Rask?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.045
You think he made it?

16:56.383 --> 16:58.049
I don't know.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.055
You messed up
real bad this time.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.060
Yeah.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.637
I just got off with Tam.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.071
Got her headed back with Els.

17:23.534 --> 17:25.367
I'm gonna send 'em away.

17:25.403 --> 17:27.036
Someplace safe.

17:30.608 --> 17:31.040
They gon' be coming at us...

17:33.244 --> 17:35.578
hard.

17:35.613 --> 17:36.746
All they want is me.

17:36.781 --> 17:38.547
-If I just leave...
-No, Izzy.

17:38.583 --> 17:41.650
They know we're your team.

17:41.686 --> 17:42.051
Meaning, if you come at them...

17:43.421 --> 17:46.655
we come at them.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.057
And now they're coming after us.

17:50.786 --> 17:51.060
And the cops ain't
gonna help neither.

17:53.965 --> 17:55.431
This shit gonna play out
on the street level.

17:55.466 --> 17:56.065
Not necessarily.

17:57.802 --> 17:58.601
-No, no, no.
-Just trust me.

17:58.636 --> 18:00.111
Two of their boys murdered.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.113
They ain't gonna sit on this
but for more than a second.

18:04.409 --> 18:05.908
Okay. I know.

18:05.943 --> 18:08.902
And of course, they're
very, very pissed off,

18:08.938 --> 18:09.770
and it makes a lot of sense,
they should be.

18:09.805 --> 18:11.505
But I think there's
a way to fix this

18:11.540 --> 18:13.474
where nobody gets hurt.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.509
They started Guizer...

18:15.544 --> 18:17.086
to help bolster GenCoin.

18:17.121 --> 18:19.780
'Cause the dark net is still
their biggest market, right?

18:19.815 --> 18:22.258
Well, if we take away
that demand...

18:22.293 --> 18:26.095
If we... if the three of us... if
ArakNet becomes that demand...

18:28.958 --> 18:30.057
-Then they need us.
-Yeah, then they need us.

18:32.561 --> 18:33.460
-It's too late.
-Why?

18:33.496 --> 18:35.829
Why is it too late?

18:35.865 --> 18:37.765
Because they're already
winning, Nick.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.766
But you do have
their cipher, right?

18:38.801 --> 18:41.035
That dumb plan worked?
Yes, I do.

18:41.037 --> 18:41.869
Okay, great. That'll buy us
a little time, right?

18:41.904 --> 18:44.004
Okay, right. It'll buy us
a little time.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.874
But we still need a team,
and we still need cash.

18:46.909 --> 18:48.342
Well, Wes Chandler's in.
So, by the way,

18:48.377 --> 18:51.770
while you were committing corporate
espionage and getting kidnapped,

18:51.805 --> 18:53.705
I closed that deal.
You're welcome.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.807
We just have to
make it to a place

18:55.843 --> 18:56.908
where they need us
more alive than dead.

18:56.944 --> 18:59.044
Right now we need to focus
on being not dead.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.046
Fine by me.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.049
I got some calls to make.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.400
Daddy, you ain't
coming with us?

19:21.435 --> 19:23.568
Nah, baby girl.

19:23.604 --> 19:24.469
Daddy got some work to do.

19:24.505 --> 19:26.605
What kind of work?

19:26.640 --> 19:28.373
Grown-folk work, baby girl.

19:28.409 --> 19:29.333
Okay.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.635
Don't worry.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.036
I'll come visit you real quick.

19:34.273 --> 19:35.406
Come on.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.274
Give Daddy a hug.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.510
All right.

19:39.545 --> 19:41.045
Get in there, baby girl.

19:45.585 --> 19:46.050
Just put your seatbelt on.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.054
I'm gonna clear
things up, all right?

19:54.260 --> 19:56.660
Yep.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.061
Tell your sister I said hello.

23:35.314 --> 23:38.073
That there earlier, that was my
family that I said goodbye to.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.036
Or what's left of 'em.

23:47.776 --> 23:50.844
Ain't nothing more
important to me...

23:50.879 --> 23:52.045
than those two girls
drove up out of here.

24:01.323 --> 24:02.055
Touissant.

24:04.292 --> 24:05.058
My boy.

24:07.462 --> 24:09.062
This ArakNet shit.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.065
It started with him.

24:13.301 --> 24:15.068
I know.

24:24.605 --> 24:26.038
So I'm gonna see it through.

24:29.577 --> 24:31.043
I'm gonna see it through.

24:35.783 --> 24:37.049
'Cause that's all
I have right here.

24:46.894 --> 24:49.061
But if you fuck up
like that again, Izzy...

24:55.636 --> 24:57.069
If you fuck up like that...

24:59.407 --> 25:01.073
ever again...

25:13.245 --> 25:14.044
Yeah?

25:17.316 --> 25:18.048
How many?

25:21.620 --> 25:23.754
All right. Let him through.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.589
Go stash yourself
in Elsie's closet.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.057
You and Nick both. Come on.

26:05.422 --> 26:07.055
You lost, bruh?

26:08.458 --> 26:10.058
Where's Isabelle?

26:13.463 --> 26:15.063
I ain't seen her.

26:17.634 --> 26:19.501
How 'bout you invite me in?

26:19.536 --> 26:21.436
Have a cup of coffee.

26:21.471 --> 26:22.070
We drink, we talk.

26:25.234 --> 26:26.033
Yeah.

26:29.405 --> 26:31.372
I'd rather not.

26:31.407 --> 26:33.040
Gavril. Misha.

26:34.543 --> 26:36.043
We forgive you for this.

26:37.646 --> 26:40.948
Long as you give us Isabelle.

26:40.983 --> 26:42.541
You know, I got no idea
what you talking 'bout.

26:42.576 --> 26:43.050
I'm just out here chilling.

26:44.854 --> 26:46.053
Just like all my friends.

27:07.468 --> 27:08.500
I come back then...

27:08.535 --> 27:10.635
with some of my friends.

27:10.671 --> 27:11.036
Please do.

27:13.374 --> 27:16.041
Please... do.

29:17.473 --> 29:18.805
So, this Wes dude...

29:18.841 --> 29:20.040
he gonna get us up and running?
Yeah.

29:22.478 --> 29:23.043
And you trust him?

29:27.716 --> 29:28.048
I don't know.
I trust his money.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.719
All right.

29:32.755 --> 29:34.654
We gotta tell him
about this, yo.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.822
About the gun collection? Why?

29:35.858 --> 29:38.725
Why is that?
About what we dealing with.

29:38.761 --> 29:40.460
We gotta be up front.
Come clean.

29:40.496 --> 29:41.528
I don't know, man.

29:41.563 --> 29:42.629
I'm telling you, bruh,

29:42.664 --> 29:43.730
we do not want
to start off

29:43.766 --> 29:45.665
on the wrong foot
with this dude.

29:45.701 --> 29:46.333
Exactly. That's exactly right.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.068
Lies, bruh.

29:49.772 --> 29:51.071
That's that shit
that'll poison us.

29:56.937 --> 29:58.670
I mean,
we can't do this without him.

29:58.705 --> 29:59.037
And hopefully
we don't have to.

30:01.975 --> 30:03.041
You really think we can keep
all this from him?

30:05.512 --> 30:08.880
Lies beget lies, bruh.

30:08.915 --> 30:10.048
That's how we sunk ourselves
with GenCoin.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.586
It's better to man up

30:14.621 --> 30:16.054
and get out in front of it.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.072
Babe, you coming to bed?

30:35.275 --> 30:36.032
Yeah.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.377
That a new one?

30:47.412 --> 30:49.545
What? The robe?

30:49.581 --> 30:51.514
No, I've had it.

30:51.549 --> 30:53.516
I like it.
Thank you.

30:53.551 --> 30:55.218
Your phone was ringing.

30:55.253 --> 30:56.052
Okay.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.227
Everything okay?

31:04.262 --> 31:05.061
Yeah.

31:07.265 --> 31:08.331
Yeah.

31:08.366 --> 31:09.065
Come here.

31:12.270 --> 31:13.069
Hey.

31:44.294 --> 31:46.528
Hello?

31:46.563 --> 31:48.397
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:48.432 --> 31:49.064
Hey.

31:52.503 --> 31:53.935
I saw you called me.

31:53.971 --> 31:55.070
Unless it was, like,
a butt dial or something.

31:57.474 --> 32:00.300
No, I... I called.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.268
Okay, so...

32:02.304 --> 32:03.036
what's up?

32:05.407 --> 32:08.041
Yeah. I...

32:11.546 --> 32:14.214
So I almost died today.

32:14.249 --> 32:16.483
What?

32:16.518 --> 32:17.550
It was really stupid.

32:17.586 --> 32:19.886
These Russian mobsters...

32:19.921 --> 32:22.989
thought that I put a virus
on their software,

32:23.025 --> 32:24.057
so they... Wait! Someone
tried to kill you?

32:26.261 --> 32:27.293
Yeah.

32:29.931 --> 32:31.564
Izzy, what the hell
are you doing out there?

32:31.600 --> 32:32.465
Like... like, are you hurt?

32:32.501 --> 32:33.833
Did... Are you okay?

32:33.869 --> 32:35.435
Like what...
No, I'm not. I'm not okay.

32:35.470 --> 32:37.070
But... I'm alive.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.033
Holy shit.

32:47.707 --> 32:49.507
I mean, all I
could think about

32:49.542 --> 32:50.308
at that moment was you,

32:50.343 --> 32:51.542
and... and...

32:51.578 --> 32:53.678
and wanting to say sorry.

32:53.713 --> 32:55.446
And... and wanting
to tell you

32:55.482 --> 32:57.048
how much I love you.

33:09.295 --> 33:10.061
Stella?

33:16.403 --> 33:18.569
-I...
-Stells?

33:18.605 --> 33:19.570
I have to go. I'm sorry.

33:19.606 --> 33:20.738
No, wait! Don't hang up!

33:20.774 --> 33:22.040
Don't hang up!
I'm sorry, I can't.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.074
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Listen to me.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.041
Shit.

33:37.716 --> 33:38.815
Babe.
Check this out.

33:38.851 --> 33:41.051
That craftsman came back
on the market.

33:42.421 --> 33:43.520
The...

33:43.555 --> 33:45.489
one on Waverly?
Yeah!

33:45.524 --> 33:46.056
Guess it fell through.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.493
Okay.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.029
Open house from 2-5.

33:52.031 --> 33:53.104
We should go over there
tomorrow and pounce, right?

33:56.268 --> 33:57.067
Yeah.

33:59.671 --> 34:01.071
Let me call this guy. Dennis.

34:03.942 --> 34:05.033
Yeah. Just shoot him
an email or something.

34:23.286 --> 34:25.053
Run it.

34:39.436 --> 34:41.069
Again.

35:02.450 --> 35:03.916
He's gonna bail.

35:03.952 --> 35:06.061
-He's not gonna bail.
-I would if I were him.

35:06.096 --> 35:09.489
"Hi, Wes. We're so excited
to be working with you.

35:09.524 --> 35:12.025
"Those guys.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.134
"Those are just Russian
mobsters who will be making

35:13.170 --> 35:16.629
"frequent attempts on my life
while they run this company.

35:16.664 --> 35:18.831
No big. Where shall we sign?"

35:18.867 --> 35:20.933
Well, let's just
not say it like that.

35:20.969 --> 35:22.068
Just let me talk it out
with him, all right?

35:29.435 --> 35:30.034
He's gonna bail.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.049
-Hey.
-Hey, sorry, I'm late, man.

35:46.919 --> 35:48.619
No problem. Wes,
this is Ronald Dacey.

35:48.654 --> 35:50.755
Ronald! What a pleasure, man.

35:50.790 --> 35:53.190
-Izzy Morales.
-Izzy. Fantastic!

35:54.927 --> 35:57.103
So good to finally
meet the rest of the team.

35:57.138 --> 35:59.530
Yeah! Yeah, this is
the heart and soul of ArakNet.

35:59.565 --> 36:01.065
Hey, look, bruh...

36:02.702 --> 36:05.603
I'm just gonna cut the bullshit.

36:05.638 --> 36:07.146
Just gonna get right to it.

36:07.182 --> 36:10.567
All right? You know, it's nice
to meet you face-to-face.

36:10.602 --> 36:13.370
Hopefully, we BFF some day.

36:13.405 --> 36:14.037
But right now...

36:15.081 --> 36:17.081
we got a small issue that
we need to wind out for you.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.912
Okay. -We need to be
straight with you.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.048
About any baggage
that we bring to the table.

36:27.019 --> 36:28.785
Baggage? -Yeah. Just a
little bit of baggage.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.820
No, we've got more
than a little bit.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.822
It's more than
a little bit of baggage.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.824
Again, it's just me
being real with you.

36:34.860 --> 36:35.058
'Cause honesty's
what this shit's about.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.065
All right.

36:44.636 --> 36:45.068
So, we got some competition.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.972
Guizer. I ain't worried.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.974
No, I ain't worried
'bout their business.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.176
-We'll smoke them.
-We got some personal issues.

36:53.211 --> 36:57.080
Recently, things came to a head
with some of their backers.

36:59.709 --> 37:00.041
The Kazankov family.

37:03.013 --> 37:05.546
They tried to ghost
your girl Isabelle right here.

37:05.582 --> 37:06.414
Tried to ghost her?

37:06.449 --> 37:08.783
Merk. Eight-six.

37:08.818 --> 37:10.051
Put a girl in the dirt.
Ya feel me?

37:15.392 --> 37:17.058
That's...

37:19.562 --> 37:21.337
That's exciting.
No.

37:21.373 --> 37:24.932
-I would... I would say the reason...
-And they're still at it, bruh.

37:24.968 --> 37:26.067
And they gonna be
at this shit for some time.

37:27.570 --> 37:29.404
They ain't gonna stop...

37:29.439 --> 37:31.506
until she dead.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.032
Or until we beat them.

37:37.939 --> 37:39.038
So that's just us
putting that shit out there.

37:40.475 --> 37:41.040
Cards on the table.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.047
Excuse me.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.328
Well... we're done.

37:54.364 --> 37:56.956
-Let's just... let's just give him a minute.
-He's done. We're done.

37:56.991 --> 37:58.758
-That's not true. We don't know that.
-Okay.

37:58.793 --> 38:00.068
-He's still...
-He's not coming back.

38:00.103 --> 38:02.470
He's kinda still here though.
Hey. Right. I mean...

38:02.505 --> 38:05.106
-So let's chill out. Let's give him...
I don't know what he's talking about.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.301
Just... you guys don't know him.

38:09.337 --> 38:10.436
I think...

38:10.471 --> 38:11.070
I think he might.

38:13.274 --> 38:14.306
Okay.

38:14.342 --> 38:16.401
Drink up.

38:16.436 --> 38:17.035
Goin' for a ride.

38:19.239 --> 38:20.572
Babe!

38:20.607 --> 38:22.040
I went by the Waverly place.

38:24.945 --> 38:27.045
I just think that place
really has something.

38:31.251 --> 38:32.050
Babe?

39:17.589 --> 39:18.054
Maybe he's gonna kill us.

40:03.326 --> 40:04.058
Welcome.

40:05.328 --> 40:07.428
To what?

40:07.463 --> 40:08.062
Your new office.

40:20.176 --> 40:22.076
I was getting ready to turn
this whole thing into a resort.

40:24.438 --> 40:25.037
Then '08 happened.

40:26.374 --> 40:28.540
I don't know.

40:28.576 --> 40:29.041
I mean, it's salvageable.

40:30.778 --> 40:33.379
We'll spruce it up
as we go along.

40:33.414 --> 40:35.047
Main thing is...

40:36.684 --> 40:37.049
nobody'll ever look for us here.

40:39.887 --> 40:42.721
Yeah. Nobody will ever
wanna work here.

40:42.757 --> 40:43.055
How am I supposed
to hire a team?

40:44.367 --> 40:46.759
You just pay everybody a little
bit more than anybody else would.

40:46.794 --> 40:48.961
What... what about
infrastructure?

40:48.996 --> 40:51.363
Why don't you let me
and Mara worry about that?

40:51.399 --> 40:53.999
And...

40:54.035 --> 40:55.901
you're all gonna be living
on the island with me.

40:55.936 --> 40:57.069
Till this whole Kazankov
thing blows over.

40:58.506 --> 40:59.338
Speaking of which...

40:59.373 --> 41:01.440
Hey, Ronald?

41:01.475 --> 41:03.034
May I get a word?

41:25.232 --> 41:27.658
I appreciate you being straight
with me back there, my man,

41:27.694 --> 41:30.061
so... I'll be straight with you.

41:31.865 --> 41:34.065
What do you see
as your role at ArakNet?

41:39.506 --> 41:40.972
Founded that shit.

41:41.007 --> 41:42.314
Got the user base up.
No, no, yeah. Of course.

41:42.349 --> 41:45.901
Of course, but, like, look. I
got an investment in there now.

41:45.937 --> 41:47.737
It's about to get big.
It's about to get real.

41:47.772 --> 41:49.772
That's the plan.
Ain't that right?

41:49.807 --> 41:51.040
So how do you see
yourself fitting in?

41:57.515 --> 41:58.047
What you gettin' at?

42:00.451 --> 42:02.618
I need to know...

42:02.653 --> 42:04.453
can you protect my investment?

42:04.489 --> 42:05.054
Talking about Izzy.

42:15.666 --> 42:16.766
You want me to be your nigga.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.509
Come on, man.
I didn't say that.

42:18.545 --> 42:22.638
-Hey, but that's where you goin' though, right?
-Look, look. I did my research.

42:22.673 --> 42:23.114
I know what you're capable of.

42:23.149 --> 42:25.074
I know who you're connected to...
That ain't me, bruh!

42:27.770 --> 42:29.036
I ain't tryin' to do
all that, man.

42:30.373 --> 42:32.039
Come on, Wes.

42:34.777 --> 42:36.643
You can buy
your own security, man.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.579
Nick and Izzy, they trust you.

42:38.614 --> 42:40.414
You're all in this together.

42:40.449 --> 42:42.950
And by the way...

42:42.985 --> 42:44.351
anybody who makes his living
protecting people,

42:44.387 --> 42:46.162
I don't trust.

42:46.197 --> 42:48.097
'Cause there's always somebody
coming around with more money.

42:51.627 --> 42:53.427
Now, my dough's in the bank.

42:53.462 --> 42:55.062
It's ready to go.

42:58.601 --> 42:59.066
How bad you want ArakNet?

43:04.607 --> 43:06.032
Just give it some thought.

43:07.305 --> 43:13.744
