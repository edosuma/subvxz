WEBVTT

00:01.510 --> 00:03.777
So here we go.
What letter are we up to now?

00:03.812 --> 00:04.778
J's. My crown is my crown.

00:04.814 --> 00:07.814
So, jeremiah if it's a boy,

00:07.850 --> 00:09.550
Or jacinta if it's a girl.

00:09.585 --> 00:12.553
Jeremiah sexton-jenkins.

00:12.588 --> 00:14.922
I like it. My god, it's a boy?

00:14.957 --> 00:18.392
Or jacinta sexton-jenkins.

00:18.427 --> 00:20.060
You're having fun torturing me.

00:20.096 --> 00:22.141
By not telling me the gender
of the baby, aren't you?

00:22.165 --> 00:23.030
A little, but hey,

00:23.065 --> 00:26.433
If I can wait 21 more weeks,
so can you.

00:28.838 --> 00:31.005
Dr. Rhodes?

00:31.040 --> 00:32.640
Page me if you need me.

00:32.674 --> 00:33.807
Case coming your way.

00:33.843 --> 00:35.743
Window washer fell 33 stories.

00:35.778 --> 00:38.412
Should be doa,
but still alive... Barely.

00:38.447 --> 00:40.814
33? Press will be all over this.

00:40.850 --> 00:42.816
Hospital pr's gonna be involved.

00:42.852 --> 00:45.486
Get ready for your close-up.

00:48.491 --> 00:50.090
Okay, who's next?

00:50.126 --> 00:51.525
Damian butler.

00:51.561 --> 00:54.862
Damian butler? That's me.

00:54.897 --> 00:55.996
God.

00:56.032 --> 00:57.665
Won't be much longer.

00:57.700 --> 00:58.933
It's just I have the flu.

00:58.968 --> 01:01.569
It's low priority. I get it.

01:02.738 --> 01:03.704
Sir?

01:03.739 --> 01:05.873
Maggie, how many minutes out?
They're here.

01:05.908 --> 01:08.209
Baghdad's prepped. Thanks.

01:11.013 --> 01:14.481
Justin pepper, 23,
long fall, axial load injury.

01:14.517 --> 01:16.450
After his window washing
platform gave out.

01:16.485 --> 01:19.787
Gcs, 3... bp, 70 over palp...
Heart rate, 135.

01:19.822 --> 01:20.899
All right, that long a fall,
we're looking at.

01:20.923 --> 01:23.691
Injuries to the brain, spine,
chest, and abdomen,

01:23.726 --> 01:25.226
Let alone long bone fractures.

01:25.261 --> 01:27.661
Maggie, I need extra hands
and an o.R. On alert.

01:27.697 --> 01:28.796
Done.

01:28.831 --> 01:31.532
What's he got for iv access?
16 gauge on both arms.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.033
All right,
very gently, everybody.

01:33.069 --> 01:36.870
On my count, one, two, three.

01:38.007 --> 01:40.074
Good luck. Thanks.

01:40.109 --> 01:41.809
All right,
likely cavitary bleeding.

01:41.844 --> 01:44.511
Wheeler, get a groin line.
Start the mtp.

01:44.547 --> 01:47.047
Hang two units of o-neg
on the rapid transfuser.

01:47.083 --> 01:48.983
Until we type and cross.
X-rays...

01:49.018 --> 01:51.218
I need chest, pelvis,
and c-spine.

01:51.254 --> 01:52.731
And let's get
the ultrasound over here.

01:52.755 --> 01:53.821
To fast his belly.

01:53.856 --> 01:54.622
Lungs are clear. All right.

01:54.657 --> 01:55.867
I'm gonna start the groin line.

01:55.891 --> 01:57.258
Help me reduce
this leg fracture.

01:57.293 --> 02:00.194
Come on, come on.
One, two, three...

02:01.731 --> 02:03.697
X-ray. All right, step back.

02:09.572 --> 02:11.171
Pelvis down.

02:11.207 --> 02:13.007
C-spine. On the box.

02:15.711 --> 02:17.945
Chest x-ray is up.
Tension hemopneumothorax.

02:17.980 --> 02:20.047
Trachea shifted,
venous return is down.

02:20.082 --> 02:21.248
Give me a chest tube.

02:21.284 --> 02:22.516
Show me the pelvis.

02:22.551 --> 02:23.484
Got it.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.686
Vertical shear of
the left hemipelvis...

02:25.721 --> 02:27.187
It needs traction.

02:27.223 --> 02:28.856
Pull up the c-spine.

02:28.891 --> 02:29.923
Up.

02:29.959 --> 02:33.794
Multiple c-spine fractures.

02:33.829 --> 02:36.230
Wheeler, how's that groin line?
Done.

02:36.265 --> 02:37.698
All right, chest tube's in too.

02:37.733 --> 02:38.599
Let's move.

02:38.634 --> 02:41.035
Justin didn't survive
a 330-foot fall.

02:41.070 --> 02:42.703
Just to die in my trauma bay.

02:42.738 --> 02:44.104
Let's go, let's go! Go.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.340 --> 02:55.541
Witnesses report
that mr. Pepper clung to.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.543
The window washing platform
as it fell,

02:57.578 --> 02:59.879
Almost riding it
like a surfboard.

02:59.914 --> 03:03.182
Physicists surmise this likely
created wind resistance.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.017
That not only slowed
his plummet,

03:05.052 --> 03:07.887
But also absorbed
some of the force from impact.

03:07.922 --> 03:10.089
<i>That might explain
how he survived.</i>

03:10.124 --> 03:11.924
<i>Such a horrific fall.</i>

03:11.959 --> 03:14.093
I'm running the bowel.

03:14.128 --> 03:15.828
Feeling tears.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.565
Hemostat.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.834
Pelvic hematoma and mesenteric
bleeders are tied off.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.069
Let's resect the bowel quickly
and move on.

03:24.105 --> 03:26.939
Gia 80 stapler with a reload.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.842
50% of people who fall
four to five stories die.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.677
Ten or 11... it's almost 100%,

03:31.712 --> 03:34.413
So this is a first.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.415
There's an exception
to every rule.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.919
All right,
got some more spaces... next.

03:39.954 --> 03:41.687
Laura pastino.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.422
Laura pastino?

03:43.457 --> 03:46.692
No, melody sayers.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.061
Okay, treatment 3.
I'll be right there.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.697
I'm sorry. No, this one's on me.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.143
I thought I could sneak in
and see a doctor.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.700
On my lunch break.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.769
It's bad planning.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.572
Okay, I'm april.
Can I get you anything?

03:59.607 --> 04:01.106
Water? Snack from the meal cart?

04:01.142 --> 04:05.044
No thanks.
Not much of an appetite.

04:05.079 --> 04:07.780
If I need something,
I'll just...

04:09.984 --> 04:11.951
Melody?

04:11.986 --> 04:13.953
Are you okay?

04:13.988 --> 04:16.555
Yeah, sorry.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.958
You just zoned out.
That ever happen before?

04:18.993 --> 04:20.559
Probably.

04:20.595 --> 04:24.096
I'm a first-year associate.
My law firm's specialty.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.632
60-hour weeks.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.967
Can I see your wrist?

04:28.002 --> 04:29.201
Yeah.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.672
Pulse is really weak.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.241
I'm just exhausted.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.077
I'm gonna go home and sleep.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.646
I'll come back tomorrow.

04:40.681 --> 04:41.981
Your feet hurt?

04:42.016 --> 04:44.583
Yeah, I've just been sitting
for awhile.

04:44.619 --> 04:46.986
Do you mind if I take a look?

04:47.021 --> 04:48.554
Sure.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.626
Ankles are swollen.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.962
Pitting edema.

04:56.998 --> 04:57.998
Do me a favor.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.531
Stick around
for a little longer.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.200
I'm gonna get you in.

05:01.235 --> 05:02.768
Okay.

05:07.008 --> 05:09.208
Americano. Thank you.

05:09.243 --> 05:11.777
Wow, all this for
connor's trauma?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.713
If it bleeds, it leads.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.615
Help! I need help!

05:16.651 --> 05:18.317
My husband!

05:20.688 --> 05:22.032
What happened?
He called me at work.

05:22.056 --> 05:23.989
He said he wasn't feeling well.
But then...

05:24.025 --> 05:26.325
But when I came home for lunch,
I-i found him like this.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.127
Hey, hey, can you hear me?

05:28.162 --> 05:30.029
Thready pulse, diaphoretic.
He's burning up.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.208
He take any drugs?
Could it be an overdose?

05:31.232 --> 05:32.564
No, never.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.399
Septic shock?

05:33.434 --> 05:34.544
I think so.
We gotta get him inside.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.534
All right, I'm gonna get techs
to bring out a gurney,

05:35.569 --> 05:38.037
And set up for central access
if we need one.

05:38.072 --> 05:40.005
I'm gonna help you
out of the car, okay?

05:40.041 --> 05:41.151
No, get back.
I can do it myself.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.809
No, nick, let him help you.
Don't let him, please.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.078
Easy. Nick, please, no...

05:46.113 --> 05:47.713
Julia... julia...

05:47.748 --> 05:50.049
I need your help.
I know, baby, I-i...

05:50.084 --> 05:51.583
I'm sorry.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.988
Okay, okay.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.756
My legs don't work.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.892
It's okay, nick. I got you.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.593
Here.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.066
All right.

06:07.101 --> 06:08.867
Let's go.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.711
Dr. Choi, you're going to
treatment 5.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.246
Dr. Manning's already there.
Thanks, mags.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.754
Dr. Reese?

06:30.257 --> 06:33.092
My... This woman needs aid.

06:33.127 --> 06:33.892
Dr. Wheeler!

06:33.928 --> 06:34.827
I saw her fall
crossing the street.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.730
When I got to her,
she was unable to speak.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.065
Think she's having a stroke.
Treatment 2.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.709
Weak pulse... right side of
the face is droopy.

06:50.745 --> 06:52.122
Right side body, limp.
What do we got?

06:52.146 --> 06:54.279
Possible stroke.

06:54.315 --> 06:56.915
Okay. Thanks, super-dude.

06:56.951 --> 06:58.884
You're safe now, ma'am.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.325
Lord.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.394
We need a stretcher!

07:14.435 --> 07:16.402
Right now, your son is in shock.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.737
There is massive blood loss
from extensive injuries.

07:18.773 --> 07:21.140
To his liver, his pelvis,
his intestines.

07:21.175 --> 07:23.742
We've packed his abdomen
to control the bleeding.

07:23.778 --> 07:25.778
And removed a portion
of his bowel.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.312
He's still open.

07:27.348 --> 07:30.149
That's what we call
a negative pressure dressing.

07:30.184 --> 07:32.151
It helps to temporize
the abdomen...

07:32.186 --> 07:34.987
Is justin going to survive?

07:35.022 --> 07:37.990
When he arrived in the e.D.,
he was minute to minute.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.992
Right now, he is hour to hour,

07:40.027 --> 07:42.394
And that is
a very good first step.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.269
This is dr. Rhodes.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.272
Who is this
and how did you get this number?

07:53.307 --> 07:56.375
No, my patient is
very much alive, thank you.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.311
Sounds like the press
got to you before we did.

07:59.346 --> 08:02.114
Dr. Connor rhodes,
this is evelyn kumer,

08:02.149 --> 08:04.016
Public affairs rep
for the hospital.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.785
She'll be coordinating
all media platforms.

08:06.821 --> 08:08.153
So, reporters got your number?

08:08.189 --> 08:10.322
Yeah, they wanted to know
if justin had died.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.323
On the operating table.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.291
Where do they get this crap?

08:12.326 --> 08:15.027
Who knows?
But the rumor mill is grinding.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.695
And you're in the spotlight.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.331
A man falls 33 stories
and is still alive?

08:19.366 --> 08:20.732
People are gonna want to know,

08:20.768 --> 08:23.035
Is this a miracle
or a setup for tragedy?

08:23.070 --> 08:24.136
Excuse me.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.372
Until we know for sure
how this is gonna turn out,

08:27.408 --> 08:30.476
Let's stick with "no comment."

08:35.916 --> 08:38.383
102.7. Bp, 80 over 55.

08:38.419 --> 08:40.352
Whoa, that's really low.

08:40.386 --> 08:43.222
Melody, I hear
a crackling in your chest.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.158
This means fluid is building up
in the lungs.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.160
A symptom of the flu?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.028
I don't think so.
The exhaustion,

08:50.064 --> 08:52.064
Swelling in your legs,
low blood pressure.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.867
Are possible indicators of
a cardiac problem.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.169
My heart? My god.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.905
We're gonna take a look
and see what's going on, okay?

08:59.940 --> 09:01.373
Okay.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.442
That just...
That doesn't make any sense.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.878
I'm only 25 years old.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.213
I walk to work
instead of taking the train.

09:08.249 --> 09:11.416
Eat salads... Take spin classes.

09:11.452 --> 09:13.519
Okay, dilated left ventricle,
poor wall motion.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.121
April,
let's get her on the monitor.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.790
Your heart is pumping
very poorly.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.392
I'll need an echo,
but if I had to say,

09:20.427 --> 09:23.028
I'd guess it's working at
20, 25%.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.530
My heart is failing?

09:24.565 --> 09:26.198
It's unusual for a young woman.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.268
Could be a thyroid imbalance,
a kidney issue, virus.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.780
We'll figure it out.
Before you know it,

09:30.804 --> 09:32.905
You'll be back at spin class.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.007
I'm gonna hold you to that.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.777
Melody... Melody?

09:40.981 --> 09:43.582
No pulse or breathing.
V fib... get on her chest.

09:45.119 --> 09:46.451
Charge to 200.

09:46.487 --> 09:47.819
200.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.223
Charged.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.292
Hold cpr.

09:53.327 --> 09:54.526
Clear.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.431
200 again.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.832
200.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.902
Hold cpr.

10:03.938 --> 10:06.138
Clear.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.005
I got a pulse.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.941
It's weak but steady.
She's breathing.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.943
Let's get her to the cath lab.

10:17.351 --> 10:19.484
Great catch, april.
Had she gone home,

10:19.520 --> 10:22.487
No way help would've
gotten to her in time.

10:29.554 --> 10:31.299
So it's an infection?
Fever, elevated white cells,

10:31.323 --> 10:32.055
Inflammatory markers,
wand lacate.?

10:32.091 --> 10:34.992
I'd say so. Most likely uti.

10:35.027 --> 10:36.293
It's common in paraplegics.

10:36.328 --> 10:37.895
Been down that road a few times.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.329
Life with a catheter, right?

10:39.365 --> 10:43.200
We made to need to replace it.
Suprapubic?

10:43.235 --> 10:46.370
T-boned by a drunk driver
who didn't stop for a red light.

10:46.405 --> 10:47.905
He walked away
with a few stitches.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.573
That was then. We're moving on.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.209
Brighter days ahead.

10:52.244 --> 10:54.177
Area around the catheter
looks clean.

10:54.213 --> 10:55.913
No obvious abscess
or skin infection.

10:55.948 --> 10:57.347
Answer's in the pee then.

10:57.383 --> 10:59.416
We'll get this and blood
cultures up to the lab,

10:59.451 --> 11:01.485
Find out
what we're dealing with.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.420
Sorry about lashing out earlier.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.055
I sometimes forget
I'm half a man.

11:05.090 --> 11:07.391
No, you're not.

11:07.426 --> 11:08.225
I'm with her.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.227
Yeah, well, she's one of a kind.

11:10.262 --> 11:12.529
Not letting her get away.

11:12.565 --> 11:14.231
Good plan.

11:19.371 --> 11:21.572
Hey... K...

11:21.607 --> 11:23.574
If it's a boy, kalani.

11:23.609 --> 11:25.576
If it's a girl, kiersleigh.

11:25.611 --> 11:26.577
What do you think?

11:26.612 --> 11:28.245
Pass. Ulch.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.280
Any word from the cath lab
about melody?

11:30.316 --> 11:31.949
No, but I should hear
something soon.

11:31.984 --> 11:34.518
Okay, I have an ob appointment.

11:34.553 --> 11:36.353
Should be fast, though...
20 minutes, tops.

11:36.388 --> 11:37.254
I can push it.

11:37.289 --> 11:38.500
Or I can text you
if I hear something.

11:38.524 --> 11:42.259
Because of the tb, dr. Lee
likes to see me every two weeks.

11:42.294 --> 11:44.127
You'll text me about melody?

11:44.163 --> 11:46.096
Now go, don't be late for
your appointment.

11:52.338 --> 11:54.137
We haven't officially met.
I'm dr. Reese.

11:54.173 --> 11:56.440
Hi. Edward thompson.

11:56.475 --> 11:57.975
That was quite an entrance,
edward.

11:58.010 --> 12:00.210
Yeah, I could imagine.

12:00.245 --> 12:02.079
The suit,
elderly woman in my arms.

12:02.114 --> 12:03.580
Yeah. How is she?

12:03.616 --> 12:04.982
Doing well...

12:05.017 --> 12:06.294
Thanks to you
getting her here so quickly.

12:06.318 --> 12:07.618
That's great.

12:07.653 --> 12:09.152
How are you?
How are you feeling?

12:09.188 --> 12:11.088
Okay, I think.

12:11.123 --> 12:13.590
But I never passed out before.
What... what happened?

12:13.626 --> 12:16.326
Your labs and ekg are normal,

12:16.362 --> 12:19.062
So I think you were just
so excited in the moment.

12:19.098 --> 12:20.497
That when it was over,
you fainted.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.132
And where are my clothes?

12:22.167 --> 12:25.102
A nurse said she'd get 'em,
but she never came back.

12:25.137 --> 12:27.104
Unfortunately,
we had to cut off the costume,

12:27.139 --> 12:28.472
So that we could examine you.

12:28.507 --> 12:30.374
Cut it off?

12:31.710 --> 12:34.344
You mean... It's destroyed?

12:34.380 --> 12:36.246
Yes.

12:36.281 --> 12:39.082
God.

12:39.118 --> 12:41.485
You had no right. I...

12:41.520 --> 12:43.587
I need it.

12:43.622 --> 12:45.155
Edward, breathe.

12:45.190 --> 12:46.356
Breathe.

12:46.392 --> 12:47.357
All right, nice and s-
all right, here.

12:47.393 --> 12:51.361
Hey, look at me, look at me.

12:51.397 --> 12:53.664
Just like this. Two seconds in.

12:53.699 --> 12:55.799
Four seconds out.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.634
Two seconds in.

12:57.670 --> 12:59.636
Four seconds out.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.206
I need it.

13:16.555 --> 13:19.322
33 stories. God.

13:19.358 --> 13:21.158
Massive subdural hemorrhage.

13:21.193 --> 13:22.325
Significant left shift.

13:22.361 --> 13:26.463
Big mass effect is crushing
his brain inside of his skull.

13:26.498 --> 13:28.365
Well, he did fall off
a building.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.800
Craniotomy, right?

13:29.835 --> 13:32.069
To what end? He's coagulopathic.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.215
I go in and take out the clot,
it'll just re-accumulate.

13:34.239 --> 13:35.272
No, I don't think so.

13:35.307 --> 13:38.175
I'm actively giving him
plasma, platelets, and cryo.

13:38.210 --> 13:39.821
Which improve
his overall chances of survival.

13:39.845 --> 13:42.345
From 1% to 2.
I'm not opening up his skull.

13:42.381 --> 13:44.392
I question whether he's even
strong enough for this ct,

13:44.416 --> 13:46.383
But that was your call.

13:46.418 --> 13:48.552
If the pressure
in his brain isn't relieved,

13:48.587 --> 13:51.755
It's over. That's 100%.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.558
I got him this far.
He'll get through surgery.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.363
All the king's horses
and all the king's men...

14:00.399 --> 14:02.599
Guess they should've
gone to you.

14:05.437 --> 14:08.071
Full costume? Cape and all.

14:08.107 --> 14:09.617
When edward learned
it had been destroyed,

14:09.641 --> 14:12.676
He was so distraught,
he could hardly even breathe.

14:12.711 --> 14:14.745
That's a pretty
extreme reaction,

14:14.780 --> 14:18.215
But, you know,
wardrobe and self-esteem.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.716
Can be deeply intertwined.

14:19.752 --> 14:22.352
The costume...
Ultimately, it's just a symbol.

14:22.387 --> 14:25.889
That represent something
crucially important to edward.

14:25.924 --> 14:27.858
Our job's to figure out what.

14:27.893 --> 14:31.261
The inciting incident
that made it necessary...

14:31.296 --> 14:34.097
The origin story.

14:34.133 --> 14:35.777
You know, because
we're talking about a superhero.

14:35.801 --> 14:37.134
Like...

14:37.169 --> 14:39.636
Like when tony stark
became iron man.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.705
Why did billy batson
become captain marvel?

14:41.740 --> 14:43.740
Nice. Pickle.

14:45.577 --> 14:46.743
Urinalysis is clean,

14:46.779 --> 14:48.879
So your infection
isn't from a uti.

14:48.914 --> 14:50.180
Clear.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.455
Not pneumonia.

14:58.490 --> 15:01.725
Meds?
Aspirin, midodrine, tramadol.

15:01.760 --> 15:05.395
No steroids, immunosuppressants.
No red flags.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.297
I'll check the d-dimer.
It could be a dvt.

15:07.332 --> 15:10.167
Yeah. Deep vein thrombosis?

15:10.202 --> 15:12.169
D-dimer's negative. No clots.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.403
Abscess then.

15:13.438 --> 15:15.472
The hot spot
would be the sacrum.

15:16.975 --> 15:19.376
I-I can't... yeah, I got you.

15:26.952 --> 15:29.286
Nothing dermal.

15:29.321 --> 15:31.822
It must be hiding deep down.

15:31.857 --> 15:34.825
The, scar...

15:34.860 --> 15:37.794
I'm thinking of getting
a tattoo to cover it...

15:37.830 --> 15:40.330
He and she stick figures
riding pops.

15:40.365 --> 15:42.699
It's a surf spot in waikiki.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.835
We took a lesson
on our honeymoon.

15:44.870 --> 15:47.504
We stood up on our first wave.

15:53.812 --> 15:56.279
Did you feel something?

15:58.851 --> 16:00.851
Um, I don't know.

16:00.886 --> 16:02.853
Maybe.

16:05.224 --> 16:07.524
Let's get a ct chest,
pelvis and abdomen.

16:07.559 --> 16:10.727
Infection may be abdominal
or in a deep space.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.530
Yeah. Hang tight.

16:13.565 --> 16:16.600
We're getting closer.
We'll be back.

16:17.703 --> 16:20.604
You felt that?

16:25.277 --> 16:27.377
Good hemostasis. No new bleeds.

16:27.412 --> 16:29.713
He tolerated the surgery well.

16:29.748 --> 16:33.583
Appears luck's
on your side today.

16:33.619 --> 16:35.452
If that's how you wanna put it.

16:42.594 --> 16:43.560
There's no heartbeat.

16:43.595 --> 16:44.561
No.

16:44.596 --> 16:47.230
No, no, please, look again.

16:47.266 --> 16:48.498
I'm so sorry.

16:48.533 --> 16:49.966
No.

16:53.805 --> 16:56.573
Wh... You'll need a d&c.

16:56.608 --> 16:59.676
If there's a room available,
I can do it now.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.798
Okay.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.567
I need to get back to work.

17:24.603 --> 17:26.403
April,
no one would expect you to...

17:26.438 --> 17:28.605
I have to. I...

17:28.640 --> 17:32.943
There's a... a patient
I'm worried about.

17:32.978 --> 17:34.945
Are you sure?

17:37.816 --> 17:40.784
Okay.

17:40.819 --> 17:42.652
Well, you know the nurses
up there.

17:42.688 --> 17:45.055
You just give them a call
when you're ready.

17:45.090 --> 17:47.490
The sooner the better.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.929
End of the day.

17:52.965 --> 17:55.799
Tomorrow at the latest.

18:30.736 --> 18:32.669
Hey, april.

18:32.704 --> 18:35.005
Cardiology make a diagnosis?

18:35.040 --> 18:37.540
Viral myocarditis.

18:37.576 --> 18:40.677
She's only in the e.D.
Until a bed opens up in the cc...

18:40.712 --> 18:42.846
She needs
cardiopulmonary support.

18:42.881 --> 18:44.714
Infection's that bad?

18:44.750 --> 18:46.483
Well, the hope is partial bypass.

18:46.518 --> 18:47.450
Will rest her heart enough.

18:47.486 --> 18:50.720
To let the antiviral meds
get the upper hand.

18:58.730 --> 19:01.865
That's doing most of
my heart's job now.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.133
I know.

19:03.168 --> 19:08.371
It's hard to keep your mind
from racing to that dark place.

19:08.407 --> 19:11.975
Is there anyone I can call?
Family?

19:12.010 --> 19:13.810
My parents are divorced.

19:13.845 --> 19:16.579
Mom's in idaho.
Dad's in new hampshire.

19:16.615 --> 19:19.516
I'm not ready to deal with
all that yet.

19:19.551 --> 19:23.520
But I don't want to be alone.

19:23.555 --> 19:26.056
Will you sit with me?

19:34.132 --> 19:37.867
As long as you need.

19:37.903 --> 19:40.003
Thank you.

19:51.823 --> 19:52.823
What was her name?

19:52.860 --> 19:55.994
Rachel. Ring her to you.
Way out of my league.L.

19:57.631 --> 19:58.842
I've always been the quite one.

19:58.866 --> 20:01.999
She was the opposite.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.104
I rode her coattails,

20:06.140 --> 20:07.872
Yet she still loved me.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.211
And then it was over.
My wife was gone.

20:13.247 --> 20:14.713
When did rachel pass?

20:14.747 --> 20:17.883
Last year... ovarian cancer.

20:17.918 --> 20:21.687
It took her so fast.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.722
I couldn't help her.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.224
I couldn't ease her pain.

20:26.260 --> 20:30.028
I could only watch.

20:30.064 --> 20:33.698
I was useless, weak.

20:33.734 --> 20:36.068
And the suit?
Stumbled across it online.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.904
I don't know why I ordered it.

20:38.939 --> 20:42.006
But when it came, I tried it on,
and...

20:45.012 --> 20:48.113
I felt different, stronger.

20:48.148 --> 20:51.216
I just want to be useful.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.785
I just wanna be able to help.

20:53.821 --> 20:56.321
I understand...

20:56.357 --> 20:59.091
We'll come up with a plan.

20:59.126 --> 21:02.093
Let me talk to my supervisor.

21:05.799 --> 21:08.566
Hey, how was your ultrasound?

21:08.602 --> 21:09.901
It was fine.

21:09.937 --> 21:12.004
I was just thinking
about melody.

21:12.039 --> 21:14.139
She thought
she only had the flu.

21:14.174 --> 21:16.742
Yeah. Okay.

21:19.780 --> 21:22.647
Hey, walk with me.
The cps working?

21:22.683 --> 21:24.616
A-line pulsatility
is decreasing.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.618
Heart's beating less and less
on its own.

21:26.653 --> 21:27.586
But it's only been a few hours.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.088
The meds need awhile
to build in her system.

21:30.124 --> 21:33.191
And we can't speed up
the process?

21:33.227 --> 21:35.627
We can?

21:35.662 --> 21:38.095
Ivig and plasmapheresis.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.930
It's method to block
melody's immune system.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.099
From attacking heart muscle.

21:41.135 --> 21:42.312
As it tries to clear
the infection.

21:42.336 --> 21:45.870
Well, why aren't we doing it?
The science is unproven.

21:45.906 --> 21:47.205
The unknowns worry me.

21:47.241 --> 21:49.841
The risk of anaphylaxis,
additional infections,

21:49.877 --> 21:52.778
Inflammatory side effects.
Well, she already coded.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.391
Another one could be
right around the corner.

21:54.415 --> 21:56.048
Isn't it worth trying anything?

21:56.082 --> 21:57.783
Not if it does
more harm than good.

21:58.919 --> 22:00.285
Yes, and the suit.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.787
Was how edward dealt
with his wife's death.

22:02.823 --> 22:04.790
See, I'm concerned
that if he leaves,

22:04.825 --> 22:06.069
He's just gonna go
get another one,

22:06.093 --> 22:08.727
And that will lead him
right back here.

22:08.762 --> 22:11.162
Some knucklehead will see him
in that costume,

22:11.198 --> 22:12.631
And pick a fight.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.210
"Let's see how tough you are,
super-guy."

22:14.234 --> 22:16.301
It's possible, but...

22:16.336 --> 22:17.680
Is he having
any suicidal thoughts?

22:17.704 --> 22:18.637
No.

22:18.671 --> 22:19.638
And he's certainly not
a danger to others.

22:19.673 --> 22:22.174
He literally presented
saving a woman's life.

22:22.209 --> 22:23.874
I mean, he just doesn't
meet the criteria.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.811
For a psychiatric hold.

22:31.051 --> 22:32.984
Okay.

22:33.020 --> 22:33.785
There you go. Thank you.

22:33.821 --> 22:35.887
Dr. Rhodes? Dr. Rhodes, wait.

22:35.923 --> 22:38.823
Can you tell us about the
miracle patient, justin pepper?

22:38.859 --> 22:40.191
I... Please, anything.

22:40.227 --> 22:42.294
The people want to know.

22:43.964 --> 22:45.697
Well...

22:45.732 --> 22:48.700
The craniotomy we performed
was successful.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.779
His blood pressure is steady.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.937
The bleeding in his chest
and belly has slowed,

22:51.972 --> 22:53.004
So, fortunately,

22:53.040 --> 22:55.841
We've been able to back off
of the transfusions.

22:55.876 --> 22:57.075
Is he gonna pull through?

22:57.111 --> 22:59.211
Well, it is still
too early to tell,

22:59.245 --> 23:01.345
But we are fighting
the good fight.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.048
Now,
if all continues to go well,

23:03.082 --> 23:06.084
Ortho will be able to start
treating his bone fractures.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.352
Tomorrow.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.687
Now, if you'll excuse me,

23:08.722 --> 23:10.689
I've got to get back
to my patient.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.227
What the hell was that?

23:15.262 --> 23:16.928
My patient's doing well.

23:16.964 --> 23:18.475
I didn't see why
the press shouldn't know.

23:18.499 --> 23:21.133
Any interaction with the media
goes through me.

23:21.168 --> 23:24.236
I wouldn't have let you come out
here and grandstand like that.

23:24.271 --> 23:26.238
What if the patient dies?

23:26.273 --> 23:29.073
You gonna hold
a press conference then?

23:33.981 --> 23:36.081
Hey. Hey.

23:36.116 --> 23:37.883
Thoracic hardware's
stabilizing the spine.

23:37.918 --> 23:39.084
On the t4 fracture.

23:39.119 --> 23:40.462
Otherwise,
everything looks normal.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.352
Colon has descended.

23:41.388 --> 23:43.220
It could be a colonic
pseudo-obstruction.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.189
They are common in paraplegics.

23:44.224 --> 23:46.825
Yeah, but I don't see
any free air or fluid.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.827
The infection's
gotta be hiding somewhere.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.296
Let's try
a white blood cell scan.

23:51.331 --> 23:53.165
Tag some of his own
infection-fighting cells.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.933
With a tracer dye,
and see where they go.

23:54.968 --> 23:57.302
Let his immune system show us
where the hot spot is.

23:57.337 --> 23:58.470
Good idea. I'll get on it.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.405
Hey, nat. Yeah?

24:00.439 --> 24:03.175
When I pressed on
nick's abdomen,

24:03.209 --> 24:04.776
I was below
a sensory loss level.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.244
He shouldn't have felt anything.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.113
His abdominal wall is inflamed.

24:08.148 --> 24:10.247
When you applied pressure,
it fired off a signal.

24:10.284 --> 24:13.084
If anything, nick felt nausea,
but nothing tactile.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.419
He couldn't have.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.120
Yeah, I guess not.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.093
103.5

24:23.130 --> 24:25.363
it's gone up.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.966
What about my heart?

24:29.001 --> 24:30.168
Improvement?

24:30.204 --> 24:33.537
Unfortunately, it's not
responding the way I'd hoped.

24:36.577 --> 24:39.945
I googled myocarditis.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.347
Severe cases,
people needed heart transplants.

24:43.383 --> 24:45.015
Am I one of them?

24:45.052 --> 24:46.318
Possibly.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.224
But we're not there yet.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.358
There is another procedure
we can try...

24:54.394 --> 24:57.394
Ivig and plasmapheresis...

24:57.430 --> 24:59.965
But I have to warn you,
there are some risks.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.300
What do you think?

25:03.336 --> 25:05.503
If your heart stops
beating again,

25:05.539 --> 25:07.972
It may never come back.

25:11.345 --> 25:14.144
This procedure...

25:14.180 --> 25:15.347
Is it an operation?

25:15.381 --> 25:17.215
No, an infusion.

25:17.251 --> 25:19.149
It can be done right here
in the treatment room.

25:19.186 --> 25:21.086
I'll be with you the whole time.

25:24.858 --> 25:27.157
Okay.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.492
Okay.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.501
Gram-negative bacteria?
What is that?

25:37.537 --> 25:40.171
It's a common germ found in
water, soil, plants,

25:40.207 --> 25:42.340
The digestive tract...
Sometimes the skin.

25:42.376 --> 25:44.008
They don't always
lead to illness,

25:44.044 --> 25:46.211
But when they invade somewhere
they are not endemic to,

25:46.245 --> 25:47.512
You can get pretty sick.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.381
So what did these germs
get into?

25:49.416 --> 25:50.881
The muscles
surrounding your spine.

25:50.916 --> 25:53.184
There's an abscess
at the t4 vertebrae.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.119
Is it treatable? Yes.

25:55.155 --> 25:57.956
A surgeon will make an incision
in your back, and drain it.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.024
The hardware may need to
come out as well.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.226
Do it today,

26:01.260 --> 26:03.128
You'll likely feel better
immediately.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.195
We're good, babe.

26:04.231 --> 26:05.896
We're all good.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.365
There is something else, though.

26:07.401 --> 26:09.534
In addition to the bacteria,
the biopsy showed.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.869
A cluster of cells
that are not native.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.104
To the paraspinal muscles.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.285
The lab is still
trying to figure out.

26:15.309 --> 26:18.376
Exactly what these cells are,
but they shouldn't be there,

26:18.412 --> 26:20.979
Nor do they...
They come from my body.

26:21.014 --> 26:24.448
So, what are you guys
not telling us?

26:24.483 --> 26:26.383
They're stem cells.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.096
We've been going to mexico
to get injections.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.088
To reverse the paralysis.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.956
I'm gonna walk again.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.494
I know that look.

26:36.530 --> 26:38.329
You think we're crazy.

26:38.365 --> 26:39.930
Abandon
a state-of-the-art hospital.

26:39.965 --> 26:41.131
For a clinic in veracruz,

26:41.168 --> 26:44.068
But what nick needs,
we can't find here.

26:44.104 --> 26:46.938
And between the fda
and constantly changing politics.

26:46.972 --> 26:49.407
And social taboos, we just...
But leaving the country?

26:49.443 --> 26:51.476
There is no oversight.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.510
The bacteria that caused
your abscess.

26:53.546 --> 26:55.412
Likely came from a treatment.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.414
To ditch the wheelchair,
it's worth it.

26:57.450 --> 27:00.285
You touched nick's abdomen,
and he felt it.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.287
He felt it.

27:03.323 --> 27:05.590
I'm gonna walk again.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.203
And julia and I are gonna
get back to the life.

27:07.227 --> 27:11.195
That we dreamed of...
The one that she deserves.

27:11.231 --> 27:13.198
Okay.

27:13.233 --> 27:15.999
We'll set up the surgery
to have the abscess drained,

27:16.035 --> 27:18.102
Then go from there.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.372
Okay.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.552
Sir, is everything okay?

27:36.490 --> 27:38.289
Nurse? Somebody?

27:38.325 --> 27:42.459
My god. Breathe, sir, breathe.

27:42.495 --> 27:43.994
Breathe. Look at me, look at me.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.564
Two seconds in,
four seconds out.

27:46.599 --> 27:48.365
Slowly. I need some help!

27:48.401 --> 27:49.678
Here, here, here. What happened?

27:49.702 --> 27:51.403
He... he suddenly
grabbed his chest.

27:51.438 --> 27:53.704
And was short of breath.
All right, possible mi.

27:53.740 --> 27:57.242
We gotta move.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.977
Thank you.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.247
Edward, are you okay?

28:03.282 --> 28:06.017
Yeah, I think. He needed help.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.986
Okay, well, I saw.
You saved him.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.488
And look,
in a hospital gown, no less.

28:13.193 --> 28:15.427
Let me... let me help you
back to bed.

28:28.441 --> 28:30.508
What's happening?

28:33.113 --> 28:35.180
Asystole.
Crash cart and a chest tray.

28:35.215 --> 28:36.280
Got it.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.751
Take over compressions.

28:39.785 --> 28:42.119
Scalpels? You're operating here?

28:42.155 --> 28:44.189
There's no electrical activity
in the heart,

28:44.224 --> 28:45.789
So I can't shock it back.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.691
Internal cpr is my only option.

28:47.727 --> 28:49.427
My god.

28:58.438 --> 28:59.637
All right.

29:06.111 --> 29:08.812
Come on, beat.

29:08.849 --> 29:10.314
Amp of epi.

29:10.349 --> 29:11.483
One amp.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.553
Come on.

29:20.827 --> 29:22.727
Come on.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.236
All right, we've got a rhythm.

29:31.271 --> 29:34.439
He's back. He's back.

29:49.013 --> 29:56.085
Please tell me we are going.

30:03.928 --> 30:05.528
Quite a turnaround.

30:05.563 --> 30:07.463
I know, right?

30:07.498 --> 30:09.043
I was worried I wouldn't
be able to pull it off.

30:09.067 --> 30:11.167
As smoothly as you,
but it worked out.

30:11.202 --> 30:13.002
It's a new world for edward.

30:13.037 --> 30:14.637
Is it?

30:14.672 --> 30:18.507
Deception breaks
doctor-patient trust.

30:18.543 --> 30:22.144
We don't manipulate. We guide.

30:22.180 --> 30:26.415
Your ruse provided edward with
a moment of revelation,

30:26.451 --> 30:30.019
Not the framework
to build his future on.

30:30.054 --> 30:34.223
I mean, trust me, the costume is
not yet a thing of his past.

30:37.061 --> 30:40.162
Okay, discharge papers
for edward.

30:40.198 --> 30:42.231
I'm gonna need
a little more time.

30:42.266 --> 30:44.667
Okay.

30:51.909 --> 30:55.444
He feels cold.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.780
His blood pressure is very low.

30:57.815 --> 30:58.948
We're pushing meds,

30:58.983 --> 31:00.850
But his heart
is really struggling.

31:00.885 --> 31:02.818
To circulate blood
through his body.

31:04.989 --> 31:07.256
Justin is a climber.

31:07.291 --> 31:08.791
He always has been.

31:08.826 --> 31:10.593
Wow.

31:10.628 --> 31:12.228
A few years ago,

31:12.263 --> 31:16.765
He realized that rock faces
weren't enough.

31:16.801 --> 31:19.768
He loved his life.

31:19.804 --> 31:23.472
It's not over.

31:23.508 --> 31:25.808
But his heart will fail again,
won't it?

31:25.843 --> 31:27.276
If it does, I'll restart it.

31:27.311 --> 31:29.478
I'll keep restarting it.

31:29.514 --> 31:32.815
That last resuscitation was...

31:32.850 --> 31:34.283
So violent.

31:34.318 --> 31:37.887
Your son still has a chance.

31:37.922 --> 31:39.989
Does he?

31:40.024 --> 31:41.991
Please...

31:42.026 --> 31:44.627
No more heroics.

31:53.271 --> 31:55.638
Dr. Rhodes, I admit,

31:55.673 --> 31:58.174
I wanted you
to be the hero today.

31:58.209 --> 32:00.176
And I know you did too.

32:00.211 --> 32:03.312
But maybe it's time to stop.

32:14.058 --> 32:15.724
Hey. Hey.

32:18.729 --> 32:20.696
Got an update from
the neurosurgical floor.

32:20.731 --> 32:22.198
They just got started on nick.

32:22.233 --> 32:22.998
These foreign clinics...

32:23.034 --> 32:25.701
$30,000 a treatment,
sometimes more.

32:25.736 --> 32:28.637
The stem cells are shipped in
from all over the world.

32:28.673 --> 32:30.050
There's no way to prove
they're even authentic,

32:30.074 --> 32:31.874
And the success rates
on their websites...

32:31.909 --> 32:34.210
Totally unverifiable.
Scary, I know.

32:34.245 --> 32:37.046
But still, stem cell research
is making huge leaps.

32:37.081 --> 32:39.648
Yeah, maybe for
neurodegenerative diseases.

32:39.684 --> 32:41.884
But spinal cord injuries
like nick's?

32:41.919 --> 32:44.286
That tech is years away.

32:44.322 --> 32:45.654
Yeah.

32:49.894 --> 32:51.961
Just give me a second.

32:54.332 --> 32:57.132
Will...
Will, I need you in here.

32:57.168 --> 32:59.969
All right, I gotta go.

33:00.004 --> 33:03.038
Melody's a-line pulsatility
is fluctuating.

33:03.074 --> 33:05.941
This just start?
A couple minutes ago.

33:14.285 --> 33:16.051
Is my heart getting worse?

33:16.087 --> 33:17.853
No, better.

33:17.888 --> 33:20.055
101. Your temp's gone down.

33:20.091 --> 33:23.025
It means your body's
starting to fight back.

33:23.060 --> 33:24.660
I'm gonna be okay?

33:24.695 --> 33:26.228
Well, we'll get
another blood test,

33:26.264 --> 33:28.230
And if your white cell count
has improved as well,

33:28.266 --> 33:29.932
And your heart
continues to strengthen,

33:29.967 --> 33:32.601
Then I'll dial down the support.

33:32.637 --> 33:35.604
My god.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.007
God, I thought for sure...

33:39.310 --> 33:41.610
Thank you, april.

33:41.646 --> 33:45.281
You saved my life.

33:46.984 --> 33:49.018
God, I was so scared.

33:49.053 --> 33:51.920
You're good.

33:51.956 --> 33:53.956
I should call my parents.

33:53.991 --> 33:55.958
Of course.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.867
Yeah, I gotta say,
I did not expect.

34:04.902 --> 34:07.303
Ivig and plasmapheresis
to be so effective,

34:07.338 --> 34:09.705
Let alone that quickly.

34:09.739 --> 34:12.274
You know, maybe coupling it
with the cps...

34:12.310 --> 34:13.750
Or perhaps, you know,
maybe the meds.

34:13.777 --> 34:14.920
Just finally worked
on their own.

34:14.945 --> 34:16.145
You know what? Who cares.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.379
It worked. Yeah.

34:17.415 --> 34:19.982
Yeah? We got the win.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.150
Yeah...

34:22.186 --> 34:25.087
You don't seem excited.
No, I am.

34:25.121 --> 34:27.089
It's just a long day.

34:27.123 --> 34:30.092
Yeah, but a good one.

34:30.127 --> 34:31.793
Nice job.

35:05.811 --> 35:07.512
Neurosurgeon said
everything went well.

35:07.547 --> 35:09.292
Thi-I feel much better. Any
it's like night and day.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.182
Mind if I take a look?

35:15.055 --> 35:16.888
All good back there?

35:16.923 --> 35:19.024
Yeah.

35:19.059 --> 35:20.659
No surprises.

35:20.694 --> 35:23.328
Great.
Ready to put today behind me...

35:23.363 --> 35:25.330
no pun intended.

35:30.170 --> 35:33.405
Nick, when I was examining
your abdomen,

35:33.440 --> 35:35.573
You thought you felt something.

35:35.609 --> 35:37.375
You didn't, did you?

35:42.082 --> 35:46.184
Just my wife's eyes
desperately wishing I could.

35:46.219 --> 35:48.053
These treatments
you're getting in mexico...

35:48.088 --> 35:49.521
They're not working.

35:49.556 --> 35:50.655
And given your injury,

35:50.691 --> 35:53.558
The chances of paralysis
being reversed is almost zero.

35:53.593 --> 35:54.626
I can't give up.

35:54.661 --> 35:57.395
Stem cells can turn into
any part of the body.

35:57.431 --> 35:58.229
Instead of curing you,

35:58.265 --> 36:00.932
They could form
a mass or a tumor.

36:00.967 --> 36:02.934
Please, don't get
anymore injections.

36:02.969 --> 36:04.936
I have to.

36:04.971 --> 36:07.238
I love julia more than anything,

36:07.274 --> 36:09.507
But there are...

36:09.543 --> 36:13.244
Intimacies that I can't provide.

36:13.280 --> 36:16.414
Our bond is built on hope.
It's what holds us together.

36:16.450 --> 36:17.315
So it doesn't matter
if you believe.

36:17.350 --> 36:20.285
The treatments won't work.
Julia does.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.587
That's enough for me.
But you're risking your life.

36:22.622 --> 36:26.458
She is my life.

36:26.493 --> 36:29.227
I don't want you to share
your concerns with her.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.465
Okay.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.600
Good luck.

36:40.507 --> 36:41.940
Good luck?

36:41.975 --> 36:43.041
Ethan, are you kidding?

36:43.076 --> 36:46.444
Nat, I've met combat vets
who have been paralyzed.

36:46.480 --> 36:49.447
The feelings of inferiority
can be overwhelming.

36:49.483 --> 36:51.282
If you told them
a bottle of snake oil.

36:51.318 --> 36:53.218
Might help them walk again,

36:53.253 --> 36:55.420
They'd drink it every time.

36:55.455 --> 36:58.990
So you agree with
what nick's doing?

36:59.025 --> 37:01.426
I understand it, nat.

37:08.335 --> 37:10.168
It wasn't real.

37:10.203 --> 37:11.636
The situation was staged,

37:11.671 --> 37:14.639
But your response
was absolutely real.

37:14.674 --> 37:17.275
But I shouldn't have
tricked you.

37:17.310 --> 37:19.410
I thought building you up
from the inside.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.479
Would help you connect
to your true self,

37:21.515 --> 37:24.249
But I realize now...

37:24.284 --> 37:26.518
You've always known
exactly who you are.

37:26.553 --> 37:31.356
The real goal is making sure
others can see that.

37:31.391 --> 37:34.325
What's that?
A hospital volunteer vest.

37:34.361 --> 37:36.294
I know it's not as flashy
as your other outfit,

37:36.329 --> 37:40.131
But around here, there are
a lot of people in need.

37:40.167 --> 37:41.499
Seeing you in this,

37:41.535 --> 37:44.502
They'll know you're someone
they can depend on...

37:44.538 --> 37:46.571
Someone who can help them.

37:51.711 --> 37:53.344
Think about it.

38:18.705 --> 38:20.071
Hey.

38:22.275 --> 38:24.475
Surgery?

38:24.511 --> 38:28.046
I have procedure room 3 open.

38:28.081 --> 38:31.049
I'll schedule you in.
Come on up.

38:57.577 --> 39:00.111
April?

39:00.146 --> 39:01.713
April...

39:08.722 --> 39:12.523
I saw your name
on the list for a d&c.

39:18.665 --> 39:21.266
It was my ultrasound.

39:21.301 --> 39:23.268
There wa... there wasn't...

39:27.307 --> 39:30.642
I-I don't... I don't know when.

39:30.677 --> 39:35.647
I-I don't... I don't know why...

39:39.152 --> 39:41.552
My baby's...

39:41.588 --> 39:44.122
Heart...

39:44.157 --> 39:45.223
It stopped...

39:45.258 --> 39:47.158
It's okay.

39:51.431 --> 39:54.399
It stopped beating.

39:55.305 --> 40:01.513
