# I'm trading my home for the road again

00:22.280 --> 00:26.433
# Singing my songs with an old best friend

00:28.080 --> 00:31.960
# Running around with a child's mind... #

00:32.080 --> 00:33.559
Whoo!

00:33.680 --> 00:37.833
# ...A man gets lucky

00:37.960 --> 00:39.394

00:47.560 --> 00:49.198
Hm.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.989
- You're excited!
- Damn right I am.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.031
Finally got a lead on Iorek.

00:55.160 --> 00:59.119
He might not be the same bear.
The Iorek I knew...

00:59.240 --> 01:01.629
- Some crazy seal-hunter...
- (FLAMES ROAR)

01:01.760 --> 01:05.230
...got him drunk,
tricked him out of his armour.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.878
An armoured bear is nothing
without his armour.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.990
Hester!

01:13.120 --> 01:14.713
I'm right here.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.751
What do you see?

01:16.880 --> 01:20.271
Looks like we're not the only ones
heading to Trollesund.

01:20.400 --> 01:24.109
Lee, are you sure Iorek
will want us making trouble?

01:24.240 --> 01:26.834
That bear saved our lives, Hester.
We owe him trouble.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.119
Hey!

03:33.480 --> 03:36.393
This is an oil port.
There's no smoking on the quay.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.511
Then I nearly made a horrible mistake.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.631
Lee Scoresby, aeronaut for hire.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.319
Tell me, who are all these people here?

03:42.440 --> 03:44.909
My question exactly.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.190
New arrivals arouse suspicion.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.789
I did hear a rumour that interested me.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.831
Rumour of a bear.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.553
Any truth to that?

03:54.680 --> 03:57.479
Yes, I heard a rumour, too,
of an aeronaut

03:57.600 --> 04:00.319
who creates bedlam wherever he goes.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.314
Any truth to that?

04:14.680 --> 04:16.637
- (SIGHS) Here we go again.
- Friendly place.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.909
Yeah.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.394
No, it's not.

04:19.519 --> 04:22.353
Can we just stay out of trouble?

04:22.480 --> 04:23.914
Gyptians.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.156
Never seen them so far north.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.591
FARDER: The spy-fly will have reached
Mrs Coulter by now.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.233
Our business here must be in haste.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.078
JOHN: I don't like it here either.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.714
Go see the witches' consul,
get whatever help you can,

04:35.840 --> 04:37.558
and we leave here as fast as possible.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.593
It's been 40 years since
I saw Serafina last.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.597
She might not like what she sees.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.394
I remember you as a younger man, Coram.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.796
You weren't much to look at even then.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.240
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

04:52.080 --> 04:54.469
You're sure you should take the girl?

04:54.600 --> 04:56.910
Something tells me I'll need her.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.231
PAN: Quite something, all this.

05:03.360 --> 05:06.273
My whole life I've wanted to be here,
and now that I'm here,

05:06.400 --> 05:08.516
I'm not so sure I want to be.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.789
FARDER: Lyra!

05:12.040 --> 05:13.360
Lyra.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.959
A word, please.

05:17.320 --> 05:21.075
I need to know if I can trust in
your readings of the alethiometer.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.554
How do you decipher it?

05:22.680 --> 05:24.591
I kind of feel them or see them.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.473
It's like...like going down
a ladder at night.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.637
(SHOUTING)

05:29.760 --> 05:32.878
You put your foot down,
and there's another rung.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.311
Well, I put my mind down,
and there's another meaning.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.319
I sort of...sense what they mean.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.200
It's got a trick in it.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.880
- Sort of like focusing your eyes.
- Ah.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.072
So, say you wanted to ask
the alethiometer

05:49.200 --> 05:51.669
what your parents are doing now?

05:51.800 --> 05:54.030
- Well, the Madonna is Mrs Coulter.
- Oh.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.231
The Madonna, is it?

05:56.360 --> 05:59.273
And for Asriel,
it would be the globe.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.678
So, I think of my parents
when I put the hand there.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.998
And then I go for the ant,
because that means busy.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.715
But how do you know
what these meanings are? Hmm?

06:16.680 --> 06:19.479
The Magisterium. Put it away, Lyra.

06:27.680 --> 06:32.277
You understand the man
we're going to see is important?

06:33.320 --> 06:34.435
Yes.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.678
The Witch Consul is a link between
the human world and the witches.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.155
He will decide whether
to pass our message on.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.635
And we need the witches.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.229
Yes, but he'll want to know everything.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.510
The Consul is the only way
to contact the witches,

06:47.640 --> 06:50.280
and he must trust us first,
but if he does,

06:50.400 --> 06:54.553
a witch called Serafina Pekkala
will surely come to our aid.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.399
With her help,
we will find the children.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.875
- You mean she'll lead us to Roger?
- Yes.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.399
Just follow my lead.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.716
Keep that thing hidden, OK?

07:05.200 --> 07:06.520
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

07:09.800 --> 07:11.871
How can I help you, Farder Coram?

07:12.000 --> 07:16.278
I met a witch some years ago
in the fen country of eastern Anglia.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.471
Her name was Serafina Pekkala.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.591
I wish to get a message to her.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.117
I'm aware of your relationship
with Serafina Pekkala, Farder Coram.

07:26.440 --> 07:30.911
I represent a number of Gyptian families
who have lost children.

07:31.040 --> 07:35.511
We believe there is an organisation
that is capturing these children,

07:35.640 --> 07:38.393
ours and others,
and taking them north.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.194
We need her help to get them free.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.270
Well...

07:44.800 --> 07:48.475
You realise that relations
between the witches

07:48.600 --> 07:51.797
and the authorities

07:51.920 --> 07:54.719
are...perfectly cordial.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.835
It is my job to keep them that way.

07:58.960 --> 08:03.477
You refer...to the Magisterium. Hmm?

08:06.200 --> 08:08.840
This fight is not ours.

08:08.960 --> 08:12.112
They are stealing children.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.278
This is war for all of us.

08:16.320 --> 08:20.439
And I know Serafina
will want to be part of it.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.350
The children do not remain here for long.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.835
They are taken some distance inland.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.951
Do you know what happens
to them there?

08:33.080 --> 08:36.960
I've heard variously
of the Maystadt Process,

08:37.080 --> 08:40.311
or an...intercision.

08:40.440 --> 08:44.513
The process is shrouded in secrecy,
but the rumours are disturbing.

08:44.640 --> 08:49.510
There's a reason why you don't see a child
on the streets of Trollesund.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.957
We, too, have felt the effects
of missing children.

08:54.080 --> 08:59.712
Then I will leave you to let Serafina
know what we ask of her.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.194
Come.

09:04.960 --> 09:10.194
I understand you are in possession
of an alethiometer.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.995
I have eyes everywhere
in Trollesund.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.595
Yes.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.950
May I look at it?

09:28.560 --> 09:30.198
It's exquisite.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.518

Actually...

09:39.520 --> 09:40.590
...] can read it.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.239
You are very wise to say so.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.676

09:48.800 --> 09:50.791
I just can.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.349
Well...

09:53.480 --> 09:56.552
I wonder if I might ask to see you do so.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.229
Down here,

09:59.360 --> 10:01.556
there are many sprigs of cloud-pine.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.791
Which one belongs to
Serafina Pekkala?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.958
I can summon the witches
through cloud-pine.

10:14.680 --> 10:18.435
Each spray of cloud-pine
is specific to a witch.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.039
(MECHANISM CLICKS)

10:21.440 --> 10:25.991

Serafina Pekkala's?

11:10.480 --> 11:14.474

to take away with you.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.076

11:23.240 --> 11:24.719
...she will come.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.398
Dr Lanselius,
may I ask you something?

11:30.520 --> 11:31.555
Of course.

11:31.680 --> 11:35.355
What question should we be asking you
that we are not?

11:40.480 --> 11:41.993
You're weak.

11:42.120 --> 11:46.796
You may have heart,
but the Magisterium have muscle.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.279
I would ask where I could obtain the
services of an armoured bear.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.076
I understood the armoured bears
answered to nobody.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.874
There is at least one who does.
An exile.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.077
He shamed his people,
but be warned -

12:04.200 --> 12:06.874
his skill with metal
makes him useful to the town.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.391
They don't like strangers knowing about
him or interfering in his affairs.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.478
You'll find him beside Einarsson's Bar.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.798
But to get him away will take some doing.

why you won't,

17:26.319 --> 17:28.630
and why I go north tomorrow?

17:30.960 --> 17:33.031
I have Lord Asriel.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.990
You have Asriel?

17:39.120 --> 17:40.599
In a jail...

17:41.760 --> 17:44.639
...controlled by bears,
who are, in this case...

17:45.960 --> 17:47.633
...controlled by me.

17:52.720 --> 17:56.236
I will travel to the North,
and I will give him to you

17:56.360 --> 17:58.670
as an act of service...

18:00.000 --> 18:03.436
...and, in return,
you'd allow me to pursue our project

18:03.560 --> 18:05.358
until its end.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.951
And you will allow me
to ask one question

18:11.080 --> 18:13.230
of Fra Pavel...

18:13.360 --> 18:15.670
...and his alethiometer.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.634
That seems like a high price.

18:19.760 --> 18:23.435
For Asriel, it's cheap.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.594
Now, shall we sit...

18:28.640 --> 18:30.472
...and discuss how to proceed?

18:30.600 --> 18:31.920
Please.

18:35.320 --> 18:38.039
FARDER: Lyra, the way you
spoke to that bear,

18:38.160 --> 18:40.754
he could have torn your throat out.

18:40.880 --> 18:44.316
And you could've imprisoned me
and sold me back to Mrs Coulter.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.159
I know who to trust, Farder Coram.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.955
But if you're wrong,
you could do yourself damage.

18:51.080 --> 18:55.950
I'd do myself...more damage
not trusting anyone.

19:00.320 --> 19:03.153
What happened between
you and Serafina?

19:05.800 --> 19:07.711
We loved each other.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.634
You loved a witch?

19:13.160 --> 19:14.559
We had a child.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.839
A son.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.519
There was an epidemic.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.313
There was nothing we could do.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.750
He died.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.679
And she wanted to rip the world apart...

19:29.360 --> 19:31.476
...fly to Yambe-Akka,

19:31.600 --> 19:33.637
fight her...

19:33.760 --> 19:36.957
...if that's what it
took to get him back.

19:37.080 --> 19:39.993
I wanted to mourn in peace.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.111
Haven't seen her since...

19:44.640 --> 19:46.950
(TEARFULLY) ...after we buried my boy.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.477
I'm so sorry, Farder Coram.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.835
It was a long time ago.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.835
Say what you like about the North,

20:30.960 --> 20:33.918
wherever you go is guaranteed
to be a bar full of men

20:34.040 --> 20:35.917
who should be at home but aren't.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.993
Any gentlemen in the mood
for a game of hazard?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.190
No?

20:44.680 --> 20:46.432
How about a game of flippity-flop?

20:46.560 --> 20:47.755
It's real simple.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.279
There are three pots.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.472
A flip pot, flop pot and a game pot.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.671
As long as you can stake a pot,
you can play.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.074
Will you join me in a glass of hot rum?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.474
My round.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.269
I'm just looking for some conversation,
you see.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.994
What are you all afraid of?

21:14.120 --> 21:16.794
That I'll learn your secrets?

21:18.200 --> 21:21.397
That I'm...grubbing for shady business?

21:21.520 --> 21:22.669
I'm not.

21:23.960 --> 21:27.078
I am simply after a bear.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.955
It's kind of royal-looking,
fancy armour.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.918
I know. Strange for these parts.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.272
You know what a bear looks like,
don't you?

21:40.400 --> 21:43.631
Thick coat, big teeth, cute little nose.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.154
Right.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.714
Well, at this point,

21:47.840 --> 21:50.150
you're either being ignorant
or wilfully obstructive.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.429
(YELLS)

21:51.560 --> 21:52.994
What are you thinking?!

21:53.120 --> 21:54.918
(GASPS)

21:55.040 --> 21:56.314
You started the fight,

21:56.440 --> 21:59.193
- now you're losing the fight!
- I know what you're going to say.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.196
(YELLS)

22:00.320 --> 22:01.549
Come on, up!

22:01.680 --> 22:03.637
Lee, your turn! Do something!

22:03.760 --> 22:04.955
(GRUNTS)

22:05.080 --> 22:06.309
OK, you gotta kick.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.078
That's right, kick again!

22:08.200 --> 22:09.315
Bottle!

22:09.440 --> 22:10.919
(GLASS SMASHES)

22:12.960 --> 22:15.759
That was nice! Love it! More of that!

22:15.880 --> 22:16.836
No!

22:16.960 --> 22:17.916
Hey! You almost got me!

22:18.040 --> 22:19.917
(GRUNTS)

22:20.040 --> 22:21.792
Nice kick!

22:21.920 --> 22:23.797
All right, we're having fun now.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.191
Come on!

22:27.320 --> 22:29.277
- (BLOWS THUD)
- Hey, Lee!

22:29.400 --> 22:30.993
You got this!

22:32.200 --> 22:33.599
What are you doing, going high?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.518
You can't go high.
They're going to get you!

22:35.640 --> 22:37.358
- Whoa!
- Hold him!

22:37.480 --> 22:39.710
- (GASPS)
- Throw him out!

22:41.440 --> 22:43.954
Quit asking about bears, Aeronaut.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.310
Well, that showed them.

22:46.440 --> 22:47.839
I'd like to think I made my point.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.792
And what point was that?

22:49.920 --> 22:52.275
Three watches and a wallet.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.714
I've wanted to visit this room
for quite some time.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.436
He's normally very careful
of who he allows up.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.954
You understand anything you ask me
may take weeks of study.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.276
I want a guarantee that,
whatever you find out,

23:23.400 --> 23:25.277
I'll be the first to know.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.353
What is your question?

23:42.600 --> 23:44.113
It's a simple one.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.238
Who is Lyra Belacqua?

23:50.840 --> 23:54.674
- Surely, you of all...
- Just ask the question, Fra Pavel.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.874
LEE: Has anyone seen a bear?

24:13.560 --> 24:15.233
LYRA: What do you want with a bear?

24:17.840 --> 24:19.239
You're bleeding.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.714
Hazard of the job.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.239
And what job do you do?

24:22.360 --> 24:23.430
I'm in aeronautics.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.473
- What part of being an aeronaut...?
- Let me give you a tip, kid.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.874
Never upset a seagull.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.559
You're not serious.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.398
Not if I can help it.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.353
Will he want to see you, this bear?

24:35.680 --> 24:38.035
I hope so.
You know where he is, don't you?

24:38.160 --> 24:40.674
- The town's no place for Iorek.
- How do you know him?

24:40.800 --> 24:42.632
Well, she's just a sprung box, isn't she?

24:42.760 --> 24:43.989
She just keeps asking questions.

24:44.120 --> 24:47.317
Lee Scoresby.
Can you tell me where to find him?

24:47.440 --> 24:49.556
I'm just following her lead.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.233
What is it about him?

24:53.360 --> 24:54.509
What's keeping him trapped?

24:54.640 --> 24:57.154
Kid, I'll tell you that when you tell me
what you know.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.633
Another time.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.034
Why won't you tell me?

25:02.160 --> 25:03.753
Because we need him,

25:03.880 --> 25:05.837
and I'm not sure that
you won't take him from us.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.911
FARDER: Serafina once told me
of a prophecy about a child.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.872
I think it could be Lyra.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.071
People see something in her.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.760
You should have seen Dr Lanselius.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.394
The look on his face when
she answered his questions.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.318
- He looked...
- How?

25:26.440 --> 25:27.430
Greedy.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.073
Greedy?

25:29.200 --> 25:32.830
There are things going on, John,
that we do not understand.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.395
The further north we go,
the more we must watch her.

25:35.520 --> 25:36.840
(SHRILL SCREECHING)

25:36.960 --> 25:38.553
Ah.

25:38.680 --> 25:41.320
- A spy.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.472
The Witch Consul must have
passed on our message.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.637
Serafina's daemon.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.234
So it's true.

25:50.360 --> 25:53.398
The witches do have the power
to send their daemons from them.

26:10.640 --> 26:14.679
I have...changed much

26:14.800 --> 26:17.076
since last you saw me, Kaisa.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.192
You have, Coram van Texel.

26:23.680 --> 26:27.389
May I introduce John Faa,

26:27.520 --> 26:29.511
king of the western Gyptians?

26:29.640 --> 26:33.634
This is Kaisa,
daemon of Serafina Pekkala,

26:33.760 --> 26:35.797
queen of the Lake Enara clan.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.719
Serafina sends you happiness...

26:38.840 --> 26:40.114
How far away is she?

26:40.240 --> 26:43.915
...and she asks if you have come
to make war.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.311
If it takes war...

26:48.440 --> 26:50.511
...to get our children back,

26:50.640 --> 26:52.916
then we are ready to wage it.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.750
- I'd hope the witches would help.
- Not all will.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.394
Some clans are working with
the Oblation Board.

27:00.520 --> 27:03.194
Those who search for Dust.

27:03.320 --> 27:08.110
And where are they now,
these Dust-hunters?

27:08.240 --> 27:10.390
Four days northeast of here.
They call it the Station.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.273
The witches call it Bolvangar.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.470
Bolvangar?

27:17.240 --> 27:18.594
Translated, that means...

27:19.960 --> 27:21.314
...fields of evil.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.909
Can you take us there?

27:24.040 --> 27:29.513
Serafina Pekkala will support you
in whatever route your path takes.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.910
LYRA: What do you think it is, Pan,

27:57.040 --> 27:59.873
makes it look like that?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.991
I don't know,

28:02.120 --> 28:04.839
but it's... It's amazing.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.719
Do you think that's what
Dust looks like?

28:15.720 --> 28:17.552
There's something in it.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.436
Not quite...

28:21.560 --> 28:24.154
It looks like a city.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.029
It's gone.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.155
Maybe it's the alethiometer,

28:39.280 --> 28:41.191
telling us where to go,

28:41.320 --> 28:43.231
where Roger is.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.033
Maybe.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.391
Do you think he's cold?

28:50.640 --> 28:52.551
I hope not.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.478
I'm the same.

28:56.680 --> 29:01.117
I find myself thinking about Billy
at the strangest times.

29:02.800 --> 29:06.350
Even found myself thinking about him
on the toilet this morning.

29:09.240 --> 29:11.151
Heard you met a bear.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.873
Yeah.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.115
Fun?

29:15.840 --> 29:17.399
Scary?

29:19.040 --> 29:20.792
Confusing.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.029
Definitely not what I expected.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.871
We're going to get them back, Tony.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.554
I know.

29:40.440 --> 29:43.273
We will do whatever it takes
to get them back.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.993
HESTER: Hey, Lee, can we take a break?

30:01.120 --> 30:04.476
We've been searching for hours.
I don't think he's here...

30:05.640 --> 30:07.916
Iorek Byrnison!

30:11.480 --> 30:12.754
Uh...

30:12.880 --> 30:14.757
It's been some time.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.518
What are you doing here?

30:16.640 --> 30:19.109
IOREK: It hasn't been some time.

30:19.240 --> 30:23.199
It's been three years. (GROWLS)

30:23.320 --> 30:25.038
Three years, long as all that?

30:25.160 --> 30:30.030
It has not been a good three years.
(GROWLS)

30:31.200 --> 30:33.157
We want to help, Iorek. Can we help?

30:34.520 --> 30:37.558
I owe you. We both know it.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.835
And how can you help me?

30:44.040 --> 30:46.919
Some look good naked. You do not.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.600
Who has it?

30:49.720 --> 30:51.358
Your armour?

30:51.480 --> 30:56.429
I am drunk, Lee,
and not behaving as a bear should,

30:56.560 --> 30:58.233
and I'd rather you leave me.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.271
And what if I don't want to go?

31:02.040 --> 31:04.350
You know, when I see an old friend,

31:04.480 --> 31:06.835
I'm inclined to tell him where I've been,

31:06.960 --> 31:09.110
adventures I've had.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.072
I have done things...

31:12.240 --> 31:14.072
...I can't talk about.

31:14.200 --> 31:17.397
I've done some things I'm not too keen
on people knowing either.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.757
Tell me what you've done.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.236
We wouldn't judge you,
couldn't judge you.

31:25.360 --> 31:29.240
And what if I desire to be judged?

31:30.360 --> 31:32.112
Don't let him go.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.709
We came here just for you, Iorek!

31:34.840 --> 31:37.150
Then you should leave, Lee,

31:37.280 --> 31:40.318
for I neither asked you to come,

31:40.440 --> 31:42.716
nor do I want you to stay.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.080
It's not often we get
customers waiting for us.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.237
You haven't got that lucky,
Mr Sysselman.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.953
I'm not handing myself in.

32:16.080 --> 32:17.673
Oh, is that right?

32:18.720 --> 32:20.358
(BOTH LAUGH)

32:23.000 --> 32:24.320
How can I help?

32:24.440 --> 32:26.351
I'm representing the bear.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.153
The bear's case is closed.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.840
Correction, I am representing
myself via the bear.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.634
The trouble is, you confiscated
my property instead of his.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.831
Yes, I doubt that, Mr Scoresby.

32:35.960 --> 32:36.995
This is why I've been seeking him.

32:37.120 --> 32:40.636
Now, this is a bill of sale stating that

32:40.760 --> 32:43.400
I, not Iorek Byrnison,
own his armour.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.796
He lost it to me in a game of cards,
you see.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.877
I've come back to reclaim it.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.991
The bear's armour belongs
to the Magisterium.

32:58.760 --> 32:59.989
Ah, yes.

33:00.120 --> 33:03.795
He is paying off a blood debt.

33:03.920 --> 33:08.118
Ha. Well, yes,
this document is correct

33:08.240 --> 33:10.197
as far as the Crime And Debt Act

33:10.320 --> 33:14.314
chapter 3, paragraph 4.5
is concerned. The trouble is,

33:14.440 --> 33:15.874
the Crime And Debt Act is superseded

33:16.000 --> 33:18.435
in this circumstance by
the Possession Of Goods Act

33:18.560 --> 33:21.632
part 3, subsection 4,
Miscellaneous Provisions,

33:21.760 --> 33:24.878
which clearly states, and I quote,
"The possession of valuables

33:25.000 --> 33:26.798
- "belongs to..."
- Please!

33:26.920 --> 33:29.878
Do not doubt my intelligence, Mr Scoresby.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.957
It's not your intelligence I doubt,
Mr Sysselman.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.957
Who paid you to write this

33:34.080 --> 33:36.515
and how much will it cost me
for you to rewrite it?

33:36.640 --> 33:39.871
Now, you be careful what
you accuse me of.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.079
Not even money'll work.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.079
They've got you well controlled,
haven't they?

33:47.920 --> 33:49.513
Whatever you're accusing me of...

33:49.640 --> 33:52.075
Now, the North, as I understand it,

33:52.200 --> 33:55.192
has always been a place for people
who didn't fit in or didn't want to.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.391
The Magisterium has been
trying to gain power

33:57.520 --> 33:58.919
out here for a generation.

33:59.040 --> 34:03.318
No-one ever actually let them in
until, perhaps, now.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.833
Be very careful.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.434
He's a bear.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.630
He can't be a slave.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.670
Not to you,

34:16.800 --> 34:20.395
the Magisterium or anyone.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.152
Shame on you, Mr Sysselman.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.831
MRS COULTER: I believe I have been helpful

34:47.960 --> 34:51.032
in the disposal of Iorek Byrnison

34:51.159 --> 34:53.549
and helping you take your rightful throne.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.717
I'm perfectly prepared.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.630
My Northern king...

35:14.640 --> 35:16.392
We're leaving?

35:16.520 --> 35:18.193
Yes. The witches have agreed to help us.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.870
But...but we haven't got Iorek.
The Witch Consul said we need Iorek.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.119
He also warned there was little chance
of getting him away.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.959
You don't know what awaits us out there.

35:29.080 --> 35:31.356
With Iorek on our side,
we stand a chance.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.357
Lyra, we've just had a good word

35:33.480 --> 35:35.994
that your father
has been taken prisoner

35:36.120 --> 35:37.918
and is guarded by armoured bears.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.429
The Magisterium are everywhere.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.880
We can't dare wait.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.593
They have Asriel?

35:43.720 --> 35:45.154
They do.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.910
Then all the more reason to have
an armoured bear on our side!

35:49.040 --> 35:50.553
We don't want him.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.717
We made enquiries.

35:52.840 --> 35:56.595
Iorek is being punished for fighting
and wrecking this town. He was drunk.

35:56.720 --> 36:00.031
That's the only reason they managed
to prise his armour from him.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.673
He is a savage.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.438
Lyra, that is not necessary!

36:04.560 --> 36:06.278
Let her do it.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.871
(MECHANISM CLICKS)

36:20.920 --> 36:23.560
The alethiometer says that they got
him drunk and tricked him.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.320
No bear would normally drink spirits.

36:26.440 --> 36:29.432
JOHN: He tore through the police house
and the bank.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.312
The only reason they didn't shoot him

36:31.440 --> 36:33.511
was because of his skills with metal.

36:33.640 --> 36:36.075
Why don't you check your alethiometer

36:36.200 --> 36:37.679
to see whether
I'm telling the truth now?

36:37.800 --> 36:39.916
You don't need to,
because you know it.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.589
I choose who I fight alongside,

36:43.720 --> 36:45.677
and that is my final word.

36:57.040 --> 37:01.477
I heard you had a visitor.
What did Mrs Coulter want with you?

37:01.600 --> 37:03.796
You think I can tell you that?

37:03.920 --> 37:06.150
It's more than my position is worth.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.953
Come now, Ratty.

37:08.080 --> 37:11.198
You mistake me for someone
who cares about your position.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.194
Remember...

37:15.680 --> 37:17.671

37:19.040 --> 37:21.236
Your filthy predilections.

37:22.560 --> 37:25.439
And the trouble they've caused.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.955
You shouldn't do this to me.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.190
Hmm.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.593
I need an answer...

37:47.000 --> 37:48.957
...from the alethiometer.

37:52.440 --> 37:56.434
I wish to know
what Grumman discovered.

37:56.560 --> 37:57.789
That is a dissident.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.036
That is heretical.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.959
It's my job to understand heretics,
is it not?

38:03.080 --> 38:05.071
Then ask the cardinal for his permission
before demanding...

38:05.200 --> 38:06.634
I'm not asking the cardinal.

38:06.760 --> 38:09.798
I'm asking you, Ratty.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.672
How can I get what
Grumman discovered?

38:11.800 --> 38:14.553
You have neither his permission
nor Father MacPhail's.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.159
I don't need his permission!

38:16.280 --> 38:18.954
I just need your consent!

38:19.080 --> 38:21.151
Will you deny it?

38:22.520 --> 38:26.673
Or must I expose you...

38:26.800 --> 38:28.438
...to the world?

38:31.640 --> 38:33.074
Because I will...

38:34.480 --> 38:35.959
...out of spite...

38:38.200 --> 38:40.111
...if I don't get my own way.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.998
I rethought it.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.589
The question I want to ask -

38:47.720 --> 38:51.111
how can I find
what Grumman discovered?

There is one person in this town
who knows that bear.

Pan, you're a genius!

39:22.600 --> 39:25.592
Hey, can you remind me
why we're here again?

39:25.720 --> 39:30.556
It's the only place in town with a bed
and a halfway decent plate of scran.

39:30.680 --> 39:34.594
It worries me that bacon is more important
to you than survival.

39:34.720 --> 39:39.237
And by the way, you are aware
everyone is looking at us?

39:39.360 --> 39:42.034
- It's time to leave.
- Yeah, we're not leaving without Iorek.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.798

Thank you.

39:49.480 --> 39:50.709
Every minute we spend here

39:50.840 --> 39:53.309
- longer than we should...
- That bear saved my life, Hester.

39:53.440 --> 39:56.193
And we came here to repay him,
and he told us

39:56.320 --> 39:58.596
- he didn't need our help.
- Who didn't need your help?

39:58.720 --> 40:02.190
You know, kid, much as I like you,
now is not the time.

40:03.680 --> 40:06.433
I represent John Faa,
ruler of the western Gyptians,

40:06.560 --> 40:08.471
and we would like to hire you.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.795
You can't afford me.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.389
Mr Scoresby, the Magisterium
is stealing children.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.670
We have to get them back,
and it occurred to us

40:14.800 --> 40:17.155
that the help of an aeronaut
might be of some use.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.510
We'd be grateful for your services.

40:19.640 --> 40:20.994
We pay in gold.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.679
I know what you're fighting, kid.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.360
You're going to lose.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.079
Do you play cards?

40:28.200 --> 40:30.476
(LAUGHS) What do you know about cards?

40:30.600 --> 40:33.752
I used to play them
with the scholars where I lived.

40:33.880 --> 40:37.271
They were much cleverer than me,
but I generally won.

40:37.400 --> 40:41.519
I learned that sometimes a bad hand
can be your greatest weapon.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.233
Sometimes, when there is no hope,

40:43.360 --> 40:46.716
it can allow you to bluff magnificently.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.956
Remind me never to play cards
with you.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.471

40:52.600 --> 40:55.274
You need the bear, and I'm secondary.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.237

41:00.560 --> 41:02.437
He's obliged to this town.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.358
Iorek's going nowhere.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.312
He's an armoured bear.

41:06.440 --> 41:08.113
What could they...?

41:09.720 --> 41:11.393
They got his armour.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.478
Hey, you got there without
needing my help.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.311
Why's his armour so important?

41:19.400 --> 41:22.995
War is the sea he swims in
and the air he breathes.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.554
No.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.318
Without his armour...

41:27.560 --> 41:30.712
His armour means as much to him
as Hester here does to me.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.353
His armour's like his daemon?

41:34.480 --> 41:37.438
His soul is in those pieces of metal.

will have it well hidden.

I'm outgunned in this town,

48:05.440 --> 48:06.953
Having fun? I hope so.

48:07.080 --> 48:08.673
(GROANS)

48:08.800 --> 48:10.598
Just turn around.

48:10.720 --> 48:13.075
Walk away with me.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.395
Please.

48:14.520 --> 48:16.909
LEE: She's just a kid,
but she talks some sense.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.953
These people need our help, Iorek.
Let's go give it.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.639
This isn't who you are.

48:24.520 --> 48:28.070
(REVERBERATING ROAR)

48:39.400 --> 48:40.754
(SIGHS)

49:00.280 --> 49:01.998
We're packed up.

49:02.120 --> 49:03.872
We're really going.

49:04.000 --> 49:08.358
Lyra, trust me when I tell you,
it's within us to beat these people.

49:08.480 --> 49:10.517
Course it is,

49:10.640 --> 49:14.315
but would you mind if I brought
along a little extra help all the same?

49:17.360 --> 49:20.716
- How did you...?
- He's been mistreated and tricked,

49:20.840 --> 49:22.069
just like the Gyptians have been,

49:22.200 --> 49:25.750
always mistreated and tricked.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.518
He's practically Gyptian.

49:27.640 --> 49:29.836
- Just like I am.
- Lyra...

49:29.960 --> 49:31.997
You cannot constantly be
disobeying me.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.714
I agree.
Who wants a disobedient kid?

49:34.840 --> 49:36.035
But she's right.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.436
He's a good bear.
You won't have any trouble

49:38.560 --> 49:39.994
as long as you pay him.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.679
And me.

49:41.800 --> 49:43.996
And who's this?

49:46.800 --> 49:47.995
You told me he'd asked for me.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.350
No, I told you he'd be grateful for you.

49:50.480 --> 49:53.313
I was working on him already
being grateful. You've entirely

49:53.440 --> 49:56.034
- messed up my sales pitch.
- What did I tell you

49:56.160 --> 49:58.231
about how I play cards?

50:02.240 --> 50:04.038
Lee Scoresby.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.753
I can fight and I can fly.

50:05.880 --> 50:08.030
I don't come cheap,
and neither should I.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.197
You'll get gold for gold.

50:10.320 --> 50:13.438
And you are going to need
all the help you can get.

50:15.560 --> 50:21.158
He's an aeronaut. He has his own balloon.
He could be useful.

50:24.040 --> 50:28.034
Well, then,
welcome aboard, Lee Scoresby.

50:28.160 --> 50:31.118
We have a long and dangerous
journey ahead.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.193
Iofur?

51:05.480 --> 51:07.118
(CLATTERING)

51:08.520 --> 51:10.511
Iofur?

51:14.360 --> 51:15.873
Iofur.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.436
I appreciate the need to keep
our meeting a secret,

51:19.560 --> 51:22.552
but it will be difficult
if I can't see you.

51:22.680 --> 51:24.318
Don't waste my time!

51:24.440 --> 51:25.874
No, no, of course.

51:27.280 --> 51:29.237
You... You are right.

51:30.400 --> 51:31.435
You are a king,

51:31.560 --> 51:33.471
and I am impertinent.

51:33.600 --> 51:35.193
I ama king,

51:35.320 --> 51:37.436
and you are not a queen.

51:41.640 --> 51:46.350
And we are very grateful
for your help in capturing Asriel.

51:46.480 --> 51:50.713
Many have tried,
and only you have succeeded.

51:50.840 --> 51:51.830
And yet I...

51:51.960 --> 51:55.476
Yet you doubt me.

51:55.600 --> 51:56.874
King Raknison,

51:57.000 --> 52:00.994
I was a great help in aiding you
in the disposal of Iorek Byrnison

52:01.120 --> 52:03.270
and helping you take your throne.

52:03.400 --> 52:07.553
And I agreed to capture Asriel
to repay my debt.

52:08.680 --> 52:12.514
But he is now my prisoner
in my dungeon,

52:12.640 --> 52:15.837
and I will do with him as I choose.

52:17.720 --> 52:19.677
Well, perhaps, then...

52:20.840 --> 52:24.117
...as an envoy from my people...

52:25.520 --> 52:28.433
...] could offer you something that
might be of worth to you.

52:28.560 --> 52:33.396
And in return, you may permit me
to oversee how you deal with Asriel...

52:33.520 --> 52:37.195
I am a king! I have all I need.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.391
I'm talking...

52:39.520 --> 52:41.716
...of a baptism.

52:41.840 --> 52:43.319
(GROWLS)

52:43.440 --> 52:45.351
Acceptance into the Magisterium.

52:45.480 --> 52:47.551
Baptism?

52:49.360 --> 52:50.759
King Iofur...

52:51.920 --> 52:53.638
...you are a great bear...

52:55.000 --> 52:59.073
...and the Magisterium would be stronger
for having you part of it.

52:59.200 --> 53:00.554
Part of us.

53:03.640 --> 53:06.200
Will you walk the path with us?

53:07.320 --> 53:12.235
No bears have ever been brought
into the Magisterium before.

53:13.880 --> 53:17.669
You would be the first bear
to be baptised...

53:17.800 --> 53:20.076
...and the only.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.635
But do not mistake me,

53:22.760 --> 53:25.593
the honour would be ours.

53:25.720 --> 53:30.669
In return for which,
I will give them Asriel?

53:30.800 --> 53:33.440
No, you will keep him here,

53:33.560 --> 53:35.676
but you will ensure
his laboratory is destroyed

53:35.800 --> 53:38.599
and that his research into Dust
is erased.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.677
But 7will control him.

53:42.080 --> 53:43.593
(GROWLS SOFTLY)

53:43.720 --> 53:46.234
I'm simply asking for you
to show your loyalty to us

53:46.360 --> 53:50.035
so that we may show
our loyalty to you.

53:51.120 --> 53:52.952
In the meantime,

53:53.080 --> 53:55.799
I'm sure you have much to attend to.

53:55.920 --> 53:58.673
How soon can this happen?

54:03.960 --> 54:07.078
The wheels have already
started turning.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.271
Asriel will be controlled.
