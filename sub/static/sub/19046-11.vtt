Frank, you seeing this?
I'm working on the chicken
parts over here.

00:10.277 --> 00:13.112
Forget the chicken parts.
Charlie is about to shatter
the world record...

for holding his breath--
He's up to seven minutes.

-Take the buns off the radiator.
-Forget the buns. We are gonna
be world famous after this.

Charlie, how you doing?
I gotta breathe, man.

00:20.287 --> 00:23.255
No, Charlie, don't breathe!
One more minute!

Don't do that!
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

- Of course I'm breathing!

- What do you want, lady?
- [ Charlie ] Ow!

Uh, my name is Betty Canuso,
and I don't know if you heard,

00:40.574 --> 00:45.310
but a week ago, Eastern State
Correctional Facility
was forced to release...

00:45.312 --> 00:47.446
25% of its inmates
due to overcrowding.

00:47.448 --> 00:52.584

my dad is. Maybe they let my dad
out. Did they let my dad out?

How would I know that?
[ Chuckles ]

00:54.355 --> 00:58.857
Listen, I'm here because of
a man named Wendell Albright,
a registered sex offender.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.692
He's moved into this

Yeah.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.562
I'm hoping by raising awareness
we can force him out of
the neighborhood...

01:03.564 --> 01:06.331
and away from our children,

It's going on and on.

He's, like, 40 years old.
Oh, my God. Look at his jaw.
Look at his jawline.

02:11.398 --> 02:14.600
His jaw is exactly where
I don't look like him.
His jaw is fat and it's--

02:14.602 --> 02:19.238
- Go, like, this far back.
- I never go that far back.
When I do, it doesn't do that.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.974
I give you six to eight months
before you start looking
exactly like that guy.

There's no resemblance--

- Dad. They did let you out.
Oh, my God.

Hey, hey, man.
Hey, by the way,

02:39.193 --> 02:42.661
real sorry about that whole
heroin incident in the butt,
but here's the deal.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.998
I had my butt filled
like a Christmas stocking,
and I wanted to come,

everything came flushing
out of me.

Didn't I stab you once?

now that you're out?

- Good thinking.

Oh, yeah.
Dude, Dee, that guy
really likes your hair.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.901
- Yeah, he does.
This is a very bad plan.
- What? Which one?

03:22.903 --> 03:25.404
- This man should not work here.
- Why are you attacking us?

03:25.406 --> 03:30.609
This guy looks like
he wants to eat me. Has he ever
eaten anybody that you know of?

03:30.611 --> 03:31.710
I don't think so.

03:31.712 --> 03:35.380
- No. But it'd be
pretty cool if he did.
- Yeah, that is really cool.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.450
Think about the dedication
you got to put into eating
a human body.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.652

commitment, imagine what--

Do you have plans, Dad?

do some father-son stuff.

Listen, I need
your help, okay?

04:27.968 --> 04:31.503
You're part owner of the bar,
and you're probably the only
person that Mac listens to,

04:31.505 --> 04:35.607
and I need you talk to him--
Dee, you're blowing this
completely out of proportion.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.343
Mac's dad probably hasn't seen
a woman in a very long time.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.078
And as soon as he comes across
one that's actually attractive,

04:40.080 --> 04:45.083
he's gonna forget all about you,
just like every other man does.
Why do you do that?

in the streets, Dee?

to do with that.

more out of my life.

05:13.847 --> 05:14.880
Well, why are you taking
all my shit?

05:14.882 --> 05:19.484
Well, it was really hard to tell
whose was whose, so I just
decided to take everything.

You don't ever use this.
I use that all the time.

I use. All right, slow down,

everything I say.

gonna do very well out there
without this guy.

but, uh, I think you'll find
that I'm a pretty sweet deal...

out there on your own,
and I'll tell you what else.

with my, uh, correspondence.

of a struggle, but, uh,

operation. We want to prove that

you from this fatty than by
showing off this amazing body?

There is an amazing body under
this shirt. I'm gonna pop the
shirt off. I need to show it.

You go over there and put on
a fitness clinic for these kids.

Don't ever take Frank from me
again! He's mine now!
I got him back, so--

20:06.339 --> 20:08.773
- What?
- Officer. Officer,
we know everything.

20:08.775 --> 20:12.543
What are you talking about?
We're the ones that called you.
That's my dad you're arresting.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.612
He's been killing
all the people on this list.
Oh, yeah.

20:14.614 --> 20:18.349
We looked into all
that already. He wasn't
killing those people.

20:18.351 --> 20:21.786
In fact, everybody on that list
spoke very highly of him.

20:21.788 --> 20:22.653
Spoke highly of him?
What?

20:22.655 --> 20:25.756
Yeah. Apparently, he was making
amends with all the people
he wronged.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.826
Then if he hasn't been killing
anybody, why are you
arresting him?

20:28.828 --> 20:29.994
Because he violated
his parole.

20:29.996 --> 20:34.765
He's not supposed to leave
the state and we caught him
buying three airline tickets.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.467
To where?
Cooperstown, New York.

Dad! Dad,
you did want to take me

20:52.385 --> 20:54.785
Well, I wanted it
to be a surprise.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.054
It is a surprise.
It's a huge surprise, Dad.

20:57.056 --> 21:01.392
And I wanted Charlie to know
there were no hard feelings
about that whole,

21:01.394 --> 21:03.427
you know, heroin thing.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.029

I am so sorry for ratting
you out and turning you in.

21:07.367 --> 21:11.636
