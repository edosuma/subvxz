WEBVTT

00:11.084 --> 00:13.234
Geez, look at this stuff.

00:13.503 --> 00:19.021
Golden Sunset Retirement Village.
Investments for Seniors.

00:19.426 --> 00:23.658
Willowbrook Mortuary.
What the hell kind of list am I on?

00:24.014 --> 00:28.371
The good news is I don't think it's the
kind of list they keep you on very long.

00:28.727 --> 00:33.482
Ever since I turned 65, all I get is
geezer mail. It's very depressing.

00:33.857 --> 00:37.691
The only thing depressing about
being a geezer is looking like one.

00:38.028 --> 00:40.747
There's things a person can do
to look younger.

00:41.031 --> 00:44.785
- How he dresses...
- I tried those Jordache jeans.

00:45.118 --> 00:48.508
I just think you ought
to leave something to the imagination.

00:48.830 --> 00:52.140
There's always your hair.
I know it's not exactly your style,

00:52.459 --> 00:55.576
but there's nothing wrong
with covering up that grey.

00:55.879 --> 00:58.837
I know just the right shade for you.
Cinnamon sable.

01:01.051 --> 01:04.282
Cinnamon sable? Sounds nice.

01:05.346 --> 01:07.338
Wait, I couldn't use that.

01:07.599 --> 01:10.557
That's Duke's shade.
He'd scratch my eyes out.

01:12.688 --> 01:15.361
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, prepare to salivate.

01:15.649 --> 01:18.959
If that is a picture
of your new Biedermeier loveseat,

01:19.278 --> 01:21.314
you've already shown it to me.

01:21.572 --> 01:23.688
This is a photo of my latest purchase.

01:23.949 --> 01:28.227
An exquisite 18th century Turkish
prayer rug. Paid a fortune for it,

01:28.579 --> 01:32.333
but legend says whatever you pray for
on this rug will come to you.

01:32.666 --> 01:34.736
It certainly worked for the dealer.

01:37.588 --> 01:40.978
I'm sorry, Niles,
I'm just not in the best of moods.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.939
I had another disastrous
blind date today.

01:44.219 --> 01:45.254
I'm sorry.

01:45.470 --> 01:48.303
Murderers on Death Row
can find women to marry them.

01:49.975 --> 01:53.126
I can't find one
to sit through coffee with me.

01:53.437 --> 01:55.428
It's easy for them to attract women.

01:55.689 --> 01:58.442
They have all that time
to work out in the yard.

01:58.734 --> 02:01.294
I'm serious. I'm getting desperate here.

02:01.570 --> 02:04.289
My love life's
not much better than yours,

02:04.573 --> 02:07.133
but you don't see me
going off the deep end.

02:07.409 --> 02:10.845
Did it ever occur to you that
this recent antique buying binge

02:11.163 --> 02:15.714
is nothing but a way of sublimating
your frustrated sexual desires?

02:16.084 --> 02:18.962
These purchases
have nothing to do with sex.

02:19.254 --> 02:22.132
Don't they? In addition
to the loveseat, let's see,

02:22.424 --> 02:26.417
your most recent acquisitions
have been a French bedwarmer,

02:26.762 --> 02:30.550
a pair of toby jugs,

02:30.891 --> 02:33.883
the less said
about that Civil War ramrod, the better.

02:36.605 --> 02:40.678
You Freudians.
Sometimes a ramrod is just a...

02:41.026 --> 02:43.984
Hell, even I can't make that one fly.

02:44.279 --> 02:46.395
Take heart.
We're both in the same boat.

02:46.657 --> 02:49.649
But where do you go to meet people?

02:49.952 --> 02:53.547
Just yesterday
I met a very nice man at the grocery.

02:53.872 --> 02:56.261
He asked me
if I was free Saturday night.

02:56.542 --> 02:59.102
He said, "Wait,
that's me niece's Bat Mitzvah".

02:59.378 --> 03:03.690
I said I've never been to a Bat Mitzvah.
He asked me to go to the Bat Mitzvah.

03:04.049 --> 03:06.438
I said I'd love to go
to the Bat Mitzvah. So...

03:06.718 --> 03:08.151
- Daphne?
- Yes?

03:08.387 --> 03:11.459
Nothing. I'm sorry. Go on.

03:11.765 --> 03:16.964
I seem to have lost me train of thought.
Anyone like some tea?

03:17.354 --> 03:19.549
- Love some. Thank you.
- Thank you, yes.

03:20.941 --> 03:24.411
Little trick I discovered
a few weeks ago. It's a lifesaver.

03:24.736 --> 03:30.606
Anyway, as I was saying, where
does one go to meet available women?

03:31.618 --> 03:33.848
There are singles bars, of course.

03:34.121 --> 03:37.750
- We could join a health club.
- There's a splendid idea.

03:38.083 --> 03:41.553
I can just picture the two of us,
tank tops and spandex.

03:41.879 --> 03:45.349
With matching headbands,
we might as well sterilise ourselves.

03:45.674 --> 03:50.270
Sounds like fun, Daph.
If she says Bat Mitzvah one more time...

03:51.889 --> 03:53.368
- Hey, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.

03:53.599 --> 03:55.635
You come up with an idea.

03:55.893 --> 03:59.363
- What are you guys talking about?
- Our pathetic love lives.

03:59.688 --> 04:03.920
Why don't you do what my buddies and
I did when we were hard up for dates?

04:04.276 --> 04:06.267
Invade Korea?

04:10.657 --> 04:13.091
No, we'd throw a party
with just one rule.

04:13.368 --> 04:15.836
Only single, available people
were invited.

04:16.120 --> 04:19.317
I don't know, Dad.
That doesn't really sound like us.

04:19.625 --> 04:24.176
It works. I used to throw one a month.
People used to call them Marty parties.

04:24.546 --> 04:28.539
People would call me and say,
"Marty, when's the next Marty party?"

04:28.884 --> 04:33.162
"Isn't it time for another Marty party?"
"Had a great time at the last one".

04:33.513 --> 04:34.832
- Dad?
- Yeah?

04:35.057 --> 04:38.208
I'm sorry. Nothing.

04:38.518 --> 04:41.954
Or somebody might say,
"Can I host the next Marty party?"

04:42.272 --> 04:44.263
Doesn't always work.

04:44.524 --> 04:47.402
I don't think
we're quite hard up enough yet

04:47.694 --> 04:51.050
- to stage a singles party.
- OK, suit yourself.

04:51.365 --> 04:55.358
We'll just get ready for the evening.
I'll dish out the spaghetti

04:55.702 --> 05:00.492
and you guys set up the card table.
I got us a new jigsaw puzzle.

05:00.874 --> 05:02.865
10,000 pieces.

05:03.961 --> 05:06.919
It's called "The Wheat Field".

05:13.053 --> 05:15.965
- I'll send the invitations.
- I'll call the caterer.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:27.776 --> 05:30.085
Hello, welcome. Please come in.

05:30.362 --> 05:33.593
This is wonderful.
I had no idea we'd get such a turnout.

05:33.907 --> 05:37.820
Everywhere I look there's another woman
I want to get to know better.

05:38.161 --> 05:40.629
With some obvious exceptions.

05:40.914 --> 05:43.951
- Roz, I didn't know you were coming.
- I know it's a long shot

05:44.251 --> 05:48.164
but I figured I better get out and
do a little flirting or I'd forget how.

05:49.131 --> 05:52.328
- Can I offer you something?
- Yeah...

05:57.014 --> 05:59.244
Roz, you are rusty.

06:00.726 --> 06:03.001
I know you've been striking out lately,

06:03.270 --> 06:06.421
but I invited someone
who'll improve your batting average.

06:06.732 --> 06:08.768
I've already met someone captivating.

06:09.026 --> 06:10.744
- Hi, Roz.
- Tina, you made it.

06:10.986 --> 06:14.535
You know me.
Have I ever said no to a good time?

06:14.865 --> 06:17.140
That's what I was trying
to tell Frasier.

06:18.243 --> 06:20.757
Tina Kramer, meet Dr Frasier Crane.

06:21.038 --> 06:24.314
- Doctor, huh?
- Yes, that's right. Roz?

06:24.625 --> 06:26.695
Strong hands.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.919
I guess it's true what they say,
strong hands, strong mind.

06:31.256 --> 06:35.135
That's why you'll never see an
unopened pickle jar at a Mensa meeting.

06:38.805 --> 06:40.318
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

06:41.475 --> 06:43.193
Oh, excuse me.

06:45.854 --> 06:46.843
Martin?

06:49.566 --> 06:52.797
- You're looking at my hair, right?
- Yeah. Looks great.

06:53.111 --> 06:55.102
Thanks. Yeah, I did it myself.

06:55.364 --> 06:57.958
- Get out.
- Yeah, really.

06:58.242 --> 07:01.200
Well, Daphne suggested it.
And at first I said no way,

07:01.495 --> 07:03.884
but then I thought
a lot of other guys do it.

07:04.164 --> 07:07.679
What better place to try it
than here where nobody knows who I am.

07:08.001 --> 07:09.480
You look great, too.

07:09.711 --> 07:13.181
I was really happy with this dress.
You can't tell I'm pregnant.

07:13.507 --> 07:16.021
I know. Real nice.

07:17.427 --> 07:21.784
You have a good time at the party and
the dress looks great. Nobody'd know.

07:22.140 --> 07:24.734
Same with your hair.
It's completely natural.

07:32.568 --> 07:34.604
- Hey, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.

07:34.861 --> 07:38.058
Watch that "Dad" business.
Got a few ladies around here

07:38.365 --> 07:40.799
thinking I just might be your brother.

07:41.076 --> 07:43.954
Yeah, it's like looking in a mirror.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.521
- Aren't you having fun?
- Sort of.

07:46.790 --> 07:51.022
It's been so long since I've been single
it's hard to strike up conversations.

07:51.378 --> 07:56.088
You just need a little confidence.
Watch this.

07:56.466 --> 07:58.218
- Hi there.
- Hi.

07:58.468 --> 08:03.462
I'm Marty Crane. And this is my son,
Niles. Yep, my son.

08:05.225 --> 08:07.944
Hi, Vicky Cantrell. You're the host.

08:08.228 --> 08:10.788
I was admiring
your beautiful Turkish rug.

08:11.064 --> 08:13.897
- Thank you.
- Is that 18th century?

08:14.192 --> 08:16.342
Yes, it is. You have quite an eye.

08:16.612 --> 08:20.287
I work for an auction house. I'd
love to see some of your other pieces.

08:20.616 --> 08:24.734
It would be my pleasure. There's
an absurd old legend about that rug,

08:25.078 --> 08:27.353
that whatever you pray for...

08:27.623 --> 08:30.183
Well, perhaps
it's not that absurd after all.

08:31.501 --> 08:33.890
Roz, that woman is all over me.

08:34.171 --> 08:36.731
Didn't you get
what I was trying to tell you?

08:37.006 --> 08:39.965
Yes. I also got it when she showed me
how she can tie a knot

08:40.260 --> 08:43.172
- in a cherry stem with her tongue.
- That's a party trick.

08:43.472 --> 08:46.066
The cherry was in my mouth at the time.

08:47.851 --> 08:50.160
I tried to tell you
that I met a woman tonight.

08:50.437 --> 08:52.826
- All right, I'll go talk to her.
- Thank you.

08:53.941 --> 08:55.294
- Frasier.
- Niles.

08:55.525 --> 08:58.164
I just met the most fabulous woman.

08:58.445 --> 09:01.676
That's fabulous.
I also met someone who's terrific.

09:01.990 --> 09:04.743
Wait, I can't wait.
I have to show you mine first.

09:05.035 --> 09:07.708
- She's over by the buffet.
- So is mine.

09:09.164 --> 09:11.553
At what point
would you like to acknowledge

09:11.833 --> 09:14.142
that we're both waving
at the same woman?

09:15.837 --> 09:17.236
I saw her first.

09:17.464 --> 09:20.058
You're the host. You see everyone first.

09:20.342 --> 09:24.176
- There are plenty of other women here.
- Exactly. So go pick one.

09:24.513 --> 09:29.223
Let's stop this. The civilised thing to
do is for us to both stay away from her.

09:29.601 --> 09:33.514
We are psychiatrists, not a couple
of rutting pigs in a barnyard.

09:33.855 --> 09:36.050
What do you say to that?

09:37.067 --> 09:38.659
Sooey.

09:41.446 --> 09:43.835
- Very well. May the better man win.
- Fine.

09:44.116 --> 09:47.108
- Frasier, your father wants you.
- Advantage Niles.

09:50.539 --> 09:54.532
I want you to meet a big fan of yours.
Kathy Locker, Dr Frasier Crane.

09:54.877 --> 09:59.951
I love your show.
You're such a good listener.

10:00.591 --> 10:04.266
Just yesterday you gave the best advice
to that woman who called in

10:04.595 --> 10:07.951
about a problem with her teenage son.
What was it you said?

10:08.265 --> 10:12.702
What do I ever say? You're in denial.
Seek help. Whatever. Blah, blah, blah.

10:14.813 --> 10:18.806
- He's different from what I expected.
- He's not what I expected either,

10:19.151 --> 10:21.028
but you get used to it.

10:21.278 --> 10:25.191
You were telling me
about being a detective.

10:25.532 --> 10:28.285
Do you feel like getting a drink?

10:28.577 --> 10:31.489
- That would be nice, Marty.
- OK.

10:38.921 --> 10:41.640
You know,
this is such a prime spot here.

10:41.924 --> 10:45.280
maybe one of us should stay here
and the other one get the drinks.

10:45.594 --> 10:46.947
You're right.

10:47.179 --> 10:49.170
So I'll have a beer.

10:51.308 --> 10:52.866
OK.

10:54.144 --> 10:56.419
I think I lost an earring.

10:56.688 --> 10:58.679
There it is, by my foot.

11:03.278 --> 11:05.428
There you go.

11:07.491 --> 11:09.561
Thanks. Enjoy the party.

11:14.248 --> 11:17.445
- These egg rolls are delicious.
- I made them myself.

11:17.751 --> 11:21.107
Really? A psychiatrist and a chef.
Impressive.

11:21.421 --> 11:23.810
They both came in handy
when I cured the ham.

11:26.093 --> 11:29.403
Hello, Niles.
There's an emergency in the kitchen.

11:29.721 --> 11:33.919
Very cagey, Frasier. Why don't
you just run out and yell "fire"?

11:34.268 --> 11:36.907
- Excuse me, Vicky, for a moment.
- Of course.

11:39.523 --> 11:42.879
- Is it a serious problem?
- No, he's always run like that.

11:48.031 --> 11:50.340
You mean the kitchen.
He can handle it.

11:50.617 --> 11:54.246
- You two seem very close.
- Yes. I'm his best friend.

11:54.580 --> 11:57.458
Well, his only friend, really.

11:58.208 --> 12:00.642
That surprises me.
He seems very outgoing.

12:00.919 --> 12:05.276
Doesn't he, though? Yes, the medication
seems to be working wonders.

12:05.632 --> 12:08.783
I just hope he sticks with it this time.

12:09.094 --> 12:11.369
Shall we hit the buffet?

12:12.723 --> 12:16.033
- What a great story.
- Thanks. This is fun.

12:16.351 --> 12:18.581
I usually hate these kinds of parties.

12:18.854 --> 12:21.243
Me, too.
People are always so superficial.

12:21.523 --> 12:25.562
Yeah, it seems like everybody nowadays
is all about appearances.

12:25.903 --> 12:28.417
- Shall we get a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

12:32.576 --> 12:35.010
- I'm not really very thirsty.
- Me, either.

12:37.539 --> 12:40.736
Then I top it off with brandied cherries
and crème fraîche.

12:41.043 --> 12:42.032
Frasier.

12:42.252 --> 12:44.971
I'm telling Vicky
my recipe for crépe gâteau.

12:45.255 --> 12:48.372
I'm sure she's had enough
of your crépe by now.

12:49.301 --> 12:52.452
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Dad needs you, Frasier.

12:52.763 --> 12:54.754
- No, he doesn't.
- I think he might.

12:56.141 --> 12:58.860
All right, then. If you will excuse me.

12:59.686 --> 13:01.677
Do you live with your father?

13:01.939 --> 13:06.091
No. A grown man live with his father?
Frasier lives with Dad.

13:07.069 --> 13:08.422
Champagne?

13:08.654 --> 13:11.726
Get me home.
Something's happening with my hair dye.

13:12.032 --> 13:15.069
It's melting. Look at this stain.
It must look terrible.

13:15.369 --> 13:21.160
No, it looks terrific. Maybe the fire
is making you perspire a bit. Here.

13:25.879 --> 13:30.748
You look quite young and attractive.
Yes, by the warmth of the fire glow,

13:31.134 --> 13:35.730
I'd say that you actually look like
you're back in your "Marty party" days.

13:36.098 --> 13:39.727
You're not BS-ing me?
OK, then, I'll stay.

13:41.603 --> 13:44.834
- Vicky, hello. Where's Niles?
- He had to take a call.

13:46.358 --> 13:47.757
That's terrific.

13:48.652 --> 13:52.770
Would you like to find someplace
where we could talk? No interruptions.

13:53.115 --> 13:55.106
- Frasier...
- Not now, Roz.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.564
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- My water just broke.

14:00.247 --> 14:03.000
Maybe you sat in something.

14:03.292 --> 14:06.011
Oh, my God!
What's all over my Turkish prayer rug?

14:07.671 --> 14:10.583
- You've got to get me to a hospital.
- Yes, of course.

14:10.883 --> 14:14.353
Vicky, if you'll excuse us,
my friend Roz just went into labour.

14:14.678 --> 14:16.714
- How exciting! Good luck.
- Thanks.

14:16.972 --> 14:20.408
Wait one second.
This may not be an appropriate moment

14:20.726 --> 14:23.638
but perhaps you'd like
to have dinner with me sometime?

14:23.937 --> 14:27.134
That's sweet of you,
but I'm not really interested.

14:27.441 --> 14:29.796
Thank you for your honesty.

14:30.068 --> 14:34.186
What is wrong with me? Why can't I find
a woman who's interested in me?

14:34.531 --> 14:38.888
Those are two different questions
so we should talk them both over.

14:39.244 --> 14:41.997
Wait, I can't. Because I'm in labour!

14:49.713 --> 14:50.907
How did we do?

14:51.131 --> 14:53.247
This time it's hot and it's got cream.

14:53.508 --> 14:55.624
Of course, it's still chicken soup.

14:56.845 --> 14:59.757
Who needs coffee when we can keep alert

15:00.057 --> 15:03.333
by perusing these
very up-to-date magazines?

15:03.644 --> 15:07.353
Look, Dad. That cute Tricia Nixon's
getting married.

15:09.775 --> 15:13.563
Excuse me, may we get an update
on Roz Doyle?

15:13.904 --> 15:17.101
Sure. She is still in early labour.
Hang in there.

15:18.158 --> 15:20.592
She's pretty.
I should make a play for her.

15:20.869 --> 15:24.464
Considering how young and attractive
I am tonight.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.020
I said I was sorry.

15:27.918 --> 15:30.671
Not half as sorry as
when I ran over that speed bump

15:30.963 --> 15:33.636
and you left a headprint
on the ceiling of my BMW.

15:35.050 --> 15:36.244
Hello.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.663
Niles, didn't expect to see you here.

15:38.929 --> 15:42.683
The doorman found Roz's purse in
the lobby. I thought she might need it.

15:43.016 --> 15:46.372
I suppose you also came to gloat.
You got Vicky, I didn't.

15:46.687 --> 15:49.884
Neither of us got Vicky.
She went home with the bartender.

15:51.149 --> 15:52.343
Really?

15:52.568 --> 15:56.607
Well, you know what I say? Her loss.

15:56.947 --> 16:00.303
Absolutely right. Her loss.

16:00.617 --> 16:04.371
Has saying that
ever made you feel any better?

16:04.705 --> 16:06.138
Not a whit.

16:06.373 --> 16:08.489
It's been a hell of a night
for all of us.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.867
It certainly was for me.
I lost Vicky, my rug is ruined,

16:12.170 --> 16:14.889
someone left weird brown stains
on my wing chair.

16:19.595 --> 16:20.584
Hello.

16:21.430 --> 16:26.026
I came down as soon as I heard.
What the hell happened to your hair?

16:26.393 --> 16:28.987
I coloured it just like you told me to.

16:29.271 --> 16:31.262
This isn't cinnamon sable.

16:31.523 --> 16:34.356
I couldn't use that.
It had a woman's picture on the box.

16:34.651 --> 16:39.600
I used some stuff called Color In A Can.
It said just spray on and go.

16:39.990 --> 16:43.949
- How did I know it was a lousy product?
- If only there had been some clue.

16:46.288 --> 16:49.485
Don't you start on me.
You had me melting by that fire.

16:49.791 --> 16:53.306
Wait a minute. You're the one
who left stains on my wing chair.

16:54.296 --> 16:57.129
I was wondering when you'd crack that,
Miss Marple.

16:57.424 --> 16:59.858
Don't start with me.

17:00.135 --> 17:05.255
Stop it! What is wrong with you?
Our friend is having a baby in there.

17:05.641 --> 17:10.078
We've all had dreadful evenings
but we should be thinking about Roz.

17:10.436 --> 17:11.551
Exactly.

17:12.814 --> 17:16.647
Besides, nobody could have had
as horrendous an evening as I did.

17:16.984 --> 17:20.864
I got stood up at a Bat Mitzvah.
I waited there an hour.

17:21.198 --> 17:23.665
He left a lame excuse on the machine,

17:23.951 --> 17:28.069
but if he thinks he's got another chance
with me, he's <i>meshuggah.</i>

17:33.919 --> 17:37.594
Oh, boo hoo, anyway.
At least you had a date tonight.

17:37.923 --> 17:40.801
And at least your apartment
wasn't decimated.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.324
I went to a party tonight
with shoe polish on my hair.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.042
That's it. Breathe. You're doing great.

17:51.311 --> 17:52.744
Take care, honey.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.254
Good luck.

17:54.481 --> 17:55.834
We love you.

18:02.781 --> 18:05.978
She's very tired, so
I'll have to ask you to make it quick.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.553
Roz, congratulations.

18:10.747 --> 18:12.339
Look at her.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.460
She is beautiful.

18:14.710 --> 18:16.109
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

18:18.422 --> 18:19.980
It's a long story.

18:20.215 --> 18:21.807
So, what's her name?

18:22.050 --> 18:24.689
Alice. Alice May Doyle.

18:25.721 --> 18:29.999
My daughter. My God,
that's the first time I ever said that.

18:30.350 --> 18:33.422
You look great. How do you feel?

18:33.729 --> 18:36.323
Fine. I'm just a little tired.

18:36.607 --> 18:39.599
Maybe we should go.
I'll drop by and see you tomorrow.

18:39.902 --> 18:43.497
I sure would love to hold her
for just a second.

18:43.822 --> 18:47.132
Maybe we should just wait
until you're not dripping toxins.

18:50.329 --> 18:53.127
We'll see you, then. OK. Bye.

18:53.415 --> 18:56.407
- Congratulations.
- I'll be along in a second.

18:58.378 --> 19:00.573
Roz, congratulations again.

19:01.298 --> 19:05.610
I'm so proud of you.
Your little girl is just perfect.

19:05.969 --> 19:07.960
She is, isn't she?

19:10.933 --> 19:15.290
- My God, look at your face.
- I must look real lovely.

19:15.646 --> 19:18.683
Yes, that's exactly how you look.
Lovely.

19:18.982 --> 19:24.579
I don't think I've ever seen a face
more purely happy than right now.

19:26.657 --> 19:28.329
Little Alice,

19:28.575 --> 19:32.090
how I wish you could wake up right now

19:32.412 --> 19:34.767
and see how beautiful your mother looks.

19:39.169 --> 19:41.558
Then again, you need your rest.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.078
You did great, honey.

19:52.224 --> 19:53.657
Sleep well.

19:55.727 --> 19:57.126
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

19:58.981 --> 20:03.497
This may be an odd time to ask you this
but I was convinced

20:03.861 --> 20:07.331
that we sort of made
some eye contact in the waiting room.

20:07.656 --> 20:10.250
I was wondering if I could
get your number?

20:10.534 --> 20:14.163
- But what about your...?
- Forget about her. She's asleep.

20:14.496 --> 20:17.056
What kind of monster are you?

20:22.170 --> 20:24.161
Her loss.
