WEBVTT

02:21.558 --> 02:22.558
Hey!

02:40.327 --> 02:46.539
A girl at my door

02:50.712 --> 02:52.828
most of the income here

02:53.465 --> 03:01.338
either comes from catching octopus,
or from farming oysters and fish.

03:01.348 --> 03:07.469
Mendnets, or mend the
tools needed for fishing,

03:07.813 --> 03:09.474
that sort of thing.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.600
Uh, who do we have here?

03:15.737 --> 03:19.855
I told that woman not to ride
her bike on the main road!

03:21.618 --> 03:25.952
Mrs. jum-soon,
I told you not to ride that thing!

03:27.124 --> 03:30.457
Or at least ride it sober.
Why don't you listen?

03:30.460 --> 03:33.247
Buy me a bottle of rice wine
if you're gonna lecture me!

03:33.505 --> 03:34.620
Dammit!

03:34.631 --> 03:35.631
Who's this?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.503
Is that your new bride?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.875
Lucky you!

03:41.263 --> 03:43.879
Have fun tonight!

03:44.349 --> 03:45.885
Don't ride that thing,
it's dangerous!

03:46.017 --> 03:47.017
See ya!

04:10.792 --> 04:14.410
Damn, that was fast.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.254
He told me he was gonna pick
them up.

04:20.969 --> 04:21.969
Hey!

04:22.637 --> 04:23.626
Why so loud?

04:23.638 --> 04:24.593
You coming later?

04:24.598 --> 04:25.598
We'll see.

04:26.475 --> 04:30.764
Hey, tell your mother
to stop riding that thing!

04:30.771 --> 04:34.263
You kidding me? I'm surprised
she doesn't sleep with it.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.265
God, she's stubborn.

04:38.028 --> 04:42.397
Oh, this is our new station chief.
Say hello.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.866
She's a pretty one.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.026
Sexy girl, you know?

04:48.038 --> 04:52.532
Huh? Bastard, watch your mouth.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.542
Bye!

05:00.383 --> 05:02.499
Those guys in the car

05:03.053 --> 05:07.422
they're mostly southeast Asian
or Korean-Chinese.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.016
They're the only ones
who'll work here.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.431
It's a big problem.

05:15.065 --> 05:19.024
The only people left in this village
are senior citizens.

05:20.445 --> 05:26.566
Park yong-ha. He's the only
one in town... young man.

05:31.206 --> 05:36.200
I set out the basics for you. If you
need anything else, let me know.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.326
I'll be fine.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.703
Sorry to trouble you on
such short notice.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.170
It's no trouble!

05:41.174 --> 05:43.790
You'd be done faster if we helped.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.043
It's okay. That's everything there.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.587
They sell bottled water here, too.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.548
I'll take that.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.717
It's a bit heavy.

05:56.815 --> 06:00.728
Don't look down on us
'cause you're from Seoul.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.976
We have everything here!

06:02.988 --> 06:05.229
Except for what we don't have...

06:05.240 --> 06:06.696
Listen to you.

08:56.453 --> 09:00.787
I'm getting tired of this,
you little bitch.

09:00.790 --> 09:06.080
You act like a fucking whore.
Don't you avoid me!

09:06.087 --> 09:07.087
Hey!

09:07.589 --> 09:08.669
What are you doing there?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.086
What the fuck?

09:13.845 --> 09:16.461
This brat was supposed to give me
something, but she won't.

09:17.849 --> 09:21.683
What is it you want so badly that
you all have to gang up on her?

09:22.812 --> 09:23.847
What school do you go to?

09:23.855 --> 09:26.722
One more time, and
I'll bash your head in with this.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.349
What school?

09:30.987 --> 09:33.103
It's the middle school
down the road, right?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.229
Fuck!

09:51.841 --> 09:53.456
You go to the same
school as them?

09:57.639 --> 09:58.970
Why'd they do this to you?

10:02.852 --> 10:03.852
What's your name?

10:09.025 --> 10:12.392
It's dohee. Sun dohee.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.397
Now I know your name,
I can find them too.

10:17.909 --> 10:21.902
If they bother you again, tell them the
police will come and get them, okay?

10:35.426 --> 10:37.508
Don't be half-assed, do it in red.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.672
Here they are.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.545
They sure are.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.131
The beauty salon's going to
make some cash today.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.679
That's right!

10:44.686 --> 10:47.143
Shave their heads
nice and smooth.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.182
Hello.

10:49.691 --> 10:53.058
What do they eat that makes
them so black?

10:53.069 --> 10:56.027
Girls, hurry up
and get ready for tonight!

10:56.030 --> 10:59.693
Our chief is coming, so we
need time to prepare properly.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.526
Right, chief?

11:03.329 --> 11:04.944
Look at her laugh.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.577
I hope he doesn't get drunk
off his ass tonight.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.705
Hey, it's chief's turn now!

11:12.714 --> 11:14.830
The verse is about to start.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.335
Maybe chief wants to do
a different song.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.049
Hurry and come up here!

11:24.601 --> 11:26.592
This song's already started.

11:28.104 --> 11:34.475
She's an absolute killer

11:35.195 --> 11:40.610
I'm so attractive
and loved by many

11:42.076 --> 11:47.992
but I picked her out of the crowd

11:49.000 --> 11:54.996
you're so beautiful

11:56.007 --> 12:01.127
you're so sexy

13:21.968 --> 13:26.428
You can't throw away
bottles here.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.966
I'll clean them all up.

13:53.875 --> 13:59.245
Come over here, you little bitch!

14:55.561 --> 14:56.892
What the fuck?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.306
Are you okay?

14:58.314 --> 15:01.181
Who the fuck are you?

15:12.203 --> 15:15.161
Get away from my son!
Don't hurt him!

15:15.415 --> 15:18.452
Who the hell are you?

15:18.459 --> 15:19.949
- Leave my boy alone.
- Hey!

15:19.961 --> 15:21.076
Leave my son alone

15:21.087 --> 15:23.287
- come here and get my cell phone.
- Leave my son alone!

15:23.840 --> 15:24.670
It's in my pants pocket.

15:24.674 --> 15:31.842
Leave him alone.
You're killing him!

15:31.848 --> 15:32.963
Press 1 and hold it.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.215
You're hurting my boy.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.226
Hold it up to my ear.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.061
This is Lee young-nam.
Send a patrol car.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.813
I'm at park yong-ha's house.

15:49.365 --> 15:53.233
Hey. Wake up already.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.619
Hey!

15:56.497 --> 15:57.612
Get up.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.615
You think this is your home?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.450
Shit!

16:03.129 --> 16:04.835
What's with you?

16:05.256 --> 16:06.996
This isn't your living room.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.504
- Shit.
- Don't act like...

16:13.139 --> 16:14.504
I can't believe this.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.346
Why'd you get so drunk?

16:17.018 --> 16:19.509
You're lucky that
chief went easy on you,

16:19.520 --> 16:22.387
otherwise you'd have gone
straight to prison.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.392
Why did you beat your child?

16:29.780 --> 16:30.780
Who did?

16:32.408 --> 16:33.408
When?

16:33.659 --> 16:35.399
Don't beat your kid.

16:35.786 --> 16:39.779
Child abuse by parents is a crime. Last
night, you were caught in the act.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.874
What the fuck.

16:43.878 --> 16:48.622
I can't discipline my
own daughter?

16:48.883 --> 16:52.546
How dare you speak
to the chief that way?

16:56.766 --> 16:59.007
Go, you've been warned.

17:04.065 --> 17:07.272
- Hey.
- Get out of here.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.356
Leave.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.775
Get out.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.903
Give me a ride. You brought
me here, so take me back.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.040
Take me back.

17:24.794 --> 17:25.909
Take him.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.795
That girl isn't
yong-ha's real daughter.

17:39.267 --> 17:43.681
But he's been raising her
and sending her to school.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.555
He drinks every so often
and gets a bit deranged.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.275
But he takes care of
everything around town.

17:51.779 --> 17:55.943
This town would not run
properly without him.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.159
So we should allow him
to abuse his child?

18:01.831 --> 18:04.664
That's not what I'm saying.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.575
Alcohol is the problem.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.609
Sun dohee!

18:44.081 --> 18:45.081
Come over here.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.583
How often does your father
hit you like that?

19:10.024 --> 19:12.265
Are you mute?
Why don't you talk?

19:16.906 --> 19:18.988
You can't let him beat you
that way.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.276
He doesn't hit me
when he doesn't drink.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.286
- Dohee.
- Yes?

19:35.383 --> 19:39.752
When an adult hits a child,
it's a very bad thing.

19:41.055 --> 19:47.142
If someone beats you that hard,
you need to tell someone, okay?

19:59.281 --> 20:00.281
Miss...

20:01.951 --> 20:04.192
Is it okay if I try the hat on?

20:16.966 --> 20:17.966
Salute!

20:19.051 --> 20:21.963
If you're gonna do it,
do it right. Like this.

20:33.607 --> 20:37.475
You fucking little bitch! How
dare you stand there blabbering?

20:37.486 --> 20:39.317
Come here, you filthy mutt.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.612
Damn bitch.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.361
Stop right there!

20:57.214 --> 21:02.959
You no good fucking bitch,
got no respect.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.006
Stop babbling, you fucker!

21:05.014 --> 21:07.630
Bitch!

21:08.726 --> 21:10.262
You dirty little bitch.

21:45.930 --> 21:49.297
Did you know the alumni association
was called because of you?

21:51.185 --> 21:55.554
Investigations have been started,
a lot of people are in hot water.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.521
I'm sorry.

21:59.068 --> 22:02.902
This won't end just because
you say sorry and get relocated.

22:04.949 --> 22:09.192
Anyway, watch yourself
in shallower waters.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.912
It's easier to be scrutinized
in a small town.

22:13.207 --> 22:16.040
Word travels fast, got it?

22:16.043 --> 22:20.036
Happens again, no one can look after you.
Be careful.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.586
Get your act together.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.006
Inspector Lee young-nam is here.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.560
Lee young-nam, sir.

22:40.568 --> 22:41.568
Sit down.

22:52.997 --> 22:55.238
With your help,
I was safely reassigned.

22:55.249 --> 22:58.741
Sure. It's been 10 days?

22:58.752 --> 23:00.458
Yes, sir.

23:09.138 --> 23:14.633
I don't have any bias in that area.

23:14.643 --> 23:18.386
I don't want to make a fuss over
someone's personal affair.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.015
But we are part of a community.

23:23.652 --> 23:27.236
We shouldn't do things
that we know will cause trouble.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.882
We have the school's
reputation to uphold.

23:35.164 --> 23:39.407
If you lay low for about a year,
you should be able to return.

23:44.298 --> 23:45.788
Thank you.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.509
All right.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.004
Take good care of yourself.
Thank you.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.007
Chief Lee, come here
and have a drink with us!

25:19.018 --> 25:22.886
Come on, we're roasting fish here!

25:23.022 --> 25:26.014
It's windy today. Come and play!

25:26.734 --> 25:30.397
Dohee, come here!

25:30.654 --> 25:32.235
Hey!

25:32.239 --> 25:40.239
What're you doing out
in the middle of the night?

25:40.914 --> 25:44.031
Hey, when your father
talks to you...

25:44.418 --> 25:45.749
That little shit.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.252
Huh? Isn't that the chief?

25:50.299 --> 25:55.669
She's been following
the chief around lately.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.920
She's clingy, like her mother.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.787
Why do you keep following me?

26:31.965 --> 26:33.330
You got something to say?

26:38.222 --> 26:39.428
Then what's wrong?

26:46.605 --> 26:47.605
Get on.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.981
Hold on tight,
I'm going to go really fast.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.629
What were you doing there
this morning?

27:27.104 --> 27:29.641
I thought you were gonna
drown yourself in the sea.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.768
I was practicing dance.

28:23.202 --> 28:27.946
Go home. Don't roam around
at night. It's dangerous.

28:32.461 --> 28:33.701
What's wrong?

28:42.721 --> 28:46.805
Can I go with you?

28:59.112 --> 29:00.352
Get inside.

29:13.210 --> 29:16.998
You fucking bitch.
Where the fuck were you?

29:17.005 --> 29:23.592
Stupid mutt. Acting like
a mutt, just like her mom.

29:38.151 --> 29:41.018
Eun-jung

30:27.200 --> 30:28.565
What happened?

30:44.718 --> 30:45.718
Yes?

30:47.095 --> 30:48.175
What?

30:50.682 --> 30:53.845
The body of an old woman?
A motorcycle?

30:56.355 --> 30:57.720
I'll be right there.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.982
I was called to the scene
at 04:40 hours.

31:06.365 --> 31:10.358
I'll need a crime scene investigator.
Please alert the fire department.

31:11.745 --> 31:12.985
It's a death.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.079
It looks like an accidental death.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.742
First, find park yong-ha.

31:21.755 --> 31:22.755
Yes, ma'am.

31:35.018 --> 31:37.475
Do you know what happened?

31:38.647 --> 31:40.888
What did you see?

31:41.608 --> 31:45.897
Dad chased me.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.521
Dad beat me so I ran away.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.398
And grandma chased me.

31:52.244 --> 31:55.611
Then she fell into the sea.

31:56.665 --> 31:59.372
I ran away to avoid
getting beat up.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.252
You saw her fall in the sea?

32:04.297 --> 32:07.255
Dad beat me.

32:08.051 --> 32:11.293
So I ran, and grandma chased me.

32:12.639 --> 32:13.924
Said she'll kill me.

32:18.812 --> 32:22.430
Were you here with your grandma?

32:25.318 --> 32:26.774
Did you...

32:28.530 --> 32:29.940
Did you do something?

32:35.787 --> 32:41.953
Dad beat me.
I ran so not to get hit.

32:43.712 --> 32:46.044
You told me not to
let him beat me.

32:46.840 --> 32:54.840
But when grandma got on the bike
to get me, she fell in the sea.

32:57.601 --> 33:04.973
I was so scared of the sea.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.978
Okay. It's all right.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.232
It's yong-ha.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.122
What took you so long?

33:26.630 --> 33:28.746
Mom.

33:30.383 --> 33:37.004
Mom.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.630
Dammit.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.510
You fucking bitch!

33:45.232 --> 33:48.895
That bitch attacked me yesterday.
She had wild eyes!

33:48.902 --> 33:51.268
I heard you left home,
and your mother too.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.272
The girl came to my house
after her father beat her.

33:56.618 --> 34:00.531
Why blame the girl
when you were out drinking?

34:00.539 --> 34:03.656
I saw her acting up before I left!

34:03.667 --> 34:08.036
She ran to the chief scared for
her life, after you beat her.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.911
You're not making sense!

34:10.590 --> 34:13.831
From what I see,
alcohol is the problem.

34:15.303 --> 34:19.342
What shall we do?
Take her to the morgue?

34:19.349 --> 34:22.716
We don't know how she died.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.934
We need... what you call it!

34:24.938 --> 34:27.554
Autopsy. We need an autopsy.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.353
Do you even know what
an autopsy is?

34:30.360 --> 34:33.978
They cut her open,
and take out all of her organs.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.605
Do it!

34:36.616 --> 34:38.231
Damn.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.234
Everyone, clear out now.

34:41.246 --> 34:46.081
- Mom!
- Everyone go home.

34:46.585 --> 34:52.376
She was heavily intoxicated with a
blood alcohol content of 0.2%.

34:52.382 --> 34:57.126
And she was in the early stages
of Alzheimer's disease.

34:58.471 --> 35:02.885
We believe she shouldn't
have been operating a vehicle.

35:03.893 --> 35:09.980
We find the cause of death
to be drowning

35:09.983 --> 35:12.895
as a result of careless driving.

35:22.287 --> 35:25.495
Sign here with your thumbprint.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.666
Does the girl need to sign too?

35:41.181 --> 35:44.673
Come over here, sweetie.

35:48.438 --> 35:49.518
Wipe your thumb.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.399
You sign here too.

35:59.824 --> 36:00.904
Go sit over there.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.480
What do you want to do
with the bike?

36:09.584 --> 36:10.664
I'll take it.

36:11.461 --> 36:14.077
It's useless now
that it fell in the sea.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.454
Don't touch it!

37:03.596 --> 37:05.712
This isn't working.
Come with me.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.370
That son of a bitch.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.042
Can we...

37:35.420 --> 37:37.536
Just stay here?

37:46.514 --> 37:49.551
Okay, first take a hot shower.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.069
When is your mom coming?

38:12.081 --> 38:13.821
Why did she leave you here?

38:15.335 --> 38:17.326
She won't come back this time.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.084
I knew it the day she left.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.959
I saw her leave with her luggage
in the middle of the night.

38:27.722 --> 38:32.967
I made eye contact with her, but
she told me to go back to sleep.

38:34.562 --> 38:40.228
Until then, she'd tell me to get
dressed when I asked to come along.

38:49.744 --> 38:55.114
Do you think you get beaten
because of your mother?

38:57.377 --> 38:59.493
My own mother abandoned me.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.126
Do you want to stay here
for a while?

39:09.264 --> 39:12.631
Really?
Can I really stay with you?

39:13.017 --> 39:15.599
Get some sleep for now.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.020
What about you?

39:27.657 --> 39:29.488
I'll sleep in the living room.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.365
Why?

39:32.370 --> 39:34.031
I like sleeping alone.

39:35.415 --> 39:36.530
Okay.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.451
What're you doing?

40:23.463 --> 40:26.045
Chief, I'm hungry.

40:26.299 --> 40:27.584
Okay.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.263
I want to wear this too.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.855
Even the smallest size would be
too big for you.

41:27.110 --> 41:30.102
- This one's pretty too.
- I don't like it.

41:48.506 --> 41:49.916
This is awesome.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.425
Take out your cell phone.

42:04.439 --> 42:06.145
Hold down number 1.

42:11.404 --> 42:13.315
Number 2 is the police station.

42:13.322 --> 42:15.313
If I don't pick up,
call the station.

42:16.284 --> 42:21.699
If your dad tries to hit you again,
run and call me, okay?

42:27.420 --> 42:28.785
Okay.

42:38.598 --> 42:39.963
Look!

43:03.498 --> 43:04.738
Good job.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.707
Now come and eat.

43:13.508 --> 43:16.124
Where did you learn
to sing and dance?

43:16.135 --> 43:19.753
I just picked it up while watching TV.
I'm great at imitating.

43:20.348 --> 43:22.009
What else can you do?

43:23.893 --> 43:27.135
Once upon a time,

43:27.146 --> 43:30.013
there lived a little mermaid.

43:30.274 --> 43:36.520
Under water, she had fins for
legs and a pretty torso.

43:37.031 --> 43:39.022
Her body truly had a twist ending.

43:39.784 --> 43:43.652
The fast dolphin is sleek.

43:46.874 --> 43:49.160
I'll rip you to pieces!

43:49.293 --> 43:54.253
Nice. You sound exactly the same
let's eat.

43:59.428 --> 44:01.510
How's the food?

44:23.202 --> 44:24.658
Excuse me.

44:24.704 --> 44:30.449
A day has passed, and my kid
doesn't even think of coming home.

44:30.459 --> 44:35.579
The people in town said
she'd be here.

44:35.590 --> 44:39.048
I know it's late, but I had to come.

44:39.051 --> 44:42.339
Hi baby, you were here?

44:43.055 --> 44:46.547
Can't you even say
hello to your father, bitch?

44:49.604 --> 44:51.344
Why do you hit your child?

44:51.856 --> 44:55.064
Who? Who hit his child?

44:55.943 --> 44:57.604
You may not know,

44:57.862 --> 45:02.822
but that girl has problems.

45:02.867 --> 45:07.486
When she can't control her own anger,
she bashes her head into things.

45:07.496 --> 45:10.203
Just like her mother.
Go on and tell her.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.368
- Mr. park.
- What?

45:12.251 --> 45:14.958
Don't take this so lightly.

45:15.504 --> 45:19.372
I've warned
you several times already.

45:19.383 --> 45:22.875
Okay, so I got a little drunk

45:23.596 --> 45:27.839
and that... did that thing before.

45:27.850 --> 45:33.265
Since your mother passed, and
I understand you're upset.

45:36.609 --> 45:39.897
Yes, that's why I had a
drink just now.

45:40.613 --> 45:43.150
I'll keep dohee during
the vacation.

45:43.282 --> 45:47.241
After you get yourself together,
you can come and get her.

45:49.914 --> 45:55.034
Okay, if you insist.

45:55.044 --> 45:58.787
If that's what you want.

45:58.798 --> 45:59.798
Please go.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.170
Hey.

46:03.177 --> 46:08.046
Now you better behave and
do as chief tells you.

46:09.558 --> 46:10.673
Bye.

46:40.965 --> 46:41.965
What is it?

46:45.094 --> 46:46.834
I have to pee.

46:49.223 --> 46:50.463
Come in.

47:01.861 --> 47:05.069
It's all right, I won't look.

47:31.891 --> 47:34.007
Can I go in there too?

47:49.033 --> 47:51.900
So warm!

48:09.428 --> 48:11.384
Can I drink some of this?

48:13.808 --> 48:15.173
You're too young!

48:18.521 --> 48:19.806
Have a taste.

48:35.538 --> 48:37.779
Why do you drink?

48:40.709 --> 48:41.949
To sleep.

48:43.337 --> 48:44.793
You can't sleep?

48:46.465 --> 48:47.796
No.

48:49.093 --> 48:50.093
Why not?

48:54.557 --> 48:55.672
I don't know.

48:57.977 --> 49:04.689
However much I get beaten, if I dance
it off, I feel better and can sleep.

49:06.193 --> 49:08.104
Should I teach you?

49:10.448 --> 49:12.109
I'll just watch you dance.

49:15.953 --> 49:18.444
Grandma hated it.

49:19.832 --> 49:23.074
"Acting like a mutt,
just like her mom!â

49:43.397 --> 49:44.853
It's all right.

49:47.860 --> 49:52.149
You told me if I did nothing wrong,
I shouldn't get beaten.

49:55.784 --> 49:58.992
I was just trying
not to get beat up.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.309
It's so cold!

50:33.906 --> 50:37.319
Chief, it is you!

50:41.455 --> 50:45.323
It's funny seeing you here.

50:46.085 --> 50:47.325
Hello.

50:54.051 --> 50:57.043
- The water is so cold
- Isn't this yong-ha's daughter?

50:57.721 --> 50:59.962
Did you come here to
hang out with the chief?

51:33.090 --> 51:36.082
I'm here to see chief
Lee young-nam.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.285
I'm going out...

52:09.293 --> 52:13.161
No, I'm taking the day off.
Please wrap things up for me.

52:13.380 --> 52:14.745
Yes, ma'am.

52:25.684 --> 52:27.174
You're home early!

52:27.561 --> 52:28.801
You're here?

52:35.944 --> 52:36.944
Hi.

53:08.227 --> 53:09.967
Lock the door, okay?

53:10.479 --> 53:13.095
When are you coming back?
Where are you going?

53:13.107 --> 53:15.473
I'll be back late.
Don't wait up.

53:36.964 --> 53:38.750
Didn't know you'd be
in a place like this.

53:43.095 --> 53:44.585
You cut your hair.

53:45.597 --> 53:46.962
It looks tacky.

53:52.521 --> 53:57.265
Did you have to do this?
Did you have to come so far?

54:02.781 --> 54:03.896
I'm sorry.

54:32.519 --> 54:35.556
Why don't you pick up?
It keeps ringing.

54:40.944 --> 54:41.944
Hey.

54:44.281 --> 54:46.192
I'll be home later. Go to bed.

54:49.453 --> 54:50.693
Who is that kid?

54:53.457 --> 54:56.574
She's from the neighborhood.
I'm looking after her for now.

54:57.461 --> 55:00.077
Why don't you eat?
You said you're hungry.

55:05.594 --> 55:08.461
You used to say alcohol is bitter
when you drink alone.

55:25.739 --> 55:29.823
Can't we start over?

55:32.454 --> 55:35.366
Should I move down here?

55:47.761 --> 55:51.094
I'm moving to Australia.

56:01.650 --> 56:05.017
Good for you.
You always wanted to go.

56:07.406 --> 56:09.146
Did I say I wanted to go alone?

56:24.006 --> 56:25.291
You're always like this.

56:26.133 --> 56:29.671
You get hurt a bit,
and then run away.

56:53.702 --> 56:55.067
You're drunk. Sleep over.

56:56.580 --> 56:59.162
You're the one who's drunk.
You're always drunk.

56:59.291 --> 57:01.077
You can't even sleep
without drinking.

57:02.336 --> 57:04.042
Why do you still drink so much?

57:04.046 --> 57:05.957
Why do you care?
You're going to Australia.

58:06.024 --> 58:07.139
Over here!

58:17.160 --> 58:18.775
Sorry to call you out this late.

58:18.787 --> 58:21.153
No worries!

58:21.289 --> 58:22.904
I wasn't sleeping.

58:23.291 --> 58:27.034
My friend is a bit drunk. Can you
drive her to the inn down the road?

58:27.671 --> 58:28.671
Yes, ma'am.

59:31.485 --> 59:32.725
What's wrong with you?

59:35.489 --> 59:36.729
What are you doing?

59:37.949 --> 59:39.234
Why are you doing this?

59:40.368 --> 59:41.733
I need a beating.

59:43.371 --> 59:45.362
I didn't behave.

59:56.093 --> 59:58.755
Are you crazy?
Did you do this to yourself?

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.509
You don't beat me.

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:10.763
If you're mad,
you can just beat me.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:16.359
I'm not mad. Stop, I'm not mad.

01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:17.913
Don't do this!

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:21.549
That boy is gone mad.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.712
He's throwing off
all the seed oysters.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:28.090
That fucker has lost it.
He's been complaining lately.

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:30.592
- That bastard.
- Just calm down.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.449
What's the matter?

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:50.873
Tell me.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:52.583
Please send me home.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:58.086
I don't need money.
Please let me go.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:00.122
I have to go now.
Please send me home.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:09.256
Please send me home.
My mom is very sick.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:14.261
Send you home?
Is someone stopping you?

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:37.034
Are you an illegal immigrant?

01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:56.053
Mr. park.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:03:01.062
You're aware that hiring
illegals and skimping on wages

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:02.809
is in violation of the law?

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:06.780
What did I do to deserve this, huh?

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.775
Only thing I did was work my ass
off to make this town prosperous.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:13.324
Why didn't you allow your worker
to leave and see his sick mother?

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.913
This is nuts.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:19.705
It's not so simple, you know?

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:24.415
If I send him home, the rest will
line up with their own requests.

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:27.338
- So I suggest...
- Mr. park.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.927
You know what a broker is?

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:33.594
A broker is as liable as the owner,
and both will be punished.

01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:36.593
A low-grade broker like you
will get even harsher punishment.

01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:38.845
Oh fuck!

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:42.057
Who the hell are you accusing?

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:52.443
I don't know how many times
I've warned you.

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:53.569
Listen carefully.

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:58.494
Pay off the wages you owe
and send him home immediately.

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:03.586
Otherwise, the police and immigration
will pursue this together.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.126
If you've understood, then leave.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.626
You're really out to get me.

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:12.630
Now, I'm getting eager to
talk as well.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:16.883
I saw you doing something at night
with that woman from Seoul.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:21.514
I wish the fuck someone
would ask me what I saw.

01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:32.903
What the hell are you
talking about?

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:35.906
When she lets you go, then leave.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.280
Wait, I wasn't the only one.
Bakeem saw it too.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.657
Get out of here.

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:43.159
So don't take me so lightly!

01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:47.164
- I told you to leave!
- Go.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:10.186
Where have you been this late?

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:14.070
Do you know what time it is?

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:19.325
School starts tomorrow.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.664
I went home to get my uniform.

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:24.201
School starts tomorrow?

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:47.439
I think I've gained weight.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:56.118
Let me see.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:17.337
You've grown taller
too, sun dohee.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:25.011
You smell like alcohol.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.774
- Dohee.
- Yeah?

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:15.937
Vacation is over.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.445
Go back home.

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.579
I brought my clothes here.

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:34.709
I met my dad.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.801
He tried to hit me again,
so I ran back here.

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:40.597
Dohee.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:47.219
I'm not your mother.

01:07:49.357 --> 01:07:51.222
I'll find your mother.

01:07:58.866 --> 01:07:59.866
No!

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:40.859
I'm sorry.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:49.368
From now on, I'll be obedient, and I
won't throw my clothes everywhere.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:53.118
I won't eat with my bare hands.

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:59.249
Can you forgive me?

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:08.508
I don't need a mom.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:12.094
I don't need anyone.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.270
I just need you.

01:09:31.876 --> 01:09:32.876
It's done.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.040
Let's buy your summer uniform
for next year too.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:44.924
Wow, it's hot.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:49.265
Trimming some veggies?
We're here.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:54.638
It's hot.

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:56.305
It's so hot.

01:09:56.317 --> 01:10:00.185
Let's just do our nails.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:05.069
Whatever happened to
our quiet town?

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:09.069
That bakeem or whatever...
Crazy bastard's got a bad temper.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:13.073
He looks like some kind of
beast, too.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.666
Words won't persuade him.

01:10:17.422 --> 01:10:20.459
I don't think holding him up
will be enough,

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:24.710
since the rest of the workers
are all riled up too.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:29.547
It's so hard to find help.

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:33.103
There. You happy?

01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:47.451
Let's go.

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:56.241
- They have the same haircut
- Oh my god!

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:01.705
Go in. Hurry.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:08.632
I'll behave. I'll do anything.

01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:10.254
So please...

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:41.346
Where's that man from India?

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:44.689
Bakeem?

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:51.982
He's not here.

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:05.578
He went back home?

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:23.721
So you were kicked out at last!

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:34.275
Woman keep you around
for months on end?

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.866
Even your own mom abandoned you.

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:37.781
What's this?

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:42.532
What's this? Let me see.

01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:45.789
Let me see.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:51.670
I guess she's telling you to
take this and fuck off.

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:53.296
No!

01:13:57.808 --> 01:14:05.808
Now that I see you,
you've grown a bit.

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:09.935
You're looking a bit
like a girl now.

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:23.198
Did the two of you do anything?

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:29.579
That woman from Seoul
was supposedly her lover.

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:34.425
She was kicked out because
of trouble with girl on girl love.

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:38.467
Girls doing things with girls.
Do you even know what that is?

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:41.216
They're those kinds of bitches.

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:45.345
Tell me the truth.

01:14:46.357 --> 01:14:48.814
You two did something, huh?

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:51.184
She took you to do
those things to you, right?

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:52.685
No!

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:12.622
Hey.

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:35.899
What's wrong with you?

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.026
Are you gonna go to that woman?

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:41.025
Is that why you bought
me clothes?

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.777
So you can go back
to that woman?

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:01.674
Come inside.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.681
Hello!

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:15.186
I thought something weird
was going on here,

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:16.811
but this is some shit.

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:18.813
What are you talking about?

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:23.158
Did I startle you?
You thought no one knew?

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:27.572
You take all the sweetness
of a little girl.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.450
Now that she's all grown up,
you lost interest?

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:44.679
What did you say to him?

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:47.926
What did you tell him?

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:55.224
You two do whatever you want.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.990
I'm back.

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:13.993
Damn, it's hot.

01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:17.751
Captain eom! Come quickly.

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:19.123
Hurry, let's go.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.251
What's the matter?

01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:23.253
Fuck.

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:28.509
That fucker bakeem
is trashing the office.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.136
Let's go. Contact the station.

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:35.515
We can probably handle
it ourselves.

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:36.766
Hurry.

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:37.983
I'm on it.

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:45.484
You fucking bastard.
How dare you trash this place?

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:49.995
You crazy asshole.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:56.001
Motherfucker.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:06.045
What are you looking at, fuckers?

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:09.302
You want to die, assholes?

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:11.266
Fucker.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:15.559
Motherfucker.

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.556
Look at me.

01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:28.818
Hey!

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.912
That's enough. Chief is here.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:36.417
This fucker doesn't
know his place.

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:38.043
Stop it!

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.420
What? What are they doing?

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:52.470
- Arrest them both.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:53.968
What're you doing?

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:56.186
- Just come quietly.
- What're you doing?

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:57.350
Let's go.

01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:59.849
He started this commotion.
Why are you arresting me?

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:00.940
Let's go.

01:19:00.945 --> 01:19:02.731
Call my boss. Call Mr. choi.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.603
We went to escort him too.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:05.945
Fuck.

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:08.066
You think I'll go quietly?

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.362
Calm down and let's go.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:12.612
Why the fuck are you taking me?

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:14.454
He's the one who started it.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.490
What're we going to do now?

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:19.869
This summer's hard
enough as it is.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:24.590
You stop the workers from working,
and now you arrest yong-ha.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:29.379
Station chief or whatever,

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:31.472
she pulls rank
and sticks her nose in everything.

01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:34.888
- You said it.
- Stop it now.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:39.143
Get on out of here.

01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:40.514
Go.

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.279
Are you hungry?

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.335
Let's go.

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:56.924
Now that school's in session,
do kids still bother you?

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:06.226
They're afraid of you,
so they leave me alone.

01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:08.852
Do you hang out with them?

01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:14.483
They're no fun anyway.

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:45.768
You have to come with us.

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:51.236
Yong-ha reported
you to the police.

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:54.899
For sexual molestation of a minor.

01:21:56.787 --> 01:22:00.245
I don't know what's going on.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:04.912
All right,
I'll follow you in a moment.

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:07.915
You have to come now.
This is a warrantless arrest.

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:23.306
Why'd you keep her at your house
instead of sending her home?

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:29.775
That day too,

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.444
she got beat up by her father and
came to me battered and bruised.

01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:40.661
It was best to keep her away
from that man.

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:46.159
I understand the initial situation.

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:50.038
But afterwards too,
you kept her around,

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:52.334
even though she has her own
family and home.

01:22:53.177 --> 01:22:54.212
Understand?

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.342
What did you do during that time?

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:02.717
What do you mean by that?

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:14.478
You know this person?

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:21.364
You stayed at her place
for a month, right?

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.616
Was she nice to you?

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:34.624
Did she adore you?

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:38.005
Yes.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.130
What I'm asking is,

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:46.010
why'd you take in
a girl who has a family?

01:23:46.396 --> 01:23:48.352
It seems pretty abnormal.

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:56.397
That girl has been exposed to
violence since she was very young.

01:23:57.783 --> 01:24:01.367
She was conditioned to violence
and was in a perilous state.

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:07.281
That's why I believed she needed
special protection.

01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:09.283
According to her father,

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:12.912
the girl's behavior
toward you was not normal.

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:15.915
It's true that she likes me.

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:17.666
But the reason is...

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:26.555
Because I wear a police uniform,
and I confront bad men,

01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:29.932
and look powerful.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:31.897
That's all.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:37.190
Was there any physical contact
while she stayed with you?

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:42.567
Was there physical contact?

01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:44.318
What contact?

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:48.447
What are you talking about?

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:53.293
Did you take the girl's clothes off
and touch her?

01:25:05.309 --> 01:25:10.975
Did the chief say you're pretty
and touch you?

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:13.430
My body?

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:15.318
Yes.

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:17.695
Yes.

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:21.731
What about the first night
you slept over?

01:25:23.577 --> 01:25:24.987
We took a bath.

01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:28.111
She took off your clothes
and washed you?

01:25:28.999 --> 01:25:32.116
No, we bathed together.

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:45.630
Can you show me where
she touched you?

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:51.510
L...

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:08.153
I had no abnormal intentions making
physical contact with that child.

01:26:08.372 --> 01:26:13.162
Did you take off her clothes
and touch her or not?

01:26:16.797 --> 01:26:17.797
I did.

01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:25.044
I took her clothes off and
saw the bruises from beating.

01:26:25.055 --> 01:26:26.511
And I bathed her.

01:26:28.517 --> 01:26:31.384
The bruises seemed so painful
that I even hugged her.

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:33.142
Is there something
wrong with that?

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:37.557
It becomes a problem
when a homosexual does it.

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:43.903
You're a homosexual, aren't you?

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:50.070
Here from Seoul because of
a similar problem, right?

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:53.663
Correct?

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:57.952
If it's not true, answer me.
Why can't you talk?

01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:32.570
I'm not going to answer
that question.

01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:38.116
Because I'm not obligated to do so.

01:27:40.005 --> 01:27:43.247
Sure, but it's your loss.

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:56.221
All I did was to take care of a girl
with a history of abuse.

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:02.641
I thought it was my duty to
protect her.

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:06.019
That's all.

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:11.525
Point out

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:14.119
where the chief touched you.

01:28:56.331 --> 01:29:02.201
Did she ever hit
you when you refused?

01:29:03.046 --> 01:29:04.456
The chief...

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:10.209
She touched me because
she adored me.

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:16.556
I liked her,
so I hugged and kissed her.

01:29:26.987 --> 01:29:27.987
Chief!

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:30.354
Let me go!

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:33.072
- Chief, let me go with you!
- Bring her out!

01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:34.737
Let me go!

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:35.824
Chief!

01:29:36.329 --> 01:29:39.116
- Let me go with her!
- Calm down!

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:53.381
I don't get it. How could you
do that to a little girl?

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:56.880
Has it been a fucking month
since I said to be careful?

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:01.763
Are you sick or something?

01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:07.725
Jun-ho.

01:30:10.488 --> 01:30:11.898
Sorry to bother you.

01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:17.569
Can you take these off for me?

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:26.163
Uncuff her.

01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:54.942
What about chief?

01:30:56.326 --> 01:30:57.941
Didn't you see her at the station?

01:30:59.579 --> 01:31:00.694
I saw her.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.446
She's not coming back for a while.

01:31:06.336 --> 01:31:07.336
Why not?

01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:11.455
If she really did those
things to you,

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:16.335
she has to be punished.

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:18.044
She'll be sent to prison.

01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:23.967
What about dad?

01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:29.473
Your father settled with bakeem.

01:31:30.986 --> 01:31:32.601
He'll be home sometime today.

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:52.496
You have a cell phone?

01:31:56.386 --> 01:31:57.386
Let me see it.

01:32:11.276 --> 01:32:13.232
From now on,
if your dad hits you again.

01:32:15.989 --> 01:32:17.229
Call this number.

01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:38.258
You ever poured liquor before?
You're pretty good at it.

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:10.449
Girl.

01:33:12.796 --> 01:33:16.539
You need to take care
of your body from an early age.

01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:23.716
Or you're going to fuck up
your life like your mother.

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:43.607
You fell hard for that
perverted bitch.

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:46.985
Throwing yourself at her like that.

01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:49.863
Girl.

01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:52.334
What?

01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:54.868
What?

01:33:55.505 --> 01:33:58.747
Fucking retard, acting like a fool.

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:00.467
What?

01:34:03.012 --> 01:34:06.880
What did you say, bitch?
Are you copying your mom?

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:16.900
Hit me.

01:34:17.527 --> 01:34:18.527
Hit me.

01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:22.479
Only thing you're good at
is beating women, right?

01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:31.246
Must be out of your fucking mind.

01:34:35.628 --> 01:34:38.040
You crazy bitch.

01:34:38.047 --> 01:34:40.538
You've been acting weird all day.

01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:47.550
Why're you acting like your mom,
you fucking bitch?

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:20.224
Dad, I'm sorry.

01:38:51.926 --> 01:38:53.882
It hurts so much.

01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:56.304
What?

01:38:58.266 --> 01:38:59.756
It hurts.

01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:13.816
What did you just say, bitch?

01:39:13.823 --> 01:39:17.816
Please.

01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:21.945
I'll do anything you want.
Please.

01:39:23.332 --> 01:39:26.950
What the fuck did you say, bitch?

01:39:31.841 --> 01:39:34.048
Fucking bitch!

01:39:41.726 --> 01:39:45.969
Shut up.

01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:49.723
You'd better shut up, bitch!

01:39:54.864 --> 01:39:58.482
You'd better shut up.

01:40:01.996 --> 01:40:05.864
Policeman Kwon

01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:08.867
shut up, bitch!

01:40:12.882 --> 01:40:14.622
Park yong-ha!

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:23.756
Freeze, bastard!

01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:32.395
What the fuck?

01:40:32.401 --> 01:40:33.891
- Hurry and go.
- Okay.

01:40:34.362 --> 01:40:36.774
- Get up, asshole.
- Get up!

01:40:38.783 --> 01:40:39.783
Get out.

01:40:42.787 --> 01:40:44.243
What're you doing?

01:40:47.667 --> 01:40:48.782
Go.

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:52.039
Fucking bitch!

01:40:57.385 --> 01:40:59.876
- Fucking hell.
- Goin.

01:40:59.929 --> 01:41:01.009
Come here, fucker.

01:41:02.557 --> 01:41:05.765
- Let me use the bathroom.
- Okay.

01:41:06.936 --> 01:41:10.645
Stay still, bastard.

01:41:10.648 --> 01:41:15.062
- Take it easy. Fuck.
- Goin.

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:26.030
You! Fucking mutt!

01:41:26.831 --> 01:41:29.413
Fucking bitch!

01:41:30.459 --> 01:41:34.452
You fucking bitch!
Fucking bitches.

01:41:34.463 --> 01:41:37.205
Fucking bitches!

01:41:41.596 --> 01:41:44.713
You filthy bitches!

01:41:55.568 --> 01:41:58.184
You remember coming
here last time?

01:42:03.993 --> 01:42:06.109
Let me ask a couple
more questions.

01:42:07.455 --> 01:42:12.324
So you're saying that your father
told you what to say last time?

01:42:14.462 --> 01:42:15.462
Yes.

01:42:17.006 --> 01:42:20.248
How?
Do you remember what he said?

01:42:24.597 --> 01:42:28.089
He told me to say that chief wanted
to take me to live with her,

01:42:29.769 --> 01:42:31.760
and to sleep with me every day.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.141
So,

01:42:34.148 --> 01:42:37.515
when you said chief touched you
and bathed you,

01:42:37.526 --> 01:42:39.642
that was what your dad
told you to say?

01:42:40.279 --> 01:42:41.279
Yes.

01:42:41.530 --> 01:42:43.646
What else did your father say?

01:42:45.368 --> 01:42:49.407
He told me to never talk
about him beating me.

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:56.409
To never talk about
things like yesterday.

01:42:58.506 --> 01:43:01.248
That he'd kill me and throw me
in the sea.

01:43:02.176 --> 01:43:08.422
He said if he dumped me far out,
no one will know.

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:18.022
It's as you said.

01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:22.439
After her mother left,
her father continued to beat her.

01:43:23.322 --> 01:43:27.816
If she wasn't obedient while he
sexually abused her, he'd beat her.

01:43:33.082 --> 01:43:37.826
Is that what the girl said?

01:43:39.714 --> 01:43:42.456
She spoke out quite well.

01:43:43.175 --> 01:43:47.339
She said she went to your house
to hide from her father.

01:43:54.437 --> 01:43:58.055
I owe you an apology.

01:43:59.817 --> 01:44:01.102
I don't know what to say.

01:44:05.114 --> 01:44:10.108
What happens to the child?

01:44:12.621 --> 01:44:18.457
If the mom doesn't show up, we'll have
to send her to protective custody.

01:44:46.655 --> 01:44:48.395
Check underneath the desk.

01:44:58.042 --> 01:44:59.042
Hey.

01:44:59.919 --> 01:45:02.786
Escort the chief back to her place.

01:45:05.007 --> 01:45:09.546
We'll take care of your things
and send it to you.

01:45:09.553 --> 01:45:13.011
Or we can send it directly
to where you get transferred.

01:45:22.566 --> 01:45:25.933
Thank you for all your hard work.

01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:52.300
Soon-oh.

01:45:53.055 --> 01:45:54.340
Yes, ma'am.

01:45:58.686 --> 01:46:01.348
What happened that night?

01:46:02.356 --> 01:46:05.314
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

01:46:06.569 --> 01:46:08.855
You caught Mr. park in the act.

01:46:10.489 --> 01:46:12.946
How was that possible?

01:46:14.076 --> 01:46:16.488
I gave her my number.

01:46:17.746 --> 01:46:20.237
She called me that night.

01:46:20.958 --> 01:46:24.871
She must've dialed in a hurry.

01:46:25.588 --> 01:46:27.078
She didn't say anything.

01:46:28.007 --> 01:46:33.593
But I heard her father breathing
and cursing, and the girl crying.

01:46:33.596 --> 01:46:35.507
I could tell what was going on.

01:46:35.764 --> 01:46:38.130
So I called it in
and rushed to the scene.

01:46:39.894 --> 01:46:44.388
It's crazy that a father has been
doing that to his daughter.

01:47:39.536 --> 01:47:40.776
Dohee.

01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:48.291
Did you do it?

01:47:54.093 --> 01:47:56.459
Did you do that to
him on purpose?

01:48:25.457 --> 01:48:26.572
What about your grandma?

01:48:42.599 --> 01:48:43.634
What about grandma?

01:49:21.889 --> 01:49:24.050
You don't ever have to
worry about him again.

01:49:25.184 --> 01:49:26.765
He won't be able
to see you again.

01:49:36.695 --> 01:49:38.151
I have to go.

01:49:43.577 --> 01:49:46.819
Eat well and don't miss school.

01:49:48.582 --> 01:49:51.415
It's dangerous so don't roam
around at night, okay?

01:50:41.385 --> 01:50:46.129
I don't know if
it's appropriate to say this.

01:50:47.141 --> 01:50:51.134
I feel bad for dohee,

01:50:52.771 --> 01:50:55.638
but I don't get a good feeling
about her.

01:50:58.152 --> 01:51:01.519
Maybe because her mother ran
away and she was abused.

01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:05.147
She's different from other kids.

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:08.404
I can't figure her out.

01:51:10.372 --> 01:51:13.489
She doesn't seem like a child.

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:17.413
Sometimes, she seems
like a little monster.

01:51:20.507 --> 01:51:23.374
Sorry, I'm in no position
to speak on this matter.

01:51:29.391 --> 01:51:30.801
Can you stop the car?

01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:33.301
What's wrong?

01:51:33.562 --> 01:51:36.520
I forgot something.
I need to get out here.

01:53:25.173 --> 01:53:28.882
Will you go with me?
