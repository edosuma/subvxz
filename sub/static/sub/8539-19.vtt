[theme music]

00:14.449 --> 00:16.842
[upbeat music]

00:32.336 --> 00:34.730
[indistinct chattering]

00:36.601 --> 00:38.560
Victim is Felix Hanson, 47.

00:38.647 --> 00:39.952
Took three bullets to the chest.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.302
No weapon found.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.912
The coroner estimates
the shooting occurred

00:42.999 --> 00:44.609
sometime between
midnight and 3:00 a.m.

00:44.696 --> 00:45.697
Why is this one ours, boss?

00:45.784 --> 00:46.959
Looks like a mugging to me.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.135
Hollywood homicide
can handle that.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.832
It came from the big brass.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.442
Hanson was super rich,
and he was

00:51.529 --> 00:54.271
a California State
Representative for six years.

00:54.358 --> 00:56.621
[Patrick]
'Golfing buddy of
the attorney general?'

00:56.708 --> 00:58.667
Correct, but not quite fair.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.669
Hanson was a good guy.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.671
[Teresa]
'He headed a campaign
against the drug trade.'

01:02.758 --> 01:06.066
He kicked butt, named names,
and made a lotta enemies.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.111
Wait a second.
I know this guy.

01:08.198 --> 01:11.680
He's semi-famous, he, uh,
he was married to Felicia Scott.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.029
She left the movies for him.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.726
Felicia Scott?

01:14.813 --> 01:17.251
Oh, come on. You know, she's
been in loads of movies.

01:17.338 --> 01:20.080
'"Sudden Embrace."
Love that movie.'

01:20.167 --> 01:23.561
Okay, my point is, if this
is drug-related, The AG

01:23.648 --> 01:26.738
is gonna wanna use all of his
resources to close this case.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.740
Anybody hear shots,
see what happened?

01:28.827 --> 01:30.002
Nobody's come forward so far

01:30.090 --> 01:31.613
but, uh, Marilyn Monroe

01:31.700 --> 01:33.528
and Charlie Chaplin over there..

01:33.615 --> 01:35.356
'They were with Hanson
when the first officer arrived'

01:35.443 --> 01:36.618
'on the scene.'

01:36.705 --> 01:37.706
[Wayne]
'Any kids?'

01:37.793 --> 01:39.316
Daughter, 16.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.103
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.669
You didn't happen to
pick up a set of car keys

01:44.756 --> 01:46.323
off this guy, did you?

01:46.410 --> 01:47.716
Uh, no.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.109
Valet ticket?

01:49.196 --> 01:51.937
- No, nothing in the pockets.
- Hmm.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.810
- Nobody walks in LA.
- No. No, they don't.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.859
[Kimball]
'So you didn't
hear anything unusual?'

02:00.946 --> 02:03.688
And where were you going
when you found the victim?

02:03.775 --> 02:04.907
I don't speak, uh.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.388
In the movies, no.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.693
But here in the
real world, you speak.

02:08.780 --> 02:09.825
You just did.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.000
I'm saying nothing more.

02:11.087 --> 02:13.872
Five hours we've been here.

02:13.959 --> 02:16.136
For the umpteenth time,
I was going home from work.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.702
Victor was
walking me to my car.

02:17.789 --> 02:20.792
And what is your work?

02:20.879 --> 02:23.055
I'm Marilyn.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.666
How is that your work?

02:24.753 --> 02:25.971
I stand on the street.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.278
People take photos
of me and give me tips.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.541
- Why?
- I don't know.

02:30.628 --> 02:33.414
Where are you from?

02:33.501 --> 02:36.591
- What are you staring at?
- You.

02:36.678 --> 02:38.288
What's your real name?

02:38.375 --> 02:40.247
Norma Jean Baker.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.031
What's your real real name?

02:42.118 --> 02:43.902
Yolanda Quinn.

02:43.989 --> 02:47.515
Yolanda, you don't actually look
very much like Marilyn at all.

02:47.602 --> 02:48.820
You do this kind
of work 'cause you feel

02:48.907 --> 02:51.127
a deep connection
with her, yeah?

02:51.214 --> 02:52.607
- I guess.
- Yeah.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.913
She was a lonesome
soul, poor woman.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.657
Longed for affection, attention,
acceptance. She got it.

02:59.744 --> 03:02.269
She came out here, and she
worked hard, and she struggled

03:02.356 --> 03:05.620
and she got it, all the love
and respect that she longed for.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.404
And you can too. You will.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.711
You will, Yolanda, if you
do the right thing now.

03:10.842 --> 03:13.018
What thing?

03:13.105 --> 03:14.890
Hand over the
valet ticket, Yolanda

03:14.977 --> 03:16.892
that you stole
from the dead man.

03:18.589 --> 03:19.721
I haven't got any valet ticket.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.636
Then tell Charlie
to hand it over.

03:25.944 --> 03:28.382
- Give him the ticket.
- Son of a bitch.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.427
Give it!

03:31.863 --> 03:33.213
Thank you.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.998
- Can we go?
- Sure.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.042
I'll keep the cops at bay.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.609
You guys run.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.785
Run! Run!

03:40.872 --> 03:42.570
Go, go, go, go, go. Run!

03:42.657 --> 03:44.441
[Cho]
'Nice.
I could arrest you for that.'

03:44.528 --> 03:45.921
You'll never take
me alive, copper.

03:46.008 --> 03:47.401
Seriously.

03:47.488 --> 03:48.837
Seriously,
it's Marilynand Charlie.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.534
What, do you wanna
make a comedy arrest

03:50.621 --> 03:53.145
see your name written
in the weird news section?

04:02.677 --> 04:04.069
Where did he valet?

04:04.156 --> 04:05.593
At Musso & Frank's,
down the block.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.464
After you're done here,
go back to the restaurant.

04:07.551 --> 04:08.944
Go through
the credit card receipts.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.685
Find out who he was having
dinner with last night.

04:10.772 --> 04:11.773
Will do.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.561
[Wayne]
'Uh, boss? Uh, whoa.'

04:22.000 --> 04:24.002
So I guess it
is drug trade related

04:24.089 --> 04:26.440
but not in a good guy way.

04:28.529 --> 04:30.922
[theme music]

04:37.842 --> 04:39.279
I want to pull back
really, really slowly.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.192
Then I want to pick up
a little piece of that

04:40.280 --> 04:41.324
and do a tilt up, okay?

04:41.411 --> 04:42.586
And at the same time
simultaneously

04:42.673 --> 04:44.371
they're gonna
come to the window

04:44.458 --> 04:45.720
and we're gonna catch them
when they come out the window.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.809
- Gabriel Fanning?
- Yeah, that's me.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.593
CBI.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.335
We wanna talk to you
about Felix Hanson.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.859
Why? What did he do?

04:54.946 --> 04:58.341
- He died last night.
- What?

04:58.428 --> 05:00.517
Is there somewhere we can talk?

05:00.604 --> 05:01.736
Yeah, back over here.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.131
Last night at dinner with Felix,
both of your credit cards

05:06.218 --> 05:08.090
were charged at 11:30.

05:08.177 --> 05:10.092
You stay at the restaurant
much longer?

05:10.179 --> 05:11.963
No, we left soon after that.

05:13.443 --> 05:16.228
We were havin'
a good time, but, um..

05:16.316 --> 05:18.274
...I wanted to be
up early this morning.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.884
Tomorrow is the first day
of production.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.233
What is the production?

05:21.321 --> 05:22.365
"A Dozen Roses."

05:22.452 --> 05:24.062
I'm directing.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.455
Felix financed the picture.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.022
That's why we
were having dinner.

05:27.109 --> 05:29.372
We were celebrating his
first foray as a film producer.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.548
How did he get
into film producing?

05:31.635 --> 05:34.899
He's, uh, married
to Felicia Scott.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.336
She's starring in the movie.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.120
Felicia Scott.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.035
Remind me?

05:40.122 --> 05:42.342
Come on. Felicia Scott?

05:42.429 --> 05:43.430
"Love Times Two."

05:43.517 --> 05:44.953
"Baby, You're Mine."

05:45.040 --> 05:47.434
- "Sudden Embrace."
- "Sudden Embrace."

05:47.521 --> 05:48.870
Sounds familiar.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.393
Those were all a while
back though, weren't they?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.308
She looks better
now than she did then.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.527
Just as good, anyhow.

05:53.614 --> 05:54.963
So what's this movie about?

05:55.050 --> 05:56.834
Uh, a mother's quest
to find good men

05:56.921 --> 05:58.227
for her three daughters.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.881
It's funny,
it's moving, it's sexy.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.884
- Can I read it?
- No you can't read it.

06:02.971 --> 06:04.712
It's about family,
and redemption, and--

06:04.799 --> 06:05.843
Gotcha.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.585
Did you and Felix get along?

06:08.672 --> 06:10.500
'You ever have any arguments?'

06:10.587 --> 06:13.242
I loved him. Loved him.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.200
So many people in
this town are phonies.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.681
But Felix Hanson, he was real.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.857
Felix, he didn't
like something, he'd say so.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.859
What in particular
did he not like?

06:21.946 --> 06:23.165
Nothing.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.080
I'm just saying in general.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.995
He was like that. Real.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.693
[Teresa]
'How much did he have
invested in the film?'

06:29.780 --> 06:31.695
- Ten.
- Million?

06:31.782 --> 06:32.957
- 'Of his own money?'
- Yep.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.263
He's was a brave man.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.612
Doing it all
for Felicia, of course

06:35.699 --> 06:38.006
not just for
the potential profits.

06:38.093 --> 06:40.182
Did you two leave
the restaurant together?

06:40.269 --> 06:42.227
We walked out together, yeah.

06:42.314 --> 06:44.316
Was anybody waiting for him?

06:44.404 --> 06:45.709
I didn't see anybody.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.189
I parked my car down the street.

06:47.276 --> 06:50.366
We shook hands
and said goodbye.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.847
Do you own a gun, Gabriel?

06:52.934 --> 06:53.935
No.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.502
I like guns..

06:55.589 --> 06:58.026
...but I'm afraid
of blowing my own head off.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.288
Ah.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.118
What do you think?

07:03.205 --> 07:04.336
Oh, he's lying.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.990
They had
an argument last night.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.036
You go out to celebrate with
the man that financed your movie

07:08.123 --> 07:09.472
and you only pay
half the dinner bill?

07:09.559 --> 07:12.170
[cellphone ringing]

07:12.257 --> 07:13.824
Van Pelt?

07:13.911 --> 07:15.086
We need Gabriel Fanning's
cellphone records

07:15.173 --> 07:16.871
'from last night.'

07:16.958 --> 07:18.916
Sure, and while I have you,
the last number dialed

07:19.003 --> 07:20.962
on Hanson's cell was blocked

07:21.049 --> 07:23.094
so I had the phone
company trace it.

07:23.181 --> 07:26.968
- Belongs to a Frederick Ross.
- Who?

07:27.055 --> 07:29.536
Oh, just a convicted felon
with multiple possession

07:29.623 --> 07:31.276
and assault charges.

07:31.363 --> 07:33.975
Beautiful. Find out where he is
and have the boys pick him up.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.106
[Van]
'Okay.'

07:35.193 --> 07:36.151
'Wait a minute.'

07:36.238 --> 07:37.500
I know this guy.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.502
He-he's on that beer commercial.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.852
Oh, the one with the llama?

07:41.939 --> 07:43.680
What?

07:43.767 --> 07:44.725
[Van]
'This Ross guy.'

07:44.812 --> 07:46.422
He must be an actor too.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.816
You know that beer commercial
with the guy wearing the toga?

07:48.903 --> 07:50.948
Oh, yeah, yeah, and we're
all supposed to be surprised

07:51.035 --> 07:52.428
when the toga gets
caught in the elevator.

07:52.515 --> 07:53.908
'Yeah, that's him.'

07:53.995 --> 07:55.779
Weird, huh?

07:55.866 --> 07:57.564
[Teresa]
'Yeah, he should've
stuck to his day job.'

07:57.651 --> 07:59.130
'You have the address?'

07:59.217 --> 08:02.046
Yeah, okay, wait.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.484
- Go pick him up.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.713
We're sorry for your loss.

08:19.890 --> 08:21.805
How long were you two together?

08:24.242 --> 08:26.984
We've been married
almost eight years now.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.117
Where were you last night?

08:29.204 --> 08:30.858
Palm Springs.

08:30.945 --> 08:34.426
Felix insisted I have a spa
weekend before filming started.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.822
- And you?
- At home.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.128
Was there anybody
in your husband's life

08:40.215 --> 08:41.782
who posed a threat to him?

08:41.869 --> 08:44.088
'Somebody he didn't
feel safe around?'

08:44.175 --> 08:46.047
- No.
- We found--

08:46.134 --> 08:48.528
What was it that first
attracted you to your husband?

08:48.615 --> 08:50.138
Not his looks.

08:51.574 --> 08:52.749
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.011
He not your type.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.100
And what is my type?

08:56.187 --> 08:57.885
Oh, uh..

09:00.017 --> 09:03.673
Sporty bad boys with
a hidden masochistic streak.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.806
Uh-huh.

09:05.893 --> 09:08.460
Not too bright.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.897
Not even close.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.768
No, that was a bull's eye.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.988
So what did you
like about Felix?

09:14.075 --> 09:17.034
His voice,
his self-assurance.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.256
I don't understand how
these questions are relevant.

09:21.343 --> 09:24.476
Oh, no reason,
just, uh, curious.

09:26.783 --> 09:29.569
We found a large bag of
marijuana and various other

09:29.656 --> 09:32.789
prescription drugs in the
trunk of your husband's car.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.704
- Well, that's absurd.
- Why?

09:34.791 --> 09:38.142
Because Felix didn't
do drugs. Period.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.448
They've been planted.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.888
I'm straight edge.
Have been for years.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.150
Do you know anybody
named Freddie Ross?

09:48.065 --> 09:49.980
No. Who is that?

09:50.067 --> 09:51.199
[cellphone ringing]

09:52.200 --> 09:53.418
It's mine.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.998
It's Gabriel s' assistant.

10:08.085 --> 10:11.132
He wants us to report
to set for rehearsals.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.395
Tell him we'll be there on time.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.527
I'm sure they
would understand if

10:15.615 --> 10:16.659
you don't go
in to work today.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.748
Oh, believe me, I would like to

10:18.835 --> 10:21.621
back out of the whole project.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.058
With Felix gone,
there is no point.

10:24.145 --> 10:27.409
But the insurance company
is holding me to my contract.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.933
They won't even
cover any delays

10:30.020 --> 10:31.761
and I don't wanna
end up in court.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.113
You in the movie too?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.158
Kind of.

10:38.942 --> 10:42.337
We gave her a small speaking
role as one of my daughters.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.167
- Isn't that cute?
- Yeah.

10:49.387 --> 10:52.608
- Do you wanna be an actress?
- Whatever.

10:54.958 --> 10:55.959
Not anymore.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.789
Honey, I know it's hard now

10:59.876 --> 11:01.095
but one day you
might be glad

11:01.182 --> 11:02.487
'that you were
a part of something'

11:02.574 --> 11:04.185
'that was so important
to your father.'

11:04.272 --> 11:07.231
- Ha ha.
- Huh?

11:07.318 --> 11:09.016
He didn't think
this film was important?

11:09.103 --> 11:11.758
No, he thought Gabriel
screwed up the script.

11:11.845 --> 11:14.674
He wanted to back
out of the film.

11:14.761 --> 11:18.068
Oh, don't be a drama queen.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.983
He wasn't happy with
the script, but that's why

11:20.070 --> 11:22.377
he met with Gabriel,
to talk it through.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.248
He wasn't gonna back out.

11:24.335 --> 11:27.382
He may have threatened to
back out to get what he wanted

11:27.469 --> 11:28.731
but that's how it works.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.389
So who's the fella?

11:34.476 --> 11:36.521
- Brandon.
- Brandon who?

11:36.608 --> 11:39.873
- Brandon Fulton.
- Oh, you guys, uh, dating?

11:39.960 --> 11:42.963
Dating? No. Maybe.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.748
Sort of.
That's so nerdy, dating.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.271
Your stepmother
didn't like him?

11:47.358 --> 11:49.230
No, thank you for
not saying anything.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.753
Eh, forget it.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.972
We'll being
seeing you, Sydney.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.150
- Brandon Fulton.
- I'm on it.

12:00.850 --> 12:04.506
Freddie Ross, apartment 23.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.292
Supposedly this
guy's also an actor.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.251
- Was in that beer commercial.
- The one with the llama?

12:10.338 --> 12:11.905
No, the one with
the guy in the toga.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.384
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.170
Stupid.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.261
Nobody home.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.050
- Stop!
- Stop!

12:27.137 --> 12:28.486
- Police!
- Police!

12:28.573 --> 12:29.966
[Kimball]
'Hey, hold it!'

12:30.053 --> 12:31.663
[Wayne]
'Freddie Ross, CBI!'

12:31.751 --> 12:32.752
Hey!

12:36.973 --> 12:38.932
Stop!

12:39.019 --> 12:40.237
- Hey, get out of the car!
- Get out of the car!

12:40.324 --> 12:41.717
Hey, get outta the car!

12:45.416 --> 12:46.591
- Crap.
- It's okay.

12:46.678 --> 12:47.854
I got the plate.

12:57.559 --> 12:58.778
I just spoke to Minelli.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.431
The warrant's on its way.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.477
Okay, boss.
We'll wait here for it.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.696
Yeah, search Ross' place.
The LAPD should be--

13:04.784 --> 13:06.089
[Wayne]
'Yeah, they've been
helpful so far.'

13:06.176 --> 13:07.656
- Uh-huh.
- 'It shouldn't be long.'

13:07.743 --> 13:09.266
- Alright.
- 'We'll keep you posted, boss.'

13:09.353 --> 13:12.574
- Hey, hey, hey, kid.
- 'Hello?'

13:12.661 --> 13:14.184
'It's a closed set.
What does that mean?'

13:14.271 --> 13:15.707
- 'Hello?'
- I'll call you back.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.796
Okay.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.146
Warrant's on its way.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.367
[male #1]
'This is a closed set.'

13:23.454 --> 13:25.587
What's it mean, closed set?

13:25.674 --> 13:27.763
I know what it means,
but they're from the CBI.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.287
I don't care if they're
from a far away galaxy.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.028
This is a closed set, okay?

13:32.115 --> 13:33.638
No gawkers, no fans.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.467
- We're not fans.
- Well, I'm sort of a fan.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.339
California Bureau
of Investigation.

13:38.426 --> 13:41.733
We need to speak
with Gabriel Fanning.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.214
Oh, he can't talk
to you right now.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.390
It's regarding
a murder investigation.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.566
I'm Mitch Cavanaugh,
Gabriel's agent, hey.

13:48.653 --> 13:49.567
- Hey, Mitch.
- How you doing?

13:49.654 --> 13:51.004
Good.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.310
I heard about what
happened to Hanson.

13:53.397 --> 13:57.010
Tragic. I mean,
such a cool guy. Truly.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.489
We're tryin' to make
a movie here though.

13:58.576 --> 14:02.058
Yeah, well, we're trying
to solve a homicide.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.060
He can't talk
to you right now.

14:04.147 --> 14:07.716
You keep this up, I'll have
you arrested for obstruction.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.414
That's unfortunate,
but go ahead.

14:10.501 --> 14:11.807
I understand, Mitch.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.200
Gabriel's one
of your top clients.

14:13.287 --> 14:14.897
You can't lose him.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.768
[laughing]
Right.

14:16.856 --> 14:17.987
No choice, whatever he says.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.771
He says jump, you jump.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.470
Bullied at school, were you?

14:22.557 --> 14:23.906
I was not, actually.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.168
Sure you were.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.300
Even after all these years

14:26.387 --> 14:27.736
you lie awake
sometimes, thinking

14:27.823 --> 14:28.737
of all the ways
that you could wreak

14:28.824 --> 14:31.305
revenge on your tormentors.

14:31.392 --> 14:34.047
And now out of fear and avarice,
you let this man Fanning

14:34.134 --> 14:35.265
bully you the same way.

14:35.352 --> 14:36.876
Mitch, it's the same way.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.703
It's same thing.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.183
You gotta get a life.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.142
Or get arrested.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.061
Go ahead.

14:49.279 --> 14:50.628
That was strong.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.938
Look at the size of this thing.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.899
[rock music]

15:06.079 --> 15:08.516
Great. Mitch, you
little scum sucker.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.999
Class A. You have
a prescription for these?

15:13.086 --> 15:14.652
What is this?
Come on. Jesus!

15:14.739 --> 15:16.785
Sit down. We have a few
follow-up questions for you.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.178
Didn't we do this earlier?

15:18.265 --> 15:19.657
I already answered
all your questions.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.398
Well, that was before we
knew that you were a liar

15:21.485 --> 15:23.009
and a drug abuser.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.011
I don't abuse drugs.
I use them.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.447
They're for creativity.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.362
Ah, but you don't
deny being a liar.

15:28.449 --> 15:29.711
I didn't lie.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.104
I spun the truth
a little bit, maybe.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.933
Why don't you try giving
it to us straight?

15:34.020 --> 15:35.978
Felicia blabbed, didn't she?

15:36.065 --> 15:38.459
Stupid bitch.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.069
Fine.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.724
Yes, Hanson told me last
night that he was pulling

15:42.811 --> 15:44.378
his money out of the movie.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.380
The day before principal
photography, the schmuck.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.121
Without his money,
production would have shut down?

15:48.208 --> 15:49.557
Yes.

15:49.644 --> 15:51.689
This is your first feature
in what, seven years?

15:54.301 --> 15:56.216
Word on the street
is you're a little..

15:56.303 --> 15:58.479
...little difficult
to work with.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.655
Oh, really? Is that what
the word on the street is?

16:00.742 --> 16:02.700
Well, you know what?
Screw the word on the street.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.441
I took some time
out to recharge.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.009
I've been, uh, exploring
other aspects of my life.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.490
Narcotics and despair?

16:11.492 --> 16:13.494
It's been tough, okay?

16:13.581 --> 16:16.192
I've come very close
to having to take a TV gig.

16:16.279 --> 16:20.196
So, yes, I'm extremely
anxious for this film to work.

16:20.283 --> 16:21.632
I need it to work.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.678
Hanson s' death was
awfully convenient then.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.681
Yeah, it was.
It was.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.770
And when you told me he was
dead, my heart leapt for joy

16:29.858 --> 16:30.946
and then I felt terrible.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.992
And then you felt good again.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.908
Listen, I'm an artist, okay?

16:36.996 --> 16:39.650
I'm arrogant,
I'm dishonest, and I'm childish.

16:39.737 --> 16:42.305
But you know what?
I'm not stupid.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.046
I do not think
I'm above the law.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.267
Gabe. Felicia's
on set, ready to go.

16:47.354 --> 16:48.659
Thanks, Mitch, you
incompetent weasel.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.835
- Wait a minute.
- Lady, I have a movie to shoot.

16:50.922 --> 16:54.491
And we've got a narcotics
charge we can't ignore.

16:54.578 --> 16:55.971
Those aren't my drugs.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.408
Those are Mitch's drugs.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.323
Right, right.
That's not Gabe's drugs.

17:00.410 --> 17:01.803
That's my drugs.
Sorry, Gabe.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.457
I shouldn't have left
them around the trailer.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.633
How dumb is that?

17:05.720 --> 17:06.851
Can I go, ma'am?

17:12.074 --> 17:14.990
- Go win an Oscar, Gabe.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.513
Mitchell Cavanaugh,
you are under arrest.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.645
Oh, Mitch, and I
thought we worked

17:17.732 --> 17:19.516
through your doormat issues.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.301
Tell Cho to
squeeze him a little.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.390
- He knows things.
- No, I don't.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.696
Sure you do, Mitch.

17:25.783 --> 17:28.743
You're not gonna like
getting squeezed by Cho.

17:28.830 --> 17:29.787
[male #2]
'Action.'

17:29.874 --> 17:31.354
Daisy, where are you?

17:31.441 --> 17:32.399
[Sydney]
'I'm home.'

17:32.486 --> 17:34.053
'I'm not feeling so good.'

17:34.140 --> 17:35.967
Oh, but, puddin',
you have to come.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.014
'Why? Why is it so important?'

17:39.101 --> 17:40.059
Line.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.451
Rowan's on his way.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.018
Rowan.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.672
Rowan is on his way.

17:44.759 --> 17:47.240
I called him
and pretended to be you!

17:47.327 --> 17:48.719
Oh, mom.
No, you didn't.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.852
Oh, yes, I did.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.072
I'm sorry, pudd.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.030
[Sydney]
'Rowan's not even
interested in me'

17:55.117 --> 17:59.513
'and I don't want
him anymore anyway.'

17:59.600 --> 18:00.557
I'm sorry.

18:00.644 --> 18:01.645
Sydney, honey.

18:01.732 --> 18:04.126
- Honey.
- Cut!

18:04.213 --> 18:06.302
[Felicia]
'You can't just read
the lines, hon.'

18:06.389 --> 18:07.738
You have to be Daisy.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.697
You have to be her.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.960
I need your
passion here, Sydney.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.223
I'm working alone.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.182
Okay.

18:16.269 --> 18:19.881
Okay. Let's, uh, pick
it up from where we left off.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.056
'Rowan doesn't need me.'

18:21.143 --> 18:23.189
- 'To pickup.'
- 'Rolling.'

18:23.276 --> 18:25.800
- 'Speed.'
- 'Quiet, people.'

18:25.887 --> 18:27.671
- 'Settle please.'
- Action!

18:29.760 --> 18:31.197
Rowan's not interested in me

18:31.284 --> 18:33.634
and I don't want
him anymore anyway.

18:33.721 --> 18:36.985
Oh, honey, don't give up
on your dream so easily.

18:37.072 --> 18:41.032
I know love can be tough,
but it's all we have..

18:41.120 --> 18:42.773
Hello?

18:42.860 --> 18:44.558
'Hello?'

18:44.645 --> 18:47.082
Hello.. Oh, hi, Rowan.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.737
Good morning, Mrs. Atkins.

18:49.824 --> 18:52.522
Daisy's not here.
She's, uh, she's at home.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.045
Oh, that's alright.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.700
It's-it's actually you
that I wanted to speak with.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.049
Oh.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.748
What you said just
now about love..

19:09.670 --> 19:11.498
Ow!

19:11.585 --> 19:12.542
[Gabriel]
'Cut!'

19:12.629 --> 19:14.588
Great. Lovely.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.242
'Okay.'

19:16.329 --> 19:18.157
Okay, everybody,
we're gonna go one more time.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.071
Jeff, baby, don't flinch
before she throws the slap.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.508
'You don't know it's coming.'

19:21.595 --> 19:24.075
She's taking a right old wallop.
I mean, it hurt.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.992
Oh, I'm sorry for feeling
a little emotional today.

19:28.079 --> 19:31.170
'Gabe.. Gabriel, this scene
is still running really flat.'

19:31.257 --> 19:32.736
But I-I have an idea.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.651
- I think I know--
- We're in the master, babe.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.566
Really, really wide and you're
about that big in the frame.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.177
We're gonna fix
it in coverage, okay?

19:38.264 --> 19:39.395
I-I realize that but I think

19:39.482 --> 19:41.049
it's an important establishing..

19:41.136 --> 19:42.703
No, no, Gabriel, please.

19:42.790 --> 19:43.921
This is an establishing
moment for the character.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.401
Die screaming,
you malignant harpy.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.534
I'm sorry.
I missed that, what?

19:47.621 --> 19:48.709
You know what?
Let's take ten, folks.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.101
- 'Okay?'
- Okay.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.407
'Come on, princess, let's talk.'

19:51.494 --> 19:52.713
Please.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.497
You know..

19:54.584 --> 19:56.282
'...I-I know it's..'

19:56.369 --> 19:58.762
[Gabriel]
'No, I understand.'

19:58.849 --> 20:01.330
[instrumental music]

20:16.476 --> 20:18.695
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.523
You're good.
You're a good actor.

20:20.610 --> 20:21.742
Thank you.

20:21.829 --> 20:22.960
Must have been tough when

20:23.047 --> 20:25.224
your dad took up with Felicia..

20:25.311 --> 20:26.399
...replacing your real mother.

20:28.444 --> 20:32.056
My real mom is in an alcoholic
stupor somewhere in New Jersey.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.754
I was happy to see her go.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.321
- Why is it that actors--
- Bye.

20:35.408 --> 20:36.409
Bye.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.019
Alright.

20:49.552 --> 20:52.120
So what do you know, Mitch?

20:52.207 --> 20:53.991
- Nothing.
- Jane says you know stuff.

20:54.078 --> 20:56.777
- And he's always right, is he?
- Pretty much.

20:56.864 --> 20:59.562
So this is one for the books.
That's a first.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.260
I got nothing for you.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.392
Mitchell, unlawful possession
of prescription drugs

21:03.479 --> 21:06.177
puts you in line
for actual prison time.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.092
I doubt that, but, uh,
if you're right, so be it.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.137
'Really? So be it?'

21:09.224 --> 21:10.486
I'm told the pills actually

21:10.573 --> 21:11.792
belong to your client,
Gabe Fanning.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.751
No comment.

21:14.838 --> 21:17.363
You'll go to prison
to protect Fanning?

21:17.450 --> 21:18.799
Hey, how good of
an agent is Mitch Cavanaugh?

21:18.886 --> 21:21.149
Oh, he went to prison
to protect a client.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.325
Sounds, sounds
pretty good to me.

21:23.412 --> 21:25.501
To protect a client,
he became the personal servant

21:25.588 --> 21:26.546
of a large
and violent criminal.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.851
How's that sound?

21:30.027 --> 21:33.117
Look, I'm willing to speak to
you on any subject you care

21:33.204 --> 21:34.684
to mention, but on my life

21:34.771 --> 21:37.992
I don't know who
killed Felix Hanson.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.385
Give me some guidance here.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.256
What-what.. What do
you wanna know about?

21:41.343 --> 21:42.910
Frederick Ross.

21:42.997 --> 21:45.260
Ross? Freddie Ross,
the drug dealer?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.175
What about him?

21:47.262 --> 21:48.611
Do you know where
we can find him?

21:48.698 --> 21:50.004
Maybe.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.266
Give us Ross,
and you're free to go.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.659
Charges expunged.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.315
Deal.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.927
[rock music]

22:28.303 --> 22:30.697
There he is.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.266
I got the hoodie.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.311
Hey!

22:37.878 --> 22:38.879
Hey!

22:38.966 --> 22:40.097
Stop right there!

22:41.621 --> 22:44.058
Gotcha!

22:44.145 --> 22:45.320
Hey, stop!

22:47.670 --> 22:49.759
Sydney Hanson.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.065
Let's go.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.725
Well, it's good to see you
again, in our custody.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.248
How do you know Felix Hanson?

23:00.335 --> 23:02.119
I never met the man in my life.

23:02.206 --> 23:04.078
He called your cellphone
minutes before he was shot.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.514
I was in bed.

23:05.601 --> 23:08.212
- Can anybody attest to that?
- Bruce.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.563
'Where can we find Bruce?'

23:10.650 --> 23:13.392
Probably on my kitchen floor,
chewing on a pig's ear

23:13.479 --> 23:15.959
that I left for him.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.658
What did Hanson
say when he called you?

23:18.745 --> 23:21.312
He told me to stay away
from his little girl.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.792
- You sleeping with her?
- Come on.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.403
What is she, like ten?

23:24.490 --> 23:27.841
- 16.
- Whatever.

23:27.928 --> 23:30.147
I'm not a pervert.

23:30.234 --> 23:31.584
I know her boyfriend.

23:31.671 --> 23:33.716
He's the one
who'd buy from me.

23:33.803 --> 23:36.153
Brandon Fulton.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.242
Little bad boy.

23:38.329 --> 23:41.245
Hanson had 'em both followed.

23:41.332 --> 23:44.161
Shazam!
Lead him right to me.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.207
I really do have to get
a new system going, you know?

23:46.294 --> 23:48.992
Retail drugs is for suckers.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.994
So where's Brandon now?

23:51.081 --> 23:52.822
I don't know.
I mean, we never hung out.

23:52.909 --> 23:55.651
Except for business.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.871
So Hanson found out that Brandon
got Sydney hooked on drugs

23:57.958 --> 24:00.221
and traced the
drugs back to you.

24:00.308 --> 24:01.570
See, we should
write that down

24:01.657 --> 24:03.093
you know,
get a pitch together.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.487
You got a murder,
intrigue, young love.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.010
Yeah, all we need
is an ending.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.838
Hanson wanted
to do you some damage.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.449
If you killed him
protecting yourself

24:10.536 --> 24:12.494
that's self-defense,
justifiable homicide.

24:12.581 --> 24:13.887
Thanks for the tip.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.758
Can I call my lawyer now?

24:15.845 --> 24:17.281
Please?

24:17.368 --> 24:19.283
How long have you
been using drugs, Sydney?

24:19.370 --> 24:20.894
Ha! You sound like my father.

24:20.981 --> 24:22.243
Yeah, well, you father wasn't
gonna throw you

24:22.330 --> 24:23.766
in juvie, was he?

24:23.853 --> 24:25.507
That was your weed
and your pills we found

24:25.594 --> 24:26.769
in the car, wasn't it?

24:26.856 --> 24:29.598
You're the man.
You figure it out.

24:29.685 --> 24:30.991
It must have made
you pretty mad when

24:31.078 --> 24:32.906
your dad took
your drugs away from you.

24:32.993 --> 24:34.821
Yeah, well, it's not
the first time it happened

24:34.908 --> 24:36.170
and I can always get more.

24:36.257 --> 24:38.781
- From Freddie Ross?
- From whoever.

24:40.609 --> 24:41.871
[Patrick]
'Where'd you meet Freddie?'

24:41.958 --> 24:43.351
I don't know, around.

24:43.438 --> 24:45.222
Freddie says
Brandon Fulton hooked you up.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.398
Brandon's not like
people say he is.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.881
Brandon Fulton, actor,
19-years-old

24:51.968 --> 24:53.753
nine prior arrests.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.756
DUI, drug possession,
disorderly conduct.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.453
Shall I go on?

24:58.540 --> 25:00.281
Why do women love
bad boys so much?

25:00.368 --> 25:02.065
I don't get it.
Why do they love 'em?

25:02.152 --> 25:03.414
What do you think, Sydney?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.155
- Can I go now?
- In a minute.

25:05.242 --> 25:06.940
Your parents forbade
you from seeing Brandon.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.637
That's why you didn't want
your mom to see the picture.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.684
- Yes.
- Why didn't she like him?

25:11.771 --> 25:13.424
You know, they said
he was a bad influence.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.036
Did he make you do something?

25:19.474 --> 25:22.433
We needed some cash, so I
took some stuff from the house.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.479
- Like what?
- Like stuff.

25:24.566 --> 25:28.178
- Money, some old gun, pills.
- Gun?

25:28.265 --> 25:29.832
- What kind of gun?
- I don't know.

25:29.919 --> 25:33.314
A gun, and Brandon
sold it for cash.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.446
Your parents stopped
you seeing your prince.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.013
- That make you mad?
- Of course.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.362
So you just kept
on seeing him?

25:38.449 --> 25:42.149
- No. No, I have not seen him.
- Oh.

25:42.236 --> 25:45.195
Phone records say he's been
calling your house regularly.

25:45.282 --> 25:47.284
Well, that's not..

25:47.371 --> 25:50.331
That's.. I don't..
I-I don't know. Whatever.

25:50.418 --> 25:51.462
Where's he now?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.508
I don't know where he is.

26:01.298 --> 26:03.387
You know, Brandon's
not a bad kid.

26:03.474 --> 26:06.739
He's just too old,
and way too wild for Sydney.

26:06.826 --> 26:08.915
She said she stole a gun,
along with some other things

26:09.002 --> 26:10.699
from the house.

26:10.786 --> 26:14.398
Yeah, it was some old army thing
that Felix liked to keep around.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.098
What caliber?

26:18.185 --> 26:19.578
.45 I believe.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.101
Please sit down.

26:21.188 --> 26:23.494
You didn't report the theft?

26:23.582 --> 26:27.194
No, it was a foolish
girl's mistake.

26:27.281 --> 26:28.978
Your husband was
murdered with a .45.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.939
No, that-that's a coincidence.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.550
Sydney loved her father.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.596
No.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.075
- No.
- What about Brandon?

26:39.162 --> 26:40.120
He's a mixed up kid.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.556
There's no malice in him.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.387
You knew the drugs in Felix's
car were Sydney's all along.

26:49.259 --> 26:50.434
Yes.

26:51.697 --> 26:52.654
You're good.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.917
She.. Wow.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.441
Felix found the drugs
a few days ago.

26:57.528 --> 27:00.923
He was heartbroken because
she had promised to stop.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.970
So he held on to them
while we debated what to do.

27:04.057 --> 27:07.538
And now that Felix is gone,
what are you gonna do?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.236
Forgive her.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.151
Show her love.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.935
We all make mistakes,
but we have the power

27:13.022 --> 27:15.503
to give ourselves
a second chance.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.027
Do you know if
Sydney and Brandon

27:18.114 --> 27:20.160
were still seeing each other?

27:20.247 --> 27:21.901
- Did you ask her?
- I did.

27:21.988 --> 27:24.555
She said she hadn't seen
him since you banned him.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.601
Then I believe her.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.647
He has been calling
this house regularly.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.433
Oh, God, Sydney..

27:34.087 --> 27:35.479
Brandon dropped
out of sight after

27:35.566 --> 27:38.308
the murder of your husband.

27:38.395 --> 27:41.311
No. I.. I refuse to believe it.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.574
I-I refuse.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.186
I need to see Sydney.

27:46.273 --> 27:48.623
- When can she come home?
- She's on her way.

27:48.710 --> 27:51.321
There's no charges
regarding the drug offence.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.193
Oh, God.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.805
Thank you so much for your
kindness and your understanding.

27:56.892 --> 27:57.980
Thank you.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.505
That's okay.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.682
There's a lot of leeway
in juvenile cases.

28:05.901 --> 28:08.295
I'll always be very grateful.

28:14.257 --> 28:17.826
Ooh, she was some woman to make
the mighty agent Lisbon

28:17.913 --> 28:19.045
blush like a schoolgirl.

28:19.132 --> 28:20.133
Please.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.569
I did not.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.223
- You know what I predict?
- Nope.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.659
- Guess.
- Oh, just tell me.

28:24.746 --> 28:27.270
No, I think you should guess.
It's good for you.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.837
I predict that Brandon Fulton

28:28.924 --> 28:30.926
will pay a visit to the Hanson
residence this evening.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.841
You think?
Wouldn't be too clever of him.

28:32.928 --> 28:35.148
Love is not blind.
It's often pretty stupid.

28:35.235 --> 28:37.628
I'll arrange a stakeout.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.941
Oh, yeah. When I'm super rich,
I'm gonna live here.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.075
Can't beat the sound
of the waves, huh?

28:49.162 --> 28:51.425
They've got gadgets
that'll do that for ya.

28:51.512 --> 28:54.384
The sound of waves on the beach,
jungle sounds, roaring fire.

28:54.471 --> 28:55.690
Yeah, well,
it's not quite the real

28:55.777 --> 28:56.735
live Pacific Ocean
though, is it?

28:56.822 --> 28:57.997
Nah, It's cheaper.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.607
In the event you
don't become super rich.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.304
Oh, I'll be rich.
I'll be.. I'll be super rich.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.611
I know.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.404
Oh, crap.

Drop the gun down!

30:03.671 --> 30:05.499
Get back.

30:05.586 --> 30:06.587
Have I killed him?

30:08.154 --> 30:10.983
Oh, God! Is he dead?
Have I killed him?

30:11.070 --> 30:12.636
This is agent Cho, CBI.

30:12.723 --> 30:15.901
We need paramedics at 4-3-5-6-5,
Trancas Beach Road.

30:15.988 --> 30:17.424
We got a juvie male with
a gunshot wound to the abdomen.

30:17.511 --> 30:19.382
Oh!

30:19.469 --> 30:22.429
I just panicked. I-I just saw..
I saw the gun and I panicked.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.997
I just panicked.
Is he gonna be okay?

30:25.084 --> 30:27.738
- Hey, .45.
- Nice.

30:27.826 --> 30:28.870
Is he okay?

30:28.957 --> 30:30.263
Hope so.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.047
What happened? Oh, my God!

30:32.134 --> 30:33.396
- No, no, no.
- Brandon! Please.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.007
- Come on. No, no.
- Please, please.

30:35.094 --> 30:37.400
- He's alright, he's alright.
- Please, please.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.838
- What..
- Hey, boss. Yeah.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.579
We got a good news,
bad news situation here.

30:42.666 --> 30:44.712
[crying]

30:50.457 --> 30:52.111
Now there are no guarantees

30:52.198 --> 30:54.504
but as of now, there won't be
any charges pressed against you

30:54.591 --> 30:56.419
for shooting Brandon.

30:56.506 --> 31:00.510
Oh! Oh, thank goodness for that.

31:00.597 --> 31:04.427
- Is he gonna be alright?
- Yeah, he'll be fine.

31:04.514 --> 31:08.170
Well, that's a relief.

31:08.257 --> 31:09.824
I mean, I feel terrible.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.565
But what was he thinking
sneaking around

31:11.652 --> 31:14.481
our house with a gun?

31:14.568 --> 31:16.483
'What does he say he was doing?'

31:16.570 --> 31:17.919
He's still recovering
from surgery.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.486
We're gonna talk to
him as soon as we can.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.270
Okay.

31:21.357 --> 31:23.533
The gun he was carrying was the
gun that killed your husband.

31:23.620 --> 31:26.145
It's the gun Sydney
stole from your house.

31:29.278 --> 31:31.498
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.500
Sydney may be
an accessory to murder.

31:36.329 --> 31:37.939
[sighs]

31:45.686 --> 31:47.166
Why were you there
last night, Brandon?

31:47.253 --> 31:48.950
What were you
planning on doing?

31:49.037 --> 31:51.910
Before you Nazis shot me?
I was visiting my girlfriend.

31:51.997 --> 31:55.130
- We didn't shoot you.
- Yeah, tell that to the judge.

31:55.217 --> 31:56.871
I'm suing your ass, big time.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.004
Yeah, okay, that's a plan.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.483
Here's your problem, Brandon.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.050
The gun that you were
carrying last night

32:02.137 --> 32:03.834
was the same gun used
to kill Felix Hanson.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.619
The gun that Sydney
stole for you

32:05.706 --> 32:09.623
which puts you both in
a whole lot of trouble.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.320
I have nothing to
say about that.

32:11.407 --> 32:14.323
- Did Sydney know?
- Did she know what?

32:14.410 --> 32:16.543
Did she know you were gonna
use the gun to kill her father?

32:16.630 --> 32:18.632
I didn't.

32:18.719 --> 32:20.851
Did she ask you to do it?

32:20.939 --> 32:22.505
- I didn't kill him.
- We know you killed him.

32:22.592 --> 32:24.029
That ship has sailed.

32:24.116 --> 32:26.553
We're charging you with
the murder of Felix Hanson.

32:26.640 --> 32:30.383
We just want to know
if Sydney's involved.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.821
You people have no
idea who he really was.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.866
He was a monster,
a total sadist.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.172
- A sadist?
- Whatever, man.

32:37.259 --> 32:38.782
He liked to hurt people.

32:38.869 --> 32:41.263
'And that would be a good
reason to kill a man.'

32:41.350 --> 32:42.569
If he was hurting
someone that you love.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.310
Yeah, any man
would do the same.

32:44.397 --> 32:47.443
Did he hurt Sydney?
Is that what she told you?

32:47.530 --> 32:49.706
Did she persuade you
that he needed to die?

32:49.793 --> 32:51.056
To protect her?

32:55.321 --> 32:57.714
I'm saying nothing.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.499
I want my lawyer.

32:59.586 --> 33:00.543
[grunts]

33:03.720 --> 33:05.505
[indistinct chattering]

33:08.551 --> 33:11.076
Hey, boss. He's lawyered
up and admitting nothing.

33:11.163 --> 33:13.121
Tough to get a conviction
with what we have so far.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.688
But we have the murder weapon,
we don't need a confession.

33:14.775 --> 33:16.733
Yeah, the gun's a double-edged
sword kind of.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.474
Belonged to Felix Hanson,
was never reported stolen.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.259
And we recovered it
in Hanson's house.

33:20.346 --> 33:21.825
- From Brandon.
- Or from the floor.

33:21.912 --> 33:23.349
We never saw it in
Brandon's possession.

33:23.436 --> 33:24.741
And there's no
recoverable prints.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.395
In a courtroom, we can't
put Hanson and the gun

33:26.482 --> 33:28.223
and Brandon together
in the same place.

33:28.310 --> 33:31.096
So without an actual confession
from Brandon, we're stuck.

33:31.183 --> 33:32.967
Or a confession from Sydney.

33:33.054 --> 33:36.318
There's no way that Brandon did
this without her say so, right?

33:36.405 --> 33:39.191
That, my dear,
is an excellent question.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.020
[dramatic music]

33:44.109 --> 33:46.415
- Is Brandon gonna be okay?
- He'll live.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.722
I wanna see him.
I need to talk to him.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.419
And, uh, what would
you say to him?

33:50.506 --> 33:52.726
That's not your business.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.249
I think I know what
happened here, Sydney.

33:54.336 --> 33:55.772
I'm wondering if you do too.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.600
'Uh, yeah.'

33:57.687 --> 33:59.776
'My boyfriend shot my dad'

33:59.863 --> 34:01.561
and then my stepmom
shot my boyfriend.

34:01.648 --> 34:03.258
My life is like a sick joke.

34:03.345 --> 34:04.868
So tell me, Sydney, why
would Brandon kill your dad

34:04.955 --> 34:07.784
unless you wanted him to,
unless you asked him to?

34:10.526 --> 34:12.572
I didn't ask him to do anything.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.574
Can you look at me and say that?

34:17.272 --> 34:20.623
I didn't ask him to do anything.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.495
I loved my father.

34:22.582 --> 34:24.236
I did.

34:24.323 --> 34:25.672
Maybe someone else
made him do it.

34:25.759 --> 34:26.760
Who?

34:28.762 --> 34:30.416
You tell me.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.377
[indistinct chattering]

34:48.782 --> 34:50.000
[sighs]

34:51.611 --> 34:53.743
[instrumental music]

34:59.532 --> 35:01.490
What are you thinking?

35:01.577 --> 35:04.319
I'm thinking Felicia and Sydney
should go back to work.

35:04.406 --> 35:05.929
Oh, really? Why so?

35:07.670 --> 35:10.151
A great man once said,
all the world's a stage

35:10.238 --> 35:12.197
and all the men and
women merely players.

35:12.284 --> 35:13.459
Oh, really?

35:13.546 --> 35:15.504
- Really.
- Oh.

35:17.289 --> 35:18.594
Ladies.

35:18.681 --> 35:21.075
Good morning. How are you?

35:21.162 --> 35:22.946
- Mmm, fine.
- Okay.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.905
Listen, I was thinking
before we roll

35:24.992 --> 35:26.689
why don't we just run through
the whole thing from the top

35:26.776 --> 35:29.997
for fun, okay? Don't worry
about being on page too much.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.521
Just use your instincts, and
let's see what happens, okay?

35:32.608 --> 35:34.088
- 'Okay.'
- Alrighty.

35:34.175 --> 35:35.785
Shoot it.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.483
[male #3]
Alright, everybody..

35:40.181 --> 35:41.530
Okay!

35:41.617 --> 35:43.532
'Let's see how this goes.'

35:43.619 --> 35:45.708
'And..'

35:45.795 --> 35:46.796
Action.

35:46.883 --> 35:48.798
'Daisy, where are you?'

35:48.885 --> 35:50.148
[Sydney]
'I'm right here, mom.'

35:52.237 --> 35:53.238
[sighs]

35:53.325 --> 35:56.545
Look at you. You look...good.

35:56.632 --> 35:59.374
[Sydney]
'Thanks. What were you
calling me about?'

35:59.461 --> 36:01.768
I just wanted to make
sure you were on your way.

36:01.855 --> 36:04.814
Why is it important I be here?

36:04.901 --> 36:06.990
I did a naughty thing.

36:07.077 --> 36:10.080
I called Rowan. He's on his way.
I pretended to be you.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.344
- Oh, no, you didn't.
- Oh, yes, I did.

36:12.431 --> 36:15.521
- I'm sorry, bunny.
- Why would you do that?

36:15.608 --> 36:19.829
Why play games? You've already
seduced him away from me.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.396
I did not.

36:21.483 --> 36:23.877
- 'Why would you say that?'
- Stop acting!

36:23.964 --> 36:25.313
It's over.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.097
I know what you did.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.056
I know who you are.

36:29.143 --> 36:30.492
'You've always hated me.'

36:30.579 --> 36:32.755
You seduced Brandon,
and you lied to him

36:32.842 --> 36:35.018
and you made him kill my father!

36:35.105 --> 36:37.238
- I, uh, Gabe.
- No, you're not going anywhere.

36:37.325 --> 36:39.458
Gabe, cut it.
She's gone mad.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.634
[Sydney]
'I'll let you go after you
tell them it's not true.'

36:41.721 --> 36:43.375
'Tell them I'm wrong.
Tell them!'

36:44.898 --> 36:45.986
I..

36:46.073 --> 36:47.553
It's not true, it's..

36:47.640 --> 36:49.772
'Uh..'

36:49.859 --> 36:51.644
No, it'snot.

36:51.731 --> 36:54.734
- It's-it's not. It's not true.
- God, you're such a liar.

36:54.821 --> 36:56.649
This is ridiculous.

36:56.736 --> 36:59.652
I don't know what
he said to you..

36:59.739 --> 37:02.394
...but it's nonsense.

37:02.481 --> 37:05.397
This is upsetting
to me and unfair.

37:05.484 --> 37:08.704
Sydney, terrific. Just terrific.
You, uh, I'm not buying it.

37:08.791 --> 37:11.272
You're wooden, high-pitched
believe it, Felicia.

37:11.359 --> 37:13.883
Believe it,
and then we will. Okay?

37:13.970 --> 37:17.757
Let's try one more from,
uh, "This is ridiculous."

37:17.844 --> 37:19.454
This is..

37:19.541 --> 37:22.109
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

37:22.196 --> 37:25.025
It's easy to understand.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.157
You told Brandon
that Felix was abusing you.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.638
You persuaded Brandon
to kill Felix.

37:29.725 --> 37:32.250
When you feared he'd
confess to the police

37:32.337 --> 37:34.948
you lured him to the house,
planning to kill him as well.

37:35.035 --> 37:36.515
But now Sydney sees the truth.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.518
She knows that you're
a conniving, murderous bitch.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.433
Way too melodramatic.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.130
Your whole world
is falling apart.

37:43.217 --> 37:44.610
You're done unless you can

37:44.697 --> 37:47.265
convince us that you
are telling the truth now.

37:50.137 --> 37:53.140
My.. My work is always truthful.

37:53.227 --> 37:54.184
Uh.

37:55.969 --> 37:57.623
There's a little afternoon
soap in there.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.974
Oh..

38:01.061 --> 38:02.845
That's a terrible thing to say.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.198
Tell us the truth, Felicia.

38:08.851 --> 38:10.200
[sighs]

38:10.288 --> 38:12.638
Make it real.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.030
You can do it.

38:15.467 --> 38:16.685
[gasps]
Mmm.

38:23.692 --> 38:26.042
[dramatic music]

38:37.358 --> 38:40.013
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.623
What was that? Speak up.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.981
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.857
I-I was angry.

39:00.860 --> 39:04.124
[Felicia]
He changed his mind over
script issues he said.

39:04.211 --> 39:06.474
He didn't want me out
there being successful

39:06.561 --> 39:08.781
having other men look
at me and want me.

39:08.868 --> 39:11.261
It made him feel insecure.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.439
I gave up my life
to be with him.

39:14.526 --> 39:18.399
This is my life, and he
wouldn't let me have it back.

39:18.486 --> 39:21.968
He was suffocating me.

39:22.055 --> 39:23.752
It was a form of abuse.

39:40.508 --> 39:43.555
Hey. Is Sydney here?

39:43.642 --> 39:46.340
No, she's out.

39:46.427 --> 39:49.996
[Felicia]
Brandon came along
a-at a weak moment.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.998
Why don't you come
and sit down with me?

39:55.218 --> 39:57.046
He forced himself on me.

40:02.312 --> 40:03.357
[sighs]

40:04.227 --> 40:05.620
I let him.

40:05.707 --> 40:07.405
[whispering]

40:09.798 --> 40:13.323
He told Felix that Sydney
was in trouble.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.760
Felix went right along.

40:17.937 --> 40:20.243
It's Sydney. She's back
here, and she needs you.

40:23.246 --> 40:24.291
Sydney!

40:25.945 --> 40:27.425
'Sydney!'

40:29.731 --> 40:32.430
What's going on here, Brandon?

40:32.517 --> 40:34.127
You sick bastard.

40:34.214 --> 40:35.433
[gunfire]

40:45.443 --> 40:47.445
[Felicia]
'He did love
that daughter of his.'

40:47.532 --> 40:49.795
'I'll give him that.'

40:49.882 --> 40:52.798
If only he could have
accepted me for who I am.

40:55.017 --> 40:58.717
Respected my needs.

40:58.804 --> 41:00.849
This would never have happened.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.721
Men are beasts.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.593
[sighs]

41:07.813 --> 41:09.989
Patrick, would you
do me a favor?

41:10.076 --> 41:11.991
Oh, I might.

41:15.429 --> 41:17.475
Tell Sydney that I'm sorry.

41:19.302 --> 41:22.349
I see now on reflection..

41:22.436 --> 41:24.482
...I wasn't the stepmother
I might've been.

41:26.527 --> 41:28.224
I'm sorry for that.

41:31.358 --> 41:33.055
I did try.

41:36.189 --> 41:39.018
And I hope and pray that she
doesn't become bitter.

Hope that she finds happiness.

41:43.196 --> 41:45.111

41:48.244 --> 41:50.986

41:52.684 --> 41:53.902
Or you will lose it.

41:56.557 --> 41:57.732
That's true.

42:00.169 --> 42:01.519
That's true.

42:16.185 --> 42:17.447
