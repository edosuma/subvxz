WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:03.293
Oh, my god.

00:03.328 --> 00:05.162
Gabi, guess what i got
from table six?

00:05.197 --> 00:08.065
A hundred dollar tip.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.482
Oh, you gotta give it back.

00:09.535 --> 00:11.034
Mr. Schwartz is senile.

00:11.070 --> 00:12.452
Oh, okay.
Well, i'll give it back to him

00:12.538 --> 00:14.037
As soon as he gets out
of the ladies' room.

00:15.541 --> 00:17.391
Gabi, thank you so much

00:17.476 --> 00:19.276
For getting me
this waitressing job.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.443
With this and soul spin,

00:20.479 --> 00:23.113
I finally make enough money
to have to pay taxes.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.331
Aww!

00:24.366 --> 00:26.216
You're welcome.
You know, i don't know why

00:26.251 --> 00:27.250
They say friends
shouldn't work together.

00:27.286 --> 00:29.086
This week has been
so much fun.

00:29.121 --> 00:30.120
Right?

00:30.172 --> 00:32.155
I think it's made us
even closer.

00:32.191 --> 00:34.458
Out! Get out!

00:34.493 --> 00:36.426
You're a deadbeat!

00:36.462 --> 00:38.495
Mr. Fancy,
what happened
to gary?

00:38.530 --> 00:40.563
let's just say
all that green stuff

00:40.598 --> 00:43.433
In his backpack,
not oregano.

00:44.536 --> 00:45.469
I fired him.

00:46.522 --> 00:48.338
I'm gonna need
a new manager.

00:48.374 --> 00:51.241
Comes with more power,
more responsibility,

00:51.276 --> 00:52.409
And more pay.

00:52.444 --> 00:54.244
Anyone interested?

00:54.279 --> 00:55.245
I am!

01:18.220 --> 01:19.186
What are you doing?

01:19.221 --> 01:20.303
Uh, what do you mean
what am i doing?

01:20.338 --> 01:22.138
I'm movin' on up.
What are you doing?

01:22.191 --> 01:23.390
I'm movin' on up.

01:23.442 --> 01:26.142
You can't have
that manager job.
It's mine.

01:26.195 --> 01:29.196
Is it? 'cause, uh,
how do i say this nicely?

01:29.231 --> 01:32.366
Um, i'm so much more
qualified than you.

01:32.401 --> 01:34.368
Uh, how are you more
qualified than me?

01:34.403 --> 01:36.236
You've been here a week.

01:37.355 --> 01:38.372
Oh, you're serious.

01:40.209 --> 01:42.242
Gabi, i managed
my dad's store,

01:42.294 --> 01:44.211
I went to college,
i can do math.

01:45.381 --> 01:46.380
I can do math.

01:48.217 --> 01:50.133
Eight plus fifteen--
yes, that's math!

01:51.253 --> 01:53.253
Gabi, you're not a manager.

01:53.305 --> 01:54.337
You're a cook.

01:54.372 --> 01:56.306
Okay, first of all, "chef".

01:58.209 --> 02:00.143
Second of all, one day,
i'm going to have

02:00.178 --> 02:01.311
My own restaurant
where i'm going to be manager,

02:01.346 --> 02:04.347
So i need to know
manager-y stuff.

02:04.383 --> 02:08.184
Okay, name three things
a manager does.

02:08.237 --> 02:10.287
Makes. More. Money.

02:12.324 --> 02:14.157
Now, girls, uh,

02:14.192 --> 02:15.325
I've made my decision.

02:16.394 --> 02:19.162
Sofia, you're terrific.

02:19.197 --> 02:21.197
Thank you, mr. Fancy.
It's such an honor to accept--

02:21.250 --> 02:22.249
Yeah, i'm going with gabi.

02:22.284 --> 02:23.366
What?
Yes!

02:23.401 --> 02:26.253
But i'm experienced
and educated

02:26.288 --> 02:27.370
And have great work ethic.

02:27.405 --> 02:29.172
But she has great cans.

02:30.242 --> 02:31.374
You can't hire her for that.

02:31.409 --> 02:34.344
Sorry, i forgot
this was not 1970.

02:35.431 --> 02:38.265
Okay, how about, uh,
she's been here longer

02:38.300 --> 02:40.216
And, uh, she's got seniority.

02:40.251 --> 02:42.269
Oh, thank you, mr. Fancy.

02:42.304 --> 02:44.187
You made the right decision.

02:45.256 --> 02:47.190
Good. You'll start right now.

02:47.225 --> 02:48.308
I need supplies ordered

02:48.360 --> 02:51.278
And i need the till to be
balanced by closing.

02:51.313 --> 02:53.196
And if you screw it up,

02:53.231 --> 02:55.198
I'm giving it to shakira here.

02:56.452 --> 02:59.235
Don't you worry, mr. Fancy.

02:59.288 --> 03:01.204
That till will be balanced.

03:02.324 --> 03:04.291
Do you even know
what a till is?

03:04.326 --> 03:06.092
No.

03:06.178 --> 03:07.194
But i don't have to
worry about that

03:07.279 --> 03:08.545
"till" closing.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.470
Yolanda,

03:16.555 --> 03:18.288
I need help.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.257
What do you want
from the top shelf,

03:20.292 --> 03:21.341
Cookies or crackers?

03:24.296 --> 03:25.562
Neither.

03:25.597 --> 03:28.098
You know how alan and i are
applying to be foster parents?

03:28.133 --> 03:30.116
I am so proud
of you guys.

03:30.151 --> 03:33.053
And if it's a boy,
you can wear his hand-me-downs.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.206
There was a question

03:36.241 --> 03:38.108
About what we like
to do outdoors,

03:38.143 --> 03:40.143
And before i could answer,
"umbrella drinks,"

03:40.179 --> 03:43.063
Alan wrote down camping.

03:43.148 --> 03:45.415
Alan camps?
I know.

03:45.450 --> 03:48.284
Orange vest,
camo combat boots.

03:48.337 --> 03:49.452
We're gay,
not lesbians.

03:52.424 --> 03:55.258
But apparently,
he used to go camping

03:55.294 --> 03:57.260
With his temple,
and now he wants me to go,

03:57.296 --> 03:59.095
And i don't want to.

04:00.164 --> 04:01.131
Why not?

04:01.166 --> 04:02.482
Ooh, it's so much fun.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.034
You're outside--

04:04.069 --> 04:05.134
Pass.

04:05.187 --> 04:07.370
In the fresh air--
overrated.

04:08.507 --> 04:09.439
Okay, elliot, what's the deal?

04:11.109 --> 04:12.309
All right, i'm afraid!

04:12.344 --> 04:14.244
Of what?

04:14.279 --> 04:16.413
Animals, bugs,
white men with guns.

04:18.317 --> 04:19.249
That last part i get.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.205
So, you know what?
Just be honest with alan.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.322
I can't.

04:26.375 --> 04:30.160
He sees me as
strong and rugged.

04:32.531 --> 04:35.065
But you're doughy and weak.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.150
Oh, come on.

04:37.185 --> 04:38.535
Stop being a baby.
Even i go camping.

04:39.588 --> 04:43.373
Yolanda, you can
teach me to camp.

04:44.443 --> 04:45.492
Hm.

04:45.527 --> 04:47.344
Might as well.

04:47.379 --> 04:48.411
It's either that
or clubbing.

04:50.382 --> 04:53.149
Either way, i end up
waking up outside.

05:06.564 --> 05:08.431
Well, ms. Manager,

05:08.466 --> 05:10.483
This is the last receipt
of the day.

05:10.535 --> 05:13.336
I guess it's time
for you to balance the till.

05:13.371 --> 05:14.354
Oh, i'm way ahead of you.

05:14.389 --> 05:16.239
I was just waiting for this.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.307
Yoink. Thank you.

05:17.342 --> 05:19.342
Now i can get started.
Good night.

05:19.394 --> 05:21.311
Oh, actually,
if you don't mind,

05:21.346 --> 05:23.296
I was just gonna grab
myself a fountain drink

05:23.331 --> 05:26.049
And watch the master at work.

05:26.084 --> 05:27.217
Great. Wonderful.

05:27.252 --> 05:28.218
Love the company.

05:30.272 --> 05:32.155
Okay, here is the money...

05:33.591 --> 05:35.392
Here are the receipts...

05:38.563 --> 05:40.363
Same height.

05:40.399 --> 05:41.398
Balanced.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.451
Okay, so should i just
take over as manager now

05:45.504 --> 05:47.203
Or when you get fired tomorrow?

05:47.239 --> 05:49.205
fired?

05:49.257 --> 05:51.274
Girls with cans like these
never get canned.

05:54.313 --> 05:56.079
Now leave.

05:56.114 --> 05:59.049
Fine, but don't come crying
to me when you need help.

05:59.084 --> 06:00.183
Oh, i won't.
I don't need your help.

06:00.218 --> 06:02.018
I don't need anyone's help.

06:06.091 --> 06:07.357
Josh, i need your help.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.200
Okay, i think we got
everything we need.

06:17.235 --> 06:18.268
Are you ready, student?

06:18.303 --> 06:19.269
Ready, teach'.

06:20.372 --> 06:22.138
You know, you wouldn't be
the first teacher

06:22.174 --> 06:23.473
I've had a drunken hookup with.

06:25.577 --> 06:27.043
Okay, i-- i'm ready.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.145
Great.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.496
I thought we'd first start off
with a basic lesson

06:30.549 --> 06:32.399
In the macro versus
the microeconomic principles

06:32.484 --> 06:34.084
Of a small business.

06:34.119 --> 06:35.502
<i>i can't believe sofia thought</i>

06:35.537 --> 06:37.053
<i>I couldn't handle this job.</i>

06:37.105 --> 06:39.372
<i>Everyone knows part of being</i>
<i>a good manager is</i>

06:39.407 --> 06:40.490
<i>Figuring out how to</i>
<i>get other people to do</i>

06:40.525 --> 06:43.293
<i>Your work for you.</i>

06:43.328 --> 06:45.362
So, that's how buying in bulk
helps you trim some of the fat,

06:45.397 --> 06:47.280
Which is an essential
principle of...

06:47.315 --> 06:49.165
<i>Speaking of trimming the fat,</i>

06:49.217 --> 06:51.234
<i>Josh sure got rid</i>
<i>of those extra l-b's.</i>

06:51.269 --> 06:53.203
<i>Those new jeans</i>
<i>look extra good.</i>

06:53.238 --> 06:55.254
The monetary
and the fiscal measures

06:55.307 --> 06:58.141
Used by john maynard keynes
are exemplified, mm,

06:58.176 --> 06:59.509
Here in this pie chart.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.444
<i>Mmm, pie.</i>

07:01.480 --> 07:04.014
<i>Ooh, maybe we should sell</i>
<i>whole pies at the diner</i>

07:04.049 --> 07:05.348
<i>And not just slices.</i>

07:05.384 --> 07:07.350
<i>I'm gonna write that down.</i>

07:07.386 --> 07:09.319
All right, got it?

07:09.354 --> 07:10.320
Got it.

07:10.355 --> 07:12.305
Well, now that
the foundation is laid,

07:12.340 --> 07:15.158
I think you are ready to learn
how to balance the till.

07:15.193 --> 07:17.227
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

07:17.262 --> 07:20.129
Actually, i'm more
of a visual learner,

07:20.164 --> 07:23.066
So i think that i would learn
by watching you do it first.

07:29.541 --> 07:32.008
Oh, uh, gabi,
before i leave,

07:32.044 --> 07:33.476
I need to talk to you
about the till.

07:33.511 --> 07:34.411
Here we go.

07:34.446 --> 07:36.496
Oh, uh, was there a problem?

07:36.548 --> 07:37.514
Not a one.

07:37.549 --> 07:39.349
You did a fantastic job

07:39.384 --> 07:41.250
With the receipts
and the inventory.

07:41.303 --> 07:42.318
It was perfect.
What?

07:44.256 --> 07:45.338
Gabi, you've taught
me something.

07:45.373 --> 07:48.224
That a dingy broad
can do a man's job.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.127
Good night.
Wait, wait, wait.
Uh, mr. Fancy,

07:51.163 --> 07:54.147
Actually, in addition
to doing such a great job,

07:54.199 --> 07:56.165
I also found a way
for us to save money.

07:56.218 --> 07:57.517
Oh.
What?

07:57.552 --> 08:00.003
Mm-hmm. See, uh, i noticed
how much bacon we use,

08:00.038 --> 08:03.356
So i ordered 250 pounds
of it in bulk

08:03.391 --> 08:04.490
Because it's 20% cheaper.

08:04.543 --> 08:06.976
Wow, that's great!

08:07.012 --> 08:08.278
I love a cheap woman.

08:11.382 --> 08:13.399
Well, i hope you bought
toilet paper in bulk,

08:13.452 --> 08:16.119
'cause you're full of it.
Oh, please.

08:16.154 --> 08:18.321
Well, at least i didn't get
the job because of my breasts.

08:18.356 --> 08:20.223
Yeah. You'd be under-qualified.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.529
I have an order
for gabi diamond.

08:26.564 --> 08:28.131
Yeah, that's me.
Sign here and it's all yours.

08:34.539 --> 08:36.106
What the hell is this?

08:36.141 --> 08:37.340
The farm fresh pork you ordered.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.359
No, no.
Too fresh. Too fresh!

08:39.444 --> 08:41.411
I didn't order
an entire freaking pig.

08:41.446 --> 08:43.346
I ordered...

08:43.381 --> 08:44.314
bacon.

08:45.367 --> 08:47.300
Not according to this invoice.

08:47.335 --> 08:48.384
Bye now.
No, no, no. No, no, no.

08:48.419 --> 08:50.153
You gotta--
you gotta take it back.

08:50.205 --> 08:51.221
You gotta go put it back
on the truck.

08:51.256 --> 08:53.189
Sorry. Call the number
on the invoice.

08:53.225 --> 08:55.041
Somebody will
pick it up tomorrow.

08:55.127 --> 08:57.060
No, no! But nobody can
know what i did!

08:57.095 --> 08:59.112
Don't worry,
i won't tell your manager.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.363
I am the manager.

09:01.466 --> 09:03.432
Seriously?
I know.

09:03.467 --> 09:05.368
I was just trying to save 20%!

09:05.420 --> 09:07.053
Math always gets me in trouble.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.014
You know what, yolanda?

09:18.049 --> 09:20.149
Being in the great outdoors
isn't scary at all.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.085
What did i tell ya?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.920
<i></i>

09:23.955 --> 09:25.021
Is it time for marshmallows?

09:25.056 --> 09:26.789
Oh, you know it!

09:30.912 --> 09:32.762
This is just like being
in the real forest.

09:33.848 --> 09:35.748
Moonlight,

09:35.834 --> 09:37.767
Babbling brook,
<i> </i>

09:37.802 --> 09:39.736
Bigfoot.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.177
Josh? I need your help again.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.048
He'll totally help us.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.117
You know, we used to date,
but now we're friends.

09:54.152 --> 09:55.835
It's kind of a long story.

09:58.089 --> 10:00.857
Okay, he's not home
or he's sleeping.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.792
Too bad i still don't work here
and have a key.

10:02.827 --> 10:03.927
you're right,

10:03.962 --> 10:05.812
It was a good idea
to keep it.

10:08.917 --> 10:09.933
Okay.

10:09.968 --> 10:13.152
Now i just have to figure out
where to put you.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.306
I think that you're gonna be
the most comfortable--

10:17.341 --> 10:19.125
Oh, well, wherever
it is you're going.

10:26.918 --> 10:27.917
josh!

10:30.071 --> 10:31.888
Oh, good,
you're awake.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.858
Listen, i have
a little favor
to ask you.

10:35.893 --> 10:36.893
Um, do you remember
when you asked me

10:36.928 --> 10:38.227
To order in bulk
for the restaurant?

10:38.263 --> 10:40.163
Well, i did,
and there was
a little mix up,

10:40.198 --> 10:41.197
And now i have a pig.

10:42.300 --> 10:45.101
Hey! Let me tell it.

10:45.136 --> 10:46.218
See, i can't take it
to my apartment

10:46.271 --> 10:48.121
Because i can't let
sofia know what i did,

10:48.156 --> 10:50.106
So i gotta leave it
here overnight.

10:50.141 --> 10:52.108
But i promise i'll be back
tomorrow to pick it up.

10:52.143 --> 10:53.977
Is that okay?

10:55.146 --> 10:57.847
Mm!
Oh, thank you!

10:57.882 --> 10:59.849
See? Told you he was nice.

11:01.820 --> 11:03.886
Okay, so i've got fruit

11:03.921 --> 11:05.905
And water
and corn on the cob

11:05.940 --> 11:07.290
And my old quilt.

11:07.325 --> 11:08.340
See?

11:08.393 --> 11:10.093
Listen, i'm really sorry
i gotta leave you alone,

11:10.128 --> 11:12.762
But if sofia finds out,
she'll huff and she'll puff

11:12.797 --> 11:14.197
And, well,
you know the rest.

11:23.108 --> 11:25.908
Yolanda, get back in the tent.

11:31.949 --> 11:32.915
yolanda!

11:32.950 --> 11:34.266
yolanda!
Mm?

11:34.319 --> 11:35.852
I think i hear something!

11:35.887 --> 11:38.221
Yes, a damn fool waking me up
in the middle of the night!

11:39.890 --> 11:41.057
Seriously!

11:41.092 --> 11:43.126
I think there's
something out there.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.144
It's just the sleep machine.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.181
Does that sound
like<i> caribbean breeze</i> to you?

11:50.068 --> 11:51.150
it's off.

11:51.202 --> 11:52.935
Listen.

11:52.971 --> 11:55.838
See? I told you.
Now go back to sleep.

12:01.046 --> 12:02.929
Oh, my damn!
What the hell is that?

12:04.916 --> 12:06.282
It's a chupacabra!

12:06.317 --> 12:08.935
Aah! We're gonna die,
we're gonna die!

12:08.970 --> 12:11.921
I'm sorry for every bad thing
i've ever said to you.

12:11.956 --> 12:13.889
I love you.

12:13.924 --> 12:16.242
I love you too!

12:19.147 --> 12:22.064
Get him! Get him!
Let me live! Get him!

12:30.041 --> 12:32.842
Josh? Why is he calling at--

12:32.877 --> 12:33.876
Uh-oh.

12:35.914 --> 12:37.780
Hey, josh.

12:37.816 --> 12:38.247
What's up?

12:40.251 --> 12:42.785
Why is there a pig
on my terrace?

12:42.821 --> 12:44.787
Uh...

12:44.823 --> 12:47.156
Because you said
i could put him there.

12:47.192 --> 12:50.059
What? Wait,
when did i say that?

12:50.094 --> 12:51.143
<i>Tonight.</i>

12:51.196 --> 12:52.462
<i>I went to your office</i>

12:52.497 --> 12:55.031
When you were sleeping,
and i asked you,
and you said yes.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.165
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.034
A "yes" when i'm asleep
does not count.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.869
It doesn't?

13:01.906 --> 13:04.807
Okay, you just gotta let him
stay there overnight. Okay?

13:04.859 --> 13:06.209
And then tomorrow,
you gotta drop him off
at the diner.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.794
If sofia finds out what i did,

13:07.829 --> 13:08.845
she's gonna walk in right now.

13:09.981 --> 13:11.247
Gabi, who the hell

13:11.282 --> 13:12.865
Is calling you
at 3:00 in the morning?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.183
Um...

13:14.219 --> 13:16.752
No, mr. Fancy,
i do not want

13:16.788 --> 13:19.021
A one-way ticket
to fancy town!

13:20.058 --> 13:21.157
Good night!

13:21.209 --> 13:23.059
Ugh, what a pig.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.027
You have no idea.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.934
Hi, this is gabi
from fancy's diner.

13:31.986 --> 13:33.069
I'm just calling
to check to see

13:33.104 --> 13:34.870
If the pig picker-upper
is on his way

13:34.923 --> 13:36.806
To pick up the pig?

13:36.858 --> 13:37.940
Pardon?

13:37.975 --> 13:38.941
Perfect.

13:41.246 --> 13:42.845
Oh, gabi!

13:44.282 --> 13:47.266
Josh! Hey!
Thanks for bringing
the pig here.

13:47.301 --> 13:49.185
Um, listen, again,
i'm really, really sorry.

13:49.237 --> 13:50.319
Yeah, save it
for yolanda and elliot.

13:50.354 --> 13:52.021
You scared
the crap out of 'em.

13:52.056 --> 13:53.222
Which reminds me,

13:53.257 --> 13:54.190
You have to have their tent
professionally cleaned.

13:56.127 --> 13:59.061
Oh. My. God.

13:59.097 --> 14:00.997
Sofia, what are
you doing here?

14:01.032 --> 14:02.014
I switched you
to the night shift.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.900
Well, that is
exactly why i'm here.

14:03.935 --> 14:04.900
I knew something was up.

14:04.953 --> 14:06.068
You changing my shift,
balancing the till,

14:06.104 --> 14:08.003
Being smart.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.839
I balanced the till!

14:09.874 --> 14:11.874
Of course!
He's been helping you!

14:11.910 --> 14:13.259
Well, not anymore.
I'm out of here.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.227
Bye!

14:17.815 --> 14:19.265
Okay, i just can't figure out
why the pig is here.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.184
Oh, well, i guess
you're just not as smart as--

14:21.219 --> 14:23.219
The bulk order.

14:23.254 --> 14:26.155
You tried to save money
ordering bacon,

14:26.190 --> 14:27.290
And you ordered a pig.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.059
Are you finally ready to admit
that i should be manager?

14:30.094 --> 14:31.127
Good morning, everybody!

14:31.162 --> 14:33.128
Fine. You're the manager.

14:33.163 --> 14:35.014
What? No, you gotta get
this pig out of here.

14:35.066 --> 14:36.148
No, no, you gotta get
this pig out of here.

14:36.201 --> 14:38.000
You're the manager.
You have to help me

14:38.035 --> 14:39.935
Because if he comes back here
and sees the three of us,

14:39.988 --> 14:41.904
We're going to get fired.
Okay, fine.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.807
Why is it lying down?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.876
Why is there a little hoof
coming out of its--

14:46.911 --> 14:48.945
Oh, my god,
it's pregnant!

14:48.980 --> 14:50.913
it's giving birth right now!

14:52.217 --> 14:53.249
Aww!
Ew!

14:56.896 --> 14:58.746
<i>Doesn't have to be without</i>
<i>the college experience.</i>

14:58.782 --> 14:59.864
I don't know how
to deliver a piglet.

14:59.916 --> 15:01.649
Yeah, neither do i.

15:01.685 --> 15:03.818
But i do know how
to distract mr. Fancy.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.741
Good morning, mr. Fancy.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.493
Can i cook you
a little breakfast?
You look hungry.

15:13.596 --> 15:14.562
Thank you.

15:14.597 --> 15:15.646
You keep this up,

15:15.699 --> 15:17.548
You'll find yourself
a sugar daddy in no time.

15:19.668 --> 15:21.569
Let's have those eggs, okay?

15:21.621 --> 15:22.837
With extra bacon.

15:24.507 --> 15:25.506
Can it be veggie bacon?

15:30.546 --> 15:31.812
The first two piglets
came out fine,

15:31.865 --> 15:33.798
But the first one's stuck
and the mom is in pain.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.433
Sofia...

15:35.485 --> 15:36.901
I think we need
to call an adult.

15:39.656 --> 15:40.855
We got one.

15:40.890 --> 15:42.857
What the hell
is a pig doing
in my diner?

15:42.892 --> 15:44.792
Um, it's having babies.

15:44.827 --> 15:46.627
And something's wrong!

15:47.731 --> 15:49.597
Are there any doctors
in the house?

15:50.716 --> 15:52.617
Who know how
to deliver a pig?

15:52.652 --> 15:53.584
Oh!

15:53.670 --> 15:55.553
I grew up on a farm
in iowa!

15:55.638 --> 15:57.472
We had a few acres.

15:57.507 --> 15:58.573
Chickens, pigs--

15:58.608 --> 16:00.441
I don't want to hear
your whole life story, okay?

16:00.477 --> 16:01.542
Just get in there.
Sure.

16:01.577 --> 16:02.810
Okay?
Okay.

16:04.481 --> 16:05.747
Nice keister.

16:07.484 --> 16:09.383
This pig is in breach!

16:09.419 --> 16:10.818
Yeah, and she's pregnant.

16:12.855 --> 16:14.689
Whoa, what's going on here?

16:14.724 --> 16:16.690
Uh, the pig you delivered
is delivering.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.426
How could you send us
a pregnant pig?

16:18.461 --> 16:20.695
Sorry about that.
We just hired a new manager.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.830
Say no more.
Well, that explains it.

16:22.865 --> 16:26.650
Girls, this age-appropriate
woman has it covered.

16:26.703 --> 16:28.586
So, uh, send the customers home

16:28.638 --> 16:29.670
And close the diner.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.439
Okay, great.
When do you want
us to come back?

16:31.474 --> 16:32.440
How's never?

16:33.510 --> 16:35.443
I don't want to see you again.

16:35.478 --> 16:36.577
Unless it's on snapchat.

16:38.481 --> 16:39.480
Out you go.

16:48.725 --> 16:50.792
Can't believe
mr. Fancy fired us.

16:50.827 --> 16:51.826
Really?

16:53.763 --> 16:55.596
Violated sanitation laws,

16:55.632 --> 16:56.781
Brought a live animal
to a restaurant,

16:56.816 --> 16:58.699
Freaked out the customers,
and ruined the kitchen.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.536
Yeah, we really screwed up.

17:02.572 --> 17:03.538
We?

17:04.574 --> 17:06.491
Okay, fine. You.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.542
None of this
would have happened

17:07.594 --> 17:09.477
If you hadn't made
me feel so stupid.

17:09.512 --> 17:10.578
How did i make
you feel stupid?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.446
Oh, please.
Like you don't know.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.497
As soon as i got
that manager job,

17:13.550 --> 17:15.483
You started acting
all smartypants with me.

17:15.518 --> 17:17.351
No, i didn't!

17:17.387 --> 17:18.536
I just said that
i'm more experienced

17:18.571 --> 17:20.471
And went to college
and you can't do basic math--

17:20.506 --> 17:21.689
Oh, there it is.

17:22.826 --> 17:23.724
I'm sorry.

17:23.760 --> 17:24.959
It's okay.

17:24.994 --> 17:26.828
You don't have to apologize
for being smarter than me.

17:26.863 --> 17:28.696
Oh, i'm not smarter than you.

17:28.731 --> 17:29.797
I mean, maybe
in, like, math

17:29.849 --> 17:32.700
And english,
and... School stuff,

17:32.735 --> 17:34.585
But that's just because
i'm book-smart

17:34.620 --> 17:35.753
And you're--
cook-smart?

17:35.805 --> 17:37.638
Yeah, i like that.

17:37.674 --> 17:39.473
People can't eat books.

17:40.543 --> 17:43.444
Exactly, and you are
an expert at cooking.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.612
I'm not an expert at anything.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.464
that's true.

17:47.517 --> 17:49.483
Oh, i guess we're both losers.

17:49.518 --> 17:51.452
I will drink to that.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.504
Gabi, it's 11:00 am.
Yeah. Who cares?
We don't have jobs.

17:54.891 --> 17:57.391
Hey, i just thought of a way
to get our jobs back.

17:57.427 --> 18:00.761
How?
We sue mr. Fancy
for sexual harassment.

18:00.813 --> 18:01.845
Do you have any proof?

18:01.898 --> 18:03.698
No. Do you?

18:04.884 --> 18:05.766
No.

18:10.807 --> 18:13.541
Mr. Fancy!
Um, i'm gonna
grab my phone,

18:13.576 --> 18:16.510
But not to record anything
inappropriate you might say.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.761
Hold it right there,
sweet cheeks.

18:17.814 --> 18:19.680
Dammit!
Girls...

18:19.716 --> 18:22.416
You have your jobs back.

18:22.452 --> 18:23.517
really?

18:23.570 --> 18:24.619
What do we have to do?

18:26.522 --> 18:27.638
Nothing.

18:27.673 --> 18:30.358
After you left,
i kind of hit it off
with arlene,

18:30.393 --> 18:31.876
The woman who
delivered the piglet.

18:31.911 --> 18:35.396
First broad i've liked
since mrs. Fancy passed.

18:35.431 --> 18:36.797
Ohh.

18:36.832 --> 18:38.733
And you're, uh,
hiring us back

18:38.768 --> 18:40.735
Because if i hadn't brought
a live animal to the diner,

18:40.770 --> 18:41.936
You never would have met her?

18:41.971 --> 18:45.756
No, i don't have time to hire
a new waitress or a manager.

18:45.808 --> 18:48.692
Arlene and i are going
to acapulco.

18:48.745 --> 18:51.579
Oh, that's nice.
For how long?

18:51.614 --> 18:53.698
Uh, till i run out
of my blue pills.

18:56.519 --> 18:58.452
Ew.
Romantic.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.488
So, will you be going back
to work tomorrow?

19:00.523 --> 19:02.490
Um, yes, but actually,

19:02.525 --> 19:04.525
Mr. Fancy,
um, sofia should
really be the manager.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.428
She's book-smart
and i'm cook-smart.

19:07.463 --> 19:08.596
"cook-smart"?

19:08.631 --> 19:10.564
What the hell is that?

19:10.599 --> 19:11.866
Ah, it doesn't matter.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.467
Shakira, you're the new manager.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.370
And i'll go back
to being fry cook.

19:16.406 --> 19:17.771
Uh, no can do.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.757
I just hired
a new one last night.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.375
Wait, but now
i don't have a job.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.744
Well, i'd fire her, but, uh,

19:23.780 --> 19:25.713
She recorded
some stuff i said,

19:25.748 --> 19:26.681
And i don't want any trouble.

19:28.884 --> 19:30.785
But she doesn't work
on weekends.

19:30.820 --> 19:31.785
Oh, okay, i'll take it.

19:31.820 --> 19:33.754
Absolutely great.
<i>Adios,</i> girls!

19:37.794 --> 19:39.677
Gabi, you can't pay rent
working part-time.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.629
What are you gonna do?

19:44.784 --> 19:47.635
Josh, i need your help again...

19:47.670 --> 19:48.636
Again.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.370
I brought you
extra marshmallows

19:58.405 --> 20:00.289
For your cocoa.
Oh, good.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.373
I brought extra cocoa.

20:07.465 --> 20:11.383
I really appreciate you doing
this with me again, yolanda.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.468
Oh, no problem, baby.

20:12.503 --> 20:15.253
All you have to do is
get through one whole night

20:15.306 --> 20:16.388
With nothing bad happening,

20:16.423 --> 20:19.308
And you'll be camping
with alan in no time.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.310
To never being scared again.

20:26.466 --> 20:29.234
Hey, guys.
Aah! Chupacabra!

20:31.355 --> 20:33.238
No, it-- it's me.
It's gabi.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.323
I know.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.326
Anyway, great news.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.443
I'm coming back
to work for josh.
