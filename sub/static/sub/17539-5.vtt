00:02.044 --> 00:05.088
Mirror, Mirror,
what does our future hold?

00:05.088 --> 00:07.799
Show me what happens
when our stories unfold.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.566
(shrieks) What is
this hideous place?

00:24.566 --> 00:27.486
‐(sighing) My home.
‐We're in the Isle
of the Lost?

00:27.486 --> 00:29.947
Ew! Ben, save me!

00:29.947 --> 00:32.199
Now I know why they say
be careful what you wish for.

00:32.199 --> 00:35.536
I had forgotten
how bad this city's
drainage system is.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.038
They seriously need
better catch basins.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.250
‐Really?
‐I'm taking Sustainable
Urban Planning this semester.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.793
Does it say
where we are?

00:42.793 --> 00:46.296
Thanks to my dad,
there is no service
in the Isle of the Lost.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.590
So we can't even find
a way out of here?

00:48.590 --> 00:51.176
‐Can we even selfie?
‐(shutter clicks)

00:51.176 --> 00:54.513
Okay, this place needs
so many filters.

00:56.265 --> 00:59.309
Uh, excuse me, ma'am?
You dropped... my wallet.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.603
‐We should find
a place to hide.
‐Uh, yeah.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.773
Before anybody sees
we're here. There.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.776
How are we supposed
to get there?
There's mud everywhere.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.194
I'll just throw
my jacket over the‐‐

01:09.194 --> 01:12.364
Why would you cover up
such a perfect puddle of mud?

01:12.364 --> 01:14.950
Whoo! (laughs)

01:14.950 --> 01:18.495
Liking mud is
not a VK thing.
It's a Mal thing.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.540
Wait. Is this place
even open?

01:21.540 --> 01:24.459
(laughs) "Store hours:
Whenever we feel like it!!!"

01:24.459 --> 01:27.087
Look at all of this junk.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.633
Oh! "Dictatorship
for Beginners."

01:31.633 --> 01:34.511
It's so beautiful.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.514
Oh. Don't get jelly.

01:37.514 --> 01:41.893
It figures the only remotely
interesting item here would be
on the must‐go rack.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.062
What's this?

01:44.062 --> 01:46.148
It's beautiful!

01:46.148 --> 01:47.691
Are you stealing that?

01:47.691 --> 01:50.777
It was hanging with the dress.
I would never steal.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.946
I meant, why are
you stealing that

01:52.946 --> 01:55.324
when you could be
stealing this?

01:55.324 --> 01:57.200
It's way cuter.
Go ahead, take it.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.202
No, I can't.
That's wrong.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.997
That's the whole point.
It's what we do here.

02:01.997 --> 02:03.498
Go on, take it.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.459
‐Oh no.
‐Oh no, what?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.252
It's... (sighs) Freddy.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.504
Freddy?
Short for Frederique?

02:09.504 --> 02:12.466
Short for "Let's blow
this voodoo stand."

02:12.466 --> 02:13.467
