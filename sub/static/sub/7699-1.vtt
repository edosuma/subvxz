WEBVTT

01:23.541 --> 01:25.459
A valiant effort,
stout sentinel,

01:25.543 --> 01:28.087
but the game was ours before it began.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.352
<i>Time to fly.</i>

01:54.655 --> 01:55.698
Wait, gentlemen.

01:58.075 --> 02:00.786
So, what do they pay you here, Henry?

02:01.162 --> 02:07.460
Nine, ten dollars an hour? A grand total
of, what, four, $425 a week?

02:07.752 --> 02:09.754
- Fox, come on!
- Let's see,

02:09.837 --> 02:13.716
that'd be $21,000 a year.
Can that be right?

02:16.469 --> 02:19.597
Here. In appreciation
for services rendered.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.767
- We won't tell.
- Beats a gold watch.

02:26.145 --> 02:27.188
Ah, ah, ah.

02:27.313 --> 02:30.941
It's business decisions like that
that got you where you are today.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.985
Come, gentlemen. Let us away.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.612
Did you hear that?

02:46.499 --> 02:47.750
Allow me.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.634
Don't worry about me. Get them!

02:56.967 --> 02:58.135
It'll be a pleasure.

03:20.866 --> 03:23.119
Hate to tell you,
but the costume party's over.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.955
You want me, Tweety Bird? Come on, then.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.624
Robin! Stop!

03:31.419 --> 03:32.628
He smells it.

03:34.171 --> 03:35.256
Plan B, then.

03:48.352 --> 03:50.521
See? I told you this would be fun.

04:05.911 --> 04:07.997
The Terrible Trio strikes again.

04:08.414 --> 04:12.084
How about those masks?
They look like refugees from Mardi Gras.

04:12.585 --> 04:15.337
Predators of land, sea and air.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.715
Maybe they're experts in those areas.

04:18.048 --> 04:21.385
The only thing these guys
are experts in is arrogance.

04:34.565 --> 04:35.733
Thanks, Kevin.

04:40.821 --> 04:41.989
"Thanks, Kevin"?

04:42.072 --> 04:44.116
Awfully chummy with the help, Bruce.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.244
Do you thank the garbage man
for picking up your trash?

04:47.536 --> 04:48.913
If I happen to run into him.

04:48.996 --> 04:50.623
Don't get Warren started, Bruce.

04:50.956 --> 04:53.626
You know how
he feels about the servants.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.169
Gunther, Army, please.

04:55.586 --> 04:59.340
I'm just trying to protect Bruce
from his baser instincts. Pull!

05:05.304 --> 05:08.849
So this is all you do for kicks, Bruce?
Charity work?

05:08.933 --> 05:11.018
Well, I do have a nightlife.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.817
Besides, it's important to help others.

05:18.108 --> 05:20.653
It may sound corny,
but, hey, it's how I feel.

05:20.903 --> 05:24.365
But you must recognize
that you are a superior animal, Bruce.

05:24.865 --> 05:26.617
A member of the elite. Pull!

05:29.578 --> 05:31.163
Take my Delta brothers and me.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.499
Why, we've run with the bulls.

05:33.749 --> 05:35.292
Shot game from hot air balloons.

05:35.543 --> 05:36.961
Killed a great white.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.797
We've done it all.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.342
Ah, therein lies the problem.

05:43.467 --> 05:47.346
After all, what do the rajahs do
when there are no more tigers to hunt?

05:47.596 --> 05:50.307
I'm sure you'll
think of something, Warren.

05:52.476 --> 05:56.814
Dollar for dollar, that has to be
the dullest man in Gotham City.

06:03.487 --> 06:05.823
It should be obvious
even to you, Rebecca.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.242
That dress is not appropriate attire.

06:08.492 --> 06:11.120
Oh, Father, you just don't quit, do you?

06:12.288 --> 06:13.956
Sheldon, nice to see you here.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.000
The pleasure's all ours, Bruce.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.252
Rebecca and I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.796
- Isn't that right, dear?
- Right.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.632
Excuse me.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.135
Children.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.804
I thought you'd never finish
that stupid game.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.434
Careful, darling, Pater is watching.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.478
He's always watching.

06:37.187 --> 06:41.108
If you think he's mad now, wait until
he gets this month's credit card bill.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.737
And how much did that little frock
set Daddums back?

06:45.237 --> 06:46.822
Five thousand.

06:47.197 --> 06:48.657
I'd say it was worth it.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.701
I don't know how I'm gonna tell him.

07:07.509 --> 07:10.095
Oh, Warren, you are a lifesaver.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.056
It's only money.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.557
With Daddy leaving town,

07:13.641 --> 07:16.477
I should be able to slip this into
his account, no problem.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.688
Catch you in the pool.

07:30.157 --> 07:32.952
Well, old man, I'd say
that fluttering sound you hear

07:33.077 --> 07:35.245
is your check sprouting wings
and flying away.

07:35.329 --> 07:39.500
Actually, I thought that daddy
might be willing to reimburse me.

08:16.203 --> 08:19.123
Ah, well, Ming was
a boring dynasty anyway.

08:19.206 --> 08:20.541
I don't know about this.

08:20.874 --> 08:24.294
It's one thing to steal from strangers,
but we know Fallbrook.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.673
Yes, adds a bit
of extra spice, doesn't it?

08:28.298 --> 08:29.383
Hands up!

08:32.636 --> 08:34.346
She said he'd be out of town.

08:38.517 --> 08:42.062
Hello, police? This is Sheldon Fallbrook
at the Gotham Park Towers.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.772
I want to report-

08:55.034 --> 08:58.287
That's where you belong, old man.
At my feet.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.706
Come on.
The police will be here any minute.

09:43.707 --> 09:45.918
<i><i>All units,
possible robbery in progress</i></i>

09:46.001 --> 09:48.504
<i>at Gotham Park Towers,
28th floor residence.</i>

10:01.058 --> 10:03.560
I presume a good time was had by all?

10:04.311 --> 10:05.395
Warren, it's him.

10:09.566 --> 10:11.360
Have a little backbone, Army.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.058
My turn.

10:52.442 --> 10:53.735
He's hooked us!

11:10.878 --> 11:12.671
- I can't shake him.
- What do we do?

11:12.754 --> 11:14.840
- Quick! Dump the money!
- What?

11:15.257 --> 11:17.134
Dump the money! Now!

11:22.806 --> 11:24.183
Hey, free money!

11:52.836 --> 11:53.879
Aced it!

11:53.962 --> 11:57.424
And once again,
we owe it all to the little people.

12:02.512 --> 12:03.555
Daddy?

12:05.265 --> 12:06.808
Daddy, can you hear me?

12:07.351 --> 12:08.769
I'm so sorry.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.104
You might as well
go on home, Ms. Fallbrook.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.482
No telling when your father
will come out of this.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.818
<i>Dr. Forrest,
dial 118, please.</i>

12:18.153 --> 12:20.155
Bruce. It's nice of you to come.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.824
If there's anything I can do, Rebecca...

12:25.035 --> 12:26.203
Warren.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.334
I came as soon as I heard.

12:32.626 --> 12:37.047
My poor Becky. Dreadful business.
So senseless.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.843
Come, let me take your mind off this.

12:42.302 --> 12:44.805
<i>Dr. Kravitz, you have
a visitor in the main lobby.</i>

13:02.781 --> 13:06.034
You know, Becks, I don't think
you should be alone right now.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.578
The fellows and I were thinking
about the mountains this weekend.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.914
A change of scenery might do you good.

13:32.519 --> 13:35.105
So the police still have
no idea who the thieves are?

13:35.814 --> 13:37.482
No, I guess not.

13:38.066 --> 13:39.359
But I hope they find them soon.

13:39.735 --> 13:43.155
You know, I really shouldn't be here.
I mean, what if my father wakes up?

13:43.572 --> 13:48.577
Come off it, Rebecca. Anyone would
think you actually liked the old coot.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.746
Well, he is my father.

13:50.912 --> 13:53.248
Don't worry. We left the number here
with the hospital.

13:53.373 --> 13:55.542
And we're only an hour's drive
from the city.

13:56.251 --> 13:57.294
Well...

13:57.711 --> 13:58.962
Time for a feast.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.132
We're going to cheer you up
whether you like it or not.

14:02.382 --> 14:03.717
You're too sweet.

14:13.810 --> 14:16.271
It's Dad's stick pin. How did it-

14:21.985 --> 14:23.070
No-

14:34.539 --> 14:36.041
According to the computer,

14:36.124 --> 14:39.378
this is probably the ring that made
the mark on Fallbrook's jaw.

14:39.503 --> 14:43.298
It belongs to a frat,
Delta Sigma Alpha, mostly rich boys.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.176
Like Warren Lawford
and his Delta brothers.

14:46.426 --> 14:49.012
All three of them inherited
family fortunes.

14:49.679 --> 14:51.473
Lawford gets his from oil.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.309
Lydecker's father owned
an aerodynamics firm.

14:54.518 --> 14:57.104
And Hardwick's father
was a shipping magnate.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.689
Land, air and water.

14:59.981 --> 15:01.525
It can't be a coincidence.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.027
Scoundrels like these are worse
than the Joker.

15:04.277 --> 15:06.696
At least he's got madness as an excuse.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.991
But they've got more money
than the mint. Why would they steal?

15:10.784 --> 15:14.413
Because we were bored!
Don't you get it? It was a game.

15:14.621 --> 15:15.789
A game?

15:16.123 --> 15:17.457
We've done everything else.

15:17.707 --> 15:20.001
Treasure hunts, safaris,
deep-sea diving.

15:20.168 --> 15:23.755
We wanted a new challenge.
You know, the thrill of the chase.

15:23.922 --> 15:28.343
And we were good at it.
We outfoxed the police and the Batman.

15:28.635 --> 15:31.304
But the people you hurt, my father...

15:31.721 --> 15:34.224
We never meant
to hurt him, Becky. Really.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.685
Of course not. And we'll pay him back.

15:37.018 --> 15:39.896
Sure we will.
Hey, we'll pay everybody back.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.526
- You won't tell anyone, right?
- No. Oh, no, of course not.

15:51.867 --> 15:55.579
- You'll tell.
- No, Warren. I won't, really.

15:55.954 --> 15:59.583
She's a liability, one we can't afford.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.751
Whoa, timeout, old man.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.962
This is getting extreme.
There are limits to-

16:04.045 --> 16:06.256
Haven't you listened
to anything I've told you?

16:06.339 --> 16:09.259
We are beyond limitations!
Beyond restriction!

16:09.593 --> 16:11.887
She's your girlfriend,
for crying out loud!

16:12.095 --> 16:14.639
She's a spoiled, willful child.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.224
And if we let her go...

16:17.976 --> 16:21.563
- She will tell. Ow!
- You're out of your minds, all of you!

16:25.734 --> 16:28.236
In for a penny, in for a pound.

16:41.833 --> 16:43.752
Warren, for pity's sake.

16:44.085 --> 16:47.547
Enough, Army!
I want this done with, now!

17:21.748 --> 17:23.291
- Take over.
- Sure.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.210
Leave me to steer with a broken arm.

19:45.642 --> 19:48.937
Let's go, Fox.
You've raided your last chicken coop.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.439
Wait, wait a minute. We can make a deal.

19:51.856 --> 19:54.484
A million dollars to let me go.

19:55.026 --> 19:58.822
Ten million!
Think about it. Buys a lot of Batarangs.

19:59.447 --> 20:01.116
Your money's no good here.

20:01.324 --> 20:04.786
Okay, fine. Go ahead. Take me in, hero.

20:04.869 --> 20:07.414
I've got every judge
in town in my pocket.

20:07.706 --> 20:11.876
You'll see. I'll get justice,
the best that money can buy!
