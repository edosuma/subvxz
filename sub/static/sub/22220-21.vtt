WEBVTT

00:14.390 --> 00:18.474
Pilot:
The Peacekeeper scan is
directly over us...

00:19.478 --> 00:21.139
now.

00:23.441 --> 00:25.306
I believe we will survive
the scan.

00:25.401 --> 00:29.110
It's the frelling cold that
will claim me.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.232
( sneezes )

00:31.741 --> 00:34.027
Why the yotz can't we have
a little heat?

00:34.118 --> 00:36.985
Because the Karjik Pulse
is attuned to energy
sources, Rygel.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.285
We're chilled, but we're alive.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.034
Well that depends on
your definition.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.582
That's not a Marauder
scanning us.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.876
That's Crais' full
Command Carrier.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.955
Chiana:
Nobody else is going to ask.
I'll ask.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.460
Zhaan.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.462
How come you're not frozen?

00:52.553 --> 00:56.262
My body temperature
self-regulates under
most conditions.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.263
Pilot, how's the baby doing?

01:06.359 --> 01:10.318
Excuse me, but Moya is
picking up something.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.986
It appears to be...

01:13.074 --> 01:15.065
some sort of distress call.

01:15.159 --> 01:16.319
Source?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.241
From one of the surrounding
asteroids.

01:18.329 --> 01:20.285
I'll see if I can isolate it.

01:21.374 --> 01:23.786
Please, please, please, hear me.

01:23.876 --> 01:26.162
I'm stranded here
with my family.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.415
We're under attack.

01:28.506 --> 01:32.624
Please help us! Please come
quickly. As soon as you can.

01:32.718 --> 01:33.924
There's a creature...

01:34.011 --> 01:35.262
( screams )

01:35.346 --> 01:37.337
( loud bellowing )

01:38.432 --> 01:40.343
Could this be a
Peacekeeper trick?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.140
Zhaan:
Yes, that's entirely possible.

01:42.228 --> 01:46.221
No, the transmission source
is coming from an asteroid
close by.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.271
Pilot:
The signal is weak.

01:48.359 --> 01:50.941
It is unlikely Crais' ship
even heard it.

01:51.028 --> 01:55.317
Aeryn:
We can't escape this asteroid
field without some sort of navigational aid.

01:55.408 --> 01:57.990
Maybe this girl and her family
have charts.

01:58.077 --> 02:00.989
Rygel:
You're not seriously considering
going down there, are you?

02:01.080 --> 02:03.162
For goodness sake, didn't
you see that thing?

02:03.249 --> 02:05.661
You do not have to go down
there, Your Flatulence.

02:05.751 --> 02:06.957
(grunts)

02:07.044 --> 02:10.286
Chiana:
Distress call directed at us.

02:11.215 --> 02:14.799
(laughing)

02:14.885 --> 02:16.796
How stupid is that?

02:16.887 --> 02:18.388
(laughing)

02:22.476 --> 02:24.512
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

02:24.603 --> 02:28.061
...a radiation wave hit and I
got shot through a wormhole...

02:28.149 --> 02:30.686
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship.

02:30.776 --> 02:34.234
A living ship full of strange
alien life-forms...

02:34.322 --> 02:35.357
Help me...

02:35.448 --> 02:36.563
Listen, please.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.693
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

02:38.784 --> 02:42.868
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

02:42.955 --> 02:45.162
...doing everything I can...

02:45.249 --> 02:47.661
I'm just looking for
a way home.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.143
Unacceptable!

03:11.233 --> 03:13.940
There are over 20,000 asteroids
of sufficient size

03:14.028 --> 03:16.064
to block the Leviathan from
our scans, sir.

03:16.155 --> 03:19.147
Then we enter the field and
change our angle of projection!

03:19.241 --> 03:22.825
If we do that, we sacrifice
maneuverability.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.113
I left orders not to
be disturbed.

03:27.208 --> 03:34.455
Of course, Captain, but as
you labor to recapture
the Leviathan,

03:34.548 --> 03:39.668
I thought I might offer a
course of action it seems you
have not considered yet.

03:43.974 --> 03:49.344
Do you think a mother would
abandon her child?

03:51.357 --> 03:54.269
If I was in command, Captain,

03:54.360 --> 03:59.445
I would concentrate on the
Leviathan's newborn.

03:59.532 --> 04:03.571
Bombard the area with
multi-frequency signals.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.201
Discordant stimuli.

04:06.288 --> 04:11.248
See if I couldn't make the
offspring reveal itself
in panic.

04:11.335 --> 04:15.669
And its mother along
with it, hmm?

04:19.260 --> 04:21.546
Sir? Your orders?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.628
My orders stand.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.554
Change our position.

04:36.235 --> 04:39.227
The Peacekeeper scan has passed.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.028
Crichton:
One, two, three, four to
beam down, Pilot.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.697
Pilot:
Officer Sun.

04:43.784 --> 04:49.199
I would appreciate if you
would stay aboard.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.746
Alright, Pilot.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.575
Zhaan:
| suggest we deactivate our
Comms, just for safety's sake.

04:53.669 --> 04:58.083
Aeryn:
Now remember, minimum use of
thrusters and keep plenty of rock between you and Crais.

04:58.174 --> 04:59.209
Right?

04:59.300 --> 05:00.665
Got it.

05:12.688 --> 05:15.976
D'Argo:
This is the most miserable place
I think l have ever been.

05:16.066 --> 05:19.149
Zhaan:
Where you see misery, D'Argo,
| find the end of misery.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.227
Well, to put things in
perspective, Zhaan,

05:21.322 --> 05:24.280
you are the least thing on this
asteroid that I'm allergic to.

05:24.366 --> 05:27.608
Crichton:
The big guy's got a point.
My rashes have got rashes.

05:27.703 --> 05:32.242
I assure you the cure for all
those ailments and much
more is also here.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.288
So you keep saying.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.366
Well, look around.
What don't you see?

05:35.461 --> 05:39.500
No animals, no aviary, no
insects, nothing to compete
with the flora.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.707
This magnificent place is the
Goddess's pharmacognosia.

05:42.801 --> 05:48.216
Hey, don't forget, happy
campers, the girl in the
distress signal said "creature."

05:48.307 --> 05:51.299
Well, she's probably
dead by now.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.226
Which is what I'll be if I
don't get off this asteroid.

05:54.313 --> 05:57.020
Are you picking up any
being's scent?

05:57.107 --> 06:01.771
Zhaan, let me explain to you
what's going on inside my
nose right now.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.979
There's large pieces of green
mucus and gunk and...

06:05.074 --> 06:08.282
D'Argo, no, no, no.
Stop it with the Luxan poetry.

06:08.369 --> 06:12.078
(low growling)

06:12.164 --> 06:14.325
There's some healthy
sounding sinuses.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.997
(woman screams )

06:16.085 --> 06:17.746
-Stick with me, D'Argo.
-l'm there.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.963
(woman screaming )

06:24.176 --> 06:25.882
Go! Go!

06:27.221 --> 06:30.179
(screaming and growling
continues )

06:30.266 --> 06:31.472
Hey!

06:31.559 --> 06:32.719
(roaring)

06:32.810 --> 06:33.970
Hey!

06:34.061 --> 06:35.972
(gasping)

06:38.023 --> 06:39.354
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

06:39.441 --> 06:40.647
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

06:40.734 --> 06:43.851
Help me! Help me!
Help me, please?!

06:43.946 --> 06:45.311
It's all right.
You're safe now.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.442
Where are the others?
Where's your family?

06:47.533 --> 06:48.648
You have to protect me.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.324
No, listen to me.
Where are the others?

06:51.412 --> 06:53.323
He killed them all.
Please, help me.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.574
They're dead?

06:54.665 --> 06:55.996
Please. Please help me.
Please, please, please.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.244
He got away. He knows the
terrain too well.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.543
My name is Zhaan. This is
Crichton. That's D'Argo.
We're here to help you, dear.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.997
-What's your name?
-I am M'Lee.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.255
Look, do you have any maps so
we can find our way out of
this asteroid field?

07:08.345 --> 07:10.131
Used to. All destroyed.

07:10.222 --> 07:13.134
All gone. Please, don't leave
me behind here. Not with him.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.886
Let's go back to the
Transport Pod.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.933
Transport Pod?
ls-is it well guarded?

07:17.021 --> 07:18.306
-Come on.
-Well protected?

07:18.397 --> 07:20.513
If not, he will find it.
He will attack it.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.189
Please, take me with you!

07:22.276 --> 07:25.234
Please, let me go with you!

07:25.321 --> 07:27.437
Please, take me with you!

07:30.659 --> 07:31.774
D'Argo:
Fire up the drive.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.450
I'm on it.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.199
Whoa!

07:36.290 --> 07:38.201
( screams )

07:38.292 --> 07:39.202
(roaring)

07:39.293 --> 07:40.203
D'Argo!

07:42.546 --> 07:43.752
( screams )

07:50.804 --> 07:52.669
I told you this was a
miserable place.

07:52.765 --> 07:54.175
Where are you hurt?

07:54.266 --> 07:57.303
At the moment, everywhere.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.847
It's gone.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.519
The access point is secure.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.723
It ain't getting back in.
We're safe.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.682
And crippled.

08:05.778 --> 08:07.268
I hit the second fuel pump.

08:07.363 --> 08:09.820
You hit the main
pressure control.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.693
Yeah, I'll fix it.
Are you okay?

08:11.784 --> 08:15.197
l have a broken terok.

08:15.287 --> 08:18.324
Probably internal bleeding,
but... I-

08:20.501 --> 08:23.038
(gasping)

08:24.588 --> 08:29.127
Definitely internal bleeding.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.300
(gasping)

08:39.269 --> 08:40.850
Aeryn:
What is it, Pilot?
What's wrong?

08:40.938 --> 08:43.975
Besides the obvious,
a great deal.

08:44.066 --> 08:47.354
I don't know who else I
can trust but you.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.400
Trust about what?

08:49.488 --> 08:52.605
Are you aware that Moya's
offspring isn't normal?

08:52.700 --> 08:55.487
The Peacekeepers have
altered its genetics.

08:55.577 --> 09:00.913
Created a ship that is part
Leviathan, part attack vessel.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.081
We've all seen the
baby's weaponry.

09:03.168 --> 09:08.629
Moya is having difficulty
establishing a connection
to her progeny.

09:08.716 --> 09:09.876
How so?

09:09.967 --> 09:12.333
The offspring knows he
is different.

09:12.428 --> 09:15.295
There is tension between
Moya and him.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.298
What do you expect me
to do about it?

09:19.393 --> 09:20.974
You were a Peacekeeper.

09:21.061 --> 09:26.272
You, better than any of us,
might understand what's
been done to him.

09:26.358 --> 09:34.447
lf Moya were told, perhaps she
could solidify his trust in her.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.865
And us.

09:37.578 --> 09:40.115
You want me to go aboard?

09:40.205 --> 09:42.912
Moya gives you permission
to do so.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.122
But does the baby?

09:47.212 --> 09:49.248
(whirring )

10:01.977 --> 10:04.559
Unbelievable.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.111
Pilot:
Officer Sun.

10:19.203 --> 10:21.239
Pilot, what happened to
radio silence?

10:21.330 --> 10:25.573
Why you're on the offspring's
command, I have a direct
laser link between us.

10:25.667 --> 10:31.082
The only way that Peacekeepers
could intercept is to be
directly in its path.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.004
Oh.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.803
This is astounding, Pilot.

10:39.890 --> 10:45.681
It's a complete synthesis of
Leviathan and warship
technologies.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.652
I need more light.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.601
(rhythmic warbling )

11:08.710 --> 11:11.167
(pulsing hum)

11:11.672 --> 11:13.412
( chuckles )

11:14.049 --> 11:15.664
l have light.

11:15.759 --> 11:20.378
From the exterior, the
offspring appears to possess a
sonic ascendancy cannon.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.014
Yes.

11:27.145 --> 11:30.512
The controls are over here.

11:30.607 --> 11:34.099
It would be advisable to locate
the communications array

11:34.194 --> 11:38.233
as this may be the method the
Peacekeepers will use
to locate us.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.152
Communications array.

11:41.243 --> 11:43.325
(warbling)

11:49.418 --> 11:55.505
Communications array
is in silent mode.

11:55.591 --> 11:58.333
How did you manage to
find it so quickly?

11:58.427 --> 12:01.919
I think I was supposed to.

12:02.014 --> 12:05.131
( beeping )

12:22.117 --> 12:23.323
Hello?

12:23.410 --> 12:26.197
(warbling)

12:26.288 --> 12:28.574
( chuckles )

12:32.753 --> 12:34.289
What are you doing here?

12:34.379 --> 12:37.963
Admiring your quarters,
Captain.

12:38.050 --> 12:43.090
Quite opulent, even by
captain's standards.

12:43.180 --> 12:50.518
I've never understood the need
of some warriors to memorialize
their conquests.

12:50.604 --> 13:00.320
Does displaying this decaying
flesh remind you of past
instances when you were powerful?

13:00.405 --> 13:03.568
Your branch of the service
gives you special privileges,
Scorpius,

13:03.659 --> 13:06.401
which does not include
disrespect of rank.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.951
I want you off my ship.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.528
Of course you do.

13:11.041 --> 13:14.158
Candidly, Captain,

13:14.252 --> 13:19.463
you have continually failed
in all your duties.

13:19.549 --> 13:25.260
Your vector for success has
grown quite small.

13:25.347 --> 13:33.391
Stray outside it, and I fear
this ship soon may need someone
else to command her.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.816
Just swallow it!

13:41.238 --> 13:43.354
If you want to kill me, why
don't you just shoot me?

13:43.448 --> 13:45.063
This herb will stop your
internal bleeding.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.773
Would you rather I cut you
open, D'Argo?

13:46.868 --> 13:48.529
You're no surgeon.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.156
Exactly, now swallow.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.953
(tool whirring)

13:52.040 --> 13:54.156
So, how many in your group
did you say?

13:54.251 --> 13:56.116
Forty one, originally.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.543
We intended to colonize here.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.212
My father, my mother,
two brothers.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.332
And they're all...

14:03.427 --> 14:06.009
The creature gets
ravenous often.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.337
John, we need more kijmot root.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.297
D'Argo's injuries are
not improving.

14:10.392 --> 14:14.180
Right. One quick trip to the
pharmacy coming up.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.933
Out the door, turn left
at the creature.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.436
You smell different.

14:20.402 --> 14:23.189
You smell like out there.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.566
Your olfactory senses
are very good.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.272
I am also flora.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.403
Yeah, right.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.115
Say what?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.197
Didn't you know?

14:35.959 --> 14:37.824
Know what?

14:39.337 --> 14:41.328
You're a plant?

14:41.423 --> 14:42.503
Always have been, John.

14:42.591 --> 14:46.083
Why, does it bother you?

14:46.178 --> 14:51.389
No, it doesn't bother me.
| just never suspected...

14:51.475 --> 14:53.090
you're a vegetable?

14:53.185 --> 14:54.425
( laughs )

14:54.519 --> 14:57.602
Everyone knows that Delvians
are flora evolved.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.350
( growls )

15:03.361 --> 15:04.521
Right.

15:04.613 --> 15:07.400
Sentient floran life isn't all
that unusual, John.

15:07.491 --> 15:10.824
l have cartilaginous fibers
instead of bone.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.323
Tuperadinous cellulose tissue,

15:13.413 --> 15:15.870
and regenerative fascia
membrane.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.167
The blue?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.242
Chloroplast tintation.

15:20.337 --> 15:24.922
The yellow highlights are
stomata for the transpiration
of water.

15:25.008 --> 15:29.798
Ahh! That's why you like
the light so much.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.469
Photosynthesis.

15:31.556 --> 15:32.671
Mm-hmm.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.348
( both chuckling )

15:35.435 --> 15:37.266
You okay?

15:37.354 --> 15:38.594
When was the last time you ate?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.940
I'm not hungry yet.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.227
Huh.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.356
(inhaling)

15:47.447 --> 15:49.108
It's coming.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.155
(whispering ):
Zhaan!

15:51.243 --> 15:52.949
I'm almost finished.
I've got what I need.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.446
You better pick it up!

15:54.538 --> 15:56.403
(whispering ):
M'Lee! Dammit!

15:56.498 --> 15:58.204
You go after her. I've finished.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.576
M'Lee!

16:02.337 --> 16:04.794
(growling in distance)

17:02.105 --> 17:03.185
(roaring)

17:03.273 --> 17:05.059
(Zhaan shrieks)

17:13.450 --> 17:15.816
I'm sorry about your female.
I was scared.

17:15.911 --> 17:17.526
It's not your fault.

17:17.621 --> 17:20.158
No. It was your fault.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.239
You were meant to look after
Zhaan. Instead you went
running...

17:22.334 --> 17:24.199
It was instinct, D'Argo!

17:24.294 --> 17:28.003
You understand instinct.
Every single thing you
do is based on it.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.125
Besides, there was no
indication that she'd been...

17:30.217 --> 17:32.208
M'Lee:
Eaten.

17:32.302 --> 17:36.966
She won't be. The creature will
take your friend to his eating
grounds before killing her.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.173
Eat?

17:39.267 --> 17:40.347
That's it.

17:40.435 --> 17:41.595
Tell me how to get there.

17:41.686 --> 17:42.641
I can't.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.890
You just have to know it.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.357
I'll take you.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.102
No, no, no.
It's too dangerous...

17:48.193 --> 17:49.182
Let her take you, John.

17:49.277 --> 17:52.235
I can smell him long before you
ever know he's around.

17:52.322 --> 17:54.187
I'm much better off than Zhaan.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.863
Go.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.191
Go...

17:57.285 --> 17:59.196
Find her.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.532
Fine. Come on.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.206
(whispering ):
This way.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.003
Over here.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.127
This is where the eating
is done.

18:16.221 --> 18:19.179
We'll be out of here as
fast as we can.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.757
Damn. Ugly leftovers.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.557
Is there another place he
could've taken Zhaan?

18:23.645 --> 18:25.476
(groaning)

18:29.609 --> 18:30.598
You all right?

18:30.694 --> 18:34.607
I'm feeling... hungry.

18:34.698 --> 18:37.735
Look, I'll get you some food
as soon as we get back to
the transport.

18:37.826 --> 18:38.781
Right now...

18:38.868 --> 18:40.324
Food.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.277
M'Lee...

18:42.372 --> 18:45.739
-Food...
-Do not go squirrelly on me
here, all right?

18:45.834 --> 18:47.790
You gotta help me
find my friend.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.414
(hissing)

18:52.257 --> 18:53.747
(shrieking)

18:57.220 --> 18:59.176
( creature roaring )

19:04.936 --> 19:07.643
I... am...

19:07.731 --> 19:10.438
not... your enemy.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.357
(gasping)

19:13.445 --> 19:15.857
She is.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.448
( ragged breathing )

19:18.533 --> 19:20.194
Uh-huh...

19:20.285 --> 19:22.276
Okay.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.330
You requested my presence,
Captain?

19:31.421 --> 19:36.381
Did you suggest to my Bridge
Officer that we do not adjust
our current position?

19:36.468 --> 19:38.424
Yes.

19:38.511 --> 19:42.720
Your Bridge Officer and her
Crew seemed to appreciate the
merits of my suggestion.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.298
You have gone too far,
Scorpius.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.429
You have directly questioned
my command.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.727
Your command begs question.

19:49.814 --> 19:53.306
If my actions were under
examination, I would have
been recalled.

19:55.945 --> 19:58.561
You were recalled.

19:58.656 --> 20:02.649
Do you forget that l have
seen your memories?

20:03.661 --> 20:06.368
That I know of your
insubordination?

20:06.456 --> 20:11.917
That I have witnessed the
execution of your
Second Officer?

20:12.003 --> 20:15.996
When I bring in the Leviathan's
offspring, it will forestall
any of those charges.

20:16.091 --> 20:19.299
Now, get out of my quarters.

20:19.386 --> 20:23.425
I'll tell the Bridge Officer we
won't be changing our course.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.186
I am sorry to have hurt you.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.269
Yeah, a few words would've saved
us a whole lot of trouble.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.195
I find this atmosphere
very thin.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.534
The slightest exertion leaves
me unable to speak.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.574
I had no breath left.

20:45.662 --> 20:49.154
John, M'Lee is a calcivore.
She's a feeder of bone.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.080
So she was going to eat me?

20:51.167 --> 20:54.330
Bpnee:
Yes, just your skeleton.
The flesh is left to rot.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.377
So what were you doing in
our Transport Pod?

20:56.464 --> 20:58.125
Trying to warn you.

20:58.216 --> 21:01.083
I know how the beast
tricks her prey.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.133
Yeah, she said you were
the monster.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.883
Yes. My parents believed
so, too.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.807
But it was just a phase all
children go through.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.054
(laughing)

21:11.146 --> 21:13.262
Br'nee is a scientist, John.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.141
Scientist.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.268
Botanistic pharmacology.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.270
Much like the beautiful Zhaan.

21:21.239 --> 21:23.321
Plants as medicine.

21:23.408 --> 21:24.693
Yes.

21:24.784 --> 21:31.280
My ancestors seeded this barren
asteroid over 300 cycles ago.

21:31.374 --> 21:34.332
I simply led the first
team of harvesters.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.956
What happened to the rest
of your team?

21:39.883 --> 21:41.339
Sorry.

21:41.426 --> 21:42.962
Forget that | asked.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.213
Twenty six in all.

21:45.305 --> 21:48.263
Including my mate.

21:48.349 --> 21:51.591
There weren't supposed to be
any predators here.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.517
No animal life at all!

21:53.605 --> 21:56.642
Zhaan:
They first encountered M'Lee
in her dormant state, John.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.974
As we did.

21:59.068 --> 22:03.277
Bpnee:
She was cunning enough to live
among us for some time

22:03.364 --> 22:06.322
and discover our weaknesses.

22:06.701 --> 22:08.362
What are hers?

22:08.453 --> 22:10.034
Satiation.

22:10.121 --> 22:13.329
After she's eaten her
fill of bones,

22:13.416 --> 22:17.785
she reverts to the passive
creature you experienced.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.211
Zhaan:
It's the only time
she's vulnerable.

22:20.298 --> 22:23.836
When she becomes hungry again
she loses the control of
the transition.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.883
Yeah. Been there, seen that.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.676
We have numbers again.

22:27.764 --> 22:33.225
And after she's eaten one of us
the others will have a chance
to kill her.

22:33.311 --> 22:34.175
Eaten?

22:34.270 --> 22:35.851
Yes.

22:35.939 --> 22:38.681
Br'nee, that's a little
unacceptable.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.772
(distant shrieks)

22:42.862 --> 22:46.400
It's not your choice,
I'm afraid.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.441
It's hers.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.615
Pilot:
Officer Sun...

22:53.706 --> 22:56.118
the Peacekeeper scan is
sweeping this way again.

22:56.209 --> 23:00.452
If you are able, you must
reduce the offspring's energy
signature to bare minimum.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.787
Yes, Pilot.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.372
( beeping )

23:09.514 --> 23:11.129
( beeping )

23:11.224 --> 23:12.634
What?

23:14.561 --> 23:15.641
Come on...

23:15.728 --> 23:17.059
( beeping )

23:19.691 --> 23:22.808
Do you understand what's
happening?

23:22.902 --> 23:26.986
Officer Sun, make him
understand.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.110
If they try to communicate
with you they are called
Peacekeepers

23:30.201 --> 23:34.194
and you must understand they
are not to be believed.

23:37.625 --> 23:41.709
Look, it's true in a perverse
way, you do come from them.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.421
But so do I.

23:49.220 --> 23:57.138
Look, I wish there was more
time for this, but there
isn't any time.

23:57.228 --> 24:01.642
You are going to have to decide
if you will trust your mother...

24:06.362 --> 24:09.024
If you're going to trust me.

24:18.249 --> 24:22.083
( power pulsing down )

24:22.170 --> 24:24.707
(relieved sigh )

24:28.009 --> 24:30.250
Howling's stopped.
What's that mean?

24:30.345 --> 24:34.008
Well, at a guess, she's gone to
see if your tentacled friend

24:34.098 --> 24:35.759
is out in the open by himself.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.136
M'Lee prefers easy prey.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.058
All right then. Pick it up,
Zhaan. We got to go.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.647
Okay. Nearly ready.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.972
These leaves and fungus will
completely heal D'Argo's
injuries.

24:44.067 --> 24:47.400
I thought you wanted brocus
seeds to arrest the infection.

24:47.487 --> 24:50.399
I can't find any. I guess I'm
looking in the wrong place.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.900
You are.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.367
I take it you know a way
back to our transport?

24:56.621 --> 24:58.737
Then pick it up. Let's go.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.698
Brocus histicalx.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.349
Pick as many as you require.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.273
By the goddess, I've never
seen anything like it.

25:27.360 --> 25:32.980
We couldn't transport all the
desired samples if not for the
capacity to miniaturize them.

25:33.074 --> 25:37.283
That is a very impressive
machine.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.577
My aunt had one.
Come on, Zhaan. Let's go.

25:39.664 --> 25:42.531
You must stay behind with
your weapon. It will scare
M'Lee away.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.583
If not, she'll descend on
everything and destroy it all!

25:45.670 --> 25:48.958
There is no way I'm going to
let Zhaan go out there
alone with you.

25:49.048 --> 25:54.714
And no way will I let that
beast destroy everything my
mate died to help accumulate!

25:54.804 --> 25:58.092
We'll be all right, John.

25:58.182 --> 26:01.094
After she's with your friend,
I'll return

26:01.185 --> 26:05.679
and together we can help
transport all the vials
onto your ship.

26:05.773 --> 26:10.437
That is my one condition but
it is non-negotiable!

26:13.364 --> 26:15.605
Fine. Go.

26:20.329 --> 26:26.040
If you're not back in an arn,
M'Lee won't be the only one
hunting you down.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.540
Capisch?

26:41.934 --> 26:45.267
(distant hissing)

26:50.443 --> 26:52.274
M'Lee?

26:54.655 --> 26:55.440
M'Lee!

26:55.531 --> 26:56.987
(roaring)

26:57.074 --> 27:00.532
I'm hungry, John.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.163
M'Lee?

27:10.254 --> 27:12.165
Take it outside, M'Lee.

27:12.256 --> 27:15.748
Us Southern boys don't make good
eatin', not without a fight.

27:22.725 --> 27:23.589
M'Lee?

27:23.684 --> 27:26.141
M'Lee:
l have to eat, John.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.390
And I'm it, huh?

27:30.983 --> 27:34.350
I've been here the whole time.
I've heard what Br'nee
said about me.

27:34.445 --> 27:39.439
What? That you're going to
devour our bones if you
get the chance?

27:39.534 --> 27:41.900
He didn't tell you all of it.

27:41.994 --> 27:46.112
I need you to know the truth.

27:46.207 --> 27:53.079
Is that before or after I
supply your recommended daily
allowance of calcium?

27:53.172 --> 27:54.412
( screeching )

28:00.429 --> 28:05.048
His people brought my ancestors
to this asteroid for a purpose.

28:05.142 --> 28:08.384
To rid it of all herbivious
life-forms.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.188
So what are you saying, spiky?

28:12.275 --> 28:14.982
Are you saying there used to be
plant-eating life here?

28:15.069 --> 28:16.855
Thousands of creatures.

28:16.946 --> 28:19.187
Plenty of food for my ancestors.

28:19.282 --> 28:21.193
Plenty of food.

28:21.284 --> 28:24.321
Until there was nothing.

28:27.415 --> 28:29.747
Br'nee's kind must have
known that

28:29.834 --> 28:32.291
your people would eventually
decimate the food supply.

28:32.378 --> 28:37.623
They expected us to do their
dirty work for them and
be long dead by now.

28:37.717 --> 28:41.335
Only their precious plants
would remain.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.887
How did you survive?

28:50.313 --> 28:51.052
M'Lee?

28:51.147 --> 28:53.559
(gasping softly)

28:53.649 --> 28:56.311
In the end, we only had
each other.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.938
And then Br'nee's people
arrived,

29:02.033 --> 29:03.614
and they became prey.

29:03.701 --> 29:05.692
l was hungry.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.619
As you are now.

29:13.836 --> 29:20.378
But I also know, after I
satisfy myself on your bones,

29:20.468 --> 29:23.210
and those of your friends
and finally, Br'nee,

29:23.304 --> 29:26.296
I will eventually starve
to death anyway.

29:27.224 --> 29:30.216
That's far enough.

29:30.311 --> 29:31.847
So what did you have in mind?

29:31.938 --> 29:34.224
I will control my hunger.

29:34.315 --> 29:38.479
And you will provide me access
to a more permanent food supply.

29:40.071 --> 29:44.781
You want me to take you with us?

29:44.867 --> 29:49.236
Br'nee knows where
my kind lives.

29:49.330 --> 29:53.494
Make him tell you, and then
take me there.

29:53.584 --> 29:57.418
You have got to be
kidding me, right?

30:01.050 --> 30:04.759
Deionization charge, complete.

30:04.845 --> 30:09.930
Direct composite capability,
enabled.

30:10.017 --> 30:14.226
Vaporization charge, imminent.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.684
Right. Here goes.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.157
Pilot:
That's done it.

30:32.248 --> 30:35.240
The cannon is active.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.495
I can't fully explain it, Pilot,

30:40.589 --> 30:43.581
but this ship and I seem to
have reached a bit of an
understanding.

30:43.676 --> 30:45.837
Moya, too, is encouraged.

30:45.928 --> 30:48.510
Communication with her
offspring is improving.

30:48.597 --> 30:51.259
She thanks you, Officer Sun.

30:51.350 --> 30:55.184
Amongst all these Peacekeeper
systems, lfeel quite at home.

30:55.271 --> 30:56.636
Rygel:
We couldn't be happier.

30:56.731 --> 30:59.723
Honestly. You deserve a home
where you're wanted.

31:02.153 --> 31:04.144
Pilot, I'll be returning to
Moya shortly.

31:04.238 --> 31:07.275
Please let me know if any
Peacekeeper scans are imminent.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.322
Maybe you ought to stay there.

31:09.410 --> 31:11.492
Maybe you and I ought to have a
little one on one when |
get back, Rygel.

31:11.579 --> 31:14.195
Look, if you've got a problem
with this then all you... Oh!

31:14.290 --> 31:16.155
You ought to keep one foot
out of your mouth.

31:16.250 --> 31:17.330
You may need it to run.

31:17.418 --> 31:18.749
(mumbles)

31:18.836 --> 31:22.203
Look, what slimy means is, uh,

31:22.298 --> 31:27.167
if we get attacked, the only
weapon we've got is that kid.

31:27.261 --> 31:33.507
lam not dragging this ship into
a conflict not of its making.

31:33.601 --> 31:36.843
Rygel:
Who said we had a choice?

31:42.234 --> 31:45.271
D'Argo:
You know, I'm not an enthusiast
of healers, but this remarkable.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.351
Feeling better?

31:46.447 --> 31:49.189
I am completely healed.

31:49.283 --> 31:50.989
My admiration, Br'nee.

31:51.077 --> 31:54.114
I've been prejudiced in the
past due to charlatans.

31:54.205 --> 31:57.038
Hmm, no offense taken.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.455
What are you doing here?

31:58.542 --> 32:00.533
Surprised I'm not M'Lee food?

32:00.628 --> 32:02.289
I mean, my work...

32:02.379 --> 32:07.544
Swamp Thing, here, ain't the
Mr. Rogers scientist we
thought he was!

32:07.635 --> 32:13.130
You forgot to mention how your
ancestors brought M'Lee's
people here, didn't you?!

32:13.224 --> 32:17.263
It was the only natural way
to protect what we were
growing here.

32:17.353 --> 32:20.891
M'Lee threw you a curve.
She survived.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.437
She slaughtered my mates!

32:22.525 --> 32:24.311
With good reason,
it sounds like.

32:24.401 --> 32:27.893
Once I get my research out I'll
come back with a larger
mission...

32:27.988 --> 32:29.649
She'll be dead by then.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.696
I cannot condone what
his people did,

32:31.784 --> 32:36.278
but for all this unparalleled
flora to flourish it may not be
entirely unreasonable...

32:36.372 --> 32:40.536
To murder sentient beings in
order to save a few
stinking plants?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.833
How animal-centric of you, John.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.126
Sorry, Zhaan.

32:45.214 --> 32:46.670
I forgot. You're a...

32:46.757 --> 32:48.258
I am a "stinking plant."

32:48.342 --> 32:49.673
Bpnee:
Myjuka!

32:49.760 --> 32:53.218
I have heard stories of the
existence of Delvians,

32:53.305 --> 32:55.170
but to actually stand in
the presence...

32:55.266 --> 32:57.302
D'Argo:
All right, enough.

32:57.393 --> 33:01.056
No offense, but I say we take
this tree hugger, shove him
out the access port

33:01.147 --> 33:02.683
and get the hezmana out of here.

33:02.773 --> 33:04.434
-Absolutely.
-I have charts!

33:04.525 --> 33:07.642
Charts that will take us
through the asteroid fields.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.146
All right, take me there.

33:09.238 --> 33:12.150
Zhaan:
No! John. Considering
the stakes, I'll go.

33:12.241 --> 33:16.701
I think, uh, under the
circumstances a cool head
behind that trigger.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.618
Wouldn't you agree?

33:20.374 --> 33:21.614
Be careful.

33:21.709 --> 33:23.245
|Wi||.

33:30.634 --> 33:34.343
My report to High Command.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.295
Shall I bother reading it?

33:36.390 --> 33:37.800
To what end?

33:37.892 --> 33:40.759
You'll hear it all multiple
times at your inquest.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.604
Disobeyed direct orders,

33:45.691 --> 33:48.398
murdered a fellow officer
with premeditation,

33:48.485 --> 33:54.981
sacrificed eighteen of your
elite crew in a pathetic quest
for personal vengeance.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.940
It's all in there.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.624
You are unfit for duty
by any measure.

34:05.711 --> 34:09.545
I personally intend to see you
stripped of rank and office.

34:09.632 --> 34:12.339
So you can take command
of my Carrier?

34:13.469 --> 34:15.209
I already have.

34:15.304 --> 34:17.545
Get off my ship!

34:52.424 --> 34:58.010
Why must you force me to
display my physical superiority
to your kind as well?

35:07.231 --> 35:10.849
If you want to fight anyone,

35:10.943 --> 35:13.901
attack your executioner.

35:17.324 --> 35:20.737
Zhaan! Br'nee! Time's up!

35:20.828 --> 35:23.786
Screw the happy plants, guys.
The transport's repaired.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.783
(groaning)

35:28.711 --> 35:30.167
What the hell happened?

35:30.254 --> 35:32.961
M'Lee surprised us.

35:33.048 --> 35:35.209
Took Zhaan.
I tried to fight her.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.257
She took Zhaan.
Did she take her alive?

35:37.344 --> 35:39.460
I'm not sure. I don't know.

35:39.555 --> 35:41.136
Where would she take her?

35:41.223 --> 35:44.636
Rock wall, where I saved
you from her.

35:48.731 --> 35:52.599
M'Lee! M'Lee!

35:53.861 --> 35:55.476
M'Lee!

35:55.571 --> 35:58.358
Where are you, you little
lying sack of spikes?

36:00.993 --> 36:02.949
You lied to me.

36:03.037 --> 36:04.277
You said you wouldn't hurt us.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.362
Said you weren't going to
eat any of us.

36:06.457 --> 36:09.369
Then you haul Zhaan off and...

36:14.340 --> 36:16.205
Bones.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.666
Son of a bit...

36:19.219 --> 36:20.379
Idiot!

36:36.070 --> 36:39.528
So, the baby's real dag-yo?

36:40.240 --> 36:42.071
Ah, yes.

36:42.159 --> 36:43.194
Whatever that means.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.741
Rygel:
Is he fast?

36:44.828 --> 36:47.240
A major part of his design and
function, I imagine.

36:47.331 --> 36:49.287
Faster than his mother?

36:49.375 --> 36:54.415
Yes, Rygel. Fast enough to take
you out of here if the
Peacekeepers get too close.

36:55.339 --> 36:57.876
Listen, someone should
escape this place.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.298
Carry our message to
the outside.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.922
And what exactly is
our message?

37:02.012 --> 37:04.219
Chiana:
That we don't want to
die out here.

37:04.306 --> 37:06.888
Very sensible.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.887
Chiana, would you come here
for a microt, please?

37:15.359 --> 37:17.395
Now let me get
something straight.

37:17.486 --> 37:19.317
Both of you.

37:19.405 --> 37:22.772
Moya will not leave here
without her offspring and he
will not leave without her.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.777
Where does that leave us?

37:24.868 --> 37:27.985
Very close to being thrown off
this command if you don't shut
your wakket hole.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.743
Any sign of Crichton,
Zhaan or D'Argo?

37:31.834 --> 37:33.290
Pilot's still checking.

37:33.377 --> 37:37.416
Good. Well if they're not here
in an am, we go and
look for them.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.006
We?

37:42.094 --> 37:44.380
She must mean you.

37:49.309 --> 37:52.221
Back already? You made good
time. Do you have the charts?

38:00.237 --> 38:03.229
Don't! Don't kill me! Please!

38:03.323 --> 38:07.316
I... l... I came... to talk.

38:07.411 --> 38:10.824
You're the no longer the
feral beast.

38:10.914 --> 38:13.200
That means...

38:13.292 --> 38:15.328
you've eaten.

38:20.382 --> 38:24.295
lwon't hurt you. I promise.

38:24.386 --> 38:28.129
I cannot guarantee the same for
you if you move towards me.

38:30.267 --> 38:32.178
What, uh...

38:32.269 --> 38:33.429
who did you eat?

38:33.520 --> 38:35.181
No one.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.978
Then why do you look like that?

38:37.065 --> 38:41.308
| used all my remaining calcium
to present myself in this way.

38:41.403 --> 38:42.563
Why?

38:42.654 --> 38:43.484
So...

38:43.572 --> 38:45.233
(gasping)

38:45.324 --> 38:47.155
( screaming )

38:47.242 --> 38:48.573
you... you...

38:48.660 --> 38:50.446
( screaming )

38:50.537 --> 38:52.243
you would listen.

38:52.331 --> 38:54.322
(gasping)

38:54.416 --> 38:57.749
I'm... I'm starving to death.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.918
( screaming )

39:01.215 --> 39:05.504
I must eat!

39:05.594 --> 39:08.961
You must take me with you

39:09.056 --> 39:12.344
or give me food!

39:12.434 --> 39:14.174
( screaming )

39:14.269 --> 39:15.600
I'm sorry.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.188
But I have nothing to offer you.

39:17.272 --> 39:20.014
(gasping)

39:20.108 --> 39:21.894
Please?

39:21.985 --> 39:24.192
Please, anything... anything.

39:24.279 --> 39:25.780
Except”

39:25.864 --> 39:29.448
there's a ship of beings
out there, thousands.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.947
No one will regret
their passing.

39:32.037 --> 39:35.450
You can have as many as
you can lay claim to.

39:35.541 --> 39:39.534
But... how do I...?

39:39.628 --> 39:42.210
How do I get there?

39:42.297 --> 39:44.288
They're coming soon.

39:44.383 --> 39:47.170
As soon as we start the engines
and blast off from here.

39:47.261 --> 39:52.176
Oh, you... you promise?

39:54.226 --> 39:56.342
Thousands.

39:58.397 --> 40:03.482
I... l... lwill... lwill
control my urge.

40:10.242 --> 40:13.325
So what's the plan, Br'nee?

40:13.412 --> 40:16.404
Find D'Argo, have him take you
to your home world?

40:16.498 --> 40:18.159
You're back.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.205
Yep.

40:19.293 --> 40:21.033
You look a lot better.

40:21.128 --> 40:24.996
Thank you. I ingested some
roots to repair my wounds.

40:25.090 --> 40:28.582
Yeah. Must be a lot of
interesting things in
these bottles.

40:28.677 --> 40:31.384
Did you get her?
Did you kill M'Lee?

40:31.471 --> 40:33.302
Nope.

40:33.390 --> 40:35.301
And Zhaan?

40:35.392 --> 40:36.973
Yeah, the blue plant.

40:37.060 --> 40:39.551
Aren't you supposed to
be looking for her?

40:39.646 --> 40:43.309
You know, it's funny.
Sometimes I'm very, very slow.

40:44.318 --> 40:46.309
Zhaan's a Delvian.

40:46.403 --> 40:48.143
Plant, right?

40:48.238 --> 40:50.354
Not animal?

40:50.449 --> 40:51.484
No bones.

40:51.575 --> 40:53.987
Fibers instead of bones, so...

40:54.077 --> 40:55.487
no calcium.

40:55.579 --> 41:00.915
Huh. And M'Lee's got
a great nose.

41:02.210 --> 41:06.044
So what would she
want with Zhaan?

41:08.383 --> 41:09.589
Where is she?

41:09.676 --> 41:10.916
What are you doing?

41:11.011 --> 41:12.922
You faked those injuries.
Where is she?!

41:13.013 --> 41:15.971
I don't know what you're
talking about.

41:16.058 --> 41:19.266
Now please, leave my
specimens alone.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.724
Zhaan.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.513
Okay, I can do this, Zhaan.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.101
I can do this.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.050
Damn, where's the button
on this thing?

42:02.145 --> 42:03.351
I can do it. I can do it.

42:03.438 --> 42:07.147
Step away from my machine.

42:09.653 --> 42:11.189
Why would you do this to her?

42:11.279 --> 42:13.895
She's a Delvian.

42:13.990 --> 42:17.653
I have lived over 200 cycles

42:17.744 --> 42:21.328
consumed by my life's work
as a botanist.

42:21.415 --> 42:30.005
Until today, I could only
dream of sampling such an
incredible species.

42:31.383 --> 42:33.374
She has a name.

42:34.845 --> 42:36.301
It's Zhaan.

42:36.388 --> 42:40.176
She is not dead, nor will
any harm come to her.

42:40.267 --> 42:42.883
She's in a test tube, Jack.

42:42.978 --> 42:49.395
Through her we might discover
medical cures even our future
dreamers dare not envision.

42:49.484 --> 42:53.193
Is that not a fair trade-off?

42:53.280 --> 42:55.111
Not to her.

42:55.490 --> 42:57.355
And not to me.

42:58.201 --> 43:00.362
I will shoot you.

43:01.621 --> 43:04.488
Nah, I don't think so.

43:04.583 --> 43:07.825
Not without the Chakan Oil
canndge.

43:10.172 --> 43:11.412
Run!

43:13.842 --> 43:16.083
She's mine!

43:26.938 --> 43:30.271
(gasping)

43:32.444 --> 43:34.230
What the hell am I looking at?

43:36.615 --> 43:38.355
Jusﬂce.

43:43.872 --> 43:45.237
You okay?

43:45.332 --> 43:47.414
Uh...

43:50.337 --> 43:52.248
Weird sensation.

43:55.050 --> 43:56.915
Thank you.

43:58.261 --> 43:59.842
Yeah.

44:01.765 --> 44:07.385
E.S.A.S. reports a confirmed
location on one of the escaped
Leviathan Transport Pods.

44:07.479 --> 44:10.642
It's landed on one of the
deep-field asteroids.

44:11.733 --> 44:13.348
Sir?

44:14.861 --> 44:16.397
Captain?

44:19.199 --> 44:25.695
Scorpius has ordered several
Marauder teams into the
asteroid field.

44:27.332 --> 44:29.288
Is it true what they say?

44:29.376 --> 44:33.415
That Scorpius can sense our
fears and our weaknesses?

44:34.548 --> 44:37.164
I await your orders, sir.

44:37.259 --> 44:39.966
My orders?

44:42.305 --> 44:46.048
Ah, do as he says.

44:59.364 --> 45:01.821
Zhaan, it's time.

45:04.077 --> 45:05.408
Come on.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.287
Crap! M'Lee.

45:14.087 --> 45:17.079
Starvation...

45:21.136 --> 45:25.049
M'Lee, dear, I wish
we could help you.

45:28.018 --> 45:31.351
Zhaan, we have to find a way
to take her with us
somehow, some way.

45:31.438 --> 45:36.478
No. Not unless you're willing
to sacrifice your shipmates
one at a time.

45:38.153 --> 45:44.194
D'Argo told me there were
others coming, called
Peacekeepers.

45:44.284 --> 45:47.367
I will try to hold on
until then.

45:48.330 --> 45:50.491
But I must eat something now!

45:51.958 --> 45:53.664
Bones.

45:53.752 --> 45:55.913
We have bones.

45:58.340 --> 45:59.876
Bpnee.

46:07.724 --> 46:10.136
(gnashing and ripping)

46:10.226 --> 46:14.185
There is much cruelty in the
universe.

46:14.272 --> 46:17.389
Yeah. We seem to have a
treasure map to it.

46:17.484 --> 46:20.317
(bones snapping and crunching)

46:20.403 --> 46:22.394
Bon appetit.

46:28.703 --> 46:31.695
Pilot:
The excellent trajectory charts
you've brought back

46:31.790 --> 46:35.783
will allow us to negotiate our
way out of this asteroid field.

46:35.877 --> 46:37.742
Thank you, Pilot.

46:39.798 --> 46:44.542
So, tell me about the baby.

46:44.636 --> 46:49.096
John, he's amazing,
and frightening.

46:49.182 --> 46:50.217
The technology...

46:50.308 --> 46:51.969
Zhaan:
It's such a waste.

46:52.060 --> 46:54.221
Aeryn:
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

46:54.312 --> 46:57.395
You'll find your way back
there, Zhaan, when insanity
isn't chasing you.

46:57.482 --> 47:01.441
I'll never be able to go back
there again and you know it.

47:01.528 --> 47:06.648
Then, those miracle plants will
be found by someone else.

47:06.741 --> 47:10.074
In the great scheme of things
it's all the same.

47:11.579 --> 47:13.410
Point well taken.

47:13.498 --> 47:16.831
When did our roles become
reversed, sweet D'Argo?

47:18.086 --> 47:19.872
When you required it.

47:19.963 --> 47:23.296
Chiana:
If your hand is still there
in one microt,

47:23.383 --> 47:27.217
I'll snap it off and use it as
a good luck charm.

47:27.303 --> 47:29.555
(murmuring)

47:32.225 --> 47:34.307
Officer Sun.

47:35.353 --> 47:37.218
Yes, Pilot?

47:37.313 --> 47:42.148
Moya has asked me to relay to
you how well she and her
offspring are communicating now.

47:42.235 --> 47:44.146
All thanks to you.

47:44.237 --> 47:47.479
Oh, Pilot, I did what I had to,
for the good of the ship.

47:47.574 --> 47:53.160
Well, the ship has notified me
that the offspring now
needs a name,

47:53.246 --> 47:57.205
and she would be extremely
honored if you, Aeryn Sun,

47:57.292 --> 47:59.704
were the one to choose
his name.

48:13.516 --> 48:18.180
I want a three-point grid
search of every square dench
of this asteroid.

48:18.271 --> 48:23.641
Report any scrap of evidence
you discover regarding the
fugitives directly to me.

48:23.735 --> 48:25.817
Sir.

48:25.904 --> 48:28.316
We found a survivor.

48:28.406 --> 48:32.649
She spent time with the
fugitives and may have
information that's useful to us.

48:33.536 --> 48:36.152
Please. Please, please,
please help me.

48:36.247 --> 48:37.783
I'm all alone here.

48:37.874 --> 48:40.081
They killed my family. Please.

48:40.168 --> 48:41.704
Please.

48:43.338 --> 48:47.877
We must know when to be strong,
and when to show compassion.

48:47.967 --> 48:51.300
Thank you. Thank you.

48:51.387 --> 48:53.002
As a matter of honor,

48:53.098 --> 49:00.345
sometimes we must be willing
to give of ourselves.
