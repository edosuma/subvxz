00:01.269 --> 00:02.970
- Today is gonna be a scorcher.

00:03.071 --> 00:04.538
It is so hot out here.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.940
I just bought this ice cream
two seconds ago, look at it.

00:07.041 --> 00:10.278
It's all melted.
So I'm out here in Riverside,

00:10.378 --> 00:13.514
and I feel like I'm
in Saudi Arabia right now.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.016
Been coming out here
to hit the black gold,

00:16.117 --> 00:17.451
expertise.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.121
I want to hit
the treasure chest today.

00:20.221 --> 00:24.392
Mmm, you get down to the fudge
at the bottom.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.630
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:29.730 --> 00:31.999
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:32.100 --> 00:33.501
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:33.601 --> 00:35.503
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:35.603 --> 00:36.837
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.172
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:38.272 --> 00:39.873
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:39.973 --> 00:41.409
- You shut your face.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.577
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:43.677 --> 00:44.745
- We're back, baby!

00:47.881 --> 00:49.783
- We're in Riverside today.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.420
And it is extremely hot.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.155
It's supposed to get over 100,

00:54.255 --> 00:56.190
so I really hope
my buyers come ready

00:56.290 --> 00:58.792
and the heat
doesn't scare 'em off.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.328
Can I do an auction
in my swimming suit?

01:00.428 --> 01:03.397
Actually I might
get a few more bids.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.367
- Girl, we are back
in California again.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.702
It's, like, non-stop.
Like, are we doing too much?

01:08.802 --> 01:09.937
- I don't think so.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.372
I just think our hubbies
are happy

01:11.472 --> 01:12.806
that we're actually
making money now.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.742
- For once.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.610
Let's kill it.

01:16.710 --> 01:17.745
- Look at this little breeze
we got.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.480
You can't ask for no more.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.483
- Yeah, I call this a breeze.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.851
- You take them shades off,

01:23.951 --> 01:25.519
you probably burn
all your eyelashes off.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.793
* Ankle broke,
ankle broke *

01:32.893 --> 01:34.662
- * Time to buy units

01:34.762 --> 01:36.864
* Ankle broke

01:36.964 --> 01:38.132
- Okay, I think Ivy saw you.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.034
- No, he didn't.
He didn't see me.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.736
- You can dance it off,
but I saw you almost fall.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.339
I told you he saw you.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.308
- Ooh!

01:47.408 --> 01:48.509
Is that how you do it?

01:48.609 --> 01:49.610
- Well, then.
- All right.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.512
Well, it was nice to see
you guys.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.046
- Okay.
Just so you know,

01:53.147 --> 01:54.748
it's cooler
when you don't wear black.

01:54.848 --> 01:55.949
- Ivy...

01:56.049 --> 01:57.251
- What are they
doing here again?

01:57.351 --> 01:58.986
I can't see over
these freaking girls.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.954
Look how tall they are.
I'm, like, five foot nothing.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.156
- You should wear some--
some wedges.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.124
- They're, like,
freaking six foot.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.593
I'm tiny,

02:05.693 --> 02:06.894
so I got a disadvantage
against these ladies.

02:06.994 --> 02:09.463
But I got friends
in high places.

02:09.563 --> 02:12.766
I just figured I would use
your knee for a step up.

02:12.866 --> 02:13.901
- I always got you, man.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.869
- Okay, yes, Ivy!

02:15.969 --> 02:17.938
You're the best,
my BFF forever.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.478
- I seen three Emilys.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.214
- All righty, guys,
my name is Emily.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.515
I'm gonna be your auctioneer.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.184
[Emily's voice distorting
indistinctly]

02:30.284 --> 02:32.553
...didn't realize it,
it is 100 degrees!

02:32.653 --> 02:33.954
I'm gonna open the door.
You can't go in,

02:34.054 --> 02:35.155
you can't touch anything,

02:35.256 --> 02:36.390
but you will all get
a chance to look,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.091
so if you guys are ready
to see the units,

02:38.192 --> 02:39.360
so am I.
Let's go!

02:39.460 --> 02:40.728
- Yeah!

02:40.828 --> 02:42.430
*

02:42.530 --> 02:43.897
- What are you looking
for today, Kenny?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.133
- I'm looking for
a air conditioner.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.701
- Yeah.

02:47.801 --> 02:48.836
*

02:48.936 --> 02:51.439
- Here we go, guys.
10 by 15.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.342
*

02:55.743 --> 02:57.511
*

02:57.611 --> 02:59.647
- Oh, this is nice,
just furnitures.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.249
Bag full of moneys.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.651
And the refrigermarator.

03:03.751 --> 03:04.952
I like this here unit.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.555
* I think we can make some money
on this *

03:07.655 --> 03:09.957
* Make some money on this

03:10.057 --> 03:11.559
* Yeah

03:11.659 --> 03:15.095
It's like "Titanic."

03:15.195 --> 03:16.997
- Oh, this one's gorgeous.

03:17.097 --> 03:20.501
So we got rugs, mattress.
This one's great.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.902
- It's absolutely beautiful.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.805
- Three matching there,
three matching there.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.575
Beautiful china cabinet,
refrigerator, TV,

03:27.675 --> 03:28.976
but I don't sell
this kind of stuff.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.478
I'm not even gonna lie,
I don't buy it,

03:30.578 --> 03:31.479
'cause I don't want to clean it,
make it look beautiful,

03:31.579 --> 03:32.913
and advertise it.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.683
- This furniture, antique,
little bit outdated...

03:35.783 --> 03:37.351
It's kind of hard to sell,
though,

03:37.451 --> 03:39.420
because of the style of it.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.489
I don't know,
I gotta think about it.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.391
- Here we go, guys,
let's get it rolling.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.393
I'm out 250.
- 250!

03:45.493 --> 03:48.429
- Here 250.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.199
400.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.802
450.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.037
550.
- Right here, girl.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.407
600.

03:59.507 --> 04:02.142
650, Kenny Ross.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.677
650, and now $700.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.750
Sold it to you, $650.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.219
- I think I got a good locker.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.955
Or maybe I have heat stroke
already.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.725
*

04:19.560 --> 04:24.398
*

04:24.498 --> 04:26.734
- The stove looks antique-ish.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.803
Hmm, this looks like it's been
in the desert.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.005
Yeah, no, pass.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.575
- Ivy, I need a boost.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.744
- Yes.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.313
- There's old school oven.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.814
And then a table.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.816
You know, there might be
some trinkets in here.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.585
- I don't really love
everything in here.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.219
Too much old dust and clothes.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.822
You good?
- Yeah, I'm good, thanks.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.558
- Look at that little table,
the chair.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.660
That table.
Ooh, ooh.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.796
- I know.
Look at the vintage frames.

04:55.896 --> 04:58.298
- This one might not be bad.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.967
- Yeah, it's hot.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.502
Are you delusional yet?

05:01.602 --> 05:03.671
- All right, guys, 5 by 12.
It's been here two years.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.907
What do you say? Nice little--

05:14.181 --> 05:15.849
- Yep.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.585
45 and 50.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.354
55 and 60.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.257
- Yep.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.359
- Now 65 and 70.

05:36.937 --> 05:41.174
- Oh.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.110
75, 80, now 85.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.045
85, 90.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.414
- Yeah.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.617
110, 110, 125.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.897
125.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.737
- Maybe if I just
let them have this one,

06:09.837 --> 06:11.104
they'll be done for the day.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.272
- 135.
Mary, you want back in?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.008
- Nah.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.544
- Sold it to ya, girls.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.779
Edwina and Shana
win it for 125.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.281
- Yeah!

06:21.381 --> 06:23.617
*

06:23.717 --> 06:26.420
- Got to watch Mary.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.622
- 10 by 15, here we go.

06:28.722 --> 06:32.693
*

06:32.793 --> 06:34.462
- Ivy!

06:34.562 --> 06:36.196
- I gotta see in the back.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.534
It's like
my own little forklift.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.770
- There's a vintage-y pillow,

06:42.870 --> 06:45.473
and then that's
a cool table base right there.

06:45.573 --> 06:46.874
It looks promising.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.409
- Thanks, Ivy.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.245
- Really like the picnic table
right there.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.381
Looks like we got a chair right
there under the blanket.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.016
Two nice fans in there.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.151
Eh, if it goes low, I'm in.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.720
If it goes high,
I'm out.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.421
- That table is gorgeous.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.923
If somebody got it, I would buy
that table off 'em.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.592
- You know how good the wicker
would look?

07:04.692 --> 07:06.694
- Aw, that's our backyard
right there.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.297
*

07:10.397 --> 07:12.065
- I like the lawn chair.
- Looks good.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.734
- I like the washer and dryer.
- Mm-hmm, me too.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.335
Oh, yeah.
- I'm loving that table.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.637
- Oh, I love that table.

07:16.737 --> 07:20.541
- * Guess who's gonna bid
on this one *

07:20.641 --> 07:22.375
* Oh, you gotta be joking
right now *

07:22.476 --> 07:24.978
- 300, 300, 300.
- * I'm going 100

07:25.078 --> 07:26.814
- Kenny.
- * Come on

07:26.914 --> 07:28.949
- This thing's gonna go
for at least 300.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.351
Doesn't he want to get out
of the heat, too?

07:31.451 --> 07:35.355
- I just hope that those two
Vegas girls don't like it,

07:35.455 --> 07:38.892
because they're cramping
my style, okay?

07:38.992 --> 07:41.061
- Good stuff here,
and how about 200?

07:41.161 --> 07:42.730
And now 250, thank you.

07:49.670 --> 07:53.240
550.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.346
650, now 700.

07:59.446 --> 08:03.617
750, 750.

08:07.888 --> 08:11.158
900.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.494
950.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.763
950, Ivy, you're out.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.431
Yes or no, 950?

08:18.532 --> 08:20.433
950, 950.
Sold it to ya, Mary.

08:20.534 --> 08:23.036
$900, she gets it for 900.

08:23.136 --> 08:26.139
- No more lifts.
!

08:26.239 --> 08:27.608
- Snap.
- No more lifts.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.609
- Oh, my God.
- Now you gotta jump.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.943
Now you gotta jump.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.178
Now you gotta jump.
- You're a bad sport.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.179
- Now you gotta jump.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.180
- Eh, whatever.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.715
He'll get over it.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.183
- All righty, guys, thank you so
much for sticking with me.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.351
I know it was really hot.
Thanks for bidding quick.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.087
See you next time.
Come meet me in the office

08:40.187 --> 08:41.454
and pay your bill.
Thanks!

08:41.555 --> 08:44.424
- Oh, man, hour and a half,
and no unit?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.459
You know whose fault it was?
- Don't blame it on me.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.028
- No, I'm blaming it on Mary.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.496
The one for her--

08:49.597 --> 08:50.898
- I lifted her up twice
for nothing,

08:50.998 --> 08:52.199
then she bids the one I wanted.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.201
*

08:54.301 --> 08:55.703
- Okay.
- 875.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.105
I'm so excited.
This is our new lucky number.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.774
*

09:00.874 --> 09:02.475
- Okay.
- All right.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.711
- A purseholder.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.813
- Yes, got our own little
purseholder here.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.781
- Oh, my gosh,
look at this rock.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.083
- Crystal. You know
how expensive these can be?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.819
- These are really cool.
- These are beautiful.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.023
- This table...
- Ooh, is gorgeous.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.725
- Gorgeous.
- Bring that out.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.327
- Oh, look at the little lions
on the corners.

09:20.427 --> 09:24.264
- Ooh. Let me see if
there's anything under.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.166
The nails on there
are old as crap.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.367
This one's a winner.
- All right.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.036
Can get like 50 bucks for this.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.339
We got some Levis.
We'll want to bedazzle these.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.107
- After we're done with it,
this is 30 bucks.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.910
I must say, Edwina,

09:37.010 --> 09:38.812
this chair has my heart!

09:38.912 --> 09:41.181
- Oh, it does!
Look.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.351
This is cute.
- I would love to re-do this.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.753
Could do, like, a velvet
for the heart.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.254
- Girl, done.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.789
- Here's the other chair, girl.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.523
- I know, now we have a set.
- It's a set!

09:50.624 --> 09:52.259
For $45.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.962
Stove, which is
in great condition.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.931
Oh, it's an O'Keefe!
- Oh, my God.

09:58.031 --> 10:01.101
- Girl, you can make biscuits
at 450 degrees.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.602
It tells you
how to make muffins,

10:02.703 --> 10:04.504
cornbread, and nut bread.
- Oh, my God.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.440
I don't even think this
has been used; look at it.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.843
It's in great shape!
This is 350.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.379
I don't think we could ask
for a better locker.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.815
- No, the surprises
keep on coming.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.784
- All right, let's see
what that is.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.787
*

10:19.887 --> 10:22.189
- Shana, look.
Both: Royal Hawaiian.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.456
*

10:23.556 --> 10:25.025
- I don't know about
Royal Hawaiian.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.326
- Me either.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.662
Why are these wrapped up
like this?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.597
- I mean,
they're gorgeous patterns.

10:30.698 --> 10:33.133
- Made in Honolulu.
Interesting.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.705
Both: Catalina.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.407
- This last one...
Again, Catalina.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.609
- Normally a Hawaiian shirt
is not in a nice garment bag.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.277
- Right, in a suit bag.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.279
Well, these are wrapped up
like this.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.981
You already know
what time it is.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.583
We're getting these
checked out.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.953
Both: Ooh.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.055
- I'm here for my meeting.

10:57.925 --> 11:02.362
both: Ohh...

11:04.297 --> 11:05.933
No,
they're patterns from the '70s!

11:06.033 --> 11:09.002
- She's letting 'em have it.
Look at this, for winter.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.670
- Wait, is this
our inspiration box?

11:10.771 --> 11:12.172
- Uh, this is all the clothes
we're gonna wear in the winter.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.007
We're gonna sew 'em up.
- Oh, my gosh.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.542
- Oh, my God,
look at these old fabrics.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.210
- Oh, my gosh, look at these
dresses; they're stunning.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.279
Look at this poncho!

11:19.379 --> 11:21.448
- I know, these are amazing.
Look it, this is like Twiggy.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.717
Vintage materials and patterns.
Girl...

11:23.817 --> 11:27.120
- Oh, my gosh, this you could
sell for 50 bucks.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.722
- Yes, this is a winner.

11:28.822 --> 11:29.723
- All right.
- Put it over there.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.458
- Done, keep it.

11:31.558 --> 11:36.730
This might have been our easiest
and most successful unit yet.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.901
- Let's see what we've got here.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.770
*

11:42.870 --> 11:44.404
Whoo!

11:44.504 --> 11:46.373
Let's start off
with the chairs here.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.376
How you doing?
- Hey.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.511
- You took the time out
in this damn heat

11:51.611 --> 11:53.013
to come and see if I'm okay?

11:53.113 --> 11:54.147
- Of course, Kenny.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.615
- That's why I love you,
homegirl.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.417
You really do care about me.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.286
You like them chairs?
- Yeah.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.421
You know, if you fix 'em up...

12:01.521 --> 12:02.756
- Ten bucks a piece.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.357
- Oooh.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.860
- I don't know nothing about
this vintage stuff right here.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.595
- I think it's Victorian style.

12:08.695 --> 12:12.399
They did a lot of woodcarvings
with floral design.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.567
- Ooh, look what it says,
made in Italy.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.003
- Oh, yeah, that's snazzy.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.105
- I'm glad Mary's here,

12:18.205 --> 12:21.241
'cause I don't know nothing
about this here fancy furniture.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.077
So what do you think, Mary?
I got the chair,

12:24.177 --> 12:26.479
the couch,
and a loveseat.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.281
- I mean, if it's all there,

12:28.381 --> 12:30.150
probably get up to 1,000 bucks
for this set.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.652
- That's why I love you,
southern girl.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.587
- Totally.
- My homey forever.

12:34.687 --> 12:35.923
- Yeah, and I'd love to stay,

12:36.023 --> 12:38.158
but I gotta go estimate
my own locker.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.626
- All right.
- Wish me luck.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.028
- Peace in the Middle East.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.496
*

12:43.596 --> 12:45.398
- So I was worried
about those Vegas ladies,

12:45.498 --> 12:47.935
but I managed to get
a good unit.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.971
Okay, tea towels.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.606
Coffeemaker, some knives...

12:53.706 --> 12:55.809
Nothing that I can sell.

12:55.909 --> 12:59.312
Here's a little light,
probably sell for five bucks.

12:59.412 --> 13:03.116
Some little baskets...
$5 each for these things.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.953
Foldable exercise
thingymajiggy.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.488
And you can work out
while you watch TV.

13:08.588 --> 13:09.890
What's better than that?

13:09.990 --> 13:12.025
Uh, making money's
better than that.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.561
Old shower stuff...

13:16.029 --> 13:18.565
For old people to go
to the bathroom.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.033
Ew.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.702
Yep, so, so far...

13:22.802 --> 13:24.437
Not looking too good.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.173
*

13:26.273 --> 13:28.708
- Nice shirt, and this stuff
right in here,

13:28.808 --> 13:30.677
probably get 50 bucks.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.445
Glassware and bowls,

13:32.545 --> 13:35.148
I'd say about $50 worth
of stuff in here.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.218
This is nice.
I've got three boxes.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.954
Probably go like $50 a box
right here.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.823
What's this?
Cowboy .

13:43.924 --> 13:45.825
Right here, I don't know
what this is.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.494
But it might be worth something.

13:47.594 --> 13:51.264
I'll put it to the side.
Hey, look at this.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.533
Looks like something
you'd see on "Gunsmoke."

13:53.633 --> 13:55.969
Hmm, some hats.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.838
We got the hat
and we got the boots.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.740
Nice little cowboy right here.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.809
Nice little gun holster.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.411
This thing's real leather.

14:04.511 --> 14:08.015
This old cowboy stuff might
could be worth some bucks.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.183
Giddy-up.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.818
Nice little stove here.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.721
Say about a good 100 bucks
right here.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.323
Refrigerator.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.358
Clean!
Look at that, boy.

14:18.458 --> 14:22.029
Say about $75
for the refrigerator.

14:22.129 --> 14:25.332
I got a nice little television,
a Samsung.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.633
25 bucks.

14:26.733 --> 14:29.102
Got a nice little dinette
cabinet back here.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.104
Looks like in good condition.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.506
Probably say about 150 bucks
for that.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.176
Got nice magic carpets,
two of these,

14:36.276 --> 14:38.545
probably about $50 a piece.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.114
Crusty plush mattress
like Mary said.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.950
Nobody wants that.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.784
Oh, my God.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.120
I'ma take my old fancy-ass
cowboy gear

14:47.220 --> 14:48.588
and see what it's worth.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.291
And I'm about to head off--
ooh, this  hot.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.161
, damn!
It was sitting in the sun.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.730
Cast iron.

14:57.830 --> 15:01.068
- So I'm halfway through,
made about 500 bucks.

15:01.168 --> 15:04.504
I'm hoping that in this corner
there are some priceable items

15:04.604 --> 15:08.741
because this stuff
ain't gonna cut it, okay?

15:08.841 --> 15:10.843
This bin, five bucks.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.645
This bin is crusty plush.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.082
This bin, just papers, nothing.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.384
And crusty plush and nothing.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.120
Little shelf thingymajiggy.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.922
Has the price tag on it,
20 bucks.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.158
This little wicker table
is cute.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.360
I'm gonna say 25 bucks.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.230
This thing is nice, just clean
up the cushion a little bit.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.898
15 bucks.

15:31.999 --> 15:35.935
Here's a cute little
wicker chair.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.437
20 bucks.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.473
Here's a cute little
wicker loveseat.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.442
*

15:42.542 --> 15:43.910
Here we go.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.379
Kenny!

15:46.479 --> 15:48.481
Look at you.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.450
You came just in time.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.419
- Yeah.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.388
- Okay, these chairs are nice.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.258
20 bucks each.
- Flat screen.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.526
- 50 bucks for that one,
you think?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.995
- Yeah.
- Then 20 bucks for this one.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.831
- Mm-hmm.
- 15 bucks for the chair.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.966
- This is nice,
outside picnic table.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.801
- This is cute.
- Put a lot of sandwiches

16:08.901 --> 16:10.337
and snack food.
- Sandwiches, yeah!

16:10.437 --> 16:12.339
I'm gonna say 75 bucks.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.541
- How much for the washer
and dryer, girl?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.809
- 250 each.
- Yeah.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.511
- This locker didn't have
any trinkets

16:18.611 --> 16:20.313
or anything cool
to get checked out,

16:20.413 --> 16:24.251
but I made my money back
and made a tiny Mary profit.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.653
- What about a Slurpie
right now?

16:26.753 --> 16:31.258
- Slurpies are always good.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.361
- We're arriving at
re Aloha shirts...

16:34.461 --> 16:35.995
A whole store dedicated
to shirts, really?

16:37.097 --> 16:38.631
- To meet this dude named Crash.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.000
- Aloha!
- Aloha!

16:41.101 --> 16:42.669
- I'm good.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.405
- We're hoping to say aloha
to some moola.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.774
- When we saw these, we thought
they were something special.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.876
- Wow.
- I thought all Hawaiian shirts

16:49.976 --> 16:52.112
were short sleeve.
- Apparently it gets cold.

16:52.212 --> 16:55.014
- Well, they have
long sleeve shirts.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.616
These were considered
dress shirts.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.251
- They stand out,

16:58.351 --> 16:59.519
compared to the stuff today,

16:59.619 --> 17:01.754
which tends to be
a little subdued.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.324
- Yeah.
- The colors here are very good.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.826
Wow, look at this.

17:06.926 --> 17:09.229
These are actually
coconut buttons.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.399
- Yes, they actually make
coconut buttons.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.800
'cause you look at the shirt

17:13.900 --> 17:15.602
and you just want
to feel the aloha.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.871
- Right.
- Now this one is Catalina.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.573
- When we saw the label,
we knew it was vintage.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.609
- This shirt was actually made
in California.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.943
- Hollywood.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.279
- Sometime in the '50s
most likely.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.614
- Maybe somebody famous
wore this.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.915
- Could be.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.417
- All right, we have one more.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.518
- All right, let's see it.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.321
Wow, another Catalina.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.888
This is what they call
a cabana shirt.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.625
So these are cabana pockets.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.261
Like, to hold, like, a beer?
- Their hands, like this.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.995
- Really, they held their hands
like that?

17:43.096 --> 17:44.764
- Yeah.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.799
- They weren't really
meant for use,

17:46.899 --> 17:49.702
'cause, you know, otherwise,
they would totally be sagged.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.704
- Okay, you schooled us.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.906
We have to know,
what are they worth?

17:54.006 --> 17:58.345
- Well, this one's got a little
bit of wear on the collar.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.313
- Somebody needed mothballs
in their closet.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.315
- Well, no,
moths don't like rayon,

18:02.415 --> 18:04.284
but they probably
had a hairy neck.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.187
- Hairy neck damage, yes.

18:07.287 --> 18:10.123
But even with the damage,
I would say

18:10.223 --> 18:12.925
you could probably get about
$100 for this shirt.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.561
- I told you!

18:14.661 --> 18:17.364
- Okay, now this shirt's in
very good condition.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.333
I would say probably about $75.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.034
- Not bad.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.372
- And this last one, this is
your best piece right here.

18:25.472 --> 18:29.209
Because it's a '50s rayon
and they're very rare.

18:29.309 --> 18:33.380
You know, I would
probably say...

18:33.480 --> 18:35.315
About 150 for this shirt.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.187
I see you like this shirt; you
would look good in this shirt.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.589
- Mm-hmm.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.791
- I've got so many shirts.

18:47.026 --> 18:47.927
- Dennis!

18:48.027 --> 18:49.196
I moseyed on up

18:49.296 --> 18:51.731
to go see Dennis
at Barnyard Antiques.

18:51.831 --> 18:52.999
*

18:56.203 --> 18:58.471
Did this dude just come out
of the toilet?

18:58.571 --> 19:01.741
- This is heavy leather,
nice tooling.

19:01.841 --> 19:05.478
A .45, 4 inch barrel would
fit in there real nice.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.747
I have an idea this was
made in Colorado.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.082
- How you know it was
made in Colorado?

19:10.183 --> 19:11.851
- Um, here, look here,

19:11.951 --> 19:13.085
there's something in here.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.255
It says H. H. Heiser.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.923
Made in Denver, Colorado.

19:17.023 --> 19:19.292
What you got on here?

19:19.392 --> 19:20.693
- I don't know,
I see something here.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.595
This looks like a doorstop.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.397
It's beautiful, though.
- Yeah.

19:24.497 --> 19:28.501
- 1930, it's got all
the original paint on it.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.102
It's a prairie wagon.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.338
- Little house on the prairie.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.206
- Little house on the prairie,
yeah.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.009
Tell me about this
right here, Dennis.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.412
- Okay, that's an ox yoke.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.081
This dropped down over the top
of their head.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.551
You hooked your wagon
down here to this.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.920
- Oh, all right.
- Nice piece.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.222
- So tell me, how much for

19:49.322 --> 19:51.558
the whole cowboy starter kit
right here?

19:51.658 --> 19:54.427
- Well, let's see here...

19:54.527 --> 19:59.131
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

19:59.232 --> 20:01.434
- All right, now, that's what
I'm talking about right here.

20:01.534 --> 20:05.605
- Seven, eight, nine, ten,
11, 12...

20:05.705 --> 20:07.474
*

20:07.574 --> 20:08.975
- Hear Benjamin talking.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.844
*

20:11.944 --> 20:14.414
- You got yourself
a deal there, sir.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.584
Pew, pew, promenade!

20:17.684 --> 20:20.987
Narrator: City slicker
Kenny Crosley rounded up

20:21.087 --> 20:23.690
a chic $2,500.

20:23.790 --> 20:28.428
Edwina and Shana stitched
together 735 coconuts.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.664
Mary Padian had friends
in high places,

20:31.764 --> 20:34.200
but profits in low margins.

20:34.301 --> 20:37.604
While Ivy Calvin couldn't get
his own leg up

20:37.704 --> 20:39.406
on the competition.

20:39.506 --> 20:43.943
- I moseyed on up to go see
Dennis at Barnyard Antiques

20:44.043 --> 20:47.947
to get these here cowboy things
looked at.

20:48.047 --> 20:51.551
Ooh, sorry.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.986
Sorry, my bad, my bad.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.122
It went on my shirt.
- Got nothing on that one.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.525
- I'm sorry, did you see that
come out my mouth?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.760
- Oh, yeah.
- No.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.362
I'm sorry.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.796
Don't air that one part.
