02:32.818 --> 02:34.219
Sorry I'm late,

02:36.222 --> 02:37.290
but I was thinking.

02:38.657 --> 02:39.655
Looks good, Ter.

02:39.657 --> 02:41.160
What is this supposed to be?

02:42.294 --> 02:43.396
It's the house.

02:49.435 --> 02:52.437
And this is Kate.

02:55.574 --> 02:56.643
Sit down, Terry.

03:00.278 --> 03:02.446
You said you were thinking?

03:02.448 --> 03:04.013
Yeah.

03:04.015 --> 03:05.681
Yes.

03:05.683 --> 03:06.552
Okay.

03:07.485 --> 03:08.655
So here's the deal.

03:09.722 --> 03:12.422
We have four girls staying over.

03:12.424 --> 03:13.756
Initially I thought,
that's great.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.792
Four girls for Kate.

03:15.794 --> 03:18.298
Then I remembered all
of your beautiful faces.

03:19.431 --> 03:20.262
I don't want to starve
you of the action,

03:20.264 --> 03:22.367
but I have to have
the first kill.

03:23.368 --> 03:24.403
Call it a quirk.

03:25.704 --> 03:27.571
So I'll kick off the
festivities by going in alone.

03:27.573 --> 03:30.340
Say 10:00, 10:30.

03:30.342 --> 03:32.542
At this point, they'll
be knee deep in champagne

03:32.544 --> 03:34.278
and gone.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.747
Feeling it big time.

03:37.650 --> 03:42.286
One of them, perhaps the
tallest, will be parched.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.353
She'll want water.

03:44.355 --> 03:46.356
I know this place like
the back of my hand,

03:46.358 --> 03:48.491
and I can fit inside
the refrigerator...

03:48.493 --> 03:49.726
Nope.

03:49.728 --> 03:51.328
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.029
I can't.

03:52.031 --> 03:54.364
I mean, this is bad.

03:54.366 --> 03:55.301
What do you mean?

03:56.301 --> 03:58.000
I mean, this is bad.

03:58.002 --> 03:59.335
Your plan is bad.

03:59.337 --> 04:00.169
The model is bad, it's all bad...

04:00.171 --> 04:02.405
The model was
for effect, Jimmy.

04:02.407 --> 04:03.775
I just smashed it.

04:05.477 --> 04:06.709
Do you got a better idea?

04:06.711 --> 04:07.977
- Well, you know...
- Oh, look out, everyone.

04:07.979 --> 04:09.546
- Here comes Jimmy.
- Hey, hey, hey.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.549
Fine, I don't have
a better idea.

04:13.551 --> 04:15.018
Happy?

04:15.020 --> 04:16.519
Look, I know I've
said this before

04:16.521 --> 04:18.954
but I think it bears
repeating in this moment.

04:18.956 --> 04:19.956
I have huge concerns

04:19.958 --> 04:21.457
- about this whole thing.
- Fuck.

04:21.459 --> 04:23.028
Nobody else, I'm alone?

04:24.862 --> 04:29.800
I'm talking about crippling
cosmic concerns, Dad.

04:29.802 --> 04:32.305
We're dealing
with professionals.

04:34.639 --> 04:37.406
These two?

04:40.079 --> 04:41.110
What about the family name, huh?

04:42.047 --> 04:43.480
Nobody's thought of that?

04:43.482 --> 04:44.848
I mean, even if we
get away with this,

04:44.850 --> 04:47.851
this is going to
follow us forever.

04:47.853 --> 04:49.952
You don't think that at all?

04:49.954 --> 04:52.356
Karma, have you
thought about karma?

04:52.358 --> 04:53.022
It's true.

04:53.024 --> 04:54.358
What goes around

04:54.360 --> 04:55.459
- comes around, okay?
- Yeah, yeah!

04:55.461 --> 05:00.300
And we are sending an
awful lot around with this.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.733
And when it comes back, and
it's going to come back,

05:02.735 --> 05:04.401
it's coming back and
it's gonna hit us

05:04.403 --> 05:05.668
like a ton of bricks,

05:05.670 --> 05:06.702
because we aren't
going to be ready

05:06.704 --> 05:08.437
because we're sending out a lot

05:08.439 --> 05:09.873
and it's coming back to hit
us right in the face, okay.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.474
Because what goes out
there, comes back...

05:11.476 --> 05:12.675
What the fuck is
he talking about?

05:12.677 --> 05:13.877
Hey, hey, you know what?

05:13.879 --> 05:14.978
Nobody can get a thought out

05:14.980 --> 05:15.846
when you keep
interrupting everyone...

05:15.848 --> 05:17.046
Only you.

05:17.048 --> 05:18.048
- Yeah, yeah, well stop it.
- I'm only interrupting you

05:18.050 --> 05:19.115
and I should be getting
a Nobel Prize for it.

05:19.117 --> 05:20.817
They don't give out
Nobel Prizes for things...

05:20.819 --> 05:22.385
Well whatever fucking...

05:22.387 --> 05:23.486
Stop!

05:28.994 --> 05:31.097
We're all on the same team,

05:32.029 --> 05:34.900
so just relax and listen up.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.903
This is what's gonna happen.

06:34.526 --> 06:35.360
Uh.

06:37.028 --> 06:38.461
What do you want me
to do about that?

06:38.463 --> 06:39.796
Be creative.

06:39.798 --> 06:41.964
Take me to Red Lobster.

06:41.966 --> 06:42.834
Okay.

06:43.769 --> 06:45.101
Yeah, I can definitely
make reservations.

06:45.103 --> 06:46.506
Wait, really?

06:47.139 --> 06:48.538
This is our first date,

06:48.540 --> 06:50.873
and you're gonna take
me to Red Lobster?

06:50.875 --> 06:53.678
Did you just ask me on a date?

07:01.887 --> 07:02.754
- Dude.
- Hmm?

07:03.822 --> 07:05.255
Do something.

07:05.257 --> 07:08.224
Ask me what kind of
food I like to eat.

07:08.226 --> 07:10.627
Or when is good for me

07:10.629 --> 07:12.195
- to go.
- Oh, oh yeah.

07:12.197 --> 07:13.064
Okay.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.733
When is good for you?

07:16.735 --> 07:18.000
Next weekend?

07:18.002 --> 07:18.870
Next weekend?

07:20.738 --> 07:21.837
That is awesome

07:21.839 --> 07:23.940
We can, uh, yeah.

07:23.942 --> 07:25.175
Great.

07:25.177 --> 07:27.879
By chance, what are
you doing tomorrow?

07:28.913 --> 07:31.113
Uh, tomorrow's Halloween.

07:31.115 --> 07:32.117
Yeah, it is.

07:33.050 --> 07:35.151
It's awesome, isn't it?

07:35.153 --> 07:38.622
I have never really been
a fan of themed parties,

07:38.624 --> 07:42.659
and Halloween is
like a themed day,

07:42.661 --> 07:44.728
except the theme
is, like, witches

07:44.730 --> 07:46.195
and goblins and scary things.

07:46.197 --> 07:48.598
But like why?

07:48.600 --> 07:49.469
You know?

07:50.836 --> 07:53.269
Yeah, uh, mm-hm.

07:53.271 --> 07:57.307
But look, if you wanna
go, that's totally cool.

07:57.309 --> 07:58.511
I can make an exception.

07:59.944 --> 08:00.812
No, no,

08:02.213 --> 08:03.312
That's okay.

08:03.314 --> 08:04.848
Next weekend will be great.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.750
Okay, I'll let you
choose where we go.

08:07.752 --> 08:10.654
Well then, we will
go to Red Lobster.

08:11.990 --> 08:12.856
Perfect!

08:12.858 --> 08:14.658
Nah, I'm kidding.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.594
But they really do
have delicious rolls.

08:17.596 --> 08:18.865
I'll take your word for it.

08:20.966 --> 08:21.901
I'm really excited.

08:23.035 --> 08:23.903
Me too.

08:25.836 --> 08:26.838
Okay, bye.

09:23.629 --> 09:25.898
So, how's work?

09:27.698 --> 09:29.601
Today was really
good, actually.

09:31.035 --> 09:32.337
It's a big day tomorrow.

09:33.270 --> 09:35.338
I hope you got her a nice gift.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.576
Dad, please, let's
not do this again.

09:38.777 --> 09:40.613
Your sister's
getting married, Kate.

09:41.846 --> 09:44.381
I have plans.

09:44.383 --> 09:45.251
Really?

09:47.019 --> 09:48.017
What plans?

09:48.019 --> 09:49.621
I'm surprising
my friend Trent.

09:51.222 --> 09:52.091
Okay.

09:53.024 --> 09:54.891
Who the hell is Trent?

09:54.893 --> 09:57.761
Well, he's a friend from work.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.331
We've known each
other for a while.

10:02.033 --> 10:03.702
I really like him, Dad.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.704
I planned this whole
thing on the way over.

10:07.706 --> 10:09.805
- Tomorrow's Halloween...
- Oh, wow, really?

10:09.807 --> 10:10.676
Halloween?

10:13.879 --> 10:15.244
It's his favorite holiday.

10:15.246 --> 10:16.945
You're gonna have
plenty of opportunities

10:16.947 --> 10:18.116
to dress up with Trent.

10:19.283 --> 10:21.151
Angie's only getting
married once.

10:21.153 --> 10:22.321
That's optimistic.

10:23.754 --> 10:25.758
Angie really needs
you there tomorrow.

10:28.092 --> 10:29.092
Dad, I just...

10:29.094 --> 10:31.261
I can't live with a
fractured family, Kate.

10:31.263 --> 10:34.797
I would like to spend
whatever time I have left

10:34.799 --> 10:35.834
with my girls.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.804
She could make an effort
every once in a while, too.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.307
She sent you invitation.

10:46.778 --> 10:47.913
Okay, just...

10:49.715 --> 10:51.980
Do whatever you want, it's
okay, do what you want.

10:51.982 --> 10:52.851
Dad.

10:54.385 --> 10:55.254
Dad.

10:59.957 --> 11:00.826
I'm tired.

11:03.195 --> 11:06.799
I'm not lying, I
really am just tired.

11:13.938 --> 11:14.807
I love you.

11:18.176 --> 11:19.278
I love you, too.

11:22.147 --> 11:23.979
Think of your family.

11:23.981 --> 11:25.150
I don't ask much.

11:27.519 --> 11:28.387
Kate.

11:29.955 --> 11:31.389
Get her something nice.

12:03.922 --> 12:06.089
Hi!

12:26.845 --> 12:27.513
Hi.

12:28.413 --> 12:29.246
What happened?

12:31.015 --> 12:32.916
I must be in a bad
area or something.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.086
Oh, weird.

12:35.386 --> 12:37.052
Hi!

12:37.054 --> 12:37.923
Hi.

12:39.957 --> 12:41.961
Are you coming?
Tell me you're coming.

12:43.861 --> 12:47.129
- Yes.
- Oh, my god, that's amazing.

12:47.131 --> 12:48.767
I'm so excited, Kate.

12:50.601 --> 12:53.069
Yeah, so how do
I get up there?

12:53.071 --> 12:55.204
We'll pick you up tomorrow.

12:55.206 --> 12:57.442
I knew you'd come, I knew it.

12:58.909 --> 13:01.477
I can't believe my little
sister is getting married.

13:01.479 --> 13:02.478
Believe it.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.148
You'll love him, too,
he's smart and handsome,

13:06.150 --> 13:10.054
and he's funny in a way that
you'll appreciate, I hope.

13:11.255 --> 13:13.156
We'll pick you up
tomorrow at 11AM.

13:13.158 --> 13:14.058
Sounds great.

13:15.927 --> 13:18.460
- I'll see you then.
- 11AM.

13:18.462 --> 13:20.095
- Perfect.
- Bye!

13:20.097 --> 13:20.966
Bye.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.579
- Poison.
- Okay.

13:36.581 --> 13:39.350
Transfers to the
champagne bottle.

13:40.918 --> 13:44.253
And then they start
popping bottles and ah-ha.

13:44.255 --> 13:47.125
Okay, how do we get the
cork back into the bottle?

13:49.193 --> 13:51.326
- I fucked it up again.
- There's no fucking up.

13:51.328 --> 13:53.595
We're just
brainstorming here, so...

13:53.597 --> 13:56.165
Okay, brainstorming,
what if we take this...

13:56.167 --> 13:57.432
Where did you get that?

13:57.434 --> 13:58.901
This is how I give
Lucy her medication.

13:58.903 --> 14:02.070
- Our cat has diabetes?
- For like seven years.

14:02.072 --> 14:03.573
Three times a day
I have to do this.

14:03.575 --> 14:05.941
Okay, so let's say I take the
poison, put it into the cork,

14:05.943 --> 14:09.244
we let it drain in, that way
the cork is not distressed,

14:09.246 --> 14:11.013
it falls in, sneak attack.

14:11.015 --> 14:13.449
My concern is, can I
see this for a second?

14:13.451 --> 14:15.919
- See how small that is?
- I'm not a scientist.

14:15.921 --> 14:19.388
- You said brainstorming.
- Okay, well, I mean...

14:19.390 --> 14:23.660
Is there a way that we
can leave the cork in,

14:23.662 --> 14:25.994
leave the gold wrapping so
that doesn't get touched,

14:25.996 --> 14:30.967
- but we go through the glass?
- Can I ask you something?

14:30.969 --> 14:31.968
Yeah.

14:31.970 --> 14:36.305
Do you think Dad was
mad or embarrassed of me

14:36.307 --> 14:37.973
'cause I started
sobbing at the meeting?

14:37.975 --> 14:41.044
Hey hey, don't worry about
Dad, nobody's mad at you, okay?

14:41.046 --> 14:43.581
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, you're a good person.

14:45.015 --> 14:47.182
I just feel like I need
to watch someone slowly die

14:47.184 --> 14:50.286
for regular life
experience, you know?

14:50.288 --> 14:53.022
You know what? We actually...

14:53.024 --> 14:55.090
We really need you to stay
behind, you know what I mean?

14:55.092 --> 14:57.225
'Cause we need reinforcements.

14:57.227 --> 14:59.561
We need somebody to hold
down the fort like you,

14:59.563 --> 15:02.131
nobody ever sends the
whole crew in, right?

15:02.133 --> 15:03.398
I mean, I guess that's
a good point, but...

15:03.400 --> 15:06.401
I need somebody to
figure out how to get

15:06.403 --> 15:08.704
the poison into the
champagne, you know?

15:08.706 --> 15:11.107
- That could be your thing.
- Really?

15:11.109 --> 15:12.541
That's my, I'm
gonna have a thing?

15:12.543 --> 15:14.209
- Yeah, you got a thing!
- Just my thing?

15:14.211 --> 15:17.012
- You've got a thing!
- Alright!

15:17.014 --> 15:18.448
- Yeah!
- Okay.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.485
- So how do we do it?
- Wheels turn, wheels turn.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.087
- Got it.
- Hit me with it.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.991
I call Christine and
ask her what she thinks.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.025
- I love it.
- Alright!

15:29.027 --> 15:30.560
- Good thinkin'!
- Yeah!

15:30.562 --> 15:32.027
There you go, little bro!

15:32.029 --> 15:33.331
Alright, let's call Christine.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.096
I see you!

16:12.370 --> 16:15.073
Okay, okay,
you're breaking me.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.273
Oh, my god, hi!

16:18.275 --> 16:19.144
Hi.

16:20.110 --> 16:22.145
Gosh, you look the same.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.015
That's annoying.

16:24.182 --> 16:26.151
You look like you, too.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.584
- Oh, I'm sorry, this is...
- I'm Sarah.

16:29.586 --> 16:31.686
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

16:31.688 --> 16:32.623
And this is Mel.

16:33.557 --> 16:34.525
The one and only.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.629
Wow, that's quite
the handshake.

16:39.397 --> 16:42.230
So what was that on the
phone yesterday about 11AM?

16:42.232 --> 16:43.666
- You're early.
- It's 10:45.

16:43.668 --> 16:45.568
It's basically 11.

16:45.570 --> 16:48.637
Okay, well, I have a little
bit more packing to do.

16:48.639 --> 16:50.341
So do you mind waiting a minute?

16:52.110 --> 16:53.611
It's great to see you, Kate.

16:55.346 --> 16:56.746
Wow.

16:56.748 --> 16:57.716
Not bad, huh?

16:59.183 --> 17:01.184
- It's beautiful.
- I know, right?

17:01.186 --> 17:03.022
I'm a lucky girl.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.353
Okay, one sec.

17:05.355 --> 17:06.223
Okay.

17:30.414 --> 17:31.847
Oh, what's wrong
with your suitcase?

17:31.849 --> 17:33.181
That sound is horrible.

17:33.183 --> 17:34.150
Oh, yeah.

17:34.152 --> 17:35.684
The wheel is broken.

17:35.686 --> 17:38.121
You can get a new one on
Amazon for like 20 bucks.

17:38.123 --> 17:39.792
I know, this
one's sentimental.

17:41.759 --> 17:44.126
Tell me that's the
one from Niagara Falls.

17:44.128 --> 17:46.194
Ah, the one and only.

17:46.196 --> 17:48.831
That thing take a tumble
down the fucking waterfall?

17:48.833 --> 17:50.266
There'd probably
be way more damage

17:50.268 --> 17:52.401
than just the one wheel
clacking like that.

17:52.403 --> 17:54.836
I'm just saying that if
the suitcase did drop down

17:54.838 --> 17:56.605
the Niagara Falls, there'd
probably be more damage

17:56.607 --> 17:59.241
than just the one
wheel clacking along.

17:59.243 --> 18:01.611
That's a very mature
inference, Sara.

18:01.613 --> 18:03.478
It was the horse
drawn carriage.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.149
They took off and all the
luggage fell out the back.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.753
Oh, Dad was pissed.

18:09.186 --> 18:10.488
It was a really great trip.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.261
- I got it.
- Thank you.

18:18.829 --> 18:20.729
If the car smells
like cigarettes,

18:20.731 --> 18:22.465
I'm going to kill
the both of you.

18:22.467 --> 18:24.834
Okay, then I
need a smoke break

18:24.836 --> 18:27.472
every 100 miles or two hours,
which ever comes first.

18:32.176 --> 18:33.676
Shotgun!

18:33.678 --> 18:35.277
Oh, no, I want Kate to
sit in the front with me.

18:35.279 --> 18:37.615
And we're not stopping
until we get there.

18:58.236 --> 18:59.403
This song sucks.

19:00.672 --> 19:02.274
I kind of like the song, Kate.

19:04.342 --> 19:06.342
Kate, how's life?

19:06.344 --> 19:07.910
How's life?

19:07.912 --> 19:09.344
Um...

19:09.346 --> 19:10.779
I'm good.

19:10.781 --> 19:13.216
And you're still working
for the non-profit?

19:13.218 --> 19:14.887
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Facebook.

19:16.386 --> 19:17.953
Yep.

19:17.955 --> 19:21.623
- Renewables, right?
- Yeah, renewable energy.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.258
That's exciting.

19:23.260 --> 19:25.361
My husband and I just
had a bunch of solar panels

19:25.363 --> 19:26.265
installed on our roof.

19:27.397 --> 19:28.597
I love saying it.

19:28.599 --> 19:30.365
My husband.

19:30.367 --> 19:32.602
Well, solar panels
aren't exactly the same thing,

19:32.604 --> 19:33.835
but it's a good move.

19:33.837 --> 19:35.504
They're kinda the same
thing, though, right?

19:35.506 --> 19:36.542
Solar or whatever.

19:37.575 --> 19:38.442
Sure.

19:39.876 --> 19:43.214
So, any renewable men in
the renewable non-profit?

19:44.348 --> 19:45.347
One or two.

19:45.349 --> 19:46.849
One or two? Who?

19:46.851 --> 19:49.352
Actually, nobody.

19:49.354 --> 19:53.521
Oh, okay, well...

19:53.523 --> 19:57.328
Well, there is this one
guy, he's really nice.

19:58.730 --> 20:03.235
I was gonna surprise him for
Halloween today, but here I am.

20:04.402 --> 20:06.434
Well, I only get married once.

20:06.436 --> 20:10.006
That's optimistic.

20:10.008 --> 20:10.875
Hey, guys?

20:19.817 --> 20:21.851
Do you think he's following us?

20:21.853 --> 20:23.686
It's not a
fucking movie, Sara.

20:23.688 --> 20:25.587
The guy probably
just broke down.

20:25.589 --> 20:27.259
His car's like 100 years old.

20:28.459 --> 20:30.394
Yeah, you're right,
it's probably nothing.

20:31.528 --> 20:33.728
So, how do you
guys know my sister?

20:33.730 --> 20:35.463
- Work.
- Both of you?

20:35.465 --> 20:36.699
Yeah.

20:36.701 --> 20:39.434
Angie teaches English
and everyone loves her.

20:39.436 --> 20:41.871
I teach math, which is
super boring but okay,

20:41.873 --> 20:44.573
and Mel is our shop
teacher, obviously.

20:44.575 --> 20:46.741
Private school kids hate
to get their hands dirty,

20:46.743 --> 20:48.811
so I basically sit
on my ass all day.

20:48.813 --> 20:50.813
I thought teaching
was about stimulating

20:50.815 --> 20:52.480
the kids' attention?

20:52.482 --> 20:53.615
I really don't care.

20:53.617 --> 20:55.317
It's shop.

20:55.319 --> 20:56.951
I put some good music on,
drink a little NyQuil,

20:56.953 --> 20:59.388
and zone out while a
bunch of adolescents

20:59.390 --> 21:00.756
attempt to make a cutting board.

21:00.758 --> 21:02.691
I actually kinda liked shop.

21:02.693 --> 21:04.794
But I guess my teacher
made it interesting.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.429
Well, my students
actually hate me

21:06.431 --> 21:08.764
for expecting 15 minutes
of homework a night.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.766
We got a memo at the
beginning of the school year

21:10.768 --> 21:12.601
about stripping the
children of their ability

21:12.603 --> 21:14.703
to explore
extracurricular activities

21:14.705 --> 21:16.439
with unreasonable
homework demands.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.106
Did you memorize the memo?

21:18.108 --> 21:19.542
I've read it literally
a million times.

21:19.544 --> 21:20.646
I couldn't believe it.

21:21.546 --> 21:23.546
Kids tend to like my class.

21:23.548 --> 21:25.413
That's because you're awesome.

21:25.415 --> 21:28.019
- Awesome Ange.
- Wait, what?

21:29.119 --> 21:30.452
Ask her.

21:30.454 --> 21:31.720
Awesome Ange?

21:31.722 --> 21:33.421
We give each
student a nickname

21:33.423 --> 21:34.590
so we can remember them faster,

21:34.592 --> 21:38.361
and I thought it was only
fair if we all get one, too.

21:38.363 --> 21:41.831
We use alliteration,
like Awesome Ange.

21:41.833 --> 21:42.834
Or Sunny Sara.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.369
And you would be?

21:46.371 --> 21:47.737
Mommy Mel.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.471
Wow.

21:49.473 --> 21:50.439
Oh my god!

21:50.441 --> 21:52.408
- Let's do you.
- Oh, gosh, no.

21:52.410 --> 21:53.077
That's okay.

21:54.444 --> 21:55.878
Cool Kate.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.480
And you're definitely
cool, so I think it works.

21:58.482 --> 21:59.850
But it's Kate with a K.

22:07.125 --> 22:10.159
Okay, why is driving so slow?

22:10.161 --> 22:11.063
'Cause we're hot.

22:13.397 --> 22:14.630
Hi!

22:14.632 --> 22:16.768
This is weird, we should go.

22:33.451 --> 22:35.517
Y'all broke down or somethin'?

22:35.519 --> 22:37.686
No, just enjoying the view.

22:37.688 --> 22:38.853
Please, can we leave?

22:38.855 --> 22:40.525
You sure you
don't need no help?

22:41.692 --> 22:43.595
I got a mechanic
just up the road.

22:44.461 --> 22:47.430
And a real nice motel, too.

22:47.432 --> 22:48.400
Car's not broken.

22:50.634 --> 22:51.502
See?

22:53.770 --> 22:56.140
Four girls all by themselves.

22:57.775 --> 22:58.977
Y'all be careful.

23:00.478 --> 23:01.145
Thanks.

24:08.778 --> 24:10.714
This is amazing.

24:12.517 --> 24:15.017
How much did this
place cost, Mel?

24:15.019 --> 24:18.520
75 a night, two
bedrooms, three bathrooms.

24:18.522 --> 24:20.221
And a real fucking bar.

24:20.223 --> 24:22.591
Thank god we didn't
book that motel.

24:22.593 --> 24:24.192
Oh, man, that
place was a shit-hole.

24:24.194 --> 24:25.594
Even in the pictures.

24:25.596 --> 24:27.228
Where did you guys
find this place?

24:27.230 --> 24:29.064
The LA BnB App.

24:29.066 --> 24:30.533
I've got the
weekend all planned.

24:30.535 --> 24:33.768
We'll go hiking, we'll
have a patio picnic.

24:33.770 --> 24:35.638
I brought six board games.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.105
That actually
sounds really nice.

24:37.107 --> 24:39.842
No, we are not spending the
weekend playing board games.

24:39.844 --> 24:42.978
I brought alcohol, they
have a huge supply.

24:42.980 --> 24:44.680
Come on, this story
writes itself.

24:44.682 --> 24:48.150
Okay, just take it
easy tonight, Mel.

24:48.152 --> 24:49.552
You too, Sara.

24:49.554 --> 24:50.786
Why?

24:50.788 --> 24:52.654
Because I don't wanna
spend my day tomorrow

24:52.656 --> 24:54.923
cleaning up after
the two of you.

24:54.925 --> 24:57.261
Fine,
we'll take it easy.

24:58.663 --> 25:01.532
We'll try and take
it easy.

25:03.601 --> 25:05.770
I almost forgot the
last part of my plan.

25:07.637 --> 25:09.037
No phones.

25:09.039 --> 25:11.774
That's a nice idea,
Sara, but I can't.

25:11.776 --> 25:13.741
I mean, what if
he tries to call?

25:13.743 --> 25:16.247
You're about to spend the
rest of your life with him.

25:18.682 --> 25:19.683
I could use the break.

25:21.751 --> 25:23.288
Okay.

25:33.631 --> 25:35.029
You're joking, right?

25:35.031 --> 25:36.798
Does it look like I'm joking?

25:36.800 --> 25:38.167
Is that a trick question?

25:38.169 --> 25:39.367
Come on!

25:39.369 --> 25:41.703
We're supposed to spend
this time together.

25:41.705 --> 25:43.639
Yeah, but how am
I supposed to make

25:43.641 --> 25:45.341
poor choices without my phone?

25:45.343 --> 25:47.709
It's the only fun
part of a hangover.

25:47.711 --> 25:50.179
You know, picking up the pieces,
figuring out what happened.

25:50.181 --> 25:52.550
I mean, otherwise you're
just hungover, right?

25:53.750 --> 25:55.086
You guys know what
I'm talkin' about.

25:58.221 --> 26:01.090
Okay, fine, I'm gonna finish
ordering this pizza first.

26:01.092 --> 26:03.025
I'm fucking starving.

26:03.027 --> 26:04.793
Totally didn't
think that would work.

26:04.795 --> 26:05.626
You know, this is how people

26:05.628 --> 26:07.565
should do their
bachelorette party.

26:08.265 --> 26:09.931
Calm, easy.

26:09.933 --> 26:11.633
Well, don't tell
that to the entire cast

26:11.635 --> 26:13.768
and crew of Chippendales,
they're showing up later.

26:13.770 --> 26:15.770
Oh, they're great.

26:15.772 --> 26:16.640
I saw 'em in Vegas.

26:18.675 --> 26:21.679
They're not actually
showing up, are they?

26:44.902 --> 26:46.334
Is everything okay out there?

26:46.336 --> 26:47.803
Yeah!

26:47.805 --> 26:50.238
The listing says the
master bedroom is down

26:50.240 --> 26:53.677
the hallway with the crosses,
which isn't at all foreboding.

26:54.979 --> 26:56.844
Well, Kate and I
will share the master,

26:56.846 --> 26:58.817
and you two can share
the other, yeah?

27:01.352 --> 27:02.220
Perfect.

27:41.157 --> 27:42.026
Okay.

27:45.730 --> 27:46.862
We're only here for a night.

27:46.864 --> 27:47.731
That's right!

27:48.999 --> 27:52.834
So, if you unpack, you have
repack everything in 16 hours.

27:52.836 --> 27:54.303
I hate living
out of a suitcase.

27:54.305 --> 27:56.138
It's not really living
out of a suitcase,

27:56.140 --> 27:57.506
if it's only for a night.

27:57.508 --> 27:59.040
The whole point of a LA BnB

27:59.042 --> 28:01.343
is to be a home away from home.

28:01.345 --> 28:03.946
No, it's a cheaper
place to stay,

28:03.948 --> 28:05.350
and sometimes you get lucky.

28:08.818 --> 28:10.518
We could
have been happy!

28:10.520 --> 28:12.054
We could have shared this life.

28:12.056 --> 28:14.021
Sometimes I
don't know which way is up.

28:14.023 --> 28:17.526
I've searched and searched,
I'm scared of what I'll find!

28:17.528 --> 28:19.327
Why can't you understand that?

28:19.329 --> 28:22.163
I understand
everything, Helen.

28:22.165 --> 28:23.431
It'll only be a night.

28:23.433 --> 28:25.199
I already
told you, mister.

28:25.201 --> 28:28.303
We ain't got no rooms
available for your people.

28:28.305 --> 28:31.974
Wait, what?

28:31.976 --> 28:33.311
- Keep the change.
- Dumb.

28:34.478 --> 28:35.346
Hello?

28:36.913 --> 28:38.846
Jimmy, is that you?

28:48.459 --> 28:49.658
Dumb.

28:49.660 --> 28:52.294
It was only three
weeks ago when Rinecher driver

28:52.296 --> 28:56.030
Robert Waltman molested
16-year-old Nancy Connors.

28:56.032 --> 28:57.999
Waltman took the stand
today in what has been...

28:58.001 --> 29:00.902
- Oh, these fucking assholes...
- Shh!

29:00.904 --> 29:02.371
You know what they
should do for real?

29:02.373 --> 29:04.539
They should drag these
sickos out into the desert

29:04.541 --> 29:06.240
and make the world
a better place.

29:06.242 --> 29:07.342
Why do you always
have to be so violent?

29:07.344 --> 29:09.344
I'm not being violent.

29:09.346 --> 29:10.545
I'm asking someone
else to do it.

29:10.547 --> 29:13.515
And now, a tragic
development in San Diego.

29:13.517 --> 29:17.318
Local hero Petey the Dolphin
has died, he was 108.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.953
In dolphin years, of course.

29:18.955 --> 29:21.023
Steve, you are too much.

29:21.025 --> 29:23.892
Stay tuned for information
on memorial services

29:23.894 --> 29:27.563
planned across Southern California
and for the National...

29:27.565 --> 29:30.599
I can't
take it anymore.

29:30.601 --> 29:32.437
It literally parodies itself.

29:34.505 --> 29:36.505
If only there was
some sort of remedy

29:36.507 --> 29:38.076
to help us feel better.

29:39.343 --> 29:43.882
Oh, if only there was!

29:45.449 --> 29:49.418
I say we enjoy this and
then raid the kitchen?

29:49.420 --> 29:51.085
Should we see if
they wanna join us?

29:51.087 --> 29:53.791
No, I'm pretty sure Cool
Kate doesn't smoke pot.

29:55.425 --> 29:57.261
Yeah, they're
probably catchin' up.

29:58.162 --> 30:00.295
Shit, do you have a lighter?

30:14.979 --> 30:17.578
I love how much room we have.

30:17.580 --> 30:18.882
Yeah, it's really great.

30:22.952 --> 30:24.454
So, how's Dillon?

30:25.890 --> 30:26.557
It's Darren.

30:28.625 --> 30:29.894
He's fine, he's good.

30:31.161 --> 30:32.430
I'm really happy.

30:33.596 --> 30:34.464
I'm glad.

30:37.999 --> 30:40.334
He's a little, I don't know.

30:40.336 --> 30:41.937
We've been together
for two years now,

30:41.939 --> 30:45.109
and I'm just now realizing
that he's a little clingy.

30:46.309 --> 30:47.409
They're not gonna be
your favorite person

30:47.411 --> 30:48.911
every day of the week, you know?

30:48.913 --> 30:49.913
Yeah.

30:51.414 --> 30:56.386
But, like, he graduated last
month with his doctorate,

30:58.087 --> 31:01.023
and he flipped out at me for
leaving the ceremony early.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.894
You left his graduation?

31:04.094 --> 31:06.094
Angie, that isn't
not a big deal.

31:06.096 --> 31:07.996
It is not a big deal.

31:07.998 --> 31:09.998
I didn't even wanna
go in the first place.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.635
It was Florida in
September, ungodly humid,

31:14.637 --> 31:17.072
and the host had this
horrible scratchy voice.

31:17.074 --> 31:18.239
Like Aunt Paula, you know?

31:18.241 --> 31:20.342
This host was like a year away

31:20.344 --> 31:22.046
from that hole in your throat.

31:23.513 --> 31:25.948
And Darren's mom,
she's a wonderful lady,

31:25.950 --> 31:29.084
but she sobs uncontrollably.

31:29.086 --> 31:31.452
You know when you're on a
plane and a baby is crying

31:31.454 --> 31:34.055
and everybody is
looking at the parent?

31:34.057 --> 31:36.123
That's how everybody
was looking at me,

31:36.125 --> 31:38.028
because I was with her.

31:39.696 --> 31:41.131
His dad's not in the picture.

31:42.967 --> 31:45.366
He just kept going on
and on about me leaving.

31:45.368 --> 31:48.135
He was like, "I put
myself through school,

31:48.137 --> 31:49.537
"you don't respect me,

31:49.539 --> 31:52.076
"how can you love someone
and abandon them?"

31:53.576 --> 31:56.044
He's dramatic,
that's what it is.

31:56.046 --> 31:58.412
And I was like, "babe,
it was the sweat,

31:58.414 --> 32:00.748
"compounded with
your mom's sobbing,

32:00.750 --> 32:03.218
"compounded with the
second-coming of Aunt Paula."

32:03.220 --> 32:05.189
But he just didn't get it.

32:06.155 --> 32:08.023
I don't know.

32:08.025 --> 32:09.490
I have no idea how to accelerate

32:09.492 --> 32:12.361
his never-ending
adolescence, you know?

32:12.363 --> 32:13.230
Wow.

32:14.664 --> 32:16.297
What?

32:16.299 --> 32:17.567
Was it really that bad?

32:20.738 --> 32:22.006
Are you kidding?

32:23.673 --> 32:25.207
You weren't even there,
how would you know?

32:25.209 --> 32:28.009
I mean, even your
really dramatic version

32:28.011 --> 32:31.046
of the whole thing
sounds bearable.

32:31.048 --> 32:32.546
Graduations are
important, Angie.

32:32.548 --> 32:35.182
You can't really
make that up to him.

32:35.184 --> 32:36.453
I hope you apologized.

32:37.453 --> 32:38.556
For what?

32:39.423 --> 32:41.155
Did you listen to my story?

32:41.157 --> 32:44.593
Yeah, I did, I just think
that whatever you're complaining

32:44.595 --> 32:47.030
about isn't actually
the problem here.

32:49.333 --> 32:52.066
You know, I really wanted
you here for this weekend,

32:52.068 --> 32:55.170
but not if you're
gonna be like...

32:55.172 --> 32:56.039
Go on, say it.

32:58.442 --> 32:59.309
You.

33:01.178 --> 33:03.210
Well, at least I'm here.

33:03.212 --> 33:05.383
Remind me where you've
been the last five years.

33:06.750 --> 33:07.617
Come on, Kate.

33:09.153 --> 33:10.352
Darren...

33:10.354 --> 33:12.054
Oh, no, you just said
it's been two years.

33:12.056 --> 33:14.125
What's your excuse
for the other three?

33:29.205 --> 33:30.073
Okay.

33:31.307 --> 33:33.141
What happened?

33:33.143 --> 33:35.278
Things were fine
like two seconds ago.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.250
Can we just have
fun this weekend?

33:42.152 --> 33:43.020
I'm trying.

33:44.421 --> 33:45.390
Try harder.

33:49.192 --> 33:50.459
Guess what I found.

33:50.461 --> 33:52.193
Are you sure we're
allowed to have that?

33:52.195 --> 33:55.229
Better to drink their stash
before breaking into mine.

33:55.231 --> 33:57.067
And they have a
stash, believe you me.

33:58.301 --> 33:59.736
Champagne sounds perfect.

34:10.447 --> 34:11.315
Give it to me.

34:16.286 --> 34:21.255
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

34:21.257 --> 34:22.125
Baby!

34:27.264 --> 34:28.661
Oh, no, thank you.

34:28.664 --> 34:32.132
Right, more for us.

34:32.135 --> 34:33.367
Cheers.

34:33.369 --> 34:35.570
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.237
Hey, can I ask
all of you something

34:37.239 --> 34:39.110
- that's been bothering me?
- Oh, boy.

34:40.277 --> 34:42.177
Do you think anybody
moves to Waco, Texas

34:42.179 --> 34:44.512
just to meet Chip
and Joanna Gaines?

34:44.514 --> 34:46.179
The home
flipper people?

34:46.181 --> 34:48.282
No, they're the Fixer Uppers.

34:48.284 --> 34:50.251
The flippers are the
other ones in the suits.

34:50.253 --> 34:52.253
Well, the guy's in the suit.

34:52.255 --> 34:53.353
I don't think anybody moves

34:53.356 --> 34:55.257
to Waco, Texas just
to meet someone.

34:55.259 --> 34:58.159
You move to Waco, Texas
only if you absolutely must.

34:58.161 --> 35:01.195
Or if you're from
there, obviously.

35:01.197 --> 35:02.930
Even then, I mean, those
kids have gotta be desperate

35:02.932 --> 35:04.231
to get outta there.

35:04.233 --> 35:05.534
Seriously.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.735
Even I couldn't wait to
get out after high school.

35:07.737 --> 35:09.271
That's for sure.

35:09.273 --> 35:11.639
- What's that, Kate?
- Oh, nothing.

35:11.641 --> 35:13.810
No, you were
gonna say something.

35:14.878 --> 35:15.746
No.

35:16.612 --> 35:18.148
I've got it!

35:19.182 --> 35:21.383
Kinky Kate!

35:21.385 --> 35:23.418
In that sweater?

35:23.420 --> 35:24.521
I highly doubt it.

35:25.355 --> 35:26.887
I like this sweater.

35:26.889 --> 35:29.292
I just don't think kinky
is the right word for you.

35:32.262 --> 35:33.628
This tastes strange.

35:33.630 --> 35:36.200
Oh, it could have been
in there a while, but,

35:36.900 --> 35:38.503
I'm a woman of simple pleasures.

35:39.570 --> 35:40.638
So am I.

35:42.706 --> 35:44.338
My stomach does
kinda hurt a little.

35:44.340 --> 35:45.507
Power through.

35:45.509 --> 35:47.742
I will, I just,
maybe I should eat something.

35:47.744 --> 35:48.646
I'm really hungry.

35:50.313 --> 35:51.213
I'm right there with you.

35:51.215 --> 35:52.880
I hope that pizza
guy gets here soon.

35:52.882 --> 35:54.883
They might have TUMS or
something in the bathroom.

35:54.885 --> 35:58.452
Oh, no, it's alright, I'd
rather let it pass naturally.

35:58.454 --> 36:00.157
Are you one of those people?

36:01.324 --> 36:02.923
How did I not know
this about you?

36:02.925 --> 36:04.159
You end up dependent.

36:04.161 --> 36:07.729
No, I mean, so then keep TUMS
in every room in your house,

36:07.731 --> 36:10.231
and in the car,
and in the office.

36:10.233 --> 36:11.601
I can't grasp why...

36:12.869 --> 36:16.403
So, scientists invent a magic
pill that takes the pain away.

36:16.405 --> 36:18.373
Are you saying you're
better than science, Sara?

36:18.375 --> 36:19.641
I'd just rather not...

36:19.643 --> 36:21.309
Every time that I
have a stomach ache,

36:21.311 --> 36:23.510
I take something and
then I feel better.

36:23.512 --> 36:27.382
So, I mean,
what are we saying here?

36:27.384 --> 36:29.416
I mean, honestly,
I just can't grasp,

36:29.418 --> 36:31.753
if the cure exists, it seems...

36:31.755 --> 36:34.488
Okay, I think you're getting
a little bit worked up here.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.393
I'm sorry, it's
just baffling to me.

36:37.527 --> 36:38.596
But hey, it's your...

36:41.297 --> 36:42.764
Shit.

36:42.766 --> 36:44.635
I just got why they
call them TUMS.

36:45.936 --> 36:47.969
TUMS, tummy.

36:47.971 --> 36:49.472
Yeah, I got it!

36:51.608 --> 36:54.512
Okay, I'm gonna go take
a look around the house.

36:56.313 --> 36:57.682
I never drink this stuff.

36:58.581 --> 37:00.414
It's too bubbly.

37:00.416 --> 37:01.552
That's ironic.

39:22.057 --> 39:23.724
God damnit.

39:27.797 --> 39:28.798
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:32.702 --> 39:36.137
Hey, wait, where's
your ski mask?

39:36.139 --> 39:38.173
We're killing them.

39:38.175 --> 39:40.811
Plus, it's your dad's
house, no cameras?

39:43.746 --> 39:46.015
Yeah, I guess
you have a point.

39:53.123 --> 39:55.126
Where the fuck is Terry?

40:18.514 --> 40:20.550
- Oh, shit.
- Dammit, Terry.

40:21.650 --> 40:23.217
I guess it's time.

40:23.219 --> 40:25.787
Terry's time, we're
always on Terry's time.

40:25.789 --> 40:27.755
Give him a fuckin' break,
you're not down there.

40:27.757 --> 40:30.525
Who even knows if they drank
enough of that champagne huh?

40:30.527 --> 40:32.596
We've gotta go,
we've gotta go now.

40:33.563 --> 40:34.432
You're right.

40:38.068 --> 40:41.068
Hey, you guys, I just
saw something strange.

40:41.070 --> 40:42.936
Were you looking
in the mirror?

40:42.938 --> 40:44.141
Come on, Mel.

40:46.208 --> 40:48.108
I think someone's here.

40:48.110 --> 40:50.945
I just found a muddy
footprint on the front porch.

40:50.947 --> 40:52.613
What?

40:52.615 --> 40:53.947
It's probably just
trick-or-treaters.

40:53.949 --> 40:55.916
I don't know, I
don't think that kids

40:55.918 --> 40:58.052
would climb up that
hill for candy.

40:58.054 --> 40:59.686
I would have
sucked Barny's dick

40:59.688 --> 41:01.255
for a Snickers
bar when I was 10.

41:01.257 --> 41:03.291
Okay.

41:03.293 --> 41:04.995
Okay, okay, wait, though.

41:06.563 --> 41:09.796
So you're saying there's
footprints outside to the door?

41:09.798 --> 41:12.599
- Yes.
- Okay, okay.

41:12.601 --> 41:14.601
- Sara...
- Now I'm really freaked out.

41:14.603 --> 41:16.704
It's Halloween, she's
just trying to scare you.

41:16.706 --> 41:18.539
Come on, I don't
even like Halloween.

41:18.541 --> 41:19.610
Angie, tell them.

41:20.744 --> 41:22.847
Nobody's up here, Kate.

41:28.751 --> 41:30.552
Wait.

41:30.554 --> 41:31.222
Show us.

41:39.862 --> 41:42.198
It's just fucking
trick-or-treaters, come on.

41:44.166 --> 41:46.800
- You weren't kidding.
- I told you.

41:46.802 --> 41:49.637
Who do you think it is?

42:02.585 --> 42:04.084
- Guys.
- What?

42:05.688 --> 42:08.722
- Are you okay?
- My stomach really hurts.

42:08.724 --> 42:11.025
What should we do,
what if Kate's right?

42:11.027 --> 42:14.228
Okay, everybody just relax,
she's trying to scare you.

42:14.230 --> 42:15.597
What if she isn't?

42:15.599 --> 42:17.065
They're just
trick-or-treaters.

42:17.067 --> 42:18.900
Come on, if they were
just trick-or-treaters,

42:18.902 --> 42:20.367
why didn't they knock?

42:20.369 --> 42:21.769
Maybe we couldn't hear
them over your shrill voice.

42:21.771 --> 42:23.637
You're drunk, Mel.

42:23.639 --> 42:25.139
We all saw the footprint.

42:25.141 --> 42:27.775
What if it's the owners,
maybe they're trying to get in?

42:27.777 --> 42:29.644
No, the owners
would have the keys.

42:29.646 --> 42:30.744
This bitch has
been complaining...

42:30.746 --> 42:31.845
Don't call me that.

42:31.847 --> 42:33.347
- Mel...
- What is your problem?

42:33.349 --> 42:34.916
It's true, she's just
trying to upset you, Ange.

42:34.918 --> 42:37.651
- She's probably jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

42:37.653 --> 42:39.220
Same thing happened
with Sara's sister.

42:39.222 --> 42:40.921
She trying to ruin your
bachelorette party.

42:40.923 --> 42:42.356
Honestly, Kate, I'm offended.

42:42.358 --> 42:44.627
Melanie, stop it.

42:45.996 --> 42:49.063
Listen, Mel, I'm not trying
to start anything here.

42:49.065 --> 42:51.365
I'm the new girl, I
get it, that's fine.

42:51.367 --> 42:53.867
But we all saw the
same thing out there.

42:53.869 --> 42:54.938
Someone is here.

42:56.338 --> 42:57.905
We should leave.

42:57.907 --> 42:59.807
- We should just leave.
- Really, really?

42:59.809 --> 43:01.679
Do I have to prove
that we're alone?

43:03.746 --> 43:05.713
Mel, don't.

43:05.715 --> 43:06.584
Don't what?

43:11.086 --> 43:12.253
Like I said...

43:15.925 --> 43:17.724
Melanie!

43:19.161 --> 43:22.632
Holy shit!

43:23.932 --> 43:25.233
Oh my god, oh my god,
Kate, we have to leave.

43:25.235 --> 43:26.604
We have to leave.

43:27.737 --> 43:29.373
We're gonna die here!

43:33.443 --> 43:34.778
What do you want?

43:42.786 --> 43:44.121
Kate, come on.

43:47.257 --> 43:48.692
You're not getting in here.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.662
We already are.

43:59.835 --> 44:00.770
I missed.

44:03.005 --> 44:04.708
What are we supposed to do?

44:08.411 --> 44:09.278
Go get her.

44:10.780 --> 44:11.715
Where's your mask?

44:13.115 --> 44:15.416
We're killing them.

44:15.418 --> 44:17.086
Fuck yeah we are.

44:21.891 --> 44:23.891
I like the way it looks.

44:23.893 --> 44:24.762
Go!

44:26.329 --> 44:27.398
Let us in first!

44:33.036 --> 44:34.869
Do you think they
can get in here?

44:34.871 --> 44:36.336
Oh my god.

44:36.338 --> 44:39.139
This is it, this is it,
we're gonna die in a LA BnB.

44:39.141 --> 44:41.742
No, no, no, we're
not gonna die.

44:41.744 --> 44:43.447
It's gonna be fine,
just let me think.

44:47.784 --> 44:50.016
- Shit.
- What happened?

44:50.018 --> 44:51.753
Terry missed.

44:51.755 --> 44:54.088
Unbelievable, he's gonna
blow this whole thing up.

44:54.090 --> 44:56.824
- You realize that, right?
- No he's not. We're here.

44:56.826 --> 44:58.362
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Jesus.

44:59.329 --> 45:01.762
- Dad just bought those.
- So?

45:01.764 --> 45:03.930
So they're expensive.

45:03.932 --> 45:06.534
Like really expensive,
floor to ceiling?

45:06.536 --> 45:08.369
That's why we just break one.

45:08.371 --> 45:09.836
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Jimmy!

45:09.838 --> 45:11.271
- No, look...
- Cut your fuckin' hand off.

45:11.273 --> 45:14.876
If you break that window
or you crack a door,

45:14.878 --> 45:16.209
or anything, he's gonna kill me.

45:16.211 --> 45:18.045
I'm gonna be the one that dies.

45:18.047 --> 45:22.016
It's a murder spree, things
are bound to get messy.

45:22.018 --> 45:25.318
Look, as long as we
can mop it up, I'm calm.

45:25.320 --> 45:27.090
That's the kinda
messy Jimmy likes.

45:28.291 --> 45:30.925
But the real issue here,
your brother is inside,

45:30.927 --> 45:34.228
he's got the house keys
and the IQ of a toaster.

45:34.230 --> 45:35.929
If we don't find another
way in there fast,

45:35.931 --> 45:37.867
he's gonna start
breaking everything.

45:39.001 --> 45:39.867
Yeah.

45:41.003 --> 45:42.505
That's not good.

45:44.007 --> 45:45.305
Hide.

45:55.251 --> 45:56.120
He left.

45:58.521 --> 46:00.153
Oh, thank god.

46:02.157 --> 46:04.291
That was the front door.

46:04.293 --> 46:05.927
We're saved!

46:05.929 --> 46:07.128
What?

46:07.130 --> 46:08.362
Maybe it's the
police or something.

46:08.364 --> 46:09.563
Sara, why would
you think that?

46:09.565 --> 46:11.898
Because if it was one of
them, they'd just come inside.

46:11.900 --> 46:14.203
Sara, they could just
be trying to trick us.

46:19.576 --> 46:21.208
Hello?

46:21.210 --> 46:23.244
They're here to save us!

46:23.246 --> 46:25.512
It's the cops!

46:25.514 --> 46:26.914
Sara, don't.

46:28.918 --> 46:30.184
I told you.

46:30.186 --> 46:31.952
They're gone.

46:31.954 --> 46:33.287
I don't think
this a good idea.

46:33.289 --> 46:35.092
I know it's not a good idea.

46:38.094 --> 46:38.961
Sara, wait.

46:45.934 --> 46:47.068
You're not the cops.

46:47.070 --> 46:48.436
No shit.

46:48.438 --> 46:50.304
What took you so long?

46:50.306 --> 46:52.039
I called you guys
like 1,000 times.

46:52.041 --> 46:53.941
I got lost coming up here.

46:53.943 --> 46:56.313
Did you guys order a
large sausage pizza?

46:59.114 --> 47:02.016
Mel did.

47:02.018 --> 47:03.251
Okay?

47:03.253 --> 47:08.125
Well, Mel owes me
22.50, plus tip.

47:10.960 --> 47:12.963
Mel's dead.

47:13.663 --> 47:15.595
Sure she is.

47:15.597 --> 47:17.900
Mel's dead, I'm the cops.

47:19.034 --> 47:20.367
Look, can you guys just pay me,

47:20.369 --> 47:22.036
so I can get the
hell outta here?

47:22.038 --> 47:24.505
I mean, my boss has me runnin'
all over the town tonight.

47:24.507 --> 47:27.041
You know, you guys live
in the fuckin' mountains,

47:27.043 --> 47:28.476
- and I'm just...
- Get inside.

47:28.478 --> 47:30.443
Seriously, just give me
22 bucks, I'll get out...

47:30.445 --> 47:31.315
Come on!

47:32.215 --> 47:37.221
Oh, shit!

47:45.961 --> 47:48.329
- What the fuck is happenin'?
- I'm so glad you're safe.

47:48.331 --> 47:50.300
I'm sorry, I thought
he was the cops.

47:52.201 --> 47:54.001
I really don't feel good.

47:54.003 --> 47:54.702
Excuse me?

47:54.704 --> 47:56.103
Hi, hello.

47:56.105 --> 47:57.972
What the hell is going on?

47:57.974 --> 47:59.941
Those people
are trying to kill us.

47:59.943 --> 48:02.543
Why don't y'all just run
through the front door?

48:02.545 --> 48:04.313
They've got the
place surrounded.

48:05.447 --> 48:07.682
No, but he's
got a point, like,

48:07.684 --> 48:09.016
why don't we make a run for it?

48:09.018 --> 48:10.383
You, you played softball.

48:10.385 --> 48:12.052
I played soccer.

48:12.054 --> 48:13.356
- I played lacrosse.
- Done.

48:14.489 --> 48:16.691
- Done?
- I mean, you played softball.

48:16.693 --> 48:19.193
I played soccer, cute
girl play lacrosse.

48:19.195 --> 48:20.728
You know what that means?

48:20.730 --> 48:22.329
What does it mean, pizza guy?

48:22.331 --> 48:24.965
It means we're fast.

48:24.967 --> 48:26.700
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

48:26.702 --> 48:27.802
What?

48:27.804 --> 48:29.603
There's a spiked baseball
bat out there waiting

48:29.605 --> 48:31.271
for us to do something stupid.

48:31.273 --> 48:33.007
Look, you guys can
hang around all you like.

48:33.009 --> 48:34.708
I've got two more
deliveries to make,

48:34.710 --> 48:37.244
and if they're not there
in 30 minutes, it's free.

48:40.048 --> 48:41.182
Damn!

48:41.184 --> 48:43.516
- Sara?
- It's not the pizza.

48:43.518 --> 48:46.086
How much of that champagne
did you have to drink?

48:46.088 --> 48:47.320
Oh my god, the champagne.

48:47.322 --> 48:49.023
Sara?

48:49.025 --> 48:49.693
Wake up.

48:51.126 --> 48:52.295
She's not breathing.

48:53.295 --> 48:54.297
Feel her pulse.

48:56.199 --> 48:57.067
Angie.

48:59.735 --> 49:00.670
Sara?

49:02.070 --> 49:04.104
Sara, wake up.

49:04.106 --> 49:06.139
Sara, wake up.

49:06.141 --> 49:10.144
Sara!

49:10.146 --> 49:12.045
I'm sorry.

49:12.047 --> 49:12.715
No!

49:13.983 --> 49:16.687
I'm sorry about your friend
too, but we really have to go.

49:19.521 --> 49:20.389
Angie.

49:45.114 --> 49:47.050
I think we're good.

49:49.052 --> 49:50.420
I think we're good.

49:55.824 --> 49:58.559
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Hey, pizza guy!

49:58.561 --> 50:00.728
You forgot the ranch.

50:03.733 --> 50:04.668
Oh, shit!

50:06.702 --> 50:08.735
Wait, pizza guy!

50:08.737 --> 50:09.605
Sara?

50:13.775 --> 50:15.376
Hey.

50:15.378 --> 50:17.211
That's my name.

50:17.213 --> 50:18.512
No shit?

50:18.514 --> 50:22.215
Well, then I guess this
was meant to be.

50:28.224 --> 50:29.092
My tongue.

50:30.193 --> 50:33.764
I bit my fucking tongue.

50:36.164 --> 50:37.697
Bite this.

51:01.123 --> 51:02.091
Pizza guy!

51:05.894 --> 51:07.228
Slashed the tires.

51:07.230 --> 51:09.229
- No!
- No, I did.

51:09.231 --> 51:11.233
Just look, you
can't go anywhere.

51:13.436 --> 51:14.304
It's over.

51:16.838 --> 51:18.838
What's your name?

51:18.840 --> 51:19.708
Sara.

51:21.143 --> 51:23.112
It's over, Sara.

51:24.746 --> 51:25.815
You're gonna die.

51:26.748 --> 51:28.282
Fuck you!

51:28.284 --> 51:29.650
Fuck me? Fuck you.

51:31.454 --> 51:35.425
Shit, you hit me in
the fuckin' eye, Sara!

51:36.358 --> 51:38.527
I can't see out of my eye.

52:19.335 --> 52:22.139
Hey, Sara.

52:23.338 --> 52:24.440
Please, no.

52:25.907 --> 52:27.743
Aw, yes, yes, yes, yes.

52:29.378 --> 52:31.211
It's over, Sara.

52:40.922 --> 52:42.558
How's that feel, Sara?

52:47.762 --> 52:49.295
Fuck!

52:49.297 --> 52:50.166
Fuckin'!

53:02.277 --> 53:03.279
No.

53:12.387 --> 53:13.255
Sara...

53:35.043 --> 53:36.809
Do you think
Sara got out okay?

53:36.811 --> 53:39.947
I don't know, I
didn't hear a car start.

53:39.949 --> 53:41.447
Maybe she ran.

53:41.449 --> 53:42.117
Maybe.

53:43.753 --> 53:45.222
- Is that gonna work?
- I...

53:46.655 --> 53:48.722
I don't know, I think this
is how you do it, right?

53:48.724 --> 53:49.593
I guess.

53:50.626 --> 53:53.059
I can't really feel anything.

53:53.061 --> 53:54.396
I'm so sorry.

54:03.472 --> 54:05.673
How many more are there?

54:05.675 --> 54:08.342
I don't know,
I think just one.

54:08.344 --> 54:10.480
There could be more but
I haven't seen them.

54:11.646 --> 54:12.579
I can't believe
they haven't tried

54:12.581 --> 54:13.750
to break that door down yet.

54:22.490 --> 54:23.423
Kate?

54:23.425 --> 54:25.494
I'm just resting
my eyes for a second.

54:30.333 --> 54:31.867
You killed that guy.

54:33.702 --> 54:34.670
He hurt you.

54:36.105 --> 54:38.407
He would have killed us
both if he had the chance.

54:41.876 --> 54:42.746
Are you hurt?

54:46.916 --> 54:51.488
I was just thinking about
Niagara Falls with Mom and Dad.

54:55.824 --> 54:57.359
I really do miss you.

54:58.027 --> 54:59.295
I wasn't just saying that.

55:03.099 --> 55:04.000
I miss you, too.

55:07.603 --> 55:10.371
I talk to Dad a
few times a year.

55:10.373 --> 55:11.340
Holidays, birthdays.

55:13.708 --> 55:16.512
I don't think I got a call
from you on my last birthday.

55:18.012 --> 55:19.912
I was staring at your
contact in my phone

55:19.914 --> 55:21.317
for about an hour.

55:23.018 --> 55:27.121
I cannot believe we
locked our phones in the car.

55:29.657 --> 55:30.893
How dumb are we?

55:36.865 --> 55:38.565
I should leave.

55:38.567 --> 55:40.767
I should leave, I should
just leave, I can leave.

55:40.769 --> 55:42.135
I'm not a killer, right?

55:42.137 --> 55:44.137
No, I have asthma.

55:44.139 --> 55:46.173
Killers don't have asthma,
you know?

55:46.175 --> 55:49.476
I've had an inhaler in my
pocket the entire killing spree.

55:49.478 --> 55:53.546
I have carpet on my dashboard,
that is very sensible.

55:53.548 --> 55:56.048
Killers don't have carpet
on their dashboards, okay?

55:56.050 --> 55:57.851
I don't even text when I drive.

55:57.853 --> 55:59.121
Who am I even talking to?

56:00.456 --> 56:01.691
Who am I even talking to?

56:03.159 --> 56:06.793
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go,
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go.

56:11.666 --> 56:14.568
I mean, I have to kill them
whether I want to or not,

56:14.570 --> 56:17.137
because they know what
I look like, right?

56:17.139 --> 56:21.974
Either you kill those girls
or you die, or you start

56:21.976 --> 56:24.711
a new life somewhere and you
never see your father again.

56:24.713 --> 56:27.713
I can use the shotgun,
it would be effective.

56:27.715 --> 56:31.651
It would definitely kill them,
but also, pretty grisly, huh?

56:31.653 --> 56:34.588
I could just drive away and go.

56:34.590 --> 56:37.023
I can go, I can go, I can
go, I can go, I can go.

56:37.025 --> 56:40.726
I'm gonna use the knife, go
in once and then I could even

56:40.728 --> 56:43.996
leave the knife there, you know,
just goes in and then dead,

56:43.998 --> 56:46.666
and they get to keep the
knife, they keep the knife.

56:46.668 --> 56:47.536
You.

56:48.938 --> 56:49.869
You.

56:49.871 --> 56:51.604
You look like a killer to me.

56:51.606 --> 56:54.807
I'm just gonna take a few
minutes to rest my eyes,

56:54.809 --> 56:57.514
and then I'm gonna go back
in and kill them, okay?

57:17.632 --> 57:19.101
I haven't said this before.

57:21.070 --> 57:24.007
I'm really sorry that I
missed out on so much.

57:28.844 --> 57:29.711
It's hard.

57:44.893 --> 57:47.594
I brought this for you.

57:47.596 --> 57:48.597
Oh my god!

57:50.099 --> 57:51.731
Where did you find it?

57:51.733 --> 57:53.700
I kept it around
after you left.

57:53.702 --> 57:55.638
I don't really know why.

57:56.838 --> 57:57.840
Thank you.

57:59.641 --> 58:00.509
I love him.

58:01.677 --> 58:05.711
Dad wanted me to bring you
something nice.

58:05.713 --> 58:07.583
He's gonna be
so upset with me.

58:08.583 --> 58:09.618
Why?

58:11.286 --> 58:13.489
I haven't called
since Christmas.

58:14.623 --> 58:16.826
You haven't talked
to Dad since last year?

58:18.893 --> 58:19.761
I've been busy.

58:24.599 --> 58:26.635
How is he doing,
is he doing better?

58:29.070 --> 58:30.507
Dad's worse, Ange.

58:31.606 --> 58:32.675
We just found out.

58:35.043 --> 58:36.545
How come nobody told me?

58:38.079 --> 58:39.715
I thought you knew.

58:41.717 --> 58:42.751
He must hate me.

58:44.586 --> 58:48.157
No, he doesn't hate you.

58:49.724 --> 58:50.891
The only reason
I'm here is because

58:50.893 --> 58:52.528
he practically begged me.

58:54.597 --> 58:57.133
- Oh.
- No, I...

58:58.266 --> 58:59.700
I didn't mean it
like that, I just...

58:59.702 --> 59:00.904
What did you mean it like?

59:03.606 --> 59:04.574
I want to be here.

59:05.907 --> 59:08.176
And Dad just wants to
see us happy, you know?

59:13.681 --> 59:15.617
Nobody hates you, Ange.

59:16.985 --> 59:18.621
It's actually the opposite.

59:19.655 --> 59:22.692
It's pretty disgusting.

59:28.731 --> 59:30.133
I'm tired.

59:31.699 --> 59:32.766
Yeah.

59:32.768 --> 59:33.670
Yeah, we should...

59:35.103 --> 59:37.771
You should get some sleep
and I'll stay up, okay?

59:37.773 --> 59:39.706
We have a better chance of
getting out of here alive

59:39.708 --> 59:41.010
if we wait for daylight.

59:42.210 --> 59:45.012
Will you wake me up
if something happens?

59:45.014 --> 59:46.182
Yeah.

01:00:33.461 --> 01:00:34.927
Kate?

01:00:34.929 --> 01:00:35.797
Hey.

01:00:36.864 --> 01:00:38.800
Hey, how are you feeling?

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:47.907
I had the best dream, but
I can't remember it now.

01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:48.777
That's okay.

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:52.148
If we get outta
here, I wanna go home.

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.719
- I wanna see Dad.
- We'll see Dad.

01:01:00.722 --> 01:01:02.125
There has to be an answer here.

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:05.858
We can't run.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.728
No.

01:01:07.963 --> 01:01:12.335
If Sara didn't get away, the
car must be broken somehow.

01:01:14.869 --> 01:01:16.772
There's still at least some...

01:01:21.275 --> 01:01:22.144
What?

01:01:23.512 --> 01:01:25.181
We're in the
middle of nowhere.

01:01:26.782 --> 01:01:28.684
You said it yourself, no
one's climbing up that hill.

01:01:30.318 --> 01:01:31.454
They drove here.

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:35.358
One of them has to
have a set of keys.

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:41.094
- Which one?
- The one in the house?

01:01:41.096 --> 01:01:42.929
If he has the
keys to the house...

01:01:42.931 --> 01:01:45.068
Then he has keys to the car.

01:01:47.001 --> 01:01:48.869
I have to go look.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:51.771
- Take me with you.
- No, you're safer here.

01:01:51.773 --> 01:01:53.375
If he finds me, I'm dead.

01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:56.778
Alright, come on.

01:02:12.927 --> 01:02:13.795
Wow.

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:16.866
He stayed like that all night.

01:02:17.965 --> 01:02:18.835
That's crazy.

01:02:19.434 --> 01:02:20.870
Isn't that crazy?

01:02:23.938 --> 01:02:25.805
Is he alive?

01:02:25.807 --> 01:02:27.807
I don't think so.

01:02:27.809 --> 01:02:29.010
Look at his head.

01:02:39.353 --> 01:02:40.889
Come on, Kate.

01:02:41.556 --> 01:02:43.091
This guy is full of shit.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.164
Looking for these?

01:02:50.231 --> 01:02:52.865
You know,
I gotta say,

01:02:52.867 --> 01:02:55.135
this really was supposed
to go a lot smoother.

01:02:55.137 --> 01:02:57.871
And I want you to know,
please believe me,

01:02:57.873 --> 01:03:00.777
this was not my
idea, not at all.

01:03:01.443 --> 01:03:02.411
Even so...

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:04.814
I have to...

01:03:06.047 --> 01:03:07.182
Kill you now.

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:10.950
Oh, you don't know what
this is doing to me.

01:03:10.952 --> 01:03:13.855
Emotionally, psychologically,
all of it, okay?

01:03:15.023 --> 01:03:17.260
Don't make this harder
than it has to be, okay?

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.360
Deal?

01:03:20.362 --> 01:03:22.494
You brought this on yourself.

01:03:22.496 --> 01:03:24.530
Be reasonable,
I mean,

01:03:24.532 --> 01:03:27.066
you saw what we did
to your friends?

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:28.971
Do you see what
we did to yours?

01:03:30.172 --> 01:03:31.340
They weren't friends.

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:35.510
They were family.

01:03:37.144 --> 01:03:38.577
They were family.

01:03:43.217 --> 01:03:44.186
Again, I'm...

01:03:45.653 --> 01:03:48.153
I am sorry about this, you know?

01:03:50.458 --> 01:03:51.960
Go, I'll be fine, go!

01:04:18.954 --> 01:04:20.420
Please stop running!

01:04:20.422 --> 01:04:21.891
I thought we made a deal.

01:04:25.626 --> 01:04:28.028
I'm a killer, I'm a killer,
I'm a killer, I'm a killer.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.066
I'm a killer, I'm a killer.

01:04:43.277 --> 01:04:44.443
Kate!

01:04:44.445 --> 01:04:45.313
Angie!

01:05:03.597 --> 01:05:04.467
Oh, god.

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:07.202
It hurts.

01:05:08.503 --> 01:05:10.573
- It hurts so much.
- Why are you doing this?

01:05:11.706 --> 01:05:13.009
- Water.
- No way.

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.245
- Water.
- Don't touch me.

01:05:19.014 --> 01:05:20.583
Can you just pull
it out, please?

01:05:24.318 --> 01:05:25.987
- What's your name?
- Jimmy.

01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:28.157
Oh, god.

01:05:29.157 --> 01:05:30.155
I can't feel my legs.

01:05:30.157 --> 01:05:33.126
I know you'll do the
right thing here, Jimmy.

01:05:33.128 --> 01:05:34.561
Why did you do this?

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:37.697
We didn't have a choice, okay?

01:05:37.699 --> 01:05:40.233
He made us do it.

01:05:40.235 --> 01:05:41.501
Who made you do it?

01:05:41.503 --> 01:05:44.003
We were supposed to
wait for you to drink

01:05:44.005 --> 01:05:47.639
all the champagne, but Terry
went in early and fucked us.

01:05:47.641 --> 01:05:50.045
He fucked us, he fucked us.

01:05:51.346 --> 01:05:53.512
I swear, I spent
most of the night

01:05:53.514 --> 01:05:55.250
trying to convince
myself to leave.

01:05:57.184 --> 01:05:58.054
What do you do?

01:05:59.186 --> 01:06:00.255
I'm a bellhop.

01:06:01.289 --> 01:06:03.155
A bellhop?

01:06:03.157 --> 01:06:06.159
Yeah, at the Motel California.

01:06:06.161 --> 01:06:07.296
It's my family's place.

01:06:08.163 --> 01:06:10.095
My Dad owns this house.

01:06:10.097 --> 01:06:11.798
I know where that motel is.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.800
That's where we were
thinking of staying, but,

01:06:13.802 --> 01:06:15.702
but Mel found that
LA BnB instead.

01:06:15.704 --> 01:06:18.170
Yeah, that really
hurt his feelings.

01:06:18.172 --> 01:06:19.773
Well, your prices
are too high.

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:22.141
I've been telling
him that for years.

01:06:22.143 --> 01:06:24.411
I thought you just
said he owns this house?

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:25.280
He does.

01:06:26.681 --> 01:06:27.717
I can see your point.

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:32.654
Sometimes I don't
know which way is up.

01:06:33.655 --> 01:06:34.523
What?

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:37.426
I'm sorry.

01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:48.104
There's a surprise
for you in the trunk,

01:06:49.403 --> 01:06:51.407
and the motel isn't far.

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.175
Dad just said you'd die.

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.313
I wonder what he'll
say when he meets me.

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:02.751
Look at that.

01:07:08.556 --> 01:07:10.623
Shouldn't we should
call the police?

01:08:03.445 --> 01:08:05.247
Motel California.

01:08:06.681 --> 01:08:08.083
Are we going in there?

01:08:09.851 --> 01:08:11.186
We are not going anywhere.

01:08:16.323 --> 01:08:17.192
I'll be back.

01:08:22.831 --> 01:08:24.596
Oh, yeah, I know.

01:08:24.599 --> 01:08:26.331
Dad, I know.

01:08:26.332 --> 01:08:27.567
Yeah, they said they're gonna
call when they're finished.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:29.268
So they're probably
not done yet.

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:31.303
One minute.

01:08:31.305 --> 01:08:32.474
Give me a minute, please.

01:08:34.774 --> 01:08:36.643
Yeah, no that's what
I'm saying is I wish

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.243
I wouldn't have pussied
out of the whole thing

01:08:38.246 --> 01:08:39.881
'cause that chick
was so fuckin' hot.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.749
Yeah, the one that
rented the place.

01:08:43.952 --> 01:08:46.451
God, if they would have kept
her alive, I, I would have...

01:08:47.822 --> 01:08:49.457
Damnit, one second, Dad.

01:08:52.926 --> 01:08:54.193
Hi.

01:09:25.926 --> 01:09:26.929
Fuck yeah!

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:44.376
How many did you kill?

01:09:44.377 --> 01:09:45.145
All of them.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:56.192
Well, I hear we got some, too.

01:09:57.024 --> 01:09:57.893
You...

01:09:59.661 --> 01:10:01.361
Followed us?

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:02.331
Who are you?

01:10:03.497 --> 01:10:05.233
I run the motel, sweetheart.

01:10:07.935 --> 01:10:08.804
Jimmy's dad.

01:10:10.872 --> 01:10:13.309
Wasn't easy getting
him to agree to this.

01:10:14.475 --> 01:10:17.043
Terry and Christine,
on the other hand,

01:10:17.045 --> 01:10:18.346
they were mature about it.

01:10:24.819 --> 01:10:27.957
There was simpler
times, sweetheart.

01:10:29.356 --> 01:10:31.726
I grew up running
through these halls,

01:10:32.961 --> 01:10:36.298
swimming in the pool,
meeting the guests.

01:10:37.532 --> 01:10:40.369
This place has been in my
family for generations.

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:44.370
That used to mean
a lot, you know?

01:10:44.372 --> 01:10:45.407
Generations.

01:10:46.608 --> 01:10:48.310
Leaving somethin'
for your children.

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:50.913
Jimmy.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:53.849
Tino.

01:10:56.784 --> 01:10:59.451
People are supposed to work and

01:10:59.453 --> 01:11:01.523
earn their convenience, bitch.

01:11:02.623 --> 01:11:04.490
You and everybody like you,

01:11:04.492 --> 01:11:07.492
you think you're
entitled to everything.

01:11:07.494 --> 01:11:09.495
You forget about us.

01:11:09.497 --> 01:11:12.467
We made this bed and
you're fuckin' us in it.

01:11:13.835 --> 01:11:16.436
You think you can phase me out?

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:19.738
Huh?

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.441
No, ma'am.

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:22.378
Not me.

01:11:23.845 --> 01:11:24.713
Not Briskman.

01:11:31.853 --> 01:11:33.355
LA BnB.

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:36.589
L-A-B-N-B.

01:11:36.591 --> 01:11:38.057
Fuck.

01:11:38.059 --> 01:11:41.827
Who really wants strangers
staying in your house?

01:11:41.829 --> 01:11:46.065
Who wants to open themselves
up to that kind of scrutiny?

01:11:46.067 --> 01:11:49.768
We do that here, and we want to.

01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:51.039
It's our job.

01:11:51.905 --> 01:11:53.973
It's our pleasure.

01:11:53.975 --> 01:11:57.977
We give you a couple
nights in peace,

01:11:57.979 --> 01:12:02.115
HBO, breakfast from six to ten.

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:05.884
We smile when you walk
in the front door.

01:12:05.886 --> 01:12:08.420
We care about you here.

01:12:08.422 --> 01:12:09.425
Are you kidding?

01:12:10.658 --> 01:12:13.793
This is the kind of place people
sleep with their clothes on

01:12:13.795 --> 01:12:15.928
and wear flip flops
in the shower.

01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:19.098
You think people actually
want to stay here?

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:20.002
They don't.

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:24.437
You know how long we've
been in this town, bitch?

01:12:24.439 --> 01:12:25.604
Don't call me that.

01:12:25.606 --> 01:12:28.840
Do you know how many guests
have stayed here, bitch?

01:12:28.842 --> 01:12:30.643
Don't call me that.

01:12:30.645 --> 01:12:34.045
I have run this motel
for more than 30 years.

01:12:34.047 --> 01:12:37.450
Who gives you the right
to take that away from me?

01:12:37.452 --> 01:12:38.787
Those girls you killed...

01:12:40.454 --> 01:12:41.457
They have families,

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:43.958
they have lives!

01:12:45.059 --> 01:12:47.927
Casualties for the cause.

01:12:47.929 --> 01:12:49.896
Martyrs for the masses.

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:52.764
And what cause
is that exactly?

01:12:52.766 --> 01:12:53.635
Money?

01:12:55.537 --> 01:13:00.505
You know, you have a really,
really nice fucking house.

01:13:00.507 --> 01:13:02.144
This is war, sweetheart.

01:13:04.979 --> 01:13:07.612
The news gave me the idea.

01:13:07.614 --> 01:13:10.450
A driver for one of
those ride share scams

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:12.488
was accused of molestation.

01:13:13.454 --> 01:13:15.021
It was trending.

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:17.022
Molestation was trending.

01:13:17.024 --> 01:13:18.793
Now, you think about that.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:24.464
If we could make the news
and taint the LA BnB name,

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:26.866
we could win our
reputation back.

01:13:26.868 --> 01:13:29.838
We would have something to
leave for the next generation.

01:13:31.472 --> 01:13:33.876
You did all of this so
you could get on the news?

01:13:35.676 --> 01:13:39.644
You make it grisly enough
and you're primetime, baby.

01:13:39.646 --> 01:13:41.848
If you're primetime,
people listen.

01:13:43.885 --> 01:13:46.652
We are primetime, bitch.

01:13:46.654 --> 01:13:48.487
We're fucking primetime.

01:13:48.489 --> 01:13:50.490
Who the fuck are you?

01:13:51.658 --> 01:13:53.492
I'm Killer Kate.

01:14:23.123 --> 01:14:24.158
You're soaked.

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.934
Hey, I'm really sorry about
your bachelorette party.

01:14:41.676 --> 01:14:42.644
It's not your fault.

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:50.118
We'll have to tell Mel
and Sara's families.

01:14:54.655 --> 01:14:55.957
Sara just got married.

01:15:01.695 --> 01:15:02.797
Funerals.

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:07.636
Memorials at the school.

01:15:09.570 --> 01:15:11.806
The news is probably
gonna wanna talk to us.

01:15:14.007 --> 01:15:15.610
I can't wait to see Trent.

01:15:17.612 --> 01:15:18.614
Who's Trent?

01:15:19.747 --> 01:15:20.816
This guy from work.

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.753
I wonder if I'll
have to go to court

01:15:27.755 --> 01:15:29.257
for all those people I killed.

01:15:31.225 --> 01:15:33.161
I don't even know
how that stuff works.

01:15:35.329 --> 01:15:37.932
It was self-defense, you
didn't do anything wrong.

01:15:44.838 --> 01:15:46.675
I love you.

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:49.677
I love you, too.

01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:00.989
Let's go see Dad.

01:16:04.158 --> 01:16:09.164
Yeah.

01:16:14.637 --> 01:16:19.637
