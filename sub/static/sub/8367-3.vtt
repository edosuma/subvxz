WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.190
Jake Green.

00:03.190 --> 00:04.550
How you doing, man?

00:04.810 --> 00:07.040
--Wait a minute, where the hell you been?
--Around.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.390
Jake, no one's been around for five years.

00:09.390 --> 00:10.530
Seriously...

00:10.930 --> 00:12.030
where have you been?

00:13.330 --> 00:14.080
Hey, brother.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.780
--What you put this family through....
--Johnston, for God's sake...

00:16.785 --> 00:19.792
--Now, he could've been...
--You could spend a week talking
about what I could've been, all right?

00:19.792 --> 00:23.405
--Stay one more day.
--I gotta get back to San Diego by tomorrow.

00:24.804 --> 00:28.466
All right, looks like the explosion
came from the west,  maybe Denver.

00:30.418 --> 00:33.196
--Are we under attack?
--This could've be a test, could've been an accident.

00:33.198 --> 00:33.963
Hi, Dale.

00:34.127 --> 00:36.053
Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel, but we...

00:36.056 --> 00:37.920
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:37.925 --> 00:38.892
I am so sorry.

00:38.897 --> 00:41.751
--I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
--She was in Atlanta.

00:41.756 --> 00:42.990
Oh, my God!

00:43.276 --> 00:47.052
--My mom died yesterday.
--I think my mom died yesterday, too.

00:47.425 --> 00:49.033
Get April. We'll meet you at the medical center.

00:49.037 --> 00:50.892
There's an empty prison bus out there.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.032
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident,

00:53.037 --> 00:55.143
but if it was an attack, Sheriff...

00:55.466 --> 00:56.940
...there's chaos out there,

00:57.185 --> 00:58.582
you might not want the wrong people knowing

00:58.586 --> 00:59.950
that Jericho was still here.

01:00.988 --> 01:01.822
Riley!

01:03.668 --> 01:05.262
Is there anybody on this channel?

01:05.507 --> 01:06.723
There are men here with guns.

01:06.725 --> 01:08.623
I think they might have killed the sheriff.

01:09.035 --> 01:11.102
Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air?

01:11.107 --> 01:15.002
--Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho.
--How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?

01:15.006 --> 01:16.602
Because I was a cop in St. Louis

01:16.607 --> 01:18.580
and after 9-11, we got up to speed.

01:18.585 --> 01:20.280
How long before the radiation gets here?

01:20.285 --> 01:22.853
How long does it normally take a storm to
get here from Denver?

01:22.855 --> 01:23.902
Less than two hours.

01:23.906 --> 01:26.422
Everyone over here can go to the town hall shelter.

01:26.427 --> 01:28.483
All those on the north side will go to the clinic.

01:28.815 --> 01:29.841
Our shelter's no good.

01:30.085 --> 01:31.433
I'm bringing these people to town hall.

01:31.435 --> 01:32.303
They can't come in here, Jake.

01:32.305 --> 01:34.053
--What do you mean they can't come in here?
--We're packed.

01:34.056 --> 01:35.622
The salt mine, how many people will it hold?

01:35.628 --> 01:36.920
We have to seal the entrance.

01:36.926 --> 01:37.920
There's no door, Jake.

01:37.928 --> 01:39.903
Well, we can't just let the rain
pour down the shaft.

01:39.906 --> 01:41.020
These people won't be safe.

01:41.126 --> 01:42.203
We're all clear.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.263
--What's happening out there?
--I don't know.

01:45.265 --> 01:46.492
You always know something.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.760
You know, don't ask me questions.

03:12.195 --> 03:13.371
She's still not talking.

03:14.668 --> 03:15.602
I get that.

03:16.318 --> 03:17.641
I mean, I'm a cop.

03:18.097 --> 03:19.671
I've never killed anybody.

03:20.275 --> 03:21.460
She'a schoolteacher.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.773
Where's Stanley?

03:26.195 --> 03:28.943
Jake, my brother doesn't know about the radiation.

03:29.528 --> 03:30.740
When the rain stops,

03:30.985 --> 03:32.340
he'll be back, don't worry.

03:32.877 --> 03:34.100
Bonnie, I know Stanley.

03:34.108 --> 03:34.930
He'll be fine.

03:36.647 --> 03:37.872
Jake, I got your brother.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.683
--He's with your dad.
--Finally.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.360
--Eric, how's Dad?
--He's good.

03:43.975 --> 03:45.513
The town hall shelter is secure.

03:47.105 --> 03:48.790
Listen, Jake, where are you?

03:49.038 --> 03:50.233
I'm at the Richmond's.

03:50.385 --> 03:51.263
As soon as the rain stops,

03:51.267 --> 03:53.643
get every digging tool you can
find and get to the mine

03:53.825 --> 03:55.960
I had to blow the entrance to keep the rain out.

03:55.966 --> 03:58.500
These people have been sealed up way too long.

03:59.186 --> 04:00.720
And I'm more worried the explosion

04:00.726 --> 04:02.871
might have put some debris into the ventilator.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.641
Enough to slow it down?

04:04.885 --> 04:06.222
Enough to shut it down.

04:06.386 --> 04:07.541
We got to get them out.

04:08.928 --> 04:10.330
We can't reach anyone at the mine.

04:10.338 --> 04:12.572
We have no radio contact with anyone there.

04:13.526 --> 04:15.422
Here, honey, take a little sip.

04:15.778 --> 04:17.622
Okay, just a little. Pass it on.

04:19.765 --> 04:21.572
Good, you guys, good.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.420
Good,  good, good.

04:24.868 --> 04:25.701
One second.

04:26.025 --> 04:27.073
I'll be right back.

04:27.097 --> 04:27.953
Excuse me.

04:30.427 --> 04:31.083
Hey.

04:32.475 --> 04:34.391
--How you holding up?
--Oh, Heather.

04:34.396 --> 04:36.570
I think our students
are taking it better than I am.

04:37.185 --> 04:39.821
They just know there's nothing to be afraid of.

04:40.177 --> 04:41.812
For them, it's just like a bad field trip.

04:42.106 --> 04:43.920
I'll be fine.

04:43.928 --> 04:46.141
--Just having a hard time breathing.
--It's all right.

04:46.147 --> 04:47.770
Here, take a little water.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.050
Yeah.

04:50.467 --> 04:51.383
Good.

04:51.417 --> 04:52.652
I have to get outside.

04:52.867 --> 04:53.852
Soon.

04:54.216 --> 04:54.671
Soon.

04:54.675 --> 04:57.350
--Is Mr. Rennie okay?
--He's gonna be fine.

04:57.355 --> 04:59.903
We just need to give him
a little bit of room, okay?

05:00.025 --> 05:00.751
Go on back.

05:01.677 --> 05:02.731
I can't do this!

05:02.736 --> 05:04.502
--Got to get outside!
--It's okay.

05:04.507 --> 05:06.393
Deep breath, deep breath.

05:26.288 --> 05:27.370
You doing all right?

05:29.936 --> 05:31.692
Stupid question?

05:32.485 --> 05:33.250
Right.

05:35.365 --> 05:37.170
How do you know the rain's radioactive?

05:38.305 --> 05:39.693
Denver's pretty far away.

05:40.925 --> 05:43.323
Well, we don't know how many bombs there were,
we don't know...

05:48.765 --> 05:49.681
What is it?

05:49.916 --> 05:51.190
Someone's up in the house.

05:51.478 --> 05:52.771
Not more prisoners?

06:12.037 --> 06:13.813
--Stanley!
--Bonnie, thank God.

06:13.817 --> 06:14.511
No! Hey, hey!

06:14.516 --> 06:15.521
No! Uh-uh.

06:17.096 --> 06:18.333
Stanley, don't touch her.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.261
The rain may be radioactive.

06:53.755 --> 06:55.953
April, Stanley seems to be okay.

06:56.695 --> 06:58.972
I'd say he was in it for about 20 minutes.

06:58.976 --> 07:00.993
Yeah, I was out at my cousin's

07:00.995 --> 07:02.471
helping  him put the livestock up

07:02.478 --> 07:03.510
and got caught in it.

07:03.888 --> 07:04.872
Is he vomiting?

07:04.875 --> 07:06.173
No, he's not.

07:06.235 --> 07:08.323
Okay, do you have any iodine there?

07:09.315 --> 07:10.510
Bonnie, iodine?

07:13.958 --> 07:15.270
Hey, what's with all the tanks?

07:16.848 --> 07:17.620
What tanks?

07:18.816 --> 07:20.260
On my way home, I passed a line of tanks.

07:20.268 --> 07:21.610
They were hauling ass towards Denver.

07:21.616 --> 07:23.400
Stanley, how many tanks did you see?

07:23.407 --> 07:25.563
--Five, maybe.
--Where?

07:25.565 --> 07:26.430
They were over the ridge.

07:26.436 --> 07:28.193
I couldn't tell you
exactly where they were.

07:29.037 --> 07:31.300
But I was on Pharr's Mill Road near I-70.

07:32.987 --> 07:34.480
April, we have iodine.

07:34.675 --> 07:36.890
He's going to need to take
a couple of tablespoons.

07:36.896 --> 07:37.512
But it tastes vile,

07:37.515 --> 07:38.881
so do you have any bread,

07:38.882 --> 07:40.355
something that he could take with it?

07:40.434 --> 07:41.766
We're in a cellar-- all we've got

07:41.768 --> 07:43.546
is canned peaches and pickles.

07:43.727 --> 07:44.640
Not the pickles.

07:44.987 --> 07:46.011
Maybe the peaches.

07:46.017 --> 07:48.292
Jake, just give me the iodine.

07:49.037 --> 07:50.741
The second that the rain breaks,

07:50.745 --> 07:52.102
rush him to the clinic.

07:54.705 --> 07:55.803
And, Jake...

07:58.028 --> 08:00.061
if he throws up in the next couple of hours

08:00.315 --> 08:01.971
get  Bonnie out of that room.

08:02.246 --> 08:03.011
Why?

08:03.206 --> 08:05.663
Because her brother's going to die.

08:22.858 --> 08:25.472
--Just concentrate on breathing, please
--I can't.

08:25.846 --> 08:26.440
Got to get out of here.

08:26.447 --> 08:28.262
--I know. Soon.
--I got to get out of here!

08:28.267 --> 08:30.373
Mr. Rennie, please, just concentrate
on your breathing.

08:30.845 --> 08:31.650
Look at me.

08:33.145 --> 08:33.951
Controlled.

08:33.957 --> 08:34.871
Very...

08:34.888 --> 08:36.380
--I got to get out of here.
--I know, Mr...

08:36.385 --> 08:37.400
I got to get out of here!

08:37.405 --> 08:38.311
I don't want to die down here!

08:38.315 --> 08:39.293
Get me out of here!

08:39.355 --> 08:40.842
--I don't want to be here!
--Look, everybody just calm down.

08:40.846 --> 08:42.630
There's nothing to worry about.

08:42.638 --> 08:44.422
--You're scaring the children, Scott.
--I can't breathe.

08:44.807 --> 08:47.263
--He's claustrophobic.
--We got to get him out of here.

08:46.636 --> 08:48.182
--Look, it's me.
--I'm sorry.

08:48.185 --> 08:50.071
It's Shep. Try to focus, man

08:50.077 --> 08:51.580
--try to focus.
--I got to get out of here!

08:51.748 --> 08:53.751
--We got to get him away from these people.
--I got to get out of here!

08:53.766 --> 08:54.653
I can't breathe!

08:54.948 --> 08:57.793
--I don't want to die down here!
--Please be careful!

08:58.446 --> 08:59.190
Please!

08:59.316 --> 09:00.240
Stay back.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.282
I don't want to die down here!

09:04.296 --> 09:05.471
I don't...

09:05.486 --> 09:06.591
Get me out of here!

09:14.575 --> 09:16.930
--Jake wants to talk to you.
--His cough's getting much worse.

09:16.935 --> 09:19.302
--I want you to make it brief.
--Okay, okay.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.542
Yeah, son, what is it?

09:21.548 --> 09:24.630
Dad, Stanley saw a line of tanks near I-70.

09:24.637 --> 09:26.303
Well, you know, there's a National Guard unit

09:26.307 --> 09:27.710
to the southwest of there in Goodland.

09:27.715 --> 09:29.501
Maybe they've got a relief effort going.

09:29.506 --> 09:30.910
We need to get out there and see.

09:30.915 --> 09:33.073
That could be a dangerous thing to do, son.

09:33.078 --> 09:35.403
Can't just sit around and wait
to find out what's happening.

09:35.615 --> 09:36.411
I'll go to Goodland.

09:36.415 --> 09:38.213
Someone should check out Topeka.

09:38.497 --> 09:39.593
Okay, son.

09:45.158 --> 09:46.093
I'm going with you.

09:46.516 --> 09:47.241
What?

09:47.547 --> 09:48.593
I have to find Roger,

09:48.595 --> 09:50.101
--and Goodland's on the way to Wichita.
--You're in no condition to...

09:50.105 --> 09:50.961
I'm going.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.920
With you or I'm going by myself.

10:00.805 --> 10:01.640
For the last time,

10:01.715 --> 10:02.791
you can't smoke here.

10:07.998 --> 10:11.092
--waters for everyone.
--Thank you, honey.

10:11.326 --> 10:15.541
--Johnston, I need to take your temperature again.
--Oh, you just took it five minutes ago.

10:15.605 --> 10:17.332
--Shh...
--Hasn't changed in five minutes.

10:17.336 --> 10:20.491
--The mighty Johnston Green felled by the flu.
--Here it comes.

10:20.496 --> 10:21.460
I don't know if I told you this

10:21.465 --> 10:23.212
but my father is impervious to mere germs.

10:23.217 --> 10:26.101
--Oh, really?
--Yeah, I believe that was the quote.

10:26.105 --> 10:28.821
--First inauguration-- have it all on video.
--It was a joke.

10:28.828 --> 10:29.490
I was trying to...

10:29.497 --> 10:31.502
April, don't ever make a mistake.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.872
This  family will never let you forget it.

10:33.936 --> 10:35.171
Okay, I'll remember that.

10:35.896 --> 10:39.030
--Oh, come on.
--But still...
--Shh, Johnston.

10:45.167 --> 10:46.382
I don't like him.

10:49.127 --> 10:49.983
Me neither.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.162
Here.

11:10.257 --> 11:11.493
They're really stale.

11:38.095 --> 11:39.972
You know, I keep thinking about

11:40.626 --> 11:41.572
when we were kids

11:41.578 --> 11:44.332
and how they used to make us practice

11:44.337 --> 11:45.802
hiding under our desks

11:45.807 --> 11:47.702
in case of an atomic bomb.

11:48.855 --> 11:50.540
Yeah, duck and cover.

11:51.507 --> 11:52.602
That's the first thing I thought of

11:52.606 --> 11:54.560
when I saw that mushroom cloud.

11:56.857 --> 11:59.702
Did they have enough time
to hide under their desks?

12:02.565 --> 12:04.502
That's pretty stupid, huh?

12:07.228 --> 12:08.140
No.

12:18.295 --> 12:19.223
Eric?

12:20.758 --> 12:22.062
I'm just a little confused.

12:22.446 --> 12:24.371
Your wife isn't really acting like someone

12:24.376 --> 12:26.360
--who knows the marriage has
been dead a long time.
--Mary...

12:26.367 --> 12:27.861
Or did I get the wrong impression?

12:31.388 --> 12:33.412
Mary, let's just get through this, okay?

12:33.416 --> 12:34.553
Well, the next thing you're gonna tell me

12:34.556 --> 12:36.490
is that she actually does understand you.

12:38.495 --> 12:39.441
I'm sorry.

12:49.668 --> 12:53.000
Jake, don't let Bonnie see your lips.

12:56.486 --> 12:57.173
Listen, man.

12:57.175 --> 12:59.021
If this thing doesn't turn out so good--

12:59.365 --> 13:02.003
--the thing is, Bonnie's still just a kid, so...
--Stanley.

13:02.275 --> 13:03.131
Don't even, all right?

13:03.137 --> 13:05.023
--You're  gonna be fine.
--I don't know.

13:06.355 --> 13:07.721
My head is pounding and I feel like

13:07.725 --> 13:08.921
I'm gonna throw up.

13:19.646 --> 13:21.012
Eric, the rain has stopped.

14:17.618 --> 14:18.750
What's this black stuff?

14:19.916 --> 14:21.353
That used to be Denver.

14:30.075 --> 14:33.091
--Bill, Emily, get Stanley to the medical clinic now.
--Okay.

14:33.095 --> 14:34.472
Find April, she'll know what to do.

14:34.476 --> 14:36.930
--Jimmy, you're coming with me to ne, all right?
--Jake.

14:38.036 --> 14:40.143
--I meant what I said, all right?
--I know.

14:40.527 --> 14:42.303
Look, I know, I know.

14:42.308 --> 14:44.670
I will help you find Roger.
--I promise, okay?

14:44.675 --> 14:46.491
Go, I'll meet you at the medical clinic.

14:46.498 --> 14:48.042
Eric, we're coming to the mine now.

14:48.045 --> 14:49.881
We have to dig those people out.

15:11.896 --> 15:12.760
What was that?!

15:15.836 --> 15:17.513
I think somebody's on the other side.

15:31.118 --> 15:32.490
Get these people out of here.

15:40.477 --> 15:41.640
All right, everyone,

15:42.177 --> 15:43.370
you're gonna be okay.

15:47.136 --> 15:48.751
All right, we have food and water.

15:49.787 --> 15:51.271
And there are vehicles waiting for you guys

15:51.275 --> 15:52.962
to take you to the clinic, all right?

15:53.455 --> 15:54.140
Nice and slow.

15:54.145 --> 15:55.920
File out, these guys'll help you.

15:56.316 --> 15:57.563
Listen, you're okay.

15:57.616 --> 15:59.431
Women and children first.

16:00.738 --> 16:04.242
Please. Watch your step, everyone, be careful.

16:05.696 --> 16:07.021
It's gonna be okay.

16:06.658 --> 16:09.022
--Are you okay?
--I think so.

16:17.105 --> 16:18.770
Gray, what happened?

16:19.718 --> 16:21.051
He's dead.

16:23.255 --> 16:24.241
What?

16:45.918 --> 16:46.451
Hey.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.971
--Hey, how's Stanley?
--We're still watching him.

16:48.978 --> 16:49.461
Where is he?

16:49.466 --> 16:51.393
--We had to isolate him.
--Where? Where is he?

16:59.266 --> 17:00.111
What the hell?

17:01.308 --> 17:02.203
Do you like it?

17:02.686 --> 17:04.310
It's where they make the contagious kids wait

17:04.317 --> 17:06.102
so they don't give everybody chicken pox.

17:06.566 --> 17:08.690
--Did you throw up?
--Yeah, a couple times.

17:10.257 --> 17:12.913
Apparently, that's what happens
when you drink a bottle of iodine.

17:14.656 --> 17:15.891
I need to get back to the house.

17:15.896 --> 17:17.363
I need to check on the livestock.

17:17.367 --> 17:18.271
I need to check on the corn.

17:18.275 --> 17:19.121
I need to get out of here.

17:19.125 --> 17:22.329
--There's really nothing you can do right now.
--He's right.

17:23.017 --> 17:25.570
--You need to stay.
--Yeah...

17:25.766 --> 17:28.671
I'm really sick of being poked with
needles every ten minutes.

17:29.647 --> 17:32.040
They'll be sorry when my spider powers kick in.

17:37.687 --> 17:41.372
Well, you're still an idiot,
so that's a good sign.

17:41.425 --> 17:42.480
Yeah.

17:44.677 --> 17:46.102
How bad is it?

17:46.105 --> 17:48.413
Well, you're sleep deprived
like everyone else.

17:48.808 --> 17:50.482
Bring the bandages to 102.

17:50.546 --> 17:52.852
No, I mean the radiation.

17:53.265 --> 17:54.033
Am I dying?

17:54.035 --> 17:56.091
--Have you vomited?
--No. Should I?

17:56.376 --> 17:59.300
--You just need some rest; go home.
--I'd like to.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.550
When's the next flight to D.C.?

18:01.556 --> 18:02.691
Dr. Green?

18:03.347 --> 18:04.541
Oh, there are a lot of people waiting.

18:04.545 --> 18:07.481
--If you could just...
--I just want to know what happened to my friend.

18:07.878 --> 18:08.920
Scott Rennie.

18:09.706 --> 18:12.002
It looks like he had a heart attack.

18:12.875 --> 18:13.893
I'm sorry.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.191
But...

18:30.687 --> 18:31.971
So what if I have three queens,

18:31.975 --> 18:33.802
but I only have two jacks?

18:36.487 --> 18:39.120
--I'm out.
--I so bluffed you.

18:43.375 --> 18:45.271
--Skylar, are you still alive in there?
--Hey, what's up?

18:45.907 --> 18:46.802
Sky, are you home?

18:47.385 --> 18:49.093
--Hello?!
--Hey...
--Hey...

18:49.097 --> 18:49.890
--Dude, I'm starving.
--What's up?

18:50.786 --> 18:53.240
--Oh, my God.
--What's he doing here?

18:53.245 --> 18:55.003
This is not how it looks.

18:55.547 --> 18:57.273
It sure looks how it looks.

18:59.046 --> 18:59.870
Skylar, wait.

18:59.876 --> 19:01.202
That guy's a weirdo.

19:02.786 --> 19:04.622
I can't just sit around here all day.

19:04.626 --> 19:05.951
We've got to find the sheriff and his men,

19:05.955 --> 19:10.463
--we've got to get the power back on.
--Okay, now you're going to stay here
as long as it takes.

19:10.726 --> 19:12.813
Now, don't make me take your pants with me.

19:13.247 --> 19:15.621
--I can run this town without my pants.
--It wouldn't be the first time.

19:15.627 --> 19:17.203
--Huh.
--All right.

19:18.055 --> 19:19.671
That's a story I never want to hear.

19:20.007 --> 19:21.271
Sweetheart.

19:21.915 --> 19:23.041
How are you feeling, honey?

19:23.048 --> 19:24.822
My leg's a little sore, but...

19:25.136 --> 19:26.380
how's everything here?

19:26.425 --> 19:28.620
--Your father has the flu.
--It's nothing.

19:29.426 --> 19:30.860
Did you hear Mr. Rennie died?

19:31.136 --> 19:32.232
It's terrible.

19:32.996 --> 19:33.892
I've been thinking,

19:34.217 --> 19:36.740
more than anything, this town needs information.

19:37.565 --> 19:39.241
We could organize a group of people.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.391
Send them out in every direction.

19:40.397 --> 19:43.561
--I don't think anyone should be leaving Jericho.
--We have to.

19:44.086 --> 19:46.090
We can't just sit here in the dark.

19:46.127 --> 19:47.162
He's right.

19:48.486 --> 19:50.132
Makes us too vulnerable.

19:53.458 --> 19:56.600
Abrams, you and Crossfield are taking
the northern route

19:56.607 --> 19:59.451
up through Nebraska to the state police
barracks in Broken Bow.

19:59.456 --> 20:00.821
Well, I can go east to Topeka

20:00.827 --> 20:02.201
and connect with the state government.

20:02.207 --> 20:03.963
Ridley can head west to Denver.

20:03.965 --> 20:06.143
Well, what's left of it.

20:06.146 --> 20:08.521
You'll probably run into a ring
of FEMA and EMS people

20:08.528 --> 20:10.140
before you even get within sight of the city.

20:10.146 --> 20:11.083
See what they know.

20:11.276 --> 20:12.042
What about you?

20:12.118 --> 20:13.861
He's going to Wichita with me.

20:14.237 --> 20:17.833
That's right, Emily and I are taking the
southern route to Wichita.

20:18.626 --> 20:21.233
Well, let's try to radio back as much information

20:21.238 --> 20:22.150
as possible along the way.

20:22.158 --> 20:22.973
That's the plan.

20:22.976 --> 20:24.712
Hitting the major cities in each direction

20:24.718 --> 20:26.980
north, south, east and west.

20:27.255 --> 20:30.792
--The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
--Let's hope not.

20:34.387 --> 20:36.373
Nope, we've still got static.

20:36.397 --> 20:37.921
Try pointing it east.

20:38.365 --> 20:39.171
We've got nothing,

20:39.177 --> 20:40.113
keep moving it.

20:40.517 --> 20:42.143
Nope, just static.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.773
Just keep trying.

20:43.885 --> 20:44.792
Mary.

20:47.605 --> 20:48.643
Excuse me.

20:49.067 --> 20:49.943
Mary.

20:54.568 --> 20:55.533
Man.

20:56.197 --> 20:57.401
Busy place.

20:58.038 --> 21:01.553
Yeah, although the service
isn't what it used to be.

21:01.718 --> 21:02.810
What'll you have?

21:03.095 --> 21:03.660
Oh, my God.

21:03.855 --> 21:04.832
We've got something!

21:23.218 --> 21:24.663
--Where'd it go?
--Come on, bring it back!

21:33.215 --> 21:34.202
We're losing the feed!

21:34.206 --> 21:36.753
--Bring it back!
--Go back. We had something.

21:47.548 --> 21:48.823
Was that Korean?

21:49.125 --> 21:51.211
--Does anybody know?
--I think it was Chinese.

21:51.217 --> 21:52.191
It  was Mandarin.

21:52.405 --> 21:54.221
The question is, were they just reporting it

21:54.227 --> 21:55.290
or were they behind it?

21:55.297 --> 21:56.602
Did Stanley say if there were any markings

21:56.606 --> 21:57.900
--on the side of the tank?
--No.

21:57.905 --> 22:01.623
--I mean, maybe we're being invaded.
--Abrams and Crossfield are out.

22:01.918 --> 22:04.372
--They won't drive into a war zone.
--Yeah, well, I don't blame them.

22:04.496 --> 22:06.392
Look, why don't we put this plan
on hold right now?

22:06.396 --> 22:07.442
We saw one image;

22:07.598 --> 22:08.600
we'll probably see another one.

22:08.606 --> 22:10.672
Going out is more important
than ever, all right?

22:10.675 --> 22:11.650
If this country is at war,

22:11.657 --> 22:12.723
we need to know it.

22:16.277 --> 22:18.922
Okay, we have Los Angeles,
Seattle and Philadelphia.

22:19.057 --> 22:21.691
--What else did you see on the TV?
--I think Seattle's wrong.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.371
--Okay. Uh, could it have been Portland?
--I don't think so.

22:27.258 --> 22:28.033
Hey.

22:28.376 --> 22:30.941
--I understand you lost some of your men?
--Yeah.

22:30.947 --> 22:33.103
Need a volunteer, I'm available.

22:33.325 --> 22:36.151
--Thanks, Mister...
--Hawkins.

22:36.628 --> 22:38.002
Mr. Hawkins.

22:38.308 --> 22:40.441
--Do you have a family?
--Two kids.

22:40.447 --> 22:41.731
I think it's best if we stick to people

22:41.737 --> 22:43.193
who don't have families.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.791
Hey. Em?

22:56.427 --> 23:00.610
Um, excuse me? Mr. Cale?

23:02.737 --> 23:04.390
Something's been bothering me.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.903
It's about Mr. Rennie's death.

23:10.235 --> 23:12.603
The mine was full of people from the clinic.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.280
How come nobody called for a doctor?

23:16.737 --> 23:18.442
I don't want to talk about it.

23:20.046 --> 23:21.282
I know you're upset.

23:22.696 --> 23:22.692
You guys were close.

23:24.128 --> 23:25.232
But he was my friend, too.

23:25.238 --> 23:28.202
I... I worked with him for three years.

23:28.205 --> 23:29.613
Hey, Shep?

23:29.948 --> 23:31.322
We're heading out for supplies.

23:31.328 --> 23:32.352
Why don't you give us a hand?

23:37.628 --> 23:40.072
You know, this whole thing
has been pretty hard on Shep.

23:40.077 --> 23:42.321
He lost a good friend today.

23:43.565 --> 23:44.531
We all did.

23:51.557 --> 23:52.311
Emily?

24:00.895 --> 24:01.933
Talk to me.

24:02.916 --> 24:03.982
Was it the broadcast?

24:03.988 --> 24:06.790
--Because we don't know
what any of it means.
--They got Wichita.

24:06.798 --> 24:08.392
Roger is dead.

24:08.398 --> 24:11.150
--We don't know that.
--I saw it on the map.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.953
--Your fianc?might have made it.
--How?

24:14.136 --> 24:16.782
What if his flight got diverted to Des Moines?

24:17.465 --> 24:18.722
Des Moines' gone.

24:19.517 --> 24:22.952
Emily, what if it was Omaha, huh? Or Tulsa.

24:23.198 --> 24:25.780
What if they set down in the middle of
a cornfield in Nebraska?

24:25.785 --> 24:26.973
He could be anywhere.

24:26.977 --> 24:28.922
Plane went down trying
to find a place to land.

24:28.928 --> 24:32.892
--What if it exploded?
--Emily.
--What if he's dead?

24:33.448 --> 24:36.220
--He's gone, and I'm here with you.
--Emily.

24:36.227 --> 24:39.692
You were supposed to be the one
that was dead... not him.

24:40.538 --> 24:42.000
Just leave me alone, Jake.

24:43.835 --> 24:45.073
Go without me.

25:03.895 --> 25:05.083
They took everything.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.420
Oh, Dale.

25:08.276 --> 25:09.320
Thank God.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.383
I looked everywhere for you.

25:13.527 --> 25:14.751
Are you all right?

25:15.095 --> 25:16.380
I was so worried.

25:17.427 --> 25:19.482
--I was safe.
--Good.

25:20.508 --> 25:21.783
Gracie?

25:21.948 --> 25:23.782
Oh, what now?

25:24.566 --> 25:25.792
Gracie?

25:26.086 --> 25:27.470
We're closed, Gail.

25:27.818 --> 25:30.010
--I'm out of everything.
--That's why I'm here.

25:30.225 --> 25:32.543
Some of the folks at the shelter brought
some stuff back,

25:32.546 --> 25:33.610
and I thought you could use it.

25:33.618 --> 25:34.990
It's one box.

25:35.318 --> 25:36.811
I'm out of business.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.670
My train shipment was supposed
to come through on Tuesday.

25:39.675 --> 25:41.553
Without a delivery, these shelves are gonna stay

25:41.556 --> 25:43.320
as empty as they are right now.

25:43.695 --> 25:45.710
I don't have a freezer anymore.

25:46.065 --> 25:51.863
--Most of this stuff is going
to go bad any minute now.
--I know. Food's going bad all over town.

25:53.756 --> 25:55.572
I need my shipment.

25:56.368 --> 25:59.070
But we don't know if we'll ever
get the power back on.

26:00.498 --> 26:01.890
Maybe we should cook it.

26:02.327 --> 26:05.223
--What?
--Yeah. Everything, all of it.

26:06.027 --> 26:08.111
As long as it's still good enough to eat.

26:27.155 --> 26:28.023
Are you okay?

26:31.256 --> 26:33.493
If you call radiation poisoning okay.

26:33.745 --> 26:35.263
Were you out in the rain, too?

26:35.318 --> 26:36.720
Oh, heavens, no.

26:37.035 --> 26:40.413
I touched a building
when we came out of the shelter.

26:40.996 --> 26:41.821
Oh.

26:43.375 --> 26:45.721
Look, you can stop pretending.

26:46.185 --> 26:47.143
What do you mean?

26:48.636 --> 26:50.213
I audited your farm.

26:51.577 --> 26:52.731
Why do you care?

26:54.997 --> 26:56.661
Maybe I'm a nicer person than you.

26:58.067 --> 26:58.901
Right.

27:00.697 --> 27:02.031
Were you in the rain?

27:02.627 --> 27:04.571
Yeah, for about 20 minutes.

27:05.905 --> 27:08.730
--Well, you look pretty good.
--Thanks.

27:09.797 --> 27:11.122
Try to work out.

27:16.627 --> 27:20.750
Look, um... you know I think
I got the worst of it.

27:20.756 --> 27:22.753
So as long as I'm okay,

27:23.088 --> 27:24.493
you should be fine.

27:25.538 --> 27:26.641
You're really sweet.

27:28.896 --> 27:33.132
--And you still owe the IRS $180,000.
--Yeah, I know.

27:59.915 --> 28:01.973
-- Every radio needs to be fully charged.

28:01.978 --> 28:04.052
We'll stay in contact as long as we can.

28:04.056 --> 28:07.052
Gray, the long-range ones are all charged.

28:07.056 --> 28:09.222
--They're in the storage unit.
--All right, thanks.

28:09.496 --> 28:10.530
Ridley, why don't you go

28:10.535 --> 28:12.302
pack up the Geiger counters and the flares?

28:12.307 --> 28:13.481
I'll meet you out there.

28:14.235 --> 28:17.361
Gray, I just wanted to tell you

28:17.367 --> 28:19.113
how much I appreciate what you're doing.

28:20.406 --> 28:20.820
It's a gutsy move, and, uh,

28:20.988 --> 28:23.150
--the whole town thanks you.
--Yeah, thanks.

28:23.155 --> 28:25.402
What the hell happened out there?

28:25.775 --> 28:27.563
I've known Scott Rennie his whole life.

28:27.567 --> 28:28.601
He's strong as an ox.

28:28.605 --> 28:29.741
I just...

28:30.265 --> 28:31.853
I can't believe he's dead.

28:32.156 --> 28:33.651
He was a good man.

28:33.658 --> 28:37.873
--Heart attack at his age.
--Yeah, well, it wasn't a heart
attack that killed him.

28:38.406 --> 28:41.003
--What do you mean?
--It was poor planning.

28:41.658 --> 28:42.640
What are you talking about?

28:42.648 --> 28:45.380
What I'm saying is that none of this
would have happened

28:45.386 --> 28:47.192
if that clinic shelter had been maintained.

28:47.196 --> 28:49.261
--You have a lot of people to answer to.
--All right, that's enough.

28:49.267 --> 28:50.700
No, that's not nearly enough.

28:50.706 --> 28:52.911
I get back here, there's gonna be an investigation.

28:52.918 --> 28:54.060
Hundreds of people could have died

28:54.065 --> 28:54.890
'cause you dropped the ball.

28:54.895 --> 28:58.552
--Why don't we talk about this in my office?
--You dropped the ball, and it killed Scott Rennie.

28:58.768 --> 29:00.472
In my office. Now.

29:10.356 --> 29:13.242
Right now these people need our leadership.

29:13.246 --> 29:15.670
I will not have you tearing this town apart.

29:15.926 --> 29:17.210
And when all this is over,

29:17.216 --> 29:18.212
if you and I are still alive,

29:18.217 --> 29:19.963
you investigate your ass off.

29:19.966 --> 29:22.680
In the meantime, if I hear any more talk like that out of you,

29:22.687 --> 29:24.603
you and I are gonna have a problem.

29:25.205 --> 29:27.052
Do we understand each other?

30:04.178 --> 30:06.392
--Where's Emily?
--She's not going.

30:06.826 --> 30:07.712
Good.

30:08.826 --> 30:11.412
--You're not going alone, are you?
--Yeah.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.591
Don't give me that look.

30:14.597 --> 30:17.171
--What look?
--You know what look. That look.

30:17.176 --> 30:19.582
Hey, I told you 7,500 times

30:19.585 --> 30:21.073
I have watched you drive away

30:21.078 --> 30:22.942
not knowing if you were coming home.

30:23.198 --> 30:24.741
I've earned a look.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.281
I'm coming back.

30:32.557 --> 30:33.551
Let's go!

30:33.755 --> 30:34.661
Ridley?

30:38.218 --> 30:39.281
Come on.

30:40.428 --> 30:41.573
Shep?

30:41.675 --> 30:43.231
Taking Ridley's place.

30:43.357 --> 30:44.341
Going to Denver.

30:45.225 --> 30:46.670
You don't have to do this.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.803
What about your family?

30:50.867 --> 30:52.082
I got to get out of here.

30:52.645 --> 30:54.050
Shep, you'll get past this.

30:54.977 --> 30:55.723
Yeah?

31:19.028 --> 31:22.112
--Hey, Heather.
--Oh.

31:22.396 --> 31:25.823
--Shep left this for you.
--Thanks.

31:37.547 --> 31:38.493
"Dear Heather,

31:38.845 --> 31:41.280
"I want you to know the truth about Scott Rennie.

31:41.676 --> 31:42.691
"It was my fault.

31:43.165 --> 31:44.832
"Gray wanted me to keep him quiet,

31:44.835 --> 31:46.090
"and his heart went out.

31:46.576 --> 31:49.131
"I should have called
for a doctor, but I was scared.

31:49.265 --> 31:50.273
"I let him die.

31:51.008 --> 31:52.372
"I'll never forgive myself.

31:52.888 --> 31:54.131
"You were a good friend to Scott.

31:54.137 --> 31:56.043
"A better friend than I ever was.

31:57.157 --> 31:58.280
Shep."

32:16.136 --> 32:18.191
Well, they should be about 50 miles out by now.

32:18.227 --> 32:20.672
Jake, are you still reading me? Jake?

32:23.265 --> 32:24.421
I lost him.

32:25.166 --> 32:27.513
Shep, are you there? Shep?

32:28.407 --> 32:31.332
Eric, do me a favor.

32:32.545 --> 32:34.182
I missed that last one, Shep.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.221
Can you say it again?

32:36.216 --> 32:37.490
Tell him I'm sorry.

32:39.617 --> 32:40.981
Tell the family I'm sorry.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.582
You're breaking up, Shep.

32:43.617 --> 32:45.350
Hey, Gray, did you catch that?

32:45.947 --> 32:46.962
No.

32:48.087 --> 32:49.432
No, I didn't.

33:58.127 --> 34:02.360
--I don't know, that would make about 45 miles.
--Right, so, in about an hour...

34:03.305 --> 34:06.572
--Jake, what are you doing back?
--You should be in Wichita by now.

34:06.576 --> 34:09.541
--Smoky Hill Bridge is blocked.
--What is that?

34:10.315 --> 34:11.882
It's a flight data recorder.

34:12.005 --> 34:14.371
--I thought they were supposed to be black.
--Well, where'd you get it?

34:14.556 --> 34:15.710
A couple of pilots used the highway

34:15.717 --> 34:17.840
as a landing strip with mixed results.

34:17.996 --> 34:20.641
--This is the only one I could get.
--Were there any survivors?

34:23.946 --> 34:25.873
It was a commuter plane that didn't make it,

34:26.217 --> 34:28.001
a 757 that was empty.

34:28.456 --> 34:30.051
Well, where are they?

34:30.056 --> 34:31.139
Where'd they go?

34:33.088 --> 34:34.270
How do we listen to this?

34:34.275 --> 34:36.692
--Do you have that old reel-to-reel laying around?
--Yeah.

34:36.696 --> 34:37.822
Your father needs to hear this.

34:37.827 --> 34:38.880
I'm going to go get him.

34:39.255 --> 34:42.601
--You okay?
--Yeah. I'm a little freaked.

34:53.888 --> 34:54.873
Dad's here.

34:56.737 --> 34:59.531
I've gone through most of this recording
from the plane that crashed.

34:59.766 --> 35:01.862
This is the last 30 seconds or so.

35:01.947 --> 35:03.960
A lot of background noise. You can hear...

35:04.208 --> 35:07.351
pilots from planes in the area
talking to each other.

35:08.555 --> 35:09.653
Wait.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.203
The kids.

35:11.217 --> 35:13.803
Oh, yeah. Come on, girls. Let's go.

35:25.937 --> 35:27.151
Is anyone on this frequency?

35:27.157 --> 35:28.772
There's no reply from ATCC!

35:29.015 --> 35:32.683
Please advise. Ray-27 in emergency descend,
need coordinates for approach.

35:33.938 --> 35:35.931
Give me full flaps; it's about to get bumpy.

35:35.936 --> 35:39.823
This is Chinook 116 heavy.
Missed our handoff to Kansas City ATCC.

35:39.828 --> 35:41.342
Does anyone read us? Over.

35:42.086 --> 35:44.720
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6, reading you.

35:44.878 --> 35:46.060
We're bingo fuel,

35:46.068 --> 35:47.832
lost all VFR heading out of Chicago.

35:47.838 --> 35:50.633
Tried all frequencies; there's no one out there.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.050
What does that mean?

35:51.556 --> 35:53.280
They're out of gas and blind.

35:52.496 --> 35:54.422
Guys, this is Primary 221.

35:54.427 --> 35:59.081
I've got a mushroom cloud 16 kilometers
in height somewhere northwest over Denver.

35:59.087 --> 36:01.350
I've got a visual on two separate plumes--

36:01.358 --> 36:04.400
one over in Kansas City and one south somewhere in Texas.

36:04.406 --> 36:09.241
--Does anyone read ATC?
--Negative. There is no ATCC anymore, Chinook.

36:08.485 --> 36:10.480
He's saying there's no traffic control.

36:10.647 --> 36:13.132
There's 10,000 planes with no place to land.

36:13.437 --> 36:15.711
That's about a million people in the air.

36:15.886 --> 36:18.000
Whoa! Are those F-16s?

36:18.005 --> 36:19.423
Right. Do you have a visual?

36:19.425 --> 36:22.682
Affirm. Prime Missouri Guard. 131st out of Landburg.

36:22.786 --> 36:24.221
These guys are hauling ass somewhere.

36:24.228 --> 36:26.751
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.

36:26.948 --> 36:28.483
We found a stretch of highway long enough.

36:28.485 --> 36:30.072
Follow us in. Setting down

36:30.076 --> 36:32.132
On final approach, stand by.
Here we go.

36:32.527 --> 36:34.130
Flaps, I need more flaps.

36:34.955 --> 36:36.033
Losing it.

36:36.358 --> 36:37.573
I can't hold it.

36:37.847 --> 36:38.343
We're sliding here.

36:38.345 --> 36:41.513
--Pull up! Pull up!
--I can't...!

36:47.878 --> 36:50.290
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.

36:50.296 --> 36:52.281
We found a stretch of highway long enough.

36:56.566 --> 36:58.830
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.

36:58.835 --> 36:59.951
We found a...

37:01.577 --> 37:04.103
--Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
--Trans Shore...

37:04.106 --> 37:05.893
We found a stretch of highway long...

37:06.925 --> 37:08.160
Emily, come here.

37:09.838 --> 37:13.870
--Roger was on Trans Shore 724, right?
--Yes.

37:13.896 --> 37:14.792
Listen.

37:15.926 --> 37:18.483
--This is primary...
--Jake, what is this?
--Just listen.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.592
My co-pilot's blind. Background chatter.

37:27.425 --> 37:30.772
--Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
--This is Trans Shore 724.

37:30.777 --> 37:33.373
We've set down in a field, GPS malfunctioned.

37:33.378 --> 37:35.630
I think we're north of Kansas. Minor injuries.

37:38.946 --> 37:42.202
He's alive. He's alive.

37:58.277 --> 38:00.380
(I said If you...)

38:08.627 --> 38:09.760
Robert?

38:12.375 --> 38:15.073
There's, uh, music outside.

38:16.316 --> 38:18.930
--Yeah.
--Yeah, the party.

38:20.486 --> 38:22.761
Sounded like Sam Cooke from here, but, uh

38:23.098 --> 38:25.231
there's a chance it could be Kenny Rogers.

38:25.918 --> 38:27.153
Oh, Lord.

38:29.285 --> 38:31.283
Robert, the kids would like to go.

38:35.058 --> 38:37.463
--To the party?
--Yes.

38:39.978 --> 38:41.140
We're not ready.

38:41.898 --> 38:43.340
--Robert.
--No.

38:44.018 --> 38:44.862
No.

39:07.185 --> 39:12.303
(Mm-hmm, mm-hmm)

39:13.517 --> 39:15.730
(I can see it in your eyes)

39:15.735 --> 39:17.181
(and feel it in your touch)

39:17.188 --> 39:19.300
(I know that you're scared)

39:19.306 --> 39:24.231
(But you've never been this loved )

39:24.648 --> 39:26.530
(Mm-hmm)

39:28.108 --> 39:30.200
(It's a long shot, baby)

39:30.207 --> 39:31.861
(I know it's true)

39:31.867 --> 39:33.903
(But if anyone can make it)

39:33.907 --> 39:38.843
(I'm betting on me and you...)

39:39.685 --> 39:42.262
Well, I'm glad there was enough food for everyone.

39:42.265 --> 39:45.421
I just wish someone would've said thank you.

39:42.625 --> 39:47.933
(Just keep on moving into me)

39:48.295 --> 39:51.371
(I know you're gonna see)

39:51.678 --> 39:55.733
(the best is yet to come)

39:57.148 --> 40:00.503
(Don't fear it now)

40:00.507 --> 40:04.513
(We're going all the way)

40:03.435 --> 40:06.243
Oh, it looks delicious.

40:04.907 --> 40:11.961
(The sunshining would've said thank you
on a brand-new day)

40:11.966 --> 40:15.142
(It's a long way down)

40:15.146 --> 40:18.013
(And it's a leap of faith)

40:18.018 --> 40:22.221
(But we're never giving up)

40:22.227 --> 40:29.643
('Cause I know we've got a once-in-a-lifetime love)

40:23.508 --> 40:24.372
Thanks.

40:32.668 --> 40:34.142
She looks so much better.

40:37.278 --> 40:38.840
You really made her happy.

40:40.348 --> 40:44.020
--I owed her.
--Well, I'd say this makes you even.

40:44.326 --> 40:45.920
Not even close.

40:48.316 --> 40:51.503
(So don't hold back now)

40:51.505 --> 40:57.351
(Just let go of all you've ever known...)

40:57.028 --> 40:59.442
You haven't said two words all night.

40:57.037 --> 41:03.032
(You can put your hand in mine )

41:02.337 --> 41:03.901
Just taking it all in.

41:03.567 --> 41:09.561
(We're going all the way)

41:04.687 --> 41:08.831
It might be a long time before
we see Jericho like this again.

41:10.006 --> 41:17.392
(Well, the sun is shining on a brand-new day)

41:17.397 --> 41:20.481
(It's a long way down)

41:20.487 --> 41:23.670
(And it's a leap of faith)

41:23.676 --> 41:26.970
(But we're never giving up...)

42:16.656 --> 42:18.062
I got to go.

42:20.277 --> 42:21.731
What time is it?

42:22.895 --> 42:25.151
It's a little past midnight.

42:25.835 --> 42:27.573
Do you really have to go?

42:30.095 --> 42:32.131
Yeah, I should probably go.

42:38.807 --> 42:44.051
(That starts to overwhelm-
whelm-whelm-whelm-whelm)

42:46.696 --> 42:48.033
(Ooh, ooh)

42:50.616 --> 42:52.563
(Ooh, ooh)

42:55.078 --> 42:56.692
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

42:59.115 --> 43:02.271
(And there it goes)

43:02.507 --> 43:06.551
(My last chance for peace)

43:07.447 --> 43:10.443
(You let me down)

43:11.275 --> 43:13.901
(But I get no release)

43:13.907 --> 43:16.073
(And I say I)

43:16.216 --> 43:18.881
(I try to keep awake)

43:20.196 --> 43:23.263
(I try to swim beneath)

43:24.197 --> 43:26.020
(I try to keep awake)

43:26.025 --> 43:33.771
(But I, I can feel this narcolepsy slide)

43:33.778 --> 43:36.101
(Into another nightmare)

43:49.207 --> 43:51.143
(And there's a demon in my head)

43:51.146 --> 43:54.440
(who starts to play a nightmare tape loop)

43:54.447 --> 43:56.053
(of what went wrong yesterday)

43:56.058 --> 43:58.000
(And I hold my breath till)

43:58.007 --> 44:00.002
(it's more than I can take...)

44:01.305 --> 44:07.267
