00:23.958 --> 00:24.916
Julio Saldenha?

00:25.666 --> 00:27.416
-That's me.
-Please come in.

00:28.083 --> 00:28.916
Thank you.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.083
So you do your business in here.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.125
Yeah.

00:33.208 --> 00:36.166
If you have trouble,
we have a collection of magazines.

00:36.250 --> 00:38.250
The instructions are on the card.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.916
Little wipes, just in case.
And don't steal the remote.

00:41.791 --> 00:45.250
Bring the cup
to the nurses' station when it's full.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.250
-Okay. Thanks.
-Here.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.208
I'll do that.

00:48.291 --> 00:49.375
Sorry.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.000
I'm here to help him come.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.833
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:54.375 --> 00:56.166
THE LAME PLAN

00:56.250 --> 00:57.625
THE CRAZY PLAN

00:57.708 --> 01:00.000
THE BOOTY PLAN

01:00.083 --> 01:02.000
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

01:02.083 --> 01:04.416
<i>Hello, pretty shepherdess. May I sit here?</i>

01:04.500 --> 01:07.333
<i>-I've got a big goat cheese.</i>
-How'd you get mixed up in this?

01:07.416 --> 01:08.916
Brad Pitt was unavailable.

01:10.458 --> 01:12.541
No, but when I showed up at the agency,

01:13.041 --> 01:14.875
they thought I was auditioning.

01:14.958 --> 01:19.000
And they insisted
that I be the shepherd and do the music.

01:19.083 --> 01:20.541
I mean, the music.

01:21.375 --> 01:24.416
I figured, "Okay, double the pay,
I can pay the rent,"

01:24.500 --> 01:26.166
so I took the opportunity.

01:26.708 --> 01:29.375
-That goat is so pretty.
-I mean, it's a goat.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.500
You know what, my love?
I'm really proud of you.

01:33.583 --> 01:34.666
Stop messing around.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.541
No, for real.

01:37.333 --> 01:38.333
Wait, Julio.

01:38.416 --> 01:40.458
Thank you, goat.

01:40.541 --> 01:41.708
I'm singing the tune.

01:42.916 --> 01:44.583
You know the place is huge.

01:44.666 --> 01:47.500
It'll take a year of work.
She wants it done in six months.

01:47.583 --> 01:48.666
-For real?
-Yeah.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.166
I made her think
I have a bunch of employees.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.916
But how will you manage?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.041
I'm going to make her think
Matt works for me.

01:56.125 --> 01:59.500
A star like her, in this village,
it's like Michael Jackson.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.208
Prices will skyrocket. We can't sell now.

02:02.791 --> 02:03.750
You think so?

02:04.458 --> 02:07.750
I didn't tell you, but you know
the hospital management job?

02:08.458 --> 02:10.791
Where I applied before I met Nicole?

02:10.875 --> 02:13.250
-Well, they're hiring me.
-Really? That's great.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.458
Yeah, it's awesome.

02:15.041 --> 02:17.541
But it's in Paris. So we have to go back.

02:18.958 --> 02:20.833
-Yeah.
-That's what you wanted.

02:20.916 --> 02:21.916
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.541
-Of course, yeah.
-That's awesome.

02:24.625 --> 02:25.833
Yeah, it's awesome.

02:28.750 --> 02:32.000
<i>Love is a Bohemian bird</i>

02:32.083 --> 02:35.708
<i>That has never, never known love</i>

02:35.791 --> 02:37.583
<i>Little bird, little bird</i>

02:37.666 --> 02:38.875
Max.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.833
<i>Little bird, how I love you</i>

02:41.916 --> 02:43.333
Shut up! Please.

02:43.875 --> 02:45.000
I need to talk to you.

02:45.625 --> 02:46.541
Talk to me?

02:46.625 --> 02:49.000
-I need to tell you something.
-Is it serious?

02:49.666 --> 02:50.583
Kind of, yeah.

02:51.625 --> 02:54.750
Did we lose points in the polls? Fuck!

02:54.833 --> 02:56.041
No, that's not it.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.916
I need to tell you.
Otherwise, I'm going to lose my mind.

03:01.791 --> 03:02.625
Okay.

03:04.708 --> 03:05.541
I'm dumping you.

03:08.000 --> 03:08.833
Seriously?

03:10.041 --> 03:11.041
Fuck.

03:13.416 --> 03:14.458
Fuck.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.458
This is what being dumped feels like?

03:28.000 --> 03:28.833
So…

03:31.041 --> 03:32.541
it's just that I…

03:33.416 --> 03:34.541
Could you sit down?

03:39.625 --> 03:41.000
We need to admit it.

03:41.083 --> 03:44.000
The whole lockdown mess
is what brought us closer.

03:44.083 --> 03:46.625
I was going through a rough time.
You were there.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.208
And after that,

03:48.291 --> 03:49.875
it was us against the world.

03:51.666 --> 03:54.166
But I believed in it. I swear.

03:54.250 --> 03:58.000
Except you don't treat me as an equal,
and I can't see myself in this.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.458
You and me,

04:00.541 --> 04:02.583
it's pretty, it looks great in pics…

04:04.500 --> 04:06.666
but you can't build a life on a hashtag.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.250
And now, it's time I took care of myself.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.541
You understand?

04:12.500 --> 04:13.708
Well, I…

04:13.791 --> 04:15.458
Yes. No. I don't know.

04:18.791 --> 04:19.875
And the campaign?

04:20.416 --> 04:21.416
How will I manage?

04:21.916 --> 04:25.958
-Fuck.
-No, I was kidding.

04:27.125 --> 04:29.333
Can you tell the others I dumped you?

04:37.083 --> 04:38.291
Now she regrets it.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.125
So you already miss it?

04:42.625 --> 04:47.125
CHANTAL
GOOGLE YOURSELF NOW, DICKHEAD!

04:47.208 --> 04:48.041
Charlotte!

04:49.333 --> 04:50.166
Cha!

04:50.250 --> 04:54.166
Ovarian insufficiency
and endometriosis, that's just…

04:54.250 --> 04:55.375
that really sucks.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.125
-So it's my fault, then?
-Hang on.

04:58.958 --> 05:01.291
Regarding you, sir,

05:02.458 --> 05:05.583
your sperm isn't exactly Napoleonian

05:05.666 --> 05:09.333
when it comes to valiancy,
combativity, and all that.

05:09.416 --> 05:13.291
I see a few of them are swimming,
so we should be able to do something here.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.083
See, it's my fault too.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.125
Well, it's mostly the lady here.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.333
Listen, in my opinion, it's very simple.

05:20.416 --> 05:23.958
We need ovarian stimulation
in preparation for an IVF.

05:24.541 --> 05:25.625
And

05:26.625 --> 05:27.708
could it work?

05:28.333 --> 05:31.041
You know, fertility is like a big lottery.

05:31.541 --> 05:32.958
There are no certitudes.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.250
With a little bit of magic,
you can make it work.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.333
Now, just to clarify,

05:38.416 --> 05:41.041
you should know
that stimulation leads to a kind of

05:41.541 --> 05:43.625
emotional rollercoaster.

05:43.708 --> 05:47.833
We have seen women get the urge
to end their life quite violently.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.166
-Really?
-That bad.

05:50.250 --> 05:54.041
It's important for you to know
since you will have to deal with her.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.250
She might get a little complicated.

05:56.333 --> 05:58.083
-No.
-Well, yes.

05:58.583 --> 05:59.458
Anyway.

05:59.541 --> 06:04.000
I'm sure she has girlfriends?
A tight-knit circle?

06:04.083 --> 06:05.750
-Yes.
-I suppose.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.666
Yes.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.500
Great, shall we go for it?

06:08.583 --> 06:09.416
Yes?

06:10.125 --> 06:11.583
Why?

06:11.666 --> 06:13.250
MAXIME PAUILLAC'S FAKE FARMER

06:13.333 --> 06:14.458
Why?!

06:14.958 --> 06:19.333
You could have worn any other costume!
Why did you choose this one to go party?

06:21.458 --> 06:23.750
I just didn't think
anyone would recognize me.

06:23.833 --> 06:26.708
Then again,
you should've just had a solid project.

06:26.791 --> 06:27.875
Okay, Cha.

06:27.958 --> 06:31.708
I know you just dumped me,
but could you please support me right now?

06:31.791 --> 06:33.208
-You dumped him?
-Yeah.

06:33.291 --> 06:34.500
Finally! Thank God.

06:35.375 --> 06:36.500
Shit, you guys are…

06:37.416 --> 06:38.333
This is hard.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.791
<i>I'm going to come.</i>

06:40.875 --> 06:43.041
Are you sure
this is the time to watch porn?

06:43.708 --> 06:45.500
Hang on, I think

06:45.583 --> 06:48.666
the bad buzz around
the fake farmer is snowballing.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.041
I mean, there are balls.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.833
-Wait, this is you!
-What?

06:52.916 --> 06:53.875
This is your…

06:53.958 --> 06:55.333
-His dick, yeah.
-Yeah.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.500
What do you mean, my dick?

06:57.583 --> 06:58.750
Very smart.

06:58.833 --> 07:01.791
It's funny, from this angle,
it looks like it's a lot more…

07:01.875 --> 07:03.083
Yeah…

07:03.166 --> 07:05.541
<i>I'm going to come!</i>

07:05.625 --> 07:07.333
No, this is a conspiracy.

07:08.125 --> 07:09.458
This is the Green guy.

07:09.541 --> 07:11.333
He wants to sink me in the polls.

07:12.125 --> 07:16.208
I sent one video of my dick
to a girl because she asked me for it!

07:16.291 --> 07:19.416
I mean, I felt that she wanted it, so…

07:19.500 --> 07:22.458
All our former colleagues
from city hall are joining in.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.458
So, Cécile says you're "a pig."

07:25.541 --> 07:26.583
Karine?

07:26.666 --> 07:28.333
Karine? She has some nerve.

07:28.416 --> 07:31.625
She's the one teasing everyone,
walking around in a crop top.

07:31.708 --> 07:33.083
A BIG JERK!
#RATOUTYOURPAUILLAC

ASSHOLE FORMER COLLEAGUE
FAKE ON ALL LEVELS

07:37.000 --> 07:39.041
Hashtag "Rat out your Pauillac."

07:39.125 --> 07:40.875
At least people are talking about you.

07:40.958 --> 07:42.750
Okay, this is too much for me.

07:44.041 --> 07:44.916
Cha?

07:50.458 --> 07:53.125
So, can I dump you too?

07:53.208 --> 07:55.125
Because three months
before the first vote,

07:55.208 --> 07:56.500
I don't see what we can do.

07:57.458 --> 07:58.458
Apart from a sex tape.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.333
That could work?

08:01.916 --> 08:04.250
-Come on. Let's get out of here.
-No, but…

08:06.583 --> 08:09.333
You stole all the trash bags?
I spent an hour looking for them.

08:09.416 --> 08:13.416
It's both hideous
and very artistic. It's troubling.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.750
A cross between
a slum and a stall at an art fair.

08:15.833 --> 08:18.125
Come on. Go ahead, Eddy.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.416
Look, your pacifier toy.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.583
-Hi, Eddy.
-See you.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.166
Kisses.

08:24.375 --> 08:25.375
Yeah?

08:26.041 --> 08:29.458
I want your opinion on how
to announce my pregnancy to my followers.

08:29.541 --> 08:31.083
Hang on. Take a look.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.333
What do you think?

08:34.041 --> 08:35.666
-Yeah.
-Not bad. Otherwise, this.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.250
-Yeah.
-Or this.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.333
Or this. See?

08:39.958 --> 08:42.458
But with little booties
on the belly. Cute, right?

08:42.541 --> 08:44.875
But it won't look
the same at all with you.

08:45.375 --> 08:46.458
Why not?

08:46.541 --> 08:48.625
-Why do you say that?
-I have no ideas.

08:48.708 --> 08:51.833
-I have no opinion.
-Please, it's super important.

08:51.916 --> 08:54.541
I'm a momtrepreneur! A mompreneur!

08:54.625 --> 08:57.791
I have to be successful
professionally and maternally.

08:57.875 --> 08:59.708
People need to see it, so…

08:59.791 --> 09:01.958
You think I'm the right person?
Call the girls.

09:02.041 --> 09:02.875
No.

09:05.625 --> 09:08.083
-You're doing a transference.
-What? Not at all.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.125
You miss them.

09:09.208 --> 09:11.416
-You want me to replace your BFFs.
-No.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.291
I don't miss them, so no.

09:13.375 --> 09:15.333
Well, thanks. See you.

09:15.416 --> 09:17.875
-Eddy, Mommy's transferring.
-Not at all!

09:18.875 --> 09:20.250
-You ready to do this?
-Yeah.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.000
You feel okay? You're relaxed?

09:22.083 --> 09:23.541
-Just jab me.
-You sure?

09:24.416 --> 09:26.500
-So I'm doing it?
-Do it.

09:27.458 --> 09:28.333
There.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.166
It's over.

09:31.666 --> 09:32.666
You okay?

09:32.750 --> 09:34.125
I didn't feel a thing.

09:34.208 --> 09:38.166
No, usually, with my fear of needles,
it's the girls who…

09:41.416 --> 09:42.625
Who…

09:43.208 --> 09:45.958
-Is the emotional roller coaster starting?
-Not at all.

09:46.041 --> 09:48.583
I swear,
this isn't going to affect me. I'm sure.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
My love, you need to sleep.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.500
How do you expect me to sleep?

10:04.375 --> 10:06.250
See, it's crazy.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.958
This animal is so close to us,
and nobody knows.

10:09.541 --> 10:12.958
And it's not really a human or a plant.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.416
Or an animal. See?

10:15.500 --> 10:16.791
Yeah.

10:16.875 --> 10:18.083
I mean, it's a blob.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.916
But don't you have
a big work thing tomorrow?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.458
Fuck, get off my back!

10:24.541 --> 10:26.000
I know what I'm doing.

10:26.916 --> 10:29.166
How convenient that it just happens

10:29.250 --> 10:32.375
to be the woman who has to deal
with the hard stuff during IVF!

10:34.166 --> 10:36.000
Being a caregiver is all or nothing.

10:36.083 --> 10:39.000
If you've lost your vocation,
I won't hold you back.

10:39.083 --> 10:41.166
But it'll be hard on the patients.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.875
I hope they haven't grown
attached to your ugly mug.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.500
-My ugly slow mug.
-Yeah.

10:47.666 --> 10:50.583
And nobody can blame you
for wanting to talk to a computer.

10:51.375 --> 10:55.125
No, Nicole, that's not it.
I think I'm too old for this.

10:55.208 --> 10:58.291
Right, for giving up your life
to protect others?

10:58.375 --> 11:01.750
-Yeah, you're definitely too old for this.
-No, it's just…

11:05.416 --> 11:07.375
Sorry, I have to take this.

11:08.708 --> 11:09.625
Hello?

11:09.708 --> 11:12.000
<i>Congrats, bro, on the job in Paris.</i>

11:12.083 --> 11:12.916
Thanks.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.250
But you're not calling about that.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.416
<i>You've been congratulating me</i>
<i>by text for 32 years.</i>

11:18.375 --> 11:19.833
No, I… Well…

11:20.916 --> 11:24.000
I also wanted to tell you
that I finally dumped Maxime.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.250
Everyone will be happy.

11:25.333 --> 11:26.166
JUST CANCER

11:26.250 --> 11:28.333
Okay, great. And you?

11:28.416 --> 11:29.666
Are you okay?

11:31.541 --> 11:33.625
Yeah, I'm good. Great.

11:33.708 --> 11:35.333
<i>Listen, I have to go.</i>

11:35.416 --> 11:37.416
I can't really talk. I'm in a bookstore.

11:38.125 --> 11:39.166
Okay, bye.

11:40.208 --> 11:45.250
And I was diagnosed with a little lump,
a little cancer, but it's nothing.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.541
<i>It's teeny-tiny. Okay?</i>

11:47.041 --> 11:48.708
<i>Don't worry. I'm doing great.</i>

11:48.791 --> 11:49.958
Love you!

11:53.750 --> 11:55.500
Shit…

11:56.250 --> 11:57.333
This isn't happening.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.250
Yes, Antoine.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.916
Where are you? I'm coming.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.875
<i>No, please don't.</i>

12:06.958 --> 12:08.250
Please, Antoine.

12:08.916 --> 12:11.333
I just wanted you to know, to be there.

12:11.875 --> 12:14.083
I need to handle this alone,
you understand?

12:14.625 --> 12:19.375
I need to know that
I can count on you to count on me.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.958
I can't do that, Charlotte.

12:22.041 --> 12:22.916
<i>I can't.</i>

12:24.375 --> 12:26.166
But I need you to do it for me.

12:27.291 --> 12:29.250
<i>And I need you to keep this to yourself.</i>

12:29.750 --> 12:33.250
Otherwise, it's not this stupid lump
that's going to kill me.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.291
It's the pity in people's eyes.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.833
I'm stronger than that. You know?

12:42.625 --> 12:47.000
<i>So now, you're going to keep</i>
<i>taking care of people who really need it.</i>

12:47.083 --> 12:48.083
And

12:48.875 --> 12:51.458
I'm going to start
taking care of myself, for real.

12:52.416 --> 12:53.250
Okay?

12:55.041 --> 12:58.833
All right, but you'll never stop me
from taking care of you, Charlotte.

13:02.000 --> 13:02.833
I know.

13:05.791 --> 13:06.625
Okay.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.208
<i>See you, best bro </i>del mundo.

13:09.291 --> 13:10.708
See you, little sister.

13:21.375 --> 13:23.291
Wear that jacket. You look slimmer.

13:23.375 --> 13:24.583
It's great. Come on.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.583
Hey. Harvey Weinstein's here.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.750
-Hi.
-I hope you're proud of yourself.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.625
What's he doing here?

13:32.250 --> 13:33.125
I need asylum.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.291
Just two weeks. I need people to forget.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.750
Girls in Paris
are spitting on me in the street.

13:37.833 --> 13:38.916
Don't you like that?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.708
You think this toxic, dysfunctional
male role model is good for Eddy?

13:42.791 --> 13:44.833
Don't worry about Eddy. He's a feminist.

13:44.916 --> 13:46.208
He's the generation after Z.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.708
Come to think of it, what is that?
Is it Generation A?

13:48.791 --> 13:51.041
Does it start over? I don't know.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.916
-You want political asylum?
-Please.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.125
Give me your phone.

13:54.666 --> 13:57.750
As long as you're in my home,
you do what I want. Give it.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.500
Go dress like Matt.

13:59.583 --> 14:02.458
You're going to pretend to work for me.
I'll explain in the car.

14:05.625 --> 14:06.833
-In the garage.
-Yes.

14:07.541 --> 14:09.291
And brush your hair, this won't do.

14:10.375 --> 14:14.208
And then, they leave Roger the Frog,
like two little blowhards,

14:14.291 --> 14:16.833
and they end up
in front of the jellyfish tank.

14:16.916 --> 14:18.250
And then, he says to her,

14:19.500 --> 14:20.500
"I want you."

14:21.083 --> 14:22.250
The girl hesitates,

14:24.083 --> 14:26.750
so he tells her,
"Come on, don't be a whore!"

14:32.041 --> 14:33.041
That's awesome!

14:36.500 --> 14:37.750
No, guys, stop it.

14:38.375 --> 14:39.458
Stop.

14:39.541 --> 14:41.416
I've seen a lot of boring stuff.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.083
All of Vivaldi's operas,
my sister's dance recitals,

14:44.166 --> 14:47.291
and even my father's
dermatology conferences, but this!

14:48.625 --> 14:51.166
Doesn't it bother you
that it's based on Julio and me?

14:51.750 --> 14:54.458
It's got nothing to do with it.
It's not a man whore.

14:54.541 --> 14:57.416
When they told me
your boyfriend used to be a man whore,

14:57.500 --> 15:00.166
honestly, my respect
for you seriously went up.

15:01.041 --> 15:04.041
-What's gotten into you?
-Shut the hell up!

15:04.916 --> 15:08.416
Piotr must be turning over in his…
He must be stirring because it's ashes.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.166
Nothing, just like his foundation.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.791
So I'm out of here.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.166
There. I quit!

15:15.000 --> 15:16.916
No, because… Why help women?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.250
Seriously, it's so easy to be one.

15:19.333 --> 15:20.375
Bunch of losers!

15:21.500 --> 15:22.333
Elsa!

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Elsa, come back.

15:26.833 --> 15:28.541
Wait! Elsa!

15:29.625 --> 15:32.458
I know that your hormones
are having a party right now,

15:32.541 --> 15:33.833
but you went overboard.

15:33.916 --> 15:36.708
Sorry. I was out of ideas,
so I drew inspiration from life.

15:36.791 --> 15:40.416
Are you so desperate that you can't
see Suzanne is manipulating you?

15:40.500 --> 15:42.333
-Where do you get off?
-Yeah.

15:42.416 --> 15:44.541
She's toying with you!

15:44.625 --> 15:47.791
You're like the little dolls
she takes turns French kissing.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.458
Wake the fuck up.

15:52.625 --> 15:53.500
Seriously…

15:53.583 --> 15:56.000
Wait. You and Suzanne? I don't think so.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.291
And you would have told me if she and you…

15:58.375 --> 15:59.458
Same goes for you?

16:00.875 --> 16:02.791
Actually, Suzanne and I are dating.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.041
But it's a secret.

16:04.125 --> 16:04.958
Look.

16:05.791 --> 16:07.458
This morning. From Suzanne.

16:07.541 --> 16:10.750
"My wild pig."
Flame emoji, potato emoji, star emoji.

16:10.833 --> 16:15.791
Okay. From Suzanne. "Your ass. Your ass."
Fingers inside the goat. Sun emoji.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.333
Fuck.

16:19.083 --> 16:19.916
Me first.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.958
-Go ahead, tell her.
-Tell him.

16:26.041 --> 16:26.875
Tell what?

16:28.500 --> 16:29.875
That I slept with both of you?

16:31.625 --> 16:32.583
I'm sorry.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.583
You really think women only have sex
when they have feelings?

16:37.916 --> 16:40.500
So you need labels. It reassures you.

16:40.583 --> 16:44.250
Gay, bi, straight, polyamorous,
pansexual, no one gives a damn.

16:45.291 --> 16:47.458
It's a shame because we were having fun.

16:47.541 --> 16:50.166
You ruined everything
with your couple's obsession.

16:51.541 --> 16:52.833
I'm already bored.

16:52.916 --> 16:54.708
A little advice. Forget about me.

16:54.791 --> 16:56.250
Kisses. Bye.

17:00.416 --> 17:01.958
We're almost done.

17:02.041 --> 17:05.500
About the barn,
what I had in mind based on the plans…

17:05.583 --> 17:07.708
Oh right, these are my Serbian workers.

17:07.791 --> 17:10.083
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Maxime Pauillac, delighted.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.458
-Hello.
-Hello.

17:11.958 --> 17:13.833
How do you find the space here?

17:13.916 --> 17:15.833
Should we create an opening?

17:16.333 --> 17:17.500
It's crazy hot in here.

17:17.583 --> 17:20.083
The opening is a good idea.
You just need a purlin.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.791
-Yeah.
-And you can see your magnolias bloom.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.708
-Yeah.
-I would keep the stone. It's gorgeous.

17:25.791 --> 17:28.166
Yes, they're from Champagne.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.166
-Like in the Louvre.
-Indeed.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.583
-It's magnificent, inspiring.
-It's beautiful.

17:35.791 --> 17:37.166
-There.
-Okay, listen.

17:37.250 --> 17:39.291
Let me show you something in the garden.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.500
-Okay.
-Yes.

17:41.083 --> 17:43.750
No. You'll catch a cold. No, don't bother.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.166
-So you…
-Tell me a little about it.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.333
Near the chapel…

17:47.416 --> 17:48.583
What a nympho.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.625
BREAST SELF-EXAM

18:37.375 --> 18:39.666

19:26.458 --> 19:28.291
We'll put it here. Where do you want it?

19:28.375 --> 19:29.375
Over here, right?

19:29.458 --> 19:30.875
Behind the green.

19:30.958 --> 19:32.375
Behind the green. Come on.

19:40.833 --> 19:41.958
INJECTION REMINDER

19:46.375 --> 19:47.333
Gross.

19:47.416 --> 19:49.583
WINNER
FIRST OUT OF THREE

19:49.666 --> 19:51.083
02/03/1999

FRIENDSHIP PACT

19:58.125 --> 19:59.125
NEVER SPLIT UP

19:59.208 --> 20:01.375
NEVER STEAL EACH OTHER'S BOYFRIENDS
(EVEN AN EX)

20:01.458 --> 20:03.625
NEVER LEAVE ELSA
ALONE FOR A SHOT

20:03.708 --> 20:05.375
NEVER LIE
AND NEVER HIDE ANYTHING

20:07.375 --> 20:12.375
NEVER MAKE OTHERS THINK
THEY'RE NOT IMPORTANT TO US

20:12.458 --> 20:13.875
ELSA EMILIE CHACHA

20:19.291 --> 20:21.666
I CAN'T
I HAVE CHEMO

20:44.000 --> 20:45.541
It's going to be okay.

20:59.833 --> 21:01.958
<i>Hello, my lovely followers!</i>

21:02.041 --> 21:06.791
<i>Today, I have a big surprise for you.</i>

21:06.875 --> 21:09.166
And speaking of big,

21:09.250 --> 21:12.000
the surprise
isn't the only one getting big.

21:12.625 --> 21:17.208
And for this, I decided to do an unboxing.

21:17.791 --> 21:20.291
That way, you can guess.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.958
<i>What is it?</i>

21:24.458 --> 21:27.500
It's little booties

21:28.208 --> 21:30.041
that are really small.

21:30.125 --> 21:33.333
So, that means…

21:38.041 --> 21:39.083
Hi.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.916
-How are you?
-Where were you?

21:44.750 --> 21:46.708
-Paris.
-For the new job?

21:48.166 --> 21:49.083
No.

21:49.166 --> 21:50.083
Not really.

21:54.208 --> 21:56.750
I'm trying to be
happy about it. I'm trying.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.375
But it's not like with Eddy.

22:01.125 --> 22:02.500
Do you really want it?

22:04.458 --> 22:05.875
I don't know.

22:06.875 --> 22:09.125
But he's here.

22:10.625 --> 22:12.375
Maybe the timing is wrong?

22:15.375 --> 22:16.666
Okay, good talk.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.083
No, wait, Milou.

22:20.291 --> 22:21.750
You're right.

22:22.458 --> 22:24.208
It's not the right moment,

22:25.083 --> 22:26.583
but it's you, and it's me.

22:26.666 --> 22:28.583
For nine months, it's mostly me.

22:29.166 --> 22:30.833
Do you not want it anymore?

22:33.458 --> 22:34.958
-I have to go to work.
-Milou.

22:36.750 --> 22:37.833
Look at me.

22:38.833 --> 22:41.041
Whatever you decide, I'm with you.

22:42.041 --> 22:44.958
Everything you're feeling, I'm feeling.

22:45.541 --> 22:46.583
You know that, right?

22:50.583 --> 22:52.791
You know, Matthieu, you really get it.

22:52.875 --> 22:55.666
You're in what is right,
beautiful, and simple.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.583
You know, you're ready.

22:58.666 --> 23:00.125
Ready for what?

23:01.083 --> 23:03.000
Ready for the absolute.

23:03.666 --> 23:05.875
Ready to welcome the achieved dream.

23:06.458 --> 23:07.416
Love.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.333
All right.

23:09.041 --> 23:10.250
Well, awesome.

23:10.333 --> 23:12.833
It's funny,
you chicks today like sensitive guys

23:12.916 --> 23:15.000
that talk about flowers, that cry.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.875
Well, "chicks," as you put it,

23:17.958 --> 23:19.083
well, yes.

23:19.166 --> 23:21.750
Chicks like vulnerable men.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.750
They like men who question themselves.

23:24.833 --> 23:27.333
Who aren't satisfied
with just being themselves.

23:27.416 --> 23:29.583
"Yeah, sorry, but that's the way I am."

23:29.666 --> 23:30.666
They like…

23:31.916 --> 23:33.000
What's going on here?

23:33.750 --> 23:34.875
Someone is crying.

23:34.958 --> 23:35.958
<i>Callate.</i>

23:40.458 --> 23:43.416
Oh dear, you're crying.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.416
What's going on?

23:48.125 --> 23:50.083
Oh, that little face.

23:50.166 --> 23:51.708
Those rosy cheeks.

23:53.416 --> 23:54.666
You're pregnant.

23:58.666 --> 23:59.666
I don't want it.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.125
I don't want it. It's horrible.

24:02.708 --> 24:04.375
I can't stop feeling guilty.

24:05.625 --> 24:06.875
I love my husband.

24:06.958 --> 24:08.291
I love my son.

24:08.375 --> 24:10.375
I have everything to welcome this new kid.

24:10.458 --> 24:12.875
And it's the second baby. Babykins.

24:14.500 --> 24:18.250
I barely had time for the first one,
and now I don't feel up to the task.

24:19.666 --> 24:20.791
I can't do it.

24:21.458 --> 24:23.625
-Do you understand?
-Listen, I…

24:25.125 --> 24:26.750
I never give out advice,

24:27.291 --> 24:29.416
but all I stand for in life is freedom.

24:29.500 --> 24:33.833
You have to take things lightly
and follow your little star.

24:33.916 --> 24:36.000
Anyway, you don't need me.

24:37.291 --> 24:38.416
You've made your choice.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.375
Shit. She wants an abortion?

24:40.458 --> 24:42.750
It's the right choice.

24:42.833 --> 24:44.291
-Shut up.
-Yeah.

24:44.375 --> 24:45.583
It's going to be fine.

24:46.083 --> 24:46.916
Thank you.

24:49.583 --> 24:50.416
Of course!

24:50.500 --> 24:52.958
<i>You'll arrive at the hospital</i>
<i>around 6:00 a.m.,</i>

24:53.041 --> 24:55.250
<i>and if all goes well,</i>
<i>you'll be out the next day.</i>

24:56.833 --> 24:59.000
All right. Great.

24:59.083 --> 25:00.458
I mean, no. Not great.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.750
Do you think that
there could be an earlier appointment?

25:05.250 --> 25:08.750
It feels strange to know
you're living with this thing.

25:08.833 --> 25:11.166
<i>No, but I'll put you on the waiting list.</i>

25:11.250 --> 25:12.500
All right, great.

25:12.583 --> 25:14.166
What are you doing here?

25:14.791 --> 25:16.083
Thank you, miss.

25:17.416 --> 25:18.791
Why are you here?

25:19.375 --> 25:21.041
You know, I had a spare key.

25:21.125 --> 25:22.291
-Yeah.
-That doesn't matter.

25:23.791 --> 25:25.333
I'm here about Emilie.

25:25.416 --> 25:26.541
She needs you girls.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.041
I'm bloated.
I have zits everywhere. I'm just gross.

25:31.125 --> 25:32.333
No, not at all.

25:32.416 --> 25:34.208
And it's the last one. Come on.

25:35.916 --> 25:37.208
There, it's done.

25:37.291 --> 25:38.708
All good. It's over. See?

25:40.458 --> 25:42.375
Well, all that's left is to hope.
