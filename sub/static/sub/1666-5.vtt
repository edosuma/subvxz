13:24.537 --> 13:26.380
You never answer, do you?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.041
Why are you so curious about Davina?

13:28.207 --> 13:31.950
If I had a 16-year-old all-powerful
witch at my beck and call,

13:32.111 --> 13:33.988
you would wonder about her too.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.960
You're never gonna get her.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.858
Okay.

13:40.887 --> 13:43.561
I'll ask the
harmless questions, then.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.031
How did you meet her?

13:45.525 --> 13:46.128
(CHUCKLES)

13:48.328 --> 13:49.864
That might surprise you.

13:50.530 --> 13:54.342
This was eight months ago, before
I banned the witches from using magic.

13:55.234 --> 13:58.044
Relations between vampires and witches

13:58.237 --> 14:00.649
weren't what you'd call friendly,
by any means.

14:00.807 --> 14:04.880
But let's just say,
we were a little less divided.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.422
In fact, some of us were
getting along just fine.

14:24.263 --> 14:25.765
It's so screwed up.

14:25.932 --> 14:29.106
I'm dealing with whacked out,
militant witches.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.248
Hey, you witches all
got a little crazy in you.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.715
And my sister's really
gone off the deep end this time.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.115
Yeah. Jane-Anne has got
martyr written all over her.

14:37.276 --> 14:38.346
That's for sure.

14:38.511 --> 14:42.084
They've got every 16-year-old girl
in our coven dying to be one of the four

14:42.248 --> 14:44.353
chosen for this crazy-ass ritual.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.055
Anything I can do to help?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.600
No. You've caused enough
trouble with them.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.258
What, little, old me?

14:53.126 --> 14:54.230
You're a dick.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.396
You always stir it
up with the witches,

14:56.562 --> 14:59.805
which is why this...

15:02.802 --> 15:04.475
. . stays between us.

15:07.306 --> 15:08.808
KLAUS: <i>You and Sophie.</i>

15:08.908 --> 15:10.819
You hypocrite.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.417
You torture those witches,
and yet there you are,

15:15.581 --> 15:18.152
getting positively Romeo and Juliet
with Sophie Deveraux.

15:18.317 --> 15:19.921
It wasn't like that.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.828
It was a mutually satisfying hookup.

15:25.491 --> 15:29.803
So, if Sophie didn't turn to you,
her secret vampire lover,

15:29.962 --> 15:33.569
in her hour of need,
what did she do?

15:33.666 --> 15:35.646
She did what any good girl would do.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.473
She went to her priest.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.618
WOMAN: <i>You've never cared
about witch business, Sophie,</i>

15:41.774 --> 15:44.948
and now you have the gall to reveal
our private dealings to an outsider.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.522
You have to find another way.

15:46.679 --> 15:47.987
You think we do this lightly?

15:48.147 --> 15:50.320
The vampire presence in the
Quarter is growing stronger.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.430
We need more power to fight them off.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.326
Harsh times call for harsh measures.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.990
This is a little more
than harsh, Bastianna.

15:57.156 --> 15:59.295
You don't understand
because you don't believe.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.036
You've never believed.

16:01.194 --> 16:04.539
But I believe enough to put
everything on the line for this.

16:04.697 --> 16:08.201
And being chosen for the offering,
it's an honor.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.506
It's a myth, Jane-Anne.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.446
What you are planning
to do is not only wrong,

16:13.606 --> 16:15.483
in my city, it's illegal.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.621
In your city full of vampires?

16:17.777 --> 16:20.621
The vampires and the human faction
have an arrangement,

16:20.780 --> 16:22.851
just like we have with you all.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.052
Protect the locals,
protect our homes,

16:25.218 --> 16:26.720
we look the other way.

16:26.886 --> 16:29.560
What you are planning goes too far.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.464
We are simply taking what we need.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.572
Our connection to our
ancestors weakens over time.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.470
You sow, and you reap.
That's the way the Harvest works.

16:38.631 --> 16:43.011
I am the only ally you witches
have in this town.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.378
Do you really wanna face
Marcel without me?

16:46.539 --> 16:48.348
Because that is what
you'll be dealing with

16:48.508 --> 16:50.044
if you go through with the Harvest.

16:50.209 --> 16:52.052
Everything okay in here, Uncle Kieran?

16:52.879 --> 16:54.483
We were just finishing, Sean.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.891
Right?

16:57.917 --> 16:59.760
I believe I've made myself clear.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.024
We'll take this matter to the elders.

17:07.326 --> 17:08.828
Continue to study, Sean.

17:08.994 --> 17:11.669
Your uncle is an excellent role model.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.435
(SPEAKING SOFTLY IN
FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

17:17.603 --> 17:19.583
MARCEL: <i>The witches
were furious with Kieran.</i>

17:19.739 --> 17:23.117
Sophie tells me that the witches
put a hex on his nephew, Sean.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.278
Made it seem like
he was slowly losing his mind,

17:25.444 --> 17:29.017
in order to distract Kieran
while they kept planning for the Harvest.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.956
So they attacked Kieran's nephew.

17:33.119 --> 17:34.462
Yeah.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.726
Kid wasn't the same after that.
Ended up going postal,

17:37.890 --> 17:39.699
killing all his
fellow seminary students,

17:39.792 --> 17:43.069
all of them, and then himself.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.106
I might have read about that.

17:46.065 --> 17:51.378
The boy killed a twin,
or he was a twin or something.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.813
Oh, no, no.
They said that he had a twin sister.

18:03.449 --> 18:04.655
So, enlighten me.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.990
What did you mean
when you said you had to die?

18:07.153 --> 18:09.759
That's what the Harvest was.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.995
They said they'd put us
four girls in a state of, like,

18:12.158 --> 18:14.229
peaceful limbo as part
of the offering,

18:14.393 --> 18:17.931
and then later at the Reaping,
we'd awaken and be reborn.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.635
I never got as far as the limbo part,

18:20.766 --> 18:22.905
which means the Harvest
isn't complete.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.779
That's why the witches
are so freaked out.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.647
The Reaping is just around the corner,

18:27.740 --> 18:30.243
and if they don't finish it before then,
it's over.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.684
All I have to do is wait it out.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.189
And then what?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.521
They're punished, and I'm free.

18:39.785 --> 18:40.957
From Marcel?

18:41.854 --> 18:43.197
Of magic.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.600
All our power will drain away.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.469
I'll be normal.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.476
And is that what you want,
to be normal?

18:55.368 --> 18:57.848
I just don't wanna be what I am.

18:59.872 --> 19:04.343
I can't control it sometimes,
the magic.

19:06.545 --> 19:11.460
I hurt people,
even when I don't mean to.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.387
Why don't you tell me
about your friends?

19:16.889 --> 19:18.391
You must miss them.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.703
There's Tim.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.671
<i>He doesn't know about any
of this witch stuff. He's normal.</i>

19:25.531 --> 19:28.068
My best friend, Monique.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.348
She was a part of the Harvest too.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.715
She's lucky.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.154
No one ever fought for me,
but someone fought for her.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.759
The only one who ever spoke out
against the Harvest

19:44.850 --> 19:46.887
was Monique's aunt.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.555
And who is that?

19:50.756 --> 19:52.201
Sophie Deveraux.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.077
So this Harvest thingy, tell me more.

20:07.239 --> 20:08.445
Klaus said to wait.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.587
Yes. He also said to
stay out of the bayou,

you and Hayley went to the Bayou,

think may be Marcel's informant,

and then you lost him.

21:02.128 --> 21:05.234
Yes, and now that we've established
that I am a failure as a sister

21:05.397 --> 21:07.968

So, neither did I.

We thought it was such an honor.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.704
We had such faith.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.348
We were so stupid.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.809

in the knife they used to cut our palms

22:44.997 --> 22:46.533
we would all be resurrected.

They said we'd awaken and all be
together and more powerful than ever.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.746
And it was just like we rehearsed it.

26:46.071 --> 26:49.518
But mostly, I just didn't wanna die.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.952
So, I let him save me.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.012
Marcel saved my life.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.699
You're quite the
knight in shining armor,

27:05.858 --> 27:10.466
though Davina must realize
you owe her as much as she owes you.

27:10.529 --> 27:13.703
You never could have banned the
witches from using magic without her.

27:13.765 --> 27:17.645
She's not exactly besties with them.
I'm protecting her.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.714
A lot of them would like
to get their hands on her

27:19.872 --> 27:21.442
and kill her to finish the Harvest.

27:21.507 --> 27:24.784
If they don't, the other girls stay dead,
and they lose their power.

27:24.943 --> 27:26.684
And if they do, you lose yours.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.950
And Davina loses her life.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.889
Isn't this like old times?

27:31.717 --> 27:33.628
Just how drunk are you two?

27:33.785 --> 27:35.787
Skating on the razor's edge.

27:36.955 --> 27:39.060
I'm gonna use the loo.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.034
Back in a tick.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.233
I haven't seen him this
lushy since the twenties.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.071
So you came to take him home?

27:50.235 --> 27:51.475
Why else would I be here?

27:51.637 --> 27:52.809
I don't know.

27:52.971 --> 27:56.509
Maybe to make sure I didn't get too drunk
and spill secrets

27:56.575 --> 27:58.555
better left unspilled
about you and me.

28:02.247 --> 28:03.817
I know better.

28:04.583 --> 28:05.926
I hope so.

28:06.084 --> 28:08.928
Because you don't wanna
to end up on the wrong side of me.

28:09.087 --> 28:15.732
Rebekah Mikaelson, you do not
wanna be on the wrong side of me.

28:24.269 --> 28:25.839
Tomas, I presume.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.614
Marcel asked me to find out what
you know about the dead witches.

28:29.775 --> 28:32.949
I heard they were going
after some pregnant werewolf.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.284
I mean, she was stupid
being out there all alone.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.120
Yeah. She was. Yeah. She is.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.228
It's amazing how gullible
some people can be.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.863
Yeah.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.707
You may return this now
to its rightful owner.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.367
It's restored.

29:00.939 --> 29:03.442
(VIOLIN PLAYS SOFTLY)

29:04.309 --> 29:06.255
I don't even know if I'll see him again.

29:06.878 --> 29:09.119
(DEEP RUMBLING)

29:21.827 --> 29:26.071
Davina, this power that you contain
drawn from your fallen friends,

29:26.231 --> 29:27.938
it's too much for you.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.570
You need control which
requires study and practice.

29:33.639 --> 29:36.950
And my mother was
a very powerful witch.

29:37.075 --> 29:40.318
She left behind her <i>grimoires,</i>
a legacy of books filled with spells.

29:40.445 --> 29:43.756
These books contain all of the tools
that you might need

29:43.915 --> 29:45.485
to control your magic.

29:47.419 --> 29:51.765
If you free me from here,
I can share them with you.

29:53.692 --> 29:55.330
However, if you leave now
with Marcel,

29:55.494 --> 29:57.974
we'll never see each other again,

29:58.096 --> 30:01.305
and I cannot find you,
and I can't help you.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.616
The witches manipulated me.

30:06.705 --> 30:08.013
You know how that ended.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.643
This is not manipulation.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.150
This is one thing
in exchange for another.

30:16.848 --> 30:19.328
I'm offering you a deal.

30:30.228 --> 30:32.230
That was fast work, Rebekah.

30:32.397 --> 30:35.071
Where's Marcel?
In there touching up his lipstick?

30:35.233 --> 30:36.576
Credit me with some taste.

30:36.735 --> 30:38.476
It's filthy in there.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.139
Where'd he go?

30:40.238 --> 30:42.741
He didn't tell you he was leaving?

30:44.009 --> 30:45.852
No.

30:45.911 --> 30:47.857
Do you think he
realized we were stalling him?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.253
No.

30:52.217 --> 30:55.357
Unless he was stalling us.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.091
Okay.
Now's our shot.

31:00.258 --> 31:01.760
You ready to blow this joint?

31:01.927 --> 31:03.838
- Can't wait.
- All right.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.735
We'll leave Elijah
behind as a parting gift.

31:08.900 --> 31:12.177
Might buy me a little forgiveness
for pulling one over on his siblings.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.115
Let's go.

31:32.624 --> 31:33.864
What's wrong?

31:33.959 --> 31:35.404
(LOW RUMBLING)

31:35.627 --> 31:36.901
What's happening?

31:37.062 --> 31:39.099
I don't know.
(PANTING)

31:39.197 --> 31:40.904
Somethings wrong.
(SCREAMS)

31:41.066 --> 31:42.875
(LOUD RUMBLING)

31:47.406 --> 31:50.580
Marcel, there's something
dangerous out there.

31:52.377 --> 31:53.447
Take me back.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.925
Damn it.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.809
No one's gonna look for you here.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.374
It's only for a little while
'til I can get you out of town

32:51.536 --> 32:53.675
and someplace safe.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.654
For now, I can get
you whatever you want.

32:57.776 --> 32:58.811
What do you like to do?

33:01.446 --> 33:02.447
Draw.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.560
An artist, huh?
That's cool.

33:04.716 --> 33:05.888
Okay-

33:06.051 --> 33:07.724
I can buy out Vincent's
for you tomorrow,

33:07.886 --> 33:09.456
maybe get you some curtains or--

33:09.621 --> 33:11.225
Marcel.

33:12.891 --> 33:15.337
You know what I really want?

33:18.129 --> 33:20.075
I wanna make them pay.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.086
Elijah?

33:36.748 --> 33:38.591
I'm pleased you stayed.

33:39.384 --> 33:41.762
You'll keep your promise
about your mother's spell book?

33:41.920 --> 33:43.194
I will.

33:46.091 --> 33:49.334
You know, difficulties aside,
I value my family above everything.

33:50.929 --> 33:53.569
I am sorry that yours failed you.

33:55.066 --> 33:57.706
Your brother Klaus handed
you to Marcel in a box,

33:57.869 --> 33:59.405
yet you still don't give up on him.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.411
Well, I've given up on giving up.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.215
It's an affliction.

34:09.214 --> 34:11.888
I will fight for my family
until my last breath.

34:12.918 --> 34:15.194
And I'll fight the witches until mine.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.563
Now what?

34:21.726 --> 34:24.070
You're just gonna leave her
up there for anybody to find?

34:24.228 --> 34:25.764
I'm not in the mood, Kieran.

34:25.931 --> 34:28.605
You were supposed to get her out
of New Orleans after the Harvest.

34:28.699 --> 34:31.203
We failed those other three girls.
We didn't fail her.

34:31.369 --> 34:33.975
That is why I came to you for help.
That was the plan.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.482
Plans change.

34:35.639 --> 34:38.313
Especially after you found
out how powerful she was.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.650
Let's get something straight.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.987
For eight months since you left,
I've been running this town just fine.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.596
I don't need you coming back
and getting in my business.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.732
I will do what I want where I want.

34:49.888 --> 34:50.922
Got it?

34:51.456 --> 34:53.129
You wanna be the boss?

34:53.291 --> 34:55.168
You wanna call the shots?

34:55.327 --> 34:59.139
Fine, but I call the shots
with the humans.

35:04.970 --> 35:07.007
And you don't wanna
make an enemy of me.

35:08.006 --> 35:12.512
So, I would suggest one thing,
stay away from my niece.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.092
Fine.
Who the hell's your niece?

35:16.181 --> 35:17.922
Cami.

35:36.868 --> 35:40.042
Those people, all this because
of a vision about my baby

35:40.205 --> 35:42.207
you don't think is true.

35:42.374 --> 35:46.015
Look, I love Sabine,

35:46.177 --> 35:48.521
but she's the witch equivalent
of a drama queen.

35:48.613 --> 35:52.857
I've learned to take little stock
in whatever she says or sees.

35:53.018 --> 35:55.396
Just kind of wish
she'd kept her mouth shut.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.863
The Harvest ritual.

35:58.023 --> 35:59.900
You said you didn't believe in it.

36:01.359 --> 36:02.804
Were you right?

36:02.894 --> 36:04.805
No.

36:04.863 --> 36:08.310
I saw it with my own eyes.
It was working.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.741
It was real.

36:13.505 --> 36:17.078
So how can you be so sure
Sabine's vision isn't?

36:32.023 --> 36:34.594
KLAUS: Taking me on a field trip
to distract me?

36:34.759 --> 36:37.603
Pathetic and obvious.
I taught you better than that.

36:37.762 --> 36:40.265
You taught me to protect what's mine.

36:40.432 --> 36:43.413
You will not take Davina from me.
End of story.

36:43.568 --> 36:45.206
An immutable law of nature, Marcel,

36:45.370 --> 36:47.350
is the strong always
take from the weak.

36:47.505 --> 36:50.281
If you were so strong, you wouldn't
have run away from New Orleans

36:50.442 --> 36:53.616
like a little bitch
all those years ago.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.950
(GRUNTING)

36:56.347 --> 36:59.624
You've been playing king with
a bunch of children for too long.

36:59.784 --> 37:02.958
Don't mistake me for one of your
Nightwalker lackies, Marcel.

37:03.121 --> 37:05.294
I can take Davina any time I like.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.934
What the...?

37:12.097 --> 37:14.134
Do forgive me, Marcel.

37:14.299 --> 37:19.078
But if anyone is to teach
my brother a lesson, it's me.

37:27.145 --> 37:28.920
I don't care if we
have to get you a leash.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.889
That was your last trip to the bayou.

37:31.049 --> 37:33.393
What is it with you and
those wolves, anyway?

37:33.551 --> 37:36.122
I feel like we're connected somehow.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.435
I don't know.

37:39.591 --> 37:43.505
Maybe it's just some pipe dream
that I have of finding any real family

37:43.661 --> 37:48.269
out there, but sometimes when
I feel like it's me against the world,

37:48.433 --> 37:50.071
keeps me going.

37:52.303 --> 37:53.941
Oh, right.

37:56.141 --> 38:00.112
Well, if you ask me,
family is a pain in the behind.

38:00.245 --> 38:04.284
And as for being in it alone,
how dare you?

38:05.183 --> 38:07.789
I don't ruin a perfectly
fabulous pair of boots

38:07.952 --> 38:09.989
traipsing through the Bayou
for just anyone.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.040
Nik. Finally. What...?

38:27.005 --> 38:28.643
Elijah.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.022
You're safe.

38:39.217 --> 38:42.562
Now that you're home,
is your first plan to kill Niklaus?

38:42.720 --> 38:45.496
Excuse me, just a moment.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.973
Where's he going?

39:14.652 --> 39:17.030
You're back.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.897
I'm back.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.113
Don't make promises you can't keep.

39:37.442 --> 39:39.251
Welcome home.

39:45.450 --> 39:48.021
ELIJAH: Everything that brought
us here to New Orleans was a lie.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.759
This story that
Sophie Deveraux fabricated,

39:50.922 --> 39:53.766
this struggle for
control of the French Quarter,

39:53.925 --> 39:55.962
this war between
vampires and witches,

39:56.127 --> 39:58.971
wasn't over territory at all.
This was over Davina.

39:59.130 --> 40:03.636
I swear I had no idea that the
Harvest could possibly be real.

40:03.801 --> 40:07.146
But the one thing that you were sure of
is that I was wrong and that

40:07.305 --> 40:12.152
I would risk Monique's life on a
maybe, and now my daughter is dead.

40:14.812 --> 40:17.053
Please tell me how to fix this.

40:17.949 --> 40:21.556
Now that Marcel has Davina,
how are we even supposed to find her?

40:21.719 --> 40:23.289
If we don't finish the Harvest,

40:23.454 --> 40:27.129
Monique and those two other girls
are dead for real.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.172
Look at me.

40:33.331 --> 40:36.835
You and I are gonna find
a way to get Monique back.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.013
It'll be our little secret.

40:40.171 --> 40:41.343
We'll do it together.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.613
We'll seal off the cemetery
from the vampires,

40:44.776 --> 40:48.849
find Davina, stop Marcel, and finish
the ritual once and for all.

40:50.415 --> 40:53.191
Even if I have to slit
Davina's throat myself.

40:57.855 --> 41:02.770
Eight months ago, Sophie Deveraux and
her sister Jane-Anne lost everything.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.441
Now, four months after that,
a young, pregnant girl

41:06.597 --> 41:08.042
wanders into their restaurant.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.372
Suddenly, all hope is renewed.

41:10.535 --> 41:13.209
Jane-Anne actually sacrificed
her life so that her sister

41:13.371 --> 41:15.874
could use you to find Davina.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.953
If Sophie Deveraux is
successful in capturing Davina,

41:19.043 --> 41:22.183
she can return
Jane-Anne's daughter back to life.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.886
We thought we'd come here
to wage a war for power.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.495
This is about family.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.656
In order to return her niece to life,

41:31.823 --> 41:33.734
Sophie Deveraux will fight
to the death.

41:35.693 --> 41:37.798
That makes her more
dangerous than anyone.
