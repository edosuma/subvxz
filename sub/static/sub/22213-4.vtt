00:01.102 --> 00:02.903
-Previously on Chance...
-HYNES: Hey.

00:03.003 --> 00:05.073
Woman found with her throat cut,
a kid shot in the head

00:05.173 --> 00:08.509
breaking into a car
registered to Ryan Winter.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.412
I'm gonna need you to get into
Ryan Winter's head for me.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.216
You were attacked by a stranger,
targeted for whatever reason.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.885
Rear choke like that
for longer than 40 seconds,

00:17.985 --> 00:19.720
and you wouldn't be here.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.589
Winter is here
in my office.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.790
Change rattles him.

00:22.890 --> 00:23.891
If I keep him here,

00:23.991 --> 00:25.459
can you get into his house?

00:25.559 --> 00:27.461
Already out the door, Doc.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.029
You spread that shit around
about me and John.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.364
-Chill out.
-And then just sit here.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.732
You are not my friend!

00:31.832 --> 00:33.467
Whatever, stalker freak.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.469
WINTER:
Someone's broken into my house

00:35.569 --> 00:37.071
and taken things, moved things.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.273
What they stole has no value
other than to me.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.643
-Did you call the police?
-He is the police.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.778
Detective Kevin Hynes.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.114
It really freaked him out,
what you did.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.616
Look, I don't give a shit,
but I can't lose this job.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.918
In case you get hungry.
Why didn't you scream

00:51.018 --> 00:53.053
when you saw me in the house?
'Cause you're not scary.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.623
When I was 8, I was standing
on a train platform.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.958
This woman had come out
of the crowd, grabbed him,

00:58.058 --> 01:00.094
and tossed him
in front of the train.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.496
I found a way to cope.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.065
There's this asshole
bullied me or whatever.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.067
D: Anytime somebody bullies you,
you should thank them every day.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.403
Learn to stand up
for yourself now.

01:09.503 --> 01:10.571
Anything can be a weapon.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.406
-Oh.
-Oh!

01:12.506 --> 01:14.108
-Thank you.
-Hey, take a bow.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.677
For what?
Your good work
made this happen.

01:16.777 --> 01:20.181
Ryan Winter just donated
$1 million to the unit

01:20.281 --> 01:21.682
in Josefa's name.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.987

01:27.087 --> 01:30.958

01:31.058 --> 01:33.127

01:33.227 --> 01:36.130
**

01:36.230 --> 01:39.967
**

01:40.067 --> 01:45.673
**

01:45.773 --> 01:50.844
**

01:50.944 --> 01:54.448
**

01:54.548 --> 01:57.050
(streetcar bell dings)

01:57.151 --> 02:02.623

02:02.723 --> 02:06.694

02:09.062 --> 02:10.531
(indistinct conversation)

02:10.631 --> 02:13.167

over P.A.)

02:13.267 --> 02:16.404
**

02:16.504 --> 02:20.508
**

02:20.608 --> 02:22.410
Pinch me, right?

02:22.510 --> 02:24.044
This is too good
to be true.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.913
CHANCE: I agree.

02:26.013 --> 02:28.182
**

02:28.282 --> 02:31.084
What?

02:31.185 --> 02:34.087
Come on.

02:34.188 --> 02:40.394
**

02:40.494 --> 02:42.763
I don't think you should
take this money.

02:42.863 --> 02:43.997
**

02:44.097 --> 02:47.601
What do you mean, don't?
Based on what?

02:47.701 --> 02:49.069
Well, he's a patient with
head trauma for one thing.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.404
We've accepted money
from victims

02:50.504 --> 02:52.039
and families of victims
before.

02:52.139 --> 02:55.509
I mean, not this much money,
but they donate all the time.

02:55.609 --> 02:56.777
It's not unethical.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.446
It's what helps
keep our doors open.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.681
Will you -- Will you just
listen to me for a second?

03:00.781 --> 03:02.383
I'm just concerned
that this donation

03:02.483 --> 03:03.451
is gonna come
with strings.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.219
Access.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.721
This is not the type of guy
who can give a million dollars

03:07.821 --> 03:09.056
-and just leave it at that.
-Fine.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.592
He can have
my parking spot.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.126
I'm serious.

03:13.227 --> 03:16.129
So am I.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.731
Do I really have to tell you
what a million dollars

03:17.831 --> 03:18.866
means for this unit?

03:18.966 --> 03:19.900
I know, I know.
I just --

03:20.000 --> 03:21.034
(cellphone chiming)

03:21.134 --> 03:22.436
I just don't want him

03:22.536 --> 03:24.972
to distract from the people
who actually need us.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.807
(chiming stops)
Yeah?

03:26.907 --> 03:28.476
**

03:28.576 --> 03:32.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
C-Christina, s-slow down.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.381
**

03:33.481 --> 03:34.548
Is she with you now?

03:34.648 --> 03:35.649
Okay.

03:35.749 --> 03:39.453
Uh, I'll meet you
at my place in 20 minutes.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.088
-Nicole?
-Yeah.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.222
I got to go.
(door opens)

03:42.323 --> 03:43.291
I'll call you later.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.558
Hey. This money,

03:44.658 --> 03:46.427
it'll be a good thing.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.397
(indistinct conversations)

03:49.497 --> 03:51.899
**

03:51.999 --> 03:54.101

WOMAN: Jesus,
carryout check stand 2.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.746
Jesus,
carryout check stand 2.

04:05.846 --> 04:06.914
**

04:07.014 --> 04:10.651
Folic acid and iron
and a stool softener

04:10.751 --> 04:12.185
for the iron
side effects.

04:12.286 --> 04:15.523
**

04:15.623 --> 04:17.525
You know they have
flowers here.

04:17.625 --> 04:21.094
Folic acid helps protect
your baby against birth defects,

04:21.194 --> 04:23.163
and the iron
prevents anemia.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.998
**

04:25.098 --> 04:27.267
What's your name?

04:27.368 --> 04:28.302
D.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.137
D.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.473
I have a doctor, D.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.275
An O.B. for the baby.

04:35.376 --> 04:40.648
She tells me not to eat raw fish
and weird cheeses or whatever.

04:40.748 --> 04:45.018
And she tells me to take
vitamins, so I do that.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.456
But thank you.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.558
Okay, then.

04:50.658 --> 04:51.692
**

04:51.792 --> 04:55.128
So, you're stalking me
at the supermarket

04:55.228 --> 04:57.164
because of birth defects?

04:57.264 --> 04:58.466
Hmm?

04:58.566 --> 05:00.200
Then why?

05:00.300 --> 05:03.871
Y-Your boss,
he's a very bad man.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.474
That's all I know
is bad men.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.709
You're gonna have to say
more than that.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.911
He kills people.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.080
What people?
Women, mostly.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.915
**

05:15.015 --> 05:16.517
So, he's gonna kill me?

05:16.617 --> 05:17.851
Doubt it.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.387
That'd be too obvious,

05:19.487 --> 05:21.221
although I guess
you never know.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.523
**

05:22.623 --> 05:24.858
You a cop?
No.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.394
Good.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.261
You ever kill anybody?

05:28.362 --> 05:30.263
Nobody anyone would miss.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.900
**

05:33.000 --> 05:34.902
So, what do you want
from me, anyway?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.270
I just figured
you should know.

05:37.371 --> 05:41.542
Yeah, that's an answer,
but it's not the whole answer.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.545
You like Chinese food?

05:44.645 --> 05:45.779
Sure.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.048
Golden Pagoda,
tomorrow at 2:00.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.683
You can take me to lunch.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.920
The baby likes the chicken
in black bean sauce.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.055
Okay.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.957
Good.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.259
WOMAN: Price check in produce.
Price check in produce.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.728
Cashier 2.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.096
You can tell me the rest
of the answer then.

06:03.196 --> 06:07.935
**

06:08.035 --> 06:10.571
**

06:10.671 --> 06:13.941
CHANCE:
Nic thanked Pepper?

06:14.041 --> 06:17.044
Right after she
broke her nose.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.912
And that Pepper
is a piece of work,

06:19.012 --> 06:20.448
just pretending
to be her friend

06:20.548 --> 06:24.051
so she could
humiliate her?

06:25.619 --> 06:26.887
So, what now?

06:26.987 --> 06:30.090
Expulsion, possibly.
I don't know.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.992
I'll know more when I talk
to the dean tomorrow.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.260
What time?

06:33.360 --> 06:36.430
I'll come with you.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.831
There's another shoe.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.400
Of course there is.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.472
Her parents are
pressing charges,

06:44.572 --> 06:46.907
aggravated assault.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.009
Aggravated?

06:49.109 --> 06:52.079
They're saying the book was
a weapon, a blunt instrument.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.649
The hospital's holding her
overnight for observation.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.418
That's standard
concussion protocol.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.789
Okay, well, I guess
I'll go talk to the parents.

07:01.889 --> 07:02.990
And then I'll handle
the dean?

07:05.459 --> 07:10.430
Eldon, uh, she's going to be
charged with a felony.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.667
Is there a scenario
where she goes to jail

07:13.767 --> 07:17.137
or some kind of, like,
juvenile detention center?

07:17.237 --> 07:18.472
No.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.107
That's not gonna happen.

07:20.207 --> 07:23.343
I really thought that
we were over this. I --

07:23.443 --> 07:24.612
She was doing so well.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.482
I'll go talk to her.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.520
Do you ever think that
maybe this is our fault?

07:32.620 --> 07:36.990
I mean, she's so bright and --
and beautiful and young

07:37.090 --> 07:39.660
and unjaded and unspoiled.

07:39.760 --> 07:44.031
I don't know where
this is coming from.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.502
I mean, the stalking
last year, and now?

07:48.602 --> 07:50.904
I-I keep thinking that

07:51.004 --> 07:52.573
the only
common denominator is --

07:52.673 --> 07:53.674
is us.

07:54.842 --> 07:58.011
You had nothing
to do with this.

07:58.111 --> 08:04.184
**

08:04.284 --> 08:08.388
(door closes)

08:13.493 --> 08:16.530
Pepper humiliated me
in front of basically everyone,

08:16.630 --> 08:19.533
so forget putting anything
behind me or starting over.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.368
Not to mention
ruining any chance

08:21.468 --> 08:24.371
I had at making any
other friends besides her.

08:24.471 --> 08:28.676
And the rest, as they say,
is history.

08:33.013 --> 08:39.386
Look, I -- I understand
the impulse, I do.

08:39.486 --> 08:42.522
I just --

08:42.623 --> 08:46.760
You ever feel like your life
is just some ride?

08:46.894 --> 08:49.262
You're at a carnival,
you strap yourself in,

08:49.362 --> 08:52.365
and then somebody else decides
how fast or high you go?

08:52.465 --> 08:55.035
**

08:55.135 --> 08:57.104
But you do have control.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.973
It might not always
feel like that, but...

09:00.073 --> 09:03.210
Yeah, but even before this.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.478
Too many times I'd get up
in the morning and think,

09:05.579 --> 09:08.415
(scoffs)
"Here we go again."

09:08.515 --> 09:11.118
Walking the school halls,
worried,

09:11.218 --> 09:13.253
wondering what's next,

09:13.353 --> 09:17.157
what's out there
waiting for me now?

09:17.257 --> 09:18.792
But today with Pepper?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.829
I was what was waiting.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.397
And to be honest,
it felt awesome.

09:24.497 --> 09:29.770
**

09:29.870 --> 09:34.808
Look, after what Pepper did,
you had every right to be upset.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.943
This is not the way
to deal with it.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.477
Really?

09:37.577 --> 09:42.082
You tried "walking and reading"
at the same time lately?

09:42.182 --> 09:43.817
Look, do me a favor.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.753
In the future,
will you talk to me first?

09:45.853 --> 09:47.120
Well, I tried,

09:47.220 --> 09:49.757
and I could not
find you anywhere,

09:49.857 --> 09:50.958
so I talked to D.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.259
D?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.827
Yeah, he thinks
we should thank bullies.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.964
What? We should --
Thank them for what?

09:57.064 --> 09:58.531
Well,
he says everyone else

09:58.632 --> 10:02.369
just wants to keep us
weak and calm,

10:02.469 --> 10:03.804
but bullies challenge us,

10:03.904 --> 10:05.973
show us how
to handle adversity

10:06.073 --> 10:08.208
and give us insight
into who we really are.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.043
Mm-hmm.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.945
So this is
who you really are now?

10:12.045 --> 10:16.616
Mm. I don't know.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.687
I just know that
whoever I was today,

10:19.787 --> 10:21.955
I like her way more
than who I've been.

10:22.055 --> 10:28.161

10:44.111 --> 10:47.580
(conversations continues)

10:47.681 --> 10:50.583
This is not smart,
you being here.

10:50.684 --> 10:51.752
You got no way of knowing

10:51.885 --> 10:53.320
whether you're gonna
run into him.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.521
I wouldn't
have had to come

10:54.621 --> 10:56.690
if you'd answer
your fucking cell.

10:56.790 --> 11:00.227
Besides, you said you were gonna
keep him from coming in here.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.095
He noticed
and wrote a check so big,

11:02.195 --> 11:03.764
no one cares what I think.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.934
(telephone ringing
in distance)

11:07.034 --> 11:09.436
WOMAN:
Diagnostics, please dial 7-1.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.571
Diagnostics, dial 7-1.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.106
(conversations continue)

11:13.206 --> 11:18.545
So, his story about a kid
being throw on the train tracks?

11:18.645 --> 11:21.281
The woman's name
is Amy Debbs.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.383
Has a history
of mental illness,

11:23.483 --> 11:27.087
in and out of psych wards
until July of '82,

11:27.187 --> 11:29.289
where she tossed this kid
on the tracks

11:29.389 --> 11:32.225
at the Emeryville
train station.

11:32.325 --> 11:36.229
So that really happened.
Winter was telling the truth.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.698
Yep.
And there's more.

11:38.799 --> 11:42.469
The kid (groans) with
the grace of fucking God

11:42.569 --> 11:46.606
ends up under the train or
beside the train and survives.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.275
And Debbs was
arrested on the scene

11:48.375 --> 11:50.610
and brought straight in
to be processed.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.946
But no one ever
claims the kid.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.316
In 1982, Winter would
have been 6 or 7.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.551
Yeah, I could never get
anything on Winter's childhood.

11:58.651 --> 11:59.787
I mean,
the things I did get,

11:59.887 --> 12:03.924
I couldn't be sure it wasn't
some revisionist history

12:04.024 --> 12:08.796
done after he shot into
rich people stratosphere.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.431
And I don't even know
where he was originally from

12:11.531 --> 12:13.566
or if Winter
was even his name.

12:13.666 --> 12:17.404
Where is Amy Debbs now?

12:17.504 --> 12:18.738
Do we know
if she's still alive?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.440
Patton State Hospital.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.475
(sighs) All right, well,
I know one of the deputy chiefs

12:22.575 --> 12:23.576
of psychiatry down there.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.478
I'll give him a call,

12:25.578 --> 12:27.247
see what kind of cocktail
they've got her on.
(dialing)

12:27.347 --> 12:29.116
If she would talk to me.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.117
About?

12:30.217 --> 12:31.418
(breathes sharply)

12:31.518 --> 12:34.421
About why she tried
to kill her son.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.756
**

12:36.857 --> 12:42.629

WOMAN: Thank you so much.

**

12:58.545 --> 13:00.780
**

13:00.881 --> 13:04.384
The VOVC.
I'm one of the schedulers.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.785
Right.
I thought what you did

13:05.886 --> 13:08.021
was pretty cool.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.457
What I did?

13:10.557 --> 13:12.159
I've done a lot of things.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.393
Oh, right.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.163
The donation --
the ginormous amount of money.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.297
I thought it was
pretty awesome.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.665
Oh, yeah.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.501
Well, thanks.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.403
That was pretty awesome,
wasn't it?

13:23.503 --> 13:26.573
(chuckles)

13:26.673 --> 13:28.241
Have you worked there
a long time?

13:28.341 --> 13:30.710
The unit? Uh, no,
but I used to work with

13:30.810 --> 13:33.013
Dr. Chance when he had
his own practice.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.582
No kidding.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.519
You know, I'm working
with Dr. Chance right now.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.022
Yeah, I know.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.656
You do?
I mean, I don't know-know.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.725
I mean, I know you are.
I do the scheduling.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.896
I don't know anything else,
so don't worry.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.663
(chuckling) Oh, wow.

13:50.763 --> 13:51.899
It literally sounds
like I've never had

13:51.999 --> 13:53.733
an adult
conversation before.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.437
So, how long
have you known him?

13:57.537 --> 14:02.542
A couple of years. Um...
I used to run his practice.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.878
Anyway, I just wanted to say
that what you did was amazing,

14:04.978 --> 14:07.780
and we all
really appreciate it.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.182
What is your name?

14:09.282 --> 14:10.517
Lucy.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.784
Baek.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.054
I'm Ryan Winter,
but you know that.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.855
Mm-hmm.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.892
Not just because of stalky
scheduling weirdness.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.861
Also because
I'm kind of a tech nerd.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.563
Well, those and Star Wars

14:23.663 --> 14:25.298
are my two favorite
kinds of nerds.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.434
(chuckles)

14:27.534 --> 14:30.270
You know, I'm actually
speaking at a thing...

14:30.370 --> 14:32.272
Oh.
...that you might like.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.742
Mm.
It's a conference
on mixed reality.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.711
Oh!
Um, yeah. Uh...

14:40.713 --> 14:42.649
It's just with work and my kid,
it's a little hard

14:42.749 --> 14:43.883
to get away
for last-minute stuff.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.586
You're a mom.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.288
Yeah, the single kind.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.889
**

14:49.990 --> 14:52.559

Well, listen.

**

14:56.863 --> 14:58.665
If you can get away...

14:58.765 --> 15:00.900
Mm-hmm.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.103
(paper tears)

15:03.203 --> 15:06.739
...here's the information.

15:06.839 --> 15:10.510
I -- (scoffs)
It could be interesting, too.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.813
So, bye.
Bye.

a gift shop in there.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.828
(curtain opens)

15:28.928 --> 15:31.131
Hi.

15:31.231 --> 15:36.136
I'm Nicole's father,
Eldon Chance.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.805
I just wanted
to check on Pepper,

15:38.905 --> 15:40.673
tell you
how sorry we all are

15:40.773 --> 15:41.841
that this has happened.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.376
Not as sorry as
you're gonna be, pal.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.613
-It's okay.
-I understand your being upset.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.215
Oh, do you?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.217
Because I didn't see you
sleeping in a plastic chair...

15:50.317 --> 15:52.152
Hey, hey, hey.
...all night while nurses

15:52.252 --> 15:53.820
came in to check your daughter's
pupils every hour.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.323
Bob.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.991
Pepper has
a nasal fracture.

15:58.091 --> 16:02.562
Thankfully, there's no sign
of concussion.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.298
Just spoke with
the attending physician.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.068
What?
You talked to her.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.869
I'm a neuropsychiatrist.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.238
I work with a lot
of head trauma patients.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.472
Yeah, it figures, huh?

16:12.572 --> 16:13.706
it's always the shrink's kids
that are the fucking --

16:13.806 --> 16:15.342
Stop it!

16:15.442 --> 16:16.809
(sighs)

16:16.909 --> 16:19.412
Just take it outside, okay?
Both of you.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.414
Maybe this is not
the best time.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.916
What was
your first clue?

16:24.017 --> 16:26.186
Bob, please.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.487
Once again, I'm so sorry
that this has happened.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.722
And maybe
when you're ready,

16:29.822 --> 16:31.091
we can all sit down and talk
about what to do next.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.160
Your daughter fucking broke
our daughter's nose.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.263
There is nothing for us
to talk about. At all.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.764
Okay?
That's what lawyers are for.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.099
(sighs)

16:39.199 --> 16:40.700
**

16:40.800 --> 16:42.769
Okay, come on. Get your stuff.
Let's get out of here.

WINTER: Lyndsay!

16:52.879 --> 16:54.114
Lyndsay!

16:54.214 --> 16:55.182
Yes?

16:55.282 --> 16:57.016
Where is the briefc--
Right here.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.686
Thank you. Listen,
a talk and a lunch, too,

16:59.786 --> 17:01.721
is too much for me.
I'm not gonna be able to d it.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.456
I'm sorry.
I told them that you probably

17:03.556 --> 17:05.258
wouldn't be staying
to eat.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.893
Did you call them yet?

17:06.993 --> 17:08.061
No.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.529
Do you want me to do it?

17:09.629 --> 17:11.698
No, I will,
but just not right now.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.733
Is the car here?
It's out front.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.236
You know,
trespassing is a crime.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.239
Yeah, I know that.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.276
But what am I
gonna tell 'em?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.044
That Detective Hynes
broke into my house

17:25.145 --> 17:27.414
and rearranged my shirts?

17:27.514 --> 17:29.048
Uh, I wouldn't even
have known he was here

17:29.149 --> 17:31.451
except he stole my rock.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.386
(chuckles)

17:33.486 --> 17:34.787
I would tell me
to fuck off.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.490
Be that as it may --
I hate when people say that.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.260
Why is he doing this?
Why is he doing it again?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.594
It's been four years.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.130
Why is he doing it?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.332
Because he wants
to torment you,

17:45.432 --> 17:47.100
and he is,

17:47.200 --> 17:48.901
and you can't let him
get away with it.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.770
We can't.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.739
We have to deal with it.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.310
Okay, but not right now.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.346
I can't think about this
right now.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.114
And you don't have to.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.449
I'm here for that.

18:02.549 --> 18:03.750
(beep)

18:03.850 --> 18:05.418
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Kitchen door open.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.629
ALVIN: You act like you didn't
start this whole shit here.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.098
Like you didn't just wake up
one day and say,

18:19.199 --> 18:21.268
"Fuck them, this is
how it's gonna be."

18:21.368 --> 18:23.336
Yes,
one day I woke up.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.605
But I never said
fuck you or anyone.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.474
And you know that.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.709
Don't you
put that on me.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.144
I guess you could just
remember it however

18:31.244 --> 18:32.612
you want to remember it, huh?
Huh?

18:32.712 --> 18:35.448
What I want is
for you to tell me

18:35.548 --> 18:36.816
what else I can do
to help you.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.551
Carl still jawing
at that guy in the alley?

18:38.651 --> 18:40.653
-Yeah.
-God damn toyboys.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.522
What the fuck
were you doing,

18:42.622 --> 18:43.690
talking to
Nicole like that?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.525
What the fuck
were you thinking?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.328
Careful, Doc.
Lacquer's wet.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.497
Fuck the lacquer.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.565
She broke a girl's nose.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.501
I didn't tell her
to do that.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.735
Just showed her how.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.570
Yeah, you showed her how,
all right.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.507
How to get
fucking suspended

19:00.607 --> 19:03.009
and probably expelled
from a public school.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.344
How to go to prison
for assault.

19:04.444 --> 19:07.314
She's 16, D. She's a child.
She -- She --

19:07.414 --> 19:08.981
A confident member
of the tribe

19:09.081 --> 19:10.983
who isn't afraid to
stand up for themselves.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.052
Who's ready to
deal on her own

19:13.152 --> 19:14.654
with the reality
of the world.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.023
What are you, a life coach?
Listen to yourself.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.358
This isn't
a half-empty glass.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.327
This fucking glass is full.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.229
If she was my kid,
I'd take her out

19:22.329 --> 19:23.830
for fucking ice cream
and nunchucks.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.266
She's not your kid.
She's mine.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.435
Think of it as
a brush-back pitch.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.670
At the very least,
Nicole showed this

19:30.770 --> 19:31.938
Pepper to herself.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.340
Oh!

19:33.440 --> 19:35.107
Showed her where
that road leads,

19:35.208 --> 19:37.210
and I bet Pepper will give her
a wide berth from now on.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.612
Pepper spent last night
in the hospital.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.080
She's a mess.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.049
Parents are on the warpath,
and I don't blame them.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.418
I do.
She's a piece of shit.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.220
Pretty sure they had
something to do with that.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.589
You don't start worrying
about their child's morality

19:49.689 --> 19:51.291
until she's a teenager?
Oh, Jesus, will --

19:51.391 --> 19:53.059
They're already broken.
Will you stop

19:53.159 --> 19:55.094
talking to me
about parenting?!

19:57.264 --> 20:01.301
It's a good thing, Doc,
Nicole wanting to stand up,

20:01.401 --> 20:04.036
face her struggle
with honor and dignity.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.405
That's badass.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.575
I don't want my daughter
to be badass,

20:08.675 --> 20:11.544
not the way you mean,
not the way you are.

20:11.644 --> 20:16.215
If she ever comes here again
for advice, you better go deaf.

20:16.316 --> 20:19.886
(indistinct conversation
in distance)

20:21.821 --> 20:24.156
You're welcome.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.996
(birds chirping)

20:30.096 --> 20:31.130
(speaking indistinctly)

20:31.230 --> 20:32.432
Yeah.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.471
AMY: He sent me signs.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.841
I didn't recognize them
at first,

20:41.941 --> 20:47.914
but when I did,
they were everywhere.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.081
CHANCE: And what was
the first sign you saw?

20:49.181 --> 20:52.151
Do you remember?

20:52.251 --> 20:54.854
I had the dishes
in the sink.

20:54.954 --> 20:58.024
The TV was on.

20:58.124 --> 21:01.093
And a child had been mauled

21:01.193 --> 21:04.531
by a lion at a zoo
in Milwaukee.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.700
And what did
that tell you?

21:07.800 --> 21:12.104
That He was coming,
and I had to prove myself.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.375
So, what did you do?

21:17.644 --> 21:19.646
I told Matthew.

21:19.746 --> 21:23.115
Told him what?

21:23.215 --> 21:26.185
That the Lord wanted me
to kill him.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.657
How old was he
when you told him that?

21:30.757 --> 21:32.825
3.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.329
His eyes were like stars.

21:36.429 --> 21:41.000
I would look in them and...

21:41.100 --> 21:42.535
I just couldn't.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.407
You couldn't -- You couldn't do
what the Lord was asking?

21:47.507 --> 21:48.541
No.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.378
Did He stop asking?

21:51.478 --> 21:52.845
I thought so.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.046
But then,

21:54.146 --> 21:57.584
I went into Matthew's room
in the morning,

21:57.684 --> 22:00.086
and Matthew rolled
over on his bed,

22:00.186 --> 22:01.654
and he looked at me.

22:01.754 --> 22:06.493
And there was a spider
on his pajamas.

22:06.593 --> 22:08.761
So that night, I did it.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.900
You -- You tried
to kill Matthew.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.503
No.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.405
Myself.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.440
Mm.

22:20.540 --> 22:21.841
**

22:21.941 --> 22:24.343
But it didn't work.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.945
**

22:26.045 --> 22:30.883
The way He wanted me to do it
after that was so much worse.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.252
Because I was fighting it.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.456
He wanted Matthew
s-strangled,

22:36.556 --> 22:39.892
stabbed, cut up

22:39.992 --> 22:44.063
because
I wouldn't listen.

22:45.632 --> 22:46.933
Is that when He told you
about the train?

22:47.033 --> 22:50.202
That's not exactly
what He said.

22:50.302 --> 22:52.805
What did He say?

22:52.905 --> 22:54.941
Metal.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.243
Metal was His message.

22:57.343 --> 22:59.145
**

22:59.245 --> 23:03.315
I couldn't put my hands
on my baby.

23:03.416 --> 23:07.153
Not like God wanted me to,
not like that.

23:07.253 --> 23:11.724
Not cut him and stab him
and beat him to death.

23:11.824 --> 23:15.995
But when I stopped
fighting, I knew.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.931
(metal screeches)

23:19.031 --> 23:20.800
(train rumbling)

23:20.900 --> 23:24.804
I stepped out in faith.

23:24.904 --> 23:29.175
The train would fulfill him.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.744
It would be quick.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.581
It would be enough.

23:34.681 --> 23:37.083
**

23:37.183 --> 23:41.988
**

23:50.162 --> 23:52.599
(sighs)

23:56.969 --> 24:00.006
People thought
I was crazy, too.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.642
I mean,
not Amy Debbs crazy,

24:02.742 --> 24:06.345
but they washed their hands
of me pretty much.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.650
I guess I was glad
when the brass shipped me

24:10.750 --> 24:14.621
to Fremont after I, uh...

24:15.522 --> 24:17.456
I told myself, hey,
that's just what I needed

24:17.557 --> 24:19.792
was a clean slate,
you know?

24:19.892 --> 24:21.360
But that
didn't fucking last.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.663
I mean, Winter for me

24:23.763 --> 24:25.832
is like the princess
and the fucking pea.

24:25.932 --> 24:26.799
No matter what I do,

24:26.899 --> 24:29.869
that piece of shit
keeps me awake.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.341
Why do you think that is?

24:35.441 --> 24:37.376
I mean, to that extent.
Is it Travis?

24:37.476 --> 24:40.647
-'Cause you and he were --
-What?

24:40.747 --> 24:41.881
Us two were what?

24:45.251 --> 24:47.019
Forget it.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.261
You know, we weren't -- if
that's what you were thinking.

24:55.361 --> 24:58.598
It wasn't like that.
I've only been with women.

24:58.698 --> 25:03.035
Almost got married,
even, twice.

25:03.135 --> 25:06.238
I took the road I-I knew,
and once I got going,

25:06.338 --> 25:07.740
I ended up
where it took me.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.042
Till Travis.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.277
You know, and I told myself

25:11.377 --> 25:13.045
it was --
it was just a mentor thing,

25:13.145 --> 25:15.948
a parental, like a --
like a dad and a son.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.618
You know, but inside,

25:18.718 --> 25:21.453
it all just felt
like a load of shit.

25:21.554 --> 25:24.791
Everything felt like shit.

25:24.891 --> 25:28.027
And so, you know,
one day, I just --

25:28.127 --> 25:30.196
I just stopped fighting,
and then I said to myself,

25:30.296 --> 25:32.899
I'm gonna just feel
what I'm feeling.

25:32.999 --> 25:37.804
Secretly to myself.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.906
In case I was wrong.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.474
**

25:42.575 --> 25:44.276
And what happened?

25:44.376 --> 25:46.979
(scoffs)

25:47.079 --> 25:49.582
I guess that's
what happiness is.

25:49.682 --> 25:54.286
Got a glimpse of it.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.889
**

25:56.989 --> 25:58.991
(indistinct conversations)

25:59.091 --> 26:04.731
**

26:04.831 --> 26:07.834
**

26:07.934 --> 26:13.740
**

26:13.840 --> 26:19.245
**

26:19.345 --> 26:20.947
D: Barrio Cazadores.

26:21.047 --> 26:24.617
Your tattoo, the hunters,
Tijuana gang.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.586
You affiliated?

26:27.687 --> 26:29.255
It was another life.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.757
**

26:30.857 --> 26:32.792
Is that where your
baby's daddy is?

26:32.892 --> 26:35.862
You don't take girls out
a whole lot, do you?

26:35.962 --> 26:37.296
No.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.198
**

26:39.298 --> 26:41.300
How'd you become
a murderer's maid?

26:41.400 --> 26:43.803
I was a coyote.

26:43.903 --> 26:47.106
Just outside of Tecate.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.876
I would take people
10, 12, 14 hours, on foot,

26:49.976 --> 26:51.377
through the mountains,
until they were picked up

26:51.477 --> 26:53.179
outside Highway 94.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.314
I'd smuggled so many other
people across the border,

26:55.414 --> 26:57.684
I figured I could go ahead
and smuggle myself over.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.152
And I did.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.721
I stayed with a friend.

27:01.821 --> 27:04.857
She would clean houses
under the table.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.192
And she couldn't make
all of her jobs,

27:06.292 --> 27:08.695
so I started
to fill in for her,

27:08.795 --> 27:14.834
and that's how I met Mr. Ryan's
assistant, Lyndsay.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.035
So, what's it like?

27:16.135 --> 27:19.138
It's pretty boring.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.174
There's cleaning, errands,

27:22.274 --> 27:28.414
and Mr. Ryan has
talked to me maybe twice.

27:28.514 --> 27:29.749
He talks to himself
a lot, though.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.217
What do you mean,
like, he mumbles?

27:31.317 --> 27:35.087
No, more like full-on
conversations.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.889
With who?
Nobody.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.657
There's nobody there.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.894
It's passionate, or he just
yell, or maybe he's crying,

27:41.994 --> 27:43.195
but there's nobody there.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.531
(chuckling)
Mr. Ryan is not all there.

27:45.631 --> 27:48.835
He has his ways.

27:48.935 --> 27:51.570
He hates certain plates,
so a salad plate he hates.
(chuckles)

27:51.670 --> 27:54.073
And he has, you know,
this beautiful swimming pool,

27:54.173 --> 27:55.875
but he never uses
his swimming pool.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.576
Except maybe one time.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.012
One time a man came over,
and he teach him how to swim.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.348
To swim?

28:02.448 --> 28:04.951
LORENA: Mm-hmm, and he's never
been in it since.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.719
(chuckles)

28:06.819 --> 28:07.954
You like pie?

28:09.789 --> 28:10.890
I don't like it.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.358
Oh.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.026
I love it.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.729
**

28:16.829 --> 28:18.030
-Awesome.
-(chuckles)

28:18.130 --> 28:20.199
I'm gonna make
a quick phone call,

28:20.299 --> 28:21.533
and then let's go
get some pie.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.535

over P.A.)

28:31.844 --> 28:32.979
(sighs)

28:33.079 --> 28:34.380
What is this?

28:34.480 --> 28:36.749
Pretty awesome
is what it is.

28:36.849 --> 28:40.219
Ryan Winter replaced the whole
unit's computers for free.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.254
Baller.

28:42.354 --> 28:45.157
When? Why --
Why would he do that?

28:45.257 --> 28:46.658
Apparently,
he heard someone say

28:46.759 --> 28:49.628
something about our computers
being slow and shitty,

28:49.728 --> 28:52.631
and he just, you know,
made the call.

28:52.731 --> 28:56.102
No biggie for him.
Huge deal for us.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.573
I'm excited, too.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.475

CHANCE: Hi.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.223
Listen, I have
to cancel group tonight.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.893
I got a family issue.

29:53.993 --> 29:57.163
Wondered if you wanted to
get together this afternoon.

29:57.263 --> 29:58.630
The two of us?

29:58.730 --> 30:01.968
If that works for you.

30:02.068 --> 30:04.470
I wanted to continue with what
we discussed the other day,

30:04.570 --> 30:06.305
but I don't want
too much time

30:06.405 --> 30:09.175
to -- to lapse
between sessions.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.010
Do you like to walk?

30:11.110 --> 30:14.746
Sure. What did you
have in mind?

30:14.847 --> 30:16.682
Beach.

30:16.782 --> 30:19.351
Dune Point, just north
of the old baths --

30:19.451 --> 30:20.686
you know it?

30:20.786 --> 30:22.721
I know of it.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.257
Great.
So, in about an hour?

30:25.357 --> 30:27.593
(mouse clicking)

30:27.693 --> 30:30.897
Sure, fine.

30:30.997 --> 30:33.599
I hope everything's okay?

30:34.967 --> 30:36.402
What do you mean?

30:36.502 --> 30:38.037
**

30:38.137 --> 30:41.840
With your family, with your
family issue, I hope it's okay.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.709
**

30:43.809 --> 30:45.878
Thank you for saying so.

There's, um --
There's, um, trouble brewing.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.359
I bought a lot of drinks
for a lot of people.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.460
Bring money now.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.461
Where are you?

32:09.561 --> 32:11.130
**

32:11.230 --> 32:13.799
I'm at the Admiral's Arms.

32:13.899 --> 32:17.169
**

32:17.269 --> 32:19.471
Quickly, D.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.140
Coming.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.208
S.O.S. from a friend.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.809
-You game?
-Okay.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.144
(indistinct conversation)

32:25.244 --> 32:28.847
(waves crashing)

32:30.482 --> 32:33.352
WINTER: How do I cope?

32:33.452 --> 32:37.856
You said that after you saw
the boy being thrown

32:37.956 --> 32:40.292
in front of the train,
you found ways to cope.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.161
I just wondered
what they were.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.031
(birds calling)

32:45.131 --> 32:48.534
Back then, it was school.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.803
How about now?

32:51.903 --> 32:54.506
Work.
I run sometimes.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.475
Nothing too unusual.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.744
(birds calling)

32:58.844 --> 33:00.412
For me, it was work,

33:00.512 --> 33:03.082
and then drink
when work wasn't enough.

33:06.052 --> 33:08.054
What are you talking about?

33:08.154 --> 33:11.223
I had a fall.

33:11.323 --> 33:15.394
Actually, in a place
not very different from this.

33:16.662 --> 33:17.996
You fell off a cliff?

33:18.097 --> 33:19.265
Uh-huh.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.167
How?

33:21.267 --> 33:22.834
(birds calling)

33:22.934 --> 33:24.236
One moment I was walking.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.538
Next thing I knew,
I woke up in an ambulance

33:26.638 --> 33:28.607
with my head in a cage.

33:28.707 --> 33:32.578
My PET scan was not
very dissimilar to yours.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.546
Well,
way to bury a lead, Doc.

33:34.646 --> 33:37.083
Yeah, well, protocol is,

33:37.183 --> 33:40.852
we're not supposed to share
personal details with patients.

33:42.188 --> 33:45.124
So, did you feel
different after?

33:45.224 --> 33:48.194
You mean besides
the physical effects?

33:48.294 --> 33:50.296
Double vision,
memory loss?

33:52.598 --> 33:54.766
I find I am more
prone to anger.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.803
And it has been
pointed out to me

33:57.903 --> 34:00.272
that I have
grown reckless.

34:00.372 --> 34:06.545
Okay, okay, but you -- you must
do something to -- to cope.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.147
Not really.

34:09.648 --> 34:10.982
I just embrace.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.118
(wave crashes)

34:12.218 --> 34:15.321
Whoa!

34:16.288 --> 34:19.558
I think
the tide's coming in.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.094
So, I mean, what the fuck
are we supposed to do now?

34:22.194 --> 34:23.795
Wait it out?

34:23.895 --> 34:26.665
Not with this swell.

34:26.765 --> 34:30.136
This whole place is gonna be
under water very soon.

34:30.236 --> 34:31.237
I hope you can swim.

34:31.337 --> 34:32.738
You're kidding me.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.640
(laughs)

34:34.740 --> 34:35.841
That's not funny.

34:35.941 --> 34:36.908
I -- It's --

34:37.008 --> 34:38.244
That water is freezing!

34:38.344 --> 34:39.611
It's 56.

34:39.711 --> 34:44.250
I caught the surf
report driving in.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.984
Just never thought
to actually check and see

34:46.084 --> 34:47.119
what the tide was doing.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.687
It never occurred to me.
Sorry.

34:48.787 --> 34:49.855
But you can swim, right?

34:49.955 --> 34:52.758
Yeah, I can swim,
but I'm not going in there!
Okay.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.526
Come on!

34:54.626 --> 34:56.862
This is just, like,
five minutes. It's...

34:56.962 --> 34:59.198
Go out around the point,
swells from the north,

34:59.298 --> 35:00.832
that'll help, easy.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.834
**

35:02.934 --> 35:04.002
You know,
I told Dr. Clayton

35:04.102 --> 35:07.806
we should have a sign emblazoned
over the door saying,

35:07.906 --> 35:09.675
"Life begins
when things go wrong."

35:09.775 --> 35:12.811
**

35:12.911 --> 35:17.516

35:17.616 --> 35:22.888

35:34.833 --> 35:35.901
(panting)

35:36.001 --> 35:38.304
(gurgling)

35:38.404 --> 35:40.239
(grunts) Eldon!

35:40.339 --> 35:41.873
**

35:41.973 --> 35:43.875
Eldon!

35:43.975 --> 35:46.645

35:46.745 --> 35:49.581
(gasps)

35:49.681 --> 35:50.982

35:56.188 --> 35:59.591

35:59.691 --> 36:02.060

**

36:26.785 --> 36:32.291
**

36:32.391 --> 36:34.726
And who, may I ask,

36:34.826 --> 36:39.765
is this lovely young lady
who came to my rescue?

36:39.865 --> 36:40.766
Lorena.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.903
-Lorena.
-Why this, and why today?

36:45.003 --> 36:48.407
Have something to do with
that new boyfriend of yours?

36:48.507 --> 36:51.277
The guy I saw you
talking to in the alley?

36:51.377 --> 36:52.378
All amped up?

36:52.478 --> 36:53.545
(scoffs)

36:54.980 --> 36:59.117
That was my son,
Alvin.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.419
My son.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.788
The last time I saw him,
he was just a little boy.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.956
What happened?

37:05.056 --> 37:07.225
I'm gay is what happened.

37:07.326 --> 37:10.562
Carl came out,
they cut him off -- his family.

37:10.662 --> 37:13.765
Wanted him out of their lives
and said so.

37:13.865 --> 37:14.766
She's sick and dying,

37:14.866 --> 37:18.304
Olivia, my wife.

37:18.404 --> 37:19.505
Once.

37:19.605 --> 37:22.741
Had insurance from a job,

37:22.841 --> 37:25.344
but the out-of-pocket expenses
crippled them.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.613
That's what the fucking
stolen Mayan shit is about?

37:27.713 --> 37:29.481
They needed my help, D.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.351
**

37:32.451 --> 37:35.954
They're so broke,
it forced them to come to me.

37:36.054 --> 37:38.624
You risked your reputation,
your business.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.659
No more than what you
and I have done together.

37:40.759 --> 37:41.827
(taps)

37:41.927 --> 37:43.495
Yeah, it is.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.996
We may fudge
names and dates,

37:45.096 --> 37:46.532
but the product
is all top drawer.

37:46.632 --> 37:51.337
You start letting in hot shit,
third-party assholes,

37:51.437 --> 37:53.505
risk it all for what?

37:53.605 --> 37:55.641
People who dumped you out
like a dirty ashtray.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.008
He's my son, D.

37:57.108 --> 38:03.315
**

38:03.415 --> 38:06.151
My first son.

38:06.251 --> 38:09.621
**

38:09.721 --> 38:13.859
WINTER: When I left here today,
I had no idea what would --

38:13.959 --> 38:15.494
(birds calling)

38:15.594 --> 38:17.996
I almost didn't come back here.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.998
(sniffles)

38:20.098 --> 38:24.570
I almost died.

38:24.670 --> 38:25.904
You had a limit experience.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.073
That's what
philosophers call it.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.012
It's a near-death experience,

38:34.112 --> 38:37.916
that point of living
that lies as close as possible

38:38.016 --> 38:39.985
to the impossibility of living.

38:41.853 --> 38:43.021
It can give you knowledge
about yourself

38:43.121 --> 38:45.424
that you can't get
any other way.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.926
Whether you like it or not.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.028
Like when you fell
off that cliff.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.096
Yeah.

38:51.196 --> 38:54.666
Going beyond without
actually going beyond.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.735
How'd you feel?

38:56.835 --> 39:00.238
You saved me.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.708
You would have
done the same.

39:02.808 --> 39:07.278
I would like to think so.

39:07.379 --> 39:11.282
But I don't think so.

39:13.685 --> 39:17.689
I've done some things
that I know are bad,

39:17.789 --> 39:21.359
and I don't think I would take
them back, even if I could.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.699
**

39:27.799 --> 39:30.936
How do you feel about
saving my life now?

39:31.036 --> 39:33.138
**

39:33.238 --> 39:36.975
Maybe you should tell me
about those bad things.

39:37.075 --> 39:40.879
Because you can't decide
how you feel unless you know?

39:40.979 --> 39:46.284
**

39:46.384 --> 39:48.787
Fine.

39:48.887 --> 39:52.458
Tell me something
else, then.

39:52.558 --> 39:57.295
Something else that
I've wondered for a long time.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.930
You remember the story
that I told you

39:59.030 --> 40:02.000
about the boy
on the train platform?

40:02.100 --> 40:06.472
If I hadn't seen that,

40:06.572 --> 40:09.741
I mean, if I hadn't had
to explain that to myself,

40:09.841 --> 40:10.976
like you said,

40:11.076 --> 40:15.914
would I be
the person that I am now?

40:16.014 --> 40:17.516
Would I do
the things I do now,

40:17.616 --> 40:20.686
be whatever it is I am,

40:20.786 --> 40:23.789
if I hadn't been there?

40:23.889 --> 40:25.657
**

40:25.757 --> 40:27.793
You want to know
what I think?

40:27.893 --> 40:29.661
(sniffs)

40:29.761 --> 40:33.098
I think it might be
the reason why we met.

40:33.198 --> 40:37.035
I'll tell you what I think when
you tell me the whole story.

40:37.135 --> 40:40.205
**

40:40.305 --> 40:41.707
I don't follow.

40:41.807 --> 40:44.342
The whole story about
why you were there.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.112
Who you were there.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.314
That woman on the platform
was your mother.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.282
The boy was you.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.151
I knew that when you were
telling it to me.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.620
I could hear it
in your voice.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.221
You were testing me
to see if I could

40:56.321 --> 40:59.825
really hear you, and I can.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.993
That's why I saved you.

41:02.093 --> 41:05.463
And that's
the reason we met.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.199
I still need you to trust me,
and you don't.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.835
Until you do,

41:09.935 --> 41:12.403
I don't think
we can keep doing this.

41:12.504 --> 41:13.572
(sighs)

41:13.672 --> 41:15.473
Don't forget to have
someone go to the beach,

41:15.574 --> 41:17.976
pick up your car.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.812
**

41:20.912 --> 41:25.216

41:38.597 --> 41:40.365
LYNDSAY:
I filed it this afternoon.

41:40.465 --> 41:42.033
They promised to
look into it further.

41:42.133 --> 41:45.070
The sergeant seemed
to already know something

41:45.170 --> 41:47.939
about your history
with Detective Hynes.

41:48.039 --> 41:50.241
(sighs)

41:51.509 --> 41:54.212
Why did you do this?

41:54.312 --> 41:55.380
We had to.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.683
No, I said --
I said not right now.

41:57.783 --> 42:00.552
I said I wanted
to think about it.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.387
No.
Ryan.

42:02.487 --> 42:04.455
I'm sorry.

42:04.556 --> 42:05.557
(sighs)

42:05.657 --> 42:08.393
(chuckling) No. No, no.

42:08.493 --> 42:10.528
Oh, God.
But if --

42:10.629 --> 42:14.465
Ryan, if you could see you
the way that I see you.

42:14.566 --> 42:18.970
How upset you are
by all this, how hurt.

42:19.070 --> 42:20.606
I couldn't wait.

42:20.706 --> 42:23.241
I couldn't let him do that
to you again.

42:23.341 --> 42:27.245
You are too good of a man
to have to deal with this.

42:27.345 --> 42:29.447
I had to do something.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.616
No.

42:30.716 --> 42:32.984
Because we're a team.
Aren't we?

42:33.084 --> 42:34.586
Aah!

42:34.686 --> 42:36.487
(grunts)

42:36.588 --> 42:39.825

I'm sorry.

42:59.510 --> 43:00.846
I'm sorry.

43:00.946 --> 43:02.614
You are not her.

43:02.714 --> 43:05.116
You will never be her.

43:05.216 --> 43:06.417
**

43:06.517 --> 43:08.086
Be glad about that.

43:08.186 --> 43:09.487

Uh, I'm sorry.

43:36.782 --> 43:39.317
I should have called ahead,
but I, uh...

43:39.417 --> 43:41.552
I was hoping
maybe we could talk.

43:41.653 --> 43:43.054
(breathes deeply)

43:43.154 --> 43:45.356
Uh, look, my husband's
not here, okay?

43:45.456 --> 43:46.557
He's at a work dinner.

43:46.658 --> 43:49.728
Oh.

43:49.828 --> 43:54.900
Okay, well, I can talk out here
if it's more comfortable.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.902
How's Pepper?

43:57.002 --> 44:00.371
(insects chirping)

44:00.471 --> 44:02.007
She's asleep.

44:02.107 --> 44:05.844
I was just wondering if you
and your husband would be open

44:05.944 --> 44:07.512
to sitting down
with Nicole's mother and me

44:07.612 --> 44:09.480
and just talking
about what happened.

44:10.916 --> 44:11.983
Civilly.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.251
(dog barking in distance)

44:13.351 --> 44:16.321
(scoffs)

44:16.421 --> 44:19.190
No offense, but don't
you think the time for that

44:19.290 --> 44:21.026
would have been the moment
before your daughter

44:21.126 --> 44:22.894
decided to break my --
my daughter's nose?

44:22.994 --> 44:28.333
Pepper humiliated Nicole
in front of the entire school.

44:28.433 --> 44:30.902
For no other reason apparently
than a sadistic enjoyment

44:31.002 --> 44:34.873
of her own power
and moral bankruptcy.

44:34.973 --> 44:37.675
A less charitable person might
call your daughter broken.

44:37.776 --> 44:39.911
Wow, this is what
you call civility, huh?

44:40.011 --> 44:41.679
You know how many kids
kill themselves

44:41.780 --> 44:43.514
over things like this?

44:43.614 --> 44:45.717
I'm sure you could imagine
an alternate landscape

44:45.817 --> 44:47.786
in which Nicole takes
a handful of pills instead.

44:47.886 --> 44:50.455
I don't know why Pepper
did this, okay?

44:50.555 --> 44:52.623
I have no idea.
Maybe it's me, you know.

44:52.724 --> 44:54.425
Maybe I'm -- I'm the reason.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.896
Maybe I'm the broken one.

44:57.996 --> 44:59.364
I don't really care
what I am anyway

44:59.464 --> 45:04.936
because I know that she knows
that I've got her back.

Want to try it?

Thank you.

45:10.475 --> 45:11.709
(laughs)

45:11.810 --> 45:13.578
(indistinct conversations)

45:13.678 --> 45:14.913
What's wrong?

45:15.013 --> 45:16.915
Listen.

45:17.015 --> 45:19.885
There's something I-I want
to talk to you about.

45:19.985 --> 45:22.287
(conversations continue)

45:22.387 --> 45:24.756
It's something I've been
putting off for a long time.

45:24.856 --> 45:26.892
(sighs)

45:26.992 --> 45:28.426
But so much has happened.

45:28.526 --> 45:30.996
It's time
you heard the truth.

45:31.096 --> 45:33.664
About what? You're --
You're kind of scaring me.

45:35.266 --> 45:38.236
The reason --

45:38.336 --> 45:41.106
I think the reason
that, uh...

45:41.206 --> 45:46.912
frightening things
feel good to you,

45:47.012 --> 45:50.115
I think it's because I had
a version of that myself.

45:51.349 --> 45:52.984
What are you talking about?

45:53.084 --> 45:55.320
When I was in my 20s,

45:55.420 --> 45:59.858
I was doing my residency,
and, uh, I met a girl.

45:59.958 --> 46:03.494
And it was, uh --
it was serious.

46:03.594 --> 46:07.465
I thought it was serious.
And she broke it off.

46:07.565 --> 46:11.502
I didn't take it well.
I did not take it well.

46:11.602 --> 46:15.673
And she moved to San Diego,
and I followed.

46:15.773 --> 46:20.011
I followed,
and I followed, and, uh...

46:20.111 --> 46:22.447
She took out
a restraining order.

46:24.983 --> 46:27.285
Which I broke, I violated.

46:29.654 --> 46:32.223
Many times.

46:32.323 --> 46:35.293
So, eventually,
I was arrested.

46:36.561 --> 46:38.063
And I was hospitalized,

46:38.163 --> 46:41.799
and I was on suicide watch
for 28 days.

46:41.900 --> 46:46.404
**

46:46.504 --> 46:49.340
I could just feel
my life unravel.

46:49.440 --> 46:52.643
And I...was powerless
to stop it.

46:52.743 --> 46:56.747
**

46:56.848 --> 46:59.184
And then, when I got out,
I had no money for med school.

46:59.284 --> 47:03.154
I had --
I had nothing left.

47:03.254 --> 47:06.892
**

47:06.992 --> 47:10.561
So, what are we?

47:10.661 --> 47:15.066
I mean, is it some kind
of brain disease?

47:15.166 --> 47:18.769
No, it's, uh...

47:18.870 --> 47:19.938
(breathes sharply)

47:20.038 --> 47:24.943
It's a propensity
to compulsion.

47:25.043 --> 47:28.013
Think of it
as a genetic predisposition.

47:28.113 --> 47:30.081
To being fucked up?

47:31.249 --> 47:33.284
Nic, it's --
Does Mom know?

47:33.384 --> 47:34.285
(sighs)

47:35.320 --> 47:35.553
About what happened,
about everything you said?

47:36.354 --> 47:37.788
No, she does not know
any of this.

47:37.889 --> 47:40.191
Oh, my God.

47:40.291 --> 47:41.759
Here I've been thinking
I'm crazy,

47:41.859 --> 47:43.561
and now you're
telling me I am.

47:43.661 --> 47:44.896
No, you're not.
That's what I'm saying.

47:44.996 --> 47:48.699
You're not crazy.
We are not crazy.

47:48.799 --> 47:49.767
We just --

47:49.867 --> 47:51.202
We just have
to figure out a way

47:51.302 --> 47:54.439
to make this work for us
and not against us.

47:54.539 --> 47:57.108
You have to learn how
to recognize the triggers

47:57.208 --> 47:58.977
and how not to act on them.

47:59.077 --> 48:00.912
Trust me.
Why?

48:01.012 --> 48:03.581
You didn't trust me.

48:03.681 --> 48:05.951
Letting me go this long,
thinking that it was me,

48:06.051 --> 48:07.452
that I was nuts.

48:07.552 --> 48:10.221
Every time you talked to me
about what I did,

48:10.321 --> 48:11.822
you were lying.

48:12.991 --> 48:15.660
Why?

48:15.760 --> 48:19.097

48:19.197 --> 48:21.832
I was reluctant to admit
the possible -- I don't know.

48:21.933 --> 48:23.935
I honestly --
Well, how can you not know?

48:24.035 --> 48:26.938
Because I --
You're a neuropsychiatrist!

48:27.038 --> 48:29.107
You should have told me.

48:31.376 --> 48:33.244
You should have told me.

48:33.344 --> 48:36.247
Well,

to doing bad things
