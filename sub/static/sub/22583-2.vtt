00:02.300 --> 00:07.303
Come here.
What's the problem?

00:29.109 --> 00:34.886
Commander!

00:34.886 --> 00:41.304
- This can't be right. Did you run a diagnostic?
- Twice./ - Let's check those relays.

01:18.085 --> 01:23.376
Captain to the bridge.

01:23.376 --> 01:27.900
We're getting reports of anomalies from all over the ship.

01:27.900 --> 01:32.514
The warp field's fluctuating.

01:32.514 --> 01:34.792
Bridge to Engineering. Report.

01:34.792 --> 01:38.260
I don't get it, Captain. Half the plasma relays have reversed polarity.

01:39.134 --> 01:40.434
Shut down the reactor.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.283
I'm trying... but it's not cooperating.

01:43.657 --> 01:49.262
We're losing main power.

01:49.262 --> 01:51.392
Now!

02:03.224 --> 02:08.223
Song: "Faith of the Heart"
It's been a long road,

02:08.223 --> 02:11.224
Getting from there to here,

02:11.224 --> 02:14.224
It's been a long time,

02:14.224 --> 02:18.224
But my time is finally near,

02:18.224 --> 02:24.224
And I will see my dream come alive at last,

02:24.224 --> 02:26.224
I will touch the sky

02:26.224 --> 02:29.224
And they're not gonna hold me down no more,

02:29.224 --> 02:34.224
No they're not gonna change my mind,

02:34.224 --> 02:38.224
Cause I've got faith of the heart,

02:38.224 --> 02:41.224
I'm going where my heart will take me,

02:41.224 --> 02:44.224
I've got faith to believe,

02:44.224 --> 02:50.224
I can do anything,

02:50.224 --> 02:56.224
I've got strength of the soul,
But no one gonna bend or break me,

02:56.224 --> 03:02.224
I can reach any star,

03:02.224 --> 03:06.224
I've got faith,

03:06.224 --> 03:11.224
I've got faith, faith of the heart.

03:23.224 --> 03:25.503
054 (3x02) Anomaly

03:25.503 --> 03:31.793
I've restored emergency power but most of our primary systems are still off-line--including weapons.

03:31.793 --> 03:33.632
Trip, what's your status?

03:33.632 --> 03:39.032
We've got a hell of a mess down here, Captain.
It's gonna be a while before I can even figure out what just happened.

03:39.032 --> 03:41.672
Keep me posted.

03:41.672 --> 03:45.875
Sir, I'm picking up a vessel... eight million kilometers off port.

03:45.875 --> 03:46.838
What's their heading?

03:46.838 --> 03:51.700
Looks like they're holding position. Or they could be adrift.

03:51.700 --> 03:52.753
Hail them.

03:52.753 --> 03:55.831
Our transceiver's off-line.

03:55.831 --> 03:57.997
What's our best speed?

03:57.997 --> 03:59.970
One-quarter impulse.

03:59.970 --> 04:10.794
Set a course.

04:11.546 --> 04:14.635
Bio-signs?

04:14.635 --> 04:24.482
None, and there's no atmosphere aboard.
Artificial gravity's down as well.

04:24.482 --> 04:27.500
Any sign of what happened to them?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.509
No, sir.

04:34.438 --> 04:36.373
Have you spent much time in gravity boots, corporal?

04:36.373 --> 04:40.380
I did a six-week tour on Jupiter Station.
The grav-plating went down a few times.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.251
Only in simulations, sir.

04:42.251 --> 04:43.710
Same here, Captain.

04:43.710 --> 04:47.999
This is an alien ship we're boarding.
We could run into magnetic variances. Watch your step.

04:47.999 --> 04:49.311
Yes, sir.

04:49.311 --> 04:53.273
We're looking for anything that could tell us what happened to them.

04:53.273 --> 04:59.149
And don't forget--just because sensors didn't pick up any bio-signs doesn't mean we won't encounter anyone.

04:59.149 --> 05:00.792
Set weapons to stun.

05:00.792 --> 05:04.028
Aye, sir.

05:46.519 --> 05:48.529
Weapons fire.

06:01.839 --> 06:08.289
Captain.

06:08.289 --> 06:14.629
No external injuries.

06:14.629 --> 06:18.523
Let's find the bridge.

06:42.879 --> 06:47.506
Try to access that station.
Download what you can.

06:55.710 --> 06:57.663
We counted 17 bodies.

06:57.663 --> 07:04.651
Most of them died when their life support ran out.
The others were killed by particle weapons. What's our status?

07:04.651 --> 07:10.491
Ensign Sato's managed to bring the transciever on-line, but other than that...

07:12.951 --> 07:14.386
Archer to Mayweather.

07:14.386 --> 07:15.517
Go ahead, sir

07:15.517 --> 07:17.442
Resume our previous course, one-quarter impulse.

07:17.442 --> 07:19.228
Understood.

07:19.228 --> 07:24.736
It might be best to complete repairs before we head deeper into the Expanse. If we encounter any more anomalies...

07:24.736 --> 07:29.088
Those people have been dead...
Whoever attacked them could still be nearby.

07:29.088 --> 07:31.183
We'll have to make repairs on the move.

07:31.183 --> 07:34.531
Mr. Reed recovered some data from their bridge. See what you can make of it.

07:34.531 --> 07:41.558
Let's try it again. Watch that intermix ratio.

07:41.558 --> 07:49.888
Looking good. Bring her up 40%.

07:49.888 --> 07:53.806
Shut it down. Shut it down.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.040
How's it coming?

07:55.040 --> 07:56.838
Could be better.

07:56.838 --> 08:02.398
Creating a stable warp field isn't easy when the laws of physics won't cooperate.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.953
The Cochrane Equation--it's not constant here.

08:04.953 --> 08:12.972
The problem's in the quantum variables. Every time I try to compensate, the spatial gradients get thrown out of whack.

08:12.972 --> 08:18.577
Either we get away from these anomalies, or we're gonna have to rewrite the book on warp theory,

08:18.577 --> 08:22.010
and I don't have to tell you how long it took Zefram Cochrane the first time around.

08:22.010 --> 08:23.808
What about tactical systems?

08:23.808 --> 08:25.811
Weapons should be up and running within an hour or two.

08:25.811 --> 08:28.853
Make it a priority.

08:28.853 --> 08:30.110
You worried about something?

08:30.110 --> 08:34.712
Weapons, Trip, as quickly as you can.

08:34.712 --> 08:39.304
Where is Isaac Newton when you need him?

09:13.210 --> 09:14.125
Distance?

09:14.125 --> 09:16.699
3,000 meters and closing.

09:16.699 --> 09:18.566
They're charging weapons.

09:18.566 --> 09:20.644
Can you give me hull plating?

09:20.644 --> 09:22.973
I'm sorry, sir.

09:22.973 --> 09:26.856
Hail them.

09:28.103 --> 09:31.384
2000m

10:35.734 --> 10:37.725
Hold your fire.

10:39.369 --> 10:41.360
Are those warheads armed?

10:43.688 --> 10:46.170
Stun grenade.

11:02.343 --> 11:04.158
How many more?

11:04.758 --> 11:07.674
Two in Cargo Bay One. Four more in Engineering.

11:07.674 --> 11:09.901
Get down there and help Trip.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.181
Corporal!

11:12.181 --> 11:16.848
Woods, you're with me.

11:34.335 --> 11:37.623
They're trying to download our database.

11:37.623 --> 11:39.864
Lock them out.

13:18.822 --> 13:21.530
Increase his anaprovaline by 50mg

13:21.530 --> 13:23.419
How are they?

13:23.419 --> 13:26.995
Stable. However, they've suffered extensive disruptor burns.

13:26.995 --> 13:33.585
I'd like to start them on regeneration therapy, but the imaging chamber was damaged in the attack. I'll need a repair team as soon as possible.

13:33.585 --> 13:35.321
Understood.

13:46.474 --> 13:52.621
Crewman Fuller. I did everything I could.

13:52.621 --> 13:53.572
What about him?

13:53.572 --> 13:56.561
A few internal injuries. I'll need to keep him under observation.

13:56.561 --> 13:58.886
You can observe him in the brig.

13:58.886 --> 14:00.382
- See to it.
- Aye, sir.

14:00.382 --> 14:05.280
You might be interested to know that I recognize his species... he's Osaarian.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.947
He's not from the Expanse?

14:06.947 --> 14:09.777
Not originally.

14:13.492 --> 14:14.478
How bad is it?

14:14.478 --> 14:19.935
They made off with three photonic torpedoes, a case of plasma rifles, two dozen stun grenades.

14:19.935 --> 14:22.165
Chef says they cleaned out half the food stores,

14:22.165 --> 14:24.876
and Cargo Bay Two's been stripped to the bulkheads,

14:24.876 --> 14:29.302
but that's not the worst of it. They took every one of our antimatter storage pods.

14:29.302 --> 14:32.850
All we've got left is what's in the main reactor.

14:32.850 --> 14:34.476
How long will that last? A month?

14:34.476 --> 14:38.944
Tops. After that, we're out of gas.

14:46.089 --> 14:47.740
This is all you've got?

14:47.740 --> 14:52.150
The High Command hasn't had much contact with the Osaarians.

14:52.150 --> 14:57.841
They have a large merchant fleet, but there's no record of piracy.

14:57.841 --> 14:59.541
Any luck tracking their ship?

14:59.541 --> 15:03.482
Not yet. They found a way to mask their ion trail.

15:03.482 --> 15:08.407
For people with no history of piracy they've gotten pretty good at it.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.363
Keep looking.

15:11.363 --> 15:15.930
It appears they've adapted their weapons and engines to compensate for the anomalies.

15:15.930 --> 15:19.384
Pursuing them will be dangerous.
We should consider other alternatives.

15:19.384 --> 15:23.797
Such as what? Waiting for our antimatter to run dry?

15:23.797 --> 15:28.185
I'm only suggesting that we may be able to replenish our supplies elsewhere.

15:28.185 --> 15:30.663
Keep looking.

15:37.917 --> 15:40.974
Open it.

15:53.577 --> 15:56.608
Dr. Phlox said your injuries were minor.

16:01.207 --> 16:03.470
Please get up.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.857
Why?

16:05.857 --> 16:08.188
I have a dead crewman.

16:09.518 --> 16:11.366
I didn't kill him.

16:11.366 --> 16:16.680
No, one of your friends did.

16:16.680 --> 16:25.796
But I don't have one of your friends. I have you. So get up and look at me!

16:25.796 --> 16:30.937
Thank you. You're going to help me find your ship.

16:32.655 --> 16:39.299
And after I've taken back what they stole from me, you and your colleagues are free to go.

16:39.299 --> 16:43.875
If you went anywhere near that ship, you'd have more than one dead crewman.

16:43.875 --> 16:49.416
I can't help you. Even if I could,
my captain wouldn't be very interested in having me back, would he?

16:49.416 --> 16:53.167
Not after I told you where to find him.

16:53.167 --> 17:02.138
That's a risk you'll have to take... because the alternative is going to be a lot less pleasant.

17:02.138 --> 17:06.318
I don't think you'd be very comfortable torturing another man.

17:06.318 --> 17:10.992
You and your crewmates are far too civilized for that.

17:10.992 --> 17:12.009
Too moral.

17:12.009 --> 17:14.414
I need what was stolen from me.

17:14.414 --> 17:21.298
There's too much at stake to let my morality get in the way.

17:21.298 --> 17:28.659
You're obviously new to this Expanse.
If you weren't, your ship's hull would be insulated with trellium-D.

17:28.659 --> 17:34.175
Do you have any idea what a spatial distortion can do to a ship that is not insulated with trellium-D?

17:34.175 --> 17:38.423
What it can do... to the people inside that ship?

17:40.213 --> 17:45.163
You masked your ion trail.

17:45.163 --> 17:47.822
How?

17:47.822 --> 17:50.544
Well... my captain's a very clever man.

17:50.544 --> 17:59.482
He has to be. When you're forced to resort to desperate measures in order to survive, you have to be clever.

17:59.482 --> 18:02.117
You need to know how to hide.

18:02.117 --> 18:09.461
So you were forced into piracy?

18:09.461 --> 18:13.780
When we entered this Expanse, we were no different than you--

18:13.780 --> 18:20.457
two merchant ships looking for trade routes. Then the first distortion hit us.

18:20.457 --> 18:31.873
We decided to return home, but the perimeter-- the thermobaric clouds-- they let you in, but they don't let you out.

18:31.873 --> 18:35.523
One of our ships was destroyed trying.

18:35.523 --> 18:40.785
After a few more encounters with the anomalies it wasn't long before we became predators.

18:40.785 --> 18:46.132
This section of the Expanse proved to be ideal for hunting.

18:46.132 --> 18:57.625
When a ship runs aground due to spatial distortions... it becomes an easy target.

18:57.625 --> 19:02.081
Our captain told us we wouldn't harm anyone... and we didn't...

19:02.081 --> 19:04.453
not at first.

19:05.805 --> 19:09.248
It takes time to learn to kill without remorse.

19:09.248 --> 19:12.537
You're not prepared to kill,

19:12.537 --> 19:14.495
or torture.

19:14.495 --> 19:17.992
Not yet.

19:17.992 --> 19:20.914
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to find your ship.

19:20.914 --> 19:30.155
And if that ends up causing me remorse... then it's something I'm willing to live with.

19:30.155 --> 19:32.591
Think about it.

19:52.009 --> 19:59.092
I've been studying the data recovered from the derelict. Apparently, they decided to look for the Osaarians as well.

19:59.092 --> 20:03.605
They found a way to modify their sensors to detect the ion trail.

20:03.605 --> 20:07.231
But their life-support failed before they had a chance to start.

20:07.231 --> 20:09.614
Did they leave a record of the modifications?

20:09.614 --> 20:11.483
I've already given it to Ensign Mayweather.

20:11.483 --> 20:12.913
What's our tactical situation?

20:12.913 --> 20:16.528
Hull plating's back on line. We should have phase-cannons within the hour.

20:16.528 --> 20:17.279
Torpedoes?

20:17.279 --> 20:23.264
Lieutenant Reed is still having difficulty modifying the guidance systems to compensate for the anomalies.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.489
I'll be in the armory.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.387
Black tea, hot.

20:42.737 --> 20:46.157
You finished rewriting the physics books?

20:46.157 --> 20:49.475
I don't think I'll be taking home the Nobel Prize any time soon.

20:50.622 --> 20:53.497
A few hours rest might do you a world of good.

20:53.497 --> 20:56.174
No kidding.

20:56.174 --> 20:58.079
You still can't sleep?

20:58.079 --> 21:00.460
T'Pol's been trying to help.

21:00.460 --> 21:04.389
Showing me how to stimulate my neural nodes.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.732
It's not what you think.

21:06.732 --> 21:10.320
I wasn't thinking anything.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.991
How are the weapons coming?

21:12.991 --> 21:20.119
The Captain and I managed to bring the guidance systems on-line, but I'm going to need more time for the aft launchers.

21:20.119 --> 21:29.315
Fuller knew those torpedo systems better than anyone. He won't be easy to replace.

21:29.315 --> 21:36.011
Considering all the hostile aliens we've met, I suppose it's fortunate we haven't lost more people.

21:36.011 --> 21:39.686
I doubt he'll be the last.

21:39.686 --> 21:41.953
There's no reason to get cynical.

21:41.953 --> 21:48.258
Every species we run into seems to be gunning for us. We might as well paint a giant bull's-eye on the hull.

21:48.258 --> 21:53.290
What do you suggest we do, turn around and go back to Earth?

21:53.290 --> 22:00.048
All I'm saying is that this mission, whether it succeeds or not, is looking like a one-way ticket all the time.

22:01.775 --> 22:03.929
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.

22:03.929 --> 22:10.708
We've been tracking the Osaarians' ion trail for the past four hours.  There's still no sign of them.

22:10.708 --> 22:14.557
The trail ends about 20,000 kilometers ahead.

22:14.557 --> 22:18.522
Any sign of a ship?

22:18.522 --> 22:19.974
Nothing.

22:19.974 --> 22:21.965
T'Pol?

22:21.965 --> 22:29.289
The trail resumes after another 70,000 kilometers.

22:29.289 --> 22:33.936
Let's see it.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.525
Should I alter course?

22:35.525 --> 22:38.550
Not yet.

22:38.550 --> 22:41.649
Why would there be such a large gap?

22:41.649 --> 22:45.850
The ions may have been dispersed by stellar winds.

22:45.850 --> 22:48.584
There would still be some residual particles.

22:48.584 --> 22:53.161
Captain, the particle decay rates don't match.

22:53.161 --> 23:02.212
This one is at least nine hours old... this one was left less than an hour ago.

23:02.212 --> 23:15.694
Bring weapons on-line. Take us to where the first trail ends.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.804
Travis?

23:17.804 --> 23:28.942
I'm not reading anything.

23:28.942 --> 23:32.113
Power's fluctuating.

23:32.113 --> 23:36.982
- Forward plating's down.
- Micro-fractures are forming on the outer hull. We should come about.

23:36.982 --> 23:38.407
Keep going.

23:50.880 --> 23:56.230
- T'Pol.
- It's approximately 19 kilometers in diameter.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.417
Ever seen anything like it?

23:58.417 --> 24:00.674
No.

24:00.674 --> 24:03.563
It's constructed entirely of a single alloy.

24:03.563 --> 24:06.711
Who could build something that big?

24:06.711 --> 24:08.897
Take us in closer.

24:17.803 --> 24:23.222
That "cloaking field" is enormous. Whoever built this thing went to a great deal of trouble to conceal it.

24:23.222 --> 24:28.623
Judging from those ion trails, the Osaarians spent over eight hours here. I want to find out why.

24:28.623 --> 24:30.292
Any luck scanning the interior?

24:30.292 --> 24:32.778
Our sensors are being deflected.

24:32.778 --> 24:36.539
See if you can find something that looks like a way in.

24:36.539 --> 24:39.098
Take us into orbit.

24:50.656 --> 24:55.904
I'm detecting what appears to be a portal... 22 degrees north of our current position.

24:55.904 --> 25:00.493
Put it up.

25:00.493 --> 25:02.371
Can you tell what the door is made of?

25:02.371 --> 25:09.049
Polyduranium. The same metal as the Osaarians' hull.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.364
Can we fit through?

25:10.364 --> 25:14.955
Not with Enterprise.

25:14.955 --> 25:16.884
Then get a pod ready.

25:31.376 --> 25:33.816
I've cycled through the standard frequencies.

25:33.816 --> 25:35.351
Did you find the locking mechanism?

25:35.351 --> 25:37.458
On the lower-right side.

25:37.458 --> 25:39.892
Hold our position.

25:47.543 --> 25:49.988
Try it now.

25:58.311 --> 26:00.989
There's no indication of any ships, sir.

26:02.164 --> 26:03.994
Archer to Enterprise.

26:03.994 --> 26:06.748
Go ahead.

26:06.748 --> 26:08.573
We're heading in.

26:08.573 --> 26:10.127
Understood.

26:27.251 --> 26:31.678
There's enough energy running through here to power a dozen cities.

26:36.404 --> 26:38.483
What's that... down there?

26:49.024 --> 26:53.902
Those modules have a breathable atmosphere.

26:53.902 --> 26:56.006
Let's hope there's no one home.

26:56.006 --> 26:57.964
Do you see that docking port, Ensign?

26:57.964 --> 26:59.773
Yes, sir.

27:19.516 --> 27:22.434
We're all clear, sir.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.948
They've been busy.

27:33.948 --> 27:40.783
There are a lot of modules to search. Fan out. Keep open com-links.

27:50.123 --> 27:53.009
They're not gonna run out of stem bolts anytime soon.

27:55.356 --> 27:57.301
This way.

28:06.737 --> 28:09.073
Starfleet ration packs.

28:21.344 --> 28:22.718
Archer.

28:22.718 --> 28:27.833
I've found something, Captain.

28:27.833 --> 28:28.959
Travis?

28:28.959 --> 28:35.342
Over here, sir.

28:35.342 --> 28:38.608
I'm pretty sure it's a cargo manifest.

28:38.608 --> 28:40.113
How's your Osaarian?

28:40.113 --> 28:42.274
Not very good, sir.

28:42.274 --> 28:44.883
Download what you can. Get it to Hoshi.

28:44.883 --> 28:46.874
Tell T'Pol we're going to need another search team.

28:46.874 --> 28:48.213
Aye, sir.

28:51.754 --> 28:54.690
Check behind those canisters.

29:20.036 --> 29:29.085
Look at this.

29:56.627 --> 29:57.513
Commander?

29:57.513 --> 30:04.832
I had a little accident, Doc. I was reinstalling the deuterium injectors.
One of them must have had a little juice left in it.

30:04.832 --> 30:11.743
Second-degree burn. Hmm. Why don't you have a seat.

30:11.743 --> 30:18.187
I could have sworn that injector was depolarized. I guess I'm getting a little punchy.

30:18.187 --> 30:21.091
When's the last time you slept?

30:21.091 --> 30:23.206
I got a full hour last night.

30:23.206 --> 30:31.583
I'm surprised the neuro-pressure isn't helping. T'Pol told me your first treatment went well.

30:31.583 --> 30:33.340
Well, we only had the one session.

30:33.340 --> 30:35.656
Haven't had a lot of free time lately. Are you certain that's the reason?

30:35.656 --> 30:36.779
What do you mean?

30:36.779 --> 30:43.179
Vulcan neuro-pressure requires a certain degree of intimacy. I can understand that it might make you... uncomfortable.

30:43.179 --> 30:49.166
It doesn't make me uncomfortable.  I just can't afford to spend an hour every night in T'Pol's quarters.

30:49.166 --> 30:52.897
Can't you just give me another one of those injections? They put me out like a light.

30:52.897 --> 30:56.799
They're not meant to be taken for extended periods.

30:56.799 --> 31:00.495
There is another treatment that might be helpful.

31:00.495 --> 31:02.672
All right. What do you got?

31:02.672 --> 31:04.322
Aldeberan mud leeches.

31:04.322 --> 31:06.655
What am I supposed to do with them?

31:06.655 --> 31:09.962
Place one on your chest and one on your abdomen an hour before going to bed.

31:09.962 --> 31:12.958
Their secretions act as a natural sedative.

31:12.958 --> 31:19.006
Oh, uh, please, be careful to sleep on your back. If you roll over, you might anger them.

31:19.006 --> 31:22.678
Maybe an hour a night with T'Pol isn't so bad.

31:22.678 --> 31:27.290
The search teams have found nearly 80% of our antimatter. They're looking for the rest.

31:27.290 --> 31:30.752
Probably running through the reactor of that Osaarian ship.

31:30.752 --> 31:33.523
We've also recovered most of our weapons.

31:33.523 --> 31:34.746
How's Trip doing?

31:34.746 --> 31:38.317
He'll have warp drive on-line within the next 30 minutes.

31:38.317 --> 31:45.735
Have the Away Teams speed it up. I want to go to warp as soon as they're back.

31:45.735 --> 31:49.292
Quantum scans indicate it's nearly a thousand years old.

31:49.292 --> 31:50.476
What else?

31:50.476 --> 31:57.648
The structure contains seven fusion reactors. Each one is almost 12 kilometers long. Only three are still operational.

31:57.648 --> 32:00.026
Any idea what they were designed for?

32:00.026 --> 32:09.668
The Sphere is emitting massive amounts of gravimetric energy. It may have something to do with the spatial anomalies.

32:09.668 --> 32:11.986
Take as many scans as you can.

32:11.986 --> 32:14.463
Bridge to Captain Archer.

32:14.463 --> 32:15.941
Go ahead.

32:15.941 --> 32:18.904
Sir, could you come to the Situation Room?

32:21.461 --> 32:25.631
While I was translating the cargo manifest, something caught my eye.

32:25.631 --> 32:28.626
Look at these markings.

32:28.626 --> 32:34.446
I had to double-check, but I was pretty sure that I'd seen this ideography before.

32:34.446 --> 32:39.064
This is a piece of the Xindi probe that crashed on Earth.

32:39.064 --> 32:43.130
At least three of the symbols are an exact match.

32:50.516 --> 32:56.137
Your ship attacked a Xindi vessel.
I want to know everything you can tell me about them.

32:56.137 --> 32:59.746
Xindi?

32:59.746 --> 33:02.452
You heard me!

33:02.452 --> 33:04.409
I don't remember a species with that name.

33:04.409 --> 33:09.103
You're lying! The manifest said you took their ship less than two weeks ago!

33:09.103 --> 33:10.275
What manifest?

33:10.275 --> 33:13.949
Tell me what you know.

33:13.949 --> 33:17.074
It was a small ship. They were no match for us.

33:17.074 --> 33:20.166
Where are they now?

33:23.452 --> 33:25.325
You destroyed them?

33:25.325 --> 33:28.552
They resisted. We had no choice.

33:28.552 --> 33:29.963
Where did they come from?!

33:29.963 --> 33:34.275
I have better things to do than familiarize myself with our victims.

33:34.275 --> 33:38.001
Which species of Xindi were they? What did they look like?

33:38.001 --> 33:39.655
I don't remember.

33:44.448 --> 33:45.941
Are you sure?

33:45.941 --> 33:50.093
Your threats aren't very convincing. I told you, you're too civilized.

33:50.093 --> 33:51.834
We'll see about that.

33:53.854 --> 33:54.741
Sir.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.911
As you were.

33:56.911 --> 33:57.952
Ensign.

33:58.541 --> 34:00.644
Are you taking me to your torture chamber?

34:00.644 --> 34:03.077
Shut up.

34:03.077 --> 34:12.014
Get in.

34:12.014 --> 34:14.505
The Xindi...?

34:14.505 --> 34:17.547
This tactic doesn't suit you, Captain.

34:17.547 --> 34:24.886
This airlock has a decompression rate of point five atmospheres per minute.

34:31.994 --> 34:36.898
You'd better start talking now, because in about 40 seconds, you won't be able to.

34:39.002 --> 34:42.063
The Xindi!

34:42.338 --> 34:43.282
Captain?

34:43.282 --> 34:45.726
Everything's under control, Lieutenant.

34:45.726 --> 34:49.527
The airlock's decompressing, sir.

34:49.527 --> 34:50.530
He'll die.

34:50.530 --> 34:53.614
Not for another 20 seconds he won't.

34:53.614 --> 34:58.266
The Xindi!

34:58.266 --> 34:59.222
Sir?

34:59.222 --> 35:01.635
Your memory getting any better?

35:01.635 --> 35:04.819
Say again!

35:04.819 --> 35:06.285
Captain!

35:14.512 --> 35:16.909
Take him back to the brig.

35:18.134 --> 35:20.081
Let's go.

35:29.017 --> 35:31.751
Eventually.

35:31.751 --> 35:35.455
When they attacked the Xindi ship they took more than fuel and supplies.

35:35.455 --> 35:38.421
They downloaded their database.

35:38.421 --> 35:41.650
How close would we have to get to tap into their main computer?

35:41.650 --> 35:45.891
Pretty close. Less than a kilometer. But we need to have the access codes.

35:45.891 --> 35:48.231
He gave them to me. Here.

35:48.231 --> 35:51.931
They are heavily armed. Are you sure it's wise to engage them?

35:51.931 --> 35:54.620
I want that database. Go to tactical alert.

35:54.620 --> 35:58.009
Tell Trip we're going to need all the power he can spare for weapons and hull plating.

35:58.009 --> 36:00.464
Their ion trail has already started to decay.

36:00.464 --> 36:04.168
They're going to be hard to find.

36:04.168 --> 36:07.334
We're going to wait for them to find us, Travis.

36:19.770 --> 36:22.086
Something's passing through the cloaking field.

36:22.086 --> 36:25.518
Move us into position. Stand by.

36:28.589 --> 36:30.668
Have they detected us?

36:30.668 --> 36:32.975
Not yet.

36:45.411 --> 36:48.017
Open a channel.

36:48.017 --> 36:49.042
Go ahead.

36:49.042 --> 36:54.662
This is Captain Archer. Remember us? You probably noticed that our weapons are back online.

36:54.662 --> 36:57.467
You're outgunned, so stand down.

36:59.633 --> 37:00.811
They're moving off.

37:00.811 --> 37:03.551
One kilometer, Travis.

37:03.551 --> 37:06.419
Get ready.

37:06.419 --> 37:07.522
Hull plating's holding.

37:07.522 --> 37:09.484
They're heading back into the cloaking field.

37:09.484 --> 37:11.690
Stay with them.

37:24.657 --> 37:25.648
Hoshi?

37:25.648 --> 37:26.825
We're not close enough.

37:26.825 --> 37:29.676
Stand by.

37:29.676 --> 37:33.541
Another 50 meters.

37:33.541 --> 37:36.305
I'm into the computer.

37:40.685 --> 37:42.088
Anything?

37:42.088 --> 37:45.331
I haven't found the Xindi database.

37:48.439 --> 37:49.186
I'm losing them.

37:49.186 --> 37:51.900
Travis!

37:58.351 --> 38:01.161
Forward hull plating is off-line.

38:01.161 --> 38:02.401
I found it, Captain.

38:02.401 --> 38:04.705
- How long do you need?
- A few minutes.

38:06.983 --> 38:10.533
Hull fracture on E deck, section 14. We're venting atmosphere.

38:10.533 --> 38:12.301
Emergency bulkheads.

38:13.677 --> 38:16.293
They're getting too far away. I'm losing the com-link again.

38:16.293 --> 38:19.152
Our impulse drive's destabilizing.

38:19.152 --> 38:24.498
We've got to get out of the cloaking field, sir.

38:24.498 --> 38:27.854
Head back to the Sphere.

38:33.469 --> 38:36.111
- Where are they?
- Still inside the field.

38:36.111 --> 38:40.745
- How much did you get?
- About a third of it.

38:40.745 --> 38:45.663
Take us closer to that portal. Let's see if we can lure them back in here.

38:45.663 --> 38:50.571
Use our forward phase-cannon. Fire a single burst, minimum yield.

38:53.629 --> 38:57.872
- Travis?
- No sign of them.

38:57.872 --> 39:05.806
Again.

39:05.806 --> 39:10.351
That got their attention. They're coming through.

39:19.656 --> 39:21.767
Stay within a kilometer.

39:21.767 --> 39:23.228
Return fire.

39:23.228 --> 39:27.013
I'm back in.

39:27.013 --> 39:28.679
Can you take out their engines?

39:28.679 --> 39:32.642
Not without risking damage to their main computer.

39:33.467 --> 39:36.385
- Ensign?
- I've got 80%.

39:36.385 --> 39:38.148
85%

39:40.913 --> 39:44.473
Hull plating's off-line.They're targeting our reactor.

39:44.473 --> 39:45.402
I've got 90%.

39:45.402 --> 39:47.648
Good enough. Mr. Reed!

39:59.083 --> 40:03.991
- Their engines are down.
- Keep our weapons locked on them.

40:17.481 --> 40:26.722
Your codes worked. Get him out of there.

40:26.722 --> 40:30.169
Now that I've served my purpose, you're taking me back to the airlock?

40:30.169 --> 40:36.111
Escort him to the launch bay.

40:36.111 --> 40:40.198
We're taking you back to the Sphere.

40:40.198 --> 40:46.309
So you have let your morality get in the way after all.

40:47.906 --> 40:53.845
Mercy is not a quality that'll serve you well in the Expanse, Captain.

41:11.107 --> 41:15.747
Computer...

41:15.747 --> 41:19.146
load the Xindi database.
