WEBVTT

00:31.031 --> 00:34.031
Four, three, two, one!

01:12.505 --> 01:15.274
Steve, please look at
these camp brochures.

01:15.275 --> 01:18.275
Dad, for the millionth time,
I don't wanna go to summer camp.

01:18.645 --> 01:21.513
But Camp Pocanda's got a lake.

01:21.514 --> 01:24.514
Steve! Come with me
if you wanna live!

01:24.818 --> 01:26.852
At home this summer!

01:30.757 --> 01:33.757
Ahh.
Basil and snail poison.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.228
The sweet smell of summer.

01:36.229 --> 01:38.764
Hey, you should plant some of those, uh-

01:38.765 --> 01:41.765
I don't know what you call them here-
Hitler melons.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.339
Good news. I found a camp
that still has an opening.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.541
Dad, I don't wanna go to camp.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.177
It's hot, and there's always something
crawling in your sleeping bag...

01:52.178 --> 01:54.313
like a spider or a counselor.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.682
Just let me tend to my posies!

01:56.683 --> 01:58.984
Stan, he doesn't wanna go to camp.

01:58.985 --> 02:01.887
I spent my summers at camp,
and I had the time of my life.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.889
I want him to have
that same experience.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.891
And, besides, gardening's gay.

02:05.892 --> 02:08.827
I,ll have you know
James Coburn had a garden.

02:08.828 --> 02:11.828
I,m sick of your lies about Coburn!

02:13.867 --> 02:16.867
These are mean streets we live on.
Streetssoakedwithblood

02:17.770 --> 02:20.770
I just fished a dead hooker
out ofthe canal.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.941
Roger, what areyou talking about?

02:22.942 --> 02:25.577
Oh, it's my new hard-boiled
P.I. character.

02:25.578 --> 02:28.578
I find role-playing helps me cope with
the soul-crushing boredom around this place.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.217
- May I proceed?
- Uh, okay.

02:32.218 --> 02:35.218
Shutyour hole, crazy broad.
I had to call that poor dead girl's parents.

02:36.189 --> 02:38.857
Doyou have any idea
what that's like? Doyou?

02:38.858 --> 02:41.827
Damn this city!

02:41.828 --> 02:44.828
And scene.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.700
All the camps are full, so we,ll just
make our own in the backyard.

02:51.070 --> 02:54.070
It,ll be like Meatballs. I,ll be Bill Murray
and you,ll be that kid that no one remembers.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.375
One tent, please. He was also in
MyBodyguard Terrific film.

02:58.778 --> 03:00.779
What the hell is his name?

03:00.780 --> 03:03.780
Sorry. All our tents have been donated.
We,re shipping them offto some camp.

03:04.384 --> 03:07.384
Did you say camp? Is there anyway
you can get my kid in this camp?

03:07.820 --> 03:10.820
- Well, it's pretty overcrowded.
- My son doesn't take up much space.

03:11.724 --> 03:14.724
And neither does
my good friend Ben Franklin.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.195
Yeah, he fits in yourjeans
real nice. Don'tyou, Ben?

03:19.265 --> 03:21.433
- Indubitably.
- Dad

03:21.434 --> 03:23.902
Steve, camp is an amazing place.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.305
You get to swim in the lake,
drink bugjuice...

03:26.306 --> 03:28.740
ring the bell ifyou win
the camp Olympics.

03:28.741 --> 03:31.176
Oh, and then there's camp love.

03:31.177 --> 03:33.612
It's such an intense experience...

03:33.613 --> 03:36.613
like winning the Grammy for
Best R&B Performance, Duo or Group.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.916
Dad, for the last time,
you were not in Boyz II Men.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.490
So it's settled.
Be sure to write.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.894
How could you send Steve off
to some camp you know nothing about?

03:51.598 --> 03:54.333
I,m not an idiot, Francine.
I have a receipt and a tracking number.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.335
He's with some tents. It's fine.

03:56.336 --> 03:59.336
Look, it's a legitimate place.
It's called "Camp Refoogee....

03:59.606 --> 04:02.341
It doesn't say "Refoogee....
It says "Refugee....

04:02.342 --> 04:05.310
You sent our son to a refugee camp?

04:05.311 --> 04:07.913
Has anybody seen a Care Bears towel?

04:07.914 --> 04:10.182
It-It had Luck Bear on the front.

04:10.183 --> 04:13.183
I think you call it 'Luck Bear"
because he had a clover on his chest.

04:13.286 --> 04:16.286
Oh, lalsohada collapsible cup.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.160
Just so we,re clear, you will not return home
from Africa without my son.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.899
I,m going with you.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.900
If I could just hold a refugee's hand and look
them in the eye, they,ll know someone cares.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.438
Okay, Bono. Settle down.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.286
So this is a refugee camp.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.287
I have to say, not that bad.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.392
There's sun, sand.
It's like Arizona.

04:53.393 --> 04:56.328
Although here they probably celebrate
Martin Luther King Day.

04:56.329 --> 04:59.329
Look, the U.N. is here.
I,m gonna go ask them how I can help.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.599
Okay, but the plane leaves in 30 minutes.

05:02.702 --> 05:05.702
Hello. Stan Smith, American,
32-inch vertical leap.

05:06.272 --> 05:09.272
- I,m looking for my son.
- You must mean the white boy

05:09.275 --> 05:12.275
Oh, come on. Why does it always
have to be a racial thing with you blacks?

05:12.645 --> 05:15.213
- I can take you to him.
- Thank you. What's your name?

05:15.214 --> 05:17.783
I am Wobuto Kowonga Komali.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.784
I,ll call you Hot Rod.

05:24.290 --> 05:27.290
Wong's Imperial Wok. You order Empress Plate?

05:28.227 --> 05:31.163
What? Too broad or not broad enough?

05:31.164 --> 05:33.999
,Cause I,ve got some incredibly
racist buckteeth in my pocket.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.001
You won't like yourself,
buyout,ll laugh.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.002
Oh, Roger, I,m just feeling
lonely without Steve.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.973
We were supposed to go
to an art opening tomorrow.

05:41.974 --> 05:44.076
Art opening? Hell, I,ll go.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.077
I got this college professor character
I,ve been dying, to try out.

05:47.547 --> 05:50.547
- Hey, you should do a character too.
- I don't know.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.518
Oh, come on.
It,ll help you pull your head out ofthe oven.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.519
Now, who you gonna be? And it's crucial
that it be organic to my professor character.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.790
Um- Oh, how about
a professor's wife?

06:01.260 --> 06:04.129
Eh, I don't really care.
You owe me 32.50.

06:04.130 --> 06:07.130
- This is a spilled can of motor oil.
- No substitution!

06:08.901 --> 06:11.370
Steve! Steve!

06:11.371 --> 06:14.371
Dad! Mmm!

06:14.640 --> 06:16.641
Dad, get me out of here.

06:16.642 --> 06:19.642
I just wanna go home and never think
about stupid camp again.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.748
Stupid camp? No. No, camp is good.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.749
If only I could make you see.

06:27.019 --> 06:30.019
That's it! Steve, you,re not gonna
miss out on camp after all.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.625
- We,re staying in Africa.
- What?

06:33.626 --> 06:36.626
We,ve got tents, a river, campers-
everything we need is here.

06:36.996 --> 06:39.996
People, listen up.
I,ve got great news.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.700
We,re turning this hot, dusty wasteland
into what it should,ve been all along:

06:44.337 --> 06:47.337
a summer camp.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.875
Welcome to Camp "Refoogee....

06:49.876 --> 06:52.177
By the way,
this kind of fun isn't free.

06:52.178 --> 06:55.178
I,m gonna need checks
from all your parents.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.620
How can you all gorge yourselves
on roast beef while refugees starve?

07:04.991 --> 07:07.991
I, for one, am going to spend my short time here
outside helping those poor people.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.399
Hey, that's our plane.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.535
Dad, what's going on?

07:16.536 --> 07:19.536
We,re staying for a few weeks
and turning this place into a summer camp.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.340
A few weeks?

07:22.341 --> 07:24.643
Steak, medium.
A little pink in the middle.

07:24.644 --> 07:27.644
Pinker than that.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.986
Okay, remember,
I,m Professor Jordan Edelstein.

07:34.987 --> 07:37.622
My key stats:
I.Q 140, nearsighted...

07:37.623 --> 07:40.623
and I once spent a sexually experimental
weekend with Allen Ginsberg.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.695
And I,m Amanda Lane.
I didn't take your name.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.697
That's fine,
,cause you converted for me.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.133
Your parents weren't too happy
about you marrying a Hebrew.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.134
But then my book started selling,
and they changed that tune right quick.

07:51.437 --> 07:54.239
I was thinking we,ve been
married about 17 years.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.240
Perfect. And I,m the head ofthe political science
department at Harvard, thank you very much.

07:58.344 --> 08:01.344
Political science?
You should be an economics professor.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.849
What? No, I make my own back story.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.851
Besides, I freaking, hate economics.

08:05.852 --> 08:08.852
Fine. Ifyou wanna waste your life
with political science, go ahead.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.389
God, you sound just like your mother.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.826
You,re just slightly better at this than I expected.

08:22.201 --> 08:25.201
That horseshoe pit's really coming along there-
What's his name?

08:25.905 --> 08:27.906
Rassan Bikila Mossi.

08:27.907 --> 08:30.442
Well done, Skittles!

08:30.443 --> 08:32.443
Get up, Steve!

08:32.445 --> 08:34.679
When I was at camp,
I never sat around doing nothing.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.681
I played sports, I wrote cheers.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.518
I was the first one to rhyme
"Ooh, ungawa... with "powa....

08:39.519 --> 08:41.785
Didn't copyright it.
Lost millions.

08:41.787 --> 08:44.787
Dad, no matter what you do,
I,ll never have your camp experience...

08:44.991 --> 08:47.559
because this place is never
gonna be a real summer camp.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.928
Right on time.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.929
lorderedanairdrop from the CIA.
We'rein desperate need of supplies.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.966
- Uncle Stan, is it freshwater?
- Better.

08:56.969 --> 08:59.871
- Malaria pills?
- Better.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.407
- It looks like fruit.
- Are they Hitler melons?

09:02.408 --> 09:05.408
No. What? No, they,re tether balls.
Oh, and look at this.

09:06.145 --> 09:09.145
Camp T-shirts!

09:10.149 --> 09:13.149
E! Entertainment?
This sucks. I wanna go home.

09:32.038 --> 09:35.038
- Hi, I,m Makeva. You,re Uncle Stan's son.
- Thank you.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.042
So, I,m going to the camp dance tonight.
Maybe I,ll see you there.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.680
- Someone's robbing, the cradle of civilization.
- Dad!

09:44.317 --> 09:46.551
Makeva!Dinner!

09:46.552 --> 09:49.552
Got it!

09:50.156 --> 09:53.156
Oh, man. It is so on.
You just found your camp love.

09:53.893 --> 09:55.627
- Pound it.
- Dad, I-

09:55.628 --> 09:58.628
Pound it!
This is the real thing, Steve.

09:58.731 --> 10:01.731
I still remember my first camp love,
Tommy Bennett.

10:01.901 --> 10:04.235
No. No, Amy Bennett.
Why would I say Tommy?

10:04.236 --> 10:07.236
Anyway, I,ve never felt that way before
and I haven't since.

10:07.406 --> 10:10.406
Just three words of advice:
Hall & Oates. Chicks dig,em.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.078
Okay, campers, time for the swim tests,
so just jump right in.

10:15.848 --> 10:18.848
We never go in the water.
It is too close to the Bawango rebel camp.

10:20.686 --> 10:23.521
Ah, yes. The rich kids, camp.

10:23.522 --> 10:26.522
No. They are the ones who destroyed
our village and forced us here.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.294
Mm-hmm. Our old rivals.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.696
Well, I think it's time
they were taken down a notch.

10:31.697 --> 10:34.697
Be cautious. They are a fierce people
who refuse to make peace.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.469
Make peace! Chris Make peace.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.704
That was the kid from Meatballs. Thank you.

10:39.705 --> 10:42.040
Their leader, Ozomatli, is a cruel man.

10:42.041 --> 10:45.041
Oh, boy, I,m not feeling so good.
I,m sweaty, queasy.

10:45.444 --> 10:48.444
I think I got a bad case of...
full moon fever!

10:51.617 --> 10:53.618
What the hell is this?

10:53.619 --> 10:56.619
Apologies, General Ozomatli.
That is my kaleidoscope.

10:56.622 --> 10:59.622
Congratulations.
You just lost an arm.

11:00.026 --> 11:03.026
Oh, wait, wait. Let me just get
the stuff out of my left pocket.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.903
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, that's okay. I,m Rick, and this is Candy.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.842
I,m Amanda, and this is my husband,Jordan.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.843
We just moved to Langley Falls.
Rick's a pediatrician, and I teach first grade.

11:21.547 --> 11:24.115
That's gotta be good for business.
She trips,em on the playground...

11:24.116 --> 11:27.116
then sends,em your way for bandaging.

11:27.887 --> 11:30.887
They,re onto us, Cand.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.426
Well, it was nice meeting you two.

11:34.427 --> 11:37.427
That was so fun.
I wish it didn't have to end.

11:37.730 --> 11:40.730
- Let's have,em over for dinner.
- Oh, Stan doesn't like dinner parties.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.034
Well, I don't know who
this Stan yutz is...

11:43.035 --> 11:46.035
but you,re married to Professor Jordan Edelstein,
Ph. D., and he fancies a dinner party.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.808
Great! Let's have,em
over for shabbas.

11:49.809 --> 11:52.809
Shh! keep yuor voice down.
We,re at the club.

11:53.079 --> 11:56.079
Alright. Camp Refoogee...

11:56.549 --> 11:59.549
we got a special request dedication
from Skittles to Little Oprah.

12:08.260 --> 12:11.229
This necklace has a tooth
from the snake I killed.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.698
With it you,ll always have
the heart of Africa.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.541
Open your mouth, lead with the tongue

12:23.542 --> 12:25.543
Dad.

12:25.544 --> 12:27.545
That's how I kissed
Amy Bennett at camp.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.814
I don't want your camp experience, okay?

12:29.815 --> 12:32.815
I was making my own experience,
and you ruined it. Makeva!

12:44.830 --> 12:46.831
Uncle Stan, it's the Bawango!

12:46.832 --> 12:49.801
Camp Bawango?
Oh, it's a panty raid!

12:49.802 --> 12:52.036
I was not expecting that.
Touche, rich kids.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.307
Oh, that seems a bit excessive.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.977
No! Steve!

12:58.978 --> 13:00.979
Hey, take the panties,
leave the girl!

13:00.980 --> 13:03.281
Dad, they just kidnapped Makeva!

13:03.282 --> 13:06.251
All right, I understand "kidnapped...
but what is "Makeva...?

13:06.252 --> 13:09.252
Aw, I bet that little girl
they stole could,ve told me.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.162
No!

13:17.163 --> 13:19.464
Mr. Tether ball!

13:19.465 --> 13:22.465
Oh, your days of pole-wrapping are through, sir.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.937
And I salute you.

13:25.938 --> 13:28.373
Dad, you have to help me
get Makeva back.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.809
But I don't know what to do.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.378
"I don't know what to do....
You can act like a man!

13:33.379 --> 13:35.880
There's no hitting at Camp Refoogee.

13:35.881 --> 13:38.881
Look, the Bawango rebels ruined our camp
and took one of your campers.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.554
Areyou gonna let them
get away with that?

13:42.555 --> 13:45.555
Don't move, Steve. Just give,em your credit card
and we,ll cancel it when we get home.

13:46.358 --> 13:49.358
Dad, these are your campers.
They,re rallying around you.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.930
Oh, yes, right. Right.
Thanks, fellas.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.566
You,re right, Steve.
We,ve gotta get your girl.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.567
And there's only one way
to deal with these vicious rebels.

13:58.204 --> 14:01.204
- Camp Olympics?
- That's right. We challenge you.

14:02.074 --> 14:04.843
- I accept the challenge.
- If we win...

14:04.844 --> 14:07.312
we get the girl,
and the refugees get their land back.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.480
And ifwe win, we get the girl...

14:09.481 --> 14:12.481
and the beautiful
E! Entertainment Television T-shirts.

14:12.818 --> 14:14.853
Hmm.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.921
- Dad!
- Fine, fine.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.922
You,re on.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.261
Now, that lamp there
we bought back in,89.

14:23.262 --> 14:26.231
I remember the year,cause Amanda
and I had just seen Old Gringo..

14:26.232 --> 14:29.232
and I wanted something heavy
to bash my head in.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.736
You have a story for everything,
even the wallpaper.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.975
- Where did you say it was from?
- Egypt.

14:36.976 --> 14:39.976
We were there while Jordan was doing research
for his economics dissertation.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.248
Mandy, a moment?

14:43.249 --> 14:46.249
I told you, I don't study economics.
I,m a political scientist.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.988
That's right.
Oh, well, too late now.

14:49.989 --> 14:52.989
I said economics.
It's been established.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.594
Candy.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.633
Uh, how much you weigh, Candy?
A hundred, we figure. Maybe 105?

15:04.670 --> 15:06.704
I guess about that.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.641
Mm-hmm. Pretty fit, tight.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.642
- My wife used to look like you.
- Let's not get nasty, Professor.

15:13.512 --> 15:16.512
I,m just saying to the attractive girl
that you used to look good...

15:17.049 --> 15:19.884
- before you went to rehab.
- I never went to rehab.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.885
You have now.
It's been established.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.898
Let the games begin!

16:28.020 --> 16:31.020
The fourth guy
I should,ve married instead of Jordan...

16:31.290 --> 16:33.658
was Bradford Dorne III.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.659
He had a yacht...
and a backbone.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.895
You,re boring our guests
with your pathetic rants, dear.

16:39.965 --> 16:42.233
Make me another drink,Jordan.

16:42.234 --> 16:45.234
He justifies his existence
by mixing a passable cocktail.

16:46.705 --> 16:49.507
Yes, love. Whatever love wants.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.076
- Amanda wears a hairpiece.
- What?

16:52.077 --> 16:55.077
Oh, yeah. Worst case of female pattern baldness
the doctor's ever seen.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.081
Well, maybe ifyou,d studied medicine
rather than economics, you,d be able to help me.

17:01.487 --> 17:04.487
In the words of every sitcom
character in the early,90s...

17:04.522 --> 17:07.522
and everyone in the Midwest through
the rest ofthe,90s, "Don't go there....

17:08.227 --> 17:10.228
Come on, Professor.

17:10.229 --> 17:13.229
Tell the kids about all
the economics conventions you attend...

17:13.799 --> 17:16.799
discussing economics
with the economics people.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.813
Tell them how you killed
our baby, Amanda.

17:28.814 --> 17:31.616
- Jordan, no!
- Real, real tragedy.

17:31.617 --> 17:34.617
Amanda was drunk, of course,
and she wasn't watching the pool.

17:34.953 --> 17:37.953
We were at Lake Geneva.
I was receiving an award for my work in-

17:38.657 --> 17:41.657
What was it, dear? Economics!

17:42.161 --> 17:45.161
I wanted to have another child,
but her uterus was polluted from all the syphilis.

17:45.964 --> 17:48.964
You bastard!

17:49.568 --> 17:52.568
Wait! Wait!

17:55.207 --> 17:58.207
The score is tied leading into
the final event, the footrace.

17:59.545 --> 18:02.545
I wanna run, Dad.
It's my girl, my race.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.415
I,m proud of you, Son.
All of Camp Refoogee is behind you.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.353
So keep your hand on your wallet.
I,m sorry. I,m sorry.

18:09.354 --> 18:12.354
I- I can't help myself.
I,m terrible.

18:17.696 --> 18:20.696
With this you'll always have the heart of Africa.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.901
Stevie, bombaye!

18:23.902 --> 18:26.902
Stevie, bombaye!

18:37.282 --> 18:40.218
Guys, there's a lion.
Guys? Lion.

18:42.221 --> 18:45.221
- Never mind.
- Way to go, champ!

18:45.724 --> 18:48.659
Oh! Here comes your girl.
Get ready for your victory kiss.

18:48.660 --> 18:51.660
Don't think of Tommy Bennett.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.565
But I-I won the race for you.

18:54.566 --> 18:57.566
I,m sorry, Steve,
but I,m kind ofa crazy chick.

19:04.376 --> 19:06.444
- Is it over?
- Yes.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.946
- Are we going to be okay?
- Yes.

19:08.947 --> 19:11.947
Doyou think maybe the baby
couldn't have drowned in the pool?

19:12.484 --> 19:15.153
No, you left the gate open,
and she sank like a stone.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.154
You have to live with that
for the rest of your life.

19:30.702 --> 19:33.371
Hey, champ.
Camp love can be tough, huh?

19:33.372 --> 19:36.073
How would you know?
You got your camp love.

19:36.074 --> 19:39.074
- Actually, I didn't.
- What?

19:39.444 --> 19:42.444
I loved Amy Bennett,
but the part I didn't tell you was...

19:42.681 --> 19:44.682
she didn't love me back.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.084
She broke my heart.

19:47.085 --> 19:50.085
Wow. I guess I ended up having
your camp experience after all.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.791
Yeah, I guess you did.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.294
Hey, Steve, you know
the good thing about first love?

19:56.295 --> 19:58.396
It's the first of many.

19:58.397 --> 20:00.398
So how,d you get over Amy?

20:00.399 --> 20:03.399
Well, Son, as you grow older,
you,ll find that the hurt fades away-

20:03.735 --> 20:06.735
Why, Amy? Why don'tyou love me?

20:10.042 --> 20:12.043
It's gonna be okay, Dad.

20:12.044 --> 20:15.044
Don'tyou dare patronize me! Amy! Amy!

20:21.086 --> 20:24.086
I don't wanna live!

20:29.161 --> 20:31.362
Thank God we,re going home.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.631
I think I gained the African 20.

20:33.632 --> 20:36.200
Seriously, I threw away
more food than I ate.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.269
Everyone is on the busses
and ready to go.

20:38.270 --> 20:41.270
I hate the last day of camp. You better
write me when you get home, H. Rod.

20:42.207 --> 20:45.076
We don't have homes.
The rebels destroyed everything.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.077
Oh, right. I guess I don't like thinking
about your horrible situation.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.116
Just like the rest ofthe world.

20:52.117 --> 20:54.852
Shame on you!

20:54.853 --> 20:57.853
All right, dude.
Take it easy.

20:59.024 --> 21:01.559
Thanks, Dad. Camp was awesome!

21:01.560 --> 21:03.728
Yeah, we,ll never forget these guys.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.729
Hot Rod, Skittles, Brooklyn Pete...

21:06.999 --> 21:09.999
Spark Plug, Riuniti, Whitey-

21:10.535 --> 21:13.535
Oh, that's you. Steve.
