01:35.609 --> 01:41.212
War began between
Germany and France on August 3, 1914.

01:42.080 --> 01:46.930
Five weeks later, the German army had
smashed its way to within 18 miles of Paris.

01:47.262 --> 01:51.243
There, the battered French miraculously
rallied their forces at the Marne River...

01:51.590 --> 01:55.237
and in a series of unexpected
counterattacks drove the Germans back.

01:55.975 --> 01:59.136
The front was stabilized,
hen shortly afterward developed...

01:59.166 --> 02:02.315
into a continuous line
of heavily fortified trenches...

02:02.345 --> 02:07.721
zigzagging their way 500 miles from
the English Channel to the Swiss frontier.

02:08.633 --> 02:12.354
By 1916, after two
grisly years of trench warfare...

02:12.600 --> 02:14.843
the battle lines had changed very little.

02:15.711 --> 02:18.968
Successful attacks were
measured in hundreds of yards...

02:19.257 --> 02:22.254
and paid for in lives
by hundreds of thousands.

02:25.886 --> 02:27.281
- General Broulard sir.

02:27.311 --> 02:29.597
- Hello George, how are you?
- Paul...

02:29.627 --> 02:32.174
wonderful seeing you again, really wonderful.

02:32.530 --> 02:37.066
Well, this splendid, superb.

02:38.229 --> 02:40.981
Well, I've tried to create
a pleasant atmosphere in which to work.

02:41.011 --> 02:44.050
Well, you succeeded marvelously.
I wish I had your taste in carpets.

02:44.688 --> 02:47.510
- And pictures.
- You're much too kind George, much too kind.

02:47.540 --> 02:48.998
- Sit down George.
- Thank you.

02:49.028 --> 02:52.986
I really haven't done very much, the place
is much the same as it was when I moved in.

02:54.979 --> 02:58.365
Paul, I've come to
see you about something big.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.019
It's top secret.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.806
And must go no further than
your chief of staff and not to him...

03:03.122 --> 03:05.946
- unless you can trust his discretion.
- Of course.

03:06.354 --> 03:09.370
A group of armies is forming on
this front for an offensive very soon.

03:09.570 --> 03:11.860
Headquarters is determined
to make a complete breakthrough.

03:12.023 --> 03:14.202
- Why you smiling?
- I'm really sorry.

03:14.439 --> 03:17.381
I thought for just a moment I knew
what you were going to say please go on.

03:17.915 --> 03:20.837
I never knew you were a mind
reader, what you think I was about to say?

03:22.011 --> 03:24.809
- Something about the Anthill.
- You are a mind reader.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.773
Well, it is a key
position, it's in my sector.

03:28.466 --> 03:30.408
To be perfectly honest I've heard some talk.

03:30.615 --> 03:33.032
You know, there's nothing
really secret around headquarters.

03:33.062 --> 03:34.048
Well, what do you think?

03:34.167 --> 03:36.652
Well, it's the key to the whole
German position in this sector.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.705
They've held on to it for a year now...

03:38.912 --> 03:41.348
and it looks as though they'll hold on
to it for another year if they want to.

03:41.617 --> 03:44.671
Paul, I have formal orders
to take the Anthill no later than the 10th.

03:44.701 --> 03:45.768
That's the day after tomorrow.

03:45.887 --> 03:48.140
That comes pretty close to
being ridiculous, don't you think?

03:48.170 --> 03:50.341
I don't imagine I'd be
here if I really thought that.

03:52.616 --> 03:56.477
Paul, if there's one man in this
army who can do this for me, it's you.

03:57.033 --> 04:00.059
It's out of the question George,
absolutely out of the question.

04:00.445 --> 04:02.076
My division was cut to pieces.

04:02.521 --> 04:05.930
What's left of it is in no position to
even hold the Anthill, let alone take it.

04:06.123 --> 04:07.664
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

04:09.243 --> 04:10.347
Well Paul...

04:11.193 --> 04:12.744
it's something else I wanted to tell you.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.617
However, I'm sure that you'll
misunderstand my motives in mentioning it.

04:15.647 --> 04:20.047
- What was it?
- Oh, you'd be bound to misunderstand.

04:20.382 --> 04:23.733
However, as your friend
I guess I should tell you.

04:24.081 --> 04:26.607
- What you trying to say George?
- Paul...

04:26.943 --> 04:30.002
talk around headquarters is that you
are being considered for the 12th Corps.

04:30.657 --> 04:33.207
- The 12th Corps?
- Yes and with that, another star.

04:33.358 --> 04:34.716
Now, I've pushed it all I can.

04:35.250 --> 04:38.094
12th Corps needs a fighting
general and you're overdue on that star.

04:38.691 --> 04:40.921
We both know
that your record is good enough...

04:40.951 --> 04:43.398
for you to refuse this assignment
on the grounds you've stated.

04:43.804 --> 04:47.547
No one would question your opinion.
They simply get someone else to do the job.

04:48.393 --> 04:51.824
So you shouldn't let this
influence your opinion Paul.

04:54.026 --> 04:56.888
- Oh, I'm sorry, have a cognac?
- No, thanks Paul, not before dinner.

05:01.489 --> 05:04.757
George, I'm responsible
for the lives of 8,000 men.

05:06.194 --> 05:08.118
What is my ambition against that?

05:09.069 --> 05:11.353
What is my reputation in comparison to that?

05:12.361 --> 05:16.249
My men come first of all
George and those men know it too.

05:16.279 --> 05:17.542
I know that they do.

05:17.762 --> 05:21.367
You see George, those men know
that I would never let them down.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.612
That goes without saying.

05:22.642 --> 05:25.126
The life of one of those soldiers
means more to me than all the...

05:25.156 --> 05:27.515
stars and decorations and honors in France.

05:28.146 --> 05:29.166
So...

05:30.510 --> 05:34.267
you think this attack is absolutely beyond
the ability of your men at this time?

05:34.731 --> 05:36.423
I didn't say that George.

05:37.814 --> 05:41.342
Nothing is beyond those men,
once their fighting spirit is aroused.

05:41.372 --> 05:44.146
But Paul, I don't want to push
you into it if you think it's ill advised.

05:44.176 --> 05:47.351
Don't worry George,
you couldn't do that if you tried.

05:49.020 --> 05:51.535
Of course, artillery would
make an enormous difference.

05:52.428 --> 05:54.879
- What artillery support can you give me?
- Well, I'll see.

05:55.696 --> 05:56.878
What about replacements?

05:57.040 --> 06:00.262
We'll see what we can do, but I feel sure
that you can get along with you have.

06:01.189 --> 06:03.836
- Might just do it.
- Oh Paul.

06:03.866 --> 06:07.916
I knew that I was right to come to you.
You are the man to take the Anthill.

06:07.946 --> 06:10.797
- About that star is concerned.
- That had nothing to do with my decision.

06:11.122 --> 06:14.696
- If anything, would sway me the other way.
- I realize that perfectly Paul.

06:14.981 --> 06:16.963
Now, when do you say you see this coming off?

06:16.993 --> 06:21.240
- No later than the day after tomorrow.
- We just might do it.

06:43.469 --> 06:46.406
Hello there soldier,
ready to kill more Germans?

06:46.436 --> 06:48.330
- Yes sir.
- What's your name soldier?

06:48.360 --> 06:50.010
Sir, Private Ferol, Company A.

06:50.376 --> 06:52.061
- You married, Private?
- No sir.

06:52.091 --> 06:54.753
- Well, I'll bet your mother is proud of you.
- Yes sir.

06:54.783 --> 06:57.187
Well, carry on Private and good luck to you.

06:57.623 --> 06:58.861
Yes sir, thank you sir.

07:04.198 --> 07:05.737
- Good morning General.
- Good morning.

07:06.326 --> 07:09.307
Hello there soldier,
ready to kill more Germans?

07:09.337 --> 07:12.014
- Yes sir.
- Working over your rifle I see.

07:12.347 --> 07:14.764
Well, that's the way,
it's a soldier's best friend.

07:14.794 --> 07:17.263
You be good to it
and it'll always be good to you.

07:17.293 --> 07:17.997
Yes sir.

07:22.019 --> 07:23.924
Well, good luck to you soldier.

07:24.161 --> 07:25.324
- Carry on.
- Thank you sir.

07:52.326 --> 07:53.527
Hello there soldier.

07:54.431 --> 07:56.136
Ready to kill more Germans?

07:58.152 --> 08:01.636
- Well, is everything all right soldier?
- All right?

08:02.398 --> 08:06.470
- Yes sir, I'm all right.
- Good fellow, are you married soldier?

08:06.730 --> 08:09.278
Married? Me married?

08:09.958 --> 08:14.084
- Yes, have you got a wife?
- A wife? Have I got a wife?

08:14.114 --> 08:15.821
Sir, he's a bit shell shocked.

08:16.067 --> 08:19.889
I beg your pardon Sergeant,
there is no such thing as shell shock.

08:20.903 --> 08:23.725
- Have you got a wife soldier?
- My wife?

08:24.565 --> 08:28.835
My wife? Yes, I have a wife.
I'm never going to see her again.

08:29.628 --> 08:31.169
- Going to be killed.
- Get a grip on yourself.

08:31.199 --> 08:32.910
- You're acting like a coward.
- I am a coward sir.

08:32.941 --> 08:34.038
Snap out of it soldier.

08:34.726 --> 08:35.828
Sergeant, I want you to arrange...

08:35.859 --> 08:38.155
for the immediate transfer of
this baby out of my regiment.

08:38.823 --> 08:41.294
I won't have other
brave men contaminated by him.

08:41.494 --> 08:43.510
- Yes sir.
- Carry on Sergeant.

08:47.180 --> 08:50.251
You were right sir, this sort of
thing can spread if isn't checked.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.431
You know General,
I'm convinced that these tours of yours...

08:53.461 --> 08:55.594
have an incalculable effect
upon the morale of these men.

08:56.015 --> 08:58.879
In fact, I think the fighting
spirit of the 701st derives from it.

08:59.057 --> 09:01.950
No, no Major,
that spirit was just born in them.

09:08.395 --> 09:09.629
The general is coming sir.

09:25.169 --> 09:28.240
- Always a pleasure to see you Colonel.
- I'm honored General.

09:28.270 --> 09:29.879
It's our privilege entirely.

09:30.353 --> 09:33.175
Well, quite a neat little spot you have here.

09:33.590 --> 09:36.541
I reserve comment on
the neatness sir, but it is little.

09:37.235 --> 09:39.484
Pretty shy on seating accommodations though.

09:39.514 --> 09:42.538
More than enough for me.
I never got the habit of sitting.

09:42.876 --> 09:45.556
- Like to be on my feet.
- Keep on the move.

09:45.674 --> 09:47.221
I can vouch for that Colonel.

09:47.381 --> 09:50.775
I can hardly get the general behind
a desk long enough to sign an order.

09:50.781 --> 09:52.727
Well, that's the way I am, you know Dax.

09:52.957 --> 09:55.738
I can't understand these armchair officers.

09:55.872 --> 09:57.978
Fellows trying to
fight a war from behind a desk.

09:58.245 --> 09:59.936
Waving papers at the enemy.

10:00.092 --> 10:03.156
Worrying about whether a mouse
is going to run up their pants leg.

10:03.252 --> 10:06.473
I don't know, General. If I had the
choice between mice and Mausers.

10:06.659 --> 10:09.811
- I think I'd take the mice every time.
- You never make me believe that Colonel.

10:10.130 --> 10:12.725
Seriously though, if a man's a ninny...

10:12.844 --> 10:15.121
let him put on a dress
and hide under the bed.

10:15.388 --> 10:18.089
But if he wants to be a soldier,
then, by heavens, he's got to be one.

10:18.341 --> 10:22.182
He's got to fight and he can't do that
unless he's where the fighting is.

10:22.740 --> 10:23.779
That's my credo.

10:23.809 --> 10:27.026
I think I have to agree with you,
presenting your case so convincingly sir.

10:27.499 --> 10:28.807
And you've never failed to live up to it sir.

10:29.012 --> 10:30.735
I imagine you'd like a
look around, wouldn't you?

10:30.765 --> 10:34.037
- Yes Colonel.
- Well, here's something to see.

10:34.404 --> 10:37.686
The Anthill, about as good a view as
you can get without actually being there.

10:38.577 --> 10:40.036
Well, that won't be long now, will it?

10:45.843 --> 10:47.529
Ah, yeah.

10:48.893 --> 10:51.410
Well, I've seen
much more formidable objectives.

10:52.556 --> 10:53.594
Much, much worse.

11:00.583 --> 11:05.265
Not something we can grab
and run away with but certainly pregnable.

11:05.769 --> 11:08.406
- Sounds kind of odd though, doesn't it?
- Why?

11:08.565 --> 11:10.897
Well, like something to do with giving birth.

11:10.927 --> 11:15.751
Oh yes. Quite. You're right on your toes this
morning Colonel, even sharper than usual.

11:16.099 --> 11:20.111
But we mustn't forget the colonel was perhaps
the foremost criminal lawyer in all France.

11:20.141 --> 11:23.169
- Of course General.
- Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

11:24.607 --> 11:27.532
Tell me Colonel, how did
your relief come off last night?

11:27.562 --> 11:32.271
- We drew some artillery, 29 casualties sir.
- Yes, I noticed it on the road in.

11:32.444 --> 11:34.733
Utterly inexcusable, stupid.

11:34.763 --> 11:37.920
All swarmed together like a bunch of
flies, just waiting for someone to swat them.

11:37.950 --> 11:39.638
Well, they never learn, it seems.

11:39.668 --> 11:43.305
They get in a tight spot under
heavy fire, gang up every time.

11:43.464 --> 11:46.463
Herd instinct, I suppose.
Kind of a lower animal sort of thing.

11:46.493 --> 11:48.847
Kind of a human sort of thing,
it seems to me or don't you make a...

11:48.854 --> 11:50.331
distinction between the two Major?

11:50.361 --> 11:54.239
Oh yes, very regrettable,
of course, very. Yes indeed.

11:54.558 --> 11:56.850
Major, would you be kind enough
to excuse us for a few minutes?

11:57.793 --> 11:59.640
Yes sir, of course.

12:00.902 --> 12:01.874
Colonel...

12:07.059 --> 12:09.225
Well Colonel, what do you think of it?

12:09.678 --> 12:11.918
- What I think of what sir?
- The Anthill.

12:12.721 --> 12:15.740
Colonel, your regiment
is going to take the Anthill tomorrow.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.474
You know the condition of my men sir.

12:19.504 --> 12:22.581
Naturally men are going to have to
be killed, possibly a lot of them.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.584
They absorb bullets and shrapnel...

12:24.940 --> 12:27.321
and by doing so make it
possible for others to get through.

12:27.351 --> 12:29.850
- What support will we have?
- Have none to give you.

12:31.764 --> 12:34.464
What sort of casualties
do you anticipate sir?

12:34.868 --> 12:38.759
Say, five percent killed by our own
barrage. It's a very generous allowance.

12:39.378 --> 12:41.540
Ten percent more
in getting through no man's-land.

12:41.785 --> 12:43.757
And 30% more getting through the wire.

12:44.047 --> 12:47.206
That leaves 65%
with the worst part of the job over.

12:48.051 --> 12:51.931
Let's say another 25%
in actually taking the Anthill.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.635
We still left with a force
more than adequate to hold it.

12:55.303 --> 12:57.995
General, you saying that more
than half of my men will be killed.

12:58.188 --> 13:03.167
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay
Colonel, but we will have the Anthill.

13:04.013 --> 13:06.779
- But will we sir?
- I'm depending on you Colonel.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.131
All France is depending on you.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.222
Am I amusing you Colonel?

13:16.455 --> 13:19.717
I'm not a bull General, I don't need a flag
waved in front of me to get me to charge.

13:19.747 --> 13:22.929
I don't think I like your comparison of
the flag of France to a bullfighter's cape.

13:22.959 --> 13:25.061
Meant nothing
disrespectful to the flag of France sir.

13:25.091 --> 13:28.545
Patriotism may be old fashioned, but show me
a patriot and I'll show you an honest man.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.283
Not everyone is always thought so.

13:30.313 --> 13:32.560
Samuel Johnson
had something else to say about patriots.

13:32.590 --> 13:34.088
And what was that, may I ask?

13:35.712 --> 13:37.922
- Nothing really.
- What you mean nothing really?

13:38.026 --> 13:39.539
Well sir, nothing really important.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.729
Colonel, when I ask a question, it's always
important. Now, who was this man?

13:43.464 --> 13:44.072
Samuel Johnson.

13:44.102 --> 13:46.305
All right now, what did he
have to say about patriotism?

13:46.957 --> 13:51.334
He said it was the last refuge of a
scoundrel sir. Sorry, meant nothing personal.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.310
You're tired Dax, you're very tired.

13:55.666 --> 13:59.056
It's you who are exhausted,
not your men and it's my fault.

13:59.249 --> 14:01.697
I've given you
one impossible task after another.

14:01.846 --> 14:02.505
You need rest...

14:02.535 --> 14:05.087
- you need it badly and never would either.
- I haven't said anything about rest sir.

14:05.257 --> 14:07.104
Therefore, you not going to
have any say so about it Colonel.

14:07.528 --> 14:10.153
As from right now, I'm
ordering you on indefinite furlough.

14:10.287 --> 14:11.789
General, you can't
take me away from my men...

14:11.819 --> 14:14.663
- you can't do that to me sir.
- Not to you Dax, for you.

14:15.064 --> 14:18.219
- For your good and for the good of your men.
- The good of my men sir?

14:18.635 --> 14:21.844
If a commanding officer lacks
confidence, what can we expect of his men?

14:22.536 --> 14:26.296
Naturally, I don't want to relieve you
but I must've your enthusiastic support.

14:26.793 --> 14:29.501
Not once have you said
that your men can take the Anthill.

14:32.149 --> 14:34.434
We'll take the Anthill.

14:35.947 --> 14:38.143
If any soldiers in the world can take it...

14:39.558 --> 14:41.672
we'll take the Anthill.

14:41.858 --> 14:45.270
And when you do, your men will
be relieved and get a long rest.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.247
Corporal Paris and
Private Lejeune reporting sir.

15:04.264 --> 15:05.688
You took your time about it.

15:05.827 --> 15:09.356
We prepared as quick as we
could sir, we had to alert the sentries.

15:09.623 --> 15:11.129
All right. You men, at ease.

15:11.641 --> 15:14.267
This is a reconnaissance
patrol, German wire,

15:14.268 --> 15:16.836
machine gun posts,
identification of bodies.

15:17.274 --> 15:20.486
There will only be the three of us,
and we're to avoid a fight if we can.

15:22.688 --> 15:26.173
We go out to the left and we
come back through Post 6 on the right.

15:26.507 --> 15:27.957
Is everything all clear at Post 6?

15:28.195 --> 15:30.019
All the sentries have been warned up to here.

15:30.049 --> 15:33.268
Number 6 will send up flares
at 10 minute intervals starting at 0400.

15:33.365 --> 15:36.139
- I wanted them every five minutes.
- I told them that sir.

15:36.309 --> 15:39.811
The sergeant says every five minutes is too
much, he says it's certain to draw artillery.

15:39.841 --> 15:42.104
Quite a strategist
this sergeant, what's his name?

15:42.222 --> 15:43.224
I don't know sir.

15:45.818 --> 15:48.963
All right. You men wait
outside, I'll join you in a minute.

15:48.993 --> 15:51.931
- Would you mind telling us the password sir?
- Calais.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.181
Yes sir.

16:02.097 --> 16:05.450
- He's fortifying himself.
- Smell like heaven.

16:05.628 --> 16:08.094
I can always tell when
he's had a few, he gets sarcastic.

16:08.628 --> 16:11.068
Well, at least he could've
passed it around, the pig.

16:11.699 --> 16:13.828
Hey, what's he got against you anyway?

16:14.939 --> 16:17.001
We went to school together before the war.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.799
He thinks I don't have enough
respect for him, he's right.

16:22.711 --> 16:24.083
If you gentlemen are ready.

16:30.002 --> 16:32.212
- Colonel.
- Everything clear and understood?

16:32.338 --> 16:33.265
Yes sir.

16:33.762 --> 16:36.173
The lane through our wire
is right out in front here.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.946
Machine guns are pointing at the opening.

16:38.794 --> 16:40.191
- Good luck men.
- Thank you sir.

16:40.841 --> 16:41.790
All right men, let's go.

18:38.213 --> 18:40.601
- What's that?
- I don't know.

18:41.817 --> 18:45.943
Lejeune, move out and
look that over, we'll cover you.

18:46.565 --> 18:50.763
- Split up a night patrol?
- Move out Lejeune.

20:15.680 --> 20:19.516
- Don't like this, let's get out of here.
- We haven't given him enough time.

20:25.505 --> 20:28.979
- We wait any longer, they'll get us too.
- We got to wait for him.

20:33.814 --> 20:36.405
He must be dead, where is he?

20:40.622 --> 20:42.474
Roget.

21:34.533 --> 21:37.703
- Well?
- Surprised Lieutenant?

21:37.733 --> 21:41.032
Yes I am, happily surprised.
I thought you'd been killed.

21:41.062 --> 21:43.989
You didn't wait around to
find out, did you Lieutenant?

21:44.438 --> 21:45.829
Now, look here. What do you mean?

21:45.930 --> 21:49.209
I mean you ran like a
rabbit after you killed Lejeune.

21:49.239 --> 21:51.975
Killed Lejeune? What are you talking about?

21:52.887 --> 21:55.015
I don't think I like your tone.

21:55.305 --> 21:57.635
You're speaking to an officer, remember that.

21:58.141 --> 22:03.020
Oh well, I must be mistaken then sir.
An officer wouldn't do that.

22:03.642 --> 22:07.859
A man wouldn't do it, only a thing would.

22:08.192 --> 22:14.420
A sneaky, booze guzzling, yellow bellied
rat, with a bottle for a brain and streak...

22:14.450 --> 22:16.571
- of spit where his spine ought to be.
- That's enough Corporal.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.494
You've got yourself into a mess Lieutenant.

22:18.524 --> 22:21.500
Oh, I have, have I?
Well, you got yourself in a worse one.

22:21.613 --> 22:26.435
First, general insubordination.
Second, threatening your superior officer.

22:26.609 --> 22:30.742
Third, refusing to obey an order
and inciting others to do the same.

22:30.916 --> 22:33.490
Now, how do you think those
charges are going to look on paper?

22:33.520 --> 22:35.374
Not half as bad as these.

22:35.802 --> 22:40.272
Endangering the lives of your men
through recklessness, drunk on duty.

22:40.423 --> 22:45.425
Wanton murder of one of your own men
and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

22:47.361 --> 22:52.312
Philippe, have you ever tried to
bring charges against an officer?

22:52.660 --> 22:54.848
It's my word against yours, you know?

22:54.849 --> 22:57.249
And whose
word you think they're going to believe?

22:57.509 --> 23:02.213
Or let, let me put it another way, whose
word you think they're going to accept?

23:02.662 --> 23:04.654
Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

23:05.151 --> 23:09.058
So far, all I have written
in this report is that you...

23:09.088 --> 23:11.694
and Lejeune were killed while out on patrol.

23:12.012 --> 23:14.054
I'll fix this to read
that you made your way...

23:14.084 --> 23:16.486
back after becoming
separated during the skirmish.

23:16.688 --> 23:19.263
- That'll end the matter once and for all.
- You killed Lejeune you now that, don't you?

23:19.264 --> 23:21.092
- I'm sorry, it was an accident.
- You threw the grenade that killed him.

23:21.107 --> 23:24.171
I'd give anything in the world if it hadn't
have happened and that's the truth.

23:24.980 --> 23:29.186
Honestly, I know you don't like me,
but what kind of a man do you think I am?

23:30.975 --> 23:33.349
- Oh, good morning Colonel.
- At ease men.

23:33.729 --> 23:35.396
I've been waiting for your report Lieutenant.

23:35.426 --> 23:38.392
- Well, I think we found out a thing or two.
- Everything go well?

23:38.837 --> 23:41.986
- No sir, Private Lejeune was killed.
- How it happen?

23:42.100 --> 23:44.175
- It's all right here in the report sir.
- Well, let's have it.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.078
Oh, it isn't quite finished yet sir.

23:46.754 --> 23:48.877
That's all Corporal,
you did a good night's work.

23:48.907 --> 23:51.622
Should feel very proud
of yourself, go get some sleep.

23:52.707 --> 23:53.310
Yes sir.

23:57.965 --> 24:01.089
- How do you lose Lejeune?
- Machine gun fire sir.

24:01.423 --> 24:03.917
He coughed, almost got us all killed.

24:05.493 --> 24:07.764
Finish the report
and get it to my dugout immediately.

24:07.885 --> 24:08.719
Yes sir.

24:14.424 --> 24:17.359
The artillery starts at 0515.

24:18.114 --> 24:21.304
First Battalion will move out at 0530.

24:22.203 --> 24:24.595
When the leading elements
have cleared the German wire...

24:24.625 --> 24:27.439
the second wave, consisting of
the Second and Third Battalions...

24:27.469 --> 24:30.083
minus two companies in reserve ill move out.

24:30.843 --> 24:33.411
In no case later than 0540.

24:34.885 --> 24:37.509
Well, that's it gentlemen,
are there any questions?

24:37.750 --> 24:42.145
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery
preparation all that we can expect?

24:42.627 --> 24:46.572
The feeling is that any more than that will
give them too much time to get organized.

24:46.962 --> 24:49.159
What's weather
supposed to be like tomorrow sir?

24:50.244 --> 24:51.097
Too good.

24:52.423 --> 24:57.438
- No chance of rain or fog?
- Forecast is for sun all day.

24:58.153 --> 25:02.053
If, perhaps I should say
when we take the Anthill...

25:02.083 --> 25:05.456
how long do we have to hold it
before we can expect any support?

25:05.963 --> 25:09.798
Well, General Mireau, who by the way,
will be personally observing the attack is...

25:09.828 --> 25:13.144
promised us support from the
73th by sundown tomorrow which...

25:13.302 --> 25:16.125
means, of course,
that we'll have to hold all day.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.367
Are there any more questions?

25:23.015 --> 25:27.097
Well gentlemen, good luck and I'm sure
you'll come through as you always do.

25:27.358 --> 25:28.472
Let's get some sleep.

25:31.092 --> 25:33.799
I'm not afraid
of dying tomorrow, only of getting killed.

25:33.829 --> 25:35.752
- That's as clear as mud.
- What?

25:35.782 --> 25:38.749
Which would you rather be done in by,
a bayonet or a machine gun?

25:38.779 --> 25:41.659
- Oh, a machine gun, naturally.
- Naturally, that's just my point.

25:41.689 --> 25:43.946
They're both pieces of
steel ripping into your guts.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.926
Only the machine gun is quicker,
cleaner and less painful, isn't it?

25:46.956 --> 25:47.779
What is that prove?

25:47.809 --> 25:50.601
It proves that most of us are more afraid
of getting hurt than of getting killed.

25:51.971 --> 25:52.730
Look at Bernard.

25:53.014 --> 25:56.097
He panics when it comes to gas,
but gas doesn't bother me a bit.

25:56.369 --> 25:59.520
He's seen photos of gas cases.
Doesn't mean anything to me.

26:00.048 --> 26:01.145
But I'll tell you something though.

26:01.264 --> 26:03.161
I'd hate like the devil
to be without my tin hat.

26:03.428 --> 26:06.102
But on the other hand, I don't mind
not having a tin hat for my tail.

26:06.244 --> 26:07.699
- Why is that?
- You ought to, because...

26:07.729 --> 26:09.180
- Because I know a wound to the head...
- That's where your brains are.

26:09.210 --> 26:10.739
Will hurt much more than one in the tail.

26:11.048 --> 26:13.977
The tail is just meat but the
head. Ah, the head is all bone.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.125
- Ah, speak for yourself.
- Tell me this.

26:16.570 --> 26:18.965
Aside from the bayonet,
what are you most afraid of?

26:18.995 --> 26:21.438
- High explosives.
- Exactly, it's the same with me.

26:21.468 --> 26:24.361
Because, because I know that it can
chew you up worse than anything else.

26:24.557 --> 26:27.174
Look, it's just like I'm trying to tell
you, if you're really afraid of dying...

26:27.204 --> 26:29.463
you'd be living in a funk
all the rest of your life because you...

26:29.493 --> 26:31.337
know you got to go someday, any day.

26:31.521 --> 26:34.047
And besides, if it's death
that you're really afraid of...

26:34.160 --> 26:35.988
why should you care
about what it is that kills you?

26:36.071 --> 26:40.848
Ah, you're too smart for me Professor,
all I know is nobody wants to die.

26:50.299 --> 26:52.499
Through to Division sir, through to Polygon.

26:53.010 --> 26:56.135
Everything quiet, all
units report themselves ready.

26:56.562 --> 26:57.640
Zero minus two.

26:59.264 --> 27:00.823
May I offer you gentlemen some cognac?

27:00.853 --> 27:02.294
- Thank you General.
- Thank you sir.

27:06.521 --> 27:07.457
After you sir.

27:10.131 --> 27:11.305
To France.

28:52.817 --> 28:57.220
Minus 15, 14, 13...

28:59.302 --> 28:59.846
ten...

29:00.436 --> 29:06.132
nine, eight, seven, six, five, four...

29:06.487 --> 29:10.663
three, two, one, zero.

32:07.824 --> 32:11.178
- Sergeant, where's B Company?
- Don't know sir.

32:16.326 --> 32:17.928
Where in heaven's name are they?

32:17.958 --> 32:19.540
- On the left sir.
- Where are the rest?

32:20.087 --> 32:22.697
Zero plus one and they're still
in the trenches, they're not advancing.

32:22.727 --> 32:25.773
- Yes sir.
- Miserable cowards, they're not advancing.

32:25.803 --> 32:28.848
The barrage is getting away
from them, they're still in the trenches.

32:28.878 --> 32:29.805
Yes sir.

32:32.510 --> 32:34.854
- Captain Nichols.
- Yes sir?

32:35.901 --> 32:38.791
Order the 75 to commence
firing on our own positions.

32:40.134 --> 32:43.450
Captain, do you fail to
comprehend the meaning of my order?

32:44.529 --> 32:47.379
No sir, but I respectfully ask to...

32:47.384 --> 32:50.432
Captain, do you fail to
comprehend the meaning of my order?

32:50.711 --> 32:53.165
- No sir.
- Then, carry it out Captain.

32:53.793 --> 32:54.505
Yes sir.

32:59.762 --> 33:02.296
Hello Polygon, this is Division.

33:04.445 --> 33:06.622
Batteries 1 and 2 commence firing...

33:07.542 --> 33:12.426
on coordinates 32-58-78.

33:12.610 --> 33:18.671
Batteries 1 and 2 to
commence firing on coordinates 32-58...

33:19.077 --> 33:21.090
78, over.

33:28.479 --> 33:31.840
General, the battery commander
reports those are our own positions.

33:32.159 --> 33:35.100
- He says it must be a mistake.
- Confirm the order Captain.

33:35.288 --> 33:38.649
Yes sir, there is no mistake.
The order is confirmed.

33:38.823 --> 33:42.878
Battery commander respectfully reports
he cannot execute such an order...

33:42.908 --> 33:47.066
unless it is in writing
and signed by the general, over.

33:47.356 --> 33:51.020
General, battery commander respectfully
reports he cannot execute such an order...

33:51.050 --> 33:52.962
unless it is in writing
and signed by the general.

33:52.992 --> 33:54.937
- Give me that phone.
- Yes sir.

33:59.960 --> 34:03.233
- General Mireau speaking.
- Battery commander speaking sir.

34:03.263 --> 34:05.165
The troops are
mutinying, refusing to advance.

34:05.166 --> 34:07.366
Fire as ordered until further notice.

34:07.595 --> 34:11.534
With all respect sir, you have no right
to order me to shoot down my own men...

34:11.565 --> 34:15.143
unless you are willing to take full
and undivided responsibility for it.

34:15.172 --> 34:17.603
Captain Rousseau,
are you going to obey my order?

34:17.634 --> 34:21.152
I must've a written order
before I can execute such a command sir.

34:21.183 --> 34:23.833
Supposing you're
killed, then where will I be?

34:23.864 --> 34:27.239
You'll be in front of a firing squad
tomorrow morning, that's where you'll be.

34:27.413 --> 34:30.745
Hand over your command and report
yourself under arrest to my headquarters.

34:42.799 --> 34:44.596
Roget.

34:45.889 --> 34:47.846
Lieutenant Roget,
why are your men still in here?

34:47.847 --> 34:50.116
Impossible sir, major Vignon is dead.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.853
Get these men out of the trenches, come on.

34:53.317 --> 34:57.118
Let's get ready for another try,
get these men out of here.

34:57.148 --> 34:59.212
I've tried three times,
look at all the casualties.

34:59.242 --> 35:04.768
All right, let's give it another try.
Come on, let's give it another try.

35:15.463 --> 35:18.743
It's impossible sir,
all the men are falling back.

35:19.996 --> 35:23.984
Sir, I respectfully submit to the colonel.

35:24.014 --> 35:28.804
I beg you pardon, your remarks
to me were very unfair sir.

35:29.280 --> 35:33.189
It's just impossible, it's just impossible.

35:33.219 --> 35:36.754
General, according to first reports,
the attack has failed all along the line.

35:36.881 --> 35:38.747
Men are falling back to our own trenches.

35:39.402 --> 35:44.142
Major Saint Auban, arrange for
the immediate relief of the 701st Regiment.

35:44.409 --> 35:48.524
Have them sent to the Chateau d'Aigle.
Have Colonel Dax report to my headquarters.

35:48.554 --> 35:51.507
Major Couderc, assemble
a general court martial.

35:51.537 --> 35:54.040
Have it ready to meet
at 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

35:54.228 --> 35:58.079
If those little sweethearts won't face
German bullets, they'll face French ones.

36:09.187 --> 36:12.849
I ordered an attack.
Your troops refused to attack.

36:13.007 --> 36:15.597
Our troops did attack sir,
but they could make no headway.

36:15.627 --> 36:18.276
Because they didn't
try Colonel, I saw it myself.

36:18.508 --> 36:20.287
Half of your men never left the trenches.

36:20.317 --> 36:23.283
Third of my men were pinned down
because the fire was so intense.

36:23.313 --> 36:25.266
Don't quibble over fractions Colonel.

36:25.296 --> 36:28.626
The fact remains that a good part of
your men never left their own trenches.

36:29.580 --> 36:33.604
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have 10 men
from each company in your regiment...

36:33.634 --> 36:35.719
tried under penalty of death for cowardice.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.903
- Penalty of death?
- For cowardice.

36:39.063 --> 36:41.364
They have skimmed milk
in their veins instead of blood.

36:41.394 --> 36:43.898
Then it's the reddest milk I've
ever seen, my trenches are soaked...

36:43.928 --> 36:45.305
- with that red skimmed milk.
- That's just about enough out of you Col..

36:45.335 --> 36:46.242
I'm not going to mince words with...

36:46.272 --> 36:47.980
- stand on protocol.
- Colonel Dax, if you continue in this...

36:48.010 --> 36:49.970
manner, I shall have
to place you under arrest.

36:50.108 --> 36:53.558
I believe the colonel has a point,
even though he makes it rather bluntly.

36:53.902 --> 36:56.575
This is not a trial,
but it does bear certain aspects of one.

36:56.605 --> 36:59.410
And Colonel Dax, technically,
is cast in the role of the defense.

37:00.103 --> 37:02.384
In view of the gravity of
the charges a court of law would...

37:02.414 --> 37:04.558
grant him all possible
latitude in presenting his case.

37:04.672 --> 37:08.076
Latitude is one
thing, insubordination another.

37:08.219 --> 37:12.057
I am merely offering an opinion General.
Please do not feel constrained to accept it.

37:12.988 --> 37:15.475
I am perfectly willing
to accept it General Broulard.

37:16.424 --> 37:19.550
I'm sorry sir, I certainly didn't
intend to be insubordinate.

37:20.150 --> 37:23.513
My only aim is to remind you of the
heroism these men have shown on...

37:23.543 --> 37:25.220
every occasion in the past.

37:25.250 --> 37:28.294
We're not talking about the past.
We're talking about the present.

37:28.401 --> 37:30.421
But don't you see sir? They're not cowards.

37:30.451 --> 37:34.038
So if some of them didn't leave the trenches,
it must've been because it was impossible.

37:34.145 --> 37:37.826
They were ordered to attack,
it was their duty to obey that order.

37:38.696 --> 37:41.864
We can't leave it up to the men
to decide when an order is possible or not.

37:42.428 --> 37:43.710
If was impossible...

37:43.865 --> 37:47.211
the only proof of that would be their dead
bodies lying at the bottom of the trenches.

37:48.386 --> 37:49.424
They're scum Colonel.

37:50.118 --> 37:51.572
The whole rotten regiment.

37:52.136 --> 37:55.002
A pack of sneaking,
whining, tail dragging curs.

37:55.340 --> 37:59.469
- Do you really believe that sir?
- Yes, I do, that's exactly what I believe.

37:59.888 --> 38:02.426
And what's more, it's an incontestable fact.

38:02.897 --> 38:04.808
Then why not shoot the entire regiment?

38:05.402 --> 38:07.161
- I'm perfectly serious.
- Oh no Colonel...

38:07.343 --> 38:08.980
you're missing the point entirely.

38:09.135 --> 38:12.825
We don't want to slaughter the French
army, all we want to do is to set an example.

38:12.855 --> 38:15.202
Oh well, if it's an example
you want, then take me.

38:15.320 --> 38:17.528
- Take you?
- Yes sir, if an example you want, one...

38:17.558 --> 38:19.197
man will do as well as a hundred.

38:19.465 --> 38:23.672
The logical choice is the officer
most responsible for the attack.

38:25.326 --> 38:28.613
Come on Colonel, I think you're overwrought.
This is not a question of officers.

38:29.892 --> 38:30.626
Paul...

38:31.646 --> 38:34.885
we don't want to overdo this thing.
Suppose we just make it a dozen.

38:35.942 --> 38:38.975
I was talking of a hundred
men and now we're down to 12.

38:39.005 --> 38:41.474
Paul, let's not haggle
over this thing anymore.

38:41.699 --> 38:44.417
Let's get it settled once and for
all so that we can all live with it.

38:46.499 --> 38:50.789
Well, perhaps I was a bit too
anxious to see proper justice meted out.

38:51.727 --> 38:55.685
I spent my entire life in the army, I've
always tried to be true to my principles.

38:56.362 --> 38:58.855
That's the only mistake
I can ever be accused of.

39:00.367 --> 39:01.906
I'll settle for this.

39:02.491 --> 39:03.827
Have the company commanders...

39:03.910 --> 39:07.993
select one man from each
company in the first wave, three in all.

39:08.159 --> 39:10.386
Well, that's very reasonable of you Paul.

39:10.607 --> 39:14.088
The court-martial will meet
at the chateau at 3 o'clock this afternoon.

39:14.118 --> 39:16.957
- Will that be convenient for you General?
- Oh, I won't be there Paul.

39:17.305 --> 39:18.388
You won't be there?

39:18.418 --> 39:20.898
No, I think it best that you
handle this matter on your own.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.432
- Probably so.
- General Mireau...

39:24.560 --> 39:28.737
if it's at all possible, I'd like to be
appointed counsel for the accused.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.476
I'll take the matter into consideration.

39:30.506 --> 39:33.628
Oh, we can permit that, can't we Paul? Of
course we can, consider it settled Colonel.

39:33.658 --> 39:35.203
- Thank you sir.
- Well...

39:37.464 --> 39:40.338
Noon straight up Paul,
hope that you can stay for lunch Colonel.

39:40.368 --> 39:42.412
George, I'm afraid
the colonel won't have time.

39:43.305 --> 39:46.202
Don't deny it Paul,
you've been hiding this man.

39:46.388 --> 39:48.861
Keeping him for your own,
I think that was very selfish of you.

39:48.891 --> 39:50.783
Thank you for your
courtesy General, but I'm afraid...

39:50.813 --> 39:53.106
there isn't much time
between now and 3 o'clock.

39:53.136 --> 39:56.276
Of course Colonel, I shall look forward
to the pleasure of seeing you again.

40:17.009 --> 40:19.842
- Yes Captain, what is it?
- You ordered me to report to you here sir.

40:19.872 --> 40:22.572
- Captain Rousseau, battery commander sir.
- Yes, yes, of course.

40:23.047 --> 40:26.240
I wanted to speak to you
about some of your shells falling short.

40:26.785 --> 40:28.732
I haven't time to go into it now.

40:29.233 --> 40:31.289
Report back to your
command until further orders.

40:31.319 --> 40:32.747
Yes sir.

40:35.110 --> 40:38.161
- Bad stuff, demoralizes the men.
- I quite agree with you.

40:38.448 --> 40:40.834
And the best solution
is to shelve him to another outfit.

40:41.112 --> 40:43.094
A court of inquiry
ought to roast him a bit first.

40:43.124 --> 40:47.741
Well, in cases like this, shells falling
short, I, I always try to avoid an inquiry.

40:47.898 --> 40:50.243
It gets around among the men
and makes a bad impression.

40:51.207 --> 40:53.671
No, shelving will be the best
discipline for him in my opinion.

40:53.701 --> 40:56.946
- Well, perhaps you're right.
- Oh, would you excuse me for a moment?

40:57.113 --> 40:58.844
A regimental matter
I want to mention to the colonel.

40:58.874 --> 41:01.230
- I'll join you in the dining room.
- Splendid, in a moment.

41:03.055 --> 41:05.871
That will be Captain Sancy,
Captain Renouart and Lieutenant Roget.

41:05.901 --> 41:06.539
Yes sir.

41:06.569 --> 41:08.708
Have them meet me at regimental
headquarters in half an hour.

41:08.988 --> 41:10.284
- Yes sir.
- Colonel Dax.

41:11.927 --> 41:14.486
- Yes sir.
- I'd like a word with you.

41:14.764 --> 41:15.645
Certainly sir.

41:17.137 --> 41:20.827
- Let's be sensible about this.
- Sensible sir?

41:22.284 --> 41:26.233
Listen to me Dax, drop this
fancy talk with me, understand?

41:26.845 --> 41:30.266
General Broulard seems
to think you're funny. I don't.

41:30.739 --> 41:34.160
- Now, I want you to drop this affair.
- I beg your pardon sir, is that an order?

41:35.044 --> 41:38.576
Colonel Dax, when this mess
is cleaned up, I'll break you.

41:39.021 --> 41:42.081
I'll find an excuse and I'll
break you to the ranks, I'll ruin you.

41:42.378 --> 41:43.722
And it'll be just what you deserve.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.828
Showing such little
loyalty to your commanding officer.

41:47.539 --> 41:48.735
That's all Colonel.

42:10.788 --> 42:12.438
Detail, halt.

42:12.563 --> 42:15.639
General Mireau feels that the attack
on the Anthill yesterday morning...

42:15.669 --> 42:18.690
failed because of an inadequate
effort on the part of the First Battalion.

42:19.327 --> 42:21.782
Each of you is to select
one man from your company...

42:21.812 --> 42:25.722
place him under arrest and have him ready
to appear before a general court-martial...

42:25.752 --> 42:28.243
no later than 1500 hours this afternoon.

42:28.273 --> 42:30.598
The charge is cowardice
in the face of the enemy.

42:30.628 --> 42:33.966
You have your orders
gentlemen, let's carry them out.

42:54.252 --> 42:56.521
But Lieutenant Roget killed
Lejeune on that patrol. And then..

42:56.551 --> 42:58.664
Blackmailed me into keeping
quiet about the whole thing.

42:58.694 --> 43:01.278
- That's why he picked me.
- Corporal, I understand your feelings.

43:01.308 --> 43:03.967
But that story has nothing to do
with the charges you're being tried for.

43:03.997 --> 43:06.538
- Don't you believe me sir?
- Yes, I do.

43:07.020 --> 43:09.523
But who else will? You got no witnesses.

43:10.692 --> 43:14.075
Besides, such charges against an
officer would only antagonize the court.

43:14.579 --> 43:18.176
When we get clear of this, I'm going
into the story of that patrol again.

43:18.287 --> 43:21.499
Sir, in my case Captain Renouart
had the sergeant draw lots.

43:22.199 --> 43:23.932
I was picked purely by chance.

43:24.591 --> 43:26.566
You're lucky, look at me.

43:26.973 --> 43:31.402
I was just picked because Captain
Sancy said I was a social undesirable.

43:31.514 --> 43:34.997
- Me, a social undesirable Colonel.
- I didn't act like a coward.

43:35.027 --> 43:36.603
- Picking by lots, is that fair?
- Neither did I Major Vignon.

43:36.633 --> 43:40.609
Gentlemen, you all got to understand that
the reason you were picked is immaterial.

43:40.639 --> 43:44.429
Whatever the reason,
you're on trial for your lives.

43:48.238 --> 43:52.132
Stick to the stories you've told me and don't
let the prosecutor shake you out of them.

43:53.309 --> 43:56.905
Now remember, you'll be soldiers
in the presence of superior officers.

43:56.935 --> 43:59.837
So act like what you are. Soldiers.

44:00.569 --> 44:01.988
And brave ones at that.

44:03.221 --> 44:05.184
Now, I've been in the room
you'll be sitting in.

44:05.214 --> 44:07.411
The afternoon sun
will be in your faces, so...

44:07.441 --> 44:11.009
don't let it seem as if you're
dropping your eyes in a hangdog manner.

44:12.336 --> 44:14.885
When you answer questions,
look the judges in the eye.

44:14.915 --> 44:17.804
Don't whine, plead or
make speeches, that's my job.

44:17.834 --> 44:19.446
Simple statements, short...

44:19.817 --> 44:21.920
but make them so they
can be heard all over the room.

44:21.950 --> 44:25.325
And try not to repeat yourselves.
I'll do that for you when I sum up.

44:26.039 --> 44:26.966
Now, we haven't much time.

44:26.976 --> 44:29.886
The court-martial begins in about an hour,
and I've got notes to look at.

44:32.329 --> 44:32.937
Good luck.

44:34.702 --> 44:36.660
- Thank you sir.
- Colonel sir.

44:44.792 --> 44:46.706
On the left, ho.

44:50.347 --> 44:51.556
Detail, halt.

44:52.892 --> 44:55.139
Prisoners, right face.

44:56.103 --> 44:58.328
On the left, ho.

45:05.016 --> 45:06.959
On the left, ho.

45:11.137 --> 45:13.340
Left face.

45:17.762 --> 45:20.076
Court-martial is open, prisoners may be seat.

45:27.264 --> 45:28.963
This is a general court-martial, we shall...

45:28.993 --> 45:31.270
therefore dispense
with unnecessary formalities.

45:32.670 --> 45:35.511
These men are charged
with cowardice in the face of the enemy...

45:36.260 --> 45:37.855
and will be tried for that offense.

45:39.293 --> 45:43.408
- Mr. Prosecutor.
- Call the accused, private Ferol.

45:43.438 --> 45:44.690
Mr. President...

45:45.617 --> 45:49.192
will the prosecutor question the witnesses
without even reading the indictment?

45:49.519 --> 45:52.570
Please don't take up the
court's time with technicalities.

45:53.169 --> 45:55.066
The indictment is lengthy,

45:55.288 --> 45:58.221
- and there's no point in reading it.
- Well, the defense has a right to know...

45:58.251 --> 46:00.839
- the exact accusations.
- The indictment is that the accused show...

46:00.869 --> 46:04.563
cowardice in the face of the
enemy during the attack on the Anthill.

46:04.874 --> 46:06.376
Proceed Mr.Prosecutor.

46:08.014 --> 46:10.559
Call the accused, private Ferol.

46:20.527 --> 46:22.560
- Private Ferol.
- Yes sir?

46:23.369 --> 46:26.074
Were you in the first wave
during the attack on the Anthill?

46:26.527 --> 46:27.491
Yes sir.

46:27.729 --> 46:31.141
- Did you refuse to advance?
- No sir.

46:31.794 --> 46:33.997
- Did you advance?
- Yes sir.

46:34.982 --> 46:36.235
How far did you advance?

46:36.650 --> 46:39.269
To about the middle of no man's land sir.

46:40.262 --> 46:41.605
Then what did you do?

46:42.434 --> 46:44.385
There were machine
gun bullets landing all around.

46:44.415 --> 46:46.543
Answer the question, what did you do?

46:47.612 --> 46:48.413
Well...

46:50.343 --> 46:53.376
- I saw that me and Meyer sir...
- I didn't ask you what you saw.

46:53.593 --> 46:57.717
The court has no concern
with your visual experiences.

46:57.747 --> 47:01.133
- My what sir?
- Prisoner will reply to the question.

47:01.163 --> 47:02.972
Yes sir, what question was it?

47:03.002 --> 47:06.303
You advanced to the middle of
no man's land, what did you do then?

47:06.867 --> 47:09.139
- Then sir?
- You go back or forward?

47:09.766 --> 47:13.858
- I went back sir.
- In other words private Ferrol...

47:15.146 --> 47:18.229
- you retreated,
- Yes sir.

47:19.731 --> 47:22.714
That's all.
The accused may return to his seat.

47:22.744 --> 47:24.118
Just a minute.

47:25.037 --> 47:28.800
Mr. President, I'd like
to question the witness if I may.

47:29.249 --> 47:31.706
- Proceed Colonel.
- Thank you.

47:32.767 --> 47:35.517
Now, Private Ferol, when you
reached the middle of no man's land...

47:35.547 --> 47:38.130
- you were alone with Private Meyer?
- Yes sir.

47:38.944 --> 47:42.646
- What happened to the rest of your company?
- Well, I don't know sir.

47:43.514 --> 47:45.758
I guess the rest of them
had been killed or wounded.

47:45.788 --> 47:49.645
And you found yourself in the middle
of no man's land alone with Private Meyer.

47:49.675 --> 47:50.437
Yes sir.

47:50.467 --> 47:52.696
Why didn't you
attack the Anthill single handed?

47:57.657 --> 48:02.835
- Why didn't you storm the Anthill alone?
- Just me and Meyer? You're kidding sir.

48:03.555 --> 48:07.636
Yes, I'm kidding,
private Ferol, thank you. That's all.

48:07.666 --> 48:10.199
I don't see the point
of this line of questioning.

48:10.619 --> 48:13.419
Well, I'm attempting
to indicate sir, the utter...

48:13.449 --> 48:16.314
absurdity of the line of
questioning used by the prosecutor.

48:17.622 --> 48:18.896
Mr. Prosecutor.

48:19.055 --> 48:23.340
So you freely admit
private Ferol, that you retreated.

48:23.629 --> 48:25.719
Yes sir, me and Meyer both.

48:26.246 --> 48:30.183
I knew we should've took
Anthill but we came on back.

48:32.247 --> 48:33.336
That's all.

48:36.054 --> 48:38.138
The accused may return to his seat.

48:48.860 --> 48:52.392
Private Arnaud, did you advance?

48:52.696 --> 48:56.402
Yes sir, until I was ordered
back to the trenches by Captain Renouart.

48:57.488 --> 49:00.904
- How far did you advance?
- Into the wire sir.

49:01.526 --> 49:06.998
- The enemy wire, I suppose.
- No sir, was our wire.

49:08.833 --> 49:14.287
You mean to tell me that you didn't
advance any further than our wire?

49:14.823 --> 49:15.731
No sir, I didn't.

49:17.400 --> 49:21.091
How far would you say that was?
How many meters?

49:21.785 --> 49:26.023
- Well, I advanced as far as I could.
- How many meters?

49:27.282 --> 49:31.393
- Not many.
- Not many?

49:34.853 --> 49:39.688
Now Private Arnaud,
before you were ordered back...

49:40.325 --> 49:42.829
did you urge your fellow soldiers forward?

49:44.335 --> 49:47.692
Most of them were dead or wounded before
they got three steps beyond the trenches.

49:47.722 --> 49:51.732
- Reply to the question.
- I didn't urge them on, no sir.

49:55.524 --> 49:56.480
Thank you.

50:03.260 --> 50:07.256
Private Arnaud, at ease please.

50:09.065 --> 50:13.435
Aside from your sad failure to
give throat to spirited battle cries...

50:13.465 --> 50:16.764
was your behavior different in any respect
from that of the other men in your company?

50:16.794 --> 50:21.369
- Objection, that's a matter of conjecture.
- Sustained.

50:24.640 --> 50:27.651
Did any men in your
company get beyond our wire?

50:27.911 --> 50:28.896
No sir.

50:29.373 --> 50:31.574
Is it true that you've been
designated a coward...

50:31.604 --> 50:34.497
simply and purely because
you drew a slip of paper marked I?

50:34.527 --> 50:37.147
- Yes sir.
- I don't see that that's significant.

50:37.407 --> 50:40.794
It's accepted practice in the
French army to pick examples by lot.

50:41.214 --> 50:43.891
And since this entire company
advanced only a few meters...

50:43.921 --> 50:46.360
picking by lot
was eminently fair in this case.

50:46.946 --> 50:49.971
Well, I'd like to point out that this
soldier has distinguished himself...

50:50.001 --> 50:52.317
in some of the bloodiest battles of the war.

50:53.402 --> 50:56.095
With the court's
permission I'll read citations for...

50:56.125 --> 50:58.946
bravery that he's
already earned on two occasions.

50:59.757 --> 51:03.381
First, citations in the
Orders in the Army for bravery...

51:03.411 --> 51:04.752
That's immaterial Colonel.

51:04.782 --> 51:08.865
The accused is not being tried for his
former bravery but for his recent cowardice.

51:09.154 --> 51:11.197
Medals are no defense.

51:13.876 --> 51:17.263
- May I call witnesses to his character?
- You may not.

51:18.407 --> 51:22.083
But you may call witnesses to the effect
that he reached the German wire.

51:23.696 --> 51:24.883
Mr. President...

51:24.913 --> 51:30.239
no one in the entire regiment got anywhere
near the German wire, including myself.

51:30.725 --> 51:34.408
Call the next accused,
if you're through Colonel.

51:35.537 --> 51:36.652
Thank you.

51:37.781 --> 51:39.333
Prisoner may return to his seat.

51:48.474 --> 51:50.790
So you never even left the trenches.

51:52.222 --> 51:55.653
- No sir.
- That's all.

51:56.131 --> 52:00.994
Corporal Paris,
why didn't you leave the trenches?

52:02.123 --> 52:06.277
Major Vignon was shot and fell back
on top of me sir and knocked me cold.

52:06.610 --> 52:10.114
And were you lying unconscious
in the trenches during the entire attack?

52:10.823 --> 52:14.428
- Yes sir.
- That's all.

52:14.703 --> 52:16.701
Have you any witnesses to that?

52:17.424 --> 52:20.161
No sir. I guess everybody
was too busy to notice me.

52:20.494 --> 52:22.664
And there were so
many others lying dead anyway.

52:22.694 --> 52:25.661
- But you have no witnesses.
- No sir.

52:26.675 --> 52:29.570
I only have a rather
large cut on my head sir.

52:29.830 --> 52:32.002
That could've been self-inflicted later.

52:33.537 --> 52:35.172
Thank you, you may stand down.

52:41.758 --> 52:44.638
Mr. Prosecutor, you can make your plea now.

52:49.473 --> 52:51.063
Gentlemen of the court...

52:52.556 --> 52:54.785
this case speaks for itself.

52:55.841 --> 52:59.258
All of us witnessed
the regrettable attack yesterday morning.

53:02.312 --> 53:05.496
And I submit that that attack...

53:06.727 --> 53:09.433
was a stain on the flag of France.

53:10.099 --> 53:15.603
A blot on the honor of every man,
woman and child in the French nation.

53:18.527 --> 53:23.346
It is to us that the sad, distressing...

53:24.056 --> 53:27.849
repellant duty falls gentlemen.

53:28.674 --> 53:34.710
I ask this court to find the accused guilty.

53:37.500 --> 53:41.452
And impose the penalties prescribed
by the Code of Military Justice.

53:45.881 --> 53:47.517
Thank you Mr. Prosecutor.

53:48.545 --> 53:51.237
Colonel, would you like to make your plea?

54:01.294 --> 54:03.078
Gentlemen of the court, there are times...

54:03.108 --> 54:07.642
when I'm ashamed to be a member of the
human race and this is one such occasion.

54:10.167 --> 54:14.074
It's impossible for me to summarize
the case for the defense since the...

54:14.104 --> 54:17.461
court never allowed me a reasonable
opportunity to present my case.

54:17.491 --> 54:20.170
Are you protesting
the authenticity of this court?

54:23.210 --> 54:24.748
Yes sir.

54:25.190 --> 54:27.823
I protest against being
prevented from introducing...

54:27.853 --> 54:30.762
evidence that I
consider vital to the defense.

54:31.310 --> 54:34.120
The prosecution presented no witnesses.

54:34.337 --> 54:38.467
There has never been a written indictment
of charges made against the defendants.

54:38.912 --> 54:41.734
And lastly, I protest against the fact...

54:42.067 --> 54:45.266
that no stenographic records
of this trial have been kept.

54:54.549 --> 54:59.629
The attack yesterday morning
was no stain on the honor of France.

55:01.146 --> 55:04.619
And certainly no disgrace
to the fighting men of this nation.

55:04.649 --> 55:09.535
But this court-martial is
such a stain and such a disgrace.

55:09.781 --> 55:13.718
The case made against these men
is a mockery of all human justice.

55:14.500 --> 55:18.321
Gentlemen of the
court, to find these men guilty...

55:19.378 --> 55:25.038
would be a crime
to haunt each of you till the day you die.

55:28.608 --> 55:33.096
I can't believe
that the noblest impulse of man.

55:33.979 --> 55:37.583
His compassion for another
can be completely dead here.

55:39.450 --> 55:41.795
Therefore, I humbly beg you...

55:43.864 --> 55:45.775
show mercy to these men.

55:53.042 --> 55:57.023
The accused will be escorted back
to the guardroom, the hearing is closed.

55:57.472 --> 55:59.460
The court will now retire to deliberate.

56:00.005 --> 56:02.103
There'll be a guard of six men under arms.

56:02.133 --> 56:05.049
Rifles loaded, bayonets fixed.
Two men to each prisoner.

56:05.535 --> 56:08.069
Any sign of trouble,
the prisoners will be instantly covered...

56:08.099 --> 56:11.283
and if the trouble doesn't subside at once,
the prisoner will be shot on the spot.

56:12.043 --> 56:15.343
Everything must go off without a hitch
with the least possible delay...

56:15.716 --> 56:18.977
It shouldn't be hurried,
there must be no fumbling around.

56:19.484 --> 56:22.721
I've been put in charge
and made personally responsible...

56:22.751 --> 56:25.024
for any lack of order or for any mistakes.

56:25.892 --> 56:30.333
But you can take it from me that I shall
pass on any blame and with interest.

56:30.915 --> 56:32.883
To any one of you who fails in his duties.

56:34.735 --> 56:37.171
Execution will take place at 7 o'clock.

56:37.634 --> 56:39.849
According to the
verdict of the court-martial.

56:42.237 --> 56:44.741
Detail, attention, dismissed.

56:58.898 --> 57:01.170
This is compliments of General Mireau.

57:01.200 --> 57:03.268
- Duck.
- Well, tell him thanks.

57:03.298 --> 57:05.050
Oh, don't blame me soldier.

57:05.899 --> 57:08.461
Hey ugly, what we supposed
to eat this with, our fingers?

57:08.491 --> 57:11.152
The guard says you
can't have any knives or forks.

57:12.549 --> 57:14.402
This supposed to be
our last meal or something?

57:14.573 --> 57:18.394
Isn't supposed to be our last
meal, it is our last meal.

57:18.424 --> 57:20.103
Hey, this duck is terrific.

57:21.073 --> 57:25.386
- You suppose they put anything in the food?
- First they poison us, then they shoot us?

57:29.078 --> 57:31.872
- I think they put something in it.
- Like what?

57:32.567 --> 57:36.866
Like something
to make us groggy or something.

57:37.113 --> 57:38.893
What would be wrong with that if they did?

57:39.327 --> 57:41.918
Maybe nothing for you,
but I'm going to get out of this somehow.

57:42.990 --> 57:44.249
And I don't want to be drugged.

57:44.495 --> 57:47.882
How you going to get out?
Chew your way through that stone wall?

57:48.345 --> 57:51.573
Arnaud, Colonel Dax,
he'll, he'll, he'll see us through.

57:53.759 --> 57:57.174
Listen, we got to get out of here. They're
going to kill us in a few hours if we don't.

57:57.204 --> 58:00.027
- Have you got an idea?
- No, but there's got to be a way.

58:01.764 --> 58:03.796
How many guards you think they got out there?

58:04.326 --> 58:07.235
They may have a couple of squads,
that's what it sounded like this morning.

58:07.626 --> 58:10.424
- Maybe they're some of our friends.
- That's the Third Battalion.

58:10.927 --> 58:13.852
Anyway, right now, we have no friends.

58:14.357 --> 58:16.195
Why kid yourself?
We're not going to get out of this.

58:17.208 --> 58:20.894
Maybe you're not, but I am.
I'll guarantee you of that.

58:22.202 --> 58:23.664
You see that cockroach?

58:24.735 --> 58:27.358
Tomorrow morning,
we'll be dead and it'll be alive.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.871
It'll have more contact
with my wife and child than I will.

58:32.174 --> 58:37.386
- I'll be nothing and it'll be alive.
- Now you got the edge on him.

58:42.581 --> 58:45.404
Good evening my sons, I'm Father Dupree.

58:48.618 --> 58:52.642
- Is there any news?
- Yes, I'm afraid I bring you very bad news.

58:53.525 --> 58:55.030
You must prepare yourselves to the worst.

58:55.060 --> 58:57.752
- Colonel Dax asked me to tell you so.
- Oh mercy, no.

58:57.782 --> 59:00.444
He's been in telephone
contact with army headquarters...

59:00.633 --> 59:04.439
but unable to speak to General Broulard
or for that matter, to anyone in authority.

59:04.628 --> 59:07.551
Same way at
Division, no one wants to be found.

59:07.971 --> 59:10.807
- How much time do we have?
- You've plenty of time yet.

59:10.837 --> 59:13.414
Certainly more than
enough to prepare yourselves.

59:13.631 --> 59:15.557
- In nomine Patris...
- In the name of the Father.

59:15.962 --> 59:20.218
Et Fili et Spiritus Sancti, amen.

59:30.002 --> 59:32.245
Father, will you take
this letter for me please?

59:32.275 --> 59:33.665
Of course, my son.

59:33.695 --> 59:37.254
It's to my wife, she won't understand
this and I tried to explain it to her.

59:37.573 --> 59:41.509
I'll see that she gets it.
Do you want me to hear your confession?

59:42.885 --> 59:45.983
Well Father, to tell you
the truth, I'm not very religious.

59:47.054 --> 59:49.283
I know you're trying
to help and I appreciate it.

59:49.718 --> 59:52.497
But if I started praying now,
I'd feel like a hypocrite.

59:52.700 --> 59:57.187
Oh, that's an error my son. God is
always ready to listen to your prayers.

01:00:00.372 --> 01:00:01.443
All right Father.

01:00:02.312 --> 01:00:05.062
- Will you please hear my confession now?
- Yes.

01:00:06.365 --> 01:00:10.592
Have faith in your
creator my son, death comes to us all.

01:00:11.185 --> 01:00:13.602
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

01:00:13.805 --> 01:00:18.394
That's really deep, death
comes to us all. That really is deep.

01:00:19.118 --> 01:00:21.856
Say, Ferol, what's the matter?
Afraid your luck isn't going to hold out?

01:00:21.886 --> 01:00:24.058
Well look. This is, this is my religion.

01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:27.875
O Great Bottle, forgive me my sins
for now I lay me down to sleep, Bo peep.

01:00:27.905 --> 01:00:29.755
May I drink of you first? Thank you. Amen.

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:32.262
I understand your anguish my son.

01:00:32.661 --> 01:00:35.860
- You must not let it harden your heart.
- May I tell you something Father?

01:00:36.776 --> 01:00:40.642
Back in my hometown, there was a certain
little cafe with amusing sign over the bar.

01:00:41.273 --> 01:00:46.945
It read, do not be afraid to ask for credit
for our way of refusing is very polite.

01:00:46.975 --> 01:00:49.321
- Come on Arnaud, sit down, you're drunk.
- Oh Paris, leave me alone.

01:00:49.351 --> 01:00:50.830
- Come on.
- Paris...

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.032
Cad you, get out of here
with your sanctimonious pat answers.

01:00:54.062 --> 01:00:55.599
What are you hanging
around for, to torture us?

01:00:55.629 --> 01:00:58.862
- No, to help you with all my power.
- Your power? You have no power.

01:00:58.892 --> 01:01:00.559
- Come on Arnaud, take it easy.
- No, but God has power.

01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:03.083
- Does he? Who want to laugh.
- You can be saved.

01:01:03.398 --> 01:01:05.234
Saved? I'll be saved.

01:01:07.948 --> 01:01:08.977
Cut it out Arnaud.

01:01:10.321 --> 01:01:11.230
Arnaud.

01:01:13.344 --> 01:01:13.928
Arnaud.

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.356
Father, get a doctor quick.

01:01:32.793 --> 01:01:34.416
That should keep him quiet long enough.

01:01:34.729 --> 01:01:37.507
That's a nasty skull fracture
though, he may not live out the night.

01:01:37.686 --> 01:01:39.373
What are we supposed to do with him?

01:01:39.772 --> 01:01:43.318
My advice is to tie him to a stretcher
so he won't slip when you tilt it vertically.

01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:46.136
Surely they won't
execute a man in that condition.

01:01:46.701 --> 01:01:48.562
I'm sorry Father, the
sentence will be carried out.

01:01:48.592 --> 01:01:50.439
I already checked with the general on it.

01:01:51.263 --> 01:01:52.442
He's still alive in the morning...

01:01:53.052 --> 01:01:55.501
pinch his cheeks a couple of times
before you take him out on the field.

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:58.449
May make him open his eyes.
The general wants him to be conscious.

01:02:00.158 --> 01:02:00.974
Yes?

01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:06.630
- Lieutenant Roget reporting sir.
- Come in, come in.

01:02:08.421 --> 01:02:10.987
Sergeant Boulanger said
that you wanted see me sir.

01:02:11.017 --> 01:02:12.132
Yes Lieutenant.

01:02:12.611 --> 01:02:15.671
Looks as if we have a pretty unpleasant
thing on our hands in a few hours, ain't it?

01:02:16.153 --> 01:02:19.359
- You mean the execution sir.
- Yes, I mean the execution.

01:02:19.389 --> 01:02:21.197
Yes sir, it's very unfortunate.

01:02:21.327 --> 01:02:24.618
Oh, very unfortunate,
it's just how I feel about it.

01:02:24.943 --> 01:02:28.840
- None of us are happy about it sir.
- How you happen to pick Corporal Paris?

01:02:30.063 --> 01:02:33.566
- Well I, I had to pick somebody sir.
- That's right, you did.

01:02:33.596 --> 01:02:36.442
Of course, you had no personal
motive in picking Paris, did you?

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:37.480
Oh no sir.

01:02:38.499 --> 01:02:40.845
You picked him because
he was a coward, didn't he?

01:02:42.894 --> 01:02:44.238
Well, did you or didn't you?

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:48.668
- Oh yes sir, I did.
- Well...

01:02:49.135 --> 01:02:51.370
Like you say, somebody had to be picked.

01:02:52.278 --> 01:02:55.855
- Oh, it was quite a problem sir.
- Yes, I have the same kind of problem.

01:02:55.885 --> 01:02:58.730
I have to pick someone to be in
charge of the firing squad tomorrow.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.568
You have any objections taking the job?

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.713
- Me sir?
- Yes you.

01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:08.445
What's the matter? Don't you feel well?

01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:12.491
Well, no. Yeah, I,
I feel all right sir, just that I...

01:03:12.602 --> 01:03:14.679
Is it too hot in here?
Would you like me to open a window?

01:03:14.709 --> 01:03:16.385
No sir, no sir.

01:03:16.857 --> 01:03:21.446
Well it's, it's just that I've never been
in charge of a firing squad before sir.

01:03:21.687 --> 01:03:23.806
Oh, it's nothing to it.

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:27.076
First, you help the sergeant
tie the men to the posts.

01:03:27.106 --> 01:03:29.477
Of course, you offer
the men blindfolds and...

01:03:29.507 --> 01:03:31.787
well, if they want them, you tie them on see?

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:34.624
Now you, you take your
position with the firing squad...

01:03:34.654 --> 01:03:37.779
you raise your sword, ready, aim, fire.

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:44.017
Then you draw your revolver out, walk forward
and put a bullet through each man's head.

01:03:45.538 --> 01:03:49.185
Sir, I request that
I'd be excused from this duty.

01:03:49.431 --> 01:03:51.023
Request denied.

01:03:51.053 --> 01:03:53.905
- Colonel I...
- You've got the job, it's all yours.

01:03:54.209 --> 01:03:56.163
- That's all Lieutenant.
- Colonel, if you could just.

01:03:56.193 --> 01:03:59.000
- That's all, Lieutenant, yes?

01:04:00.201 --> 01:04:03.255
- Excuse me sir Colonel Dax?
- Yes.

01:04:03.429 --> 01:04:06.034
My name is Rousseau sir Captain of Artillery.

01:04:06.064 --> 01:04:07.381
What is it Captain?

01:04:13.689 --> 01:04:16.917
I have something to tell you sir, that may
have a great bearing on the court-martial.

01:04:18.582 --> 01:04:19.759
Come in Captain.

01:05:14.811 --> 01:05:17.445
- Well Colonel, good evening.
- Good evening sir.

01:05:17.475 --> 01:05:20.066
- Good evening, come and sit down.
- Thank you sir, I...

01:05:20.645 --> 01:05:22.686
I'm really sorry
to intrude on you in this way.

01:05:22.716 --> 01:05:24.900
Not at all, always
delighted to see you Colonel Dax.

01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:27.491
- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you sir.

01:05:27.912 --> 01:05:30.705
- Well I...
- Think you find it delicious.

01:05:31.213 --> 01:05:34.194
Must apologize for not inviting you
to join the party downstairs tonight but...

01:05:34.224 --> 01:05:37.003
but I'm afraid that it's, a dress affair.

01:05:37.307 --> 01:05:42.431
Thank you sir, but I must confess
that this is not entirely a social visit.

01:05:42.677 --> 01:05:46.890
Oh come Dax, let's not
go over all that ground again.

01:05:48.164 --> 01:05:51.783
Though, I must admit that,
judging from the casualties...

01:05:51.813 --> 01:05:53.817
the efforts of your regiment
must've been considerable.

01:05:54.141 --> 01:05:57.394
Now, how can you understand that
and allow these men to be shot tomorrow?

01:05:57.594 --> 01:06:00.588
Oh come Colonel, you're choosing
to take a rather simple view of this thing.

01:06:00.618 --> 01:06:04.347
Attack was impossible from the start,
the General Staff must've known that.

01:06:06.116 --> 01:06:09.866
Colonel Dax, we think we're doing
a good job running the war.

01:06:10.401 --> 01:06:12.394
You must be aware of
the fact that the General Staff...

01:06:12.424 --> 01:06:15.900
is subject to all kinds of unfair pressures
from newspapers and politicians.

01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:18.924
Maybe the attack
against the Anthill was impossible.

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:22.496
Perhaps it was an error of
judgment on our part, on the other hand...

01:06:22.985 --> 01:06:25.342
if your men had been a
little more daring, might've taken it.

01:06:25.913 --> 01:06:28.270
Who knows? In any case...

01:06:28.566 --> 01:06:31.997
why should we have to bear any more
criticism for failure than we have to.

01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:36.102
Aside from the inescapable fact that a good
many of your men never left the trenches...

01:06:36.132 --> 01:06:38.341
there's the question of
the troops morale, don't forget that.

01:06:38.593 --> 01:06:40.466
- The troops morale?
- Certainly.

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:43.145
These executions will be a
perfect tonic for the entire division.

01:06:43.593 --> 01:06:46.269
There are few things more fundamentally
encouraging and stimulating...

01:06:46.299 --> 01:06:47.698
than seeing someone else die.

01:06:48.122 --> 01:06:51.346
- I never thought of that sir.
- You see Colonel, troops are like children.

01:06:51.509 --> 01:06:54.733
Just as a child wants his father to
be firm, troops crave discipline.

01:06:55.103 --> 01:06:55.733
I see.

01:06:56.059 --> 01:06:58.846
And one way to maintain discipline
is to shoot a man now and then.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.869
May I ask...

01:07:02.515 --> 01:07:05.472
do you sincerely believe
all the things you just said?

01:07:10.184 --> 01:07:12.366
It's been a pleasure
discussing this with you Colonel...

01:07:12.396 --> 01:07:14.634
but I'm afraid that I'd better
be getting back to my guests.

01:07:15.835 --> 01:07:18.296
Forgive me for having
kept you from your party.

01:07:20.726 --> 01:07:22.030
Oh, by the way sir...

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:27.526
have you heard that General Mireau ordered
his own battery commander Captain Rousseau...

01:07:27.938 --> 01:07:30.992
to open fire on his
own positions during the attack?

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:38.030
Of course the captain
refused without a written order...

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:41.758
but General Mireau demanded that he
commence firing on our own trenches.

01:07:42.383 --> 01:07:44.984
Again Rousseau refused
without an order in writing...

01:07:45.014 --> 01:07:48.104
but again he was
ordered and again he refused.

01:07:49.238 --> 01:07:50.957
All in front of witnesses.

01:07:51.202 --> 01:07:53.862
Do you actually believe this fantastic story?

01:07:53.892 --> 01:07:57.494
Here are copies of the sworn statements
from all the principals involved.

01:07:58.236 --> 01:08:01.764
Battery Commander Rousseau,
Captain Nichols, the artillery spotter...

01:08:01.882 --> 01:08:05.588
the telephone clerk and my own deposition.

01:08:06.322 --> 01:08:09.831
What has all this got to do with the
charge against the condemned prisoners?

01:08:10.023 --> 01:08:13.395
A general in a tantrum over
the failure of an impossible attack...

01:08:13.832 --> 01:08:16.510
orders his artillery to fire on his own men.

01:08:17.497 --> 01:08:19.912
Now, this same officer on the same day...

01:08:20.372 --> 01:08:23.737
orders a court-martial in which
three of his men are sentenced to be shot.

01:08:25.611 --> 01:08:30.303
General, what would your newspapers
and your politicians do with that?

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.956
Colonel Dax, are you trying to blackmail me?

01:08:34.246 --> 01:08:37.880
Sir, that's an ugly word,
but you are in a difficult position.

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:41.770
Too much has happened, Someone got
to be hurt, the only question is who.

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:47.720
General Mireau's assault
on the Anthill failed...

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.544
his order to fire on
his own troops was refused.

01:08:51.613 --> 01:08:54.582
But his attempt to murder
three innocent men to protect...

01:08:54.612 --> 01:08:58.145
his own reputation
will be prevented by the General Staff.

01:09:05.572 --> 01:09:09.545
Will you pardon me Colonel Dax?
I've been rude to my guests too long.

01:09:38.648 --> 01:09:40.089
Detail, halt.

01:09:41.917 --> 01:09:42.886
Order arms.

01:09:44.453 --> 01:09:45.113
Fall out.

01:10:11.971 --> 01:10:14.520
Courage my son, the worst is over.

01:10:26.399 --> 01:10:27.585
Good morning Paris.

01:10:29.052 --> 01:10:30.260
Good morning Sergeant.

01:10:31.387 --> 01:10:33.959
- How are you today?
- Not too bad.

01:10:34.773 --> 01:10:35.811
How are you?

01:10:38.597 --> 01:10:40.746
You missed some good chow in here last night.

01:10:41.205 --> 01:10:42.058
What you have?

01:10:45.824 --> 01:10:47.373
Have you got a drink for us?

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:49.974
Take a swig of this.

01:10:54.554 --> 01:10:57.014
It just occurred to me, funny thing.

01:10:58.149 --> 01:11:01.055
I haven't had one sexual
thought since the court-martial.

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:06.222
- Pretty extraordinary thing.
- Pull yourself together, act like a man.

01:11:07.958 --> 01:11:10.796
- Listen Paris, are you listening to me?
- Yes.

01:11:11.304 --> 01:11:13.394
There'll be a lot of dignitaries,
newspapermen out there.

01:11:13.424 --> 01:11:15.484
You got a wife and family,
how do you want to be remembered?

01:11:16.233 --> 01:11:17.782
I don't want to die.

01:11:18.012 --> 01:11:20.183
Many of us will be joining
you before this war is over.

01:11:20.339 --> 01:11:22.414
I don't care, I don't want to die.

01:11:24.081 --> 01:11:28.365
- Please save me Sergeant.
- I can't save you, no one can now.

01:11:30.061 --> 01:11:32.611
This is the last decision
you have a chance to make on earth.

01:11:32.885 --> 01:11:35.946
You can pull yourself together, act like a
man or we'll have to drag you out of here.

01:11:36.339 --> 01:11:38.519
In the end, it'll all
be the same, it's up to you.

01:11:55.999 --> 01:11:58.563
Well, let's get busy.
You and Ferol take your coats off.

01:11:59.090 --> 01:12:00.449
It's no use hanging around here.

01:12:18.819 --> 01:12:22.925
With the help of thy grace
do penance and to amend my life.

01:12:31.383 --> 01:12:33.910
Why do I have to die? For what?

01:12:36.876 --> 01:12:40.022
Why do I have to die?
Why? I didn't do anything.

01:12:40.052 --> 01:12:42.630
We do not question the will of God my son.

01:12:43.283 --> 01:12:47.411
But I fought, I fought,
I fought on the battlefield.

01:12:47.604 --> 01:12:51.224
Why don't they die?
Why not put them to death?

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:55.449
Showed courage in the face of the enemy my
son, show it now before your own troops.

01:12:55.553 --> 01:12:57.421
But I'm scared, I'm scared.

01:12:59.957 --> 01:13:01.817
Oh Father...

01:13:03.432 --> 01:13:06.382
Courage, brace yourself man, brace yourself.

01:13:13.386 --> 01:13:17.214
He said, this day,
thou shalt be with me in paradise.

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:20.163
- Really Father?
- Yes.

01:13:20.193 --> 01:13:22.051
Really Father?

01:13:23.792 --> 01:13:26.552
I don't understand why?

01:13:28.755 --> 01:13:31.149
I'll never see nobody again Father.

01:13:31.927 --> 01:13:33.639
Courage man, brace yourself.

01:13:34.217 --> 01:13:36.100
- I can't help it.
- Brace yourself.

01:13:37.394 --> 01:13:41.124
- I can't help it Father.
- O God, O Almighty God.

01:13:41.814 --> 01:13:44.974
- Oh Christ, Christ.
- Grant courage...

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:47.965
- to this man who is about to die.
- Strengthen me God please strengthen me.

01:13:54.332 --> 01:13:56.836
Why do I have to die Father?

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:01.942
Why do I have to die Father?

01:14:01.972 --> 01:14:03.728
Half face.

01:14:14.828 --> 01:14:17.222
Secure prisoners.

01:14:19.742 --> 01:14:23.595
Detail, attention. Forward, march.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:37.541
Detail, halt.

01:14:38.008 --> 01:14:40.290
Left, face.

01:14:51.397 --> 01:14:53.991
Please don't shoot me.

01:15:14.563 --> 01:15:16.866
In the name of the French People...

01:15:17.489 --> 01:15:18.826
Corporal Philippe Paris...

01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:21.163
Private Maurice Ferol...

01:15:21.735 --> 01:15:25.041
and Private Pierre Arnaud
of the 701st Regiment...

01:15:25.945 --> 01:15:30.274
having been found guilty of
cowardice in the face of the enemy...

01:15:31.321 --> 01:15:33.849
are to be executed by
rifle fire immediately...

01:15:34.536 --> 01:15:37.271
in accordance with the judgment
of the military court-martial.

01:15:43.948 --> 01:15:46.282
Right, face.

01:15:47.453 --> 01:15:49.766
Forward march.

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:08.308
And blessed are thou amongst thy.

01:16:08.338 --> 01:16:09.813
Do you want a blindfold?

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:13.189
Yes Lieutenant please.

01:16:19.132 --> 01:16:23.295
I don't want to die, I don't want to die.

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:38.157
- Do, do you want a blindfold?
- No.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:41.515
I'm sorry.

01:17:20.647 --> 01:17:21.529
Ready.

01:17:25.025 --> 01:17:25.996
Aim.

01:17:28.427 --> 01:17:30.347
Fire.

01:17:33.652 --> 01:17:35.467
I'm awfully glad you could be there George.

01:17:36.313 --> 01:17:38.174
This sort of thing is always rather grim.

01:17:38.952 --> 01:17:41.271
But this one had a kind
of splendor to it, don't you think?

01:17:41.382 --> 01:17:43.865
I have never seen an affair
of this sort handled any better.

01:17:44.479 --> 01:17:46.015
The men died wonderfully.

01:17:46.718 --> 01:17:48.741
There's always that chance that
one of them will do something that...

01:17:48.771 --> 01:17:51.728
leave everyone with a bad taste.
This time, you couldn't ask for better.

01:17:54.232 --> 01:17:55.315
Yes?

01:17:57.049 --> 01:17:59.540
- Yes Colonel?
- You wanted to see me sir.

01:17:59.836 --> 01:18:02.845
Oh, yes, yes.
Come in Colonel, come in and sit down.

01:18:04.171 --> 01:18:07.899
Oh Colonel Dax, your men died very well.

01:18:11.138 --> 01:18:13.784
- Would you like some coffee Colonel?
- No, thank you sir.

01:18:14.088 --> 01:18:15.162
Oh, by the way Paul...

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.689
It's been brought to my attention
that you ordered your artillery to...

01:18:17.719 --> 01:18:20.031
fire on your own men
during the attack on the Anthill.

01:18:22.388 --> 01:18:23.329
I did what?

01:18:24.804 --> 01:18:25.760
Who told you that?

01:18:25.871 --> 01:18:27.776
Colonel Dax came to
me last night with the story.

01:18:30.814 --> 01:18:34.941
Colonel Dax, I've always known
that you were a disloyal officer...

01:18:35.394 --> 01:18:38.546
but I never dreamed that you would
stoop to anything so low as this.

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:42.319
General, I have sworn statements from
Captain Nichols, your artillery spotter...

01:18:43.194 --> 01:18:45.939
Captain Rousseau, the battery
commander who refused your order.

01:18:45.969 --> 01:18:48.377
I think it's infamous, absolutely infamous.

01:18:48.407 --> 01:18:50.623
Then there's no truth at all
to the charge made by Colonel Dax?

01:18:50.786 --> 01:18:53.032
I don't see how you could even ask me that.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.619
You cannot imagine
how glad I am to hear that Paul.

01:18:55.649 --> 01:18:57.472
I'm certain that
you'll come through it all right.

01:18:58.369 --> 01:19:00.963
- I'll come through what?
- There'll have to be an inquiry.

01:19:01.253 --> 01:19:02.290
An inquiry?

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.661
But it won't amount to much, those
things never do, the public forgets.

01:19:04.772 --> 01:19:05.558
Public?

01:19:05.795 --> 01:19:07.396
You got to have the right to clear your name.

01:19:07.551 --> 01:19:11.553
You cannot allow such vile insinuations
against your character to go undenied.

01:19:12.977 --> 01:19:14.399
So that's it.

01:19:16.007 --> 01:19:17.660
You're making me the goat.

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:21.114
The only completely
innocent man in this whole affair.

01:19:25.456 --> 01:19:28.088
I have only one last thing
to say to you George...

01:19:29.214 --> 01:19:32.438
The man you stabbed in the back is a soldier.

01:19:41.563 --> 01:19:42.408
Well...

01:19:44.676 --> 01:19:45.848
had to be done.

01:19:46.403 --> 01:19:49.412
France cannot afford to have fools
guiding her military destiny.

01:19:49.916 --> 01:19:52.583
I'm grateful to you Dax for having
brought this matter to my attention.

01:19:52.984 --> 01:19:56.445
Colonel Dax, how would
you like General Mireau's job?

01:19:58.312 --> 01:20:00.751
- His what sir?
- His job.

01:20:01.929 --> 01:20:03.014
Let me get this straight sir.

01:20:04.355 --> 01:20:07.098
You're offering me General Mireau's command?

01:20:07.409 --> 01:20:10.012
Come, come Colonel
Dax, don't overdo the surprise.

01:20:10.168 --> 01:20:13.014
You've been after the job from
the start, we all know that my boy.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.719
I may be many things sir,
but I'm not your boy.

01:20:17.749 --> 01:20:20.492
Well, I certainly didn't mean to
imply any biological relationship.

01:20:20.618 --> 01:20:22.848
- I'm not your boy in any sense.
- You trying to provoke me Colonel?

01:20:22.878 --> 01:20:24.605
- Why should I want to do that sir?
- Exactly.

01:20:24.635 --> 01:20:26.843
Would be a pity to lose
your promotion before you get it.

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:29.437
A promotion you have
so very carefully planned for.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.344
Sir, would you like me to suggest
what you can do with that promotion?

01:20:36.167 --> 01:20:39.954
Colonel Dax, you will apologize at once,
or I shall have you placed under arrest.

01:20:41.786 --> 01:20:45.025
I apologize for not being
entirely honest with you.

01:20:45.751 --> 01:20:48.627
I apologize for not
revealing my true feelings.

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:54.660
I apologize sir, for not telling you sooner
that you're a degenerate, sadistic old man.

01:20:54.978 --> 01:20:59.062
And you can go to hell before I
apologize to you now or ever again.

01:21:00.975 --> 01:21:04.584
Colonel Dax, you're a disappointment to me.

01:21:05.563 --> 01:21:09.219
You've spoiled the keenness of your
mind by wallowing in sentimentality.

01:21:09.868 --> 01:21:11.484
You really did want to save those men.

01:21:12.025 --> 01:21:14.020
And you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:18.393
You're an idealist and I pity you
as I would the village idiot.

01:21:18.771 --> 01:21:21.068
We're fighting a war Dax,
a war that we got to win.

01:21:21.372 --> 01:21:23.194
Those men didn't fight so they were shot.

01:21:23.395 --> 01:21:26.433
You bring charges against General
Mireau, so I insist that he answer them.

01:21:27.938 --> 01:21:29.131
Wherein have I done wrong?

01:21:33.008 --> 01:21:35.209
Because you don't know
the answer to that question...

01:21:37.914 --> 01:21:39.181
I pity you.

01:22:07.358 --> 01:22:11.096
Thank you, thank you. Now gentlemen, we
have a little special entertainment for you.

01:22:15.679 --> 01:22:18.621
Sort of a, sort of a little
diversion as it were.

01:22:18.651 --> 01:22:22.682
And as my wife always says,
what is life without a little diversion?

01:22:25.632 --> 01:22:29.730
Now gentlemen, I give you
our latest acquisition from the enemy.

01:22:31.792 --> 01:22:36.164
From Germany, the land of the Hun.

01:23:00.109 --> 01:23:06.149
Gentlemen, a little pearl
washed ashore by the tide of war.

01:23:15.838 --> 01:23:18.424
Hey. Talk in a civilized language.

01:23:20.166 --> 01:23:22.820
It's true the little lady
has her limitations.

01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:25.948
As a matter of fact,
she has absolutely no talent at all.

01:23:26.044 --> 01:23:29.883
Except that is,
well, maybe a little natural talent?

01:23:34.633 --> 01:23:38.012
Little lady can't dance,
she can't tell any jokes...

01:23:38.042 --> 01:23:40.836
and she can't balance
rubber balls on her little nose.

01:23:41.617 --> 01:23:44.460
Ah, but she can sing like a bird.

01:23:44.490 --> 01:23:46.182
She has a throat of gold.

01:23:46.212 --> 01:23:48.642
- Come on baby.
- Come on honey, sing us a song.

01:23:48.672 --> 01:23:51.540
Come on honey, how about a song?

01:24:07.243 --> 01:24:10.186
Louder. Louder.

01:26:23.838 --> 01:26:25.394
- Sir.
- Yes Sergeant?

01:26:25.595 --> 01:26:28.063
We have orders
to move back to the front immediately.

01:26:30.279 --> 01:26:32.755
- Give the men a few minutes more Sergeant.
- Yes sir.
