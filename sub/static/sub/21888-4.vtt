Did you die?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.206
I didn't die, no.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.835
What the fuck happened to you?

10:32.090 --> 10:34.468
You know, I mean, start again?

10:34.509 --> 10:36.720
You can just start again,
is that what you can do?

10:40.766 --> 10:43.185
I had no choice.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.270
I wasn't the father
in that house.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.772
He was.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.106
Rose's dad.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.316
Haim.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.401
Huh. Your grandfather.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.528
He was the boss.

10:53.570 --> 10:58.408
He... he loved to punish people.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.620
He had fists like cantaloupes.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.790
Bam.
(chuckles)

11:04.831 --> 11:09.336
"You do it my way, or you
get the hell out of here."

11:09.378 --> 11:11.588
The day he showed me the door,

11:11.630 --> 11:14.966
I grabbed my stuff
and I ran for it.

11:15.008 --> 11:19.846
JOSH: So, yeah,
I was the only man in the house

11:19.888 --> 11:21.848
when, when I was growing up.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.767
Yeah.

11:23.809 --> 11:27.562
But for super
complicated reasons,

11:27.604 --> 11:30.524
I was... I was not aware

11:30.565 --> 11:33.610
that I was the only man
in my house.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.237
I'm not trying to be convoluted,

11:35.278 --> 11:36.988
it's just... it's very hard
to explain.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.449
Um, but, um...

11:41.618 --> 11:44.246
There was a lot of confusion.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.288
MOSHE:
But then,

11:45.330 --> 11:46.915
Israel.

11:46.957 --> 11:51.002
Yeah, it was... a new country.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.673
A country for us,
our safe haven.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.259
And if that doesn't scream
second chance,

11:57.300 --> 11:59.678
I don't know what does.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.181
And I sure grabbed a hold of it.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.766
JOSH:
You know, I was a kid

12:04.808 --> 12:07.144
when stuff started
with the older woman.

12:07.185 --> 12:11.606
I mean, at the time I was,
like, bragging about it.

12:11.648 --> 12:15.068
It was, like,
I was the stud of the century.

12:16.445 --> 12:19.406
(laughs softly)

12:19.448 --> 12:24.077
Um... And, I mean,
I was pretty pumped about it.

12:24.119 --> 12:28.790
You know, I was getting
my 15-year-old fuck on.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.126
And, um...

12:31.168 --> 12:34.004
My parents knew.

12:34.045 --> 12:38.758
They thought it was, uh-- or
they acted like it was normal.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.219
Like, that's what men do.
Men fuck, right?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.013
(inhales)

12:43.054 --> 12:46.391
(exhales)

12:46.433 --> 12:48.727
But it wasn't normal.

12:52.314 --> 12:56.276
This person, Rita...

12:58.820 --> 13:01.448
...she fucking owned me.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.956
She owns me.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.049
Nobody knew me here.

13:21.051 --> 13:25.263
I was not a disappointment
to anyone here.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.601
Hmm.

13:29.643 --> 13:34.064
I was just a... new Jew
with a bright future.

13:34.105 --> 13:38.693
So I made myself,
made my fortune,

13:38.735 --> 13:43.782
and I made my family.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.125
And you never looked back.

Shame is a funny thing.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.494
I would say that a sex addict

15:52.535 --> 15:57.540
is someone who puts sex
at the front of everything.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.001

16:00.043 --> 16:03.421

a... a little hostile,

A little hostile. -Thank you.

Like, by itself.

Fuck!

21:31.749 --> 21:34.335
(sighs)

21:36.546 --> 21:38.673
(sighs)

21:40.883 --> 21:43.302
Hmm.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.470
Oh, fuck.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.847
-What?
-Hmm?

21:45.888 --> 21:47.598
We got to get our fucking kids.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.142
Oh, my God, yeah.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.810
-We have to get our kids.
-Oh, yeah.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.478
-Like, for real this time.
-We have to go now, right?

21:52.520 --> 21:53.730
(groans)

21:53.771 --> 21:55.940
-Super fun.
-Yeah.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.692
Oh, I don't want to go.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.694
(both chuckling and moaning)

22:01.237 --> 22:03.031
-Whoa, what is happening?
-(laughing): Sorry.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.908
-What's happening? -Okay, okay,
okay, I'm going, I'm going.

22:05.950 --> 22:09.537
That was really fun.
Thank you so much.

22:09.579 --> 22:11.080
LEN:
Where's my phone?

22:11.122 --> 22:12.498
SARAH:
Where are my shoes?

22:12.540 --> 22:14.667
(chuckles)

22:14.709 --> 22:17.003
SARAH:
Okay. Bye, Lila.

22:24.719 --> 22:27.305
MAURA: I have one last question
before we go.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.515
What about Mom?

22:29.557 --> 22:31.642
How could you leave her?

22:31.684 --> 22:34.228
Aye, Rose.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.897
Rose never loved me.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.732
She was like a depressed person.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.484
Why? Why was she so depressed?

22:39.525 --> 22:41.319
Why?
'Cause of the fucking Holocaust.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.820
You ever heard of it?

22:42.862 --> 22:45.948
I'm trying to explain to you,
some families

22:45.990 --> 22:47.533
got out.

22:47.575 --> 22:51.287
But... no family
ever got out clean.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.331
You know what I mean?

22:53.372 --> 22:55.708
Like your mother.
You can't blame her

22:55.750 --> 22:57.835
because of the death of her
brother-- uh, uh...

22:57.877 --> 22:59.629
or sister...
(mumbles)

22:59.670 --> 23:02.381
-What do you, what do you mean?
-What are you talking about?

23:02.423 --> 23:03.841
Gershon, Gittel,
Gittel, Gershon...

23:03.883 --> 23:05.093
ALI:
What do you mean?

23:05.134 --> 23:07.887
Gershon was Gittel's husband.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.722
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

23:09.764 --> 23:12.141
-Gershon and Gittel were the
same person. -They were married.

23:12.183 --> 23:13.893
-No, they...
-That's impossible.

23:13.935 --> 23:15.478
I'm telling you, it's like

23:15.520 --> 23:17.814
what you are, Gittel was;
the same thing.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.398
Trans, what do you call that?

23:19.440 --> 23:22.235
A trans something?

23:22.276 --> 23:24.570
I'm sorry, you're saying
that Gittel was transgender?

23:24.612 --> 23:25.738
Transgender.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.198
Yeah.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.825
What? Is this...?

23:28.866 --> 23:32.870
-Look, I never said...
-Yeah.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.040
I never-- I never said...

23:36.082 --> 23:37.375
Rose never told you this?

23:44.674 --> 23:45.758
What is it, Mom?

23:48.970 --> 23:50.429
MOSHE:
Nobody ever told you?

23:52.974 --> 23:55.393
ALI:
Oh, my God.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.936
Is it po-- is it possible?

23:56.978 --> 23:59.021
I-I can't.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.398
I can't.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.774
I have to go.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.151
Wh-Why? What?

24:03.192 --> 24:04.902
MAURA:
I...

24:04.944 --> 24:06.487
I can't, um...

24:07.697 --> 24:09.574
ALI:
Okay, okay.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.826
Are you all right?

24:11.868 --> 24:13.661
Is he all right or is he...?

24:13.703 --> 24:15.413
-She, she, she's-- no, she's...
-She, she's all right?

24:16.831 --> 24:18.249
Uh, no. Thank you.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.333
Sorry.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.211
-You're welcome.
-Tha-Thank you.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.025
You okay?

24:49.447 --> 24:52.283
Why didn't they tell me?

24:56.787 --> 25:00.666
My whole life,
I thought I was alone in this.
