WEBVTT

00:45.840 --> 00:47.683
What were you thinking, Marin?

00:49.120 --> 00:52.488
A girl in Assendelft died
trying to lose a baby with poison.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.084
How far gone are you?

01:05.760 --> 01:06.841
<i>6...</i>

01:08.920 --> 01:09.921
7 months...

01:10.280 --> 01:11.406
Perhaps more...

01:13.400 --> 01:15.084
How did you hide it?

01:16.040 --> 01:17.724
I let out my skirts.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.690
I bound my breasts.

01:21.560 --> 01:25.042
Soaked my rags in animal blood
so Cornelia wouldn't suspect.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.291
Tell me...

01:34.760 --> 01:35.761
is it Frans'?

01:37.360 --> 01:40.648
He was just angry about the sugar,
Marin, he loves you.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.285
Tell him about this.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.610
Once he knows
he will not harm Johannes

01:44.680 --> 01:46.330
because it'd endanger his child.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.324
You don't understand.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.204
If he survives...

01:57.000 --> 01:58.570
this child will be...

02:00.200 --> 02:05.730
stained with his mother's sin,
with his father's sin.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.046
It's a baby,

02:13.280 --> 02:14.441
not a devil.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.285
Animal blood on her rags to fool us...

02:20.760 --> 02:22.683
She always was clever.

02:26.920 --> 02:27.967
The crib...

02:29.320 --> 02:30.367
Did you know?

02:31.400 --> 02:32.845
No, of course not.

02:34.760 --> 02:38.446
Then why is the doll of Madame Marin
carrying a child?

02:39.880 --> 02:41.564
What are you talking about?

02:43.760 --> 02:45.728
How could you betray us like this?

02:45.880 --> 02:49.851
You know how rumors spread.
- I didn't order it. It just came.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.486
Then who is it that's spying on us?

02:53.640 --> 02:56.007
I don't think she's a spy.
- She?

02:59.480 --> 03:00.811
She sees our lives.

03:01.720 --> 03:04.530
I think she's trying to help us,
trying to warn us.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.364
How has she helped us?

03:06.800 --> 03:08.643
The Seigneur is gone,
Otto too,

03:08.720 --> 03:11.644
and now Marin carries the shame
of the man who wishes to destroy us.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.767
Look.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.607
This was white when it arrived.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.530
This is witchcraft.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.765
She's not a witch.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.567
How dare she send you
things like this?

03:22.640 --> 03:24.324
What else does she know?

03:31.120 --> 03:32.451
Open up!

03:33.040 --> 03:34.201
It's the militia!

03:34.600 --> 03:39.606
Marin, they cannot see you like this.
Especially Frans. Cornelia!

03:41.760 --> 03:43.762
St George's Militia. Open up!

03:53.280 --> 03:54.645
We've come for Johannes Brandt.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.365
He's not here, Seigneur.
He's travelling.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.851
Don't lie. We know he's here.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.287
You don't want to make a fuss
on your doorstep.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.567
Good day.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.446
Frans! Tell them!
- It's out of my hands.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.166
We're here under the jurisdiction
of Schout Slabbaert.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.044
A young man's been attacked
on the Eastern islands

04:10.120 --> 04:12.202
and there are witnesses to back it up,
now go and fetch your master.

04:12.360 --> 04:13.486
I said good day.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.447
I told you he's not here!

04:16.000 --> 04:18.002
Frans, all of you,
you're better than this!

04:18.480 --> 04:20.209
Go and catch your thieves,
your murderers.

04:20.279 --> 04:22.362
My husband has helped
make this Republic great.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.130
What he is
is a sodomite.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.009
All the money in Amsterdam
won't save him.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.003
Get out of my way!
Search the house!

04:28.600 --> 04:30.125
Frans!
- Search every room!

04:30.640 --> 04:31.482
Frans!

04:32.600 --> 04:33.761
Frans, please!

04:35.720 --> 04:36.562
Listen to me!

04:37.120 --> 04:38.406
Sir, they've found him!

04:38.520 --> 04:39.851
They've found him!
- Where?

04:40.120 --> 04:42.851
On a ship by the docks,
about to set sail.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.530
They're taking him
to the Stadhuis now.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.966
To the Stadhuis!

04:53.080 --> 04:53.922
Madame!

04:54.240 --> 04:56.686
Madame, you cannot!
- Let go of me, Cornelia!

04:56.840 --> 05:00.640
No, I will not hear of it!
- You can't go, Madame! Please!

05:00.760 --> 05:02.125
Cornelia's right.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.963
If you follow them
you'll be arrested as well.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.961
Where is your heart, Marin?
I would never abandon my brother!

05:09.200 --> 05:12.602
To fight them in the open
is to invite certain defeat.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.603
Then I will find another way.

05:25.160 --> 05:26.491
How do I look?

05:27.920 --> 05:29.843
Like a serving girl
on an errand.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.367
You really think
a disguise is necessary?

05:32.880 --> 05:35.360
If the Burgomasters find out
his wife's trying to deal in sugar

05:35.440 --> 05:36.487
who knows what they will do?

05:36.560 --> 05:39.086
I still don't think you should go
to the Eastern islands alone.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.166
Johannes is in a cell,
and you need to stay here with Marin.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.364
We may be able to bribe Jack
to change his story.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.246
I will visit Johannes afterwards
if they let me in.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.041
Is there a message
you'd like me to send?

05:55.120 --> 05:57.168
There's nothing I can say.
- Marin...

05:58.680 --> 06:00.091
Hope is dangerous.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.204
Hope is all we have.

06:04.360 --> 06:05.850
Hope and sugar.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.645
Bribing officials...

07:41.760 --> 07:44.127
We need all the friends we can get.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.086
Thank you.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.611
They seem to think
food is an option here.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.403
What have they done to you?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.206
It's nothing.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.240
Tell me...

08:13.640 --> 08:14.880
was it love?

08:17.680 --> 08:19.364
I don't know.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.203
By telling me lies
he made me see the truth.

08:30.280 --> 08:34.126
The way sometimes a painting
is more beautiful than the thing itself.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.048
It was a painting of love,

08:41.600 --> 08:43.602
but I couldn't tell the difference.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.204
Nor did I care to.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.002
You can fight this, Johannes.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.489
You're powerful, rich...

08:55.080 --> 08:58.050
You said it yourself,
Burgomasters cannot touch you.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.122
They have a name for it.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.083
The unmentionable sin.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.327
Two men together, an act which
only God has the power to forgive.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.920
To do nothing would be to condone it.
- Then...

09:10.640 --> 09:12.608
we make Frans Meermans
change his mind.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.724
I've let his anger stew, now
he's determined to take his revenge.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.365
Jack, then.
- Nella!

09:18.600 --> 09:20.125
I'll pay him off.
- Nella!

09:23.000 --> 09:24.365
It won't make any difference.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.405
What if we had a child?

09:37.560 --> 09:38.925
To prove the lie.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.924
Where will we get
one of those in a couple of weeks?

09:49.640 --> 09:51.324
I'm glad you came, Nella.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.291
I don't deserve you.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.004
I wish I'd been enough.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.844
You have been a miracle.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.570
Rezeki.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.124
Take her everywhere I go.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.800
The red's gone...

10:19.560 --> 10:20.607
from the wound.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.245
I don't understand.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.890
Must have worn it off.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.689
What on Earth?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.529
Madame Marin ordered it.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.321
It came in a big crate today.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.805
It's the same one
as the Miniaturist sent me.

10:50.720 --> 10:51.801
I know.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.287
Marin!

10:57.680 --> 10:59.091
What were you thinking?

11:00.080 --> 11:02.606
If the neighbours saw this arrive,
what would they think?

11:02.680 --> 11:03.966
The same as you.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.241
I know you want this child
for yourself.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.925
Marin, that's not true.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.801
But it would be convenient, no?

11:18.880 --> 11:19.881
Well...

11:21.160 --> 11:24.403
So what if we did pretend
the child was mine?

11:24.800 --> 11:26.245
Would that be so awful?

11:26.320 --> 11:29.529
It would prove that Johannes
has the same desires as other men.

11:30.960 --> 11:35.249
Don't you want him to live?
- This child will be far from convenient.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.201
But no one will take it away from me.
No one.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.170
Ah, he's kicking me!

11:48.640 --> 11:50.369
We need a midwife soon.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.324
Do you know the law?

11:54.560 --> 11:58.167
A midwife must write down
the name of the father.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.327
If we don't tell her,
she'll report that, too.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.162
Talk to Frans, Marin.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.810
Tell him about his child.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.451
You speak of things
of which you know nothing.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.809
Do you want to know the truth?

12:21.080 --> 12:22.889
Johannes stopped my marriage.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.410
But it wasn't his decision.

12:27.760 --> 12:28.807
It was mine.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.971
I told him, too.

12:31.760 --> 12:32.761
You?

12:33.360 --> 12:36.250
By the time I was a woman
I ran this household.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.411
And with Johannes away,
I was head of it.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.764
Was I supposed to give up my freedom
for a man?

12:45.680 --> 12:47.045
I thought it a kindness

12:47.120 --> 12:49.487
to let Frans believe I was forbidden,

12:49.800 --> 12:53.282
than to know I didn't love him enough
to sacrifice my liberty.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.166
I never meant it to twist this way.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.890
It is his child you're carrying though...

13:15.880 --> 13:17.006
isn't it?

13:22.880 --> 13:26.282
I've taken things from my brother
I was not meant to take.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.967
Don't let sweet weapons stray.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.567
Hanna?

14:23.880 --> 14:24.927
Hanna!

14:26.600 --> 14:29.046
I hadn't expected there
to be so much.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.882
Imagine it transformed into guilders.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.247
Some of it is rotten.
- Very little,

14:34.880 --> 14:35.927
Madame.

14:36.480 --> 14:40.166
A few were refined in Suriname,
but the rest were refined here.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.046
In the city.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.408
How much for the Amsterdam stock?

14:47.720 --> 14:52.044
There are 750 loaves from the city
at 40 guilders each,

14:54.480 --> 14:55.606
30,000 guilders.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.921
Impossible.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.091
We are bakers of cakes,
not sellers of sugar.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.481
Its quality alone will guarantee it sells.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.925
The craving for sugar
shows no sign of abating.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.288
The more the Burgomasters forbid it,
the more people will yearn for it.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.965
The prices will rise.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.161
100 Amsterdam loaves
for 900 guilders.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.810
If it makes a profit
we'll be back for more.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.721
3,500.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.969
1,100.
- 2,000.

15:28.040 --> 15:30.361
I have other buyers
coming this afternoon.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.401
1,500.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.561
Done.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.805
Madame! Johannes is to appear today!

16:11.040 --> 16:13.168
<i>Look... There' s Agnes.</i>

16:15.600 --> 16:17.204
What's she fiddling with?

16:22.760 --> 16:24.171
The sugar, Madame...

16:24.840 --> 16:27.764
We've already promised half the loaves
we took this morning.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.930
Arnoud wants to send some
to The Hague, where he has family.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.526
I'm sure it won't be long
before we come to you for more.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.241
Seigneur...

16:39.640 --> 16:40.687
Seigneur!

16:44.400 --> 16:47.404
Good people of Amsterdam,

16:47.960 --> 16:51.282
we have made success
for our city.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.011
But we have remained righteous.

16:55.480 --> 17:01.044
We have not wasted ourselves
in the surfeit of our fortune.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.529
But here before you

17:03.720 --> 17:06.929
is a man who took another path.

17:08.480 --> 17:12.530
He considered that he was
above the family,

17:13.599 --> 17:17.241
above the city,
above the church,

17:18.119 --> 17:20.042
above the State,

17:20.680 --> 17:23.080
above God himself.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.284
You accuse me, sir,

17:29.200 --> 17:32.283
but the truth of the accusation
is yet to be tested.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.763
You deny the charge?

17:36.480 --> 17:37.811
If I'm to defend myself

17:37.880 --> 17:40.486
I'm entitled to know the specifics
of the accusation.

17:42.720 --> 17:46.520
On Sunday the 4th of January,

17:47.080 --> 17:52.086
Jack Philips says that you attacked
and sodomized him.

17:53.880 --> 17:58.681
And left him so badly beaten
that he could barely walk.

17:59.400 --> 18:04.088
And then you tried
to buy his silence.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.120
Is that specific enough for you?

18:09.760 --> 18:11.603
If any such thing happened...

18:12.480 --> 18:13.811
it was not me.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.449
My conscience is clear.

18:19.640 --> 18:23.087
We have witnesses ready
to swear on the Holy Bible

18:23.160 --> 18:24.446
that they saw you.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.365
Then they are lying.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.802
You are married?

18:31.200 --> 18:32.247
I am.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.047
And what sort of a husband are you?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.044
Well, I'm still in one piece.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.001
Are you a good or a bad husband?

18:42.560 --> 18:44.562
My wife is wealthy and secure.

18:45.440 --> 18:49.081
To be wealthy
does not mean to be content.

18:49.600 --> 18:53.002
That is a rich man's answer.
Try telling that to a poor man.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.170
You have no children.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.206
Why not?

18:59.520 --> 19:01.807
I have been married
but 4 months.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.365
How often do you lie with your wife?
- That is between me and her.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.202
You are late to marry.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.604
She was worth the wait.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.207
You have, over the years,

19:19.120 --> 19:21.851
employed many apprentices.

19:22.960 --> 19:27.921
A preponderance of young men...
- Are not all apprentices young men?

19:28.120 --> 19:31.124
More than any other
senior member of the company!

19:31.600 --> 19:33.807
I have the figures here!

19:34.000 --> 19:36.924
I have more money and more business
than most of them

19:37.000 --> 19:38.206
but isn't that why I'm really here?

19:39.720 --> 19:42.291
Who'll take my business if I drown?
Will it be you?

19:42.360 --> 19:46.001
Schout Slabbaert, dividing it up?
Or will you lock it in the Stadhuis coffers?

19:46.080 --> 19:47.081
Silence!

19:47.800 --> 19:51.043
You insult the city of Amsterdam!

19:52.760 --> 19:54.205
Bring in the plaintiff.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.767
Are you Jack Philips?

20:07.400 --> 20:10.722
By trade, a delivery boy
and a stower?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.571
I am, but by trade an actor.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.165
The others by necessity.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.926
Hand him the Bible.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.691
Do you swear to tell the truth
for us today?

20:24.880 --> 20:25.927
I swear.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.528
And do you recognise this man?

20:30.480 --> 20:32.687
Oh, look at him, boy.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.450
Do you recognise him?

20:40.600 --> 20:41.601
I do.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.690
What charges
do you bring against him?

20:48.160 --> 20:50.561
That he sodomized me
against my will,

20:51.400 --> 20:53.448
stabbed me in the chest
when I resisted

20:53.520 --> 20:56.000
and offered me money
for my silence afterwards.

20:56.920 --> 21:00.527
His attack produced the wound
that you bear now?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.084
He only just missed my heart.

21:03.480 --> 21:09.089
And how did he behave
before he... seized you?

21:09.320 --> 21:11.209
He was in a frenzy, sir.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.721
I pushed him away.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.168
I told him to leave me alone,
but he took me by my coat sleeves

21:16.320 --> 21:18.926
and pushed me up
against the walls of his warehouse.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.521
And then?

21:21.720 --> 21:22.721
He...

21:25.240 --> 21:27.322
He... used me.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.603
He sodomized you?

21:30.120 --> 21:32.930
Lies! Lies! This is all lies!

21:33.120 --> 21:36.124
You said he wouldn't speak to me!
- Silence, Brandt!

21:36.320 --> 21:37.924
You'll get your chance.

21:38.720 --> 21:39.960
Now, marl,

21:40.360 --> 21:42.522
you are entirely sure...

21:43.440 --> 21:45.329
and you swear before God...

21:45.480 --> 21:49.451
that the man who assaulted you
was Johannes Brandt?

21:51.600 --> 21:53.489
Answer me, boy!

21:55.560 --> 21:57.722
Tell them the truth, Jack.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.201
Tell them.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.087
Enough! Take him away!

22:10.480 --> 22:11.686
Wait, wait!

22:12.520 --> 22:14.204
Show us the wound.
- What?

22:14.760 --> 22:16.842
He says this attack happened
on the 4th of January.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.321
What difference does it make?
- 6 days ago.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.289
What is your point, Brandt?

22:21.800 --> 22:24.451
If he's telling the truth,
it will still be fresh.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.610
But if he received it in a different place,
at a different time,

22:27.880 --> 22:31.327
a fortnight ago or more, say,
it will have begun to heal.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.050
So show us, Jack.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.445
Show us the wound.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.486
Show us!

22:45.720 --> 22:48.564
Enough! Get him out! Take him away!

22:48.760 --> 22:51.525
He cannot show us because
he knows it'd prove he's lying.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.926
Silence, Brandt!

22:54.240 --> 22:56.004
You saw the boy!

22:56.640 --> 22:58.210
He's in no condition.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.643
Court is adjourned.

23:02.800 --> 23:03.961
Till tomorrow.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.801
7 o'clock.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.201
Go to Marin, make sure she's all right.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.283
I have to talk to the Meermans.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.923
So that's what you were playing with.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.928
Seigneur, please wait!

23:49.840 --> 23:51.251
Johannes has sold your sugar.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.847
Not all of it,
but a substantial amount.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.244
Where did you get that?
Put it away.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.845
It's me, isn't it?

24:00.520 --> 24:02.648
Did Agnes commission a cabinet
of your home?

24:02.720 --> 24:04.688
A cannonball would do less damage
to my marriage

24:04.760 --> 24:06.091
than those cursed miniatures.

24:06.560 --> 24:07.971
What else did the Miniaturist send you?

24:08.040 --> 24:09.883
Evil hints and vile mockery.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.724
It's the truth, Agnes kept saying.
It's the truth.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.130
So I had her cabinet burnt

24:16.200 --> 24:18.601
and I went to the Kalverstraat
to have the Miniaturist arrested.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.648
The spying little villain fled.

24:22.840 --> 24:23.841
1,000 guilders?

24:25.160 --> 24:27.731
You think you can buy my silence
with 1,000 guilders

24:27.800 --> 24:30.690
when hundreds of thousands
could have been made?

24:31.840 --> 24:34.127
My future's been ruined
because of your husband's neglect!

24:34.280 --> 24:36.487
If he is released he can sell more!

24:37.120 --> 24:40.602
There are already buyers.
- I need money, not promises.

24:40.880 --> 24:41.881
Seigneur!

24:42.240 --> 24:43.730
It is time for this to end.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.970
We both know it's not about
the money or the English boy.

24:47.040 --> 24:49.008
You think Johannes ruined your life.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.610
I know about you and Marin,
I understand your wife might be jealous.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.364
Keep your vicious
imagination to yourself!

24:54.680 --> 24:55.727
It wasn't him!

24:55.840 --> 24:57.285
It wasn't his idea.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.285
What do you mean?

25:02.200 --> 25:04.521
It was not Johannes who refused you.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.531
It was Mario's decision.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.129
But she did not want to hurt you,
so he agreed to take the blame.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.600
You lie.

25:14.760 --> 25:18.162
You lie to save his neck.
- If you don't believe me, ask her.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.840
Feel it. It's beating so fast!

25:27.160 --> 25:28.605
Her waters. It's starting.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.489
We have to fetch a midwife.
- No!

25:30.880 --> 25:32.723
Marin, we can buy her silence.

25:32.800 --> 25:35.371
We don't even have money
for firewood.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.521
We have enough.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.524
I just need you and Cornelia.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.606
I saw my siblings born.
I think I know what we need.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.882
Clean cloths, hot water
and fresh sheets.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.924
And a knife for the cord.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.450
Marin, when the pain was bad
my mother used to pace.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.284
Now, please, I need you to stand.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.766
It's coming!

26:02.560 --> 26:03.561
Marin...

26:04.360 --> 26:05.361
Cornelia!

26:08.520 --> 26:09.521
No!

26:13.440 --> 26:14.521
I can see it.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.685
Marin, it's time to push.

26:18.480 --> 26:19.686
I can't!

26:20.280 --> 26:22.567
Marin, please.
One more try, you're almost there.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.041
Oh, Marin!

26:32.120 --> 26:32.962
You did it.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.567
A little girl!

26:35.040 --> 26:36.371
It's a little girl!

26:38.760 --> 26:40.000
You did it, Marin.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.285
What's wrong with it?

26:55.040 --> 26:57.122
What's... What's wrong with her?

27:19.840 --> 27:20.841
Thea.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.771
Her name is Thea.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.930
Eight... Eight bells.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.327
Johannes' trial started at 7.
I have to go!

27:48.520 --> 27:50.204
You can't leave me, Madame.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.562
I don't know what to do and Marin...

27:54.200 --> 27:55.486
Find Smit's list.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.688
Bring a midwife or wet nurse.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.966
Someone who understands
what's happening here.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.570
But Madame, the child.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.484
Give the woman whatever it takes
to keep her quiet.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.724
If there isn't enough in Johannes' chest,
sell the silver.

28:15.040 --> 28:19.011
Did Agnes Meermans testify?
- About <i>7</i> o'clock, Madame.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.802
Trembling and strange, she was.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.281
The Schout grew angry

28:23.360 --> 28:25.727
when she would not tell him
what he wanted.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.849
Seigneur Meermans,

28:33.760 --> 28:38.209
your wife's reluctance
to enter into details is understandable.

28:38.920 --> 28:42.288
But I must ask you
to be more forthright.

28:43.560 --> 28:47.849
Now, you have known Johannes Brandt
for many years.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.445
Is that correct?

28:50.000 --> 28:51.968
We worked together as young men.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.486
What kind of a man
did you find him to be?

28:56.480 --> 28:57.811
Astute enough.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.846
But always too prone
to admire his own philosophies

29:00.920 --> 29:02.570
and disdain those of other men.

29:02.960 --> 29:06.169
He was engaged in selling
your stock of sugar.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.682
Were you satisfied
with his conduct of the business?

29:14.000 --> 29:15.843
Yes, I was.
- Lies.

29:16.760 --> 29:20.685
So there's no reason for you to bear
any animosity towards him.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.246
None whatsoever.

29:22.680 --> 29:25.286
So you would say that up till now...

29:25.840 --> 29:30.209
he has been a good merchant,
and a good man.

29:31.960 --> 29:33.803
You are under oath.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.685
Good merchant perhaps, but...

29:36.160 --> 29:39.528
Johannes Brandt has always pursued
his will or his desires...

29:40.760 --> 29:42.569
with unbending insistence.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.320
I did not realise
the depth of his defiance.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.240
The merchants he bribed,
the debts he grew...

29:49.440 --> 29:51.408
Who are these men?
Show them to me.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.130
You know full well who they are, Johannes.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.649
It's for your soul I'm here today.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.049
God has spoken to me.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.164
He's told me my silence
is no longer enough.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.091
Seigneur Meermans...

30:05.080 --> 30:07.162
Tell us what you witnessed

30:07.400 --> 30:10.051
when you came to check your sugar.

30:11.080 --> 30:15.369
As we walked towards
the warehouse doors we heard voices.

30:15.520 --> 30:18.251
When we went round to the back,

30:18.720 --> 30:21.200
Seigneur Brandt
had pushed a young man

30:21.280 --> 30:23.282
against the side of the building.

30:24.160 --> 30:27.323
The boy's face
was up against the brickwork.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.847
Both their britches
were round their ankles,

30:30.040 --> 30:31.201
their hats knocked off...

30:31.800 --> 30:33.723
Is that young man
in court now?

30:39.080 --> 30:40.286
I could...

30:41.840 --> 30:44.207
I could see the lust
in Brandt's eyes.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.121
He...

30:50.280 --> 30:52.647
He scooped up his britches
as we approached and...

30:52.720 --> 30:54.882
He beat him, didn't he?

30:55.320 --> 30:59.006
Frans, you don't have to do this.
- Rapidly and ferociously!

30:59.280 --> 31:00.327
Frans!

31:00.800 --> 31:02.325
He stabbed him deep,

31:02.400 --> 31:03.447
close to the heart.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.888
Just as the victim testified. Didn't he?

31:07.920 --> 31:09.251
Didn't he?

31:13.600 --> 31:14.601
Yes.

31:22.320 --> 31:27.008
Witness has testified
to the truth of the accusation.

31:28.040 --> 31:30.805
The Schepenbank
will now consider its verdict.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.960
Surely I have a right
to speak in my own defence.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.323
Come now, Brandt.
What is there you could say?

31:50.720 --> 31:52.290
Very well, then.

31:55.960 --> 31:59.806
Am I the only sinner in this room?

32:03.560 --> 32:04.641
Am I?

32:05.640 --> 32:08.928
You put on that costume
in the morning, Pieter Slabbaert,

32:09.480 --> 32:11.130
as do you, Frans Meermans,

32:11.200 --> 32:13.965
and hope that we'll be so dazzled
by your robes

32:14.040 --> 32:15.724
we'll overlook your own sins.

32:16.920 --> 32:20.242
I will not apologise
for who or what I am.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.081
But the allegations
against me are false.

32:24.880 --> 32:28.009
Lies, concocted out of envy...

32:28.520 --> 32:31.808
jealousy and bitterness.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.044
Citizens of Amsterdam,

32:40.280 --> 32:41.964
we are better than this.

32:43.400 --> 32:46.882
I have worked for this city
from the moment I was old enough.

32:47.560 --> 32:51.610
Sailed to lands I never knew existed,
not even in my dreams.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.930
I've fought for and seen men die
for this Republic

32:57.000 --> 32:59.002
on hot beaches and high seas,

32:59.080 --> 33:03.005
risking our lives for the glory
of the land that gave us birth.

33:03.120 --> 33:07.842
Striving, building,
never once resting in complacency.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.041
I rescued...

33:12.080 --> 33:13.764
a slave boy from traders.

33:13.840 --> 33:17.765
I took in an orphaned girl,
I sponsored apprentice after apprentice,

33:17.840 --> 33:19.683
but exploited no man's need.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.764
I never perjured myself
or corrupted another with bribes.

33:22.840 --> 33:26.481
I took a wife...
I've tried to make her happy...

33:27.880 --> 33:29.166
as she made me.

33:30.840 --> 33:31.921
And my reward...

33:35.600 --> 33:36.681
is this.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.761
Well...

33:41.960 --> 33:43.041
Enough.

33:44.680 --> 33:47.490
The purpose of a trial
is to discover the truth,

33:48.600 --> 33:50.250
and you deserve no less.

33:51.680 --> 33:54.365
So I will give it to you, in full.

33:58.560 --> 33:59.607
Yes...

34:02.800 --> 34:04.450
I know Jack Philips.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.204
Perhaps I even loved him.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.766
But I never hurt him,
nor offered any insult to his body.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.884
Frans Meermans
I once considered a friend.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.643
But long ago,
I caused him great pain and he...

34:19.280 --> 34:22.204
perhaps rightly, has never forgiven me.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.328
If the story he has told here
is his manner of revenge,

34:26.440 --> 34:27.804
it does not make it true.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.042
Nor does it prevent me
from forgiving him.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.090
Now that you have heard me,

34:47.880 --> 34:50.121
you may do with me what you will.

35:04.120 --> 35:09.081
The court must retire
to further consider its verdict.

35:14.760 --> 35:15.761
Cornelia?

35:16.160 --> 35:17.161
Marin?

35:17.480 --> 35:19.130
They couldn't agree a verdict!

35:19.360 --> 35:21.169
If we can persuade Frans to recant...

35:23.600 --> 35:24.601
What is it?

35:28.280 --> 35:29.327
Marin?

35:31.200 --> 35:32.281
No...

35:34.880 --> 35:37.087
No... It's not possible.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.569
There was nothing I could do.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.849
I'm Elisabeth Timmers.
Your maid found me in Smit's list.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.490
You told me to, Madame.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.002
She's a wet nurse, not a midwife.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.364
I've birthed four children of my own.

35:57.960 --> 35:59.928
She shouldn't be swaddled like this.

36:03.400 --> 36:04.481
Shh.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.006
Dear God.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.000
What is this?

36:12.040 --> 36:13.565
I didn't agree to this.

36:30.360 --> 36:33.409
You will be amply rewarded
for your help.

36:33.560 --> 36:34.561
A guilder a day.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.571
Four.
- Two.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.241
Three.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.201
Given the circumstances,
I'm sure you'll agree.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.081
We are going to keep Thea, aren't we?

36:54.680 --> 36:57.923
We're already bribing new people
to keep our latest secret.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.405
How will this ever stop?

37:05.680 --> 37:08.445
I'll die before I let anything happen
to that child.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.481
Did you know?

37:12.280 --> 37:13.611
About Otto and Marin.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.408
I wanted it to be Meermans'.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.247
Why?

37:29.880 --> 37:31.644
She looks peaceful, doesn't she?

37:46.080 --> 37:47.127
A map.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.126
For her travels.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.602
I've come to report a death.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.802
We have yet to announce the verdict.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.482
Not Johannes.
His sister Marin.

38:08.640 --> 38:09.926
Yesterday afternoon.

38:11.400 --> 38:15.803
Oh. A godly woman,
despite her brother.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.640
How did it happen?

38:19.160 --> 38:22.960
A fever...
She'd been ill for some time.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.804
I wondered why I hadn't seen her
the last few weeks.

38:29.080 --> 38:31.686
However, if you have come
to bury her here,

38:31.760 --> 38:33.410
I'm afraid that is impossible.

38:35.120 --> 38:36.121
Why?

38:36.520 --> 38:39.683
A godly woman, you said so yourself.
- You know why.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.284
Johannes is innocent,
but even if he were not...

38:43.360 --> 38:45.840
The men at St Anthonis will help you,
I have no room.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.491
I will not have her buried
beyond the city walls!

38:50.280 --> 38:53.250
She was a woman of Amsterdam.
She worshipped here.

38:55.440 --> 38:58.250
You have a duty to bury her.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.528
Not for myself, you understand.

39:23.480 --> 39:26.802
There is a small space
in the east corner of the church.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.041
Room for a modest slab, no more.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.322
And the finest elm for the coffin.

39:34.240 --> 39:37.084
On the slab,
do you wish for an epitaph?

39:42.080 --> 39:43.650
"Things can change."

39:46.480 --> 39:48.084
Johannes Brandt,

39:49.120 --> 39:51.600
you are charged
on three counts.

39:52.360 --> 39:57.366
On the first, that of the assault
on the boy Jack Philips,

39:57.760 --> 40:02.641
I, Pieter Slabbaert,
Schout of Amsterdam,

40:03.480 --> 40:07.769
and these four members
of the city Schepenbank,

40:08.160 --> 40:11.448
find you not guilty.

40:13.320 --> 40:14.924
And on the second count,

40:15.840 --> 40:17.285
attempted bribery,

40:18.640 --> 40:19.846
we find you...

40:20.800 --> 40:22.165
not guilty.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.041
And finally,

40:25.600 --> 40:27.762
on the charge of sodomy,

40:29.400 --> 40:31.323
the court finds you...

40:32.240 --> 40:34.322
guilty as charged.

40:39.520 --> 40:44.606
Your punishment shall be
to be weighted down at the neck

40:45.640 --> 40:49.247
and to be drowned in the sea
this Sunday.

40:49.840 --> 40:53.640
And may God have mercy
on your sinning soul.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.530
I mean you no harm,
I just need to know...

41:31.560 --> 41:33.608
I am done with you.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.446
Do you hear?

41:35.880 --> 41:37.291
I have had enough!

43:14.160 --> 43:15.207
Peebo!

43:25.440 --> 43:28.125
He came in through the window.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.209
I thought you were a ghost.

43:33.040 --> 43:34.326
Or a sorceress.

43:35.480 --> 43:37.721
You were angry with me.

43:38.760 --> 43:40.967
I heard you downstairs.
- Please.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.602
You have the answers,
I know you do.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.042
I have to save my husband.

43:48.640 --> 43:49.766
How?

43:51.400 --> 43:53.448
How do I save him from this?

43:55.680 --> 43:59.924
I'll pay you whatever it takes!
- This is why I hide.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.926
I don't understand.
- Nobody does.

44:05.480 --> 44:09.804
Everyone thinks I am the one
who can tell them what to do.

44:10.600 --> 44:12.250
That I have a third eye.

44:13.240 --> 44:19.327
I am just a maker of small things.
- No. Mario's baby. You knew.

44:19.480 --> 44:21.767
I knew because I have eyes.

44:22.120 --> 44:26.569
The woman, I saw how she walked,
how she bound her breasts.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.410
The sugar in Agnes' hand.

44:29.040 --> 44:31.771
It went black, like the Meermans'.
- Because it was real sugar.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.126
The cradle!

44:34.000 --> 44:36.048
There's no way you could've known
what Marin would order.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.401
Neither did she.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.404
She saw what I had made

44:39.480 --> 44:41.881
and she liked it enough
to order a copy.

44:42.720 --> 44:43.846
Rezeki.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.605
The dog.

44:45.880 --> 44:47.769
The wound.
There's no way you could've known!

44:48.080 --> 44:50.048
There's no way
anybody could've known!

44:54.400 --> 44:55.890
<i>Sometimes...</i>

44:57.600 --> 45:00.524
things come into my head.

45:01.480 --> 45:06.042
It's like a voice you hear
carried on the winds

45:06.120 --> 45:08.521
that you can't make out.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.966
It's just a word here or there.

45:13.720 --> 45:17.520
It's things... people.

45:19.400 --> 45:22.165
Sometimes dogs.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.891
Everyone wants answers,
but I have none.

45:31.080 --> 45:32.241
Sorry.

45:32.880 --> 45:36.089
I know it is not what you want to hear.

45:36.680 --> 45:39.809
You should take him back.
He would not like the journey to Bruges.

45:40.200 --> 45:41.281
You're leaving?

45:41.600 --> 45:43.090
Tonight, with my father.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.929
But you wrote me notes.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.049
So many of them.

45:50.280 --> 45:51.361
Please.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.246
You have to help me.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.889
My father...

46:00.880 --> 46:03.850
tried to teach me to make clocks,

46:05.080 --> 46:08.368
but the ones I made
would never keep time.

46:09.440 --> 46:12.683
They would either tick too slow
or too fast.

46:14.120 --> 46:18.045
I would take them to him
and he would make them perfect.

46:19.120 --> 46:23.603
Eventually I said to him,
"Please, I beg you,

46:24.360 --> 46:27.728
teach me what you do
to make the clocks keep time."

46:29.000 --> 46:30.604
He laughed and said,

46:31.680 --> 46:34.729
"I haven't done anything
for months now,

46:35.840 --> 46:38.491
your clocks
keep better time than mine."

46:41.200 --> 46:44.204
You had learned how to do it
without even knowing it.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.602
Things can change.

46:49.320 --> 46:50.446
Yes.

46:51.520 --> 46:55.161
But they have already changed
because of things you've done.

47:37.480 --> 47:38.527
Nella.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.005
So good to see you.

47:45.480 --> 47:47.528
But you wore your own clothes.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.762
I'm not ashamed to be here.

47:52.520 --> 47:54.807
Nor can they make me
ashamed of you.

47:55.920 --> 47:58.048
Tell me, how are you?
How's Marin?

48:00.720 --> 48:01.801
Oh...

48:03.440 --> 48:04.487
You know...

48:05.720 --> 48:07.370
Too many herring dinners?

48:09.640 --> 48:11.244
Tell her not to come.

48:12.760 --> 48:14.603
Don't think I could bear it.

48:17.040 --> 48:18.166
Come now.

48:20.880 --> 48:22.928
Drench me with your tears.

48:24.240 --> 48:26.083
Did you bring my best clothes?

48:47.160 --> 48:48.161
<i>Nella...</i>

48:52.160 --> 48:53.321
I mean it.

48:55.760 --> 48:57.091
Don't be sad.

48:59.480 --> 49:00.891
The secret in life,

49:02.120 --> 49:04.851
as in business,
is not to care too much.

49:06.240 --> 49:08.163
Always be prepared to lose.

49:16.440 --> 49:18.647
How much did you give him this time?

49:19.320 --> 49:20.560
Five guilders.

49:24.360 --> 49:25.441
To stay.

49:26.840 --> 49:28.001
Until dawn.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.843
The Lord is my shepherd

50:00.160 --> 50:01.764
I shall not want

50:02.760 --> 50:05.684
He made me to lie down
in green pastures

50:06.640 --> 50:09.291
He leaded me
beside the still waters

50:10.200 --> 50:11.850
He restored my soul

50:12.720 --> 50:16.611
He leaded me in the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake

50:18.280 --> 50:21.124
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

50:21.200 --> 50:22.884
I will fear no evil

50:23.440 --> 50:24.885
For thou art with me

50:25.360 --> 50:27.966
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me

50:28.600 --> 50:30.409
Thou preparest a table
in front of me

50:30.480 --> 50:32.050
In the presence of mine enemies

50:32.600 --> 50:34.523
Thou annointest my head with oil

50:35.160 --> 50:36.764
My cup runneth over

50:37.840 --> 50:41.287
Surely goodness and mercy
will follow me all the clays of my life

50:42.240 --> 50:45.005
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

51:37.840 --> 51:40.002
He was one of our best merchants.

51:40.440 --> 51:41.646
What fools!

51:42.160 --> 51:44.447
This will win the Burgomasters no friends.

52:02.320 --> 52:03.481
Otto...

52:05.000 --> 52:06.240
He's gone.

52:08.600 --> 52:09.965
He's really gone.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.010
Let's go home.

52:52.720 --> 52:54.006
Cornelia, I...

52:55.640 --> 52:57.483
I was going to write.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.524
Cornelia, bring her down.

53:38.480 --> 53:39.845
She's a girl!

53:44.480 --> 53:45.720
What's it called?

53:46.720 --> 53:48.245
Her name is Thea.

53:49.440 --> 53:51.169
Marin said it'd be a boy.

53:57.080 --> 53:58.366
Where is she?

54:05.560 --> 54:06.766
Where is Marin?

54:12.040 --> 54:13.690
I'm sorry, Otto.

54:16.720 --> 54:18.245
Truly, I'm so sorry.

54:20.320 --> 54:23.244
She worsened so quickly
there was nothing we could do.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.649
But you saved the child.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.528
She gave her life for this one.

54:38.600 --> 54:41.285
That's why I had to come back,
because I had to see what he...

54:43.800 --> 54:45.245
what she would be.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.205
You can do this.
