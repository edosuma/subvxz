00:12.200 --> 00:13.467
Narrator: Coming up,

00:13.467 --> 00:15.567
why is Sal punching his way
out of a paper bag?

00:17.900 --> 00:20.200
What's got Q
breaking the ice?

00:20.200 --> 00:22.400
I just love to suck ice pops
all day long.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.700
And which losing joker

00:24.700 --> 00:27.433
will sink his teeth
into tonight's big punishment?

00:29.500 --> 00:32.400
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.600
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:35.167 --> 00:36.867
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:38.433 --> 00:41.533
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:41.533 --> 00:43.000
Joe: Larry!

00:47.433 --> 00:48.933
Today,
we're working at Carvel,

00:48.933 --> 00:50.700
and it is a perfect day
for ice cream.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.800
While working
behind the counter,

00:51.800 --> 00:52.767
we'll have to do and say

00:52.767 --> 00:54.033
whatever the other
guys tell us.

00:54.033 --> 00:56.200
If you refuse to do
or say anything, you lose.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.533
Q: It's gonna be
a whale of a time!

00:57.533 --> 00:58.733
Oh, Q.

00:58.733 --> 00:59.767
-Aw, Q.
-Q.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.333
Joe:
I've heard it's been pronounced
wrong all these years.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.133
What?
Guys, it's pronounced
"ass cream."

01:08.133 --> 01:09.633
Oh, ass cream!
Ass cream.

01:09.633 --> 01:10.767
Yeah, not ice cream.

01:10.767 --> 01:11.767
Yeah, sure it is.

01:11.767 --> 01:12.833
Q: Ass cream.

01:14.067 --> 01:16.333
It's hot out there today,
right?

01:16.333 --> 01:17.533
Perfect day
for ass cream.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.167
Perfect day...

01:20.300 --> 01:22.333
Perfect day
for ass cream.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.233
Can I try
the chocolate hazelnut?

01:27.233 --> 01:28.333
Ass cream.

01:28.333 --> 01:29.833
Chocolate hazelnut?

01:29.833 --> 01:32.467
Ass cream

01:32.467 --> 01:33.433
There she goes.
Now she got it.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.333
Yeah. But,
just one ass cream?

01:38.900 --> 01:41.633
Can I get you both
a set of ass creams?
Woman: No, I'm good.

01:41.633 --> 01:42.867
Oh, you don't yet.
So, let me know.

01:42.867 --> 01:44.067
I'll make this ass cream.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.267
I'll come back to you
for your ass cream.

01:46.467 --> 01:48.067
You want ice?

01:51.433 --> 01:52.667
These two are to go?

01:54.567 --> 01:56.600
Q: Sal, punch a hole
in the bottom of the bag.

02:00.633 --> 02:02.200
Now, put the stuff in.
Now, put the stuff in.

02:06.833 --> 02:07.933
Look at the guy.

02:15.133 --> 02:16.633
Can I get a new bag?
Sal: Oh, sure.

02:16.633 --> 02:18.133
Punch a hole
in this new bag too, buddy.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.967
Murr: He just handed him
an empty bag.

02:28.967 --> 02:30.167
What'd you do?

02:31.633 --> 02:33.833
He needs a bigger bag,
clearly.
Oh, of course.

02:33.833 --> 02:36.967
You know, what you probably
needed a bigger bag.

02:39.467 --> 02:40.633
What would you like?

02:41.633 --> 02:43.267
Murr:
This kid wants sprinkles.

02:43.267 --> 02:45.667
Count out 50 sprinkles
exactly.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.633
Sal: You wanted the junior
with rainbow, right?

02:47.633 --> 02:49.367
That's 50 sprinkles.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.800
One.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
Two.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.100
Three.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.133
Four.

02:58.133 --> 02:59.267
Joe: There's been
a sprinkle shortage.

02:59.267 --> 03:00.967
There's been
a sprinkle shortage,

03:00.967 --> 03:03.167
and we have people
that use 'em too liberally.
Oh.

03:03.167 --> 03:04.433
So, now they want
exact counts for them.

03:04.433 --> 03:05.700
13.

03:07.067 --> 03:08.133
18.

03:08.133 --> 03:09.467
They want me to count out
by -- by hand.

03:09.467 --> 03:11.067
It'll go a lot quicker
if we don't talk.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.267
Joe: Oh, that's enough.
Dump 'em all.

03:16.267 --> 03:18.200
Oh, my God.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.100
Let me say one thing.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.300
Let me just
say one thing.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.900
You two gentlemen...
You two gentlemen...

03:24.900 --> 03:25.933
...made a beautiful child.

03:25.933 --> 03:27.967
...made a be--

03:27.967 --> 03:29.900
made a beautiful child.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.767
Murr:
I can't believe he said it!

03:32.767 --> 03:34.700
Okay, guys,
time for a delivery.
All right.

03:36.833 --> 03:38.167
Murr:

03:38.167 --> 03:40.233
* For he's
a jolly good fellow *

03:40.233 --> 03:42.800
* For he's
a jolly good fellow *

03:42.800 --> 03:45.833
* For he's
a jolly good fellow *

03:45.833 --> 03:48.200
* Which nobody can deny

03:48.200 --> 03:50.533
All right, Sal!

03:51.800 --> 03:53.600
Look at his big fat face.
Q:

03:55.067 --> 03:56.567
Joe:
You're punching yourself!

03:56.567 --> 03:57.700
It's frozen, you dope!

04:05.233 --> 04:08.067
Welcome to Carvel.
What can I do for you?

04:08.067 --> 04:09.733
Joey, keep getting distracted
by your own hand.

04:09.733 --> 04:12.733
You want to soften up...

04:12.733 --> 04:14.067
Huh?

04:17.633 --> 04:19.167
Look, look, look,
look, look.

04:19.167 --> 04:20.400
Q: He looks so stupid.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.500
This one.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.633
No, no, no.
Look, look, look.

04:23.633 --> 04:25.233
See right here?

04:26.233 --> 04:27.333
This one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:29.267 --> 04:31.933
So, that one's $5.45,
and $5.45?

04:31.933 --> 04:34.367
Just slap the register
with your hands.

04:34.367 --> 04:36.333
Like, just palm it.

04:40.867 --> 04:42.400
$10.90 for them both.

04:45.933 --> 04:47.400
Sal: Look at his face.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.100
Hey, bud, how are you?

04:53.200 --> 04:55.633
Small vanilla with
chocolate syrup.
You got it.

04:55.633 --> 04:57.267
Joe, keep touching
the ice cream by accident

04:57.267 --> 04:59.067
with your nose.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.300
Did you want
the hot fudge?

05:01.667 --> 05:03.700
It's all right, man.
Sorry, no. I'm sorry.

05:03.700 --> 05:04.867
You know what?
I'll do a bigger --

05:04.867 --> 05:05.833
I'll do the bigger cup.

05:05.833 --> 05:07.633
Joe, hit your nose
on it again.

05:07.633 --> 05:09.500
Okay, so that's it.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
Ah! Ah! Oh!

05:11.500 --> 05:12.900
Oh, that's on me.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.600
Murr: You got to get him
another one, Joe!

05:14.600 --> 05:16.067
That's on me.
That's my bad.

05:16.067 --> 05:17.900
Let me get you
a bigger cup.

05:19.733 --> 05:22.333
Sal: Slam your face into it
on the table.

05:22.333 --> 05:24.067
Oh! Oh!

05:25.933 --> 05:27.300
That's my bad.
Let me get a bigger cup.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.967
Joe, go in the back
and grab a bucket.

05:38.133 --> 05:39.367
Chocolate syrup.

05:39.367 --> 05:42.500
Joe, get your head
in that bucket!

05:42.500 --> 05:45.167
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

05:46.067 --> 05:47.100
Oh, oh, oh, man!

05:47.100 --> 05:48.500
That's on me!

05:50.400 --> 05:53.600
It's a perfect day
for ice cream, isn't it?

05:53.600 --> 05:54.800
Right on.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.433
That's a straight-up
tight-ass perm right there.

05:59.633 --> 06:02.067
I tell you.
That is a stra--

06:05.467 --> 06:07.500
That is a straight-up,
tight-ass perm right there.

06:09.767 --> 06:10.933
Joe: I'm talking
hashtag permanant!

06:10.933 --> 06:14.067
Hashtag permanent!

06:14.067 --> 06:15.367
It's all-natural.
It's all

06:15.367 --> 06:16.733
It looks fantastic.

06:17.967 --> 06:20.133
I want a soft vanilla
with rainbow sprinkles.

06:20.133 --> 06:21.767
Soft vanilla with
rainbow sprinkles --
you got it.

06:21.767 --> 06:23.900
Soft vanilla was my nickname
in college.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.533
So--

06:28.167 --> 06:30.300
Soft vanilla was my nickname
in college.

06:31.533 --> 06:33.200
Tight-ass perm.

06:35.633 --> 06:37.067
How can I help you out?

06:39.233 --> 06:40.167
You want me to write it
on the cake?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.333
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-Sure.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.767
All right, no problem.
I'll go do it right now.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.433
What are you gonna
make it say?
Congrats, you big baby?

06:45.433 --> 06:46.467
That's better.
How's that?

06:50.833 --> 06:52.333
Okay, so here we go.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.733
Uh, "Congrats, you big baby"
right?

06:57.167 --> 06:58.367
What did you say?

06:59.700 --> 07:01.167
Joe: Oh!

07:01.167 --> 07:02.600
No problem, no problem,
we'll fix it, we'll fix it.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.167
"Congrats on
your baby boy."
You ready, Murr?

07:05.167 --> 07:07.200
Congrats on
your big-ass baby.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.567
Here we go,
here we go, okay.

07:12.567 --> 07:15.800
Uh, "Congrats on
your big-ass baby."

07:24.267 --> 07:26.067
You had it easy
out there, pal.

07:26.067 --> 07:27.633
What are you
talking about?

07:27.633 --> 07:29.767
I did not!
You go out for my turn.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.200
One turn.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.300
If I don't get you,

07:32.300 --> 07:34.233
I'll take a loss
for the whole episode.

07:34.233 --> 07:35.433
But I'm gonna go hard
on you.

07:35.433 --> 07:36.900
I'm gonna go hard
on you.
Whole episode?

07:36.900 --> 07:38.400
Whole -- I'll take
an automatic loss.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.900
Fine, you're on.
Let's do it.

07:39.900 --> 07:40.900
All right.
I'm going out!

07:40.900 --> 07:42.100
All right.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.067
Joe: Back at the scene.

07:44.067 --> 07:46.633
You just made
a serious mistake.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.700
Murr: Hello, sir.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.967
Let me guess.
Chocolate.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.233
I just lost.

07:55.233 --> 07:57.500
Q: Wow!

07:57.500 --> 07:58.900
Narrator: Murr froze up,

07:58.900 --> 08:01.800
so he's being soft-served
onto the loser board.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.067
Today, we're in the park
with all my dogs.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.667
We're each gonna take
a Gatto pup,

08:05.667 --> 08:06.800
go up to a stranger,

08:06.800 --> 08:08.300
and ask him
to watch our dog for us.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.367
The catch is,

08:09.367 --> 08:10.467
we're not gonna use
the dog's real name.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.167
We're gonna give
a name and back story

08:12.167 --> 08:13.900
that's been fed to us
by the other guys.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.933
Once somebody agrees
to watch the dog,

08:15.933 --> 08:18.567
one of us will approach
and then ask about the dog.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.233
If you can't get the stranger
to repeat the name

08:20.233 --> 08:22.367
and weird back story,
you lose.

08:22.367 --> 08:23.567
Sit!

08:25.733 --> 08:27.167
Stay.

08:30.233 --> 08:31.867
Sal: All right, Q, let's go.
Here we go!

08:31.867 --> 08:33.633
I assigned the dogs to you,
my friends,

08:33.633 --> 08:35.167
on, you know,
personality or look.

08:35.167 --> 08:38.067
Mishkeen and Q
are dead ringers.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.600
They say that all owners
look like their dogs.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.400
What is that?
That's Mishkeen!

08:46.067 --> 08:47.700
That's not your dog
right now.
Look at Q!

08:47.700 --> 08:49.867
Is that Q making that sound
or the dog?
No, it's the dog!

08:49.867 --> 08:52.067
Murr:
The dog's doing that?

08:53.633 --> 08:55.967
Sounds like somebody's
letting the air out of him.

08:55.967 --> 08:58.067
Q:
All right, buddy, okay.
I got to go now, too.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.800
Would you actually mind
watching him for a second

08:59.800 --> 09:01.767
while I run to the bathroom?

09:01.767 --> 09:03.067
Thank you.
His name is, uh...

09:03.067 --> 09:04.733
Joe: His name's Ice Pops.
...Ice Pops.

09:04.733 --> 09:06.667
'Cause I love to suck ice pops
all day long.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.867
I just love to suck ice pops
all day long.

09:11.267 --> 09:12.600
Okay, I'm gonna run to
the men's room right there.

09:16.767 --> 09:18.500
Oh, he's adorable!
What's his name?

09:18.500 --> 09:19.933
Well,
his name is Mishkeen,

09:19.933 --> 09:21.633
because I just
looked at the tag.

09:26.367 --> 09:27.600
Ice Pops?

09:35.167 --> 09:36.533
Why did he name him
Ice Pops?

09:40.500 --> 09:42.200
All right, well,
you got an adorable dog.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.933
Oh, I'm gonna go back in there
and take care of that.
Go ahead.

09:43.933 --> 09:45.367
Take care, guys.
Have a good day, okay?

09:45.367 --> 09:46.667
We're gonna send Q
back in.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.467
Ice Pops!

09:50.467 --> 09:52.800
Thank you so much
for watching him.
Good doggie!

09:52.800 --> 09:54.667
Okay, thank you,
Mishkeen.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.533
That was my old dog
that died.

09:56.533 --> 09:58.200
Oh, no!
I know, horribly.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.300
They were brothers,
so I put Mishkeen's on Ice Pop.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.300
Aw.
Yeah, I know.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.867
I'm not so weird
after all.

10:05.900 --> 10:06.867
All right, thank you!

10:10.367 --> 10:12.433
I got Biscotti,
the fat angry one.

10:12.433 --> 10:13.800
She's also
the leader of the pack,

10:13.800 --> 10:15.233
so she stands up
for the other ones.

10:15.233 --> 10:17.167
It's like with you guys.

10:18.533 --> 10:20.133
Come on, puppy.
Good girl.

10:20.133 --> 10:22.267
Come on. Come on.
Good girl.

10:22.267 --> 10:23.433
Hi, sorry to bother you.

10:23.433 --> 10:24.533
I have to use the restroom.

10:24.533 --> 10:26.033
Would you mind watching my dog
real quick?

10:26.033 --> 10:27.433
I know I can't
take her over there.

10:27.433 --> 10:28.533
Oh.
Yes.

10:28.533 --> 10:29.733
Are you guys gonna be here
for a minute, or no?

10:29.733 --> 10:31.133
Is that cool?

10:31.133 --> 10:32.300
Thank you so much,
I appreciate it.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.567
Yeah, her name is, uh...

10:33.567 --> 10:34.767
Biscotti.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.067
Her name is Biscotti.

10:36.067 --> 10:38.500
I named her that because I'm
an unhealthy fat bastard

10:38.500 --> 10:40.233
that lives and dies
by pastry.

10:40.233 --> 10:42.400
I named her that because
I'm an un--

10:42.400 --> 10:45.667
I'm an unhealthy fat bastard
that lives and dies by pastry.

10:48.633 --> 10:49.867
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna run
to the restroom.

10:49.867 --> 10:50.833
Okay.

10:50.833 --> 10:52.067
There's no way
the guy's saying it.

10:52.067 --> 10:53.067
There's no way.

10:53.067 --> 10:54.467
Sons of bitches.

10:58.933 --> 11:00.300
Sal: Hi.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.067
What's, uh,
what's his name?

11:03.567 --> 11:05.467
Oh, you're dog sitting?

11:05.467 --> 11:07.067
Well, what was the name?

11:08.067 --> 11:09.133
All: Biscotti!

11:09.133 --> 11:11.733
That's funny.
That's a cute name for a dog.

11:11.733 --> 11:13.100
Kind of wonder why
he named it that?

11:18.467 --> 11:19.933
Was he a portly man,
or...

11:20.967 --> 11:22.233
Stocky fella?

11:23.433 --> 11:24.500
Bigger than you.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.533
Was he, like,
an unhealthy, fat bastard?

11:25.533 --> 11:27.067
No.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.167
Done.
It's a loss.

11:29.167 --> 11:31.567
Daddy's back.
Hi, Biscotti.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.900
Hi, baby.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.367
I ran as fast as I could,

11:34.367 --> 11:36.300
but I'm such an unhealthy
fat bastard

11:36.300 --> 11:37.933
that lives and dies
by pastry.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.067
Cannoli, come on,
this way!

11:41.067 --> 11:42.367
Q: How did Murray
get Cannoli?

11:42.367 --> 11:43.700
Well, we went with
what people look like.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.467
Like, Cannoli has
the smallest head.

11:45.467 --> 11:48.133
Murray's got
the smallest head of us.
Without a doubt.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.267
Okay, here we go.

11:49.267 --> 11:51.600
Sir, do you know -- is there
a men's room around?

11:52.933 --> 11:53.900
Yeah, I see it over there.

11:53.900 --> 11:54.933
I don't want to take him
in the --

11:54.933 --> 11:56.433
white dogs are problematic
with...

11:56.433 --> 11:57.433
Do you mind?

11:57.433 --> 11:59.133
He just asked,
"can I watch the dog?"

11:59.133 --> 12:01.300
Thank you so, so much.
I really appreciate it.
I'll be right back.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.800
It's name is Hennessy.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.067
My dog's name
is Hennessy.

12:04.067 --> 12:05.367
I named him that
'cause I use him

12:05.367 --> 12:06.833
to hit on
smokin' hot black chicks.

12:06.833 --> 12:07.833
I named him that...

12:08.833 --> 12:10.633
I named him that
'cause I use him

12:10.633 --> 12:12.667
to hit on
smokin' hot black chicks.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.733
I'll be right back,
okay?

12:15.733 --> 12:17.067
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.867
Okay, Hennessy,
I'll be right back. Bye.

12:18.867 --> 12:20.233
I feel good.

12:20.233 --> 12:22.533
I'm just gonna go for
a walk in the park

12:22.533 --> 12:24.400
and check the facts
on this dog.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.400
There's no way that guy
is gonna repeat that.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.933
I love petting dogs

12:28.933 --> 12:30.067
Joe: Oh, here goes Q.

12:30.067 --> 12:31.367
Hello, sweetheart!

12:31.367 --> 12:32.600
Oh, my God.
What's her name?

12:33.767 --> 12:34.800
Hennessy?

12:34.800 --> 12:36.100
Got one!

12:36.100 --> 12:38.300
Oh, Hennessy,
how you doin' sweetheart.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.667
What

12:41.333 --> 12:43.367
Oh. Do you know why
they named him Hennessy?

12:43.367 --> 12:45.300
You don't know.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.333
No! Come on!

12:47.733 --> 12:49.200
Quick, give me Hennessy!

12:49.200 --> 12:50.833
There's some smokin' hot
black chicks by the bathroom.

12:50.833 --> 12:53.067
Come on, Hennessy!
They love Hennessy!

12:53.067 --> 12:54.833
That's it,
they love Hennessy!

12:57.167 --> 12:58.767
This dog is yanking me.

12:58.767 --> 13:01.900
Tartufo, I gave to Sal because
Tartufo is my sexy one.

13:01.900 --> 13:05.700
It's the youngest, cutest
cotton ball with legs.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.133
Stop walking
in front of me.

13:07.133 --> 13:08.433
Also, the least trained.

13:08.433 --> 13:10.700
So, this should be fun
to watch Sal

13:10.700 --> 13:13.400
trying to control
my biggest, strongest dog.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.267
No, no, no, no, no!

13:15.267 --> 13:17.667
Sit. Sit.

13:18.833 --> 13:20.400
Okay, then just
come on this way.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.300
What an alpha-male.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.900
Come here. Come here.
Oh, good girl.

13:24.900 --> 13:27.267
Murr: Here we go.
Come on.

13:27.267 --> 13:28.533
Her name's, uh...

13:28.533 --> 13:29.667
Sluff.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.700
Sluff.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.800
I named him that
'cause it's the soe sound

13:34.800 --> 13:36.067
that his mom made
when he slid out.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.833
It was like, sluff.

13:38.833 --> 13:42.200
Wow,
that is disgusting.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.400
I'm sorry.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.433
Yeah, Sluff.

13:44.433 --> 13:45.933
I named her Sluff
'cause it was the --

13:45.933 --> 13:47.833
it was actually like,
the sound that she made

13:47.833 --> 13:49.067
when she was born.

13:49.067 --> 13:51.067
When she came out of her mom,
it was like, "sluff."

13:52.400 --> 13:54.167
I know, weird,
but, it's funny.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.600
I have to use the restroom.
Would you...

13:56.600 --> 13:57.700
Like, 30 seconds?

13:57.700 --> 13:58.700
Okay. Come here, honey.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.100
All right, so far.
There you go.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.167
Thank you so much again.

14:01.167 --> 14:02.267
Joe: All right,
let's check it out.

14:02.267 --> 14:04.233
Q: Joe's going in.

14:04.233 --> 14:05.800
How do you see
this one going?

14:05.800 --> 14:07.467
Sal: This is gonna be
a tough one, guys.

14:07.467 --> 14:08.633
So, you have to get her

14:08.633 --> 14:10.733
to talk about the sound
that dogs make...

14:10.733 --> 14:12.333
Yeah.
Onomatopoeia.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.467
Sluff is onomatopoeia.

14:13.467 --> 14:15.933
Hi! Hello!

14:15.933 --> 14:17.633
How are you!

14:17.633 --> 14:18.967
Oh, what's her name?

14:20.467 --> 14:21.633
Slurf?

14:21.633 --> 14:23.067
She's saying it,
she's saying it.

14:23.067 --> 14:24.600
Yeah, yeah,
I'm in so far.
Okay.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.600
Why -- why, uh, Slurf,
do you know?

14:28.633 --> 14:30.533
Yes!

14:30.533 --> 14:31.867
That's odd, but it's cool.

14:31.867 --> 14:34.167
Oh, wow.
Ba-ba-ba-baaaa!

14:35.533 --> 14:37.100
Narrator: Murr and Joe ran away

14:37.100 --> 14:39.067
with their tails
between their legs,

14:39.067 --> 14:40.867
making Murr
tonight's big loser.

14:40.867 --> 14:42.267
And Murr's our loser.

14:42.267 --> 14:45.667
That's it, and it has been
said by many people, buddy,

14:45.667 --> 14:47.500
that you have no soul.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.633
So today, you are going
to be playing Dracula

14:50.633 --> 14:53.867
in a local presentation of
the "Dracula's Monologues."

14:53.867 --> 14:55.267
What's the Dracula's --
there's no such play.

14:55.267 --> 14:56.667
Exactly, what's
the "Dracula's Monologues"!

14:56.667 --> 14:57.800
Don't worry, it's a role

14:57.800 --> 14:59.133
you could really sink your teeth
into, my friend.

14:59.133 --> 15:00.667
Don't worry about it.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.633
Now you're getting it.
I have to make it up?

15:02.633 --> 15:03.600
Speaking of makeup...

15:03.600 --> 15:04.900
Here we go.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.367
Go ahead.
Oh, fangs!

15:11.100 --> 15:12.400
Q: There he is.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.400
You look so stupid.

15:18.467 --> 15:19.533
And now we cut the mike

15:19.533 --> 15:20.667
and leave you to
your own devices, bye!

15:20.667 --> 15:22.067
Yeah, good luck, buddy.
See you later.

15:22.067 --> 15:23.400
No, wait, wait, wait.
Come on!

15:23.400 --> 15:25.100
Come on, don't do that!
That's not funny!

15:25.100 --> 15:26.400
Like,
I don't know what to say!

15:26.400 --> 15:28.067
Don't worry, it's just
the "Dracula Monologues."

15:28.067 --> 15:29.533
I don't know the story.

15:31.533 --> 15:32.967
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

15:32.967 --> 15:35.067
"Impractical Jokers" present
the "Dracula Monologues."

15:38.600 --> 15:40.467
* Hallelujah

15:40.467 --> 15:42.867
Oh, by the way, it's not
the "Dracula Monologues."

15:44.067 --> 15:46.467
You're in a gospel choir
as James Murray, right.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.200
And you're about to do
this performance.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.633
* Hallelujah

15:49.633 --> 15:52.267
He's got to perform
with this gospel choir right now

15:52.267 --> 15:53.367
to the best of his ability.

15:53.367 --> 15:55.167
So the choir is in on it,

15:55.167 --> 15:56.600
but the audience has no idea.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.700
Why am I Dracula?

16:00.267 --> 16:01.333
Q: Let's go, let's go!

16:04.600 --> 16:06.067
* Hallelujah

16:06.067 --> 16:08.467
Joe:
Look at his face!

16:08.467 --> 16:09.900
Yeah!

16:12.333 --> 16:14.467
Murr: I don't know.
Why am I Dracula?

16:14.467 --> 16:15.567
Just sing.

16:15.567 --> 16:18.300
* Hallelujah

16:18.300 --> 16:19.467
* Hallelujah

16:19.467 --> 16:21.067
Like, what is
the audience thinking?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.600
* Hallelujah

16:22.600 --> 16:24.267
Whoo!
* Hallelujah

16:24.267 --> 16:26.867
* Hallelujah

16:29.467 --> 16:32.100
* Oh when the saints

16:32.100 --> 16:33.700
* Go marchin' in

16:33.700 --> 16:37.500
* Oh when the saints
go marchin' in *

16:40.467 --> 16:42.233
* Oh

16:42.233 --> 16:44.833
He's like...
He's off beat!
He's off beat!

16:44.833 --> 16:46.067
He's off beat!

16:46.067 --> 16:48.433
* When the saints
go marchin' in *

16:48.433 --> 16:52.667
Murr: * You got to be
within that number *

16:52.667 --> 16:57.100
* Oh when the saints
go marchin' in *

16:57.100 --> 16:58.867
* Oh, when the saints

16:58.867 --> 17:00.200
* Wanna be, wanna be,
wanna be, wanna be *

17:00.200 --> 17:02.267
* Wanna be, wanna be
wanna be, wanna be *

17:02.267 --> 17:05.833
* Wanna be, wanna be
wanna be, wanna be *

17:05.833 --> 17:09.167
* Oh, when the saints
go marchin' in *

17:09.167 --> 17:10.900
Q: Big finish!

17:10.900 --> 17:13.733
Murr:

17:13.733 --> 17:15.800
The fun's just
getting started, buddy.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.433
Woman: * Ooh, ooh-ooh

17:18.433 --> 17:19.867
* Ooh hoo

17:19.867 --> 17:22.600
* Hoo hoo

* Ooh

17:28.567 --> 17:30.267
Q: Yes!

17:32.633 --> 17:35.067
* I remember the day

17:35.067 --> 17:36.833
* I remember the hour

17:36.833 --> 17:38.567
Oh, she's gonna testify,
James.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.933
* Early in the morning

17:40.933 --> 17:42.333
I wonder
who testifies next.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.633
* Oh, late at night

17:43.633 --> 17:45.067
No!

17:46.367 --> 17:47.733
* My troubles

17:47.733 --> 17:48.867
* No, no

17:48.867 --> 17:51.233
* No, no

17:51.233 --> 17:55.100
* Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah *

17:55.100 --> 17:56.633
Q: Uh-oh!

17:56.633 --> 17:58.300
Joe: All right, Murr,
take the center stage.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.800
* Holy

17:59.800 --> 18:00.867
Testify!

18:02.533 --> 18:04.567
Here we go.

18:04.567 --> 18:05.900
Murr: * Hoo hoo

18:09.300 --> 18:11.867
* I...

18:13.433 --> 18:14.567
Woman: Come on.

18:14.567 --> 18:18.467
* I'm a man
who is pretty strong *

18:18.467 --> 18:21.733
* I've got three friends
that done do me wrong *

18:23.067 --> 18:26.800
* Holy, holy, holy, holy

18:26.800 --> 18:28.367
He's like...

18:28.367 --> 18:32.133
* No matter what my friends

18:32.133 --> 18:36.333
* I gotta say
I kinda love them too-ey *

18:36.333 --> 18:41.067
* Holy, holy, holy, holy

18:41.067 --> 18:42.367
Now, let's speed it up!

18:43.967 --> 18:45.667

18:59.367 --> 19:01.633
Sal: What is that?

19:01.633 --> 19:03.533
What is that move?

19:03.533 --> 19:04.867
* Holy, Holy

19:04.867 --> 19:06.467
**

19:06.467 --> 19:08.800
-He's doing James Brown!
-He's doing James Brown!

19:13.100 --> 19:14.200
Woman: Yes! Yes!

19:14.200 --> 19:17.333
What am I -- what am I
watching right now?

19:17.333 --> 19:19.200
* Holy

19:19.200 --> 19:20.933
* Holy

19:20.933 --> 19:22.233
* Holy

19:22.233 --> 19:27.567
* Glory, glory, glory

19:27.567 --> 19:36.467
* To the newborn king

19:38.900 --> 19:40.767
Joe: Look!

19:48.267 --> 19:49.933
Murr, big finish!
Come on down.

20:02.700 --> 20:05.233
Murr:
Why am I Dracula?

20:06.667 --> 20:11.333
**

20:11.333 --> 20:13.467
That was insane!

20:13.467 --> 20:14.767
James Murray
just got punished,

20:14.767 --> 20:16.433
and you're watching
"Impractical Insider."

20:16.433 --> 20:17.867
We're gonna give you
a behind-the-scenes look

20:17.867 --> 20:19.067
at everything
that happened.

20:19.067 --> 20:21.033
Check this out.

20:21.033 --> 20:22.033
* Oh, when the saints

20:22.033 --> 20:23.033
* Oh, when the saints

20:23.033 --> 20:24.467
* Go marchin' in

20:24.467 --> 20:25.733
* Go marchin' in

20:25.733 --> 20:29.167
* When the saints
go marchin' in *

20:29.167 --> 20:31.167
What do you like best
about this punishment?

20:31.167 --> 20:33.000
One of my favorite things
is the, uh,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.333
when there's
such a huge switch...

20:34.333 --> 20:35.900
Uh-huh.
...that you
don't see coming.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.500
He won't see it coming
in a million years.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.533
Joe: It's not
the "Dracula's Monologues."

20:40.533 --> 20:41.700
Certain days on set,

20:41.700 --> 20:43.467
you know, like,
we're in a dingy basement,

20:43.467 --> 20:44.967
or, you know,
we're on a boat.

20:44.967 --> 20:47.467
But today, we get to hang out
in a theater

20:47.467 --> 20:49.033
and get to listen to this.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.200
* Ooh, yeah

20:50.200 --> 20:51.233
* Hallelujah

20:51.233 --> 20:52.367
* It's Murr

20:52.367 --> 20:53.467
* Hallelujah

20:53.467 --> 20:54.633
* He's gettin' punished

20:54.633 --> 20:56.200
* Hallelujah

20:56.200 --> 20:57.233
* Because he lost

20:57.233 --> 20:58.433
* Hallelujah

20:58.433 --> 20:59.767
So yeah,
we have a lot of options

20:59.767 --> 21:01.367
for the Dracula outfit.

21:01.367 --> 21:02.967
It's kind of
Dracula-inspired.

21:02.967 --> 21:04.633
It's like a crazy,
fun vampire.

21:04.633 --> 21:07.267
So, this is one
we're probably not gonna use.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.200
Whoa, this is cool.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.500
Like, that's like
a pirate one.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.933
I love this --
all this velvet.

21:10.933 --> 21:13.233
This is kind of S&M,
though,

21:13.233 --> 21:14.900
which Murr
won't like too much.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.267
And you can't use that
for a punishment.

21:16.267 --> 21:18.500
What have they told you
so far?
Nothing.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.233
Nothing, but I --
I have ascertained

21:20.233 --> 21:22.567
I'm in some kind of theater,
a school of some kind.

21:22.567 --> 21:25.433
Today, you are going to be
playing Dracula

21:25.433 --> 21:28.667
in a local presentation of
the "Dracula's Monologues."

21:28.667 --> 21:30.067
Well, at least
I'm dressed in black.

21:30.067 --> 21:32.800
Well...
Well, of course you
got to change.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.233
Of course you got to change,
you know that.

21:34.233 --> 21:35.500
Q: You think you're gonna
go dressed like this?

21:35.500 --> 21:37.133
Dracula doesn't
look like this.

21:37.133 --> 21:38.567
Well, okay,
then put a cape on me.

21:38.567 --> 21:40.200
But I'm already in costume.
Yeah, yeah.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.467
We're gonna put a cape on you
and that's it.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.533
What are your main concerns
with this punishment?

21:44.533 --> 21:45.733
Well, they're telling me

21:45.733 --> 21:47.567
I have to improvise
an entire play from scratch.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.567
Mm-hmm.
That -- that's a big
concern.

21:50.567 --> 21:53.700
So, just beyond there,
Murr is getting into makeup,

21:53.700 --> 21:55.533
and he has no idea
what's gonna happen.

21:55.533 --> 21:59.267
He really believes that
he's doing this performance.

21:59.267 --> 22:00.967
Q: You look so stupid!

22:00.967 --> 22:02.367
Like, I don't know
what to say.

22:02.367 --> 22:04.067
Joe: Don't worry, it's just
the "Dracula's Monologues."

22:04.067 --> 22:05.400
I don't know the story!

22:06.900 --> 22:08.400
So, Murr's upstairs already,

22:08.400 --> 22:11.100
and this lovely choir
is going in.

22:11.100 --> 22:13.900
* Hallelujah
Joe: You're in a gospel choir
as James Murray.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.767
You're about to do
this performance.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.067
* Hallelujah
Q: Go, let's go!

22:17.067 --> 22:18.167
Hallelujah

22:18.167 --> 22:19.800
This is all happening
right now, baby.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.233
* Hallelujah

22:21.233 --> 22:22.467
It's goin' down.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.067
* Hallelujah

22:24.067 --> 22:25.500
Whoo!
* Hallelujah

22:25.500 --> 22:27.667
* Hallelujah

22:30.167 --> 22:31.400
Let me just
clear something up.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.133
So, the whole time
you were worried, actually,

22:33.133 --> 22:34.867
about the punishment,
about what you were
gonna say and do?

22:34.867 --> 22:36.067
Yeah, I'm like,

22:36.067 --> 22:37.233
I don't know enough
about Dracula's history.

22:37.233 --> 22:38.900
I don't know --
I know some basic details,

22:38.900 --> 22:40.067
but I'm like,
how am I gonna improvise

22:40.067 --> 22:41.333
a whole play on my own?

22:41.333 --> 22:44.300
I read his whole
Wikipedia page to research.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.500
We needed to get some soul,
did you notice that?
Oh, my God.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.300
Yeah, yeah.
Your soul?

22:48.300 --> 22:50.967
Got it.
Got it, they gave me soul!

22:50.967 --> 22:52.967
Yeah.
It all makes sense now.

22:52.967 --> 22:54.533
I wish we had
one more song.

22:54.533 --> 22:56.067
Joe,
we have one more song!
Oh, we have one more!

22:56.067 --> 22:58.433
Finale, Murray!

22:58.433 --> 23:03.200
* Glory, glory,
hallelujah *

23:03.200 --> 23:07.067
* Glory, glory,
hallelujah *

23:07.067 --> 23:10.933
* Glory, glory,
hallelujah *

23:10.933 --> 23:17.267
* His truth is marching on

23:17.267 --> 23:26.733
* His truth is marching on
