WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:05.380
Now, the key to successful

00:02.586 --> 00:05.380
barbecue sauce

00:05.422 --> 00:07.967
is using just the right amount

00:05.422 --> 00:07.967
of ingredients.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.718
Little bit of salt.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.887
A tiny bit of pepper.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.139
And let's give it a try.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.139
Okay. Here we go.

00:17.309 --> 00:18.936
Not bad, not bad, but you know,

00:17.309 --> 00:18.936
I'm feeling a little

00:18.978 --> 00:21.396
wacky tonight, kids.

00:18.978 --> 00:21.396
I'm feeling little nutty.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.398
What do you say, we put

00:21.438 --> 00:23.398
in a little lemon juice, huh?

00:25.609 --> 00:27.653
Okay, lemon juice.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.822
'Lemon juice.'

00:29.864 --> 00:32.574
'Where's the lemon juice?

00:29.864 --> 00:32.574
The lemon juice.'

00:38.789 --> 00:40.081
'Where's the lemon juice?'

00:45.921 --> 00:48.423
Ah. Here it is.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.178
Just what we need.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.346
- Hi, daddy.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.223
Hi, boys.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.223
I missed you, too.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.641
Alright, now..

00:57.683 --> 01:00.352
...we're gonna add just

00:57.683 --> 01:00.352
a splash of lemon juice.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.814
Very good.

01:03.856 --> 01:06.149
And we give it

01:03.856 --> 01:06.149
a big taste. Okay.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.870
Whoo! That, uh..

01:17.912 --> 01:19.663
That brought it

01:17.912 --> 01:19.663
to life, didn't it?

01:21.707 --> 01:24.083
Uh. Hey, you wanna

01:21.707 --> 01:24.083
try some, son?

01:26.253 --> 01:28.672
How about you?

01:26.253 --> 01:28.672
You wanna try some?

01:28.714 --> 01:31.842
- Okay. More for me.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.842
- Here, daddy.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.179
Yeah, it needs a little

01:33.761 --> 01:36.179
more lemon juice. Thank you.

Hey, everybody,

02:55.092 --> 02:58.428
who's your favorite rhino?

02:58.470 --> 03:01.556
- Rigby the rhino.

03:01.598 --> 03:06.185
Rigby will be right back,

03:01.598 --> 03:06.185
so don't touch that remote!

03:08.897 --> 03:11.775
(man on TV)

03:08.897 --> 03:11.775
'Here he comes!

03:08.897 --> 03:11.775
It's Action Rigby!'

03:11.817 --> 03:13.401
'He's an action figure!'

03:13.443 --> 03:16.113
'He's a party animal!'

03:16.155 --> 03:18.657
'He's your sleepy time pal.'

03:18.699 --> 03:20.450
Good night, Rigby.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.495
We love you.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.955
(man on TV)

03:23.537 --> 03:24.955

03:36.175 --> 03:38.635
We'll see you there!

03:38.677 --> 03:40.137
You sure will.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.392
Boy, I hope

03:41.680 --> 03:45.392
my Action Rigby comes today.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.478
Yeah. We've been

03:45.433 --> 03:48.478
waiting forever.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.189
Daddy!

03:51.065 --> 03:52.900
Mail's still not here.

03:56.111 --> 03:59.322
Hey, did you order

03:56.111 --> 03:59.322
the sleepy time slumber cot?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.950
Nah. I haven't told

03:59.364 --> 04:01.950
Stephanie yet.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.869
But Rigby's getting her bed.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.708
- Hey, guys.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.708
- Good morning.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.251
Listen. I, uh,

04:09.750 --> 04:11.251
I can't go with you to see

04:11.292 --> 04:12.502
"Phantom of the Opera" tonight.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.422
Oh, come on, Joey.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.422
It's not that scary.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.591
Joey,

04:16.464 --> 04:17.591
Vicky's flying in for this.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.218
We were all

04:17.632 --> 04:19.218
gonna go out together.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.387
Hey, what can I do? My date

04:19.259 --> 04:22.387
just called and canceled.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.306
Wow, it's kinda last minute.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.306
I hope she has a good excuse.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.850
She's gettin' married.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.478
That's a good excuse.

04:30.520 --> 04:34.191
Hey, Deej, why don't you

04:30.520 --> 04:34.191
and Steve use the tickets?

04:34.233 --> 04:35.776
- Really?

04:34.233 --> 04:35.776
- 'Yeah.'

04:35.817 --> 04:37.611
Oh, I'd love to.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.320
Thank you guys so much.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.073
You know,

04:39.362 --> 04:41.073
I have the perfect dress but..

04:41.115 --> 04:42.866
I wanna do something

04:41.115 --> 04:42.866
really special with my hair.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.911
Oh, Deej, Deej. Why don't you

04:42.908 --> 04:45.911
go to my man, Alejandro.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.290
Alejandro's very exclusive.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.499
Do you think he'll take me?

04:51.541 --> 04:53.919
I'll write you

04:51.541 --> 04:53.919
a letter of reference.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.213
And look, don't worry,

04:53.961 --> 04:56.213
once you pass the written test

04:56.255 --> 04:57.672
the oral's a snap.

05:04.596 --> 05:05.931
Here. Ask them.

05:05.973 --> 05:09.226
Hey, guys...what do you think

05:05.973 --> 05:09.226
of D.J's hair?

05:18.277 --> 05:19.569
Yikes.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.988
Yikes.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.952
Now I'm scaring the dog.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.370
You know, I could've

05:26.994 --> 05:29.370
gone to Alejandro, but no.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.831
I had to go to Mr. Tony

05:30.872 --> 05:34.001
so you could get

05:30.872 --> 05:34.001
your free neck shave.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.753
I'm sorry, Deej. I guess that

05:34.042 --> 05:36.753
lightning strike you took

05:36.795 --> 05:38.297
was more severe than I thought.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.883
Hey, guys.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.761
Yikes.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.972
I don't wanna hear it.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.143
Hi, Kimmy.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.143
Ah! Nice smooth neck.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.269
Thank you.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.522
Michelle, your

05:53.728 --> 05:55.522
Action Rigby's here.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.149
Give me! Give me! Give me!

05:57.191 --> 05:59.901
Hey, I bet mine is here, too.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.658
Hey, nothing's here but a book.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.119
They forgot Rigby!

06:09.161 --> 06:11.079
Uh, Michelle, Michelle..

06:11.121 --> 06:14.082
Uh, I think that's a catalog

06:11.121 --> 06:14.082
to order more Rigby stuff.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.961
Oh, wait, wait,

06:16.168 --> 06:17.961
wait, wait, wait.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.589
See this little

06:19.087 --> 06:21.589
orange packing peanut?

06:23.591 --> 06:26.845
Say hello to Action Rigby!

06:33.101 --> 06:34.853
This can't be it.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.395
It doesn't fly.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.524
It doesn't dance.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.527
Do something!

06:44.487 --> 06:46.240
Oh, Danny, how romantic.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.992
Practicing carrying me

06:46.281 --> 06:48.992
across the threshold.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.328
Well, actually, Vicky.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.328
I-I just waxed the landing

06:51.370 --> 06:52.871
and high heels can be murder.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.708
- Ohh...you.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.088
Hey, lovebirds.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.298
Get a cage.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.592
Hey, sorry.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.094
Did you guys, uh, do this

07:07.135 --> 07:08.678
threshold thing

07:07.135 --> 07:08.678
when you were married?

07:08.720 --> 07:11.056
- Of course.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.056
- Man, you were heavy.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.975
I was carrying the luggage.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.852
- Hey, Mr. Tanner.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.852
- Hey.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.397
Look. Thanks for invitin' me to

07:15.894 --> 07:18.397
the play and all but, um..

07:18.479 --> 07:20.107
Do you know how to get a grease

07:18.479 --> 07:20.107
stain out of a sport jacket?

07:20.148 --> 07:21.858
Well, Steve,

07:20.148 --> 07:21.858
it should be no problem.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.819
It depends if it's had a chance

07:21.900 --> 07:24.819
to set. When did it happen?

07:24.861 --> 07:26.405
Uh, well, let's see.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.405
Today's Saturday, right?

07:26.446 --> 07:29.157
So that'd be, uh

07:26.446 --> 07:29.157
...five years ago.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.662
Steve, can you

07:32.369 --> 07:34.662
believe this hair?

07:35.747 --> 07:36.831
Uh..

07:38.666 --> 07:39.834
Um..

07:42.629 --> 07:43.880
I love it.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.050
Are you kidding? It's awful.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.386
Oh. Oh, man,

07:47.092 --> 07:49.386
oh, yeah. I hate it!

07:50.804 --> 07:52.889
Steve, you just said

07:50.804 --> 07:52.889
you loved it.

07:52.931 --> 07:55.892
No, no, no. But that was before

07:52.931 --> 07:55.892
I knew that you hated it. See?

07:55.934 --> 07:57.852
So what you're saying is

07:55.934 --> 07:57.852
you just lied to me.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.938
No. No, what I'm saying is..

07:59.980 --> 08:01.856
Well, whatever you wanna hear.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.693
I don't wanna hear that.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.404
Oh, then that's not what I said.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.991
Okay, alright.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.991
Let's not panic here.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.533
I'm sure that we can fix this.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.078
Hey, yeah. We can just

08:12.575 --> 08:15.078
wash it out and start all over.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.206
Should've gone to Alejandro.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.251
I know. I know.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.877
Look, Jess,

08:21.293 --> 08:22.877
we may have to get into your

08:22.919 --> 08:24.754
emergency hair care stash.

08:24.796 --> 08:28.716
Alright. Just use that little

08:24.796 --> 08:28.716
red hammer to break the glass.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.802
Come on, D.J., don't worry,

08:28.758 --> 08:30.802
I'm sure it'll look beautiful

08:30.844 --> 08:32.804
no matter what you do to it.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.097
Nice try.

08:36.724 --> 08:39.560
Oh, Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.605
- What'd I do?

08:39.602 --> 08:42.605
- Ha ha ha ha.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.067
He wants to know what he did.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.445
- You waffled.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.445
- Major waffle.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.280
See, the first thing you did

08:48.487 --> 08:50.280
was you said something nice.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.657
- That was good.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.657
- But then you backed off.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.159
That was bad.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.952
For example,

08:54.201 --> 08:55.952
a woman wants to know

08:55.994 --> 08:58.205
if the, if the dress she's

08:55.994 --> 08:58.205
wearing makes her look heavy.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.874
The answer is, "of course not."

09:00.915 --> 09:03.377
Sometimes I like to

09:00.915 --> 09:03.377
mix it up with, uh..

09:03.418 --> 09:06.129
"No, no, you're not fat. I think

09:03.418 --> 09:06.129
it's just thick material."

09:08.173 --> 09:10.342
Okay, now it's your turn, okay.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.886
D.J. asks you did you think

09:10.384 --> 09:12.886
that girl walking by

09:12.927 --> 09:14.513
in the string bikini

09:12.927 --> 09:14.513
is attractive?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.181
The answer is?

09:16.223 --> 09:17.682
No.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.267
Incorrect.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.935
The correct answer is,

09:19.309 --> 09:20.935
"what girl?

09:20.977 --> 09:22.687
I didn't see a girl. I don't

09:20.977 --> 09:22.687
know what you're talking about "

09:22.729 --> 09:24.147
See, that's the correct answer.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.150
See, Stephen,

09:24.189 --> 09:27.150
women are, uh..

09:27.192 --> 09:28.568
What's the word

09:27.192 --> 09:28.568
I'm lookin' for?

09:28.609 --> 09:31.196
Overly sensitive

09:28.609 --> 09:31.196
about their appearance.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.282
So, it is our job as men

09:31.238 --> 09:34.282
to make the woman in our life

09:34.324 --> 09:36.368
feel good about herself.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.911
So, uh, basically

09:36.410 --> 09:37.911
what you're saying is

09:37.952 --> 09:39.579
that no matter how D.J. looks

09:39.620 --> 09:42.623
it's always my job to tell her

09:39.620 --> 09:42.623
she looks like a hot babe.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.168
Exactly, but, uh..

09:45.210 --> 09:47.379
...since we're talkin'

09:45.210 --> 09:47.379
about my daughter here

09:47.421 --> 09:49.923
uh, would you mind replacing

09:47.421 --> 09:49.923
the words "hot babe"

09:49.964 --> 09:52.592
with, uh, "excellent student?"

09:52.633 --> 09:53.927
Thank you.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.763
Joey.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.806
Oh, can you guys give me

09:56.804 --> 09:58.806
a little push here?

10:02.685 --> 10:03.770
One.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.398
Oh, man. It's break time.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.609
Joey, Stephanie said

10:06.440 --> 10:09.609
I got ripped off.

10:09.650 --> 10:13.947
She did. Look at the giant

10:09.650 --> 10:13.947
Action Rigby they sent her.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.824
On the commercial,

10:13.988 --> 10:16.824
it was humongous.

10:16.866 --> 10:21.580
Well, uh...they do say

10:16.866 --> 10:21.580
TV adds about ten pounds.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.791
So I did get ripped off.

10:24.832 --> 10:29.003
Oh, Michelle. Hey,

10:24.832 --> 10:29.003
that just happens sometimes.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.965
Um, tell you what. Let me, uh..

10:32.006 --> 10:34.008
Let me show you somethin', okay.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.886
When I was um,

10:34.050 --> 10:36.886
when I was a kid

10:36.928 --> 10:39.806
I wanted to be a,

10:36.928 --> 10:39.806
a Ventriloquist, right?

10:39.847 --> 10:42.350
So, I-I sent away for this.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.396
Mr. Talkie.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.316
Look, his mouth is painted on.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.403
So, how are you, Mr. Talkie?

10:53.445 --> 10:55.780
[mumbling]

10:56.573 --> 10:58.158
Thank you, Mr. Talkie.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.494
[muffled scream]

11:00.535 --> 11:04.331
So the point is, Michelle...

11:00.535 --> 11:04.331
everyone gets taken sometimes.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.791
You mean you can't do anything?

11:06.833 --> 11:09.877
Well, I think I saw

11:06.833 --> 11:09.877
an 800 number in the catalog.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.798
We don't have time

11:09.919 --> 11:13.798
to dial 800 numbers!

11:13.840 --> 11:17.511
No. Michelle, you see,

11:13.840 --> 11:17.511
uh...we'll talk later.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.430
Come on. Let's go

11:17.552 --> 11:20.430
make a phone call. Let's go.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.849
It's ringing.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.849
I'll put it on speaker phone.

11:25.726 --> 11:29.063

'It's the fun you bring to it.'

11:55.549 --> 11:57.884
'Have a happy Rigby day.'

11:57.925 --> 12:00.887
"Have a happy Rigby day?"

11:57.925 --> 12:00.887
The nerve of those guys.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.930
At least they could

12:00.928 --> 12:02.930
pretend to care.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.058
I spent all

12:02.972 --> 12:05.058
my tooth fairy money

12:05.099 --> 12:06.643
and all I got was

12:05.099 --> 12:06.643
a hole in my mouth

12:06.685 --> 12:08.186
and a piece of junk.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.730
[knock on door]

12:11.772 --> 12:13.274
I got it.

- Hey, Denise.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.736
- I got ripped off!

Me, too!

Guys, you gotta give it up

'cause there's nothing

12:22.242 --> 12:23.784
you can do.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.495
Ha! There's plenty we can do.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.247
Rigby's at the mall today,

12:25.537 --> 12:27.247
right?

12:27.288 --> 12:29.374
Right. But I don't

12:27.288 --> 12:29.374
wanna see him.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.875
Oh, we're gonna

12:29.416 --> 12:30.875
see him, alright.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.335
In fact, we're gonna

12:30.917 --> 12:32.335
get all your friends

12:32.377 --> 12:34.962
and we're gonna rattle

12:32.377 --> 12:34.962
that rhino's horn.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.966
Wow. Joey, you're steamed.

Ooh! I hate that rhino!

Alright. Here's what

12:43.221 --> 12:45.390
we're gonna do, okay.

we're afraid of you.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.648
you know, I can't believe

Steve lied to me

15:40.690 --> 15:43.276
about my hair.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.611
Should we tell her?

15:44.652 --> 15:46.487
I think she's ready.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.656
It's time you learned

15:46.529 --> 15:48.656
the facts about men.

15:48.698 --> 15:52.159
Oh, it's okay. They gave us

15:48.698 --> 15:52.159
the pamphlet in fifth grade.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.829
We know the pamphlet.

15:54.871 --> 15:57.665
Yes. This goes

15:54.871 --> 15:57.665
way beyond the pamphlet.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.000
See, when you ask a man

15:57.707 --> 16:00.000
"How do I look?"

16:00.042 --> 16:02.670
Men become,

16:00.042 --> 16:02.670
how do I put this nicely?

Spineless jellyfish.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.800
Yes, yes, yes,

16:04.923 --> 16:06.800
you made what is considered

16:06.841 --> 16:09.051
the classic rookie mistake.

16:09.093 --> 16:13.347
You asked a man what he thought

16:09.093 --> 16:13.347
and expected the truth.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.767
I know you guys a lot

16:13.389 --> 16:15.767
are older than me, but..

16:18.060 --> 16:21.856
Did I say older?

16:18.060 --> 16:21.856
I meant wiser.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.567
But I can't believe

16:21.898 --> 16:24.567
what you're saying about men.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.778
It's true,

16:24.609 --> 16:26.778
when it comes to how we look

16:26.820 --> 16:29.781
guys will always

16:26.820 --> 16:29.781
avoid confrontation.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.533
They would rather

16:29.823 --> 16:32.533
hand over the remote.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.830
You're exaggerating.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.289
No, I'm not.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.876
Should we put it to the test?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.461
She's gotta learn sometime.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.008
Alright, Steve. Next scenario.

D.J's just come home

16:49.049 --> 16:51.427
from the beauty parlor

16:51.469 --> 16:54.555
and it looks like her hair

16:51.469 --> 16:54.555
was greased with crankcase oil.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.021
Not dry like other girls.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.481
Now that is excellent, Stephen.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.859
Complimentary without

17:03.523 --> 17:05.859
a hint of waffle.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.613
Okay, Deej, watch and learn.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.951
(Becky)

17:12.198 --> 17:14.951
'Well, don't you guys

17:12.198 --> 17:14.951
look nice.'

17:17.871 --> 17:20.373
Alright, Steve-o,

17:17.871 --> 17:20.373
watch and learn.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.002
Becky, you are a vision of..

17:25.461 --> 17:27.547
What's with the shoes?

17:25.461 --> 17:27.547
You forgot to change your shoes.

17:29.256 --> 17:31.801
What, you don't like them?

17:29.256 --> 17:31.801
I thought they looked cute.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.016
Ah. Hey, babe.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.600
Cute as a bug.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.728
I can't tell you how many times

17:39.642 --> 17:41.728
I saw Michael Jordan

17:41.769 --> 17:43.813
and thought, ooh, cute shoes.

17:45.272 --> 17:48.275
- Thanks, honey. That's sweet.

17:45.272 --> 17:48.275
- Ahh.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.778
See? See that?

17:48.317 --> 17:50.778
That was a nice recovery.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.822
You are learning

17:50.820 --> 17:52.822
from a master over there.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.200
I'm ready.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.120
Vicky...sweetheart.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.499
Were you shopping

18:00.162 --> 18:03.499
at sea world again, honey?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.377
Oh, you mean the earrings?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.377
Aren't these great?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.505
Oh. Yeah.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.505
Oh, they're fabulous.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.131
Honey, you know,

18:09.547 --> 18:11.131
the great thing about them is

18:11.173 --> 18:13.175
when I nibble on your ear

18:11.173 --> 18:13.175
I can listen to the ocean.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.886
- Ooh.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.886
- See.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.763
See, Steve-o,

18:14.928 --> 18:16.763
that was beautiful.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.222
Why aren't you takin' notes?

18:18.264 --> 18:19.640
(D.J.)

18:18.264 --> 18:19.640
'I'm ready.'

18:21.059 --> 18:23.603
Alright. Go get 'em, killer.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.525
Wow, Deej, you look..

18:33.029 --> 18:35.782
You look, you look..

18:35.823 --> 18:39.118
You look, um...l-l-like

18:35.823 --> 18:39.118
nothing I've ever seen.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.956
Well, I-I'm

18:40.661 --> 18:42.956
going for an evening look.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.457
What do you think?

18:44.498 --> 18:47.543
Well, uh, on the positive side..

18:48.544 --> 18:49.921
...you're an excellent student.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.510
I'm talking about my makeup.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.805
Do you like it?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.014
Um..

19:03.183 --> 19:05.269
Oh, guys, I can't do it.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.854
D.J., y-you're so

19:05.311 --> 19:06.854
naturally beautiful.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.606
Why you wearing all that goop?

19:08.648 --> 19:11.651
You know, your face, looks like,

19:08.648 --> 19:11.651
looks like a parrot exploded.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.780
I love you, Steve.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.827
Eh, guys? See? Not every woman

19:18.074 --> 19:20.827
is overly sensitive.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.127
Overly sensitive?

19:29.168 --> 19:34.256
Oh, w-w-well, o-overly, deriving

19:29.168 --> 19:34.256
from the Greek word<i> Overopolis.</i>

19:34.298 --> 19:39.261
Uh, meaning just enough or the

19:34.298 --> 19:39.261
perfect amount of sensitivity.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.472
See, Steve. I knew

19:39.303 --> 19:41.472
you would be honest with me.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.557
Aunt Becky and Vicky were

19:41.514 --> 19:43.557
trying to prove that

19:43.599 --> 19:46.477
men would say anything

19:43.599 --> 19:46.477
to avoid confrontation.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.105
Well, we won't say anything

19:46.519 --> 19:49.105
to avoid confrontation.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.482
If there's something

19:49.147 --> 19:51.482
on our minds, we say it.

19:51.524 --> 19:55.111
- Hey, right on, brother man.

19:51.524 --> 19:55.111
- Brother man!

19:55.153 --> 19:56.696
And besides,

19:55.153 --> 19:56.696
I knew you were foolin'

19:56.737 --> 19:58.280
with those shoes the whole time.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.449
Yeah, and I knew

19:58.322 --> 20:00.449
those earrings were a joke.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.493
I love these earrings.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.537
So do I!

20:04.578 --> 20:06.080
I'm joking.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.790
So was I!

20:07.832 --> 20:10.626
- Brother man.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.628
Well, I think

20:10.668 --> 20:12.628
that proves our point.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.088
You know what? We should

20:12.670 --> 20:14.088
get ready before we're late.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.215
And you know, you guys

20:16.256 --> 20:19.010
you could really learn something

20:16.256 --> 20:19.010
from Steve here.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.016
"Ahhh, I can't do it, guys.."

20:25.058 --> 20:27.226
"You're so naturally

20:25.058 --> 20:27.226
beautiful, Deej.."

20:27.267 --> 20:29.729
Guys, come on, I thought you

20:27.267 --> 20:29.729
avoided confrontation.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.981
Yeah. In the house. Get outside.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.441
Hey, come on, you guys. There's

20:32.023 --> 20:34.441
nothin' to feel down about.

20:34.483 --> 20:38.445
Sometimes just makin' a stand

20:34.483 --> 20:38.445
is a victory in itself.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.447
It took a lot of courage

20:38.487 --> 20:40.447
to get up on that stage

20:40.489 --> 20:42.533
and tell that rhino

20:40.489 --> 20:42.533
how you felt.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.995
But I'm just a little kid.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.995
He didn't even listen to me.

20:46.037 --> 20:50.750
Yeah. He sure got his tail

20:46.037 --> 20:50.750
out of there pretty fast.

20:50.791 --> 20:54.170
Yeah. But all those kids

20:50.791 --> 20:54.170
heard you guys today.

20:54.212 --> 20:56.296
And you might've saved them

20:54.212 --> 20:56.296
from wasting their allowance

20:56.338 --> 20:59.133
or their tooth fairy money

20:56.338 --> 20:59.133
on an Action Rigby.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.343
You guys made

20:59.175 --> 21:01.343
a big difference today.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.555
Well, I don't feel different.
