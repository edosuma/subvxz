NARRATOR:
Previously on Prison Break .'

00:02.795 --> 00:04.714
It will work out. You have my word.

00:04.881 --> 00:06.257
Be careful.

00:06.424 --> 00:08.217
Jane's gonna look after you. Hey.

00:10.011 --> 00:12.180
I have a sister I haven't talked to
in 15 years.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.640
- You think she's better off for it?
- Bruce?

00:14.807 --> 00:17.810
We said not to use this number,
but I needed to know you were okay.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.228
It was you.

00:19.395 --> 00:21.230
<i>BRUCE:
What are you talking about, Sara?</i>

00:24.859 --> 00:27.904
I got three words for you.
We gotta run.

00:28.905 --> 00:31.991
I wanna turn myself in.
But I got one condition.

00:32.158 --> 00:34.076
Your wife was released an hour ago.

00:34.243 --> 00:37.580
She'll be here soon.
Just hold up your end of the deal.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.081
I'll get you Scofield.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.834
ALDO: An NSA analyst
sympathetic to our cause...

00:42.001 --> 00:45.129
...got his hands on a phone
conversation the president had...

00:45.296 --> 00:48.591
...with Terrence Steadman two weeks
after you supposedly killed him.

00:48.758 --> 00:52.428
Twenty-four hours later, Tancredi
is dead, the analyst is missing...

00:52.595 --> 00:56.224
...and the White House echelon tapes
have been deleted from the mainframe.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.559
There's a tape.
It gives us everything we need.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.686
Linc will be set free if we find it.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.271
You have something here.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.774
There'll be a lot
who wish you didn't, but you do.

01:04.941 --> 01:07.401
You think it's a conversation?

01:07.944 --> 01:09.445
One they don't want us to hear.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.533
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.982
Oh, my God.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.235
Yeah.

01:51.821 --> 01:55.324
Patoshik, dead.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.951
Franklin, incarcerated...

01:57.118 --> 01:59.745
...and assisting with
the capture of Scofield and Burrows.

01:59.912 --> 02:03.165
- What exactly is the protocol with that?
- I'll handle that.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.875
We're at the halfway mark, people.

02:05.084 --> 02:08.963
Burrows, Scofield, Bagwell, Sucre.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.381
They're still out there.

02:10.548 --> 02:13.175
- Now, I heard a report came in from...
- Mexico.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.512
Fernando Sucre was almost
apprehended at the airport in lxtapa.

02:25.521 --> 02:26.772
Excuse me.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.818
My office, please.

02:33.863 --> 02:36.782
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I came for my damn money.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.202
- Your what?
- The Patoshik reward money.

02:40.369 --> 02:44.373
See, how a reward works is,
someone gets rewarded the money.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.709
And since I'm the one
who bloodhounded Haywire...

02:46.876 --> 02:48.336
...the money is rewarded to me.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.712
You come to my office--?

02:49.879 --> 02:52.715
If you'd returned any of my calls,
I wouldn't have had to.

02:52.882 --> 02:55.384
- We had a deal.
- The deal was you stay under the radar.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.386
Is this under the radar, Brad?

02:57.553 --> 03:01.223
No, this is an office full of federal agents
who now have all seen your face.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.476
Hey, I don't care what they see.

03:03.642 --> 03:09.273
Hell, if you don't pay up,
I'll go out there and drop trou.

03:23.079 --> 03:26.248
Patoshik died, you stupid son of a bitch.

03:26.415 --> 03:29.752
There's paperwork involved.
Of course you're gonna get the money.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.379
But you'll have to be patient.

03:32.296 --> 03:36.592
And if you ever
come in my office again...

03:37.927 --> 03:40.304
...you will not only never see the cash...

03:40.471 --> 03:42.598
...you'll never see another sunrise.

03:51.107 --> 03:54.443
We gonna keep crying about money
you've already got coming to you...

03:55.486 --> 03:57.613
...or do you wanna make some more?

03:58.197 --> 04:00.116
I'm listening.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.537
Ever been to Mexico?

04:07.790 --> 04:10.501
LINCOLN: We give this to the press,
the government will discredit it.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.628
Just like they did
with the tape we made.

04:12.795 --> 04:14.046
Okay-

04:14.755 --> 04:17.298
So, what do we do with it?

04:17.466 --> 04:20.302
There are people in the administration
Dad was working with.

04:20.553 --> 04:23.931
If we give it to them, they'll finally have
the smoking gun they need...

04:24.098 --> 04:25.808
...to bring Caroline Reynolds down.

04:26.142 --> 04:28.936
But they'll release the tape, not us.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.772
And how can she discredit
her own appointees? Sure.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.525
We're gonna give the only thing
that can exonerate me...

04:34.692 --> 04:36.652
...to someone who works
for the government?

04:36.819 --> 04:39.989
The same government that set me up?!

04:40.364 --> 04:43.826
We'll have to find someone
we can trust. Someone honest.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.661
Jane Phillips.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.580
She'll know someone that can help us.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.498
She worked with Dad.
She's watching I.J.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.167
I trust her, Michael.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.502
She'll do it. She'll find someone.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.590
Well, I hope you're right.

05:00.176 --> 05:02.553
Because this is our last shot.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.598
This'll do you right.

05:05.890 --> 05:08.017
It's good from a thousand yards out.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.977
She a clean shot?

05:10.144 --> 05:12.646

she does not stray.

- She's a throw-in.

The serial numbers have been cleaned.

05:31.207 --> 05:33.626
The chamber's been scraped

05:33.792 --> 05:37.379

you know, shooting at tin cans.

I just don't know how often
he checks this thing, all right?

06:29.098 --> 06:32.851
It seems not that often, considering
you've posted three messages.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.020
I'm starting to wonder
why I need you at all.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.940
To get Scofield. What?
What are we doing here?

06:38.816 --> 06:42.069
Well, I can type, and Scofield can't see
who's sending him the messages.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.948
Well, he's gonna see whatever little
rent-a-fed cops you guys have set up...

06:46.115 --> 06:48.033
...whatever place you set up
to meet him.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.369

how smart this kid is, right?

06:50.536 --> 06:52.746
Smarter than you,
considering you're wearing orange.

- Yeah.

- Don't pretend you don't need me!
- You overheard--

07:10.764 --> 07:13.559
- He's a Boy Scout.
- I don't see how that helps!

07:13.726 --> 07:16.061
If you have a bit of patience,
he will hit me back!

I get Dede medical care.

07:30.075 --> 07:33.120
- Do we?
- So I'll hold up my end of the bargain.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.498
And guess what? You hold up yours.
