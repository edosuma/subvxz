<i>One day, in a town at
the edge of the world...</i>

00:30.217 --> 00:32.383
<i>...the tide went out
and never returned.</i>

00:36.967 --> 00:39.217
<i>The sea just left without warning.</i>

00:45.217 --> 00:47.133
<i>At first people were
little more than puzzled.</i>

00:47.217 --> 00:49.133
<i>They continued to gossip and...</i>

00:49.217 --> 00:51.717
<i>...fight over the same
old things.</i>

00:54.383 --> 00:57.883
<i>soon a silence began to
permeate the township.</i>

01:06.467 --> 01:08.883
<i>A desert of unbelievable
magnitude...</i>

01:08.925 --> 01:11.008
<i>...was forming before
their very eyes.</i>

02:13.675 --> 02:16.529
We come together as
family and friends...

02:16.564 --> 02:19.383
...to farewell him
and to grieve for him.

02:19.925 --> 02:22.550
We think especially
of you, his family;...

02:22.967 --> 02:26.175
...Andrew, Penny, Jonathan.

02:26.467 --> 02:30.633
For the loss of a father, a
father-in-law and grandfather.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.717
Part of our grief may be regret...

02:35.800 --> 02:38.675
...for things done or left undone,...

02:39.467 --> 02:42.967
...words said or words never said.

02:53.633 --> 02:54.717
Yes?

02:56.550 --> 02:57.717
Is Andrew there?

02:59.217 --> 03:00.550
You must be Paul...

03:02.050 --> 03:03.883
Please, come in...

03:08.717 --> 03:09.800
I'm Penny.

03:10.050 --> 03:12.133
- Hi Penny.
- Andrew's wife...

03:15.633 --> 03:17.217
Ah, they're in here.

03:21.967 --> 03:22.883
Andrew?

03:26.217 --> 03:27.550
His brother.

03:29.300 --> 03:30.800
Sorry, my….

03:31.717 --> 03:33.133
...plane was delayed in Hong Kong.

03:37.050 --> 03:37.967
Paul?

03:41.717 --> 03:45.133
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

03:52.050 --> 03:53.050
Jonathan!

03:59.967 --> 04:00.800
So...

04:00.883 --> 04:03.050
...how's London? Is
that where you're based?

04:03.467 --> 04:06.300
Actually I'm spending more
time in Istanbul these days...

04:11.300 --> 04:12.133
Oh Jesus, fuck it...

04:12.217 --> 04:14.717
My balance is complete, fuck.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.216
It's fine, really.

04:22.883 --> 04:25.633
You...have a nice place.
You've really done well.

04:28.383 --> 04:30.383
I'll get Penny to make
up a bed in a spare room.

04:30.550 --> 04:32.467
No that's fine. I made
reservations from London.

04:32.633 --> 04:35.467
- No really...it's no trouble.
- It's done. Andrew it's done. Thank you.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
So...

04:43.467 --> 04:46.967
- ...he's gone
- Yeah.

05:36.967 --> 05:37.800
Paul wait...

05:40.050 --> 05:40.883
Paul wait...

05:42.383 --> 05:44.050
Paul come back home...

05:45.133 --> 05:46.717
Paul don't leave...

05:48.842 --> 05:49.717
Paul…

06:22.633 --> 06:23.467
Andrew?

06:25.467 --> 06:27.050
Shit the lawyers.

06:27.883 --> 06:29.050
Oh fuck!

06:29.550 --> 06:30.550
Sorry.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.633
Sorry, I wanted to be there.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.717
Slept in. How did it go?

06:38.883 --> 06:40.217
He left you a third.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.383
Well, you deserve two thirds.

06:46.967 --> 06:48.550
He left me a third as well.

06:53.967 --> 06:54.967
And the rest?

07:00.217 --> 07:02.133
He left it to a charity.

07:07.217 --> 07:09.550
He... Listen I need to move on this.

07:10.133 --> 07:13.550
We need to clear the orchard and the
cottage. I can't wait around Paul.

07:13.585 --> 07:15.682
I made an appointment for you
to see the lawyer on Tuesday.

07:15.717 --> 07:18.050
- Well, I'll drop by and see him later.
- You can't just drop by and see.

07:21.383 --> 07:24.467
- You can't just drop by and see them Paul.
- Right.

07:26.550 --> 07:30.217
Hey, you know what? Another
job came through, so…

07:31.717 --> 07:32.717
I'm leaving...

07:32.967 --> 07:33.883
Tomorrow.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.800
Well you obviously have
more important things.

07:42.467 --> 07:45.383
- I'll see you in another 17 years.
- Come on Andrew, don't be such an old?

07:45.467 --> 07:46.550
Come on Andrew don't what?

07:47.217 --> 07:48.883
How long have you been
here Paul? Two days?

07:49.300 --> 07:51.383
Forget the fact this all just leaves me.

07:52.217 --> 07:53.348
You're just like when Mom died.

07:53.383 --> 07:56.550
Leave Mom the fuck out of it. At
least have the decency to do that.

07:56.717 --> 07:57.217
- Decency?
- Yeah!

07:57.800 --> 07:59.515
You think you're the one being decent?

07:59.550 --> 08:02.967
Swanning in here like some
bloody film star with your accent?

08:03.002 --> 08:05.467
You know nothing about me, Andrew.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.467
Listen...

08:12.550 --> 08:14.633
...he would have wanted
you to have these.

08:20.717 --> 08:21.967
I almost forgot.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.348
They handed me this
at the council meeting.

08:24.383 --> 08:26.425
You dropped it at the pub
the afternoon of the service.

08:26.467 --> 08:28.467
It could be useful going home.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.467
You didn't have to lie to me, Paul.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.799
We weren't expecting
you in the first place.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.467
That's good wine you're spilling.

13:24.967 --> 13:26.217
How did you find this place?

13:26.467 --> 13:27.717
I heard music.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.133
Mom doesn't know about this place?

13:33.633 --> 13:34.633
No she doesn't.

13:43.050 --> 13:44.050
It's okay.

13:44.967 --> 13:46.050
You can stay.

14:33.633 --> 14:35.133
When do you think you'll learn?

14:35.383 --> 14:38.883
As soon as we get these blood samples
back and the swabs... A couple of days.

14:40.633 --> 14:42.216
I've extended my trip.

14:42.251 --> 14:43.800
Let's sort the house out.

14:53.217 --> 14:54.300
Paul!

14:56.050 --> 14:57.217
Thanks.

15:13.133 --> 15:14.467
Green Tea.

15:16.550 --> 15:17.800
What's he doing down there?

15:17.967 --> 15:21.300
There's been an outbreak of some
virus. I'm praying they're okay.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.098
He cares about you, Paul.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.300
He never told Jonathan about me.

15:31.967 --> 15:34.133
We each have our own way
of dealing with things.

15:38.883 --> 15:40.883
I can't believe how
much you look like Mom.

16:18.550 --> 16:19.633
Who is she?

16:22.550 --> 16:24.050
That's Hope.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.633
Is she crying?

16:34.050 --> 16:35.300
She's thinking.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.633
What about?

16:43.467 --> 16:45.050
Many things.

17:26.717 --> 17:27.883
Jesus!

17:28.883 --> 17:30.050
What are you doing here?

17:32.383 --> 17:34.050
It was just a place that I found...

17:34.967 --> 17:37.383
...that no one else
comes to. And I just...

17:38.883 --> 17:40.675
- Did he let you come here?
- No.

17:40.710 --> 17:42.467
No one else knows that I come here.

17:45.717 --> 17:48.050
You know… I should probably go.

17:48.217 --> 17:49.508
Yeah, you should.

17:50.383 --> 17:52.883
I'll give you a couple of minutes to
get your shit together and get out.

19:31.467 --> 19:34.717
Paulie? Paulie Prior?

19:35.717 --> 19:36.675
Hey, Winnie.

19:39.883 --> 19:42.300
- Look who it is.
- How are you doing?

19:44.758 --> 19:47.300
I was looking for you at the service.

19:47.633 --> 19:50.633
I thought I bet the little bugger is here
somewhere and I don't even recognize him.

19:50.668 --> 19:53.633
No, I had some complications.
- Oh, that's a shame.

19:54.133 --> 19:55.175
Hey, you remember Pat...

19:55.300 --> 19:58.967
Pat, look, look who
it is... it's Paulie.

20:00.050 --> 20:01.050
Ms. Seager?

20:01.967 --> 20:03.300
Well, well...

20:05.383 --> 20:08.467
- Kia ora Paul.
- I had no idea you were still here.

20:08.842 --> 20:10.967
What? You thought I'd dropped
off the face off the earth?

20:11.050 --> 20:13.717
And he even has the fancy
blooming plumy accent.

20:25.717 --> 20:26.800
War zones.

20:27.842 --> 20:31.758
From the genocide in Rwanda to the
ceaseless fighting in the Middle East...

20:32.800 --> 20:34.883
...and the horrors of
the Bosnian conflict.

20:35.967 --> 20:38.925
War zones have been both home
and work for the last decade...

20:39.050 --> 20:40.800
...to the man you are about to meet.

20:40.967 --> 20:43.050
A man whose dedication and
courage has gained him...

20:43.092 --> 20:46.217
...an international reputation
of the highest merit...

20:46.800 --> 20:49.300
...not to mention the numerous
awards he has received for...

20:49.342 --> 20:51.175
...both his articles and photographs.

20:52.550 --> 20:57.550
And that he is an old dear student of
mine who I taught in these very buildings.

20:58.883 --> 21:00.925
I present to you Paul Prior.

21:12.467 --> 21:13.383
Thank you.

21:13.967 --> 21:16.675
That was a very generous
introduction Ms. Seagar.

21:18.050 --> 21:20.092
My school reports were never that good.

21:23.842 --> 21:25.008
The truth is that...

21:25.050 --> 21:28.515
...I've been called many things...

21:28.550 --> 21:31.258
...many worse things since I last
stepped foot in this building.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.758
Vulture, parasite, leech.

21:38.467 --> 21:39.883
And...

21:41.633 --> 21:44.967
...it's amazing how insults in most
languages sound pretty much the same.

21:46.383 --> 21:47.925
I was once...

21:49.717 --> 21:51.717
...held captive for three days...

21:51.752 --> 21:53.883
...and publicly urinated on.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.432
I don't really know what to say.

21:58.467 --> 22:01.342
But I'd be happy to answer any
questions that you might have.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.383
He was a finalist for the Pulitzer.

22:50.133 --> 22:52.217
Pulitzer? What the hell is that?

22:52.883 --> 22:54.133
It's a huge prize.

22:55.133 --> 22:57.300
He had a one in three
chance of winning it as well.

22:59.467 --> 23:01.967
He first work for printing
and for taking photos.

23:02.383 --> 23:04.717
But he does both.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.883
- How do you know this shit?
- I read an interview.

23:07.883 --> 23:09.383
Sounds like a lonely wolf.

23:11.633 --> 23:14.550
That reminds me I'm thinking
of getting a tattoo...

23:15.050 --> 23:16.800
A little unicorn... Right here.

23:18.217 --> 23:21.383
Why? Steve has exactly the same one?

23:21.633 --> 23:23.217
No, I just think it would be cool.

23:28.217 --> 23:29.300
So anyway...

23:31.883 --> 23:33.550
...how'd it go with Jake?

23:34.217 --> 23:36.717
- Piss off.
- Tell me!

23:42.217 --> 23:44.633
First of all we had a moonlight
stroll down the beach...

23:45.133 --> 23:47.133
...and a candlelight dinner...

23:47.383 --> 23:49.550
...and then he told me
what beautiful eyes I had.

23:50.550 --> 23:51.467
Really?

23:51.550 --> 23:52.967
Hayýr, çük kafalý.

23:53.717 --> 23:56.717
No you dickhead... He only got
drinks to go to Big Day Out.

23:56.752 --> 23:59.717
He talks like is from
Brixton. You know he was like:

23:59.800 --> 24:02.467
Yo man. Yo bitch.

24:04.467 --> 24:06.967
But I don't think it
should be quite so obvious?

24:10.550 --> 24:12.883
I was reading the local rag today...

24:14.217 --> 24:16.717
...the medic team...
calling the cell phone.

24:17.217 --> 24:18.383
Front page.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.133
Oh God! I'd forgotten how quiet it is.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.550
I've had this bloody ringing in
my ears ever since I got here.

24:32.217 --> 24:34.050
Maybe the change here will do you good.

24:35.050 --> 24:38.383
Like I said, if you ever get
bored photographing war...

24:43.050 --> 24:44.883
You weren't being serious were you?

24:46.300 --> 24:48.217
I'm three staff down, Paul.

24:50.050 --> 24:51.717
I know it might sound desperate but...

24:51.800 --> 24:54.467
Pat, I'd be hopeless, I've
never taught in my life. Come on.

24:54.967 --> 24:58.050
You got out and made something
of yourself. What can beat that?

24:59.717 --> 25:03.133
Half these kids don't even know what's
on the other side of those hills.

25:27.633 --> 25:28.883
Paul?

25:29.550 --> 25:34.717
- Great! Take one of your Mom…
- No! Don't!

25:45.550 --> 25:46.633
Paul gave it to Jonathan…

25:47.883 --> 25:49.883
It's got a good Zeiss lens.

25:53.883 --> 25:55.467
It's much, much too kind.

25:55.550 --> 25:58.550
No…it's fine. Honestly, I'm
using digital these days.

25:58.633 --> 26:00.967
If you're going to be a serious
photographer, you need a good zoom lens.

26:08.050 --> 26:11.550
See you tomorrow then.

26:17.717 --> 26:19.217
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight Paul.

26:28.883 --> 26:31.050
Jonathan said he gave
a talk at the school.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.883
Apparently the kids really liked him.

26:37.883 --> 26:38.717
Good.

27:53.383 --> 27:56.217
- Can I fuck you now?
- God! You've got a way with words!

27:59.633 --> 28:01.550
Sorry, what do you want to do then?

28:06.800 --> 28:08.383
What you all doing man?

28:08.467 --> 28:09.883
Just playing.

28:15.883 --> 28:17.133
Just play carefully...

28:19.800 --> 28:22.717
Shit! Ah! Fuck you, crazy bitch!

28:24.550 --> 28:26.800
You're meant to stay still!

28:58.967 --> 29:00.383
You look well.

29:01.383 --> 29:03.217
Well used more like it.

29:04.967 --> 29:08.217
It's different. Your
accent. ...so English.

29:08.300 --> 29:09.383
You think?

29:10.550 --> 29:12.050
Well, it was inevitable.

29:12.300 --> 29:13.717
...sick of being called an Australian.

29:14.050 --> 29:14.967
Fair enough.

29:16.383 --> 29:18.467
- Help yourself.
- Oh no, I quit.

29:22.467 --> 29:24.717
- Kids?
- Yeah two!

29:25.217 --> 29:26.133
One of each.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.967
- Remember Ben?
- Ben Steimer?

29:31.383 --> 29:32.633
Yeah.

29:33.717 --> 29:36.717
We got together about
18 months after you left.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.383
He died when my first child was five.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.967
- Motorbike.
- I'm sorry.

29:45.717 --> 29:48.265
I was pregnant with
Sam at the time so...

29:48.300 --> 29:52.217
...I had the kids to think about and
decided to keep the business running.

29:52.383 --> 29:53.467
What was that?

29:54.133 --> 29:55.133
Butchery.

29:55.550 --> 29:57.217
Shortest butcher in New Zealand!

30:02.300 --> 30:03.182
Really?

30:03.217 --> 30:04.800
Yeah well I'm a ninja
with a boning knife.

30:04.835 --> 30:06.300
No surprises there.

30:10.550 --> 30:13.800
I see your brother from time to time.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.050
Yeah, he's….he's up to
his neck in ostriches.

30:20.550 --> 30:22.800
Is he still married?
I never see his wife.

30:22.883 --> 30:26.383
No, yeah, no. I don't
think she goes out much.

30:42.967 --> 30:45.717
How many times have I told you about
leaving the gate to the pen open?

31:06.383 --> 31:09.717
If you think you're going to
see this again you're mistaken.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.633
You disgust me.

31:20.217 --> 31:21.550
Who the hell is this guy?

31:21.633 --> 31:25.050
- Look, just an old school friend. It's no big deal.
- No big deal?

31:25.133 --> 31:25.967
Where's my jacket?

31:28.217 --> 31:29.467
Celia, it's rubbish night.

31:29.550 --> 31:32.467
And please tie the bags. I don't
want dogs getting into them. Bye.

31:36.133 --> 31:38.383
Hey, we'll be waiting.

31:41.883 --> 31:43.300
Need a hand with that?

31:44.383 --> 31:45.550
Done your homework?

31:48.800 --> 31:50.217
Please take your foot away?

31:51.383 --> 31:53.050
What? Do you think I've
never done homework?

31:55.550 --> 31:56.550
Just asking.

32:03.467 --> 32:04.800
I'm sure we used to be able to do this.

32:26.300 --> 32:27.967
Did you think of me?

32:30.967 --> 32:32.633
I was terrified of seeing you.

32:49.133 --> 32:52.633
You remember those poems and
stories you used to write?

32:52.717 --> 32:55.717
I was going to put music
to them, release an album...

32:56.133 --> 32:57.550
What were we going to call ourselves?

33:00.717 --> 33:04.383
What was it? Was it silly bastards?

33:07.967 --> 33:09.217
Silly…stupid buggers?

33:10.800 --> 33:11.800
Sick mother fuckers?

33:11.883 --> 33:12.883
Sick fuckers, wasn't it?

33:14.717 --> 33:17.342
Sick Puppy, actually.

33:20.550 --> 33:21.800
Live at the Hammersmith.

33:23.883 --> 33:27.800
See that's me. Eight years
behind what was going on.

33:29.883 --> 33:32.800
But, you know, still thinking
I had created it all for myself.

35:27.550 --> 35:30.800
Hi. I've got an assignment
where I have to...

35:30.883 --> 35:33.508
...interview an important
local community member.

35:34.050 --> 35:39.383
And it was a choice between you and Mr.
Aiken who set up the irrigation main.

35:39.467 --> 35:41.300
I was just wondering if
I could interview you.

35:45.633 --> 35:46.717
Can I come in?

36:09.217 --> 36:10.508
Is there real coffee?

36:14.383 --> 36:15.883
Sure. How do you love it?

36:17.258 --> 36:18.800
Macchiato thanks.

36:29.217 --> 36:30.800
I'm Celia by the way.

36:48.633 --> 36:52.467
- I gather you do have some questions?
- Yes. Ah Yeah.

36:54.550 --> 36:57.300
Okay. So, how did you
get to do what you do?

36:58.633 --> 37:00.883
Well, I was working for a paper
in London on local articles...

37:00.967 --> 37:02.967
...and they needed
somebody to go to Bosnia.

37:03.092 --> 37:06.050
That's right, yeah. You were working
as a typesetter in Wellington...

37:06.883 --> 37:08.842
...and you studied
journalism in London...

37:08.967 --> 37:13.508
...and found your break as a feature article
writer and then a field journalist for Reuters.

37:14.217 --> 37:17.800
And for the past 3 and a half years
you've been solidly freelance...

37:17.883 --> 37:20.883
...living between London,
Istanbul and Paris.

37:20.967 --> 37:24.300
Well done. Yes. That's it.
You've really done your homework.

37:26.550 --> 37:29.050
People must worry about you
a lot doing this kind of work.

37:29.883 --> 37:31.967
Your wife? Children?

37:32.050 --> 37:33.300
No. Not married.

37:38.717 --> 37:40.300
What's it like going
to war just to watch?

37:40.342 --> 37:43.883
I'm not there to watch.
I'm there to…record.

37:43.918 --> 37:45.383
Is that how you got those scars?

37:46.967 --> 37:47.883
No.

37:50.717 --> 37:53.800
I fell off my bike when I was
12 coming down a gravel track...

37:54.675 --> 37:56.133
No other scars?

38:01.050 --> 38:02.758
Are you going to drink your macchiato?

38:11.967 --> 38:14.467
What's the hardest thing
you have to deal with?

38:14.550 --> 38:16.717
Jesus...Are these
going to get any easier?

38:19.133 --> 38:22.217
I don't know, finding a loo when you need one,
always seems to be pretty fucking impossible.

38:35.550 --> 38:38.050
Why don't you celebrate
your birthday on Christmas?

38:41.217 --> 38:43.092
Now tell me, which article
did you read that one in?

38:43.133 --> 38:45.383
It was your birthday when you
took that photo of that girl.

38:46.383 --> 38:47.883
The one you won the Pulitzer for.

38:48.217 --> 38:49.467
I was shortlisted.

38:49.717 --> 38:52.883
I read that when you got nominated...

38:54.383 --> 38:55.800
...you withdrew the entry.

38:56.300 --> 38:57.425
Long story.

39:05.467 --> 39:07.383
I've got a 120-minute tape.

39:18.008 --> 39:19.717
I was in Grozny.

39:20.883 --> 39:23.550
I heard about an offensive that was
being mounted against the Russians.

39:25.550 --> 39:27.217
I was warned by some friends
not to write about it in case...

39:27.300 --> 39:29.133
...the Russians caught whiff
about what was going to happen.

39:30.383 --> 39:31.967
- So what did you do?
- Wrote the article.

39:33.300 --> 39:35.717
Then I declined sending
it through to Reuters.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.300
They found out anyway.

39:38.967 --> 39:42.758
And they retaliated by massacring over 100
civilians in the village outside the city.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.633
And I'd been out all night
drinking with people...

39:46.717 --> 39:48.265
...who were killed a few hours later.

39:48.300 --> 39:52.300
The girl in the photo was
the... was the only survivor.

39:53.633 --> 39:55.508
- Did you know her?
- No.

39:58.050 --> 39:59.300
Was there anyone else around?

39:59.550 --> 40:01.050
Not at the time, no.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.050
- Just you?
- Just me

40:05.633 --> 40:06.717
So then what?

40:11.800 --> 40:13.633
I think your batteries are running flat.

40:24.050 --> 40:25.175
Are you...

40:26.133 --> 40:27.258
...Ben Steimer's daughter?

40:29.342 --> 40:31.175
- Did you know him?
- Yeah.

40:31.300 --> 40:32.383
We went to school together.

40:38.633 --> 40:40.383
- It's a photo of a baby.
- Whose?

40:41.300 --> 40:43.800
- I don't know. Do I mean to?
- Yeah, look at the bracelet.

40:48.967 --> 40:52.800
No. Look: "Celia
27th-2nd-87".

40:52.883 --> 40:54.717
That's roughly 8 months after I left.

41:04.133 --> 41:06.133
I sent that photo nearly 16 years ago.

41:06.300 --> 41:07.300
Why did you send it?

41:12.300 --> 41:13.383
Why did you send it Jax?

41:18.050 --> 41:19.467
You want an explanation?

41:23.883 --> 41:26.133
Do you know what's it
like to be invisible, Paul?

41:28.300 --> 41:30.133
Even just a postcard.

41:31.550 --> 41:32.550
A phone call.

41:35.467 --> 41:36.217
Hi, Sid...

41:36.300 --> 41:38.383
...up there next to the hoggets.

41:54.258 --> 41:55.633
It's in the past, okay?

41:57.133 --> 41:58.175
Just leave it.

42:12.383 --> 42:15.217
- Will you be needing a copy of that?
- No, thank you.

43:17.133 --> 43:19.800
I think I need to rescue
from these Kiwi Boys.

43:20.883 --> 43:22.217
Is a gook book is it?

43:23.300 --> 43:25.883
The Cloud of Unknowing,
it sounds mysterious.

43:26.967 --> 43:28.383
Where are you from?

43:29.050 --> 43:30.217
Where am I from?

43:32.175 --> 43:33.550
Along way from here.

43:34.633 --> 43:37.967
Me too. Might for join you?

43:41.550 --> 43:43.050
- Have a drink?
- OK.

44:06.550 --> 44:07.800
Kiss me.

45:17.300 --> 45:18.800
Am I warm?

45:24.050 --> 45:25.348
Getting closer.

45:25.383 --> 45:27.467
- Warmer?
- Getting warmer.

45:27.633 --> 45:29.133
Warmer?

45:29.883 --> 45:32.133
- Warmer, in springtime.
- Here.

45:57.217 --> 46:01.883
Alone we are born And die alone

46:02.800 --> 46:07.800
Yet see the red-gold cirrus
Over snow mountain shine

46:08.050 --> 46:12.217
Upon the upland road Ride easy, stranger

46:13.800 --> 46:17.300
Surrender to the sky Your heart of anger

46:19.717 --> 46:22.550
Don't be frightened
of possibilities son.

46:23.217 --> 46:25.217
She's a wonderful mistress.

47:08.883 --> 47:09.967
It's okay.

47:10.550 --> 47:11.717
It's okay...

47:49.883 --> 47:51.300
Go back to sleep.

48:18.300 --> 48:19.883
I'm helping out for a couple of weeks.

48:19.967 --> 48:23.467
And I'm new at this,
so be patient with me.

48:26.217 --> 48:28.717
Who knows how many words there
ar in the English language?

48:28.967 --> 48:31.217
- Ten thousand.
- Ten thousand?

48:33.967 --> 48:37.050
Dictionary. There's
actually over 750,000 words.

48:37.800 --> 48:40.883
And I was a...I thought maybe
you could all choose a word...

48:41.300 --> 48:43.467
...any word, doesn't matter what, preferably
something that means something to you...

48:43.633 --> 48:47.383
...and then compose something
on this word. Anything...

48:47.467 --> 48:49.717
It could be just a static image
of you if you think that's easier.

48:50.217 --> 48:54.050
But, just so I get an
idea of who you all are...

48:54.467 --> 48:56.633
...and what the fuck
I've gotten myself into.

50:08.550 --> 50:11.717
<i>Hope. Her mind is a graveyard.</i>

50:11.800 --> 50:13.467
<i>Her heart is an island.</i>

50:16.717 --> 50:18.050
<i>She and I are not good friends...</i>

50:18.133 --> 50:19.717
<i>...but I've known
her all my life.</i>

50:24.883 --> 50:27.300
<i>She sits in my belly
hollow and distant...</i>

50:27.883 --> 50:29.967
<i>...and her whispered
words of encouragement…</i>

50:30.050 --> 50:31.383
<i>...will never comfort me.</i>

50:33.550 --> 50:34.717
Mom?

50:43.467 --> 50:46.800
<i>I'm on to her tricks.
Her false promises.</i>

50:48.133 --> 50:49.217
<i>"Go away," I tell her.</i>

50:49.300 --> 50:51.717
<i>"I'm busy today… I've
got things to do."</i>

50:54.133 --> 50:57.133
<i>But this acquaintance
never knows when to leave.</i>

50:58.383 --> 50:59.967
<i>It's not a question of why she...</i>

51:00.050 --> 51:01.717
<i>...befriended me
in the first place.</i>

51:03.883 --> 51:06.800
<i>It's more a question of why
I choose to let her stay.</i>

51:48.883 --> 51:51.717
Teabag! Teabag!

51:52.050 --> 51:53.467
Go away, you animal!

51:56.133 --> 51:57.467
Come on babe!

51:57.550 --> 52:00.050
Be my whore in front of the camera.

53:45.133 --> 53:46.217
Your knee's bleeding.

53:47.050 --> 53:48.300
I know. I fell.

53:58.967 --> 54:00.300
Come on. Let's take a look at that.

54:33.633 --> 54:35.133
<i>Weeks passed...</i>

54:35.467 --> 54:37.717
<i>...and there was still
no sign of the ocean.</i>

54:40.633 --> 54:42.050
<i>The people grew worried.</i>

54:43.800 --> 54:46.383
<i>It was decided to send a small
group to search for it...</i>

54:47.133 --> 54:48.883
<i>...in the hope of
bringing it back.</i>

54:59.133 --> 55:00.550
All right, attention please.

55:01.883 --> 55:03.800
I'd appreciate it if everyone listened.

55:04.633 --> 55:06.133
It includes you, Mr. Brook

55:09.967 --> 55:12.217
Look. Have any of you
seen Celia since yesterday?

55:18.550 --> 55:21.383
No? Well, if she gets in
touch with any of you...

55:21.800 --> 55:24.383
..., you know where
to find me. OK? Thanks.

55:27.717 --> 55:30.717
All right. Settle down. We've
all seen a police officer before.

55:40.967 --> 55:41.515
- Paul.
- Hello.

55:41.550 --> 55:44.050
Look, Just wondering. Can
I have a word for a second?

55:44.383 --> 55:46.133
- I'm already late for a class.
- It won't take long.

55:47.217 --> 55:48.300
Back to class!

55:57.883 --> 55:59.967
Hey, Pat, It's fine. I'm just
helping out with something.

56:00.800 --> 56:01.633
Thanks Pat.

56:07.050 --> 56:09.217
Did you see Celia on the weekend?

56:11.050 --> 56:11.800
No.

56:13.133 --> 56:15.133
She used to visit though?

56:18.467 --> 56:19.300
Yeah.

56:21.800 --> 56:23.883
She came by sometimes to borrow books.

56:25.050 --> 56:26.383
How often did she pop by?

56:29.300 --> 56:33.133
She liked to drop by most
Sundays I guess, yeah.

56:34.883 --> 56:35.883
Liked?

56:36.050 --> 56:39.217
Likes. I said likes, I think.

56:39.467 --> 56:43.050
You see, cause I think
I know what Celia likes.

56:43.217 --> 56:44.967
I mean I've known her
since she was a little kid.

56:45.467 --> 56:47.133
She's my daughter's best friend.

56:48.300 --> 56:50.133
I also know that you sent her an e
- mail on the weekend...

56:50.217 --> 56:51.883
...asking her to come by and visit.

56:52.717 --> 56:54.883
She wasn't too happy about
that from what I understand.

56:56.967 --> 57:00.217
You see I know this Paul because
Miso agreed to drop her off.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.550
Actually she did drop by briefly.

57:06.050 --> 57:07.800
I don't know where did she go back.

57:09.800 --> 57:11.217
It's nice out there at the orchard.

57:11.633 --> 57:12.800
Quiet.

57:13.300 --> 57:14.217
Private.

57:19.133 --> 57:20.383
So why did you stay on?

57:21.883 --> 57:23.217
Favour for a friend.

57:26.050 --> 57:28.550
- How long did you guys go out for?
- What?

57:29.217 --> 57:30.050
Mom.

57:31.717 --> 57:33.967
Oh, she mentioned me.

57:34.800 --> 57:35.967
When did you break up?

57:37.217 --> 57:38.550
God, seventeen.

57:39.050 --> 57:40.717
- The way...
- Keep your leg still.

57:49.217 --> 57:50.883
Listen, what you wrote the other day...

57:50.967 --> 57:55.883
...I thought it was well considered.

57:57.633 --> 57:58.800
Well considered?

57:59.133 --> 58:00.300
Intriguing.

58:11.717 --> 58:13.383
I like what you've done here.

58:14.967 --> 58:16.217
Where did all these books come from?

58:17.800 --> 58:21.717
He never told me. Wanted to
keep it a mystery, I suppose.

58:21.752 --> 58:23.800
Father's have got a lot to answer for?

58:49.883 --> 58:50.967
Hey beautiful.

58:53.217 --> 58:54.300
Sorry I'm late.

59:15.967 --> 59:17.217
She can't have gone far.

59:25.217 --> 59:28.133
Me and some mates are going to
take a look around Lawrence later.

59:30.800 --> 59:31.800
Can you bring those?

59:34.467 --> 59:35.467
Sure.

59:38.217 --> 59:42.050
I asked for an essay about the pros and cons of
immigration, Jake, not the best places to surf.

59:43.550 --> 59:46.133
Louise, Tonga has a
king, not a president.

59:47.133 --> 59:50.133
I think you'll find there's more to
life in Hong Kong than dance clubs, Miso.

59:50.633 --> 59:52.633
What? Like secret book clubs?

01:00:00.633 --> 01:00:01.800
Paul?

01:00:06.633 --> 01:00:10.383
Sgt. O'Neill's back. He's waiting
for you in the common room.

01:00:11.467 --> 01:00:13.133
I told him you were busy.

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:22.217
You had nice handwriting as a kid.

01:00:25.967 --> 01:00:27.133
Is this one of the books she borrowed?

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:34.383
I didn't, I...I didn't keep a
record to tell you the truth...the...

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:38.133
What? Other things
on your mind, did you?

01:00:40.467 --> 01:00:43.550
We found this on the side of the road
the one that comes from your place.

01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:46.467
Just want to know how
it got there, that's all.

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:52.717
Did she ever talk to you about leaving?

01:00:53.967 --> 01:00:55.717
Name a teenager around here who doesn't.

01:00:57.717 --> 01:00:58.883
There are a few actually.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.133
- You'll make me walk in a tree.
- No, you will not.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.217
Stop.

01:01:41.133 --> 01:01:42.967
Okay, you can open your eyes.

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:46.550
Happy birthday.

01:01:56.467 --> 01:01:57.467
Who is this anyway?

01:01:58.467 --> 01:01:59.800
- Kiri Te Kanawa. You chose it.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.300
- Who's she?
- Who's she?

01:02:03.133 --> 01:02:05.133
There are people in this country...

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:07.217
...who would shoot you
for asking that question.

01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:08.633
There are people in this country...

01:02:08.717 --> 01:02:10.217
...who would shoot you
for listening to it.

01:02:11.383 --> 01:02:13.300
- Not that I can do such a thing.
- No?

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.383
So what's she singing about?

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:20.883
Love.

01:02:27.217 --> 01:02:28.633
What do you normally
do on a Saturday night?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.883
Who do you hang out with when
you're not having picnics with me?

01:02:32.133 --> 01:02:33.550
What do you do, go to parties or what?

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.383
If you can call them that.
Why do want to come along?

01:02:37.383 --> 01:02:38.883
You actually might get
to see them tea bagging.

01:02:39.383 --> 01:02:41.300
Tea bagging? What's that?

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:45.717
Well, That's when guys get
a girl completely comatose...

01:02:46.133 --> 01:02:49.550
...and then they take turns in lowering
their testicles into her eye sockets...

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:51.467
... and film it.

01:02:52.217 --> 01:02:54.633
And if they're really kind they
send a copy to a paranoid friend.

01:02:56.050 --> 01:02:57.383
First class excitement.

01:02:57.717 --> 01:02:59.217
It's not funny!

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.717
- I don't know what we're talking about.
- Oh God!

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:12.633
Well I hope you keep your distance from
those kind of guys is what I'm saying.

01:03:14.383 --> 01:03:18.550
So, tell me about you and Mom...

01:03:18.883 --> 01:03:19.967
...back in the dark ages.

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:22.050
It wasn't that long ago.

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:50.717
My Mom wanted to sing like this?

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:54.467
Your mother wanted to be Patti Smith...

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:48.800
Come with me. Come on.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.717
- I'll show you something.
- What?

01:05:08.717 --> 01:05:10.133
Where did this place come from?

01:05:13.133 --> 01:05:14.633
No one knows except my Dad.

01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:17.300
So what are you doing here?

01:05:18.633 --> 01:05:19.633
Write.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.133
Think.

01:05:25.967 --> 01:05:29.133
Mystery boy. So many secrets…

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.717
What are you doing?

01:05:40.133 --> 01:05:41.800
Giving you something
to write about, moron.

01:05:46.883 --> 01:05:48.133
Mom the rock star.

01:05:48.633 --> 01:05:50.383
It's hard to believe
she even had a dream.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.300
- Do you want to know what my dream is?
- Yeah.

01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:04.633
I'm sitting in a café in Spain.

01:06:07.633 --> 01:06:09.550
And don't know a single person there.

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:12.300
And I can't understand a single
word that anyone's saying.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.717
I've got a glass of wine.

01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:20.133
And I can see the sea.

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:29.883
- ...don't worry.
- No, go on. And?

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.550
I'm just writing.

01:06:38.758 --> 01:06:46.217
And….yeah. And you know, it doesn't matter
if no one ever reads what I'm writing.

01:06:46.717 --> 01:06:48.383
But, you know, I don't
want to be famous.

01:06:49.383 --> 01:06:51.633
I just…I just want to be there.

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:02.467
Anyway, I'd rather be
a no one somewhere...

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:05.633
...than someone nowhere.

01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:08.467
I've already packed my suitcase.

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.383
- I'm not joking.
- I'm not laughing at you.

01:07:15.217 --> 01:07:16.550
I had a similar dream once.

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.625
Really?

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.125
Tell me.

01:07:30.125 --> 01:07:31.583
Sometimes I'd see…

01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:33.458
...faces...

01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:36.542
..at night before I fell asleep...

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:39.292
...and people I'd never met.

01:07:41.417 --> 01:07:42.833
And I'd wonder who they were...

01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:45.917
... where they might
live, what they did.

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:50.500
It was strange because...

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:52.250
... it was like they knew
I was thinking about them.

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:57.417
Why did you become a war journalist?

01:08:01.417 --> 01:08:04.000
Who you set out to be is
not always who you become.

01:08:05.083 --> 01:08:06.833
You know, things happen, plans change...

01:08:13.542 --> 01:08:14.792
I see them too.

01:08:17.125 --> 01:08:18.167
Faces.

01:08:23.582 --> 01:08:24.792
I wanted to give you something.

01:08:33.792 --> 01:08:34.590
Yeah, right.

01:08:34.625 --> 01:08:38.042
I just...I think you should enter.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.417
You never talk about your Mom.

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:17.082
My Mom? She's very religious.

01:09:17.667 --> 01:09:20.582
She had these little sermons about the
beauty God hides away in quiet corners.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.125
Is that what your Dad
was hiding from in here.

01:09:24.707 --> 01:09:25.792
No, they...

01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:28.625
I think she was just quiet.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:32.625
My Dad and her were very different.

01:09:32.707 --> 01:09:34.917
My Dad didn't believe in
anything. He's an atheist.

01:09:35.625 --> 01:09:36.957
My brother and her were very close.

01:09:39.125 --> 01:09:40.332
I heard she had an accident.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:44.750
Yes she did. She…

01:09:44.792 --> 01:09:48.167
...she was diagnosed
bi-polar, manic-depression.

01:09:49.042 --> 01:09:52.042
And doctors prescribed lithium
but she stopped taking it.

01:09:53.582 --> 01:09:54.750
What happened?

01:10:00.083 --> 01:10:04.458
She was standing in the river at
the back of the property and...

01:10:04.542 --> 01:10:06.125
...she pointed up to
this hawk in the sky...

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:08.375
...and then when I
looked back she was gone.

01:10:09.208 --> 01:10:11.000
Found the body two days later.

01:10:17.417 --> 01:10:19.208
Is that why you push people away?

01:10:25.792 --> 01:10:27.875
I do as I fucking please, Celia.

01:10:28.042 --> 01:10:29.750
You know I hate to spoil
your illusions but...

01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:31.958
...the world out there...

01:10:32.042 --> 01:10:33.458
...isn't a bed of roses
waiting to be picked or….

01:10:33.542 --> 01:10:37.833
...what ever it was you said, a glass
of chardonnay in a fucking tapas bar.

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:40.875
You understand?

01:10:41.417 --> 01:10:42.667
It wasn't an insult.

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:49.917
Sorry.

01:10:54.958 --> 01:10:56.250
OK.

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:10.750
Hey Jax!

01:11:12.458 --> 01:11:16.833
Hi. I saw the smoke and I
didn't want to disturb you but...

01:11:16.917 --> 01:11:18.917
... I remembered it was
your birthday. So I...

01:11:33.583 --> 01:11:34.625
Get in the car!

01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:38.875
- No!
- Celia, I am sick of this.

01:11:38.958 --> 01:11:41.958
- Get in the car. When I said get in the car, get in the car!
- No!

01:11:44.792 --> 01:11:47.417
You have no right to be
here. Good night Paul.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:58.417
You have the audacity to bring
her here and give her alcohol?

01:11:58.542 --> 01:12:00.417
Jax, it's not what you think.

01:12:05.875 --> 01:12:07.792
You even presume to know what I think.

01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:23.875
Shit!

01:12:26.292 --> 01:12:27.458
Excuse me.

01:12:28.167 --> 01:12:31.958
I….need a notebook. I
know it's here somewhere.

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:36.667
I'm...sorry Dad.

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:38.208
There's nothing to be sorry for...

01:12:39.208 --> 01:12:42.250
- ...as long as you're being cautious.
- Yeah, of course.

01:12:43.042 --> 01:12:43.875
Allways.

01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:45.667
I'll be on my way.

01:12:54.083 --> 01:12:55.417
You shouldn't be here.

01:12:57.125 --> 01:12:58.208
He doesn't care.

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.417
I mean you saw for yourself.

01:13:01.708 --> 01:13:02.458
I care.

01:13:02.542 --> 01:13:05.083
What are you telling me? That
I'm not as important as...

01:13:05.167 --> 01:13:06.750
...what goes on in your head?

01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:09.958
There's just parts of me you can't have.

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:13.500
No one can.

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:26.292
- Hey. You're okay?
- Hý, hý!

01:13:28.542 --> 01:13:30.042
Get it back to your place.

01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:37.542
What's this?

01:13:42.208 --> 01:13:43.792
Jesus Christ.

01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:48.083
Did she do this? Celia
tell me, who did it?

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:52.875
I don't want to talk
about it. It wasn't Mom.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:58.708
Hey, where is he?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.458
- Paul, what are you doing?
- Where is he?

01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:03.042
- Paul, what're you doing in my house?
- Where is he, Jackie? - What's going on?

01:14:03.083 --> 01:14:04.542
- Is this the asshole?
- What?

01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:06.042
Who the fuck is this?

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:08.125
Just shut up, Gareth.
Paul would you leave?

01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:09.833
So this is the famous Paul.

01:14:11.208 --> 01:14:14.125
You like beating up little girls, do
you. You know it's assault, is what it is.

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.417
You touch her again. I'll kill you.

01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:17.750
Is that right mate?

01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:22.292
Yeah. What do you call it, dickhead?
I was minding my own fucking business.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.208
Fucking prick.

01:14:33.042 --> 01:14:36.625
Mind your fucking business.

01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:41.250
Cut your fuck off. Is that clear, hey?

01:14:42.292 --> 01:14:43.792
You still wanna fucking kill me, cunt?

01:14:43.875 --> 01:14:46.750
- Get the fuck inside! - He did fucking
start it…. - Get the fuck inside!

01:14:50.042 --> 01:14:51.042
Do you think you can come here and...

01:14:51.083 --> 01:14:52.708
...do this shit in front of my kids?

01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:55.417
Have you seen her fucking bruises?
What did you think I would do?

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:58.083
She got a lot more than she got.
I want you to stay away from her.

01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:00.750
You changed the birth certificate.

01:15:02.042 --> 01:15:03.292
When were you going to tell her?

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.458
Just stay out of our lives, all right?

01:15:15.333 --> 01:15:16.708
See you around Paul.

01:15:16.792 --> 01:15:18.000
You fucking prick.

01:15:25.042 --> 01:15:26.500
Hello... Hello...

01:15:29.875 --> 01:15:32.958
Hello... Celia?

01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:51.250
She might have gone to Spain.

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.667
No, no, no, wait. My daughter
plans on running off to Spain...

01:15:57.792 --> 01:15:59.500
...and he sees nothing, I
don't call that irrelevant.

01:15:59.583 --> 01:16:02.125
Come on Jackie it not like it's the
first time she's done something like this.

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:03.458
Oh, great.

01:16:04.542 --> 01:16:06.750
How good, this is good. So
you are defending him now?

01:16:08.875 --> 01:16:11.583
Okay, so when exactly did she
say she was running off to Spain?

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:13.833
She didn't. She didn't
say. All I knew is...

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:17.125
...she had the ticket. I thought she was
going to leave when school was finished.

01:16:17.167 --> 01:16:18.625
That's all. I didn't know what to think.

01:16:18.833 --> 01:16:22.125
Yeah. Well I know what I think.
I think you are out of your mind.

01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:24.708
She made me promise not to tell a soul.

01:16:26.042 --> 01:16:28.333
I'm her mother. Okay?

01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:32.375
When exactly did she
make this promise Paul?

01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:34.083
Was it when you were
plying her with alcohol?

01:16:34.208 --> 01:16:35.375
I wasn't plying her
with alcohol. I gave her

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.708
...a glass, Jackie. A
child could have drunk it.

01:16:37.792 --> 01:16:39.042
A child did drink it.

01:16:39.083 --> 01:16:42.667
Oh yeah. And did he think of that when he was
punching the shit out of her? And the rest.

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:43.583
Fuck off. Don't bring me into it.

01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:47.458
Sneaking up to her. Pissing in the
toilet while she is lying in the bath?

01:16:48.333 --> 01:16:51.042
If it took her going half way around the world
to get away from you, you fucking asshole.

01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:53.208
- You want a fucking bite?
- Don't!

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.417
You two stay in here.

01:16:55.875 --> 01:16:57.708
You, get in my office.
I want a word alone.

01:17:00.167 --> 01:17:02.042
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing.

01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:04.500
- What the fuck is he talking about?
- Nothing, nothing…

01:17:09.042 --> 01:17:11.333
Tell me about the last time
you saw her. Everything.

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:13.375
We were at the gate. She
was carrying the atlas.

01:17:13.917 --> 01:17:15.083
She said goodbye and she left.

01:17:15.417 --> 01:17:16.917
- No special goodbyes?
- No special goodbyes.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.167
No, she had a couple of books she hadn't got
around to reading and I told her she could keep.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.042
- Names of these books?
- Oh fuck! Say, what does it matter? I don't know.

01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:26.875
Owls Do Cry by Janet Frame and...

01:17:26.958 --> 01:17:30.208
...another one, Camus, The Outsider.

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:34.292
That's Camus not
canoe, C- A-M-U-S.

01:17:35.667 --> 01:17:37.833
You smug prick.

01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:40.125
Not all of us had to run
off to Europe, mate...

01:18:41.167 --> 01:18:42.667
I guess you've seen this.

01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:48.667
Small town bloody gossip.

01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:53.250
I don't know what to do about this Paul.

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:57.625
The board of trustees
have called a meeting.

01:19:01.125 --> 01:19:02.375
You don't deserve this.

01:19:03.625 --> 01:19:07.417
You know it's fine, Pat. It's
time I left anyway. Honestly.

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:14.208
Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan!

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.500
Jonathan! Hey, Jonathan! Get in.

01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:37.542
Jonathan, get in the
car, it's bloody freezing.

01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:40.333
Come on.

01:19:41.625 --> 01:19:42.708
Put your seat belt on.

01:19:48.125 --> 01:19:49.958
Were you having sex with her?

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:52.292
What?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.708
You know who.

01:20:00.875 --> 01:20:01.875
Who said that? Who said that?

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:04.500
Who?

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:09.958
Kids at school...

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
...said you were giving
her special coaching in bed.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.042
And you believed them?

01:20:26.333 --> 01:20:27.958
And you believed?

01:20:36.625 --> 01:20:39.167
How's that camera going? I
haven't seen you with it lately.

01:21:07.333 --> 01:21:11.167
<i>As the days went on, more
and more people went looking.</i>

01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:22.667
<i>The people searched far and wide.</i>

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:25.833
<i>But the ocean had
vanished without a trace.</i>

01:21:31.167 --> 01:21:33.875
<i>The quiet land once bountiful...</i>

01:21:34.083 --> 01:21:37.083
<i>...had become hard
and unyielding.</i>

01:21:46.875 --> 01:21:49.250
<i>Then a shape appeared
on the horizon.</i>

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:53.375
<i>Through a blaze of hate...</i>

01:21:53.417 --> 01:21:57.333
<i>..., the people saw what looked like
tumbling water rolling towards them.</i>

01:21:58.792 --> 01:22:01.458
<i>A wave of excitement
passed through the town...</i>

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:04.292
<i>...as they anxiously
watched the ocean return.</i>

01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:09.375
<i>But as it grew closer the shape
began to alter and mutate.</i>

01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:13.833
<i>What looked like
tumbling water...</i>

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.292
<i>... was in fact wild horses.</i>

01:22:17.708 --> 01:22:21.750
<i>Everywhere they turned, they saw
horses drawing closer and closer.</i>

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:27.000
<i>Their excitement turned to fear.</i>

01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:30.125
<i>And their fear became panic...</i>

01:22:31.083 --> 01:22:33.458
<i>...for it seemed that nothing
could stop their advance.</i>

01:22:36.083 --> 01:22:38.292
<i>Which as the ocean's
disappearance...</i>

01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:40.625
<i>...had come without warning.</i>

01:22:44.708 --> 01:22:46.208
<i>But then no one...</i>

01:22:46.917 --> 01:22:48.375
<i>...not even for a moment...</i>

01:22:48.458 --> 01:22:52.292
<i>..., had stopped to question why the
ocean had left in the first place.</i>

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:10.708
Mr. Prior.

01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:14.042
I am Detective Inspector
Farnon from Wellington C.I.V.

01:23:14.667 --> 01:23:16.125
This is Detective Dunleavy.

01:23:16.542 --> 01:23:18.792
I have a warrant to
search these premises...

01:23:18.875 --> 01:23:21.417
...and I'll need you to accompany
me to the station for questioning.

01:23:23.917 --> 01:23:26.125
I'll need your passport
and keys to your car.

01:23:28.792 --> 01:23:32.542
I believe there's a shed
where Celia used to visit you.

01:23:41.958 --> 01:23:43.792
Right then, let's get you home.

01:24:04.042 --> 01:24:06.500
Why did Celia come to
your place last Sunday?

01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:12.250
- Did you hear the question?
- Yes.

01:24:13.667 --> 01:24:16.125
I understand that she
visited you regularly.

01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:18.792
What was the nature of the visits?

01:24:19.583 --> 01:24:21.583
- We talked about things.
- What things?

01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:23.000
Europe.

01:24:24.042 --> 01:24:24.875
Books.

01:24:27.625 --> 01:24:29.208
Celia wants to be a writer.

01:24:41.125 --> 01:24:45.208
<i>I am not flesh. I am not blood.
They can look all they like...</i>

01:24:45.292 --> 01:24:47.833
<i>...but they'll never see me.
If I never hear your love...</i>

01:24:47.917 --> 01:24:52.750
<i>...or hold your hand again in this life,
promise me we will touch when I am dead.</i>

01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:57.208
It's called "Poem for a Lonely Friend".

01:24:59.333 --> 01:25:01.708
Would you consider yourself lonely Paul?

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:12.333
Thank you.

01:25:13.833 --> 01:25:15.958
Would you keep that door closed please?

01:25:21.875 --> 01:25:24.958
Why did Celia keep visiting you even
though her parents had forbidden it?

01:25:25.042 --> 01:25:27.083
- Parents?
- Mother.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.083
I guess she saw something in me.

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:31.792
And what was that?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.167
Well, I'm not Celia.

01:25:35.042 --> 01:25:37.750
Then perhaps you'd like to tell
me what it was you saw in her?

01:25:41.292 --> 01:25:43.042
I know this is diffi...

01:25:46.833 --> 01:25:48.667
I remember being her.

01:26:01.917 --> 01:26:03.708
Fuck off! Fuck you!

01:26:07.208 --> 01:26:08.375
What did you do this time?

01:26:09.208 --> 01:26:11.250
Come on leave me alone now. Go away.

01:26:13.292 --> 01:26:15.333
Just fucking go.

01:26:15.375 --> 01:26:18.750
- Come on, leave me alone. I don't need this shit, Celia. Just…..go.
- What?

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:20.798
Did Mom say something to you?

01:26:20.833 --> 01:26:23.167
Your Mom threatened to
ring the school, yeah. Okay?

01:26:23.792 --> 01:26:25.417
No it's not okay.

01:26:26.167 --> 01:26:28.625
God she's so fucking presumptuous.

01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:32.250
Who the fuck cares what she thinks?

01:26:32.792 --> 01:26:34.083
She's got a fucking boyfriend.

01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:38.167
He wears boat shoes. He bought her a
pair and now they're both wearing them.

01:26:39.125 --> 01:26:41.250
You never see a fucking
boat around here.

01:26:47.917 --> 01:26:50.000
I just came to tell you
that I entered the contest.

01:26:50.083 --> 01:26:51.417
Well that's great, now get going.

01:26:51.625 --> 01:26:54.542
It's not like we're
friends or something, Paul.

01:26:58.083 --> 01:27:00.250
That was you who said
that we shouldn't care...

01:27:00.333 --> 01:27:02.417
...what other people think of us?

01:27:09.583 --> 01:27:10.667
Or were you just saying that?

01:27:52.875 --> 01:27:54.542
...how you and Mom used to go out...

01:27:54.625 --> 01:27:56.167
...and now it's me and
you that are friends?

01:27:59.583 --> 01:28:01.917
I feel like I've known
you my whole life.

01:28:02.958 --> 01:28:04.500
Yeah, well it's a small world.

01:28:05.042 --> 01:28:06.583
No, it isn't a small world.

01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:12.375
Were you guys in love?

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:20.417
There must've been something going
on if you tattooed each others feet.

01:28:23.917 --> 01:28:26.000
It's a little hard to
imagine what you saw in her.

01:28:26.250 --> 01:28:28.542
Well, you're not the first person
to feel that way about their parents.

01:28:30.625 --> 01:28:32.000
Anyway it's a long time ago.

01:28:36.042 --> 01:28:37.458
When I was implant...

01:28:39.167 --> 01:28:40.583
...Mum was only sixteen.

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:50.292
You'd tell me if you knew anything?

01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:00.208
Is that a promise?

01:29:07.417 --> 01:29:08.417
Oh stuff it.

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.625
Let's get wet. Come on.

01:29:55.458 --> 01:29:57.958
Oh geez! Andrew...Jonathan…

01:29:59.042 --> 01:30:02.542
We were on our way home from church
and thought we'd stop for a cuppa.

01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:03.875
Fuck!

01:30:05.417 --> 01:30:06.917
It's freezing!

01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:19.125
Have you seen this new
thing that they're building?

01:30:19.583 --> 01:30:22.125
It looks like a giant barn.

01:30:25.125 --> 01:30:26.583
I'm gonna to go to the bathroom.

01:30:36.917 --> 01:30:38.250
I'll put the kettle on.

01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:54.167
<i>Family and friends
of Celia Steimer...</i>

01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:56.958
<i>... are doing everything possible to help
police find her. More than 50 volunteers...</i>

01:30:57.042 --> 01:31:00.542
<i>...are now scouring waterways and
bushlands in the Marshall Road forest.</i>

01:31:00.833 --> 01:31:05.333
<i>The 16 year old Rapari Junction H.S. student
has been missing now for more than a week.</i>

01:31:05.917 --> 01:31:07.542
<i>D.I. Robin Farland says...</i>

01:31:07.625 --> 01:31:10.000
<i>... they have to
consider every option.</i>

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.833
<i>She acknowledged a local man...</i>

01:31:11.875 --> 01:31:13.375
<i>... is helping them
with their inquiries...</i>

01:31:13.667 --> 01:31:17.167
<i>...and the police will also be
visiting every house in the area.</i>

01:31:34.458 --> 01:31:35.833
He'll be fine.

01:31:36.875 --> 01:31:38.375
Let them handle it.

01:32:24.667 --> 01:32:26.708
- Please just use an ashtray.
- Okay.

01:32:28.208 --> 01:32:30.667
Listen, I spoke to the
lawyer in Alexandra...

01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:33.458
...and he reckons he's handled
this sort of thing before, so.

01:32:34.375 --> 01:32:36.583
He wants you to give him a
call first thing in the morning.

01:32:38.042 --> 01:32:39.000
Hey, what…

01:32:41.042 --> 01:32:43.875
What sexual position creates
the ugliest offspring?

01:32:47.542 --> 01:32:49.667
- What sexual position creates...
- I don't know Paul.

01:32:51.167 --> 01:32:52.250
Ask your mother!

01:32:56.083 --> 01:32:57.583
Can you imagine if she saw
us now? Can you imagine that?

01:32:58.583 --> 01:33:00.250
What do you think she'd say?

01:33:01.917 --> 01:33:03.875
Two brothers having a drink and a chat.

01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:06.083
What do think? She'd be proud, or what?

01:33:09.917 --> 01:33:11.792
- Why are you doing this, Paul?
- Doing what?

01:33:12.958 --> 01:33:15.083
- You know exactly what.
- Why can't you just talk to me?

01:33:24.125 --> 01:33:24.958
Fuck you.

01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:30.833
What the fuck are you looking at?
Never seen two brothers talking before?

01:33:38.958 --> 01:33:40.292
You want to talk, let's talk.

01:33:41.042 --> 01:33:43.833
Forget the fact you come in here
blind drunk and interrupt a meeting...

01:33:43.917 --> 01:33:47.583
...but then you just bring up Mom
like that? I mean, how dare you?

01:33:47.708 --> 01:33:49.833
I realize you are in
a spot of bother Paul...

01:33:49.917 --> 01:33:53.125
...but that doesn't give you the
right to behave like this. The truth?

01:33:53.792 --> 01:33:56.208
You were never there for Mom when
mom was sick. Where the hell were you?

01:33:56.625 --> 01:33:59.708
Brilliant. So you do have an opinion. OK
Andrew. What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

01:33:59.917 --> 01:34:01.083
I couldn't get near her.

01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:04.208
Blame it all on me. I had to be
you. Did you know that? And she...

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:05.840
You made fucking sure of it.

01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:09.625
A happy little fucking threesome:
Andy, Mom and God. Noone else invited.

01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:12.208
You were begged to do it.
You were begged to do it Paul.

01:34:12.333 --> 01:34:14.125
And you never took one
single step towards her.

01:34:14.250 --> 01:34:15.958
I never want when Dad turned
to the booze, you know,...

01:34:16.042 --> 01:34:18.250
...at least for all his faults,
he let me in. He let me in Andrew.

01:34:18.375 --> 01:34:20.167
I was the one who made
his funeral, remember?

01:34:20.250 --> 01:34:23.417
Do you understand? You've always
thinked that man. You listen to me Paul.

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:24.667
You listen, listen to me.

01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:28.083
You know sometimes I look at you...

01:34:29.042 --> 01:34:30.208
...and all I see is him.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:33.167
Just him.

01:34:34.125 --> 01:34:35.833
I find that quite disheartening.

01:34:41.792 --> 01:34:44.000
Yeah, well, at least I didn't
marry my fucking mother.

01:34:50.792 --> 01:34:52.750
She's always been like that or
was it just when she met you?

01:34:55.042 --> 01:34:56.208
Go to hell Paul.

01:36:47.708 --> 01:36:49.167
- Just open it.
- No.

01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:52.042
- Give...the letter to me.
- No.

01:36:52.833 --> 01:36:55.250
- Celia, give me the fucking letter
- No...!

01:36:57.875 --> 01:36:59.042
It doesn't matter.

01:37:12.667 --> 01:37:14.458
Open it. Will you just open it?

01:37:14.542 --> 01:37:15.542
No. You open it.

01:37:16.208 --> 01:37:18.083
- Open it.
- I don't want to.

01:37:24.833 --> 01:37:25.875
- Ha?
- No.

01:37:47.167 --> 01:37:48.333
One day confused...

01:38:01.708 --> 01:38:03.625
Amid the 2000 or so entries we were...

01:38:03.667 --> 01:38:05.542
...delighted with Ms Steimer's story.

01:38:05.917 --> 01:38:09.167
This work shows an emerging
remarkable talent for someone so young.

01:38:09.208 --> 01:38:11.792
It catches a sense of
beauty, mystery and loss...

01:38:11.875 --> 01:38:14.458
...without ever losing
sight of what might be.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.500
I wonder who came in first.

01:38:21.083 --> 01:38:22.958
I'll tell you who came first.

01:38:23.125 --> 01:38:26.208
Someone three times your probably, someone
who bloody well deserved to come first.

01:38:43.458 --> 01:38:45.250
Thank you for making it special for me.

01:38:49.625 --> 01:38:51.000
The den and everything.

01:39:03.375 --> 01:39:05.583
I need a cigarette to cope
with this sort of scenery.

01:39:07.083 --> 01:39:08.500
In the car. I'll be back in a tic.

01:39:09.167 --> 01:39:10.333
Can you leave me your jacket?

01:40:14.542 --> 01:40:16.083
Are you going to be home tonight?

01:40:16.583 --> 01:40:18.250
I need you to baby sit Sam.

01:40:22.542 --> 01:40:24.250
Celia, I asked you a question?

01:40:40.125 --> 01:40:41.375
Fuck!

01:41:07.583 --> 01:41:09.250
Is he my father?

01:41:19.375 --> 01:41:21.000
I wish it were that simple.

01:41:33.583 --> 01:41:34.417
Hey! You!

01:41:39.042 --> 01:41:40.042
What's up?

01:41:59.708 --> 01:42:01.125
Did you know?

01:42:03.167 --> 01:42:04.542
Did you know?

01:42:05.375 --> 01:42:10.250
- Answer me! Did you know?
- Ah, Celia...

01:42:17.167 --> 01:42:19.458
I know what you did when you
took the photo of that girl.

01:42:21.375 --> 01:42:23.250
You walked away and left her.

01:42:23.667 --> 01:42:25.042
That's why you withdrew the entry...

01:42:25.125 --> 01:42:26.708
...so you wouldn't even
have to deal with her.

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:29.167
- You don't know...
- Don't.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.375
Was she just another photo?

01:42:34.833 --> 01:42:37.292
Just another picture of
this fucking war puzzle...

01:42:37.333 --> 01:42:38.792
...that you try to figure out?

01:42:41.958 --> 01:42:43.333
Was she just like me?

01:42:44.542 --> 01:42:47.375
Was she just like me?
Was she just someone...

01:42:47.458 --> 01:42:50.375
...you could pick up and
throw away and forget about?

01:43:00.917 --> 01:43:02.833
How do you live with yourself?

01:43:21.458 --> 01:43:22.208
Andrew!

01:43:23.083 --> 01:43:24.833
Penny, are you there?

01:43:28.042 --> 01:43:29.625
Will you just open the door?

01:43:32.583 --> 01:43:35.208
I just need somewhere to stay.

01:43:40.708 --> 01:43:42.417
Come on Penny, I know you're in there.

01:44:05.375 --> 01:44:07.208
You know Jonathan all
that stuff in the papers...

01:44:08.292 --> 01:44:09.875
...that's all just speculation.

01:44:10.417 --> 01:44:11.417
All right? That's...

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:14.208
...It's rubbish. They have no proof.

01:44:20.917 --> 01:44:21.917
I'm still your uncle

01:44:28.917 --> 01:44:30.167
No you're not.

01:44:30.375 --> 01:44:32.167
Do you think we're both fucking stupid?

01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:34.333
- What did you say?
- Leave me alone!

01:44:34.833 --> 01:44:35.917
I hope they kill you.

01:44:36.083 --> 01:44:37.333
I hope they...

01:44:37.417 --> 01:44:38.583
Why did you do?

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.792
- Why did you do?
- It's OK, it's OK. It's allright.

01:44:48.167 --> 01:44:49.167
It's all right. I know you like her.

01:44:49.792 --> 01:44:52.583
I know you like her. It's all right.

01:44:54.583 --> 01:44:57.667
Listen you have to tell me
what you meant by "both of you".

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.042
Look at me. What did you mean
"both of us think you're stupid"?

01:45:01.833 --> 01:45:06.083
Tell me what you meant by both of us? I'm not going
to hurt you. I promise I'm not going to hurt you.

01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:13.750
What is it Jonathan?

01:45:15.333 --> 01:45:16.875
I was looking for my camera.

01:45:41.917 --> 01:45:44.000
I thought he was hiding
it to protect you.

01:45:49.667 --> 01:45:50.750
Where is he?

01:45:51.417 --> 01:45:53.792
In Christchurch 'til tomorrow.

01:46:06.083 --> 01:46:09.750
Paul? Paul, are you there?

01:46:28.875 --> 01:46:30.042
I just heard from the lawyer.

01:46:31.208 --> 01:46:32.542
What do you mean you don't want to sell?

01:46:33.250 --> 01:46:34.958
You can't. I'm up to my eyeballs...

01:46:39.208 --> 01:46:41.500
- What the hell did you do that for?
- Get up!

01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:43.750
Get up!

01:46:48.167 --> 01:46:51.458
What were you going to do? Plant
it at my place like the atlas?

01:46:51.542 --> 01:46:55.042
This is really unnecessary. Okay. Okay.

01:47:02.875 --> 01:47:05.000
There was a time I wondered
why you up and left.

01:47:06.792 --> 01:47:08.292
You knew what he was up to, didn't you?

01:47:09.667 --> 01:47:10.833
At least look at me and tell me...

01:47:10.917 --> 01:47:12.333
...you didn't know before
you pull that trigger.

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:18.708
You know the really sad part?

01:47:20.583 --> 01:47:22.625
I didn't even find out
until I read the will.

01:47:23.167 --> 01:47:27.917
That's how far back I was. But
then how was I to know Paul?

01:47:28.458 --> 01:47:30.583
I was only a kid, a 15 year old kid.

01:47:32.250 --> 01:47:33.667
You killed me when you
walked away and left me...

01:47:33.708 --> 01:47:35.583
...with that evil piece of scum.

01:47:35.667 --> 01:47:40.208
You think you even get a second
fucking chance? You knew you bastard.

01:47:40.542 --> 01:47:44.125
And you had the gall to come back here
and bring that thing into our house.

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:45.750
My mother's house!

01:47:46.792 --> 01:47:48.125
And God knows what
you're doing with her...

01:47:48.167 --> 01:47:49.833
...but then like father like son.

01:47:49.875 --> 01:47:51.667
Andrew, you don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

01:48:02.667 --> 01:48:04.750
He was screwing that
teenage whore of yours.

01:48:04.917 --> 01:48:06.396
- No!
- He was. You knew it.

01:48:06.431 --> 01:48:07.875
- No!
- And you walked...

01:48:07.958 --> 01:48:08.792
Andrew no!

01:48:08.833 --> 01:48:10.083
It's got nothing to do with you.

01:48:10.167 --> 01:48:11.583
You saw it with your own eyes.

01:48:11.833 --> 01:48:14.125
You knew and you walked
and you never looked back.

01:48:14.208 --> 01:48:15.042
What did you do to her?

01:48:15.083 --> 01:48:17.708
Our mother died the moment
that bastard was conceived.

01:48:17.833 --> 01:48:18.667
Just tell me.

01:48:22.917 --> 01:48:26.917
<i>Wherefore come out from among them,
and be separated, said the Lord.</i>

01:48:26.958 --> 01:48:31.708
<i>And touch not the unclean thing.</i>

01:48:40.083 --> 01:48:41.667
Mom!

01:48:43.375 --> 01:48:44.458
Tell me.

01:48:44.667 --> 01:48:47.458
Go ahead and cry. It's about
time you cried for our mother.

01:48:47.667 --> 01:48:49.500
I'll kill you. I fucking
swear I'll kill you.

01:48:53.208 --> 01:48:54.375
I told her everything.

01:48:55.375 --> 01:48:56.375
Everything.

01:48:57.667 --> 01:48:59.333
Someone had to set the record straight.

01:49:00.875 --> 01:49:02.792
I had a right to that money, Paul.

01:49:03.125 --> 01:49:05.333
That money was mine if
nothing else, at least that...

01:49:09.958 --> 01:49:13.250
And I should give her a third at
18 along with a nice little letter.

01:49:14.625 --> 01:49:15.708
Rather convenient, hey!

01:49:16.542 --> 01:49:17.542
Nice and smooth.

01:49:19.667 --> 01:49:20.833
She wanted proof.

01:49:24.625 --> 01:49:26.125
She asked to see the will.

01:49:30.958 --> 01:49:31.958
Wait here.

01:49:44.333 --> 01:49:45.542
Mom was there.

01:49:48.458 --> 01:49:49.542
What?

01:49:53.958 --> 01:49:54.958
What?

01:50:28.417 --> 01:50:29.583
What are you doing in here?

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.958
I was just looking.

01:50:32.708 --> 01:50:33.792
Who are you?

01:50:34.667 --> 01:50:35.833
He brought me here.

01:50:41.417 --> 01:50:42.667
I know what you are.

01:50:43.208 --> 01:50:45.250
You have no right to be in my house.

01:50:46.417 --> 01:50:49.583
I want you to stay away from
my family. Is that clear?

01:50:49.667 --> 01:50:50.667
Stay away.

01:50:55.042 --> 01:50:56.583
So he told you about me.

01:51:00.458 --> 01:51:01.708
Haven't you told her?

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.500
I told you to wait outside.

01:51:09.667 --> 01:51:11.167
Is it true, Andrew?

01:51:24.292 --> 01:51:25.792
You people.

01:51:27.458 --> 01:51:28.458
Get out!

01:51:40.083 --> 01:51:41.583
She smiled, Paul.

01:51:43.542 --> 01:51:45.083
Simple misunderstanding.

01:51:47.917 --> 01:51:49.250
What's done is done...

01:52:02.542 --> 01:52:04.792
For what it's worth,
Mom wants it this way.

01:54:02.792 --> 01:54:04.125
Uncle Paul.

01:54:04.708 --> 01:54:05.875
Jonathan?

01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:08.000
Can you come over?

01:55:14.292 --> 01:55:15.708
I rang the police.

01:55:16.333 --> 01:55:17.917
Am I in trouble?

01:55:32.625 --> 01:55:33.958
No you're not.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Paul wait...

01:57:18.292 --> 01:57:19.292
Paul wait...

01:57:21.292 --> 01:57:22.917
Paul come back home...

01:57:24.917 --> 01:57:26.417
Paul don't leave... Paul…

01:57:44.917 --> 01:57:46.875
<i>The people had no
choice but to trust...</i>

01:57:46.917 --> 01:57:49.375
<i>...that the horses would
lead them to their ocean.</i>

01:57:54.667 --> 01:57:56.625
<i>Without reins or saddles...</i>

01:57:56.708 --> 01:57:59.500
<i>...they rode the horses
across the barren land.</i>

01:58:08.083 --> 01:58:10.208
<i>But the ocean had
disappeared for good.</i>

01:58:18.875 --> 01:58:21.542
<i>And the people,
together and alone...</i>

01:58:22.292 --> 01:58:25.250
<i>...had no choice but to face
each other in their loss.</i>

01:58:27.542 --> 01:58:30.167
<i>They made a home for themselves
in a new environment.</i>

01:58:31.667 --> 01:58:33.750
<i>Although one that
had changed forever.</i>

01:58:37.125 --> 01:58:39.667
<i>They learnt to live in the
space the ocean had left.</i>

01:58:45.958 --> 01:58:48.250
<i>Although it lingered
in their dreams.</i>

01:58:58.042 --> 01:59:03.167
- Celia! - Your e-mail
said it was urgent.

01:59:06.375 --> 01:59:10.125
Yeah, I…I just wanted to see you.

01:59:11.708 --> 01:59:13.083
I've just been reading your story.

01:59:15.958 --> 01:59:17.542
So, you want to come
in? Have a cup of tea?

01:59:21.917 --> 01:59:23.167
I'll make you a macchiato.

01:59:28.667 --> 01:59:29.750
I wanted to give you this.

01:59:32.708 --> 01:59:33.958
It's a bit out of date.

01:59:34.125 --> 01:59:36.667
I don't think the world has
changed that much in 25 years.

01:59:39.625 --> 01:59:41.125
Have a look inside.

01:59:51.458 --> 01:59:53.333
- What's this?
- What do you think it is?

01:59:56.708 --> 01:59:59.500
It's open. So you can
use it anytime you like.

02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:01.875
You can leave after schools finished.

02:00:08.833 --> 02:00:12.250
Hey, Celia, this is not some pathetic
attempt to make everything all right.

02:00:12.583 --> 02:00:16.708
It's….It's just...

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.375
...the ticket is just a gift.

02:00:25.333 --> 02:00:28.750
You knew about Mom and
your father together.

02:00:32.208 --> 02:00:33.375
But I didn't know about you.

02:00:38.958 --> 02:00:40.458
Why didn't you just tell me?

02:00:40.583 --> 02:00:41.583
I didn't know how.

02:00:44.083 --> 02:00:45.083
I'm sorry.

02:00:52.458 --> 02:00:53.292
Look.

02:00:57.083 --> 02:00:58.083
In Spain...

02:01:00.458 --> 02:01:02.917
..., there's a place called Andalusia.

02:01:04.958 --> 02:01:07.083
It's hot and it's white and dusty.

02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:09.875
And you can see the ocean.

02:01:10.167 --> 02:01:13.667
This is it.

02:01:23.792 --> 02:01:25.083
I can drive you home.

02:01:25.250 --> 02:01:27.000
It's okay. I can walk.

02:01:34.625 --> 02:01:35.625
Hey Paul,...

02:01:38.833 --> 02:01:39.667
...about the ticket...

02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:41.500
Don't worry about it, of course.

02:01:42.167 --> 02:01:42.917
Promise?

02:01:43.125 --> 02:01:45.333
Yeah, it's our secret.

02:01:47.792 --> 02:01:50.042
Es nuestro secreto.

02:01:51.875 --> 02:01:53.375
I thought you couldn't speak Spanish.

02:02:04.958 --> 02:02:06.292
Adios brother.
