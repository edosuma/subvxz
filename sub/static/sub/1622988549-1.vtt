00:17.526 --> 00:19.696
Sam, Sam, listen.

00:19.729 --> 00:21.396
Sam, Sam, look at me.

00:21.430 --> 00:22.832
- Sam, Sam, look at me.
- Everything's gonna be fine,

00:22.865 --> 00:24.566
- Barry.
- Don't do this, Sam.

00:24.601 --> 00:26.736
Sam, listen to me,
look at me, Sam.

00:26.769 --> 00:28.671
Sam, look at me.

00:31.173 --> 00:33.576
Sammy, don't do this,
please, Sam, don't do this.

00:33.610 --> 00:35.678
Please, Sam, don't do this!

00:35.712 --> 00:38.313
Sam, please,
don't do this, please.

00:38.347 --> 00:40.282
No!

00:40.315 --> 00:42.317
Do you trust me?

00:46.288 --> 00:49.291
You'll never know my potential
if you don't give me the chance.

01:02.705 --> 01:05.574
- No.
- Isn't it wiser to use me?

01:05.608 --> 01:07.944
If not, you'll lose everything.

01:07.977 --> 01:09.846
- No.
- Think of your wife.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.369
- Lilly.
- Please stay there.

02:07.402 --> 02:09.270
Don't you think she needs this?

02:09.304 --> 02:11.007
I need some explanation.

02:11.039 --> 02:14.242
Some reason for all of this.

02:14.276 --> 02:16.679
Finding myself here early
and waiting for an answer

02:16.713 --> 02:19.816
is all I can remember.

02:19.849 --> 02:23.485
Never expected
to see you like this.

02:23.518 --> 02:26.321
It seems impossible.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.690
You said "early."

02:31.326 --> 02:33.462
That can't be.

02:33.495 --> 02:35.263
Are you saying that I'm dead?

02:37.867 --> 02:39.035
No!

02:40.703 --> 02:41.871
No!

02:43.438 --> 02:44.607
No!

02:45.942 --> 02:47.844
No!

02:47.877 --> 02:50.445
Please, don't do this!

02:53.381 --> 02:55.852
No!

02:55.885 --> 02:58.921
Help me out of here!

02:58.955 --> 03:01.556
Help!

03:01.591 --> 03:03.492
No!

04:03.552 --> 04:05.955
I tried to save you,

04:05.988 --> 04:07.857
but I was deceived.

04:09.759 --> 04:12.595
As soon as I tried
to save your life,

04:12.628 --> 04:14.730
you were taken from me.

04:14.764 --> 04:16.766
I don't understand.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.466
Saved me how?

04:20.736 --> 04:22.437
I don't wanna hear your excuses.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.407
I only wanna hear what
you have to say for yourself.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.876
- None of this makes any sense.
- I'm not here

04:26.909 --> 04:28.945
to dodge any bullets.

04:28.978 --> 04:32.815
I've been waiting for a chance
to explain everything to you.

04:32.849 --> 04:34.449
And I feel like
the more that you know,

04:34.482 --> 04:37.485
you will grow
in understanding and trust.

04:37.519 --> 04:38.988
Just like I did.

04:52.201 --> 04:54.770
It all began when everybody
started talking about

04:54.804 --> 04:57.006
this life-saving antidote.

04:57.039 --> 04:58.774
An antidote?

04:58.808 --> 05:00.910
Well, ironically
it was disguised.

05:00.943 --> 05:04.412
Something that would take lives

05:04.446 --> 05:05.781
turned into something
that could save...

05:05.815 --> 05:08.550
In "disguise,"
what do you mean by that?

05:10.186 --> 05:12.588
Bullets, Lillian.

05:31.473 --> 05:32.775
I don't know
if this is the right time

05:32.808 --> 05:34.777
- to bring this up, but...
- What is it?

05:36.946 --> 05:40.783
I'm your mom, I'll always be
your mom no matter what,

05:40.816 --> 05:43.185
and every mother
will do anything

05:43.219 --> 05:45.888
to make their daughter happy.

05:45.922 --> 05:47.857
Right?

05:50.726 --> 05:52.028
There's just something
about your death

05:52.061 --> 05:53.461
I think that you should know.

05:55.164 --> 05:57.833
There was a man

05:57.867 --> 05:59.702
who came to me.

06:04.674 --> 06:06.676
He had a bullet.

06:06.709 --> 06:10.146
And this wasn't a bullet that
you could buy at the store.

06:10.179 --> 06:13.716
I didn't really know him
back then when he came to me.

06:13.749 --> 06:15.851
We weren't close or anything,

06:15.885 --> 06:20.555
and he had a bullet, claiming
that this bullet could talk.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.259
I mean, Lilly, come on,
a talking bullet.

06:25.294 --> 06:27.129
But listen.

06:27.163 --> 06:28.931
He's good.

06:28.965 --> 06:30.833
He's really good.

06:34.870 --> 06:37.873
I just think about
all of the lives,

06:37.907 --> 06:41.911
all of the stories of the lives
that were being saved.

06:47.683 --> 06:50.720
At first these were
just stories to me.

06:50.753 --> 06:52.520
But these stories...

06:52.554 --> 06:53.956
these stories
made me realize that I had

06:53.990 --> 06:55.891
taken life for granted,

06:55.925 --> 06:58.127
and I watched these stories.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.196
I watched them come true

07:00.229 --> 07:02.832
right before my very eyes.

07:02.865 --> 07:05.835
And the old man,
he was really convincing.

07:05.868 --> 07:09.571
He was sweet and kind,
and so easy to trust.

07:09.605 --> 07:12.108
He chose to save you
over his very own wife.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.889
His own wife?

07:26.922 --> 07:28.958
His own wife was very sick.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.227
She had people
coming to the house to help.

07:31.260 --> 07:33.863
- Like I did.
- Yeah.

07:33.896 --> 07:35.898
I never knew about her, though,

07:35.931 --> 07:38.134
before everything.

07:38.167 --> 07:41.871
They had many good people
coming by the house to help,

07:41.904 --> 07:44.807
- but you don't come back from...
- Wait, then the old man

07:44.840 --> 07:48.711
had never used the bullet
for as long as he's had it.

07:48.744 --> 07:50.346
How long has he had it for?

08:00.656 --> 08:03.859
I don't know, it was easy
to overlook at the time.

08:03.893 --> 08:06.328
It wasn't what I was focused on.

08:06.362 --> 08:08.597
You see, I needed her.

08:08.631 --> 08:10.299
She started talking to me,

08:10.332 --> 08:12.068
and I heard her,
and she said that

08:12.101 --> 08:13.903
she would make
everything right, Lillian.

08:13.936 --> 08:15.738
That she would make
everything right for us.

08:21.677 --> 08:23.245
Who is she?

08:25.748 --> 08:27.083
The bullet.

08:28.984 --> 08:30.386
Then what happened?

08:34.924 --> 08:36.325
It didn't work.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.070
It wasn't what they said it was.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.640
- So, it was you?
- No.

08:51.674 --> 08:53.242
- You did it to me.
- No, no.

08:53.275 --> 08:54.977
You killed me.

09:00.316 --> 09:01.917
I must've been a burden for you.

09:01.951 --> 09:04.086
No, you were never
a burden to me.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.755
- I'm your mother.
- You were my mother.

09:06.789 --> 09:09.091
You were never a burden to me.

09:09.125 --> 09:12.728
I was prepared to take
any bullet for you.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.730
I tried to kill myself.

09:18.434 --> 09:19.969
I couldn't bear to live
after you were

09:20.002 --> 09:22.271
taken away from me.

09:22.304 --> 09:24.673
But you didn't kill yourself.

09:24.707 --> 09:28.077
I couldn't, but I did.

09:29.812 --> 09:32.381
What have you done?

09:32.414 --> 09:35.151
You tried to sabotage me
from the beginning!

09:35.184 --> 09:37.153
Was that your plan?

09:37.186 --> 09:40.122
Talk to her,
see what her plan is!

09:40.156 --> 09:41.824
See if she can fix this!

09:41.857 --> 09:43.692
- I'm so sorry.
- You better fix this.

09:43.726 --> 09:47.396
You better fucking fix this
or I will kill you!

09:47.429 --> 09:50.132
So, he just killed himself?

09:50.166 --> 09:53.736
After the accident,
he had so much guilt.

09:53.769 --> 09:55.771
It was overwhelming for him.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.073
But you don't do that.

09:58.107 --> 09:59.441
What do you mean?

09:59.475 --> 10:00.976
That guilt was
so overwhelming for him.

10:01.010 --> 10:02.978
No, that's just
a useless excuse.

10:03.012 --> 10:05.447
But maybe that was just
his way of releasing it.

10:05.481 --> 10:08.083
He wasn't punishing himself.

10:08.117 --> 10:10.419
He was escaping it.

10:17.293 --> 10:19.995
I guess this is better now
than what I had.

10:20.029 --> 10:21.397
Don't say that, Lillian.

10:21.430 --> 10:24.233
No, maybe it's true.

10:24.266 --> 10:26.268
Such a terrible feeling
to sometimes hear

10:26.302 --> 10:27.870
the things around you.

10:29.538 --> 10:32.841
I felt like I was
drowning in myself.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.144
Such a torture
that no one knows.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.418
Living meant nothing.

10:42.451 --> 10:45.087
In a way I was set free
the day I found myself here.

10:49.558 --> 10:51.827
So, ask what you came to ask.

10:55.064 --> 10:56.832
Not yet.

12:25.421 --> 12:27.122
How could you do that?

12:31.927 --> 12:34.330
You lied.

12:36.599 --> 12:39.001
You really thought
you could do it, didn't you?

12:43.072 --> 12:45.374
Even when someone's life
is at stake,

12:45.407 --> 12:47.876
you just can't
leave it to chance

12:47.910 --> 12:50.145
just because you wanna
prove something to yourself.

12:56.352 --> 12:58.887
I thought I could save a life.

12:58.921 --> 13:00.356
How am I gonna fix this?

13:04.493 --> 13:06.462
What do you expect me to say?

13:08.564 --> 13:10.165
Nothing.

13:12.267 --> 13:14.637
I've always wanted
to be the one

13:14.671 --> 13:18.207
to give people
second chances in life.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.676
You had me convinced.

13:22.144 --> 13:24.146
Now I know
I'm just a normal bullet.

13:26.482 --> 13:28.050
Because what do bullets do?

13:30.587 --> 13:33.389
They kill.

13:33.422 --> 13:35.524
No one asked me
what I want out of this,

13:35.557 --> 13:37.526
to be the one
to kill or to save.

13:39.962 --> 13:41.598
When the moment comes
and that trigger's pulled,

13:41.631 --> 13:44.266
it's all decided by
who's behind the trigger.

13:47.637 --> 13:50.205
You may have wanted to be
someone's angel,

13:50.239 --> 13:53.976
just to save lives.

13:54.009 --> 13:55.612
But taking lives
is just as important.

13:58.313 --> 14:00.282
I never blame you,

14:00.315 --> 14:01.483
because...

14:24.072 --> 14:25.507
Please, Cal.

14:28.143 --> 14:29.478
No one forced you to do this.

14:29.511 --> 14:32.347
This is just me being a doctor.

14:32.381 --> 14:34.483
Have you considered
what she wants?

14:36.786 --> 14:38.987
What if she wants to stay dead?

14:39.021 --> 14:41.123
She's already
been through so much.

14:41.156 --> 14:43.559
Nothing,
I'm not gonna do anything.

14:43.593 --> 14:45.427
But I'm not gonna avoid
my responsibility

14:45.461 --> 14:47.429
and just let her lie here.

14:47.463 --> 14:51.533
And just so you know,

14:51.567 --> 14:54.102
it wasn't because of me.

14:57.306 --> 14:59.676
It wasn't because of me.

14:59.709 --> 15:01.778
She was killed
because of rumors.

15:01.811 --> 15:06.014
She was killed because she was
trying to find the right person.

15:06.048 --> 15:08.083
And don't expect her
to thank you

15:08.116 --> 15:10.285
for doing this or something.

15:10.319 --> 15:13.322
She will run far away

15:13.355 --> 15:16.291
in this tiny town

15:16.325 --> 15:18.560
as soon as she opens those eyes.

15:18.595 --> 15:21.430
That is exactly my wish for her.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.433
She trusted me with
those bullets that night.

15:24.466 --> 15:27.637
And just so you know,

15:27.670 --> 15:29.505
one day you're gonna
pull the trigger

15:29.538 --> 15:31.139
and find out that I'm gone.

15:31.173 --> 15:34.443
Ha, what,
when we don't need you anymore?

15:34.476 --> 15:36.545
Hopefully.

15:36.579 --> 15:39.114
By the way,

15:39.147 --> 15:41.618
how many bullets
do we have left?

16:07.242 --> 16:08.678
I'm ready.

16:47.717 --> 16:49.418
He's here.

17:05.835 --> 17:08.905
She'll wake up soon.

17:28.758 --> 17:31.628
Wow, look at you.

17:31.661 --> 17:34.631
I must be doing my job well.

17:34.664 --> 17:36.365
How you doing?

17:36.398 --> 17:38.500
Good, now that you're here.

17:38.533 --> 17:40.502
Have you head anything to eat?

17:40.535 --> 17:43.305
Cal, can I get you
another glass of wine,

17:43.338 --> 17:45.173
beer, soda, or something?

17:45.207 --> 17:46.643
Well, just water, please.

17:46.676 --> 17:47.677
Sure.

17:56.385 --> 17:57.587
Say when.

17:59.689 --> 18:01.523
Oh, thank you, that's good.

18:01.556 --> 18:03.191
My favorite.

18:09.699 --> 18:13.235
So, you've heard
of this scientist that

18:13.268 --> 18:15.805
uses water to try to prove
your thoughts can alter

18:15.838 --> 18:18.540
physical reality.

18:18.573 --> 18:19.909
Japanese one.

18:19.942 --> 18:21.778
Mm, you know him?

18:21.811 --> 18:23.613
Interesting guy, huh?

18:23.646 --> 18:25.347
Interesting.

18:25.380 --> 18:27.482
Kind of strange, you know.

18:27.516 --> 18:29.451
How's that?

18:29.484 --> 18:32.989
I mean, who studies water?

18:33.022 --> 18:37.259
I mean, until someone can
turn it into an art form,

18:37.292 --> 18:38.795
and now everyone
wants to know about it.

18:38.828 --> 18:41.396
Yeah, that's true, I guess.

18:46.769 --> 18:49.438
Cal, you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

18:49.471 --> 18:50.907
Sure.

18:53.308 --> 18:55.611
What is he trying to say?

18:59.882 --> 19:01.818
He's trying to
tell you something.

19:04.587 --> 19:07.456
Hey, you can...
you can talk to me, Barry.

19:07.489 --> 19:09.558
What... what's up?

19:15.732 --> 19:17.499
Better ask first.

19:19.401 --> 19:21.403
It's nothing.

19:21.436 --> 19:23.673
Hey.

19:23.706 --> 19:26.042
We've been through so much.

19:26.075 --> 19:28.243
We've come all this way.

19:30.046 --> 19:32.447
You can... you can talk to me.

19:34.349 --> 19:36.518
What's going on?

19:36.551 --> 19:39.021
Whatever it is,
I'm sure we can work it out.

19:39.055 --> 19:40.890
A man with a gun.

19:40.923 --> 19:43.425
Let me see your hands,
let's see your hands.

19:43.458 --> 19:45.393
After the old man
killed himself,

19:45.427 --> 19:47.663
they investigated his letter.

19:47.697 --> 19:49.397
Once they put
all the pieces together,

19:49.431 --> 19:50.733
they determined
it was suicide.

20:02.044 --> 20:03.545
Hey, can you hear me?

20:07.349 --> 20:08.851
Don't get me wrong.

20:08.885 --> 20:10.385
Listen, I'm just trying
to protect my wife

20:10.418 --> 20:12.789
from something bad
happening to her.

20:12.822 --> 20:14.489
That's why I wanted
to see you tonight.

20:18.895 --> 20:21.463
Cal,

20:21.496 --> 20:24.634
I'm such a coward.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.401
What?

20:26.434 --> 20:28.838
There's gonna come a time,

20:28.871 --> 20:31.874
and you're gonna know
when that time is,

20:31.908 --> 20:33.976
when I'm gonna want you
to deliver this for me.

20:36.712 --> 20:39.481
Timing's gotta be right.

20:39.514 --> 20:42.118
It's absolutely imperative.

20:42.151 --> 20:43.886
I can't afford
to mess this up.

20:59.669 --> 21:01.137
Pretty sure he's dead, but...

21:03.572 --> 21:05.741
What kind of letter?

21:05.775 --> 21:07.877
He made a farewell letter,

21:07.910 --> 21:10.079
and it was found
next to the body.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.076
Things would not be the same
for the family.

21:40.109 --> 21:43.913
The benefits that
they receive now would be gone.

21:43.946 --> 21:47.650
Becomes a difficult situation
when suicide's involved.

21:47.683 --> 21:50.920
When there's nobody left
to be held accountable,

21:50.953 --> 21:52.889
there is no excuse.

21:52.922 --> 21:55.858
Death is death.

21:55.892 --> 21:58.761
Well, if his death

21:58.794 --> 22:01.664
affects the life
of someone else,

22:01.697 --> 22:03.900
whatever helps.

22:03.933 --> 22:05.902
I thought they ruled that out,

22:05.935 --> 22:08.037
like you wrote here,

22:08.070 --> 22:09.705
but if that's the case...

22:12.642 --> 22:13.910
Well, then,

22:13.943 --> 22:15.912
I owe you one.

22:15.945 --> 22:18.180
I guess now I know
what I have to do.

22:45.708 --> 22:47.710
Sam, I can see your car.

22:53.683 --> 22:56.484
They called it
"the white bullet."

22:56.518 --> 22:58.486
Like white lies.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.589
But why would you
have to tell a lie?

23:00.623 --> 23:03.225
Everyone lies, Lillian.

23:03.259 --> 23:05.560
We had to tell tell lies
to protect ourselves

23:05.594 --> 23:07.229
from people.

23:11.734 --> 23:13.869
Not everyone could get
their hands on these bullets.

23:15.938 --> 23:18.140
How so?

23:18.174 --> 23:19.909
Well, it's not like you could
just go to the store

23:19.942 --> 23:21.877
and get one of these.

24:03.953 --> 24:06.689
It's me.

24:06.722 --> 24:08.324
- I need to tell you something.
- No, no.

24:08.357 --> 24:10.159
- I need to...
- This is not right.

24:23.139 --> 24:24.807
You kidding me,
are you kidding me?

24:24.840 --> 24:26.842
Is this some kind of joke?

24:26.876 --> 24:29.045
- I watched you die.
- What?

24:31.347 --> 24:33.015
What are you a fucking ghost?

24:33.049 --> 24:34.717
What are you doing back here?

24:34.750 --> 24:35.885
I don't believe
in superstitions,

24:35.918 --> 24:37.720
you son of a bitch.

24:37.753 --> 24:39.722
- You did one time.
- Yeah.

24:39.755 --> 24:41.023
Took away
the most important thing

24:41.057 --> 24:43.793
I loved in this world.

24:43.826 --> 24:45.061
Sam, you've gotta listen to me.

24:45.094 --> 24:47.997
Shut up, shut up.

24:48.030 --> 24:50.332
I should've never gotten
involved with those bullets

24:50.366 --> 24:52.701
to begin with.

24:55.271 --> 24:58.674
You used them,
you had the bullets.

24:58.707 --> 25:00.242
You used them on yourself.

25:00.276 --> 25:02.144
- No, no, I didn't, no.
- That's what you did.

25:02.178 --> 25:04.313
- I didn't.
- You found a way to use them

25:04.346 --> 25:06.182
- on yourself.
- Sam, I didn't, no.

25:06.215 --> 25:07.716
Why did you come here?

25:07.750 --> 25:09.285
Why did you come to see me?

25:09.318 --> 25:11.020
You're either stupid or brave.

25:11.053 --> 25:13.656
- You figure it out.
- Sam,

25:13.689 --> 25:15.724
- I think I found it.
- Yeah, why should I believe

25:15.758 --> 25:17.626
- anything that you say?
- Well, it came to me.

25:17.660 --> 25:20.863
I don't believe
anything you say.

25:20.896 --> 25:23.199
Look at me.

25:23.232 --> 25:25.634
I'm back.

25:27.970 --> 25:29.238
I'm right here.

25:29.271 --> 25:31.974
I'm back.

25:32.007 --> 25:33.275
From the dead.

25:37.746 --> 25:40.382
Back from the dead.

25:40.416 --> 25:43.986
I just thought it was
the old man all along.

25:44.019 --> 25:46.155
They used it on me.

25:46.188 --> 25:47.790
"They used it on me," he said.

25:51.427 --> 25:52.995
And you know me, Lillian.

25:53.028 --> 25:55.397
You know that I never
would've done anything

25:55.431 --> 25:57.166
unless I saw this for myself,

25:57.199 --> 25:59.401
unless I was convinced.

25:59.435 --> 26:01.670
I mean,

26:01.704 --> 26:05.141
I still remember his hands,

26:05.174 --> 26:07.209
his eyes,

26:07.243 --> 26:10.880
his reddish gray hair.

26:10.913 --> 26:12.248
He was right in front of me.

26:14.450 --> 26:16.218
And he said to me...

26:16.252 --> 26:18.921
It was one of the doctors
in the morgue.

26:18.954 --> 26:20.956
One of the doctors?

26:20.990 --> 26:24.260
Then he's the one
who had the white bullets.

26:24.293 --> 26:25.728
Who has the white bullets.

26:28.030 --> 26:29.832
Where and how?

26:29.865 --> 26:31.967
Where did they use it on you?
How... how did they decide

26:32.001 --> 26:34.270
- to use it on you?
- I don't know,

26:34.303 --> 26:36.238
I just woke up.

26:36.272 --> 26:39.808
Woke up? Hm.

26:39.842 --> 26:42.278
11, 11 and a half?

26:42.311 --> 26:45.147
Thanks.

26:45.181 --> 26:47.183
I mean, he finds validation

26:47.216 --> 26:50.219
in people that he helps.

26:50.252 --> 26:53.255
He's got his own set
of moral codes.

26:55.457 --> 26:58.093
What about my daughter?

26:58.127 --> 26:59.929
I mean, you're acting
like you know the guy.

26:59.962 --> 27:01.830
Did you even see his face?

27:01.864 --> 27:05.201
Sam, I told you,
I didn't see his face.

27:05.234 --> 27:08.804
I... look, I'm just grateful
for what he did.

27:08.837 --> 27:12.074
I don't speak for them,
but you're acting like

27:12.107 --> 27:14.143
you came here,
and, I mean,

27:14.176 --> 27:16.779
I'm surprised you just
came here to see me,

27:16.812 --> 27:18.347
that you would come
to see me first.

27:18.380 --> 27:20.349
But still, I...

27:22.184 --> 27:24.320
- But still...
- This is it.

27:24.353 --> 27:26.488
- She's gonna want to meet him.
- They must've found out.

27:28.357 --> 27:32.428
I mean, why would they help
a miserable old man like me?

27:35.097 --> 27:36.899
Well, when it comes
to the story,

27:36.932 --> 27:39.768
we only know
part of the whole.

27:41.337 --> 27:42.905
The thing is, so do they.

27:42.938 --> 27:44.406
I told you.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.908
Let's leave.

27:48.077 --> 27:50.412
Wait a minute.

27:50.446 --> 27:53.349
You wanna meet him?

27:53.382 --> 27:55.117
The man who saved my life?

27:55.150 --> 27:56.819
We've done our job.

27:56.852 --> 27:58.387
She's just gonna do
what she wants to.

27:58.420 --> 28:01.190
You don't even know who he is
or where to find him.

28:04.059 --> 28:05.427
I'm not going.

28:05.461 --> 28:07.396
We are, let's go.

28:10.966 --> 28:12.968
To be honest with you, though,

28:13.002 --> 28:16.138
I had to trust my instincts
at that point.

28:16.171 --> 28:18.440
I couldn't let my curiosity
cloud my view.

28:20.876 --> 28:22.378
Your curiosity?

28:22.411 --> 28:24.546
Lilly, I had to have
a clear conscience

28:24.581 --> 28:27.850
before I came to you
and asked for your forgiveness.

28:30.085 --> 28:31.954
- So, I followed him.
- Sam.

28:35.224 --> 28:39.295
Again, I'm sorry
for what happened.

28:39.328 --> 28:41.163
You say that
after you fix this.

29:22.037 --> 29:23.439
The doctor.

29:25.040 --> 29:28.010
See, the doctor was
the key to all of this.

29:28.911 --> 29:31.880
You know,
sometimes the truth sucks,

29:31.914 --> 29:33.882
and it hurts.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.289
We tell ourselves
what we want to believe,

29:42.057 --> 29:44.627
I became wary of everything.

29:44.661 --> 29:46.663
I started studying the details.

29:56.305 --> 29:59.308
Which just made me
more skeptical.

30:57.634 --> 31:00.269
Hello?

31:00.302 --> 31:02.304
I could never forgive myself

31:02.337 --> 31:04.373
for what had happened to you.

31:07.075 --> 31:10.179
I mean,
if there had been a way...

31:10.212 --> 31:12.481
So, did you find
what you were looking for?

31:14.751 --> 31:16.084
Hello?

31:19.021 --> 31:20.389
Hello?

31:27.029 --> 31:29.097
Anyone home?

34:26.643 --> 34:28.777
All right.

34:28.811 --> 34:30.580
All right, yeah, I just...
I gotta get something to drink.

34:30.612 --> 34:33.315
It's really hot out, okay.

34:33.348 --> 34:35.217
All right, take care.

34:39.822 --> 34:41.724
I ran.

35:08.017 --> 35:09.384
But I had to meet him.

35:35.578 --> 35:36.646
Hey!

35:36.679 --> 35:37.780
Hey, you!

35:40.415 --> 35:41.450
I didn't want to run away

35:41.483 --> 35:43.753
from the only chance
I might have.

35:47.857 --> 35:49.859
I needed to get back in there.

36:50.019 --> 36:52.521
Excuse me, sir,
is this your house?

36:52.554 --> 36:53.756
Yeah.

36:55.524 --> 36:57.827
Are you Cal Owens?

37:03.032 --> 37:04.332
Thank you.

37:06.736 --> 37:08.805
I think I know why you're here,

37:08.838 --> 37:11.974
It must've been
pretty damn urgent, huh?

37:12.008 --> 37:14.442
Mind telling me more?

37:14.476 --> 37:16.779
It is.

37:16.813 --> 37:18.614
It should have been fixed
earlier.

37:20.950 --> 37:23.485
I'm running out of time.

37:23.518 --> 37:25.621
I need to be direct
with you, sir.

37:25.655 --> 37:27.556
I need your help.

37:27.590 --> 37:30.559
Okay, keep going.

37:30.593 --> 37:33.095
The bullet that
I've heard stories about,

37:33.129 --> 37:37.633
I'm coming to find out
that it's true.

37:37.667 --> 37:41.704
And I know that you have it.

37:41.737 --> 37:44.040
And I need you to help
my daughter.

37:44.073 --> 37:45.540
Daughter?

37:45.574 --> 37:47.542
So this is about
your daughter?

37:47.576 --> 37:49.745
You know what,
do you mind sharing with me

37:49.779 --> 37:51.614
what your name is?

37:51.647 --> 37:53.015
Samantha Grey.

37:53.049 --> 37:56.018
Okay, Ms. Grey,
what is it that you do?

37:56.052 --> 37:57.385
I train dogs.

37:57.419 --> 38:00.056
Dogs, what kind of dogs?

38:00.089 --> 38:02.959
For what purpose?

38:02.992 --> 38:04.927
For the blind,

38:04.961 --> 38:08.530
for anyone
that needs assistance.

38:08.563 --> 38:10.700
And what is it
that you like about it?

38:10.733 --> 38:12.134
What do mean, what...

38:12.168 --> 38:14.170
Look, I don't mean
to offend you.

38:14.203 --> 38:17.405
Consider this my way of trying
to get to know you better.

38:17.439 --> 38:19.609
This seems irrelevant.

38:19.642 --> 38:21.509
If you want to get to know me...

38:21.543 --> 38:23.145
I do want to know you.

38:23.179 --> 38:27.750
That's why I'm here,
asking you these questions.

38:27.783 --> 38:29.685
So, let me ask you,

38:29.719 --> 38:31.053
when you're training your dogs,

38:31.087 --> 38:32.855
what is it about the dog

38:32.889 --> 38:35.825
that makes you want
to send it back to its owner?

38:38.227 --> 38:39.929
I'm sorry.

38:39.962 --> 38:42.732
But my work is
of no interest to you,

38:42.765 --> 38:45.635
I don't see what this
has to do with anything.

38:45.668 --> 38:47.737
If you say so,

38:47.770 --> 38:50.206
then I guess so.

38:53.541 --> 38:56.979
But I'm afraid to tell you,

38:57.013 --> 38:58.147
I'm sorry.

38:58.180 --> 39:01.217
It came to us,

39:01.250 --> 39:03.853
either as a blessing
or a curse.

39:06.488 --> 39:08.523
Please don't say no to me.

39:10.660 --> 39:11.961
I need this.

39:13.229 --> 39:15.164
I need this.

39:15.197 --> 39:17.465
- Please don't say no to me.
- Please stop.

39:17.499 --> 39:20.236
- Please!
- Stop.

39:20.269 --> 39:23.072
- I can't.
- I will do anything.

39:23.105 --> 39:25.107
I will do anything!

39:25.141 --> 39:28.476
Please give it to me, please.

39:28.510 --> 39:30.680
Ms. Grey.

39:30.713 --> 39:32.815
Please.

39:32.848 --> 39:35.651
I've only got one bullet left.

39:39.255 --> 39:42.058
I know as a doctor
it's my job to help people,

39:42.091 --> 39:44.827
to help people
who are suffering.

39:44.860 --> 39:47.997
But you and I both know
there's plenty of people...

39:48.030 --> 39:50.733
Why can't you
just use it on me?

39:50.766 --> 39:53.069
Why can't you
just give it to me?

39:53.102 --> 39:55.537
I need it.

39:55.570 --> 39:58.107
I need it for my girl,

39:58.140 --> 40:01.476
for my daughter, please.

40:04.146 --> 40:05.513
Please.

40:05.547 --> 40:08.617
You're not sure I deserved it?

40:08.651 --> 40:10.920
Is that why you were asking me
all those questions,

40:10.953 --> 40:13.656
see if I really deserved it?

40:13.689 --> 40:18.160
Who gave you the right
to fucking play God?

40:18.194 --> 40:19.929
I'm sorry.

40:19.962 --> 40:22.965
I'm sorry, Doctor,
I'm sorry, sir.

40:22.999 --> 40:25.801
You... you asked me
about my dogs.

40:26.969 --> 40:28.536
You know how I pick them?

40:28.570 --> 40:31.741
We pick the dogs,
we train them,

40:31.774 --> 40:34.110
we... we put them
through a series of tests.

40:34.143 --> 40:36.679
It's all about sacrifice
for them.

40:36.712 --> 40:39.115
They don't get to choose
what their assignment is,

40:39.148 --> 40:41.617
and yet they learn to love
unconditionally.

40:41.650 --> 40:45.588
I would've sacrificed
everything for my daughter.

40:45.621 --> 40:47.590
Everything.

40:47.623 --> 40:51.260
And I am here today

40:51.293 --> 40:53.629
to sacrifice everything,

40:53.662 --> 40:55.698
so go ahead and judge me.

40:58.701 --> 41:00.169
Go ahead.

41:10.846 --> 41:12.248
Go ahead.

41:21.323 --> 41:22.557
Let's go see her.

41:34.303 --> 41:36.238
She's okay.

41:58.127 --> 41:59.829
I couldn't help it.

41:59.862 --> 42:03.165
Something was...

42:03.199 --> 42:05.868
eating at me.

42:05.901 --> 42:07.803
I needed to get back in there.

42:09.839 --> 42:12.708
He's a doctor,
so luckily I knew

42:12.741 --> 42:14.877
he wouldn't be home
during the day.

42:16.278 --> 42:18.414
As I'd hoped,

42:18.447 --> 42:20.015
no one answered.

42:21.784 --> 42:24.386
I don't know why
I grabbed the door,

42:24.420 --> 42:27.790
I'm not a thief or a criminal.

42:30.459 --> 42:32.128
The door was unlocked again.

42:37.266 --> 42:40.769
At first I was relieved,

42:40.803 --> 42:43.105
so I thought no one was there.

43:17.873 --> 43:19.942
How is she?

43:19.975 --> 43:21.143
Is she okay?

43:23.145 --> 43:25.414
She's okay.

43:25.447 --> 43:29.151
I did exactly like you asked,
gave her my full attention.

43:29.185 --> 43:30.352
Can I see her?

43:31.453 --> 43:34.089
Yes.

43:34.123 --> 43:36.759
But if we're gonna
do this, Barry,

43:36.792 --> 43:39.161
you should trust me.

43:39.195 --> 43:41.497
It's better to wait.

43:41.530 --> 43:43.866
How are things going
on your end?

43:55.778 --> 43:57.513
Thanks for everything, Cal.

43:57.546 --> 44:00.749
Everything went just fine.

44:00.783 --> 44:03.452
At least I think so.

44:03.485 --> 44:05.254
How about you?

44:05.287 --> 44:07.089
Come to any resolution?

44:09.124 --> 44:12.494
Yeah, that's what
we need to decide.

44:14.129 --> 44:15.898
I went to her house.

45:18.093 --> 45:20.262
You should've let it go.

45:20.296 --> 45:22.398
Don't you think she's going
to go there again?

45:22.431 --> 45:23.899
Yeah, I wouldn't worry
about that,

45:23.932 --> 45:25.267
she's too afraid
to do something there.

45:37.112 --> 45:38.314
There was nothing.

45:40.482 --> 45:42.217
The book was gone.

45:42.251 --> 45:44.086
And where was the book?

45:44.119 --> 45:47.022
Sounds to me you're unsure
about giving people chances.

45:48.390 --> 45:49.626
No.

45:49.659 --> 45:51.460
No, it's not that.

45:52.928 --> 45:54.296
You just want people
to be unhappy.

45:54.330 --> 45:56.599
No, I just think that

45:56.633 --> 45:59.568
even the hardest things
to accept...

46:03.205 --> 46:05.140
...they're meant to be, too.

46:05.174 --> 46:06.575
I was being led.

46:07.677 --> 46:10.412
For every step I took,

46:10.446 --> 46:13.349
I realized I was always
a few steps behind.

46:21.323 --> 46:24.193
Why do you exist?

46:24.226 --> 46:26.028
I don't know.

46:26.061 --> 46:28.530
It wasn't up to me
to be the one.

46:35.938 --> 46:39.074
Maybe I'm just here
because people like you need me.

46:44.113 --> 46:46.048
Are you sure you want
to do this?

46:51.019 --> 46:52.287
Yes.

46:54.490 --> 46:55.924
Yes.

46:57.993 --> 46:59.596
Yes.

47:14.510 --> 47:18.280
I was visited
by some unwanted company.

47:25.521 --> 47:27.256
Who, the old man?

47:27.289 --> 47:29.726
Yes, he was there.

47:29.759 --> 47:31.193
By himself?

47:33.362 --> 47:35.264
With the doctor.

48:20.409 --> 48:21.611
What?

48:23.378 --> 48:24.614
What is this?

48:38.227 --> 48:39.294
No dog?

48:40.496 --> 48:42.331
Placed in a home.

48:44.634 --> 48:46.803
Ms. Grey, come.

48:48.838 --> 48:50.172
Have a seat.

48:50.205 --> 48:51.507
Let's have a chat.

49:03.552 --> 49:05.254
Please stop.

49:07.155 --> 49:08.625
She's been through enough
already.

49:11.493 --> 49:12.595
How many times?

49:15.665 --> 49:17.232
Hey, what is this?

49:20.202 --> 49:22.137
- Found this inside the drawer.
- So what?

49:22.170 --> 49:23.305
What does that mean?

49:24.807 --> 49:30.178
You know you, asked me
to judge you, Ms. Grey.

49:30.212 --> 49:33.081
Maybe this is the result
of all the negativity

49:33.115 --> 49:34.449
that you've stirred up.

49:38.588 --> 49:40.255
Did it make you feel better

49:40.289 --> 49:42.859
reading this
while you were so angry?

49:53.468 --> 49:55.237
You know it's hard
to forgive someone

49:55.270 --> 49:57.807
when you're held up
with so much contempt.

49:57.840 --> 50:00.542
You're all stirred up
with your emotions aren't you?

50:02.645 --> 50:05.648
Did you say something
over there?

50:05.682 --> 50:08.417
He has nothing to do with this.

50:08.450 --> 50:10.853
He's paid his dues.

50:18.260 --> 50:20.562
What is that?

50:20.597 --> 50:21.764
This isn't gonna work.

50:23.866 --> 50:26.268
Don't you think she's been
through enough already?

50:27.336 --> 50:29.672
What do you mean?

50:29.706 --> 50:31.908
What are you doing?

50:31.941 --> 50:34.576
Don't you think this woman
has been through enough?

50:34.611 --> 50:36.511
She's been through enough
already.

50:36.545 --> 50:38.213
After all this time,

50:38.246 --> 50:39.448
you decide to get involved now?

50:39.481 --> 50:41.516
She's already lost everything,
she's lost her daughter.

50:41.550 --> 50:43.686
Don't you think that's enough?

50:43.720 --> 50:46.188
This is not our place.

50:46.221 --> 50:48.223
What do you think she's done?

50:48.256 --> 50:50.860
Oh, you mean besides
committing a crime?

50:50.893 --> 50:53.295
That's not what I meant.

50:53.328 --> 50:56.633
Listen, we are not one of them.

50:56.666 --> 50:59.167
Let's not try
to protect her, okay?

51:02.437 --> 51:03.640
I'll kill you!

51:06.843 --> 51:07.844
This is...

51:07.877 --> 51:08.945
It was a letter.

51:08.978 --> 51:10.212
I know that.

51:10.245 --> 51:12.849
Why don't you want
to help them?

51:12.882 --> 51:15.417
I'm very sorry for the choices
that I've made.

51:18.588 --> 51:20.757
This is not our place.

51:23.291 --> 51:25.762
And don't present yourself
as an equal.

51:27.764 --> 51:29.866
I know who you are.

51:42.912 --> 51:44.246
Who am I?

51:50.753 --> 51:54.489
You would think
they're equal, wouldn't you?

51:54.523 --> 51:56.258
But tell me this:

51:56.291 --> 51:59.595
Why do they need
to hurt each other?

51:59.629 --> 52:02.531
You didn't know, did you?

52:02.564 --> 52:05.300
It wasn't just one letter
that he made out.

52:05.333 --> 52:08.370
He wanted me to protect
and provide closure

52:08.403 --> 52:11.708
for his wife
after his untimely death.

52:11.741 --> 52:14.242
Dead men don't tell tales.

52:16.679 --> 52:18.848
Because they have me.

52:18.881 --> 52:20.683
I was being condemned.

52:20.717 --> 52:22.585
And what makes you so special?

52:23.953 --> 52:25.487
Like I did something wrong.

52:25.520 --> 52:27.657
I'm sorry, Anessa.

52:31.027 --> 52:33.562
You may think
we are similar in every way.

52:35.530 --> 52:38.467
But you couldn't be
further from the truth.

52:43.405 --> 52:46.008
This little fact

52:46.042 --> 52:48.010
makes me of greater value
than you.

52:50.747 --> 52:54.282
I had to know exactly
what I was dealing with.

52:58.553 --> 52:59.622
It was the truth.

53:02.592 --> 53:04.994
He didn't kill himself.

53:05.027 --> 53:06.896
I bring people back.

53:09.364 --> 53:10.833
You only kill them.

53:19.008 --> 53:20.375
You killed him.

53:23.813 --> 53:25.014
You're practically...

53:27.415 --> 53:28.550
a murderer.

53:42.497 --> 53:44.700
He's a murderer.

53:44.734 --> 53:47.603
He killed my daughter.

53:47.637 --> 53:51.373
There are two sides
to every story, Ms. Grey.

53:51.406 --> 53:54.877
I suggest you start
telling yours now.

53:54.911 --> 53:56.579
What did you do?

53:58.815 --> 54:00.082
Please!

54:01.951 --> 54:03.853
Mom!

54:03.886 --> 54:05.621
Please just answer me!

54:05.655 --> 54:08.024
Did you kill him?

54:08.057 --> 54:11.761
Please answer me,
how could you do this?

54:15.564 --> 54:17.867
Why would you do this?

54:26.642 --> 54:28.077
Please just answer me, Mom,

54:28.110 --> 54:30.512
what did you do?

54:30.545 --> 54:32.648
If I tell you,
will you help me?

54:37.552 --> 54:38.821
Fine.

54:45.094 --> 54:46.461
We'll burn the letter.

54:48.164 --> 54:50.099
Please answer me.

54:52.168 --> 54:54.402
What did you do?

54:56.806 --> 54:58.506
I did it.

55:03.179 --> 55:05.181
I killed him.

55:06.716 --> 55:09.185
No.

55:09.218 --> 55:11.087
No, I didn't kill him.

55:15.457 --> 55:16.424
No.

55:29.105 --> 55:30.505
Shoot me.

55:34.476 --> 55:36.544
Sam, what do you mean,
shoot you?

55:36.579 --> 55:37.713
Oh, my God.

55:47.056 --> 55:50.059
I don't suppose you'd begrudge
Mr. Syput for all this.

55:51.994 --> 55:54.163
After all, he came to me
the other night,

55:54.196 --> 55:55.998
and after all the time
I've known him,

55:56.032 --> 55:57.532
I've never seen him be put off

55:57.565 --> 56:00.236
as much as he was that night.

56:00.269 --> 56:03.105
He didn't tell me anything
about you two,

56:03.139 --> 56:06.776
and I would have never
figured it out.

56:06.809 --> 56:09.211
Except when he came to me
the other night,

56:09.245 --> 56:11.747
he told me that he wanted
to take his own life,

56:11.781 --> 56:14.050
that he didn't want
to go on living anymore,

56:14.083 --> 56:18.587
and I thought that was quite odd
for a man of his age.

56:18.621 --> 56:21.657
And more so,
why would he abandon his wife

56:21.691 --> 56:23.159
and leave her behind
with no benefits

56:23.192 --> 56:24.694
after he passed?

56:27.964 --> 56:30.933
Ms. Grey,
he was looking for help.

56:34.003 --> 56:35.771
And I was there
to help this man.

56:49.251 --> 56:52.088
Please shoot me.

56:52.121 --> 56:55.658
I'm offering my life to you.

56:55.691 --> 56:57.059
I just want it over.

56:57.093 --> 56:59.095
I want to die.

57:02.064 --> 57:05.034
Why? I don't understand.

57:07.336 --> 57:11.674
Oh, you don't understand
what I've done for it.

57:13.342 --> 57:15.011
For what?

57:16.012 --> 57:16.979
The bullet.

57:32.928 --> 57:35.598
You may have wanted
to be someone's angel,

57:35.631 --> 57:39.068
just to save lives,

57:39.101 --> 57:41.037
but taking lives
is just as important.

57:43.639 --> 57:45.341
I never blamed you,

57:45.374 --> 57:48.210
because I had my doubts.

57:50.112 --> 57:51.947
Dash, on the other hand,

57:51.981 --> 57:53.315
he didn't think
it would be wise

57:53.349 --> 57:54.850
to use the bullet on someone

57:54.884 --> 57:57.353
who's claiming to kill himself.

57:57.386 --> 57:59.922
No!

57:59.955 --> 58:01.891
Nooo!

58:01.924 --> 58:04.593
Please don't do this!

58:05.961 --> 58:07.763
But I knew otherwise.

58:10.866 --> 58:12.968
This man was innocent.

58:18.808 --> 58:21.744
And I decided
to use everything on him.

59:02.852 --> 59:05.054
I'm sorry to say, Ms. Grey.

59:08.057 --> 59:10.126
I don't have
what you're looking for.

59:13.963 --> 59:15.331
The last bullet...

59:16.899 --> 59:17.867
...the last one...

59:20.236 --> 59:21.403
was used on him.

59:27.276 --> 59:28.777
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Yes?

59:28.811 --> 59:30.112
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Owens.

59:30.146 --> 59:31.914
This is my house.

59:44.994 --> 59:47.429
Jesus, I don't even know
want to say.

59:50.032 --> 59:52.134
I watched her suffer.

59:54.303 --> 59:55.704
I didn't even help her.

59:58.107 --> 59:59.875
I watched her seize, and...

01:00:18.194 --> 01:00:19.995
What did you do?

01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:21.096
The woman.

01:00:22.798 --> 01:00:23.799
What woman?

01:00:23.832 --> 01:00:25.134
Who, where?

01:00:26.535 --> 01:00:27.937
At the doctor's.

01:00:30.039 --> 01:00:31.774
I went to get the bullet.

01:00:33.909 --> 01:00:36.412
- I knew my way around.
- Who was it?

01:00:38.514 --> 01:00:39.848
She was blind.

01:00:41.517 --> 01:00:42.484
She was old.

01:00:45.321 --> 01:00:47.790
What did you do?

01:00:47.823 --> 01:00:49.458
I'm not a criminal.

01:00:51.193 --> 01:00:53.462
I just went in there
to get the bullet.

01:00:56.332 --> 01:00:58.334
I just had to get the bullet.

01:01:03.272 --> 01:01:04.473
My Lillian...

01:01:06.141 --> 01:01:08.911
My Lillian's so mad at me.

01:01:10.479 --> 01:01:12.014
More than that old woman.

01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:13.115
Sir?

01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:17.453
Sir.

01:01:17.486 --> 01:01:19.021
What is this?

01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:21.090
- Are you Dr. Owens?
- Yes.

01:01:21.123 --> 01:01:22.558
Do you know her?

01:01:22.592 --> 01:01:24.893
She called us.

01:01:24.927 --> 01:01:27.029
She said she needs
to talk to you.

01:01:36.038 --> 01:01:38.107
I had to see if it would work.

01:01:40.042 --> 01:01:42.177
I had to know
if I could trust her.

01:01:43.613 --> 01:01:44.980
Mr. Syput?

01:01:46.282 --> 01:01:47.983
Mr. Syput?

01:02:10.172 --> 01:02:11.907
So you can save my wife.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.909
Why can't you just
do this for me?

01:02:16.445 --> 01:02:18.080
Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:18.113 --> 01:02:20.482
Mr. Syput?

01:02:20.516 --> 01:02:21.950
You can't let her do this!

01:02:21.984 --> 01:02:24.086
- The old lady...
- Don't you understand?

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:25.988
...you saw her?

01:02:26.021 --> 01:02:27.990
Stop her!

01:02:28.023 --> 01:02:30.259
Don't let her do this!

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.868
Talk to me, look at me.

01:02:39.902 --> 01:02:40.969
Look at me.

01:02:42.404 --> 01:02:44.139
- Talk to me.
- Stop her.

01:02:44.173 --> 01:02:45.274
- Answer me.
- Don't let her do this!

01:02:45.307 --> 01:02:48.277
You saw the old woman,
the blind woman?

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:50.245
Who was she?

01:02:50.279 --> 01:02:53.315
- Who was she?
- Don't you understand?

01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:55.551
- Don't let her do this!
- Tell me!

01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:00.956
This gun took away everything
important to me in my life.

01:03:00.989 --> 01:03:04.059
There is nothing left
for me here.

01:03:04.093 --> 01:03:06.328
I shot you once in revenge.

01:03:08.097 --> 01:03:12.267
- You owe this to me.
- You don't have to do this!

01:03:12.301 --> 01:03:14.303
There's another world out there.

01:03:17.339 --> 01:03:20.008
Please don't,
you're gonna regret this.

01:03:20.042 --> 01:03:22.244
There's a whole world out there.

01:03:22.277 --> 01:03:24.279
She's talking to me.

01:03:26.548 --> 01:03:29.518
I can hear her.

01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:32.121
Please, you don't have
to do this.

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:35.290
You don't have to do this.

01:03:35.324 --> 01:03:37.126
There's a whole world out there.

01:03:37.159 --> 01:03:39.194
This has nothing
to do with you.

01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:03.218
Don't, please stop.

01:04:03.252 --> 01:04:05.421
Sam, Sam, listen.

01:04:05.454 --> 01:04:07.022
Sam, Sam, look at me.

01:04:07.055 --> 01:04:08.056
Sam.

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:09.458
Sam, look at me!

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.295
Don't do this, Sam.

01:04:13.328 --> 01:04:14.329
Please don't do this.

01:04:14.363 --> 01:04:16.331
Sam, Sam, please, look at me!

01:04:19.168 --> 01:04:22.171
Keep watching people die
at my expense.

01:04:41.356 --> 01:04:44.526
I've been waiting so long
to ask you this.

01:04:47.095 --> 01:04:49.264
Will you forgive me?

01:05:03.045 --> 01:05:05.782
Death comes whenever it wants.

01:05:05.815 --> 01:05:09.719
I will decide where and when
I lay my head to rest.

01:05:09.752 --> 01:05:12.655
I won't let you rest
until you tell me what you saw!

01:05:17.827 --> 01:05:19.361
The trigger is with me.

01:05:21.263 --> 01:05:25.100
The woman, you saw her.

01:05:25.133 --> 01:05:27.637
You saw her dying?

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:29.304
- Tell me!
- I don't want it anymore.

01:05:29.338 --> 01:05:31.240
Tell me.

01:05:31.273 --> 01:05:32.441
- Who was she?
- I don't know...

01:05:32.474 --> 01:05:33.442
You know who she was.

01:05:33.475 --> 01:05:34.744
Tell me, I gotta know!

01:05:34.777 --> 01:05:36.411
You gotta tell me!

01:05:42.217 --> 01:05:45.153
Please, tell me you didn't.

01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:49.792
Please.

01:05:52.795 --> 01:05:56.198
Everything is gonna
be fine, Barry.

01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:57.634
Everything is gonna be fine.

01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:01.270
Sam.

01:06:01.303 --> 01:06:02.304
Sam, listen.

01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:03.472
Listen to me.

01:06:03.505 --> 01:06:06.141
Sam.

01:06:06.174 --> 01:06:07.276
Sam, listen to me.

01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:08.544
Look at me, Sam.

01:06:08.577 --> 01:06:10.546
Sam, look at me!

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.814
Sammy, don't do this.

01:06:11.848 --> 01:06:13.716
Please, Sam, don't do this.

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:15.384
Sam, please!

01:06:15.417 --> 01:06:17.119
Sam, look at me, don't do this!

01:06:17.152 --> 01:06:19.221
Please, Sam, don't do this!

01:06:19.254 --> 01:06:21.557
Sam, please,
don't do this, please!

01:06:21.591 --> 01:06:22.625
Nooo!

01:07:19.424 --> 01:07:24.424
