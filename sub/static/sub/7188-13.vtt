19:55.127 --> 19:56.361
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT!

19:56.361 --> 20:00.766
THEN I GUESS YOU WON'T MIND
IF I DO THIS.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.034
[BEEP, DIALING]

20:02.034 --> 20:04.803

20:18.083 --> 20:20.219
SHE'S BEEN WATCHING

20:20.219 --> 20:22.921
Dad: NOW, YOU KNOW HOW
I HATE THAT CREEPY PUPPET.

20:22.921 --> 20:24.423
YOU GET HOME RIGHT AWAY.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.358
THAT IS A BUNCH
OF BRAINWASHING.

20:26.358 --> 20:30.729
SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE IN
PRETTY BIG TROUBLE.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.397
I CAN'T GET
IN TROUBLE.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.932
IT'S AGAINST
MY NATURE!

20:33.932 --> 20:35.334
THIS IS...

20:35.334 --> 20:37.502
THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT!

20:37.502 --> 20:39.471

20:45.077 --> 20:48.847
CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GAVE UP ALL
THE FREE GOODIES.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.349
ALL POSSESSIONS
ARE FLEETING,

20:50.349 --> 20:55.921
DANG! I WAS JUST
GONNA SAY SOMETIMES
LIFE'S A PUNK LIKE THAT,

20:55.921 --> 20:58.423
BUT YOURS WAS
WAY MORE POETIC.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.926
HEY, HEY!

ABOUT, SHORT STUFF?

21:05.330 --> 21:06.098
OH, YEAH.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.499
THAT'S THE CUSTOM FIT.

21:07.499 --> 21:09.368
OH, NO.
PUMP THEM BRAKES.

21:09.368 --> 21:10.936
YOU ARE NOT
MY KAMIKAI MAN.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.504
YOU'RE LIKE
6 YEARS YOUNGER

21:12.504 --> 21:13.805
AND UMPTEEN INCHES
SHORTER.

21:13.805 --> 21:15.374
HEH HEH HEH.
YEAH, YOU'D BE AMAZED

21:15.374 --> 21:18.010
WHAT PLATFORM BOOTS
AND FOAM MUSCLES CAN DO.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.044
YOU WANNA GO DANCE AGAIN?

21:19.044 --> 21:21.146
OR WE COULD JUST KISS
OR SOMETHING.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.448
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A KYLE WILKINS

21:23.448 --> 21:25.117

AND EXCITEMENT.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.985

MY BIG BROTHER KYLE?

21:26.985 --> 21:30.255
I'LL HAVE TO TELL HIM

21:30.255 --> 21:33.025
UH, WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?

21:33.025 --> 21:36.161
OH, NO!

21:36.161 --> 21:37.929
SORRY I WENT HOSTILE
ON YOU.

21:37.929 --> 21:40.565
IF I HADN'T TEASED
YOU INTO BREAKING
THE RULES,

21:40.565 --> 21:42.434
YOU NEVER WOULD
HAVE GOTTEN HOOKED
ON THAT SHOW

21:42.434 --> 21:43.869
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.504
I GUESS MAYBE BEING
A GOODY TWO-SHOES

21:45.504 --> 21:47.406
ISN'T SUCH
A BAD THING.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.875
IT WAS KIND OF FUN
HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.476
GOOD. 'CAUSE I GOT
A FEELING

21:51.476 --> 21:53.412
WE'RE GONNA BE
SPENDING A WHOLE LOT

21:53.412 --> 21:55.414
OF TIME AT HOME
TOGETHER.

21:55.414 --> 22:01.219
Dad: THAT IS RIGHT.
YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE
MY HOUSE AGAIN.

22:01.219 --> 22:05.324
YOU ARE STAYING HERE
IF I HAVE TO BOLT YOU
TO THE FLOOR.
