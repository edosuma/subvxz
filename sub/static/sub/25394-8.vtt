WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:04.265
Previously onSalvation...My fellow Americans,

00:04.308 --> 00:06.963
the unthinkable...

00:07.007 --> 00:08.182
...has become reality.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.574
ALYCIA:
Darius Tanz

00:09.618 --> 00:10.619
is president.

00:10.662 --> 00:13.839
We control one remaining ICBM

00:13.883 --> 00:15.537
carrying 13 warheads.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.930
You're trying to shoot
down RE/SYST's nukes

00:17.974 --> 00:19.236
with the rail gun?

00:19.280 --> 00:20.933
If you make any attempt
to disable those nukes,

00:20.977 --> 00:22.892
RE/SYST will retaliate.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.285
Arrest this man;
he's just confessed

00:24.328 --> 00:26.287
to being an enemy of the
United States of America.

00:26.330 --> 00:29.072
Losing Mr. Cole is a blow
to the solar sail project.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.552
What about Raul Aguirre?

00:30.595 --> 00:32.771
He's the one with
the nanotechnology we need.

00:32.815 --> 00:33.990
I will meet with you,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.948
but there are certain
conditions.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.428
Release Liam Cole,

00:37.472 --> 00:40.475
and I will get RE/SYST
to call off the nukes.

00:40.518 --> 00:43.478
You had no authority
to speak with her!

00:43.521 --> 00:45.915
Jillian, what truth
did you accept today?

00:45.958 --> 00:47.960
This is the only place
I feel safe.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.009
Who the hell do
you work for?
I don't know.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.967
People lie, Fiona,

00:55.011 --> 00:57.753
but that chip
in your neck can't.

00:57.796 --> 01:00.016
Mr. President, we need to...

01:00.060 --> 01:02.105
Sir, we've lost eyes.GRACE: What are you saying?

01:02.149 --> 01:03.193
The president
of the United States

01:03.237 --> 01:04.455
just snuck out
of the White House.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.384
WOMAN:
West Wing.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.386
I'm sorry, the president
is unavailable.

01:22.430 --> 01:23.909
MAN:
West Wing.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.172
I'm sorry.

01:26.564 --> 01:27.696
Can I take a message?

01:27.739 --> 01:28.697
WOMAN:
I'm sorry.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.960
MAN:
He's in a meeting.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.745
All right, listen up.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.921
Nothing I'm about to say
leaves this room.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.314
You are not to discuss this
with anyone.

01:37.358 --> 01:41.318
Not your staff, your spouse,
or your shrink,

01:41.362 --> 01:43.494
under penalty of treason.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.105
The president is missing,

01:45.148 --> 01:47.498
and only the people
in this room are aware.

01:47.542 --> 01:50.327
Director Davis, what does
the FBI know thus far?

01:50.371 --> 01:51.850
The Secret Service had
eyes on the president

01:51.894 --> 01:54.157
at 2100 hours
in the Oval.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.550
They withdrew
to their posts outside.

01:55.593 --> 01:58.161
At 2300, they discovered
that the office was empty.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.815
Now, we believe
that he accessed

01:59.858 --> 02:02.513
the hidden Reagan staircase
to the evacuation tunnels

02:02.557 --> 02:04.167
beneath the Oval Office.

02:04.211 --> 02:07.649
We have been reviewing hours
of security cam footage,

02:07.692 --> 02:09.955
and as of yet... nothing.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.435
Anything from
the D.C. Police?

02:11.479 --> 02:13.176
We've tripled the number
of patrols inside

02:13.220 --> 02:15.874
the Beltway and put out a
description of the president.

02:15.918 --> 02:18.312
Obviously, we can't tell them
exactly who they're looking for

02:18.355 --> 02:20.662
if we wish to maintain
this level of secrecy.

02:20.705 --> 02:23.665
What about foul play?
Could someone have abducted him?

02:23.708 --> 02:25.275
Secret Service
reports that

02:25.319 --> 02:27.277
their agents never
left their posts.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.452
No one got past them.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.541
No one except
the president, you mean?

02:30.585 --> 02:33.109
Okay, we, we don't have time
to place blame, Roland.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.937
Given the recent assassinations
of President Mackenzie

02:34.980 --> 02:37.983
and Monroe Bennett, we need
to explore all possibilities.

02:38.027 --> 02:43.075
Darius... the president is
out there with no protection.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.469
All right,
his life may be in danger.

02:45.513 --> 02:48.124
In the meantime, Mr.
Secretary, we have less

02:48.168 --> 02:50.996
than 24 hours before
that rail gun test,

02:51.040 --> 02:54.174
which will lead to a nuclear
confrontation with RE/SYST.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.306
What are we
doing about it?

02:56.350 --> 02:58.308
STENDAHL:
Nothing.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.918
There's nothing
I can do.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.225
There must be something,
Dr. Stendahl.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.619
President Tanz is the only one
with the legal authority

03:04.662 --> 03:05.924
to stop the rail gun tests.

03:05.968 --> 03:08.013
The project is
under his supervision, and

03:08.057 --> 03:09.580
short of him giving me
a direct order...

03:09.624 --> 03:13.149
What if he's not available
to give you that order?

03:13.193 --> 03:17.022
What exactly is going on,
Ms. Barrows?

03:21.940 --> 03:23.942
What the...?

03:28.295 --> 03:30.253
You lied!

03:30.297 --> 03:32.255
Good morning to you.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.779
You told Darius
RE/SYST would disarm those nukes

03:34.823 --> 03:37.695
if he released me, but they are
still active, every single one.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.219
Got you out, didn't I?

03:39.262 --> 03:41.525
You made a deal,
and you went back on your word.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.092
Darius is never, ever
gonna trust us again.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.050
Trust us?

03:45.094 --> 03:47.139
He's the one who put us in
this untenable position,

03:47.183 --> 03:48.837
threw you in jail.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.839
Liam, he's gone
off the deep end.

03:50.882 --> 03:53.276
You can't deny that his
behavior is reckless.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.147
Reckless is dropping a bomb
on New York City.

03:55.191 --> 03:57.541
He's the one threatening
to use that rail gun

03:57.585 --> 03:58.977
to disarm our nukes.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.284
We're just trying
to save the planet

04:01.328 --> 04:02.807
with the solar
sail project.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.766
Yes, yes, a project
which has hit a dead end

04:04.809 --> 04:06.637
because we wouldn't
collaborate with Darius.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.944
It's happening again.His terms
were unacceptable.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.554
And we don't need
Darius Tanz.

04:10.598 --> 04:11.816
Raul Aguirre is coming.

04:11.860 --> 04:14.863
CROFT:
Mm-hmm, and so is Santa Claus.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.822
What's that supposed
to mean, Croft?

04:17.866 --> 04:19.868
It means the man hasn't
been seen in years.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.826
Rumor is
he never leaves Argentina.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.959
In fact, some people say
he never leaves the house.

04:24.002 --> 04:27.354
And other people say he's dead.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.181
Well, he sent us that message
that he's on the way.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.923
Mm-hmm, and still
there's no sign of him, hmm?

04:31.967 --> 04:33.969
All I'm saying

04:34.012 --> 04:36.841
is, waiting for the Easter Bunny
is not the answer, kids.

04:36.885 --> 04:40.758
The solar sail
is not working as is.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.239
In ten days,
if that thing is

04:43.283 --> 04:45.415
not on its way
to the gravity tractor,

04:45.459 --> 04:47.287
everything we've done

04:47.330 --> 04:49.289
is a waste.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.467
What do you mean?I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker,

04:53.510 --> 04:55.077
but the president
is currently unavailable.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.167
Unavailable? We are on the
brink of nuclear conflict.

04:58.210 --> 05:01.039
Where the hell is he?I'm still awaiting confirmation
of his schedule.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.085
I don't give a rat's ass
about his schedule, young lady.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.434
How-how did you get this job
anyway?

05:04.478 --> 05:05.827
How old are you?

05:05.870 --> 05:08.133
I don't see how that's relevant?

05:08.177 --> 05:10.048
Well, let me tell you
what isrelevant.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.268
Unless President Tanz wants
a vote of impeachment,

05:12.312 --> 05:14.923
he better make himself available
to congressional leadership.

05:14.966 --> 05:17.186
Immediately.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.944
Uh... pesos?

05:35.987 --> 05:38.599
What the hell's this?

05:38.642 --> 05:40.383
Old man?

05:40.427 --> 05:42.820
GUARD:
Whoa, whoa, sir.

05:47.521 --> 05:48.478
Sir, take it easy.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.046
All right, calm down.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.748
ALYCIA:
Hey!

05:57.792 --> 06:00.316
Stand down!
Excuse me. Back off.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.927
Raul Aguirre.
He's here.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.895
What did you tell Stendahl?

06:13.938 --> 06:16.114
Nothing, of course.
Harris, we don't know

06:16.158 --> 06:18.203
whether Darius went on
walkabout or if he's in danger,

06:18.247 --> 06:21.032
and we don't have a lot
of time to figure it out.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.339
I'm aware of that. The entire
governmental apparatus is

06:23.383 --> 06:26.211
working the problem.Yes, but weneed
to work the problem.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.952
And I know where to start.

06:35.351 --> 06:38.006
Harris, leave us alone
for a minute.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.487
It's time to chat
woman to woman.

06:50.105 --> 06:52.673
Get your hands off me.You're an enemy
of the state.

06:52.716 --> 06:53.935
You'll do exactly what we say,

06:53.978 --> 06:55.153
or you'll get the shock
of a lifetime.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.590
Do you understand me?Screw you.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.896
Without a deal on the table,
I'm done talking.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.908
That was just a taste.
This isn't a game show.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.562
There are no deals.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.956
The president
of the United States is missing,

07:14.999 --> 07:18.220
and you're gonna
help us find him. Now.

07:18.263 --> 07:21.266
♪

07:33.235 --> 07:34.541
FIONA:
I already told you.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.847
I have no idea
what happened to Darius.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.632
Perhaps your employer does.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.156
I don't know
who I work for.
Right.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.985
I think it's time
to find out, hmm?

07:46.335 --> 07:47.815
FIONA: Wait. What...? What
are you doing with that?

07:47.858 --> 07:50.208
Putting that chip
back where we found it.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.558
We're gonna
smoke them out.

07:51.601 --> 07:54.386
No. No, n-no, n-no. Please
don't. Please don't. No!

07:57.259 --> 08:00.567
I hope you know
what you're doing, Grace.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.353
Dr. Aguirre, I'm so sorry.
This is

08:04.396 --> 08:08.313
not the welcome that
we intended. I'm Alycia Vrettou.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.968
Sir, I'm Liam Cole.
I just wanted to say,

08:11.012 --> 08:12.840
I've been following your work
on nanomaterials

08:12.883 --> 08:15.364
for the last decade. No me importa.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.063
You speak Spanish, right?

08:19.107 --> 08:20.369
He's looking for a kitchen.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.545
Sir? This way.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.808
Please.

08:27.768 --> 08:30.118
NATE:
Jillian, you can't

08:30.161 --> 08:31.380
take what happened
personally.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.513
Everyone's on a short
fuse right now.

08:33.556 --> 08:34.992
Yeah, but not everyone
gets chewed out

08:35.036 --> 08:37.560
by the speaker of the house
publicly, or has

08:37.604 --> 08:38.996
a chair practically
thrown at them

08:39.040 --> 08:40.563
by the president
of the United States.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.393
Can you forget I said that?
Please?

08:44.436 --> 08:47.309
I just can't
do this anymore.

08:47.352 --> 08:50.312
So, as soon
as the latest crisis is over,

08:50.355 --> 08:53.141
and I can get a word in
with my boss,

08:53.184 --> 08:55.491
I'm going back to Boston.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.275
You're quitting?

08:57.319 --> 09:00.191
I never should have had this job
in the first place.

09:00.235 --> 09:04.195
Hey... don't do something
you're gonna regret.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.415
Come to the meeting
tonight at COPE.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.243
It'll make you
feel better.

09:08.286 --> 09:11.333
: Nate, right now,
I just feel like being alone.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.293
I'm sorry.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.475
What the hell's
he doing?
Shh.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.322
Ah.

09:56.378 --> 09:59.076
So, here's the problem.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.512
We couldn't get enough
of our original fabric

10:00.556 --> 10:01.905
for the solar sail, so

10:01.949 --> 10:04.342
we had to adapt to a thinner
fabric, one that we could

10:04.386 --> 10:06.170
acquire
on our tight schedule.

10:06.214 --> 10:09.130
Unfortunately, every time we
model the unfolding of the sail,

10:09.173 --> 10:12.524
it rips. The new fabric
cannot handle the stress.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.657
But if we use a thicker material
to prevent tearing,

10:14.701 --> 10:17.442
then the added weight makes
the payload too heavy to launch.

10:17.486 --> 10:20.576
But either way, we've got a sail
that can't do its job.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.752
LIAM: Yeah, and I was thinking
maybe there was a way

10:22.796 --> 10:24.319
to redesign the launch package,

10:24.362 --> 10:26.321
maybe use
a hexagonal design instead.

10:32.370 --> 10:35.199
LIAM:
Dr. Aguirre?

10:41.553 --> 10:44.382
Doctor.

10:44.426 --> 10:47.908
I need to think.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.610
Did he just say
"I

10:54.654 --> 10:58.396
Sounded like
"I need to drink."

11:03.227 --> 11:04.838
Dr. Aguirre.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.842
:
Aguirre.

11:08.885 --> 11:14.412
Doctor... why did you come here?

11:14.456 --> 11:16.893
Just to get drunk? Is this
some kind of a game to you?

11:16.937 --> 11:18.503
Because we're-we're
trying to save

11:18.547 --> 11:19.722
the human race
from extinction.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.377
What exactly are you
trying to do?

11:22.420 --> 11:27.208
I have come to repair...

11:27.251 --> 11:30.385
what is torn.

11:30.428 --> 11:33.301
You mean everything?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.704
You're not much
of a talker, huh?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.923
I prefer pictures.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.497
Oh, this is a...
this is a formula for...

11:55.540 --> 11:59.719
Self-repairing nanomaterials.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.334
How long have you been
working on this?

12:06.377 --> 12:08.771
Years. Many,
many, many years.

12:08.815 --> 12:12.514
Science can fix everything,

12:12.557 --> 12:14.734
except for human beings.

12:14.777 --> 12:18.650
We must fix ourselves.

12:30.619 --> 12:33.491
Hey. Look at this.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.842
OP-371 just came back online.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.452
You kidding me. Where?

12:37.495 --> 12:39.846
Four miles from here.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.630
Rock Creek Park.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.632
Her implant goes dark
for three days,

12:43.675 --> 12:44.981
our S&R teams
come up with nothing,

12:45.025 --> 12:46.417
and now she just reappears?

12:46.461 --> 12:47.810
BP's dropping.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.681
Sat levels are way down.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.248
We need an extraction team.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.207
No time. She's crashing.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.469
We got to deal
with this ourselves

12:54.512 --> 12:56.427
before we lose her.

13:04.740 --> 13:07.917
Okay, thanks
for the update.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.485
FBI is using facial
rec software to check

13:10.528 --> 13:12.530
CCTV cams from
all over D.C.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.706
ATMs, red light cameras,
the whole drill.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.492
No sign of him yet.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.886
We'll find him, Grace.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.323
You don't know that.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.718
Grace, I'm worried.

13:26.762 --> 13:27.545
About you.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.983
All this anger...

13:30.026 --> 13:32.812
it's not like you.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.205
You think you have the market
cornered on anger?

13:35.249 --> 13:37.991
My father's in prison
for a crime I committed.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.514
Alonzo's out there.
Who knows what he'll do?

13:39.557 --> 13:41.429
All because
of my bad choices.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.213
For which you blame me.

13:43.257 --> 13:46.390
It's not about blame.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.828
I just don't want
to have any more regrets.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.569
MAN:
Target acquired.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.619
HARRIS:
Maintain your distance.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.708
We don't want
to tip them off.

14:08.717 --> 14:11.372
Crap.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.947
She's gone.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.486
They took the
bait. Move out.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.277
CROFT:
Ooh, self

14:47.321 --> 14:50.237
So this is the snake oil
our friend is selling us.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.456
A solar sail that
magically heals itself

14:52.500 --> 14:53.849
after a little spritz.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.678
It's not magic, Croft,
and it's not snake oil.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.462
Oh.
Okay?

14:58.506 --> 15:01.726
It's a, uh, suspension
that coats the material

15:01.770 --> 15:03.337
in a layer of
interconnecting molecules.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.166
Now, if any connection
is broken,

15:06.209 --> 15:09.952
the molecules rearrange
themselves to repair it.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.214
Manipulating molecules
at that level?

15:11.258 --> 15:12.389
Nobody's cracked that.

15:12.433 --> 15:13.825
How do we know
it's going to work?

15:13.869 --> 15:15.262
Yeah, how about
some proof, Dr. Aguirre?

15:15.305 --> 15:18.004
Other than your scrawlings
on your vanilla latte.

15:18.047 --> 15:21.007
Dr. Aguirre, pardon the
rudeness of my colleague.

15:21.050 --> 15:25.011
No, it's-it's okay.
I-I understand.

15:25.054 --> 15:28.753
My English is not so good,
so, uh, bear with me.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.973
Science is-is just humanity

15:31.017 --> 15:33.019
in-in equations
and-and theorems.

15:33.062 --> 15:37.632
We-we are all broken
in-in some way.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.635
For the weak amongst us,

15:40.678 --> 15:45.031
it-it causes us to collapse,
but for-for the truly strong

15:45.074 --> 15:48.077
we are...
how you say in English?

15:48.121 --> 15:49.992
Tejer.
We-we knit. We knit

15:50.036 --> 15:51.907
ourselves back together

15:51.951 --> 15:56.129
to something greater
than we were before.

15:57.173 --> 16:00.611
Well, that's very poetic,
but it's not proof.

16:00.655 --> 16:03.049
Croft, let him finish.
Stop shooting him down.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.970
GUARD: What the hell
are you doing?

16:13.189 --> 16:14.408
CROFT:
What, are you crazy?!

16:14.451 --> 16:17.106
You could've killed us.Quiet.

16:30.293 --> 16:33.253
Now we go to work.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.481
That was...
Amazing.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.440
Ah!
I have to admit,
you were right

16:46.483 --> 16:47.658
about Aguirre being
the missing piece.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.399
I'm sorry I doubted you.

16:49.443 --> 16:52.446
Oh. Congratulations
to both of us.

16:52.489 --> 16:53.969
All of us, every single one.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.972
We have to tell Nero.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.582
Well, thanks to Aguirre,

16:58.626 --> 16:59.757
the rest of the scientists

16:59.801 --> 17:01.411
are committed
to finishing the solar sail.

17:01.455 --> 17:02.978
You know, we can finally
disarm those nukes

17:03.022 --> 17:05.589
and put an end to this
conflict with Darius.

17:05.633 --> 17:06.851
Liam.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.505
If not now, then when?

17:08.549 --> 17:11.030
Those nukes are the only thing
that's keeping Darius

17:11.073 --> 17:13.641
from launching a frontal assault
and taking us all out.

17:13.684 --> 17:16.078
We'd be foolish to take them
off the table now.

17:16.122 --> 17:19.168
But for the first time ever,
we have a fully functioning plan

17:19.212 --> 17:20.604
to save the world.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.954
Let's not blow it up
before we get the chance.

17:22.998 --> 17:26.784
We've got greater aspirations
when we take down the asteroid.

17:26.828 --> 17:29.613
Look, if we truly want
to change the world,

17:29.657 --> 17:30.962
we need leverage.

17:31.006 --> 17:35.402
There is no plan
to give them up, is there?

17:35.445 --> 17:38.187
We're the new superpower.

17:38.231 --> 17:41.451
Everything that we've been
fighting for-- free speech,

17:41.495 --> 17:44.193
freedom of information,
power to the people--

17:44.237 --> 17:47.066
we can finally make it so.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.110
And in the meantime,
you're just gonna

17:48.154 --> 17:49.459
drop a bomb on New York City.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.765
You're not gonna lose
an ounce of sleep.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.549
Darius started that.And you're gonna finish it.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.116
And you're gonna kill
millions of people.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.815
After this project's done, so
are we. RE/SYST can go to hell.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.861
Liam.

17:59.904 --> 18:02.429
Hey.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.261
And as the standoff continues

18:08.304 --> 18:09.523
between RE/SYST
and President Tanz,

18:09.566 --> 18:12.439
the president has been
strangely silent.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.136
With the rail gun test
scheduled to go off

18:14.180 --> 18:15.964
just 12 hours from now,

18:16.007 --> 18:19.402
New Yorkers are fleeing
the city in droves.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.541
Hi.
Nate.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.282
What are you doing here?

18:29.325 --> 18:30.544
You seemed so down today,

18:30.587 --> 18:32.372
I thought maybe
I could cheer you up.

18:32.415 --> 18:33.634
And I came bearing gifts.

18:33.677 --> 18:37.594
Remember Bass Shepherd?

18:37.638 --> 18:39.640
Hello, Jillian.
Can we come in?

18:40.684 --> 18:41.946
Uh...

18:41.990 --> 18:44.166
Sure. Come.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.521
:
What?

18:59.225 --> 19:01.488
Let's go.MAN: Copy that.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.794
We're in position.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.815
Tech Con One, we've entered
the warehouse.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.385
MAN 2:
Bravo Team, hold for Alpha.

19:31.431 --> 19:34.608
Bravo Team, we're on
the passenger. Weapons free.

19:34.651 --> 19:38.002
MAN:
Copy that, Alpha. Good hunting.

19:38.046 --> 19:40.048
Freeze! Nobody move!

19:40.091 --> 19:42.790
Gun down, gun down!

19:42.833 --> 19:45.836
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't shoot,
don't shoot, don't shoot.

19:45.880 --> 19:49.100
MAN:
Area's secure, Mr. Secretary.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.624
She's over here.

19:50.667 --> 19:51.799
Clear.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.982
Give her the shot. Now!

20:02.592 --> 20:03.550
What's happening?

20:03.593 --> 20:05.160
The atropine's
not working.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.553
What?

20:06.596 --> 20:07.728
We waited too long.

20:07.771 --> 20:08.946
No. Give her
another injection.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.034
She could stroke out.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.297
She's gonna die.

20:17.955 --> 20:20.349
Come on. Come on! Fiona!

20:24.527 --> 20:26.486
You son of a bitch.

20:28.879 --> 20:31.969
She was dead.
What'd you do to her?TTX.

20:32.013 --> 20:34.363
It's a paralytic agent
found in blowfish poison.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.713
Slows heart rate and
inhibits motor function.

20:36.757 --> 20:39.150
Now we get a question.
Where's Darius Tanz?

20:39.194 --> 20:40.761
The president?

20:40.804 --> 20:42.763
If you know anything
about his whereabouts...

20:42.806 --> 20:45.505
I don't.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.811
I'm not playing.

20:49.378 --> 20:52.163
I don't know
anything. I swear.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.122
Then who do you work for?

20:54.165 --> 20:59.170
You're an accessory to the
assassination of Monroe Bennett.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.129
You don't give us something,
you're gonna be spending

21:01.172 --> 21:02.261
the rest of your life

21:02.304 --> 21:05.351
in a very
unpleasant place.

21:05.394 --> 21:08.876
Company policy regarding clients
is on a "need to know" basis.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.269
What company?

21:11.922 --> 21:13.489
Maybe we'll put the word out

21:13.533 --> 21:15.622
that you're
cooperating with us.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.406
How would your employer
feel about that?

21:17.450 --> 21:19.843
They have eyes everywhere.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.062
HARRIS:
Who?

21:21.105 --> 21:24.065
Q-17.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.027
GRACE:
Harris?

21:30.071 --> 21:32.682
Q-17.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.075
GRACE:
What's Q

21:34.118 --> 21:36.860
They're like a private
CIA. Off the grid.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.645
You want to hire them,
you have to know somebody.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.037
Otherwise, they're ghosts.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.648
Well, someone did hire them.

21:41.691 --> 21:44.477
To sabotage the Ark,
blow up the Supreme Court,

21:44.520 --> 21:46.609
and assassinate
a couple of presidents.

21:46.653 --> 21:48.916
Well, we still haven't tied them
to Mackenzie's death.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.178
But if each of those

21:50.221 --> 21:52.702
is one of their
operatives...

21:52.746 --> 21:54.878
The scope of this thing
is massive.

21:54.922 --> 21:59.187
The question is,
who's pulling their strings?

21:59.230 --> 22:02.843
And is Darius next
on their list?

22:02.886 --> 22:05.759
Harris, we're running
out of time.

22:07.891 --> 22:10.372
JILLIAN:
So...

22:10.416 --> 22:12.374
what are you doing here?

22:12.418 --> 22:14.985
Ah, when one of our members
is in need, we come.

22:15.029 --> 22:17.510
That is incredibly
generous.

22:17.553 --> 22:20.208
Well, you're special.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.993
I've seen that since
the first moment I met you.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.692
Really?

22:25.735 --> 22:27.955
You have wisdom
beyond your years.

22:27.998 --> 22:31.306
Why do you think the president
chose you as his assistant

22:31.350 --> 22:33.264
over all the other people
out there?

22:33.308 --> 22:34.788
I don't know,

22:34.831 --> 22:39.619
but I'm assuming
he regrets it right about now.

22:39.662 --> 22:42.709
So the speaker of the House
dressed you down.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.972
Mm-hmm.The president got angry.

22:45.015 --> 22:46.800
Those aren't reasons to quit.

22:46.843 --> 22:49.846
They're lessons.

22:49.890 --> 22:53.328
The universe has much to teach

22:53.372 --> 22:55.417
if you listen.Oh, I am trying,

22:55.461 --> 22:57.680
but can it speak up a little?

23:04.165 --> 23:07.995
Can you accept
that you have a purpose?

23:09.997 --> 23:12.173
I can.

23:12.216 --> 23:17.570
When a tree is strong, even a
hurricane wind cannot uproot it.

23:17.613 --> 23:20.747
You are strong.

23:20.790 --> 23:22.792
You are wise.

23:22.836 --> 23:25.621
Don't let other people
blow you off your path.

23:41.942 --> 23:43.900
And what's this?

23:43.944 --> 23:46.686
Pisco. You drink.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.690
I don't think so.

23:50.733 --> 23:53.780
Drink, drink, it's
good for the constitution.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.307
Who cares?

24:04.355 --> 24:06.923
You know, 'cause
it's over.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.621
Everything I-I've
believed in,

24:08.664 --> 24:11.232
every choice I have made
has been wrong.

24:11.275 --> 24:16.019
I tried to save the world and
I actually made things worse.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.721
And Darius was right
about... RE/SYST,

24:21.764 --> 24:23.723
about Alycia, all of it.

24:23.766 --> 24:26.334
Every little thing.

24:29.729 --> 24:30.947
What am I doing?

24:30.991 --> 24:32.253
I mean, you probably
can't even understand

24:32.296 --> 24:33.733
half of what I'm saying.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.519
I understand.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.913
More than you know.

24:42.089 --> 24:43.786
:
Just because you're brilliant

24:43.830 --> 24:45.005
doesn't mean
you're always right.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.140
You're still gonna need
that rail gun

24:50.184 --> 24:52.186
to help with the solar sail.

24:52.229 --> 24:55.276
D

24:55.319 --> 24:56.930
: Listen,
we haven't got much time.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.975
ALYCIA:
Gentlemen?

25:01.021 --> 25:02.936
Am I interrupting
anything?

25:02.979 --> 25:06.374
U-Un brindis
por nuevos comienzos.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.507
A toast to new beginnings.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.509
I drink to this.
Yes.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.266
What the hell, Darius?
What's going on?

25:29.310 --> 25:30.790
Where's the real Dr. Aguirre?

25:30.833 --> 25:32.313
Standing right in front of you.

25:32.356 --> 25:33.880
What are you talking about?

25:33.923 --> 25:36.273
Ten years ago,

25:36.317 --> 25:40.408
I created an alter ego,
a nom de plume if you will.

25:40.451 --> 25:44.543
Thus, Dr. Raul Aguirre was born.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.153
But, uh, w

25:46.196 --> 25:47.415
I wanted to
publish certain

25:47.458 --> 25:49.373
controversial research

25:49.417 --> 25:51.201
that was outside
my area of expertise.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.290
Nanomaterials.Yeah.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.553
But the alias stuck,
and-and over time,

25:54.596 --> 25:56.250
the ruse grew more elaborate.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.339
There was a great demand
for the talents of Dr. Aguirre.

25:58.382 --> 25:59.949
So I turned him into a recluse,

25:59.993 --> 26:03.213
uh, an eccentric who
never went anywhere.

26:03.257 --> 26:05.259
Until now.Okay, so-so,

26:05.302 --> 26:06.782
you're pretending
to be Aguirre, but...

26:06.826 --> 26:10.917
but why, is it to sneak in
and sabotage the solar sail?

26:10.960 --> 26:13.702
No, the solar sail is brilliant.

26:13.746 --> 26:15.182
Combined with the
rail gun, it may be

26:15.225 --> 26:17.053
our only hope for survival.

26:17.097 --> 26:19.012
Is this the part where
you tell me that I was right?

26:19.055 --> 26:20.274
Partially right.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.015
You still needed
Dr. Aguirre to solve

26:22.058 --> 26:23.320
your materials problem.All right, it doesn't matter,

26:23.364 --> 26:24.844
it doesn't matter.
I want to know why

26:24.887 --> 26:26.672
you went through all this
to help RE/SYST.

26:26.715 --> 26:29.892
I didn't come here to help.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.851
I needed to get
inside Tanz,

26:31.894 --> 26:35.115
and-and Aguirre
was my entry point.

26:35.158 --> 26:38.640
I'm here to prevent
a nuclear holocaust.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.643
Well, I mean,
you started all of this.

26:41.687 --> 26:44.124
I shouldn't even
be talking to you.

26:44.167 --> 26:46.909
After what you did?
I mean, you threw me in a jail.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.520
You were talking to me like
I was, I was a criminal.

26:49.564 --> 26:52.001
You left me no choice.

26:52.045 --> 26:54.613
Liam.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.661
I did come here to repair
what's been torn.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.577
The two of us have the
power to shut it down

27:02.621 --> 27:06.363
and get back
to what we do: science.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.844
But I need your help.

27:12.152 --> 27:15.459
This chip contains a virus
that'll destroy Tess.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.636
She's the one
controlling those nukes.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.103
DAVIS:
Is this all of it?

27:51.626 --> 27:53.628
Yeah, every last scrap of paper
and digital file

27:53.672 --> 27:55.282
from that warehouse.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.066
Should give us a window
into Q-17's

27:57.110 --> 27:58.285
current operations.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.156
My team will analyze
the documents.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.984
If there's anything of use,
we'll find it.

28:02.028 --> 28:03.769
Yeah.But meantime,

28:03.812 --> 28:06.119
still no sign of the president.

28:06.162 --> 28:08.512
We've come up empty,
Mr. Secretary.

28:08.556 --> 28:11.951
We've got eight hours until
that rail gun fires, Harris.

28:11.994 --> 28:17.434
We need to make some big moves,
and nobody's gonna like them.

28:19.306 --> 28:22.135
You know the plan:
get into the server room.

28:22.178 --> 28:23.745
If this doesn't work...

28:23.789 --> 28:25.138
We're in the same position
we're in right now,

28:25.181 --> 28:26.748
with time running out
and RE/SYST's finger

28:26.792 --> 28:28.271
on the nuclear button.

28:28.315 --> 28:30.099
:
We've got nothing to lose.

28:30.143 --> 28:31.884
Liam?

28:31.927 --> 28:33.537
What's going on?
You said it was important.

28:33.581 --> 28:38.978
Yeah. There's something you need
to know about Dr. Aguirre.

28:40.022 --> 28:41.981
Liam, no!

28:42.024 --> 28:43.112
Are you insane?
What are you...?

28:43.156 --> 28:45.549
LIAM:
There's a traitor in our midst.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.769
Traitor

28:49.249 --> 28:51.033
Darius?

28:53.122 --> 28:55.124
LIAM: I'm sorry,
Darius, but sometimes,

28:55.168 --> 28:57.039
you can't repair what's torn.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.836
HARRIS:
Dr. Stendahl,

29:10.879 --> 29:13.621
that rail gun test cannot
go forward as planned.

29:13.664 --> 29:15.318
I'm under orders from the
president of the United States.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.320
He's the only one
that can stop this test.

29:17.364 --> 29:19.801
We know, Rosetta,
but the president

29:19.845 --> 29:21.847
is missing.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.154
We have to stop this
before it's too late.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.590
In the absence

29:26.634 --> 29:27.983
of the president,
I am giving you

29:28.027 --> 29:30.769
a direct order
to stop this test...

29:30.812 --> 29:34.381
Wait, after all
that's gone on: civil war,

29:34.424 --> 29:37.950
coups, how do I know
that you're not the traitors?

29:37.993 --> 29:39.952
How do I know
that you're not

29:39.995 --> 29:42.781
the ones responsible
for his disappearance?

29:42.824 --> 29:45.696
You're gonna have
to trust us.

29:49.439 --> 29:52.616
I never thought physical
violence was your style.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.662
What were you expecting?

29:54.705 --> 29:56.098
Harsh language?

29:57.752 --> 30:00.799
You have no idea
what's at stake here, do you?

30:00.842 --> 30:03.453
Other than the blood of millions
of innocent civilians

30:03.497 --> 30:05.847
on your hands, I suppose no.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.936
I'm not the one responsible.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.982
You can make this go away.

30:10.025 --> 30:12.680
All you have to do
is hand over the rail gun.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.987
Why don't you just steal it?
You're so very good at that,

30:15.030 --> 30:18.207
aren't you?I didn't steal anything.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.209
I created Tess.

30:20.253 --> 30:22.516
Ugh, again with that.
Wecreated Tess.

30:22.559 --> 30:25.911
And you tried to smuggle out her
source code, but I caught you.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.305
No, you destroyed

30:29.349 --> 30:32.526
my reputation, Darius.

30:32.569 --> 30:34.920
You ruined my career.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.095
No.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.488
You did that.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.055
On your own.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.979
I know where
you came from, Alycia.

30:51.023 --> 30:55.288
A father who treated you
like nothing,

30:55.331 --> 30:56.985
made you feel like nothing.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.857
We had that in common.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.772
It's what made us who we are.

31:01.816 --> 31:06.516
Ruthless perfectionists.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.868
But when you came to me
that day at Tanz,

31:09.911 --> 31:13.306
a disaffected college grad
who snuck away from the tour

31:13.349 --> 31:16.004
to show me her
machine-learning algorithm,

31:16.048 --> 31:20.095
I saw your brilliance, talent.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.923
Your drive.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.969
I nurtured you.

31:24.012 --> 31:27.363
Believed in you.

31:27.407 --> 31:32.934
But... somewhere along the way,

31:32.978 --> 31:36.242
you lost your way.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.635
And you have
the chance right now

31:38.679 --> 31:41.682
to come back from the darkness.

31:41.725 --> 31:44.554
Take it before it's too late.

31:49.733 --> 31:53.433
You have 15 minutes to
change your mind, Darius.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.435
If that rail gun goes off,

31:55.478 --> 31:57.959
Tess will automatically
fire those missiles.

31:58.003 --> 32:00.831
The blood's on your hands,
not mine.

32:00.875 --> 32:03.834
Alycia, you still need me.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.010
Go to hell, Darius.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.272
Wait. Just...

32:11.538 --> 32:12.931
Liam.

32:14.019 --> 32:15.759
What are you doing?

32:15.803 --> 32:17.239
Croft.

32:17.283 --> 32:19.546
Look, it's not
what you think, Croft.

32:19.589 --> 32:21.287
L-Look, we finally have hope.

32:21.330 --> 32:22.810
I am not gonna let you
sabotage it.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.307
Don't be an idiot.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.178
You got Stockholm syndrome.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.963
You're identifying
with your captors.You're the idiot.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.965
This is not the time
to undermine RE/SYST.

32:47.008 --> 32:49.054
We have Aguirre; he is
gonna save the world.

32:49.097 --> 32:51.012
Aguirre is Darius.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.928
What?

32:53.972 --> 32:57.105
MAN: All personnel, firing test
begins in eight minutes.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.977
Please clear the area.

33:05.722 --> 33:08.421
MAN: Security measures
have been initiated.

33:08.464 --> 33:10.423
All computer systems are now
in lockdown mode.

33:10.466 --> 33:12.033
What's going on?

33:12.077 --> 33:14.383
Darius changed the codes.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.255
I'm locked out.

33:16.298 --> 33:18.474
He's the only one
that can stop the test.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.694
There's nothing I can do.

33:20.737 --> 33:23.175
That rail gun is launching
in seven minutes, Grace,

33:23.218 --> 33:25.090
whether we like it or not.

33:31.879 --> 33:35.056
Thank you, General.
We've done all we can.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.885
They've been evacuating
the entire tristate area

33:37.928 --> 33:39.887
for the last 24 hours
to prevent loss of life.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.454
Harris, none of this
makes sense.

33:41.497 --> 33:44.674
And the way Darius disappeared.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.676
I know it's crazy,
but is it possible

33:46.720 --> 33:49.766
this is all some elaborate
"Darius" plan?

33:49.810 --> 33:53.422
If it is, it better work, fast.

33:55.076 --> 33:55.990
NEWSWOMAN:
As the rail gun test

33:56.034 --> 33:58.601
is set to launch imminently,

33:58.645 --> 34:01.126
RE/SYST's nuclear threat
hangs over our head.

34:01.169 --> 34:03.867
And still no sign
of our president.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.044
All right, I need
to address the group.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.785
Where's Liam?

34:08.829 --> 34:13.094
Is it true that Aguirre
is Darius Tanz?

34:13.138 --> 34:15.053
W-We deserve answers.

34:15.096 --> 34:18.012
Yes.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.842
I guess Liam beat me
to the punch with the news.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.974
But Darius
will cooperate fully

34:24.018 --> 34:26.020
and he will continue to help us
with our project,

34:26.064 --> 34:27.413
so there's no reason
to be concerned.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.067
Really?

34:29.110 --> 34:30.503
Well, that's-that's
good to know.

34:30.546 --> 34:31.504
Yeah, that's good.

34:31.547 --> 34:32.853
Thank you.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.464
Where'd that come from?

34:35.508 --> 34:37.205
Uh, this? Um...

34:39.773 --> 34:42.515
No idea.

34:43.994 --> 34:45.083
Hand it over.

34:50.436 --> 34:54.135
Hand it over now
or they will shoot.

34:55.658 --> 34:59.184
Well, frankly...

35:00.402 --> 35:02.839
...at this point,

35:02.883 --> 35:05.451
I don't give a damn.
Liam, catch!

35:10.108 --> 35:12.545
No, Croft!

35:13.502 --> 35:15.809
No. Stand down. I got this.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.941
MAN:
20 seconds till firing sequence.

35:17.985 --> 35:21.336
Clear the range.
Repeat: clear the range.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.519
MAN:
Six... five...

35:32.608 --> 35:33.522
Liam!

35:34.958 --> 35:36.482
MAN:
...four... three...

35:36.525 --> 35:38.484
Liam! Don't.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.142
MAN:
Fire.

35:47.493 --> 35:48.798
You killed her.

35:52.976 --> 35:55.065
She wasn't yours to kill!

35:55.109 --> 35:58.895
Who

36:00.288 --> 36:01.855
She's lines of code.

36:01.898 --> 36:04.640
:
No.

36:04.684 --> 36:08.644
You just executed a
human being down there.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.431
Am I next?

36:14.128 --> 36:16.609
Am I?

36:25.400 --> 36:27.663
Too many casualties.

36:30.405 --> 36:33.495
It's time to stop the war,
Alycia.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.678
W-Wait a minute,
you're saying...

36:42.722 --> 36:45.464
the missiles didn't fire?

36:45.507 --> 36:46.987
Mr. Secretary, look.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.858
The rail gun slug
is tracking on course.

36:48.902 --> 36:51.426
In five, four,

36:51.470 --> 36:52.819
three...

36:57.824 --> 36:59.521
Yeah!

37:02.394 --> 37:06.311
It's over.
It's over.

37:06.354 --> 37:08.617
RE/SYST's nukes
are destroyed.

37:08.661 --> 37:09.966
Oh, my God.

37:10.010 --> 37:11.838
How...?

37:15.842 --> 37:18.323
Darius.

37:18.366 --> 37:19.976
It's him.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.500
Breaking news into
the station just now.

37:21.543 --> 37:22.805
We are getting reports

37:22.849 --> 37:26.722
that the ICBM-carrying RE/SYST
nuclear warheads

37:26.766 --> 37:27.767
have been destroyed.

37:27.810 --> 37:30.770
Oh, my...

37:36.297 --> 37:37.777
It took you long enough.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.126
I'm sorry.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.694
I was disarming 13 nukes.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.739
You can't rush
something like that.

37:45.175 --> 37:47.830
There you go.

37:49.310 --> 37:50.790
Welcome back.

37:54.054 --> 37:55.751
Where's Alycia?

37:55.795 --> 37:57.579
She packed her
bags and fled.

37:57.623 --> 37:58.667
Problem for another day.

38:05.892 --> 38:08.416
You're not gonna
believe this, but...

38:08.460 --> 38:10.723
he died a hero.

38:11.811 --> 38:14.422
These days...

38:14.466 --> 38:16.555
I'll believe anything.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.953
Thank God you're back.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.912
I have been holding
everyone off,

38:25.955 --> 38:27.522
but they want
to see Darius.

38:27.566 --> 38:29.655
Don't we all. Any word?

38:29.698 --> 38:31.091
Nothing yet.

38:31.134 --> 38:32.701
Speaker Barnes is waiting
in the Cabinet Room

38:32.745 --> 38:35.138
with the rest of
Congressional leadership.

38:35.182 --> 38:37.358
I guess it's time
to face the music.

38:42.145 --> 38:44.365
Thank you all for your patience.

38:44.409 --> 38:46.193
As you know, President Tanz
has been incredibly busy

38:46.236 --> 38:47.586
managing this crisis.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.675
We'll have
more information shortly.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.067
If you'll just return
to your offices...

38:51.111 --> 38:52.330
BARNES:
Enough stalling.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.548
Where the hell is the president

38:53.592 --> 38:54.984
of the United States?

38:55.028 --> 38:58.292
ROLAND: Mr. Secretary,
Ms. Barrows, it's time.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.990
As White House counsel,
I'm afraid I have to inform you

39:01.034 --> 39:02.383
of some troubling news.Roland.

39:02.427 --> 39:03.993
I'm afraid President Tanz is...

39:04.037 --> 39:05.778
DARIUS;
Is right here.

39:05.821 --> 39:06.779
Thank you for standing in,

39:06.822 --> 39:08.389
Ms. Barrows.
Mr. Secretary.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.783
Everyone, I hear you've
all been looking for me.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.872
I was extremely busy
disarming RE/SYST.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.656
Those nukes were quite
the nuisance,

39:14.700 --> 39:16.615
weren't they?

39:16.658 --> 39:19.182
So... what have you all
been doing

39:19.226 --> 39:21.054
for the last 24 hours?

39:33.632 --> 39:35.895
Next time you pull a stunt
like that, you could at least

39:35.938 --> 39:37.287
have the decency
to tell someone.

39:37.331 --> 39:39.202
Anyone.You scared the hell out of us.

39:39.246 --> 39:42.205
I'm sorry. Truly.

39:42.249 --> 39:45.687
But it became impossible for me
to get anything done here.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.646
I-I had to follow
my instincts.

39:47.689 --> 39:48.908
The entire country

39:48.951 --> 39:50.823
could have blown up.But it didn't.

39:50.866 --> 39:53.521
And for one day,
for one moment,

39:53.565 --> 39:56.045
we're gonna take
the victory.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.918
Now, if you don't mind,

39:58.961 --> 40:01.921
I-I'd like a word alone
with my senior advisor.

40:04.532 --> 40:06.534
