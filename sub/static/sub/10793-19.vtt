WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:03.900
This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

00:04.799 --> 00:06.700
We are going to survive,

00:06.800 --> 00:09.200
we are going to make it home.

00:09.899 --> 00:12.900
I'm telling you, the ship
came here for a reason!

00:13.280 --> 00:16.383
Destiny is powered by
the stars themselves.

00:16.967 --> 00:19.169
He and Young are
bumping heads, yes.

00:19.170 --> 00:21.938
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.474
We just pretend
nothing happened.

00:23.475 --> 00:25.875
We need to be ready
for the next encounter...

00:25.876 --> 00:27.377
For the sake of the crew.

00:27.378 --> 00:29.779
For the sake of the crew.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.148
You dreamt you were the spy

00:31.149 --> 00:33.082
who leaked everything about
Icarus to the Lucian alliance.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.851
No, no, it wasn't me.

00:34.852 --> 00:36.386
I was Colonel Telford.

00:36.387 --> 00:39.122
We know that the Goa'uld
had brainwashing technology.

00:39.123 --> 00:41.991
It is possible that the alliance
now has that capability.

00:41.992 --> 00:44.194
Once you are on Earth,
you are on your own.

00:44.195 --> 00:46.463
Whoever you are, you must be using
the ancient communication stones.

00:46.464 --> 00:48.031
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:48.032 --> 00:50.066
Colonel Telford would
never make such a mistake.

00:50.067 --> 00:52.335
We know that
you are a traitor

00:52.336 --> 00:53.436
and a murderer.

00:53.437 --> 00:54.904
Now we know
you're a coward too.

00:57.308 --> 00:58.341
You've found
another Icarus planet.

00:58.342 --> 00:59.509
We're all very excited

00:59.510 --> 01:00.910
to have Dr. Rush's
full cooperation.

01:00.911 --> 01:02.378
Kill me and you kill Rush!

01:02.379 --> 01:04.147
Begin venting
the atmosphere

01:04.149 --> 01:06.950
<i>in Colonel Telford's
quarters now.</i>

01:09.954 --> 01:12.989
You! Open this damn door!

01:17.027 --> 01:18.962
We both know you're
not going to kill me.

01:27.704 --> 01:29.772
Mr. Brody, this is Wray.

01:29.773 --> 01:31.140
You need to restore
the atmosphere...

01:31.141 --> 01:32.175
<i>This is Young.</i>

01:32.176 --> 01:34.545
Please disregard that request.

01:36.613 --> 01:38.447
<i>By letting this happen,</i>

01:38.448 --> 01:40.116
<i>you are participating</i>

01:40.117 --> 01:42.018
<i>in not only the murder
of Colonel Telford,</i>

01:42.019 --> 01:44.187
but Dr. Rush as well.

01:53.130 --> 01:54.330
Okay.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.165
Sir, you've made
your point.

01:56.166 --> 01:59.035
I'm not trying
to make a point.

02:07.211 --> 02:08.244
Come on!

02:08.245 --> 02:09.544
Open the door, sir, please...

02:09.545 --> 02:10.680
I know what I'm doing.

02:10.681 --> 02:11.714
What you're doing
is killing him!

02:11.715 --> 02:12.748
I know that, Lieutenant.

02:12.749 --> 02:13.783
Brody!

02:13.784 --> 02:15.451
What should we do?

02:15.452 --> 02:17.654
The Colonel's bluffing.
He's not going to kill him.

02:26.762 --> 02:27.798
What's happening to him?

02:33.437 --> 02:35.506
All right... no.

02:35.507 --> 02:36.772
Sir, I cannot...

03:17.114 --> 03:18.515
You've killed him.

03:24.388 --> 03:25.421
Brody.

03:43.273 --> 03:44.440
Come on, David.

03:47.544 --> 03:48.611
David, come on.

03:54.885 --> 03:56.118
You're all in danger.

03:56.119 --> 03:57.153
What?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.521
They're coming.

03:58.522 --> 04:00.156
Who's coming?

04:00.157 --> 04:01.457
The Lucian alliance.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.158
They're coming to take Destiny.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
Stargate Universe
s01e19 Incursion Part1

04:20.855 --> 04:22.256
<i>We've been informed</i>

04:22.257 --> 04:24.325
<i>that this ship
faces an incursion</i>

04:24.326 --> 04:26.861
<i>by armed forces of
the Lucian alliance.</i>

04:26.862 --> 04:28.162
<i>The group responsible</i>

04:28.163 --> 04:30.565
<i>for the attack on Icarus base.</i>

04:30.566 --> 04:32.767
<i>All military
personnel on board</i>

04:32.768 --> 04:34.603
<i>have been placed
on high alert.</i>

04:34.604 --> 04:38.605
<i>If the enemy has acquired
the means to dial Destiny,</i>

04:38.606 --> 04:40.875
<i>their point of ingress
will be the stargate.</i>

04:40.876 --> 04:42.310
Brody, we're clear.

04:42.311 --> 04:46.914
<i>So the gateroom
is off-limits.</i>

04:46.915 --> 04:49.650
<i>All surrounding corridors
have been placed in lockdown.</i>

04:49.651 --> 04:55.790
<i>No one may enter
without proper authorization.</i>

04:55.791 --> 04:57.692
<i>I've provided
homeworld security</i>

04:57.693 --> 04:59.293
<i>With intel</i>

04:59.294 --> 05:01.494
<i>On the planet from which
the Lucian alliance</i>

05:01.495 --> 05:04.398
<i>Intends to launch
their assault.</i>

05:04.399 --> 05:09.403
<i>They're dispatching forces
as I speak.</i>

05:13.275 --> 05:15.309
The best-case scenario,

05:15.310 --> 05:17.378
Earth forces
take the launch point intact

05:17.379 --> 05:19.814
And we gain a supply line
from home.

05:19.815 --> 05:22.416
The worst-case scenario

05:22.417 --> 05:24.518
Is that our forces don't make it
before the attack is launched,

05:24.519 --> 05:25.820
In which case

05:25.821 --> 05:27.889
We'll have to deal with them
on our end.

05:27.890 --> 05:30.891
In that event,
all non-military personnel

05:30.892 --> 05:32.861
Will be ordered back
to your quarters,

05:32.862 --> 05:34.327
Where you will remain

05:34.328 --> 05:36.297
Until the situation
has been resolved.

05:36.298 --> 05:37.698
Make no mistake...

05:37.699 --> 05:40.535
This will be dealt with
swiftly and decisively.

05:40.536 --> 05:41.836
Thank you. That is all.

05:50.379 --> 05:51.445
Colonel.

05:56.285 --> 05:57.985
Only a couple
of hours ago,

05:57.986 --> 06:00.321
Colonel Telford admitted
to being a mole

06:00.322 --> 06:01.856
for the Lucian alliance.

06:01.857 --> 06:04.491
And now, suddenly,
he's on our side?

06:04.492 --> 06:05.526
Yeah.

06:05.527 --> 06:06.560
You trust him?

06:06.561 --> 06:07.595
I didn't say that.

06:13.635 --> 06:15.636
What in the hell
was that?

06:15.637 --> 06:16.971
<i>"What in the hell
was that, sir?"</i>

06:16.972 --> 06:18.005
All you had to do
was tell me.

06:18.006 --> 06:19.039
I was keeping you out of it.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.941
You didn't have to.

06:20.942 --> 06:23.443
If I'd known killing him
and bringing him back

06:23.444 --> 06:25.646
was the only way to beat that
brainwashing technology,

06:25.647 --> 06:27.014
I'd have been
behind you 100%.

06:27.015 --> 06:28.216
So you'll follow orders

06:28.217 --> 06:29.750
as long as I explain
everything beforehand?

06:29.751 --> 06:32.020
No, sir, that is not
what I meant...

06:32.021 --> 06:33.121
That's great,
because if it was,

06:33.122 --> 06:34.389
We'd have a problem,
Lieutenant.

06:34.390 --> 06:35.657
Do we have a problem?

06:38.660 --> 06:39.994
No, sir...

06:39.995 --> 06:42.262
Good, because now
is not the time for that.

06:47.736 --> 06:49.904
No headaches or blurred vision?

06:49.905 --> 06:52.973
No. I told you, I'm fine.

06:55.576 --> 06:56.911
Well, Rush is fine.

06:56.912 --> 06:58.144
I'll find out about me
when I switch back.

06:58.145 --> 07:01.949
Look, I really
need to go, and...

07:01.950 --> 07:03.116
TJ.

07:03.117 --> 07:05.219
Can you give us a minute?

07:05.220 --> 07:06.253
Yes, sir.

07:06.254 --> 07:07.288
Thanks.

07:11.293 --> 07:14.061
How are you feeling, David?

07:17.732 --> 07:18.899
Confused.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.867
I bet.

07:23.204 --> 07:25.239
You went the whole
nine yards.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.273
To the brink
and back.

07:26.274 --> 07:27.308
I had to.

07:27.309 --> 07:28.642
You know, in my defense,

07:28.643 --> 07:29.944
It wasn't the first thing
I tried.

07:29.945 --> 07:33.147
Yeah. Thanks for that.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.616
At least the brainwashing

07:34.617 --> 07:36.784
Explains why you've been
such an ass.

07:42.258 --> 07:43.991
I've read
the sg mission reports

07:43.992 --> 07:45.693
Of that method being done
in the past.

07:45.694 --> 07:47.161
I just never...

07:52.100 --> 07:53.467
You have no idea what it's like

07:53.468 --> 07:55.002
To remember things
that you've done

07:55.003 --> 07:56.136
That...

08:04.613 --> 08:06.013
Terrible things.

08:06.014 --> 08:09.115
You weren't yourself, David.

08:13.855 --> 08:15.256
You've got to send me back.

08:15.257 --> 08:16.689
Not yet.

08:16.690 --> 08:17.825
I've done all that I can
on this end...

08:17.826 --> 08:19.192
I've already killed you once...

08:19.193 --> 08:20.228
I'm more useful to you
in my own body

08:20.229 --> 08:21.261
Back there with them.

08:21.262 --> 08:22.731
You know that.

08:22.732 --> 08:23.897
How else will you
get Rush back?

08:23.898 --> 08:25.633
- Listen...
- get him out of there.

08:25.634 --> 08:27.668
David, you've just come back
from the dead.

08:27.669 --> 08:30.838
I want you to get
your strength back first.

08:39.914 --> 08:41.815
Excuse us.

08:42.851 --> 08:43.951
TJ.

08:43.952 --> 08:45.719
Listen, when they come,

08:45.720 --> 08:47.821
I want you here, safe.

08:47.822 --> 08:49.957
Safe?

08:49.958 --> 08:53.161
If they break containment,
there could be wounded.

08:53.162 --> 08:54.761
We're going to need you.

08:54.762 --> 08:56.830
What we'll need
is a real doctor.

08:56.831 --> 08:57.931
You're up for this.

08:57.932 --> 08:59.166
Not even close.

08:59.167 --> 09:01.902
What are you planning to do?

09:01.903 --> 09:03.405
Evacuate the atmosphere
in the gateroom

09:03.406 --> 09:04.904
The minute they step through.

09:04.905 --> 09:07.841
Kill them all, you mean.

09:07.842 --> 09:10.310
You think I have a choice?

09:10.311 --> 09:12.846
If you're asking
for forgiveness,

09:12.847 --> 09:15.115
I can't help
you there either.

09:16.184 --> 09:17.217
TJ...

09:17.218 --> 09:19.086
I'll do my best.

09:31.233 --> 09:33.233
You're back.

09:36.204 --> 09:38.372
That was me.

09:38.373 --> 09:41.275
I had to see
whether you were faking.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.444
Well, I wasn't.

09:43.445 --> 09:46.180
I apologize.

09:49.984 --> 09:53.187
Back to work. I know.

10:15.843 --> 10:17.077
Running planetary scans.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.486
<i>Sir, it looks like the intel
is good.</i>

10:24.487 --> 10:27.088
<i>The planet's laced
with naquadria deposits.</i>

10:27.089 --> 10:28.989
<i>We're also reading
a huge energy signature</i>

10:28.990 --> 10:30.724
<i>Emanating from what looks like
a pyramid.</i>

10:30.725 --> 10:31.759
Pyramid?

10:31.760 --> 10:33.493
That takes me back.

10:33.494 --> 10:34.962
Unfortunately,
the complex inside

10:34.963 --> 10:36.028
Is shielded
against beaming technology.

10:36.029 --> 10:38.065
<i>So Rush can't be beamed out.</i>

10:38.066 --> 10:39.734
No, sir,
we'll have to go in

10:39.735 --> 10:41.502
<i>with ground forces
from the outside.</i>

10:41.503 --> 10:43.103
All right, Colonel.

10:43.104 --> 10:44.371
You have a go.

11:00.288 --> 11:03.690
What was that?

11:03.691 --> 11:04.958
We're under attack.

11:04.959 --> 11:07.895
Can we dial the ninth chevron?

11:07.896 --> 11:09.329
Not without
blowing everything up.

11:10.365 --> 11:12.232
Dial it.

11:12.233 --> 11:14.133
Get ready!

11:14.134 --> 11:15.836
We're going now!

11:34.421 --> 11:36.490
<i>The Lucian alliance</i>

11:36.491 --> 11:37.925
<i>Is an organization of humans</i>

11:37.926 --> 11:39.726
<i>From a number
of sovereign planets</i>

11:39.727 --> 11:41.161
<i>Who have taken control</i>

11:41.162 --> 11:42.429
<i>Of the resources
and technology...</i>

11:45.867 --> 11:50.003
<i>Alliance is made up
of power-hungry...</i>

11:50.004 --> 11:52.773
<i>Violence as a means of
enforcing their dominion.</i>

11:52.774 --> 11:54.241
<i>Leadership...</i>

11:54.242 --> 11:55.743
The air force video?

11:55.744 --> 11:57.945
Yeah.

11:57.946 --> 11:59.413
I'm just seeing if
there's anything in here

11:59.414 --> 12:01.248
that might help.

12:01.249 --> 12:03.418
<i>Control a sizable army and
numerous ha'tak vessels,</i>

12:03.419 --> 12:06.253
<i>or former Goa'uld
motherships...</i>

12:06.254 --> 12:07.320
What's he going to do?

12:07.321 --> 12:09.056
The Colonel?

12:09.057 --> 12:13.360
They're sending an army.

12:13.361 --> 12:15.262
What do you think
he's going to do?

12:33.181 --> 12:34.448
This is it.

12:36.050 --> 12:37.517
It's happening now?

12:37.518 --> 12:38.786
Yeah.

12:46.995 --> 12:48.295
Go!

12:48.296 --> 12:51.131
Radio back
when you reach the other side.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.468
And take him
with you.

13:06.815 --> 13:08.916
Colonel Young.

13:09.951 --> 13:11.985
I see them, Eli.

13:11.986 --> 13:13.086
All personnel,

13:13.087 --> 13:14.855
report to your
designated areas.

13:14.856 --> 13:15.922
This is not a drill.

13:15.923 --> 13:17.591
Defense teams stand by.

13:17.592 --> 13:19.826
Copy that. Go, go!

13:29.538 --> 13:30.570
Which button?

13:30.571 --> 13:31.872
This one.

13:31.873 --> 13:32.906
How long will it take

13:32.907 --> 13:34.041
till we reach vacuum?

13:34.042 --> 13:35.275
A minute or so?

13:35.276 --> 13:36.877
That's about right.

13:43.618 --> 13:45.352
Colonel.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.225
Defense teams stand by to
secure prisoners on my order.

14:13.794 --> 14:15.895
Copy that.

14:19.934 --> 14:22.035
Monitor from here,
stay on the radio.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.537
Got it.

14:24.538 --> 14:27.040
What happened?

14:27.041 --> 14:29.042
Colonel?

14:29.043 --> 14:31.478
No, no, it's me.

14:31.479 --> 14:32.512
Rush?

14:32.513 --> 14:35.148
Yeah.

14:35.149 --> 14:37.717
The ship...
The Lucian alliance...

14:37.718 --> 14:39.652
Yeah, no, we know everything.

14:39.653 --> 14:40.887
Telford told us.

14:40.888 --> 14:42.522
So what are we doing
about it, then?

14:42.523 --> 14:44.758
Let's just say

14:44.759 --> 14:46.893
It'll all be over
in a few minutes.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.236
Get to your
quarters.

14:58.973 --> 15:00.540
Come on.

15:06.647 --> 15:08.582
Colonel, I'm reading
a huge energy spike.

15:08.583 --> 15:09.816
At this rate,
they've got less than a minute

15:09.817 --> 15:11.151
Before their core goes up.

15:11.152 --> 15:13.621
Get our people
out of the shielded areas

15:13.622 --> 15:16.190
And beam them back
to the ship, now!

15:21.562 --> 15:22.929
The core
is going to go critical.

15:22.930 --> 15:24.764
I can't stop it.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.534
Still no signal
from the other side?

15:30.805 --> 15:32.005
Get as many
of our people through

15:32.006 --> 15:33.239
As you can.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.654
Colonel, we still
have two 302s

15:47.655 --> 15:49.056
On their way back
from the planet.

15:51.926 --> 15:53.827
We can't wait.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.295
Get us out of here.

16:24.659 --> 16:26.960
Aren't we supposed to
go to our quarters?

16:26.961 --> 16:28.527
These are my quarters.

16:28.528 --> 16:30.663
And I'm not going anywhere.

16:37.838 --> 16:39.840
Colonel?

16:39.841 --> 16:41.741
They brought Rush
along with them.

16:41.742 --> 16:44.277
We're going to have to do this
the hard way.

16:57.958 --> 16:58.991
What did you do to the gate?

16:58.992 --> 17:00.360
It wasn't me.

17:00.361 --> 17:02.262
You killed over a hundred
of my men!

17:02.263 --> 17:03.830
It was Rush!

17:03.831 --> 17:04.964
Massin.

17:04.964 --> 17:07.165
Massin, your
father's name.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.367
It was my password.

17:08.368 --> 17:09.636
Gate travel must have
severed the link.

17:09.637 --> 17:10.670
It's me.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.239
Telford?

17:13.240 --> 17:16.643
<i>Lucian alliance forces,</i>

17:16.644 --> 17:18.678
<i>You are surrounded
and sealed in.</i>

17:18.679 --> 17:20.247
<i>You will also find</i>

17:20.248 --> 17:21.079
<i>The intel provided
by Colonel Telford</i>

17:21.080 --> 17:23.016
<i>Is now useless.</i>

17:23.017 --> 17:25.752
<i>Lay down your weapons
in front of the doors</i>

17:25.752 --> 17:27.787
<i>And step back
into the center of the room</i>

17:27.788 --> 17:30.056
<i>With your hands on your heads,</i>

17:30.057 --> 17:32.057
<i>Or we will vent
the entire compartment</i>

17:32.058 --> 17:33.093
<i>To space.</i>

17:33.094 --> 17:34.994
Can they do it?

17:34.995 --> 17:36.029
Yes.

17:36.030 --> 17:37.897
Then they should have.

17:59.386 --> 18:00.988
Colonel,
they're up to something.

18:00.989 --> 18:02.889
Talk to me.

18:02.890 --> 18:05.792
They've got something
to open the doors!

18:05.793 --> 18:08.027
Vent the atmosphere
in the gateroom, Brody.

18:08.028 --> 18:09.062
Do it now.

18:09.063 --> 18:10.095
<i>Too late.</i>

18:14.968 --> 18:16.703
Take cover!

18:19.673 --> 18:20.873
Get back!

18:26.380 --> 18:27.880
Go!

18:27.881 --> 18:29.282
Fall back!

18:36.358 --> 18:38.358
Rush, you should stay here.

18:38.359 --> 18:40.193
No, no.
The ship's under attack!

18:40.194 --> 18:41.861
Rush!

18:41.862 --> 18:43.296
Rush!

19:03.216 --> 19:04.784
Okay, Eli, it's time to go.

19:04.785 --> 19:05.817
No, just wait.

19:05.818 --> 19:06.854
No, Eli, let's go.

19:06.855 --> 19:07.887
Now!

19:08.989 --> 19:10.223
Yeah. Yeah.

19:18.298 --> 19:20.233
There's an elevator this way.

19:32.913 --> 19:34.313
Oh, God!

19:36.850 --> 19:39.385
Go!

19:55.736 --> 19:57.103
Rush!

19:57.104 --> 19:58.237
Wait!

20:09.450 --> 20:12.385
<i>You're welcome.</i>

20:12.386 --> 20:14.020
Want to get the hell
out of there now?

20:17.191 --> 20:20.327
Chloe, you've been shot.

20:20.328 --> 20:21.360
Sorry, sorry.

20:25.199 --> 20:26.766
See, it's okay.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.235
You'll be... You'll be okay.

20:29.236 --> 20:30.269
Eli...

20:30.270 --> 20:33.006
Uh... Okay.

20:41.248 --> 20:43.349
Hey, you'll be fine.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.452
You'll be fine, all right?

20:47.488 --> 20:49.989
Chloe...

20:51.291 --> 20:53.092
Oh, my God...

21:11.812 --> 21:13.312
I'll be right back.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.514
Okay?

21:28.295 --> 21:31.097
<i>Go through this way.
Let's go!</i>

21:32.865 --> 21:33.934
Over here.

21:41.442 --> 21:44.077
Colonel Young?

21:45.444 --> 21:47.446
Who is this?

21:47.447 --> 21:48.581
<i>Commander Kiva</i>

21:48.582 --> 21:51.618
<i>of the Lucian
alliance forces.</i>

21:51.619 --> 21:55.021
We will not be complying
with your request to surrender.

22:04.835 --> 22:06.169
<i>We barely made hyperspace.</i>

22:06.170 --> 22:07.803
<i>This time it was even closer.</i>

22:08.004 --> 22:10.472
What about casualties?

22:10.473 --> 22:12.841
Two of my 302s
couldn't make it back,

22:12.842 --> 22:15.277
<i>and if Rush was
still on the planet...</i>

22:15.278 --> 22:17.080
I'm sorry, Sam.

22:17.081 --> 22:18.615
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

22:18.616 --> 22:20.816
<i>Did any of them
make it to Destiny?</i>

22:20.817 --> 22:23.651
I haven't heard.

22:23.652 --> 22:25.554
<i>Hands behind your back.</i>

22:25.555 --> 22:26.589
<i>Do it!</i>

22:26.590 --> 22:27.656
<i>Okay!</i>

22:33.597 --> 22:35.030
So much for that.

22:37.235 --> 22:40.103
Why didn't you evacuate
the compartment to space?

22:40.104 --> 22:41.871
That was the plan.

22:41.872 --> 22:43.306
<i>He didn't do it to save you.</i>

22:43.307 --> 22:45.308
<i>Not me.</i>

22:45.309 --> 22:46.509
The connection
was severed

22:46.510 --> 22:48.211
the minute I stepped
through the gate.

22:52.883 --> 22:54.517
Give me the lay
of the land.

22:55.552 --> 22:57.253
This is the gateroom.

22:57.254 --> 22:59.188
They've also occupied
the surrounding corridors.

22:59.189 --> 23:01.357
They had advanced further,
but they pulled back.

23:01.358 --> 23:03.126
Just took
what they could hold

23:03.127 --> 23:04.927
With limited manpower.
That's smart.

23:04.928 --> 23:06.329
Once they retreated,

23:06.330 --> 23:08.030
I locked down
the area behind them.

23:08.031 --> 23:09.164
Given the technology
at their disposal,

23:09.165 --> 23:10.500
It won't stop them,

23:10.501 --> 23:11.968
But it should give us
some breathing room.

23:11.969 --> 23:14.537
The prisoners
are being held here.

23:14.538 --> 23:15.571
Between them and us,

23:15.572 --> 23:17.106
30 feet of corridor
either way.

23:17.107 --> 23:18.908
Well, the second we hit
the outside sections,

23:18.909 --> 23:22.044
Those hostages
are as good as dead.

23:22.045 --> 23:23.846
Colonel.

23:23.847 --> 23:25.114
Yeah?

23:25.115 --> 23:27.216
I've done a head count.

23:27.217 --> 23:30.419
We have 12 missing
and presumed captured,

23:30.420 --> 23:33.123
Including Riley, TJ,

23:33.124 --> 23:35.224
Eli, and Chloe.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.262
Come on!

23:39.263 --> 23:40.296
Eli?

23:41.865 --> 23:43.466
Hey.

23:43.467 --> 23:44.600
Hey.

23:45.870 --> 23:46.903
What happened?

23:46.904 --> 23:48.971
You were shot.

23:48.972 --> 23:51.374
I stopped the bleeding.

23:51.375 --> 23:52.642
No, you're fine.
Look up here.

23:52.643 --> 23:54.243
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

23:57.981 --> 24:01.084
Where are we?

24:02.619 --> 24:04.220
I don't know.

24:04.221 --> 24:05.321
I've never been

24:05.322 --> 24:07.323
To this part
of the ship before.

24:07.324 --> 24:09.192
I don't think anyone has.

24:09.193 --> 24:12.627
I just pressed
some random buttons.

24:12.628 --> 24:14.230
We can't get back.

24:14.231 --> 24:15.331
I'm guessing

24:15.332 --> 24:16.365
Someone locked out
elevator access.

24:16.366 --> 24:17.400
Us or them?

24:19.603 --> 24:21.103
Yeah...

24:21.104 --> 24:22.905
That's the problem.

24:27.244 --> 24:29.011
I just need to get to a window,

24:29.012 --> 24:31.614
Get an idea
of where we are,

24:31.615 --> 24:34.517
And... And then
we can walk back.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.187
Oh... Oh, no, no, no!

24:38.188 --> 24:39.522
I've got you.

24:39.523 --> 24:40.656
Come on.

24:40.657 --> 24:41.924
Come here.

24:41.925 --> 24:42.958
Ready? Here we go.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.927
One, two, three.

24:46.196 --> 24:48.029
Okay... Okay.

24:48.030 --> 24:49.199
Lean on me.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.266
Okay.

24:50.267 --> 24:51.267
I've got you. Ready?

24:51.268 --> 24:52.301
Yeah.

24:52.302 --> 24:54.137
Here you go.

24:55.705 --> 24:57.540
Colonel Young.

24:57.541 --> 24:59.609
Go ahead.

24:59.610 --> 25:02.144
<i>Here's how I see
the situation...</i>

25:02.145 --> 25:05.281
We have the gateroom
and some of your people,

25:05.282 --> 25:07.283
You hold
the control interface room

25:07.284 --> 25:10.019
Which, I'm told,
is the ship's nerve center.

25:10.020 --> 25:11.387
<i>What do you want?</i>

25:11.388 --> 25:14.957
We came here for the
same reasons you did.

25:14.958 --> 25:16.459
We don't want to hurt anyone.

25:16.460 --> 25:18.593
<i>You're welcome
to stay aboard Destiny</i>

25:18.594 --> 25:20.596
<i>And help us realize
the potential of her discovery.</i>

25:20.597 --> 25:23.665
<i>Lay down your weapons
and join us</i>

25:23.666 --> 25:24.701
Or, if you prefer,

25:24.702 --> 25:26.736
We can drop you off

25:26.737 --> 25:28.570
At the next inhabitable world
of your choosing.

25:28.571 --> 25:31.641
Or I vent the atmosphere
in the sections you're occupying

25:31.642 --> 25:34.477
<i>And keep the ship.</i>

25:34.478 --> 25:35.978
If you had that in you,
Colonel,

25:35.979 --> 25:37.580
You would have done it
already.

25:37.581 --> 25:39.148
The point is,
I have the ability

25:39.149 --> 25:41.217
To end this conversaon
right now.

25:43.020 --> 25:44.053
Sergeant?

25:44.054 --> 25:45.588
She wanted to see you, sir.

25:45.589 --> 25:47.391
Wouldn't shut up, in fact.

25:47.392 --> 25:49.425
As you were, Sergeant.

25:52.129 --> 25:53.962
We are way past the point

25:53.963 --> 25:55.631
of fighting our way
out of this situation.

25:55.632 --> 25:58.467
We need to negotiate
with these people.

25:58.468 --> 25:59.969
And I think I should be
the one to...

25:59.970 --> 26:01.569
Yeah, yeah.
No, I think you're right.

26:04.341 --> 26:05.541
Him.

26:05.542 --> 26:07.376
Him.

26:13.517 --> 26:14.684
And her.

26:24.393 --> 26:25.562
That's a mistake.

26:26.596 --> 26:28.197
It's a demonstration.

26:31.001 --> 26:32.435
All it will do
is force their hand.

26:38.075 --> 26:40.509
Do you want control of the ship
or not?

26:50.120 --> 26:51.654
They have
some of our people.

26:51.655 --> 26:53.055
But we have
some of theirs.

26:53.056 --> 26:54.090
So the first thing
we need to do

26:54.091 --> 26:56.026
Is suggest
an exchange.

26:56.027 --> 26:57.226
Do you think
they'll do it?

26:57.227 --> 27:00.529
No. But I think
it's worth a shot.

27:03.166 --> 27:05.434
This is
the control interface room.

27:05.435 --> 27:07.069
This is the gateroom.

27:07.070 --> 27:08.471
If we cut our way
through the wall here,

27:08.472 --> 27:09.505
We can flank them.

27:09.506 --> 27:10.706
I can lead a team...

27:10.707 --> 27:12.375
That will reduce our numbers here.

27:12.376 --> 27:13.409
We take the control
interface room,

27:13.410 --> 27:14.443
We won't
need them here.

27:14.444 --> 27:15.578
The ship
will be ours.

27:15.579 --> 27:17.612
These sections
are in red.

27:17.613 --> 27:19.315
That section of the corridor
is exposed to space.

27:19.316 --> 27:20.449
The ship's shield
will hold

27:20.450 --> 27:21.684
Long enough
for us to pass.

27:21.685 --> 27:22.717
We will slowly
vent atmosphere

27:22.718 --> 27:24.120
To space, yes,

27:24.121 --> 27:25.154
But we could seal
the corridor again

27:25.155 --> 27:27.256
After we've
taken the ship.

27:44.175 --> 27:45.673
Take six men.

27:45.674 --> 27:46.710
I'll need twice that...

27:46.711 --> 27:48.109
Six.

27:49.679 --> 27:51.681
And if anything goes wrong...

27:54.418 --> 27:57.119
These three die.

27:59.656 --> 28:01.490
Not her.

28:01.491 --> 28:02.792
She's a medic.

28:02.793 --> 28:04.260
We can use her in the event...

28:04.261 --> 28:06.429
<i>Commander Kiva.</i>

28:11.101 --> 28:12.735
Who is this?

28:12.736 --> 28:14.236
<i>My name is Camile Wray.</i>

28:14.237 --> 28:17.606
I am the civilian authority
aboard this ship.

28:17.607 --> 28:21.210
I'd like to act
as an intermediary

28:21.211 --> 28:24.213
<i>To resolve this issue
without further bloodshed.</i>

28:24.214 --> 28:27.783
<i>Colonel Young will not
transfer control of this ship</i>

28:27.784 --> 28:28.818
<i>To you.</i>

28:28.819 --> 28:30.186
And you will?

28:30.187 --> 28:31.620
No.

28:31.621 --> 28:35.391
But I will expedite
a prisoner exchange...

28:35.392 --> 28:37.526
Your people for ours.

28:37.527 --> 28:39.695
If I release my prisoners,

28:39.696 --> 28:42.765
Colonel Young will not hesitate
to vent this compartment.

28:42.766 --> 28:45.601
You have 12 of our people.

28:45.602 --> 28:46.836
We have only four of yours.

28:46.837 --> 28:48.704
I propose
an even trade,

28:48.705 --> 28:50.606
Four for four.

28:50.607 --> 28:52.141
<i>This way, you maintain
your advantage</i>

28:52.142 --> 28:55.277
<i>and gain some
much-needed manpower.</i>

28:57.481 --> 28:59.548
Colonel Young agrees with this?

28:59.549 --> 29:01.784
In our society,

29:01.785 --> 29:04.920
the military takes orders
from civilian leadership.

29:13.697 --> 29:15.465
I'll consider it.

29:15.466 --> 29:18.300
Nice job.

29:18.301 --> 29:20.136
That should buy us some time.

29:20.137 --> 29:22.671
Look, you're trying
to save lives here.

29:22.672 --> 29:24.539
Obviously that's
a good thing.

29:24.540 --> 29:27.743
But even if she agrees
to the four, which is doubtful,

29:27.744 --> 29:28.777
She won't go any farther
than that.

29:28.778 --> 29:30.179
Once the equation tips

29:30.180 --> 29:32.481
To the point
of acceptable losses...

29:32.482 --> 29:34.150
Be
no acceptable losses...

29:34.151 --> 29:35.351
Colonel Young has
already determined

29:35.352 --> 29:36.919
What that number is.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.454
He knows

29:38.455 --> 29:39.488
The chances of us winning
without loss of life

29:39.489 --> 29:40.923
Are practically nil.

29:40.924 --> 29:43.393
So limit our losses,
yes, all that we can,

29:43.394 --> 29:44.759
But eventually,
you'll have to do something...

29:44.760 --> 29:46.595
You don't know
what you're talking about.

29:46.596 --> 29:48.431
I've recently been one of
your acceptable losses...

29:48.432 --> 29:49.797
You knew
what you were getting into...

29:49.798 --> 29:51.467
You should have disconnected
the stones

29:51.468 --> 29:53.035
And got me out!

29:53.036 --> 29:54.336
You have no clue what
you're talking about!

29:54.337 --> 29:55.538
Stop this now, please!

29:56.573 --> 29:57.840
I am going to save

29:57.841 --> 29:59.908
every one of those hostages,

29:59.909 --> 30:02.211
and I'm going to
retake this ship.

30:02.212 --> 30:03.513
Do you understand me?

30:04.848 --> 30:06.415
All right, Telford
has convinced her

30:06.416 --> 30:08.284
that he is still with them,

30:08.285 --> 30:09.818
otherwise he would
be dead by now.

30:09.819 --> 30:12.687
Sooner or later he
will make his move.

30:14.191 --> 30:19.828
So... We are to
gamble this ship

30:19.829 --> 30:21.664
and all of our lives

30:21.665 --> 30:24.266
in the hope that some traitor

30:24.267 --> 30:26.369
has had a change of heart.

30:36.241 --> 30:37.941
Look at that.

30:48.085 --> 30:49.019
I guess those elevators

30:49.020 --> 30:51.555
go more than just
up and down.

30:51.556 --> 30:52.956
Come on.

30:56.027 --> 30:57.427
Right there.

30:57.428 --> 30:58.462
You good?

30:58.463 --> 30:59.963
Yeah.

31:03.400 --> 31:06.570
I must have hit a few buttons
I wasn't supposed to press.

31:09.608 --> 31:12.643
Is the air getting thin?

31:12.644 --> 31:15.746
Life support isn't working
out here.

31:15.747 --> 31:17.848
How do you know?

31:17.849 --> 31:20.083
I was the one
who shut it off.

31:21.419 --> 31:23.520
Rush's orders.

31:23.521 --> 31:24.822
I mean, there's air.

31:24.823 --> 31:27.558
There isn't any new
air being pumped in.

31:27.559 --> 31:29.993
So we need
to keep moving.

31:29.994 --> 31:31.028
Yeah.

31:33.631 --> 31:34.665
Okay?

31:34.666 --> 31:36.900
I don't know if I can.

31:44.475 --> 31:46.710
No problem.

31:46.711 --> 31:48.712
I got you.

31:54.419 --> 31:57.487
This is my Lieutenant, varro.

31:57.488 --> 31:59.856
Save him.

32:08.132 --> 32:09.900
He's badly wounded.

32:12.003 --> 32:14.571
At even the slightest hint
of trouble, Lieutenant...

32:14.572 --> 32:17.174
I'll bring you
back, sir.

32:27.552 --> 32:29.753
I need to speak
to general O'Neill.

32:29.754 --> 32:31.588
Second-guessing a decision

32:31.589 --> 32:32.923
Is a waste of time.

32:32.924 --> 32:35.158
I'm not there.

32:35.159 --> 32:37.995
But I'm starting to wonder
if maybe I should be.

32:37.996 --> 32:39.829
I can't speak to that, sir.

32:39.830 --> 32:41.698
This should be done, Colonel.
Over.

32:41.699 --> 32:43.234
Yes, sir.

32:43.235 --> 32:45.202
At the time, I believed
that venting the gateroom

32:45.203 --> 32:46.503
Would kill both Dr. Rush

32:46.504 --> 32:48.839
And Colonel Telford.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.774
They deserved a chance...

32:50.775 --> 32:54.544
We lost two 302 pilots
sent to stop the attack.

32:54.545 --> 32:55.779
I'm sorry.

32:55.780 --> 32:56.913
Colonel carter knew
she'd lose her ship

32:56.914 --> 32:58.583
If she tried to save them,

32:58.584 --> 33:00.884
But it was the right decision.

33:00.885 --> 33:03.220
Yes, sir.

33:06.658 --> 33:09.526
Are you up for this, everett?

33:09.527 --> 33:11.995
Yes, sir.

33:11.996 --> 33:13.096
Because somebody
will take your place

33:13.097 --> 33:14.798
If you're not.

33:14.799 --> 33:17.067
I'm not going to let anybody
take that ship, sir.

33:17.068 --> 33:19.903
Then get your ass back there.

33:41.259 --> 33:43.092
We're good.

34:07.685 --> 34:10.020
What are you doing?

34:10.021 --> 34:12.056
Just checking to make sure
we're headed

34:12.056 --> 34:13.889
In the right direction.

34:19.297 --> 34:21.130
This way.

34:26.070 --> 34:28.704
There's no countdown.

34:28.705 --> 34:30.607
What?

34:30.608 --> 34:33.143
We dropped out of ftl
because someone was gating in.

34:33.143 --> 34:34.710
Why haven't we jumped back?

34:35.813 --> 34:37.147
Someone just
activated a console

34:37.148 --> 34:38.547
In one of
the access corridors.

34:45.056 --> 34:46.656
Colonel, a console
just came on

34:46.657 --> 34:48.125
<i>Using Telford's code.</i>

34:48.126 --> 34:49.693
There's a cordoned-off
section coming our way.

34:49.694 --> 34:51.828
That's his move.

34:55.666 --> 34:57.100
It's cold.

34:57.101 --> 34:58.135
Really?

35:04.609 --> 35:06.576
Okay...

35:11.983 --> 35:15.585
We have to be careful
moving through sections.

35:15.586 --> 35:17.821
There's a reason we've
never been out this far...

35:17.822 --> 35:22.024
A ton of compartments
are de-pressurized.

35:22.025 --> 35:23.627
Okay?

35:23.628 --> 35:24.728
Thank you.

35:24.729 --> 35:25.862
Hang on.

35:25.863 --> 35:28.031
Okay...

35:28.032 --> 35:29.065
Ready?

35:29.066 --> 35:30.901
Yeah.

35:30.902 --> 35:33.171
Okay.

35:44.982 --> 35:47.684
More dark and gloomy.

35:47.685 --> 35:49.019
We're good.

35:52.389 --> 35:54.624
Gotcha.

35:55.760 --> 35:56.793
How are you doing?

35:56.794 --> 35:57.828
I'm doing good.

35:57.829 --> 35:58.862
You sure?

36:12.043 --> 36:13.910
Stand by.

36:13.911 --> 36:15.145
Yes, sir, we're good to go.

36:15.146 --> 36:17.347
Ready.

36:17.348 --> 36:20.282
Just give the word, sir.

36:20.283 --> 36:22.052
It's locked down.

36:22.053 --> 36:23.253
I'll handle it.

36:38.101 --> 36:39.736
Okay, get ready.

37:10.446 --> 37:11.613
What was that?

37:32.469 --> 37:34.068
Ready.

37:40.409 --> 37:42.611
What happened?

37:42.612 --> 37:44.178
You didn't do that?

37:44.179 --> 37:45.480
What is that?

37:45.481 --> 37:48.182
Just a minute ago
it was a man.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.752
You need to stand down
till we figure this out.

37:55.225 --> 37:56.790
<i>This is Young.</i>

37:56.792 --> 37:58.259
<i>Everybody stand down.</i>

38:03.499 --> 38:05.334
Throw me a radio.

38:05.335 --> 38:07.201
Radio?

38:10.272 --> 38:12.340
Three clicks,
go to channel six.

38:12.341 --> 38:14.474
We're going to
have to try this again.

38:29.590 --> 38:31.292
Let's stop.

38:31.293 --> 38:32.760
I'm fine.

38:32.761 --> 38:34.195
Eli, you don't...

38:34.196 --> 38:37.264
Seriously,
this is nothing.

38:39.535 --> 38:42.937
Once, I climbed the
redridge mountains

38:42.938 --> 38:46.407
On my way to stonard
with a full pack.

38:46.408 --> 38:47.441
Where's that?

38:50.713 --> 38:53.214
The world
of warcraft.

38:54.249 --> 38:55.950
That must've given you

38:55.951 --> 38:57.551
Quite the sense
of accomplishment.

38:59.822 --> 39:00.855
Eli...

39:00.856 --> 39:02.290
Okay, okay...

39:02.291 --> 39:03.324
Okay, a little break,
a little break.

39:03.325 --> 39:04.359
Yeah.

39:05.661 --> 39:07.795
All right, all right.

39:16.272 --> 39:17.972
So what do you
think is happening?

39:17.973 --> 39:20.775
We've probably won by now.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.577
You think so?

39:25.214 --> 39:27.215
If we won,

39:27.216 --> 39:28.916
Then why haven't we
been rescued?

39:30.352 --> 39:33.454
Well, first,

39:33.455 --> 39:36.224
They have to figure out
what to do with the prisoners...

39:36.225 --> 39:37.759
And then

39:37.760 --> 39:41.663
There's that whole
post-victory celebration.

39:41.664 --> 39:43.364
I mean, streamers everywhere.

39:43.365 --> 39:44.899
I'm so tired.

39:48.003 --> 39:52.907
You're still...
You're still losing blood.

39:52.908 --> 39:54.575
I wasn't able to
stop it completely.

39:54.576 --> 39:55.743
Eli...

39:55.744 --> 39:57.612
Hey.

39:59.648 --> 40:02.617
I'm going
to take care of you.

40:14.363 --> 40:16.597
It wasn't them. I don't know
what happened to our man.

40:16.598 --> 40:18.366
But I know they had
nothing to do with it.

40:18.367 --> 40:20.635
They don't have anything
that could do that to a person.

40:20.636 --> 40:21.803
Are you telling me

40:21.804 --> 40:23.271
They had nothing to do
with this?

40:25.641 --> 40:27.542
What happened?

40:27.543 --> 40:28.742
Overload in
the power relays

40:28.743 --> 40:29.912
Proceeded by
temporary disruption

40:29.913 --> 40:31.546
Of all shipboard systems,

40:31.547 --> 40:32.680
Lights
to life support.

40:32.681 --> 40:33.648
How the hell
d they manage that?

40:33.649 --> 40:35.316
They didn't.

40:35.317 --> 40:36.584
Well, then, what caused it?

40:36.585 --> 40:38.252
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

40:38.253 --> 40:39.520
They're making their move.

40:39.521 --> 40:41.322
It wouldn't be
that obvious.

40:41.323 --> 40:43.357
<i>Colonel Young.</i>

40:43.358 --> 40:44.859
<i>Would you care to tell me
what's going on?</i>

40:44.860 --> 40:46.861
We don't know.

40:46.862 --> 40:49.196
One of my men is dead.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.631
You need to know

40:50.632 --> 40:52.734
That we had nothing
to do with that.

40:52.735 --> 40:54.335
<i>Yes, so I'm told.</i>

40:57.439 --> 41:00.409
I'm going to ask for
a show of good faith.

41:00.410 --> 41:02.878
<i>What do you want?</i>

41:11.687 --> 41:12.854
Colonel?

41:18.861 --> 41:20.562
Lieutenant.

41:21.730 --> 41:23.764
How are you?

41:23.765 --> 41:26.567
I'm fine.

41:26.568 --> 41:29.303
We're all fine.

41:30.873 --> 41:32.640
What is it that they want?

41:32.641 --> 41:35.343
<i>Some of their people
are injured badly.</i>

41:35.344 --> 41:36.644
I'm going to need
medical supplies

41:36.645 --> 41:38.313
to help them.

41:46.522 --> 41:47.955
What will this accomplish?

41:47.956 --> 41:49.323
A goodwill gesture

41:49.324 --> 41:50.758
doesn't have to
accomplish anything.

41:50.759 --> 41:52.393
Of course it does!

41:52.394 --> 41:53.794
So they lack
medical supplies.

41:53.795 --> 41:55.863
Who knows what else
they might lack?

41:55.864 --> 41:57.298
Food? Water?

41:57.299 --> 41:58.399
They'll get desperate,
make their move,

41:58.400 --> 41:59.901
and when they do,

41:59.902 --> 42:00.968
they'll be dealing
with the hostages first.

42:00.969 --> 42:03.371
There's only one way
this is going to end

42:03.372 --> 42:04.372
if we wait.

42:04.373 --> 42:05.806
How do you know that?

42:05.807 --> 42:07.875
We don't even know what's
going on with the ship!

42:07.876 --> 42:09.577
All the more reason
to act now.

42:12.481 --> 42:14.215
Rush is right.

42:14.216 --> 42:15.850
We have to take them down,

42:15.851 --> 42:17.485
and we have to
do it right now.
