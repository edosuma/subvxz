WEBVTT

00:04.521 --> 00:07.730
I think I did pretty
well on that French test.

00:07.731 --> 00:10.731
It was a math test.

00:11.298 --> 00:13.744
- Ay, dios mio!
- That's Spanish.

00:13.745 --> 00:17.883
Oh. Well, then I did
very badly either way.

00:17.884 --> 00:20.718
Don't worry, Fletcher. We're
never going to need all this math.

00:20.719 --> 00:23.005
Yet everyone always tells
you how important it is.

00:23.006 --> 00:27.097
In fact, if I had a nickel for
every time I've heard it, I'd have...

00:27.098 --> 00:29.021
I'd have...

00:29.022 --> 00:31.482
Some nickels.

00:33.138 --> 00:34.802
Ow!

00:34.803 --> 00:36.366
Ha-ha!

00:36.367 --> 00:39.269
First victim of my holographic chair.

00:39.270 --> 00:43.307
Angus! That was incredibly mean!
Why would you do that to me?

00:43.308 --> 00:45.651
It was meant for Fletcher.

00:45.652 --> 00:48.232
Oh. Okay then.

00:50.147 --> 00:55.051
Well, I don't understand. Our
A.N.T. Pads can't project 3D images.

00:55.052 --> 00:56.320
Mine can.

00:56.321 --> 01:01.124
I accessed the manufacturer's secure server
and downloaded an experimental beta update.

01:01.125 --> 01:04.706
I'd be happy to tell you
more of the details, Fletcher.

01:04.708 --> 01:08.298
While you relax in this
completely real lounge chair.

01:08.299 --> 01:10.477
No way. I'm not falling for that.

01:10.478 --> 01:12.998
Suit yourself.

01:15.580 --> 01:17.380
Ah.

01:18.853 --> 01:22.352
Chyna: Wait. You broke
into the Z-Tech servers?

01:22.353 --> 01:25.148
They're a huge, powerful
technology company!

01:25.149 --> 01:27.055
Aren't you worried
about getting in trouble?

01:27.056 --> 01:32.832
Nope. There is absolutely no
way they can trace it back to me.

01:32.833 --> 01:34.993
(Screams)

01:35.125 --> 01:39.262
Because I used Fletcher's
computer to do it. (Laughs)

01:39.263 --> 01:41.063
Oh.

01:41.094 --> 01:43.061
Okay then. (Giggles)

01:43.062 --> 01:46.304

Do you not speak English?

02:39.207 --> 02:41.008
I'll say it in Spanish.

02:41.009 --> 02:44.549
"X" plus three equals seven!

02:46.014 --> 02:49.254
Ah! He's got a weapon!

02:49.385 --> 02:50.455
(Beeping)

02:50.456 --> 02:54.221
I am the great and powerful Grundy!

02:54.222 --> 02:56.056
(All screaming)

02:56.057 --> 02:58.977
I created this new voice modulation
app that makes your voice sound...

02:58.978 --> 03:02.897
(In deep voice) Scary and awesome!

03:02.898 --> 03:04.298
You're Zoltan Grundy!

03:04.299 --> 03:06.720
I read your book about
how you founded Z-Tech,

03:06.721 --> 03:09.937
and built it into the world's
largest technology company.

03:09.938 --> 03:11.433
(In normal voice) You liked my book?

03:11.434 --> 03:14.435
I said I read your book.

03:14.436 --> 03:17.419
Mr. Grundy, I'm a huge fan.

03:17.420 --> 03:22.625
I have your cell phone, your laptop,
your desktop, your MP3 player,

03:22.626 --> 03:27.973
your tablet, your mini-tablet,
and your jumbo mini-tablet.

03:27.974 --> 03:31.533
Wow. You have a really
good marketing department.

03:31.534 --> 03:33.396
Zoltan: If you like
the jumbo mini-tablet,

03:33.397 --> 03:36.205
you'll love the mega
nano jumbo mini-tablet.

03:36.206 --> 03:40.586
It's huge, while also being quite tiny.

03:41.578 --> 03:43.558
Now...

03:43.653 --> 03:48.017
(In deep voice) Where is the villainous
cyber-crook responsible for the break-in?

03:48.018 --> 03:50.385
It was him! He framed
me! He used my computer!

03:50.386 --> 03:52.306
What?

03:52.455 --> 03:55.138
(In normal voice) You're
telling me some kid,

03:55.139 --> 03:58.967
breached our network, bypassed
our intrusion detection algorithms,

03:58.968 --> 04:04.199
and somehow figured out the
answer to my security question?

04:04.200 --> 04:09.480
I mean, how did he know
the name of my first pet?

04:10.107 --> 04:14.127
I miss Password. Such a great dog.

04:14.310 --> 04:16.211
So, what are you going to do to me?

04:16.212 --> 04:19.045
Well, I'd like to start...

04:19.046 --> 04:20.935
By shaking your hand.

04:20.937 --> 04:23.965
But I can't, because
I'm on my private jet.

04:23.966 --> 04:25.387
I'm not flying anywhere.

04:25.388 --> 04:27.489
It's just very comfortable.

04:27.490 --> 04:30.259
So, what are you?

04:30.260 --> 04:31.751
Some sort of child prodigy?

04:31.752 --> 04:33.803
Well, everyone in the
A.N.T. Program is a prodigy.

04:33.804 --> 04:36.983
I'm a musician, Fletcher's an
artist, Olive has an eidetic memory,

04:36.984 --> 04:40.469
and that kid rides a stationary bike!

04:40.470 --> 04:43.438
You're in a special
program for child prodigies?

04:43.439 --> 04:45.174
I was a child prodigy!

04:45.175 --> 04:49.545
Yes, we know. Some of us
labored through your book.

04:49.546 --> 04:53.582
I've got to meet you guys in person
and learn all about this A.N.T. Program.

04:53.583 --> 04:55.203
I'm on my way.

04:55.204 --> 04:59.046
(In deep voice) Commandos, fall back!

04:59.047 --> 05:03.067
(In normal voice) I love this app!

05:06.926 --> 05:08.966
Whew. That was close.

05:08.967 --> 05:11.187
(Chuckles)

05:11.849 --> 05:13.649
Ha!

05:19.309 --> 05:21.583
Zoltan Grundy is coming here? (Gasps)

05:21.584 --> 05:23.345
Do you know how much he's worth?

05:23.346 --> 05:26.898
Well, every human has an immeasurable,
intrinsic worth, so you can't really...

05:26.899 --> 05:29.299
$62 billion!

05:30.453 --> 05:34.190
Yeah, so we figured you'd want
to roll out the red carpet.

05:34.191 --> 05:38.293
Or at least hit on him in a
sloppy and embarrassing way.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.462
This is a huge opportunity!

05:40.463 --> 05:44.433
Grundy gives millions of
dollars to all sorts of causes.

05:44.434 --> 05:48.370
Maybe he'll sponsor the
A.N.T. Program! (Gasps)

05:48.371 --> 05:50.505
Think what we could use that money for!

05:50.506 --> 05:52.507
- New equipment.
- Teacher training.

05:52.508 --> 05:54.847
A Principal who doesn't hate children!

05:54.848 --> 05:57.068
What! No.

05:58.115 --> 06:00.705
I can finally get a
Koi Pond for my office.

06:00.706 --> 06:05.354
Right now the Koi just flop
around and die on the carpet.

06:05.355 --> 06:08.224
Well, Mr. Grundy will be here soon.
We'd better get this place in shape.

06:08.225 --> 06:11.160
Mmm. Way ahead of you.

06:11.161 --> 06:13.081
What!

06:13.263 --> 06:15.530
What are you doing?

06:15.531 --> 06:19.945
We need to make everything
here look old and run-down.

06:19.946 --> 06:22.226
Like this?

06:27.110 --> 06:33.010
And here is the shining jewel
of Webster High, the Ant Farm.

06:38.221 --> 06:40.389
(Playing minor chord)

06:40.390 --> 06:42.158
Wow.

06:42.159 --> 06:44.292
Like many of the women
my mother sets me up with,

06:44.293 --> 06:48.397
this place looks much worse in person.

06:48.398 --> 06:50.927
I can't believe a
handsome man like you would

06:50.928 --> 06:54.469
need someone to fix him up with women.

06:54.470 --> 06:58.370
Sloppy, check. Embarrassing, check.

06:59.342 --> 07:02.916
How can we be expected to learn
in an environment like this?

07:02.917 --> 07:08.817
Crumbling infrastructure, ancient
equipment, dead fish all over the carpets.

07:09.812 --> 07:15.357
To say nothing of the filth and
disgusting food in the cafeteria.

07:15.358 --> 07:19.228
We didn't do anything to the cafeteria.

07:19.229 --> 07:22.307
If only there were some way to,

07:22.308 --> 07:25.754
improve the situation of us
poor, unfortunate prodigies.

07:25.755 --> 07:28.913
With whom you have a
deep personal connection.

07:28.914 --> 07:30.172
There is.

07:30.173 --> 07:34.171
I am going to make the education of
these gifted children my highest priority.

07:34.172 --> 07:35.005
Yes!

07:35.006 --> 07:38.513
I will spare no expense making sure
they have everything they need to thrive.

07:38.514 --> 07:39.441
Yes!

07:39.442 --> 07:41.585
By building a new, improved school,

07:41.586 --> 07:45.221
and taking these prodigies
away from Webster High forever!

07:45.222 --> 07:47.489
Yes! Take them!

07:47.490 --> 07:50.070
Take them all!

07:55.683 --> 08:00.543
Someone has to rescue these
gifted children from this eyesore!

08:00.544 --> 08:05.206
Hey! Principal Skidmore may be
an eyesore, but she has feelings!

08:05.207 --> 08:06.806
(Whispers) You have feelings, right?

08:06.807 --> 08:08.887
(Growls)

08:08.888 --> 08:12.481
There's no way that you're taking
these prodigies away from me.

08:12.482 --> 08:14.283
They are extremely loyal.

08:14.284 --> 08:16.252
Where did you say we
could get an application?

08:16.253 --> 08:18.287
You know what? I'll just
give you my information.

08:18.288 --> 08:21.708
- Hold still, Susan.
- Oh!

08:27.463 --> 08:31.333
Hey, Olive! I wrote a song for my
audition for Mr. Grundy's new school.

08:31.334 --> 08:33.369
It's called Stars Aligning.

08:33.370 --> 08:37.229
And, yes, I know that stars are fixed
points in space and can't actually align,

08:37.230 --> 08:39.408
but it's a song, so cut
me some slack, Olive!

08:39.409 --> 08:43.245
Interesting factoid. You actually
don't cut slack, you release it.

08:43.246 --> 08:47.283
It's a nautical term dating
back to 17th century England.

08:47.284 --> 08:51.185
Wow. For your audition, you should
definitely not tell that story!

08:51.186 --> 08:52.189
(Scoffs)

08:52.190 --> 08:57.192
I would never do that. Gosh,
Chyna, release me some slack.

08:57.193 --> 08:59.128
Besides, I'm not gonna audition.

08:59.129 --> 09:01.766
I can't go to another
school. I love it here!

09:01.767 --> 09:04.642
You hate it here! You
complain about everything.

09:04.643 --> 09:07.636
Last week, you complained that
they didn't have a complaint box.

09:07.637 --> 09:11.340
And then when they put it in, you
complained that it was too boxy.

09:11.341 --> 09:14.082
Because I love complaining.

09:14.083 --> 09:17.212
Besides, I can't leave
Webster. I'm needed here.

09:17.213 --> 09:19.973
You are? By who?

09:20.283 --> 09:24.320
I've never told anyone this, but...

09:24.321 --> 09:26.255
I am Wacky.

09:26.256 --> 09:29.559
You're not Wacky. In fact, I've
seen you in the same room as him.

09:29.560 --> 09:33.760
Uh, nope. Couldn't happen. Impossible.

09:34.040 --> 09:39.005
I'll prove to you that I'm
Wacky. Check out my wolf moves.

09:39.006 --> 09:43.941
See? I am marking my territory
by releasing my own scent.

09:43.942 --> 09:48.444
Okay, I take that back.
You definitely are Wacky.

09:48.445 --> 09:52.381
Olive. What's going on?
Why don't you wanna go?

09:52.382 --> 09:54.383
Chyna, it's a boarding school.

09:54.384 --> 09:55.785
Do you know what that means?

09:55.786 --> 09:58.749
A boarding school is an educational
institution where children go to study

09:58.750 --> 10:01.075
and live away from their parents
with their fellow students

10:01.076 --> 10:03.410
and possibly teachers
and/or administrators.

10:03.411 --> 10:05.495
The next time you say, "do
you know what that means?"

10:05.496 --> 10:07.975
Please give me a chance to say, "yes".

10:07.976 --> 10:10.414
I can't live miles away from home.

10:10.415 --> 10:14.203
I'm scared to go to this school,
and I live across the street.

10:14.204 --> 10:18.374
Olive, (Laughs) There'll be no reason to
be scared, because I'll be there with you!

10:18.375 --> 10:21.825
To support you. And think
about how much fun we'd have.

10:21.826 --> 10:23.412
We can be roommates!

10:23.413 --> 10:26.162
Now that you mention
it, if we were roommates,

10:26.163 --> 10:30.352
I'm sure I'd have a whole new
bunch of things to complain about.

10:30.353 --> 10:33.293
All right, I'm in!

10:34.457 --> 10:36.358
What are you doing?

10:36.359 --> 10:40.429
Marking my territory. I don't
want people near my locker.

10:40.430 --> 10:43.010
Roommates, huh?

10:44.567 --> 10:46.502
To prove that I deserve
to go to your school,

10:46.503 --> 10:51.140
I have recreated a famous painting
using only car windshield dust.

10:51.141 --> 10:53.409
Edvard Munch's The Scream.

10:53.410 --> 10:54.985
Or as I like to call it...

10:54.986 --> 10:59.415
"What my dad looked like when I
told him I wanted to be an artist".

10:59.416 --> 11:01.017
Very impressive.

11:01.018 --> 11:03.851
Plus it's a great way to re-purpose
old abandoned rust buckets,

11:03.852 --> 11:05.220
that no one would otherwise want.

11:05.221 --> 11:08.281
Hey, there's my car!

11:10.260 --> 11:16.140
Why did you draw a picture of
your father on my windshield?

11:16.578 --> 11:19.971
For my audition, I will
demonstrate my eidetic memory.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.666
Name any page from any book and
I'll recite the text verbatim.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.907
My autobiography, page...

11:27.162 --> 11:28.962
47.

11:29.379 --> 11:32.247
(In British accent) "I've always
been rather fond of sherbet".

11:32.248 --> 11:35.720
"My favorite of all the sherbet
flavors is indubitably rainbow".

11:35.721 --> 11:41.190
"But if forced to select a single
flavor, I would have to lean toward"...

11:41.191 --> 11:44.193
- Why are you stopping?
- That's as far as I could get.

11:44.194 --> 11:48.634
After that, I threw it in the fireplace.

11:49.532 --> 11:51.300
Wow.

11:51.301 --> 11:57.201
For the last two years, you've been
generating the power for the entire school?

12:07.150 --> 12:11.520
I'm the most gifted computer
science prodigy in the country.

12:11.521 --> 12:13.950
You should be auditioning for me.

12:13.951 --> 12:14.932
(Scoffs)

12:14.933 --> 12:17.392
- No.
- Okay.

12:17.393 --> 12:21.413
- Next, please.
- Wait, wait, wait.

12:29.305 --> 12:31.206
Thank you!

12:31.207 --> 12:33.242
We'll be in touch.

12:33.243 --> 12:35.163
Next!

12:36.974 --> 12:40.516
For my audition, I am going
to sing a song that I wrote.

12:40.517 --> 12:42.982
<i>♪Breaking all the boundaries tonight.</i>

Oh. I can feel a smash hit coming.

13:11.857 --> 13:14.317
(Car honking)

13:20.290 --> 13:24.459
A double cheeseburger, onion
rings, and a large orange drink.

13:24.460 --> 13:27.941
Wait, this isn't a drive-through.

13:27.942 --> 13:30.282
It is now.

13:35.305 --> 13:39.541
All right, the admission e-mails
should be arriving... now.

13:39.542 --> 13:41.376
(Cell phones chiming)

13:41.377 --> 13:44.413
Oh. Okay, let's all open
them at the same time.

13:44.414 --> 13:46.028
On three. One...

13:46.029 --> 13:48.217
I got in!

13:48.218 --> 13:50.252
Me, too! Of course.

13:50.253 --> 13:53.973
- Woo hoo!
- Wait. This school is supposed to be free.

13:53.974 --> 13:56.873
Why am I being charged a cleaning fee?

13:56.874 --> 14:00.414
Your reputation precedes you.

14:01.313 --> 14:04.133
I didn't get in?

14:04.267 --> 14:06.368
What's the matter, roomie?

14:06.369 --> 14:08.751
Uh, nothing.

14:08.752 --> 14:13.375
I'm just really bummed because I'm
really going to miss Principal Skidmore.

14:13.376 --> 14:16.097
So, you're all leaving?
Well, good riddance!

14:16.098 --> 14:20.412
I never liked any of you!
See you in my nightmares!

14:20.413 --> 14:24.673
Yeah, I can see why you'd miss that.

14:25.154 --> 14:28.034
(Indistinct talking)

14:33.551 --> 14:36.353
Is this Z-Tech customer support?

14:36.354 --> 14:39.122
Good. I think there was a mistake.

14:39.123 --> 14:42.426
I didn't get into your
new boarding school.

14:42.427 --> 14:47.330
Well, I don't see how removing my
phone battery is going to fix that.

14:47.331 --> 14:51.785
You know what? I'd like to
speak to your supervisor.

14:51.786 --> 14:56.373
Yes. I didn't get into
your new boarding school.

14:56.374 --> 15:00.444
For customer support, you're
not very supportive, Larry.

15:00.445 --> 15:04.825
I'd like to speak with your supervisor.

15:05.417 --> 15:08.251
Supervisor, please.
(Sighs) (Clock ticking)

15:08.252 --> 15:10.454
Supervisor, please.

15:10.455 --> 15:12.523
Supervisor, please.

15:12.524 --> 15:14.942
Supervisor, please.

15:14.943 --> 15:15.766
(Sighs)

15:15.767 --> 15:18.529
Supervisor, please.

15:18.530 --> 15:20.431
Supervisor, please.

15:20.432 --> 15:23.266
Zoltan: Customer support.
How can I help you?

15:23.267 --> 15:26.336
Mr. Grundy? This is Chyna Parks.

15:26.337 --> 15:30.474
Look, I know you're probably in some
important business meeting right now.

15:30.475 --> 15:34.315
Yes. That's exactly where I am.

15:34.512 --> 15:37.347
Well, I just wanted to talk to
you about the e-mail you sent.

15:37.348 --> 15:39.215
I was hoping it was a mistake.

15:39.216 --> 15:40.507
It t'wasn't.

15:40.508 --> 15:42.956
The only mistake here was
agreeing to cover customer service,

15:42.957 --> 15:46.801
while Cindy goes off to have her baby.

15:46.802 --> 15:50.062
Please, Mr. Grundy! I have
to get into your school!

15:50.063 --> 15:53.530
It's an amazing opportunity.
And all my friends are going!

15:53.531 --> 15:56.533
And Olive won't survive without me!

15:56.534 --> 15:59.402
I'm sorry, Chyna, I chose
a different musical prodigy.

15:59.403 --> 16:03.440
Now I have to go. I'm
up to my neck in bubbles.

16:03.441 --> 16:06.441
I mean, spreadsheets.

16:07.927 --> 16:09.787
Ugh!

16:10.079 --> 16:12.182
A different musical prodigy?

16:12.183 --> 16:13.216
Who?

16:13.217 --> 16:16.319
Yes! I got in! I got in!

16:16.320 --> 16:18.489
You got into what?

16:18.490 --> 16:20.890
These boots!

16:21.897 --> 16:26.217
Oh, and Zoltan Grundy's prodigy school.

16:26.364 --> 16:29.432
- You auditioned?
- Of course I did.

16:29.433 --> 16:33.269
Mr. Grundy practically begged me to.

16:33.270 --> 16:36.624
I know I'm not an A.N.T., but
please let me audition. I beg you.

16:36.625 --> 16:41.211
I'm way more gifted than any of
those weird, awkward prodigy freaks.

16:41.212 --> 16:45.031
I was one of those weird,
awkward prodigy freaks.

16:45.032 --> 16:47.132
I know!

16:48.025 --> 16:51.045
Anyway, for my audition,
I'm going to be singing...

16:51.046 --> 16:56.946
A much-improved cover of a song
by a homely, untalented girl.

17:29.991 --> 17:31.127
Wait.

17:31.128 --> 17:34.431
Why did you tell me the part of the story
that proves you begged him to audition?

17:34.432 --> 17:37.972
I like talking about myself.

17:38.187 --> 17:41.271
Anyway, the point is,
of course I got in.

17:41.272 --> 17:46.852
I've always told you I'm
just as talented as you are.

17:46.909 --> 17:48.943
Why are you taking the
battery out of your phone?

17:48.944 --> 17:52.904
At this point, I'll try anything.

17:57.252 --> 17:59.661
I'm so glad you talked me into this!

17:59.662 --> 18:02.203
Boarding school is
going to be so awesome!

18:02.204 --> 18:03.810
I know we'll be away from our parents,

18:03.811 --> 18:06.440
but we'll be roommates
and we can share clothes.

18:06.441 --> 18:08.854
Actually, we can't.

18:08.855 --> 18:13.090
Well, you're right. I'm
a little bit more stylish.

18:13.091 --> 18:16.584
Olive, (Sighs) We can't share clothes
because I'm not going to be at the school.

18:16.585 --> 18:18.553
Your parents aren't letting you go?

18:18.554 --> 18:22.390
- I'm going to go talk to them right now!
- No! No. That's not it.

18:22.391 --> 18:24.559
They're actually really excited.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.573
Are you worried about sleeping
in a strange bed that hasn't been

18:27.574 --> 18:32.400
disinfected by your ultraviolet,
anti-bacterial furniture wand yet?

18:32.401 --> 18:35.821
Because I'm bringing mine!

18:36.205 --> 18:39.307
- No, that's not it.
- Oh, I know what it is.

18:39.308 --> 18:43.780
You're worried that because the school is
in Palo Alto, which means "tall sticks,"

18:43.781 --> 18:47.238
the school's gonna be
surrounded by scary tall sticks.

18:47.239 --> 18:49.880
But don't worry, Chyna,
they're just trees.

18:49.881 --> 18:52.821
They're just trees.

18:54.107 --> 18:56.832
I can't wait to get into our new
room. We could start decorating...

18:56.833 --> 18:59.245
I didn't get in, okay?

18:59.246 --> 19:01.213
(Sighs)

19:01.214 --> 19:03.382
I didn't get into the school.

19:03.383 --> 19:05.217
What?

19:05.218 --> 19:07.319
I can't believe this.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.808
(Stammers) I have got to sit down.

19:08.809 --> 19:10.969
(Buzzing)

19:13.260 --> 19:14.994
(Sighs)

19:14.995 --> 19:17.362
But you're the most
talented musician I know.

19:17.363 --> 19:20.934
And I was once on an airport
shuttle with Li'l Weezy.

19:20.935 --> 19:23.970
Well, apparently Weezy and I
are not as talented as Lexi.

19:23.971 --> 19:25.854
She got the spot for
the musical prodigy.

19:25.855 --> 19:28.735
What! Lexi got in?

19:29.117 --> 19:32.111
I don't want to be roommates with Lexi!

19:32.112 --> 19:34.848
I don't want to share clothes with her!

19:34.849 --> 19:36.728
Although she does have
some pretty nice things.

19:36.729 --> 19:40.954
Oh, she did just get some new
boots. Those things are kicking.

19:40.955 --> 19:42.995
(Sighs)

19:43.190 --> 19:47.393
You talked me into going to the school,
and now I have to go without you?

19:47.394 --> 19:49.428
I'm really sorry, Olive.

19:49.429 --> 19:51.330
And I don't know what to tell my dad.

19:51.331 --> 19:54.537
He's going around telling everyone
that his daughter got into the best,

19:54.538 --> 19:57.303
and freest school in the country.

19:57.304 --> 19:59.138
So what are you going to do?

19:59.139 --> 20:02.041
I guess I'm just going
to have to face the music.

20:02.042 --> 20:04.310
Hey, girls.

20:04.311 --> 20:06.245
Hi, dad. Listen... (Chuckling)

20:06.246 --> 20:09.756
I will listen to you playing
your going-away present!

20:09.757 --> 20:11.617
(Imitates playing guitar)

20:11.618 --> 20:14.918
A 1961 Harmon Tonemaster!

20:15.322 --> 20:17.223
But these are really expensive.

20:17.224 --> 20:21.027
We know you've been wanting one forever,
so your mom and I got one for you.

20:21.028 --> 20:23.096
Cameron even chipped in his allowance.

20:23.097 --> 20:27.100
He doesn't know it
yet, but he chipped in.

20:27.101 --> 20:30.069
Dad, thank you. But...

20:30.070 --> 20:32.171
You shouldn't have bought this for me.

20:32.172 --> 20:34.107
You deserve it!

20:34.108 --> 20:38.244
You're obviously the best at what you
do, so you should have the best guitar.

20:38.245 --> 20:41.280
We are going to miss you so much.

20:41.281 --> 20:44.117
Well, then, maybe I just shouldn't go.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.484
Are you kidding?

20:45.485 --> 20:48.792
You got into the best and
freest school in the country!

20:48.793 --> 20:51.913
I'm so proud of you.

20:52.092 --> 20:54.852
(Laughs nervously)

20:56.096 --> 20:58.316
You, too.

20:58.899 --> 21:00.070
(Sighs) (Door closes)

21:00.071 --> 21:03.325
Chyna. You didn't tell
him you didn't get in.

21:03.326 --> 21:07.491
Well, I couldn't! He
was just so happy for me.

21:07.492 --> 21:11.692
Don't worry. I'll tell him tomorrow.

21:12.379 --> 21:15.281
What? I said I was
gonna tell him tomorrow.

21:15.282 --> 21:19.422
Today's not tomorrow. Today's today.

21:20.120 --> 21:23.189
Chyna! What are you
doing at this school?

21:23.190 --> 21:24.732
Well, I was going to tell my dad,

21:24.733 --> 21:27.326
but he was so proud of me.
I couldn't break his heart!

21:27.327 --> 21:29.228
Anyway, the next thing
I knew, I was packing.

21:29.229 --> 21:32.031
And the next, next thing I
knew, he was dropping me off.

21:32.032 --> 21:34.033
And the next, next,
next thing I knew was...

21:34.034 --> 21:35.201
Well...

21:35.202 --> 21:38.202
Is this conversation.

21:42.233 --> 21:45.353
This place is awesome!

21:46.104 --> 21:49.072
Can you believe we live at Z-Tech now?

21:49.073 --> 21:51.374
Well, I guess we should
make ourselves at home.

21:51.375 --> 21:54.195
Way ahead of you.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.508
Ah.

22:01.631 --> 22:05.831
What? You don't live in a houseboat?

22:06.139 --> 22:07.306
There you are, Chyna.

22:07.307 --> 22:09.174
Of course I'm here.
Why wouldn't I be here?

22:09.175 --> 22:12.311
It's not like I don't belong here.

22:12.312 --> 22:13.445
Whatever.

22:13.446 --> 22:17.792
I was just going to make it clear that
even though I'm technically an Ant now.

22:17.793 --> 22:19.451
I'm not one of you.

22:19.452 --> 22:23.288
If anything, I'm the Queen Ant.

22:23.289 --> 22:26.739
There are no Queen Ant's.
You're thinking of bees.

22:26.740 --> 22:30.462
- Interesting factoid...
- Oh, great. You brought those with you.

22:30.463 --> 22:34.099
Ant colonies do have a Queen. She
is the most important Ant of all.

22:34.100 --> 22:36.168
- Exactly.
- She does none of the work.

22:36.169 --> 22:38.103
Nor should she.

22:38.104 --> 22:42.407
She is easily identified by her
grotesquely enlarged abdomen.

22:42.408 --> 22:45.768
Okay, I'm not the Queen.

22:48.114 --> 22:49.381
Zoltan: Hello, everyone.

22:49.382 --> 22:55.120
Welcome to the new Ant Farm,
your home for the next four years!

22:55.121 --> 22:58.223
Zoltan: This state of the art
facility includes your new school.

22:58.224 --> 23:02.027
Recreation facility,
and living quarters.

23:02.028 --> 23:03.863
Living quarters?

23:03.864 --> 23:07.299
You've invented living quarters!

23:07.300 --> 23:09.101
I guess I don't need
these dead ones anymore.

23:09.102 --> 23:11.742
(Coins clinking)

23:12.005 --> 23:13.171
All: Oh!

23:13.172 --> 23:16.755
Zoltan: You have been
selected as the best and...

23:16.756 --> 23:19.860
Mostly brightest students in the world.

23:19.861 --> 23:21.377
And by attending school here,

23:21.378 --> 23:25.450
there will be no limits to the
accomplishments that you can achieve!

23:25.451 --> 23:27.781
All accomplishments
become property of Z-Tech.

23:27.782 --> 23:28.919
(Thudding) Ow!

23:28.920 --> 23:31.323
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

23:31.324 --> 23:34.059
Is that a talking duffel bag?

23:34.060 --> 23:36.161
Oh, yeah.

23:36.162 --> 23:39.364
It's the latest in luggage technology.

23:39.365 --> 23:43.636
You see, I also have a talking hip sack.

23:43.637 --> 23:45.504
(In high-pitched voice)
People make fun of me,

23:45.505 --> 23:49.622
but I am one of the most convenient
and secure places to store cash,

23:49.623 --> 23:53.412
identification documents,
and other personal items.

23:53.413 --> 23:56.953
You said it, Sacky! Sacky...

23:58.217 --> 23:59.422
(Sighs)

23:59.423 --> 24:04.222
Anyway, your new Ant Farm is
the world's first roomavator.

24:04.223 --> 24:07.159
This entire room is in
the center of the building.

24:07.160 --> 24:10.024
It moves up and down like an elevator...

24:10.025 --> 24:14.165
And also rotates, like an elevator...

24:14.172 --> 24:16.201
That rotates.

24:16.202 --> 24:18.036
(Whirring)

24:18.037 --> 24:21.697
(Students exclaiming in wonder)

24:23.142 --> 24:26.011
Weird. It doesn't even
feel like we're moving.

24:26.012 --> 24:29.181
Much like a houseboat, my dear boy.

24:29.182 --> 24:32.351
That's because the roomavator
employs inertial dampeners.

24:32.352 --> 24:34.589
And because the Ant
Farm is a roomavator...

24:34.590 --> 24:38.090
These doors can open into
any room in the building.

24:38.091 --> 24:40.292
(Elevator dings)

24:40.293 --> 24:44.433
- One of our classrooms.
- All: Wow!

24:45.331 --> 24:46.855
The music room.

24:46.856 --> 24:49.101
Oh. You know who would love that?

24:49.102 --> 24:50.168
Me!

24:50.169 --> 24:52.630
Uh, no, baggy. (Kicks)

24:52.631 --> 24:57.442
Why would you, a talking
duffel bag, enjoy a music room?

24:57.443 --> 25:00.145
Can you believe her, Sacky?

25:00.146 --> 25:04.406
(In high-pitched voice) I know, right?

25:06.052 --> 25:09.154
- Let's just see the next room.
- (Beeping) Oh, careful!

25:09.155 --> 25:14.126
Some of the rooms in this building house
sensitive, top-secret R&D facilities.

25:14.127 --> 25:16.767
(Elevator dings)

25:17.030 --> 25:19.164
What is he doing?
(Lullaby playing on Mobile)

25:19.165 --> 25:23.435
Zoltan: Working on a
Mobile phone Mobile.

25:23.436 --> 25:27.272
Cell phones for babies
is a huge untapped market.

25:27.273 --> 25:31.461
Oh, of course, this project
is still in its infancy.

25:31.462 --> 25:33.682
(Laughing)

25:38.284 --> 25:44.044
We also have a fully equipped
health club and spa. (Dings)

25:48.161 --> 25:51.096
Oh, is this the tour?

25:51.097 --> 25:55.417
I kind of already showed myself around.

26:08.247 --> 26:10.347
(Grunts)

26:12.151 --> 26:14.018
- Ooh!
- Wow!

26:14.019 --> 26:16.321
This place is even more
awesome than I imagined.

26:16.322 --> 26:20.158
Not only do we have bedrooms, but
also this incredible living room.

26:20.159 --> 26:21.671
There's so much space!

26:21.672 --> 26:27.065
And I'm not just saying that because
I spent the last two hours in a bag.

26:27.066 --> 26:31.746
They even have this
really cool purple box!

26:32.305 --> 26:35.185
Oh, it's a piano.

26:36.109 --> 26:39.827
Now, why would they get me all
excited thinking it's a purple box?

26:39.828 --> 26:42.414
What a cool piano!

26:42.415 --> 26:44.449
What a cool piano.

26:44.450 --> 26:47.870
I wish I could live here.

26:48.187 --> 26:50.155
Why am I roommates with Olive?

26:50.156 --> 26:52.190
Chyna, I'm pretty sure
you requested Olive.

26:52.191 --> 26:56.194
And I definitely requested "not Olive".

26:56.195 --> 26:58.888
Uh, I can explain. It's because...

26:58.889 --> 27:01.906
There was a mix-up.
Chyna and I are roommates.

27:01.907 --> 27:04.787
This is your room.

27:06.105 --> 27:10.175
But there are already two girls in here.

27:10.176 --> 27:13.445
That one's your maid. Let's go.

27:13.446 --> 27:16.047
Oh. Let's go, let's go!

27:16.048 --> 27:20.728
These bags aren't going
to move themselves.

27:24.123 --> 27:26.124
I'm glad we got each other as roommates.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.360
I've never really been
away from my family.

27:28.361 --> 27:30.462
It'll be nice to have
a friendly face around.

27:30.463 --> 27:32.596
How did we even end up together?

27:32.597 --> 27:35.417
I requested Olive.

27:36.369 --> 27:39.969
I guess we should pick beds.

27:40.306 --> 27:42.886
(Bed squeaking)

27:49.048 --> 27:51.448
(Blows nose)

27:54.353 --> 27:57.533
You can have this one.

28:02.161 --> 28:04.229
Attention, everyone!

28:04.230 --> 28:08.399
I'm having the first party of the year
tonight to celebrate our new school.

28:08.400 --> 28:11.320
So all of your parties after
this will be compared to mine

28:11.321 --> 28:14.206
and considered painfully
dull and worthy of ridicule.

28:14.207 --> 28:17.147
Anyway, please come!

28:17.276 --> 28:19.736
Here you go.

28:20.179 --> 28:22.780
Oh. You'll already be there.

28:22.781 --> 28:25.121
Tidying up!

28:27.761 --> 28:28.763
Ooh!

28:28.764 --> 28:33.204
You definitely have to come to my party.

28:34.360 --> 28:38.396
Obviously, his talent is wearing jeans.

28:38.397 --> 28:41.065
Hi, I'm Lexi. Let me
tell you about my party.

28:41.066 --> 28:42.751
Oh, hi, I'm Kennedy.

28:42.752 --> 28:45.388
I was just about to
tell you about my party.

28:45.389 --> 28:48.373
- You're having a party?
- No, I'm starting a party.

28:48.374 --> 28:53.584
The Common Sense and Freedom party. I'm
planning to run for President in 2032.

28:53.585 --> 28:55.380
Ow!

28:55.381 --> 28:58.201
I feel your pain.

28:58.351 --> 29:00.864
Because I am in touch with the voters,

29:00.865 --> 29:03.859
who are increasingly losing
faith in the two-party system.

29:03.860 --> 29:06.213
They want a leader who
will focus on issues,

29:06.214 --> 29:09.127
not get mired in
partisanship and cronyism.

29:09.128 --> 29:11.948
I am that leader!

29:13.232 --> 29:16.200
Anyway, you wanted to
tell me about your party?

29:16.201 --> 29:18.841
Um, never mind.

29:21.173 --> 29:25.781
Look, Olive, I really appreciate you
tricking Lexi so we could room together.

29:25.782 --> 29:28.179
But one problem. I can't stay.

29:28.180 --> 29:30.181
Why not?

29:30.182 --> 29:32.250
Maybe you can stay and
live in here with me.

29:32.251 --> 29:34.118
What am I going to do about school?

29:34.119 --> 29:35.696
(Stammers) I could home school you.

29:35.697 --> 29:38.055
I know more than any teacher.

29:38.056 --> 29:39.436
- Olive, that's...
- Uh-uh-uh.

29:39.437 --> 29:43.328
We raise our hands to speak in class.

29:43.329 --> 29:45.669
Yes, Chyna.

29:45.698 --> 29:46.589
(Sighs)

29:46.590 --> 29:49.401
I would really love to stay.

29:49.402 --> 29:51.336
But I can't. (Sighs)

29:51.337 --> 29:55.206
Well, what are you going
to do about your dad?

29:55.207 --> 29:57.190
I guess I'll just call him...

29:57.191 --> 30:01.045
Get all weepy and say I miss him too
much and I want to move back home.

30:01.046 --> 30:04.316
He'll never know I didn't get in.

30:04.317 --> 30:06.384
(In sad voice) Hi, daddy.

30:06.385 --> 30:08.353
I miss you is all.

30:08.354 --> 30:12.290
Now that I'm here, I think
I might have made a mistake.

30:12.291 --> 30:16.060
I just love you so much and
I really wanna move back home.

30:16.061 --> 30:19.001
Please come get me.

30:19.097 --> 30:22.037
Okay. See you then.

30:23.302 --> 30:25.036
So he's coming to get you?

30:25.037 --> 30:28.440
Nope. He said suck it
up and give it a month.

30:28.441 --> 30:30.064
Oh, on the bright side,

30:30.065 --> 30:35.965
that's enough time to research
the term paper I'm assigning you.

30:46.349 --> 30:47.900
Knock, knock!

30:47.901 --> 30:50.252
- Who's there?
- Lexi.

30:50.253 --> 30:51.721
Lexi who?

30:51.722 --> 30:52.825
Lexi Reed.

30:52.826 --> 30:55.046
(Laughing)

30:56.426 --> 31:00.395
That's a good one! I'm gonna use that.

31:00.396 --> 31:04.399
Anyway, I just wanted to let you
know I'm having a party tonight.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.268
All the information is on this flyer.

31:06.269 --> 31:10.405
So be sure to stay
away during these hours.

31:10.406 --> 31:14.923
Oh, Angus. Here's an
un-invitation for you, too.

31:14.924 --> 31:20.824
I'd love to not come, but I'm
already not invited to another party.

31:29.092 --> 31:31.682
- Knock, knock.
- Come in.

31:31.683 --> 31:33.362
Lexi.

31:33.363 --> 31:35.193
Lexi's not here.

31:35.194 --> 31:38.194
Lexi Reed! (Cackling)

31:40.403 --> 31:42.404
All right, well, that was my best joke.

31:42.405 --> 31:45.574
If that doesn't cheer her
up, I don't know what will.

31:45.575 --> 31:48.027
You told him I didn't get in?

31:48.028 --> 31:50.737
- He pried it out of me.
- How?

31:50.738 --> 31:53.918
He said, "'sup, Olive?"

31:55.451 --> 31:58.353
Being without my best
friend is not an option.

31:58.354 --> 32:01.808
We have to figure out
a way for Chyna to stay.

32:01.809 --> 32:03.431
Come on, we're smart.

32:03.432 --> 32:07.496
I mean, two of us got into a very
prestigious school for prodigies.

32:07.497 --> 32:09.431
Look, it's no use.

32:09.432 --> 32:13.924
I thought Mr. Grundy liked my a
capella song, but I guess he didn't.

32:13.925 --> 32:15.704
A capella?

32:15.705 --> 32:17.406
I've never even heard of that song.

32:17.407 --> 32:22.567
Now "Jingle Bells", there's
a song everyone loves.

32:23.379 --> 32:27.416
You sang a capella,
like just your voice?

32:27.417 --> 32:30.119
(Scoffs) You play 47 instruments!

32:30.120 --> 32:33.122
That would be like Fletcher
doing a painting without paint.

32:33.123 --> 32:35.257
Actually, I did. Rather
than using the traditional...

32:35.258 --> 32:38.378
Nobody cares, Fletcher!

32:41.231 --> 32:47.109
What if I re-record my song and
show Mr. Grundy what I can really do?

32:47.110 --> 32:49.661
Tonight, we'll sneak
into that music studio,

32:49.662 --> 32:53.442
and record a new version of my song
with me playing every instrument!

32:53.443 --> 32:55.377
That's a great idea.

32:55.378 --> 32:57.843
Yeah, well, with "Jingle Bells"...

32:57.844 --> 33:03.184
You only need two instruments,
jingle bells and this.

33:08.524 --> 33:11.584
(Upbeat music playing)

33:12.528 --> 33:15.048
(All cheering)

33:16.233 --> 33:17.499
What are you guys doing?

33:17.500 --> 33:20.136
Oh, we're trying to
figure out the cat daddy.

33:20.137 --> 33:24.277
Oh, that's easy. It goes like this.

33:25.242 --> 33:27.176
What are you doing?

33:27.177 --> 33:28.343
Showing you the Cat Daddy.

33:28.344 --> 33:32.035
No. Seth is showing us the cat daddy.

33:32.036 --> 33:35.459
I'm running a series of feline DNA tests
to determine who fathered these kittens.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.980
(Both meowing)

33:38.321 --> 33:40.555
That is not a fun
thing to do at a party!

33:40.556 --> 33:45.360
It is to them. What do you expect?
You're in a school full of eggheads.

33:45.361 --> 33:50.281
Wanna have a real party?
Come to my houseboat.

33:50.366 --> 33:54.536
But if these guys are all nerds,
they're even less cool than...

33:54.537 --> 33:56.757
You guys!

33:56.966 --> 34:01.110
Well, thank you. I've been saying
we're the less uncool kids for years.

34:01.111 --> 34:05.514
Probably couldn't hear me because I
was in a trash can most of the time.

34:05.515 --> 34:07.612
Come on. We've got to
get to that music studio!

34:07.613 --> 34:10.252
Lexi: No, wait! You
guys can't leave! Stay!

34:10.253 --> 34:12.221
Chyna, sing Dynamite!

34:12.222 --> 34:13.773
Olive, tell us a boring fact!

34:13.774 --> 34:15.190
Fletcher!

34:15.192 --> 34:17.458
You can go.

34:17.460 --> 34:22.080
You guys... wait! Stop
it! Come on! Chyna!

34:23.107 --> 34:27.168
Oh, well. At least Angus
Is doing the Cat Daddy.

34:27.170 --> 34:31.007
He's not. That's the
cat mommy on his face.

34:31.007 --> 34:33.947
(Yowling) (Screaming)

34:34.311 --> 34:35.914
Get it off!

34:35.915 --> 34:38.315
Get it off!

34:38.514 --> 34:42.414
He got too close to the kittens.

34:43.518 --> 34:47.156
Okay. Let's get to that music
room before anyone catches us.

34:47.157 --> 34:48.224
(Dings)

34:48.225 --> 34:50.031
(Groaning)

34:50.032 --> 34:54.292
It stings! Why did I ask for pickles?

34:58.268 --> 35:01.504
You're not doing it right.
You select the floor...

35:01.505 --> 35:03.305
Then the room.

35:03.306 --> 35:06.075
(Beeping) (Elevator whirs)

35:06.076 --> 35:08.656
(All screaming)

35:10.180 --> 35:13.448
Neither of you know what you're doing!

35:13.449 --> 35:15.489
(Dings)

35:15.518 --> 35:17.938
That's a cheese shop. You
don't know how to use it either.

35:17.939 --> 35:22.920
Sure I do. I just wanted another
wedge of this delicious Gorgonzola.

35:22.921 --> 35:25.915
They admitted a cheese-making
prodigy, and not me?

35:25.916 --> 35:28.197
I got to record that song! (Beeping)

35:28.198 --> 35:30.009
- Let me do it!
- No, let me.

35:30.010 --> 35:32.590
(Girls arguing)

35:36.506 --> 35:39.326
(Elevator stalling)

35:40.971 --> 35:45.247
Great, it's broken.
We're not going anywhere.

35:45.248 --> 35:48.217
We're stuck in an elevator?

35:48.218 --> 35:52.354
Oh, no! Oh, no! I gotta get out of here.

35:52.355 --> 35:55.838
Fletcher, how can you be
claustrophobic in such a huge room?

35:55.839 --> 35:58.294
I'm not. I'm agoraphobic.

35:58.295 --> 36:00.612
Afraid of open spaces.

36:00.613 --> 36:05.593
Why can't we be trapped
in a smaller elevator?

36:10.440 --> 36:15.244
We're trapped! Trapped
in here! I can't breathe!

36:15.245 --> 36:17.446
Neither can I. (Sniffs)

36:17.447 --> 36:21.407
Would you put away the Gorgonzola?

36:23.153 --> 36:24.995
No one panic.

36:24.996 --> 36:30.159
- Maybe we can fix this thing.
- I know. I'll call tech support.

36:30.160 --> 36:34.120
Tech support. How may I help you?

36:36.433 --> 36:39.301
When is Cindy going to
have that baby already?

36:39.302 --> 36:42.171
Hey, maybe we can pry open the doors.

36:42.172 --> 36:44.239
- Oh, good idea.
- Yeah.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.760
(All grunting)

36:50.886 --> 36:54.011
Great! We're stuck between floors.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.550
What's down there?

36:55.551 --> 36:58.938
Oh, I think it's that
top-secret R&B lab.

36:58.939 --> 37:02.076
It's an R&D lab, not an R&B lab.

37:02.077 --> 37:05.413
Scientists don't go in there
to make funky soul music.

37:05.414 --> 37:07.215
I wish it were an R&B lab.

37:07.216 --> 37:10.733
Because if I don't record this
song tonight, I'm out of here.

37:10.734 --> 37:13.021
Fletcher: Well...

37:13.022 --> 37:15.323
Looks like this is the only
way out of the Ant Farm.

37:15.324 --> 37:19.193
Oh, it's pretty dark in there.
How long a fall do you think it is?

37:19.194 --> 37:25.094
We should drop something in and listen
to how long it takes to hit the ground.

37:28.341 --> 37:30.895
Fletcher: Olive?

37:30.896 --> 37:33.784
Give me your cheese.

37:33.785 --> 37:37.205
(Fletcher screaming) (Thuds)

37:39.248 --> 37:41.048
Ow!

37:44.086 --> 37:47.986
- It's about eight feet.
- Yeah.

37:49.224 --> 37:52.126
All: Raise the roof! Raise the roof!

37:52.127 --> 37:53.161
Raise the roof!

37:53.162 --> 37:55.600
Finally people are partying!

37:55.601 --> 37:57.031
What are you guys doing?

37:57.032 --> 38:00.401
Watching a documentary of these
farmers raising the roof of their barn.

38:00.402 --> 38:02.136
Oh, they're done. (Cows mooing)

38:02.137 --> 38:04.748
All: Milk that cow! Milk that cow!

38:04.749 --> 38:07.673
Stop it! This is a party!

38:07.674 --> 38:10.011
Can we at least do something fun?

38:10.012 --> 38:15.383
More fun than watching farmers,
the backbone of this great country?

38:15.384 --> 38:17.244
Yes!

38:17.698 --> 38:18.987
I know.

38:18.988 --> 38:21.189
We can play I Confess.

38:21.190 --> 38:24.192
Everybody, sit in a circle.

38:24.193 --> 38:26.294
We should sit in a hexagon.

38:26.295 --> 38:30.231
As the honeycomb has shown us, it's a
far more geometrically efficient shape.

38:30.232 --> 38:33.134
Just ask the bees. Or I could ask them.

38:33.135 --> 38:35.203
I speak bee.

38:35.204 --> 38:37.844
(Mimics buzzing)

38:39.174 --> 38:42.594
Just sit down, hunky nerd!

38:44.179 --> 38:49.350
Okay, everybody gets 10 grapes, and then
somebody confesses something they've done.

38:49.351 --> 38:51.775
If you've also done it,
you keep your grapes.

38:51.776 --> 38:55.721
And if you haven't, you have to
give your grapes to the confessor.

38:55.722 --> 38:58.605
Let's start with something tame.

38:58.606 --> 39:04.306
I confess that I've kissed
a member of the opposite sex.

39:06.325 --> 39:07.865
Okay.

39:07.866 --> 39:09.786
Um...

39:10.172 --> 39:15.872
I confess that I've hugged
a member of the opposite sex.

39:18.430 --> 39:20.314
Um...

39:20.315 --> 39:22.655
Held hands?

39:23.952 --> 39:29.852
I would never let my campaign be
tainted by a smutty hand-holding scandal.

39:30.421 --> 39:32.701
Talked to?

39:36.098 --> 39:39.398
Female bees don't count.

39:45.006 --> 39:46.327
Chyna: Okay.

39:46.328 --> 39:50.044
There must be some way to the music
studio without using the roomavator.

39:50.045 --> 39:55.945
So, let's look for a roomscalator, or a
staircasatron, or even a rope-a-ladder.

39:56.151 --> 39:57.836
You mean a rope ladder?

39:57.837 --> 40:01.322
When you say it like that, it
doesn't sound high-tech at all.

40:01.323 --> 40:03.654
Wow! What is this?

40:03.655 --> 40:06.026
Some sort of space-age kaleidoscope?

40:06.027 --> 40:09.363
(Scoffs) Careful, Fletcher!
Z-Tech does work for the military.

40:09.364 --> 40:11.639
That's probably some sort
of experimental weapon

40:11.640 --> 40:14.302
that will take out an entire city block!

40:14.303 --> 40:16.523
(Whirring)

40:17.139 --> 40:19.140
(Vomiting)

40:19.141 --> 40:21.275
Or it's a barf gun.

40:21.276 --> 40:23.111
I read about this research!

40:23.112 --> 40:27.315
It's a non-lethal way to disorient and
temporarily incapacitate your enemy.

40:27.316 --> 40:28.963
Cool!

40:28.964 --> 40:33.387
This is for shoving me
out of the roomavator!

40:33.388 --> 40:35.608
(Vomiting)

40:37.025 --> 40:40.428
There's no proof that worked. I could have
just thrown up from looking at your face.

40:40.429 --> 40:46.300
Guys! Can we please stop making each
other throw up and just focus on...

40:46.301 --> 40:48.035
(Vomiting)

40:48.036 --> 40:50.338
I was wrong. It does work.

40:50.339 --> 40:53.508
Okay, will you cut it out and
start looking for an emergency exit?

40:53.509 --> 40:55.549
(Sighs)

40:55.862 --> 40:58.999
Someone's coming! Hide!

40:59.000 --> 41:03.080
Did you try taking out the battery?

41:03.218 --> 41:06.187
How are we going to get past him?

41:06.188 --> 41:12.088
- We can make him throw up!
- Quick, Fletcher, show him your face!

41:13.094 --> 41:17.031
Thank you for calling
Z-Tech. Have a nice day.

41:17.032 --> 41:19.252
(Vomiting)

41:23.138 --> 41:24.472
Wow!

41:24.473 --> 41:29.873
Rainbow sherbet looks exactly
the same coming back up.

41:32.281 --> 41:33.347
(All panting)

41:33.348 --> 41:39.086
Thank goodness that secret door led to the
room where they keep the rope-a-ladders.

41:39.087 --> 41:41.662
Okay, so now I just need
to lay down some tracks.

41:41.663 --> 41:45.326
You have a song to record. You don't
have time to play with model trains!

41:45.327 --> 41:47.643
She doesn't, but we do!

41:47.644 --> 41:52.132
Let's recreate the 1869 joining of the
Central and Union Pacific Railroads.

41:52.133 --> 41:54.253
I'll be rail road baron Jay Gould,

41:54.254 --> 41:58.296
and you'll be the stubborn
widow who won't sell her land!

41:58.297 --> 41:59.240
New plan.

41:59.241 --> 42:02.043
I'm going to record the song and
you guys are going to sit here,

42:02.044 --> 42:04.245
and silently support me.

42:04.246 --> 42:07.893
I don't think I can do that.

42:07.894 --> 42:10.474
(Playing piano)

42:17.426 --> 42:20.066
(Bells jingling)

42:20.262 --> 42:22.162
What are you doing?

42:22.163 --> 42:27.443
Trust me. Everything sounds
better with jingle bells.

42:29.204 --> 42:31.899
Who do you think you are, Widow Hartley?

42:31.900 --> 42:36.760
No one says no to rail
road baron Jay Gould.

42:40.349 --> 42:41.840
Come on!

42:41.841 --> 42:47.729
Seriously, no one's ever made eye
contact with someone of the opposite sex?

42:47.730 --> 42:51.510
You nerds are ruining my party!

42:52.127 --> 42:54.830
Don't worry. Things are
about to start heating up!

42:54.831 --> 42:55.726
Really?

42:55.727 --> 43:00.100
Because Seth is going to figure out
the boiling point of ethylene glycol!

43:00.101 --> 43:01.335
Fascinating!

43:01.336 --> 43:04.138
You've got to be kidding me!

43:04.139 --> 43:06.106
(Grunts)

43:06.107 --> 43:11.445
You're the biggest waste of
hunkiness I've ever seen in my life!

43:11.446 --> 43:14.214
Well, now we know the boiling
point of a blonde girl.

43:14.215 --> 43:15.633
(Laughing)

43:15.634 --> 43:18.862
Hey, here's a game we
can play, Hide And Seek.

43:18.863 --> 43:21.221
I'll hide, and you guys seek.

43:21.222 --> 43:22.704
Counseling.

43:22.705 --> 43:26.777
I've had it with you people! I am
not one of you, and I never will be!

43:26.778 --> 43:31.998
You guys can stay at this
party, but I'm leaving!

43:33.001 --> 43:37.861
It's broken. I tried
to leave two hours ago.

43:43.554 --> 43:45.594
(Dings)

43:46.080 --> 43:49.350
Oh. Looks like they got
the roomavator fixed.

43:49.351 --> 43:52.353
Not that we know anything
about it being broken.

43:52.354 --> 43:55.582
Was it broken? I don't
know. I have no idea.

43:55.583 --> 43:58.703
I haven't touched it.

44:02.280 --> 44:05.030
Well, well, well.

44:05.031 --> 44:07.791
Look who's here.

44:08.236 --> 44:12.076
Cindy! She finally had her baby!

44:15.706 --> 44:19.186
Oh, (Sighs) And also Chyna.

44:20.014 --> 44:25.512
Look, Mr. Grundy, I know I
didn't get into this school.

44:25.513 --> 44:29.212
What! Chyna didn't get in?
(Gasps) That's terrible!

44:29.213 --> 44:32.453
I feel so bad for you!

44:33.462 --> 44:36.364
Please, Mr. Grundy, just
give me another chance.

44:36.365 --> 44:38.442
I recorded a new version
of my audition song,

44:38.443 --> 44:40.557
and I'm begging you to
let me play it for you.

44:40.558 --> 44:42.336
Don't bother.

44:42.337 --> 44:45.643
Come on! She deserves to
be here more than anyone!

44:45.644 --> 44:47.588
Yeah. She's the most
talented person I know!

44:47.589 --> 44:50.210
And she knows Li'l Weezy!

44:50.211 --> 44:53.647
I meant don't bother because
I've already seen the video.

44:53.648 --> 44:55.733
I don't think I've made a video yet.

44:55.734 --> 45:00.287
Yes, you have. This building houses one of
the world's largest technology companies.

45:00.288 --> 45:02.829
Did it not occur to you when
you were sneaking around,

45:02.830 --> 45:05.993
that we might have
security surveillance?

45:05.994 --> 45:09.859
- You caught us on camera?
- Actually, dozens of cameras.

45:09.860 --> 45:15.760
We can watch it on the Super Mega
Jumbo Ultra Maxi Z-Phone Plus Extreme.

45:16.842 --> 45:19.782

46:34.829 --> 46:37.349
(All cheering)

46:40.845 --> 46:43.785
That was incredible.

46:43.792 --> 46:46.126
The work of a true prodigy.

46:46.127 --> 46:48.758
So I'm in? You'll let me in the school?

46:48.759 --> 46:50.437
No.

46:50.438 --> 46:54.234
Sorry, I told you already, I
picked a different musical prodigy.

46:54.235 --> 46:58.435
Seriously? You picked Lexi over Chyna?

46:58.493 --> 47:02.093
Lexi? Lexi's a math prodigy.

47:02.176 --> 47:04.562
He means I'm good with numbers.

47:04.563 --> 47:07.412
Musical numbers. Because
I'm a musical prodigy.

47:07.413 --> 47:10.473
Yeah, let's move on.

47:11.119 --> 47:14.121
- What are you talking about?
- Lexi came in to audition...

47:14.122 --> 47:16.023
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:16.024 --> 47:21.924
You know, if they're gonna find out
anyway, at least let me talk about myself.

47:22.468 --> 47:27.167
I came in to the audition
wearing a beautiful red dress.

47:27.168 --> 47:29.102
<i>♪Exceptional.</i>

47:29.103 --> 47:30.540

47:30.541 --> 47:32.467

47:32.468 --> 47:34.397
<i>♪Me, me.</i>

47:34.398 --> 47:36.378
<i>♪Me.</i>

47:38.312 --> 47:41.746
I've also been the star of many school
plays, want to see some pictures?

47:41.747 --> 47:44.117
Ah! I see you have the classic Z-Phone.

47:44.118 --> 47:46.989
Yeah. Well, I was going to
upgrade to the Z-Phone 2.

47:46.990 --> 47:50.260
But then I realized that even though
the extra half-inch of display size,

47:50.261 --> 47:52.874
means 17.74% more screen area.

47:52.875 --> 47:57.869
And the higher resolution increases
the total number of pixels by 192,000.

47:57.870 --> 48:03.003
It really only increases the
pixels per square inch by 7.49%.

48:03.004 --> 48:07.312
Hardly worthwhile when you consider
that the Z-Phone 2 costs 25% more.

48:07.313 --> 48:12.953
And 33.8% more if you take
the rip-off protection plan.

48:14.348 --> 48:17.945
You do enough shopping,
you get good with numbers.

48:17.946 --> 48:20.436
So you are one of us!

48:20.437 --> 48:23.190
You're a math nerd!

48:23.191 --> 48:27.151
I prefer the term "math princess".

48:27.953 --> 48:32.456
So, if Lexi's not the
musical prodigy, then who is?

48:32.457 --> 48:34.377
Um...

48:35.169 --> 48:37.204
My nephew, Zev.

48:37.205 --> 48:40.741
And what instrument does he play?

48:40.742 --> 48:42.782
Guitar.

48:51.086 --> 48:53.846
Well, air guitar.

48:54.388 --> 48:59.093
My sister Zelda said if I didn't
take him, she'd take away my new dog.

48:59.094 --> 49:01.974
And I love 123456.

49:03.131 --> 49:08.135
But you own the school, and nothing says
that you can't admit two musical prodigies.

49:08.136 --> 49:11.916
Or one musical prodigy and him.

49:13.041 --> 49:15.042
That 'tis true.

49:15.043 --> 49:18.012
I don't need to choose only
one type of each prodigy.

49:18.013 --> 49:19.287
Oh!

49:19.288 --> 49:24.585
Why did I turn away all those
other talented bee-talkers?

49:24.586 --> 49:27.614
Chyna, welcome to the program.

49:27.615 --> 49:31.095
(Both exclaiming in delight)

49:33.227 --> 49:35.087
Yay!

49:36.297 --> 49:39.033
Thank you so much, Mr. Grundy!

49:39.034 --> 49:41.558
- How can I repay you?
- You can't.

49:41.559 --> 49:44.739
I'm worth $62 billion!

49:46.374 --> 49:52.274
If you're worth that much money, we
need to discuss hiring better maids.

49:58.219 --> 50:00.674
Isn't this great, Olive?

50:00.675 --> 50:03.642
Being roommates, living together!

50:03.643 --> 50:06.645
It'll be like a slumber
party every night!

50:06.646 --> 50:08.580
I can talk about boys!

50:08.581 --> 50:12.484
You can talk about rail
road baron, Jay Gould.

50:12.485 --> 50:13.822
(Sighs)

50:13.823 --> 50:15.321
I love this place.

50:15.322 --> 50:16.488
(Air whooshing)

50:16.489 --> 50:18.490
Don't you love this place?

50:18.491 --> 50:20.459
They're just trees.

50:20.460 --> 50:23.400
They're just trees.

50:25.127 --> 50:27.659
Roommates, huh?

50:27.660 --> 50:33.560
