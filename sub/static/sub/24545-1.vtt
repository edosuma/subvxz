20:12.298 --> 20:13.821
It has begun...

20:14.952 --> 20:15.997
the Apocalypse.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.174
But do you people think that it

20:19.348 --> 20:22.569
started with companies like
New World Genetics

20:22.743 --> 20:24.484
altering of life?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.530
With the pollution?

20:27.965 --> 20:29.489
The pesticides?

20:30.794 --> 20:31.752
No.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.364
It started a long time ago.

20:35.886 --> 20:39.020
It started when we told God
that we don't need Him anymore

20:39.194 --> 20:40.717
and we welcomed in
the Other One.

20:40.891 --> 20:45.069
And he became our new resident,
our resident evil.

20:45.722 --> 20:49.509
And it's true, we conquered the
plague that is cancer.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.600
But a new disease will arise...

20:54.992 --> 20:56.429
deadlier...

20:57.256 --> 20:59.345
stronger...

21:00.737 --> 21:03.305
I mean do you think if we
created immortal life,

21:03.479 --> 21:06.395
that we, as human beings,
will become kinder?

21:08.310 --> 21:10.399
That we will become more
generous?

21:12.532 --> 21:13.446
No.

21:14.708 --> 21:16.579
You will be dead in immortality

21:16.753 --> 21:19.843
because your soul will belong
to the Other One.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.758
Is it too late? No.

21:22.063 --> 21:25.371
But we must humble our backs
and beg for forgiveness.

21:25.675 --> 21:27.895
We must ask our Christ to come
down to save us.

21:28.069 --> 21:30.289
We must ask Christ, Our Lord,

21:30.506 --> 21:32.508
to come an evict our
new resident

21:32.682 --> 21:35.250
from our minds
and from our hearts.

21:35.511 --> 21:38.253
We must surrender to prayer
and to faith.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.734
That is only way we will
survive.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.911
That is the only way
to be immortal.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.088
Love is immortal.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.656
Christ is love.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.660
Love one another.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.793
Love one another,
now and forever

21:56.967 --> 21:59.622

the end of times.

You are the crazy billionaire
that gave

22:23.559 --> 22:26.257
his fortune away
and left the world?

22:26.606 --> 22:28.129
And now, you're preaching on

22:28.303 --> 22:32.960
the corner of my street...
about paradise.

22:33.134 --> 22:35.266
About penitence.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.965
So you really think your Christ
will come from the sky

22:38.139 --> 22:40.402
and save you
because you repent.

22:40.620 --> 22:43.274
I know that Christ
will come back,

22:43.449 --> 22:45.929
and only those that repent
will be saved.

22:56.418 --> 22:57.506
You obviously understand that

22:57.680 --> 23:00.335
Dr. Zachary speaks
metaphorically.

23:00.509 --> 23:03.294
Yes, we are at
the end of times.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.820
But we're not here to
acknowledge our extinction...

23:07.690 --> 23:09.910
but to unveil the elixir...

23:11.041 --> 23:12.478
for eternal life.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.093
-John, John.
-Yes.

23:19.528 --> 23:20.921
I want to ask you something.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.096
Sure.

23:22.313 --> 23:24.315
People listen to you.

23:25.229 --> 23:27.841
What do you tell those who
don't care about anything

23:28.015 --> 23:28.929
you said in there?

23:30.060 --> 23:32.672
Jesus, now the joke
of trendy people,

23:32.846 --> 23:34.848
was, is, and always
has been love.

23:35.675 --> 23:38.025
I guess that is what I would
tell them.

23:38.329 --> 23:41.985
What about those
that reject Him?

23:43.247 --> 23:44.771
If there was anything
else to say,

23:44.945 --> 23:47.556
I guess it would be
"That it's never too late".

23:48.688 --> 23:50.516

24:00.395 --> 24:04.443

of our street about love.

to give love.

Yes, the world needs
to hear his crazy theories
