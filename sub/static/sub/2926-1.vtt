24:11.920 --> 24:12.967
[COUGHS]

24:13.160 --> 24:15.527
You did understand the part about me...

24:16.240 --> 24:18.322
coming here to steal from you, yeah?

24:19.040 --> 24:20.883
It's my father, technically.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.605
I broke in.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.847
Where?

24:24.320 --> 24:26.607
He takes epic measures to bar entry.

24:26.800 --> 24:30.361
Well, actually, you left the door to
the roof wedged open. So I just...

24:30.560 --> 24:32.767
- Did I?
- Yeah.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.563
I must stop doing that.

24:35.760 --> 24:36.807
Yeah.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.082
I mean, you should be scared.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.047
Well, I'm not.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.004
No, I can see that.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.801
The tea is lovely.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.249
It's called Lapsang Souchong.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.489
It's black and from China.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.485
It's too hot for me to drink...

24:59.920 --> 25:02.571
but the smell always reminds me
of London.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.569
I've never been to London.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.206
I didn't think so. No. Heh.

What's wrong with you,
if you don't mind me asking?

25:22.400 --> 25:23.811
Consumption.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.963
I'm 21 and I've never been kissed
on the mouth.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.002
Sorry, that came out wrong.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.408
I don't know anyone, you see.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.440
I can't go out. I can't dance.

25:40.600 --> 25:44.366
I sleep in a tent on the roof
to keep my body temperature within reason.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.241
I have maybe...

25:48.960 --> 25:52.806
according to one doctor who came up
from Baltimore, a year and a half.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.567
In Boston, they said six months.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.129
But that was eight months ago...

26:00.320 --> 26:04.450
so really, I'm already two months dead.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.725

26:15.080 --> 26:17.003

26:20.360 --> 26:21.521
A boat.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.569
[LAUGHS]

26:24.000 --> 26:25.525
- A boat?
- Yeah.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.889
I never knew my parents.
Boat washed up ashore in Brooklyn.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.965
So I was told.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.406
And you steal things.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.602
I do steal things. Yeah, from time to time.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.249
It wasn't always that way, though.

26:37.440 --> 26:41.206
I always wanted to be a mechanic.
You know, I always had a knack...

26:41.560 --> 26:45.201
for fixing things,
getting to the insides of things.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.210
Like safes.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.244
Well, that's how it ended up, anyways.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.568
Lately, I've been having a bit
of a disagreement with an old boss.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.962
I should imagine disputes
in your line of work are hard to settle.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.730
Challenging, yeah.

27:00.360 --> 27:03.125
What's the best thing you've ever stolen?

27:08.480 --> 27:10.767
I'm beginning to think I
haven't stolen it yet.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.168
Aren't you the charmer.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.449
Lovely to meet you, Peter Lake.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.689
Listen, I have to leave New York.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.490
A few months at most.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.088
Let that disagreement blow over.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.841
But maybe when I get back,
I was wondering if...

27:41.040 --> 27:43.042
I'm going to the country myself.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.561
And by the time you get back...

27:50.480 --> 27:52.289
I'll already be dead.

28:01.520 --> 28:04.205
Please don't steal anything
on your way out.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.930

28:21.400 --> 28:23.323

28:57.520 --> 29:00.410
Mr. Soames, sir.
How many are you going to have?

29:00.600 --> 29:02.284
Just keep them coming.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.528
I'll tell you what they're trying to do.

29:06.760 --> 29:10.242
What they're trying to do
is to fill the whole sky with stars.

29:10.480 --> 29:15.361
They got little spots all picked out up
there for each and every virtuous soul.

29:16.600 --> 29:20.207
Ain't no room in the heavens
for the likes of us, though, boys. Heh.

29:20.440 --> 29:23.808
No room for Pearly Soames.
No room at all.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.525
I wonder how they choose
the color of their wings.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.362
I've always wanted wings.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.729
I'd like a pair of wings myself,
you know?

29:32.920 --> 29:34.001
Anything more, sir?

29:35.440 --> 29:36.487
Oh, yes, please.

29:36.680 --> 29:41.971
I would like to have
a South African spotted eagle owl...

29:42.160 --> 29:44.242
uh, if you could
butterfly it, thank you...

29:44.440 --> 29:47.091
and pan-fry it, uh,
with some potatoes would be lovely.

29:47.280 --> 29:50.887
A little bit of parsley on top.
Take off the beak and the feet, please.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.048
I'm sorry, sir. Don't got no owl.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.085
Find her.

30:19.800 --> 30:23.850
You find her, and you're gonna find him.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.481
- Find who?
- The girl.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.961
- What girl?
- The red-haired girl.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.241
Which red-haired girl?

30:32.880 --> 30:36.521
That one. You see, Romeo?
That red-haired girl.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.008
The one who is his destiny.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.044
That all of it, miss?

30:49.360 --> 30:50.885
All of it? Heh.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.651
No, not even close.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.487
What?

31:21.680 --> 31:25.844
I just remembered the day we pulled you
out of the drink in that silly little boat.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.525
I need some friendly advice. I met a girl.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.609
- Oh, I see.
- We've nothing in common.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.006
Hmm.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.969
- She's dying.
- Well, aren't we all?

31:36.200 --> 31:39.568
Well, not just dying. She's consumptive.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.331
- Ah.
- Near death.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.445
We've only just met.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.488
- I feel like I've known her a thousand years.
- Hmm.

31:50.080 --> 31:54.005
Pearly's on top of me. If I don't get out
of town, I'm as good as killing myself.

31:54.200 --> 31:56.965
Peter, is there a question here?

31:57.320 --> 31:58.765
What should I do?

32:02.000 --> 32:03.650
When I think of her...

32:04.160 --> 32:05.810
I've never felt this way before.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.206
Why now?

32:08.000 --> 32:11.447
Peter, our people have 10 songs.

32:12.560 --> 32:17.202
The songs tell us
that inside of each of us is a miracle.

32:18.200 --> 32:22.683
And that miracle is meant for one person,
and one person alone.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.363
And when we're close,
the universe reaches down...

32:26.560 --> 32:29.370
and helps us fulfill our destiny.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.211
And the universe helps us?
How, exactly?

32:32.400 --> 32:34.971
Well, the universe sends us spirit guides.

32:35.160 --> 32:38.209
Sometimes they speak to us
through small children.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.847
They often appear as animals.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.884
One is Athansor. He's the Dog of the East.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.171
He sometimes appears as a white horse.

32:54.320 --> 32:58.245
Perhaps this girl is the person
that your miracle is for.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.889
But if so, know this:

33:01.120 --> 33:04.010
- Chaos has agents too.
- What are you talking about?

33:04.200 --> 33:05.770
God and the devil?

33:06.440 --> 33:07.726
Angels and demons?

33:08.200 --> 33:10.248
Those are some of the newer names, yes.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.805
All I know...

33:13.640 --> 33:15.130
is that I'm pulled to her...

33:15.720 --> 33:17.848
like air when I'm under the water.

33:19.280 --> 33:22.409

talking to me for?

33:32.560 --> 33:34.164

34:42.920 --> 34:45.081
I raised him as my own.

34:47.280 --> 34:50.681
I had him pegged to inherit the keys
to the kingdom.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.487
But little Peter...

34:54.679 --> 34:57.047
he started to having ideas.

without spilling blood.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.564
Here's how to take a ring
and leave the finger.

But, you see, Beverly Penn...

35:08.360 --> 35:09.805
in my line...

35:11.560 --> 35:14.245
it's the ripples that
give the work meaning.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.245

35:17.960 --> 35:20.201
they can do more good than harm.

of the plan, you see.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.369
No, it's fillet.

40:48.680 --> 40:52.366
Just as in wallet. You don't say
"wallet," do you? You say wallet.

- Sir?

41:02.200 --> 41:04.202
You look like a crook.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.008
Who are you? What do you do?

41:08.200 --> 41:11.727
What is your relationship to Beverly?
Are you aware of her special condition?

41:11.920 --> 41:14.366
What are your motivations,
intentions and desires?

41:14.560 --> 41:16.688
Tell the absolute truth. Don't elaborate.

41:16.880 --> 41:20.726
Stop if a neighbor,
child or servant comes in. And be brief.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.048
Be brief?
These are complicated questions.

41:23.240 --> 41:26.050
If you were one of my journalists,
you'd be finished by now.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.846
God created the world in six days.
Ape him.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.441
- Heh. I'll try.
- It's unnecessary.

41:31.640 --> 41:32.971
- All right.
- Unnecessary.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.201
My name is Peter Lake.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.370
You're right, I'm a thief,
and I'm a damn good one.

41:38.600 --> 41:39.647
I love Beverly.

41:39.840 --> 41:41.365
Our relationship goes by no name.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.204
I have no intentions.

41:43.800 --> 41:46.246
I desire her, and I am moved by love.

41:46.480 --> 41:47.527
Do you understand?

41:47.720 --> 41:50.769
How do I know that you're not moved
by vanity or curiosity?

41:50.960 --> 41:53.725
How do I know you're not here
for the money in this family?

41:53.920 --> 41:56.241
I was an orphan.
Orphans don't have vanity.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.967
I'm not sure why,
but one needs parents to be vain.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.931
And the money?

42:01.760 --> 42:04.730
I wouldn't take a penny from you,
for a start.

42:06.120 --> 42:09.488
I would accept no favors,
not even a kind word said on my behalf.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.529
And of her condition?

42:15.320 --> 42:17.448
I've never loved much before.

42:18.640 --> 42:19.971
So death...

42:21.120 --> 42:23.282
hasn't been something to be avoided.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.642
But now when I think of losing her...

42:31.120 --> 42:34.806
Is it possible to love someone
so completely they simply can't die?

42:35.960 --> 42:37.007
No.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.811
But I'm a thief...

42:41.880 --> 42:44.167
as you so keenly observed.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.845
Can't I steal just one life?

42:55.320 --> 42:57.288
Well, we'll see about you.

43:07.320 --> 43:11.006

PETER: Some locals found me
while they were digging up clams.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.728

from orphanage to orphanage.

43:30.680 --> 43:33.524
PETER:
I danced and sang in the streets for coins.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.690

I lived with two girls for a while.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.204

- Two.

And then Pearly scooped me up.

43:49.360 --> 43:52.045
He said I had talent.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.889
Actually, this isn't helping.

44:15.080 --> 44:16.650
Can you hear your heart?

44:19.240 --> 44:22.403
When the fever comes,
it's about the only thing I can hear.

44:22.920 --> 44:27.369
When you crack your first safe, your heart
beats so loud you can't hear the tumblers.

44:27.880 --> 44:32.488
You have to learn to quieten it, slow it
down, so you can work between the beats.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.083
The trick to it is lists.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.489
Meaningless words...

44:37.800 --> 44:40.690
you say, as you exhale
to slow down the breath.

44:42.640 --> 44:44.404
Inhale quietly...

44:44.680 --> 44:47.524
exhale and say the words
until the breath is gone.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.442
- Got it?
- I think so.
