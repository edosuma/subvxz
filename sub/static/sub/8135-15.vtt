WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:02.992
I gotta get some sleep.
I'm running a race tomorrow.

00:03.069 --> 00:04.934
What if I give you
a reason to stay up?

00:09.275 --> 00:11.505
KITT could win this race with
one booster tied behind his back.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.876
Your job is not
to win the race.

00:14.914 --> 00:18.350
- I believe we're being shot at, Michael.
- Accidents are a part of any race.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.352
Here's to good sportsmanship.

00:22.255 --> 00:26.692
Our saboteur may be planning a few new
surprises for the last leg of the race.

00:41.708 --> 00:46.805
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.905
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.800
Hi, Bonnie.
Hear Devon's got us in a race.

02:48.868 --> 02:50.859
I've augmented
KITT's scanning system...

02:50.937 --> 02:53.701
with a special infrared
tracking scope. Terrific.

02:53.773 --> 02:57.971
Um, listen. When you finish up work tonight, how
about you and I going out for a little dinner?

02:58.044 --> 03:00.740
I'd love to, Michael, but I'm
spending the night with KITT.

03:00.813 --> 03:04.840
Oh, well, you two
have a real good time.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.216
First I have to
recharge his components.

03:07.287 --> 03:10.085
Then I have to convert the engine
to run on liquid hydrogen.

03:10.156 --> 03:13.683
Then I have to flush his
systems and adjust his timing.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.228
Recharge his components?
Flush his system?

03:16.296 --> 03:18.787
KITT, don't you dare take
advantage of her tonight.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.730
I won't.

03:21.768 --> 03:26.205
Would you get out of here,
you yo-yo?

03:26.272 --> 03:29.764
KITT, I hope you're not picking
up his warped sense of humor.

03:29.842 --> 03:33.209
- I'm trying my best not to.
- Good.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.748
KITT!
Try a little harder.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.754
That driver was very lucky
to walk away from the trial heat.

03:43.823 --> 03:45.757
Devon, are you sure
it wasn't an accident?

03:45.825 --> 03:49.158
Michael, it looks like somebody's out
to sabotage the Alternative 2000 race.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.697
Well, quarter million dollar purse...
That could be an incentive.

03:51.764 --> 03:54.494
Absolutely right, Michael.
However, our goal...

03:54.567 --> 03:57.297
is to ensure
that no further disruptions occur.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.497
Therefore, you have joined the field
as my personal entry.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.938
Your job is not
to win the race.

04:02.008 --> 04:04.568
It is to find out
if indeed there is a saboteur.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.408
And if there is,
to put him out of business.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.418
Michael, I can serve you better
if I'm familiar with your strategy.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.421
Good point, KITT.

04:16.488 --> 04:19.219
Our game plan
is simple, yet complex.

04:19.291 --> 04:23.023
We lay low. We blend in with the
other racers on and off the course.

04:23.096 --> 04:27.465
We observe, deduce and analyze.

04:27.533 --> 04:30.024
In other words,
we're winging it, as usual.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.004
You got it.

04:39.178 --> 04:42.739
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
a great day for the auto industry...

04:42.815 --> 04:46.649
the first international grand prix
to compare alternative energy sources.

04:46.719 --> 04:51.053
Drivers from all over the world are here, and
you can positively feel the excitement mounting.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.422
Not only are these cars
fuel efficient,

04:53.493 --> 04:57.122
but their performance reflects
state-of-the-art auto engineering.

04:58.398 --> 05:02.061
Michael, I want you to meet
Dr. Kempler.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.194
Michael, it's nice
to meet you.

05:04.270 --> 05:07.535
Dr. Kempler, it's a pleasure. I
promise you. I'll do what I can to help.

05:07.607 --> 05:10.974
Thank you. I appreciate it. I can't
tell you how important all of this is.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.377
The entire credibility of alternative
energy research and development...

05:14.447 --> 05:16.381
lies on this race.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.907
- Oh, Devon, I still have to get your signature on the entry form.
- Certainly.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.510
Excuse me.
Nice meeting you.

05:21.587 --> 05:23.646
Nice meeting you too.
Catch you later.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.992
- Hi.
- Nice car.

05:29.062 --> 05:32.054
- You must be the late entry. I'm Liberty Cox.
- Michael Knight.

05:32.131 --> 05:34.656
Will all drivers please
report to the main tent.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.827
All drivers to the main tent.
Thank you.

05:36.903 --> 05:41.169
- I'll be your personal escort.
- I can't think of a nicer way to start a race.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.174
You know, you win,
uh, first prize...

05:43.242 --> 05:46.234
for the, uh, wildest dashboard
on a car.

05:46.312 --> 05:49.110
No kidding?
Where do I pick it up?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.946
I don't know.
I'll find out and let you know.

05:55.922 --> 05:59.050
Hello. I'm driving for Devon
Miles. You're Michael Knight.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.525
Yes, sir.
Ed Shaw, race coordinator.

06:01.594 --> 06:04.427
Interesting car. Yeah, well,
it's an interesting race.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.431
Best of luck.
Thank you.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.865
Uh, where do you think you're
going? I beg your pardon?

06:08.935 --> 06:11.927
- This meeting's for drivers only.
- Do you happen to know who I am?

06:12.004 --> 06:14.802
I sure do, lady.
That's why you stay right out here.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.001
Catch you later.

06:51.477 --> 06:55.470
Now, remember, you'll be clocked at
each of the two overnight pit stops.

06:55.548 --> 06:59.314
The first day, each car will be handicapped
according to his starting position...

06:59.385 --> 07:02.149
and his own specifications.

07:02.221 --> 07:06.157
Next two days will be a flat-out race
for the flags... 2,000 miles overall.

07:06.225 --> 07:09.991
Dr. Kempler and I have designed
the course to challenge you.

07:10.062 --> 07:13.190
Not each road is gonna be
in top-flight condition.

07:13.266 --> 07:17.100
I know what's at stake,
but let's be careful out there.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.367
In case you haven't noticed, we have
a new driver. Meet Michael Knight.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.603
That's it, gentlemen, ladies.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.667
Uh, Ed, just a second.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.578
Before you go, I would
like to introduce Clark Sellers,

07:28.648 --> 07:31.242
President of the Sellers
Cable Network.

07:31.317 --> 07:36.118
If it weren't for his generous contribution,
you would be racing for a lot less than $200,000.

07:36.189 --> 07:41.183
- Clark?
Yeah, about $195,000 less.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.387
No, that isn't true.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.488
The truth is
I consider that a bargain...

07:45.565 --> 07:49.331
to get the exclusive worldwide
television rights to this race.

07:49.402 --> 07:53.463
I think it's going to be an exciting
event, and the Sellers Cable Network...

07:53.539 --> 07:56.030
is proud to be
broadcasting it.

07:56.108 --> 07:59.475
Now, go out there
and show the world the future...

07:59.545 --> 08:02.378
is alternative energy...
And cable television.

08:02.448 --> 08:05.144
That's all.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.293
Hi, guys.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.356
Good luck.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.438
Hi.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.538
I'm Michael Knight,
the new driver.

08:35.615 --> 08:38.846
Before you go any further,
I think you should know...

08:38.918 --> 08:41.409
I have no intention
of making friends.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.421
I'm interested in two things...

08:43.489 --> 08:46.424
finishing first
and doing so in one piece.

08:46.492 --> 08:50.622
- So if you don't mind...
- In that case, I'll see you at the finish line.

08:52.798 --> 08:55.665
She wasn't your type anyway.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.636
Who are you, anyway?
I told you already. I'm Liberty...

08:58.704 --> 09:02.367
I know. Liberty Cox. But I mean, what are
you doing trying to crash a drivers' meeting?

09:02.441 --> 09:05.638
Oh, I'm covering the race for
New Wheels magazine. Ever read it?

09:05.711 --> 09:08.145
New Wheels?
Yeah, yeah, once or twice.

09:08.214 --> 09:12.173
Actually, I really want to experience the
race. I want to live it and breathe it...

09:12.251 --> 09:15.015
You mean, like, gonzo
journalism in the flesh.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.078
I guess you could say that.

09:17.156 --> 09:20.250
Listen, if you like, I could run
the first leg of the race with you.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.817
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I travel solo.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.557
Hey, lovely lady.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.895
How would you like to ride
in the lead car?

09:27.967 --> 09:30.333
No thanks, boys. Come
on there, magazine lady.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.167
You have absolutely no idea
what you're gonna be missing.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.469
True. It's true.
Come on.

09:37.543 --> 09:40.671
Would you believe their car is supposed
to run on moonshine? No kidding?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.976
Looks like they're halfway through
their fuel supply.

09:45.918 --> 09:49.479
- Get out of the way, you fool.
- Who are you calling a fool, schnitzel breath?

09:49.555 --> 09:51.546
That boy's driving illegally.
I'm calling you a fool.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.990
You know, you're a little...

09:58.598 --> 10:00.657
I'll see ya at the pit stop.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.702
Could we have the racing cars
to the starting bridge.

10:08.874 --> 10:11.240
All cars to the starting bridge, please.

10:23.322 --> 10:27.122
Ladies and gentlemen, in car number
one, fueled by an alcohol-based mixture,

10:27.193 --> 10:30.060
Sonny and Lester Prince.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.654
In car number two,
driving what might be...

10:32.732 --> 10:35.394
the most advanced methane-powered
automobile in the world,

10:35.468 --> 10:37.993
from West Germany,
Helmut Gras.

10:42.008 --> 10:46.035
In the third car, from Japan,
running on propane, Hito Osaka.

10:48.547 --> 10:52.313
In the solar-powered vehicle,
we have Dorothy Ackridge.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.719
- Next up, from the sheikdom of Kuwait...
- Ready, KITT?

10:57.790 --> 11:01.521
Michael, you do realize this race is
academic, not to mention unnecessary.

11:01.594 --> 11:05.724
- Why is that?
- The car of the future is already here... me.

11:07.667 --> 11:12.400
And finally, running on liquid
hydrogen, in the K-2000 Special,

11:12.471 --> 11:15.998
Michael Knight. That's our
little secret, pal. Let's do it!

11:17.410 --> 11:22.109
The starter is lining up the cars.
Just look at those beauties...

11:22.181 --> 11:25.514
the newest and fastest
alternative-energy cars in the world.

11:25.584 --> 11:28.144
And remember...
The challenge is to win the race...

11:28.220 --> 11:30.814
using the least amount of fuel.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.557
The drivers all seem to be okay.
The cars are ready.

11:56.982 --> 11:59.246
The starter raises the green flag.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.481
And they're racing!

13:39.618 --> 13:42.018
Looks like these guys
are playing for keeps.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.164
Michael, why do you have
my engine on half-throttle?

13:57.236 --> 14:01.229
We got to blend in, KITT.
You know that. Ah, yes.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.434
Observe, deduce, analyze.

14:03.509 --> 14:08.139
You got it. We're under strict orders
not to strut our stuff.

14:08.214 --> 14:11.342
Listen, check your data banks and give
me a rundown on the competition, will ya?

14:11.417 --> 14:14.011
As you wish, Michael.
Beginning with the letter "A,"

14:14.086 --> 14:16.850
there's Dorothy Ackridge,
the woman you attempted to pick up.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.390
I was just trying to be friendly.

14:19.458 --> 14:23.690
I've heard that before.
She's the daughter of Henry Ackridge.

14:23.762 --> 14:26.230
No kidding?
President of Ackridge Automotive.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.528
Incorporated.
Hmm.

14:28.601 --> 14:32.799
Kinda makes you wonder why
she's driving a solar-powered car.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.204
You got a reading on her
on the tracking scope?

14:35.274 --> 14:39.210
She's approximately half a mile
behind us. I'll decrease speed.

14:39.278 --> 14:44.215
I appreciate that, partner. I know how tough
this is on your competitive sensibilities.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.901
- KITT, what was that?
- I believe we're being shot at, Michael.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.415
There's been another shot
behind us.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.465
The solar car's been hit.
Michael, she's skidding out of control.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.002
She's okay. Zoom in on her.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.140
This is terrific. This is better than
The French Connection, and it's for real.

16:18.877 --> 16:22.176
Come on. Take it easy.

16:22.247 --> 16:25.148
You okay?
I think so.

16:25.217 --> 16:27.708
I'll let you know
after I stop shaking.

16:27.786 --> 16:31.415
Thank you. The way I treated you
before, you're very kind.

16:31.490 --> 16:35.586
You'd do the same for me. Hang on.
I want to take a look at that tire.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.694
Ladies and gentlemen,
the cars are coming into view now.

17:09.762 --> 17:14.199
Yes, here are the early finishers of the first
leg. I see Michael Knight's K-2000 Special.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.359
We're awaiting word now of
Dorothy Ackridge, Excuse me.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.369
Whose car apparently
sustained a blowout.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.702
There she is now,
and she seems to be all right.

17:21.773 --> 17:24.402
I'm all right. I'm really
more concerned about my car!

17:24.476 --> 17:27.069
Your crew's working on it. They'll
have you back in the race tomorrow.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.137
Don't worry about a thing.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.978
As soon as she comes out, I want
some quotes to go with the footage.

17:35.487 --> 17:38.320
Looks like a Fellini movie.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.756
How's KITT holding up?
Like a champ.

17:40.826 --> 17:43.693
You might check out
his grappling winch.

17:43.762 --> 17:46.697
And while you're at it,

17:46.765 --> 17:48.756
check out this.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.074
Hi, Liberty.
Another interview.

17:57.142 --> 18:00.168
Go for it. Hi, guys.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.805
We've reserved you a seat
right here. I bet you did.

18:02.881 --> 18:05.281
Come on, here.
Oh, yeah.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.978
Step right on in here.

18:08.053 --> 18:11.511
Gonna fix you right up. What you
want, darling? You want a beer?

18:11.590 --> 18:15.117
Ah, you have to be disappointed
with your time today.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.560
Well, guys, I only worry
about one thing...

18:17.629 --> 18:19.688
that's who crosses the finish line first.

18:20.899 --> 18:25.359
Sure you'd have finished sooner if you
hadn't stopped to help poor Miss Ackridge.

18:25.437 --> 18:29.806
- We know you would have never stopped to help her.
- Accidents are a part of any race.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.105
Question is
will it continue to happen?

18:32.177 --> 18:34.805
They will, the way he drives.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.815
Well, here's to good sportsmanship.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.116
That's what I figured.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.991
Now, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me ask you a question.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.497
What is it with all these questions?
I thought you wanted to party.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.556
Wrong.
Wrong?

18:55.634 --> 18:59.468
Give you a little acupressure. No,
no, no, no. Listen. Listen, you guys.

18:59.538 --> 19:02.473
I would really love to stay.
Really, I would.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.840
But I think that you two
are so unbelievably sexy...

19:05.911 --> 19:09.403
that I don't think I can control myself
much longer. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.415
I haven't finished
your kidneys yet.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.475
Boy, you got a way with women,
Sonny. I got to hand it to you.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.680
I told you she had
the hots for us.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.689
Our mother raised an idiot,
and it ain't me.

19:18.757 --> 19:21.453
That girl ain't got the hots for us, or
she wouldn't be going over there toward him.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.825
Uh-huh.

19:25.764 --> 19:30.098
It is cold out there!
Well, come on inside.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.502
You know, you seem very calm...

19:33.572 --> 19:36.735
for a man who may be
the next one to go.

19:36.808 --> 19:39.072
What makes you think
there'll be a next one?

19:39.144 --> 19:41.408
Call it a journalistic hunch.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.780
But there's someone who wants to win
this race by whatever means it takes.

19:45.851 --> 19:49.218
Like, by eliminating
the competition.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.756
I can't believe all this
is happening.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.916
Two years of planning,

19:53.992 --> 19:57.257
coordinating, finding sponsors
for the cars, developing fuels...

19:57.329 --> 19:59.524
Gordon, try to relax.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.998
Take a deep breath.
Have a drink.

20:02.067 --> 20:05.195
We'll work it out.
You're not in this alone, you know.

20:05.270 --> 20:09.673
One way or another, your Alternative
2000 will succeed. Believe me.

20:11.843 --> 20:15.006
Dr. Kempler, could I see you
for a minute? Alone?

20:15.080 --> 20:17.913
Ed, you know I don't have any
secrets from Devon. What is it?

20:17.983 --> 20:21.009
In that case, I think you
better come with me, both of you.

20:26.692 --> 20:29.058
Looks like something's up.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.227
You can go now.

20:33.298 --> 20:37.496
She said she found this under the
bed when she was cleaning the room.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.902
Uh, senora.
Uno momento, por favor.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.840
A collapsible Rexman.

20:43.909 --> 20:47.037
A highly sophisticated
long-range sniper's rifle.

20:47.112 --> 20:50.309
Not at all common.
Snipers?

20:50.382 --> 20:54.716
Devon, do you think that this could be
the rifle that shot at Dorothy's car?

20:54.786 --> 20:57.584
Bonnie said the bullet
was a .308 caliber,

20:57.656 --> 21:00.454
and the Rexman uses .308s.

21:03.362 --> 21:08.459
What's the meaning of this?

21:08.533 --> 21:11.195
- What are you doing in my room?
- I believe the question should be,

21:11.270 --> 21:13.670
"What is that doing
in your room?"

21:25.417 --> 21:28.045
Well, you can breathe
easy again. The ordeal's over.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.520
Naturally, my hunch
was right on target.

21:30.589 --> 21:33.251
- Am I in the wrong room?
- No, no. You're in the right room.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.885
Anyway, um, as it turns out,

21:35.961 --> 21:39.362
it was the Arab; although, I
thought it might be the German.

21:39.431 --> 21:43.458
Anyway, I guess the crisis is over. They
did find the smoking gun in his room.

21:43.535 --> 21:46.470
If I'm in the right room,
then you're in the wrong room.

21:46.538 --> 21:50.201
I... I thought I'd surprise you.
I hope you don't mind.

21:50.275 --> 21:52.573
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.341
Well, I-I-I was just being
spontaneous. I figured this gave me...

21:56.415 --> 21:59.942
a good opportunity to find out
what makes a man like you tick.

22:00.018 --> 22:03.818
Yeah, well, I don't think your
readers would be real interested in me.

22:03.889 --> 22:07.723
I don't care about my readers.
I find you very interesting.

22:09.227 --> 22:11.695
Are you gonna stay mad
at me all night?

22:11.763 --> 22:15.494
No, I-I wasn't planning on it, but...

22:15.567 --> 22:18.900
Liberty, I-I gotta get some
sleep. I'm running a race tomorrow.

22:18.970 --> 22:22.565
What if I give you
a good reason to stay up?

22:36.855 --> 22:39.415
Is that reason enough?

22:39.491 --> 22:41.516
No.

22:41.593 --> 22:43.720
But it's a start.

22:45.297 --> 22:49.495
This is an outrage. I've never
seen that rifle before in my life.

22:49.568 --> 22:52.435
You can't do this to me.
I'm warning you.

22:52.504 --> 22:55.200
If I'm jailed, my country
will lodge a formal protest.

23:00.312 --> 23:05.409
Well, we can all finally breathe
a sigh of relief. Hah! I hope so.

23:05.484 --> 23:08.647
All this craziness is making me
a nervous wreck.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.052
You can relax now, I think.

23:11.123 --> 23:14.058
I feel certain the case is closed.

23:49.361 --> 23:54.321
The police did the ballistics tests on
the rifle and the bullet, and they matched.

23:54.399 --> 23:57.596
That still doesn't mean Hashi
pulled the trigger. No, it doesn't.

23:57.669 --> 24:00.297
Just because he was driving
doesn't mean he didn't either.

24:00.372 --> 24:03.500
He could've left the road,
assembled the rifle, fired,

24:03.575 --> 24:05.975
and in the confusion,
got back into the race.

24:06.044 --> 24:10.606
Remember, he comes from one of the major
petroleum exporting countries in the world.

24:10.682 --> 24:15.210
Devon, it's...
It's too perfect, you know?

24:15.287 --> 24:18.120
I think I should stay in the race
until we're sure all the shoes have dropped.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.215
You sure it isn't
because you want to win?

24:20.292 --> 24:24.160
- Devon, don't you know me?
- Yes. That's why I asked.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.541
Michael.
Morning.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.839
It is a glorious morning...
A double-header.

24:39.911 --> 24:43.972
Not only do I get to be with you, but I
get to ride in this mysterious black beauty.

24:44.049 --> 24:47.576
Listen, I've got everything arranged. I've
got chicken and sandwiches, iced tea...

24:47.652 --> 24:50.553
Liberty, I'm sorry. You
can't ride with me. What?

24:50.622 --> 24:54.752
It's not me. It's my sponsor, Devon
Miles. He's touchy about these things.

24:54.826 --> 24:58.057
I don't believe you!
Hey!

25:01.466 --> 25:03.696
Didn't last night mean
anything to you?

25:04.736 --> 25:07.705
I don't beg rides, Michael Knight.

25:07.772 --> 25:09.740
They beg me.

25:12.143 --> 25:15.010
Liberty...

25:16.181 --> 25:18.843
Come on, baby!

25:21.520 --> 25:23.454
Bonnie!

25:23.522 --> 25:26.685
I wanted to see if I could extend
the tracking scope's range. Did you?

25:26.758 --> 25:29.386
No, but I see
you extended yours.

25:35.333 --> 25:38.769
Ladies and gentlemen,
the cars are moving to the starting line...

25:38.837 --> 25:40.964
for the second leg
of this historic race.

26:12.571 --> 26:16.439
There's the green flag.
And we have a start.

26:50.575 --> 26:52.839
Busy morning?
You could say that.

26:52.911 --> 26:56.108
Did Liberty Cox ever find out
what makes you tick?

26:56.181 --> 26:59.480
KITT, didn't anyone ever tell you
it's not polite to eavesdrop?

26:59.551 --> 27:02.952
I had no choice. After all,
I was in surveillance mode.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.854
Then you should've noticed
she left and I went to bed.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.858
I've heard that one before.

27:42.827 --> 27:46.194
KITT, let's run profiles on the
remaining drivers and key personnel.

27:46.264 --> 27:49.427
Does the phrase "key personnel"
include Miss Liberty Cox?

27:49.501 --> 27:52.698
Yeah. That's a good idea.
Let's start with her.

27:52.771 --> 27:56.332
Shall we begin with personal data
or criminal activities?

27:56.408 --> 27:58.842
"Criminal activities"?
Come on.

27:58.910 --> 28:02.539
The lady may be many things,
but she's no criminal.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.082
- Is she?
- You tell me.

28:05.150 --> 28:09.280
June 1980. Breaking and entering.
Bailed out by her editor.

28:09.354 --> 28:12.380
September 1980.
Malicious mischief.

28:12.457 --> 28:14.584
Bailed out by her publisher.

28:14.659 --> 28:19.494
January 1981...

28:51.029 --> 28:53.259
It'll get your motor runnin',
that's for sure.

28:53.331 --> 28:56.425
You know, it's guys like you that give
alternative fuel supply a bad name.

28:56.501 --> 28:59.231
A bad name? Hell, lady, we love it.
Why don't you lighten up a little bit?

29:02.373 --> 29:06.139
We don't know,
but we sure can go! Whoo!

29:08.213 --> 29:12.172
Let me out of the car!

29:21.025 --> 29:24.119
Looks like Liberty bit off
a little bit more than she can chew.

29:35.907 --> 29:38.341
If you have any thoughts
of rescuing her, Michael,

29:38.409 --> 29:40.934
I'd advise you check
my schematic visuals.

29:42.380 --> 29:44.473
In that case, buddy,
we better step on it.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.657
My God!

30:03.735 --> 30:06.033
Whoo!

30:24.989 --> 30:27.184
I don't need
your charity, Michael.

30:35.934 --> 30:37.868
Oh, my God!

30:53.484 --> 30:56.942
Devon, I need a coroner's van
and a wrecker here right away.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.955
There's been another accident.

30:59.023 --> 31:02.254
- Michael, that was no accident.
- What are you talking about, KITT?

31:02.327 --> 31:04.955
My electronic sensors
picked up a detonation signal...

31:05.029 --> 31:07.759
two milliseconds
before the explosion.

31:10.935 --> 31:14.098
Is that all this is to you is
a hot picture and a cover story?

31:27.852 --> 31:31.015
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a report of a possible accident...

31:31.089 --> 31:34.650
to the number one car
driven by Sonny and Lester Prince.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.719
Meanwhile...

31:38.796 --> 31:40.730
What a disaster.

31:42.233 --> 31:46.932
Look at it. There isn't a sober
journalistic face to be seen.

31:47.005 --> 31:50.702
There isn't one
scientific quarterly writer.

31:50.775 --> 31:55.803
Whole thing has turned into a blood-and-guts
demolition derby. It's a car crash carnival.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.814
Well, Doctor, you aren't
thinking of canceling the race?

31:57.882 --> 31:59.816
I don't know
what else to do!

31:59.884 --> 32:01.875
Well, if you cancel now,
it'll be interpreted as...

32:01.953 --> 32:03.944
as the failure
of alternative energy.

32:04.022 --> 32:06.616
The entire concept will be
set back 10 years.

32:06.691 --> 32:09.182
Gentlemen, may I make
a suggestion?

32:09.260 --> 32:13.560
Since our primary concern
is the safety of the drivers,

32:13.631 --> 32:16.532
why not let them decide?

32:16.601 --> 32:21.800
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to thank you all for coming.

32:21.873 --> 32:26.742
As you can well imagine, there's been a considerable
amount of concern over what's been happening,

32:26.811 --> 32:29.279
and there seems to be
a variety of opinion...

32:29.347 --> 32:32.282
as to whether the race should be
allowed to continue or not.

32:32.350 --> 32:36.047
Uh, Devon Miles
has come up with...

32:36.120 --> 32:39.180
what I believe
to be the best solution.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.225
Since it's really your race,

32:41.292 --> 32:43.624
and it's certainly
your lives,

32:43.695 --> 32:46.687
he felt that you should be
the ones to decide...

32:46.764 --> 32:48.698
whether to continue or not.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.830
So, I'm going to ask...

32:52.904 --> 32:55.964
all of those who are
in favor of continuing the race...

32:56.040 --> 33:00.067
to please raise your hands.

33:06.951 --> 33:09.249
All right.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.982
The race will continue on schedule.

33:12.056 --> 33:15.890
All drivers report to the staging area
at 7:00 a.m. sharp,

33:15.960 --> 33:18.656
and, uh, good luck.

33:22.367 --> 33:26.394
We must talk. Let me
grab a quick shower first.

33:33.544 --> 33:36.809
Shaw, how can you act
like it's business as usual?

33:36.881 --> 33:38.849
You killed two people today.

33:38.916 --> 33:42.215
Lower your voice.
To hell with my voice!

33:42.286 --> 33:44.754
Look, I hired you to arrange
an accident or two.

33:44.822 --> 33:49.953
A near miss. Some excitement, so at
least I'd end up with a promotable show.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.394
Not death. Not murder.

33:52.463 --> 33:55.091
You know what's wrong
with guys like you, Sellers?

33:55.166 --> 33:57.999
You want accidents, explosions,
chills and thrills...

33:58.069 --> 34:00.401
so you can sell what would
have been a turkey...

34:00.471 --> 34:04.066
and keep your little
cable network alive.

34:04.142 --> 34:06.702
But you don't want any
of the responsibility.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.576
What was that?

34:14.185 --> 34:17.052
Aah!

34:34.105 --> 34:36.096
Hey, Liberty!

34:38.708 --> 34:40.699
You home?

35:05.503 --> 35:08.097
The girl can't just disappear
from the face of the earth.

35:08.172 --> 35:11.107
She won't just disappear.

35:11.175 --> 35:14.702
They'll find her... what's left of her...
At the site of the next accident.

35:14.779 --> 35:18.875
That's insane!
It's too risky.

35:18.950 --> 35:23.785
Just shut up and listen. They're
looking for a mystery saboteur, right?

35:23.855 --> 35:26.483
We'll give it to 'em...
A dead one.

35:26.557 --> 35:31.460
You think it's that easy?
You think the police are that stupid?

35:31.529 --> 35:34.498
I don't think we have
that many options.

35:34.565 --> 35:38.126
Now, she already has a history
with the local law enforcement.

35:38.202 --> 35:42.400
The police will come to the only conclusion
they can: She made a mistake setting a bomb.

35:48.179 --> 35:50.773
No doubt about it, Michael.
That is identical to the signal...

35:50.848 --> 35:54.545
I monitored two milliseconds
before the Prince brothers were, uh...

35:54.619 --> 35:57.452
What is the phrase?
Blown to smithereens.

35:57.522 --> 36:01.583
Well, Michael, it seems
we found our saboteur.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.923
Really?

36:03.995 --> 36:05.929
And who's she working for?

36:05.997 --> 36:10.127
Middle East? Detroit? The whole
thing doesn't track. Give me a motive.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.635
All right, Michael.
I'll give you a motive.

36:12.703 --> 36:16.730
And not one as byzantine
as ones we've considered.

36:16.807 --> 36:19.674
Look. At the start of this race,

36:19.744 --> 36:23.111
the only interested people
were idealists and dreamers.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.116
But now, in light of the events
of the past few days, it's news.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.950
Our Liberty has her camera bag
chock-full of negatives...

36:30.021 --> 36:33.923
which could command a fortune from
magazines and newspapers all over the world.

36:33.991 --> 36:37.950
It's too easy. It's the
Hashi-with-the-rifle thing all over again.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.988
I mean, her bed wasn't slept in.
Why weren't her bags unpacked?

36:42.066 --> 36:44.398
Where'd she go?

36:44.468 --> 36:47.335
The racers are lining up.

36:48.973 --> 36:51.942
Michael, if Liberty is
not in the wrong,

36:52.009 --> 36:56.844
our saboteur may be planning a few new
surprises for the last day of the race.

36:56.914 --> 36:59.144
I think you'd better go.
Why?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.651
So you can put an A.P.B. out
on Liberty after I leave?

37:01.719 --> 37:04.244
What would you do?

37:04.322 --> 37:06.313
Same thing.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.616
Good luck.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.721
Be careful, Michael.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.091
Thanks, Bonnie.

37:42.493 --> 37:44.484
All right.
Okay?

37:46.564 --> 37:50.159
Now, don't make it
any harder.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.931
Got her?
Yeah.

37:54.005 --> 37:56.633
Oh, you've got
a lot of energy.

37:56.707 --> 37:59.437
If I get some time,
I'll help you work it off.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.717
Give me that bag.

38:15.793 --> 38:18.557
Thanks. I'm gonna set this
with a fuse.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.824
Now tie her to the rock.
All right.

38:20.898 --> 38:24.732
When the dust settles, they'll
figure that she made a mistake,

38:24.802 --> 38:27.464
couldn't get out of
the blast area in time.

38:27.538 --> 38:31.030
We'll have to hurry. I told the
camera crew to get some run-bys, but...

38:31.108 --> 38:33.167
they should be here...
10 minutes.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.178
Twenty.
I took care of that.

38:35.246 --> 38:39.012
You took care of it?
Who the hell do you think you are?

38:39.083 --> 38:42.575
The new vice president
of Sellers Cable Network.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.451
"Vice president"?

38:47.058 --> 38:49.026
Come on.

39:10.948 --> 39:15.112
No, please?

39:16.921 --> 39:18.912
Ow!

39:59.029 --> 40:03.329
KITT, I know we have missed something.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.928
Run the stats on the rest of the race... The
race course... Just give me everything you got.

40:07.004 --> 40:09.097
Very well.

40:13.577 --> 40:17.513
Help!

40:17.581 --> 40:19.515
Help!

40:25.990 --> 40:29.687
KITT, I think you made a mistake.
There's only been three accidents, not...

40:29.760 --> 40:34.356
Michael, I was about to say that this is a
readout of all the S.C.N. camera positions.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.026
Yeah, but this one,
this one and this one...

40:37.101 --> 40:39.831
They all took place in the same
place the accidents happened.

40:39.904 --> 40:42.896
You know, that's why I thought...

40:42.973 --> 40:47.842
Wait a minute. Give me an overlay of the
accident sites and leave up the camera positions.

40:47.912 --> 40:50.073
Right away.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.213
KITT,

40:54.285 --> 40:57.812
every accident has taken place
right in front of a camera crew.

40:57.888 --> 41:01.085
Michael, the odds against a freak accident
being synchronistic...

41:01.158 --> 41:03.353
with a random deployment
of cameras is...

41:03.427 --> 41:06.794
I know what it is...
It's way too coincidental.

41:06.864 --> 41:10.300
Remember what Devon said about why
Liberty might have sabotaged the race?

41:10.367 --> 41:13.928
- To make her feel more valuable?
- Well, the same theory applies...

41:14.004 --> 41:17.303
to cosponsor Clark Sellers.

41:17.374 --> 41:19.535
Exploitive publicity.

41:19.610 --> 41:21.544
Where's the nearest
camera position?

41:21.612 --> 41:23.739
We just passed it... Apache Wash.

41:39.730 --> 41:42.631
KITT, get me a readout
on that canyon.

41:42.700 --> 41:46.693
With all your scanners, the visuals, the
chemical detectors... Give me the works, buddy.

41:46.770 --> 41:50.536
Michael, there's
an explosive charge there.

41:50.608 --> 41:53.509
And a person too.
What?

41:53.577 --> 41:55.511
Come on.
Give me maximum enlargement.

41:57.982 --> 42:00.280
KITT, it's Liberty!

42:00.351 --> 42:04.117
Michael, at the rate that fuse is burning,
we have less than 20 seconds to stop it.

42:15.766 --> 42:18.667
Help! Oh!

42:21.539 --> 42:25.100
Help! Help me!

42:33.450 --> 42:36.442
KITT, I need some help!

43:12.423 --> 43:15.415
Michael, I'm monitoring the signal
from the S.C.N. Cameras.

43:15.492 --> 43:18.825
Yeah, it talks.

43:19.964 --> 43:22.091
Yeah, I know.
It's got monitors too, huh?

43:22.166 --> 43:25.761
Clark Sellers is there.

43:25.836 --> 43:28.930
Liberty, I know
Sellers is in on it.

43:29.006 --> 43:32.999
What? Shaw?

43:33.077 --> 43:35.307
You're telling me Shaw's
in on it too? Mm-hmm!

43:35.379 --> 43:39.247
All right, KITT. Sellers and Shaw are
gonna take off the minute they see us.

43:39.316 --> 43:42.183
Get me some overdrive, buddy!

43:44.989 --> 43:47.457
Huh?

43:47.524 --> 43:50.391
What?

43:50.461 --> 43:53.362
Michael, she would like you
to take the gag off.

43:53.430 --> 43:57.389
Oh.
I don't think so.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.800
You know, this is the first
conversation I've ever had with you...

43:59.870 --> 44:01.804
where I can get
a word in edgewise?

44:03.474 --> 44:05.408
All right, KITT.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.808
We're gonna give Clark Sellers
a real big finish...

44:07.878 --> 44:09.812
for his cameras.

44:15.753 --> 44:19.154
The cars are coming into view,
and it looks like Helmut Gras.

44:19.223 --> 44:24.559
No, wait a minute. Another car is
coming, and his speed is off the scale!

44:24.628 --> 44:26.823
He's got the girl.

44:31.402 --> 44:35.065
And the winner is Michael Knight.
Coming in second is Helmut Gras.

44:35.139 --> 44:37.300
And third, Hito Osaka.

44:39.777 --> 44:43.110
Come on, come on!
Let's go!

44:43.180 --> 44:45.580
Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen.
The race is over,

44:45.649 --> 44:48.379
but there seems to be some kind
of a disturbance in the pit area.

44:48.452 --> 44:51.717
Please don't panic.
Please stay in your seats.

45:06.136 --> 45:08.604
Michael, they're getting away.

45:27.357 --> 45:29.348
Ouch!

45:50.981 --> 45:52.949
Mr. Sellers?

45:53.016 --> 45:54.984
Say "Leavenworth."

46:03.260 --> 46:05.820
Ready? Okay, smile.

46:05.896 --> 46:08.922
All right! Great!

46:08.999 --> 46:11.467
Just... Let me turn this
just a little bit this way.

46:11.535 --> 46:13.628
Okay.
Okay. Yeah.

46:13.704 --> 46:15.831
That looks pretty good.

46:15.906 --> 46:18.534
Okay. Just one more.
How about that? Okay?

46:18.609 --> 46:21.976
Ready.
Ready? Say "cheese."

46:26.150 --> 46:28.084
Hello? Why, no. It's Bonnie.

46:28.152 --> 46:30.382
Oh, hi, Dr. Kempler.
What do you think, Devon?

46:31.922 --> 46:35.323
It goes against the grain to see
a man rewarded for insubordination.

46:35.392 --> 46:38.987
Can you run that by me one more
time? I'm not sure I heard you right.

46:39.062 --> 46:42.498
Okay, Devon, I'm sorry.
I apologize for winning the race.

46:42.566 --> 46:44.898
But how else was I supposed
to nail Sellers and Shaw?

46:44.968 --> 46:48.131
I have no intention of
discussing this case ever again.

46:48.205 --> 46:50.673
Now, would you please tell me
what she's doing here?

46:50.741 --> 46:53.733
I'm here because I want to find
out what you told my editor.

46:53.811 --> 46:57.178
I had the world's greatest
racing scoop.

46:57.247 --> 46:59.841
Death, mayhem,
a talking car to the rescue.

46:59.917 --> 47:03.478
I simply told him that we're
involved in a sensitive area here,

47:03.554 --> 47:05.988
and that publicity is something
we could well do without.

47:06.056 --> 47:09.025
Explains why he killed my story.

47:09.092 --> 47:11.151
- It's alive again.
- What?

47:11.228 --> 47:15.324
Well, it seems that Hashi Al Qatar's
ambassador called the state department,

47:15.399 --> 47:17.993
and they agreed that
the disqualification was illegal.

47:18.068 --> 47:21.560
Does that mean that... The race
will have to be run all over again?

47:21.638 --> 47:23.606
Does that mean I'll have to
give back my trophy?

47:23.674 --> 47:26.268
- It looks like that.
- Oh, what a shame!

47:26.343 --> 47:29.744
- Sic transit gloria mundi.
- You took the words right out of my mouth.

47:29.813 --> 47:31.747
Uh, hold on a minute.
I'll ask him.

47:31.815 --> 47:34.443
Um, Dr. Kempler wants to know if
Michael's entering the race again.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.486
- Yes!
- No!

47:56.340 --> 48:00.299
Michael Knight, a lone crusader
in a dangerous world,

48:00.377 --> 48:03.369
the world of the Knight Rider.
