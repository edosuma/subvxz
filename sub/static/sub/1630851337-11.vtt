00:06.306 --> 00:08.575
This season,
we have a huge mega mentor,

00:08.575 --> 00:11.044
possibly my favorite
that's ever come on this show.

00:11.044 --> 00:13.180
My artists are gonna lose
their mind.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.615
Who do you think
it could be?
I have no idea.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.683
Mega mentors.
My mind is spinning.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.519
I know it's gonna be big.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.487
He is
a brilliant artist,

00:20.487 --> 00:21.722
performer, and musician.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.626
‐Oh, my God.
‐Oh, my la‐‐

00:25.626 --> 00:28.228
He's written songs that
the whole world loves to sing.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.097
Oh, shoot!
Holy cow.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.498
Yes, sir!
I love you!

00:31.498 --> 00:35.669
This season's mega mentor
is none other than Ed Sheeran.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.172
♪ I'm on my way

00:38.172 --> 00:40.374
One of the great
singer‐songwriters

00:40.374 --> 00:43.043
on the planet.
So many awards.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.545
He's an incredible
performer.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.381
He's a guy that actually
builds a track on stage.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.517
Ed Sheeran is probably
one of the A Team.

00:52.252 --> 00:56.356
He is one of the most
streamed artists of our time.

00:56.356 --> 01:01.595
He just fell from the heavens
and landed here

01:01.595 --> 01:03.664
on the set of "The Voice."

01:03.664 --> 01:05.098
Hey.
Holy crap!

01:05.098 --> 01:06.200
That's Ed Sheeran.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.501
What's going on?
What's up, man?

01:07.501 --> 01:09.703
Ed Sheeran has pretty much
accomplished it all.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.706
He's producer. He's won
any award you can think of.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.508
'Cause our dressing rooms
are right next to each other,

01:14.508 --> 01:17.244
did you hear me performing
"Sweet Caroline"?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.213
I did, yeah.
I was really wanting you

01:19.213 --> 01:21.348
to critique my version,

01:21.348 --> 01:23.283
like,
from a mentor standpoint.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.052
It sounded beautiful, yeah.
It did?

01:25.052 --> 01:26.286
But you are
a professional singer,

01:26.286 --> 01:28.422
so I would expect it
to sound great.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.457
Depends.
Ed's a perfect mentor.

01:30.457 --> 01:33.093
He's written songs
for so many different genres.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.195
He can really tackle anything.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.630
Blake ‐‐ I've met him
a bunch of times,

01:36.630 --> 01:38.365
but I've never actually spent
this much time with him,

01:38.365 --> 01:40.267
so I'm very grateful for that.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.202
Thank you for being here,
Ed.

01:42.202 --> 01:43.604
I'm really happy
to be here.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.339
Being a mega mentor is perfect

01:45.339 --> 01:47.207
'cause you get to give
constructive criticism.

01:47.207 --> 01:49.309
I've performed
all around the world

01:49.309 --> 01:51.278
on different "Voice" things,
but never really done,

01:51.278 --> 01:53.113

01:53.113 --> 01:54.348
Who do you think
it's gonna be?

01:54.348 --> 01:56.350
I feel like it's gonna be
somebody really big.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.219
They're gonna be amazing
no matter what.
They're gonna be amazing.

01:59.219 --> 02:03.223
This is like my two
powerhouse vocalists.

02:03.223 --> 02:06.727
Jonathan is actually someone
I just stole.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.328
That is a steal!

02:08.328 --> 02:10.731
You're not leaving.
What are you talking about?

02:10.731 --> 02:13.367
And then Wendy's been
on my team since the beginning.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.402
The big shocker
is that Wendy chose me

02:15.402 --> 02:17.337
to be her coach
to begin with.

02:17.337 --> 02:18.539
She obviously watched
the show

02:18.539 --> 02:20.040
and knows
you've won it eight times.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.409
Maybe so.
She's a Nashville girl.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.711
Come on in and meet Ed Sheeran,
you guys.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.713
Oh, my.
How you guys doing?

02:26.713 --> 02:28.448
Oh, wow.

02:28.448 --> 02:33.153
Ed Sheeran ‐‐ he's worked
in country, pop, and soul. Wow.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.156
That's exactly
what I've been building

02:36.156 --> 02:38.192
these last 35 years.
Oh, my gosh. How are you?

02:38.192 --> 02:40.027
I hear
you're a Nashville girl.
Yes, I am.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.195
I lived in Nashville
for quite some time.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.629
Yeah, you did.
I'm still there.

02:42.629 --> 02:44.665
I'm really looking forward
to hearing you guys sing.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.233
This is gonna be exciting.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.268
I got something
I got to tell you.
What?

02:48.268 --> 02:50.304
I've been a member
of The Time Jumpers

02:50.304 --> 02:52.706
for two years.
I didn't know that.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.142
♪ Your kiss

02:55.142 --> 02:58.045
The Time Jumpers
are a Grammy Award‐winning band.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.613
It's traditional country music,

02:59.613 --> 03:03.050
and they're like some of
the best musicians

03:03.050 --> 03:04.585
in Nashville music history.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.721
And so it was big news that
they invited me to be a member.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.724
The Time Jumpers never heard me
sing soul music.

03:10.724 --> 03:13.193
So you're going
from Time Jumpers,

03:13.193 --> 03:14.461

"Ain't No Way" is the song
I'm singing,

03:23.637 --> 03:27.074
but I grew up watching
"Hee Haw" and "Soul Train."

Me too.
Right.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.477
I grew up watching

Very different.
Really? What about
"The Benny Hill Show"?

You're English.
Dude, I feel like Americans

03:34.681 --> 03:37.351

drink tea and know the Queen.

At eight years old,
I didn't understand the words,

You stole me
from Mr. Legend.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.238
Okay, yeah. The coaches
quickly fade from my memory

This song,
it's pretty emotional for me

05:14.214 --> 05:16.350
because when I went through
stage 4 cancer...

05:16.350 --> 05:19.286
Bloody hell.

Jonathan, Wendy,
are you okay?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.035
Yeah.
Am I alive?

12:16.203 --> 12:19.039
Jonathan, thank you
for letting us enjoy

12:19.039 --> 12:22.576
that amazingly infectious
interpretation.

12:22.576 --> 12:26.213
I want your version.
You sound unbelievable.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.714
There's too much talent
this season,

12:27.714 --> 12:29.183
and it's
really overwhelming.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.318
Wendy, where do we begin,
you know?

12:31.318 --> 12:35.189
As you float in
in your cloak yet again,

12:35.189 --> 12:38.225
sporting this incredibly
regal neckpiece.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.494
How do you honor
an Aretha Franklin song

12:40.494 --> 12:43.197
and yet breathe
so much new life into it?

12:43.197 --> 12:46.099
You just absolutely blew it
out of the water.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.302
I think I would have to
give it to Wendy,

12:48.302 --> 12:50.070
but I love you both so much.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.405
Wow, what a way
to start the day.

12:51.405 --> 12:53.240
Thank you. Oh, my God.

12:53.240 --> 12:57.211
Jonathan, it was full
of heart and joy.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.313
I love the a cappella thing
you did at the beginning.

12:59.313 --> 13:01.315
Oh, yeah, that was so cool.
And it was so inviting.

13:01.315 --> 13:05.419
Wendy, I love those little
moments in your mixed voice.

13:05.419 --> 13:07.221
Yes.
The little subtleties.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.289
When you're able
to pull that off

13:09.289 --> 13:12.192
and give us
those amazing big notes,

13:12.192 --> 13:14.094
it's just a tour de force.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.697
Thank you.

13:16.697 --> 13:18.498
Jonathan,
I loved the song.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.400
It breathed such a great energy
into the room,

13:20.400 --> 13:23.504
and how you delivered it
was so well done.

13:23.504 --> 13:26.273
Thank you so much.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.709
Ma'am.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.310
You're one
of those vocalists

13:30.310 --> 13:32.479
that literally is the reason
why I'm sitting here.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.615
How you navigate, like ‐‐
Oh, said navigate.

13:34.615 --> 13:37.451
Did it, yep.
But how you...

13:37.451 --> 13:40.120
You go where you feel
like you should go

13:40.120 --> 13:42.189
and it just happens
to be the perfect spot.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.092
I think you have to
give it to Wendy.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.628
Thank you, Coaches.

13:47.628 --> 13:49.730
Wendy, can you please hold some
meet‐and‐greet passes

13:49.730 --> 13:51.231
for Kelly and I
for your tour?

13:51.231 --> 13:53.433
Just let us know.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.371
Jonathan, when I paired you
with Wendy, part of it was,

13:57.371 --> 13:59.173
"Let's see what this guy's
made of."

13:59.173 --> 14:00.274
Man,
you stepped out here,

14:00.274 --> 14:03.410
I mean,
that was incredible, man.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.279
Thank you. Thank you.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.381
Can't even imagine
the offers

14:07.381 --> 14:09.616
that are gonna come your way,
Wendy.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.719
I'm just so happy
for you. It's about damn time.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.423
You guys are all like kings
and queens and empresses

14:16.423 --> 14:20.460
and emperors of your worlds,
so I just want you to know

14:20.460 --> 14:24.331
that I really appreciate
this moment in time.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.500
Well, that's nice of you to say
that we're the emperors

14:26.500 --> 14:29.203
and the ‐‐ yeah, but you're
the one that has a voice

14:29.203 --> 14:31.705
that's so important
that you had to wear armor

14:31.705 --> 14:33.340
around it.

14:33.340 --> 14:36.076
Must protect
the instrument.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.211
Blake, the time has come.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.580
Who is the winner
of this knockout?

14:43.317 --> 14:46.320
Oh.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.721
Man, you made this tough
for me,

14:47.721 --> 14:49.556
but the winner of the knockout
is Wendy.

14:49.556 --> 14:53.460
Wendy Moten moving on.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.362
This is the tough part
of the knockouts.

14:55.362 --> 14:59.366
Giving me a hug.
Jonathan ‐‐ he blew me away.

14:59.366 --> 15:02.436
The only problem with that
is Wendy blew the building away,

15:02.436 --> 15:05.806
and I fully expect
to see her in the finale.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.076
Got the contemporaries
of today

15:09.076 --> 15:12.613
saying that you've still got it.
It keeps me going.

15:12.613 --> 15:14.615
Coaches, let me remind you
Jonathan is available to steal.

15:14.615 --> 15:16.817
Jonathan, anything you want
to say to your coach?

15:16.817 --> 15:18.352
Blake, you giving me
the second chance

15:18.352 --> 15:21.421
to even be here
right now, so thank you.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.690
Give it up one more time
for Jonathan Mouton,

15:23.690 --> 15:24.725
ladies and gentlemen.

15:24.725 --> 15:26.727
Jonathan,
he did a great job.

15:26.727 --> 15:29.730
But I have a lot of, like,
soulful male singers on my team,

15:29.730 --> 15:31.331
and I only have one steal,

15:31.331 --> 15:34.067
so I'm just waiting
for something unexpected.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.636
I love everyone so much.

15:35.636 --> 15:37.237
I'm telling you, man,
something's going on with me.

I'm getting ‐‐
You're getting mushy?

15:39.239 --> 15:40.240
Yeah.

This is married Blake.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.143
It's Gwen.
Yep.

How's everyone feeling?
I'm feeling like this.

I love my team.
I'm like

16:47.690 --> 16:49.826
So we don't get to save anybody
this round.

16:49.826 --> 16:51.828
I'm super worried
about the no saves, though.

I know.
Only steals from now on.

They're little Christmas
ornaments.

"Voice" coaches
have to have pockets.

Come on. Let's go.
Okay. Alright.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.376
Let's go do some knockouts.
Alright, let's do this.

17:06.376 --> 17:07.644
I'm so excited you're here.
Hi!

17:07.644 --> 17:10.246
Nice to see you.
And you're married now?

17:10.246 --> 17:12.515
I am.
You as well? Yeah, we had a kid.

17:12.515 --> 17:17.587
That is so exciting.
I met Ed when I had red hair.

17:17.587 --> 17:21.057
It was in 2012.
He was at my manager's office,

17:21.057 --> 17:23.293
just hanging
and playing music.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.528
He is a brilliant songwriter.

17:25.528 --> 17:27.363
How is it
sending people home?

17:27.363 --> 17:29.399
The worst.
I'm, like, not okay.

17:29.399 --> 17:30.800
Yeah, I can imagine.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.502
I've known Ariana
for like a long, long time,

17:32.502 --> 17:35.238
and we've worked together
on songs in the past.

17:35.238 --> 17:36.739
We've jammed.

17:36.739 --> 17:38.708
It's gonna be a good
first season for her, I think.

17:38.708 --> 17:40.410
Who do you think
it's gonna be?

17:40.410 --> 17:42.111
I don't know,
but I'm pumped.

17:42.111 --> 17:45.815
So my first pairing, these are
two of my favorite women.

17:45.815 --> 17:50.587
Raquel has this really
sweet tone and runs

17:50.587 --> 17:53.756
and the best energy.
She's such a star.

17:53.756 --> 17:58.061
And Katie Rae has one of
the most powerful voices

17:58.061 --> 18:00.463
I've ever heard.
I'm excited to hear them.

18:00.463 --> 18:02.232
Here they come.
Oh, my God!

18:02.232 --> 18:04.601

that this is happening to me.

18:08.771 --> 18:11.608
I've looked up to him for years.
Can somebody pinch me?

18:11.608 --> 18:15.511
Am I dreaming?
How are you guys doing?

18:15.511 --> 18:17.780
Hi, Ed.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, my God. Hi!

18:17.780 --> 18:20.083
Ed Sheeran.
He's been everywhere

18:20.083 --> 18:22.118
and he's worked with
so many people.

18:22.118 --> 18:23.086
He's a songwriter.

18:23.086 --> 18:25.688
He has amazing artists
featured on his songs.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.724
He's such an amazing talent.

18:27.724 --> 18:29.425
Jumper's really cool.
Oh, my God.

18:29.425 --> 18:32.161
And that's something that's
gonna help push us forward.

18:32.161 --> 18:34.898
Hopefully lives.
When I leave set,

18:34.898 --> 18:37.100
I don't stop talking
about you all.

18:37.100 --> 18:40.103
She's like a proud mum.
So who's singing first?

18:40.103 --> 18:41.671
I will be the one
singing first.

18:41.671 --> 18:43.072
Okay.

Sweet.
Yeah, it really spoke to me.

18:47.110 --> 18:49.245
I've been away from my husband
and my son.

even if I'm not there."
Oh, man.

how on earth people do it.

will pay off dividends.

Your voice has such power

Also,
you're doing tiny riffs.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.442
They're so good.
I want to hear more.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.810
Go for it, just feel it,

19:53.810 --> 19:55.578
and just ‐‐
and just roll with it.
Alrighty.

19:55.578 --> 19:57.747
I love that note.
You'll do that so beautifully.

19:57.747 --> 19:59.849
Also, when you are belting,

19:59.849 --> 20:02.118
do you feel like healthy
right now vocally?

20:02.118 --> 20:04.454
Do you feel tired at all
from the amount of singing

20:04.454 --> 20:05.622
and rehearsing
that you've been doing?

20:05.622 --> 20:07.223
I've had some rough
couple of days

20:07.223 --> 20:08.725
just missing my family,

20:08.725 --> 20:10.426
so there's been
some tears being shed.
I'm so sorry.

20:10.426 --> 20:11.594
It's a great song choice
for that.

20:11.594 --> 20:13.463
I think use that emotion in it,
then.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.764
Yeah.
Go soft, go loud.

20:14.764 --> 20:17.600
What helps me sing
through fatigue,

20:17.600 --> 20:20.236
try to bring
your falsetto down

20:20.236 --> 20:22.539
when you're warming up
instead of your chest voice up.

20:22.539 --> 20:24.774
Okay.
That's gonna make you tired.

20:24.774 --> 20:26.776
You'll notice it
when you go to belt,

20:26.776 --> 20:29.445
you'll be like, "I don't feel
any sort of bumps or kinks."

20:29.445 --> 20:30.613
Appreciate that.

20:30.613 --> 20:33.516
Ariana has lived up
to the hype.

20:33.516 --> 20:36.519
She's just so real
and thoughtful.

20:36.519 --> 20:39.622
I am just super grateful
to be on her team.

20:39.622 --> 20:41.824
What you're feeling,
let that come out

20:41.824 --> 20:44.194

at the end. Don't be afraid.

♪ When I don't feel like
I'm worth defending ♪

20:47.597 --> 20:49.599

in her performance.

20:51.601 --> 20:54.103
I hope that this opportunity
pays off for her.

20:54.103 --> 20:55.138
Love you so much.

20:55.138 --> 20:57.774
My heart hurts for her
missing her family.

20:57.774 --> 21:00.476
I hope singing this
feels therapeutic.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.612
I think it'll really
feel emotional,

21:02.612 --> 21:04.814

for this from her.

it kind of reminds me of my mom,

21:11.487 --> 21:13.156
just the soulful vibe to it.
We would always just,

21:13.156 --> 21:15.058

21:26.803 --> 21:30.573
I'm living in Miami.
I came by myself.

21:30.573 --> 21:33.376
My mom is my queen.
She is my number‐one supporter.

21:33.376 --> 21:36.713
And it's very sad that we don't
live in the same city anymore,

21:51.728 --> 21:53.596
They feel very free

21:53.596 --> 21:55.565

gorgeous rendition.
Thank you.

22:01.771 --> 22:05.108

is that she knows who she is.

22:05.108 --> 22:07.510
You have such
a poignant point of view.

22:07.510 --> 22:11.114
Having that extra sense of self
is so special.

22:11.114 --> 22:14.150
I think this is
her lane ‐‐ soulful, upbeat.

22:14.150 --> 22:16.052

her voice

22:16.052 --> 22:17.587
and her energy perfectly.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.756
I'm really glad you guys get

Can I use my steal

in having to steal

29:21.177 --> 29:22.512
This is extra hard
for me

29:22.512 --> 29:25.181
because both of you have been
two of my favorites.

29:25.181 --> 29:28.351
Katie Rae, your tone,
your strength.

29:28.351 --> 29:30.453
I just feel like
you've left

29:30.453 --> 29:34.157
a huge piece of your soul
on the stage.
Thank you.

29:34.157 --> 29:37.727
And, Raquel, I love your runs.
They're purposeful.

29:37.727 --> 29:39.462
They come out of nowhere.
She's like,

29:39.462 --> 29:41.197
"I'm gonna pull one out of here,
and I'm gonna do it perfectly,

29:41.197 --> 29:42.599
and then I'm gonna
trickle down and do something

29:42.599 --> 29:47.070
that sounds like gymnastics,"
and it's beautiful.

29:47.070 --> 29:49.205
Tough decision for you,
Ariana.

29:49.205 --> 29:50.707

Tough decision for you, Ariana.

30:15.665 --> 30:18.067
Who is the winner
of this knockout?

30:21.504 --> 30:27.644
The winner

30:27.644 --> 30:29.212
Raquel Trinidad!

30:29.212 --> 30:30.780
This is really it.
This is where we're getting

30:30.780 --> 30:34.217
our final team together
to go to the lives,

30:34.217 --> 30:36.553
so it's quite a bit
of pressure.

30:36.553 --> 30:38.821
Thank you.
I went with Raquel.

30:38.821 --> 30:40.056

of her voice

30:44.460 --> 30:47.463
we can tap into.
Thank you, guys. Congratulations!

30:47.463 --> 30:50.200
To make it to the live shows
is, like, all that I wanted,

30:50.200 --> 30:53.536

and cry.

is available to steal.

Katie, anything you'd like
to say to your coach?

31:02.078 --> 31:05.181
I was a fan before, but now that
I've gotten to know you,

31:05.181 --> 31:08.718
she's just honestly
one of the most amazing people.

31:08.718 --> 31:10.687
She cares about all of us
as a team.

31:10.687 --> 31:12.422

you know?

31:12.422 --> 31:14.524
I'm just so grateful
for all of you.
You're so brilliant.

31:14.524 --> 31:15.625
So I appreciate it.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.594
Give it up again
for Katie Rae.

31:19.462 --> 31:23.333
We got a steal! Kelly Clarkson!

31:23.333 --> 31:25.134
I used my only steal
on Katie Rae

31:25.134 --> 31:27.070
because I feel like I don't have
anybody like her on my team.

31:27.070 --> 31:28.605
I've wanted Katie Rae
since the blinds, y'all,

31:28.605 --> 31:30.206
so I finally got her.

31:30.206 --> 31:32.442
What a smart decision

Yes! What's up, Ed Sheeran?

is incredible.

31:56.199 --> 31:57.767
I was a fan
of Kelly Clarkson

31:57.767 --> 31:59.802
when she was singing
"Behind these Hazel Eyes"

31:59.802 --> 32:01.604
and "Because of You"
and "Since U Been Gone"

32:01.604 --> 32:03.172

I love Kelly just as a human.

32:08.211 --> 32:10.713

to pick, so...
Cool.

32:13.049 --> 32:16.753

Are we gonna dance?

32:16.753 --> 32:18.588

32:18.588 --> 32:20.590
Kinsey Rose
is a country singer,

32:20.590 --> 32:23.193
and Gymani sings, like,
R&B/pop.

32:23.193 --> 32:25.328
These two could not
be more night and day.

32:25.328 --> 32:28.097

that we speak
the Queen's English,

Whoo!

42:23.193 --> 42:25.728
Wow, you guys
couldn't be more different.

42:25.728 --> 42:27.297
Kinsey, I don't know

42:27.297 --> 42:30.300
that I've ever heard anybody
not do the falsetto part

42:30.300 --> 42:32.068
in the chorus,
you did it full voice,

42:32.068 --> 42:33.336
and it was like, "Whoa."

42:33.336 --> 42:35.705
And then, Gymani,
you are so special.

42:35.705 --> 42:37.373
You're
an incredible singer.
Thank you, thank you.

42:37.407 --> 42:40.043
You're an
incredible performer.
Thank you.

42:40.043 --> 42:41.544
I think I'd be going
with Gymani.

42:41.544 --> 42:43.413
Thank you.

42:43.413 --> 42:46.616
You both have
such concise

42:46.616 --> 42:48.351
and clear senses of self.

42:48.351 --> 42:50.553
I feel like,
if I'm in the car listening

42:50.553 --> 42:52.789
and your song started
on the radio, I'd be like,

42:52.789 --> 42:54.390
"Oh, that's Kinsey.
Love her."

42:54.390 --> 42:56.192
And then, of yours, I'd be like,
"Oh, my god, Gymani.

42:56.192 --> 42:58.428
I love this record."
So it's really

42:58.428 --> 43:00.296
a difficult position to be in

43:00.296 --> 43:02.699
'cause you're both
just that good.

43:02.699 --> 43:06.302
Kinsey, I've told you your tone,
your breath control.

43:06.302 --> 43:08.438
You just sound like
you should be making records.

43:08.438 --> 43:11.741
And, Gymani, you just light
this stage up.

43:11.741 --> 43:14.377
Thank you.
Like fire,
have a point of view,

43:14.377 --> 43:16.846
and live in that point of view
and say,

43:16.846 --> 43:21.351
"I'm a star and I deserve to put
my own spin on these songs."

43:21.351 --> 43:22.852
And she did it
in houndstooth.

43:22.852 --> 43:26.589
Yes, in houndstooth.
Thank you, Coaches.

43:26.589 --> 43:28.191
Alright, Kelly, give us
some thoughts on the knockout

43:28.191 --> 43:29.325
and then tell us who won.

43:29.325 --> 43:30.527
Gymani, I was
a little nervous

43:30.527 --> 43:32.328
when I saw the song,
but I was like,

43:32.328 --> 43:34.430
"Where are we gonna go
to make it not linear?"

43:34.430 --> 43:37.567
Well,
that's how you do it.

43:37.567 --> 43:39.736
Kinsey, you took it somewhere
really beautiful.

43:39.736 --> 43:41.337
You sustained
that big, huge note.

43:41.337 --> 43:42.805
You did such a great job.

43:42.805 --> 43:44.340
Actually, I was watching you
both walk out

43:44.340 --> 43:46.342
and I was like,
"This is literally like me

43:46.342 --> 43:48.344
split in two."

43:48.344 --> 43:50.413
I relate, you know,
to both of you musically.

43:50.413 --> 43:53.216
That makes a lot of sense,
actually. And it's really hard.

43:53.216 --> 43:54.851
Kelly, who is the winner
of this knockout?

43:57.153 --> 43:59.255
My decision isn't
because I think this person

43:59.255 --> 44:01.191
is the better singer.

44:01.191 --> 44:05.395
I think this might be
the better competitor.

44:05.395 --> 44:07.597
The winner of this knockout
is Gymani.

44:07.597 --> 44:09.566
Gymani, congratulations.

44:09.566 --> 44:12.068
What Gymani did
with "PILLOWTALK"

44:12.068 --> 44:14.604
made me recognize
she really came to win.

44:14.604 --> 44:17.807

44:34.290 --> 44:36.192
I didn't use my steal
for Kinsey

44:36.192 --> 44:39.295
because I'm really trying
to narrow down

44:39.295 --> 44:42.332
to one great country artist
on my team this season.

44:42.332 --> 44:43.833

Yeah.

I don't have any idea
where I'm gonna use it yet,

45:13.940 --> 45:16.075
but I'm really looking
for a vocalist

put on a great show.

into music professionally,

people I met in America.

It's so big, it's so round,
and how you would navigate...

Ooh! Navigate.
...from your chest voice

55:33.100 --> 55:34.835
to your full voice
and then into your falsetto

55:34.835 --> 55:37.537
was just so effortless.
Thank you so much, Kelly.

56:07.067 --> 56:08.435

On the other hand,
Joshua came out here

knowing this is the last chance

56:13.440 --> 56:14.274

gorgeously.

why this, you know?

It's John's fault.
No, I'm kidding.

I would say Sabrina
for this, yeah.

1:02:19.873 --> 1:02:22.442
that can connect, as well.

1:02:26.046 --> 1:02:28.982
You could really see,
obviously, the emotion

1:02:28.982 --> 1:02:30.918
when she was singing
rather than just like,

1:02:30.918 --> 1:02:32.486
"Sorry, this is too much
for me" and going,

1:02:32.486 --> 1:02:34.054
she, like, fought through it.

1:02:34.054 --> 1:02:37.190

precision singing.

and I didn't get it.

1:02:43.163 --> 1:02:45.165
I remember being crushed,
and then it just happened.

1:02:45.165 --> 1:02:48.101

on this show, do not stop.

This is ‐‐
This is impossible to do.

1:02:56.143 --> 1:02:58.812
I think this is gonna
come down to whoever can really

1:02:58.812 --> 1:03:01.181
just spill their guts
but still hold it together

1:03:01.181 --> 1:03:04.918
enough to give a solid vocal
performance at the same time.

1:03:04.918 --> 1:03:06.453
And that's why
you've won eight times.

1:03:06.453 --> 1:03:09.323
Pretty much.
Right.

1:03:14.461 --> 1:03:22.069

Help me!
Oh, my Lord.

1:08:00.213 --> 1:08:01.815
Those were so incredible.

1:08:01.815 --> 1:08:04.451
Hailey, that was brave of you
to sing the one and only

1:08:04.451 --> 1:08:07.354
Blake Shelton's song
right in front of him.

1:08:07.354 --> 1:08:09.289
The voice that you have,

1:08:09.289 --> 1:08:12.292
it's just so strong
and so powerful.

1:08:12.292 --> 1:08:15.395
Libianca, I love how you
switch up the melody.

1:08:15.395 --> 1:08:19.099
I love that you saved
that very high note for the end.

1:08:19.099 --> 1:08:23.437
I would have to give
this one to... Libianca.

1:08:23.437 --> 1:08:27.774
Hailey, your voice
is just powerful

1:08:27.774 --> 1:08:30.911
and just filled up
this room with energy,

1:08:30.911 --> 1:08:33.413
and I was like, "How is
Libianca gonna follow that?"

1:08:33.413 --> 1:08:37.217
And then it was
a master class in vocals.

1:08:37.217 --> 1:08:38.518
I love your outfit, too.

1:08:38.518 --> 1:08:40.420
Which is another part
of my coaching.

1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:42.356
Yes, and Blake, I know
had so much to do with it.

1:08:42.356 --> 1:08:44.858
Obviously the denim king
helped you.

1:08:44.858 --> 1:08:47.060
You had me on the edge
of my seat,

1:08:47.060 --> 1:08:49.429
and for that reason,
I would pick Libianca.

1:08:49.429 --> 1:08:53.200
Hailey, you are like
a baby Janis Joplin.

1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:54.501
I haven't really heard

1:08:54.501 --> 1:08:57.304
a female in that lane
since Gretchen Wilson.

1:08:57.304 --> 1:09:01.208
And then Libianca had so much
cool texture and vibe.

1:09:01.208 --> 1:09:02.910
I think the only reason
why I'm leaning

1:09:02.910 --> 1:09:05.345
a little bit more towards Hailey
is I don't think anyone

1:09:05.345 --> 1:09:07.514
on the show
is doing that.

1:09:07.514 --> 1:09:10.250
Thank you, Coaches.
Alright, buddy.

1:09:10.250 --> 1:09:11.785
Give us some thoughts
on the knockout.

1:09:11.785 --> 1:09:15.088
Hailey, I've literally
lost years off my life

1:09:15.088 --> 1:09:16.790
trying to get through
that vocal,

1:09:16.790 --> 1:09:19.993
and listening
to you sing that, holy crap.

1:09:19.993 --> 1:09:21.428
Thank you.
And at first,

1:09:21.428 --> 1:09:23.230
I thought when you came out
here that since rehearsal

1:09:23.230 --> 1:09:25.299
you'd been to
Adam Levine's tattoo artist,

1:09:25.299 --> 1:09:27.434
and I was like,
"Oh, my God, what has she done?"

1:09:27.434 --> 1:09:29.937
Please God.

1:09:29.937 --> 1:09:33.307
And then Libianca,
she was having a hard time

1:09:33.307 --> 1:09:35.309
even getting through the song
in rehearsals,

1:09:35.309 --> 1:09:37.778
and to see you
pull it together and do it,

1:09:37.778 --> 1:09:38.512
that's incredible.

1:09:38.512 --> 1:09:40.213
Blake, the time has come.

1:09:40.213 --> 1:09:42.282
Who is the winner
of this knockout?
Oh, my gosh.

1:09:42.282 --> 1:09:47.187
This one
is soul‐crushing.

1:09:47.187 --> 1:09:52.059
Uh, the winner
of this knockout... is Libianca.

1:09:52.059 --> 1:09:54.895
Libianca, congratulations!

1:09:54.895 --> 1:09:56.296
My heart's broken right now.

1:09:56.296 --> 1:09:58.098
It wouldn't have mattered
who I chose,

1:09:58.098 --> 1:10:02.069
but there was no way in hell
I was gonna let Libianca leave.

1:10:02.069 --> 1:10:05.072
I feel like she had
the tallest mountain to climb,

1:10:05.072 --> 1:10:07.040
and she was able
to get it together.

1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:10.544
As a coach, there's no way
I can't reward that.

1:10:10.544 --> 1:10:12.913
I'm so excited to go
to the live playoffs.

1:10:12.913 --> 1:10:15.249
I'm lit. I'm ready.
Oh, I'm so ‐‐ Ooh!

1:10:15.249 --> 1:10:16.984
Hailey, anything you want
to say to Blake?

1:10:16.984 --> 1:10:20.287
I was here Season 19,
and you told me to come back,

1:10:20.287 --> 1:10:22.956
and I just want to thank you
for giving me that chance.

1:10:22.956 --> 1:10:24.858
Put your hands
together for Hailey Green,

1:10:24.858 --> 1:10:29.329
ladies and gentlemen! 15?

1:10:29.329 --> 1:10:30.998

really cool, very soulful.

a bit more.

1:12:50.170 --> 1:12:51.972
Okay.
You can really
show off your voice there.

1:12:52.005 --> 1:12:53.874
You should be really confident
about this.
Okay, yeah.

1:12:53.874 --> 1:12:55.242
It's good.
I'm nervous, but...you know.

1:12:55.242 --> 1:12:57.778
Don't be.
You're an amazing singer.

1:12:57.778 --> 1:12:59.346
Shake away some nerves
by just nailing it

1:12:59.346 --> 1:13:00.981
a couple of times
beforehand.
Yeah. Okay.

1:13:00.981 --> 1:13:02.316
I do get nervous
before performances,

1:13:02.316 --> 1:13:04.284
and I think nerves
are healthy, though.

1:13:04.284 --> 1:13:06.453
I don't think she should have
any confidence issues

1:13:06.453 --> 1:13:07.921
going into this.

1:13:07.921 --> 1:13:09.790
'Cause you have that
really pretty like

1:13:09.790 --> 1:13:12.793
raspy head voice thing.

1:13:16.496 --> 1:13:18.498
♪ I love you

1:13:18.498 --> 1:13:19.967
Okay.
That was it.

1:13:19.967 --> 1:13:21.935
Come on up,
Girl Named Tom.

1:13:21.935 --> 1:13:24.037
Alright, y'all.
What have you picked?

1:13:24.037 --> 1:13:27.040
We've chosen "Wichita Lineman"
by Glen Campbell.

1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:29.309
It's a song about
a really hardworking man.

1:13:29.309 --> 1:13:31.178
And we relate to
this song because this is

1:13:31.178 --> 1:13:34.181
a pretty stubborn man,
but he's got this hope.

1:13:34.181 --> 1:13:37.084
Our family has gotten
a lot closer

1:13:37.084 --> 1:13:40.954
because our dad was diagnosed
with terminal cancer. I'm sorry.

1:13:40.954 --> 1:13:42.456
He has such
a positive attitude

1:13:42.456 --> 1:13:44.057
going into every
doctor's appointment.

1:13:44.057 --> 1:13:46.059
It's been huge for us
to see that.

1:13:46.059 --> 1:13:48.295
Yeah.
Yeah.

1:13:48.295 --> 1:13:51.365
♪ And the Wichita lineman

1:13:51.398 --> 1:13:54.534
♪ Ooh

1:13:54.568 --> 1:13:57.170
♪ Is still on the line

1:13:57.170 --> 1:13:59.239
We're definitely following
in Dad's footsteps.

1:13:59.239 --> 1:14:01.541
He wrote songs for each one of
us when we were little.

1:14:01.541 --> 1:14:03.176
The fact
that we can be here

1:14:03.176 --> 1:14:05.045
and call him,
sharing this wonderful news

1:14:05.045 --> 1:14:08.315
with him every day, I think it
gives us all a lot of life.

1:14:08.315 --> 1:14:12.085
But, um,
it's not easy, right?

1:14:12.085 --> 1:14:14.321
Yeah, it's not been easy
to be away

1:14:14.321 --> 1:14:18.325
from them for so long.
Yeah.

1:14:18.325 --> 1:14:21.028
The biggest thing that
I'm grateful to Dad for

1:14:21.028 --> 1:14:23.230
is his presence
in our lives

1:14:23.230 --> 1:14:26.300
and that he's chosen
to believe in us

1:14:26.300 --> 1:14:31.405
and help us and guide us,
and he's been there every day.

1:14:34.508 --> 1:14:36.243
Talked about your dad.

1:14:36.243 --> 1:14:38.145
It was my grandmother
was the thing

1:14:38.145 --> 1:14:39.446
that really got me
and my brother together.

1:14:39.446 --> 1:14:41.782
She was passing away,
and she said,

1:14:41.782 --> 1:14:43.216
"I want to see you work
together before I die."

1:14:43.216 --> 1:14:44.885
And so that's why
we did "Perfect."
Wow.

1:14:44.885 --> 1:14:46.453
My brother
does classical music.

1:14:46.453 --> 1:14:48.188
All of that string arrangement
is my brother.

1:14:48.188 --> 1:14:49.389
Wow.
And that was like

1:14:49.389 --> 1:14:51.091
the first time
we worked together.

1:14:51.091 --> 1:14:52.326
Wow. That's great.
And yeah, it's great.

1:14:52.326 --> 1:14:55.128
And it just
sounds so heavenly.

1:14:55.128 --> 1:14:58.231
My only comment would be
the dynamics on the harmonies,

1:14:58.231 --> 1:15:02.135
just ease
into some of them. Yeah.

1:15:02.135 --> 1:15:04.338
Is that one part normal,
that little like...

1:15:05.973 --> 1:15:07.274
up the octave,
that's real pretty.

1:15:07.274 --> 1:15:08.508
She made that up.

1:15:08.508 --> 1:15:10.010
And it's nice
that you're changing it

1:15:10.010 --> 1:15:11.478
and making it your own.
Yeah.

1:15:11.478 --> 1:15:13.780
I think it's important because
that's what makes you stand out.

1:15:13.780 --> 1:15:14.948
Thank you.
It sounds so beautiful.

Come on.

1:15:23.323 --> 1:15:24.958
I'm just gonna go
with my gut,

1:15:24.958 --> 1:15:27.194
which I really hope
is the right decision.

1:15:27.194 --> 1:15:29.296
My job is the best.
I actually come in and go,

1:15:29.296 --> 1:15:33.233
"Yep, cool, right, yeah.
See you later." Feels good, huh?

Girl Named Tom,
it's always so consistent,

1:20:58.533 --> 1:21:01.403
and I feel like that would be
the performance of a night

1:21:01.403 --> 1:21:04.939
at an awards show.
And then, Holly,

1:21:04.939 --> 1:21:07.776
your voice is the kind
that I grew up hearing

1:21:07.776 --> 1:21:09.778
and being like,
"I want to sing."

1:21:09.778 --> 1:21:13.348
I would have to give
this one to Holly. Thank you.

1:21:13.348 --> 1:21:16.818
Girl Named Tom,
when I hear blend like that,

1:21:16.818 --> 1:21:19.421
the way that you all
put it together,

1:21:19.421 --> 1:21:21.289

Holly, that was just
perfect singing.

1:21:23.558 --> 1:21:27.729
When you do it right, it just
tugs at people's heartstrings.

1:21:27.729 --> 1:21:29.264
Thank you.

1:21:29.264 --> 1:21:32.534
Kelly, I'm not gonna help you
pick this time. Oh, my God!

1:21:32.534 --> 1:21:36.338
Thank you, Coaches.
Kelly, it comes down to you.

1:21:36.338 --> 1:21:38.239
Give us some thoughts
on the knockout.

1:21:38.239 --> 1:21:39.841

like, a lot of talented
people this season.

Girl Named Tom,
you make everything so special.

1:21:45.847 --> 1:21:48.683
It sounds like one voice,
like when you're real tired,

1:21:48.683 --> 1:21:50.819
and you hit like three notes
at the same time.

1:21:50.819 --> 1:21:52.253
Who can do that?
You can do that?

1:21:52.253 --> 1:21:53.555
Yeah.
That can happen.

1:21:53.555 --> 1:21:55.757
Wait, that doesn't
happen to you? Tri‐tone.

1:21:55.757 --> 1:21:57.192
You can hit
three notes at once?

1:21:57.192 --> 1:21:58.727
Yeah, I have a video.
I'll show you.

1:21:58.727 --> 1:21:59.928
What sorcery is this?

1:21:59.928 --> 1:22:02.731
I am magical, John Legend.
Oh, my gosh.

1:22:02.731 --> 1:22:06.868
And, Holly, like, you have
such a beautiful voice.

1:22:06.868 --> 1:22:08.637
It's like all the things
I physically want

1:22:08.637 --> 1:22:09.804
to look like,
like a woman.

1:22:09.804 --> 1:22:11.539
Like, it's beautiful.
It's edgy.

1:22:11.539 --> 1:22:13.408
It's just an emotion.
Yeah.

1:22:13.408 --> 1:22:14.809
Y'all were all
four‐chair turns,

1:22:14.809 --> 1:22:16.945
and you chose to pick me
for whatever reason.

1:22:16.945 --> 1:22:19.381
Well, you were a blocked
from John, one of you.

1:22:19.381 --> 1:22:20.649
Ooh, awkward.

1:22:20.649 --> 1:22:22.684
Ariana did that to me.
I stand by it.

1:22:22.684 --> 1:22:24.219
You stand by it.

1:22:24.219 --> 1:22:25.787
I would never.
I would never.

1:22:25.787 --> 1:22:26.788
You are such a liar.

1:22:28.323 --> 1:22:30.725

of this knockout?

1:22:30.725 --> 1:22:32.894

You're incredible.

There you have it.
Congratulations.

1:22:42.404 --> 1:22:44.939
Man, Holly ‐‐ she's got
such a rad voice,

1:22:44.939 --> 1:22:46.675
but I had to pick Girl Named Tom

1:22:46.675 --> 1:22:48.276
because they sound
amazing together,

1:22:48.276 --> 1:22:50.845
but then they showed
how each of them sound alone,

1:22:50.845 --> 1:22:54.516
and they can hold their own.
That was so hard!

1:22:56.618 --> 1:22:59.921
Coaches, let me remind you
Holly is available to steal.

1:22:59.921 --> 1:23:03.258

- And there it is!
- Whoa!

1:23:34.489 --> 1:23:38.226
denied us the opportunity
to work together before.

I don't know.

picked Kelly anyway.

1:23:41.162 --> 1:23:43.932
Holly, you have all the tools
that one needs to be

1:23:43.932 --> 1:23:46.635
a great singer, but also
all the emotion.

1:23:46.635 --> 1:23:49.537
So I would love, I would

1:23:49.537 --> 1:23:50.772
♪ Love

1:23:50.805 --> 1:23:52.374
♪ You would love

1:23:52.374 --> 1:23:54.275
They're both involved
in musical theater.

1:23:54.275 --> 1:23:55.777
♪ I would love
♪ Love

1:23:55.777 --> 1:23:59.147
Ooh, okay.
I would love to coach you.

1:23:59.147 --> 1:24:02.384
Alright, Holly,
who do you pick as your coach?

1:24:02.384 --> 1:24:04.286
Come on, Holly!

1:24:04.286 --> 1:24:08.556
I love both of you.
Come on! Um...

1:24:08.556 --> 1:24:10.925
I'm gonna go with Ari. Oh.

1:24:10.925 --> 1:24:13.762
Ariana steals Holly Forbes!

1:24:13.762 --> 1:24:18.266
Well done.
So I used my steal on Holly.

1:24:18.266 --> 1:24:19.934
I have loved her
from the start.

1:24:19.934 --> 1:24:22.937
She adds ♪ so much value
to Team Ariana.

1:24:22.937 --> 1:24:26.408
I fought John tooth and nail,
and having her choose me

1:24:26.408 --> 1:24:29.544
was such a beautiful
full‐circle moment.

1:24:29.544 --> 1:24:30.945
I already like, honestly,

1:24:30.945 --> 1:24:33.315
was hoping if I lost
that she would still me

1:24:33.315 --> 1:24:34.783
'cause I wanted
to work with her.

1:24:34.783 --> 1:24:36.418
You are so gifted.
I'm so excited.

1:24:36.418 --> 1:24:38.720
Thank you!
You're never going anywhere.

1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:41.890
Burn. Burn.

1:24:41.890 --> 1:24:45.694
Feel the burn!
I'm angry! What's happening?

1:24:45.694 --> 1:24:47.329
Blake is in third grade.
