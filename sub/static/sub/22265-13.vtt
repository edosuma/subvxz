our imminent annihilation,

05:28.680 --> 05:30.181

12:10.200 --> 12:11.747
We nab Lucifer.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.224
If he is as weak as Cass says,

12:14.320 --> 12:16.538
then the angel cuffs should work on him.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.906
Yeah. Maybe.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.299
Well, maybe's all we got. So...

12:21.920 --> 12:22.909
We grab Satan,

12:23.680 --> 12:26.820
and we use his grace
to open up a door between two universes.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.559
Okay? Then we get Mom,
we get Jack, and we get out.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.501
Slam the door before Michael
follows us and destroys our universe.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.467
Now, it's gonna be harder
than it sounds.

12:35.560 --> 12:39.144
And so, the spell to open this rift
is in the angel tablet?

12:39.240 --> 12:44.018
Yeah, they are, on Earth 2, except--

12:44.200 --> 12:46.145
Except we don't have
the angel tablet anymore.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.920
No, we don't. We do have...

12:51.600 --> 12:52.624
The demon tablet.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.542
We thought it might
mention the spell as well

13:01.640 --> 13:03.187
because it, too, is the word of God.

SAM: Okay, so according to the report,

15:14.760 --> 15:17.137
the vic died from trauma.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.061
Something blunt driven through the body.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.060
There was also a slit in his neck,
which means--

15:24.200 --> 15:25.542
Lucifer fed on this angel's grace.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.860
Which means he's trying to
restore his power.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.627
- And if he does...
- We're boned.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.189
Epically.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.024
We're closed.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.549
Come back tomorrow.

Sister Jo.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.025
Or should I say "Aniel."

15:59.280 --> 16:00.269
You're an angel.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.349
Back at you,

16:04.760 --> 16:05.749
Lucifer.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.546
What? No, "Eek"?

16:10.600 --> 16:12.420
No "Spare me, Dark Master"?

16:13.760 --> 16:14.829
No quaking fear?

16:16.160 --> 16:17.229
- Should I quake?
- I mean, yeah,

16:17.320 --> 16:18.947
most people sort of do. Yeah.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.779
- I'm not most.
- Right.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.738
You're special
because you heal people for money.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.905
Not very heavenly, I have to say.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.827
We're not in Heaven. We're on Earth.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.180
You may have noticed, around here,

16:34.920 --> 16:35.989
good life ain't cheap.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.297
After the fall,

16:40.360 --> 16:43.261
all the angels were a mess,
desperate for housing.

16:43.840 --> 16:44.977
Any vessel would do.

16:45.800 --> 16:46.789
And they had no long game.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.705
- Yeah, that's...
- I, on the other hand,

16:49.960 --> 16:50.949
took some care.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.029
I listened.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.419
A woman was praying
for her dying husband.

16:55.720 --> 16:56.789
SO we made a trade.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.540
His life for her vessel.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.182
She was grateful.

17:03.680 --> 17:07.559
Ireafized _
humans are so desperate for life,

17:07.720 --> 17:10.985
they'd do almost anything,
pay almost anything.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.622
SO...

17:12.760 --> 17:13.897
Ka-ching!

17:14.400 --> 17:16.777
I was a 50-50 angel but, turns out,

17:17.160 --> 17:20.266
I am an excellent businesswoman.

17:20.920 --> 17:21.909
Wow.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.119
That is very impressive.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.459
As you can see, my high-octane grace
is a little bit low.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.879
SO I came for a recharge,

17:30.960 --> 17:32.825
which unfortunately,
doesn't end well for you.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.785
Not very cost-efﬁcient,
running around, killing angels.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.479
- What?
- Wouldn't it make more sense to keep

17:42.160 --> 17:43.627
one premium angel on tap?

17:44.880 --> 17:46.859
Take a sip now, sip later.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.740
Not taking all the grace,

17:50.240 --> 17:52.185
but giving the angel time to recharge.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.502
Then rinse and repeat.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.377
And that angel being...

18:01.040 --> 18:02.029
You'd do that?

18:02.960 --> 18:05.099
It's better than having you suck me dry
and kill me, isn't it?

18:05.960 --> 18:06.949
This way,

18:07.080 --> 18:09.184

18:25.280 --> 18:27.384

18:27.520 --> 18:29.147
I tell you what.
I'll be quick. I promise.

Just tell me _
have you ever seen this man?

18:34.680 --> 18:36.068
Actually, we had a lovely chat.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.540
He was curious about this faith healer
I'm savmg up to see.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.184
She's gonna fix this leg right up.

18:42.640 --> 18:43.629

18:44.960 --> 18:47.224
And did he, uh, believe in her?

18:47.320 --> 18:48.389
Not at first,

18:48.520 --> 18:51.159
but after I described her skills,
he was very supportive.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.829
Better?

19:19.320 --> 19:20.662

Wow.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.462
That was so much _more fun
than my last time.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.143
I had to kill that guy.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.949
When was that?

19:32.080 --> 19:33.069
Two nights ago.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.669
That was you?

19:35.680 --> 19:38.183
- That was all over angel radio.
- Yeah.

I saved your lives, and you shot me.

- No, I guess not.
- SAM: Dean asked you a question.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.103
What are you doing here?

20:40.200 --> 20:42.384
My sources tell me Lucifer's back.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.460
He's weak and he's, or was,

20:45.760 --> 20:48.320
in this wonderful little slice
of Americana.

20:48.920 --> 20:52.742
I was going to try and kill him,
as were you, I assume.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.229
Great.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.149
Who are you working for?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.340
Isn't it possible
that I'm simply trying to

20:59.440 --> 21:01.260
strike a blow for the good of humanity?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.622
Hmm.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.679
No. That's not possible.

would be an enormous feather in the cap.

word of mouth.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.022

isn't here, where is he?

Ah, excellent question.

21:25.760 --> 21:29.105

find out what he knows,
and put a bullet in him,

24:35.400 --> 24:37.823
I do. When I'm in that place,

24:38.840 --> 24:40.546
I can see how there'd be pain.

Do you know what my job was?

24:58.600 --> 24:59.589
Upstairs?

25:00.880 --> 25:01.869
I pushed a button.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.457
A soul would come in,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.139
I'd push a button, they'd be counted,

25:06.840 --> 25:08.057
and I'd wait for the next.

- Boring?

25:10.760 --> 25:12.421
- Eternal.
-Mmm.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.108
I mean, I had ideas.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.781
I saw how Heaven was running,

25:17.080 --> 25:18.297
and I knew how to fix it.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.147
But no one would listen to me.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.704
Not Michael, not Raphael, not Naomi.

to push my button.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.999
when we lost our wings,

25:40.440 --> 25:41.941
I wasn't devastated.

25:43.640 --> 25:44.857
I was liberated.

with the demon tablet,

- Yeah.

though, that there is definitely

opening a door to that other world.

- Well, that would be very useful.
- Yes.

very, very complicated.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.183
I'm just starting to, uh, decipher them.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.737
Well, let me know
if there's anything I can do to help.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.422
I doubt it, since apparently
I'm the only one on the planet

28:10.520 --> 28:11.623
who can read the damn thing.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.702

You mean before Michael comes?

28:15.560 --> 28:17.937
Before anything happens to Jack

28:18.640 --> 28:19.743

if they never make it
out of that terrible place.

- Or she's dead.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.103
(PHONE RINGING)

29:43.760 --> 29:44.749
This...

29:47.200 --> 29:48.189
Hello?

29:49.080 --> 29:50.342
My Card?

29:51.760 --> 29:52.749
Of course it’s good.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.106
Yeah, okay. Uh, you know what?

29:55.600 --> 29:56.919
Our system must be screvw.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.979
Do you mind bringing the card back
so I can run it again?

29:59.080 --> 30:00.069
Okay. Just a m/nute.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.139
Sure. I'll be here.
That's great. Thank you.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.942
Well, good news. She's alive.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.109
Aniel.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.109
ANIEL: Castiel.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.739
- What are you doing here?
- We were gonna ask you the same thing.

30:17.840 --> 30:18.977
We're looking for Lucifer.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.542
Have you seen him?
Do you know where he is?

30:22.320 --> 30:24.424
Yes. He's in the room.

30:24.520 --> 30:25.782
Has he hurt you?

30:26.400 --> 30:28.584
Not yet. He's threatened.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.701
He wants to drain my grace.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.222
- So he's still weak.
- Very.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.628
You have to help me.

30:35.520 --> 30:36.509
DEAN: We will.

30:37.320 --> 30:38.662
But first, you're gonna help us.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.904
Dad's always stealing
my best lines, man.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.859
-(SCOFFS)
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)

30:46.120 --> 30:47.257
ANIEL: Lord Lucifer?

30:48.040 --> 30:49.109
Could you let me in?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.945
Sorry. I forgot my key.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.742
"Lord Lucifer"?

30:54.920 --> 30:55.909
L
likey.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.389
Really, uh...

31:02.280 --> 31:03.941
- Mornin', sunshine.
- LUCIFER: What's up?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.581
Gents. Hey. (CHUCKLES)

31:11.480 --> 31:14.301
Oh. Cass. You're alive.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.429
That's...

31:16.600 --> 31:17.783
- That's awesome.
- ANIEL: They made me.

31:18.320 --> 31:21.460
They forced me to tell them
how weak you still are.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.180
Well, great seeing you.
It's been a long time.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.662
Uh, nice jacket there, Dean.
Your hair, Sam,

31:29.760 --> 31:32.502
is magnificent. Is that
a leave-in conditioner you have there?

31:37.480 --> 31:38.617
(WHISPERS) We got this. Go.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.069
SO what are you gonna do now?
You gonna... You gonna kill me?

31:43.800 --> 31:45.267
Mmm.

31:45.480 --> 31:46.469
Eventually.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.463
(GROANS)

31:55.600 --> 31:57.181
(GROANING)

32:00.920 --> 32:02.342
- We need to go.
- LUCIFER: Okay, just...

32:02.480 --> 32:04.220
I just wanna enjoy this
for just a minute.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.862
(DEAN AND SAM GROANING)

32:08.280 --> 32:09.497
(GASPING)

32:14.240 --> 32:16.344
That's good. That's really good.

32:16.440 --> 32:17.657
(GASPING)

32:23.000 --> 32:24.069
(GRU NTS)

32:25.880 --> 32:28.519
(couemue)

32:29.840 --> 32:33.537
Ugh. I've got to get in better shape.
This is ridiculous.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.418
- Wait, wait, wait. Did you just--
- No.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.101
They vanished before it went off.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.701
But you're welcome.

32:46.280 --> 32:49.465
- All right, so why did you, you know...
- Like I said,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.139
I help you, you help me.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.579
Right. Cool.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.979
Okay. So where on Earth do we go now?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.859
Congratulations, you just helped
Lucifer escape.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.229
Put another way,

33:11.680 --> 33:13.341
I opted out of my own escape

33:13.440 --> 33:16.420
and put myself in harm's way
to save your lives.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.379
- Again.
- All right, all right.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.664
- How did you get out of the trunk?
- I'm Ketch.

33:22.760 --> 33:23.863
I found the demon bomb

33:23.960 --> 33:25.621
in your weapons cache and I thought,

33:26.080 --> 33:29.140
with Lucifer's weakened state,
it might make a dent.

33:29.520 --> 33:34.059
Well, it seems his weakened state
may have been greatly exaggerated.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.500
I don't know.
In Heaven, she was nothing.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.386
She was a low-level functionary.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.903
Yeah, well, now she's Satan's gal pal.
That's awesome.

33:44.160 --> 33:46.503
Gentlemen, this may
once again fall on deaf ears,

33:46.600 --> 33:47.589
but I shall have another go.

33:48.280 --> 33:51.260
Clearly, Lucifer's more dangerous
than we thought.

33:51.360 --> 33:56.184
I propose we pool resources
and go after him together.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.947
Dude, why would we ever trust you?

34:00.720 --> 34:01.709
Fine.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.062
AS proof of my sincerity,
I shall come clean.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.583
I'm working for Asmodeus.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.379
- Happy?
- Whoa, what?

34:12.200 --> 34:13.781
How is that supposed to
make us feel better?

34:13.880 --> 34:16.098
It's not. It's supposed to
present an opportunity.

34:16.240 --> 34:20.222
If I'm working for him,
then I can pass information on to you.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.581
Oh, right. And you would do that for us?

34:25.680 --> 34:26.817
For everyone.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.584
I know you think I'm a monster--

34:31.680 --> 34:32.669
DEAN: Because you are.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.160
But even I must draw the line somewhere.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.160
And letting Lucifer free upon the Earth?

34:41.240 --> 34:43.424
Well, as it turns out, that's my line.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.819
Not to mention
the whole Michael situation.

34:50.800 --> 34:54.304
I know you want to kill me.
I know you can't forgive me.

34:54.400 --> 34:57.506
But if you think about it,
I'm the lesser of...

34:58.480 --> 35:00.619
Well, at least three evils.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.503
All I ask

35:08.080 --> 35:11.982
is that you wait to murder me
until after I prove useful.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.504
Hmm?

35:15.880 --> 35:18.519
I know we've had our problems
in the past,

35:18.640 --> 35:20.744
little family squabbles.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.740
Just minor, little disagreements.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.343
You know, kids being kids kinda stuff.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.462
But right now, you need me.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.061
Kill him.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.219
(STAMMERING)
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Okay.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.379
Number one, it's true.
I am powered down.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.943
- But you can't kill me.
- We could try.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.303
Repeatedly.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.584
Okay, look, number two,

35:41.800 --> 35:44.109
I happen to know
Heaven is in short supply of angels.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.779
All right, let's face it.
After Pop took a powder,

35:47.880 --> 35:51.304
your only strength, your only defense
was in numbers, yeah?

35:52.520 --> 35:55.307
And now, with the Prince of Hell
basically running...

35:56.280 --> 35:57.269
Hell,

35:57.400 --> 36:00.506
if the dark side makes a move,
y'all are screwed.

36:00.920 --> 36:04.060
You need more you.

36:06.320 --> 36:08.880
But with Dad gone and everything,

36:08.960 --> 36:11.269
I mean,
who's still up for birthin' angels?

36:15.480 --> 36:17.345
Yo. Yo.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.824
- You can't.
- Yeah.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.103
He can, Duma.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.946
Who are you to speak to me?

36:24.360 --> 36:26.783
Okay, she's with me,
and you're gonna listen to her.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.507
Hey, look, I was here when you,

36:28.600 --> 36:31.342
when all of you were born.
I saw how the old man did it.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.987
I can make angels.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.346
Okay? And I'll do it.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.625
-If_-
- Enough games, Lucifer.

36:38.840 --> 36:42.867
If for my incredible act of generosity,

36:43.840 --> 36:48.061
you name me the undisputed
and unquestioned ruler of Heaven.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.382
(LAUGHS)

36:52.520 --> 36:54.101
LUCIFER: Yeah? It's funny.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.019
Oh, come on. Let's face it.
You don't wanna run the place.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.497
Angels were
designed to follow, not lead.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.704
Don't give me the stink eye.
It wasn't my idea.

37:05.360 --> 37:08.147
The point is, you need me.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.027
And icing on the cake, guys,

37:12.640 --> 37:14.107
how'd you like your wings back?

37:33.200 --> 37:35.304
SO, Ketch, can we trust him?

37:36.440 --> 37:38.783
- Not even a little.
- Yeah, of course not, but...

37:40.400 --> 37:42.857
- We need him for now.
- Right.

37:43.760 --> 37:44.749
And when we don't?

37:47.080 --> 37:48.069
Guess.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.263
Donatello, you're doing great.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.385
I mean,
looks like you made a lot of progress.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.584
It's like pulling freaking teeth!

38:09.680 --> 38:11.625
I'm working my way
through the ingredients.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.429
Right.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.262
(CLEARS THROAT) Okay. But at least
we know the spell we need is in there.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.583
And we have a plan.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.422
Hail to the king, baby.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.940
MR. KETCl-l: I missed him by secono’s.

39:03.480 --> 39:06.187
Rest assured, Lucifer will be found.

39:06.680 --> 39:07.783
ASMODEUS: And killed.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.820
Before he causes any more problems.

39:11.600 --> 39:15.479
Or those idiot Winchesters use him
to open up a gate to Michael Land.

39:16.680 --> 39:20.184
Another stick-up-his-ass archangel
is the last thing I need.

39:20.400 --> 39:24.279
Yes, well, Lucifer is getting stronger,
and as good as I am,

39:25.680 --> 39:26.863
and I am very good,

39:27.680 --> 39:30.820
I don't think
even I can beat the Devil at full power.

39:31.720 --> 39:32.709
About that.

39:33.800 --> 39:37.065
You recall the important errand
I had mentioned?

39:39.560 --> 39:42.302
Word had got back to me
that a certain artifact

39:42.440 --> 39:46.422
I thought had been
lost forever resurfaced.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.181
And now it's mine.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.862
Beautiful, isn't it?

40:01.360 --> 40:02.349
Oh, yes.

40:03.040 --> 40:07.500
The only known weapon capable
of destroying an archangel.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.261
The archangel blade.

40:13.840 --> 40:18.345
You'll forgive me, but my reading
of the lore suggests that

40:19.080 --> 40:22.220
the blade is only effective
if wielded by an archangel.

40:22.600 --> 40:23.589
Oh, really?

40:25.880 --> 40:27.700
Thanks for the news flash.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.743
Allow me to make an introduction,
Mr. Ketch.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.499
Meet the Archangel Gabriel.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.349
English - SDH
