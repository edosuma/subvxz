01:42.219 --> 01:43.379
This is Lynda Carter...

01:43.454 --> 01:46.513
and here are some scenes
from Part 1 of The Feminum Mystique.

01:46.589 --> 01:48.147
It's amazing, isn't it?

01:48.224 --> 01:50.282
Yes, it's very impressive.

01:51.193 --> 01:53.661
Are you sure that thing can fly?

01:53.929 --> 01:55.520
We have copies of their plans.

01:55.596 --> 01:58.258
I've studied the controls so much
I know them by heart.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.425
And you can fly it?

02:18.882 --> 02:21.577
Red Control, this is Red Leader.
Code Z is in effect.

02:26.589 --> 02:27.987
Your plane explodes...

02:28.123 --> 02:32.354
and one of our submarines
is able to pluck you from the sea.

02:32.426 --> 02:35.361
At least we know now
their experimental jet plane is no good.

02:35.429 --> 02:37.192
What about the others on your mission?

02:37.264 --> 02:39.697
Taken prisoner. All except Captain Radl...

02:39.799 --> 02:42.562
who's obviously still somewhere
in the United States.

02:42.634 --> 02:45.330
You heard we lost the XPJ-1.

02:45.404 --> 02:46.769
Yes, Berlin told me.

02:46.839 --> 02:49.534
Well, the Americans have got
a secret weapon...

02:50.108 --> 02:53.770
that makes the XPJ-1
pale into insignificance.

03:03.618 --> 03:06.143
Your daughter grows stronger
and more agile every day.

03:06.221 --> 03:09.519
Yes, she grows more and more
like her older sister.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.624
But it's your older sister
that I wish to talk to you about.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.785
When I sent her away to America...

03:14.861 --> 03:18.957
I had no idea she would become
such a legend as Wonder Woman.

03:19.165 --> 03:22.895
Mother says to tell you
that you've spent enough time in America.

03:22.968 --> 03:25.299
You should come home
to Paradise Island...

03:25.369 --> 03:27.929
and start assuming your role
as heiress to the throne.

03:28.005 --> 03:31.804
This mysterious woman and her bracelets.

03:32.509 --> 03:35.739
This matter has priority
even over the XPJ-1.

03:36.412 --> 03:38.505
It's of incalculable importance.

03:45.986 --> 03:49.183
What would you imagine
we'd want of Wonder Woman?

03:49.256 --> 03:50.689
I don't know.

03:52.825 --> 03:55.851
But whatever it is,
you're not going to get it.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.994
What have you done
with General Blankenship?

03:58.062 --> 03:59.620
Just used him to flush you out.

04:01.065 --> 04:03.794
And now, the conclusion
of The Feminum Mystique.

04:06.936 --> 04:08.267
- Diana.
- Yes.

04:08.404 --> 04:10.167
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

04:10.239 --> 04:12.502
- Any news of Drusilla yet?
- None.

04:12.574 --> 04:15.407
I've tried everything.
The hospital, the police.

04:15.477 --> 04:17.808
She seems to have disappeared
without a trace.

04:17.878 --> 04:20.870
Is there any place
she could have gone off to?

04:22.782 --> 04:24.272
She might have gone home.

04:24.350 --> 04:26.079
Have you tried calling your family?

04:26.152 --> 04:28.517
It's a little bit difficult
to get through to them.

04:28.587 --> 04:31.055
- They don't have a telephone?
- Oh, no.

04:31.690 --> 04:33.987
Perhaps you ought to go home
and see for yourself.

04:34.058 --> 04:35.616
Take a few days off.

04:35.693 --> 04:38.183
Incidentally, where is home?

04:39.162 --> 04:41.494
It's a long way from here and right now...

04:41.565 --> 04:43.759
I'd rather stay in Washington.

04:43.833 --> 04:45.596
Whatever you like.

04:45.668 --> 04:48.465
But don't worry. It won't help Drusilla.

04:49.103 --> 04:50.502
I suppose so.

05:03.115 --> 05:05.947
That's funny, she reminds me
of someone I know.

05:06.318 --> 05:07.307
Who?

05:07.652 --> 05:09.176
A young girl I met the other day.

05:09.254 --> 05:12.154
It's not her, of course,
but there are similarities.

05:12.223 --> 05:13.952
We're wasting time. Come.

05:14.325 --> 05:16.986
I called you here to make sure
once and for all...

05:17.060 --> 05:18.891
that she is this Wonder Woman.

05:18.962 --> 05:21.828
We must be sure
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

05:22.164 --> 05:23.358
Hurry.

05:34.407 --> 05:37.000
I've brought you some company,
Wonder Woman.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.984
Satisfied, Captain?

06:02.263 --> 06:03.252
Yes...

06:04.131 --> 06:05.860
satisfied.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.633
The bracelets.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.072
Yes, sir, I'll tell him right away.

06:22.246 --> 06:25.146
Steve, General Blankenship just called.

06:25.215 --> 06:28.741
He wants to see you as soon as possible.
It's about the XPJ-1.

06:29.218 --> 06:33.154
The airfield reported that Peter Knight
didn't show up for work this morning.

06:33.222 --> 06:35.553
That's odd. Did you call his home?

06:35.623 --> 06:38.387
The General did, but there was no answer.

06:39.626 --> 06:41.423
I wonder where he is.

06:44.130 --> 06:46.155
- Any luck?
- Just a moment.

06:50.468 --> 06:53.562
I've checked crystalline, chemical,
and mechanical heterogeneity.

06:53.638 --> 06:56.697
It's like nothing
I've ever come across before.

06:58.842 --> 07:00.968
What is that supposed to mean?

07:01.044 --> 07:03.945
If it's an alloy,
I've no idea of its components.

07:04.013 --> 07:07.709
If it's in its natural state,
I don't know where it comes from.

07:09.084 --> 07:12.109
- Then we will have to make her tell us.
- How?

07:13.821 --> 07:16.846
I had hoped to avoid this
but if there's no other way...

07:16.923 --> 07:20.324
She doesn't seem like the kind of woman
who's easily intimidated.

07:20.393 --> 07:23.850
She's just a child.
She won't be able to hold out long.

07:24.897 --> 07:26.363
You know, I wonder.

07:26.764 --> 07:27.753
What?

07:28.766 --> 07:30.893
Remember that young girl
I was telling you about?

07:30.969 --> 07:34.062
The one that was attracted to me.
The schoolgirl crush.

07:35.439 --> 07:36.769
Maybe...

07:38.274 --> 07:40.299
I'd like to try something.

07:41.710 --> 07:45.840
You want to see if your masculine charms
work on this one, too?

07:46.481 --> 07:49.643
If it doesn't work,
you can always do it your way.

07:50.050 --> 07:51.312
Very well.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.304
Are you all right?

08:22.744 --> 08:24.267
Yes, I think so.

08:24.344 --> 08:27.643
They got pretty mad
when you threw them around like that.

08:27.714 --> 08:29.340
They took it out on me.

08:29.448 --> 08:31.939
I've seen you before,
you're Wonder Woman.

08:32.018 --> 08:33.918
My name's Peter Knight.

08:34.085 --> 08:35.347
Yes, I know.

08:35.419 --> 08:38.287
You must have seen me that day
the Nazis attacked the airfield.

08:38.390 --> 08:39.378
Yes.

08:40.224 --> 08:42.124
You're the designer of the XPJ-1.

08:42.192 --> 08:44.887
Yes. They're trying to force me
to tell them about it.

08:44.961 --> 08:46.792
- You haven't, have you?
- No, not yet.

08:46.863 --> 08:50.229
I just don't know whether
I will be able to hold out much longer.

08:50.298 --> 08:51.822
You've got to.

08:52.434 --> 08:54.527
That's easy for you to say.

08:55.169 --> 08:57.296
You're strong and capable.

08:59.507 --> 09:01.064
You must understand...

09:01.908 --> 09:04.502
we have to get out of here.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.472
Come, sit down.

09:06.545 --> 09:08.445
How are we going to do that?

09:10.449 --> 09:12.507
You have these powers. I've seen you.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.881
You're super strong,
you can deflect bullets.

09:14.952 --> 09:18.751
But not without my Feminum bracelets.
They took them from me.

09:19.056 --> 09:20.080
What's Feminum?

09:20.157 --> 09:22.488
It's the metal
that we make the bracelets from.

09:22.558 --> 09:24.458
- I've never heard of it.
- You wouldn't have.

09:24.527 --> 09:26.619
There's only one source of it in the world.

09:26.695 --> 09:27.821
Where's that?

09:28.163 --> 09:30.563
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

09:30.632 --> 09:33.327
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course I do.

09:33.901 --> 09:35.266
It's just that...

09:35.335 --> 09:37.734
That's one of
the very first commandments...

09:37.937 --> 09:40.770
"Never tell anyone about Paradise Island. "

09:42.607 --> 09:44.040
Oh, dear.

09:45.277 --> 09:47.142
I've gone and told you.

09:48.679 --> 09:51.580
No, you didn't.
I still don't know where it is.

09:51.716 --> 09:55.811
There's no such place as Paradise Island.

09:55.885 --> 09:58.011
- Unless you know exactly...
- That's what she said.

09:58.087 --> 10:00.055
...you could sail by it...
- You heard her?

10:00.122 --> 10:01.680
...and never really see it.

10:01.957 --> 10:04.754
I think it has something to
do with refraction.

10:04.826 --> 10:06.453
Light refraction?

10:07.228 --> 10:08.592
I'm not sure.

10:08.662 --> 10:11.722
I really didn't pay enough attention
in my science class.

10:11.865 --> 10:14.697
When you go there yourself,
how do you find it?

10:14.767 --> 10:17.167
That's easy. I know where it is.

10:17.236 --> 10:18.998
Tell me where it is.

10:20.438 --> 10:23.407
That way,
if we ever get out of here alive...

10:23.842 --> 10:25.832
I'll be able to visit you.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.505
Honestly. I can't.

10:29.246 --> 10:31.236
It must be heaven there, though.

10:31.647 --> 10:33.979
I'll bet the moon's full all the time.

10:34.283 --> 10:37.513
Silly. That's an astronomical impossibility.

10:38.854 --> 10:40.650
But Orion...

10:40.721 --> 10:43.212
sometimes it seems
just about as bright as the moon.

10:43.290 --> 10:44.985
Orion in the west?

10:45.158 --> 10:47.718
No, the east. Don't you know anything?

10:47.794 --> 10:50.387
In direct conjunction with Glorianna.

10:50.796 --> 10:52.730
Minus five degrees, actually.

10:53.165 --> 10:55.565
- You do know...
- Is Vega bright, too?

10:56.400 --> 10:59.267
Not so bright, but Castor...

10:59.337 --> 11:00.497
That's it.

11:00.571 --> 11:02.504
...sometimes Castor feels like...

11:02.572 --> 11:04.164
Let's get him out of there.

11:04.241 --> 11:05.299
...reach up and touch it.

11:10.813 --> 11:12.109
Take him.

11:12.347 --> 11:14.838
- What are you going to do with him?
- Out!

11:15.150 --> 11:18.880
- What are they going to do with you?
- I don't know. Goodbye.

11:18.952 --> 11:21.216
No, it's no use, Wonder Woman.

11:21.755 --> 11:23.415
Take care of yourself.

11:24.624 --> 11:26.057
I'm ready.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.000
There's nothing there.

11:39.235 --> 11:41.294
That's it. I'll swear to it.

11:41.704 --> 11:43.728
You had better be right.

11:44.673 --> 11:47.665
- What do you want me to do with her?
- Nothing, she may be lying.

11:47.743 --> 11:50.233
If so, we will want to speak to her again.

11:51.012 --> 11:52.001
My way.

11:53.313 --> 11:57.147
You go to the airfield now.
The XPJ-1 is your only concern.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.580
What are you gonna do?

11:58.651 --> 12:00.209
Radio Berlin.

12:04.255 --> 12:06.587
This is what they've been waiting for.

12:13.163 --> 12:15.687
Yes, thank you very much.

12:17.667 --> 12:19.328
Any news of Drusilla?

12:19.402 --> 12:22.336
None.
The police assure me they're still looking.

12:23.104 --> 12:25.435
- I'm sorry, Diana.
- Thank you.

12:25.506 --> 12:27.406
I appreciate your concern.

12:32.278 --> 12:34.940
General Blankenship wanted you
to see this right away.

12:35.014 --> 12:35.945
What is it?

12:36.014 --> 12:39.450
One of our Navy ships intercepted
what they think is a Nazi signal.

12:39.518 --> 12:42.645
- Emanating from where?
- Somewhere off the Florida coast.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.950
It was routed
through our Enemy Intelligence.

12:45.022 --> 12:46.386
Thank you.

12:51.427 --> 12:52.689
Strange.

12:52.795 --> 12:56.128
There's been no enemy activity
in that area before.

13:01.602 --> 13:03.160
What's happening?

13:03.237 --> 13:06.070
The Nazis are ordering up
a land attack force.

13:06.139 --> 13:08.538
- But there's no land there.
- Where?

13:08.941 --> 13:10.340
Right there.

13:10.409 --> 13:14.242
30, 22 north. 64, 47 west.

13:16.381 --> 13:18.245
Paradise Island.

13:23.152 --> 13:27.179
I've decided to take your advice.
Perhaps Drusilla did go home after all.

13:27.657 --> 13:28.953
I'd like some leave.

13:29.024 --> 13:30.753
Certainly. Anything I can do to help?

13:30.826 --> 13:33.055
- Arrange transportation or something?
- Thank you, no.

13:33.127 --> 13:34.788
I have my own transportation.

13:50.475 --> 13:51.806
Mother!

13:51.876 --> 13:54.309
Darling! Diana, my child!

13:54.444 --> 13:56.469
How lovely to see you again!

13:56.546 --> 13:58.241
So good to be back, Mother.

13:58.315 --> 14:01.112
Let me see you. How nice you look.

14:02.685 --> 14:04.175
Is Drusilla here?

14:04.253 --> 14:06.117
No, I thought she was with you.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.447
Then she's disappeared.

14:08.523 --> 14:12.356
Disappeared? She's so young.
How did she manage that?

14:12.693 --> 14:14.285
I don't know, Mother.

14:14.361 --> 14:17.625
But I think it has something to do
with some very bad news.

14:17.697 --> 14:18.686
Oh?

14:19.766 --> 14:22.290
The Nazis know about Paradise Island.

14:22.367 --> 14:24.892
I believe that they're going to attack us.

14:24.970 --> 14:27.369
What would the Nazis want with us?

14:28.172 --> 14:31.299
In my identity as Wonder Woman,
they know many things about me...

14:31.374 --> 14:33.308
and about the Feminum bracelets.

14:33.376 --> 14:35.900
I believe it's the Feminum they want.

14:35.978 --> 14:37.912
What are we going to do to stop them?

14:37.980 --> 14:41.040
Defend the mine,
with our lives if necessary.

14:41.783 --> 14:42.772
Daughter...

14:43.117 --> 14:45.017
why don't you take charge?

14:45.086 --> 14:46.450
Of course.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.924
I'll take Dalma, Magda,
and just a few others.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.355
Why so few?

14:52.692 --> 14:54.717
We don't want to alarm everyone.

14:54.794 --> 14:57.591
Fortunately, the mine is located
in a remote spot...

14:57.662 --> 14:59.357
on the other side of the Island.

14:59.431 --> 15:00.898
We'll leave for there in two hours.

15:00.966 --> 15:02.956
- Diana, darling.
- Yes, Mother?

15:03.033 --> 15:05.467
Why don't you just reason
with your Nazis?

15:06.003 --> 15:09.130
Mother, would you take my word for it?

15:09.205 --> 15:11.799
There is no reasoning with the Nazis.

15:13.008 --> 15:14.908
Don't you believe me?

15:15.277 --> 15:17.972
Of course, I do. Run along, dear.

15:42.065 --> 15:43.965
Captain Radl,
how nice to have you aboard.

15:44.034 --> 15:47.196
Thank you, you make
parachuting into Caribbean sound...

15:47.269 --> 15:49.134
almost pleasant.

15:49.838 --> 15:52.204
What are you intelligence types
up to now?

15:52.273 --> 15:55.469
I have orders to land you
and some of my best men on an island...

15:55.542 --> 15:57.635
- that doesn't exist.
- It exists.

15:57.711 --> 16:00.008
Then why isn't it marked
on any of my charts?

16:00.079 --> 16:02.445
I don't know why it isn't marked.

16:02.982 --> 16:04.472
But if you wish...

16:04.550 --> 16:07.609
we can take the whole matter up
with high command.

16:08.553 --> 16:10.543
That won't be necessary.

16:11.455 --> 16:14.253
Now, we're going overland to the mine.

16:14.325 --> 16:18.124
Should anyone ask, we're merely
going on a hunting trip.

16:18.995 --> 16:21.724
We don't want to cause
unnecessary alarm.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.225
The whole thing sounds like enormous fun.

16:24.299 --> 16:27.529
It may be many things, Dalma,
but it won't be fun.

16:27.735 --> 16:29.669
Ladies! Are we ready?

16:29.737 --> 16:31.567
Mother, what are you doing here?

16:31.638 --> 16:34.163
- I'm going with you.
- But you put me in command.

16:34.241 --> 16:36.800
Yes, you're still in command.

16:37.276 --> 16:40.803
But these are my people,
my island, and my responsibility.

16:42.714 --> 16:45.012
- I'm going with you.
- Very well.

16:45.083 --> 16:47.141
- Are we ready?
- Yes, of course, Princess.

16:47.217 --> 16:49.048
Then let's go.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.786
We have to be there before dawn.

16:53.189 --> 16:56.317
These Nazis don't stand a chance
against my Amazons.

16:56.392 --> 16:58.325
Don't be too sure, Mother.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.328
They're clever and devious, like most men.

17:01.763 --> 17:04.492
Like your American friend, Major Trevor?

17:05.332 --> 17:09.061
He's clever, but he doesn't have
a devious bone in his body.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.068
You should know, Daughter.

17:13.439 --> 17:14.701
Mother!

17:39.626 --> 17:41.025
Hi, Steve.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.330
- How's it looking?
- Really good.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.959
How's it going?
She'll be ready for tomorrow?

17:52.037 --> 17:53.265
I think so.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.464
Listen, I've signed on
a new chief mechanic.

17:55.539 --> 17:58.030
I'd like you to meet him.
He's brilliant. Harvey!

17:58.109 --> 18:01.271
Come on over here.
I want you to meet Major Steve Trevor.

18:01.911 --> 18:04.744
Where's Diana today
and that cute little sister of hers?

18:04.814 --> 18:07.509
She had urgent family business,
went home for a while.

18:07.583 --> 18:09.016
I think Dru's there, too.

18:09.084 --> 18:11.517
They're nice girls.
Hope it's nothing to worry about.

18:11.586 --> 18:13.611
No, Diana's very capable. She'll handle it.

18:13.688 --> 18:16.178
Harvey Manning, Major Steve Trevor.

18:16.256 --> 18:18.087
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, sir.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.763
- Any sign of them, Daughter?
- No, Mother, none.

18:32.669 --> 18:35.502
Perhaps you were wrong.
Perhaps they won't attack.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.630
They'll attack, all right.

18:38.474 --> 18:41.602
Well, it's way past dawn,
and there's no sign of them.

18:42.410 --> 18:45.937
There's one important thing I learned
from my time in the United States...

18:46.014 --> 18:48.777
reading all the war reports,
battling the enemy.

18:49.283 --> 18:51.979
They are cruel, inhuman, and barbaric...

18:53.052 --> 18:55.111
but they are predictable.

18:56.389 --> 18:58.118
They'll be here.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.547
What are you doing?

19:38.123 --> 19:40.113
You're supposed to be on lookout.

19:40.191 --> 19:43.649
If I had been a Nazi, all of our defensive
planning would've been wasted.

19:43.727 --> 19:45.591
Diana, you worry too much.

19:45.695 --> 19:47.322
Come join us in a game.

19:47.397 --> 19:49.331
Please, you must keep a lookout.

19:49.399 --> 19:51.263
If the Nazis catch us unaware...

19:51.333 --> 19:54.097
Diana, tell us again about the Nazi men.

19:54.169 --> 19:57.001
- Blonde hair, the blue eyes.
- What are they like?

19:57.071 --> 19:58.538
I've told you this before.

19:59.373 --> 20:01.034
They are not like other men.

20:01.107 --> 20:03.166
They destroy what they cannot control.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.972
But I thought all men were like that.

20:05.045 --> 20:07.410
There are some good men
in the outside world.

20:07.479 --> 20:10.710
They are the ones we must help
defeat the Nazis.

20:12.417 --> 20:15.011
Maybe we'll greet the Nazis,
and welcome them...

20:15.086 --> 20:17.610
and find out for ourselves
what they're really like.

20:17.688 --> 20:20.748
You'll have to take my word
for what they're really like.

20:20.824 --> 20:24.259
You'll both now stand lookout
and be on guard for them.

20:24.327 --> 20:25.885
Yes, Princess.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.633
Over there, to the right.

20:57.053 --> 21:00.954
I think Diana's sojourn in America
has done her no good at all.

21:07.228 --> 21:09.991
I don't care what Diana says,
I think they're cute.

21:10.063 --> 21:13.624
They're not very strong
but you're right, they are cute.

21:16.702 --> 21:19.262
Please, don't. We just want to be friends.

21:19.338 --> 21:21.396
That's not very friendly.

21:23.108 --> 21:25.632
Why do they have to be so stubborn?

22:01.572 --> 22:03.505
Wait till I contact Berlin and tell them...

22:03.573 --> 22:06.269
we've conquered a whole island
of Wonder Women.

22:15.784 --> 22:17.546
Here's something to eat.

22:17.618 --> 22:20.451
It may not be good but at least it's hot.

22:49.610 --> 22:51.771
General Blankenship's office.

22:51.846 --> 22:55.645
I'm sorry, Major Trevor is out of town.
I'm taking his calls.

22:56.283 --> 22:59.377
Drusilla, where have you been?
We've all been frantic...

22:59.452 --> 23:00.942
It's Drusilla.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.044
This is General Blankenship.

23:03.122 --> 23:05.589
- Where have you been, young lady?
- I'll tell you later.

23:05.657 --> 23:08.649
- But for now, I need to speak to Diana.
- She's gone on leave.

23:08.727 --> 23:10.387
Then let me speak with Major Trevor.

23:10.461 --> 23:13.396
He's out at the airport. Now listen to me.

23:13.464 --> 23:15.226
I think you should...

23:16.833 --> 23:18.300
We've been disconnected.

23:18.368 --> 23:20.801
- Call her back at Diana's apartment.
- Yes, sir.

23:29.844 --> 23:31.777
Who are you and how did you get in here?

23:31.845 --> 23:33.642
I'm Major Trevor's niece.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.772
Get in. I'll take you to see Major Trevor.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.941
He should keep better tabs
on his relatives.

23:38.016 --> 23:39.608
Let's go. Get in.

24:03.170 --> 24:06.003
All right, young lady.
Suppose you tell me where you've been.

24:06.073 --> 24:07.972
We've all been worried about you.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.474
I was taken prisoner by the Nazis.

24:10.676 --> 24:12.200
Come on, Dru.

24:12.412 --> 24:14.242
You can do better than that.

24:14.946 --> 24:17.073
Why would anybody
wanna take you prisoner?

24:17.149 --> 24:19.275
I don't know, but they did.

24:19.850 --> 24:22.182
And they know about the XPJ-1.

24:23.653 --> 24:25.314
And Peter's dead.

24:25.955 --> 24:28.048
- Peter who?
- Peter Knight.

24:28.824 --> 24:31.691
They tortured him
and then they killed him.

24:34.429 --> 24:35.760
Come here.

24:36.864 --> 24:38.092
Look out there.

24:38.166 --> 24:40.656
Tell me that again about Peter Knight.

24:43.937 --> 24:45.335
He escaped.

24:45.938 --> 24:48.463
He didn't escape.
He hasn't been anywhere.

24:48.541 --> 24:49.700
He took one morning off.

24:49.774 --> 24:52.834
Apart from that, he's been here
at the airfield all the time.

24:52.911 --> 24:56.641
Now suppose you tell me the truth.
What have you been up to?

25:00.249 --> 25:01.739
Where's Diana?

25:02.418 --> 25:05.978
She went home. She took some leave.
She was worried about you.

25:06.521 --> 25:08.921
- She wouldn't have gone there.
- She did.

25:08.990 --> 25:11.116
She was extremely concerned, I know her.

25:11.192 --> 25:14.025
If she went home,
it was for some other reason.

25:14.094 --> 25:15.561
We'll discuss that later.

25:15.629 --> 25:18.392
Why are you telling me all this nonsense
about Peter Knight?

25:18.465 --> 25:20.330
It's not nonsense.

25:21.433 --> 25:24.459
- Was he really there the whole time?
- He has.

25:26.404 --> 25:28.372
Except for the morning before last.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.532
Right. He was working on...

25:31.741 --> 25:34.710
How did you know
it was day before yesterday?

25:35.779 --> 25:39.077
Major Trevor, he's a Nazi spy.

25:39.815 --> 25:41.043
Peter?

25:42.484 --> 25:44.179
He's a Nazi spy.

25:44.252 --> 25:45.810
If you don't believe me...

25:45.887 --> 25:48.980
ask him about Captain Radl
and Mr. Harris...

25:49.323 --> 25:52.315
and how the Nazis knew about the XPJ-1...

25:52.392 --> 25:54.552
and where was he the other morning...

25:54.627 --> 25:58.187
and how they knew that the General and I
were leaving when we did.

26:00.265 --> 26:02.130
You're serious, aren't you?

26:02.200 --> 26:03.996
Of course I am.

26:07.872 --> 26:09.862
All right, I will ask him.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.065
But you stay here.

26:24.084 --> 26:26.245
- Peter.
- Hi, Steve.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.511
Where did you go the other morning?

26:28.588 --> 26:30.578
- Why?
- I need to know.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.323
I had to see someone, personal business.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.052
Captain Radl?

26:36.427 --> 26:38.918
- Who's Captain Radl?
- You tell me.

26:40.764 --> 26:42.254
I don't know.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.529
- What's this all about?
- I'm not sure yet.

26:46.802 --> 26:49.430
Someone's made some
serious allegations against you.

26:49.505 --> 26:51.904
I owe it to everyone
to have them checked out.

26:51.973 --> 26:55.238
Until I do, I'm taking you off the XPJ-1.

26:55.576 --> 26:58.670
Come on, Steve, that's ridiculous.

26:59.413 --> 27:01.141
Who made these allegations?

27:01.214 --> 27:02.408
A young girl.

27:02.482 --> 27:04.211
She said she was kidnapped by the Nazis.

27:04.284 --> 27:06.114
Perhaps you had something to do with it...

27:12.690 --> 27:15.056
Put that man in the guardhouse.

27:51.388 --> 27:54.220
No, Mother, I cannot do it.

27:55.625 --> 27:56.922
You must.

27:56.993 --> 27:59.790
With me here under guard,
you're next in line to lead.

27:59.861 --> 28:03.728
And you must lead our Amazons
to victory over these evil men.

28:04.198 --> 28:05.893
- But, Mother...
- No.

28:07.168 --> 28:09.192
You must have no concern for me.

28:09.336 --> 28:12.362
They've threatened your life
if I try to do anything.

28:17.443 --> 28:18.876
Dear, Daughter...

28:19.078 --> 28:21.204
I am pleased by your concern.

28:22.146 --> 28:25.740
But my safety is unimportant
as long as my people are imprisoned.

28:26.049 --> 28:27.744
Now, when you're Queen...

28:28.018 --> 28:31.111
you will know that no ruler
is truly safe or secure...

28:31.387 --> 28:33.514
as long as her people are not free.

28:33.589 --> 28:37.615
You must do everything in your power
to defeat these evil men...

28:37.726 --> 28:40.286
who've invaded our island paradise.

28:40.494 --> 28:41.961
Good morning.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.288
It's time you joined the others at work.

28:55.107 --> 28:57.404
I trust madame is comfortable.

29:00.044 --> 29:02.238
Your subjects are very good workers.

29:03.146 --> 29:05.774
Especially when they know
what'll happen to their queen...

29:05.849 --> 29:07.543
if they do not work.

29:07.950 --> 29:10.714
They're extraordinary fighters as well.

29:11.220 --> 29:15.485
We have already disproven that
and there is no rematch scheduled.

29:16.758 --> 29:19.385
What has happened
to my other daughter in America?

29:19.459 --> 29:22.484
Yes, the information she gave us
was accurate.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.927
She'll have been killed by now.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.225
You couldn't.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.287
Madame...

29:27.732 --> 29:29.165
we are at war.

29:29.334 --> 29:32.531
That is no justification
for killing innocent people.

29:33.270 --> 29:34.669
I'm sorry.

29:40.643 --> 29:42.235
What's going to happen?

29:43.146 --> 29:44.635
I don't know.

29:45.213 --> 29:48.205
But I will think of some way
we can defeat them.

29:50.551 --> 29:53.384
You two women!
Stop that talking over there.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.181
You keep it quiet!

29:57.957 --> 30:00.151
I've heard from headquarters.

30:00.225 --> 30:03.160
They're diverting a cargo vessel
from the South American run...

30:03.228 --> 30:05.525
- to pick up the ore.
- How long before it arrives?

30:05.596 --> 30:07.325
Three or four days.

30:07.865 --> 30:10.594
We'll have this mine picked clean by then.

30:10.667 --> 30:11.759
What about them?

30:11.835 --> 30:15.031
Berlin is interested in where
they get their strength and longevity.

30:15.104 --> 30:19.040
We're to send them to Berlin
for a study and possible breeding.

30:22.577 --> 30:24.670
Here, work! Keep working!

30:24.746 --> 30:27.043
You will continue mining the Feminum.

31:44.843 --> 31:46.834
Dru, it's so good to see you.

31:50.181 --> 31:52.877
I've been so worried about you.
Where have you been?

31:52.950 --> 31:56.441
See, I was taken prisoner by the Nazis
and it slipped out.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.715
Dru, what're you telling me?
What slipped?

31:58.789 --> 32:00.949
The location of Paradise Island.

32:01.056 --> 32:02.353
I'm sorry, Diana.

32:02.458 --> 32:04.948
I know everything's terrible,
and I caused it.

32:05.026 --> 32:07.324
- It's my fault.
- No. It's all right.

32:07.662 --> 32:09.254
It's not your fault.

32:10.197 --> 32:13.598
We'll just have to devise a way
to defeat them, that's all.

32:13.834 --> 32:14.926
How?

32:15.035 --> 32:17.502
There are eight of them plus two officers.

32:17.904 --> 32:20.872
We'll have to get our bracelets back
without them knowing it.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.406
How can we?

32:22.474 --> 32:24.533
Here's how we're going to do it.

32:37.386 --> 32:39.445
Dru, what are you doing here?

32:40.189 --> 32:41.712
Take this.

33:03.540 --> 33:06.202
Captain, you Nazis...

33:06.510 --> 33:09.069
what is it you hope to gain by this war?

33:09.145 --> 33:10.874
Living space, Madame.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.506
The Third Reich needs living space.

33:13.815 --> 33:15.578
The entire world?

33:16.017 --> 33:17.507
If necessary.

33:20.888 --> 33:23.322
You hit me one more time,
I'm gonna do something.

33:23.390 --> 33:26.187
- What are you gonna do?
- Just try it and you'll see.

33:26.993 --> 33:28.358
Break that up.

33:34.398 --> 33:36.491
You stay here, Your Majesty.

33:45.407 --> 33:46.601
Diana, quickly.

33:46.675 --> 33:49.473
The bracelets he took from our people
are here in the pack.

33:49.545 --> 33:51.341
Hurry before he returns.

33:55.582 --> 33:57.174
Stop fighting! Hold it!

33:58.518 --> 33:59.644
Stop!

33:59.753 --> 34:01.743
You'd be better served...

34:01.821 --> 34:04.221
by saving your energy for work.

34:04.290 --> 34:06.553
Any more trouble
and one of you will be shot.

34:06.625 --> 34:08.353
Is that understood?

34:12.362 --> 34:13.887
Get on with it.

34:16.766 --> 34:18.666
- He's coming now.
- Go!

34:28.442 --> 34:30.069
Now, where were we?

34:30.244 --> 34:33.041
You were telling me why
the Treaty of Versailles...

34:33.112 --> 34:34.774
was so abhorrent to you.

34:34.848 --> 34:37.940
Thank you, most gracious.
Yes, the Treaty of Versailles.

34:46.791 --> 34:47.949
Magda!

34:54.063 --> 34:55.860
Take these bracelets.

34:55.965 --> 34:59.058
Tell the others to get theirs
as they come down.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.891
Hans, it's time for our relief.

35:43.403 --> 35:45.393
Hans, what are you up to?

35:50.709 --> 35:52.370
Lieutenant Weil!

36:01.384 --> 36:03.375
- What's the matter?
- Private Stucker, sir. He doesn't answer.

36:03.453 --> 36:06.683
If he's left his post,
I'll court-martial him.

36:11.892 --> 36:13.519
What shall we do?

36:13.861 --> 36:16.193
Take them, it's our only chance.

36:18.798 --> 36:20.925
Stucker, where are you?

36:22.034 --> 36:23.865
Lazy swine, I told you...

36:53.526 --> 36:55.187
Well done, sisters!

37:03.035 --> 37:06.561
You will release my men
and take off those bracelets...

37:06.637 --> 37:08.571
or this old woman will die.

37:09.172 --> 37:11.800
Ladies, ignore him. I beg of you.

37:14.244 --> 37:15.938
Daughter, I command you!

37:17.446 --> 37:20.346
- I mean what I say.
- I know you do.

37:23.151 --> 37:24.641
Do as he says.

37:41.532 --> 37:43.864
- Captain Radl.
- Madame?

37:44.368 --> 37:47.666
Did I understand you to call me
an "old woman"?

37:48.671 --> 37:49.968
You did.

37:50.506 --> 37:52.905
That's what I thought you said. Diana!

37:54.109 --> 37:56.542
Would you care to discuss it further?

37:57.611 --> 37:59.010
Go on, shoot.

37:59.080 --> 38:02.480
That's what you came here for, isn't it?
But you know what will happen?

38:02.549 --> 38:07.008
Or you could admit defeat
by an "old woman" and drop your gun.

38:23.032 --> 38:24.021
Darling.

38:26.001 --> 38:29.026
Well, that really wasn't very bad at all.

38:29.104 --> 38:31.163
I'm terribly proud of both of you.

38:31.239 --> 38:33.536
And we are very proud
to be your daughters.

38:33.607 --> 38:37.976
Even in the face of death, you were
the best possible example we could have.

38:38.711 --> 38:43.080
How could I think of my own safety,
when I was so worried about all of you?

38:44.950 --> 38:46.941
Drusilla, my dear, listen to me.

38:47.018 --> 38:50.418
I sent you, a young girl,
into a strange land...

38:50.488 --> 38:52.115
to do a woman's job.

38:52.189 --> 38:54.019
Now, it's true, you made mistakes.

38:54.090 --> 38:58.550
But you did come back and help us
rid our island of those dreadful Nazis.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.060
And you, my daughter...

39:00.129 --> 39:02.825
not only did you make our island
safe again...

39:02.898 --> 39:04.365
but you made me very happy...

39:04.433 --> 39:07.196
with your concern
over my personal safety.

39:10.036 --> 39:13.403
Truly I am blessed to have
two such lovely daughters.

39:13.974 --> 39:16.134
But now I've had enough
of this outdoor life.

39:16.208 --> 39:19.939
I want to get back to the palace
and to some civilized comforts.

39:20.179 --> 39:22.112
And what happens to them?

39:23.114 --> 39:25.014
I have plans for them.

39:28.952 --> 39:31.476
- You understand, Sonya?
- Perfectly, Majesty.

39:31.654 --> 39:33.144
A complete blank.

39:33.222 --> 39:36.315
They'll remember nothing
that has occurred in the last seven days.

39:36.391 --> 39:38.018
Good. Thank you.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.018
Girls, come in.

39:40.529 --> 39:43.622
I was just discussing the prisoners' fate
with Sonya.

39:43.697 --> 39:45.187
And what is it to be?

39:45.266 --> 39:48.166
They are to be given the drug
from the Hibernian tree.

39:48.234 --> 39:50.202
- The memory-blocking drug.
- That's right.

39:50.270 --> 39:53.033
They'll remember nothing
about Paradise Island...

39:53.138 --> 39:56.164
and then we'll put them
in their rubber boats and set them adrift.

39:56.241 --> 39:59.471
And you, Daughter,
you are to call the United States Navy...

39:59.544 --> 40:03.479
and they'll come and pick them up
and intern them for the rest of the war.

40:03.547 --> 40:07.846
No, Mother. Thanks to me,
the Nazis know about Paradise Island.

40:08.150 --> 40:09.583
They're sure to send others.

40:09.652 --> 40:10.949
No, darling.

40:11.020 --> 40:14.216
They're not certain that the information
you gave them was correct.

40:14.289 --> 40:15.313
Captain Radl told me.

40:15.390 --> 40:18.847
As a matter of fact,
they may even think that you lied.

40:19.059 --> 40:20.356
Lie! Me?

40:20.527 --> 40:23.495
I know it is impossible for you to lie.

40:23.563 --> 40:27.021
But men don't know that.
They lie all the time.

40:27.633 --> 40:30.829
I found that out.
Peter was the worst of all.

40:31.670 --> 40:33.137
Peter Knight?

40:33.505 --> 40:35.995
- He's a Nazi spy.
- Does Steve know that?

40:36.440 --> 40:39.033
I told him and he went out to talk to him.

40:39.108 --> 40:41.235
I had to leave
so I don't know what happened.

40:41.311 --> 40:44.245
Mother, I must talk to Captain Radl.
He will know.

40:44.313 --> 40:46.008
Very well. But you'd better hurry...

40:46.081 --> 40:49.846
before Sonya gives him that drug,
or he won't remember a thing.

40:52.653 --> 40:55.018
I'm going to ask you some questions.

40:55.088 --> 40:58.182
And I, reluctantly,
will refuse to answer them.

40:59.192 --> 41:00.852
I don't think so.

41:03.862 --> 41:06.421
Please, what is this game?

41:06.764 --> 41:08.857
Now tell me about Peter Knight.

41:08.933 --> 41:10.524
I have nothing...

41:11.935 --> 41:16.166
He is working for us. He is a spy.

41:16.239 --> 41:18.639
Is he still working on the XPJ-1?

41:18.941 --> 41:21.408
No, his cover was blown.

41:22.711 --> 41:24.144
He was arrested.

41:24.212 --> 41:26.202
So the XPJ-1 is now safe?

41:26.280 --> 41:28.180
Yes... No.

41:29.149 --> 41:32.049
- There's another man.
- Who? What's his name?

41:32.352 --> 41:33.683
Karl Wertz.

41:34.587 --> 41:37.817
He's working undercover
as the chief mechanic on the project.

41:37.889 --> 41:40.915
In fact, he's one of the best pilots
in the Luftwaffe.

41:40.993 --> 41:43.256
Quickly, what name is he using?

41:43.394 --> 41:46.488
Manning. Harvey Manning.

41:46.864 --> 41:50.560
And he plans to fly the XPJ-1,
instead of Steve Trevor...

41:50.634 --> 41:52.567
to a secret landing field they have.

41:52.635 --> 41:55.468
I must return to America
before it's too late.

41:55.537 --> 41:57.731
Darling, I do hate to let you go away...

41:57.805 --> 42:00.239
when you so recently returned
to Paradise Island.

42:00.308 --> 42:03.538
But, Mother, you now know
what the Nazis are like.

42:04.111 --> 42:07.080
Can we afford to let them
win this terrible war?

42:07.180 --> 42:09.579
Of course not. Go then!

42:09.649 --> 42:12.550
Me, too? I can help. I've helped before.

42:12.618 --> 42:15.984
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be prisoners of the Nazis.

42:16.054 --> 42:18.545
Very well, Drusilla.
You may go with my blessing.

42:18.622 --> 42:20.783
But listen, the minute you finish...

42:20.858 --> 42:23.122
you are to come right back home
to Paradise Island.

42:23.193 --> 42:25.183
- Do you...
- Yes, Mother. I understand.

42:25.261 --> 42:26.751
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Goodbye, darling.

42:26.929 --> 42:28.726
Diana, can I fly?

42:32.334 --> 42:34.597
Not this time. I'll do the flying.

42:34.669 --> 42:36.261
Goodbye, Mother.

42:37.004 --> 42:38.232
Goodbye.

42:59.656 --> 43:01.748
Here's a beauty, Steve.

43:02.625 --> 43:05.389
A couple of squadrons of these,
and we'll really show them.

43:05.461 --> 43:09.624
If she does everything they say she does,
I'll agree with you, General.

43:09.831 --> 43:12.856
If you'll excuse me,
I'll go get into my flying clothes.

43:12.933 --> 43:15.060
- I'll see you later.
- Right.

43:39.688 --> 43:41.588
- You stay here.
- But why?

43:41.657 --> 43:43.988
Up to now,
they think there's only one of us.

43:44.058 --> 43:45.821
Better we keep it that way.

43:50.831 --> 43:52.423
Good luck, Steve.

44:18.720 --> 44:19.845
General Blankenship!

44:19.920 --> 44:22.480
Wonder Woman,
you're just in time to see the test flight.

44:22.556 --> 44:24.319
Where's Major Trevor?

44:24.392 --> 44:26.382
Where else? In the XPJ-1.

44:29.562 --> 44:32.359
Where's Harvey Manning,
the chief mechanic?

44:33.599 --> 44:34.588
I don't know.

44:38.703 --> 44:41.603
I can't take the chance.
If it's Steve, he'll forgive me.

44:41.671 --> 44:43.536
If not, he'll thank me.

45:02.822 --> 45:05.655
Control, this is XPJ-1 ready for takeoff.

45:08.293 --> 45:09.783
She must be crazy.

45:10.128 --> 45:12.288
Roger, Steve. You're cleared for takeoff.

45:51.895 --> 45:54.795
Steve! Then who...

45:55.298 --> 45:56.492
Come on!

46:09.109 --> 46:10.666
Thank you, Wonder Woman.

46:10.743 --> 46:13.268
- Are you all right, Steve?
- It's just a bruise. Thanks.

46:13.346 --> 46:15.176
I'd like to take her up now, sir.

46:15.247 --> 46:17.738
- Are you sure you're fit?
- I'm fine.

46:18.917 --> 46:22.113
- We'll talk after the flight.
- Good luck, Steve.

46:31.794 --> 46:33.728
Isn't he wonderful?

46:39.701 --> 46:40.860
Hello.

47:27.973 --> 47:30.497
She's everything they said she was, sir,
and more.

47:30.575 --> 47:32.566
- Well done, Steve.
- Thank you, sir.

47:32.644 --> 47:34.440
What happened to Wertz?
Did they catch him?

47:34.511 --> 47:36.741
Yes. The poor man's lost his mind.

47:36.813 --> 47:40.009
He gave himself up,
babbling about a 15-year-old girl...

47:40.082 --> 47:42.175
with the strength of 10 men.

47:42.251 --> 47:44.514
An intern camp will take care of that, sir.

47:44.586 --> 47:46.486
Excuse me, Steve.
I want to check her over.

47:46.555 --> 47:48.750
- Where's Wonder Woman?
- I don't know.

47:48.823 --> 47:50.312
I think she had to leave.

47:50.391 --> 47:52.621
Diana, it's good to have you back.

47:52.693 --> 47:53.682
It's good to be back.

47:53.761 --> 47:56.126
- Is everything all right at home?
- Everything's fine.

47:56.195 --> 47:57.355
I'm fine, too.

47:57.430 --> 48:00.398
Dru, where have you been?
You had us all worried half to death.

48:00.465 --> 48:02.490
Well, to tell you the truth, I was on...

48:02.568 --> 48:04.559
It's a long story, Steve...

48:04.636 --> 48:08.071
and let's just say
that Dru is acting like a teenager.

48:08.639 --> 48:12.699
The really important thing is that
she's back with us and safe, isn't it?

48:12.776 --> 48:13.765
That's right, Diana.

48:13.843 --> 48:16.333
But don't you scare us
like that again, okay?

48:16.412 --> 48:17.674
Yes, sir.

48:19.081 --> 48:21.378
You know,
it's too bad about Wonder Woman.

48:21.449 --> 48:22.882
I wanted to thank her.

48:22.951 --> 48:25.181
Tell her once again
how much I appreciate her help.

48:25.253 --> 48:26.947
I'm sure she knows that.

48:27.020 --> 48:28.851
Didn't you get that impression, Dru?

48:28.922 --> 48:30.321
Yes, I did.

48:30.891 --> 48:33.882
This calls for a celebration.
And it's on me.

48:35.461 --> 48:37.360
You really know how to cut a rug.

48:37.429 --> 48:40.262
- I know how to dance, too.
- That's what I said.

48:41.299 --> 48:44.859
- Can I have some more ice cream?
- More?

48:45.235 --> 48:47.930
Yeah, there's still three flavors
I haven't tasted yet.

48:48.037 --> 48:49.334
Yeah, I guess so.

48:49.639 --> 48:50.731
Neat!

48:54.543 --> 48:56.602
She really enjoys Washington.

48:56.678 --> 48:58.804
Why don't you let her stay,
just for a few days?

48:58.879 --> 49:00.403
I'd love to...

49:00.548 --> 49:02.879
but one of us should be at home,
with our mother.

49:02.949 --> 49:04.917
Well, I sure don't want you to go.

49:04.985 --> 49:06.543
- You don't?
- No.

49:06.653 --> 49:08.552
You're the best secretary I've ever had.

49:08.621 --> 49:11.283
It would take me weeks to replace you.

49:14.092 --> 49:15.491
I'm just kidding.

49:15.560 --> 49:19.723
The truth is, you're irreplaceable.
And I don't mean just as a secretary.
