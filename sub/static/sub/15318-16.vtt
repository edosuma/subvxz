that the gateway

11:05.683 --> 11:08.686
Laid to rest... "Here."

11:12.725 --> 11:13.825
[Latch clunks]

11:13.827 --> 11:15.827
[Stone grinding]

11:19.799 --> 11:22.435
Good heavens.

11:23.470 --> 11:26.438
It's the Queen of the Vampires.

11:32.185 --> 11:34.353
Just think, Nikola.

11:34.355 --> 11:36.256
We're the first people
to see this tomb

11:36.258 --> 11:37.291
in thousands of years.

11:39.828 --> 11:41.763
Nikola, no!
What are you doing?

11:41.765 --> 11:43.632
[EPI pen hisses]

11:43.634 --> 11:44.633
[Gasps]

11:44.635 --> 11:45.534
Help me up.

11:45.536 --> 11:46.735
Are you out of your mind?

11:46.737 --> 11:48.471
I'm not missing out on this.

11:48.473 --> 11:49.406
Help me up.

11:49.408 --> 11:50.707
Come on.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.442
[Wincing]

11:57.682 --> 11:59.316
[Gasping]

11:59.318 --> 12:00.450
Look at her.

12:01.585 --> 12:02.586
Perfectly preserved,

12:02.588 --> 12:04.321
like an insect in amber.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.658
They must have mastered
crystal replication

12:07.660 --> 12:08.526
on an atomic level.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.894
Oh, don't sound so surprised.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.230
These are vampires
we're talking about after all.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.533
Every advance we've seen
in our lifetimes,

12:15.535 --> 12:17.469
nothing but a pathetic attempt
to recreate

12:17.471 --> 12:19.371
what my race achieved

12:19.373 --> 12:20.606
before the humans
even left the caves.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.244
Just leave me here
among vampire royalty,

12:25.246 --> 12:26.446
my only peers.

12:29.617 --> 12:31.585
I have a better idea.

12:39.494 --> 12:40.527
Move aside.

12:40.529 --> 12:41.995
What are you doing?

12:41.997 --> 12:43.463
If there is even
an ounce of fluid

12:43.465 --> 12:45.531
in that corpse,

12:45.533 --> 12:48.167
a few cells of unaltered
vampire DNA...

12:48.169 --> 12:50.402
Helen, I'm shocked.

12:50.404 --> 12:52.571
Are you offering to re-vamp me?

12:52.573 --> 12:54.373
If you get the hell
out of my way I am.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.875
I have never been
more attracted to you

12:56.877 --> 12:59.411
than I am at this moment.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.849
[Winces]

13:05.319 --> 13:06.654
[Thudding]

13:08.190 --> 13:10.258
Bloody hell, what is
this thing made of?

13:10.260 --> 13:11.493
We need something stronger.

13:13.229 --> 13:16.665
On Praxis, I used
a laser scalpel

13:16.667 --> 13:19.200
to cut through the hide
of an earth-moving abnormal.

13:19.202 --> 13:22.402
Now, it's the same principle,
I just need to focus the beam...

13:22.404 --> 13:25.238
No, no, no, you'll overload
the power condenser.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.272
Do you have
a better idea?

13:28.342 --> 13:30.576
Unprotected platinum coils?

13:30.578 --> 13:31.878
Wolf boy...

13:31.880 --> 13:32.845
Have a word with him
about power efficiency.

13:32.847 --> 13:34.814
I doubt Henry
planned on

13:34.816 --> 13:36.316
this kind of repurposing.

13:36.318 --> 13:37.350
That's no excuse.

13:37.352 --> 13:38.852
Secure the oscillator,

13:38.854 --> 13:40.253
or you'll get
vibration.

13:40.255 --> 13:41.287
Yeah, I got it, thank you.

13:41.289 --> 13:42.289
Yeah, well,

13:42.291 --> 13:43.556
get this wrong,

13:43.558 --> 13:44.891
you might as well pull the pin
on a radiation grenade.

13:44.893 --> 13:48.362
Which is starting to sound
more and more attractive.

13:49.464 --> 13:50.297
All right.

13:50.299 --> 13:51.632
Ready or not...

13:53.001 --> 13:54.902
Time for a field test.

14:05.315 --> 14:06.715
Ah! Damn,
it's overheating.

14:06.717 --> 14:08.617
Yeah, I'd say I told you so,

14:08.619 --> 14:10.420
but, you know,
it wouldn't bring me

14:10.422 --> 14:12.422
much satisfaction.

14:14.358 --> 14:15.625
How deep?

14:15.627 --> 14:17.593
A few millimeters.

14:17.595 --> 14:18.795
[Gasping in pain]

14:23.400 --> 14:26.669
Don't you dare!
This is not over!

14:38.316 --> 14:40.951
[Laser hums and sizzles]

14:48.860 --> 14:50.627
It's not deep enough.

14:50.629 --> 14:52.329
Can we pull out
the explosive core

14:52.331 --> 14:53.530
and pack this borehole?

14:53.532 --> 14:54.831
[Groans]

14:54.833 --> 14:56.733
Nikola, no!

14:56.735 --> 14:57.801
Oh, come on...

14:57.803 --> 14:58.835
Come on!

14:58.837 --> 14:59.703
Nikola...

15:08.680 --> 15:13.318
[Magnus shouts,
stone thuds heavily]

15:13.320 --> 15:14.386
[Crackling]

15:19.658 --> 15:21.526
Bloody hell.

15:23.396 --> 15:25.431
[Shouting]

15:25.433 --> 15:27.033
[Crackling]

15:28.635 --> 15:30.070
Nikola!

15:32.907 --> 15:33.907
Hang in there.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.460
[Tesla grunts]

15:56.363 --> 15:59.097
Oh, come on. Fight!

16:02.768 --> 16:04.001
Fight.

16:07.505 --> 16:09.573
[Snarling]

16:12.776 --> 16:15.511
I'm back, baby.

16:15.513 --> 16:18.114
[Roars in delight]
And it feels good.

16:31.995 --> 16:35.197
Hey, you know
anything about, uh...

16:35.199 --> 16:38.968
Uh, Taminsails?

16:38.970 --> 16:40.403
Yes.

16:40.405 --> 16:42.672
They're an amphibious
abnormal

16:42.674 --> 16:44.740
farmed for
their TSH glands.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.075
It's supposed to give
a powerful high.

16:46.077 --> 16:48.177
Yeah. The buyers
get them as eggs,

16:48.179 --> 16:49.879
they harvest the glands
every six weeks,

16:49.881 --> 16:51.614
and they just
rip 'em out,

16:51.616 --> 16:52.882
no anesthetic.

16:52.884 --> 16:54.183
Yeah, I'd love
to put a stop to it,

16:54.185 --> 16:56.452
but these places come and go,

16:56.454 --> 16:57.654
and the guys behind them
stay hidden.

16:57.656 --> 16:59.122
Well, what if I say

16:59.124 --> 17:00.423
I have a line on
where to find one of them?

17:03.694 --> 17:05.027
Guy named Caster.

17:05.029 --> 17:06.762
Operates out of a warehouse
on the North Shore.

17:06.763 --> 17:07.896
I'll make some calls.

17:07.897 --> 17:09.031
We could coordinate
with law enforcement,

17:09.032 --> 17:10.199
get a TAC team in

17:10.201 --> 17:11.465
and do some recon.

17:11.468 --> 17:13.569
No, we need
to move on this now, Will.

17:13.570 --> 17:15.704
Get your law
enforcement in place,

17:15.705 --> 17:17.071
'cause I'm
gearing up now.

17:17.074 --> 17:18.107
You guys are free
to join me

17:18.108 --> 17:19.108
if you think
you can keep up.

17:27.553 --> 17:29.087
Are you sure you're
feeling all right?

17:29.089 --> 17:30.221
Are you kidding?

17:30.223 --> 17:31.423
I feel great,

17:31.425 --> 17:33.825
better than I have
in years.

17:33.827 --> 17:36.160
So, how did you
manage to--

17:36.162 --> 17:37.895
wow.

17:37.897 --> 17:40.564
Never underestimate the power
of a woman's determination.

17:40.566 --> 17:42.032
Well, the...

17:42.034 --> 17:44.068
The stunner beam must have
weakened the crystal matrix--

17:44.070 --> 17:45.168
Oh, right, right.

17:45.170 --> 17:46.469
It didn't have
anything to do

17:46.471 --> 17:49.005
with your fear of
losing me, or...

17:49.007 --> 17:50.673
Don't let it go to your head.

17:50.675 --> 17:51.908
Now, can we
get out of here, please?

17:51.910 --> 17:53.776
Allow me.

17:53.778 --> 17:57.547
Let's see...

17:57.549 --> 17:59.483
Well, the mortar
has been reinforced

17:59.485 --> 18:01.585
with a carbon compound.

18:01.587 --> 18:03.487
Hard as diamond.

18:03.489 --> 18:05.088
So you can't
break through it?

18:05.090 --> 18:07.891
Well, I'm not exactly
at full strength.

18:07.893 --> 18:10.160
I'm hungry enough
to drink cow's blood.

18:10.162 --> 18:11.961
Ah.

18:11.963 --> 18:13.963
I've got two packets of peanuts
and a protein bar.

18:13.965 --> 18:15.898
Ew, no.

18:15.900 --> 18:18.000
All right, stand back,
I'll see what I can do.

18:21.004 --> 18:23.739
[Straining with effort]

18:23.741 --> 18:24.973
Dammit.

18:24.975 --> 18:27.542
These walls are part of
the original Praxian fort.

18:27.544 --> 18:29.710
They were built to withstand
the strength of a vampire.

18:29.712 --> 18:32.546
So kind of you to say.

18:32.548 --> 18:36.117
Why would they build
a booby trap without failsafes?

18:36.119 --> 18:38.019
I mean, there has to be
some sort of control

18:38.021 --> 18:39.687
to override it.

18:39.689 --> 18:40.555
I found these markings,

18:40.557 --> 18:41.589
thought they might
be sensors,

18:41.591 --> 18:43.058
but nothing seems
to operate the door.

18:43.060 --> 18:44.193
Right.

18:44.195 --> 18:45.194
Well, maybe
they're burnt out.

18:45.196 --> 18:47.263
[Carapace crackling]

18:47.265 --> 18:49.899
[Crumbling and crackling]

18:49.901 --> 18:52.736
That's odd.

18:52.738 --> 18:54.237
The crystal's degrading.

18:54.239 --> 18:55.405
It must be a reaction

18:55.407 --> 18:57.207
to the piercing
of the outer layer.

19:00.177 --> 19:04.146
[Crackling]

19:04.148 --> 19:06.648
My God.

19:06.650 --> 19:08.216
She's alive.

19:13.787 --> 19:14.621
We have to get her
out of there.

19:14.623 --> 19:16.556
[Chuckles doubtfully]

19:16.558 --> 19:18.292
We're not equipped
to handle a living vampire.

19:18.294 --> 19:21.129
Excuse me, one of us
<i>is</i> a living vampire.

19:21.131 --> 19:24.966
Helen, come on,
this is our chance

19:24.968 --> 19:26.468
to come face to face

19:26.470 --> 19:28.470
with the last remnant
of an extinct civilization.

19:28.472 --> 19:29.839
I agree.

19:29.841 --> 19:31.407
I'm just saying we need to wait
until we can get

19:31.409 --> 19:32.542
a proper team down here.

19:32.544 --> 19:34.511
A proper team?
How long is that going to take?

19:34.513 --> 19:36.279
Come on, the crypt
is disintegrating

19:36.281 --> 19:38.014
on top of her.

19:38.016 --> 19:39.115
I'm sorry. Once it was opened
and the air got in,

19:39.117 --> 19:40.349
all bets were off.

19:40.351 --> 19:42.117
And I opened it, I get it,
thank you.

19:42.119 --> 19:43.452
I'm not blaming you,

19:43.454 --> 19:46.254
but, yes, you woke her up,
so now deal with it.

19:46.256 --> 19:47.321
Do you want her
to die in there?

19:47.323 --> 19:48.456
No, of course not.

19:48.458 --> 19:49.991
Good, because
I would hate to think

19:49.993 --> 19:51.292
that the only creature

19:51.294 --> 19:53.094
that's not worthy
of your protection

19:53.096 --> 19:54.696
is me and my--
my kin.

19:54.698 --> 19:56.030
I just...

19:59.202 --> 20:02.771
[Shattering]

20:02.773 --> 20:05.207
H-how did you
do that?

20:05.209 --> 20:08.144
I'm a vampire.

20:19.357 --> 20:20.624
Infrared imaging
shows a hot spot

20:20.626 --> 20:22.626
in the northwest corner.

20:22.628 --> 20:24.728
A lot of small bodies
packed in tight.

20:24.730 --> 20:26.463
The Taminsails.

20:26.465 --> 20:27.464
Now, we got a TAC team

20:27.466 --> 20:28.865
covering
the northwest exit.

20:28.867 --> 20:30.667
A couple guards
are coming and going,

20:30.669 --> 20:32.202
but no customer
traffic.

20:32.204 --> 20:34.338
They keep production
and sales separate

20:34.340 --> 20:35.739
so they don't draw the cops.

20:35.741 --> 20:37.541
These creatures have been
living in captivity,

20:37.543 --> 20:39.210
so they might be
a little aggressive

20:39.212 --> 20:40.311
when we try to move them.

20:40.313 --> 20:43.515
Suit up, let's go.

20:46.419 --> 20:48.521
There's no need
to be afraid.

20:48.523 --> 20:51.057
It's okay,
we want to help you.

20:51.059 --> 20:53.159
Come on.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.798
Do you think she
even understand us?

20:58.800 --> 21:00.300
[Whispering]:
I don't know.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.669
[Haltingly]
This is... from you.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.572
Your blood.

21:41.375 --> 21:42.643
Nikola.

21:42.645 --> 21:43.844
What did I tell you?

21:43.846 --> 21:46.613
The most brilliant,
elegant race

21:46.615 --> 21:47.814
in history.

21:47.816 --> 21:49.216
They solved the babel problem

21:49.218 --> 21:51.485
by embedding communications
in blood.

21:51.487 --> 21:55.323
[Magnus]:
It's remarkable.

21:55.325 --> 21:58.660
You've been asleep
for a very a long time.

21:58.662 --> 21:59.828
How are you feeling?

21:59.830 --> 22:03.465
I was in stasis, not asleep.

22:03.467 --> 22:04.834
No need to patronize me.

22:06.704 --> 22:07.737
Noted.

22:09.473 --> 22:11.308
[Tesla]:
Imagine a business card

22:11.310 --> 22:13.277
with a drop of blood
in the printing.

22:13.279 --> 22:14.879
You'd eliminate cultural
misunderstandings

22:14.881 --> 22:16.414
instantly.

22:16.416 --> 22:19.284
Global rule becomes
a legitimate possibility.

22:19.286 --> 22:20.752
Can we focus
for one minute?

22:20.754 --> 22:22.186
Yeah, right, sorry,
we'll talk about that later.

22:22.188 --> 22:23.855
I-I would love
to talk about that

22:23.857 --> 22:24.722
later...

22:26.726 --> 22:28.493
Where's my brother?

22:28.495 --> 22:30.229
Kalmin?

22:30.231 --> 22:31.363
There haven't been
vampires on Earth

22:31.365 --> 22:32.864
for a very long time.

22:32.866 --> 22:33.766
But I carry on

22:33.768 --> 22:35.234
that legacy.

22:35.236 --> 22:36.869
Dormant gene,

22:36.871 --> 22:39.338

to pure vampire blood.

22:39.340 --> 22:40.606
Helen, please.

22:40.608 --> 22:41.306
Why do you have to
make it sound

22:41.308 --> 22:42.641
so clinical?

22:42.643 --> 22:43.642
My true nature

22:43.644 --> 22:44.776
was re-awoken

22:44.778 --> 22:46.644
with these dormant genes,

22:46.646 --> 22:49.848
and, uh, my vision,
and, uh, my genius,

22:49.850 --> 22:51.849
all my gifts,

22:51.851 --> 22:53.952
from my ancestors,
from you,

practically wasted

22:54.821 --> 22:56.955
in this primitive
modern world.

22:56.957 --> 22:58.857
What about
the rest of my people?

22:58.859 --> 23:00.826
There's been
a shift in power.

23:02.362 --> 23:03.462
And our beautiful cities?

23:03.464 --> 23:05.632
All that we built?

23:05.634 --> 23:06.800
Yeah, it's...

23:06.802 --> 23:09.369
All a little different
than what you remember.

23:14.542 --> 23:15.542
Thank you.

23:20.882 --> 23:23.817
If we're the only two left, I'll
have to rely on you.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.820
It would be my honor.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.889
I have so much
to learn from you,

23:28.891 --> 23:31.658
and that's not something
I ever say.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.926
I can attest to that.

23:32.928 --> 23:33.927
Yeah.

23:35.296 --> 23:37.598
And what's your story?

23:37.600 --> 23:41.002
Are you of the kingdom?

23:41.004 --> 23:45.808
Well, it's a...

[Tesla]: So, you were
at war with the Praxians

25:27.976 --> 25:29.342
for centuries.

25:29.344 --> 25:30.676
They were terrified of us.

25:30.678 --> 25:33.012
Tried to destroy us
any way they could,

25:33.014 --> 25:36.148
and then they ran into the earth
like rats.

25:36.150 --> 25:37.516
We took over
all their old forts.

25:37.518 --> 25:39.885
But it says there
that you were dead.

25:39.887 --> 25:40.752
You were sent
to the afterlife,

25:40.754 --> 25:42.320
or "after-time".

25:42.322 --> 25:43.921
" <i>Kianaru</i> " isn't

It's the future.

25:45.992 --> 25:48.759
Right. Right, the future.

25:48.761 --> 25:49.993
How could I miss that?

25:49.995 --> 25:52.495
So, you were deliberately
put into stasis

25:52.497 --> 25:53.963

25:53.965 --> 25:55.798
When everyone

25:55.800 --> 25:57.634
it's hard to pass on the throne.

25:57.636 --> 26:00.036
My ancestors kept trying
to kill each other,

26:00.038 --> 26:02.038
so we had to come up
with a better way.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.406
You took turns ruling.

26:03.408 --> 26:05.575
Just so evolved.

26:05.577 --> 26:07.677
I left my brother,
Kalmin, in charge.

26:07.679 --> 26:08.978
He was supposed
to revive me.

26:08.980 --> 26:10.079
But that
never happened.

26:10.081 --> 26:12.114
No, I've heard of Kalmin.

26:12.116 --> 26:15.584
The legends say that he ruled
for a thousand years

26:15.586 --> 26:17.085
before he was assassinated
by his youngest son,

26:17.087 --> 26:19.454
which means that
he left you in there to rot

26:19.456 --> 26:21.923
while he kept your kingdom
for himself.

26:38.773 --> 26:42.108
how to reopen the door
that locked us in here?

26:42.110 --> 26:43.043
The security system
was designed

26:43.045 --> 26:45.746
to protect me
from my enemies.

26:45.748 --> 26:47.581
Anyone who broke in

How did you
set it off

Ah, well, that's a story
for another day.

The question is,

26:59.963 --> 27:01.162
how do we
get out of here now?

There's an escape hatch

27:02.765 --> 27:04.665
behind that wall.

27:04.667 --> 27:06.066
A human wouldn't be able
to shift the weight,

27:18.913 --> 27:20.779
It gives you
everything you need,

to the surface.

[Magnus]: There doesn't
have to be a war.

33:33.903 --> 33:35.536
We take you back
to the Sanctuary.

33:35.538 --> 33:37.538
You could learn from us,
see what we've become.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.173
And then what, we'll
share power equally?

33:39.175 --> 33:40.208
Please.

33:40.210 --> 33:41.676
You won't win.

33:41.678 --> 33:42.777
We have weapons

33:42.779 --> 33:43.745
that could devastate
the entire planet.

33:43.747 --> 33:44.879
Your loss.

33:44.881 --> 33:46.581
You'd have
nothing left to rule.

33:46.583 --> 33:48.016
Then we'll start over.

33:50.018 --> 33:53.888
You're so shocked.
It's lovely.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.327
You would really
destroy the world

33:59.329 --> 34:00.661
just so you could
conquer it?

34:00.663 --> 34:02.897
Why not, if it's
there for the taking?

34:02.899 --> 34:03.931
Oh, come on,

34:03.933 --> 34:05.600
you didn't think
you'd rule forever.

34:05.602 --> 34:06.634
For an inferior species,

34:06.636 --> 34:08.735
I'd say you had
a pretty good run.

34:08.737 --> 34:11.239
As did you, until
we defeated you.

34:11.241 --> 34:13.675
That won't happen again.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.510
We're going deeper.

34:15.512 --> 34:17.078
You spotted that,
did you?

34:17.080 --> 34:18.545
I thought we were
going to the surface.

34:18.547 --> 34:19.748
We will.

34:19.750 --> 34:20.882
We just have to
make a quick stop

34:20.884 --> 34:22.917
along the way.

34:22.918 --> 34:25.688
There's that
shocked look again.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.857
You know, I expected
more from you, Helen.

34:27.859 --> 34:29.225
You read the legend.

34:29.226 --> 34:31.726
"Afina laid to rest
to await <i> kianaru</i> ,

34:31.728 --> 34:33.929
the time of returning."

34:33.931 --> 34:35.965
But not just Afina.

34:35.967 --> 34:39.869
That's right.
Afina and her court.

34:41.004 --> 34:42.739
What is this place?

34:42.741 --> 34:44.574
[Pushing buttons]

34:44.576 --> 34:46.576
[Device warbling]

34:46.578 --> 34:48.110
[Stone grinds]

34:52.617 --> 34:54.819
My court.

34:54.821 --> 34:56.152
My warriors,

34:56.155 --> 34:57.922
and they'll be
very pleased

34:57.924 --> 35:00.925
with the blood donor
I've brought them.

35:11.079 --> 35:12.746
[Afina]: Not as crude
as the way you released me.

35:13.476 --> 35:15.842
Have I thanked you
for that, by the way?

35:15.844 --> 35:17.411
I could always
put you back in.

35:17.413 --> 35:19.679
It's too late for that,
I'm afraid.

35:19.681 --> 35:20.714
The first seeds

35:20.716 --> 35:23.349
of a new master race.

35:23.351 --> 35:25.418
You're lucky to be
witnessing it first hand--

35:35.461 --> 35:36.961
[groans, body thuds]

35:43.401 --> 35:46.070
You should not have done that.

35:54.947 --> 35:56.715
Son of a...

35:58.718 --> 36:00.519
Afina, come on!

36:00.521 --> 36:02.488
I thought we had something.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.457
Call it heat, attraction...

36:05.826 --> 36:09.662
You and me,
we were gonna...

36:09.664 --> 36:12.432
I hate her.

36:21.409 --> 36:25.078
[Metal rattling]

36:36.388 --> 36:38.389
Excellent.

36:40.993 --> 36:42.794
I would have shared
everything with you.

36:42.796 --> 36:44.796
All the wonders of a new age.

36:44.798 --> 36:46.632
While keeping me
as your personal canteen?

36:46.634 --> 36:49.402
In my time, it was an honor
to serve the Queen.

36:50.438 --> 36:51.438
I'll pass.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.106
Suit yourself.

36:55.811 --> 36:56.911
Hi.

36:56.913 --> 36:58.946
Hi.

36:58.948 --> 37:00.682
Nikola...

37:00.684 --> 37:02.083
You're out of
your depth, mongrel.

37:02.085 --> 37:03.384
I'd rather be a mongrel

37:03.386 --> 37:05.520
than a stuck-up
inbred bitch.

37:08.124 --> 37:10.559
Just keep her
under control.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.759
My pleasure.

37:11.761 --> 37:13.729
I need to try
and reverse the process

37:13.731 --> 37:15.731
before the others wake up.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.399
[Countdown ticking]

37:17.401 --> 37:19.568
[Snarling]

37:19.570 --> 37:20.736
[Snarls]

37:31.582 --> 37:33.783
[Magnus]: Nikola!

37:33.785 --> 37:34.818
I'm fine.

37:34.820 --> 37:35.752
[Snarling]

37:35.754 --> 37:38.021
[Tesla]: You worry
about that.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.989
[Countdown ticking]

37:42.092 --> 37:43.693
[Stone grinding]

37:43.695 --> 37:46.697
Wait, stop!
Don't kill him!

37:46.699 --> 37:47.831
I have a proposal.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.766
Now you want to negotiate?

37:49.768 --> 37:51.568
Make it fast.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.104
The Praxians, your enemies.

37:54.106 --> 37:55.705
They left you
the surface

37:55.707 --> 37:58.175
while they retreated into
the depths of Hollow Earth.

37:58.177 --> 37:59.176
Helen, no.

37:59.178 --> 38:00.911
They're still there.

38:00.913 --> 38:02.980
They have
a thriving city.

38:02.982 --> 38:04.782
More advanced than anything
you had in your kingdom.

38:04.784 --> 38:05.716
Don't do this.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.451
Quiet.

38:07.453 --> 38:08.786
Tell me more.

38:15.562 --> 38:19.532
Unbelievable.

38:19.534 --> 38:21.000
Leave the surface alone.

38:21.002 --> 38:22.735
You can have Hollow Earth.

38:22.737 --> 38:24.570
Take revenge
on your old enemies.

38:24.572 --> 38:26.505
That's my offer.

38:26.507 --> 38:27.606
Damn it, no--

38:27.608 --> 38:29.141
how do I find it?

38:29.143 --> 38:30.976
The second level activates
on a Praxian voice command.

38:30.978 --> 38:32.911
You tell us
how to leave...

38:34.147 --> 38:36.582
I'll tell you
how to talk to the map.

38:40.053 --> 38:41.653
Humans...

38:59.205 --> 39:03.508
I'll honor your deal,
but it won't last.

39:03.510 --> 39:04.842
Once we've conquered
the world down there,

39:04.844 --> 39:05.876
we'll be back.

39:05.878 --> 39:08.145
I don't doubt it.

39:08.147 --> 39:10.013
We'll be waiting.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.617
I would have so liked
to have had you for my court.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.986
In my chamber,

39:16.988 --> 39:18.554
there's a sensor at eye level
near the door.

39:18.556 --> 39:19.889
How do we activate it?

39:19.891 --> 39:22.625
Blood, of course.

39:25.496 --> 39:26.897
Now, the password.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.105
"Gateway."

39:37.142 --> 39:38.176
<i>Kha harag.</i>

39:39.611 --> 39:41.780
That should take you
where you need to go.

39:41.782 --> 39:44.515
[Scanner whirring]

39:51.889 --> 39:52.856
Which is it?

39:52.858 --> 39:53.857
Uh... here.

40:00.930 --> 40:01.830
[Stone grinding]

40:14.978 --> 40:18.981
[Power ramping]

40:18.983 --> 40:20.950
What?

40:20.952 --> 40:24.587
[Explosion rumbles]

40:48.145 --> 40:50.647
Got your email.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.983
You here to return
the deposit I left?

40:52.985 --> 40:54.984
Yeah, about that.

40:54.986 --> 40:58.654
I decided to use it
on a Tam farm of my own,

40:58.656 --> 41:01.757
kind of a country home
for the retired.

41:03.394 --> 41:04.928
It was you...

41:04.930 --> 41:07.129
Busted my North Shore op.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.232
If you can call it that.

41:09.234 --> 41:10.600
[Cocking gun]

41:10.602 --> 41:11.935
You know what, you're crazy,

41:11.937 --> 41:13.369
coming out here alone.

41:14.939 --> 41:16.639
I'm not alone.

41:18.108 --> 41:19.209
A year ago,

41:19.211 --> 41:20.210
you could've
pulled that trigger,

41:20.212 --> 41:22.145
and nobody would've cared,

41:22.147 --> 41:24.614
but I'm with the Sanctuary now.

41:24.616 --> 41:27.050
Think about
that combination,

41:27.052 --> 41:28.652
their toys,
my attitude?

41:28.654 --> 41:30.887
And you do not
want to piss us off

41:30.889 --> 41:33.423
any more than you already have.

41:33.425 --> 41:35.725
My advice?

41:35.727 --> 41:38.862
Cash in your chips
while you still can,

41:38.864 --> 41:40.864
'cause next time,

41:40.866 --> 41:43.267
you're not gonna know
what hit you.

41:44.702 --> 41:46.169
This is your only warning!

41:57.381 --> 41:58.814
Cut it a little closer
than I would have liked.

41:58.816 --> 41:59.982
What, me?

41:59.984 --> 42:02.117
It was you who
handed over the map.

42:02.119 --> 42:03.385
How did you know

42:03.387 --> 42:04.720
she was telling the truth
about the door?

42:04.722 --> 42:05.888
I didn't,

42:05.890 --> 42:07.323
but I had to stop her
either way.

42:07.325 --> 42:08.824
Well, thanks for
consulting me

42:08.826 --> 42:09.959
about the suicide pact.

42:09.961 --> 42:12.261
Sorry.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.529
It's a shame
we lost it, you know.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.698
We barely downloaded
a fraction of that database.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.200
Small price to pay.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.935
For my life?

42:18.937 --> 42:21.137
For saving the world
from human enslavement.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.372
Oh, right. That too.

42:24.242 --> 42:25.643
I'm sorry your glorious legacy

42:25.645 --> 42:27.078
didn't turn out to be
all you were hoping for.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.613
Please.

42:28.615 --> 42:32.184
She was an entitled bitch
with a Nazi complex.

42:32.186 --> 42:33.452
The world in <i> her</i> image?

42:33.454 --> 42:35.154
I don't think so.

42:35.156 --> 42:36.822
No, and we mustn't forget

42:36.824 --> 42:38.891
our most important
achievement of the day.

42:40.394 --> 42:41.962
My resurrection.

42:41.964 --> 42:43.330
Oh, here we go...

42:43.332 --> 42:47.467
Sweet,
sweet resurrection.
