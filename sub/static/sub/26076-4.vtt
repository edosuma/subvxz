WEBVTT

00:17.892 --> 00:20.020
[electricity buzzing]

00:33.950 --> 00:35.201
[Colleen on cell phone]<i> Danny?</i>

00:36.119 --> 00:38.747
<i>Danny? Hello?</i>

00:39.622 --> 00:42.500
<i>Danny, can you hear me? Danny!</i>

01:02.812 --> 01:04.814
[theme music playing]

02:19.389 --> 02:24.060
I keep going over and over it in my head,
but... it's still not clear.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.106
[Colleen sighs] Tell me again
what you saw.

02:28.731 --> 02:31.359
I told you. It was dark. I...

02:32.402 --> 02:33.653
I couldn't see.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.489
But you did see something, right?

02:36.573 --> 02:40.160
Colleen, I'm not making this up.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.288
No, I'm not doubting you.
I'm just trying to understand, okay?

02:43.371 --> 02:44.205
[Danny sighs]

02:44.289 --> 02:47.500
If it was a Golden Tiger ambush,
why even bother with the negotiation?

02:48.251 --> 02:49.335
And if it was the Hatchets,

02:49.419 --> 02:52.255
then why didn't they move in
when it all went sideways?

02:52.338 --> 02:53.882
It doesn't make sense.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.509
Mary. [sighs] This thing with Mary.
She's been watching us.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.429
I don't know who it was,
but it wasn't Mary.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.766
Yeah. [breathes deeply]

03:04.517 --> 03:06.144
I lost it back there, didn't I?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.938
I blew our shot at peace.

03:12.734 --> 03:13.651
[Colleen sighs]

03:15.904 --> 03:19.282
You are the only reason innocent lives
haven't been lost in this war.

03:20.950 --> 03:25.288
No one else is out there fighting
this fight. Not me, not the police.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.290
And it's worse now than it was before.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.959
You can't think of it like that.
You're trying your best, okay?

03:30.043 --> 03:32.128
But if this escalates any further...

03:33.338 --> 03:35.131
I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able
to rein it in.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.049
Okay.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.844
Last night was a mess,
but the Tigers still want the docks,

03:39.928 --> 03:42.180
and the Hatchets may still be willing
to make a deal.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.892
If there's a chance at peace,
it's gonna happen at the bargaining table.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.144
We sold Mrs. Yang on diplomacy once.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.647
There's no way
she's gonna listen to us again.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.190
This doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.485
[Danny sighs]

04:12.585 --> 04:15.338
I wish there was a world
where we were past all of this.

04:16.881 --> 04:19.509
Where dinner at the Silver Lotus
was just dinner.

04:21.135 --> 04:23.930
And people on the street
don't turn out to be surveilling us.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.725
We could track down Frank Choi,

04:28.393 --> 04:32.021
find out about the box,
the ledger, your family.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.608
My past will be right where I left it
when this is done.

04:37.402 --> 04:41.990
This is what's happening now,
so... we'll deal with it together.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.869
Diplomacy, then.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.290
We give it another shot.

04:52.875 --> 04:56.713
[Joy] <i>We can keep doing this,</i>
<i>but we keep circling the same paradox.</i>

04:57.630 --> 05:00.925
See, you're saying
you didn't give Danny the photos,

05:01.009 --> 05:04.178
but we saw them in his apartment.
And on the other hand, you're telling us

05:04.262 --> 05:06.306
it's just not something
that we need to worry about. Which is confusing, isn't it?

05:08.975 --> 05:10.893
Because either it didn't happen,

05:10.977 --> 05:13.396
or it's something
we shouldn't worry about.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.733
A paradox and a contradiction.

05:17.275 --> 05:21.154
I think you can understand
why this situation has us troubled.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.114
That's unfortunate.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.118
I don't have time for this.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.038
We need answers now.

05:31.956 --> 05:36.419
Lay a hand on me, lose that hand.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.214
Here's the thing, Walker.

05:41.257 --> 05:45.094
I've agreed to pay you
a very large sum of money.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.973
And after months of careful planning,
here we are.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.933
Today is the day.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.979
But I'm not paying a dime until you
tell me why you gave Danny the photos.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.189
I told you I didn't.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.066
Then who? Answer the question.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.490
I get it. You guys wanna know
the job's not blown,

06:05.573 --> 06:07.617
and I'm asking you to take it on faith.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.411
Faith is not a commodity
that I trade in anymore.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.414
And I'm not sitting here
with my hand on a Bible.

06:15.249 --> 06:18.795
I've spent the last 60 days
tracking Danny Rand.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.131
I know where he sleeps,

06:23.091 --> 06:24.550
how he eats,

06:25.635 --> 06:27.178
how he thinks

06:28.304 --> 06:29.972
and how he fights.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.810
And I also know that there are
not many people in this world

06:33.893 --> 06:37.688
who can handle that thing his fist does.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.327
I have a lot to prepare.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.623
The bowl, the Crane Sisters.

06:55.706 --> 06:56.791
You go.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.876
I got this handled.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.464
You know what she is capable of.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.137
If she wanted a fight,
you two would be fighting.

07:11.639 --> 07:15.268
She needs this job. I can get her to talk.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.525
We are so close to the end.

07:23.901 --> 07:27.488
So what are you asking for? Faith?

07:29.031 --> 07:30.116
Trust.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.499
[door opens] [door closes]

07:43.921 --> 07:46.883
[Bethany] You have your assistant
digging into your sister's business?

07:46.966 --> 07:48.468
She had me followed.

07:50.344 --> 07:54.474
I don't want to preach to you, Ward,
but you're stuck on a loop, man.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.143
I'm working on it.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.353
By skipping out on that dinner last night?

08:00.062 --> 08:01.522
[Ward] Here we go.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.066
Look...

08:05.026 --> 08:07.320
no lectures, okay. I get it.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.198
My first move
if I was in your shoes last night,

08:10.281 --> 08:12.200
back when I was off the rails using...

08:13.868 --> 08:14.869
[sighs]

08:15.828 --> 08:19.749
...taxi to this crappy sports bar
on 2nd Avenue

08:19.832 --> 08:22.335
and drink light beer
while I waited for my dealer.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.298
I don't picture you as a light-beer type.

08:27.882 --> 08:33.095
Picture you more of a...
uh, something with a twist.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.931
-[chuckles]
-[clears throat]

08:35.014 --> 08:36.265
You're deflecting.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.267
[breathes deeply]

08:39.644 --> 08:41.103
I set the whole damn thing up

08:41.187 --> 08:44.565
so that I could sit across the table
from her face-to-face.

08:45.149 --> 08:48.903
Then I couldn't... face her.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.780
You will next time.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.825
-The question is, how?
-Hmm.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.372
How do you best open a door
that's been closed?

09:00.498 --> 09:01.874
What's your instinct?

09:05.044 --> 09:06.003
Hmm.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.129
[chuckles]

09:08.965 --> 09:11.175
Why don't you channel your best self?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.095
Not the self you actually are.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.976
You're suggesting I do something kind?

09:21.519 --> 09:23.354
I didn't suggest anything.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.147
[chuckles]

09:26.732 --> 09:31.571
Let me ask you something.
Does NA do some kind of awards?

09:31.654 --> 09:35.992
Because I'm gonna, you know...
[clicks tongue] put your name in the hat.

09:36.075 --> 09:39.287
[chuckles] Yeah. I don't think
they do that.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.371
[Ward] Mmm.

09:43.958 --> 09:44.917
Um...

09:46.377 --> 09:52.341
I'm gonna call Carlos and...
see if he'll take over as your sponsor.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.802
You're dumping me?

09:55.595 --> 10:00.600
You're in my home. You're in my bed.
This is not how it's supposed to go.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.143
I like how it's going.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.229
I do, too.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.732
That's the point.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.904
-So, if I'm not your sponsee...
-Mmm-hmm.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.490
...then what am I?

10:17.033 --> 10:17.908
[Bethany] Well...

10:18.993 --> 10:21.078
I guess we'll find out.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.001
[footsteps approaching]

10:33.924 --> 10:36.010
Mrs. Yang will see you. This way.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.180
Wow.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.515
I can see where the money went.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.602
Yeah. Dirty money can sure look pretty.

10:55.905 --> 10:56.989
Wait here.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.913
[Danny whistles] Wow.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.791
[heart monitor beeping]

11:12.713 --> 11:14.465
[Liu] You got some balls showing up here.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.970
So this is the face behind the mask, huh?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.182
-The protector of Chinatown.
-[Danny] I'm sorry,

11:23.265 --> 11:24.725
but I didn't catch your name.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.436
This isn't a friendly introduction,
you clown.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.230
-[Danny] Clown?
-[scoffs]

11:29.313 --> 11:33.109
Wow. We've got a live one, huh?

11:33.192 --> 11:35.444
-We're here to see Mrs. Yang.
-[Liu] Leave...

11:38.906 --> 11:39.990
or we'll make you.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.326
You don't wanna do this.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.997
So, so badly, I do.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.127
Liu, stand down.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.213
They would not be here
without my permission.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.217
Your men have other matters to attend to.

12:15.401 --> 12:20.114
I'm surprised you called.
Our temporary alliance has run its course.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.908
Last night was a mess.
We owe you an explanation.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.578
I only had your safety in mind.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.706
I didn't mean to blow the negotiation.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.041
Your intentions don't change the facts.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.501
After last night's debacle,

12:32.585 --> 12:35.004
the war between Hatchet and Tiger
will only intensify.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.757
Unless you go back with another offer,
a sweeter one--

12:37.840 --> 12:39.300
There will be no more offers!

12:39.383 --> 12:41.719
And we won't allow
a full-blown war to erupt.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.346
Do not speak in absolutes to me,
young man.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.265
What he means to say is just that...

12:47.099 --> 12:49.685
we hope there is a way
to restart the negotiation.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.563
The docks are no longer in play.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.233
The Golden Tigers seized them.

12:59.361 --> 13:03.532
We were willing to concede the docks
when there was a reasonable exchange.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.369
But letting them take control?
We can't allow it.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.664
-There has to be another option.
-[Sherry] There is no other option.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.876
War is the language our two Triads
have spoken for centuries.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.379
I know you don't believe that.
Who is this coming from? Your husband?

13:17.963 --> 13:21.217
I speak for him... in his absence.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.679
He's not in Hong Kong, is he?

13:29.892 --> 13:30.893
No.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.939
He suffered a stroke.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.859
He's been in and out of consciousness,
unable to speak.

13:39.652 --> 13:44.365
The prognosis is... not positive.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.576
-I'm so sorry.
-When did this happen?

13:48.202 --> 13:51.580
-A few days ago.
-That's why you were at the parley?

13:52.289 --> 13:54.458
His condition would be seen as weakness.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.502
Your husband had a stroke

13:56.585 --> 13:59.004
as he was setting up peace talks
with the Tigers.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.841
-That can't be a coincidence--
-Danny, will you just...

14:02.800 --> 14:04.093
give us a minute, okay?

14:13.227 --> 14:16.647
Me and your husband, we...
we don't see eye-to-eye, but...

14:18.065 --> 14:20.067
we have a mutual respect for each other.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.532
I'm sorry.

14:27.867 --> 14:33.289
He blames himself for last night, and...
it makes him headstrong.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.540
[Sherry] Most men are.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.209
First, they're afraid...

14:37.918 --> 14:40.921
then they're furious at themselves
for this fear.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.214
[heart monitor beeping]

14:42.298 --> 14:44.800
I see it in the eyes of my husband's men.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.846
Impotence disguised as confidence.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.556
[chuckles softly]

14:50.639 --> 14:55.227
They're so afraid,
they wanna burn this city down.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.148
But you don't want that.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.441
[beeping continues]

15:01.150 --> 15:03.110
[Sherry] What I want is irrelevant.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.989
No. I don't believe that. Not at all.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.328
I don't have to tell you the cost of war,
okay?<i> </i>You know it.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.706
This town has been through this cycle
way too many times already.

15:15.789 --> 15:18.834
Lost face leads to violence,
violence leads to more violence.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.920
[beeping]

15:21.003 --> 15:25.382
But the way I see it,
we have two possible futures right now.

15:25.466 --> 15:29.219
And one ends in a funeral procession
all the way down Mott Street.

15:31.388 --> 15:35.142
[stammers] You say that war is all
this gang has known for centuries, but...

15:36.518 --> 15:38.854
history doesn't decide what happens next.

15:40.981 --> 15:41.982
You do.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.402
Your men will die for you, Mrs. Yang,

15:46.278 --> 15:48.280
or you can let 'em live.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.967
Mr. Yang, can you hear me?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.596
Someone do this to you? Was his name Davos?

16:19.728 --> 16:22.272
Why? Why would he do this?

16:22.356 --> 16:25.109
[shuddering breath]

16:26.318 --> 16:28.445
[softly] Hancock...

16:29.238 --> 16:33.117
two... one... two.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.411
[stammering] What? I...

16:35.494 --> 16:36.704
I can't understand.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.624
Hancock...

16:41.166 --> 16:46.171
two... one... two.

16:46.255 --> 16:50.718
-"Hancock 212." What does that mean?
-[beeping accelerates]

16:50.801 --> 16:52.469
[Yang breathing heavily]

16:52.553 --> 16:54.972
[heart monitor beeps rapidly]

16:55.055 --> 16:58.726
Easy. Hey, stay calm, all right?

16:58.809 --> 17:00.185
-[door opens]
-Slow your breathing.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.479
-What are you doing? Hey!
-Slow your breathing.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.607
Hai-Qing? What's happening?
What did you do to my husband?

17:05.691 --> 17:07.317
-I didn't do anything.
-What happened?

17:07.401 --> 17:09.611
Mrs. Yang, "Hancock 212."
What does he mean?

17:09.695 --> 17:11.947
-I want them out of my home!
-Your husband spoke to me now.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.825
-What exactly does he mean?
-You heard her. She wants you gone.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.744
Danny, let's go.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.538
This wasn't an accident.
I know the man who did this.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.668
Danny, what the hell?

17:24.752 --> 17:28.380
The bruises on Yang's neck, throat
and shoulder. It was Davos.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.759
What do you mean, it was Davos?
Will you slow down and explain this to me.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.761
It's an ancient technique
they taught in K'un-Lun.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.304
It's called the Devil's Claw.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.265
It strikes the pressure points,
carotid and subclavian arteries.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.100
It can cause a stroke?
Is that even possible?

17:40.184 --> 17:41.727
It's an extremely difficult technique.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.980
With K'un-Lun gone, there's only
two people who could have attempted it.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.065
Holy shit.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.693
Last night, in the alley,
could that have been Davos too?

17:49.777 --> 17:52.071
It might have been.
But if it was, he wasn't alone.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.198
How is he even connected to any of this?

17:54.281 --> 17:55.324
[Misty] Hey!

17:59.578 --> 18:01.830
You two just gonna walk right by me, huh?

18:03.207 --> 18:04.875
-Misty?
-[chuckles]

18:05.584 --> 18:07.002
What are you doing here?

18:07.086 --> 18:11.048
Well, if you'd check your phone,
you'd know. I'm looking for you two.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.009
[sighs] It's great to see you
and everything,

18:14.093 --> 18:16.386
but we're kind of in the middle
of something right now.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.722
Actually, I'd say
you're up to your necks in it.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.142
Come on, get in. We gotta talk.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.983
It wasn't a request.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.283
[sighs]

18:41.120 --> 18:45.207
Oh, uh, sorry about the mess.
We had to rush out last night.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.544
-Can I get you a drink or something?
-Sure. You got coffee?

18:48.627 --> 18:52.214
Um, I'm afraid
we're more of a tea household.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.632
Nah, I'm good.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.218
I haven't been here
since you took the tatami mats out.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.636
It came together nice.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.556
-[Colleen] Hmm.
-Should've got you a housewarming gift.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.600
A bottle of scotch,
or some refrigerator magnets.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.520
All right, so come on, Misty.
What's this all about?

19:08.313 --> 19:12.442
A couple years back, the police department
put together a task force

19:12.526 --> 19:15.070
aimed at taking down the Triads.

19:15.154 --> 19:19.825
Now, it was slow going
until they got a guy on the inside.

19:19.908 --> 19:24.204
Donnie Chang. Good cop. Good friend.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.416
He was one of the first to the hospital
when I lost my arm.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.168
[Danny] And let me guess.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.211
Now he's undercover
with one of the Triads.

19:31.295 --> 19:34.006
[Misty] Golden Tigers. He got in deep.

19:34.089 --> 19:37.259
-All the way up to Mr. Ho's right hand.
-He was there last night?

19:37.342 --> 19:41.430
And now he is in Brooklyn Methodist
with six broken bones.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.974
Now, when I went and saw him this morning,

19:44.057 --> 19:49.271
he said that some guy with a glowing fist
showed up on the scene.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.148
[Colleen] It wasn't Danny's fault, okay?

19:51.231 --> 19:54.359
He was trying to get Mrs. Yang out
and then everything went to shit.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.278
[Misty] And how exactly did that happen?

19:56.737 --> 19:59.406
I thought I saw someone outside
at the parley. I...

19:59.990 --> 20:01.450
I assumed it was another faction.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.911
The other faction you saw were cops.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.622
Probably a follow team
looking to get it all on camera.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.582
And if we hadn't pulled the plug, then...

20:08.665 --> 20:13.253
Then the leadership from the Triads
would most likely be in cuffs right now.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.632
And, look, I have no doubt
that you two had the best of intentions

20:16.715 --> 20:20.260
when you went into this, but I'm gonna
need for you to take a step back.

20:20.344 --> 20:24.806
If this was just about the Hatchets
and the Tigers, then fine, I get it.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.392
But there's something bigger going on.

20:27.851 --> 20:31.521
Ever since Davos got back, he's...
he's been off his center.

20:31.605 --> 20:34.566
We need to figure out how
and why he's tied up in this.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.109
[Misty] Sorry, who's Davos?

20:36.193 --> 20:39.112
-He's my brother, from K'un-Lun.
-Huh.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.530
The place where the...

20:40.614 --> 20:43.075
The dragons and the Thunderer, yeah.

20:43.158 --> 20:48.080
We think Davos gave Yang a stroke.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.625
Apparently, he knows a move.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.961
Okay.

20:54.044 --> 20:58.173
Why would Davos want to hurt Yang
or Yang's business?

20:58.257 --> 21:01.468
We don't know. We were trying to figure
that out when you picked us up.

21:01.551 --> 21:05.305
Yang said something to me. "Hancock 212."

21:06.765 --> 21:08.392
Hancock Transport.

21:08.475 --> 21:11.270
It's one of the largest maritime
shipping companies in the world.

21:11.353 --> 21:15.607
"Two-one-two" could be a ship,
or it could be a unit number.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.986
Maybe Davos had a deal with Yang.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.655
Something coming in off the water.

21:21.738 --> 21:24.491
The parley. If the Hatchets
didn't have control of the docks,

21:24.574 --> 21:26.285
then Mr. Yang would have
canceled shipments.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.078
Davos wouldn't want that, so...

21:29.496 --> 21:30.747
Oh, my God.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.877
-I've gotta get to the docks.
-Danny, come on.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.964
Look, the Triads are off your beat.

21:39.047 --> 21:42.509
And if your brother, Davos, is involved,
so is he. Davos is dangerous.
I can't just sit here and do nothing--

21:46.138 --> 21:47.764
She's right, Danny.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.936
NYPD has resources.
We don't even know what we're looking for.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.813
He may have taken Yang's life.

21:54.896 --> 21:59.818
Look, Danny... you and I
don't know each other very well.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.864
Now, you did something for me
that turned things around,

22:03.947 --> 22:05.699
and I appreciate that.

22:05.782 --> 22:09.286
I'm happy for you and Colleen.
I think you got a good thing going here.

22:09.369 --> 22:13.415
But I am telling you,
and I need you to hear me,

22:14.082 --> 22:15.334
you are off this.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.128
You understand?

22:19.504 --> 22:23.258
[sighs] Okay. All right, fine.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.594
Just, um...

22:27.387 --> 22:29.056
Just give me a minute, okay?

22:30.724 --> 22:32.225
I need to get some headspace.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.604
Absolutely.
Then you can catch me up on everything.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.691
I'm just trying to help, Danny.

22:49.451 --> 22:50.911
[sighs]

23:16.561 --> 23:17.437
[Joy] Mmm!

23:22.567 --> 23:23.652
This yours?

23:24.986 --> 23:26.863
Really didn't take you for the type.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.991
It isn't mine.

23:30.075 --> 23:34.663
Well, whoever drew this... definitely has
a thing for you. [chuckles]

23:36.832 --> 23:37.958
It's nice.

23:41.795 --> 23:45.340
My brother was a halfway-decent artist
when he was younger.

23:46.049 --> 23:48.468
Our father told him drawing pictures
was a waste of time, and then that was pretty much it.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.473
So your dad's an asshole.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.143
Brother is a pussy.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.812
[chuckles] That's actually
not a bad assessment.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.357
That's what I get paid for.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.448
[Joy] I used to get tied up in knots
about my brother.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.741
I mean, I'd know he was lying,

24:11.825 --> 24:15.704
or at least he was hopped up
on some opioid cocktail.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.331
I'd just look the other way.

24:18.957 --> 24:22.752
I guess I always figured that...
being there for him

24:22.836 --> 24:27.841
was better than...
not being there for him.

24:27.924 --> 24:30.427
I need you to stop touching my things.

24:30.510 --> 24:34.848
See, the thing is, I wasn't helping him.
I was his crutch.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.351
And I definitely wasn't helping myself.

24:40.228 --> 24:44.983
What I didn't realize was...
you have to take care of yourself.

24:46.026 --> 24:50.071
It's the only thing that you can do.
Do you know what I mean?

24:51.656 --> 24:54.409
No matter how much you love someone,
no matter how much wanna help,

24:54.493 --> 24:57.704
you can't let them control you.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.124
Is this real?

25:06.630 --> 25:08.507
You have multiple personalities?

25:11.259 --> 25:16.348
It's "dissociative identity disorder."

25:18.767 --> 25:20.143
Right. I...

25:21.311 --> 25:22.521
That's what I meant.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.980
Um...

25:24.064 --> 25:29.945
"Worsening episodes of dissociation,
apparent development of alters..."

25:30.654 --> 25:34.866
-How many of these things--
-I need you to stop touching my stuff.

25:37.077 --> 25:37.953
[chuckles nervously]

25:38.036 --> 25:44.125
So, when you said you were hanging up
the vigilante stuff, you meant literally?

25:45.001 --> 25:47.837
-You always did say my katana was weird.
-It is.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.339
[Colleen chuckles]

25:49.422 --> 25:53.343
But sometimes,
a little weird can go a long way.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.011
[Colleen] Hmm.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.974
This about what went down
in Midland Circle?

26:02.686 --> 26:03.728
You know, in Bushido,

26:03.812 --> 26:06.898
you're not meant to draw your blade
unless you intend to use it?

26:09.192 --> 26:11.069
If I carry that around, I'll use it.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.907
I just can't do that anymore.

26:22.747 --> 26:27.002
Telephoto lens. Obscured foreground.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.797
This is probably not
next year's Christmas card.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.133
Someone's following us.

26:35.051 --> 26:40.181
So for someone who is trying
to stay out of the fray...

26:40.265 --> 26:43.518
-Oh, okay, I have been trying.
-Mmm.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.606
I got a job at a community center.
I've been keeping my head down.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.817
Danny asked me to come out with him
a couple of times. I said no. I...

26:52.277 --> 26:53.695
But then... [sighs]

26:56.656 --> 26:57.657
this.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.995
I found something from my past,
and I was digging into it.

27:02.537 --> 27:03.830
My path crossed his.

27:03.913 --> 27:06.041
I know what it's like
to get pulled into something,

27:06.124 --> 27:08.918
so I'm not gonna pretend
like I haven't been there, but...

27:09.002 --> 27:13.882
drawing a line in the sand
only works if you don't cross it.

27:15.008 --> 27:20.472
Yeah, I know. I know. But I can't ignore
what's happening in my neighborhood.

27:21.765 --> 27:22.974
Neither can he.

27:24.601 --> 27:28.104
Speaking of...
how long is your boy gonna be out there?

27:32.942 --> 27:33.943
Danny?

27:36.905 --> 27:37.989
Oh, shit.

27:38.907 --> 27:41.409
-This was never part of the deal.
-You should have listened to me.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.745
-You should have said something.
-Stop talking.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.997
I need to understand how you--

27:46.081 --> 27:48.500
-You can't understand.
-[grunts] Stop.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.794
Know what it's like to wake up
and not know where you are

27:50.877 --> 27:52.671
or where you've been
or what you said to whom?

27:52.754 --> 27:54.506
Do you know what it's like
to wake up hungry

27:54.589 --> 27:56.549
because some other part of you
didn't bother to eat

27:56.633 --> 27:58.885
because she wanted to paint
pretty pictures instead?

27:58.968 --> 27:59.844
[gasping]

27:59.928 --> 28:03.431
Or what it's like to worry that
all your plans will be turned upside down

28:03.515 --> 28:05.642
because some asinine part of you

28:05.725 --> 28:08.478
is fighting for some pipe dream
that she's never...

28:08.561 --> 28:10.313
[gasping]

28:13.775 --> 28:14.818
"She."

28:14.901 --> 28:17.570
[breathing heavily] Ooh.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.698
Listen to me. [panting]

28:19.781 --> 28:21.324
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.912
Your pity I do not want.

28:26.621 --> 28:31.418
Because you know these things about me
does not mean you know me.

28:31.501 --> 28:34.629
No, I don't. [panting]

28:34.713 --> 28:38.007
I don't know you,
and I didn't mean to offend you.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.895
You didn't give Danny the photos.

28:53.022 --> 28:54.107
But you did.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.819
And Danny's met you...

28:59.904 --> 29:03.116
but he hasn't met... you.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.244
In a manner of speaking.

29:07.871 --> 29:11.791
-I have so many questions.
-Do not ask them.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.387
[softly] I need the job.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.734
Can you manage your condition?

29:38.568 --> 29:39.986
I usually do.

29:43.823 --> 29:46.159
Can you manage it today?

29:46.242 --> 29:47.243
Yes.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.370
Probably.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.457
I can take the necessary precautions.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.085
I need you to look me in the eye...

29:58.004 --> 30:00.381
and tell me that you can pull this off.

30:02.217 --> 30:05.678
If you can do that, then I will leave.

30:06.930 --> 30:11.392
And I will take it on faith.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.647
[softly] I can do it.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.945
Good. Then get to work.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.498
[door opens] [door closes]

31:16.499 --> 31:18.710
[grunting and straining]

31:22.297 --> 31:23.381
[grunts]

31:46.446 --> 31:49.657
[men conversing in Mandarin]

31:52.410 --> 31:54.996
-[breathing heavily]
-[indistinct chatter continues]

32:23.066 --> 32:24.984
Hey! You can't be here. I've come for what is mine.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.448
Everything in here
belongs to the Golden Tigers.

32:31.115 --> 32:31.950
[grunts]

33:38.224 --> 33:39.308
[exhales deeply]

35:01.641 --> 35:02.809
Davos!

35:16.948 --> 35:18.199
What the hell?

35:35.800 --> 35:36.884
[Colleen] Danny?

35:42.765 --> 35:45.101
-[footsteps approaching]
-Shh... Stop.

35:47.478 --> 35:48.563
[Colleen] Danny!

35:50.064 --> 35:52.233
Hey! Easy! Easy.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.236
-What happened?
-They were dead when I got here.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.780
-Is there anybody else?
-I don't know. Check.

35:59.615 --> 36:00.825
Shit.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.833
[Misty] What the hell were you thinking
coming down here by yourself?

36:08.916 --> 36:09.917
Look, I told you,

36:10.001 --> 36:12.587
if my brother's involved,
I'm not gonna sit this out.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.506
-And I told you, you should!
-You should have talked to us.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.050
I tried. You wouldn't listen to me.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.178
I found Davos's shipment.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.889
It's a coffin
with a very old dead body in it.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.932
Someone's cut a piece out of it.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.476
Why is it that every time
I'm with you two,

36:27.560 --> 36:29.061
some weird shit happens?

36:29.145 --> 36:31.898
Believe me, this is just as strange for me
as it is for you.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.274
What could he want with a corpse?

36:33.357 --> 36:36.485
I don't know.
We gotta track him down and find out.

36:36.569 --> 36:41.574
Hey, wait a minute. Hey!
Look, this is an active crime scene.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.576
You can't just walk out of here.

36:43.659 --> 36:44.577
Try me.

36:45.494 --> 36:48.539
Danny, look...

36:50.208 --> 36:52.210
I'm trying to be your friend here.

36:52.752 --> 36:56.255
But you are making this
extremely difficult.

36:56.339 --> 37:00.760
Well, if you wanna help, help.
Otherwise, get out of my way.

37:00.843 --> 37:02.762
-Hey, hey, hey. Okay. Okay.
-Excuse me?

37:02.845 --> 37:03.804
Okay, step back.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.431
You need to listen to her.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.807
He is not entirely wrong, okay?

37:06.891 --> 37:10.519
If this was Davos, then maybe--
maybe Danny could have... stopped him.

37:11.145 --> 37:12.605
If he was here earlier.

37:12.688 --> 37:13.856
Misty, please.

37:28.704 --> 37:32.375
Misty's just doing her job. I get it.
But she doesn't understand--

37:32.458 --> 37:34.168
I don't understand, Danny.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.754
You're carrying a lot.
More than you should have to.

37:36.837 --> 37:39.590
But you keep running headfirst
without even stopping to think.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.426
When I stop, people die.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.929
And last night,
you put a police officer in the hospital.

37:45.805 --> 37:48.474
I thought you of all people
would understand.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.436
When someone you care about,
you've known your whole life,

37:52.520 --> 37:55.106
turns out to be capable
of something like this...

38:02.154 --> 38:03.155
Go.

40:04.318 --> 40:05.403
Hey, sis.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.036
What are you doin' here, Ward?

40:14.120 --> 40:17.581
It's cold outside,
so I bribed the super to let me up.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.876
You need a new super.

40:25.047 --> 40:26.674
Are you gonna invite me in?

40:29.260 --> 40:31.178
That's the way it works
with vampires, right?

40:45.901 --> 40:46.861
Wow.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.197
Pictures on the wall.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.701
Flowers in the vase.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.036
Starting to look lived-in.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.874
That's because I live here.
What do you want, Ward?

41:01.542 --> 41:02.668
[Ward clears throat]

41:04.879 --> 41:07.673
I know you're doing business
with Sofia Rios.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.676
Organic photovoltaics.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.972
Earlier this afternoon, I reached out
to a small company in Jersey.

41:15.055 --> 41:16.015
[Joy] Hmm.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.522
What did you do, Ward?

41:24.356 --> 41:29.111
I made them an offer that they rightly saw
as too good to pass up.

41:30.029 --> 41:33.782
-Son of a bitch.
-I'm not blocking you.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.576
I'm doing you a favor.

41:35.659 --> 41:39.205
Otherwise, you would have to dump
a ton of capital into this.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.291
This way, you get your business
off the ground without falling into debt.

41:42.374 --> 41:45.544
That's exactly the kind of shit
Dad would pull. Well done.

41:45.628 --> 41:48.547
Don't do that. This is a win-win.

41:48.631 --> 41:51.842
You... trying to strong-arm me
back to Rand?

41:51.926 --> 41:55.721
Oh, the opposite.
You want independence. I hear that.

41:55.804 --> 41:58.390
No strings. No Rand.

41:58.474 --> 42:01.602
It's yours. It's a gift.

42:03.437 --> 42:07.566
And... you wouldn't be involved at all?

42:09.527 --> 42:10.444
[scoffs]

42:12.279 --> 42:15.449
Think of me like a...
like a silent partner.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.450
-[scoffs]
-A resource.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.494
Joy, imagine what
we could accomplish together.

42:18.577 --> 42:21.872
I don't know how to make this
any clearer for you, Ward.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.626
I don't want you involved.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.296
Wow.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.428
This is supposed to be an olive branch.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.473
A peace offering.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.643
Whose peace? I mean, this...

42:43.644 --> 42:46.855
this need for codependency is pathetic.

42:47.856 --> 42:49.441
What are you doing?

42:49.984 --> 42:54.071
I mean, isn't it about time you stop
making me a surrogate for Mom?

42:54.530 --> 42:56.198
Jesus, Joy.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.038
That was cruel.

43:10.713 --> 43:14.508
I am never coming back to Rand...

43:17.720 --> 43:19.013
or you.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.852
I'm making my own way.

43:27.479 --> 43:29.106
You really ought to do the same.

43:31.108 --> 43:34.445
-I bought you a company.
-I hope you kept the receipt.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.614
Good night, Ward.

43:50.127 --> 43:52.671
[door opens and closes]

44:00.429 --> 44:02.848
-[breathes shakily]
-[cell phone vibrates]

44:04.350 --> 44:06.101
[scoffing]

44:18.489 --> 44:20.366
Joy, it's Danny.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.661
You gotta get as far away
from Davos as you can.

44:23.744 --> 44:25.704
Believe me when I say this.
He's dangerous.

44:25.788 --> 44:27.998
Meet me at the dojo.
I'll explain everything.

44:29.833 --> 44:33.045
[announcer on PA] <i>This is</i>
<i>a Brooklyn-bound C local train.</i>

44:45.224 --> 44:46.058
[grunts]

44:46.141 --> 44:48.894
Hey! Mary? What are you doing?

44:57.152 --> 44:58.821
Wait. Hold on!

45:10.874 --> 45:11.792
[panting]

45:13.961 --> 45:16.422
[yelling]

45:20.175 --> 45:22.386
Mary, stop!

45:22.928 --> 45:26.181
Look, whatever this is about,
let's just talk about it, okay?

45:26.265 --> 45:27.433
[chuckles]

45:39.486 --> 45:40.529
I don't want to hurt you.

45:47.286 --> 45:48.287
Back off! [cell phone ringing]

46:11.393 --> 46:12.394
Colleen?

46:12.978 --> 46:15.063
It's Mary. She's--

46:55.979 --> 46:57.439
[Colleen on cell phone] <i>Danny?</i>

46:58.106 --> 47:00.734
<i>Danny? Hello?</i>

47:01.693 --> 47:04.571
<i>Danny, can you hear me? Danny!</i>

48:35.704 --> 48:36.538
[Danny grunts]

48:37.080 --> 48:39.207
[yelling]

50:31.361 --> 50:34.281
Now you'll give me
what has always been mine, brother.
