<i>¡Apúrense, cabrones! ¡Rápido!</i>

04:37.672 --> 04:41.171
<i>¡Pásale! ¡Pásale! ¡Échale!</i>

05:32.852 --> 05:35.474
<i>¡Órale! ¡Échale! ¡Échale!</i>

05:56.209 --> 05:58.499
<i>¡Órale, muchachos!</i>

06:21.360 --> 06:23.519
<i>Apúrense, muchachos.</i>

06:24.614 --> 06:27.400
This is Deputy Sheriff Oscar Garcia.

06:27.533 --> 06:30.783
You are all under arrest
for horse stealing. Drop your guns.

06:30.911 --> 06:34.246
<i>¡Échale con tu chingada madre, cabrón!</i>

07:21.046 --> 07:24.296
You gonna steal these horses
back from me? Huh? Policeman?

07:24.424 --> 07:27.425
These are my horses!

07:27.553 --> 07:31.681
Garcia, Ramos, policemen...

07:31.807 --> 07:33.217
<i>¡Órale!</i>

07:33.350 --> 07:37.977
You'll never get away with this. You can't
kill a policeman. They'll hunt you down.

07:38.105 --> 07:40.431
<i>¡Hijo de perra!</i>

07:40.567 --> 07:43.651
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

07:46.489 --> 07:49.360
I'm gonna teach him a lesson.

07:52.745 --> 07:56.659
Some of these guys
are a lot taller than me.

08:01.755 --> 08:04.376
A whole head taller.

08:07.135 --> 08:09.708
<i>¡Pues de la chingada!
¿ Qué está pasando?</i>

08:12.015 --> 08:16.926
<i>Hey, you, cabrón! You're hurting my cars,
pendejo! Why you do that?</i>

08:17.062 --> 08:20.431
This is JJ McQuade, Texas Ranger.

08:21.107 --> 08:22.566
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:22.692 --> 08:24.935
Put 'em down.

08:26.237 --> 08:30.105
<i>- Do not move.
- "Do not move."</i>

08:31.827 --> 08:35.953
Hey, you. Stand up like a man
so I can see you.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.012
<i>¡Puta!</i>

08:57.143 --> 08:59.385
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

09:01.232 --> 09:04.232
<i>There! You think I care
about your pinche friend now?</i>

09:04.360 --> 09:07.277
Put down your weapon
or I'll shoot this man!

09:07.404 --> 09:10.571
I say I'll shoot this man, motherfucker!

09:12.034 --> 09:15.368
<i>Better listen to me, cabrón!</i>

09:15.496 --> 09:18.414
Right now! Come down!

09:18.541 --> 09:22.705
<i>Ranger! I'm gonna kill this man!
Drop your weapon! ¿ Qué quieres?</i>

09:22.837 --> 09:26.786
Ain't no one ever killed no Texas Ranger
and lived to tell it.

09:26.924 --> 09:33.462
<i>He ain't that big. Muchachos, come down.
Show our honoured guest some respect.</i>

09:55.787 --> 09:57.661
<i>¡Echa, hijo puta!</i>

10:21.230 --> 10:25.773
I've never seen
a Texas Ranger up close before.

10:25.901 --> 10:27.562
You know,

10:27.695 --> 10:31.942
once a Texas Ranger
kicked my father's teeth out.

10:32.074 --> 10:34.944
Would you do that to me, Texas Ranger?

11:04.023 --> 11:06.395
Don't shoot me.

11:11.531 --> 11:16.323
Don't shoot me! You already kicked
my teeth out! What else do you want?

11:16.453 --> 11:19.619
Like father, like son.

11:19.748 --> 11:21.622
Come on.

11:24.837 --> 11:28.881
Get back, kid.
Stay there and I'll cut you loose.

11:29.007 --> 11:33.171
I just wanna say thank you.
Thank you. You were great.

11:33.304 --> 11:37.965
OK, OK, kid. OK.
Go cut your buddies loose. Go on.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.886
<i>Chinga a tu madre, puto.</i>

11:41.019 --> 11:43.557
Come on. I'm gonna fix your teeth.

12:08.255 --> 12:13.214
<i>We present to you, Dakota Brown...</i>

12:20.310 --> 12:25.350
<i>for 38 years of unrivalled performance
as a Texas Ranger...</i>

12:29.694 --> 12:32.565
for over 2,000 felony arrests...

12:40.497 --> 12:46.084
<i>for serving the great state of Texas
with fearless devotion...</i>

12:47.921 --> 12:50.460
this gold watch...

12:53.050 --> 12:55.968
<i>and honorary plaque.</i>

12:56.095 --> 13:01.303
<i>Hey, how about that?
How about that? Ain't that somethin'?</i>

13:01.434 --> 13:03.474
Dakota.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.887
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

13:08.067 --> 13:10.355
It's a real honour.

13:10.485 --> 13:13.487
<i>Adios, amigos. Hasta la vista.</i>

13:18.577 --> 13:23.536
<i>Thank you, folks. Drive careful
goin' home now, you hear me?</i>

13:28.504 --> 13:31.956
- Good speech, Dakota.
- The hell with it. Did you get 'em?

13:32.092 --> 13:35.176
- You bet.
- Sorry I was at this hand-job session.

13:35.303 --> 13:38.090
- I'd love to have helped.
- I could have used you.

13:38.223 --> 13:41.140
- Dakota?
- Yeah, Captain?

13:41.267 --> 13:44.718
Can't say as I'm gonna miss you.

13:44.855 --> 13:48.354
Thank you very much, Captain.
And thank you for the watch.

13:48.483 --> 13:51.484
- And you, McQuade...
- Drink, Captain?

13:51.611 --> 13:54.481
My office in ten minutes.

13:57.616 --> 14:00.701
<i>"And you, McQuade..."</i>

14:03.873 --> 14:05.913
Hey, McQuade.

14:13.967 --> 14:16.006
Hi, there.

14:33.653 --> 14:36.524
- Captain?
- Sit down, McQuade.

14:39.993 --> 14:43.861
You think you're pretty damn good,
don't you, McQuade?

14:43.997 --> 14:49.288
In case you didn't know it there's more to
being a Texas Ranger than making busts.

14:49.420 --> 14:52.671
<i>You gotta look good doing it.</i>

14:52.799 --> 14:54.837
Style.

14:56.344 --> 14:59.131
The best always have style.

15:12.026 --> 15:15.609
- I said, sit down.
- I'll stand, Captain.

15:17.782 --> 15:22.859
Now, in terms of
unassisted felony arrests,

15:22.996 --> 15:26.032
I admit your record is unrivalled.

15:26.166 --> 15:32.619
But my kind of Ranger is a model citizen.
A pillar in the community. Goes to church.

15:32.756 --> 15:37.548
He lives clean
and he's got a lovin' wife and kids.

15:37.678 --> 15:40.132
Read it.

15:42.724 --> 15:46.888
It's an editorial by the senator who
happens to approve our annual budget.

15:47.021 --> 15:50.685
I quote: "Ranger JJ McQuade
is a walking symbol

15:50.816 --> 15:56.058
of the brutal, uncooperative, obsolete and
discriminatory nature of Rangers today."

15:56.196 --> 15:57.738
Unquote.

16:02.286 --> 16:05.536
Well, your "lone wolf" attitude
is gonna change.

16:05.664 --> 16:11.916
You're going to start cooperating with the
state and federal agencies. Understand?

16:16.383 --> 16:18.423
Come in.

16:20.638 --> 16:23.260
- You wanted to see me, Captain?
- Yes.

16:23.391 --> 16:27.258
Ranger, meet your new partner.
Deputy Arcadio Ramos.

16:27.394 --> 16:30.893
Arcadio. You can just call me Kayo.

16:32.858 --> 16:35.610
You gotta be kidding.

16:37.322 --> 16:41.699
- It'll be an honour workin' with you.
- Forget it, kid. I work alone.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.032
Where'd you get that piece?

16:44.161 --> 16:47.246
- That's what I'm gonna find out.
- Ranger?

16:51.544 --> 16:53.169
Stay with it, son.

17:31.877 --> 17:36.088
Our Russian friends have failed us. We
will have to finance the coup ourselves.

17:38.550 --> 17:41.504
The shipment has to be in Havana
before Wednesday.

17:41.637 --> 17:43.676
Splendid.

17:48.476 --> 17:50.849
Would you like to count it, Señor Wilkes?

17:50.980 --> 17:54.514
Trust is the most important thing
in our business.

17:54.650 --> 17:56.891
Of course it is.

17:57.361 --> 18:00.148
Now, have the plane loaded at once.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.864
I am in a hurry
to get back to Havana, Señor Wilkes.

18:03.994 --> 18:05.653
Quickly, now.

18:22.429 --> 18:25.050
That quick enough?

18:31.479 --> 18:33.520
Bury them.

18:56.296 --> 18:58.123
Ranger?

19:03.846 --> 19:05.672
Ranger?

19:21.112 --> 19:23.651
Good dog. Good wolf.

19:24.784 --> 19:27.453
Good boy. Good wolf.

19:36.671 --> 19:38.462
<i>Chingao.</i>

19:38.589 --> 19:41.543
What a pisshouse.

19:44.887 --> 19:46.714
Ranger?

19:58.109 --> 20:00.861
What are you doing here?

20:00.988 --> 20:05.732
I came to wake you up.
I'm your new partner, remember?

20:07.035 --> 20:09.705
Kid, get out of here.
And forget that partner crap.

20:09.830 --> 20:11.905
But Captain Tyler...

20:12.040 --> 20:14.791
Tell Tyler to shove it!

20:14.917 --> 20:16.827
<i>¡Chinga a su madre!</i>

20:55.543 --> 20:57.749
Holy shit.

21:28.075 --> 21:30.745
Hey, Ranger, I'd like to apologise.

21:30.870 --> 21:34.951
<i>I didn't mean to barge in on you
this morning.</i>

21:48.555 --> 21:50.844
You can't outrun me. I got superchargers.

21:50.974 --> 21:53.013
Oh, yeah?

21:57.481 --> 21:59.770
Supercharge this.

22:02.443 --> 22:04.187
<i>Damn!</i>

22:07.449 --> 22:09.488
Oh, piss.

22:14.414 --> 22:15.825
Dammit, Ranger!

22:18.086 --> 22:22.165
Aaah! Oh, sh... Aaargh!

22:30.514 --> 22:33.184
<i>¡La pura pinche madre!</i>

22:36.812 --> 22:39.101
<i>Pinche cabrón, Ranger.</i>

22:52.244 --> 22:53.739
Daddy!

22:53.871 --> 22:56.541
- Daddy, hey!
- Hey, sugar.

22:59.085 --> 23:01.920
Hey, what's this, huh?

23:02.046 --> 23:05.796
- About time you stopped by.
- I thought you might like to go riding.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.083
- You mean it?
- I'm takin' the day off.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.128
All right!

23:10.263 --> 23:12.671
- I didn't know you took days off.
- Hi, Molly.

23:12.808 --> 23:16.556
- Where have you been, stranger?
- I've been real busy.

23:16.686 --> 23:20.435
- Oh, boy. Same old trouble?
- My kinda trouble doesn't take vacations.

23:20.566 --> 23:24.894
- Aren't you gonna tell Dad the big news?
- Oh, honey.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.688
Mom, I...

23:26.822 --> 23:29.574
What news?

23:29.700 --> 23:34.445
- Jim, I got a real good job in Las Cruces.
- Las Cruces?

23:34.579 --> 23:37.071
We're gonna move there in two weeks.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.835
- What do you mean "move"?
- Don't get all worked up.

23:41.963 --> 23:45.248
I'm an independent woman now
and I got my own life to live.

23:45.383 --> 23:48.217
I know, but you can
make your life right here.

23:48.343 --> 23:51.261
<i>Oh, Jim.</i>

23:51.388 --> 23:55.849
One day you're gonna meet some real
nice gal who won't mind sitting up nights,

23:55.977 --> 24:00.189
waitin' to see if you're
gonna come home in one piece.

24:00.315 --> 24:03.979
Oh, come on, Jim.
It's a nice town, it'll be good for Sally.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.442
- Honey?
- Oh, hell.

24:10.074 --> 24:13.490
Daddy, this is my boyfriend, Bobby Drew.

24:13.619 --> 24:14.995
Boyfriend?

24:15.121 --> 24:21.325
I heard a lot about you. You were in the
Marines, won a Silver Star and everything.

24:26.633 --> 24:30.417
- Nice to meet you, Bobby.
- Nice to meet you, Ranger.

24:30.553 --> 24:35.465
Bobby, Daddy's takin' me riding. I hope
you don't mind. I'll see you tonight, OK?

24:35.600 --> 24:37.592
Uh, yeah, sure.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.681
- See you later.
- Have a good old time.

24:43.608 --> 24:46.278
Bye. See you later.

24:48.322 --> 24:50.361
Bye, Mom! See ya!

25:26.902 --> 25:29.192
<i>I'm ready to take Foxy out now.</i>

25:29.322 --> 25:32.489
<i>- Just be patient.
- OK.</i>

25:32.617 --> 25:34.443
All right. I'm ready to go.

25:34.578 --> 25:37.863
Pay attention, dummy.
She's got some mustang in her.

25:37.997 --> 25:41.283
- I can handle her, OK? Let's go.
- OK.

25:41.417 --> 25:44.335
- Be careful, honey.
- OK. Easy, Foxy.

25:48.466 --> 25:53.258
Hey. How'd you like to bite that in the butt,
develop lockjaw and be dragged to death?

25:53.388 --> 25:56.305
- Who is she?
- Clark Richardson's widow.

25:56.433 --> 25:58.175
- That's her, huh?
- That's her.

25:58.309 --> 26:01.061
From a poor family.
Married Clark with all that money

26:01.187 --> 26:06.526
just before he got himself squashed
in that Italian racing job. Quite a crash.

26:06.651 --> 26:10.602
Clark ran with a pretty tough crowd
and talk is it wasn't an accident.

26:10.739 --> 26:12.814
But nobody can prove it.

26:12.949 --> 26:17.528
Shame, though.
All that fruit just rotting on the vine.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.747
Doesn't look too rotten to me.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.286
- Sally!
- Foxy!

26:27.714 --> 26:30.466
- Sally!
- Help me!

26:35.264 --> 26:37.553
Help!

26:49.445 --> 26:52.316
It's all right. It's OK.

26:54.741 --> 26:57.612
- You all right, honey?
- Yeah.

26:59.246 --> 27:01.323
Thank you.

27:01.457 --> 27:04.162
- What's your name?
- Sally.

27:04.294 --> 27:07.579
- Next time, Sally, be more careful.
- I will.

27:07.713 --> 27:13.338
I wanna thank you for what you did.
The name's Jim McQuade.

27:13.470 --> 27:16.921
The infamous Texas Ranger.
Pleased to meet you.

27:29.443 --> 27:33.904
This is Rawley Wilkes, my late husband's
partner. Ranger McQuade.

27:34.032 --> 27:37.033
And now you're my partner.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.031
I understand you're very good
with your hands and feet.

27:40.164 --> 27:42.369
Pretty good.

27:42.498 --> 27:45.286
Rawley was all-European
karate champion.

27:45.418 --> 27:47.910
Is that right?

27:48.463 --> 27:50.918
Ranger Brown. Sally.

27:51.049 --> 27:54.133
Ranger McQuade, it was especially nice.

27:59.600 --> 28:04.725
Oh, by the way, Rawley's giving a little
martial arts display by the racetrack.

28:04.855 --> 28:09.564
- Just a little exhibition.
- Why don't you gentlemen drop on by?

28:09.693 --> 28:14.190
- I don't think we...
- Oh, it'd be our pleasure, ma'am.

28:14.323 --> 28:16.695
Good.

28:34.386 --> 28:36.424
Hey, Foxy.

28:38.347 --> 28:40.839
- Wait. What are you doin'?
- I wanna ride.

28:40.975 --> 28:45.685
- Are you sure?
- Sure I'm sure. Excuse me, please.

28:45.814 --> 28:48.055
Gallop. Let's go.

28:50.317 --> 28:56.072
Never backs down, does she? Reminds
you of somebody else in her family.

28:59.827 --> 29:06.032
# But choosin's never easy and
I can't decide which one I'd rather see

29:07.336 --> 29:13.540
# There's a woman from El Paso and I
know she will be comin' here this evening

29:14.967 --> 29:21.172
# She'll be wearing a red dress and
I know the one with whom she'll be leavin'

29:22.851 --> 29:25.935
# There's another girl from Dallas...

29:27.940 --> 29:31.474
- You got Pearl beer?
- No. Heineken, Michelob or Dos Equis.

29:31.610 --> 29:33.650
Forget it.

29:34.905 --> 29:36.982
- Bottom shelf, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:50.962 --> 29:54.297
<i>It's Rawley showing off.</i>

30:02.266 --> 30:05.717
This should be very interesting.

31:08.541 --> 31:14.746
I see we are graced with the presence
of a media favourite, Ranger JJ McQuade.

31:18.844 --> 31:22.427
Care to go for one, Ranger?
A little wager, perhaps?

31:29.814 --> 31:33.397
No, thanks. I don't fight for money.

31:51.627 --> 31:55.377
I don't want you dancin' with no greaser.

31:55.507 --> 31:58.044
You are a greaser, aren't you?

32:21.241 --> 32:23.281
Excuse me a minute.

32:25.037 --> 32:28.240
- Quit while you're ahead, partner.
- Who the hell asked you?

32:28.374 --> 32:30.450
Let me show you.

32:33.712 --> 32:35.752
Come on, tough guy.

32:59.656 --> 33:02.491
Boys are just havin' a little fun.

33:02.617 --> 33:05.404
Do you wanna join the fun?

33:14.463 --> 33:17.248
This is not my idea of fun!

33:22.011 --> 33:26.092
Please let me apologise. Some of my
friends could learn a little manners.

33:26.224 --> 33:29.309
Maybe you need some new friends.

33:32.063 --> 33:33.972
Music! Play!

33:45.327 --> 33:48.411
<i>This was my party.</i>

33:51.125 --> 33:53.580
We should have booked those bastards.

33:53.710 --> 33:59.547
If I locked up every guy who took a swing
at me, half the county'd be behind bars.

33:59.675 --> 34:04.088
Well, you're makin' a real habit
of saving my ass. I appreciate it.

34:04.221 --> 34:08.467
- You take a good punch, kid.
- I'll take old hamburger-face home.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.353
- Good idea.
- Come on, boy.

34:19.027 --> 34:23.571
You look like you could use
a change of scenery. Come on.

34:31.917 --> 34:33.956
I'll drive.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.710
<i>Cuidado, mis cuates, la chota.</i>

34:47.889 --> 34:51.342
Not too popular, are you?

34:51.476 --> 34:53.850
They understand me.

34:53.980 --> 34:56.815
<i>Por favor.</i>

34:56.942 --> 35:01.484
<i>Una botella de mezcal, dos limones
y si me puede limpiar la mesa. Gracias.</i>

35:01.613 --> 35:04.186
- Mezcal?
- Yes.

35:08.495 --> 35:11.033
How about a kiss, baby?

35:12.290 --> 35:14.330
Excuse me.

35:17.712 --> 35:20.169
Time to leave.

35:22.342 --> 35:23.967
Watch out!

35:39.192 --> 35:42.063
- Sally, get back here.
- Nope.

35:43.739 --> 35:47.488
Hey, come on. Open up.
Let me in. Come on, Sally.

35:47.618 --> 35:50.323
- Nope.
- Come on, open the door. Let me in.

35:50.454 --> 35:53.788
- You promise you won't try anything?
- I promise. Let me in.

35:53.916 --> 35:56.324
OK.

35:56.461 --> 35:57.955
- Aaargh!
- Bobby!

35:58.087 --> 36:01.171
- You promised. Cut it out.
- I lied.

36:04.427 --> 36:08.555
- What is it?
- It's coming from down on the highway.

36:08.681 --> 36:10.638
Stay here.

36:10.767 --> 36:12.806
Bobby?

36:29.494 --> 36:31.653
Holy shit.

36:35.333 --> 36:37.374
Let's get out of here.

36:42.382 --> 36:44.505
Get down.

36:51.641 --> 36:53.551
What do you guys want?

36:55.480 --> 36:57.139
No!

36:57.273 --> 36:59.941
Bobby! No!

37:53.037 --> 37:55.410
See you around.

38:35.830 --> 38:39.116
<i>Come in, 6R1.
Can you read me?</i>

38:40.419 --> 38:42.708
<i>- 6R1 here. Over.
- Roger, 6R1.</i>

38:42.839 --> 38:47.299
<i>We've got a multiple fatality and injury
on I-10 south of Estelline.</i>

38:47.426 --> 38:49.550
I'm going home. Is there anyone closer?

38:49.679 --> 38:54.007
<i>Negative. You'd better go. We've been
notified that your daughter's involved.</i>

38:54.141 --> 38:56.181
<i>My daughter?</i>

39:05.694 --> 39:08.150
- Sally McQuade.
- Room 418.

39:09.407 --> 39:11.446
Ranger! Wait!

39:18.082 --> 39:20.241
Please. She needs rest.

39:21.419 --> 39:23.826
She was very lucky.

39:28.343 --> 39:29.718
Bobby...

39:45.986 --> 39:48.025
<i>Bueno.</i>

40:09.176 --> 40:10.718
Howdy, Ranger.

40:10.845 --> 40:13.680
The feds. They've taken over.

40:13.806 --> 40:16.379
Marcus Jackson, FBI, Houston.

40:16.517 --> 40:19.222
- McQuade, Texas Ranger.
- I know.

40:19.353 --> 40:22.556
I'm sorry about your daughter,
but this is a federal case.

40:22.690 --> 40:24.979
From now on, it's out of your jurisdiction.

40:25.110 --> 40:27.980
There's brass everywhere. 9mm.

40:29.363 --> 40:34.440
Excuse me. Get it to the lab. I want a
ballistics report. Let's see what we got.

40:34.577 --> 40:37.412
I guess this is his show.

40:37.538 --> 40:42.367
There were pages blowin'
all over the place when I got here.

40:42.502 --> 40:45.373
I kept this one.

40:45.505 --> 40:48.341
It's a logbook page from an army convoy.

40:48.467 --> 40:50.505
Fort Nelson.

40:51.512 --> 40:52.507
Ranger?

41:01.020 --> 41:05.931
<i>- Hello. Lieutenant Dade, Shipping.
- McQuade, Texas Ranger, El Paso.</i>

41:06.067 --> 41:11.821
I'm calling to verify that shipment
number... 5501 left Fort Nelson yesterday.

41:11.948 --> 41:13.573
<i>Yes, sir, it certainly did.</i>

41:13.700 --> 41:17.614
<i>- What were the contents of those trucks?
- Sir, I'm not at liberty to say.</i>

41:17.746 --> 41:19.822
<i>- Who is?
- Colonel McNeil, sir.</i>

41:19.957 --> 41:22.163
<i>- Would you connect me, please?
- Yes, sir.</i>

41:24.295 --> 41:27.544
<i>- Colonel McNeil's office.
- Could I speak to the colonel?</i>

41:27.674 --> 41:30.627
<i>- He isn't in today.
- When do you expect him?</i>

41:30.759 --> 41:33.002
<i>- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Where is he?</i>

41:33.137 --> 41:35.842
- I don't know.
- Lady, what the hell do you know?

41:35.974 --> 41:39.093
<i>I only work for the colonel.
I don't sleep with him.</i>

41:39.227 --> 41:42.227
You won't get anywhere that way, Ranger.

41:42.939 --> 41:44.480
Follow me.

41:55.618 --> 41:59.070
- What the hell are you doing?
- Accessing into Aristotle.

41:59.205 --> 42:02.325
- Who?
- The military central computer.

42:02.458 --> 42:06.788
You see, I borrowed the codes
from the Texas Criminal Info Center.

42:14.512 --> 42:18.261
- Shit.
- If you get it figured out, kid, let me know.

42:19.851 --> 42:22.603
Wait, Ranger, I'm in. I got it.

42:24.148 --> 42:26.519
I got it.

42:30.737 --> 42:33.524
They got a shitload of guns. Oh, man.

42:35.325 --> 42:37.816
- Look at that.
- Holy shit.

42:41.582 --> 42:45.745
- Good job, kid. Really a good job.
- Thanks, Ranger.

43:07.733 --> 43:10.817
<i>Here's our little Judas goat.</i>

43:17.910 --> 43:20.484
- What's his connection?
- His name's Snow.

43:20.622 --> 43:23.028
Hustler, dealer, pimp, you name it.

43:23.165 --> 43:26.867
There isn't any dirt
he doesn't have his hands in.

43:32.717 --> 43:35.671
What do you say
we pay him a visit, Ranger?

43:36.305 --> 43:37.714
Let's go.

43:48.191 --> 43:49.982
- You gonna park?
- Hang on.

43:50.109 --> 43:51.652
What?

44:13.633 --> 44:16.172
You're learning, kid.

44:29.067 --> 44:31.355
I see I got a lot more to learn.

44:31.485 --> 44:34.320
Come on, kid.

44:34.446 --> 44:36.486
Son of a bitch.

44:52.966 --> 44:55.004
Whoops.

45:04.018 --> 45:05.596
<i>¿ Señora?</i>

45:05.729 --> 45:09.311
<i>¿ Dondé fue el hombre que pasó ahorita?</i>

45:10.733 --> 45:12.773
<i>Gracias.</i>

45:47.021 --> 45:50.141
- Remember me, Snow?
- J-Jesus!

45:50.274 --> 45:52.432
Watch it!

46:17.135 --> 46:19.709
Round the front.

46:25.476 --> 46:27.136
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

47:09.271 --> 47:11.726
Goddammit! Shit!

48:04.119 --> 48:05.945
Don't!

48:11.292 --> 48:14.210
- No! No!
- Come on!

48:27.142 --> 48:28.720
Come on.

48:28.852 --> 48:32.102
- Take him.
- I'll call the fire department.

48:32.230 --> 48:36.857
Later. I need to talk to him
before I let the feds have him.

48:44.159 --> 48:48.157
You're gettin' more slippery all the time,
ain't you?

48:48.288 --> 48:52.500
Come on. How many times
have I busted you, you son of a bitch?

48:55.171 --> 48:59.298
- Argh! It hurts my hand!
- Yeah, it does, don't it?

49:03.345 --> 49:06.346
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

49:06.473 --> 49:08.680
Can I borrow that contraption?

49:11.979 --> 49:13.438
Sure.

49:30.372 --> 49:33.160
What are you gonna do?

49:47.056 --> 49:48.800
Stop! Wait!

49:51.394 --> 49:53.636
<i>Got something to say, pissant?</i>

49:53.771 --> 49:57.687
I know who you want.
It's the Mexican Mafia man, Falcon.

49:57.818 --> 49:59.395
Emilio Falcon?

49:59.528 --> 50:02.694
They're heistin' guns everywhere.
All they can get.

50:02.822 --> 50:06.405
What are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

50:06.535 --> 50:11.327
I said, what are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

50:15.376 --> 50:21.379
Shit! They fly 'em off to Mexico,
to Central America, to terrorists and stuff!

50:21.509 --> 50:23.916
All over the place.

50:24.052 --> 50:26.010
I don't know.

50:26.138 --> 50:30.552
They're gonna kill my son, man!
Goddammit!

50:31.768 --> 50:34.474
Please? Please?

50:34.605 --> 50:37.476
Please, man. Let me go, goddammit.

50:37.608 --> 50:43.612
You stay right there, boy.
Don't you even breathe fast.

50:50.955 --> 50:53.280
Thanks. I figured you'd bring him around.

50:53.416 --> 50:56.120
It has been my pleasure, JJ.

51:00.382 --> 51:02.836
Hang onto him till I get back.

51:02.966 --> 51:06.502
I'm gonna clean up
and pay a little visit to Señor Falcon.

51:06.638 --> 51:10.552
- What about me, Ranger?
- Hold down the fort... partner.

51:10.683 --> 51:12.723
<i>Bueno.</i>

51:16.064 --> 51:20.192
Let's go have
another little talk with our guest.

51:20.318 --> 51:25.443
<i>What you gonna do? What you
gonna do, man? I'm not scared of you.</i>

51:49.848 --> 51:51.841
What the hell?

51:51.976 --> 51:54.015
Damn!

52:13.164 --> 52:15.655
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, hi.

52:15.791 --> 52:19.741
- I just thought I'd clean up a bit.
- Lady, if I want a maid, I'll hire one.

52:19.879 --> 52:25.502
Jim, you're a hopeless slob.
Let me have my cord.

52:25.634 --> 52:27.628
What's this?

52:27.762 --> 52:29.802
Vitamins.

52:32.141 --> 52:34.383
Where's my beer?

52:35.854 --> 52:38.225
In the garbage.

52:52.162 --> 52:55.448
Can't you see you're killing yourself?

52:58.584 --> 53:00.625
Lady...

53:00.754 --> 53:05.381
if I want to kill myself,
it's my own business.

53:14.852 --> 53:18.018
Fine. That's just fine.

53:18.147 --> 53:20.185
<i>Adios.</i>

53:27.323 --> 53:29.149
Shit.

53:34.996 --> 53:38.081
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

53:43.964 --> 53:46.004
Look, uh...

53:47.343 --> 53:50.428
I, uh... I didn't mean to be such a...

53:53.182 --> 53:55.638
What I mean is...

53:57.020 --> 53:59.475
Lola, I...

54:01.941 --> 54:03.981
I'm sorry.

54:07.863 --> 54:12.739
You know, you could use some
improvement. You really could.

54:14.830 --> 54:16.869
Yeah, I know.

54:33.807 --> 54:36.263
Hey! I'm not the trash.

54:42.232 --> 54:45.068
OK, you're asking for it.

54:52.242 --> 54:54.116
OK. Here.

55:26.694 --> 55:30.277
- Sorry. This is by invitation only.
- This is my invitation.

55:30.406 --> 55:32.234
Hey.

55:48.759 --> 55:52.210
So, the lone wolf pays us a visit.

55:53.305 --> 55:55.630
As you can see, mine's bigger.

55:55.765 --> 55:58.303
Mine's loaded.

55:59.644 --> 56:04.353
- Tell me, Ranger, do you like games?
- I'm not here to discuss games, Falcon.

56:04.482 --> 56:06.475
<i>Damn!</i>

56:06.609 --> 56:08.650
- Then what brings you?
- Guns.

56:08.779 --> 56:13.441
Guns? You know, at one time
I had a great interest in guns.

56:13.575 --> 56:17.408
- Somebody tells me you still do.
- And you would like to believe him.

56:17.538 --> 56:20.456
Two nights ago,
several men died in a convoy heist.

56:20.583 --> 56:22.908
Yes. Of course I'm aware of these things.

56:23.043 --> 56:27.871
However the certain party who is stealing
the guns was once a close friend of mine.

56:28.006 --> 56:31.256
He might take it personally
if I were to divulge details.

56:31.384 --> 56:34.588
He is a businessman, just like I am, and...

56:34.722 --> 56:40.595
Why am I telling you this? You will find
these things out for yourself in good time.

56:40.728 --> 56:45.556
- Meanwhile I'll enjoy watching the game.
- It may be a game to you, Falcon.

56:45.691 --> 56:51.195
But if I find out you're playing,
I'm gonna have your little ass.

56:51.321 --> 56:57.526
Well, Ranger, it's been a pleasure having
a chat with you. But I'm afraid I must go.

57:01.958 --> 57:05.292
<i>Oh, and Ranger?
The man you caught - Snow.</i>

57:05.420 --> 57:10.247
<i>I understand he won't live
through the night. Adios now.</i>

57:12.886 --> 57:17.097
<i>- You can't get through?
- I'm sorry, 6R1. I can't help you.</i>

57:17.224 --> 57:20.427
<i>That line's been reported out of order.</i>

57:20.560 --> 57:22.267
Mm-hm.

57:22.396 --> 57:25.811
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
Snow calls it. There's his 30 cents.

57:25.941 --> 57:29.025
I call it. There's my 30 cents.
What have you got, baby?

57:29.152 --> 57:33.861
- Best hand all day.
- Look at that. Pair of kings.

57:33.990 --> 57:37.526
Look at that, folks.
Three eights. Isn't that delicious?

57:37.662 --> 57:43.746
You didn't win here. I'm gonna take a little
bit of your money. How much this time?

57:43.876 --> 57:47.921
- A quarter.
- One quarter, you wish to try. 25 cents.

57:48.047 --> 57:50.454
Sit still, boy!

57:51.008 --> 57:55.337
Now, you are going to love this game.
You're gonna get a marvellous hand.

57:55.471 --> 58:00.892
Unfortunately it is going to be slightly
inferior to mine, but you're going to like it.

58:01.018 --> 58:05.478
What do you got, boy? What do I hear
from you? What do I hear from you?

58:05.607 --> 58:08.393
- I need another beer.
- Oh, you need another beer.

58:08.525 --> 58:12.393
- No cards up the sleeve, huh?
- No need to, with a patsy like you.

58:12.530 --> 58:18.200
You learn when you play this game
that you really play people, not...

58:18.327 --> 58:21.945
You don't play cards, you play people.

58:22.081 --> 58:24.572
Loose lips sink ships.

58:24.708 --> 58:26.950
You understand?

58:27.087 --> 58:29.873
I thought you would.

58:30.005 --> 58:33.339
I just play the cards good and tight.

58:42.143 --> 58:43.472
Oh, fuck!

59:14.051 --> 59:18.095
<i>No! Don't kill me!</i>

59:25.771 --> 59:28.393
<i>Dakota! You all right?</i>

59:28.524 --> 59:31.728
Dakota! Answer me!

01:00:38.261 --> 01:00:39.543
Kayo.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.766
Kayo?

01:01:25.727 --> 01:01:27.766
It's OK, kid.

01:01:38.573 --> 01:01:40.447
Captain.

01:01:40.575 --> 01:01:43.612
Ranger, I think you know Agent Jackson.

01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:48.826
This is Colonel Remsing
and ATF Special Agent Burnside.

01:01:50.585 --> 01:01:53.373
- Feds.
- You better read this.

01:01:57.343 --> 01:01:59.749
- Federal indictment?
- With your name on it.

01:01:59.886 --> 01:02:03.754
You're dealing with
international gun smugglers. Butchers.

01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:08.185
They provide every damn terrorist
organisation in the world with our guns.

01:02:08.312 --> 01:02:11.098
I can't stand by you on this one, Ranger.

01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:16.226
You withheld evidence, harboured
a key witness in a federal investigation,

01:02:16.362 --> 01:02:21.439
caused a good man's death and violated
every jurisdictional clause in the book.

01:02:21.576 --> 01:02:23.900
I've no choice but to put you on probation.

01:02:24.036 --> 01:02:28.745
You'll take a mandatory vacation without
pay until this matter can be cleared up.

01:02:28.874 --> 01:02:30.997
You want my star, Captain?

01:02:31.126 --> 01:02:34.329
That won't be necessary. Not yet.

01:03:08.456 --> 01:03:11.126
Hey, Wolf. How's my boy?

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.966
Jim...

01:03:38.486 --> 01:03:40.527
What's wrong?

01:03:41.782 --> 01:03:44.653
Nothing worth talking about.

01:04:10.978 --> 01:04:13.054
Hey.

01:04:13.355 --> 01:04:14.554
Hey.

01:04:14.691 --> 01:04:16.932
Are you OK?

01:04:19.445 --> 01:04:21.818
Yeah, I'm OK.

01:05:51.706 --> 01:05:53.994
Lola!

01:06:00.882 --> 01:06:04.927
- You think they got the message?
- Just like you planned.

01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:12.176
Damn.

01:07:04.363 --> 01:07:06.190
Jim?

01:07:17.377 --> 01:07:19.915
Come on. Let's go home.

01:07:34.435 --> 01:07:37.639
I'll see you soon, honey.

01:07:37.772 --> 01:07:41.901
- Daddy, aren't you coming in?
- No, I'd better get going.

01:07:44.822 --> 01:07:47.194
I don't wanna leave you.

01:07:54.498 --> 01:07:57.581
You're becoming quite a lady, you know.

01:08:01.756 --> 01:08:04.292
I'm gonna miss you, honey.

01:08:05.384 --> 01:08:08.883
- I love you, Daddy.
- Oh, I love you too.

01:08:58.188 --> 01:09:01.059
Pretty jittery for a Ranger.

01:09:09.448 --> 01:09:13.399
- Pretty quiet for a fed.
- Oh, I make it my business.

01:09:13.536 --> 01:09:17.487
Looks like somebody
doesn't like you, McQuade.

01:09:17.624 --> 01:09:21.751
- I make a few enemies here and there.
- Yeah? So do I.

01:09:24.464 --> 01:09:27.299
- What do you want?
- I came to enlist your help.

01:09:27.426 --> 01:09:31.673
See, I'm not the token nigger
when it comes to following the rules.

01:09:31.805 --> 01:09:32.754
Get to the point.

01:09:32.889 --> 01:09:37.184
<i>I know they got a drop-off point
somewhere between here and Big Bend.</i>

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:41.938
- That's 500 square miles.
- Who knows? We might just get lucky.

01:09:52.743 --> 01:09:56.361
Pretty desolate terrain, McQuade.

01:10:05.131 --> 01:10:08.001
<i>There are no roads up here.</i>

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:25.025
- This could take weeks.
- Yeah, it's gettin' late.

01:10:25.152 --> 01:10:28.106
We'd better turn back.

01:10:41.126 --> 01:10:43.166
See somethin'?

01:10:44.379 --> 01:10:46.456
Take us down over there.

01:10:51.428 --> 01:10:56.553
There's been some activity here. Pretty
well-organised for the middle of nowhere.

01:10:56.683 --> 01:10:59.969
There's nothing
indicated here on the map.

01:11:08.195 --> 01:11:09.939
What's goin' on?

01:11:10.489 --> 01:11:13.774
I've got a bad feeling about this place.

01:11:45.609 --> 01:11:49.902
<i>Well, Ranger, how does it feel
to be baby-sitting Burnside?</i>

01:11:50.029 --> 01:11:52.603
<i>Candy-ass feds.</i>

01:12:13.178 --> 01:12:16.629
McQuade! What is this?
A damn goat trail?

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:21.261
- If you wanna turn back, that's fine by me.
- Who the hell does he think he is?

01:12:21.395 --> 01:12:26.733
He knows this country better than you
know the warts on your wife's backside.

01:12:26.858 --> 01:12:30.110
Why don't we all line up and kiss his ass?

01:12:54.345 --> 01:12:57.097
- I'll be damned.
- You need some help?

01:12:59.599 --> 01:13:02.886
Let's show 'em what this baby can do.

01:13:04.521 --> 01:13:07.688
What the hell does he think he's doin'?

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:09.893
What the hell?

01:13:10.028 --> 01:13:11.023
Hang on.

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:16.314
- What's he got there? A damn tank?
- Why don't you just shut the hell up?

01:14:21.725 --> 01:14:24.395
Let's go.

01:15:27.001 --> 01:15:29.705
A real pretty setup, huh?

01:15:30.921 --> 01:15:33.591
It's been too easy.

01:15:37.886 --> 01:15:41.387
Let's check around
before we make a move.

01:15:43.225 --> 01:15:44.850
Burnside, hold it.

01:15:44.977 --> 01:15:46.720
- This is the FBI.
- Burnside!

01:15:46.854 --> 01:15:49.689
Drop your weapons
or we'll commence firing.

01:15:49.815 --> 01:15:51.773
Get down!

01:16:05.415 --> 01:16:08.167
- Run for it. I'll cover you.
- I'm staying here.

01:16:08.293 --> 01:16:12.539
Get your ass out of here!
That's an order, Trooper!

01:16:50.335 --> 01:16:52.707
You son of a bitch!

01:17:04.308 --> 01:17:07.724
<i>Now this is my idea of fun.</i>

01:17:08.437 --> 01:17:10.513
Rawley, that's enough!

01:17:10.647 --> 01:17:15.725
Look, darling. I have a surprise for you.
One of your new friends.

01:17:16.653 --> 01:17:19.061
Rawley, please! Rawley!

01:17:19.198 --> 01:17:21.867
I waited a long time for this.

01:17:21.993 --> 01:17:25.408
Please don't do it this way, Rawley!

01:17:25.538 --> 01:17:30.698
Very well, my dear.
Get his truck. I have a better idea.

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:34.411
Get her out of here.

01:17:38.468 --> 01:17:42.133
You murderer! You murderer!
Let go of me!

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:48.101
Pick him up.

01:17:59.822 --> 01:18:02.195
Put him in it.

01:18:37.235 --> 01:18:39.644
Something to remember you by.

01:18:46.913 --> 01:18:48.739
<i>Adios.</i>

01:20:23.093 --> 01:20:25.550
Freeze, assholes!

01:21:01.633 --> 01:21:03.127
Ranger!

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.548
You son of a bitch!

01:21:06.513 --> 01:21:08.552
Ranger!

01:21:13.104 --> 01:21:14.811
Ranger?

01:21:15.981 --> 01:21:20.607
Don't die on me now, dammit.
Dammit, don't die on me now!

01:21:25.657 --> 01:21:28.114
Get me a beer, kid.

01:21:29.537 --> 01:21:31.743
Yes, sir!

01:21:48.389 --> 01:21:51.259
Aren't we a sorry bunch of bastards?

01:22:05.072 --> 01:22:07.943
Whose idea was this, anyway?

01:23:40.670 --> 01:23:44.715
- Oh, Jim, thank God you're here.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:23:44.842 --> 01:23:49.135
It's Sally. She's missing.
I called all of her friends.

01:23:49.262 --> 01:23:53.722
OK, calm down, calm down, calm down.
Are you sure you checked everywhere?

01:23:56.895 --> 01:23:58.686
Oh, Jim.

01:24:01.650 --> 01:24:04.604
I'll take care of this.

01:24:05.486 --> 01:24:09.485
Is it "Ranger" or "Mr" McQuade?
May I come in, please?

01:24:09.617 --> 01:24:13.032
- Say what you came to say.
- I came to offer my assistance.

01:24:13.162 --> 01:24:19.532
A business acquaintance of mine, Rawley
Wilkes, has disappointed me greatly.

01:24:19.668 --> 01:24:24.331
I'm not interested in your problems.
I'll get him my own way, in my own time.

01:24:24.465 --> 01:24:28.130
- Wilkes has your daughter, McQuade.
- Oh, Jim! Jim!

01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:31.629
It's his way of saying
he would enjoy your company again.

01:24:31.763 --> 01:24:33.839
I want my daughter back, Falcon.

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.770
Please, please. I'm more than willing
to help you retrieve your loved one,

01:24:41.899 --> 01:24:44.735
providing, of course,
that you return the favour.

01:24:44.861 --> 01:24:47.232
What's your deal?

01:24:47.363 --> 01:24:51.527
I will tell you precisely where
you can find Mr Wilkes and your daughter.

01:24:51.659 --> 01:24:56.736
However, in return I would like
certain assets of mine protected.

01:24:56.873 --> 01:24:59.909
I wish to claim what is mine.

01:25:00.501 --> 01:25:02.459
Jim...

01:25:02.587 --> 01:25:04.958
Anything. Please.

01:25:50.052 --> 01:25:53.422
- Hey, partner. Where you headed?
- Mexico.

01:25:53.556 --> 01:25:56.676
- Mexico? What the hell for?
- They got my daughter.

01:25:56.809 --> 01:26:00.308
- Hold on. I'm comin'.
- It's not your fight.

01:26:02.815 --> 01:26:06.647
Hey, Ranger!
You're in no shape to do this alone!

01:26:35.473 --> 01:26:39.173
<i>Dinero, por favor. Dinero, por favor.</i>

01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:45.099
<i>Gracias. Muchas gracias.</i>

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:47.605
<i>- ¿ Se lo lleno, señor?
- Sí.</i>

01:26:51.198 --> 01:26:54.317
<i>Vaya con Dios. God protect you.</i>

01:27:06.171 --> 01:27:08.294
<i>Señor?</i>

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:11.211
They are wishing you well.

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:31.938
You didn't think
I'd miss all the fun, did you?

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:58.171
- A new toy, huh?
- Just a little surprise.

01:28:00.059 --> 01:28:02.348
You gotta be kidding.

01:28:04.063 --> 01:28:07.397
Hey. You guys remember me?

01:28:07.525 --> 01:28:10.562
How we gonna
smuggle him back to Texas?

01:28:10.696 --> 01:28:12.106
That's your problem.

01:28:38.432 --> 01:28:40.056
Can you make it?

01:28:40.183 --> 01:28:44.430
I didn't come this far
just to drop dead on the trail, did I?

01:28:44.563 --> 01:28:47.647
It's all downhill from here on.

01:29:06.377 --> 01:29:07.242
OK!

01:29:21.267 --> 01:29:23.592
We split up from here. Stick to the plan.

01:29:23.728 --> 01:29:26.016
- Right.
- Good luck.

01:30:30.378 --> 01:30:33.879
Hello, Sally. How you doing?

01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:39.512
What does he want from me?
Why is he keeping me here?

01:30:39.638 --> 01:30:40.635
Rawley...

01:30:46.562 --> 01:30:48.935
Daddy! Daddy!

01:30:56.405 --> 01:30:58.232
Jim...

01:30:59.908 --> 01:31:02.696
I'm so happy you're alive.

01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:20.595
Where do you think you're going, dude?

01:31:23.975 --> 01:31:27.059
- Let's go. It's gonna get rough round here.
- McQuade.

01:31:46.289 --> 01:31:48.662
Get that crap off.

01:32:05.976 --> 01:32:08.467
Let's get out of here.

01:32:15.736 --> 01:32:18.489
<i>Sally! Sally!</i>

01:32:20.532 --> 01:32:22.905
Remember me, greaser?

01:32:28.249 --> 01:32:31.250
Yeah. I never forget an asshole.

01:32:37.759 --> 01:32:39.086
Stay here.

01:33:14.838 --> 01:33:17.127
Oh, shit.

01:33:17.257 --> 01:33:18.883
Dammit.

01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:45.948
Agh!

01:33:49.832 --> 01:33:51.208
Come on. Come on.

01:34:18.945 --> 01:34:21.982
Damn! I knew I forgot something.

01:35:20.299 --> 01:35:24.298
Welcome to my hacienda, Mr McQuade.

01:35:26.097 --> 01:35:28.967
How nice of you to pay a social visit.

01:36:22.654 --> 01:36:24.279
Daddy!

01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:21.248
Daddy!

01:37:22.756 --> 01:37:24.667
Come on.

01:37:25.676 --> 01:37:27.919
- Daddy!
- No! Sally! Sally!

01:37:28.055 --> 01:37:30.047
No! Stop it!

01:37:46.031 --> 01:37:48.736
Sally! Sally...

01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:52.222
Are you all right, honey?

01:38:58.271 --> 01:39:00.727
Gimme that gun.

01:39:00.857 --> 01:39:04.107
- McQuade!
- Rawley! No!

01:39:14.955 --> 01:39:16.995
Come on.

01:39:22.254 --> 01:39:24.293
Jim...

01:39:24.423 --> 01:39:26.961
I didn't betray you.

01:39:30.512 --> 01:39:35.933
Rawley killed my husband
and forced me to be his partner.

01:39:36.059 --> 01:39:39.642
I had no choice. He would have killed me.

01:39:49.073 --> 01:39:51.825
I love you.

01:40:10.052 --> 01:40:11.844
Hey, McQuade!

01:40:47.132 --> 01:40:48.959
Daddy...

01:41:11.907 --> 01:41:15.953
My arsenal! My investments!
What have you done?

01:41:16.079 --> 01:41:19.946
Don't move, don't talk,
and everything will be just fine.

01:41:20.958 --> 01:41:23.579
We made a deal, McQuade.

01:41:23.712 --> 01:41:26.665
You made the deal, shorty. Not me.

01:41:28.508 --> 01:41:31.213
You wanna try for three?

01:41:35.307 --> 01:41:38.342
McQuade, wait. Wait!

01:41:38.476 --> 01:41:41.642
<i>You can't leave me here.
What about the Federales?</i>

01:41:41.771 --> 01:41:46.932
- You know how to fly this thing?
- I sure as hell don't. But he does.

01:41:49.238 --> 01:41:52.108
You can't leave me! McQuade!

01:41:52.241 --> 01:41:53.782
McQuade!

01:41:53.909 --> 01:41:55.866
Wait! McQuade!

01:41:55.994 --> 01:41:59.529
That's my chopper!
McQuade, come back here!

01:41:59.664 --> 01:42:03.283
McQuade! That's my chopper! McQuade!

01:42:16.265 --> 01:42:20.642
Can we print the comment that you made
about your daring rescue?

01:42:20.769 --> 01:42:23.604
And the FBI credits
the Texas Rangers with the rescue?

01:42:23.731 --> 01:42:26.518
- Absolutely correct.
- Can I have another picture?

01:42:26.650 --> 01:42:30.398
Why not?
Ranger, you feel up to a picture?

01:42:33.115 --> 01:42:38.276
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna say it's
a pleasure having this man on my team.

01:42:38.412 --> 01:42:42.992
I feel responsible for every move he's
made. After all, I taught him all he knows.

01:42:43.126 --> 01:42:46.708
- He has style. The best always have style.
- Bullshit.

01:42:46.838 --> 01:42:48.877
Daddy!

01:42:49.006 --> 01:42:51.498
- Dad!
- That's my girl.

01:42:52.927 --> 01:42:56.296
I can't wait to show you our new house.
Come on, let's go.

01:42:56.431 --> 01:42:58.009
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi, Molly.

01:42:58.141 --> 01:43:01.592
Gimme a hug. I really
appreciate your helping us move.

01:43:01.728 --> 01:43:05.310
- My pleasure.
- Come on, let's go.

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:12.189
Oh, boy. Here we go.

01:43:19.996 --> 01:43:24.040
Ranger, we got a 10-31 in progress
at the Texas National Bank.

01:43:24.167 --> 01:43:27.370
- I'm on vacation.
- They've got hostages.

01:43:27.505 --> 01:43:30.956
- We really need you, Ranger.
- Comin', Jim?

01:43:32.509 --> 01:43:34.716
Daddy?

01:43:38.765 --> 01:43:41.138
Hostages?

01:43:45.648 --> 01:43:47.308
Daddy?

01:43:47.441 --> 01:43:49.481
Are you comin'?

01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.814
See you later. Let's go.

01:43:55.950 --> 01:43:58.737
JJ McQuade, you'll never change!

01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:06.955
Oh, hell.
