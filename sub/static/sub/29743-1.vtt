00:30.980 --> 00:32.980
<i>Gestures are all that I have.</i>

00:36.060 --> 00:37.940
<i>I have no words I can rely on,</i>

00:37.980 --> 00:40.940
<i>because my tongue was designed
long and flat</i>

00:41.490 --> 00:43.280
<i>and is therefore an ineffective tool</i>

00:43.320 --> 00:46.450
<i>for making complicated
polysyllabic sounds.</i>

00:54.830 --> 00:56.580
<i>And that is why I'm here now...</i>

00:57.340 --> 00:59.000
<i>waiting for Denny to come home...</i>

01:00.340 --> 01:02.840
<i>lying in a puddle of my own making.</i>

01:06.760 --> 01:07.850
Yo, Enz!

01:13.180 --> 01:14.100
Enzo?

01:15.190 --> 01:17.020
<i>I hear the worry in his voice.</i>

01:19.610 --> 01:20.940
What happened, pal?

01:24.110 --> 01:25.320
Enz.

01:25.360 --> 01:27.030
<i>I can smell the day on him.</i>

01:27.370 --> 01:30.740
<i>Motor oil and gasoline and roast chicken.</i>

01:30.790 --> 01:32.330
Can you get up, bud?

01:41.090 --> 01:42.170
I'm here, buddy.

01:42.460 --> 01:43.630
I'm right here.

01:45.470 --> 01:46.430
Okay.

01:47.430 --> 01:49.300
<i>If only I could speak...</i>

01:50.050 --> 01:51.680
<i>I would tell him not to worry.</i>

01:55.640 --> 01:59.060
<i>I saw a documentary
about Mongolia on TV once.</i>

02:00.190 --> 02:02.320
<i>In Mongolia, they believe that when a dog</i>

02:02.360 --> 02:04.900
<i>has finished living
his lifetimes as a dog,</i>

02:04.940 --> 02:06.990
<i>his next incarnation will be as a man.</i>

02:07.410 --> 02:08.740
I'm right here, bud.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.450
There he is.

02:11.490 --> 02:15.710
<i>I realize this would mean
losing all my memories, my experiences,</i>

02:16.080 --> 02:17.540
<i>but I have a plan.</i>

02:18.420 --> 02:21.250
<i>I will try to imprint
what I know on my soul,</i>

02:21.920 --> 02:24.800
<i>carry it so deeply
in the pockets of my existence</i>

02:24.840 --> 02:27.930
<i>that when I open my eyes
and look down at my new hands,</i>

02:28.260 --> 02:29.720
<i>I will already know.</i>

02:29.760 --> 02:31.140
There's my Enzo.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.180
<i>I will be ready.</i>

02:34.930 --> 02:36.140
<i>I will remember.</i>

02:42.440 --> 02:44.530
<i>He picked me out of a pile of pups,</i>

02:45.030 --> 02:47.570
<i>a tangled mass of paws and tails.</i>

02:48.700 --> 02:51.030
<i>He'd stopped at the farm on his way home</i>

02:51.070 --> 02:52.910
<i>-from the speedway at Yakima.
</i>-Hey.

02:54.540 --> 02:57.370
<i>Even back then,
I knew I was different than other dogs.</i>

02:58.500 --> 03:01.330
<i>My soul just felt more... human.</i>

03:01.380 --> 03:02.420
This one.

03:03.170 --> 03:04.550
Definitely this one.

03:04.590 --> 03:06.760
-The pick of the litter.
<i>-She always said that.</i>

03:08.930 --> 03:10.180
Well, just a minute now.

03:10.220 --> 03:12.010
We were thinking of keeping that one.

03:12.390 --> 03:14.010
<i>He always said that, too.</i>

03:14.760 --> 03:15.770
Hey.

03:17.180 --> 03:18.270
How much?

03:26.070 --> 03:28.110
<i>And so, I had my first glimpse</i>

03:28.150 --> 03:29.360
<i>at the rest of my life.</i>

04:45.650 --> 04:46.980
Tony! Denny's here.

04:48.190 --> 04:49.320
Hey-hey!

04:49.570 --> 04:50.900
Just wait for it.

04:52.650 --> 04:54.030
I didn't know you were getting a puppy.

04:54.070 --> 04:55.200
Neither did I.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.950
Saw a sign on the road and,
I don't know, something came over me.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.370
Isn't that right, Enzo?

04:59.410 --> 05:01.700
"Enzo?" You mean, like Ferrari?
That's rad.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.870
You can't look after a dog.
You're never home.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.420
You're gonna ruin
the moment, aren't you?

05:05.460 --> 05:07.460
Our best friend,
he's gonna ruin the moment.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.840
I'll take him on the road with me.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.590
He'll be my good luck charm.

05:10.630 --> 05:11.710
Hey, you coming to our show tonight?

05:11.760 --> 05:13.260
We're opening for The Scoffs at The Dive.

05:13.590 --> 05:15.800
Oh, no, he can't. He's got
a new puppy to look after.

05:16.430 --> 05:17.930
See, he's good luck already.

05:18.850 --> 05:21.100
I got the call this morning,
they need an extra driver.

05:21.930 --> 05:24.770
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I'll, uh,
leave you a pass at the gate.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.270
Okay, two passes.

05:29.270 --> 05:30.650
Who is this guy again?

05:31.110 --> 05:32.070
That's right.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.610
<i>I liked my new home.</i>

05:34.110 --> 05:35.740
<i>It only lacked for grass,</i>

05:35.780 --> 05:37.240
<i>but I figured I could make do.</i>

05:37.280 --> 05:38.410
Enzo, no!

05:38.450 --> 05:39.700
Don, I got to call you back.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.830
And... go ahead.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.830
Okay, bud, fire away.

05:47.790 --> 05:50.920
<i>Denny seemed unusually interested
in my bathroom habits.</i>

05:51.800 --> 05:53.460
Go on. Go ahead.

06:04.810 --> 06:06.140
Of course you did.

06:10.730 --> 06:11.980
Okay, pal...

06:12.980 --> 06:14.440
it's time to turn in.

06:14.690 --> 06:16.360
Big day tomorrow at the race.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.450
So just be a good boy.

06:21.370 --> 06:22.540
Get some sleep, okay?

06:49.440 --> 06:50.520
Okay.

06:51.270 --> 06:52.360
All right.

06:55.690 --> 06:57.030
Okay.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.370
Okay.

07:07.410 --> 07:08.540
<i>Of course. Just rub that in...</i>

07:14.300 --> 07:16.590
<i>I'd later learn
it was called a television.</i>

07:16.630 --> 07:19.840
<i>And, in time, it would teach me
much about human behavior.</i>

07:20.550 --> 07:21.800
<i>But that night,</i>

07:21.840 --> 07:23.890
<i>it felt like a window
into a whole new world.</i>

07:24.140 --> 07:25.600
You like that, huh?

07:26.640 --> 07:27.730
<i>Like it?</i>

07:28.060 --> 07:29.390
<i>No, I loved it.</i>

07:36.230 --> 07:37.570
Right foot on the gas.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.030
Ease into the turn.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.500
<i>And even better was</i>

07:50.540 --> 07:52.040
<i>when he took me to the race itself.</i>

07:56.590 --> 07:57.760
Denny!

07:59.670 --> 08:01.840
-Look!
-It's a puppy.

08:02.430 --> 08:04.720
<i>Denny's apartment
was home, but this...</i>

08:05.430 --> 08:07.430
<i>this was where I truly belonged.</i>

08:13.020 --> 08:15.360
<i>It was more thrilling
than I could've imagined.</i>

08:23.530 --> 08:24.780
What do you think, Enzo?

08:24.820 --> 08:26.660
<i>I thought it was heaven on earth.</i>

08:27.870 --> 08:29.200
What'd you say his name is again?

08:29.250 --> 08:30.460
Denny Swift.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.710
Number 96 car.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.500
He teaches for me from time to time

08:33.539 --> 08:36.090
when he needs cash, but you trust me,
this kid's a diamond in the rough.

08:36.130 --> 08:37.090
Copy that.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.850
<i>The heat coming off the track,</i>

08:52.890 --> 08:55.730
<i>the breathless speed and precision
of the pit crew...</i>

08:56.440 --> 08:57.980
<i>I was in awe of it all.</i>

09:00.820 --> 09:02.530
He did a year in Formula Three.

09:02.990 --> 09:05.370
Got picked up
by Zip Simone's Audi program.

09:05.410 --> 09:07.870
Started making a name for himself,
but then Zippy went bankrupt.

09:07.910 --> 09:08.830
Then he lost his ride.

09:10.580 --> 09:11.750
Clear!

09:16.670 --> 09:18.800
You really serious
about starting your own team,

09:18.840 --> 09:20.460
there's your man right there.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.630
He's been down almost
a full lap this whole stint.

09:22.670 --> 09:24.340
It's not about who's got the heavier foot.

09:24.380 --> 09:25.510
It's about the feel.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.890
Denny was the first to make the call
to switch to rain tires.

09:36.480 --> 09:37.730
Step over here.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.280
Hey. Watch this.

09:56.330 --> 09:57.710
In all my years of racing,

09:57.750 --> 10:00.130
I've never seen anyone
like Denny in the wet.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.380
Reminds me what they
used to say about Senna.

10:02.420 --> 10:04.880
"When it rains, it doesn't rain on him."

10:20.980 --> 10:22.480
<i>-And when he won...
-Enzo!</i>

10:22.530 --> 10:24.860
<i>...I felt like I'd witnessed
true greatness.</i>

10:31.160 --> 10:32.240
Yeah!

10:35.500 --> 10:36.830
First race, huh?

10:37.080 --> 10:38.750
What'd you think, boy? You like it?

10:39.130 --> 10:40.340
Did you like it?

10:40.670 --> 10:42.840
-Hey, kid, you got a minute?
-Hey.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.800
I want you to meet Sean Wright.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.550
Hey. Denny Swift.

10:46.590 --> 10:49.300
He sold his tech company
for some obscene amount of money

10:49.340 --> 10:51.550
and now he's determined
to waste it all racing GTs.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.060
Yeah, I think I've read about you.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.390
That was some win today.

10:55.270 --> 10:57.100
You think you could drive
that way for him?

10:58.270 --> 10:59.150
Try me.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.150
<i>My first year went by in a blur.</i>

11:03.190 --> 11:04.400
Wait. Let me see.

11:05.610 --> 11:07.900
<i>I realize nobody
has a perfect childhood,</i>

11:07.950 --> 11:10.820
<i>but I'd contend
that mine came fairly close.</i>

11:13.700 --> 11:15.620
<i>Denny began racing for Wright full-time</i>

11:15.950 --> 11:18.330
<i>and took me with him whenever he could,</i>

11:18.370 --> 11:20.710
<i>like a four-legged member of the pit crew.</i>

11:29.300 --> 11:30.550
Hey, Enz, you good?

11:31.050 --> 11:32.680
<i>I was better than good.</i>

11:33.510 --> 11:35.560
Go! Clear!

11:39.190 --> 11:41.150
<i>Call it fate, call it luck.</i>

11:41.190 --> 11:44.190
<i>All I knew was I was meant to be his dog.</i>

11:48.490 --> 11:49.740
<i>Denny always said</i>

11:49.780 --> 11:52.200
<i>the best drivers
focus only on the present.</i>

11:52.240 --> 11:53.700
<i>Never dwelling on the past,</i>

11:53.740 --> 11:55.030
<i>never committing to the future.</i>

11:57.500 --> 11:59.250
-Go get it!
-Woo!

11:59.910 --> 12:02.080
<i>Reflection must come
at a later time,</i>

12:02.330 --> 12:04.540
<i>which is why drivers compulsively record</i>

12:04.590 --> 12:06.960
<i>their every move
with their in-car cameras.</i>

12:07.010 --> 12:08.260
I got to turn earlier.

12:09.050 --> 12:10.550
Get a better run on that corner.

12:11.260 --> 12:13.970
<i>I learned so much
from him about balance,</i>

12:14.010 --> 12:16.260
<i>anticipation, patience.</i>

12:17.100 --> 12:18.980
Car goes where your eyes go, Enz.

12:19.020 --> 12:23.060
<i>And I would fantasize that
one day I, too, might actually race.</i>

12:23.100 --> 12:25.650
<i>Congratulations
on a spectacular win today.</i>

12:25.690 --> 12:27.900
<i>Not an easy race, by any stretch.</i>

12:27.940 --> 12:30.030
<i>Well, you know, I'm a risk-taker.</i>

12:30.860 --> 12:32.280
Man, that win was all you.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.070
This guy hasn't even mentioned you once.

12:34.450 --> 12:36.580
You're way too good for this guy, Denny.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.540
You got to start getting
your own sponsors.

12:39.580 --> 12:40.710
Yeah, maybe.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.500
<i>My drivers look to me as their leader...</i>

12:42.870 --> 12:45.040
Turn this clown off. Put on the Mariners.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.180
<i>There's an old saying
I'd often hear Denny repeat.</i>

12:52.720 --> 12:55.220
<i>"No race was ever won in the first corner,</i>

12:55.680 --> 12:57.510
<i>but many have been lost there."</i>

12:57.890 --> 12:58.970
Just you and me, Enz.

12:59.930 --> 13:01.310
Always you and me.

13:02.890 --> 13:04.690
...and then accelerating through.

13:04.730 --> 13:07.190
<i>Nothing was more
important to us than racing.</i>

13:07.940 --> 13:09.690
<i>I knew it was only a matter of time</i>

13:09.730 --> 13:12.900
<i>before Denny reached his goal
of racing Formula One in Europe.</i>

13:13.700 --> 13:14.700
Come on!

13:15.450 --> 13:18.120
<i>And the whole world
would see him the way I did.</i>

13:18.160 --> 13:19.040
Good boy.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.370
<i>He'd be adored by fans everywhere.</i>

13:23.580 --> 13:25.500
<i>His victories the stuff of legend.</i>

13:27.170 --> 13:31.130
<i>His name inscribed alongside
the very best our sport has ever known.</i>

13:44.850 --> 13:47.400
<i>But for now,
he was my champion alone.</i>

13:51.110 --> 13:52.650
<i>And then she showed up.</i>

13:55.360 --> 13:56.950
-That was great.
-Yeah.

13:57.950 --> 13:58.950
Hey.

13:59.780 --> 14:01.580
Enzo, this is Eve.

14:01.620 --> 14:03.000
Hi, Enzo.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.040
How you doing?

14:04.290 --> 14:05.870
<i>My first impression of Eve</i>

14:05.920 --> 14:07.960
<i>was as complicated
as the scents in the air.</i>

14:08.210 --> 14:10.170
I'm not really much of a dog person.

14:10.420 --> 14:13.670
<i>A mélange of produce,
shampoo and pheromones.</i>

14:13.720 --> 14:15.840
Yeah, well, he's more person than dog.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.220
<i>Denny was clearly taken
with her grooming.</i>

14:18.720 --> 14:21.470
<i>She probably bathed every day,
for all I knew.</i>

14:21.510 --> 14:23.100
Does he always stare at people
like this?

14:23.730 --> 14:25.020
If he likes them.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.020
So, are you a chef or something?

14:28.060 --> 14:30.230
No, I teach English as a second language,

14:30.270 --> 14:31.570
and one of my students is Thai,

14:31.900 --> 14:33.650
and she made this curry
that was incredible.

14:33.690 --> 14:35.950
-But it looks like you have to go.
-I don't know what's gotten into him.

14:35.990 --> 14:37.200
It was nice to meet you.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.240
Come here, come on!
Hey, uh, Eve?

14:40.160 --> 14:43.200
My, uh... my friends,
they play in a band

14:43.240 --> 14:46.500
and they're playing a show
at Nemo's tonight.

14:46.540 --> 14:48.120
I thought, you know,
if you didn't have plans...

14:48.170 --> 14:49.210
"Head Injury"?

14:49.250 --> 14:51.170
Yeah, they're Seattle's
third most popular--

14:51.210 --> 14:52.250
"Soundgarden tribute band."

14:52.300 --> 14:53.550
Yeah, I mean,
according to them.

14:55.670 --> 14:56.840
That sounds like fun.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.220
It does?

14:58.260 --> 15:00.850
Yeah! Yeah, no, we'll...
we'll make it fun.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.010
-All right, I'll see you then.
-Cool.

15:03.350 --> 15:04.430
Bye.

15:05.850 --> 15:06.850
Come on.

15:08.520 --> 15:09.980
Well, I thought you guys rocked.

15:10.020 --> 15:12.860
See, Mike? He was freaking out
because we skipped a verse on "Spoonman."

15:13.190 --> 15:14.570
We skipped a verse?

15:14.610 --> 15:17.150
Now imagine this
all throughout high school.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.700
So, which song was your favorite?

15:18.950 --> 15:21.070
The... second-to-last one.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.030
The one with the 12-minute guitar solo?

15:23.080 --> 15:24.290
Yeah, that was the best part!

15:25.080 --> 15:26.660
Denny, marry this girl.

15:27.660 --> 15:28.870
Do you want another?

15:28.920 --> 15:30.420
No, thanks. Could I have some water?

15:30.460 --> 15:31.790
-Yeah, sure. Mike?
-Yep.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.000
So, uh... you two just met, huh?

15:34.050 --> 15:35.050
Yeah.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.970
-And?
-Dude.

15:37.380 --> 15:39.720
And I think he's really nice.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.010
Just wait till you see him race,
then you're really gonna fall in love.

15:42.050 --> 15:42.930
Dude!

15:43.600 --> 15:44.890
What? I was just--

15:46.720 --> 15:48.480
So, when do I get to see you race?

15:49.350 --> 15:51.480
<i>As if Denny
would ever fall for that.</i>

15:52.110 --> 15:53.360
Yes!

15:54.690 --> 15:56.940
<i>She knew almost nothing
about racing,</i>

15:56.990 --> 15:59.610
<i>but for some reason,
Denny didn't seem to mind.</i>

16:00.990 --> 16:03.780
<i>I assumed she would soon
be in our rearview mirror.</i>

16:03.830 --> 16:07.160
<i>But by spring, it was clear
Eve wasn't going anywhere.</i>

16:10.460 --> 16:12.960
<i>I'll admit I envied the
attention he lavished on her,</i>

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
<i>with her...</i>

16:14.540 --> 16:16.880
<i>...opposable thumbs
and plump buttocks.</i>

16:20.680 --> 16:22.640
In his regular car, yes.

16:23.220 --> 16:25.180
well, what does he know
about teaching English?

16:26.600 --> 16:28.060
Yeah, my point exactly.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.390
<i>And her taste in television programs</i>

16:30.440 --> 16:32.150
<i>left something to be desired.</i>

16:32.190 --> 16:33.940
Will you stop?

16:36.400 --> 16:38.360
<i>Denny never tired of pleasing her.</i>

16:43.360 --> 16:44.700
<i>All for his reward,</i>

16:44.740 --> 16:46.830
<i>which usually meant lots
of stroking and...</i>

16:47.240 --> 16:48.370
<i>nuzzling.</i>

16:51.210 --> 16:52.830
-How was your class?
-It was good.

16:52.870 --> 16:55.170
<i>Did I envy her engaging smile?</i>

16:55.210 --> 16:56.920
<i>Her effortless laugh?</i>

16:57.420 --> 16:58.460
<i>Perhaps I did.</i>

17:00.220 --> 17:02.800
<i>For she was a person, unlike me.</i>

17:06.720 --> 17:08.760
I'll go make us some breakfast.

17:08.810 --> 17:09.770
-Really?
-Yeah.

17:10.390 --> 17:11.599
Okay, thanks.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.480
Hey, Enzo.

17:19.819 --> 17:22.030
You don't mind if I love him too, do you?

17:23.069 --> 17:24.990
<i>As if I had a say in the matter.</i>

17:30.040 --> 17:32.250
<i>They were married
at a magnificent palace</i>

17:32.290 --> 17:33.870
<i>with its very own ocean.</i>

17:34.710 --> 17:37.790
<i>The kind of place I had assumed
only existed on television.</i>

17:39.460 --> 17:41.300
<i>I tried my best to be helpful.</i>

17:44.130 --> 17:45.510
<i>I minded my manners,</i>

17:45.550 --> 17:49.180
<i>resisted snacking on the trays
of exquisite appetizers</i>

17:49.220 --> 17:50.600
<i>and made sure to do my business</i>

17:50.640 --> 17:53.230
<i>in the flowerbed farthest
from the festivities.</i>

17:55.480 --> 17:57.480
<i>The place belonged to Eve's parents,</i>

17:57.730 --> 17:59.150
<i>Trish and Maxwell...</i>

18:00.150 --> 18:02.940
<i>who I confess I first mistook for twins.</i>

18:04.950 --> 18:07.120
Would the bearer please
bring the rings forward?

18:07.700 --> 18:08.580
Aww!

18:10.030 --> 18:11.200
<i>When the time came,</i>

18:11.240 --> 18:13.410
<i>I did as I was instructed,
for Denny's sake.</i>

18:16.170 --> 18:18.590
-Good boy.
-Come on, Enz. Come here, bud.

18:20.090 --> 18:21.000
Hey.

18:21.840 --> 18:22.920
Good boy.

18:26.010 --> 18:27.140
With this ring,

18:27.390 --> 18:28.640
I thee wed.

18:29.470 --> 18:30.390
Eve?

18:31.180 --> 18:32.270
With this ring,

18:32.720 --> 18:33.770
I thee wed.

18:36.940 --> 18:38.730
<i>And so, we became a family...</i>

18:41.520 --> 18:43.820
<i>to varying degrees of enthusiasm.</i>

18:44.110 --> 18:45.740
Think he could've shaved
for his own wedding?

18:46.070 --> 18:47.860
-Maxwell.
-What?

18:48.110 --> 18:49.490
It's just an observation.

18:50.030 --> 18:51.120
Please.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.950
No one's good enough for her
in your eyes.

18:54.370 --> 18:57.420
I like him, I do,
but I love my daughter

18:57.830 --> 18:59.750
and the man races cars for a living.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.960
You don't think I'm within my rights
to be a little concerned?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.760
No, not if Eve isn't.

19:04.090 --> 19:07.550
<i>I've learned that people will say
just about anything in front of me,</i>

19:07.590 --> 19:09.260
<i>as I am only a dumb dog.</i>

19:09.640 --> 19:11.800
I put a call in
to Andy Neuberger last week.

19:11.850 --> 19:14.640
He said a driver who's been on the circuit
as long as Denny has,

19:14.680 --> 19:17.890
if it was gonna break for him,
most likely would've happened by now.

19:18.140 --> 19:20.610
But Eve says he's been doing great lately.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.770
I knew I'd find you two in here.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.320
Come on, it's cake time.

19:24.650 --> 19:26.400
Daddy was making his drink.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.660
<i>After the wedding came the move.</i>

19:32.910 --> 19:34.660
<i>I was of two minds about it.</i>

19:35.450 --> 19:37.250
<i>I now had room to roam.</i>

19:37.790 --> 19:39.540
<i>But the old apartment was ours,</i>

19:39.960 --> 19:41.040
<i>Denny and me.</i>

19:52.350 --> 19:54.260
<i>I tried to communicate my feelings.</i>

19:57.480 --> 19:59.640
-What was that?
-It was Enzo. He's just excited.

19:59.980 --> 20:02.860
<i>But my gestures
were inevitably misinterpreted.</i>

20:08.950 --> 20:10.490
<i>Moreover, there was a mysterious new aura</i>

20:10.530 --> 20:12.620
<i>about Eve that, for some reason,</i>

20:12.660 --> 20:16.120
<i>prevented me from maintaining
any resentment toward her.</i>

20:27.590 --> 20:29.760
It's Watkins Glen,
which I usually do really well at.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.930
-And that's in New York, right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

20:31.970 --> 20:34.600
You could take a couple days off
and we could get out there early.

20:34.640 --> 20:35.640
I'm pregnant.

20:38.020 --> 20:39.310
Wait, what?

20:40.480 --> 20:41.770
You freaked out?

20:41.810 --> 20:43.770
No! No, I'm not!
Wait, are you freaked out?

20:44.150 --> 20:45.650
A little, yeah.

20:51.610 --> 20:53.030
Did you know about this?

20:55.620 --> 20:58.120
<i>I never really grasped
the concept of money</i>

20:58.160 --> 21:00.620
<i>and why humans always
seemed to be in need of it.</i>

21:01.960 --> 21:04.540
<i>But Denny became more and more
preoccupied with it.</i>

21:04.580 --> 21:05.960
All right!

21:06.340 --> 21:08.090
<i>He began to train harder than ever.</i>

21:10.920 --> 21:12.930
<i>He took on extra teaching sessions,</i>

21:12.970 --> 21:14.890
<i>competed in every race he could.</i>

21:15.470 --> 21:16.600
I'll miss you.

21:16.640 --> 21:19.350
<i>This meant my spending
more and more time alone with Eve.</i>

21:19.770 --> 21:21.350
Come on, Enz. Come on.

21:25.310 --> 21:26.440
<i>To be honest,</i>

21:26.480 --> 21:29.400
<i>I still didn't share
Denny's overt affection for her.</i>

21:29.440 --> 21:31.240
Hey, buddy, thank you so much.

21:32.780 --> 21:34.950
<i>But we developed
a rhythm of our own.</i>

21:35.370 --> 21:36.820
That's very nice.

21:37.870 --> 21:40.330
<i>At times,
she even reminded me of my own mother</i>

21:40.370 --> 21:42.460
<i>when she would sigh and shrug herself</i>

21:42.500 --> 21:44.290
<i>-into a prone position.
</i>-Oh, God.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.290
<i>It must be amazing to have a body</i>

21:47.340 --> 21:49.590
<i>that can carry an entire creature inside.</i>

21:50.170 --> 21:52.630
<i>I mean, other than a tapeworm,
which I've had.</i>

21:53.510 --> 21:55.260
Do you want to know what it feels like?

22:00.220 --> 22:01.430
Good boy.

22:03.430 --> 22:06.100
Did you feel that?
Did you feel that kick?

22:07.730 --> 22:09.480
Sweet boy, come here.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.190
It's okay. Come here.

22:13.650 --> 22:14.900
That's okay.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.620
<i>I couldn't imagine what was going on
inside Eve's magic sack</i>

22:19.660 --> 22:21.660
<i>where the baby was being assembled.</i>

22:22.660 --> 22:24.620
<i>I just hoped it would look like me.</i>

22:30.170 --> 22:32.760
Enzo... slow down,
it's your only one.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.720
-It's cozy.
-I love it.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.720
It probably looks exactly
like the last one

22:37.760 --> 22:38.970
I got you, but...

22:39.890 --> 22:41.140
Do you like it?

22:41.180 --> 22:42.930
I got it from Pike Place.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.520
It's 100 percent handmade.

22:44.980 --> 22:47.230
-It's...
-Your favorite shade of pink.

22:48.810 --> 22:49.770
It is.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.150
You okay?

22:55.190 --> 22:57.320
Yeah, I'm fine. I just want
to see what it looks like on.

22:58.870 --> 23:00.370
Hey, can we talk about

23:00.410 --> 23:02.120
this whole midwife thing again?

23:02.620 --> 23:05.330
-Honey, we've been over this.
-Yeah, I know.

23:05.370 --> 23:06.330
I'm just saying.

23:06.370 --> 23:08.460
I mean, you know,
I was born in a hospital,

23:08.500 --> 23:09.580
you were born in a hospital.

23:09.630 --> 23:12.590
I know, but I really want to do it here.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.960
I mean,
Tanya birthed her twins at home.

23:15.470 --> 23:18.010
And she said that these two women she used
were amazing.

23:18.050 --> 23:19.090
Okay.

23:20.180 --> 23:21.050
Hey.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.060
Hi, Mom. Merry Chri--

23:24.770 --> 23:25.640
Okay.

23:26.180 --> 23:28.270
Someone from
something-something... Penske?

23:28.770 --> 23:29.810
On Christmas Day?

23:31.110 --> 23:32.110
Hello.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.280
Yeah, hi.

23:35.940 --> 23:37.360
What is this hat?

23:37.950 --> 23:39.610
<i>They say dogs can't see color.</i>

23:39.860 --> 23:40.780
Oh, okay.

23:41.070 --> 23:42.950
ENZO. <i>Apparently, neither could Denny.</i>

23:43.740 --> 23:46.250
Yeah, I'll, um,
hear back from you again, okay.

23:46.290 --> 23:47.210
Bye.

23:48.580 --> 23:49.710
What is it?

23:49.750 --> 23:51.920
That was Judd Murphy
from Team Penske.

23:52.380 --> 23:53.460
He's down a driver

23:53.500 --> 23:56.210
and he just offered me a seat
in the 24 Hours of Daytona.

23:56.510 --> 23:58.010
That's good, right?

23:58.050 --> 23:59.800
Good? I mean, it's great!

23:59.840 --> 24:00.840
It's Daytona.

24:01.220 --> 24:02.850
This is the shot I've been wanting.

24:02.890 --> 24:04.510
This could change everything for me.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.140
Oh, my God, Denny, that's great!

24:08.350 --> 24:10.270
It's the last weekend of January.

24:11.270 --> 24:13.690
So? The due date
isn't till February 15th.

24:13.730 --> 24:15.020
Well, it's cutting it awful close.

24:16.030 --> 24:18.150
Hey, what if you came with me? Huh?

24:18.700 --> 24:20.410
We don't have to fly.

24:20.450 --> 24:23.160
Denny. I'm not driving to Florida.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.870
But you have to do this.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.450
There is nothing to debate here.

24:27.700 --> 24:28.830
This is your shot.

24:28.870 --> 24:30.080
If you finish well,

24:30.120 --> 24:31.620
all these doors start to open.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.500
You're not worried about timing... at all?

24:36.380 --> 24:38.720
When have you known me
to be early for anything?

24:42.300 --> 24:44.890
<i>I didn't know a human
could make such sounds.</i>

24:48.850 --> 24:50.480
<i>Denny missed it all, however,</i>

24:50.520 --> 24:52.730
<i>as he was driving through
the night at Daytona.</i>

24:53.190 --> 24:54.810
<i>Denny Swift in the #22 car</i>

24:54.860 --> 24:56.820
<i>putting in a tremendous performance,</i>

24:56.860 --> 24:58.280
<i>considering the team was in 10th place</i>

24:58.320 --> 24:59.990
<i>-only an hour ago.
</i>-You're doing wonderfully, Eve.

25:02.490 --> 25:04.700
<i>Approaching hour 17 of this marathon race,</i>

25:04.740 --> 25:05.870
<i>and the rain is really pouring.</i>

25:05.910 --> 25:07.580
I want to talk to Denny.
Can you call him?

25:07.620 --> 25:08.870
Just keep pushing, okay?

25:09.330 --> 25:13.120
<i>With Swift back in the #22 car,
he's snapping at the heels of car #17.</i>

25:13.170 --> 25:14.330
One more push.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.470
<i>Unbelievable!
Denny Swift has taken the lead</i>

25:20.510 --> 25:22.840
<i>in a magnificent show of skill.</i>

25:24.470 --> 25:26.680
Hi, sweet girl.

25:28.430 --> 25:29.890
You're nice and warm.

25:29.930 --> 25:31.980
All right. We'll give you two
some time alone.

25:32.020 --> 25:33.940
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.440
Shoo now, pup!

25:37.110 --> 25:38.570
No, he can stay.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.490
Yeah.

25:42.530 --> 25:43.610
Enzo.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.660
<i>The scent was...</i>

25:45.700 --> 25:46.910
<i>unprecedented.</i>

25:47.950 --> 25:50.750
Come here, sweet boy. Come here.

25:53.460 --> 25:56.630
<i>I had never encountered a creature
quite so beautiful.</i>

25:56.670 --> 25:57.840
Zoë...

25:58.550 --> 25:59.840
this is Enzo.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.300
He's your family, too.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.050
And he'll always protect you.

26:24.990 --> 26:26.660
-Hey, how is everything?
-Hi! She's fine.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.740
-She's okay?
-Yes, just fine.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.410
Hey.

26:30.450 --> 26:31.540
Yeah.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.500
She's been waiting for her daddy.

26:38.750 --> 26:40.170
I should've been here.

26:41.340 --> 26:42.630
Honey, she's a day old.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.220
I know, but still...

26:45.930 --> 26:47.180
You're here now.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.310
This is why we met.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.940
To make this perfect little thing.

27:04.530 --> 27:05.950
I still don't understand.

27:06.740 --> 27:08.410
We lost. It's no big deal.

27:11.530 --> 27:14.080
We were leading by a lap
going into the last stint.

27:14.370 --> 27:18.120
And... I told Murph
I felt up to finishing, but...

27:18.460 --> 27:20.040
the sponsors were pressuring him

27:20.080 --> 27:23.000
to go with this
wonder kid from California

27:23.050 --> 27:24.840
who'd been doing a bunch of press lately.

27:26.050 --> 27:28.010
Ten minutes in, the kid hit the wall.

27:28.050 --> 27:29.220
Totaled the car.

27:31.640 --> 27:32.930
But you drove well.

27:33.890 --> 27:36.940
Yeah, it doesn't really mean a whole lot
if your team doesn't finish.

27:37.980 --> 27:39.060
It's okay.

27:39.980 --> 27:41.940
Really. There's gonna be other races.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.030
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:56.790 --> 27:58.500
Zoë. You okay?

28:02.420 --> 28:04.000
Where is she? It's been too long!

28:05.920 --> 28:07.470
<i>The twins, who rarely visited,</i>

28:07.510 --> 28:10.130
<i>now stopped by frequently
to clutter our home</i>

28:10.180 --> 28:11.340
<i>with garish gifts.</i>

28:13.010 --> 28:14.430
<i>Denny pretended not to mind,</i>

28:14.470 --> 28:15.930
<i>but something about the zebra</i>

28:15.970 --> 28:17.270
<i>put me ill at ease.</i>

28:18.100 --> 28:20.060
Look at those pretty eyes.

28:20.100 --> 28:21.350
Hello, baby girl.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.230
-Dad, she needs a change.
-Oh, I'll do it!

28:23.270 --> 28:24.320
Yeah.

28:25.860 --> 28:27.440
Yeah, Grandma's got you.

28:27.940 --> 28:28.950
Denny!

28:30.820 --> 28:32.820
-It's coming along.
-Thanks.

28:34.950 --> 28:37.410
I watched some of that race
of yours, by the way.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.500
How's that boy doing,
the one who crashed?

28:39.540 --> 28:41.460
We've had this conversation before.

28:44.130 --> 28:45.420
Still, you have a daughter now.

28:46.210 --> 28:48.300
Say, for instance,
you get seriously injured,

28:48.720 --> 28:49.970
or God forbid, killed...

28:50.380 --> 28:52.300
-I won't.
-You can't promise that.

28:52.340 --> 28:53.640
Yes, I can.

28:54.300 --> 28:58.680
I promise you that I will always provide
for Eve and Zoë, no matter what.

28:58.730 --> 29:02.190
And I swear to you
that I will put my safety first,

29:02.230 --> 29:05.150
even if that means
losing every race that I enter.

29:08.650 --> 29:10.650
Bye. Bye, honey. Love you.

29:15.240 --> 29:19.620
<i>It amazed me, the power exerted
by a creature as tiny as our little Zoë.</i>

29:22.580 --> 29:24.960
<i>A power she wielded over me as well...</i>

29:26.420 --> 29:29.920
<i>with no more effort
than the earth does the moon in its orbit.</i>

29:43.440 --> 29:46.020
<i>I was an integral figure
in her entertainment,</i>

29:46.730 --> 29:48.520
<i>leaping after tennis balls</i>

29:48.570 --> 29:50.570
<i>and scrambling back to catch them</i>

29:50.610 --> 29:53.990
<i>then dancing like a four-legged clown
to catch them again.</i>

29:54.610 --> 29:55.620
Run!

29:58.330 --> 30:00.620
You ready, birthday girl?
Okay, here we go.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.210
<i>I was so immersed in her world</i>

30:02.250 --> 30:04.580
<i>that I'd lose count
of the weeks and months.</i>

30:04.620 --> 30:07.460
Ready, steady...

30:07.960 --> 30:09.050
go!

30:11.710 --> 30:13.380
<i>And when she would
tell her playmates</i>

30:13.420 --> 30:15.090
<i>that I was her big brother,</i>

30:15.130 --> 30:16.890
<i>my heart would swell with pride.</i>

30:18.140 --> 30:19.260
Hot potato!

30:21.390 --> 30:22.560
Stinky Drawers!

30:22.600 --> 30:23.850
She's coming in.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.140
Go! She's coming in hot!

30:25.730 --> 30:26.900
Good boy.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.530
Everyone has to wait
their turn for a snack,

30:38.830 --> 30:39.830
even zebras.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.200
Right, teacher?

30:41.950 --> 30:43.290
-Daddy!
-Hi!

30:43.960 --> 30:45.000
Hey!

30:45.040 --> 30:46.750
Hey, I'm sorry I missed
your dance recital.

30:46.790 --> 30:48.250
Mommy told me all about it.

30:48.290 --> 30:50.750
-Did you win?
-No, sweet pea, not this one.

30:52.550 --> 30:53.720
Better?

30:53.760 --> 30:54.840
You have no idea.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.010
Thanks for taking care of our girls, Enz.

31:01.510 --> 31:03.560
Okay, so what do we got here?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.560
Well, this is my second grade class.

31:07.350 --> 31:10.020
Feels like I'm always at the track
or getting on a plane.

31:10.770 --> 31:12.940
Feels that way for me too sometimes.

31:14.110 --> 31:15.570
It'll get easier.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.450
You okay?

31:17.780 --> 31:20.070
Just a headache.
I was up late grading papers.

31:25.460 --> 31:27.500
It wasn't supposed
to take this long, you know.

31:28.460 --> 31:30.880
Dream's always been Formula One,
but it feels...

31:31.210 --> 31:34.210
like I'm just kind of treading water.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.090
Hey...

31:36.340 --> 31:38.380
no race was ever won on the first corner.

31:39.260 --> 31:40.390
Yeah.

31:41.550 --> 31:43.140
You still love it, don't you?

31:43.770 --> 31:45.020
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

31:47.980 --> 31:49.440
Maybe that's not enough.

31:50.730 --> 31:51.900
I don't know.

31:54.650 --> 31:57.900
Apex offered me a seat at Laguna Seca
for next weekend.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.860
I told them I needed to think about it.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.580
You're just tired.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.250
Yeah.

32:11.830 --> 32:15.090
<i>I spent a sleepless night
contemplating what Denny had said.</i>

32:16.090 --> 32:17.300
<i>Quit racing?</i>

32:17.590 --> 32:20.180
<i>He was a racecar driver
the way I was a dog.</i>

32:21.430 --> 32:22.550
<i>It was his nature.</i>

32:23.220 --> 32:24.390
<i>His destiny.</i>

32:28.180 --> 32:29.890
<i>According to Mongolian folklore,</i>

32:29.940 --> 32:32.230
<i>the dogs are able to see
into the spirit world...</i>

32:32.270 --> 32:33.730
Zoë, honey, dinner's ready!

32:33.770 --> 32:35.230
I want to wait for Daddy.

32:35.530 --> 32:37.110
Daddy's teaching tonight.

32:37.530 --> 32:39.450
Five more minutes?

32:39.490 --> 32:41.240
Okay. Enzo, dinner!

32:41.610 --> 32:42.620
Yes!

32:55.800 --> 32:59.170
<i>And then all my worries about Denny
were eclipsed by a smell.</i>

33:00.470 --> 33:03.090
<i>An odor coming
from her ears and sinuses like...</i>

33:03.680 --> 33:04.800
<i>decay.</i>

33:05.050 --> 33:06.260
<i>Like rotting wood.</i>

33:13.150 --> 33:15.610
<i>Given a facile tongue,
I could have warned her.</i>

33:15.650 --> 33:17.570
Don't give me a hard time, too, buddy.

33:18.150 --> 33:21.780
<i>Instead, all I could do was watch
and feel empty inside</i>

33:21.820 --> 33:24.450
<i>because there was nothing
I could do to help her.</i>

33:27.450 --> 33:29.040
<i>In the zebra's mute stare,</i>

33:29.080 --> 33:31.370
<i>I could sense it mocking my predicament.</i>

33:32.580 --> 33:34.920
<i>Eve had assigned me to protect Zoë.</i>

33:38.800 --> 33:41.220
<i>But no one had been
assigned to protect Eve.</i>

33:55.940 --> 33:58.520
Hey, hey, shh. You're gonna wake up Zoë.

34:00.690 --> 34:01.690
Come on.

34:08.790 --> 34:10.699
Since when do you watch my in-cars?

34:11.120 --> 34:14.540
How come you go through the turns
so much faster than the other cars?

34:14.920 --> 34:15.920
Well...

34:16.460 --> 34:18.130
most drivers are afraid of the rain,

34:18.170 --> 34:19.800
because it's an unpredictable element.

34:20.050 --> 34:21.460
You know, they're forced to react to it.

34:22.880 --> 34:25.010
And if they're reacting at speed...

34:25.469 --> 34:26.719
then they're probably too late,

34:26.760 --> 34:28.429
so they should be afraid of it.

34:28.889 --> 34:30.929
Well, I'm afraid just watching it.

34:31.719 --> 34:33.639
Yeah, but if you intentionally
make the car do something,

34:33.679 --> 34:35.100
you don't have to predict.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.480
You control the outcome.

34:36.940 --> 34:39.230
So, you skid the car
before it skids itself?

34:39.270 --> 34:40.280
Yeah.

34:41.030 --> 34:42.110
Yeah.

34:42.150 --> 34:43.570
When I'm in a racecar,

34:43.860 --> 34:45.949
I'm the creator of my own destiny.

34:47.570 --> 34:49.699
"That which you manifest is before you."

34:51.790 --> 34:53.040
Create your own conditions

34:53.330 --> 34:54.659
and rain is just rain.

34:59.250 --> 35:01.800
Tomorrow morning you're gonna
call the folks at Apex

35:01.840 --> 35:04.670
and you're gonna tell them
that you'll see them in Laguna Seca.

35:07.010 --> 35:09.100
And you can't give up, not ever.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.220
Not for us.

35:10.680 --> 35:11.890
Not for anyone.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.600
Promise me.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.400
I promise.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.650
<i>At that moment,
I finally understood Denny's love for Eve</i>

35:21.690 --> 35:24.780
<i>and why for so long
I had been afraid to love her myself.</i>

35:27.200 --> 35:29.410
<i>She was my unpredictable element.</i>

35:31.450 --> 35:32.790
<i>She was my rain.</i>

35:40.460 --> 35:42.000
<i>It's looking
to be a beautiful day here</i>

35:42.050 --> 35:45.170
<i>at Laguna Seca Raceway
in Salinas, California.</i>

35:45.220 --> 35:48.300
<i>We have a deep field of 43 GT cars</i>

35:48.340 --> 35:50.720
<i>and an impressive roster
of drivers.</i>

36:01.560 --> 36:03.230
-Mommy?
-Go pack your bag.

36:03.270 --> 36:05.650
We're gonna to Grandma and Grandpa's
for a few days until Daddy gets home.

36:05.690 --> 36:06.570
Okay?

36:07.200 --> 36:08.820
Are you feeling sick?

36:08.860 --> 36:11.410
I just really need to rest.

36:11.450 --> 36:12.410
Please?

36:24.380 --> 36:25.380
Come on.

36:25.420 --> 36:27.340
<i>It all happened so fast.</i>

36:29.930 --> 36:31.720
<i>In five minutes they were gone.</i>

36:32.680 --> 36:33.970
<i>But I wasn't gone.</i>

36:34.640 --> 36:36.020
<i>I was still there.</i>

36:37.850 --> 36:40.980
<i>Denny always said panic's
a driver's worst enemy.</i>

36:41.940 --> 36:43.310
<i>So, I did not panic.</i>

36:43.360 --> 36:45.650
<i>I did not overcorrect or freeze,</i>

36:46.400 --> 36:49.900
<i>even though I knew Denny wouldn't be home
for at least another two days.</i>

36:52.530 --> 36:53.780
<i>But I'm a dog.</i>

36:54.200 --> 36:56.660
<i>And when God denied dogs
the use of thumbs,</i>

36:56.700 --> 37:00.370
<i>He gave us the ability to survive
without food for extended periods.</i>

37:07.090 --> 37:09.170
<i>So, although a thumb
would've been very helpful,</i>

37:09.220 --> 37:11.680
<i>allowing me to turn a doorknob,
for instance,</i>

37:12.720 --> 37:15.890
<i>my second-best tool
was my ability to go without food.</i>

37:18.810 --> 37:22.350
<i>The longer my isolation continued,
the more anxious I became.</i>

37:24.650 --> 37:26.400
<i>What if Denny never returned?</i>

37:30.240 --> 37:32.360
<i>With only a limited supply
of drinking water,</i>

37:32.410 --> 37:35.530
<i>I had no way of knowing
how long I'd have to make it last.</i>

37:39.370 --> 37:42.000
<i>I sustained myself
with the odd stray Cheerio</i>

37:42.040 --> 37:43.330
<i>Zoë had dropped...</i>

37:45.250 --> 37:48.500
<i>and suffered the indignity
of relieving myself on the mat...</i>

37:49.050 --> 37:51.170
<i>waiting for my ordeal to end.</i>

38:05.360 --> 38:07.650
<i>It was roughly 40 hours
into my solitude</i>

38:07.690 --> 38:09.610
<i>when I think I began to hallucinate.</i>

38:11.530 --> 38:14.070
<i>I'd just discovered
some remnants of spilled yogurt</i>

38:14.110 --> 38:15.370
<i>when I heard a noise.</i>

38:40.770 --> 38:42.230
<i>It was the zebra.</i>

38:52.740 --> 38:53.860
<i>I stalked the creature</i>

38:53.900 --> 38:56.360
<i>as it performed its brutal burlesque,</i>

38:56.410 --> 38:58.410
<i>not sure how much more
I could abide.</i>

39:18.930 --> 39:22.470
<i>I ran out, hoping what I had seen
was only in my mind,</i>

39:22.520 --> 39:25.600
<i>a demonic vision
driven by lack of glucose.</i>

39:30.770 --> 39:35.190
<i>But somehow, I knew that it was true
and that something terrible had happened.</i>

39:51.540 --> 39:52.800
Anyone home?

39:54.880 --> 39:56.510
Enz, hey.

39:56.550 --> 39:58.220
What are you doing? Come here.

39:59.640 --> 40:00.890
Enzo, come here!

40:04.470 --> 40:06.140
Come here, bud. Hey.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.610
What happened?

40:12.980 --> 40:14.150
Where is everyone?

40:15.240 --> 40:16.240
Eve?

40:18.240 --> 40:19.860
Are Eve and Zoë still there?

40:20.570 --> 40:21.740
Can I talk to her?

40:25.250 --> 40:27.830
Yeah. I'm at the house. Enzo is here.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.130
Wait, Eve-- wait, hold--

40:32.170 --> 40:34.000
He's been here the whole time?

40:34.300 --> 40:36.050
I thought you took him with you!

40:36.510 --> 40:38.970
No, I got to go.
I got to take care of him.

40:41.430 --> 40:43.600
The mat was the only place you used, huh?

40:44.260 --> 40:45.390
Come here, bud.

40:46.020 --> 40:47.020
There you go.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.190
-Daddy, I missed you!
-Oh! I missed you, too.

40:53.570 --> 40:54.820
Can I say hi to my animals?

40:54.860 --> 40:56.030
-Sure, sweetheart.
-Yeah, go up.

40:57.070 --> 40:58.610
I'm just trying to understand.

40:59.450 --> 41:02.070
I felt so sick I wasn't thinking.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.910
The doctor thinks
it's maybe something viral.

41:05.700 --> 41:07.620
Hi, buddy. Hi.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.870
Enz, I'm so sorry.

41:09.910 --> 41:11.420
I'm so sorry.

41:12.290 --> 41:13.330
Zoë?

41:13.380 --> 41:15.550
Something happened to my animals!

41:20.130 --> 41:23.010
This is a mess.
I don't understand why he'd do this.

41:23.050 --> 41:24.140
Zoë, stop crying.

41:24.390 --> 41:25.810
I'm gonna go find him.

41:27.270 --> 41:28.180
Get over here.

41:28.890 --> 41:30.350
Get over here!

41:30.390 --> 41:32.150
Bad dog! Come on!

41:32.560 --> 41:34.560
Look what you did.
Look what you did!

41:34.900 --> 41:37.070
You see that?
Why would you do that?

41:38.110 --> 41:39.440
Bad dog!

41:39.490 --> 41:41.740
-You stupid dog!
-Denny, stop!

41:41.780 --> 41:42.990
What are you doing?

41:46.080 --> 41:47.700
<i>I had only one thought.</i>

41:48.290 --> 41:50.210
<i>The zebra must have reassembled itself</i>

41:50.250 --> 41:52.960
<i>and attacked the remaining
animals after I left.</i>

41:53.830 --> 41:56.840
<i>I should've destroyed the demon
when I had the chance.</i>

41:57.340 --> 41:59.550
<i>I should've eaten it,
even if it killed me.</i>

42:19.860 --> 42:21.280
I'm so sorry, Enz.

42:23.110 --> 42:24.740
I promise I'll never do that again.

42:26.950 --> 42:28.370
You're a tough old dog.

42:32.580 --> 42:33.830
Come on.

42:33.870 --> 42:34.870
Come on.

42:40.130 --> 42:41.590
I won, by the way.

42:42.220 --> 42:43.840
Like first in class?

42:44.300 --> 42:45.390
First overall.

42:46.090 --> 42:48.260
Plus, a permanent seat
in the Apex prototype.

42:48.300 --> 42:50.350
Oh, my God, Denny! Oh, my God!

42:50.390 --> 42:51.680
They want me down in Sonoma

42:51.720 --> 42:53.180
to start training
with the team right away.

42:53.230 --> 42:54.640
I'm so proud of you.

42:54.890 --> 42:56.400
I was thinking
we could all go on the road?

42:56.730 --> 42:58.480
-Yes.
-Maybe at least for the summer?

42:58.520 --> 43:00.440
Yeah, go to all the races and everything?

43:01.990 --> 43:04.490
<i>In racing, your car goes
where your eyes go.</i>

43:05.240 --> 43:07.370
<i>A driver who cannot tear
his gaze from the wall</i>

43:07.410 --> 43:09.660
<i>will inevitably meet that wall.</i>

43:10.200 --> 43:13.960
<i>But the driver who looks down the track
as he feels his tires break free,</i>

43:14.290 --> 43:17.750
<i>that driver will maintain control
of his car and his destiny.</i>

43:18.330 --> 43:20.840
<i>I realized this was what Denny had done.</i>

43:21.340 --> 43:22.840
<i>He had manifested a win</i>

43:23.260 --> 43:24.840
<i>because he knew we needed one.</i>

43:28.600 --> 43:29.680
Keys.

43:31.510 --> 43:34.230
-Okay. I'll call you tonight.
-Okay.

43:34.270 --> 43:36.140
Bye, bud. Hey, kiddo, I need that.

43:37.020 --> 43:38.020
Let's see.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.070
Thank you. Thank you.

43:42.070 --> 43:43.320
-Have fun.
-Bye.

43:43.360 --> 43:44.280
Bye, Daddy!

43:53.700 --> 43:54.950
-Hi, Mom.
<i>-Hi.</i>

43:55.000 --> 43:56.410
<i>I wanted to see how you're feeling.</i>

43:56.460 --> 43:58.170
I'm fine. Much better.

43:58.210 --> 44:00.420
I'm taking Enzo for a hike
while Zoë's at school.

44:00.460 --> 44:02.460
I need to get into shape, I feel so gross.

44:02.960 --> 44:05.010
<i>Honey, you're frail as a whippet.</i>

44:05.720 --> 44:07.380
<i>Is Denny out of town again?</i>

44:07.430 --> 44:10.140
Mom, I'm not getting into this.
I hear enough about it from Dad.

44:10.180 --> 44:12.260
<i>Sweetheart, I'm really just asking.</i>

44:12.310 --> 44:13.180
I know.

44:14.310 --> 44:16.230
I got to go.
I'll call you later. I love you.

44:16.480 --> 44:18.100
<i>-I love you.
</i>-Bye.

44:49.970 --> 44:50.890
It's okay.

44:52.260 --> 44:53.430
I'm okay.

45:33.850 --> 45:36.060
<i>There are moments
when the urge to speak</i>

45:36.100 --> 45:37.020
<i>is truly maddening.</i>

45:50.150 --> 45:51.490
There's a number.

45:54.410 --> 45:56.490
<i>Sometimes I hate what I am.</i>

46:12.180 --> 46:13.470
Hey, come on.

46:16.720 --> 46:17.720
Come here.

46:21.520 --> 46:23.230
Yeah... she's gonna be okay.

46:27.190 --> 46:29.440
-Appreciate this, Mike.
-No problem, man.

46:30.110 --> 46:32.320
They're talking about
not even doing a biopsy,

46:32.650 --> 46:35.110
just go in and get it... malignant or not.

46:36.700 --> 46:37.620
You...

46:38.030 --> 46:39.790
You want me to call Apex for you?

46:40.040 --> 46:41.160
Nah, I already did.

46:41.580 --> 46:43.750
Told them I'm out
for the season, maybe longer.

46:45.880 --> 46:47.170
I have to be here.

46:48.960 --> 46:51.550
Okay, Enzo, you're gonna bunk
with Uncle Mike tonight.

46:51.590 --> 46:52.760
What do you say about that?

46:52.800 --> 46:54.220
You be good for Mike, okay?

46:55.220 --> 46:56.720
See you in a couple days.

46:58.970 --> 47:01.350
<i>I would have done
anything to stay with him.</i>

47:02.390 --> 47:03.560
<i>But being a dog,</i>

47:03.600 --> 47:05.520
<i>I was not allowed into the hospital</i>

47:05.560 --> 47:08.610
<i>to hear the diagnosis
or the options being discussed.</i>

47:09.400 --> 47:11.320
<i>I was almost ten years old</i>

47:11.900 --> 47:14.030
<i>but no one confided in me,</i>

47:14.070 --> 47:17.070
<i>or expected anything except
that I control my barking</i>

47:17.120 --> 47:19.370
<i>and do my business outside.</i>

47:20.490 --> 47:22.620
<i>Somewhere the zebra was dancing.</i>

47:24.830 --> 47:26.330
<i>I thought about escaping.</i>

47:27.170 --> 47:28.750
<i>I wanted to push everyone away</i>

47:28.790 --> 47:32.760
<i>and run off to live with my ancestors
on the high desert plains of Mongolia.</i>

47:37.550 --> 47:40.350
<i>I might have, too,
if not for my absolute faith</i>

47:40.390 --> 47:42.680
<i>in Denny's ability
to make things right again.</i>

47:50.570 --> 47:51.730
She's out of surgery.

47:52.230 --> 47:53.610
Now we just wait and...

47:53.900 --> 47:55.360
see how she responds.

47:57.860 --> 47:58.990
Hey, pal.

47:59.030 --> 48:01.080
<i>A transmission gear snaps.</i>

48:01.120 --> 48:02.580
<i>The clutch fails.</i>

48:02.620 --> 48:04.620
<i>Brakes go soft from overheating.</i>

48:06.460 --> 48:08.290
<i>The poor driver will crash.</i>

48:08.710 --> 48:10.590
<i>The average driver will quit.</i>

48:10.960 --> 48:13.250
<i>But the great driver
will drive through the problem.</i>

48:13.300 --> 48:14.260
Hey, listen.

48:15.510 --> 48:17.630
I have to teach tomorrow,

48:17.680 --> 48:19.430
so you're gonna go to
Caroline's house after school

48:19.470 --> 48:21.140
and I'll pick you up at six.

48:22.220 --> 48:23.100
Okay.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.470
Okay.

48:26.520 --> 48:27.600
Daddy?

48:28.390 --> 48:29.400
Yeah.

48:31.730 --> 48:33.480
When's Mommy gonna come home?

48:35.990 --> 48:37.200
I don't know, pal.

48:38.740 --> 48:40.070
Soon, I hope.

48:40.530 --> 48:43.280
<i>The great driver finds
a way to keep racing.</i>

48:44.080 --> 48:45.200
Good night, Daddy.

48:45.750 --> 48:47.330
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

49:03.430 --> 49:05.140
What's the matter?
You like grilled cheese.

49:05.180 --> 49:07.140
But it's gonna be cold by lunchtime.

49:07.180 --> 49:08.640
Give your dad a break.

49:08.690 --> 49:11.190
I'm kinda learning
on the job here, kiddo.

49:11.230 --> 49:12.520
Your wife works too, huh?

49:12.940 --> 49:15.360
My mommy's in the hospital.
Her brain got sick.

49:16.860 --> 49:19.030
Okay, so I'm gonna pick you up
right after school.

49:19.320 --> 49:21.530
But today's Tuesday.
I have an extended day.

49:21.780 --> 49:23.120
Okay, so what time is that over?

49:23.160 --> 49:24.830
Ask Mommy. She knows.

49:26.370 --> 49:27.750
-Bye, sweetheart.
-Bye.

49:29.370 --> 49:30.500
Hi, Mommy.

49:30.540 --> 49:31.960
<i>Days became weeks,</i>

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
<i>and still Eve did not come
home from the hospital.</i>

49:35.040 --> 49:36.380
You're gonna be okay.

49:37.340 --> 49:39.380
Everything's gonna be okay.

49:41.050 --> 49:42.840
Maybe you should sit down now.

49:53.690 --> 49:57.110
<i>The people who cared about Denny
made special accommodations.</i>

49:57.570 --> 49:59.990
<i>Mike got him some part-time
work at the garage</i>

50:00.030 --> 50:02.570
<i>and looked after me whenever Denny asked.</i>

50:04.620 --> 50:06.660
<i>And there were other skills
he was forced to master.</i>

50:06.700 --> 50:08.410
-You're hurting me!
-Okay.

50:08.830 --> 50:09.750
I'm sorry.

50:09.790 --> 50:13.500
<i>Zoë spent the hot summer days
at a kids' camp over by Green Lake...</i>

50:15.460 --> 50:16.670
Hi, sweetheart.

50:16.710 --> 50:18.960
<i>...and the occasional night
with the twins.</i>

50:19.010 --> 50:20.170
Bye!

50:21.720 --> 50:22.840
Here we go.

50:26.010 --> 50:27.060
<i>On those nights,</i>

50:27.100 --> 50:29.600
<i>Denny would stay late
at the hospital with Eve.</i>

50:31.350 --> 50:34.020
<i>When we'd come home,
he would be very quiet.</i>

50:45.240 --> 50:48.370
<i>And then it would fall to me
to provide what he needed.</i>

51:10.850 --> 51:12.770
<i>By autumn,
we'd come to resemble</i>

51:12.810 --> 51:14.730
<i>something like a seasoned pit crew.</i>

51:15.980 --> 51:19.070
<i>Anticipating, adjusting, correcting.</i>

51:19.400 --> 51:21.690
Wait, sweetheart, here.
Here's your lunch.

51:21.730 --> 51:23.360
-Thanks, Daddy.
-Okay, see you later.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.320
-Bye.
-Bye.

51:24.610 --> 51:25.780
Bye, Enzo.

51:26.360 --> 51:27.370
Bye.

51:29.620 --> 51:31.040
What do you say, Enz?

51:31.330 --> 51:32.620
You're gonna like this one. You ready?

51:33.710 --> 51:35.210
Hey, Zoë!

51:35.920 --> 51:36.920
Dinner!

51:38.500 --> 51:40.420
<i>Benjamin is going around the outside,</i>

51:40.460 --> 51:42.010
<i>and it's Wilson and Neal.</i>

51:42.670 --> 51:44.590
No fair. It's the red car's fault!

51:44.630 --> 51:46.130
Well, yes and no.

51:46.180 --> 51:48.680
See, you've got to be in charge
of your position on the track.

51:48.720 --> 51:50.140
That's what the red car was doing.

51:53.560 --> 51:55.770
At some point, in every race

51:56.480 --> 51:58.940
you got to take a risk if you want to win.

51:59.560 --> 52:01.520
"Slow hands in the fast stuff,

52:01.570 --> 52:03.650
fast hands in the slow stuff."

52:03.900 --> 52:05.400
Oh, my God!

52:05.450 --> 52:07.240
Your mom is gonna kill me.

52:07.610 --> 52:09.530
<i>That night, Denny got the call.</i>

52:10.240 --> 52:13.080
<i>The doctors were finally allowing Eve
to come home,</i>

52:13.410 --> 52:15.870
<i>only she wouldn't be coming home to us.</i>

52:16.410 --> 52:18.330
Why can't Mommy stay with us?

52:18.580 --> 52:20.080
Well, she will soon.

52:20.380 --> 52:22.500
But we thought since
your grandparents are home all the time,

52:22.550 --> 52:24.260
it'd be best if she just stayed with them.

52:24.550 --> 52:25.550
Just for now.

52:34.810 --> 52:36.140
Mommy's here!

52:44.030 --> 52:46.030
-Oh, Zoë--
-That's fine, Mom.

52:46.990 --> 52:47.990
My baby.

52:48.400 --> 52:49.700
I've been waiting for this.

52:49.740 --> 52:50.870
Me, too.

52:54.450 --> 52:55.790
It's still her, boy.

53:05.760 --> 53:07.340
"And it was snowing on a squirrel,

53:07.380 --> 53:09.510
it was snowing on a beaver

53:09.550 --> 53:11.430
and it was snowing on everyone.

53:12.140 --> 53:13.470
But then he said,

53:13.510 --> 53:15.970
'Oh, look, just as we thought.'

53:16.220 --> 53:18.730
And Boggan said, 'Wish!'

53:19.140 --> 53:21.980
Charles wrote his wish
on a piece of paper."

53:22.310 --> 53:24.770
I don't understand.
What exactly are you asking?

53:24.820 --> 53:27.150
Maxwell and I think Zoë
should stay here with us.

53:27.190 --> 53:28.320
At least until...

53:30.070 --> 53:31.200
Until what?

53:31.240 --> 53:34.030
Are we just assuming now
that she's not gonna make it?

53:34.080 --> 53:35.410
We're all praying for the best,

53:35.450 --> 53:37.160
but you heard what her doctor said.

53:37.910 --> 53:40.080
This might be the only time Zoë has
with her mother.

53:40.670 --> 53:42.040
I can drive her to and from school.

53:42.460 --> 53:43.380
Or you can.

53:43.840 --> 53:45.250
Whatever you want.

53:46.210 --> 53:47.880
And you're welcome to stay here, too.

53:47.920 --> 53:49.510
We just didn't think that you--

53:50.680 --> 53:52.010
It's really up to you.

53:54.760 --> 53:56.060
I'll talk about it with Eve.

53:59.680 --> 54:00.690
Come on.

54:03.100 --> 54:05.020
They just want to help us, Denny.

54:05.940 --> 54:07.030
I know.

54:08.110 --> 54:09.780
What matters is what you want.

54:13.660 --> 54:15.330
I want my old life back.

54:20.330 --> 54:23.000
Has my dad been any better with you?
He promised he would be.

54:23.040 --> 54:25.670
Yeah, he's fine.
We're fine, really. You just...

54:26.630 --> 54:29.050
You just keep focused on you. Okay?

54:30.800 --> 54:34.090
Knock wood, in a few weeks
I'll get some strength back

54:34.140 --> 54:35.760
and we can both come home again.

54:36.970 --> 54:37.970
Right?

54:38.470 --> 54:39.470
Right.

54:43.140 --> 54:44.980
I want you to start racing again.

54:46.150 --> 54:48.150
You've been away from it for too long.

54:49.150 --> 54:50.150
We'll see.

54:52.700 --> 54:54.700
I can't be the reason that you quit.

54:56.660 --> 54:58.790
You promised me that you wouldn't quit.

55:00.750 --> 55:01.750
I won't.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.080
I won't.

55:09.500 --> 55:10.840
Get some sleep...

55:11.920 --> 55:12.920
okay?

55:16.090 --> 55:17.180
I love you.

55:18.930 --> 55:20.770
I love you so much.

55:29.610 --> 55:32.360
<i>It must be so difficult
being a person.</i>

55:33.530 --> 55:36.780
<i>Sometimes I doubt my ability
to interact on such a level,</i>

55:36.820 --> 55:40.540
<i>but I know it's required
if I'm to become the human I hope to be.</i>

55:44.580 --> 55:46.250
Take care of our girls, Enzo.

55:52.710 --> 55:56.340
<i>I stayed awake all that night
and many others that followed.</i>

55:57.800 --> 55:59.550
<i>The demon was coming for Eve.</i>

55:59.800 --> 56:02.020
<i>But he would have to get through me first.</i>

56:03.730 --> 56:07.560
<i>Only once the others awoke
did I dare relinquish my guard duties.</i>

56:08.190 --> 56:09.230
Lazy dog.

56:12.650 --> 56:15.110
<i>On some nights,
Denny kept watch with me.</i>

56:18.570 --> 56:20.740
<i>But he couldn't rest in the morning.</i>

56:22.040 --> 56:23.950
-I got it, I got it. Okay.
<i>-He had to stay strong for Zoë.</i>

56:24.410 --> 56:25.910
Tug-o-war. What about this one?

56:29.420 --> 56:30.920
We've got a tug-o-war.

56:32.460 --> 56:34.420
Which one's he gonna get?
Which one's he gonna get?

56:39.300 --> 56:41.260
Here it goes! I got it. It's over there!

56:41.800 --> 56:42.810
Enz, come here.

56:44.470 --> 56:45.730
Good boy.

56:53.780 --> 56:55.610
-Remember?
-Yeah.

56:56.860 --> 56:58.950
<i>His endurance knew no limits.</i>

57:00.410 --> 57:01.700
Hey...

57:01.740 --> 57:03.030
-a tennis racket.
-Yeah!

57:03.280 --> 57:05.370
And Grandpa got you
lessons at our club

57:05.410 --> 57:07.710
on Wednesday afternoons.
Won't that be fun?

57:07.960 --> 57:10.120
Actually, Wednesday's
not that good for me.

57:10.170 --> 57:11.460
I'm at the garage all day.

57:11.500 --> 57:13.420
That's all right.
We can drive you, Zoë, right?

57:13.460 --> 57:14.340
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

57:14.750 --> 57:17.840
<i>And when Eve's parents
doted on Zoë, he let them.</i>

57:17.880 --> 57:19.470
<i>He understood this was their way</i>

57:19.510 --> 57:22.260
<i>of pushing out of their minds
what was happening to their own daughter.</i>

57:27.520 --> 57:29.810
<i>A task that was, of course,
impossible.</i>

57:43.490 --> 57:45.410
Hey, I'm back. Where are you guys?

57:57.260 --> 57:59.340
-Hi.
-Surprise!

58:00.340 --> 58:01.760
What's the surprise?

58:02.090 --> 58:03.970
-Just come.
-We decided to have a party.

58:04.010 --> 58:05.560
We're having a party?

58:05.970 --> 58:08.020
I think I'm a little underdressed.

58:08.350 --> 58:10.180
You look incredibly handsome.

58:11.190 --> 58:12.690
Are you sure you're up for this?

58:14.110 --> 58:15.520
I want to come home.

58:16.940 --> 58:18.150
I want you home...

58:19.360 --> 58:21.150
so bad, you have no idea.

59:33.940 --> 59:35.190
Do you see?

59:37.520 --> 59:38.610
Do you?

59:40.940 --> 59:42.940
I'm not afraid of it anymore.

59:45.950 --> 59:47.990
Because I know it's not the end.

59:52.620 --> 59:54.370
But you knew that, didn't you?

59:57.710 --> 59:59.000
You know everything.

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:06.720
<i>Not everything, no.</i>

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.070
<i>Eve's last breath freed her soul.</i>

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.950
<i>I saw it leave myself.</i>

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.250
<i>Released to continue
its journey elsewhere.</i>

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.180
That's nice.

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.830
That's a baby game.

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:25.880
I have to be a grownup now.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.700
Trish just fixed Zoë something to eat.

01:03:57.450 --> 01:03:58.450
Thank you.

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:04.750
All those people.

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:08.630
All her old friends.

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:11.550
Students of hers.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.210
Yeah, everyone loved her.

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.470
I thought I'd be ready, you know?

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:21.140
I mean, I knew it was coming, but...

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:23.060
I wasn't ready.

01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:24.850
Not at all.

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:28.060
Well, to be honest, Denny, that's...

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:31.020
what's concerning us a little.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.360
That you haven't made any preparations.

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.400
You don't seem to have a plan in place.

01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:36.990
Plan? I don't...

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:40.240
Zoë's eating an egg and some toast.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.740
We just started.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:43.870
Oh, I thought...

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.830
I'm sorry, started what?

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.170
Can one of you tell me
what exactly is going on here?

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:01.140
Maxwell and I have been talking, and...

01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:03.810
we were wondering if maybe

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:06.390
the best situation for all of us involved

01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:10.060
might be if Zoë continued
to live here with us.

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:13.020
What?

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:14.980
She needs stability right now.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.150
And, frankly, we don't think
you're in a position to provide that.

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:21.620
-Not if you're gonna return to racing.
-Are you gonna go back to racing?

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:23.870
Of course, yeah.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.540
Not right away, but...

01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:27.750
And when you do,
who's gonna take care of Zoë then?

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:29.420
I will.

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.420
-Like you did Eve?
-Maxwell!

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.670
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:36.420
Denny, please, none of us has the heart
to argue about this right now.

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.970
Maybe if you'd been around more,
you'd have noticed something was wrong.

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.510
-Maybe it could've been caught in time.
-That's not true!

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:43.010
He's upset, Denny, he's just upset.

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:46.430
You don't think that I asked the doctors
that question a thousand times?

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:48.980
We all know there's nothing
anybody could've done.

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.520
That's not what this is about.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.570
Zoë is coming home with me.
End of discussion!

01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:55.940
We just want to consider
what's best for Zoë.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:59.070
What's best for Zoë
is that she is with her father.

01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:01.110
And if you want to have
any relationship with her,

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.450
I suggest you stop pushing
this issue right now!

01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:04.620
See, what'd I tell you?

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.080
But you could still be in her life,

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.950
just as much as you want to.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.080
We have the time and the money
to care for her

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.540
the way Eve would have wanted.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.540
You can continue to pursue
your racing full-time.

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:16.800
I'm done. I'm done listening to this.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.760
You're giving us no other choice.

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:21.550
Maxwell, you promised me you wouldn't!

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:27.220
Are you kidding me?

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.890
I just buried my wife

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.810
and you're suing me
for custody of my daughter?

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.570
Denny, I'm so sorry.
This is not at all what we thought--

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.280
Finished my egg.

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.280
Sweetheart, go inside
and pack your things.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.570
We're gonna go home right now.

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:43.620
Everything's fine, honey.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:46.240
Your dad has some things to take care of,
so you'll stay with us for now.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.330
Zoë, go and get your stuff. We're leaving.

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.250
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:52.920
You can't do this alone and you know it.

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:55.130
What happens when
you're back to disappearing

01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:58.210
for days on end at those races of yours?

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:00.090
You're on a plane every weekend.

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:02.680
You missed her birth, for Christ sakes!

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.050
You're not taking her.

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.800
Oh, my God.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.100
-Are you--
-I'm fine.

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.520
I said I'm fine!

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.600
Denny, please let her stay.

01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:14.650
Just for now.

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:16.310
The lawyers could come up
with a compromise!

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.320
Zoë!

01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:21.650
We'll come back later
for your dolls, okay?

01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:22.700
Okay.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.750
Get in the car, sweetheart.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.670
You're making a big mistake!

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:38.250
Enzo, get in.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.190
Not now, Enzo.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.450
What? Okay.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.250
<i>I didn't know what was on.</i>

01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:21.460
<i>I only knew he needed a distraction.</i>

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.010
<i>It was something Eve used to do
when Denny was down.</i>

01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:27.760
Okay, you crazy dog.

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.520
<i>It turned out to be
the 1989 Luxembourg Grand Prix</i>

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.310
<i>in which the Irish driver
Kevin Finnerty York</i>

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.270
<i>finished victorious
while driving the final 20 laps</i>

01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:40.859
<i>with only two gears.</i>

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:49.700
<i>A true champion can accomplish things
a normal person would consider impossible.</i>

01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:53.370
<i>Denny just needed to remember that.</i>

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:58.330
Thanks for taking
my call at home, Mark.

01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:59.830
You're the only lawyer that I know.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.500
And you're the only mechanic I trust.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.170
Relax, Denny.

01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:07.420
From what you told me on the phone,
this is open-and-shut.

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:09.760
-Where is your daughter now?
-She wanted to go to school.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.260
-Should I have kept her at home?
-No, that's good.

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.430
You're responding to her needs.

01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:16.390
They're trying to claim
you're an unfit parent

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.899
because of the intrinsic
dangers of your occupation.

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:20.979
It's a totally bogus suit.

01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:23.689
Can't imagine
why they even bothered to file it.

01:09:23.729 --> 01:09:26.439
I'll demand a summary judgment
and that'll be that.

01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:29.279
-You're saying there's not even a chance.
-This is Washington State.

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:31.660
The child is always awarded
to the biological parent.

01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:33.370
No question.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.840
-Afternoon, Officers.
-You Dennis Swift?

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.510
I'll just check if he's still in the back.

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.510
I'm Denny Swift.

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:53.970
Would you step out
from behind the counter, sir?

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.600
Okay.

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.770
We have a warrant for your arrest.

01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:00.350
This some kind of joke?

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.400
Sir, place your hands on the counter
and spread your legs.

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.400
Okay.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.650
Hey, buddy, it's okay.

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:07.280
Can you tell me
how long this will take?

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.780
You have the right to remain silent...

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.860
I need to pick my daughter
up from school.

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.200
-Denny, I can pick her up for you.
-No, call Mark Finn.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.830
-He'll know what to do.
-Do you understand your rights?

01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:16.200
-Yeah, I understand.
-This way, please.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.330
Call Mark Finn.

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:18.450
Stay.

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:19.910
What are you arresting him for?

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.250
<i>I'd only felt
such helplessness once before.</i>

01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:26.960
<i>The day Eve collapsed in the woods.</i>

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.140
Coffee tomorrow morning, 8:30 sharp.

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:35.350
-We'll go over everything then, all right?
-All right.

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.140
We tried picking Zoë up from school, but--

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.190
I know, her grandparents got to her first.

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:43.310
They timed this thing on purpose, man.

01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:44.900
Come on.

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:46.980
Thanks, Mike.

01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:52.410
Fourth-degree assault
is a gross misdemeanor,

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:55.160
so it's unlikely
you'll see any real jail time.

01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:57.870
But we both know
that's not what this is about.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.460
There's almost no chance
you'll be awarded custody

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.710
if you're convicted.

01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:04.670
Now, because of the criminal charges,

01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:07.210
the judge granted
a temporary restraining order.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:09.510
That means you're looking at 90 days
before you can see Zoë again.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:10.970
No.

01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:12.510
No, I can't not see--

01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:13.800
You're gonna have to.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.930
Eve's parents already filed a motion
to terminate your rights.

01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:19.180
Mark, this is crazy. He grabbed me.

01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:20.520
Any witnesses?

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.020
Trish, I guess, but her back was to us.

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.270
I can talk to her.

01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:27.690
No, do not speak to either of them,
I mean it.

01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.690
You'll jeopardize your entire case.

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:32.990
Now, to explain your absence to Zoë

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:36.660
we have agreed to invent a story
about you driving for a team in Europe.

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:39.540
I also managed to negotiate
a letter exchange.

01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:41.620
Ninety days!

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.370
<i>The injustice was unbearable.</i>

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:46.670
<i>First, Denny lost Eve,</i>

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:49.050
<i>and now he would be deprived of Zoë, too.</i>

01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:00.060
<i>Denny struggled as the weeks passed.</i>

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:10.900
<i>While I very much wish to be human,</i>

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.820
<i>there is one advantage to being a dog
that I will miss.</i>

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:17.200
What do you think, Enz?

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:25.290
<i>A dog can power down his psyche
and slow his metabolism.</i>

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:29.040
<i>He can sit for hours on end
with no effort.</i>

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:32.550
<i>A dog can change the tempo of the world,</i>

01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:33.970
<i>but people are at its mercy.</i>

01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:44.480
Hello?

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.270
<i>What's the deal with the dog?</i>

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:47.980
<i>The dog.</i>

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:50.320
<i>Zoë's been asking her grandparents
to see the dog.</i>

01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:52.730
Of course she can see Enzo.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.740
Tell her he's been staying at Mike's

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:57.320
and I can have Mike
drop Enzo off this weekend.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.240
<i>-Okay. I'll float it.
</i>-Okay.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.410
Thanks, Mark.

01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:03.540
<i>Listen, my secretary says
we sent you an invoice.</i>

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:06.250
Yeah, I paid that.

01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:07.620
<i>That was your prior invoice.</i>

01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:10.750
<i>I realize you can't leave the state,
so racing is not an option.</i>

01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:13.500
<i>But I have people working on this,
paralegals, support staff.</i>

01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:15.010
Yeah, I know, Mark. I'll...

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:17.130
find a way to pay you.

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:29.060
<i>It was hard to comprehend
this turn our lives had taken.</i>

01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.950
Enzo!

01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:40.530
Come here, Enz!

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.290
Make sure you wipe his paws off
before he comes in.

01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:49.420
-Grandma just had the carpets cleaned.
-Okay.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.000
<i>Hey, little Enzo
So nice to see you...</i>

01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:58.970
I miss Daddy. Don't you?

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.140
<i>For the first time in my life,
I was glad I couldn't talk.</i>

01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:07.180
<i>I wouldn't know what to tell her.</i>

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.900
<i>After Zoë went to sleep,</i>

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:17.030
<i>I took the opportunity
to spy on the twins.</i>

01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:18.570
The man put me on the ground.

01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:21.450
I cracked a rib, for God's sake.

01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:23.370
You saw what happened!

01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:28.910
The lawyer said the whole case hinges
on you corroborating my statement.

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:31.330
You need to testify.

01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:34.630
<i>Inside me a darkness was brewing.</i>

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.840
Just remember
who we're doing this for, okay?

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:39.010
Our granddaughter.
That's all that matters.

01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:44.300
<i>And I was not above
using the tools of my dogness</i>

01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:45.810
<i>to exact justice.</i>

01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:47.470
What?

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:50.520
You like pepper?

01:14:50.890 --> 01:14:52.230
Maxwell.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.150
<i>I knew that pepper
was bad for me,</i>

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.270
<i>but I ate it anyway.</i>

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.450
Good, huh?

01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:03.870
<i>After all, I'm just a stupid dog.</i>

01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:07.450
<i>It's the second longest bull market
we've ever seen.</i>

01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:09.410
<i>Potential sellers have not bailed out.</i>

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.250
<i>I watched and I waited...</i>

01:15:13.670 --> 01:15:17.250
<i>...as in my stomach
a foul concoction steeped.</i>

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:29.640
Come on.
We got to go outside, come on.

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.150
Come on. Let's go,
let's get busy, come on!

01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:39.150
Come on, let's go, let's get busy.

01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:41.150
Oh, no, no. No!

01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:42.990
No, no, no, no!

01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:45.110
Trish! Get down here!

01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:48.030
The dog just took a liquid dump
on the carpet!

01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:49.870
Where's the bucket?

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:51.660
God.

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.330
Trish! Can you get down here?

01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:56.380
<i>You get busy, mister.</i>

01:15:57.590 --> 01:16:00.340
Your eyes are already forward,
looking at that next turn.

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.050
-Give me a second, okay?
-Sure.

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.970
What happened? I thought
they were keeping him until tonight.

01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:06.010
Yeah...

01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:09.220
From what I understand,
Enzo wasn't exactly the ideal houseguest.

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:10.770
Okay. Well, we're almost finished up here.

01:16:11.890 --> 01:16:15.020
<i>It'd been years since these old eyes
had seen a live track.</i>

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.650
<i>I didn't realize
just how much I'd missed it.</i>

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.650
<i>I even felt the tug of my old dream</i>

01:16:20.690 --> 01:16:23.070
<i>of driving in a real racecar
alongside him.</i>

01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:24.450
All right,
let's checker the session,

01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:25.530
clear the track!

01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:27.120
All the students to the grandstand.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.450
Nobody head home yet.

01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:30.200
Hey, Denny, got a minute?

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.200
Give me a second.

01:16:32.330 --> 01:16:33.330
Luca!

01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.160
Don, how are you? Good to see you.

01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:36.330
Good to see you.

01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:38.040
This is Luca Pantoni from Ferrari.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.500
He's visiting us from Italy.

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.460
-Denny Swift.
-Pleasure.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.590
Is this the new model?

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:43.970
Yeah, direct from the factory.

01:16:44.010 --> 01:16:45.510
It's even better-looking in person.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.180
You know, I saw you race once. In Daytona.

01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:50.310
Yeah, that was a tough one.

01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:52.100
Luca was hoping
you could show him the track.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.480
Yes, sir.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.730
Who is that?

01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:02.730
Head of driver development
from Ferrari in Italy.

01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:09.450
I figure it'll take him a lap
to get comfortable,

01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:11.330
but next time by it'll be a flyer.

01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.080
Come on. Follow me.

01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:15.910
-Come on, Enz.
-Up here, guys. Bring it in.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.080
Now watch. You're getting
a master class here.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.840
That said, any of you
ever drive like that,

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:30.090
I will black flag you
so fast your head'll spin.

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:31.180
Denny's a professional.

01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.670
How was it?

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.420
-That was incredible.
-Ha!

01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:02.920
You deserve it.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.130
-All right, show's over!
-What'd you think, huh, boy?

01:18:05.170 --> 01:18:06.590
See everybody tomorrow!

01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:08.510
You're a Ferrari guy. Isn't she a beaut?

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.510
I would like to offer you a job.

01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:13.220
I work in Maranello,

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:15.180
the factory headquarters,

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:17.140
and we have a wonderful track there.

01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:19.520
You'd be testing the cars.

01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:24.610
Thank you, Mr. Pantoni, but...

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:28.030
there are certain things

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:30.910
that keep me from leaving
the country right now.

01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:33.240
Don explained to me
all about your troubles.

01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:36.120
But if your situation should change,

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:38.120
my phone is on the card.

01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:41.000
It was a pleasure.

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.500
Thank you, sir.

01:18:43.710 --> 01:18:44.710
Come on.

01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:58.930
He's asked about you over the years.

01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:00.940
When I told him what you
went through with Eve,

01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:02.810
he said he wanted to hire you.

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:06.820
All I know is, he respects
how you're fighting for your daughter.

01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:12.450
And what if I don't win?

01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:14.700
There's no dishonor
in losing the race,

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.660
there's only dishonor in not racing
because you're afraid to lose.

01:19:18.910 --> 01:19:20.710
Now go find your students,
get back on the track.

01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:21.710
That's where you belong.

01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:25.420
Come on.

01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:32.260
<i>Ninety days seemed
an eternity, even for me.</i>

01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.930
<i>But at long last, day 90 arrived.</i>

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:42.440
-Hey.
-Daddy!

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:46.020
Hi.

01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:47.650
Enzo!

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.490
I'll be back for her by six.

01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:52.900
Okay.

01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:54.280
-Take care.
-Thanks.

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.500
-Missed you.
-Missed you.

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:04.750
Come on. I made something
special for dinner.

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.460
Daddy?

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.720
Are you gonna go back to Europe soon?

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.640
-No, not yet, sweetheart.
-Yay.

01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.890
But, Zo, you need to stay
with your grandparents

01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:21.600
for just a little while longer, okay?

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.140
No, I want to come home.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.640
I know you do.

01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:26.850
And I want you to
more than anything, but...

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:29.940
the lawyers still need to make a decision
about where it's best for you to live.

01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:33.570
Okay? That's just part of what happens
when someone's mommy dies.

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:36.780
Just tell them. Tell them I want to live
back home with you and Enzo.

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.410
Okay.

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.240
I'll tell them.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.580
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye, baby.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.210
You'll get her every other
weekend until the trial.

01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:50.750
After that...

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:51.880
It's all or nothing.

01:20:54.670 --> 01:20:56.300
Look, Denny...

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.850
I know this isn't what you
want to hear right now...

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:01.760
but their attorney made it clear to me.

01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:03.850
The suit, the criminal charges,

01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:05.560
it can all go away tomorrow,

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.480
if you dropped your custody claim to Zoë.

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:12.230
Now, I have an obligation to make sure
you understand-- we have leverage now.

01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:15.070
I'm talking visitation, privileges,

01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:17.160
things we're gonna have
a much harder time securing

01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:19.370
if you're found guilty of assault

01:21:19.410 --> 01:21:21.490
and Zoë's grandparents
are awarded custody.

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.120
Leverage.

01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:26.920
I'm not saying we can't win.

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.630
We might.

01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:31.170
But we could also lose. Big.

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:32.880
Can't lose, Mark.

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:34.590
Denny, anyone can lose.

01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:36.010
You, of all people, should know that.

01:21:38.050 --> 01:21:39.050
Look, just...

01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:40.850
just give it some thought.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.190
<i>I knew what Denny was thinking.</i>

01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:55.360
<i>If he just had
a steering wheel to hold onto,</i>

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.950
<i>his hands wouldn't shake.</i>

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.540
<i>"Just you and me, Enzo."</i>

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:09.830
<i>That's what he'd always say
when we'd take our night runs.</i>

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.710
Come on, Enz! Let's go.

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:13.170
<i>But not that night.</i>

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:15.920
<i>We were together, but alone.</i>

01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:23.560
<i>I began to devise a plan.</i>

01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:26.220
<i>We'd drive to Zoë's school one day,</i>

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:29.440
<i>pick her up unannounced,
and then head straight for Montreal,</i>

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.440
<i>where they host a Grand Prix every summer.</i>

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:37.900
Enz?

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.910
Enzo, stay where you are!
Enzo, no!

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.370
Oh, God!

01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:50.000
-I... I didn't see him!
-It's not your fault.

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:54.090
<i>It was mine. Stupid.</i>

01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:55.960
-Is he okay?
-He's still breathing.

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.130
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

01:22:58.170 --> 01:22:59.470
Let's get him in your car.

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.140
<i>Your car goes where your eyes go.</i>

01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:04.550
<i>How could I forget?</i>

01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:11.100
<i>Ayrton Senna did not have to die at Imola.</i>

01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:14.150
<i>That's what I was thinking
on the way to the hospital.</i>

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:16.860
<i>He struck the concrete barrier</i>

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:20.150
<i>at the Tamburello corner
at 190 miles an hour</i>

01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:22.450
<i>but, by all accounts, he would've survived</i>

01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:24.570
<i>if not for a small piece of suspension</i>

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:26.780
<i>that managed to penetrate his helmet.</i>

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.170
Straight to the back.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.420
<i>But I know the truth.</i>

01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:39.590
<i>Senna died that day</i>

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:41.760
<i>because his body had served its purpose.</i>

01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:45.220
<i>His soul had learned
what it came here to learn.</i>

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:49.060
<i>And I knew that if I had already learned</i>

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.430
<i>what I was meant to...</i>

01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:52.230
<i>I too would be gone.</i>

01:23:53.690 --> 01:23:56.360
<i>But apparently, I still had work to do.</i>

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.900
Fair amount of internal bleeding,

01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.980
also some renal damage.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.610
He is very lucky.

01:24:01.650 --> 01:24:03.240
It could have been far worse.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.370
I have to be honest with you, Mr. Swift.

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:07.120
An old dog like yours,

01:24:07.530 --> 01:24:10.370
this kind of injury's often
the beginning of the end.

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.380
X-rays, sedative, pain meds

01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:24.840
and nighttime emergency fee
comes to $812.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:25.890
Thank you.

01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:31.060
I'm sorry, your card was declined.

01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:35.140
Okay, um... here's my debit.

01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:39.860
It says insufficient funds.

01:24:40.230 --> 01:24:41.320
Is there a problem?

01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:43.700
I deposited my paycheck
today, so it...

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:45.780
probably just needs to clear.

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.990
I do have some cash. I have...

01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:49.620
$300.

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:51.450
I can go to the bank
first thing in the morning

01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:53.120
and bring the rest by then.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.960
It's fine. These things happen.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.080
Write a receipt for the $300,

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.460
leave a note for Susan
to invoice the balance in the morning.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:24:59.500
Actually...

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.710
are you okay if I keep just twenty of it?

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.760
Thank you.

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.640
You ready to go home? Huh, pal?

01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:20.980
<i>The medication kept me
in a near constant dream state for weeks,</i>

01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:23.440
<i>which I confess came as a relief.</i>

01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:31.240
<i>Anything to replace that look
I'd seen on Denny's face.</i>

01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:35.660
It's not for me to say
whether it's the right decision or not.

01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:36.750
But, for what it's worth,

01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:38.830
I support you on this a hundred percent.

01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:40.420
Me, too.

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:41.960
You're doing what you have to do.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.840
Zoë will understand when she's older.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.340
The visitation schedule
will be as we discussed.

01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:47.590
Plus, three weeks in the summer,

01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:50.390
a week at Christmas,
and the April school break.

01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:52.970
-But what about the charges?
-They'll be dropped immediately.

01:25:53.010 --> 01:25:54.720
Like I said, Denny, we had leverage.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.980
<i>A sharp panic rose in my throat.</i>

01:25:58.390 --> 01:26:00.730
-I need a pen.
<i>-Was I still dreaming?</i>

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.440
<i>Who was this person, this imposter?</i>

01:26:04.690 --> 01:26:06.030
<i>What had he done with Denny?</i>

01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:08.360
Sorry. Only one I could find.

01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:11.450
<i>And then all was revealed.</i>

01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:13.450
<i>It wasn't Denny.</i>

01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.120
<i>It was the zebra.</i>

01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.750
<i>I'd been in a position
to prevent the demon</i>

01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:20.170
<i>from destroying Zoë's toys</i>

01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:21.460
<i>and I'd failed.</i>

01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:23.550
<i>I knew I had to stop it,</i>

01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:24.750
<i>but how?</i>

01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:32.180
Enzo! Give me those papers!

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.760
Come here!

01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:36.350
-Where'd he go?
-Out the window!

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:40.190
Enzo, you give me those papers!

01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:43.900
It's not funny, Tony. Enzo, drop it! No!

01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:47.570
I mean, it's kind of funny.

01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:49.820
Hey, hey, hey.

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:51.910
Okay, you made your point.
you made your point.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.130
Call their lawyers.

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.550
Tell 'em we'll see 'em in court.

01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:09.050
I'm with Enzo on this one.

01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:10.430
You're sure?

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:11.720
I made Eve a promise.

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:13.470
I'm not quitting.

01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:15.850
Man, I got to get me a dog.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.520
<i>Denny was prepared
to risk everything.</i>

01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.110
<i>Lose the case and he would lose Zoë.</i>

01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:31.570
<i>His breathing that morning
struck me as unusual.</i>

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:36.200
<i>Deep inhalations, quick exhalations.</i>

01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:39.540
<i>It was a sound I recognized.</i>

01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:42.420
<i>It was the way he breathed
just before a race.</i>

01:27:58.220 --> 01:27:59.680
This is it, Enz.

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:09.900
It's Tony.

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.410
Hey, man. Thanks for coming by.

01:28:16.450 --> 01:28:20.200
I would've brought him by the shop,
but he hasn't been doing too good lately.

01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:21.290
Yeah, poor little guy.

01:28:21.330 --> 01:28:22.960
Hey, Enz,
look who's here. It's Tony!

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.120
Hey, Enz, buddy. How you doing, hm?

01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:27.630
-Good luck, Den.
-Thanks, man. Yeah.

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:33.510
You want to watch TV?

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.640
<i>Dogs are not allowed in court,</i>

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:40.720
<i>so I was forced to imagine
what was happening across town.</i>

01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:43.480
<i>I invented whole scenes in my head</i>

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:46.650
<i>fueled by Denny's nightly retelling
of the day's events,</i>

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:49.900
<i>as well as my own
admittedly melodramatic sensibility.</i>

01:28:50.150 --> 01:28:51.530
<i>Objection, Your Honor!</i>

01:28:51.570 --> 01:28:53.280
<i>Perhaps it was my advanced age</i>

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.700
<i>but I found my imagination</i>

01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.740
<i>increasingly prone to wandering.</i>

01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:59.280
<i>No, sir, I most definitely did not.</i>

01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:00.330
<i>Until...</i>

01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:06.250
<i>Isn't it possible at some point
you decided...</i>

01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:08.540
<i>Your Honor, I object.
Asked and answered.</i>

01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:09.590
<i>How?</i>

01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:13.090
Yeah.

01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:14.470
<i>You don't even
remember killing--</i>

01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:15.590
I'm on my way.

01:29:17.010 --> 01:29:18.340
Something's happened, bud.

01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:19.720
You want to come?

01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:22.310
What's going on, Den?

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:26.850
<i>With some effort, I was able to
decipher what had happened.</i>

01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:28.020
So help me God.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.690
<i>Today was the day Trish had testified.</i>

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.240
Can you please tell the court
about the alleged assault?

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:36.610
It happened the way
my husband said it did.

01:29:36.650 --> 01:29:39.120
So, you personally
witnessed Dennis Swift

01:29:39.370 --> 01:29:41.830
throw your husband,
a man 20 years his senior, to the ground

01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:44.620
fracturing a rib
and very nearly his wrist?

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.160
Yes.

01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:48.370
Thank you. No further questions.

01:29:52.130 --> 01:29:53.500
You can step down now.

01:29:54.090 --> 01:29:56.300
I'm going to suggest
that we take a brief recess here

01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:59.800
while I review all of
the testimony and materials.

01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:01.680
I can't.

01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:06.810
Excuse me?

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.520
I can't!

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.150
I can't do this.

01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:13.110
I thought I could, but I just...

01:30:14.650 --> 01:30:17.950
I didn't see anything.
I'm only saying what you told me to say.

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.490
I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore.

01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:25.080
I know that Denny loved Eve too much
to ever hurt her father.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.290
Objection. The witness
is clearly speculating.

01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:29.420
It's your witness, counselor.

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.590
<i>They dropped the charges.</i>

01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:38.090
All of it. Tossed out.

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:41.550
You did it, Denny. It's over, man.

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.140
<i>He'd done it.</i>

01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:48.100
<i>Denny's risk had paid off.</i>

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:52.110
<i>If a driver has the courage
to create his own conditions...</i>

01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.690
<i>then the rain is simply rain.</i>

01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:05.790
Daddy!

01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:08.620
-I missed you.
-Oh, I missed you.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.670
<i>Zoë was ours again.</i>

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:17.130
<i>Denny had won her back,
and it was a victory for the ages.</i>

01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:20.550
Come on.

01:31:31.730 --> 01:31:34.480
<i>Denny, this is Luca Pantoni
returning your call.</i>

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:36.190
Luca, yes, hi.

01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:38.480
Thank you for calling me back.

01:31:38.530 --> 01:31:41.700
I wanted to let you know that the...

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:44.490
issues keeping me in the States
have been resolved.

01:31:44.530 --> 01:31:48.120
<i>I could just picture him
on the terrace of some magnificent villa.</i>

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.290
<i>I can tell by your voice</i>

01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:51.040
they were resolved to your satisfaction.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.080
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:56.380
And I was wondering if the job
that you'd offered me earlier,

01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:58.340
<i>-if that was still available?
</i>-It is.

01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:02.760
Then my daughter and I,
and our dog, Enzo,

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.720
would very much like
to join you in Maranello.

01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:07.930
Your dog's name is Enzo?

01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:10.390
Yeah, he's a racecar driver at heart.

01:32:10.770 --> 01:32:13.520
<i>Okay, I will have my assistant
make all the arrangements.</i>

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:15.520
Welcome to Ferrari.

01:32:16.110 --> 01:32:17.900
<i>We will talk again soon, Denny.</i>

01:32:18.570 --> 01:32:19.440
<i>Ciao.</i>

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:22.030
<i>Ciao.</i>

01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:32.250
-What is it, Zoë?
-Wow!

01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:34.500
This is a great party,
look at these gifts, it's great.

01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:35.710
-Nice cake, Denny.
-So cute.

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:38.800
"Wishing you a fairytale birthday."

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:40.460
What'd you get?

01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:43.010
-Daddy, look!
-Oh, cool.

01:32:47.010 --> 01:32:47.970
I don't--

01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:50.430
If you want me to go, I could--

01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:03.400
-Grandma!
-Hi, sweetheart.

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:05.910
<i>I might not have been as forgiving.</i>

01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:09.030
<i>But Denny had Zoë to think about.</i>

01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:16.790
<i>I'd often heard the expression
"to be the better man."</i>

01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:18.590
Grandpa!

01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:21.050
<i>Well, I knew
no better man than Denny.</i>

01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:22.590
Big number nine.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.220
Big number nine.

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:26.840
All right.

01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:28.470
-You ready?
-Ready...

01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:30.930
steady... go!

01:33:33.930 --> 01:33:36.440
-Happy birthday. Happy birthday.
-Thanks, Daddy.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.310
-Okay, who wants cake?
-Me!

01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:40.610
Yeah? Okay, Grandma,
will you help me with this?

01:33:40.650 --> 01:33:42.480
Can you grab a knife from the kitchen,
please?

01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:44.690
<i>Sometimes my life
seems like it has been</i>

01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:47.530
<i>so long and so short at the same time.</i>

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:51.490
<i>I feel as if I've lived for an eternity.</i>

01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:54.660
Yo, Enz!

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.790
<i>And yet it's as if no time
has passed at all.</i>

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.040
Enzo?

01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:02.550
<i>I hear the worry in his voice.</i>

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.300
What happened, pal?

01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:09.510
Enz.

01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:11.140
<i>I can smell the day on him.</i>

01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:14.930
<i>Motor oil and gasoline and roast chicken.</i>

01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:16.270
Can you get up, bud?

01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:21.940
<i>I saw a documentary
about Mongolia on TV once.</i>

01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:24.440
Okay.

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.690
<i>In Mongolia, when a dog dies,</i>

01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:30.200
<i>he is buried high in the hills,
so people cannot walk on his grave.</i>

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:32.700
I'm here, buddy. I'm right here.

01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:35.250
<i>His master whispers
into the dog's ears</i>

01:34:35.290 --> 01:34:37.660
<i>his wishes that in his next life</i>

01:34:37.710 --> 01:34:39.540
<i>the dog will return as a man.</i>

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:43.590
<i>Not all dogs return as men, they say.</i>

01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:45.380
<i>Only those who are ready.</i>

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.260
Let's get you up.

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:49.590
<i>I am ready.</i>

01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:57.890
<i>I know death is not the end.</i>

01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.810
<i>Eve told me so.</i>

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.600
<i>And I believe her.</i>

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.320
<i>When I return to this world,</i>

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.070
<i>I will practically be an adult</i>

01:35:07.110 --> 01:35:08.740
<i>the moment I am plucked from the womb</i>

01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:10.740
<i>with all the preparation I have done.</i>

01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:13.240
There he is.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.240
<i>I will walk among my fellow men,</i>

01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:18.080
<i>lick my lips
with my small dexterous tongue</i>

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.160
<i>and shake hands with a firm grasp.</i>

01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:21.750
There's my Enzo.

01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:23.880
<i>And I will teach people
all that I know.</i>

01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.000
<i>All that I have learned.</i>

01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:38.770
-You okay now?
<i>-I'm fine, Denny.</i>

01:35:39.230 --> 01:35:40.350
<i>I am.</i>

01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:41.980
You've always been with me.

01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:45.320
You've always been my Enzo.

01:35:47.230 --> 01:35:50.150
First time I saw you,
I knew we were supposed to be together.

01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:57.870
I love you, boy.

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:15.220
What are you doing here?

01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:16.800
I thought we'd go to the track.

01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:18.140
'Cause I have a surprise for Enzo.

01:36:30.690 --> 01:36:32.030
Thanks for arranging this, Don.

01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:33.490
We won't be out long.

01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:35.990
-Take your time. Track's all yours.
-Okay.

01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:37.910
-Have fun.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

01:36:40.290 --> 01:36:42.290
Not too tight? Okay.

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.040
You ready?

01:36:44.710 --> 01:36:45.830
All right.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.630
Drivers, start your engines.

01:36:58.390 --> 01:37:00.890
<i>I have never ever felt so special.</i>

01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:05.020
You did it, man.

01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:15.360
Brakes are warm, tires are warm.

01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:17.780
What do you say we try a hot lap, huh?

01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:25.620
<i>I'd like to stay out here forever.</i>

01:37:32.010 --> 01:37:33.590
<i>Stay with them forever.</i>

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:43.770
We're gonna take this one
at speed. You okay?

01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:52.230
<i>I wish I could glimpse
what awaits them in Maranello.</i>

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.910
<i>Denny will be
a wonderful driver for Ferrari.</i>

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:01.370
<i>So wonderful that one day
they will pluck him from the ranks</i>

01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:03.620
<i>to give him a tryout
for their Formula One team.</i>

01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:06.210
<i>"Try me," he'll say.</i>

01:38:06.710 --> 01:38:08.000
<i>I'd like to see that.</i>

01:38:10.130 --> 01:38:11.170
Enzo!

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.010
<i>But we can't have everything we want.</i>

01:38:14.630 --> 01:38:17.590
<i>Besides, the best drivers
don't dwell on the future or the past.</i>

01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:22.720
<i>The best drivers
focus only on the present.</i>

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.600
You've been a good friend.

01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:31.440
A very good friend.

01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:33.480
<i>The best of friends.</i>

01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:37.110
Come here.

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.030
<i>We'll be heading home soon.</i>

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.870
<i>But for now, all I want is one more lap.</i>

01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:48.790
<i>Just one more.</i>

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.960
<i>I'll bark again so he knows.</i>

01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.430
<i>Faster, Denny.</i>

01:39:07.890 --> 01:39:09.100
<i>Faster!</i>

01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:52.980
Dad!

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:57.320
There's some people who want to meet you.

01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:59.360
Come on, they're big fans.

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:00.990
I think you'd really like them.

01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:02.070
You're the boss.

01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:05.660
We are your biggest fans.

01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:07.660
Your daughter said that
you would not mind.

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.330
No, of course not.

01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:12.620
My son, he talks about you always.

01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:13.750
<i>Piacere.</i>

01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:16.210
He races the go-karts. He's very good.

01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:17.500
<i>Bene. Va bene.</i>

01:40:18.130 --> 01:40:20.720
-Could you please sign the program?
-Sure.

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:23.380
We are going to watch the race
from the infield tomorrow.

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:25.680
<i>Come ti chiami?</i>

01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:27.350
Enzo.

01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:30.350
Enzo?

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:32.350
<i>Sì, mi chiamo Enzo.</i>

01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:33.690
My name is Enzo.

01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:36.690
He wants to be a champion.

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:37.770
Like you.

01:40:40.570 --> 01:40:41.490
<i>Mi scusi.</i>

01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:45.820
Your son reminds
me of an old friend of mine.

01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:52.870
My phone number in Maranello.

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:56.080
When you think your son is ready,
give me a call.

01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:58.040
I'll make sure he gets proper instruction.

01:40:58.090 --> 01:41:00.920
<i>Grazie.
</i> He talks about you always.

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.510
He says that you are
the greatest driver ever.

01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:04.880
Better even than Senna.

01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:07.930
Well, he's a racecar driver at heart.

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.100
<i>Grazie! Grazie mille!</i>

01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:11.470
<i>Grazie!</i>

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:12.560
<i>Prego.</i>

01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:27.490
Come on.
