00:43.570 --> 00:45.927
Remember, Bart...
I mean, Dances in Underwear.

00:46.101 --> 00:47.893
- We take the white man alive.

00:48.620 --> 00:51.395
All right, Thinks Too Much.
It shall be so.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.483
Keep your eyes peeled for Injuns.
I mean, Native Americans.

00:56.654 --> 01:00.105
They're after us because we gave them
blankets infected with cooties.

01:00.324 --> 01:02.363
I ate all my caps.

01:03.350 --> 01:06.404
Throw down your weapons
and kiss the prairie, cow dorks!

01:08.582 --> 01:11.583
Why do we have to play
this corny old game anyway?

01:11.794 --> 01:13.620
I brought my jacks!

01:14.421 --> 01:16.414
I got twosies!

01:21.428 --> 01:25.177
That's not fair, Nelson. They didn't have
the Killmatic 3000 back then.

01:25.391 --> 01:29.223
Hey, records from that era
are spotty at best.

01:34.274 --> 01:36.812
Bart! Lisa! Time for church!

01:37.270 --> 01:38.819
Milhouse, time for church!

01:38.988 --> 01:41.858
Shlomo, time for your violin lesson!

01:58.632 --> 02:00.755
Why the crap do we have
to go church anyway?

02:00.926 --> 02:03.844
You just answered your own question
with that commode mouth.

02:04.130 --> 02:06.717
Besides, you kids need to learn
morals and decency...

02:06.932 --> 02:08.592
...and how to love your fellow man.

02:08.767 --> 02:14.722
And with flaming swords, the Aramites
did pierce the eyes of their fellow men...

02:14.898 --> 02:17.899
...and did feast on what flowed forth.

02:18.110 --> 02:21.811
Among whom also we all
once conducted ourselves...

02:21.989 --> 02:23.697
...in the lusts of our flesh...

02:23.866 --> 02:25.989
I'm a troll man

02:27.411 --> 02:29.404
I'm a troll man

02:29.621 --> 02:32.825
I don't want you playing with something
that has such bizarre hair.

02:33.830 --> 02:35.325
Awful, awful hair.

02:40.424 --> 02:42.215
And now my daughter, Jessica...

02:42.384 --> 02:44.673
...who has just returned
from boarding school...

02:44.845 --> 02:47.383
...will read the same passage
I just read.

02:47.556 --> 02:50.427
I noticed a few of you
weren't paying attention.

02:58.108 --> 03:01.109
Wow, there is a God.

03:04.365 --> 03:08.777
I'm telling you, the light would
work better if it pointed out to sea!

03:08.952 --> 03:11.788
Shut up, I know what I'm doing.

03:13.999 --> 03:16.917
I hate the sea and everything in it.

03:17.670 --> 03:21.169
Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Thank you for choosing our church.

03:21.799 --> 03:24.400
I've never felt this way
about a girl before.

03:24.510 --> 03:27.843
My long search is finally over.

03:34.186 --> 03:35.894
Hi, I'm Bart Simpson.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.815
I was incredibly moved by your reading.

03:38.983 --> 03:42.316
I don't think God's words
have ever sounded so plausible.

03:42.528 --> 03:44.686
Thanks, Art.

03:44.989 --> 03:47.693
I have to go over here now.

03:51.954 --> 03:53.828
Don't be so hard on yourself, Bart.

03:53.998 --> 03:56.323
It's not your fault Jessica
doesn't like you.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.374
Is it my hair? My overbite?

03:58.544 --> 04:01.747
The fact that I've worn the same clothes
for the last four years?

04:01.964 --> 04:06.920
No, Bart. I just think you and Jessica
are too different to get along.

04:06.260 --> 04:10.886
She's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter,
and you're the devil's cabana boy.

04:14.977 --> 04:17.468
Good. Very good.

04:17.646 --> 04:19.935
Ralph, Jesus did not have wheels.

04:22.776 --> 04:24.816
- Bart Simpson?
- Yes, ma'am.

04:24.987 --> 04:28.237
I'd like to return to your wonderful
Sunday school, please.

04:28.407 --> 04:30.980
But, Bart, we banned you
from Sunday school.

04:31.201 --> 04:34.784
You were happy. We were happy.
Everybody was happy.

04:34.955 --> 04:36.699
Particularly the hamster.

04:39.793 --> 04:41.501
I've changed my ways.

04:41.712 --> 04:44.370
Please give me
another chance, ma'am.

04:44.256 --> 04:48.254
All right, Bart.
The Bible does teach forgiveness.

04:48.427 --> 04:51.713
Class, I want you to welcome back
our prodigal son.

04:51.889 --> 04:53.846
- What?
- What's prodigal mean?

04:54.160 --> 04:55.344
Oh, dear.

04:55.684 --> 04:58.175
You know, the great thing about
Sunday school...

04:58.354 --> 05:01.230
...is we're finally learning
something we can use.

05:01.190 --> 05:02.898
Yeah, so true.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.767
I have to turn my chair this way now.

05:07.446 --> 05:10.447
Somehow I gotta convince her
I'm a good person.

05:10.616 --> 05:14.827
All right, I have to sit here and behave,
no matter what.

05:14.995 --> 05:18.281
Okay, class. We have a special
treat today for pass-around.

05:18.457 --> 05:22.407
A replica of the slingshot
David used to slay Goliath.

05:22.586 --> 05:26.584
While you kids are looking at that,
I'll just busy myself in this file cabinet.

05:32.179 --> 05:35.346
Must fight Satan.

05:36.725 --> 05:38.848
Make it up to him...

05:41.105 --> 05:42.896
...later.

05:44.191 --> 05:46.729
You know, I was considering
staying after school...

05:46.902 --> 05:49.440
...and helping teacher clean up.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.907
Do you ever think anything
you don't say?

05:55.828 --> 05:58.532
There is just no pleasing
a girl like that!

05:58.706 --> 06:01.660
All that unnecessary behaving.

06:01.959 --> 06:06.668
I'm all tense through the chestal area.
I need relief.

06:13.637 --> 06:16.389
Now, the kilt was only
for day-to-day wear.

06:16.557 --> 06:21.551
In battle, we donned a full-length
ball gown covered in sequins.

06:21.770 --> 06:25.104
The idea was to blind
your opponent with luxury.

06:28.277 --> 06:31.977
'Tis no more than what God gave me,
you Puritan pukes.

06:35.492 --> 06:39.656
That'll hold me, at least till I get
my hands on some kind of explosives.

06:44.793 --> 06:46.620
Congratulations, Simpson.

06:46.837 --> 06:51.131
You just fell for our sting and won
yourself three months' detention.

06:51.342 --> 06:54.508
There's no such thing
as Scotchtoberfest!

06:54.720 --> 06:59.512
There's not? You used me, Skinner!
You used me!

07:00.267 --> 07:02.141
Three months?

07:04.210 --> 07:05.515
Hi, Bart.

07:05.731 --> 07:10.559
I saw the way they set you up.
That was really unfair.

07:12.196 --> 07:14.354
Wanna have dinner
at my house tonight?

07:14.531 --> 07:17.319
Really? Sure.

07:18.285 --> 07:20.574
Great. We eat at 7.

07:21.789 --> 07:24.280
There's only one thing to do
at a moment like this:

07:24.458 --> 07:25.573
Strut.

07:40.474 --> 07:45.266
I can't believe my little boy
is already going on his first date.

07:58.367 --> 08:02.115
Oh, that's sweet, Homer.
Our son is growing up, isn't he?

08:02.329 --> 08:04.536
No, it's not that. Didn't you hear?

08:04.707 --> 08:09.914
They have no bananas.
They have no bananas today.

08:14.341 --> 08:18.386
So, Bart, how's school going?
Jessica always gets straight A's.

08:18.595 --> 08:21.217
Well, in my family,
grades aren't that important.

08:21.390 --> 08:23.548
It's what you learn that counts.

08:23.726 --> 08:25.552
Six times five! What is it?

08:25.978 --> 08:28.813
Actually, numbers don't have
much use in my future career:

08:28.981 --> 08:31.104
Olympic gold-medal rocket-sled champ!

08:31.567 --> 08:33.974
I didn't know the rocket sled
was an Olympic event.

08:34.193 --> 08:37.610
Well, no offense, but what you
don't know could fill a warehouse.

08:37.823 --> 08:39.614
Young man, explain yourself!

08:39.783 --> 08:43.698
Sorry. I have kind of a short fuse,
which some find charming.

08:43.912 --> 08:46.748
Speaking of charming,
watching Fox last night...

08:46.915 --> 08:49.371
...I heard a rather amusing story.

08:49.543 --> 08:52.829
This character named Martin
was feeling rather randy...

08:53.500 --> 08:54.547
...and he was heard to remark...

08:55.758 --> 08:58.427
And don't you ever come near
my daughter again!

08:58.635 --> 09:01.755
Never have I heard such
gratuitous use of the word "butt"!

09:01.972 --> 09:03.764
- But... But... But...
- Make him stop!

09:03.932 --> 09:06.910
- But... But... But...
- Make him stop!

09:12.399 --> 09:15.436
You're bad, Bart Simpson.

09:15.986 --> 09:17.315
No, I'm not. I'm really...

09:17.488 --> 09:20.109
Yes, you are. You're bad.
And I like it.

09:20.324 --> 09:21.901
I'm bad to the bone, honey.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.911
- Let's go find some fun.
- But your father said...

09:25.120 --> 09:28.655
I told the rev I was going
to my room to say my prayers.

09:29.333 --> 09:33.283
Smart, beautiful and a liar.

09:33.462 --> 09:36.498
So much better than that
Sarah, plain and tall.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.976
Right there! Put that there!

09:58.700 --> 10:00.643
Excellent! You're incredible, Jessica.

10:00.864 --> 10:03.818
Your throws, your catches,
your spirals, your loops.

10:04.340 --> 10:07.403
It's like the toilet paper
is an extension of your body.

10:08.956 --> 10:12.407
No way would a minister's daughter
go out with you.

10:12.626 --> 10:14.204
Oh, yeah? I'll prove it.

10:15.296 --> 10:17.454
- Hey, Jessica.
- Yes?

10:17.631 --> 10:20.585
- Am I supposed to know you?
- Jessica, we just...

10:20.759 --> 10:24.709
That's for besmirching
an innocent girl's name.

10:26.265 --> 10:29.349
- Why?
- I'm sorry, Bart.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.430
You know my parents
can't find out about us.

10:32.604 --> 10:37.350
And besides, if it's secret,
it's even more exciting.

10:37.818 --> 10:40.226
- I guess.
- Hey, you wanna go skateboarding?

10:41.710 --> 10:44.487
Actually, I was hoping I could
sit down for just a second.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.487
Come on, it'll be fun.

10:51.248 --> 10:53.822
Now I have the energy to do anything.

10:54.877 --> 10:56.704
Just give me two minutes.

11:00.507 --> 11:02.833
Jessica, I think this is too steep.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.960
Bart, you can't trust your perception
at this altitude.

11:13.354 --> 11:16.224
Actually, if the road surface
maintains its integrity...

11:16.398 --> 11:18.307
...I just might be able to hold on.

11:34.708 --> 11:36.452
The glue will slow me down.

11:36.669 --> 11:40.168
- Any glue leaking?
- No. That glue ain't going nowhere.

11:40.589 --> 11:42.249
Nothing's ever gonna stop me.

11:50.849 --> 11:54.301
Oh, no. There goes the glue after all.

12:02.690 --> 12:03.896
Fun, huh?

12:12.413 --> 12:14.571
Have you noticed any change in Bart?

12:14.790 --> 12:16.284
- New glasses?
- No.

12:16.458 --> 12:18.830
He looks like something
might be disturbing him.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.918
Probably misses his old glasses.

12:21.130 --> 12:23.834
I guess we could get more involved
in Bart's activities.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.333
But then I'd be afraid
of smothering him.

12:26.510 --> 12:29.713
- Yeah. And then we'd get the chair.
- That's not what I meant.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.424
It was, Marge. Admit it.

12:35.477 --> 12:37.636
- Hi.
- We should get to class.

12:37.855 --> 12:40.856
- What's the hurry?
- We could get in trouble for being late.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.649
You worry too much.

12:42.860 --> 12:47.154
Come on. If you stay here a while,
I'll let you hold my hand.

12:53.704 --> 12:55.328
Teamwork! Come on, Bart.

13:00.628 --> 13:03.628
If I don't save the wee turtles,
who will?

13:07.551 --> 13:11.880
Save me from the wee turtles!
They were too quick for me!

13:12.970 --> 13:13.722
I can't believe it, Bart.

13:13.932 --> 13:16.800
I'd always thought Jessica
was so sweet.

13:16.185 --> 13:17.727
She's like a Milk Dud, Lis:

13:17.936 --> 13:21.103
Sweet on the outside,
poison on the inside.

13:21.315 --> 13:24.185
- You gotta give her up.
- No, no, wait. Hear my plan.

13:24.568 --> 13:26.727
Put up with her for seven more years.

13:26.904 --> 13:28.232
Then we'll get married.

13:28.405 --> 13:31.905
Once the first baby comes, she's bound
to settle down and treat me right.

13:32.117 --> 13:33.446
After all, I deserve it.

13:33.661 --> 13:36.827
Bart, it's naive to think
you can change a person.

13:36.997 --> 13:40.413
Except maybe that boy
who works in the library.

13:41.543 --> 13:43.951
Do you have Go, Dog, Go?

13:44.129 --> 13:47.830
That's in Juvenile.
This is Young Adult.

13:47.299 --> 13:50.134
Well-read and just a little wild.

13:50.928 --> 13:53.680
If only someone could tame him.

13:53.889 --> 13:57.472
You're right, Lisa.
Love isn't about fixing someone.

13:57.643 --> 13:59.932
I'm just gonna give her up cold turkey.

14:00.145 --> 14:03.990
I'm not gonna talk to her or see her.
It's over.

14:03.315 --> 14:05.438
Thanks for the advice, sis.

14:16.780 --> 14:19.613
There. If I can just get through
this many days without seeing her...

14:19.790 --> 14:22.790
...she should be completely
out of my system.

14:22.251 --> 14:25.371
Okay, day one.

14:28.966 --> 14:30.460
Time for church, Bart.

14:30.634 --> 14:33.469
I bet your little friend Jessica
will be there.

14:39.810 --> 14:41.719
- Jessica.
- Bart, be strong.

14:41.895 --> 14:43.639
You don't need that little hellcat.

14:45.858 --> 14:48.183
Oh, Lis, she's already
drawn me to her...

14:48.360 --> 14:51.650
...with her beautiful siren song.

14:59.788 --> 15:02.196
That's very disturbing.

15:02.666 --> 15:05.786
Hey, Bart. What? What's wrong?

15:05.961 --> 15:11.860
Well, Jessica, I don't think we should
hang out together anymore.

15:11.258 --> 15:15.635
You're turning me into a criminal
when all I want to be is a petty thug.

15:16.597 --> 15:19.302
Oh, good.
Here comes the collection plate.

15:26.565 --> 15:28.641
"Thirty cents off Shake ’N' Bake."

15:28.859 --> 15:31.267
- Homer!
- We can spare it, Marge.

15:31.445 --> 15:32.856
We've been blessed.

15:33.364 --> 15:35.819
You're right about everything, Bart.

15:35.991 --> 15:38.670
I have been too reckless.

15:38.285 --> 15:42.330
From now on,
I am going to settle down.

15:46.335 --> 15:47.794
Jessica, what are you doing?

15:48.300 --> 15:50.577
Well, it takes money
to start a new life.

15:50.798 --> 15:54.582
Stealing from the collection basket
is really wrong. Even I know that.

15:54.885 --> 15:57.803
Fine. You just lost your cut.

15:58.514 --> 15:59.924
I'll just take that.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.591
Everyone turn around and look at this.

16:05.771 --> 16:07.598
What is it? A Unitarian?

16:11.360 --> 16:14.290
Now just relax. For once,
you didn't do anything wrong.

16:14.196 --> 16:16.817
Just explain yourself
and everyone will understand.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.776
- L...
- Took the money? Yes, we know.

16:18.951 --> 16:21.109
- He confessed!
- Okay.

16:24.123 --> 16:26.411
Stop him!
He's headed for the window!

16:29.628 --> 16:34.337
Son, if you look me in the eye and say
you didn't take the collection money...

16:34.550 --> 16:36.507
...that's all I need.

16:36.927 --> 16:38.718
- I didn't take it.
- Why, you little...

16:38.887 --> 16:40.547
How can you lie like that?

16:40.723 --> 16:43.260
Homer, stop that! I believe him.

16:43.475 --> 16:47.805
Tell me, if he didn't take the money,
why is he wearing those fancy clothes?

16:47.980 --> 16:49.807
That's what he wore to church.

16:49.982 --> 16:51.559
How convenient.

16:51.775 --> 16:54.562
Bart, honey, do you know
who did take the money?

16:57.720 --> 16:58.946
- No.
- See, son?

16:59.158 --> 17:01.150
Telling the truth isn't so bad.

17:05.247 --> 17:06.789
- Boo!
- Boo!

17:06.999 --> 17:08.659
- Why, you little...!
- Crook!

17:08.834 --> 17:10.992
- Thief!
- Stealer of money from the church!

17:15.214 --> 17:16.544
We've gotta talk.

17:16.759 --> 17:20.210
Listen, thanks for not turning me in.
That was sweet.

17:20.679 --> 17:24.262
Well, it seems like if you really
care for me, you should come forward.

17:24.433 --> 17:27.848
Don't you see? It's because I care
for you that I can't come forward.

17:29.630 --> 17:30.473
That doesn't make any sense.

17:30.689 --> 17:32.598
Then I just don't feel like it, okay?

17:32.816 --> 17:36.814
Jessica, you're really beautiful,
but you are not very nice.

17:37.863 --> 17:40.354
With the way you treat me,
why should I protect you?

17:40.532 --> 17:43.699
Because if you tell,
no one will believe you.

17:43.869 --> 17:47.487
Remember, I'm the sweet,
perfect minister's daughter.

17:47.706 --> 17:49.248
And you're just yellow trash.

17:54.838 --> 17:56.630
So here's where you're hiding.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.755
This is my only refuge from the taunts
and accusations of the townspeople.

18:00.928 --> 18:02.588
Thief.

18:03.180 --> 18:05.801
Bart, we can't just let her
get away with this!

18:06.160 --> 18:08.851
Give it up, Lis.
She's a criminal mastermind.

18:09.103 --> 18:13.147
She's got a 108 IQ,
she reads at a fifth-grade level.

18:14.566 --> 18:17.140
And her hair smells
like red Froot Loops.

18:17.319 --> 18:21.566
Yeah? Well, I eat Froot Loops
for breakfast.

18:21.907 --> 18:23.734
Because of last week's problems...

18:23.909 --> 18:27.159
...we'll be taking certain precautions
with this week's collection.

18:27.371 --> 18:30.954
We shouldn't have let them do this.
It can't be helping his self-esteem.

18:31.166 --> 18:34.333
Now for our offertory reading,
Lisa Simpson...

18:34.545 --> 18:36.833
...who we'll all be keeping an eye on.

18:38.382 --> 18:42.711
I know most of you have already judged
my brother guilty without any proof.

18:42.928 --> 18:48.302
But doesn't the Bible teach us
"judge not, lest ye be judged," Reverend?

18:48.475 --> 18:50.883
I think it may be somewhere
towards the back.

18:51.103 --> 18:53.641
There is someone among us
with a guilty conscience.

18:53.814 --> 18:58.610
After much soul-searching, I decided
it would be wrong of me to name names.

18:58.277 --> 19:02.738
But I urge that guilty person here,
under the eyes of God...

19:02.906 --> 19:04.982
...to come forward, to confess...

19:05.159 --> 19:09.737
...and save yourself from the torment
of your own personal hell!

19:10.122 --> 19:12.613
I smelled some marijuana smoke
in Vietnam!

19:12.833 --> 19:15.750
I was the one that canceled Star Trek!

19:15.252 --> 19:18.455
I left my Porsche keys
inside Mrs. Glick.

19:18.672 --> 19:21.377
I am talking to
the collection-money thief!

19:21.592 --> 19:26.170
Only you can come forward
and end this injustice!

19:29.349 --> 19:32.516
Oh, what the heck.
It was Jessica Lovejoy!

19:33.979 --> 19:37.763
If you search her room,
I am certain you will find the money.

19:37.983 --> 19:40.308
- To the little girl's room!
- Yeah!

19:42.488 --> 19:44.527
That's the collection money!

19:44.698 --> 19:46.442
Oh, yeah. Smells like church.

19:46.658 --> 19:48.734
I guess it's obvious
what's happened here.

19:48.911 --> 19:53.390
Bart Simpson has somehow managed
to sneak his bedroom into my house.

19:55.959 --> 19:58.118
Well, come on! Use your imaginations!

19:58.337 --> 20:01.706
No, Dad. I did it.

20:02.216 --> 20:06.480
It's your classic cry for attention.

20:06.220 --> 20:08.889
Well, young lady, I suppose
we brought you home...

20:09.560 --> 20:11.464
...from boarding school
a little prematurely.

20:11.683 --> 20:13.972
I was expelled, Dad.

20:14.144 --> 20:16.220
Remember the pipe bomb?
The glee club brawl?

20:16.397 --> 20:18.685
Remember the school chapel
collection plate?

20:18.857 --> 20:23.354
The exploding toilets ring a bell?
Come on, Dad, pay attention to me!

20:23.570 --> 20:24.981
Hello, in there. Hello?

20:25.739 --> 20:29.191
I think you all owe my son an apology.

20:29.451 --> 20:32.121
- Very sorry.
- That's okay. Appreciate it.

20:37.501 --> 20:39.659
- Hi, Jessica.
- Hi, Bart.

20:39.878 --> 20:41.586
Come to watch me suffer?

20:41.797 --> 20:45.711
I just wanted to let you know that even
though this was a difficult experience...

20:45.884 --> 20:47.628
...I really learned a lot.

20:47.845 --> 20:51.427
I'm a little wiser
and a little less naive.

20:51.640 --> 20:56.883
Well, I learned that I can make men
do whatever I want.

20:57.620 --> 21:01.274
Well, don't you see, Jessica?
Then you really haven't learned...

21:01.483 --> 21:03.476
Would you finish scrubbing these steps?

21:03.694 --> 21:05.687
Will I?

21:06.947 --> 21:08.739
Hey, Jessica!

21:08.949 --> 21:10.609
Coming!

21:13.829 --> 21:18.621
Poor sucker. It's amazing what
some guys will do for a pretty face.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.251
Not me though.

21:20.461 --> 21:24.458
Wait till she sees the second-rate job
I do on these stairs.

22:24.316 --> 22:26.392
