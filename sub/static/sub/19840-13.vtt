00:01.268 --> 00:04.003
<i>Previously on</i> Greenleaf...

00:04.003 --> 00:06.739
- I had a really nice time tonight.
- Yeah, me, too.

00:06.741 --> 00:08.507
<i>He pecked me on the cheek.</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:09.675
I don't know if there's
something wrong with me

00:09.677 --> 00:12.011
or if I just attract
a certain type.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.279
- I don't think he's gay.
- I don't know what he is.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.216
Lionel, you just gonna
swoop in here and save me,

00:17.218 --> 00:19.251
prove to me that I should've
run off with you

00:19.253 --> 00:20.452
when I had a chance?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.488
My wife Kerissa
and I have taken up

00:22.490 --> 00:26.025
the Lord's challenge to found
the Real Church of Memphis,

00:26.027 --> 00:29.228
a ministry dedicated to serving
the homeless and hopeless.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.662
I used to be married.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.465
We were on our way to a matinee
one Sunday afternoon,

00:33.467 --> 00:35.801
and we got Tboned
in an intersection.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.070
I asked a pastor
after the funeral

00:38.072 --> 00:39.738
if he could help me understand.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.307
He said it's best
we don't question God.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.576
So I haven't been back
to church since.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.645
- We cover the debt.
- You give us Triumph II.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.814
That way the money gets replaced
and you don't go to jail.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.650
Just give me two weeks. I've owed you
50 before, and I've come up with it.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.353
So Basie lost the church's
money, not his own.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.722
- That's right.
- And you two paid it back?

00:56.724 --> 00:58.724
Yes. We got the land
and the house,

00:58.726 --> 01:01.093
- but we should've gotten Triumph.
- Can you prove it?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:33.661 --> 01:35.294
She can't hear you.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.433
I didn't say anything.

01:42.636 --> 01:43.869
Good girl.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.725
- Say hi to Winnie for me.
- Love you.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.494
Bye.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.463
- How's your dad?
- Good.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.265
Any verdict on cotillion?

02:13.267 --> 02:14.333
He can't come.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.534
Honey, I'm sorry.

02:15.536 --> 02:19.204
Yeah, but... he's busy.

02:19.206 --> 02:21.406
I get it.

02:21.408 --> 02:25.577
So, what's up
with you and Darius?

02:25.579 --> 02:27.613
What do you mean?

02:27.615 --> 02:29.681
It seemed like he was
finally coming around,

02:29.683 --> 02:31.216
but now he's gone.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.318
Yeah, we're taking a break.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.321
Well, you know the key to making
a relationship work, right, Mom?

02:36.323 --> 02:39.158
- What's that?
- Having one.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.261
Well, enjoy your
Day of Beauty with Grandma.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.631
That's today.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.899
Yes.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.936
Bass Reeves?

02:50.938 --> 02:52.604
That's Basie's alias.

02:52.606 --> 02:56.542
Apparently he was some
lawman from the Old West.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.377
I've heard of him.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.746
What that boy lacks in morals,

03:00.748 --> 03:03.182
he more than makes up for
in imagination.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.583
May I see it?

03:04.585 --> 03:06.251
Yeah.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.422
It's clear he stole
from the church.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.658
I'll threaten him with jail
unless he resigns.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.459
What?

03:14.461 --> 03:16.962
And the accountant
saw huge sums of money

03:16.964 --> 03:19.831
coming and going like cruise
ships and said nothing?

03:19.833 --> 03:21.633
She was scared.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.235
We assured her
she wouldn't be implicated,

03:23.237 --> 03:25.204
by the way, if the
police do get involved.

03:25.206 --> 03:29.308
A fella in Gatlinburg just got
51 months in federal prison

03:29.310 --> 03:31.310
for embezzling
a lot less than this.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.946
Oof. I'm sure Basie's
going to see reason.

03:33.948 --> 03:36.782
This is an unholy mess.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.451
I'll tell you what he says.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.920
Okay.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.627
Just be sure that he puts
Jacob in charge of Triumph.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.396
It's not enough
just to have him resign.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.332
The bishop knows, dear.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.668
- It's just...
- No "it's just."

03:56.670 --> 03:59.338
You didn't do this
only to help Bishop.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.306
We understand that perfectly.

04:01.308 --> 04:04.243
We want to see Jacob
succeed, too, dear.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.645
I'll do what I can,
but ultimately,

04:06.647 --> 04:08.847
it'll be up to Basie.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.882
Well, thank you.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.318
- Either way.
- No, thank you.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.555
I can't tell you how much lighter I
feel with these weapons in hand,

04:16.557 --> 04:19.658
to see the end of the road
after so much hard travel.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.260
I can imagine.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.430
- First Lady.
- First Ladytobe.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.633
Be the Good Lord willing.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.867
Yes.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.713
Of course, Triumph
will become Calvary II

04:41.715 --> 04:43.882
when the dust settles
on all this mayhem.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.919
One step at a time, dear.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.289
One step at a time.

05:38.972 --> 05:42.808
So... did you get your tux yet?

05:42.810 --> 05:45.377
Nah, I still gotta do that.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.412
Come on, you gotta get moving.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.881
Roberto went to, like, six
different places to find one.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.354
They're running out.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.356
You should put that on right.

05:58.959 --> 06:02.060
Just looking out for you.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.497
I'll send you a text of where
Roberto found his, okay?

06:05.499 --> 06:08.633
Yeah, all right. That's cool.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.472
- How was the flight?
- It was good.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.141
Although I did do
my fair bit of praying

06:16.143 --> 06:17.376
over Hurricane Mills.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.046
Someday maybe I'll be able
to convince you

06:21.048 --> 06:23.648
to move to Nashville,
and this'll all become easier.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.083
Maybe.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.852
If things clear up.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.687
What's not clear?

06:28.689 --> 06:32.090
Whatever. So?

06:32.092 --> 06:35.627
Here is the latest instrumental
to noodle around with

06:35.629 --> 06:37.496
before she gets here.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.899
- Is Jekalyn in town yet?
- No, her plane lands around noon.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.001
I wanted to give you a chance to get
settled in and work on that bridge.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.770
She's still not happy with it?

06:44.772 --> 06:47.005
No, but you'll figure it out.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.474
I'll go get this mess
cleared up at the hotel.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.109
Hey.

06:51.111 --> 06:54.946
I know you're used to working
with artists that make demands,

06:54.948 --> 06:57.182
but you don't have
to put me in a hotel

06:57.184 --> 06:58.683
if you have a guest room.

07:03.190 --> 07:06.191
No, it's better this way.
It gives you your privacy.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.426
All good.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.461
Okay, just trying to help.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.797
Help with that bridge.
It's all the help we need, baby.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.666
I'll get right on it.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.039
I called the La Bella
Mobile Nail Spa.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.608
The manicurists are on the way
to the nursing home now,

07:23.610 --> 07:25.644
and here are the gift bags
for the ladies.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.646
With the Le Labo soap inside?

07:27.648 --> 07:29.648
Yes, I called the hotel

07:29.650 --> 07:31.716
you and the bishop
stayed at in Nags Head.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.785
They not only told me
what kind it was,

07:33.787 --> 07:35.020
they sent me a whole case.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.789
Blessed!

07:37.791 --> 07:39.224
What can I say?

07:39.226 --> 07:42.561
The Lord lays out
the the path, and I process.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.529
That's a good tweet.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.997
â™ª Blessed.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.166
And you have a message

07:48.168 --> 07:51.636
from Bishop Geoffries
on the voicemail.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.240
II'll call him back later.
Thank you.

07:55.242 --> 07:58.143
Hi, Mama, Karine.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.212
What?

08:00.214 --> 08:01.813
Another bad night?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.982
You must not have gotten
a wink of sleep.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.117
Do you want to cancel?

08:06.119 --> 08:07.886
Excuse me.

08:10.891 --> 08:11.990
No. Why?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.658
Well, just, you know,

08:13.660 --> 08:15.927
because this is not strictly
an outreach program.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.662
I can do it alone.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.898
Mama, I'm here. Let's do it.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.666
Come on, let's do this.
I got it.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.102
- All right.
- I got it. Come on.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.810
<i>I understand, Elder Johnson.</i>

08:31.812 --> 08:34.179
Well, if that number hits,
you call me.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.981
All right, I'll be praying
for you, too.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.282
All right.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.124
Two visits in one month.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.646
If I didn't know any better, I'd
say you've taken a shine to me.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.531
I know what you've been doing
with the church's money.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.266
I have proof
you stole large sums.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.535
Okay, Satan, I'm confused.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.639
Bass Reeves?

09:00.641 --> 09:03.008
You know there's
strong biblical injunction

09:03.010 --> 09:04.809
against gossip, Bishop.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.678
It's not gossip.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.580
I've got the accountant's
reports to prove it.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.983
How'd you get
your hands on those?

09:11.985 --> 09:14.019
- I didn't come here to discuss that.
- Jacob.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.621
- I came here to help you out.
- Help me out.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.857
- That's right.
- Man, there's not a single problem I got

09:18.859 --> 09:20.592
that you didn't cause.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.260
- Basie...
- Get out of my church.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.034
Skanks, here's the deal.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.802
If you don't publicly resign

09:30.804 --> 09:33.605
and hand the pulpit
over to Jacob,

09:33.607 --> 09:35.707
I'll go to the police
and you'll go to jail.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.977
Is blackmail not a sin anymore.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.846
- What's your answer?
- I already gave you my answer.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.649
Get your peacocking self
out here!

09:44.651 --> 09:46.918
Don't sweep in here
like some phantom of the opera

09:46.920 --> 09:47.919
making threats!

09:47.921 --> 09:51.222
Go on, specter! Git!

10:22.856 --> 10:24.155
It's a beautiful song.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.024
Thank you. I like it, too.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.693
Now, I still have a few tweaks.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.996
I think we need to slow
it down a little bit.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.231
And the bridge
could still use some work.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.067
Whatever you think, I'm sure it's
gonna be the key to the whole thing.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.702
So, you don't like this one?

10:37.704 --> 10:39.938
Well, I'm just hearing
something different

10:39.940 --> 10:42.140
for the chorus
under the melody, okay?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.009
Less sad.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.412
I was going
for a melancholy feel.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.414
I know, and you succeeded.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.150
Whatever you want.
The goal is to make it yours.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.918
Let's try it major.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.188
Yeah, whatever everybody wants.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.724
Okay.

10:59.726 --> 11:02.427
Look, it's not a big fix, okay?

11:02.429 --> 11:04.963
First, let's make it major.

11:04.965 --> 11:09.901
Then right here,
there's just too many words.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.303
I just want to use
this first line right here.

11:12.305 --> 11:15.040
And then on this part,

11:15.042 --> 11:16.941
I'm thinking something like...

11:16.943 --> 11:20.011
You know?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.880
- Yes. Yes.
- You hear what I'm saying? Something like that.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.815
And then we'll
just break it down.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.884
- Okay. Okay, cool.
- Yeah.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.253
That's brilliant.
You are the best, girl.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.996
This red looks great on you.

11:37.998 --> 11:41.266
Yes, I have always loved
fireengine red.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.867
My mama used to say

11:42.869 --> 11:45.970
that only fast girls
wore fireengine red polish.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.306
You a fast girl, Miss Esther?

11:48.308 --> 11:49.774
I wasn't slow.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.776
Miss Esther?

11:51.778 --> 11:53.745
Here's that banana pudding
you requested.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.448
Thank you, darling.

11:56.450 --> 11:59.851
- This is a special day.
- It is.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.853
I can have them bring
you some if you want.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.321
No, ma'am. No, thank you.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.925
You... you see
that girl over there?

12:06.927 --> 12:09.728
- Yeah.
- She has been a godsend.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.262
- She's very nice.
- Yes.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.165
She's so much better than
the last girl who was here.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.267
She was just awful.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.435
How so?

12:17.437 --> 12:22.440
Well, she was rude, and she...

12:22.442 --> 12:23.942
She was rough.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.978
I told the management,

12:26.980 --> 12:29.414
and... and they...
They got rid of her.

12:29.416 --> 12:34.419
You can't just let somebody
treat you that way

12:34.421 --> 12:36.855
and not say something.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.059
You know, Miss Esther,
you did the right thing.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.536
<i>I think I'm failing
to make you understand</i>

12:51.538 --> 12:53.304
the sheer beauty
in the piece, Eileen.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.374
What you need to do
is call Tasha,

12:56.376 --> 12:58.877
talk to her, see it in person.

12:58.879 --> 13:03.348
Yes, ma'am, it is a genuine
Mickalene Casteel,

13:03.350 --> 13:05.884
signed and dated,
worth every penny.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.954
Excuse me, I'll...
I'll call you back.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.292
Victor. My brother.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.996
I was just about to call you.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.902
I'm sorry.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.004
I'm just so scared.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.274
I'm so scared, baby.
I don't know what to do.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.810
- Come here. Come here.
- Baby, I'm...

13:31.812 --> 13:34.345
Please listen to Bishop.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.948
Turn yourself in, baby.
Do it for me.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.083
I know.

13:39.085 --> 13:42.921
I told you to quit playing.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.156
You did.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.858
I'm sorry.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.561
Why didn't you listen?

13:49.563 --> 13:52.230
Why?

13:52.232 --> 13:54.098
I couldn't hear it.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.269
I'm glad we got it right.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.171
Yeah, you know,
sometimes it just takes time.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.840
Forest for the trees.

14:01.842 --> 14:02.907
See you at dinner?

14:02.909 --> 14:04.843
If I'm invited.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.579
Invited?
You are the guest of honor.

14:07.581 --> 14:10.481
Well, then,
I guess I'll be there.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.116
Amen.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.418
Well, all righty, then.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.886
All right.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.963
What's the matter with you?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.297
She wrecked my song.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.266
She's the customer.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.002
You and I,
we're the manufacturers.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.404
If the customer wants two handles
on a fork, you give it to them.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.039
Well, I liked it the way it was.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.308
Look, she left happy.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.344
My guess is this time tomorrow,

14:39.346 --> 14:41.613
if you work out those
last few notes she gave you,

14:41.615 --> 14:44.115
you're gonna have
a song on her record.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.150
Isn't that the point?

14:46.152 --> 14:47.552
Jabari, what are we doing?

14:47.554 --> 14:48.887
Making music.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.521
No. Us.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.523
What about us?

14:52.525 --> 14:54.559
Do you like me or what?

14:55.595 --> 14:57.562
- What?
- Do you like me?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.664
Of course I like you. All right?

14:59.666 --> 15:01.332
I don't work with people
I don't like.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.370
Like me like me.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.971
You kiss her, I kiss you.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.573
I mean, is that what
everybody does around here?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.174
I just kissed her on the cheek.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.043
- You know what I mean.
- Charity.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.578
Just tell me the truth.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.648
I told you the truth.
I like you.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.951
Now, can we get this song sold,
then discuss whatever else?

15:21.488 --> 15:22.954
Please.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.389
You're the boss.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.590
Praise God, I actually am.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.163
We'll talk.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.199
But now, miss,
if you'll excuse me,

15:35.201 --> 15:37.535
we'll throw some drums under this
mix before we see her tonight.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.697
These loops ain't cutting it.

15:59.659 --> 16:03.061
- Thank you for driving.
- My pleasure, Mama.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.700
That was a nice time.

16:08.702 --> 16:11.402
Yeah, I'm glad I went.

16:13.273 --> 16:17.041
Don't quote me,
but I hope I go fast

16:17.043 --> 16:19.210
and before your father.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.679
Mama, what a thing to say.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.716
Well, I only mean... I mean,
the thought of lingering

16:24.718 --> 16:28.086
for lonely years in a place
even as nice as that,

16:28.088 --> 16:31.456
making new friends?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.624
Let's just say it's not
a blessing that I...

16:33.626 --> 16:36.327
make particular time for.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.262
Mama, I'm so glad we did this.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.398
You're right,
it was a nice time.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.704
- Hey.
- What?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.606
I got you a present.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.675
What kind of present?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.377
In the glove box. Check it out.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.222
Tickets to Floodgate?

17:04.223 --> 17:06.290
Yeah.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.525
I'll be playing a set there now.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.693
Had my agent hook it up.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.762
That's...

17:11.765 --> 17:14.398
that's the same weekend
as my cotillion.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.367
- You know that.
- Yeah, I know.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.403
But you can do this instead.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.204
I don't want to.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.075
I want to go to the cotillion.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.778
Okay, but if I'm not going,
Zora, who you gonna go with?

17:28.214 --> 17:30.081
I don't know.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.115
Somebody.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.056
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

17:41.728 --> 17:43.828
How many times I gotta tell you
to put that thing on right?

17:43.830 --> 17:46.564
- Are you trying to kill me?
- You did it to yourself.

17:46.566 --> 17:50.101
Isaiah, take me home now.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.202
No.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.238
Yes. Take me home.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.608
Look, I'll take you
to the cotillion, okay?

17:57.610 --> 17:59.143
Okay?!

18:00.814 --> 18:02.346
Take me home.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.417
Whatever.

18:10.356 --> 18:13.257
He called our bluff.
What can I say?

18:13.259 --> 18:15.226
Well, so now what do we do?

18:15.228 --> 18:17.261
Go to the police.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.564
Well, but where
does that leave Jacob?

18:19.566 --> 18:20.765
Kerissa, that was the plan.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.433
I know that was
the plan, Bishop,

18:22.435 --> 18:24.402
but there's no guarantee
that the elders a Triumph

18:24.404 --> 18:26.537
will hire Jacob
if it all comes out like this.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.340
The plan was to do it quietly

18:29.342 --> 18:31.642
and then have Jacob
just step in.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.411
Did you even tell Jacob
about this?

18:33.413 --> 18:35.313
No.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.449
I wanted to make sure that
there was a real offer first.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.351
Really?

18:40.353 --> 18:43.221
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

18:43.223 --> 18:46.457
But the Jehovah's Witnesses have
been in the neighborhood lately.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.261
Tasha?

18:50.263 --> 18:52.797
They beat up my Basie.
What do you mean? Who?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.599
The people that
he owes money to.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.535
They... they messed up
his beautiful face.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.138
So, Basie owes more money than we thought.
Are you all right?

19:00.140 --> 19:01.472
- I need your help.
- I'll get you some Kleenex.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.908
- Just...
- Sit down.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.912
They beat him up bad.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.754
- Look at yourself, son.
- Don't call me son.

19:16.756 --> 19:20.625
Why'd you have to go to him
of all people?

19:20.627 --> 19:22.693
Why would you put your wife
in this position?

19:22.695 --> 19:25.630
Look at your life.
How much are you in for?

19:25.632 --> 19:28.599
- That's none of your business.
- I'm trying to help you here, son.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.402
I said don't call me son.
I don't want your money anyway.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.771
You're not gonna get me off your
conscience that easy, old man.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.407
Well, then I advise you to turn
yourself in to the police.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.576
You're out of options.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.344
You can laugh all you
want to, Pastor,

19:40.346 --> 19:43.181
but the police are the only
ones who can protect you now.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.615
I'm not going to jail.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.185
Let me disabuse you
of that little illusion

19:47.187 --> 19:50.188
I think is hampering
your reasoning here.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.690
You're going to jail either way.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.892
Now, if you give
the church over to Jacob,

19:54.894 --> 19:57.562
you can do it in your own
way in your own time.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.364
You'll still have your dignity
and the satisfaction

20:00.366 --> 20:04.569
of knowing that you're leaving
the church in good hands.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.337
Basie, baby...

20:06.339 --> 20:08.973
just do what he says.

20:10.910 --> 20:14.378
Listen to him, please.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.681
Do it for us. Do it for me.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.852
Okay.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.355
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.690
Okay.

20:25.692 --> 20:26.958
I'll resign Sunday.

20:29.362 --> 20:32.363
Let me talk to the elder board.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.432
And I'll hand my brother
Jacob the keys.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.667
Good.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.576
Thank you.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.328
Why'd you tell my parents
about this

21:37.330 --> 21:40.331
when I expressly asked you
not do? Why?!

21:42.735 --> 21:44.335
Hello there.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.707
"Well, hi, Mom, hi, Dad.
How was your day?"

21:49.709 --> 21:51.842
It was great.
Thank you for asking, Zora.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.412
Gotta pee!

21:54.414 --> 21:56.514
I don't have time for that.

21:56.516 --> 21:59.817
Babe, I know that you're mad
that I did it,

21:59.819 --> 22:03.521
but... you're gonna
thank me one day.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.999
- Hey, Basie.
<i>- Brother Greenleaf.</i>

22:15.001 --> 22:17.935
Look, I don't want
Triumph, Basie.

22:17.937 --> 22:21.005
<i>- Brother...</i>
- I heard all about it.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.474
You do what you wanna do,
but I'm not doing it.

22:23.476 --> 22:26.777
This ain't even about you.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.913
It ain't even about me anymore.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.581
Well, then what's it about?

22:32.852 --> 22:34.719
It's about the people of God.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.855
<i>I failed my flock,</i>

22:37.857 --> 22:40.758
<i>I put my own church in danger.</i>

23:59.539 --> 24:02.673
<i>Don't even think
about telling now.</i>

24:02.675 --> 24:04.475
<i>What good will that do?</i>

24:08.448 --> 24:10.848
<i>They'd never forgive you.</i>

24:10.850 --> 24:14.051
<i>Who would?</i>

24:14.053 --> 24:18.155
<i>No, I'm afraid you're gonna
have to take that little secret</i>

24:18.157 --> 24:20.090
<i>to the grave.</i>

24:23.696 --> 24:26.630
We got all these new programs
starting up right now...

24:26.632 --> 24:28.499
Basketball, Streetwise,

24:28.501 --> 24:30.701
this Open and Inclusive
Coalition

24:30.703 --> 24:32.703
of which we are currently
the only members of.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.104
Who else is gonna grow that

24:34.106 --> 24:36.607
into what God wants it be
if we don't?

24:36.609 --> 24:39.109
Nobody.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.111
I feel you, man,
but I don't know.

24:41.113 --> 24:45.149
Look, I know you don't want
it in this particular way.

24:45.151 --> 24:49.019
But the time's long past
for getting things pure.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.088
I'm not so sure it is.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.658
I finally feel for the first
time in my life, man,

24:54.660 --> 24:57.561
that I'm... that I'm standing
on something real.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.063
- The Real Church of Memphis?
- Yeah.

24:59.065 --> 25:02.700
And I called it that because
that's what it is to me.

25:02.702 --> 25:06.203
I found a way to be real,
and it's working.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.572
I don't want to fall back
into selling myself something

25:08.574 --> 25:10.674
- in the mirror every morning.
- Then don't. Don't.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.810
Make Triumph Church real.
Make it yours.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.812
Repeat the process,
take that feeling

25:14.814 --> 25:18.048
you're talking about, take it...

25:18.050 --> 25:19.617
You're gonna do something
with Triumph Church

25:19.619 --> 25:20.885
I never dreamed of.

25:20.887 --> 25:21.887
I know it.

25:25.558 --> 25:27.024
Why does this have to be me?

25:27.026 --> 25:29.159
'Cause you're my brother.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.228
You're the only brother I got.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.798
Jacob, all the reasons
why you say you shouldn't do it

25:34.800 --> 25:37.001
are all the reasons
why you should.

25:37.003 --> 25:40.070
No one should want
to run a big church like this.

25:40.072 --> 25:41.639
You should do it
because you have to,

25:41.641 --> 25:43.807
because the Good Lord
told you you should.

25:43.809 --> 25:45.776
Come on, what do you say?

25:47.046 --> 25:49.613
I'm not giving you anything.

25:49.615 --> 25:52.283
You've been laying your life
on the line for a friend.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.591
And you got all this in writing?

26:00.593 --> 26:02.259
Well...

26:02.261 --> 26:06.263
given the shadowy nature
of the arrangements,

26:06.265 --> 26:10.968
I'm not sure what kind of notary
we'd get to sign off on this.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.671
I just want to know
this will end it.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.839
I want it done, James.

26:15.841 --> 26:18.275
And I'm not hampered like you
by any sense of guilt

26:18.277 --> 26:19.777
when it comes to this clown.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.178
I want this over with.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.847
This will accomplish that.

26:23.849 --> 26:26.650
After church on Sunday,
I'll turn him in.

26:26.652 --> 26:28.586
Fine.

26:28.588 --> 26:32.256
And as for this sense of guilt
you say I'm hampered by,

26:32.258 --> 26:33.958
this will end that, too.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.826
Don't be so sure.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.028
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.796
<i>Long time no see.</i>

27:12.798 --> 27:15.099
Yeah, I'm sorry.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.368
<i>What's up?</i>

27:17.370 --> 27:18.836
Nothing.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.140
Both of us.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.344
You want to come over?

27:28.881 --> 27:30.681
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:31.984 --> 27:35.819
So, he's going to...

27:35.821 --> 27:38.922
get up there on Sunday
and say his piece.

27:38.924 --> 27:41.392
Is he going to cop
to the whole thing?

27:41.394 --> 27:43.227
We didn't talk about that,

27:43.229 --> 27:46.163
but he's going
to hand over the reins

27:46.165 --> 27:48.966
and have the elders
pray over me, the whole deal.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.968
Changing of the guard.

27:52.872 --> 27:56.206
Thank you for doing this, Jacob.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.910
I know it's a sacrifice
and I know it's scary,

27:59.912 --> 28:02.312
but you can do it.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.381
I want one thing
from you, though.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.383
Anything.

28:08.254 --> 28:11.121
- Pray with me.
- For what?

28:11.123 --> 28:13.824
So we don't screw this up.

28:15.094 --> 28:18.729
Pray that we stay
obedient and faithful.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.832
I mean, I'm letting go
of a lot do this, and...

28:24.070 --> 28:27.337
I want to know
that God's with us and...

28:27.339 --> 28:29.039
that I've got you.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.841
I need... I need to know that.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.177
Yes.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.344
Wherever you want.

28:41.987 --> 28:45.255
Heavenly Father, we come to You

28:45.257 --> 28:47.925
with bowed heads
and open hearts.

28:47.927 --> 28:52.296
I mean, all the things
she was telling us about,

28:52.298 --> 28:55.099
being nominated
for a Grammy at 19?

28:55.101 --> 28:57.034
Yeah, she's impressive.
No doubt.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.970
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.
I'm a total fan.

29:01.941 --> 29:05.075
I can't believe I'm doing this,
but listen to this idea.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.911
- Hang on a second.
- It's for the bridge.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.279
Just wait.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.351
You asked me today
if I like you.

29:14.353 --> 29:17.254
- Let's just forget that.
- No, no, let's not.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.357
You have a baby.

29:21.494 --> 29:22.993
And you're not into that.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.161
Exactly the opposite.

29:26.766 --> 29:29.366
I just don't want to be...

29:29.368 --> 29:32.202
you know, cavalier with someone
who has so much going on.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.074
If I've been hard to read,
that's why.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.478
I'm just... being careful.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.480
Thanks for telling me.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.384
I like you.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.887
I like you, too.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.889
No.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.390
I really like you.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.473
I just...

30:09.475 --> 30:12.442
kinda felt like I needed
to explain myself, you know?

30:15.181 --> 30:18.348
I have trouble
letting people in.

30:18.350 --> 30:22.820
And you trusted me enough
to tell me your story,

30:22.822 --> 30:24.254
so I felt like...

30:26.058 --> 30:27.491
I should probably tell you mine.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.863
Okay.

30:32.865 --> 30:36.033
Okay.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.545
A few years before Mac
abused Faith,

30:48.547 --> 30:50.080
he tried it with me.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.483
You don't have to say anything.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.288
Okay.

31:00.025 --> 31:03.260
He told me about
this old Civil War earthwork

31:03.262 --> 31:05.562
on the property
where the soldiers

31:05.564 --> 31:08.498
used to go to hide out
during the war.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.268
And he made it sound so cool.

31:11.270 --> 31:14.471
So I went with him to see it.

31:22.314 --> 31:26.416
And I fought him off
before he got too far, but...

31:26.418 --> 31:28.218
And I ran away.

31:32.324 --> 31:36.560
I'm sorry. That... that's awful.

31:36.562 --> 31:40.597
No, what's awful
is that I never told.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.466
No one knows but you.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.971
Grace, look...

31:47.973 --> 31:50.474
from what you've told me,

31:50.476 --> 31:52.609
they didn't believe you
when you told them about Faith.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.544
They might not have
believed you then either.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.046
That's not the point.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.682
The point is that
I didn't say anything.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.985
I spent this whole year
asking women to come forward

32:01.987 --> 32:04.388
and say what Mac did to them.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.589
And it worked. You did it.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.691
Yeah...

32:07.693 --> 32:10.560
I never came clean
about what happened to me.

32:12.031 --> 32:15.198
And now that Mac is dead,

32:15.200 --> 32:16.633
it's hitting me harder than ever

32:16.635 --> 32:18.635
the role that I had
to play in all of this.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.672
If I had just said it to Faith,

32:21.674 --> 32:25.375
she might still be alive,
and I hate that.

32:25.377 --> 32:29.546
I hate it, and I can't
go back and fix it.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.548
I can just move forward.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.287
And I don't know how to do that.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.994
I think you do know.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.000
I think you just did.

33:16.729 --> 33:19.029
- Hey!
- Hey.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.597
Are you ready
for the Little Saints?

33:20.599 --> 33:21.999
Yeah.

33:22.001 --> 33:24.034
What are you preaching on
this morning?

33:24.036 --> 33:26.003
"Daniel in the Lion's Den."

33:26.005 --> 33:29.506
That poor boy.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.008
Grandma said
you're not preaching.

33:31.010 --> 33:34.378
No. Reverend Dalton's covering.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.380
I'm going to see
your uncle installed.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.348
I do wish your mother
could be there.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.684
I wish I could be there.

33:40.686 --> 33:44.654
Well, you have the best excuse of
all... the caring of young souls.

33:44.656 --> 33:49.026
By the way, I heard
that you might need

33:49.028 --> 33:50.727
a father to escort you
to the cotillion?

33:50.729 --> 33:52.629
Yeah.

33:52.631 --> 33:55.432
Well, I know it's not the
same as your own father

33:55.434 --> 33:57.567
- walking you in, but...
- No, it's okay.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.269
It's better. Thank you.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.204
It'd be my honor.

34:01.206 --> 34:04.074
Thank you, Grandpa.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.756
Come on, let's grab
something before we go.

36:02.895 --> 36:05.195
And that's the whole
truth of that.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.330
Amen! Amen!

36:10.202 --> 36:11.902
All right, settle down.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.404
Sesesettle down. We...

36:14.406 --> 36:17.240
We've got something else
to talk about, now.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.910
Triumph, I...

36:19.912 --> 36:23.246
boy, this ain't gonna be easy.

36:23.248 --> 36:25.849
I... I stand before you

36:25.851 --> 36:30.487
as Peter stood before Jesus
after having denied knowing him.

36:30.489 --> 36:34.457
I won't go into detail.
The Lord knows.

36:34.459 --> 36:37.260
All I'll say is I have sinned
against God.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.964
I've sinned against you.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.634
And as a result,
I must take my leave.

36:47.406 --> 36:50.874
Now hold on.
Now hold on, hold on.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.344
I can't tell you how much this
hurts me to hurt you like this.

36:54.346 --> 36:56.713
It's one thing
to disappoint yourself.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.249
Disappointing God, well,
that's called being human,

36:59.251 --> 37:01.751
but...

37:01.753 --> 37:04.821
to disappoint the people of God,

37:04.823 --> 37:07.791
that's the worst.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.594
I don't know if I'm ever
gonna get over this.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.596
And maybe just
with your prayers.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.902
Good news.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.404
The good news is...

37:21.406 --> 37:23.807
God is not leaving
his pulpit unattended.

37:23.809 --> 37:28.411
No, you see, He... He led me
to a young brother,

37:28.413 --> 37:30.280
a former associate pastor
of this church

37:30.282 --> 37:31.648
and my dear friend.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.352
Jacob Greenleaf.

37:35.354 --> 37:37.287
Amen.

37:39.491 --> 37:42.659
He's a good man. An honest man.

37:45.330 --> 37:49.432
- And he loves God.
- Amen.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.868
You see, when he left this
church to start his own church,

37:51.870 --> 37:54.537
he found his congregants on
the streets, in the streets.

37:54.539 --> 37:57.007
The boy is radical.

37:57.009 --> 37:59.809
And he's sincere.

37:59.811 --> 38:03.747
And that's why I'm handing
this ministry over to him.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.415
He's the leader you all deserve.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.107
So...

38:14.108 --> 38:15.858
as Moses handed over
the people of Israel

38:15.861 --> 38:18.628
to Joshua,

38:18.630 --> 38:23.400
I hand over the people of God
to you, Pastor Jacob.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.651
Show him more love
than that, Triumph!

39:56.628 --> 39:57.794
Come on in.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.130
Where's Basie?

40:02.834 --> 40:04.401
No.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.569
He's run off?

40:06.571 --> 40:08.571
No.

40:08.573 --> 40:12.075
- I'm not surprised.
- Well, I am.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.744
How can a man run off and leave
a woman as loyal as this

40:14.746 --> 40:16.913
in the lurch?

40:16.915 --> 40:19.015
Unless she knows
where he's headed.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.852
No, I don't.

40:22.854 --> 40:26.956
I tried my best
to get him to stay.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.793
He just couldn't face the notion
of sitting in jail, could he?

40:29.795 --> 40:32.462
No.

40:32.464 --> 40:34.831
He hates to be confined.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.966
My dear.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.868
Why didn't he take you with him?

40:38.870 --> 40:40.970
I wouldn't go.

40:42.441 --> 40:44.107
- Sister Skanks?
- Yes?

40:44.109 --> 40:46.576
- They're ready.
- Thank you.

40:49.047 --> 40:52.982
They planned a little sendoff
thing for him, so...

40:55.520 --> 40:58.988
I'll just do my best
to try to explain.

41:10.902 --> 41:13.736
Poor dear. What do we do now?

41:13.738 --> 41:15.839
Lord knows.

41:15.841 --> 41:17.874
That boy's got a hard road

41:17.876 --> 41:20.877
no matter
what direction he goes.

41:20.879 --> 41:25.849
So, this would be
Jacob's office?

41:25.851 --> 41:28.585
Well, guess I could
spruce it up a little bit,

41:28.587 --> 41:29.986
get some classics in here.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.855
A Persian rug, you know?

41:31.857 --> 41:34.090
It's... it's Lionel.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.661
- Hello?
<i>- James.</i>

41:38.663 --> 41:40.029
I'm sorry to bother you.

41:40.031 --> 41:43.032
No bother.
Is everything all right?

41:43.034 --> 41:45.001
Actually, no.

41:45.003 --> 41:48.605
There's something we need
to talk about... in person.

41:49.808 --> 41:52.742
That sounds ominous.
See you soon, then.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.548
Lionel says he has
something to tell me.
