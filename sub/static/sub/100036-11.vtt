00:01.487 --> 00:02.510
Jack!

00:02.512 --> 00:04.802
- No, Mom, Mom, no!
- Jack!

00:04.804 --> 00:07.094
You know, when you
had your first breakdown,

00:07.096 --> 00:08.151
you thought that was gonna be

00:08.153 --> 00:10.997
- the only one.
- I appreciate your concern.

00:10.999 --> 00:12.299
But I'm fine.

00:12.301 --> 00:13.771
Okay, I am worried that we're just

00:13.773 --> 00:15.279
one big emotional thing
from this happening...

00:15.281 --> 00:16.467
Beth, I'm fine.

00:16.469 --> 00:19.287
It appears you have mild
cognitive impairment.

00:19.289 --> 00:22.234
Things could begin to deteriorate.

00:22.236 --> 00:23.777
I'm sorry to keep asking you

00:23.779 --> 00:25.846
- to keep this to yourself.
- I get it.

00:25.848 --> 00:27.147
Hey, babe.

00:27.149 --> 00:28.216
Hey.

00:29.484 --> 00:30.650
How you doing?

00:30.652 --> 00:33.353
I'm hanging in there.

00:33.355 --> 00:36.991
I'm gonna grab some water,
and then I'm coming to bed.

00:48.604 --> 00:51.838
Okay, maybe we shouldn't have
read them Hop on Pop.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.241
Come on, Dr. Seuss
always puts them to sleep.

00:54.243 --> 00:56.476
All right, Katie girl, come on.

00:56.478 --> 00:57.744
Let's go, up and at 'em, up and at 'em!

00:57.746 --> 00:58.979
- No, no!
- Yes, yes.

00:58.981 --> 01:00.380
Come on, bug, come on, come on, come on.

01:00.382 --> 01:02.682
- You're going with Mom today.
- Oh, let's go to bed.

01:02.684 --> 01:04.450
All right, gentlemen, the last one

01:04.453 --> 01:07.310
under the sheets is a
dirty, stinkin', rotten egg.

01:07.312 --> 01:09.389
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:09.391 --> 01:14.094
Oh, first night in your big-boy beds.

01:14.096 --> 01:16.931
Yep, okay, love you, too.

01:19.468 --> 01:20.967
Good night.

01:25.574 --> 01:27.141
Sleep like kings.

01:38.570 --> 01:41.660
And time. Babe, I tell you, you
shave a few minutes off that,

01:41.662 --> 01:43.056
you're gonna join me
on the leader board.

01:43.058 --> 01:44.912
Are you kidding me? You
know, she made me sing Wham!,

01:44.914 --> 01:46.713
and then Queen as an encore.

01:46.715 --> 01:48.148
Uh-huh.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.560
You know, why don't you call it a night?

01:50.562 --> 01:52.452
- What?
- Yeah, take some cough medicine,

01:52.454 --> 01:54.021
and just pass out.

01:54.023 --> 01:55.689
- What?
- I'm sorry.

01:55.691 --> 01:58.792
You actually think these
three are gonna stay asleep?

01:58.794 --> 02:00.327
With brand-new beds

02:00.329 --> 02:02.753
and Big Three separation anxiety?

02:02.755 --> 02:04.331
Whatever happens, I can
handle it, all right?

02:04.333 --> 02:05.856
- Okay.
- I'm gonna make a pot of coffee.

02:05.858 --> 02:07.701
I rented The Shining. I'm good.

02:07.703 --> 02:09.369
No, I'm good, too. I'm fine.

02:09.371 --> 02:11.972
I'm not even tired. I swear.

02:39.702 --> 02:41.635
Bud, you're not supposed to be up.

02:41.637 --> 02:44.371
Dad, I'm scared.

02:44.373 --> 02:47.207
There's nothing to be scared about, pal.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.644
Yes, there is.

02:58.187 --> 02:59.921
I don't want any trouble.

03:01.023 --> 03:02.757
Okay?

03:04.260 --> 03:05.792
What do you want?

03:05.794 --> 03:06.927
Money?

03:06.929 --> 03:08.585
Uh, okay, I-I-I-I...

03:08.587 --> 03:10.811
I have money, all right?

03:10.813 --> 03:12.780
You can have my...

03:16.472 --> 03:18.272
I'm a city councilman.

03:18.274 --> 03:19.706
You should know that.

03:19.708 --> 03:21.542
And you're in my home.

03:21.544 --> 03:24.243
There are security cameras everywhere.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.181
You already triggered the silent alarm.

03:27.183 --> 03:30.284
Leave now, maybe you avoid the cops.

03:30.286 --> 03:31.470
Hey.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.387
If you stay,

03:33.389 --> 03:35.723
you will not get past me.

04:11.393 --> 04:13.427
Hey, Mom, Mom.

04:13.429 --> 04:14.561
Mom?

04:14.563 --> 04:16.063
Hey! Hey, hey, Mom!

04:16.065 --> 04:17.620
Come on, get out of the lightning.

04:17.623 --> 04:20.146
Please, please! Come in, Mom!
Please come into the house, Mom.

04:20.148 --> 04:22.316
Please, Mom!

04:27.343 --> 04:28.508
Mom!

04:28.510 --> 04:30.244
Mom, please! Can you, please?!

04:30.246 --> 04:31.812
Can you not hear me, Mom?!

04:31.814 --> 04:32.981
Mom, Mom!

04:36.385 --> 04:37.684
Mom!

04:37.686 --> 04:39.186
Mom, please!

04:58.774 --> 05:00.007
- We need to go now!
- Randall?

05:00.009 --> 05:01.174
Calm down, it's just a drill.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.499
- Let's go, please.
- Hey...

05:02.501 --> 05:04.658
Hey, hey, hey! Stop,
stop, stop for a second.

05:04.660 --> 05:07.375
Hey, look at me, look
at me. It's just a drill.

05:07.377 --> 05:09.066
Okay, th-there's, there's no fire.

05:09.068 --> 05:10.083
It's-it's...

05:10.085 --> 05:11.819
it's just a drill.

05:14.601 --> 05:16.602
Uh, come here.

05:21.308 --> 05:23.309
We're okay.

05:28.515 --> 05:30.049
Councilman?

05:31.585 --> 05:33.953
Councilman Pearson?

05:36.923 --> 05:38.656
Sorry, Lieutenant.

05:38.658 --> 05:40.091
What was that?

05:40.093 --> 05:41.659
Just saying we've checked out the house.

05:41.661 --> 05:43.461
Nothing seems to be missing.

05:43.463 --> 05:45.263
We've dusted the downstairs.

05:45.265 --> 05:46.831
- And we can dust upstairs.
- No need.

05:46.833 --> 05:48.666
- I caught him coming in.
- Okay.

05:48.668 --> 05:51.002
And I notice you don't
have a security system.

05:51.004 --> 05:52.537
I highly recommend installing one.

05:52.539 --> 05:55.473
I will. Uh, I've been
meaning to, actually.

05:55.475 --> 05:57.408
We just got so busy with...

05:57.410 --> 05:59.110
- I'll get it done.
- Okay.

05:59.112 --> 06:01.446
Uh, if you'll excuse
me, my wife is upstairs

06:01.448 --> 06:03.348
calming down our girls...
I need to go check on them.

06:03.350 --> 06:05.250
Of course. We're almost finished here.

06:05.252 --> 06:06.752
Uh, Councilman.

06:08.288 --> 06:10.922
I don't want to be an
alarmist, but home invaders

06:10.924 --> 06:13.258
often come back the same
night or the next night

06:13.260 --> 06:16.794
because many families are too
rattled to stay in the home.

06:16.796 --> 06:18.997
We'll have a squad car
posted out front, but...

06:18.999 --> 06:20.332
just an FYI.

06:21.165 --> 06:22.700
- That's good to know.
- Okay.

06:22.702 --> 06:24.002
- Thanks.
- You bet.

06:34.681 --> 06:36.347
What did he want?

06:36.349 --> 06:38.349
Probably just looking for money.

06:38.351 --> 06:40.818
You know, he wasn't gonna hurt us.

06:40.820 --> 06:42.754
That's why he ran away when he saw Dad.

06:42.756 --> 06:44.155
What if he comes back?

06:44.157 --> 06:45.757
Honey, that's...

06:45.759 --> 06:47.825
that's not gonna happen.

06:47.827 --> 06:50.262
How do you know?

06:53.366 --> 06:56.457
Uh, 'cause we're in a big city now.

06:56.459 --> 06:57.982
Cops are like

06:57.984 --> 07:01.005
Avengers out here and...

07:01.007 --> 07:04.118
Yeah. And Dad probably
scared him away for good

07:04.120 --> 07:05.610
with his awful jokes.

07:05.612 --> 07:06.778
Ha-ha-ha.

07:06.780 --> 07:09.080
They're an acquired taste.

07:09.082 --> 07:11.583
Beth, can we talk in the hallway?

07:11.585 --> 07:12.684
Yeah.

07:12.686 --> 07:14.653
You okay?

07:17.757 --> 07:19.757
You okay?

07:19.759 --> 07:22.293
Yeah. You?

07:22.295 --> 07:24.696
As good as can be expected, I guess.

07:24.698 --> 07:25.963
All right.

07:25.965 --> 07:27.465
Uh, 7:00 in the morning.

07:27.467 --> 07:29.534
No one's going back to bed.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.704
You should take the girls and
check into a hotel tonight.

07:32.706 --> 07:34.172
Try to get some rest.

07:34.174 --> 07:36.074
Hotel? Why?

07:36.076 --> 07:37.709
Uh, it's just to be safe.

07:37.711 --> 07:39.677
The-the officer mentioned that sometimes

07:39.679 --> 07:41.846
these guys come back
two nights in a row.

07:41.848 --> 07:43.247
- Oh, my God. No.
- Just...

07:43.249 --> 07:44.549
Uh, you have to come with us.

07:44.551 --> 07:45.750
I'm not leaving you here alone.

07:45.752 --> 07:47.251
- Beth.
- I'm not, Randall.

07:47.253 --> 07:49.153
Beth, I'm staying.

07:49.155 --> 07:51.456
I got to fix the window, make sure

07:51.458 --> 07:53.391
the security system gets installed.

07:53.393 --> 07:55.426
I don't want the girls exposed to that.

07:55.428 --> 07:57.528
And I want to make sure
the house is back to normal

07:57.530 --> 07:58.996
before you come home, okay?

07:58.998 --> 08:00.264
Hey.

08:00.266 --> 08:01.499
Listen to me.

08:01.501 --> 08:04.335
They're leaving a squad car outside.

08:04.337 --> 08:06.337
If this guy is dumb enough to come back,

08:06.339 --> 08:09.340
he'll have to deal with
me and Tess's T-ball bat.

08:09.342 --> 08:11.142
I don't know how you can

08:11.144 --> 08:12.777
joke around at a time like this.

08:12.779 --> 08:16.347
What? All I'm saying is that
he'll have to deal with my bat

08:16.349 --> 08:18.583
and these guns.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.017
Mm.

08:20.019 --> 08:21.720
- Know what I'm saying?
- Mom?

08:23.623 --> 08:25.891
Yeah, baby.

09:16.312 --> 09:17.979
Almond liqueur crÃ¨me pat?

09:17.981 --> 09:21.549
It's okay. It's okay.

09:21.551 --> 09:24.518
It's very nice and strong. I love that.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.053
Marzipan's good.

09:26.055 --> 09:27.388
Chocolate's good.

09:27.390 --> 09:29.090
The jellies are nice.

09:29.092 --> 09:31.759
- The pastry not so.
- Mm-hmm.

09:31.761 --> 09:33.720
- Thank you, Kim-Joy.
- Thank you very much.

09:33.722 --> 09:36.430
Let me help you.

09:36.432 --> 09:38.834
It's okay.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.435
_

09:50.079 --> 09:51.679
You're up?

09:51.681 --> 09:54.736
Why are your texts so formal?

09:54.738 --> 09:56.137
Whatever.

09:56.139 --> 09:57.639
Did I catch you on set?

09:57.641 --> 09:59.963
No, uh, I finished
my reshoot last night.

09:59.965 --> 10:01.478
I'm actually not in L.A.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.314
Oh. Where are you?

10:03.316 --> 10:05.916
Home. Or, well, what
used to be home anyway.

10:05.918 --> 10:08.919
I'm in Pittsburgh doing something

10:08.921 --> 10:10.854
totally stupid.

10:10.856 --> 10:13.757
Right, or maybe not. Maybe it's so...

10:13.759 --> 10:17.127
crazy that it's actually sane.

10:17.129 --> 10:19.296
I'm going to a funeral.

10:19.298 --> 10:21.065
Whose?

10:21.067 --> 10:24.268
Sophie's mom died.

10:24.270 --> 10:26.003
Oh, damn.

10:26.005 --> 10:27.838
You good?

10:27.840 --> 10:29.973
Who knows? What about you?

10:29.975 --> 10:33.043
Someone broke into our house last night.

10:33.045 --> 10:34.812
What? Is everyone okay?

10:34.814 --> 10:36.580
Yeah, everybody's fine.

10:36.582 --> 10:38.182
Please don't tell Mom or Kate.

10:38.184 --> 10:39.750
I don't want anybody to worry.

10:39.752 --> 10:40.951
Okay. Yeah, no.

10:40.953 --> 10:42.853
Geez, Randall, what happened?

10:42.855 --> 10:47.291
Uh, I got home from the
airport around 2:00 last night,

10:47.293 --> 10:48.616
checked on the fam,

10:48.618 --> 10:50.894
came downstairs for a glass of water,

10:50.896 --> 10:54.000
and bam... I was face-to-face

10:54.002 --> 10:56.600
with Christian Slater's
creepy doppelganger.

10:56.602 --> 10:58.202
Whoa.

10:58.204 --> 10:59.370
Yeah.

10:59.372 --> 11:01.271
Kind of rattled me.

11:01.273 --> 11:03.207
Where were you coming from?

11:03.209 --> 11:04.975
Huh?

11:04.977 --> 11:07.678
The airport... where
were you coming from?

11:07.680 --> 11:09.980
Oh, it was a...

11:09.982 --> 11:11.915
I was at a work thing.

11:11.917 --> 11:14.918
It was a fundraiser in Boston.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.787
Dude, it's... it's boring.

11:16.789 --> 11:18.355
I should let you go.

11:18.357 --> 11:19.890
You sure?

11:19.892 --> 11:22.393
You want to chat for a bit?

11:22.395 --> 11:24.728
Pass the old verbal
football back and forth?

11:24.730 --> 11:26.330
Hey, rain check.

11:26.332 --> 11:28.732
Thanks, Kev. Uh, I don't need a catch.

11:28.734 --> 11:30.334
I need to get some sleep.

11:30.336 --> 11:32.002
Good luck in Pittsburgh.

11:32.004 --> 11:33.871
Thanks, man. Night.

11:33.873 --> 11:35.507
Night.

11:44.383 --> 11:46.483
Mom, I can't get this thing to work.

11:46.485 --> 11:48.926
Come on, Reeg, enough with the chitchat.

11:48.928 --> 11:50.354
Bring out Benjamin Bratt.

11:50.356 --> 11:51.812
Mom.

11:51.814 --> 11:53.397
- Oh. Coming.
- He's from the NBC drama

11:53.399 --> 11:55.227
Law & Order. Here's Benjamin...

11:55.229 --> 11:56.827
It's shot.

11:56.829 --> 11:58.429
You have a new job.

11:58.431 --> 11:59.763
Mom, we need some new appliances.

11:59.765 --> 12:01.098
I know.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.367
You're right. You're right.

12:03.369 --> 12:05.428
Don't worry. In the meantime,

12:05.430 --> 12:06.937
your undies will be dry by tomorrow.

12:06.939 --> 12:09.606
Please don't call them undies.

12:09.608 --> 12:11.975
Hey, is Kev coming to your
birthday dinner tomorrow?

12:11.977 --> 12:13.644
'Cause I was thinking
about inviting Beth.

12:13.646 --> 12:16.046
Yeah, he is. He's
driving in with Sophie.

12:17.883 --> 12:19.717
Is that ours?

12:20.786 --> 12:22.753
No, not ours.

12:22.755 --> 12:24.388
Are you getting enough sleep?

12:24.390 --> 12:25.956
You're not normally this sluggish.

12:25.958 --> 12:28.025
Yeah, I-I'm good. It's just...

12:28.027 --> 12:30.394
Are you okay? I've been
trying to call you all night.

12:30.396 --> 12:32.129
I've been having the weirdest dreams.

12:32.131 --> 12:35.432
Well, I thought we were gonna do
a deep dive on Patti last night.

12:35.434 --> 12:38.302
Oh. Hey, why are you so mad?

12:38.304 --> 12:40.271
Did I do something wrong?

12:41.507 --> 12:42.941
Marc...

12:44.610 --> 12:46.143
That didn't sound good.

12:46.145 --> 12:47.845
No. Uh...

12:47.847 --> 12:50.347
But I-I've been watching a
bunch of Dawson's Creek,

12:50.349 --> 12:53.250
and they all talk like that, so...

12:53.252 --> 12:56.220
Sorry, what were you
saying about weird dreams?

12:56.222 --> 12:58.722
- Ugh.
- "Ugh"? That's a nice hello.

12:58.724 --> 13:00.023
Hold on.

13:00.025 --> 13:02.126
Hey, Ma?

13:03.162 --> 13:04.962
Hi, guys.

13:04.964 --> 13:06.263
Guys got here early.

13:06.265 --> 13:09.099
Hi! What a surprise!

13:09.101 --> 13:10.634
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

13:11.837 --> 13:13.770
What's Kate's problem?

13:13.772 --> 13:15.897
She's on the phone with Marc. Hey, guys.

13:15.899 --> 13:18.589
- Oh, she's still dating that greaseball?
- I wasn't expecting

13:18.591 --> 13:19.907
you guys until tomorrow.

13:19.909 --> 13:21.331
My class got canceled,

13:21.333 --> 13:23.110
so we just decided to come early.

13:23.112 --> 13:25.389
- So happy birthday.
- Thank you.

13:25.391 --> 13:27.548
What's with the shrine to
Randall's holey underwear?

13:27.550 --> 13:29.219
See? I've been telling him all morning

13:29.221 --> 13:31.588
- that he needs new undies.
- Please stop saying "undies".

13:31.590 --> 13:33.447
I got to go to class.

13:33.449 --> 13:35.092
I'll see you for your birthday dinner.

13:35.094 --> 13:36.960
Wait. What were you saying before

13:36.962 --> 13:38.595
about the weird dreams?

13:38.597 --> 13:42.099
Just midterm stress.
Don't worry about it.

13:42.101 --> 13:44.334
Stop touching my underwear, Kev.

13:44.336 --> 13:46.337
Your undies, you mean?

13:53.012 --> 13:55.424
It's okay to be scared sometimes, bud.

13:55.426 --> 13:56.680
Okay.

13:56.682 --> 14:00.117
I'm really happy that you
were brave enough to tell me.

14:00.119 --> 14:02.520
See, that way, I can help you fix it.

14:13.562 --> 14:16.764
Oh, boy, I'm jealous of this bed, bud.

14:16.766 --> 14:21.735
This bed is like the Mustang of beds.

14:21.737 --> 14:25.572
You know where the
cool, powerful motor is?

14:25.574 --> 14:27.442
Mm, right there.

14:30.045 --> 14:31.411
What's scaring you, Randall?

14:31.413 --> 14:34.147
- Monsters.
- Monsters?

14:34.149 --> 14:37.210
You think this bed
isn't safe from monsters?

14:37.212 --> 14:38.585
- No.
- No?

14:38.587 --> 14:41.168
Randall, there's no
such thing as monsters.

14:41.170 --> 14:44.038
- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't.

14:44.040 --> 14:48.008
But let's just say there is.

14:48.010 --> 14:50.144
Do you think they can get past Dad?

14:50.146 --> 14:52.980
- Uh-uh.
- Neither do I.

14:52.982 --> 14:55.749
So how about... how about I just...

14:55.751 --> 14:58.190
I lay down right here next to you, okay?

14:58.192 --> 15:01.455
- Mm-hmm.
- So you can go to sleep.

15:01.457 --> 15:03.425
Close your eyes.

15:42.765 --> 15:44.131
Hey.

15:44.133 --> 15:46.633
You're in.

15:46.635 --> 15:48.502
I thought you'd take
more than a day off.

15:48.504 --> 15:50.571
Oh, no way. I've got
way too much to get done.

15:50.573 --> 15:53.607
Hey, uh, Beth and the girls okay?

15:53.609 --> 15:55.876
Uh, they're back home.

15:55.878 --> 15:57.779
Yeah, everything's good. Thanks.

15:58.819 --> 16:00.742
You know, so I was thinking, let's move

16:00.744 --> 16:02.633
tomorrow's town hall
meeting to next month.

16:02.635 --> 16:05.385
Why would I do that?

16:05.387 --> 16:08.155
Randall, this town
hall might be intense.

16:08.157 --> 16:10.157
People, they aren't thrilled about you

16:10.159 --> 16:11.425
supporting Wilkins' housing bill.

16:11.427 --> 16:14.595
I get to hear all
their concerns tomorrow.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.566
Dude, have you slept at all?

16:19.568 --> 16:20.962
I just figured you might want to

16:20.964 --> 16:22.069
take it easy this week.

16:22.071 --> 16:24.139
- You know?
- Sorry.

16:26.937 --> 16:28.526
Got a new security system.

16:28.528 --> 16:31.452
It's got, uh, motion
detection, facial recognition.

16:31.454 --> 16:33.213
It's cutting-edge stuff.

16:33.215 --> 16:34.715
I'm good, Jae.

16:34.717 --> 16:37.039
- Randall, come on.
- Asked and answered, pal.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.585
I'm not gonna let this affect my work.

16:38.587 --> 16:39.721
Let's move on.

16:41.357 --> 16:43.991
- All right.
- All right.

16:51.534 --> 16:54.117
Your guy said you still
had an open-door policy.

16:54.119 --> 16:56.436
- You have a second?
- Yeah. Darnell.

16:56.438 --> 16:57.771
Please don't tell me

16:57.773 --> 16:59.940
Malik and Deja skipped school again.

16:59.942 --> 17:02.042
No, no, it's nothing
like that, Councilman.

17:02.044 --> 17:05.045
Uh-oh, he hit me with the honorific.

17:05.047 --> 17:06.781
This must be bad. Sit.

17:07.580 --> 17:10.672
Honorific. I like that.

17:10.674 --> 17:13.041
But no, it's-it's not
about the kids. Um...

17:15.257 --> 17:16.823
This is kind of awkward.

17:16.825 --> 17:18.592
I usually don't bother
myself with this stuff.

17:18.594 --> 17:20.894
I feel a strong "but" fast approaching.

17:20.896 --> 17:24.131
But... this housing bill.

17:24.133 --> 17:26.567
It has me and some of
the other business owners

17:26.569 --> 17:28.068
around my shop really concerned.

17:28.069 --> 17:30.470
If this thing goes through

17:30.472 --> 17:32.940
and they put those condos up,
they're gonna raise our rent.

17:32.942 --> 17:35.142
And that's gonna hurt a
lot of hard-working people.

17:37.213 --> 17:39.180
Sorry.

17:40.516 --> 17:42.182
You know, I'm only
here 'cause a few folks

17:42.184 --> 17:43.383
know our kids are close.

17:43.385 --> 17:45.220
- You know?
- Yeah, just one sec.

17:48.162 --> 17:51.320
Sorry, I'm just dealing
with something at home.

17:51.322 --> 17:54.127
You were talking about, uh...

17:54.129 --> 17:56.597
No, no, no. It's all good.

17:56.599 --> 17:58.131
We'll talk at the town hall.

17:58.133 --> 17:59.386
Maybe you'll listen then.

17:59.388 --> 18:00.934
Oh, no, hey, no. Sorry.

18:00.936 --> 18:03.238
Darnell, I...

18:18.487 --> 18:21.088
Next time, I get to pick the music.

18:21.090 --> 18:23.323
Nobody's trying to listen to Braveheart.

18:23.325 --> 18:26.460
Movie scores are stimulating
yet noninvasive study aids,

18:26.462 --> 18:27.985
unlike whatever noise you'd choose.

18:27.987 --> 18:30.373
Oh, don't pretend like you know
what kind of music I'd pick.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.532
- TLC FanMail.
- Lucky guess.

18:35.437 --> 18:37.971
All right, I'm gonna bounce.

18:37.973 --> 18:40.574
Finish studying on my
own and get some sleep.

18:40.576 --> 18:41.842
Oh.

18:41.844 --> 18:44.044
And tomorrow I'm bringing earplugs.

18:44.046 --> 18:47.114
Hey, do you mind staying the night?

18:47.116 --> 18:49.816
Randall, I've stayed
over almost every night.

18:49.818 --> 18:52.352
My roommates are starting
to call me "Mrs. Pearson".

18:52.354 --> 18:54.188
Hey, there are worse things.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.258
I'm just...

18:58.460 --> 19:00.295
I'm just not sleeping well.

19:01.964 --> 19:03.196
But, uh,

19:03.198 --> 19:05.133
not a big deal.

19:06.352 --> 19:08.568
Okay, Waiting to Exhale soundtrack

19:08.570 --> 19:10.316
from here on out, or
no movie music at all.

19:10.318 --> 19:11.418
Capisce?

19:13.809 --> 19:15.642
Okay.

19:15.644 --> 19:17.879
I'm gonna go grab some PJs.

19:31.860 --> 19:33.860
Hey, bud, why don't you grab a seat.

19:33.862 --> 19:35.696
Your food's getting cold.

19:35.698 --> 19:38.632
My boy. I can't believe
you guys got married.

19:38.634 --> 19:41.867
I'm so happy. Bec, we can
frame the Polaroids, right?

19:41.869 --> 19:42.886
- Yeah. We can try.
- Yeah?

19:42.888 --> 19:44.244
Hey, what are you guys doing?

19:44.246 --> 19:45.639
I'm-I'm sorry if

19:45.641 --> 19:47.174
the Cornish hens are a little tough.

19:47.176 --> 19:49.443
Somehow they're burnt and raw.

19:49.445 --> 19:51.511
Oh, Bec, come on,
this is... this is great.

19:51.513 --> 19:53.522
The whole family, everyone,
we're all together.

19:53.524 --> 19:56.683
- Everyone came back home.
- Hello? He's dead.

19:56.685 --> 19:59.486
Should we play Monopoly after dinner?

19:59.488 --> 20:01.188
- Yes.
- Yeah? Wait, what about Pictionary?

20:01.190 --> 20:03.157
- Oh, team captain.
- What the hell is going on?

20:03.159 --> 20:04.238
I'll flip you for first pick.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.859
Why are you guys talking
about board games?

20:05.861 --> 20:06.995
He's dead.

20:07.930 --> 20:09.596
Damn it, he's dead!

20:09.598 --> 20:11.198
He's dead! He's...

20:11.200 --> 20:13.967
You're dead. You're dead. You're dead.

20:13.969 --> 20:15.769
He's dead! He's dead!

20:15.771 --> 20:17.804
You're dead. You're dead.

20:17.806 --> 20:19.473
Randall?

20:19.475 --> 20:21.842
- You're dead. You're dead.
- Hey.

20:21.844 --> 20:23.977
- Hey, Randall...
- You're dead. You're dead.

20:23.979 --> 20:26.380
Okay, you okay?

20:26.382 --> 20:27.547
It's okay. I'm here.

20:27.549 --> 20:29.016
I'm here for you. It's okay.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.941
I'm here, Randall.

20:54.643 --> 20:56.476
Can't get this remote to work.

20:56.478 --> 20:58.279
And I forgot the security code.

20:59.314 --> 21:01.715
Randall, the code, babe.

21:01.717 --> 21:05.378
Uh, my parents' anniversary... 05-16-76.

21:05.380 --> 21:08.855
Okay. 16, seven, six.

21:08.857 --> 21:10.724
Oh, God. All right.

21:10.726 --> 21:13.093
Yeah, we're gonna have to change
that to our anniversary.

21:13.095 --> 21:14.594
So no one's here?

21:14.596 --> 21:16.363
No, babe, Annie just accidentally

21:16.365 --> 21:18.064
opened the window and set it off.

21:18.066 --> 21:19.933
It's the first day with
the security system.

21:19.935 --> 21:22.302
You know, it's just gonna
take some getting used to.

21:22.304 --> 21:23.804
Yeah.

21:25.441 --> 21:28.308
It's probably the security company now.

21:28.310 --> 21:30.477
Tell 'em it's a false alarm.

21:30.479 --> 21:31.978
Hello.

21:31.980 --> 21:34.315
Yes, this is Mrs. Pearson.

22:18.276 --> 22:20.276
Do we really need to have

22:20.278 --> 22:24.046
weapons everywhere like
we're Mr. and Mrs. Smith?

22:24.048 --> 22:26.415
You might want to rephrase that,

22:26.417 --> 22:28.718
'cause it actually sounds pretty cool.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.386
Yeah, you're right.

22:30.388 --> 22:32.054
But my point stands.

22:32.056 --> 22:33.779
You know, we are allowed to go back

22:33.781 --> 22:35.304
to our regularly-scheduled programming.

22:35.306 --> 22:38.511
The golf club shall return
to the trunk of my car.

22:38.513 --> 22:40.236
- Okay then.
- All right.

22:40.238 --> 22:44.796
Now the girls are gonna have dinner
at their friends' houses tonight.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.742
So, I'll meet you at
the town hall meeting?

22:46.744 --> 22:48.210
If you really want to go.

22:48.212 --> 22:50.434
- It could get heated.
- Yeah.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.959
All the more reason for
me to have your back.

22:52.961 --> 22:55.050
Plus, it gives me a
chance to stunt on 'em

22:55.052 --> 22:56.485
with my topaz earrings.

22:56.487 --> 22:58.321
Oh, I do love it when you stunt.

22:59.590 --> 23:01.290
That's odd.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.092
What's up?

23:03.094 --> 23:05.861
I usually keep my earrings
right next to my dance photo.

23:09.467 --> 23:12.067
They're not here, either.

23:12.069 --> 23:13.869
You're sure?

23:13.871 --> 23:15.938
I'm pretty sure.

23:15.940 --> 23:19.609
None of the jewelry from here
or on my nightstand is missing.

23:28.286 --> 23:32.122
Um... my cuff links were in here.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.972
I haven't touched them
since the inauguration.

23:37.828 --> 23:39.695
And they're missing.

23:39.697 --> 23:41.565
What?

23:43.968 --> 23:46.402
He just grabbed what was out.

23:46.404 --> 23:48.171
Beth, he stole 'em. He...

23:51.275 --> 23:53.866
- He was in our room.
- Okay, no, wait.

23:53.868 --> 23:55.139
Just relax,

23:55.141 --> 23:56.712
- because we don't know if that's true.
- No.

23:56.714 --> 23:57.837
I'm gonna go call the police

23:57.839 --> 24:00.282
- and have 'em over here right now.
- Oh.

24:01.719 --> 24:03.419
Ah, damn it.

24:03.421 --> 24:05.020
I should've had 'em dust upstairs.

24:05.022 --> 24:06.455
Okay. All right, call the police.

24:06.457 --> 24:08.058
But I need you to do something for me.

24:08.060 --> 24:09.728
- Hmm?
- Randall, I need you

24:09.730 --> 24:11.694
to acknowledge that
this week has been crazy.

24:11.696 --> 24:13.383
- Of course it was crazy.
- Randall, I want you

24:13.385 --> 24:15.531
to acknowledge that Rebecca's health,

24:15.533 --> 24:17.533
your trip to L.A., and the break-in...

24:17.535 --> 24:21.271
it's a lot... for anyone.

24:24.041 --> 24:26.626
Now, I know you're not
gonna cancel the town hall.

24:26.628 --> 24:29.011
- I can't cancel it.
- All right. Let...

24:29.013 --> 24:31.480
I'm gonna clear my schedule tomorrow,

24:31.482 --> 24:32.987
and you're gonna clear your schedule,

24:32.989 --> 24:35.150
and we're going to
have a real conversation

24:35.152 --> 24:36.986
about everything that's going on here

24:36.988 --> 24:38.788
and how to manage it together.

24:40.358 --> 24:42.091
If I have to body-slam Jae-won

24:42.093 --> 24:43.827
to get you out of work, I will.

24:48.332 --> 24:50.700
Okay.

25:03.648 --> 25:05.581
You ran as a man of the people.

25:05.583 --> 25:06.982
Now, what makes you think

25:06.984 --> 25:09.367
the people support
Wilkins' housing bill?

25:11.489 --> 25:13.455
Uh, I-I realize that

25:13.457 --> 25:16.925
revitalizing neighborhoods
can have pluses and minuses.

25:16.927 --> 25:18.794
Uh, yes or no?

25:18.796 --> 25:21.185
Are you gonna pay for the rent increase

25:21.187 --> 25:24.800
for my salon when Wilkins builds
his luxury condo next door?

25:24.802 --> 25:26.902
Okay. Okay.

25:26.904 --> 25:29.542
Um, listen, uh,

25:29.544 --> 25:31.840
a New York study actually shows

25:31.842 --> 25:34.209
that a lot of small businesses thrive

25:34.211 --> 25:36.088
with the influx of disposable income.

25:36.090 --> 25:38.013
Yeah, and what about
the ones that don't?

25:38.015 --> 25:40.372
Ma'am, if you could wait for
the microphone to come around.

25:40.374 --> 25:42.985
Uh... sorry. Listen,

25:42.987 --> 25:45.754
I'm happy to hear from everyone.
If you could please just...

25:45.756 --> 25:47.824
Uh...

25:49.927 --> 25:52.161
Look, uh...

25:52.163 --> 25:54.663
I can assure you, uh...

25:54.665 --> 25:56.131
I said, what about

25:56.133 --> 25:57.900
the ones that don't?

25:57.902 --> 26:00.003
Yes. Yes.

26:10.881 --> 26:12.482
Um...

26:14.652 --> 26:16.652
Uh...

26:16.654 --> 26:18.821
I can assure you

26:18.823 --> 26:22.600
that the housing bill will
take all of your concerns

26:22.602 --> 26:23.959
into account.

26:23.961 --> 26:26.995
Okay? There are caps on rent hikes

26:26.997 --> 26:29.198
and programs to make sure that

26:29.200 --> 26:33.635
bodegas and salons and all
businesses continue to succeed.

26:33.637 --> 26:35.571
Uh...

26:35.573 --> 26:39.608
Listen, I wouldn't support this
bill unless I believed in it

26:39.610 --> 26:43.880
and believed that it was
good for our district.

26:44.915 --> 26:46.916
I need you to trust me.

26:49.220 --> 26:51.253
Trust me.

27:49.514 --> 27:51.280
Hey.

27:51.282 --> 27:53.694
Still can't believe those
town hall people tried

27:53.696 --> 27:55.305
to come for you crazy yesterday.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.040
That's what I signed up for.

28:00.056 --> 28:02.246
You know you can adjust the settings

28:02.248 --> 28:04.848
on that security app,
make it less sensitive

28:04.850 --> 28:06.383
and less distracting.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.310
No, it's all good. Kind
of like that I get notified

28:09.312 --> 28:11.688
every time a maple leaf
falls by the camera.

28:11.690 --> 28:15.550
All right, well, I'm gonna
drop the girls off at school,

28:15.552 --> 28:17.761
- and then I'm coming right back.
- Uh-huh.

28:17.763 --> 28:19.329
Your schedule's still cleared, yeah?

28:19.331 --> 28:20.664
We're gonna have this talk?

28:20.666 --> 28:22.644
I'm still on board for the talk.

28:22.646 --> 28:24.526
Should we get a red table?

28:24.528 --> 28:26.285
Invite Jada and Gammy?

28:26.287 --> 28:28.443
- Yeah. It's cute.
- I'll see you after my run.

28:28.445 --> 28:29.866
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

28:29.868 --> 28:31.161
Don't dawdle.

28:31.163 --> 28:32.796
Girl, I ain't scared of you.

28:35.133 --> 28:37.401
Bah-bah, bah-bah-bah.

28:38.670 --> 28:40.570
Hey, Darnell.

28:40.572 --> 28:43.373
- What a... what a surprise, man.
- What's up?

28:43.375 --> 28:45.079
Yeah, I had a-a day off.

28:45.081 --> 28:46.276
Thought I'd stop by.

28:46.278 --> 28:48.396
Listen, about what
happened in the office...

28:48.398 --> 28:51.214
- I-I never meant to offend...
- I'm not here to talk about that.

28:51.216 --> 28:53.918
Malik told me about the break-in.

28:55.954 --> 28:58.621
Oh. Uh...

28:58.623 --> 29:01.691
Yeah, I was wondering why you
were so quiet at the town hall.

29:01.693 --> 29:03.359
Thought you was gonna light me up.

29:03.361 --> 29:04.794
I was planning to.

29:04.796 --> 29:06.563
Had a whole list of questions.

29:06.565 --> 29:08.698
Kelly added some heavy hitters,
too. You know she don't play.

29:08.700 --> 29:11.135
Yeah.

29:12.170 --> 29:14.170
I don't know, man.

29:14.172 --> 29:16.406
Some dude breaks into my house

29:16.408 --> 29:18.274
where my wife and kids are sleeping,

29:18.276 --> 29:20.777
I would've lost it. I'd be a mess.

29:20.779 --> 29:23.079
Yeah.

29:23.081 --> 29:25.648
I run.

29:25.650 --> 29:27.050
- From the dude? No shame.
- No.

29:27.052 --> 29:28.785
No... I, uh...

29:28.787 --> 29:30.753
I mean, I go for long runs.

29:30.755 --> 29:33.089
You know, get the blood
flowing, heart pumping,

29:33.091 --> 29:34.958
adrenaline rushing.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.293
That's always been how I, uh...

29:37.295 --> 29:39.729
how I get over it, you know?

29:39.731 --> 29:41.331
Regain my composure.

29:41.333 --> 29:43.733
You, um...

29:43.735 --> 29:46.189
you didn't seem too composed

29:46.191 --> 29:49.183
last night at the town hall or
in your office the other day.

29:49.185 --> 29:52.675
Do you do anything else besides running?

29:52.677 --> 29:55.078
- I was thinking of a Peloton.
- No, no, no.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.647
No, I mean, like, uh...

29:57.649 --> 29:59.782
do you go to therapy?

29:59.784 --> 30:02.252
It's made a big difference with me.

30:02.254 --> 30:05.121
I don't. You go to therapy?

30:05.123 --> 30:07.751
Look, clearly you're an agitated cat.

30:07.753 --> 30:10.126
- Uh...
- I used to be, too. You know,

30:10.128 --> 30:12.128
and there's certain things you
can't talk to your girl about.

30:12.130 --> 30:13.696
Oh, I can talk to Beth about anything.

30:13.698 --> 30:15.665
Can I finish?

30:15.667 --> 30:17.500
Yeah.

30:21.239 --> 30:23.439
About ten years back,

30:23.441 --> 30:25.341
there was this Easter service.

30:25.343 --> 30:28.144
Malik fell getting out the
car, split his pants open,

30:28.146 --> 30:31.447
so Kelly had to take him
back home early, but I stayed.

30:31.449 --> 30:34.617
I noticed a bunch of
hymn books on the floor.

30:34.619 --> 30:36.819
So I helped Pastor James pick 'em up.

30:36.821 --> 30:40.990
Next thing I know, I
spilled my guts to him.

30:40.992 --> 30:44.794
About Kelly, work, money, everything.

30:44.796 --> 30:48.631
And from then on, every Sunday
after church let out at 1:00,

30:48.633 --> 30:51.234
there I was helping Pastor
James pick up hymn books,

30:51.236 --> 30:54.037
looking for a talk.

30:54.039 --> 30:56.005
Eventually he got sick of my ass

30:56.007 --> 30:58.341
getting free counseling sessions.

30:58.343 --> 31:01.277
One day, he hands me
this manila envelope.

31:01.279 --> 31:03.546
I think he's handing me divorce papers.

31:03.548 --> 31:06.367
But, um, Dr. Freeman's
business card was inside.

31:06.369 --> 31:08.477
You're not about to hand
me an envelope, are you?

31:08.479 --> 31:10.086
No.

31:10.088 --> 31:12.989
I'm sure you can find someone
who doesn't use a sliding scale.

31:12.991 --> 31:15.192
That's funny.

31:17.295 --> 31:19.696
Look, bro, I get it.

31:19.698 --> 31:22.699
Us men of a certain shade,

31:22.701 --> 31:26.370
we're not used to talking.

31:27.405 --> 31:29.872
But that's therapy, right?

31:29.874 --> 31:31.441
Talking.

31:31.443 --> 31:33.876
It doesn't always have to be that deep.

31:33.878 --> 31:37.715
You can just talk about everyday stuff.

31:41.319 --> 31:42.752
Hey.

31:42.754 --> 31:46.256
I, uh, I appreciate the offer, Darnell.

31:46.258 --> 31:49.659
But, uh, I'm well aware
of what my issues are.

31:49.661 --> 31:51.194
All right?

31:51.196 --> 31:53.696
Running suits me just fine.

31:53.698 --> 31:56.466
Speaking of which, uh...

31:56.468 --> 31:58.501
Thanks for the chat.

31:58.503 --> 31:59.936
Don't mention it.

31:59.938 --> 32:01.605
All right.

32:02.607 --> 32:04.407
You don't have to be embarrassed.

32:04.409 --> 32:07.277
- I'm not.
- Okay, then tell me about your dreams.

32:07.279 --> 32:09.480
How long have they been happening?

32:11.549 --> 32:15.119
O-Off and on since
my... since my dad died.

32:16.521 --> 32:19.156
I guess the fire alarm
made things worse.

32:21.192 --> 32:23.693
It's not like watching
a movie or anything.

32:23.695 --> 32:25.296
I can't remember all the details.

32:27.565 --> 32:29.565
I just feel so helpless.

32:29.567 --> 32:31.735
Like I have no control over anything.

32:34.773 --> 32:36.906
It's stupid.

32:36.908 --> 32:38.908
No, Randall.

32:38.910 --> 32:41.412
That's not even close to stupid.

32:43.148 --> 32:46.150
I had the worst dreams
after my dad died.

32:48.219 --> 32:50.186
They always involved choking.

32:50.188 --> 32:51.788
Lack of oxygen.

32:51.790 --> 32:54.190
- Lung cancer?
- Right.

32:54.192 --> 32:56.192
It seems so obvious now,

32:56.194 --> 32:59.195
but it didn't to me at the time.

32:59.197 --> 33:01.964
Not until I talked to someone.

33:01.966 --> 33:05.535
I learned to tell myself
that they're just dreams.

33:05.537 --> 33:07.837
It gave me control.

33:07.839 --> 33:09.405
And now...

33:09.407 --> 33:12.242
the dreams about my dad are good.

33:13.411 --> 33:15.812
They're happy.

33:15.814 --> 33:20.116
They make me feel like I'm creating

33:20.118 --> 33:21.919
new memories of him.

33:23.321 --> 33:25.321
You can do that, too.

33:25.323 --> 33:27.824
Just talk to someone.

33:27.826 --> 33:29.125
Like a counselor or...

33:29.127 --> 33:31.794
I-I don't know if that's my thing.

33:31.796 --> 33:34.364
Well, then, how about grief group?

33:34.366 --> 33:36.199
They have one on the weekends.

33:36.201 --> 33:39.718
I-I went a couple times
when I first got to school.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.743
Now, I could go with you tomorrow

33:41.745 --> 33:43.272
before your mom's dinner.

33:43.274 --> 33:46.275
It's better than torturing yourself.

33:46.277 --> 33:48.444
Trust me.

34:10.402 --> 34:12.235
Stop!

34:12.237 --> 34:14.003
Oh! Stop!

34:14.005 --> 34:16.239
Please! Stop! Stop!

34:17.675 --> 34:20.577
Get the hell off me, man!

34:44.963 --> 34:46.929
Daddy.

34:46.931 --> 34:49.297
Bud,

34:49.300 --> 34:52.935
I promise I scared
all the monsters away.

34:52.937 --> 34:54.724
And because they know
that you're my son,

34:54.726 --> 34:56.659
now they're afraid of you, too.

34:58.663 --> 35:02.644
Look, I'm, I'm gonna be
honest with you, Randall.

35:02.646 --> 35:04.300
Your-your brother and your sister

35:04.302 --> 35:06.302
are kind of high-maintenance, so...

35:06.304 --> 35:08.571
so I need you to just keep being you.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.896
Because if you go south,

35:10.898 --> 35:14.344
well, Mom and Dad, we
don't stand a chance.

35:14.346 --> 35:18.449
So can you be a good boy and
sleep in your bed tonight?

35:20.352 --> 35:23.853
Okay. Way to be brave,
my strong, little man.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.256
I love you.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.935
It's a minor break in
the fifth metacarpal.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.937
Boxer's fracture.

35:40.939 --> 35:43.573
Are you all right?

35:43.575 --> 35:45.842
He'll have this cast on for a few weeks,

35:45.844 --> 35:48.311
but everything else
checks out just fine.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.113
Hate to see the other guy.

35:50.115 --> 35:52.383
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

35:54.619 --> 35:56.920
Jae-won told me what happened.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.781
He said someone named Amadeus Cho

35:58.783 --> 36:00.056
is handling the situation.

36:00.058 --> 36:03.294
I-I don't know what that means,
but he sounded confident.

36:06.865 --> 36:10.633
And the woman... uh,
the one that you saved,

36:10.635 --> 36:12.670
she's calling you a hero.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.207
You're a hero, baby.

36:18.743 --> 36:20.210
I'm really tired.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.145
Yeah, okay, all right.

36:22.147 --> 36:25.115
Let's get you out of here.

36:43.969 --> 36:46.437
Baby...

36:51.843 --> 36:54.244
Okay.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.180
Get some rest.

37:37.137 --> 37:41.659
_

37:41.661 --> 37:46.162
_

37:53.471 --> 37:56.231
Come on. The last thing I
want to do is catch grief

37:56.233 --> 37:57.407
for being late to a grief group.

37:57.409 --> 38:00.840
Good, get all your wack jokes
out of your system now.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.117
- Hello.
- Hey, man.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.827
Kev. Hold up. I-I'm coming
home to Mom's dinner,

38:10.829 --> 38:12.956
uh, but I'm heading
to something right now, so...

38:12.958 --> 38:14.457
Mom canceled her birthday dinner.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.558
Wait, why?

38:15.560 --> 38:16.743
Something's wrong with Kate.

38:16.745 --> 38:18.336
Um, I'll explain in the car.

38:18.338 --> 38:19.928
Just be ready in 20. We're
coming to pick you up.

38:19.930 --> 38:21.364
- All right?
- O-Okay.

38:21.366 --> 38:23.534
I-I'll be downstairs.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.704
Uh, is everything okay?

38:27.706 --> 38:30.640
I am so sorry.

38:30.642 --> 38:34.377
Uh, family emergency. Dinner's canceled.

38:34.379 --> 38:37.704
- I'm gonna have to skip the grief group.
- Okay, Ran...

38:37.706 --> 38:39.161
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh.

38:39.163 --> 38:41.752
Um, oka-okay.

38:45.924 --> 38:48.591
How's the guy? Uh, the purse snatcher.

38:48.593 --> 38:51.205
Uh, he's just got, like,
a small orbital fracture.

38:51.207 --> 38:53.329
Nothing too serious.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.865
It's been an insane week.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.835
You ready for this?

38:58.837 --> 39:00.436
Yeah.

39:16.287 --> 39:17.854
Way to go, Councilman.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.790
How does it feel to be a hero?

39:23.662 --> 39:25.996
Um...

40:26.758 --> 40:28.758
Hey, Randall.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.393
Hey, Kev.

40:30.395 --> 40:34.597
Uh... I lied, man.

40:34.599 --> 40:38.634
I need a catch. Uh...

40:38.636 --> 40:41.638
I'm not okay.

40:44.909 --> 40:46.542
I'm not okay, man.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.011
I, uh...

40:49.781 --> 40:51.581
He had a knife.

40:51.583 --> 40:54.450
He was in my bedroom, Kevin.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.285
He could've done something to Beth.

40:56.287 --> 40:59.055
He could've done something
to my girls. He could have...

40:59.057 --> 41:00.256
Okay, okay.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.058
Hey, hey, listen, I'm here, all right?

41:02.060 --> 41:06.462
I'm here. Just breathe, Randall, okay?

41:06.464 --> 41:08.264
Just breathe.

41:08.266 --> 41:10.133
We can just sit here
on the phone together.

41:10.135 --> 41:11.534
All right? Whatever you want.

41:11.536 --> 41:15.037
I just... I just, um...

41:15.039 --> 41:17.507
I just... I just needed to talk, okay?

41:17.509 --> 41:19.509
I just... Say something, anything.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.144
I just need you to talk, yeah?

41:21.146 --> 41:22.978
Of course, okay. Yeah,
no, I'll-I'll talk.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.403
I can talk. I'm...

41:24.405 --> 41:26.172
I'm good at that.

41:27.952 --> 41:30.953
I'm gonna be that guy, Randall. Okay?

41:30.955 --> 41:33.724
I'm the guy that's gonna
get you through this.

41:46.771 --> 41:50.740
Oh. Jesus, Kevin.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.742
Please don't say "redrum".

41:52.744 --> 41:55.746
I can't sleep.

41:56.870 --> 41:59.694
Actually, you're kind
of doing me a favor

41:59.696 --> 42:00.952
listening to me right now.

42:00.954 --> 42:04.120
You know, I'm kind of in
the middle of a whole thing.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.624
It's been a hell of a week.
