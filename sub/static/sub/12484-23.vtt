00:09.050 --> 00:12.060
Ugh, this backpack is so heavy.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.200
My back is killing me!

00:15.840 --> 00:17.880
Okay, I think my back is stuck this way.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.080
What do you have in there, a ton of bricks?

00:21.120 --> 00:23.860
Yes.

00:23.890 --> 00:27.130
<i>A Ton of Bricks</i>
<i>by Kathleen Lombard.</i>

00:30.230 --> 00:31.930
Hey...

00:31.970 --> 00:34.000
You know what would be awesome?

00:34.040 --> 00:35.070
Calculus camp?

00:36.970 --> 00:38.000
No.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.110
If books had feet and legs.

00:40.140 --> 00:44.980
Then they could walk to school
with you and carry your backpack.

00:45.010 --> 00:48.980
Or how about a backpack that massages
your back while you're wearing it?

00:49.010 --> 00:52.920
Well, your idea doesn't require
breeding a race of walking books

00:52.950 --> 00:54.950
that could one day rise up and use
the knowledge contained within them

00:54.990 --> 00:56.020
to rise against us.

00:58.060 --> 01:00.060
Think about it.

01:00.090 --> 01:02.960
Not that crazy thing you just said.
My idea.

01:04.900 --> 01:08.970
We could make a billion dollars
with a massaging backpack!

01:09.010 --> 01:13.040
With a billion dollars, we could buy a
billion things from the Dollar Store!

01:13.080 --> 01:17.180
Or one billion, ten million, one hundred
and one thousand and ten things

01:17.220 --> 01:18.950
from the 99 Cent Store.

01:21.050 --> 01:23.150
You cannot tell a soul about this.

01:23.190 --> 01:26.090
We don't want anyone else
horning in on our idea.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.960
What about Chyna?
We should at least include her.

01:27.990 --> 01:28.990
No way.

01:29.030 --> 01:30.930
Every business book I've ever read

01:30.960 --> 01:33.230
says you should never do
business with friends.

01:33.270 --> 01:34.930
But you're going in on this with me.

01:34.970 --> 01:35.970
Exactly.

02:32.270 --> 02:35.870
Hey, everyone, I got a new outfit.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.010
Don't miss this photo op!

02:40.080 --> 02:43.210
Gibson, why is no one looking at me?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.110
Huh! Maybe you're dead.

02:45.150 --> 02:47.920
I see dead people!

02:49.050 --> 02:50.090
I'm not dead.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.060
I see living people, too!

02:55.260 --> 02:58.200
Wait a second!

02:58.230 --> 03:00.000
Is that Paisley
around? E's gathering.

03:00.030 --> 03:02.130
She broke her arm last night.

03:02.170 --> 03:04.140
That is just like Paisley

03:04.170 --> 03:06.140
to break a limb
away from me. Ntion.

03:08.910 --> 03:13.010
Okay, I designed
massaging backpack. ur

03:13.050 --> 03:14.050
I give you...

03:15.950 --> 03:17.080
The Fletch Pack!

03:20.090 --> 03:21.990
Or Olive Pack.
Olive Pack is good.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.190
Let me try it on.

03:29.970 --> 03:30.970
Ooh!

03:33.900 --> 03:35.170
Ah!

03:39.240 --> 03:42.210
It has Swedish mode, Shiatsu mode, and...

03:45.180 --> 03:46.990
Apple pie a la mode.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.090
Nice!

03:50.120 --> 03:51.260
Hey, what's this do?

03:52.260 --> 03:54.290
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

03:57.960 --> 03:58.030
Slap mode!

04:00.930 --> 04:02.200
It also has a vibrating massage

04:02.240 --> 04:04.170
for an all-over
relaxation experience!

04:04.200 --> 04:06.240
Ooh!

04:07.240 --> 04:09.170
Ah!

04:09.210 --> 04:12.210
I like this one.

04:12.240 --> 04:15.110
It feels good!

04:17.950 --> 04:20.850
Hey, Lexi, can you move?
I want to sign Paisley's cast.

04:20.890 --> 04:21.950
Excuse me.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.960
Chyna's coming!
Quick, hide the backpack!

04:27.260 --> 04:30.060
I can't get it off!

04:30.100 --> 04:30.460
Angus' hoodie!

04:30.500 --> 04:32.230
Yeah. Yeah.

04:38.010 --> 04:38.970
Hey, guys.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.070
What are you up to?

04:44.250 --> 04:46.010
Nothing.

04:46.050 --> 04:49.980
Just hanging out with my bud, Olive.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.120
Ooh!

04:52.150 --> 04:53.920
Hi, Chyna.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.030
Olive, are you okay?

04:59.060 --> 05:03.930
Yeah. I'm just
a little chilly.

05:04.900 --> 05:10.140
Yeah, why do you think she's
wearing this oversized hoodie?

05:10.170 --> 05:13.970
I mean, it's not like she's
trying to hide something.

05:14.010 --> 05:17.010
You guys have been acting
strange since yesterday.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.150
Whispering to each other, giggling,

05:20.980 --> 05:23.180
acting all weird when I enter the room.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.990
Wait a second.

05:25.020 --> 05:28.860
I know why you've been acting strange.

05:28.890 --> 05:30.090
You do?
You do?

05:31.190 --> 05:33.200
You two

05:33.230 --> 05:35.100
are secretly dating!

05:36.900 --> 05:37.930
Um...

05:38.270 --> 05:41.170
You caught us!

05:41.200 --> 05:44.970
I find this immature, little
weirdo totally irresistible.

05:47.910 --> 05:51.110
And Olive's endless babbling
about nothing is so adorable.

05:51.150 --> 05:54.150
Interesting factoid.
I love her.

05:55.280 --> 05:55.980
Oh, you guys!

06:06.230 --> 06:07.890
Hey, Paisley.

06:08.960 --> 06:09.900
Oh!

06:12.900 --> 06:15.000
I'm sure you're bummed
about your broken arm.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.140
Hey! You know what
always cheers me up?

06:17.170 --> 06:18.870
Butter skating!

06:18.910 --> 06:20.140
I brought you a pair!

06:20.180 --> 06:23.240
But you're gonna have to
find your own hair helmet.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.180
Hello, students.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.890
I would wave to you, but I can't
because I have two broken arms.

06:33.990 --> 06:36.020
Don't cry for me, Marge and Tina.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.230
But you can sign my casts!

06:41.260 --> 06:43.930
Did I mention I have two of them,

06:43.970 --> 06:45.970
which is twice as many as Paisley has?

06:48.100 --> 06:48.940
Lexi, how did you break your arms?

06:51.040 --> 06:53.010
It doesn't matter how.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.210
The important thing is how many.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.910
Two.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.150
Can I sign your cast?

06:59.180 --> 07:01.110
I love what you wrote on mine.

07:01.150 --> 07:06.890
"Hope infection sets in.
Love, Lexi."

07:06.920 --> 07:08.920
Oh, that's just like you.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.020
Full of hope!

07:10.060 --> 07:12.930
Hey. Be careful walking
down here, Lexi.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.030
We wouldn't want you to get more hurt.

07:15.060 --> 07:18.000
For some reason the floor's all buttery.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.970
I'll help you with my one good arm, Lexi.

07:24.910 --> 07:26.910
Paisley, are you okay?

07:26.940 --> 07:30.010
I think I broke my other
arm and one of my legs.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.010
You've got to be kidding me!

07:36.080 --> 07:37.150
That's sweet of you to wish it was a joke,

07:37.180 --> 07:40.050
but I'm afraid it's true, friend.

07:42.150 --> 07:43.990
It's my fault!

07:44.020 --> 07:47.090
I forgot to put out the
"Caution, Caution Sign" sign.

07:54.130 --> 07:56.200
What!

07:56.240 --> 07:58.040
Lunch just started!
How could the fudge pops already be gone?

08:00.210 --> 08:04.080
I used them to design
our new company's building.

08:04.110 --> 08:05.180
I give you.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.910
Fletch Tower!

08:10.050 --> 08:12.120
Or Olive Tower.
Olive Tower's good.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.160
There are my two favorite sweethearts!

08:17.190 --> 08:19.090
Actually, the heart is not sweet,

08:19.130 --> 08:21.930
but rather quite bitter due to
the presence of oxidized blood.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.100
She's all mine.

08:26.140 --> 08:29.870
Oh, you guys are so cute together!

08:29.910 --> 08:29.940
Let me get a picture of you guys.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.070
Sure.
I guess.

08:34.010 --> 08:34.909
Okay.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.850
Oh, come on!

08:39.880 --> 08:41.919
How about a smooch?

08:51.890 --> 08:53.900
I can't do it!

08:53.930 --> 08:57.100
I'd rather lose half a billion
dollars than kiss Fletcher.

08:57.130 --> 08:58.000
What?
What's going on?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And half a billion dollars?

09:02.040 --> 09:03.100
Okay. This is not another scheme
to take down Vegas, is it?

09:03.140 --> 09:04.910
Because they know your faces now.

09:07.210 --> 09:09.940
The truth is we came up with an idea

09:09.980 --> 09:11.850
to invent a massaging backpack

09:11.880 --> 09:14.050
after watching you struggle with yours.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.820
Well, why would you guys lie to me?

09:16.850 --> 09:17.950
Because I knew you'd want to be part of it

09:17.990 --> 09:21.060
and business can really hurt a friendship.

09:21.090 --> 09:22.160
Let me illustrate.

09:22.190 --> 09:24.930
Let's say my hand represents business.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.860
And Fletcher represents friendship.

09:26.900 --> 09:26.930
Ow!

09:29.060 --> 09:31.930
See?

09:31.970 --> 09:32.930
Let me use another example.

09:32.970 --> 09:34.900
Let's say this fork represents business.

09:34.940 --> 09:36.140
She gets it!
She gets it!

09:38.940 --> 09:41.980
Okay. I would never let
anything hurt our friendship.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.880
I really want to work with you guys.

09:43.910 --> 09:45.980
It'll be so fun.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.220
Well, if you think you can handle it,

09:47.250 --> 09:49.850
welcome aboard.

09:49.890 --> 09:50.890
Yes!
Yes!

09:50.920 --> 09:52.860
And just to be clear,

09:52.890 --> 09:56.930
that thing about Olive and me
dating was entirely made up.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.060
I'm totally available.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.160
Well, you guys fooled me.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.170
I was completely convinced
you were a couple.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.130
Ew!

10:06.170 --> 10:07.900
You didn't go spreading
that around, did you?

10:08.240 --> 10:08.940
Uh...

10:10.240 --> 10:11.910
No.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.010
No, I did not.

10:15.210 --> 10:19.050
Quimby, I challenge you

10:19.080 --> 10:19.980
to a duel!

10:22.220 --> 10:27.530
Fletcher, Olive is mine.
All mine!

10:33.630 --> 10:36.340
All right, first item on the agenda.

10:36.370 --> 10:40.710
I am pleased to announce that we have
chosen our employee of the month.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.380
Hey, guys!
Look what I have!

10:46.420 --> 10:47.820
Balloons?

10:47.850 --> 10:50.450
We're throwing a party to celebrate
me getting employee of the month?

10:52.560 --> 10:56.490
No. This is our invention.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.690
Uh, we already have an invention.

10:57.730 --> 11:00.700
The massaging backpack.

11:00.730 --> 11:04.270
Yeah, but why treat the
symptoms of a heavy backpack

11:04.300 --> 11:06.340
when we can remove the problem entirely

11:06.370 --> 11:07.400
by making the backpack weightless?

11:09.510 --> 11:11.470
That's a great idea!

11:11.510 --> 11:14.580
The helium in the balloons counteract
the weight of the backpack.

11:14.610 --> 11:17.580
How did you get employee of the
month and not this young go-getter?

11:20.450 --> 11:25.290
Look, Chyna, my massaging
backpack idea is already perfect.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.420
Balloons are totally impractical.

11:26.460 --> 11:28.490
Look how easy they pop.

11:33.630 --> 11:36.330
Wow.

11:36.370 --> 11:37.700
Someone should invent a fork sharpener.

11:39.410 --> 11:40.670
You know what?
Let's vote.

11:40.710 --> 11:44.510
Who would rather do Chyna's terrible idea

11:44.540 --> 11:46.610
than my great idea?

11:48.410 --> 11:50.580
I vote for my idea.

11:50.620 --> 11:52.320
Me, too.

11:52.350 --> 11:53.250
Fletcher?

11:53.290 --> 11:57.420
Sorry, Olive.
Chyna's idea is better.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.330
Besides, you know I love anything
that comes with balloons.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.430
Except clowns.

12:01.460 --> 12:02.690
I hate clowns.

12:02.730 --> 12:05.630
When I see a clown with balloons,
I feel very conflicted.

12:08.570 --> 12:12.440
Sorry, Olive, but it's two against one.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.540
Well, we'll see about that.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.580
Hey, Angus, I have a proposal for you.

12:20.610 --> 12:22.280
The answer is yes!

12:22.310 --> 12:24.320
A thousand times, yes!

12:40.370 --> 12:42.440
I didn't mean a marriage proposal.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.400
I meant a business proposal.

12:46.540 --> 12:48.680
Duh. I knew that.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.350
Do not release the doves.

13:02.560 --> 13:06.290
Thanks so much for carrying
my books for me, Paisley.

13:06.330 --> 13:10.460
I'm just so exhausted from having two
broken arms and two broken legs.

13:11.570 --> 13:13.600
No problem, Lexi.

13:13.630 --> 13:16.440
So, you were hit by a plane?

13:17.540 --> 13:19.310
How did that happen?

13:19.340 --> 13:21.570
I was doing some fashion modeling.

13:21.610 --> 13:24.340
They really shouldn't
call them both runways.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.520
Hey, guys!
I was down in the basement

13:28.550 --> 13:30.420
like I am every Wednesday,
feeding the rats,

13:30.450 --> 13:33.520
and I found this cool armoire.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.560
It's perfect to keep my rat food in!

13:35.590 --> 13:38.660
Oh! But boy, is this
thing hard to move!

13:38.700 --> 13:40.600
Even with the dolly.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.630
What dolly?
I don't see a dolly.

13:42.670 --> 13:43.700
It's right under here.

13:50.540 --> 13:51.710
Paisley, are you okay?

13:54.710 --> 13:56.680
I'm all right.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.380
I just think I broke everything.

14:01.420 --> 14:05.490
You're so selfish!

14:05.520 --> 14:06.520
I've had it!

14:08.630 --> 14:10.290
Sorry!

14:11.290 --> 14:13.630
This is my fault.

14:13.660 --> 14:16.630
I forgot to put out my "Caution,
Falling Armoires" sign.

14:24.340 --> 14:27.580
Olive, you just invited Angus in
so he would vote for your ideas.

14:27.610 --> 14:28.480
He agrees with everything you say.

14:28.510 --> 14:33.350
That's not true.
That's not true.

14:33.380 --> 14:37.320
Anyway, I have a new design for the weightless
backpack I'd like to show everyone.

14:37.350 --> 14:38.650
Not so fast.

14:38.690 --> 14:40.360
I have my own prototype.

14:40.390 --> 14:41.460
Let's see them both and vote.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.030
Fine.

14:44.060 --> 14:45.530
Then, without further ado,

14:45.560 --> 14:49.370
because I think we'll agree
we've all had enough ado,

14:49.400 --> 14:50.470
I present

14:51.370 --> 14:53.440
the Inflate-A-Pack!

14:55.470 --> 14:56.670
Okay.

15:03.650 --> 15:05.450
Impressive.

15:05.490 --> 15:11.260
But you know, as much as
your design appeals to me,

15:11.290 --> 15:13.360
something's telling me not to vote for it.

15:13.390 --> 15:14.660
Do not vote for it.

15:18.300 --> 15:19.500
Okay, my design.

15:19.530 --> 15:22.500
Now, I'm sure you're probably all aware

15:22.540 --> 15:25.300
that bats can carry up to
three times their body weight.

15:26.340 --> 15:28.310
So, I present to you.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.380
The Bat Sack!

15:33.380 --> 15:36.280
Is there a bat in that bag?

15:36.320 --> 15:38.380
Of course not!
There are two dozen bats in this bag.

15:41.450 --> 15:44.290
Olive, that's a crazy idea!

15:44.320 --> 15:46.490
People are going to carry
around a bag of bats?

15:46.530 --> 15:48.360
What are the bats even going to eat?

15:50.430 --> 15:51.460
My neck!

15:51.500 --> 15:53.430
Get it off!
Get it off!

15:56.600 --> 16:00.510
Well, now would be a good time to vote.

16:09.790 --> 16:11.760
Now that we've chosen the backpack design

16:11.790 --> 16:13.730
that does not drain a human
of precious blood...

16:15.960 --> 16:17.660
So cold.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.900
I think we should do an infomercial.

16:21.930 --> 16:23.970
How are we supposed to
pay for an infomercial?

16:25.770 --> 16:26.710
Oh, this backpack is so heavy!

16:30.010 --> 16:31.940
When I won <i>America Needs Talent,</i>

16:31.980 --> 16:34.810
why did I ask for the $100,000 in nickels?

16:38.680 --> 16:41.990
Gibson, how would you like
to invest in a product

16:42.020 --> 16:44.790
that's guaranteed to
make a billion dollars?

16:44.820 --> 16:48.890
More money? No! Money is the worst.
It's so heavy!

16:50.700 --> 16:52.000
Okay. Well, then,

16:52.030 --> 16:54.700
how would you like to
pay for our infomercial

16:54.740 --> 16:55.870
and get nothing back in return?

16:55.900 --> 16:57.040
That sounds awesome!

16:58.910 --> 17:01.910
But I want to star in the infomercial.

17:01.940 --> 17:04.710
It's been a dream of mine ever since you
said the word infomercial five seconds ago.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.650
Totally.
No problem.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.680
Okay.
Not so fast.

17:11.750 --> 17:12.690
I don't agree.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.790
Oh, why don't you agree?

17:14.819 --> 17:15.960
Why don't you agree?
Oh, I do agree.

17:15.990 --> 17:17.990
No, you don't.

17:18.030 --> 17:20.660
This is about us rejecting your Bat Sack.

17:20.700 --> 17:20.730
No, it's not.

17:22.030 --> 17:22.800
You seem upset.

17:22.829 --> 17:24.760
I'm not upset.
You're upset.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.030
Okay. I am upset.
No, you're not.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.740
Okay, I kind of feel like whatever I say,

17:31.770 --> 17:32.940
you're just saying the
opposite to disagree with me.

17:32.970 --> 17:33.940
No, I'm not.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.780
Up... Happy...
Down... Sad...

17:36.810 --> 17:37.940
Not.
Not not.

17:40.950 --> 17:41.910
You know what?
Forget this.

17:41.950 --> 17:44.920
No, I'm going to remember this.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.820
What? I have an eidetic memory.
I'm going to remember this.

17:52.860 --> 17:55.990
CHYN <i>Are you sick and tired</i>
<i>of old-fashioned backpacks</i>

17:56.030 --> 17:58.000
<i>that are impossible</i>
<i>to figure out?</i>

18:02.970 --> 18:06.000
<i>With their</i>
<i>dangerous zippers!</i>

18:10.910 --> 18:14.810
<i>To say nothing</i> <i>of their
back-breaking</i> <i>weight!</i>

18:17.020 --> 18:19.690
<i>Well, say goodbye</i> <i>to all that</i>

18:19.720 --> 18:22.920
<i>with the new</i>
<i>from AntCo! Ack</i>

18:25.860 --> 18:28.760
<i>With our patented</i>
<i>air pillow technology,</i>

18:28.800 --> 18:31.630
<i>a weight will be lifted</i>
<i>off your shoulders.</i>

18:31.670 --> 18:32.930
<i>Literally!</i>

18:32.970 --> 18:34.730
Thanks, Inflate-A-Pack!

18:44.910 --> 18:47.750
Sorry, I can't clap.

18:47.780 --> 18:49.020
All my clapping parts are broken.

18:51.850 --> 18:53.720
You're lucky.

18:53.750 --> 18:54.920
I'm just a disembodied head.

18:58.020 --> 19:00.890
Well, you'll forget all your problems

19:00.930 --> 19:04.060
when you put on
the Inflate-A-Pack!

19:08.630 --> 19:10.670
Of course, it does require having a back.

19:12.870 --> 19:13.870
And shoulders.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.840
Excuse me!

19:17.880 --> 19:20.810
I use backpacks all the time

19:20.850 --> 19:23.680
when I'm guiding city folk
through the wilderness.

19:25.680 --> 19:26.780
Where do I get one?

19:28.790 --> 19:30.650
Right here, kind mountain man!

19:30.690 --> 19:33.690
And if you order right now,

19:33.730 --> 19:37.800
we'll give you a second
Inflate-A-Pack absolutely free!

19:41.730 --> 19:44.670
I'm a skeptical scientist.

19:45.870 --> 19:48.010
How do I know this isn't
some sort of camera trick?

19:50.880 --> 19:55.920
Well, I'm glad you asked that,
world-renowned scientist.

19:55.950 --> 20:00.790
How would you like to see an
impressive live demonstration?

20:04.830 --> 20:06.690
You know what's impressive?

20:06.730 --> 20:09.060
The medical miracle that is
a girl who is only a head.

20:10.870 --> 20:13.770
Imagine that I'm pointing at myself.

20:15.070 --> 20:17.670
As you can see,
the Inflate-A-Pack...

20:17.710 --> 20:20.770
Is new and improved!

20:22.980 --> 20:24.750
What are you doing?

20:24.780 --> 20:26.710
I made a few modifications to your design.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.880
Unlike the Inflate-A-Pack,

20:34.720 --> 20:38.790
the Copter-Pack isn't powered
by dangerous, volatile gasses.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.830
We use safe, renewable propeller power

20:40.860 --> 20:44.730
to make carrying this 500
pound pack a breeze!

20:44.770 --> 20:45.800
Try it on for size!

20:54.910 --> 20:56.810
Ah!

21:03.020 --> 21:03.780
Ew!

21:03.820 --> 21:07.790
It's in my mouth!
Gross!

21:07.820 --> 21:09.790
Lexi, you're not just a head?

21:09.820 --> 21:13.060
I was wondering how you got your makeup on.

21:15.930 --> 21:17.860
Yes, that's what I was wondering.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.900
This thing is amazing.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.770
Does someone else want to try?

21:23.040 --> 21:25.710
Whoa!

21:33.780 --> 21:36.980
Careful, Gibson!
The propeller's going to hit the ceiling!

21:44.060 --> 21:46.830
My legs!
I think they're broken!

21:46.860 --> 21:50.700
Nice try, Lexi.
You're faking.

21:50.730 --> 21:51.900
What are you talking about?

21:51.930 --> 21:52.700
You're just crying wolf.

21:52.740 --> 21:54.800
No, I'm not!

21:56.910 --> 21:59.740
Wolf! Wolf!
Help me!

22:03.780 --> 22:07.020
Who knew the bag full of
bats was your good idea?

22:07.050 --> 22:09.950
Order now and receive
a free fork sharpener.

22:15.860 --> 22:18.800
Chyna, I can't tell you how sorry I am.

22:18.830 --> 22:19.800
I let my ego get in the way of everything.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.030
The truth is

22:22.070 --> 22:26.020
no idea is more important
than our friendship.

22:26.940 --> 22:31.890
And I hope you can find it somewhere deeper
in your heart to forgive my unacceptable behavior.

22:32.580 --> 22:38.920
Oh, Olive. That was beautiful.
Of course I forgive you.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.360
Tired of the awkward apologies

22:41.360 --> 22:44.690
you'd rather not make
but society says you must?

22:45.020 --> 22:47.700
Let the latest and advanced robotic technology

22:47.700 --> 22:51.330
do it for you with the Apologiz-o-Tron.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.000
Wow. This product is going to make us a billion dollars.

22:57.930 --> 23:01.250
So when you apologize in the hallway it wasn't sincere?

23:01.250 --> 23:03.250
It was just a pre-programmed machine?

23:03.250 --> 23:06.000
I can't believe you, Olive.

23:06.650 --> 23:09.960
I'm so sorry, Chyna. Please forgive me.

23:11.870 --> 23:17.450
- OK.
- The Apologiz-o-Tron. Order now!
