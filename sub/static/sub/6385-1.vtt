00:12.280 --> 00:13.679
I love you, Karen,

00:13.720 --> 00:16.598
and I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
annoying the shit out of you.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.198
Will you marry me, Karen?

00:18.240 --> 00:21.391
- You guys are officially back together?
- For now. Until we fuck it up.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.429
Could be any second now.

00:22.480 --> 00:26.871
You gonna shitcan 15 years' experience
cos a guy messes up one time?

00:29.000 --> 00:30.319
You got fired?

00:30.360 --> 00:31.588
- Charlie Runkle.
- Daisy.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.552
I've been trying to get a frigging meeting
with Ronny Praeger.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.160
- He's like the Spielberg of porn.
- I'll see what I can do.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.192
That is so awesome!
And don't worry. I will blow you.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.151
No, we're gonna keep this strictly business.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.918
I'm king of fuck mountain!

00:43.960 --> 00:45.393
It's not a memoir.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.829
It's a written account
of my sexual relationship with you.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.075
Written by me as a fucking novel.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.792
- Lew Ashby.
- Hank Moody.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.594
I got this book deal. Wanna write about
why everything I touch turns to gold.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.435
Oh, no! You didn't!

01:02.200 --> 01:03.519
Lew!

01:03.560 --> 01:04.754
Where you headed?

01:04.800 --> 01:07.314
I'm taking Fucking And Punching
all over this fair country of ours.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.113
- Mothers, lock up your sons.
- And husbands.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.756
- We made a huge mistake.
- No.

01:13.800 --> 01:18.032
I jumped in the car with you that night,
and we just tried to pick up where we left off.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.638
I can't stay.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.353
It's OK, Dad.
It was nice while it lasted.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.436
I wanna get a divorce.
I'm gonna be with Daisy.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.630
You fucked my man.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.593
- Maybe we should take a break.
- I just left my wife for you!

01:32.640 --> 01:34.073
You said I could have everything.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.556
But don't worry your pretty little head
about it. We'll let my lawyer figure it out.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.556
He's really good. Later, Runkle.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.998
- That's him.
- Him who?

01:43.040 --> 01:45.076
- What do you want?
- I'm here to see Becca Moody.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.111
I got a job. It's in New York.

01:47.160 --> 01:50.152
I think you should come.
I can't live without this.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.395
I feel kind of bad
splitting them up right now.

01:52.440 --> 01:56.752
Well, then don't. You go, I stay.
At the end of the day, it's all about her.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.552
I wish you hadn't just said all that.

01:58.600 --> 02:02.115
- Why?
- Cos it just makes me love you even more.

02:18.360 --> 02:19.634
Hank?

02:21.080 --> 02:22.957
Hank.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.840
- Hank.
- Yep. Present.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.109
- Did you just...
- No.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.071
- You did!
- Not me. I did not.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.394
Hank...

02:34.640 --> 02:37.108
Well, maybe for a second.

02:37.160 --> 02:39.469
- Jesus Christ!
- No, don't... don't be cross.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.637
- You fell asleep.
- I dozed. Barely.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.352
- Inside of me.
- Maybe. For a second.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.153
Now, it does not reflect poorly on you.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.158
Or your vagina. It's a lovely vagina.

02:50.200 --> 02:54.955
It's warm and cosy... inviting,
capacious, yet accommodating.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.355
It's cheeky but not impudent,
you know what I'm saying?

02:57.400 --> 03:01.439
- It's a lovely place to curl up inside.
- And go to sleep.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.517
- Great. God, where's my fucking clothes?
- Not so fast.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.757
Look, I may be tired,
but I'm also incredibly hard right now.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.077
You feel that?
I just flexed my cock muscle.

03:12.120 --> 03:16.272
That's pretty cool, huh?
Flexing it again and again and again.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.751
Where's the harm in a few winks?

03:19.800 --> 03:22.394
You know, single dadness
is not as easy as it looks.

03:22.440 --> 03:26.479
I gotta be up way early to make
the morning meal and get the kid to school.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.988
Then I gotta come home
and wrestle with the blank page.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.473
You know, and before you know it,

03:30.520 --> 03:33.353
it's time to get back in that fucking
pickup line all over again.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.868
- Ever hear of carpooling?
- And then I gotta...

03:35.920 --> 03:38.832
I gotta make some kind
of vaguely healthy evening meal.

03:38.880 --> 03:42.839
I gotta monitor her computer
and texting activity. It's fucking exhausting.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.952
I mean, I barely even have time
to get loaded any more.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.396
Excuse me.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.513
- Was that...
- No, you're wrong.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.199
- But...
- You're wrong. Move on.

03:58.240 --> 04:02.552
I thought you were all about
keeping yourself pure for Mom.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.398
She's a friend. You know?
We were doing friend-like stuff.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.317
Practically napping.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.675
Hey, good for you. I'm not judging.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.474
Mom's certainly not
keeping herself pure for you.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.956
- What?
- Nothing. Move on.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.713
Why are you guys even here?
You're supposed to be at the movies.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.877
- We walked out.
- It was so fucking lame, Hank.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.150
Hank? Really?

04:28.200 --> 04:30.316
Uh-uh. It's Mr Moody to you, little missy.

04:31.080 --> 04:32.718
Mr Moody.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.839
Wait a second. You guys are stoned!

04:43.880 --> 04:46.314
- Dad, please!
- Tell me where you got the weed.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.590
I will kill the motherfucker. Tell me.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.436
- In your typewriter.
- I knew it!

04:52.400 --> 04:53.549
Damn it.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.919
All right. Shit. Gimme what you got.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.679
Fork it over. Everything.
I'm gonna weigh that.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.719
No, no. Hold on, ladies.
I'm not done with you.

05:07.760 --> 05:11.673
Now, look, hey, I am very well aware
that I don't always set the best example,

05:11.720 --> 05:14.632
but you guys are entirely too young
to be messing around with this stuff.

05:14.680 --> 05:18.992
You know, it's true what they say about pot.
It's very much a gateway drug.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.031
It can be a gateway
to some pretty cool things.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.470
But it can also lead to poverty, despair,
stunted adolescence, man-breasts.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.358
You think that's funny?

05:31.640 --> 05:35.918
Oh, go on, get outta here. Both of you.
To be continued, young lady.

06:59.440 --> 07:02.989
- What up, chocolate sweetness?
- Who are you here to see?

07:03.040 --> 07:05.110
- Runkle.
- Whose uncle?

07:05.160 --> 07:07.674
Runkle. Charlie Runkle.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.676
Oh, the cute little bald guy.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.917
Just so's you know,
not a pose that inspires confidence

07:12.960 --> 07:14.439
in your one and only client.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.233
It's this goddamn economy, Hank.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.840
You can't blame everything
on the economy, douchebag.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.316
No? Can I blame it for the fact
that no one wants to publish your book?

07:23.360 --> 07:27.273
- Nonsense. People love me.
- No one, Hank. Not a soul.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.834
- What the fuck, Runkle?
- I don't know.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.793
I been collecting passes all morning.
It's too long. It's too self-indulgent.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.876
It's too hateful, too misogynistic.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.276
- It's too soft. It's too mean-spirited.
- Like those are bad things?

07:39.320 --> 07:42.278
I can't believe I'm gonna say this out loud,
but what about the studios?

07:42.320 --> 07:43.878
Nope. They're not biting either.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.912
Hollywood doesn't want something else
from the unrepentant asshole

07:46.960 --> 07:49.235
that brought you
Crazy Little Thing Called Love One...

07:49.280 --> 07:50.395
- Hank.
...and Dos?

07:50.440 --> 07:54.797
Hank, I told you to play nice, didn't I?
I told you not to fuck the director's wife.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.559
I told you not to leave
a burning bag of your own faeces

07:57.600 --> 08:00.558
- on the producer's doorstep.
- That still cracks me up.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.830
That's a big fucking bummer, Charlie.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.269
I could really use an influx of cashish
right about now.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.436
The money from the Ashby book
only went so far.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.436
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get in line, asshole.

08:09.480 --> 08:12.278
I was kinda looking forward
to the new Hank Moody book too, you know?

08:12.320 --> 08:14.276
What do you mean,
he wants to reschedule?

08:14.320 --> 08:18.233
Tell him I'll gnaw off his thimble dick
and feed it to my cats!

08:18.280 --> 08:23.195
- Runkle, quit beating your meat.
- Never gets old, Sue.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.356
Hank Moody, my boss, Sue Collini.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.472
Pleasure to have you
at the Harry Greenberg Agency, Hank.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.193
The pleasure is all mine. Obviously.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.275
Ah, your man Runkle...

08:33.320 --> 08:35.754
Now when you talk about
a cock of the walk, huh...

08:35.799 --> 08:37.392
Really?

08:37.440 --> 08:40.000
I mean, this guy's a stud!
And his head...

08:40.039 --> 08:43.669
It just makes you wanna give it a big lick
and see what comes out of it.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.632
- Please don't.
- Of course not. It would be inappropriate.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.435
Meet me for a drink later.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.950
Actually, I'm supposed
to do something with Hank here.

08:55.720 --> 08:59.076
- Me? I don't think we have any plans.
- Yeah, I think we do.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.192
No, I'm pretty sure we don't.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.549
Excellent. I'm all yours, Sue.

09:05.600 --> 09:11.277
Right. Better lay down those carbs, Runkle.
We're goin' deep.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.629
Collini... out.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.749
What fresh hell is this?

09:20.320 --> 09:23.471
- Hey. It's Rip van Winkle.
- Oh, hey!

09:23.520 --> 09:25.351
I think we should give it another shot.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.834
You know, I took a nap.
I'm fresh as a fucking daisy.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.519
- Becca's dad, right?
- Yikes.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.915
It depends on what she's done
to raise your ire.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.748
Becca? Oh, no, Becca's adorable.
It's her father I have an issue with.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.791
Oh, well, take a number and get in line.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.354
I'll tell him you're waiting.
If I see him, of course.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.757
- Felicia Koons. Chelsea's mum?
- Oh, boy.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.711
Howdy. Hank Moody.

09:47.760 --> 09:51.435
Yeah. So I guess I was wondering why
my daughter came home stoned last night.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.950
- Are you sure she was stoned?
- I know a stoned teenager when I see one.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.152
- I'm a college professor.
- Shit. I guess the jig is up.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.350
You know, far be it from me
to pass judgment

10:01.400 --> 10:03.675
on your recreational activities,

10:03.720 --> 10:07.030
but maybe you should make
your dope a little less accessible?

10:07.080 --> 10:10.993
I mean, what else do I have to worry about?
Do you have guns in the house too?

10:11.040 --> 10:14.237
Yes, I do, but I keep 'em in the freezer.
Right next to the heroin.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.793
You know, you're absolutely right.
I fucked up. I won't do it again. I get it.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.195
That shit's just for my glaucoma anyway,
you know?

10:22.240 --> 10:24.708
- Father.
- Hey, speak of the she-devils.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.194
- Can I go over to Chelsea's?
- Well...

10:27.240 --> 10:28.912
That would depend on Chelsea

10:28.960 --> 10:31.474
and her lovely,
"far too young to be a mother" here.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.398
- Mom?
- Sure. Why not?

10:34.440 --> 10:35.793
- Pick her up later.
- OK.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.195
Actually, stay for dinner.
We're having some people over.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.992
No. I don't play well with others.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.919
- It wouldn't turn out well for anybody.
- It's true, he doesn't.

10:43.960 --> 10:47.191
Look, if we're going to be bailing
these two out of jail every now and again,

10:47.240 --> 10:49.549
we may as well get to know each other
a little better.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.955
So be there. Keep the weed at home.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.594
Sure thing, Teach.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.991
And that brings us
to the issue of the house.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.634
I just want my fair share.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.992
It's been sitting on the market
for months now, Charlie. It's not selling.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.759
Maybe if you weren't too busy
bringing every unemployed actor in LA

11:11.800 --> 11:15.349
with a cougar fetish back to my house,
you could focus on getting it sold.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.517
First, it's our house.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.835
And second, if you weren't too busy

11:20.880 --> 11:24.793
trying to shove your angry inch into
every damage case that crosses your path,

11:24.840 --> 11:27.070
we wouldn't even be in this mess
to begin with.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.795
Can I get a fucking amen?
Unce, unce!

11:30.840 --> 11:32.637
Look, all I'm saying is...

11:32.680 --> 11:35.797
I can't afford to keep paying rent
and mortgage at the same time.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.796
He's hiding money somewhere.
I know it!

11:37.840 --> 11:41.719
There's nothing to hide!
She snorted it all!

11:41.760 --> 11:45.309
- You're working as an agent again!
- I'm working on commission!

11:45.360 --> 11:48.238
Really? That's pathetic, Charlie.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.636
Agreed. It's the only way
I could get back in the business, OK?

11:51.680 --> 11:54.990
It's not like the top five
were rolling out the red carpet for me.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.951
I wonder why.
Oh, that's right.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.309
They were probably afraid
you'd jerk off all over it.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.150
You know what?
Have it your way, OK?

12:05.200 --> 12:06.997
I'll just... I'll move back in.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.031
- Hells no!
- What? You said so yourself.

12:09.080 --> 12:12.789
It's our house.
My name's on the mortgage too. You know?

12:12.840 --> 12:15.035
That can't be right. Tell him, Marv!

12:15.080 --> 12:19.756
What can I say?
It's perfectly within his rights.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.712
Oh! Yes! Finally! I win!

12:46.920 --> 12:49.036
- Asshole.
- Hey.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.833
Saving the planet doesn't give you
the right to be an asshole.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.438
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

12:53.480 --> 12:55.311
Yeah, that's right. Fuck you!

12:55.360 --> 12:57.396
Live strong, asshole.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.432
- Hello?
- Hank Moody.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.471
Hello.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.469
I'd like to introduce you
to Richard Bates, the writer.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.751
- Richard Bates. Wow.
- He's going to be teaching here this year.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.756
- It's a huge coup for us.
- Big fan.

13:29.800 --> 13:33.759
- I just feel a slight man crush coming on.
- Well, thank you, aren't you kind?

13:33.800 --> 13:36.837
- This is my TA.
- Jill Robinson. Nice to meet ya.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.519
Jill, the pleasure is all yours. Or mine.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.039
OK, ours.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.475
Hank is quite the accomplished novelist
in his own right.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.593
- That's right. I googled you.
- I feel pleasantly violated.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.518
So you were just gonna
show me to the little girls' room.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.596
Sure thing. Follow me.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.471
- Tinkle, tinkle.
- Right this way.

13:56.520 --> 13:59.159
Drink with me. I insist.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.918
- Oh, no, thank you.
- No, no, please.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.669
- No, I'm fine.
- Crack The Sky was a big deal for me.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.280
I felt like I was climbing
Kilimanjaro with you.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.835
Gave me a huge writing boner.
Come on. Please?

14:10.880 --> 14:13.235
Pretty please?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.196
To the blank page.

14:34.120 --> 14:38.238
- Wow. That was something.
- It sure was.

14:38.280 --> 14:41.795
Haven't touched the stuff since Slick Willy
was in the White House.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.558
- Fuck me.
- Yes.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.068
- Now pour me another.
- Oh, no, no. The bar just closed.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.951
One was an honour,
but I'm cutting you off.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.753
Give me the fucking bottle, bush league,
before they come back.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.949
Give...

14:52.000 --> 14:53.592
- No. No.
- Give me the bottle.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.278
- No.
- Come here!

14:55.320 --> 14:58.118
My balls. Oh, shit.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.038
- Thank you.
- Don't say anything.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.913
Oh, my goodness.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.837
Whose piece of shit Porsche is that?

15:06.880 --> 15:09.155
- Stacy, what happened?
- Oh, you wouldn't believe it.

15:09.200 --> 15:13.432
- Some fucking asshole...
- Well... It's actually kind of a classic.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.789
- I just...
- Stacy, this is Becca's father.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.432
Hank Moody, the writer.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.836
Stacy, I do believe I can see
the outline of your cock.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.509
It looks like you've got yourself
a nice big fire helmet down there.

15:24.560 --> 15:28.758
I'm more of an anteater myself.
Enhances sensitivity.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.916
Shall we dine?

15:37.440 --> 15:39.351
Times are tough, Runkle.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.439
I need you to sign motherfuckers
and put them to work.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.040
That's what I want.
That's what you promised me.

15:46.080 --> 15:49.277
Absolutely. You're right, Sue.
You can count on me.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.551
I stepped away from the game
for a little while, but I am back now.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.591
- I'm just a little rusty.
- Rusty.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.473
You mean like a trombone?
Hey, anybody ever give you one of those?

15:57.520 --> 15:59.909
I don't believe so.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.554
Trust me, you'd remember.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.068
Anilingus... with a tug job.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.350
Ought to try it.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.675
What's your favourite position?

16:09.720 --> 16:11.756
- Sexually?
- Yeah.

16:11.800 --> 16:16.271
- I don't see how that's at all relevant...
- I like a stand-up 69.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.835
- You ever try it?
- That sounds challenging.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.555
Exactly! Which is why you end up
coming like a baby gorilla.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.316
So what's your take on interoffice romance?

16:28.360 --> 16:32.433
I appreciate the interest, Sue.
Really, I do.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.074
But I am right in the middle
of a nasty divorce.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.476
I'm what they call emotionally unavailable.

16:38.520 --> 16:41.796
Emotions?
Who needs emotions?

16:41.840 --> 16:45.435
I'm thinking about your tube steak.
Is that unavailable too?

16:47.520 --> 16:49.829
Oh, you can play hard to get
all you like, Runkle.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.950
Whatever makes you wet.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.992
But Sue Collini always gets the wienie.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.076
Always.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.513
Bottoms up, cowboy.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.753
Right of way or not,
you were definitely hogging the road.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.758
- You flicked your cigarette at me.
- Sure. But you gave me the finger.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.633
That got my Irish up.
That was downright antisocial of you.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.796
Yes. But you were honking
your horn repeatedly.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.593
Which brings us back full circle
to the fact that you were hogging the road.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.631
- I'm just sayin'...
- I had the right of way.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.318
- Who says?
- State of California.

17:17.359 --> 17:18.873
- I don't agree.
- He doesn't agree.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.194
- I don't agree.
- Can we change the subject, please?

17:21.240 --> 17:24.117
I'm fine with that.
I mean, I've already moved on.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.037
And I won't hold any grudges. I'm cool.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.789
- Hate the game, not the player.
- I'll drink to that.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.710
- Unbelievable.
- Can we be excused?

17:34.760 --> 17:38.799
- Please. I insist.
- Hey, ladies, no Mary Jane.

17:38.840 --> 17:43.356
I'm serious. Try me. I'm like a drug-sniffing
dog with a hard-on for justice.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.992
- Yeah. Hey...
- Father.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.838
- Now get outta here.
- Jesus.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.516
OK, I'm gonna throw this out to the table.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.870
What are you guys thinking,
gay, bi-curious, huh? What?

17:55.160 --> 17:56.878
What is wrong with you?

17:56.920 --> 18:00.390
What? I'm the asshole just because
I say what's on everybody's mind?

18:00.440 --> 18:03.193
- It never occurred to me.
- Actually, me neither.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.596
I can't really say I see it myself.

18:06.640 --> 18:10.110
Little girls in pretty boxes.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.273
Well, I'm not afraid
to put it out there, you know?

18:14.320 --> 18:16.515
And if my daughter decides she's a gay,

18:16.560 --> 18:19.028
I cannot think of a nicer gal that she can,

18:19.080 --> 18:21.275
you know,
indulge her Sapphic tendencies with.

18:21.320 --> 18:25.233
- That's vaguely sweet, I think.
- Yes. Vaguely nauseating.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.271
Where is the boom-boom room?

18:27.320 --> 18:30.710
It's just down the hall, Richard, to your left.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.039
Good squash.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.152
Ten years' sobriety, down the drain.
Nice job.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.714
How is he gonna get up in front of a class?

18:39.760 --> 18:42.320
- Well, you know what they say.
- No, what do they say, Hank?

18:42.360 --> 18:47.480
You really have to want to quit.
You gotta hit rock bottom.

18:48.120 --> 18:52.671
- Can I have a word with you, dear?
- Sure, darling.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.116
So what's your story, morning glory?

19:02.120 --> 19:05.271
- I'm 33.
- Perfect.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.959
- I'm getting my PhD on.
- Perfect.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.468
English lit. I love to read.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.159
That's my drug of choice, the written word.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.510
And...
I just ended a five-year relationship

19:16.560 --> 19:18.357
that yielded me a big, fat nothing.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.198
Not to make it sound like
a cold, hard business deal, but...

19:22.840 --> 19:24.273
Whatever.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.470
And my 20s went by
like a warm summer day,

19:26.520 --> 19:29.910
and now my uterus is
deteriorating with every breath.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.316
So, yeah, I see it all.
You're handsome and you're funny and...

19:34.480 --> 19:38.837
Really, unless you're a serious prospect,
do not so much as smile at me.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.996
Really, truly. Don't try to charm me.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.678
It would just be a heinous crime

19:42.720 --> 19:45.518
against the other sex,
given this full disclosure.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.390
And I'm hard.

19:50.440 --> 19:55.116
No, please, seriously.
You're really dangerous. Please stay away.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.716
Let's try again, shall we?

20:00.640 --> 20:02.471
That's mighty white of you, Stace.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.476
- Stacy.
- Stacy.

20:04.520 --> 20:08.149
- Koons, right?
- That's right.

20:08.960 --> 20:13.033
You're the dean
of this fine institute of fancy book learning?

20:13.080 --> 20:17.039
- Correct.
- Which would make you Dean Koons?

20:17.080 --> 20:18.832
I've heard that one before.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.838
Who wants to see me tuck
and do the pee-pee dance?

20:21.880 --> 20:23.359
Oh, my God. Richard!

20:25.000 --> 20:26.911
Come on. I can't be the only one.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.748
- And then, just like that...
- Where are the girls?

20:30.800 --> 20:34.679
He unveiled his beautiful man-pussy.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.269
His glorious mangina.

20:40.880 --> 20:45.510
Meet my peach, baby, blow on my dice

20:45.560 --> 20:50.509
I wanna swing that swing
Don't you treat me nice

20:50.560 --> 20:53.313
- Richard, let me...
- I'm wild for you

20:53.360 --> 20:57.319
- Let me call you a cab. Let me...
- Sweet baby, I'm a child for you

20:57.360 --> 21:00.557
- Let's get your clothes.
- Why don't you stay in the guest room?

21:00.600 --> 21:02.636
- Stacy.
- Yeah.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.875
Have you ever spent time
with an 11-year-old boy

21:04.920 --> 21:07.912
and wanted more from him
than he was willing to give?

21:07.960 --> 21:12.954
Have you ever breathed in the scent of
a woman's sweaty, unwashed sex and just...

21:14.520 --> 21:17.034
...wanted to bottle and sell it at market?

21:18.440 --> 21:21.159
Have you ever been so drunk on cock

21:21.200 --> 21:23.236
you howled at the moon

21:23.280 --> 21:25.874
and begged for a few inches more?

21:25.920 --> 21:28.593
Ladies? Dean Koons?

21:28.640 --> 21:31.916
All these questions and more
will be answered...

21:31.960 --> 21:34.428
...in my new novel.

21:34.480 --> 21:39.110
- Let's get you dressed.
- First, I wanna go for a swim!

21:44.640 --> 21:47.871
Love that guy.
Big fan.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.270
- Big dick.
- Wow!

21:59.920 --> 22:02.514
What do you want, Charlie?
I'm watching my stories.

22:02.560 --> 22:06.599
Marcy Ellen Runkle.
I love you.

22:08.040 --> 22:11.237
Go home, you miserable sack of shit.
Sleep it off!

22:11.280 --> 22:16.149
But this is my home! This!
And you know why?

22:17.320 --> 22:19.788
Because Marcy lives here.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.308
She's my home.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.397
- My true west.
- North.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.158
- What?
- True north.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.191
- That's what they say.
- Who?

22:29.840 --> 22:31.319
Oh. What?

22:33.040 --> 22:34.996
Hey, Marce...

22:36.120 --> 22:40.272
Let's give it another shot.
What do you say?

22:40.320 --> 22:43.153
- No?
- OK, fair enough.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.078
Can I use the bathroom?

22:46.120 --> 22:49.078
I have to go numero dos,

22:49.120 --> 22:52.396
and I don't know if I'm gonna make it
back to Westwood in time.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.431
Make it quick, asshole.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.990
You sure Becca's OK to spend the night?

22:58.040 --> 23:00.873
Yeah. Let her sleep.
I'll drop her off in the morning.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.070
But you'll keep an eye on them?

23:03.840 --> 23:07.799
Oh, right. For signs of lesbianism.
Yeah. Will do. I'll be vigilant.

23:09.160 --> 23:12.914
Sorry about the drama tonight.
You must think I'm a world-class A-hole.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.758
Don't know about the world-class.

23:15.800 --> 23:20.032
Yeah, well, thank you. What about Bates?
Is he gonna be able to do his thing?

23:20.080 --> 23:22.878
From rehab? I doubt it.

23:22.920 --> 23:26.515
You wouldn't happen to know
of any other bad-boy novelists

23:26.560 --> 23:29.358
looking for a teaching gig, would you?

23:29.400 --> 23:33.154
I don't know. I will bring it up
at the next union meeting.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.839
- Good night.
- Night.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.635
Where are you headed?

23:42.880 --> 23:46.589
- Just home to the cats.
- Sounds hot.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.389
How about a libation?

23:50.440 --> 23:52.590
Like that could possibly end well.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.870
Oh, look at you with the foresight and all.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.195
- Well played, lady.
- Thanks.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.630
Good night, Mr Moody.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

24:00.680 --> 24:04.150
Good night, psycho.
Take good care of that uterus.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.077
Oh, my God, Charlie.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.032
- What are you doing in there?
- It's my IBS!

24:23.080 --> 24:26.356
You know how it kicks in
in times of extreme duress.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.631
Well, this is one of those times!

24:39.600 --> 24:42.353
All right. It's all right.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.156
Miserable slob.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.431
Guest room. Go.

24:55.160 --> 24:58.835
- What up, lady fair?
- Hank, it's late.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.155
And yet you don't sound
even remotely sleepy.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.431
- Burning the midnight oil?
- Something like that.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.199
I get it. Big date, huh?

25:07.240 --> 25:10.038
- I'm not sure how big it was.
- Gross.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.155
Bad breath. HOB.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.515
- HOB?
- Hair On Back.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.596
Well, now I'm starting to feel better.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.553
- What about you?
- What about me?

25:23.600 --> 25:26.239
Our monkey in the middle
said something about

25:26.280 --> 25:28.669
crossing paths with a friend of yours.

25:28.720 --> 25:33.111
- Oh, she's a little meddler, that one.
- That she is.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.355
Well, not to worry.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.630
Bad breath. HOB.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.997
I miss you.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.837
I miss you too.

25:43.880 --> 25:46.155
It ain't the same without you, you know.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.837
That's nice to hear.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.235
I think it's good, though.

25:53.280 --> 25:56.670
- What's good?
- We're living our lives.

25:56.720 --> 26:00.554
We're being all normal
and responsible and...

26:00.600 --> 26:03.194
like real, live grown-ups.

26:03.240 --> 26:07.438
Well, yeah, I do feel
vaguely functional these days.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.472
You know, I think
you might even be proud of me.

26:10.520 --> 26:13.159
I'm always proud of you.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.395
Even when I'm not.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.911
That's nice to hear.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.720
- But...
- But what?

26:26.240 --> 26:28.834
What if, in the process of being...

26:28.880 --> 26:33.192
all responsible and grown-up like,
we...

26:33.240 --> 26:35.800
just kinda get over each other?

26:39.920 --> 26:41.319
What if...

26:41.360 --> 26:44.591
you tell me about our daughter?

26:46.960 --> 26:48.313
Well...

26:48.360 --> 26:51.193
Things are changing, Karen,
just like you said they would.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.800
I mean, fast, you know, but I'm...

26:53.840 --> 26:58.277
I'm holding on as hard as I can,
and I am not gonna let go.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.914
I mean, I won't forget you...
