08:41.364 --> 08:44.732
The only question is the means.

08:44.734 --> 08:46.867
You remember how I got kicked
out of here, don't you?

08:46.869 --> 08:50.204
Sure, you did a pearly white
puncture job on a kid.

08:50.206 --> 08:53.342
I don't think we'll ever get
Julien to bite a zoo visitor.

08:53.344 --> 08:56.278
Well, who says it has to be him?

08:56.280 --> 08:57.547
[Flapping lips]

08:57.549 --> 08:59.682
Randy, underneath
that sweater beats

08:59.684 --> 09:01.751
the heart of a wolf.

09:01.753 --> 09:04.754
I bite the people,
and then we go home?

09:04.756 --> 09:06.990
Just a nibble.
No skin breakage.

09:06.992 --> 09:09.159
And stupid bunnies stay here?

09:09.161 --> 09:10.260
Exactly.

09:10.262 --> 09:13.664
I'm gonna bite the peoples!

09:13.666 --> 09:15.332
I want two choco bombs,

09:15.334 --> 09:17.801
five gum breakers,
and a large slurp soda.

09:17.803 --> 09:19.402
Ooh, and zippy sticks.

09:19.404 --> 09:20.737
Ten zippy sticks.

09:20.739 --> 09:23.240
Skipper, the Vesuvius twins
are sugaring up.

09:23.242 --> 09:25.276
Then they'll be en route
to the petting zoo.

09:25.278 --> 09:26.844
Ten-four, Kowalski.

09:26.846 --> 09:28.946
The Vesuvius twins... perfect.

09:28.948 --> 09:31.316
If anyone deserves
Mort's might bite,

09:31.318 --> 09:33.986
it's Park Avenue's brattiest.

09:33.988 --> 09:35.855
Uh-oh, I'm stuck.

09:35.857 --> 09:37.190
Get him off of there.

09:37.192 --> 09:39.092
We need those choppers.

09:39.094 --> 09:40.560
All right, animals.

09:40.562 --> 09:41.861
For petting.

09:41.863 --> 09:44.897
Pull.
The biting window is closing.

09:44.899 --> 09:45.899
[Wretches]

09:45.901 --> 09:46.933
[Groaning]

09:46.935 --> 09:48.301
[Kids laughing]

09:48.303 --> 09:49.769
Find your happy place.

09:49.771 --> 09:52.005
[Grunting]

09:52.007 --> 09:53.140
[Groaning]

09:53.142 --> 09:54.942
[Gasps] Ooh, look at those.

09:54.944 --> 09:56.110
Monkey things.

09:56.112 --> 09:57.912
Ooh, fresh meat.

09:57.914 --> 09:59.246
I've changed my mind.

09:59.248 --> 10:00.881
I don't like
the petting zoo anymore.

10:00.883 --> 10:02.850
We'll protect you, Your Majesty.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.618
Puh-ha-ha.
From what?

10:04.620 --> 10:07.621
These humans are obviously
bringing tributes

10:07.623 --> 10:10.724
of tasty snacks
to the petting zoo king.

10:10.726 --> 10:12.125
Eh, I accept your offerings.

10:12.127 --> 10:13.126
Ah!

10:13.128 --> 10:15.329
This thing is attacking me!

10:15.331 --> 10:18.132
Get it off!
Get it off!

10:18.134 --> 10:19.199
[Slurping]

10:19.201 --> 10:20.901
Oh, brain freeze.

10:20.903 --> 10:22.569
No, no, Mrs. Vesuvius.

10:22.571 --> 10:24.671
Lemurs shouldn't even be
in the petting zoo.

10:24.673 --> 10:26.239
Frankly, I don't even know how

10:26.241 --> 10:27.674
they got there
in the first place.

10:27.676 --> 10:29.009
Stupid computer.

10:29.011 --> 10:30.777
Mission accomplished, boys.

10:30.779 --> 10:32.178
Hooray!

10:32.180 --> 10:33.513
[Rattling]

10:33.515 --> 10:36.583
No! I do not want
this kingdom!

10:36.585 --> 10:38.218
Take me back
to my petting kingdom.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.219
I order you.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.587
Please-hee-hee-hease.

10:40.589 --> 10:42.056
Aw, guys.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.358
I'll sure miss
our next door neighborliness.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.460
Right, not gonna be the same.

10:46.462 --> 10:49.932
Still, I can drop by any time,
go for a swim,

10:49.934 --> 10:51.734
sing some showtunes.

10:51.736 --> 10:53.536
Oh, uh...

10:53.538 --> 10:55.805
Oh, yeah, yeah, great.
Just--just call first.

10:55.807 --> 10:57.173
But I don't have a phone.

10:57.175 --> 10:59.711
Oh, neither do we. Later.
