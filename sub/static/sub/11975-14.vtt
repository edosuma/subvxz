WEBVTT

00:09.067 --> 00:10.700
Are you excited for

00:10.700 --> 00:13.000
Cuba?
Keeping Up

00:13.000 --> 00:14.967
- with the Kardashians...
- I asked him, I said,

00:14.967 --> 00:16.467
"Have you been having any more
dark thoughts?"

00:16.467 --> 00:19.767
And he goes, "No, I'm great."
And that's what concerned me.

00:19.767 --> 00:23.267
I finally get in touch with
Lamar, and he sounds great,

00:23.267 --> 00:25.700
but almost too good, where now
I'm, like, paranoid in that I'm

00:25.700 --> 00:27.100
like, "Why do you sound so
good?"

00:27.100 --> 00:28.767
- It just, like, freaks me out.
- Everything is out in

00:28.767 --> 00:31.433
the open now, so there is no
secret to what he could

00:31.433 --> 00:35.333
- potentially do again.
- So crazy.

00:35.333 --> 00:38.800
Do you understand that
that was hurtful to us, that we

00:38.800 --> 00:40.900
found out about your
engagement on social media?

00:40.900 --> 00:42.967
Yes, I understand.
You act like I'm supposed to

00:42.967 --> 00:45.367
just call you guys and just say,
"Oh, this and that," when you

00:45.367 --> 00:46.600
- hate this girl.
- We would have

00:46.600 --> 00:47.800
- appreciated that.
- So, it's like...

00:47.800 --> 00:49.600
Of course we would
be happy for you.

00:49.600 --> 00:54.467
The last thing I want is drama
with my own brother, and I want

00:54.467 --> 00:58.167
to figure out a way so that
everybody can get along and be

00:58.167 --> 01:00.700
- a happy family.
- People need to make up

01:00.700 --> 01:13.533
and get over things.♪ ♪

01:13.533 --> 01:16.267
Ugh.
An agent texts me two days ago

01:16.267 --> 01:18.900
and said, "Hey, there's this new
player.

01:18.900 --> 01:23.667
He really is into your sister."
And I go, "Which one?"

01:23.667 --> 01:26.067
And then he goes, "Kendall."
And then Kendall and I

01:26.067 --> 01:28.800
Googled him, we decided she's
not into him, whatever, so then

01:28.800 --> 01:33.867
he says, "Okay, is the other
sister Kylie down to talk?"

01:33.867 --> 01:36.633
Yeah, it's just like
going through the rotation.

01:36.633 --> 01:39.100
And Kendall was like,
"How dumb are you?"

01:39.100 --> 01:42.000
That's so gross.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.300
Malika, she's, like,
the best sidekick, 'cause she's

01:44.300 --> 01:47.767
down for whatever, but I saw
Malika do some crazy things last

01:47.767 --> 01:49.300
- night.
- I feel like this

01:49.300 --> 01:51.333
weekend, like, was a lot of
sinning.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.767
A lot of sinning; we
all need to go to church.

01:53.767 --> 01:56.467
- I need holy water.
- I haven't sinned in

01:56.467 --> 02:00.533
- years.
You-You're married.

02:00.533 --> 02:02.633
You don't want this life.
Trust me.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.033
No, I'm just saying,
like...

02:04.033 --> 02:05.867
- You don't to go here.
- I don't have the urge,

02:05.867 --> 02:08.567
so that's good.
You know?

02:08.567 --> 02:14.100
Like, living a content life...
is so good and fulfilling.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.067
That's really nice
for you.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.200
When I drive up
here, I'm like, "Oh, it's so

02:39.200 --> 02:41.200
boring up here," and then when I
come here, I realize how

02:41.200 --> 02:43.833
peaceful and amazing it is.
This is so nice.

02:43.833 --> 02:45.667
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.367
You kind of match
with the whole couch.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.033
I know.
That was my plan.

02:49.033 --> 02:50.567
I love it.
Was Kylie at Mother's Day?

02:50.567 --> 02:51.833
- Yeah.
- What went on?

02:51.833 --> 02:54.133
So, I didn't go to
Mother's Day because Rob hasn't

02:54.133 --> 02:56.533
been to Mother's Day in the
last three years, so I'll bow

02:56.533 --> 03:00.100
this one out.
I think there's a lot of tension

03:00.100 --> 03:02.767
and a lot of unfinished
business, things that are just

03:02.767 --> 03:04.867
are not resolved with my
brother.

03:04.867 --> 03:07.533
So I was more than happy to
sleep in on Mother's Day and let

03:07.533 --> 03:10.167
my brother take this holiday.
And 'cause I heard Chyna was

03:10.167 --> 03:11.533
going; no one ever told me she
actually came.

03:11.533 --> 03:12.667
She came on
Mother's Day.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.067
So, she showed up
and...

03:14.067 --> 03:16.067
We all--
She brought King.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.867
The kids had a blast.
They had so much fun.

03:17.867 --> 03:19.100
Forget about the
kids.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.233
- Right.
- Tell us about

03:20.233 --> 03:21.533
- Chyna.
- I mean, you know.

03:21.533 --> 03:24.133
It's like, everyone was
totally fine, got along.

03:24.133 --> 03:25.567
And was she, like,
sitting and just, like,

03:25.567 --> 03:27.100
- chilling?
- Yeah, they had... I

03:27.100 --> 03:28.700
- felt her belly.
- Kourtney.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.033
She said she's
feeling great, like, you know.

03:31.033 --> 03:36.933
I mean, my brother's having his
first kid.

03:36.933 --> 03:40.800
Like, what am I gonna do except
support him?

03:40.800 --> 03:44.667
We love Rob so much, and just
having him around, I think it

03:44.667 --> 03:48.067
was great.
We need to make sure that we're

03:48.067 --> 03:50.767
all getting along, because we
don't want a baby coming into

03:50.767 --> 03:53.100
this world with all this
tension.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.100
Kourtney is the most
politically correct person right

03:55.100 --> 03:56.433
- now.
- No.

03:56.433 --> 04:00.367
She's not over the top.
Like, she's not like, "Hey,

04:00.367 --> 04:03.367
Happy Mother's Day!
Oh, my God, I can't wait to

04:03.367 --> 04:05.900
see you."
But, I mean, why would she be?

04:05.900 --> 04:09.767
It's probably hard for Chyna,
you know?

04:09.767 --> 04:11.767
Oh, boy.
That's weird.

04:11.767 --> 04:14.967
Very, very weird.
You're really giving J-Lo vibes

04:14.967 --> 04:16.600
- today.
- Me?

04:16.600 --> 04:17.833
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.533
I haven't seen you
in person for awhile.

04:19.533 --> 04:20.833
- You're really skinny.
- Why? So, what does

04:20.833 --> 04:22.200
- that mean... I'm skinny?
- Your face looks

04:22.200 --> 04:32.833
good.

04:32.833 --> 04:38.767
Seatbelt, please.

04:38.767 --> 04:41.267
What'd you just do?

04:41.267 --> 04:42.600
- Nothing.
- Why'd you just fart,

04:42.600 --> 04:44.400
yo?
What's wrong with you?

04:44.400 --> 04:46.367
- No, I didn't, yo.
- Yes, you did.

04:46.367 --> 04:49.233
Lamar, you smell.
Why do you do that?

04:49.233 --> 04:51.533
- That's disgusting.
- It's better out than

04:51.533 --> 04:53.633
- going in.
- No. For who?

04:53.633 --> 04:57.533
Do that by yourself.
God.

04:57.533 --> 05:00.367
- I want McDonald's.
- No.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.900
You're on a diet.
How's McDonald's helping you?

05:03.900 --> 05:11.333
Do you still take your medicine
every morning?

05:11.333 --> 05:13.700
Ever since coming back from
Cuba, I've been so worried about

05:13.700 --> 05:15.800
Lamar.
I really want to keep Lamar in,

05:15.800 --> 05:19.333
like, a positive space and keep
him busy with positive things,

05:19.333 --> 05:22.833
- surrounded by positive people.
- Yeah, look at the

05:22.833 --> 05:26.300
- hairs on that mane.
- Oh, cute.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.567
Look, is the baby with it?
Look at the little baby.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.933
- Want to go out and pet it?
- No.

05:31.933 --> 05:33.500
Why not?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.300
- I'm scared of horses.
- It's in a cage; what's

05:36.300 --> 05:38.233
- it gonna do to you?
- One almost attacked

05:38.233 --> 05:40.000
- me.
- I'll never forget, that

05:40.000 --> 05:42.433
went wild.

05:42.433 --> 05:59.900
I ran so fast.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.267
What are you doing?

06:02.267 --> 06:05.633
Just taking a Snap.
Snapchat.

06:05.633 --> 06:09.400
And you needed to get
up on the dance floor?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.600
- I brought food for you.
- Food?

06:11.600 --> 06:13.367
Yeah, I got that--
I went to Blue Table, and I

06:13.367 --> 06:15.733
haven't been in so long.
I got that sandwich you used to

06:15.733 --> 06:18.033
- always get there.
- I don't think I can

06:18.033 --> 06:21.100
- eat it anymore.
- Why?

06:21.100 --> 06:23.967
'Cause it has
cheese.

06:23.967 --> 06:30.800
I'm doing non-dairy, and it has
gluten in the bread.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.900
But you were fine
eating this for years and years

06:32.900 --> 06:35.467
- and years.
- No.

06:35.467 --> 06:37.867
This used to be your
favorite sandwich.

06:37.867 --> 06:40.400
You know, I've known Kourtney
for a very long time.

06:40.400 --> 06:46.233
And all of a sudden, she thinks
she's allergic to everything.

06:46.233 --> 06:50.000
You're not allergic.
Nothing will happen to you.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.767
It actually does
smell good, but I'm not gonna

06:51.767 --> 06:53.100
- have it.
- Look at this.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.333
Oh, look at it just...
"Hello."

06:55.333 --> 06:56.633
I'm not gonna have
it though.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.033
"Eat me."
Stop.

06:58.033 --> 06:59.667
"Eat me."
No.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.133
Have a bite.
You're fine.

07:01.133 --> 07:04.967
It's in your head, all these
diet and allergies and gluten

07:04.967 --> 07:07.833
and dairy.
You can eat this.

07:07.833 --> 07:10.600
I saw you eat this for years and
you were fine.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.900
I also saw you eat this when you
were pregnant with our children

07:12.900 --> 07:15.033
and they came out perfect.
So?

07:15.033 --> 07:19.500
- I need two marshes.
- Two marshes?

07:19.500 --> 07:21.767
- Are they gluten free?
- They are.

07:21.767 --> 07:24.633
Gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan
marshmallows, and they're the

07:24.633 --> 07:26.633
- best.
- Sounds like you're

07:26.633 --> 07:29.967
putting nothing in yourself, but
sounds great.

07:29.967 --> 07:31.967
I'll have one, too,
P.

07:31.967 --> 07:38.433
Whoa!
There's mom's lunch.

07:38.433 --> 07:40.167
Mm-mm.
- What?

07:40.167 --> 07:44.367
Mase, come here. I need backup.

07:44.367 --> 07:47.700
Thank you.

07:47.700 --> 07:52.100
Bring her over here.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.133
Give me the marshmallow out
of your mouth.

07:56.433 --> 07:58.533
I'm gonna get that thing.

07:58.533 --> 08:00.567
- Swallow it, P.
- No!

08:00.567 --> 08:12.533
- Swallow it.
- She's quick.

08:12.533 --> 08:15.200
- Oh.
- I'll get you some

08:15.200 --> 08:17.067
napkin.
It's all right.

08:17.067 --> 08:19.633
- Please.
- It's all right.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.100
If this was anybody
else, she would cuss them out,

08:22.100 --> 08:24.867
"What the?"
Damn right.

08:24.867 --> 08:27.733
You have her wrapped
around your little finger.

08:27.733 --> 08:31.400
Sauce all over her gray rug, and
she doesn't even flinch.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.000
It's okay, Lammy, I got
you.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.300
Has my mom ever gotten
me a napkin ever? No.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.433
Or got on her knees to clean up
after us?

08:37.433 --> 08:40.333
- Never.
- It's all right.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.967
- How are the kids?
- They got so big, man.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.733
Right?
Tall.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.067
Yeah, he played ball,
so he just, you know, he in his

08:47.067 --> 08:49.467
- own world.
- Have you tried to play

08:49.467 --> 08:52.867
basketball again?
Just for fun?

08:52.867 --> 08:54.767
- Like, dribble the ball, or...
- Yeah.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.300
...bounce it around for
a minute?

08:56.300 --> 08:58.300
Mm-hmm.
- You know, Kourtney has

08:58.300 --> 09:00.333
- that basketball court.
- Yeah.

09:00.333 --> 09:04.000
- Right down the street.
I'm-a go to this, um,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.067
training facility in Santa
Barbara.

09:07.067 --> 09:12.667
A lot of pros and, um, guys that
would be pros work out there.

09:12.667 --> 09:16.067
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.667
Basketball is
obviously Lamar's passion and

09:18.667 --> 09:21.667
love, and anything that's
positive and uplifting, I'm all

09:21.667 --> 09:25.333
for, but Lamar hasn't followed
through recently with so many

09:25.333 --> 09:27.333
things.
Like, I need to see some

09:27.333 --> 09:29.467
consistency and a little effort
on Lamar's part.

09:29.467 --> 09:33.000
Going to a basketball camp is a
big step, and I don't want to

09:33.000 --> 09:35.267
- set him up for failure.
- And so you would just

09:35.267 --> 09:36.867
- train?
- Yeah.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.533
That sounds really
cool.

09:38.533 --> 09:51.167
Yeah, I'm looking
forward to going.

09:51.167 --> 09:53.033
Your hair looks
cute.

09:53.033 --> 09:54.500
- The braid?
- Who did it?

09:54.500 --> 09:56.367
- Cesar.
- Yeah.

09:56.367 --> 09:57.867
Cute, right?
Your makeup looks good.

09:57.867 --> 09:59.500
Last night's was
awful.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.233
Like, I couldn't even
Snapchat myself, I had to...

10:02.233 --> 10:03.633
- It would take like...
- I hate it when you can't

10:03.633 --> 10:05.433
- Snap yourself.
- It was, like, would

10:05.433 --> 10:08.767
take ten times to do a Snap
because it was so bad.

10:08.767 --> 10:10.533
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.567
Did I tell you what
Chyna wrote to me?

10:12.567 --> 10:14.800
- What did she write?
- She basically told me

10:14.800 --> 10:17.767
that she's doing animated
emojis.

10:17.767 --> 10:20.933
They showed Chyna hers, Chyna
sent me hers, and there was one

10:20.933 --> 10:23.800
- of her kicking a tiger.
- Yeah.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.567
- Like, for Tyga.
- Yeah.

10:25.567 --> 10:27.100
And she said, "Oh, I
told them to take that out.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.967
I don't want to put that one
in."

10:28.967 --> 10:31.700
So it'll be interesting to
see... She acted like she had

10:31.700 --> 10:35.633
the power.
I think it's super cool of Chyna

10:35.633 --> 10:37.967
to just give me the head's up,
just so we all know what's going

10:37.967 --> 10:40.367
on with each other, since, you
know, she's having a baby with

10:40.367 --> 10:43.333
my brother.
I really do appreciate that.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.700
How was she when
you guys went to hang out?

10:45.700 --> 10:48.167
She's so friendly.
Like, if you hung out with her,

10:48.167 --> 10:50.433
she just would be like, "Oh,
do you want this product for

10:50.433 --> 10:52.200
your skin?
Oh, my friend-- I know exactly

10:52.200 --> 10:54.167
where to get it, hold on.
Let me get it for you."

10:54.167 --> 10:57.300
If Chyna's coming
out with ChyMojis, it's nice

10:57.300 --> 11:00.433
that she's running it by Kim,
who was, like, the original

11:00.433 --> 11:04.367
KIMOJI inventor.
The more time that the family

11:04.367 --> 11:08.533
can spend with Chyna, hopefully,
everybody can, like, accept that

11:08.533 --> 11:11.267
she's going to be a part of our
family.

11:11.267 --> 11:13.867
She's, like, totally
normal, like, as if nothing,

11:13.867 --> 11:27.267
- like, ever happened.
- Yeah.

11:27.267 --> 11:29.633
- KK.
- Hi.

11:29.633 --> 11:32.600
- Oh, yeah, comfort.
- That's a pretty color

11:32.600 --> 11:34.967
on you.
Especially on that couch.

11:34.967 --> 11:37.333
- Thank you.
- Um, I need to call

11:37.333 --> 11:39.933
Elizabeth.
Because Lam wants, you know, he

11:39.933 --> 11:42.000
still wants to go to that
basketball camp in Santa

11:42.000 --> 11:46.467
Barbara.
And I don't mind if he goes, but

11:46.467 --> 11:51.467
I said to him, "Why don't you go
to your boxing class five days a

11:51.467 --> 11:53.500
week that I've set up for you?"
Mm-hmm.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.533
"Consistent-- go five
days a week, and if you could

11:55.533 --> 11:58.433
follow through five days a
week, for one week, I'll think

11:58.433 --> 12:01.267
about it."
I think that's a

12:01.267 --> 12:03.833
- lovely compromise.
- He hasn't gone to

12:03.833 --> 12:07.967
one workout.
I am just so conflicted right

12:07.967 --> 12:12.100
now, and I feel guilty about it.
I want the best for Lamar.

12:12.100 --> 12:14.767
I love that he would be
spending his time in such a

12:14.767 --> 12:17.033
positive way.
But, you know, with everything

12:17.033 --> 12:19.933
going on lately, there's just
not a lot of trust there.

12:19.933 --> 12:22.167
There's nothing wrong
with helping someone when

12:22.167 --> 12:24.467
they're in need.
But you don't want to make a

12:24.467 --> 12:27.733
habit of giving, giving and
giving to someone that is only

12:27.733 --> 12:29.800
proven that they're not ready to
do it.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.700
Yeah.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.867
I called Lam and I was like,
"You should talk to someone.

12:37.867 --> 12:39.867
Like, I don't know how
to help you.

12:39.867 --> 12:42.200
Like, I wish I did."
It's really frustrating because

12:42.200 --> 12:45.333
you can't do anything if the
person's not willing to take

12:45.333 --> 12:49.867
control of their life and get
help.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.467
Did you see the
emoji?

12:51.467 --> 12:55.800
These emojis come out and
there's some that we all don't

12:55.800 --> 12:59.733
even know what to think about.
There was, like, one of, um,

12:59.733 --> 13:01.633
her slapping Kylie.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.800
- Hey.
- Why would this be so

13:18.800 --> 13:21.633
complicated for, like, a normal
person to use?

13:21.633 --> 13:23.733
Look at this cool new watch I
got.

13:23.733 --> 13:25.733
- I don't know what it does yet.
- Oh, you know what time

13:25.733 --> 13:27.533
- it is?
- But I just want-- it's

13:27.533 --> 13:29.233
like, I'm just learning how to
work this.

13:29.233 --> 13:31.900
Holy.
You really got some closet on

13:31.900 --> 13:34.000
- you, kid.
- Thank you.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.567
It must feel good.
Coming up in here is like,

13:37.567 --> 13:40.967
"Damn. I done made it."
Let me ask you a question.

13:40.967 --> 13:43.733
Do you not think it's a little
ridiculous how obsessed Kourtney

13:43.733 --> 13:46.667
- is with all these allergies?
- Yeah, well, honestly,

13:46.667 --> 13:50.167
I don't think-- I don't know.
Some of the things, like...

13:50.167 --> 13:52.333
They change every day,
number one, which is not normal

13:52.333 --> 13:54.333
when you're really allergic to
something.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.367
I think it's, like,
her hobby.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.533
Right.
"Once in a while it's not

13:58.533 --> 14:01.467
so bad."
I go, "No, not once in a while."

14:01.467 --> 14:03.900
It doesn't work like that.
No middle ground.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.000
- There's no logic.
- I know, for a fact,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Kourtney's not allergic to all
these things.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.567
The worst part about it is, I
really can't tolerate lactose.

14:11.567 --> 14:14.400
I got a real allergy.
She doesn't.

14:14.400 --> 14:20.067
The next time we're over at the
house, I think we swap out her

14:20.067 --> 14:24.033
drink of what she usually drinks
and then just watch her.

14:24.033 --> 14:26.067
- Regular soy and almond.
- But what if, what if

14:26.067 --> 14:29.500
- she really can't have it?
- I've seen her eat ice

14:29.500 --> 14:32.000
cream in front of me!
I've seen her eat pizza, I've

14:32.000 --> 14:34.533
seen her eat every crap there is
when no one's looking.

14:34.533 --> 14:36.200
What the
does this do?

14:36.200 --> 14:37.533
She made this up
in her mind!

14:37.533 --> 14:39.533
Are you really trying to, like,
connect this watch to your phone

14:39.533 --> 14:41.567
- thing right now?
- Well, I just, it's...

14:41.567 --> 14:43.567
What are you even
gonna do with it, by the way?

14:43.567 --> 14:45.567
Kourtney could be allergic to
that.

14:45.567 --> 14:47.833
What kind of rubber is this?
Yeah, she can't have that around

14:47.833 --> 14:50.033
her hands.

14:50.033 --> 14:52.033
Imagine a spaceship just
came in?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.900
Oh, my chairs came, by
my new table.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.500
Okay, well, these are gray.
Correct?

15:05.500 --> 15:08.100
- Yeah.
- When you guys ordered

15:08.100 --> 15:10.833
these chairs outside, did you
guys check that you ordered

15:10.833 --> 15:13.500
black, question mark?
These are not black whatsoever,

15:13.500 --> 15:15.400
period.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.633
I'm tired of waiting
for things to come into my house

15:18.633 --> 15:21.133
- and they always come wrong.
- I feel you.

15:21.133 --> 15:25.067
Hello?

15:25.067 --> 15:27.467
- Hi.
- Hi. Did you talk to

15:27.467 --> 15:29.767
- Mr. Odom yesterday?
- I did.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.233
- Okay.
- The

15:31.233 --> 15:33.467
basketball camp is right in the
heart of Santa Barbara.

15:33.467 --> 15:36.833
It's run by this doctor who
turned sports guru.

15:36.833 --> 15:40.000
I'm on the phone with
a dear friend of Lamar's, and he

15:40.000 --> 15:42.667
knows very much about this
basketball camp and he's been

15:42.667 --> 15:45.767
through it all with me and
Lamar, and so he knows exactly

15:45.767 --> 15:48.433
where I'm coming from and the
information that I need to

15:48.433 --> 15:50.900
- figure out what to do.
- I talked to

15:50.900 --> 15:52.933
Lamar recently.
I said I'm really bummed you're

15:52.933 --> 15:55.333
not taking everything else
seriously.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.933
Like, I'm seeing you going out,
you're not doing counseling.

15:57.933 --> 15:59.433
He just doesn't have a lot of
motivation.

15:59.433 --> 16:00.933
That's an
understatement.

16:00.933 --> 16:03.667
Now, maybe
this is a start.

16:03.667 --> 16:06.733
Why I liked it is 'cause
there's nothing to do up there.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.867
You know, Santa Barbara closes
early.

16:08.867 --> 16:12.000
- It's a very healthy environment.
- I'm obviously

16:12.000 --> 16:14.467
supportive if it's something
that's healthy, and even if it's

16:14.467 --> 16:16.900
something that, you know, would
get him in shape and make him

16:16.900 --> 16:19.233
feel good about himself, I'm all
for that.

16:19.233 --> 16:22.933
I do feel better that this is
something that he thinks Lamar

16:22.933 --> 16:27.567
should go and do.
I just want this to actually go

16:27.567 --> 16:31.700
as smoothly as I pray it goes.
Well, I will figure this out and

16:31.700 --> 16:34.633
I'll, uh, text you with some
information soon.

16:34.633 --> 16:37.267
- All right.
- Okay. Bye.

16:37.267 --> 16:40.200
- Bye.
- You got a hair.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.667
- I need to take a nap.
- Okay.

16:43.667 --> 16:46.200
Okay, I'm gonna start
now.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.300
Five, four, three,
two, one, done.

17:08.267 --> 17:10.567
Do you need coffee,
tea or anything?

17:10.567 --> 17:12.433
- Okay.
- Tea?

17:12.433 --> 17:14.567
Yeah.
You don't even know the drama

17:14.567 --> 17:16.700
- yesterday that was happening.
- What?

17:16.700 --> 17:20.933
- What happened?
- Like, um...

17:20.933 --> 17:23.367
Did you see the ChyMojis or
whatever?

17:23.367 --> 17:25.867
I didn't see them, but
I heard about them.

17:25.867 --> 17:30.100
Yesterday, Chyna's
emojis come out, and there's

17:30.100 --> 17:34.133
just some that we all don't even
know what to think about.

17:34.133 --> 17:38.033
It really threw me off.
There was, like, one of, um, her

17:38.033 --> 17:41.167
slapping Kylie.
Did you see it?

17:41.167 --> 17:43.700
No, I didn't see them.
Is it for sure Kylie though?

17:43.700 --> 17:46.300
That's, like, what
everyone was saying online.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.533
Just when everybody was trying
to be really accepting and

17:49.533 --> 17:54.000
welcoming Chyna into the family,
this comes out, and I think that

17:54.000 --> 17:58.067
we all are just, like, confused.
It says, "Surely that's not

17:58.067 --> 18:02.433
Kylie-- Blac Chyna slaps Jenner
look-alike in daring new emoji."

18:02.433 --> 18:05.967
And then, look, there's a
picture of her without...

18:05.967 --> 18:08.467
- That's Kylie.
- Totally. The lips.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.133
With the big lips,
yeah.

18:10.133 --> 18:12.233
It sent me over the
edge.

18:12.233 --> 18:16.333
Everything with Rob, I always
try to be super calm, but I was

18:16.333 --> 18:20.100
just, like, in a mood.
So I was gonna call Chyna, and

18:20.100 --> 18:23.233
then Kylie was like, "No, just
call Rob.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.900
Like, it's too crazy to call
Chyna."

18:24.900 --> 18:27.233
And I'm like, "I don't want to
yell at a pregnant person."

18:27.233 --> 18:29.233
So, wait, what did you
say to Rob?

18:29.233 --> 18:33.000
I yelled at him.
This is the first time that

18:33.000 --> 18:37.233
made me question Chyna's
intentions.

18:37.233 --> 18:40.800
Like, I usually don't let any
of this kind of stuff bother me.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.500
But for some reason, this just
sets me off.

18:43.500 --> 18:48.200
I just had to call Rob, and
Rob's like, "It's not Kylie.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.200
When has she ever slapped
Kylie?"

18:50.200 --> 18:54.033
And I'm like, "I don't know."
But, you know, I just really

18:54.033 --> 18:56.233
- upset him.
- But didn't he see

18:56.233 --> 18:58.233
that, didn't he see them, the
emojis?

18:58.233 --> 19:00.633
Yeah, but he's
like, "What do you care if

19:00.633 --> 19:03.433
she's, like, doing this?
Everyone has emojis."

19:03.433 --> 19:05.733
I'm like, "I don't care that she
has them.

19:05.733 --> 19:09.400
I care that it was Kylie."

19:09.400 --> 19:12.133
- Hey, Khlo.
- You okay?

19:12.133 --> 19:14.500
What is going on with all the
emojis?

19:14.500 --> 19:17.867
I showed Mario
Kylie, and he's like, "That is

19:17.867 --> 19:19.867
for sure Kylie."
All online's saying

19:19.867 --> 19:21.867
- it's Kylie.
- I went off on him

19:21.867 --> 19:24.533
yesterday.
He's like, "I'm gonna go on the

19:24.533 --> 19:27.267
red carpet tonight and I'm gonna
tell everybody how I have the

19:27.267 --> 19:30.467
worst, most unsupportive,
disgusting family."

19:30.467 --> 19:35.533
Like, ridiculous.
But I think that it's stupid to

19:35.533 --> 19:38.567
- take it there.
- I actually have a good

19:38.567 --> 19:40.900
tweet that I'm gonna do.
It's a subliminal, but...

19:40.900 --> 19:43.333
What... Your
subliminal tweets are not

19:43.333 --> 19:46.067
subliminal.
Okay, I'm out.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.967
Okay, love you.

19:57.033 --> 19:58.833
Oh, I really need
food. I'm like...

19:58.833 --> 20:00.233
So eat; there's so
much food in my fridge.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.767
I don't know what to
eat.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.400
I don't know what's
wrong with you.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.600
Maybe I'll try some
chicken risotto.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.100
I kind of want a sweet potato,
too.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.133
Okay.
There's only so much I can do

20:09.133 --> 20:11.500
- with one hand.
- Let's cut this open

20:11.500 --> 20:13.400
and see what it is.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.033
- What is that?
- It's chicken of some

20:18.033 --> 20:19.633
- sort.
- Doesn't look like

20:19.633 --> 20:21.233
- chicken to me.
- Oh, it doesn't?

20:21.233 --> 20:23.300
Well, I don't eat anything else
but chicken.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.033
- All right.
- My text was ruthless

20:26.033 --> 20:30.367
- yesterday, huh?
- Yeah.

20:30.367 --> 20:34.467
This emoji situation.
Can you believe Kourt got so

20:34.467 --> 20:36.800
- upset yesterday?
- Yeah, so upset.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.200
And for Kourtney to
get upset, you know it's a big

20:39.200 --> 20:41.933
- deal.
Mm-hmm.

20:41.933 --> 20:44.700
Aren't you upset that
Chyna made an emoji about you?

20:44.700 --> 20:46.767
You think that looks
like me-- with the thick brows

20:46.767 --> 20:51.600
and side bang and purple lips?
I've never worn that hairstyle

20:51.600 --> 20:53.600
- before, right?
- You've worn every

20:53.600 --> 20:55.600
- hairstyle.
- I really think it

20:55.600 --> 20:57.800
looks like this girl that she
hates that she had a public

20:57.800 --> 21:00.000
fight with.
There's so much

21:00.000 --> 21:03.533
misunderstanding going on.
I know everyone is really

21:03.533 --> 21:06.700
upset, but I talked to Chyna,
and I really don't think the

21:06.700 --> 21:09.200
emojis are me.
I'm really tired of my family

21:09.200 --> 21:11.700
fighting with Rob over every
little thing.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.967
He is expecting a baby, and it's
time for everyone to just be

21:14.967 --> 21:17.467
happy for him.
I just found out it's a lot

21:17.467 --> 21:20.233
easier when, like, everyone gets
along.

21:20.233 --> 21:22.600
I know I'll talk to
him again; it's my brother.

21:22.600 --> 21:26.067
So, who is this person
that cooks all this for you?

21:26.067 --> 21:30.167
- Mr. Odom's chef.
Mm-hmm.

21:30.167 --> 21:34.567
Um, yesterday, I
called Lam and I was like, "I'm

21:34.567 --> 21:36.567
looking for house rentals in
Santa Barbara."

21:36.567 --> 21:40.633
- Oh, wow.
- And then he was like,

21:40.633 --> 21:42.667
"I'm having really bad
cravings."

21:42.667 --> 21:44.200
And I was like, "You should talk
to someone.

21:44.200 --> 21:47.633
Like, I don't know how to help
you; like, I wish I did."

21:47.633 --> 21:50.233
- That's crazy.
- I want this for Lamar.

21:50.233 --> 21:52.600
Lamar has been really honest
about, you know, the thoughts

21:52.600 --> 21:57.500
he's been having, but, at the
same time, my answer to that is,

21:57.500 --> 21:59.700
like, I think you should see
someone that could help you

21:59.700 --> 22:02.600
with this.
But Lamar won't do that.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.533
And so that's really, again,
frustrating.

22:05.533 --> 22:08.900
You can't do anything if the
person's not willing to take

22:08.900 --> 22:14.167
control of their life and get
help.

22:14.167 --> 22:17.000
I've heard Kourtney
talk about all these little

22:17.000 --> 22:21.100
emojis about Chyna and whatnot.
There is, uh, such a bigger

22:21.100 --> 22:22.600
picture here we do need to
think about.

22:22.600 --> 22:26.033
It's like, what do we do
to keep it, like, just calm...

22:26.033 --> 22:29.433
- Civil?
- Yeah.

22:29.433 --> 22:33.167
Why is Scott being
so weird?

22:33.167 --> 22:35.833
I know it's all
psychological with Kourtney, so

22:35.833 --> 22:37.733
it's all BS.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.933
Have you gotten into
the new house yet or not?

22:50.933 --> 22:52.333
No, but now I'm in
escrow.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.333
Are you gonna be able
to gate your property now?

22:54.333 --> 22:56.767
Yeah.
And then, eventually, if I get

22:56.767 --> 22:59.933
older and I just always have
these properties, I could tear

22:59.933 --> 23:03.133
down the whole thing and, like,
build a house...

23:03.133 --> 23:05.700
Maybe you could attach
the two houses.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.367
- Yeah, like, something.
- And just make a

23:07.367 --> 23:12.200
compound, and then it just comes
through the middle.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.900
So what did you need
me for?

23:14.900 --> 23:17.967
I need you to help me
'cause I really truthfully

23:17.967 --> 23:21.667
believe that Kourtney has made
up in her head that she's

23:21.667 --> 23:25.067
highly allergic to every single
thing on the face of the planet.

23:25.067 --> 23:27.100
- I know.
- Now that Khloe's not

23:27.100 --> 23:30.033
gonna participate with switching
out all the foods to "the

23:30.033 --> 23:33.867
allergic stuff," I've decided
Kylie needs to be my accomplice

23:33.867 --> 23:36.667
here.
I mean, I trust her, and we'll

23:36.667 --> 23:39.467
see what happens.
She's just lost it.

23:39.467 --> 23:41.900
I don't even think she knows
what gluten is.

23:41.900 --> 23:43.900
I don't!
Do you?

23:43.900 --> 23:47.200
- No.
- Does anybody?

23:47.200 --> 23:50.100
- I'm sure.
- So, my point is, I'm

23:50.100 --> 23:53.933
saying, I want you to distract
her, I want to replace

23:53.933 --> 23:59.167
everything she has with regular
dairy, regular gluten, regular

23:59.167 --> 24:03.133
soy, and then we'll see the end
result.

24:03.133 --> 24:05.833
- Okay.
- That's it.

24:05.833 --> 24:17.933
- Plain and simple.
- Plain and simple.

24:17.933 --> 24:20.467
So, let's find her,
and then you distract her.

24:20.467 --> 24:22.467
And then I'll come back and get
the groceries.

24:22.467 --> 24:25.333
Smells like a
gluten-free grilled cheese.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.600
horse.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.633
- Kourtney?
- Hi.

24:30.633 --> 24:32.467
- Hey.
- Cutting P's nails.

24:32.467 --> 24:34.467
Aw.

24:34.467 --> 24:37.100
Hi, Paloosh.
So you're getting your nails

24:37.100 --> 24:39.100
- done?
Mm-hmm.

24:39.100 --> 24:41.100
You have a little gray
hair.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.100
- Do you want me to pull it out?
- No.

24:43.100 --> 24:45.100
- You like it?
- Live for them.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.933
- Okay.
- You want to get the

24:46.933 --> 24:48.700
- lipstick?
- All right, I'm gonna

24:48.700 --> 24:50.533
go down stairs and eat some
food.

24:50.533 --> 24:54.100
- I'll be back.
- You never eat here.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.733
- I have my lunch.
- Oh.

24:56.733 --> 24:58.633
It's salad.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.867
I know it's all psychological
with Kourtney thinking that she

25:03.867 --> 25:06.200
has all these allergies.
And she makes up these elaborate

25:06.200 --> 25:09.700
stories like, "Oh, well, this
one time I had gluten, and I

25:09.700 --> 25:11.700
had a little goose bump on my
arm."

25:11.700 --> 25:13.700
I'm like, "Maybe that's just
'cause you're wearing a T-shirt,

25:13.700 --> 25:15.700
and you're in the middle of a
ski mountain."

25:15.700 --> 25:17.800
So I definitely think this is
someplace where I can prove to

25:17.800 --> 25:20.700
her that it's not real, then.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.100
Why is Scott being
so weird?

25:33.100 --> 25:35.333
Should we go down there?

25:35.333 --> 25:37.267
Mm...

25:42.267 --> 25:44.267
I'm just gonna tell
you.

25:44.267 --> 25:46.267
- What?
- 'Cause I feel awkward.

25:46.267 --> 25:48.867
- What?
- But he's-he's...

25:48.867 --> 25:52.867
He's switching your food
downstairs.

25:52.867 --> 25:55.500
- My food?
- 'Cause he thinks that

25:55.500 --> 25:57.600
your gluten allergy is, like,
a joke, so he...

25:57.600 --> 25:59.433
- Yeah, he does.
- So he's switching all

25:59.433 --> 26:03.133
- of them.
- Scott just doesn't

26:03.133 --> 26:06.800
understand why me and the kids
have to be gluten-free,

26:06.800 --> 26:11.067
dairy-free, and it may not seem
like a big deal, but it's,

26:11.067 --> 26:15.967
like, an allergy, so I...
It's just annoying.

26:15.967 --> 26:19.267
By the way, like, he should know
of anyone.

26:19.267 --> 26:21.067
- He's lactose-intolerant.
- And I just want to

26:21.067 --> 26:23.333
tell you, 'cause, like, I don't
know if you're, like, really

26:23.333 --> 26:25.733
allergic and something might
happen.

26:25.733 --> 26:27.967
He, like, doesn't
believe me, so he'll go against

26:27.967 --> 26:30.833
- my ways.
- Yeah.

26:30.833 --> 26:32.900
Okay, don't tell
him that I know.

26:32.900 --> 26:36.800
- Okay.
- Blood.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.933
Blood is thicker than water.

26:51.633 --> 26:53.000
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Kim.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.400
- How are you?
- How are you, babe?

26:54.400 --> 26:56.800
Good to see you.
I'm gonna sit over here.

26:56.800 --> 26:59.533
- So I can gaze into your eyes.
- What took you so long?

26:59.533 --> 27:01.400
- There was a lot of traffic.
- I was at a doctor's--

27:01.400 --> 27:02.967
There was, like, coming from
Beverly Hills.

27:02.967 --> 27:04.533
- So much. So much.
- Like, there's so much

27:04.533 --> 27:06.067
- traffic here all the time.
- Rodeo was, like, shut

27:06.067 --> 27:07.333
down.
'Cause we were over there

27:07.333 --> 27:08.333
- shopping.
- Yeah.

27:08.333 --> 27:10.467
I was, like, right near
there.

27:10.467 --> 27:13.533
Uh, we'll take some

27:13.533 --> 27:17.233
Brussels sprouts, sounds good.
So, you know, I've heard

27:17.233 --> 27:21.500
Kourtney talk about all these
little emojis about Chyna and

27:21.500 --> 27:23.800
whatnot.
And I said to Kourt, I go,

27:23.800 --> 27:27.467
"But in all honesty, like, there
is such a bigger picture here we

27:27.467 --> 27:31.100
do need to think about.
Like, your brother, whether what

27:31.100 --> 27:34.067
terms everyone's on with him, is
gonna have a child with this

27:34.067 --> 27:36.933
woman for the rest of his life.
That's it."

27:36.933 --> 27:38.467
- Yeah.
- Like, forget it, who

27:38.467 --> 27:40.033
cares?
Like, there's a bigger picture.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.333
- Right.
- And I told Kourtney

27:41.333 --> 27:43.167
and she was like, "All right,
I'm still annoyed."

27:43.167 --> 27:45.600
I think that Scott is
right.

27:45.600 --> 27:49.367
We all love my brother, we're
so happy for him that he's, you

27:49.367 --> 27:52.500
know, having a baby, so I think
I need to talk to Kourtney.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.900
She needs to just, like, sit
back, be supportive, so everyone

27:55.900 --> 27:59.067
is happy.
It's like, what do we do to

27:59.067 --> 28:01.600
- keep it, like, just calm...
- Civil?

28:01.600 --> 28:06.300
- Yeah.
- Nothing's gonna wake

28:06.300 --> 28:08.267
him up.
That's where the biggest problem

28:08.267 --> 28:09.600
- is.
- Okay.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.867
So, I thought he was
really gonna change, but, like,

28:12.867 --> 28:16.367
- this is Lamar.
- Scott switched out

28:16.367 --> 28:19.833
our non-dairy milk with real
milk.

28:19.833 --> 28:22.533
I feel like I can pretend to be
really sick.

28:22.533 --> 28:29.067
That's a good one.

28:34.333 --> 28:37.067
Where can I take a good
selfie in the mirror?

28:37.067 --> 28:38.900
- This one?
- I don't know.

28:38.900 --> 28:41.833
- I've never done one there.
- Kourtney, you do this

28:41.833 --> 28:45.967
here on a daily basis.

28:45.967 --> 28:47.900
Can we go outside?

28:52.467 --> 28:55.567
So did you get a chance
to talk to Rob?

28:55.567 --> 28:59.167
I haven't really
talked to him since we got into

28:59.167 --> 29:02.600
- that fight when I yelled at him.
- Yeah, I cannot believe

29:02.600 --> 29:04.633
you haven't talked to him since
then, and I cannot believe he

29:04.633 --> 29:08.600
hasn't cared enough to call you.
I feel like this is so

29:08.600 --> 29:12.000
ridiculous, and I think we all
just need to, like, get over it.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.900
You know?

29:17.267 --> 29:19.567
Well, it's like,
even, like, I know what it's

29:19.567 --> 29:23.633
like to be, like, having your
first baby and people aren't

29:23.633 --> 29:26.300
supportive.
Took, like, years for people to

29:26.300 --> 29:28.800
- like Scott.
- True.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.067
But I just wanted to at least,
like, get you guys on the phone

29:31.067 --> 29:33.800
so we could not have any kind of
drama.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.600
- Yeah.
- Do you want me to call?

29:36.600 --> 29:38.733
Call and see if he
answers.

29:38.733 --> 29:42.233
I think Kim is

29:42.233 --> 29:46.267
right; I mean, I should've
asked Rob what was going on

29:46.267 --> 29:49.967
instead of just getting so
angry and assume that certain

29:49.967 --> 29:52.433
things were true.
And I just want to hear what

29:52.433 --> 29:56.700
Rob says.
I'm hoping that he wants to

29:56.700 --> 30:00.067
make it a peaceful situation as
well.

30:00.067 --> 30:04.067
He's not answering.

30:04.067 --> 30:06.067
I'm sorry,
the person you are trying to

30:06.067 --> 30:08.100
reach has a voice mailbox...

30:11.267 --> 30:14.833
So what do we do if
Rob's not gonna answer?

30:14.833 --> 30:16.733
I don't know.

30:29.367 --> 30:31.633
- Here we are, guys.
- Mase, do you mind

30:31.633 --> 30:33.967
switching?
P, you didn't tell Lovey what

30:33.967 --> 30:36.900
- you did.
- What'd you do?

30:36.900 --> 30:41.000
Just look at her
and tell me if you can notice.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.800
Want to go under the table?

30:42.800 --> 30:46.167
I just noticed!
Did you get your ears pierced?

30:46.167 --> 30:49.267
We're gonna switch
so you can sit here, okay?

30:49.267 --> 30:52.933
Let me look at you.
Wait, no feet on the table,

30:52.933 --> 30:54.267
Kourt.
Up. Pick her up.

30:54.267 --> 30:57.567
- Here.
- They're so beautiful.

30:57.567 --> 31:00.000
Let me look at them
to make sure they look okay.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
- Did it hurt?
- No.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.400
- I didn't cry.
- She didn't even

31:05.400 --> 31:06.600
- move.
- You didn't cry?

31:06.600 --> 31:08.000
- Nothing, right?
- What?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.800
- Just a little bit.
- Mase, what do you

31:10.800 --> 31:12.800
feel like?
Gluten-free pasta?

31:12.800 --> 31:15.900
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:15.900 --> 31:20.233
So, Scott was over the other
day and saying that, like, our

31:20.233 --> 31:23.700
allergies aren't real and that
we don't need to be on that

31:23.700 --> 31:26.733
diet.
So anyways, he came over and,

31:26.733 --> 31:31.733
like, switched out our non-dairy
milk with real milk.

31:31.733 --> 31:35.167
But then Kylie told me before
we even had it.

31:35.167 --> 31:37.333
Did you tell him?
That you found out?

31:37.333 --> 31:39.033
Mm-mm.

31:39.033 --> 31:42.367
I feel like I could pretend
to be really sick.

31:42.367 --> 31:45.533
That's a good one.
I think you should say that

31:45.533 --> 31:50.233
you're super sick and you have
to go to the doctor's.

31:50.233 --> 31:53.033
Scott, in a million

31:53.033 --> 31:56.667
years, would never think that I
would get sick, so it is, like,

31:56.667 --> 32:00.367
a great opportunity to just get
to make him feel bad,

32:00.367 --> 32:03.933
because he just needs to learn
a lesson to, like, get out of my

32:03.933 --> 32:06.700
business about, like, what I'm
eating.

32:06.700 --> 32:11.733
That is amazing.
Payback is a bitch.

32:11.733 --> 32:14.500
Hey, watch your
language.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.067
Oh, my God.
Between the food and the

32:17.067 --> 32:19.633
non-cussing, I would go crazy.

32:31.067 --> 32:33.533
- Hi.
- Hey, Khloe.

32:33.533 --> 32:35.200
I know exactly who
that is.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.133
So do you
know if he's shady?

32:37.133 --> 32:40.400
I know he was around
during, like, a b-bizarre time,

32:40.400 --> 32:44.433
but I don't know for sure.
One of Lamar's friends has

32:44.433 --> 32:47.767
called me and is, you know,
notifying me that Lamar is

32:47.767 --> 32:49.900
hanging out with bad guys
again.

32:49.900 --> 32:53.233
And it saddens me.
I know Lamar wants better, I

32:53.233 --> 32:57.200
know Lamar wants to excel and
be on a good path, but he just

32:57.200 --> 32:59.800
can't help it.
I'm just at a loss of, like, so

32:59.800 --> 33:02.433
what do we do anyway?
I've tried every single thing.

33:02.433 --> 33:04.567
I know you
have.

33:04.567 --> 33:06.767
Nothing's gonna wake
him up.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.900
That's where the biggest problem
is.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.767
- Wow.
- I thought he was

33:10.767 --> 33:15.367
really gonna change, but, like,
this is Lamar.

33:15.367 --> 33:16.967
The negative
assumptions, it's just not

33:16.967 --> 33:19.100
necessary.
It's just, talk to me normally

33:19.100 --> 33:21.733
and calmly.
I don't come screaming at any of

33:21.733 --> 33:24.467
you guys for anything that you
guys have done ever in your

33:24.467 --> 33:26.967
- life.
- What's the problem?

33:26.967 --> 33:29.400
Got to come see
Kourtney because I don't know

33:29.400 --> 33:33.300
what's wrong, and one of us has
to take her to the hospital.

33:33.300 --> 33:36.100
I think she's eaten something
that she's not-- that's not

33:36.100 --> 33:38.000
agreeing with her.

33:49.667 --> 33:51.667
- Kris.
- Yeah?

33:51.667 --> 33:53.400
- What is going on?
- God, I thought you'd

33:53.400 --> 33:54.900
- never get here.
- What do you mean

33:54.900 --> 33:56.800
"never get here"?
I just drove 100 miles an hour

33:56.800 --> 33:58.467
- to get here.
- You've got to come see

33:58.467 --> 34:01.567
Kourtney because I don't know
what's wrong, and one of us has

34:01.567 --> 34:06.167
- to take her to the hospital.
- What's the problem?

34:06.167 --> 34:10.333
Honey, are you okay?

34:10.333 --> 34:13.033
I think she's eaten something
that she's not-- that's not

34:13.033 --> 34:14.933
agreeing with her.

34:19.800 --> 34:22.767
She's fine.
Are you guys kidding?

34:22.767 --> 34:26.367
Kourtney sucks at this.
And I don't want to be her

34:26.367 --> 34:29.567
partner in crime anymore.
I mean, this is epic, but

34:29.567 --> 34:32.900
Kourtney's like, "Whatever."
She's just not a very good

34:32.900 --> 34:36.800
- actor.
- Hello?

34:36.800 --> 34:38.367
She's fine.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.267
What the-- what's wrong
with you?

34:40.267 --> 34:42.400
There's nothing wrong

34:42.400 --> 34:45.000
- with this kid.
- This is ridiculous.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.733
She doesn't look sick, she's
just decked out, hair and

34:47.733 --> 34:50.000
makeup.
I mean, looks like she's going

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
- to the Oscars.
- But don't mess with

34:52.000 --> 34:56.567
- me and my food.
- How did you catch it?

34:56.567 --> 34:58.400
- Kylie.
- Kylie told you?

34:58.400 --> 35:01.033
But just because
it's like, it's a choice.

35:01.033 --> 35:03.300
But I don't think it's
fair to tell everyone you're

35:03.300 --> 35:05.567
allergic to all these things.
And then go have a glass of milk

35:05.567 --> 35:08.033
or eat a big ice cream and be
like, "Oh, it's a cheat day."

35:08.033 --> 35:11.833
You can't cheat on allergies.
The fact that she thinks that

35:11.833 --> 35:15.700
she can take "off days" of
being allergic, that doesn't

35:15.700 --> 35:18.800
work in America, lady.
Or anywhere else in this world.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.667
It's absolutely ridiculous, and
I'm appalled.

35:21.667 --> 35:25.000
Listen.
Some people choose to be vegans;

35:25.000 --> 35:27.233
some people choose to be
vegetarian.

35:27.233 --> 35:28.967
- Great.
- We are choosing

35:28.967 --> 35:30.567
- to be dairy-free.
- You're choosing to

35:30.567 --> 35:32.867
lie and say you're allergic.
That's fair, too.

35:32.867 --> 35:35.433
It's her choice.
She's-- maybe just don't use the

35:35.433 --> 35:38.433
word "allergic."
Since Scott is

35:38.433 --> 35:43.367
being ridiculous, I won't call
my diet restrictions an

35:43.367 --> 35:46.567
allergy, since that seems to
be offending Scott.

35:46.567 --> 35:50.500
I'll just say that it's, like, a
healthy lifestyle.

35:50.500 --> 35:51.767
- Okay.
I-I agree.

35:51.767 --> 35:53.967
Mom, you have so
many different styles going on

35:53.967 --> 35:55.733
- in your house...
- Here we go.

35:55.733 --> 35:57.233
- ...of decor.
- First of all, step

35:57.233 --> 35:59.733
outside of here, you'll see a
mid-century room, then you'll

35:59.733 --> 36:02.667
see a colonial and Old English,
and a horse stable on the other

36:02.667 --> 36:04.433
side.
I'm almost allergic to how many

36:04.433 --> 36:06.233
different styles you have in
this house.

36:06.233 --> 36:08.267
I-I just can't.

36:08.267 --> 36:10.400
- I can't. I can't.
- No, but it's so me.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.500
I wish you guys well.
I really do.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.333
I hope you work things out, but
I'm gonna go back.

36:15.333 --> 36:17.267
With what, her
allergies?

36:17.267 --> 36:31.667
- Or the whole break-up thing?
- I need a vodka.

36:31.667 --> 36:35.300
- Hey, Kimbo.
- Ricky.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.667
Aren't slides, like, your
favorite?

36:37.667 --> 36:39.667
It's the only
shoes I wear.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.433
- I love them.
- I need new ones.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.133
Well, I called you over
here because I just wanted to,

36:44.133 --> 36:47.533
like, get Kourt on the phone for
a sec, because I feel like your

36:47.533 --> 36:51.200
fight with her, obviously, you
guys should talk about it.

36:51.200 --> 36:57.500
Okay.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.467
I'm here with Rob, and I know
you guys, like, haven't spoken

37:03.467 --> 37:06.600
- since your little fight.
- Okay, yeah.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.667
And I think we all just
need to, like, get over it and

37:09.667 --> 37:12.333
- move on.
- It's just that the

37:12.333 --> 37:14.400
assumptions, like, the negative
assumptions...

37:14.400 --> 37:16.167
- Yeah.
- It's just not necessary.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.833
It's just, talk to me normally
and calmly.

37:18.833 --> 37:21.467
Because I don't come screaming
at any of you guys for anything

37:21.467 --> 37:25.700
that you guys have done ever in
your life.

37:25.700 --> 37:29.400
Maybe you shouldn't put

37:29.400 --> 37:32.267
- so much energy into it.
- And it feels so

37:32.267 --> 37:34.600
good to let it go, but it's
hard.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.667
Well, with Lamar, I
feel really strongly there's

37:37.667 --> 37:39.567
only one outcome.

37:43.067 --> 37:44.600
It's just that the
assumptions, like, the negative

37:44.600 --> 37:45.967
- assumptions...
- Yeah.

37:45.967 --> 37:48.733
It's just not necessary.
It's just, talk to me normally

37:48.733 --> 37:51.367
and calmly.
Because I don't come screaming

37:51.367 --> 37:54.133
at any of you guys for anything
that you guys have done ever in

37:54.133 --> 37:55.967
- your life.
- But that's what

37:55.967 --> 37:57.733
- siblings do.
- What?

37:57.733 --> 38:03.900
Then we make up two
seconds later.

38:03.900 --> 38:08.467
I apologize for just making
accusations.

38:08.467 --> 38:10.800
Nah, it's all good.
I just-- we don't need to be

38:10.800 --> 38:13.233
fighting over some pettiest,
dumbest  in the world,

38:13.233 --> 38:16.733
- so...
- I agree.

38:16.733 --> 38:20.000
There's no reason for
there to be any drama, really.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.800
I mean, Bob has come such a long
way and he's had such positive

38:23.800 --> 38:26.700
improvements.
I think Kourtney and I, we just

38:26.700 --> 38:29.533
want him to feel like we love
him and we're supporting him.

38:29.533 --> 38:32.833
And I'm just glad that they can
work it out, 'cause at the end

38:32.833 --> 38:36.333
of the day, we just want to be a
family that will always be there

38:36.333 --> 38:39.733
to support each other no matter
what.

38:39.733 --> 38:42.133
I'm excited
for this new chapter in your

38:42.133 --> 38:45.500
life, and I'm excited for you to
join Club Kourtney and Kim.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.967
That's right, it's a
really good club.

38:47.967 --> 38:49.900
It's, like, the best
club.

38:49.900 --> 38:51.800
Yay.

38:59.300 --> 39:01.733
I want to show you
something.

39:01.733 --> 39:03.600
- I did that.
- Ooh.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.933
And that.

39:04.933 --> 39:08.533
Mase, that guy's the best.
With that heart.

39:08.533 --> 39:11.033
I'm gonna make them
mermen.

39:11.033 --> 39:16.867
That's so good.
Well, I love this mermaid.

39:16.867 --> 39:19.200
- Do you know all these states?
- No.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.000
You're not even
looking at them.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.267
How was your night?
What did you do?

39:24.267 --> 39:28.033
Honestly, Kim, I-I
don't want to talk about it.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.500
It was, like, five steps
backwards.

39:30.500 --> 39:34.233
- I don't even know what to do.
- How crazy.

39:34.233 --> 39:36.667
And I said, "You know,
like, you could die right now,

39:36.667 --> 39:41.100
right?"
Lamar and I talked about the

39:41.100 --> 39:43.433
demons he's been battling
recently.

39:43.433 --> 39:46.867
And he doesn't realize how
erratic I think he's acting,

39:46.867 --> 39:49.267
'cause it-- he can't help it.
And I'm just like, "God, I

39:49.267 --> 39:51.167
thought all this was over."

39:59.133 --> 40:00.767
It was, like, five steps
backwards.

40:00.767 --> 40:02.667
- I don't even know what to do.
- How crazy.

40:02.667 --> 40:05.100
And I said, "You know,
like, you could die right now,

40:05.100 --> 40:09.567
right?"
It's just so stupid.

40:09.567 --> 40:12.133
I'll go over there today
if you want, and I can talk to

40:12.133 --> 40:19.833
him, or I can, like, have Kanye
come and help talk to him.

40:19.833 --> 40:25.233
Like, why do I treat
him better than I treat myself?

40:25.233 --> 40:28.700
I mean, I feel like
maybe you shouldn't put so much

40:28.700 --> 40:31.700
energy into it.
You know, you'll always be

40:31.700 --> 40:36.000
there, but you can't, you know,
baby him and be his, like, mom.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.767
Like, with Scott,
like, it's like, I don't tell

40:38.767 --> 40:43.600
him, "Don't do this or that."
And it feels so good to let it

40:43.600 --> 40:46.300
go, but it's hard because at the
same time, you don't want the

40:46.300 --> 40:50.567
- person to die.
- Well, that's just

40:50.567 --> 40:52.467
what's gonna happen.

40:56.500 --> 41:01.400
I feel really strongly there's
only one outcome.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.567
You know, I've always hoped that
Lamar seeing everyone that

41:04.567 --> 41:07.400
rallied around him during a dark
time and everyone who's rooting

41:07.400 --> 41:10.367
for a comeback story and
everyone that wants to see Lamar

41:10.367 --> 41:14.933
do well and just succeed in
life, just win at the game of

41:14.933 --> 41:19.600
life-- I think that's where I
always put all my eggs into that

41:19.600 --> 41:21.933
basket.
And it-- whether it be my

41:21.933 --> 41:24.933
personal family, or the fans of
the world, or just everyone

41:24.933 --> 41:27.967
that's praying for him, it
really is so moving how much

41:27.967 --> 41:33.133
everyone was rooting for Lamar.
Except him.

41:33.133 --> 41:36.433
- So it is disappointing.
- I just think, in your

41:36.433 --> 41:40.967
mind, you have to be, like,
prepared for the worst.

41:40.967 --> 41:42.867
And try your best.

41:56.333 --> 41:59.567
You know you gave
me these jeans a long time ago?

41:59.567 --> 42:01.933
Oh, my God.
Those are the jeans that I wore

42:01.933 --> 42:04.033
- when I was in Spain.
- I love them.

42:04.033 --> 42:06.333
They're a 27, but, like, they
fit me.

42:06.333 --> 42:08.633
So, like, they would
never fit me, but my goal was

42:08.633 --> 42:10.400
- just to see...
- These would never

42:10.400 --> 42:11.667
- fit you.
- I know, I know.

42:11.667 --> 42:13.800
But I'm saying, like, in, like,
six months.

42:13.800 --> 42:18.100
What are we gonna do about,
like, Khloe and Lamar?

42:18.100 --> 42:21.600
I feel like she just, like, did
so much thinking, like, this was

42:21.600 --> 42:24.167
it and, like, they're gonna get
back together and, like, she's

42:24.167 --> 42:27.500
- gonna, like, help save him.
- I don't think she

42:27.500 --> 42:29.167
- thought that.
- Really?

42:29.167 --> 42:30.900
- No.
- I think, deep down

42:30.900 --> 42:33.233
inside, she thought, like,
"What if this works out?"

42:33.233 --> 42:34.700
- I don't.
- Really?

42:34.700 --> 42:36.467
- I don't.
- Ugh, I so think that.

42:36.467 --> 42:39.133
She-- I don't
think she thinks, "I want to

42:39.133 --> 42:41.400
spend my life with him and have
kids with him."

42:41.400 --> 42:44.667
Because, like, where's the
trust?

42:44.667 --> 42:46.500
- And where's...
- The normalcy?

42:46.500 --> 42:49.233
I just don't think
that's the situation she wants.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.867
Yeah, but I think she
feels, like, tied to him.

42:51.867 --> 42:54.700
Of course.
She feels tied to him, and she

42:54.700 --> 42:57.933
feels responsible, and she feels
like she's all he has.

42:57.933 --> 43:00.967
- Yeah, totally.
- When it comes to

43:00.967 --> 43:04.833
Lamar, I know that Khloe has,
you know, been through it all

43:04.833 --> 43:07.133
with him.
Khloe has given everything;

43:07.133 --> 43:10.100
she's tried everything.
You know, I can give her as

43:10.100 --> 43:14.633
much advice as I can, but,
like, there's only so much

43:14.633 --> 43:19.333
that she can do.
Keeping Up with the

43:19.333 --> 43:21.900
Kardashians...
I don't want to send him the

43:21.900 --> 43:25.233
wrong message.
Scott invited me to his birthday

43:25.233 --> 43:31.600
party in Las Vegas.
Ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah!

43:31.600 --> 43:32.967
So have you talked to
Khloe lately?

43:32.967 --> 43:34.600
- No.
- She misses her brother.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.567
She should be careful
what she says.

43:36.567 --> 43:39.367
And you all aren't welcoming
of this relationship, so it's

43:39.367 --> 43:42.200
- not that easy.
- I've missed you.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.733
Why won't you even look at me?

43:44.733 --> 43:47.633
