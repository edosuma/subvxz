WEBVTT

02:40.326 --> 02:43.203
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, it's Chicken-Noodle Campbell.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.830
Shouldn't you be sittin' in a high chair?

02:45.122 --> 02:46.164
Coroner's report.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.083
Why don't you just try crack?

02:48.376 --> 02:49.585
You call that humor?

02:49.877 --> 02:52.087
The Captain says no more 976 calls.

03:05.935 --> 03:09.396
Mr. Love Beads, you'll have to seek
higher enlightenment somewhere else.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.649
I'm Lieutenant Cole.
Been assigned to the case.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.150
They asked me to come
and look at the file.

03:13.442 --> 03:15.402
Didn't mean to be discourteous.
Nice to meet you.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.863
I heard about you.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

03:18.155 --> 03:20.866
You worked in New York, right?
DeMarco killings?

03:21.158 --> 03:23.827
This ain't New York and this
ain't the DeMarco killings.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.955
We work as a team around here.

03:26.414 --> 03:30.000
You know, the way I work is
I just like to solve the case.

03:30.292 --> 03:32.252
I don't even care who gets the credit.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.421
Beautiful. That's that.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.673
We call this guy, "The Family Man. "

03:36.966 --> 03:39.385
He's killed six families
in the last eight months.

03:39.677 --> 03:40.761
All ritual killings.

03:41.053 --> 03:43.889
Have you found any connection
between the victims at all?

03:44.181 --> 03:46.391
Other than the fact
that they're all Catholic...

03:46.684 --> 03:48.686
...which ties into the
crucifixion ritual, no.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.896
They just found two more.

03:53.065 --> 03:56.109
Fresh kill. Today's your lucky day. Let's go.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.845
This ain't the same, Jim.

04:23.971 --> 04:26.264
Yeah, this is the first one in a motel.

04:26.807 --> 04:29.184
All the rest have taken place in their houses.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.687
Normally, we can ID the couple, but...

04:32.104 --> 04:34.898
...other than that,
it's pretty much the same MO.

04:39.320 --> 04:43.157
No, there's a lot more than that goin' on.
I mean, this is different.

04:48.245 --> 04:49.829
Are you married or what?

04:50.122 --> 04:51.957
This is what I hate about new partners.

04:52.249 --> 04:54.251
They always want to get personal.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.629
I don't want to talk about it, all right?

04:59.131 --> 05:01.716
Forget that I ever mentioned anything at all.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.179
Are you married, or what?

05:06.430 --> 05:07.848
No, I'm not married.

05:08.224 --> 05:11.393
Every cop I know who's married,
has a wife who won't sleep with him...

05:11.685 --> 05:12.686
...two kids who don't listen to him...

05:12.978 --> 05:15.313
...and a dog that'd rather lick
himself than fetch the paper.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.191
<i>All units respond to a barricaded
suspect with hostages...</i>

05:18.484 --> 05:19.735
<i>...at the Saint Edmund's School.</i>

05:20.027 --> 05:22.529
<i>- Possible suicide.</i>
- Yeah, we're in that area.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.532
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- It's right over here.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.077
No, man. That's suicide. We're Homicide.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.038
If some dumb ass wants to jump
off a buildin', that's his problem.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.623
Somebody pushes his ass
off a buildin', then call me.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.460
The way I look at it, death is death.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.046
We gotta have compassion
for the dead, the dying...

05:39.338 --> 05:41.256
...the could-be-dying
and the about-to-be-dead.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.008
I'm going. I'm going.

06:05.781 --> 06:07.908
Faster, come on. Quickly, quickly.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.662
Detective Cole. Detective Campbell.
What have we got?

06:11.954 --> 06:13.664
A boy named Johnny Deverell.
He's a senior.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.749
He's got a gun and a class full of kids.

06:16.041 --> 06:16.916
That's nice.

06:17.209 --> 06:18.960
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

06:19.253 --> 06:22.547
His girlfriend broke up with him.
He's got her up there too.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.508
Has he been in trouble before?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.427
He was arrested for drugs.
They had him seeing a therapist.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.055
Yeah, must have been the wrong therapist.

06:30.347 --> 06:32.891
Keep everybody quiet.
Keep everybody back.

06:35.352 --> 06:37.312
Man, you know this ain't our gig.

06:37.605 --> 06:38.897
Look, it's a love-sick kid.

06:39.189 --> 06:41.733
A well-armed, love-sick kid.
Why do you think they got SWAT?

06:42.026 --> 06:43.527
Cause they look good in black.

06:43.819 --> 06:47.405
See if you can get me a couple
of cell phones right away.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.536
Johnny, please stop it.
They're gonna hurt you.

06:52.828 --> 06:56.122
Shut your mouth, Millie!
I'm not in the mood for this!

06:56.415 --> 06:57.290
Put the gun down, Johnny.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.585
- Just put it down!
- Shut up!

07:03.088 --> 07:05.173
Johnny, stop it! Please, Johnny!

07:07.468 --> 07:09.678
<i>This is Detective Cole, LAPD.</i>

07:10.554 --> 07:13.181
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm here to help you.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.017
I gotta get into a dialogue with you...

07:15.309 --> 07:19.313
<i>...before the guys in black get here,
'cause they don't listen to anybody.</i>

07:20.356 --> 07:22.232
<i>I don't want you to get hurt.</i>

07:24.443 --> 07:27.446
<i>I want you to step over to
the window and look at me.</i>

07:27.947 --> 07:29.782
You'll see that I'm unarmed.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.994
Nobody move!

07:35.955 --> 07:39.458
Come on over. Step over to
the window and look at me.

07:45.464 --> 07:47.674
Sorry, Johnny. Put the gun down.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.219
I don't want to shoot you,
and you don't want to be dead.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.346
Why not?

07:52.638 --> 07:54.222
Drop the gun! Come on.

07:56.433 --> 07:57.725
What are you on?

07:58.018 --> 07:59.519
Don't talk to me like you know me!

07:59.812 --> 08:01.647
You want me to start shooting?

08:09.822 --> 08:11.406
You're right, I don't know you.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.409
I'm gonna put my gun down.

08:14.910 --> 08:16.620
We'll start out like this.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.414
Now, what's the problem?

08:19.707 --> 08:21.375
You don't understand, man.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.628
You don't understand.
I can't go back with him.

08:25.421 --> 08:26.422
I can't, I won't.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.256
With who?

08:27.548 --> 08:30.551
You don't understand.
I can't go back with him.

08:30.926 --> 08:31.551
With who?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.428
I can't. I won't.

08:43.355 --> 08:44.773
I love you, Johnny!

08:46.191 --> 08:47.692
I love you, too.

08:49.528 --> 08:50.946
I love you, too.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.116
I hate this job.

08:55.242 --> 08:56.493
- Calm down, son.
- Wait!

08:56.785 --> 08:58.870
Watch your head. Calm down.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.873
Now, you see? SWAT would
have killed this boy.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.834
You know it, and I know it.

09:04.209 --> 09:06.544
- You're not a freelancer, okay?
- Oh, no.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.463
This ain't New York.

09:08.756 --> 09:09.590
No shit.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.057
Frank Deverell. It figures.

09:20.225 --> 09:22.185
Rich people's kids are always fucked up.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.480
Lieutenant, where will I find Detective Cole?

09:24.772 --> 09:26.940
- Right down there, sir.
- Thank you.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.819
- Detective Cole?
- Yes, sir.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.198
I'd like to thank you
from the bottom of my heart...

09:34.490 --> 09:37.075
...for not letting my stepson
take his own life.

09:37.367 --> 09:40.161
You look like a very sincere
individual, and I...

09:40.746 --> 09:44.249
...really appreciate your
coming down. So nice of you.

09:45.876 --> 09:49.796
Well, I sincerely hope that if there's
ever anything I can do for you...

09:50.089 --> 09:52.007
...you won't hesitate to ask me.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.760
You'll be the first one I dial.

09:55.260 --> 09:56.803
Let's get out of here.

10:01.433 --> 10:02.434
Nice coat.

10:09.691 --> 10:11.943
Detective Cole, can I have a minute?

10:13.153 --> 10:14.195
I'm kind of busy right now.

10:14.488 --> 10:17.741
I'll be very brief. Mr. Deverell
asked me to speak to you...

10:18.033 --> 10:19.951
...on behalf of his stepson.

10:20.452 --> 10:21.327
About what?

10:21.620 --> 10:24.247
Mr. Deverell feels your testimony
would be very helpful...

10:24.540 --> 10:27.543
...in getting Johnny acquitted on
grounds of temporary insanity.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.963
There's a little problem.
First of all, I don't think he's insane.

10:31.255 --> 10:34.341
Second of all, I like to testify
as to what actually happened.

10:34.633 --> 10:35.925
Look, Detective...

10:38.137 --> 10:41.348
...Johnny's been going
through a very difficult time.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.892
He needs treatment, not prison.

10:46.228 --> 10:48.271
Now, Mr. Deverell, as you may know...

10:48.564 --> 10:52.234
...he's a very important man,
and a man with a lot of influence...

10:52.526 --> 10:54.986
...a man who could help or hurt a career.

10:57.197 --> 10:59.657
Just what is it that you do for this man?

11:00.367 --> 11:02.827
I'm in charge of Mr. Deverell's security.

11:04.454 --> 11:07.081
Could have fooled me.
I thought you were an attorney.

11:07.374 --> 11:09.292
I want you to deliver a message for me.

11:09.585 --> 11:13.338
You tell your asshole boss that
nobody, nobody threatens me.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.760
I understand. I'll convey your
feelings to Mr. Deverell.

11:19.052 --> 11:22.472
Now get your ugly, white ass
out of here. And don't come back.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.564
The motel victim had some problems...

11:31.857 --> 11:33.817
...I thought you might want to know about.

11:34.109 --> 11:36.528
Besides bein' shot in the head and crucified?

11:36.820 --> 11:38.655
What are you gonna tell me,
she had a bad-hair day?

11:38.947 --> 11:41.532
She would have been dead
in a couple of months.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.326
From what?

11:43.952 --> 11:47.538
I found advanced osteosarcoma
and interstitial fibrosis.

11:48.624 --> 11:52.002
If you don't say it in English, I'll
beat you to death with a dictionary.

11:52.294 --> 11:56.256
It's a rare form of bone cancer, and this
cancer had spread throughout her body.

11:56.548 --> 11:58.800
- What'd cause that?
- What am I? The Amazing Randy?

11:59.092 --> 12:01.427
We have tests to run, it will take time.

12:01.845 --> 12:03.513
What'd you come up with on prints?

12:03.805 --> 12:06.265
Nothing. I don't think she's local.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.603
Neither do I. I don't even
think she's American.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.605
I think she's Russian.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.774
Wait, I thought he was the Amazing Randy.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.777
Hair... cheekbones...

12:18.237 --> 12:22.199
...genetic bone structure. I think
she's Russian, most likely Georgian.

12:22.741 --> 12:25.326
You can tell all that
just by lookin' at her?

12:26.578 --> 12:28.955
Right. She's an Aquarius
and likes country music.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.499
Was... an Aquarian.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.001
You see, the spirit has left the body.

12:33.293 --> 12:36.087
What we have here
is a mere broken vessel.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.049
"A broken vessel?"

12:39.341 --> 12:43.386
Anything else interesting about the body
that you'd like to comment on or...

12:46.348 --> 12:47.807
She's got nice tits.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.936
Precisely, Grasshopper,
but a little bit too nice.

13:02.572 --> 13:04.532
Okay, partner, run this number.

13:11.456 --> 13:14.041
Detective Cole's not gonna cooperate.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.045
That's the problem with new cops.

13:17.504 --> 13:20.381
They need to be taught
who to pay attention to.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.302
I'd be happy to teach him that lesson.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.225
Put some of our Russian friends on it.

13:30.517 --> 13:32.852
Let them earn their money for a change.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.733
Everything else in shape?

13:39.860 --> 13:41.069
Like clockwork.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.155
Everyone's still in the dark?

13:43.447 --> 13:47.367
It's a very tight seal, as long as
everyone keeps their mouth shut.

13:47.701 --> 13:48.743
They will.

13:50.662 --> 13:52.997
I think we've set a very good example.

14:07.888 --> 14:11.766
So, why LA? New York didn't have
enough psychopaths for you?

14:12.309 --> 14:14.269
I didn't get along with my captain.

14:14.561 --> 14:18.356
Figured it was time for a change.
The ex moved out here with the kids.

14:26.573 --> 14:28.658
Yeah. Y'all just go on...

14:33.538 --> 14:35.581
No, thank you, I don't know you that well.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.125
No, that's tea. That's good stuff.

14:37.417 --> 14:40.169
It's deer antler. It's good
for your masculinity.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.672
Ain't nothin' wrong with
my manhood, thank you.

14:42.964 --> 14:44.799
Let me just have a little sip.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.303
This is my favorite movie.

14:53.266 --> 14:56.644
Do you know I'm black?
I have no idea what you're saying.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.938
She says that movie always makes her cry.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.274
Yeah, that's a real tearjerker.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.736
Not that I cry at movies
or anything like that.

15:06.446 --> 15:09.574
It takes more than a sad scene
to break me, you know what I mean?

15:09.866 --> 15:12.326
Once in a while you should cry
'cause it cleanses the soul.

15:12.619 --> 15:14.078
You could use a little bit of that.

15:14.371 --> 15:17.332
If I need cleansing, I have
a bran muffin. Thank you.

15:17.749 --> 15:19.667
You ain't gonna find one here.

15:21.586 --> 15:22.211
Shit.

15:22.504 --> 15:24.547
I think I'm allergic to the incense.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.387
Y'all sell roaches? Damn,
I'm in the wrong business.

15:30.679 --> 15:33.765
I could make money and
never leave my apartment.

15:36.601 --> 15:38.185
Just put this underneath your tongue.

15:38.478 --> 15:41.397
It's perfect for allergies.
It'll clear you right up.

15:44.067 --> 15:45.234
This is bitter.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.903
Bitter? I don't know why it'd be bitter.

15:47.195 --> 15:48.279
What is this?

15:49.948 --> 15:52.951
It's just a little bit
of powdered deer penis.

15:56.997 --> 16:01.497
That's real funny. That's real
fuckin' funny. Damn, do I feel violated.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.889
So tell me, what's up with the beads?

16:14.181 --> 16:17.642
These here? It's called a mahla.
Tibetan prayer beads.

16:18.351 --> 16:19.268
What do you use 'em for?

16:19.561 --> 16:22.772
I use them to calm my mind
and to purify my thoughts.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.650
Yeah, I use Jack Daniel's.

16:25.942 --> 16:27.401
We're tryin' to go to the same place.

16:27.694 --> 16:29.904
We're just using a different technique.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.990
Except I don't wear the
bottle around my neck.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.742
That's because you'd
lose your job if you did.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.912
<i>Roden to 4 King 63.
Just got a call from an informant...</i>

16:38.205 --> 16:40.415
...who <i>claims to have info
on The Family Man.</i>

16:40.707 --> 16:43.000
<i>Says he'll only give it to you.
Waitin' on the south dock.</i>

16:43.293 --> 16:45.461
This is 4 King 63. We're on our way.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.016
They're breakin' into a car over there.

16:58.308 --> 17:01.102
We're here to meet an informant.
We don't have time for that.

17:01.394 --> 17:03.354
We're police. We gotta get
the bad guys once in a while.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.982
Why don't we get you
some red boots and a cape...

17:06.273 --> 17:09.443
...and you can fly around the city
and stop all the crime?

17:20.747 --> 17:21.998
Police! Freeze!

17:23.375 --> 17:26.627
You know what pisses me off? When
I see some sorry-ass motherfuckers...

17:26.920 --> 17:28.378
...like you with more hair than me.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.799
Turn around, put your
goddamn hands on the car...

17:31.091 --> 17:33.259
...before I go get my clippers
and go crazy in here.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.761
Fuck you, pig.

17:35.428 --> 17:37.513
"Fuck you?" Did he say, "Fuck you"?

17:37.806 --> 17:40.809
I'm confused. We got the badges.
We got the guns.

17:41.309 --> 17:42.852
You got a screwdriver.

17:43.186 --> 17:45.813
It's kind of like takin' a
screwdriver to a gunfight.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.982
And "pig," that's an old phrase.

17:48.275 --> 17:52.445
Y'all must not be from around here.
Y'all must be from another country...

17:53.446 --> 17:55.364
Drop the guns. Please.

17:55.699 --> 17:58.660
This is a police matter.
It's got nothin' to do with you.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.286
Drop the guns.

18:03.206 --> 18:05.875
Think we're gonna have
to do this the hard way.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.253
I can't fight, man.

18:08.587 --> 18:12.173
What do you mean you can't fight?
It's a fine time to tell me now.

18:12.465 --> 18:14.258
Get down on your knees. Now.

18:14.801 --> 18:16.928
He likes you, that's the good news.

18:17.637 --> 18:19.930
Sorry. Not without dinner and a movie.

18:26.938 --> 18:30.483
Your friend likes to do things the
hard way. Now, how about you?

18:30.775 --> 18:34.653
My friend, he's a little bit country,
I'm a little bit rock-n'-roll.

18:34.946 --> 18:36.030
What does that mean?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.867
Just an expression. What do you want?

18:39.367 --> 18:40.701
You... dead.

18:41.995 --> 18:42.787
Why?

18:43.079 --> 18:44.789
Because the pay is so good.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.585
How about if I double the pay?

18:51.504 --> 18:55.090
You have balls. But I don't think
you have enough money.

18:55.800 --> 18:56.884
Well, I do.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.095
I got thousands of dollars in my pocket.

18:59.387 --> 19:02.640
I'm gonna reach into my back
pocket slowly to get my wallet.

19:02.932 --> 19:04.516
I have a lot of cash...

19:04.809 --> 19:06.769
...or you could take plastic.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.104
"Plastic?"

19:08.605 --> 19:10.106
This is rock-n'-roll.

19:52.482 --> 19:55.109
For a minute I forgot you said you can't fight.

19:55.402 --> 19:56.486
It's not that I can't fight.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.113
I'm not supposed to.
It's against my religion.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.698
- Great.
- I'm a Buddhist.

20:00.990 --> 20:02.866
Yeah. You're a Kung Fu priest.

20:06.037 --> 20:07.413
Who sent you, man?

20:08.331 --> 20:09.790
The Russian Mafia.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.129
- Let me try.
- You speak Russian?

20:15.422 --> 20:16.506
A little bit.

20:17.716 --> 20:21.636
Answer me, goddamn it, before I beat
the shit out of you, you dumb ass!

20:23.471 --> 20:26.265
- You speak good Russian.
- Yes. Black Russian.

20:27.058 --> 20:30.311
Read him his rights even though
he's a little unconscious.

20:34.190 --> 20:35.316
He knows 'em.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.903
I'm tellin' you, Captain,
this guy is weird.

20:39.195 --> 20:40.404
Yeah, show me a cop who isn't.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.157
Look, I'm not talkin' about a
cop who wears pantyhose.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.870
This guy, he speaks Chinese,
he dresses like a monk...

20:47.537 --> 20:51.541
...and the Russians yesterday, he took
those guys out like Bruce Lee, only better.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.919
I mean, I saw him use his credit
card like a goddamn Ginsu knife.

20:55.211 --> 20:56.503
Where would you learn that?

20:56.796 --> 20:58.005
I don't know, maybe the Army.

20:58.298 --> 21:01.134
What do you want me to do,
Jim, look at his resume?

21:01.509 --> 21:05.054
Don't come to me with this kind
of shit. Just work with the guy.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.893
"Work with the guy."

22:01.319 --> 22:02.611
What does this say to you?

22:02.904 --> 22:04.822
Punishment and purification.

22:06.491 --> 22:10.203
He believes he's helping these
people by turnin' them into martyrs.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.997
Only he can't get any satisfaction.

22:13.289 --> 22:15.291
So he keeps doin' it,
gettin' bolder and bolder...

22:15.583 --> 22:17.793
...until he's either caught or killed.

22:18.253 --> 22:21.172
And he ain't gettin' his orders
from the Devil, either.

22:21.464 --> 22:23.591
He believes he's listenin'
to Jesus himself.

22:23.883 --> 22:25.634
You learn well, Grasshopper.

22:29.722 --> 22:31.181
Task force, Campbell.

22:36.437 --> 22:37.521
All right.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.401
Two more bodies.

23:08.052 --> 23:09.011
Hey, slow down.

23:09.304 --> 23:11.681
It's all right, man, we'll be back later.

23:24.819 --> 23:27.404
Hey, man, get this virgin
off the crime scene.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.933
We got Andrew Dunleavy, a psychiatrist.

23:56.225 --> 23:58.518
This is his wife Ellen.
There are two children...

23:58.811 --> 24:00.395
...but we haven't been able to locate them.

24:00.688 --> 24:02.564
Roden, squash that, man.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.610
Are you all right, Jack?

24:23.628 --> 24:25.421
- Jim, you got a minute?
- Sure.

24:25.713 --> 24:28.507
Careful, he wants to borrow money.
I know that look.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.803
- Got somethin' for you to look at.
- What is it?

24:32.512 --> 24:35.681
Found a print at the Dunleavy
scene, on the woman's body.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.809
Beautiful. It's about time.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.853
- Let's run it right away.
- Already did.

24:41.896 --> 24:43.022
It's Cole's.

24:54.909 --> 24:57.703
Your brother still works
for Intelligence, right?

24:59.664 --> 25:02.333
Tell him to find out
everything he can on Cole.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.001
Off the record.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.425
We'll extend the house-to-house
canvas by four blocks.

25:11.718 --> 25:15.346
We're lookin' for any links between
the victims. Where they shop...

25:15.638 --> 25:18.349
...get their cars repaired,
pictures developed...

25:18.641 --> 25:20.309
...anything, no matter how small.

25:20.601 --> 25:23.895
Do me a favor and get me copies of
these blood paintings on the walls...

25:24.188 --> 25:25.772
...in this stack of crime-scene photos.

25:26.065 --> 25:29.068
Send 'em out to every psych ward
and prison throughout the US.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.903
Maybe a former patient.

25:31.320 --> 25:33.405
I don't know, I just think that...

25:33.698 --> 25:36.992
...this work is so unique that any
prisoner, psychiatrist or priest...

25:37.285 --> 25:38.619
...would definitely not forget it.

25:38.911 --> 25:40.746
All right, everybody knows what to do.

25:41.039 --> 25:41.956
Let's go.

26:00.016 --> 26:01.350
No, I understand.

26:02.935 --> 26:04.937
I'll get there as fast as I can.

26:07.148 --> 26:08.023
Thanks.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.859
Hey, you're home early.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.528
What's up?

26:13.362 --> 26:17.783
I have a new patient. They don't
think she has a long time to live, so...

26:22.080 --> 26:23.498
What's wrong?

26:23.831 --> 26:25.707
There's been another killing.

26:27.668 --> 26:28.752
Same guy?

26:30.880 --> 26:31.672
Yeah.

26:31.964 --> 26:33.215
I'm sorry, Jack.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.637
He killed Ellen and her husband.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.013
He did what?

26:40.807 --> 26:44.060
I gotta go tell my kids
that their mother is dead.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.438
Jesus, Jack!

26:49.398 --> 26:51.900
I think he's makin' it personal, you know?

27:30.314 --> 27:31.898
Westlake Security.

27:33.818 --> 27:37.655
I'd like you to tell Mr. Smith that
Mr. Jones needs to contact him...

27:38.364 --> 27:39.823
...right away.

27:56.465 --> 27:58.425
I think there may be a problem.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.636
Spit it out, son.

28:03.055 --> 28:05.515
Mr. Jones, he's asking to see you.

28:06.809 --> 28:07.684
Really?

28:08.561 --> 28:10.521
I wonder what took him so long?

28:10.855 --> 28:12.731
What would you like me to do?

28:14.650 --> 28:15.984
Ignore him.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.487
He's being dealt with.

28:18.821 --> 28:21.114
And we have bigger fish to fry.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.200
Whatever you say.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.753
"Ten Ways To Spend Your Weekend."

28:52.563 --> 28:54.648
This is all we could get on Cole.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.402
Let's see.

28:59.737 --> 29:03.407
NYPD, Homicide, Task Force Command
on the DeMarco serial killings.

29:05.409 --> 29:07.411
Lots of medals, good cop.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.664
He tracked down the DeMarco killer...

29:10.957 --> 29:12.625
...shot him on a rooftop, one-on-one...

29:12.917 --> 29:15.711
...and then was busted for
actin' without sanction.

29:16.003 --> 29:17.754
Two coffees, Raffi. Extra sugar.

29:18.047 --> 29:20.299
- No coffee for me.
- They're both for me.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.134
Anything else?

29:22.969 --> 29:24.971
Nothin' in the military records.

29:25.554 --> 29:29.015
Almost nothin' before the NYPD.
Looks like this guy came out of nowhere.

29:29.308 --> 29:31.935
Are you tellin' me we don't
know nothin' about this guy?

29:32.228 --> 29:34.438
Yeah, there's one thing we know for sure.

29:34.730 --> 29:37.190
He used to be married
to the Dunleavy woman.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.319
Son of a bitch.

29:41.570 --> 29:45.615
"In my Father's house, there are
many rooms. If it were not so...

29:46.117 --> 29:49.829
"...would I have told you that I go
to prepare a place for you?

29:50.663 --> 29:54.166
"Thomas said to him, 'Lord, we do
not know where you are going.'

29:54.458 --> 29:56.835
"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way...

29:57.253 --> 30:01.507
"...and the truth and the life, no one
comes to the Father, but by me.'"

30:13.185 --> 30:15.937
Why didn't you tell anybody
it was your ex-wife?

30:16.439 --> 30:19.108
You know they would have
pulled me off the case.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.402
You should've told me.
We're workin' together.

30:21.694 --> 30:22.820
Well, I didn't.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.825
We ID'd the couple at the motel.
Eugene and Sonya Roslov.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.035
Russian, just like you said.

30:30.619 --> 30:32.162
Any connection to the others?

30:32.455 --> 30:34.457
No. They weren't even Catholic.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.293
There goes that theory. What's next?

30:40.004 --> 30:41.463
This is empty.

30:41.881 --> 30:44.008
It's everything we know about you.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.427
Your background's nothin'
but smoke and mirrors.

30:46.719 --> 30:47.428
Who are you, Jack?

30:47.720 --> 30:48.846
I can't get into it right now.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.722
Yeah, well maybe you can get into this.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.475
We found your print
at your ex-wife's house.

30:55.436 --> 30:58.230
She was my ex-wife.
I pick up my kids there all the time.

30:58.522 --> 31:00.065
The print's on the body.

31:01.692 --> 31:02.818
Planted.

31:03.110 --> 31:05.445
And there's a puff of smoke
comin' from the grassy knoll.

31:05.738 --> 31:08.240
What kind of bullshit
you tryin' to run, man?

31:09.325 --> 31:12.828
I ain't always been a cop.
That's all I can tell you right now.

31:14.580 --> 31:17.124
You are one mysterious motherfucker.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.669
Nobody seems to know
anything about your past...

31:20.961 --> 31:23.755
...and the only evidence
I got points right at you.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.258
Now, does that worry you, Jack?

31:27.676 --> 31:29.052
Do I look worried?

31:29.553 --> 31:31.471
Well, it damn sure worries me.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.038
Hello, Lento's.

31:56.705 --> 31:58.540
No, I'm sorry, we're closed.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.252
- No. It's a private lunch.
- Excuse me.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.213
There is nothing I can do.

32:05.923 --> 32:08.508
I'm telling you we're closed today.
Tomorrow we'll be open.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.677
It'll be fine. Come then.
It'll be a nice...

32:10.970 --> 32:12.304
Excuse me a minute.

32:12.596 --> 32:15.140
Asshole, what are you blind?
We're closed!

32:15.433 --> 32:17.393
You kind of talk too much!

32:19.270 --> 32:22.273
Yeah, go ahead, come on over,
we'll give you a table.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.957
You're unbelievable.
What are you doing here?

32:40.249 --> 32:43.627
You need to turn around and leave.
That's what you need to do.

32:50.468 --> 32:53.888
You don't call, you don't write.
What's worse, you don't take my calls.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.891
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir... Senator...

32:59.393 --> 33:02.729
Why don't you and I take your
little sensitive ponytail...

33:03.022 --> 33:06.150
...and your little sissy beads,
and get out of here, okay?

33:11.113 --> 33:12.531
As I was saying...

33:13.657 --> 33:17.160
Senator, as you can see, some
urgent business has just come up.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.997
Thank you, Senator, so kind.

33:24.835 --> 33:29.172
It's been such a long time, Jack.
That's the name you're using now, correct?

33:29.465 --> 33:30.549
At the moment.

33:31.675 --> 33:34.552
Can I get you a bite to eat?
The food is truly wonderful...

33:34.845 --> 33:37.430
...although the service leaves
a little to be desired.

33:37.723 --> 33:40.350
Cut the shit. I need some names,
names of consultants.

33:40.935 --> 33:44.480
Don't tell me there's a problem
you can't take care of yourself?

33:44.939 --> 33:47.691
It's about the serial killings.
I know you know about them.

33:47.983 --> 33:50.944
Yes, I do. Truly wicked. Sorry about Ellen.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.489
Wonderful woman.

33:56.242 --> 33:59.453
You know, the last two murders
were definitely the work of a pro...

33:59.745 --> 34:01.496
...not a serial killer.

34:01.789 --> 34:05.292
And I just have the feeling that
you might know who this pro is.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.087
Well, let me guess.

34:09.463 --> 34:11.214
They've discovered your checkered past...

34:11.507 --> 34:13.592
...and now they suspect you.

34:14.342 --> 34:15.677
Not exactly.

34:15.969 --> 34:19.974
They're still not totally up on
my past yet, but I know you are.

34:21.433 --> 34:24.601
Therefore, I'm sure you realize
what I'm capable of doing to you...

34:24.895 --> 34:26.187
...if I have to.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.565
Yes, indeed, I do.

34:29.858 --> 34:31.775
What kind of consultant you lookin' for?

34:32.069 --> 34:35.697
This individual gives me the
impression that he's a freelancer.

34:36.072 --> 34:38.949
Hiding his targets in the
scenario of a serial killer.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.370
Likes a. 22, likes head shots.

34:42.204 --> 34:45.706
Seems to be inflicting costume wounds
on the victims after they're dead...

34:46.000 --> 34:48.252
...and has excellent cleaning skills.

34:48.752 --> 34:51.295
I'll certainly keep my eyes
peeled, and my ears open.

34:51.589 --> 34:54.257
Right now, that's just not
gonna be good enough.

34:54.632 --> 34:57.719
Jack, you know there's a problem.
I'm kind of busy right now...

34:58.012 --> 34:59.555
...testifying before Congress.

34:59.847 --> 35:04.017
They're getting kind of cranky
about where we get our core-op funds...

35:04.602 --> 35:06.353
...but, as it's you...

35:07.938 --> 35:10.106
...I'll certainly do the best I can.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.067
For old times' sake.

35:15.112 --> 35:16.738
Good to see you, buddy.

35:18.324 --> 35:19.408
Bye, buddy.

35:25.623 --> 35:28.834
If you ever pull that shit
with me again, I'll kill you.

35:29.126 --> 35:33.130
All your little Chinese, moo-shoo pork
potions will not save you next time.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.924
You shouldn't knock Chinese potions.

35:36.216 --> 35:38.009
I have something in my pocket right now...

35:38.302 --> 35:40.971
...that'll completely clear up
that bruise on your forehead.

35:41.263 --> 35:42.097
What bruise?

35:42.389 --> 35:43.431
That bruise.

36:46.787 --> 36:48.413
Do you validate parking?

36:56.004 --> 36:57.213
Hello, Lento's.

36:57.923 --> 37:02.177
No, no, no, that won't work.
We're closed for renovation. I'd say...

37:04.263 --> 37:06.431
...two months. Yeah. Thanks.

37:10.811 --> 37:12.354
You're chasing your tail with this one.

37:12.646 --> 37:16.691
He probably bought it at a flea market.
No way we're gonna find him there.

37:17.401 --> 37:21.405
We're gonna have to go back to basics.
You guys gotta do your canvassing.

37:22.322 --> 37:25.074
- Your phone is ringing.
- You're not listening to me.

37:25.367 --> 37:27.369
Read my lips... talk to the people!

37:30.247 --> 37:32.874
<i>Detective, my name is Melanie Sardes.</i>

37:34.042 --> 37:36.711
<i>I think I know who you're looking for.</i>

37:39.131 --> 37:43.009
I'm sorry I didn't call you guys sooner,
Detective, but I don't open...

37:43.302 --> 37:47.389
...my mail every day. There's so much,
it kind of gets away from me.

37:48.640 --> 37:51.934
I used to teach art two
days a week up at the prison.

37:55.272 --> 37:56.481
Do you have a cold?

37:56.774 --> 37:58.358
No, I'm allergic to the incense.

37:58.650 --> 38:00.109
Can I get you something?

38:00.402 --> 38:04.155
No, thanks. I'm gonna go suck
on some deer penis. I'll be all right.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.492
It's a Chinese deer penis.

38:08.118 --> 38:09.744
You put it under your...

38:10.496 --> 38:11.914
You were saying?

38:13.624 --> 38:16.418
Well, I knew the drawings
you sent were familiar.

38:17.211 --> 38:19.004
Especially the halos.

38:19.713 --> 38:21.506
Then when I saw the titian crucifixion...

38:21.799 --> 38:23.133
...it just clicked.

38:24.301 --> 38:26.011
He was my favorite student.

38:26.386 --> 38:28.429
See, my whole approach is organic.

38:28.722 --> 38:29.973
I start on the inside influence...

38:30.265 --> 38:33.518
...and then I try to draw
on the student's inner life.

38:33.852 --> 38:37.564
It's about having them find
the moment. A moment without...

38:38.816 --> 38:40.818
I've got to hurry back to the nineties now.

38:41.109 --> 38:43.027
Could you just give me his name?

38:44.154 --> 38:45.613
Christopher Maynard.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.284
- We're moving fast on this.
- I know.

38:49.576 --> 38:50.868
Where's our warrant?

38:51.161 --> 38:52.996
Wait, give me a minute.

38:55.999 --> 38:57.583
What's goin' on?

38:58.335 --> 38:59.794
- You didn't hear?
- No, I didn't.

39:00.087 --> 39:01.671
We got a make on the killer.
Name and address.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.548
We're just waitin' for the warrants.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.217
Thank you so much for tellin' me.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.511
Well, I figured Campbell told you.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.182
Yes, get me Research.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.852
Would you do me a favor
and check if there's...

39:15.143 --> 39:19.397
...a Catholic Church within a nine-block
radius of 929 Barrow Street?

40:28.133 --> 40:30.260
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

40:43.774 --> 40:46.234
I had this feeling I was gonna die today!

40:47.486 --> 40:48.695
Christopher.

40:49.863 --> 40:53.074
This isn't gonna work, buddy.
Here in a church...

40:53.992 --> 40:55.410
...with the priest?

40:55.953 --> 40:58.038
I don't want to be hurting people.

40:58.622 --> 40:59.914
I don't like to.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.251
Could I please speak with the priest?

41:06.463 --> 41:10.341
Could I have your permission to
please speak with the Father a minute?

41:10.842 --> 41:12.844
I know you don't want to hurt him.

41:13.136 --> 41:14.053
Father...

41:15.389 --> 41:16.890
...come here, please.

41:17.641 --> 41:18.725
Right away.

41:28.193 --> 41:29.485
Get out of here.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.286
Are they searching for me?

41:38.578 --> 41:39.912
Yes, sir, they are.

41:40.372 --> 41:42.248
How did you know I'd be here?

41:43.208 --> 41:47.587
Well, I just took a lucky guess.
It's the closest church to your home.

41:48.547 --> 41:51.007
You're the new cop they brought in, right?

41:51.299 --> 41:53.467
Yes, sir, I am. How'd you know?

41:53.969 --> 41:56.805
I keep track of these things.
It's part of my job.

42:01.226 --> 42:02.393
So, you know...

42:03.687 --> 42:05.939
...you killed my ex-wife, don't you?

42:10.902 --> 42:13.154
I want you to know I didn't hurt her.

42:13.822 --> 42:14.614
You didn't?

42:14.906 --> 42:17.950
I only kill who I was told to kill,
Who I had to kill.

42:18.368 --> 42:19.744
The Roslovs?

42:20.495 --> 42:21.662
The Dunleavys?

42:21.955 --> 42:23.331
Did you kill them?

42:23.832 --> 42:25.208
I was spared them.

42:25.959 --> 42:27.543
Someone else was called.

42:27.836 --> 42:29.921
Who was given the call, Christopher?

42:31.757 --> 42:33.675
There's too much pain here.
I gotta go now.

42:33.967 --> 42:34.842
Listen to me.

42:35.135 --> 42:35.969
You, stay!

42:36.261 --> 42:37.345
Listen to me.

42:38.805 --> 42:41.474
Bless me, Father, for I have
sinned. My last confession...

42:41.767 --> 42:44.436
...was six months ago.
- Christopher, please...

42:45.437 --> 42:46.563
Then you help me.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.648
- You help me.
- I can't do that.

42:48.940 --> 42:51.067
I am in hell! I am in hell!

42:51.902 --> 42:53.570
Listen to me. Listen to me.

42:53.862 --> 42:56.823
Do it now or I will kill you!
You believe it?

42:58.366 --> 43:00.409
- One... two...
- This is God's house.

43:00.702 --> 43:02.537
- Don't make me do this.
- Please.

43:02.829 --> 43:04.247
- Don't!
- Three!

43:26.311 --> 43:28.646
This is Maynard's gun. Book it for me.

43:31.608 --> 43:34.110
This is bad, Jack. This is real bad, man.

43:34.402 --> 43:36.237
I can't win for losin', man.

43:37.989 --> 43:40.700
I tried so hard not to let this happen.

43:41.243 --> 43:45.288
We tossed his house, we found all
kinds of shit: barbed wire, spikes...

43:45.580 --> 43:47.748
- He was definitely our guy.
- Shit.

43:51.169 --> 43:53.004
What the fuck are you doin' here?

43:53.296 --> 43:56.048
Well, I just thought
that he wouldn't be home...

43:56.341 --> 43:58.384
...maybe I'd find him at the church.

43:58.677 --> 43:59.844
So, you came to blow him away?

44:00.137 --> 44:03.473
No sir, he drew on me, tried
to kill me. I had no choice.

44:04.432 --> 44:08.519
No choice? The priest told me
you let him go. Said he was calm.

44:10.355 --> 44:12.273
We'll never know, will we?

44:12.983 --> 44:15.110
It's just like DeMarco in New York.

44:15.527 --> 44:18.363
You come out alone... the suspect is dead.

44:18.864 --> 44:20.782
Captain, we had a positive ID on...

44:21.074 --> 44:22.325
Shut the fuck up!

44:22.868 --> 44:25.328
I don't want freelance
cops working for me!

44:25.620 --> 44:27.496
I want you... and you...

44:28.665 --> 44:30.541
...Internal Affairs, tomorrow morning.

44:30.834 --> 44:31.918
Don't be late.

44:44.097 --> 44:46.557
Not so fast. We're sendin' for the poly.

44:51.730 --> 44:53.356
So, what'd you tell him?

44:53.982 --> 44:57.735
Everything. The prints, the
bullshit past, the whole nine.

44:59.112 --> 45:01.280
You didn't leave me any choice, Jack.

45:01.573 --> 45:03.908
Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

45:06.161 --> 45:08.288
I'll start by asking you
a few test questions...

45:08.580 --> 45:12.333
...just to establish a base line.
Please answer yes to both questions.

45:12.626 --> 45:14.669
- Are you Detective Jack Cole?
- Yes.

45:15.795 --> 45:18.214
- Have you ever climbed Mt. Everest?
- Yes.

45:24.304 --> 45:25.722
Okay. Let's begin.

45:28.642 --> 45:30.769
You've been a police
officer for seven years?

45:31.061 --> 45:31.895
Yes.

45:32.187 --> 45:34.689
Do you know how your fingerprints
came to be at the crime scene?

45:34.981 --> 45:35.815
No.

45:36.107 --> 45:38.234
Are you withholding information
pertinent to this investigation?

45:38.526 --> 45:39.360
No.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.529
Did you shoot Christopher Maynard?

45:41.821 --> 45:42.696
Yes.

45:43.365 --> 45:45.241
- Was it in self-defense?
- Yes.

45:45.533 --> 45:47.368
Did you kill your ex-wife?

45:48.370 --> 45:49.329
No.

45:49.621 --> 45:51.205
- Have you ever killed anyone?
- Yes.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.667
Have you ever killed anyone
outside of police duty?

45:54.960 --> 45:57.837
I don't think that's pertinent
to this investigation.

45:58.129 --> 45:59.380
It's a yes or no answer.

45:59.673 --> 46:00.548
Is it?

46:01.967 --> 46:03.343
There's my answer.

46:04.719 --> 46:07.138
Don't do yourself any favors, Jack.

46:11.059 --> 46:14.312
I've never seen anything like this.
Everything reads true.

46:18.108 --> 46:19.609
Can someone learn to beat this thing?

46:19.901 --> 46:23.696
It's possible, but you'd have to have
total control over your emotions.

46:23.989 --> 46:26.950
I don't know anybody
who could pull that off.

46:27.993 --> 46:29.953
What do you want me to do, Jack?

46:30.245 --> 46:32.580
The prints' thing is bad enough,
but jerkin' the poly off...

46:32.872 --> 46:35.666
...just leaves us with our dicks
in the air for all your fans.

46:35.959 --> 46:38.920
You gotta tell me which fans
you're talkin' about. I have so many.

46:39.212 --> 46:40.880
I'm talkin' about Frank Deverell.

46:41.172 --> 46:42.715
He's talkin' to people about you.

46:43.008 --> 46:43.758
Like who?

46:44.050 --> 46:45.051
Like the DA.

46:45.343 --> 46:47.011
You never should've been
on the scene with his kid.

46:47.304 --> 46:49.055
About how you put him through a window.

46:49.347 --> 46:51.390
I wonder if that's
the same Frank Deverell...

46:51.683 --> 46:53.017
...that came and thanked me...

46:53.310 --> 46:55.395
...for not shooting his son
in the goddamn head.

46:55.687 --> 46:57.021
Yeah, things change.

46:57.605 --> 46:59.481
Internal Affairs is lookin' at you, Jack...

46:59.774 --> 47:02.067
...which means they're lookin' at me, too.

47:02.360 --> 47:05.321
I'm gonna suspend you
until we can sort this shit out.

47:06.614 --> 47:10.034
You know, I somehow think
that you know I'm gettin' screwed.

47:10.493 --> 47:12.828
Yeah, well, tell it to the worry beads.

47:13.288 --> 47:15.456
No one's takin' any chances with you, Jack.

47:15.749 --> 47:19.252
You're officially a suspect in the murder
of your ex-wife and her husband.

47:19.544 --> 47:22.630
Give me your ID, your badge and
make sure we know where you are...

47:22.922 --> 47:24.798
...'cause IA is comin' for you.

47:28.928 --> 47:31.347
Which one of these did you just piss in?

47:37.854 --> 47:38.771
Son of a bitch.

47:51.159 --> 47:52.994
Capt., you wanted to see me?

47:53.703 --> 47:57.123
Christopher Maynard was with his church
group in New York for two weeks.

47:57.415 --> 47:58.833
Keep me posted.

48:00.210 --> 48:04.297
Accounted for every minute. There's
no way he could've done the last two.

48:05.757 --> 48:06.591
Cole?

48:06.925 --> 48:10.386
You tell me. He was havin' a
custody battle with his ex-wife.

48:10.970 --> 48:14.181
She didn't want him spendin'
too much time with the kids.

48:14.682 --> 48:16.517
Listen. When he was in New York...

48:16.810 --> 48:20.230
...the DeMarco killings started two
months after he got assigned to Homicide.

48:20.522 --> 48:21.814
He moved here eight months ago.

48:22.107 --> 48:25.860
Exactly two months after that
The Family Man killings start.

48:27.612 --> 48:29.530
Maybe we should see what he has to say.

48:29.823 --> 48:31.658
What, are you goin' soft on me, Jim?

48:31.950 --> 48:33.868
Guy's a weirdo, you said so yourself.

48:34.160 --> 48:38.414
Just let Internal Affairs handle it.
They're puttin' a case together right now.

48:42.794 --> 48:45.296
Stay away from him. He's bad news.

51:39.887 --> 51:41.763
I take it something is amiss.

51:43.725 --> 51:44.851
What was he doing there?

51:45.143 --> 51:47.186
Didn't look like he was
after anything specific.

51:47.478 --> 51:49.313
Nothing to worry about.

51:50.690 --> 51:54.735
Got halfway through the place. Nothing
there to connect you to the Roslov woman.

51:55.028 --> 51:56.988
I hope not, for your sake.

51:57.905 --> 51:59.990
You should've gone through
that house days ago.

52:00.283 --> 52:02.451
I'm not supposed to be doing cleanup.

52:13.254 --> 52:14.588
Where is she? Have you seen her?

52:14.881 --> 52:17.425
No, I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

52:17.717 --> 52:19.969
But this note came just after you left.

52:26.893 --> 52:28.853
"I cannot go with you..."

52:29.729 --> 52:31.480
or ever see you again."

52:33.316 --> 52:36.777
- "I love you... my darling."
- That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

52:37.278 --> 52:38.862
"God bless you."

52:42.450 --> 52:44.326
- What's happenin'?
- What's up?

52:45.286 --> 52:47.830
- What the hell you doin' here?
- Gotta talk.

52:48.998 --> 52:51.542
- Those aren't tears, are they?
- No, man.

52:54.337 --> 52:56.422
My eyes leak sometimes
when I yawn, that's all.

52:56.714 --> 52:57.965
- They leak?
- Yeah.

52:58.966 --> 53:00.634
- They leak.
- What do you want?

53:00.927 --> 53:03.137
- Let me just...
- Wait... I'm fine.

53:03.513 --> 53:04.847
What do you want?

53:05.431 --> 53:07.891
- I gotta talk to you.
- All right, come on.

53:10.019 --> 53:12.479
What if there's a serial
killer out there...

53:12.772 --> 53:16.275
...he's killin' families, we
nickname him "The Family Man."

53:16.943 --> 53:19.236
But there's somebody else out there...

53:20.238 --> 53:21.864
...who has somethin' more sinister goin' on.

53:22.156 --> 53:24.324
He has to terminate some targets.

53:24.617 --> 53:27.995
So, he kills his targets and their
entire families to make himself...

53:28.287 --> 53:30.080
...look like The Family Man.

53:30.373 --> 53:32.249
While we're lookin' for a serial killer.

53:32.542 --> 53:35.586
When, in fact, there's two of 'em
and one of 'em is a pro.

53:35.878 --> 53:39.256
- How do you know it's a pro?
- 'Cause I know the work of a pro.

53:40.133 --> 53:42.385
I found this in Sonya Roslov's house.

53:42.802 --> 53:44.428
It's a round trip to Moscow...

53:44.721 --> 53:46.597
...bought and paid for
by Deverell Industries.

53:46.889 --> 53:49.016
You think Frank Deverell
had somethin' to do with this?

53:49.308 --> 53:50.267
I do, sir.

53:52.061 --> 53:54.313
Sonya Roslov, she was a translator.

53:54.605 --> 53:56.440
If Deverell did any business in Russia...

53:56.733 --> 53:58.609
...it makes sense he'd hire someone like that.

53:58.901 --> 54:01.528
- What if she was a mule?
- Smuggling what?

54:02.155 --> 54:04.407
Chemical weapons of some kind.

54:06.242 --> 54:07.660
Now that the Wall fell...

54:07.952 --> 54:10.120
...there's a ton of that
stuff floatin' around.

54:10.413 --> 54:12.832
That would explain the cancer in her body.

54:13.124 --> 54:15.918
If you look at who controls
that stuff on the black market...

54:16.210 --> 54:17.294
...it's the Russian Mafia.

54:17.587 --> 54:19.964
- As in the guys who jumped us.
- You got it.

54:20.256 --> 54:22.675
So, what connects the Dunleavy's to Deverell?

54:22.967 --> 54:25.719
I don't know yet, but I
know we could find out.

54:26.512 --> 54:29.932
You know, they will take my badge
if they find out I'm workin' with you.

54:30.224 --> 54:32.935
But, my gut tells me you might be right.

54:34.771 --> 54:36.898
- I always go with my gut.
- Ok.

54:40.026 --> 54:43.571
I don't know about you, but I'm
gonna go see the rest of this movie.

54:43.863 --> 54:45.197
Is it a good movie?

54:46.908 --> 54:48.409
You've never seen <i>Casablanca</i> ?

54:48.701 --> 54:51.662
You're asking me
if I've ever seen <i>Casablanca</i> ?

54:52.371 --> 54:53.080
Have you?

54:53.372 --> 54:55.916
You gotta be kidding. Me?
Never seen <i>Casablanca</i> ?

54:56.209 --> 54:57.460
Have you ever seen <i>Casablanca</i> ?

54:57.752 --> 54:58.419
No.

54:59.295 --> 55:00.504
Come on.

55:02.423 --> 55:06.677
And of course, Donald survived
with everything but his pride intact.

55:07.887 --> 55:10.598
I never expected Cole to get this close.

55:11.599 --> 55:14.810
I thought you kept better track
of your ex-employees.

55:16.437 --> 55:19.231
No way to anticipate
he'd become this involved.

55:19.899 --> 55:22.526
Who is he? Obviously not just a cop.

55:23.778 --> 55:27.072
He was a brilliant soldier.
West Point, that kind of thing.

55:27.907 --> 55:32.077
I found him in Vietnam.
Recruited him for a special projects unit.

55:33.454 --> 55:35.330
The Program, we called it.

55:35.623 --> 55:38.125
He handled a lot of odd jobs for us.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.878
- Such as?
- Now, Mr. Deverell...

55:41.254 --> 55:43.881
...don't ask about things
you don't really want to know.

55:44.173 --> 55:46.800
Suffice to say, to the people he hunted for us...

55:47.093 --> 55:49.595
...he was known as "The Glimmer Man. "

55:50.930 --> 55:52.973
There'd be nothing but jungle...

55:53.975 --> 55:55.476
...then a glimmer...

55:57.520 --> 55:59.063
...then you'd be dead.

55:59.772 --> 56:01.940
Why isn't he still with you?

56:02.275 --> 56:06.028
He was booted out of the
program in '84. Went native on us.

56:08.030 --> 56:09.865
Made up his own assignments.

56:10.157 --> 56:12.033
Disappeared... for months.

56:12.493 --> 56:14.411
Ended up in Thailand...

56:15.371 --> 56:17.831
...chanting in some temple or other.

56:18.666 --> 56:21.210
They say he was saved by a holy man.

56:22.795 --> 56:26.924
So many stories about this fella,
I don't know which ones are true anymore.

56:33.097 --> 56:35.224
- What do we do about him?
- Broom him.

56:36.142 --> 56:38.978
Time to lose everybody
who knows anythin'.

56:41.272 --> 56:43.065
And I mean everybody.

56:45.067 --> 56:46.485
Johnny's no threat.

56:47.904 --> 56:51.282
I beg to differ. He's
already spilled to the shrink.

56:53.117 --> 56:56.036
The poor boy knows too much.
Simple as that.

56:57.538 --> 56:59.039
Johnny'll do what I say.

56:59.332 --> 57:01.417
Let me put this another way.

57:01.918 --> 57:04.629
I have four loose links in this operation:

57:05.004 --> 57:07.089
Two cops, you, and the boy.

57:08.215 --> 57:09.841
Three of you have to go.

57:10.176 --> 57:11.927
You can choose which three.

57:15.222 --> 57:17.390
You'll have to do it yourself.

57:18.017 --> 57:19.435
Frank, I'll take care of Johnny.

57:19.727 --> 57:22.146
Who's gonna take care
of Cole and Campbell?

57:22.438 --> 57:24.606
I'll put Donald on the others right away.

57:24.899 --> 57:26.317
That's the spirit.

57:26.609 --> 57:29.069
Now, come on in. The water's fine.

59:53.798 --> 59:54.715
Shit!

01:00:45.099 --> 01:00:47.017
Take the kids upstairs.

01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.275
- John Cole?
- Yes.

01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:57.861
Miller and Russo from Internal Affairs.

01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:00.156
We have a warrant for your arrest.

01:01:00.656 --> 01:01:03.283
Do you want to take a minute
to gather a few things?

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:06.245
No, that's perfectly all right.
I'm ready to go.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:02:00.173
Coldest winter I can remember in LA.

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.426
Wettest, too.

01:04:04.089 --> 01:04:05.548
They got you, too.

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:08.301
No, I bought all this shit after the riots.

01:04:08.594 --> 01:04:10.929
It means we're close, man, we're close.

01:04:11.221 --> 01:04:12.847
Do I look like I give a shit?

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:17.185
You better give a shit, 'cause they ain't
gonna stop till they get us both.

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.525
Does this say, "deer antler"?

01:04:24.693 --> 01:04:26.111
Give me that.

01:04:27.279 --> 01:04:30.490
- It was a free sample.
- There's a whole case over here.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:32.618
Just stay out of my shit.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:36.830
Can I just take this moment to
tell you how moved I am deeply?

01:04:37.122 --> 01:04:39.165
Yeah, well, that makes one of us.

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.544
I found somethin' on your
ex-wife's phone records.

01:04:42.836 --> 01:04:44.963
Someone called the house
the night she was killed.

01:04:45.255 --> 01:04:49.425
They called six times, only talked
about 10 or 15 seconds each time.

01:04:50.094 --> 01:04:52.012
You got a number or somethin'?

01:04:52.846 --> 01:04:56.558
Could I take those CDs?
They look like I could still use them.

01:04:57.601 --> 01:04:58.977
Got it. Come on.

01:04:59.269 --> 01:05:02.188
Could I ask you somethin'?
Did you actually live in this shitbox?

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:03.940
Man, will you come on?

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.297
Now, what if this is really our guy?

01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:29.465
- We'll reason with him.
- Right.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:34.596
- What?
- Police!

01:05:37.683 --> 01:05:39.184
I'm Detective Cole,
this is Detective Campbell...

01:05:39.476 --> 01:05:41.853
...with the Los Angeles Police Department.

01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:44.273
We'd like to ask you some
questions about some calls...

01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:46.817
...you may have made to a Dr. Dunleavy.

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:52.865
You look like you just came from a riot.

01:05:53.198 --> 01:05:53.865
Thanks.

01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:56.451
He looks like he just came from a riot.

01:05:56.952 --> 01:06:00.413
Yeah, this number's billed to me,
but it's my daughter's phone.

01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:05.919
I know you, don't I?

01:06:07.004 --> 01:06:10.215
Yeah, you know me. You put
my boyfriend through a window.

01:06:12.259 --> 01:06:14.886
High school, window. I remember now.

01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:18.098
You're Johnny Deverell's
girlfriend, aren't you?

01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.932
So?

01:06:19.224 --> 01:06:23.144
So, I was just wondering, how long
have you known Dr. Dunleavy?

01:06:24.521 --> 01:06:26.564
I don't know any Dunleavy.

01:06:27.399 --> 01:06:30.110
You called him the night he was killed.

01:06:30.903 --> 01:06:33.697
Yeah. Well, it wasn't me.
I don't need a shrink.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.658
We never said he was a shrink.

01:06:39.912 --> 01:06:42.623
Okay, I knew him but I didn't call him.

01:06:43.582 --> 01:06:44.916
I wonder who did?

01:06:46.543 --> 01:06:47.627
Johnny did.

01:06:48.295 --> 01:06:51.172
When he got busted with the coke,
they made him see a shrink.

01:06:51.465 --> 01:06:53.341
The shrink was Dunleavy, right?

01:06:53.759 --> 01:06:54.676
Millie.

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:58.555
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart, the games are over.

01:06:58.847 --> 01:07:01.182
I want you to tell me right now...

01:07:01.683 --> 01:07:04.644
...why Johnny was making
phone calls from this room.

01:07:05.145 --> 01:07:06.855
He was afraid to call from home.

01:07:07.147 --> 01:07:08.022
Why?

01:07:08.315 --> 01:07:11.860
His stepfather. Johnny knew
some bad things he was doing.

01:07:12.277 --> 01:07:15.154
Would you happen to know
where we could find this boy?

01:07:15.447 --> 01:07:18.616
His stepfather put him away
at Our Lady Of Angels.

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:23.747
You don't think Deverell would
kill his own stepson, do you?

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:28.210
Right. Dumb question.
Let's get out of here.

01:08:25.892 --> 01:08:28.394
- You all right, Johnny?
- Yeah, never been better.

01:08:28.687 --> 01:08:31.231
Yeah, we need to ask some
questions about your stepdad.

01:08:31.523 --> 01:08:32.732
He's a prick.

01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:35.359
Yeah, besides that.

01:08:36.903 --> 01:08:38.779
Did your dad kill Dunleavy?

01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:43.201
Yeah, I tried to call him,
I tried to warn him, I swear to God.

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:45.495
We know, we know. It's all right.

01:08:47.038 --> 01:08:49.499
All right, everybody just relax. Police.

01:08:49.916 --> 01:08:51.125
Why'd he do it?

01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:54.254
Okay, he had Donald kill his translator...

01:08:55.714 --> 01:09:00.093
...because she knew that my father was
smugglin' in some bad shit from Russia.

01:09:01.053 --> 01:09:02.888
And I found out about it.

01:09:03.263 --> 01:09:06.683
So, he got all freaked out,
and thought I told Dr. Dunleavy.

01:09:07.267 --> 01:09:09.852
So he had Donald kill him and his wife...

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.438
...and made it look
like the serial killer did it.

01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:13.939
Who was helpin' him?

01:09:14.232 --> 01:09:15.649
Some little guy.

01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:18.528
Southern accent...

01:09:19.779 --> 01:09:21.615
- Smith.
- Yeah, the government guy.

01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:23.198
Who's Smith?

01:09:23.658 --> 01:09:25.577
You're about to find out.

01:09:25.868 --> 01:09:27.745
Sister, take this boy
and keep an eye on him.

01:09:28.037 --> 01:09:30.122
Don't let anything happen to him.
Don't leave him alone.

01:09:30.415 --> 01:09:33.334
Yes, of course. I'll take care
of you, Johnny. Come.

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:41.760
See you later, Joe.

01:10:06.952 --> 01:10:08.119
How you doin'?

01:10:10.455 --> 01:10:12.623
Jack, what a pleasant surprise...

01:10:17.754 --> 01:10:20.465
You know, in most states in this country...

01:10:20.757 --> 01:10:24.302
...kidnapping is still a no-no.
Hell, we don't even do it anymore.

01:10:24.594 --> 01:10:26.929
Do me a favor. Spare me the drama and...

01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:29.807
...tell me a story.
What's Deverell smuggling?

01:10:30.851 --> 01:10:32.686
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:33.770
Really?

01:10:36.022 --> 01:10:38.441
Goddamn, Jack! What are you doin', man?

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:43.822
Deverell's killed four people to hide
something, and I want to find out what.

01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:46.116
You're a fuckin' psycho.

01:10:47.325 --> 01:10:49.618
I don't know what the hell
he's talkin' about.

01:10:49.911 --> 01:10:50.995
Well, you're a cop!

01:10:51.288 --> 01:10:52.747
Aren't you gonna help?

01:10:53.498 --> 01:10:54.582
Okay.

01:10:55.208 --> 01:10:57.251
But I'm a really bad shot.

01:10:57.544 --> 01:11:00.004
- Stay out of it.
- I'm just tryin' to help.

01:11:00.922 --> 01:11:03.007
Kill me if you like, you son of a bitch.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.885
I still have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

01:11:07.512 --> 01:11:10.598
Jack, I know we've had
some harsh words in the past...

01:11:19.399 --> 01:11:21.943
- I tell you I do not know...
- Okay...

01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:30.535
I need that hand. Jack, I need that hand.

01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:33.455
You know I will. Right about...

01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:36.124
All right! Time! Game over!

01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:52.682
God I miss you, Jack.

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:57.854
So many young men today
just won't go that extra mile.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:01.774
I miss you too, Smith. Now, what is it?

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.027
Deverell is smugglin'...

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:05.945
...chemical weapons in from Russia.

01:12:06.238 --> 01:12:10.408
I made the contacts for him. The deal's
being brokered by the Russian Mafia.

01:12:11.952 --> 01:12:15.163
Would one of you gentlemen
mind callin' me an ambulance?

01:12:15.455 --> 01:12:17.457
So, what's he doin' with this stuff?

01:12:17.749 --> 01:12:21.043
Deal's bein' done tomorrow.
Some welfare hotel downtown.

01:12:21.461 --> 01:12:24.172
He's sellin' it to a bunch
of Serbian freedom fighters.

01:12:24.464 --> 01:12:25.840
You mean terrorists.

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:28.426
Semantics. You say tomato...

01:12:29.135 --> 01:12:32.096
No, motherfucker, I didn't say,
"tomato." I said, "terrorists."

01:12:32.389 --> 01:12:33.390
You work for the government.

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:36.142
Why would you, of all people, help Deverell?

01:12:38.645 --> 01:12:41.481
To get rich, son. To get rich, why else?

01:12:42.148 --> 01:12:43.357
You got that?

01:12:44.109 --> 01:12:45.735
Yeah, I got that.

01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:51.449
Well, aren't you the grown-up spy?

01:12:53.785 --> 01:12:55.369
What do you want?

01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:59.457
I want you and your friends to
leave me alone. Forget that I exist.

01:12:59.749 --> 01:13:00.708
I already have.

01:13:01.001 --> 01:13:02.335
Don't make me come back and kill you.

01:13:02.627 --> 01:13:03.794
- I won't.
- Good.

01:13:10.343 --> 01:13:13.596
Gentlemen, we must not
forget the little matter...

01:13:14.848 --> 01:13:17.350
...of the ambulance.
- I only shot you in one foot.

01:13:17.642 --> 01:13:19.352
Hobble to a hospital.

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:35.994
<i>Well, safe to assume, folks, that
the rainiest winter in memory is over.</i>

01:13:36.286 --> 01:13:40.581
<i>Sunny and dry weather for tomorrow
and for the entire five-day period.</i>

01:13:40.874 --> 01:13:44.252
Everything we could hope for
in this part of the country...

01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:48.423
<i>Deverell is smugglin' chemical
weapons in from Russia.</i>

01:13:49.215 --> 01:13:51.675
<i>The deal's bein' brokered
by the Russian Mafia.</i>

01:13:51.968 --> 01:13:53.928
- Who is this?
- So, how's that, asshole?

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:57.181
I know you're friends with everyone
from the postman to the President...

01:13:57.474 --> 01:13:59.726
...but no one will touch you
with a ten-foot pole...

01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:01.477
...when this shit gets out. Understand?

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.188
Detective Cole.

01:14:03.897 --> 01:14:06.441
You are persistent, I'll give you that.

01:14:06.733 --> 01:14:09.569
Looks like I got somethin' you
want, you got somethin' I want.

01:14:09.861 --> 01:14:11.946
- What might that be?
- Donald.

01:14:12.405 --> 01:14:14.365
Donald's your triggerman, isn't he?

01:14:14.658 --> 01:14:15.408
I'm listening.

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:17.326
<i>I want him, not you.</i>

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:20.246
<i>Deliver him to me with a nice
bow and the murder weapon.</i>

01:14:20.538 --> 01:14:22.039
<i>I'll take it from there.</i>

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:26.252
You take the tape... my name
gets clean... your name stays clean.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.713
<i>Everybody's happy, how's that?</i>

01:14:29.005 --> 01:14:30.006
Done.

01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:32.842
Why don't you meet me tomorrow?

01:14:33.134 --> 01:14:36.512
I'm doing a little business at a place
called the Ovington Arms, downtown.

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:39.641
Apartment D-14.
Would 10:00 be good for you?

01:14:46.606 --> 01:14:48.399
Why does this gotta be so complicated?

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:50.610
This isn't complicated.
It's nothing but a game.

01:14:50.902 --> 01:14:52.737
Reminds me of an old Persian tactician...

01:14:53.029 --> 01:14:55.823
...trying to teach his
young troops strategy.

01:14:56.157 --> 01:14:58.200
That, later on, came to be known as chess.

01:14:58.493 --> 01:15:00.077
So, we're gonna bore 'em to death now?

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:03.289
Young warriors used to like
to fight head-on.

01:15:03.748 --> 01:15:05.916
Old warriors like to wait...

01:15:06.459 --> 01:15:10.379
...let their opponents expose the board,
work themselves into a corner...

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:13.007
Time to go. Sun Tzu, The Art of War.

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:16.344
Sun Tzu. Just keeps gettin' stranger.

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:22.975
<i>Donald's your triggerman, isn't he?</i>

01:15:23.268 --> 01:15:23.977
<i>I'm listening.</i>

01:15:24.269 --> 01:15:25.728
<i>I want him, not you.</i>

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:28.732
<i>Deliver him to me with a nice bow
and the murder weapon.</i>

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:30.233
<i>I'll take it from there.</i>

01:15:30.525 --> 01:15:33.069
<i>Take the tape... my name gets clean...</i>

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:37.240
<i>...your name stays clean.
Everybody's happy, how's that?</i>

01:15:38.116 --> 01:15:38.950
<i>Done.</i>

01:15:40.952 --> 01:15:43.996
Guess your ass just got sold
down the river, shithead.

01:16:13.401 --> 01:16:15.653
This won't take long. Just a quick pick up.

01:16:15.945 --> 01:16:17.237
I'm sure it won't.

01:17:24.681 --> 01:17:26.015
Shabby, but chic.

01:17:35.692 --> 01:17:37.568
Either we're a little early...

01:17:37.861 --> 01:17:39.904
...or our hosts are a little late.

01:17:47.704 --> 01:17:49.789
What the hell is going on, Donald?

01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:51.916
You tell me.

01:17:54.502 --> 01:17:58.672
You think you're gonna hand me
over to Cole. Bad move, fruitcake.

01:18:00.091 --> 01:18:02.426
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:07.807
You'll never get out of here.

01:18:08.099 --> 01:18:10.017
No, this is my show from now on.

01:18:17.942 --> 01:18:19.944
Positively Shakespearean.

01:18:21.279 --> 01:18:22.238
"To be..."

01:18:23.114 --> 01:18:23.781
"...or not to be!"

01:18:24.282 --> 01:18:25.074
Time to go.

01:18:25.366 --> 01:18:28.035
Wait. We don't know how
many guys are in there.

01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:31.414
What do you want me to do?
Wait till they all kill each other?

01:18:31.706 --> 01:18:33.374
If the old warriors are patient and...

01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:35.751
...all the young warriors,
they kill each other and...

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:37.253
...that's how we get to be old.

01:18:37.545 --> 01:18:39.046
I like that plan too. You listened well.

01:18:39.339 --> 01:18:40.882
That's what I told you in the bar.

01:18:41.174 --> 01:18:43.342
I don't know why I don't
listen to myself. I'm stupid.

01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:44.844
Let's just wait.

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.680
Drop the guns! Police!

01:18:49.349 --> 01:18:50.099
Put your guns down!

01:18:50.391 --> 01:18:51.475
Drop that fuckin' gun!

01:18:51.768 --> 01:18:52.685
Drop the gun now!

01:18:52.977 --> 01:18:54.269
Drop the gun, boy.

01:20:23.651 --> 01:20:24.568
Freeze!

01:20:28.781 --> 01:20:30.157
Just drop it!

01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:31.701
You, too!

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:33.452
Where do you live?

01:20:33.745 --> 01:20:36.789
- Around the corner.
- Well, get your ass around the corner!

01:20:37.081 --> 01:20:39.458
And take little <i>Whoopi Goldberg</i> with you.

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:41.502
Jesus Christ.

01:20:42.086 --> 01:20:43.796
Showdown on <i>Sesame Street</i>.

01:20:44.589 --> 01:20:47.383
<i>Big Bird</i> will pop out of
one of these doors next.

01:21:38.976 --> 01:21:39.726
Hi!

01:21:51.489 --> 01:21:52.490
Out here!

01:21:55.493 --> 01:21:58.329
Hurry, man! I can't hold on much longer!

01:22:00.998 --> 01:22:03.458
Oh, God, don't look down.
Don't look down.

01:22:05.169 --> 01:22:06.545
Oh, don't look up.

01:22:18.516 --> 01:22:20.017
All right, hang on.

01:22:20.309 --> 01:22:22.060
Yeah. That's a good idea, man.

01:22:22.353 --> 01:22:24.271
I wouldn't have thought of that.

01:22:27.066 --> 01:22:29.151
- All right, are you ready?
- Ready for what?

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:30.361
For this.

01:22:31.195 --> 01:22:33.614
There's a window, Jack!
There's a window!

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.660
Is that your gun or are
you gettin' excited, man?

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:40.329
Get off me. Get off.

01:22:41.581 --> 01:22:44.166
Police business. We're
right on out of here.

01:22:47.003 --> 01:22:50.756
- Can you make it down to the lobby?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:53.676
The elevator was broken.

01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:35.759
Has anybody ever told you
you're a real pain in the ass?

01:23:36.052 --> 01:23:37.136
All the time.

01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:43.392
You're not gonna have to hear it anymore.

01:23:44.852 --> 01:23:48.230
I'm gonna take care of you
like I took care of your ex-wife.

01:24:14.674 --> 01:24:16.008
Here we are.

01:24:17.885 --> 01:24:20.596
When you wake up in the
morning and look in the mirror...

01:24:20.888 --> 01:24:23.140
...I think you're probably happy...

01:24:23.432 --> 01:24:26.601
...pleased at what you see.
And that disturbs me.

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:30.940
So, I'm gonna take it on
as my responsibility...

01:24:31.232 --> 01:24:34.652
...to make sure that you never
get to look in the mirror again.

01:24:34.944 --> 01:24:38.781
I woke up happy, I'm going to bed
happy 'cause you're gonna be dead.

01:25:21.991 --> 01:25:23.450
Take your best shot.

01:25:26.078 --> 01:25:27.704
No, I said, "Best shot."

01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:30.665
Boring.

01:25:42.595 --> 01:25:44.513
Is that the best you got, boy?

01:25:46.849 --> 01:25:50.227
If that's the best you got,
I'm just gonna have to kill you.

01:25:54.065 --> 01:25:55.524
Is that all you got?

01:26:14.377 --> 01:26:17.505
You don't look like you're
gonna be wakin' up happy now.

01:26:58.921 --> 01:26:59.922
Hey, Capt.

01:27:00.256 --> 01:27:02.049
You're looking a little rough there, Campbell.

01:27:02.341 --> 01:27:04.593
Yeah, well, they say I'm gonna make it.

01:27:05.261 --> 01:27:06.887
Guess I owe you an apology, Jack.

01:27:07.179 --> 01:27:08.805
God, wouldn't that be nice?

01:27:09.765 --> 01:27:11.683
Well, you're not gonna get it.

01:27:12.977 --> 01:27:14.687
But I do owe it to you.

01:27:15.938 --> 01:27:18.190
Do me a favor, tell my wife I'm alive and well.

01:27:18.482 --> 01:27:19.691
You got it.

01:27:20.025 --> 01:27:20.900
Feel better, kid.

01:27:21.193 --> 01:27:21.943
Yeah.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:27.825
Say, Jack. How about we not
talk for a couple of days?

01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:30.118
Somethin' I said?

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:33.705
It's just that ever since
you started bein' my partner...

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:36.834
...I've been beat up, blown up...

01:27:38.335 --> 01:27:40.378
...shot, kicked out a window...

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:44.466
...all my worldly possessions
burnt to a crisp.

01:27:45.009 --> 01:27:46.885
Basically, I'm homeless.

01:27:48.095 --> 01:27:50.222
Not one good thing has
happened since I met you.

01:27:50.514 --> 01:27:51.890
You got to try powdered deer penis.

01:27:52.183 --> 01:27:53.392
That should count for something.

01:27:53.684 --> 01:27:56.478
Don't call me, Jack.
Don't leave me a message.

01:27:56.771 --> 01:28:00.733
Don't fax me. if I see a bird on my
window with a message on its foot...

01:28:01.025 --> 01:28:02.776
...I'm throwin' him back out.

01:28:03.068 --> 01:28:03.693
Don't send flowers.

01:28:05.488 --> 01:28:07.156
Forget you know me, Jack!
