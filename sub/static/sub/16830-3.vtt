00:40.962 --> 00:43.964
- Hey, over here. Miss Morrison, please!
- Miss Morrison.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.032
Can we get a comment?

00:45.066 --> 00:46.100
To your right, Hayes.

00:46.134 --> 00:48.035
- Miss Morrison.
- Miss Morrison.

00:48.069 --> 00:49.536
Hayes... Hayes, your thoughts

00:49.571 --> 00:51.105
on your mother's surge in the polls.

00:51.139 --> 00:53.073
The people of New York State recognize

00:53.108 --> 00:55.109
what a wonderful senator
my mother is going to be.

00:55.143 --> 00:57.811
Some are saying the bump
is connected to your success

00:57.846 --> 01:00.247
as the new head of
the Conviction Integrity Unit.

01:00.282 --> 01:02.983
I'm not surprised.
Hayes is doing a fantastic job.

01:03.018 --> 01:05.986
Why wouldn't New York want more
of the Morrison women's mojo?

01:06.021 --> 01:07.554
A picture together?

01:07.589 --> 01:09.957
You look amazing, as always.

01:09.991 --> 01:11.959
You look like the second oboe player

01:11.993 --> 01:13.260
in the Garden State Philharmonic.

01:13.295 --> 01:15.296
D.A. Wallace, did the Innocence Project

01:15.330 --> 01:16.964
inspire you to start the CIU?

01:16.998 --> 01:19.466
No. Their sole focus is
getting people out of prison.

01:19.501 --> 01:21.302
The CIU's job is to review convictions.

01:21.336 --> 01:23.470
Our clients could be innocent.
They could be guilty.

01:23.505 --> 01:25.572
Our job is to make sure
the system got it right.

01:25.607 --> 01:27.308
- That justice was actually just.
- Mm-hmm.

01:27.342 --> 01:29.443
Which is basically lawyer speak

01:29.477 --> 01:31.245
for you get good guys out of jail.

01:31.279 --> 01:33.480
- Good, bad isn't the issue.
- Thank you.

01:33.515 --> 01:35.949
Debating moral/legal
distinctions with the press.

01:35.984 --> 01:37.251
You know better than that.

01:37.285 --> 01:40.988
They're reducing the CIU
to a noble-cause sound bite.

01:41.022 --> 01:43.123
Only you would be bothered by that.

01:44.359 --> 01:46.960
D.A. Wallace, how did you know
that a former First Daughter,

01:46.995 --> 01:48.996
someone who grew up with
so much privilege,

01:49.030 --> 01:50.631
would do such a great job running CIU?

01:50.656 --> 01:52.433
If you'd known Hayes Morrison
as long as I have,

01:52.467 --> 01:55.035
you would know that describing
her as a former First Daughter

01:55.069 --> 01:56.100
is selling her short.

01:56.125 --> 01:57.738
She's passionate. She's tenacious.

01:57.772 --> 01:59.573
She's a brilliant defense attorney.

01:59.607 --> 02:01.041
And a bit of a party girl

02:01.075 --> 02:02.576
who's had a few brushes with the law.

02:02.610 --> 02:04.445
Unless that's all behind you now.

02:04.479 --> 02:06.380
Have you reformed or lost your edge?

02:06.414 --> 02:08.414
I don't know about that.

02:08.449 --> 02:09.583
That's all in the past.

02:09.616 --> 02:11.285
Why do you think I hired her?

02:11.319 --> 02:13.654
You're looking at
the new Hayes Morrison.

02:53.394 --> 02:55.496
I'll call security.

02:55.530 --> 02:57.631
About time you slackers got here.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.234
Ohh.

03:00.268 --> 03:01.568
Were you sleeping under there?

03:01.603 --> 03:03.170
Ohh. Just a quick catnap.

03:04.038 --> 03:06.240
Our new case.

03:08.143 --> 03:09.443
Rodney Landon?

03:09.477 --> 03:11.612
I was hoping for a Charles-Manson-type

03:11.646 --> 03:13.113
with new DNA evidence,

03:13.148 --> 03:15.115
but he's the closest I could find.

03:15.150 --> 03:17.117
You really want to spend
the next five days on this?

03:17.152 --> 03:19.453
The Veteran's Alliance submitted it.

03:19.487 --> 03:22.423
A pretty solid argument the
prosecution rushed to judgment.

03:22.457 --> 03:24.425
Because allegations
against law enforcement

03:24.459 --> 03:25.426
are always true.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.694
Landon's an insane bigot.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.564
He gave speeches
calling for a "new crusade

03:30.598 --> 03:32.378
to confront the Muslim infection."

03:32.403 --> 03:34.301
I'm sorry.
Did I sleep through the repeal

03:34.335 --> 03:36.270
of the First Amendment?

03:36.304 --> 03:38.972
Being a hateful jackass isn't grounds
for four life sentences.

03:38.997 --> 03:41.789
No, but celebrating
the 10th anniversary of 9/11

03:41.814 --> 03:43.277
by bombing a mosque is.

03:43.311 --> 03:45.045
Four people were killed,
including the imam.

03:45.079 --> 03:47.812
A terrible crime.
Whoever did it should die in prison.

03:47.837 --> 03:50.050
I'm just not sure it's him.

03:50.084 --> 03:52.953
You said you wanted poster boys.
Landon's a long way from...

03:52.987 --> 03:54.054
Sometimes, I like poster boys.

03:54.088 --> 03:56.909
Other times, I like tattooed
bikers who pull my hair,

03:56.934 --> 03:59.960
especially when everyone is expecting me
to show up with a poster boy.

03:59.994 --> 04:01.359
The CIU is here to save

04:01.384 --> 04:02.922
anyone who was shafted by the system,

04:02.947 --> 04:03.997
bigots included.

04:04.032 --> 04:05.132
And in the process,

04:05.166 --> 04:06.733
we will challenge the cops,

04:06.768 --> 04:09.002
prosecutors, the scientists,

04:09.037 --> 04:11.772
and the bleeding hearts.

04:11.806 --> 04:13.397
Anyone who isn't down

04:13.422 --> 04:15.819
to fight like hell
for the unpopular causes

04:15.844 --> 04:17.478
as well as the popular ones...

04:17.512 --> 04:19.446
don't let the door hit you in the ass.

04:20.447 --> 04:22.316
Get the crime board ready.

04:22.350 --> 04:24.651
I need to take a quick shower
and change my underwear.

04:25.620 --> 04:27.087
Kidding.

04:27.121 --> 04:28.255
I never wear underwear.

www.addic7ed.com

04:40.668 --> 04:41.668
I was in prison with guys

04:41.703 --> 04:43.270
whose lawyers slept through trial.

04:43.304 --> 04:45.339
Here we are defending
some degenerate bigot.

04:45.373 --> 04:46.607
You really okay with this?

04:46.641 --> 04:48.108
Am I annoyed that Hayes picked this case

04:48.142 --> 04:49.209
just to piss people off? Yeah.

04:49.244 --> 04:51.645
She does love a reaction.

04:51.679 --> 04:53.347
If I got riled over every bad guy

04:53.381 --> 04:56.650
who said something racist,
sexist, or just plain stupid...

04:56.684 --> 04:57.618
The guy's either guilty or not.

04:57.652 --> 04:59.386
The thoughts in his head
don't matter to me.

04:59.420 --> 05:02.189
They should. They matter to the law.

05:02.223 --> 05:04.391
Hate crimes aren't just
an attack on an individual.

05:04.425 --> 05:06.226
An entire group is terrorized.

05:06.261 --> 05:08.529
If he actually backed
his words with violence.

05:08.563 --> 05:09.530
So you don't think he's guilty?

05:09.564 --> 05:11.532
What I know is
our job requires an open mind,

05:11.566 --> 05:13.166
our boss wants to work the case,

05:13.201 --> 05:15.135
and the law guarantees bigots
a fair trial.

05:15.169 --> 05:18.238
So, let's go hear
this bigot's side of the story.

05:21.876 --> 05:23.510
I'm not a bigot.

05:23.545 --> 05:26.747
I'm a professor, a political activist,

05:26.781 --> 05:28.815
and I had nothing to do
with that bombing.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.851
You were seen on
the exterior security cameras.

05:30.885 --> 05:33.387
Walking my dog. It isn't a crime.

05:33.421 --> 05:34.555
But casing a bomb target is.

05:34.589 --> 05:36.390
You served in the military,

05:36.424 --> 05:38.592
Special Forces, explosives training.

05:38.626 --> 05:39.927
I risked my life,

05:39.961 --> 05:43.697
saw my friends lose their lives
to protect freedom and justice.

05:43.731 --> 05:48.068
And then I get home and have
my freedom of speech assaulted.

05:48.102 --> 05:49.570
You're not in prison for what you said.

05:49.604 --> 05:53.173
I was arrested
an hour after that bombing.

05:53.207 --> 05:54.675
They didn't have fingerprints.

05:54.709 --> 05:56.443
They didn't have me on camera
inside the mosque.

05:56.477 --> 05:59.580
All they had was my history
of speaking the truth

05:59.614 --> 06:01.281
about Muslim extremists.

06:01.316 --> 06:03.383
You mean when you referred
to Muslims as terrorists,

06:03.418 --> 06:04.585
a threat to our way of life.

06:04.619 --> 06:07.387
Islam is not a religion of peace.

06:07.422 --> 06:10.290
It's a militant movement
to create a global caliphate

06:10.325 --> 06:12.192
by any means necessary.

06:12.226 --> 06:15.762
ISIS recruits 1,000
new members every month,

06:15.797 --> 06:18.599
and each one of them
would gladly blow themselves up

06:18.633 --> 06:21.201
to kill as many Americans as possible.

06:21.235 --> 06:23.437
The Crips and Bloods kill
way more Americans than ISIS.

06:23.471 --> 06:25.572
So do drunk drivers, backyard pools,

06:25.607 --> 06:26.807
and killer bees.

06:26.841 --> 06:29.543
See, this is a healthy debate,
which we're allowed to have

06:29.577 --> 06:31.778
because our Constitution
wasn't written by a Muslim.

06:31.813 --> 06:34.481
Your case isn't about freedom of speech.

06:34.515 --> 06:36.316
My speech put me
in the police cross hairs,

06:36.351 --> 06:40.220
and once I was there,
they didn't look at anyone else.

06:40.254 --> 06:42.322
The forensics team
didn't collect your words.

06:42.357 --> 06:43.590
They collected bomb fragments

06:43.625 --> 06:46.226
and matched the bomb you blogged
instructions on how to build.

06:46.260 --> 06:47.794
And the cops picked you
up an hour after the attack

06:47.829 --> 06:50.464
with explosives residue on your clothes,

06:50.498 --> 06:52.432
so explain that, Professor.

06:52.467 --> 06:54.635
The Counter Terrorism Unit

06:54.669 --> 06:56.903
did not frame Rodney Landon.

06:56.938 --> 06:59.272
They're the most prestigious
unit in the NYPD.

06:59.307 --> 07:00.641
The best of the best.

07:00.675 --> 07:02.476
Remember when I talked about
challenging the cops?

07:02.510 --> 07:04.811
With a totally unfounded allegation?

07:04.846 --> 07:07.314
We don't know that until
we fully investigate his claims

07:07.348 --> 07:09.249
that CTU planted the explosives residue.

07:09.283 --> 07:10.751
Huh.

07:10.785 --> 07:12.352
Brown really looks good on you.

07:12.387 --> 07:13.920
So you disagree with Landon's views,

07:13.955 --> 07:15.455
but you'll trust him over the cops?

07:15.490 --> 07:16.657
No, this is not about trusting him

07:16.691 --> 07:18.425
or his views, which I find repulsive.

07:18.459 --> 07:20.627
It's about investigating his claim.

07:20.662 --> 07:22.696
And what happened to not caring
what's in a perp's head?

07:22.730 --> 07:23.864
I don't.

07:23.898 --> 07:25.934
I care about what comes out
of his mouth, which is a lie.

07:25.959 --> 07:28.602
- The residue wasn't planted.
- Fine. Prove it.

07:33.402 --> 07:34.541
Hey.

07:34.575 --> 07:35.809
Frankie.

07:35.843 --> 07:37.377
Good to see ya.

07:37.412 --> 07:38.845
You too, Professor Shaunessy.

07:38.870 --> 07:42.176
Thanks for helping us out.
My colleague Tess Larson.

07:42.201 --> 07:44.737
Professor Shaunessy was
my Bomb Scene Investigation instructor.

07:44.762 --> 07:46.553
Taught me everything I know
about explosions.

07:46.587 --> 07:48.388
Oh, he taught me a few things, too,

07:48.423 --> 07:49.823
like how to hot-wire a car.

07:51.025 --> 07:53.193
Let's see if we can't sort out
your nitrogen oxide problem.

07:53.227 --> 07:54.828
So, I built this site

07:54.862 --> 07:57.631
to replicate the crime scene
where the bomb went off.

07:57.665 --> 07:59.700
Shouldn't we be doing this inside?

07:59.734 --> 08:01.501
The bomb went off in the imam's office.

08:01.536 --> 08:03.970
All we need is the residue from
the device once it detonates.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.839
This way, no structures get destroyed,

08:05.873 --> 08:07.474
which can ruin some of the fun.

08:07.508 --> 08:10.410
And what's the nitrogen oxide problem?

08:10.445 --> 08:13.413
The bomb used at the mosque
was structurally identical

08:13.448 --> 08:16.349
to the one Landon described
how to build in his blog,

08:16.384 --> 08:19.019
but the analysis
of the debris post-explosion

08:19.053 --> 08:21.755
indicated a slightly different
mixture of explosive chemicals.

08:21.789 --> 08:24.324
Doesn't that suggest
Landon didn't build the bomb?

08:24.358 --> 08:25.726
Well, it's a possibility,

08:25.760 --> 08:27.661
but chemical reactions
are unpredictable.

08:27.695 --> 08:28.995
The only way to know for sure

08:29.030 --> 08:31.331
what the exact residue
of Landon's device would be

08:31.365 --> 08:32.866
is to test it in the real world.

08:32.900 --> 08:37.037
And if our test residue doesn't
match the crime residue...

08:37.071 --> 08:40.440
Chances are, your guy's not the bomber.

08:40.475 --> 08:43.543
We're reviewing
the Rodney Landon conviction.

08:43.578 --> 08:47.047
Provocative. How unlike you.

08:47.081 --> 08:49.349
Uh, by me, you mean
"the new Hayes Morrison"?

08:49.383 --> 08:50.751
I knew you hated that.

08:50.785 --> 08:54.287
You thought I wouldn't want you
reviewing this case?

08:54.322 --> 08:55.922
He's hardly a noble cause.

08:55.957 --> 08:57.557
Bigots deserve justice, too.

08:57.592 --> 08:59.693
And it's a perfect demonstration

08:59.727 --> 09:02.629
that CIU doesn't just get people
out of prison.

09:02.663 --> 09:04.898
Some convictions deserve to be upheld.

09:04.932 --> 09:07.033
You're really that confident?

09:07.068 --> 09:09.569
Landon's conviction was solid.

09:09.604 --> 09:11.605
And I appreciate the update.

09:11.639 --> 09:13.406
Although I'm aware that by saying that

09:13.441 --> 09:15.475
I may have just ensured
I never get another one.

09:15.510 --> 09:17.377
And there I go
getting predictable again.

09:17.411 --> 09:18.945
- Not a bad thing, you know?
- Hmm?

09:18.980 --> 09:20.480
It's how you know that people know you.

09:20.515 --> 09:21.715
Or how you know you're falling

09:21.749 --> 09:23.416
into a dull, boring,
comfortable pattern.

09:23.451 --> 09:25.318
Fine. Stay dangerous.

09:25.353 --> 09:27.921
Ride your proverbial motorcycle.
Just wear a helmet.

09:27.955 --> 09:29.556
Where's the fun in that?

09:34.762 --> 09:38.398
The bomber knew
the imam's schedule exactly.

09:38.432 --> 09:40.100
Entered through his office
in the morning,

09:40.134 --> 09:42.569
when he knew no one would be there.

09:44.138 --> 09:48.074
The bomb was constructed
from a block of homemade C-4

09:48.109 --> 09:49.843
hidden inside a three-ring binder,

09:49.877 --> 09:51.645
covered in ball bearings.

09:51.679 --> 09:53.413
A number 10 detonator

09:53.447 --> 09:55.949
was inserted into the explosive material

09:55.983 --> 09:58.118
and connected to a trip wire

09:58.152 --> 10:00.453
fastened to the underside of the desk

10:00.488 --> 10:02.122
with a half-inch steel staple.

10:15.703 --> 10:17.971
The bomb was set to detonate
when the drawer opened.

10:23.878 --> 10:29.449
The imam and his associates
came back from lunch at 1:15.

10:29.483 --> 10:32.819
They walked into his office
like it was any other day.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.795
They never knew what was coming.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.367
When a bomb detonates,

10:47.401 --> 10:49.870
people say it's like ice picks
plunging into your ears.

10:49.904 --> 10:52.038
The shock wave can rupture organs,

10:52.073 --> 10:54.875
even liquefy your eyes.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.582
_

12:24.100 --> 12:27.703
Thank you so much
for inviting me into your home.

12:29.472 --> 12:32.641
Your children are beautiful.

12:33.177 --> 12:35.011
They would make their father very proud.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.815
He watches them from wherever he is now.

12:38.850 --> 12:40.417
From Jannah, I'm sure.

12:44.355 --> 12:46.156
Let's have a seat.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.697
My sympathies
to all of you for your loss

12:53.731 --> 12:56.533
and for any further upset
caused by our investigation.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.301
Why are you doing this?

12:59.537 --> 13:02.672
The Conviction Integrity Unit
has a mandate to...

13:02.707 --> 13:06.209
Shut up. Spare us your fake sympathy.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.144
You're gonna set a murderer free.

13:08.179 --> 13:11.648
Rodney Landon
and every person in this room

13:11.682 --> 13:14.317
- deserves the same protection...
- Just stop!

13:24.963 --> 13:28.365
My husband wasn't just a Muslim.

13:28.399 --> 13:31.935
He was a father, a lover,
a soccer coach.

13:31.970 --> 13:34.871
He was a beautiful human being.

13:36.574 --> 13:40.410
Not just a victim whose wife
you have the chore of notifying.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.221
I appreciate you telling us in person.

13:53.091 --> 13:56.393
I sincerely hope that
Landon was justly convicted,

13:56.427 --> 14:00.397
but if there was a mistake,
even a legal technicality,

14:00.431 --> 14:02.899
you have to follow the law.

14:02.934 --> 14:04.901
It's what makes us civilized.

14:04.936 --> 14:07.938
Oh, that's very forgiving of you,

14:07.972 --> 14:10.907
considering Landon's beliefs.

14:10.942 --> 14:13.477
"The recompense of evil
is punishment like it,

14:13.511 --> 14:17.114
but whoever forgives and amends,

14:17.148 --> 14:19.149
he shall have his reward from Allah."

14:19.183 --> 14:22.019
Is that from the Qur'an?

14:22.053 --> 14:24.087
I wish that didn't surprise you.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.025
The Muslims they show on the news,

14:28.059 --> 14:32.329
the ones who have distorted
and hijacked my faith...

14:32.363 --> 14:35.332
they don't understand Islam
any more than you do.

14:45.977 --> 14:46.977
Hey, Frankie.

14:47.011 --> 14:50.147
The nitrogen oxide residue
on the debris in my test

14:50.181 --> 14:51.948
doesn't match the forensics
from the crime scene.

14:51.983 --> 14:53.517
Can you repeat that in English?

14:54.485 --> 14:56.486
I don't think Landon built that bomb.

15:06.097 --> 15:08.165
Frankie earns a gold star

15:08.199 --> 15:10.233
for coming to the bigot's
forensic defense.

15:10.268 --> 15:11.811
Just because the bomb
wasn't a perfect match

15:11.836 --> 15:13.154
doesn't mean it wasn't Landon.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.748
He could've made a mistake
mixing the chemicals

15:14.773 --> 15:16.131
or used a different recipe.

15:16.156 --> 15:17.274
I doubt it.

15:17.308 --> 15:19.725
He's experienced enough to know
it's not like making brownies.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.902
You know, don't just toss in
an extra pinch of nitrogen.

15:21.927 --> 15:23.058
Well, I'm experienced enough to know

15:23.083 --> 15:24.618
that there's no such thing
as a perfect crime.

15:24.643 --> 15:25.727
Criminals make mistakes.

15:25.752 --> 15:27.960
But as far as we know,
Landon's not a criminal.

15:27.985 --> 15:28.952
At least not yet.

15:28.986 --> 15:29.986
Well, you were the one who said

15:30.021 --> 15:31.321
his thoughts were already a crime.

15:31.355 --> 15:32.822
Actually, I didn't.

15:32.857 --> 15:35.358
I agreed with the law that says
hate crimes should be punished

15:35.393 --> 15:36.633
more severely than other types.

15:36.660 --> 15:39.362
Thought police versus former police.

15:39.397 --> 15:40.430
Interesting.

15:41.499 --> 15:43.833
I'm gonna re-check the test
on his clothes next.

15:43.868 --> 15:45.902
It's rare, but some
non-explosive materials

15:45.936 --> 15:48.204
can cause a false positive to the test.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.873
So can planting explosives residue.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.875
I researched lawsuits against CTU.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.477
I figured if Landon was right
about them planting evidence,

15:54.512 --> 15:56.212
his case wouldn't have been
the only time.

15:56.247 --> 15:57.414
No other suits were filed

15:57.448 --> 15:59.031
by suspects alleging planted evidence,

15:59.056 --> 16:02.318
but there was one file by a detective
who worked Landon's case.

16:02.353 --> 16:05.555
Stan Sowinski claims
that "work-related stress"

16:05.589 --> 16:08.525
caused by extreme pressure
to meet arrest quotas,

16:08.559 --> 16:11.928
close cases, and sometimes
even plant evidence.

16:11.962 --> 16:13.730
CTU settled for an undisclosed amount.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.666
Looks like Landon's
totally unfounded allegation

16:16.700 --> 16:17.901
just got founded.

16:24.499 --> 16:26.267
How do you like
the private-security game?

16:26.301 --> 16:28.769
Beats NYPD any day of the week.

16:28.803 --> 16:30.437
Double the pay, half the B.S.

16:30.472 --> 16:32.128
Where's it come out
on planting evidence?

16:32.153 --> 16:34.234
You do more or less of that
than you did with CTU?

16:35.039 --> 16:37.490
What happened to "CIU might be hiring"?

16:37.515 --> 16:39.146
- Let's talk about...
- Rodney Landon.

16:40.515 --> 16:42.049
Can't help you.

16:42.083 --> 16:44.451
We don't want your help.
We want the truth.

16:44.486 --> 16:47.628
Which CTU officer planted the
explosives residue on Landon's clothes?

16:47.653 --> 16:49.390
No one. Landon was a good collar.

16:49.424 --> 16:51.492
So it's just a coincidence
that you and Landon

16:51.526 --> 16:53.703
accused your unit
of the exact same thing?

16:53.728 --> 16:55.329
Look. I lied.

16:56.130 --> 16:57.832
No one in CTU ever planted evidence

16:57.866 --> 16:59.533
or pressured anyone to plant evidence.

16:59.568 --> 17:01.535
I made it up for the lawsuit.

17:01.570 --> 17:03.537
You falsely accused your own unit?

17:03.572 --> 17:06.674
After 9/11, I worked 18-hour days,

17:06.708 --> 17:07.907
seven days a week.

17:07.943 --> 17:11.512
I wasn't sleeping.
Kept having anxiety attacks.

17:11.546 --> 17:13.914
My wife dumped me
and then hit me up for alimony.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.883
I had a breakdown.

17:15.916 --> 17:19.019
I was... disabled. I couldn't work.

17:19.054 --> 17:21.856
And the settlement they offered
just wasn't enough.

17:21.890 --> 17:24.325
My lawyer said if I wanted
to see any real cash,

17:24.358 --> 17:26.327
I needed to take it up a notch or two.

17:26.361 --> 17:27.994
So what about the other detectives?

17:28.029 --> 17:30.564
Could any of them
have contaminated his clothes?

17:30.599 --> 17:32.399
Not a chance.

17:32.434 --> 17:33.901
Working in CTU,

17:33.935 --> 17:36.737
hearing all that chatter
from the radical Muslim cells,

17:36.771 --> 17:37.905
the guys on that case

17:37.939 --> 17:40.307
were more likely to agree
with Landon than to frame him.

17:45.241 --> 17:48.076
Sowinski is a lying,
money-grubbing dirtbag

17:48.101 --> 17:50.787
but draws the line
at framing someone like Landon.

17:50.812 --> 17:53.199
Sowinski's claims were bogus.
CTU is a dead end.

17:53.224 --> 17:54.784
They didn't plant evidence
on Landon's clothes.

17:54.809 --> 17:56.757
So, on to alternate suspects.

17:56.791 --> 17:58.926
Tess has been compiling a list
of other anti-Muslim activists.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.728
Don't forget the Malcolm X angle.

18:00.762 --> 18:03.297
He was killed by rivals, not racists.

18:03.331 --> 18:04.771
Check out to see if anyone benefited

18:04.799 --> 18:07.868
from a leadership position at the mosque
at the time of the bombing.

18:07.903 --> 18:10.504
I need to talk to you.

18:17.512 --> 18:20.414
Why the hell are your people

18:20.448 --> 18:22.483
sniffing around
the Counter Terrorism Unit?

18:22.517 --> 18:24.752
They're reviewing Landon's case,
like I told you.

18:24.786 --> 18:27.755
Reviewing a case means
re-running forensics,

18:27.789 --> 18:30.724
checking alibis,
widening the suspect pool,

18:30.759 --> 18:31.892
not alleging corruption

18:31.927 --> 18:33.994
in one of the NYPD's
most elite divisions.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.429
This is my unit, my investigation,

18:35.463 --> 18:36.797
and I will run it
the way that I see fit.

18:36.831 --> 18:38.465
No, you will not.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.069
This line of attack on CTU stops now!

18:45.340 --> 18:47.708
Message received.

18:53.114 --> 18:54.815
I'm sorry.

18:54.849 --> 18:56.450
I have a temper.

18:56.484 --> 18:58.419
You have a rebellious streak.

18:58.453 --> 19:02.456
We've got to set those aside,
and you need to trust me.

19:02.490 --> 19:04.725
CTU did not frame Landon.

19:06.461 --> 19:08.829
That unit is too important
to the city's safety

19:08.863 --> 19:10.764
to have its credibility undermined

19:10.799 --> 19:12.666
by one baseless allegation,

19:12.701 --> 19:14.969
which is what could happen
if you keep digging into this.

19:16.638 --> 19:19.106
Do you hear me?

19:19.140 --> 19:22.109
Loud and clear.

19:22.143 --> 19:23.978
Thank you.

19:43.732 --> 19:45.866
Uh, can we skip the part
where we pretend

19:45.900 --> 19:48.535
we didn't just hear everything
and cut to the chase?

19:48.570 --> 19:50.137
Why didn't you tell him
we were moving off CTU?

19:50.171 --> 19:51.872
Because we're not anymore.

19:51.906 --> 19:53.507
Sowinski was convincing.

19:53.541 --> 19:55.142
CTU didn't plant the explosives residue.

19:55.176 --> 19:57.511
Wallace is one of
the best trial lawyers I know

19:57.545 --> 19:59.480
because he remains completely objective.

19:59.514 --> 20:01.849
If he's pissed off,
there are bigger implications.

20:01.883 --> 20:04.525
There is a connection
between CTU and this case.

20:04.550 --> 20:06.754
Wallace is trying to cover it up.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.622
We're gonna uncover it.

20:15.697 --> 20:17.031
What's up, guys?

20:18.099 --> 20:20.167
Hey.

20:23.238 --> 20:25.606
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.908
- You want a burger?
- No. Thanks. I can't stay.

20:27.942 --> 20:29.810
- How's my grandson?
- He's good.

20:29.844 --> 20:32.079
He got picked to be class rep
for student council.

20:32.113 --> 20:34.915
Nice.

20:34.949 --> 20:37.618
I need a favor with someone
in Counter Terrorism.

20:37.652 --> 20:40.888
CTU, huh? Don't know anybody there.

20:40.922 --> 20:43.057
Come on. You have friends
in every squad room in the city.

20:43.091 --> 20:45.459
Everyone I know is busy with
the current crop of criminals.

20:45.493 --> 20:47.094
Dad.

20:47.128 --> 20:49.029
A cop with your talent
shouldn't be wasting her time

20:49.064 --> 20:50.964
re-investigating old crimes.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.533
Perps already get a hundred appeals.

20:52.567 --> 20:54.635
Now we're gonna give them
a whole new investigation?

20:54.669 --> 20:57.604
You know this isn't my first
choice of job, either.

20:57.639 --> 21:00.707
But since I'm doing it,
I am not gonna half-ass it.

21:02.577 --> 21:05.212
I'll get my own source at CTU.

21:05.246 --> 21:07.714
Maxine.

21:07.749 --> 21:10.417
Let me make a few calls.

21:45.186 --> 21:46.587
Ow!

21:46.621 --> 21:47.988
Aah!

21:48.022 --> 21:49.990
I-I just want to talk.

21:50.024 --> 21:52.593
And you thought wearing a
ski mask was a good ice breaker?

21:52.627 --> 21:54.761
Your dad asked me to help you.

21:56.698 --> 21:58.899
Look, I work in CTU.

22:01.202 --> 22:02.836
So much for the Malcolm X theory.

22:02.871 --> 22:04.638
The new imam was hired
after a nationwide search.

22:04.672 --> 22:06.578
No one was promoted
in the wake of the bombing.

22:06.603 --> 22:08.337
And according to everyone
we spoke to at the mosque,

22:08.362 --> 22:11.906
Imam Abdullah was loved by kids,
counseled troubled teens,

22:11.931 --> 22:13.147
went out of his way to ensure

22:13.181 --> 22:15.649
that the young female members
felt respected.

22:15.683 --> 22:17.718
- Adored by all.
- Basically.

22:17.752 --> 22:20.787
I just got a tip from an inside source.

22:20.822 --> 22:23.593
CTU did not plant the residue
on Landon's clothes,

22:23.618 --> 22:27.257
but Wallace is covering something up.

22:27.282 --> 22:29.863
An off-the-books CTU surveillance team

22:29.898 --> 22:32.470
that was trailing Landon
in the weeks before the bombing.

22:32.495 --> 22:33.923
Did they see where he was that day?

22:33.948 --> 22:37.037
No. They were too busy breaking
in to Landon's apartment.

22:37.071 --> 22:38.972
Without a search warrant, I'm guessing.

22:39.007 --> 22:42.876
Damn. That's some old-school
J. Edgar Hoover-type shade.

22:42.911 --> 22:44.745
And while they're in his apartment,

22:44.779 --> 22:46.213
they found Landon's journal,

22:46.247 --> 22:47.981
which detailed a plan

22:48.016 --> 22:50.584
for the Clash of the Civilizations.

22:50.618 --> 22:52.819
Step one... blowing up a mosque.

22:53.755 --> 22:54.922
He's guilty.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.857
And I, for one, am happy

22:56.891 --> 22:59.927
that he is never,
ever getting out of prison.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.895
Turns out I do hate
the thoughts in his head.

23:01.930 --> 23:03.197
Yeah.

23:03.231 --> 23:05.666
Don't pop the champagne just yet.

23:05.700 --> 23:10.735
If that journal is the reason
CTU picked up Landon so quickly

23:10.760 --> 23:12.469
and that's why they caught him

23:12.494 --> 23:14.321
with the bomb residue on his clothes...

23:14.346 --> 23:15.550
Then that residue,

23:15.575 --> 23:17.344
the most damning evidence
against Landon,

23:17.378 --> 23:18.745
it can't be used in court.

23:18.780 --> 23:21.181
It's fruit from the poisonous tree.

23:21.216 --> 23:23.917
No dirty clothes, no clean conviction.

23:23.952 --> 23:25.185
So, wait.

23:25.220 --> 23:26.920
So, even if what CTU found
proves his guilt,

23:26.955 --> 23:28.922
by exposing that
they found it illegally...

23:28.957 --> 23:31.358
We might have just guaranteed
Landon a new trial.

23:32.727 --> 23:36.063
And taken away the state's
best shot at convicting him.

23:36.097 --> 23:38.497
And now we know why Wallace
wanted you to stay away from CTU.

23:46.196 --> 23:48.008
_

23:48.775 --> 23:51.410
An illegal search in Landon's apartment?

23:51.444 --> 23:53.812
This is why I told you to back off CTU.

23:53.847 --> 23:55.571
We're gonna have to give him
a new trial.

23:55.596 --> 23:57.683
- No, we don't.
- If CTU picked up Landon

23:57.717 --> 23:59.652
based on evidence
from an illegal search...

23:59.686 --> 24:01.954
CTU didn't pick up Landon.

24:01.988 --> 24:03.856
Beat cops did,
because he was on a watch list,

24:03.890 --> 24:05.257
on video casing the mosque,

24:05.292 --> 24:07.826
and all over the web
promoting anti-Muslim violence.

24:07.861 --> 24:10.329
That's a yellow brick road
of probable cause.

24:10.363 --> 24:12.331
There's no reason to compel a new trial,

24:12.365 --> 24:14.300
especially since it would subject CTU

24:14.334 --> 24:16.835
- to allegations of corruption.
- Which would be totally justified.

24:16.870 --> 24:19.004
But have already been taken care of.

24:19.039 --> 24:22.274
One commander and two officers
went rogue on Landon's case.

24:22.309 --> 24:24.877
All three of them got fired
a long time ago.

24:24.911 --> 24:27.446
The problem was solved.
The system worked.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.947
You need to walk away.

24:29.448 --> 24:33.675
The illegal search did not contribute
in any way to Landon's arrest?

24:33.700 --> 24:34.967
No.

24:38.562 --> 24:39.897
This is why you were certain

24:39.922 --> 24:41.453
that Landon's conviction would stand.

24:41.478 --> 24:45.030
You couldn't leave it alone.
I was trying to protect you.

24:45.065 --> 24:47.232
Neither the old or the new me
needs protection.

24:47.267 --> 24:49.168
Why is it impossible
for you to trust me?

24:49.202 --> 24:50.869
- Well, you hardly set a precedent.
- Hell no.

24:50.904 --> 24:54.039
You don't get to do that.
I never betrayed you.

24:54.074 --> 24:56.008
You're the one who left
in Chicago, not me.

24:56.042 --> 24:57.910
I left Chicago because I was fired.

24:57.944 --> 24:59.478
You got yourself fired

24:59.512 --> 25:02.047
because things were going well
for you, for us,

25:02.082 --> 25:03.215
and it freaked you out.

25:03.249 --> 25:05.050
Oh, right. This is all about you.

25:05.085 --> 25:06.596
No. This is all about you

25:06.621 --> 25:08.921
and your need to constantly
challenge people

25:08.955 --> 25:11.156
with the things that you say
and the cases you pick

25:11.191 --> 25:15.194
and how you defy everyone
and trust no one.

25:15.228 --> 25:17.396
And you never, ever admit
when you're wrong,

25:17.430 --> 25:19.998
no matter how much damage
you leave in your wake.

25:24.404 --> 25:27.172
All I'm doing is my job.

25:43.123 --> 25:46.392
You approached bombing the
mosque with military precision.

25:46.426 --> 25:49.128
You made a plan, wrote it up,
followed it through.

25:49.162 --> 25:50.796
Might as well admit it.

25:50.830 --> 25:53.399
My plan was to blow up a mosque,

25:53.433 --> 25:54.867
not that mosque,

25:54.901 --> 25:56.535
and with a much more lethal device.

25:56.569 --> 25:59.204
So you're not denying
the journal is yours.

25:59.239 --> 26:03.876
I don't need to deny it
because it's legally inadmissible.

26:03.910 --> 26:09.081
Must be, since NYPD never mentioned it.

26:09.115 --> 26:12.418
Smart as well as evil.

26:12.452 --> 26:13.552
When I joined the Army,

26:13.586 --> 26:15.320
I swore to defend the Constitution

26:15.355 --> 26:17.322
against any enemy, foreign or domestic.

26:17.357 --> 26:20.092
The best way to defend this country

26:20.126 --> 26:23.462
is to eradicate all Muslims
before they eradicate us.

26:23.496 --> 26:25.497
That's genocide.

26:25.532 --> 26:27.299
A just genocide.

26:27.333 --> 26:29.802
No different than fire-bombing Dresden

26:29.836 --> 26:31.937
or dropping two atomic bombs on Japan.

26:31.971 --> 26:34.139
What you are talking about
isn't a military tactic.

26:34.174 --> 26:35.841
It's mass murder, and you know it.

26:35.875 --> 26:38.110
The problem with the War on Terror

26:38.144 --> 26:40.345
is that it's not terrifying enough.

26:40.380 --> 26:42.314
ISIS doesn't deny their attacks.

26:42.348 --> 26:45.984
They film them, publicize them,
brag about them.

26:46.019 --> 26:48.015
If I executed that plan in the journal,

26:48.040 --> 26:49.073
I wouldn't deny it.

26:49.727 --> 26:51.590
But what I do deny

26:51.624 --> 26:55.127
is planting a bomb
that destroyed only one desk

26:55.161 --> 26:57.496
and the measly four Muslims near it.

27:00.633 --> 27:01.934
I'm done lying.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.203
I've done nothing I'm ashamed of.

27:04.237 --> 27:07.840
Or that I can be punished for.

27:07.874 --> 27:09.975
His defense was

27:10.009 --> 27:12.177
he was planning to blow up
a different mosque,

27:12.212 --> 27:14.112
full of worshipers, with a bigger bomb,

27:14.147 --> 27:15.647
and I believe him.

27:15.682 --> 27:18.150
He wouldn't have bothered
with such a low body count.

27:18.184 --> 27:19.351
Even if he didn't finish the plan,

27:19.385 --> 27:22.020
just starting it makes him
guilty of attempted mass murder.

27:22.055 --> 27:24.426
That's not what he's in prison for,
and he never will be

27:24.451 --> 27:27.159
because the only evidence came
from an illegal search.

27:27.193 --> 27:29.361
How can you take Landon's side?

27:29.395 --> 27:31.330
This is not about sides.
This is about the truth.

27:31.364 --> 27:33.465
If he isn't guilty, then
he doesn't belong in prison.

27:33.500 --> 27:36.535
Well, that's what I thought, too,
until I found out what he wants to do.

27:36.569 --> 27:37.652
I mean, prosecuting gangs,

27:37.677 --> 27:38.997
I had to put bad guys
back on the streets,

27:39.022 --> 27:42.007
but none of them were intent on killing
thousands of innocent people.

27:42.041 --> 27:43.642
How could you possibly let him out?

27:43.676 --> 27:46.211
Because he may be in prison
for a crime he didn't commit.

27:46.246 --> 27:48.313
Yeah, the key words here are "may be."

27:48.348 --> 27:49.915
We still haven't proven his innocence

27:49.949 --> 27:51.149
or anyone else's guilt.

27:51.184 --> 27:54.086
That's why we're gonna keep
looking at alternate suspects

27:54.120 --> 27:55.420
and exploring the possibility

27:55.455 --> 27:57.913
that explosives residue found
on Landon's clothing

27:57.938 --> 27:58.945
was a false positive.

27:58.970 --> 28:00.392
Hayes! We get it!

28:00.417 --> 28:02.800
This unit challenges the establishment,

28:02.825 --> 28:04.315
defends the indefensible,

28:04.340 --> 28:05.900
and gives the finger to public opinion.

28:07.100 --> 28:10.936
And at the head,
defying all expectations...

28:10.970 --> 28:12.471
Hayes Morrison.

28:14.107 --> 28:15.574
But innocent or guilty,

28:15.608 --> 28:18.410
Rodney Landon needs to stay in prison.

28:20.647 --> 28:22.414
That's not our decision to make.

28:24.617 --> 28:26.118
Let's get back to work.

28:26.396 --> 28:29.109
No. No. Sam's right.

28:29.134 --> 28:30.234
I'm done.

28:31.057 --> 28:32.958
I mean, we have to have
some kind of priority,

28:32.992 --> 28:34.459
and this bigot ain't gonna be mine.

28:34.494 --> 28:35.694
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I am.

28:35.728 --> 28:37.062
Okay, you're fired.

28:51.611 --> 28:53.645
Frankie, no! You can't.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.813
This is a good job,

28:54.847 --> 28:57.115
one that's not easy for someone
with your record to get.

28:57.150 --> 29:00.285
Don't throw it away just because...

29:00.320 --> 29:03.221
because your boss is being a bitch.

29:09.783 --> 29:12.264
Well, Frankie, the bitch is asking...
in or out?

29:18.137 --> 29:19.571
In.

29:31.654 --> 29:32.725
Nice work.

29:45.633 --> 29:47.430
_

29:47.539 --> 29:51.430
I'm sorry. Jackson had this thing
tonight, and I had to speak to someone.

29:52.869 --> 29:54.746
You provoke your team to mutiny

29:54.771 --> 29:57.146
and then come to me
when no one else is available.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.727
Old Hayes Morrison in full effect.

29:59.761 --> 30:03.230
What if the team's right?

30:03.264 --> 30:05.833
We don't put people in prison
because they're dangerous.

30:05.867 --> 30:08.068
We put them there
because they're guilty.

30:08.103 --> 30:10.799
I could drop Landon's case,
move on to the next one.

30:10.824 --> 30:12.690
Could, but you're not going to.

30:13.783 --> 30:16.343
If you prove Landon
didn't bomb the mosque,

30:16.378 --> 30:17.744
you'll get him released,

30:17.769 --> 30:21.660
and then I'll tell CTU to put
him under 24-hour surveillance.

30:22.550 --> 30:24.222
They couldn't keep that up forever.

30:24.247 --> 30:25.675
He's smart. He'll bide his time.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.968
We're lawyers, Hayes, not superheroes.

30:29.198 --> 30:30.832
Or provocateurs.

30:34.929 --> 30:37.164
The biggest fight I ever had with my mom

30:37.198 --> 30:39.407
was the day I bought a motorcycle.

30:39.601 --> 30:41.869
I was 24, living on my own.

30:42.110 --> 30:44.149
She still made me sell it.

30:45.765 --> 30:47.399
She was right.

30:47.424 --> 30:49.010
Enough with the motorcycle metaphors.

30:49.035 --> 30:50.135
I get it.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.877
I liked your mom. She was cool.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.828
She hated you.

30:55.312 --> 30:56.640
My mom hates you, too.

30:56.665 --> 30:59.634
Oh, if she did,
you'd probably like me more.

31:00.083 --> 31:03.186
I should go. Big day tomorrow.

31:03.220 --> 31:06.533
Riding my convictions full speed
into a wall.

31:06.558 --> 31:09.058
Don't forget your dad. He loves me, too.

31:09.092 --> 31:12.628
My dad loves everybody,
and everybody loves my dad,

31:12.663 --> 31:14.878
especially the cute, young...

31:16.862 --> 31:18.057
What?

31:20.167 --> 31:21.556
I got to go.

31:27.411 --> 31:30.213
Frankie re-checked
the explosives residue test

31:30.247 --> 31:31.480
on Landon's clothes.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.916
The positive residue test
could've been caused

31:33.951 --> 31:35.518
by the nitrogen-based fertilizer

31:35.552 --> 31:37.220
from the dog park near his house.

31:37.254 --> 31:39.188
That's the only thing left
connecting him.

31:39.223 --> 31:40.736
I'm glad you didn't bail.

31:42.900 --> 31:46.529
When I said to Imam Abdullah's
wife he was in heaven, Jannah,

31:46.563 --> 31:47.992
she said nothing.

31:48.017 --> 31:50.805
Maybe we've all been thinking
too much like Landon...

31:50.830 --> 31:53.705
only thinking of Abdullah
as a Muslim, not as a man.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.538
But he was a man.

31:55.572 --> 31:57.789
A warm, friendly, popular man

31:57.814 --> 31:59.941
known to closely mentor and nurture

31:59.966 --> 32:02.988
the women he worked with,
just like my dad.

32:03.013 --> 32:06.916
The first time I found out
my dad cheated on my mom,

32:06.950 --> 32:08.351
I walked in.

32:08.385 --> 32:09.485
There was broken glass everywhere.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.054
I thought we'd been robbed.

32:11.088 --> 32:13.056
It seemed impossible until I realized

32:13.090 --> 32:15.358
every frame that had
my father's picture in it

32:15.392 --> 32:17.060
was shattered on the floor.

32:17.094 --> 32:18.828
What does that have to do with
finding the imam's wife

32:18.862 --> 32:19.896
on the security videos?

32:19.930 --> 32:20.797
Yeah, we already know

32:20.831 --> 32:22.832
she visited the mosque almost every day.

32:22.866 --> 32:24.200
It's not just about the mosque.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.369
It's what I noticed
when I visited her home.

32:35.946 --> 32:37.013
The imam's wife

32:37.047 --> 32:39.882
has pictures of her children
everywhere in her house,

32:39.917 --> 32:41.951
but not a single one of her husband.

32:41.985 --> 32:44.253
Maybe, like my mom,

32:44.288 --> 32:46.956
Kadisha couldn't stand
looking at his face anymore.

32:46.990 --> 32:49.759
She visited the mosque 23 times

32:49.793 --> 32:52.028
in the month prior to the bombing.

32:55.099 --> 32:57.100
And how many of those times

32:57.134 --> 32:59.936
did she carry a bag big enough
to hold a three-ring binder?

33:02.172 --> 33:04.107
Only once.

33:04.141 --> 33:05.274
And what day was that?

33:07.845 --> 33:10.913
September 11, 2011.

33:10.948 --> 33:12.915
The day of the bombing.

33:12.950 --> 33:14.250
We need to find that bag.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.585
Yes, we do.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.954
Let's start at Kadisha's house.

33:40.010 --> 33:42.545
This wasn't a hate crime.

33:43.881 --> 33:45.281
It was a love crime.

33:47.861 --> 33:49.650
And now we have to prove it.

33:57.363 --> 33:58.941
_

33:59.475 --> 34:01.409
You can tell she carried
a bomb in that bag?

34:01.443 --> 34:03.496
The C-4 explosive was in a binder.

34:03.521 --> 34:05.156
It probably didn't even make
direct contact.

34:05.181 --> 34:06.614
Probably why she didn't bother
getting rid of it.

34:06.649 --> 34:10.385
Even in solid form, C-4 molecules
still disperse into the air.

34:10.418 --> 34:12.754
That's why dogs can smell it.

34:12.788 --> 34:13.974
It can't be washed away.

34:13.998 --> 34:16.056
It sticks to stuff on a molecular level.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.889
She carried the bomb in here.

34:23.915 --> 34:26.501
Landon's innocent. Kadisha's guilty.

34:26.534 --> 34:27.635
We got to let him out.

34:30.005 --> 34:32.172
CTU will be on him 24/7.

34:32.208 --> 34:33.608
I hope that's enough.

34:33.641 --> 34:35.476
Of course.

34:43.735 --> 34:45.813
The imam's wife?

34:46.155 --> 34:48.790
She discovered her husband
was having several affairs.

34:48.824 --> 34:50.792
Did some research, found your blog,

34:50.826 --> 34:52.928
followed your instructions
the best that she could.

34:52.962 --> 34:55.597
She wasn't trying to frame you.

34:55.630 --> 34:57.832
I think she felt guilty

34:57.867 --> 35:00.068
that an innocent man
was paying for her crime.

35:00.102 --> 35:02.570
Did she know the others would be there?

35:02.605 --> 35:05.974
No. He usually ate lunch alone
in the office.

35:06.008 --> 35:08.910
Damn.

35:08.945 --> 35:11.246
You're not a soldier anymore.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.315
You're right.

35:15.518 --> 35:18.453
But this war isn't just between armies.

35:18.487 --> 35:21.356
Killing innocent people
isn't the answer.

35:22.254 --> 35:25.260
Actually, it is.

35:26.637 --> 35:28.630
Our enemy understands this.

35:29.536 --> 35:31.833
It's time we realize it, too.

35:33.231 --> 35:34.817
That sounds like a threat.

35:36.716 --> 35:38.506
Just an observation.

35:40.373 --> 35:42.481
But thanks for the reminder.

35:42.506 --> 35:45.981
I'll be much more careful
about what I say or write in the future.

36:47.947 --> 36:50.428
Yeah? May I help you with something?

37:24.479 --> 37:27.048
So, about yesterday...

37:31.721 --> 37:33.297
Thanks.

37:34.220 --> 37:35.988
Sure.

38:09.147 --> 38:11.459
I just got a call from Sing Sing.

38:13.038 --> 38:15.339
Rodney Landon
assaulted another prisoner.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.265
Really?

38:17.853 --> 38:21.509
A rumor started
that Landon was getting out

38:21.534 --> 38:23.361
for snitching on other inmates.

38:24.306 --> 38:25.828
A skinhead attacked him.

38:25.853 --> 38:27.821
Landon stabbed the guy with a shiv.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.847
He committed a felony
on camera this time.

38:31.872 --> 38:34.394
He isn't getting out of prison
any time soon.

38:34.419 --> 38:36.315
Bad guy stays off the street.

38:36.883 --> 38:38.518
Sounds like a win to me.

38:38.908 --> 38:41.689
I wonder how that rumor started.

38:52.571 --> 38:54.169
Not a clue.

39:19.203 --> 39:21.804
Thank you for the other night.

39:24.187 --> 39:25.887
Turns out you didn't need my help.

39:27.303 --> 39:29.060
Do I want to know how that happened,

39:29.085 --> 39:30.350
catching the actual murderer

39:30.375 --> 39:32.741
without setting free
the would-be mass murderer?

39:32.766 --> 39:33.976
No.

39:38.125 --> 39:40.126
Come on in. Have a drink with me.

39:40.151 --> 39:42.486
No. Thanks.

39:44.761 --> 39:46.089
You were right.

39:46.124 --> 39:48.294
I shouldn't have taken the case.

39:49.114 --> 39:51.911
I don't know why
I do things like that, but I do.

39:54.032 --> 39:55.420
And I hurt people.

39:58.169 --> 40:02.673
And I'm sorry about a lot of things.

40:04.642 --> 40:06.266
Including Chicago.

40:12.252 --> 40:13.343
Thank you.

40:17.197 --> 40:18.497
The new Hayes Morrison.

40:20.333 --> 40:22.568
I'm still pretty fond of the old one.

40:50.202 --> 40:51.269
Ignore it.

40:57.008 --> 40:58.334
To be continued.

41:04.075 --> 41:05.521
Turn on the TV.

41:05.946 --> 41:07.443
Now.

41:08.732 --> 41:10.035
It's a breaking scandal.

41:10.060 --> 41:12.209
You'll see in the
security-camera footage

41:12.234 --> 41:14.050
former First Daughter Hayes Morrison

41:14.075 --> 41:15.846
conferring with her longtime friend

41:15.871 --> 41:17.695
District Attorney Conner Wallace.

41:17.730 --> 41:19.454
Inside sources have told me

41:19.479 --> 41:21.666
that Wallace let Morrison off the hook

41:21.700 --> 41:24.168
after she was picked up
with cocaine in her purse.

41:24.203 --> 41:27.171
Rather than charging the former
First Daughter with possession,

41:27.206 --> 41:28.813
Wallace rewarded her

41:28.838 --> 41:31.167
with a sweetheart deal to run the CIU.
