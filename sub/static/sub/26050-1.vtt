01:18.579 --> 01:21.146
You should've stayed
in New York.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.638
[man] Hey, girls, I'm home!

01:46.740 --> 01:49.908
Mm, in the kitchen.
Dinner's almost ready.

01:50.010 --> 01:53.479
Zoe, I asked you to set
the table ten minutes ago.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.148
Yeah. And you saw
I was doing homework.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.150
I've thought that takes
precedent over

01:58.252 --> 01:59.585
setting a table.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.620
-[Sabrina] Precedence.
-Hey, hey, hey,

02:01.722 --> 02:03.322
Come on, you two.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.192
Ahh! Smells good.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.094
Me or the food?

02:09.196 --> 02:11.964
[chuckles] Shouldn't have waited
for me, honey.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.666
You know I'm leaving
for Paris tonight.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.202
You didn't say anything
about leaving yesterday.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.338
Oh, it can't already be
that time.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.507
Do we have to do this
every time?

02:21.609 --> 02:23.342
It's like clockwork, okay?

02:23.444 --> 02:24.776
This new development means

02:24.879 --> 02:26.311
I have to be in Paris
every other month.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.547
I know, I know, it just...

02:28.649 --> 02:29.615
snuck up on me, I guess.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.150
[sighs]

02:31.252 --> 02:33.218
[Zoe] You're leaving?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.354
What about my game?

02:35.456 --> 02:37.156
I'm playing Washington Central
this week,

02:37.258 --> 02:39.958
and if we beat them, we advance
to the quarter-finals.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.395
You didn't tell me
Zoe had a basketball game.

02:43.497 --> 02:47.032
Zoe has a basketball game
every Friday night.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.001
And practice five times a week,

02:49.103 --> 02:51.036
and violin lessons every Sunday.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.738
Everything is on the calendar.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.873
Between both your schedules
and my new clients,

02:54.975 --> 02:56.542
I can barely
keep it all straight.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.644
Sounds like
a pretty important game to me.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.646
[laughs]
Well, I'm sorry.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.080
I am doing my best here.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.516
[scoffs] It's fine, honey.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.552
Just make sure you send me
the highlights, okay?

03:06.654 --> 03:10.689
You know,
or take me with you?

03:10.791 --> 03:12.591
Pretty please?

03:14.295 --> 03:15.727
[whispers] Next time.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.902
Oh, I forgot to ask.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.272
I got an alert that
someone spent $500

03:27.374 --> 03:30.275
at a store called
La Femme Boutique.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.444
Well, Zoe said it wasn't her,
which means our card information

03:32.546 --> 03:33.845
must have been stolen.

03:33.948 --> 03:35.547
Unless it was you.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.516
No, I've never heard of it.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.850
I'll give 'em a call tomorrow
and make sure

03:38.953 --> 03:40.252
they remove the charge.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.720
Oh, you'll be travelling.
I can do that.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.022
It's okay, honey.
I got it.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.757
You got a lot on your plate
right now.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.292
What?

03:47.394 --> 03:50.195
Look, I've just been thinking,
you know...

03:50.297 --> 03:54.099
maybe you ought to drop
some of your accounting clients.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.568
Where is that coming from?

03:56.670 --> 03:59.304
Well, you just seem
a little overwhelmed.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.274
Because I didn't remember
you were leaving?

04:02.376 --> 04:04.376
[sighs] Look,
you've just come through

04:04.478 --> 04:06.712
a really difficult experience.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.383
[scoffs] Why would you
bring up that again?

04:11.485 --> 04:12.784
Huh?

04:12.886 --> 04:14.586
I've been through counselling,
I've--

04:14.688 --> 04:16.822
Because last year
was a really tough year.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.224
I took every dose
of my medication.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.660
You didn't just go through
a miscarriage, honey,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.962
you almost died.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.230
I'm fine.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.067
I actually feel great.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.302
Okay?

04:30.404 --> 04:32.671
And I love my work.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.439
You love being an accountant?

04:34.541 --> 04:35.741
I actually do.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.242
Numbers, I get.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.144
Teenage girls, not so much.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.646
[cell phone dings]

04:42.449 --> 04:44.783
Who's that?

04:44.885 --> 04:47.486
Oh, it's just
my car confirmation.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.823
We're not gonna finish
this conversation?

04:51.925 --> 04:54.092
Yeah, I can't miss this flight.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.297
Let's talk about this
on the phone in the morning.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.198
Oh, okay.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.834
Well, have a safe flight.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.211
Hey.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.014
Yeah, of course.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.349
I miss you, too, honey.

05:19.253 --> 05:20.952
Oh, your watch!

05:21.055 --> 05:22.387
Fletcher...

05:24.892 --> 05:26.525
[Fletcher] Yeah, well,
I'm gonna go to the office first

05:26.627 --> 05:28.960
and then I'll see you
after that.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.128
Okay.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.364
[chuckles] Okay.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.899
Sure, no problem.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.236

06:11.805 --> 06:14.172
What the heck? Paris?

[dramatic music]

06:42.136 --> 06:43.301
<i> Merci.</i>

06:44.538 --> 06:46.138
[Bridgette] Fletcher?

06:46.240 --> 06:47.873
[chuckles]

06:47.975 --> 06:49.307
[laughs]

06:50.844 --> 06:52.544
[Fletcher grunts]

06:54.248 --> 06:56.415
Mwah! I didn't expect to see you
until tonight.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.383
Oh, I couldn't wait.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.656
I rode in with papa,

07:04.758 --> 07:08.560
so I could see you before
he whisks you away for work.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.195
No rest for the wicked, huh?

07:15.135 --> 07:17.169
I'm so glad you're home.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.682
-Why can't I go too?
-Oh, we've been over this.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.684
You have school
and your basketball tournament.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.952
Are you really gonna miss that?

07:34.054 --> 07:37.355
-This is bull.....
-Language, Zoe!

07:37.458 --> 07:39.825
So, directly after practice,

07:39.927 --> 07:42.294
you go home with Taylor, okay?

07:42.396 --> 07:44.196
Why are you going, anyway?

07:45.699 --> 07:46.998
Does dad even know
you're coming?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.333
Your father and I are working

07:48.435 --> 07:50.368
through something at the moment.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.437
What does that even mean?

07:54.475 --> 07:57.609
-Mom!
-This family is my life.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.612
It means I'm doing this
for us, Zoe.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.849
Way to be cryptic.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.621
Just take that one.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.389
Looks better on you.

08:15.429 --> 08:16.595
Thank you.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.764
[instrumental music]

08:32.646 --> 08:34.646
Well, we're still on target

08:34.748 --> 08:36.515
for 2019 unveiling.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.849
Of course, that's all

08:37.951 --> 08:39.251
the shareholders
are concerned about.

08:39.353 --> 08:40.852
[cell phone ringing]

08:40.954 --> 08:42.487
Do you think I care about

08:42.589 --> 08:45.056
your shareholders?

08:45.158 --> 08:47.592
[scoffs]
Well-well, you should care.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.061
This expansion into
the European Union

08:50.163 --> 08:52.330
could lead to
new and emerging territories

08:52.432 --> 08:53.465
all around the world.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.768
[sighs] Let's close this deal.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.739
Big ground...

09:00.841 --> 09:02.908
and then you can move on

09:03.010 --> 09:05.644
to world domination.

09:08.515 --> 09:11.116
The deal is all but closed.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.285
I just need reassurance
that you'll be able

09:13.387 --> 09:16.121
to come up with your end
of the bargain.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.623
Your local influence.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.793
That's the only way
this deal works.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.030
But, in success...

09:25.132 --> 09:26.464
To success, then.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.002
[glasses clink]

09:36.076 --> 09:38.443
Oh, nice.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.780
And don't worry.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.648
You're family now.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.384
I never let family down.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.092
Hey, honey. You're up late.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.660
You having trouble sleeping?

10:28.762 --> 10:31.129
Actually, I'm right on time.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.698
I'm in Paris.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.200
What?

10:35.302 --> 10:36.434
What are you talking about?

10:36.536 --> 10:38.503
I decided to surprise you.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.606
You're in Paris?

10:41.708 --> 10:44.643
Yes. But, I'm on my way
to the city now.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.312
Well, ....damnit, Sabrina.
Why didn't you tell me?

10:47.414 --> 10:50.348
[Sabrina]<i> Well, that defeats</i>
<i> the purpose of a surprise.</i>

10:50.450 --> 10:52.784
You couldn't have picked
a worse time, honey.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.487
What hotel are you staying at?
I'll have the cab take me there.

10:55.589 --> 10:57.455
Can you call and let them know
I'm staying with you?

10:57.557 --> 10:58.857
[sighs]

11:02.663 --> 11:04.629
Uhh, sure, yeah.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.532
I'll, uh, text you the details.
Um...

11:07.634 --> 11:08.967
[Fletcher]<i> I have to go, honey,</i>
<i> someone's just jumped</i>

11:09.069 --> 11:10.869
<i> into my office, okay?</i>

11:13.473 --> 11:15.540
Did you just hang up on me?

11:15.642 --> 11:17.342
-Diane?
-Yes?

11:17.444 --> 11:19.844
Uh, I need you to book a hotel
room for me immediately, please.

11:19.946 --> 11:23.415
-Okay. What city?
-Uh, here, in Paris.

11:23.517 --> 11:27.485
Um, checking in now, and through
to the end of the week.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.487
-For yourself?
-[sighs]

11:29.589 --> 11:31.322
Put it in my name,
but it's for a friend of mine.

11:31.425 --> 11:32.357
She's just arrived
from New York.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.658
Of course.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.893
And can you reschedule
my meetings for

11:34.995 --> 11:36.494
the rest of the afternoon,
please?

11:36.596 --> 11:38.029
-Got it.
-Okay.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.564
[sighs]

11:52.479 --> 11:53.578
[door opens]

11:53.680 --> 11:55.280
You're here!

11:56.650 --> 11:58.917
You're here!

12:01.521 --> 12:03.688
Now is not a good time, Sabrina.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.758
Well, it might not be
a good time,

12:06.860 --> 12:08.259
but it's important
that I'm here.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.029
[sighs] Yeah,
but what about Zoe?

12:11.131 --> 12:13.398
[scoffs] I mean,
who's watching her?

12:13.500 --> 12:14.933
Now we're both missing
her big game.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.268
I've figured it all out, Fletch.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.737
She's staying with Taylor.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.305
And I already spoke
to her mother Marion.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.874
She's even promised
to video the game for us.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.743
I've never liked Taylor.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.946
I-I think her and her mother
are bad influence on Zoe.

12:28.048 --> 12:31.149
[scoffs] Have you seen the way
she lets Taylor dress?

12:33.019 --> 12:35.386
Do you not want me here?

12:35.489 --> 12:37.388
No, no.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.457
No, it's-it's not that
I don't want you here,

12:39.559 --> 12:42.127
it's just...

12:42.229 --> 12:43.394
It's unexpected.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.566
Oh, you haven't unpacked yet?

12:48.668 --> 12:52.337
No, I-I haven't really left
the office since I got here.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.906
-Oh.
-[sighs]

12:55.008 --> 12:57.008
I have to get back to work.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.343
Oh, wait.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.946
Before you go, let's call Zoe.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.414
I said I would
when we were together.

13:03.517 --> 13:05.083
Yeah, but it's-it's a bit early,
isn't it?

13:05.185 --> 13:07.385
Yeah, she's gotta get up
for school, anyway.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.887
Come on.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.325
[tablet ringing]

13:16.396 --> 13:19.197
Hi, honey!

13:19.299 --> 13:21.766
<i> Do you have any idea</i>
<i> how early it is?</i>

13:21.868 --> 13:23.334
I miss you, honey.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.603
<i> Miss you too, Dad.</i>

13:25.705 --> 13:29.641
<i> So, what are you guys</i>
<i> doing today?</i>

13:29.743 --> 13:32.043
Well, um, I'm gonna head back
to the office

13:32.145 --> 13:35.513
and I think your mom's
probably gonna pass out,

13:35.615 --> 13:37.649
so it's gonna be an early night

13:37.751 --> 13:39.951
for her and some room service.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.387
I thought we could go
for a nice dinner.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.289
[Zoe]<i> You're pathetic, Dad.</i>

13:44.391 --> 13:45.623
<i> Take your wife out.</i>

13:45.725 --> 13:47.192
Yeah, Dad.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.527
It's my first night
in the city of lights.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.995
Plus, I gotta stay up, right,

13:51.097 --> 13:52.397
or I'll never get over
this jet lag.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.867
Okay, okay. I know when
I'm being ganged up on.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.335
A nice dinner out it is.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.371
Uh, I'll have Diane book
somewhere fancy.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.740
-[Zoe]<i> Ooh, fancy pants.</i>
-[chuckles]

14:02.843 --> 14:04.976
[Sabrina] I love you, Zoe-bear.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.978
Text me
if you need anything, okay?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.480
-[Zoe]<i> Okay. Bye.</i>
-Bye. Love you, honey.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.015
Bye-bye!

14:15.622 --> 14:17.388

-Who's Diane?

14:17.490 --> 14:19.123
My assistant.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.595
Okay! Gotta run.

[instrumental music]

14:26.600 --> 14:27.665
[door opens]

14:35.408 --> 14:38.476
So, what's happening
with all your clients, then?

14:38.578 --> 14:39.777
They all know how to reach me

14:39.880 --> 14:41.746
if there's a sudden
tax emergency.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.916
It's a bit irresponsible,
isn't it,

14:45.018 --> 14:47.752
to abandon your clients
so last minute?

14:47.854 --> 14:49.487
Seriously?

14:49.589 --> 14:52.257
It's not even tax season yet.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.759
Weren't you telling me
to drop some clients, anyway?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.864
[indistinct chatter]

14:59.966 --> 15:02.200
You know what I was thinking?

15:02.302 --> 15:06.037
Why don't you get the train
to London tomorrow?

15:06.139 --> 15:08.373
You-you always wanted to visit
the Globe Theater.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.441
I'm here to see you, though.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.944
I wanna see where you work.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.380
How about I come to the office
tomorrow and meet your team?

15:15.482 --> 15:18.349
Look, I-I'm gonna be stuck
in meetings all day.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.386
I am not really gonna have time
to walk you around.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.554
I-I don't want you
wasting your days here.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.456
You'll have so much
more fun in London.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.058
More fun than Paris?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.626
You always used to talk
about wanting to see

15:28.728 --> 15:30.461
more theatre,
and London's perfect for that.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.363
[Sergey] Fletcher.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.098
Fancy seeing you here.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.337
A little late night for you.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.672
Well, you know what they say,

15:40.774 --> 15:42.907
"Business keeps one busy."

15:43.009 --> 15:46.177
I was just remarking
to some friends over there.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.447
Good company makes the time fly.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.317
Uh, Sergey, this is Sabrina.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.085
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.586
-Oh, an American?
-Hm.

15:55.689 --> 15:56.888
Yeah, Sabrina just came in

15:56.990 --> 15:58.523
from New York this morning.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.159
She's heading off
to London tomorrow.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.094
Didn't you just get in
from New York yourself?

16:03.196 --> 16:06.097
Uh, you know me,
always travelling.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.766
-So, what brings you to Paris?
-Oh, I'm just visiting--

16:08.868 --> 16:10.201
Yeah, li-like I was saying,

16:10.303 --> 16:11.736
Sabrina's actually heading off
to London

16:11.838 --> 16:13.404
to, to take in the theatre scene
tomorrow.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.273
-Oh! I'm so sorry.
-Oh, my Gosh.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.775
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh!

16:17.877 --> 16:20.044
That will be a nasty stain, hm?

16:20.146 --> 16:23.581
Excuse me,
I, I need to clean this up.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.928
[dramatic music]

16:39.299 --> 16:41.699
[water running]

16:53.546 --> 16:54.812
Who was that man?

16:54.914 --> 16:57.181
Business associate.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.050
Felt awfully awkward.

16:59.152 --> 17:03.154
I-I don't like mixing my
personal life with my business.

17:05.025 --> 17:08.426
He's really important
in commercial construction here.

17:08.528 --> 17:12.096
I can't screw this up, Sabrina.
I need to be on my game.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.433
I completely understand.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.002
But I'm not going to London.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.671
But I'll hire a car tomorrow

17:20.774 --> 17:22.106
to tour the city,

17:22.208 --> 17:23.775
and when you're done
with your meetings,

17:23.877 --> 17:25.843
we can meet each other after.

17:27.580 --> 17:31.282
All right. I-I'll get Diane
to arrange the car.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.189
You know, Fletch,

17:38.291 --> 17:40.892
I just want us
to be happy again.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.326
I know.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.128
Me, too, and I-I promise you,

17:44.230 --> 17:45.630
as soon as this deal is done,

17:45.732 --> 17:48.299
we'll spend some more time
together, I promise.

17:51.071 --> 17:54.072
We could go back to the hotel

17:54.174 --> 17:57.175
and make use
of the rest of this evening.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.576
Do you know what,
I-I'd love to do that,

17:58.678 --> 18:00.845
but since I took
the day off for you,

18:00.947 --> 18:02.346
I'm gonna have to get back
to the office.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.382
I'm sorry.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.917
[sighs]

18:06.019 --> 18:08.953
Well, like you said,

18:09.055 --> 18:10.888
"A lot more time soon."

18:14.494 --> 18:16.928
[intense music]

18:29.909 --> 18:31.309
[Fletcher] Okay.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.344
[telephone ringing]

18:33.446 --> 18:34.645
Yeah?

18:34.747 --> 18:36.781
Uh, I have to go.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.184
Sergey.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.752
[Sergey]<i> Good day to you.</i>

18:41.855 --> 18:43.087
What can I do for you?

18:43.189 --> 18:45.323
[Sergey]<i> How's your friend?</i>

18:45.425 --> 18:46.891
<i> Sabrina, is it?</i>

18:46.993 --> 18:48.826
She's on her way out.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.428
[Sergey]<i> Well,</i>
<i> if she's friend of yours,</i>

18:50.530 --> 18:52.263
<i> she's friend of mine.</i>

18:52.365 --> 18:55.233
<i>I'm sending Jacques to take her</i>
<i> to the station.</i>

18:55.335 --> 18:58.870
Well, that's not necessary.
She's not going to London now.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.072
[Sergey]<i> We like to take care</i>
<i> of our friends.</i>

19:01.174 --> 19:02.874
<i> You know that.</i>

19:02.976 --> 19:04.342
You shouldn't have done that.

[Sergey]<i> I don't like</i>

19:06.946 --> 19:08.346

19:11.684 --> 19:13.151
Well, you don't have to like it.

Listen, I've been thinking
about last night,

19:35.341 --> 19:38.142
and, you know what, I can get
some time off after all.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.949
I don't want you going
sightseeing by yourself, okay?

19:45.051 --> 19:47.285
I'll see you soon, honey. Bye.

Okay. I'll see you soon, then.

[gasps] I'm so sorry.
My plans have changed.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.608
This is an unexpected surprise.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.677
Is everything all right?

20:46.779 --> 20:50.114
The voicemail and text
seemed urgent.

20:50.216 --> 20:53.417
Yeah, everything's fine.

20:53.519 --> 20:56.354
[sighs] I just didn't want you
spending your day on your own.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.424
You look amazing.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.694
Y-you know what?

21:03.796 --> 21:04.962
What?

21:06.799 --> 21:09.166
I don't wanna leave
the hotel room at all now.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.168
Oh, really?

21:11.271 --> 21:14.105
And what do you have in mind,
my dear husband?

21:16.976 --> 21:20.978
[Fletcher] Same thing you had
on your mind last night.

21:26.286 --> 21:29.020
I missed you while you worked.

21:29.122 --> 21:32.757
Well, let's make up for that.

anything else, ma'am?

Oh, no, thank you. I'm full.

23:01.447 --> 23:03.347
But, would you mind giving me
some directions?

23:03.449 --> 23:05.683
I wanted to walk over
to my husband's office.

-Uh, where is his office?
-It's on Rue de Gramont.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.956

you can stop there.

to spice up your marriage.

on a much younger woman.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.509
We have, uh,
more conservative items

24:38.611 --> 24:40.778

28:31.777 --> 28:34.144
Well, I'm going to need
more funds

28:34.246 --> 28:36.580
for that kind of pressure.

28:36.682 --> 28:38.682
[exhales]
How much are you gonna need?

28:43.556 --> 28:46.323
-Fifty thousand.
-[laughs]

28:47.526 --> 28:49.026
[sighs]

28:49.128 --> 28:51.462
It's gonna be hard
to cover that.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.564
Isn't that your specialty?

28:56.869 --> 28:58.602
Oh...

28:58.704 --> 29:01.338
You should probably be
heading home.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.040
You've been away a month.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.709
Bridgette understands.

29:07.780 --> 29:12.382
There is a difference between
understanding and liking it.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.487
When are the trips
back to New York gonna stop?

29:16.589 --> 29:21.825
[sighs] Look, bringing Zoe over
isn't easy.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.161
Judges in America,
they don't like giving fathers

29:24.263 --> 29:26.230
full-time custody.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.899
It's been a battle.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.868
I know Bridgette
is looking forward

29:30.970 --> 29:33.003
to being in a real family.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.240
And you not leaving
every other month.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.010
Oh, I am, too.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.613
You'll have your 50K
by the end of the month.

29:42.715 --> 29:45.716
[dramatic music]

29:48.254 --> 29:49.887
[car engine starts]

29:58.264 --> 29:59.496
[groans]

30:03.536 --> 30:05.636
Just get coffee.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.839
[sighs]

30:11.477 --> 30:14.111
[sighs] Perfect, then.

30:28.761 --> 30:31.762
[instrumental music]

30:49.648 --> 30:52.049
[cutlery clinking]

31:17.176 --> 31:20.177
[dramatic music]

31:50.542 --> 31:52.175
Thank you.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.344
-How may I assist you?
-Yeah, I need a rental car.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.046
Of course, we can help you
arrange that.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.981
-What time will you require it?
-Now.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.816
-And can they bring it here?
-Of course.

31:59.919 --> 32:02.052
-Right. I'll wait here.
-Absolutely.

32:35.154 --> 32:38.155
[music continues]

33:08.187 --> 33:11.188
[music continues]

33:31.610 --> 33:33.543
[doorbell buzzing]

33:36.849 --> 33:38.015
[door opens]

33:39.351 --> 33:40.851
<i> Oui?</i>

33:41.720 --> 33:43.053
Diane?

33:43.155 --> 33:44.921
There's no Diane here.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.556
Oh.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.992
I'm sorry, I must be
at the wrong house.

33:49.094 --> 33:50.460
Not a problem.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.829
Uh, is, uh, Fletcher here?

33:55.534 --> 33:57.100
You just missed him.

33:57.202 --> 34:00.637
-Probably at the office by now.
-[baby crying]

34:00.739 --> 34:02.072
It's okay!

34:02.174 --> 34:03.907
Mama will be there in a second.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.843
[dramatic music]

34:06.945 --> 34:08.912
Can I help you with something?

34:10.549 --> 34:12.416
This can't be happening.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.518
-[exhales]
-Wait a minute.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.187
You're American?

34:18.157 --> 34:19.456
How do you know Fletcher?

34:23.529 --> 34:25.462
I know who you are.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.998
Stay away from us. And don't
ever come back here again!

34:28.100 --> 34:29.733
[engine starts]

34:35.874 --> 34:36.807
Fletcher?

34:38.210 --> 34:41.244
[Bridgette speaking
in foreign language]

34:45.117 --> 34:47.384
[sighs] ....damnit.

34:51.857 --> 34:54.858
[engine rumbling]

34:57.930 --> 34:59.096
[sighs]

35:01.100 --> 35:04.101
[breathing heavily]

35:06.939 --> 35:08.271
Breathe.

35:09.141 --> 35:10.674
Breathe.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.609
[sobbing] Breathe.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.731
[exhales]

35:37.169 --> 35:40.170
-[line ringing]
-Come on.

35:42.608 --> 35:43.907
Z-Zoe?

35:44.009 --> 35:46.343
Zoe, hi, it's dad.
I know it's early.

35:46.445 --> 35:49.246
-I'm sorry to wake you up.
-[Zoe]<i> Is everything okay, Dad?</i>

35:49.348 --> 35:51.081
Yeah, everything's fine.
Listen, um...

35:51.183 --> 35:53.683
I've got a little surprise
for you, honey.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.386
I'm gonna book you a ticket
to come to Paris today.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.388
[Zoe]<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i> Are you serious?</i>

35:58.490 --> 36:01.024
Yeah. Yeah, um, listen,
when you get in,

36:01.126 --> 36:02.926
I'm gonna be in a meeting,
so you're gonna go

36:03.028 --> 36:04.361
straight to my friend
Bridgette's house.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.029
She's gonna help you
get settled.

36:06.131 --> 36:07.697
[Zoe]<i> Where's mom gonna be?</i>

36:07.799 --> 36:09.699
Uh...

36:09.801 --> 36:11.935
Let's let that be a surprise.

36:13.038 --> 36:16.039
[intense music]

36:37.863 --> 36:39.596
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Sabrina] You bastard!

36:39.698 --> 36:41.164
Sabrina?

36:41.266 --> 36:43.633
-What's going on here?
-What are you doing here?

36:43.735 --> 36:45.702
-Come on. On your way out.
-Ow.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.974
Can you calm down, please?
What is wrong with you?

36:51.076 --> 36:52.676
I went to your house.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.545
Explain this!

37:00.219 --> 37:02.953
-It's not what you think.
-I met her, Fletcher.

37:03.055 --> 37:05.989
Your mistress.
Is that your child, too?

37:06.091 --> 37:09.192
Okay, you need to lower
your voice, Sabrina.

37:09.294 --> 37:11.261
Sorry. Is everything okay?
Should I call for someone?

37:11.363 --> 37:12.696
-Everything's fine, Diane.
-Okay.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.264
Oh, so you're Diane?

37:14.366 --> 37:16.466
Are you screwing her, too?

37:16.568 --> 37:19.769
[sighs] I'm sorry about that.
Just give me a minute, okay?

37:19.871 --> 37:20.870
Okay.

37:20.973 --> 37:22.772
All this time...

37:22.874 --> 37:25.442
All this time, you have been
playing house with someone else

37:25.544 --> 37:28.278
while I was recovering
from the loss of our child.

37:28.380 --> 37:31.181
-Is that what this is?
-Okay, I asked you once before.

37:31.283 --> 37:33.984
-You need to lower your voice.
-I will not!

37:34.086 --> 37:36.319
It's not what you think!

37:40.659 --> 37:43.460
Listen, honey,
I-I love you, and Zoe.

37:43.562 --> 37:46.663
I would never do anything
to hurt you two.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.866
Then how would you explain
your name on the envelope?

37:49.968 --> 37:52.702
That means you live there!

37:52.804 --> 37:56.006
Your house, that woman.

37:56.108 --> 38:00.543
[sighs] Look, right now
isn't the time or the place.

38:00.646 --> 38:04.014
[scoffs]
It's never the time.

38:04.116 --> 38:06.016
You have been avoiding me
since I got here,

38:06.118 --> 38:07.984
and now I know why.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.886
L-look, we'll have
a conversation.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.988
Oh, so it's a whole
conversation?

38:12.090 --> 38:15.225
[gasps] You really think
I'm gonna give you the time

38:15.327 --> 38:17.327
to wiggle your way out
of this one, Fletcher?

38:17.429 --> 38:19.262
That's not what I meant!

38:19.364 --> 38:21.364
You can't just come in here
guns blazing,

38:21.466 --> 38:23.166
screaming at the top
of your lungs.

38:23.268 --> 38:24.934
I work here!

38:25.037 --> 38:28.271
Our entire financial well-being
rests on me doing my job here.

38:28.373 --> 38:30.573
It's always all about you.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.442
[sighs] Well, the moment
you earn enough

38:32.544 --> 38:33.910
from your handful
of clients than--

38:34.012 --> 38:37.247
Wow! I cannot believe
you just said that.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.548
[sighs]

38:38.650 --> 38:41.184
I left my career
to raise our daughter.

38:41.286 --> 38:43.019
We both made that decision,
and now

38:43.121 --> 38:47.057
I am constantly being
punished for it.

38:47.159 --> 38:49.693
Zoe hates me,
and you've got a mistress.

38:49.795 --> 38:51.928
-I don't have a mistress!
-[Sabrina] Oh!

38:52.030 --> 38:53.296
She knew your name, Fletcher.

38:53.398 --> 38:56.666
She said you just left
this morning.

38:56.768 --> 39:01.871
Listen, I will explain
everything to you tonight, okay?

39:01.973 --> 39:06.876
There is a very simple
explanation for all of this.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.411
We'll have a conversation
tonight, okay?

39:08.513 --> 39:09.746
I'm done with this.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.282
[dramatic music]

39:19.591 --> 39:22.125
[line ringing]

39:22.227 --> 39:23.460
[woman on phone]
<i> Euro Airways. May I help you?</i>

39:23.562 --> 39:24.928
Yeah,
I need to change my ticket.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.663
I need a flight
out of Paris now, tonight.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.666
My reservation number is
F-K-I-9-9-1.

39:29.768 --> 39:30.900
[woman]
<i>I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?</i>

39:31.002 --> 39:33.803
F-K-I-9-9-1!

39:33.905 --> 39:34.838
[woman]
<i> I'm showing that you bought</i>

39:34.940 --> 39:36.573
<i> one of our discount fares,</i>

39:36.675 --> 39:38.508
<i> so there will be some</i>
<i> substantial change fees.</i>

39:38.610 --> 39:40.143
[sighs] Well...
Fine. I don't care.

39:40.245 --> 39:42.979
Whatever you have that gets me
out of here tonight.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.181
[woman]<i> I'm sorry, ma'am, but</i>
<i>we only have two direct flights</i>

39:45.283 --> 39:47.083
<i> leaving tonight, and both are</i>
<i> showing as sold out.</i>

39:47.185 --> 39:49.786
<i> I can always put you</i>
<i> on the stand-by list.</i>

39:49.888 --> 39:51.921
Sure. Yeah.
Do that, then I'll wait.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.957
[woman]<i> I do have to warn you</i>
<i> that there are at least</i>

39:54.059 --> 39:55.825
<i> twenty people ahead of you</i>
<i> on that list.</i>

39:55.927 --> 39:58.328
<i> So, chances are, you'd spend</i>
<i> the night in the airport.</i>

39:58.430 --> 39:59.596
<i> I can try to get you out</i>
<i> tomorrow.</i>

39:59.698 --> 40:01.698
<i>Should I look at those options?</i>

40:05.103 --> 40:06.703
<i> Ma'am?</i>

40:07.973 --> 40:09.305
<i> Ma'am, are you there?</i>

40:09.408 --> 40:11.541
[dramatic music]

40:11.643 --> 40:13.042
[woman on phone]<i> Hello?</i>

40:15.247 --> 40:16.413
<i> Ma'am?</i>

40:17.883 --> 40:20.350
<i> Are you there?</i>
<i> Hello? Hello?</i>

40:20.452 --> 40:21.684
[car engine starts]

40:29.261 --> 40:31.694
Excuse me, Sabrina?

40:34.399 --> 40:37.367
You look like you could use
a drink.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.704
[Fletcher]
Well, this is unexpected.

40:41.807 --> 40:44.340
I'm troubled, Fletcher.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.976
There's nothing to be
troubled about, Sergey.

40:47.078 --> 40:48.912
I heard there was
an American visitor

40:49.014 --> 40:51.214
at the house this morning.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.386
That's a personal matter.

40:56.488 --> 40:59.522
You forget there is no line
between personal and business

40:59.624 --> 41:01.224
between us now.

41:01.326 --> 41:03.793
And you forget that I have taken
your organization

41:03.895 --> 41:06.996
to another level with this deal.

41:07.098 --> 41:11.301
[sighs] We're partners in
more ways than one now, Sergey.

41:11.403 --> 41:12.902
Partners take care
of each other.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.471
And partner doesn't do things

41:14.573 --> 41:16.573
that upset other one's daughter.

41:20.345 --> 41:22.512
I really don't know
how to put this, but--

41:22.614 --> 41:23.880
He's cheating on me. I know.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.484
I think I always suspected.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.955
The longer he's here,
the more distant he's grown.

41:33.758 --> 41:35.558
But I came here to fight
for my family.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.662
It's funny, I thought he was
cheating on me with you.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.900
I'm sorry I accused you earlier.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.770
-I was so angry.
-Wait...

41:49.174 --> 41:51.074
You're not divorced?

41:51.176 --> 41:54.043
What, no. I'm his wife.

41:54.145 --> 41:56.980
But he's married to Bridgette.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.684
I'm trying to handle this
in my own way.

42:01.786 --> 42:03.152
I was going to help you
with that.

42:03.255 --> 42:05.488
Take care of it,
before you intervened.

42:08.493 --> 42:10.360
I'm not gonna let you kill her.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.697
Everything has changed,
Fletcher. Everything.

42:16.835 --> 42:19.536
How do you think Bridgette will
react when she finds out

42:19.638 --> 42:22.372
that your divorce
isn't finalized?

42:23.808 --> 42:25.975
If I'd have known that...

42:37.722 --> 42:39.222
I know it's not ideal.

42:39.324 --> 42:41.758
My marriage has been over
for a very long time.

42:41.860 --> 42:43.326
Does she know that?

42:43.428 --> 42:46.095
You two seemed awfully cozy
at dinner.

42:46.197 --> 42:47.664
Listen, Sabrina, she...

42:47.766 --> 42:50.633
She's not the most
mentally-stable person.

42:50.735 --> 42:54.637
Oh, for God's sake, she's
already shown up at your home.

42:54.739 --> 42:57.640
I won't have my daughter
tangled up in all this.

42:57.742 --> 43:00.643
Look, I'm trying to take care
of this, all right?

43:01.446 --> 43:03.079
When Zoe arrives,

43:03.181 --> 43:05.949
Sabrina will realize
that she has lost that battle.

43:06.051 --> 43:07.684
Ah, you better be right.

43:08.553 --> 43:10.853
It happened so quickly.

43:10.956 --> 43:13.289
In one minute, he's contracted
with the Novak Group

43:13.391 --> 43:15.091
with this new development.

43:15.193 --> 43:19.028
And the next, he's spending time
with Sergey and his daughter.

43:19.130 --> 43:22.265
Wait, who is Sergey
and the Novak Group?

43:22.367 --> 43:24.701
Sergey Novak runs
a construction company.

43:24.803 --> 43:26.703
He immigrated here years ago,

43:26.805 --> 43:30.006
and now,
he's very well connected.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.875
But what does he have to do
with Fletcher and this woman?

43:32.978 --> 43:35.311
Bridgette,
Fletcher's new wife,

43:35.413 --> 43:37.213
is Sergey's daughter.

43:37.315 --> 43:39.282
Fletcher's married
into this family.

43:39.384 --> 43:42.552
Listen, if I were you,

43:42.654 --> 43:45.622
I would leave now
and don't look back.

43:45.724 --> 43:48.057
You have a life back
in New York.

43:48.159 --> 43:49.993
Go back to that.

43:50.095 --> 43:52.261
File for divorce.

43:52.364 --> 43:54.797
Get as far away from him
as you can.

43:58.803 --> 43:59.802
No.

44:00.972 --> 44:02.939
No, I'm not running from this.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.441
I need to make him pay.

44:14.152 --> 44:15.485
I want you to clear this up

44:15.587 --> 44:17.020
before Bridgette finds out
the truth.

44:17.122 --> 44:18.855
That would kill her.

44:18.957 --> 44:22.158
I have no intention of making
this any harder on Bridgette.

44:23.662 --> 44:26.929
Well, let me be perfectly blunt,
Fletcher.

44:27.032 --> 44:29.265
My daughter's happiness

44:29.367 --> 44:31.534
is the only thing
that matters to me.

44:31.636 --> 44:35.705
Just like, I'm sure,
your daughter's happiness

44:35.807 --> 44:38.007
is paramount to you.

44:46.117 --> 44:48.851
You're meeting with Bernard
tonight, right?

44:48.953 --> 44:50.720
Yeah, we're going over
the final requirements

44:50.822 --> 44:52.989
for approval from the city.

44:53.091 --> 44:56.325
I'm glad Bernard finally
came around.

44:58.630 --> 45:01.030
Hmm? That's nice.

45:11.376 --> 45:15.211
Sergey's main operation is
extortion and money laundering.

45:15.313 --> 45:18.614
And if he and Fletcher
are doing that on this project,

45:18.717 --> 45:20.416
the proof of it would be
in the office,

45:20.518 --> 45:23.252
but I-I don't know
what I'm looking for yet.

45:23.354 --> 45:25.555
Okay, there's always
a money trail.

45:25.657 --> 45:27.423
Are they laundering money
through the real estate company?

45:27.525 --> 45:32.428
I don't know, but this project
was fast-tracked.

45:32.530 --> 45:33.996
It couldn't have
happened without

45:34.099 --> 45:36.132
lining some pockets, you know?

45:36.234 --> 45:38.568
Oh, they must be scheming
from this project

45:38.670 --> 45:39.902
to pay off city officials.

45:40.004 --> 45:41.504
Yes, I think so.

45:41.606 --> 45:43.272
If you could get your hands on
the project budget,

45:43.374 --> 45:44.974
we could see where
the money is going.

45:45.076 --> 45:46.743
That would implicate them?

45:46.845 --> 45:48.344
Not necessarily.

45:48.446 --> 45:51.147
That would just show his
questionable expenditures.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.116
Knowing Fletcher,
he'd be keeping track

45:53.218 --> 45:54.517
of any pay-offs separately.

45:54.619 --> 45:57.653
That's what we really need.

45:57.756 --> 45:59.188
I can find it.

45:59.290 --> 46:01.657
I can't ask you
to take any risks for me.

46:01.760 --> 46:05.094
No.
That would be for both of us.

46:06.731 --> 46:09.999
I'm going tonight after
the cleaning crew are gone.

46:10.101 --> 46:12.502
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

46:14.139 --> 46:16.939
Let's meet back here
at 3:00 a.m., okay?

46:17.041 --> 46:18.875
Will this place
still be open then?

46:18.977 --> 46:20.943
My darling, you're in Paris.

46:21.045 --> 46:22.945
It's an all-night city.

46:23.047 --> 46:25.148
-Okay.
-[sighs]

46:25.250 --> 46:27.049
We're really doing this?

46:28.386 --> 46:29.752
Yeah.

46:31.823 --> 46:33.022
We are.

46:33.691 --> 46:35.191
[glasses clink]

46:45.970 --> 46:47.203
Thanks.

46:54.112 --> 46:55.545
[exhales]

47:05.390 --> 47:08.224
I hope you like the room.

47:10.528 --> 47:11.794
Is my mom here?

47:13.231 --> 47:14.597
No, she's not.

47:19.337 --> 47:22.205
Are you hungry?

47:22.307 --> 47:24.440
Is my dad here?

47:24.542 --> 47:28.411
He had a business dinner
tonight.

47:28.513 --> 47:31.447
But he'll be back soon.

47:31.549 --> 47:34.784
I know he wanted to
talk to you.

47:34.886 --> 47:37.119

48:10.321 --> 48:11.487
[sighs]

48:14.559 --> 48:16.325
[Fletcher] Where's Zoe?

48:16.427 --> 48:17.827
She's sleeping.

48:19.664 --> 48:21.464
What'd you guys do tonight?

48:21.566 --> 48:25.401
I showed her the designs
for the pool house.

48:25.503 --> 48:27.436
She'll love the pool
in the summer.

48:27.538 --> 48:29.639
[chuckles]

48:29.741 --> 48:31.874
Uh, thanks for being here
when she arrived.

48:40.952 --> 48:42.652
[sighs]

48:42.754 --> 48:44.720
Am I gonna get it from you, too?

48:46.224 --> 48:50.426
That was your first wife,
wasn't it?

48:52.196 --> 48:53.996
I'm taking care of it.

48:54.098 --> 48:57.633
You promised me that your past
wouldn't affect us here.

48:57.735 --> 49:02.038
Well, it affected me
this morning.

49:02.140 --> 49:04.206
She came to our house.

49:04.309 --> 49:06.309
I said I'm handling it.

49:06.411 --> 49:08.611
If this is you handling it,

49:08.713 --> 49:10.780
you're failing miserably.

49:10.882 --> 49:13.115
[inhales]
Okay, that's enough, Bridgette.

49:13.217 --> 49:15.418
Why did she come here?

49:15.520 --> 49:21.023
Look, I underestimated
how unstable she is.

49:21.125 --> 49:23.059
Her coming to Paris
made me realize

49:23.161 --> 49:25.361
how dangerous she could be.

49:27.765 --> 49:30.599
Why do you think I brought
Zoe here last minute?

49:35.640 --> 49:38.674
Everything's gonna be all right,
okay?

49:38.776 --> 49:40.743
I'll take care of it.

49:42.747 --> 49:46.248
Let's get some sleep, huh?

50:33.765 --> 50:35.564
Did something happen?

50:35.666 --> 50:38.734
It's okay, I just, uh, left
something at the office.

50:40.138 --> 50:41.871
I won't be long.

50:43.374 --> 50:44.740

I'm gonna get back to New York.

1:08:44.821 --> 1:08:46.488
T-this is not happening.

1:08:46.590 --> 1:08:48.356
How could you kill someone?

1:08:48.458 --> 1:08:49.858
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:51.693
I saw you.
I was on the roof.

1:08:51.795 --> 1:08:54.195
You pushed Diane
off the building.

1:08:54.297 --> 1:08:55.697
Wait...

1:08:56.733 --> 1:08:58.566
That was Diane?

1:08:58.668 --> 1:09:02.370
You're a murderer,
a cold-blooded murderer.

1:09:02.472 --> 1:09:04.172
[sighs] This can't be happening.

1:09:04.274 --> 1:09:06.508
And so help me God,
you will never lay another hand

1:09:06.610 --> 1:09:08.810
on me or my daughter again.

1:09:11.581 --> 1:09:13.548
I thought it was you.

1:09:14.684 --> 1:09:16.217
What?

1:09:16.319 --> 1:09:19.187
-[Fletcher] Yeah.
-You, you thought it was me?

1:09:23.493 --> 1:09:24.826
But here you are.

1:09:24.928 --> 1:09:27.829
[scoffs] You see,

1:09:27.931 --> 1:09:31.933
I-I had a plan to divorce you.

1:09:32.035 --> 1:09:34.335
Your constant depressive state

1:09:34.437 --> 1:09:36.104
was my get-out-of-jail-free
card.

1:09:36.206 --> 1:09:38.540
You have no right
to bring that up anymore.

1:09:38.642 --> 1:09:40.108
Oh.

1:09:40.210 --> 1:09:42.677
And who could blame me
for wanting to get out?

1:09:42.779 --> 1:09:45.747
[laughs]
I... I-I'd ask for a divorce,

1:09:45.849 --> 1:09:48.650
y-you wouldn't have the stamina
to fight me.

1:09:49.886 --> 1:09:52.253
I found a new life here.

1:09:52.355 --> 1:09:54.589
But you just
had to come to Paris

1:09:54.691 --> 1:09:56.157
and snoop around.

1:09:58.562 --> 1:10:02.263
And... finding you on the roof,
it's like providence.

1:10:02.365 --> 1:10:04.532
-What?
-That was perfect.

1:10:05.669 --> 1:10:07.602
My wife...

1:10:07.704 --> 1:10:10.872
still suffering
from a deep depression

1:10:10.974 --> 1:10:14.642
throws herself off the top
of my office building.

1:10:14.744 --> 1:10:16.911
No messy divorce,
no custody battle...

1:10:17.013 --> 1:10:17.946
You're a monster.

1:10:18.048 --> 1:10:19.080
My, my marriage to,

1:10:19.182 --> 1:10:20.648
to Bridgette would still stand,

1:10:20.750 --> 1:10:22.483
Zoe would come
to live with us here.

1:10:22.586 --> 1:10:24.252
It might be a little difficult
for her first,

1:10:24.354 --> 1:10:25.553
but she'd get used to it.

1:10:25.655 --> 1:10:26.955
She'd never believe
that I'd take

1:10:27.057 --> 1:10:29.557
my own life.

1:10:29.659 --> 1:10:32.627
[Sabrina] I gave up everything
for this family.

1:10:35.165 --> 1:10:38.499
Well, you haven't exactly been a
stabilizing influence, have you?

1:10:38.602 --> 1:10:40.835
-Where is my daughter?
-[door opens]

1:10:40.937 --> 1:10:42.437
Mom.

1:10:42.539 --> 1:10:43.905
[Sabrina] Oh, baby!

1:10:45.775 --> 1:10:48.576
Okay. Mom, I need to breathe.

1:10:48.678 --> 1:10:51.145
-Are you all right?
-Of course, I'm all right.

1:10:51.248 --> 1:10:52.981
Just let your mom and I
finish our conversation, honey.

1:10:53.083 --> 1:10:54.515
Go back to your room.

1:10:54.618 --> 1:10:56.684
-I'll make some coffee.
-No, sweetie. No.

1:10:56.786 --> 1:10:58.586
It's okay, honey. Go.

1:10:58.688 --> 1:11:00.255
Mom...

1:11:00.357 --> 1:11:02.290
Zoe, go back to your room.

1:11:02.392 --> 1:11:05.727
Do not leave this room, Zoe.

1:11:05.829 --> 1:11:09.831
Seriously, I'm not gonna be
a pawn between you two.

1:11:14.938 --> 1:11:16.938
Okay, you want a divorce?

1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:18.940
I'll give you a divorce.

1:11:19.042 --> 1:11:23.011
But I swear, you will never
see Zoe ever again.

1:11:23.113 --> 1:11:25.446
And believe me when I say
I am gonna make you pay

1:11:25.548 --> 1:11:27.348
for what you have done.

1:11:29.452 --> 1:11:32.086
Don't you ever threaten me.

1:11:38.094 --> 1:11:39.694
It's not a threat.

1:11:53.243 --> 1:11:54.609
[chuckles]

1:11:56.146 --> 1:11:57.979
Okay.

1:11:58.081 --> 1:12:01.316
Now, we can do this
the easy way

1:12:01.418 --> 1:12:02.984
or the hard way.

1:12:04.587 --> 1:12:07.522
I'll concede
to a no-fault divorce.

1:12:07.624 --> 1:12:10.892
You go back to New York,
you can keep the apartment.

1:12:10.994 --> 1:12:13.194
You just have to guarantee
that there are no more copies

1:12:13.296 --> 1:12:14.629
of this floating around.

1:12:14.731 --> 1:12:16.731
And what about Zoe?

1:12:19.536 --> 1:12:21.936
Zoe stays here.

1:12:22.038 --> 1:12:23.538
Now, you're the crazy one
if you think

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:25.540
I'm leaving my daughter
with you and that bitch.

1:12:25.642 --> 1:12:26.708
[slams table]

1:12:28.144 --> 1:12:31.346
I have invested everything
in this life.

1:12:31.448 --> 1:12:33.414
I'm not gonna let you ruin it.

1:12:34.517 --> 1:12:36.417
[dramatic music]

1:12:36.519 --> 1:12:39.220
Okay, we're gonna go. We're
gonna go very quietly, okay?

1:12:39.322 --> 1:12:41.289
Where're you taking me?

1:12:41.391 --> 1:12:42.623
Get off me!

1:12:42.726 --> 1:12:45.493
Papa, she's here again.

1:12:45.595 --> 1:12:47.995
No. I need you here.

1:12:51.401 --> 1:12:53.201
[Zoe] What's going on?

1:12:53.303 --> 1:12:56.504
Marriage is, it's complicated.

1:12:57.874 --> 1:12:59.674
Sit down.

1:12:59.776 --> 1:13:02.176
I'll get you some breakfast?

1:13:15.658 --> 1:13:17.158
Your father...

1:13:18.595 --> 1:13:20.995
mentioned that your mom
wasn't feeling

1:13:21.097 --> 1:13:23.097
well for a while.

1:13:23.199 --> 1:13:26.033
My own mother suffered
from depression, too.

1:13:29.706 --> 1:13:32.240
What you need to remember is

1:13:32.342 --> 1:13:34.308
that your father will do
whatever it takes

1:13:34.411 --> 1:13:35.810
to protect you.

1:13:41.518 --> 1:13:43.918
Where are they going?

1:13:44.020 --> 1:13:45.686
[Bridgette] What's that,<i> chérie?</i>

1:13:45.789 --> 1:13:47.755
Why are they going out back?

1:13:49.893 --> 1:13:52.260
Hey! Get off!

1:13:52.362 --> 1:13:54.328
What are you doing?

1:13:54.431 --> 1:13:57.131
-Ow!
-Sit!

1:13:57.233 --> 1:13:59.634
Why? What's your plan here,
Fletcher?

1:13:59.736 --> 1:14:00.902
Stay put!

1:14:02.238 --> 1:14:04.172
You won't agree
to a no-fault divorce

1:14:04.274 --> 1:14:06.474
like a civilized person?

1:14:06.576 --> 1:14:08.543
This is my only option.

1:14:09.946 --> 1:14:12.213
[Sabrina]
What's your only option?

1:14:12.315 --> 1:14:14.682
Fletcher?

1:14:14.784 --> 1:14:16.551
[Fletcher] I have a new life
here, Sabrina.

1:14:16.653 --> 1:14:18.619
I'm not gonna let you
screw it up.

1:14:20.123 --> 1:14:22.557
Have you lost your mind?

1:14:22.659 --> 1:14:24.892
How will you explain this
to our daughter?

1:14:24.994 --> 1:14:27.528
[Fletcher] Oh. She'll believe
everything I tell her.

1:14:27.630 --> 1:14:31.232
Anyway, she's ready
for a fresh start away from you.

1:14:31.334 --> 1:14:34.135
She knows that I would never
hurt myself.

1:14:34.237 --> 1:14:36.204
You so sure about that?

1:14:37.774 --> 1:14:39.140
[screaming]

1:14:41.911 --> 1:14:43.010
She knows that I would never
leave her

1:14:43.112 --> 1:14:44.045
without saying goodbye.

1:14:44.147 --> 1:14:45.713
Well, that's just one more thing

1:14:45.815 --> 1:14:47.381
she can resent you for
when you take your own life.

1:14:47.484 --> 1:14:48.916
How could you do this to Zoe?

1:14:49.018 --> 1:14:50.651
I'm not doing this to Zoe.

1:14:50.753 --> 1:14:52.053
I'm doing this to you.

1:14:52.155 --> 1:14:53.521
She'll never forgive you.

1:14:53.623 --> 1:14:55.490
Oh, she wouldn't know
I had a hand in it.

1:14:55.592 --> 1:14:57.325
She'll think you did it
all yourself!

1:14:57.427 --> 1:14:58.426
Oh!

1:14:59.596 --> 1:15:01.429
Dad!

1:15:01.531 --> 1:15:03.030
What are you doing?

1:15:03.132 --> 1:15:05.700
....damnit, Zoe.
Go back into the house please.

1:15:05.802 --> 1:15:10.204
-[Zoe] Mom, what's going on?
-Zoe, go back into the house.

1:15:10.306 --> 1:15:11.906
[grunts]

1:15:12.008 --> 1:15:14.008
-[Zoe] Mom!
-[Sabrina] Call the police, Zoe.

1:15:14.110 --> 1:15:15.409
Oh, my God, Mom,
what did you do?

1:15:15.512 --> 1:15:16.978
Call the police!

1:15:20.950 --> 1:15:22.183
I don't know how.

1:15:25.054 --> 1:15:26.587
Dial 1-1-2.

1:15:26.689 --> 1:15:28.856
Tell them your father
had an accident, and he's hurt.

1:15:30.393 --> 1:15:32.193
[Zoe] It's ringing.

1:15:32.295 --> 1:15:33.361
Oh, my God.

1:15:33.463 --> 1:15:34.929
Oh, my God!

1:15:35.031 --> 1:15:36.464
Go outside and wait for them
to arrive.

1:15:36.566 --> 1:15:37.865
And when they get here,
bring them back here

1:15:37.967 --> 1:15:40.234
as quickly as you can, okay?

1:15:40.336 --> 1:15:41.936
Now, Zoe! Go!

1:15:43.506 --> 1:15:46.040
Your father and I have
some things to discuss.

1:15:46.142 --> 1:15:48.309
-[groaning]
-[Sabrina] Okay.

1:15:48.411 --> 1:15:50.111
Shall we try this again?

1:15:50.213 --> 1:15:53.381
You just, just leave. Please.

1:15:53.483 --> 1:15:57.818
Just... just take-take
whatever you want. You...

1:15:57.921 --> 1:15:59.921
You want Zo...
You want Zoe, take her.

1:16:00.023 --> 1:16:01.722
Just leave me and my life here,
please.

1:16:01.824 --> 1:16:03.891
[Sabrina]
You think it's that easy?

1:16:03.993 --> 1:16:05.493
You were gonna kill me
and tell Zoe

1:16:05.595 --> 1:16:07.161
that I took my own life.

1:16:08.765 --> 1:16:10.965
You were gonna carry on
with a new life

1:16:11.067 --> 1:16:13.901
and let that girl be a mother
to my daughter.

1:16:16.105 --> 1:16:19.440
I'm, I'm not, I'm not gonna
contest anything, okay?

1:16:19.542 --> 1:16:21.275
[sobbing] Just take everything.

1:16:21.377 --> 1:16:23.477
Take the apartment in New York.
Just take it all.

1:16:23.580 --> 1:16:26.447
Just leave me, my life here,
please!

1:16:26.549 --> 1:16:29.550
Oh, no. It's too late
for that, Fletcher.

1:16:32.589 --> 1:16:34.322
What do you mean?

1:16:34.424 --> 1:16:36.424
You have to answer
for Diane now.

1:16:36.526 --> 1:16:38.659
-No.
-Yes.

1:16:38.761 --> 1:16:40.127
-[Sabrina] Up.
-No.

1:16:40.229 --> 1:16:41.529
-[Sabrina] Get up!
-No.

1:16:41.631 --> 1:16:43.030
Get up!

1:16:44.033 --> 1:16:45.866
Outside. Now!

1:16:49.772 --> 1:16:51.305
[grunts]

1:16:51.407 --> 1:16:53.808
[intense music]

1:17:02.418 --> 1:17:05.019
Well, well, well.

1:17:05.121 --> 1:17:08.122
Nice family re-union
we have here.

1:17:10.460 --> 1:17:13.160
Zoe, are you okay?

1:17:14.330 --> 1:17:16.497
I haven't hurt the girl.

1:17:18.267 --> 1:17:20.301
And I don't think you hit him
hard enough

1:17:20.403 --> 1:17:22.269
if he can still walk.

1:17:26.776 --> 1:17:29.744
You've brought a pile of ....
down on my house.

1:17:29.846 --> 1:17:32.346
Sergey, you have to understand--

1:17:32.448 --> 1:17:33.881
I don't have to understand
anything else

1:17:33.983 --> 1:17:35.850
you try to tell me.

1:17:35.952 --> 1:17:37.284
We're partners, okay?

1:17:37.387 --> 1:17:39.754
We are in this together.

1:17:39.856 --> 1:17:41.022
Not anymore.

1:17:41.124 --> 1:17:42.356
Daddy...

1:17:42.458 --> 1:17:44.959
It's okay, baby.
Stay calm.

1:17:45.061 --> 1:17:47.028
You don't need to stay calm.

1:17:47.130 --> 1:17:49.930
You can get very upset now.

1:17:50.033 --> 1:17:51.632
God knows I am.

1:17:52.969 --> 1:17:56.804
Your father married
my only daughter

1:17:56.906 --> 1:17:59.240
while he was still married
to your mother!

1:17:59.342 --> 1:18:00.608
And she can have him.

1:18:00.710 --> 1:18:02.576
You keep quiet!

1:18:02.679 --> 1:18:04.111
Daddy, what's he talking about?

1:18:04.213 --> 1:18:05.646
It's okay, baby. Stay calm.

1:18:05.748 --> 1:18:08.716
Do you wanna fill her in?

1:18:08.818 --> 1:18:10.885
Your daddy has another family,
my darling.

1:18:10.987 --> 1:18:12.319
He's been living
parallel life here

1:18:12.422 --> 1:18:14.255
with Bridgette and Nathan.

1:18:14.357 --> 1:18:16.057
[stammers] I never meant for it
to get this far, honey.

1:18:16.159 --> 1:18:17.558
Can you stop talking?

1:18:17.660 --> 1:18:19.493
At some point,
he must have realized

1:18:19.595 --> 1:18:21.796
that he couldn't keep
both wives happy.

1:18:21.898 --> 1:18:24.765
So he decided to get rid
of one of them.

1:18:24.867 --> 1:18:27.134
I was never gonna leave you
behind. I promise.

1:18:27.236 --> 1:18:30.805
You didn't even bother
divorcing your first wife.

1:18:30.907 --> 1:18:33.340
You tried to kill her instead.

1:18:36.446 --> 1:18:37.511
Is that true?

1:18:39.682 --> 1:18:41.816
Don't say anything!

1:18:41.918 --> 1:18:44.085
He killed his assistant
last night

1:18:44.187 --> 1:18:46.387
thinking it was your mother.

1:18:49.125 --> 1:18:51.625
Oh, my God!
What is happening, Mom?

1:18:51.728 --> 1:18:53.160
Please, let her go.

1:18:53.262 --> 1:18:54.528
[Fletcher] Stop talking.

1:18:56.132 --> 1:18:58.733
I have no intention
of hurting her.

1:19:00.369 --> 1:19:01.802
Come on.
Come here, Zoe.

1:19:01.904 --> 1:19:03.537
-Come here.
-No!

1:19:07.210 --> 1:19:08.776
What happens now?

1:19:11.581 --> 1:19:14.415
You two should leave.

1:19:14.517 --> 1:19:17.785
Fletcher and I have
a lot to discuss.

1:19:26.763 --> 1:19:27.695
[grunts]

1:19:27.797 --> 1:19:28.996
Go back in the house, please.

1:19:29.098 --> 1:19:31.132
Go back in the house!

1:19:35.438 --> 1:19:36.804
This is all your fault!

1:19:36.906 --> 1:19:38.973
-Hey. Keep your ha..
-[grunts]

1:19:40.409 --> 1:19:42.910
-I'm gonna kill you!
-Please, stop it!

1:19:43.012 --> 1:19:44.712
-No!
-Hey, girl. Go away.

1:19:44.814 --> 1:19:46.147
Stay away.

1:19:46.249 --> 1:19:47.281
Stay away!

1:19:48.518 --> 1:19:49.550
[groaning]

1:19:49.652 --> 1:19:50.951
[grunts]

1:19:51.053 --> 1:19:52.419
Please.

1:19:56.592 --> 1:19:58.559
[screaming]

1:19:59.529 --> 1:20:01.095
-[body thuds]
-[gasps]

1:20:02.899 --> 1:20:03.998
[gasps]

1:20:20.783 --> 1:20:22.917
You bitch.

1:20:23.019 --> 1:20:24.685
-You killed him! You killed him!
-Calm down.

1:20:24.787 --> 1:20:25.953
-[Sergey] Calm down.
-[Bridgette] You killed him!

1:20:26.055 --> 1:20:28.255
[Sergey] Let them go.
Let them go.

1:20:28.357 --> 1:20:30.758
-Go.
-[sobbing]

1:20:30.860 --> 1:20:32.726
I'll handle this.

1:20:32.829 --> 1:20:34.795
[Sabrina] What about the police?

1:20:36.632 --> 1:20:39.200
Now is your one chance
to leave with your daughter.

1:20:41.204 --> 1:20:44.538
I think he's paid
for whatever else he has done.

1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:46.640
[dramatic music]

1:21:07.396 --> 1:21:10.331
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.

1:21:10.433 --> 1:21:11.565
No.

1:21:11.667 --> 1:21:13.834
Dad made his own choices.

1:21:15.771 --> 1:21:18.906
So did I. I'm sorry, Mom.

1:21:19.008 --> 1:21:22.076
All that matters now
is that we're together.

1:21:22.178 --> 1:21:24.745
You will always have me.

1:21:26.148 --> 1:21:28.015
We'll always have each other.

1:21:30.686 --> 1:21:32.086
Let's go home.

1:21:35.691 --> 1:21:38.692
