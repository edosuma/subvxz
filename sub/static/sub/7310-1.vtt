WEBVTT

00:00.961 --> 00:02.661
Previously on NCIS...

00:04.350 --> 00:05.750
Where the hell is DiNozzo?

00:05.850 --> 00:07.350
Find him now!

00:08.450 --> 00:09.650
I love you, Jeanne.

00:15.050 --> 00:17.150
You're very resourceful, Kort.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.350
I try.

00:18.450 --> 00:19.550
Trent Kort.

00:19.650 --> 00:22.050
He's on the FBI arms dealer watch list.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.450
- Believed to have recently join...
- La Grenouille.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.050
Your favorite international
arms dealer and mine.

00:27.150 --> 00:29.150
- This is good.
- And it's bad.

00:29.350 --> 00:30.600
I had to lie to Gibbs.

00:30.635 --> 00:31.815
You leave him to me.

00:31.850 --> 00:33.850
What were you doing out here alone?

00:33.950 --> 00:36.150
I can take care of myself, Jethro.

00:38.150 --> 00:40.150
- FBI being polygraphed?
- No.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.650
This net is being cast
strictly over NCIS.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.150
Who are they after, Tobias?

00:44.250 --> 00:45.215
Your boss.

00:45.250 --> 00:48.000
So you're the overzealous Fed who nearly

00:48.035 --> 00:50.542
mucked up 18 months of undercover work.

00:50.577 --> 00:53.050
I prefer to think of it as doing my job.

00:53.085 --> 00:55.050
Is she hot after all arms dealers

00:55.150 --> 00:57.550
or is there something about
this one in particular?

00:57.650 --> 00:59.950
How far are you willing
to go to get this guy, Jen?

01:00.050 --> 01:01.900
As far as you went to get Ari.

01:01.935 --> 01:03.715
I know what you're hiding from.

01:03.750 --> 01:06.650
It's not just me that I'm
worrying about hurting, Ziva.

01:09.250 --> 01:10.350
You okay?

01:10.450 --> 01:11.715
Who's this?

01:11.750 --> 01:14.350
Director's father,
Colonel Jasper Shepherd.

01:14.650 --> 01:17.200
He committed suicide 12 years ago.

01:17.235 --> 01:19.750
No, he stood where you stand...

01:19.850 --> 01:21.550
three weeks ago.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.450
I want to know whose
fingerprints are on these.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.717
Chain of evidence is not important.

01:26.752 --> 01:28.950
- You have children?
- Sadly, no.

01:29.050 --> 01:30.050
I have three.

01:30.550 --> 01:31.550
What's this?

01:32.750 --> 01:33.950
My secret.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.550
Welcome to the family.

01:38.450 --> 01:40.550
Professor DiNardo.

03:10.437 --> 03:12.637
My father knows everything about you.

03:13.137 --> 03:15.837
- Only what my daughter tells me.
- And I tell him everything.

03:17.737 --> 03:18.837
That's great.

03:19.137 --> 03:20.137
So...

03:21.237 --> 03:24.337
here we all are on our way to, um...

03:24.437 --> 03:26.237
Where exactly are we headed?

03:27.037 --> 03:28.637
I don't know. Breakfast?

03:29.737 --> 03:32.137
A chance for us to
get to know each other.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.537
I'm sure you've lots of questions.

03:35.437 --> 03:36.537
I know I do.

03:37.337 --> 03:39.137
My apartment first, Papa.

03:39.437 --> 03:42.237
You wouldn't believe the night
we've had. It was very frightening.

03:42.337 --> 03:45.637
Yes, your daughter is very
impressive with a scalpel, Mr. Benoit.

03:45.737 --> 03:46.937
Please, Rene.

03:48.137 --> 03:49.837
You never told me you could shoot.

03:49.937 --> 03:52.437
Well, I can't, clearly.

03:52.537 --> 03:54.437
- I missed.
- On purpose.

03:54.737 --> 03:56.537
There was a shooting at the hospital?

03:56.572 --> 03:58.537
It's a long story, Rene.

03:59.337 --> 04:00.837
We have all weekend.

04:01.037 --> 04:04.237
Well, it's really more of
Jeanne's long story than mine.

04:05.337 --> 04:07.802
There was this crazy young guy

04:07.837 --> 04:11.137
who tried to smuggle heroin into
the country and he got hit by a car.

04:11.237 --> 04:13.537
One of the bags in
his stomach burst, but

04:13.737 --> 04:16.337
we didn't know until it
was too late, and then...

04:20.337 --> 04:23.437
I forgot to sign the death
certificate to release the body.

04:23.937 --> 04:25.137
Sorry, Papa.

04:25.737 --> 04:27.737
Henri, back to the hospital.

04:27.837 --> 04:28.837
Yes, sir.

04:31.637 --> 04:33.737
Well, I guess breakfast
is gonna have to wait.

04:34.737 --> 04:36.737
And all those intriguing questions.

04:41.137 --> 04:42.737
What are you doing here?

04:42.937 --> 04:44.037
I asked first.

04:45.237 --> 04:48.237
Well, technically, Ziva, I think that
if we were to put that to the test,

04:48.272 --> 04:50.037
you'd find that it
was too close to call.

04:51.437 --> 04:53.237
But since my parents

04:53.437 --> 04:55.737
raised a gentleman and
yours raised a killer,

04:56.437 --> 04:58.337
I was defragging my computers.

04:59.337 --> 05:00.337
Liar.

05:02.537 --> 05:03.937
Have you heard from Tony?

05:04.337 --> 05:05.813
You came into the office on a Saturday

05:05.837 --> 05:07.637
morning because you're
worried about Tony?

05:07.672 --> 05:09.137
You have been here all night.

05:10.637 --> 05:12.437
Is that a question or a statement?

05:12.737 --> 05:13.737
Question.

05:13.937 --> 05:16.137
- Sounded more like a statement.
- Demands an answer.

05:16.837 --> 05:18.637
Yes, I was here all night.

05:19.337 --> 05:20.737
Fragging the computers.

05:20.937 --> 05:21.937
Defragging.

05:22.137 --> 05:23.613
You need to work on those inflections

05:23.637 --> 05:25.937
when you're asking a
question. For example,

05:27.137 --> 05:28.837
why are you worried about Tony?

05:30.437 --> 05:32.737
Well, he was supposed to
meet us at the bar last night.

05:32.772 --> 05:34.737
He did not arrive, did not call.

05:34.837 --> 05:37.537
He's not answering his home
phone or his cell phone.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.837
Do you have the number
to his second cell phone?

05:40.937 --> 05:43.037
- The one he uses for his private calls?
- Yes!

05:43.537 --> 05:44.537
No.

05:47.137 --> 05:48.637
Gibbs was here all night, too?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.137
Are we a team, McGee?

05:52.737 --> 05:53.737
Morning, Ziva.

05:53.837 --> 05:55.937
Nothing better to do
on a Saturday morning?

05:56.137 --> 05:57.937
Teams do not have secrets, Gibbs.

05:58.437 --> 06:01.337
And if you do not tell me what you
were both doing here last night...

06:04.537 --> 06:05.737
McGee knows he will...

06:07.337 --> 06:08.337
eventually.

06:15.037 --> 06:17.137
- Won't be long.
- I can come with you if you want.

06:17.172 --> 06:18.937
No need. He won't bite.

06:20.737 --> 06:21.737
Coffee?

06:22.537 --> 06:23.737
Coffee would be great.

06:24.137 --> 06:25.137
Good.

06:26.337 --> 06:28.437
While we wait you can tell me how...

06:28.737 --> 06:30.237
you stole my daughter's heart.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.137
I'll get it!

06:54.437 --> 06:55.437
I'll get it.

06:56.537 --> 06:57.502
Director.

06:57.537 --> 07:00.037
I'm sorry for keeping
you here all night, Abby.

07:00.072 --> 07:01.137
That's okay.

07:01.237 --> 07:04.737
It's not the first time I've woken
up on the floor. Not just this floor.

07:04.937 --> 07:07.937
Not that I make it a habit of
passing out on floors and not that

07:07.972 --> 07:10.837
this is a really comfortable
floor. If I had to...

07:11.437 --> 07:12.537
I'm awake now.

07:21.137 --> 07:22.137
Thanks, Abby.

07:22.237 --> 07:23.237
You can go now.

07:23.337 --> 07:24.537
Did we get a match?

07:27.537 --> 07:28.537
No.

07:33.037 --> 07:34.037
Poor guys.

07:34.437 --> 07:37.137
Humming away all night and for nothing.

07:38.937 --> 07:40.637
What search result?

07:45.137 --> 07:47.037
This is not good.

07:48.537 --> 07:50.437
Why would the CIA come
after the Director?

07:50.537 --> 07:51.537
You tell me.

07:52.337 --> 07:53.637
Protecting their asset.

07:54.037 --> 07:55.037
La Grenouille.

07:55.737 --> 07:56.837
Does the Director know?

07:56.872 --> 07:57.872
Know what?

08:00.137 --> 08:02.437
That it's Saturday and we're all

08:02.937 --> 08:05.437
here on our day off
because we love our jobs.

08:05.472 --> 08:07.837
Except for Tony who is missing.

08:07.937 --> 08:10.037
McGee, I want you to
triangulate a cell number.

08:10.137 --> 08:13.937
- Sure.
- 202-555-0177.

08:14.037 --> 08:15.437
DiNozzo in trouble?

08:15.837 --> 08:16.837
I knew it.

08:17.937 --> 08:20.137
The woman Tony has been seeing,

08:20.637 --> 08:21.937
Jeanne Benoit,

08:22.237 --> 08:23.737
is La Grenouille's daughter.

08:26.537 --> 08:27.837
He's been on assignment?

08:29.137 --> 08:30.137
You did

08:30.437 --> 08:32.437
plan to tell us at some point?

08:32.937 --> 08:35.037
If it led us to her father, yes.

08:35.236 --> 08:37.136
- Yeah, did it?
- I don't know.

08:37.236 --> 08:39.937
You want to tell us what
you do know, Director?

08:40.236 --> 08:43.937
Tony just contacted me
using his alias' cell.

08:44.037 --> 08:47.637
It was a prearranged signal
used only in emergency

08:47.672 --> 08:49.337
if he thought his cover had been blown.

08:49.372 --> 08:50.437
Triangulating.

08:52.937 --> 08:55.002
- Tony DiNardo.
- Cute.

08:55.037 --> 08:58.337
I want this fed to MTAC and
I want satellite coverage.

08:58.537 --> 08:59.537
On its way.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.537
Merci beaucoup.

09:11.837 --> 09:12.837
So,

09:13.937 --> 09:15.837
what did Jeanne tell you about me?

09:16.337 --> 09:17.537
Oh, everything.

09:18.237 --> 09:19.637
The world's greatest dad.

09:20.037 --> 09:23.437
Children want to believe the
best, huh, of their parents.

09:23.837 --> 09:26.837
I'm sure you believe your
father is a good man, hmm?

09:28.237 --> 09:29.237
He was.

09:30.037 --> 09:33.437
Still love has a way of blinding
us, no? Of the imperfections?

09:34.737 --> 09:35.837
It's still love.

09:36.137 --> 09:37.137
True.

09:38.037 --> 09:39.337
And we both love Jeanne.

09:39.437 --> 09:40.537
Yes, we do.

09:44.237 --> 09:46.337
Are you going to break
my daughter's heart?

09:48.437 --> 09:49.902
No, sir, not if I can help it.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.137
Sometimes we lie to the people we love

09:52.237 --> 09:54.737
in order to protect them.

09:55.437 --> 09:56.637
You've lied to Jeanne?

09:57.537 --> 09:58.537
Well, have you?

10:00.337 --> 10:01.337
Here she comes.

10:01.537 --> 10:02.502
Done!

10:02.537 --> 10:05.637
Now let's get out of here before
they remember something else.

10:05.737 --> 10:08.637
- I have to move my car because...
- They'll tow you for sure.

10:08.672 --> 10:10.037
They're murder around here.

10:10.072 --> 10:11.437
We wouldn't want that.

10:11.837 --> 10:13.137
Stay close.

10:14.037 --> 10:15.337
Wouldn't want to lose you.

10:15.837 --> 10:16.937
No chance of that.

10:21.237 --> 10:23.337
He's on 22nd Street North West,

10:23.372 --> 10:25.437
outside Monroe University Hospital.

10:25.737 --> 10:26.937
He's on the move.

10:27.337 --> 10:28.437
Must be in a car.

10:28.537 --> 10:30.537
How long until we get
satellite coverage?

10:30.572 --> 10:32.137
At least 15 minutes.

10:32.537 --> 10:35.702
Or we could patch into D.
C.'s traffic-cam system.

10:35.737 --> 10:37.937
See if we can locate him on
the traffic-cam management.

10:37.972 --> 10:38.972
Do it.

10:40.037 --> 10:42.137
- Anything?
- Still not answering.

10:42.237 --> 10:43.937
Shall I try his undercover cell phone?

10:44.137 --> 10:45.537
Put it on speaker.

10:51.937 --> 10:54.137
Hi. You've reached
Professor Tony DiNardo.

10:54.172 --> 10:56.337
Leave a message and I
will get back to you.

10:56.537 --> 10:57.537
I promise.

10:58.337 --> 11:02.137
His cover is teaching film
online at American University.

11:02.437 --> 11:03.837
Tony a teacher?

11:04.637 --> 11:06.437
No wonder he's been compromised.

11:06.472 --> 11:07.837
Whose bright idea was that?

11:08.337 --> 11:09.337
Mine.

11:11.437 --> 11:12.437
We're in.

11:12.537 --> 11:13.537
Bring it up.

11:17.137 --> 11:18.137
Got it.

11:18.837 --> 11:20.737
I'm relaying the cell phone signal.

11:22.637 --> 11:23.637
Tony's car.

11:30.437 --> 11:31.937
Tony DiNardo's car.

11:32.237 --> 11:33.437
How deep is this cover?

11:33.537 --> 11:35.137
Deep enough to withstand the sort of

11:35.237 --> 11:37.637
scrutiny La Grenouille
can bring to bear.

11:37.837 --> 11:38.937
You better hope so.

11:41.637 --> 11:42.837
West on M Street.

11:46.537 --> 11:48.337
No one else is in the car with him.

11:49.337 --> 11:51.637
He's turning north onto 29th Street.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.837
Traffic speed. No signs of duress.

11:54.737 --> 11:55.902
Cell phone's still off.

11:55.937 --> 11:57.637
No one seems to be tailing him.

11:57.737 --> 11:59.537
Maybe he's the one doing the tailing.

11:59.637 --> 12:00.937
Still on 29th.

12:05.537 --> 12:06.737
Oh, my God.

12:07.437 --> 12:08.437
Tony.

13:01.971 --> 13:02.971
McGee.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.367
McGee!

13:52.584 --> 13:53.584
Hey.

13:57.884 --> 13:59.984
That some sort of timer device?

14:01.784 --> 14:03.784
Ten bucks at most electrical stores.

14:04.184 --> 14:06.784
Probably activated when
the ignition turned on.

14:06.884 --> 14:08.884
Counts down however long you need it to.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.884
When it reaches zero...

14:15.184 --> 14:17.784
Shockwave would've killed
him before the fire.

14:19.284 --> 14:21.284
Death would've been instantaneous.

14:23.484 --> 14:26.584
Small mercies, my dear boy.

14:30.384 --> 14:31.484
Identification?

14:32.084 --> 14:34.784
General build, height,
weight are about right.

14:35.484 --> 14:36.684
Most of the

14:36.984 --> 14:40.284
epidermis and dermis on the
hands and fingers have been

14:40.384 --> 14:42.684
burned off, so no fingerprints.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.484
We'll need to get his

14:47.084 --> 14:50.284
dental records for
positive identification.

14:51.784 --> 14:54.384
And is there any chance
that it's not Tony?

14:56.584 --> 14:58.484
None that I can think of.

15:02.784 --> 15:04.284
She blames herself.

15:07.284 --> 15:08.284
Should she?

15:09.684 --> 15:11.284
Let me know when you're finished, Duck.

15:20.484 --> 15:21.984
You believe in miracles, Ziva?

15:22.584 --> 15:23.784
Not part of my traing.

15:24.084 --> 15:25.484
It might not be Tony.

15:40.684 --> 15:42.884
Tony is not dead, Gibbs.

15:43.184 --> 15:45.284
Not until Ducky says it's him.

15:45.484 --> 15:47.184
Until then, he's just...

15:47.384 --> 15:48.684
he's not here.

15:49.384 --> 15:51.884
And I don't care what the evidence says.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.984
Even if everything here belongs to Tony,

15:54.084 --> 15:57.149
it's still not him until Ducky
says that it's him. And don't

15:57.184 --> 15:59.984
try to tell me anything different
because I'm not gonna believe you.

16:02.784 --> 16:04.484
Tell me it's not him, Gibbs.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.784
Tell me it's not him.

16:12.584 --> 16:13.884
I wish I could, Ab.

16:16.984 --> 16:18.784
I need to be alone
right now with the gang.

16:18.819 --> 16:20.084
I've got work to do.

16:26.084 --> 16:27.084
Abby...

16:30.384 --> 16:31.784
How did these get here?

16:34.584 --> 16:38.284
Director Shepard swore me to secrecy
when she brought those in and asked

16:38.384 --> 16:40.584
me to run them for prints,
so I can't tell you.

16:44.284 --> 16:46.684
Any other secrets you can't tell me?

16:46.784 --> 16:48.484
No, just that one.

16:48.684 --> 16:51.984
Because when Director Shepard said
that there wasn't an AFIS match

16:52.084 --> 16:54.184
and then tried to hide
the results from me,

16:54.284 --> 16:57.984
she actually didn't swear me to
secrecy. So that is not a secret.

16:58.084 --> 16:59.284
Who was the match?

17:00.284 --> 17:01.284
Her father.

17:02.684 --> 17:03.784
Her father

17:03.984 --> 17:05.884
has been dead for 12 years, Abby.

17:05.919 --> 17:07.884
No, not according to AFIS.

17:11.483 --> 17:14.284
That is a ten-point match, Gibbs.

17:14.483 --> 17:15.784
These are new prints.

17:16.483 --> 17:18.983
There's no way Director
Shepard's father is dead.

17:19.584 --> 17:21.584
I buried my father, Jethro.

17:22.884 --> 17:24.384
I know he's not coming back.

17:25.284 --> 17:28.084
But someone is going
to great lengths trying

17:28.118 --> 17:30.184
to convince me he's alive.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.784
We've got a polygraph test Monday.

17:32.984 --> 17:35.084
- Routine.
- They're targeting someone.

17:35.284 --> 17:37.384
- Me?
- So I've been told.

17:38.084 --> 17:40.784
I've never failed a polygraph,
I'm not about to start.

17:41.884 --> 17:43.784
And if they ask you about your father?

17:44.584 --> 17:45.584
He's dead.

17:46.884 --> 17:49.684
Any doubt, any hesitation
will raise a red flag.

17:50.484 --> 17:52.984
- There is no doubt.
- I saw his fingerprints.

17:53.019 --> 17:54.084
My father's dead.

17:54.184 --> 17:57.184
Subject displayed emotional
instability suggesting

17:57.284 --> 18:00.484
delusional belief her father
isn't dead. Next question.

18:01.184 --> 18:03.684
We just put her on medical
leave or we fire her?

18:04.984 --> 18:06.884
Operation Lodestone. You know it?

18:06.984 --> 18:08.384
- Should I?
- Black op.

18:09.184 --> 18:11.784
Focused on weapons control
and arms proliferation.

18:11.819 --> 18:13.684
- Not one of ours.
- CIA.

18:13.984 --> 18:15.484
My father's job

18:15.684 --> 18:18.284
at the Pentagon was in
the field of arms control.

18:18.384 --> 18:21.884
He was under investigation for
accepting a bribe when he was killed.

18:21.984 --> 18:24.284
- Coroner said he took his own life.
- He was murdered.

18:24.319 --> 18:25.784
- Proof?
- None.

18:25.984 --> 18:27.449
But I know who's responsible.

18:27.484 --> 18:29.884
The same guy you sent
one of my agents after.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.184
One of my agents.

18:32.584 --> 18:34.884
A deep undercover operation that

18:34.919 --> 18:37.184
I ran on a need-to-know basis.

18:40.784 --> 18:41.784
And, Jethro...

18:42.984 --> 18:45.684
if you think I'm obsessed
with La Grenouille because of

18:45.884 --> 18:47.584
what happened to my father,

18:49.284 --> 18:50.284
you're wrong.

18:53.184 --> 18:55.484
You may want to skip that
polygraph test Monday.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.084
Must you keep doing that?

19:05.984 --> 19:07.584
Just checking something Gibbs said.

19:08.484 --> 19:10.584
Tony wouldn't have carried
it with him, you know?

19:11.084 --> 19:13.184
His shield and ID, not
if he was undercover.

19:14.584 --> 19:15.584
He would've

19:15.784 --> 19:18.584
stashed it in the car,
maybe under the seat.

19:19.184 --> 19:21.584
Just because we found his
ID doesn't mean it's Tony.

19:22.084 --> 19:23.084
His car,

19:23.484 --> 19:24.484
his ID,

19:24.984 --> 19:26.084
his weapon...

19:26.384 --> 19:27.684
both of his cell phones, McGee?

19:36.084 --> 19:38.684
What was it that Gibbs said
that you thought need checking?

19:39.084 --> 19:41.484
That he thought Tony
might be tailing someone.

19:46.284 --> 19:47.384
Stop it there.

19:48.084 --> 19:49.084
Take it back.

19:51.884 --> 19:52.849
The limousine.

19:52.884 --> 19:54.384
It was on the previous camera.

19:55.684 --> 19:57.084
It's on every camera.

19:57.184 --> 19:58.584
He was following the limousine.

19:59.584 --> 20:00.584
Where is Gibbs?

20:04.884 --> 20:05.984
Another shrapnel.

20:06.584 --> 20:07.884
Lower left lobe.

20:13.384 --> 20:14.984
Blood tests are back.

20:20.484 --> 20:21.584
What type?

20:21.684 --> 20:22.684
A - positive.

20:25.184 --> 20:26.184
And Tony's?

20:29.584 --> 20:30.584
A - positive.

20:35.384 --> 20:36.784
Yes, well...

20:38.584 --> 20:41.284
34 percent of the nation's population

20:41.319 --> 20:43.284
share the same blood group.

20:44.084 --> 20:46.384
So let's not go drawing any conclusions.

20:46.484 --> 20:50.084
We'll await the dental records
before making positive ID.

20:50.884 --> 20:52.384
In the meantime...

20:54.284 --> 20:55.284
The lungs.

20:56.084 --> 20:58.484
Penetrative shrapnel damage,

20:58.519 --> 21:00.884
middle and lower left lobes.

21:01.484 --> 21:05.284
Otherwise healthy tissue,
non-smoker, minimal scarring.

21:05.384 --> 21:06.784
Minimal scarring.

21:09.384 --> 21:10.684
Minimal scarring.

21:10.984 --> 21:12.684
I got that, Doctor.

21:13.084 --> 21:15.784
Yes, but... Mr. Palmer, how could he?

21:16.984 --> 21:18.584
How could he what, sir?

21:19.184 --> 21:21.484
Have minimal scarring

21:22.184 --> 21:23.884
in both lungs?

21:23.919 --> 21:25.584
Healthy living.

21:26.384 --> 21:27.984
Yersinia pestis.

21:28.184 --> 21:29.584
Y - pestis.

21:29.884 --> 21:31.184
The pneumonic plague?

21:31.384 --> 21:33.684
Yes, the plague, Mr. Palmer.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.884
This man has never had the plague.

21:39.384 --> 21:42.184
He's never had the plague.

21:42.284 --> 21:44.384
So he has never had the plague.

21:45.184 --> 21:47.684
He never had the damn plague!

21:50.484 --> 21:52.484
The limousine is leased
to a shell company.

21:52.684 --> 21:54.684
The parent company is EuroFreight.

21:54.719 --> 21:56.349
Head office is in Luxembourg.

21:56.384 --> 21:58.884
The principal behind the
company is Rene Benoit.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.484
Tony could've been
following La Grenouille.

22:02.484 --> 22:04.984
I'm sorry to differ,
Timothy, but he wasn't.

22:05.184 --> 22:08.984
Look, Tony contracted pneumonic plague,

22:09.019 --> 22:10.784
as I'm sure everyone can remember.

22:10.819 --> 22:11.849
Before my time.

22:11.884 --> 22:14.884
- He almost died.
- From severe pneumonia.

22:15.084 --> 22:18.784
As a result, his lungs would've
been extensively scarred.

22:18.884 --> 22:21.684
Unlike the almost pristine lung

22:21.784 --> 22:24.184
of the man currently in autopsy.

22:24.884 --> 22:28.284
The body on which I am
performing an autopsy

22:28.984 --> 22:30.684
is not Tony's.

22:32.884 --> 22:34.284
If it's not Tony...

22:35.384 --> 22:36.384
Then who is it?

22:36.484 --> 22:38.184
And where is DiNozzo?

22:46.541 --> 22:48.941
I want to know every
thing of this company.

22:49.241 --> 22:52.041
Banks, statement,
telephone, records personal.

22:52.076 --> 22:53.641
Hard drive's spinning up now.

22:53.741 --> 22:54.741
Everything, Tim.

22:54.941 --> 22:57.841
If La Grenouille is in DC,
this could lead us to him.

22:57.941 --> 22:58.941
Or DiNozzo.

22:59.241 --> 23:01.706
Well, obviously, DiNozzo
is our first priority.

23:01.741 --> 23:04.441
Start with the hospital. Find out
when DiNozzo left and with who.

23:04.476 --> 23:06.841
And who was driving his car. Got it.

23:07.941 --> 23:09.141
Director Shepard.

23:09.641 --> 23:11.041
Mr. Kort.

23:11.841 --> 23:13.991
An unannounced visit by the CIA

23:14.026 --> 23:16.141
usually means someone's in trouble.

23:16.341 --> 23:17.641
I trust it isn't you.

23:19.641 --> 23:20.741
Where is he?

23:21.141 --> 23:23.141
It depends on who "he" is.

23:23.176 --> 23:24.176
DiNozzo.

23:24.241 --> 23:27.691
I honestly don't know, And even
if I did, I wouldn't tell you

23:27.726 --> 23:31.141
until you explained to me why
you're looking for him so urgently.

23:31.541 --> 23:35.106
La Grenouille flew to DC this morning.

23:35.141 --> 23:36.941
He didn't arrive at
his safe house and his

23:37.041 --> 23:39.141
satellite phone has
stopped transmitting.

23:39.341 --> 23:41.941
Mislaid your arms dealer...
that's got to be embarrassing.

23:43.141 --> 23:44.941
I don't know what NCIS is up to,

23:45.041 --> 23:47.741
but I want a private
briefing in your office now.

23:48.141 --> 23:52.141
I'll decide what briefing you get,
and where you get it, Mr. Kort.

23:52.341 --> 23:53.906
And if you have a problem with that,

23:53.941 --> 23:56.541
why don't you have your
director give me a call.

23:56.941 --> 24:00.241
You're jeopardizing one of
the most important long-term

24:00.276 --> 24:03.141
covert operations the
agency has ever conducted.

24:03.241 --> 24:04.641
Operation Lodestone.

24:06.141 --> 24:07.841
You're not read-in on Lodestone.

24:07.941 --> 24:09.141
Okay, so read us in.

24:09.441 --> 24:11.941
Unless the CIA just
believes in one-way traffic.

24:13.041 --> 24:15.041
This is not going to end well for you.

24:19.141 --> 24:21.941
Special Agent DiNozzo's
car was bombed this morning,

24:21.976 --> 24:23.541
but I guess you knew that.

24:25.641 --> 24:26.641
He wasn't in it.

24:27.341 --> 24:28.341
Thanks for sharing.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.941
The Agency had nothing to do with it.

24:31.141 --> 24:34.141
Is that when you mislaid your
Frog in all that confusion?

24:38.341 --> 24:40.341
My car blew up this
morning. Did you do that?

24:42.741 --> 24:44.641
Where did you go with La Grenouille?

24:56.541 --> 24:58.041
Actually, he prefers Rene.

24:58.341 --> 25:00.641
Arms dealers get very touchy
about their code names.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.241
The Frog has a kind of
slimy overtone to it.

25:03.341 --> 25:05.141
You should keep that
in mind for next time.

25:05.241 --> 25:07.041
You could use it yourself.

25:07.441 --> 25:09.941
We will find him, DiNozzo.

25:10.841 --> 25:12.441
You might want to take the stairs.

25:12.841 --> 25:14.541
I have a little upset
tummy this morning.

25:17.241 --> 25:18.441
Happy Frog hunting.

25:20.241 --> 25:21.241
What?

25:21.341 --> 25:22.341
No balloons?

25:26.941 --> 25:28.241
That was more exciting live.

25:31.241 --> 25:32.541
You saw it? You were there?

25:32.741 --> 25:33.741
Saw it...

25:34.041 --> 25:35.041
heard it,

25:35.541 --> 25:36.541
felt it.

25:38.841 --> 25:40.341
You can start whenever you're ready.

25:46.141 --> 25:49.241
He was waiting when I left the
hospital this morning with Jeanne.

25:50.441 --> 25:51.841
She'd arranged it.

25:52.541 --> 25:54.541
It was her little surprise, I guess.

25:54.941 --> 25:56.141
"Meet the parents"...

25:57.341 --> 25:58.341
part two.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.141
I hate sequels.

26:02.441 --> 26:04.441
Figured my cover was
blown as soon as I saw him.

26:04.841 --> 26:06.941
Turned out he'd known for months.

26:07.641 --> 26:08.641
Probably.

26:09.441 --> 26:10.941
I tried talking my way out of it.

26:11.741 --> 26:13.141
Made it as far as my car.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.341
Crap.

26:16.441 --> 26:18.641
There's no need to take your car.

26:18.741 --> 26:20.241
Henri will drive it.

26:20.941 --> 26:22.591
You come with Jeanne and me.

26:22.626 --> 26:24.241
That's really nice of you.

26:24.641 --> 26:26.406
I got to go. I really...

26:26.441 --> 26:29.141
- I need to go home, change because...
- I will have to insist...

26:29.176 --> 26:31.341
Agent DiNozzo.

26:34.841 --> 26:36.841
Careful in second, it
tends to stick a little.

26:37.041 --> 26:38.441
And your cell phone.

26:40.741 --> 26:41.841
Both of them.

26:46.541 --> 26:48.641
Did La Grenouille tell
Jeanne who you were?

26:49.341 --> 26:51.041
They didn't miss a beat.

26:51.641 --> 26:53.041
Pretended everything was fine.

26:54.141 --> 26:55.241
That didn't last long.

26:55.741 --> 26:58.741
I could see his guy
driving my car a few...

26:59.341 --> 27:01.241
car lengths behind us, when...

27:06.341 --> 27:08.541
Stay down! Allez! Allez!

27:10.741 --> 27:12.941
What was La Grenouille's first reaction?

27:14.041 --> 27:15.741
That he was the target.

27:17.141 --> 27:18.341
I'm not so sure.

27:18.741 --> 27:20.241
You think it was you?

27:20.441 --> 27:21.441
It was my car, boss.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.941
And we have certainly pissed
off the Agency a lot lately.

27:25.741 --> 27:28.741
The Director and I have pissed
off the Agency a lot lately.

27:28.841 --> 27:30.041
Although, mainly me.

27:31.241 --> 27:33.441
For what it's worth, Kort
denied Agency involvement.

27:33.841 --> 27:36.741
That's because Kort doesn't
play by agency rules.

27:37.141 --> 27:38.441
Guy's got a hair trigger.

27:38.941 --> 27:40.641
Where did La Grenouille take you?

27:41.941 --> 27:43.941
Kind of blew away the breakfast plans.

27:44.941 --> 27:46.641
Blew away a lot of things.

27:48.341 --> 27:50.241
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

27:50.341 --> 27:53.541
You never really thought it
could end any other way, did you?

27:55.941 --> 27:57.241
You mean other than badly?

27:57.341 --> 27:59.241
You're not supposed to
fall in love with them.

27:59.341 --> 28:00.906
Thank you so much for that, Director.

28:00.941 --> 28:02.841
I'm going to keep that
in mind for next time.

28:03.041 --> 28:05.741
Wait a second... there's
not going to be a next time.

28:07.841 --> 28:09.241
What did Jeanne say?

28:10.241 --> 28:12.241
Nothing I'm going to tell you.

28:12.741 --> 28:14.541
Nothing you need to know, Director.

28:22.641 --> 28:24.541
- Where is La Grenouille?
- I don't know.

28:25.541 --> 28:27.241
He dropped me off at the main gate.

28:27.341 --> 28:28.341
Drove west.

28:28.441 --> 28:30.841
Probably heading to California.
He was driving pretty fast.

28:31.641 --> 28:33.441
He could even be there now.

28:34.741 --> 28:36.341
Talked about his future.

28:37.341 --> 28:38.641
Yeah? About what?

28:39.741 --> 28:41.106
Doesn't think he has one.

28:41.141 --> 28:43.341
- He probably doesn't.
- He wants out.

28:43.741 --> 28:44.741
Kort knows.

28:44.941 --> 28:47.241
It would explain why he's
so desperate to find him.

28:47.341 --> 28:49.241
The CIA's about to lose one of its...

28:49.541 --> 28:51.041
most prized assets.

28:51.241 --> 28:53.141
What exactly does he mean by "out"?

28:53.541 --> 28:56.341
Well, he's going to call
and arrange a meeting

28:56.841 --> 28:57.941
and give himself up.

28:58.641 --> 29:01.941
Because he says NCIS is
the only agency he trusts.

29:05.341 --> 29:06.341
What time?

29:07.141 --> 29:08.841
Did she say how long she would be gone?

29:11.241 --> 29:12.341
No, no, I understand.

29:12.641 --> 29:13.641
Thank you.

29:16.441 --> 29:17.741
What was that for?

29:18.141 --> 29:19.641
Believing I was dead.

29:19.741 --> 29:21.541
I never believed that you were dead.

29:21.641 --> 29:23.341
Ziva was the one that gave up on you.

29:24.741 --> 29:27.141
Don't even think about the head slap.

29:27.441 --> 29:29.441
Is everything cool with
the Director and Gibbs?

29:29.841 --> 29:30.841
Beyond cool.

29:30.876 --> 29:31.876
Almost icy.

29:32.741 --> 29:33.741
You seem anxious.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.541
I'm fine.

29:38.141 --> 29:39.541
Anyone call for me?

29:41.841 --> 29:43.841
If you're calling the
hospital, she's not there.

29:44.041 --> 29:46.941
She called the ER to let them know
she was going away for a few days.

29:48.541 --> 29:49.541
Going where?

29:50.241 --> 29:51.441
She did not tell them.

29:55.041 --> 29:56.041
She knows?

29:57.441 --> 29:58.441
She knows.

30:00.741 --> 30:02.041
What are you going to do?

30:02.141 --> 30:04.941
I am going to wait until the
morning and then talk to her.

30:07.441 --> 30:08.706
I knew you'd be all right!

30:08.741 --> 30:10.641
Everybody else gave you
up for dead, even Ziva.

30:13.241 --> 30:15.241
So I may have acted a little hastily.

30:17.441 --> 30:20.241
- That's my letter opener.
- Excellent balance and weight.

30:20.276 --> 30:23.041
The edge is a little dull,
but I have always admired it.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.441
Where's my American Pie coffee mug?

30:30.541 --> 30:31.741
Mighty Mouse stapler?

30:37.841 --> 30:38.941
My dear fellow,

30:39.141 --> 30:41.441
I never believed it for a moment.

30:42.741 --> 30:43.741
Welcome home.

30:44.441 --> 30:46.341
It's not every day
people think you're dead.

30:48.241 --> 30:49.641
I know who blew up Tony's car.

30:49.741 --> 30:51.341
Not Tony's car, but his alias' car.

30:51.441 --> 30:53.941
And not exactly who, but
more like how and why.

30:54.241 --> 30:55.441
Do you have a motive?

30:55.541 --> 30:56.541
Me? No.

30:57.341 --> 30:58.341
But they do.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.041
Every bomb maker has a signature.

31:01.541 --> 31:03.106
The components, the way it's assembled.

31:03.141 --> 31:06.041
Sometimes right down to the color
tape they use to bind it all together.

31:06.141 --> 31:09.741
In this case, the components are
common to at least nine other bombs

31:09.776 --> 31:11.441
that have gone off in
the last four years.

31:12.041 --> 31:13.541
I made the match on Interpol.

31:13.841 --> 31:16.141
The bombs have gone
off all over the world.

31:16.176 --> 31:17.941
Algeria, Indonesia,

31:18.141 --> 31:19.641
the Middle East, Chechnya.

31:19.741 --> 31:21.041
Anything linking the victims?

31:21.141 --> 31:22.441
They were all arms dealers.

31:22.541 --> 31:24.641
The only problem is,
Tony's not an arms dealer.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.641
His girlfriend's
father's an arms dealer.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.241
She's been working nights.

31:29.041 --> 31:30.841
I pick her up every
morning for breakfast.

31:30.941 --> 31:32.041
You parked the car...

31:32.141 --> 31:33.541
they strap on the bomb,

31:34.041 --> 31:35.041
set the timer...

31:35.241 --> 31:36.241
and walk away.

31:36.341 --> 31:37.941
You weren't the target, she was.

31:38.141 --> 31:39.141
Maybe she still is.

31:39.441 --> 31:40.441
Take Ziva.

31:43.141 --> 31:44.141
Good.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.541
Hello.

31:51.341 --> 31:52.741
Good evening, Madam Director.

31:55.941 --> 31:56.941
Good evening.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.141
I've been told you want to meet me.

32:00.641 --> 32:01.641
Long overdue...

32:02.541 --> 32:03.541
I'm sure.

32:04.341 --> 32:06.441
Just tell me where and when.

32:08.841 --> 32:09.841
Now...

32:11.341 --> 32:12.441
in your study.

32:18.141 --> 32:19.441
Hello Jenny.

32:42.439 --> 32:43.639
So here we are at last.

32:46.939 --> 32:48.039
Face to face.

32:48.639 --> 32:50.639
Not quite the way I expected to meet.

32:51.439 --> 32:52.439
Nor I.

32:54.539 --> 32:56.539
I must compliment you on your pursuit.

32:56.639 --> 32:58.739
I actually liked your agent...

32:59.539 --> 33:00.739
DiNozzo.

33:02.139 --> 33:03.339
So does your daughter.

33:04.739 --> 33:06.439
Very much. Yes.

33:08.039 --> 33:09.339
What do you want from us?

33:10.039 --> 33:12.939
Well, sanctuary, asylum,
call it what you will.

33:14.539 --> 33:18.639
In return for my extensive knowledge
of the arms market, I want protection...

33:19.339 --> 33:20.339
for my daughter.

33:21.139 --> 33:22.539
Protection from whom?

33:22.939 --> 33:25.039
Whoever tried to kill
his daughter this morning.

33:29.939 --> 33:31.439
Agent Gibbs, I believe.

33:32.739 --> 33:33.739
Well, it's true.

33:34.039 --> 33:37.039
My enemies come for my daughter,
they will see me suffer.

33:37.639 --> 33:38.639
She is safe.

33:40.739 --> 33:42.239
For the time being.

33:42.639 --> 33:43.639
Which enemies?

33:44.939 --> 33:45.939
I have many.

33:47.539 --> 33:48.539
Why now?

33:48.739 --> 33:51.339
This have something to do
with Operation Lodestone?

33:52.139 --> 33:53.239
He's well-informed.

33:53.539 --> 33:54.539
Read us in.

33:54.739 --> 33:55.739
On what?

33:56.839 --> 33:58.539
The arrogance of the CIA?

33:58.639 --> 33:59.639
To do what?

33:59.739 --> 34:01.939
Make me the biggest
arms dealer in the world?

34:02.939 --> 34:06.139
You control the illegal arms
trade. The CIA controls you.

34:06.839 --> 34:07.839
That was the idea

34:08.739 --> 34:10.139
till you came along.

34:10.174 --> 34:11.539
And someone found out.

34:12.839 --> 34:14.739
Another arme dealer.

34:15.039 --> 34:16.039
Perhaps.

34:17.938 --> 34:19.839
And I'm running out of time.

34:20.938 --> 34:22.739
I can no longer trust Kort.

34:23.739 --> 34:24.739
Did you ever?

34:28.938 --> 34:31.239
This isn't the first time
you were in this study.

34:35.039 --> 34:37.438
I met your father here on occasion...

34:39.839 --> 34:40.938
many years ago.

34:43.739 --> 34:45.139
Tell me about him.

34:48.339 --> 34:49.739
He was a fine man.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.438
He had a conscience.

34:52.438 --> 34:53.438
One day,

34:54.639 --> 34:56.039
it got the better of him.

34:58.339 --> 35:01.239
You believe the story
that my father took a bribe

35:01.339 --> 35:03.739
while overseeing an
arms reduction treaty?

35:04.039 --> 35:05.839
Sadly, that's not a story. That's fact.

35:06.339 --> 35:07.339
How do you know?

35:07.839 --> 35:09.639
Because I paid him that bribe.

35:18.539 --> 35:19.539
You killed him

35:20.739 --> 35:22.339
because he wouldn't take it.

35:25.639 --> 35:27.739
I can understand how hard it is

35:28.139 --> 35:29.139
to accept.

35:30.639 --> 35:31.739
My daughter is...

35:32.439 --> 35:33.839
She's facing the same...

35:34.839 --> 35:35.839
same struggle.

35:38.239 --> 35:39.239
It's not loaded.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.739
I guess he beat you to it.

35:44.839 --> 35:47.539
I didn't want you to do anything
rash before I had a chance to...

35:48.439 --> 35:49.539
explain myself.

35:51.239 --> 35:52.439
I need your protection.

35:54.939 --> 35:56.439
You have the bullets.

35:56.539 --> 35:57.839
Take the damn gun!

35:58.139 --> 35:59.539
Protect yourself.

36:00.739 --> 36:02.539
You are signing my death warrant.

36:03.939 --> 36:05.539
12 years overdue.

36:10.239 --> 36:11.239
Here's my number.

36:12.639 --> 36:14.039
In case you change your mind.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.939
You better leave before I do.

36:23.839 --> 36:26.939
I hope my daughter is
as loyal to her father

36:28.039 --> 36:29.539
as you are to yours.

36:38.939 --> 36:41.339
You just let your own personal
obsession get in the way

36:41.439 --> 36:43.289
of your professional responsibility.

36:43.324 --> 36:45.139
That's a lot of crap, and you know it.

36:46.139 --> 36:47.939
There are no deals for men like him.

36:48.239 --> 36:51.239
You want to chase after him right
now and arrest him without a warrant,

36:51.339 --> 36:54.339
you go right ahead, but we both
know that Kort will have him out

36:54.374 --> 36:56.174
- before breakfast.
- Then get a damn warrant!

36:56.239 --> 36:57.539
You get a warrant.

36:58.839 --> 37:01.639
But you'd better do it fast
before his friends get him first.

37:04.339 --> 37:06.439
If the weapon was
loaded, and I wasn't here,

37:08.239 --> 37:10.439
would you have pulled the trigger?

37:16.339 --> 37:17.639
I guess we'll never know.

37:36.039 --> 37:37.039
On the table.

38:03.539 --> 38:05.239
You ever lie to someone you love?

38:09.639 --> 38:10.639
Yes.

38:12.439 --> 38:13.639
They ever forgive you?

38:16.639 --> 38:18.139
They never found out.

38:19.739 --> 38:20.739
Mine found out.

38:22.939 --> 38:23.939
He told her?

38:27.639 --> 38:28.639
I did.

38:29.439 --> 38:31.039
I don't understand what's happening.

38:32.239 --> 38:33.739
Tony, that was your car.

38:33.774 --> 38:35.239
Your car that just...

38:35.439 --> 38:37.439
It could have been you.
It should have been you.

38:37.839 --> 38:39.239
Tell me that you love me.

38:39.739 --> 38:40.739
Tell me.

38:41.939 --> 38:44.139
I do. It's just... just
everything that's happened...

38:44.839 --> 38:45.839
happened today.

38:46.039 --> 38:47.839
Last night, the way you handled things.

38:47.874 --> 38:49.004
The gun... The gun.

38:49.039 --> 38:50.839
Firing it the way you did. And now this.

38:51.139 --> 38:52.939
It's like you're someone
else. Someone else.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.139
Someone I don't know.

38:55.339 --> 38:56.339
What is it?

38:57.339 --> 38:58.839
You are, aren't you?

38:59.139 --> 39:01.439
Aren't you? Someone else. Who?

39:02.039 --> 39:03.039
Who are you?

39:04.639 --> 39:08.039
I'm a Federal Agent. My name isn't
Tony DiNardo. It's Anthony DiNozzo

39:08.139 --> 39:10.439
and I work for the Naval
Criminal Investigative Service.

39:11.339 --> 39:13.539
This has all been a lie. A lie.

39:13.639 --> 39:15.939
Jeanne, listen to me. Not
all of it. Not everything.

39:15.974 --> 39:17.839
Just some things. Not
the important things.

39:18.039 --> 39:19.989
Why? Just tell me why
it is you'd do this.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.939
What it is I'm supposed to have done?

39:22.539 --> 39:23.539
Tell me.

39:23.839 --> 39:24.839
Tell me.

39:26.439 --> 39:27.439
It's not you.

39:32.639 --> 39:33.639
What?

39:35.539 --> 39:37.339
- What?
- You should ask him.

39:50.639 --> 39:52.639
He said she'd come back
after she calmed down.

39:52.674 --> 39:53.739
I guess he was wrong.

39:55.439 --> 39:56.839
I will put out a BOLO.

39:56.939 --> 39:59.039
- We will find her.
- She doesn't want to be found.

40:14.539 --> 40:15.539
No luck?

40:16.039 --> 40:17.039
Not at home.

40:17.239 --> 40:18.839
He has not replaced his cellphone yet.

40:19.039 --> 40:21.339
- Maybe he took the day off.
- Gibbs would have told us.

40:21.374 --> 40:23.339
Gibbs would have told you what?

40:24.839 --> 40:26.739
If Tony was taking some time off.

40:27.139 --> 40:28.104
You're right.

40:28.139 --> 40:31.039
There's always more work to be done
when you're a man down on the shift.

40:31.839 --> 40:33.539
Think I've got something here, boss.

40:33.939 --> 40:36.139
I found another one of La
Grenouille's shell companies.

40:36.439 --> 40:38.604
It's similar to the one
that leased the stretch limo,

40:38.639 --> 40:41.639
only this one leases a yacht
down at the Gangplank Marina.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.639
- Called the Mauretania.
- How big?

40:44.339 --> 40:46.439
80 feet. Three staterooms.

40:46.539 --> 40:48.115
Ziva checked with the marina management.

40:48.139 --> 40:49.939
Someone's been staying
there since saturday.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.389
Older guy with an accent.
They think he's French.

40:52.424 --> 40:54.539
- And a younger woman?
- No. He said he was alone.

40:54.574 --> 40:56.539
- Warrant?
- Just arrived from legal.

40:56.639 --> 40:59.150
It is all in order, but they
couldn't guarantee it wouldn't stop

40:59.174 --> 41:01.339
a concerted legal
challenge from the Agency.

41:01.374 --> 41:02.939
Let them try. Let's go.

41:45.439 --> 41:46.439
Clear!

41:47.239 --> 41:48.239
Clear!

41:48.939 --> 41:49.939
Clear!

41:53.039 --> 41:54.039
He's gone.

41:54.939 --> 41:56.239
Maybe he was never here.

41:59.239 --> 42:00.239
He was here.

42:08.539 --> 42:10.239
We'll catch up with him eventually.

42:10.839 --> 42:11.839
Or someone will.

42:12.839 --> 42:13.839
One day.
