00:00.606 --> 00:01.873
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.940 --> 00:04.341
But we can be friends.
I mean we are friends, right?

00:04.409 --> 00:06.844
Just... we can be
more than that.

00:06.912 --> 00:08.746
Jack Bartlett,
nice to see you again.

00:08.814 --> 00:09.881
He's a good guy,

00:09.948 --> 00:11.382
and he's not just
an oil guy.

00:11.449 --> 00:12.549
It's gonna take me
some time

00:12.617 --> 00:14.585
to get used to you
dating the enemy.

00:14.653 --> 00:16.687
Not everyone is motivated
by money, mom.

00:16.755 --> 00:17.453
Especially Caleb.

00:17.521 --> 00:19.589
Oh, then why did it take him
less than 10 seconds

00:19.657 --> 00:21.258
to accept
my sponsorship money?

00:21.325 --> 00:23.359
You paid him
to go away?

00:23.427 --> 00:24.494
What's this?

00:24.561 --> 00:26.196
It's a little somethin'
to help you out.

00:26.264 --> 00:28.564
Should be enough to tide you over
for a year or so.

00:28.632 --> 00:29.532
<i>She's a great girl, right?</i>

00:29.600 --> 00:30.834
<i>She sure is.</i>

00:30.902 --> 00:32.902
If you hurt her,
I'll have to kill you.

00:32.969 --> 00:33.869
You know that,
right?

00:33.937 --> 00:35.437
So what do you wanna do?

00:35.505 --> 00:37.606
I've actually, uh,
been talking to Scott.

00:37.674 --> 00:39.675
- Really?
- I could hang out with him,

00:39.742 --> 00:42.444
or... you know,
intern, apprentice.

00:42.512 --> 00:43.612
Well,
that's pretty awesome.

00:43.680 --> 00:44.847
There's somethin'
I gotta tell you.

00:44.915 --> 00:46.615
Well, I have something
I wanna tell you, too.

00:48.084 --> 00:50.618
Get the hell outta here!
Leave!

00:52.087 --> 00:53.521
More tests?

00:53.588 --> 00:55.756
Wednesday, next week,
8 am.

00:55.825 --> 00:57.192
I'll be there.

00:57.259 --> 00:58.226
Just say it.

01:00.595 --> 01:01.529
I love you.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.117
- Good morning.
- Oh, wow!

02:01.185 --> 02:03.588
Someone's starting
the day off right.

02:03.655 --> 02:04.889
He still hasn't called.

02:04.956 --> 02:06.223
- Who?
- Who do you think?

02:06.591 --> 02:07.591
Peter.

02:07.659 --> 02:09.193
Well, he's in Dubai.

02:09.261 --> 02:10.894
What, they don't have phones
in Dubai, now?

02:12.864 --> 02:14.498
Don't give me that
"what do you expect

02:14.565 --> 02:16.132
from an oil guy" look,
okay?

02:16.200 --> 02:17.768
<i>It is 6 o'clock in the evening</i>
<i>there and...</i>

02:17.835 --> 02:19.703
<i>Mm-hm, and he's probably</i>
<i>out for dinner!</i>

02:19.771 --> 02:21.605
Yeah, he's probably out
for dinner with someone else.

02:21.672 --> 02:23.172
Oh, a little bit insecure,
are we?

02:23.240 --> 02:24.207
Easy for you to say!

02:24.275 --> 02:25.308
Your guy's
a stone's throw away.

02:25.376 --> 02:27.610
Mm-hm. I know,
and I love it!

02:27.677 --> 02:29.011
Okay. Bye.

02:35.752 --> 02:37.553
Hello?

02:37.621 --> 02:40.088
Yep, he's here.
Hang on.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.290
It's Lisa!

02:43.492 --> 02:44.826
Hey there!

02:44.894 --> 02:47.094
Welcome back, stranger.

02:47.162 --> 02:48.797
When did your flight
get in?

02:53.769 --> 02:54.803
Hey!

02:54.870 --> 02:56.604
- Hello!
- Good morning!

02:56.672 --> 02:58.371
I wish I could
just skip school.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.205
It's only
a few more weeks.

02:59.273 --> 03:00.273
I know!

03:00.341 --> 03:02.743
Then lots of time
to spend together.

03:02.811 --> 03:04.711
- You should really, um, go...
- What?

03:04.779 --> 03:05.913
- To school.
- Mmm...'Kay!

03:07.348 --> 03:08.381
Ow!

03:09.451 --> 03:10.751
I am gonna miss my bus!

03:10.819 --> 03:11.819
Goodbye!

03:14.855 --> 03:15.655
<i>Hey!</i>

03:16.690 --> 03:19.291
You're not gonna miss it.

03:21.227 --> 03:22.595
- On?
- Yup.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.200
Bye!

03:28.268 --> 03:28.968
Have a good day!

03:34.707 --> 03:36.475
<i>You guys are unbelievable!</i>

03:36.542 --> 03:37.976
- What?
- Oh, come on!

03:38.043 --> 03:39.978
It took you how long
to get together?

03:40.045 --> 03:40.812
Yeah, and now
you're inseparable!

03:40.880 --> 03:43.014
Uh, yeah.
It's totally vomit-inducing.

03:43.082 --> 03:44.215
Oh, thanks.
Harsh.

03:44.283 --> 03:45.649
Well, it is!

03:45.717 --> 03:47.451
True love.
Keep it.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.119
You're such a cynic!

You are?

Amy Fleming.

08:26.614 --> 08:29.182
Stewart Forrest,
Caesar's trainer.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.884
He's a great horse,
he's an Olympic hopeful.

08:30.952 --> 08:32.753
So, uh...

08:32.820 --> 08:35.621
I mean, I don't know
how you did that, but...

08:35.688 --> 08:37.489
Thank you.

08:37.557 --> 08:38.557
You're welcome.

08:44.864 --> 08:46.164
<i>- Who is that?</i>
<i>- Amy?</i>

08:50.169 --> 08:51.570
Amy!

08:51.638 --> 08:53.004
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:53.072 --> 08:54.906
Hey, Ty!
I need your help here!

08:54.974 --> 08:57.474
There's some horses
still trapped in the trailer.

08:57.510 --> 08:59.144
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah! Go. Go!

09:04.182 --> 09:06.717
That was, uh...
quite somethin'

09:06.785 --> 09:08.252
what you did there.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.953
I didn't do anything!
I just...

09:10.221 --> 09:12.089
I just got him calmed down.

09:15.759 --> 09:17.293
Come on, let's give
these guys a hand.

09:35.144 --> 09:36.578
<i>Well, they finally got 'em</i>
<i>all rounded up,</i>

09:36.646 --> 09:38.179
but what a mess!

09:38.247 --> 09:39.781
Must've been terrible!

09:39.849 --> 09:42.484
<i>Well, it could've been</i>
<i>a lot worse.</i>

09:42.552 --> 09:44.052
I wish you could've seen
your sister.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.087
Grandpa...

09:46.155 --> 09:49.023
She got that horse to calm down
I don't know how,

09:49.090 --> 09:50.024
but she did.

09:51.426 --> 09:54.328
Reminded me so much
of your mother.

09:54.696 --> 09:57.264
<i>She was cool,</i>
<i>she was calm,</i>

09:57.332 --> 09:58.900
huge crowd of people there,

09:58.967 --> 10:01.669
but you coulda heard
a pin drop.

10:01.737 --> 10:03.203
<i>Oh my God, Amy!</i>
<i>I just saw it on the news,</i>

10:03.271 --> 10:05.572
it was incredible!
You were amazing.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.741
And that poor horse!
Is he gonna be okay?

10:07.808 --> 10:09.075
I think so.

10:09.143 --> 10:10.443
Oh. I'll get it!

10:11.412 --> 10:12.779
Help yourself, Mallory.

10:12.847 --> 10:14.280
Thanks.
I was so ticked off,

10:14.348 --> 10:15.682
I mean, if I woulda
still lived here,

10:15.750 --> 10:16.883
I would've gone to school
with you

10:16.951 --> 10:18.484
and I would've seen it all.
But oh no!

10:18.553 --> 10:20.218
<i>Ever since my parents</i>
<i>got back from the tour,</i>

10:20.286 --> 10:21.754
my insanely,
overprotective mother

10:21.821 --> 10:23.055
has to drive me to school
everyday!

10:23.122 --> 10:24.189
This looks good.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.291
What, they don't feed you
at home?

10:26.359 --> 10:27.826
<i>It's dad.</i>

10:30.096 --> 10:31.864
Hey.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.099
No...
No, she's just fine.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.769
<i>Oh, you heard it</i>
<i>on the news?</i>

10:38.336 --> 10:40.772
Oh, yeah, it's...
Somethin' else all right.

10:40.839 --> 10:43.307
Can I talk to him,
please?

10:43.375 --> 10:45.743
Wha...
What did you just say?!

10:47.046 --> 10:49.113
- I guess not.
- Now, why...

10:49.181 --> 10:50.281
Why would you do

10:50.348 --> 10:52.348
<i>a damn fool thing</i>
<i>like that?</i>

10:52.416 --> 10:54.417
<i>Fine!</i>
<i>Hang up, then!</i>

10:56.554 --> 10:57.520
Cows.

10:59.724 --> 11:00.958
He bought another
herd of cows!

11:02.794 --> 11:05.696
Okay...
And what's the big deal?

11:05.763 --> 11:07.497
Who knows?

11:07.565 --> 11:08.464
I'm gona go do night check.

11:08.531 --> 11:09.732
Mm-hmm.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.300
Okay.
I'm comin' with you.

11:11.367 --> 11:12.301
I'll help!

11:14.705 --> 11:16.472
Oh, right.
Night check.

11:29.418 --> 11:31.185
You were pretty quiet
at dinner.

11:31.253 --> 11:33.088
What's wrong?
You okay?

11:33.155 --> 11:34.756
Yeah.
Are you okay?

11:34.824 --> 11:37.759
Yes! Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

11:37.827 --> 11:40.194
Because it's a pretty
traumatic situation!

11:45.634 --> 11:46.601
Ty...

11:47.802 --> 11:49.470
Hey.

11:49.538 --> 11:51.071
What's wrong?

11:52.141 --> 11:54.041
What I saw this morning,

11:54.109 --> 11:56.843
the horses,
in the trailer?

11:57.445 --> 12:00.713
You know, I gotta admit,
I almost lost it.

12:00.781 --> 12:04.451
I mean, it made me
physically sick.

12:04.519 --> 12:05.752
Two of them
were so messed up

12:05.819 --> 12:08.321
they had to be euthanized
right on the spot.

12:11.492 --> 12:13.259
You know,
I gotta wonder,

12:13.326 --> 12:14.627
I've applied to this
vet program,

12:14.694 --> 12:17.229
and I don't even know if I've got
what it takes to do the job.

12:19.966 --> 12:22.368
You'll be great.

12:23.370 --> 12:25.037
You will.

12:25.104 --> 12:27.739
Come on!

12:27.807 --> 12:29.040
You know,
Scott has nothing

12:29.107 --> 12:30.575
but good things
to say about you,

12:30.643 --> 12:33.278
and you wouldn't be...
human

12:33.345 --> 12:36.247
if you weren't disturbed
by what happened.

12:36.315 --> 12:39.184
Ah, I don't know.

12:40.852 --> 12:43.788
I'm almost hoping
I won't get accepted.

12:45.323 --> 12:48.225
When do you hear?

12:49.294 --> 12:50.194
Any day.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.963
So you can decide then,
right?

12:57.869 --> 12:59.503
<i>So, how was it?</i>

12:59.571 --> 13:00.870
<i>Fabulous!</i>

13:00.938 --> 13:03.639
Business was great,
went to a lot of auctions.

13:03.708 --> 13:05.441
Found some really interesting
breed stock.

13:05.509 --> 13:08.477
I think Fairfield's gonna be
bulging with babies this year.

13:08.545 --> 13:09.979
Good.

13:10.047 --> 13:12.182
Course it wasn't all work.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.717
Ate too much,

13:13.784 --> 13:15.218
drank my fair share,

13:16.153 --> 13:19.554
danced in the streets
with young French men.

13:20.690 --> 13:22.758
You're a juvenile
delinquent.

13:22.826 --> 13:24.093
Come here.

13:31.267 --> 13:33.500
He's certainly got cows,
all right.

13:33.568 --> 13:36.938
All I see is my money
walking around on four legs.

13:37.005 --> 13:38.272
Now listen,

13:38.340 --> 13:39.573
you decided to lend him
the money in the first place,

13:39.641 --> 13:41.342
you can't tell him
how to spend it.

13:41.409 --> 13:43.310
So, be diplomatic!

13:43.912 --> 13:45.446
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi!

13:45.513 --> 13:46.714
- Good to see you.
- You, too!

13:46.782 --> 13:49.249
So, how much did you pay
for that herd?

13:49.316 --> 13:51.151
- What's that?
- How much did you pay for the herd?

13:51.219 --> 13:53.820
- Oh, I got a great deal.
- Yeah? How much?

13:53.888 --> 13:55.321
Six hundred a head.

13:55.389 --> 13:57.624
Six hundred a head?!

13:57.691 --> 14:00.127
Okay. I'm gonna leave
you gentlemen to it.

14:00.194 --> 14:01.728
You look great, Lisa.

14:01.796 --> 14:03.396
<i>Thank you!</i>

14:03.464 --> 14:06.866
What kind of deal is that?
Six hundred a head!

14:06.933 --> 14:08.067
Everybody knows
the price of beef

14:08.135 --> 14:10.002
is sinking like a rock,
Tim.

14:10.070 --> 14:11.336
You might as well throw money
into the wind.

14:11.404 --> 14:12.671
- That's my money!
- Hey, hey!

14:12.739 --> 14:15.407
You asked me not to sell to Val,
so I didn't.

14:15.475 --> 14:16.742
Getting back into
the cattle business

14:16.810 --> 14:19.245
was the only way
I had of moving forward.

14:19.312 --> 14:21.112
Now, I appreciate your loan.
I do.

14:21.180 --> 14:22.580
So where's this month's
cheque, then?

14:22.598 --> 14:23.281
Lost in the mail?

14:23.348 --> 14:25.083
I'll cut you a cheque
by the end of the week.

14:25.151 --> 14:26.550
Relax!

14:26.618 --> 14:27.986
What's Callie think
of you getting back

14:28.053 --> 14:28.853
in the cattle business?

14:30.921 --> 14:32.056
Nothin'.

14:32.357 --> 14:34.392
Callie and I have
parted ways.

14:34.459 --> 14:35.760
It's got nothin' to do
with the cattle.

14:35.828 --> 14:37.795
Well,
when did that happen?

14:37.862 --> 14:39.263
A month ago.

14:42.733 --> 14:44.701
Mr. communication.

14:47.972 --> 14:50.774
Well, so much
for diplomacy, eh?

14:50.842 --> 14:52.442
Hang on. Lis,
um...

14:53.510 --> 14:56.045
Now, uh,
you have to promise

14:56.113 --> 14:59.182
that anything
you heard here

14:59.249 --> 15:02.618
never gets repeated
at the dinner table.

15:02.686 --> 15:06.222
You didn't tell the girls
you lent him money.

15:06.290 --> 15:08.257
Mr. communication.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.404
You want that?

15:23.472 --> 15:26.540
No, I'm stuffed.
I can't eat any more.

15:31.646 --> 15:33.914
Mmm, mmm.
These are good!

15:33.982 --> 15:34.915
Mm-hm!

15:42.323 --> 15:43.923
<i>You know what?</i>

15:46.227 --> 15:49.329
I don't ever want things
to change.

15:50.465 --> 15:52.298
That doesn't sound
like you at all!

15:52.367 --> 15:53.367
Oh!

16:00.974 --> 16:02.207
Oh my God!
Where have you been?

16:02.275 --> 16:03.709
I have to show you
something!

16:03.777 --> 16:05.544
Come on,
step on it!

16:05.612 --> 16:07.012
You are not gonna
believe this.

16:09.215 --> 16:10.082
Come on!

16:13.319 --> 16:14.185
Easy...

16:17.055 --> 16:20.324
Uh...
"Miracle girl"?

16:22.661 --> 16:27.632
<i>It's already had</i>
<i>almost three thousand hits.</i>

16:27.700 --> 16:29.733
You're famous!

16:29.801 --> 16:32.068
Uh...

16:33.938 --> 16:35.539
This is crazy.

16:40.222 --> 16:42.523
<i>Thanks, Trevor.</i>
<i>I'll load it out back.</i>

16:42.590 --> 16:44.858
Jack. Jack, Jack.

16:44.927 --> 16:46.693
Look at this.
Every newspaper.

16:46.761 --> 16:49.830
Amy, on the front!
Heh! My Amy, huh?

16:49.898 --> 16:51.831
<i>That's great for business!</i>

16:51.899 --> 16:53.400
<i>The phone's been ringing</i>
<i>off the hook all weekend.</i>

16:53.467 --> 16:55.335
Lou can't keep up
with the email.

16:55.403 --> 16:56.202
Everybody that's coming
in here

16:56.270 --> 16:57.603
is talking about it.

16:57.671 --> 16:59.472
Can I get you a coffee?

16:59.540 --> 17:00.974
You shouldn't be throwing
your money around

17:01.042 --> 17:02.275
buying people coffee.

17:02.343 --> 17:03.944
Can I have
another coffee please?

17:04.011 --> 17:05.211
<i>Got it!</i>

17:05.279 --> 17:06.746
Look, I can afford
to treat you, Jack.

17:06.814 --> 17:07.846
Oh, sure,

17:07.914 --> 17:10.415
'cause it's my money
buying it!

17:10.483 --> 17:12.884
I can't win, can I?
Hmm?

17:14.354 --> 17:16.422
I should've made that deal
with Val Stanton.

17:16.489 --> 17:17.923
I should've sold her
that acreage,

17:17.991 --> 17:19.691
and I don't care if you
don't wanna be hemmed in

17:19.759 --> 17:21.260
by that woman
on both sides.

17:21.328 --> 17:23.394
You know, seriously?!

17:23.462 --> 17:24.595
I mean, it would
look good on you,

17:24.663 --> 17:26.297
having to deal with her
every day.

17:26.365 --> 17:27.665
Every day!
You know what?

17:27.732 --> 17:29.600
There's nothing I'd like
more than that!

17:32.237 --> 17:33.904
Hi, Val.
How are things?

17:41.712 --> 17:43.313
Last time I checked,
you moved out.

17:43.381 --> 17:44.681
Ooh, funny.

17:44.748 --> 17:46.016
I'm here
to exercise Copper.

17:46.084 --> 17:47.084
<i>Oh!</i>

17:47.151 --> 17:48.385
- Hello.
- Hey.

17:48.453 --> 17:51.254
I just had the strangest,
most awkward day ever.

17:51.322 --> 17:53.323
Everybody was different,
nobody was talking to me,

17:53.391 --> 17:54.557
except when they thought
I couldn't hear them,

17:54.625 --> 17:55.824
then they talked about me!

17:55.892 --> 17:57.826
Even my teachers were weird.

17:57.894 --> 17:59.061
I'm not complaining.

17:59.129 --> 18:00.363
I'm suddenly
the most popular kid in my class

18:00.464 --> 18:01.964
just 'cause I know you!

18:02.032 --> 18:03.132
It's pretty cool.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.600
That's not cool!

18:04.667 --> 18:05.767
<i>Hi, everybody!</i>

18:05.835 --> 18:07.236
Hey.

18:07.304 --> 18:09.205
You ready to stack that hay?

18:09.272 --> 18:10.939
I can't. I gotta go on
a call with Scott.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.107
I can do it later,
though.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.274
Well, I want it done
before "later."

18:13.342 --> 18:14.942
Well, I can do it,
grandpa.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.811
Uh, just let me change.

18:16.879 --> 18:17.745
Thank you!

18:22.718 --> 18:24.718
<i>See ya in a bit.</i>

18:27.755 --> 18:30.157
What are you smiling at?

18:30.225 --> 18:31.458
You guys are cute.

18:31.526 --> 18:32.726
Cute.

18:32.793 --> 18:34.194
Yeah, I mean, most people
would find it gross,

18:34.262 --> 18:36.296
I mean, I think it's gross
when my parents do it.

18:36.398 --> 18:37.531
Do what?

18:37.598 --> 18:39.533
<i>You know, kiss!</i>

18:39.600 --> 18:41.968
Like you're young,
or something.

18:42.037 --> 18:42.936
It's cute!

18:45.239 --> 18:46.239
Oh, good.

18:48.775 --> 18:49.675
- Tim.
- Hi, Val.

18:49.743 --> 18:51.077
Hi.

18:51.145 --> 18:53.746
Thanks for, uh...
for taking the time to talk.

18:53.813 --> 18:55.181
No problem.

18:55.249 --> 18:57.050
And about earlier,
I...

18:57.117 --> 18:59.051
Well, I hope you didn't take
anything I said the wrong way.

18:59.118 --> 19:00.718
It's just...
You know Jack.

19:00.786 --> 19:02.587
He knows how to push
my buttons.

19:02.655 --> 19:03.855
It's what we do.

19:03.923 --> 19:05.257
Yeah.
Forget about it.

19:06.392 --> 19:07.559
I know all about
family feuds,

19:07.626 --> 19:08.593
believe me.

19:08.661 --> 19:09.761
So, Val,

19:09.828 --> 19:11.296
I wanted to talk to you.
I've reconsidered,

19:11.364 --> 19:13.831
and I think I'd like
to sell you the property.

19:13.899 --> 19:16.200
This your way
of getting back at Jack?

19:16.268 --> 19:17.268
Having to deal with me

19:17.335 --> 19:18.936
penning him in
on two sides?

19:19.003 --> 19:21.972
No, see, that...
No.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.207
Well, but there is that.

19:24.509 --> 19:26.577
No, I think it would make
good economic sense

19:26.644 --> 19:27.945
for me at this time.

19:28.012 --> 19:31.948
Okay, I'll think about it.

19:32.015 --> 19:33.015
What?

19:33.084 --> 19:34.350
I'll think about it.

19:34.418 --> 19:36.819
May not make economic sense
for me at this time.

19:36.887 --> 19:39.122
But I will definitely
think about it.

19:39.190 --> 19:40.623
Listen, I really have
to keep moving.

19:40.691 --> 19:43.326
I've got this trainer
waiting. Sorry!

19:43.394 --> 19:44.794
Yeah, oh, no.
Yeah, go.

19:44.861 --> 19:47.229
I'll think about it!

19:47.297 --> 19:49.431
Yeah, you said that.

20:00.276 --> 20:02.144
<i>So, uh...</i>
<i>Stewart Forrest says hello.</i>

20:02.212 --> 20:03.578
Oh, you were at his place?

20:03.645 --> 20:04.812
We were checking
out the horses.

20:04.879 --> 20:06.714
They're all doing
pretty good, considering.

20:06.781 --> 20:08.082
Well, how's Caesar?

20:08.150 --> 20:09.450
His wounds
are healing fine.

20:09.518 --> 20:10.585
There's no infection.

20:10.652 --> 20:12.253
But he's not doing
that great.

20:12.321 --> 20:14.021
Stewart wants you
to come by the stables.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.823
Well, what does
he want me to do?

20:15.890 --> 20:18.092
Work another miracle!

20:19.427 --> 20:21.094
<i>The problem is,</i>

20:21.162 --> 20:22.929
he's got a world cup qualifier
in a couple of weeks,

20:22.997 --> 20:25.798
and we need all the points
we can get,

20:25.866 --> 20:28.067
if he's even gonna...

20:28.136 --> 20:30.670
Make the Olympic trials.

20:31.372 --> 20:34.508
But who knows if anyone's
gonna be able to ride him.

20:34.575 --> 20:35.741
<i>Since the accident,</i>

20:35.808 --> 20:38.744
<i>he doesn't like anyone</i>
<i>near him.</i>

20:43.116 --> 20:44.350
You're okay...

20:46.353 --> 20:47.353
Hi!

20:49.322 --> 20:51.123
Good boy!

20:51.190 --> 20:53.258
<i>Look at that!</i>
<i>He remembers you.</i>

20:56.028 --> 20:57.695
Hey, Carson.
I want you to meet Amy.

20:57.763 --> 20:59.063
<i>Amy Fleming.</i>

20:59.131 --> 21:00.064
Good to meet you.

21:00.132 --> 21:02.233
Amy, Carson McMaster.

21:02.301 --> 21:03.701
He's the chap who's supposed
to take this horse

21:03.769 --> 21:04.935
to the Olympics.

21:05.003 --> 21:06.504
<i>He's a hell of a rider.</i>

21:06.572 --> 21:09.005
<i>One of the best</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

21:09.073 --> 21:10.940
So...

21:11.008 --> 21:13.109
Do you think
you can help us out?

21:13.178 --> 21:15.579
Well,
I'll see what I can do.

21:15.647 --> 21:16.846
<i>I can't make any promises.</i>

21:16.914 --> 21:18.348
No, of course not.

21:19.651 --> 21:21.785
It would be better
if Caesar was at Heartland.

21:25.355 --> 21:27.056
All right,
we can try.

21:30.827 --> 21:31.760
Come on!

21:31.828 --> 21:32.828
Easy...

21:33.997 --> 21:36.399
Easy... easy, come on, boy.

21:36.466 --> 21:37.633
Stop! Stop!

21:38.134 --> 21:40.034
Easy, buddy.

21:40.102 --> 21:41.869
This horse is not ready
to be trailered.

21:41.937 --> 21:44.906
It's just gonna
set him back.

21:45.474 --> 21:47.742
You know, Heartland's really
not that far from here.

21:47.810 --> 21:48.910
I could ride over
on horseback,

21:48.977 --> 21:51.079
and then pony him back
on the trails.

21:51.146 --> 21:53.415
Okay.
Good, let's do it.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.988
<i>You know, I totally know</i>
<i>how he feels.</i>

22:02.056 --> 22:04.157
He's got such high hopes
for Caesar.

22:04.226 --> 22:06.460
The Olympics?!
Can you imagine?

22:06.528 --> 22:07.861
All you have to do
is look at Carson,

22:07.929 --> 22:09.963
and you know he can see it
all slipping away.

22:10.031 --> 22:12.332
I mean, all that training,
all that potential,

22:12.399 --> 22:14.300
all...

22:14.368 --> 22:16.402
Oh, God.
What if I fail?

22:16.470 --> 22:18.605
You didn't fail
with Spartan.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.573
Yeah, but Spartan didn't have
Olympic hopes

22:20.641 --> 22:22.408
hanging over his head.

22:22.476 --> 22:23.976
<i>Come on, Amy. Um...</i>

22:24.044 --> 22:26.646
Let's see,
Gallant Prince? Venture?

22:26.714 --> 22:28.647
People had totally given up
on those horses,

22:28.715 --> 22:30.515
and you, you know,
you worked your magic.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.685
It's not ma... Lou!
Look.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.721
Please don't say that, okay?
I...

22:35.788 --> 22:37.356
That stupid video!

22:37.423 --> 22:39.023
I'm not a miracle girl,
I'm...

22:39.091 --> 22:40.892
Hey! No pressure,
huh?

22:41.927 --> 22:43.527
None at all.

22:43.595 --> 22:44.995
Look,
if you do your best,

22:45.063 --> 22:46.731
maybe you can fix it
and maybe you can't.

22:46.798 --> 22:47.865
But you...

22:47.932 --> 22:51.235
You can't control
everything, okay?

22:51.303 --> 22:52.570
I should know, huh?

22:53.605 --> 22:55.072
So...

22:55.140 --> 22:57.107
Still no call
from Internet guy?

22:57.175 --> 22:58.142
Not a word.

23:00.010 --> 23:01.611
What is wrong with me,
you know?

23:01.679 --> 23:02.912
There's nothing wrong
with you, Lou.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.881
Well, there's gotta be
a reason.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.484
And I'm sure there is!
A good one.

23:07.551 --> 23:08.818
Grandpa,

23:08.886 --> 23:10.186
Lou's sad,

23:10.254 --> 23:12.656
she still hasn't heard
from Peter.

23:12.723 --> 23:14.591
Maybe grandpa
took a hint from Val,

23:14.659 --> 23:16.191
<i>paid him off.</i>

23:16.259 --> 23:18.761
Not a half bad idea!

23:18.828 --> 23:20.095
Yeah! I bet.

23:26.235 --> 23:29.004
Oh my God,
it's Peter!

23:30.072 --> 23:32.006
Hello, stranger!

23:32.073 --> 23:33.775
No!
Don't apologize.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.911
I've been so busy
that I haven't even,

23:36.978 --> 23:38.346
you know,
noticed you were gone.

23:41.983 --> 23:43.017
So, I'll call you

23:43.084 --> 23:44.218
once I've spent some time
with him.

23:44.286 --> 23:45.386
Yeah, please.

23:45.454 --> 23:46.554
Keep me posted,
yeah?

23:46.622 --> 23:47.621
Okay, I will.

23:52.927 --> 23:53.794
Good luck!

23:56.964 --> 24:00.233
You're a damn fool.
Horse is done.

24:00.702 --> 24:03.236
You have to accept that.

24:05.405 --> 24:07.807
You like the water,
don't you, bud?

24:07.874 --> 24:08.841
Yeah.
Good boy.

24:09.876 --> 24:11.544
Spartan likes the water.

24:12.612 --> 24:13.713
<i>Come on!</i>

24:14.715 --> 24:16.415
Join your buddy!

24:17.617 --> 24:19.351
<i>Come on!</i>

24:19.418 --> 24:21.185
There ya go!
Good boy.

24:30.830 --> 24:31.929
Hurry it up!

24:31.997 --> 24:33.798
Where are those burgers
and fries?

24:38.936 --> 24:40.103
Hello?!

24:40.171 --> 24:42.606
<i>Look where you're going!</i>

24:44.376 --> 24:45.876
It's hard to find
good help.

24:45.943 --> 24:47.110
Yeah, clearly.

24:47.178 --> 24:49.079
So, um, how's it going?

24:49.146 --> 24:50.113
It's good.

24:50.181 --> 24:51.314
You know,
he's still really tense,

24:51.382 --> 24:53.315
and super sensitive
and hard to get close to,

24:53.384 --> 24:54.283
but...

24:54.351 --> 24:55.618
We talkin' about Ty?

24:55.686 --> 24:56.986
Funny, no.

24:57.053 --> 24:59.121
Caesar, the horse that was stuck
in the barbed wire.

24:59.189 --> 25:00.321
Ooh....

25:00.390 --> 25:01.857
The one you worked
your "miracle" on.

25:02.992 --> 25:03.958
Hello, girls.

25:06.128 --> 25:07.061
Hi, Ashley.

25:08.964 --> 25:11.165
Hi, Mrs. Stanton.
What can I get you?

25:11.233 --> 25:12.267
Coffee, please.

25:12.334 --> 25:13.802
Black. To go.
Thank you.

25:15.237 --> 25:17.538
So, saw you in the paper.

25:17.606 --> 25:18.873
Pretty amazing story.

25:18.940 --> 25:20.207
Yeah.

25:20.275 --> 25:23.744
He's an outstanding horse,
lots of potential.

25:23.812 --> 25:25.045
Are you working with him?

25:25.113 --> 25:26.046
I am.

25:27.248 --> 25:28.516
Well, when you're done
with him,

25:28.583 --> 25:29.983
come see me.

25:30.051 --> 25:31.851
I could use
a miracle or two.

25:35.723 --> 25:36.956
Ashley...

25:38.292 --> 25:39.559
What?!

25:39.627 --> 25:41.060
Well, all I'm saying is,
if my mom was going through

25:41.128 --> 25:42.228
what your mother's
going through,

25:42.296 --> 25:43.830
I... I wouldn't be
treating her like that.

25:43.898 --> 25:46.733
Well, your mom
is not my mom!

25:48.334 --> 25:51.503
Okay, so she's sick,
and that's too bad.

25:51.571 --> 25:54.306
<i>But what she did</i>
<i>is unforgivable,</i>

25:54.373 --> 25:56.608
and I'm not gonna let her
manipulate my life anymore.

25:58.645 --> 26:00.245
I know it's a taboo subject,

26:00.313 --> 26:02.347
but have you heard
from you-know-who?

26:02.415 --> 26:05.550
A few pathetically
pleading phone calls and texts

26:05.617 --> 26:07.284
a couple of months ago,
when he left for the circuit,

26:07.352 --> 26:09.587
<i>but nothing since.</i>
<i>But that's okay!</i>

26:09.655 --> 26:10.855
'Cause if I never
see him again,

26:10.923 --> 26:12.590
it will be too soon!

26:42.418 --> 26:44.086
Cute!

26:44.153 --> 26:45.955
I'm working at Maggie's,
now.

26:46.022 --> 26:47.957
Gotta pay my own way.

26:49.459 --> 26:50.993
What're you
doing here?

26:51.060 --> 26:52.560
Circuit's done.

26:52.628 --> 26:53.628
What're you doing here?

26:53.696 --> 26:54.762
I live here.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.197
Uh, no.

26:56.264 --> 26:57.398
This is my place.

26:57.466 --> 27:00.067
Not anymore,
you gave it up!

27:00.135 --> 27:02.036
Look, Ash,

27:02.104 --> 27:03.104
I know you're upset
with me,

27:03.171 --> 27:04.639
I get that,
I really do.

27:04.707 --> 27:05.807
But this is my trailer.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.341
And now that
the circuit's done,

27:07.409 --> 27:09.342
I'm moving back in.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.812
Not likely, cowboy Bob!

27:17.018 --> 27:18.719
Ashley!

27:18.786 --> 27:20.020
Ashley!

27:33.456 --> 27:34.222
Good boy!

27:34.323 --> 27:35.858
Here, here, here.

27:36.993 --> 27:39.528
Whoa.
Back up, back up.

27:41.064 --> 27:42.031
Good boy.

27:48.236 --> 27:49.704
Hey!

27:55.143 --> 27:56.077
Sorry!

28:29.610 --> 28:30.843
Good boy.

28:34.747 --> 28:37.448
Oh!
You did that on purpose!

28:37.516 --> 28:39.017
Now, why would I do that?

28:39.085 --> 28:40.652
I don't know, maybe
'cause you're such a boy!

28:40.720 --> 28:41.720
Ah!

28:42.888 --> 28:44.222
Hey, hey!

28:47.126 --> 28:47.726
Oof!

28:51.596 --> 28:53.263
Ah, okay!

28:53.331 --> 28:54.297
Ahhh!

28:59.904 --> 29:00.904
Whatcha looking for?

29:00.972 --> 29:02.272
Pressure points.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.508
It's like a type of massage.
My mom used to do it.

29:04.575 --> 29:06.275
Yeah, he really enjoyed
the water, huh?

29:06.343 --> 29:08.310
Yeah! It's really good
for his muscles, too.

29:08.378 --> 29:09.879
I think he's more limber.

29:09.947 --> 29:11.748
Hey, you know, Scott mentioned
an equine water therapy place

29:11.815 --> 29:13.182
opened up
not far from Hudson.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.851
- Yeah?
- They use salt water.

29:14.918 --> 29:16.786
My mom used to believe
in that.

29:16.854 --> 29:19.122
Yeah, she said
it was very therapeutic,

29:19.189 --> 29:21.457
especially for horses
with muscle damage.

29:21.525 --> 29:22.824
She probably wrote something
about that in her journals.

29:22.892 --> 29:25.326
I should check it out.

29:25.394 --> 29:26.662
You should write
your own journals.

29:26.729 --> 29:27.996
Why?

29:28.064 --> 29:29.297
Well, you're a genuine
"horse whisperer" now.

29:29.365 --> 29:30.532
Why are you starting now?

29:30.599 --> 29:32.333
It says so on YouTube.
Ah?

29:32.401 --> 29:33.334
Don't!

29:33.402 --> 29:34.836
Miracle girl.

29:34.904 --> 29:36.004
Stop!

29:37.706 --> 29:38.539
Hey!

29:40.142 --> 29:41.108
Caleb.

29:43.145 --> 29:44.444
You're back.

29:44.512 --> 29:46.747
Yes, I am.

29:46.815 --> 29:48.215
- It's great to see you.
- Yeah.

29:48.283 --> 29:49.249
Thanks!

29:50.686 --> 29:51.952
Um...

29:52.020 --> 29:53.420
I'm gonna go check
on the horses.

29:57.391 --> 29:59.926
So, uh,
you and Amy, huh?

30:00.961 --> 30:01.995
Yeah.

30:02.063 --> 30:04.164
I actually heard
all about it.

30:04.231 --> 30:05.131
From Kit.

30:05.199 --> 30:06.166
Oh! Oh!

30:09.936 --> 30:11.036
What the hell was that?

30:11.104 --> 30:13.672
That was for hurting her!

30:18.277 --> 30:20.445
<i>You got quite a haul!</i>

30:20.513 --> 30:22.314
I made a buck or two.

30:22.381 --> 30:24.817
Well, I'm glad you made it
back in one piece.

30:24.884 --> 30:25.983
I'm a lucky man,
Jack.

30:26.051 --> 30:27.985
Some of the other boys
didn't fare so well.

30:28.053 --> 30:29.187
Remember Smokey Rolston?

30:29.254 --> 30:31.756
I do! Hell of a cowboy,
hard to beat.

30:31.824 --> 30:33.991
Well, his grandson, JJ,

30:34.059 --> 30:36.460
he got pretty wrecked up.

30:36.528 --> 30:38.096
His grandson?

30:40.565 --> 30:41.832
You know, I gotta say,

30:41.899 --> 30:45.435
this whole long distance
romance thing is not great.

30:45.502 --> 30:47.370
You and grandpa
are so lucky.

30:47.438 --> 30:49.072
You can go away
for months at a time,

30:49.140 --> 30:51.808
and you guys get along
without each other just fine!

30:51.876 --> 30:55.212
Meanwhile, I miss Peter
so much it's ridiculous!

30:55.279 --> 30:56.813
And it's your fault,
you started it.

30:56.881 --> 30:58.380
Guilty as charged.

30:59.415 --> 31:00.649
Don't get me wrong,

31:00.717 --> 31:03.219
I am not keen on this...
being apart thing.

31:03.286 --> 31:05.019
I miss Jack
when I'm away;

31:05.087 --> 31:07.321
I certainly hope
he misses me.

31:07.389 --> 31:08.556
Well, yeah!
Obviously!

31:08.624 --> 31:12.227
I mean, he just doesn't
show it, you know.

31:12.294 --> 31:14.195
And you guys are
much more...

31:14.263 --> 31:16.330
Mature about these things
at your age.

31:18.968 --> 31:20.600
So, what are your plans?

31:20.668 --> 31:23.570
Well, first off,
I gotta find work.

31:23.638 --> 31:25.639
I guess I could take you back
as a hand.

31:25.706 --> 31:27.741
Looks like we might be gettin'
pretty busy around the place,

31:27.809 --> 31:29.877
<i>what with Ty pulling out</i>
<i>to go to school...</i>

31:29.944 --> 31:31.845
Well, that's not
a for sure thing yet, Jack.

31:31.913 --> 31:33.981
Thanks!
But I got a bigger problem right now.

31:34.048 --> 31:36.215
Ashley's still living
in my trailer, and...

31:36.283 --> 31:38.885
Well, she doesn't exactly
seem to wanna, you know...

31:38.952 --> 31:40.019
Share.

31:40.087 --> 31:41.821
So I got nowhere to stay
but in my truck.

31:43.190 --> 31:45.258
Well, you can bunk
in the loft.

31:45.325 --> 31:46.893
Really?

31:46.960 --> 31:48.460
Sure!

31:48.528 --> 31:50.163
<i>Thanks. Thanks a lot!</i>

31:50.230 --> 31:51.397
And it'll just be temporary,

31:51.464 --> 31:52.597
until I straighten out
the whole trailer thing.

31:52.665 --> 31:54.166
Sure, sure.

31:54.233 --> 31:56.902
Cool!
I'll grab my stuff!

31:56.969 --> 31:59.570
<i>Thanks for a great dinner,</i>
<i>Jack.</i>

31:59.638 --> 32:01.439
The loft?

32:01.507 --> 32:02.941
The loft, sure.
Why?

32:03.810 --> 32:06.411
Fine! I'll just sleep
in Mallory's old room then.

32:06.478 --> 32:08.979
Yeah!
I think that's a great idea!

32:09.047 --> 32:11.315
Yeah, well, it's not!

32:14.619 --> 32:16.020
I can't believe this guy.

32:16.087 --> 32:17.621
He waltzes in here
with his stupid belt buckles...

32:17.689 --> 32:18.989
It's gonna be okay.

32:19.057 --> 32:20.390
You don't have to bunk
with him!

32:20.458 --> 32:21.692
Ah... okay,

32:21.759 --> 32:23.260
but it's just
for a little while!

32:23.328 --> 32:25.094
Huh? Good night.

32:27.198 --> 32:29.332
Sorry. Excuse me. Just...

32:30.367 --> 32:32.401
Turning in for the night!

32:38.209 --> 32:39.442
You drive carefully.

32:39.509 --> 32:40.909
Oh, I will.

32:42.511 --> 32:45.714
I... have a question
for you.

32:45.781 --> 32:47.349
Well, shoot.

32:48.384 --> 32:51.753
When I'm away,

32:51.821 --> 32:53.655
do you miss me?

32:53.723 --> 32:55.657
Do I miss you?!

32:55.725 --> 32:58.592
Yes! Do you miss me?

32:58.660 --> 33:00.828
Well, sure I do.

33:02.097 --> 33:03.764
But I know
you have to go,

33:03.832 --> 33:05.099
you've got a business
to run,

33:05.167 --> 33:07.902
and there's plenty
to keep me busy here.

33:07.970 --> 33:10.471
And the time goes by
real fast.

33:11.606 --> 33:12.605
'Kay.

33:22.316 --> 33:24.417
<i>Look, man.</i>
<i>I really appreciate this.</i>

33:24.485 --> 33:25.551
You won't even know I'm here.

33:25.619 --> 33:27.820
Besides,
it won't be for long.

33:28.922 --> 33:30.155
<i>I promise.</i>

33:34.560 --> 33:37.496
I hope I didn't hurt you
too much, but...

33:37.563 --> 33:39.932
I gave you fair warning
about messing with Kit.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.533
Okay,
for the record, man,

33:41.601 --> 33:43.435
I liked Kit,
and I never meant to hurt her!

33:47.339 --> 33:47.339
At least I didn't kill you,
right?

34:04.207 --> 34:05.408
Morning.

34:05.475 --> 34:06.142
How'd you sleep?

34:06.209 --> 34:07.309
Oh, barely.

34:07.376 --> 34:08.676
Caleb is definitely
not the first face

34:08.744 --> 34:11.045
I wanna see in the morning!

34:11.112 --> 34:12.447
How's this guy doing?

34:12.514 --> 34:14.049
- He's good.
- Yeah?

34:14.116 --> 34:15.317
Yeah, we're just gettin'
used to the trailer.

34:15.384 --> 34:16.784
He doesn't spook
at the sight of it now,

34:16.851 --> 34:18.152
which is good.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.621
You ready for the next step?
Huh?

34:20.688 --> 34:22.324
Good boy.
Let's go.

34:22.391 --> 34:23.523
It's not gonna hurt you.

34:27.395 --> 34:29.596
Easy! Easy!

34:29.664 --> 34:31.130
<i>You got it?</i>
<i>You got him? You got it!</i>

34:34.902 --> 34:37.670
Hmph! It's going well,
I see.

34:37.737 --> 34:39.938
Well, um...

34:40.007 --> 34:41.507
He's still a little shy
of the trailer,

34:41.574 --> 34:43.409
as you saw,

34:43.476 --> 34:45.643
but everything else
is coming really well.

34:45.712 --> 34:47.447
Uh, I mean,
he's great with people now.

34:47.514 --> 34:48.647
Not just with me,
but with Ty.

34:48.715 --> 34:49.748
Yeah.

34:49.815 --> 34:51.951
And uh,
we can lead him anywhere;

34:52.018 --> 34:53.853
We've had him in the river,
working on his muscles,

34:53.920 --> 34:55.753
and he's really relaxed, now.

34:55.821 --> 34:58.156
I think...
I think actually,

34:58.224 --> 35:00.959
he's gonna be able
to be saddled soon.

35:01.027 --> 35:01.994
Hey, boy.

35:02.061 --> 35:03.528
Whoa!

35:03.596 --> 35:06.164
Whoa! Hey, buddy,
come on!

35:06.232 --> 35:07.299
It's just...

35:07.367 --> 35:09.434
It's gonna take a little bit
of time.

35:09.502 --> 35:11.402
It's gonna take more than time.

35:11.470 --> 35:12.569
Look, I've seen your video,

35:12.637 --> 35:14.005
I know what you claim
to be able to do.

35:14.072 --> 35:15.473
I don't claim to be able
to do anything,

35:15.540 --> 35:16.740
I'm just trying to...

35:16.808 --> 35:17.841
<i>Trying to what?</i>
<i>What?</i>

35:17.909 --> 35:18.976
Make me think
it's gonna be okay?

35:19.044 --> 35:20.411
He's gonna be the same
as he was?

35:20.479 --> 35:21.412
I don't need that.

35:23.681 --> 35:25.149
I don't need false hope.

35:31.122 --> 35:32.989
I'm, ah, sorry.

35:33.924 --> 35:35.458
<i>We shouldn't have come</i>
<i>without calling.</i>

35:35.526 --> 35:37.827
So, uh, just carry on.

35:43.566 --> 35:46.101
<i>Lou tells me</i>
<i>she's got lineups of people</i>

35:46.169 --> 35:48.003
waiting for your services.

35:54.377 --> 35:58.180
How's it going
with that horse Caesar?

35:58.248 --> 35:59.213
Not great.

36:02.317 --> 36:05.086
I don't know, grandpa,
it's just so frustrating!

36:05.154 --> 36:07.321
Just because
I can calm him down

36:07.389 --> 36:08.356
after an accident,

36:08.424 --> 36:09.790
doesn't make me a...

36:09.858 --> 36:12.026
A miracle worker?

36:12.094 --> 36:13.061
Yeah.

36:16.697 --> 36:18.898
I didn't ask
for this to happen.

36:18.966 --> 36:21.401
You don't have to ask
for things to happen, Amy.

36:21.469 --> 36:23.070
They just do.

36:25.873 --> 36:28.675
And when they do?
We deal.

36:29.910 --> 36:31.310
And of all the people
I know,

36:31.378 --> 36:34.746
you're more than capable
of dealing.

36:36.483 --> 36:39.585
So once that horse gets
familiar with the trailer,

36:39.652 --> 36:42.421
Well...
The rest of his fears?

36:42.489 --> 36:45.458
Well...
They'll quiet down too.

36:46.359 --> 36:50.261
And then, he'll be off
to the Olympics.

36:59.072 --> 37:00.338
<i>Come on, Caesar.</i>

37:00.406 --> 37:02.708
You'll get a carrot!

37:02.775 --> 37:03.741
Good boy!

37:08.947 --> 37:10.581
Good boy!

37:28.665 --> 37:31.800
Come on, Caesar.
Follow your buddy!

37:34.838 --> 37:35.671
<i>Yeah, Amy!</i>

37:42.613 --> 37:44.979
Look, you don't have
to sell.

37:45.047 --> 37:45.880
I never wanted
you to sell;

37:45.948 --> 37:47.882
I told you that!

37:47.950 --> 37:48.883
That's why I loaned you
the money

37:48.951 --> 37:49.917
in the first place;

37:49.985 --> 37:51.786
So you wouldn't
have to!

37:51.854 --> 37:52.754
<i>And I'll stand</i>
<i>by that.</i>

37:53.822 --> 37:55.557
Well...

37:55.625 --> 37:57.659
I already put it out there
to Val.

37:57.726 --> 37:59.093
Might be too late.

38:00.128 --> 38:01.695
Look at that.

38:08.970 --> 38:10.671
She's something.

38:10.738 --> 38:12.206
She sure is.

38:23.274 --> 38:26.543
<i>I'm sorry you had</i>
<i>to get involved in my...</i>

38:26.610 --> 38:28.878
disagreement with Tim,
but...

38:28.945 --> 38:30.880
I understand you made
a deal with him?

38:30.947 --> 38:32.915
No, no, I haven't
made a deal yet,

38:32.983 --> 38:34.517
but I'm still thinking
about it.

38:34.585 --> 38:35.818
Fair enough.

38:35.886 --> 38:39.388
You'll be the first
to know though, Jack.

38:39.455 --> 38:41.790
So...
How're you doing?

38:43.226 --> 38:45.927
Oh, well,
they say I'm in remission,

38:45.995 --> 38:47.396
but...

38:47.463 --> 38:50.432
This blood thing is kind
of a tricky customer, so.

38:50.500 --> 38:51.833
And Ashley?

38:52.967 --> 38:55.035
Ashley?

38:55.103 --> 38:58.272
Well, the less she knows,
the better, I think.

38:58.340 --> 39:01.209
I'm not on very good terms
with her yet.

39:01.276 --> 39:03.411
I hear that,
uh, Caleb's back, huh?

39:03.478 --> 39:05.846
Yeah.
Yeah, he's living with us.

39:05.914 --> 39:09.949
I guess I should never
have done what I did.

39:10.017 --> 39:13.353
<i>Oh yeah, yep,</i>
<i>I bought him off.</i>

39:13.421 --> 39:15.622
No doubt about it!

39:15.690 --> 39:17.557
It seemed like the right thing
at the time, huh?

39:17.625 --> 39:18.791
I know how you feel.

39:18.859 --> 39:20.527
There's someone
I wouldn't mind buying off!

39:25.198 --> 39:28.300
I wanna thank you again
for all the appointments,

39:28.368 --> 39:30.068
and driving,
and everything.

39:30.136 --> 39:31.303
You know, I couldn't
have gone through it

39:31.371 --> 39:33.706
without you, Jack.
No.

39:34.173 --> 39:37.776
You're a true friend.
You really are.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.125
Good boy!

39:54.192 --> 39:56.060
Good boy, Caesar.

39:57.194 --> 39:59.095
Look at that!
That's amazing.

39:59.163 --> 40:00.930
<i>You are amazing!</i>

40:02.199 --> 40:04.200
Good boy.
Good boy.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.270
I still have some work to do
with him on his trust issues.

40:06.337 --> 40:08.305
But, maybe we could
work together,

40:08.373 --> 40:09.740
if you want?

40:09.807 --> 40:11.508
Yeah, absolutely!

40:11.576 --> 40:12.875
<i>Well, I'm thrilled!</i>

40:12.942 --> 40:14.543
You got this horse
back on track.

40:14.611 --> 40:16.078
I'm gonna tell everybody
about you!

40:16.146 --> 40:18.914
Uh... please don't!

40:23.987 --> 40:25.788
Hey.
What's wrong?

40:25.855 --> 40:27.055
Hmm.

40:27.791 --> 40:31.493
Just I have a zillion new emails
from everywhere.

40:32.395 --> 40:34.529
I don't know
how I'm gonna do this!

40:34.597 --> 40:36.331
Hey, you'll do it!

40:36.399 --> 40:38.032
<i>I don't know, I mean,</i>
<i>what if...</i>

40:38.100 --> 40:41.769
Hey! You'll be fine.
I'll help you, okay?

40:43.506 --> 40:45.273
Except you're leaving.

40:47.910 --> 40:49.143
Hey. Come here.

40:56.885 --> 40:58.119
I'm scared!

40:58.187 --> 40:59.220
I know.

41:00.755 --> 41:03.489
Hey, I got something
for you.

41:11.699 --> 41:12.699
A journal?

41:12.766 --> 41:15.001
Yeah! So you'd add
your own expertise.

41:17.503 --> 41:19.104
Just like my mommy!

41:20.540 --> 41:21.506
Thank you.

41:23.043 --> 41:24.710
<i>Uh...</i>

41:24.777 --> 41:27.546
Just turning in
for the night.

41:27.613 --> 41:28.547
- Yeah.
- 'Night.

41:29.816 --> 41:30.782
Well, all right.

41:32.752 --> 41:34.085
I am gonna do
whatever it takes

41:34.153 --> 41:36.154
to get him
outf of my loft!

41:36.222 --> 41:37.255
I don't care!

41:37.323 --> 41:38.356
We could set him up
with Ashley.

41:38.457 --> 41:39.757
With or without Ashley,

41:39.825 --> 41:41.159
he is going back
to that trailer!

41:41.227 --> 41:42.460
No matter what.

41:42.527 --> 41:43.494
Deal?

41:43.727 --> 41:44.994
Deal.

41:46.431 --> 41:48.766
When I was in France...

41:50.834 --> 41:52.168
I missed you!

41:53.371 --> 41:54.304
A lot.

41:56.540 --> 41:58.608
And next time I go,

41:59.110 --> 42:01.345
I am dragging you there!

42:02.412 --> 42:03.646
I don't think so!

42:03.714 --> 42:04.781
- I am!
- No way!

42:04.948 --> 42:08.650
- Yes, I am!
- No, I will not get on a plane.

42:08.718 --> 42:10.953
You have been on a plane?!

42:11.021 --> 42:15.224
Yes, I've been on a plane,
but not for 30 years!

42:15.292 --> 42:16.225
Really?

42:16.293 --> 42:17.793
Really.

42:17.861 --> 42:19.528
Why?

42:19.596 --> 42:22.330
Well, 'cause there's nowhere
I could go

42:22.398 --> 42:25.633
that's nicer
than right here.

42:27.403 --> 42:29.637
Especially right now.

42:34.910 --> 42:36.378
And yeah...

42:38.880 --> 42:40.414
I do miss you.

42:42.017 --> 42:43.017
Good.

42:48.456 --> 42:50.624
See, that isn't gross,
is it?

42:50.691 --> 42:51.758
Gross?

42:53.127 --> 42:54.860
What do you mean,
gross?

42:54.929 --> 42:56.629
You sound like Mallory.

42:56.696 --> 42:59.565
We're not too old
to be...

42:59.633 --> 43:01.234
