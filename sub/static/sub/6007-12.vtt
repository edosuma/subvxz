RUDY: <i> The idea behind the DRNs

No.

DORIAN:
It's Samantha.

02:29.045 --> 02:31.179
Yep.

02:31.214 --> 02:32.481
Hey, no, Dorian...

02:32.515 --> 02:33.715
Uh, John Kennex's line.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.284
Uh, he does not

02:35.318 --> 02:36.985
wish to speak
with you right now.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.687
He is waving his hands,

02:38.721 --> 02:39.988
gesturing "no."

02:42.292 --> 02:43.492
Yes, I understand.

02:43.526 --> 02:45.794
I hate it
when he does that, too.

02:46.729 --> 02:47.969
Yeah, I know.

02:47.997 --> 02:49.531
That's the least
of his problems.

02:49.565 --> 02:50.832
Okay.

02:50.867 --> 02:52.167
You take care.

02:52.201 --> 02:54.002
Would you like me
to relay her message?

02:54.037 --> 02:55.938
No, I think I got it.

02:55.972 --> 02:57.406
Thanks.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.676
Do you want to talk about it?

03:00.710 --> 03:03.111
Samantha and I
had dinner last night...

03:03.146 --> 03:04.866
and the hologram
of her roommate and her mom

03:04.881 --> 03:06.682
and her therapist.
Every single call

03:06.716 --> 03:07.716
she got, she took.

03:07.750 --> 03:08.917
She holo-blocked you.

03:08.952 --> 03:11.320
Exactly. I mean,
whatever happened

03:11.354 --> 03:13.789
to two people just sharing
a meal and connecting, you know?

03:13.823 --> 03:15.524
- I know.
- You wouldn't know.

03:15.558 --> 03:17.960
Why am I asking you?
You wouldn't have a clue.

03:17.994 --> 03:20.596
Well... and I'm
just positing this...

03:20.630 --> 03:21.830
perhaps you're boring.

03:21.864 --> 03:24.233
Boring?
You're calling me boring?

03:24.267 --> 03:25.901
We need to talk about guy code.

03:25.935 --> 03:27.102
There's certain things
you don't do...

03:27.136 --> 03:28.537
Hey, I need you to help me

03:28.571 --> 03:29.638
check out a possible homicide.

03:29.672 --> 03:30.952
Sure. When did the call come in?

03:30.974 --> 03:32.407
It didn't.

03:32.442 --> 03:34.109
There's no sign of forced entry,
no struggle.

03:34.143 --> 03:36.311
No foul play indicated at all.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.447
EMTs are calling it
cardiac arrest.

03:38.481 --> 03:39.815
I don't understand.

03:39.849 --> 03:41.149
Why is it considered
a possible homicide?

03:41.184 --> 03:42.417
The victim's a chrome.

03:42.452 --> 03:44.119
We're genetically engineered.

03:44.153 --> 03:45.621
We don't die young.

03:56.466 --> 04:00.068
The deceased's name
is Brian Barrow, 28.

04:00.103 --> 04:03.071
Bond trader
at Kane Asset Management.

04:03.106 --> 04:05.607
JOHN: Explains the view.
Anything missing?

04:05.642 --> 04:07.943
According to the report, no.

04:07.977 --> 04:10.812
Rules out robbery as a likely motive.
Medical history?

04:10.847 --> 04:12.147
Typical chrome.

04:12.181 --> 04:13.248
No health issues.

04:13.283 --> 04:16.317
World-class athlete,
a swimmer.

04:16.351 --> 04:18.853
He competed in the
Detroit Olympics of 2036.

04:18.887 --> 04:20.923
There's no logical explanation
for this.

04:20.957 --> 04:22.491
How could he die like this?

04:22.525 --> 04:23.926
We should do a toxicology.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.062
Maybe EMTs got it right:
heart attack.

04:27.096 --> 04:30.232
No. When a chrome is designed,
every box is checked:

04:30.266 --> 04:32.467
health, beauty, intelligence.

04:32.502 --> 04:34.403
Look, I know chromes
aren't supposed to have

04:34.437 --> 04:37.105
congenital defects;
perfect genes and all that.

04:37.140 --> 04:38.907
Chromes don't normally
become cops, either.

04:38.942 --> 04:41.009
There's a first time
for everything.

04:41.044 --> 04:43.011
DORIAN:
Look at this.

04:44.658 --> 04:46.658
There's a half-millimeter
puncture wound

04:46.683 --> 04:48.050
at the base of his skull.

04:48.084 --> 04:49.885
It goes all the way
to his cerebral cortex.

04:49.919 --> 04:52.399
JOHN:
Can you get any DNA?

05:07.403 --> 05:08.470
Something wrong?

05:08.504 --> 05:10.105
If this is the entry point

05:10.139 --> 05:12.641
to something that killed him,
the DNA indicates

05:12.675 --> 05:15.544
that Brian Barrow was murdered
by seven different people.

05:17.914 --> 05:21.850
JOHN: Alec Govain,
Philip Moses makes seven.

05:21.885 --> 05:23.085
And these are the seven people

05:23.086 --> 05:24.486
whose DNA we found in the wound?

05:24.520 --> 05:25.687
Of the murder victim?

05:27.023 --> 05:29.391
DORIAN: Whatever weapon was used
to kill Brian Barrow

05:29.425 --> 05:31.326
was contaminated by the DNA
of all these people.

05:31.361 --> 05:32.427
MALDONADO:
Did you locate them?

05:32.462 --> 05:34.142
JOHN:
They're all dead.

05:35.647 --> 05:37.008
DORIAN:
They're all listed as dying

05:37.033 --> 05:39.167
of natural causes.
Their hearts stopped.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.404
What do you think's
going on, John?

05:42.438 --> 05:46.008
I don't know, but I doubt
they died of natural causes.

05:46.042 --> 05:47.843
MALDONADO:
Are these people chromes?

05:47.877 --> 05:50.646
They are not, but they must
have been chosen for a reason.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.481
Do you think we stumbled
upon a serial killer?

05:52.515 --> 05:54.549
JOHN: Yeah. If he hadn't
killed the chrome,

05:54.584 --> 05:55.945
we never would have
picked this up.

05:55.952 --> 05:57.419
It would be pretty easy to miss

05:57.453 --> 05:59.054
a little pinprick
on the back of the neck.

05:59.088 --> 06:00.422
What do they have in common?

06:00.456 --> 06:01.657
They all lived in city limits.

06:01.691 --> 06:03.425
Other than that, our algorithms

06:03.459 --> 06:04.726
didn't pick up any patterns.

06:04.761 --> 06:06.261
I see one pattern.

06:06.296 --> 06:09.331
They're all very attractive.

06:18.875 --> 06:21.076
(computer trills, beeping)

06:29.419 --> 06:31.887
(knocking)

06:50.573 --> 06:52.107
Do it again.

06:58.748 --> 07:00.916
We have to stop.

07:00.950 --> 07:05.487
You will do what I want,
or I will call

07:05.522 --> 07:07.222
the police,
and you will go to jail

07:07.257 --> 07:08.557
for the rest of your life

07:08.591 --> 07:11.159
for practicing
with a revoked license.

07:11.194 --> 07:13.295
Your choice.

07:39.022 --> 07:41.823
(machinery whirs)

07:41.858 --> 07:43.992
(gasps)

07:51.067 --> 07:53.702
(screams)

08:01.551 --> 08:03.185
Someone's been talking
to the press

08:03.220 --> 08:04.987
about the chrome murder.

08:05.022 --> 08:06.422
You're kidding. Already?

08:06.456 --> 08:07.923
"Metro Police hunt for
possible serial killer

08:07.958 --> 08:09.225
targeting the city's
young and beautiful."

08:09.259 --> 08:11.894
<i>L.A. Times, New York Times,</i>
<i>AP Deathwire.</i>

08:11.928 --> 08:13.496
My comm's been
ringing off the hook.

08:13.530 --> 08:14.830
We don't even know
anything yet,

08:14.865 --> 08:16.365
and they're already
talking about it.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.434
VALERIE: This kind of news sells.
Chromes have ears

08:18.468 --> 08:20.403
all over the city,
and they take care of their own.

08:20.437 --> 08:22.004
Now, I have a lead.

08:22.039 --> 08:23.873
Two hours before
the victim was killed,

08:23.907 --> 08:26.075
he was at the Electus Club
on Remington.

08:26.109 --> 08:27.677
Killer could have followed him
from the club.

08:27.711 --> 08:29.478
I'll check it out.

08:29.513 --> 08:31.180
Actually, I should go.

08:31.214 --> 08:32.847
Alone.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.183
The Electus is a chrome club.

08:36.119 --> 08:37.986
Of course. Makes sense.

08:38.020 --> 08:39.889
We'll go check in with Rudy.

08:39.923 --> 08:43.092
The bodies of the other victims
are on the way to him.

08:43.126 --> 08:45.287
If they have the same wounds
on the back of their neck,

08:45.295 --> 08:46.896
maybe he can find out
what killed them.

08:48.396 --> 08:50.876
You sure you're up for
going to the chrome club?

08:50.901 --> 08:53.102
Yeah. They may not respect
what I've done with my life,

08:53.136 --> 08:55.504
but they sure respect
what I can do for theirs.

08:55.539 --> 08:57.673
You were the first one they
called when Brian Barrow died.

08:57.708 --> 09:00.188
Only because they're
praying it was murder.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.977
If Brian Barrow died
of natural causes,

09:02.012 --> 09:03.379
the chromes would have
to face something

09:03.413 --> 09:04.747
they never thought possible.

09:04.781 --> 09:07.950
The whole selling point of being
a chrome is a long life.

09:07.985 --> 09:09.318
And perfect health.

09:09.353 --> 09:12.321
People pay a lot of money
for perfection.

09:12.356 --> 09:15.024
Let me know
if you need anything.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.568
Robert, Violet, welcome.

09:25.602 --> 09:27.570
Nice to see you.

09:29.339 --> 09:30.673
I'm sorry.

09:30.707 --> 09:32.074
This is a private club.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.287
I'm sorry, too,
that I'm a member.

09:35.312 --> 09:37.246
Detective Valerie Stahl.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.548
I need to see your surveillance
data from yesterday.

09:39.583 --> 09:41.217
You're a police officer?

09:41.251 --> 09:42.491
You're a chrome.

09:42.519 --> 09:43.986
Yeah, I just
showed you my badge,

09:44.021 --> 09:45.901
and I know you have
20/20 vision.

09:45.922 --> 09:48.224
20/10. And I'm afraid
I can't help you.

09:48.258 --> 09:49.759
I'm investigating the murder

09:49.793 --> 09:51.193
of a chrome named Brian Barrow.

09:51.228 --> 09:53.429
I'm sure you heard about it
on the news.

09:53.463 --> 09:55.064
As general manager,
I'm responsible for protecting

09:55.098 --> 09:56.565
the privacy of our members.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.267
Maybe I'm not making
myself clear.

09:58.301 --> 10:00.469
We believe his killer may have
followed him from here.

10:00.504 --> 10:03.305
In that case, he would show up
on the police drones,

10:03.340 --> 10:04.580
wouldn't he?

10:04.608 --> 10:06.275
Again, this is a private...

10:06.310 --> 10:08.744
Club. Yes, I know, and I'm sure
you're smart enough to know

10:08.779 --> 10:10.146
that I can get a search warrant

10:10.180 --> 10:11.480
in about 45 seconds.

10:11.515 --> 10:12.915
And you must be
smart enough to know

10:12.916 --> 10:14.150
that I can get
Chief Judge Thorne

10:14.184 --> 10:15.718
to quash it
ten seconds after that.

10:15.752 --> 10:17.887
- He's a member.
- I guess I'll just be forced

10:17.921 --> 10:19.422
to cut your police patrol
by 50%.

10:19.456 --> 10:21.457
- Is that supposed to scare me?
- Should.

10:21.491 --> 10:23.192
Based on statistical models,
it'll trigger

10:23.226 --> 10:25.461
a 32% rise in violent attacks
in the area.

10:25.495 --> 10:27.163
Criminals find out we're not
patrolling like we used to,

10:27.197 --> 10:29.131
and they're gonna
take advantage.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.367
Before you know it,
this is a high-incident area.

10:31.401 --> 10:33.035
You know how that works.

10:33.070 --> 10:34.337
We don't need the police.

10:34.371 --> 10:35.492
We have private security.

10:35.505 --> 10:36.939
You mean the guy in the hallway

10:36.974 --> 10:38.975
violating the concealed
weapons statute 49B?

10:39.009 --> 10:42.311
That's a lot to sweep under
the rug, even for Judge Thorne.

10:42.346 --> 10:44.680
- Sorry. Is there a problem?
- Yeah.

10:44.715 --> 10:46.215
Do you have anyone
a little more formidable?

10:46.249 --> 10:47.350
(quiet laugh)

10:47.384 --> 10:48.985
Oh, not me.

10:49.019 --> 10:50.252
I bruise easily.

10:50.287 --> 10:51.687
Chromes don't bruise easily.

10:51.722 --> 10:53.055
Ah, you are

10:53.090 --> 10:55.124
a good police officer.
I'm the owner.

10:56.326 --> 10:57.426
You want to sit?

10:57.461 --> 10:58.861
I'd love to.

10:58.895 --> 11:01.063
Jake Bellman.

11:06.854 --> 11:08.814
DORIAN:
<i>Do you think it was a chrome</i>

11:08.839 --> 11:10.172
that leaked our investigation
to the press?

11:10.207 --> 11:11.447
It's possible.

11:11.475 --> 11:13.142
They got a lot of
pull in this town.

11:13.176 --> 11:14.543
Do you know
how many murders there are

11:14.578 --> 11:15.845
in this city every year?

11:15.879 --> 11:17.813
- 756.
- Yeah, a lot.

11:17.848 --> 11:19.808
One of them turns out to
be a chrome, and suddenly

11:19.816 --> 11:21.884
the whole world stops.

11:21.918 --> 11:23.486
Just proves my point.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.654
What point?

11:24.688 --> 11:26.389
That technology, in this case

11:26.423 --> 11:27.790
chromes,

11:27.824 --> 11:29.225
is driving a wedge
between people.

11:29.259 --> 11:31.360
Making it us versus them.

11:31.395 --> 11:34.196
Technology, like being
holo-blocked on a date.

11:34.231 --> 11:36.098
I thought we agreed
that you had a bad date

11:36.133 --> 11:37.333
because you're boring.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.969
You just can't handle the fact

11:40.003 --> 11:42.204
that technology's
part of the problem.

11:42.239 --> 11:43.773
Cuts a little close
to the titanium.

11:43.807 --> 11:47.043
No, in fact, I'm excited
to embrace this new,

11:47.077 --> 11:49.278
- anti-tech lifestyle.
- Really?

11:49.313 --> 11:50.913
On the way back
to the precinct,

11:50.948 --> 11:53.416
let's replace your robotic leg
with a tree limb.

11:53.450 --> 11:55.751
Or maybe something useful,
like a shovel.

11:55.786 --> 11:57.253
I wish I had a shovel.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.400
JAKE BELLMAN:
<i>I was an attorney at 18,</i>

12:01.425 --> 12:03.192
so I know that detectives

12:03.226 --> 12:05.061
can't cut police patrols.

12:05.095 --> 12:06.362
(quiet laugh)

12:06.396 --> 12:08.297
I'm gonna get that footage

12:08.332 --> 12:10.099
one way or the other.

12:11.268 --> 12:12.802
A chrome was killed.

12:12.836 --> 12:14.270
A member of your club.

12:14.304 --> 12:15.805
One of your own.

12:15.839 --> 12:17.873
We want to know
what the story is.

12:17.908 --> 12:21.077
Okay, well, I want to know
what your story is.

12:21.111 --> 12:23.913
Why, 'cause I'm
a police officer?

12:23.947 --> 12:25.448
I'm a curiosity to you?

12:25.482 --> 12:28.451
No, but I am curious.

12:29.486 --> 12:31.420
It's a long story.

12:31.455 --> 12:32.622
Well, I've got time.

12:32.656 --> 12:35.458
Yeah? You don't need
to get back to your club?

12:35.492 --> 12:37.727
No.

12:37.761 --> 12:40.129
Being a cop, it's
not the strangest

12:40.163 --> 12:41.998
life choice I've
heard for a chrome.

12:42.032 --> 12:44.133
You know,
my brother's a sculptor.

12:44.167 --> 12:47.069
You want to know
what his medium is?

12:47.104 --> 12:48.671
Sure.

12:48.705 --> 12:49.839
You ever heard of a chain saw?

12:49.873 --> 12:51.807
Yes.
Chain saw and lumber.

12:51.842 --> 12:53.476
That's his medium.

12:53.510 --> 12:55.678
Not too many galleries
for something like that.

12:55.712 --> 12:57.813
I think they kind of

12:57.848 --> 13:00.249
overdid his creative gene.

13:00.284 --> 13:02.685
I can imagine you'd know
how my parents felt

13:02.719 --> 13:05.354
having a chrome who didn't
meet their expectations.

13:07.691 --> 13:09.125
You pity him?

13:09.159 --> 13:11.427
(laughs)
No. He pities us.

13:11.461 --> 13:13.429
He's proud to call himself
a sculptor.

13:13.463 --> 13:14.864
He's happy.

13:14.898 --> 13:16.732
What about you?

13:16.767 --> 13:18.301
You proud to call yourself
a police officer?

13:18.335 --> 13:19.869
Yes.

13:19.903 --> 13:23.673
Even in front of other chromes?

13:23.707 --> 13:25.007
(sighs)

13:25.042 --> 13:27.343
I told you it's a long story.

13:27.377 --> 13:29.278
Are you happy?

13:31.214 --> 13:32.682
Yeah, I am.

13:32.716 --> 13:35.351
Every time I get a bad guy.

13:38.689 --> 13:40.957
Then let's get you
that surveillance video.

13:41.595 --> 13:43.635
FEMALE REPORTER:
<i>Updating our top story...</i>

13:43.660 --> 13:46.095
police officials
refuse to confirm

13:46.129 --> 13:49.098
an investigation into
the so-called beauty killer.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.033
But sources close to the probe

13:51.068 --> 13:53.736
say the hunt
for a possible serial murderer

13:53.770 --> 13:56.005
is underway and intensifying.

13:56.039 --> 13:58.274
This is Claire Chang re...

13:58.308 --> 14:00.309
- Rudy.
- Oh! (groans)

14:00.344 --> 14:01.377
You're here.

14:01.411 --> 14:04.013
Finally. (sighs)

14:04.047 --> 14:06.349
Mausoleum dropped off three
of the exhumed bodies

14:06.383 --> 14:07.717
an hour ago.

14:07.751 --> 14:08.784
And...

14:08.819 --> 14:10.353
you were right.

14:10.387 --> 14:12.888
Vir-topsy reveals
that all seven of them

14:12.923 --> 14:16.025
have the same wound, uh,
at the base of the neck.

14:16.059 --> 14:17.460
They were indeed murdered.

14:17.494 --> 14:19.262
Have a look.

14:20.573 --> 14:22.374
JOHN:
Any idea what caused it?

14:22.399 --> 14:23.933
I might, yeah.

14:26.303 --> 14:28.237
Something wrong?

14:29.573 --> 14:32.041
You've got this "beauty killer"
out there,

14:32.075 --> 14:34.043
and I have to hear
about it on the news.

14:34.077 --> 14:35.544
You don't think to warn me?

14:36.813 --> 14:37.780
What's the difference

14:37.814 --> 14:40.583
between me and all seven
of these victims?

14:40.617 --> 14:42.418
Hmm? I'll tell you.

14:42.452 --> 14:44.120
They're all dead.

14:44.154 --> 14:46.088
You're worried
that you're gonna be targeted?

14:46.123 --> 14:48.090
I was a child model.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.559
I-I have
a Rothschild's nose.

14:49.593 --> 14:51.894
My grandmother's
a sixth cousin of the heir.

14:51.929 --> 14:53.729
(laughing)

14:54.998 --> 14:56.399
(clears throat)

15:00.571 --> 15:02.038
It was an oversight, Rudy.

15:02.072 --> 15:03.105
Uh, we're sorry.

15:03.140 --> 15:04.273
Duly noted.

15:04.308 --> 15:05.575
So what did you find?

15:05.609 --> 15:06.943
Something in the wound.

15:06.977 --> 15:09.912
First centimeter,
a very clean insertion point,

15:09.947 --> 15:11.380
consistent with a needle.

15:11.415 --> 15:13.816
After that, it gets weird.
It's irregular.

15:15.786 --> 15:17.853
JOHN:
Looks like tiny

15:17.888 --> 15:19.789
claw marks.
They are.

15:19.823 --> 15:21.090
From nanobots.

15:21.124 --> 15:22.158
Nanobots?

15:22.192 --> 15:23.726
Are you saying

15:23.760 --> 15:25.595
robots were injected
into their necks,

15:25.629 --> 15:28.431
crawled inside their skulls
and killed them?

15:28.465 --> 15:30.266
Yeah, same as Brian Barrow.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.701
In fact, they found

15:31.735 --> 15:33.469
two of these things
still inside him.

15:33.503 --> 15:35.571
I call them Mike and Ike.

15:35.606 --> 15:39.408
Any idea what Mike and Ike
are designed to do?

15:39.443 --> 15:40.676
I'm working on it.

15:46.116 --> 15:48.017
Great work at the Electus Club.

15:48.051 --> 15:50.653
I'm amazed they gave up
the tape without a fight.

15:50.687 --> 15:53.522
Thanks.

15:53.557 --> 15:55.424
What's on your mind?

15:55.459 --> 15:57.026
I'm thinking
maybe it wasn't so bad

15:57.060 --> 15:59.462
being around chromes after all.

15:59.496 --> 16:00.997
The last time
you dealt with chromes,

16:01.031 --> 16:03.165
you were at the shooting range
for three hours.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.001
Poor targets didn't know
what hit them.

16:05.035 --> 16:07.036
Yeah, well...

16:07.070 --> 16:10.339
I guess we can all be surprised.

16:10.374 --> 16:13.109
I spent so much time resenting
where I came from

16:13.143 --> 16:15.344
that I forgot
they're people, too.

16:16.847 --> 16:18.147
You know, sometimes it's nice

16:18.181 --> 16:20.249
to connect with people
who are like you,

16:20.284 --> 16:21.617
who understand you.

16:21.652 --> 16:23.986
Is that why you keep
Kennex around?

16:24.021 --> 16:25.121
No.

16:25.155 --> 16:26.322
I lost a bet.

16:26.356 --> 16:27.890
(laughs)

16:27.925 --> 16:30.192
MAN:
Captain.

16:31.295 --> 16:33.775
Looks like facial rec
has a match.

16:35.365 --> 16:37.266
(cell phone rings)

16:37.301 --> 16:38.501
Stahl.

16:38.535 --> 16:40.436
Hey. I got the footage
from the Electus Club.

16:40.470 --> 16:41.737
I'm sending you a file.

16:41.772 --> 16:42.939
What do you got?

16:42.973 --> 16:45.608
I have Brian Barrow
leaving the club at 5:30.

16:45.642 --> 16:47.009
Keep watching... There!

16:47.044 --> 16:48.277
You see that?

16:48.312 --> 16:49.512
The guy in the coat?

16:49.546 --> 16:51.681
Yup. I think that's our guy.

16:51.715 --> 16:53.516
He follows Barrow
down Remington.

16:53.550 --> 16:54.984
Comes around Sixth Avenue.

16:55.018 --> 16:56.786
And then I get
a facial recognition

16:56.820 --> 16:58.754
from the Bitcoin exchange
across the street.

16:58.789 --> 17:01.357
Comes up as Alec Govain.

17:01.391 --> 17:02.358
That's one of the dead victims.

17:02.392 --> 17:03.392
Correct.

17:03.427 --> 17:04.961
It's not over.

17:04.994 --> 17:06.362
He comes around the next corner.

17:06.396 --> 17:08.731
Now a camera from the cab stand
picks him up.

17:08.765 --> 17:11.000
This time, facial rec reads him
as Todd Paxton.

17:11.034 --> 17:12.367
JOHN:
Another victim.

17:12.402 --> 17:15.404
How could one man
come up on facial rec

17:15.439 --> 17:16.806
as two different people?

17:16.839 --> 17:18.674
I think I have an answer.

17:24.647 --> 17:26.848
There you are.
Thank you.

17:31.822 --> 17:33.623
Can... can I help you?

17:33.657 --> 17:35.791
One large nitro.

17:35.826 --> 17:37.360
Coming right up.

17:37.394 --> 17:39.161
RUDY:
<i>What these nanobots</i>

17:39.196 --> 17:41.998
are programmed to do,
they read and reconstruct

17:42.032 --> 17:43.533
facial tissue.

17:43.567 --> 17:45.001
What did he say?

17:45.035 --> 17:46.769
He said our killer is stealing

17:46.803 --> 17:48.471
<i>parts of people's faces.</i>

17:48.505 --> 17:53.075
Did anyone ever tell you
you have very pretty eyes?

17:53.110 --> 17:56.946
RUDY: <i>This is about
nanobot plastic surgery.</i>

18:07.064 --> 18:09.365
Dr. Randolph Amir.

18:09.399 --> 18:12.134
Excuse me. Excuse me!

18:12.169 --> 18:14.103
(door opens) Stop! You're
not allowed to be in...

18:14.137 --> 18:15.638
Dr. Randolph Amir?

18:15.672 --> 18:17.640
- Yes. - We understand
that you're involved

18:17.674 --> 18:18.974
in the research

18:19.009 --> 18:21.143
into nanobot
facial reconstruction.

18:21.178 --> 18:23.879
Yeah, I'm gonna call you back.

18:23.914 --> 18:26.349
The idea was a new technology.

18:26.383 --> 18:28.551
Nanobot facelifts
on an atomic level.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.553
No more laser nips and tucks.

18:30.587 --> 18:31.987
Microscopic robots programmed

18:32.022 --> 18:34.957
to rebuild the face
from the inside.

18:34.991 --> 18:37.593
Not a single scar.
At least not on the outside.

18:37.627 --> 18:39.428
- And?
- And...

18:39.463 --> 18:41.364
it did not go well.

18:41.398 --> 18:42.798
I wasn't involved in the trials.

18:42.833 --> 18:44.633
But I have to admit I was

18:44.668 --> 18:47.236
one of the first people
to really believe in it.

18:47.270 --> 18:48.371
We still don't know why.

18:48.405 --> 18:50.406
Why what?

18:50.440 --> 18:52.375
It was stopping people's hearts.

18:54.544 --> 18:56.979
On the victim, we found a mark
right at the...

18:57.013 --> 18:58.414
At the base of the skull.

18:58.448 --> 19:00.216
Yeah, the device
that inserts the nanobots

19:00.250 --> 19:02.551
into the neck
is called an actuator.

19:02.586 --> 19:03.853
Uh, let's say

19:03.887 --> 19:06.989
you wanted his perfect nose.

19:07.024 --> 19:08.491
The actuator injects
the nanobots

19:08.525 --> 19:10.192
into the target area.

19:10.227 --> 19:11.994
They're programmed to collect
his genetic blueprint.

19:12.029 --> 19:13.929
Then the actuator
would draw them out again,

19:13.964 --> 19:15.598
and then they'd be
injected into you.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.366
The patient.

19:17.401 --> 19:18.934
Rebuilding your nose
to look exactly like his.

19:18.969 --> 19:20.569
All done from the inside.

19:20.604 --> 19:22.171
The problem was

19:22.205 --> 19:23.839
the electricity caused
by the nanobots

19:23.874 --> 19:25.841
somehow triggered an arrhythmia
in the donor's heart

19:25.876 --> 19:27.243
until it stopped.

19:27.277 --> 19:29.512
The donors were dying.

19:31.882 --> 19:34.617
Some of the recipients
in the study

19:34.651 --> 19:37.353
were substantially disfigured.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.161
Where would someone
find an actuator

19:45.195 --> 19:47.630
to do this procedure?

19:52.335 --> 19:55.104
The nanobots followed
their blueprint perfectly.

19:55.138 --> 19:57.973
You're one step closer
to your ideal face.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.977
Let's keep going.

20:03.347 --> 20:05.981
Now.

20:06.016 --> 20:08.150
When will it ever
be enough, Eric?

20:12.356 --> 20:14.156
You know I know
all about the risks.

20:15.492 --> 20:17.126
You know I don't care.

20:17.160 --> 20:20.997
What you did to me
was worse than dying.

20:21.031 --> 20:23.632
You volunteered for the trials.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.169
Do it.

20:50.761 --> 20:53.062
I don't like what that stuff
does to me.

20:53.096 --> 20:56.465
You know I have to flood
your system with adrenaline,

20:56.500 --> 20:57.700
boost your physical strength,

20:57.734 --> 20:58.801
or you will never survive

20:58.835 --> 21:00.269
another procedure so soon.

21:04.207 --> 21:05.441
(gasps)

21:05.475 --> 21:06.776
(exhales)

21:07.944 --> 21:09.979
(beeps)

21:10.013 --> 21:11.714
(machinery whirring)

21:11.748 --> 21:13.482
(panting)

21:15.519 --> 21:18.020
(groaning)

21:19.222 --> 21:20.790
(groaning continues)

21:20.824 --> 21:22.725
(screaming)

21:25.595 --> 21:27.730
(screaming stops)

21:56.526 --> 21:58.661
They're beautiful.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.334
You know, it's okay
to have flaws, John.

22:05.369 --> 22:07.503
Whatever helps you sleep.

22:07.537 --> 22:09.739
It is said that
the more flaws you have,

22:09.773 --> 22:10.940
the more human you are.

22:10.974 --> 22:12.441
Have I told you how very human

22:12.476 --> 22:14.010
you are lately?

22:14.044 --> 22:15.778
You know, sometimes
when you're doing this,

22:15.812 --> 22:17.780
I'm not really listening.

22:19.149 --> 22:20.750
I don't have that many flaws.

22:20.784 --> 22:21.951
Your left eye
is one half millimeter

22:21.985 --> 22:23.419
higher than the right.

22:23.453 --> 22:25.388
Your nose has an abnormality
one inch from the base.

22:25.422 --> 22:27.323
Yeah, that's from being
punched in the face.

22:27.357 --> 22:28.791
Adds character.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.126
You have a fertile unibrow

22:30.160 --> 22:31.560
that you tend to regularly.

22:31.595 --> 22:33.262
At least it's my face.

22:33.297 --> 22:35.231
I know where I came from.

22:35.265 --> 22:37.366
You're a composite; who
knows where you came from?

22:37.401 --> 22:39.135
(phone rings)
Just think about that.

22:39.169 --> 22:40.536
Kennex.

22:40.570 --> 22:41.804
VALERIE:
Hey, John, where are you?

22:41.838 --> 22:43.939
I'm on my way to Chinatown.

22:43.974 --> 22:45.608
Near the Wall.

22:45.642 --> 22:46.909
We've got another victim.

22:46.943 --> 22:48.244
What have you got?

22:48.278 --> 22:50.413
I have an informant
who knows everything

22:50.447 --> 22:51.681
about the black market.

22:51.715 --> 22:52.915
We're trying to find
an actuator.

22:52.949 --> 22:54.216
What's an actuator?

22:54.251 --> 22:56.185
It's what our guy is using
to kill these people.

22:56.219 --> 22:57.586
I want to see
if I can track one,

22:57.621 --> 22:59.388
find out where he got it.

22:59.423 --> 23:01.624
The latest victim has
the same M.O.

23:01.658 --> 23:03.459
Heart stops, small wound

23:03.493 --> 23:05.695
at the back of the neck.

23:05.729 --> 23:07.997
John, the last seven murders
were each a month apart,

23:08.031 --> 23:10.766
and the last two victims
were within 48 hours.

23:10.801 --> 23:12.268
This guy's accelerating.

23:12.302 --> 23:15.237
We need to stop him.

23:16.673 --> 23:18.153
DORIAN:
You chew with your mouth open,

23:18.175 --> 23:20.276
you lie about putting gel
in your hair,

23:20.310 --> 23:21.277
and you snore.

23:21.311 --> 23:22.545
JOHN:
How do you know I snore?

23:22.579 --> 23:24.447
Your smartbed told me.

23:24.481 --> 23:26.983
Oh, I didn't realize you
two had a relationship.

23:27.017 --> 23:28.284
What else did it tell you?

23:28.318 --> 23:29.585
I don't know.

23:29.619 --> 23:31.988
Whatever it was,
I purged it from my data.

23:32.022 --> 23:33.422
Apparently,
I didn't want to remember.

23:33.457 --> 23:35.358
(sighs) Good.

23:35.392 --> 23:38.794
So what does this informant
look like?

23:38.829 --> 23:40.930
I'll know him when I see him.

23:40.964 --> 23:43.132
(crowd cheering)

23:51.008 --> 23:54.443
I hate to see robots used
for entertainment like this.

23:54.478 --> 23:56.612
(cheering continues)

24:07.190 --> 24:09.692
(cheering continues)

24:17.167 --> 24:20.803
You know a guy called Dicarlo?

24:21.705 --> 24:23.406
No.

24:28.378 --> 24:30.858
DORIAN:
What are you doing, man?

24:33.350 --> 24:35.384
Hey, Dicarlo.

24:36.753 --> 24:39.221
Damn it, Kennex!

24:40.557 --> 24:42.558
I thought you were dead.

24:42.592 --> 24:44.126
Glad to see me?

24:44.161 --> 24:46.896
Do you have any idea
how expensive these things are?

24:46.930 --> 24:48.097
Huh?!

24:48.131 --> 24:49.832
Dorian, Dicarlo.

24:49.866 --> 24:51.534
Dicarlo, Dorian.

24:57.427 --> 24:59.628
(crowd cheering)

24:59.653 --> 25:01.587
That was my favorite exosuit.

25:01.622 --> 25:03.923
Super comfy on the inside

25:03.957 --> 25:06.225
and sweet like pie
on the outside.

25:06.260 --> 25:08.094
Look, I need your help.

25:08.128 --> 25:10.797
I want to find something
called an actuator.

25:10.831 --> 25:11.964
That's what it looks like.

25:13.834 --> 25:15.535
Look at it.

25:15.569 --> 25:17.804
- I am looking.
- Look at it like you mean it.

25:17.838 --> 25:19.872
It's used in
illegal high-end

25:19.907 --> 25:21.107
plastic surgery.

25:21.141 --> 25:22.375
Plastic surgery?

25:22.409 --> 25:23.409
Yeah, the kind that kills

25:23.443 --> 25:24.744
the person whose face you want.

25:24.778 --> 25:26.913
You know where I can
find something like that?

25:26.947 --> 25:28.948
What do I get out of it?

25:28.982 --> 25:31.551
Look, you either help us out
of the goodness of your heart,

25:31.585 --> 25:34.020
or I'll get my robot to
toss you and your suit

25:34.054 --> 25:35.421
over the Wall.

25:37.658 --> 25:39.358
Okay, look,

25:39.393 --> 25:41.794
there's a guy,
and if there's heat on you,

25:41.829 --> 25:43.963
he can change your face
so facial rec

25:43.997 --> 25:45.465
won't recognize you.

25:45.499 --> 25:46.866
Is this guy a doctor?

25:46.900 --> 25:48.601
I don't know. Probably.

25:48.635 --> 25:49.735
Where do we find him?

25:49.770 --> 25:51.771
In the East Term.

25:55.943 --> 25:58.411
(sirens wailing)

25:59.880 --> 26:02.915
(computer chirping)

26:04.017 --> 26:07.153
(beeping)

26:08.222 --> 26:10.857
(knocking)

26:10.891 --> 26:12.792
JOHN:
Police. Open up.

26:15.429 --> 26:17.663
- Police. Open up.
- No, no, no.

26:25.873 --> 26:27.440
(bellowing)

26:27.474 --> 26:30.309
(grunting)

26:32.679 --> 26:34.347
A little help here?!

26:35.082 --> 26:36.949
(choking)

26:38.585 --> 26:41.888
(gasping)

26:41.922 --> 26:43.456
He's gone into cardiac arrest.

26:43.490 --> 26:45.391
(electrical whirring)

26:53.267 --> 26:54.634
(panting)

26:54.668 --> 26:56.502
DORIAN:
He's dead.

26:56.537 --> 27:00.006
Looks like he took a shot
of synthetic adrenaline.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.707
He was freakishly strong.

27:01.742 --> 27:04.444
Thought he was gonna
fight his way out.

27:04.478 --> 27:06.746
Whatever this guy was into,
he didn't want to get caught.

27:06.780 --> 27:08.514
You think?

27:10.083 --> 27:12.018
His name is Dr. Curtis McCann.

27:12.052 --> 27:13.686
Was.

27:13.720 --> 27:17.323
He was one of the 20 doctors
involved in the nanobot trials.

27:17.357 --> 27:18.658
He lost his medical license

27:18.692 --> 27:20.226
for hiding the side effects.

27:20.260 --> 27:21.861
(computer chirping)

27:21.895 --> 27:25.932
Dorian, here's the guy
we're looking for.

27:27.968 --> 27:29.235
This face is a composite

27:29.269 --> 27:30.703
of the specific features
of the victims.

27:30.737 --> 27:33.339
There are ten parts
to this facial construction.

27:33.373 --> 27:35.608
These are the
facial features he wants.

27:35.642 --> 27:37.110
There have only been
nine victims so far.

27:37.144 --> 27:39.512
Means there's still
one out there.

27:39.546 --> 27:42.749
Can you extrapolate
who the next victim's gonna be?

27:44.418 --> 27:47.286
According to facial rec,
this looks like the next victim.

27:47.321 --> 27:50.189
Looks like he selected
the cheekbone structure.

27:51.091 --> 27:53.426
Stahl, we think we know

27:53.460 --> 27:56.596
who the next victim's
going to be.

28:00.267 --> 28:02.101
Freeze!
This is the police.

28:02.136 --> 28:03.136
Sweep the perimeter.

28:03.137 --> 28:04.303
Jonathan Geddes?

28:04.338 --> 28:05.505
What the hell is this?

28:05.539 --> 28:06.939
(sighs)

28:06.974 --> 28:08.908
We're here to protect you.

28:11.478 --> 28:12.779
What have you got?

28:12.813 --> 28:13.880
Nothing yet.

28:13.914 --> 28:15.114
We've got a plainclothes
downstairs,

28:15.149 --> 28:16.916
<i>but we're ready for him up here</i>

28:16.950 --> 28:19.852
<i>if he makes it past him.</i>

28:19.887 --> 28:21.454
Any more info
on the killer's I.D.?

28:21.488 --> 28:23.623
We subpoenaed the insurance
company to get the names

28:23.657 --> 28:25.758
of the patients in the trials.

28:25.793 --> 28:28.027
Might take a few days
to get through the red tape.

28:28.061 --> 28:29.382
VALERIE:
<i>We don't have that long.</i>

28:29.396 --> 28:32.231
JOHN:
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

28:37.404 --> 28:39.038
(phone ringing)

28:39.072 --> 28:41.174
Hold on a minute.

28:43.043 --> 28:45.144
(ringing continues)

28:49.283 --> 28:50.550
Who is it?

28:50.584 --> 28:52.452
The call is scrambled.
Answer it.

28:52.486 --> 28:53.886
And say what?
I don't know.

28:53.921 --> 28:55.521
Just-just use his voice,
you know,

28:55.556 --> 28:56.789
like you... like you do mine.

28:56.824 --> 28:58.458
I have never heard his voice.

28:58.492 --> 29:00.653
I've only heard him grunt
when he was kicking your ass.

29:00.661 --> 29:02.361
(ringing continues)

29:06.900 --> 29:08.935
(ringing stops)
(sighs) Terrific.

29:08.969 --> 29:11.270
JOHN:
Hey, I'm back. Sorry.

29:11.305 --> 29:14.140
He's not gonna give up
when he's just one piece away.

29:14.174 --> 29:16.042
JOHN: <i> He's been selecting
his victims carefully.</i>

29:16.076 --> 29:18.277
<i>He'll find someone else</i>
<i>with the feature he needs.</i>

29:18.312 --> 29:20.580
<i>It's just a matter of time.</i>

with those features.

30:31.417 --> 30:33.885
VALERIE: They have one
other thing in common.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.399
They all live in
the Lower Term.

30:36.422 --> 30:40.058
Well, that narrows it down
to half a million... people.

30:42.795 --> 30:44.095
MALDONADO:
What is it?

30:46.132 --> 30:48.366
Take a look at my driver's
license. What do you see?

30:48.401 --> 30:50.602
A terrible picture.
You should have it redone.

30:50.636 --> 30:52.904
Yeah, I tried, but you have
to wait in line for hours

30:52.938 --> 30:56.574
to get the new 3-D pictures,
which all of these people have.

30:56.609 --> 30:59.310
Maybe where they lived
is the pattern after all.

30:59.345 --> 31:00.879
Overlay the DMV district.

31:00.913 --> 31:03.982
DORIAN: They all fall
in the same district.

31:04.016 --> 31:05.784
Do you think the guy
works at the DMV?

31:05.818 --> 31:07.485
VALERIE: That's the only
connection we have.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.787

I got something.

32:27.633 --> 32:28.733
What'd you find?

32:28.768 --> 32:30.402
I think I found him.

32:30.436 --> 32:31.936
He did work at the DMV.

32:31.971 --> 32:33.505
His name is Eric Latham.

32:33.539 --> 32:35.206
JOHN:
Can we be sure it's him?

32:35.241 --> 32:36.207
He went on disability

32:36.242 --> 32:38.076
September 9, a year ago.

32:38.110 --> 32:39.644
That's when the trials
were beginning.

32:39.678 --> 32:42.180
Do you think he still
has access to the DMV files?

32:42.214 --> 32:44.683
He could. Technically,
he's still an employee.

32:44.717 --> 32:47.652
He's had 32 surgeries
in the last seven years.

32:47.687 --> 32:50.355
MALDONADO: Why would he
volunteer for these trials?

32:50.389 --> 32:52.691
He looks perfectly normal.

32:52.725 --> 32:54.192
And there's nothing
in his medical history

32:54.226 --> 32:55.560
that shows he was
disfigured, either.

32:55.594 --> 32:58.063
<i>Could be dysmorphic disorder.</i>

32:58.097 --> 33:00.398
<i>He sees images of perfection</i>
<i>all around him,</i>

<i>and the more he compares</i>
<i>himself to those images,</i>

33:02.868 --> 33:04.803
<i>the worse he feels</i>
<i>about himself,</i>

33:04.837 --> 33:06.304
<i>and he's compelled</i>
<i>to take the steps</i>

33:06.339 --> 33:07.439
to mitigate the disaster

33:07.473 --> 33:08.973
he sees in the mirror.

33:09.008 --> 33:10.542
That's not a disaster.

33:10.576 --> 33:12.177
VALERIE:
<i>To him, it is.</i>

33:12.211 --> 33:14.211

<i>his version of perfect.</i>

33:19.352 --> 33:21.052
Go get him.

33:21.087 --> 33:22.454
Good job.

33:37.169 --> 33:39.104
OFFICER:
Bedroom's clear!

33:39.138 --> 33:40.305
Bathroom's clear.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.741
Clear!

33:44.443 --> 33:46.644
He's gone.

33:46.679 --> 33:48.146
OFFICER: Code four...
area is secure.

33:50.016 --> 33:51.650
His terminal's encrypted.

33:53.416 --> 33:55.896
JOHN:
What do you got?

33:55.921 --> 33:57.401
DORIAN: He's using a
composite picture

33:57.423 --> 33:59.591
of his ideal face
as his avatar.

33:59.625 --> 34:01.993
His only correspondence
was with one woman.

34:02.028 --> 34:03.595
Online.
They chatted every day.

34:03.629 --> 34:05.130
JOHN:
Who is she?

34:05.164 --> 34:06.464
DORIAN:
Her screen name is Judy.

34:06.499 --> 34:07.866
They communicated this morning.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.801
They've been corresponding
for months.

34:09.835 --> 34:11.936
He told her he lives in Arizona.

34:11.971 --> 34:13.138
They've never met,

34:13.172 --> 34:15.507
but he's using his real name.

34:15.541 --> 34:17.175
I don't think she's a victim.

34:17.208 --> 34:19.143
He's perfecting
his face for her.

34:19.178 --> 34:20.612
JOHN: Have you got her address?

34:20.646 --> 34:23.047
All I have is a screen name.

34:23.081 --> 34:25.382
With a little time,
I think I can track her

34:25.418 --> 34:27.898
through her IP address.

34:30.422 --> 34:31.856
She a brunette?

34:31.891 --> 34:33.123
Yes.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.360
Yes, she is.

34:35.393 --> 34:37.295
I think I found her.

34:38.597 --> 34:40.532
The food cartridges
are in the third bag.

34:40.565 --> 34:42.132
Do you need any help, Judy?

34:42.168 --> 34:43.902
No, I'm fine.
Thank you, Phil.

34:43.936 --> 34:45.270
Okay.

34:45.304 --> 34:47.172
See you next time.

34:54.013 --> 34:56.081
(door closes) ERIC: Judy...

34:56.114 --> 34:57.549
Judy, it's Eric.

34:58.751 --> 35:00.285
Eric?

35:00.319 --> 35:02.654
I didn't mean to scare you.

35:02.688 --> 35:06.725
Your, uh...
your door was open.

35:08.227 --> 35:10.061
I meant it as a surprise.

35:10.096 --> 35:11.896
Coming early, I mean.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.068
You're beautiful.

35:17.937 --> 35:20.071
Oh...

35:22.808 --> 35:24.943
I'm sorry about the bandage.

35:24.977 --> 35:26.644
Truth is,

35:26.679 --> 35:30.215
I didn't want you
to see me like this.

35:30.249 --> 35:32.217
But I can assure you

35:32.251 --> 35:34.786
I won't be wearing it for long.

35:36.155 --> 35:38.623
I'm sure you're beautiful.

35:38.658 --> 35:41.459
As beautiful as the feelings

35:41.494 --> 35:44.062
and the conversations
we've shared.

35:44.096 --> 35:47.732
But I've kept
something from you.

35:49.969 --> 35:51.436
What?

36:08.788 --> 36:10.455
You're blind.

36:10.489 --> 36:12.590
(sighs)

36:14.660 --> 36:16.895
I should have told you.

36:16.929 --> 36:18.430
I-I struggled with it
every time,

36:18.464 --> 36:20.565
but I just...

36:22.268 --> 36:23.902
I-I just liked you so much,

36:23.936 --> 36:26.171
and-and you liked me,
and I didn't want it to end,

36:26.205 --> 36:28.340
and I was afraid it would.

36:30.910 --> 36:34.279
If you could love me...

36:34.313 --> 36:36.614
then you would see
that I am the same person

36:36.649 --> 36:38.950
that you began to know
and care about.

36:40.219 --> 36:41.620
I just felt

36:41.654 --> 36:43.421
that you were...

36:43.456 --> 36:45.590
as lonely as I was.

36:48.094 --> 36:49.928
Was I wrong?

36:54.600 --> 36:56.701
No.

37:05.544 --> 37:07.312
I don't care about your face,

37:07.346 --> 37:09.347
or-or what you look like.
I just...

37:10.850 --> 37:13.718
I'm so happy
that we found each other.
