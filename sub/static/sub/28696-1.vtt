- Come on.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.113
Coming.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.716
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.

01:14.718 --> 01:17.952
- Can I have an Americano,
please.

01:17.954 --> 01:18.953
What do you want?

01:18.955 --> 01:21.825
- I'll just have black coffee.
- Two Americanos.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.324
Forty-eight kroners
for a cup of coffee?

01:24.326 --> 01:25.328
Yeah.

01:25.828 --> 01:28.195
- Are you gonna eat?
- No, I'm not.

01:28.197 --> 01:30.767
Can I have
a prosciutto sandwich.

01:31.368 --> 01:33.500
And can you put some of those
tomatoes in there?

01:33.502 --> 01:34.603
Of course.

01:44.513 --> 01:46.880
Why didn't you clean the car?
It's disgusting!

01:46.882 --> 01:47.814
What's your problem?

01:47.816 --> 01:49.616
Everything you need
is just right here.

01:49.618 --> 01:51.485
Where? Where's the address?
I don't know.

01:51.487 --> 01:53.489
I mean, have a look.
Check the file.

01:54.356 --> 01:55.524
There you go.
Right there.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.625
- Feed the computer.
- Feed it?

01:58.627 --> 02:00.396
- Is it Ulrich? No
- No.

02:01.230 --> 02:02.362
- Mads?
- Yeah that's it.

02:02.364 --> 02:03.365
All right.

02:04.532 --> 02:06.767
You better clean this car,
I'm not doing it this time.

02:06.769 --> 02:08.300
- Right.
- No, I'm serious.

02:08.301 --> 02:10.638
You sound like my nagging wife!

02:11.006 --> 02:12.641
Speak of the devil.

02:13.275 --> 02:15.244
- Hi, Honey, you're on speaker
- <i>Okay.</i>

02:15.477 --> 02:16.611
Hi, Hanne.

02:17.245 --> 02:18.428
Hi, Christian.

02:19.248 --> 02:20.747
Honey, could you swing
by the pharmacy

02:20.749 --> 02:22.383
and pick up my medicines
on your way home?

02:22.785 --> 02:24.451
- Yeah, No problem
- Thanks.

02:24.453 --> 02:26.753
- Can I come to dinner tonight?
- <i>Yes, of course.</i>

02:26.755 --> 02:28.790
- What are we having?
- Um...

02:29.625 --> 02:32.593
I'll make Lai cook
some of her spicy chicken.

02:32.795 --> 02:34.897
<i>Great, we'll see
you after work then.</i>

02:35.463 --> 02:38.199
- Yeah, be careful out there.
- Yeah, I will.

02:39.568 --> 02:41.602
- Everything all right?
- Mm-hm, fine.

02:43.504 --> 02:44.537
Absolutely fine.

02:55.817 --> 02:57.918
It's a really good deal.
And if we go for it now

02:57.920 --> 02:59.719
- we can get it even cheaper.
- Uh-huh.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.987
- It's a four-star hotel...
- Yeah.

03:00.989 --> 03:02.421
- ...in the Canaries.
- Yeah.

03:02.423 --> 03:03.757
It will do you good.

03:03.759 --> 03:05.057
It is always miserable here
in January.

03:05.059 --> 03:07.593
Yeah, tell that to Lars, he's
the one that doesn't want to go.

03:07.595 --> 03:08.861
- Why don't you wanna go?
- Come on,

03:08.863 --> 03:10.063
I can sit on a beach
when I'm old.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.764
- I told her she can go alone.
- Yeah, he'll go with you.

03:11.766 --> 03:12.665
No, I won't go,

03:12.667 --> 03:14.366
- she can go alone.
- Oh, yes, you'll go.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.303
No, I won't!

03:15.305 --> 03:16.936
- You need the sun
- That is so true.

03:16.938 --> 03:18.841
Thanks a lot. Who is that?

03:20.575 --> 03:22.742
- I should get going.
- Oh, oh.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.078
- Someone has a date.
- You sound like my mother.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.645
I sort of am.

03:26.647 --> 03:28.379
That makes Lars
my sort of father.

03:28.381 --> 03:30.082
No, it doesn't.
You should be going, right?

03:30.084 --> 03:31.751
We are going to work tomorrow,
four to twelve.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.486
He's so sweet,
he worries about my bedtime.

03:33.488 --> 03:35.588
- Always.
- Could you be a darling

03:35.590 --> 03:37.322
and take out
the garbage for me, please?

03:37.324 --> 03:38.524
Of course.
You pick me up?

03:38.526 --> 03:41.461
- Yeah, make sure you are there
- See you guys.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.565
Lars?

04:21.035 --> 04:22.569
Lars?

04:44.991 --> 04:46.592
Shhhh.

05:02.408 --> 05:05.511
- What is going on?
- I have to go to work.

05:05.946 --> 05:08.478
You're not going anywhere.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.783
No, you are not!

05:11.985 --> 05:13.717
Really?

05:13.719 --> 05:14.955
No.

05:16.555 --> 05:18.089
I have to go.

05:18.091 --> 05:19.692
You can let yourself out, okay?

05:28.901 --> 05:30.604
Come here.

05:40.512 --> 05:42.682
Really?

06:10.175 --> 06:13.113
Sorry.

06:28.060 --> 06:31.629
You look like shit.
Didn't get any sleep?

06:34.532 --> 06:38.201
- Did you?
- I slept enough.

06:38.203 --> 06:40.870
<i>...report
of a domestic dispute</i>

06:40.872 --> 06:41.838
<i>on Thekla street.</i>

06:41.840 --> 06:44.442
- <i>Anyone in the vicinity...</i>
- No.

06:46.577 --> 06:48.180
- Yes, we are.
- Oh, come on.

06:48.647 --> 06:49.814
Let someone else do it.

06:51.650 --> 06:53.917
Ten-four, Ten-four,
Nine-six-four-three-one,

06:53.919 --> 06:56.819
- we are on our way
- <i>Copy.</i>

06:56.821 --> 07:00.558
<i>The address is 18,
Thekla Street, 6th floor.</i>

07:00.926 --> 07:06.131
<i>Name is Farouk Hares.
H - A - R - E - S.</i>

08:00.918 --> 08:02.920
You should take
Hanne to the Canaries.

08:03.588 --> 08:05.021
You know, take some time off.

08:05.023 --> 08:06.657
- Kick back, relax
- Look,

08:06.858 --> 08:09.994
we can crab a cup of coffee
after work then we can talk.

08:28.311 --> 08:29.780
- Hold on.
- What?

08:30.048 --> 08:32.283
We're on the wrong floor,
we need to go back down.

08:55.105 --> 08:57.874
Hey, Farouk.
Hey. Hey, buddy...

08:59.709 --> 09:00.944
what's that on your shoes?

09:03.046 --> 09:04.179
Hmm?

09:16.293 --> 09:17.894
Stay down.

09:25.302 --> 09:26.968
Take it easy.

09:26.970 --> 09:29.036
Okay, Farouk,
I'm gonna stand you up now.

09:29.038 --> 09:31.341
All right.
Okay here we go.

09:31.774 --> 09:33.274
Just stand there

09:33.276 --> 09:35.776
Now, take it easy.
Just stay there.

09:35.778 --> 09:37.678
Go check on
the wife, she might be hurt.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.648
Come on, that's top floor.

09:40.149 --> 09:41.318
Why don't you do it?

09:42.719 --> 09:44.687
Take it easy! Huh?

09:45.322 --> 09:46.255
Lars.

09:46.989 --> 09:47.990
What?

09:49.191 --> 09:50.226
Give me your gun.

09:51.161 --> 09:52.759
- My gun?
- Yeah.

09:52.761 --> 09:54.231
- Why?
- I left mine at home.

09:54.997 --> 09:56.333
I know.
I know

09:58.067 --> 09:59.068
All right.

09:59.969 --> 10:02.872
Here you go,
be careful right?

10:11.013 --> 10:13.313
You stay there and be quiet.

10:16.485 --> 10:19.822
This is Lars Hansen,
nine-six-four-three-seven.

10:25.793 --> 10:26.996
No.

10:29.431 --> 10:32.668
What?
No problem I'll wait.

10:43.111 --> 10:44.213
Mrs. Hares?

10:47.749 --> 10:48.883
Mrs. Hares?

10:51.086 --> 10:53.087
Mrs. Hares, it's the police.

11:29.023 --> 11:31.459
Yeah. All right.

11:41.536 --> 11:44.038
We just apprehended a man
on Thekla Street.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.508
No,
I haven't checked his ID yet.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.140
Hold on.

12:22.477 --> 12:24.112
Are you Farouk Hares?

12:31.251 --> 12:32.520
Hmm?

12:46.566 --> 12:48.001
Lars!

12:54.375 --> 12:55.575
Lars!

13:16.062 --> 13:17.264
Lars?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.834
Fuck!

13:22.168 --> 13:24.035
- Hold on. Hold on.
- He stabbed me.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.538
Hello? Officer down
I need an ambulance

13:26.540 --> 13:28.205
- to 18 Thekla Street,
- He had a knife.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.344
4th floor and send backup.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.549
Okay. Look at me.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.050
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Yeah.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.284
An ambulance is coming.

13:40.286 --> 13:43.588
I'm fine.
I'm absolutely fine, okay.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.158
- You okay? You sure?
- Yeah. Fine.

13:46.425 --> 13:50.029
Go get him. All right?
Just go get the fucker.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.257
- You okay?
- Go get him.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.660
All right?

15:00.132 --> 15:03.302
[suspenseful music playing

18:10.653 --> 18:12.788
Thank you. Jacob?

18:16.292 --> 18:17.558
What?

18:17.560 --> 18:19.693
They said that
he's got brain damage

18:19.695 --> 18:22.897
and, um, they don't know
if he's gonna wake up again.

18:22.899 --> 18:24.133
Of course he will.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.168
What happened, Christian?

18:26.469 --> 18:28.669
I know, I understand. Shh.

18:28.671 --> 18:30.339
What happened?

18:32.909 --> 18:34.910
Oh, my God.

18:42.618 --> 18:44.351
Where was he stabbed?

18:44.353 --> 18:46.219
He wasn't stabbed.
His throat was slit.

18:46.221 --> 18:48.554
- Who got stabbed?
- Lars Hansen.

18:48.556 --> 18:49.790
Couple of hours ago.

18:49.792 --> 18:51.493
Out on Thekla Street.

18:52.327 --> 18:54.730
- Is he alive though?
- Barely.

19:48.415 --> 19:51.318
I should have stayed with him.
I made the wrong decision.

19:53.055 --> 19:55.488
Why didn't you just shoot,
I mean it's...

19:55.490 --> 19:57.225
I left my gun in the car.

19:57.992 --> 20:00.793
What? You left your gun
in your car?

20:00.795 --> 20:03.295
That van.
I ran the license plates.

20:03.297 --> 20:05.933
- They don't exist.
- We know, we're on it.

20:05.935 --> 20:07.332
What about
the crime scene techs?

20:07.334 --> 20:08.267
Did they find anything yet?

20:08.269 --> 20:09.568
You know misplacing
your service weapon

20:09.570 --> 20:11.905
- is grounds for suspension?
- I didn't <i>misplace</i> it.

20:11.907 --> 20:14.707
- I left it in the car.
- It is not up to me to decide

20:14.709 --> 20:16.778
what misplaced means..

20:18.813 --> 20:19.814
I know.

20:22.449 --> 20:23.651
Fucking hell.

20:26.654 --> 20:28.890
We lifted a perfect set
of prints.

20:30.457 --> 20:31.693
Ezra Tarsi.

20:32.494 --> 20:33.995
Thirty-eight. Born in Libya

20:34.863 --> 20:36.597
His family
were Coptic Christians.

20:36.998 --> 20:38.500
Came to Denmark as a kid.

20:39.533 --> 20:41.968
Family were granted citizenship
in '88.

20:41.970 --> 20:45.006
Did his military service here.
Special forces.

20:45.706 --> 20:48.475
Married in the late 90's.
Two kids.

20:49.409 --> 20:51.376
Four years ago,
after Gaddafi's fall,

20:51.378 --> 20:54.113
his parents went back to Libya.
His father is a doctor,

20:54.115 --> 20:56.448
he wanted to help rebuild
the country.

20:56.450 --> 20:57.785
He shouldn't have done that.

21:00.621 --> 21:03.356
We believe Ezra's father
is 3rd from the right.

21:05.492 --> 21:06.627
Here.

21:08.529 --> 21:10.999
We got the list of names
from the Americans.

21:14.368 --> 21:16.370
- From the FBI?
- Yeah.

21:16.703 --> 21:19.938
When we went to Ezra's home,
it was like they'd just left.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.973
There was still milk
in the fridge,

21:21.975 --> 21:24.045
clothes in the drier
and even a cat.

21:24.778 --> 21:26.513
They just took off.

22:38.952 --> 22:40.784
<i>Hi,
you called Hanne and Lars.</i>

22:40.786 --> 22:42.622
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

23:01.040 --> 23:02.174
Hanne?

23:02.608 --> 23:04.476
It's Alexandra Boe.

23:06.846 --> 23:09.013
- Hi, Alex.
- <i>Hi, um,</i>

23:09.015 --> 23:10.482
<i>Wold put me
on the Lars Hansen case</i>

23:10.683 --> 23:12.482
and I just thought
I'd get a head start.

23:12.484 --> 23:13.451
<i>Okay.</i>

23:14.388 --> 23:15.818
So, you were there
when he was attacked?

23:15.820 --> 23:17.089
<i>No. No, I was, um,</i>

23:17.556 --> 23:19.125
<i>I was upstairs,
in the crime scene.</i>

23:19.892 --> 23:22.627
Lars was down on the 4th floor
with the suspect.

23:23.663 --> 23:25.561
I think he was on the phone
with command

23:25.563 --> 23:27.532
when he was attacked.
It happened quickly.

23:29.902 --> 23:32.138
So, you don't think
he was in a lot of pain?

23:34.073 --> 23:36.506
I think it hurts being stabbed.

23:36.508 --> 23:38.044
Yes, of course.

23:39.644 --> 23:42.046
- Why did you leave him?
- <i>What?</i>

23:42.048 --> 23:44.183
- Why did you leave him?
- <i>I...</i>

23:44.684 --> 23:45.917
<i>I didn't.</i>

23:46.518 --> 23:48.753
<i>Lars wanted me to go
after Tarzi.</i>

23:49.187 --> 23:50.921
<i>We spoke.
He was totally there.</i>

23:50.923 --> 23:53.791
<i>I mean, none of us knew
how deep the cut was.</i>

23:53.793 --> 23:56.128
He wanted me to go
and I went.

23:57.262 --> 23:58.530
Okay?

24:02.534 --> 24:03.600
Hello?

24:04.035 --> 24:05.204
<i>Yes.</i>

24:06.271 --> 24:07.904
<i>Look, there's a meeting
tomorrow at 9,</i>

24:07.906 --> 24:09.107
<i>let's take it from there.</i>

24:10.208 --> 24:11.177
Fine.

24:11.507 --> 24:13.576
<i>Christian,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

24:13.578 --> 24:16.915
<i>How are you doing?
You fought the attacker.</i>

24:18.817 --> 24:20.051
I'll see you tomorrow.

24:26.157 --> 24:27.558
Fuck!

25:46.937 --> 25:49.773
Well, haven't you got yourself
into a fine mess?

25:51.107 --> 25:53.811
You ever killed
a police officer before?

25:56.780 --> 25:59.980
If he survives,
and I'm betting he won't,

25:59.982 --> 26:01.883
he will likely spend
the rest of his life

26:01.885 --> 26:04.786
drooling in an institution,
which even here in Denmark

26:04.788 --> 26:06.923
will earn you a hefty stretch.

26:09.892 --> 26:11.328
Can you talk?

26:13.763 --> 26:15.798
When I have something to say.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.966
So, it's just a matter
of time, then.

26:18.968 --> 26:22.638
Which you people
never have enough of.

26:23.006 --> 26:26.076
You people?

26:27.677 --> 26:29.679
So, you know who we are?

26:31.948 --> 26:34.817
- CIA.
- Ahh, correct.

26:45.161 --> 26:47.697
You let me know
when you're ready to talk.

27:11.854 --> 27:13.990
<i>Your name is Musa, right?</i>

27:16.225 --> 27:19.426
I'm Joe.
Do you speak English, Musa?

27:19.428 --> 27:20.860
- Yes.
- Yes?

27:20.862 --> 27:22.763
Speak up, Musa,
do you speak English?

27:22.765 --> 27:24.498
- Yes
- Yes. Are you scared?

27:24.500 --> 27:25.434
A little.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.468
A little?
You got nothing to be scared of,

27:27.470 --> 27:29.038
I'm just gonna ask you
a couple of questions. Okay?

27:29.905 --> 27:32.708
Musa!
Look at me. Okay?

27:41.450 --> 27:43.051
<i>You know what kind of knife
this is?</i>

27:43.986 --> 27:45.353
<i>This is a knife
for killing people.</i>

27:46.054 --> 27:47.323
<i>It's taken many lives.</i>

27:47.889 --> 27:49.392
<i>It has done
some terrible things.</i>

27:49.891 --> 27:52.326
It's cut people's throats.
Chopped their fingers off.

27:52.328 --> 27:53.362
Stabbed them.

28:00.168 --> 28:02.037
<i>Ever stabbed anybody, Musa?</i>

28:03.805 --> 28:04.940
<i>You wanna hold it?</i>

28:07.175 --> 28:08.311
<i>Come on, feel it.</i>

28:11.414 --> 28:14.049
<i>Musa, I want you to hold it.
Pick up the knife.</i>

28:14.417 --> 28:17.320
<i>Pick up the knife, Musa.
Pick it up.</i>

28:19.254 --> 28:21.821
Musa, I want you to pick it up,
hold it.

28:21.823 --> 28:23.058
Pick up the knife.

28:27.929 --> 28:30.095
<i>I also have some pictures here</i>

28:30.097 --> 28:32.734
<i>of the man who was killed
by that knife.</i>

28:33.801 --> 28:35.036
<i>You want to see them?</i>

28:41.209 --> 28:43.076
<i>Pretty gruesome, isn't it?</i>

28:43.078 --> 28:44.547
<i>Ever seen anything
like that before?</i>

28:48.816 --> 28:52.318
<i>I have a picture here of t
he man who did kill these...</i>

28:52.320 --> 28:53.488
Stop it!

29:01.529 --> 29:02.464
Yeah?

29:03.130 --> 29:04.399
I think we're done here.

29:09.837 --> 29:11.304
Farouk Hares

29:11.306 --> 29:13.839
was the proverbial
invisible man.

29:13.841 --> 29:15.841
Proprietor of the most
reasonable

29:15.843 --> 29:18.779
and highly regarded
grocery store at Nørrebro,

29:19.046 --> 29:21.513
a Danish citizen,
paid his taxes,

29:21.515 --> 29:24.251
faithfully sending money
back to his family in Libya.

29:24.518 --> 29:27.119
He went to the mosque
once a week, nothing suspicious.

29:27.121 --> 29:29.887
Until now.
He was tortured and killed.

29:29.889 --> 29:31.557
His apartment was filled
with guns and explosives

29:31.559 --> 29:33.959
and clearly he had
some information Tarzi wanted.

29:33.961 --> 29:34.926
Not necessarily,

29:34.928 --> 29:36.862
it could be revenge
for something or other.

29:36.864 --> 29:38.598
You know, Farouk's grandfather
might have done something

29:38.600 --> 29:40.932
to Ezra's grandfather.
You know we... we never forget.

29:40.934 --> 29:42.903
True.
But why torture him?

29:43.638 --> 29:45.205
Sometimes,
killing is not enough.

29:46.006 --> 29:48.107
There's gotta be some pain too,
you know.

29:48.375 --> 29:51.945
We all want to be
on Omar's good side, obviously.

29:52.646 --> 29:56.315
Among his tomatoes,
we found a Scorpio machine gun,

29:56.317 --> 29:59.351
9.3 kilos of explosives,
military grade.

29:59.353 --> 30:01.920
We're gonna release
the news of his murder today,

30:01.922 --> 30:05.059
obviously without mentioning
the gun or the explosives.

30:05.359 --> 30:06.325
Any thoughts?

30:06.327 --> 30:07.392
You might wanna
check out

30:07.394 --> 30:10.162
- Prima Vegitales in Spain.
- Yeah, Spanish police

30:10.164 --> 30:11.631
is keeping an eye on them.

30:11.633 --> 30:14.301
Also, Ezra Tarsi was abducted.

30:16.637 --> 30:18.903
That might just mean
he wasn't acting alone.

30:18.905 --> 30:20.040
No, no, no.

30:21.107 --> 30:23.208
You know, I think I saw two,
maybe three guys,

30:23.210 --> 30:24.177
they were armed,

30:24.179 --> 30:26.445
and they didn't
help him escape, they took him.

30:26.447 --> 30:27.480
He was abducted.

30:29.583 --> 30:32.386
Alex, what do you think?

30:34.588 --> 30:38.055
Tarzi's father was executed
by ISIS a few months ago,

30:38.057 --> 30:39.959
so, I'd start there.

30:41.562 --> 30:44.063
<i>You're making
too much noise, Ezra.</i>

30:44.365 --> 30:46.933
We had eyes and ears on Farouk,

30:47.201 --> 30:49.168
and he had friends
who are our enemies.

30:49.936 --> 30:51.936
Yeah,
I heard you interrogated him,

30:51.938 --> 30:54.273
so, I know that your objective
is the same as ours.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.176
I know that Al-Din
had your father executed.

30:57.944 --> 30:59.945
I also know that you people
never give up.

31:00.646 --> 31:02.483
My guys in Tripoli never did...

31:03.116 --> 31:05.051
and I'm guessing
that you won't either.

31:05.486 --> 31:08.085
And I just have this feeling
that you'll find Al-Din

31:08.087 --> 31:09.422
before he gets back to Libya.

31:09.722 --> 31:11.590
What I don't want
is for the Danish police

31:11.592 --> 31:12.590
to arrest him first

31:12.592 --> 31:15.060
because not only
will they refuse to extradite,

31:15.361 --> 31:16.961
they'll probably give him asylum

31:16.963 --> 31:18.364
and a fucking pension, no doubt.

31:18.631 --> 31:20.333
Why don't you do
your own dirty work?

31:20.666 --> 31:22.466
Because we are bound
by conventions

31:22.468 --> 31:23.669
and oversight committees.

31:24.837 --> 31:29.373
I have <i>VICE, New York Times,</i>
<i>Washington Post</i>

31:29.375 --> 31:31.976
all breathing down our necks,
nosing around our business,

31:31.978 --> 31:33.444
I can't just go around
slitting throats

31:33.446 --> 31:35.012
and chopping off fingers.

31:35.014 --> 31:37.281
The Danes don't take
too kindly to that.

31:37.283 --> 31:39.217
Can you pass the salt, please?

31:39.585 --> 31:41.187
Well, maybe in Tripoli,

31:41.387 --> 31:43.523
but not here
in fairy-tale Denmark.

31:44.257 --> 31:47.626
More importantly,
you're very, very good.

31:48.528 --> 31:50.929
And with you,
I don't just get a blood hound.

31:51.263 --> 31:55.401
I get a pit bull too,
the most worthy of cross breeds.

31:56.169 --> 31:57.936
This is personal to you.

31:59.138 --> 32:02.071
I lost five men
and my job to that man.

32:02.073 --> 32:04.608
Salar Al-Din should never have
been released from Guantanamo.

32:04.610 --> 32:07.045
Admittedly, I should never
have lost sight of him in Libya.

32:10.382 --> 32:12.415
You know,
he spent 11 years inside.

32:12.417 --> 32:14.017
He was the model prisoner,

32:14.019 --> 32:15.720
he did everything
that anybody asked of him.

32:17.155 --> 32:20.357
Imagine the patience that takes.
Eleven years.

32:20.359 --> 32:22.294
In the end,
they just had to let him go.

32:23.628 --> 32:25.663
Took him less than two days
to disappear

32:25.665 --> 32:28.298
once he got back to Libya.
That is why, my friend,

32:28.300 --> 32:30.633
you are going back
to that parallel universe,

32:30.635 --> 32:33.636
- so you can find him for me.
- How do you know I can?

32:33.638 --> 32:35.772
Same reason you know you can,

32:35.774 --> 32:38.308
you got a hell of a lot closer
to him than we did

32:38.310 --> 32:40.479
and we're the fucking CIA,
you're a one-man band.

32:42.714 --> 32:44.082
If I find him...

32:45.684 --> 32:47.319
you let my family go?

32:49.053 --> 32:50.687
Do you let my family go?

32:50.689 --> 32:52.155
- When you find him...
- Yes.

32:52.157 --> 32:53.555
- ...and you deliver him to me...
- Yes.

32:53.557 --> 32:55.427
...then, yes, I'll let you
and your family go.

33:00.197 --> 33:01.633
Where do you think
you'll start?

33:02.834 --> 33:06.036
If you heard my conversation
with Farouk,

33:06.771 --> 33:10.408
you know I was on my way
to his nephew.

33:12.243 --> 33:14.143
He put them in orange jumpsuits,

33:14.145 --> 33:15.444
bullet in the back of the head,

33:15.446 --> 33:16.548
decapitation of both.

33:18.215 --> 33:20.516
Unless they put him
in a cage and set fire to him.

33:20.518 --> 33:23.488
I mean, come on. I mean, look...
look at this video, look.

33:24.488 --> 33:26.322
I mean,
even the way they shoot it,

33:26.324 --> 33:28.025
it's like
they are professionals,

33:28.292 --> 33:31.496
I mean the use of graphics,
slow motion,

33:32.496 --> 33:33.798
even a drone shot.

33:38.636 --> 33:39.703
I need some air.

33:45.676 --> 33:47.576
I really don't understand
how you can eat

33:47.578 --> 33:49.480
after watching those executions.

33:50.114 --> 33:53.250
Just compartmentalize,
that's something Lars told me.

33:54.685 --> 33:56.520
How long
have you known each other?

33:56.720 --> 33:58.122
Hmm.

33:59.223 --> 34:00.558
Almost eight years.

34:02.826 --> 34:04.762
He helped me get sober.

34:05.863 --> 34:08.130
We shared a love
of two things:

34:08.132 --> 34:10.668
alcohol and police work,
very compatible.

34:11.702 --> 34:14.603
So, he introduced me to AA,

34:15.539 --> 34:17.408
then we became partners
and then...

34:18.576 --> 34:19.810
then we became friends.

34:22.379 --> 34:24.147
He always has my back.

34:24.882 --> 34:27.116
- Do you know him well?
- No.

34:33.724 --> 34:36.559
I'm... I'm not
a vengeful person, Christian,

34:36.827 --> 34:38.226
I'm really not.

34:38.228 --> 34:40.831
I'll find whoever did this,
I swear.

34:41.364 --> 34:42.532
Thank you.

34:48.839 --> 34:51.371
Hanne, let me take you home,
you need to get some sleep.

34:51.373 --> 34:52.842
No, I'm not leaving his side.

34:54.878 --> 34:57.447
Okay.

34:57.915 --> 34:59.947
If you need anything,
you call me.

34:59.949 --> 35:02.452
- Anything.
- Thank you.

35:03.586 --> 35:05.421
Thank you so much.

35:06.389 --> 35:07.557
Okay.

35:14.697 --> 35:16.466
I can't hear them.
Turn it up.

35:17.367 --> 35:19.266
<i>...I'll come back
and get you.</i>

35:19.268 --> 35:22.171
<i>Calm down. It's gonna be fine.</i>

35:23.640 --> 35:26.240
<i>Don't worry. I'll be back.</i>

35:26.242 --> 35:27.377
<i>We'll be home soon.</i>

38:42.002 --> 38:43.537
Farouk sent me.

38:49.677 --> 38:50.944
Do you know Al-Din?

38:52.813 --> 38:53.947
Al-Din?

38:56.683 --> 38:57.782
Al-Din

39:02.089 --> 39:03.089
Al-Din.

39:07.094 --> 39:08.128
Al-Din.

40:34.781 --> 40:37.081
So, our friend Al-Din
is in Brussels, huh?

42:46.177 --> 42:48.643
<i>Tonight's attack in Amsterdam</i>

42:48.645 --> 42:51.781
<i>has left 15 dead
and at least 20 wounded.</i>

42:52.149 --> 42:54.917
<i>ISIS has taken responsibility
for the attack</i>

42:54.919 --> 42:57.219
<i>and has gone on record
stating that the bomb...</i>

42:58.656 --> 42:59.687
Yeah.

42:59.689 --> 43:01.256
<i>I figured
you'd be interested</i>

43:01.258 --> 43:03.791
to learn that Hares' nephew
just fell off

43:03.793 --> 43:05.361
a seven-story balcony
here in Copenhagen.

43:06.129 --> 43:08.064
- Where?
- <i>Ishøj.</i>

43:09.799 --> 43:11.732
Okay, text me the address,

43:11.734 --> 43:13.335
get me whatever you can
find on the guy,

43:13.337 --> 43:14.804
and then call me back, okay?

43:21.778 --> 43:23.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:37.361 --> 43:38.361
Christian.

43:45.935 --> 43:47.135
What's going on?

43:47.137 --> 43:48.938
Why would Wold
show up for a jumper?

43:49.473 --> 43:51.875
I don't think
this is your typical jumper.

43:59.282 --> 44:00.682
It's a long way down.

44:02.751 --> 44:04.721
That's Farouk Hares' nephew.

44:05.255 --> 44:07.822
My guess is they were both
killed by the same guy;

44:07.824 --> 44:09.991
- Ezra Tarzi.
- There is going to be

44:09.993 --> 44:12.493
an investigation, Christian,
in what happened to Lars.

44:12.495 --> 44:14.261
Both because of the gun
but also because

44:14.263 --> 44:15.795
you didn't help
a colleague in need.

44:15.797 --> 44:16.733
Oh, wait a minute.

44:16.735 --> 44:18.432
I'm going to have to take you

44:18.434 --> 44:19.966
- off the case
- What?

44:19.968 --> 44:23.203
Omar, hold on.
Wold, you can't do that.

44:23.205 --> 44:25.139
Be at my office
tomorrow morning at 9:00

44:25.141 --> 44:26.875
- and bring your gun.
- Wold.

44:32.414 --> 44:35.315
- Yeah.
- Yusuf Hares rented a car

44:35.317 --> 44:38.084
the day before yesterday
and then he reported it stolen.

44:38.086 --> 44:41.321
It was just found in Brussels
a few hours ago, burned.

44:41.323 --> 44:43.892
- Brussels?
- <i>Yeah, Brussels.</i>

44:44.259 --> 44:45.761
You heard about
the shooting, right?

44:46.296 --> 44:47.296
I'm coming in.

44:55.037 --> 44:58.339
Peter, I need those prints
tonight. All of them.

44:58.341 --> 44:59.406
Okay.

45:40.482 --> 45:42.983
Ezra wants Al-Din
for the murder of his father

45:42.985 --> 45:45.084
and you say Al-Din drove
a rental to Brussels.

45:45.086 --> 45:46.052
Yeah.

45:46.054 --> 45:48.055
Then Ezra is going to be
in Brussels as well.

45:49.091 --> 45:50.224
We have to go to Brussels.

45:51.192 --> 45:52.891
Should we clear this with Wold?

45:52.893 --> 45:53.961
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

45:54.363 --> 45:56.297
- I'll give him a call.
- Okay.

45:58.267 --> 45:59.066
Give me one hour.

46:00.502 --> 46:03.035
- Um, I'll pick you up at 10:00.
- Okay.

46:56.490 --> 46:57.623
I love you.

47:20.447 --> 47:21.915
Alex.

47:36.229 --> 47:38.930
- Did Christian get in yet?
- No, I haven't seen him.

47:38.932 --> 47:41.334
Okay, if you see him,
tell him to come to my office.

47:45.706 --> 47:48.005
- That's Salar Al-Din?
- Yeah,

47:48.007 --> 47:50.174
Christian thinks
that's the guy Ezra is after,

47:50.176 --> 47:52.078
the one who killed his father.

48:01.621 --> 48:03.423
Yeah. Hi, Joe, it's Wold.

48:04.057 --> 48:05.090
Yes, it is.

48:07.327 --> 48:08.328
Uh-huh.

48:10.330 --> 48:11.331
Mm-hm.

48:12.999 --> 48:14.634
Oh, I wouldn't have thought so.

48:41.460 --> 48:44.428
You, my friend,
are a Jordanian diplomat,

48:44.430 --> 48:45.663
Assad Kouard.

48:45.665 --> 48:47.666
There's a passport
and a driver's license.

48:49.235 --> 48:51.536
Now, one of those cell phones
you found in that apartment

48:51.538 --> 48:53.539
yielded a very interesting piece
of information.

48:54.406 --> 48:57.644
Two incoming calls
from a Café Moustafa in Almeria.

48:58.411 --> 49:00.112
Now, the calls weren't answered,

49:01.146 --> 49:03.449
- but could be a signal.
- From Almeria?

49:03.783 --> 49:05.682
There's a ferry right
to North Africa.

49:05.684 --> 49:07.418
Once he's there, forget it!

49:07.420 --> 49:09.419
I don't know about you,
but I'm going to Almeria.

49:09.421 --> 49:10.457
Here's your ticket.

49:10.459 --> 49:12.725
You're booked on the first
flight in the morning.

49:13.859 --> 49:15.627
I'll meet you at the café
sometime in the afternoon.

49:17.195 --> 49:19.062
- Can I see my family?
- When you're done.

49:19.064 --> 49:21.600
- That's when I'll see mine.
- Do you have any children?

49:22.167 --> 49:23.567
Close the door
on the way out.

49:23.569 --> 49:24.703
Do you have any children?

49:37.716 --> 49:41.487
- Hey, Hanne, everything okay?
- <i>No.</i>

49:43.155 --> 49:45.156
<i>He's gone, Christian.</i>

49:45.457 --> 49:48.527
- <i>20 minutes ago.</i>
- Oh, my God.

49:50.261 --> 49:54.296
I'm so sorry, Hanne.
Is there anything I can do?

49:54.298 --> 49:55.664
<i>No, no,
I'm gonna be okay.</i>

49:55.666 --> 49:57.068
I'm gonna be sick.

49:57.736 --> 49:59.568
Hanne, we'll get through this,
I promise you.

49:59.570 --> 50:02.106
I'll, uh... I'll call you
tomorrow. Okay?

50:04.376 --> 50:05.608
What the hell is going on?

50:28.833 --> 50:31.335
Hey. Hey.

50:34.205 --> 50:37.108
It's okay, it's okay.

50:42.881 --> 50:46.284
We loved... we loved
each other so... so much.

50:48.152 --> 50:49.086
What?

50:49.420 --> 50:51.222
I was so in love with him.

50:53.824 --> 50:55.393
What are you talking about?

50:57.728 --> 50:59.095
With Lars.

51:01.332 --> 51:02.332
No.

51:03.901 --> 51:05.868
- No.
- He really loved me.

51:05.870 --> 51:07.071
No.

51:08.405 --> 51:10.672
It was not just an affair.
It's not what you think.

51:10.674 --> 51:12.675
We were really in love
with each other.

51:12.677 --> 51:16.412
We wanted a family together.
And he was going to leave Hanne.

51:16.414 --> 51:17.280
- No.
- Yes.

51:17.282 --> 51:19.248
- He was gonna leave... I know.
- Hanne is sick.

51:19.250 --> 51:20.381
- But he was gonna leave her.
- She is sick.

51:20.383 --> 51:23.151
- He was gonna leave her.
- No. Shut it. Shut up, shut up.

51:23.153 --> 51:24.553
- He was gonna leave...
- He is dead!

51:38.836 --> 51:39.868
Fuck.

51:57.420 --> 52:00.390
This is pointless.
Let's get help from Copenhagen.

52:18.908 --> 52:21.745
And as of this morning,
I'm no longer on the case.

52:22.812 --> 52:24.648
I'm under investigation.

52:25.481 --> 52:27.550
- I can get help.
- Yeah, if we need it.

52:28.550 --> 52:30.353
- We need it, Christian.
- Yeah.

52:32.421 --> 52:35.222
I would have known
if Lars was having an affair,

52:35.224 --> 52:37.327
if he was leaving Hanne,
he would have told me.

52:38.494 --> 52:39.496
He would have.

52:41.765 --> 52:42.932
- Here we go.
- Okay.

52:44.801 --> 52:46.202
- Hey.
- Hashish?

53:43.424 --> 53:44.493
Enough therapy?

54:05.313 --> 54:07.849
- It's Omar.
- Put it on speaker.

54:09.017 --> 54:10.816
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, it's Omar.</i>

54:10.818 --> 54:14.320
I had this facial recognition
program running

54:14.322 --> 54:15.389
hoping to pick up Ezra.

54:15.391 --> 54:18.292
It's tapping into the CCTV
system in Copenhagen.

54:19.927 --> 54:21.562
And guess what?
I just found him.

54:21.764 --> 54:23.829
<i>Getting on a flight
to Almeria</i>

54:23.831 --> 54:24.833
<i>from Kastrup Airport</i>

54:26.033 --> 54:28.501
<i>and the flight is SAS
and it departs at 07:40.</i>

54:28.503 --> 54:30.704
And by the way,
he cut off his hair and beard.

54:30.706 --> 54:31.873
Thanks, Omar.

54:33.341 --> 54:34.475
Find the airport.

54:38.412 --> 54:39.447
Passport.

54:40.447 --> 54:44.917
Hey, I need two tickets
to the south of Spain,

54:44.919 --> 54:45.921
as soon as possible.

54:46.888 --> 54:49.354
Yeah. I've got a direct flight
to Almeria,

54:49.356 --> 54:51.624
- tomorrow morning at 6:00.
- Uh, no, um,

54:51.626 --> 54:52.827
what about Malaga?

54:54.428 --> 54:56.562
Yes, I've got a departure
to Malaga

54:56.564 --> 54:57.897
- at 2:00 this afternoon.
- Perfect.

54:57.899 --> 54:59.098
- Hi, it's Alex.
- Alex,

54:59.100 --> 55:00.699
hey, you have to call Wold.

55:00.701 --> 55:03.371
Why would an ISIS terrorist
escape to Almeria?

55:03.805 --> 55:05.640
<i>Probably to catch
the ferry to Melilla.</i>

55:06.908 --> 55:09.141
- Where is Melilla?
- <i>It's in Morocco.</i>

55:09.143 --> 55:11.344
You know, once he's in
North Africa, he'd be safe.

55:12.480 --> 55:13.981
Right, okay, got it.

55:18.388 --> 55:20.886
We are police, both of us,
and we have guns.

55:20.888 --> 55:22.720
I need your license
and your export documents

55:22.722 --> 55:24.056
- to the EFP, please.
- Sure, I understand.

55:24.058 --> 55:25.725
Do you have any forms
we can fill out?

55:25.926 --> 55:27.593
You need to apply
three days ahead and...

55:27.595 --> 55:29.496
I don't have three days,
what do we do?

55:29.797 --> 55:31.796
You wanna catch your plane,
I'll need you gun, sir.

55:31.798 --> 55:33.901
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Forget it, it's Brussels.

55:35.903 --> 55:37.470
- Thank you, ma'am.
- There you go.

55:38.940 --> 55:41.575
- Have a safe flight.
- Thanks.

56:08.935 --> 56:11.805
Whatever happened,
it's not gonna bring Lars back.

56:13.940 --> 56:15.977
Hanna is a widow
in a wheelchair, but you...

56:16.710 --> 56:18.710
you'll move on,
you'll find someone else,

56:18.712 --> 56:19.744
you'll forget about him.

56:19.746 --> 56:21.915
You're such a fucking asshole.

56:22.782 --> 56:24.417
- What?
- Here!

57:18.504 --> 57:19.538
Oh.

57:33.954 --> 57:35.552
Just because someone called
from there

57:35.554 --> 57:37.423
doesn't mean that
Al-Din will show up.

57:38.157 --> 57:40.159
Well, that's for you
to find out, isn't it?

57:44.863 --> 57:46.664
I better go check the ferry.

58:18.230 --> 58:20.029
Don't you just love these

58:20.031 --> 58:22.233
Mickey Mouse airport rentals.

58:29.107 --> 58:31.709
Do you want me to drive?
You haven't slept for days.

58:32.844 --> 58:35.913
- Neither have you.
- No, but I'm not pregnant.

58:37.915 --> 58:38.916
I'm fine.

58:49.227 --> 58:52.063
Couple of years ago I asked Lars
if he'd met someone else.

58:53.031 --> 58:54.931
We were together
for three years.

58:54.933 --> 58:56.734
Suddenly, he was so happy.

58:57.869 --> 58:59.570
Started working out,

59:00.104 --> 59:02.573
got a gym membership,
he even went twice.

59:05.009 --> 59:06.911
He said he'd never cheat
on Hanne.

59:08.346 --> 59:12.016
- Well, he lied to you.
- Yeah. Yes, he did.

59:19.122 --> 59:20.992
There's that sign again.

59:26.831 --> 59:27.832
Of course.

59:30.168 --> 59:33.769
I bet Al-Din
is smuggling guns and explosives

59:33.771 --> 59:35.038
to Almeria by boat.

59:36.040 --> 59:38.140
<i>Then he hides them
in tomato crates,</i>

59:38.142 --> 59:40.010
<i>loaded onto trucks
like that one.</i>

59:40.378 --> 59:43.144
<i>And that means he's got boats</i>

59:43.146 --> 59:45.980
<i>going back and forth
from Morocco, Libya,</i>

59:45.982 --> 59:47.150
<i>God knows where.</i>

59:48.319 --> 59:50.321
<i>He's getting on a boat
to go home.</i>

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:05.235
Mm-hm.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:42.706
Hey, hey.

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:06.229
Mustafa.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.902
- Al-Din?
- Salah Al-Din.

01:03:44.885 --> 01:03:48.022
- Hey, is that Al-Din?
- You gotta be kidding me.

01:03:50.258 --> 01:03:52.159
Yeah. All right,
let's follow him.

01:04:57.491 --> 01:04:58.590
Here we go.

01:05:16.108 --> 01:05:17.276
What's going on?

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.518
It's a distraction.

01:05:34.393 --> 01:05:36.627
- What's that guy doing?
- Follow him.

01:05:36.629 --> 01:05:38.230
I'll keep an eye on Al-Din.

01:10:58.747 --> 01:11:00.982
Ole!

01:11:01.783 --> 01:11:03.685
Ole!

01:11:05.788 --> 01:11:07.655
Ole!

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.357
Ole!

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.974
Ole!

01:12:36.409 --> 01:12:37.945
Ole!

01:15:10.161 --> 01:15:11.230
Ole!

01:17:05.908 --> 01:17:07.209
Christian?

01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:08.745
- Can you hear me?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:17:09.446 --> 01:17:11.014
Did you get Al-Din?

01:17:11.382 --> 01:17:12.382
Yeah.

01:17:12.850 --> 01:17:14.182
Yeah, but he's wounded.

01:17:14.184 --> 01:17:15.183
What about you?

01:17:15.185 --> 01:17:17.754
<i>I'm fine.
What do we do now?</i>

01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:21.391
I don't know.

01:17:22.292 --> 01:17:23.227
Spanish police?

01:17:23.794 --> 01:17:25.026
And forget about Ezra Tarzi?

01:17:25.028 --> 01:17:26.029
No!

01:17:26.963 --> 01:17:27.998
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:17:28.799 --> 01:17:30.700
Look up.
You see that big Dura sign?

01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:37.039
- Yeah, I can see it.
- That's where I am.

01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:39.108
<i>Okay, I'm coming.</i>

01:17:54.891 --> 01:17:57.126
- Yeah, it's Wold.
- <i>Wold, it's Alex.</i>

01:17:58.295 --> 01:17:59.363
<i>What time is it?</i>

01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:02.863
- What do you want?
- I'm in Almeria

01:18:02.865 --> 01:18:06.068
with a wounded Al-Din.
The ISIS leader.

01:18:07.203 --> 01:18:09.270
I know who Al-Din is.

01:18:09.272 --> 01:18:11.375
What the hell are you doing
in Almeria?

01:18:12.108 --> 01:18:13.741
<i>I'm here
with Christian Toft,</i>

01:18:13.743 --> 01:18:15.442
<i>We tracked Ezra Tarzi
down here.</i>

01:18:15.444 --> 01:18:18.145
They're on a rooftop
with a big neon sign.

01:18:18.147 --> 01:18:20.082
It says Dura on it.

01:18:21.284 --> 01:18:23.219
Okay. Don't do anything.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.323
Don't contact the police,
I'll be in touch.

01:18:29.326 --> 01:18:31.861
Fucking hell.

01:18:38.301 --> 01:18:40.269
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Hi, Joe.

01:18:40.503 --> 01:18:42.771
- It's Wold
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

01:18:43.472 --> 01:18:45.975
My people have Al-Din.

01:18:48.009 --> 01:18:50.012
Will you just excuse me
for one moment.

01:18:52.048 --> 01:18:53.216
Are you kidding me?

01:18:53.218 --> 01:18:56.050
Because I happen to have
your Ezra Tarzi right here,

01:18:56.052 --> 01:18:59.021
so how do you feel
about a little horse trade?

01:19:01.891 --> 01:19:03.058
So, where are your people?

01:19:03.992 --> 01:19:05.061
Dura?

01:19:05.927 --> 01:19:06.928
Uh-hm.

01:19:07.363 --> 01:19:08.364
Okay.

01:19:16.204 --> 01:19:18.807
I'm afraid you're going to have
to give me that knife now.

01:19:21.209 --> 01:19:23.346
- Hand it over.
- Why?

01:19:25.514 --> 01:19:26.580
Just give it to me.

01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:29.252
Christian?

01:19:30.552 --> 01:19:32.288
He says not to call
the local police.

01:19:32.853 --> 01:19:34.354
He's going to call me
back, though.

01:19:34.356 --> 01:19:35.921
I'm trying to get to you,

01:19:35.923 --> 01:19:37.857
but it's just teeming
with people here.

01:19:45.967 --> 01:19:48.970
- Detective Christian Toft?
- Joe Martin?

01:19:49.404 --> 01:19:50.205
Correct.

01:19:51.106 --> 01:19:52.538
Wold told me about
your little deal.

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:54.307
- Good
- You got Tarzi?

01:19:54.309 --> 01:19:56.111
- I certainly do.
- Bring him in.

01:19:59.548 --> 01:20:00.982
Whoa, whoa.

01:20:02.850 --> 01:20:04.217
Call an ambulance!

01:20:04.219 --> 01:20:05.451
Tarzi, move away.

01:20:07.555 --> 01:20:10.023
- Call an ambulance.
- Move away.

01:20:10.025 --> 01:20:11.923
He lives and I get
my family back.

01:20:14.129 --> 01:20:16.164
Move the fuck away.

01:20:16.498 --> 01:20:17.865
Shoot me.

01:20:26.374 --> 01:20:28.909
Hey, easy now.

01:20:31.379 --> 01:20:32.512
Hey, hold on, hold on.

01:20:32.514 --> 01:20:34.247
This deal's off,
Al-Din's dead,

01:20:34.249 --> 01:20:35.448
Ezra's coming with me.

01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:37.949
Oh, no, he's not.

01:20:37.951 --> 01:20:40.386
I'm the CIA, and this man
has a lot more work

01:20:40.388 --> 01:20:41.421
he can do for us.

01:20:41.423 --> 01:20:43.423
I don't give a fuck
who you are.

01:20:43.425 --> 01:20:45.991
He killed my partner,
he is coming back to Denmark.

01:20:45.993 --> 01:20:48.527
Detective, it's rare to find
this kind of talent,

01:20:48.529 --> 01:20:51.063
it's personal to him,
he's avenging his father

01:20:51.065 --> 01:20:52.364
and I have him on a leash.

01:20:52.366 --> 01:20:54.435
You can't buy that kind
of commitment.

01:20:54.935 --> 01:20:57.336
Nothing works like vengeance,
and this man

01:20:57.338 --> 01:20:59.004
has plenty of vengeance left
in him.

01:21:06.313 --> 01:21:08.048
Oh, Christ.

01:21:11.318 --> 01:21:13.085
You feel good
avenging your lover?

01:21:15.689 --> 01:21:17.289
How did you know?

01:21:17.291 --> 01:21:19.326
We're Americans,
we read your emails.

01:21:37.444 --> 01:21:39.513
Hey. Let me take this.

01:21:44.351 --> 01:21:45.552
I do feel better.

01:21:52.292 --> 01:21:53.358
Hey.

01:22:48.015 --> 01:22:53.015
