00:10.568 --> 00:12.861
Reade?

00:12.943 --> 00:14.262
Reade?

00:14.297 --> 00:15.516
What the hell happened?

00:15.551 --> 00:16.816
I didn't do it. I was in the basement,

00:16.885 --> 00:18.503
I heard a noise, I came up here,

00:18.584 --> 00:20.418
and I found him like this.

00:22.662 --> 00:24.877
- We gotta call this in.
- No-no-no, don't.

00:24.912 --> 00:26.431
You and Jones have a history.

00:26.503 --> 00:29.056
You were harassing him,
you broke into his house.

00:29.091 --> 00:30.276
- I didn't kill him.
- You are standing

00:30.311 --> 00:31.312
over his dead body

00:31.347 --> 00:33.783
with gloves on your hands
and blood on your shoes.

00:33.852 --> 00:35.727
Innocent people have gone
to jail for a lot less.

00:35.762 --> 00:37.583
(car engine rumbling)

00:37.618 --> 00:39.371
(tires screeching)

00:39.465 --> 00:40.719
It's the neighborhood security.

00:40.789 --> 00:42.401
We gotta get out of here.

00:42.436 --> 00:43.486
Did you touch anything?

00:43.521 --> 00:45.926
- I-I don't think so.
- Did you move anything?

00:45.961 --> 00:47.526
No.

00:47.623 --> 00:48.876
Wait, Zapata!

00:48.957 --> 00:50.925
This is crazy. We're the FBI.

00:50.995 --> 00:53.072
That's gotta count for something.

00:53.157 --> 00:55.444
I'm your friend. I believe you.

- (engine starting)
- The tape!

01:08.934 --> 01:10.378
I left it in the VCR.

01:10.454 --> 01:12.865
No! The security guards are in the house.

01:12.900 --> 01:13.949
What tape?

01:13.984 --> 01:16.429
What were you doing at Jones's?

01:16.464 --> 01:19.319
I was looking for... I
needed proof of the abuse.

01:19.398 --> 01:21.488
I found all these tapes
with kids' names on 'em.

01:22.668 --> 01:23.883
And they just looked
like old practice tape,

01:23.918 --> 01:25.061
but they were hidden.

01:26.209 --> 01:27.991
One of 'em had my name on it.

01:28.026 --> 01:29.764
Did you watch it?

01:29.799 --> 01:32.577
No, I-I wanted to, but I couldn't, I...

01:33.082 --> 01:34.265
I heard a loud noise upstairs,

01:34.300 --> 01:35.781
the killer must've run off
when he heard me coming.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.205
And now there's a tape with
your name on it in the VCR.

01:38.275 --> 01:39.681
NYPD finds it, they'll
start looking at you,

01:39.761 --> 01:40.884
they'll find out you were in the house.

01:40.919 --> 01:41.781
The tape wouldn't have mattered

01:41.816 --> 01:43.522
if you were never there,
but you were there.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.286
Super-cool encryption.

01:49.321 --> 01:52.563
Picture the digital
equivalent of laminar flow.

01:52.598 --> 01:54.517
Patterson, Douglas Winter's responsible

01:54.552 --> 01:56.918
for the biggest intel leak in U.S. history.

01:56.953 --> 01:58.582
He's evaded capture for three years.

01:58.617 --> 02:00.060
Can we get to the part where we catch him?

02:00.095 --> 02:03.134
The black hole image isn't just one entity.

02:03.169 --> 02:06.560
It unravels into massive amounts of text.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.348
In this case, thousands of e-mails
from Douglas Winter's account.

02:10.383 --> 02:12.007
(Nas) Could it be
another intelligence leak?

02:12.042 --> 02:13.885
I thought so too, at first,

02:13.973 --> 02:17.100
but these e-mails were
junk, literally spam.

02:17.135 --> 02:18.838
And it didn't make any sense until I found

02:18.913 --> 02:20.952
the needle in the needlestack...

02:21.021 --> 02:24.243
A coded message addressed to Krysta Massey,

02:24.329 --> 02:26.101
Winter's girlfriend.

02:26.136 --> 02:27.579
Or, ex-girlfriend now. I don't know

02:27.614 --> 02:29.325
if they're doing the
whole long-distance thing.

02:29.419 --> 02:30.739
It's Bulgarian.

02:30.774 --> 02:32.007
"My fair darling.

02:32.079 --> 02:34.039
"Winter's come to the grand hotel.

02:34.074 --> 02:35.048
Love, Maria."

02:35.083 --> 02:37.859
(Patterson) Yes, that's
right. I think Winter

02:37.894 --> 02:42.829
wanted his girlfriend to come to Bulgaria
and meet him at the Grand Hotel Maria.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.831
Our agents questioned Massey.

02:44.866 --> 02:46.519
She claims she never received the file,

02:46.554 --> 02:49.135
and she hasn't left the
States since Winter went AWOL.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.908
So, his message must have been intercepted.

02:50.943 --> 02:51.771
(Weller) By Mayfair.

02:51.806 --> 02:53.424
She left us the Daylight file,

02:53.459 --> 02:55.623
the Orion file, and this.

02:55.658 --> 02:56.713
She's trying to find Winter.

02:56.748 --> 02:58.581
Well, either way, we
need to get to that hotel.

02:58.683 --> 03:00.109
I'm gonna get the plane ready for us.

03:00.196 --> 03:02.629
Get an FBI attaché on
that hotel before we arrive.

03:02.664 --> 03:04.319
- (phone vibrates)
- Someone discreet,

03:04.410 --> 03:05.770
and this stays off the books.

03:05.840 --> 03:06.367
(Patterson) On it.

03:06.402 --> 03:07.375
(sighs) It's Roman.

03:07.461 --> 03:09.131
He's calling me in.

03:09.575 --> 03:10.663
You'll have to go.

03:10.748 --> 03:13.132
I should go with you,
it's... it's Mayfair's file.

03:13.167 --> 03:14.696
Jane, look...

03:14.731 --> 03:16.598
we need to know Sandstorm's endgame, okay?

03:16.698 --> 03:18.684
And we are running out of time.

03:18.770 --> 03:21.674
We'll handle Winter, you
keep working on Roman.

03:21.709 --> 03:24.437
I've hit a wall. He doesn't fully trust me.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.617
He wants you to be Remi.

03:26.690 --> 03:29.785
He followed you once, so
make him follow you again.

03:29.878 --> 03:31.479
Before it's too late.

03:33.601 --> 03:35.402
(Zapata) We've gotta
get rid of these clothes.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.502
Who knows what we came into contact with?

03:45.171 --> 03:47.007
Why is there a knife missing?

03:47.090 --> 03:49.029
It broke, I threw it away.

03:49.064 --> 03:50.210
You never replaced it?

03:50.245 --> 03:51.211
I eat takeout, Zapata,

03:51.246 --> 03:53.026
what do I need 13 knives for?

03:56.823 --> 03:58.473
I know how we can get that tape back.

03:58.508 --> 03:59.984
We go in as FBI.

04:00.019 --> 04:02.137
And what, we just show up
following up a tattoo case?

04:02.172 --> 04:03.164
You have a better idea?

04:03.199 --> 04:04.369
- Yeah, the truth.
- No!

04:04.404 --> 04:05.690
We can do this.

04:05.725 --> 04:07.396
NYPD's gonna start upstairs with the body,

04:07.431 --> 04:10.101
They got no reason to look in the VCR.

04:10.953 --> 04:13.840
We can put the tape back in the closet
before anybody notices it's missing.

04:13.932 --> 04:16.880
We just have to wait until they
make it an official crime scene.

04:19.269 --> 04:20.672
What do we do until then?

04:20.707 --> 04:22.017
Burn our clothes, get some sleep,

04:22.089 --> 04:23.962
go to work like everything's normal.

04:27.128 --> 04:28.692
Roman'll be right in.

04:54.635 --> 04:57.203
It was the last thing our parents gave us.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.143
The only thing we have left.

05:00.969 --> 05:03.194
We used to give it to each
other at the orphanage.

05:03.229 --> 05:06.682
Birthdays and special occasions.

05:06.798 --> 05:09.485
Whenever one of us was
feeling scared or sad.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.053
The guards let us keep it?

05:11.142 --> 05:12.943
They didn't know we had it.

05:16.123 --> 05:18.092
Old habits die hard.

05:26.241 --> 05:27.875
It's a puzzle box.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.590
You gave it to me just
before your memory went.

05:34.557 --> 05:36.958
Wh-What's in it?

05:37.171 --> 05:40.310
I don't know. I couldn't open it.

05:41.099 --> 05:42.900
I was hoping you could.

05:59.333 --> 06:00.361
Get some sleep.

06:00.396 --> 06:02.066
Tomorrow we're heading to Bradley Dynamics.

06:02.101 --> 06:04.135
- Another mission?
- <i>The</i> mission.

06:04.204 --> 06:06.462
The one Jeffrey Kantor was supposed to do.

06:06.497 --> 06:09.591
I covered for you once.
I won't do it again.

06:11.040 --> 06:14.055
I need my sister back.

06:15.001 --> 06:17.109
The microchip is really that important?

06:17.144 --> 06:19.966
Once we have it, the rest is all timing.

06:20.052 --> 06:22.661
This chip is the final
piece to Shepherd's plan.

06:22.747 --> 06:24.882
It's the beginning of the end.

jump on a plane to Bulgaria?

I put two and two together.

07:54.823 --> 07:56.863
So, here's just a little friendly heads up.

07:56.937 --> 07:59.646
I'm not leaving without Douglas Winter.

07:59.724 --> 08:01.188
Neither are we.

Cool is my default setting.

we make fun weekend plans,

08:20.665 --> 08:22.348
something blows up and
I have to be on call.

08:22.383 --> 08:25.485
I don't care what we do
as long as we're together.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.470
But I was thinking, if you're
finished swinging at me,

08:27.575 --> 08:30.647
maybe we could just work on some holds.

08:32.563 --> 08:33.764
Yeah...

Cool is definitely not

Okay.

08:56.235 --> 08:57.940
- Hey, thanks for coming in.
- What's up?

08:58.006 --> 09:00.324
I got an alert. Coach Jones is dead.

09:00.359 --> 09:02.834
NYPD just logged it as
a murder investigation.

09:02.889 --> 09:04.805
- What?
- We exposed decades of abuse.

09:04.860 --> 09:06.598
This guy's gotta have a lot of enemies.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.587
- I figured...
- We should check it out.

09:08.622 --> 09:11.404
At least have NYPD keep us in
the loop on the investigation.

09:11.439 --> 09:12.905
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

09:13.657 --> 09:15.822
We're stealing a
state-of-the-art prototype

09:15.915 --> 09:18.664
locked in a secure vault
at Bradley Dynamics.

09:18.699 --> 09:20.533
How do we get in without Kantor?

09:22.881 --> 09:25.174
Occupational Safety and
Health Administration.

09:25.236 --> 09:28.078
I backstopped our IDs and
set a meeting with Tom Nelson.

09:28.113 --> 09:30.255
Tom has access to the secure zone.

09:30.346 --> 09:32.078
And a severe peanut allergy.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.314
So, we steal Tom's access badge and
send him into anaphylactic shock.

09:35.356 --> 09:37.771
We slip into the secure
zone and head to the R&D lab

09:37.836 --> 09:38.823
where the chip's being held,

09:38.858 --> 09:41.536
but what Tom doesn't have
access to is the vault.

09:41.588 --> 09:42.691
That's where this comes in.

09:42.762 --> 09:44.269
I'm guessing that's not a smartphone.

09:44.304 --> 09:46.839
It's a code breaker. Digital brute force.

09:46.874 --> 09:48.534
But, it takes time.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.873
We'll have to wait a full five
minutes for it to open the vault.

09:50.908 --> 09:52.811
When it does, it'll trigger the alarm.

09:52.869 --> 09:54.824
We'll only have 90 seconds to get the chip,

09:54.859 --> 09:56.932
get to the north wing, and get out.

09:56.984 --> 09:59.010
- Cameras?
- Static CCTV.

09:59.045 --> 10:01.076
So, they monitor, but they don't record.

10:01.111 --> 10:04.146
The only footage we'll need
to loop is in the R&D lab.

10:04.239 --> 10:06.146
- Not an iPod.
- Not an iPod.

10:07.781 --> 10:09.761
So, what's my cover story for the FBI?

10:09.796 --> 10:11.917
My go-to favorite, food poisoning.

10:11.994 --> 10:14.629
Mmm, I knew that sushi tasted funny.

10:16.535 --> 10:17.703
What?

10:17.757 --> 10:19.916
You've got that look.

10:19.978 --> 10:21.907
We should blow up the
vault to cover our tracks.

10:21.971 --> 10:25.391
Make it look more like a rival
company sabotage than a heist.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.362
Good idea.

10:26.397 --> 10:28.071
I'll pack some detonation cord.

10:28.106 --> 10:31.194
There are metal detectors
in the lobby, so, no guns.

10:31.229 --> 10:34.376
If anything goes wrong,
we'll have to improvise.

10:39.307 --> 10:40.507
Good to know.

10:42.172 --> 10:43.749
(Weller) Here's our guy on the ground.

10:43.849 --> 10:45.552
Sorry we're late. Is everything all right?

10:45.634 --> 10:47.981

Six, by my count, but autopsy'll confirm.

go? You're clearly busy.

20:56.930 --> 20:58.191
No,
no-no-no-no-no, no.

20:58.239 --> 21:00.312
I... I... I want to eat together.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.221
Look, see, how about this?

21:02.256 --> 21:05.818
I will just eat right here in my lab,

21:05.887 --> 21:08.208
and you can eat in the
hallway just outside the door.

21:08.243 --> 21:11.046
That's the worst. I'm saying it
out loud, and that's the worst.

21:11.111 --> 21:12.727
It's actually not the
worst date I've been on.

21:12.762 --> 21:15.996
Okay, this is a super-small tech thing.

21:16.031 --> 21:17.701
It's super-easy to do.

21:17.759 --> 21:20.060
And I will be done so soon.

21:20.172 --> 21:21.179
Okay.

21:21.257 --> 21:23.601
Okay. But you gotta...

21:23.689 --> 21:25.190
Yep. Right, yep.

21:29.767 --> 21:32.851
Okay, well, that wraps up
compliance and enforcement.

21:32.927 --> 21:34.718
Do you have any questions for us?

21:34.753 --> 21:36.647
None that I can think of, and I'm sorry

21:36.682 --> 21:39.305
to cut this short, but
I have another meeting.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.901
I will walk you out.

21:40.971 --> 21:42.920
Oh, we can show ourselves out.

21:42.955 --> 21:45.402
Ah, I have to escort you... protocol.

21:45.466 --> 21:47.066
Of course.

21:47.116 --> 21:50.829
Uh, wait... we, uh, we
forgot sexual harassment.

21:50.884 --> 21:52.051
Will you give us a minute?

21:52.130 --> 21:55.766
I'm sure that Cyndie would be more
comfortable talking with just me.

21:56.802 --> 21:58.836
- I'll be right outside.
- Great.

22:01.139 --> 22:03.628
Since when does OSHA cover sexual harass...

22:03.663 --> 22:06.343
(groaning)

22:06.428 --> 22:08.474
I know it doesn't feel like it now,

22:08.541 --> 22:10.175
but I am saving your life.

22:10.249 --> 22:12.116
(grunts)

22:16.609 --> 22:18.094
- What was that about?
- Saving the mission.

22:18.144 --> 22:19.256
Notice how I'm not covered in blood?

22:19.291 --> 22:22.392
Give me the letter opener and smarten up.

22:22.427 --> 22:24.595
We don't have long until
someone comes looking for her.

22:24.630 --> 22:26.797
(beeping, door opens)

22:37.455 --> 22:39.416
She always had the answer.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.143
Who to talk to.

22:44.783 --> 22:46.483
What to do next.

22:46.707 --> 22:49.019
Context that I wasn't seeing.

22:49.277 --> 22:52.599
Mayfair was always there for me.

22:52.685 --> 22:54.838
She sounds like an amazing woman.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.514
She was.

22:58.452 --> 23:00.686
And now my life's...

23:00.900 --> 23:03.481
full of all of these unanswered questions.

23:04.970 --> 23:06.904
Why have they been watching me

23:07.157 --> 23:08.906
since I was a kid?

23:09.268 --> 23:12.622
Why did they choose me? And what for?

23:12.734 --> 23:15.649
This is gonna sound a
little crazy, but, um...

23:15.747 --> 23:17.669
I was hoping...

23:18.654 --> 23:20.887
for just one last time

23:21.494 --> 23:23.962
that Mayfair would have an answer for me.

23:29.258 --> 23:30.596
Listen...

23:31.630 --> 23:33.497
we'll find those answers, okay?

23:33.570 --> 23:35.092
I hope you're right.

23:35.154 --> 23:36.769
'Cause, right now,

23:36.811 --> 23:39.593
I feel like there's no one left to turn to.

23:39.873 --> 23:41.336
Yeah, there is.

24:04.755 --> 24:06.755
He's in an FBI safe house.

24:06.868 --> 24:08.368
We'll need more men.

24:13.148 --> 24:14.683
<i>Fly to a non-extradition
country tonight</i>

24:14.754 --> 24:17.867
<i>and never come back, or stay
and suffer the consequences</i>

24:17.902 --> 24:19.545
<i>of becoming the biggest
traitor to this country</i>

24:19.580 --> 24:20.869
<i>since Benedict Arnold.</i>

24:20.969 --> 24:22.908
- Seriously, should I just go?
- No! No.

24:22.994 --> 24:25.148
I like that you're here.
You're super-motivating.

24:25.203 --> 24:26.329
I feel like I'm stressing you out.

24:26.368 --> 24:29.684
No, work is stressing me
out, and you're doing great.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.449
Do you want to talk about it?

24:31.484 --> 24:33.971
I can't. It's classified,

24:34.006 --> 24:36.386
and... and I can't talk about it

24:36.421 --> 24:39.287
without going into specifics,
which I can't, because...

24:39.344 --> 24:40.738
It's classified.

24:40.773 --> 24:43.225
Basically, the thing that
I'm working on isn't doing

24:43.260 --> 24:44.743
the thing it's supposed to be doing

24:44.814 --> 24:46.398
when I'm doing the thing
that I'm doing to it.

24:46.468 --> 24:48.035
Does that make any sense?

24:48.082 --> 24:48.885
I'm gonna go.

24:48.940 --> 24:51.209
No, can you just get... 15 minutes.

24:51.248 --> 24:53.094
You said 15 minutes two hours ago.

24:53.152 --> 24:55.948
Okay, then give me, like, a solid
half an hour, just 30 minutes...

24:56.005 --> 24:57.245
Look, just give me a call tomorrow...

24:57.303 --> 24:59.738
I am under a lot of
pressure, David, and I...

25:03.057 --> 25:04.144
I just called you David.

25:04.178 --> 25:07.272
That's fine. It happens.

25:07.624 --> 25:10.315
- Robert...
- I'll give you some space.

25:10.428 --> 25:11.869
Robert...

25:12.472 --> 25:16.008
(door closing)

25:18.779 --> 25:20.813
(beep, air hisses)

25:25.118 --> 25:27.549
- (beeping)
- There, it's looped.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.760
Like we were never here.

25:34.472 --> 25:36.539
_

25:37.464 --> 25:38.187
(beeping)

25:38.225 --> 25:40.761
Okay, five minutes starting now.

25:40.823 --> 25:42.465
(Jane) Can I ask you something?

25:42.543 --> 25:44.756
Why "Shepherd"? Why not "Mom"?

25:44.791 --> 25:46.271
We tried calling her
that when we were younger,

25:46.306 --> 25:48.374
but she's never really
been the mom type, you know?

25:48.409 --> 25:50.302
Shepherd just felt closer to the truth.

25:50.337 --> 25:52.602
- Shepherd isn't her real name?
- (chuckling)

25:52.688 --> 25:54.224
That'd be a little convenient.

25:54.259 --> 25:55.784
So, what is it?

25:58.131 --> 26:00.173
Remember, whenever that alarm goes off,

26:00.252 --> 26:02.624
the most important thing is that chip.

26:03.581 --> 26:05.862
Well, you're making it sound like
we're not gonna get out of here.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.593
I don't plan to die, but I'm prepared to.

26:08.791 --> 26:11.732
Winning the war is bigger
than any one soldier.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.008
(man) I wasn't on shift the night of.

26:16.074 --> 26:19.903
But I saw a guy sitting in a car
outside the vic's house that morning.

26:19.938 --> 26:21.369
Black guy, short hair.

26:21.404 --> 26:24.167
- You get a plate?
- Yeah, I wrote it down.

26:24.238 --> 26:26.679
I just got that feeling, you know?

26:30.765 --> 26:34.163
This guy you saw? He's undercover FBI.

26:34.218 --> 26:37.019
We've been working on
something big for years.

26:37.068 --> 26:40.270
If you bring him into this
whole Coach Jones mess,

26:40.450 --> 26:43.912
you will... blow his cover.

26:44.017 --> 26:47.961
I'd be in breach of trust,
you know, obstructing justice?

26:48.043 --> 26:51.017
My girlfriend's pregnant, I can't
risk my job or going to jail.

26:51.114 --> 26:53.620
Your girlfriend, Maria Lopez, right?

26:54.742 --> 26:56.888
I mean, am I in some sort of trouble here?

26:56.935 --> 26:57.834
No, of course not.

26:57.869 --> 26:59.526
But, I couldn't help
but noticing that Maria

26:59.561 --> 27:01.913
has overstayed her visa for some time.

27:01.948 --> 27:04.326
That puts me in a really tough spot, Nick.

27:04.368 --> 27:05.500
I mean, I don't really care,

27:05.549 --> 27:08.398
but I'd hate to be seen
as obstructing justice.

27:10.689 --> 27:14.491
You know, I was sure I
wrote that plate number down.

27:16.667 --> 27:18.891
But I can't seem to find
my notebook anywhere.

27:24.409 --> 27:26.671
You're doing the right thing.

27:27.063 --> 27:29.131
(train bell clanging)

27:33.813 --> 27:34.972
What?

27:36.163 --> 27:37.564
Nothing.

27:38.592 --> 27:40.726
(click)

27:46.751 --> 27:49.119
Oh, my God, it looks like
"Call of Duty" down there.

27:49.174 --> 27:49.964
Who is it, the Bulgarians?

27:50.031 --> 27:51.955
No, Bulgarian forces carry AK-47s.

27:52.008 --> 27:53.680
Those are HK416s.

27:53.742 --> 27:55.504
Then who? Keaton?

27:55.556 --> 27:57.027
You really think he'd bring black ops here?

27:57.062 --> 27:57.872
I'd rather not find out.

27:57.929 --> 27:59.996
We need to get Winter to
a secure place, come on.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.178
Lock us down.

28:02.101 --> 28:04.689
Do you really believe what you just said?

28:04.757 --> 28:06.921
That your life doesn't matter?

28:07.006 --> 28:08.887
And you're willing to die for Shepherd?

28:08.931 --> 28:11.307
Or maybe you just like killing for her.

28:12.528 --> 28:15.775
- I don't like killing.
- It's your first instinct.

28:15.810 --> 28:16.990
The lobby guard's gun,

28:17.062 --> 28:19.997
the letter opener, Jeffrey Kantor.

28:20.087 --> 28:21.821
When we first met, you killed six cops.

28:21.881 --> 28:23.801
That's not the first night we met.

28:24.580 --> 28:27.546
We have a whole life together
that you chose to erase!

28:32.056 --> 28:33.945
I see the way you look at me.

28:34.687 --> 28:36.721
You think I'm a sociopath.

28:38.794 --> 28:40.809
Well, if I am, it's because you...

28:40.874 --> 28:42.745
you taught me how.

28:43.518 --> 28:45.855
And when you left,
Shepherd finished the job.

28:48.334 --> 28:49.594
(Weller) Keaton!

28:50.338 --> 28:51.823
Stand down!

28:52.738 --> 28:54.618
We're not handing over Winter!

28:55.949 --> 28:57.783
- Keaton...
- (explosion)

28:59.037 --> 29:02.138
(coughing)

29:02.181 --> 29:04.014
Are you okay?

29:04.182 --> 29:06.384
(gunfire)

29:13.784 --> 29:16.390
(beeping)

29:16.425 --> 29:17.819
Roman...

29:19.154 --> 29:22.752
Look... for what it's worth,

29:22.846 --> 29:24.624
I'm sorry you lost your sister.

29:24.698 --> 29:27.327
- If I knew...
- You knew.

29:27.502 --> 29:32.165
Then if I could go back
and do it all again,

29:32.231 --> 29:35.632
I would do it all so differently.

29:36.587 --> 29:38.388
What are you saying?

29:38.423 --> 29:40.157
(alarm blaring)

29:42.127 --> 29:43.460
The door's still locked.

29:43.541 --> 29:46.503
They found Cyndie. We're out of time.

29:48.126 --> 29:49.208
They're headed right for us.

29:49.261 --> 29:51.804
They're shutting all the
security doors, sealing us in.

29:52.275 --> 29:54.629
I'll handle them. Stay
with the code breaker,

29:54.711 --> 29:56.330
get the microchip, and get out of here.

29:56.401 --> 29:58.112
Roman...

29:58.169 --> 29:59.543
they don't know they're in a war.

29:59.578 --> 30:02.079
(alarm continuing)

30:03.736 --> 30:05.461
Move.

30:05.496 --> 30:07.173
(distant shouting)

30:08.353 --> 30:10.554
(gunfire)

30:20.504 --> 30:22.880
(modulated voice) <i>...or stay

30:22.973 --> 30:24.651
<i>of becoming the biggest

30:31.888 --> 30:32.556
Patterson.

30:32.618 --> 30:33.636
Hey, it's Jane.

30:33.691 --> 30:35.754
- I, uh... I have the chip.
- What? What chip?

30:35.789 --> 30:37.648
I'm in the R&D lab at Bradley Dynamics.

30:37.702 --> 30:38.869
Roman and I are stealing a chip,

30:38.917 --> 30:40.845
like a prototype, and it's the final piece

30:40.931 --> 30:42.670
<i>of Sandstorm's plan, and we
need to see what's on it.</i>

30:42.758 --> 30:44.574
Okay, got it, you need a chip whisperer.

30:44.636 --> 30:47.516
- Okay, what does it look like?
- <i>Like a small hard drive</i>

30:47.586 --> 30:49.651
with a slot that matches
the connections on the chip.

30:49.686 --> 30:51.669
- Uh, I think I found it.
- <i>All right.</i>

30:51.704 --> 30:53.435
<i>Plug in, I will upload the data,</i>

30:53.484 --> 30:55.121
<i>and we'll see what's on it.</i>

30:55.165 --> 30:56.566
Okay.

30:59.429 --> 31:01.063
(grunting)

31:02.365 --> 31:03.298
(gunshots)

31:07.203 --> 31:08.137
(hammer clicks)

31:14.644 --> 31:15.916
Got him.

31:16.913 --> 31:19.180
(gunfire, Winter screaming)

31:19.215 --> 31:20.319
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

31:20.385 --> 31:21.834
Don't shoot!

31:22.145 --> 31:23.501
Don't shoot!

31:23.863 --> 31:25.121
- Don't shoot!
- (gun clicking)

31:25.156 --> 31:27.073
- Drop your weapon.
- Don't shoot!

31:27.123 --> 31:28.605
You shot one of your own men.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.037
What the hell is going on?

31:31.703 --> 31:32.966
(Patterson) <i>Jane, you still there?</i>

31:33.044 --> 31:34.678
Yeah, look, we're only at 1%.

31:34.743 --> 31:35.840
Why is it moving so slow?

31:35.920 --> 31:37.447
It's not, this is light speed.

31:37.487 --> 31:39.649
The code on the chip must be massive.

31:41.604 --> 31:43.205
(grunting)

31:46.476 --> 31:48.143
(grunting)

31:51.848 --> 31:54.449
(young Jane) Stop! Don't hurt him!

31:54.484 --> 31:57.652
Leave him alone! Stop it!

31:57.687 --> 31:59.254
- (screaming)
- Stop it!

32:01.958 --> 32:03.525
(gasps)

32:03.560 --> 32:05.393
Let me see. Ian.

32:05.428 --> 32:10.732
♪♪

32:13.636 --> 32:15.871
Whoa... what just happened? Jane?

32:18.875 --> 32:20.959
Put your weapon down!

32:20.994 --> 32:23.231
- Now, why would I do that?
- Why would we shoot you?

32:23.266 --> 32:25.264
Because you think I'm trying to shoot you.

32:25.357 --> 32:27.514
Look, I hate to break it to
you, but these aren't my guys.

32:27.549 --> 32:29.104
He did just shoot one of 'em.

32:29.139 --> 32:31.244
Look, I don't have a gun,
so, you know, you guys...
