His name is Anok,
the Boy with
the Bleeding Heart.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.483
He was the second son
of the pharaoh.

11:35.571 --> 11:39.689
And according to legend,
Anok’s older brother, Meti,
fell off his horse,

11:39.783 --> 11:43.822
and Anok trampled him to death
to ensure that he would ascend
to the throne.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.996
Anok insisted
that his brother’s injuries
were the result of the fall,

11:48.083 --> 11:53.669
but the pharaoh didn’t believe
him and he went into a rage
and he cut off Anok’s head.

11:53.755 --> 11:56.963
He became known as the Boy
with the Bleeding Heart
because his grief was two-fold—

11:57.050 --> 12:01.259
grief for the death
of his brother and grief
for the loss of his father’s love.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.507
And what does this have to do
with the murder?

12:03.599 --> 12:06.841
Anok is supposed to be here
at the Jefferson/an on loan
from the Egyptian government.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.717
He ’8 going on exhibit Friday.
[ Breathing Deeply]

12:08.812 --> 12:12.100
But I should have let
Dr. Brennan tell you that.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.518
[ Saroyan ]
Why wasn ’t he reported missing?
[Brennan] I don’t know.

12:14.610 --> 12:17.647
I’ve called Booth.
We have to talk to the curator.

12:19.323 --> 12:22.565
Why are you here?
Movie. I’m just
watching the movie.

12:22.659 --> 12:25.651
So I’m like some kind of experiment
that you need to supervise?

12:25.787 --> 12:28.654
No, Ijust thought
if you needed me—
Do I look stupid?

12:28.749 --> 12:30.740
Because I’m not, Lance.

12:30.834 --> 12:34.873
In fact, there’s lots of people
who think I’m scary smart.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.625
[ Muttering ]
Not about men apparently.

12:42.638 --> 12:45.095
[Man ]
Her lab is upstairs,
on the right.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.138
Now, the Anok exhibit
opens on Friday.

12:47.225 --> 12:51.343
So there’s very little chance
Dr. Kaswell just let Anok get up
and walk out of her lab.

12:51.438 --> 12:55.556
Well, of course not.
Reanimation, while extremely
entertaining, is impossible.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.733
A cellular death
is cellular death.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.276
When was the last time
you saw Dr. Kaswell?

13:00.364 --> 13:02.275
Um, I guess
a day or so.

13:02.366 --> 13:06.109
She’s just been behind closed
doors with Anok while I’ve been
helping out with the dioramas,

13:06.203 --> 13:08.114
which have been a nightmare.

13:08.205 --> 13:12.574
In one scene, they painted
a group of female musicians,
and they have toes.

13:12.668 --> 13:16.286
Toe differentiation
in Egyptian art didn’t happen
until much later.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.503
Particularly in women.
I know, right?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.626
It’s fascinating.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.550
[ Knocks ]
Dr. Kaswell?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.341
She hates to be disturbed.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.842
[Knocks]

13:28.976 --> 13:31.058
Dr. Kaswell?

Well, it’s locked.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.099
She’s always here
at this hour. Always.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.099
And she would never
lock herself in.
We should get the key.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.647
Of course.
[ Nervous Laugh]

13:40.737 --> 13:42.853
Ow.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.906
Whoo, look at that.
It’s a mummy’s coffin.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.484
Yes. Beautiful, isn’t it?

13:50.497 --> 13:53.455
I can’t believe
she’s not here.

Be careful with that.
it’s priceless.

- [Booth] Geez/
- Oh! Dr. Kaswell!

14:13.270 --> 14:15.135
Yeah, that would
have been my guess.

[ Saroyan ] The F.B.l. ’3

looking for e vidence.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.857
I can’t believe
Dr. Kaswell is dead.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.818
I just met her a couple
of months ago at a party.
She seemed nice.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.870
She was pleasant,
but an unexceptional
anthropologist,

14:33.957 --> 14:35.913
and obviously
quite careless.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.913
Perhaps, but it’s sad
nonetheless, Dr. Brennan,

14:39.004 --> 14:41.586
to lose one of our own here
at the Jeffersonian.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.172
Of course.
Truth be told, we kind of
flirted with each other.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.545
Not appropriate,
Dr. Hodgins.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.548
Dr. Kaswell’s blood’s
a match for the spray
we found on the mummy.

14:49.639 --> 14:53.006
There’s some metal flakes
at the injury site. You say
the word, I’ll take ’em.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.682
One moment.

14:56.521 --> 15:00.890
The weapon appears to have
penetrated the eye and then
entered the frontal lobe.

15:00.984 --> 15:04.602
There’s damage to
the superior orbital fissure
and sphenoid.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.028
It must have Iacerated
the internal carotid artery.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.777
That would be consistent
with the arterial spurt.

15:09.868 --> 15:13.781
Given the injuries, the killer
must have used a narrow,
blunt-edged instrument.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.204
The metal shavings might help us
identify the murder weapon.

You can see blood traces

15:27.010 --> 15:29.752

was hidden in his chest.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.303
I extracted some metal shavings
for Dr. Hodgins.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.177
Perhaps the murderer
used the same weapon
that killed Dr. Kaswell...

15:35.268 --> 15:36.974
to open Anok’s chest.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.269
Dr. Kaswell had been studying
this mummy for weeks.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.563
She must have known
what was inside his chest.

15:41.650 --> 15:45.359
The Egyptian government
wouldn’t allow any invasive
examination of Anok.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.403
- And there was nothing
in her notes?
- Her notes were missing.

15:48.532 --> 15:52.571
[Booth] So you were overseeing
the exhibit, lI/lr. Turnbu/l?
[ lI/lan ] Uh, administrating.

15:52.661 --> 15:55.323
I was the, uh, go-between
coordinating things...

15:55.413 --> 15:58.871
with Dr. Kaswell and, of course,
the Egyptian National Museum.

15:58.959 --> 16:02.247
The Egyptians lent Anok
to the Jeffersonian.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.623
He survived 3,000 years
in the Egyptian desert,

16:04.714 --> 16:06.705
but he couldn’t make it
two weeks in DC.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.291
- Hmm.
- Dr. Kaswell’s notes
were missing.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.422
I assume she took notes.

16:11.513 --> 16:14.971
Of course. She had to turn
them all over to me...

16:15.058 --> 16:17.265
so that I could give them
to the Egyptians.

16:17.394 --> 16:20.431
That was part of the deal.
Well, we’re gonna need all
the notes that she gave you.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.853
Of course.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.807
Did she mention finding
anything in Anok’s chest?

16:24.901 --> 16:27.233
Chest? No.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.858
No invasive examinations
were approved by the Egyptians.

16:30.949 --> 16:35.989
It’s not uncommon for different
departments to vie for funds for
exhibits, is it, Mr. Turnbull?

16:36.079 --> 16:41.164
Uh, no. But as you can attest,
Dr. Brennan, scientists
usually don’t kill for them.

16:41.251 --> 16:45.415
Sure. I’mjust curious.
Was anyone angry at Kaswell
because she did get the funds?

out through my nose...

17:53.490 --> 17:55.481

than that.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.736
From the swab
of Dr. Kaswell’s eye.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.318

18:00.413 --> 18:03.075
Well, not exactly.

18:03.166 --> 18:08.081
See this? The tool used to stab
Dr. Kaswell left traces
of iron and carbon.

18:08.171 --> 18:11.163
And to a lesser extent,
silicon, manganese
and phosphorous.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.132
Any of those things
scream “pee”?
Not that I’m aware.

18:14.219 --> 18:17.427
Ancient metalworkers turned
iron into steel by accident.

18:17.514 --> 18:20.802
They accidentally carburized
the iron while heating it
over charcoal,

18:20.892 --> 18:22.348
thus turning it
into low-grade steel.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.346
But they thought
that it was the mode...

18:24.437 --> 18:27.270
of quenching the molten metal
that hardened it.

18:27.357 --> 18:30.975
- The redheaded boy pees
on the molten metal.
- The iron turns to steel.

18:31.069 --> 18:34.186
And our ancient metalworker
figured that the little redhead
did the trick.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.772
- It’s an instant
old wives’ tale.
- Wait.

18:36.908 --> 18:40.241
I didn’t know they had
redheads in ancient Egypt.
They didn’t.

18:40.328 --> 18:44.697
It was ancient Rome.
Our murder weapon
was forged in ancient Rome.

18:48.628 --> 18:52.712
Dr. Wheaton ’s department has
a very extensive collection
of Roman too/s:

18:52.799 --> 18:55.666

18:55.760 --> 18:58.968
Eggheads killing
each other over exhibits

The King Tut exhibit
was immensely popular.
But, Bones,

19:01.683 --> 19:05.676

learn from going to a museum
is how to sleep standing up.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.056
All right?
Pretty simple.

19:09.733 --> 19:13.317
So, I did a little checking
on Hacker, by the way.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.895
Forty-two, never been married.
Just in case you’re interested.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.276

That’s all.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.039
And if you’re gonna go out
with Hacker, then you guys

Because I’m what

19:39.679 --> 19:42.921
I’m sure neither of us

19:45.268 --> 19:48.260
Trust me, Agent Booth,
I had no quarrel
with Dr. Kaswell.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.811
Real/y? Because according
to witnesses,

19:49.898 --> 19:52.480
you were arguing with her
in the middle of the Titan exhibit.

19:52.609 --> 19:56.898
He means Titian. Titian was a
16th-century Renaissance painter
from the Italian school, Booth.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.365
- Titans were ancient
Greek gods—
- Okay

19:59.449 --> 20:01.360
I yelled at Dr. Kaswell.

20:01.451 --> 20:04.739
Leslie was gloating because she
got the funding and I didn’t.
I’m human. I got angry.

20:04.829 --> 20:09.493
So stealing her beef-jerky man
was just some way of wrecking
her exhibit and seeking revenge.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.620
But things,
they just got out of hand.
And before you know it—

20:11.711 --> 20:15.920
A gouge is missing,
Dr. Wheaton.

21:21.698 --> 21:25.441
Hey, look what I found.
Three different particulates
within the chest cavity.

21:25.535 --> 21:30.871
We got crushed mammal bone,
kermes insect and woad legume.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.411
Animal, vegetable
and mineral.
Yep.

21:33.543 --> 21:36.956
Actually, that would be two
animals and a vegetable because
bone is organic, not a mineral.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.173
Oh, my God.

21:39.257 --> 21:44.672
The three particulates are
totally different, but they’re
actually the exact same thing.

21:49.267 --> 21:52.304
[Ange/a ]
Woad, kermes insect and bone...

21:52.395 --> 21:55.102
were all used by
the ancient Egyptians
to make paint.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.896
I learned this
when I was in art school.

21:56.983 --> 22:01.443
Bone for white,
kermes insect for red,
and woad for indigo.

22:01.571 --> 22:04.563
So we just can’t make out colors
anymore because of decomp.
Right.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.364
Dr. Brennan thought perhaps
the compaction was left
by a canopic jar.

22:07.452 --> 22:10.194
No. They didn’t paint those.
They weren’t important.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.199
It would have been like
painting TuppenNare.

Yeah, but something was painted.
What would have been painted?

And why did somebody
hide it inside his body?

22:17.754 --> 22:21.872
Well, it must ha ve
been important.
And it needed to last forever.

22:21.966 --> 22:26.756
So if I can scan the cavity and
find out where the paint seeped
into the different tissues,

22:26.846 --> 22:30.964
- lm/ght be able to reconstruct
what was in Anok’s chest.
- [ Device Beeps ]

22:31.059 --> 22:34.551
This is Azita Jabbari from
the Egyptian National Museum.

22:34.646 --> 22:38.230
- Turn off that light.
- What? Wait a minute.
We just discovered—

22:38.316 --> 22:41.274
We have not authorized
any invasive or investigative
procedures on Anok.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.477
Ms. Jabbari
wants her mummy back.

22:43.571 --> 22:47.610
The Boy With the Bleeding Heart
goes back to Cairo today.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.612
Unless you would like
to start a feud between
our two governments.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.128
Anok is a national treasure
on loan to your country.

23:06.219 --> 23:09.211
According to our agreement,
we can revoke the permit
at any time.

23:09.305 --> 23:13.218
I understand your government’s
concern, but he’s safe
in our Medico-Legal Lab.

23:13.309 --> 23:16.426
The low humidity
and temperature in the lab
are optimum conditions.

23:16.521 --> 23:20.013
Dr. Brennan, with
all due respect, you have
no legal grounds to keep him.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.565
Yes, we do. Anok is evidence
in a murder investigation.

23:22.652 --> 23:26.816
Whoever killed Dr. Kaswell
stole something
from inside the mummy.

23:26.906 --> 23:30.023
Any idea what was inside
that was worth killing for?

23:30.118 --> 23:32.700
Have you examined
the CAT scans?

23:35.415 --> 23:36.951
What CAT scans?

23:37.041 --> 23:39.293
A few days ago, I granted
Dr. Kaswell’s request...

23:39.377 --> 23:41.538
to perform CAT scans
on Anok.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.870
The films should be
in Dr. Kaswell’s files.

23:43.965 --> 23:48.129
Dr. Kaswell’s lab was searched.
The files are missing.

23:50.263 --> 23:53.175
Then ask the young man
who worked for Dr. Kaswell.
He sent the request.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.725
“I work for Dr. Kaswell at
the Jeffersonian Institution,

24:01.816 --> 24:04.603
“and I am writing to request
autobiographical information
on the man...

24:04.694 --> 24:08.061
who funded the exhumation
of Anok’s tomb.”

24:08.156 --> 24:11.148
I checked with the museum.
You never worked
for Dr. Kaswell.

24:11.284 --> 24:13.616
That’s why I’m here?
Well, that
and other reasons.

24:13.703 --> 24:16.115
She was murdered.
So, start talking.

24:16.205 --> 24:20.699
Okay. Technically,
I did not work for her,

24:20.793 --> 24:23.785
but Dr. Kaswell did agree
to be my doctoral adviser...

24:23.880 --> 24:26.337
at the antiquities
graduate program
at Georgetown.

24:26.466 --> 24:29.708
Very impressive.
Thank you. I’m very bright.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.009
Okay, bright boy, let’s just
stay on point, shall we?

24:32.096 --> 24:34.428
As soon as / got to D. 0.,

24:34.515 --> 24:37.678
Dr. Kaswell said that
she did not have the time
for me anymore—

24:37.769 --> 24:40.636
that she was too busy
prepping the Anok exhibit.

24:40.730 --> 24:43.893
But I knew all about Anok.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.814
I even wrote a paper on him
as an undergrad.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.188
Pissed you off, didn’t it—
that she wouldn’t let you help?

24:48.321 --> 24:50.152
No.
Mmm, no.

24:50.239 --> 24:54.323
Okay, yes.
But not enough to kill her.

24:54.410 --> 24:58.779
/ signed up as a museum intern
so / could pro ve my value to her.

24:58.873 --> 25:02.866
You thought if you helped her
with her work, she might change
her mind about advising you.

25:03.002 --> 25:07.166
It was my idea to do the
CAT scans on Anok. She thought
it was an excellent suggestion.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.338
So, you saw the films?

25:09.425 --> 25:12.087
No. I didn’t even know
she followed through.

25:12.178 --> 25:15.420
- But I would have killed
to see those images.
- Excuse me?

25:15.515 --> 25:17.722
But I didn’t.

- [ Patrons Chattering ]
- [ Man, Woman Laughing]

25:25.525 --> 25:28.483
Usually all you find
in a mummy’s torso
are pounded perfumes.

25:28.569 --> 25:31.652
Yeah, that’s all I’ve ever found.
Once a sandwich,
but of course it was stale.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.526
You found a sand— Oh.
[Laughs]

25:34.617 --> 25:36.232
You’re joking.

25:36.327 --> 25:38.033
That’s funny—
a sandwich.

25:38.121 --> 25:41.409
Because it’s highly unlikely
to find one in a mummy.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.660
[ Both Laughing]

25:43.751 --> 25:46.959
Did I tell you that
Anok has six fingers?

25:47.046 --> 25:48.957
Also highly unlikely.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.460
So, perhaps there is
a sandwich in him.

25:51.551 --> 25:55.009
[Laughs]
You know, no joke,
I have an uncle with four toes.

25:55.096 --> 25:56.882

You are good.

25:58.808 --> 26:01.675
He was watching a play-off game
while cutting the lawn.

26:01.811 --> 26:04.769
He had no regrets though.
Said it was a great game.
Okay.

26:04.856 --> 26:09.020
So, uh, what do you
wanna eat after this, uh,
appetizing conversation?

26:09.110 --> 26:11.567
Uh, Booth likes
to get the meat loaf.

26:11.654 --> 26:13.770
He has them take out
the hard-boiled egg...

26:13.865 --> 26:17.153
because his mother
used to tell him
it was a human eyeball.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.610
I gotta say, you and Booth—
it’s an unlikely partnership.

26:20.705 --> 26:24.038
I’d prefer not
to talk about Booth,
if you don’t mind.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.707
It’s fine by me. You’re
a far more interesting topic.

26:28.546 --> 26:31.754
I’d like to know the story
behind your guitar.

a Stratocaster in their office.

26:35.303 --> 26:37.294
I’m impressed.
You know the Stratocaster.

Yes. I had a victim who was
beaten to death with one.

26:39.849 --> 26:43.433

I am so sorry. They need me
back at the lab.

26:50.610 --> 26:54.273

That tends to take precedence
over meat loaf.

Well, Friday night
dinner— on me?

26:58.284 --> 27:01.526

Wait, this is his boss’s boss?
Was Booth upset?

27:29.190 --> 27:33.524
Yes. I don’t know why.
Brennan, this could screw up
the natural order of things.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.977
And Booth wishes that
you were going out
with him.

27:36.072 --> 27:39.940
I drink with him all the time.
But with Andrew,
there’s the potential for sex.

27:40.034 --> 27:41.695
And not with Booth?

27:43.246 --> 27:46.033
You said there was something
important you wanted me to see?

27:46.123 --> 27:48.375
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

27:48.459 --> 27:52.668
The paint residue was found
inside the compacted area
in Anok’s chest.

27:52.755 --> 27:55.542
Now, I laid a grid
over that area.

27:55.633 --> 28:00.127
Next, Hodgins inspected
each section of the grid
for chemical residue,

28:00.221 --> 28:02.928
assigning values based on
our color differential.

28:03.015 --> 28:06.098
It was kind of
like paint by numbers.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.018
Okay. Anyway.

28:10.106 --> 28:13.769
Bone for white,
kermes insect for red,

28:13.860 --> 28:16.351
and woad for indigo.

28:16.445 --> 28:20.404
Okay, now I reshaped, refined
and cropped the edges.

28:21.576 --> 28:24.363
And finally,
I removed the grid.
Hieroglyphs.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.445
Yeah. A negative impression.

28:27.540 --> 28:32.000

by the object that was
hidden inside the chest.

Very good!

28:35.089 --> 28:36.124

28:37.425 --> 28:41.384
Next, we take the object out
and we look on the bottom.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.007
And we have
the positive image
of the hieroglyphs.

28:44.140 --> 28:48.008
Amazing. But many of these
characters are incomplete.
Yeah.

had faded too much
and couldn’t be retrieved.

what was inside.

You are an excellent shrink.
You know you can help people.

She’s the person you love and
the person you have to trust.

30:28.536 --> 30:31.824
If Daisy’s gonna screw up,
you have to let her.
It’ll show you have faith in her.

taking care of her.

and more interesting,

If the CAT scan
were in color,

it’d be red
and really expensive.

A ruby.
Yeah. A giant ruby.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.862
[ Saroyan ]
it’s right where
Anok’s heart would be.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.868
Anok’s bleeding heart
must refer to the ruby.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.574
A stone that size
would be worth a fortune.

32:00.669 --> 32:03.001
Only someone
who saw the CAT scan
would have known about this.

32:03.089 --> 32:06.581
Dr. Kaswell’s grad student.
I mean, he’s the one
that requested the scans.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.882
Booth cleared him.
He was working on dioramas
at time of death.

32:08.969 --> 32:12.257
But Azita Jabbari, she knew
about them too. She gave
permission to have them done.

32:12.389 --> 32:17.474
Yeah, and she tried to get
Anok taken away from us
before we could finish investigating.

32:19.605 --> 32:23.063
This is insane. I have devoted
my life to preserving
my country’s antiquities.

32:23.150 --> 32:25.892
You knew about the CAT scan.
You had access to the mummy.

32:25.986 --> 32:29.319
I didn’t know about the ruby.
And if I did, I would have
insisted on additional security.

32:29.406 --> 32:33.900
That ruby is a national

but the ambassador
wanted me there.

as an alibi.

How’s that gonna help us
catch Kaswell’s killer?
It won’t.

Well, he was found in

You really don’t need me

I found something here.
A probative particulate?

35:27.126 --> 35:29.708
No, grease spot.

that you recently talked

Oh.
Oh.

35:51.191 --> 35:54.649
Well, he asked me what was
good to eat. And I mentioned
that you liked the meat loaf.

35:54.778 --> 35:59.021
Stop, right there. You said
you weren’t gonna talk about me,
and you talked about me.

35:59.116 --> 36:01.482
But I-I didn’t mean
to talk about you.

36:01.577 --> 36:04.694
I told him I didn’t want to,
but, you know,
I like that story.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.779
And I guess it just...
popped out.

Because... what goes on

have told a lot of people
the meat loaf story, right?

36:27.186 --> 36:30.849
So, I got a print off the linen.

through the database.

We found you evidence.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.652
This is ridiculous.
I didn’t kill Dr. Kaswell.

36:46.747 --> 36:49.955
You were in the building, Doc.
Your fingerprint was
on the priceless mummy.

36:50.084 --> 36:53.793
Then there’s been some mistake.
I would never have touched
something that valuable...

36:53.879 --> 36:56.586

have allowed it.

Okay. So, what happened, Doc?
I’m waiting. I’m all ears.

37:06.016 --> 37:09.053
I did go to see her
that night. Uh—

37:09.144 --> 37:11.851
I’d been a jerk—
jealous about her
getting the grant money.

37:11.939 --> 37:14.806
We’d been friends for years.
I wanted to apologize.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.939
We made up, and she wanted
to show me Anok, you know,
scientist to scientist.

37:19.029 --> 37:21.736
She opened Anok’s coffin,
and the mummy slipped.

37:21.824 --> 37:24.816
I-I-I reached out to stop it.
It was just a reflex.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.822
-Did she show you the CAT scans?
-Yes.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.491

But she swore me to secrecy.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.368
It was such an important find,
I wasn’t going
to betray her trust.

37:32.459 --> 37:34.836
Right, then after you saw them,
the mummy vanishes
with your fingerprint.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.208
Your friend dies, and these
scans— they just disappear.

37:38.298 --> 37:41.290
No, the scans were in her notes.
She showed them to me
before she submitted them.

37:41.385 --> 37:45.344
The scans that were
supposed to be submitted
to Dr. Steven Turnbull?

37:45.431 --> 37:48.173
He was the administrator.
Yes, they’d be in the notes
he turned over to you.

37:50.561 --> 37:53.928
He deliberately
withheld the scans.
Destroyed them is more likely.

37:54.022 --> 37:57.264
Okay? Turnbull’s spot
is number 10.

37:57.359 --> 38:00.271
So if he did it, he probably
put the mummy in his car
and he took off with it.

38:00.362 --> 38:02.944
I can’t imagine anyone
destroying an artifact
like that.
