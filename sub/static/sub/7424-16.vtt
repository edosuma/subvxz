<i>And she saved mine.</i>

00:06.895 --> 00:10.863

<i>But we know it won't be easy.</i>

00:10.865 --> 00:12.482
<i>Muirfield is still out there</i>

00:12.484 --> 00:13.983

I'd like you to meet my brother.
This is Darius.

00:26.786 --> 00:28.285
<i>It's your finger</i>
<i>on the trigger.</i>

00:30.689 --> 00:32.423
<i>Darius,</i>

00:32.424 --> 00:33.591
- I killed him.
<i>- If you didn't</i>

00:33.593 --> 00:34.892
<i>act when you did,</i>

00:34.894 --> 00:36.327

<i>Consolidated into a new unit,</i>

00:40.716 --> 00:42.333

the apprehension and prosecution

00:42.335 --> 00:44.552
of the son of a bitch
known as "the vigilante."

00:44.554 --> 00:46.704
And, yes, this is personal.

Oh.

Stop looking at
me like that

04:06.738 --> 04:09.423
because I have a job now,
and I can't be dopey at it.

04:09.425 --> 04:11.708
How am I looking at you?

04:11.710 --> 04:14.578
Like I never want
to leave this bed.

04:22.421 --> 04:23.771
Uh-oh.

04:23.773 --> 04:25.556
No, don't say "uh-oh."

You've got two missed calls

04:27.276 --> 04:29.276
and five texts
from Tess,

04:29.278 --> 04:31.695
Evan and Joe.

04:32.815 --> 04:34.982
From an hour ago.

04:56.721 --> 05:00.090
We've got deep lacerations
on the vic's face.

05:00.092 --> 05:02.392
Or what's left of it.
Looks like our killer again.

05:02.394 --> 05:04.127
The vigilante is
upping his game.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.296
We can't be sure yet.
I'll need to do

05:06.298 --> 05:08.115
a full workup
in the morgue before

05:08.117 --> 05:09.817
I can confirm anything.
Do it.

05:09.819 --> 05:12.469
How did we not catch this guy
before he killed again?

05:12.471 --> 05:13.654
We're working
on it, boss.

05:13.656 --> 05:14.738
We narrowed down
a list of suspects.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.190
Mostly felons who live
in the area.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.775
Sorry.
You're late.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.662
It's Saturday. I went
for a run without my phone.

05:21.664 --> 05:22.913
For three hours?

05:22.915 --> 05:25.165
Training for a marathon.

05:25.167 --> 05:26.416
I've wasted a lot of breath

05:26.418 --> 05:27.534
over the past few months
on whatever's

05:27.536 --> 05:30.320
gotten you so preoccupied.

05:30.322 --> 05:32.172
I suggest you get
your mind unoccupied

05:32.174 --> 05:33.257
and get back
in the game.

05:33.259 --> 05:34.258
You're part
of an elite team

05:34.260 --> 05:35.992
now, Chandler. Act like it.

05:40.164 --> 05:42.382
We sure this was our guy?

05:42.384 --> 05:43.467
You know something we don't?

05:43.469 --> 05:45.185
Murder happened out in the open.

05:45.187 --> 05:46.687
It's not his M.O.

05:46.689 --> 05:48.522
And like I told Tess
before you showed up,

05:48.524 --> 05:50.524
he's upping his game.

05:50.526 --> 05:52.476
Was he in the process

05:52.478 --> 05:54.895
- of committing a crime?
- No.

05:54.897 --> 05:58.232
In prior cases, it's been clear.
At least... it's been

05:58.234 --> 06:00.200
clear to me
that he has some sort

06:00.202 --> 06:02.819
of vigilante complex.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.821
He only strikes when an assault
is being perpetrated

06:04.823 --> 06:05.873
against an innocent victim.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.658
Carriage driver had priors, Cat.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.326
But he wasn't in the act of...

06:09.328 --> 06:10.661
And what is your answer
to the brutality

06:10.663 --> 06:12.546
of the crime fitting
his M.O. to the T?

06:12.548 --> 06:13.797
Have we considered
the possibility

06:13.799 --> 06:15.632
that it might be a copycat?

06:15.634 --> 06:18.218
You come up with that theory on
your three-hour run, Chandler?

06:18.220 --> 06:19.536
Give it a rest, Garnett.

06:19.538 --> 06:20.337
Kiss my ass, Vargas.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.255
Guys.

06:21.257 --> 06:23.340
- Guys.
- ADA Lowan.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.841
All right, listen up.
Good news.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.810
I know our hands have
been tied, to a degree,

06:26.812 --> 06:28.262
but not anymore.

06:28.264 --> 06:30.147
The Feds have given us
full funding

06:30.149 --> 06:33.233
to catch this monster
with whatever means necessary.

06:33.235 --> 06:35.352
Let's bring in the suspects
we've been circling,

06:35.354 --> 06:37.271
turn up the heat.

06:37.273 --> 06:38.689
I want this guy behind bars.

06:38.691 --> 06:40.524
Make our city safe again.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.526
Best way to make people
feel safe is to eliminate

06:42.528 --> 06:44.528
the problem--
let's kill this bastard.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.831
Is that the police chief
talking or a victim's brother?

06:49.233 --> 06:51.585
We need him alive,
and we will prosecute him

06:51.587 --> 06:53.453
to the full extent of the law.

06:53.455 --> 06:56.089
And the full extent of the law's
at the end of my barrel.

06:56.091 --> 06:57.424
Listen to me, Lieutenant.

06:57.426 --> 06:58.642
If we become vigilantes,

06:58.644 --> 07:00.577
then we are no better
than this guy.

07:00.579 --> 07:04.548
And I will prosecute any
vigilantes equally-- understood?

07:07.084 --> 07:09.753
Can I have a
word, Detective?

07:09.755 --> 07:12.222
Yeah.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.558
Something have you
questioning this one?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.526
Based on my case experience,

07:16.528 --> 07:18.812
the vigilante doesn't kill
innocent people.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.764
I'm not saying
he's a saint,

07:20.766 --> 07:22.482
but he did save a woman
from being raped.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.701
What about Joe's brother?

07:26.704 --> 07:28.238
And how convinced are you

07:28.240 --> 07:29.539
that this isn't the work
of the vigilante?

07:29.541 --> 07:32.108
Based on the messiness
of the crime scene

07:32.110 --> 07:34.044
and the amount of blood...

07:34.046 --> 07:36.496
he's usually more efficient
than that.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.948
Do I detect a tone of...

07:39.884 --> 07:41.218
...admiration?

07:41.220 --> 07:43.503
You detect a note of skepticism.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.505
I'm worried that we all
want to catch this guy

07:45.507 --> 07:47.474
so badly that we're willing
to overlook the facts

07:47.476 --> 07:49.059
on the ground.

07:49.061 --> 07:50.794
I wanted you
on this task force, Chandler.

07:50.796 --> 07:52.596
I thought your life experience

07:52.598 --> 07:54.631
would've sharpened
your world view.

07:54.633 --> 07:56.316
Maybe it's only clouded it.
I thought your life experience

07:56.318 --> 07:59.102
I don't need a debate
on this one; I need a team.

07:59.104 --> 08:02.406
Okay, I am trying...
I want our killer in custody.

08:02.408 --> 08:03.690
And if you value
your position

08:03.692 --> 08:05.409
on this task force, I expect

08:05.411 --> 08:07.977
you'll play an important
role in his capture.

on the carriage
driver's body?

08:28.471 --> 08:30.554
Something that might help
tie this to the vigilante?

08:30.556 --> 08:31.805
There was no DNA, period.

08:32.307 --> 08:34.758
The crime scene was absent
of any other DNA.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.977
Okay, so that proves it.
The absence of evidence

08:36.979 --> 08:38.929
isn't the presence of proof,
Catherine.

08:38.931 --> 08:40.313
I can't ignore
the markings

08:40.315 --> 08:42.131
that I've observed on the torso

08:42.133 --> 08:44.651
and the face that look a
lot like claw scrapings.

08:44.653 --> 08:46.153
I still need to run
some other tests

08:46.155 --> 08:47.687
to see if it compares
to other cases.

08:47.689 --> 08:49.439
Well, shouldn't you just
go to Joe

08:49.441 --> 08:51.307
and-and let him know
that you have doubts?

08:51.309 --> 08:53.443
You know that doubt
won't be enough for Joe.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.811
Until you have something
more concrete.

08:54.813 --> 08:57.480
Look, Cat, if I told
Joe that this murder

08:57.482 --> 08:59.315
was the work of
a something out there

08:59.317 --> 09:01.785
whose DNA isn't
entirely human,

09:01.787 --> 09:04.504
he'd likely have me packing up
my things by tomorrow.

09:04.506 --> 09:07.591
I thought you were gathering
evidence to prove that.

09:07.593 --> 09:09.593
And to seek absolution
from this crime,

09:09.595 --> 09:12.179
you really want me to suggest
that the man who killed

09:12.181 --> 09:14.397
Joe's brother might
not be a man at all?

09:14.399 --> 09:16.433
No.
No, I understand. I have to...

09:16.435 --> 09:19.853
bring them something more
than just a hunch.

09:19.855 --> 09:21.805
Like you said--
something concrete.

09:21.807 --> 09:23.690
Look, you know I'll support you

09:23.692 --> 09:26.193
if your theory turns out
to be true, but...

09:26.195 --> 09:27.727
I'm a scientist at heart.

09:27.729 --> 09:29.679
I go where the
evidence leads me.

09:29.681 --> 09:33.400
I wouldn't expect anything less.

09:51.603 --> 09:53.975
They didn't find your
DNA at the crime scene, but...

09:53.976 --> 09:55.976
the vic had slash marks
on his body

09:55.978 --> 09:58.663
oddly similar
to your claws.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.748
Obviously someone's
trying to set me up.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.200
Seems like it.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.085
It's too close
to be a coincidence.

10:04.087 --> 10:06.004
Somebody knows your patterns.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.305
But who would want to do that?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.257
The only thing I can
think of is Muirfield,

10:09.259 --> 10:10.658
but there's no way
they'd want to draw

10:10.660 --> 10:12.293
outside attention
to me like this.

10:12.295 --> 10:14.212
Yeah, not when they're
trying to cover you up.

10:14.214 --> 10:17.331
It doesn't make sense.
I don't know  who else it could be.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.717
Here we are starting
our relationship

10:19.719 --> 10:22.503
and someone is already
trying to destroy us.

10:25.392 --> 10:29.009
Well, you know,
they won't be the last ones.

10:29.011 --> 10:32.063
Stupid of me to think,
even for a moment,

10:32.065 --> 10:35.116
that the outside
world doesn't exist.

10:35.118 --> 10:37.685
That we could hole up,
stay in bed,

10:37.687 --> 10:41.406
order-order take-out, and
talk grade point averages.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.642
Catherine, come on,
it's not stupid.

10:46.161 --> 10:47.745
You're not the only one

10:47.747 --> 10:49.881
guilty of wishful
thinking, okay?

10:51.533 --> 10:55.253
You know, I spent all day
searching for a place

10:55.255 --> 10:57.088
for you and me
to be alone together,

10:57.090 --> 10:59.507
while half the city
is trying to hunt me down.

10:59.509 --> 11:01.542
We have to promise

11:01.544 --> 11:04.395
not to make each other careless.

11:06.014 --> 11:08.349
It's just when I'm
with you, I...

11:08.351 --> 11:09.617
I feel strong,

11:09.619 --> 11:13.504
like... I can take them all on.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.324
Are you sure?

11:17.126 --> 11:18.726
Because, in this life,

11:18.728 --> 11:23.164
you're constantly looking
over your shoulder.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.199
Yes.

11:25.201 --> 11:26.584
Okay, then you're right.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.537
We are stronger together
than we are apart.

11:31.123 --> 11:33.424
We have to find
something to clear you.

11:36.346 --> 11:39.464
Look, even if we prove
that I didn't kill

11:39.466 --> 11:41.599
this carriage driver,
we have to try and catch

11:41.601 --> 11:43.351
this guy that's
trying to set me up.

11:43.353 --> 11:45.052
Okay, first things first.

11:45.054 --> 11:46.387
Evan didn't find any DNA,

11:46.389 --> 11:49.474
so we have to find
something else.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.775
Okay.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.059
Vincent, this is

11:52.061 --> 11:53.444
our life now.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.363
And if that means
we're gonna have to fight

11:55.365 --> 11:57.482
every day to keep it,
then that's what we'll do.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.952
But I am not gonna
beat myself up for being happy.

12:00.954 --> 12:04.205
After everything we've been
through, I'm not gonna do that.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.809
You're amazing, you know that?

12:08.994 --> 12:11.629
You are-- you have
absolutely no fear.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.998
I should be afraid.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.283
We both should.

12:16.285 --> 12:18.719
You have no idea
how passionate Joe is,

12:18.721 --> 12:20.287
how vengeful.

12:20.289 --> 12:23.474
He thinks you killed
his brother in cold blood.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.593
He's not gonna stop until...

12:25.595 --> 12:28.329
Yeah, he catches me,
I understand.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.431
No, he doesn't
just want to catch you.

12:30.433 --> 12:33.384
He wants to kill you.

12:43.328 --> 12:45.062
I think I might've
just found something

12:45.064 --> 12:47.982
that'll set him
on a different course.

13:31.543 --> 13:33.544
We have an assignment for you.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.763
Muirfield.
Agent Kyle, was it?

13:35.765 --> 13:37.465
Kyle's fine.

13:37.467 --> 13:39.133
There's no reason for you and I

13:39.135 --> 13:40.568
to be formal any longer.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.470
We're on the same team.

13:42.472 --> 13:45.006
So my assignment is...?

13:45.008 --> 13:46.757
Do whatever you can
to keep this police Task Force

13:46.759 --> 13:47.808
from catching the vigilante.

13:47.810 --> 13:50.311
More like serial killer

13:50.313 --> 13:52.063
after last week's maulings.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.599
But I thought your main goal
was to apprehend him?

13:54.601 --> 13:55.600
For us to apprehend him.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.717
And you and I both know

13:56.719 --> 13:58.603
this thing is
a lot more than a "him."

13:58.605 --> 14:00.521
But it's paramount
we get there first.

14:00.523 --> 14:02.440
If the police catch it,
they'll bring it into custody,

14:02.442 --> 14:04.575
and put it through
a very public justice system.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.277
And Muirfield will be exposed.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.328
And the world will know

14:07.330 --> 14:09.080
about your
colossal mistake.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.616
So you want me
to tamper with evidence?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.951
If need be.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.938
Will that be a problem
for you, Dr. Marks?

14:19.424 --> 14:21.509
Not if it's the only way
to make sure

14:21.511 --> 14:24.095
that everyone's safe
from this ever happening again.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.463
Excellent.

14:26.548 --> 14:27.598
This cab's taken.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.849
Find yourself another ride.

14:34.437 --> 14:37.404
It's a spike from a medieval
weapon called a morning star.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.176
Based on the crime
scene I saw,

14:39.178 --> 14:40.895
that is definitely part
of the murder weapon.

14:40.897 --> 14:42.730
So that's one of the spikes
from the star?

14:42.732 --> 14:44.882
Yep. Uh, my buddy from
the history department

14:44.884 --> 14:47.018
said it came into
widespread use around

14:47.020 --> 14:48.936
the beginning
of the 14th century.

14:49.251 --> 14:51.301
Okay, whoever this person is

14:51.303 --> 14:54.137
who's trying to set you up,
they are definitely psychotic.

14:54.139 --> 14:56.765
Who would go to these lengths
to try and set me up?

14:56.766 --> 14:59.495
I don't know,
but, uh, there's an insignia

14:59.561 --> 15:01.428
on the underside

15:01.430 --> 15:02.629
of the spike.

15:02.631 --> 15:04.097
Here.

15:04.099 --> 15:05.399
Did your friend
know what it meant?

15:05.401 --> 15:07.150
No, but he gave me

15:07.152 --> 15:10.320
the name of an antiquities
dealer in Williamsburg.

15:10.322 --> 15:12.555
Said this guy knows everything
about medieval weaponry.

15:12.557 --> 15:13.607
Okay, take a picture of it

15:13.609 --> 15:15.826
and go see him,
and I'll take that

15:15.828 --> 15:17.060
to Evan.

15:17.062 --> 15:18.612
He won't be able
to deny the truth

15:18.614 --> 15:19.863
that the vigilante had nothing

15:19.865 --> 15:21.564
to do with this murder.

15:23.534 --> 15:26.736
♪

15:26.738 --> 15:28.622
So, did you pick up your vest?

15:28.624 --> 15:30.240
I did, yeah.

15:30.242 --> 15:32.122
- What do you think?
- It's real nice.

15:32.961 --> 15:34.210
Vargas, have a minute?

15:34.212 --> 15:35.217
Yeah, give me
a second, boss.

15:35.218 --> 15:36.384
I'm having a buckle problem.

15:36.386 --> 15:38.353
That can wait.
Oh, see, you say that,

15:38.355 --> 15:39.604
but you won't be
the one on a raid

15:39.606 --> 15:40.822
with her pants at her ankles.

15:41.890 --> 15:43.825
Coming.

15:46.729 --> 15:49.197
What's up?
Look, I, uh,

15:49.199 --> 15:51.549
I appreciate your support
on this, Tess.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.234
Always, Joe.

15:53.236 --> 15:54.585
Which is why I told Gabe

15:54.587 --> 15:56.738
you'd check the cold
leads on the vigilante.

15:56.740 --> 15:59.357
But we're about to head out
on some sweeps.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.358
I know.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.377
I need you on this instead.

16:03.279 --> 16:04.345
Are you kidding?

16:04.347 --> 16:05.663
You're sidelining me?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.548
Having me follow up
with a bunch of kooks?

16:07.550 --> 16:11.135
Gabe wants every tip
we've received followed up.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.154
It's not a bogus assignment,

16:13.156 --> 16:15.556
no matter what that
scowl on your face says.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.763
The sooner you get started,

16:21.765 --> 16:23.214
the sooner you'll be finished.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.767
Are you punishing me 'cause Cat

16:25.769 --> 16:26.768
was late to the crime scene?

16:26.770 --> 16:28.052
'Cause she's questioning

16:28.054 --> 16:29.220
whether this attack
was even our killer?

16:29.222 --> 16:31.239
I told you, she's not
my partner anymore.

16:31.241 --> 16:34.075
Not in the mood to argue
with you, Vargas.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.060
Just 'cause we have...

16:36.062 --> 16:39.247
what we have, does not mean
you can question my authority

16:39.249 --> 16:40.381
here at work.

16:40.383 --> 16:42.033
I'm questioning you as my boss.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.702
I see.

16:45.788 --> 16:47.588
Okay. So then, as your boss,

16:47.590 --> 16:49.540
I say do your damn job.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.243
Let's go.

17:05.093 --> 17:06.660
This is the Waxford Insignia,

17:06.662 --> 17:09.546
most probably
from the Spike Mace Club.

17:09.548 --> 17:12.182
Waxford was a weapons dealer
in England at the turn

17:12.184 --> 17:13.599
of the 14th century.

17:13.602 --> 17:15.185
How many of these
are still in existence?

17:15.186 --> 17:16.887
Are you two cops?

17:16.888 --> 17:18.222
Investigators.

17:18.223 --> 17:19.857
We work with cops.

17:19.858 --> 17:23.343
There's probably ten
to 15 left in the world.

17:23.345 --> 17:24.678
Any in New York?

17:24.680 --> 17:26.029
I'd guess three or four.

17:26.031 --> 17:27.681
Next to Berlin, New York's

17:27.683 --> 17:29.032
the mecca for arcane weaponry.

17:29.034 --> 17:31.869
Is there any way
we might be able to find the guy

17:31.871 --> 17:33.036
that owns that piece?

17:33.038 --> 17:35.873
I thought you
were investigators.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.992
So... investigate.

17:44.132 --> 17:46.300
Listen, man,

17:46.302 --> 17:51.088
um, I'm a really
nice guy, okay, but...

17:51.090 --> 17:54.207
you see my, uh...

17:54.209 --> 17:56.260
my friend over there,

17:56.262 --> 18:00.147
he can get a little
aggressive if he's set off.

18:00.149 --> 18:02.015
So why don't you just
do us all a favor

18:02.017 --> 18:03.851
and give us a list
of the collectors

18:03.853 --> 18:05.102
in New York City, huh?

18:05.104 --> 18:06.770
Actually, these only
go up for sale

18:06.772 --> 18:08.655
at high-end auction houses,

18:08.657 --> 18:10.557
so...

18:10.559 --> 18:11.775
give me a few minutes,

18:11.777 --> 18:14.060
and I'll print
a list out for you.

18:14.062 --> 18:15.946
That'd be great.

18:15.948 --> 18:18.198
♪

18:29.093 --> 18:31.461
So, absent of any DNA
at the crime scene,

18:31.463 --> 18:33.263
I give you the
murder weapon.

18:33.265 --> 18:35.499
Or at least a piece of it.

18:35.501 --> 18:37.851
Is that concrete
enough to bring to Joe?

18:37.853 --> 18:38.919
Where'd you find this?

18:38.921 --> 18:40.137
You searched the crime scene,

18:40.139 --> 18:41.555
but how closely did you look

18:41.557 --> 18:42.840
at the carriage or the horse?

18:42.842 --> 18:44.641
This way, you don't have to show

18:44.643 --> 18:46.226
the cross-species evidence

18:46.228 --> 18:48.061
to prove that we're
hunting the wrong guy.

18:48.063 --> 18:50.113
You're going a long way
to protect this thing.

18:50.115 --> 18:52.599
I'm trying to find
the real killer.

18:52.601 --> 18:54.234
Is that what this is?

18:54.236 --> 18:55.953
What else would it be?

18:58.239 --> 18:59.656
I found cross-species

18:59.658 --> 19:02.075
DNA on your scarf.

19:02.077 --> 19:03.610
What?

19:03.612 --> 19:06.279
You left it here.

19:06.281 --> 19:08.248
So you tested it?

19:08.250 --> 19:09.666
It would explain
why you've been lying

19:09.668 --> 19:11.034
to me all these months.

19:11.036 --> 19:12.970
About the bike messenger attack,

19:12.972 --> 19:15.455
about chasing it in the subway;
why it saved you.

19:15.457 --> 19:17.123
Evan, you can't
really think that I...

19:17.125 --> 19:19.009
Are you harboring
this thing, Catherine?

19:19.011 --> 19:21.178
Evan, you are way out of line.

19:21.180 --> 19:23.981
Well, what the hell is its DNA
doing on your scarf?

19:23.983 --> 19:25.966
How many vigilante crime scenes

19:25.968 --> 19:28.185
have I been at?
It is not a vigilante.

19:28.187 --> 19:29.319
It's a murderer.

19:29.321 --> 19:31.188
A creature, Catherine.

19:31.190 --> 19:34.157
Evan, you know me.

19:34.159 --> 19:36.910
You know that I would
never do anything

19:36.912 --> 19:40.280
to hurt myself or anyone else.

19:40.282 --> 19:42.482
Don't you?

19:43.818 --> 19:45.819
Did you examine Tess's clothes?

19:45.821 --> 19:47.087
Or your own?

19:47.089 --> 19:48.956
We have been chasing
this thing for months.

19:48.958 --> 19:50.774
Why wouldn't we have

19:50.776 --> 19:53.260
trace evidence of him
on any of us?

19:53.262 --> 19:56.697
Catherine, all... all I want
is your honesty.

19:56.699 --> 19:59.600
When did we stop
believing each other?

19:59.602 --> 20:02.886
Whatever you're going through,
it's not too late.

20:02.888 --> 20:06.306
I will protect you.

20:06.308 --> 20:09.026
Everything I've ever done was
to protect you.

20:09.028 --> 20:11.845
You want me to believe
that you going behind my back,

20:11.847 --> 20:16.366
stealing my personal belongings,
is-is because you have my back?

20:16.368 --> 20:18.685
I just want the truth.

20:18.687 --> 20:20.988
The truth is,
the vigilante saved your life.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.940
Cat, if... if I find out

20:22.942 --> 20:24.791
that you're helping
this thing...

20:24.793 --> 20:27.210
Well, just know this:

20:27.212 --> 20:30.747
I will do whatever it takes
to get him.

20:30.749 --> 20:34.468
I understand.

20:52.923 --> 20:56.180
I left my scarf behind
because my head was...

20:56.500 --> 20:59.501
somewhere else,
and-and Evan tested it.

20:59.503 --> 21:01.492
So, Evan knows you're
connected to Vincent?

21:01.493 --> 21:04.127
I don't know what he can prove,
but he definitely believes it.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.630
He basically warned me that,
if I was protecting you,

21:06.632 --> 21:08.765
he would take matters
into his own hands.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.685
So, if Evan now knows there's
a connection between us...

21:11.687 --> 21:13.019
And the ADA's got access

21:13.021 --> 21:15.772
to every surveillance camera
in the city...

21:15.774 --> 21:18.024
And Joe's got a couple of loose
cannons in Garnett and Newell,

21:18.026 --> 21:20.193
who won't let a few little laws
get in their way...

21:20.195 --> 21:22.512
they are going to find you,
Vincent.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.064
And soon.

21:24.066 --> 21:27.067
Please, tell me you guys found
something that'll help.

21:27.069 --> 21:30.853
Uh, well, uh, JT and I
checked out every antique buyer

21:30.855 --> 21:34.482
who ever bid on one
of these kinds of weapons...

21:34.654 --> 21:36.454
And came up with nothing.

21:36.456 --> 21:39.824
Okay, as much
as we have to catch this guy,

21:39.826 --> 21:41.409
I think we're out of time.

21:42.121 --> 21:43.754
We let too many people
get close.

21:43.756 --> 21:47.241
We may have passed the point
of no return without ever

21:47.243 --> 21:48.592
realizing it.

21:48.594 --> 21:50.177
What, so, you think
there's no way

21:50.179 --> 21:51.512
of covering everything up
this time?

21:51.514 --> 21:54.414
I want to stay and fight,
I do, but...

21:54.416 --> 21:55.966
I don't know.

21:55.968 --> 21:57.768
All of the evidence
is eventually going

21:57.770 --> 21:59.253
to lead them right here,

21:59.255 --> 22:01.255
and your DNA is on everything.

22:01.257 --> 22:03.441
Okay, wait-- what if

22:03.443 --> 22:05.693
the only way
for all of us to be free

22:05.695 --> 22:07.278
is to give them what they want?

22:07.280 --> 22:10.131
And what's that?

22:10.133 --> 22:13.234
Me.

22:18.099 --> 22:20.567
Nearly the same height,
same weight.

22:20.569 --> 22:22.519
He doesn't look anything
like Vincent.

22:22.521 --> 22:24.721
Sorry, the selection of cadavers
at the research lab

22:24.723 --> 22:26.055
wasn't up
to your standards.

22:26.057 --> 22:28.024
Okay, how long has
this guy been dead?

22:28.026 --> 22:30.694
Judging from the smell,
I'd say a month.

22:31.562 --> 22:33.446
One problem.

22:33.448 --> 22:35.749
When Evan does
his autopsy,

22:35.751 --> 22:38.067
he's going to know that
this body didn't die in a fire.

22:38.069 --> 22:40.587
I'm gonna switch the samples in
the lab after the examination.

22:40.589 --> 22:42.672
I'm doing a lot
of things I shouldn't be.

22:42.674 --> 22:45.041
- I'm breaking a lot of laws.
- What other options do we have?

22:45.043 --> 22:47.544
Aside from magically producing
our medieval killer--

22:47.546 --> 22:49.596
which only solves half
the problem anyway--

22:49.598 --> 22:52.549
this is the only way to get
everyone off Vincent's trail.

22:52.551 --> 22:55.435
Make me disappear.

22:55.437 --> 22:58.087
To the rest of the world anyway.
Dead, gone.

22:58.089 --> 23:00.757
Okay, no one gets hurt?
No. We'll start the fire in here,

23:00.759 --> 23:02.475
it'll spread quickly, then,
with all the equipment...

23:02.477 --> 23:04.978
And all the other chemicals
I have...

23:04.980 --> 23:06.646
This place will be
burnt to a crisp

23:06.648 --> 23:07.930
before anyone even arrives.

23:07.932 --> 23:10.533
I can even track
your beast-hunting A Team

23:10.535 --> 23:12.953
so that when we set the blaze,
they're far enough away.

23:12.955 --> 23:15.772
Then if we time the tip-off call
right, the only person left

23:15.774 --> 23:17.991
in this place,
when it's burnt down, will be

23:17.993 --> 23:20.660
dead for a month.

23:20.662 --> 23:22.245
Okay, we just need
to figure out

23:22.247 --> 23:24.748
how much Evan really knows
about my connection to Vincent.

23:24.750 --> 23:26.132
See who else
he's told.

23:26.134 --> 23:28.951
I get it.
I'm the only one he trusts.

23:28.953 --> 23:31.171
Okay, I'm off.

23:31.173 --> 23:33.056
Okay, if something
goes wrong.

23:33.058 --> 23:35.458
We'll meet up
at the safe haven.

23:35.460 --> 23:37.460
Just don't get the task force
here too early.

23:37.462 --> 23:39.646
We want everything good
and charred.

23:39.648 --> 23:40.630
Okay?

23:40.632 --> 23:41.982
Okay.

23:47.905 --> 23:50.523
Yeah, I told the cops
everything I saw.

23:50.525 --> 23:52.025
All right, well, tell me again.

23:52.027 --> 23:53.810
You were behind the counter,
guy's got a gun on you.

23:53.812 --> 23:55.111
Yeah.
Then, all of a sudden,

23:55.113 --> 23:56.746
he's knocked
into the soda fridge.

23:56.748 --> 23:58.581
Yeah, that guy
saved my life,

23:58.583 --> 23:59.949
your vigilante.

23:59.951 --> 24:01.167
Did you get a good look at him?

24:01.169 --> 24:03.152
Like, more than
the picture shows?

24:03.154 --> 24:06.923
Not really, but you know,
now that I think of it...

24:06.925 --> 24:07.679
Yeah?

24:07.704 --> 24:09.660
I don't know, there was
something weird about his face.

24:09.661 --> 24:11.344
It was, uh, full of veins.

24:11.346 --> 24:14.831
That's normal. You said he was angry.
No.

24:14.833 --> 24:16.449
But his face was covered
with veins.

24:16.451 --> 24:18.902
Like-- I don't know--
like an animal maybe.

24:25.726 --> 24:28.278
Based on several interviews,
I'm seeing a pattern emerge.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.863
What do you got?

24:29.865 --> 24:32.515
Listen, you may not
want to hear this,

24:32.517 --> 24:34.851
but you did order me
to conduct these interviews.

24:34.853 --> 24:36.069
Tell me.

24:36.071 --> 24:38.521
Cat might not be so off track
after all.

24:38.523 --> 24:40.206
The vigilante might not be

24:40.208 --> 24:43.192
the coldblooded killer
we think he is.

24:43.194 --> 24:46.296
Except he murdered my brother.

24:46.298 --> 24:47.747
Yes, of course.

24:47.749 --> 24:49.165
Darius being the exception.

24:49.167 --> 24:50.917
Damn big exception.

24:50.919 --> 24:53.303
Also, um...

24:53.305 --> 24:55.672
people are saying--

24:55.674 --> 24:58.892
and I know
what this is gonna sound like--

24:58.894 --> 25:01.594
but that he might not be human.

25:01.596 --> 25:04.013
I'm sorr... Say that again.

25:04.015 --> 25:05.482
Next, you're gonna tell me

25:05.484 --> 25:06.850
that-that-that he rides around
in a UFO?

25:06.852 --> 25:09.069
Does he talk to Martians, too?

25:09.071 --> 25:10.770
I'm trying to catch this guy,

25:10.772 --> 25:13.389
not trying to turn him
into some damn folk hero.

25:13.391 --> 25:15.692
Are you gonna listen to me,
or are you gonna brush me off

25:15.694 --> 25:16.840
like you did by giving me
this bum assignment?

25:16.841 --> 25:18.403
Yeah, well, maybe if you
took it seriously, now...

25:18.428 --> 25:19.897
I am taking it seriously!

25:19.898 --> 25:21.414
I have several
eyewitness reports

25:21.416 --> 25:24.901
that this vigilante had
animalistic qualities.

25:24.903 --> 25:26.453
Not in personality,
in appearance.

25:26.455 --> 25:28.571
Okay, we're done here, Vargas.

25:28.573 --> 25:31.758
Why the hell are you keeping me
out of the loop on this one?

25:34.211 --> 25:36.930
Because I need
to keep you safe, okay?

25:38.215 --> 25:40.717
Look, I already lost
my baby brother.

25:40.719 --> 25:42.268
I won't lose you, too.

25:44.772 --> 25:47.891
I've worked my whole career
to not be protected by the boys,

25:47.893 --> 25:50.026
and I won't allow you
to treat me

25:50.028 --> 25:51.628
any differently.

25:51.630 --> 25:52.829
That's not your call.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.750
I can't do it.

25:57.752 --> 26:00.854
I honestly couldn't take it.

26:00.856 --> 26:03.206
Look, you work for me;
you're staying on the sidelines

26:03.208 --> 26:04.874
on this one.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.499
Gabe Lowan.

26:12.501 --> 26:14.417
Mr. Lowan,
it's Catherine Chandler.

26:14.419 --> 26:16.136
What can I do for you,
Detective?

26:16.138 --> 26:18.555
I have a possible location
for our killer.

26:18.557 --> 26:19.706
You do?

26:19.708 --> 26:21.808
You said,
"by any means necessary,"

26:21.810 --> 26:23.125
so, I went outside the box.

26:23.127 --> 26:24.627
Went to Rikers,

26:24.629 --> 26:26.629
tough-talked a few
of my old collars

26:26.631 --> 26:28.965
who used to be my eyes
and ears on the street.

26:28.967 --> 26:31.133
Turns out,
one of them had an address,

26:31.135 --> 26:32.986
so I'm texting it
to you right now.

26:36.691 --> 26:37.991
Got it.

26:37.993 --> 26:39.976
Great work, Chandler.

26:39.978 --> 26:41.778
Thank you, sir.

26:46.700 --> 26:49.536
- Bait taken.
- Okay.

26:49.538 --> 26:50.854
Let's get ready.

26:54.157 --> 26:56.993
Gentlemen, this is the true
definition of enterprise.

26:56.995 --> 26:58.094
What are we looking at?

26:58.096 --> 26:59.963
Detective Chandler

26:59.965 --> 27:01.681
took some initiative,
knocked some heads,

27:01.683 --> 27:05.218
and came up with a possible
location on our killer.

27:07.137 --> 27:09.472
That's the old chemical plant,
down by the waterfront.

27:09.474 --> 27:12.108
Let's check it out.

27:13.510 --> 27:15.061
Catherine sent these?

27:15.063 --> 27:18.615
Is there a problem, Dr. Marks?

27:18.617 --> 27:21.901
Nope. Good on her.

27:48.967 --> 27:50.369
Lola, you told police

27:50.370 --> 27:52.128
that the man who
tried to attack you--

27:52.129 --> 27:53.846
he was stopped
by the vigilante.

27:53.848 --> 27:55.881
If he hadn't been there,
I might have been killed.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.900
Newspapers quoted you
as saying

27:57.902 --> 27:59.802
the vigilante had
cat-like reflexes.

27:59.804 --> 28:03.188
He moved like a cat, but not
a, you know, domesticated cat.

28:03.190 --> 28:06.258
Something more wild,
like a jaguar.

28:06.260 --> 28:09.228
You hear him speak?

28:09.230 --> 28:10.813
I heard him growl.

28:10.815 --> 28:12.264
And when he...

28:12.266 --> 28:14.783
killed my attacker,
it was like animal shrieks

28:14.785 --> 28:16.569
mixed with my
attacker's screams.

28:16.571 --> 28:18.237
You see his face?

28:18.239 --> 28:20.039
No. Not clearly.

28:20.041 --> 28:23.125
But, um-- and this is
something I didn't tell anyone,

28:23.127 --> 28:25.828
I only remembered
after the fact--

28:25.830 --> 28:29.248
the man
who saved me had yellow eyes.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.849
Yellow eyes?

28:30.851 --> 28:32.551
Like a cat's, actually.

28:32.553 --> 28:34.169
If a cat's eyes glowed.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.205
And you said everything
happened here?

28:36.207 --> 28:38.857
Right after I got off work.

28:38.859 --> 28:41.176
The guy who saved me was just...

28:41.178 --> 28:42.478
he disappeared.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.713
He was here one minute,
then he was gone.

28:47.817 --> 28:50.836
Listen, I... I got
to get back to work.

28:50.838 --> 28:53.355
Of course.
Thanks for your time.

29:19.466 --> 29:22.551
Okay, they're still
at the precinct.

29:23.603 --> 29:26.555
Hey. Don't worry.

29:26.557 --> 29:30.025
If it means that we get
to spend more time together,

29:30.027 --> 29:32.528
and no one else gets hurt
anymore, then...

29:32.530 --> 29:34.813
it's worth it, yeah?

29:34.815 --> 29:36.281
Yeah.

29:36.283 --> 29:40.369
Maybe this is a chance
for you to start over.

29:40.371 --> 29:42.621
And for us.

29:42.623 --> 29:45.240
Exactly. It's a good thing.

29:45.242 --> 29:48.410
Although, I am really
gonna miss this old place.

29:48.412 --> 29:49.995
Yeah, there's that.

29:54.384 --> 29:56.552
Where are you gonna go?

29:56.554 --> 29:58.537
Uh...

29:58.539 --> 30:01.340
I don't know;
we'll find someplace.

30:01.342 --> 30:04.343
We'll just have to be
more careful this time.

30:04.345 --> 30:08.313
Not with everything, hopefully.

30:09.265 --> 30:12.518
Where did I find you?

30:19.492 --> 30:22.861
Enjoy it while you can.

30:22.863 --> 30:27.249
You haven't even gotten
to my difficult side yet.

30:38.178 --> 30:39.928
Did you call to lounge
around an empty yard?

30:39.930 --> 30:41.463
Because as much as I
enjoy this weather...

30:41.465 --> 30:43.215
I wanted to tell you
I'm giving up

30:43.217 --> 30:45.917
on my cross-species
DNA research.

30:45.919 --> 30:48.420
Doesn't sound like the dogged
JT Forbes that I worked with.

30:48.422 --> 30:50.889
I'm under a lot of pressure
at the university to publish

30:50.891 --> 30:53.525
something that doesn't smell of
"extraterrestrial life-forms."

30:53.527 --> 30:55.527
I'm sorry to hear that.

30:55.529 --> 30:58.930
So I wanted to offer you
my research.

30:58.932 --> 31:00.816
I mean, if you're
still working on that.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.868
Afraid I'm out of
the game as well.

31:02.870 --> 31:04.102
You are?

31:04.104 --> 31:06.205
And I tell you this
in confidence:

31:06.207 --> 31:07.906
I don't think our,
uh, creature

31:07.908 --> 31:09.491
is long for this world.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.960
He's been caught?
Not yet. But there's a task force

31:11.962 --> 31:14.112
within our department--
they're closing in on him.

31:14.114 --> 31:16.339
They're gonna raid the
location within the hour.

31:16.364 --> 31:17.133
Wow.

31:17.134 --> 31:19.501
But I couldn't
leave room for error.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.220
That sounds ominous.

31:21.222 --> 31:23.088
What do you mean?

31:23.090 --> 31:25.174
Seriously, what did you do?

31:25.176 --> 31:26.958
I got in contact
with some people

31:26.960 --> 31:29.812
who will destroy this
thing once and for all.

31:29.814 --> 31:32.130
Wait, the only people
that could...

31:34.517 --> 31:37.186
Muirfield?

31:37.188 --> 31:40.322
Did you... How'd you even
get in touch with them?

31:40.324 --> 31:42.191
Look, JT, I'm gonna
have to go back to work

31:42.193 --> 31:43.659
before they realize I'm missing.
You gave Muirfield

31:43.661 --> 31:45.861
the address so they can
get there before the cops?

31:45.863 --> 31:48.247
Catherine will finally be safe.

31:48.249 --> 31:50.449
Some things are more
important than research.

31:50.451 --> 31:52.818
Well, I guess
you don't need mine,

31:52.820 --> 31:55.204
since you have
the real thing to study.

31:55.206 --> 31:57.756
Good luck.
Let me know how it goes.

32:04.013 --> 32:06.014
Hopefully, by the time
this task force arrives,

32:06.016 --> 32:07.516
this place will
be long gone.

32:07.518 --> 32:09.218
On the front page
of every newspaper,

32:09.220 --> 32:10.519
it'll say that that vigilante

32:10.521 --> 32:13.505
serial killer
from the park's dead.

32:15.442 --> 32:16.975
What is it?

32:24.067 --> 32:25.317
It's Muirfield.

32:25.319 --> 32:26.819
How'd they find you?
I don't know.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.535
Come on.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.728
Hold for my go!

32:55.214 --> 32:57.716
Go. Go.

33:04.557 --> 33:06.224
Come on. Down.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.410
You okay?

34:05.411 --> 34:07.928
Yeah, it's over.

34:07.930 --> 34:10.264
Whoever saw us
back there, they're...

34:10.266 --> 34:12.416
they're gone.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.134
My biggest problem now
will be trying not

34:14.136 --> 34:16.603
to let my mind wander to us
when I'm at work.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.089
We have to promise

34:19.091 --> 34:21.058
to not get caught up
in this haze again.

34:21.943 --> 34:24.194
We got so lost in each other,

34:24.196 --> 34:26.813
we... we pretended that
the outside world didn't exist.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.983
Right.

34:28.985 --> 34:31.185
I promise.

34:32.737 --> 34:36.440
But, Vincent,
just like that, we, uh...

34:36.442 --> 34:39.109
we have a fresh start.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.945
Yeah.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.797
Us against the world, huh?

34:43.799 --> 34:46.283
Well, us and... JT

34:46.284 --> 34:48.284
against the world.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.954
You know, there's
still someone out there

34:50.956 --> 34:52.889
that's trying to set me up.

34:52.891 --> 34:55.559
Whoever killed
that carriage driver

34:55.561 --> 34:56.893
did it for a reason.

34:56.896 --> 34:59.096
We'll find out who or, um...

34:59.098 --> 35:01.065
or what he is.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.468
I'll catch up
with you guys later.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.854
I've got to show my face
at the warehouse,

35:06.856 --> 35:08.305
make sure no one
gets suspicious.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.741
Yeah.

35:10.743 --> 35:13.410
Stay down here, until I
make sure everything's clear.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.329
I won't be long.

35:15.331 --> 35:16.864
