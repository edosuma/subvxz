00:17.850 --> 00:20.687
You know, My-- Mylene, um...

00:23.190 --> 00:24.565
I, um...

00:24.649 --> 00:26.984
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.111
I got nothing, I got nothing.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.864
I don't got nothing.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.076
You got nothing?

00:36.911 --> 00:40.624
I gave you $40,000
and you got fucking nothing?

00:40.707 --> 00:42.960
<i>Pedro, ¿cómo está? ¿Está bien?</i>

00:43.042 --> 00:45.212
It's so good to see you at church
on Sunday morning.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.171
<i>- Hola.</i>
- How are you?

00:49.924 --> 00:51.093
Mylene?

00:57.140 --> 01:01.270
Do mustard and onions
mean anything to you?

01:04.730 --> 01:09.319
I said, do mustard
and onions mean anything to you?

01:09.903 --> 01:11.112
Get up.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.865
I like it on my hotdog, DJ Kool Herc, sir.

01:14.950 --> 01:18.203
Ma, can you get the little man
one with mustard and onions?

01:18.287 --> 01:20.162
-Sure thing.
-No sauerkraut?

01:20.246 --> 01:21.539
No. No sauerkraut.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.085
My man. Now, see,
this is a family affair. Right, Dad?

01:25.168 --> 01:29.171
Ever since we hooked up my sound system
and co-DJ'ed your first party.

01:29.256 --> 01:32.591
And we started these parties
to have a place to play music

01:32.676 --> 01:36.054
and have fun and stay out of all that
static out there in the street.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.390
Now you wanna bring the street
into this castle I built?

01:38.472 --> 01:40.016
I'm sorry, but he-- It was--

01:40.099 --> 01:42.311
I prefer eating vegetarian food.

01:43.311 --> 01:47.064
But if you must eat meat,
make sure them kosher.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.817
-You hear me, now?
-Yeah.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.652
That's all beef, right there.

01:52.486 --> 01:53.864
Now give me this.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.490
Tell me, Pedro, how'd you
get involved in all this, man?

01:56.575 --> 01:58.784
They were trying to bootleg a show.
I was telling them to stop.

01:58.868 --> 02:02.456
-What? Hey, no, this dude. This dude.
-Hey, Shao, Shao, Shao.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.956
-That's the King of Cassettes.
-Shao.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.459
Cool it, man, cool it.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.335
Now you accusing Pedro of being
the King of Cassettes?

02:07.418 --> 02:08.627
Hell, yeah.

02:08.752 --> 02:09.586
How dare you.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.299
Pedro's our brother.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.009
Now, y'all disrespecting my family.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.512
Pedro's our top sound guy,
he wouldn't do nothing like that.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.181
-Then what's this?
-It's gotta be one of their bootlegs.

02:20.264 --> 02:23.685
Yo, Herc.
This is that kook from around Flash's way.

02:23.769 --> 02:27.438
They the ones using them bootleg Flash
tapes, faking like they DJs and whatnot.

02:27.521 --> 02:28.856
How long we known each other?

02:29.441 --> 02:32.235
You think I'll do you like that?
They phonies.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.153
- We ain't no phonies.
- You ain't telling the truth.

02:34.236 --> 02:35.112
That's a lie.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.531
-We ain't no phonies.
-How do you explain this shit here?

02:39.158 --> 02:40.743
What's that?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.788
- Man.
- What the fuck is this?

02:43.872 --> 02:46.165
Customized to hook
straight into your system.

02:46.248 --> 02:49.668
Herc. They been bootlegging you,
so they can fake like they you.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.671
-I've been trying to stop them.
-Except this stuff doesn't belong to us.

02:54.883 --> 02:58.094
It's nice to see you again,
Jackie Moreno.

02:58.719 --> 03:00.514
I remember you from that day.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.518
The day of Mylene's... miracle.

03:05.644 --> 03:08.271
I don't suppose you had anything to do
with that dress she was wearing.

03:09.855 --> 03:11.149
Or was it you, Francisco?

03:12.359 --> 03:13.526
Or maybe you and my wife?

03:13.610 --> 03:16.612
- Lydia had nothing to do with this.
- Nothing to do with it, but you did.

03:16.695 --> 03:18.907
-It was my choice.
<i>-Cállate la boca.</i>

03:18.990 --> 03:21.700
-Ramon.
-No, the Lord has laws.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.996
He decrees
that you shall not raise your voice

03:25.079 --> 03:27.581
but in praise of him.
<i>¿Entiendes?</i>

03:29.459 --> 03:30.544
And you, <i>mi hermano</i>.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.337
You don't have a family of your own,
so you interfere with mine.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.929
- You know, if I wasn't a man of God--
- Man of God.

03:41.430 --> 03:44.598
You forget that you became a man of God
in prison, right, bro?

03:44.682 --> 03:46.475
-Cisco?
-What did Fuerte just say?

03:46.560 --> 03:49.187
He said shit is about to get real.

03:49.271 --> 03:52.566
Come preach here all you want,
but to me you're still gonna be

03:52.649 --> 03:55.444
that little <i>pendejo</i>
that got two girls pregnant back in PR.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.444
- Is that true?
<i>- Diablo.</i>

03:56.527 --> 03:58.487
-<i>Diab--</i> No, that's you.
-Cisco, don't.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.157
You ever wonder what happened
to those kids you abandoned

04:01.241 --> 04:04.745
to come over here and party in the land
of milk and honey and <i>cocaína?</i>

04:04.828 --> 04:06.121
- Silence.
- Then when you get here,

04:06.204 --> 04:08.664
you almost kill a man and his kid
with your car.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.584
But you forgot that, right?
You blacked out.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.002
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.879
Who are you to judge anyone?

04:14.962 --> 04:16.173
That was in the past.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.884
But, <i>papi, ¿es la verdad?</i>

04:18.966 --> 04:20.552
I'm sorry, Mylene.

04:20.634 --> 04:21.927
We all have sins.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.432
-That's me, too.
-All of us are searching for forgiveness.

04:25.514 --> 04:28.435
Amen! Hallelujah,
I'm a sinner too, pastor.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.353
I'm in search of forgiveness.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.605
I battle my demons daily.
I don't go to church.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.483
-Shut the fuck up, Jackie.
-But listen, listen.

04:34.566 --> 04:38.319
It's like, you know, people like me,
we find salvation in songs.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.865
But disco's like a mantra,
it's a prayer, it's a message.

04:41.947 --> 04:45.786
Our discos even have names like
The Sanctuary and The Church.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.329
Your discos are full of drugs
and homosexuality.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.665
<i>Pero</i> we gotta reach the sinners
where they lay, no?

04:50.749 --> 04:52.375
'Cause, like we were reached.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.877
No. There's no place
for the word of God in your disco.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.298
No. Hey, the people in the discos,
they want-- they wanna feel raised up,

04:58.380 --> 04:59.716
they want God, they want the light,

04:59.800 --> 05:01.425
that's what we've been working on
night and day.

05:01.884 --> 05:05.346
Like a song about forgiveness
and resurrection.

05:05.430 --> 05:10.810
A Latino, Pentecostal, communal
Puerto Rican disco hymn record, right?

05:10.894 --> 05:12.771
-Right, Mylene?
-Right.

05:12.853 --> 05:16.399
Because Mylene Cruz
is gonna be the world's first

05:16.483 --> 05:18.526
<i>boricua</i> Pentecostal disco star.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.446
You know that beautiful hymn,
"Set Me Free"?

05:21.947 --> 05:24.490
Does it not say that a man
who says he's in the light

05:24.574 --> 05:28.077
and hates his brother
is still in darkness?

It's about unity and respect.

05:54.019 --> 05:57.314
But if you disrespect me,
we gonna air it out.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.733
Out in the street.
Get 'em outta here.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.571
- Yo, come on, look. Cool Herc!
- Hold up, hold up.

06:02.653 --> 06:05.531
You trying to do something positive here,
right, man? Right?

06:05.615 --> 06:06.949
Let him through.

06:07.033 --> 06:07.867
We about that.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.536
Peace, unity.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.290
So, I'm gonna tell y'all the truth
about my crew and me.

06:14.040 --> 06:14.958
We made a mistake.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.668
But let me get a fly drum break.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.302
And I'll prove to all y'all
the Get Down Brothers are far from fake.

So what we've done, we've taken a hymn...

06:39.231 --> 06:41.108
we've added a little disco beat...

06:46.572 --> 06:48.449
And a little Latin funk, right, Luis?

06:48.533 --> 06:50.576
One, two, three, four.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.379
And what we're gonna do, pastor,
with your permission,

07:02.463 --> 07:04.673
is record in your church.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.843
Because that church
has an acoustical quality

07:07.927 --> 07:11.805
that Jesús himself
must have sent as a blessing!

07:16.060 --> 07:18.812
We could use the church choir, too.

07:23.108 --> 07:26.153

11:13.923 --> 11:15.884
<i>Instead of riding around in a fly OJ</i>

11:15.966 --> 11:18.385
<i>You got one shot, get it on the humble</i>

11:18.469 --> 11:21.514
<i>Make your battle a DJ rumble</i>

11:24.350 --> 11:25.809
Yo, what's a DJ rumble?

11:25.894 --> 11:28.062
Be cool, y'all.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.359
In two weeks' time, your two
crews will battle with your systems,

11:33.442 --> 11:35.153
your records, and your rhymes.

11:35.528 --> 11:39.823
Whichever army gets the B-boys to rock
is the army that comes out on top.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.869
-Right, Ma?
-Right, child.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.995
Now, ladies...

11:45.078 --> 11:47.789
...don't Herc nobody.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.960
Rock on.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.451
Y'all must think y'all Charles Bronson
in <i>Death Wish</i> coming back over here.

12:24.534 --> 12:27.245
We got something for Flash
that y'all dummies couldn't get.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.289
Hey.

12:29.916 --> 12:30.750
Let him in.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.384
It belonged to the King of Cassettes.

12:39.466 --> 12:41.259
We tracked him down
and took it off him.

12:42.177 --> 12:43.011
Osu.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.057
And we got the tape back,
the final bootleg tape.

12:46.139 --> 12:49.143
It's my honor to present them both to you,
Grandmaster.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.770
Here.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.192
Everybody leave.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.653
You deaf? Go on, go.

13:01.154 --> 13:02.865
Hey. You stay.

13:03.615 --> 13:04.450
Sit down.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.673
What's your purpose here? For real.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.634
I wanted to show you how serious
we took that bootlegging shit.

13:21.717 --> 13:22.677
No, forget tapes.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.471
And I wanted to make things right.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.433
And you got a battle coming up, right?

13:30.225 --> 13:32.729
-So you heard about that.
-Come on, I hear about everything.

13:33.937 --> 13:37.107
So, I was gonna ask you if we can battle.

13:38.692 --> 13:39.943
Notorious Three.

13:40.736 --> 13:41.988
Well, them Herc boys,

13:42.113 --> 13:44.197
they got fans, they got experience,

13:44.282 --> 13:46.783
they got speakers so fucking loud
they crack concrete.

13:46.868 --> 13:47.701
What you got?

13:50.913 --> 13:54.042
-I'm gonna find something.
-No, but you already did.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.711
Universal DJ rule 17, Grasshopper.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.713
In order to fly,
a DJ must trust his wings.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.090
And you better.

14:01.173 --> 14:05.510
'Cause you lose, you lost for both of us,
and the ban is reinstated.

14:06.553 --> 14:09.139
-You're like a mentor to me. And--
-Forget me.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.225
What is your purpose, Grasshopper?

14:13.561 --> 14:15.855
-I just like to spin records, man.
-Okay, but why?

14:20.109 --> 14:22.903
When I'm spinning records,
everything else just falls out.

14:22.986 --> 14:24.197
It's about music, man.

14:24.279 --> 14:26.740
-I know.
-No, you don't know.

14:28.158 --> 14:31.245
Music is the only reason.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.499
It'll... it'll move you forward
and open up doors

14:34.581 --> 14:36.500
that everyone says are shut, Shao.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.087
It'll give you the whole fucking world
for free if you just love it

14:40.171 --> 14:41.713
and hold back nothing.

14:42.506 --> 14:45.884
If the shit really is your life,
if the shit really does have your heart...

14:45.967 --> 14:46.969
-It does.
-...then where were you

14:47.052 --> 14:48.678
when your wings found that tape?

14:50.472 --> 14:53.142
You the DJ, ain't you?
That's your crew, right?

14:53.768 --> 14:55.769
You supposed to lead.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.649
Conduct, control the crowd,
move the crowd.

14:59.981 --> 15:02.150
Know time. Administer joy.

15:02.235 --> 15:05.238
I don't know what else you caught up in
and I do not need to know,

15:05.321 --> 15:09.075
but I know there's no faking
that hell-born fire.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.494
That shit beats your heart for you.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.328
Boom-boom.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.038
Boom-boom.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.916
Boom-boom. You hear it?

15:17.875 --> 15:18.708
You hear it?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.293
-I hear it.
-How it sound?

15:21.754 --> 15:22.629
Sound like victory.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.049
Osu.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.721
And Grasshopper.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.890
If you wanna be a true DJ,
conquer your street.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.600
Conquer your park.

15:35.684 --> 15:39.272
Conquer your neighborhood,
conquer your borough. Conquer your city.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.149
And the world is yours.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.359
So, battle.

15:48.739 --> 15:52.118
Notorious Three, get ready,
we going to battle, baby. Whoo!

15:52.201 --> 15:54.202
-Yeah?
-But once we find our new dojo,

15:54.287 --> 15:56.538
-we gonna be dropping bombs.
-Where we gonna practice?

15:56.621 --> 15:58.749
-I know a secret spot.
-Secret?

15:59.959 --> 16:00.918
A mansion.

Mr. Gunns is in committee meetings

18:29.650 --> 18:30.942
So, I'm sorry,

18:31.027 --> 18:33.445

18:48.419 --> 18:50.921
So, you were late
because you were out late at a party.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.423
I said I was sorry.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.800
I don't think he knows
how silly he sounds.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.427
At a party?

18:58.596 --> 18:59.471
Nursery rhyming?

18:59.555 --> 19:00.972
It's not nursery rhyming.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.516
What is it, then?

19:03.351 --> 19:05.060
-You wouldn't understand.
-Try me.

19:06.436 --> 19:07.270
Go on.

19:10.482 --> 19:14.944
It's like, when I get up on stage
and say what I gotta say, I know who I am,

19:15.028 --> 19:17.865
and right now y'all are pushing me
to be who you want me to be

19:17.948 --> 19:19.407
and nobody's asking what I wanna be.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.493
I mean,
who says I even wanna go to college?

19:22.452 --> 19:24.329
Hold up.

19:24.913 --> 19:28.541
Was it you who told Papa Fuerte
you wanted the internship?

19:30.169 --> 19:32.546
-Yeah.
-And was it you who said

19:32.630 --> 19:34.923
you were gonna be on time
for this internship?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.343
-Yeah.
-But it was also you

19:37.425 --> 19:39.427
who, on your own,
showed up late.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.097
-Yeah. But it--
-So, fucking decide, Ezekiel.

19:42.597 --> 19:45.226
It's up to you
but make the choice.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.311
Most of the kids in your class,
and you know this,

19:48.395 --> 19:50.146
live with a slave mentality.

19:50.690 --> 19:54.442
You know what I'm talking about.
The idea that if you smart and educated

19:54.527 --> 19:58.698
that somehow you ain't down or cool,
or God forbid, you ain't even black.

19:58.780 --> 20:02.410
But if you remain ignorant
and running the streets, then you real.

20:03.201 --> 20:07.330
It's the same reason you didn't get
in front of the class and read your essay.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.959
Because you are afraid of being smart.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.920
You are afraid of
your own God-given gift.

20:13.002 --> 20:15.005
-Says you.
-Yeah, I say.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.214
You gotta decide whether

20:16.298 --> 20:19.259
you wanna be more than just
some field nigga running the streets.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.096
You gotta decide
who you wanna be, Ezekiel.

20:23.096 --> 20:26.642
Sister, I'm sorry if
I overstepped my boundaries here.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.353
<i>Por favor, hermana.</i>
Right on, power to the people.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.189
You drinking that Mad Dog 20/20, boy.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.317
And, um...

20:36.861 --> 20:38.612
I never met your mother...

20:40.280 --> 20:41.615
but I can be damn sure

20:41.699 --> 20:45.827
that the future she dreamed for you
did not look like this.

20:46.619 --> 20:48.788
-Leon.
-No, no, ain't nothing wrong with me now.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.250
Just circumstances
and principalities, you dig?

20:51.709 --> 20:53.544
But my mama didn't teach me no piano.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.046
Never made me read no book a week.

20:57.088 --> 20:58.548
And as it happens...

21:00.009 --> 21:02.553
no one ever offered me no opportunities...

21:04.180 --> 21:05.972
like they offering you.

21:07.141 --> 21:07.974
See now...

21:08.976 --> 21:09.977
right now...

21:11.770 --> 21:13.021
you got a comfort zone.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.148
But your mama...

21:16.400 --> 21:17.984
wasn't preparing you for comfort.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.280
She was preparing you to be a man.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.534
To blaze your own path...

21:27.827 --> 21:29.622
without anybody with you.

21:39.088 --> 21:40.465
Where are you going?

21:45.179 --> 21:48.015
"Grand Imperial Force MCs."

21:48.097 --> 21:50.392
"Hypnotizing Five."

21:50.476 --> 21:52.353
"Fearless Four."

21:52.435 --> 21:54.020
"Invincible Three."

21:54.104 --> 21:56.856
-You know anything about this?
-No, ma'am.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.567
All of a sudden,
niggas out here calling themselves

21:58.651 --> 22:02.028
"Bionic Space Cowboys" and shit.
You know we got robbed?

22:02.695 --> 22:05.532
-A thousand dollar sound system.
-Yo, that's fucked up.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.076
My son seems to think
you had something to do with it.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.744
I don't know nothing about that.

22:09.828 --> 22:10.703
Good.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.414
Any word on our little friend Napoleon?

22:13.499 --> 22:16.125
Yeah, he's still hiding out
in Poughkeepsie. I got my people on it.

22:16.376 --> 22:19.963
Maybe I should send Shaolin up to get him.

22:20.047 --> 22:23.259
Shit. You see or hear shit,
you let us know.

22:24.093 --> 22:24.926
Dig?

22:26.679 --> 22:27.805
Dig.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.979
I would like to see Mr. Gunns, please.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.064
I'm sorry, Mr--?

22:37.272 --> 22:38.190

24:22.336 --> 24:24.380
-Good night, Janet.
-Good evening, Mr. G--

24:29.550 --> 24:31.970
I had this nightmare,
and now I'm bugging out, Ra.

24:32.054 --> 24:35.973
Notorious Three got Herc's Echoplex
and Bertha speakers.

24:36.599 --> 24:40.395
And them Herculoids is like Hulk, Gigantor
and every other freak of nature

24:40.479 --> 24:43.481
that you don't want messing with you
all rolled up in one.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.192
What did you say?

24:45.275 --> 24:47.736
I said we need some sort of
secret weapon I ain't thought of yet.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.947
For the battle, I ain't scared of nothing.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.574
But them Berthas scare the shit out of me.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.951
I thought that's what you said.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.329
My friend...

24:59.205 --> 25:00.039
Fear.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.711
It is a rational
evolutionary response to danger.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.171
But it's also clear to me...

25:07.338 --> 25:08.548
through extensive reading...

25:09.383 --> 25:12.219
that the only other rational
evolutionary response to danger...

25:13.220 --> 25:14.304
is superpowers.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.642
Your rational response is
"get some superpowers"?

25:18.976 --> 25:20.602
But superpowers alone ain't enough.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.272
Some dangers are just too great
to fight alone.

25:24.772 --> 25:29.193
So, that's when you gotta combine
your superpowers into one big one.

25:31.070 --> 25:32.780
What the fuck are you talking about, Ra?

25:32.865 --> 25:36.326
-Look, I'm talking about superheroes...
-No, no.

25:36.993 --> 25:39.037
...superheroes with the unity of purpose.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.957
There's no X-Man in <i>X-Men.</i>

25:42.332 --> 25:46.211
Acting alone, neither Wolverine
nor Cyclops could defeat the Herculoids.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.380
But acting together,

25:48.463 --> 25:51.133
if every man in
the Get Down Brothers rhymes,

25:51.215 --> 25:53.259
-with our rhymes combined--
-You can't rhyme.

25:54.260 --> 25:55.179
I can.

25:55.887 --> 25:56.846
If Zeke writes them.

25:58.222 --> 25:59.892
Zeke's gonna write rhymes for all of us.

26:01.309 --> 26:04.229
Ra, a DJ battle's about records,
not words.

26:04.438 --> 26:05.521
Plus Zeke's busy.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.191
No, he could do it.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.777
If he could fit us into his schedule.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.153
Mr. Gunns, I'm Ezekiel Figuero.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.363
You missed your appointment.

26:13.864 --> 26:16.200
-Look, I'm not here to kiss your ass.
-Excuse me?

26:16.282 --> 26:19.787
Or apologize for missing my appointment.
That was a stupid mistake.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.163
Fatal, in fact.

26:22.163 --> 26:25.041
But I gave some thought
to what you'd get out of this internship.

26:26.542 --> 26:29.587
A minority ghetto mascot who looks good
for community relations, right?

26:30.631 --> 26:32.673
What exactly are you implying, son?

26:33.925 --> 26:36.761
Balzac said, "Behind every great fortune
there's a crime."

26:36.845 --> 26:40.432
And I know upstanding families
like the Kennedys and the Rockefellers

26:40.516 --> 26:43.059
didn't make their names
without the right alliances.

26:43.143 --> 26:46.521
So, I offer you the chance
to ally with me.

26:46.980 --> 26:50.275
I'm smart, and I'm ambitious,
and I will be successful.

26:50.817 --> 26:53.528
I want to be a leader for my community
like Mr. Cruz and you.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.949
So, I'm giving you,
smart businessman that you are,

26:57.031 --> 27:00.285
an opportunity
to get in on the ground floor.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.748
You're Mr. Cruz's choice?

27:05.874 --> 27:07.084
That's right, Papa Fuerte.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.421
Why don't you come
to dinner Saturday night?

27:12.381 --> 27:13.632
Ask Janet to schedule it.

27:13.757 --> 27:16.343
But remember, leaders lead,
so don't be late.

27:18.386 --> 27:20.763
At least if you
get kicked out of your house again,

27:20.847 --> 27:23.182
- you know where to come.
- I'm gonna miss you all.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.852
Girl, I can't believe you're going home.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.144
I'm gonna miss
having you here all the time.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.605
I've been living with
three stupid boys all my life.

27:30.356 --> 27:32.025
It was nice to have a sister for a minute.

27:32.526 --> 27:34.193
I'm gonna miss wearing all your clothes.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.323
We're gonna see each other
all the time, you know.

27:38.781 --> 27:40.075
Now that we're a girl group.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.494
This is real big, right?

27:43.871 --> 27:46.707
Like, our lives maybe
could change and shit.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.625
-I almost don't believe it.
-Why?

27:50.126 --> 27:51.836
We've been singing together all our lives.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.463
Yeah, but that was just for fun.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.342
I just...

28:00.053 --> 28:02.263
never thought this could happen
to someone like me.

28:02.931 --> 28:03.765
Yolanda.

28:04.223 --> 28:07.144
Your voice is on point. You foxy as hell.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.769
And you're the coolest person I know.

28:09.186 --> 28:10.771
Ain't nobody better for this than you.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.526
We're about to get
everything we wanted, girl.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.112
But is this definitely what you want?

28:18.154 --> 28:19.405
Singing the holy music again?

28:20.865 --> 28:24.076
Look, the way I see it,
Jackie's created something new.

28:24.493 --> 28:27.288
You know, a song like ours doesn't exist,
that's gonna count for something.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.333
Yeah, I guess you right.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.667
And my parents are happy.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.795
They're accepting me,
letting me come home.

28:33.878 --> 28:37.507
And I'm happy because I get to sing,
and that's all I wanted.

28:37.590 --> 28:41.345
And I'm happy because
you about to make us all famous.

28:41.427 --> 28:42.386
No.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.431
We're doing that together.

28:46.767 --> 28:49.144
The Notorious Three
are gonna have size and strength.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.104
So, we're gonna need coordination.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.316
Like Flash said, "Being in unison."
No disarray.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.778
So, I said, "Maybe...

28:59.445 --> 29:00.864
you could write rhymes for all of us."

29:00.948 --> 29:04.534
And I said, "It's not a rhyme battle.
It's a DJ battle."

29:05.076 --> 29:07.203
I'm the DJ, meaning I'm in charge.

29:07.621 --> 29:08.829
I'm the conductor.

29:09.413 --> 29:11.791
-I mean, it's just a suggestion.
-I like it.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.585
-Me too.
-Me too.

29:13.669 --> 29:14.961
-Really?
-Yeah.

29:15.045 --> 29:17.673
Shao, you still gonna be the conductor.
We just gonna be your instruments.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.008
You know, like, I'm a tuba,
Boo-Boo's a cymbal,

29:20.092 --> 29:23.553
Ra-Ra's a violin and Dizzee's a triangle.

29:23.636 --> 29:25.180
I'm partial to the piccolo flute.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.309
What you think?

29:30.394 --> 29:32.186
You know, I could write
something for you, you know.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.730
Something special for the conductor.

29:38.902 --> 29:41.822
<i>In order to fly,</i>
<i>a DJ must trust his wings.</i>

29:41.904 --> 29:43.281
-You gotta write fast.
-Yeah.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.241
- All right! Whoo-hoo!
- We only got a week.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.410
And we gotta rehearse.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.997
Can't have the orchestra
fucking up the main event.

29:50.454 --> 29:51.707
- You dig?
- All right.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.583
Then I'll see you
first thing in the morning.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.001
Where you going?

29:55.085 --> 29:56.711
He gonna play piano for his girl.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.423
Don't give me that look.
I blew Mylene off to get that Flash tape.

29:59.506 --> 30:00.715
<i>So, I owe this to her.</i>

30:01.173 --> 30:03.384
I'm gonna have those rhymes though.
I'm gonna have the rhymes.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.345
<i> Yeah, I'm trusting you, Books.</i>

30:05.429 --> 30:06.596
Make 'em good!

30:09.974 --> 30:11.309
<i>A rhyme for Dizzee.</i>

30:12.477 --> 30:13.894
<i>My brother said to me</i>

30:14.354 --> 30:16.565
<i>Go by the name of Pretty Dizzee D</i>

30:17.231 --> 30:19.734

Mr. Moreno here, he brought peace
to our family and reunited us in our home.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.210
Perhaps he should give the blessing?

32:42.294 --> 32:44.045
My wife, as always, is correct.

32:45.337 --> 32:46.673
Mr. Moreno, please.

32:46.756 --> 32:47.965
<i>Oye, pero...</i>

32:48.048 --> 32:48.884
Make it fast.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.802
- Less is more.
- Yeah, sure.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.847
This one is from when
I grew up poor on Arthur Avenue...

32:55.432 --> 32:56.892
the guinea section of the Bronx.

32:57.476 --> 33:02.480
Dear Lord, bless this food
as the porridge thickens.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.566
But give us more, Lord,

33:04.648 --> 33:07.067
because we're skinnier
than them Puerto Ricans.

33:11.655 --> 33:13.991
-To Jackie Moreno.
-To my brother.

33:15.367 --> 33:16.619
For seeing the light.

33:16.702 --> 33:18.497
And to Mylene for coming home.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.582
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

33:21.415 --> 33:24.961
And I would just like to say
to my beautiful daughter...

33:25.921 --> 33:28.006
and to all of you...

33:29.423 --> 33:30.509
we all have flaws...

33:31.593 --> 33:33.220
we all wrestle with demons...

33:35.387 --> 33:38.307
But-- I...

33:39.267 --> 33:40.519
But God...

33:41.519 --> 33:43.188
he loves us anyway.

33:43.563 --> 33:46.732
And he--

33:47.567 --> 33:51.278
And as much as God loves you all,
I love you more.

33:51.695 --> 33:53.198
<i>Mami,</i> you sound drunk.

33:54.406 --> 33:56.785
I think what your mother's
trying to say is that um...

33:57.201 --> 33:58.202
we all fall down.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.413
And we all deserve second chances.

34:02.039 --> 34:06.294
And it's true.
Just ask the piano man right there.?

34:06.711 --> 34:08.755
A chance to be a future leader.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.340
He blew his big shot.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.300
But then he just picked himself right up.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.512
And he said, "I'm not giving up.

34:17.264 --> 34:19.056
Pick me. I'm a leader."

34:20.266 --> 34:21.226
So, here's to him.

34:22.768 --> 34:24.103
Go get that internship.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.369
Yo, Rumi.

34:39.452 --> 34:41.829
-What's up, Crash?
-You just missed that whole car you did.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.456
-Yeah? Was impressive enough?
-Fucking jay right it was.

34:44.541 --> 34:46.418
You seen Thor? We were supposed to
meet here at the bench.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.710
No. I ain't seen him since
you brought him around the other day.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.630
-Man, once a phantom, always a phantom.
-Hell yeah.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.090
If you see him, tell him I was here.

34:53.172 --> 34:54.842
You're never gonna
see that dude again, bro.

34:54.925 --> 34:57.721
Yo, check the tunnel.
I hear he's working on a new piece there.

34:58.054 --> 34:58.972
Later, Rumi.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.518
-Yo, that last burner was amazing.
-Aight.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.335
Fuck you doing, nigga?

35:31.588 --> 35:33.380
Just looking for some records
for my brother.

35:33.797 --> 35:34.673
That so?

35:36.342 --> 35:38.887
These records is pretty obscure.

35:40.262 --> 35:41.389
Know what "obscure" means?

35:42.014 --> 35:44.476
It means "hard to replace"
like any sound system.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.061
You a DJ?

35:47.896 --> 35:50.315

36:02.661 --> 36:04.119

That's why I'm gonna offer you a deal.

36:08.083 --> 36:12.711

36:54.378 --> 36:55.963
Boo, you take that rhyme.

Don't work like that no more, you know?
The radio don't sell disco records.

42:34.885 --> 42:37.637
What makes a hit a hit
is if it proves itself

42:37.722 --> 42:39.389
on the dance floor where the sinners are.

42:40.141 --> 42:42.059
And it ain't gonna be
on the dance floor

42:42.143 --> 42:44.728
unless it gets into the hands
of the top DJs in the city.

42:44.811 --> 42:46.271
Then we gotta do that then, come on.

42:46.355 --> 42:49.233
Mr. Moreno, Little Wolf
knows a gang of DJs.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.068
I doubt he knows the DJs we need.

42:51.152 --> 42:54.489
-I know people who spin records, come on.
-I doubt you know who we need.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.990
Look, the fact is, and Mr. and Mrs. Cruz,

42:57.074 --> 42:59.242
you may wanna close your ears
for a second,

42:59.327 --> 43:03.581
but the top DJs, the real tastemakers,
are all...

43:04.581 --> 43:08.503
by and large... homosexuals.

43:09.753 --> 43:10.588

They're rebels.

43:17.552 --> 43:20.847
They're cutting edge. You can't get
into their clubs without knowing somebody.

43:20.931 --> 43:22.809
So, what do we do?

43:22.891 --> 43:25.228
-We're gonna go to the record pool.
-What's that?

43:25.311 --> 43:28.773
The record pool is where they distribute
all the latest singles to the DJs.

43:29.356 --> 43:33.068
And most of these singles
are rejects from the record companies

43:33.152 --> 43:35.445
because the record companies
don't know beans.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.740
But Leslie Lesgold knows beans.

43:39.242 --> 43:40.992
And knows hits, too.

43:41.077 --> 43:43.161
Who's this Leslie Lesgold?

43:43.246 --> 43:46.039
Yes, and is he a homosexual?
Because if so--

43:46.123 --> 43:48.208
Leslie Lesgold is a nice Jewish girl.

43:48.291 --> 43:49.710
I respect the Jewish faith.

-<i>Es basura.</i>

46:21.612 --> 46:24.489
Hey, hold up a second, y'all.
Mylene. Mylene.

46:26.659 --> 46:28.952
You let him take my record
and scratch it all up.

46:29.036 --> 46:31.246
-It ain't like that.
-You didn't say anything.

46:31.329 --> 46:34.416
Well, maybe I didn't say anything
because there was nothing to say.

46:34.833 --> 46:35.751
-You saw what he was doing.
-Listen to me.

46:35.835 --> 46:37.961
What he was doing,
that's what we do, okay?

46:38.045 --> 46:40.422
We do it to all great records.
It doesn't hurt them.

46:41.172 --> 46:42.173
He was scratching it.

46:43.009 --> 46:45.844
That's the art. We know how to scratch it
without scratching the record.

46:46.762 --> 46:49.639
I would never let anyone hurt
your beautiful record, Mylene.

46:51.559 --> 46:53.561
-You really liked it?
-More than liked it.

46:54.936 --> 46:57.815
I need another copy so I can
play it again and again and again.

46:58.106 --> 47:00.735
No, you need another copy
so you scratch it all over.

47:01.402 --> 47:02.235
That, too.

47:02.695 --> 47:08.576
But I do wanna play it
over and over and over.

47:10.202 --> 47:11.704
Why you being so sexy right now?

47:11.954 --> 47:12.788
You tell me.

47:13.914 --> 47:15.291
What's happening to you?

47:15.875 --> 47:17.333
I'm just trying to keep up with you.

47:19.420 --> 47:22.297
I gotta get back in and practice.
Can I please get that record?

47:25.300 --> 47:28.387
Sure. For a kiss.

47:42.525 --> 47:44.652
Go in there and practice,
my little gigolo.

47:45.237 --> 47:46.197
Hey!

47:47.572 --> 47:51.786
Not for nothing but, Zeke was kind of
sexy the way he was talking to you.

47:52.327 --> 47:53.329
I know, right?

47:53.661 --> 47:54.954
All manly and shit.

-Get Down Brothers for life.
-That's what I'm talking about.

48:27.237 --> 48:28.364
That's some rumble in the jungle.

48:28.447 --> 48:31.199
The Notorious Three is getting
knocked the fuck out.

48:37.206 --> 48:38.123
Thor.

48:41.418 --> 48:42.253
Who's Thor?

48:44.463 --> 48:45.380
Just this white boy.

48:47.257 --> 48:48.425
He got styles.

48:50.635 --> 48:51.804
Yeah, he does.

48:59.936 --> 49:01.021
We're doing it, right?

49:02.648 --> 49:04.275
Yup. You're definitely doing it.

49:06.110 --> 49:08.445
I'm gonna walk in that record pool
with Jackie and the girls tomorrow

49:08.528 --> 49:11.447
and show the hottest,
most fashionable disco DJs in New York

49:11.532 --> 49:13.367
that I'm the one they've been looking for.

49:13.909 --> 49:14.909
Hell yeah, you are.

49:14.994 --> 49:17.246
And you're gonna do the same as me
at Mr. Gunns' house,

49:17.329 --> 49:19.706
and impress the shit out of him, right?

49:19.789 --> 49:21.208
Yeah, maybe.

49:21.291 --> 49:22.126
No, you better.

49:22.668 --> 49:25.378
Because of I get out of the Bronx
and you find a way out too

49:25.461 --> 49:26.880
then we can be together forever.

49:30.050 --> 49:32.385
Because I'm gonna be there
with you the whole time.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.222
Just pin it right there.

49:37.682 --> 49:38.684
Just over your heart.

49:40.143 --> 49:40.978
Thanks.

49:41.936 --> 49:43.646
We're gonna set ourselves free, Zeke.

49:45.690 --> 49:48.735
Tomorrow night's the night
that's gonna change everything.

49:49.945 --> 49:50.820
Yeah?

49:50.905 --> 49:54.115
And we still got our plan, right?
To be free?

49:56.034 --> 49:57.994
Free together till the end of time, right?

49:58.579 --> 49:59.413
Right.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.349
Shaolin.

50:20.516 --> 50:22.936
You do tiger style,
defeat the Notorious Three.

50:23.646 --> 50:24.896
Whoo!

50:24.980 --> 50:27.233
Tiger style defeats Notorious eagle claw
every time, Boo.

50:27.315 --> 50:29.568
I hope that hit somebody.

50:29.652 --> 50:30.485
Probably did.

50:31.110 --> 50:32.153
I gotta go take a leak.

50:32.570 --> 50:34.155
Go all the way to the other side.

50:34.657 --> 50:36.074
Gonna piss on your heads.

50:38.952 --> 50:40.371
Hey, little Grasshopper.

50:41.079 --> 50:42.623
Let me see your iron fist.

50:43.164 --> 50:44.958
Hey, why you throwing cans at him, man?

50:45.041 --> 50:46.960
-Take a piss.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's my little brother.

50:47.043 --> 50:48.170
Now shut up.

50:53.092 --> 50:54.260
What do we have here?

51:00.306 --> 51:01.891
All we find all we keep.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.148
Used to stick us for our lunch money.

51:08.231 --> 51:10.233
- Sure it's him?
- Yeah, it's him.

51:10.733 --> 51:12.987
Yeah. Rise and shine, Napoleon.

51:13.152 --> 51:15.822
The fuck you doing on our turf, punk?
