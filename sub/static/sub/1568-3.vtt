WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.251
Previously on "The 100"...

00:03.504 --> 00:05.129
Where's Clarke?

00:05.339 --> 00:06.422
Clarke's not here.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.007
The grounders
took them.

00:08.217 --> 00:09.842
You didn't send
that search team out, did you?

00:12.596 --> 00:13.763
I'm going after them.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.684
Bring them home.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.268
Welcome to
Mount Weather.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.229
This place is
too good to be true.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.647
You sound like
a crazy person.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.024
We're guests here,
not prisoners.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.651
Clarke, no!

00:26.860 --> 00:28.277
You pull that lever,
these people will die.

00:28.487 --> 00:29.821
Even a little radiation
could kill them.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.407
Your DNA ran
the same gauntlet

00:32.616 --> 00:33.700
as the grounders.

00:33.909 --> 00:36.452
Your ability to
metabolize that radiation

00:36.662 --> 00:37.704
is even stronger.

00:50.634 --> 00:51.718
Anya?

01:03.355 --> 01:04.731
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.379
Come on.

01:30.049 --> 01:31.257
Oh, damn it.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.930
OK.
Come on. Quick.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.065
Get back in.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.867
Hey. No.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.389
OK. We've gotta go.
Now.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.755
What is that?

03:39.803 --> 03:41.721
- I don't know.
- Aah!

03:45.851 --> 03:46.976
Ahh.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.442
What? Oh, my God.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.529
Oh, my God.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.740
Anya! Take my hand.

04:16.340 --> 04:17.506
We're out.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.721
Hey.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.432
Come on.
Get dressed.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.226
We can't cover any
ground like this.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.104
I won't leave
my people behind.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.027
Anya, now,
listen to me.

04:38.237 --> 04:40.529
My people are still
inside that place, too,

04:40.739 --> 04:41.822
but they
have guards.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.032
They have weapons.

04:43.242 --> 04:44.325
Once we get out
of here,

04:44.534 --> 04:45.326
we can find help.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.410
We can come back.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.703
There is no "we."

04:52.918 --> 04:54.085
Someone's coming.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.426
Not just someone
reapers.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.434
Hey. Anya,
you can't fight.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.978
You can hardly stand.

05:12.187 --> 05:13.271
I got a better idea.
Come on.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.543
Prisoners were last seen
at lights out,

06:59.753 --> 07:00.920
so, they must've
left sometime

07:01.129 --> 07:02.213
in the past 6 hours.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.298
Safe to say they
headed for their dropship.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.633
But we'll put Davis
on the search team

07:05.842 --> 07:06.634
just to be safe.

07:06.843 --> 07:07.760
He taught
earth skills.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.053
He's dying to get
some practical--

07:09.262 --> 07:10.679
we're not sending
out a search team.

07:12.182 --> 07:15.226
That'll put even
more lives at risk.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.645
I'm more worried about finding
the people who helped them..

07:18.855 --> 07:20.231
You wanted
to see me?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.652
Thank you, major.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.537
Tell me it wasn't you.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.837
Are we really
back to this?

07:44.297 --> 07:46.549
On the ark, you did
anything you wanted.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.718
Without a second thought
about the consequences.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.554
On the ark, I did
what I needed to do,

07:51.763 --> 07:52.721
and I was right.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.307
Just like now.

07:55.517 --> 07:58.394
Letting prisoners go.
Arming them.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.940
Those are
serious crimes, Abby.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.900
As chancellor, you can't
expect me to just--

08:05.110 --> 08:07.736
you weren't
elected chancellor, Marcus.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.113
You only got
the job because

08:09.322 --> 08:11.073
Thelonious beat you
to redemption.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.632
All right, Murphy.
Where to now?

08:30.469 --> 08:32.261
What say we lose
these first, huh?

08:32.471 --> 08:33.637
No. Again.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.805
If we get attacked
out here,

08:35.015 --> 08:36.307
I have nothing
to defend myself with.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.433
I don't care.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.148
Thank you.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.068
Hey. What the hell
are you doing?

08:48.278 --> 08:49.403
It was your idea
to bring him.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.155
Yeah, because he's
the only one who's seen

08:51.364 --> 08:52.823
where the grounders
keep their prisoners.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.283
Then we probably
shouldn't let him

08:54.493 --> 08:55.493
be defenseless
out here.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.912
We can
handle Murphy.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.121
Better hope so.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.916
So, do I get
a gun now?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.315
You're going
after the reapers.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.400
Lincoln taught me
how to fight. Let me help.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.196
Kill her.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.824
I'm gonna
open my eyes now.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.075
No! No peeking.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.287
OK. OK. Uh...

10:21.496 --> 10:23.330
Where are you
taking me, anyway?

10:23.540 --> 10:24.873
Does the concept
of surprise

10:25.083 --> 10:26.834
mean something
different in space?

10:27.043 --> 10:29.211
You should know I don't
like surprises.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.963
I hate them, actually.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.215
Trust me. You're gonna like
this one.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.258
Open.

10:42.559 --> 10:43.934
Oh, wow.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.981
Um, this one's
my favorite.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.483
Wallace goes in for
landscapes and impressionists,

10:51.693 --> 10:54.320
but my taste runs
a little darker.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.372
Beautiful, isn't it?

11:06.791 --> 11:09.168
Yeah. It is.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.381
I don't know why
they keep it all

11:14.591 --> 11:16.175
locked up down here.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.676
It's pretty cool.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.938
Hey. Who's in here?

11:30.148 --> 11:31.065
Come on.

11:39.866 --> 11:40.949
You think
we lost them?

11:41.159 --> 11:42.242
I actually don't think

11:42.452 --> 11:44.161
anyone was ever
chasing us.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.330
Jasper, have you
seen Clarke?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.623
Uh, no.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.042
Nobody has. Hi.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.419
Hi. Um,
you guys should--

11:52.629 --> 11:54.922
no. No, we're
having breakfast.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.009
Gonna meet you
in line?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.016
I've got
a bad feeling.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.061
Look, I'd love to
talk to you about Clarke,

12:09.270 --> 12:10.688
any time in my
entire life

12:10.897 --> 12:13.190
other than
right now, OK?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.441
What if
she's in trouble?

12:14.651 --> 12:17.736
Trouble?
It's Clarke.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.947
Whatever she's up to,
I'm sure she can handle it.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.663
OK, come on.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.340
What are you doing?
Let's go.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.866
Everybody down.
Down.

13:48.745 --> 13:49.745
This is it.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.082
Told you I'd find it.

13:56.795 --> 13:57.961
See nothing
but grounders.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.676
Our people
aren't here.

14:04.886 --> 14:05.844
Wait a minute.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.513
They've got stuff
from our dropship.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.935
So, maybe they know
where our friends are.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.728
Or maybe they
killed them already.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.398
Sonofabitch.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.235
What is it?

14:21.444 --> 14:22.486
The guy with
the one eye.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.448
Around his neck.

14:29.244 --> 14:29.952
What am I
looking at?

14:30.161 --> 14:31.578
He's got Clarke's watch.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.374
It was her father's.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.461
She wouldn't give that up
without a fight.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.050
Neither will we.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.934
OK. You're
with me.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.936
You two, stay here,
out of sight.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.522
This thing goes South,
take out the other grounders,

14:58.731 --> 15:00.566
but don't shoot the grounder
with the watch.

15:00.775 --> 15:01.567
Copy?

15:01.776 --> 15:03.235
Copy.
Copy.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.528
What about Murphy?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.196
Yeah, do I get
a gun now?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.281
Something like that.

16:04.088 --> 16:04.963
Uhh!

16:12.263 --> 16:13.597
We need to take him
somewhere quiet.

16:14.766 --> 16:15.933
I know just the place.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.702
You sent
for me, sir?

16:35.912 --> 16:37.412
Dr. Griffin has
confessed to helping

16:37.622 --> 16:39.498
those boys escape
and giving them guns.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.876
She's to be supervised
at all times

16:43.086 --> 16:44.544
and confined to quarters
when not at work.

16:44.754 --> 16:45.587
Is that clear?

16:50.301 --> 16:52.094
What is it, major?
Spit it out.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.929
Unauthorized use
of firearms

16:54.138 --> 16:56.515
and aiding and abetting
a prison escape are felonies.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.183
The exodus charter
is clear.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.559
The punishment
is shocklashing.

17:01.604 --> 17:02.646
I know she's
your friend...

17:02.855 --> 17:04.356
She's not just
my friend.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.149
She's a former
member of the council

17:06.359 --> 17:07.943
and the most respected
person in this camp.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.861
Yes, sir, which is
why it will work

17:10.071 --> 17:10.988
as a deterrent.

17:13.658 --> 17:18.453
On the ark, we had to be ruthless,
uncompromising.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.330
Our hand
was always forced.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.459
But down here...

17:24.669 --> 17:26.086
We have a chance
to start over.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.547
Make something
better.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.008
I hope that day
will come, sir.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.801
But if we lose
control of this camp--

17:33.011 --> 17:34.886
and we're on
the knife's edge already--

17:35.096 --> 17:37.347
we won't live long enough
to have that chance.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.266
Grab somebody...

17:39.475 --> 17:41.059
A patrol.
The grounder prisoner.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.144
They're bringing him
in now.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.865
Let that man through!

17:55.074 --> 17:57.409
No one is to touch him!
Stand back!

17:57.618 --> 17:59.286
They have my son!
They have my son!

17:59.495 --> 18:02.414
Where is my son?
Where is my son? I want--

18:04.042 --> 18:05.667
Medic! We need
a medic here!

18:09.213 --> 18:10.047
What the hell happened?

18:10.256 --> 18:11.381
He went for
my weapon.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.716
Kept saying the grounders
have his son.

18:12.925 --> 18:13.884
The gun
just went off.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.137
Get him to medical now.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.981
The knife's
edge, sir.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.316
Take the prisoner
inside.

18:30.985 --> 18:34.821
Go! Everybody stay back.
Stand back!

19:28.793 --> 19:30.168
Nice to see you, too.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.963
Sorry. I was hoping
you were Clarke.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.047
You still haven't
seen her?

19:34.257 --> 19:36.133
No.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.009
I don't think she slept
in her bed last night.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.224
What do we do?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.564
Maya has access to everything
through her job.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.358
Maybe she could
snoop around.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.945
If Clarke's in trouble,
she can find out.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.531
I don't know.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.575
Clarke doesn't
trust them.

20:01.784 --> 20:02.742
What if she's right?

20:05.621 --> 20:06.663
We can trust Maya.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.251
At least,
I think we can.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.299
Besides...What choice
do we have?

20:24.557 --> 20:27.517
Damn it.
This place is a maze.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.398
What are they
doing to us?

20:34.567 --> 20:35.609
They use
your blood.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.821
I saw a soldier come in
with radiation burns.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.364
Hours later,
he was fine.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.825
It's like your blood
is healing them somehow.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.202
I've never seen
anything like it.

20:46.913 --> 20:47.787
Come on.
This way.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.627
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing?

20:53.836 --> 20:55.587
That's the way back
to the reapers.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.881
You go your way,
I'll go mine.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.008
Anya, we need
to stick together.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.676
I told you
there is no "we."

21:01.886 --> 21:02.886
I saved your life.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.472
You saved my life
because you need me.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.474
I know the way back
to your people.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.143
I know where the
traps are hidden.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.270
You'd never
make it alone.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.189
We don't have time
for this.

21:14.398 --> 21:18.235
Our best chance of making it out
of here alive is together.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.111
All we can do is
keep moving and hope--

21:23.241 --> 21:24.115
Anya.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.328
Anya?

21:58.901 --> 22:00.277
Stop!

22:00.486 --> 22:01.903
We strike
from the shadows

22:02.113 --> 22:03.947
when they stop to feed
on our bait.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.198
So, I'm the bait?

22:05.408 --> 22:08.034
No. You are
a warrior.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.037
She's the bait.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.133
I am not afraid.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.136
You will be.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.749
Oh, no.

22:59.128 --> 22:59.919
No, no.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.172
Please.

23:10.181 --> 23:11.514
Get back!

23:11.724 --> 23:13.600
Get the hell
away from her! Now!

23:18.814 --> 23:20.982
Clarke Griffin,
you're coming with us.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.237
Jackson, find out
if he has any family.

23:31.452 --> 23:32.911
You need to come
with us, ma'am.

24:04.318 --> 24:06.361
What is this?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.405
I'm sorry it had to
come to this, Abby.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.951
But you left me
no choice.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.453
Abigail Griffin
has confessed

24:15.663 --> 24:17.914
to aiding and abetting
known criminals.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.126
And trafficking
in firearms.

24:21.335 --> 24:24.295
Under the laws set forth in
the exodus charter of the ark,

24:24.505 --> 24:26.548
she's been sentenced
to 10 lashes.

24:30.261 --> 24:31.719
You can't be serious.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.640
On your command,
chancellor Kane.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.505
We don't have
to do this down here.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.228
Proceed.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.521
Aah!

25:28.944 --> 25:29.819
Again.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.114
Aah!

25:46.003 --> 25:46.961
Again.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.553
Aah!

25:57.139 --> 25:58.014
Ohh!

26:09.443 --> 26:10.360
Again.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.795
Aah!

26:41.433 --> 26:42.892
We're gonna
do this again,

26:43.102 --> 26:45.603
and this time you're gonna
stop screwing with us.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.772
Where did you
find this?

26:47.982 --> 26:51.442
I told you.
I found it outside your camp.

26:51.652 --> 26:52.944
He's lying.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.529
She would never
take it off voluntarily.

26:54.738 --> 26:55.572
I know.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.032
Where is the girl

26:58.242 --> 26:59.617
who was wearing
this watch?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.745
I never saw a girl.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.748
Another lie.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.625
I mean, maybe you should
stop asking him nicely.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.377
Shut up, Murphy.

27:09.587 --> 27:10.587
Where are our friends?

27:10.796 --> 27:11.754
You took them.
We know you did.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.172
Just tell us where.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.009
Murphy's right.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.135
We're wasting time.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.136
Uhh!

27:18.345 --> 27:19.178
Answer the question!

27:19.388 --> 27:20.471
Hey.
Where's the girl

27:20.681 --> 27:21.681
who was wearing
this watch?

27:21.890 --> 27:23.057
Finn, stop!

27:23.267 --> 27:24.892
You don't want
to do this. Trust me.

27:26.228 --> 27:28.730
There are some lines
you can't uncross.

27:39.450 --> 27:40.658
Where's Clarke?

27:40.868 --> 27:41.993
Uhh!
Where is she?

27:42.202 --> 27:43.661
Back off!

27:46.749 --> 27:47.874
Put down the gun, Finn.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.213
3 seconds.

27:55.883 --> 27:56.758
Two!

27:59.011 --> 27:59.844
One.

28:00.054 --> 28:01.721
OK!

28:01.930 --> 28:03.056
I'll tell you.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.185
Your friends
are east of here.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.896
The village where we
take our prisoners of war.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.606
East? Where?

28:11.815 --> 28:13.066
How do we get to them?

28:13.275 --> 28:14.901
I can draw you a map.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.110
But you should hurry.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.029
Soon they'll outlive
their usefulness.

28:20.699 --> 28:21.991
Get him something
to draw a map.

28:31.585 --> 28:33.336
You thought I was
the crazy one, huh?

28:45.891 --> 28:47.016
Answer the question.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.605
Answer the question!

29:04.451 --> 29:05.702
Holster that weapon.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.121
Those men you killed
were my men.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.081
I said stand down.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.002
Now!

29:30.811 --> 29:31.853
You get some air.

29:33.689 --> 29:34.814
That's an order.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.121
We can't keep this up...

29:52.332 --> 29:53.499
And hope to survive.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.011
There's gotta be
a better way.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.272
She's in.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.671
Uhh!
Uhhhh!

30:40.881 --> 30:42.215
Yah!

30:51.934 --> 30:52.767
Uhh!

30:55.103 --> 30:56.562
Uhh!

31:08.867 --> 31:09.742
Lincoln.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.036
Where's Lincoln?

31:14.748 --> 31:15.998
Where is Lincoln?

31:16.208 --> 31:18.000
Please. Was
Lincoln with you?

31:53.412 --> 31:54.745
You find out
something?

31:54.955 --> 31:55.788
What is it?

31:57.291 --> 32:00.960
Apparently, Clarke had
some kind of breakdown.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.587
She just snapped.

32:02.796 --> 32:03.963
Started pulling
out her stitches,

32:04.172 --> 32:05.339
trying to
hurt herself.

32:05.549 --> 32:06.424
Where is she now?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.845
Psych ward.
Being monitored.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.638
I talked to a friend who
works there.

32:12.848 --> 32:13.931
She thinks it might
be a couple days

32:14.141 --> 32:15.766
before the doctors
let anyone see her.

32:20.856 --> 32:25.318
We'll
see about that.

32:25.527 --> 32:28.154
Hey...I'm sorry.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.699
Last time I saw her,
I called her crazy.

32:33.744 --> 32:34.952
I never thought--

32:36.997 --> 32:38.331
she's gonna be OK.

32:49.551 --> 32:50.509
I saw everything.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.261
I know what you're
doing to them.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.972
That's why you're going in the
harvest chamber with them.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.684
Alpha-delta two,
we've reached the intake.

32:58.894 --> 33:00.436
One prisoner
in custody.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.813
Your mission was to
bring back both of them.

33:03.023 --> 33:05.066
The outsider cannot be
allowed to leave this Mountain.

33:05.275 --> 33:06.817
Alpha-delta one is
coming out now.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.110
Aaaah!

33:10.656 --> 33:11.614
Aah!

33:11.823 --> 33:13.449
His mask!

33:13.659 --> 33:14.492
Uhh!

33:16.078 --> 33:17.870
I found a way out.
This way.

33:26.296 --> 33:27.672
We need to take them on.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.781
Wait. There has
to be another way.

33:53.991 --> 33:55.408
There isn't.

33:55.617 --> 33:56.867
Just give up, Clarke.

33:57.077 --> 33:58.327
You have no place else to go.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.333
Anya!

34:07.170 --> 34:08.629
We don't have
to kill you, Clarke.

34:08.839 --> 34:10.631
Do you hear me?

34:10.841 --> 34:12.216
It doesn't have
to end like this.

34:15.804 --> 34:16.929
Just surrender.

34:19.182 --> 34:20.057
Hands up.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.066
Take the prisoner.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.321
Thank you, Jackson.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.413
So? Did it work?

35:27.876 --> 35:29.627
Is the rest of the camp
back in line?

35:32.172 --> 35:33.464
This wasn't
something I...

35:35.383 --> 35:36.342
I considered
lightly.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.219
You don't have
to justify yourself.

35:38.428 --> 35:41.847
I broke the rules and
I accept the consequences.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.808
But you can lash me
a hundred times

35:44.017 --> 35:45.935
and I am still gonna
do whatever it takes

35:46.144 --> 35:47.144
to find those kids.

35:48.814 --> 35:49.897
My kid.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.149
I know that.

35:52.359 --> 35:53.651
Then I guess
we're done here.

36:01.535 --> 36:03.119
I'm leading a mission
to bring them back.

36:08.458 --> 36:12.211
This won't be a...
Bunch of kids

36:12.420 --> 36:13.462
looking to stir up
a fight...

36:15.215 --> 36:17.633
But a diplomatic
mission

36:17.843 --> 36:19.927
to make contact
with the grounders' commander...

36:21.721 --> 36:23.389
And negotiate
for peace.

36:23.598 --> 36:24.515
I'm taking the
grounder prisoner

36:24.724 --> 36:25.766
with me to guide
the way.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.728
Marcus, he could be
leading you into a trap.

36:31.857 --> 36:32.731
Perhaps.

36:34.985 --> 36:36.152
It'll give us
a chance.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.700
I did hear you,
you know.

36:44.870 --> 36:45.911
Then I'll go
with you.

36:46.121 --> 36:49.915
No. No, you're
needed here at camp.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.250
No, Jackson can
handle medical.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.710
It's not just your
medical expertise

36:52.919 --> 36:54.003
that'll be required.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.714
I need to know that
while I'm away,

36:56.923 --> 36:59.383
you'll set a good example
for our people.

36:59.593 --> 37:02.052
If you do this, I'll be
a model citizen.

37:04.681 --> 37:05.890
I need you to be
more than that.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.560
I need you
to be chancellor.

37:18.528 --> 37:19.570
Please, Abby.

37:21.948 --> 37:22.865
For your people.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.265
Thank you.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.480
I think we should go back
to the dropship first.

38:36.690 --> 38:37.940
So I can see
who my people...

38:41.027 --> 38:42.945
We're not going back
to your dropship.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.782
You killed 300
of my warriors.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.159
I can't show my face
without a prize.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.750
Gather up the gear.
We're leaving.

38:58.003 --> 38:58.877
What about him?

39:01.798 --> 39:03.090
For now,
we leave him.

39:03.300 --> 39:04.383
Deal with him
when we're done.

39:04.592 --> 39:05.551
What if he escapes?

39:05.760 --> 39:06.760
He knows exactly
where we're going.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.345
We're not
killing him.

39:08.555 --> 39:09.888
I'm not really
seeing another option here.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.765
If we don't
take care of this now,

39:11.975 --> 39:13.392
this is gonna blow back
on us and you know that.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.601
He's unarmed, Murphy.

39:14.811 --> 39:15.853
He's a grounder.

39:18.106 --> 39:20.399
Really? Come on.
Tell him.

39:20.608 --> 39:21.400
I don't know.

39:21.609 --> 39:22.735
You don't know what?

39:22.944 --> 39:24.570
He's gonna tell his
people everything.

39:24.779 --> 39:25.904
We're as good
as dead.

39:26.114 --> 39:26.989
Our friends, too.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.824
We're not
doing this.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.784
End of discussion. You want him, you
gotta go through me.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.494
And what exactly happened
to you, huh?

39:32.704 --> 39:34.121
You're talking like you've never
killed a grounder before.

39:34.331 --> 39:35.414
That was in battle.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.458
This would be an execution.

39:46.801 --> 39:47.885
Let's get moving.

40:18.875 --> 40:21.877
If you're gonna kill me,
get it over with.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.922
You proved yourself well,
Octavia of the sky people.

40:27.509 --> 40:28.717
We'll let you live.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.520
Lincoln was
a good man.

40:39.729 --> 40:40.813
He was my brother.

41:16.349 --> 41:18.892
All right. Next.

41:24.524 --> 41:25.399
Harvest.

41:27.986 --> 41:28.861
Harvest.

41:31.072 --> 41:32.030
Harvest.

41:37.287 --> 41:39.621
Mark this one for
the Cerberus program.
