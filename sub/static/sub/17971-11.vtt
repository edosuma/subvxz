(chuckles)

00:33.633 --> 00:35.901
Rallo, are you done
with the internet?

00:35.903 --> 00:38.937
Because I need to find some
data about building a rocket

00:38.939 --> 00:40.305
for the school
science fair,

00:40.307 --> 00:42.641
because they're having
a science fair at school,

00:42.643 --> 00:45.177
and I want to build
a rocket for it.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.545
Take a knee, Chubs.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.446
I'm wrapping it up.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.714
You'd be amazed
how many people

00:48.716 --> 00:52.217
on the internet want
to meet a five-year-old boy.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.686
Move it, Heavy C.

00:54.688 --> 00:55.754
This ain't the microwave.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.389
I need to update
my Facebook page

00:57.391 --> 01:00.526
with these slammin' pictures
of me in my new bikini.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.760
Facebook
is a joke.

01:01.762 --> 01:05.064
You know who is my friend
on Facebook?

01:05.066 --> 01:06.198
Margaret Cho.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.200
A woman
I have not met,

01:08.202 --> 01:10.169
nor wish
to ever meet,

01:10.171 --> 01:12.871
is somehow
a friend of mine.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.440
Puh-lease.

01:14.442 --> 01:17.810
I also don't need
your stupid status updates.

01:17.812 --> 01:21.480
Ooh, Betsy Sherman is excited
to watch <i>Heroes.</i>

01:21.482 --> 01:23.649
Go suck an egg,
Betsy!

01:23.651 --> 01:24.883
You know what?

01:24.885 --> 01:27.119
I need
to Twitter that.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.188
Go... suck...

01:29.190 --> 01:32.191
an egg...
Betsy.

01:33.860 --> 01:36.495
Guys notice
anything different?

01:36.497 --> 01:37.129
No.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.363
Put your finger
in my nose.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.765
Okay.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.066
Mm. Smooth.

01:41.068 --> 01:43.769
Yeah, you bet it is,
thanks to the Nasalaser.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.672
Laser-guided system burns
follicles at the root.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.840
Same one Joe Buck uses.

01:47.842 --> 01:48.974
That's a clever
invention.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.043
I got the inventor
bug myself.

01:51.045 --> 01:52.878
Among other bugs.
And crabs.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.580
What kind of stuff
you invent, Lester?

01:54.582 --> 01:56.915
Well, I got something
called the Buddy Beer.

01:56.917 --> 01:57.783
Give me a sec.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.018
You know, I never leave home
without the prototype.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.954
It's a beer bottle
with two necks,

02:01.956 --> 02:06.391
so if you're short on cash,
you and a buddy can share it.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.130
Oh, yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.668
<i>We</i> sshould invent
something!

02:16.670 --> 02:19.371
I've always wanted
to be an inventor.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.939
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:20.941 --> 02:24.676
what if I told you
you could have a cracker

02:24.678 --> 02:26.345
that's also a phone?

02:26.347 --> 02:28.247
Boom. The i-Ritz.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.848
(touch tones sounding)

02:29.850 --> 02:33.252
I just made a call on a cracker!

02:33.254 --> 02:34.786
I just ate a phone!

02:34.788 --> 02:35.888
MAN:
That's stupid!

02:35.890 --> 02:37.122
<i>You're</i> sstupid!

02:37.124 --> 02:38.757
I got a
couple
of ideas,

02:38.759 --> 02:40.626
uh, rattling
around the
old noodle.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.928
Hell, I got notebooks
of ideas.

02:42.930 --> 02:43.996
And song lyrics.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.031
♪ Done farted

02:46.033 --> 02:47.933
♪ Done farted

02:47.935 --> 02:49.801

02:49.803 --> 02:51.370

02:51.372 --> 02:53.672

♪ Eh-da, duh, farta

02:55.976 --> 02:57.276
That's
the spirit!

02:57.278 --> 02:59.478
Let's everybody come up
with an invention,

02:59.480 --> 03:02.047
and we'll meet back here
tomorrow night.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.316
(cheering)
All right!

03:04.450 --> 03:06.718
Don't look.
It's Margaret Cho.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.253
MARGARET CHO:
Cleveland?

03:08.255 --> 03:09.655
Damn.

03:15.428 --> 03:17.429
Mm. Better get my wood
to woodshop.

03:17.431 --> 03:22.401
I'm making you a mad large key
to hang all your other keys on.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.803
This is real, yo.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.839
(school bell ringing)

03:27.841 --> 03:29.975
Roberta, the bell has rang.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.443
Rung. Rang?

03:31.445 --> 03:32.911
The bell has rang.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.680
The bell has rung. Hmm.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.348
The bell went (trilling),

03:36.350 --> 03:38.083
and you're going
to be late for class.

03:38.085 --> 03:41.687
I'm sorry. I just need one
minute to make sure I look good.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.623
Do you think I look
good, Mr. Armstrong?

03:44.625 --> 03:45.624
Kiss me.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.292
You didn't hear that.
Hear what?

03:47.294 --> 03:49.861
(laughs)
Nothing to hear. Okay.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.965
(echoing): They'll never
find me up here.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.834
TEACHER:
You're tardy,
Ms. Tubbs.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.369
I'm sorry, Mr. Elmore.

03:57.371 --> 04:01.707
I was taking a <i>long,</i>
<i>soapy shower after P.E. and...</i>

04:01.709 --> 04:03.075
Ouch.

04:03.077 --> 04:03.909
Who are you?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.612
I'm Ms. Eck,
Mr. Elmore's replacement,

04:06.614 --> 04:10.048
and I do not tolerate
tardiness, Ms. Tubbs.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.550
A C-minus?!

04:11.552 --> 04:13.051
If you have a problem
with your grade,

04:13.053 --> 04:14.720
you can see me
after class.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.356
Now, please
take your seat.

04:19.058 --> 04:20.492
Ignore that.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.428
(school bell ringing)

04:24.764 --> 04:26.665
I have seen this
before, you know.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.433
Pretty girl,
coasting by on her looks.

04:28.435 --> 04:32.137
Taking life for granted because
everything is handed to her.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.839
I get things
handed to me

04:33.841 --> 04:36.508
because I'm smart and
funny and talented.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.877
Yes, my body is
re-donk-a-donk-ulous,

04:38.879 --> 04:40.979
but I'm also
very likable.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.015
I'm like a black Halle Berry.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.116
Sit down.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.485
I want to show you something.

04:47.987 --> 04:51.790
This is Pam Anderson in 1997.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.859
This is her today.

04:53.861 --> 04:54.526
(gasps)

04:54.528 --> 04:59.131
Kirsten Dunst, June 10, 2004.

04:59.133 --> 05:02.301
This is her four days later.

05:02.835 --> 05:06.171
Meg Ryan, 1989.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.472
And now.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.540
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

05:08.542 --> 05:10.575
Turn it off!

05:10.577 --> 05:13.145
You know,
I myself used to be doable.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.946
Well, what happened?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.415
I turned 30.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.482
I'll make a deal with you.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.619
If you can prove that your life
would be just as easy

05:20.621 --> 05:23.855
if you were unattractive,
then I'll raise this C to an A.

05:23.857 --> 05:27.025
It's the only way you can prove
that you can succeed

05:27.027 --> 05:29.661
based on who you are
on the inside.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.896
Deal?

05:30.898 --> 05:31.797
Deal.

05:31.799 --> 05:35.534
But how am I supposed
to make this ugly?

05:36.569 --> 05:37.836
A fat suit?

05:37.838 --> 05:40.706
(gasps)
Just like Tyra Banks.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.374
Hollywood costume shop.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.408
High quality.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.043
Look at this fupa.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.712
Look at this poopa.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.114
Fupa. Poopa.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.515
Fupa. Poopa.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.451
Ah, what a good time.

05:54.587 --> 05:55.854
Okay, my
invention

05:55.856 --> 05:58.090
is magnetic
fly jeans.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.291
Easy to get
off and on,

05:59.293 --> 06:00.959
and if you're
bear-hairy

06:00.961 --> 06:02.127
down there,
like I am,

06:02.129 --> 06:03.995
there's no
more worrying

06:03.997 --> 06:06.064
about the zipper
jaws of death.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.600
Don't need it. Shaved.
And waxed.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.602
I got a chicken wing glove.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.170
It's got razor blades
on the fingers

06:12.172 --> 06:15.507
to pull the meat off the bones,
wet naps on the pinky,

06:15.509 --> 06:18.977
and the thumb's
a blue cheese dispenser.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.983
(bleep) thing.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.619
Okay, I got
a gum reflavorizor.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.922
You put new flavor in your gum
with a syringe thing.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.591
Uh, Shirtflix.com

06:32.593 --> 06:34.626
It's like Netflix,
but with shirts.

06:34.628 --> 06:38.563
And a fart amplification device,
which is self-explanatory.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.199
What'd you come up with,
Terry, hmm?

06:41.201 --> 06:42.000
Aw, nothing, man.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.802
Nah, I forgot we
were even doing this.

06:43.804 --> 06:47.672
Holt, slide me one
of those beers, will you?

06:49.809 --> 06:52.477
(grunts)

06:52.479 --> 06:53.078
Thank you.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.147
Hey, that's what someone
should invent--

06:55.149 --> 06:58.183
a device where
you can slide a beer to someone.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.084
How handy would that be?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.820
Bars all over the
world would buy that.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.823
A coaster that rolls.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.691
The Roller Coaster.

07:06.693 --> 07:11.530
Gentlemen, I think we just
invented an invention.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.432
(cheering and whooping)

07:13.434 --> 07:14.633
Yeah! (screams)

07:14.635 --> 07:15.634
What-What...?
What do I do?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.969
I think you're supposed
to put it in your rectum

07:17.971 --> 07:21.673
to maintain its body temperature
till you get to the hospital.

07:21.675 --> 07:22.707
Right, right, right.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.643
I knew that. Thanks, brah.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.687
Fug alert, yo!

07:35.689 --> 07:37.622
Hi. I'm Tyra.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.657
I'm new here.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.692
Can you show me
around the school?

07:40.694 --> 07:41.726
Step off, beast!

07:41.728 --> 07:44.996
I already got a shawty,
and she got mad ass, yo.

07:44.998 --> 07:45.831
Mad ass!

07:45.833 --> 07:50.168
Is-Is that the only reason
you like her, because she's hot?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.370
She's smart
and-and funny, too, right?

07:52.372 --> 07:55.607
What's party with
all these questions, Buggawoof?

07:55.609 --> 07:57.342
It don't matter
if she smart or funny,

07:57.344 --> 08:00.212
so long as I'm peepin'
dat sweet apple bottom

08:00.214 --> 08:01.413
and fine set of breasteses.

08:01.415 --> 08:04.082
Know what I'm sayin',
Omega Mu?

08:05.551 --> 08:07.018
(laughter)

08:07.020 --> 08:09.654
Excuse me, I know
you're new here,

08:09.656 --> 08:11.923
but that's no excuse
for tardiness.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.124
I'm sorry.

08:13.126 --> 08:16.661
I just needed one minute
to make sure I look good.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.498
Do you think I look good?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.368
Oh!
Aah!

08:23.370 --> 08:25.737
(screaming)

08:26.672 --> 08:27.739
Oh, wonderful.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.774
My antidepressants are in there.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.077
Five bucks a pop.

08:32.079 --> 08:36.014
Go get me a glass
of water, fatty.

08:40.786 --> 08:43.655
Gentlemen, I present
to you the...

08:43.657 --> 08:44.656
Peek-a-boo!

08:44.658 --> 08:47.025
Rallo?! Where's
the Roller Coaster?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.727
Chillax.
It's right here.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.128
Put the beer on it.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.596
You mean this
empty bottle?

08:51.598 --> 08:52.998
Wha...?
You drank the beer?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.133
Maybe. Give me a light.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.738
The Roller Coaster!

09:00.773 --> 09:01.706
Ooh!
Ooh!

09:01.708 --> 09:03.241
Mm, I gotta be honest.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.010
I ain't 100%
on the name.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.479
What... What's wrong
with the name?

09:07.481 --> 09:08.780
It's too obvious.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.349
How about something like
the Brew-Choo Train?

09:11.351 --> 09:14.986
The Brew-Choo... No, we're not
gonna call it the Bre...

09:14.988 --> 09:16.354
Ale aboard!

09:16.356 --> 09:17.789
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.757
We could change
the name.

09:18.759 --> 09:22.227
We could, or we could just stick
with the Roller Coaster,

09:22.229 --> 09:24.062
so, let's do that, okay?

09:24.064 --> 09:24.829
Cool.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.364
Well, how come
you get to decide?

09:26.366 --> 09:28.667
What, you think
just 'cause you're black,

09:28.669 --> 09:29.968
you're automatically the leader?

09:29.970 --> 09:31.436
No.
A little.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.672
All in favor of
Brew-Choo Train?

09:33.674 --> 09:34.406
Aye!
What?!

09:34.408 --> 09:35.740
Aye!
What's
happening?

09:35.742 --> 09:36.808
Aye! All for
Roller Coaster?

09:36.810 --> 09:38.877
Aye!
DONNA:
Rallo, tater tots!

09:38.879 --> 09:40.645
All right!

09:42.748 --> 09:43.515
(hollow clank)

09:43.517 --> 09:45.317
It's okay.
I'm drunk.

09:45.319 --> 09:46.785
Doesn't hurt.

09:50.022 --> 09:53.091
CLEVELAND JR.:
Do you mind
if I sit with you?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.326
Um...

09:55.061 --> 09:55.927
...okay.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.629
I'm Tyra.

09:57.631 --> 09:58.330
Nice to meet you, Tyra.

09:58.332 --> 10:01.800
I'm Student Council President
Cleveland Brown, Jr.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.234
I was the new kid recently,

10:03.236 --> 10:06.004
so I know how many buttholes
are at this school,

10:06.006 --> 10:08.740
but I'm sure
once people get to know you,

10:08.742 --> 10:10.208
you'll have lots of friends.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.743
Thank you, Cleveland Jr.

10:11.745 --> 10:16.381
That's the nicest thing
anybody has said to me in days.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.384
What's that?
It's a rocket.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.219
I'm building it
for the science fair,

10:21.221 --> 10:24.155
but it won't lift off because
the astronaut's too heavy.

10:24.157 --> 10:27.993
But if I take him out,
then it won't be authentic.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.260
Hmm.

10:29.262 --> 10:32.364
Well... maybe you could do this.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.102
That's a great idea!

10:37.104 --> 10:38.770
Thanks!
BOY:
You hear that, guys?

10:38.772 --> 10:43.375
Cleveland Jr. thinks this is
going to win the science fair.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.310
Well, what
are you guys making?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.444
We've translated
<i>Monty Python</i>

10:46.446 --> 10:48.046
<i>and the Holy Grail</i>
<i>into Klingon,</i>

10:48.048 --> 10:50.415
and we're going
to do a shot-for-shot,

10:50.417 --> 10:51.916
stop-motion remake
using vintage,

10:51.918 --> 10:53.284
new-in-box,
eight-inch,

10:53.286 --> 10:55.820
Mego DC Comics
action figures.

10:55.822 --> 10:56.421
TRIO:
Nerds!

10:56.423 --> 10:59.991
That does sound better
than a rocket.

10:59.993 --> 11:00.859
Uh-uh.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.828
Junior's going to win
that science fair,

11:03.830 --> 11:05.997
and I'm going to
help him do it.

11:05.999 --> 11:06.965
You are?

11:06.967 --> 11:07.932
Oh, boy.

11:07.934 --> 11:08.867
Who are you?

11:08.869 --> 11:11.736
(raspy):
I'm Fat Girl.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.439
(nerds gasping)

11:16.575 --> 11:19.844
It's the Alda-nator, converting
any voice into that of...

11:19.846 --> 11:21.846
(Alda's voice):
...TV star Alan Alda.

11:21.848 --> 11:22.914
You want to try?

11:22.916 --> 11:26.084
(Alda's voice): Um, I'm liberal
know-it-all Alan Alda.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.119
Holy crap,
this thing really works.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.355
Give me that.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.457
(phone rings)

11:32.459 --> 11:33.291
KENDRA:
Hello.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.528
(Alda's voice):
Kendra, it's Alan Alda.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.297
Oh... my... Lord.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.032
I just wanted to thank you
for the letters

11:41.034 --> 11:44.536
and tell you that I wish
all my fans were just like you.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.972
Oh, I love you, Mr. Alda.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.608
Thank you for calling.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.343
What?
I-I love my wife.

11:52.345 --> 11:56.481
If that makes me some kind
of homo, then so be it.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.783
(normal voice):
What the hell is this?

11:58.785 --> 11:59.984
I've tried to be diplomatic,

11:59.986 --> 12:02.954
but the Brew-Choo Train is
a stupid name.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.089
Look, I'm
the only one

12:04.091 --> 12:06.357
who knows what he's
doing in this group.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.426
It was my idea,
I did all the work,

12:08.428 --> 12:12.197
and now you want me to ruin
it with your stupid name?

12:12.199 --> 12:13.231
I don't think so.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.434
You know, Cleveland, I'm
getting sick of your face.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.001
Yeah, man,

12:17.003 --> 12:19.037
y-you know, y-y-you-
you-you're starting to,

12:19.039 --> 12:22.340
you're starting to put
yourself before the project,

12:22.342 --> 12:25.176
and you, sir,
are no Alan Parsons.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.945
Cleveland...
you're fired.

12:26.947 --> 12:30.348
Well, then, I'm
taking my sign.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.186
(Alda's voice):
Go (bleep) yourselves.

12:37.857 --> 12:39.624
Another failed launch.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.860
I'm starting to feel
like whoever's in charge

12:41.862 --> 12:44.929
of Fox's
live-action sitcoms.

12:44.931 --> 12:45.630
Wait a minute.

12:45.632 --> 12:46.598
The wind.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.567
We forgot to account
for wind resistance.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.401
Of course.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.003
We need to adjust
the trajectory

12:52.005 --> 12:53.872
at launch
to compensate.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.907
Wow, Tyra,
you're smart.

12:55.909 --> 12:56.407
Thank you.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.943
I've never been friends
with a girl before.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.512
Is it true
you guys can clap

13:00.514 --> 13:02.981
your breasts together
like a seal?

13:02.983 --> 13:03.414
No.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.518
Thanks a lot, Wikipedia.

13:12.458 --> 13:16.127
Three... two... one!

13:22.635 --> 13:23.968
(laughs)

13:23.970 --> 13:26.004
Yeah, real tough.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.716
This is still pretty cool!

13:38.718 --> 13:40.618
And the winner
of this year's

13:40.620 --> 13:44.022
Stoolbend High School
science fair is

13:44.024 --> 13:48.226
Cleveland Brown Jr.
and Tyra Obama.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.828
Whoo-hoo!
Hooray!

13:51.063 --> 13:53.898
That's A+
work, Tyra.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.633
Yay!

13:55.635 --> 14:00.572
(fanfare plays)

14:00.574 --> 14:03.541
Why did you do
that, Junior?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.210
Because I...

14:05.212 --> 14:07.078
I love you, Tyra.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.446
(theme music plays)

14:08.448 --> 14:10.982
Will these two fatties make
a love connection?

14:10.984 --> 14:15.253
We'll be back to let you know
in two and two.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.327
Good morning,
my beautiful family.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.796
Well, Junior,
you're in a good mood.

14:24.798 --> 14:27.665
It's because... I'm in love.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.734
In love?! Who is she?

14:29.736 --> 14:32.070
It's a she, right?
'Cause if it's a he,

14:32.072 --> 14:34.339
I'm sending you
to one of those camps.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.007
She's a new girl at school,

14:36.009 --> 14:38.109
and I'm super excited.

14:38.111 --> 14:42.046
You see, Dad,
it's not just superficial.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.748
I'm deep in love.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.315
How deep?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.351
You know how when I go
in the ball pit

14:46.353 --> 14:47.318
at Cheese E. Charley's

14:47.320 --> 14:49.654
and I sink all the way
down to the bottom

14:49.656 --> 14:51.489
and you can't find me?

14:51.491 --> 14:52.357

16:10.236 --> 16:12.403
Why don't you invite her
over for dinner?

16:12.405 --> 16:13.338
No!

16:13.340 --> 16:14.706
I mean, um,
girls don't like

16:14.708 --> 16:16.240
being pushed
into meeting parents.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.742
You're going
to scare her away.

16:17.744 --> 16:18.776
That's stupid.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.813
Teenage girls love
to be told what to do.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.548
"Come over here, sweetie.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.649
"Lose the top.

"Hmm, not bad.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.620
"Turn around.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.655
"Okay, now turn back around

16:30.657 --> 16:33.691
and show me how bad
you want to be a cheerleader."

16:33.693 --> 16:37.161
From the mouths of babes.

16:39.765 --> 16:40.765
Here she comes.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.300
Now, I didn't tell her
you'd be here

16:42.302 --> 16:45.103
because I didn't want her
to be nervous.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.505
Tyra, over here.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.578
Roberta.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.979
Oh, my God.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.180
(laughs)

16:56.182 --> 16:58.416
That is exceptional.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.119
Family, I want you
to meet Tyra.

17:01.121 --> 17:04.689
Tyra?!
That's a "Tyra-ble"
disguise.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.124
(laughs)

17:06.126 --> 17:09.093
Oh, Junior, what
have you done?

17:09.095 --> 17:11.029
I'm sorry
I tricked you, Tyra,

17:11.031 --> 17:13.564
but I really wanted
my family to meet you

17:13.566 --> 17:15.166
to prove
you were real--

17:15.168 --> 17:17.168
a real girl who likes me

17:17.170 --> 17:20.104
and not a prostitute
or a robot.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.205
W-Would you excuse me?

17:21.207 --> 17:22.273
I need to use the restroom.

17:22.275 --> 17:25.810
Yeah, I'll bet you do 'cause
you're so full of crap.

17:25.812 --> 17:29.480
And that's why I'm
dressed this way.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.181
A fat suit?!

17:30.183 --> 17:32.817
What the hell kind
of comedy high school

17:32.819 --> 17:34.452
are you going to, anyway?

17:34.454 --> 17:35.186
Hey, Tyra,

17:35.188 --> 17:36.521
see you at the game on Friday.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.789
What do I do, Cleveland?

17:37.791 --> 17:41.659
I don't want to hurt him, but I
have to go back to being myself.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.194
You got yourself
into this mess.

17:43.196 --> 17:46.464
You've got
to figure a way out.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.033
Fup-away!

17:50.869 --> 17:52.603
Oh, look
who it is.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.806
You come to gloat
about your success?

17:54.808 --> 17:56.741
Well, how about
you suck it instead?

17:56.743 --> 18:00.144
'Cause Shirtflix.com
is online, bitches.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.112
Check it out.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.147
Comes with its own
"shirt-a-lope."

18:03.149 --> 18:07.819
You mail it back, three days
later, whole new shirt.

18:07.821 --> 18:10.788
Cleveland, we, uh,
we wanted to apologize to you

18:10.790 --> 18:13.891
for, uh, you know,
kicking you out of the group

18:13.893 --> 18:16.027
like you were
some gay soldier.

18:16.029 --> 18:17.228
Uh, we also wanted
to tell you

18:17.230 --> 18:19.664
we're getting sued
for copyright infringement.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.499
What?
The Brew-Choo Train
already exists,

18:21.501 --> 18:23.901
except it's called
the Cider Glider.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.837
Awesome name.
Better than ours.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.638
That sounds kind
of familiar.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.107
ANNOUNCER:
It's time to say good-bye

18:29.109 --> 18:30.708
to the frustration
of not being able

18:30.710 --> 18:32.844
to slide your beverage
across a table

18:32.846 --> 18:35.480
because the Cider Glider
is here.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.214
Pssh!

18:36.216 --> 18:40.651
They should call that
the Roller Coaster.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.489
(inhales deeply)

18:44.491 --> 18:47.458
(exhales deeply)

18:47.460 --> 18:48.559
(smacks lips)

18:48.561 --> 18:51.062
Huh, I totally
forgot about that.

18:51.064 --> 18:53.164
Well, I guess I
lucked out, then, huh?

18:53.166 --> 18:54.532
Well, uh, not really.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.068
You see, we, we, uh,
we forgot to take your name

18:57.070 --> 18:59.504
off the paperwork as inventor,

18:59.506 --> 19:04.142
so, so what that means is you're
the only one getting sued,

19:04.144 --> 19:06.377
so, uh, so sorry about that.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.345
Stool later?

19:07.347 --> 19:08.479
You got served.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.814
I'm tired of you.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.816
(screams)

19:14.586 --> 19:15.720
Good morning, Tyra.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.188
I brought you a
flower for your hair

19:17.190 --> 19:18.656
to brighten up
your face a little.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.692
I'll work on myself, too,
but you got to do your part.

19:21.694 --> 19:25.396
Look, Junior...
I have some bad news.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.298
My family is moving
to Alaska.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.600
What? But you
just moved here.

19:29.602 --> 19:33.171
I know, but-- you got
to keep this a secret--

19:33.173 --> 19:35.673
my dad is Iron Man.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.941
Wow!

19:36.943 --> 19:38.643
But what about us?

19:38.645 --> 19:40.077
I'm really sorry, Junior.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.580
You know, I've gone
to a lot of schools,

19:42.582 --> 19:45.149
and I've never met
a boy as sweet as you.

19:45.151 --> 19:49.620
I've learned so much about
myself just being your friend.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.156
Thank you, Junior.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.894
Good-bye, Tyra.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.975
I got a postcard
from Tyra!

20:10.977 --> 20:13.277
"Dear Junior, how are you?

20:13.279 --> 20:15.179
"Alaska is very cold.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.347
"It is our 49th state.

20:16.349 --> 20:21.018
"Its main exports are fish,
energy, and crazy people.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.220
"Miss you bunches.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.955
"XOXO.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.489
Your friend, Tyra."

20:25.491 --> 20:26.757
Isn't she great?

20:26.759 --> 20:30.928
She's all right, Junior;
she's all right.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.097
I'm going to go upstairs
and try to start puberty.

20:33.099 --> 20:38.169
Uh-oh, I'd better go hide my
Niagara Falls pocket pooswa.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.371
It's a change purse,
Rallo.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.206
RALLO:
Tomato, tomah-to.

20:42.208 --> 20:46.811
And that's how Len Stein
settled my copyright lawsuit.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.646
I wish we could invent
something else.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.513
I got one.

20:49.515 --> 20:52.783
Last night I thought
of something called
the Alda-fier,

20:52.785 --> 20:55.853
a handheld device
that converts any voice

20:55.855 --> 21:00.091
into that of TV star Alan Alda.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.928
You got to lay off
the weed.
