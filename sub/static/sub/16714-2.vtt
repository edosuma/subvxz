[Screaming]

00:22.067 --> 00:23.551
Hey.

00:24.553 --> 00:26.086
Hey.

00:30.192 --> 00:31.487
You all right?

00:31.533 --> 00:32.866
Yeah.

00:33.681 --> 00:35.348
You sure?

00:36.784 --> 00:38.584
Oh, this?

00:38.586 --> 00:40.720
This hurts like hell, but, yeah, yeah,

00:40.722 --> 00:41.721
I'm good.

00:41.723 --> 00:42.923
You need anything?

00:43.449 --> 00:44.414
No. I'm ok.

00:44.416 --> 00:45.716
Water? Tea?

00:45.718 --> 00:48.452
I saw some microwave popcorn back there.

00:48.454 --> 00:52.289
Really, I'm... I'm fine.

00:54.176 --> 00:57.411
You don't look fine.

00:57.413 --> 00:59.079
You know, I've seen you look fine.

00:59.081 --> 01:01.248
That's not it.

01:01.759 --> 01:04.393
I know I'm the new guy and everything,

01:04.394 --> 01:06.329
but, uh, I'm here if you need me.

01:06.839 --> 01:10.073
Listen, I just... I just
need my own bed. That's all.

01:11.243 --> 01:12.443
All right.

01:12.445 --> 01:16.313
If you want to talk, I'm around.

01:19.885 --> 01:21.018
Hey, Luke.

01:21.020 --> 01:23.220
Um...

01:24.356 --> 01:26.590
Thank you...

01:26.592 --> 01:28.659
For what you did.

01:28.661 --> 01:31.628
You don't need to thank me.

01:31.630 --> 01:33.730
We're a team.

02:01.060 --> 02:04.828
[Water running]

02:18.978 --> 02:19.977
Will.

02:19.979 --> 02:21.778
Shh.

02:23.048 --> 02:25.582
[Whispering] Why is the shower running?

02:25.584 --> 02:28.719
Shh, shh, shh...

02:28.721 --> 02:31.421
It's ok.

02:31.423 --> 02:33.991
It's all right, bud.

02:33.993 --> 02:36.293
It's ok.

02:36.295 --> 02:38.629
It's ok.

02:38.631 --> 02:40.697
It's all right.

02:49.575 --> 02:53.110
Babe, it's 3:00 in the morning.

02:53.112 --> 02:54.978
What happened to your hand?

02:54.980 --> 02:57.314
What's going on? Why are you up?

02:57.316 --> 02:59.616
Michael's sick. He's got the croup.

02:59.618 --> 03:00.684
Oh, no.

03:00.686 --> 03:02.920
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

03:02.922 --> 03:04.121
Why didn't you call me?

03:04.123 --> 03:06.657
I've been pretty busy
with the both of them.

03:06.659 --> 03:07.791
Does Henry have it, too?

03:07.793 --> 03:09.660
No. No, not yet, anyway.

03:09.662 --> 03:12.129
Come on.

03:12.131 --> 03:13.530
Did you call the doctor?

03:13.532 --> 03:14.831
Of course I did.

03:14.833 --> 03:17.668
Well, what did he say?
Did he prescribe anything?

03:17.670 --> 03:21.071
Just steam showers, cool night
air, and watch his breathing.

03:21.073 --> 03:23.040
Some ibuprofen for
the fever and the pain.

03:23.042 --> 03:24.575
When did this happen?

03:24.577 --> 03:26.310
Well, he started going south last night,

03:26.312 --> 03:28.078
but tonight the cough's really bad.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.446
Babe, you should have told me.

03:29.448 --> 03:31.748
Why? So you could worry
while you were on a case?

03:31.750 --> 03:33.317
There's nothing you could have done.

03:33.319 --> 03:34.518
It doesn't matter. You
should have called me.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.752
You don't think I can handle it?

03:35.754 --> 03:36.853
I didn't say that.

03:36.855 --> 03:39.524
Then what are you saying?

03:40.526 --> 03:41.892
Hey, where you going? Forget it.

03:41.894 --> 03:43.193
To sit with him.

03:43.195 --> 03:45.429
The doctor said to watch
his breathing, right?

03:45.431 --> 03:47.564
The monitors are on.

03:47.566 --> 03:49.766
What's wrong?

03:51.303 --> 03:54.371
Nothing. I just... can I
please take care of my son?

03:54.373 --> 03:57.474
He's sleeping. Trust me, you
don't want to wake him up.

03:57.476 --> 04:02.045
JJ, come on, look at me.

04:02.047 --> 04:03.714
What is it?

04:03.716 --> 04:06.550
What's going on?

04:08.020 --> 04:09.853
You want to talk about it?

04:11.924 --> 04:14.191
Well, you know we have to, right?

04:14.193 --> 04:17.060
Remember what the Bureau therapist said.

04:17.062 --> 04:19.262
No holding it in, ever.

04:19.264 --> 04:21.898
We bring it home, we gotta get it out.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.810
It was kids, wasn't it?

04:34.913 --> 04:37.581
Yeah. Come here.

04:40.019 --> 04:41.885
Listen, I'm gonna go downstairs

04:41.887 --> 04:44.554
and put some coffee on so we can talk.

04:44.556 --> 04:46.590
Ok?

04:47.760 --> 04:49.426
You all right?

04:49.428 --> 04:50.560
Ok.

04:50.562 --> 04:53.530
Not gonna get much sleep tonight anyway.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.934
I'm glad you're back, babe.

05:04.410 --> 05:06.143
Jennifer!

05:06.145 --> 05:07.878
Help me!

05:07.880 --> 05:10.981
Please, Jennifer, help me!

05:10.983 --> 05:16.720
Jennifer! Help me, please!

05:16.722 --> 05:19.156
Please help me!

How's that hand?

06:14.266 --> 06:16.383
Kills.

06:16.385 --> 06:20.387
What'd you do to it?

06:20.389 --> 06:22.055
Burned it.

06:51.768 --> 06:54.018
You want me to sit there?

06:59.693 --> 07:01.826
[Sighs]

07:02.986 --> 07:05.920
[Exhales]

07:05.922 --> 07:09.474
Well, we were on our
way back from Seattle.

07:09.476 --> 07:12.493
Right. The spree killer
with the assault rifle.

07:12.495 --> 07:13.861
Yeah.

07:13.863 --> 07:16.715
That's when we got the call.

07:19.753 --> 07:21.786
Alvez: Hey, we turned.
Why are we turning.

07:21.788 --> 07:25.256
Because we're not going home yet.

07:25.258 --> 07:27.091
This morning in Los Angeles

07:27.093 --> 07:28.926
the bodies of two children were found

07:28.928 --> 07:31.763
in an abandoned building
that burned down.

07:31.765 --> 07:34.682
Are these the missing kids
that Hotch is consulting on?

07:34.684 --> 07:37.185
No positive I.Ds, but
that's what he's thinking.

07:37.187 --> 07:38.386
Garcia, are you ready?

07:38.388 --> 07:39.721
Born that way, sir.

07:39.723 --> 07:41.272
Ok, this is the horrible part of my job

07:41.274 --> 07:43.391
where I stream this
sadness to your tablets.

07:43.393 --> 07:46.477
14-year-old Hannah Robertson
disappeared 5 days ago

07:46.479 --> 07:47.945
from Irvine, California.

07:47.947 --> 07:51.949
That little guy is
11-year-old Max Wasserman.

07:51.951 --> 07:54.485
He disappeared from Anaheim,
California, yesterday.

07:54.487 --> 07:56.738
Hannah was last seen
on her way to school,

07:56.740 --> 08:00.074
and Max was on his way
home from taekwondo class.

08:00.076 --> 08:02.460
Both kids were abducted
in broad daylight

08:02.462 --> 08:04.879
in low-risk neighborhoods,
this guy's got skills.

08:04.881 --> 08:07.465
You know, I'd bet he's
using some kind of a ruse

08:07.467 --> 08:08.966
so that way he can hide in plain sight.

08:08.968 --> 08:11.836
A blitz attack would be
faster and intimidating.

08:11.838 --> 08:13.921
He would need that to establish control.

08:13.923 --> 08:15.423
Either way, he's patient and organized.

08:15.425 --> 08:16.724
He probably stalked them

08:16.726 --> 08:18.242
and learned their daily routines.

08:18.244 --> 08:20.628
Wait, Garcia. Two years ago, San Diego.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.346
Yeah, way ahead of you, brainiac.

08:22.348 --> 08:24.165
Lisa Ruiz and James Jefferson.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.100
Both runaways and foster kids

08:26.102 --> 08:27.769
with police records,
uh, but their bodies

08:27.771 --> 08:29.153
were discovered several months apart.

08:29.155 --> 08:31.189
He crosses race lines
and those kids were older,

08:31.191 --> 08:32.823
but the M.O. is the same.

08:32.826 --> 08:34.976
A boy, a girl, and they were
all found burned to death

08:34.977 --> 08:36.193
in abandoned buildings.

08:36.196 --> 08:38.162
But these latest victims
were burned together,

08:38.164 --> 08:39.280
so why the change?

08:39.282 --> 08:41.499
He might need two kids at the same time

08:41.501 --> 08:42.667
to do his thing.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.118
I'm curious about the fire.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.620
It could be a forensic countermeasure,

08:45.622 --> 08:47.171
but the consistency
from victim to victim

08:47.173 --> 08:48.840
point so some kind of
compulsion based ritual,

08:48.842 --> 08:52.126
and since pyromaniacal urges
usually emerge in early adolescence,

08:52.128 --> 08:54.545
it probably has something
to do with his childhood.

08:54.547 --> 08:58.099
How can we even be sure
this is all the same guy?

08:58.101 --> 08:59.600
So what did you think?

08:59.602 --> 09:01.469
Definitely the same guy.

09:01.471 --> 09:02.637
Why?

09:02.639 --> 09:05.356
M.O's too similar.
Geography was too close.

09:05.358 --> 09:09.894
And when we got to the
crime scene, we knew.

09:09.896 --> 09:12.947
Reid: He used the same
type of lock and chain

09:12.949 --> 09:14.615
to restrain the victims in San Diego.

09:14.617 --> 09:16.951
He also used cots like this.

09:16.953 --> 09:19.871
The wood, too. It's like a funeral pyre.

09:19.873 --> 09:22.990
The guy goes from runaways to
good kids from good neighborhoods.

09:22.992 --> 09:25.710
That's a lot more work and
a lot more risk for him.

09:25.712 --> 09:28.379
So what was so special about these two?

09:28.381 --> 09:29.881
Why did he want them so bad?

09:29.883 --> 09:33.501
He may be discovering what his
true victim selection criterion is.

09:33.503 --> 09:36.053
Well, the runaways were
probably just a practice run...

09:36.055 --> 09:38.139
Easy targets, no one
reports them missing.

09:38.141 --> 09:40.007
But the boy/girl
pattern he's established

09:40.009 --> 09:43.144
suggests that there might be some
kind of fantasy he's trying to perfect.

09:43.146 --> 09:44.812
So what's the fantasy, then?

09:44.814 --> 09:46.597
Is he righting some kind of wrong?

09:46.599 --> 09:48.015
Getting revenge, maybe?

09:48.017 --> 09:50.651
If he has kids of his own, it might
have something to do with them.

09:50.653 --> 09:53.654
I can't imagine what would drive
a parent to do something like this.

09:53.656 --> 09:55.106
If he's mentally or
chemically imbalanced,

09:55.108 --> 09:59.110
a tragic life-altering event
could have been the trigger.

09:59.112 --> 10:00.695
Pyros like to watch, right?

10:00.697 --> 10:04.115
Yeah, they do. It's an inextricable
component of the compulsion.

10:04.117 --> 10:07.618
Look. Look at the
position of these cots.

10:07.620 --> 10:09.787
The kids could see each other
while this was happening.

10:09.789 --> 10:12.757
Psychological torture. And the
unsub probably watched as well,

10:12.759 --> 10:15.343
until at a certain point the
fire took over and he had to go.

10:15.345 --> 10:17.795
But he needs both kids to make it work.

10:17.797 --> 10:20.882
He took Hannah Robertson 4
days before Max Wasserman.

10:20.884 --> 10:23.885
That means he held her
someplace and kept her alive.

10:23.887 --> 10:26.053
Yeah. As soon as he got Max
he couldn't wait any longer.

10:26.055 --> 10:27.805
He planned everything.

10:27.807 --> 10:31.726
He probably stalked them until he
found the perfect place to set his fire.

10:31.728 --> 10:33.778
That would explain the
two-year dormancy period.

10:33.780 --> 10:36.914
Who he burns is just as
important as the fire itself.

10:36.916 --> 10:40.318
Alvez: I hate to think what he
did to her while he held her here.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.704
You get anything from the coroner?

10:43.706 --> 10:48.826
Um, Max Wasserman's body
was virtually incinerated,

10:48.828 --> 10:51.495
but, um, I guess the
fire department arrived

10:51.497 --> 10:56.667
before Hannah Robertson's
body was completely destroyed.

10:56.669 --> 11:00.004
Rossi: Hannah Robertson
had several burn wounds

11:00.006 --> 11:01.639
that were a few days old.

11:01.641 --> 11:04.008
Lewis: He couldn't resist
burning her while he held her.

11:04.010 --> 11:05.676
Hotch: Any sign of sexual assault?

11:05.678 --> 11:08.596
Inconclusive, but she did have a, uh,

11:08.598 --> 11:11.399
broken orbital bone
around her right eye,

11:11.401 --> 11:12.767
like she got punched.

11:12.769 --> 11:14.485
Hotch: What about the other child?

11:14.487 --> 11:17.271
Rossi: Too much damage.
But they did find traces

11:17.273 --> 11:19.523
of lighter fluid on both
of them. A lot of it.

11:19.525 --> 11:22.743
M.E. seems to think the
boy was lit on fire first.

11:22.745 --> 11:24.862
Yeah, that tracks with what
the fire department said,

11:24.864 --> 11:27.031
that the boy was the flash point.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.166
Well, it could be he was
trying to prolong his pleasure

11:29.168 --> 11:30.618
by burning them one at a time.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.703
It's more than about just watching.

11:32.705 --> 11:35.089
He wants them to suffer
physically and mentally.

11:35.091 --> 11:36.507
It's important to him.

11:36.509 --> 11:38.459
Both of these kids were brunette.

11:38.461 --> 11:41.095
If this is about perfecting a fantasy,

11:41.097 --> 11:43.097
they're probably
surrogates for somebody.

11:43.099 --> 11:45.883
Yeah. But who?

11:45.885 --> 11:49.520
So did you get an exact cause of death?

11:49.522 --> 11:53.858
Um, based on the amount
of smoke inhalation,

11:53.860 --> 11:57.061
we knew that he burned those kids alive.

11:57.063 --> 12:00.114
All 4 of them.

12:01.150 --> 12:02.450
You know what?

12:02.452 --> 12:04.535
Uh, can... can we please
do this in the morning?

12:04.537 --> 12:05.486
I'm really tired.

12:05.488 --> 12:07.154
JJ...

12:07.156 --> 12:08.456
I'm exhausted.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.741
You cannot go to sleep
with this in your head.

12:10.743 --> 12:12.410
It's not healthy.

12:12.412 --> 12:14.962
You've gotta get it out.

12:16.499 --> 12:18.466
You have to.

12:20.086 --> 12:22.053
And I just had two cups of coffee,

12:22.055 --> 12:24.972
so neither one of us is gonna sleep.

12:27.393 --> 12:30.678
Come on.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.680
Come on.

12:53.586 --> 12:56.504
Well, um...

12:56.506 --> 12:58.672
We did what we always do.

12:58.674 --> 13:01.292
We coordinated with local police

13:01.294 --> 13:03.711
to canvass every part of the area.

13:03.713 --> 13:06.430
We covered every angle
of our victimology

13:06.432 --> 13:08.883
by interviewing family
members and friends.

13:08.885 --> 13:11.936
We looked everywhere for a
connection between these victims,

13:11.938 --> 13:14.105
but there... There was nothing.

13:14.107 --> 13:18.109
So we issued a statement to
the press to alert the public.

13:18.111 --> 13:20.895
We were hoping that someone
out there knew something.

13:20.897 --> 13:23.981
We had no leads, so
anything would have helped.

13:23.983 --> 13:27.151
The forensic teams were stumped
because of all the fire damage.

13:27.153 --> 13:30.571
Our profile was developing,
but the guy was in the wind.

13:30.573 --> 13:35.743
A couple days went by, and to
tell you the truth, I lost hope.

13:35.745 --> 13:37.962
A guy like that might get quiet

13:37.964 --> 13:40.331
because he knows we're getting close.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.833
But he wouldn't be able
to contain his urges,

13:42.835 --> 13:45.336
not for long.

14:04.607 --> 14:05.940
But...

14:05.942 --> 14:07.241
The case cooled off.

14:07.243 --> 14:10.077
And we all thought
he went dormant again,

14:10.079 --> 14:13.998
he needed time to plan his next kills.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.966
But we were wrong.

14:15.968 --> 14:17.868
[Song playing]

14:23.426 --> 14:25.626
Excuse me.

14:25.628 --> 14:27.461
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

14:27.463 --> 14:28.679
What?

14:28.681 --> 14:29.680
I didn't mean to scare you.

14:29.682 --> 14:31.632
I just thought maybe you could help me.

14:31.634 --> 14:33.934
My daughter told me to get
this app called Snaptalk,

14:33.936 --> 14:35.636
but I can't find it anywhere.

14:35.638 --> 14:37.605
I'm terrible with this thing.

14:37.607 --> 14:38.606
Snapchat.

14:38.608 --> 14:39.807
What?

14:39.809 --> 14:41.358
It's Snapchat, not Snaptalk.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.527
You're kidding. That would explain it.

14:43.529 --> 14:46.447
And why can't I find it?

14:46.449 --> 14:48.732
See? I told you, I'm terrible.

14:48.734 --> 14:51.285
My little girl always
gives me a hard time.

14:51.287 --> 14:52.453
She's a lot younger than you are.

14:52.455 --> 14:54.405
What are you, 17?

14:54.407 --> 14:55.456
16.

14:55.458 --> 14:56.657
Ooh. [Chuckles]

14:56.659 --> 14:57.825
Driving.

14:57.827 --> 14:59.076
You know what?

14:59.078 --> 15:00.411
Would you mind just...

15:00.413 --> 15:03.664
My daughter, she always
just does it for me.

15:03.666 --> 15:05.916
I'm sorry, I'm late for school.

15:05.918 --> 15:07.301
Oh, it's ok.

15:07.303 --> 15:08.669
No problem, sorry.

15:08.671 --> 15:10.504
You have a good day.

15:18.181 --> 15:19.763
16 years old.

15:19.765 --> 15:22.516
Broad daylight. No witnesses.

15:22.518 --> 15:23.851
Nothing.

15:23.853 --> 15:26.187
Now, I'll never understand
how that happens.

15:26.189 --> 15:29.740
It's a huge city. I mean,
everyone's on there camera phones

15:29.742 --> 15:33.360
and no one sees a
16-year-old girl go missing?

15:33.362 --> 15:35.279
It happens, babe.

15:35.281 --> 15:37.248
[Michael coughing]

15:42.338 --> 15:43.837
Jennifer!

15:43.839 --> 15:46.006
I gotta go...

15:46.008 --> 15:47.341
Just sit down. Just relax.

15:47.343 --> 15:50.511
Will! Will, let me
go look after him, ok?

15:50.513 --> 15:52.930
All right.

15:52.932 --> 15:57.384
[Michael crying, coughing]

15:59.222 --> 16:03.691
JJ: It's ok. It's ok. Mama's here.

16:04.777 --> 16:07.278
I love you.

16:16.705 --> 16:18.806
He still has a fever.

16:18.828 --> 16:20.261
[Exhales]

16:20.263 --> 16:23.814
Well, we can give him some
more medicine in a couple hours.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.350
That cough, though.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.152
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.653
The first time he barked like that,

16:29.655 --> 16:32.873
I thought we were headed to the E.R.

16:37.797 --> 16:38.796
I'm sorry.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.132
About what?

16:41.134 --> 16:44.769
Snapping at you.

16:44.771 --> 16:48.022
I know it's hard when I'm not here.

16:49.859 --> 16:52.476
And it's probably harder when I am here.

16:52.478 --> 16:53.644
[Both laugh]

16:53.646 --> 16:55.980
Ohh...

16:57.483 --> 16:59.483
I love you, too.

16:59.485 --> 17:02.319
So what happened next?

17:02.321 --> 17:05.740
Assuming you all issued an Amber alert.

17:05.742 --> 17:07.540
Mm, yeah. Right away.

17:07.542 --> 17:09.326
And what was your profile?

17:09.328 --> 17:11.829
Uh, he was accelerating,

17:11.830 --> 17:13.164
getting confident and bold.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.750
And based on the victimology
and the physical effort

17:15.752 --> 17:17.835
it would take to execute his M.O.,

17:17.837 --> 17:21.472
we thought it was a white
man between 25 and 35.

17:21.473 --> 17:24.340
We are referring to him
as a sadistic pyromaniac,

17:24.343 --> 17:26.227
which is a rare and
dangerous combination

17:26.229 --> 17:29.013
because there's a strong compulsive
element to his psychopathy.

17:29.015 --> 17:32.483
It's not just about
watching the fires he sets.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.186
It's also the mental pain
and anguish he inflicts.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.155
We believe that he's driving
a truck, van, or an RV.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.991
He needs space to abduct
and transport his victims.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.693
We know that he's extremely mobile.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.995
We've notified law enforcement
in surrounding counties.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.031
We just want to make sure he
doesn't leave the city limits.

17:47.033 --> 17:51.035
JJ: We've scoured CODIS, as well as
the list of arson arrests in the area

17:51.037 --> 17:53.954
and there's nothing. So our guy
probably hasn't let his fire habit

17:53.956 --> 17:55.172
get him in trouble.

17:55.174 --> 17:57.124
Alvez: He's smart
enough not to get caught.

17:57.126 --> 17:58.926
And with intelligence
come social skills.

17:58.928 --> 18:01.796
So, odds are he comes
off like a nice guy.

18:01.798 --> 18:04.014
And he's well adjusted enough
to hold down a steady job,

18:04.016 --> 18:06.433
but it is highly likely
he's sublimating his desires

18:06.435 --> 18:08.185
through his chosen line of work.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.687
Reid: He could be a firefighter.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.305
He might work in a crematorium.

18:11.307 --> 18:13.774
Even being a cook in a kitchen
could satiate his urges.

18:13.776 --> 18:16.277
He would want to be
anyplace near open flames.

18:16.279 --> 18:17.862
Alvez: It's a very specific M.O.

18:17.864 --> 18:21.232
And that consistency and behavior
means that it's need-based.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.200
So he will stick to his pattern.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.986
The bad news is he's already
picked his next victim,

18:25.988 --> 18:27.288
an adolescent boy.

18:27.290 --> 18:30.124
But the good news is, Francesca Morales

18:30.126 --> 18:31.625
is probably still alive.

18:31.627 --> 18:33.160
So time is of the essence.

18:33.162 --> 18:35.162
He's moving fast, we
need to move faster.

18:35.164 --> 18:37.248
Thank you.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.968
We had the LAPD double their patrols.

18:40.970 --> 18:42.753
The fire department was on high alert,

18:42.755 --> 18:44.305
but this guy moved around a lot,

18:44.307 --> 18:47.174
all over Southern California,
and he could have been anywhere.

18:47.176 --> 18:51.896
So, in the meantime,
we talked to the family.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.348
You know, it's funny.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.100
I used to do that all the time,

18:56.102 --> 18:57.434
you know, talk to the families.

18:57.436 --> 19:00.187
But ever since we had kids,

19:00.189 --> 19:04.742
the worst part of the job, hands down.

19:04.744 --> 19:08.078
Actually, I used to think
I was helping those people.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.314
You are helping those people.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.617
Her name is Renee.

Single mom,

19:15.454 --> 19:17.621
registered nurse.

19:17.623 --> 19:22.009
Her husband Tony was killed
in Afghanistan 6 years ago.

19:22.011 --> 19:25.796
Did Francesca walk to school
the same way every day?

19:25.798 --> 19:27.965
Yeah. With her brother.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.667
But he was sick today.

19:29.669 --> 19:33.938
I thought she'd be fine.
She had her cell phone.

19:33.940 --> 19:37.725
She's 16, you know?

19:37.727 --> 19:39.977
I should've went with her.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.646
Hey. I know this is a lot,

19:42.648 --> 19:44.231
but you cannot blame yourself.

19:44.233 --> 19:45.783
Why did this happen?

19:45.785 --> 19:49.653
Mrs. Morales, we believe this man
appears as very non-threatening.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.322
So it's possible he could have just...

19:51.324 --> 19:54.291
No. No, she just wouldn't
go off with somebody.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.493
She knows better than that.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.245
We talked about that.

19:58.247 --> 20:00.214
So we knew if he tried
to use a ruse on her,

20:00.216 --> 20:01.749
it wouldn't work on this girl.

20:01.751 --> 20:04.251
So he probably resorted to
some kind of blitz attack.

20:04.253 --> 20:06.470
The compulsion was too strong.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.088
And once he saw her,

20:08.090 --> 20:11.375
he would have needed to take her.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.093
But...

20:13.095 --> 20:15.930
Now, how do you explain
that to a parent?

20:15.932 --> 20:18.682
Do you even have kids?

20:18.684 --> 20:21.185
Yeah.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.687
Yeah, I have two boys.

20:26.108 --> 20:27.691
She's a working mom.

20:27.693 --> 20:30.027
She's trying to do her best.

20:30.029 --> 20:33.697
She was like anybody, you know?

20:33.699 --> 20:37.918
Just like anybody or just like you?

20:42.208 --> 20:45.542
I just kept wondering

20:45.544 --> 20:49.213
how... how she's doing it all alone.

20:52.218 --> 20:56.470
I don't know what I'd do without you.

20:57.556 --> 21:01.642
And that wasn't even the hardest part.

21:01.644 --> 21:05.446

23:47.538 --> 23:49.288
I don't think he'll leave the city.

23:49.290 --> 23:51.674
Look, if you track his
activity from the start,

23:51.676 --> 23:54.209
his first two victims were
found near the Mexican border.

23:54.211 --> 23:57.546
But they were discovered 6 months
apart and in locations 52 miles apart.

23:57.548 --> 23:59.381
Unfortunately, because
they were runaways,

23:59.383 --> 24:01.350
it's impossible to track
when or where they were taken,

24:01.352 --> 24:04.386
but his next two victims, Hannah
Robertson and Max Wasserman,

24:04.388 --> 24:07.640
only lived 14 miles apart, and they
were taken within days of each other.

24:07.642 --> 24:08.607
Ok.

24:08.609 --> 24:10.109
But he took them both 39 miles

24:10.111 --> 24:13.112
all the way here to Los
Angeles to finish the job.

24:13.114 --> 24:15.481
We profiled that that
could be about availability.

24:15.483 --> 24:16.782
A lot of abandoned space here.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.431
And a high police presence
around the abduction sites.

24:19.433 --> 24:21.966
Maybe it makes sense he'd keep
moving to avoid being caught.

24:21.968 --> 24:24.102
But he didn't keep moving,
and he didn't go dormant.

24:24.182 --> 24:26.115
He stayed right here and accelerated.

24:26.117 --> 24:28.051
Los Angeles is where he wants to be.

24:28.053 --> 24:30.720
I think he's been
converging on the city.

24:30.722 --> 24:32.455
If that's true, his next victim

24:32.457 --> 24:34.657
probably lives in Los Angeles, too.

24:34.659 --> 24:35.859
Sir, yes, sir.

24:35.861 --> 24:37.894
Garcia, how many boys live
within a 15-mile radius

24:37.896 --> 24:38.896
of Francesca Morales?

24:38.930 --> 24:41.698
Uh, thousands, Sir, like literally.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.633
All right, narrow your
search by hair color.

24:43.635 --> 24:45.435
We're only interested
in boys with brown hair.

24:45.470 --> 24:47.871
Right. Uh, this is gonna take me a while

24:47.921 --> 24:49.988
because kids that age don't
usually have photo I.Ds.

24:49.990 --> 24:52.290
They have passports, maybe, but it's
all about the parents' social media.

24:52.292 --> 24:54.492
I'm gonna handle this. I'll hit
you back when I have something.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.627
All right, thanks.

24:55.629 --> 24:56.161
Wait a second.

24:56.225 --> 24:57.658
Francesca Morales has
a brother that age.

24:57.660 --> 25:01.095
If the unsub is converging,
he could be a target.

25:01.711 --> 25:04.144
Yeah, but Hannah Robertson
had an 11-year-old brother

25:04.146 --> 25:07.548
and a 9-year-old brother, and Max
Wasserman has a 15-year-old sister.

25:07.550 --> 25:08.982
That could be why he picked them.

25:08.984 --> 25:10.451
They had siblings the right age.

25:10.453 --> 25:12.386
So then why didn't he
take the other siblings?

25:12.388 --> 25:14.621
Who knows? Confidence, opportunity.

25:14.623 --> 25:16.156
Maybe he just wasn't ready.

25:16.158 --> 25:19.626
Maybe the pattern isn't
about older girl, younger boy.

25:19.628 --> 25:21.929
It's about older
sister, younger brother.

25:21.931 --> 25:23.997
We should bring in this
Morales kid just to be safe.

25:23.999 --> 25:25.966
JJ and Alvez are there now.

25:25.968 --> 25:27.201
[Ring]

25:27.203 --> 25:28.569
Yeah, Hotch.

25:28.571 --> 25:30.471
We think the Morales
boy might be a target.

25:30.473 --> 25:33.674
It would be a good idea to bring him
and his mother in as a precaution.

25:33.676 --> 25:35.242
We just left about 10 minutes ago.

25:35.244 --> 25:36.677
All right, we'll head back,

25:36.679 --> 25:38.879
but LAPD was just
finishing up when we left.

25:45.121 --> 25:47.588
[Sirens]

25:48.850 --> 25:52.051
Those are the same cops
that were at the house.

26:07.071 --> 26:08.838
He lit a car on fire nearby.

26:09.344 --> 26:11.695
He used it as a diversion to get
those cops away from the house.

26:11.697 --> 26:14.931
Which means he was probably
watching while we were there,

26:14.933 --> 26:17.767
and he just waited for us to leave.

26:17.769 --> 26:19.102
Renee?

26:19.104 --> 26:20.103
Berto?

26:20.105 --> 26:22.138
It's Jennifer with the FBI.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.241
Hello?

26:39.743 --> 26:41.175
Luke!

26:44.428 --> 26:45.761
She's still alive.

26:45.763 --> 26:46.862
All right, I'll call it in.

26:47.058 --> 26:48.692
House is clear, but Berto's not here.

26:48.706 --> 26:50.038
Damn it.

26:56.594 --> 26:59.745
Wow, I was hungrier than I thought.

26:59.747 --> 27:01.847
When was the last time you ate?

27:01.849 --> 27:02.982
I don't know.

27:02.984 --> 27:04.967
Uh, this morning?

27:04.969 --> 27:08.170
[Laughs] You mean yesterday morning?

27:08.172 --> 27:09.672
Do you want some more?

27:09.674 --> 27:12.808
Um, no, thank you.

27:12.810 --> 27:16.479
I don't... I don't understand
why your eggs are so good.

27:16.481 --> 27:18.230
I still can't make 'em like that.

27:18.232 --> 27:20.816
I told you, it's the butter.

27:20.818 --> 27:21.817
Mm.

27:21.819 --> 27:22.852
Yeah.

27:22.854 --> 27:24.487
[Imitating him] It's the butter.

27:24.489 --> 27:25.988
It is the butter.

27:30.995 --> 27:33.779
Oh, man.

27:34.040 --> 27:38.037
Remember when we used to have
breakfast like this all the time?

27:38.038 --> 27:39.868
- Yeah.
- Just you and me.

27:39.870 --> 27:41.202
A long time ago.

27:41.204 --> 27:43.455
[Chuckles]

27:44.661 --> 27:47.612
You know, he keeps asking for you.

27:47.614 --> 27:51.499
He keeps asking for my phone
so he can look at pictures.

27:52.865 --> 27:54.903
I miss so much.

27:57.323 --> 27:59.456
It goes... it goes so fast.

27:59.458 --> 28:01.491
I know.

28:01.493 --> 28:04.411
Yeah. But you and me both know

28:04.413 --> 28:06.997
you won't be happy
unless you're on the job.

28:07.559 --> 28:10.860
Neither of us would.

28:19.627 --> 28:22.961
You stay here and let me have this.

28:22.963 --> 28:24.163
All right?

28:24.165 --> 28:25.881
Yes, sir.

28:28.002 --> 28:31.637
So I'm assuming that you all issued

28:31.639 --> 28:33.756
another Amber alert.

28:33.758 --> 28:35.841
Renee Morales got a severe concussion,

28:35.843 --> 28:37.343
but she's gonna be fine.

28:37.345 --> 28:38.894
I'm surprised he didn't kill her.

28:38.896 --> 28:39.978
He didn't want her.

28:39.980 --> 28:41.480
Was she able to give a description?

28:41.482 --> 28:44.400
Not much of one. White
guy, about 6 feet tall.

28:44.402 --> 28:45.317
That's about it.

28:45.319 --> 28:47.436
Well, that narrows the search.

28:47.438 --> 28:51.190
LAPD's increased patrols in
low income and industrial areas,

28:51.192 --> 28:53.492
places where's he's likely
to find the space he needs.

28:53.494 --> 28:54.993
Well, he's been planning
this for a while.

28:54.995 --> 28:57.196
Right now he's got an
actual brother/sister pair.

28:57.198 --> 28:58.580
He won't be able to wait long.

28:58.582 --> 29:00.332
But if siblings are the key here,

29:00.334 --> 29:01.750
then what did we miss?

29:01.752 --> 29:04.119
Odds are this whole thing
is about his siblings.

29:04.121 --> 29:05.921
If he wants to be in Los Angeles,

29:05.923 --> 29:07.423
that means he must have an end game.

29:07.425 --> 29:10.426
Yeah, and if he does, then
he may escalate somehow

29:10.428 --> 29:13.128
and perfect that fantasy,
light a bigger fire.

29:13.130 --> 29:15.547
We should take another look
at our arson lists in the area,

29:15.549 --> 29:17.266
see if any have brothers and sisters.

29:17.268 --> 29:19.218
Garcia: Ready, willing,
and excellent, Sir.

29:19.220 --> 29:22.271
Garcia, our lists of arson arrests
and convictions in California.

29:22.273 --> 29:24.473
Ok. Those are mostly men.

29:24.475 --> 29:25.941
They are all men.

29:25.943 --> 29:27.609
BTW, bad boys that play with fire.

29:27.611 --> 29:29.311
How many of them have siblings?

29:29.313 --> 29:31.113
A lot of names. I'm
gonna get jiggy with it

29:31.115 --> 29:33.282
and give you lots of those. 166.

29:33.284 --> 29:36.118
We profiled that he might
sublimate his desires with work.

29:36.120 --> 29:39.905
Do any of them have jobs in
any fire-related businesses?

29:39.907 --> 29:42.241
Ok. Hold on. Searching.

29:42.243 --> 29:43.492
One name.

29:43.494 --> 29:44.660
Two names.

29:44.662 --> 29:45.994
Still searching.

29:45.996 --> 29:49.581
Why does the last 10%
always take so flippin' long?

29:49.583 --> 29:50.582
There we go... 3 names.

29:50.584 --> 29:51.834
Hotch: All right, go ahead.

29:51.836 --> 29:53.218
First up is John Bryant.

29:53.220 --> 29:55.421
He's a firefighter in San Diego.

29:55.423 --> 29:57.339
Definitely not our unsub,
'cause according to Facebook

29:57.341 --> 29:58.974
he's been in Hawaii for the last week

29:58.976 --> 30:00.592
with his wife and adorable kids.

30:00.594 --> 30:01.677
And who else?

30:01.679 --> 30:03.679
Next up we have Steve Addison.

30:03.681 --> 30:07.065
He's a sales exec at Wing-Ho
Fireworks in Riverside.

30:07.067 --> 30:10.102
Definitely not it because he's
been in Shanghai for the last month.

30:10.104 --> 30:13.272
And lastly we have Rudy
Sheffield, certainly not our unsub

30:13.274 --> 30:17.443
because he is serving two years in
Chino state prison on drug charges.

30:17.445 --> 30:20.579
All right, expand your
search to neighboring states.

30:20.581 --> 30:23.582
Ok. Arizona, Nevada, Oregon.

30:23.584 --> 30:27.369
36 names and I've cross-checked those

30:27.371 --> 30:29.087
with guys who have siblings

30:29.089 --> 30:32.257
and work in fire-related occupations.

30:32.259 --> 30:33.258
And we've got...

30:33.260 --> 30:34.359
Hello.

30:34.361 --> 30:37.763
John David Bates, resident of Nevada,

30:37.765 --> 30:39.631
currently renting an
apartment in Los Angeles.

30:39.633 --> 30:40.849
What's he doing here?

30:40.851 --> 30:43.352
Uh, he works for smoke-out
repair and construction.

30:43.354 --> 30:45.304
They fix fire damage,
board up windows and stuff.

30:45.369 --> 30:47.052
What was he arrested for?

30:47.054 --> 30:50.288
Whoa. When he was 12, he
set fire to the family house

30:50.290 --> 30:51.840
with his 14-year-old
sister locked inside of it.

30:51.909 --> 30:52.991
Did it work?

30:52.993 --> 30:55.327
No. But he's a tenacious little bugger

30:55.329 --> 30:57.629
and two years later he
tried to do it again.

30:57.631 --> 30:59.248
Also did not work, but at that time,

30:59.250 --> 31:01.133
his parents relinquished custody

31:01.135 --> 31:03.919
and he was rehomed, and
then went into juvey,

31:03.921 --> 31:05.471
and eventually the foster care system.

31:05.473 --> 31:07.589
That could be the fantasy
he's trying to live out,

31:07.591 --> 31:09.091
burning his sister alive.

31:09.093 --> 31:10.259
Then why does he need the boy, too?

31:10.261 --> 31:12.594
Self-loathing. The boy's
a surrogate for him.

31:12.596 --> 31:15.514
His parents gave him up. It
devastated him and he's lashing out.

31:15.621 --> 31:16.904
And where's the sister now?

31:16.906 --> 31:19.673
Ok. Trisha Bates currently resides in...

31:19.675 --> 31:20.991
Los Angeles.

31:20.993 --> 31:22.493
That's why he came to Los Angeles.

31:22.495 --> 31:24.161
His end game is her.

31:24.163 --> 31:25.379
Are they in touch?

31:25.381 --> 31:26.964
Uh-uh. Looks like he was doing work

31:26.966 --> 31:28.749
in San Diego two years ago,

31:28.751 --> 31:31.669
somehow found her email
address and tried to reconnect.

31:31.671 --> 31:33.754
Two years ago? That's when
the first murders took place.

31:33.756 --> 31:35.222
Garcia, did she respond to the email?

31:35.224 --> 31:38.475
Yeah. She basically told him
to go have sex with himself

31:38.477 --> 31:40.928
and then she deleted that email account.

31:40.930 --> 31:43.180
That rejection was probably his trigger.

31:43.182 --> 31:44.932
We should go pick her up.

31:44.934 --> 31:46.400
Garcia, we need addresses
for Bates and the sister.

31:46.402 --> 31:48.018
Of course. Sent, sent, and sent.

31:49.605 --> 31:52.273
[Heavy metal song playing]

31:52.275 --> 31:55.492
[Turns up volume]

32:45.161 --> 32:48.662
What? Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

32:48.664 --> 32:50.130
[Ring]

32:50.132 --> 32:51.498
What's up, Garcia?

32:51.500 --> 32:53.767
I got a pong to my ping on
Roberto Morales' cell phone.

32:53.769 --> 32:55.085
I called you guys 'cause you're closer.

32:55.087 --> 32:57.137
All right, send us the
address and notify LAPD.

32:57.139 --> 32:59.006
I already sent it. I'll let Hotch know.

33:00.309 --> 33:01.892
No, no, no, no, no, no.

33:01.894 --> 33:04.946
Go. Wait, go, come on.

33:11.129 --> 33:13.648
Wait till you see this.

33:14.885 --> 33:17.302
No! Stop it! No!

33:17.304 --> 33:18.487
Please stop!

33:47.867 --> 33:49.134
Help me, please!

33:50.140 --> 33:52.891
No, no! Please!

33:55.560 --> 33:57.610
JJ, wait!

34:05.235 --> 34:06.785
They were alive?

34:10.016 --> 34:12.850
And you ran in there, didn't you?

34:20.382 --> 34:21.581
You look mad.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.382
I'm not mad.

34:24.132 --> 34:28.217
I didn't think. I just reacted.

34:28.219 --> 34:30.002
I know. It's ok.

34:30.004 --> 34:31.420
I'd have done the same thing

34:31.422 --> 34:34.639
if there were kids trapped
in a burning building.

34:37.393 --> 34:41.396
Don't mean I have to like hearing
about you doing it, though.

34:41.398 --> 34:44.399
So I guess that's how
you hurt yourself, huh?

34:44.400 --> 34:45.949
Going in there?

34:45.952 --> 34:49.320
Yeah. But that happened later.

34:49.322 --> 34:50.656
Help us, please!

34:50.991 --> 34:53.274
Please, please, someone come.

34:53.275 --> 34:56.360
JJ: When we got there we
could hear the kids screaming.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.279
Johnny!

34:58.281 --> 35:00.532
But then we heard this other voice.

35:00.534 --> 35:02.701
Another voice? Who else was in there?

35:02.703 --> 35:03.752
Trisha Bates.

35:03.754 --> 35:05.420
The unsub's sister.

35:05.422 --> 35:08.006
Johnny, don't! Please don't do this!

35:08.008 --> 35:09.007
Ohh!

35:09.009 --> 35:10.759
Johnny!

35:10.761 --> 35:13.128
Don't do it! FBI!

35:13.130 --> 35:14.846
Don't move!

35:14.848 --> 35:16.181
Don't move!

Luke, I got them, I
got them! Go get him!

35:18.268 --> 35:19.300
I'll free them.

35:19.302 --> 35:20.635
I'm not leaving you here!

35:20.637 --> 35:22.137
Go! Do not let him get away!

35:22.139 --> 35:25.106
Go, Luke! I got this!

35:26.927 --> 35:30.995
Please help me! Help me!

35:30.997 --> 35:33.481
Help me! Aah!

35:33.483 --> 35:34.783
Jennifer, help me!

35:34.785 --> 35:37.152
Berto: Jennifer, please! Jennifer!
