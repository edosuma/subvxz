WEBVTT

02:06.943 --> 02:08.335
- Talk to me.

02:37.098 --> 02:38.378
That again?

03:03.809 --> 03:06.788
- The costumes
for the party tonight are...

03:06.812 --> 03:08.812
well, what you'd expect.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.481
Helm Watson
does love some sparkle.

03:13.009 --> 03:14.860
Printed yours yet?

03:18.223 --> 03:19.606
Henry.

03:19.683 --> 03:21.763
Have you printed...
- That was different.

03:22.519 --> 03:24.653
You were different.

03:24.729 --> 03:26.205
- Oh?

03:26.832 --> 03:29.282
- I'm the Alpha.
I'm supposed to lead.

03:29.359 --> 03:30.792
- Yes, I know.

03:31.703 --> 03:32.703
- So.

03:35.832 --> 03:37.216
- Did you like it?

03:39.244 --> 03:42.324
- I told you, it was strange.
- That's not what I asked.

03:42.348 --> 03:43.847
Did you like it?

03:45.100 --> 03:46.936
- You're not making
any sense today.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.310
- It's all right, you know.

03:49.846 --> 03:53.056
If you did, you could... say.

03:53.133 --> 03:54.441
- Lenina.

03:58.388 --> 04:00.188
- Answer the question.

04:00.265 --> 04:02.407
- Give it.
- Sit, and I might.

04:05.061 --> 04:06.301
- You need to act your level.

04:06.354 --> 04:07.696
- I said, sit.

04:07.772 --> 04:09.781
- That's my chair.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.324
This is my office.

04:11.401 --> 04:13.794
- I'm aware.
- So I sit there.

04:15.196 --> 04:18.081
Where you're sitting.
You're seated where I sit.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.457
Oh, you think this is funny.

04:19.534 --> 04:21.251
- It's a simple question.

04:21.328 --> 04:24.888
Did you, Henry, like it?

04:26.207 --> 04:28.102
Do you like not being
in control?

04:28.126 --> 04:29.988
For once?
Just that little moment?

04:30.012 --> 04:32.562
Not knowing what would happen?
What could happen?

04:33.715 --> 04:36.641
I liked it.

04:36.718 --> 04:38.380
Did you like that I liked it?

04:43.350 --> 04:44.983
- That's enough.

04:45.060 --> 04:46.985
- No.
- What?

04:47.062 --> 04:48.387
- You're going to wait.

04:48.463 --> 04:50.207
- Lenina...
- You're going to wait,

04:50.231 --> 04:52.240
and when I give you this soma,

04:52.317 --> 04:54.835
it'll be the very best soma
you've ever had.

04:57.155 --> 04:59.381
Maybe I won't give it to you.

05:01.284 --> 05:03.251
Maybe you never take this soma.

05:03.328 --> 05:04.638
Maybe we never take another soma

05:04.662 --> 05:06.408
for the rest of our lives.

05:06.432 --> 05:07.756
What would happen?

05:19.469 --> 05:21.820
- I didn't hurt you, did I?
- No, I'm fine.

05:24.808 --> 05:26.768
There are other ways to be,
Henry.

05:26.810 --> 05:30.737
Other po...

05:37.362 --> 05:39.371
- We won't do this again.

05:39.447 --> 05:41.298
Do you understand?

05:45.245 --> 05:47.471
Good. It's over now.

06:10.895 --> 06:12.371
- Counselor Marx?

06:15.024 --> 06:16.249
- What is this place?

06:16.326 --> 06:18.118
- Come with me, please.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.213
Do keep up.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.077
- Controller Mond,
thank you so much.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.529
It's an honor to be here, as...
- How goes his integration?

06:43.553 --> 06:45.979
- Ah, yes,
it's... it's going well, I think.

06:46.055 --> 06:47.322
- It's not.

06:47.399 --> 06:49.983
In fact, it's not going
at all, is it?

06:50.059 --> 06:51.745
- Well, he's learning
the system.

06:51.769 --> 06:54.904
I mean, John's
attending sessions daily.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.990
And, um...
Those are every day...

06:57.066 --> 06:59.209
- How can the social body
absorb John

06:59.286 --> 07:00.836
if they never meet the man?

07:02.622 --> 07:04.706
- Yes. True. No, ju... yeah. No.

07:04.782 --> 07:07.625
I suppose John has shown
some reluctance to engage,

07:07.702 --> 07:10.753
um, but there was that incident
at the feelie theater

07:10.830 --> 07:12.806
a few nights ago.
- I am aware.

07:12.883 --> 07:16.509
- Yes, and-and he's lost
his mother, of course,

07:16.586 --> 07:19.679
and his kind,
they don't process trauma...

07:19.756 --> 07:22.043
Very well, at all. Um...

07:22.067 --> 07:23.984
And there's also...

07:25.937 --> 07:27.924
Sorry.
I don't really know how to...

07:27.948 --> 07:29.823
say this, but, um...

07:31.226 --> 07:35.028
I have reason to believe
that the Director,

07:35.104 --> 07:37.956
former Director, um...

07:39.442 --> 07:41.626
May have been John's...

07:43.446 --> 07:44.370
- His father?

07:44.447 --> 07:45.955
- Y-yes.

07:46.032 --> 07:48.917
Yes. I mean, that would explain
why the Director...

07:48.993 --> 07:52.073
I mean, the shame
must have been unbearable.

07:52.097 --> 07:55.548
And given everything
that we're asking of John...

07:55.625 --> 07:57.476
- I think it's best
that he doesn't know.

07:58.461 --> 08:01.021
- No. Of course.
You're right.

08:01.422 --> 08:02.722
I just...

08:02.799 --> 08:04.085
There's also the question
of how the social body

08:04.109 --> 08:06.309
will react to John.
- How are your levels?

08:06.386 --> 08:09.946
- Oh. Um, my levels are fine.
Thank you. Um...

08:13.309 --> 08:15.235
- Your job is not to protect.

08:15.311 --> 08:16.912
Your job is to assimilate.

08:17.981 --> 08:19.873
Introduce John to New London.

08:19.950 --> 08:22.951
Teach him how to think
and show him how he fits.

08:23.027 --> 08:24.235
Show them.

08:24.312 --> 08:26.757
- And, um...
what... what if I can't?

08:26.781 --> 08:28.673
- Then Indra will make
a correction.

08:30.535 --> 08:33.586
- Oh. Indra doesn't do that.

08:33.663 --> 08:35.847
- Tell that to the Epsilon.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.100
I believe you have work to do.

08:40.878 --> 08:42.938
There'll be a new Director soon.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.776
- So.

08:56.853 --> 08:58.773
What did you want to talk about?

09:54.410 --> 09:55.989
- Hello, John.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.199
I'm told you've been making
lots of progress.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.275
That's excellent.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.726
Do you want to step out
for a bit?

10:00.750 --> 10:02.645
- No, I'm good.
- Come on, children.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.231
- Well, you can't stay
in Conditioning forever, John.

10:06.255 --> 10:07.847
- Why not?

10:07.924 --> 10:09.733
- Well, um...
- Food's good.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.684
Kids are pretty cool.

10:11.761 --> 10:13.686
That one's
a sneaky little prick.

10:13.763 --> 10:16.314
Don't give me that look.
You know what you did.

10:16.391 --> 10:18.691
- John, there's
a whole city out there

10:18.768 --> 10:20.744
waiting to meet you.
- We met.

10:21.771 --> 10:23.196
- I understand

10:23.272 --> 10:25.657
why you might be reluctant
after the other night.

10:25.733 --> 10:27.408
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

10:27.485 --> 10:29.004
I'm sure that New London
can be...

10:29.028 --> 10:31.704
well, a very confusing place
for someone like you.

10:31.781 --> 10:33.456
That's why I'm here.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.124
To help you.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.126
And I really think...

10:37.203 --> 10:39.379
- I told you I'm not putting
that shit in my eye.

10:39.455 --> 10:40.816
- It's gonna be very tricky
for you to navigate

10:40.840 --> 10:41.765
without it, John.
I'll bridge the gap...

10:41.841 --> 10:42.965
- What's to navigate?

10:43.042 --> 10:44.395
- Well, people's levels,
for example.

10:44.419 --> 10:47.220
Without a signifier,
you can't see anyone's level.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.140
- Alpha. Alpha. Beta. Beta.

10:51.217 --> 10:54.727
Gamma. Delta. Beta.
Alpha. Alpha.

10:54.804 --> 10:56.281
And of course, the poor bastards

10:56.305 --> 10:57.425
cleaning up are Epsilons.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.898
- Excellent.

10:58.975 --> 11:00.994
Although the Epsilons
enjoy their work.

11:01.018 --> 11:02.138
- Right.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.736
- They do!

11:03.813 --> 11:06.164
- You know, I've been watching
you people.

11:08.651 --> 11:11.411
You got the whole thing rigged.

11:11.487 --> 11:13.880
Back home, we had levels too.

11:16.451 --> 11:18.137
- Well, you know, it's good
that you've been observing

11:18.161 --> 11:20.420
<i>our social body
and how it functions.</i>

11:22.115 --> 11:25.787
<i>You seem to have taken, well,
an awful lot in already.</i>

11:25.811 --> 11:28.678
And I... I know it's hard
for you to understand,

11:28.755 --> 11:30.763
coming from a place
where people...

11:30.840 --> 11:33.193
Well, where people
are dissatisfied.

11:33.217 --> 11:34.818
But here...

11:34.894 --> 11:37.145
- Never seen one
up close before.

11:42.226 --> 11:44.703
I think he likes you.

11:44.779 --> 11:46.279
<i>- Everyone's happy.</i>

11:46.355 --> 11:49.449
Connected. Everyone fits.
- Bullshit.

11:49.525 --> 11:51.036
- Oh, you don't believe me.

11:51.060 --> 11:52.546
<i>Well, why don't we go out
and ask people?</i>

11:52.570 --> 11:54.287
<i>Hmm? We can go outside</i>

11:54.363 --> 11:56.267
<i>and continue to engage
in conversation?</i>

12:22.850 --> 12:23.908
- John.

12:25.228 --> 12:26.369
- Mm-kay.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.849
- Sorry?
- Let's go.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.238
- Great. Good.

12:29.315 --> 12:30.468
You're gonna like it here, John.

12:30.492 --> 12:31.978
Everyone has a place.
There's no hunger.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.669
No violence. Pleasures you
couldn't possibly imagine.

12:35.905 --> 12:37.088
- Hey, kid.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.793
Just takes a flick.

12:50.753 --> 12:52.762
- Is everyone on the court?

12:52.839 --> 12:54.355
I'm sorry, I'm late.

12:55.883 --> 12:57.670
- Is it true?
- Yes.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.393
I am truly sorry.

12:59.470 --> 13:00.904
- You know what I mean.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.316
Is it true you know that Savage?

13:05.393 --> 13:08.986
The one who went wild
in the feelie theater?

13:09.063 --> 13:10.404
Why didn't you tell me?

13:10.481 --> 13:12.894
I had to hear it from Vivian,
of all people.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.395
- I have to tell you everything?

13:14.419 --> 13:16.035
- Yes.

13:16.112 --> 13:18.004
- You know, what if...

13:19.341 --> 13:21.778
Maybe there's a little part
of me that's...

13:21.802 --> 13:23.543
What?

13:23.619 --> 13:25.136
- Mine.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.880
Don't you want that?

13:27.957 --> 13:30.036
Something that's yours?
Something that's...

13:30.060 --> 13:32.635
- It's private,
and solipsistic, and...

13:32.712 --> 13:34.428
Everyone belongs
to everyone else.

13:34.505 --> 13:35.774
- Don't.
- I...

13:35.798 --> 13:37.139
Why are you...

13:37.216 --> 13:39.567
You're being very...
- What?

13:39.644 --> 13:41.110
- Different.

13:44.023 --> 13:47.024
- Maybe I am a little...
- No, you're not.

13:47.101 --> 13:49.902
You're the same as me.
Frannie and Lenina.

13:49.979 --> 13:51.162
We're Beta Pluses.

13:51.239 --> 13:53.739
We like the same things,
we do the same things.

13:53.816 --> 13:56.075
We're the same. Exactly.

13:56.152 --> 13:57.910
The only difference
is that sometimes

13:57.987 --> 13:59.172
interesting things happen to you

13:59.196 --> 14:01.422
for absolutely no reason, and...

14:02.783 --> 14:03.883
- Go on.

14:04.994 --> 14:06.836
It's not fair, is it?

14:06.913 --> 14:10.631
I got Henry Foster.
I was monogamous.

14:10.708 --> 14:12.049
I broke the rules.

14:12.126 --> 14:13.395
I got to go to the Savage Lands.

14:13.419 --> 14:14.894
It's not fair.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.597
- No, it isn't.

14:17.673 --> 14:19.098
You're just lucky.

14:19.175 --> 14:21.484
And you're...
- Say it.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.032
No, don't take that.
You don't have to.

14:25.056 --> 14:26.772
Listen to me.

14:26.849 --> 14:28.900
It'll pass.

14:31.854 --> 14:33.766
- Let go.
- It's okay to feel it.

14:35.858 --> 14:37.116
It changes.

14:37.193 --> 14:43.873
It becomes something el...

14:45.993 --> 14:48.753
- I'm so sorry.
My levels were...

14:48.829 --> 14:50.305
- Don't apologize.

14:55.303 --> 14:57.186
I love that we can joke around.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.463
I just think you take it too...

15:02.843 --> 15:04.444
Let's play.

15:19.402 --> 15:20.660
- Yes.

15:20.736 --> 15:21.994
- What are you doing?

15:22.071 --> 15:23.338
- Winning.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.539
What are you doing?

15:25.616 --> 15:27.653
We're trying
to have fun, right?

15:27.677 --> 15:29.844
- Yeah. I'd like that.

15:31.622 --> 15:32.922
- Take an indigo.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.309
You didn't have it
at last break.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.886
Your levels must be...
- Vivian.

15:35.910 --> 15:38.063
How about this time,
you try to hit it over the net?

15:49.598 --> 15:52.441
- Anyone ready to transition
to the post-match festivities?

15:52.518 --> 15:53.721
- Yes, definitely.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.244
- We're not done.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.340
Lenina, are you okay?

16:09.919 --> 16:11.419
- She's fine.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.839
- See you girls inside?

16:14.915 --> 16:15.965
- Mm-hmm.

16:21.630 --> 16:23.900
- Do you remember when you
could keep up with me?

16:23.924 --> 16:25.558
- Serve.

16:58.334 --> 16:59.592
Ha.

17:11.514 --> 17:12.855
- Well-played.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.440
- You know, you're right.

17:14.517 --> 17:16.137
We are the same.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.497
Same clothes, same hair,
same everything.

17:18.521 --> 17:21.280
We even have sex
with all the same people.

17:21.357 --> 17:23.543
I suppose the only difference
is the order.

17:23.567 --> 17:25.918
You always seem to come second.

17:25.995 --> 17:27.648
Why do you think that is?

17:48.375 --> 17:50.045
- It's time to introduce you
to New London, John.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.152
Properly, this time.

17:51.229 --> 17:52.781
And if you want to make
the right impression,

17:52.805 --> 17:55.075
there's only one person
who has her finger

17:55.099 --> 17:56.302
on the pulse of the social body,

17:56.326 --> 17:58.150
who knows everyone, who...

18:00.604 --> 18:03.072
- What?

18:03.149 --> 18:06.283
- Just... be your best self.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.252
Fuck you.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.274
How bad?

18:19.298 --> 18:21.059
- You remember Pleasure Bomb 88?

18:22.543 --> 18:25.344
Um, you better wait here.

18:25.421 --> 18:27.190
- I think I should
come with you.

18:27.214 --> 18:31.058
- Um, no, no, it's okay.
Zoe will look after you.

18:33.738 --> 18:34.895
- Mm-kay.

18:52.656 --> 18:53.756
Hi.

18:58.162 --> 19:00.921
- I said, get out.
- It's me.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.768
- Bernard,
what are you doing here?

19:05.845 --> 19:08.604
No, go away, don't look.

19:10.674 --> 19:12.141
- Uh-oh.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.755
How many did you take?
- I don't know.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.979
Two? Seven?

19:17.056 --> 19:18.442
What's it matter?

19:18.466 --> 19:20.706
All the greens in the world
don't make a yellow.

19:22.353 --> 19:24.236
But you do, Bernie.

19:24.313 --> 19:27.615
- Yellow is reserved
for acute emotional trauma.

19:29.526 --> 19:32.286
- Yellow. Then be brutal.
Pill first.

19:32.363 --> 19:34.788
- Brutal?
- With your critique.

19:34.865 --> 19:38.959
- Oh, 138. Yes. Um... Very good.

19:39.036 --> 19:42.046
Very, um... wet.

19:42.122 --> 19:44.632
- Not too wet for you?
- No.

19:44.708 --> 19:46.311
- No, I don't know.
For me, personally,

19:46.335 --> 19:48.488
actually, it's kind of,
just the right amount of wet.

19:48.512 --> 19:50.012
- Bernard, did you see
my feelie?

19:54.518 --> 19:56.310
- I will never forgive you.

19:56.387 --> 19:59.230
- I wanted to. I really did.
But there were...

20:06.021 --> 20:08.789
- Orange is the color
of forgiveness.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.713
- And red.
- Not funny.

20:18.242 --> 20:20.218
No, don't take them togeth...

20:22.546 --> 20:24.380
- You're my friend.

20:33.007 --> 20:35.057
- So who's up there?

20:35.134 --> 20:36.776
- Helm Watson.

20:38.262 --> 20:39.862
Wilhelmina Watson?

20:41.098 --> 20:42.523
Director of the Pleasure Bomb.

20:42.599 --> 20:45.346
She's a visionary. Alpha Plus.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.194
- Oh, Alpha Plus.

20:47.271 --> 20:49.947
Big time. Like Bernard.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.000
So what are you, uh...

21:01.076 --> 21:03.168
What are you all doing in here?

21:03.245 --> 21:05.554
- We were banished.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.049
- Banished? For what?

21:14.598 --> 21:17.378
- Did my water haptics
completely revolutionize

21:17.402 --> 21:19.402
the medium and create
an experience

21:19.470 --> 21:22.530
unlike anything
anyone has ever felt?

21:23.524 --> 21:25.774
Yes, obviously.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.662
But that's not the point, is it?

21:27.686 --> 21:28.777
- Isn't it?

21:28.854 --> 21:30.404
- No.

21:30.481 --> 21:33.073
No, Bernard.
No, it's not.

21:33.150 --> 21:34.908
Because they want it all again.

21:34.985 --> 21:38.921
They're clamoring, now,
and I have to give it to them.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.402
But bigger, better, more.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.426
I don't know more.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.355
What if I can't? What...
- Well, you will.

21:45.379 --> 21:46.907
You always do this to yourself.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.048
- And no one helps me.

21:49.124 --> 21:51.434
Surrounded by these people.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.644
These Epsilonic cowards.

21:55.506 --> 21:57.097
They talk about me.

21:57.174 --> 21:58.932
They do. I hear them.

21:59.009 --> 22:00.236
They want me to fail.

22:00.260 --> 22:03.020
Zoe, that pneumatic little Beta,

22:03.097 --> 22:04.813
spying for Marco Hoover.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.089
- Oh, stop it.

22:06.167 --> 22:08.119
- Oh, yes,
and I have to announce

22:08.143 --> 22:10.319
Pleasure Bomb 139 tonight.

22:10.396 --> 22:13.289
I barely have a concept.
All I have is...

22:15.626 --> 22:17.418
You all right?

22:18.570 --> 22:20.296
Don't. Don't talk.

22:23.283 --> 22:25.751
Oh, this is very good soma.

22:25.828 --> 22:28.304
- Soma is soma.
- Don't talk.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.132
Sorry, I thought
I was having an...

22:32.209 --> 22:33.634
- Oh, no.

22:33.710 --> 22:35.561
- Never mind. I'll do it later.

22:36.630 --> 22:38.481
- Helm.
- Yes?

22:40.759 --> 22:42.267
- I've brought you something.

22:44.212 --> 22:46.342
<i>- So let me get this straight.
So she just says some stuff</i>

22:46.366 --> 22:49.691
and waves her hands,
and you do all the work?

22:49.768 --> 22:51.819
- I just calibrate the haptics.

22:51.895 --> 22:53.974
- Right, but the haptics
are the whole thing.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.172
You just told me.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.908
- The haptics
create the sensations.

22:57.985 --> 22:59.660
Like...

22:59.736 --> 23:04.373
The way your skin constricts
when you plunge into water.

23:04.450 --> 23:05.758
- You're doing it again.

23:05.835 --> 23:07.426
You're changing
the subject, Zoe.

23:07.503 --> 23:09.586
- I am?
- Yes, you're being very...

23:09.663 --> 23:11.283
Welcoming.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.715
- Warm. Stimulating.

23:15.419 --> 23:17.094
You're Beta, right?

23:17.171 --> 23:18.336
- Of course.

23:18.414 --> 23:20.075
- Do you ever want
to be an Alpha?

23:22.726 --> 23:25.269
- Everyone wants to be
what they are.

23:25.345 --> 23:28.522
- Can we... Get you anything?

23:28.599 --> 23:30.816
- Trying to have a conversation
here. Thanks.

23:30.893 --> 23:32.451
- Soma fizz?

23:33.854 --> 23:36.363
- Sure. Bring us
a couple of those.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.657
- Two soma fizzes.

23:42.362 --> 23:43.762
- You know, it seems like
the Alphas

23:43.822 --> 23:45.622
have it pretty good. I mean...

23:45.699 --> 23:47.207
- Betas have it better.

23:47.284 --> 23:48.625
Every night's a party.

23:48.702 --> 23:50.105
- Yeah, but don't you
get tired of that?

23:50.129 --> 23:51.679
- Anything else?

23:53.874 --> 23:55.257
- You know what I would love?

23:55.334 --> 23:57.413
Is for you to get it yourself.

23:58.712 --> 24:00.345
You want me to...

24:00.422 --> 24:01.805
But I'm... I'm a Gamma.

24:01.882 --> 24:03.073
- Uh-huh.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.670
- Yeah, but that's the Delta,
that's...

24:04.694 --> 24:06.652
- It would make me super happy.

24:11.391 --> 24:13.817
Where I come from,
everybody wants to be on top.

24:13.894 --> 24:15.402
- Where's the fun in that?

24:15.479 --> 24:17.237
Alphas sit around all day,

24:17.314 --> 24:19.226
worrying about the social body.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.866
If I wasn't a Beta,

24:20.943 --> 24:22.762
I honestly don't know
what I'd do.

24:22.786 --> 24:24.870
- Why do you have
to be anything?

24:24.947 --> 24:26.330
- Stop.

24:26.406 --> 24:27.860
You can't.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.667
I-I mean, we, we don't talk.

24:30.744 --> 24:33.095
Like this.
- Talk like what?

24:33.172 --> 24:35.055
- Well, like you're talking.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.330
- You got a problem
with the way I talk?

24:40.354 --> 24:43.931
- Well. We're not Savages.

24:44.007 --> 24:45.307
- Get up.

24:47.094 --> 24:50.479
Get up, you Beta Minus
motherfucker.

24:50.556 --> 24:52.490
Stand up!

24:54.935 --> 24:56.276
Let's go.

24:56.353 --> 24:58.474
- Where are we going?

25:01.358 --> 25:02.991
- You. Clear these.

25:04.486 --> 25:06.203
Relax, I'm just
fucking with you.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.484
What did you do?

25:08.508 --> 25:10.666
- Me?
- Is that what I think it is?

25:10.742 --> 25:12.760
- Helm, this...
- I know you.

25:12.836 --> 25:15.596
- You do?
- You upstaged my feelie.

25:18.142 --> 25:19.841
I loved it.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.802
Something unexpected at last.

25:21.878 --> 25:23.940
I've never seen anything
pull focus like that.

25:23.964 --> 25:25.542
- Thanks.
- I rescued him.

25:25.566 --> 25:26.752
- Yeah, you and I,
we're going to...

25:26.776 --> 25:28.236
What's that word?
The Savage one?

25:28.260 --> 25:29.393
- Fuck.

25:29.469 --> 25:31.529
- We're going to fuck.

25:32.556 --> 25:33.897
Oh, I love that.

25:33.974 --> 25:35.654
- What?
- Right now.

25:36.435 --> 25:37.513
Best idea I've had today.

25:37.537 --> 25:38.764
- Uh, Helm, a word?

25:38.788 --> 25:40.415
- What?
- John is still adjusting.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.842
And you have to understand
that sex, for Savages,

25:42.866 --> 25:45.253
it's, um...
It's an exertion.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.171
Yeah, no, it takes
an emotional toll.

25:47.195 --> 25:49.775
They need preparation time,
recovery, it's...

25:49.799 --> 25:51.674
Well, it's a deficiency.

25:51.750 --> 25:52.969
But John, I'm sure,
would like to come

25:52.993 --> 25:55.794
to your party this evening?

25:55.871 --> 25:58.931
- Yes. You will bring him.

25:59.976 --> 26:02.788
A sensation for my sensation.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.596
- Your what?
- Oh, it's just a party.

26:05.672 --> 26:07.523
- You're adorable.

26:08.592 --> 26:10.142
Go away.
I have to work.

26:10.218 --> 26:11.810
- Ah. John.

26:18.652 --> 26:20.944
- Why are you all
just sitting there?

26:21.021 --> 26:24.184
- You... banished us. Remember.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.916
- No.

26:26.910 --> 26:29.003
Now get to work. All of you.

26:30.706 --> 26:32.372
Except you.

26:35.619 --> 26:37.544
You get the fuck out.

26:39.873 --> 26:41.465
<i>- Is she serious?</i>

26:41.541 --> 26:44.101
- Everyone here just does
what feels good, John.

26:44.628 --> 26:46.064
What was that commotion
back there?

26:46.088 --> 26:48.107
Everyone seemed kind of
out of sorts.

26:48.131 --> 26:50.232
- They just fell.
It was funny.

26:52.427 --> 26:54.612
Shit just falls down sometimes.

26:55.889 --> 26:58.218
- No, it doesn't, John.

26:58.242 --> 27:00.067
This is your home now.

27:00.143 --> 27:02.547
It's really important
that you learn our ways.

27:02.571 --> 27:03.831
Make connections.

27:03.855 --> 27:05.947
- I'm not like you people.

27:06.024 --> 27:07.502
- Linda wanted
this place for you.

27:07.526 --> 27:10.086
She wanted you to become part
of our social body.

27:23.792 --> 27:25.144
John.

27:25.168 --> 27:26.813
You just need
to embrace this place

27:26.837 --> 27:28.428
and let it be wonderful.

29:03.233 --> 29:04.324
<i>- John.</i>

29:05.477 --> 29:06.869
John.

29:06.945 --> 29:08.487
What's that?
What are you wearing?

29:08.563 --> 29:10.121
- These are clothes.

29:10.199 --> 29:11.834
- Didn't you print the outfit?
It came with the invitation.

29:11.858 --> 29:13.784
This. Yeah.
You... you need to put this on.

29:13.860 --> 29:16.047
- This is more my look.
Gary made it.

29:16.071 --> 29:17.379
He likes me better in this.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.797
- Who's Gary?

29:19.658 --> 29:20.935
- This is Gary.

29:20.959 --> 29:22.334
- John,
Gammas don't have opinions

29:22.410 --> 29:24.055
about this sort of thing.
- Sure they do.

29:24.079 --> 29:25.796
You just never think to ask.

29:25.872 --> 29:27.297
Gary, tell him what you said.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.391
- No, don't put Gary
in this position.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.595
- Gary has a great eye.

29:30.619 --> 29:33.179
Tell him what you said, Gary,
go on.

29:34.548 --> 29:35.731
- John is too long-waisted

29:35.808 --> 29:37.648
for that jacket.

29:38.143 --> 29:39.621
- Gary, could you just give
a moment, please?

29:39.645 --> 29:41.812
It's okay. It's okay, Gary.

29:41.888 --> 29:44.364
Just... Thanks.

29:45.484 --> 29:46.933
You need to put this on.

29:47.010 --> 29:48.746
I understand that
you're intimidated and unsure,

29:48.770 --> 29:49.831
but there's a way of doing it...

29:49.855 --> 29:51.082
- You're intimidated and unsure.

29:51.106 --> 29:52.893
And you look stupid
in that thing.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.291
Mm-hmm.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.922
Look, you told me
to embrace it, right?

29:57.946 --> 29:59.423
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm embracing it.

29:59.447 --> 30:00.901
- Hmm.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.402
- Let's go.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.543
You look great. Come on.

30:10.634 --> 30:13.385
- I imagine you wished you'd
changed your clothes now, huh?

30:13.461 --> 30:14.511
- Nope.

30:15.922 --> 30:17.267
- You know,
if you had your optic in,

30:17.291 --> 30:19.608
you'd be seeing shooting stars.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.854
Two greens, please.

31:28.161 --> 31:29.887
- There you are.

31:42.117 --> 31:45.393
Down there, it all
seems random, just a party.

31:45.470 --> 31:48.396
You have to come up here
to see the design.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.201
They think I just chose
their costumes.

31:50.225 --> 31:52.776
But when I did,
I chose more than that.

31:52.852 --> 31:54.620
Who they'd meet.

31:55.730 --> 31:56.988
Who they'd touch.

32:01.903 --> 32:04.774
It's fun to play Indra
sometimes.

32:04.798 --> 32:07.152
- What's Indra?

32:07.176 --> 32:08.550
- Indra's everything.

32:08.627 --> 32:12.095
The system. The connection.
Indra made all this.

32:13.915 --> 32:16.352
Except that.
I made that.

32:16.376 --> 32:17.926
If you'd have worn what I sent,

32:18.003 --> 32:21.262
you'd have blended in perfectly
with that pattern just there.

32:21.339 --> 32:23.398
- Well, I hope I didn't ruin it.

32:24.843 --> 32:27.113
- Oh, I like that you keep me
on my toes.

32:32.308 --> 32:36.027
- So you made 139
of these things?

32:36.104 --> 32:39.581
Must be hard to keep coming up
with ideas.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.282
What's this one about?

32:41.359 --> 32:44.452
- Firefall. It's about freedom
from gravity.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.871
You know, the moon,
space, floating.

32:46.948 --> 32:49.124
And there's fire.
- Hmm.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.460
But what happens?
What's... what's the story?

32:52.537 --> 32:53.764
- You're on the moon, you float,

32:53.788 --> 32:55.766
you fall into a crater,
and there's fire.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.817
What?

32:58.893 --> 33:02.637
Oh. And there's an orgy
at the end.

33:02.714 --> 33:06.441
- That's... That's not a story.

33:09.479 --> 33:13.314
- I'd need three blues
to go it alone with a Savage.

33:13.391 --> 33:15.117
- There's something
unrestrained about him.

33:15.193 --> 33:16.484
Don't you think?

33:16.561 --> 33:18.622
Like he could snap
at any second.

33:18.646 --> 33:20.583
- Yeah, well,
maybe he'll snap you.

33:24.277 --> 33:25.910
His name is John.

33:25.987 --> 33:27.245
And he's here as my guest.

33:27.322 --> 33:28.663
Not as your entertainment.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.457
- He's your Savage?

33:30.533 --> 33:33.334
- Yes. I rescued him
from the Savage Lands.

33:33.411 --> 33:35.086
- Does he eat a lot?

33:42.054 --> 33:43.178
- He does, actually.

33:43.254 --> 33:45.147
He does.

33:45.223 --> 33:48.650
Always eating. Loves it.
Can't get enough of it.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.102
In fact, for someone who eats
as much as he does,

33:51.179 --> 33:53.521
you'd expect him to be...
well, larger than he is.

34:05.235 --> 34:06.879
<i>- And the people
who had hurt the boy,</i>

34:06.903 --> 34:09.287
<i>they suffered
for how they'd treated him.</i>

34:09.364 --> 34:11.331
But still he wasn't free,

34:11.407 --> 34:13.458
because the demon had
to be paid.

34:13.535 --> 34:15.502
So she came for his mother.

34:15.578 --> 34:18.180
- What did the boy do?
- Well, they ran.

34:18.256 --> 34:19.951
The demon close on their heels,

34:19.975 --> 34:22.383
they ran until they reached
the very edge of the kingdom.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.761
- They escaped. Good.

34:24.838 --> 34:26.118
What?

34:26.982 --> 34:28.242
What? Speak?

34:28.266 --> 34:29.849
- They were trapped.

34:29.926 --> 34:32.027
'Cause just beyond
that frontier,

34:32.104 --> 34:34.229
there was a river of fire.

34:34.305 --> 34:36.364
That's where she caught them.

34:36.441 --> 34:40.055
She grabbed the boy,
lifted him over her head...

34:41.980 --> 34:45.365
- And threw him in the fire.
- What?

34:45.441 --> 34:47.687
No.
- Yeah.

34:47.711 --> 34:49.953
- He burned? Dead?

34:50.029 --> 34:51.913
- That's what they thought.

34:51.990 --> 34:53.985
But what the demon didn't know,

34:54.009 --> 34:56.626
what none of them could know,

34:56.703 --> 35:01.089
is that the boy...
was born in that fire.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.225
He couldn't be hurt by it.

35:03.301 --> 35:05.227
- Not dead.
- Not dead.

35:05.303 --> 35:07.053
Transformed.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.400
- He's a demon too.

35:14.238 --> 35:16.488
- That's actually really good,
I didn't...

35:44.542 --> 35:46.184
- What are we doing?

35:47.462 --> 35:49.437
- Why do they do it?

35:52.967 --> 35:54.609
Why don't we?

35:56.029 --> 35:57.821
- We clean up.

35:58.806 --> 36:00.231
Now.

37:44.353 --> 37:47.922
- Jealousy. Bigotry.
Family. Modesty.

37:47.999 --> 37:52.135
Equality. All the destabilizing
ills of their kind.

37:52.211 --> 37:55.471
Some of these are even
celebrated in the Savage Lands.

37:55.548 --> 37:59.401
So as an Alpha Plus,
I have to consider his...

38:00.386 --> 38:01.881
Conditioning. Hi, Henry.

38:01.905 --> 38:05.356
- I came to see
what all the fuss was.

38:05.433 --> 38:07.826
Imagine my surprise.
It's you, Marx.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.194
- Bernard.

38:10.271 --> 38:11.529
- John.

38:11.606 --> 38:13.707
- Whew. Good party.

38:13.783 --> 38:16.743
- I... you should meet...
- Hello, John.

38:16.819 --> 38:19.421
Nice to meet you.
My name's Henry.

38:19.497 --> 38:22.540
I'm the Director
of the Bureau of Stability.

38:22.617 --> 38:24.334
- Okay.

38:24.410 --> 38:26.210
- Everyone wanted it.

38:26.287 --> 38:29.130
Bernard wanted it,
didn't you, Bernard?

38:29.207 --> 38:31.632
And I never said anything
about wanting it,

38:31.709 --> 38:34.594
but perhaps that's why I got it.

38:34.670 --> 38:36.054
Don't you think?

38:42.970 --> 38:45.146
- So he's, like, your boss?

38:45.223 --> 38:46.531
- Apparently.

38:47.475 --> 38:49.117
- What a dick.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.262
Where are you going?

39:18.339 --> 39:19.430
- Home.

39:19.507 --> 39:20.857
- Fuck it.

39:21.976 --> 39:23.112
- Hey, wait, what are you doing?

39:23.136 --> 39:24.505
- You think I'm gonna
let that guy

39:24.529 --> 39:26.813
talk to my friend like that?
It's humiliating.

39:26.889 --> 39:29.065
- Well, he was just...
stating facts.

39:29.142 --> 39:31.109
- The fact is, he just
squashed you

39:31.185 --> 39:32.663
like a bug in front
of all those people.

39:32.687 --> 39:34.198
You're just gonna take that?

39:34.222 --> 39:35.874
- What am I supposed to do?
- You're supposed to punch him

39:35.898 --> 39:37.832
in the face.

39:39.402 --> 39:40.952
We don't do that here.

39:41.028 --> 39:42.156
- You said this place
is all about

39:42.180 --> 39:43.799
doing what feels good, right?
- It is.

39:43.823 --> 39:45.217
- Okay. Well, I'll tell you
something, Bernard.

39:45.241 --> 39:47.834
You pop that smug little twat
in his grill,

39:47.910 --> 39:49.513
you're gonna feel fucking great.

39:55.251 --> 39:56.884
- Yeah?

39:56.961 --> 39:59.595
Well, what... what would I do?

39:59.672 --> 40:01.172
- Make a fist.

40:01.248 --> 40:02.776
- Make a what?
- Make a fist. I'll show you.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.568
Do it.
Thumb on the outside. Kay.

40:07.531 --> 40:10.176
Yeah. Bend your knees. Okay.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.200
- Well, don't I just...

40:12.477 --> 40:13.818
- No. You do not.

40:13.895 --> 40:15.945
No. Pay attention.

40:16.022 --> 40:18.406
You're gonna turn your hips...

40:18.483 --> 40:21.117
And thrust off your back foot.

40:21.194 --> 40:23.597
Boom! Like that. That's where
the power comes from.

40:23.621 --> 40:24.798
- Whew!
- Whoa!

40:24.822 --> 40:26.225
- Yeah. Whew!
- Whoa!

40:26.249 --> 40:27.759
- Boo!
- Okay.

40:27.783 --> 40:30.543
You don't need to do the sound.
Just... whew!

40:30.620 --> 40:32.295
- Shoo!
- Whew!

40:32.371 --> 40:33.607
Whew!

40:33.631 --> 40:35.756
- Yes. Okay.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.537
- Kind of. It's close.

40:37.561 --> 40:39.313
Wait, will I be okay?

40:39.337 --> 40:41.387
- What?
Might hurt your hand a little.

40:41.464 --> 40:43.233
What the fuck, Bernard?
- Well, how much is a little?

40:43.257 --> 40:45.683
- He just shat all over you.
- All right. Sorry. I know.

40:45.760 --> 40:48.686
- Listen to me.
I know guys like that, okay?

40:48.763 --> 40:50.782
If you let him treat you
like you don't matter,

40:50.806 --> 40:52.398
then you just never will.

40:56.395 --> 40:59.747
That's... not like that.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

41:30.555 --> 41:32.199
- Marx,
what are you doing there?

41:35.619 --> 41:37.096
Ow.

41:44.694 --> 41:47.128
Ah. Ow.

43:03.707 --> 43:06.267
Some view.

43:26.003 --> 43:27.937
- Why'd you do that?

43:33.594 --> 43:35.069
Was it John?

43:37.240 --> 43:39.440
Did he...

43:39.517 --> 43:42.035
- No, it was me.
I think.

43:55.574 --> 43:58.259
It's not quite as good
as the real thing, is it?

44:00.430 --> 44:01.888
- No.

44:07.002 --> 44:08.844
- Do you...
Do you want to go back in...

44:08.921 --> 44:11.375
No.

44:15.779 --> 44:17.019
- Me, neither.

44:41.304 --> 44:43.864
- If we could just
stay right here...

44:44.832 --> 44:46.224
- I know.

44:49.044 --> 44:50.561
- We can't.

44:54.967 --> 44:56.567
- I know.

44:59.614 --> 45:01.489
Maybe just a little longer.

45:40.763 --> 45:41.979
- It's ready.

45:42.056 --> 45:44.016
- What are you waiting for?
Do it.

45:52.525 --> 45:54.492
Firefall.

46:32.314 --> 46:34.657
- The stone
that seemed inconsequential

46:34.733 --> 46:36.292
meant everything.

46:38.153 --> 46:40.087
And you missed it.

46:41.198 --> 46:44.166
- You always were a sore loser.

46:44.243 --> 46:46.385
- Sometimes there's nothing
to be done.

46:47.830 --> 46:49.547
The truth is entropy.

46:49.623 --> 46:51.911
Matter changes states.
Systems decay.

46:51.935 --> 46:54.435
Societies fall.
People die.

46:55.629 --> 46:57.847
- Your move.

46:57.923 --> 47:00.149
- What do you think it means?

47:01.886 --> 47:03.923
That you can't beat me anymore.

47:09.393 --> 47:11.819
I think it means
there's less of you today.

47:11.896 --> 47:15.698
Ending is better
than...
