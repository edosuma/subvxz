01:24.166 --> 01:26.157
When I was a kid,

01:26.166 --> 01:29.158
my dad once took me on a trip
to his favorite fishing hole.

01:29.709 --> 01:32.155
It's a place called Sparrow Lake.

01:32.709 --> 01:35.155
It's the most beautiful spot
you've ever seen.

01:35.709 --> 01:38.155
And whenever I get
a little time off, like now,

01:38.166 --> 01:40.703
I go back, and I try to find it.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.700
But it's an out-of-the-way
kind of spot,

01:42.709 --> 01:45.701
and I always seem to get
a little lost...

01:45.709 --> 01:48.200
and wind up at a crossroads.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.740
38,000.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.241
That's nice.

02:56.792 --> 02:59.249
How you doin'?

03:12.291 --> 03:13.781
Good morning.

03:13.792 --> 03:16.784
I just need some directions
to Sparrow Lake.

03:16.792 --> 03:18.783
Sorry, we're closed.

03:19.291 --> 03:20.280
It's about two miles back

03:20.291 --> 03:22.282
down the road, up,

03:22.291 --> 03:23.280
back at the crossroads.

03:24.834 --> 03:27.826
Uh, where the road forks.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.825
Of course.

03:31.291 --> 03:32.827
My mistake.

03:38.834 --> 03:41.280
Look, I know you're closed,
but could I get some coffee?

03:41.834 --> 03:42.289
Uh...

03:42.291 --> 03:43.280
Yeah.

03:48.834 --> 03:51.325
I'm, uh, Kelly Nielson.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.324
MacGyver.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.823
Nielson Flying School?

03:54.834 --> 03:57.325
That was my dad.

03:59.333 --> 04:00.823
Is my, uh,

04:00.834 --> 04:02.324
breakfast ready, Cook?

04:02.333 --> 04:04.324
Yeah. Comin' up.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.324
Thank you.

04:28.875 --> 04:30.365
Finish it.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.866
Hmm?

04:35.375 --> 04:37.366
Or I will.

05:01.917 --> 05:04.408
It was a little strong.

05:09.917 --> 05:10.906
My name's Terry Andrews.

05:10.917 --> 05:13.408
That is Tennyson.

05:13.917 --> 05:15.908
Is that a great name
for a short-order cook?

05:16.417 --> 05:17.907
Tennyson will fix your breakfast

05:17.917 --> 05:19.407
while you empty your pockets.

05:19.417 --> 05:23.956
I guess this means
I won't be goin' fishin'.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.408
They, uh...

05:32.417 --> 05:34.408
They just came up here
about two hours ago

05:34.417 --> 05:35.406
and took over the place.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.408
Oh, I like girls that talk a lot.

05:39.417 --> 05:40.953
Is that supposed to frighten me

05:40.959 --> 05:41.948
or excite me?

05:41.959 --> 05:43.950
Hey.

05:43.959 --> 05:45.950
Hey, tough guy.

05:49.458 --> 05:51.949
Tough enough to do you some
damage, boy, hmm?

05:52.458 --> 05:53.948
Now, now,

05:53.959 --> 05:56.450
let's all try to get along.

05:56.458 --> 05:57.948
I, uh, estimate

05:57.959 --> 05:59.950
we'll be gone in three hours
and a quarter.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.449
Now, you, uh, rent planes, you

06:03.458 --> 06:05.995
handle charters for fishing
in Mexico.

06:06.001 --> 06:08.447
Just consider us to be your
customers.

06:09.001 --> 06:10.992
And help us pass the time, huh?

06:12.458 --> 06:12.992
Don't!

06:13.458 --> 06:14.994
Dave...

06:15.001 --> 06:15.990
Oh, Davey.

06:16.001 --> 06:16.990
Oh.

06:17.001 --> 06:19.447
Davey.

06:20.001 --> 06:20.990
Davey.

06:21.458 --> 06:22.994
Now, Davey's not gonna do nothing.

06:23.001 --> 06:23.990
Are you, Davey?

06:24.001 --> 06:24.990
You're not gonna do nothin'.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.489
You put your hands

06:26.500 --> 06:28.491
on that girl one more time,
I'm gonna show you

06:28.500 --> 06:31.492
where that gun of yours is
gonna end up.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.990
Please,

06:33.001 --> 06:35.492
gentlemen, gentlemen...

06:36.500 --> 06:38.491
relax.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.491
Ah, the fascination of war.

06:41.001 --> 06:41.990
Some men can't kill.

06:42.001 --> 06:42.990
Others don't mind.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.491
Yeah, but for Buddy, it's

06:45.500 --> 06:46.489
as necessary as breathing.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.490
I wouldn't give him any excuse.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.489
They're here!

06:56.000 --> 06:56.489
Everybody out.

07:29.041 --> 07:31.032
Yes!

07:33.041 --> 07:34.030
Ta-da!

07:34.041 --> 07:36.532
Turk, Elias, you're 40 minutes
past ETA.

07:36.542 --> 07:37.531
Problems?

07:37.542 --> 07:39.533
No way!

07:39.542 --> 07:41.032
Except you drive all night
from Dallas

07:41.542 --> 07:42.531
with the great Stone Face.

07:42.542 --> 07:45.033
He got nothin' to say,
and he don't say it.

07:46.041 --> 07:48.578
Any trouble on this end?

07:48.583 --> 07:50.574
No, not unless Buddy went
and got mean

07:50.583 --> 07:52.039
and shot and ate one of 'em.

07:52.041 --> 07:55.033
You still got that humongous
mouth, huh, kid?

07:57.041 --> 07:58.577
Got it all, buddy-o.

07:58.583 --> 08:00.039
I've got it all.

08:01.583 --> 08:02.572
Ooh!

08:05.583 --> 08:08.074
You just might get lucky,
sweetheart.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.573
Turk, now!

08:10.083 --> 08:11.072
Now!

08:22.083 --> 08:24.074
Move it down.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.616
Come on.

08:34.625 --> 08:36.616
Storage van company in Dallas

08:37.082 --> 08:39.620
is missing their truck right now.

08:40.625 --> 08:41.614
Curious mix of people

08:41.625 --> 08:43.081
around a man like me, MacGyver?

08:50.625 --> 08:54.117
Each one have their specialty,

08:54.125 --> 08:56.116
expertise.

08:56.125 --> 08:58.116
I'd be willin'

08:58.125 --> 09:00.616
to bet you didn't win that
in a raffle.

09:00.625 --> 09:04.664
Everything was planned, timed,
and executed perfectly.

09:11.667 --> 09:12.656
Yo!

09:13.125 --> 09:14.661
There's a man in there!

09:14.667 --> 09:15.656
Yes, so there is.

09:16.125 --> 09:18.116
But, like, uh, most inside guards,

09:18.125 --> 09:19.114
he has no key.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.661
But you'll kill him.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.114
There is that

09:23.125 --> 09:24.160
possibility.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.656
Do it.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.658
60 seconds.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.157
You know,if you blow that door,

09:44.166 --> 09:46.157
you're gonna burn up all
the money inside.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.155
I can open it for you.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.155
Nobody'd get hurt.

09:48.709 --> 09:49.698
With what, your teeth?

09:49.709 --> 09:50.698
Thermite torch.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.155
Made out of what?

09:52.166 --> 09:54.157
That bicycle, and some of the

09:54.166 --> 09:56.703
equipment you got over there,
and, uh, uh,

09:56.709 --> 09:58.700
add a little iron rust,
and I'll cut through that door

09:59.166 --> 10:00.155
like a hot knife through butter.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.702
Come on, what do you say?

10:01.709 --> 10:03.165
It won't cost you anything.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.699
A good plan is always flexible.

10:19.709 --> 10:22.200
We got a couple of minutes
to spare, I guess.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.197
So... try.

10:33.208 --> 10:37.201
A racing bike's made out of
magnesium,

10:37.208 --> 10:41.747
light, strong, and flammable.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.744
When you file it down to a powder,

10:43.750 --> 10:48.744
add some ferric oxide,
your rusted iron,

10:48.750 --> 10:52.242
mix it, tamp it down tight,

10:52.250 --> 10:55.742
you've turned an expensive bike
into a torch.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.741
Use a highway emergency flare
for ignition,

10:59.750 --> 11:02.742
and you've got your hot knife
through butter.

11:04.250 --> 11:08.243
MacGyver, what do you do
by profession?

11:08.250 --> 11:10.787
I, uh, move around.

11:18.792 --> 11:21.784
I suggest you all move back
for this.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.866
Very good, MacGyver.

12:52.875 --> 12:55.867
Very, very good.

13:29.417 --> 13:33.410
Now, a dead body brings
buzzards, right?

13:33.417 --> 13:35.408
I ain't doing no day
labor-- I'm rich.

13:35.917 --> 13:36.906
Oh, no.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.408
MacGyver and Captain Yellow
Streak'll do the digging.

13:39.417 --> 13:40.406
You can watch.

13:40.417 --> 13:41.907
You're all heart, buddy boy.

13:41.917 --> 13:43.908
Well, I try.

13:43.917 --> 13:45.407
Why's that bug you?

13:45.417 --> 13:46.953
You didn't have to kill him.

13:46.959 --> 13:51.407
No... but I wanted to,

13:51.417 --> 13:53.954
and if Andrews didn't see some
potential for the rest of you,

13:53.959 --> 13:55.415
I'd waste you, too.

14:05.458 --> 14:06.447
Start digging.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.994
Kelly said

14:37.001 --> 14:40.448
you were a MedEvac pilot, Dave?

14:41.458 --> 14:42.994
I was.

14:43.458 --> 14:44.994
I'm not.

14:48.001 --> 14:49.992
That's too bad.

14:54.001 --> 14:56.993
I don't fly anymore.

14:57.001 --> 14:58.491
I'm sorry.

15:03.001 --> 15:05.492
I was shot down.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.991
They held me prisoner
for 13 months.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.492
Toward the end,
I was mostly digging graves.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.491
Last one I dug...

15:16.500 --> 15:18.991
was for me.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.490
They tied my elbows

15:23.500 --> 15:24.990
behind my back...

15:25.000 --> 15:27.992
and then made me kneel at the edge.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.537
I don't know how long
I knelt there...

15:33.542 --> 15:35.999
...waiting for that
chrome-plated revolver

15:36.000 --> 15:38.537
at the back of my head to go off.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.991
Then they started laughing.

15:46.542 --> 15:49.033
When they were done...

15:52.041 --> 15:55.533
I know what that sounds like.

15:56.542 --> 15:58.032
Just the truth.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.531
You and Kelly are about
the only ones

16:03.041 --> 16:07.580
who didn't just pass judgment.

16:09.583 --> 16:12.575
Well, I can't stand in
judgment of you, Dave.

16:13.041 --> 16:16.033
I'm not perfect... yet.

16:17.041 --> 16:18.577
Hey, get with it.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.040
Let's keep that dirt flying.

16:21.041 --> 16:23.032
You bet.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.081
Planting season's over.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.081
Ain't that something?

16:52.083 --> 16:54.074
Eight million dollaroonies.

16:54.083 --> 16:57.621
$8,211,600, exactly.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.082
Buy a fresh ammo clip
and a head start.

17:00.083 --> 17:01.072
Cool it, Rambo.

17:01.625 --> 17:04.082
After all, that's the
second best thing going.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.615
Don't you touch her, man.

17:08.625 --> 17:10.115
Why, you got a claim?

17:10.125 --> 17:11.615
Nobody has a claim on me.

17:13.125 --> 17:15.616
Why, what would you do...

17:15.625 --> 17:16.614
kill yourself?

17:16.625 --> 17:18.616
I'd do my best to kill you.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.616
Only make it more exciting.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.115
Aw, come on now, Buddy,

17:22.625 --> 17:25.662
now, that's just bad taste,

17:25.666 --> 17:28.124
picking on girls.

17:28.125 --> 17:30.662
Show a little class for a change.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.116
Buddy, Buddy.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.661
Buddy, not now.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.123
Sparrow Ridge,

17:39.125 --> 17:42.117
this is Baron Zero
Seven Sierra, over.

17:42.125 --> 17:43.661
That's it. That's our charter.

17:45.166 --> 17:46.155
Answer him.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.157
Sparrow Ridge, this is Baron

17:49.166 --> 17:50.155
Zero Seven Sierra, over.
Answer him.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.658
Come on.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.658
Come in, please, Sparrow Ridge.

17:55.667 --> 17:58.659
This is Baron Zero
Seven Sierra, over.

17:58.667 --> 18:01.158
This is Kelly Nielson,
Sparrow Ridge.

18:01.166 --> 18:03.657
We've been expecting you,
Zero Seven Sierra. Over.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.703
Kelly, I have an electrical
short in the trim control.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.700
Can you make repairs,
or should I proceed to Nogales?

18:08.166 --> 18:08.700
Can you fix it?

18:09.166 --> 18:10.155
No.

18:10.166 --> 18:11.702
Do you read me,
Sparrow Ridge? Over.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.702
Your ''no'' came much too quickly.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.165
Tell him to come down.

18:15.166 --> 18:16.702
Kelly, do you read me? Over.

18:16.709 --> 18:17.698
Tell him, now!

18:20.709 --> 18:24.702
Can do, Zero Seven Sierra.
Come ahead. Over.

18:24.709 --> 18:26.199
Roger. See you in 15 minutes.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.698
This is Baron Zero
Seven Sierra, out.

18:27.709 --> 18:29.199
There's no guarantee I can fix it.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.199
Uh, I may not have the parts.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.197
Then a lot of people

18:32.208 --> 18:33.698
could get real hurt real soon.

18:35.208 --> 18:38.200
How about you,
MacGyver-- any ideas?

18:38.208 --> 18:40.199
I can jury rig

18:40.208 --> 18:43.700
a trim control switch.

18:43.709 --> 18:46.746
You got a spare parts bin
I can take a look at?

18:46.750 --> 18:48.206
Good man, MacGyver.

18:48.208 --> 18:49.197
My schedule's

18:49.208 --> 18:51.199
assured with you around.

18:52.750 --> 18:55.742
Show him. You go with them.

18:55.750 --> 18:57.741
I was just cooling down, Terry.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.207
Take the beer with you.

19:14.750 --> 19:15.739
Go easy on the brew, Buddy.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.741
You still got to fly
us out of here.

19:17.750 --> 19:23.245
I just got to take care
of one thing before we split:

19:23.250 --> 19:24.239
MacGyver.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.241
Jury rig a switch?

19:40.250 --> 19:42.787
All Dave has to do is trace
the circuit.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.786
Yeah, I know that,
and you know that.

19:45.291 --> 19:48.283
No one else seems to.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.782
Can you fly that chopper out there?

19:50.792 --> 19:53.784
No, but we keep it maintained.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.282
You asked Dave, didn't you?

19:59.792 --> 20:00.781
Yeah.

20:00.792 --> 20:01.781
You know, it's not his fault.

20:01.792 --> 20:03.282
He would if he could.

20:03.291 --> 20:04.827
It's just that
he's been through so much.

20:04.834 --> 20:07.280
Kelly, I'm not
laying any blame on him.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.827
Seems like a nice guy.

20:08.834 --> 20:12.281
It's been tough... for both of us.

20:12.291 --> 20:15.283
See, Dave and I...

20:15.834 --> 20:18.280
we make allowances for each other,

20:18.291 --> 20:22.284
and we work together pretty well...

20:22.291 --> 20:23.827
at least until this happened.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.827
Get started.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.324
Does that fire truck work?

20:29.834 --> 20:31.825
Pumps run at all? Yeah...

20:31.834 --> 20:34.325
but there are four men
out there carrying guns.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.823
Kind of tough odds.

20:35.834 --> 20:38.826
Let's even 'em up a little bit.

20:42.834 --> 20:45.325
What's that?

20:45.333 --> 20:50.327
Lateral cranial impact enhancer.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.331
He'll be out for a while.

20:57.875 --> 20:58.864
Let's go to work.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.331
Listen, we can't just sail

21:00.875 --> 21:01.330
out of here.

21:01.875 --> 21:02.330
What about Dave and Al?

21:02.875 --> 21:03.330
That's no problem.

21:03.875 --> 21:04.864
We'll take 'em with us.

21:06.875 --> 21:08.866
You didn't happen to use fertilizer

21:08.875 --> 21:09.864
in that garden, did you?

21:09.875 --> 21:11.365
Yeah.

21:11.375 --> 21:12.865
Good answer. Got any left?

21:12.875 --> 21:14.365
Over there.

21:36.917 --> 21:39.374
What are you doing?

21:39.375 --> 21:40.911
Some of the chemicals in fertilizer

21:40.917 --> 21:42.373
and the ether in the Engine Start

21:42.375 --> 21:45.412
will mix together to
make a pretty good bomb.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.406
It's a little recipe
I use in emergencies.

22:20.417 --> 22:21.953
I'll remember that.

22:24.417 --> 22:26.954
Whew.

22:30.959 --> 22:32.449
Listen, why don't you go
back in the cafe,

22:32.959 --> 22:34.449
and bring Dave and Al
when the others run outside.

22:34.959 --> 22:38.952
I won't even ask why
they're going to run outside.

22:38.959 --> 22:41.951
Faith, my dear, faith.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.995
Your, uh, your man says
he's thirsty.

22:58.001 --> 22:58.990
And what?

22:59.458 --> 23:00.994
And MacGyver's almost finished.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.491
?? ??

24:05.542 --> 24:07.032
Come on!

24:15.542 --> 24:17.032
Come on, let's go.

24:17.041 --> 24:18.531
Kelly, you drive.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.032
Come on.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.531
I'll ride up top with MacGyver.

24:21.542 --> 24:22.531
Let's go. Hurry.

24:22.542 --> 24:24.032
Come on, move it, Kelly.

24:24.041 --> 24:25.030
Hurry.

24:29.583 --> 24:30.572
Stop them.

25:13.083 --> 25:15.074
MacGyver, the water tank's empty.

25:30.125 --> 25:32.616
Dave, give me a light.

25:32.625 --> 25:34.616
I got it, MacGyver.

25:34.625 --> 25:37.116
We gotta slow 'em down.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.123
Quick, MacGyver, they're coming.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.661
Where's he going?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.157
Going around us.

26:31.166 --> 26:34.158
Kelly. Where's Kelly?

26:34.166 --> 26:36.703
Dave, give me a light first.

26:39.166 --> 26:42.158
Drop it, MacGyver.

26:45.709 --> 26:48.200
Or have pieces of
her all over the runway.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.783
I owe you one, pal.

27:10.792 --> 27:13.283
You can have what's
left when I'm done.

27:14.291 --> 27:16.782
Let's not fight over me, boys.

27:27.291 --> 27:29.282
Charter flight's coming in.

27:30.291 --> 27:31.827
You come with me.

27:32.291 --> 27:33.827
Be very sensible.

27:33.834 --> 27:36.280
Her life depends on it.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.324
Keep making those sandwiches.

28:09.333 --> 28:10.869
We got a long flight ahead of us.

28:11.875 --> 28:13.866
Maybe we should tie them up.

28:16.875 --> 28:18.331
No...

28:18.333 --> 28:20.369
I got a better idea.

28:31.375 --> 28:32.865
Come on.

28:32.875 --> 28:34.365
Let's go.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.365
Easy, big fella.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.366
Open the door.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.364
Come on.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.366
They'll freeze solid in there.

28:49.375 --> 28:51.912
Probably.

28:52.375 --> 28:53.364
But if you're real nice to me,

28:53.917 --> 28:54.906
I'll let you stay out here.

28:54.917 --> 28:56.373
Open it up, Al.

28:56.375 --> 28:58.366
Ah...

28:58.375 --> 29:00.411
I am crushed.

29:00.417 --> 29:01.907
You heard the lady.

29:01.917 --> 29:04.408
Open the door.

29:08.417 --> 29:09.907
Get the food.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.907
Hi.

29:13.917 --> 29:15.407
I'm your charter.

29:15.917 --> 29:16.906
How do you do, sir?

29:16.917 --> 29:17.906
Good to see you.

29:17.917 --> 29:19.953
We sure are anxious to
get to them fish.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.415
Well, that'll depend

29:21.417 --> 29:23.408
on how long it takes to
make the repairs.

29:23.417 --> 29:24.953
Hey, Dave,where's, uh, Kelly?

29:25.417 --> 29:28.409
I miss her smiling face.

29:28.417 --> 29:29.406
Hey.

29:29.417 --> 29:31.408
Okay, guys, let's do it!

29:35.417 --> 29:37.954
Come on, killer.

29:37.959 --> 29:39.449
Come on.

29:46.458 --> 29:49.450
Oh, God, now what do we do?

29:50.959 --> 29:52.449
Now we're going to get out of here.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.948
How?

29:53.959 --> 29:55.950
Well, I don't know that quite yet,

29:55.959 --> 29:59.451
but I figure we ought
to be pretty quick about it.

30:00.001 --> 30:00.990
Kinda chilly in here.

30:01.001 --> 30:02.457
Did you notice that?

30:36.001 --> 30:38.993
So, Kelly, tell me,
how'd a nice girl like you

30:39.500 --> 30:40.489
end up with a place like this?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.991
I grew up here.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.992
Dave used to work for my dad.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.491
We kinda had something together

30:48.500 --> 30:49.990
before he went to Vietnam.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.990
And got taken prisoner?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.991
The telegram said he was dead.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.491
Killed in action.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.537
Is this some kind of hijacking?

31:04.000 --> 31:04.989
My plane?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.536
You need him for anything?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.536
Back up, Buddy. Back up.

31:11.542 --> 31:13.533
He can help Davey

31:13.542 --> 31:15.533
fix the plane.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.537
The only thing
I'd help is at your hanging.

31:25.542 --> 31:27.032
Walt, they mean it.

31:27.041 --> 31:28.030
Fix it.

31:28.041 --> 31:29.542
And we'll just watch real close

31:29.542 --> 31:31.533
to make sure
you don't make any mistakes.

32:01.583 --> 32:03.574
?? ??

32:18.083 --> 32:21.075
So did you ever
think of leaving here?

32:21.083 --> 32:22.619
I lived in Chicago once.

32:22.625 --> 32:24.616
I even got married.

32:24.625 --> 32:26.081
Six months were
pretty good, and then...

32:27.625 --> 32:28.614
Ah.

32:28.625 --> 32:30.616
Ow.

32:31.083 --> 32:34.621
Ended two-and-a-half years
with the two of us pretending.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.115
What about kids?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.615
Kids need a home,

32:42.625 --> 32:46.117
not two strangers just trying
to be polite with each other.

32:47.625 --> 32:49.616
God, I do want kids.

32:53.625 --> 32:55.115
We're getting there.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.115
I knew you would.

32:57.125 --> 33:00.117
Have you any idea
what Dave has been through?

33:00.125 --> 33:02.662
Yes, ma'am, I sure do.

33:02.667 --> 33:06.114
Shot down, P.O.W.-- excuse me--

33:06.125 --> 33:09.663
a lot of isolation and torture.

33:09.667 --> 33:13.114
Told me he even dug
his own grave one time.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.661
I never heard that.

33:14.667 --> 33:16.123
Yeah.

33:16.125 --> 33:18.116
Ah, it doesn't matter.

33:20.667 --> 33:23.659
What does is that he's still there,

33:23.667 --> 33:25.157
hiding.

33:25.166 --> 33:26.656
I want to help him,

33:26.667 --> 33:27.656
but I just don't know how.

33:29.667 --> 33:33.660
I wish...

33:33.667 --> 33:36.158
I wish for a lot of things.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.656
So do I.

33:39.166 --> 33:42.158
How about a deal?

33:42.166 --> 33:45.158
I'll wish for you
if you wish for me.

33:45.709 --> 33:47.165
Okay.

33:49.166 --> 33:50.702
That we get out of here.

33:50.709 --> 33:53.701
Eh, no problem.

33:53.709 --> 33:56.701
Start making a second wish.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.199
MacGyver, what are you doing?

34:06.208 --> 34:07.698
Water's kinda weird.

34:07.709 --> 34:09.699
It's the only substance
in the world

34:10.208 --> 34:11.697
that expands when it freezes.

34:13.208 --> 34:15.699
Oh, inside the door lock.

34:16.208 --> 34:18.699
Yes, ma'am.

34:28.208 --> 34:29.744
Keep loading. The State Police

34:29.750 --> 34:31.741
should be guessing
we're in Arizona by now.

34:31.750 --> 34:33.206
I want to be in Mexico

34:33.208 --> 34:34.744
before they guess
Sparrow Ridge Airport.

35:11.250 --> 35:13.787
She's still rough.

35:13.792 --> 35:15.248
Good enough. Button her up.

35:39.291 --> 35:40.827
Oh, gee.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.825
They really did a job on the radio.

36:02.834 --> 36:05.826
You got the controls to this thing?

36:05.834 --> 36:08.325
Well, yeah, but, but why?

36:34.875 --> 36:38.868
Okay. Now, we're going to
say good-bye,

36:38.875 --> 36:41.366
we're going to take off...

36:41.375 --> 36:43.866
and that's all she wrote.

36:44.375 --> 36:46.366
Let's go to the diner; come on.

37:01.917 --> 37:03.373
No!

37:03.375 --> 37:05.366
Al, what're you doing?

37:05.375 --> 37:07.912
They're not going to
leave us living.

37:07.917 --> 37:09.373
They're going to do
away with us, too.

37:26.917 --> 37:29.408
You just do what you want to do.

37:29.417 --> 37:31.408
I'm not going out like
no whimpering dog.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.907
So, whatever
you're going to do, man,

37:33.417 --> 37:34.406
you might as well do it here.

37:35.917 --> 37:37.407
Hey, what's going on?

37:42.959 --> 37:44.415
What is that?

37:44.417 --> 37:45.953
Something's on it.

37:50.417 --> 37:51.406
You guys, come on.

37:51.959 --> 37:53.415
Come on!

38:04.458 --> 38:06.449
Get it!

38:06.959 --> 38:08.449
Move!

38:25.001 --> 38:26.457
We got to get out of here.

38:26.458 --> 38:27.994
Not with MacGyver on the loose.

38:28.001 --> 38:28.990
If he tosses another firebomb

38:29.001 --> 38:30.992
when we're in the plane,
we could fry.

38:31.001 --> 38:32.457
He could be anywhere around here.

38:32.458 --> 38:34.995
Then we better find him.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.491
MacGyver!

38:57.500 --> 38:59.491
Where are you?

39:53.542 --> 39:55.533
Buddy!

39:55.542 --> 39:57.533
Turk with you?

39:57.542 --> 39:58.531
No.

39:59.041 --> 40:01.032
He went over toward the moving van,

40:01.041 --> 40:02.030
but he's not there now.

40:13.583 --> 40:15.039
I don't know where Turk went.

40:17.583 --> 40:18.572
Did you check the road?

40:18.583 --> 40:20.574
Yeah. Nothing.

40:20.583 --> 40:24.075
Did you find them?

40:24.083 --> 40:26.074
Come on! They're not invisible.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.574
I'll look around, brother.

40:33.583 --> 40:34.572
Kelly!

40:34.583 --> 40:36.574
MacGyver?!

40:36.583 --> 40:39.074
They're going to
get him sooner or later.

40:39.083 --> 40:40.619
Yeah.

40:40.625 --> 40:42.616
You and your friends are dead!

40:42.625 --> 40:44.081
MacGyver!

40:48.625 --> 40:50.081
I can't fly that chopper, Kelly.

40:52.083 --> 40:55.075
You won't fly it...
and that's different.

40:56.625 --> 40:59.617
Dave, I think she's saying
this is one of those times

40:59.625 --> 41:01.115
when you go one way or the other,

41:01.125 --> 41:02.615
and the rest of your life

41:03.125 --> 41:04.615
depends on which way you pick.

41:04.625 --> 41:08.117
MacGyver!

41:08.125 --> 41:10.116
Here I am!

41:35.667 --> 41:38.659
Turk, is that you?

41:59.166 --> 42:02.704
Nothing. Nothing.

42:02.709 --> 42:04.165
Come on.

42:04.166 --> 42:05.155
Come on, we're losing it.

42:05.709 --> 42:07.165
The whole plan is going to hell.

42:07.166 --> 42:08.702
Warm up the plane, now.

42:08.709 --> 42:10.165
Come on.

42:10.166 --> 42:12.157
We got the money; let's go.

42:19.166 --> 42:20.201
Dave!

42:20.709 --> 42:21.698
MacGyver!

42:21.709 --> 42:23.199
I need your help.

42:23.208 --> 42:24.698
I can't!

42:24.709 --> 42:27.200
I told you, I can't!

42:27.208 --> 42:29.699
We got to stop them.

42:29.709 --> 42:31.700
Why?

42:31.709 --> 42:35.201
We're alive, and I don't give
a damn about the money!

42:35.208 --> 42:36.698
They killed a man.

42:37.208 --> 42:39.199
I give a damn about that.

42:48.208 --> 42:50.199
Okay.

43:22.250 --> 43:25.242
Hey, what's going on?

43:31.792 --> 43:33.248
MacGyver. I'll try and
dump him off.

43:34.792 --> 43:37.784
He's riding the controls.

43:40.792 --> 43:43.784
Blow him away!

46:18.959 --> 46:20.449
Think you can handle this one, Al?

46:20.458 --> 46:21.447
Yeah, it'll be my pleasure.

46:21.959 --> 46:23.449
Come on, let's go.

46:23.458 --> 46:25.449
Move it! Move it!

46:36.959 --> 46:39.450
I'd better help the others.

46:50.458 --> 46:53.996
I'll wish for you
if you wish for me.

46:54.458 --> 46:56.449
Got to be careful
what you wish for, Kelly.

46:56.458 --> 46:59.996
It just might come true.
