WEBVTT

00:00.323 --> 00:01.747
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee:</i>

00:02.173 --> 00:04.241
Kurt's trying to get used

00:04.292 --> 00:05.842
<i>to another school, and Will's
trying to get used to the fact</i>

00:05.910 --> 00:07.244
<i>that Emma went to Vegas with
her boyfriend</i>

00:07.295 --> 00:08.779
<i>- and came home married.</i>
- I'm happy for you.

00:08.846 --> 00:10.013
<i>Brittany thinks Artie's
the best boyfriend ever.</i>

00:10.081 --> 00:11.815
You're magic, Brittany.

00:11.883 --> 00:13.450
<i>Which is what Rachel used to
think about Finn.</i>

00:13.518 --> 00:16.085
<i>But then she learned this
secret about him and Santana</i>

00:16.154 --> 00:18.321
<i>- which made her super mad.</i>
- Do you think she's prettier than me?

00:18.389 --> 00:20.056
<i>- Don't answer that.</i>
- So she made out with Puck,

00:20.124 --> 00:21.758
- which made Finn super mad.
- I'm done with you!

00:21.826 --> 00:23.360
<i>Because his girlfriends are
always making out with Puck.</i>

00:23.427 --> 00:24.794
Boyfriend troubles.
I got that covered.

00:24.846 --> 00:26.179
Considering I'm usually

00:26.264 --> 00:28.265
the cause of them,
I'd say I'm an expert.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.133
<i>It's like a thing. And that's
what you missed on Glee.</i>

00:35.796 --> 00:38.664
- Hey, Will.
- Hey.

00:41.368 --> 00:43.636
Are we okay?

00:43.704 --> 00:45.204
You know, we haven't
really talked

00:45.272 --> 00:46.806
since I told you
about me and Carl.

00:46.873 --> 00:49.008
I mean, we haven't
talked at all.

00:49.076 --> 00:50.610
Are you avoiding me?

00:50.621 --> 00:52.055
Not at all.

00:54.292 --> 00:56.960
So, what are you doing for
Christmas this year?

00:57.028 --> 00:59.095
Just a little quiet time alone
this year.

00:59.163 --> 01:02.465
Will, you can't spend Christmas
by yourself. That's horrible.

01:02.533 --> 01:05.719
Look, um, Carl and I are having
a big Christmas Eve party.

01:05.803 --> 01:07.437
Please at least stop by.

01:07.505 --> 01:11.558
Well, thanks, Emma, that's very
sweet of you guys, but...

01:11.642 --> 01:13.777
I think it's best if we just

01:13.845 --> 01:15.712
keep things separate
for a while.

01:15.780 --> 01:17.848
Yeah, okay.

01:17.915 --> 01:20.016
Okay, educators, gather around.

01:20.084 --> 01:21.318
It's time to pick
your Secret Santa.

01:21.369 --> 01:23.420
Everybody's name
is in the tub.

01:23.487 --> 01:26.323
You get who you get, and you
don't get upset, all right?

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.888 --> 01:43.974
There.

01:44.041 --> 01:47.561
Last year, I left my stocking
up over Christmas vacation,

01:47.645 --> 01:49.846
and an entire family of mice
started living in it.

01:49.914 --> 01:52.082
Their Christmas gift to
each other was rabies.

01:52.149 --> 01:54.317
I told my parents that I
only want one thing

01:54.385 --> 01:55.785
for Christmas this year:

01:55.853 --> 01:58.088
Stop friend requesting me on
Facebook.

01:58.155 --> 02:00.457
What are you
asking Santa for?

02:01.759 --> 02:03.927
- I'm sorry?
- Artie...

02:03.995 --> 02:05.829
The roads to the North Pole
are getting treacherous.

02:05.897 --> 02:08.865
You need to write your
letter to Santa really fast

02:08.933 --> 02:10.433
and get it in
the mail today.

02:10.501 --> 02:13.370
And remember, even the smallest
envelope is heavy for an elf.

02:17.475 --> 02:19.542
No way.

Hey, guys.
What's this?

04:20.863 --> 04:23.466
Oh, we're trying to get into
the Christmas spirit, Mr. Shue.

04:23.534 --> 04:25.135
Christmas is totally my favorite
holiday. And check out

04:25.202 --> 04:27.370
this awesome tree! I found it on
the side of the road.

04:27.438 --> 04:29.506
It must have fell off
some guy's car.

04:29.573 --> 04:31.608
- And the ornaments?
- The guy who lives next door

04:31.675 --> 04:33.443
finally killed off his elderly mother.
And when they carted him off,

04:33.511 --> 04:35.345
they left the house, like,
wide open, so...

04:35.413 --> 04:36.613
I think she was
a holiday hoarder.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.282
Uh... And the presents?

04:39.350 --> 04:42.485
I lifted them from a display at the mall.
But don't worry. They're empty.

04:42.553 --> 04:44.154
Guys, look,
I appreciate the effort,

04:44.221 --> 04:46.573
but this isn't what Christmas is
supposed to be like.

04:46.657 --> 04:47.857
For us, it is.

04:47.925 --> 04:49.626
This tree is like a mascot for
Glee Club.

04:49.693 --> 04:52.695
We won Sectionals
two years in a row,

04:52.763 --> 04:54.914
and according to everyone
at this school, we still suck.

04:54.999 --> 04:56.566
...this reindeer sweater last
year...

04:59.870 --> 05:02.238
- Ooh!
- Ho-Ho-Ho, losers.

05:02.306 --> 05:03.773
Haha!

05:03.841 --> 05:05.442
I'm pretty sure they just added
food coloring

05:05.509 --> 05:06.876
to real slush
from the parking lot.

05:06.944 --> 05:07.944
You can eat that,
you know.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.345
No, no. I am not

05:09.413 --> 05:11.748
gonna let you guys throw
yourselves a pity party.

05:11.816 --> 05:14.484
Look, I'm the first one to say
that things haven't turned out

05:14.552 --> 05:17.287
exactly how I would have liked
them to this year, but Christmas

05:17.354 --> 05:20.423
is all about being grateful for
the things that did.

05:20.491 --> 05:21.825
I thought that was Thanksgiving.

05:21.892 --> 05:24.427
And this year, Glee Club is
going to lend a hand

05:24.495 --> 05:26.479
to the McKinney-Vento Homeless
Children and Youth program

05:26.564 --> 05:28.631
- right here in Lima.
- How are we going to do that?

05:28.699 --> 05:31.651
The only way we know how:
By singing about it.

05:31.735 --> 05:33.136
We're going to go classroom
to classroom,

05:33.204 --> 05:35.038
caroling, to raise money for
McKinney-Vento.

05:35.105 --> 05:37.140
Wait, classrooms in this school?
With like, students in them?

05:37.208 --> 05:39.676
Well, if there are no students
in them, there will be no one

05:39.743 --> 05:41.478
to put money in the collection
box while we sing.

05:41.545 --> 05:42.545
We're gonna be killed.

05:42.613 --> 05:44.180
No, guys, it's Christmas...

05:44.248 --> 05:46.049
A time for miracles.

05:46.117 --> 05:47.183
We got to try this.

05:48.652 --> 05:49.886
Finn's right.

05:49.954 --> 05:51.888
So let's start rehearsing.

05:51.956 --> 05:55.725
This year, Glee Club's going
full Santa.

05:57.895 --> 06:00.980
♪ Haul out the holly. ♪

06:01.065 --> 06:05.902
♪ Put up the tree before my
spirit falls again! ♪

06:05.969 --> 06:08.521
♪ Fill up the stocking. ♪

06:08.606 --> 06:13.776
♪ I may be rushing things,
but deck the halls again now... ♪

06:13.844 --> 06:16.513
- You suck!
- Who goes caroling with a band?

06:16.580 --> 06:18.114
I'd seriously rather be learning.

06:18.182 --> 06:20.583
♪ For we need a little Christmas... ♪

06:20.651 --> 06:22.785
You're making me hate Christmas!
♪ Right this very minute... ♪

06:22.853 --> 06:24.821
♪ Candles in the wind... ♪

06:24.889 --> 06:26.623
Yeah, that's right, leave!

06:26.690 --> 06:29.759
- You suck! I hate you!
- Go, go, go!

06:29.827 --> 06:31.561
I can't believe
that that teacher

06:31.629 --> 06:33.429
let those students speak
to us like that.

06:33.497 --> 06:34.697
I can't believe she
threw her shoe at us.

06:34.765 --> 06:36.566
I guess we're done caroling.

06:36.634 --> 06:38.067
No, we're not, guys.

06:38.135 --> 06:40.770
We can't let what just happened
ruin our Christmas spirit.

06:40.838 --> 06:44.140
Mr. Shue got us this beautiful
tree to inspire us.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.310
We're gonna practice now, and
gear up for round two tomorrow.

06:47.378 --> 06:49.179
Pretty soon,
no one will bully us.

06:49.246 --> 06:52.015
Santa Claus can do anything,
and this year,

06:52.082 --> 06:54.651
I asked for the Glee Club to
stop getting picked on.

06:54.718 --> 06:55.702
She's kidding, right?

06:55.786 --> 06:58.154
Guys, this is serious.
Listen up.

07:01.659 --> 07:03.226
Brittany still believes
in Santa Claus.

07:05.196 --> 07:07.830
- You cannot be serious.
- Last week, Brittany believed a comb had magic powers.

07:07.898 --> 07:11.434
- This is kind of a pattern.
- She's gonna find out sooner or later.

07:11.502 --> 07:12.969
Would you mind, um...

07:13.037 --> 07:15.705
- meeting me at the auditorium tomorrow at 4:00?
- Sure.

07:15.773 --> 07:18.441
- Okay, somebody needs to break the news to her.
- Uh-uh. Don't look at me.

07:18.509 --> 07:20.343
I mean, I'm cruel and all,
but that's just hardcore.

07:20.411 --> 07:22.679
Right! That's my point!
Hear me out.

07:22.746 --> 07:25.381
Remember when you were a kid,
how excited you would get

07:25.449 --> 07:26.950
when you would think
about Santa Claus?

07:27.017 --> 07:28.751
How awesome it was?

07:28.819 --> 07:30.386
Christmas was the highlight
of the year.

07:30.454 --> 07:32.188
Why wouldn't you want to keep
someone's world

07:32.256 --> 07:34.490
magical for a little while
longer?

07:34.558 --> 07:38.194
- How?
- I've got it all figured out.

07:44.516 --> 07:46.200
Can I be honest?

07:46.285 --> 07:49.554
I don't understand the difference
between an elf and a slave.

07:51.390 --> 07:52.823
I'm not sitting
on that guy's lap.

07:52.875 --> 07:56.727
Santas' laps are always
really warm, and it's creepy.

07:56.795 --> 07:59.163
We all have to sit on Santa's lap.
If Brittany sees that we

07:59.231 --> 08:01.365
all still believe, it will make
her strong enough to withstand

08:01.433 --> 08:02.900
all the Santa naysayers
in the world.

08:02.968 --> 08:05.002
Which is everyone
over the age of six.

08:05.070 --> 08:07.305
I'm pretty sure
this isn't going to work.

08:07.372 --> 08:08.606
That guy doesn't
even look like Santa.

08:08.673 --> 08:11.442
Trust me, all Brittany's gonna
see is the suit.

08:11.510 --> 08:12.743
She wants to believe in him.

08:12.811 --> 08:15.513
Mercedes, get up there.

08:15.581 --> 08:17.448
Go, Mercedes, go, Mercedes, go.

08:17.515 --> 08:18.950
I've been a very good girl, Santa.

08:19.017 --> 08:23.571
I want a pony, and a doll
that laughs and cries and...

08:23.655 --> 08:26.490
One of us smells like McDonalds.

08:26.558 --> 08:29.710
I would like Puckerman to
love me. He's a fox.

08:29.795 --> 08:31.913
I would also like
sweet potato fries.

08:31.997 --> 08:33.764
I want bling. I can't be any
more specific than that.

08:33.832 --> 08:35.131
Okay, wait, hold up.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.885
Please tell me that is a roll
of Certs in your pocket.

08:37.970 --> 08:39.636
Do you have anything
for stretch marks?

08:39.703 --> 08:40.938
ChapStick. Lots of ChapStick.

08:41.006 --> 08:43.541
I want Channing Tatum
to stop being in stuff.

08:43.609 --> 08:45.042
When does Asian Santa arrive?

08:45.053 --> 08:45.992
Next.

08:47.512 --> 08:49.847
Just know, you have rights.

08:49.915 --> 08:50.932
Ho, ho, ho!

08:53.185 --> 08:55.586
- What's your name?
- Brittany.

08:55.654 --> 08:57.488
You've gotten really tan.

08:57.556 --> 09:00.424
That's because at the North Pole
there's a hole in the ozone.

09:00.492 --> 09:02.426
You're amazing.

09:02.494 --> 09:04.462
I know you're really busy,

09:04.529 --> 09:07.665
so I only want one
thing for Christmas.

09:07.733 --> 09:10.968
Do you see my
boyfriend over there?

09:11.036 --> 09:14.906
For Christmas, I want
him to be able to walk.

09:16.141 --> 09:17.508
You can do that,
can't you, Santa?

09:22.681 --> 09:25.983
Sure... I'm on it.

09:26.051 --> 09:29.253
- Thank you so much, Santa.
- Now we're screwed.

09:33.642 --> 09:36.460
Now, remember,
it has to be lush and romantic.

09:36.528 --> 09:38.229
Why?

09:38.280 --> 09:41.832
Because I am very specific
when I give a gift.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.401
You don't know how many kittens

09:43.468 --> 09:46.203
I've given away because they
haven't been just right.

09:46.271 --> 09:49.373
So, do you like my
winter wonderland?

09:49.441 --> 09:52.043
Well, I don't really like
artificial Christmas trees.

09:52.110 --> 09:53.477
I like real ones.

09:53.545 --> 09:55.513
They smell amazing.
That's kind of the whole point.

09:55.580 --> 09:58.416
Right.

09:58.483 --> 09:59.917
Anyway...

10:03.621 --> 10:05.022
Merry Christmas.

10:05.090 --> 10:08.092
Being a Jew, I generally
don't give Christmas gifts,

10:08.160 --> 10:10.177
but considering how much you
care about the holiday

10:10.262 --> 10:13.631
I figured I'd
make an exception.

10:13.699 --> 10:15.933
Just... Read it.
It's a note.

10:16.001 --> 10:17.969
"The bearer of this note is
entitled to one song

10:18.036 --> 10:21.138
of Rachel Berry's choosing,
sung to him or her with love."

10:21.206 --> 10:23.441
At least it's not a kitten.

10:23.508 --> 10:25.192
- Come sit.
- I... I don't think so.

10:25.277 --> 10:28.312
I know what you're trying to do,
and it's not going to work.

10:28.380 --> 10:30.314
Look, not letting me apologize
isn't fair.

10:30.382 --> 10:33.017
I've let you apologize
plenty, and I know

10:33.085 --> 10:35.186
that Christmas is supposed to
be about forgiveness but...

10:35.253 --> 10:38.089
I'm not ready to forgive you,
so please stop trying to make me.

10:42.561 --> 10:48.132
- Should we, like, leave?
- No.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.835
Whether it's a heart attack or
heartbreak,

10:51.887 --> 10:56.007
just like on Broadway,
the show must go on.

10:56.074 --> 10:59.610

Good. Because I'm

13:43.608 --> 13:46.009
I'm here to tell you

13:46.061 --> 13:48.012
to stop studying so hard.

13:48.079 --> 13:49.647
Hmm. What's with the boom box?

13:49.714 --> 13:52.049
I need you to sing with me.
Well, rehearse with me.

13:52.117 --> 13:54.451
I got a gig singing
"Baby, It's Cold Outside"

13:54.519 --> 13:56.287
in the King's Island
Christmas Spectacular.

13:56.354 --> 13:58.055
Ah, a personal favorite.

13:58.123 --> 14:00.758
Too bad they'd never
let us sing it together.

14:00.825 --> 14:03.561
I mean, as two... artists.

14:03.628 --> 14:06.430
Mmm. So you going to
help me out here?

14:06.498 --> 14:08.299
Anything to get me to stop

16:25.337 --> 16:27.671
you are much better than
that girl's going to be.

16:30.141 --> 16:32.343
Hey.

16:32.410 --> 16:34.111
Mr. Schuester.

16:35.447 --> 16:37.715
Oh, good to see you, Kurt.

16:37.782 --> 16:39.182
Someone special?

16:40.385 --> 16:41.785
No, just a friend.

16:41.853 --> 16:44.021
But on the upside,
I am in love with him,

16:44.089 --> 16:46.056
and he's actually gay.
I call that progress.

16:46.124 --> 16:48.592
How you doing?

16:48.660 --> 16:50.594
Classes are harder,
but the kids are kinder.

16:50.662 --> 16:52.496
But I miss you guys a lot,
though.

16:52.564 --> 16:53.997
So what brings you here?

16:54.065 --> 16:55.766
Are you looking
for teaching at a place

16:55.834 --> 16:57.534
where pencils aren't
primarily used as weapons?

16:57.602 --> 17:00.871
Actually, I need
some holiday help.

17:00.939 --> 17:03.073
I don't know if you know this,

17:03.141 --> 17:05.943
but I am really bad
at Christmas shopping.

17:09.347 --> 17:11.080
Oh, honey,
just what I wanted.

17:11.148 --> 17:13.550
Jumper cables.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.553
This year, I drew Sue
in the office pool Secret Santa.

17:16.621 --> 17:19.790
And I tell you,
I can't think of anything good.

17:19.858 --> 17:21.224
And you are so great
at shopping,

17:21.291 --> 17:23.861
- I thought I'd...
- I have the perfect idea.

17:25.797 --> 17:28.165
I think I can tell
who wrapped that.

17:28.233 --> 17:29.333
Who's it for?

17:29.401 --> 17:30.601
Oh, Sue.

17:30.668 --> 17:32.870
I drew her as my Secret Santa.

17:32.937 --> 17:35.139
Wait a minute.
That's not possible.

17:35.206 --> 17:39.343
- Sue's my Secret Santa.
- No, Sue's my Secret Santa.

17:39.411 --> 17:42.146
I'm everybody's Secret Santa.

17:42.213 --> 17:43.947
Yeah, you can just
drop those wherever.

17:44.015 --> 17:45.649
You rigged Secret Santa?

17:45.717 --> 17:47.418
How? It was my idea.

17:47.485 --> 17:49.319
Well, you're not the only person
at this school

17:49.387 --> 17:51.054
who consumes protein powder
by the tubful.

17:52.590 --> 17:54.725
<i>Remember when I told you
I was taking</i>

17:54.793 --> 17:57.828
<i>all those science textbooks
to an exorcist?</i>

17:57.896 --> 17:59.997
<i>Well, that's what we call
a diversion.</i>

18:04.502 --> 18:06.737
You filled your tub
with your name only.

18:06.805 --> 18:07.905
You're a regular
Agatha Christie,

18:07.972 --> 18:09.940
except even more sexless.

18:10.008 --> 18:13.877
See, people, I hate Christmas,
but I love presents.

18:13.945 --> 18:14.912
Ah, look at this.

18:14.979 --> 18:16.413
It's a track suit

18:16.481 --> 18:18.482
with a fur-lined hood
for the winter months.

18:18.550 --> 18:19.683
Thanks, fella.

18:19.751 --> 18:20.684
That was Kurt's idea.

18:20.752 --> 18:21.785
Ah-ah-ah, William.

18:21.853 --> 18:23.120
These gifts are legally mine.

18:23.188 --> 18:25.189
Now, you may or may
not be aware of this,

18:25.256 --> 18:27.290
but I'm an honorary officer
of the Lima Police Department,

18:27.342 --> 18:29.343
and if you take my property
out of my office,

18:29.427 --> 18:31.695
I will pick up that phone and
have you arrested for theft.

18:31.763 --> 18:34.164
We are not going to let you
steal Christmas, Sue.

18:34.232 --> 18:36.467
- You're not going to get away with this.
- I think I already have.

18:36.534 --> 18:39.036
William, Elmo, you,

18:39.103 --> 18:40.704
get the hell out of my office.

18:42.340 --> 18:45.242
I just got to say, this
is a really expensive blender.

18:45.310 --> 18:47.311
It's top of the line.

18:57.188 --> 18:58.322
At ease, Becky.

19:05.234 --> 19:07.435
I'm gonna stop you right here.
Why are you wearing that hat?

19:07.503 --> 19:08.837
Because it's Christmas
and it's fun.

19:08.904 --> 19:10.505
No, it's offensive.
You're wearing a Santa Claus hat,

19:10.573 --> 19:12.407
and yet you're handing me
no gifts. I need gifts.

19:12.474 --> 19:13.942
- You want my hat?
- It's a start.

19:16.445 --> 19:17.445
Coach, we've got a problem.

19:19.081 --> 19:20.215
Thanks, guys.

19:20.282 --> 19:22.383
Those go under the tree
in the choir room.

19:22.451 --> 19:24.586
Plop it down there.
Thank you.

19:24.653 --> 19:26.054
Can you believe it?

19:26.121 --> 19:28.690
Six different people
got Sue a Shake Weight.

19:28.757 --> 19:30.892
Mmm.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.660
Becky, go into the glove box
of my LeCar

19:32.728 --> 19:35.797
and bring me my tear gas.
Then, get me Gloria Allred.

19:36.999 --> 19:38.566
Merry Christmas, Sue.

19:38.634 --> 19:40.401
As you can see, we're
repo'ing your gifts.

19:40.469 --> 19:42.537
Most can't be returned

19:42.605 --> 19:44.706
since you inexplicably opened
all of them.

19:44.773 --> 19:46.674
And I licked each one
so no one would touch them.

19:46.742 --> 19:48.176
So the staff has
agreed to donate them

19:48.244 --> 19:50.311
to the homeless kids
at McKinney-Vento.

19:50.379 --> 19:51.779
I mean, what is your
problem anyway?

19:51.847 --> 19:53.381
Were you one
of those kids

19:53.449 --> 19:54.749
who never got presents
at Christmas?

19:54.817 --> 19:57.051
Yes, Dr. Laura.
As a matter of fact, I was,

19:57.119 --> 19:58.686
and I'm making up for it now.

19:58.754 --> 20:00.221
Face it, Sue. We won.

20:00.289 --> 20:02.357
This will not stand.

20:02.424 --> 20:04.993
I have legal rights
to those gifts.

20:05.060 --> 20:06.427
You know what, Sue?
You don't.

20:06.495 --> 20:07.862
I checked with
Human Resources,

20:07.930 --> 20:09.564
and because you
misrepresented yourself,

20:09.632 --> 20:12.367
it is within our legal right
to take back these gifts.

20:12.434 --> 20:14.702
Ho, ho, ho.

20:19.541 --> 20:21.609
You know what you are, Sue?

20:21.677 --> 20:22.710
You're a grinch.

20:27.950 --> 20:29.417
Are you guys punking me?

20:29.485 --> 20:31.419
I thought we were cool after
you sang me that song.

20:31.487 --> 20:33.154
This is serious, Coach.

20:33.222 --> 20:35.390
Remember when you were a kid,
the way you felt

20:35.457 --> 20:37.025
when you came downstairs
on Christmas morning,

20:37.092 --> 20:38.426
seeing that Santa had come?

20:38.494 --> 20:40.228
I do love Santa Claus.

20:40.296 --> 20:42.830
One year, I asked him
for a full set of free weights.

20:42.898 --> 20:45.300
Kept asking my dad,
"How did Santy get

20:45.367 --> 20:46.801
those 75-pound dumbbells
down the chimney?"

20:46.869 --> 20:48.903
Should have suspected something

20:48.971 --> 20:51.105
when Dad was in traction
until the end of January.

20:51.173 --> 20:52.840
You've got the perfect
Santa body type.

20:52.908 --> 20:53.908
Watch it, Puckerman.

20:53.976 --> 20:55.443
Look, we rented the suit.

20:55.511 --> 20:56.644
All you need to do
is put it on.

20:56.712 --> 20:58.579
Just tell her
that you can't give her

20:58.647 --> 21:00.081
the gift of me
walking this year.

21:00.149 --> 21:02.116
That seems so harsh
and not at all like Santa.

21:02.184 --> 21:03.635
She asked Santa
for the impossible:

21:03.719 --> 21:05.119
Me walking again.

21:05.187 --> 21:07.055
If Christmas morning
comes around and I'm not

21:07.122 --> 21:09.891
dancing in Glee Club rehearsal
with no personal explanation

21:09.959 --> 21:12.226
from her idol, she's going
to lose faith in Old Saint Nick,

21:12.294 --> 21:13.628
and we can't have that.

21:13.696 --> 21:15.063
Tell her the elves
are working on it.

21:15.130 --> 21:17.865
Elves have awesome cord blood
for stem cell research,

21:17.933 --> 21:20.101
but these advances
are a few years away.

21:21.303 --> 21:22.704
Okay.

21:22.771 --> 21:25.039
Great. And then we need you
to break into her house.

21:25.107 --> 21:26.908
- What? No, no way!
- The back door will be open.

21:26.976 --> 21:30.745
I talked to her parents. They
really want her to believe, too.

21:32.865 --> 21:34.382
Look, Coach.

21:34.450 --> 21:36.751
The janitor staff
got you hideous gloves.

21:36.818 --> 21:38.219
Give me those.

21:38.287 --> 21:39.587
They'll come in handy.

21:39.655 --> 21:41.356
No fingerprints.

21:41.423 --> 21:43.558
Suit up, Becky.

21:43.625 --> 21:47.295
I don't understand
why we have to dress up, Coach.

21:47.346 --> 21:50.465
Well, this way,
if anyone sees us,

21:50.532 --> 21:53.134
we'll have plausible
deniability.

21:53.202 --> 21:55.236
I repeat, you are a "rein-dog."

21:55.304 --> 21:57.138
Trust me, they're real.

21:57.206 --> 21:58.106
How am I looking?

21:58.173 --> 21:59.140
Fantastic, Coach.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.042
Yeah, you know, Becky,

22:01.110 --> 22:03.177
my mastery of camouflage
is the only thing

22:03.245 --> 22:04.862
that kept me
from being court-martialed

22:04.947 --> 22:06.981
after that My Lai
misunderstanding.

22:07.049 --> 22:08.282
Copy that.

22:08.350 --> 22:10.818
Now, let's go get
what is rightfully mine.

22:10.886 --> 22:12.553
Schuester thinks I'm a grinch,

22:12.621 --> 22:14.188
well, that's exactly
what he's gonna get.

22:20.212 --> 22:25.049
♪ You're a mean one,
Sue the Grinch. ♪

22:25.134 --> 22:29.037
♪ You really are a heel. ♪

22:29.104 --> 22:33.374

A greasy black peel. ♪

23:28.313 --> 23:30.298
Becky, load it up.

23:34.336 --> 23:35.803
Santa?

23:35.871 --> 23:38.439
Why, Brittany.

23:38.507 --> 23:40.775
What are you doing here?

23:40.843 --> 23:44.378
I'm bringing a gift to put under
the tree for the homeless kids.

23:44.446 --> 23:45.813
It's a dollhouse.

23:45.881 --> 23:47.248
At least their dolls
won't be homeless.

23:48.317 --> 23:50.284
What are you doing, Santa?

23:50.352 --> 23:53.254
Well, you see, Brittany,
uh, one of the lights

23:53.305 --> 23:54.822
on the tree
isn't working.

23:54.890 --> 23:57.658
So I'm bringing it back
home to my workshop.

23:57.726 --> 24:00.728
I'll fix it up there,
and I'll bring it back here.

24:01.730 --> 24:02.497
Oh.

24:04.700 --> 24:06.968
Shuffle on home.

24:32.987 --> 24:34.287
They took everything.

24:34.355 --> 24:35.689
Including all of Sue's
Secret Santa gifts

24:35.756 --> 24:37.123
we were gonna give
to the homeless kids.

24:37.191 --> 24:38.625
Only further proof

24:38.693 --> 24:40.427
that everyone in this school
hates us no matter what we do.

24:40.495 --> 24:42.028
It's not the school.

24:42.096 --> 24:43.363
It's Sue.
She did this.

24:43.431 --> 24:45.065
It wasn't Sue, it was Santa.

24:45.132 --> 24:46.933
He said a light was out on
the tree, he'd fix everything.

24:47.001 --> 24:48.168
We just need to let him
do his thing.

24:50.588 --> 24:53.673
Okay.

24:53.741 --> 24:55.008
Are you sure

24:55.076 --> 24:56.877
Santa was a boy
and not a girl, Brittany?

24:56.944 --> 24:58.061
I swear on my life.

24:58.145 --> 24:59.513
Santa's a boy.
Everybody knows that.

24:59.580 --> 25:01.047
It was probably one of the boys
on the football team.

25:03.217 --> 25:05.018
I guess it wasn't Sue.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.486
So our tree is gone.

25:06.554 --> 25:08.088
So our presents are missing.

25:08.155 --> 25:10.323
Santa's probably fixing any
dents or chips as we speak.

25:10.391 --> 25:13.093
All around the world today,

25:13.160 --> 25:15.128
way worse things have happened
to people than this.

25:15.196 --> 25:17.497
Sorry, but I'm not going
to let this get us down.

25:18.933 --> 25:20.233
'Tis the season.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.202
I agree. Come on, guys,
let's clean this up.

25:24.422 --> 25:27.073
Come on.

25:27.124 --> 25:28.842
Finn.

25:28.909 --> 25:30.844
You and I are
the leaders of this club.

25:30.912 --> 25:32.946
All right,
we need to fix this.

25:33.014 --> 25:34.948
We have to put everything
that's happened behind us

25:35.016 --> 25:37.934
and save Christmas
for the Glee Club.

25:38.019 --> 25:40.253
I want to make this right.

25:47.261 --> 25:49.279
You smell kind of funny.

25:49.363 --> 25:51.298
Oh, I, um,

25:51.365 --> 25:53.283
I put this on
for the car ride over.

25:53.367 --> 25:55.635
I know how much you love
the smell of Christmas pine.

25:55.703 --> 25:57.637
But guess I don't
really need it

25:57.705 --> 25:59.773
now that we have the real thing.

26:01.609 --> 26:03.476
It's so cold out.

26:03.544 --> 26:05.412
It's cuddle weather.

26:05.479 --> 26:08.415
It's unseasonably warm, actually,
for this time of year, but, uh...

26:08.466 --> 26:11.351
I just, I really wanted
to come here with you.

26:11.419 --> 26:14.154
I mean, the Christmas tree is
the foundation of Christmas.

26:14.221 --> 26:16.089
It's the hearth of
the Christmas home.

26:16.157 --> 26:18.558
Without it, there wouldn't be
anywhere to hang the ornaments

26:18.626 --> 26:20.560
or put the presents under.

26:20.628 --> 26:21.561
Yeah, yeah.

26:21.629 --> 26:22.896
Whenever we put the tree up,

26:22.964 --> 26:24.164
I always knew
Christmas was really here.

26:24.231 --> 26:27.100
This one's too small.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.568
- But, uh...
- Oh, I love this song.

26:28.636 --> 26:29.986
It's, uh, it's my
favorite Christmas song.

26:30.071 --> 26:31.004
It's Wham!

26:31.072 --> 26:32.522
Yeah, yeah.

26:32.607 --> 26:33.573
Cool.

26:33.641 --> 26:35.108
Um...

26:35.176 --> 26:36.977
I'm going to look down
this row of Frasier firs.

26:37.044 --> 26:38.912
Maybe you could
check out the Douglases

26:38.980 --> 26:40.614
and I'll meet you at the end.

Last year, for Christmas,

I asked Santa to give me you.

28:36.781 --> 28:38.932
It's not last year anymore.

28:38.999 --> 28:40.767
It's Christmas, Finn.
It's time for you to forgive me.

28:40.818 --> 28:41.868
No, I can't.

28:43.237 --> 28:44.437
Okay, this is wrong.
I shouldn't...

28:44.505 --> 28:45.538
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

28:47.274 --> 28:48.608
You messed me up, Rachel.

28:48.676 --> 28:52.378
Can't you see
how screwed-up I am about this?

28:52.446 --> 28:54.914
I've had two girlfriends, and
both of them have cheated on me.

28:56.650 --> 29:00.887
Maybe you can ask Santa again
for me next year.

29:00.955 --> 29:02.722
I'm officially
breaking up with you.

29:13.138 --> 29:14.372
This was my dad's.

29:14.440 --> 29:17.375
He'd want you to do it.
For those kids.

29:20.346 --> 29:22.814
This was my uncle's.

29:22.881 --> 29:25.383
It's the first thing
I ever stole, actually.

29:27.019 --> 29:28.119
I'm going to look terrible.

29:28.187 --> 29:29.420
Shut up.
With your bone structure,

29:29.488 --> 29:30.772
you could rock
the <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> look

29:30.856 --> 29:32.557
and still look good.

29:32.625 --> 29:34.025
I'm going to look
like Jackie Chan.

29:34.093 --> 29:36.027
If Barbra can pull off a bob,
so can I.

29:36.095 --> 29:37.261
Enough yapping, let's do this.

29:37.329 --> 29:38.796
Whoa! Whoa!
What are you guys doing?

29:38.864 --> 29:40.765
We're going all "Gift of
the Magi" to raise money

29:40.833 --> 29:42.800
to buy homeless kids
those school supplies.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.636
The guys are gonna
sell their watches

29:44.703 --> 29:46.571
and the girls are gonna
sell off their hair.

29:46.639 --> 29:48.206
- You can't do that.
- Oh, no, it's cool.

29:48.273 --> 29:49.374
Most of this isn't mine,
anyways.

29:49.441 --> 29:50.875
No, I mean,
that's not the answer.

29:50.943 --> 29:53.044
There are other ways to raise
money at Christmastime.

29:53.112 --> 29:55.079
No, but we tried caroling,
and it didn't work.

29:55.147 --> 29:57.548
Wait, I thought you and Finn
were getting us a new tree.

29:57.616 --> 30:00.685
We went, but Finn bailed
before we could get one.

30:00.753 --> 30:02.553
Nice Christmas spirit, Finn.

30:02.621 --> 30:03.321
Wait!

30:03.389 --> 30:05.189
Guys, no more fighting.

30:06.759 --> 30:09.193
Have any of you ever actually
read "Gift of the Magi"?

30:11.430 --> 30:13.531
None of you?

30:13.599 --> 30:15.099
You don't have to read
"Gift of the Magi."

30:15.167 --> 30:16.100
everybody knows what it's about.

30:16.168 --> 30:18.102
Well, if you actually read it,

30:18.170 --> 30:19.637
you'd know what it's about.

30:19.705 --> 30:22.173
Yeah, I know what it's about:
Life freakin' sucks.

30:22.241 --> 30:23.607
Actually, you're right.

30:26.245 --> 30:27.478
The first Christmas
you remember having

30:27.546 --> 30:29.047
is the greatest day
of your life.

30:29.114 --> 30:30.515
Your family's all together,

30:30.582 --> 30:32.350
there are loads
of presents, cookies.

30:32.418 --> 30:33.885
The magic is
alive and well.

30:33.952 --> 30:37.822
But before you know it,
you grow up.

30:37.890 --> 30:40.258
Work and school
and girlfriends take over

30:40.325 --> 30:42.293
and Christmas becomes
more of an obligation,

30:42.361 --> 30:45.830
a reminder of what's lost
instead of what's possible.

30:45.898 --> 30:47.932
And all of the trees
and the presents

30:48.000 --> 30:49.967
and even the mistletoe
can't change that.

30:50.035 --> 30:53.571
And then when
you get to my age...

30:53.639 --> 30:58.042
you're so desperate
to get that magic back,

30:58.110 --> 30:59.177
you'd do anything

30:59.244 --> 31:00.845
to be able to feel

31:00.913 --> 31:04.182
how you did
that first Christmas.

31:04.249 --> 31:05.116
So what should we do?

31:07.052 --> 31:10.988
Put your scissors down,
put your watches back on.

31:11.056 --> 31:12.724
We're gonna go out
and find some people

31:12.791 --> 31:14.392
who really need
some Christmas spirit,

31:14.460 --> 31:16.994
and we are gonna sing for them.

31:17.062 --> 31:20.882
Get a good night's rest, Ken,
you're gonna need it.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.501
Barbie took the early flight
from Tampa.

31:32.644 --> 31:34.345
Santa?

31:36.048 --> 31:37.782
But it's too early.

31:37.850 --> 31:41.018
Well, you know what they say.

31:41.086 --> 31:43.121
Early's late if you make
tomorrow yesterday.

31:45.290 --> 31:46.224
Awesome.

31:46.291 --> 31:48.376
You know, Brittany,

31:48.460 --> 31:51.963
I was in the neighborhood,
doing a dry run.

31:52.030 --> 31:54.265
I have so many houses to
visit on Christmas Eve,

31:54.333 --> 31:56.334
I got to make sure it
goes off without a hitch.

31:56.401 --> 31:58.402
How about you come
sit with ol' Santy?

31:58.470 --> 32:00.371
Okay!

32:00.422 --> 32:03.141
How about you sit next
to Santy instead?

32:03.208 --> 32:04.408
Santy's just a little stinky.

32:04.476 --> 32:06.144
He needs a good ol'

32:06.211 --> 32:07.278
sponge bath from Mrs. Claus.

32:11.183 --> 32:14.018
Brittany, do you remember what
you asked me for for Christmas?

32:14.086 --> 32:16.654
Yeah, I asked for Artie
to be able to walk.

32:19.892 --> 32:21.993
Is there anything else
that you want?

32:22.060 --> 32:22.994
I mean, like, anything?

32:23.061 --> 32:24.428
No.

32:24.496 --> 32:27.665
Well, see,
Santa's trying his best,

32:27.733 --> 32:29.967
but that one's
a little hard.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.537
But you're magic.

32:32.604 --> 32:34.472
Sometimes what Santa
wants to give

32:34.540 --> 32:36.607
a good girl like you is patience,

32:36.675 --> 32:38.109
because, believe it or not,

32:38.177 --> 32:39.844
there are even some things
that he can't manage.

32:39.912 --> 32:41.646
You know,

32:41.713 --> 32:44.582
there was a girl
a little younger than you

32:44.650 --> 32:46.217
and she was a little husky.

32:46.285 --> 32:48.786
She was always asking
Santy for the same thing:

32:48.854 --> 32:52.790
To make her look
more like the other girls.

32:52.858 --> 32:55.726
She wasn't asking to be
pretty or nothing.

32:55.794 --> 32:58.095
But she just didn't want
to stick out so much.

32:59.865 --> 33:03.734
Santa just couldn't do it.

33:03.802 --> 33:07.705
So instead Santa
gave her patience.

33:07.773 --> 33:09.373
And later on, that girl was...

33:09.441 --> 33:13.811
Was glad that Santy didn't give
her what she had asked him for.

33:13.879 --> 33:17.648
She... She put being
husky to good use.

33:17.716 --> 33:20.117
Was her name Ricki Lake?

33:20.185 --> 33:22.620
The point is...

33:22.688 --> 33:25.523
I don't think I'm going
to be able to give you

33:25.591 --> 33:27.925
what you're asking for,
even though I'd like to.

33:27.993 --> 33:30.294
- But, Santa...
- I'm sorry, pumpkin.

33:30.362 --> 33:32.363
It's... It's just not
going to happen.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.101
Aren't you going
to go up the chimney?

33:39.304 --> 33:42.940
On dry runs,
Santy uses the Isuzu.

33:59.474 --> 34:00.708
What's going on?

34:00.776 --> 34:03.377
I think I've lost
the Christmas spirit.

34:05.547 --> 34:07.148
It's Santa.

34:07.215 --> 34:08.983
I don't know if
I can tell you.

34:13.554 --> 34:15.956
I used to believe that
Santa could do anything.

34:16.076 --> 34:17.596
If Santa isn't magical,

34:17.716 --> 34:20.161
I don't even know if I
want to believe anymore.

34:20.228 --> 34:22.596
It isn't fair that you
can't walk, Artie.

34:22.664 --> 34:24.297
I feel so terrible.

34:24.366 --> 34:29.937
Hey, look at me.
I'm fine.

34:30.005 --> 34:32.706
Hey, guys, we need you
in the teachers' lounge.

34:32.774 --> 34:35.543
Mr. Shue...
Brittany's not feeling so good.

34:35.610 --> 34:36.911
Santa thing.

34:36.978 --> 34:38.612
If you don't mind,
I think I'm going

34:38.679 --> 34:40.481
to take her home,
make sure she's okay.

34:40.549 --> 34:42.416
Good idea. We'll
make do without you.

34:49.257 --> 34:52.226
Hey, uh, so we're your students.

34:52.293 --> 34:55.795
All year long you suffer
through dealing with us.

34:55.864 --> 34:58.566
I imagine having some of us
in your classes

34:58.633 --> 35:01.035
would slowly chip away at
your hopes and dreams,

35:01.103 --> 35:03.137
until the whole world just felt
like a never-ending

35:03.205 --> 35:05.873
- nightmare of pain...
- Just get to the point, Finn.

35:05.941 --> 35:08.509
Right. Uh, anyway,
we're here today

35:08.577 --> 35:09.944
to help raise money

35:10.011 --> 35:12.279
for children that have a lot
less than we do.

35:12.330 --> 35:15.349
And I know some of us
have had a hard Christmas,

35:15.417 --> 35:17.918
but what we've come to learn
is that no matter

35:17.986 --> 35:19.353
how tough things get,

35:19.421 --> 35:21.122
there isn't anything
that more Santa

35:21.189 --> 35:23.791
or a couple more jingle bells
can't cure.

35:23.859 --> 35:26.127
Well, Becky, we did it.

35:26.194 --> 35:28.996
We got all my presents back.

35:29.064 --> 35:31.065
And as satisfying
as it is to have been

35:31.133 --> 35:33.968
gifted enough rotisserie ovens
to roast an entire hobo...

35:34.035 --> 35:37.438
For me,
the real joy of Christmas

35:37.506 --> 35:39.607
was breaking the collective
heart of the Glee Club.

35:43.678 --> 35:47.348

Christmas came anyway, Coach.

37:26.147 --> 37:28.883
It's beautiful.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.520
It is.

37:45.734 --> 37:46.867
How much did we raise?

37:46.935 --> 37:48.468
210 bucks.

37:48.520 --> 37:49.870
And that's after my cut.

37:49.938 --> 37:51.171
I'm kidding.

37:51.239 --> 37:52.273
Now that you're divorced

37:52.324 --> 37:53.807
and Ms. Pillsbury
married another guy,

37:53.875 --> 37:55.709
I guess you'll be spending
Christmas Eve alone.

37:55.777 --> 37:57.144
Yes, Rachel, I am.

37:57.212 --> 37:59.713
Well, I know how painful
being alone can feel,

37:59.781 --> 38:02.182
so if you want,
you can come over to my house.

38:02.250 --> 38:04.184
We're going to eat Chinese
and watch <i>The Main Event</i>.

38:04.252 --> 38:06.670
Thanks, Rachel.
I think I'm going to pass.

38:06.755 --> 38:08.589
Nothing wrong
with being alone.

38:16.798 --> 38:18.599
Artie.

38:25.407 --> 38:27.775
It's called a ReWalk.

38:27.842 --> 38:30.244
Some guy in Israel
invented it.

38:30.312 --> 38:33.080
I can't use it
all the time, but...

38:33.148 --> 38:34.982
Check me out.

38:53.068 --> 38:55.069
Where did you get it?

38:55.136 --> 38:59.640
We went home and it was
sitting under my Christmas tree.

38:59.708 --> 39:01.225
How the hell did you
afford that thing?

39:01.309 --> 39:02.176
I didn't buy it.

39:02.243 --> 39:03.610
I didn't know what it was.

39:03.678 --> 39:05.245
I thought it was
a Transformer.

39:05.313 --> 39:07.548
I assumed her dad
got it for me,

39:07.615 --> 39:10.184
but he has no idea
where it came from.

39:10.251 --> 39:12.086
He went to take
a long poop, and when

39:12.153 --> 39:13.821
he came back it was there.

39:13.888 --> 39:15.489
So if no one we know
bought it for you, then...

39:15.557 --> 39:17.057
Santa brought it.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.427
Santa.

39:20.495 --> 39:22.363
Santa.

39:24.933 --> 39:26.600
A real Christmas miracle.

40:17.919 --> 40:19.887
Hey, Will.

40:22.290 --> 40:24.358
How...How did you get in here?

40:24.426 --> 40:25.926
Oh, I had a key made
ages ago.

40:26.995 --> 40:28.295
How do you like your tree?

40:30.365 --> 40:32.800
Uh, it's... It's...
It's beautiful.

40:32.867 --> 40:35.335
Wh... What's going on?
What's with all the presents?

40:35.403 --> 40:37.571
Well, you remember that
old meanie who stole

40:37.639 --> 40:39.606
all that stuff out
of the choir room?

40:39.674 --> 40:42.476
Well, she's sorry.

40:42.544 --> 40:44.678
Really?

40:44.746 --> 40:47.414
And what made her
change her mind?

40:47.482 --> 40:48.982
I don't know.

40:49.050 --> 40:50.951
Call it a Christmas miracle
and we'll leave it at that.

40:51.002 --> 40:54.621
Now I know a lot of these gifts
are for orphans or something,

40:54.689 --> 40:58.025
but, uh... I got you
something special.

40:58.093 --> 40:59.593
It's okay, it's not
going to explode.

41:05.333 --> 41:08.602
I thought you might want to put
all of us out of our misery

41:08.670 --> 41:10.137
and shave off that Chia Pet.

41:13.341 --> 41:15.175
Thanks, Sue.

41:15.243 --> 41:17.111
The tree really does look great.

41:17.178 --> 41:19.313
Well, Santa had some helpers.

41:24.185 --> 41:27.688
No one should be alone
on Christmas Eve, Mr. Schuester.

41:27.755 --> 41:30.057
Too much talking, lady,
not enough trimming.

41:30.125 --> 41:33.026
Come on, let's get some
Christmas up in here.

41:36.264 --> 41:38.432
I thought you
hated the holidays.

41:40.935 --> 41:42.703
No, I just hate you.

41:50.311 --> 41:52.479
Merry Christmas, Sue.

41:52.547 --> 41:54.515
Merry Christmas, Will.
