<i> In the previous</i>
<i> Bat-adventure we saw</i>

00:10.676 --> 00:12.209
<i> a prime minister's</i>
<i> exploding cake</i>

00:13.011 --> 00:18.214
<i> with a puzzling message</i>
<i> from that rascal, The Riddler.</i>

00:18.750 --> 00:20.917
<i> The Dynamic Duo..</i>

00:20.919 --> 00:23.520
<i> ...pinned The Riddler's</i>
<i> ears back.</i>

00:23.522 --> 00:25.855
<i> But he tricked them..</i>

00:25.991 --> 00:29.993
<i> with a million dollar lawsuit</i>
<i> against Batman.</i>

00:30.796 --> 00:33.263
<i> Glee for The Riddler.</i>

00:33.865 --> 00:36.233
<i> Gloom for Batman.</i>

00:36.401 --> 00:38.368
<i> But then, a fresh clue</i>

00:38.370 --> 00:42.239
<i> which led Batman</i>
<i> into a Batusi trap.</i>

00:42.841 --> 00:45.242
<i> Which laid him low.</i>

00:45.544 --> 00:48.745
<i> And then Robin got it,</i>
<i> in the arm.</i>

00:48.747 --> 00:51.748
<i> The Riddler had it made.</i>

00:51.750 --> 00:53.783
<i> Gotham City was aghast.</i>

00:53.785 --> 00:55.752
<i> Robin seemed utterly doomed.</i>

00:56.554 --> 00:59.756

<i> Comes the dawn.</i>

02:05.525 --> 02:10.061
<i> A bright, shining dawn</i>
<i> over stately Wayne Manor.</i>

02:10.062 --> 02:13.564
<i> But in the depths</i>
<i> of the secret Bat-cave</i>

02:13.566 --> 02:15.066
<i> no birds sing.</i>

02:15.068 --> 02:16.934
Robin, repeat.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.503
Your homing transmitter..

02:20.073 --> 02:21.605
...turn it on, boy.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.576
- Yes.
- It's Mrs. Cooper, sir.

02:25.578 --> 02:28.112
She's noticed
your beds weren't slept in.

02:28.114 --> 02:28.979
She's having a fit.

02:28.981 --> 02:31.449
Tell her that Dick and I
are spending the night

02:31.451 --> 02:35.086
at my uncle's house.
That should put her at ease.

02:35.088 --> 02:36.721
Very good, sir.

02:50.903 --> 02:56.941
I must say, this youth's face
makes an excellent impression.

02:58.411 --> 03:01.145
You sure are a card, Riddler.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.450
Yes, my pretty.

03:06.452 --> 03:10.921
In this little game,
I...am the ace of trump.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.493
Make a positive
from instant Compound X

03:15.495 --> 03:19.430
then get into your outfit
while I bait the Bat-trap.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.544
Where am I?

03:33.546 --> 03:34.545
Where's..

03:34.547 --> 03:36.080
- Riddler!
- 'Mm-hmm.'

03:36.082 --> 03:37.782
You fiend!

03:38.017 --> 03:39.049
What's the meaning of this?

03:39.051 --> 03:40.751
- Where is Batman?
- Hanging.

03:40.753 --> 03:42.920
- What?
- Hanging by his phone, I hope.

03:43.322 --> 03:46.323
Call him, get him through
police headquarters

03:46.325 --> 03:47.357
on that famous hotline.

03:47.359 --> 03:51.295
I wish to pose him
another amusing problem.

03:51.297 --> 03:52.362
You've flipped your lid.

03:52.364 --> 03:56.233
You think I'm gonna help you
in some rotten criminal scheme?

03:57.003 --> 03:57.868
You're scared.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.237
You're really scared
that I'll outwit

04:00.239 --> 04:03.307
your Batman yet again. Alright.

04:03.309 --> 04:07.177
It'll be a cold day in August
when we're scared of you!

04:07.179 --> 04:09.880
Give me that telephone.

04:12.218 --> 04:15.819
- 'Commissioner, this is Robin.'
- Robin? Where are you?

04:15.821 --> 04:17.721
We tried the signal.
Are you alright?

04:17.723 --> 04:19.723
Can you plug me
into the hotline?

04:19.725 --> 04:21.926
Yes, of course. Hold on.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.766
Operator, plug 0-3
into the Bat-line.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.168
Trace it. Record it.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.544
- Yes.
- 'Batman, it's Robin.'

04:40.546 --> 04:42.246
Robin, old chum.
Where are you?

04:42.248 --> 04:45.916
Ho ho, ha ha.
Remember me, old chum?

04:45.918 --> 04:47.651
You jolly devil.

04:47.653 --> 04:49.854
Harm one hair
of that boy's head--

04:49.856 --> 04:50.888
Riddle me twice, Batman.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.057
What kind of pins
are used in soup?

04:53.059 --> 04:55.860
- Terrapins, Batman.
- Right.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.495
Very good.

04:57.497 --> 05:00.631
What was Joan of Arc made of?

05:00.633 --> 05:02.600
Joan of Arc was..

05:02.602 --> 05:03.767
Maid of Orleans.

05:03.769 --> 05:06.604
That's where you'll find him.

05:06.606 --> 05:07.738
Happy hunting.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.940
Don't fall for it, Batman.
It sounds too easy.

05:09.942 --> 05:14.245
I'll get out of this myself
the same way I got in.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.719
Robin. Robin!

05:21.721 --> 05:23.053
'Robin!'

05:27.727 --> 05:29.460
Terrapins.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.795
Orleans.

05:30.797 --> 05:31.662
Of course.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.899
The old turtle mill
at Orleans Cove.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.657
Riddler, you fiend.

06:02.061 --> 06:05.529
Fantastic, pretty lady.

06:19.579 --> 06:21.712
Uncanny!

06:27.653 --> 06:30.821
Don the belt.
Onto the Bat-hunt.

06:51.711 --> 06:54.245
Turn on
the homing transmitter.

06:57.149 --> 06:58.816
Done.

07:24.310 --> 07:27.945
Hold on, old fellow.
I'm getting you.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.874
I don't believe it.
It didn't happen.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.742
Shut up. Tighten seatbelt.
Don crash helmet.

07:58.744 --> 08:02.012
He'll give us the Bat-ray
any moment now.

08:26.305 --> 08:26.971
Perfect.

08:26.973 --> 08:29.773
The Bat-ray's
conked our ignition.

08:29.775 --> 08:32.842
Hold tight. Here we go.

09:13.252 --> 09:14.785
Robin.

09:17.857 --> 09:18.822
Robin.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.027
What's he done to you?

09:23.763 --> 09:28.098
I get it. The
affected your vocal cords, eh?

09:28.300 --> 09:30.834
Take it easy, old fella.
Don't try to talk.

09:30.836 --> 09:34.371
We'll have you fixed up
in no time at all.

10:07.206 --> 10:10.741
Don't move. I'll get the
universal drug antidote.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.911
Reach, Batman.

10:15.414 --> 10:16.146
Well, Molly.

10:16.548 --> 10:19.116
I was wondering
when you'd get around to that.

10:19.118 --> 10:23.453
'What? You mean you saw
through my disguise?'

10:23.455 --> 10:26.223
A criminal always
makes one mistake, Molly.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.525
Those straws you gave Robin
to breathe through

10:28.527 --> 10:31.862
I spotted the defect
in the mask instantly.

10:32.197 --> 10:34.397
That was the one hole
in your plan.

10:34.399 --> 10:38.368
Well, there are gonna be
some holes in you, Batman.

10:40.839 --> 10:42.806
Foolish girl.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.342
You were so bent
on your murderous scheme

10:45.344 --> 10:46.243
you failed to notice.

10:46.245 --> 10:50.413
In the Batmobile...I burned off
your revolver's firing pin

10:50.415 --> 10:53.316
'with a hidden Bat-laser beam.'

10:55.287 --> 10:56.620
Molly.

10:58.624 --> 10:59.890
Molly, stop.

10:59.892 --> 11:01.691
You're climbing
into the Batmobile's

11:01.693 --> 11:04.361
nuclear power source.

11:07.699 --> 11:09.699
Ah!

11:11.336 --> 11:13.603
Help!

11:13.605 --> 11:14.237
Help!

11:14.239 --> 11:17.941
Stay where you are, Molly.
Don't move a muscle.

11:17.943 --> 11:20.710
I'll come and get you.

11:36.461 --> 11:38.395
Wait, Molly.

11:45.704 --> 11:46.903
Molly.

11:46.905 --> 11:48.838
Don't panic.

11:51.276 --> 11:52.342
Reach, Molly.

11:52.344 --> 11:55.812
I can't. I'm-I'm too scared.

11:59.484 --> 12:02.519
I'm slipping. Oh, Batman!

12:08.327 --> 12:10.727
Poor, deluded girl.

12:10.729 --> 12:13.863
If only she'd have
let me save her.

12:16.301 --> 12:19.502
What a terrible way to go.

12:21.940 --> 12:25.508
'Don't fall for it, Batman.
It sounds too easy.'

12:25.510 --> 12:30.513
'I'll get out of this myself,
the same way I got in.'

12:32.150 --> 12:35.384
Hopeless. Broke off before
we could make the trace.

12:35.386 --> 12:36.619
It's not even a good recording.

12:36.621 --> 12:39.022
All those
devilish rumbling noises.

12:39.024 --> 12:39.656
You're wrong, chief.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.325
Those noises
are our salvation.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.960
What?
Those noises?

12:42.962 --> 12:43.694
Subway trains, commissioner.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.996
Quick, get me a timing
on this tape

12:45.998 --> 12:48.498
and a complete set
of subway schedules.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.467
The Batmobile
will do the rest.

12:50.469 --> 12:52.002
Right.

12:56.441 --> 12:58.508
Mother of mercy!
What's it doing now?

12:58.910 --> 13:01.878
Checking with the main computer
in the Bat-cave.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.681
Automatic radio link.

13:09.120 --> 13:12.388
The answer should be back
any second now.

13:17.028 --> 13:19.062
10th street line,
Coolidge Square Station.

13:19.064 --> 13:22.465
Commissioner, phone ahead.
Have them clear the platforms.

13:22.467 --> 13:24.000
Right.

13:24.269 --> 13:26.469
- Hi, Batman.
- Hi.

14:03.808 --> 14:05.408
Molly should've
been back by now

14:05.410 --> 14:09.112
with Batman's scalp.
I wonder what went awry?

14:09.114 --> 14:10.947
You went awry, Riddler.

14:10.949 --> 14:11.380
Years ago.

14:11.382 --> 14:14.417
Don't you know
that crime never pays.

14:18.990 --> 14:20.890
Ha ha ha.

14:21.292 --> 14:23.893
Ho ho ho.

14:23.895 --> 14:24.894
He he he.

14:27.832 --> 14:29.098
Holy smoke.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.834
Surrender, you rat.

14:40.044 --> 14:41.210
What's that?

14:41.212 --> 14:45.448
Holy showcase.
A sheet of bulletproof glass.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.320
Batman, listen.
Don't look so blue.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.255
Their final caper
is set for tonight.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.626
- And I know what it is.
- What do you know?

15:28.628 --> 15:29.159
I played possum.

15:29.161 --> 15:31.829
I heard The Riddler
making up some tricky clues.

15:31.831 --> 15:35.165
Listen. How many sides
is a circle?

15:35.835 --> 15:36.900
Answer, two.

15:36.902 --> 15:39.670
- Inside and outside. Right?
- Right.

15:39.672 --> 15:40.704
Here's the second one.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.840
What President
of the United States

15:42.842 --> 15:44.975
wore the biggest hat?

15:46.646 --> 15:47.845
It's-it's easy, Batman.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.748
- The one with the biggest head.
- 'Of course.'

15:50.750 --> 15:53.350
Don't you see what they mean?
Biggest head.

15:53.352 --> 15:56.120
That's gotta be the famous
skyscraper head office

15:56.122 --> 15:58.088
of the Gotham City
National Bank.

15:58.090 --> 16:02.326
The Riddler's gonna go inside
and cart the loot outside.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.327
Well, well.

16:03.329 --> 16:07.798
We've come a long way from the
prime minister's exploding cake.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.300
Or have we?

16:11.103 --> 16:12.436
Nice listening, Robin.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.372
Aw, gee, it was nothin', Batman.

16:15.374 --> 16:16.940
Well, what are we waiting for?

16:16.942 --> 16:20.344
Let's call Commissioner Gordon
and wrap this up.

16:24.450 --> 16:27.785
<i> And now, even as the fearless</i>
<i> minions of the law</i>

16:27.787 --> 16:33.190
<i> converge on the head office of</i>
<i> the Gotham City National Bank..</i>

16:34.694 --> 16:36.960
<i> ...miles away,</i>
<i> The Riddler and his gang</i>

16:36.962 --> 16:40.230
<i> are about to come up</i>
<i> under the Moldavian Pavilion</i>

16:40.232 --> 16:42.332
<i> at the Gotham City</i>
<i> World's Fair.</i>

16:42.334 --> 16:46.904
<i> Holy red snapper.</i>
<i> Has Batman goofed?</i>

16:55.414 --> 16:59.149
But it's so utterly fabulous,
Your Excellency.

16:59.151 --> 17:00.818
It's simply too much.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.987
It's famous mammoth
of Moldavia, dear lady.

17:03.989 --> 17:07.124
Found in ice
many centuries ago.

17:07.126 --> 17:11.161
Worshiped by the peoples
of my country.

17:11.864 --> 17:15.398
Notice priceless jewels
in eyes and elsewhere.

17:15.401 --> 17:20.204
Beast is stuffed exclusively
with used postage stamps

17:20.205 --> 17:23.840
from ancient kingdom
of Moldavia.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.142
Very cheap stuffing then

17:25.144 --> 17:30.848
but now, worth unspeakable
fortune to stamp collectors.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.249
Ah.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.535
All hooked up, chief.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.441
The air vent to the pavilion.

18:09.121 --> 18:11.155
Turn them on.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.176
Wait for my signal.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.457
Good evening, my friends.
One and all.

18:47.459 --> 18:51.361
Ha ha. Hello, hello, hello.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.897
He-ello.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.199
...what is that?

18:55.201 --> 18:58.101
It appears to be a vulgar,
low comedian.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.938
Has anybody seen
my friend, The Curse?

19:00.940 --> 19:01.872
Curse who?

19:01.874 --> 19:03.241
<i> Gesundheit.</i>

19:09.649 --> 19:12.550
Oh, I see. Curse who?

19:12.552 --> 19:13.651
<i> Gesundheit.</i>

19:13.653 --> 19:15.519
Oh, that's delightful!

19:25.031 --> 19:27.031
Did you hear about Greta Garbo?

19:27.033 --> 19:29.500
She dreamed one night
she sprinkled

19:29.502 --> 19:31.869
six boxes of
grass seed in her hair

19:31.871 --> 19:36.674
and woke up moaning,
"I vant to be a lawn."

19:39.345 --> 19:42.480
I can't bear it, darling.

19:59.565 --> 20:02.466
Easy, my friend.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.576
That's the signal.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.597
Quickly, boys. Quickly.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.265
Move quickly. Quick.

20:34.267 --> 20:37.768
That it. Move those cups
out of the way.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.702
Get your cables set.

20:38.704 --> 20:43.274
Rig your hoist and bring
that mammoth to the hole.

20:44.544 --> 20:48.178
Faster, faster, faster.
We can't wait all night.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.182
'This joke's on you, Riddler.'

20:52.184 --> 20:54.919
When's a donkey spelled
with one letter?

20:54.921 --> 20:55.886
When it's 'U.'

20:55.888 --> 20:59.189
A Trojan mammoth. Oh.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.058
Thought we were
at the bank, huh?

21:01.060 --> 21:02.326
The police went
there as a ruse.

21:02.328 --> 21:05.696
I had your clues wrong
but Batman solved them.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.064
The biggest head.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.867
The fabulous mammoth
of Moldavia.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.101
With jewels on the outside

21:11.103 --> 21:14.905
and priceless
postage stamps inside.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.007
Get them, boys.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.010
Get them or it's curtains.

22:03.122 --> 22:07.191
The Riddler, watch him.
He's running for the rathole.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.863
Back, Batman. Back.

22:14.367 --> 22:17.968
If this gas ignites,
it'll blow you to kingdom come.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.004
You venal viper.

22:40.861 --> 22:42.694
Case dismissed, sir?

22:42.696 --> 22:45.697
You mean The Riddler's
lawsuit against Batman?

22:45.699 --> 22:46.965
Precisely, Master Dick.

22:46.967 --> 22:49.267
According to the report
on the wireless

22:49.269 --> 22:53.672
the plaintiff...
failed to appear.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.206
I wonder.

22:56.043 --> 22:59.578
Got him, Bruce.
The blast of that laughing gas.

22:59.580 --> 23:02.280
- It must have got him.
- Who knows, Dick?

23:02.282 --> 23:03.682
The police never found a body.

23:03.684 --> 23:07.085
The Prince of Puzzlers may well
have escaped underground

23:07.087 --> 23:09.087
to baffle us another day.

23:09.089 --> 23:11.590
That means...we failed?

23:11.758 --> 23:13.224
No, Dick. No.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.993
Don't say that.

23:14.995 --> 23:16.795
The Molehill Mob in jail

23:16.797 --> 23:18.797
the mammoth of Moldavia
is saved.

23:18.799 --> 23:21.833
If it hadn't been for us,
the theft of that behemoth

23:21.835 --> 23:24.235
could've led to an ugly
international incident.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.605
When you put it
that way, Bruce

23:26.607 --> 23:28.974
yes, I see you're right.

23:30.877 --> 23:34.646
I have only one regret
in the whole affair.

23:34.648 --> 23:37.983
One thing
that makes me heartsick.

23:38.752 --> 23:39.951
Molly?

23:39.953 --> 23:42.053
You kinda liked her,
didn't you?

23:42.055 --> 23:43.955
If only I could've
helped her somehow.

23:43.957 --> 23:47.826
Weaned her from that tragic
alliance with the underworld

23:47.828 --> 23:49.794
'which led to..'

23:49.796 --> 23:51.029
Dear me, Bruce.

23:51.031 --> 23:55.000
I hope you're not speaking
of any young lady we know.

23:55.002 --> 23:58.036
I mean, the thought
of Dick being exposed

23:58.038 --> 24:00.271
to any criminal element is..

24:00.273 --> 24:02.674
Rest at ease, Aunt Harriet.

24:02.676 --> 24:04.242
The young lady won't trouble us.

24:04.244 --> 24:08.246
She's merely someone I pass
like a ship in the night.

24:08.248 --> 24:11.182
Now vanished
like a puff of smoke.

24:16.823 --> 24:17.255
Dick.

24:17.257 --> 24:19.357
Like some help
with that algebra?

24:19.359 --> 24:22.060
Sure would, Bruce.
