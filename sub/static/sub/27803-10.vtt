00:04.080 --> 00:05.707
[Xander]
Previously on Siren.

00:05.710 --> 00:06.950
[Ben] I'll call
the Coast Guard, okay?

00:06.960 --> 00:08.109
[Xander] No, no! Don't.

00:08.120 --> 00:09.826
Man, why
didn't we call them?

00:09.830 --> 00:10.910
Why'd you let it burn?

00:10.920 --> 00:12.069
Something on your mind?

00:12.080 --> 00:14.207
Thinking about my sister.

00:14.210 --> 00:17.452
I'm sure Rick's told you
he and I don't always see

00:17.460 --> 00:18.870
eye to eye.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.110
There's a woman
looking for you.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.496
She's with the military.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.036
Yes. I help her.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.326
It's Mom.
She's in the emergency room.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.116
What happened?

00:28.120 --> 00:29.872
It's that_clinica| trial
that doctor Signed her up for.

00:29.880 --> 00:30.869
Aldon Decker?

00:30.880 --> 00:31.869
I wanted to talk to you

00:31.880 --> 00:33.074
about Decker's research.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.115
He did a whole study

00:34.120 --> 00:35.747
on curing paralytic rats
with stem cells.

00:35.750 --> 00:37.991
If you could do something
to help Mom,

00:38.000 --> 00:39.115
wouldn't you take the chance?

00:39.120 --> 00:40.781
Got your text. What's up?

00:40.790 --> 00:42.746
We need to talk.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.071
Unh! Aah!

00:45.080 --> 00:46.786
Thank you for bringing
them back, Bryan.

00:46.790 --> 00:48.075
-Of course.
-[He|en] Let us out!

00:48.080 --> 00:49.286
I'll gather the others.

01:04.580 --> 01:07.037

[fans humming]

01:37.670 --> 01:40.207
[camera clicking]

01:43.040 --> 01:45.952
Do all these people
really need to be here?

01:45.960 --> 01:47.325
She's not a zoo exhibit.

01:47.330 --> 01:48.285
These are our orders.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.871
[screaming]

01:51.880 --> 01:54.610
[groaning]

01:57.540 --> 02:00.247

02:00.250 --> 02:02.957

02:02.960 --> 02:05.497
-Aah!

[screams continue]

02:27.000 --> 02:28.661
[screaming]

02:31.210 --> 02:34.373
No. We're getting her
out of here. Now.

02:36.880 --> 02:37.949
Enough!

02:37.960 --> 02:39.996
[Ryn gasping]

02:41.250 --> 02:42.239
That's enough.
Get back.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.376
[Maddie] Here.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.742
[panﬁng]

02:50.250 --> 02:53.822
[high-pitched call]

02:53.830 --> 02:57.209
Ryn, if it's too much,
we can make them stop.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.780
Tell them you
changed your mind.

03:00.210 --> 03:01.950
This will help
Ben's mother?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.450
We hope so, yes.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.915
Not too much.

03:08.580 --> 03:09.956
Let us out!

03:11.080 --> 03:12.741
[lock clicking]

03:14.380 --> 03:15.665
Beth?

03:15.670 --> 03:17.535
What_ the hell's
gomg on?

03:17.540 --> 03:18.746
[Rick] Where are we?

03:18.750 --> 03:20.741
Riclq, I'm so sorry.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.286
This is Bryan's house.

03:30.330 --> 03:31.661
[exhales]

03:31.670 --> 03:33.160
Rick, come on. Let's go.

03:33.170 --> 03:35.240
[Beth] Please, Helen.
Have a seat.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.457
Riclq, you too.

03:37.460 --> 03:40.372
No way.
The last time you sat me
down with some stranger,

03:40.380 --> 03:41.495
we took a ride
to Bellfield.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.569
That's not
happening again.

03:42.580 --> 03:44.070
I'm not taking you anywhere.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.456
I'm not crazy.

03:45.460 --> 03:46.700
She has nothing
to do with this,

03:46.710 --> 03:48.166
so just let her go.

03:48.170 --> 03:51.242
I agree.
You're not crazy.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.377
But I'm sorry.
We can't let you go.

03:53.380 --> 03:54.699
Then what's this all about?

03:54.710 --> 03:56.575
I'm very sorry
we scared you.

03:56.580 --> 03:59.208
We've never had
a situation like this before.

04:01.580 --> 04:04.708
There are things
you need to know.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.786
[Nicole]
They were the first group

04:08.790 --> 04:10.246
to _receive
Ryn's Sister's cells.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.456
[squeaking]

04:11.460 --> 04:14.076
Yeah. The lucky ones.

04:14.080 --> 04:17.459
Rats who didn't
get the cells
didn't fare as well.

04:17.460 --> 04:18.449
All of them died.

04:18.460 --> 04:20.200
Their paralysis
was progressive.

04:20.210 --> 04:22.997
Which is
almost always fatal.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.319
You know a lot
about this stuff.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.911
Yeah. Unfortunately.

04:25.920 --> 04:29.287
Look, the notes in here
talk about upcoming research.

04:29.290 --> 04:31.326
Where is
the upcoming research?

04:31.330 --> 04:34.822
Decker was distracted
with Ryn's sister.

04:34.830 --> 04:37.037
His documentation became...

04:37.040 --> 04:38.416
a bit disjointed.

04:38.420 --> 04:42.322
Is there any record
of what he was planning next?

04:42.330 --> 04:44.491
Decker died
before he could move forward,

04:44.500 --> 04:47.071
but his plan was
for these wounded soldiers

04:47.080 --> 04:49.878
to be his first
human test subjects.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.371
So the research was
far enough along

04:52.380 --> 04:54.166
that they were
thinking about people?

04:54.170 --> 04:55.159
Mm-hmm.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.617
Ben's mother can't walk
like these people.

05:04.620 --> 05:05.951
Yeah.

05:07.170 --> 05:08.285
When could this happen?

05:08.290 --> 05:10.702
Well, the fast track version

05:10.710 --> 05:13.873
would be to replicate
the study in another lab.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.372
After that, we could be
working with these guys
in six months.

05:18.670 --> 05:21.070
When does
the next study start?

05:22.420 --> 05:24.456
Notunﬁl
we have more stem cells.

05:24.460 --> 05:27.076
There are none left?

05:27.080 --> 05:28.240
But now we have
another source.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.410
We could harvest more.

05:31.420 --> 05:34.241
-From Ryn?
-Absolutely not.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.879
We agreed Ryn would do
observational studies,
not experiments.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.371
Her sister was traumatized
by that procedure.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.610
We learned from that,
and we'd do it
differently this time.

05:42.620 --> 05:44.451
With anesthesia.
No pain.

05:44.460 --> 05:47.247
Doctors don't even know
how anestheSIa works In humans.

05:50.170 --> 05:52.320
Well, then I guess we'll be
taking things a lot slower.

05:58.290 --> 06:00.451
Why cannot
take Ryn's cells?

06:00.460 --> 06:03.281
Because the procedure
could hurt you.

06:03.290 --> 06:04.996
We don't know
what it'll do to you.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.878
You've been through
too much already, Ryn.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.108
[cell phone ringing]

06:09.120 --> 06:11.577
Shit. It's the hospital.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.457
This is Ben.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.576
[woman]
Ben, it's Dr. Park.

06:15.580 --> 06:17.536
I was just visiting
your mother.

06:17.540 --> 06:18.916
Yeah, how is she?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.707
Unfortunately, her condition
is deteriorating

06:21.710 --> 06:23.371
faster than we hoped.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.325
She lost the use
of her right hand

06:25.330 --> 06:26.911
in the last few hours.

06:29.500 --> 06:33.539
Ben, sometimes patients
decline very quickly from here.

06:33.540 --> 06:37.419
You might want to alert
any family members
who'd like to see her.

06:41.580 --> 06:44.378
Yeah, I'll--
I'll be right over.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.529
[phone beeps]

06:45.540 --> 06:47.496
[seagulls calling]

06:47.500 --> 06:51.163
[rock ballad playing in bar]

06:51.170 --> 06:53.616
Seventy-four bucks
for two days?

06:53.620 --> 06:55.417
It's barely beer money.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.786
Well, some people live to work.

06:57.790 --> 06:59.610
Others work to drink.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.531
And others get to spend
the rest of their lives

07:01.540 --> 07:02.575
on their Mom's couch
'cause they can't pay rent.

07:02.580 --> 07:03.956
You know what?

07:03.960 --> 07:05.416
You gotta stop
serving alcohol.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.706
Start serving
the customers.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.411
Just saying. It works.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.489
Okay.

07:14.620 --> 07:15.917
Hi, baby.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.456
Mwah.

07:17.460 --> 07:18.700
Okay, if you're angling
for more freebies,

07:18.710 --> 07:20.450
you're gonna start
getting me in trouble.

07:20.460 --> 07:22.917
Huh. Stack of pancakes

07:22.920 --> 07:24.740
and whatever my friend
over there's having.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.537
Now, where did you get
all that cash?

07:27.540 --> 07:30.612
Baby, never look
a gift horse in the mouth.

07:30.620 --> 07:32.872
Ah. Is that what we're calling
you paying your tab now?

07:32.880 --> 07:34.324
A gift?

07:35.500 --> 07:36.910
Hey, yo, _
you get a new gig?

07:36.920 --> 07:39.036
Just some odd jobs
here and there.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.531
God bless TaskRabbit, right?

07:41.540 --> 07:44.452
That's cool.
Good for you, man.

07:44.460 --> 07:47.111
I'm so sorry I couldn't
tell you back at my house.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.667
Tell us what?

07:48.670 --> 07:51.821
I've wanted to
for such a long time.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.115
She already knew.

07:54.920 --> 07:55.955
I don't understand.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.746
I'm sorry, Ricky.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.708
There were reasons
I couldn't tell you
the truth.

08:00.710 --> 08:02.109
And who are you?

08:02.120 --> 08:04.611
Bryan's one of us.
You can trust him.

08:04.620 --> 08:07.282
I'll decide
who I can trust, thanks.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.240
So how did you two
get together?

08:10.250 --> 08:12.741
Our families go back.
150 years.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.456
The Pownall Massacre.

08:14.460 --> 08:18.578
Our great-great-grandparents
were survivors.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.662
They lived on land,
with humans.

08:20.670 --> 08:22.570
With humans, where?

08:22.580 --> 08:24.411
In and around Bristol Cove.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.285
They went into hiding.

08:26.290 --> 08:27.609
How do you
know all of this?

08:27.620 --> 08:30.953
We've kept their ways--
and our ways-- alive,

08:30.960 --> 08:32.700
in secret, ever since.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.951
This is insane.

08:34.960 --> 08:39.579
We have to all agree
to share this with anyone new.

08:41.460 --> 08:46.284
So, how many of us
are there?

08:49.830 --> 08:51.457
Ben is sad.

08:51.460 --> 08:54.111
He's worried about his mom.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.452
She's very sick,
and it's getting worse.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.740
How did she get sick?

09:00.580 --> 09:02.036
She was hurt
in a boating accident

09:02.040 --> 09:04.918
when Ben and I
were teenagers.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.909
I hardly even
knew him then,

09:05.920 --> 09:08.411
but we all knew
hIS story.

09:08.420 --> 09:10.069
Ben was sad then, too?

09:10.080 --> 09:12.787
He_ wouldn't leave
his mom's Side.

09:12.790 --> 09:15.782
For a while, he stopped
seeing all his friends.

09:15.790 --> 09:17.530
Stopped everything.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.576
Why he stop everything?

09:19.580 --> 09:21.377
He was afraid
she would die.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.377
She will die now?

09:28.620 --> 09:30.611
I-- I don't know.

09:30.620 --> 09:32.201
Ben's trying to help,

09:32.210 --> 09:33.996
but we just don't know
if there's time.

09:35.330 --> 09:36.740
Will you be okay here?

09:36.750 --> 09:38.206
I hate to leave,
but I'm so late for work.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.780
Yes. I will sleep.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.614
There's food in the fridge.

09:43.620 --> 09:44.996
I'll be back soon.

09:48.540 --> 09:50.371
You sure
that you're comfortable?

09:50.380 --> 09:51.916
[laughs]

09:51.920 --> 09:54.377
These doctors are making
a bigger deal than they need to.

09:56.420 --> 09:58.661
What about your other hand?

09:58.670 --> 10:00.376
They said
it's affected now, too.

10:01.420 --> 10:02.910
No, I--

10:02.920 --> 10:04.740
I just think
it's bad circulation.

10:04.750 --> 10:08.242
And lying in this bed all day
is not helping anything.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.030
You talk
to Dad and Doug?

10:16.040 --> 10:19.248
They're flying home after they
meet the specialist at Hopkins.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.662
I should've
gone with them.

10:21.670 --> 10:23.661
-[gasp51
-Hey, hey.

10:23.670 --> 10:25.376
Mom, Mom, Mom, hey.

10:27.620 --> 10:30.168
-I'm sorry. I just...
-No. No, Mom.

10:35.380 --> 10:36.495
We'll find something.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.030
A new trial.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.074
I think...

10:44.420 --> 10:46.661
it's _time _ _
to start being realistic.

10:58.670 --> 11:00.069
Ryn.

11:00.670 --> 11:02.410
Where are Ben and Maddie?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.872
I come alone.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.666
To help Ben's mother.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.536
We're going
to give you something
to make this less painful.

11:12.540 --> 11:14.371
One quick pinch
is all you'll feel.

11:17.170 --> 11:18.376
We're ready.

11:18.380 --> 11:20.075
You sure about this?

11:20.080 --> 11:22.287
Yes. Sure.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.166
Wait.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.070
[ringing]

11:54.080 --> 11:55.160
Hello?

11:55.170 --> 11:56.535
[Nicole] Ryn's here
at the lab with me.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.576
-What?! How did she--
-She showed up.

11:58.580 --> 12:01.162
She asked us
to do the extraction.

12:01.170 --> 12:02.159
You should come.

12:02.170 --> 12:03.285
Water!

12:03.290 --> 12:05.201
[grunting]

12:06.420 --> 12:09.116
[heart monitor beeping]

12:09.120 --> 12:11.748
Ryn? Hey.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.240
Ryn.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.740
Are you okay?

12:16.250 --> 12:18.457
I am a good driver.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.285
You didn't
have to do this.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.241
Want to help Ben's mother.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.609
Thank you.

12:36.170 --> 12:38.491
Ryn wanted to do this.
For Ben.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.037
She showed up here
on her own.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.280
Why didn't you call us?

12:42.290 --> 12:44.667
She said not to.
Said you'd try to stop it.

12:44.670 --> 12:45.955
And I have an obligation
to my commanding officer.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.496
That is your problem.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.741
And if they replace me,
it'll be yours, too.
Trust me.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.035
We had a deal.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.076
Our deal was everything
is Ryn's decision.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.456
This was.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.878
This means we can move on
With the research
for your mother.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.949
Isn't that
what you wanted?

12:59.960 --> 13:01.109
Not like this.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.166
How did you want it?

13:03.330 --> 13:04.661
You agreed to this.

13:07.540 --> 13:09.167
Look, our researchers

13:09.170 --> 13:11.991
are looking at Ryn's
stem cells as we speak.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.163
They say they're as pure
as her sister's were.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.035
Don't you want to be
a part of finding
your mother's cure?

13:21.000 --> 13:25.323
If you ever go behind
our backs again,

13:25.330 --> 13:26.570
if you ever hurt her...

13:26.580 --> 13:28.116
Nobody wants Ryn
to suffer.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.826
Trust me.
She's too valuable.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.200
Come with me.

13:32.210 --> 13:33.780
Let me show you
what she gave us.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.203
The centrifuge separates
the cells from the fluid.

13:44.290 --> 13:45.996
Are those Ryn's?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.991
[Dr. Reed] The yellow ones
are her stem cells.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.410
Once they're put
into a recipient,

13:49.420 --> 13:51.035
they become whatever
the body needs.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.203
Muscle tissue, heart tissue.
spinal tissue.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.702
So once the cells
are processed,

13:58.710 --> 14:01.201
how does the test subject
receive them?

14:01.210 --> 14:02.871
Well, we sedate them,

14:02.880 --> 14:04.950
and then administer
a spinal injection.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.279
That simple.

14:06.290 --> 14:07.450
What about in a human?

14:09.580 --> 14:11.787
Same thing, in theory.

14:11.790 --> 14:15.248
But there's a lot to study
before we get there.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.206
[Nicole] We're months away
from human testing.

14:17.210 --> 14:20.202
My mother
doesn't have months.

14:22.170 --> 14:24.570
Well, there are precedents
for expediting human research.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.247
If someone were willing
to sign away everything.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.957
Someone with nothing
to lose.

14:32.290 --> 14:33.530
There are ways.

14:36.380 --> 14:37.950
Money laundering?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.109
Please. Calvin?

14:39.120 --> 14:41.111
The man can't balance
a checkbook.

14:41.120 --> 14:45.910
Okay. So maybe
he sold his sperm?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.160
Eww. Gross.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.069
He would never.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.616
-[laughs]
-But you're right.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.576
He came home flush
again last night.

14:53.580 --> 14:55.377
He's doing
something boneheaded.

14:58.830 --> 15:01.162
You think he's dealing?

15:01.170 --> 15:02.569
He ran a little weed
in high school.

15:02.580 --> 15:04.821
Shit. He's totally
gonna get caught.

15:04.830 --> 15:06.878
And go to jail, again.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.450
You know,
if you're texting,

15:08.460 --> 15:11.031
you might
not wanna mention drugs.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.280
I'm stalking.

15:12.290 --> 15:13.951
I wanna know
who he's selling to.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.030
How? Let me see.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.530
_ Calvin loses
his phone so often,

15:17.540 --> 15:19.701
we have him
permanently authorized
on my phone finder.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.075
[Xander]
He's at the south side
of the docks?

15:23.080 --> 15:24.820
I hope he's
just selling weed.

15:24.830 --> 15:26.036
Shit.

15:27.290 --> 15:28.245
Should I go down there?

15:29.880 --> 15:31.529
Nah, that's my turf.
I'll go after work.

15:32.540 --> 15:33.871
Thanks.

15:33.880 --> 15:37.247
So Mom and Dad
were like us, too?

15:37.250 --> 15:38.569
Dad wanted to tell you.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.950
But you were so little
when Mom died.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.200
And it was hard.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.280
You were in therapy.

15:46.290 --> 15:48.167
We didn't know
if you could keep the secret.

15:48.170 --> 15:51.071
We wanted to tell you
when the time was right.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.321
Then with the drugs...

15:53.330 --> 15:54.115
[sighs]

16:00.080 --> 16:01.160
It just never came.

16:07.170 --> 16:09.035
That's my mother.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.874
Yes. A long time ago,
she was part of the group.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.416
It's before I was born.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.877
[Beth] She was
an independent spirit.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.199
Couldn't
stay in one place.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.246
That's why she left.

16:20.250 --> 16:23.413
You're too young
to have met her.

16:23.420 --> 16:27.208
Members of the group
rarely leave.

16:28.290 --> 16:30.827
When they do,
people remember.

16:30.830 --> 16:32.912
And they pass on
the stories.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.667
So did you all
know about me?

16:36.670 --> 16:39.457
There were rumors
your mother had a child.

16:39.460 --> 16:42.372
And your shop's
been on our radar.

16:42.380 --> 16:43.665
When you showed up,

16:43.670 --> 16:46.241
we pieced it together.

16:46.250 --> 16:50.243
She never told me anything
about this part of her life.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.911
I'm sure she had
good reasons.

16:54.670 --> 16:57.321
We have a gathering
planned for tomorrow.

16:58.420 --> 17:00.035
You could meet some of us.

17:01.330 --> 17:03.457
Mike and the boys
will be there.

17:03.460 --> 17:04.575
Helen?

17:07.920 --> 17:11.412
_ The cells
Will help Ben's mother?

17:13.120 --> 17:14.200
I think so.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.376
I hope so.

17:17.380 --> 17:19.325
-Are you sure?
-No, I'm not.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.207
It's never even
been tried before.

17:21.210 --> 17:22.609
What choice
do I have?

17:22.620 --> 17:24.827
Ijust...

17:24.830 --> 17:28.118
We don't know what
the complications could be.

17:28.120 --> 17:32.375
If I don't do something,
she's got no chance.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.278
[door opens]

17:36.250 --> 17:38.821
We'd like to keep Ryn
for 24 hour observation.

17:38.830 --> 17:39.910
Ryn, is that okay?

17:39.920 --> 17:41.205
Okay. Yes.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.201
We're not leaving her
here alone.

17:43.210 --> 17:44.529
I'll stay.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.781
I'll see
ifI can find a cot.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.206
I don't know how you're
holding together so well.

17:54.580 --> 17:55.956
What do you think, Xan?

17:57.080 --> 18:00.072
I mean, you know me.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.377
You know my mom.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.245
Is this just too rislq?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.660
If there was anything--

18:08.290 --> 18:11.953
anything I could've done
to save my dad, I would've.

18:11.960 --> 18:12.949
Yeah.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.109
How'd you, uh...

18:16.120 --> 18:17.826
How'd find out about
the medical stuff, aanay?

18:22.960 --> 18:24.075
Nicole.

18:26.380 --> 18:28.780
Oh. Are you kidding me?

18:30.710 --> 18:34.111
So... So, what,
you trust her now?

18:34.120 --> 18:37.499
No. But you know
how you said that
you would do anything?

18:38.880 --> 18:42.111
Well, I guess that
this is my anything.

18:48.750 --> 18:52.493
Mom, just hear me out, okay?

18:52.500 --> 18:56.994
Now, at your gala,
Dr. Decker told you
about a trial

18:57.000 --> 18:59.286
that cured paralysis
in rats.

19:00.750 --> 19:04.322
I got in touch
with the people who
he was working with.

19:04.330 --> 19:06.821
They're ready
for a human trial, Mom.

19:06.830 --> 19:08.377
You'd be their first patient.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.371
I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.701
You've helped me
for the last ten years.

19:20.330 --> 19:21.911
Ben, I'm tired.

19:21.920 --> 19:26.118
No, Mom, this is
the cutting edge
of what is possible.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.576
There are risks.

19:27.580 --> 19:30.162
I mean, I don't know
what's gonna happen.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.320
But it cured paralysis
in those rats.

19:34.330 --> 19:36.116
I saw them.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.577
If anything can save you,
this is it.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.706
Whatever time
I have left,

19:44.710 --> 19:48.202
I-- I want to spend it
with you and Dad and Doug.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.245
I'm not giving up.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.370
I'll tell her.

20:08.380 --> 20:10.200
And give your mom
a hug for me.

20:15.830 --> 20:18.879
Ben wants you to eat
for your strength.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.496
Food here taste like...

20:22.540 --> 20:23.529
[clank]

20:23.540 --> 20:24.916
...rocks.

20:24.920 --> 20:28.287
Sorry. Look, try
some of this green stuff.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.746
Hard to get that wrong.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.706
Like fish under water.

20:42.380 --> 20:45.076
Soft. Like, um...

20:47.250 --> 20:50.378
Jellyfish?
Long tentacles?

20:50.380 --> 20:53.247
Jellyfish. Okay. Yes.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.706
Sweet jellyfish.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.201
[laughing]

20:59.210 --> 21:02.498
Ben's mother
will take Ryn's cells.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.785
This worry Maddie?

21:03.790 --> 21:06.418
I hope it works.

21:06.420 --> 21:07.375
We'll see.

21:07.380 --> 21:09.200
You like her?

21:10.580 --> 21:13.663
She can be difficult.

21:13.670 --> 21:15.035
But she made Ben,

21:15.040 --> 21:18.783
and she raised him
into who he is today.

21:18.790 --> 21:20.667
A man who'd do anything
in the world for us.

21:23.460 --> 21:24.916
I hope she doesn't die.

21:26.210 --> 21:27.609
Me too.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.786
No, I'm good.

21:34.290 --> 21:35.996
Has the doctor arrived?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.456
He's just outside.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.030
He's consulting
with your team.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.280
[sighs]

21:43.290 --> 21:47.249
Stem cells_ from
a deepwater marine creature.

21:47.250 --> 21:48.911
[laughs]

21:48.920 --> 21:51.491
Can you imagine
what your father's
going to say?

21:54.500 --> 21:56.320
You haven't told him?

21:56.330 --> 21:58.821
We both know he'd try
to talk me out of it.

22:01.290 --> 22:02.325
But I want this.

22:04.170 --> 22:07.378
No matter what happens,
we never gave up.

22:09.710 --> 22:10.529
No.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.780
They're all like us?

22:21.790 --> 22:23.326
Unbelievable.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.575
What's wrong with that boy?

22:29.380 --> 22:31.530
He has _ _
a genetic condition.

22:31.540 --> 22:32.700
We deal
with our fair share.

22:34.250 --> 22:37.663
A limited gene pool
has some side effects.

22:53.380 --> 22:55.245
Hey. Sorry.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.616
We brought your mom
Jell-O.

22:57.620 --> 22:59.247
Make mother strong.

22:59.250 --> 23:02.287
Hey, if the stem cells
don't work,

23:02.290 --> 23:03.666
we can always
give this a try.

23:06.750 --> 23:10.459
Ben's mother
has Ryn inside.

23:10.460 --> 23:11.609
Yeah.

23:13.330 --> 23:15.537
She'll always
have a part of you.

23:15.540 --> 23:17.076
Pretty wild.

23:18.380 --> 23:19.779
How is she?

23:19.790 --> 23:22.372
Your mom's_ stable
and resting.

23:22.380 --> 23:24.075
I've updated
the rest of her team.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.457
They're
cautiously optimistic.

23:27.880 --> 23:30.417
Okay. So what's next?

23:30.420 --> 23:32.411
For now,
we wait and see.

23:33.790 --> 23:34.916
How are you feeling?

23:34.920 --> 23:36.956
Not tired.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.075
That's a good sign.

23:39.290 --> 23:40.450
Go home.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.200
I'll call
if there's a problem.

23:42.210 --> 23:44.701
No. I'm not gonna
leave my mom here.

23:44.710 --> 23:47.452
Let me say
this another way.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.996
Your mother needs to rest.

23:53.540 --> 23:55.952
[bell ringing]

23:55.960 --> 23:59.418
Everyone, we have
some special guests today.

23:59.420 --> 24:03.413
Say hello
to my baby brother, Rick.

24:03.420 --> 24:04.876
-[woman] Hi, Rick.
-[woman 2] Hey.

24:06.210 --> 24:09.202
And our new friend
Helen Hawkins.

24:10.460 --> 24:12.200

in grace?

[all reciting]
Sistren of tide and time,

24:20.670 --> 24:23.537
we gather in the spirit
of the Great Deep.

24:23.540 --> 24:26.452
We ask
our Mother's blessings

24:26.460 --> 24:28.610
on this bounty of sea

24:28.620 --> 24:29.666

24:29.670 --> 24:31.285
And land.

24:32.420 --> 24:33.409
Oh!

24:33.420 --> 24:35.490
My mother taught me that.

24:40.460 --> 24:41.996
Halibut or shrimp?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.036
What goes well
with a bottle of whiskey?

24:45.120 --> 24:47.327
Never mind,
I'll figure out dinner.

Hey!

25:38.830 --> 25:41.071
-Sorry.
-What's the matter with you?

25:41.080 --> 25:42.035
Aaah!

25:42.040 --> 25:42.995
-Hey, hey.
-Ryn!

25:43.000 --> 25:44.490
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ryn. Ryn.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.569

What the hell
is wrong with her?

25:46.540 --> 25:48.326
It's okay. You okay?

25:48.330 --> 25:50.321
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

25:50.330 --> 25:51.456

Ben and Maddie.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.742
Uh, she was upset.

26:16.750 --> 26:17.956
And a total--

26:17.960 --> 26:21.032
But she didn't
want to hurt us.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.373
[Maddie] It's my fault.
You're still recovering.

26:24.380 --> 26:25.529
We should've come home,

26:25.540 --> 26:27.326
not taken you
to a crowded market.

26:27.330 --> 26:29.457
Hey, it's
no one's fault, okay?

26:31.120 --> 26:33.168
We're home now.

26:33.170 --> 26:35.707
Let's all
just take it easy.

26:37.790 --> 26:38.916
Yes.

Easy.

to welcome you here.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.490
I'm John Rooney.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.320
Oh. Pleasure
to meet you, John.

26:59.330 --> 27:01.286
Is this your house?

27:01.290 --> 27:03.918
No. I have a small ranch
up in Larchwood.

27:03.920 --> 27:06.115
Beautiful place,
but I haven't been in months.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.667
Why not?

27:07.670 --> 27:11.458
The family's got me
tucked away in assisted living.

27:11.460 --> 27:13.496
-Oh.
-Figured it was time.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.786

Trust me, there is none.

27:18.920 --> 27:22.071
This must be a lot
to take in.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.822
Yeah, a complete
paradigm shift. [laughs]

27:24.830 --> 27:26.457
I'm getting used to them.

27:26.460 --> 27:29.076
You sound just like her.

27:30.290 --> 27:31.700
Sorry?

27:31.710 --> 27:34.531
Daphne. Your voices
are exactly the same.

27:36.290 --> 27:38.110
Did you know my mother?

27:38.120 --> 27:41.248
Cheelq attitude,
beautiful smile.

27:41.250 --> 27:43.070
Oh, no one
could miss Daphne.

27:44.540 --> 27:47.031
Can I, um, ask you

27:48.670 --> 27:52.162
when did my mother
part ways with the group?

27:52.170 --> 27:55.162
You know, dates get
a bit fuzzy at my age,

27:55.170 --> 27:59.118
but I reckon she was
around 30 or so.

27:59.120 --> 28:02.669
Oh. That's
before I was born.

28:05.500 --> 28:08.116
What happened
to your folks wasn't right.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.532
I'll never forget it.

28:10.540 --> 28:12.110
Sorry. What are you
talking about?

28:12.120 --> 28:15.783
Helen, how lovely
that you've met John.

28:15.790 --> 28:18.668
John, Sally and David
were just looking for you.

28:18.670 --> 28:20.206
Oh.

28:20.210 --> 28:21.950
I hope John
wasn't bothering you.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.780
Oh, no, not at all.

28:23.790 --> 28:25.951
We were just
swapping stories.

28:27.210 --> 28:29.872
John gets
a little confused sometimes.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.245
He's doing his best, though.

28:34.210 --> 28:37.247
John? Why don't
you come with me
and grab some dessert?

28:37.250 --> 28:38.410
Ooh.

28:47.790 --> 28:49.530
[dishes clattering]

28:56.670 --> 28:57.705
Ben okay?

28:59.920 --> 29:02.206
Yeah. I'm--
I'm just worried.

29:02.210 --> 29:04.246
The doctor hasn't texted?

29:05.250 --> 29:06.660
No. Radio silence.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.745
I'm sure he will
if he needs to.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.661
What if I did
the wrong thing?

29:15.170 --> 29:16.569
I think you're brave.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.377
I don't need
to be brave right now.

29:20.290 --> 29:21.951
I need to be right.

29:23.290 --> 29:24.746
Ben will be okay.

29:26.330 --> 29:29.208
Ryn and Maddie
will take care.

leave her here all alone.

39:00.670 --> 39:01.876
until he could come back
to work.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.324
He protected his crew.

39:03.330 --> 39:04.456
He'd have done
anything for them.

39:04.460 --> 39:05.996
North Star's gone, man.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.410
-That's not the point!
-Then what is?

39:07.420 --> 39:08.785
You're my crew!

39:08.790 --> 39:11.076
You! Boat or not!

39:11.080 --> 39:12.661
_ And I'm not
just gonna stand here

39:12.670 --> 39:13.989
and just let you get
involved in something so--

39:14.000 --> 39:16.161
something so dumb!

39:16.170 --> 39:18.286
Was I your crew
when you let

39:18.290 --> 39:20.497
both of our futures
go down in flames?

39:22.420 --> 39:23.489
Hmm?

39:24.580 --> 39:27.117
Yeah. Didn't think so.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.286
[surf rushing]

39:34.670 --> 39:36.285
[birds chirping]

39:36.290 --> 39:38.827
[boat motor buzzing]

39:38.830 --> 39:40.912
[Ryn rapidly panting]

39:53.500 --> 39:56.663
[cell phone ringing]

40:05.830 --> 40:06.876
Hello?

40:07.880 --> 40:09.871
[Elaine] Ben?

40:09.880 --> 40:11.666
-Mom?
-Ben.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.535
Are you okay?

40:13.540 --> 40:14.666
The pain.

40:16.830 --> 40:18.377
It's starting to go.

40:18.380 --> 40:20.280
It's not gone, but

40:20.290 --> 40:21.746
it's better.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.536
It is?

40:23.540 --> 40:26.919
And my hands.
They're starting
to regain some feeling.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.535
A little motion even.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.530
[grunting]

40:31.540 --> 40:34.031
I-- I can't
quite lift my arm, but...

40:36.710 --> 40:38.610
it's better.

40:38.620 --> 40:40.497
Mom, that's amazing.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.162
[panﬁng]

40:43.170 --> 40:46.571
Guess we'll need more
of those magic cells
you got me.

40:46.580 --> 40:48.241
[panﬁng]

40:48.250 --> 40:51.322
-Ben? Are you there?
-Ryn?

40:51.330 --> 40:52.706
Mom, I love you!
I gotta go!

40:52.710 --> 40:53.916
Well, I--

40:53.920 --> 40:55.205
Raah!

40:55.210 --> 40:57.166
[Ben] Ryn? Ryn!

40:57.170 --> 40:58.785
-Ryn!
-Aaah!

40:59.790 --> 41:01.746
Raah!

41:01.750 --> 41:03.706
[panﬁng]

41:05.250 --> 41:07.878
[dramatic music playing]

41:26.080 --> 41:27.206
[Ben] Ryn!

41:27.210 --> 41:28.245
[Maddie] Ryn!

41:31.420 --> 41:34.412
[high-pitched call]

41:37.210 --> 41:40.498
[music playing]
