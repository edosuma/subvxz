00:02.302 --> 00:04.937
You are being watched.

00:04.939 --> 00:06.856
The government
has a secret system,

00:06.858 --> 00:11.811
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.813 --> 00:14.046
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:14.048 --> 00:15.681
but it sees everything,

00:15.683 --> 00:19.152
violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:19.154 --> 00:22.054
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.106
We don't.

00:24.108 --> 00:28.761
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.396
You will never find us.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.832
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.834 --> 00:35.734
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

01:20.864 --> 01:23.349
I think we're up
against a world of corrupt cops.

01:23.351 --> 01:24.717
They steal the drugs, the cash,

01:24.719 --> 01:25.951
and they kill all the witnesses.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.786
Stills is narcotics.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.256
Yeah, I know damn well what
happened to Detective Stills,

01:30.258 --> 01:31.807
and so does Detective Fusco.

01:31.809 --> 01:34.117
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

01:35.980 --> 01:39.398
Our new number is receiving
an award today, Finch.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.400
Three decades of teaching

01:41.402 --> 01:43.302
and critical research,

01:43.304 --> 01:45.304
chief of cardiac surgery,

01:45.306 --> 01:48.574
a leader in the field
of heart transplants,

01:48.576 --> 01:52.645
a pioneer in off-pump bypass
cardiovascular surgery.

01:52.647 --> 01:55.981
He has held
the hearts and lives

01:55.983 --> 01:58.651
of hundreds of patients
in his hands.

01:58.653 --> 02:02.154
And today we are proud to bestow
upon Dr. Richard Nelson

02:02.156 --> 02:05.658
the title
of Professor Emeritus.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.127
Sounds like our latest number

02:09.130 --> 02:10.930
has a brain almost
as big as yours, Finch.

02:10.931 --> 02:14.216
If only mine were attached
to a surgeon's hands.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.852
Doctor, scientist, teacher,

02:16.854 --> 02:18.721
admired by his peers.

02:18.723 --> 02:21.857
Seems unlikely
he's a perpetrator.

02:21.859 --> 02:24.009
Which makes me wonder
if his killer

02:24.011 --> 02:27.029
could be in this crowd.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.714
_

02:36.157 --> 02:38.541
Thank you, Dr. di Matteo,
for those kind words.

02:38.543 --> 02:40.242
Uh, you left out
scratch golfer.

02:41.696 --> 02:44.797
Uh...

02:49.954 --> 02:52.638
I think it was Plato
that said knowledge

02:52.640 --> 02:55.874
is the food of the soul.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.877
In these trying times,

02:57.879 --> 03:00.513
we should heed the words
of Plato,

03:00.515 --> 03:03.882
"He who commits injustice

03:03.884 --> 03:05.768
is ever made more wretched

03:05.770 --> 03:10.022
than he who suffers it."

03:10.024 --> 03:13.142
This injustice
will never diminish

03:13.144 --> 03:17.563
the life and actions
of a good man.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.916
My godson, Calvin Beecher.

03:20.918 --> 03:23.119
Brave to the end.

03:23.121 --> 03:25.070
May he rest in peace.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.422
Present arms!

03:26.424 --> 03:27.456
Ready!

03:30.211 --> 03:32.011
Fire!

03:32.013 --> 03:34.246
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.048
Thank you for coming.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.917
Thank you.

03:40.520 --> 03:44.857
So, hey, what's next,
Dr. Nelson?

03:44.859 --> 03:46.392
Do I need a new cardiologist?

03:46.394 --> 03:48.194
Brandon, what are you
doing here?

03:48.196 --> 03:50.429
Come on, it's not often
your doctor gets emeritus.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.914
You deserved it.

03:51.916 --> 03:54.116
Thanks, but I'm not
going anywhere just yet.

03:54.118 --> 03:56.369
One of Nelson's patients
is here, Finch.

03:56.371 --> 03:59.822
Brandon Boyd,
a trader at VAC Capital,

03:59.824 --> 04:01.106
a prominent hedge fund.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.626
Asset management
for high-income clients.

04:03.628 --> 04:05.110
I guess I'm gonna have
to start giving more attention

04:05.112 --> 04:07.580
to my retirement portfolio, huh?

04:07.582 --> 04:09.048
Racquetball Thursday?

04:09.050 --> 04:11.617
You give me a rematch,
I'll pick your brain

04:11.619 --> 04:13.669
about some emerging markets
in the health care industry.

04:13.671 --> 04:15.054
Thursday at the club,
you're on.

04:15.056 --> 04:16.255
- All right.
- Thanks.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.173
- Not so fast, Doc.
- Hey.

04:18.176 --> 04:19.507
If you're gonna rot your gut,

04:19.510 --> 04:23.095
you might as well do it
in style, right?

04:23.097 --> 04:25.181
'62?

04:25.183 --> 04:28.684
Dr. Rossmore, where did you
locate such a magical elixir?

04:28.686 --> 04:32.271
Oh, I have a patient who owns
a very large distillery,

04:32.273 --> 04:35.658
and he has a new heart
that came from you.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.284
- Listen, Garrett...
- Mm.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.103
...about the Philia drug trial,

04:47.105 --> 04:49.355
I'm really sorry about
the board's recommendation--

04:49.357 --> 04:50.823
Nonsense.

04:50.825 --> 04:52.258
It had nothing to do
with the board or with you.

04:52.260 --> 04:53.992
We didn't have the data
to support it.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.328
Dr. Garrett Rossmore,
esteemed colleague

04:56.330 --> 04:57.963
and research scientist.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.182
He now works
for Philia Pharmaceuticals.

05:00.184 --> 05:02.601
Big pharma, he's a drug guy.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.354
Rossmore developed
a new statin to raise HDL

05:05.356 --> 05:07.306
and combat cholesterol.

05:07.308 --> 05:10.392
Made it all the way
to phase three in trials,

05:10.394 --> 05:12.561
until it underperformed.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.930
Dr. Nelson was a member
of the independent review board

05:14.932 --> 05:16.348
that halted the trials.

05:16.350 --> 05:19.368
Potential blockbuster drug
down the drain.

05:19.370 --> 05:22.204
Likely cost Philia billions
in lost revenues,

05:22.206 --> 05:25.374
not to mention six years
of Rossmore's research.

05:25.376 --> 05:28.461
That had to hurt.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.632
I know you had a hand in this.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.967
I know you were
behind Beecher's murder.

05:34.969 --> 05:36.635
You're not gonna
get away with this.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.138
Tell me, Fusco,
how is it everybody around you

05:39.140 --> 05:41.190
winds up getting killed?

05:41.192 --> 05:42.975
Starting to look suspicious.

05:42.977 --> 05:46.812
You're gonna pay for this.
I'm gonna take you down.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.097
You got a bad habit
of forgetting

05:48.099 --> 05:49.849
who your friends are.

05:49.851 --> 05:52.401
Of all your old pals who got
locked up or went missing,

05:52.403 --> 05:54.219
and you're the only one
who got to walk away?

05:54.221 --> 05:58.073
Did you honestly think that
was because you were so smart?

05:58.075 --> 05:59.191
What are you talking about?

05:59.193 --> 06:01.076
Protection.

06:01.078 --> 06:03.729
The kind
you don't have anymore.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.781
See, I hear things.

06:05.783 --> 06:09.168
IAB, they're looking
at your old pal Azarello

06:09.170 --> 06:12.070
on at least a dozen
old murder counts.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.073
That should be interesting.

06:15.075 --> 06:18.744
Past has a way of coming back
to haunt you.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.714
And by the time
I'm done with you, Lionel,

06:21.716 --> 06:25.751
you're gonna wish you were
in the ground with Beecher.

06:30.690 --> 06:34.560
- Ah.
- Congratulations, Doctor.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.261
It's nice to see someone
being recognized

06:36.263 --> 06:37.947
for their body of work.

06:37.949 --> 06:39.698
I should be so lucky one day.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.903
Associate Professor
Dr. Juliana di Matteo.

06:43.905 --> 06:47.623
Came up as Nelson's
research assistant and protege.

06:47.625 --> 06:50.576
But still hasn't made tenure.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.995
- Have you seen my daughter?
- I think she saw me first.

06:52.997 --> 06:54.463
Probably why she left so early.

06:54.465 --> 06:57.883
Oh, uh--

06:57.885 --> 06:59.618
Richard, are you okay?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.887
Your nose is bleeding.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.722
Oh, gosh, I'm gonna
go get something.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.308
Thank you.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.626
Mm.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.963
- Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.

07:13.316 --> 07:15.634
Nelson has
a daughter here, Finch.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.404
Molly Nelson,
registered as a junior

07:18.406 --> 07:21.273
but suspended for a semester
after assaulting

07:21.275 --> 07:24.660
a police officer
during a campus demonstration.

07:26.830 --> 07:29.448
- You need some help, sir?
- I feel a little light-headed.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.918
- I just need to sit down.
- Sure.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.754
I'll get you some water.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.155
Thanks again.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.991
Our doctor doesn't
look well, Finch.

07:38.993 --> 07:42.845
Clammy hands, nosebleeds.
Just hope we're not too late.

07:48.852 --> 07:50.335
Excuse me, Detective Fusco?

07:50.337 --> 07:53.105
Detective Soriano
from Internal Affairs.

07:53.107 --> 07:54.473
We need to talk.

07:54.475 --> 07:57.175
- No, we don't.
- I'm afraid we do.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.862
It's regarding the disappearance
of Detective Stills.

07:59.864 --> 08:01.146
And we're gonna have to ask

08:01.148 --> 08:04.700
for your badge
and your service weapon.

08:40.681 --> 08:43.066
What's this about, Fusco?

08:43.068 --> 08:44.818
This don't concern you, Carter.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.102
No?

08:46.104 --> 08:49.322
I'm your partner.
I think it does.

08:49.324 --> 08:51.157
This got something to do
with Cal's murder?

08:51.159 --> 08:53.476
No.

08:53.478 --> 08:56.079
Talk to me, Lionel.

08:56.081 --> 09:00.450
Why is IAB all of a sudden
putting the screws to you?

09:00.452 --> 09:02.335
You know, I tried
to come to you.

09:02.337 --> 09:03.837
In this very room.

09:03.839 --> 09:05.655
To tell you
about past mistakes I've made.

09:05.657 --> 09:06.656
But you didn't want to hear it.

09:06.658 --> 09:11.494
I'm listening now.

09:11.496 --> 09:16.166
Just chickens
coming home to roost.

09:16.168 --> 09:18.101
Bad things happen
to people around me, Carter,

09:18.103 --> 09:19.386
so you should get out of here.

09:24.526 --> 09:28.344
We're not done here.

09:30.181 --> 09:31.514
Finch, what do you need?

09:31.516 --> 09:34.517
I'm sorry for your loss,
Detective.

09:34.519 --> 09:37.037
Yeah. Thanks.

09:37.039 --> 09:38.655
Just don't understand,

09:38.657 --> 09:40.690
with all the information
you get,

09:40.692 --> 09:42.909
how we couldn't
stop this in time.

09:42.911 --> 09:44.794
It's a question
that troubles me as well.

09:44.796 --> 09:46.997
I only wish I had
an adequate answer.

09:46.999 --> 09:49.499
And I know this is not
the best time, but--

09:49.501 --> 09:51.868
You and John need some help.

09:51.870 --> 09:53.470
Are you kidding me?

09:53.472 --> 09:55.472
Cal is dead, and Fusco's

09:55.474 --> 09:57.307
being investigated by IAB.

09:57.309 --> 09:58.708
I understand that you're upset,

09:58.710 --> 10:00.209
but we have a doctor in peril.

10:00.211 --> 10:02.228
I just need you
to check on a few names.

10:02.230 --> 10:04.898
No. No.

10:04.900 --> 10:08.101
This time, you're gonna
do something for me.

10:08.103 --> 10:10.687
Okay, Detective,
what can I do for you?

10:10.689 --> 10:13.940
You know
that phone cloning thing you do?

10:13.942 --> 10:16.493
My turn.

10:22.951 --> 10:24.751
Hello?

10:24.753 --> 10:27.037
Thanks for showing up.

10:27.039 --> 10:28.505
I guess
it was better than that stunt

10:28.507 --> 10:30.406
you pulled last week,
throwing the red paint.

10:30.408 --> 10:32.408
Sorry, dad, but people
have the right to know

10:32.410 --> 10:35.428
the medical school
uses animals for research.

10:35.430 --> 10:37.881
Sounds like Nelson has
some issues with his daughter.

10:37.883 --> 10:39.599
And you have the right to know
that this university

10:39.601 --> 10:42.251
paid for your food, clothing,
and the roof over your head

10:42.253 --> 10:45.021
for the past 22 years,
not to mention your tuition.

10:45.023 --> 10:46.589
Sorry if I disappointed you,
dad.

10:46.591 --> 10:49.526
Oh, damn it, Molly,
that's not the point.

10:49.528 --> 10:52.428
Uh, I have to go.

10:52.430 --> 10:56.032
We'll talk about this later.

11:03.909 --> 11:05.775
The Doctor just vomited blood.

11:18.222 --> 11:20.807
Nelson in serious trouble.
I'm going in.

11:20.809 --> 11:22.125
911, what is your emergency?

11:22.127 --> 11:24.293
Hi, this is
Dr. Richard Nelson.

11:24.295 --> 11:27.480
I think I may have
ingested something toxic.

11:27.482 --> 11:29.132
- Sir, you're a doctor?
- Yes.

11:29.134 --> 11:31.317
I think someone
may have tried to kill me.

11:39.978 --> 11:41.244
You look like
you need some help.

11:41.246 --> 11:43.830
Aah!
You!

11:43.832 --> 11:45.582
I know you from the reception.

11:45.584 --> 11:46.533
- Get away from me!
- Wait, Doc--

11:46.535 --> 11:47.701
- Who are you?
- No--

11:47.703 --> 11:51.671
- NYPD! Who called 911?
- Me.

11:51.673 --> 11:54.591
I called it in.
I want to report a murder.

11:54.593 --> 11:56.092
Murder? What are you
talking about, buddy?

11:56.094 --> 11:57.377
- Who was murdered?
- Me!

11:57.379 --> 11:59.212
Someone poisoned me!

11:59.214 --> 12:02.015
Finch, things just went
completely sideways.

12:02.017 --> 12:06.502
And judging by his symptoms,
we're already too late.

12:08.189 --> 12:12.692
We've received some new
information on an old case.

12:15.062 --> 12:19.399
You and Jimmy Stills
worked together in the 51st?

12:19.401 --> 12:22.535
Yeah.
So did a lot of other cops.

12:22.537 --> 12:24.070
But you two were close?

12:24.072 --> 12:25.655
I don't know
if I'd put it that way.

12:25.657 --> 12:27.690
Oh, and how would you put it?

12:27.692 --> 12:30.210
We walked a beat together
coming up.

12:30.212 --> 12:31.861
He went to Narcotics.
I went to Homicide.

12:31.863 --> 12:34.030
That's the long
and short of it.

12:38.836 --> 12:42.555
Last call!

12:44.975 --> 12:47.227
Hey, O'Neill--
O'Reilly, O'whatever the hell

12:47.229 --> 12:51.097
your name is, give us a drink.

12:51.099 --> 12:53.850
Nah.

12:53.852 --> 12:55.384
You're done.

12:55.386 --> 12:57.687
Come on, it's time
to hit the bricks, buddy.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.240
What are you talking about?
We still got five minutes left.

13:00.242 --> 13:01.858
Easy there, big dog.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.193
That's enough for one night.

13:03.195 --> 13:05.912
Let's get you home.

13:05.914 --> 13:09.565
I can't go home.

13:09.567 --> 13:11.451
She threw me out.

13:11.453 --> 13:12.836
Ah, comes with the job.

13:12.838 --> 13:15.455
Cop's wife.
She'll come around.

13:15.457 --> 13:18.825
Not this time.

13:18.827 --> 13:20.960
She had a lawyer
drop papers on me.

13:20.962 --> 13:23.763
Serious?

13:23.765 --> 13:26.216
Sorry to hear about that.

13:26.218 --> 13:31.137
Yeah, Jimmy, she--

13:31.139 --> 13:35.591
she wants full custody
of my son.

13:35.593 --> 13:38.611
Hmm.

13:38.613 --> 13:40.063
Come on, Lionel.

13:40.065 --> 13:41.931
You come home.
You stay at my place tonight.

13:41.933 --> 13:43.750
The kids will love
waking up tomorrow morning,

13:43.752 --> 13:45.368
jumping on your head.

13:45.370 --> 13:47.070
I'll have Vera
cook up some hotcakes,

13:47.072 --> 13:49.038
banana-chocolate chip.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.124
Throw some Aspirin
in the batter.

13:51.126 --> 13:54.994
Okay, amigo?

13:54.996 --> 13:56.946
You sure it's okay?

13:56.948 --> 13:59.615
What are friends for?

14:03.470 --> 14:05.454
Let's go.

14:15.065 --> 14:17.150
I'm retracing
the Doctor's steps,

14:17.152 --> 14:18.601
and I'm already detecting

14:18.603 --> 14:20.136
low-level Alpha particle
emissions, Mr. Reese.

14:20.138 --> 14:21.688
Not good.

14:21.690 --> 14:24.473
Alpha particle radiation.

14:24.475 --> 14:26.159
It's polonium.

14:26.161 --> 14:27.994
Polonium?

14:27.996 --> 14:29.779
Sometimes used
to make complex tools

14:29.781 --> 14:31.080
in scientific equipment.

14:31.082 --> 14:32.699
Do you think he was exposed
in the lab?

14:32.701 --> 14:35.084
No, it's only lethal
if ingested

14:35.086 --> 14:37.754
and you don't get treated
within the first hour.

14:37.756 --> 14:39.822
Well, the area's contaminated,

14:39.824 --> 14:42.542
but it doesn't appear to be
the point of origin.

14:42.544 --> 14:44.177
What's Nelson's condition?

14:44.179 --> 14:46.996
I'm about to find out.

14:48.682 --> 14:51.267
You.
No, you're that waiter.

14:51.269 --> 14:53.386
You had something
to do with this.

14:53.388 --> 14:56.105
I'm not a waiter.
I'm here to help you.

14:56.107 --> 14:57.390
But you were at the reception.

14:57.392 --> 14:58.942
You slipped something
into my drink.

14:58.944 --> 15:01.110
No, I didn't,
but someone else did.

15:01.112 --> 15:04.197
I was supposed to save you,

15:04.199 --> 15:07.516
but I was too late.

15:09.036 --> 15:11.204
You've ingested polonium,
Doctor.

15:11.206 --> 15:12.572
You're dying.

15:12.574 --> 15:15.358
This is insane.
How do-- who are you?

15:15.360 --> 15:17.427
Nosebleeds, jaundice,
hair falling out.

15:17.429 --> 15:18.962
It's radiation poisoning.

15:18.964 --> 15:20.914
I'm aware how radiation
affects the body,

15:20.916 --> 15:22.248
but how do you know all this?

15:22.250 --> 15:24.050
You were poisoned
a few hours ago,

15:24.052 --> 15:26.336
which means,
in less than 24 hours,

15:26.338 --> 15:28.721
you will be dead.

15:28.723 --> 15:32.208
I'm sorry, Doctor.

15:32.210 --> 15:35.561
I-I don't understand.

15:35.563 --> 15:38.932
How--

15:38.934 --> 15:40.350
Who would want me dead?

15:40.352 --> 15:42.986
You would know better than I.

15:42.988 --> 15:46.189
Look, you can stay there
and die in that bed,

15:46.191 --> 15:49.108
or you can get up
and help me find the bastard

15:49.110 --> 15:52.061
who murdered you.

15:53.897 --> 15:57.166
Clock's ticking, Doc.

16:07.473 --> 16:09.608
Who was it?
I need to know.

16:09.610 --> 16:12.193
First we need
to get your affairs in order.

16:12.195 --> 16:15.363
You're right.
I need to see my daughter.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.616
Thank you for your interest.
Thanks, guys.

16:17.618 --> 16:18.633
Hope you can make it
to our benefit.

16:18.635 --> 16:19.701
Molly?
Molly?

16:19.703 --> 16:20.986
Can I have a word with you?

16:20.988 --> 16:24.205
Hey. She doesn't want
to talk to you.

16:24.207 --> 16:26.741
I can handle it, okay?

16:26.743 --> 16:29.744
Wow, came all the way down here
just to chew me out, huh?

16:29.746 --> 16:31.630
Thought you were jetting off
to some seminar or something.

16:31.632 --> 16:33.948
No, Molly, I didn't
come here to argue.

16:33.950 --> 16:35.834
I just came to see
if you were okay.

16:35.836 --> 16:37.752
Really?

16:37.754 --> 16:39.621
Yeah, your mom said you're
making some kind of documentary.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.473
Do you need any help?
Do you need money or anything?

16:41.475 --> 16:45.093
Um, are you feeling okay?

16:45.095 --> 16:46.227
You look a little pale.

16:46.229 --> 16:48.129
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

16:48.131 --> 16:53.685
I-I just stopped by
to say, um,

16:53.687 --> 16:56.821
uh...

16:56.823 --> 16:59.608
I'm sorry for...

16:59.610 --> 17:02.477
not being more involved.

17:02.479 --> 17:07.365
What, like, in my life, or--

17:07.367 --> 17:10.001
Well, maybe this was
a mistake, I don't know.

17:10.002 --> 17:12.819
- I just wish--
- Why are you here, dad?

17:12.821 --> 17:16.824
Look, I know that
I haven't been more available

17:16.826 --> 17:18.826
and putting my work first.

17:18.828 --> 17:20.161
That's probably
why your mother left.

17:20.163 --> 17:22.130
Mom left
because you cheated on her.

17:22.132 --> 17:24.332
Another mistake.

17:24.334 --> 17:28.687
But the one that I didn't make
was having a daughter.

17:31.140 --> 17:33.358
Earlier today when people
were congratulating me

17:33.360 --> 17:35.009
about my accomplishments,

17:35.011 --> 17:37.696
I-I was thinking
that the thing

17:37.698 --> 17:41.700
that I'm most proud of is you.

17:43.852 --> 17:48.540
That's all I came to say.

17:48.542 --> 17:52.827
Um...

17:52.829 --> 17:54.496
I'll call you tomorrow, dad.

17:54.498 --> 17:57.865
Yeah, sure.
Good.

17:57.867 --> 18:01.503
I would like that.

18:10.346 --> 18:13.014
At first,
I couldn't figure it out.

18:13.016 --> 18:15.734
Stills and Azarello
working Narcotics,

18:15.736 --> 18:18.870
bumping dealers,
stealing their stash. _

18:18.872 --> 18:20.488
Figured eventually they'd slip.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.440
Then it hit me.

18:22.442 --> 18:26.277
They had a man on the inside,
in case they made a mistake.

18:26.279 --> 18:27.562
I don't follow.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.330
They needed somebody
in Homicide.

18:29.332 --> 18:32.751
Your old pal Azarello
from the 51st,

18:32.753 --> 18:37.038
he clued us in.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.041
So tell me,
how did your crew operate?

18:40.043 --> 18:41.543
Like clockwork.

18:41.545 --> 18:43.578
First Stills, he got
the drop on a honey pot.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.530
I'd scope it out,

18:45.532 --> 18:46.798
make sure it was still hot.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.516
You know, then we'd roll up,

18:48.518 --> 18:50.552
flash the silver,
and help ourselves

18:50.554 --> 18:52.053
to the money and the dope.

18:52.055 --> 18:53.755
But if things went south,

18:53.757 --> 18:57.809
that's when Fusco came in.

18:57.811 --> 18:59.694
Azarello's
a lying piece of crap.

18:59.696 --> 19:02.397
The devil's always
in the details, Fusco.

19:02.399 --> 19:05.033
- Tell me about the first time.
- I'll never forget.

19:05.035 --> 19:09.204
It was some rat-infested
tenement over in Queens.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.159
Why you gotta
bring me down here?

19:14.161 --> 19:15.293
You just gotta call it in.

19:15.295 --> 19:16.411
Come on, Lionel, you know

19:16.413 --> 19:17.962
how these things
can go sideways.

19:17.964 --> 19:20.799
Just need a little help
from Homicide here.

19:20.801 --> 19:22.584
Aw, jeez.

19:22.586 --> 19:25.336
As soon as I started lifting,
this dumb bastard tried to run.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.955
I mean, I had no choice.
They're gonna have my nuts here.

19:27.957 --> 19:30.124
Calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine.

19:30.126 --> 19:32.126
Found that piece
in the nightstand.

19:32.128 --> 19:33.728
We gotta figure out
all the angles

19:33.730 --> 19:36.064
before IAB shows up.

19:36.066 --> 19:38.650
Whoa, you're asking me
to cover this?

19:38.652 --> 19:40.268
I'm gonna be screwed.

19:40.270 --> 19:42.487
Hey, whoa, come here.
What's the problem?

19:42.489 --> 19:43.971
I thought we had
each other's back.

19:43.973 --> 19:45.523
Yeah, but what
you're asking me here is--

19:45.525 --> 19:47.075
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:47.077 --> 19:48.142
When you needed somebody,
who was there for you?

19:48.144 --> 19:50.011
Who had your back?

19:50.013 --> 19:52.080
Look at this scumbag.

19:52.082 --> 19:54.833
Probably slings
to kids K through eight.

19:54.835 --> 19:58.920
- What do you say?
- I don't know.

19:58.922 --> 20:01.756
For a friend.

20:10.850 --> 20:14.102
Stand over there,
put two in the wall, chest high.

20:14.104 --> 20:17.272
Then, coming or going,
either way, it's self-defense.

20:17.274 --> 20:18.890
And wipe it down.

20:18.892 --> 20:21.559
That's it.

20:21.561 --> 20:23.278
Thanks, Lionel.

20:29.785 --> 20:32.353
Well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

20:32.355 --> 20:35.373
My favorite arresting officer.

20:35.375 --> 20:36.324
Looking good, Detective.

20:36.326 --> 20:38.209
Skip it, Azarello.

20:38.211 --> 20:40.528
Look, you've been in jail
for over a year.

20:40.530 --> 20:45.216
Why all of a sudden you talking
to IAB about Fusco?

20:45.218 --> 20:47.702
Maybe we got a code, Detective.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.504
Maybe Fusco violated it.

20:49.506 --> 20:51.723
Maybe the question should be
why you're just now bringing up

20:51.725 --> 20:53.558
your partner's past?

20:53.560 --> 20:55.042
It's pretty colorful.

20:55.044 --> 20:56.377
I thought Fusco had

20:56.379 --> 21:00.415
some dirty pictures of you
or something.

21:03.602 --> 21:07.488
Two dead cops.
Two missing.

21:07.490 --> 21:10.892
Is this HR's idea
of a comeback?

21:10.894 --> 21:13.745
Secrets are hard to bury.

21:13.747 --> 21:16.664
And sometimes...

21:16.666 --> 21:21.085
bodies have a way
of showing up.

21:21.087 --> 21:22.837
Tell you what.

21:22.839 --> 21:25.707
You help me out,
I'll talk to the DA.

21:25.709 --> 21:28.743
Maybe he shaves some time off
for good behavior, huh?

21:28.745 --> 21:31.763
You got a nice smile,
you know that?

21:31.765 --> 21:34.265
But you're a little late
to the deal-making party,

21:34.267 --> 21:35.917
Detective.

21:35.919 --> 21:40.087
If you'll excuse me,
I got a date with a sock.

21:47.029 --> 21:49.096
How did it go
at Rikers, Detective?

21:49.098 --> 21:52.617
Not so good, but I did find
something on one of your names.

21:52.619 --> 21:55.703
The asset manager, Brandon Boyd.
He's a trader at a hedge fund.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.555
VAC Capital, I'm aware.

21:57.557 --> 21:59.824
Are you aware they're
under SEC investigation?

21:59.826 --> 22:01.409
Insider trading.

22:01.411 --> 22:03.995
After they dumped
some big pharmaceutical stock.

22:03.997 --> 22:06.164
Let me guess.
Philia pharmaceuticals.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.333
My contact at the SEC thinks

22:08.335 --> 22:10.468
they got a tip
on some drug trial.

22:10.470 --> 22:11.636
Does that help?

22:11.638 --> 22:14.339
Unfortunately, yes, it does.

22:16.643 --> 22:21.295
- Ever heard of VAC Capital?
- Yeah, sure.

22:21.297 --> 22:22.730
They manage my money.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.432
Well, they're
under SEC investigation

22:24.434 --> 22:25.767
for insider trading.

22:25.769 --> 22:27.735
Insider trading?
On what?

22:27.737 --> 22:29.654
Did you tell Brandon Boyd
that a drug trial

22:29.656 --> 22:31.105
was about to fail?

22:31.107 --> 22:34.158
What? I don't know.
Maybe at the club.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.743
Well, he turned around
and used that information

22:35.745 --> 22:38.112
to bet against Philia stock,

22:38.114 --> 22:41.816
made $500 million.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.918
Son of a bitch.
$1/2 billion?

22:43.920 --> 22:45.670
Off your tip.

22:45.672 --> 22:48.623
You're the leak, Doc.

22:48.625 --> 22:52.093
There's an investigation?

22:52.095 --> 22:55.346
They don't know
the insider yet.

22:55.348 --> 22:58.816
I'm guessing VAC Capital
plans to keep it that way.

22:58.818 --> 23:01.019
Instead they killed me?

23:01.021 --> 23:04.839
You're the liability.
You had to go.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.058
I'm a doctor.

23:07.060 --> 23:09.644
People ask me things
all the time, advice.

23:09.646 --> 23:13.982
You know, that drug
and this diet and--

23:13.984 --> 23:15.900
Oh...

23:15.902 --> 23:17.902
it's just an excuse.

23:17.904 --> 23:21.122
What I did was wrong,

23:21.124 --> 23:22.857
and now I'm a dead man.

23:22.859 --> 23:27.528
All because I couldn't
keep my mouth shut.

23:27.530 --> 23:29.831
You made a mistake.

23:29.833 --> 23:34.886
That doesn't mean
you deserve to die.

23:34.888 --> 23:38.039
You're right.

23:38.041 --> 23:41.759
I need to talk to Boyd.

23:47.734 --> 23:49.150
Mr. Reese,

23:49.152 --> 23:50.268
I believe
I've located the origin

23:50.270 --> 23:54.489
of the poisoning.

23:54.491 --> 23:57.658
It came from water placed
on the podium at his ceremony.

23:57.660 --> 24:00.244
There were only two people
on that service staff.

24:00.246 --> 24:01.696
Me and a waitress.

24:01.698 --> 24:04.899
And I think I know
who hired her.

24:04.901 --> 24:08.169
Time to go track down a trader.

24:13.008 --> 24:15.460
- Ticket, sir.
- Right away.

24:15.462 --> 24:17.578
All right, so call me
about the hold on those shares.

24:17.580 --> 24:20.247
Hey, and the number of
that hot Brazilian model, huh?

24:20.249 --> 24:24.385
Later, boss.

24:24.387 --> 24:26.521
- Your car, sir.
- You want a tip?

24:26.523 --> 24:29.857
Never get hitched
without a prenup.

24:32.227 --> 24:34.112
Here's a better one.

24:34.114 --> 24:37.932
Don't get in the car
with strangers.

24:52.342 --> 24:56.762
Hey, hey!

24:56.764 --> 25:00.183
Dr. Nelson.
What's going on here?

25:00.185 --> 25:01.634
I don't have a lot of time.

25:01.636 --> 25:06.189
And neither do you,
if you answer me wrong.

25:06.191 --> 25:09.308
You met me at the club,
you took me on as a client,

25:09.310 --> 25:10.976
and you pretended
to be my friend.

25:10.978 --> 25:12.662
And I told you
about a drug trial,

25:12.664 --> 25:14.813
and you turned around,
and you burned me!

25:14.815 --> 25:16.449
Wait a sec.
I am a trader.

25:16.451 --> 25:18.034
That's all I do.
I trade.

25:18.036 --> 25:19.752
Yeah, and you triggered
an SEC investigation.

25:19.754 --> 25:21.754
And before they found me,
you poisoned me.

25:21.756 --> 25:22.705
What?

25:22.707 --> 25:24.090
Whoa, guys.

25:24.092 --> 25:25.658
I don't know anything
about that.

25:25.660 --> 25:26.842
- No, huh?
- Look, you should really

25:26.844 --> 25:30.863
just pull over now--
aah! Whoa!

25:30.865 --> 25:33.466
Hold on.
You don't understand.

25:33.468 --> 25:36.168
The boss is on my ass, 24/7.

25:36.170 --> 25:38.271
Either you get black edge,
or you're out.

25:38.273 --> 25:39.672
Black edge?

25:39.674 --> 25:41.691
Inside information
that no one else has,

25:41.693 --> 25:43.226
that's beyond doubt.

25:43.228 --> 25:45.344
We were all-in
on that drug,

25:45.346 --> 25:47.196
but I needed to find someone
on the trial.

25:47.198 --> 25:49.848
Either you get that edge
and turn big profits,

25:49.850 --> 25:51.567
or Lord Vader
cuts your balls off.

25:51.569 --> 25:53.236
So that's why you recruited me?

25:53.238 --> 25:55.321
I needed that advantage,
and you wanted in

25:55.323 --> 25:57.490
to a big hedge fund.

25:57.492 --> 25:59.024
But I swear I had nothing
to do with--

25:59.026 --> 26:00.743
But you were
at the ceremony today.

26:00.745 --> 26:03.462
Yeah, boss man said
to go about my regular schedule.

26:03.464 --> 26:05.631
By "boss man,"
you mean Vincent Cochran?

26:05.633 --> 26:07.250
Look, I've said enough already.

26:07.252 --> 26:10.553
Yes! Vincent Cochran.

26:10.555 --> 26:13.172
- And you told him about me?
- I had to.

26:13.174 --> 26:16.759
We got investigated.
He asked if we'd been exposed.

26:16.761 --> 26:19.312
- Said he'd take care of it.
- Where's Cochran now?

26:19.314 --> 26:20.930
You don't seem to understand.

26:20.932 --> 26:23.048
This is not a man
you want to cross.

26:23.050 --> 26:25.935
Have I told you
that my eyesight is failing?

26:25.937 --> 26:28.220
Okay! The lodge!

26:28.222 --> 26:31.724
The Windcrest! Upstate!

26:35.996 --> 26:37.413
I need to talk to Carter.

26:37.415 --> 26:39.498
I need to have my kid
picked up for practice.

26:39.500 --> 26:42.001
As soon as you answer
a few questions.

26:42.003 --> 26:44.287
You know, Fusco,
it wasn't long ago

26:44.289 --> 26:46.339
that I was
a plain clothes detective.

26:46.341 --> 26:48.207
- No kidding.
- No kidding.

26:48.209 --> 26:49.709
But you know what the difference
is between me and you?

26:49.711 --> 26:53.646
- What's that?
- I never murdered people.

26:53.648 --> 26:56.849
See, I know you weren't
just covering for those guys.

26:56.851 --> 26:59.018
You were one of them.

26:59.020 --> 27:02.555
Once you get a taste of that,
there's no looking back.

27:07.060 --> 27:10.313
Fusco, get in here.

27:12.532 --> 27:15.601
- Oh, for crying out loud.
- Fusco, what's wrong?

27:15.603 --> 27:17.653
Can't stand the sight
of a little blood?

27:17.655 --> 27:19.538
Hey, knock it off.
He's good.

27:19.540 --> 27:22.742
Grab a bag.
We got a big haul here.

27:22.744 --> 27:25.461
No, thanks.
This is all you guys.

27:25.463 --> 27:27.112
I don't want any part of this.

27:27.114 --> 27:29.498
It's a little late for that,
ain't it?

27:29.500 --> 27:32.752
Look out!

27:35.622 --> 27:37.673
Oh.

27:37.675 --> 27:41.093
You see there?
I knew you were solid.

27:47.684 --> 27:50.820
Welcome to the crew, Lionel.

27:50.822 --> 27:53.005
All right,
let's get out of here.

27:53.007 --> 27:55.191
Come on.
Let's go.

27:59.963 --> 28:02.748
Azarello flipped on you.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.483
We thought Stills
was halfway to Belize,

28:04.485 --> 28:06.335
but now we know different.

28:06.337 --> 28:10.840
You got rid of him
because you had to.

28:10.842 --> 28:12.375
All you got is lies
from a dirty cop.

28:12.377 --> 28:13.926
It'll never hold up in court.

28:13.928 --> 28:17.346
Well, you know
what will hold up in court?

28:17.348 --> 28:19.498
Evidence.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.434
You see, when dirty cops want

28:21.436 --> 28:23.436
to eliminate DNA
from a crime scene,

28:23.438 --> 28:25.020
they use bleach.

28:25.022 --> 28:27.189
But bleach stains things.

28:27.191 --> 28:29.942
Like the carpet and the trunk
of the vehicle

28:29.944 --> 28:34.530
that you signed out on the day
that Stills disappeared.

28:34.532 --> 28:35.564
No idea
what you're talking about.

28:35.566 --> 28:36.949
Mm.

28:36.951 --> 28:40.286
Your cell phone records.

28:40.288 --> 28:41.570
You made a call

28:41.572 --> 28:44.573
from Oyster Bay
to your home the very night

28:44.575 --> 28:47.743
that Stills went missing.

28:47.745 --> 28:50.195
Any reason you were
in Oyster Bay

28:50.197 --> 28:52.798
at 2:00 AM
on a Thursday?

28:52.800 --> 28:54.917
Thinking about retiring
out there.

28:54.919 --> 28:56.502
Wanted to look at some land.

28:56.504 --> 28:59.338
You take soil samples?

28:59.340 --> 29:03.008
Domain awareness, my friend.

29:03.010 --> 29:04.727
Satellites,
they're changing the world.

29:04.729 --> 29:07.563
You pick a time and place,
we send you a photo

29:07.565 --> 29:11.884
of the ass hairs on a frog,
or in this case,

29:11.886 --> 29:13.269
disturbed plots of earth

29:13.271 --> 29:15.521
in Oyster Bay.

29:15.523 --> 29:19.108
Which of the four
is it, Detective?

29:19.110 --> 29:23.078
I got two dozen unis
gathering shovels,

29:23.080 --> 29:25.397
a backhoe, and cadaver dogs.

29:25.399 --> 29:28.617
Come sunup, we're gonna
go on a little treasure hunt.

29:28.619 --> 29:30.336
Make it easy on yourself.

29:30.338 --> 29:33.622
Just tell me
where you buried Stills.

29:37.511 --> 29:39.295
I know you killed him,

29:39.297 --> 29:41.580
just like those lowlifes.

29:41.582 --> 29:44.416
You're a dirty cop,
and come morning,

29:44.418 --> 29:47.903
I'm gonna dig up your sins.

30:08.208 --> 30:11.327
You wanted to talk?

30:14.498 --> 30:17.666
So...

30:17.668 --> 30:20.252
the questions
you asked me earlier--

30:20.254 --> 30:23.422
the ones I didn't answer.

30:27.310 --> 30:28.811
I didn't kill Stills,

30:28.813 --> 30:33.983
but I'm gonna go down for it
just the same.

30:33.985 --> 30:38.020
But I deserve it
because of--

30:38.022 --> 30:41.690
Because?

30:41.692 --> 30:43.409
Because of
the other bad things I did.

30:43.411 --> 30:45.027
You see,
back at the 51st--

30:45.029 --> 30:47.162
All right, wait,
what do you mean,

30:47.164 --> 30:51.600
"the other bad things"?

30:51.602 --> 30:56.372
See, at--
at first, I...

30:56.374 --> 31:01.510
I thought I was helping to
clean up the streets, you know?

31:01.512 --> 31:05.514
Who's gonna miss some drug money
from a lowlife dealer?

31:05.516 --> 31:09.552
Then it became
who's gonna miss the dealer?

31:09.554 --> 31:10.686
Me and...

31:10.688 --> 31:15.190
me and Stills, we were friends.

31:15.192 --> 31:17.309
He was there for me
like a brother, you know?

31:17.311 --> 31:18.894
He had my back.

31:18.896 --> 31:21.363
And then...

31:21.365 --> 31:24.066
then you find yourself
in a situation,

31:24.068 --> 31:29.021
a bad situation
that you shouldn't be in.

31:30.740 --> 31:33.993
I killed people, Carter.

31:33.995 --> 31:37.029
I was a dirty cop.

31:39.382 --> 31:43.719
But, um... since I met you
and our friends,

31:43.721 --> 31:45.888
that's all changed.

31:45.890 --> 31:47.840
I'm not that guy anymore.

31:47.842 --> 31:49.308
You always told me
that if--

31:49.310 --> 31:51.760
that if my past
came back around,

31:51.762 --> 31:53.896
you wouldn't cover for me,
and I'm not asking you to.

31:53.898 --> 31:55.648
I just need you
to understand--

31:55.650 --> 31:57.766
Stop. Mm-mm.

31:57.768 --> 32:00.552
I can't.

32:00.554 --> 32:03.772
I don't want to hear any more.

32:03.774 --> 32:07.159
I don't know
who you are, Lionel.

32:25.645 --> 32:30.099
Doc, stay with me.

32:30.101 --> 32:31.717
Just wanted to look the bastard

32:31.719 --> 32:33.135
who killed me in the face.

32:33.137 --> 32:36.055
- Don't give up yet.
- It's okay.

32:36.057 --> 32:38.607
It's time to face
the consequences.

32:38.609 --> 32:40.726
We all make mistakes.

32:40.728 --> 32:45.147
I--

32:45.149 --> 32:48.400
Man, hey, did he just die?

32:54.991 --> 32:56.942
Oh, man, is he dead?

32:56.944 --> 33:00.412
Shut up, or you're next.

33:04.551 --> 33:08.137
Oh, my God,
you're not gonna--

33:08.139 --> 33:09.872
Come on.

33:09.874 --> 33:12.508
Come on.
Come on.

33:23.436 --> 33:25.437
You can't die yet.

33:25.439 --> 33:30.693
We've got
one more mission to finish.

33:30.695 --> 33:32.978
Come on.

33:38.201 --> 33:40.669
This is crazy.

33:40.671 --> 33:42.705
Hey, you can't just
leave me standing out here.

33:42.707 --> 33:45.040
You're right.

34:12.460 --> 34:15.929
You recognize me,
Mr. Cochran?

34:15.931 --> 34:18.116
Should I?

34:18.118 --> 34:21.985
I'm the man you murdered.

34:36.835 --> 34:39.387
What are you doing about Fusco?

34:39.389 --> 34:42.239
At the moment, nothing.
I'm busy.

34:42.242 --> 34:44.775
After all we've been through,
I thought he was your friend.

34:44.777 --> 34:46.811
I always thought
he was your partner.

34:46.813 --> 34:48.929
Not after what he just told me.

34:48.931 --> 34:50.965
Do you know what he's done?

34:50.967 --> 34:52.650
He deserves to be behind bars.

34:52.652 --> 34:55.485
Listen, Carter,
no one's ever looked at me

34:55.487 --> 34:57.071
as the moral benchmark.

34:57.072 --> 35:00.658
I guess you'll have
to make that call yourself.

35:00.660 --> 35:04.645
I'm a cop, okay?
But it's Fusco.

35:04.647 --> 35:06.330
It's not as simple as that.

35:06.332 --> 35:09.867
I always thought it was
in your book.

35:09.869 --> 35:15.223
Once a dirty cop,
always a dirty cop, right?

35:15.225 --> 35:16.457
You'll have to excuse me.

35:16.459 --> 35:19.510
I have to get back to work.

35:30.839 --> 35:33.024
You know what polonium
does to the human body,

35:33.026 --> 35:34.508
Mr. Cochran?

35:34.510 --> 35:37.195
I have a feeling
you're about to tell me.

35:37.197 --> 35:39.197
Once it enters the bloodstream,

35:39.199 --> 35:41.699
it immediately starts to
break down the immune system.

35:41.701 --> 35:44.368
It seeps into the bone marrow,

35:44.370 --> 35:47.538
so your body can no longer
fend off its own bacteria,

35:47.540 --> 35:50.908
which starts to eat you
from the inside out.

35:50.910 --> 35:53.527
It attacks your DNA,

35:53.529 --> 35:55.246
shuts down
your internal organs.

35:55.248 --> 35:59.333
It's fairly rapid,
but I assure you,

35:59.335 --> 36:01.202
it's very painful.

36:01.204 --> 36:03.537
Amazing you're still here.

36:03.539 --> 36:07.425
Well, the last 24 hours
have been a living hell.

36:07.427 --> 36:11.646
It's a truly diabolical way
of killing someone.

36:11.648 --> 36:15.650
But then I'm just a doctor.

36:15.652 --> 36:18.886
I'm no match for a shrewd,

36:18.888 --> 36:21.355
international
hedge fund billionaire.

36:21.357 --> 36:23.441
Perhaps you
sell yourself short.

36:23.443 --> 36:25.392
Oh, no, I get it now.

36:25.394 --> 36:28.412
You and your firm,
you're not really interested

36:28.414 --> 36:31.065
in medicinal drugs
or curing disease.

36:31.067 --> 36:32.917
You're just a man
who makes money,

36:32.919 --> 36:36.037
even if you have to cheat, hmm?

36:36.039 --> 36:39.040
I'm an investor.
I trade stocks.

36:39.042 --> 36:42.877
But if I know I picked a loser,

36:42.879 --> 36:45.913
I have to dump it.

36:45.915 --> 36:49.416
Either way, I always win.

36:51.470 --> 36:56.524
I've done some good things,
some bad.

36:56.526 --> 37:01.595
I managed to ruin my life,
my reputation.

37:02.648 --> 37:06.234
But I don't deserve to die.

37:06.236 --> 37:09.120
And the SEC will
bring your firm down.

37:09.122 --> 37:14.008
Unfortunately, Doctor,
the SEC investigation

37:14.010 --> 37:15.493
will die with you.

37:15.495 --> 37:17.778
Oh-ho.

37:17.780 --> 37:23.751
I think you mean us.

37:23.753 --> 37:26.954
Uh, your nose is bleeding.

37:32.311 --> 37:34.929
You have $9 billion,

37:34.931 --> 37:38.182
but you only have
24 hours to spend it.

37:44.856 --> 37:48.359
I hope you invest it wisely.

37:56.318 --> 38:01.155
Nice place to dump a body.

38:01.157 --> 38:04.658
But a little snow won't keep
the dogs from finding it.

38:11.633 --> 38:14.835
Let's go.
End of the line.

38:23.278 --> 38:26.697
You know, at the end
of the day, as a cop,

38:26.699 --> 38:29.483
you're the sum
of two sides of the ledger.

38:29.485 --> 38:32.320
The people who want
to see you go down

38:32.322 --> 38:34.789
and the people who don't
give a crap about you.

38:34.791 --> 38:39.493
Now, Fusco, I don't think
anyone gives a crap about you.

38:39.495 --> 38:41.629
Hey, Detective, up this way.

38:41.631 --> 38:45.716
Come on.
Let's go.

38:57.646 --> 38:59.030
Oh, don't worry, honey.

38:59.032 --> 39:02.383
There'll be other guys.
Trust me.

39:02.385 --> 39:07.355
I love you too, sweetheart.

39:07.357 --> 39:10.274
Good-bye.

39:12.694 --> 39:17.365
'62 limited edition.
Your favorite.

39:17.367 --> 39:20.451
Cheeky bastard.

39:31.279 --> 39:32.596
And thank you.

39:32.598 --> 39:36.801
For what?

39:36.803 --> 39:40.421
For giving me another shot.

39:40.423 --> 39:43.691
At all this.

40:02.077 --> 40:05.112
We lost Dr. Nelson, Finch.

40:05.114 --> 40:09.216
He was a good man.

40:09.218 --> 40:13.087
We arrived too late
to save him.

40:13.089 --> 40:16.290
Seems to be
a common occurrence of late.

40:16.292 --> 40:22.146
First Szymanski,
then Beecher, now Dr. Nelson.

40:22.148 --> 40:26.150
Is something wrong
with the machine, Finch?

40:26.152 --> 40:29.854
I don't know.

40:29.856 --> 40:35.025
Then who else are we missing?

40:37.079 --> 40:39.997
Just a matter of time now,
Fusco.

40:39.999 --> 40:41.365
What do you say
you lay down in this hole?

40:41.367 --> 40:43.584
I'll grab a shovel.
Get up there.

40:43.586 --> 40:46.954
Detective Soriano.

40:46.956 --> 40:50.374
Time to face the truth, Fusco.

40:57.716 --> 40:59.850
Sir, the canine
alerted right here,

40:59.852 --> 41:03.187
and the soil was loose.

41:03.189 --> 41:07.057
There was a body here,
Detective, but--

41:07.059 --> 41:10.194
Somebody moved it.

41:14.699 --> 41:16.951
You think
this is some kind of joke?

41:16.953 --> 41:19.003
I know you killed Stills,
you son of a bitch.

41:19.005 --> 41:21.989
What'd you do with the body?

41:21.991 --> 41:24.408
Screw you.

41:28.046 --> 41:31.031
This ain't over, Fusco.

41:31.033 --> 41:34.251
I know you're a dirty cop.

41:34.253 --> 41:37.204
You're wrong about that.

41:37.206 --> 41:40.307
And I'll take my gun
and shield back now.

42:00.912 --> 42:03.497
Any word on Fusco?

42:03.499 --> 42:06.367
Off the hook for now.

42:06.369 --> 42:09.103
My chess partner in prison
says Azarello

42:09.105 --> 42:12.756
had a change of heart
and recanted.

42:12.758 --> 42:15.075
Checkmate.

42:15.077 --> 42:17.428
Good to hear.

42:17.430 --> 42:22.633
That storm on the horizon
that I mentioned,

42:22.635 --> 42:25.936
I'm afraid it's arrived.

42:25.937 --> 42:27.846
_

42:31.109 --> 42:32.893
Finch, where's Bear?

42:32.895 --> 42:35.762
Oh, yes,
that's the other matter

42:35.764 --> 42:38.782
that we need to discuss.

43:00.722 --> 43:03.257
Need some fresh eyes
on a lead I'm running.

43:03.259 --> 43:04.925
You mind giving it a look?

43:04.927 --> 43:06.343
And I'll catch up
with you later.

43:06.345 --> 43:07.461
I had a long night.

43:07.463 --> 43:10.681
Sure, no problem.

43:34.853 --> 43:36.983
