01:21.458 --> 01:25.592
How is it? You get it up?
No, it's a stain. It won't come up.

01:25.617 --> 01:28.873
That's why they're called stains, Viktor.
You need to scrub it harder.

01:28.898 --> 01:30.763
The traders are coming.
No, I need to go home.

01:30.788 --> 01:32.633
I told you I need to leave on time today.

01:32.658 --> 01:35.283
OK, when stain is gone, then you go.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.393
Idiot.

02:32.338 --> 02:35.153
'Spin again.'

02:51.228 --> 02:52.233
Girls!

02:53.867 --> 02:56.672
Come on, we're late! Will you
turn that music off, please?

02:58.388 --> 03:02.123
Come on! Mum, you haven't washed my
leotard. I can't wear it, it stinks!

03:02.148 --> 03:04.953
Well, look, I haven't got any
washing powder at the minute

03:04.978 --> 03:07.363
so you're just going to have
to spray some deodorant on it

03:07.388 --> 03:08.513
or something, all right?

03:08.538 --> 03:11.873
I thought you were cleaning one of
your posher houses this morning -

03:11.898 --> 03:14.233
they make you get dressed
up for it now, is it?

03:14.258 --> 03:17.033
No, because I've got to see your dad.
Come on, please, Lily!

03:19.428 --> 03:23.203
Turn that off. Come on, girls, we
haven't got time for this. Girls.

03:23.228 --> 03:25.363
I'm serious now, come on.

03:28.947 --> 03:32.123
All right, go on, then. Spin round.

03:32.148 --> 03:35.922
Come on, turn it off, please.
No. Get your coats on.

03:38.028 --> 03:40.842
I'm working again tonight. So
you'll have to come straight home

03:40.867 --> 03:43.363
after dance class to watch Lily.
But I had plans tonight.

03:43.388 --> 03:45.233
What, plans with this Jake?

03:45.258 --> 03:46.563
Well, you're not going out.

03:48.338 --> 03:51.123
What's a 17-year-old doing with a
girl two years younger, anyway?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.722
Is he a paedo or something? Mum!

03:52.747 --> 03:54.083
If he touches you,

03:54.108 --> 03:56.792
I'll chop his bloody willy off.

03:58.258 --> 04:01.563
Just be careful, OK? OK.

04:01.588 --> 04:04.483
'Bye, Mum!'

04:04.508 --> 04:07.403
Lily, put that away now, please.
Just a minute.

04:07.428 --> 04:09.313
Put it away or I'll take it off you, OK?

04:09.338 --> 04:11.313
I gave you that phone so
you could speak to me

04:11.338 --> 04:13.123
if you needed anything, not to play games.

04:13.148 --> 04:14.788
Now, come on, out you get, I'm in a rush.

04:16.588 --> 04:18.512
OK, love you both!

04:18.538 --> 04:20.083
Yeah, love you too, Mum.

04:35.058 --> 04:38.842
'Place your bets, please.'

04:41.308 --> 04:45.363
'30, red. Spin again.'

04:51.978 --> 04:53.722
'Player wins.'

04:53.747 --> 04:55.443
Ooh, shit!

04:57.947 --> 05:01.873
What are you doing? No.

05:01.898 --> 05:04.003
Sorry, mate! It's just a little bump!

05:04.028 --> 05:07.763
I'm sure you'll get over it.
Oi! Come back!

05:19.867 --> 05:21.443
Shit.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.363
Five quid? For fuck...

05:36.668 --> 05:39.034
Where the hell have you been?
She's down there waiting for us.

05:39.058 --> 05:42.513
Bloody supervisor always keeping me behind.
What's in the folder?

05:42.538 --> 05:46.163
Just some things I need.
You're 40 minutes late. Great.

05:46.188 --> 05:47.592
Plenty of time for a pee, then.

05:47.617 --> 05:48.617
Y...

06:01.108 --> 06:05.083
So, what we must remember at all
times during our discussion

06:05.108 --> 06:08.363
is why we're here. Alice and Lily.

06:08.388 --> 06:10.873
And that's why I have written
their names on the board.

06:10.898 --> 06:14.873
OK, so, who wants to get
the ball rolling today?

06:14.898 --> 06:18.233
I think maybe I should. I have
something I wanna say. OK. Great.

06:22.898 --> 06:25.592
Well, the thing is, with
the girls, I just...

06:25.617 --> 06:27.233
I don't see how it's gonna work.

06:28.508 --> 06:29.592
How what's going to work?

06:29.617 --> 06:31.363
What we talked about, you know,

06:31.388 --> 06:33.363
splitting the time between the two of us...

06:33.388 --> 06:35.592
I just think that...

06:38.108 --> 06:40.363
You know...
For God's sake, spit it out!

06:41.867 --> 06:44.722
I think the girls should come
and live with me full time.

06:44.747 --> 06:48.233
What? I just think that's
what's best for them.

06:48.258 --> 06:51.163
Not living with their mum, you think
that's what's best for them? Wait...

06:51.188 --> 06:52.883
a minute, Sam. Let Dave finish.

06:52.908 --> 06:54.443
You can't look after them properly.

06:54.468 --> 06:57.133
We've already talked about that
zero hours contract you're on.

06:57.158 --> 06:58.883
You have sex in our bed with another woman

06:58.908 --> 07:00.722
and you think you're
taking the girls off me?

07:00.747 --> 07:03.523
I shouldn't have done that.
But we're both at fault here.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.842
The girls need to come and live with
me and that is the only option.

07:06.867 --> 07:10.443
Dave, why do you feel the girls have
no choice but to live with you?

07:12.908 --> 07:15.083
I know we've already
gone over Sam's gambling

07:15.108 --> 07:18.083
and she doesn't think it's an issue.
It's not. It's not.

07:18.108 --> 07:20.108
I have a little flutter now
and again, that's all.

07:21.188 --> 07:22.643
Is that true? Yes!

07:25.188 --> 07:26.953
I have my post redirected.

07:29.668 --> 07:31.443
And I received this.

07:31.468 --> 07:35.363
It's a court summons for a credit
card that Sam took out in my name.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.443
A card I knew nothing about.

07:37.468 --> 07:40.592
She's racked up over eight
grand in three months.

07:40.617 --> 07:41.953
All from gambling.

07:41.978 --> 07:44.603
That makes it look worse than it is.
You could win that back in no time.

07:44.627 --> 07:46.922
Yeah, and then you'd lose it again.

07:46.947 --> 07:49.003
I have to pay this back.

07:49.028 --> 07:50.953
Not to mention the 15 grand we already owe.

07:50.978 --> 07:53.394
Plus the money I have to fork out
to keep a roof over your head.

07:53.418 --> 07:55.753
Rent you fork out for your
daughters' heads, you mean.

07:55.778 --> 07:57.723
Yeah, but I'm not living
with them, am I? You are.

07:57.747 --> 08:00.852
That woman is not raising my girls.
Over my dead body, is she.

08:02.778 --> 08:05.523
Beth is not going to
replace you as a mother.

08:05.548 --> 08:07.672
But she is going to be part of their lives

08:07.697 --> 08:09.523
and you need to get used to that.

08:09.548 --> 08:12.672
Like hell she is. You are not
taking my girls away from me.

08:40.587 --> 08:44.133
'It's very basic,
very simple, but full of flavour.'

08:44.158 --> 08:46.493
'And it's a family favourite.

08:46.518 --> 08:49.493
'It has to be every time, on
those cold, winter evenings,

08:49.518 --> 08:52.033
'this is just the sort of thing you want.

08:52.058 --> 08:54.363
'Are you a bit of a fan of the hotpot?
I love it.'

08:56.778 --> 09:00.883
Sam, it's Warren.

09:02.747 --> 09:05.323
Look, I know you're in there,
Sam, because the telly's on.

09:07.028 --> 09:08.573
No point hiding.

09:11.138 --> 09:13.493
I'd like to keep things friendly, really.

09:32.388 --> 09:34.033
'Spin again.'

09:36.268 --> 09:41.523
'22, black, even Jess!
Jess, come on!

09:41.548 --> 09:45.083
'The train
arriving on platform two...'

09:45.108 --> 09:47.163
Nearly missed it.

09:49.308 --> 09:51.573
He's not taking my kids
away from me, no way.

09:51.598 --> 09:53.493
Why does he even think that, though?

09:53.518 --> 09:56.103
Well, he thinks I'm gambling again.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.983
Yeah, but you're not, though, are you?
No. Course not.

09:59.008 --> 10:03.413
Anyway, look, how's your mum doing?
Has she worked things out yet?

10:03.438 --> 10:06.983
Yeah, she's all right. But
the cafe's struggling.

10:07.008 --> 10:08.383
The rent's gone up again.

10:08.408 --> 10:13.413
And I think we're going to have
to give it up. No, such a shame.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.513
Well, it is.

10:15.538 --> 10:18.233
But I've got an idea.

10:18.258 --> 10:19.702
A mobile cafe.

10:19.727 --> 10:21.343
Like the ones they have round here.
Yeah.

10:21.368 --> 10:23.344
You know, that way, we can
keep the business going

10:23.368 --> 10:25.103
without having to pay any greedy landlords.

10:25.128 --> 10:26.622
How would you afford it, though?

10:26.647 --> 10:28.513
Well, I've got my dad's inheritance.

10:28.538 --> 10:31.742
It's not a lot, but I reckon
if I save a bit more,

10:31.767 --> 10:34.343
I reckon I could do it.
I think it's a great idea, babe.

10:34.368 --> 10:37.622
Yeah? Yeah. I do. Yeah. Though if
Chris would get his arse in gear,

10:37.647 --> 10:39.183
we could have the money in no time.
!

10:39.208 --> 10:41.583
He needs a good kick up
the backside, that one.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.034
Yeah, don't worry, babe, I'm kicking it.

10:44.059 --> 10:46.074
That's my girl.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.564
You're kidding me. All right?

10:51.589 --> 10:53.644
I ask him why can't he wait
and pee in the toilet?

10:53.669 --> 10:55.034
He says, "It's all the same",

10:55.059 --> 10:57.394
"the pipes are all going the same way."

10:57.419 --> 11:00.673
He holds it in the shower
and pees down the drain.

11:00.698 --> 11:04.484
When Jess was living next door with
her boyfriend, what was his name?

11:04.509 --> 11:07.514
Kevin? Yeah. He used to get
drunk and pee in her wardrobe.

11:07.539 --> 11:10.484
I could hear her shouting
at him through the wall.

11:10.509 --> 11:12.394
In the wardrobe?
Yeah, but only ever on my side.

11:12.419 --> 11:14.754
I'd wake up and find him
peeing all over my clothes.

11:14.779 --> 11:19.954
What a filthy pig. Mine picks his nose.
Eurgh! A nose picker?

11:19.979 --> 11:22.314
We've got one of those on
our floor, don't we, Sam?

11:22.339 --> 11:25.204
Yeah, the Hoover crackles every
time I go past the stairs. ALL!

11:25.229 --> 11:29.234
So many stains to clean on your floor.
Why do they need so many?

11:29.259 --> 11:31.593
Well, to count all of the
millions they're making

11:31.618 --> 11:33.954
from doing bugger all.
Just a bunch of rich guys

11:33.979 --> 11:35.955
getting paid to move even
richer guys' money about.

11:35.979 --> 11:37.843
Viktor, Viktor!

11:37.868 --> 11:39.874
Viktor. Look lively.

11:41.738 --> 11:45.673
Hey, Viktor, I was just wondering...
Have you been hitting the gym?

11:45.698 --> 11:49.234
You're looking really big, very muscular.

11:49.259 --> 11:52.593
Anyway, I was wondering if you had
any hours available, day shifts,

11:52.618 --> 11:54.004
you know, toilet patrol?

11:54.029 --> 11:55.824
For you? No.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.843
I know what you did with the pen.

11:57.868 --> 11:59.484
What pen?

11:59.509 --> 12:02.004
You coloured the carpet with a
pen, it is a different colour.

12:02.029 --> 12:05.314
OK, so I improvised, but I got
rid of the stain, didn't I?

12:05.339 --> 12:08.673
Come on, please, I'm a
little short this month. No.

12:08.698 --> 12:12.114
And you are now on a warning.
I'm watching you, Sam Cook.

12:12.139 --> 12:13.923
Any more trouble and you'll be out.

12:30.748 --> 12:33.114
'Welcome to Ladies' Night Casino.'

12:33.139 --> 12:36.314
'Place your bets, please.'

12:44.818 --> 12:48.004
'30, red, even. Spin again.'

12:53.669 --> 12:57.284
'33. Spin again.'

13:18.389 --> 13:23.084
Hey. Yeah, hey. Erm... Look, did
you clean my office earlier?

13:23.109 --> 13:25.394
Because there are still
ring marks on the desk.

13:25.419 --> 13:27.084
You want me to wipe the desks?

13:27.109 --> 13:29.923
That's part of cleaning, isn't it? Wiping?

13:29.948 --> 13:31.923
Yeah, but I don't touch the desks.

13:31.948 --> 13:34.473
I don't want to mess anything
up because it looks important.

13:37.179 --> 13:39.154
Just make sure you wipe
the desks, all right?

13:39.179 --> 13:41.484
Yeah, hello?

13:41.509 --> 13:44.114
'You all right?'
Yep, I'm still in the office.

13:48.029 --> 13:49.204
There's nobody here.

13:50.979 --> 13:53.754
I think we need to slow down.

13:53.779 --> 13:55.754
But I'm the one taking all the risk here.

13:58.748 --> 14:01.514
Swanny, if I get caught,
it's seven years, minimum.

14:04.259 --> 14:06.803
Yeah, well, you know what, I don't
care what the others think.

14:06.828 --> 14:09.114
It's not a sure thing. I'm
the guy who goes down.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.234
You all make 50 grand.

14:11.948 --> 14:13.644
What are you saying?

14:13.669 --> 14:15.444
So you're blackmailing me?

14:15.469 --> 14:18.234
'Place the investments
and I won't say anything.'

14:21.859 --> 14:26.803
Fine. Just tell me the company.
'OK. Osprex Electronics.

14:26.828 --> 14:29.394
'That's O, S, P, R, E, X. Have you got it?'

14:29.419 --> 14:32.673
Yeah, yes. 'You sure?' Osprex
Electronics. I got it.

14:39.498 --> 14:41.164
'Are you sure you can handle it?'

14:41.189 --> 14:43.723
Look, of course I can handle it.
'Fine. Good.'

14:43.748 --> 14:45.314
I'll call you when it's done.

15:43.189 --> 15:47.723
Hi, Sam. Er... Do you have a minute?
I need to speak with you about Lily.

15:47.748 --> 15:49.244
Yeah, OK.

15:49.269 --> 15:52.164
She thumped her so hard, she
broke Jadine's glasses.

15:52.189 --> 15:54.553
She could have got a
piece stuck in her eye.

15:54.578 --> 15:59.404
Now, I realise they were arguing
and she broke Lily's phone, which,

15:59.429 --> 16:02.364
may I point out, shouldn't
even be in school.

16:02.389 --> 16:04.244
Besides that, I don't think this is the way

16:04.269 --> 16:06.884
Lily should resolve her problems.
Well, no, of course not.

16:06.909 --> 16:09.324
She's in big trouble, don't
you worry about that.

16:09.349 --> 16:11.803
Yes, well, I assume this isn't true,

16:11.828 --> 16:16.194
but Lily says that you were the
one who told her to hit Jadine.

16:16.219 --> 16:18.194
Me?

16:18.219 --> 16:20.764
Yes, she says you told her
you don't start the fights,

16:20.789 --> 16:22.124
but you damn well finish them.

16:22.149 --> 16:25.124
When someone hits you, you hit them back

16:25.149 --> 16:27.723
and she should knock Jadine's block off.

16:27.748 --> 16:30.444
W... Absolutely not.

16:30.469 --> 16:33.324
I would never tell her to
do anything like that.

16:33.349 --> 16:34.723
I did say that, yes,

16:34.748 --> 16:37.654
but what you don't do is go
telling the teacher on me, OK?

16:37.679 --> 16:39.723
Just be good girls, please.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.803
I don't want any more
trouble from that school..

16:42.828 --> 16:47.124
Great! Burnt fish fingers again.
They're not burnt, they're fine.

17:05.069 --> 17:06.069
There.

17:07.578 --> 17:09.834
What do you say? Thanks, Mum.
Yeah, thanks.

17:20.219 --> 17:22.044
No. Hey! No phones
at the dinner table.

17:22.069 --> 17:23.914
I was right in the middle of something.

17:23.939 --> 17:25.655
I know what you were
right in the middle of.

17:25.679 --> 17:27.654
You've got your audition
to be worrying about.

17:27.679 --> 17:31.014
You've got the chance to be in one
of the top dance schools in England.

17:31.039 --> 17:33.164
I don't want you throwing
it away over some boy

17:33.189 --> 17:36.483
who's just trying to get his end away.
He's become a distraction.

17:36.508 --> 17:37.683
Yeah, a distraction from you.

17:46.578 --> 17:49.884
'Red, three. Place your bets.'

17:49.909 --> 17:51.844
'Spin again.'

17:56.349 --> 17:59.164
'Red, 25. Out of funds.'

18:08.929 --> 18:10.573
Mum, look.

18:10.598 --> 18:13.114
Yes, darling?

18:15.528 --> 18:20.474
Is that me and my cleaning gear?
Yeah. It's very good.

18:20.499 --> 18:23.144
I used to have my hair long like this,

18:23.169 --> 18:25.314
until you two girls came along.

18:25.339 --> 18:27.864
Mum, how do I work out the
circumference of a circle again?

18:27.889 --> 18:29.784
Come on, you know this.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.573
You measure the width,
to find the diameter,

18:31.598 --> 18:34.114
then you halve that to
get the radius. Yeah.

18:34.139 --> 18:39.034
So then you use that formula, two
pi R, R is radius. Yeah. Yep.

18:39.059 --> 18:42.424
Mum, you should be a teacher.
You know all the answers.

18:42.449 --> 18:43.904
Bit late for that, sweetheart.

18:46.569 --> 18:49.833
Hey, why don't I see if I can
get this screen fixed for you?

18:50.929 --> 18:52.703
So, girls, I've been thinking,

18:52.728 --> 18:55.984
how would you feel about getting bunk beds?

18:58.089 --> 18:59.654
Bunk beds?
Yeah. You know, with, like,

18:59.679 --> 19:01.703
a little ladder that you can climb up.

19:01.728 --> 19:04.344
How cool would that be? You
can share a room together.

19:04.369 --> 19:05.904
Share a room? What for?

19:05.929 --> 19:08.503
OK, look, I need you to
move into Lily's bedroom

19:08.528 --> 19:10.623
and I don't want any complaining about it.

19:10.648 --> 19:12.344
I'm going to get a lodger in.

19:12.369 --> 19:14.424
But this has to be a
secret from your dad, OK?

19:14.449 --> 19:16.264
It's just for a short while.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.583
This is shit.

19:18.608 --> 19:21.144
Alice!

19:27.679 --> 19:29.944
You all right, love?

19:29.969 --> 19:31.784
Sorry I've been so long.

19:31.809 --> 19:33.194
Is everything OK? Yeah.

19:33.219 --> 19:36.503
No, actually, the grinder's
been playing up again.

19:36.528 --> 19:38.864
I think we need Tony to come
in and take another look.

19:38.889 --> 19:41.753
Nah, just gotta poke it with a
screwdriver, works all right for me.

19:41.778 --> 19:43.784
Yeah, and I told you, you
shouldn't be doing that.

19:43.809 --> 19:46.583
You're gonna lose your hand in there
one of these days. It's fine.

19:46.608 --> 19:48.224
I've still got another one.

19:48.249 --> 19:50.129
I'll give it a poke once
I've had a cup of tea.

19:52.778 --> 19:53.864
I

19:54.969 --> 19:56.114
How was he?

19:58.929 --> 19:59.929
The same.

20:01.858 --> 20:03.864
I don't know why I bother.

20:03.889 --> 20:05.034
He didn't want to talk,

20:05.059 --> 20:08.194
just stared out the window,
watching a man cutting the grass.

20:08.219 --> 20:09.344
Riveting.

20:10.528 --> 20:12.344
Maybe you should go and see him.

20:12.369 --> 20:14.014
He's still your brother.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.945
What are you doing here? I've
been trying to get hold of you,

20:24.969 --> 20:26.194
maybe you missed my calls.

20:26.219 --> 20:27.424
We need to talk, you got time?

20:27.449 --> 20:29.305
No, now's not a good time.
I've gotta go to work.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.833
I understand it must be difficult,

20:30.858 --> 20:33.833
juggling work, looking after those
girls, but I really need that money.

20:33.858 --> 20:36.144
So it'll be 17,000 you owe Mr Carter now.

20:36.169 --> 20:37.864
What happened to our payment plan?

20:37.889 --> 20:40.224
I think my hearing aid's Playing up.

20:40.249 --> 20:42.664
You mean the one you failed to
pay for the last two months?

20:42.689 --> 20:45.344
Look, I told you, I'm on my own now, but...

20:45.369 --> 20:49.753
I'm expecting a cheque from my
ex-husband, divorce settlement.

20:49.778 --> 20:51.754
He owes me thousands. As
soon as that comes through,

20:51.778 --> 20:54.344
I'll get back on track. When?
About a week or so.

20:54.369 --> 20:55.554
OK, well, when it arrives,

20:55.579 --> 20:58.194
I want this month's payment, plus
the last two that you missed.

20:58.219 --> 21:00.503
That's £1,500. Do you understand?

21:00.528 --> 21:02.703
I don't want Mr Carter to
send me to your door again.

21:02.728 --> 21:05.009
It's not nice for either of us, is it?
It's embarrassing.

22:26.969 --> 22:31.864
Yeah? Firm... Glynn? Yeah, it's me, erm...
Wow. Sorry.

22:31.889 --> 22:34.424
I can't believe it. Erm...
ls now a good time?

22:34.449 --> 22:38.583
I know you said five, but...
No, don't be silly, this is great.

22:38.608 --> 22:42.114
Well, come in, what can I get you?
A tea? A coffee?

22:42.139 --> 22:43.224
How's your sister?

22:43.249 --> 22:45.784
There's wardrobes here
with plenty of hangers,

22:45.809 --> 22:49.144
and drawers there for your
socks and pants, or whatever.

22:49.169 --> 22:51.703
And the bathroom's just behind you.

22:51.728 --> 22:53.304
Didn't you say I had my own bathroom?

22:53.329 --> 22:55.194
I thought you said it was ensuite?

22:55.219 --> 22:57.799
Well, it sort of is ensuite, isn't it?
I mean, it's right there.

22:57.824 --> 22:59.105
Can't get much closer than that.

23:00.519 --> 23:01.935
Yeah, I suppose, yeah.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.704
So, a PhD?

23:04.729 --> 23:07.775
A right little brainbox, ain't you?
Are you still into your magic?

23:07.800 --> 23:11.655
You used to love all that.
Card tricks and whatnot.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.624
Er... No. Not any more. Erm...

23:14.649 --> 23:17.055
You mentioned something
about extra storage space.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.985
I notice that there's a shed in the garden.

23:19.010 --> 23:21.775
I just wondered how much space there was.
I just have a few things.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.135
Well, I can get that shed cleared, yeah.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.745
What sort of stuff are we talking about?

23:25.769 --> 23:27.465
Er... Just a few tools, scaffold planks.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.935
Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.

23:28.960 --> 23:32.015
Yeah, and a cement mixer, small
and medium-sized breakers,

23:32.040 --> 23:34.824
two diesel power generators.
Some electrical cable.

23:34.849 --> 23:37.295
Circuit board and soldering
irons, disco lights,

23:37.320 --> 23:39.704
karaoke machine, and a set of speakers.

23:39.729 --> 23:43.775
And, yeah, three... no... four lawn mowers.

23:43.800 --> 23:48.345
What is it you need four lawnmowers 'fir?
I'm fixing them.

23:48.370 --> 23:50.935
That's just what I do for money.
Helps me pay for my PhD.

23:50.960 --> 23:51.985
Got you.

23:56.570 --> 23:57.985
What the fu...

24:01.570 --> 24:04.824
What the hell's going on?
Dance got cancelled. Yeah.

24:04.849 --> 24:08.345
Miss Winter was sick all over Vicky.
Called me to pick 'em up.

24:08.370 --> 24:10.374
They called you? Yes.

24:10.399 --> 24:11.824
Who called?

24:11.849 --> 24:12.905
I did.

24:14.399 --> 24:17.295
We went shopping and everything.
Look what Dad got me.

24:17.320 --> 24:20.265
This one has the best camera.
Well, that's good, then.

24:20.290 --> 24:23.775
Just a little £10 a month contract.
Don't worry, I'll pay for it.

24:25.290 --> 24:28.130
Listen, I just need to have a little
chat with your mum, all right? OK?

24:29.370 --> 24:31.185
See you at the weekend.

24:31.210 --> 24:32.345
Bye, Dad. Bye.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.855
So this is your plan now, is it?
Gonna buy their affections now?

24:39.880 --> 24:43.105
Like I don't pay for everything as it is?
Don't paint me as a bad guy.

24:43.130 --> 24:45.744
I'm not the one who hired some
bullshit massage therapist

24:45.769 --> 24:48.265
for his sports injury and then
shagged her, that was you.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.704
Well... I know we've tried this
before and you don't accept it,

24:53.729 --> 24:55.985
but I don't know, maybe
you'll change our mind.

25:00.649 --> 25:02.935
I don't want to take them
away just to punish you.

25:04.450 --> 25:06.015
I just don't want them getting hurt.

25:20.130 --> 25:25.145
Mu-u-u-u-u-u-u-um! Shit! Sorry,
darling, hang on a minute.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.935
Who the hell is this and why
is he in my room? OK, erm...

25:30.960 --> 25:33.624
Look, you remember my
friend, dance friend Sarah?

25:33.649 --> 25:36.295
Well, you probably don't. Well,
this is her younger brother Glynn.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.495
He's come to look at the room.

25:37.519 --> 25:39.295
He's really good at fixing things

25:39.320 --> 25:41.655
and, you know, be good
to have around, right?

25:41.680 --> 25:45.465
My dad wouldn't chuck me out my own room.
This is a joke.

25:45.490 --> 25:46.624
Alice.

25:46.649 --> 25:51.105
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Don't be, don't be.
So... Well, what do you think?

25:51.130 --> 25:53.985
Er... Yeah, yeah, it's good. Erm...

25:54.010 --> 25:57.215
I was just wondering, is there
a Nando's nearby? Nando's?

25:57.240 --> 25:59.374
Er... Yeah, I think there's
one on the high street,

25:59.399 --> 26:00.655
about a ten minute walk away.

26:00.680 --> 26:01.704
Ten minutes?

26:01.729 --> 26:03.785
OK, erm...

26:03.810 --> 26:05.215
Yeah, I'll take it.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.735
Well, great. Yeah.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.465
Insider trading happens

26:35.490 --> 26:38.015
when somebody with non-public information

26:38.040 --> 26:40.465
trades on that information, makes money,

26:40.490 --> 26:43.574
thus having an unfair advantage
over everybody else.

26:43.599 --> 26:46.935
This highly illegal activity
can be pretty lucrative.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.704
But if caught, it comes with

26:48.729 --> 26:51.065
a punishment of up to
seven years in prison.

26:51.090 --> 26:53.345
Sorry, can I help you with something?
Erm...

26:53.370 --> 26:55.824
I'm looking for some info on banking.

26:55.849 --> 26:58.225
Stocks and shares, that sort of thing.

26:58.250 --> 27:02.905
I had a look online, but I need more
details. OK, what kind of details?

27:02.930 --> 27:04.425
Well, how it all works, you know?

27:04.450 --> 27:06.475
Buy, buy, buy, sell, sell,
sell, and all that.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.425
I'm, erm... I'm looking to invest.

27:08.450 --> 27:10.425
I see.

27:10.450 --> 27:12.425
Please follow me. Thanks.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.985
Where are you going? I'm going out.
What do you mean?

27:32.010 --> 27:34.185
You and Lily have dance
class in 20 minutes.

27:34.210 --> 27:36.985
Yeah, I'm not doing dance
any more, I've had enough.

27:37.010 --> 27:39.865
When was this decided? Er... Since
I've been living here with you

27:39.890 --> 27:41.504
so I never get to do anything

27:41.529 --> 27:43.185
because I always have to look after Lily.

27:43.210 --> 27:45.375
Don't worry, I'll be home
before you have to go to work.

27:45.399 --> 27:47.145
Darling, listen to me, I know you're upset

27:47.170 --> 27:49.655
because of everything that's going on,

27:49.680 --> 27:52.095
but none of this is anybody's fault, OK?

27:54.170 --> 27:55.785
I think it's your fault.

28:12.337 --> 28:15.521
Lily, what are you doing out of bed?
I can't sleep.

28:15.546 --> 28:18.692
Well, you've got school in the
morning, darling. Go on, up you go.

28:20.517 --> 28:21.521
What's the matter?

28:23.187 --> 28:25.442
Come on, what is it?

28:25.467 --> 28:28.802
We're not going to be
moving away from you. What?

28:28.827 --> 28:30.162
Who said that?

28:30.187 --> 28:33.802
Heard Dad talking about maybe me and
Alice moving away with him and Beth.

28:33.827 --> 28:36.082
But what's going to happen to you?

28:36.107 --> 28:37.771
Come here.

28:40.237 --> 28:43.362
Look, I am not going anywhere. OK?

28:43.387 --> 28:45.282
You have got nothing to worry about.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.132
Everything's gonna be fine.

28:59.666 --> 29:02.721
'Business news on CB Radio.'

29:02.746 --> 29:06.802
'Osprex Electronics shares
have risen overnight by over 15%

29:06.827 --> 29:10.802
'as the British company merges
with American firm Panatronics.

29:10.827 --> 29:12.771
'Elsewhere, there's been
a drop in Bitcoin...'

29:39.077 --> 29:43.282
No, of course it's...
That's not the issue here.

29:43.307 --> 29:45.721
The problem is, regardless
of what this report says,

29:45.746 --> 29:48.641
if we invest too much,
it will link back to us.

30:26.347 --> 30:28.882
Sorry. Thank you.

30:42.957 --> 30:45.601
Hey, babe. I've finished the kitchen now.
Are you done in here?

30:45.626 --> 30:47.932
I'm done. Yeah, yeah, I'm done.
Cool.

30:47.957 --> 30:49.322
Actually...

30:49.347 --> 30:51.212
Do you fancy a quick drink?

30:51.237 --> 30:54.882
An insider trader? Yeah. But I
thought he was a stockbroker.

30:54.907 --> 30:57.802
Well, he is a stockbroker, but
he's also an insider trader.

30:57.827 --> 31:01.412
You know Gordon Gekko in
that film Wall Street?

31:01.437 --> 31:05.651
Obviously not. Anyway, he trades
on the inside. Inside of what?

31:05.676 --> 31:08.721
Inside of the information that he has.
Well, what information?

31:08.746 --> 31:10.492
The information, Jess.

31:10.517 --> 31:14.412
The information he has from trading
on the inside. That's how it works.

31:14.437 --> 31:18.082
Look, OK, these insider traders have info

31:18.107 --> 31:20.651
that the public don't know about.

31:20.676 --> 31:24.851
They then invest that info
into the stock market. Bingo.

31:24.876 --> 31:26.802
The value of whatever
they've bought goes up

31:26.827 --> 31:28.802
cos they knew it was gonna go up.

31:28.827 --> 31:31.012
They have the information.
That's how it works.

31:31.037 --> 31:33.851
That's how they get rich.
But how do they get the information?

31:33.876 --> 31:35.601
Well, they share it with each other.

31:35.626 --> 31:39.132
So, like, if somebody knows a
company's gonna get bought out,

31:39.157 --> 31:41.082
they know their stocks will rise.

31:41.107 --> 31:44.721
So then he passes the info on. I
mean, it's all very hush-hush.

31:44.746 --> 31:49.292
So it's against the law? Yeah, big
time, like, ten years in prison.

31:49.317 --> 31:52.492
Very illegal. And the guy who
always works late, he's doing this?

31:52.517 --> 31:54.412
I heard him, yeah.

31:54.437 --> 31:58.802
So... So what, you want to call the police?
The police? No.

31:58.827 --> 32:01.932
Don't you get it? There
is money to be made here.

32:01.957 --> 32:04.292
But you just told me it was illegal.
If we get caught.

32:04.317 --> 32:06.771
But we're just a couple of cleaners.

32:06.796 --> 32:09.412
And just think, if this does
work, you'll have the money

32:09.437 --> 32:12.802
for your van before you know it.
No-one's gonna know.

32:12.827 --> 32:15.323
That's the kind of thing my brother
would say. And look where he is.

32:15.347 --> 32:17.322
Come on, this is totally different.

32:17.347 --> 32:19.132
Look, why should these greedy bastards

32:19.157 --> 32:20.771
be the ones to cut corners and get rich

32:20.796 --> 32:22.412
and we're the ones who get shafted?

32:22.437 --> 32:23.932
You know why - cos we're scared.

32:25.597 --> 32:30.601
So... you want us to listen to
stock market tips at the office?

32:30.626 --> 32:32.731
Well, how would we do it?

32:32.756 --> 32:34.601
Well, I have one idea.

32:37.467 --> 32:40.412
Alice is just going through a phase.
Do you remember when I was younger

32:40.437 --> 32:42.162
and I really wanted to be a roller-skater?

32:42.187 --> 32:44.772
I thought it was going to be well
cool, and I'd skate everywhere.

32:44.796 --> 32:49.771
And then I met Kevin Barker. And...
Yeah, well, I gave up.

32:49.796 --> 32:51.963
Skating was a lot harder than
I thought it was gonna be.

32:51.987 --> 32:54.802
Well, thanks, Jess, that
makes me feel so much better.

32:54.827 --> 32:57.442
These instructions aren't in English, babe.

32:57.467 --> 32:59.492
Well, I bought it real cheap on eBay.

32:59.517 --> 33:01.242
Cost more for the postage and packaging.

33:02.347 --> 33:05.132
Come on, I'm sure I can make this work.

33:05.157 --> 33:09.052
Where's all the pictures?
OK, look, let's just try.

33:09.077 --> 33:10.682
There's the on button. Ready?

33:11.907 --> 33:15.882
Testing, testing, one, two, three.
I can't hear anything.

33:15.907 --> 33:17.132
Total crap.

33:17.157 --> 33:19.522
Look, maybe if we're going to
do this, we should do it right,

33:19.546 --> 33:21.882
and, like, you know, pay for
one that actually works?

33:27.477 --> 33:29.652
Sorry, that was my fault, I
just dropped a photocopier.

33:29.676 --> 33:31.132
It's all OK.

33:35.397 --> 33:39.372
Yeah, it's kind of old and a cable
came loose during shipping,

33:39.397 --> 33:44.521
but... yeah, I think it should be OK.

33:44.546 --> 33:45.932
Yeah.

33:45.957 --> 33:49.242
What, it works? Yeah. It should be
fine for what you need, I think.

33:49.267 --> 33:51.883
OK, so how close do I need to get
the microphone so I can hear him?

33:51.907 --> 33:53.012
As close as possible,

33:53.037 --> 33:56.062
but it'll pick up anything
from 10ft quite clearly.

33:56.087 --> 34:00.212
Well, that should be fine.
Great. Thank you.

34:00.237 --> 34:02.682
OK, why don't I go
upstairs and demonstrate?

34:02.707 --> 34:05.323
You use the headphones and then you
can shout up if you can hear me.

34:05.347 --> 34:06.962
Great idea. Cool OK, thanks.

34:09.067 --> 34:11.601
I thought you weren't telling
anyone about this. We're not.

34:11.626 --> 34:13.681
Well, how come Glynn knows?
He doesn't.

34:13.706 --> 34:17.292
I told him we needed the listening
device to spy on your boyfriend.

34:17.317 --> 34:19.411
That we think he's cheating on you.
What?

34:19.437 --> 34:20.492
'OK, I'm in the bedroom,

34:20.516 --> 34:22.292
'talking about 5ft from the microphone.

34:22.317 --> 34:24.453
'Shout if you can hear me.'
Yeah, you're coming through.

34:24.476 --> 34:25.683
What did you tell him that for?

34:25.706 --> 34:27.851
Well, what else? I had to
come up with something.

34:27.876 --> 34:30.292
And besides, who knows
what your Chris gets up to.

34:30.317 --> 34:33.292
'OK, I'm about 10ft from
the mic now. Can you still hear me?'

34:33.317 --> 34:35.452
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're
still coming through.

34:35.476 --> 34:37.212
'I just, er... I just wanted to say,

34:37.237 --> 34:39.371
'I am sure you're just
being paranoid, Jess.

34:39.397 --> 34:43.172
'I'd be surprised if your boyfriend
really was cheating on you.'

34:43.197 --> 34:44.681
Can't believe you told him that.

34:44.706 --> 34:47.882
Couldn't you have thought
of something else? What?

34:47.907 --> 34:50.882
Thanks so much for doing that.
That's brilliant. Yeah, no problem.

34:50.907 --> 34:53.242
I could even help you plant
the microphone if you need?

34:53.266 --> 34:55.812
No, no, that's fine. We can, erm...
handle it from here.

35:19.676 --> 35:21.322
I'll just be another hour or two.

35:21.347 --> 35:24.572
'I'll put your dinner on and
leave it in the oven.' Yeah.

35:24.597 --> 35:26.322
'Still busy?' Yes.

35:27.477 --> 35:30.372
It's crazy busy out here.
'All right, babe. Love you.'

35:30.397 --> 35:32.042
Yeah, you too.

35:48.957 --> 35:50.851
I don't understand.

35:50.876 --> 35:52.452
Why can't we wait for another night?

35:52.477 --> 35:54.292
When he's not here? That'd be easier.

35:54.317 --> 35:56.892
No, because he's working late
tonight to talk insider deals.

35:56.917 --> 35:59.932
I want to hear what he's saying. If
we wait, I might miss my chance.

36:09.707 --> 36:13.092
Looks like now's that chance.
What? Wait there. No, Sam!

36:13.117 --> 36:14.452
Cover for me if he comes.

36:18.317 --> 36:20.422
OK. Erm...

36:27.987 --> 36:29.531
No, it's too big.

36:55.197 --> 36:56.197
Shit.

36:58.917 --> 36:59.917
OK.

37:26.556 --> 37:28.172
God, come on.

37:40.167 --> 37:41.531
Yes.

37:59.277 --> 38:03.582
Hey, erm... I haven't wiped your desk yet.

38:03.607 --> 38:06.372
Erm... I thought now might be a good time?

38:06.397 --> 38:07.731
Well...

38:07.756 --> 38:09.502
Do you want me to wipe it now?

38:09.527 --> 38:12.531
It's just, if you're busy,
it's OK, I can wait,

38:12.556 --> 38:14.972
I just... I didn't want you
to think that I'd forgotten.

38:14.997 --> 38:17.531
Cos I hadn't... haven't forgotten.

38:17.556 --> 38:20.611
I just was waiting for you to
go to the toilet or something.

38:20.636 --> 38:23.692
Do you need the toilet?
I've just been to the toilet.

38:23.717 --> 38:25.142
OK.

38:25.167 --> 38:28.142
Look, you know what, I'll let you
know when I need my office cleaned.

38:28.167 --> 38:30.892
Right. Got it.

38:30.917 --> 38:33.252
One second!

38:33.277 --> 38:34.372
Erm...

38:34.397 --> 38:35.582
Your flies...

38:38.636 --> 38:40.252
They're fine.

38:41.636 --> 38:42.731
Sorry.

38:59.408 --> 39:01.552
All right. Who are you thinking?

39:06.247 --> 39:09.713
Bevan Brothers Steel...
has an imminent takeover.

39:09.738 --> 39:10.913
'Yeah?'

39:10.938 --> 39:17.513
Steel. 'No. I'm going to need
to open more accounts, OK?'

39:19.048 --> 39:21.663
I can't believe we're actually doing this.
So what happens now?

39:21.688 --> 39:22.743
How do we get the money?

39:22.768 --> 39:25.102
We'll have to set up an account
with an online broker,

39:25.127 --> 39:27.913
they handle the transaction, we
just need to make an investment.

39:27.938 --> 39:31.406
OK, so how much are we gonna invest?
That depends on you.

39:31.431 --> 39:33.253
Why does it depend on me?

39:33.278 --> 39:35.443
Well, all of my credit cards
are kind of maxed out.

39:35.468 --> 39:36.853
So I was thinking... k?

39:36.878 --> 39:39.253
Well, yeah, you've got that
money in your savings.

39:39.278 --> 39:41.613
Look, don't worry, OK?
This is a sure thing.

39:41.638 --> 39:42.973
You won't lose a penny.

39:44.748 --> 39:47.693
OK, so the Bevan Brothers
Steel shares cost £10 each.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.003
How many do we want?

39:49.028 --> 39:52.923
Well, how about for this first time
we just be careful and just test it,

39:52.948 --> 39:55.723
see if it works?
Yeah, well, test it with how many?

39:55.748 --> 39:59.443
How about one for now?
One share?! Yeah.

39:59.468 --> 40:01.332
Well, there's no point.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.693
We can't waste this opportunity.
One share is no good.

40:03.718 --> 40:06.004
Yeah, but how do we know for
sure it's even going to work?

40:06.028 --> 40:07.923
Imminent takeover, that's what he said.

40:07.948 --> 40:10.423
We buy now, it gets announced,
and the stocks will go up.

40:10.448 --> 40:12.133
This is what insider trading's all about.

40:12.158 --> 40:14.493
But we're not insider traders.
We're just cleaners.

40:14.518 --> 40:17.118
Look, one share, £10, that's all I
want to risk. Five shares, £50.

40:18.798 --> 40:21.643
If it doesn't come off, I'll pay
you back, but it will come off.

40:21.668 --> 40:24.773
OK, five shares. But I
want it all back, Sam.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.693
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you'll get it.

40:28.237 --> 40:30.212
What are you doing? What?

40:30.237 --> 40:32.773
That's 50.
Yeah, that's what you said, £50.

40:32.798 --> 40:36.412
No, no, no, that's 50 shares, that's £500.
That's too much.

40:36.437 --> 40:39.133
OK... Well, look, it's the same deal.

40:40.278 --> 40:42.803
Look, please don't worry.
I'll pay you back, OK?

40:45.357 --> 40:47.773
So what happens now?

40:47.798 --> 40:50.893
Well, I've placed an order, and
then we just have to, you know,

40:50.918 --> 40:53.282
see what happens when the
takeover gets announced.

41:16.278 --> 41:18.332
This phone won't wipe.

41:18.357 --> 41:22.133
Wipe, wipe, wipe some. Wipe, wipe, wipe.
Phone when you finish.

41:24.518 --> 41:26.412
'Place your bets, please.'

41:33.998 --> 41:39.133
'19. Red. Odd. Spin again.'

42:19.678 --> 42:23.443
Er... Come on. It's
getting late, sweetheart.

42:23.468 --> 42:26.973
Come on, you can finish this when
you get home from school tomorrow.

42:26.998 --> 42:31.493
Ten more minutes. No, you've had ten
more minutes. Come on, in you get.

42:31.518 --> 42:35.853
Grr. I like it when you don't have work.
I get tucked in properly.

42:35.878 --> 42:38.332
Mwah! Love you.

42:38.357 --> 42:40.332
Sleep well, darling.

42:43.598 --> 42:45.854
Lily's going to sleep now so
if you're going to be in here,

42:45.878 --> 42:47.958
keep the noise down, please.
No phone calls to Jake.

42:51.678 --> 42:52.883
I do love you, you know.

42:54.437 --> 42:56.573
Night, Mum.

42:56.598 --> 42:57.623
Good night, sweetheart.

43:04.878 --> 43:07.803
What are you doing? Why do
you need your bag? Nothing.

43:07.828 --> 43:09.653
Go to sleep.

43:22.437 --> 43:25.723
There you go. Let me know
what you think about this.

43:25.748 --> 43:27.443
It's a new recipe I'm playing with.

43:34.107 --> 43:35.412
What the hell is this?

43:35.437 --> 43:39.883
It's carrot and ginger with a
pineapple slice. Carrots? Yeah.

43:41.468 --> 43:44.212
What, you never had carrot cake before?
Course I have.

43:44.237 --> 43:45.523
Just don't agree with it.

43:45.548 --> 43:48.332
I like my carrots next to my
peas on a nice Sunday roast,

43:48.357 --> 43:51.263
and that's where they belong,
to Jamie Oliver over there!

43:51.288 --> 43:54.493
'Red Giant Steel has merged with
Scottish company Bevan Brothers.'

43:54.518 --> 43:58.853
Wait, go back. What? Go back,
go back, I went to see that.

43:58.878 --> 44:01.623
Business news?

44:01.648 --> 44:03.983
What you doing? '..Leaders,

44:04.008 --> 44:06.013
'with forecasters
optimistically predicting...'

44:06.038 --> 44:07.883
Since when were you
interested in this crap?

44:07.908 --> 44:10.342
'..Number one steel
manufacturer in the world.'

44:16.187 --> 44:18.773
Jess? The takeover, it's
been announced. When?

44:18.798 --> 44:23.803
I don't know, I'm watching it
on TV right now. Which channel?

44:23.828 --> 44:25.573
It's on 103.

44:25.598 --> 44:27.883
'For shareholders in Bevan Brothers Steel,

44:27.908 --> 44:29.523
'today's announcement is good news

44:29.548 --> 44:31.933
'as the share price began
to climb...' Yeah!

44:31.958 --> 44:34.092
'..Rapidly before the market
closed this afternoon.'

44:34.117 --> 44:38.733
We're looking at 45, maybe even 50%.
That's just a prediction.

44:38.758 --> 44:41.653
Which means around 70 grand each.

44:43.288 --> 44:45.292
Well, we will find that
out tomorrow, my friend.

44:45.317 --> 44:49.703
So, how much have we made?
Erm... Hang on.

44:51.548 --> 44:53.453
Erm...

44:53.478 --> 44:54.933
Come on.

44:58.628 --> 45:03.523
Holy shit, Jess. We've made,
like, over £250 already.

45:05.317 --> 45:08.133
And it will probably go up even
more tomorrow. It's worked!

45:08.158 --> 45:10.133
Mum. What?

45:11.878 --> 45:14.703
What is it, Lily? It's Alice.

45:14.728 --> 45:17.883
OK, I'll speak then.
