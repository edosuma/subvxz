00:00.735 --> 00:02.868
<i> Previously on Van Helsing!</i>

00:02.870 --> 00:04.036
Susan?

00:04.038 --> 00:07.272
( Fighting grunts )

00:07.274 --> 00:09.541
( Screams )

00:10.511 --> 00:11.643
It's true.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.178
Get ready to run!

00:13.180 --> 00:15.047
One of ours was killed
before you got here.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.449
Whoever did it, took a finger,
just like this.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.954
I remember your scent.

00:21.956 --> 00:22.921
Hey!

00:23.958 --> 00:24.957
This is only temporary

00:24.959 --> 00:26.825
until we find out who
the real killer is.

00:26.827 --> 00:27.826
I did.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.828
I killed those people.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.598
We break in through here.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.867
We are up and in without them
even knowing.

00:34.869 --> 00:35.868
Now!

00:37.538 --> 00:40.239
( Growling and snarling )

00:40.241 --> 00:43.909
Fresh meat to the one
who brings her to me.

00:43.911 --> 00:44.710
( Snarling )

00:44.712 --> 00:45.844
Run!!!

00:55.689 --> 01:02.061
( Gasping )

01:13.007 --> 01:16.675
( Snarling )

01:16.677 --> 01:17.910
Let's go!

01:28.556 --> 01:30.089
( Vampire shrieks )

01:35.062 --> 01:37.129
( Vampire shrieks )

01:37.131 --> 01:39.231
Get back!

01:39.233 --> 01:40.432
Shit!

01:40.434 --> 01:41.934
Come on!

01:47.508 --> 01:49.575
( Feral snarling )

01:49.577 --> 01:50.976
( Screaming )

01:50.978 --> 01:53.912
( Feral snarling )

01:59.186 --> 02:00.853
( Screams )

02:02.356 --> 02:04.156
( Screeching )

02:14.568 --> 02:20.405
( Snarling )

02:20.407 --> 02:23.108
( Screams )

02:27.748 --> 02:29.114
( Screams )

02:34.622 --> 02:37.022
Vanessa!

02:37.024 --> 02:38.757
Vanessa!

02:41.495 --> 02:42.961
( Choking )

02:42.963 --> 02:45.664
Va- Vanessa!

02:45.666 --> 02:48.467
Please- please- Vanessa...

02:48.469 --> 02:53.906
Please... please, it's me...

02:53.908 --> 02:59.278
Susan... Susan...

02:59.280 --> 03:03.048
( Sobbing )

03:09.456 --> 03:13.559
Oh, Susan.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.961
I'm sorry.

03:15.963 --> 03:16.695
It's ok.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.496
I'm sorry.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.499
It's ok.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.501
I'm getting us out of here.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.137
Ok, sure.

03:25.139 --> 03:26.038
Woah!

03:28.042 --> 03:29.508
It's ok.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.777
It's ok.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.645
You rest now.

03:37.551 --> 03:41.053
Remember you used to sing
this to your little girl.

03:44.558 --> 03:50.495
Twinkle, twinkle,
little star,

03:50.497 --> 03:55.767
how I wonder what you are.

03:55.769 --> 04:00.405
Up above the world so high,

04:00.407 --> 04:05.744
like a diamond in the sky.

04:05.746 --> 04:14.886
Twinkle, twinkle,
little star...

04:14.888 --> 04:17.556
( Screeching )

04:34.475 --> 04:36.408
I wonder what's in there.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.609
I don't know.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.444
They told me to stay close
to everyone else.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.079
You know, it's probably
more food.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.314
Supplies.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.850
All the stuff they didn't want
us to find out about before.

04:44.852 --> 04:45.951
Gosh.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.152
Do you think it's ever going
to be the same again?

04:47.154 --> 04:50.322
Like, the world I mean.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.090
Of course it will be, sweetie.

04:52.092 --> 04:55.794
Really?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.963
Absolutely.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.264
All this bad stuff?

04:59.266 --> 05:02.267
It's only temporary.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.535
I can feel it.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.392
Maybe it's really a toy store
with toys and candy

05:27.394 --> 05:28.694
and stuff like that!

05:28.696 --> 05:29.961
( Laughs )

05:31.799 --> 05:33.365
Callie!

05:37.771 --> 05:39.638
( Screams )

05:42.109 --> 05:50.716
( Starts sobbing )

05:50.718 --> 05:51.249
You ok?

05:51.251 --> 05:52.551
Can you keep going?

05:52.553 --> 05:53.652
Look who's talking.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.520
I'm fine.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.222
I'd throw you over my shoulder
and carry you myself

05:57.224 --> 06:00.726
but I'd probably resent your
ass for like six months or so.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.661
We wouldn't want that.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.331
Ok look, these numbers.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.632
They correspond to streets.

06:07.634 --> 06:08.900
Really?

06:08.902 --> 06:11.236
Yeah, my old bus route,
remember?

06:11.238 --> 06:12.471
Yeah.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.240
Downtown is on a grid so if
i remember correctly we just...

06:15.242 --> 06:17.075
We're close.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.210
A few more blocks underground

06:18.212 --> 06:20.145
and we should be able
to go topside.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.417
We could risk it now.

06:25.419 --> 06:28.153
But no doubt we're
being tracked.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.188
We're better off staying
underground as long as we can.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.390
Yeah.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.558
These things down here...

06:33.560 --> 06:35.127
I need a minute.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.700
Susan, listen.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.335
If something happens, ok,

06:43.337 --> 06:46.938
if we get split up or whatever
and you find Dylan before me,

06:46.940 --> 06:50.842
I just... I need you...

06:50.844 --> 06:52.611
I need you to tell her
that I'm alive.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.547
Ok? And that I'm searching
for her.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.948
And that I will find her.

06:56.950 --> 06:57.849
Ok? I will.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.785
Ok.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.486
But we're gonna get
out of here.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.021
For Dylan.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.457
And you can tell her
your damn self.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.660
Ok?

07:08.662 --> 07:09.428
Mmmhmm.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.796
Mmmhmm.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.970
And yes, ok, we never should
have taken the keys, ok?

07:18.972 --> 07:24.543
I know that, but... come on.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.110
Come on!

07:25.112 --> 07:27.212
You don't...

07:27.214 --> 07:30.215
This guy has booby-trapped
the entire hospital

07:30.217 --> 07:33.118
and Callie walked
right into it!

07:33.120 --> 07:37.122
Thank god she's so tiny
or she...

07:37.124 --> 07:42.093
It- it would have
torn her in half.

07:42.095 --> 07:45.230
( Starts sobbing )

08:24.338 --> 08:26.037
I want to know what happened.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.508
The hell that you've got
going around here.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.375
I'm gonna need you
to be

08:30.377 --> 08:32.677
a bit more specific than
that, big guy.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.548
( Groans )

08:45.893 --> 08:47.325
I seriously have no idea
what you're talking about.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.661
Your stupid traps, asshole.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.897
All the shit you've hung up
and hidden away around here,

08:51.899 --> 08:53.031
that's what.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.165
Why's that?

08:54.167 --> 08:57.469
Because you almost killed
a little girl, that's why.

08:57.471 --> 08:58.470
Where was this?

08:58.472 --> 08:59.871
Why does that matter?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.006
Just asking.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.241
The south side of the building.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.744
The blood bank
or whatever it is.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.012
Well you ought to teach her
to read

09:07.014 --> 09:09.214
because I put a sign on the door
that clearly says "keep out".

09:09.216 --> 09:10.415
You asshole!

09:11.518 --> 09:12.851
I got this.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.855
I'm gonna need a list of
every gadget

09:16.857 --> 09:18.723
you've stashed
around this place.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.959
Why would I do something
stupid like that?

09:20.961 --> 09:22.327
Because that's the only
way a group of people

09:22.329 --> 09:25.263
trying to live here can safely
go about their daily lives.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.265
That is why.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.606
You got a pencil?

09:34.608 --> 09:35.740
I do.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.743
Great. Take it and jam it up
your ass.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.946
( Groans )

09:46.553 --> 09:48.053
( Moans )

09:51.692 --> 09:53.325
You're such a tough guy,

09:53.327 --> 09:56.261
but you're gonna tell me
in the end anyway.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.965
Why, so you can take
this place over for good?

09:59.967 --> 10:02.233
We already have taken
over this place.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.768
For good.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.103
( Groans )

10:17.217 --> 10:19.484
Does taka even know
we're doing this?

10:19.486 --> 10:22.320
Do you think I would risk
being here without telling him?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.321
Where is he?

10:23.323 --> 10:25.957
He's planning.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.060
He's looking at
the big picture.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.831
All I care about is getting
free of here.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.501
Of them.

10:36.503 --> 10:39.337
Does he have a grand plan
about that, too?

10:39.339 --> 10:42.140
Look, there's two things
i know, quaid.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.709
Number one: I trust taka
with my life.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.145
And number two: I know that
if I ask too many questions

10:47.147 --> 10:48.713
he could end my life
like that.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.315
( Snaps fingers )

10:52.953 --> 10:54.786
You got this?

11:03.630 --> 11:04.963
Piece.

11:04.965 --> 11:08.466
Of...

11:08.468 --> 11:10.035
Cake.

11:10.037 --> 11:10.869
Wait.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.303
Wait, wait, wait.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.909
Send a scout first.

11:17.911 --> 11:21.312
They only guard the front,
not inside.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.681
No, something's wrong.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.382
This was your plan
in the first place.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.418
I'm going.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.436
Sweet.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.587
Wait.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.792
Show me your face.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.734
Quaid?

12:49.736 --> 12:51.636
Show me your damn face.

12:56.710 --> 12:59.344
( Hissing )

12:59.346 --> 13:01.179
( Gun shots )

13:03.250 --> 13:05.750
( Snarling )

13:05.752 --> 13:14.759
( Gun shots )

13:14.761 --> 13:15.293
It's a trap!

13:15.295 --> 13:16.427
Fall back!

13:16.429 --> 13:22.333
( Gun shots )

13:44.491 --> 13:46.825
( Low growling )

13:50.263 --> 13:52.197
We failed.

13:54.634 --> 13:59.470
( Stuttering ) The
sewer beasts got them.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.841
The woman must be dead.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.243
She must be.

14:05.245 --> 14:09.113
( Low growling )

14:16.056 --> 14:21.659
( Starts sobbing )

14:24.064 --> 14:26.831
How can you be sure?

14:26.833 --> 14:29.868
Hmm?

14:29.870 --> 14:35.907
How can you be sure?

14:35.909 --> 14:39.110
( Stammering ) She-
she must be...

14:39.112 --> 14:44.349
( Growling )

14:44.351 --> 14:48.519
( Bellows in frustration )

14:53.526 --> 14:56.928
( Continues to bellows )

15:05.805 --> 15:07.105
Callie, could you grab me

15:07.107 --> 15:08.973
another bowl of soup please
while you're up?

15:08.975 --> 15:11.109
Sure.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.610
Thank you.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.948
She's gonna be ok.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.616
Yeah.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.085
I'm just gonna...

15:21.087 --> 15:23.588
I think I need some time
to myself.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.757
You feel alright?

15:25.759 --> 15:28.159
Yeah, fine.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.162
I wanna tell you something.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.463
Something I've never
told you,

15:32.465 --> 15:34.666
or anybody else for that matter.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.467
I've got a kid.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.202
I do.

15:38.204 --> 15:40.438
What?

15:40.440 --> 15:45.843
I try not to think about it,
but... uh,

15:45.845 --> 15:47.412
it was when I first,

15:47.414 --> 15:50.682
I was young and my dad wanted me
to get rid of her but...

15:50.684 --> 15:54.018
So i- I was... so
i left and ran off.

15:54.020 --> 15:58.389
I had this thing but I didn't
really know how to...

15:58.391 --> 16:02.760
So um, anyhow I just- just
so you know, um...

16:02.762 --> 16:06.230
I get how you feel
because...

16:06.232 --> 16:09.767
Not a day goes by where I don't
think about my baby.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.642
Thank you.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.749
This is it.

16:34.861 --> 16:39.163
The only way this is gonna work
is if one of us- gah!

16:39.165 --> 16:40.031
Son of a-

16:40.033 --> 16:40.765
oh my god.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.900
Hey!

16:42.902 --> 16:44.936
How does that feel,
you piece of shit?

16:44.938 --> 16:45.937
Dammit!

16:45.939 --> 16:47.071
You like my booby-trap?

16:47.073 --> 16:48.072
Huh? Do you?

16:48.074 --> 16:48.706
Hey!

16:48.708 --> 16:50.241
Do you like how it feels?

16:50.243 --> 16:51.042
Do you like how that feels?!

16:51.044 --> 16:51.776
Do you like it?!

16:51.778 --> 16:52.510
Brendan!

16:52.512 --> 16:53.811
Do you like that?!

16:53.813 --> 16:55.380
Do you want some?!!!!

16:55.382 --> 16:56.547
Somebody help us!

16:56.549 --> 16:57.582
Do you like how that feels?!!

16:57.584 --> 16:59.484
Do you?!!

16:59.486 --> 17:00.752
Aaargh!!!

17:00.754 --> 17:02.320
I'm not done with you!

17:02.322 --> 17:03.688
I'm going to destroy you!!!!

17:03.690 --> 17:05.423
Somebody help us!

17:05.425 --> 17:06.524
Enough! Stop!

17:06.526 --> 17:07.558
Now!

17:07.560 --> 17:08.559
( Screams )

17:11.998 --> 17:13.731
I'm gonna kill you.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.533
I'm gonna kill you!

17:15.535 --> 17:16.300
Stop!

17:16.302 --> 17:17.201
You're dead!

17:17.203 --> 17:18.369
Stop! Stop!!

17:18.371 --> 17:19.670
I understand how you feel,
i do.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.539
But this is not how
we do things.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.208
Go cool off, now!

17:24.210 --> 17:25.910
Now.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.114
Is that how you control
your people?

17:30.116 --> 17:32.150
I'm sorry, this is not
the way we operate.

17:32.152 --> 17:35.219
Oh yeah, except for my
little hallway beating.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.387
This won't happen again.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.055
Oh, good.

17:37.057 --> 17:37.789
I feel so much better.

17:37.791 --> 17:38.689
I promise you.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.490
I know it's not gonna
happen again

17:39.492 --> 17:40.525
because if any of your people

17:40.527 --> 17:43.327
come at me like that again
I'm gonna kill 'em.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.596
You might wanna go
tell them that.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.471
Here, let me take
a look at that.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.249
You eavesdropping
with that thing?

18:07.620 --> 18:09.787
Is that what that is?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.757
You always carry that around?

18:19.566 --> 18:22.834
Hey.

18:22.836 --> 18:24.469
<i> What're they saying?</i>

18:24.471 --> 18:26.404
( Whispering )

18:26.406 --> 18:29.774
<i> Come on.</i>

18:29.776 --> 18:31.976
<i> Come on.</i>

18:40.153 --> 18:42.520
They're going to execute us.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.291
All of us.

19:11.251 --> 19:11.816
Come on.

19:11.818 --> 19:12.750
Almost there.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.652
Oh god, that thing
down there that bit me

19:14.654 --> 19:15.653
something's not right.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.654
Shit.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.656
It's ok, there's a doctor
in there.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.492
We just gotta get back in.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.427
The door code is 1936.

19:23.429 --> 19:24.362
1936.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.030
I hope.

19:26.032 --> 19:26.998
( Growling )

19:27.000 --> 19:27.765
Shit.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.300
We gotta go.

19:34.507 --> 19:38.342
( Ferals growling )

19:42.782 --> 19:44.015
( Growling )

20:07.607 --> 20:09.807
Damn, it's really starting
to hurt.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.710
You said you normally heal
faster than this.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.180
Yeah, I don't know, since I woke
up I have been able to.

20:16.182 --> 20:19.083
That thing down there
was different.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.686
This bite is getting worse.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.388
What about this doctor
and the others?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.524
Are you sure you can
trust these people?

20:26.526 --> 20:27.758
I hope so.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.627
At least for now.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.262
Holy shit, you made
it back!

20:31.264 --> 20:32.530
Yeah, just.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.065
How?

20:34.067 --> 20:34.799
And who's this?

20:34.801 --> 20:35.466
It doesn't matter.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.167
I'm her friend.

20:36.169 --> 20:37.235
Where's doc?

20:37.237 --> 20:38.869
She needs a doctor, now.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.573
Go get the doctor.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.708
I'll take these two
to the cafeteria.

20:43.710 --> 20:44.242
Go.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.042
The cafeteria, why?

20:45.044 --> 20:45.710
It's closer.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.144
Come on.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.478
Doc, we need you.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.780
Now, please.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.749
What're you guys trying
to pull?

21:46.973 --> 21:48.306
They banished mohamad?

21:48.308 --> 21:49.507
Why?

21:49.509 --> 21:52.576
Then they stabbed Axel and
now they want to get rid of us.

21:52.578 --> 21:53.577
What?

21:53.579 --> 21:54.679
Sam read their lips.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.480
They're gonna execute us.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.153
Hey, how're you doing?

22:02.155 --> 22:04.755
Hey.

22:04.757 --> 22:09.527
I sacrificed myself for you
and this is how you repay me?

22:09.529 --> 22:12.330
You- you lock my people up,
you attack them?

22:12.332 --> 22:14.965
It's just temporary,
believe me.

22:14.967 --> 22:18.202
Just until we know that
we exiled the right one.

22:18.204 --> 22:22.373
Look, one of them
is a murderer.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.809
It's a fact.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.744
Mohamad took the blame
so we sent him away.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.512
Bullshit.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.380
That kid would never-

22:29.382 --> 22:32.383
look, it doesn't matter.
Someone did it.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.485
We're trying to
figure out who.

22:43.496 --> 22:46.063
Fine.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.132
I'll stay out of it.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.501
I'll be friggin Switzerland
as far as your concerned.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.336
Ok?

22:52.338 --> 22:54.638
Just leave Susan alone.

22:54.640 --> 22:57.575
I'll be on my way
when I'm better.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.210
Understood.

22:59.212 --> 23:03.781
Obviously you'll be free to go
when you've recovered, so...

23:14.193 --> 23:17.194
You're gonna leave us?

23:17.196 --> 23:18.996
What do you think?

23:18.998 --> 23:23.200
I think I can count on you.

23:23.202 --> 23:27.338
Good.

23:27.340 --> 23:29.774
Fill me in.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.976
We're doing our best.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.577
There's a grate
in the ceiling.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.447
We're trying to get
one of us through it.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.783
Good.

23:38.785 --> 23:41.552
That's good.

23:41.554 --> 23:46.390
You do that.

23:46.392 --> 23:49.093
I got a message for Axel.

23:50.696 --> 23:53.063
Susan, you can help
with this, too.

23:55.301 --> 23:59.236
( Whispering )

24:01.207 --> 24:02.873
What do we do now?

24:02.875 --> 24:06.343
We can't keep them
locked up here forever.

24:06.345 --> 24:07.978
You're right.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.880
Axel's the problem.

24:09.882 --> 24:13.584
We separate him, maybe
we can get to the truth.

24:25.364 --> 24:26.730
Shit.

24:26.732 --> 24:28.299
How dare you?!

24:28.301 --> 24:29.967
Who are you to talk to me
that way?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.168
Huh?

24:31.170 --> 24:32.436
Back off!!

24:32.438 --> 24:33.537
I said back off!

24:33.539 --> 24:34.271
You bitch!

24:34.273 --> 24:34.972
You bitch!

24:34.974 --> 24:36.440
You're just like these assholes!

24:36.442 --> 24:39.310
Put that thing down or I will
stab you in the throat, bitch!

24:39.312 --> 24:40.077
I'll kill you!

24:40.079 --> 24:41.078
I'll kill you!

24:41.080 --> 24:41.745
I'll kill you!

24:41.747 --> 24:43.647
I'll kill you!

24:43.649 --> 24:45.115
( Screaming )

24:45.117 --> 24:47.151
Escort the doctor back
to the others!

24:47.153 --> 24:49.787
Hey, you stay here
with Vanessa.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.556
Uh, she said "Switzerland".

24:52.558 --> 24:54.124
Remember?

24:54.126 --> 24:57.628
So give us some space.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.463
Oh, and we're both gonna
need some new clothes.

24:59.465 --> 25:00.531
You got that?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.661
What happened?

25:30.663 --> 25:32.329
Vanessa's back.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.163
She made it somehow, but-

25:33.165 --> 25:33.931
she's alive?

25:33.933 --> 25:35.366
Yes, but very injured.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.200
Now, listen.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.201
She has a plan.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.904
She says you need to try
and get out.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.940
If you can catch Brendan
off-guard then somehow secure

25:42.942 --> 25:45.709
the doors on both ends of
the wing they can take out

25:45.711 --> 25:47.378
whoever is left
on the other side.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.379
Who are "they"?

25:48.381 --> 25:50.714
She- she brought in some
woman, some Susan chick.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.317
Anyway, she said "take out
the generator".

25:53.319 --> 25:55.252
She wants me to get them
in the dark.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.388
Get them disoriented,
get the advantage.

25:57.390 --> 25:58.155
I'm in.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.691
I'll do the lights.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.692
You?

26:01.694 --> 26:03.494
It's better than facing
a firing squad at dawn.

26:03.496 --> 26:04.261
Why not me?

26:04.263 --> 26:04.929
You can't do both.

26:04.931 --> 26:05.629
Yeah, I can.

26:05.631 --> 26:07.731
Not at the same time.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.067
You need to trust someone,
Axel.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.835
Let one of us help you.

26:18.744 --> 26:19.577
Fine.

26:19.579 --> 26:20.277
What else?

26:20.279 --> 26:21.345
She said...

26:21.347 --> 26:24.114
Um, she said something
about building a rat trap?

26:24.116 --> 26:25.416
What does that mean?

26:25.418 --> 26:28.385
Meaning get them all jammed
down one end of this joint,

26:28.387 --> 26:30.654
treat them like a bunch of
goddamn vermin and then...

26:32.725 --> 26:34.124
What?

26:34.126 --> 26:34.959
Gee whiz, I don't know,
John.

26:34.961 --> 26:35.859
What do you think?

26:35.861 --> 26:38.462
I think we're all gonna die.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.731
That's what I think.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.193
Hey, you.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.795
Hey there.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.597
Look what I found.

27:13.599 --> 27:17.034
Oh, sweet.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.569
Do you remember me?

27:18.571 --> 27:19.503
Of course.

27:19.505 --> 27:20.704
Vanessa.

27:20.706 --> 27:22.873
Hi.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.842
They told me you got back.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.210
That's good.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.345
Yeah.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.913
Are you ok?

27:29.915 --> 27:31.782
I heard about what happened
to you.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.684
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:33.686 --> 27:36.320
I still like it here.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.888
Good.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.089
That's good.

27:42.561 --> 27:44.828
Hey, you wanna have fun?

27:44.830 --> 27:45.963
You wanna play a game?

27:45.965 --> 27:46.997
Sure.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.899
Ok, but you can't
tell anybody,

27:48.901 --> 27:50.067
'cause that'll ruin it, alright?

27:50.069 --> 27:53.537
It's gotta be just
between me and you.

27:53.539 --> 27:55.639
What're we gonna play?

27:55.641 --> 27:57.374
Hide and seek.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.308
That's fun!

27:58.310 --> 28:00.878
Yep, and you can hide anywhere
you want.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.480
But if you come out
before I find you,

28:03.482 --> 28:07.451
or before I yell "i give up",
then you lose.

28:07.453 --> 28:08.719
Ok?

28:19.031 --> 28:19.963
We're about to have dinner.

28:19.965 --> 28:21.632
Should I save you
a couple plates?

28:21.634 --> 28:23.867
No thanks, we'll make
our own.

28:27.406 --> 28:30.107
For protection, without
touching your borders.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.757
You want some help, babe?

28:48.561 --> 28:49.393
( Groans )

28:49.395 --> 28:50.494
Don't call me babe.

28:50.496 --> 28:54.298
( Dishes clatter )

29:35.674 --> 29:36.874
Hold it right there.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.142
I just need to talk
to Brendan.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.309
That ain't happening.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.677
( Alarm sounds )

29:40.679 --> 29:42.279
( Gun fire )

29:42.281 --> 29:44.648
( Groans )

29:45.451 --> 29:46.116
He's in here!

29:46.118 --> 29:46.784
He's in here!

29:46.786 --> 29:47.684
( Groans )

29:47.686 --> 29:48.352
Oh, shit!

29:48.354 --> 29:49.319
Shit!

29:49.321 --> 29:50.821
( Gun fire )

29:50.823 --> 29:53.490
( Screaming )

29:53.492 --> 29:56.693
( Fighting grunts )

29:56.695 --> 30:01.198
( Screaming )

30:01.200 --> 30:08.839
( Fighting grunts )

30:08.841 --> 30:12.943
( Screaming )

30:12.945 --> 30:16.079
( Fighting grunts )

30:16.081 --> 30:18.782
( Groans )

30:18.784 --> 30:25.255
( Alarm continues to wail )

30:25.257 --> 30:31.161
( Gunfire )

30:34.300 --> 30:35.833
What have you done, huh?

30:35.835 --> 30:37.167
What the hell have you done?!

30:39.338 --> 30:40.871
Christ!

30:41.640 --> 30:43.440
I'm gonna need those keys.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.741
It didn't have to be like this,
man.

30:44.743 --> 30:45.809
Not like this!

30:45.811 --> 30:47.311
No, it didn't.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.445
And?

30:48.447 --> 30:49.379
And?!

30:49.381 --> 30:52.015
And like I said, I'm gonna
need those keys.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.750
God damn you.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.452
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.888
Yeah, you probably should have.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.893
( Alarm continues to wail )

31:11.904 --> 31:12.769
Let's talk about this, man.

31:12.771 --> 31:13.904
Come on.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.105
Oh, we're about to talk.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.707
You comin', new girl, or what?

31:16.709 --> 31:18.408
It's Susan.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.611
No, not with him.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.446
Why's that?

31:22.448 --> 31:23.413
He's one of them.

31:23.415 --> 31:24.414
No, not anymore.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.916
Vanessa turned me
just like she turned you.

31:25.918 --> 31:27.251
No, this guy?

31:27.253 --> 31:29.019
He's...

31:29.021 --> 31:30.087
He's one of us now.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.122
You might not like it but
that's the way it is.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.405
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.439
Yes, definitely.

31:49.441 --> 31:53.644
We can't just...
What're you saying?

31:53.646 --> 31:54.611
The obvious.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.280
Jesus.

31:56.282 --> 31:59.116
We might as well be them.

31:59.118 --> 32:02.085
He's not saying kill the
rest of them, are you?

32:02.087 --> 32:03.020
( Sighs )

32:03.022 --> 32:05.956
No, look- I just-
we can't stay like this.

32:05.958 --> 32:10.160
In here, us and them.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.062
Ok.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.430
Then what's the answer?

32:13.432 --> 32:14.731
I don't know the answer,
i just-

32:14.733 --> 32:15.966
I did what I had to do.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.068
You didn't have to,
you chose to.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.469
You just slaughtered their
whole group.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.605
Yeah, all those people.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.106
For you.

32:23.108 --> 32:23.674
And you.

32:23.676 --> 32:24.708
And you.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.510
All of you, so all of you
didn't have to die.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.312
Yeah, but...

32:28.314 --> 32:29.680
That's the way
the world is now.

32:29.682 --> 32:31.648
Yeah, says you.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.050
I'm sorry, was it a bad idea?

32:33.052 --> 32:34.351
Obviously not.

32:34.353 --> 32:38.956
I'm... I'm just saying...

32:38.958 --> 32:41.024
What?

32:41.026 --> 32:42.960
These were people.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.661
We killed people.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.196
Actual people.

32:46.198 --> 32:49.099
Actually, I killed those people.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.767
That was me.

32:50.769 --> 32:54.972
You didn't do shit.

32:54.974 --> 32:59.009
So what's the answer then?

32:59.011 --> 33:00.944
We know the answer.

33:00.946 --> 33:03.647
Is this how you
handle everything?

33:03.649 --> 33:06.483
You're throwing them
to the wolves.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.151
You just love to be the good guy
when you're sitting over there

33:08.153 --> 33:10.320
with no dirt on your hands.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.389
So that's it then?

33:15.527 --> 33:17.194
We all agree?

33:19.198 --> 33:20.197
Like it or not.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.531
Yep.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.869
Yeah.

33:25.871 --> 33:26.370
Ok then.

33:26.372 --> 33:29.473
End of discussion.

33:29.475 --> 33:33.443
What about the little girl?

33:33.445 --> 33:34.544
Callie.

33:34.546 --> 33:35.846
Callie!

33:35.848 --> 33:37.681
Callie!

33:39.385 --> 33:40.751
Callie?

33:40.753 --> 33:41.651
Callie?

33:41.653 --> 33:43.186
Callie!

33:58.170 --> 34:00.570
I heard shots.

34:00.572 --> 34:01.571
Callie.

34:01.573 --> 34:05.108
I was hiding for so long.

34:05.110 --> 34:06.410
I'm sorry.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.378
It's okay.

34:13.519 --> 34:17.354
Callie, listen--

34:17.356 --> 34:19.089
do you give up yet?

34:23.762 --> 34:26.096
Yeah, sweetie.

34:26.098 --> 34:28.398
I give up.

34:28.400 --> 34:35.439
( Sobbing )

34:36.942 --> 34:42.212
Quaid. The others.

34:42.214 --> 34:45.415
All dead.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.584
You're a traitor.

34:47.586 --> 34:51.221
( Sobbing ) I swear to you,
i didn't know.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.222
I didn't know.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.958
They wanted you to have
those building plans.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.794
Walked us right into a trap.

34:57.796 --> 34:58.929
It had to be you.

34:58.931 --> 35:01.331
( Sobbing )

35:08.073 --> 35:09.739
Who did you
betray us to?

35:12.945 --> 35:14.211
<i> Hmm?</i>

35:15.747 --> 35:18.081
You tell me or so help me
god I'll-

35:18.083 --> 35:19.382
( gasps )

35:19.384 --> 35:24.154
( Choking )

35:24.156 --> 35:26.990
Your god won't
help you now.

35:26.992 --> 35:29.659
Where is taka?

35:29.661 --> 35:33.163
Tell me where to find him.

35:33.165 --> 35:36.333
I don't know who
you're talking about.

35:36.335 --> 35:40.203
Taka.

35:40.205 --> 35:42.539
I'm sorry.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.908
I can't help you.

35:44.910 --> 35:45.842
( Groans in pain )

35:45.844 --> 35:48.445
No?

35:48.447 --> 35:50.881
No.

35:50.883 --> 35:57.721
And even if I could,
i wouldn't.

35:57.723 --> 36:01.358
But you already have.

36:01.360 --> 36:07.063
I wasn't sure taka even existed
until now, thanks to you.

36:07.065 --> 36:11.434
Someday he's gonna come
for you.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.216
I told you.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.623
I know your scent.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.730
Now you'll lead me
to the others.

37:09.194 --> 37:11.962
Please don't do this.

37:11.964 --> 37:16.333
I'm begging you here.

37:16.335 --> 37:19.769
Look, send me then.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.538
Send me but leave the rest
of them, please.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.940
Look, you can't do this.

37:23.942 --> 37:24.674
You just can't.

37:24.676 --> 37:25.742
You're killing us.

37:25.744 --> 37:26.776
You realize that, right?

37:26.778 --> 37:28.895
You're basically sending us
out there to die.

37:28.896 --> 37:31.013
You mean exactly what you
were about to do to us?

37:31.016 --> 37:33.049
And what you already did
to mohamad.

37:33.051 --> 37:36.386
This is- he was a murderer.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.420
Liar!

37:37.422 --> 37:39.456
We never said we
were gonna kill you!

37:39.458 --> 37:40.590
Liar.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.025
We didn't.

37:45.297 --> 37:48.231
Someone here is killing people.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.833
And it wasn't any of us.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.067
It's one of you.

37:55.907 --> 38:00.910
Don't you hear what
he's saying?

38:00.912 --> 38:01.711
Grab your stuff.

38:01.713 --> 38:02.779
Let's go.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.447
Don't have more blood
on your hands.

38:04.449 --> 38:05.415
Come on!

38:05.417 --> 38:06.883
I can't go back out there.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.018
I can't.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.887
Just give us another chance.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.589
Let's move.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.766
Can they please stay,
Vanessa?

38:22.768 --> 38:25.235
If they act really nice
this time, please?

38:25.237 --> 38:27.504
Callie.

38:27.506 --> 38:30.440
I'm sorry, sweetie, no.

38:30.442 --> 38:34.644
I know it's hard to understand
but they just can't.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.913
I'm sorry.

38:38.050 --> 38:40.350
( Starts crying )

38:40.352 --> 38:43.853
It's ok.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.722
Shh, it's ok.

38:47.893 --> 38:50.060
Noon's your best shot.

38:50.062 --> 38:52.662
Now, get outside the city,
you might have a chance.

39:03.375 --> 39:08.645
Someday when the monsters
are gone and the sun is shining,

39:08.647 --> 39:11.414
we'll go on a new adventure.

39:15.554 --> 39:16.086
No, Callie!

39:16.088 --> 39:16.786
Callie!

39:16.788 --> 39:18.321
No, ca- Callie!

39:18.323 --> 39:22.425
Cal- Callie...

39:22.427 --> 39:27.197
( Sobbing )

39:27.199 --> 39:30.233
Oh, please.

39:45.484 --> 39:46.883
Ok, go now.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.255
Go now.

40:01.666 --> 40:02.966
No, no, Callie!

40:02.968 --> 40:05.268
Callie!

40:05.270 --> 40:07.270
<i> You changed the code?</i>

40:07.272 --> 40:08.004
<i> What's the code?</i>

40:08.006 --> 40:09.939
What's the friggin' code?!

40:09.941 --> 40:12.876
You can't open it again.

40:12.878 --> 40:13.543
<i> It's too dangerous.</i>

40:13.545 --> 40:15.178
<i> I'm not doing it.</i>

40:15.180 --> 40:17.514
<i> Besides, she's</i>
<i> with her people.</i>

40:17.516 --> 40:19.749
<i> She's where she wants to be.</i>

40:19.751 --> 40:24.654
She's just a little girl.

40:24.656 --> 40:29.759
( Continues to sob )

40:32.297 --> 40:34.097
I'm worried about this wound.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.365
Why?

40:35.367 --> 40:37.667
It's not healing over and
you seem to be getting worse,

40:37.669 --> 40:38.902
not better.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.703
It doesn't matter.

40:43.408 --> 40:45.074
Vanessa, listen.

40:45.076 --> 40:48.511
We tried to stop the little girl
but... she got out-

40:48.513 --> 40:51.414
I don't want to talk about it,
doc.

40:53.685 --> 40:54.984
She seemed to really care
about you.

40:54.986 --> 40:57.020
Drop it.

41:06.198 --> 41:09.566
Do you think it would have been
better if we just killed them?

41:09.568 --> 41:13.002
Right here in the hospital?

41:13.004 --> 41:15.872
What do you think?

41:15.874 --> 41:19.242
I don't know.

41:19.244 --> 41:23.613
Who knows what's right and wrong
in this new world?

41:23.615 --> 41:25.482
Exactly.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.951
Nothing matters anymore.

41:27.953 --> 41:31.888
<i> ♪ Sleep, sleep easy... ♪</i>

41:31.890 --> 41:36.960
