Unsolved homicide

to worry about that

04:22.400 --> 04:24.901
You know, some people,

04:24.936 --> 04:25.902
they relax.

04:25.937 --> 04:27.037
They're off the clock.

04:27.071 --> 04:29.439
My clock has its own schedule.

04:29.474 --> 04:31.875
And you are a fry thief.

04:31.909 --> 04:32.876
WAITRESS:
A little warm-up, sheriff?

04:32.910 --> 04:34.678
Oh, thanks so much.

04:35.112 --> 04:37.079
You doing okay, Abbie?

04:37.348 --> 04:39.015
I'm real good, Maddie,
thank you.

04:39.050 --> 04:42.018
Don't you find it odd,
all the unsolved cases

04:42.053 --> 04:43.253
around here?

04:43.287 --> 04:44.855
I mean, you, of all people...

04:44.889 --> 04:46.189
Stop.

04:46.224 --> 04:47.390
I know what you're doing.

04:47.425 --> 04:50.861
You are drinking
too much coffee.

04:50.895 --> 04:52.596
You've been strange
enough as it is.

04:52.630 --> 04:54.764
I'm just saying, aren't you
gonna miss all the excitement?

04:54.799 --> 04:56.933

05:00.705 --> 05:02.873
I'm not asking
if you're qualified.

05:02.907 --> 05:04.975
I'm asking if
you're running away.

05:08.513 --> 05:10.080
Hey, your pie's soup, old man.

05:10.114 --> 05:11.715
Time's up.

05:11.749 --> 05:12.916
It's on me.

05:19.490 --> 05:20.657
Father.

05:20.991 --> 05:22.959
Sheriff.

DISPATCHER: (Over radio)
Charlie 101 to Com.

05:26.964 --> 05:28.732
Go ahead, Charlie 101.

05:28.766 --> 05:31.501
I got a call from
the Fox Creek Stables.

05:31.536 --> 05:32.769
Horses are spooked by something.

05:32.804 --> 05:34.438
Probably coyotes again.

05:34.472 --> 05:35.539
All right.

05:35.573 --> 05:37.340
(Laughing):
We will be right over.

05:39.177 --> 05:42.779
And this is why
I got into police work.

05:42.814 --> 05:44.281
But you're gonna miss this.

05:44.315 --> 05:45.615
(Laughing)
I tell you.

06:10.308 --> 06:13.310

06:13.344 --> 06:15.312
(Horses neighing)

06:15.346 --> 06:16.913

06:16.948 --> 06:19.676
You go on up to the house.
See if you can find Jimmy.

06:20.718 --> 06:22.252
Be careful.

06:22.286 --> 06:23.587
Yeah.

06:25.656 --> 06:27.657
(Thunder rumbles)

06:28.726 --> 06:30.694
(Horse neighs)

06:30.728 --> 06:32.396
Mr. Oglevie?

06:32.430 --> 06:35.132
It's Lieutenant Mills.

06:35.166 --> 06:37.467
(Neighing, thumping)

06:49.480 --> 06:51.415
(Thunder crashes)

06:51.449 --> 06:53.250
(Creaks)

06:53.284 --> 06:54.417
(Horse whinnies)

06:58.790 --> 07:01.425
Ooh. Shh, shh, shh,
easy there. Easy.

07:01.459 --> 07:02.693
Easy, easy.

07:02.727 --> 07:03.927
Easy. Easy.

07:12.203 --> 07:14.671
Easy. Easy.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.288
We got a weapon on the ground.

07:31.722 --> 07:33.857
Say again, Abbie?
You're breaking up.

07:33.891 --> 07:35.392
Something is wrong.

07:35.426 --> 07:37.561
We have a weapon
on the ground.

07:37.595 --> 07:39.396
(Metal clinking in distance)

07:39.430 --> 07:40.897
Stand by.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.201
(Thunder rumbles)

07:48.406 --> 07:49.873
Oh, my...

07:49.907 --> 07:52.643
Corbin, I found Oglevie.

07:52.677 --> 07:54.378
Someone cut off his head.

07:56.481 --> 07:58.882
This is the sheriff.
Step out where I can see you.

08:06.257 --> 08:07.924
My God.

08:12.997 --> 08:14.297
(Gunshots)

08:26.577 --> 08:27.544
(Screams)

08:27.578 --> 08:28.812
Oh!

08:32.717 --> 08:33.717
(Horse neighing)

08:42.760 --> 08:45.495
(Neighs)

08:48.933 --> 08:50.934
(Neighs)

08:58.910 --> 09:00.477
Corbin.
(Grunts)

09:01.512 --> 09:02.713
Officer down!

09:02.747 --> 09:04.414
Oh, my God.

09:04.449 --> 09:05.616
Officer down!

09:05.650 --> 09:06.984
Fox Creek Stables!

09:07.018 --> 09:08.518
(Sobs)

09:08.553 --> 09:12.089
Repeat, Fox Creek Stables,
officer down!

09:12.123 --> 09:14.124
(Siren wailing,
tires screeching)

09:18.363 --> 09:20.063
(Car horn honks)

09:22.300 --> 09:24.668
Turn around!
Put your hands on your head!

09:27.071 --> 09:29.039
I said turn around,
put your hands on your head!

09:32.410 --> 09:33.410
On your knees!

09:34.746 --> 09:36.313
(Handcuffs clicking)

09:52.263 --> 09:53.230
It isn't him.

09:53.264 --> 09:54.665
You sure?

09:56.034 --> 09:58.568
I know this isn't easy,
Abbie, but please...

09:58.603 --> 10:00.203
take a closer look.

10:00.238 --> 10:01.672
ABBIE:
Andy, I'm sure.

10:01.706 --> 10:03.573
The man I saw was
wearing some kind of

10:03.608 --> 10:05.175
old military uniform,
like, uh...

10:05.209 --> 10:06.877
red coat.

10:06.911 --> 10:09.913
He had something on his hand.

10:09.947 --> 10:11.882
I don't know, like a branding.

10:11.916 --> 10:14.017
Did he carry a broadax?

10:14.052 --> 10:15.452
What?

10:16.454 --> 10:18.989
The mark on his hand...

10:19.023 --> 10:20.657
was it a bow?

10:24.796 --> 10:26.196
How do you know that?

10:26.230 --> 10:28.231
Oh, no, no.

10:28.266 --> 10:29.833
No, no, it can't be.

10:29.867 --> 10:31.034
Hey.

10:31.069 --> 10:33.170
Who is he? When's the last time
you saw him?

10:34.772 --> 10:37.507
When I cut off his head.

10:38.910 --> 10:40.878
Who are you?

10:45.660 --> 10:47.394
CRANE:
Are you an elected Magistrate?

10:47.429 --> 10:49.196
Is this an admiralty court?

10:49.230 --> 10:51.064
What are you doing?

10:51.099 --> 10:53.600
This is a polygraph machine.

10:53.635 --> 10:54.802
I ask you questions,

10:54.836 --> 10:57.671
it knows if you're lying
or telling the truth.

10:57.705 --> 10:59.473
The machine knows?

10:59.507 --> 11:01.375
What the hell kind
of a place is this?

11:01.409 --> 11:03.749
By what right are you holding me
against my will?

11:03.784 --> 11:05.793
And what on earth is that?

11:05.828 --> 11:07.948
OFFICER: You're being held
as a murder suspect

11:07.982 --> 11:10.451
in the death
of sheriff August Corbin.

11:10.485 --> 11:12.586
I had nothing to do
with that man's death.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.721
- Weren't you listening?
- Sir...

11:14.756 --> 11:17.724
I can't force you to take
this test, but if you pass,

11:17.759 --> 11:20.327
you have a better chance
of walking out of here.

11:20.361 --> 11:22.396
- Proceed.
- Thank you.

11:22.430 --> 11:24.714
Tell me your name
and where you're from.

11:24.749 --> 11:27.101
My name is Ichabod Crane.

11:27.135 --> 11:29.736
I was a Professor of History
at Merton College,

11:29.771 --> 11:32.773
Oxford, when I was enlisted
in the Queen's Royal Regiment

11:32.807 --> 11:35.909
and sent to the American
colonies to fight the patriots.

11:35.944 --> 11:38.612
It didn't take long for me
to have a change of heart,

11:38.646 --> 11:39.913
and I defected.

11:39.948 --> 11:42.750
You're saying you're a spy.

11:42.784 --> 11:44.284
I'm saying the rule of tyranny

11:44.319 --> 11:45.853
betrayed the weight
of my conscience

11:45.887 --> 11:47.554
and I couldn't allow myself

11:47.589 --> 11:49.089
to give my life
for anything less.

11:49.124 --> 11:50.524
So, yes...

11:50.558 --> 11:51.859
I became a spy
under the command

11:51.893 --> 11:53.393
of General Washington.

11:53.428 --> 11:55.629
General George Washington?

11:55.663 --> 11:57.464
Do you know him?

11:58.666 --> 12:00.601
OFFICER:
Tell me about the... "Horseman."

12:00.635 --> 12:03.637
Would you admit to cutting
off his head... Yes or no?

12:03.672 --> 12:06.006
No.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.040
First I shot him.

12:07.075 --> 12:08.408
But he rose back up.

12:08.443 --> 12:10.644
Beheading him seemed
the next logical step.

12:11.346 --> 12:12.646
Then what happened?

12:12.680 --> 12:15.416
I was taken to triage.

12:15.450 --> 12:17.051
(Explosion nearby)
(Horse neighs)

12:17.085 --> 12:19.086
(Men grunting and groaning)

12:21.156 --> 12:22.389
No, no, no, no.

12:22.424 --> 12:23.724
No.

12:23.758 --> 12:25.392
CRANE:
Katrina was there.

12:25.427 --> 12:26.393
Katrina?

12:26.428 --> 12:28.262
My wife.

12:28.296 --> 12:30.798
She's a civilian nurse
in the 37th Regiment.

12:30.832 --> 12:32.866
I was dying.

12:32.901 --> 12:33.901
Ichabod, stay with me.

12:33.935 --> 12:35.836
Stay with me.

12:36.838 --> 12:38.906
I must have lost consciousness.

12:38.940 --> 12:41.775
Next thing I knew,
I woke up in a cave.

12:43.845 --> 12:45.813
So you have no memory
of what happened

12:45.847 --> 12:48.649
between now and then,
no rational explanation

12:48.683 --> 12:50.651
as to why you believe there's

12:50.685 --> 12:53.454
a headless horseman
running around Sleepy Hollow.

12:53.488 --> 12:55.189
How did you end up here?

12:55.223 --> 12:57.591
CRANE: I could tell you if I
knew where the hell "here" is.

12:57.626 --> 13:00.094
Now, I have questions,
several thousand questions,

13:00.128 --> 13:02.129
but I'll spare you
the indignity of strapping you

13:02.163 --> 13:03.497
to a damn chair.

13:03.531 --> 13:05.766
Now, where am I?!

13:05.800 --> 13:07.534
The question isn't where...

13:07.569 --> 13:08.869
but when.

13:08.903 --> 13:10.371
The good news is
you won the war.

13:10.405 --> 13:13.007
The bad news is...

13:13.041 --> 13:16.276
It was 250 years ago.

13:18.948 --> 13:21.715
Welcome to the 21st century,
Mr. Crane.

13:27.555 --> 13:30.224
OFFICER:
Not one spike.

13:30.258 --> 13:32.226
He might be setting the table
for an insanity defense.

13:32.260 --> 13:33.894
MAN:
Take him to St. Gregory's.

13:33.928 --> 13:35.796
- I want a 72-hour psych eval.
- Okay.

13:35.830 --> 13:37.564
I'll take that now.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.167
OFFICER: We're transporting
to St. Gregory's, two vehicles.

13:40.201 --> 13:41.902
(Door opens)

13:41.937 --> 13:44.038
Sir?

13:44.072 --> 13:45.606
Captain?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.074
I'm Lieutenant Abbie Mills.

13:47.108 --> 13:49.109
I was sheriff Corbin's partner.

13:49.144 --> 13:50.511
Yes, of course.

13:50.545 --> 13:52.112
I'm very sorry for your loss.

13:52.147 --> 13:53.814
Thank you, sir,
but if I could ask...

13:53.848 --> 13:56.150
before you send him
to the psych unit,

13:56.184 --> 13:58.319
may I have a chance
to interrogate him myself?

13:58.353 --> 14:00.087
- Absolutely not.
- He described

14:00.121 --> 14:02.089
the appearance of the man
that I saw in perfect detail.

14:02.123 --> 14:03.624
He described a man with no head.

14:03.658 --> 14:05.092
Would you like to corroborate
that, Lieutenant?

14:06.761 --> 14:08.696
No, sir.

14:08.730 --> 14:10.597
But in putting the pieces

14:10.632 --> 14:12.666
of what I remember
back together,

14:12.701 --> 14:14.468
a detail sticks out.

14:14.502 --> 14:15.769
And what is that?

14:15.804 --> 14:19.006
There was very little blood
in August's neck wound.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.075
I checked with the coroner's
office, and they confirmed

14:21.109 --> 14:22.409
that the wound was cauterized,

14:22.444 --> 14:25.446
which means that the blade
was heated to 500 degrees.

14:25.480 --> 14:26.580
Why would that be?

14:26.614 --> 14:28.148
Arson didn't find
a single trace

14:28.183 --> 14:29.516
of fire near the area.

14:29.551 --> 14:30.951
Mr. Crane obviously
saw something

14:30.986 --> 14:32.786
that may help us understand
what we're missing.

14:32.821 --> 14:33.988
Or he could be the killer.

14:34.022 --> 14:35.456
We both know polygraphs
are trickable.

14:35.490 --> 14:37.591
- Sir, I understand...
- Lieutenant Mills, I'm sorry,

14:37.626 --> 14:39.293
but the answer is no.

14:39.327 --> 14:41.528
Go home, get some sleep.

14:42.731 --> 14:44.532
May I at least be the
one to transport him?

14:44.566 --> 14:45.866
My questions will be limited

14:45.901 --> 14:47.401
to the 20 minutes it
takes to get there.

14:47.435 --> 14:50.170
Maybe it'll help me
get some closure.

14:50.205 --> 14:51.772
Please?

14:53.041 --> 14:55.976
(Door opens)

14:57.612 --> 14:59.113
ABBIE:
Mr. Crane?

14:59.147 --> 15:01.315
I'm Lieutenant Abbie Mills.

15:01.349 --> 15:02.383
(Laughs)

15:02.417 --> 15:04.718
A female Lieutenant?
(Chuckles)

15:04.753 --> 15:05.819
In whose army?

15:05.854 --> 15:08.289
You're not gonna
break character, huh?

15:08.323 --> 15:10.624
You've... been emancipated,
I take it?

15:10.659 --> 15:12.293
Excuse me?

15:12.327 --> 15:13.727
From enslavement.

15:14.963 --> 15:17.731
Okay, I'll play along here.

15:17.766 --> 15:20.601
I am a black female lieutenant

15:20.635 --> 15:22.503
for the Westchester County
Police Department.

15:22.537 --> 15:24.138
Do you see this gun?

15:24.172 --> 15:25.940
I'm authorized to use it.

15:25.974 --> 15:27.408
On you.

15:27.442 --> 15:30.277
If you're insinuating
I endorse slavery,

15:30.312 --> 15:31.512
I'm offended.

15:31.546 --> 15:33.180
Wait, back up. You're offended?

15:33.214 --> 15:34.915
I'll have you know
I was a proponent

15:34.950 --> 15:37.017
of the Abolitionist Act
before the New York Assembly.

15:37.052 --> 15:38.986
Congratulations.

15:39.020 --> 15:40.654
Slavery has been
abolished 150 years.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.523
It's a whole new day in America.

15:42.557 --> 15:44.225
Oh.

15:44.259 --> 15:45.960
Well, I'm pleased to hear it.

15:45.994 --> 15:48.896
I, on the other hand,
remain shackled here.

15:48.930 --> 15:50.364
How do I remove
these damn manacles?

15:50.398 --> 15:51.632
You don't.

15:51.666 --> 15:53.300
I do.

15:53.335 --> 15:55.236
(Cell door opens)

15:55.270 --> 15:57.738
You want my help.

15:57.772 --> 16:01.675
Which suggests
you have no options.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.145
I'm not gonna say
that I believe you.

16:04.179 --> 16:07.915
But I am the closest thing to it
that you're gonna come across.

16:07.949 --> 16:08.916
Well, I can't say

16:08.950 --> 16:11.018
I believe you, either,
Ms. Mills.

16:11.052 --> 16:12.253
I haven't told you anything.

16:12.287 --> 16:13.520
No, you've told me everything.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.589
Everything you aren't
telling your colleagues.

16:15.624 --> 16:17.057
And what exactly would that be?

16:17.092 --> 16:19.226
That the killer you saw
was a headless horseman.

16:19.261 --> 16:21.262
It can't be mere coincidence

16:21.296 --> 16:23.531
that he and I arrive in this place
at exactly the same time.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.065
That isn't possible.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.800
Oh, really? Oh, well,
that's wonderful news.

16:26.835 --> 16:28.269
Thank you for
the clarification.

16:28.303 --> 16:30.037
Here I thought I'd actually
awoken in the future.

16:30.071 --> 16:33.374
And that my wife
had been dead for 250 years.

16:33.408 --> 16:35.843
I'm glad that everything
I'm seeing and hearing

16:35.877 --> 16:37.711
and touching is impossible.

16:37.746 --> 16:41.182
Because that means
it isn't actually happening.

16:41.216 --> 16:43.584
I have orders to take you
to a mental institution.

16:43.618 --> 16:45.519
Excellent.

16:45.554 --> 16:47.455
This day continues
to bear gifts.

16:47.489 --> 16:50.624
Will we be sharing
a cell, Lieutenant?

16:50.659 --> 16:53.127
Get in the damn car
or I will shoot you.

17:01.670 --> 17:03.304
Right.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.608
(Window squeaking)

17:14.950 --> 17:17.318
(Lock clicks)

17:17.352 --> 17:19.420
It's very annoying.

17:22.858 --> 17:25.159
That building used to be
a livery stables.

17:25.193 --> 17:27.962
Yeah?
Well, now it's a Starbucks.

17:27.996 --> 17:30.898
Where they make coffee.

17:32.034 --> 17:34.702
That building
is also a Starbucks.

17:34.736 --> 17:35.703
Yep.

17:35.737 --> 17:38.005
How many are there?

17:38.039 --> 17:40.107
Per block?

17:40.142 --> 17:41.842
Is there a law?

17:44.379 --> 17:46.914
250 years, huh?

17:46.948 --> 17:48.349
The Civil War didn't wake you?

17:48.383 --> 17:50.618
Noisy neighbors to the South?

17:50.652 --> 17:52.153
Did you get up to pee?

17:52.187 --> 17:54.121
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting up to pee

17:54.156 --> 17:55.589
every 75, 80 years...

17:55.624 --> 17:56.857
Have you quite finished?

17:56.892 --> 17:58.192
Because most of what you say

17:58.226 --> 18:00.928
is unintelligible gibberish
to me.

18:00.962 --> 18:02.763
It's like watching
a chicken cluck.

18:02.798 --> 18:04.131
And when did it
become acceptable

18:04.166 --> 18:06.100
for ladies to wear trousers?

18:06.134 --> 18:07.101
All right.

18:07.135 --> 18:09.203
You said you woke up in a cave.

18:09.237 --> 18:11.405
I want you to show me.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.740
You're violating orders.

18:12.774 --> 18:14.008
Convenient part for me is,

18:14.042 --> 18:16.177
if you tell anyone,
no one will believe you.

18:25.587 --> 18:27.822
We don't have much time.

18:57.586 --> 18:58.686
It's like a gun.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.721
Point, shoot.

19:04.359 --> 19:06.193
Entering from north.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.228
There...

19:07.262 --> 19:09.530
appear to be carvings
on the walls, a...

19:09.564 --> 19:10.765
pit filled with clay.

19:10.799 --> 19:12.833
Surrounding the pit...

19:12.868 --> 19:15.036
approximately 20 feet
from the entrance,

19:15.070 --> 19:18.639
there are what appear
to be jars filled with liquids.

19:18.674 --> 19:20.741
Six of them shattered.

19:31.553 --> 19:33.421
MAN:
We don't have much time.

19:34.456 --> 19:36.290
By God.

19:36.325 --> 19:37.725
What is it?

19:37.759 --> 19:39.694
A Bible.

19:39.728 --> 19:42.029
It was buried here with me.

19:42.064 --> 19:43.898
With this passage marked.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.633
The Book of Revelations.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.935
"And there before me
stood a white horse.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.706
"And its rider held a bow.

19:51.740 --> 19:54.675
"And his name was Death.

19:54.710 --> 19:57.912
"And then a voice
like thunder said,

19:57.946 --> 20:00.047
'Come and see.'"

20:00.082 --> 20:02.717
This tells of the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

20:04.252 --> 20:05.653
Come on.

20:07.222 --> 20:10.725
The Redcoats had just ambushed
us in the Hudson Valley.

20:12.594 --> 20:15.800
And in a desperate hour,
Washington called me to his tent.

20:16.732 --> 20:19.734
The revolution, he explained,
wasn't merely a war

20:19.768 --> 20:22.270
for the future of our country.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.672
It would determine
the fate of every man,

20:24.706 --> 20:27.174
woman and child on Earth.

20:28.443 --> 20:30.878
He gave me a mission.

20:30.913 --> 20:33.814
To kill a man who'd reveal
himself on the Hudson shore.

20:33.849 --> 20:36.117
An unknown mercenary

20:36.151 --> 20:38.252
recognizable by a mark
on his hand.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.755
That of a bow.

20:40.789 --> 20:42.490
Okay.

20:42.524 --> 20:43.758
Now, this is crazy.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.459
Which makes it no less real.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.861
Field trip is over.

20:46.895 --> 20:47.995
Let's go.

20:48.030 --> 20:49.263
(Sniffs)

20:49.298 --> 20:52.366
This Bible was left
with me for a reason.

20:52.401 --> 20:53.935
The connections
are all around us.

20:53.969 --> 20:56.170
You just aren't yet
willing to accept them.

20:56.205 --> 20:57.772
Accept what?

20:57.806 --> 20:59.173
That the man I'm after,

20:59.207 --> 21:00.841
the man who killed Corbin,

21:00.876 --> 21:03.778
is one of the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse?

21:03.812 --> 21:06.247
When I beheaded him,
that man didn't die.

21:06.281 --> 21:08.282
Because he was
never a man at all.

21:08.317 --> 21:10.484
He is Death itself, Lieutenant.

21:10.519 --> 21:15.423
And somehow...
he has returned to Sleepy Hollow

21:15.457 --> 21:17.858
to finish what he started.

21:19.728 --> 21:21.662
(Horse neighing)

21:37.179 --> 21:39.580
(Horse neighing nearby)

22:02.404 --> 22:04.272
(Shouts in foreign language)

22:11.613 --> 22:12.947
(Shouting)

22:24.593 --> 22:27.528
I'll never tell you where it is.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.698
I'm prepared to die.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.002
(Squishing thump)

22:35.037 --> 22:37.038
(Body thuds)

22:38.307 --> 22:39.874
(Horse neighs)

22:44.700 --> 22:46.701
(Sirens wailing)

22:50.306 --> 22:52.307
(Indistinct radio transmission)

23:02.283 --> 23:03.984
I need you to stay here.

23:04.019 --> 23:05.519
Oh, no, I...

23:07.255 --> 23:09.023
How do you...

23:09.057 --> 23:10.128
How...

23:10.163 --> 23:12.427
- Captain?
- Not now, Mills.

23:12.461 --> 23:14.095
I want a 20-foot perimeter,

23:14.129 --> 23:15.430
full sweep of all
surveillance cameras...

23:15.464 --> 23:17.632
(Bird screeches,
wings fluttering)

23:23.172 --> 23:26.374
(Screeches)

23:29.111 --> 23:31.479
CAPTAIN: Who the hell
would decapitate a reverend?

23:31.513 --> 23:33.214
This is supposed
to be a nice, quiet town.

23:33.249 --> 23:34.949
You got rosebushes
on every damn block.

23:34.984 --> 23:36.618
The wound's cauterized again.

23:36.652 --> 23:38.786
Same M.O. as the farm.

23:38.821 --> 23:40.688
What the hell is he doing here?

23:40.723 --> 23:41.990
I never authorized his release.

23:42.024 --> 23:43.958
Sir, that's what I was
trying to tell you.

23:43.993 --> 23:45.727
Crane was in my custody
when this happened,

23:45.761 --> 23:48.196
- which means he's not...
- You didn't answer my question.

23:48.230 --> 23:50.999
Why isn't that man locked up
in St. Gregory's?

23:51.033 --> 23:52.534
Captain, someone's on
a killing spree, and that man

23:52.568 --> 23:53.701
is our best chance
of catching him.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.103
That man needs a straightjacket,

23:55.137 --> 23:57.171
and you violated a direct order
by bringing him here.

23:57.206 --> 23:58.640
He saw something,

23:58.674 --> 24:00.008
something that might help us.

24:00.042 --> 24:01.809
This is not your call to make.

24:01.844 --> 24:03.878
Now, you take that man
into a padded cell,

24:03.912 --> 24:06.147
or you're suspended
until further notice.

24:06.181 --> 24:08.183
End of story.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.956
You're hanging yourself
for this guy, Abbie.

24:14.990 --> 24:16.357
Walk away.

24:16.392 --> 24:18.393
Please.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.401
(Bird screeches)

24:29.805 --> 24:31.039
Sir, come with us.

24:31.073 --> 24:32.674
- We need to take you...
- ABBIE: Guys,

24:32.708 --> 24:34.409
guys, he's with me.

24:36.445 --> 24:38.813
I told you to stay in the car.

24:38.847 --> 24:41.249
Yet, as you know, I'm insane

24:41.283 --> 24:43.518
and therefore impervious
to simple commands.

24:43.552 --> 24:45.620
What the hell are you doing?

24:45.654 --> 24:47.755
The bird, it led me here.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.891
A bird led you here.
That's great.

24:53.729 --> 24:55.063
Katrina.

25:01.237 --> 25:03.271
"Burnt for witchcraft."

25:03.305 --> 25:05.506
There's something
you should know.

25:05.541 --> 25:07.876
Something that
I haven't told you.

25:07.910 --> 25:10.245
Crane?

25:10.279 --> 25:12.046
What more do you need
to believe me?

25:12.081 --> 25:14.215
You want me to say
that the killer

25:14.250 --> 25:16.284
is the First Horseman
of the Apocalypse

25:16.318 --> 25:18.887
and my proof is an old Bible
that we found in a cave?

25:18.921 --> 25:21.122
You witnessed your partner's
murder with your own eyes.

25:21.157 --> 25:23.057
Why are you working so hard
to deny it?

25:23.092 --> 25:24.492
Because I do not have the luxury

25:24.527 --> 25:26.561
of giving you the benefit
of the doubt right now.

25:26.595 --> 25:29.164
I am a week away from
leaving, and that man

25:29.198 --> 25:30.965
can end my career,
and you're not helping.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.800
- So let's go.
- No, no, wait.

25:32.835 --> 25:34.068
You're leaving Sleepy Hollow?

25:35.070 --> 25:36.804
Yes.

25:36.839 --> 25:39.174
No, no, you're not.

25:39.208 --> 25:40.775
No, our fates are entwined now.

25:40.810 --> 25:42.744
Running away
isn't gonna change that.

25:44.747 --> 25:47.348
I'm not having this conversation
with you right now.

25:47.383 --> 25:49.651
And even if I thought
what I saw was possible,

25:49.685 --> 25:50.985
I will be alone again,

25:51.020 --> 25:52.921
arguing a case
I do not understand

25:52.955 --> 25:55.757
based on something
that I cannot explain.

25:55.791 --> 25:58.493
Let's go.

25:58.527 --> 26:00.261
Wait, wait.

26:00.296 --> 26:02.197
What do you mean, "again"?

26:02.231 --> 26:03.798
(Sighs)

26:03.833 --> 26:05.533
Nothing.

26:05.568 --> 26:07.402
Something happened to you,
didn't it?

26:07.436 --> 26:08.636
Before all this.

26:08.671 --> 26:10.305
Something that's made you doubt
your perceptions

26:10.339 --> 26:11.940
for quite some time.

26:11.974 --> 26:13.708
Hey, I don't need
to be psychoanalyzed,

26:13.742 --> 26:15.643
or whatever your version is,

26:15.678 --> 26:17.278
by a man who thinks
that only yesterday

26:17.313 --> 26:18.813
he was fighting
for George Washington

26:18.848 --> 26:20.081
in the Revolutionary War.

26:20.115 --> 26:21.983
I'm sorry,

26:22.017 --> 26:25.679
but I need more,
and we both need sleep.

26:36.132 --> 26:37.699
Thank you.

26:37.733 --> 26:40.802
I got you your own cell.

26:40.836 --> 26:42.737
It's the best I could do.

26:42.772 --> 26:46.040
It's a measurable step up
from a cave.

26:46.075 --> 26:47.809
Look,

26:47.843 --> 26:50.345
I don't know how to get my head
around any of this,

26:50.379 --> 26:52.747
but I do get that no matter
what happened to you,

26:52.782 --> 26:55.850
this must all be scary.

27:00.423 --> 27:03.925
Perhaps an asylum
is exactly where I belong.

27:03.959 --> 27:05.960
(Sighing):
All right.

27:08.564 --> 27:10.031
You asked what happened to me.

27:12.435 --> 27:14.436
Back in high school...

27:18.174 --> 27:19.908
me and my sister, Jenny,

27:19.942 --> 27:22.177
were walking home one night

27:22.211 --> 27:24.279
in the forest.

27:24.313 --> 27:27.449
All of a sudden,
there were these...

27:27.483 --> 27:30.318
four white trees.

27:31.454 --> 27:33.688
Something not right about them.

27:33.723 --> 27:36.324
And then,

27:36.359 --> 27:38.426
there was this voice.

27:38.461 --> 27:40.228
(Bellowing)

27:40.262 --> 27:41.930
I couldn't see it clearly.

27:41.964 --> 27:44.399
I couldn't tell if it was
a person or a thing.

27:44.433 --> 27:47.202
And, uh,

27:47.236 --> 27:49.704
we blacked out.

27:49.739 --> 27:51.740
(Chuckles)
Next thing we knew,

27:51.774 --> 27:53.441
someone found us
on the side of the road,

27:53.476 --> 27:56.044
and everyone said we were crazy.

27:56.078 --> 27:59.948
I guess, after a while,
Jenny started believing it.

27:59.982 --> 28:02.283
Where is she now?

28:02.318 --> 28:04.586
In and out of places like this.

28:06.122 --> 28:08.690
She's battling demons.

28:10.793 --> 28:12.694
But then,

28:12.728 --> 28:14.362
you showed up,

28:14.397 --> 28:16.798
and everyone said
that you were crazy.

28:18.467 --> 28:21.536
So I guess I just know
what that feels like.

28:23.940 --> 28:25.807
(Door opens)

28:25.841 --> 28:26.908
It's lights-out.

28:26.942 --> 28:28.643
Okay. Thank you.

28:28.678 --> 28:31.446
Suppose this is farewell,
Lieutenant.

28:31.480 --> 28:33.448
You can call me Abbie.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.322
I'm very sorry
about your partner.

29:13.155 --> 29:14.823
(Metallic clinking)

29:51.444 --> 29:52.918
AUGUST:
There were 100 witches

29:52.953 --> 29:54.362
who were put to death
in Sleepy Hollow

29:54.397 --> 29:57.532
between 1712 and 1816.

29:57.567 --> 29:59.367
(Tape rewinding)

29:59.402 --> 30:01.703
Town records suggest members
of two different covens

30:01.737 --> 30:03.338
integrated into the populace

30:03.372 --> 30:06.308
and changed their names
to stay hidden.

30:06.342 --> 30:09.044
Others spread out
across the east coast.

30:09.078 --> 30:11.980
Two covens representing good
and evil.

30:12.014 --> 30:13.448
(Tape rewinding)

30:13.482 --> 30:15.484
I found hundreds
of unsolved cases.

30:15.518 --> 30:17.252
Just seem to have been ignored.

30:17.286 --> 30:19.321
Murders, disappearances,

30:19.355 --> 30:21.022
and it's not just here.

30:21.057 --> 30:23.925
The cases track through Boston,
DC, Manhattan.

30:23.960 --> 30:25.460
I know they're all connected.

30:25.495 --> 30:27.796
I just... I don't know how.

30:27.830 --> 30:31.066
Case file 632,
Abigail and Jennifer Mills,

30:31.100 --> 30:33.869
sisters who describe seeing
a demon-like figure

30:33.903 --> 30:36.605
linked to four white trees
that appeared out of nowhere.

30:37.771 --> 30:40.328
This correlates
with a local farmer in 1882

30:40.363 --> 30:41.576
who claimed to see
the same thing

30:41.611 --> 30:44.179
in the exact same location.

30:44.213 --> 30:45.947
He believed the trees
were symbols

30:45.982 --> 30:48.750
representing the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse

30:48.784 --> 30:51.720
and that the Demon was sent here
to raise them.

30:51.754 --> 30:54.089
I don't know what to believe.

30:54.123 --> 30:56.725
I want to tell Abbie
what I found.

30:56.759 --> 31:00.061
I just-just don't know how.

31:00.096 --> 31:02.597
I look around this town, I don't
know who to trust anymore.

31:02.632 --> 31:04.699
Closer I get to this,

31:04.734 --> 31:07.736
the closer I feel
something is getting to me.

31:07.770 --> 31:09.805
CAPTAIN:
What are you doing?

31:12.175 --> 31:14.376
I was just looking
through old case files

31:14.410 --> 31:16.244
for something that might help.

31:16.279 --> 31:17.946
There's nothing here.

31:17.980 --> 31:19.981
Look, I'm not gonna
say this again.

31:20.016 --> 31:22.317
Let us do our job.

31:22.351 --> 31:24.019
Get some rest.

31:25.430 --> 31:27.541
Thank you, sir.

31:37.179 --> 31:39.180
(Wings fluttering)

31:58.000 --> 32:00.535
Katrina?

32:00.569 --> 32:02.270
Forgive me, my love.

32:02.304 --> 32:06.107
This is the only way
I could reach you.

32:06.142 --> 32:08.576
I've been trying to lead you.

32:10.112 --> 32:12.247
The gravestone.

32:12.281 --> 32:15.116
My body was never buried
in that grave.

32:15.151 --> 32:18.052
It hides the true location
of the Horseman's skull,

32:18.087 --> 32:21.122
guarded throughout time
by one of my coven.

32:22.092 --> 32:24.059
We don't have much time.

32:25.127 --> 32:26.861
Then...

32:26.896 --> 32:28.897
Then you are a witch.

32:28.931 --> 32:31.499
We are part of an ancient order

32:31.534 --> 32:34.302
sworn to fight the darkness
that hides in Sleepy Hollow.

32:34.336 --> 32:36.037
When you wounded

32:36.072 --> 32:38.073
the Horseman,
your bloodlines merged.

32:39.608 --> 32:43.078
You became linked,
bound together by blood.

32:48.618 --> 32:51.920
The only way to stop him
was to cast a spell on you both.

32:51.954 --> 32:53.588
Then we entombed
the Horseman's body

32:53.622 --> 32:55.757
deep below the river.

32:59.362 --> 33:02.397
We buried you in that cave
to protect you.

33:02.431 --> 33:04.599
Then you didn't awaken me.

33:04.633 --> 33:07.502
It's the Horseman
who's been awakened, Ichabod...

33:07.536 --> 33:09.504
And you along with him.

33:09.538 --> 33:10.905
How?

33:10.940 --> 33:11.973
By who?

33:12.007 --> 33:14.576
By the same evil
that's trapped me here,

33:14.610 --> 33:17.078
the very one that controls
the Horseman now.

33:18.614 --> 33:22.617
(Distant breathing, snarling)

33:22.652 --> 33:24.452
It's found us.
There isn't time.

33:26.489 --> 33:29.257
If the Horseman reclaims his skull,
he'll become whole again.

33:30.393 --> 33:33.028
Three more will follow,
and then it will begin.

33:33.062 --> 33:34.295
What will begin?

33:34.330 --> 33:35.964
The end.

33:35.998 --> 33:39.200
You must stop the Horseman
from retrieving his skull.

33:39.235 --> 33:43.171
Remember, light is his weakness.
He can't survive the sunrise.

33:43.205 --> 33:45.307
Find me, please.
Free me from this place!

33:45.341 --> 33:47.509
How? I don't understand.

33:48.711 --> 33:50.679
The answers are in
Washington's Bible.

33:50.713 --> 33:53.048
- You are the First Witness, Ichabod.
- Katrina!

33:53.082 --> 33:55.334
- Now, please, wake up!
- Katrina, wait!

33:55.518 --> 33:57.052
Wake up!

33:57.086 --> 33:58.386
(Gasps)
(Beast growls)

33:58.421 --> 34:00.488
Find the skull!

34:00.523 --> 34:01.990
No! No!

34:02.024 --> 34:05.026
No! No, no! Stop!

34:05.061 --> 34:06.227
What-what...!

34:06.262 --> 34:07.729
This will help calm you down.

34:07.763 --> 34:11.232
I know what he wants. All right,
if you have to, let me...

34:11.266 --> 34:13.335
Stop! I'm taking him
back into custody.

34:13.369 --> 34:15.570
- Crane, get your things.
- Officer, this man is not fit

34:15.603 --> 34:17.339
to be moved.

34:17.373 --> 34:19.306
Stand down and
let me do my job!

34:19.342 --> 34:20.708
Let's go.

34:24.514 --> 34:25.647
Walk fast.

34:25.681 --> 34:27.748
We got about one minute
till she realizes

34:27.784 --> 34:29.685
that court order's
a practice sheet

34:29.719 --> 34:31.386
from my Academy exam.

34:32.922 --> 34:35.357
I know what
the Horseman's after.

34:37.393 --> 34:39.393
Corbin had a cabinet
full of case files,

34:39.428 --> 34:43.197
hundreds of them, and this.

34:44.234 --> 34:47.369
It's a map of the Hudson valley
charted in 1776.

34:47.404 --> 34:49.605
Guess whose signature
is at the bottom.

34:51.741 --> 34:54.009
I've seen this before.

34:55.545 --> 34:57.079
Washington
used to personally survey

34:57.112 --> 34:59.548
all the field sketches
for battle.

34:59.582 --> 35:02.785
Corbin marked sites around town
he thought had some meaning,

35:02.819 --> 35:04.453
like a puzzle he was trying
to put together.

35:05.789 --> 35:07.790
How did this end up
in your sheriff's cabinet?

35:10.660 --> 35:12.561
I don't know. I don't
think it was an accident.

35:12.595 --> 35:14.897
That night that he arrested me,

35:14.931 --> 35:16.965
he knew what happened
with me and my sister.

35:18.468 --> 35:19.968
He believed it was real.

35:20.003 --> 35:22.037
It is real, Miss Mills...

35:22.072 --> 35:25.541
The faceless figure,
the four trees.

35:25.575 --> 35:28.210
I saw it as well.

35:32.048 --> 35:33.816
(Sighs)

35:33.850 --> 35:36.218
(Low growl)

35:39.622 --> 35:41.323
(Horse whinnies)

35:47.630 --> 35:48.997
ABBIE:
Andy, please,

35:49.032 --> 35:51.233
I need you to call in all units.

35:51.267 --> 35:53.168
Andy, I know what he's after.

35:53.203 --> 35:55.471
I'm telling you,
it's at the church.

35:55.505 --> 35:57.005
Whoa, whoa. You know this how?

35:57.040 --> 35:58.273
Because of that whack-job?

35:58.308 --> 35:59.842
I'll explain everything.
Just get them there.

35:59.876 --> 36:01.176
If I have to go through Irving,

36:01.211 --> 36:02.511
he'll ask for proof
that I can't give yet,

36:02.545 --> 36:04.513
and the department
is spread thin as it is.

36:04.547 --> 36:06.749
No kidding.
I just worked a 36-hour shift.

36:06.783 --> 36:08.684
Just getting home.

36:08.718 --> 36:10.753
Look, I'm right about this!
I need to get this guy.

36:10.787 --> 36:13.188
And if you're wrong,
it's on both of us.

36:13.223 --> 36:14.990
Andy, trust me.

36:15.025 --> 36:16.792
Please.

36:16.826 --> 36:18.260
All right, I'll call it in.

36:18.294 --> 36:19.528
I'll meet you there.

36:19.562 --> 36:21.030
Thank you.

36:34.878 --> 36:37.179
(Door creaks)

37:03.873 --> 37:06.942
(Panting)

37:06.977 --> 37:09.411
I know where it is.

37:41.603 --> 37:43.538
Oh, my God.

37:48.944 --> 37:52.013
(Horse whinnies,
hoofbeats approach)

37:55.784 --> 37:57.718
(Gasps)

37:57.753 --> 38:00.021
(Horse whinnies)

38:00.055 --> 38:03.524
(Shotgun blasting repeatedly)

38:18.207 --> 38:20.208
(Horse neighs)

38:43.966 --> 38:45.366
You all right?

38:45.401 --> 38:47.935
I need a rifle
from your trunk now.

38:47.970 --> 38:49.137
Where's backup?

38:49.171 --> 38:50.738
I don't know.
I-I called it in.

38:50.773 --> 38:52.106
Metro, officers...

38:52.141 --> 38:53.674
(Blow lands)

38:55.377 --> 38:56.711
(Crane yells)

39:07.022 --> 39:09.090
Andy...?

39:09.124 --> 39:12.160
I told you
to stay away from him.

39:12.194 --> 39:15.429
- I tried, but you didn't listen.
- Please.

39:23.062 --> 39:24.604
- It's okay.
- Andy, please.

39:24.718 --> 39:27.310
I want to protect you.
I'm gonna protect you.

39:27.430 --> 39:29.003
(Andy screams)

39:41.790 --> 39:43.091
Lieutenant!

39:43.125 --> 39:46.527
- Abbie, Abbie...
- Cuff yourself to the door.

39:46.562 --> 39:49.597
You can't kill him, Abbie.
He is Death.

39:49.631 --> 39:50.598
Do it!

39:50.632 --> 39:52.333
(Sirens approach)

39:55.537 --> 39:59.607
Put the weapon down!
Put your hands on your...!

39:59.642 --> 40:01.309
What the hell is that?

40:01.343 --> 40:04.112
Do it now!

40:04.146 --> 40:05.279
You think he can hear us?

40:05.314 --> 40:08.613
- I mean, he...
- How the hell should I know?

40:08.648 --> 40:10.151
(Sizzling)

40:14.857 --> 40:16.491
I said put the weapon down...!

40:24.700 --> 40:27.335
You can't kill him.

40:27.369 --> 40:28.569
He won't die, Abbie!

40:28.604 --> 40:30.638
(Horse whinnies,
departing hoofbeats)

40:38.714 --> 40:40.381
(Horse whinnies)

40:40.416 --> 40:41.983
Crane! Whoa!

40:42.017 --> 40:43.351
Whoa. I called you.

40:44.420 --> 40:45.853
Lieutenant?

40:46.722 --> 40:48.222
Hey! No!

40:48.257 --> 40:49.590
He's with me.

40:51.460 --> 40:53.227
CRANE:
I'm all right.

41:03.372 --> 41:04.739
(Sirens approach)

41:19.221 --> 41:21.623
IRVING:
I ought to throw you in jail.

41:21.657 --> 41:24.025
Except I have a preserved head
in a pickle jar

41:24.059 --> 41:26.394
and two cops who just
backed up your story.

41:26.428 --> 41:28.196
Not to mention a
confession from Brooks,

41:28.230 --> 41:29.731
who says he'll plea-bargain,

41:29.765 --> 41:33.167
but only if he talks to you
and Captain America here.

41:33.202 --> 41:34.168
Hmm?

41:34.203 --> 41:35.603
IRVING:
Now, there's a room

41:35.638 --> 41:37.739
full of press looking
for answers that I don't have.

41:37.773 --> 41:41.276
So why don't you help me
for a change and give me some?

41:41.310 --> 41:42.343
The truth, sir?

41:42.378 --> 41:43.745
We're just scratching
the surface here.

41:43.779 --> 41:46.014
Whatever this is,
it's gonna get a lot worse.

41:47.550 --> 41:49.417
Outstanding.

41:49.451 --> 41:51.920
I'm told you're transferring
to Quantico next week?

41:54.423 --> 41:55.556
Not anymore.

41:58.160 --> 42:02.263
I think this is where
I'm supposed to be.

42:03.332 --> 42:05.400
IRVING:
That man is our only lead.

42:05.434 --> 42:06.834
He has answers.

42:06.869 --> 42:08.970
Go get me something
I can understand.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.338
Both of you.

42:14.343 --> 42:17.845
There's something
you should know.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.247
In my dream,

42:19.281 --> 42:21.449
Katrina referred to me
as "the First Witness."

42:21.484 --> 42:23.952
Revelations.

42:23.986 --> 42:26.588
This speaks of two
witnesses, brought together

42:26.622 --> 42:28.923
for a seven-year
"period of tribulation"

42:28.958 --> 42:30.925
to defend humanity
from the forces of hell.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.261
Their battle is prophesied

42:33.295 --> 42:36.231
to ordain the fate of the world...

42:36.265 --> 42:37.765
on judgment day.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.535
You think that's us?

42:40.569 --> 42:43.404
You said, after the woods,
you lost your way...

42:43.439 --> 42:45.974
But perhaps you were
called to something, Abbie.

42:46.008 --> 42:49.143
To finish the work
your sheriff started.

42:50.646 --> 42:52.814
Perhaps we both were.

42:57.953 --> 43:00.655
Brooks said a war was coming.

43:02.491 --> 43:05.360
Let's find out
what else he knows.

43:17.640 --> 43:20.441
Please, give me another chance.

43:20.476 --> 43:22.710
(Door creaks)

43:25.994 --> 43:27.118
Please.

43:41.731 --> 43:44.265
MALE VOICE:
And I heard, as it were,

43:44.300 --> 43:46.167
the noise of thunder,

43:46.202 --> 43:49.471
one of the four beasts saying,
"Come and see."

43:49.505 --> 43:50.505
(Shrieking)

43:51.974 --> 43:54.285
Then behold a pale horse,

43:54.320 --> 43:57.412
and his name that sat
on him was Death,

43:57.446 --> 43:59.948
and hell followed with him.

44:00.182 --> 44:03.945
