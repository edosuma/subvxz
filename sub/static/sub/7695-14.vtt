00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.179 --> 00:11.612
Uh, Bob?

00:11.612 --> 00:14.345
Why are you
wrapped in tin foil?

00:14.345 --> 00:16.015
It's not just tin foil.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.718
I'm also wearing
three layers of pasta,

00:17.718 --> 00:19.720
tomato sauce and cheese.

00:20.751 --> 00:23.794
I turned him into
a human lasagna pan.

00:23.794 --> 00:25.926
Forty-five minutes
in the sun,

00:25.926 --> 00:28.159
and it's Bob appetit.

00:28.159 --> 00:29.900
You know,

00:29.900 --> 00:31.932
given what I've seen
of Bob's training,

00:31.932 --> 00:34.565
this might be the most
productive use of him yet.

00:35.666 --> 00:38.709
Mm, don't move.
You need more oregano.

00:40.211 --> 00:42.713
Mm, lasagna!
Got any garlic bread?

00:42.713 --> 00:45.746
You betcha.
They're strapped to my shins.

00:46.877 --> 00:48.779
I'll be back.

00:48.779 --> 00:50.281
Save me
the greasiest piece.

00:51.722 --> 00:54.685
Hey, where are you
off to,

00:54.685 --> 00:56.727
and how long
can you stay there?

00:56.727 --> 00:59.960
Your cheap father
forgot to pay the trash bill.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.333
I am so sick of
working for a guy

01:02.333 --> 01:04.595
who won't let me
throw trash in the ocean.

01:07.638 --> 01:10.441
Guys, check it out.

01:10.441 --> 01:14.275
This is gonna change
our bionic academy forever.

01:14.275 --> 01:18.679
I found a way to replicate
Chase's bionic intelligence.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.981
- What?
- Yeah.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.653
Remember how Giselle Vickers
wanted to give

01:22.653 --> 01:24.515
your intelligence to
all of her androids?

01:24.515 --> 01:26.387
Well, this intelligence
duplicator

01:26.387 --> 01:30.261
will wirelessly add it
to everyone's chip.

01:30.261 --> 01:34.295
Wait, so you're gonna
make me like him?

01:34.295 --> 01:36.026
Pass.

01:36.026 --> 01:37.598
Don't worry.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.270
The four of you
won't be affected.

01:39.270 --> 01:41.071
Your chips are
older models,

01:41.071 --> 01:43.003
and Leo doesn't
have one.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.875
But if this works,

01:44.875 --> 01:48.479
all the students will be
just as smart as you.

01:48.479 --> 01:50.941
I just have to find
someone to test it on.

01:50.941 --> 01:53.344
And do you really think
someone's gonna just let you

01:53.344 --> 01:55.186
randomly experiment
on them?

01:55.186 --> 01:57.848
Sorry, Bob.
It's getting cloudy.

01:57.848 --> 02:00.251
I'm gonna have to cook you
in here with my heat vision.

02:00.251 --> 02:01.852
Will it hurt?

02:01.852 --> 02:04.225
Let's find out
together.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.727
Okay.

02:11.902 --> 02:14.165
Ooh, something's cookin'!

02:17.508 --> 02:18.969
Bob it is.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.874
The world's first
 bionic superhumans.

02:23.874 --> 02:25.676
They're stronger than us.

02:25.676 --> 02:28.048
Faster.
 Smarter.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.881
The next generation
 of the human race is...

02:30.881 --> 02:32.823
living on a bionic island.

03:09.890 --> 03:13.324
All right, Bob,
now that we've made
body lasagna,

03:13.324 --> 03:15.826
we should do
something important.

03:15.826 --> 03:18.168
What do you think,
CPR training,
volunteer work?

03:18.168 --> 03:19.970
Oh, got it.

03:19.970 --> 03:21.672
We should figure out
how many students

03:21.672 --> 03:22.903
we can cram
into the pool.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.576
Easy. All you have to do
is divide

03:25.576 --> 03:27.007
the average mass of
the students

03:27.007 --> 03:28.939
by the pool's
volumetric capacity.

03:28.939 --> 03:32.443
Whoa! What did you do
to my Bob?

03:32.443 --> 03:34.315
Thanks to my intelligence
upgrade,

03:34.315 --> 03:38.118
Bob is now as brilliant
as Chase.

03:38.118 --> 03:41.652
Yep, I'm finally
the whole package.

03:41.652 --> 03:43.594
Isn't it great?

03:43.594 --> 03:45.526
I have an intellectual peer.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.698
We've been bonding for hours
about the stock market,

03:47.698 --> 03:50.631
physics and ancient
philosophies.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.963
Although we did have
that tiff about Socrates.

03:52.963 --> 03:55.966
Ah, good times.

03:55.966 --> 03:58.539
Bob, you're scaring me.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.241
I demand you burp
the entire alphabet right now.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.073
Can you believe it?

04:03.073 --> 04:06.877
Douglas' intelligence
duplicator actually worked.

04:06.877 --> 04:08.319
Actually?

04:08.319 --> 04:10.351
You don't have
the best track record.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.483
I made you, didn't I?

04:12.483 --> 04:14.685
Hey, look.

04:14.685 --> 04:17.528
Leftover lasagna.

04:17.528 --> 04:20.060
And you also
made him.

04:24.295 --> 04:28.639
( humming fanfare )

04:30.200 --> 04:33.404
Welcome to the United
Republic of Perryland.

04:33.404 --> 04:35.306
I know I'm gonna
regret this,

04:35.306 --> 04:37.378
but what's Perryland?

04:37.378 --> 04:39.750
And why does the flag
have a cow on it?

04:39.750 --> 04:41.982
That's an ox.
Know your meats.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.885
When I went to pay
the garbage bill,

04:44.885 --> 04:48.489
they told me that
you'd never registered
the island as a country,

04:48.489 --> 04:50.891
so I seized
the opportunity.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.863
As of today, you're all
second-class citizens

04:52.863 --> 04:55.265
of Perryland.

04:55.265 --> 04:58.869
This is the official charter.
Read it and weep.

04:58.869 --> 05:01.201
You expect us
to believe that's real?

05:01.201 --> 05:04.004
- Oh, it's real.
Just ask my muscle.
- ( blows whistle )

05:10.140 --> 05:13.914
This is bad.
This is very, very bad.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.716
Who are they?

05:15.716 --> 05:18.018
They're on loan from
a tyrant friend of mine.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.790
And speaking of tyrants,

05:19.790 --> 05:22.793
guess who the dictator
of Perryland is.

05:22.793 --> 05:26.597
Your cat, Mr. Whiskers?

05:26.597 --> 05:28.559
Don't be ridiculous.

05:28.559 --> 05:30.961
He's vice-dictator,
and he reports to me.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.104
Now join me in singing

05:34.104 --> 05:35.706
the Perryland
national anthem.

05:36.867 --> 05:40.771
( operatic voice )
♪ O, Perryland ♪

05:40.771 --> 05:45.045
♪ You're all at
my command ♪

05:45.045 --> 05:48.919
♪ You'll do what I say ♪

05:48.919 --> 05:53.123

rack of lamb ♪

05:53.123 --> 05:57.127

05:57.127 --> 06:01.131

06:01.131 --> 06:05.836

06:09.400 --> 06:13.043
♪ O Perryland ♪

06:13.043 --> 06:21.011
♪ I stand on top of you ♪

06:22.653 --> 06:25.215
When did you
have time to write that?

06:28.088 --> 06:31.191
( bell dinging )

06:31.191 --> 06:34.364
Ah, you're still
hanging out with Chase?

06:34.364 --> 06:36.527
No one should
have to suffer that long.

06:38.168 --> 06:40.000
Great game.
Another draw.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.172
Wanna go triple-check
your homework?

06:42.172 --> 06:45.536
I already did,
but one can never
be too right.

06:45.536 --> 06:50.140
You know, if signs
of affection didn't
strike me as frivolous,

06:50.140 --> 06:52.182
I'd hug you right now.

06:52.182 --> 06:53.313
Oh, what the heck.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.947
Whoa, whoa, Bob.

06:56.947 --> 06:58.619
Why waste your time
doing stupid science stuff

06:58.619 --> 07:00.921
when we can do
something useful.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.523
Let's go grab
a couple jellyfish

07:02.523 --> 07:04.455
and wear 'em as wigs.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.099
I'm sorry, old friend,
but I'm afraid we don't have

07:09.099 --> 07:10.761
much in common anymore.

07:14.765 --> 07:16.507
I can't believe this.

07:16.507 --> 07:18.308
You stole my best friend.

07:18.308 --> 07:20.541
I did not steal him.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.042
We just...

07:22.042 --> 07:24.144
Yeah, you know what,
you're right.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.876
I stole him.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.520
You know what? Fine.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.522
I don't need you guys.

07:31.522 --> 07:34.254
Still got my bionic
bros, right, guys?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.656
Aw, quit reading.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.859
I told you it was
bad for you.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.891
Douglas, what is going
on with them?

07:40.891 --> 07:42.092
Not a thing.

07:42.092 --> 07:45.065
My intelligence upgrade
worked so well on Bob,

07:45.065 --> 07:47.998
I decided to give it
to all the other students.

07:47.998 --> 07:50.400
What?!

07:50.400 --> 07:53.103
First you steal my Bob,
then you take my...

07:53.103 --> 07:54.444
that guy,
that guy and him?

07:55.646 --> 07:57.447
Who wants to discover
a new element

07:57.447 --> 07:59.009
for the periodic table?

07:59.009 --> 08:01.481
ALL: Yeah!

08:04.615 --> 08:06.256
Don't worry, Adam.

08:06.256 --> 08:08.018
I'll be your friend.

08:08.018 --> 08:09.860
( scoffs )
I'm not that hard up.

08:18.699 --> 08:22.973
You cannot just come in here
and take over our home.

08:22.973 --> 08:24.605
Of course I can.

08:24.605 --> 08:28.138
In Perryland, Perry does
whatever Perry wants.

08:28.138 --> 08:30.110
Okay, look, you may
own the island,

08:30.110 --> 08:32.111
but we still need
to sleep in our capsules.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.985
Fine. Because Dear Leader
is a compassionate goddess,

08:34.985 --> 08:36.787
you may recharge
your robot batteries

08:36.787 --> 08:38.418
right before bedtime.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.921
And FYI, I changed the lock
on that door,

08:40.921 --> 08:43.123
so you're gonna have
to buy key cards from me.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.254
Twenty bucks each.

08:44.254 --> 08:45.626
- What?
- That's insane!

08:45.626 --> 08:47.257
Fine. They're 40 bucks.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.132
Now get out of here.
I have work to do.

08:53.964 --> 08:55.235
What is that?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.367
Sand to fill
the pool with.

08:57.367 --> 08:59.910
Vice-dictator Mr. Whiskers
is helicoptering in tomorrow,

08:59.910 --> 09:02.973
and he demanded
a much bigger litter box.

09:02.973 --> 09:05.275
- Ew.
- That's disgusting.

09:05.275 --> 09:08.178
Don't worry, you can still
swim in it.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.521
It's not that funny.
Get back to work.

09:14.224 --> 09:16.186
I can't even fathom
what we were like

09:16.186 --> 09:17.858
before the intelligence
upgrade.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.560
I mean, how obtuse was I?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.894
I was so beyond obtuse,
I was Bob-tuse.

09:26.867 --> 09:30.470
I cannot live in a world
with this many Chases.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.172
I have bigger problems.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.905
I just found out that
Perry now owns the island,

09:34.905 --> 09:37.207
and has installed herself
as dictator.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.009
Oh, that explains why
her face is on

09:39.009 --> 09:40.681
all of the toilet seats.

09:40.681 --> 09:44.054
The first law that
"Dear Leader" Perry passed

09:44.054 --> 09:46.016
says that I must serve
as her personal servant

09:46.016 --> 09:48.058
and massage therapist.

09:48.058 --> 09:50.691
It's about time
somebody put you to work.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.723
What do you
do here again?

09:52.723 --> 09:54.865
I have to go fix this.

09:54.865 --> 09:57.567
Okay, but Douglas,
before you go, can you please...

09:59.770 --> 10:03.934
Oh, the frivolities
of your consistent blunders.

10:05.235 --> 10:06.236
That's it, Bob.

10:06.236 --> 10:09.109
Douglas won't fix you,
I will.

10:15.145 --> 10:16.316
All right,
that should do it.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.048
Let's see if it worked.

10:18.048 --> 10:20.550
Quick, Bob, spell
your name backwards.

10:20.550 --> 10:23.924
( bleating )

10:23.924 --> 10:25.826
Uh-oh.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.197
Guys, what's wrong
with Bob?

10:27.197 --> 10:30.100
( all bleating )

10:30.100 --> 10:32.402
Adam.

10:32.402 --> 10:34.004
What's going on?

10:34.004 --> 10:36.306
I was trying to dial
everyone's intelligence level

10:36.306 --> 10:38.809
back to normal and...

10:38.809 --> 10:41.511
Oh, what do you
want from me?
I'm obtuse.

10:41.511 --> 10:44.514
You must've dialed it
back too far.

10:44.514 --> 10:45.816
You downgraded
their intelligence

10:45.816 --> 10:47.377
to the level
of a farm animal.

10:47.377 --> 10:49.349
Yeah, well, for Bob,
that's still an upgrade.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.221
You don't get it.

10:51.221 --> 10:54.384
Bob and all the students
are brainless zombies.

10:54.384 --> 10:56.026
Then we'll dial it back.

10:56.026 --> 10:58.358
Where's the intelligence
duplicator?

10:58.358 --> 11:01.231
( loud chewing )

11:01.231 --> 11:04.394
No, no, no, no, no, no!

11:04.394 --> 11:06.336
Hey, in my defense,

11:06.336 --> 11:08.598
normal Bob probably
would've done that, too.

11:14.604 --> 11:17.477
( bleating continues )

11:17.477 --> 11:19.910
Now that Bob destroyed
the intelligence duplicator,

11:19.910 --> 11:21.782
there's no way to turn
them back to normal.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.054
No problem. We'll just
get rid of these students,

11:24.054 --> 11:25.916
and have Douglas
whip us up a new batch.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.387
Adam!

11:27.387 --> 11:29.720
Calm down. It's not like
they're a danger to anyone.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.723
Yes, they are.
They're a danger
to themselves.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.328
What are we gonna do?

11:38.328 --> 11:40.270
If we can't find
a way to bring them back,

11:40.270 --> 11:42.302
every one of our students
will be completely useless.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.974
- ( chewing )
- Ugh.

11:45.375 --> 11:46.837
Worse than that,

11:46.837 --> 11:48.879
I think you and I
are gonna be on the hook

11:48.879 --> 11:51.241
for some very
expensive dental work.

11:53.643 --> 11:56.286
Make every mole count.

11:58.688 --> 12:00.420
Hey, Perryland peasants.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.492
Check out this thing
I found in the weapons room.

12:02.492 --> 12:04.324
It shoots lasers.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.797
What were you doing
in our weapons room?

12:06.797 --> 12:08.328
Leveling the playing field.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.000
You never know when
you machine people

12:10.000 --> 12:12.332
are gonna turn on
us fleshies.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.405
( bleating )

12:15.405 --> 12:16.867
What's going on?

12:16.867 --> 12:18.468
I don't know.

12:18.468 --> 12:20.070
It's a rebellion.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.311
They're trying
to take me out

12:21.311 --> 12:22.913
so that they can
rule Perryland.

12:22.913 --> 12:24.314
The only way
that's gonna happen

12:24.314 --> 12:26.416
is over
Dear Leader's dead body.

12:26.416 --> 12:28.318
Well, you had
a good run.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.952
Back off. I've got
a battle to fight.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.284
No, you cannot attack them.
They're innocent.

12:34.284 --> 12:35.685
I'm not gonna attack them.

12:35.685 --> 12:37.687
I'm just gonna give them
a gentle warning.

12:37.687 --> 12:39.860
A gentle 15,000-volt warning.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.132
Get down, get down!

12:46.536 --> 12:48.268
That's how it works.

12:51.802 --> 12:54.674
Ah, come on.
Get back together!

12:54.674 --> 12:57.607
Wow, I can't believe
that didn't work.

12:57.607 --> 13:00.450
I don't see you
doing anything.

13:00.450 --> 13:02.382
This is all your fault.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.984
We wouldn't even
be in this mess

13:03.984 --> 13:06.016
if you hadn't touched
the device in the first place.

13:06.016 --> 13:07.988
You don't have
any proof of that.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.420
The only person who knows
whether I did it or not is me,

13:10.420 --> 13:12.222
'cause I was
the one who did it.

13:13.623 --> 13:15.795
And I wouldn't have
touched the device

13:15.795 --> 13:17.567
if you hadn't stolen
my best friend.

13:17.567 --> 13:20.000
Oh, well, excuse me
for finally having

13:20.000 --> 13:22.572
a person around here
I can relate to.

13:29.039 --> 13:33.844
Chase, why does it sound
like a bionic barnyard in here?

13:33.844 --> 13:37.347
Adam used your
intelligence duplicator

13:37.347 --> 13:40.350
and turned all of our students
into mindless zombies.

13:41.591 --> 13:44.194
Kinda funny, right?

13:44.194 --> 13:45.926
Then Bob ate the device,

13:45.926 --> 13:48.028
so we have no way
of turning them back to normal.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.730
See? This is why
I always have to make

13:50.730 --> 13:52.903
two of everything
around here.

13:52.903 --> 13:55.135
Yes! Problem solved.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.367
( screaming )

13:57.367 --> 14:00.510
Sound the alarm.
Perry's on a rampage.

14:00.510 --> 14:02.842
I don't wanna hurt you.
I just wanna shoot you
with a laser.

14:06.076 --> 14:08.048
Come on!

14:08.048 --> 14:10.080
Any chance you make
three of everything?

14:10.080 --> 14:11.481
What is going on?

14:11.481 --> 14:13.954
Why are you
shooting at them?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.086
These students are trying
to oust me from power.

14:16.086 --> 14:17.457
- No, they're not.
- They're not?

14:17.457 --> 14:18.488
- No.
- Oh, okay.

14:20.090 --> 14:22.632
I have been telling you that
for an hour.

14:22.632 --> 14:24.834
Why do you stop
when he tells you?

14:24.834 --> 14:27.467
Because he's
the future king.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.571
So much for
an easy fix.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.844
Now I have to build
a new duplicator
from scratch.

14:34.844 --> 14:36.876
Well, as long as
you don't tap into

14:36.876 --> 14:40.080
their bionics, there's
only so much damage they can do.

14:47.617 --> 14:49.119
You were saying.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.622
They're gonna
destroy everything.

14:52.622 --> 14:53.964
So what do we do
with 'em?

14:53.964 --> 14:56.266
I have an idea.

14:58.468 --> 15:00.630
( all bleating )

15:02.302 --> 15:04.004
Good idea, Adam.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.505
I can't believe
they're not smart enough

15:05.505 --> 15:07.637
to find their way
out of the pool.

15:07.637 --> 15:10.010
We can finally figure out
how many people we can
cram in there.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.312
Everybody count off.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.913
( bleating continues )

15:13.913 --> 15:17.517
Hold on.
Somebody said five twice.

15:18.818 --> 15:21.451
Hey, whatever happened
to your military goon squad?

15:21.451 --> 15:23.323
When they found out
they weren't getting paid,

15:23.323 --> 15:25.725
they threatened to quit,
so I had to fire on them.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.559
- You mean fire them.
- Nope.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.263
Okay.
This better work.

15:33.263 --> 15:34.965
Otherwise I'll have to
get rid of these kids

15:34.965 --> 15:36.606
and whip up
a whole new batch.

15:36.606 --> 15:38.708
That's what I said.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.679
Bob, name an element
in the periodic table.

15:49.679 --> 15:52.622
Uh, lasagna.

15:52.622 --> 15:55.455
That's my Bob.
Welcome back, buddy.

15:57.857 --> 16:01.561
I'll be inside
preparing for
the royal bathing.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.993
Good news.

16:02.993 --> 16:05.465
You two get to
scrape my heels.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.439
So what do we do?

16:09.439 --> 16:11.301
Same thing I did
in high school detention.

16:11.301 --> 16:13.473
Grab a bucket
and a cheese grater,

16:13.473 --> 16:15.705
and let your mind
drift somewhere else.

16:15.705 --> 16:17.307
I went through
all the paperwork,

16:17.307 --> 16:18.878
and I can't find
a legal fix

16:18.878 --> 16:21.051
that will remove her
from power.

16:21.051 --> 16:23.453
Then I'm afraid
we have no choice.

16:23.453 --> 16:25.615
We have to relocate
the academy.

16:25.615 --> 16:28.218
Well, there is
one possible legal solution.

16:28.218 --> 16:30.490
If Perry were married,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.662
her spouse would own
half the island, too.

16:32.662 --> 16:34.764
Yeah, but...
( laughs )

16:34.764 --> 16:36.826
We all know that there's
no person in their right mind

16:36.826 --> 16:38.628
who's gonna marry her.

16:45.735 --> 16:48.978
I can't believe
this is happening.

16:48.978 --> 16:51.541
I can't believe
Perry only has one guest.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.418
All right,
I signed up online.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.291
I'm officially allowed
to marry you and Perry.

17:01.291 --> 17:04.194
You almost look official.
Nice touch with the robe.

17:04.194 --> 17:06.356
Oh, no, this was just
'cause I was chilly.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.501
All right, let's do this.
Hit it, Bob.

17:11.501 --> 17:15.704
( synthesized
polka music plays )

17:18.568 --> 17:22.742
( processional music plays )

17:33.353 --> 17:35.755
( music switches to
"Here Comes the Bride" )

17:44.864 --> 17:46.866
Thank you for coming.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.703
Aren't you gonna
lift my veil?

17:53.703 --> 17:56.646
Actually, I was hoping
there was a second one

17:56.646 --> 17:58.878
that I could
cover it with.

18:03.183 --> 18:06.886
I've been dreaming of this
since I was a little girl.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.259
This is exactly
how I pictured it.

18:09.259 --> 18:12.262
On an island filled with
bionic superhumans?

18:12.262 --> 18:14.624
You don't know what I dreamed.
You weren't there.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.728
Hear ye, hear ye.

18:18.728 --> 18:22.702
We are gathered here
to join Theresa Cherry Perry

18:22.702 --> 18:26.506
and Douglas Orville Davenport
in marriage.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.708
Orville?

18:28.708 --> 18:30.710
Given everything
that's happening right now,

18:30.710 --> 18:34.644
do you really think that
 that is gonna embarrass me?

18:34.644 --> 18:37.147
If anyone here
sees a reason why

18:37.147 --> 18:38.818
these two should not
be married,

18:38.818 --> 18:40.350
please raise your hand.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.895
Nothin'?
Nobody?

18:45.895 --> 18:48.398
No one here objects,
not a soul? Good.

18:48.398 --> 18:49.959
By the power
vested in me

18:49.959 --> 18:52.162
by some random site
on the internet,

18:52.162 --> 18:56.065
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

18:56.065 --> 18:58.308
- You may now kiss the--
- Cue the music.

18:59.969 --> 19:03.413
( weak applause )

19:04.814 --> 19:06.876
Hold on.

19:06.876 --> 19:09.319
There's still one
minor formality
to make this...

19:09.319 --> 19:13.122
beautiful arrangement
official.

19:13.122 --> 19:14.824
You have to sign
the marriage license.

19:14.824 --> 19:16.286
Of course.

19:18.027 --> 19:22.292
Congratulations. You're now
Douglas Orville Perry.

19:23.233 --> 19:25.835
- We did it!
- Ha!

19:25.835 --> 19:27.697
As your husband,

19:27.697 --> 19:30.200
I now own
half the island.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.642
You may think you own
half of what's mine,

19:32.642 --> 19:35.004
but in Perryland,
the lady takes it all.

19:35.004 --> 19:36.706
Read the charter.

19:36.706 --> 19:37.777
Come on, Dougie-poo.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.779
It's honeymoon time.

19:39.779 --> 19:43.152
Oh, my evil past has finally
caught up to me.

19:43.152 --> 19:45.815
Hold on there,
bridezilla.

19:45.815 --> 19:48.388
Joke's on you.
I switched documents.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.689
What are you
talking about?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.621
Oh, this isn't
a marriage license.

19:51.621 --> 19:53.022
You just signed a contract
that gives

19:53.022 --> 19:55.795
total ownership
of the island back to us.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.327
( all exclaiming )

19:57.327 --> 19:58.598
What? Give me that.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.773
Wait, so they're not
actually married?

20:05.204 --> 20:08.177
If those two can't make it,
what chance do any of us have?

20:10.109 --> 20:12.382
You may have taken
my island and my man,

20:12.382 --> 20:14.814
but you will never take
my laser fist!

20:14.814 --> 20:16.316
( screaming )

20:20.990 --> 20:24.254
And this is still
exactly how I pictured it.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.528
Thanks for nothing!

20:35.605 --> 20:38.708
Well, now that
zombie-pocalypse is over,

20:38.708 --> 20:40.570
I can finally use
the intelligence duplicator

20:40.570 --> 20:42.272
to make all the students
smart again.

20:42.272 --> 20:43.613
It's about time.

20:43.613 --> 20:45.915
Who, hold on.

20:45.915 --> 20:47.977
Did you ever think
maybe Bob doesn't wanna
be super intelligent?

20:47.977 --> 20:49.919
- Oh, I--
- Nobody cares, Bob.

20:51.781 --> 20:54.724
Look, just because
you can change someone
doesn't mean you should.

20:54.724 --> 20:57.287
I mean, Bob might not be
as smart as everyone,

20:57.287 --> 20:58.788
but he's Bob.

20:58.788 --> 21:00.960
That's why I love him.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.762
And Chase...

21:04.193 --> 21:06.065
you're Chase,

21:06.065 --> 21:08.267
and that's why...

21:08.267 --> 21:10.199
Well, I'll stop there.

21:10.199 --> 21:14.073
That might be
the smartest thing
he's ever said.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.606
Did you hit him with
the intelligence duplicator?

21:16.606 --> 21:18.748
You know, Adam's right.

21:18.748 --> 21:20.880
We should destroy it.

21:23.212 --> 21:24.984
Where'd it go?

21:24.984 --> 21:26.716
( loud chewing )

21:28.858 --> 21:32.191
Told you normal Bob
would do that, too.
