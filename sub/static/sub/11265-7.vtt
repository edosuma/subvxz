WEBVTT

00:01.511 --> 00:04.651
You have no idea who this person is.

00:04.661 --> 00:07.078
- No.
- Or what this is about.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.304
Mm, no.

00:08.314 --> 00:11.364
"Zissner, office, meeting, 10:00."

00:11.374 --> 00:13.657
And you have no idea what that means.

00:13.667 --> 00:16.413
I feel like I made that very clear.

00:16.423 --> 00:18.805
Unlike this cryptic idiocy!

00:18.838 --> 00:21.111
Why do you even bother to answer the phone?

00:21.121 --> 00:23.239
Because you scream at me when I don't!

00:23.249 --> 00:25.412
Volume! Jesus!

00:25.445 --> 00:28.549
My God, Lana, you look like hell.

00:28.582 --> 00:30.517
Like I've been saying for years.

00:30.551 --> 00:33.721
Woman, you do not want to
light this particular fuse.

00:33.753 --> 00:36.037
A.J. was up all night with the croup.

00:36.047 --> 00:37.190
Did you give her bourbon?

00:37.224 --> 00:39.260
You know, I was going
to, and then I realized

00:39.292 --> 00:40.494
that, no, I wasn't going to.

00:40.527 --> 00:42.062
Always worked for Sterling.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.565
And you're just gonna...

00:44.598 --> 00:47.234
- Yeah, too sleepy.
- What is this?

00:47.268 --> 00:49.571
"Zissner"? Wait, as in Don Zissner?

00:49.604 --> 00:51.005
She has no idea.

00:51.038 --> 00:53.508
Which, again, very clear on that.

00:53.541 --> 00:57.045
He's a huge producer. He makes those
massive, stupid, sharky blockbusters.

00:57.077 --> 01:01.036
Sharknoid, Sharknoid 2, Sharknoid
3 In 3-D, Sharknoid 4, Shark...

01:01.046 --> 01:04.185
- We get it!
- Let me finish. Sharknoid Five.

01:04.217 --> 01:06.720
Is that who we're meeting with?

01:06.753 --> 01:08.160
Maybe.

01:08.170 --> 01:11.391
Hm, "Zissner, office, meeting, 10:00."

01:11.425 --> 01:13.094
That's all Carol told you?

01:13.127 --> 01:15.363
Yes, we're to meet Zissner
in his office at 10:00.

01:15.396 --> 01:17.699
- But other than that...
- We have no idea.

01:17.732 --> 01:19.901
Or why she even bothers
to answer the phone.

01:19.934 --> 01:21.836
Well, otherwise Mother screams at her.

01:23.066 --> 01:24.230
- Good morning.
- Hi,

01:24.240 --> 01:25.606
Cyril Figgis, Figgis Agency.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.604
We have a 10:00 with Mr. Zissner?

01:27.614 --> 01:29.252
- Maybe.
- I'm sorry?

01:29.262 --> 01:30.377
I'm sorry?

01:30.410 --> 01:33.249
I'm sorry. Is this the Figgis Agency?

01:33.259 --> 01:36.550
- Maybe.
- Then I think I have a 10:00 appointment.

01:36.583 --> 01:37.985
I'm Barbie Zissner.

01:38.018 --> 01:39.319
Oh!

01:39.353 --> 01:41.488
Oh, please forgive me, Miss...

01:41.521 --> 01:45.325
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Zissner, of course, yes.

01:45.359 --> 01:47.060
Mrs. Donald Zissner.

01:47.093 --> 01:48.562
Yes.

01:48.595 --> 01:49.963
<i>Your 10:00 is here.</i>

01:49.997 --> 01:52.832
I know. Thank you.

01:52.842 --> 01:55.136
<i>You're welcome.</i>

01:55.169 --> 01:56.737
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

01:56.771 --> 01:59.673
First off, killer marketing campaign.

01:59.683 --> 02:00.808
Goddamn it.

02:00.841 --> 02:04.511
Second, you've each been given a
non-disclosure agreement to sign.

02:04.545 --> 02:07.515
If any of you repeat
anything said in this room,

02:07.547 --> 02:11.184
I will skull-rape you so
hard, legally speaking,

02:11.218 --> 02:13.087
that your
great-great-grandchildren

02:13.119 --> 02:15.022
will spend their short, miserable lives

02:15.056 --> 02:16.957
as indentured servants to mine.

02:16.991 --> 02:18.125
Is that clear?

02:18.135 --> 02:19.292
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

02:19.326 --> 02:20.795
Third...

02:20.827 --> 02:22.362
I'm not really sure how to put this,

02:22.396 --> 02:24.165
so I'll just go ahead and say it.

02:24.197 --> 02:27.601
I think my
husband is cheating on me.

02:27.635 --> 02:29.036
- That's so sad.
- Oh.

02:29.070 --> 02:31.105
I think my wife is cheating on me.

02:31.137 --> 02:32.439
No.

02:32.473 --> 02:34.975
And so I want to hire you.

02:35.009 --> 02:36.718
To catch her in the act.

02:36.728 --> 02:38.713
I'll need video confirmation, of course.

02:38.746 --> 02:41.381
So you want us to follow him and...

02:41.415 --> 02:43.117
No, not just follow her.

02:43.149 --> 02:45.118
More than that. Much more.

02:45.152 --> 02:46.939
There's just too much at stake here.

02:46.949 --> 02:49.457
I have to be a hundred percent sure.

02:49.490 --> 02:51.892
And so I want one of you...

02:51.926 --> 02:55.671
- to seduce my husband and tape it.
- To seduce my wife and tape it.

02:55.681 --> 02:58.966
Aw, man. Lousy timing.

02:58.998 --> 03:02.248
My bush looks like I'm
sitting on Jerry Garcia's face.

Synced and corrected by johnyd13
~ www.addic7ed.com ~

03:39.039 --> 03:41.576
Because A, it's super skeevy, and...

03:41.609 --> 03:44.911
And B, possibly extremely lucrative!

03:44.945 --> 03:47.849
She agreed to pay us $20,000.

03:47.881 --> 03:50.752
And Zissner's worth God
knows how many millions,

03:50.784 --> 03:53.887
so if we can wedge ourselves
into that divorce...

03:53.920 --> 03:55.389
And he tells two friends.

03:55.422 --> 03:57.291
And she tells two friends.

03:57.324 --> 04:00.051
And so on and so on and so on.

04:00.061 --> 04:02.398
I thought you said the
divorce business was shabby.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.698
If it's poor people.

04:03.730 --> 04:06.475
So what, you think you're
literally gonna pimp me out?

04:06.485 --> 04:08.705
- Who says she's pimping you?
- Why does she get to get pimped out?

04:08.715 --> 04:11.739
I'm sorry. Is there another option?

04:11.771 --> 04:14.474
- Uh, boosh?
- And-or kakow?

04:14.507 --> 04:16.439
Pam, please, this is serious.

04:16.449 --> 04:17.822
Uh, wha...

04:17.833 --> 04:19.107
I am serious.

04:19.117 --> 04:21.415
Cyril, come on. You can't do it.

04:21.447 --> 04:23.618
Zissner wants us to prove
his wife's cheating on him,

04:23.651 --> 04:27.191
not that she's capable of
aspirating her own vomit.

04:27.201 --> 04:28.588
So what, you're going to do it?

04:28.622 --> 04:32.259
Well, I mean, I think we should
put our best foot forward here.

04:32.292 --> 04:33.795
Or at least our best five inches.

04:33.828 --> 04:34.929
Hey-oh!

04:34.961 --> 04:36.596
Who are you, Wheeler and Woolsey?

04:36.629 --> 04:38.064
- Who?
- Typical.

04:38.098 --> 04:39.934
So you're just gonna cheat on Lana.

04:39.966 --> 04:43.003
Oh, right. Goddamn it.

04:43.037 --> 04:46.307
I mean, even if Archer did basically
cheat on me with Veronica Deane...

04:46.340 --> 04:47.607
- Oh, please.
- One kiss.

04:47.641 --> 04:49.309
I refuse to stoop to his level.

04:49.343 --> 04:51.444
Lana, it's $20,000.

04:51.478 --> 04:52.814
I don't care if it's...

04:52.846 --> 04:54.414
Okay, I almost said 20 million,

04:54.448 --> 04:55.983
but obviously I would bang him for that.

04:56.016 --> 04:57.985
Ah-ha! So you do have a price.

04:58.018 --> 05:01.823
Yes, duh, but it's not 20 grand,
Ron Measly, so you can count me out.

05:01.855 --> 05:04.291
Welp, guess I'm gonna need a bucket of ice

05:04.324 --> 05:05.692
and a roll of gaffer tape.

05:05.725 --> 05:07.595
- For?
- D-I-Y Brazilian.

05:07.627 --> 05:09.870
When it's this bushy, the
clippers just get stoved up.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.298
- Ew.
- Pam!

05:11.331 --> 05:14.093
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know
I was going to get called up

05:14.103 --> 05:16.970
- to the big show.
- Nobody's calling you anywhere.

05:17.004 --> 05:19.071
I don't know. I think
Pam's got a better chance

05:19.081 --> 05:22.042
of seducing Zissner than
Gluella DeVil over here.

05:22.076 --> 05:23.611
Are you insane?

05:23.643 --> 05:25.179
No, I'm dead serious.

05:25.211 --> 05:26.980
I'll bet you my share of the 20 grand

05:27.014 --> 05:29.783
that Ray can seduce
Barbie Zissner before you.

05:29.816 --> 05:31.619
What're you... I'm not in this!

05:31.651 --> 05:33.353
If we win, you get his share.

05:33.386 --> 05:35.857
- That's almost $7,000.
- I...

05:35.889 --> 05:39.471
- Where'd you get 7,000?
- I divided 20 by 3, Cyril.

05:39.481 --> 05:41.415
Come on, this is pretty basic stuff.

05:41.425 --> 05:44.564
Three. Tuh... what, we're just
not telling the women about this?

05:44.598 --> 05:45.665
Why would we?

05:45.699 --> 05:46.903
- Hm? Hm.
- Yeah, screw them.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.636
Ray, come on. Be a team player.

05:48.668 --> 05:50.337
We can drink you through this.

05:50.370 --> 05:53.841
Would you have sex with a man for $7,000?

05:53.874 --> 05:56.475
I would if it had a
negative impact on Cyril.

05:56.485 --> 05:57.978
Wha... You hate me so much

05:58.011 --> 06:00.180
that you would actually
have sex with a man.

06:00.213 --> 06:01.381
I would date him.

06:01.415 --> 06:03.184
And I wish y'all every happiness,

06:03.216 --> 06:05.185
but I am not sleeping
with that woman, so...

06:05.218 --> 06:06.895
- So then Krieger!
- What?

06:06.905 --> 06:08.389
My share against yours.

06:08.422 --> 06:11.892
I bet Krieger can seduce
Barbie Zissner before you.

06:11.925 --> 06:14.194
You are on!

06:14.228 --> 06:15.827
Yeah, I am all over that action.

06:15.837 --> 06:17.398
Ha! Then it's a bet.

06:17.430 --> 06:19.266
- I got I got Krieger...
- I got Cyril...

06:19.300 --> 06:21.067
I've got Pam. And you've got Cheryl.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.138
Oh, please, Carol
couldn't seduce a Spaniard.

06:24.148 --> 06:25.740
Me, on the other hand...

06:25.773 --> 06:28.276
Only if
Zissner's into archeology.

06:28.309 --> 06:31.379
You little... All right,
Lana, you have a bet.

06:31.412 --> 06:35.016
I'll take Carol, and we will
laugh all the way to the bank.

06:35.049 --> 06:37.285
- And we're not telling the men?
- Why would we?

06:37.317 --> 06:38.551
- Well, yeah.
- Mm-hm.

06:38.585 --> 06:40.254
Oh, man.

06:40.287 --> 06:42.890
I'm gonna seduce the dick off that dude.

06:43.958 --> 06:45.393
Oww!

06:45.425 --> 06:47.527
Yes, what mere mortal could resist

06:47.561 --> 06:50.431
that cornucopia of nature's treasures.

06:50.463 --> 06:51.766
Exactly.

06:51.799 --> 06:53.434
Ow!

07:01.948 --> 07:04.453
Okay, so if anybody asks,
it's Cyril's birthday,

07:04.463 --> 07:06.822
and he asked us to take
him to a strip club.

07:06.832 --> 07:10.303
They'll buy that. It's so
sad and pathetic and Cyril-y.

07:10.336 --> 07:13.240
Uh, first of all, I dated
Lana for three years.

07:13.272 --> 07:15.107
She knows when my birthday is.

07:15.140 --> 07:17.943
I think you wildly
overestimate that relationship.

07:17.976 --> 07:19.856
With who, Veronica Deane?

07:19.866 --> 07:22.649
With whom. And, no, not Veronica Deane,

07:22.681 --> 07:24.914
who, by the way, Lana, kissed me,

07:24.924 --> 07:26.944
and also when is Cyril's birthday?

07:26.954 --> 07:28.988
Uh, how should I know?

07:29.022 --> 07:31.577
Trick question. It's today.

07:31.587 --> 07:33.040
And we're taking him to a strip club

07:33.050 --> 07:35.327
because he is both sad and pathetic.

07:35.361 --> 07:36.596
- Typical.
- Oh, man.

07:36.628 --> 07:39.365
Give my regards to all the molestees.

07:39.399 --> 07:40.966
Wait. Where are you guys going?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.412
None of your collective beeswax.

07:44.337 --> 07:47.085
Wow, that was way easier
than I thought it would be.

07:47.095 --> 07:49.776
Although, I guess so is everything.

07:50.082 --> 07:51.329
Krieger?

07:51.339 --> 07:52.966
Krieger. Krieger!

07:52.976 --> 07:54.357
Yep! Yep, yep, yep!

07:54.367 --> 07:55.682
Hey, guys.

07:55.714 --> 07:57.716
Shut up and brush your
teeth, comb your beard,

07:57.750 --> 08:00.120
and get some cologne on those
balls. You're coming with us.

08:00.152 --> 08:02.154
Done, done, done, done,

08:02.188 --> 08:04.190
and where exactly are we going?

08:04.224 --> 08:05.692
Well, first to buy you some clothes.

08:05.724 --> 08:07.665
And then... wait. Where are we going?

08:07.675 --> 08:09.529
Uh, let's see. Zissner said she'd be

08:09.562 --> 08:11.798
at the "The Swindon Hotel for happy hour."

08:11.830 --> 08:14.200
The Swindon? Nice.
Sunset Lounge or main bar?

08:14.233 --> 08:16.869
Uh, let's see. It says here... "main bar."

08:16.902 --> 08:19.205
So, hey, should I get some new clothes?

08:19.238 --> 08:22.220
Cyril, the answer to that
question is almost always yes.

08:22.230 --> 08:26.079
You know, Thoreau said, "Beware of all
enterprises that require new clothes."

08:26.112 --> 08:29.482
Krieger, nobody gives a shit about
Doonesbury. Now, come on, chop-chop.

08:29.515 --> 08:31.551
Ooh, chop-chop what? What are we chopping?

08:31.584 --> 08:33.544
Nothing. You're going to have sex.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.754
With a... person?

08:35.787 --> 08:37.530
- What are you...
- I'm gonna double the bet.

08:37.539 --> 08:39.077
- What bet?
- No, shut up.

08:39.087 --> 08:41.390
I would think "person" was implied.

08:41.423 --> 08:43.625
Yeah, no, I just didn't
wanna get in that head space

08:43.659 --> 08:44.894
and then, you know...

08:44.927 --> 08:46.196
No, I don't.

08:46.229 --> 08:47.197
- Double it!
- No!

08:47.230 --> 08:48.765
What bet?

08:48.798 --> 08:51.028
Okay, if you can seduce this woman...

08:51.038 --> 08:52.139
- Whoo.
- Yeah.

08:52.149 --> 08:54.036
And if you seduce her before Cyril does,

08:54.069 --> 08:56.594
you get five, uh, hundred...

08:56.604 --> 08:57.874
- Whoo.
- Thousand.

08:57.907 --> 09:00.143
- Whoo-hoo...
- Goddamn it. Dollars.

09:00.175 --> 09:01.777
I'm in. I can use the money

09:01.811 --> 09:04.061
to finish my Voight-Kampff machine.

09:04.245 --> 09:06.216
Or... not that.

09:06.617 --> 09:07.763
Forget I said that.

09:07.773 --> 09:10.653
Now, remember, Carol. The
key here, as with most things,

09:10.686 --> 09:13.890
is confidence. Which
Pam's got by the shitload.

09:13.900 --> 09:16.625
For reasons known but to God.

09:16.659 --> 09:18.128
Well, a lot of it's the Brazilian.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.929
They really make you feel sexy.

09:20.962 --> 09:24.500
At least until the ingrown hairs
turn me back into Bumplestiltskin.

09:24.534 --> 09:26.635
- B-ugh.
- I want to double the bet.

09:26.668 --> 09:28.614
Deal.

09:28.624 --> 09:33.143
- Damn.
- Just damn or daaaaaaamn!

09:33.428 --> 09:35.125
Whichever is worse.

09:35.135 --> 09:36.612
Damn, Cyril!

09:36.645 --> 09:38.847
Really? You don't...

09:39.374 --> 09:42.918
- think it's too much?
- I... You know, I think it would be.

09:42.952 --> 09:44.347
- I wanna double the bet.
- No.

09:44.357 --> 09:47.156
- Give you five-to-two odds.
- No! Krieger, get out here!

09:48.323 --> 09:50.217
- Goddamn it.
- Five to one!

09:50.227 --> 09:52.928
Dude, take it! I feel amazing.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.764
And confidence is the key.

09:54.797 --> 09:56.798
And Thoreau was a idiot.

09:57.159 --> 09:59.968
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

10:00.001 --> 10:01.837
No, Lana dear, listen.

10:01.870 --> 10:04.540
All this nonsense about doubling the bet.

10:04.573 --> 10:06.322
What, are you trying to welsh on me?

10:06.332 --> 10:09.212
- Huh... Well, now who's a racist?
- That's not racist.

10:09.245 --> 10:11.346
- It is if you're black.
- There are black Welsh people.

10:11.380 --> 10:14.246
- Name one.
- Uh, Shirley Bassey.

10:14.256 --> 10:16.513
- Name 20 more.
- No, the bet stands.

10:16.523 --> 10:20.957
And that is just fine with us.

10:20.990 --> 10:22.677
Damn.

10:22.687 --> 10:24.526
I know. I look like a whore.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.295
As a matter of fact,

10:26.328 --> 10:28.298
I'm willing to double it again.

10:28.331 --> 10:29.332
Um...

10:29.365 --> 10:31.765
Psst. Lana, come here.

10:31.775 --> 10:33.523
Come here, come here, come here, come here.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.572
Take the bet. Double it.

10:35.605 --> 10:38.707
Is this mirror not working or...

10:38.740 --> 10:40.510
Don't be shitty. I'm in progress.

10:40.543 --> 10:43.313
And plus, Jerkleton, I've got this.

10:43.346 --> 10:45.515
Spanish Fly.

10:45.548 --> 10:47.701
- Right?
- Pam, that shit doesn't work.

10:47.711 --> 10:48.985
Yes, it does.

10:49.018 --> 10:51.414
We just need to mix it
with some mole's blood.

10:51.424 --> 10:55.091
So... hey, what were you saying
about un-doubling the bet?

10:55.124 --> 10:56.692
Not a word.

10:56.726 --> 10:58.300
I'm serious, Ray. I'm about to punch you

10:58.310 --> 10:59.561
in the face with your own fists.

10:59.595 --> 11:01.998
First of all, you are a
mean drunk on germicide.

11:02.030 --> 11:04.366
It's blue Curaçao, you dumb idiot.

11:04.399 --> 11:06.068
Giuseppe keeps it in the back for me.

11:06.101 --> 11:08.170
Well, then you're a mean
drunk on blue Curaçao.

11:08.203 --> 11:11.234
I know. I'm actually banned
for life from Willemstad.

11:11.244 --> 11:14.244
Well, their loss. Now, come on. Put
your money where your fat blue mouth is.

11:14.276 --> 11:16.245
No, we're not doubling the bet.

11:16.279 --> 11:18.047
Come on. Don't you have faith in your man?

11:18.080 --> 11:19.349
Shoo, shoo!

11:19.381 --> 11:21.638
- Shoo, shoo, shoo! Shoo!
- Krieger!

11:21.648 --> 11:24.228
Shoo. Sh...

11:24.238 --> 11:25.355
I do not, no.

11:25.388 --> 11:27.429
Well, I've got faith in mine.

11:27.439 --> 11:29.643
Cause he is lookin' muy Rico Suave.

11:29.653 --> 11:32.427
Oh, well, gracias, amigo.

11:32.461 --> 11:36.032
Pff. More like Rico... not Suave.

11:36.064 --> 11:37.866
He said like a drunk jealous bitch.

11:37.899 --> 11:40.269
I'm not drunk! Wait, I am drunk.

11:40.303 --> 11:42.404
Cyril, you need any last-minute pointers?

11:42.438 --> 11:44.640
Ha! From you?

11:44.673 --> 11:46.542
The quarry may change but never the hunt!

11:46.574 --> 11:47.943
Hm, let's see.

11:47.976 --> 11:50.480
Oh, here's one. When
do I start negging her?

11:50.513 --> 11:54.584
"Negging"? Jesus Christ,
what grade are you in?

11:54.616 --> 11:58.654
Why don't you try putting some
Spanish Fly in her Brass Monkey?

11:58.688 --> 12:01.223
I think you
mix it with mole's blood.

12:01.256 --> 12:04.032
What're you... Where the hell
would you get mole's blood?

12:04.042 --> 12:05.434
Why, you need some?

12:05.444 --> 12:08.664
I need you to get your
big, bushy Bob Ross-ian head

12:08.697 --> 12:11.233
out of your ass, because
we've got a bet to win!

12:11.266 --> 12:15.438
And also, Giuseppe, I'm pretty sure
this is actually germicide, so...

12:15.471 --> 12:16.505
- What?
- Damn it, Archer.

12:16.539 --> 12:18.282
Yeah, that's... not great.

12:18.292 --> 12:21.678
Although, silver lining... bet I could
eat a whole big bowl of germs right now.

12:23.178 --> 12:25.581
Okay, let's go seduce this broad.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.618
Okay, let's go put some stank on it.

12:28.650 --> 12:31.620
Yes, I suppose this is as attractive

12:31.654 --> 12:33.255
as these two are ever going to be.

12:33.289 --> 12:35.936
- Unless we can find some mole's blood.
- No.

12:35.946 --> 12:37.327
- I have some.
- No!

12:37.360 --> 12:39.861
Oh, wait. This is vole's blood.

12:39.894 --> 12:42.636
I swear to God, you people.

12:42.646 --> 12:44.048
Taxi!

12:45.835 --> 12:49.105
Man,
I don't feel so great.

12:49.138 --> 12:51.507
Wonder if that's got anything to do

12:51.539 --> 12:53.416
with all that germicide you drank.

12:53.426 --> 12:55.944
Honestly, even if it had been Curaçao,

12:55.977 --> 12:57.979
I bet I'd still be a little oogy.

12:58.013 --> 12:59.949
No shit, you killed all your good flora.

12:59.981 --> 13:01.855
Hey, Spirou, where's the main bar?

13:01.865 --> 13:05.302
- Through the lobby to the left, sir.
- Thanks. Cyril, tip the young man.

13:05.312 --> 13:06.889
Oh, uh...

13:07.312 --> 13:10.360
Darn. I must've left
my wallet in my other clothes.

13:10.393 --> 13:12.128
- Uh...
- Typical.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.662
Here you go.

13:13.968 --> 13:16.899
Here you go, ladies. Hotel Swindon.

13:16.932 --> 13:19.369
Well, it's about time. Pay the man, Lana.

13:19.401 --> 13:22.871
Uh, I don't... uh, Pam?
I'll get the next one.

13:22.904 --> 13:25.207
Yeah, me too. Pony up, neckbone.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.559
Yoo-hoo, bellboy, which
way is the Sunset Lounge?

13:28.569 --> 13:30.107
Fair's 18.50, Miss.

13:30.117 --> 13:34.844
Okay, so, do you have change for 10...
let me finish... drams of vole's blood?

13:43.274 --> 13:45.317
Did he say to the right or to the left?

13:45.327 --> 13:46.627
- I thought he said right.
- He said to the left.

13:46.637 --> 13:50.033
- Thanks, Lois and Clark.
- It's Lewis and... oh.

13:50.043 --> 13:52.852
- See what I did there?
- What are you doing here?

13:54.354 --> 13:57.624
I'm gonna assume it's some
sort of costume birthday party?

13:57.634 --> 13:58.945
It's not my birthday!

13:58.955 --> 14:02.095
Then why's Krieger dressed up
like Evil Nazi Bob Ross Knievel?

14:02.128 --> 14:03.964
Why are you dressed like a prostitute?

14:03.996 --> 14:07.120
- It's for work!
- Wait, what are you all doing here?

14:07.130 --> 14:09.099
- Lunch?
- It's 5:30.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.748
- Dunch?
- Mother, what the hell is going on?

14:11.758 --> 14:13.359
I could ask you the same thing.

14:13.392 --> 14:14.860
- Oh, my God.
- What's he doing here?

14:14.893 --> 14:16.707
- Mr. Zissner?
- What's the deal here, Figgis?

14:16.717 --> 14:18.564
Wait, you two know each other?

14:18.574 --> 14:20.366
Uh, well, um...

14:20.400 --> 14:21.802
- Donny?
- Babe.

14:21.835 --> 14:23.086
- Wait.
- Uh, what? - What the...

14:23.096 --> 14:24.342
Why aren't you in the bar?

14:24.352 --> 14:26.682
I heard all this commotion out here.

14:26.692 --> 14:28.666
Why aren't you in the Sunset Lounge?

14:28.676 --> 14:32.747
Okay, obviously there's been some
sort of misunderstanding here, so...

14:32.780 --> 14:34.983
- Wait a minute.
- I think the best thing at this point

14:35.016 --> 14:37.051
is for everybody to...

14:37.085 --> 14:40.021
- un-clump.
- Did he hire you to bang her?

14:40.054 --> 14:41.423
- Uh...
- Hey, no!

14:41.455 --> 14:43.490
Before you answer that, remember you signed

14:43.523 --> 14:46.664
an extremely punitive
non-disclosure agreement.

14:46.674 --> 14:49.404
Yes. And also tape it.

14:49.414 --> 14:51.599
- Goddamn it!
- Shut up.

14:51.633 --> 14:53.200
And you were just going to do it?

14:53.234 --> 14:55.103
Not me. Cyril or Krieger.

14:55.136 --> 14:56.937
Ah! As if.

14:56.947 --> 14:59.817
- I mean, maybe blondie here.
- As if.

14:59.827 --> 15:02.167
Wait, but she hired us to seduce him.

15:02.177 --> 15:04.397
- And tape it.
- Shut up!

15:04.407 --> 15:06.417
Why would anyone do such a thing?

15:06.427 --> 15:08.717
It's your basic
cuckold fetish porn.

15:08.749 --> 15:10.402
How is that basic?

15:10.412 --> 15:12.687
In fact, I bet they do these
hookups in the same hotel

15:12.719 --> 15:14.589
at the same time so they
know the other one's doing it.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.024
Stop talking!

15:16.056 --> 15:17.758
And they each go upstairs with whoever,

15:17.791 --> 15:19.360
make a tape, and then go home

15:19.393 --> 15:21.087
and watch them together.

15:21.097 --> 15:23.575
Goddamn, I wish I was married!

15:23.585 --> 15:26.401
You
are all so frickin' sued!

15:26.434 --> 15:28.870
Shut up. And you were just gonna do it?

15:28.902 --> 15:31.060
- Not me!
- Wha... Mother?

15:31.070 --> 15:33.775
No, you idiot! One of those two.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.042
Who?

15:35.075 --> 15:36.710
Scarrah Fawcett and Baby Huey?

15:36.743 --> 15:38.245
Hey!
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

15:38.278 --> 15:39.580
Uh-uh.

15:39.613 --> 15:41.248
Bitch, you better 'pologize!

15:41.282 --> 15:43.652
Or what?

15:43.685 --> 15:44.953
Or this!

15:52.292 --> 15:53.327
Aah!

15:54.695 --> 15:56.598
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Sha! Sha!

16:01.201 --> 16:03.137
Szhee!

16:03.171 --> 16:05.105
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

16:13.348 --> 16:16.685
Come on, Lurch. Let's see
what's in that belly of yours!

16:16.718 --> 16:18.953
Shoo! Shoo! Sha! Sha!

16:21.055 --> 16:22.959
Enter Sandman.

16:22.969 --> 16:24.325
My eyes!

16:24.359 --> 16:25.960
Ow!

16:25.993 --> 16:27.695
Ow...

16:27.729 --> 16:30.331
Damn it. What is this, a chair factory?

16:30.364 --> 16:32.866
Get everybody down here!

16:32.900 --> 16:35.516
Baby! Baby, come on. We
gotta get out of here.

16:35.526 --> 16:37.711
- Okay, honey.
- Paparazzi. Paparazzi!

16:37.721 --> 16:40.175
- Aah! Damn!
- Shoo! Shoo! Sha! Sha!

16:46.019 --> 16:48.487
I gotta say,

16:48.497 --> 16:50.904
I think that went about
as well as it could have.

16:50.914 --> 16:52.053
Tell that to Carol!

16:52.085 --> 16:53.808
- Whoa, gross.
- Oh, God.

16:53.818 --> 16:55.623
Oh, this is vole's blood.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.693
- I hope.
- That's disgusting.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.162
Well, whom or whatever's blood it is,

17:01.172 --> 17:03.333
I vote we go rinse it off with a mojito.

17:03.343 --> 17:05.366
Come on, we can still catch...

17:05.400 --> 17:09.903
Uh... happy hour.

17:20.142 --> 17:24.031
Seriously, worst happy hour
ever. And I hate to do it,

17:24.041 --> 17:27.502
but I have to trash you
guys in my online review.

17:27.593 --> 17:31.087
Thanks. And also sorry, but I don't
feel like you've earned a tip, so...

17:31.121 --> 17:33.002
Will you shut up and come on!

17:33.012 --> 17:35.781
Wasn't six hours in this hell hole enough?

17:35.815 --> 17:39.052
That bail is paid, and now I
would like to go home, please!

17:39.085 --> 17:42.370
Okay! I'm not the one taking all
night to give me back my stuff!

17:42.380 --> 17:43.744
No, you're just the one

17:43.754 --> 17:45.826
who started the brawl
that got us all arrested.

17:45.858 --> 17:47.747
First of all, that brawl started

17:47.757 --> 17:49.403
when Carol messed up the messages.

17:49.413 --> 17:50.911
No, I did not.

17:50.921 --> 17:52.899
Zissner, meeting, office, 10:00?

17:52.933 --> 17:55.184
What, were you being intentionally vague?

17:55.194 --> 17:57.303
- Eh, duh.
- What?

17:57.337 --> 17:58.906
I wanted to see what would happen.

17:58.938 --> 18:00.806
- Oh, goddamn.
- Really?

18:00.839 --> 18:02.675
Well, excellent work.

18:02.709 --> 18:04.745
You just ruined our entrée

18:04.778 --> 18:07.548
into the world of high-priced
Hollywood divorces!

18:07.580 --> 18:09.982
Which, come on, we're better than that.

18:10.015 --> 18:13.686
Shooooo, wahhhhh...

18:13.720 --> 18:15.989
- Are we?
- I am.

18:16.021 --> 18:18.712
I drank a whole big thing of germicide.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.199
- Shooo...
- What?

18:20.209 --> 18:22.020
That would've killed a normal man.

18:22.030 --> 18:25.731
Shooo,
whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo...
