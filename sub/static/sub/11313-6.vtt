WEBVTT

00:10.290 --> 00:12.230
He can do
physical stuff.

00:12.265 --> 00:13.795
He can touch you.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.660
Your mom was murdered
right here in this room?

00:15.670 --> 00:16.820
Yes, she was.

00:16.855 --> 00:17.935
She's pissed.

00:17.970 --> 00:21.355
She feels
like she's being tortured.

00:21.390 --> 00:24.715
A shadow person
started to charge at me.

00:24.750 --> 00:28.040
I think that a living person
was attacked.

00:28.050 --> 00:29.840
He shoots himself
in the mouth,

00:29.850 --> 00:32.310
and the bullet comes out
the top of his head.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.450
What is this thing?

00:33.485 --> 00:34.980
A demon.

00:34.990 --> 00:37.720
He doesn't want anybody here.

00:37.755 --> 00:39.957
I just hear death.

00:39.992 --> 00:42.160
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.195 --> 00:43.755
God.

00:43.790 --> 00:45.790
It's like,
"I'm going to get you."

00:45.800 --> 00:46.865
I see dead people.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.160
Her face was all demonic.

00:48.170 --> 00:49.865
I speak to dead people.

00:49.900 --> 00:52.700
He's like, "You think you can
stop me? Because you can't."

00:52.735 --> 00:54.065
And they speak to me.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.605
What is he trying to do?
Kill them.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.770
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:58.780 --> 01:00.780
Something happened.
Bam, bam, bam!

01:00.815 --> 01:02.340
I rely on my partner.

01:02.350 --> 01:03.875
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.910 --> 01:05.650
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:05.685 --> 01:07.115
Am I seeing
what I think I'm seeing?

01:07.150 --> 01:10.350
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.385 --> 01:11.485
They're everywhere.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.885
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.990
This guy's got the markings
of a serial killer.

01:15.025 --> 01:17.755
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.790 --> 01:19.830
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.865 --> 01:21.025
...until the very end...

01:21.060 --> 01:22.695
Is this dead guy
doing that to her?

01:22.730 --> 01:24.600
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

01:24.635 --> 01:26.665
That's it.

01:26.700 --> 01:27.935
...or time to get out.

01:27.970 --> 01:32.210
Somebody's gonna die
over there soon, yeah.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

01:46.960 --> 01:48.720
I'm in the small town
of Lake City, Florida,

01:48.730 --> 01:51.430
about an hour west
of Jacksonville.

01:51.465 --> 01:52.590
I got a call from a woman

01:52.600 --> 01:54.460
who was crying hysterically
on the phone.

01:54.495 --> 01:56.865
She says her house
is a war zone.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.230
She says, if things
don't change soon,

01:59.240 --> 02:01.375
someone's gonna
get hurt really bad.

02:01.410 --> 02:03.510
I'm hoping Amy and I
can help her out,

02:03.545 --> 02:05.110
'cause she sounded terrible.

02:10.710 --> 02:13.210
Before Amy arrives,
I need to make sure

02:13.220 --> 02:15.680
any photographs,
religious symbols,

02:15.690 --> 02:18.150
or personal items
that may influence her findings

02:18.160 --> 02:20.820
are removed
or hidden from sight.

02:20.855 --> 02:22.025
When I'm finished,

02:22.060 --> 02:23.930
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

02:37.040 --> 02:40.510
There's, like,
a lot of pain here.

02:40.545 --> 02:43.980
This one guy in particular
who died,

02:44.015 --> 02:47.215
he's not, like, human.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.615
He's, tall, really tall.

02:50.650 --> 02:54.520
Um, but he is kind of
like an orange, red --

02:54.555 --> 02:57.260
like, that kind of a color.

02:57.295 --> 02:59.790
He...thinks, like,

02:59.800 --> 03:03.600
humans, I guess,
are interesting,

03:03.635 --> 03:05.770
and he likes to imitate them.

03:07.540 --> 03:10.275
So when he is imitating them,

03:10.310 --> 03:14.710
he takes on
a more human, form.

03:14.745 --> 03:16.280
He's not a good thing.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.690
So, Regina,
I'm glad I'm here now,

03:27.725 --> 03:29.020
'cause when we spoke
on the phone,

03:29.030 --> 03:30.995
you sounded
pretty desperate.

03:31.030 --> 03:33.595
My nieces, my cousins' kids,
my nephews --

03:33.630 --> 03:37.000
they won't come over no more
'cause they're terrified.

03:37.035 --> 03:39.217
Well, do you have
children of your own?

03:39.252 --> 03:41.400
No, me and my husband
can't have kids.

03:41.435 --> 03:42.740
It breaks my heart.

03:43.970 --> 03:46.170
All right, so, give me
a list of what's happening.

03:46.180 --> 03:50.730
Knocking and banging
and things move around.

03:50.765 --> 03:55.280
Um, we've seen
shadow people -- apparitions.

03:55.290 --> 03:58.840
Um, and lately, it's been
getting kind of violent

03:58.875 --> 04:02.390
with people getting scratched,
pushed, shoved.

04:02.425 --> 04:03.990
Okay, so, when did you guys
move in?

04:04.025 --> 04:07.230
Um, we moved in,
um, 2005.

04:10.630 --> 04:13.640
And we moved in to take care
of my husband's grandmother.

04:13.675 --> 04:15.000
Well, what can you
tell me about it?

04:15.010 --> 04:17.695
His mother was killed.

04:17.730 --> 04:20.380
Your husband's mother?

04:20.415 --> 04:21.897
In this house?

04:21.932 --> 04:23.821
Who did it?

04:23.856 --> 04:25.710
Her brother.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.450
My husband will tell
you more about it.

04:27.485 --> 04:28.780
Okay.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.450
Now, you said
you moved here to take care

04:30.485 --> 04:32.102
of your husband's
grandmother.

04:32.137 --> 04:33.720
Did she witness
the murder?

04:33.755 --> 04:35.020
Yes.

04:35.030 --> 04:36.190
Okay, is she still alive?

04:36.225 --> 04:37.395
No.

04:37.430 --> 04:39.730
Okay, when did she pass?

04:39.765 --> 04:41.165
Um, 2008.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.395
Here's a picture
of Dorothy.

04:43.430 --> 04:45.000
And how old was she
when she passed?

04:45.035 --> 04:46.530
Um, 92.

04:46.540 --> 04:49.390
Where did she die?
And what'd she die of?

04:49.425 --> 04:52.240
Um, natural causes.
And here, at the house.

04:52.275 --> 04:54.205
She had dementia.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.350
It was a hard thing
'cause that's the first time

04:57.385 --> 05:00.950
I've ever really
watched somebody die.

05:00.985 --> 05:02.185
Okay.

05:02.220 --> 05:05.620
Have you done anything
to try to fix things here?

05:05.655 --> 05:07.837
I have saged the house.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.020
I have salted the yard.

05:10.030 --> 05:12.430
There was always something
about the side yard

05:12.465 --> 05:14.095
I've never liked.

05:14.130 --> 05:15.615
Why don't you
like it outside?

05:15.650 --> 05:17.065
One morning --
it was early --

05:17.100 --> 05:19.630
I went outside the door
and looked up.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.435
And there was, like, a --

05:21.470 --> 05:25.205
a shadow person
about 6 foot...

05:25.240 --> 05:27.475
maybe bigger --
started to charge at me.

05:27.510 --> 05:31.030
And I'm like, "Whoa.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

05:31.065 --> 05:34.550
There's something out there,
something <i> bad.</i>

05:39.260 --> 05:41.925
Someone put a barrier up.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.555
It's keeping
this tall thing out.

05:44.590 --> 05:48.160
He can't come in here
and do anything.

05:48.195 --> 05:49.960
And he's angry about it.

05:53.370 --> 05:55.270
Is it just focused
on this house?

05:55.305 --> 05:56.905
Yes.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.170
It looks at it
as, like, a challenge.

06:00.180 --> 06:02.645
He says
that he will find a way.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.080
He <i> will.</i>
He <i> will</i> find a way.

06:10.290 --> 06:12.650
Okay, what are you
experiencing in here?

06:12.660 --> 06:14.120
Um, when I was
sitting on the couch,

06:14.155 --> 06:15.820
it was sitting behind me.
Okay.

06:15.830 --> 06:18.230
And I seen, like, a light
out of the corner of my eye.

06:18.265 --> 06:20.812
I looked at it.
And it came down.

06:20.847 --> 06:23.360
But it had
Uncle Jack's face on it

06:23.370 --> 06:24.820
as it disappeared
in the chair.

06:24.855 --> 06:26.235
All right.
Who's Uncle Jack?

06:26.270 --> 06:28.340
My husband's uncle
who was involved

06:28.375 --> 06:29.592
with the murder-suicide.

06:29.627 --> 06:31.468
Were you on any medication?

06:31.503 --> 06:33.275
No.
Nothing like that.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.780
That woulda freaked me out
a little bit.

06:35.815 --> 06:37.040
Okay.
Anything else?

06:37.050 --> 06:39.750
Last night, I was out there
in the laundry room.

06:39.785 --> 06:41.980
Something came up
and hit me in my back.

06:41.990 --> 06:44.350
It felt like somebody had,
like, a knife or a screwdriver,

06:44.385 --> 06:46.185
and he went down into it.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.990
Getting assaulted, basically
is what's going on.
Yes.

06:49.025 --> 06:50.255
Anything else going on?

06:50.290 --> 06:52.930
Little shadow person,
about yea big.

06:52.965 --> 06:53.730
He runs around.

06:53.765 --> 06:54.965
All right.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.530
So, this -- the shadow,
how big are we talking?

06:57.565 --> 06:59.530
Um, about that big.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.170
Well, what about
the dog casting a shadow

07:01.205 --> 07:02.302
as it's running around?

07:02.337 --> 07:03.400
When I see it,
usually,

07:03.410 --> 07:06.370
I can see my two dogs
in here with me.

07:11.980 --> 07:17.990
He can run...after them...
and follow them.

07:20.290 --> 07:21.460
You mean
when they leave here?

07:21.495 --> 07:22.455
Yes.

07:22.490 --> 07:26.425
I see him,
like, in a car.

07:26.460 --> 07:29.530
He says he gets really little,
when he does that.

07:29.565 --> 07:32.600
Can you describe what it looks
like when it's small?

07:32.635 --> 07:34.735
It looks like a troll.

07:34.770 --> 07:37.570
But the thing is, like,
it's really muscular.

07:37.605 --> 07:39.305
Do the living see it?

07:39.340 --> 07:44.380
I see a living person
looking out...the door

07:44.415 --> 07:47.367
and seeing it,
like, quick outside.

07:47.402 --> 07:51.011
And I -- you know,
I would be concerned

07:51.046 --> 07:54.620
about him trying
to injure them in the car.

07:54.655 --> 07:56.972
What is this thing?

07:57.007 --> 07:59.290
Some kind of demon.

08:04.730 --> 08:06.330
So, what's going on
in here?

08:06.340 --> 08:08.500
I constantly feel
like I'm being watched.

08:08.510 --> 08:09.800
But it's coming
from the outside,

08:09.810 --> 08:11.540
like something's
out the window,

08:11.575 --> 08:13.170
looking inward.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.140
Just...I feel
like somebody's out there,

08:15.175 --> 08:17.975
standing there,
watching me.

08:18.010 --> 08:19.450
All right.
Anything else happening in here?

08:19.485 --> 08:21.282
Yeah.
I was scratched in here.

08:21.317 --> 08:23.080
Here's the pictures
of them.

08:23.090 --> 08:25.990
One's on my chest
and on my lower stomach.

08:28.190 --> 08:30.090
That's pretty bad scratches.
These are pretty deep.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.095
Yeah.

08:31.130 --> 08:32.395
You sure the dog
didn't do this?

08:32.429 --> 08:33.659
Dogs aren't
allowed in my bed.

08:33.695 --> 08:35.395
So there's no way.

08:35.429 --> 08:36.695
So how the hell are you
sleeping at night

08:36.730 --> 08:38.200
knowing that, you know,
this could happen to you?

08:38.235 --> 08:39.630
I have
a lot of nightmares.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.870
Now, describe
the nightmares to me.

08:40.905 --> 08:42.100
What are we
talking about?

08:42.110 --> 08:44.010
Bad things happening
to my husband.

08:44.044 --> 08:45.640
Sometimes, they're violent.

08:54.020 --> 08:57.185
There's a lot of energy
in this house.

08:57.220 --> 09:01.020
That's why the dead are
so attracted to this place.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.760
There's a military officer.

09:11.730 --> 09:15.400
He's like...

09:15.410 --> 09:17.000
"Stand down.

09:17.010 --> 09:18.670
Stand down."

09:20.940 --> 09:23.275
And I feel sick.
I feel sick.

09:23.310 --> 09:26.150
Like, I feel his fear,
like, shaking.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.915
He can bother the living.

09:29.950 --> 09:32.720
If he feels like people
are too much in his space,

09:32.755 --> 09:34.485
he wigs out.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.720
He can do physical stuff.

09:36.730 --> 09:39.330
He can touch them, like...

09:39.365 --> 09:41.825
poking really hard.

09:41.860 --> 09:43.760
He can make you feel sick.

09:43.770 --> 09:45.535
He can touch you.

09:45.570 --> 09:47.540
He's like, "You don't want
to see when I get angry."

09:48.870 --> 09:50.170
Bad.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.030
So, John, I know this is not
easy to talk about.

10:11.270 --> 10:13.240
But your mom was murdered
right here in this room.

10:13.275 --> 10:14.370
Yes, she was.

10:15.940 --> 10:19.080
It happened right here.
Her chair was sitting here.

10:19.115 --> 10:21.575
Assassinated her.

10:21.610 --> 10:24.815
He killed himself
20 minutes later.

10:24.850 --> 10:28.020
The bullet hole's still up
in the ceiling right there.

10:28.055 --> 10:29.185
Wow.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.185
Now, what about
your grandmother? Where was she?

10:31.220 --> 10:34.320
She was sitting over there
in the corner in her chair.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.890
And when it happened,
she got up and ran outside.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.295
This is my mom, Becky,

10:39.330 --> 10:41.735
and my Grandma Dorothy
and my Uncle Jack.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.830
And this is the uncle that --
that did this thing?

10:43.840 --> 10:44.930
Yes, sir.

10:44.940 --> 10:46.570
How old was your mom
when she passed?

10:46.605 --> 10:48.375
59.

10:48.410 --> 10:49.405
What kind of woman
was she?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.370
She was a nurse --
the head nurse.

10:51.380 --> 10:54.680
She didn't get her way...
there'd be hell to pay.

10:54.715 --> 10:56.845
She was very difficult
to be around.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.715
Sounds like you guys
had a tough relationship.
Yes.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.550
So, John, any indication
as to why your uncle snapped?

11:02.585 --> 11:04.787
He was...

11:04.822 --> 11:06.955
a military vet.

11:06.990 --> 11:09.825
I think he had PTSD.

11:09.860 --> 11:12.625
He was...real crazy.

11:12.660 --> 11:14.300
Okay, so this man
was a troubled guy?

11:14.335 --> 11:15.595
Yes.

11:15.630 --> 11:18.670
You find it hard staying here
knowing this happened here?

11:18.705 --> 11:20.100
Yes.

11:20.110 --> 11:22.110
Do you ever think maybe
you should leave this place

11:22.145 --> 11:24.370
because of what happened?

11:24.380 --> 11:26.540
Yes,
but it's financial reasons.

11:26.550 --> 11:27.875
We can't.

11:27.910 --> 11:31.750
Do you think...any one
of those people are here?

11:31.785 --> 11:33.015
I feel my ma.

11:33.050 --> 11:34.800
And I s--
I hear my grandma.

11:34.835 --> 11:36.550
What about your Uncle Jack?

11:36.560 --> 11:38.440
I think he's here, too.

11:38.475 --> 11:40.320
I just feel his presence.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.090
Okay.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.300
I'm seeing
the military guy again.

11:49.335 --> 11:53.600
He's tough and very,
territorial.

11:53.610 --> 11:54.900
I think he lived here.

11:54.910 --> 11:58.410
I feel like he had a lot
to do with this house.

11:58.445 --> 12:03.097
Like, he's like,
"Get the **** out."

12:03.132 --> 12:07.750
He's got issues.
He's got mega issues.

12:09.090 --> 12:12.690
It is <i> terrible</i> back here.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.800
Have you had
any experiences?

12:18.835 --> 12:19.795
Yes.

12:19.830 --> 12:21.465
Okay.
Tell me what happened.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.770
I was standing in the middle
of the living room one evening.

12:23.805 --> 12:24.765
Okay.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.140
And it felt
like something shoved me

12:27.175 --> 12:29.527
and on my lower part
of my leg.

12:29.562 --> 12:31.401
And I went forward
into the window.

12:31.436 --> 12:33.240
And you're sure
you didn't trip?

12:33.250 --> 12:35.800
I didn't trip.
I was just standing there.

12:35.835 --> 12:38.350
You're lucky
you didn't cut an artery.

12:46.830 --> 12:52.800
Something very bad...
happened here.

12:52.835 --> 12:54.065
You know what?

12:54.100 --> 12:56.930
I think that a living person
was attacked in here,

12:56.940 --> 12:58.330
like, bad.

13:00.070 --> 13:04.170
I wanna say this is that dude --
the angry military guy.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.175
Think I hear glass breaking.

13:07.210 --> 13:09.780
And I'm feeling it,
like, on me.

13:09.815 --> 13:11.545
I'm, like, falling down.

13:11.580 --> 13:14.515
And there's,
like, glass everywhere.

13:14.550 --> 13:17.450
Like, I'm being pushed.
I can't breathe.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.655
They end up on the floor.

13:19.690 --> 13:23.060
This angry man,
he doesn't want anybody here.

13:27.530 --> 13:30.130
Why'd you bring me
out here?

13:30.140 --> 13:31.905
I...have a feeling

13:31.940 --> 13:34.070
of an ominous presence
in the woods.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.410
Are you feeling it
right now?

13:35.445 --> 13:36.335
Yes. I --

13:36.370 --> 13:37.705
What --
what are you feeling?

13:37.740 --> 13:42.080
Something's watching me...
over in the woods.

13:42.115 --> 13:43.447
It's looking at me
right now.

13:43.482 --> 13:44.780
Where's it looking
at you from?

13:44.815 --> 13:46.220
It's over there.

13:47.850 --> 13:48.955
But you can't see it.

13:48.990 --> 13:51.450
I can't see it.
But I feel it.

13:51.460 --> 13:52.860
All right.
Anything else?

13:52.895 --> 13:54.055
Banging.

13:54.090 --> 13:55.355
Okay.
What kind of banging?

13:55.390 --> 13:57.245
Like somebody knocking
on the door?
Yeah.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.100
Like,
cabinets opening and closing.

13:59.135 --> 14:00.795
I was in the kitchen
one time.

14:00.830 --> 14:02.780
And, there was a dish
on the sink.

14:02.815 --> 14:04.730
It fell off the counter,
onto the floor.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.035
It broke my toe.

14:06.070 --> 14:08.200
And so what makes you think
that's paranormal?

14:08.210 --> 14:09.840
Nobody touched it.
I didn't touch it.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.170
Think it was pushed.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.975
It's just devious.

14:13.010 --> 14:14.740
I don't know what it is.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.780
There's a woman.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.280
She has an accent.

14:21.290 --> 14:24.475
I feel like
this is <i> really</i> recent.

14:24.510 --> 14:27.660
She says that
if she would not have died,

14:27.695 --> 14:30.012
none of this would be going on.

14:30.047 --> 14:32.295
I'm gonna say
that she lived here.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.300
She was cooking
and cleaning all the time.

14:34.335 --> 14:37.000
She's slamming,
slamming, slamming,

14:37.035 --> 14:39.635
banging, banging, banging.

14:39.670 --> 14:43.070
She says she keeps
trying to leave.

14:43.105 --> 14:45.710
But she says someone keeps --

14:45.745 --> 14:46.840
living person --

14:46.850 --> 14:50.610
a living person
keeps pulling her back,

14:50.620 --> 14:54.250
keeps calling her back.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.540
This is a living female
doing this to her.

15:00.575 --> 15:03.760
She's sleeping.
Living lady's sleeping.

15:03.795 --> 15:06.195
She goes into her dream.

15:06.230 --> 15:08.900
And she gives
the living woman nightmares.

15:08.935 --> 15:09.865
She's pissed.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.640
She feels
like she's being tortured.

15:12.675 --> 15:15.100
She says that they know her,

15:15.110 --> 15:16.375
that they know her.

15:16.410 --> 15:17.610
They know she's here.

15:17.645 --> 15:19.062
They know she's here.

15:19.097 --> 15:20.445
They know she's here.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.145
"Why won't they let me go?

15:22.180 --> 15:23.810
Why won't they let me go?

15:23.820 --> 15:26.120
They know I'm here.

15:26.155 --> 15:27.180
Let me go.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.890
Let me go."

15:42.230 --> 15:43.395
Well, obviously,
the first thing

15:43.430 --> 15:45.500
I'm gonna look into
is this murder-suicide.

15:45.535 --> 15:46.865
Now, John gave me a lot

15:46.900 --> 15:50.110
of good information about
why his uncle might've snapped.

15:50.145 --> 15:53.575
But I wanna know exactly
what happened that day.

15:53.610 --> 15:56.050
I'm heading over to meet with
a Jacksonville medical examiner

15:56.085 --> 15:59.150
who's gonna take me through
the crime second by second.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.785
The murder takes place
September 19, 2005.

16:06.820 --> 16:09.555
Can you take me through that,
exactly what happened?

16:09.590 --> 16:14.330
Apparently, the sister, Becky,
is sitting on the recliner.

16:14.365 --> 16:16.865
Jack comes up behind her

16:16.900 --> 16:20.705
and shoots her one time
in the back of her head.

16:20.740 --> 16:24.510
And she probably turns
to see what happened.

16:24.545 --> 16:26.280
And then,
she takes a second shot

16:26.315 --> 16:29.375
to her left temple area.

16:29.410 --> 16:32.215
Based on the crime scene
photographs,

16:32.250 --> 16:35.170
it doesn't seem
like she moved anywhere.

16:35.205 --> 16:38.090
She just died right there
in the recliner.

16:41.860 --> 16:43.490
The woman
who is being trapped here

16:43.525 --> 16:45.625
won't talk about her death.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.200
She's, like,
really trying to block me

16:47.235 --> 16:48.860
from getting how she died.

16:48.870 --> 16:50.550
She said...

16:50.585 --> 16:52.230
Let's just say,

16:52.240 --> 16:55.570
like, her death was
a freak accident.

16:55.605 --> 16:57.672
Um, she was young.

16:57.707 --> 16:59.740
She was only, 52.

16:59.775 --> 17:01.327
It's wicked bad.

17:01.362 --> 17:02.880
She wants to leave.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.020
All right,
so she basically didn't even

17:06.055 --> 17:07.079
know what hit her?

17:07.115 --> 17:08.185
Probably not.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.349
Well, Jack --
how does he kill himself?

17:10.385 --> 17:12.585
He shoots himself
in the mouth.

17:12.619 --> 17:15.190
And the bullet
comes out the top of his head,

17:15.224 --> 17:17.025
like you see right here.

17:17.060 --> 17:21.030
And then, he falls back
and dies in that hallway.

17:21.065 --> 17:21.895
Okay, so, Doctor,

17:21.930 --> 17:24.099
I'm assuming
a toxicology was done?

17:24.135 --> 17:25.030
Yes.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.175
He had
multiple medications.

17:27.210 --> 17:29.275
They were not
illegal drugs

17:29.310 --> 17:31.970
or drugs of abuse
that were in his system.

17:31.980 --> 17:34.040
Do we know
what he was taking drugs for?

17:34.050 --> 17:35.640
He suffered from PTSD,

17:35.650 --> 17:39.010
because he was
in the Vietnam War.

17:39.020 --> 17:41.320
Apparently, he was
a helicopter pilot

17:41.355 --> 17:43.015
and was shot down twice.

17:43.050 --> 17:45.050
Okay.
In addition,
he was depressed.

17:45.060 --> 17:47.425
He suffered from
Parkinson's disease.

17:47.460 --> 17:50.930
He had a heart condition --
apparently, had a heart attack

17:50.965 --> 17:54.030
prior to him coming to live
with his sister,

17:54.065 --> 17:55.530
who was gonna
take care of him.

17:55.565 --> 17:56.765
And do we have any idea

17:56.800 --> 17:59.270
<i>why</i> he might have wanted
to kill his sister?

17:59.305 --> 18:02.940
His mother had signed over
the deed of the house

18:02.975 --> 18:04.405
to his sister.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.080
And this right here
is the deed.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.450
So he got cut out
altogether.

18:10.485 --> 18:11.815
That's correct.

18:11.850 --> 18:16.050
He had, um, what we interpret
to be a suicide note.

18:16.085 --> 18:17.722
This is very brief.

18:17.757 --> 18:19.458
He says he's depressed.

18:19.493 --> 18:21.125
"Becky is mean to us."

18:21.160 --> 18:23.560
And then, he says
he didn't want any CPR.

18:23.595 --> 18:25.595
He didn't want
any resuscitation.

18:25.630 --> 18:28.260
So he wanted to make sure
that he would die.

18:32.970 --> 18:36.170
I feel like he had a lot
to do with this house

18:36.205 --> 18:38.505
'cause he's like,

18:38.540 --> 18:41.140
"Get the **** out."

18:41.150 --> 18:43.580
The angry dead man
who attacks the living

18:43.615 --> 18:46.050
is following me everywhere I go.

18:46.085 --> 18:47.715
He's furious that I'm here.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.320
But I'm not leaving
until I find out

18:49.355 --> 18:51.207
who he was in life.

18:51.242 --> 18:53.025
He had a heart attack.

18:53.060 --> 18:56.060
Feel like he started dying here
or died here.

18:56.095 --> 18:58.260
Feel like he was in wars.

18:58.295 --> 19:00.595
He fought in wars.

19:00.630 --> 19:03.570
And he had injuries
or something.

19:03.605 --> 19:07.440
His legs feel...so weird...

19:09.510 --> 19:13.745
...like, burning,
like, they're on fire.

19:13.780 --> 19:17.980
He is angry, angry,
angry, angry, angry.

19:23.850 --> 19:25.155
If you need us
to investigate

19:25.190 --> 19:27.055
unexplained activity
in your home,

19:27.090 --> 19:29.440
go to the "Dead Files" page
at travelchannel.com.

19:29.475 --> 19:31.790
Click on "Help Me, Dead Files!"
to submit your story.

19:31.800 --> 19:32.760
And we'll help if we can.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.090
So far, I've got clients
being physically assaulted

19:43.125 --> 19:45.527
in a house where
a murder-suicide took place.

19:45.562 --> 19:47.930
But I need to see
if there's anything else

19:47.965 --> 19:49.930
that's gonna help
my investigation.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.085
Reading two old
newspaper articles,

19:54.120 --> 19:55.835
I find one of
the original owners

19:55.870 --> 19:58.170
of my clients' property
was a sheriff.

20:00.010 --> 20:02.605
Turns out a local
Syrian couple was murdered.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.040
And he was caught right in
the middle of the scandal.

20:05.050 --> 20:07.110
So, I'm heading over to meet
with a local professor

20:07.145 --> 20:08.345
who says he's got information

20:08.380 --> 20:09.850
that will definitely
help my case.

20:17.060 --> 20:18.560
The sheriff that lived
on my clients' property,

20:18.595 --> 20:19.755
what can you
tell me about him?

20:19.790 --> 20:23.160
Sheriff Wiley "Babe" Douglass,
born in 1885.

20:23.195 --> 20:26.062
He became chief of police
in the city in 1920.

20:26.097 --> 20:28.930
He must have been very popular,
very charismatic

20:28.940 --> 20:31.840
because he ran
for sheriff and won.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.975
This is him
in his uniform

20:34.010 --> 20:36.245
shortly after
winning that election.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.330
What kind of sheriff
was he, though?

20:38.365 --> 20:40.380
I mean,
what are we talking about?

20:40.415 --> 20:42.715
Well, he was corrupt.

20:42.750 --> 20:45.950
Sheriff Douglass was accused
of bootlegging,

20:45.985 --> 20:48.055
running gambling
operations.

20:48.090 --> 20:50.560
And he was also accused
of selling young women

20:50.595 --> 20:52.290
into prostitution.

20:52.325 --> 20:53.455
Geez.

20:53.490 --> 20:54.990
Why exactly does he come onto
my clients' property?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.395
Do we know that?

20:56.430 --> 20:59.930
Well, Steve, he purchases
your clients' property in 1928.

20:59.965 --> 21:01.200
All right.
So let's get to the murders.

21:01.235 --> 21:02.435
What exactly happened?

21:02.470 --> 21:05.140
The Romey family,
they're a successful,

21:05.175 --> 21:07.492
Syrian family,
immigrants.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.775
They own
a small produce store.

21:09.810 --> 21:13.310
The Romeys' son, Esau,
is involved in an auto accident.

21:13.345 --> 21:16.145
And the mother, Fannie Romey,
doesn't like the way

21:16.180 --> 21:19.920
that the city chief of police
handled the investigation.

21:19.955 --> 21:22.960
And so she contacts
the chief of police.

21:22.995 --> 21:24.225
She calls him a liar.

21:24.260 --> 21:25.525
Back then,
you didn't call

21:25.560 --> 21:29.290
the chief of police
in any Florida city a liar.

21:29.300 --> 21:31.535
Okay.
So what happens next?

21:31.570 --> 21:33.735
Well, Steve,
on May 17, 1929,

21:33.770 --> 21:38.735
the chief of police goes to
the Romeys' store,

21:38.770 --> 21:41.840
with two of his men and also
one of Sheriff Douglass' men.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.075
Okay.

21:43.110 --> 21:45.180
But Douglass is not at the scene
when this all goes down.

21:45.215 --> 21:46.245
That's correct.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.180
All right, so when they show up,
what happens?

21:48.215 --> 21:49.867
There's
a huge altercation.

21:49.902 --> 21:51.485
They actually take
Mr. Romey,

21:51.520 --> 21:53.215
and they actually
pistol-whip him.

21:53.250 --> 21:56.305
And he's knocked unconscious.
He's on the ground.

21:56.340 --> 21:59.360
At that point, Mrs. Romey
comes into the store.

21:59.395 --> 22:00.725
She panics.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.500
She grabs a pistol the family
has kept as shopkeepers.

22:03.535 --> 22:06.317
And she actually
shoots the chief,

22:06.352 --> 22:09.065
wounds him,
not seriously.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.040
Then the police return fire.
She's killed.

22:11.075 --> 22:12.400
And at that time,

22:12.410 --> 22:15.670
the police didn't know this,
but she actually was pregnant.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.395
Geez.
All right.

22:17.430 --> 22:19.075
And so at that point,

22:19.110 --> 22:22.910
the police pull her husband,
Mr. Romey,

22:22.920 --> 22:24.380
Nola Romey,
out of the store.

22:24.390 --> 22:27.290
They pull the son, Esau,
out of the store, as well.

22:27.325 --> 22:31.055
They actually bring them
to separate jails.

22:31.090 --> 22:35.290
Later that evening, a mob
comes to the city jail.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.295
They abduct Mr. Romey.

22:37.330 --> 22:39.365
They take him
out of the jail.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.465
They shoot him 13 times,
murder him.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.670
These were some articles
I found on the case.

22:47.070 --> 22:48.240
Even though he wasn't
at either one

22:48.275 --> 22:50.275
of these crime scenes,

22:50.310 --> 22:52.845
his culpability is --
is pretty high.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.080
And, got away
with, basically, murder.

22:55.115 --> 22:57.245
So after all is said and done,
is,

22:57.280 --> 22:59.720
Babe still on my clients'
property at this point?

22:59.755 --> 23:01.987
He is on
your clients' property

23:02.022 --> 23:04.185
until the day he dies
in 1947.

23:04.220 --> 23:06.655
And at that point,
he is 61 years old.

23:06.690 --> 23:09.090
He goes out in his car.
He's driving.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.960
He has a heart attack
and dies.

23:10.995 --> 23:11.960
Okay.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.970
I'm seeing
that red-orange thing again.

23:19.005 --> 23:21.305
He's, like, really racist,

23:21.340 --> 23:24.680
which is weird
'cause he's, like, not human.

23:24.715 --> 23:27.317
Who is it racist towards?

23:27.352 --> 23:29.920
I think really everybody.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.320
This thing,
he gloats about how,

23:38.330 --> 23:40.925
when he first came here,

23:40.960 --> 23:46.130
he was able to influence
and manipulate men.

23:46.165 --> 23:49.200
He would, like, do ****
to people.

23:50.740 --> 23:54.870
Like, cause them to turn
against each other, death,

23:54.880 --> 23:58.240
fighting and --
and all this kind of bad ****

23:58.250 --> 24:01.165
mostly people
killing other people.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.080
But he had
a great success rate.

24:07.350 --> 24:09.760
You know, one other thing caught
my attention in research --

24:09.795 --> 24:11.555
A woman who used to live
on the property

24:11.590 --> 24:14.225
died in a fire
right on Regina and John's land.

24:14.260 --> 24:16.825
I'm heading over to meet
with a local genealogist

24:16.860 --> 24:20.030
who says that tragedy could
have been easily prevented.

24:24.470 --> 24:25.605
Why'd you bring me here?

24:25.640 --> 24:27.870
This house is very similar
to the house

24:27.880 --> 24:30.110
that Louisa Smith Markham
lived in

24:30.145 --> 24:32.045
when she died
from the fire.

24:32.080 --> 24:33.580
What about the fire?
What happened?

24:33.615 --> 24:36.545
So in 1886,
Louisa, um,

24:36.580 --> 24:39.420
was taking care of the youngest
child, who was Elton.

24:39.455 --> 24:42.820
He was severely ill,
had, a real bad cold.

24:42.855 --> 24:44.720
So she bundled him up
and was --

24:44.730 --> 24:48.030
was sitting at the rocking chair
in front of the fire.

24:48.065 --> 24:51.900
Well, her nightgown
caught on fire.

24:51.935 --> 24:55.030
And as that occurred,

24:55.040 --> 24:56.770
the first instinct
of a mother, of course,

24:56.805 --> 24:57.987
is to save the child.

24:58.022 --> 24:59.135
Right.
Which she did.

24:59.170 --> 25:01.540
She got Elton
away from her.

25:01.575 --> 25:02.905
And by that time,

25:02.940 --> 25:06.745
she was completely engulfed
in flames, screaming.

25:06.780 --> 25:08.980
The house is very small.
Everybody would have seen it.

25:09.015 --> 25:10.085
It was so tragic

25:10.120 --> 25:12.920
because the children
would have seen her die.

25:12.955 --> 25:14.550
How old was she
when she died?

25:14.560 --> 25:16.450
She was 32.

25:16.460 --> 25:18.790
They're lucky that the whole
house didn't burn down.

25:18.825 --> 25:20.560
So she was a hero, really.
She saved the kid.

25:20.595 --> 25:21.360
Right.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.620
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.840
But what really concerned me
was the angry man

25:34.875 --> 25:37.827
attacking a living woman.

25:37.862 --> 25:40.780
He was an elderly man...

25:40.815 --> 25:43.385
pretty much bald.

25:43.420 --> 25:47.785
He has, like, a big belly.

25:47.820 --> 25:51.360
He was, like, pushing her head
into the wall.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.200
Was this what you saw?

25:59.235 --> 26:00.670
Yes.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.970
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:23.005 --> 26:24.235
we're ready
to reveal our findings

26:24.270 --> 26:28.140
to each other and our clients
for the first time.

26:28.150 --> 26:31.350
Amy, I want you to meet
Regina and her husband, John.

26:31.385 --> 26:34.515
Now, here's the issue --
Regina can't have children.

26:34.550 --> 26:38.585
So she's always filled the house
here with nieces and nephews.

26:38.620 --> 26:42.620
But the activity's gotten so
violent, they won't come over.

26:42.630 --> 26:44.390
And Regina doesn't even
know if it's safe

26:44.425 --> 26:46.225
for <i> them</i> to live here.

26:46.260 --> 26:48.830
So with that being said,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy

26:48.865 --> 26:50.770
and have her talk
about her walk.

26:53.600 --> 26:57.055
When I first arrived,

26:57.090 --> 27:00.475
I saw this being outside.

27:00.510 --> 27:04.615
And it's very
strange-looking, very tall.

27:04.650 --> 27:07.350
And it was also --
The color of it was interesting

27:07.385 --> 27:10.050
because it was kind of
like a reddish orange.

27:10.085 --> 27:14.955
This entity cannot get
into the house.

27:14.990 --> 27:17.630
To him, or to <i> it,</i>
something or somebody

27:17.665 --> 27:20.360
put up a barrier
around this property

27:20.395 --> 27:22.960
that is keeping him out.

27:22.970 --> 27:26.600
And because of that,
he's become very obsessed

27:26.635 --> 27:31.010
and fixated
on finding a way in.

27:31.045 --> 27:32.670
I saged the house.

27:32.680 --> 27:33.445
Okay.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.640
I salted the yard.

27:34.650 --> 27:36.410
Now, would that be
what's keeping him out?

27:36.445 --> 27:37.880
Yes, so, then,
more than likely,

27:37.915 --> 27:39.810
that's probably
the barrier

27:39.820 --> 27:43.355
that is keeping
him at bay.

27:43.390 --> 27:46.960
Even though he can't get
into the home,

27:46.995 --> 27:50.495
he can follow you
off of the property.

27:50.530 --> 27:55.700
I saw him get into a vehicle
with a living person.

27:55.735 --> 27:58.252
And when
he travels with you,

27:58.287 --> 28:00.228
he kind of
shrinks himself down

28:00.263 --> 28:02.166
so he has little arms,
little legs.

28:02.201 --> 28:04.405
But they're
very, like, strong.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.575
My concern
with him doing that is

28:06.610 --> 28:09.680
that he could cause you
to have a car accident.

28:09.715 --> 28:11.397
Well,
that's pretty interesting.

28:11.432 --> 28:13.656
We got a lot
to discuss now.

28:13.691 --> 28:15.880
Why don't you
tell Amy, Regina,

28:15.890 --> 28:19.050
about the shadow figure
that rushed you outside?

28:19.060 --> 28:22.660
There was a dark,
6- footish figure,

28:22.695 --> 28:23.912
black, black, black.

28:23.947 --> 28:25.130
And it charged at me.

28:25.165 --> 28:27.760
I'm like, "No.

28:27.795 --> 28:28.612
Go away."

28:29.430 --> 28:31.335
And it vanished.

28:31.370 --> 28:32.565
Now, Regina has a problem

28:32.600 --> 28:35.700
where she actually sleeps facing
the wall because...

28:35.710 --> 28:38.940
'Cause I feel
like I'm being watched.

28:38.975 --> 28:41.362
that could be him.

28:41.397 --> 28:43.715
He's ob-- obsessed.

28:43.750 --> 28:46.845
What's unusual
about <i> it</i> was

28:46.880 --> 28:50.785
that there was no recollection
of where he originated from.

28:50.820 --> 28:54.690
He stated that he's never
been human, <i> ever.</i>

28:57.290 --> 29:01.230
Even though he's never
been human, he's a racist.

29:01.265 --> 29:05.930
I'm not exactly certain
what it is.

29:05.940 --> 29:07.970
Um, but I would say,
you know,

29:08.005 --> 29:10.510
possibly a demon.

29:10.545 --> 29:11.370
Not good.

29:11.380 --> 29:12.770
I thought
it was evil.

29:12.780 --> 29:15.775
It was dark,
very dark.

29:15.810 --> 29:19.515
He was saying that he was able
to influence men

29:19.550 --> 29:23.220
to kill one another
and wants that to continue.

29:23.255 --> 29:24.620
But he's a racist
in general.

29:24.655 --> 29:26.250
Yes.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.420
A lot of what you're saying
makes me think about a man

29:28.430 --> 29:29.960
that actually lived
on your property

29:29.995 --> 29:32.390
from the '20s to the '40s.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.165
And his name was
Wiley Douglass.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.885
Everybody knew him
as "Babe."

29:35.920 --> 29:37.570
I actually got
a photo of him.

29:41.270 --> 29:42.900
He became
the county sheriff.

29:42.910 --> 29:45.640
And in 1929,
there was a Syrian family

29:45.675 --> 29:47.910
in town
known as the Romey family

29:47.945 --> 29:49.010
that ran a grocery store.

29:49.045 --> 29:51.015
It was real nearby.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.110
Now, the kid
of the family

29:52.120 --> 29:53.715
got into some kind
of a car accident.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.880
And they didn't like the way
the police handled it.

29:55.890 --> 29:58.950
So now, the mom, Fannie,
calls the chief of police

29:58.960 --> 30:01.120
to complain about
how they handled things.

30:01.155 --> 30:02.925
And she basically
called him a liar.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.630
Well, that didn't sit too well
with the guys.

30:04.665 --> 30:06.595
On May 17, 1929,

30:06.630 --> 30:08.260
the police chief,
two deputies

30:08.270 --> 30:10.770
and one of the sheriff's
deputies go to the store.

30:10.805 --> 30:12.630
So now, when the cops
entered the location,

30:12.640 --> 30:14.725
they pistol-whipped
the dad, Nola,

30:14.760 --> 30:16.775
and knocked him out
to the ground.

30:16.810 --> 30:19.540
The mom, Fannie, saw her husband
lying on the ground,

30:19.575 --> 30:20.745
thought he was dead.

30:20.780 --> 30:24.410
She picked up the gun
they kept in the store.

30:24.445 --> 30:26.410
And she
shot at the police.

30:26.420 --> 30:28.980
The police returned fire
and killed her.

30:28.990 --> 30:31.950
Now, this is
where it gets really screwed-up.

30:31.960 --> 30:35.875
The son and Nola were arrested
and brought to separate jails.

30:35.910 --> 30:39.790
Now get this -- That night,
a mob comes in, drags out Nola.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.595
And they shot him
13 times.

30:41.630 --> 30:44.600
And then they dumped his body
in some farm,

30:44.635 --> 30:46.670
wind up making
national news.

30:48.970 --> 30:51.570
So, now, could any of that,
what happened,

30:51.580 --> 30:54.380
had to do with
this red-orange guy outside?

30:54.415 --> 30:55.875
I do believe that,

30:55.910 --> 30:58.250
more than likely,
he influenced the cop

30:58.285 --> 31:00.515
to make poor decisions

31:00.550 --> 31:03.280
and cause
the deaths of others.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.125
So, what else
did you see?

31:08.160 --> 31:13.560
The next person that I met
was an interesting character.

31:13.595 --> 31:18.470
She, looks to be,
in her 50s.

31:18.505 --> 31:19.730
She's trying to leave.

31:19.740 --> 31:22.435
But a female here
keeps pulling her back.

31:22.470 --> 31:26.540
She said that she's getting
called directly by name.

31:26.575 --> 31:27.945
She said it's torturous,

31:27.980 --> 31:31.880
and she's furious about it
because she wants to leave.

31:31.915 --> 31:34.015
And she said to me

31:34.050 --> 31:38.090
that she goes
into the female's dreams

31:38.125 --> 31:40.085
and gives
this female nightmares.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.260
And she is talking to her
in the dreams,

31:42.295 --> 31:44.547
saying, "Let me go.

31:44.582 --> 31:46.765
Let me go.
Let me go."

31:46.800 --> 31:48.330
Well, you're the only female
that lives in the house.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.595
Right. I have
different bad dreams.

31:50.630 --> 31:52.630
I've <i> always</i>
had bad dreams, though.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.740
It's because you're,
more than likely, a medium.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.140
I've always been able
to hear things

32:01.175 --> 32:02.240
and see things

32:02.250 --> 32:05.310
and talk to things
that's not there.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.185
Yeah.
That makes sense.

32:07.220 --> 32:13.450
This dead woman, she also
is capable of slamming doors.

32:13.460 --> 32:16.325
She also has a fixation
in the kitchen.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.690
She showed me her slamming
the oven door and banging it.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.095
Now, John,

32:21.130 --> 32:23.130
you talked to me about noises
you heard in the kitchen, right?

32:23.165 --> 32:24.165
Yes.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.020
I get done with the dishes
and stuff.

32:26.055 --> 32:27.697
And I'll come back
out here and sit.

32:27.732 --> 32:29.340
And it sound
like somebody's in there,

32:29.375 --> 32:31.875
messing with
the dishes.

32:31.910 --> 32:33.640
You think that's
the woman doing that?

32:33.675 --> 32:35.140
I think so.

32:35.150 --> 32:36.440
Now, did you get any idea

32:36.450 --> 32:38.800
who this woman
might have been in life?

32:38.835 --> 32:41.115
I think she might have lived
in this house.

32:41.150 --> 32:43.450
She showed me images
of her cooking and cleaning

32:43.485 --> 32:44.602
all the time.

32:44.637 --> 32:45.685
And I sensed

32:45.720 --> 32:47.920
that someone in this house
knew about her dying.

32:49.430 --> 32:52.260
But she wouldn't talk to me
about her death at all.

32:52.295 --> 32:55.495
She kept blocking me
from seeing it.

32:55.530 --> 32:58.130
It's time we tell Amy
about the 1,000-pound gorilla

32:58.165 --> 32:59.765
in the room.

32:59.800 --> 33:02.705
John's mother, Becky,

33:02.740 --> 33:05.370
was murdered right over there,
in that corner.

33:05.380 --> 33:07.375
My goodness.

33:07.410 --> 33:09.840
To make things worse,

33:09.850 --> 33:13.080
the murderer was her brother,
John's Uncle Jack.

33:13.115 --> 33:15.515
Got it.

33:15.550 --> 33:18.785
Now, it happened
on September 19, 2005.

33:18.820 --> 33:21.460
That night, John's mom
was sitting in a chair

33:21.495 --> 33:23.055
right there

33:23.090 --> 33:26.995
when his Uncle Jack
came up this hallway.

33:27.030 --> 33:29.500
He put two bullets
in her head and killed her.

33:29.535 --> 33:31.735
He went halfway
down this hallway here,

33:31.770 --> 33:33.530
put the gun in his mouth,
and shot himself in the head

33:33.540 --> 33:34.840
and killed himself.

33:34.875 --> 33:36.335
My gosh.

33:36.370 --> 33:39.570
John's mom, she was 59 years old
at the time she died.

33:39.580 --> 33:43.380
Tell Amy about your mom,
what kind of woman she was.

33:43.415 --> 33:45.610
Very headstrong,

33:45.620 --> 33:47.950
where if it wasn't her way,
it was the highway.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.115
She'd get mad.

33:49.150 --> 33:52.690
At the snap of a finger,
she'd get mad at anything.

33:52.725 --> 33:54.820
Your uncle, was he ever
in the military?

33:54.855 --> 33:56.790
Yes, he was.
He was in the Army.

33:56.825 --> 33:58.142
He was
a helicopter pilot.

33:58.177 --> 33:59.460
And he was
shot down twice.

33:59.495 --> 34:00.962
My God.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.395
Okay. Got it.

34:02.430 --> 34:07.240
It sounds like you might have
seen Becky, John's mom.

34:07.275 --> 34:08.500
I have a picture of Becky.

34:08.510 --> 34:10.570
Okay. Yeah.
Let me see her.

34:10.605 --> 34:12.370
This is Becky.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.510
Yeah.
That's who I saw.

34:16.310 --> 34:18.715
I just don't want her
to be stuck here.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.920
Regina's accidentally
trapping her here, though.

34:20.955 --> 34:22.114
Yes.

34:22.150 --> 34:24.750
Which happens to a lot
of mediums that I meet.

34:24.784 --> 34:29.389
We like to have
dead people around us.

34:32.030 --> 34:34.245
So, then I met
another person.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.460
And it was
in the laundry room.

34:36.469 --> 34:42.699
When I walked in there, I felt
that a living person, female,

34:42.710 --> 34:48.630
was being violently attacked
by an older, deceased male.

34:48.665 --> 34:53.677
And to me, it was so intense,
it nearly killed this person.

34:53.712 --> 34:58.690
And I think the living person
was, pushed to the ground.

34:58.725 --> 35:03.077
I saw, like,
a pane of glass, um,

35:03.112 --> 35:07.395
break and shatter
onto my head.

35:07.430 --> 35:11.030
You know, everybody's getting
attacked here.

35:11.065 --> 35:14.067
I was standing,
looking out the window.

35:14.102 --> 35:17.070
And it felt
like something pushed me,

35:17.105 --> 35:18.275
the middle part
of my leg.

35:18.310 --> 35:21.140
And I fell forward
into the four panes of glass

35:21.175 --> 35:22.180
and broke the glass.

35:23.750 --> 35:25.980
He's lucky
he didn't cut his wrist open.

35:26.015 --> 35:27.245
Right.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.435
The other night,
I was in there,

35:29.470 --> 35:31.260
taking stuff
out of the dryer.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.050
And it felt
like somebody took

35:33.060 --> 35:37.290
either a very narrow knife
or a sharp blade...

35:38.190 --> 35:39.890
...and hit me
right back here.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.125
I felt it here.

35:41.160 --> 35:45.370
And I could feel it
<i>through</i> my skin.

35:45.405 --> 35:48.140
I had a sketch done
of the attack I saw.

35:50.310 --> 35:52.070
Should be interesting.

35:59.350 --> 36:01.550
I'm sorry, guys,
to even show you this.

36:07.490 --> 36:09.390
What are you thinking
when you see this?

36:09.425 --> 36:10.395
Jack.

36:10.430 --> 36:12.390
You're thinking
of your Uncle Jack?

36:12.400 --> 36:14.300
That's why
I turned away.

36:14.335 --> 36:15.365
I know you did.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.670
I don't need to see it.
I don't wanna see it.

36:17.705 --> 36:19.030
Can we take him
off the table?

36:19.040 --> 36:20.200
Yeah.
We'll take him off.

36:22.770 --> 36:23.935
There we go.

36:23.970 --> 36:26.170
Did you get anything
about this guy in life?

36:26.180 --> 36:26.970
Yes, I did.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.205
Let's talk about that

36:28.240 --> 36:29.745
before we go
jumping the gun.

36:29.780 --> 36:32.780
I got that this male
has extreme issues.

36:32.815 --> 36:34.745
He's incredibly angry.

36:34.780 --> 36:37.815
He was a very tough guy
in life.

36:37.850 --> 36:40.520
I got that he had a heart attack
at some point.

36:40.555 --> 36:43.190
I got that there was
something extremely wrong

36:43.225 --> 36:45.625
with his hips and legs.

36:45.660 --> 36:50.030
It hurt so freaking bad, it felt
like there was fire shooting

36:50.065 --> 36:52.700
through my legs
and into my hips.

36:52.735 --> 36:54.835
I got
that he was in a war

36:54.870 --> 36:57.610
and that he had suffered
injuries from that war.

36:57.645 --> 37:00.005
I got that he lived
and died here

37:00.040 --> 37:03.410
and that he was extremely
territorial about this house.

37:03.445 --> 37:06.312
He didn't want me
or anybody else here.

37:06.347 --> 37:09.180
Well, remember when I told you
about John's mom

37:09.190 --> 37:11.705
being killed
by her own brother?

37:11.740 --> 37:14.185
Okay.
Now, his name was Jack.

37:14.220 --> 37:17.075
He had a ton of issues,
both mental and physical.

37:17.110 --> 37:19.930
He was a helicopter pilot
in the Vietnam War.

37:19.965 --> 37:21.895
He was shot down twice.

37:21.930 --> 37:24.165
John believes
he suffered from PTSD.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.635
He was also
a <i> physical</i> wreck, though.

37:25.670 --> 37:28.100
He suffered from Parkinson's
and walked with a walker.

37:28.135 --> 37:29.735
Okay. Got it.

37:29.770 --> 37:30.875
Now, you mentioned before

37:30.910 --> 37:32.540
that you thought he had
a heart attack.

37:32.575 --> 37:33.570
Yes.

37:33.580 --> 37:34.745
He <i> did</i> have
a heart attack.

37:34.780 --> 37:37.550
And that's why John's mom
told him to move in here,

37:37.585 --> 37:39.610
so she could
take care of him.

37:39.620 --> 37:41.380
Now, the family thinks
there's a couple of reasons

37:41.415 --> 37:42.980
that he might have snapped.

37:42.990 --> 37:45.850
PTSD was the main reason.

37:45.860 --> 37:48.520
Through the fact
that their mother, Dorothy,

37:48.530 --> 37:52.490
was giving the house to Becky
and not to Jack.

37:52.500 --> 37:53.760
The territorial.

37:53.795 --> 37:54.925
Okay. Yeah.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.400
Do you have any doubts
that it could be him?

37:57.435 --> 37:58.217
No.

37:58.252 --> 37:58.965
Okay.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.265
Absolutely not.

38:00.300 --> 38:01.600
<i>Absolutely</i> not.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.490
Why is he being
so violent?

38:05.525 --> 38:07.940
He still wants
the house.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.880
He wants this for <i> him.</i>

38:12.620 --> 38:13.620
He coulda killed you.

38:13.655 --> 38:14.620
Yes, he could have.

38:37.590 --> 38:40.020
So, John,
your family lived here.

38:40.030 --> 38:41.155
They died here.

38:41.190 --> 38:43.500
And, apparently,
they're <i> still</i> here.

38:43.535 --> 38:45.195
Question is,
how can we move them on

38:45.230 --> 38:47.930
and take care of this thing
outside and to get your lives

38:47.965 --> 38:50.540
back to where there's children
in this house again?

38:50.575 --> 38:52.340
For that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

38:56.210 --> 38:57.975
I do think

38:58.010 --> 39:06.220
that thing outside is
a...agent of chaos.

39:06.255 --> 39:08.937
I think
he may have influenced

39:08.972 --> 39:11.620
what happened
in your family.

39:11.630 --> 39:14.825
That being said,
I'm very happy

39:14.860 --> 39:17.600
that you had the insight
and wherewithal

39:17.635 --> 39:19.160
to put down that salt.

39:19.170 --> 39:21.835
But this sucker
is tenacious.

39:21.870 --> 39:24.690
And he <i> will</i> get in
eventually.

39:24.725 --> 39:27.510
The first thing
that needs to be done

39:27.545 --> 39:29.705
is the removal
of the dead.

39:29.740 --> 39:33.240
A medium needs
to come into the home.

39:33.250 --> 39:36.950
On the first visit, the medium
needs to take care of the dead

39:36.985 --> 39:38.250
that you don't know.

39:38.285 --> 39:39.185
Okay.

39:39.220 --> 39:41.550
The second visit
is going to be

39:41.560 --> 39:44.975
to assist your mother,
um, to move on,

39:45.010 --> 39:48.390
and then,
once that's been completed,

39:48.400 --> 39:50.525
to move on
to your uncle.

39:50.560 --> 39:56.015
I need for you to recall
two really good memories

39:56.050 --> 40:01.470
about your uncle
and give those to the medium

40:01.505 --> 40:04.392
because it's only
through those memories

40:04.427 --> 40:07.280
that she'll be able
to reach <i> him.</i>

40:07.315 --> 40:09.750
Now, this is
very important.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.420
Okay.

40:18.430 --> 40:21.145
Hold on for a second.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.340
You seem
a little shocked.

40:31.910 --> 40:33.100
I think he is.

40:33.110 --> 40:34.640
- You okay to let go?
- Yes.

40:34.675 --> 40:35.705
Okay.

40:35.740 --> 40:38.480
'Cause you don't want them
to be here.

40:38.515 --> 40:40.080
You want her to...
Move on.

40:40.115 --> 40:41.715
Okay. Good.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.645
The entity is next.

40:43.680 --> 40:47.320
What needs to be done
with that situation

40:47.355 --> 40:50.425
is a priest
needs to come,

40:50.460 --> 40:54.310
needs to exorcise
the outside of your house

40:54.345 --> 40:58.125
and then do a blessing
outside of your home.

40:58.160 --> 41:04.100
It's going to keep
<i>all</i> negativity out forever.

41:04.135 --> 41:05.935
So, once all these steps
are done,

41:05.970 --> 41:08.725
they should feel a difference
in the house, right?

41:08.760 --> 41:11.480
Yeah. You'll feel
a substantial difference.

41:11.515 --> 41:13.380
This is
pretty freaking good news.

41:13.415 --> 41:14.815
Definitely.

41:14.850 --> 41:18.220
We can have the kids
to come over and play, you know?

41:19.290 --> 41:21.585
I'm glad you guys
called us in.

41:21.620 --> 41:24.090
You know, it broke my heart
listening to your story.

41:24.125 --> 41:26.560
But now you can go from
the house of basically the dead

41:26.595 --> 41:29.530
to the house of a happy,
living family.

41:29.565 --> 41:30.295
Yeah.

41:32.830 --> 41:35.400
I cannot imagine the pain
John and Regina feel

41:35.435 --> 41:37.540
knowing they have
deceased family members

41:37.575 --> 41:39.635
inside their home.

41:39.670 --> 41:41.510
But I believe
if they follow my advice,

41:41.545 --> 41:42.775
they can set them free

41:42.810 --> 41:45.240
and banish the demon outside
forever.
