- Not a dicky bird, mate.

I said, Mr. Farrow wants you
to join him.

40:35.022 --> 40:36.691
Do you know how much
this stuff costs?

40:36.891 --> 40:39.092
Less than a tin of dog food.
Can you believe that?

40:39.094 --> 40:40.663
Dogs eat better than we do.

40:41.161 --> 40:43.762
Mind you, I like dogs
and I don't begrudge

40:43.764 --> 40:46.734
- our canine friends a lovely gourmet dinner...
- Oi!

Yeah, why don't you go

when I'm ready to talk to him,
I will talk to him.

It's nice to see you.
It's been a long time.

- Not long enough.
- Aye, come on, mate.

Don't be like that.
You don't mean it.

I'm kind of at a loss for words.

I must say I never had you down
as one of the enlightened.

Oh!

42:28.168 --> 42:30.038
Enlightenment's a good word...

42:32.172 --> 42:35.208

who stitched me up.

a fucking enlightening day.

You're not still claiming
your innocence, are you?

42:40.915 --> 42:42.884
Innocence? No.

42:44.118 --> 42:45.585
I never said I was innocent.

Far from it, I'm no saint,

42:54.161 --> 42:56.628
that I should never have gone
down for those killings, right?

they're not, no.

Yeah and I know
she didn't take drugs.

Anyway, Richie wanted me
to set Farrow up

48:29.297 --> 48:31.166
with something that would
put him away forever.

48:31.464 --> 48:34.266
Scotland Yard had a mountain
of unsolved cases in those days

48:34.268 --> 48:36.705
and I pulled a good one,
a gangland slaying

48:36.904 --> 48:38.469
as they used to say
in the press.

48:38.471 --> 48:40.239
So, I cobbled together
enough evidence

48:40.241 --> 48:42.143
to put Farrow in a room
with a dead body.

48:42.442 --> 48:44.145
Things were so much easier
back then.

48:44.411 --> 48:45.547
So, what's on this tape?

48:46.781 --> 48:48.681
Some gobby, Geordie scrote,
Fenwick, I think his name was,

48:48.683 --> 48:50.752
was hauled in
for something else entirely

48:50.951 --> 48:52.717
and coughed up
to the whole bloody thing.

48:52.719 --> 48:54.587
If we press the charges
against him,

48:54.589 --> 48:56.357
our whole bloody case
would've collapsed.

48:56.556 --> 48:58.526
- So, you hid the confession tape.
- Yeah.

48:59.226 --> 49:01.293
- Well, where is it?
- It's safe.

49:01.295 --> 49:02.531
It's very simple.

49:02.964 --> 49:05.463
You meet Farrow.
You give him the tape.

49:05.465 --> 49:06.465
He'll call off his dogs.

49:06.467 --> 49:08.534
Then Richie can move on
with the escape plan.

49:08.536 --> 49:11.402
What's on that tape is enough
to get Farrow released,

49:11.404 --> 49:14.176
and with a golden fucking handshake
thrown in for good measure.

49:14.641 --> 49:16.377

I just want my father
to see my mother one last time.

So, Detective Inspector.
Here we are then.

to be in here.

You know you've got
a shit-eating grin?

01:04:41.935 --> 01:04:44.572
Well, grin big. 'Cause, you're gonna
be eating an awful lot of shit.

01:04:44.904 --> 01:04:48.508
Your associate is dead.
And Lizzy is alive and well.

01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:52.213
Bollocks. You're lying.

01:04:57.951 --> 01:04:59.153
He's not lying.

01:05:00.953 --> 01:05:02.619
I don't know about you two,

01:05:02.621 --> 01:05:05.426
but the novelty of this place
is fading fast.

01:05:06.259 --> 01:05:08.728
Yes, I'm beginning to think
we've outstayed our welcome.

01:05:12.933 --> 01:05:15.136
Sir, you need to see this.

01:05:16.268 --> 01:05:18.570
Fuck right off,
that fucking ain't mine.

01:05:18.572 --> 01:05:22.276
Perhaps, but this definitely
isn't yours.

Excuse me, ma'am?

01:05:41.994 --> 01:05:46.297
I was wondering if you'd
received my application?

01:05:46.299 --> 01:05:48.735
- Keep away from me.
- Keep your distance prisoner!

01:05:49.603 --> 01:05:54.441
I was wondering if you
received my application.

01:05:54.708 --> 01:05:56.343
I said, step away, now!

01:05:57.978 --> 01:05:59.180
Now!

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.616

about your father.

01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:39.386
Please, I really don't need
your sympathy.

01:06:40.753 --> 01:06:42.755
You really are just like him,
aren't you? [CHUCKLES]

01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:47.293
Yes, I am...
and I'm very proud to say so.

01:06:53.632 --> 01:06:55.768
My mother passed away
in the middle of the night.

01:06:57.569 --> 01:07:00.506
I wasn't going to tell my father
until he was safely away.

01:07:01.808 --> 01:07:05.779
Thought he might simply give up
and stay in prison.

01:07:07.013 --> 01:07:08.248
Well...

01:07:09.516 --> 01:07:13.420
- at least, they're together now.
- You think that's how it works?

01:07:14.386 --> 01:07:15.355
I don't know.

01:07:16.522 --> 01:07:19.559
I just think it's better
to hang on to hope, that's all.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.730
Well, if there is a heaven
and a hell,

01:07:25.331 --> 01:07:28.599
I think my dad would need Richie
to help him escape again.

[LIZZIE CHUCKLES]

01:07:32.672 --> 01:07:35.676
They won't release his body
until after the inquest.

01:07:37.377 --> 01:07:38.378
It could be weeks.

01:07:41.114 --> 01:07:43.681
They say they've got the man
who was responsible

01:07:43.683 --> 01:07:45.819
but we all know
who really did it.

01:07:47.554 --> 01:07:48.822
He is the devil.

01:07:50.790 --> 01:07:54.460
If he's not the devil,
he comes a close second.

01:07:57.831 --> 01:07:59.500
I'll leave you in peace.

01:08:07.574 --> 01:08:08.575

01:08:10.643 --> 01:08:12.446
I'll still help them escape.

01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:16.883
It's what my father
would have wanted.

01:08:19.451 --> 01:08:21.621
There's no point in us
both being heartbroken.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:30.563
The plan's still on.

01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:32.532
Jack, you in?

01:08:34.433 --> 01:08:35.502
Do you know why I'm here?

01:08:36.535 --> 01:08:38.571
Oh, okay, thanks.

01:08:39.138 --> 01:08:40.340
When?

01:08:40.572 --> 01:08:41.904
Well, it's got to be tonight.

01:08:41.907 --> 01:08:44.609

and the view from my room

- You fucking idiot.

- You don't know why I'm here, do you?
- You what?

01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:51.752
All you had to say
was you wanted to be with her.

01:08:52.451 --> 01:08:53.886
- I never said I didn't...
- No!

01:08:54.453 --> 01:08:56.490
Shut the fuck up
and listen to me for a change.

01:08:57.490 --> 01:08:58.826
You have an amazing woman here

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.928
who really, really likes you
for some unknown fucking reason.

01:09:02.928 --> 01:09:05.932
But the pair of you
are perfect together

01:09:06.732 --> 01:09:10.701
and these planets in alignment
moments don't come along that often.

01:09:10.703 --> 01:09:12.638
- But when they do...
- Jack...

01:09:13.538 --> 01:09:15.774
But when they do,
you grab a hold of them.

01:09:17.509 --> 01:09:20.712
You grab a hold of her
and you keep hold of her,

01:09:22.214 --> 01:09:23.417
because you never...

01:09:24.783 --> 01:09:27.487
Because, you never know
when she's going to be gone.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.859
So, Richie fucking Archer,
know this.

01:09:32.658 --> 01:09:34.826
I'm not putting my friend
from the lodge on the line

01:09:34.828 --> 01:09:36.796
because I want to assist
in a prison break.

01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:38.499

01:09:39.698 --> 01:09:40.701

01:09:44.437 --> 01:09:45.872

of her life.

Oh, drug dealers, right.
Fuck, no.

So, I take it you're not
a big fan of drugs then.

01:10:14.234 --> 01:10:16.600
No. That surprises you, yeah?

01:10:16.602 --> 01:10:18.802
Yeah. A lot of people think
that because you're young

01:10:18.804 --> 01:10:21.441
and in prison that you gotta
be banging to the narco but no.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.044
Now what's your problem with,
what's his name?

01:10:24.576 --> 01:10:26.446
- Raisin.
- Razor.

What's my problem with him?

very personal

about Razor

as I feel about
that puddle of puke,

I could probably help you settle
a few scores.

- Razor killed my little brother.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:10:45.865 --> 01:10:49.000
All right, well, yeah. You don't
really need to say sorry.

- Yes, I do. I know how you feel.
- Fuck you. No, you don't.

I know how you feel

My little brother got on
with the wrong lot.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:17.561
I was banged up in here so
I couldn't protect him out there

01:11:17.563 --> 01:11:18.898
and then, that one...

to do about it?

01:29:30.388 --> 01:29:32.122
out of your own pocket,
of course.

01:29:32.124 --> 01:29:33.726
[SCOFFS]
I certainly won't be doing that.

01:29:33.924 --> 01:29:35.594
Yes, Sir Edward, you will.

01:29:36.995 --> 01:29:38.129
Unless you want your name plastered
all over tomorrow's newspapers.

01:29:38.696 --> 01:29:40.165
I've done my homework, you see.

01:29:40.699 --> 01:29:43.033
I know all about
your fraudulent activities,

01:29:43.035 --> 01:29:45.902
- your insider trading.
- That's extortion.

01:29:45.904 --> 01:29:48.174
Actually, it's blackmail.

01:29:49.708 --> 01:29:52.074
Do you honestly think you're
going to get away with this?

01:29:52.076 --> 01:29:54.010
- You, you...
- I don't see why not,

01:29:54.012 --> 01:29:56.845
your industry's been
getting away with it for years.

01:29:56.847 --> 01:29:59.185
You see the only difference
between our two worlds

01:29:59.383 --> 01:30:02.051
is that nobody from banking
has ever been sent to prison.

01:30:02.053 --> 01:30:04.720
Oh, don't give me that speech
about how bankers

01:30:04.722 --> 01:30:05.757
have messed up the world.

01:30:06.825 --> 01:30:08.227
Without the banking industry,
the little people

01:30:08.427 --> 01:30:10.726
wouldn't be able
to afford bigger houses,

01:30:10.728 --> 01:30:15.034
- more expensive cars, luxury...
- You mean borrow to buy?

01:30:15.801 --> 01:30:18.134
And I can't believe you used
that expression,

01:30:18.136 --> 01:30:19.638
"little people."

01:30:19.905 --> 01:30:23.038
Those people
can't afford those things.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.908
Maybe, if they worked
a bit harder.

01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:27.880
- Can I get to work on him?
- Roy! Roy, back off.

01:30:28.446 --> 01:30:30.949
Go on, have a heart.
He's even older than we are.

01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:32.952
All right, Sir Edward,

01:30:34.119 --> 01:30:36.051
if that deal is not quite
tantalizing enough for you,

01:30:36.053 --> 01:30:37.922
let me offer you a, um...

01:30:39.057 --> 01:30:42.058
- what's it called, Roy?
- Um, deal incentive?

01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.893
No, no
that's not strong enough.

01:30:43.895 --> 01:30:45.031
"Sweetener."

01:30:45.763 --> 01:30:47.796
What could you possibly
promise me

01:30:47.798 --> 01:30:49.200
to make me change my mind?

01:30:49.834 --> 01:30:52.904
I think of it more as a threat,
old boy.

01:30:53.504 --> 01:30:55.206
The gold that was stolen.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.878
The gold that was sold
back to you.

01:31:00.478 --> 01:31:02.947
Who did it actually belong to?

01:31:04.081 --> 01:31:06.052
Yeah, them.

01:31:06.951 --> 01:31:08.917
And if there's one thing
you can be certain of

01:31:08.919 --> 01:31:13.892
with the Chinese, they are very,
very driven in business.

01:31:14.759 --> 01:31:18.263
And very protective
of their business.

01:31:19.164 --> 01:31:20.800
Do the right thing.

01:31:21.266 --> 01:31:25.004
It will gratify some people
and astonish the rest.

01:31:41.119 --> 01:31:43.322
You're right. That is magenta.

01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:46.792
Do you think he's going
to be all right?

01:31:47.959 --> 01:31:48.928
I hope so.

01:31:49.794 --> 01:31:51.797
It can take it out of you,
this job.

01:31:52.263 --> 01:31:54.863
He looks tired.
Needs an 'oliday.

01:31:54.865 --> 01:31:57.065
Hmm, well, no rest
for the wicked, eh?

01:31:57.067 --> 01:31:58.868
Who are you calling wicked?

01:31:58.870 --> 01:32:01.037
Anyway, it's you lot
that needs the 'oliday.

01:32:01.039 --> 01:32:03.573
- Retirement, in fact.
- Don't forget I...

01:32:03.575 --> 01:32:05.811
"I am the young gun
on the firm."

01:32:06.277 --> 01:32:07.279
Turn it in, Butch.

01:32:08.413 --> 01:32:11.113
You've been saying that for
the last fucking 30 years.

01:32:11.115 --> 01:32:13.917
You know I don't like that,
unless it's upside down.

01:32:13.919 --> 01:32:15.788
No, still don't like it.

01:32:16.288 --> 01:32:17.857
- Worth three million.
- Oh!

01:32:18.289 --> 01:32:21.025
Three million? I should have
been a fucking painter.

01:32:21.526 --> 01:32:23.560
- You could always steal it.
- Lizzy!

01:32:23.562 --> 01:32:25.231
- What?
- We've got principles.

01:32:25.931 --> 01:32:28.768
Never steal art.
Well, never steal bad art.

01:32:29.167 --> 01:32:30.833
So, what's next, Richie?

01:32:30.835 --> 01:32:32.268
Are we going to steal more gold?

01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:36.142
Maybe. But first I've got
to see a bloke about a bird.

01:32:36.907 --> 01:32:38.343
- What bird?
- Black...

01:32:40.212 --> 01:32:41.914
about that tall.

01:32:43.981 --> 01:32:44.984
ANTHONY: It's astonishing.

01:32:46.618 --> 01:32:48.788
I never thought I was going
to see it again.

01:32:50.088 --> 01:32:52.090
Thank you, Richie.

01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:55.058
Hey, thank you
for offering us sanctuary.

01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:57.226
You've been promising
to come here for so long

01:32:57.228 --> 01:32:59.328
I was starting
to take it personally.

01:32:59.330 --> 01:33:03.366
Yeah, well, my life did sort of run
away from me if you know what I mean.

01:33:03.368 --> 01:33:05.635
Looks like
it's treated you well, though.

01:33:05.637 --> 01:33:07.273
- Oh, yeah.
- [TAPS STOMACH]

01:33:08.005 --> 01:33:09.973
Good to see you again,
my friend.

01:33:09.975 --> 01:33:11.110
You too, my friend.

01:33:12.511 --> 01:33:15.347
And listen, we'll try not to be a
nuisance for too long, all right?

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:19.884
Actually, I was hoping
you'd stay a while. Help us out.

01:33:21.352 --> 01:33:24.222
We're having a little trouble
with the Taormina family.

01:33:24.655 --> 01:33:27.125
Oh, come on, we're a bit too old
for that sort of work.

01:33:27.625 --> 01:33:29.227
With age comes wisdom.

01:33:30.594 --> 01:33:32.164
We've tried our muscle on them,

01:33:32.364 --> 01:33:34.900
and they're not
getting the message.

01:33:35.633 --> 01:33:39.904
- What would you need?
- A more subtle, clever approach.

01:33:40.638 --> 01:33:43.241
Subtle, clever, yeah.
Well, we can do that, yeah.

01:33:44.241 --> 01:33:47.109
You know, why am I getting
the feeling this is an offer

01:33:47.111 --> 01:33:48.913
- I can't refuse?
- You can refuse.

01:33:51.115 --> 01:33:52.984
But I got a feeling...

01:33:53.985 --> 01:33:55.120
you wanna do it.
