00:00.187 --> 00:01.995
Previously on Shades of Blue.

00:02.020 --> 00:03.220
You don't have to stay for this.

00:03.255 --> 00:05.400
- You sold us out!
- Go find yourself a mirror!

00:06.310 --> 00:08.837
I followed you through fire,
Woz, and I never blinked.

00:08.897 --> 00:11.531
That woman had nothing
to do with you and me.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.434
That's the problem with
the dirty end of the field,

00:14.503 --> 00:15.769
a lot of collateral damage.

00:15.837 --> 00:17.757
<i>We gotta find Bianchi's trigger man</i>

00:17.782 --> 00:19.182
before he kills again.

00:19.207 --> 00:20.440
- Vincent Rossi.
- Bianchi's hit man.

00:20.509 --> 00:23.109
<i>Do you know how much fuel
you're throwing on the fire?</i>

00:23.178 --> 00:25.779
I will dismantle
any part of your life I need to

00:25.847 --> 00:27.213
to get what I want.

00:27.282 --> 00:29.316
You' lost control.

00:30.619 --> 00:33.286
You should make your husband
take you someplace warm

00:33.355 --> 00:35.388
before the weather takes a brutal turn.

00:35.457 --> 00:37.524
<i>Harlee, keep your head on a swivel.</i>

00:37.593 --> 00:39.459
<i>The music's still playing.</i>

00:39.528 --> 00:42.629
One of us is talking,
our fearless leader,

00:42.698 --> 00:47.801
a man so obsessed
with loyalty and obedience,

00:47.869 --> 00:50.403
is working with the FBI.

<i>I saw you meeting with the Feds,</i>

01:00.382 --> 01:02.482
<i>the same agent who picked me up
after the heist.</i>

01:02.551 --> 01:04.184
<i>I followed you.</i>

01:04.251 --> 01:06.753
Lieutenant Wozniak is the rat.

01:06.822 --> 01:10.159
- It's not true.
- Harlee, don't.

01:10.926 --> 01:13.693
Wozniak isn't the informant.

01:13.762 --> 01:15.362
I am.

All Woz was trying to do was help me.

01:28.443 --> 01:32.012
<i>Help all of us,
same as he's always done.</i>

01:35.884 --> 01:39.103
When the FBI picked me up
after the heist,

01:40.756 --> 01:44.257
I was convinced
that there was no way out.

01:50.766 --> 01:53.700
<i>That we were all going to jail.</i>

01:53.769 --> 01:58.238
<i>I turned myself inside out looking to</i>

01:58.306 --> 01:59.839
<i>keep you guys free of it.</i>

02:02.477 --> 02:06.279
<i>I tap danced, I stalled,
I fed misinformation,</i>

02:06.348 --> 02:09.449
<i>just trying to get us
out from underneath it.</i>

02:11.453 --> 02:15.889
I agreed to help the FBI
go after Bianchi

02:15.957 --> 02:19.726
in exchange for immunity for all of us.

02:22.998 --> 02:26.566
<i>A compromise to shield our family</i>

02:26.635 --> 02:30.904
<i>because what binds us together
is stronger than blood.</i>

02:42.451 --> 02:47.353
What I didn't realize was that
trying to salvage our freedom,

02:47.422 --> 02:49.456
I put us all in danger.

02:54.396 --> 02:57.330
<i>And every time I try to kill a threat...</i>

03:00.936 --> 03:03.870
<i>It just created a bigger one.</i>

03:03.939 --> 03:07.574
<i>And I-I realized that
it was getting away from me,</i>

03:07.642 --> 03:09.709
and that's when I went to Woz.

03:14.049 --> 03:17.550
So what you saw,
what you think you saw...

03:24.392 --> 03:26.726
Was him protecting me.

03:36.772 --> 03:38.921
<i>Protecting all of us.</i>

04:00.395 --> 04:03.396
I don't know
if I love you or if I hate you

04:03.465 --> 04:05.565
for what you just did.

04:05.634 --> 04:07.560
You and me both.

04:08.570 --> 04:10.882
It's a hell of a gesture,

04:11.740 --> 04:14.073
but it doesn't absolve either of us.

04:14.142 --> 04:16.353
It wasn't about absolution.

04:16.911 --> 04:21.548
That was just about
acknowledging what I did.

04:21.616 --> 04:23.516
They deserve to know the truth.

04:23.585 --> 04:25.351
But it's not the whole truth.

04:25.420 --> 04:28.721
The FBI turned you before the heist.

04:28.790 --> 04:32.971
The whole truth
would've broken us apart,

04:33.795 --> 04:34.894
and I won't let that happen.

04:34.963 --> 04:37.030
We are broken.

04:37.098 --> 04:39.465
We're broke.

04:39.534 --> 04:41.369
Not forever.

04:41.603 --> 04:44.103
When Bianchi's man got arrested,

04:44.172 --> 04:46.639
he took it as a personal challenge.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.842
There's gonna be blood.

04:48.910 --> 04:51.144
And what he's gonna do is he's...
he's gonna go for

04:51.213 --> 04:53.046
where we're the weakest.

04:53.114 --> 04:55.615
- Is this a feeling or...?
- Julia told me.

04:55.684 --> 04:58.866
She's the only one who has our back.

04:59.688 --> 05:02.989
My sister's picking up
Cristina in the morning.

05:03.058 --> 05:04.657
But we can't hide forever.

05:04.726 --> 05:05.982
I know.

05:06.082 --> 05:10.163
Keep your gloves on,
'cause we're striking first.

05:17.636 --> 05:19.636
Did you pack the tooth brush?

05:20.341 --> 05:22.408
Gonna pack for a couple days, Mom.

05:22.435 --> 05:24.702
<i>It's just a couple days, all right?</i>

05:24.771 --> 05:26.070
<i>I'll miss you like crazy.</i>

05:26.139 --> 05:27.438
<i>Don't forget your homework.</i>

05:27.507 --> 05:29.774
<i>Going to Jersey should have some perks.</i>

05:29.842 --> 05:31.876
Change of scenery.

05:31.944 --> 05:33.744
<i>Shouldn't affect your GPA.</i>

06:15.555 --> 06:18.456
Looks like we're running low on backup.

06:18.524 --> 06:19.784
Nobody?

06:19.809 --> 06:22.009
Loman. He logged in and took

06:22.078 --> 06:24.979
a dispatch call before I even got here.

06:25.048 --> 06:27.955
You know, I didn't get in
the first cab that pulled up.

06:28.918 --> 06:30.101
Or the second.

06:30.301 --> 06:32.320
I put a unit in front
of Nava's apartment,

06:32.388 --> 06:34.255
just as a precaution.

06:34.324 --> 06:35.957
This what it feels like to be hunted?

06:36.025 --> 06:40.261
All of human history
boils down to predator and prey.

06:41.831 --> 06:44.699
Yeah, I'm not sure that
I know the difference anymore.

06:44.767 --> 06:46.991
Who shoots first.

06:47.737 --> 06:50.871
Bianchi lost his leverage,
and he lost your gun.

06:50.940 --> 06:54.842
Now he'll be looking for more,
and our ranks are thin.

06:54.911 --> 06:56.207
Give him time.

06:56.276 --> 06:58.613
Right now, we have the leverage.

06:58.681 --> 06:59.814
Vincent Rossi's in holding.

06:59.882 --> 07:01.549
I'd prefer him in the ground.

07:01.618 --> 07:04.456
If we can get Rossi to talk,
we could hit up

07:04.525 --> 07:06.967
Bianchi's cash sources,
make it impossible

07:06.992 --> 07:08.029
for him to operate.

07:08.072 --> 07:10.591
A hit man would rather
cut his tongue out first.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.093
Look, it's worth a shot.

07:12.161 --> 07:13.861
I'm done being defensive.

07:20.036 --> 07:21.769
Desk sergeant said Rossi's
lawyer's trying to check in.

07:21.838 --> 07:23.804
I'll try and delay his entrance.

07:23.873 --> 07:25.178
How much time do you need?

07:25.203 --> 07:26.907
As much as you can give me.

07:26.976 --> 07:28.320
Stahl.

07:28.345 --> 07:29.973
You're gonna have to
deal with him eventually.

07:30.046 --> 07:31.206
The FBI's not going away.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.913
Yeah, but the FBI isn't
threatening our families.

07:32.982 --> 07:35.816
No, but they're
fitting us for handcuffs.

07:35.885 --> 07:38.386
You're standing in the way
of my client's right to counsel.

07:38.454 --> 07:40.488
Rossi, ending with a Y?

07:40.556 --> 07:43.557
R-O-S-S-I, as in "idiot."

07:44.185 --> 07:45.429
Not enough coffee in your coffee?

07:45.498 --> 07:46.460
Why is Vincent Rossi still here?

07:46.529 --> 07:48.846
You should've transferred him
to central booking.

07:48.915 --> 07:50.231
We had a few follow up questions.

07:52.991 --> 07:56.704
Where's my guardian angel,
the one who arrested me?

07:57.280 --> 07:58.879
I like her a lot better.

07:58.948 --> 08:00.948
She's tuning her harp.

08:01.017 --> 08:03.384
Did you ever go
to Sunday school, Vincent?

08:03.452 --> 08:06.320
Yeah, yeah, religiously.

08:06.389 --> 08:08.271
Let me catch you up.

08:08.791 --> 08:15.144
When an angel first visits
a human, you know what they say?

08:15.698 --> 08:17.765
"Be not afraid."

08:17.834 --> 08:20.467
Why do you think they say that?

08:20.536 --> 08:22.870
Because when people
are scared, they scream,

08:22.939 --> 08:24.644
and nobody likes screaming?

08:24.707 --> 08:26.774
Must be an occupational hazard for you.

08:26.843 --> 08:28.843
It means I didn't do my job effectively.

08:28.911 --> 08:32.813
Reason why angels say "be not afraid"

08:33.328 --> 08:35.049
is because they're terrifying.

08:35.116 --> 08:36.817
They're not the cute, little things

08:36.885 --> 08:39.404
that you see on greeting cards.

08:39.472 --> 08:41.962
Come on, don't ruin Hallmark.

08:42.032 --> 08:46.727
They're powerful creatures
who dole out judgment

08:46.796 --> 08:50.464
and enforce the will of God.

08:50.533 --> 08:52.967
Targets come in an envelope.

08:53.035 --> 08:54.735
I don't choose them.

08:55.516 --> 08:56.785
I don't ask questions.

08:56.854 --> 08:57.872
That's good.

08:57.940 --> 09:00.341
I need some answers.

09:02.184 --> 09:04.510
Hey, bro! Cuckoo!

09:04.579 --> 09:06.313
Cuckoo!

09:06.382 --> 09:08.211
I didn't keep you waiting long, did I?

09:08.280 --> 09:09.717
- No, no.
- 'Sup, man?

09:12.972 --> 09:15.222
All right, man, you look good.
You look good.

09:15.291 --> 09:16.835
What happened to your legs?

09:16.898 --> 09:17.864
Hey, shut up, man.

09:17.908 --> 09:19.576
Come on, man, I'm serious.
I can't see them.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.267
- Yo, is camo still in?
- Yeah.

09:21.336 --> 09:23.615
- Maybe I'll go back inside.
- Yo, yo, come here, man.

09:23.684 --> 09:28.074
I... hey, I will never let that
happen again, all right?

09:28.143 --> 09:29.943
You out, now I'll stay out.

09:30.011 --> 09:31.611
I've seen these stairs twice.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.055
Where's my client?

09:33.080 --> 09:34.568
Standing on the right side of the law.

09:34.602 --> 09:35.548
There's a twist for you.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.183
Clearly not the side
you're familiar with.

09:37.252 --> 09:39.652
These men don't talk, Detective.

09:39.721 --> 09:41.187
Well, if Bianchi's so sure about that,

09:41.256 --> 09:43.723
why are you in such a rush?

09:45.560 --> 09:48.191
How do you think this day ends?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.422
Like any other.

09:50.699 --> 09:52.888
Yeah, well,
I could make sure that it does

09:52.956 --> 09:54.434
or I could make sure that it doesn't.

09:56.271 --> 09:58.069
This interrogation is over.

09:58.138 --> 09:59.332
Couldn't agree more.

09:59.379 --> 10:00.845
What took you so long?

10:00.914 --> 10:02.213
We'll move him back
to holding when you're done.

10:02.282 --> 10:03.815
I'll have those papers signed,

10:03.883 --> 10:05.783
we'll get that
protective custody thing going.

10:05.852 --> 10:06.751
What papers?

10:06.820 --> 10:08.786
Be not afraid.

10:12.892 --> 10:14.221
You got him to talk?

10:14.290 --> 10:15.927
No, but maybe we don't need him to.

10:15.995 --> 10:17.895
All we need is for the mafia
to think he turned snitch.

10:17.964 --> 10:19.931
Yeah, that would be Bianchi's liability.

10:19.999 --> 10:21.699
And our leverage.

10:21.768 --> 10:23.962
We need to convince him
that Rossi's working with us.

10:24.030 --> 10:26.680
And I think the lawyer's gonna
whisper into Bianchi's ear.

10:26.728 --> 10:27.994
I don't think that's gonna be enough,

10:28.063 --> 10:30.964
but I know where we can get
actual intel to back it up.

10:31.033 --> 10:32.706
Well, go get it, because this charade's

10:32.775 --> 10:34.234
not gonna last much longer.

10:34.303 --> 10:36.069
I just... I just don't know that

10:36.138 --> 10:38.371
I wanna owe Stahl a favor.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.308
Well, how do you feel
about surviving the day?

10:45.047 --> 10:47.705
And they say New York is a big city.

10:48.350 --> 10:49.936
I don't know,

10:50.452 --> 10:53.320
but I think you're supposed to

10:53.388 --> 10:55.322
take these things out.

10:58.026 --> 11:00.327
Busy morning, and a busy day after that,

11:00.395 --> 11:02.429
so what do you got for me?

11:02.497 --> 11:04.397
You know where Bianchi
has dinner and you know

11:04.466 --> 11:06.900
where he cleans his cash.

11:06.968 --> 11:09.035
I need more inside information.

11:09.104 --> 11:11.037
Bianchi's already killed
Nava's ex, Caroline,

11:11.106 --> 11:13.039
and now he's coming after us.

11:13.108 --> 11:15.542
- And this one's on you.
- Me?

11:15.610 --> 11:17.277
You arresting his button man
had nothing to do with it, huh?

11:17.346 --> 11:20.596
Do you know how easy it would be for me

11:20.664 --> 11:22.862
to feed Bianchi your name?

11:23.852 --> 11:25.418
That would involve Wozniak admitting

11:25.487 --> 11:26.986
that he's informing for the FBI.

11:27.055 --> 11:28.965
Or coming up with a plausible story.

11:28.990 --> 11:31.291
A story that would destroy
his career and put him

11:31.360 --> 11:33.126
and your crew in jail.

11:33.195 --> 11:35.829
Not as high a price as his family.

11:36.452 --> 11:38.175
I'm done doing your homework
for you, Harlee.

11:38.244 --> 11:39.855
But you're okay just standing by

11:39.924 --> 11:42.202
watching innocents get hurt?

11:42.270 --> 11:45.205
We're more often afraid than
we are actually harmed, Harlee.

11:45.273 --> 11:48.456
I think Bianchi's just using
your imagination against you.

11:48.481 --> 11:50.748
Tell that to Caroline's imagination.

11:50.816 --> 11:53.984
Last time I checked, it was
spread all over the ground.

11:57.923 --> 12:00.390
There's a beautiful thing
about pain, Harlee.

12:00.415 --> 12:03.049
It's either severe or prolonged,

12:03.118 --> 12:05.355
but it's never both.

12:06.221 --> 12:08.688
This case, it just seems senseless.

12:08.757 --> 12:11.524
Please, I'm asking for your help.

12:11.593 --> 12:13.826
Maybe you're looking at it
through the wrong prism.

12:13.895 --> 12:16.162
Take this house I know on Cropsey.

12:16.231 --> 12:18.045
From the outside,
it doesn't look like much,

12:18.114 --> 12:20.066
but inside, it's this
high-tech gambling hub,

12:20.135 --> 12:22.001
all perfectly illegal.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.103
And this gambling operation is run by?

12:24.172 --> 12:25.438
Your mafia friend.

12:25.507 --> 12:27.810
High stakes, big money coming in and out

12:27.878 --> 12:30.143
through offshore wireless transfers.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.257
Robert.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.317
Thank you.

12:37.385 --> 12:39.852
If you win, buy me something nice,

12:39.921 --> 12:41.955
like a councilwoman.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.133
Oh, no, no.

12:54.202 --> 12:55.735
I thought you were upstate.

12:55.804 --> 12:59.839
Last time I came home,
you had a gun in your hand.

12:59.908 --> 13:01.641
I'm not sure this is progress.

13:01.710 --> 13:04.677
Well, it's the right tool for the job.

13:04.746 --> 13:07.847
I asked you to stay away,
and you decide to come back.

13:07.916 --> 13:10.750
No, you asked me to go someplace safe.

13:10.819 --> 13:14.554
Yeah, but not here, not now.

13:14.622 --> 13:17.168
Turns out, despite everything,

13:17.237 --> 13:18.891
I only feel safe when I'm with you.

13:19.336 --> 13:22.587
Linda, these guys
that I'm dealing with are very...

13:22.655 --> 13:24.873
I don't care who they are.

13:24.942 --> 13:27.275
No one is chasing me away from my home.

13:27.344 --> 13:30.278
Linda, it's what I'm dying
to hear you say,

13:30.347 --> 13:32.080
but I need you to be safe.

13:32.149 --> 13:35.028
How am I gonna make sure you're safe?

13:36.252 --> 13:38.854
I only came here so that
I can sleep at night.

13:39.256 --> 13:41.668
What makes you think
I'm gonna let you sleep?

13:42.931 --> 13:44.793
'Cause you'll be on the couch.

13:44.862 --> 13:46.819
So that's how you're gonna protect me?

13:46.888 --> 13:48.235
Mm-hmm,

13:49.381 --> 13:50.616
you'll be safer there.

13:50.660 --> 13:53.001
I started carrying that gun you gave me.

13:53.070 --> 13:55.795
- Well, that's progress.
- No, it's paranoia.

13:56.943 --> 13:59.853
That stranger spooked me
in the bookstore yesterday.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.295
What stranger?

14:01.345 --> 14:03.612
Some weird guy in a... in a flashy suit.

14:03.637 --> 14:06.071
He came right up to me
and then said something

14:06.140 --> 14:08.607
about the weather turning brutal.

14:08.676 --> 14:09.508
Gave me the chills.

14:09.577 --> 14:11.095
All right, I'll get the door.

14:11.163 --> 14:12.511
Thank you.

14:16.617 --> 14:18.919
I can be brutal too.

14:23.767 --> 14:25.444
What do you know about this yellow?

14:25.469 --> 14:26.582
It's not yellow.

14:26.642 --> 14:29.376
It's "desert glow,"
like sunset at the Mojave.

14:29.445 --> 14:31.378
More like living inside of a lemon.

14:31.447 --> 14:32.346
Maybe a banana.

14:32.415 --> 14:33.928
Beats a gray box.

14:34.650 --> 14:35.449
Hey.

14:35.814 --> 14:37.227
Hey, look who decided to show up.

14:37.260 --> 14:38.553
The game's still playing in the bar,

14:38.588 --> 14:39.620
if you're gonna be this ungrateful.

14:39.689 --> 14:41.411
Try pissed off at Harlee and Woz.

14:41.436 --> 14:42.569
Yeah.

14:42.621 --> 14:45.660
The only reason I'm here is,
I didn't feel like clocking in.

14:45.734 --> 14:46.733
Me neither.

14:46.758 --> 14:48.858
Makes you wonder what else
they've been hiding.

14:49.565 --> 14:51.565
All that talk about
how the unit is a family.

14:51.634 --> 14:53.271
Family is family.

14:53.296 --> 14:55.903
Yeah, well, we bought into
the con, hook, line, and sinker.

14:55.972 --> 14:57.204
I almost ended up
in Rikers to show for it.

14:57.273 --> 14:58.606
Who's to say we still won't?

14:58.674 --> 15:00.007
You better hope you don't.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.109
That place will make you
regret being a cop real fast.

15:02.178 --> 15:03.444
Maybe I already do, man.

15:10.853 --> 15:12.255
Espada, what the hell are you doing?

15:12.280 --> 15:14.255
- Painting.
- You painted over the yellow.

15:14.323 --> 15:16.423
You wanted this yellow?

15:17.827 --> 15:20.227
What did Stahl ask
in return for this intel

15:20.296 --> 15:22.162
on Bianchi's venture here?

15:22.231 --> 15:24.064
Julia and a thank you card.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.699
Do I have to sign it?

15:25.768 --> 15:27.005
Where's this mob front?

15:27.074 --> 15:28.123
Two houses down.

15:28.147 --> 15:29.618
Blue bird bath.

15:30.339 --> 15:31.605
Thanks for showing up.

15:31.674 --> 15:34.675
One for all, all for one, or some crap.

15:34.777 --> 15:35.876
Aw, I count three.

15:35.945 --> 15:38.307
Well, I think the others
are still considering

15:38.346 --> 15:39.412
the invitation.

15:39.448 --> 15:42.216
No, if they're not here
by now, they're not coming.

15:42.591 --> 15:45.532
Woz, three of us can't cover the exits,

15:45.557 --> 15:46.793
much less each other.

15:46.818 --> 15:51.458
What we lack in numbers
we'll make up for in grit.

15:51.527 --> 15:52.860
Let's get 'em.

15:56.732 --> 15:58.528
I thought this was a friendly visit

15:58.596 --> 16:00.567
to convince Bianchi he had a leak.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.571
Step to the bell,
you might as well ring it.

16:06.042 --> 16:08.657
NYPD, this is a raid!

16:08.682 --> 16:10.216
Have you lost your mind?
You know whose place this is?

16:10.284 --> 16:12.418
I got a pretty good idea.

16:12.486 --> 16:14.553
Tell Bianchi

16:14.622 --> 16:16.121
his hit man

16:16.190 --> 16:18.357
is talking.

16:22.930 --> 16:25.331
You are better at keeping
enemies than I thought.

16:25.399 --> 16:27.233
Bianchi threatened Linda.

16:27.301 --> 16:29.268
After that, nothing is out of bounds.

16:29.337 --> 16:33.239
I warned you to keep you safe,
not to pour gasoline on a fire.

16:33.307 --> 16:35.207
What, do you think I'm gonna lay low?

16:35.276 --> 16:37.343
I'm gonna bring this
right to his door step.

16:37.411 --> 16:40.079
Well, now it's come to mine,
so thank you, Matt,

16:40.147 --> 16:43.716
for being exactly as reckless
as I'd hoped I forget.

16:43.784 --> 16:47.789
We were looking to get
Bianchi's attention, not yours.

16:47.814 --> 16:49.780
What, do you expect him
to walk in here himself?

16:49.849 --> 16:52.683
No, we expect him
to walk away permanently.

16:52.752 --> 16:54.618
He got to us.
Now he knows we can get to him.

16:54.687 --> 16:57.321
He wants a guarantee
that you won't be making

16:57.390 --> 17:01.492
more house calls, and your word
will not be enough.

17:03.162 --> 17:05.465
We'll sell him his snitch.

17:06.132 --> 17:07.993
The price of peace.

17:08.501 --> 17:11.435
He gets Rossi. We get an end to this.

17:11.503 --> 17:14.137
Okay, then make the offer yourself.

17:14.207 --> 17:15.295
We just did.

17:15.363 --> 17:17.375
No, not to me, to him.

17:17.443 --> 17:19.377
Bianchi wants another face-to-face,

17:19.444 --> 17:23.079
and this time
he has asked me to moderate.

17:23.148 --> 17:25.782
No, I'm not bringing you into this.

17:25.852 --> 17:28.152
You already have, Matt.

17:37.864 --> 17:39.029
Banker's hours, Loman?

17:39.098 --> 17:40.486
Not today, Harlee.

17:40.547 --> 17:42.633
Heard you took a little
field trip this morning.

17:42.658 --> 17:44.128
Yeah, I felt like doing
a little police work.

17:44.153 --> 17:46.203
We're detectives.
We don't take dispatch calls.

17:46.272 --> 17:48.526
So what is it that we do, exactly, huh?

17:48.713 --> 17:49.779
I'm getting a little fuzzy.

17:49.848 --> 17:52.281
- I'll tell you what
we don't do: work alone.

17:52.350 --> 17:53.683
That's why it's called a unit.

17:53.752 --> 17:56.068
Let's talk about family.

17:57.288 --> 18:00.456
Tell you what, you really
can sell a story, Harlee.

18:04.149 --> 18:09.094
Loman, Loman, this isn't
the time to splinter.

18:09.119 --> 18:10.313
I just wanna be a cop.

18:10.338 --> 18:11.534
That's all I ever wanted,
and now I've drifted.

18:11.603 --> 18:15.972
Listen, no one in our crew
lands on their back.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.840
When you were about to fall,
I caught you.

18:17.909 --> 18:20.109
Woz did too, and we'll do it again.

18:20.178 --> 18:22.023
You also told me you did the heist

18:22.046 --> 18:24.914
to protect me from Donnie Pomp,
which was a lie.

18:24.983 --> 18:26.749
It was more than a lie. It was a setup.

18:26.818 --> 18:29.524
- Loman...
- I killed Donnie Pomp.

18:30.388 --> 18:33.723
I killed him in Wozniak's house,
but he tried to kill me first.

18:33.792 --> 18:35.581
I used a knife.

18:36.761 --> 18:38.516
I know.

18:39.097 --> 18:40.943
You know?

18:41.633 --> 18:43.191
Wozniak told you.

18:43.268 --> 18:46.035
And he told me it was self-defense.

18:46.441 --> 18:48.037
There was no setup, Loman.

18:48.106 --> 18:51.007
We all have to carry our own sins...

18:51.775 --> 18:52.842
or bury them.

18:53.913 --> 18:56.042
Hey, Rossi's in the van
to central booking.

18:56.069 --> 18:58.306
What? Who approved that?

18:58.375 --> 19:01.038
I filed the transfer
this morning before I left.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.007
It was on my desk.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.305
Look at me, real man.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.277
I got my own tools and everything.

19:36.346 --> 19:38.463
I've been waiting to see
this thing the whole day,

19:38.532 --> 19:40.077
waiting for it.
Pat yourself on the back.

19:44.588 --> 19:46.254
What am I running, a summer camp?

19:46.323 --> 19:48.590
When your lieutenant
calls for backup, you show up.

19:48.659 --> 19:51.359
You don't leave your team
hanging for arts and crafts.

19:51.428 --> 19:53.170
We didn't sign up for any of this.

19:53.308 --> 19:54.673
Well, some of us did.

19:54.698 --> 19:57.532
Right on the dotted line
of the FBI immunity deal.

19:57.601 --> 20:00.035
You might wanna
walk that back, Detective.

20:00.103 --> 20:01.397
Doesn't change its truth.

20:01.465 --> 20:03.171
Wallace, wrangle your brother

20:03.240 --> 20:05.440
before he has a serious lapse
in judgment.

20:05.509 --> 20:07.237
Oh, like when you had me on the pavement

20:07.262 --> 20:08.549
'cause you thought I was
talking to Internal Affairs?

20:08.618 --> 20:10.078
No. That kind of lapse?

20:10.147 --> 20:13.215
Every day I show up
because I know we're stronger

20:13.283 --> 20:16.918
as a unit than we are by ourselves.

20:16.987 --> 20:19.321
Our team is being hunted right now,

20:19.389 --> 20:20.922
and we're running out of time.

20:20.991 --> 20:23.291
So you're coming back with me
to the station,

20:23.360 --> 20:25.160
and you're gonna do your job.

20:25.229 --> 20:29.564
And if I have to take you back
in cuffs, I will.

20:32.135 --> 20:36.471
You know, I've been thinking
about what I would've done,

20:36.540 --> 20:38.974
had the FBI picked me up.

20:39.042 --> 20:40.675
Who are the people I love?

20:40.744 --> 20:42.777
Two kids at home.

20:43.324 --> 20:45.997
All I want is to watch them grow up.

20:47.358 --> 20:48.350
It's hard not to think
that I wouldn't be sitting

20:48.418 --> 20:50.781
right where you are.

20:52.142 --> 20:55.615
No matter how many times
I replayed what happened,

20:56.870 --> 20:59.060
I can't see any other angle.

21:06.202 --> 21:09.504
Well, at least you went to Woz.

21:10.142 --> 21:11.806
It's the difference
between you and Saperstein.

21:19.567 --> 21:22.550
Harlee, you okay?

21:24.457 --> 21:25.453
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:26.170 --> 21:27.826
You don't seem fine.

21:29.089 --> 21:30.771
Why don't you let me run you home?

21:30.840 --> 21:32.691
It's been a rough one.

21:34.478 --> 21:36.275
Let's rearrest this guy first.

21:49.948 --> 21:51.615
If I was speeding,
it's only 'cause I hate

21:51.683 --> 21:53.583
this part of the job.

21:53.652 --> 21:54.851
I'll allow it this once, Lewis.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.586
You got Vincent Rossi back there?

21:56.655 --> 21:59.089
Something tells me you know I do.

21:59.157 --> 22:02.125
We turned in our paperwork,
without our LT signature.

22:02.194 --> 22:04.194
He's not ready for transfer.

22:08.567 --> 22:10.166
Who's the guy in the car?

22:10.235 --> 22:11.968
Bianchi's hit man.

22:12.037 --> 22:13.271
That's our assignment?

22:13.318 --> 22:15.205
Yeah, thanks for coming through.

22:15.274 --> 22:16.840
Like we had a choice.

22:16.909 --> 22:20.977
Here, keep an eye on him
until the call comes.

22:21.046 --> 22:22.988
You know I haven't said a word.

22:23.013 --> 22:25.548
Well, you might want to
consider a few to your maker.

22:27.352 --> 22:29.152
Does he know what he's in for?

22:29.221 --> 22:31.321
No, but he knows he deserves it.

22:39.331 --> 22:43.765
793, 837.

22:43.834 --> 22:44.940
Agent Stahl?

22:45.008 --> 22:46.119
We're adding and subtracting.

22:46.144 --> 22:47.462
It's Ayres.

22:48.396 --> 22:49.395
What about her?

22:49.420 --> 22:52.021
Surveillance has her arriving
to meet with Detective Santos.

22:52.090 --> 22:52.788
Where?

22:55.927 --> 22:58.002
Guess it was my turn to come to you.

22:58.496 --> 23:00.863
Well, you said you wanted
someplace private.

23:04.602 --> 23:06.502
I've always loved your home.

23:15.847 --> 23:17.980
<i>So you ready to do this?</i>

23:18.049 --> 23:19.648
<i>Send a man to his death?</i>

23:20.456 --> 23:22.451
I call him more of an animal, actually.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.720
I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.

23:24.789 --> 23:25.921
Then what are you saying?

23:26.124 --> 23:29.625
We can avoid all of this
if we just give Bianchi a name.

23:29.694 --> 23:32.595
I know Woz. This isn't how he operates.

23:32.663 --> 23:34.697
He wouldn't start a war with a mob boss

23:34.766 --> 23:37.586
that he couldn't win, not on his own.

23:38.536 --> 23:40.669
Doesn't matter where it started,

23:40.738 --> 23:41.913
only that it ends here.

23:41.982 --> 23:43.400
It matters to me.

23:43.469 --> 23:46.242
If you tell me who put him up to it,

23:46.310 --> 23:48.811
then I can make sure
he's not getting played.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.613
He can take care of himself.

23:50.681 --> 23:52.548
<i>Yeah, and what about you?</i>

23:52.617 --> 23:54.847
<i>You know, this kind of thing
can destroy you,</i>

23:54.872 --> 23:56.805
make you wish to hell you could go back.

23:56.874 --> 23:58.968
You think I don't know
what that feels like?

23:59.476 --> 24:00.542
You can still walk away, Harlee.

24:00.611 --> 24:01.710
Protect yourself.

24:02.283 --> 24:05.878
Or I can stay here and
protect the people that I love.

24:06.417 --> 24:08.350
From where I'm standing,
there is no choice.

24:08.419 --> 24:10.686
There is always a choice.

24:10.754 --> 24:13.239
I guess that's the difference
between me and you.

24:14.558 --> 24:17.793
Then I'll see you at the docks tonight.

24:26.537 --> 24:29.832
You still think you can
keep secrets from me, Harlee.

24:48.848 --> 24:52.483
I guess God didn't grant me
enough serenity.

24:52.552 --> 24:54.652
Don't worry about it, man.

24:54.721 --> 24:56.698
I brought some more.

24:58.658 --> 25:01.058
And I stopped asking God for things

25:01.127 --> 25:02.627
a long time ago, really.

25:02.695 --> 25:04.462
Just wasn't listening.

25:04.531 --> 25:06.097
You can't give up so easy

25:06.166 --> 25:08.966
just 'cause you don't see results.

25:09.035 --> 25:10.668
Hey, I've seen plenty of results,

25:10.737 --> 25:12.069
just not the ones I wanted.

25:12.138 --> 25:14.338
That's not God's fault.

25:14.407 --> 25:17.808
That's people.
They never fail to disappoint.

25:17.877 --> 25:20.912
Unless you expect the worst,

25:20.980 --> 25:23.247
even from your nearest and dearest.

25:23.316 --> 25:25.655
You got anyone near and dear to you?

25:26.386 --> 25:29.487
Someone who you'd do
almost anything for?

25:29.556 --> 25:31.330
I guess we all do.

25:31.355 --> 25:33.524
That's where the biggest
disappointments come from.

25:33.593 --> 25:36.354
It can get lonely otherwise.

25:46.573 --> 25:47.959
Don't kid yourself, man.

25:48.027 --> 25:49.707
We're all alone.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.621
When did we become
judge, jury, and executioner?

26:03.690 --> 26:05.957
He murdered an innocent woman,
and probably many others.

26:06.025 --> 26:08.526
I'm not saying I feel
sorry for him, Tess.

26:08.595 --> 26:10.995
I'm saying I'm tired
of blindly following orders.

26:11.064 --> 26:12.863
Well, that's how a squad works.

26:12.932 --> 26:15.032
But who's giving
the orders at this point?

26:15.101 --> 26:16.867
Yeah, and how do we know
this isn't a setup?

26:16.936 --> 26:18.130
Oh, come on.

26:18.203 --> 26:19.657
Aren't we responsible
if something happens

26:19.682 --> 26:20.638
to him while he's in protective?

26:20.707 --> 26:22.213
Now who's responsible for you, huh?

26:22.287 --> 26:24.709
Every time you make a mistake,
Woz is there to fix it.

26:24.777 --> 26:26.444
And whenever you have a problem,
Harlee has to listen

26:26.512 --> 26:28.045
to you whine about it,
then she walks you

26:28.114 --> 26:29.647
through the options.

26:29.716 --> 26:32.183
I mean, they've carried sins
for all of us.

26:34.536 --> 26:36.854
This is not a damn setup.

26:44.497 --> 26:46.906
It'll all be over soon.

26:47.667 --> 26:49.930
Not until we choose differently.

26:50.503 --> 26:53.971
Once we get Bianchi
off our backs, maybe we can.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.283
We're bargaining with a life.

26:57.076 --> 26:58.938
That doesn't bother you?

26:59.812 --> 27:01.846
If someone's dying tonight,

27:01.914 --> 27:04.115
at least it's someone who's earned it.

27:05.652 --> 27:07.518
Might want to check that list.

27:07.587 --> 27:09.553
I think we're all on it.

27:28.841 --> 27:32.243
Bianchi's not gonna shoot
at two cops out in the open.

27:32.312 --> 27:33.944
A deserted dock late at night?

27:34.013 --> 27:36.080
Seems pretty private to me.

27:39.986 --> 27:41.919
Turn it off.

27:41.988 --> 27:43.621
What, do you see something?

27:43.690 --> 27:44.915
Think a trick of the light?

27:45.102 --> 27:46.442
What the hell's a trick of the light?

27:46.515 --> 27:48.125
I saw some movement. I can't be sure.

27:48.194 --> 27:50.561
Harlee, if you know
something that I don't...

27:50.630 --> 27:52.897
Woz, I'm on your side.

27:54.434 --> 27:55.966
Okay.

27:58.805 --> 28:00.504
We can still abort.

28:00.573 --> 28:05.176
No, no, we're not
going home empty-handed.

28:31.003 --> 28:34.605
I was told by our mutual friend

28:34.674 --> 28:37.208
those wouldn't be necessary.

28:37.276 --> 28:38.876
All right.

28:40.530 --> 28:42.530
_

28:44.482 --> 28:47.017
Charles, let's drive
straight to the event.

28:47.086 --> 28:49.720
I won't be visiting
with old friends after all.

28:49.789 --> 28:54.385
Just making sure our guns
don't get stolen again.

28:55.795 --> 28:58.796
It looks like she gave up
on us playing nice.

28:58.865 --> 29:03.667
Tell that bitch to turn around,
or this will come back on her.

29:14.180 --> 29:17.715
They say there's a bullet
waiting for us all somewhere.

29:17.784 --> 29:22.052
You tell Ayres I can
call hers in anytime I want.

29:22.121 --> 29:23.754
Or we can end this now.

29:23.823 --> 29:27.224
All right, you have a problem.
We have a solution, okay?

29:27.293 --> 29:30.227
Take this, and the loose-lipped
hit man is yours,

29:30.296 --> 29:31.523
and we call it even.

29:31.548 --> 29:33.831
No, call it even when you tell me

29:33.900 --> 29:35.555
who's pulling your strings.

29:35.601 --> 29:38.335
Nature of handjobs and peace accords.

29:38.404 --> 29:40.604
No one's completely satisfied.

29:40.673 --> 29:41.772
We can dismantle your operation

29:41.841 --> 29:43.774
by the end of the week if we keep

29:43.843 --> 29:45.843
raiding your locations.

29:48.181 --> 29:51.916
Your own man helping us sink you?

29:51.984 --> 29:53.551
I would think that's gotta sting more

29:53.619 --> 29:56.185
than a couple of headstrong cops.

29:56.956 --> 29:59.190
Address is on the card.

29:59.258 --> 30:03.050
Chaperone will be gone
as soon as we make it home safe.

30:03.963 --> 30:07.198
Fix your leak however you choose.

30:10.369 --> 30:11.402
Woz!

30:11.471 --> 30:12.903
No one better follow us,

30:12.972 --> 30:17.908
and don't you ever get close
to my wife again,

30:17.977 --> 30:20.945
or you're gonna be watching the door,

30:21.013 --> 30:23.714
and I'm coming through it.

30:46.723 --> 30:48.003
Espada, wake up.

30:48.028 --> 30:49.490
I'm awake. You were feeding me popcorn.

30:49.559 --> 30:51.330
Why would I stop you?

30:52.162 --> 30:54.128
End of shift. Let's go.

30:54.197 --> 30:55.927
- We made the deal.
- That's it?

30:55.995 --> 30:57.699
We just leave him here like this?

30:57.767 --> 30:59.147
Price of peace.

30:59.216 --> 31:01.457
Not a price I agreed to pay.

31:02.572 --> 31:04.539
- We need to clear out.
- Do we?

31:04.608 --> 31:06.379
A couple hours ago,
we needed to guard him.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.376
A few weeks ago, we needed
to heist an armored car,

31:08.445 --> 31:10.761
and last night,
we needed to forgive you.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.586
Espada, did you need
any of those things?

31:12.654 --> 31:14.177
Because I did not.

31:14.656 --> 31:16.857
And we amount to you and Wozniak

31:16.925 --> 31:19.459
the boss man and the favorite child.

31:19.528 --> 31:21.328
- Are you finished?
- No, I could keep going.

31:21.396 --> 31:22.895
We gave Bianchi our word.

31:23.018 --> 31:25.432
We break our promise, and
it's open season on all of us.

31:25.501 --> 31:26.984
You know, if you want him dead so bad,

31:27.009 --> 31:29.469
why don't you take this gun
and kill him yourself?

31:33.375 --> 31:35.709
We all killed him, Tufo.

31:35.777 --> 31:37.377
We're all guilty.

31:37.446 --> 31:40.447
Then you better prove
your conscience can handle it.

31:44.586 --> 31:45.952
The only way we all make it home safe

31:46.021 --> 31:50.298
every night is if we have
each other's backs.

31:51.026 --> 31:53.674
If you can't do that anymore,

31:54.129 --> 31:56.463
then maybe this isn't your place.

32:07.809 --> 32:09.876
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:09.945 --> 32:11.711
Didn't think I'd be
seeing you again tonight.

32:11.780 --> 32:14.481
Well, some things
are better said in person.

32:14.550 --> 32:16.516
What happened with Bianchi?

32:16.585 --> 32:18.618
Why the wave off?

32:19.788 --> 32:22.772
You know, I always worry
when I'm on a roof.

32:23.825 --> 32:26.092
Ever since I was a kid,

32:26.161 --> 32:28.790
I always thought I'd step off,

32:29.431 --> 32:33.565
never knowing if or why I wanted to.

32:35.404 --> 32:38.071
Just curious what would happen, I guess.

32:38.140 --> 32:39.839
I can give you a hint.

32:39.908 --> 32:41.408
Messy crime scene.

32:41.476 --> 32:43.643
But easy solves though.

32:46.014 --> 32:48.949
Yeah, I...

32:49.017 --> 32:51.952
I saw the Feds at the dock.

32:53.655 --> 32:55.287
Feds?

32:56.158 --> 32:57.902
Are you sure?

32:58.794 --> 33:01.654
Yeah, they're chasing Bianchi,

33:02.030 --> 33:06.032
but I want to make sure that
they don't get you instead.

33:19.047 --> 33:20.714
They're here.

33:20.782 --> 33:22.082
<i>Okay.</i>

33:22.150 --> 33:23.116
You at the office?

33:23.185 --> 33:25.719
Just long enough to decompress.

33:25.787 --> 33:27.487
That wouldn't involve
a shot of something?

33:27.556 --> 33:30.857
No, Carlos, I'm gonna talk
about my thoughts and feelings

33:30.926 --> 33:32.926
and have a good cry.

33:32.995 --> 33:34.493
Pour three.

34:08.630 --> 34:12.465
What are you doing?

34:12.534 --> 34:14.934
You only call me when you need a favor?

34:15.003 --> 34:16.803
I'm no longer your asset, Stahl.

34:16.871 --> 34:17.935
No, you're not.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.706
You're something else now, aren't you?

34:19.775 --> 34:22.609
You take, and you take,
until there's nothing left.

34:22.678 --> 34:23.873
You really think I wasn't gonna find out

34:23.943 --> 34:25.322
about your meeting today?

34:25.781 --> 34:27.813
I'm done playing
the giving game now, Harlee.

34:27.882 --> 34:30.949
Someone as unhinged as you
shouldn't play, period.

34:31.018 --> 34:32.786
We could've wound up
with a bullet between the eyes

34:32.853 --> 34:33.989
thanks to your incompetence.

34:34.014 --> 34:35.889
You've already played
the vulnerable card today.

34:35.956 --> 34:38.024
- Try a new one.
- We both saw you.

34:38.092 --> 34:40.092
If we did, Bianchi could've.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.628
You didn't see anything.

34:41.697 --> 34:44.130
Trailer, end of the marina.

34:47.268 --> 34:49.668
Well, bravo, Harlee.

34:49.737 --> 34:50.704
You could've ended everything tonight,

34:50.772 --> 34:53.460
but instead, you did what?
You warned Ayres?

34:54.042 --> 34:55.842
It's time to make up for that.

34:55.911 --> 34:57.877
- Get her on tape.
- I'm not wearing that.

34:57.946 --> 35:00.480
Yes, you are, and you're gonna find out

35:00.549 --> 35:01.815
exactly what Ayres knows.

35:01.883 --> 35:03.783
I'm done playing the giving game.

35:03.852 --> 35:05.786
Oh, play a little longer.

35:06.722 --> 35:08.189
Give me a hint.

35:09.057 --> 35:11.124
Here's a hint.

35:13.462 --> 35:14.828
Leave now, or you're gonna
hurt for days.

35:14.896 --> 35:18.598
Tell me something regarding what 574S

35:18.667 --> 35:21.267
has to do with Detective Saperstein.

35:23.839 --> 35:25.271
Don't you get it yet?

35:25.340 --> 35:28.174
I know all of your secrets.

35:30.245 --> 35:31.644
And I have a strong feeling
you're gonna end up

35:31.713 --> 35:34.748
in jail with your crew after all.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.194
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:09.410 --> 36:10.443
Where's yours?

36:10.511 --> 36:13.813
I'm not the one
who needs liquid courage.

36:20.822 --> 36:23.956
Okay, what have you got?

36:25.426 --> 36:27.493
It's a few things.

36:31.265 --> 36:34.600
It's... I don't know. It's tricky.

36:34.669 --> 36:38.419
No, Espada. It's not tricky.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.971
You changed my life.

36:43.578 --> 36:45.778
I was just a...

36:45.847 --> 36:48.848
man, I was a punk-ass kid.

36:48.950 --> 36:53.486
I was getting by on just
wise-cracks and sucker punches.

36:53.554 --> 36:55.490
I had no self-respect.

36:56.124 --> 36:57.755
I had no purpose.

37:00.428 --> 37:01.961
You gave me that.

37:02.029 --> 37:04.196
It means you were looking for it.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.031
That's what matters.

37:06.100 --> 37:12.738
What matters is you believed in me.

37:12.807 --> 37:15.231
You believed in me
when nobody else would.

37:25.820 --> 37:27.334
I just hope you still do.

37:36.798 --> 37:38.497
What is that?

37:38.566 --> 37:40.533
It's a request for transfer.

37:43.938 --> 37:46.272
<i>Et tu, Brute?</i>

37:49.911 --> 37:52.676
Middle finger puts pressure on the seam,

37:53.581 --> 37:55.748
hook the wrist, pull down, and release

37:55.817 --> 37:57.760
and get on top of the ball.

37:58.853 --> 38:01.353
That's how you throw a curve.

38:01.422 --> 38:03.106
I taught myself.

38:03.858 --> 38:05.371
The only thing my dad ever taught me

38:05.440 --> 38:07.693
was how to make it out of the door

38:07.762 --> 38:09.094
without waking people up.

38:09.163 --> 38:11.063
I've seen that once or twice.

38:11.132 --> 38:13.011
Yeah, you have.

38:14.535 --> 38:17.703
You know, I was always
scared to have kids.

38:17.772 --> 38:20.639
I didn't know
anything about it, you know?

38:20.708 --> 38:23.748
How to take care of them
when they come home crying,

38:24.679 --> 38:26.479
how to keep them safe.

38:26.547 --> 38:29.307
You know I never saw
what that looked like.

38:32.119 --> 38:37.256
I am going to be a great dad
some day because of you,

38:37.325 --> 38:39.642
and that's a hell of a gift.

38:40.628 --> 38:43.762
So... you got a gift too?

38:43.831 --> 38:47.766
You're... you want to transfer?

38:57.912 --> 39:01.113
I don't. I don't want to transfer.

39:03.885 --> 39:07.419
I have lost track
of what it means to wear that.

39:07.488 --> 39:09.623
And I need some time away.

39:18.733 --> 39:20.271
Okay.

39:22.169 --> 39:24.970
So much for stronger together.

39:56.904 --> 39:59.104
One sec.

40:05.780 --> 40:06.712
My turn to visit again.

40:06.781 --> 40:08.714
Harlee, I'm sorry, I have talking points

40:08.783 --> 40:10.883
to go over right now. I-I can't.

40:10.952 --> 40:11.717
So do I.

40:11.786 --> 40:14.086
Ma'am, everything okay?

40:14.155 --> 40:15.417
Yeah, it's all right, Ron.

40:15.486 --> 40:17.089
She's one of New York's finest.

40:17.158 --> 40:18.090
Thank you.

40:18.159 --> 40:19.662
Come on in.

40:22.697 --> 40:24.897
It got ugly at the docks
once you turned around.

40:24.966 --> 40:27.166
You know something I learned
a long time ago, Harlee?

40:27.234 --> 40:30.102
Take care of yourself and
forget about everybody else?

40:30.171 --> 40:34.540
At a certain point,
you gotta stop making enemies.

40:34.609 --> 40:35.841
We didn't ask for this.

40:36.356 --> 40:38.611
It's all we can do to keep
our heads above water.

40:38.679 --> 40:41.513
I threw you a lifeline,
and you decided not to grab it.

40:41.582 --> 40:43.282
It's not my crimes
that are dragging us under.

40:43.351 --> 40:45.184
Once I'm mayor of this city,

40:45.252 --> 40:48.887
those crimes are gonna
benefit everybody.

40:48.956 --> 40:51.023
Greater good justifies
all manner of sins, huh?

40:52.093 --> 40:53.659
Come in.

40:54.762 --> 40:56.228
Ma'am, we gotta walk.

41:17.018 --> 41:18.884
Fill in the blanks, Harlee.

41:18.953 --> 41:21.253
Woz wouldn't get tangled up
with the Feds on his own accord.

41:21.322 --> 41:23.055
So how did it happen?

41:23.124 --> 41:23.956
It just did.

41:24.025 --> 41:26.258
That is not good enough.

41:26.327 --> 41:28.927
You force me to make an enemy tonight.

41:35.970 --> 41:37.936
You know what your problem is, Harlee?

41:38.005 --> 41:39.938
You're sprinting in a marathon.

41:43.844 --> 41:44.743
It's the only way I know.

41:44.812 --> 41:47.312
It won't make for a very long career.

41:47.381 --> 41:49.848
You and I have different priorities.

41:49.917 --> 41:51.316
Well, good luck to you, Harlee.

41:57.058 --> 41:58.023
Get down!

41:59.593 --> 42:01.060
- Shots fired, shots fired!
- Go!
