Grow up! I don't believe you.
Don't you know how to have fun?

09:08.660 --> 09:12.391
Okay, but just for a while. My mom
thinks we're at your house doing homework.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.590
Please!

09:35.420 --> 09:38.856

Thanks, now try to convince my brother
to let me stay for one dance.

10:20.666 --> 10:23.726
Nobody's going to convince me
to do anything. Just go home.

10:24.036 --> 10:26.732
- Bye, Ken.
- Good night, Margarita.

10:32.110 --> 10:33.441

Who doesn't?

12:22.154 --> 12:24.622

12:35.167 --> 12:36.964
Yeah, Rico, go!

13:41.733 --> 13:44.634
Hey, Mom. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

No, thanks. Is Rita home?

13:49.541 --> 13:50.530
Yes.

13:51.409 --> 13:53.741
Try not to be so hard on her.

13:53.812 --> 13:56.781
She needs your love.
Since your father died, it's been...

13:56.848 --> 14:01.251
Mom, I love her. I just worry.
I don't want her hanging out at the club.

14:03.488 --> 14:05.854
So, did you and Vicki clear the floor?

14:07.726 --> 14:09.057
We danced.

14:09.527 --> 14:11.392
I'm tired. Good night.

14:12.964 --> 14:14.431
Good night, <i>mi hijo</i>.

14:54.172 --> 14:55.730
Man, I'm drenched.

14:56.041 --> 15:00.603
Yeah, my dad always said, <i>"</i> Don <i>'</i> t sweat,
unless you <i>'</i> re getting paid for it.<i>"</i>

15:01.646 --> 15:03.136
Are you thinking about him?

15:03.214 --> 15:04.772
- Who?
- Ken.

15:05.617 --> 15:07.209
What do you mean?

15:07.285 --> 15:09.549
I saw how you were looking at him.

15:09.621 --> 15:11.646
No, Ken is just like a brother to me.

15:12.757 --> 15:14.349
Well, he <i>'</i> s not your brother...

15:14.426 --> 15:18.123
and he doesn <i>'</i> t look at you like a brother,
that <i>'</i> s for sure.

15:19.130 --> 15:20.495
He doesn <i>'</i> t?

15:22.200 --> 15:24.361
Does Rico have a girlfriend?

15:24.736 --> 15:26.260
Yeah, sort of. Vicki.

15:29.140 --> 15:32.837
Wait a minute. I hope you don <i>'</i> t
have any plans. Rico <i>'</i> s too old for you.

15:32.911 --> 15:35.937
Are you kidding?
I <i>'</i> ve had older than him before.

15:36.648 --> 15:38.047
You <i>'</i> re so crazy.

15:38.516 --> 15:40.541
I thought you knew me better than that.

15:40.618 --> 15:44.987
Well, yeah, I know my brother.
Rico only likes two things, Rico and salsa.

15:45.690 --> 15:47.021

16:06.244 --> 16:08.474
- Another favor, man?
- Yeah.

16:09.581 --> 16:13.381
I want you to keep Rita busy
while I make a move on her friend.

16:14.819 --> 16:17.379
- Who?
- Lola.

16:19.958 --> 16:23.155
- She <i>'</i> s just a baby, man.

- I don <i>'</i> t like it.
- Come on. <i>Poquito</i>, man, it <i>'</i> s easy.

16:27.799 --> 16:30.495

18:16.774 --> 18:19.470

23:05.029 --> 23:07.896
Come on, tonight <i>'</i> s special.
I want to go. Please?

23:07.999 --> 23:11.025
No, just go home.
You do your homework. Study.

23:12.003 --> 23:14.631
That <i>'</i> s too bad. I <i>'</i> m going to be there.

23:16.340 --> 23:17.432
Please?

23:17.508 --> 23:19.806
- Okay.
- All right.

23:34.058 --> 23:35.252
<i>So</i>

23:45.236 --> 23:47.295
<i>I was feeling</i>

23:48.072 --> 23:49.437
<i>so bad</i>

23:50.775 --> 23:54.006
<i>I asked my family doctor just what I had</i>

23:55.313 --> 23:57.907
<i>- I said, "Doctor"</i>
<i>- "Doctor"</i>

23:57.982 --> 24:00.780
<i>- "Mr. M.D."</i>
<i>- "Doctor"</i>

24:00.852 --> 24:03.412
<i>- "Please tell me"</i>
<i>- "Doctor"</i>

24:03.488 --> 24:06.651
<i>- "What's ailing me"</i>
<i>- "Doctor"</i>

24:11.729 --> 24:13.287
<i>Oh, please</i>

24:13.364 --> 24:16.094
<i>All I really need</i>

24:16.167 --> 24:17.862
<i>Good loving</i>

24:17.935 --> 24:19.926
<i>Good, good, good loving</i>

24:20.004 --> 24:22.336
<i>I want you to give me good loving</i>

24:22.640 --> 24:25.200
<i>Good loving, good loving, good loving</i>

24:50.668 --> 24:52.226
<i>Good loving</i>

25:11.389 --> 25:12.583
<i>Good loving</i>

25:12.657 --> 25:15.125
<i>- All I need from you</i>
<i>- Good loving</i>

25:15.192 --> 25:17.717
<i>- All I want from you</i>
<i>- Good loving</i>

25:17.795 --> 25:20.389
<i>- Is your loving, baby</i>
<i>- Good loving</i>

25:20.865 --> 25:22.127
<i>Good loving, mama</i>

25:29.707 --> 25:31.902
- Hi.
- I have something for you.

25:31.976 --> 25:33.773
- What?
- I have something for you.

25:33.844 --> 25:35.869
- What?
- A birthday present.

25:36.314 --> 25:37.872
My birthday <i>'</i> s not till tomorrow.

25:37.949 --> 25:41.009
I know. But I want you
to have it for tomorrow.

25:45.022 --> 25:46.785
Vicki, wow.

25:49.727 --> 25:51.251
You don <i>'</i> t like it?

25:51.329 --> 25:52.819
I love it.

25:53.130 --> 25:54.961
It <i>'</i> s just... It looks expensive.

25:55.032 --> 25:56.363
Put it on.

25:58.636 --> 26:01.196
Wait, I have something for you, too.

26:06.877 --> 26:08.504
You <i>'</i> re crazy!

26:08.980 --> 26:09.969
Why?

26:10.881 --> 26:12.610
Because I love you.

26:13.784 --> 26:15.581
Come on, put it on.

26:18.422 --> 26:21.357
- It doesn <i>'</i> t fit.
- It fits. Look, right here.

26:21.559 --> 26:23.356
Right there. Try it.

26:25.363 --> 26:26.887
- There.
- There you go.

26:26.964 --> 26:28.693
- Cool!
- There it is.

26:29.367 --> 26:31.232
Come on, let <i>'</i> s go and dance.

26:39.243 --> 26:40.574
<i>Good loving</i>

26:48.586 --> 26:50.520
<i>I want to give you good loving</i>

26:54.091 --> 26:55.388
<i>Give it to me</i>

27:00.665 --> 27:03.566
<i>Oh, please, give it to me</i>

27:03.668 --> 27:06.432
<i>Please</i>

27:06.504 --> 27:08.472
<i>Good, good, good, good loving</i>

27:08.539 --> 27:11.633
<i>I want you to give me good loving</i>

27:27.725 --> 27:30.091
<i>Good, good, good, good loving</i>

27:30.161 --> 27:32.493
<i>Won't you give me good loving?</i>

27:32.830 --> 27:35.094
<i>Good, good, good loving</i>

27:55.720 --> 27:58.484
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Club Luna is proud to present...</i>

27:58.556 --> 28:01.684
<i>from Puerto Rico, the great Tito Puente!</i>

28:07.965 --> 28:10.490
<i>Just a reminder that next week, right here...</i>

28:10.568 --> 28:13.401
<i>we salute</i> El Festival de San Juan.

28:13.471 --> 28:18.272
<i>And just to make the evening more exciting,</i>
<i>Club La Luna will send anyone...</i>

28:18.342 --> 28:21.869
<i>who can clear the floor</i>
<i>to the Grand Salsa Competition...</i>

28:21.946 --> 28:24.073
<i>in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</i>

30:32.610 --> 30:36.637
That kid <i>'</i> s fantastic.
I love the way he handles her on the floor.

30:37.014 --> 30:38.345
He makes her look good.

30:38.415 --> 30:40.940
She doesn <i>'</i> t have any talent,
reminds me of a horse.

30:41.018 --> 30:42.246
What are you saying?

30:42.319 --> 30:46.119
That he would make a great partner
for a woman who knows what she <i>'</i> s doing.

30:46.190 --> 30:47.555
Meaning you?

30:47.625 --> 30:50.116
I have been known
to clear a dance floor in my day.

30:50.194 --> 30:54.722
That <i>'</i> s right. You cleared the dance floor.
No one even looked at your partner.

30:55.099 --> 30:56.794
You still need one, darling.

30:56.867 --> 31:00.166
What are you telling me?
Are you saying you want to dance again?

31:00.237 --> 31:03.138
Or that you want to go to Puerto Rico?

31:03.207 --> 31:06.267
Or that you want to sleep with this kid?

31:08.145 --> 31:10.579
That <i>'</i> s what I love about you, darling.

31:10.648 --> 31:13.640
You fill my head
with so many wonderful ideas.

31:14.652 --> 31:16.517
Bring him to my table.

31:17.354 --> 31:18.981
Anything for you.

31:53.924 --> 31:56.256
You bring wonderful energy to my club.

31:56.327 --> 31:58.488
Thanks. Coming from you,
it <i>'</i> s a compliment.

31:58.562 --> 31:59.688
You <i>'</i> re terrific.

31:59.763 --> 32:03.563
But your partner, she <i>'</i> s not a dancer,
she <i>'</i> s going to need some work.

32:03.634 --> 32:05.295
We <i>'</i> re going to work hard.

32:05.936 --> 32:09.372
You <i>'</i> re welcome to use my club
during the day to rehearse, if you like.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.768
Thanks, we <i>'</i> re gonna need it.
We <i>'</i> re going to Puerto Rico.

32:13.877 --> 32:18.041
The flight doesn <i>'</i> t leave for a few days.
Stay and have some champagne with us.

32:18.115 --> 32:20.549
I think I might have to take a rain check.

32:20.617 --> 32:21.845
Thanks.

32:28.759 --> 32:29.851
Champagne?

32:31.295 --> 32:33.092
- Hi, Rico.
- Hey, Lola.

32:34.598 --> 32:36.225
I <i>'</i> m alone, and you <i>'</i> re alone.

32:36.300 --> 32:39.394
So what do you say we get together
and finish where we left off?

32:39.503 --> 32:42.438
What we started was a mistake.
It was my mistake.

32:42.506 --> 32:44.406
Besides, I <i>'</i> m not alone.

32:45.242 --> 32:48.473
You <i>'</i> re not serious about that girl
you were dancing with, are you?

32:48.545 --> 32:52.311
Yeah, I <i>'</i> m very serious, and I don <i>'</i> t want
any problems. <i>Comprende</i> ?

32:52.383 --> 32:53.714
Are we going?

32:53.784 --> 32:55.945
Yeah. Vicki, this is Lola.

32:56.020 --> 32:59.012
This is Rita <i>'</i> s new friend.
She <i>'</i> s just about to take Rita home.

32:59.089 --> 33:00.750
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:01.392 --> 33:05.590
Listen, tell Rita to tell Mom
I <i>'</i> m over at Vicki <i>'</i> s tonight, okay?

33:06.096 --> 33:07.188
Bye.

33:15.339 --> 33:16.567
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:17.808 --> 33:19.776
Do you have a ride home?

33:21.178 --> 33:22.805
I don <i>'</i> t think so.

33:28.285 --> 33:29.843
I <i>'</i> ll take you home.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.581
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

33:34.091 --> 33:36.321
- How <i>'</i> re you doing back there?
- What?

33:36.393 --> 33:38.361
- How <i>'</i> re you doing?
- I <i>'</i> m fine.

33:38.429 --> 33:39.896
Do you need anything?

33:39.963 --> 33:41.555
- How about ice cream?
- What?

33:41.632 --> 33:43.463
- Ice cream!
- Okay.

34:05.355 --> 34:06.686
- Anything on it?
- No.

34:06.757 --> 34:08.621
- Sure?
- Yeah, I <i>'</i> m sure.

34:16.132 --> 34:18.726
Can I have a vanilla and a chocolate?

35:02.412 --> 35:04.573
- Thanks for the ride.
- I had a great time.

35:04.648 --> 35:07.173
- Really.
- Yeah, I liked it <i>mucho</i>.

35:07.251 --> 35:08.275
What?

35:08.352 --> 35:10.582
- I liked it <i>mucho</i>.
- It <i>'</i> s <i>"mucho gusto."</i>

35:11.722 --> 35:12.950
Well...

35:14.224 --> 35:16.784
- Good night, Margarita.
- Good night.

36:07.010 --> 36:08.272
Come on.

36:09.213 --> 36:11.511
I <i>'</i> ll make you something to eat.

36:12.683 --> 36:14.446
You <i>'</i> re so beautiful.

36:19.890 --> 36:23.587
I <i>'</i> m really happy we <i>'</i> re back together.
I missed you so much.

36:24.261 --> 36:26.252
I <i>'</i> ve missed this place...

36:26.463 --> 36:27.953
and the mutt.

36:30.133 --> 36:32.431
What <i>'</i> s wrong? You <i>'</i> re shivering.

36:35.305 --> 36:37.330
After tonight...

36:37.774 --> 36:39.173
I <i>'</i> m afraid.

36:40.577 --> 36:42.875
The stakes are too high, and...

36:45.882 --> 36:47.782
You could go to Puerto Rico.

36:47.851 --> 36:50.149
I don <i>'</i> t want
to get in the way of your dreams.

36:50.220 --> 36:52.188
Vicki, you are my dream.

36:52.656 --> 36:53.680
Can <i>'</i> t you...

36:53.757 --> 36:57.784
Haven <i>'</i> t you noticed how
people look at us when we dance together?

36:57.861 --> 36:59.761
They <i>'</i> re looking at you.

37:00.030 --> 37:02.498
No, Vicki, they <i>'</i> re looking at you.

37:06.403 --> 37:07.427
I mean...

37:07.504 --> 37:09.972
relax, we <i>'</i> ll go to Puerto Rico.

37:10.440 --> 37:11.702
Positive.

37:11.808 --> 37:13.799
How could you be so sure?

37:14.711 --> 37:17.703
Well, if I told you,
you would probably laugh.

37:17.781 --> 37:19.248
No, I won <i>'</i> t.

37:19.316 --> 37:20.476
Yes, you would.

37:20.550 --> 37:21.983
No, I won <i>'</i> t.

37:22.052 --> 37:23.576
It <i>'</i> s important.

37:25.555 --> 37:29.616
Well, when I was a little kid,
my Dad would always say:

37:30.427 --> 37:33.260
<i>"</i> Rico, I <i>'</i> m going to take you to Puerto Rico.<i>"</i>

37:33.430 --> 37:35.864
You know, he <i>'</i> d show me pictures...

37:36.366 --> 37:38.163
he <i>'</i> d talk about it...

37:38.869 --> 37:40.496
and then he died.

37:41.738 --> 37:45.265
But right now, I feel like he <i>'</i> s so close,
he <i>'</i> s with us.

37:45.342 --> 37:47.003
He <i>'</i> s hugging us.

37:47.110 --> 37:50.705
He <i>'</i> s happy we <i>'</i> re together again,
he <i>'</i> s happy for the family.

37:50.814 --> 37:53.374
He says we <i>'</i> re going to clear that floor...

37:53.450 --> 37:55.748
and we <i>'</i> re going to Puerto Rico.

37:58.822 --> 38:00.687
What else does he say?

38:00.957 --> 38:02.049
What?

38:02.726 --> 38:04.023
About us.

38:04.094 --> 38:06.392
The future, kids.

38:06.463 --> 38:09.364
Gee, let me give him a call. I don <i>'</i> t know.

38:11.234 --> 38:15.034
He says, we <i>'</i> ll have two...
No, maybe we <i>'</i> ll have five.

38:15.639 --> 38:18.164
Five kids. They <i>'</i> re all going to dance.

38:19.743 --> 38:21.574
They <i>'</i> re all going to dance.

38:21.645 --> 38:25.911
They <i>'</i> ll go on tour, make lots of money,
make a lot of people happy.

38:25.982 --> 38:28.576
And then we <i>'</i> ll retire in Puerto Rico.

38:28.752 --> 38:31.516
- You have a one-track mind.
- No.

38:35.158 --> 38:36.716
It <i>'</i> s almost time.

38:37.627 --> 38:40.494
I <i>'</i> ll go inside,
and I <i>'</i> ll get something to celebrate with.

38:40.564 --> 38:41.963
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:05.722 --> 39:09.522
<i>Each night, I pray</i>
<i>there would soon come a day</i>

39:09.593 --> 39:13.222
<i>That I'd find my way back to your shore</i>

39:13.296 --> 39:16.424
<i>Somehow I knew, if I reach you</i>

39:16.500 --> 39:18.866
<i>It's there that my heart will stay</i>

39:18.935 --> 39:21.062
<i>Forever more</i>

39:21.138 --> 39:23.003
<i>High on the dream</i>

39:23.073 --> 39:25.132
<i>I'm still believing</i>

39:25.208 --> 39:27.108
<i>Say you'll be mine</i>

39:28.345 --> 39:30.575
<i>My Puerto Rico</i>

39:42.793 --> 39:46.456
<i>How can it be</i>
<i>that your heart beats in me?</i>

39:47.097 --> 39:50.328
<i>I keep hearing your song in my mind</i>

39:51.601 --> 39:53.034
<i>How did I know</i>

39:53.103 --> 39:56.869
<i>It was Puerto Rico that's been calling me</i>

39:57.040 --> 39:59.702
<i>All of the time?</i>

40:00.277 --> 40:04.646
<i>I close my eyes, I am in paradise</i>

40:04.714 --> 40:07.410
<i>Say you'll be there</i>

40:07.684 --> 40:09.914
<i>My Puerto Rico</i>

40:09.986 --> 40:12.386
<i>Hold me tonight, under the stars</i>

40:12.456 --> 40:14.481
<i>Puerto Rico</i>

40:14.558 --> 40:16.719
<i>Where I belong, there in your arms</i>

40:16.793 --> 40:18.954
<i>Puerto Rico</i>

40:23.133 --> 40:25.431
<i>Every beat, I feel the heat</i>

40:25.502 --> 40:27.060
<i>Puerto Rico</i>

40:31.908 --> 40:34.240
<i>Every step, closer I get</i>

40:34.311 --> 40:36.142
<i>Puerto Rico</i>

40:39.716 --> 40:44.710
<i>I'm coming home to you</i>

41:32.335 --> 41:33.427
Rico?

41:37.607 --> 41:40.405
Vicki! Welcome to Puerto Rico!

41:41.377 --> 41:43.641
<i>Silencio</i> everybody! Rico <i>'</i> s here!

41:43.713 --> 41:45.112
Please, everybody.

41:45.181 --> 41:47.115
- Go on, girls.
- Told you.

41:47.183 --> 41:49.913
- Well, let <i>'</i> s go back to your place.
- No.

41:49.986 --> 41:52.580
Come on, then tell me what we <i>'</i> re doing.

41:52.655 --> 41:53.849
Chuey <i>'</i> s around here.

41:53.923 --> 41:55.982
- No, he <i>'</i> s not.
- Yes, he is.

41:56.526 --> 41:58.687
- Aunt Rosie <i>'</i> s here, she <i>'</i> s cooking.
- No.

41:58.762 --> 42:01.663
Where are we? At home?
Tell me where we <i>'</i> re at.

42:02.031 --> 42:04.465
Come on. Please?

42:08.371 --> 42:10.601
- Come on.
- Happy birthday, <i>mi hijo</i>.

42:10.673 --> 42:12.766
Surprise!

42:43.072 --> 42:44.334
Yo, Rico!

42:46.376 --> 42:48.139
Happy birthday, man.

43:16.639 --> 43:19.472
Can you move in a little bit? Here we go.

44:39.255 --> 44:40.620
Puerto Rico.

44:55.571 --> 44:57.095
I love you, Ma.

46:36.773 --> 46:40.869
- Listen to me! I told you no. You <i>'</i> re drunk!
- I <i>'</i> m not drunk. I <i>'</i> m happy.

46:46.215 --> 46:48.342
Vicki, I didn <i>'</i> t do anything.

47:16.946 --> 47:20.040
Wherever Rico is, you are never far off...

47:20.116 --> 47:21.640
like a faithful dog.

47:22.552 --> 47:24.713
Lay off, Lola. You <i>'</i> re drunk.

47:28.291 --> 47:31.283
But everybody knows
he doesn <i>'</i> t care about you anymore.

47:31.360 --> 47:32.827
Lola, don <i>'</i> t cause a scene.

47:32.895 --> 47:35.386
This is Rico <i>'</i> s party.
He deserves a good time.

47:35.465 --> 47:38.195
I already showed him the good time.
Didn <i>'</i> t he tell you?

47:40.837 --> 47:43.135
This is better than <i>Miami Vice</i>!

47:49.679 --> 47:53.513
- Vicki, what <i>'</i> s wrong?
- Time you opened your birthday presents.

47:57.720 --> 48:00.689
- Lola. Come on, honey. Come on.
- Is she okay?

48:00.756 --> 48:03.884
- Yeah, Mom, she <i>'</i> ll be okay.
- She just had a bit too much to drink.

48:03.960 --> 48:06.428
- Take her to the house, Rico.
- Give her some air!

48:06.496 --> 48:09.260
There <i>'</i> s nothing wrong!
There <i>'</i> s plenty of food! Let <i>'</i> s go!

48:09.332 --> 48:12.199
- Who turned off the music?
- Bang those drums!

48:19.175 --> 48:22.440
- Where are we going?
- Just calm down. You <i>'</i> ll be okay.

48:23.913 --> 48:25.642
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

48:30.119 --> 48:33.919
Come on, stop it, okay?
There <i>'</i> s a house full of people.

48:33.990 --> 48:36.117
I can <i>'</i> t help it. You excite me.

48:36.192 --> 48:38.717
Come on, Lola!
I just came in here to help you.

48:38.794 --> 48:41.160
Here, I <i>'</i> ll show you how you can help me.

48:41.230 --> 48:42.857
Get off me, Lola.

48:52.275 --> 48:53.742
I said stop, Lola.

48:53.809 --> 48:55.868
Come on, Rico, let <i>'</i> s do it.

48:59.048 --> 49:00.174
Is she in there?

49:00.249 --> 49:01.273
- Who?
- Lola.

49:01.350 --> 49:02.977
- No.
- No?

49:03.052 --> 49:04.747
No. Guess what?

49:04.820 --> 49:07.220
Your mom asked me to go get some beer.

49:07.290 --> 49:09.087
- Want to come with me?
- Now?

49:09.158 --> 49:11.319
- Yeah, now.
- Okay.

49:44.860 --> 49:46.088
Come on.

49:54.804 --> 49:55.793
Please?

50:00.876 --> 50:03.811
Come on, Ken, let <i>'</i> s just give them one beer.

50:08.818 --> 50:11.116
Happy New Year! Happy birthday.

50:11.454 --> 50:14.184
Hey, fellas,
take your hands off the girl right now.

50:21.330 --> 50:23.355
All right, take it easy, fellas.

50:27.536 --> 50:29.731
- Margarita.
- Margarita!

50:37.079 --> 50:38.637
<i>Margarita</i>

50:56.932 --> 50:58.331
<i>Margarita</i>

51:06.842 --> 51:08.707
Come on, please?

51:12.682 --> 51:14.741
- Come on.
- Come on.

51:35.971 --> 51:37.962
Hey, where are you going?

51:40.976 --> 51:43.410
<i>And our love goes on forever</i>

51:45.414 --> 51:49.214
<i>When I'm with you, I'm not well</i>

51:50.386 --> 51:52.684
<i>Margarita</i>

51:53.989 --> 51:56.457
<i>I will search until I find you</i>

51:58.127 --> 52:00.459
<i>And the roses will remind me</i>

52:02.331 --> 52:05.892
<i>And I will wake inside the dream</i>

52:10.206 --> 52:12.231
<i>The sun in her hair</i>

52:12.341 --> 52:14.332
<i>The tropical air</i>

52:14.443 --> 52:16.434
<i>The smell of the sea</i>

52:16.879 --> 52:18.813
<i>The girl next to me</i>

52:18.914 --> 52:20.643
<i>She's got the touch</i>

52:20.716 --> 52:22.684
<i>That I need oh so much</i>

52:22.752 --> 52:24.379
<i>My</i> muchachita

52:27.289 --> 52:29.416
<i>It's more than her eyes</i>

52:29.658 --> 52:31.626
<i>More than her voice</i>

52:31.794 --> 52:33.728
<i>More than her smile</i>

52:33.796 --> 52:35.991
<i>That leaves you no choice</i>

52:36.132 --> 52:39.659
<i>Straight from the pages of love</i>
<i>she was born</i>

52:39.769 --> 52:41.862
<i>Margarita</i>

52:44.106 --> 52:47.633
<i>And if I could get back to that dream</i>

52:48.611 --> 52:51.011
<i>I know she'll be there</i>

52:51.080 --> 52:52.638
<i>Waiting for me</i>

52:52.715 --> 52:53.977
<i>Margarita</i>

52:55.751 --> 52:58.083
<i>I will search until I find you</i>

52:59.989 --> 53:02.583
<i>And the roses will remind you</i>

53:04.226 --> 53:07.127
<i>I will wake inside the dream</i>

53:25.481 --> 53:26.505
What?

53:28.250 --> 53:31.276
Come on, fellas, we have to go.
I gave you all my beer.

53:31.387 --> 53:34.823
This is how you <i>'</i> re going to treat me?
She <i>'</i> s a young girl. We have...

53:36.859 --> 53:38.724
<i>Margarita</i>

53:39.295 --> 53:40.626
Beautiful!

54:18.367 --> 54:21.097
Mind if I interrupt
with some constructive criticism?

54:21.170 --> 54:24.139
- Of course not.
- It <i>'</i> s the crossover step.

54:24.707 --> 54:27.471
I <i>'</i> ve seen that danced
a thousand times like that.

54:27.543 --> 54:30.740
- I can show you a much better way.
- Sure.

54:32.781 --> 54:34.180
Cross over.

54:35.384 --> 54:38.148
And again.

54:38.654 --> 54:40.281
Second position.

54:41.123 --> 54:44.490
- I don <i>'</i> t understand.
- Open your legs.

54:45.094 --> 54:46.288
Deeper.

54:47.763 --> 54:50.288
Now hold me strong. And stand tall.

54:54.270 --> 54:56.204
- All right.
- Open break!

54:58.908 --> 55:01.900
Now that <i>'</i> s the way
that step should be danced!

55:04.113 --> 55:06.673
- Want to see some more?
- Sure.

55:08.617 --> 55:10.949
I understand you like to travel.

55:11.120 --> 55:13.145
- I sure do.
- Then let <i>'</i> s go.

55:39.782 --> 55:41.579
Imagine how he feels.

55:43.519 --> 55:45.612
He <i>'</i> s dancing with the best.

55:47.756 --> 55:50.657
- You care a lot about him, don <i>'</i> t you?
- Yeah.

55:51.794 --> 55:53.421
Well, I love her.

55:54.196 --> 55:56.630
I would do anything for her.

55:57.933 --> 56:01.835
So, what are you trying to say?
Why don <i>'</i> t you get to the point?

56:02.237 --> 56:04.262
What I <i>'</i> m trying to say...

56:04.373 --> 56:08.104
is that if you love someone,
you don <i>'</i> t stand in their way.

56:08.644 --> 56:10.703
Luna wants to dance again.

56:11.280 --> 56:13.578
And Rico <i>'</i> s her perfect partner.

56:16.385 --> 56:17.750
Let him go.

56:20.055 --> 56:22.546
Whatever it takes, just let him go.

56:39.808 --> 56:41.935
- Where are you going?
- I <i>'</i> m going home.

56:42.011 --> 56:44.036
What do you mean? We have to rehearse.

56:44.113 --> 56:46.513
No, you have to rehearse, not me.

56:46.949 --> 56:48.473
Vicki, what <i>'</i> s wrong?

56:48.584 --> 56:51.109
Dancing with you is wrong.
Being with you is wrong.

56:51.186 --> 56:54.246
Now you have a new partner,
the Queen of Salsa.

56:54.556 --> 56:56.820
She was just showing us a few steps.

56:56.892 --> 56:59.258
A few steps? You were swept away.

56:59.328 --> 57:01.922
I saw you.
I was left there, standing like a jerk.

57:02.031 --> 57:03.191
Come on, Vicki.

57:03.265 --> 57:06.666
No, but it <i>'</i> s okay. She <i>'</i> s a fucking
better dancer than me anyway.

57:06.735 --> 57:08.532
Yeah, but I love you.

57:08.637 --> 57:11.197
No, you don <i>'</i> t. You love your dreams.

57:11.273 --> 57:14.265
And she is your ticket
to Puerto Rico, not me.

58:14.403 --> 58:17.531
- You know, you <i>'</i> re never home anymore.
- Jealous?

58:17.906 --> 58:21.171
Listen, I want you home,
in bed, by 10:00 on school nights.

58:21.243 --> 58:23.074
- Who died and made you king?
- What?

58:23.145 --> 58:26.637
- Don <i>'</i> t tell me what to do.
- Don <i>'</i> t talk back, and don <i>'</i> t test me.

58:26.715 --> 58:28.478
Just do what I said.

58:30.486 --> 58:31.885
Yes, Your Majesty.

58:34.890 --> 58:37.222
- What <i>'</i> s going on here?
- Nothing.

58:39.128 --> 58:42.689
- Is this going to become a regular routine?
- Yes.

59:52.167 --> 59:53.657
I <i>'</i> m buying it.

59:56.138 --> 59:59.596
- I want a popcorn.
- Don <i>'</i> t put any butter, unless it <i>'</i> s free.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.534
- Hey, Rita.
- God, you scared me.

01:00:26.602 --> 01:00:28.536
Know what time it is?

01:00:28.604 --> 01:00:31.732
- I was with a friend, her car broke down.
- I don <i>'</i> t believe that.

01:00:31.807 --> 01:00:33.672
Rico, why don <i>'</i> t you get off my back?

01:00:33.742 --> 01:00:36.233
Did your slut friend
introduce you to someone?

01:00:36.311 --> 01:00:38.279
You should know about my slut friend.

01:00:38.347 --> 01:00:42.044
Since you been hanging around Lola,
you been turning into some kind of <i>puta</i>!

01:00:42.117 --> 01:00:43.607
Don <i>'</i> t call me <i>puta</i>, <i>cabr√≥n</i>.

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:46.313
Hey, stop it! Both of you.

01:00:47.189 --> 01:00:49.657
- God, I hate you.
- Yeah? You <i>'</i> re grounded.

01:00:57.499 --> 01:00:59.490
I don <i>'</i> t know you anymore.

01:00:59.801 --> 01:01:02.235
My son would never hit his sister.

01:01:02.638 --> 01:01:04.970
My boy would never strike a woman.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.531
If you sneer,
you <i>'</i> re not acting like my son anymore.

01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:10.601
You <i>'</i> re acting
like some big, punk, macho shit.

01:01:23.425 --> 01:01:26.087
I won <i>'</i> t ask you where you <i>'</i> ve been,
because I trust you.

01:01:26.161 --> 01:01:28.288
But you should have called.

01:01:28.897 --> 01:01:30.228
Yeah, Mom.

01:01:32.401 --> 01:01:33.993
Baby, remember...

01:01:34.369 --> 01:01:36.963
with my job, we eat and pay the rent.

01:01:37.639 --> 01:01:41.769
It was your brother who, on his own,
took that job at the garage, fixing cars...

01:01:42.144 --> 01:01:44.544
so that we could all live better.

01:01:45.147 --> 01:01:48.913
So, when he gets upset with you,
you must be more patient.

01:01:49.785 --> 01:01:51.252
He loves you.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.586
He <i>'</i> s growing up so fast...

01:01:54.656 --> 01:01:57.648
but, in so many ways, he <i>'</i> s just a little boy.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.758
Try to understand, Margarita...

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:04.858
the way I understand about you and Ken.

01:02:09.938 --> 01:02:11.269
It <i>'</i> s okay.

01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:30.117
I want to talk to you about something.

01:02:30.459 --> 01:02:32.552
I want to talk to you, too.

01:02:32.728 --> 01:02:33.922
You first.

01:02:34.529 --> 01:02:36.053
It <i>'</i> s Rita, man.

01:02:39.034 --> 01:02:40.558
What about her?

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:43.835
I <i>'</i> m worried, you know?

01:02:44.473 --> 01:02:45.872
Is she okay?

01:02:47.242 --> 01:02:51.008
She <i>'</i> s been coming home late,
she <i>'</i> s not doing well in school.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.008
She doesn <i>'</i> t eat right.
It <i>'</i> s just a lot of shit, you know?

01:02:55.083 --> 01:02:57.210
Maybe she <i>'</i> s just growing up.

01:02:57.519 --> 01:02:59.384
No, I think it <i>'</i> s Lola.

01:02:59.488 --> 01:03:02.548
I <i>'</i> ll bet you anything
she set her up with someone.

01:03:03.558 --> 01:03:05.423
Maybe he <i>'</i> s a nice guy.

01:03:05.494 --> 01:03:09.055
Well, maybe we should go
and find out who this nice guy is.

01:03:10.065 --> 01:03:12.397
- Why?
- So we can kick his ass.

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:17.330
We <i>'</i> ve got to take care of our kid sister.

01:03:17.406 --> 01:03:20.637
You <i>'</i> re going to help out, right?
I mean, we are <i>familia</i>, bro.

01:03:22.377 --> 01:03:25.210
- So, what were you going to say?
- Nothing.

01:04:23.105 --> 01:04:24.834
What are you doing?

01:04:25.607 --> 01:04:28.269
- I <i>'</i> m doing my best...
- I don <i>'</i> t like it when you do that.

01:04:28.343 --> 01:04:31.938
- My best?
- No, the knee drop. It <i>'</i> s amateurish.

01:04:32.781 --> 01:04:36.114
I figured, if you were spinning,
I <i>'</i> d, you know, solo.

01:04:36.184 --> 01:04:38.584
Solo? To me, that <i>'</i> s not the salsa.

01:04:39.287 --> 01:04:41.551
To me, what you do isn <i>'</i> t salsa, either.

01:04:41.623 --> 01:04:45.423
I don <i>'</i> t have time for this.
Just follow my skirt, little boy.

01:04:53.602 --> 01:04:55.934
We need a little reality check here.

01:04:56.004 --> 01:04:58.131
This is not <i>The Rico Show</i>.

01:04:58.206 --> 01:05:02.267
You are the frame,
and I am the picture, got it?

01:05:02.344 --> 01:05:04.005
Now, let <i>'</i> s dance.

01:05:06.214 --> 01:05:09.047
You <i>'</i> re taking things too personally, Rico.

01:05:16.525 --> 01:05:17.719
Sorry.

01:05:27.669 --> 01:05:31.571
You think you <i>'</i> re going to get
to Puerto Rico dancing like that?

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:35.501
If I do this once, on my own, it <i>'</i> ll be okay.

01:05:36.278 --> 01:05:39.441
You make me feel insecure.
I just have to work on it.

01:05:40.148 --> 01:05:43.948
San Juan is 4,000 miles away.
You <i>'</i> ve got 3,800 more to go.

01:05:44.653 --> 01:05:45.642
Orlando.

01:05:56.131 --> 01:05:58.292
Don <i>'</i> t worry about it. She likes you.

01:06:33.301 --> 01:06:34.427
Rita.

01:06:39.808 --> 01:06:40.832
Hi.

01:06:54.155 --> 01:06:57.056
I don <i>'</i> t want to keep this a secret anymore.

01:06:57.392 --> 01:06:59.292
I tried to tell Rico...

01:07:00.161 --> 01:07:01.992
but it <i>'</i> ll kill him.

01:07:03.565 --> 01:07:05.430
I love the both of you.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.594
I love my brother,
but he can <i>'</i> t come between us.

01:07:10.038 --> 01:07:13.337
It <i>'</i> ll be fine, Margarita. Don <i>'</i> t worry.

01:07:41.469 --> 01:07:45.599
- We weren <i>'</i> t doing anything.
- Just shut up, and get in the house.

01:07:46.107 --> 01:07:47.597
It <i>'</i> s not her fault.

01:07:54.316 --> 01:07:55.908
Go ahead, go in.

01:07:56.251 --> 01:07:58.151
- Don <i>'</i> t touch my sister.
- I love her.

01:07:58.219 --> 01:07:59.846
You love her ass!

01:08:00.488 --> 01:08:01.682
That <i>'</i> s not it, bro.

01:08:01.756 --> 01:08:05.192
Don <i>'</i> t call me <i>"</i> bro,<i>"</i> man.
It <i>'</i> s been you all this time.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:08.195
You dumb Puerto Rican.
You just don <i>'</i> t get it.

01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:11.524
Don <i>'</i> t! You <i>'</i> re going to kill him! Stop!

01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:17.729
Please, stop, don <i>'</i> t.

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:20.839
He didn <i>'</i> t do anything! Please! Stop!

01:08:21.009 --> 01:08:22.567
Don <i>'</i> t, please.

01:08:23.845 --> 01:08:27.144
Don <i>'</i> t, you <i>'</i> re going to kill him!
We didn <i>'</i> t do anything.

01:08:32.354 --> 01:08:35.187
Stop, please! Why don <i>'</i> t you let him go?

01:08:35.924 --> 01:08:38.620
I worked my ass off
to make a better future for Rita...

01:08:38.693 --> 01:08:41.594
and she <i>'</i> s throwing it away
because of you, you piece of shit!

01:08:41.662 --> 01:08:43.358
What is she throwing away, man?

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:47.629
Man, you betrayed us. <i>La familia.</i>
We took you in when you had no one.

01:08:47.769 --> 01:08:49.532
What are you saying?

01:08:50.572 --> 01:08:52.005
You know what I <i>'</i> m saying?

01:08:52.073 --> 01:08:55.406
If I ever catch you here around my sister,
I <i>'</i> m going to kill you, man.

01:08:55.477 --> 01:08:57.536
- Come on.
- No, let me go!

01:08:58.179 --> 01:08:59.407
Come on.

01:09:49.096 --> 01:09:50.758
See you tomorrow.

01:09:51.966 --> 01:09:52.990
Bye.

01:10:11.319 --> 01:10:13.719
Hi. God, you look so awful.

01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:17.818
We have to talk.

01:10:18.326 --> 01:10:19.554
About what?

01:10:22.063 --> 01:10:23.655
It <i>'</i> s got to end.

01:10:24.065 --> 01:10:25.692
What do you mean?

01:10:26.734 --> 01:10:28.634
I mean, the both of us.

01:10:29.704 --> 01:10:31.763
It <i>'</i> s not right between us.

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:35.675
Look, Rita, you have to go to school
and be someone.

01:10:35.743 --> 01:10:38.644
I am someone,
someone I thought you cared about.

01:10:38.713 --> 01:10:41.079
If I didn <i>'</i> t care,
I wouldn <i>'</i> t be here saying this.

01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:43.947
I wish things could be the way they were.

01:10:49.424 --> 01:10:50.823
I love you.

01:12:04.599 --> 01:12:06.829
What the hell <i>'</i> s going on with you?

01:12:06.901 --> 01:12:10.166
- I <i>'</i> d never drop you.
- I wish you would drop me...

01:12:10.238 --> 01:12:13.537
if it meant that you <i>'</i> d get
your move right for once.

01:12:14.943 --> 01:12:17.741
Maybe we <i>'</i> d get something
more exciting going on here...

01:12:17.812 --> 01:12:19.712
something more dynamic.

01:12:30.124 --> 01:12:33.355
Damn it. Listen, I <i>'</i> m sorry.
I can <i>'</i> t concentrate.

01:12:33.428 --> 01:12:37.592
- I <i>'</i> ve got a lot of things on my mind.
- I don <i>'</i> t care about your personal problems.

01:12:37.665 --> 01:12:40.031
Your problems don <i>'</i> t belong
on my dance floor.

01:12:40.101 --> 01:12:41.932
This is my last night to rehearse.

01:12:42.003 --> 01:12:44.995
The festival is tomorrow,
and it <i>'</i> s your ass on the line, baby.

01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:47.064
No, it <i>'</i> s your ass on the line, okay?

01:12:47.141 --> 01:12:49.974
Because this is your last chance
to be the Queen of Salsa.

01:12:50.044 --> 01:12:52.672
Just who the hell
do you think you <i>'</i> re talking to?

01:12:52.747 --> 01:12:57.047
I earned every bit of that title,
and I earned every square inch of this club...

01:12:57.118 --> 01:13:00.144
and nobody gave it to me,
I had to work for it.

01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:01.619
I don <i>'</i> t understand you.

01:13:01.689 --> 01:13:05.056
I <i>'</i> m giving you the world on a platter,
you little shit.

01:13:05.593 --> 01:13:09.359
I thought your girlfriend
didn <i>'</i> t know how to dance, but I was wrong.

01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:10.419
It <i>'</i> s you.

01:13:10.498 --> 01:13:12.830
No timing, no concentration.

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.300
What is it with you? You just don <i>'</i> t care?

01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:18.100
If I have to back-lead you
all over this dance floor...

01:13:18.172 --> 01:13:21.630
I promise you,
I am going to make an impression.

01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:25.770
I am going to clear that dance floor,
even if it <i>'</i> s with your ass.

01:13:25.847 --> 01:13:27.508
Now, you got that?

01:14:21.769 --> 01:14:22.861
Yeah?

01:14:31.846 --> 01:14:35.247
- It <i>'</i> s nothing, Ma.
- Something <i>'</i> s wrong. I want to know.

01:14:35.316 --> 01:14:39.013
Ma, there <i>'</i> s nothing wrong.
I just want to be alone. Please.

01:14:43.958 --> 01:14:46.859
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, Mom, I <i>'</i> m sure.

01:14:49.163 --> 01:14:52.223
Are you nervous
about the dance tomorrow night?

01:14:55.603 --> 01:14:57.161
Good night.

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.396
You better be careful.
Your brother is already here.

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:06.133
- What brother?
- Very funny. I <i>'</i> m serious.

01:16:06.207 --> 01:16:08.767
He sees you dressed like that, he <i>'</i> ll go crazy.

01:16:08.843 --> 01:16:11.869
Crazy? Good.
This is a night he <i>'</i> s never going to forget.

01:16:11.946 --> 01:16:14.915
- Come on. Let <i>'</i> s dance.
- I am scared of you.

01:16:15.283 --> 01:16:16.409
<i>Girls</i>

01:16:16.484 --> 01:16:18.611
<i>Say what they wanna say</i>

01:16:19.153 --> 01:16:20.211
<i>Boys</i>

01:16:20.288 --> 01:16:22.756
<i>Look at them anyway</i>

01:16:22.824 --> 01:16:23.791
<i>Girls</i>

01:16:23.858 --> 01:16:26.827
<i>They're always acting shy</i>

01:16:26.894 --> 01:16:27.883
<i>Boys</i>

01:16:27.962 --> 01:16:30.692
<i>You know the reason why</i>

01:16:30.765 --> 01:16:31.663
<i>Girls</i>

01:16:31.732 --> 01:16:34.064
<i>They like to play with you</i>

01:16:34.202 --> 01:16:35.191
<i>Boys</i>

01:16:35.269 --> 01:16:37.794
<i>They like to party, too</i>

01:16:38.272 --> 01:16:40.240
<i>Some girls do, some girls don't</i>

01:16:40.308 --> 01:16:41.536
<i>Some girls will</i>

01:16:41.609 --> 01:16:43.543
<i>Go all the way</i>

01:16:46.113 --> 01:16:47.978
<i>Some girls will, some girls won't</i>

01:16:48.049 --> 01:16:49.516
<i>Some girls don't</i>

01:16:53.888 --> 01:16:55.856
<i>Dance the night away</i>

01:17:01.329 --> 01:17:03.854
<i>Party every day</i>

01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:11.168
Why is he dancing like that?
He <i>'</i> ll wear himself out.

01:17:11.239 --> 01:17:12.263
Relax.

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.002
I can <i>'</i> t. He <i>'</i> s supposed to be
saving that stuff for me.

01:17:15.076 --> 01:17:17.601
Don <i>'</i> t worry about it.
He <i>'</i> s warming himself up for you.

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.512
<i>Boys</i>

01:17:27.588 --> 01:17:30.182
<i>They think they are macho men</i>

01:17:30.258 --> 01:17:31.247
<i>Girls</i>

01:17:31.325 --> 01:17:33.657
<i>Well, they don't give a damn for</i>

01:17:33.861 --> 01:17:34.828
<i>Boys</i>

01:17:34.896 --> 01:17:37.296
<i>They seem to care</i>

01:17:37.365 --> 01:17:38.992
<i>But girls</i>

01:17:39.066 --> 01:17:41.227
<i>In sexy underwear</i>

01:17:41.736 --> 01:17:42.760
<i>Boys</i>

01:17:42.837 --> 01:17:45.067
<i>Are always in demand</i>

01:17:45.573 --> 01:17:46.699
<i>Girls</i>

01:17:46.774 --> 01:17:49.436
<i>Will never understand why</i>

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:50.442
<i>Boys</i>

01:17:50.511 --> 01:17:53.309
<i>Don't want to take a chance with</i>

01:17:53.381 --> 01:17:54.439
<i>Girls</i>

01:17:54.515 --> 01:17:57.177
<i>Who only wanna dance</i>

01:17:57.251 --> 01:17:59.048
<i>Some girls do, some girls don't</i>

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.348
<i>Some girls will</i>

01:18:00.421 --> 01:18:02.889
<i>Go all the way</i>

01:18:04.825 --> 01:18:06.725
<i>Some girls will and some girls won't</i>

01:18:06.794 --> 01:18:08.284
<i>Some girls don't</i>

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.591
<i>Dance the night away</i>

01:18:20.241 --> 01:18:22.505
<i>Party every day</i>

01:19:31.245 --> 01:19:33.179
<i>Some girls do, some girls don't</i>

01:19:33.247 --> 01:19:34.339
<i>Some girls will</i>

01:19:34.415 --> 01:19:37.407
<i>Go all the way</i>

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:40.920
<i>Some girls will and some girls won't</i>

01:19:40.988 --> 01:19:41.977
<i>Some girls don't</i>

01:20:05.346 --> 01:20:07.075
What are you doing here?

01:20:07.148 --> 01:20:09.912
Are you jealous
they <i>'</i> ll be looking at me instead of you?

01:20:09.984 --> 01:20:11.815
Besides, I came to watch you lose.

01:20:11.886 --> 01:20:13.854
Quit acting like a cheap whore, okay?

01:20:13.921 --> 01:20:16.355
Is that what you want? I <i>'</i> ll act like a whore.

01:20:16.424 --> 01:20:18.688
You <i>'</i> re embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

01:20:18.759 --> 01:20:22.490
Friends? Where <i>'</i> s Vicki? Where <i>'</i> s Kenny?
It <i>'</i> s always Rico.

01:20:24.965 --> 01:20:26.933
This is the last time I <i>'</i> ll tell you.

01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:29.196
Are you going to hit me, like you hit Ken?

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:32.296
He never loved you.
I told him to baby-sit you.

01:20:35.476 --> 01:20:39.674
- Where the hell is he going? Stop him.
- Let him cool off. He <i>'</i> ll be back.

01:21:22.089 --> 01:21:23.716
How is she, Rico?

01:21:23.958 --> 01:21:25.755
Just get out of here.

01:21:26.527 --> 01:21:29.155
- I said, how is she, man?
- Mind your own business.

01:21:29.230 --> 01:21:31.289
You know this is all your fault, right?

01:21:31.365 --> 01:21:34.801
You know, just get out of here.
Leave my family alone!

01:21:35.836 --> 01:21:37.360
She <i>'</i> s going to be all right.

01:21:37.438 --> 01:21:40.930
She <i>'</i> s a little shaken, some light contusions,
but she <i>'</i> s one lucky girl.

01:21:41.008 --> 01:21:44.273
- Are you Ken? She keeps asking for Ken.
- That <i>'</i> s me.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:49.615
- Rico, wait a second.
- Just go to hell, okay?

01:22:14.542 --> 01:22:15.566
Hi.

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.652
How do you feel?

01:22:34.795 --> 01:22:38.754
Okay. I <i>'</i> m so happy to see you.
I missed you so much.

01:22:39.667 --> 01:22:41.294
I missed you, too.

01:22:41.635 --> 01:22:43.899
- Where <i>'</i> s Rico?
- Rico? He <i>'</i> s gone.

01:22:45.072 --> 01:22:46.369
Gone where?

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:50.069
I don <i>'</i> t know. He took off. I tried to stop him.

01:22:50.711 --> 01:22:53.339
This is all my fault. This is because of me.

01:22:53.414 --> 01:22:55.905
No, it <i>'</i> s not. Rico has a lot of problems.

01:22:56.884 --> 01:22:58.977
I hope he went to the club.

01:22:59.186 --> 01:23:00.744
I don <i>'</i> t think so.

01:23:01.322 --> 01:23:02.687
He was pretty crazy.

01:23:03.023 --> 01:23:06.322
Rico has to go to the club.
He has to dance tonight.

01:23:06.694 --> 01:23:09.822
I know my brother.
He <i>'</i> s going to do something crazy.

01:23:09.897 --> 01:23:11.728
You have to find him.

01:23:16.003 --> 01:23:17.197
Please?

01:23:24.745 --> 01:23:27.145
I think I might know where he is.

01:23:28.582 --> 01:23:30.482
Let <i>'</i> s get out of here.

01:25:14.321 --> 01:25:16.414
Remember when we got these?

01:25:19.126 --> 01:25:20.889
We were just kids.

01:25:21.795 --> 01:25:23.387
Summer vacation.

01:25:23.997 --> 01:25:27.626
You wanted to be blood brothers,
but I was afraid of blood.

01:25:27.701 --> 01:25:31.000
So I bought us
these St. Christopher medals instead.

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:37.401
Who <i>'</i> d ever think, after all these years,
we <i>'</i> d still be wearing them?

01:25:41.615 --> 01:25:44.846
You know, even when you
ripped this off my neck...

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.920
you didn <i>'</i> t rip it out of me, bro.

01:25:51.525 --> 01:25:54.619
I know you don <i>'</i> t think of me
like that anymore.

01:25:54.962 --> 01:25:56.623
But you <i>'</i> re my bro.

01:25:57.898 --> 01:26:00.332
You <i>'</i> re the only family I ever had.

01:26:02.603 --> 01:26:04.503
I know I hurt you, man...

01:26:07.508 --> 01:26:08.998
and I <i>'</i> m sorry.

01:26:12.713 --> 01:26:15.773
Just know, I <i>'</i> d do anything for the <i>familia</i>.

01:26:18.118 --> 01:26:20.143
Just know, I love you, man.

01:26:23.857 --> 01:26:25.848
I <i>'</i> ll get you another one.

01:26:26.493 --> 01:26:27.585
What?

01:26:31.465 --> 01:26:34.457
I <i>'</i> ll get you another chain, man.
A strong one.

01:27:14.908 --> 01:27:16.398
I <i>'</i> ll be over there.

01:27:23.116 --> 01:27:25.141
Great timing, you asshole.

01:27:25.586 --> 01:27:26.917
Time this.

01:27:41.702 --> 01:27:43.226
Shall we salsa?

01:32:05.065 --> 01:32:08.694
<i>Each night I pray</i>
<i>There would soon come a day</i>

01:32:08.802 --> 01:32:12.260
<i>That I'd find my way</i>
<i>back to your shore</i>

01:32:13.707 --> 01:32:16.699
<i>Somehow I knew if I reached you</i>

01:32:16.777 --> 01:32:19.211
<i>it's there that my heart will stay</i>

01:32:19.379 --> 01:32:21.745
<i>Forever more</i>

01:32:22.582 --> 01:32:26.951
<i>High on the dream</i>
<i>I'm still believing</i>

01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:29.853
<i>Say you'll be mine</i>

01:32:30.023 --> 01:32:32.321
<i>My Puerto Rico</i>

01:32:32.392 --> 01:32:34.690
<i>Hold me tonight under the stars</i>

01:32:34.761 --> 01:32:36.752
<i>Puerto Rico</i>

01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:39.128
<i>Where I belong, there in your arms</i>

01:32:39.199 --> 01:32:41.064
<i>Puerto Rico</i>

01:32:42.369 --> 01:32:43.836
I missed you.

01:33:02.989 --> 01:33:07.153
<i>Now I know Puerto Rico has been calling me</i>

01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:15.099
<i>I close my eyes, I am in paradise</i>

01:33:15.168 --> 01:33:18.137
<i>Say you'll be there</i>

01:33:18.205 --> 01:33:20.571
<i>My Puerto Rico</i>

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.835
<i>Hold me tonight under the stars</i>

01:33:22.909 --> 01:33:24.877
<i>Puerto Rico</i>

01:33:24.945 --> 01:33:27.243
<i>Where I belong, there in your arms</i>

01:33:27.314 --> 01:33:29.179
<i>Puerto Rico</i>

01:33:33.653 --> 01:33:36.019
<i>Every step, closer I get</i>
