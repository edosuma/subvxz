07:40.293 --> 07:42.712
I swore I'd always
have his back.

07:42.753 --> 07:46.382
Then he made me vow to never
give up on Landon, which is

07:46.424 --> 07:48.676
before the truth about him
hiding the ascendant came out.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.387
Now that it has...

07:51.429 --> 07:54.182
It seems you cannot keep one vow
without breaking the other.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.850
Boom.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.520
So... unless there's some
third option I'm not seeing,

07:59.562 --> 08:03.107

one thing is clear.

You certainly put the "ass"
in "astral projection."

you a message,

08:49.695 --> 08:52.198
You've astral projected
here before.

A message.

09:08.839 --> 09:11.300
But it's not
there anymore.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.593
Maybe a gargoyle
ate it?

could be anywhere.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.684
Not really.

09:19.725 --> 09:23.896
Every day in a prison world
is the same day, right?

09:23.938 --> 09:27.817
Which means the wind
always does the same thing.

Landon is, exactly?

11:18.094 --> 11:19.762
We don't know.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.597
Once we are
physically in the prison world,

11:21.639 --> 11:23.391
then we can do
a locator spell.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.975
WADE:
In a world
with hungry monsters

11:25.017 --> 11:26.977
trying to tear us
limb from limb,

11:27.019 --> 11:29.939
I probably look like
a hot dog to them.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.899
ALARIC:
I agree with all of you,
for a change.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.235
Which is why this
incredibly dangerous mission

11:34.276 --> 11:37.780
has to be conducted on a
purely voluntary basis.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.616
MG, I think we know
where you stand.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.076
HOPE:
Enough talk.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.661
Who's with me?

11:46.122 --> 11:48.582
You know I'm not.

11:48.624 --> 11:52.336
So please, at least let me
try to explain why.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.299
I get that you're pissed.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.926
And I apologize

11:58.968 --> 12:01.137
for breaking your trust.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.722
But you also know me,

12:02.763 --> 12:05.266
and you know there's nothing
I wouldn't do

12:05.307 --> 12:07.059
for you

12:07.101 --> 12:09.478
or anyone at this school,
even Jed.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.855
So why do you think

12:10.896 --> 12:13.190
I've been lying this whole time?

12:13.232 --> 12:15.401
Lizzie and I astral
projected into this world.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.987
I've seen its horrors
with my own eyes.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.780
If we open a
door to it,

12:19.822 --> 12:22.074
we could be marching right
into one of Malivore's traps.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.119
Or worse, giving him
exactly what he wants.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.455
A way into our world.
HOPE: What Malivore wants

12:27.496 --> 12:28.456
is Landon.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.874
Always has, always will.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.042
Which is why we need
a better plan.

12:32.084 --> 12:37.715
Otherwise, we will be trading
a life of someone here for him.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.967
Why do you think
we all fought

12:40.009 --> 12:42.470
so hard to lock Malivore away
in the first place, Hope?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.848
We can't screw that up.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.268
And if Landon were here, I'm
sure that he'd agree with me.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.145
Well, he's not. And
if you were trapped,

12:51.187 --> 12:53.481
he'd risk his life
to save you.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.566
That goes for any of you.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.818
MG:
I'm not saying

12:57.860 --> 13:00.321
we shouldn't go after Landon.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.698
We just have to be
smart about it.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.451
And what you're talking
about right now,

13:05.493 --> 13:06.827
it's not smart.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.829
It's desperate.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.875
I know I'm not the leader
of the Super Squad,

13:12.917 --> 13:15.294
but I did lead
the fight

13:15.336 --> 13:17.713
that saved this school
from Triad.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.757
And it's my plan
that put Malivore

13:19.799 --> 13:21.050
where he's at right now.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.885

traversing dimensional planes.

who didn't know anything

14:07.179 --> 14:09.598
about this stuff before
you got here, you're a...

14:09.640 --> 14:10.933
you're a quick study.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.519
What you got?

Meet Charon,
the ferryman of Greek myth.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.524
Pay his bounty,

14:18.566 --> 14:20.734
and he will carry your soul
across the River Styx.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.112
He sounds dope, if you're dead.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.655
We're trying to bring
Landon back alive.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.074
Perhaps we can,
for the right price.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.286
Just not how the portal
or the Malivore monsters work.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.037
You can't just go ordering up
any creature you want

14:32.079 --> 14:33.247
like it's takeout.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.915
Have you tried?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.918
Then how can you be certain?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.670
Surely there are
spells which exist

14:39.712 --> 14:41.964
to summon
what you consider monsters.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.924
Yeah, that's black magic.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.384
And while that
would absolutely be

14:45.426 --> 14:46.802
an amazing name for our band,

14:46.844 --> 14:48.679
it's not really
how we do it around here.

14:48.721 --> 14:52.516
In my belief,
magic is neither good or bad.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.144
Its alignment,
positive or negative,

14:55.185 --> 14:57.605
is set off by the
user's intention.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.650
So I guess that's
how you intend to help me

15:01.692 --> 15:04.653
with my vows--
plural-- to MG.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.656
And remind Hope
that my intentions towards her

15:07.698 --> 15:09.867
have always been good.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.077
I'm still not convinced
MG's were.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.832
I understand you are angry
with your friend,

15:16.874 --> 15:19.919
but saving Landon
will require action.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.005
You cannot be
Switzerland forever.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.677
Um, speaking of action,

15:28.719 --> 15:30.304
Super Squad meeting
started about ten minutes ago,

15:30.346 --> 15:31.639
so I got to...

15:34.141 --> 15:37.353
(sighs) I'll think on it.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.063
I promise.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.235
ALARIC:
Malivore's not the only threat

15:45.277 --> 15:46.946
we need to worry about.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.031
Let's not forget,
The Necromancer is trapped

15:49.073 --> 15:50.658
inside the prison world as well,

15:50.699 --> 15:52.493
and he is notorious
for holding a grudge.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.328
I wish we had more time,

15:54.370 --> 15:56.121
but these planets aren't
gonna wait for us, so if we're

15:56.163 --> 15:58.040
gonna do this, we need to
get prepared immediately.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.167
Which means you all need
to make the decision

16:00.209 --> 16:01.627
that's right for you.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.256
Sorry I'm late.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.257
I miss anything
important?

16:07.299 --> 16:08.592
No, you're just in time.

16:08.634 --> 16:09.718
Are you coming with us
to the prison world

16:09.760 --> 16:11.762
to save Landon or not?
Uh...

16:11.804 --> 16:13.514
Where's MG?
ALARIC:
He's not joining us,

16:13.555 --> 16:15.307
here or there.

16:16.684 --> 16:20.479
So, if I go, I'm just
doing him dirty like he did us.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.023
And if I stay, I'm still
screwing him over.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.775
And Landon.
Sounds like a no.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.652
Moving on. Wade?

16:27.778 --> 16:29.571
Well, as a general rule,

16:29.613 --> 16:31.156
I tend to avoid
situations

16:31.198 --> 16:33.826
that will probably lead
to my untimely demise,

16:33.867 --> 16:35.452
but Gaby and I

16:35.494 --> 16:37.746
really need a DM
for our next campaign,

16:37.788 --> 16:40.040
and-and Landon's the only one
that's any good at it.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.002
S-So, yeah, I'm-I'm Team Hope.

sport makes us incompatible.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.275
Yeah, I'm seeing that.

Because the only
thing we can agree on

17:50.110 --> 17:52.821

to go on a date.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.401
Well, it's a hot spot

21:17.442 --> 21:19.403
and has a perfect view
of the celestial event.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.446
I know Lizzie was just trying
to protect me this morning,

21:21.488 --> 21:23.073
but I'm glad
she came around.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.868
Where is she?

21:26.910 --> 21:29.162
Currently, probably pissed at me

21:29.204 --> 21:32.708
for going behind her back
and dragging you into this,

21:32.749 --> 21:34.584
even after she explicitly
told me not to.

21:34.626 --> 21:38.588
So you lied about Lizzie coming
and now Finch is mad at me, too?

21:38.630 --> 21:41.049
I mean, I didn't really
have a choice.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.759
Lizzie bailed on me

21:42.801 --> 21:44.720
and you're the only other
Gemini witch I know.

21:44.761 --> 21:48.598
Yeah, in theory. Except I don't
have my magic and you know that.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.225
Which sucks,

21:50.267 --> 21:52.060
because a love potion
is about the only way

21:52.102 --> 21:53.478
that Finch is ever
gonna talk to me again.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.064
What if I could fix it?

21:57.774 --> 22:00.360
I mean, not you
and Finch, but...

22:00.402 --> 22:02.112
your magic.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.909
If you take it back,
we can save Landon.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.287
KALEB:
I know I was trippin'...

22:11.747 --> 22:13.457
...but turns out
there was no need.

22:13.498 --> 22:17.419
Lizzie put the kibosh
on Hope's rescue mission

22:17.461 --> 22:19.087
for about another month, so,

22:19.129 --> 22:20.881
all you and I got to
worry about now is that whole

22:20.922 --> 22:22.632
"getting to know each other"
part.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.554
Cleo. What the hell?

22:27.596 --> 22:29.431
You all right?
Yes.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.517
That took far more out of me
than I expected.

22:32.559 --> 22:35.979
I don't like the sound of that.

The last time I had magic...
I'm just

23:40.627 --> 23:42.879
willing to bet that you're
stronger than the darkness.

23:42.921 --> 23:45.090

Yeah, but what if you're wrong?

out of the darkness

Without magic,

24:18.665 --> 24:21.501
monsters or drama.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.670
Those things are
a part of you, Jo.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.256
They always will be.
You can't run from them.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.301
I could guilt-trip you
about the fact that

24:29.342 --> 24:30.969
your walk on the dark side
led to the creation

24:31.011 --> 24:33.221
of this prison world and
Landon being trapped there...

24:33.263 --> 24:35.724
Which you kind of just did.
...but no one feels

24:35.765 --> 24:38.185
more guilty about what happened
to him than I do.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.520
So I'd rather just
focus on the good,

24:40.562 --> 24:44.024
because that's
the Josie Saltzman that I know.

24:46.359 --> 24:47.861
Thank you.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.282
I just miss him.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.367
I hate the position that
I'm putting you in, but...

24:54.409 --> 24:55.869
You don't need
to keep talking.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.748
I've made my decision.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.293
KALEB:
You don't have to worry about
the whole Josie thing.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.003
Okay? Because we're gonna
get Landon back

25:05.045 --> 25:08.590
in the land of the living before
Hope can say "abracadabra."

25:08.632 --> 25:10.383
You two captured this thing?

25:10.425 --> 25:12.886
KALEB:
Uh, yeah.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.638
More or less.

25:16.973 --> 25:18.475
Well, let's start with the more.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.560
Uh...
I summoned it,

25:20.602 --> 25:21.770
Dr. Saltzman.
No, look, look,

25:21.811 --> 25:23.188
before you freak out,

25:23.230 --> 25:24.648
you said that you wanted us
to catch a monster

25:24.689 --> 25:26.149
to try to get some
more answers, right?

25:26.191 --> 25:27.651
This one does more than that.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.152
In theory.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.779
But it will
not accept money

25:30.820 --> 25:33.615
in exchange for Landon's soul,
as we expected,

25:33.657 --> 25:36.451
so we are in need
of your expertise.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.789
Well, I'm a little rusty
when it comes

25:40.830 --> 25:43.291
to psychopomps, but I think
I know what it wants.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.335
Go get some of Landon's
personal items.

25:45.377 --> 25:49.464
It'll need some of those to
identify his soul or whatever.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.966
Nerd stuff. Copy that.
We're on it.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.384
Oh, and, uh, Cleo?

25:52.425 --> 25:53.760
Next time you want
to summon a monster,

25:53.802 --> 25:54.844
just ask for permission
first, okay?

25:54.886 --> 25:56.263
Now get moving.

25:56.304 --> 25:58.181
We're running
out of time.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.732

26:07.774 --> 26:10.360
I got to say,
a road trip was a great idea.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.987
So, you gonna tell me
where we're headed?

26:12.028 --> 26:14.406
(gas nozzle clunks)
Um...

26:14.447 --> 26:17.367
West. W-We need to go west.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.035
MG:
I guess it doesn't matter
as long as we keep moving.

26:19.077 --> 26:22.664
You gonna show me
what's on your mind?

26:22.706 --> 26:25.166
It's a surprise. Let's
just get back on the road.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.751
Lizzie, wait.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.795
There's something
I need to say before we do.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.506
It might be cheesy,

26:31.548 --> 26:34.092
you'll probably make fun of me
for this later,

26:34.134 --> 26:37.512
but you're my person,
Lizzie Saltzman.

26:37.554 --> 26:41.266
You always have been
and you always will be.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.268
I know.
But I didn't know

26:43.310 --> 26:45.478
that you had my back
the same way.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.188
Not until today.

26:47.230 --> 26:50.442
So I just wanted
to say thank you,

26:50.483 --> 26:54.112
because I truly understand
just how much that means.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.531
Can I just get a rain check
on this conversation?

26:57.741 --> 27:00.201
I have so many things that
I want to explain to you,

27:00.243 --> 27:04.456
and I regret all the times
that I let you down

27:04.497 --> 27:07.417
or made you feel used.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.045
And I promise that

27:10.086 --> 27:12.714
I'm gonna try really, really
hard not to do it ever again.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.552
Starting first thing
in the morning.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.640
(grunts) Why are you doing this?

27:21.681 --> 27:23.975
Because Hope has Josie.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.518
And we both know that

27:25.560 --> 27:27.604
she won't stop
until she gets the ascendant.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.607
So I'm sorry,

27:30.649 --> 27:33.985
but if it's the only way
to save my sister, I'm...
