WEBVTT

00:16.010 --> 00:17.753
Evening, Mr. Eames.

00:19.096 --> 00:21.765
I already told you boys. Call me Reggie.

00:21.890 --> 00:22.970
Reggie it is.

00:24.184 --> 00:26.307
You gonna invite us in, Reggie?

00:26.437 --> 00:28.346
Maybe you boys could
come back tomorrow.

00:28.480 --> 00:29.512
My babies are sleeping in there.

00:29.648 --> 00:31.107
You know what?
We ain't here to talk to your babies.

00:32.818 --> 00:34.941
What y'all got in that bag?

00:35.279 --> 00:37.355
What is in that bag?

00:37.489 --> 00:39.612
The good news is, Reggie,

00:39.742 --> 00:43.276
if you do the right thing, you won't
have to find out what's in the bag.

00:43.412 --> 00:44.823
Hello, Dick.

00:46.248 --> 00:47.363
Well, how about that?

00:48.375 --> 00:52.587
If it ain't Mr. Boyd Crowder hisself.
La-di-da.

00:53.839 --> 00:56.045
What are you boys up to now?

00:58.385 --> 01:00.010
You got yourself some business
up here, Boyd?

01:00.137 --> 01:02.011
Same as you, I'd wager,

01:03.098 --> 01:05.055
except, of course, mine's legitimate.

01:05.184 --> 01:09.098
I tell you what. Reggie, why don't
you go ahead and tell Black Pike,

01:09.229 --> 01:13.726
"No, thank you, not interested,"
and send Mr. Crowder here on his way?

01:13.859 --> 01:15.899
Mr. Eames is gonna hear out our offer,

01:16.945 --> 01:19.483
and then he's gonna
make his own decision.

01:19.615 --> 01:21.738
Listen, boys, I'm just trying to do
what's best by my family.

01:21.867 --> 01:23.030
That's what you should do.

01:23.535 --> 01:26.406
- You should do what's best for your family.
- Tomorrow morning,

01:26.538 --> 01:28.163
we will be back.

01:29.416 --> 01:31.872
That's right. And your signature,

01:32.419 --> 01:33.450
Reggie,

01:34.213 --> 01:36.039
we will be expecting.

01:36.840 --> 01:40.423
- You boys have a good night.
- Thank you so much. Come on, Coov.

01:41.804 --> 01:43.962
<i>We will be back</i>

01:44.807 --> 01:46.846
<i>We will be back</i>

01:47.476 --> 01:50.679
You sign the land over to Black Pike, there
won't be anything they can do about it.

01:51.647 --> 01:52.845
Yeah, not anything legal.

01:52.981 --> 01:54.891
Well, I can provide protection for you
and your family,

01:55.025 --> 01:56.685
provided that you agree to our terms.

01:56.819 --> 01:57.850
And if I don't?

01:58.487 --> 02:00.230
Those boys will be back,
and chances are,

02:00.364 --> 02:03.733
you're gonna find out
what's inside that duffel bag.

02:05.410 --> 02:08.198
I'm sure you'll make the right decision.

02:39.987 --> 02:41.814
You're dropping your shoulder.

02:44.867 --> 02:46.859
- No, I ain't.
- Maybe you're not.

02:47.452 --> 02:48.995
I never played any baseball.

02:49.121 --> 02:50.235
How'd you find me here?

02:50.914 --> 02:52.622
Tracked your phone.

02:53.208 --> 02:55.580
- Tracked my phone?
- Yeah, I called you a few times.

02:55.711 --> 02:59.459
You didn't answer, so I tracked your phone.
It's not like landing on the moon.

03:00.507 --> 03:01.788
What for?

03:01.925 --> 03:05.626
Carol Johnson,
that spokesperson for the coal mine.

03:05.762 --> 03:07.636
Seemed like a bit of a ball buster.

03:07.764 --> 03:09.971
You're going down to Harlan
to be her security detail.

03:11.143 --> 03:14.144
- You guys need to be wearing a helmet.
- I'm not hitting.

03:14.855 --> 03:16.017
What are you doing
in the batting cage, then?

03:16.148 --> 03:18.022
Yeah, I couldn't find one that fit.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.561
Well, then you wear one that don't.

03:19.693 --> 03:21.899
Okay. Sorry about that.

03:22.029 --> 03:25.563
The threat assessment identified
Judge Reardon as the probable target.

03:25.699 --> 03:27.407
Seriously, guys, read the sign,

03:27.993 --> 03:30.910
"No spikes, no seeds,
no helmet, no hitting."

03:31.038 --> 03:34.870
Nothing about "no beating
the shit out of a teenager," though.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.578
I guess that'd be okay, then.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.619
Hey, I'll call the cops.

03:38.754 --> 03:40.581
Kid, we are the cops.

03:42.674 --> 03:45.165
I guess you should know
how to obey the law, then.

03:48.055 --> 03:49.928
Pick her up at her hotel at 8:00 a.m.

03:50.057 --> 03:52.049
Take her down to Harlan
to that town meeting.

03:52.184 --> 03:53.892
Unless she asks you a direct question,

03:54.019 --> 03:56.771
you keep your coal-miner-loving
mouth shut. You got it?

03:57.731 --> 03:59.011
I got it.

04:00.984 --> 04:02.063
Time's up.

04:32.266 --> 04:33.546
He knows.

04:35.727 --> 04:36.890
What?

04:37.896 --> 04:39.390
Art, he knows.

04:40.857 --> 04:42.435
What did he say?

04:44.069 --> 04:45.647
What did he say?

04:46.113 --> 04:47.940
He didn't say nothing.

04:48.323 --> 04:51.490
- Well, then, how do you know...
- I can just tell. He knows.

04:54.788 --> 04:55.986
Can he prove it?

04:56.415 --> 05:01.622
I suppose he could poke around,
check the records, figure it out.

05:02.254 --> 05:04.496
Well, is he gonna turn us in?

05:06.133 --> 05:07.960
I would if I was him.

05:14.850 --> 05:16.677
What are we gonna do?

06:27.005 --> 06:30.754
Boyd, I'm gonna need to see
your license and registration.

06:30.884 --> 06:32.877
Is there a problem here, Nicky?

06:33.011 --> 06:34.968
I pulled you over
'cause of your busted taillight.

06:35.097 --> 06:37.303
- What busted taillight?
- This busted taillight.

06:40.852 --> 06:42.726
Doyle send you boys to find me?

06:42.854 --> 06:45.262
I don't know what you mean.
But you add to that busted taillight

06:45.399 --> 06:49.610
the fact that you failed to produce
a valid license or registration card,

06:50.278 --> 06:51.393
well, we got ourselves
a bit of a problem here.

06:51.530 --> 06:55.610
You tell Doyle and his brothers, if they
want to talk to me, they know where I am.

06:55.742 --> 07:00.369
But right now, I'm gonna take
my things, and I'm gonna go.

07:01.248 --> 07:02.825
I'm gonna need you to step out
of this vehicle, Boyd.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.575
I ain't gonna ask you again.

07:23.103 --> 07:25.309
Can we please turn that off?

07:28.525 --> 07:30.149
You know, when I requested you, I...

07:30.277 --> 07:33.278
- Requested me?
- Yeah. When I requested you,

07:33.405 --> 07:37.866
I was told you were a stud US Marshal.
But all you seem to me is hung over.

07:38.493 --> 07:43.036
Well, anybody tries anything, I got
both hands free with which to shoot.

07:43.915 --> 07:46.241
And you can see them from underneath
the brim of that hat, can you?

07:46.376 --> 07:48.369
Eyes on the road, please.

07:50.255 --> 07:53.339
I also was told you were brave.
Is that true?

07:54.801 --> 07:57.126
I try to be whatever's required.

07:58.346 --> 08:00.256
So, if this suspect of yours...

08:00.390 --> 08:02.217
- Kirby Jr.?
- Yeah. Kirby Jr.

08:02.350 --> 08:04.592
Same guy who called
in the courthouse bomb threat.

08:04.728 --> 08:08.263
That's right. If he... If he tries to kill
me, would you give your life to save mine?

08:08.398 --> 08:14.519
Miss Johnson, if I'm dead and gone to
heaven, how do I know I saved your life?

08:15.697 --> 08:19.232
Raylan, wouldn't heaven know
if you saved my life?

08:20.368 --> 08:21.697
You got me.

08:22.454 --> 08:23.829
This is Carol Johnson.

08:23.955 --> 08:25.699
Are you familiar with
the hands-free law?

08:25.832 --> 08:29.664
Will you just pipe down?
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

08:32.297 --> 08:37.173
What in the hell happened?
Are you kidding me? For the love...

08:37.302 --> 08:39.508
All right. No, no, no. You know what?
I don't even want to hear it.

08:39.638 --> 08:41.844
Just never mind.
Tell me when we get there.

08:43.225 --> 08:47.518
It sounded like the kind of call
someone gets from someone in jail.

08:47.646 --> 08:49.971
Very good, Marshal.

08:50.106 --> 08:51.649
So, who we gonna bail out?

08:56.571 --> 09:00.521
Well, it occurs to me that you were there
to greet me the last time I got out of jail.

09:00.659 --> 09:03.529
Well, I won't be there the next time.
I can guarantee you that.

09:03.870 --> 09:06.492
What makes you think
there's gonna be a next time, Raylan?

09:06.623 --> 09:08.912
You arrest another of my employees
on some trumped-up bullshit,

09:09.042 --> 09:10.951
we'll sue you for harassment!
You hear me?

09:11.086 --> 09:14.668
You all go poking the bear,
and it's his fault when you get bit.

09:14.798 --> 09:16.506
I'm sorry. Are you talking back there
about something?

09:16.633 --> 09:18.044
Excuse me, ma'am?

09:18.552 --> 09:19.583
Miss Johnson.

09:19.928 --> 09:23.760
Yes. Doyle Bennett,
just the man I'd like to talk to.

09:23.890 --> 09:24.921
Boyd...

09:26.476 --> 09:28.682
You keep some pretty
notorious company.

09:28.812 --> 09:32.975
Not nearly as notorious as the corrupt
chief of the Bennett Police Department.

09:33.108 --> 09:35.563
Well, if you're referring to the arrest
of Mr. Crowder, you should know

09:35.694 --> 09:38.398
that he has an extensive history
of criminal behaviour.

09:38.530 --> 09:40.688
And a busted taillight is the best
you could come up with?

09:40.824 --> 09:44.193
You should be more careful
about the people you hire.

09:44.327 --> 09:45.786
I think Raylan would
agree with me on that.

09:45.912 --> 09:50.159
Oh, no. You can go ahead
and leave me out of it.

09:50.292 --> 09:52.368
That's the role
of the new, modern lawman,

09:52.502 --> 09:55.705
just stand by
and watch corruption go unchecked?

09:55.839 --> 09:58.875
Well, he's right. Boyd here is shady.

10:00.176 --> 10:02.881
Of course, he isn't any worse than you,
Doyle, is he?

10:03.013 --> 10:05.848
Or your company's
mountaintop agenda, Carol.

10:06.266 --> 10:08.389
As far as I'm concerned,
y'all deserve each other.

10:08.518 --> 10:13.180
And whenever this shit does blow up
in your faces, guess what,

10:13.732 --> 10:15.440
I won't be here to clean up the bodies.

10:15.567 --> 10:17.394
You all have a good day, now.

10:17.527 --> 10:19.318
I'll be in the car.

10:22.741 --> 10:24.151
Did you at least get
Reggie Eames' signature?

10:24.284 --> 10:26.276
Well, I got it this morning,
but I had it in the truck with me

10:26.411 --> 10:27.442
when they pulled me over.

10:27.579 --> 10:30.070
Then you're just gonna have
to go back out and get it again.

10:30.206 --> 10:31.617
This was a warning.

10:31.750 --> 10:35.534
Next time, Doyle and his boys
won't bother with some bullshit arrest.

10:35.670 --> 10:38.920
You just keep doing
what you're being paid to do.

10:39.382 --> 10:42.169
If lines must be crossed, Miss Johnson,

10:42.927 --> 10:45.881
how do I know that
you're gonna have my back?

10:46.014 --> 10:49.846
I just bailed you out of jail, and I'm
about to get your car out of hock.

10:49.976 --> 10:54.306
Take those as gestures of my goodwill
towards your role in our cause.

11:03.365 --> 11:05.441
That was quite a speech
you made in there.

11:05.575 --> 11:08.031
Well, thank you.
I stayed up all night working on it.

11:08.161 --> 11:11.032
That whole part at the end about you
not being around to clean up the bodies,

11:11.164 --> 11:15.031
were you just being figurative,
or are you planning on leaving us?

11:15.168 --> 11:17.125
I can't remember.

11:17.253 --> 11:19.163
What's the matter, Raylan?
You seem a bit agitated.

11:19.297 --> 11:20.626
Do you get along with her?

11:20.757 --> 11:24.090
Maybe you're just feeling some anxiety
about our current situation.

11:24.219 --> 11:25.417
What situation would that be?

11:25.553 --> 11:29.088
Well, now, more than once we've found
ourselves on the same side of a fight.

11:29.224 --> 11:32.593
Okay. Well, I'm on assignment
by the federal government.

11:32.727 --> 11:35.479
You're a hired gun thug
for a crooked company.

11:35.605 --> 11:39.437
Now, the only thing that we're
on the same side of is, like, this car.

11:43.822 --> 11:46.941
Well, if you need anything, Raylan,
you let me know.

11:51.913 --> 11:56.374
Miss Johnson, tell me again. In your
head, what's about to happen here?

11:56.501 --> 12:00.084
Just gonna clear the air,
have a nice, calm conversation.

12:00.213 --> 12:01.791
Nothing clear about
the air around coal.

12:07.053 --> 12:10.220
- Do you know these people?
- I know of them. You?

12:10.724 --> 12:12.467
Well, you could say we
have some history.

12:12.976 --> 12:15.549
Is that gonna be a problem, Marshal?

12:16.229 --> 12:17.557
No, ma'am.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.185
Ms. Bennett.

12:21.860 --> 12:23.235
I don't believe we've formally met.

12:23.361 --> 12:25.852
I'm Carol Johnson
with the Black Pike Mining company.

12:25.989 --> 12:28.195
I know who you are, Miss Johnson.

12:28.324 --> 12:31.658
Much prettier in person
than you are in the papers.

12:31.786 --> 12:34.906
I'm surprised to see you here
with her, Raylan.

12:35.331 --> 12:38.119
Marshals Service duty.
There have been some threats.

12:38.251 --> 12:40.540
Well, that's just awful.

12:40.795 --> 12:42.076
Part of the job, I suppose.

12:42.213 --> 12:44.704
Yeah, it's not easy being a
strong woman. Take it from me.

12:45.341 --> 12:49.007
But you just keep doing what you're
doing. Don't let them see you sweat.

12:50.722 --> 12:54.387
Miss Johnson, these are my boys,
Dickie and Coover.

12:54.517 --> 12:56.177
- Hello.
- Hey!

12:57.854 --> 12:59.763
So, what brings you out this way?

13:00.607 --> 13:03.442
Need some travel soap?
Toothbrush, maybe?

13:03.777 --> 13:05.734
I'm here to talk business.

13:05.862 --> 13:08.318
Even with the law within earshot?

13:08.448 --> 13:11.733
Black Pike is all aboveboard.
No need for secrecy.

13:12.452 --> 13:13.863
Everything I have to say on the matter

13:13.995 --> 13:16.616
you'll hear tonight
at that fancy meeting you're holding.

13:16.748 --> 13:19.417
Well, I'm very glad to hear that
you're gonna be coming,

13:19.542 --> 13:25.912
but I was hoping to talk to you before
then, sort out our conflicting interests.

13:26.633 --> 13:29.799
And by "conflicting interests,"
I'm assuming you mean that Black Pike

13:29.928 --> 13:32.134
wants to rape our hollers
and I want to save them?

13:32.263 --> 13:33.343
No, that's not what I meant.

13:33.473 --> 13:36.842
I've already made it clear that
you will hear my position tonight.

13:37.852 --> 13:40.011
- Nice to meet you.
- Ma'am.

13:47.028 --> 13:50.693
You whoring for the mines now, too,
like your buddy Boyd?

13:50.824 --> 13:55.284
Coover, you touch me again,
it's gonna be a problem.

13:56.663 --> 13:58.490
I ain't afraid of you, Marshal.

14:00.792 --> 14:04.706
It's nice to see the work you done
on your boys' self-esteem has paid off.

14:06.047 --> 14:08.455
Coover, be careful, now.

14:08.591 --> 14:11.925
You go beating on a federal,
it can take years from you.

14:57.432 --> 15:00.717
Boys, let's go, now. That's enough.
You hear me?

15:01.227 --> 15:02.342
Coover, that's enough.

15:05.773 --> 15:07.232
Stop it. Stop it.

15:07.984 --> 15:10.142
Stop it! Stop it!

15:12.989 --> 15:14.068
Come on. Let's go.

15:30.381 --> 15:32.006
You ain't gonna wear that
to the meeting, are you?

15:32.508 --> 15:34.003
I just need five more minutes.

15:34.177 --> 15:36.004
- I'll come back.
- That's not what I meant.

15:39.265 --> 15:41.174
So, what was that all about today?

15:41.309 --> 15:43.432
Well, a little bad blood.

15:43.561 --> 15:47.808
Bad blood? Geez. What,
like Hatfield-and-McCoy bad blood?

15:48.650 --> 15:49.895
A little bit.

15:50.026 --> 15:51.271
Do tell.

15:51.861 --> 15:56.190
Well, I guess it goes back
to during Prohibition,

15:56.324 --> 16:00.737
the Bennetts were running moonshine across
the state line, and agents busted them.

16:01.537 --> 16:05.487
They got it in their heads
it was a Givens tipped off the feds.

16:05.625 --> 16:08.910
My Great-Uncle Harold took a bullet
to the chest,

16:09.587 --> 16:11.414
and back and forth it went.

16:11.547 --> 16:14.085
I guess for me it started
at a baseball game.

16:14.550 --> 16:15.630
Baseball game?

16:15.760 --> 16:20.718
Yeah, high school. I was playing for Evarts.
Dickie was pitching for Bennett.

16:21.683 --> 16:24.886
I had already gotten two hits
off of him, and...

16:28.272 --> 16:29.352
Finish your story.

16:29.482 --> 16:31.938
I'm sorry. Where was I?

16:32.360 --> 16:34.399
- Two hits.
- Yes. Two hits.

16:35.571 --> 16:37.694
So, I come up a third time,

16:38.574 --> 16:43.949
and Dickie's first pitch was just Linda
Ronstadt. You know? Just <i>Blue Bayou.</i>

16:44.914 --> 16:48.283
The second pitch I got a hold of,
but it went foul.

16:49.168 --> 16:52.454
And the third pitch
Dickie put right into my head.

16:53.172 --> 16:56.791
I hit the dirt. When I looked up,
the benches had cleared,

16:56.926 --> 17:00.971
and Dickie was pulling his foot back,
put his cleats in my face.

17:01.806 --> 17:04.048
And I just picked up the bat,

17:05.268 --> 17:07.391
swung it, got my third hit.

17:09.439 --> 17:12.522
Made his left leg bend
sideways at the knee.

17:13.358 --> 17:14.521
That accounts for that limp.

17:14.652 --> 17:16.526
- Givens.
<i>- State police just found</i>

17:16.654 --> 17:20.319
a car registered to Kirby Jr. abandoned
in a motel parking lot

17:20.450 --> 17:21.992
along Route 75,

17:22.410 --> 17:25.944
<i>50 miles outside of Harlan.
You hear me?</i>

17:26.079 --> 17:27.872
Yeah. No, I heard you.

17:27.999 --> 17:31.083
If Kirby Jr.'s on his way down there
and taking those kinds of precautions,

17:31.210 --> 17:32.870
could be after Carol.

17:33.004 --> 17:34.332
<i>The meeting starts in about an hour.</i>

17:34.464 --> 17:37.085
Do you want us to send some help
down there?

17:37.216 --> 17:40.632
None of you would get here in
time, anyway. I can handle it.

17:40.762 --> 17:43.597
<i>- Watch your back, okay?</i>
- Okay. Thank you.

17:46.100 --> 17:51.011
This threat level's been elevated.
You should reschedule this meeting.

17:51.481 --> 17:54.185
No, no. It'll look like
I'm afraid to face them.

17:54.317 --> 17:58.231
Well, perhaps your safety is more
important than how it looks.

17:58.613 --> 18:00.522
We're not cancelling.

18:00.656 --> 18:04.820
Raylan, you may be an idiot
and you're certainly a pain in my ass,

18:05.870 --> 18:07.827
but we're going to the meeting.

18:07.955 --> 18:09.450
It's not safe.

18:10.208 --> 18:14.371
Well, then, you're just gonna have to
do your job and protect me, aren't you?

18:15.296 --> 18:19.424
Never got a chance to tell you
how sorry I was about your daddy.

18:21.761 --> 18:24.086
We may have had our
differences at the end,

18:24.222 --> 18:26.713
but we made a lot of money together
over the years,

18:26.849 --> 18:29.767
and he didn't deserve
to go out like that.

18:30.228 --> 18:33.264
Well, I appreciate that, sir.
I know he regarded you very highly.

18:33.397 --> 18:35.390
Listen to the two of you.

18:35.525 --> 18:39.143
I think I'm getting a cavity,
this is all so sweet.

18:39.278 --> 18:41.105
Is that what you came here
to talk about, Boyd?

18:41.239 --> 18:44.857
No, ma'am.
I'm not sure if you've heard,

18:44.992 --> 18:47.828
but I have recently been employed
by Black Pike.

18:48.496 --> 18:50.535
Heard the rumours, sure.

18:52.291 --> 18:55.328
I was wondering what angle
you might be playing there.

18:55.878 --> 18:57.622
No angle, sir.
I'm just trying to live it clean.

18:57.755 --> 19:00.922
As a gun thug for the mining company?

19:01.050 --> 19:03.126
You know what your daddy
would have to say about that?

19:06.556 --> 19:11.348
Black Pike needs your Indian Line property
to secure all the land around the mountain,

19:11.477 --> 19:13.885
and we are prepared
to offer you a lease...

19:14.021 --> 19:17.106
You can stop right there, son. We're
not signing that land over to anyone.

19:17.233 --> 19:20.068
Technically the property
is in Helen's name.

19:20.194 --> 19:24.322
You really come over here thinking we'd
sign that land over to a mining company?

19:24.866 --> 19:27.570
No, ma'am, but I get paid to ask.

19:29.162 --> 19:31.154
Want a snort of bourbon before you go?

19:31.289 --> 19:34.907
If I'm gonna deliver bad news, I best
do it without liquor on my breath.

19:35.042 --> 19:36.537
Am I gonna see you both
at the meeting tonight?

19:36.669 --> 19:40.998
I've heard it all before, and you
certainly won't be seeing this one.

19:44.343 --> 19:46.003
A gift from my boy.

19:46.137 --> 19:49.054
Well, it looks like
Raylan Givens was here.

19:49.515 --> 19:52.682
Speaking of which, have you seen him
since he's been in town?

19:52.810 --> 19:54.008
Didn't know he was.

19:54.145 --> 19:57.893
Although I did get the impression that
it wasn't gonna be for long.

19:58.024 --> 20:00.645
Has he said anything to you
about leaving Kentucky?

20:08.618 --> 20:10.943
You see any fast moves,
anybody reaches into a bag

20:11.078 --> 20:13.201
or anything, you let me know, all right?

20:19.795 --> 20:21.954
- Tom.
- What happened to you?

20:24.008 --> 20:25.206
How are we looking?

20:26.135 --> 20:28.294
We're looking good.
We got six men around the room,

20:28.429 --> 20:31.383
and we're checking for
firearms at the door,

20:31.515 --> 20:33.473
but since this is Harlan,
it's kind of an uphill battle.

20:33.601 --> 20:37.848
I know. And your boys,
they all got pictures of Kirby Jr.?

20:37.980 --> 20:40.352
Oh, yeah. If he shows up,
they'll spot him.

20:40.483 --> 20:41.728
Okay.

20:44.237 --> 20:46.644
Technically, the property
is in Helen's name,

20:46.781 --> 20:49.402
so you'd have to convince both her
and Raylan's old man.

20:49.533 --> 20:52.451
- Raylan's mother pass?
- A long time ago.

20:52.578 --> 20:54.072
What was a long time ago?

20:54.747 --> 20:56.870
I heard you had a bit of trouble
this afternoon,

20:56.999 --> 20:59.039
evident by all the bruises on your face.

20:59.502 --> 21:01.126
So, you can still see it?

21:04.382 --> 21:05.461
What's the plan?

21:05.591 --> 21:08.877
The plan is that if Miss Johnson sees
anything that spooks her,

21:09.011 --> 21:12.214
she gets down behind that podium fast
and she stays down.

21:12.348 --> 21:14.969
- What do you want me to do?
- You,

21:15.309 --> 21:19.389
if you see anyone pull a gun,
step in front of it.

21:21.691 --> 21:24.395
- Evening, everyone.
- Good evening.

21:28.864 --> 21:33.526
Ladies and gentlemen, we're here tonight
to talk about coal, and coal is dirty.

21:33.661 --> 21:36.069
Always has been, always will be.

21:36.747 --> 21:42.501
But it's still coal that provides more
than half the electricity used in the US,

21:43.421 --> 21:46.338
much of it coming from the heart
of your great state of Kentucky.

21:49.635 --> 21:53.715
A miner makes a good living at Black
Pike. Just ask Raylan Givens here.

21:54.640 --> 21:59.219
He used to be a miner.
Now he's a decorated US Marshal.

21:59.770 --> 22:03.471
He was assigned by a judge to watch
over me tonight, keep me safe.

22:04.066 --> 22:07.233
I asked, "Why do I need protection?
We're all friends here." Isn't that right?

22:08.738 --> 22:13.696
Marshal, if I may, now, your salary
as a law-enforcement officer

22:13.826 --> 22:17.160
is about $1,100 a week.
Isn't that right?

22:18.414 --> 22:19.789
Base pay, starting out, about that.

22:19.915 --> 22:22.204
Same thing as what a miner makes,
isn't that right?

22:22.335 --> 22:23.449
We get overtime.

22:26.005 --> 22:31.379
And marshals get paid 52 weeks
out of the year.

22:33.054 --> 22:39.341
I put in 15 years. That's what, around
800 weeks of pay without a miss.

22:40.061 --> 22:41.769
And if I have to take a day off,

22:42.063 --> 22:44.850
if, for example, I have
a ferocious hangover...

22:46.233 --> 22:48.191
Or got your ass whupped.

22:49.195 --> 22:50.440
Or that.

22:51.947 --> 22:55.696
If I take a sick day, I don't get fired.

22:56.994 --> 22:58.369
I get paid.

23:03.042 --> 23:05.034
Well, now, hold on a second!

23:05.169 --> 23:10.839
There's two sides, two sides to every
coin, so let's hear the other side.

23:10.966 --> 23:13.292
Now, I grew up in a mine,

23:13.427 --> 23:15.965
shoulder to shoulder with the marshal,
in fact, and you all know me.

23:16.472 --> 23:18.381
You know my background.
You know my history.

23:18.516 --> 23:21.433
It's not easy for a man like me
to come by honest work.

23:21.811 --> 23:26.686
But this woman,
Carol Johnson, and Black Pike,

23:27.316 --> 23:29.558
they gave me a second chance.

23:30.111 --> 23:33.480
Now, I believe they're here
to stimulate this economy,

23:33.614 --> 23:39.783
make it fertile in infertile times,
and what we need right now is jobs!

23:39.912 --> 23:42.699
- Yeah.
- I believe Black Pike is here to help,

23:42.832 --> 23:46.035
if we let them.
I believe they're here to help.

23:47.503 --> 23:52.081
Now, I come into this county and look
around, and I see empty businesses.

23:52.216 --> 23:55.881
I see houses in shambles. I see
families struggling to make ends meet.

23:56.804 --> 23:59.674
We can bring prosperity
back to this land.

24:00.307 --> 24:03.842
God put coal in these hills
for just that purpose.

24:03.978 --> 24:08.640
I believe that deep down in my heart,
and I think, I think you all do, too.

24:21.287 --> 24:28.203
Apparently, Black Pike is here
to help us realise God's great plan.

24:28.919 --> 24:33.712
And all they're asking us to let them do
is cut the top off our mountain.

24:35.551 --> 24:38.718
Well, my people pioneered this valley

24:38.846 --> 24:42.630
when George Washington
was president of the United States.

24:44.185 --> 24:48.182
And as long as we've been here,
the story's always been the same.

24:48.314 --> 24:53.652
The big-money men come in, take the timber
and the coal and the strength of our people.

24:53.778 --> 24:55.320
- That's right.
- That's absolutely right.

24:55.446 --> 24:57.984
And what do they leave behind?

24:58.115 --> 25:03.738
Poundments full of poison slurry
and valleys full of toxic trash!

25:04.038 --> 25:05.200
Yeah!

25:06.040 --> 25:10.452
You know what happens when 500
million gallons of slurry breaks loose?

25:13.005 --> 25:14.285
The gates of hell open.

25:14.423 --> 25:17.626
Those poundments are built strong
to keep the slurry back.

25:17.760 --> 25:21.758
The gates of hell open, and all that
waste rolls down through the hollers

25:22.598 --> 25:27.260
and poisons the water and the land
and everything it touches!

25:29.396 --> 25:33.975
Mining company has a...
Has a word for those leavings.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.648
Doesn't it?

25:38.864 --> 25:40.275
The spoil.

25:43.452 --> 25:44.911
The spoil!

25:46.372 --> 25:51.532
And that is what our lives will be if
Black Pike has their way with our mountain.

25:51.877 --> 25:56.669
With all due respect, Mrs. Bennett,
Black Pike will replace the mountaintops

25:56.799 --> 25:59.919
and leave money, a lot of money,

26:00.052 --> 26:03.172
in the pockets of the working people
of Bennett and Harlan counties.

26:03.722 --> 26:06.344
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, ma'am, that is a fact.

26:06.475 --> 26:09.013
Well, that's something to consider,

26:09.979 --> 26:11.852
'cause it ain't an easy life here.

26:12.898 --> 26:14.309
No, ma'am.

26:15.442 --> 26:17.102
To an outsider,
it's probably hard to understand

26:17.236 --> 26:21.364
why we're all not just lining up
and saying, "Where do we sign?"

26:23.409 --> 26:29.862
But we got our own kind of food,
our own music, our own liquor.

26:29.999 --> 26:31.707
Yeah!

26:31.834 --> 26:35.452
We got our own way of courting
and raising children

26:35.588 --> 26:37.212
and our own way of living and dying.

26:38.674 --> 26:40.417
And to protect all that,

26:40.551 --> 26:44.549
we have got to say, "No, thank you," to Miss
Carol Johnson here and Black Pike Mining.

26:45.931 --> 26:50.095
Hey! Hey! Hey! Which is why
I have put up my own money

26:50.227 --> 26:51.852
to stop the landowners

26:52.563 --> 26:56.014
from selling their rights away
to the mining company.

26:57.192 --> 27:00.478
Now, just yesterday, Reggie here...
Hello, Reggie.

27:01.071 --> 27:05.069
Reggie here turned me down.
Sold out to Black Pike instead.

27:06.744 --> 27:08.286
It's all right, Reggie.

27:08.787 --> 27:11.409
I understand what kind of pressure
you were under.

27:13.208 --> 27:17.538
But sometimes we need to stop and
remember just what it is we've got to lose.

27:19.882 --> 27:25.256
Which is why I'm inviting you all up our
way tomorrow for a big, ol' whoop-de-do!

27:25.387 --> 27:26.881
Whoop-de-do!

27:30.601 --> 27:32.309
Everybody, come.

27:33.937 --> 27:35.597
Even you, Reggie.

27:38.150 --> 27:39.692
And especially you, Miss Johnson.

27:42.529 --> 27:46.990
I want you all to see just what it is
we are fighting for down here.

28:07.221 --> 28:08.715
Give me that.

28:26.407 --> 28:27.865
What's that?

28:30.994 --> 28:32.026
A firecracker.

28:32.413 --> 28:33.907
A firecracker?

28:35.124 --> 28:36.369
That's our gunshot?

28:36.500 --> 28:37.994
It appears so.

28:43.757 --> 28:45.086
What are you doing?

28:45.217 --> 28:51.718
I was just thinking. It exploded
at a pretty ideal time for you.

28:52.558 --> 28:54.016
You think I had someone set that off?

28:54.143 --> 28:57.179
Before the meeting got too out of hand.

28:57.563 --> 29:01.181
Might have even gained
a little sympathy for your side.

29:01.442 --> 29:04.526
Any sympathy I had started to slip
away when you said your piece.

29:04.653 --> 29:08.069
My job is to protect you,
not your company's agenda.

29:08.657 --> 29:13.402
Well, I admit it was a well-timed prank,
but I didn't have anything to do with it.

29:13.537 --> 29:17.784
Hell, my heart's still pounding.
Want to feel?

29:18.709 --> 29:21.081
You've had enough fun for today.

29:32.806 --> 29:34.182
Ava, you here?

29:43.859 --> 29:45.234
Get him! Get him!

29:47.070 --> 29:49.028
Now, it's just business, Boyd.

29:50.407 --> 29:52.151
Got a little warning for you here.

29:52.284 --> 29:56.151
You got to go to another house, you got to
stand up in that meeting! You're stupid!

29:59.750 --> 30:01.030
Back off!

30:03.253 --> 30:05.163
Girl, you ain't shooting nobody!

30:05.297 --> 30:07.254
What the... What the hell?

30:07.925 --> 30:09.882
No! No!

30:11.386 --> 30:14.222
- You killed Charlie!
- Get out of my house!

30:15.557 --> 30:17.135
Make me ask again!

30:18.310 --> 30:19.508
Out!

30:20.771 --> 30:22.977
- Go on!
- You should have killed me, girl.

30:23.106 --> 30:25.598
Come on, Coov. Come on. It's okay.

30:28.946 --> 30:30.226
Charlie!

30:33.325 --> 30:35.033
- Dickie...
- Come on.

30:40.541 --> 30:41.951
Oh, my God.

30:43.001 --> 30:44.282
Jesus.

30:46.964 --> 30:49.122
- I'm divorced.
- You left her?

30:50.133 --> 30:52.803
- She left me.
- Why? You fool around?

30:52.928 --> 30:55.086
Not once in six years.

30:56.014 --> 30:58.932
I went to Miami.
She left me for a realtor.

31:00.102 --> 31:01.845
That's a sad story.

31:03.105 --> 31:07.683
So, is the Marshals Service gonna reimburse
me for the decimation of my minibar?

31:07.818 --> 31:09.609
It's the least Black Pike can do,

31:10.153 --> 31:11.945
after I saved you from that firecracker.

31:15.325 --> 31:17.733
Are you gonna sleep
in that chair tonight?

31:17.870 --> 31:20.491
I figure if I drink enough,
I can sleep just about anywhere.

31:20.831 --> 31:22.823
I have a big bed. I'm happy to share it.

31:23.750 --> 31:24.948
Yes.

31:26.378 --> 31:29.083
I appreciate the offer, but...

31:29.840 --> 31:32.461
But you might get in trouble
with the Marshals Service.

31:33.260 --> 31:36.510
I believe I'm already in trouble
with the Marshals Service.

31:37.014 --> 31:39.884
I have never been married.
I probably never will.

31:40.017 --> 31:41.475
And your dad was a miner,

31:41.602 --> 31:43.760
and now you work for
the coal company.

31:44.062 --> 31:47.431
My daddy died. I was at Columbia.

31:47.566 --> 31:52.987
I switched my major from English literature
to mineral and mining engineering,

31:53.155 --> 31:55.194
and then I went on to
work for the company.

31:55.532 --> 31:57.441
And you saved your love for your dog.

31:58.160 --> 32:03.285
I have a cat.
That's what I call him, "Cat."

32:05.083 --> 32:06.910
I say, "Come here, Cat."

32:08.587 --> 32:10.829
I pet him, but he never purrs.

32:11.548 --> 32:12.829
Yeah, well...

32:15.427 --> 32:18.677
All right, well,
you better get some sleep.

32:18.805 --> 32:21.475
- We have an early morning.
- Okay.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.806
We got to make one more stop
on our way to Mags'.

32:23.936 --> 32:26.012
Yeah? Where would that be?

32:29.107 --> 32:30.815
Your Aunt Helen's.

32:32.194 --> 32:35.230
- Just hold still.
- I'm awful sorry, Ava.

32:37.032 --> 32:38.859
You want to tell me
what's going on, Boyd?

32:38.992 --> 32:43.156
It's pretty obvious. The Bennetts
are trying to secure those properties,

32:43.288 --> 32:46.325
same as Black Pike. But Black Pike
owns the entire mountaintop.

32:46.458 --> 32:49.661
The only reason we're chasing those
properties is 'cause the Bennetts are, too.

32:49.795 --> 32:51.834
You can't keep doing
what you're doing, Boyd.

32:51.964 --> 32:55.048
No. But if I can figure out

32:56.259 --> 32:59.878
what the Bennetts are up to, there might be
a way out of this thing that works for us.

33:00.639 --> 33:01.837
For us?

33:05.394 --> 33:08.810
Well, I don't know much, but it seems to me
it always comes down to one thing.

33:09.231 --> 33:10.974
- What's that?
- Money.

33:12.609 --> 33:16.227
The birthplace of the great
Raylan Givens. This is so exciting.

33:16.613 --> 33:18.570
Try to contain yourself.

33:19.825 --> 33:22.826
Helen, Arlo, this is Carol Johnson
of Black Pike Mining.

33:23.245 --> 33:25.284
First Boyd, and now you.

33:26.164 --> 33:28.204
The entire world gone upside down?

33:28.333 --> 33:32.497
That's it, preach ethics while shackled
to a government-issued ankle tether.

33:32.921 --> 33:36.290
We already told your lackey Boyd
that we ain't selling that land.

33:36.425 --> 33:40.469
Now, you two, hush. We have a guest,
and we will act accordingly.

33:40.595 --> 33:42.553
It's all right, Mrs. Givens.
I understand the reaction.

33:42.931 --> 33:45.220
Hope you didn't do
that to my boy's face.

33:45.642 --> 33:47.017
Try to act right, Arlo.

33:47.352 --> 33:50.804
My apologies, Carol.
Arlo will hear out your offer.

33:52.816 --> 33:55.437
You come into town,
you don't see your Aunt Helen?

33:55.569 --> 33:57.360
Well, I'm seeing you now, ain't I?

33:57.487 --> 33:58.650
Only 'cause of Black Pike.

33:59.197 --> 34:00.692
Well, yeah.

34:01.491 --> 34:04.196
And what's this I hear about
you may be leaving?

34:04.328 --> 34:05.703
What are you talking?
Where'd you hear that?

34:05.829 --> 34:06.860
Boyd mentioned it.

34:06.997 --> 34:08.824
Well, if Boyd said it,
then it must be true.

34:08.956 --> 34:10.996
Well, you ain't denied it yet.

34:11.126 --> 34:12.454
That's true, too.

34:12.585 --> 34:14.458
Are you trying to say
you're not thinking about it?

34:14.588 --> 34:15.963
I think about a lot of things, Helen.

34:16.297 --> 34:19.132
I never expected you to stay
in Kentucky, Raylan.

34:19.259 --> 34:21.750
- I was surprised you ever came back.
- Me, too.

34:21.887 --> 34:24.175
And to tell you the honest truth,
I wish you hadn't.

34:26.391 --> 34:28.929
I loved you like you were my own,
ever since you were little.

34:29.770 --> 34:33.020
You were the reason I spent
as much time as I did in this house.

34:34.983 --> 34:37.818
You want the rest of that money
before you go,

34:37.944 --> 34:40.317
the $20,000 Arlo and I took
from the Marshals?

34:40.447 --> 34:43.447
All these times I've been asking him for
it, now you're just gonna give it to me?

34:44.159 --> 34:48.025
On the condition this cuts all ties
between you and Harlan County,

34:48.663 --> 34:51.119
and I mean you leave all of it,
including the Bennetts.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.908
Why are you so concerned
about the Bennetts?

34:54.293 --> 34:57.295
You want the money, you
leave it all behind.

34:57.756 --> 35:01.255
So I leave Harlan,
you give me a bagful of money?

35:02.594 --> 35:04.421
Actually, I kind of like that deal.

35:07.182 --> 35:08.557
Get down!

35:12.771 --> 35:14.182
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

35:14.523 --> 35:17.014
All right.
Everybody in the house, right now!

35:19.069 --> 35:20.100
Go.

35:34.418 --> 35:37.584
- Who's shooting at us?
- I don't know! You goddamn...

35:41.341 --> 35:43.879
That son of a... That...

35:52.519 --> 35:54.595
- Call 911.
- That phone hasn't worked for months.

35:55.313 --> 35:57.851
You'd know that if you ever called.

36:03.572 --> 36:06.027
- I have no service.
- Yeah, I know.

36:06.158 --> 36:08.649
- Hold still, huh?
- Get away from me with that knife!

36:10.328 --> 36:11.704
How long does it usually take them
to get here?

36:11.830 --> 36:14.119
Five, 10 minutes, at least...
I don't know how long!

36:14.249 --> 36:16.574
All right. Everybody just keep
their heads down.

36:16.710 --> 36:18.749
Stay away from any doors and windows.

36:18.879 --> 36:21.666
And if anyone comes through that door,
you shoot them.

36:23.800 --> 36:24.879
Unless it's me.

37:35.288 --> 37:36.948
Oh, my God!

37:37.082 --> 37:38.457
Hey! Hey! Who's with you?

37:38.583 --> 37:39.614
I'm alone!

37:40.335 --> 37:44.463
Look at me. Where is your brother?
Kirby Jr. Where is he?

37:44.589 --> 37:47.127
Those bastards! They killed my father!

37:47.259 --> 37:49.251
Look at me. Where's your brother?

37:49.386 --> 37:51.177
Right now, you tell me
where your brother is, huh?

37:51.304 --> 37:53.297
I think you broke my arm!

37:54.224 --> 37:56.347
Hey. Hey! Officer!

37:56.476 --> 37:59.394
US Marshal.
I got our shooter in custody.

38:00.563 --> 38:02.390
- Your radio get outside this holler?
- Yes, sir.

38:02.524 --> 38:05.525
All right. I need you to get a hold
of the marshals in Lexington.

38:05.652 --> 38:07.941
Tell them Judge Reardon
is not to leave his home.

38:08.071 --> 38:10.277
- A shooter outside waiting for him.
- Judge Reardon, got it.

38:11.700 --> 38:14.950
Hey, you get me some
paramedics, huh?

38:17.706 --> 38:18.951
Boyd.

38:20.417 --> 38:22.125
What are you doing?

38:24.254 --> 38:25.997
I figured it out.

38:27.507 --> 38:29.665
I know what Mags is up to.

38:30.760 --> 38:33.086
And what would that be, exactly?

38:34.222 --> 38:36.678
I'm gonna need you to put on a dress.

38:36.808 --> 38:38.136
What? Why?

38:38.893 --> 38:41.349
'Cause we're going to
the Bennetts' party.

38:45.066 --> 38:46.774
Something pretty.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.452
Well, they got Kirby Jr.

39:02.584 --> 39:03.864
He was outside the judge's residence.

39:04.169 --> 39:05.248
So, it's over?

39:05.378 --> 39:08.415
Not till I get you out
of coal country alive.

39:08.548 --> 39:11.466
You think the Peener clan's the only
ones wishing you harm down here?

39:11.593 --> 39:13.467
- No, I suppose not.
- No.

39:14.679 --> 39:17.716
I don't suppose you still intend
on going to Mags' party,

39:17.849 --> 39:19.094
- do you?
- Yeah.

39:19.309 --> 39:21.183
Why we got to walk
into that lion's den?

39:21.519 --> 39:22.599
I got a job to do,

39:23.188 --> 39:25.560
- and so do you.
- Give me a minute.

39:28.943 --> 39:30.224
How we doing in here?

39:30.362 --> 39:31.607
I got a hole in my leg!

39:31.738 --> 39:33.398
How the hell do you think I'm doing?

39:33.531 --> 39:34.694
He's gonna be fine.

39:34.824 --> 39:37.611
We just need to take him in and make
sure we haven't missed anything.

39:37.744 --> 39:40.496
You ought to run back
to your Marshals Service buddies,

39:40.622 --> 39:42.947
have them bring me out a new tether!

39:47.921 --> 39:49.498
Just like that, huh?

39:49.631 --> 39:51.125
Just like that.

39:54.052 --> 39:57.302
So, what now?
You head back up to Lexington?

39:57.430 --> 40:01.048
- Soon. There's something I got to do first.
- What's that?

40:02.936 --> 40:04.727
Going to Mags' party.

40:06.856 --> 40:09.893
Raylan! The whole reason
I gave you that money is you agreed

40:10.026 --> 40:11.057
to stay away from the Bennetts!

40:11.611 --> 40:12.809
I lied.
