03:09.657 --> 03:13.527
<i>This was the summer
before it all went wrong.</i>

03:13.560 --> 03:15.062
British!

03:15.096 --> 03:18.099
<i>That's me, Dale,
Boys' Camp section head.</i>

03:18.132 --> 03:19.834
Bulldog!

03:19.867 --> 03:22.435
<i>And that's my best friend, Ben,
in his element.</i>

03:22.469 --> 03:26.974
<i>Boys' camp, for the entire month,
every summer. Here, he was a king.</i>

03:29.409 --> 03:35.448
<i>But during the rest of the year...
a different story.</i>

03:37.018 --> 03:39.020
<i>The game was British Bulldog.</i>

03:39.053 --> 03:41.856
<i>One guy starts in the middle,
everyone else to one side,</i>

03:41.889 --> 03:44.558
<i>the goal being to cross to the
other side without being touched.</i>

03:49.429 --> 03:51.632
<i>I say touched, 'cause that's
what's in the brochure.</i>

03:51.666 --> 03:55.770
<i>And that's the display we put on
for the parents on visitor's day.</i>

03:55.803 --> 04:00.808
<i>But in reality... chaos.</i>

04:04.145 --> 04:09.583
<i>But no matter what drama occurred, all
was forgiven and forgotten minutes later.</i>

04:10.685 --> 04:16.456
<i>Often the magical juices of the freezie would
enable any residual grudge to melt away.</i>

04:17.524 --> 04:20.027
Come on, top bunks!
Two more outs and we got this!

04:20.061 --> 04:23.030
- I call grape!
- Me too! Grape!

04:23.064 --> 04:26.566
- If there's only one grape, I get it.
- Oh, fuck that!

04:26.601 --> 04:28.435
Fuck that? Man, fuck you!

04:28.468 --> 04:30.972
Hey! Language!

04:31.005 --> 04:34.976
<i>A ninth inning could take forever sometimes,
kids jockeying for freezie flavors.</i>

04:35.009 --> 04:37.577
<i>But that's the difference
between boys and girls.</i>

04:37.612 --> 04:40.681
<i>Guys can beat the shit out of each
other and moments later, best friends.</i>

04:40.715 --> 04:44.685
<i>Girls? Well, if you don't like
their new jeans and it's...</i>

04:44.719 --> 04:45.686
Bitch!

04:47.088 --> 04:48.623
Hose-bag!

04:49.790 --> 04:51.458
<i>That's me, Amber.</i>

04:51.491 --> 04:53.761
Calm down, ladies!
What the hell is going on here?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.762
- Those jeans make her look fat!
- Carla said that these jeans make me look fat!

04:54.795 --> 04:56.764
<i>Glorified baby-sitter.</i>

04:56.797 --> 04:58.666
- They don't make you look that fat.
- They don't.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.801
- You look perfect, Stacey.
- I love you.

05:00.835 --> 05:02.970
I love you.

05:03.004 --> 05:04.772
I can't tell the difference between
your bum, and your front bum.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.074
It's like two bums.

05:07.108 --> 05:09.877
Come on girls, remember,
if you can't say anything nice,

05:09.911 --> 05:12.079
- don't say any...
- Fuck off!

05:12.113 --> 05:15.448
Language! Jesus fuck.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.185
- Fuck you, virgin!
- I'm not a virgin!

05:18.219 --> 05:20.587
- Get off me.
- Stacey, get off me bitch.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.455
- Kick her ass.
- <i>This would go on for hours,</i>

05:22.489 --> 05:25.458
<i>and it would end in tears
and candles.</i>

05:25.492 --> 05:30.597
I just want to say that
I truly love all of you.

05:30.631 --> 05:35.736
I just wanted to say that I truly
do feel like you're all my sisters,

05:35.770 --> 05:38.172
and I respect that bond.

05:38.205 --> 05:43.044
I just wanted to say
that I love all of you guys

05:43.077 --> 05:48.249
and that I don't think you should ever
change and that you should respect yourself,

05:48.282 --> 05:51.652
because they can't
ever take that away from you.

05:51.686 --> 05:54.055
I just want to add in, if I can.

05:54.088 --> 05:56.757
I feel like
you are all my sisters,

05:56.791 --> 05:59.927
and that at the end of the day,
we have each other,

05:59.961 --> 06:01.494
and that's truly what love is.

06:04.632 --> 06:11.571
I just wanted to add to that that I truly
do respect everything you're saying,

06:11.605 --> 06:18.179
and that this just goes to show
how our bond is truly everlasting,

06:18.212 --> 06:20.513
and that's forever, guys.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.724
Thanks, Dany.

06:30.992 --> 06:36.897
<i>But it was great, all of August, we got to
be our true selves, just girls, no boys.</i>

06:36.931 --> 06:38.833
<i>And that's just the way
we liked it,</i>

06:38.866 --> 06:41.936
<i>the whole month of July,
just testosterone, no girls.</i>

06:46.674 --> 06:48.776
- Roger.
- Sit the fuck down.

06:55.349 --> 06:58.919
Listen, Dale,
starting next summer,

06:58.953 --> 07:02.890
Camp Kindlewood,
is going to be co-ed.

07:02.923 --> 07:07.094
Wait, is that when we can
earn school credit?

07:08.262 --> 07:09.230
No.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.101
- That's when two girls kiss each other, isn't it?
- No, it isn't.

07:14.135 --> 07:16.003
Yes, I'm pretty sure it is.

07:16.037 --> 07:19.340
- I got this VHS tape at home...
- No, Dale.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.742
The camp will be co-ed.

07:21.776 --> 07:25.079
There will be boys and girls, the
same site, for the entirety of summer.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.214
Huh.

07:27.248 --> 07:29.984
And that means there will probably
have to be some changes made.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.685
Yeah, changes, like what?

07:31.719 --> 07:33.254
No more naked morning dips.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.293
What... that's how we wake up
in the morning!

07:39.326 --> 07:41.362
And clean the cracks!

07:41.395 --> 07:47.034
Yeah, well... and also,
no more peeing wherever you happen to be.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.276
- You mean we gotta walk to the washrooms?
- Yes.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.279
- Even for number one?
- Specifically, number one!

07:58.312 --> 08:00.781
- So, number two we can just...
- No!

08:00.815 --> 08:04.785
Both numbers, all numbers, one, two,
forty-three, all go into the washroom!

08:04.819 --> 08:07.188
Well, Roger, that's going to
cut into our daily schedule.

08:07.221 --> 08:11.225
Well, add this to your schedule.
No more firekeepers.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.860
What?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.361
<i>This was the tipping point.</i>

08:14.395 --> 08:15.863
<i>Firekeepers was our
rite of passage.</i>

08:15.896 --> 08:20.734
<i>Our mildly homoerotic
end-of-summer manhood ceremony.</i>

08:20.768 --> 08:22.703
So, basically, what you're
saying right now is that

08:22.736 --> 08:26.073
anything involving our
penises... penii... dicks,

08:26.107 --> 08:28.042
whatever, is just off the table.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.811
- Well, your dicks were never on the table.
- Metaphorically.

08:30.845 --> 08:33.681
Then metaphorically, yes.
Your dicks are now off the table.

08:33.714 --> 08:38.185
Okay, if that's a metaphor, then in
reality we can put our dicks on the table?

08:38.219 --> 08:40.020
You are such an ass-wipe!

08:40.054 --> 08:41.155
You know what I mean.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.224
No, I don't know what you mean.

08:43.257 --> 08:46.794
The camp is going to be co-ed
next summer.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.129
Do you want me to
kiss another girl?

08:48.162 --> 08:49.363
No!

08:51.799 --> 08:58.339
No, no, no, no. What it means
is, instead of just boys in July,

08:58.372 --> 09:01.876
and just girls in August,

09:01.909 --> 09:06.947
there will be both
boys and girls in the camp,

09:06.981 --> 09:09.116
this camp, all together.

09:09.150 --> 09:11.752
Why are you emphasizing
every other word like that?

09:11.785 --> 09:14.989
I'm just trying to set this up,
so it's clear.

09:16.257 --> 09:18.692
So, why are you telling me?

09:18.726 --> 09:22.463
I need your help to get the necessary
buy-in from the other female staff,

09:22.496 --> 09:26.267
you know, for the inevitable
changes that are coming.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.002
Like what exactly?

09:28.035 --> 09:31.405
Well, no more
condom balloon fights.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.846
And definitely
no more tomacocking.

09:41.215 --> 09:43.484
Great. So anything emasculating.

09:43.517 --> 09:46.020
Yes, basically.

09:46.053 --> 09:49.990
That reminds me.
No more full moon sacrifices.

09:51.158 --> 09:55.196
<i>That's Dany.
She has mad wicked skills.</i>

09:58.232 --> 10:00.334
So you knew about that?

10:00.367 --> 10:03.037
So it wasn't a dream! Ha!

10:05.806 --> 10:07.474
...which is what we
learned in the last chapter.

10:07.508 --> 10:09.910
<i>With boys in July
and girls in August,</i>

10:09.944 --> 10:11.912
<i>this was actually the first time
Dale and I met.</i>

10:11.946 --> 10:14.515
You're gonna end up with
one or two options...

10:14.548 --> 10:15.816
Shit.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.019
Hey.

10:20.321 --> 10:21.255
Thank you.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.892
What?

10:24.925 --> 10:28.395
I've got a 10-pack, so it's...

10:36.170 --> 10:37.972
Smooth move, Ex-Lax.

10:49.550 --> 10:50.818
Oh, God!

11:10.137 --> 11:13.507
Hey, nice Bela Lugosi.

11:13.540 --> 11:18.078
Yeah, well, the party store was
all out of Kiefer Sutherland, so.

11:20.447 --> 11:27.121
I see they were overstocked
on sexy nurse, sexy witch...

11:27.154 --> 11:28.956
I guess that, what is that?

11:28.989 --> 11:31.325
Sexy, neglectful zombie mother?

11:32.593 --> 11:34.828
I don't know how I feel
about that one.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.232
Well, come on. Let's go
have some fun. Let's go.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.534
- I don't know. I don't know. I mean...
- Come on.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.971
...look, you got all the moves, right?
I don't think I could keep up with that.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.507
Well, I can't keep them off
much longer.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.575
You gotta,
you gotta make your move.

11:48.610 --> 11:52.212
You know, I... I don't know.
I think a Slutty Kitten can do... sexy.

11:52.246 --> 11:56.083
Fuck, I meant to say sexy. You're not
a slut, obviously, you're not a slut.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.620
- Right?
- Wow.

11:58.653 --> 12:02.356
I meant... fuck!

12:05.225 --> 12:09.063
And that's... time.
Pencils down.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.565
<i>Truthfully, I hadn't
given Dale a second thought</i>

12:11.598 --> 12:13.934
<i>until he opened his big mouth
again.</i>

12:13.967 --> 12:16.170
There was no turning back
from this.

12:16.203 --> 12:19.907
- Hey! Amber! Um...
- What?

12:19.940 --> 12:23.177
- Sorry, it's... it is Amber?
- Yeah, I mean, obviously.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.079
I turned around
when you said Amber.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.514
Sorry. Okay, look.

12:27.548 --> 12:32.353
Um, I just think that it's fine for you to...
to ignore me all year and... and hate me,

12:32.386 --> 12:36.957
if I called you a slut. But, I didn't.
I... I just misspoke.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.959
Is this supposed to be
an apology?

12:38.992 --> 12:41.128
No. That's what I'm saying.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.897
You see, I've been punished with
silence and dirty looks all year.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.165
But I didn't even
do the crime, right?

12:45.199 --> 12:48.302
It was like a...
like a Freud-slip-thing.

12:48.335 --> 12:51.271
Right. Well, you can't just go around
calling girls slutty, and expect...

12:51.305 --> 12:54.908
I didn't, that's the thing,
right? I... I didn't.

12:54.942 --> 12:59.179
I'm serving the sentence right
now, but look, like...

12:59.213 --> 13:02.617
I should now, like retroactively get
to call you a slut at a future date,

13:02.650 --> 13:06.320
to justify the punishment that
you've given me in advance.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.288
Wow. Alright, well,
good luck with that,

13:08.322 --> 13:10.991
but I'm gonna go off to my camp
this summer,

13:11.024 --> 13:13.628
so this is gonna have to wait
until the fall term.

13:14.729 --> 13:16.263
What camp do you go to?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.385
<i>That's Tiffany.</i>

13:38.419 --> 13:40.554
<i>She thought penicillin was
a fashion statement.</i>

13:40.587 --> 13:44.224
Love you more.
Okay, love you, Daddy. Bye.

13:47.729 --> 13:49.631
I think I need to
go to the clinic.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.338
<i>That's Donna.</i>

13:58.372 --> 14:00.407
<i>She read in a magazine once that there's
all these ratios in the human face</i>

14:00.441 --> 14:02.109
<i>that determine
if we're attractive or not,</i>

14:02.142 --> 14:05.546
<i>and that's why models are always
tilting their head to the side,</i>

14:05.579 --> 14:08.315
<i>so the brain can't pick up
on the ratios as much.</i>

14:18.693 --> 14:22.996
Thanks, Mr. Coffee.
Alright, ladies, let's go meet the boys.

14:35.777 --> 14:38.045
<i>We were ready to stake
our claim to the camp.</i>

14:38.078 --> 14:42.316
<i>But we planted our flag first,
"Say Anything" style.</i>

14:42.349 --> 14:45.720
Remember what we discussed.
Girls rule, boys drool.

14:48.756 --> 14:52.192
Okay. Don't forget.
Bros before hoes.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.495
Sistas before mistas.

14:54.528 --> 14:56.230
Dicks before chicks.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.801
Snitches get stitches.

14:59.834 --> 15:04.639
Gas, grass or ass.
Nobody rides for free. Let's go!

15:15.148 --> 15:17.351
Hello, counselors.

15:17.384 --> 15:20.387
Well, we are in for
an exciting summer.

15:20.420 --> 15:27.094
As you well know, and can plainly
see, and smell, we have gone co-ed.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.164
Now I myself am very excited
over this change,

15:31.198 --> 15:36.303
and the future prosperity it can
and will bring to this camp.

15:36.336 --> 15:42.109
Of course, I am anticipating that
not everything will go smooth-ly,

15:42.142 --> 15:47.180
so we've added some modules
to the usual training week.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.551
Oh, we have Gary here
from corporate,

15:50.584 --> 15:54.622
and he is going to lead us
through some sensitivity training.

15:55.857 --> 15:57.224
Gary!

16:04.598 --> 16:06.701
Okay... it's too loud.

16:08.636 --> 16:11.438
That's so loud, that hurts.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.507
I can't hear you,
the music's too loud!

16:13.540 --> 16:17.377
That's right, it, it's too loud.

16:18.312 --> 16:19.814
You're hurting the children.

16:22.717 --> 16:28.221
No, not up! Down! It's too loud!

16:28.255 --> 16:29.757
It's too...

16:32.827 --> 16:33.861
Okay.

16:39.533 --> 16:42.235
It's too quiet now,
it doesn't work.

16:42.269 --> 16:46.573
There's no, there's no beat, it doesn't...
there's nothing to this anymore.

16:47.942 --> 16:52.346
Hi, team. I'm Gary, with a Y.
You can call me Gar.

16:52.379 --> 16:57.517
So, what I'm gonna do for the next
few hours is guide you on a journey

16:57.551 --> 17:03.758
through tolerance and awareness so that you
have a better understanding of other sex.

17:05.793 --> 17:11.231
Sexes. So you have an understanding
of other, um, genders.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.267
Okay, so little ice breaker
first.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.470
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna divide into two groups.

17:16.503 --> 17:20.474
We're gonna have boys and then,
drumroll please, what's next, girls.

17:22.677 --> 17:24.846
Good. Well, that's a good start.

17:24.879 --> 17:27.547
Okay, so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna do some skits.

17:27.581 --> 17:32.787
These skits are a way to promote a healthy
lifestyle to someone from the opposite gender.

17:32.820 --> 17:35.288
So, here's how we're gonna
break this down:

17:35.322 --> 17:41.595
Boys, you're gonna help the ladies
understand better sun safety.

17:41.629 --> 17:44.297
Ladies, the boys,
so I've been told,

17:44.331 --> 17:48.535
they're having trouble figuring out
appropriate footwear to wear on a hike.

17:48.568 --> 17:52.539
Okay, you have thirty minutes,
help each other out. Go!

17:58.412 --> 18:04.819
- Hey, I see you!
- Shit. Yo, just play it cool. Play it cool.

18:04.852 --> 18:06.654
I still see you!

18:08.956 --> 18:10.390
Donna, right?

18:11.491 --> 18:15.429
Yeah, my, my name is Donna.
I... I am Donna.

18:15.462 --> 18:18.733
Look, we've got something fun planned, so... so
we just want to borrow some of your clothes.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.602
We'll bring them right back
after the skit.

18:22.637 --> 18:25.640
Is that okay, Don-don?

18:29.476 --> 18:33.313
- Yeah, it's like, totally okay.
- Cool.

18:33.346 --> 18:36.583
- Okay, yeah.
- See you soon.

18:38.019 --> 18:39.419
Okay, bye!

18:43.024 --> 18:45.693
Girls, listen up.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

18:45.727 --> 18:49.396
Just breathe, slow down, it's okay.

18:49.429 --> 18:53.333
- What's going on?
- The boys, they took our clothes, our personal clothes.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.036
They said they're gonna use them
for the skit!

18:55.069 --> 18:58.538
- I'm gonna chew their dicks off.
- No, they might like that.

18:58.572 --> 19:01.508
No, you know what? It's okay.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.045
The boys are planning on
getting us with this skit?

19:04.078 --> 19:05.412
We'll just have to
hit them first.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.583
Okay, I am really excited
to see these!

19:09.617 --> 19:12.285
So, who's up first,
boys or girls?

19:13.386 --> 19:15.589
Okay, ladies, you're up.

19:19.627 --> 19:23.064
So, Ben, how was your winter?

19:23.097 --> 19:25.532
- Good, yeah, yeah, pretty good.
- Good, good.

19:25.565 --> 19:29.536
- You know, actually, I had a real scare this morning.
- Oh?

19:29.569 --> 19:34.075
So, I... I wake up and I just...
I feel this, this hard lump.

19:34.108 --> 19:36.644
Immediately, I start...
I start freaking out.

19:36.677 --> 19:38.913
I mean, it's cancer, it's gotta be cancer,
I mean, what else can it be, right?

19:38.946 --> 19:41.348
There goes my summer, there goes my
hair, you know, so on and so forth.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.316
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, exactly.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.819
What happened?

19:44.852 --> 19:48.321
Oh, no, no, no, it was just,
uh, I had a boner.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.858
You know, like... like... like morning wood,
so I was just like "Whoa, what's that?"

19:50.892 --> 19:53.995
So, you know, I quickly finished and I rubbed
it on Hip-Hop's pillow before he could get up

19:54.028 --> 19:56.097
and called it a day, you know.

19:56.130 --> 19:58.065
Scary, scary in the moment,
though.

20:03.971 --> 20:06.439
Oh, yeah.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.542
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

20:08.575 --> 20:12.412
Hey, guys, don't we have that,
uh, hike to the lighthouse today?

20:12.445 --> 20:14.414
Yeah, yeah,
you're right.

20:14.447 --> 20:17.952
Uh, what should we wear on our feet?
You know, for the hike?

20:18.853 --> 20:23.891
Maybe we should wear some sandals,
I mean, that seems appropriate.

20:24.892 --> 20:29.429
But you know, why wear sandals,
when you can just go barefoot?

20:36.570 --> 20:41.909
Dany! I said barefoot,
not Bigfoot!

20:45.445 --> 20:47.014
- We got you.
- Burn.

20:47.048 --> 20:49.382
Yeah, burn.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.619
Bravo, excellent.

20:51.652 --> 20:55.522
See, the ladies used sarcasm as a way
to get their footwear message across

20:55.555 --> 20:59.093
while playfully poking fun at the boys.
Great job, ladies.

20:59.126 --> 21:02.395
Boys, can you beat that?

21:02.429 --> 21:05.032
- Do you think they're pissed?
- I'm sure they can take a joke.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.011
- Hey, Dany, how was your winter?
- Sucked.

21:17.044 --> 21:20.480
My mom is back with Barry, and he's a
fuckin' asshole and treats her like shit

21:20.513 --> 21:21.949
but she deserves it.

21:21.983 --> 21:23.851
She made me clean my room
the other day,

21:23.885 --> 21:25.753
and now I can't find any of
my knives except for this one.

21:26.654 --> 21:28.723
And I know Barry
sold them.

21:28.756 --> 21:31.424
Next day he's buying super big
gulps instead of regular big gulps.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.095
That assturd better
watch his six.

21:34.128 --> 21:37.965
Yeah, you ever tried pastels?

21:45.940 --> 21:49.810
Everybody have their sunscreen on?
'Cause it's time for the pool.

21:49.844 --> 21:52.613
SPF30 or higher I hope?

21:52.647 --> 21:53.848
Alright, let's get wet.

22:00.821 --> 22:04.859
- Priscilla, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

22:07.194 --> 22:09.596
Nothing?

22:09.630 --> 22:10.965
What do you mean nothing?

22:10.998 --> 22:13.000
Why can't you come
to the pool with us?

22:13.034 --> 22:16.637
- I can't.
- What do you mean, why not?

22:17.872 --> 22:20.675
It's my crotch.

22:20.708 --> 22:23.744
Your crotch?
What's wrong with it?

22:23.778 --> 22:26.113
It's bleeding.

22:26.147 --> 22:33.553
You see, when a girl reaches a certain age,
they get a special visitor every month.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.790
Why does this have to
happen to me?

22:35.823 --> 22:40.728
Well, you know at Halloween when you
dress up like a cat or a princess?

22:40.761 --> 22:43.197
Yeah.

22:43.230 --> 22:48.869
Well, your period means that you get to dress
up like a slutty cat, or a slutty princess.

22:48.903 --> 22:54.175
And this attracts the attention of boys,
and makes you feel better about yourself.

22:54.208 --> 22:58.112
Wow. I already feel better
about myself.

22:58.145 --> 23:00.748
And you know
who'll definitely understand?

23:00.781 --> 23:02.883
My boyfriend Ben.

23:02.917 --> 23:06.187
He's so handsome
and funny and smart.

23:06.220 --> 23:08.155
He won't care that
I'm on my period.

23:08.189 --> 23:12.193
In fact, I call his penis Moses
'cause it can part the Red Sea.

23:14.061 --> 23:15.663
Enough!

23:15.696 --> 23:18.531
You, you, you, you,
to my office right now!

23:19.333 --> 23:21.969
Good luck this summer.
You're gonna need it.

23:22.003 --> 23:26.607
- But, the rest of the training?
- What's the point? I tried.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.043
I danced for you.

23:29.076 --> 23:31.779
But this place is
on the scrap-heap.

23:31.812 --> 23:33.848
You just made my job
a whole lot easier.

23:35.683 --> 23:37.251
What was that?

23:41.022 --> 23:42.990
So, what's up, you mad bro?

23:43.024 --> 23:48.195
No, I'm not mad, I'm pissed!

23:48.229 --> 23:50.765
This is awesome. You know,
it's like he's the chief of police,

23:50.798 --> 23:52.599
and we're like, you know,
the wild card cops that he's...

23:52.633 --> 23:54.902
- Shut it, Ben!
- Okay, that's good, go with that.

23:57.872 --> 24:01.709
Maybe it's all my fault, maybe I
let you guys get away with too much,

24:01.742 --> 24:06.213
when this was just a boys' camp,
but things have got to change.

24:06.247 --> 24:12.620
I cannot stress how important it is for
this co-ed thing to work, you got it?

24:12.653 --> 24:14.955
Well, truthfully, no,
we don't got it.

24:14.989 --> 24:18.959
'Cause like, think about it,
if we did get it,

24:18.993 --> 24:23.864
then we probably wouldn't have done
that hateful sexist skit, right?

24:25.766 --> 24:30.671
<i>Okay, Bo is pretty dumb, but his
looks have helped him out a lot in life.</i>

24:36.377 --> 24:39.346
Seriously, we hate having
these chicks here, okay?

24:39.380 --> 24:42.683
We get our rocks off during the school
year but summer is for us to come up here,

24:42.716 --> 24:48.322
and... and... and like walk around
naked, listen to rap music.

24:49.690 --> 24:51.625
Word.

24:51.659 --> 24:54.195
<i>Hip-Hop was always talking about
an album he was producing,</i>

24:54.228 --> 24:57.898
<i>but the only thing he ever shared with
us were mixtapes with original cover art.</i>

24:57.932 --> 25:01.869
Look. I'll talk to the girls.

25:01.902 --> 25:04.271
I'll smooth things out
with them.

25:04.305 --> 25:07.007
But the campers are here
in a few days.

25:07.041 --> 25:10.377
We've gotta make this work,
right? Go team!

25:14.281 --> 25:16.884
Maybe we really should try
to make this work.

25:16.917 --> 25:18.652
Roger seems pretty desperate.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.224
Hey, I need you guys to take your
shit out of the laundry room.

25:23.257 --> 25:26.360
I found some more pee-pee sleeping
bags from last summer I gotta wash.

25:26.393 --> 25:29.296
Well, it ain't our shit,
Mr. Coffee, try the chicks.

25:29.330 --> 25:32.833
Trust me. It's yours.

25:41.375 --> 25:42.910
Goddamn it!

25:49.116 --> 25:52.419
Hey. I don't remember
doing this!

25:52.453 --> 25:54.021
This was my favorite
turtle neck.

25:59.493 --> 26:03.664
No fabric softener. Fuckers.

26:05.166 --> 26:09.470
Okay, so what, you think some... some...
some crotchless jeans are going to stop us?

26:09.503 --> 26:11.405
No, no, no, no, it's on!

26:12.406 --> 26:15.142
No, it was on when you decided
to do a skit about our periods

26:15.176 --> 26:17.244
and my Halloween costuming
choices.

26:17.278 --> 26:19.013
Well, actually,
if you were paying attention,

26:19.046 --> 26:21.348
it wasn't necessarily
your Halloween costuming,

26:21.382 --> 26:24.785
it was an imagined scenario,
it was presented to Priscilla.

26:24.818 --> 26:27.421
Technically, we may have started
it, I mean, our skit was first.

26:27.454 --> 26:30.824
Oh! No, no, no, no, no,
sweetheart, we started it.

26:30.858 --> 26:33.794
Your skit was so lame and stupid
it didn't offend,

26:33.827 --> 26:35.796
so it doesn't even count
as starting it.

26:35.829 --> 26:38.465
Well, you may have started it,
but we're going to finish this.

26:38.499 --> 26:42.403
How, by cutting more material
away from our jeans?

26:42.436 --> 26:45.206
If you cut away any more,
they become jean shorts,

26:45.239 --> 26:47.408
and then they become
useful again.

26:49.076 --> 26:51.312
That is not
how we're gonna end it.

26:51.345 --> 26:54.048
We're gonna end it tonight. See you
guys have to fall asleep at some point,

26:54.081 --> 26:56.984
you guys can't stay up forever,
and when you guys do fall asleep,

26:57.017 --> 27:01.455
I'm going to come into your
cabin and bite your dicks off.

27:01.488 --> 27:04.525
I'm going to bite them off
so hard and so fast,

27:04.558 --> 27:07.995
there won't be a split second when you
guys feel some moist lips around your dick,

27:08.028 --> 27:09.897
and you think, "Hey,
I'm getting a dream blowie, sweet."

27:09.930 --> 27:12.466
I'm going to skip right
to the pain, right away.

27:12.499 --> 27:16.403
You guys will be dreaming, flying through
the air, or... or swimming, and then bam!

27:16.437 --> 27:20.307
Shark bites off your dick, or maybe
it's the flying one, and then bam!

27:20.341 --> 27:24.845
Helicopter blades, maybe you guys get
too close and bam, chops off your dick.

27:24.878 --> 27:27.548
And you're gonna wake up,
screaming in pain,

27:27.581 --> 27:30.384
and all you guys are gonna see
in the glimmering moonlight

27:30.417 --> 27:36.123
is the ruby red glow of your dick juices
coming out of the corners of my mouth!

27:42.463 --> 27:47.167
<i>When the campers arrived, there was an
understood truce, but it wouldn't last long.</i>

28:04.518 --> 28:06.854
Hey, Zack,
where's your bag, little dude?

28:07.554 --> 28:09.823
Bareback, I like it, brother.

28:13.294 --> 28:17.197
Hey, Zack, hope your redneck parents sent
you up with enough tuck money this year.

28:20.034 --> 28:23.605
Hey, Zack, were Jason and Karl
about to kiss? Yeah, I think that.

28:23.638 --> 28:26.373
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
they were about to kiss!

28:26.407 --> 28:29.843
- Let me go, Ben!
- Or what, what? You're, you're gonna kiss Karl about it?

28:29.877 --> 28:32.579
No, I'll titty twist
your ass off!

28:32.614 --> 28:37.518
Whoa, hold up.
You'll titty twist my ass off?

28:37.551 --> 28:39.420
Shut up, you know what I meant.

28:39.453 --> 28:41.388
No, no, no, I'm gonna stand here
and let you explain it to me.

28:41.422 --> 28:45.159
You're gonna "titty twist
my ass off." Get outta here.

28:48.028 --> 28:50.931
Zack, you okay, buddy?
Where's your bag, man?

28:56.236 --> 28:59.440
- Stacey, how was your winter?
- It was really good.

28:59.473 --> 29:02.376
So I met this one guy
at school, he's like superhot.

29:02.409 --> 29:05.579
- Oh, my God! Did you make out?
- Kind of, but yeah.

29:05.613 --> 29:08.616
That's a sack, there's a sack,
that's a sack, here's a sack.

29:19.526 --> 29:22.129
Hey, you need a hand with that?

29:22.162 --> 29:24.031
No thanks, I got it.

29:24.064 --> 29:25.499
It's no trouble, I can...

29:25.532 --> 29:28.001
Excuse me, mista,
I want to do it on my own.

29:28.035 --> 29:29.503
I'm still growin', ya know.

29:32.172 --> 29:33.907
Wow, real mature, Dale.

29:33.941 --> 29:36.210
I... she wants to take it
on her own.

29:36.243 --> 29:40.047
- Thanks, Amber, my back was getting sore.
- I believe it.

29:52.694 --> 29:55.496
Alright, guys, hey, hey,
listen up, hey!

29:55.529 --> 29:57.364
Follow us, okay?

29:57.398 --> 30:00.601
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I hate that the girls are here,

30:00.635 --> 30:03.103
and we're going to destroy them
this summer.

30:05.038 --> 30:06.540
Agreed.

30:06.573 --> 30:08.942
<i>♪ Umagada umagada
choo choo choo! ♪</i>

30:08.976 --> 30:10.544
- But the scenery is nice, you know?
- <i>♪ Umagada umagada ♪</i>

30:10.577 --> 30:12.279
<i>♪ Choo choo choo! ♪</i>

30:13.715 --> 30:15.282
Agreed, yeah.

30:39.239 --> 30:44.679
<i>♪ Give me a home
Where the buffalo roam ♪</i>

30:44.712 --> 30:49.316
- Would you do him?
- Tiffany! Would I do him?

30:49.349 --> 30:52.386
Okay, fine, would you
third-base him?

30:52.419 --> 30:54.188
- Yes.
- Me too.

30:54.221 --> 30:59.761

30:59.794 --> 31:04.465

31:08.101 --> 31:13.775
Welcome campers to the opening campfire
of 1990 here at Camp Kindlewood!

31:19.379 --> 31:26.353
Now, as most of you already know by now, the
camp is now co-ed, which is a great thing!

31:29.691 --> 31:33.026
Obviously, there's going to be some programming
issues that we have to work through,

31:33.060 --> 31:37.498
but myself, the staff and your
counselors are totally committed

31:37.531 --> 31:42.302
to giving you a memorable
and safe summer.

31:44.171 --> 31:47.809
This... Jason, it, it's not a question
and answer period. Do you have to pee?

31:47.842 --> 31:51.411
Uh no, are we still going to be
doing Lumbermen versus Voyageurs?

31:51.445 --> 31:54.348
Oh, yes, absolutely, of course,
we are, Jason!

31:54.381 --> 31:57.785
Tomorrow after breakfast, we'll have
the traditional picking of the sides!

32:01.221 --> 32:02.189
I got an idea.

32:03.658 --> 32:05.325
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

32:05.359 --> 32:08.295
I doubt it. I'm just...
I'm kinda high right now.

32:08.328 --> 32:10.063
So just feels good all over,
you know?

32:16.169 --> 32:18.640
- See?
- See what?

32:18.673 --> 32:19.841
It's a vagina!

32:19.874 --> 32:22.644
No, it's your hands.

32:22.677 --> 32:26.046
No, you idiot, it's a vagina!

32:26.814 --> 32:29.149
Okay, everyone,
brush your teeth and shit.

32:32.787 --> 32:34.756
Okay, so the shrooms
have worn off, what's this plan?

32:34.789 --> 32:36.691
Right. For the team
picking thing tomorrow,

32:36.724 --> 32:39.359
you know, when they divide up
Lumbermen and Voyageurs.

32:39.393 --> 32:42.329
We gotta make it so all the boys camps are
Lumbermen, and all the girls' camps are Voyageurs.

32:42.362 --> 32:44.364
Sworn. Accelerate the conflict.
I like it.

32:44.398 --> 32:46.199
But how are we gonna swing that?

32:46.233 --> 32:48.201
- Who picks the names from the hat?
- Mr. Coffee?

32:48.235 --> 32:51.138
Mr. Coffee.
And what does Mr. Coffee like?

32:51.171 --> 32:54.207
- Murder?
- No. What else?

32:55.208 --> 32:57.444
- Booze.
- Yes.

32:57.477 --> 33:00.213
Amber, could you help me?
I need two lines.

33:00.247 --> 33:02.416
This line,
night-time medications.

33:02.449 --> 33:05.753
And this line, "My head hurts",
"My throat hurts", "Oh, my God!

33:05.787 --> 33:09.122
I've got poison ivy,"
"Hey, is that crotch rash."

33:09.156 --> 33:12.593
Alright kids, you heard Mr. Coffee,
two lines. Come on.

33:15.162 --> 33:17.130
So, what do you think the boys
have planned for us today?

33:17.164 --> 33:19.333
I don't know, Tiff,
maybe if we just don't push it...

33:19.366 --> 33:22.502
Amber, if we wait on it, our guard will
be down, and that's when they get us.

33:23.705 --> 33:27.207
I get it, we go all
passive-aggressive.

33:27.240 --> 33:31.679
You know like what if
we go on a sex strike?

33:33.447 --> 33:36.116
You haven't slept
with any of them, have you?

33:37.719 --> 33:40.888
Okay, sex strike might be
a little hard to pull off.

33:40.922 --> 33:44.224
One for you, one for me.

33:54.434 --> 33:56.871
I am a ghost!

33:58.372 --> 34:05.278
I was once a living person,
but then I died, so now I'm a ghost!

34:05.312 --> 34:07.581
Little redundant,
all that was implied.

34:08.950 --> 34:11.251
- Bahhhh.
- Boogadee Boo!

34:11.284 --> 34:14.388
Oh, fuck a cock!
Jesus, Coffee.

34:14.421 --> 34:18.191
You know, it's not nice
to scare people, in real life.

34:18.225 --> 34:20.862
Okay, look, we need
a favor from you, okay?

34:22.562 --> 34:24.699
Well, the price is right.

34:24.732 --> 34:26.199
What do you need?

34:26.233 --> 34:27.869
Well, look, we'll take care of
the how,

34:27.902 --> 34:31.873
but tomorrow, we need you to go
and rig the cabin selections

34:31.906 --> 34:33.608
for Lumbermen and Voyageurs,
okay?

34:34.809 --> 34:36.978
- Why?
- 'Cause we're going to make it Boys vs. Girls

34:37.011 --> 34:38.946
and take those hussies head on!

34:38.980 --> 34:41.883
Seems a little complex,
just to humiliate someone.

34:41.916 --> 34:43.550
Oh, yeah, how would you do it?

34:45.285 --> 34:49.724
Well, since you're asking I... I guess I
would ask them to meet me up someplace high,

34:49.757 --> 34:52.459
you know, like one of those
parking garage-type things.

34:52.492 --> 34:56.764
And I'd kinda, you know, as I'm talking
to them, move 'em closer to the edge,

34:56.798 --> 34:58.498
and make sure
I have solid footing.

34:58.532 --> 35:00.702
Then I'd kinda
push 'em off the roof.

35:00.735 --> 35:03.604
Then they'd, uh, you know,
fall to their deaths.

35:03.638 --> 35:07.008
And then I'd go around screaming "They jumped,
they jumped, I had nothing to do with it,

35:07.041 --> 35:09.576
it was one of those kind of
suicide-type things!"

35:11.578 --> 35:15.282
Coffee, you shouldn't be allowed to
work near children, you know that?

35:15.315 --> 35:16.617
Or people.

35:16.651 --> 35:18.552
I'm not.
That's why I'm at the camp.

35:22.623 --> 35:24.792
No, it's eight crackers
in one minute.

35:24.826 --> 35:27.995
No, I'm telling you, I got this
cousin in Salt Lake that says

35:28.029 --> 35:29.997
it's one cracker
in eight minutes.

35:30.031 --> 35:32.633
No! You're so stupid!

35:32.667 --> 35:36.838
That doesn't even make any sense, you can
easily eat one cracker in eight minutes!

35:36.871 --> 35:41.042
That's why it's hard, you have to
really take your time, savor it...

35:41.075 --> 35:45.378
Give it.
Time, go.

35:45.412 --> 35:46.981
My Swatch only shows hours.

35:48.082 --> 35:51.719
So, you see the fork?
It needs to go on the left, okay?

35:51.753 --> 35:53.688
No, I said it goes on the left!

35:54.689 --> 35:58.492
- Hey, Donna.
- Hi.

35:58.525 --> 36:00.628
Sorry. I... I just...

36:00.661 --> 36:03.898
You know, I could help teach your
kids how to set the table properly,

36:03.931 --> 36:05.532
with a little freestyle
of course.

36:05.565 --> 36:08.870
You know, something to
help them remember.

36:09.971 --> 36:12.372
- Yeah, sure, that would be great.
- Yeah?

36:12.405 --> 36:14.642
A'ight, cool. Here we go.

36:14.675 --> 36:17.344
Mm, yeah.

36:17.377 --> 36:21.048
<i>♪ It's like, when you Put down the

Hey, you got a sec?

37:31.819 --> 37:32.920
Freeze!

37:41.696 --> 37:43.097
What are they doing?

37:43.130 --> 37:46.167
- Girls' camp doesn't play freeze?
- No.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.837
Hell, you just yell "freeze" at some point
during the meal, the kids all freeze,

37:49.871 --> 37:53.040
and the first one to move
has to clear all the dishes.

37:54.474 --> 37:55.408
Neat.

37:56.443 --> 37:58.779
So, what's up?

37:58.813 --> 38:04.018
Right. Well, I do take it that guys'
camp did do program announcements, right?

38:04.051 --> 38:05.720
Yeah.

38:05.753 --> 38:07.520
Well, we have a big one
to announce this morning,

38:07.554 --> 38:11.993
with Lumbermen vs. Voyageurs
starting, and uh...

38:12.026 --> 38:14.729
Okay. So, do you have something
planned or?

38:16.197 --> 38:18.199
Yeah, yeah, um.

38:18.232 --> 38:21.168
You know, a few of us girls,
we came up with a skit last night.

38:22.637 --> 38:26.207
Actually, it was more like a rework of,
you know, something we did last summer.

38:26.240 --> 38:30.543
But we weren't sure if,
if we should just go ahead and do it

38:30.577 --> 38:31.846
or if you guys wanted to
participate?

38:31.879 --> 38:33.180
Now, Yoshi, don't laugh.

38:34.514 --> 38:36.984
Jason, don't fall in love, alright,
it's just a game there, pal.

38:37.018 --> 38:38.886
No, that sounds great.

38:39.954 --> 38:41.889
I guess we'll just leave this
one up to you guys... girls.

38:42.924 --> 38:45.492
Great, cool, thanks.

38:45.525 --> 38:48.029
Your breath smells like
farts!

38:48.062 --> 38:49.664
It's horrible.

38:49.697 --> 38:52.099
How bad does it smell?
Like farts, eh?

38:52.133 --> 38:55.002
Why don't you tell me about it
while you're doing dishes duty?

38:55.036 --> 38:57.738
Yeah, you didn't think
about it, did you?

38:57.772 --> 38:59.840
- So? What did they say?
- He said we could do it.

38:59.874 --> 39:03.177
- Yes! I knew it.
- Attack them with our sexuality.

39:03.210 --> 39:04.679
Sexual assault!

39:05.780 --> 39:08.448
Yeah, but different, you know.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.690
When the hand goes up?

39:15.723 --> 39:17.725
The mouth goes shut!

39:17.758 --> 39:19.226
Shut your holes!

39:19.260 --> 39:21.696
- Thank you, Ben.
- Shut your holes.

39:21.729 --> 39:23.064
Ben, the holes are shut.

39:25.733 --> 39:30.738
Okay, so, we have a special
announcement.

40:08.209 --> 40:12.146
May, maybe, maybe we shouldn't be
making enemies out of boobs, you know?

40:12.179 --> 40:16.817
It's Lumbermen vs. Voyageurs!

40:22.356 --> 40:26.593
Okay! For those of you who have been
here before, you know what this means.

40:26.627 --> 40:29.596
For those of you who are new,
let me explain.

40:29.630 --> 40:32.199
Yeah, so I guess that program
announcement didn't explain much.

40:32.233 --> 40:34.668
It was just sexual energy.

40:34.702 --> 40:37.104
...the Voyageurs
and the Lumbermen.

40:37.138 --> 40:42.176
These teams are going to compete
non-stop, around the clock,

40:42.209 --> 40:47.214
in various competitive activities
in order to accumulate points

40:47.248 --> 40:52.153
so that they can win
The Golden Axe-Paddle!

40:52.186 --> 40:54.288
- Looks like an axe.
- And a paddle.

40:54.321 --> 40:56.924
- Paddle.
- It's an axe-paddle.

40:56.957 --> 41:00.694
Before we get ahead of ourselves,
we have to make the selection

41:00.728 --> 41:06.100
to see which cabins will be the Voyageurs
and which cabins will be the Lumbermen.

41:06.133 --> 41:08.969
Lumbermen has won
the past four years, boys.

41:09.003 --> 41:11.571
- Okay?
- Let the selection begin!

41:14.008 --> 41:15.242
Alright.

41:15.276 --> 41:18.979
Who is first for the Voyageurs?

41:24.919 --> 41:27.321
Senior Girls 2.

41:31.959 --> 41:35.096
Alright, and now who is going
to kick off for the Lumbermen?

41:37.298 --> 41:39.900
Junior Boys 1.

41:43.404 --> 41:46.240
And back to the Voyageurs.

41:46.273 --> 41:47.708
It's working.

41:51.979 --> 41:55.716
Intermediate Girls 3.

41:57.118 --> 41:58.953
Lumbermen!

42:12.032 --> 42:13.200
It's the same.

42:16.270 --> 42:20.274
But the opposite, which would
make it... Intermediate Boys...

42:20.307 --> 42:23.244
Intermediate Boys 3!

42:26.747 --> 42:30.284
Coffee is way too liquored up to pull
this off. We're gonna get busted.

42:31.318 --> 42:32.987
He's got it, he's got it.

42:36.457 --> 42:39.059
Alright, next for the Voyageurs.

42:40.060 --> 42:43.330
Junior Girls 2.

42:43.364 --> 42:46.700
- Lumbermen?
- Senior Boys 2.

42:46.734 --> 42:51.005
Senior Boys 2, they beat me up
last summer, Senior Boys 2.

42:53.073 --> 42:54.341
Junior Girls 1.

42:57.811 --> 42:59.780
Intermediate Boys 2.

43:01.348 --> 43:05.319
Senior Girls 1.
Intermediate Boys 1.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.222
Intermediate Girls 1.

43:09.490 --> 43:11.325
Junior Boys 2.

43:17.064 --> 43:20.000
Oh. Intermediate Girls 2.

43:20.034 --> 43:25.339
Thank you, well, there you go!
Totally impartial selection!

43:26.440 --> 43:32.112
If the teams could please appoint a team
captain to come up here for the swearing-in.

43:41.155 --> 43:42.790
I swear.

43:42.823 --> 43:44.325
I swear.

43:44.358 --> 43:49.296
To compete with honor,
integrity, and spirit.

43:49.330 --> 43:53.500
To compete with honor,
integrity, and spirit.

43:57.137 --> 44:00.441
I know what you did here
and you will rue the day.

44:00.474 --> 44:03.277
I've always wanted to hear someone
say "rue the day" in real life.

44:03.310 --> 44:06.113
So I will now thus rue the day.

44:12.586 --> 44:16.056
<i>Our plan had worked.
We made it boys versus girls.</i>

44:16.090 --> 44:19.893
<i>This was our chance to show the ladies
who's boss and take back our camp.</i>

44:21.895 --> 44:27.134
<i>We knew the boys rigged the competition,
and we were determined to take them down.</i>

44:27.167 --> 44:29.203
This is no good,
we might actually hurt them.

44:30.938 --> 44:34.074
- British!
- Bulldog!

44:39.546 --> 44:43.217
Argh! Come on, you guys!
What was that?

44:43.250 --> 44:45.419
They have girl parts!
Where do we grab on to?

44:45.452 --> 44:47.988
The gender-neutral parts.

44:48.022 --> 44:49.189
British!

44:59.566 --> 45:03.404
Okay, you got four Voyageurs.
Switch up, Lumbermen run!

45:03.437 --> 45:04.972
British!

45:05.005 --> 45:07.341
Bulldog!

45:11.979 --> 45:15.449
- British!
- Bulldog!

45:18.519 --> 45:22.356
- Aw!
- Oh! Yeah.

45:22.389 --> 45:24.058
You work out, right?

45:25.592 --> 45:27.528
Okay, you captured 22 Lumbermen.

45:27.561 --> 45:29.530
Voyageurs win this round!

45:34.669 --> 45:38.105
Yeah! Go! Come on!

45:48.515 --> 45:50.384
- Yay!
- Woo-hoo!

46:04.498 --> 46:06.634
Oh, my God! Reeks of urine.

46:06.668 --> 46:10.070
Yes! It worked, it worked!

46:10.104 --> 46:11.939
We were trying to mask
the smell of poop!

46:11.972 --> 46:14.541
- Oh, well, congratulations.
- Yes!

46:17.244 --> 46:21.949
<i>A mid-summer dance probably
seemed like a good idea, on paper.</i>

46:37.564 --> 46:40.668
This is so lame.

46:40.702 --> 46:42.536
Okay, someone's gotta
do something.

46:42.569 --> 46:46.540
I mean, I get the feud, but the
kids aren't having any fun.

46:57.685 --> 46:59.621
- Hey.
- Okay, come on, we gotta do something.

46:59.654 --> 47:01.255
- Come on.
- What up?

48:16.163 --> 48:18.365
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

48:19.701 --> 48:23.103
Two cupcakes,
both for you fatty?

48:23.136 --> 48:27.140
No, no. I was... I was...
I was thinking of sharing.

48:27.174 --> 48:30.277
- With me?
- Yeah, sure.

48:31.813 --> 48:35.349
I, uh, I thought
we were enemies.

48:35.382 --> 48:37.551
Yeah, yeah, we are.

48:37.584 --> 48:42.289
But even enemies have to share yummy
delicious cupcakes from time to time.

48:42.322 --> 48:44.258
- They do?
- Yeah.

48:44.291 --> 48:46.761
- You haven't seen <i>Star Wars?</i>
- I've seen <i>Star Wars.</i>

48:46.794 --> 48:52.099
Okay, so just before Greedo shoots Han, you
didn't notice the cupcakes they were enjoying?

48:52.132 --> 48:53.701
Before Greedo shoots Han?

48:53.735 --> 48:55.502
You mean,
before Han shoots Greedo!

48:55.536 --> 48:58.372
What are you talking about?
Han would never do that.

48:58.405 --> 49:03.377
<i>Oh, God! I think he wants to kiss me.
Where was this confidence eight months ago?</i>

49:03.410 --> 49:06.113
<i>She kinda smells
like garbage,</i>

49:06.146 --> 49:09.416
<i>but that could just be because we're near
the dumpster and she was carrying garbage.</i>

49:09.449 --> 49:11.619
Han is a cold-blooded killer.

49:11.653 --> 49:14.756
You know instead of facing Jabba
himself and taking responsibility...

49:14.789 --> 49:18.392
<i>Wait, am I feeling attracted to
her or to the smell of garbage?</i>

49:18.425 --> 49:20.862
<i>I can't let him kiss me.
The girls will hate me.</i>

49:20.895 --> 49:23.463
You see that just
furthers my point,

49:23.497 --> 49:25.499
you're too busy moralizing to notice the
cupcakes that two enemies were enjoying.

49:25.532 --> 49:28.636
<i>But he's finally behaving
and acting cute.</i>

49:28.670 --> 49:31.271
<i>Maybe our union
could bring the camp together?</i>

49:31.305 --> 49:33.574
<i>Am I going to end up being
one of those case studies on</i> Donahue,

49:33.608 --> 49:35.475
<i>"The guy who humps
dumpsters?"</i>

49:35.509 --> 49:39.112
There is no way that they were
serving cupcakes at the cantina.

49:39.146 --> 49:41.548
Maybe some sense memory
would help you...

49:48.188 --> 49:50.625
Just say you love noogies,
and I'll let go!

49:50.658 --> 49:52.259
Let go first!

49:52.292 --> 49:56.396
Ha, ha, ha!
I hate noogies!

49:56.430 --> 49:57.732
- Dale?
- Yeah?

49:57.765 --> 49:59.466
- Dale!
- Yes!

49:59.499 --> 50:00.768
Were you just making out
with this hussy?

50:00.802 --> 50:02.169
- Excuse me?
- No.

50:02.202 --> 50:03.236
- No?
- Amber?

50:03.270 --> 50:04.806
You two were mouth fucking.

50:04.839 --> 50:07.140
Mouth fucking?
No one says that, man.

50:07.174 --> 50:08.643
We weren't.

50:08.676 --> 50:10.277
Then why do you have icing
on your boob parts then?

50:10.310 --> 50:12.479
They're called pecks on guys,
alright?

50:12.512 --> 50:15.182
- They're called pecks on her, too.
- Watch it.

50:15.215 --> 50:17.584
Yeah, what's with the
peck icing?

50:17.619 --> 50:20.822
This? You caught us
in the middle of a food fight.

50:20.855 --> 50:24.324
Yes, it was a hateful,
sexist food fight.

50:24.358 --> 50:27.160
Yeah, and I'm pissed at him right
now, and you're interrupting.

50:27.194 --> 50:29.363
Mm-hmm. I was waiting until now,
when she was wearing her favorite dress.

50:29.396 --> 50:31.899
- Fucker!
- Fight! Fight! Fight!

50:31.933 --> 50:35.535
- Really, this is how we're playing it?
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

50:35.569 --> 50:37.504
Fight! Fight! Fight!

50:41.709 --> 50:45.445
Okay, well, this camp is going
all girls, all summer.

50:45.479 --> 50:47.180
Roger sees
how toxic you guys are.

50:47.214 --> 50:48.850
Us? Toxic?

50:48.883 --> 50:51.351
You're the ones stinking up the
garbage with your maxipads.

50:53.253 --> 50:54.856
No, no, whoa... no.

50:54.889 --> 50:56.958
Two men enter, one man leaves.
Come on, you know these things.

50:56.991 --> 50:58.693
You want our maxipads gone?

50:58.726 --> 51:00.962
By the way, Dany is the only one
who uses maxipads, so...

51:00.995 --> 51:03.731
Yes, we want you gone!
There's no way it's just Dany.

51:03.765 --> 51:07.367
I've seen way too many maxipads in the garbage
for it just to be coming from one girl.

51:07.401 --> 51:09.637
Some of us have heavy flows!

51:09.671 --> 51:12.305
- Well, we want you gone!
- Well, let's lay down the stakes then.

51:12.339 --> 51:14.609
You want to play for keeps?

51:14.642 --> 51:19.614
Okay. Whoever loses Lumbermen vs. Voyageurs,
can't apply for a job next summer.

51:19.647 --> 51:22.382
No male counselors,
no boys' camp.

51:22.416 --> 51:26.621
- All girls, all summer.
- Okay!

51:26.654 --> 51:29.624
But if boys win
Lumbermen vs. Voyageurs,

51:29.657 --> 51:35.395
then girls can't apply for jobs here,
and it goes back to a... boys' camp.

51:35.429 --> 51:37.597
Yes, Ben, that was implied.

51:37.632 --> 51:39.332
Look, I'm just trying to
make the stakes clear.

51:50.544 --> 51:52.579
Okay, they're all in, let's go.

52:30.584 --> 52:33.788
Okay, looks like a hundred
spirit points for Lumbermen.

53:19.399 --> 53:22.569
Well, looks like a hundred and
fifty spirit points for Voyageurs.

53:22.602 --> 53:24.605
Woo!

53:25.572 --> 53:28.676
Go! Like the hustle,
I like the hustle.

53:30.678 --> 53:32.680
Hey, little girl? How you doing?

53:32.713 --> 53:34.715
Yeah, this is fun, huh?
Relay race camp.

53:34.749 --> 53:36.617
I love it.

53:36.651 --> 53:39.086
Just, it's kinda hard being away
from home this long, you know?

53:39.120 --> 53:43.825
I mean, I don't think I've ever been
away from my mom this long, have you?

53:43.858 --> 53:45.960
Yeah, sometimes I just
sit in bed at night,

53:45.993 --> 53:50.898
thinking about how much I miss my
mommy hugging me, singing to me.

53:50.932 --> 53:55.435
<i>♪ Hush, little baby
Don't say a word ♪</i>

53:55.468 --> 53:57.437
Comforting a child,
keep it moving.

53:57.470 --> 53:59.640
There's more important things in
life, okay? Keep going.

53:59.674 --> 54:04.078
<i>♪ Momma's gonna buy you
A mockingbird ♪</i>

54:18.458 --> 54:19.660
Yard sale!

54:29.502 --> 54:32.006
<i>We were so caught up
in beating each other,</i>

54:32.039 --> 54:36.077
<i>we didn't even see we were destroying
the one thing we both loved... the camp.</i>

54:38.179 --> 54:42.415
You two have no idea what
you have just done. No idea!

54:42.449 --> 54:43.818
Roger.

54:43.851 --> 54:47.054
Shut up, no one wants to
hear you talk, shut it.

54:48.656 --> 54:52.860
Do you have any idea,
the position you've put this camp in? Hmm?

54:52.894 --> 54:54.461
I'm asking you a question.

54:54.494 --> 54:55.796
You just told me to shut up.

54:55.830 --> 54:58.132
Shut up! It was rhetorical.
Shut it!

55:00.868 --> 55:04.605
Did you think that I, last summer
just, on my own, out of nowhere,

55:04.639 --> 55:05.907
decided to make the camp co-ed?

55:05.940 --> 55:07.008
Kinda.

55:07.041 --> 55:08.809
I thought I said to shut it.

55:08.843 --> 55:12.479
You told Dale to shut it,
this is my first shut it.

55:13.814 --> 55:15.950
Fine. But shut it from now on.

55:15.983 --> 55:17.584
Do you know why we're co-ed?

55:18.619 --> 55:21.588
Huh? Funny guy?
I'm asking you a question.

55:21.622 --> 55:23.157
Is it a rhetorical question?

55:23.190 --> 55:26.994
Oh, answering a question
with a question.

55:27.028 --> 55:29.030
Very smart funny guy.

55:29.063 --> 55:31.132
No, it wasn't rhetorical.

55:31.165 --> 55:33.000
- Okay then, my guess...
- Shut up! No one wants to hear you talk!

55:33.034 --> 55:35.468
Sorry, you're just being
a bit unclear.

55:35.502 --> 55:38.606
Oh. Well, pardon my French.

55:38.639 --> 55:40.207
How's this for unclear?

55:49.884 --> 55:51.252
Yeah. That's great for unclear.

55:51.285 --> 55:52.920
Oh, you want me to
spell it out for you?

55:52.954 --> 55:54.255
- Yes!
- Yes!

55:54.288 --> 55:56.223
Camps are closing
at a record rate.

55:59.526 --> 56:02.763
<i>Corporate has tightened
up budgets across the board.</i>

56:10.871 --> 56:13.540
<i>Parents are demanding
heightened safety standards,</i>

56:13.573 --> 56:16.143
<i>so more money is being pooled
into safety equipment.</i>

56:18.846 --> 56:23.516
<i>Going co-ed all summer long was the only
way to keep this camp economically viable</i>

56:23.550 --> 56:26.153
<i>and prevent corporate
from shutting us down.</i>

56:30.224 --> 56:33.995
That's why making this summer
work was so important.

56:36.263 --> 56:42.069
Look, first of, I... I really don't think the
outside world works the way you described it.

56:42.103 --> 56:45.139
Yeah, you make it sound like
a <i>Looney Tunes</i> cartoon.

56:45.172 --> 56:49.744
Like corporate bureaucrats
in suits bullying kids?

56:49.777 --> 56:52.646
Yeah, I... I... I really think
your world view is a bit off.

56:52.680 --> 56:55.649
Wait, how did you get visuals
of what was in my mind's eye?

56:55.683 --> 56:59.253
And second, I wish you would have just
leveled with us from the beginning.

56:59.286 --> 57:03.190
Just tell us that the camp was going
to close unless we made co-ed work.

57:03.224 --> 57:07.328
Yeah, if we knew it was that dire
we would have figured it out.

57:07.361 --> 57:09.764
You really just need to be
more clear next time.

57:09.797 --> 57:12.033
Well, but there isn't going
to be a next time.

57:13.334 --> 57:14.835
It's all too late anyway.

57:14.869 --> 57:16.237
Well, what do you mean?

57:17.905 --> 57:22.143
Corporate is sending an advisory board
tomorrow to check out our economic viability.

57:22.176 --> 57:27.915
Once they see this mess and the volatile
atmosphere, they'll close us down for sure.

57:34.955 --> 57:36.757
Come here, come here!

57:36.791 --> 57:39.226
Come here, come here, come here!

57:39.260 --> 57:44.999
I accidentally overheard while I was peeping
and I think I know how to save the camp.

57:46.367 --> 57:47.635
Follow me.

57:51.305 --> 57:55.743
Ninety-six bottles of beer on the wall,
ninety-seven bottles of beer on the wall,

57:55.776 --> 57:57.678
ninety-eight bottles of beer
on the wall.

57:58.846 --> 58:00.681
Ninety-nine bottle of beer
on the wall!

58:02.049 --> 58:08.255
When my dad passed away, he gave me
this job, and a small inheritance.

58:08.289 --> 58:10.958
That was almost fifty years ago.

58:12.293 --> 58:18.598
The job, the camp, the people...
are my home,

58:19.767 --> 58:21.335
my family.

58:25.005 --> 58:27.108
Economically viable?

58:27.141 --> 58:32.213
If keeping this camp open is
about money, I think I can help.

58:41.822 --> 58:48.395
Five thousand dollars.
The camp, our home, is saved.

58:48.429 --> 58:53.400
Yeah but your... that's your...
that's your inheritance?

58:53.434 --> 58:59.073
Yes, it was my dad's life savings,
but I want you to use it to save the camp.

58:59.106 --> 59:02.209
But you... you had it buried
underground the whole time?

59:03.310 --> 59:05.179
I think you're missing
the point here.

59:05.212 --> 59:08.349
This five thousand dollars
was from the 1940s.

59:08.382 --> 59:10.084
Almost fifty years ago.

59:10.117 --> 59:12.086
With inflation, and interest,

59:12.119 --> 59:15.156
you're looking at over a hundred
thousand dollars. At least.

59:15.189 --> 59:19.927
No, we're looking at
five thousand dollars.

59:19.960 --> 59:22.062
Now I think you're both
missing the point.

59:22.096 --> 59:26.400
1940s money, inflation,
interest.

59:26.433 --> 59:29.203
Ka-ching, camp saved, hero!

59:31.005 --> 59:36.110
Um, I think if we try to explain this to him,
we're just gonna get stuck in a time loop.

59:36.143 --> 59:38.179
Agreed.

59:38.212 --> 59:40.714
What... what if we just take the
money, tell him he saved the camp,

59:40.748 --> 59:44.785
and then use that money to spruce
up the place, and save the camp.

59:44.818 --> 59:47.888
You heard Roger,
corporate is coming tomorrow.

59:47.922 --> 59:49.890
That's why we're gonna need
everyone's help.

59:51.358 --> 59:53.994
Thanks! Woo-hoo!
You saved the camp!

59:54.028 --> 59:56.931
- Did you just call me a hero?
- Sure.

1:00:02.970 --> 1:00:05.806
Alright, I'm going to break it
down, nice and simple.

1:00:06.774 --> 1:00:10.277
Corporate is coming to the site tomorrow
and they're gonna close the camp.

1:00:10.311 --> 1:00:12.279
- What? What do you mean shut it down?
- What? Are you serious?

1:00:12.313 --> 1:00:14.415
- Listen. Listen. Please.
- Unless! Guys,

1:00:14.448 --> 1:00:19.820
unless we work together for the next
twenty-four hours and fix the camp.

1:00:19.853 --> 1:00:23.190
Fix the camp? How can we fix it?
What do you mean fix the camp?

1:00:25.192 --> 1:00:29.263
Okay, um, hold on a second,
guys. Look.

1:00:29.296 --> 1:00:33.234
Ben... here, try to break
this stick, okay?

1:00:33.267 --> 1:00:36.537
- Serious?
- It's easy, right?

1:00:36.570 --> 1:00:39.039
Good. Um, now look...

1:00:41.875 --> 1:00:43.978
Now go ahead and try to...
try to break this bundle.

1:00:47.081 --> 1:00:49.817
Haha, okay, just... no, let's
hold on a second, alright?

1:01:00.995 --> 1:01:04.965
- Fuck.
- Whoa, hold on guys, please. Okay.

1:01:04.999 --> 1:01:06.834
Okay.

1:01:06.867 --> 1:01:10.971
- Break this, let's give it a try.
- Woo!

1:01:11.005 --> 1:01:14.241
Goddamnit, Ben! Jesus Christ.

1:01:14.275 --> 1:01:17.044
Wait, wait, wait, hold up.
I think I get it.

1:01:17.077 --> 1:01:22.449
Wait, you're saying, on our own,
we can easily snap a twig in half.

1:01:22.483 --> 1:01:25.219
But if we work together, we,
we can snap a bunch!

1:01:25.252 --> 1:01:27.488
- A lot of sticks, bro!
- Yeah.

1:01:29.056 --> 1:01:34.428
It's like, we've had the power inside us the
entire time, to break a shit load of sticks,

1:01:34.461 --> 1:01:36.430
- more than we ever thought possible!
- Yes.

1:01:36.463 --> 1:01:39.366
No. I mean, yeah, but...

1:01:43.605 --> 1:01:47.341
Totally. Like with our friends,
and maybe, maybe some kicking...

1:01:47.374 --> 1:01:50.344
- Yeah.
- We can do so much more.

1:01:50.377 --> 1:01:52.112
A lot of sticks, dude!

1:01:52.146 --> 1:01:55.015
No, I mean, that's...
that's not...

1:01:57.017 --> 1:02:00.387
Wait sorry, are you guys... what,
is this... are you guys motivated by this?

1:02:00.421 --> 1:02:01.555
Fuck, yeah!

1:02:03.891 --> 1:02:06.360
- Alright. Yeah, okay, good.
- I guess we'll go with that!

1:02:06.393 --> 1:02:07.594
Thanks, everybody.

1:02:16.970 --> 1:02:18.572
We've got a way
to save the camp!

1:02:18.606 --> 1:02:21.342
I told you, it's too late.
Corporate is coming tomorrow

1:02:21.375 --> 1:02:23.977
We know, but we did this
metaphor thing with everyone,

1:02:24.011 --> 1:02:25.245
and we found
a little bit of cash.

1:02:25.279 --> 1:02:26.614
It's too late!

1:02:26.648 --> 1:02:29.049
They're going to shut us down.

1:02:29.083 --> 1:02:31.251
Or will they?

1:02:31.285 --> 1:02:34.922
- Uh, yeah, they will.
- Are you sure about that?

1:02:34.955 --> 1:02:37.391
Yeah, pretty sure.

1:02:37.424 --> 1:02:41.095
I know for a fact they're going to be closing
at least eight camps in this region alone.

1:02:41.128 --> 1:02:44.598
- We're bound to be one.
- Not so fast.

1:02:44.632 --> 1:02:48.001
Not so fast?
They're coming tomorrow!

1:02:48.035 --> 1:02:55.275
I wouldn't be so sure about us
closing... not just yet.

1:02:55.309 --> 1:03:00.247
Yep, I think something
might just change.

1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:02.149
- What?
- Roger.

1:03:02.182 --> 1:03:06.220
I wouldn't count all your
roosters before they hatch.

1:03:06.253 --> 1:03:10.324
Let's just see what a little
passing of the time can do, hmm?

1:03:21.168 --> 1:03:22.670
Montage!

Yeah, I know.

1:05:12.814 --> 1:05:17.351
This is... this is for sure the one
thing that we all have in common.

1:05:17.384 --> 1:05:19.419
What's that?

1:05:19.453 --> 1:05:23.625
That we all love this place,
and we don't want to see it go away.

1:05:25.627 --> 1:05:28.028
We figured that one out
in the end.

1:05:31.365 --> 1:05:33.400
So, how do you think
the review will go tomorrow?

1:05:34.468 --> 1:05:37.571
Honestly, I don't know.

1:05:37.605 --> 1:05:40.541
I just hope we didn't mess
things up for the kids.

1:05:51.285 --> 1:05:52.620
Do you think
you'll ever have kids?

1:05:54.454 --> 1:05:56.189
Yeah, eventually.

1:05:56.891 --> 1:05:59.560
I'd be an awesome dad.

1:05:59.593 --> 1:06:04.666
Ben, kids can't subsist on a diet
of Skittles and wedgies, man.

1:06:05.900 --> 1:06:10.404
Yeah, obviously, I'd make adjustments,
but I'd rise to the occasion.

1:06:10.437 --> 1:06:13.173
It's okay, Ben, not everyone's
cut up to be a dad.

1:06:14.876 --> 1:06:18.846
Are you guys serious right now?
Okay, look, fact!

1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:23.818
If you look back at all of humanity
as a whole, from the start, fact,

1:06:23.851 --> 1:06:26.386
most kids by far,
were just born.

1:06:26.420 --> 1:06:29.657
Just... just... just... just flopped
out of their mothers onto a bed,

1:06:29.691 --> 1:06:32.694
like a mossy, messy, forest bed.

1:06:32.727 --> 1:06:36.831
And then, most of the time, fact,
a wolf would just come along

1:06:36.864 --> 1:06:38.900
and... and eat the baby
right away.

1:06:38.933 --> 1:06:41.134
Just a snack, you know?

1:06:41.168 --> 1:06:44.504
So, by those odds, you know, if...
if you look at all the dads,

1:06:44.538 --> 1:06:49.611
from... from the start of humankind,
I'd be like in the top one percentile.

1:06:49.644 --> 1:06:54.214
Right, 'cause you'd at least try to fight
off a wolf from eating your newborn, right?

1:06:55.315 --> 1:06:57.384
Damn straight.

Oh, fuck my dick.

1:07:12.432 --> 1:07:16.236
This'll be an easy axing.
This place is a mess. Trust me.

1:07:20.942 --> 1:07:23.611
I still don't get why you're
both in the backseat.

1:07:26.246 --> 1:07:30.550
Wow, those bureaucrats look just like
how I pictured them in Roger's mind.

1:07:30.584 --> 1:07:31.686
I know.

1:07:32.787 --> 1:07:34.756
Chin up, Dale, we got this.

1:07:36.724 --> 1:07:38.726
Well, the front entrance
looks tidy.

1:07:56.911 --> 1:07:59.881
Uh, my summer?
Fascinating! Fantastic!

1:07:59.914 --> 1:08:03.417
You know, we all... we all
get along so well, you know.

1:08:03.450 --> 1:08:06.788
Everyone's pretty much my best bud,
you know, we... we get along great,

1:08:06.821 --> 1:08:09.924

a family, you know?

1:08:10.825 --> 1:08:13.226
I love this girl so much!

1:08:13.260 --> 1:08:16.698
You know, she's like the, uh,
the big, uh, little... little...

1:08:16.731 --> 1:08:19.533
little brother that I... I never had.
Get in here, get in here!

1:08:19.566 --> 1:08:24.972
Yeah, yeah, he's like a... he's like a...
little dog I keep in my purse.

1:08:25.006 --> 1:08:28.009
Yeah, you're a bad dog,
aren't you?

1:08:28.042 --> 1:08:30.577
Yeah. Gentlemen?

1:08:41.421 --> 1:08:44.892
Well, the toilets seem to flush
normally, unobstructed.

1:09:03.711 --> 1:09:06.346
Smells very... nondescript.

1:09:07.347 --> 1:09:08.816
Yes!

1:09:08.850 --> 1:09:10.885

1:12:50.838 --> 1:12:53.908
Nah, you just... you just
gotta play it chill.

1:12:55.009 --> 1:12:57.244
You're right, I'm chill.

1:12:59.546 --> 1:13:04.118

- Yeah, everyone did their part.
- Yup.

1:14:08.682 --> 1:14:13.254
It's too bad we couldn't have worked
things out earlier on, you know.

1:14:13.287 --> 1:14:14.955
We could have had
more time together.

1:14:14.989 --> 1:14:18.959
- Yeah, a DeLorean would be nice.
- Yeah, for sure.

1:14:20.127 --> 1:14:25.166
Yeah. I could go back and remind
myself to say sexy instead of slutty.

1:14:25.199 --> 1:14:27.334
Or you could've just shut up
and kissed me.

1:14:29.236 --> 1:14:30.603
Or that, yeah.

1:14:32.139 --> 1:14:34.842
But I get it though.

1:14:35.776 --> 1:14:41.916
Maybe... maybe we set something
up nicer for the next generation.

1:14:55.229 --> 1:14:57.665
- Maybe that's it.
- What?

1:14:57.698 --> 1:14:59.133
That's what kids are.

1:14:59.166 --> 1:15:02.803

like a time machine.

1:15:02.837 --> 1:15:05.106

and do it right.
