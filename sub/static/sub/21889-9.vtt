we are leaving for Japan in five hours.

I wanna check your bags,

my passport photo?

My bangs are a disaster.

01:33.301 --> 01:36.471
Well, you were the one
who told the barber, "Surprise me."

01:37.847 --> 01:39.766
-Jackson, are you packed?
-Yep.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.021
This is a garbage bag.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.148
Yep.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.443
And these clothes are dirty.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.614

01:56.074 --> 01:58.159

02:17.554 --> 02:18.429

02:19.097 --> 02:21.599

Kimmy, I don't have time
for your silliness.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.364

a bunch of potential donors,

02:36.447 --> 02:38.074
and if I'm gonna try to have a baby,

02:38.158 --> 02:40.118
I need to pick a baby daddy soon.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.203
Well, what about your boyfriend, Jimmy?

with an extra row of teeth?

02:58.177 --> 03:00.680

when the tooth fairy came?

03:02.473 --> 03:04.183
Look, I love Jimmy,

03:04.809 --> 03:07.478
but it is way too soon to ask
for a lifelong commitment.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.939
I don't want to put pressure
on our relationship.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.983
Promise me that you won't tell Jimmy.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.611
How about this? What if I only tell Jimmy?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.365

What are we looking for?

03:33.254 --> 03:34.547

Does it look anything
like the one in your pocket?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.055
What is wrong with me?

03:42.597 --> 03:44.682

05:07.557 --> 05:08.975
But is he perfect for DJ?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.644
There's only one scientific way
to find out.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.146
An online BuzzFeed quiz.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.608
Thanks to this quiz,
I knew I should marry Fernando.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.193
And divorce him.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.404
It's foolproof.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.657
And you're just the fool to prove it.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.368
Yes, I am.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.664
I am not putting Matt
through some stupid quiz.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.584
And now, I am over my little freak-out,

05:34.667 --> 05:37.628

to be going to Japan.

05:41.758 --> 05:42.967
Your passport's ready.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.768
Popko, I'm gonna miss you, too.

05:52.351 --> 05:53.394

-No. It's a beautiful poem.

while I'm away.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.136
Is that a joke?

06:27.970 --> 06:32.767
Ramona, you don't want me to be
all sad and lonely for five whole days.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.979
But if I get to hang out
with some other girls,

06:37.063 --> 06:38.731
it'll ease the pain of missing you.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.151
Let me make sure
I'm understanding correctly.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.694
Take your time, baby.

06:45.154 --> 06:47.782
You want to hang out with other girls

06:50.034 --> 06:50.952
Bingo.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.831
Well, how about this?

Well, let me give it to you Popko style.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.450
When we first started dating,
I was totally pumped.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.660
But as of right now,

07:32.994 --> 07:34.328
you're officially dumped.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.319
Of course.
Only the finest for first class.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.615
But, our boarding passes say
we're flying coach.

08:11.407 --> 08:12.950
Coach! [shudders]

08:14.702 --> 08:16.245
I flew coach once.

the tiny armrest and the lack of legroom.

And in-flight magazines with
the crossword puzzle mostly finished.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.717
Isn't first class expensive?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.344
Oh, very.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.680
But I never pay,
because I am notoriously cheap.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.642
I know.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.936
You gave me a roll of pennies
for my birthday.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.315
I threw them all in a fountain,
wishing for a real present.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.236
If I may continue my story...?

08:51.781 --> 08:54.700
To get into first class,
I dress to impress.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.871
And then I have a sob story
that no flight attendant can resist.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.876
And just to make sure,
I cry real tears, like so...

09:05.336 --> 09:08.130

09:19.809 --> 09:22.144

I don't blame you. Stephanie
should ask you to be her baby daddy.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.424
What?

09:52.049 --> 09:54.844
I'm sad
because I burned the last Pop-Tart.

Well, at least I kept Stephanie's secret
for 22 minutes.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.773
Why didn't Stephanie pick me
to be the baby daddy?

10:08.524 --> 10:10.443
She was afraid it was too much, too soon.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.946
Plus, there were lots of choices
in her donor files.

something new about DJ?

Come on, Matt. Focus.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.381

11:57.049 --> 11:59.218
Don't worry about it.
But this is your last chance.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.512
"Listening skills."

DJ, tell Matt about your crazy dream.

You've got this.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.810
I already told you about my dream,
remember?

12:08.561 --> 12:09.562
Remind me.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.566
I was a raccoon, and I robbed a bank.

12:13.649 --> 12:17.611

they look like old-timey bank robbers.

Really?

12:21.991 --> 12:26.245
Because you smiled and nodded,
and said, "Uh-huh," a lot.

12:27.746 --> 12:28.581
Uh-huh.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.544

in my other bag. I will be right back.

I love the lowlights, too.
I mean, it's a great contrast.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.901
I brought you a pillow for the plane.
I know your neck gets stiff.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.238
Oh, and also,
I did some research about your dream.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.406
Check it out. OK.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.992
The raccoon is a symbol of deception.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.412
You might be hiding some deep feelings,

even from yourself.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.667
See you guys at the airport.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.801
"What a man, what a man,
what a mighty good man."

13:23.928 --> 13:25.179
Found it, Deej.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.556
I made you a gift basket for our trip.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.767
All your favorite snacks,
in case you get hungry.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.603
Oh, honey.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.898
Aw! How considerate!

13:36.440 --> 13:37.316
Boom!

13:39.109 --> 13:41.987
It's got Dramamine. You told me
once you get motion sickness.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.031
What a good listener.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.574
Boom!

13:46.742 --> 13:48.786
I got you lavender-scented hand lotion

13:48.869 --> 13:50.913
because I know you love lavender.

13:53.290 --> 13:56.085
Aw! He pays attention
to the little things.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.129
I've got this one. Boom!

14:03.509 --> 14:04.468
Ramona.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.554
I just saw the news on Snapchat.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.264
You and Popko broke up.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.516
You must be devastated.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.227
I'm a little sad,
but I know I did the right thing.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.690
Oh, honey, you don't have
to put on a brave face for me.

14:17.773 --> 14:18.732
I'm your mother.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.276
You can cry on my shoulder.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.027
I don't need to cry.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.322
Yes, you do.
Don't hold in those tears.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.074
Mom, really, I'm OK.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.327
I'm not leaving this room
until I make you feel better.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.328
Now cry!

14:33.664 --> 14:34.623
Fine.

14:35.457 --> 14:36.917
[sobbing]

14:37.001 --> 14:41.005
Why, Popko, why?

14:42.548 --> 14:44.383
There, there.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.635
Mama's here.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.430
You just let it out.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.600
It feels so good to cry.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.687
Enough! Buck up!
We've got a plane to catch.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.400
Thanks, Mom.
You always know how to cheer me up.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.485
Even if you're the one who depresses me.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.614
It's my special gift.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.093
Good evening, Fernando.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.139
Young Max, what are you up to?

15:33.891 --> 15:38.062
Nothing.
I simply admire your sense of style.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.274
Ah! Splendid. Then carry on.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.027
And where is my carry-on?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.030
Here it is in my hand.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.907
How I carry on!

15:49.990 --> 15:51.867
[Fernando laughs]

15:53.786 --> 15:55.245
[shouts] Kimmy, Steph, let's go!

16:03.712 --> 16:05.506
Are you really
wearing that to the airport?

16:06.840 --> 16:08.425
Well, answer her.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.306
We're ready. Bye-bye, Tommy.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.725
-[Kimmy] We love you.
-See you in five days.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.436
Bye-bye, Ramona.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.775
Tommy,
I'm sorry we're not taking you to Japan.

16:25.567 --> 16:29.530
But you'll never know we left you behind,
until you see the pictures in ten years.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.367
Hey, hey, hey. Look who's here.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.538
Grandpa Nick.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.581
-[Stephanie] Hey!
-Grandpa Nick!

16:39.665 --> 16:40.541
Hi.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.458
Hi.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.252
[Stephanie] Hey. How are you?

16:43.335 --> 16:44.962
Hi. Look at you.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.506
Thank you for watching Tommy
while we're away.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.758
We're gonna have so much fun together.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.261
You like naps?

16:52.928 --> 16:55.723
And yelling at the TV news?

16:57.599 --> 17:00.060
Sweetie, I'm gonna miss you so much.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.355
All right. Bye-bye.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.356
That's it?

17:04.440 --> 17:07.443
Maybe next time you'll let me
all the way into the living room.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.114
Come on, Tommy,
we're gonna hit the early-bird special.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.742
You're gonna be my granny magnet.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.952
[laughing]

17:17.036 --> 17:17.911
Come on.

17:18.912 --> 17:19.747
OK!

17:19.830 --> 17:22.916
I've got Cosmo's food, squeaky toys,
and just one more thing...

17:23.500 --> 17:25.502
Why can't I be your baby daddy?

17:27.129 --> 17:28.255
Kimmy told you?

17:28.714 --> 17:30.883
Yeah, but she held out for 22 minutes.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.011
That's a new record.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.681
I don't want this
conversation right now.

17:39.141 --> 17:44.188
But... Is it because I'm not a genius,
or an artist, or a hotshot notary public?

17:45.606 --> 17:46.648
Hey, I love you, baby.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.863
OK, Max. Say goodbye to Cosmo.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.783
Goodbye, Cosmo.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.662
Lucky for you,
dogs have no concept of time.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.249
So, it'll only seem like I'm gone
for two seconds.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.878
But I do have a concept of time.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.048
It's gonna be the longest five days
of my life.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.930
It's time, Max.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.143
I'll call you when I land.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.688
[gasps]

18:27.272 --> 18:28.816
I can't remember his face.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.527
It's right there.

18:33.862 --> 18:36.782
Oh, yeah. He looks like
every other golden retriever.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.288
[DJ] Bye.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.130
Come on, Fernando. We're in the back.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.799
You go ahead. I will not be joining you.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.886
[mournfully] Excuse me.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.681
Do you have any tissues for my tears?

19:00.764 --> 19:04.476
My Japanese grandmother
is very, very sick.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.561
[attendant] Oh!

19:05.978 --> 19:07.646
I am so sorry to hear that.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.440
And the only thing that can ease my pain

19:10.524 --> 19:13.569
is seat 3B in first class.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.781
Unfortunately, that seat was just taken
by a young boy who, tragically,

19:17.865 --> 19:19.449
doesn't have long to live.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.788
Hello, coach boy.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.334
How did you beat me onto the plane?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.879
Unattended minors may board early.

19:32.796 --> 19:35.048
Look. The captain gave me his hat.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.010
That should be my captain's hat.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.263
Is there anything else I can get you,
Mr. Fuller?

19:41.346 --> 19:43.223
I'd love a few more months to live.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.474
Oh!

19:45.559 --> 19:46.768
Short of that,

19:47.186 --> 19:50.606
I'll take another ice cream sundae
to wash down this ice cream sundae.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.108
Coming right up.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.110
That boy is not dying.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.322
Not without a fight, I'm not.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.327
Sir, you are in 72A,

20:03.410 --> 20:05.412
by the restroom and those cranky babies.

20:05.495 --> 20:08.790
But the people in first class
would love my outfit.

20:10.667 --> 20:11.960
Stop this plane!

20:12.044 --> 20:13.378
I have to get on board.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.715
Sir, you are on board.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.259
Yeah.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.471
Sorry. I've been yelling that
since I got out of the cab.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.307
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

20:25.390 --> 20:27.226
I bought a one-way ticket to Japan,

20:27.309 --> 20:29.811
so that we could talk about
you trying to have a baby.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.605
[passengers] Aw!

20:32.105 --> 20:34.566
Why would you do it without me?
I'm your boyfriend.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.902
[passengers] Boo!

20:36.985 --> 20:40.530
I've got just as much to offer as any
of those other possible baby daddies.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.448
Watch this.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.744
Genius.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.180
Hotshot notary public.

21:06.723 --> 21:10.560
I need your driver's license, thumb print,
signature here, here, and here.

21:12.479 --> 21:16.066
-Yeah, he's a keeper!
-Just think about it, Steph.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.776
Your face,

21:17.859 --> 21:20.070
and my rock-hard abs.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.950
Our baby would be beautiful
and totally ripped.

21:27.077 --> 21:30.372
Thank you, Jimmy. But I am not ready
to have this discussion.

21:30.455 --> 21:34.042
Before we wrap this up, maybe we need
to see those abs one more time?

21:38.380 --> 21:42.301
Well, I need to get off the plane
since I couldn't afford a return ticket,

21:42.384 --> 21:44.845
and I really don't want to live
in Japan forever.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.472
But I've got to say just one more thing.

21:48.223 --> 21:50.851
There is no one
who will love you and that baby...

21:52.644 --> 21:53.854
more than I would.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.148
[passengers] Aw!

21:57.149 --> 21:58.984
If you're really up for this, then...

21:59.985 --> 22:01.278
I say...

22:02.154 --> 22:04.406
that we try to make a baby.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.536
[DJ whoops]

22:09.619 --> 22:10.495

22:10.996 --> 22:13.415
What? What? We stopped doing stuff?

22:21.465 --> 22:22.507
Hey, Kimmy.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.511
Can you sit with DJ for a bit? I need
to ask Stephanie something important.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.596
Sure.

22:27.679 --> 22:31.349
She's nine shampoos in, so
you'd better hurry before she nods off.

22:32.601 --> 22:33.518
Excuse me.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.603
[Stephanie] Seriously?

22:35.187 --> 22:36.104
Really, Kim--

22:37.064 --> 22:38.982
Thanks. Yeah. Hey, Steph.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.400
Whoa! Hi, Matt.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.154
So, what's up?

22:49.284 --> 22:50.535
Oh, my gosh.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.080
Matt, I mean, you're dating my sister.

22:53.163 --> 22:56.333
I mean, you know, sure,
I'm the fun, hot one.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.543
But, I mean, this is just...
This is wrong.

22:59.419 --> 23:00.837
Steph, this is for DJ.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.882
Look, I want to pop the question
when we're in Japan.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.343
Oh, wow!

23:06.426 --> 23:07.552
That is amazing.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.387
She'll say yes, right?

23:10.013 --> 23:11.431
Of course. She loves you.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.474
[exhales]

23:12.557 --> 23:14.476
That's great news because I love her.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.520
And I lost the receipt.

23:18.772 --> 23:19.606
One question.

23:19.689 --> 23:23.110
There isn't really a Team Matt
and a Team Steve, is there?

No!

23:43.630 --> 23:44.965

23:45.715 --> 23:46.591
Enough.

23:46.675 --> 23:50.220
I'm gonna listen to some Michael Bublé.
The shampoo's already kicking in.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.098
I'll see you in Tokyo.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.895
Kimmy, please go sit with Fernando.

23:58.979 --> 24:02.232
Between the cranky baby and the stinky
bathroom, I don't think he'll make it.

I'll try to calm him down.

This is driving me nuts.

24:26.339 --> 24:27.465
You were right.

24:27.549 --> 24:31.011
It is gonna be so hard
to watch Steve get married.

24:31.761 --> 24:35.557
I should have told him at the reunion that
I was gonna pick him to be my boyfriend

24:35.640 --> 24:36.516
instead of Matt.

24:45.817 --> 24:46.943
But it's too late now.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.614
I can't tell Steve.
It would totally freak him out.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.745
Yeah...

24:56.828 --> 24:59.122
You're right. There's nothing more to say.
