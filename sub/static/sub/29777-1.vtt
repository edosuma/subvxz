Hi.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.194
-What's your name?
-I thought I--

01:02.196 --> 01:03.262
-What?
-No, you go.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.396
Sorry what was it you said?

01:04.397 --> 01:06.265
Who are you out with?

01:06.267 --> 01:08.500
My housemate. He's over there.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.374
What's your name?

01:15.376 --> 01:17.209
-Ryan.
-No way.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.611
I had a rabbit called Ryan.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.681
Cool. How is he?

01:22.683 --> 01:23.782
Oh, dead.

-What's your name?
-Laura.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.130
I always said
if I had a daughter...

01:38.532 --> 01:39.731
You'd call her Laura?

01:40.835 --> 01:42.568
Well no,

01:43.370 --> 01:45.737
I'd probably call her
"Yet another, in a long line

01:45.739 --> 01:48.173
of women
that I cannot have sex with."

01:49.710 --> 01:52.678

that was a joke.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.881
I don't have a daughter, so,

01:55.883 --> 01:57.850
even if I did,
I'm not an incestuous pedophile.

this, she's left.

She always does this.

Do you want a drink?

02:17.471 --> 02:21.573
Uh, I-- I, should,
I should probably go after her.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.611
Then again, she'll have gone
to his house and...

02:25.613 --> 02:27.513
-So was that...
-Yes.

02:27.515 --> 02:31.316
Yeah. I'll have
a shot of Tia Maria.

He might
not even want to sleep with me,
he might not even like me.

No, he was pissed
the last time he saw me.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.782
That being
the only time he saw me.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.984
-He might...
-Do the bracelet test.

06:58.986 --> 07:02.554
-What's that?
-If you ever want to know
how someone feels about you,

07:02.556 --> 07:03.722
you do the bracelet test.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.191
If you genuinely like
this girl, Ryan,

07:06.193 --> 07:07.692
and I mean, genuinely.

07:07.694 --> 07:11.630
Do her. Girls like
the game of cat and mouse.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.499
It's a test.
They like to be pursued.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.736
Bring her here, rave
in her cave, pass the test,

07:17.738 --> 07:19.704
then you can have all the
bloody pilau rice you want,

07:19.706 --> 07:21.440
I'm going to Inferno's, ciao.

07:22.943 --> 07:26.044
Take off your bracelet
and discretely

07:26.046 --> 07:29.681
push it into his personal space
and see what he does with it.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.617
<i> If he pushes it away, he</i>
<i>probably wants to push you away.</i>

07:32.619 --> 07:35.620
He's not interested. If he
picks it up and plays with it,

07:35.622 --> 07:36.955
he wants to get closer
to you.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.091
<i> If he ignores it,</i>
<i> you get the gist.</i>

07:40.093 --> 07:44.930

he wants to be inside you.

Is his name Adam?

for ages. Anyway, no.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.262

-Yes.

-Have you got perfume on?
-I don't want perfume.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.683
I want him to smell
my pheromones. Mum!

08:38.684 --> 08:41.620
-What? It's ocean breeze.
-It's room spray!

08:41.621 --> 08:43.655
It's better than that
pheromones thing you put on.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.791

12:05.125 --> 12:06.791
-Sorry I'm late I...
-Oh, don't be,

12:06.793 --> 12:07.959
-you're not late.
-...I came from Pilates.

12:08.795 --> 12:09.861
Sorry where?

12:10.464 --> 12:11.963
No.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.768
-I...
-Shit, come in, sorry.

12:17.270 --> 12:22.040
-Oh.
-Ooh. It's lovely.

12:22.042 --> 12:25.243
-I'll give you
a tour if you like.
-Okay.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.078
Er...

12:28.849 --> 12:30.381
Oh! [both chuckle]

12:31.284 --> 12:33.885
-It's Dan you live with,
isn't it?
-Yeah.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.121
-Yeah.
-Yeah, but he's out clubbing.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.455
[loudly] Clubbing!

12:40.293 --> 12:41.493
Okay. Um...

12:42.929 --> 12:46.831
This is a hallway.
Through there is the kitchen.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.340
This is indeed a kitchen.
[chuckles]

12:56.543 --> 12:58.409
Through there
is the living room.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.345
Ooh.

13:00.347 --> 13:04.916
-These are stairs
or broken escalators.
-Very lovely stair--

13:04.918 --> 13:06.484
Oh, or broken escalators.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.319
[cracking wood]

13:13.460 --> 13:16.528
Bathroom there,
Dan's room there.

13:16.530 --> 13:20.131
That's a cupboard
and this is the boudoir.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.400
Ooh, nice.

13:23.537 --> 13:26.538
-Very tidy.
-Ah, well not really,

13:27.107 --> 13:29.307
there's a few plates there
from last night,

13:29.309 --> 13:31.176
a cup over there.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.411
Right.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.917
What's this? Secret room?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.819
It's a toilet, yeah.

13:40.821 --> 13:41.920
What an en suite?

13:41.922 --> 13:46.090
-I've always wanted
one of these.
-Oh.

13:55.335 --> 14:00.104
Wow. So, you've got
the biggest room then?

14:00.473 --> 14:02.207
Yeah, the master bedroom.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.442
Because I am the master.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.144
[both laugh]

14:09.082 --> 14:11.950
-Do you want a drink or...?
-Yes, please.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.453
We have Cobra, um...

14:17.057 --> 14:18.122
Port...

14:19.226 --> 14:21.926
Ribena... milk.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.931
Um. I've never had port.

14:26.933 --> 14:29.000
Great, well port it is.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.002
-I'll just get you some.
-Okay.

14:41.014 --> 14:44.916
Um... do you want a hand
with those drinks?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.661
Do you want a hand or anything?

14:58.598 --> 15:02.600
No. No. I'm fine.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.273
Right, well I just-- I'll wait
in the living room then.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.109
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:20.954 --> 15:24.022
-[upbeat music]
-[phone ringing]

15:27.260 --> 15:29.928
-Didn't take long did it?
-Where's the Port?

15:29.930 --> 15:32.964
-The what?
-Didn't we have a bottle
of Port, where is it?

15:32.966 --> 15:37.235
-Is she there yet or what?
-Obviously, I'm not drinking
fucking Port by myself, am I?

15:37.237 --> 15:40.271
Fuck the port, if you want
to get her there's five steps.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.641
I'm going to tell you,
but you can't tell nobody else
I'm going to write a book.

15:43.643 --> 15:48.379
-Where is the Port?
-Compliment her,
mirror her, ask her questions,

15:48.381 --> 15:51.482
teasingly put her down and steer
the conversation towards sex.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.151
I know,
but this isn't a book.

15:53.153 --> 15:57.221
Then you fuck her.
Six steps, new book. Boosh!

15:57.223 --> 15:59.991
I've found the Port.
I've found the Port.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.026
Right calm down!
Calm down.

16:02.696 --> 16:05.196
Where were the glasses,
do we have any glasses?

16:05.198 --> 16:07.465
<i> Yeah,</i>
<i> well there's one in my room.</i>

16:08.601 --> 16:11.436
But I piss in that when I can't
go to the toilet. Up to you.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.604
Right, I've got to go
I'll call you later.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.373
<i> All right mate, bye-bye.</i>

16:16.276 --> 16:18.476
You're a proper dickhead,
you know that?

16:23.717 --> 16:25.183
Ta da!

16:27.120 --> 16:31.622
-Wow.
-I'm sorry about the cup,
all our glasses are in shops.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.994
So how have you been?

16:35.996 --> 16:39.998
Good, yeah.
Ooh, is that Irn-Bru?

16:40.433 --> 16:42.433
Port and Irn-Bru, yeah.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.303
All the celebs are drinking it.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.071
It's Meryl Streep's favorite.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.440
And you only drink what,
Streep drinks?

16:49.442 --> 16:53.511
Yeah, just Cobra
and Port and Irn-Bru.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.781
Oh, that's classy.

16:56.783 --> 17:01.619
God, I'm so sorry, I didn't know
there was someone else in here.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.255
-Are you Dan?
-No that's--

17:07.394 --> 17:10.294
-not, not Dan, Dan's out.
-Oh.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.030
Yeah.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.531
-You all right, mate?
-Yeah,

17:14.534 --> 17:17.568
just got a little bit
of the old, dead skin

17:17.569 --> 17:20.238
forming on the sole
of my foot there. So,

17:20.673 --> 17:23.340
going to hit that up later on
once it's softened up,

17:23.343 --> 17:27.111
but it does take time.
A little bit egotistical,

17:27.113 --> 17:30.148
but so important
to look good, isn't it?

17:33.787 --> 17:37.221
-Do you want
to see the garden?
-Sure.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.724
-See you.
-Oh, lovely, yeah, all right.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.359
[door closes]

17:42.462 --> 17:44.262
[Laura] Garden's gorgeous.

17:45.231 --> 17:48.266
It's a movement sensor,
you've got to keep moving.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.367
Right.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.104
Who was that?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.374
-I don't know.
-What?

17:56.843 --> 17:59.610
As in he does live here,
but I don't know his name

17:59.612 --> 18:01.512
that's why
I couldn't introduce you.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.148
[laughs] Just ask him.

18:04.150 --> 18:07.285
I can't.
He's been here like a month.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.654
I've been calling
him Adam, or Alex.

18:09.656 --> 18:13.157
Dan calls him Abel.
But he responds to all of them.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.828
[laughs] I honestly
didn't know he was there.

18:16.830 --> 18:20.364
I know.
It's like that all the time.
He's got no presence at all.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.632
Oh!

18:23.603 --> 18:26.437
-[Laura] Are you waving or what?
-It should come on in a sec.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.874
-There we are. Oh! Shit!
-Ah!

18:30.710 --> 18:33.578
How did you get out here
without setting the light off?

18:33.580 --> 18:38.149
Didn't know that we had a light.
Oh, motion sensor, is it?

18:38.151 --> 18:40.751
-Yeah, it should be.
-Right, that's it then.

18:40.753 --> 18:44.755
No. No, those things never
pick me up for some reason.

18:44.757 --> 18:50.595
Automatic doors, automatic
dryers, automatic toilets,

18:51.531 --> 18:53.431
can never go back to Japan.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.237
So, we going out then or what?

19:00.907 --> 19:03.241
Well, I was thinking we could
stay in here for a bit.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.209
[scrubbing]

19:06.713 --> 19:10.648
But I thought we said we were
going for a meal or something.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.485
Well, yeah,

19:15.855 --> 19:18.890
but then I thought we could
watch a film or something.

19:20.560 --> 19:24.195
You don't want to go
for a drink at a bar?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.266
Well, I have drinks here.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.172
In fact, I was going to grab
another beer. Just one sec.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.508
[man] Sorry, old friends,
left it too long.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.553
I left these out earlier.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.889
I'll put them away
in case you trip.

19:55.929 --> 19:58.829
-You lift weights, do you?
-Every day.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.768
How many do
you normally do?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.604
About one hundred a day.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.241
Oh. Wow.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.609
I'll show you,

20:11.611 --> 20:13.377
-if you don't believe me.
-No.

20:15.782 --> 20:19.417
One. Two.

20:19.419 --> 20:22.820
Three. Four. [panting]

20:22.822 --> 20:28.593
All day. Four. Four.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.263
-Five.
-Oh.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.265
Just like that really.

20:34.267 --> 20:37.468
I could do more, but you know.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.552
What we going to watch then?

20:55.822 --> 20:58.422
Oh, yeah, whatever you want.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.025
I've got-- I've got
all the Pixar films.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.727
All right.

21:03.329 --> 21:09.400
Okay. Scarface?
X-Men, Godfather trilogy.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.970
-Ooh. Oh.
-Oh, or there's my laptop there.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.573
We could watch whatever you
want. I've got Netflix.

21:16.676 --> 21:17.775
Oh.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.886
Oh, there's so
much Pikachu that's cute.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.655
-[man] Fuck yeah.
-[Pikachu] Pika.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.423
-Shit!
-Shit.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.824
No, no, no, no.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.427
-That's...
-<i> Pika, Pika.</i>

21:36.429 --> 21:39.297
Dan. He took that, the laptop.

21:39.299 --> 21:43.301
-Oh no, no, no, no, Dan.
-<i> You, filthy custard slag.</i>

21:43.303 --> 21:47.838
I think he's just,
he's looking on YouTube or like,

21:47.840 --> 21:50.541
it would have come up on
the side or something and he

21:50.543 --> 21:54.412
wondered why people were into
it. I don't think he's into it,

21:54.414 --> 21:56.647
probably thought
it was a bit weird, so.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.758
Pikachu's a slag
then, eh? Who knew?

22:07.760 --> 22:11.595
Yeah. Well, I don't.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.732
I've not seen that.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.007
-Can I use your
bathroom a minute?
-Yeah, sure.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.409
-You know where it is.
-Yep.

22:29.415 --> 22:30.481
Oh.

22:41.928 --> 22:45.129

23:29.075 --> 23:34.478
No? Or <i> Cruel Intentions</i>
which may be more to your taste?

23:35.014 --> 23:38.783
Than Pixar Pokémon porn?
Doubt it. [laughs]

23:40.186 --> 23:42.153
I'm only joking,
<i> Cruel Intentions</i> .

23:42.922 --> 23:44.054
A fine choice.

23:55.468 --> 23:55.833
Right, sorted.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.606
Do you want a top up
before it starts or?

24:02.608 --> 24:05.109
Er... No, I've still
got plenty thanks.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.011
[ <i> Cruel Intentions</i> begins]

24:09.849 --> 24:13.484
Sit up here if you like?
Probably see it better.

24:14.754 --> 24:15.820
Yeah.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.758
Get on properly.

24:21.928 --> 24:22.993

-Yeah.

-<i> Nobody's unfixable.</i>
-<i> Yes, I am, a text-book...</i>

24:53.192 --> 24:55.860
Did you know that this
was actually the film

24:55.862 --> 24:58.929
that Ryan Phillippe
and Reese Witherspoon
met before they got married?

24:58.931 --> 25:01.765
-No way.
-Yeah. Yeah.

25:01.767 --> 25:03.033
Wow.

25:05.238 --> 25:09.573
-Isn't she that actress
that got stabbed? Reese..
-Witherspoon.

29:41.981 --> 29:44.481
No, that's not how
you do an emergency call.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.283
I found a body just one body.

Pikachu's quite pretty.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.895
It's a drawing
of a cat, thing.

29:58.531 --> 30:00.497
He says he's agoraphobic,
that's a lie,

30:00.499 --> 30:02.833

30:02.835 --> 30:05.969
-Stop being so scared.

I can't have sex with him.
It's too soon.

who thinks I have intermittent
agoraphobia held hostage

30:31.964 --> 30:37.367

because they will shrink
in the heat.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.579
This isn't 50 shades
of fucking Gray, Bink.

-<i> Be dominant, man.</i>

31:29.188 --> 31:30.621
Tell her to get in the bed,

The bedroom rules,

31:32.958 --> 31:35.893
-That's dogs.
-<i> This one works for both.</i>

31:35.895 --> 31:38.328
Right before you fuck,
look her in the eye and say,

31:38.330 --> 31:42.666
"You might not enjoy
this, but by God,
you'll remember it." Okay?

Sex, sex, sex. Sex.

-Do you want me to do anything?

41:29.621 --> 41:32.922
No, no. Sorry.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.591
Ah.

41:40.499 --> 41:41.898
<i> Come on!</i>

41:48.106 --> 41:50.039
Sorry.

41:50.041 --> 41:53.877
Sorry. [moaning]

41:53.879 --> 41:56.813
[phone ringing]

42:03.788 --> 42:04.888
Okay.

42:12.264 --> 42:14.030
[phone continues ringing]

42:19.771 --> 42:21.671
-Sorry about that.
-It's okay.

42:24.643 --> 42:28.845
-I'm usually better.
-As am I.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.192
-Just going to nip to the loo.
-Okay.

42:45.997 --> 42:48.197
[phone ringing]

42:57.008 --> 42:58.174
[door closes]

43:00.178 --> 43:02.178
Oh.

43:04.716 --> 43:06.349
[slow music]

43:11.990 --> 43:13.289
Oh.

43:14.326 --> 43:16.726
Well, there we are.
All done.

43:18.597 --> 43:20.630
It was-- it was nice
seeing you again.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.298
Yeah and you.

43:23.335 --> 43:26.135
And thanks for, for everything.

43:26.137 --> 43:29.372
No, no worries. No probs.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.241
-Bye.
-Hey.

43:33.378 --> 43:34.644
Oh.

43:42.654 --> 43:43.920
Bye.

43:48.059 --> 43:49.325
Just...

43:55.700 --> 43:56.766
Bye.

44:04.843 --> 44:09.078
[Ryan] I'm waiting out here.
Are you alright?

44:09.080 --> 44:11.881
-Wait.
-Oh, they hurt so bad.

44:11.883 --> 44:14.317
-Why would you hurt yourself?
-I don't know.

44:14.319 --> 44:16.753
-Here, let me take these.
-Ah.

44:16.755 --> 44:19.088
-I'll give you a piggyback.
Get on.
-Yes.

44:19.090 --> 44:21.658
-Come on. Get on.
-Yes, yes, yes.

44:21.660 --> 44:25.061
Get on. Jump, jump.
Oh no, whoa, whoa.

44:25.997 --> 44:28.965
Oh, my God. Is this
how you see the world?

44:28.967 --> 44:31.934
-Yep.
-Everyone looks tiny.

44:34.172 --> 44:37.340
Wait, wait. Look how I see it.

44:38.877 --> 44:41.310
Wow! You're a borrower.

44:41.312 --> 44:44.781
-You're a borrower.
-I think one of us is a freak.

44:44.783 --> 44:49.052
-Yeah, I think it's you.
-Well, I think
we should ask this guy.

44:49.054 --> 44:53.056
Hey, excuse me, which one of us
would you say is a freak?

44:53.058 --> 44:54.323
Fuck off.

44:56.461 --> 45:00.296
-That was my dad.
-[laughs]

45:03.768 --> 45:05.401
-Hey.
-Have a chip.

45:06.337 --> 45:07.970
[slow music continues]

45:14.746 --> 45:15.812
Oh.

45:18.116 --> 45:21.050
-Laura. Laura.
-What?

45:21.720 --> 45:22.885
It's that way.

45:44.142 --> 45:45.208
I'm sorry...

45:46.778 --> 45:49.278
about this, all of it.

45:50.081 --> 45:52.515
-About what?
-The whole thing.

45:55.019 --> 45:58.354
I just-- I haven't-- um--

46:00.358 --> 46:03.493
I suppose you're going to go,
so it doesn't really matter.

46:04.329 --> 46:05.928
I, um,

46:09.400 --> 46:11.868
I haven't ever
really done this before.

46:13.204 --> 46:15.438
I don't mean
that I have done that,

46:15.440 --> 46:18.007
though it didn't look
like it, but I have.

46:19.444 --> 46:20.510
Never well.

46:23.381 --> 46:26.449
I haven't been with anyone
in a while and

46:26.451 --> 46:30.153
I fucked it.
Again, not well.

46:30.822 --> 46:34.056
Sorry-- I'm-- I don't know
what I'm trying to say, um.

46:35.226 --> 46:36.993
I'm sorry
I didn't take you out.

46:39.230 --> 46:41.964
I should have. I panicked.

46:43.935 --> 46:46.035
I don't know--
I don't know how to do this.

46:46.037 --> 46:47.570
I don't either.

46:47.572 --> 46:49.338
Oh, no you do.
You definitely do,

46:50.041 --> 46:51.908
the confidence and the dancing.

46:51.910 --> 46:54.577
Oh, God, no,
that bit wasn't strong.

46:55.513 --> 46:56.579
I liked it.

46:59.918 --> 47:02.318
So, what you don't usually
take girls to your bedroom

47:02.320 --> 47:04.921
-on a second date?
-[chuckles]

47:04.923 --> 47:07.023
I don't usually have
second dates to be honest.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.527
I haven't met anyone
that I like in a while,

47:12.897 --> 47:14.197
or that likes me.

47:15.567 --> 47:19.235
Is that because of an ex
or you're just not that...

47:19.904 --> 47:21.137
into women?

47:23.274 --> 47:27.543
You don't have to tell me,
I'm not like one of those
girls that's like "Who is she?

47:27.545 --> 47:30.246
Do you still see her?
Does she still love you?
Do you still love her?

47:30.248 --> 47:32.548
do you? Do you?" [chuckles]

47:32.550 --> 47:34.116
Do you?

47:39.157 --> 47:43.292
-[Ryan] Oh.
-Shit! Ryan!
Why aren't you at your mums?

47:43.294 --> 47:46.062
Why are you having sex
with James?

47:46.064 --> 47:48.497
I wanted to talk
to you about this.

47:48.499 --> 47:52.101
-About what?
-Me and James.

47:54.138 --> 47:58.040
-We're seeing each other, yeah.
-Pull out a minute.

47:58.042 --> 48:05.181
[panting]
Oh, Ryan. I'm so sorry.
I just knew you'd be so upset.

48:05.183 --> 48:08.050
I was going to talk to you about
it over a weekend or something,

48:08.052 --> 48:11.354
but well,
at least you know now.

48:14.092 --> 48:16.459
Where are your pants?
Put them on for a start.

48:16.461 --> 48:19.395
-I'm pretty hot in here.
-Yeah.

48:19.397 --> 48:22.131
The central heating's faulty,
you don't get the dial spot on

48:22.133 --> 48:24.400
the temperature goes
up and up and up.

48:24.402 --> 48:27.937
-You could take a look at it?
-Yeah, we can look at that.

48:30.275 --> 48:31.374
On my count.

48:33.311 --> 48:33.609
Release it now.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.616
-Perfect.
-[Ryan crying] You didn't count.

48:41.452 --> 48:43.052
That'll do it.

48:47.292 --> 48:48.357
Thanks.

48:49.427 --> 48:53.195
Oh, my God. That's so shit.

48:53.197 --> 48:56.399
-Ah, the temperature's
fine though.
-Ah.

48:58.169 --> 49:01.637
-How long were you together?
-Two and a half years.

49:01.639 --> 49:05.308
-Shit.
-I mean, it's fine now,
like I've-- you know, I--

49:06.210 --> 49:09.312
we don't hang out or anything,
but like I'm not mad.

49:14.352 --> 49:16.385
It's too cold
to be standing out here.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.525
Do you want to come back?

49:25.697 --> 49:26.963
Yeah.

49:29.033 --> 49:30.700
-Amazing.
-[chuckles]

49:33.638 --> 49:37.707
[Ryan] <i> What about you then?</i>
<i>You've got to tell me about you,</i>
<i> if I'm telling you all this.</i>

49:37.709 --> 49:41.010
Fine. Right, but you have
to ask the questions, okay?

49:41.746 --> 49:47.583
So, me and my ex we finished
five months ago. Go.

49:47.585 --> 49:51.120
-Okay. Was it serious?
-Yes.

49:51.122 --> 49:53.522
-How long were you together?
-Six years.

49:54.392 --> 49:56.258
-Six years?
-Yes.

49:58.096 --> 50:02.732
-Um... Did you live together?
-Yes.

50:02.734 --> 50:04.500
-Are you married?
-No.

50:04.502 --> 50:06.202
-Were you married?
-No.

50:06.204 --> 50:07.436
-Engaged?
-Yes.

50:07.438 --> 50:09.705
-What happened?
-You can't do that.

50:09.707 --> 50:12.041
-What I have to guess?
-Yes.

50:13.378 --> 50:15.745
-Did one of you cheat?
-No.

50:15.747 --> 50:21.117
-Did he-- oh God.
He's not dead, is he?
-No.

50:21.119 --> 50:23.019
Oh, God. I was going to say
this game is awful.

50:23.021 --> 50:25.321
Fine, I'm just going
to tell you, okay?

50:25.323 --> 50:31.127
So, it started about a year ago
when he told me he was bisexual.

50:31.596 --> 50:35.231
-And you were fine with that?
-Well, yeah pretty much.

50:35.233 --> 50:37.666
I was like
"Do you still fancy me?"

50:37.668 --> 50:40.102
And he was like, "Yeah."

50:40.104 --> 50:41.504
And when I thought about it,

50:41.506 --> 50:43.706
I thought I kind of fancy
Jennifer Aniston.

50:44.509 --> 50:47.576
-Sometimes I imagine
what she must smell like.
-Coconut.

50:48.546 --> 50:52.348
Yes.
I've always said piña colada.

50:52.784 --> 50:56.819
-I think she uses a lot
of scented body lotions.
-Exactly.

50:58.056 --> 51:01.357
Okay, so anyway, I was in bed,

51:01.359 --> 51:03.492
it must have been
like 3 A.M. or something,

51:03.494 --> 51:07.263
-I woke up and he wasn't there.
-Shit.

51:07.832 --> 51:10.166
But I could hear noises
coming from downstairs.

51:10.168 --> 51:13.235
So, I got up, I went down
and there was in the living room

51:13.237 --> 51:16.605
-fiddling with the ornaments.
-Is that like code for...

51:17.208 --> 51:20.176
No, no just actual ornaments.

51:20.178 --> 51:22.211
Like a little dish
and a wooden cat thing.

51:22.213 --> 51:23.646
-That's weird.
-I know.

51:23.648 --> 51:25.347
And I say to him

51:25.349 --> 51:29.118
-"Are you okay?"
-And he's like, "No."

51:29.120 --> 51:31.487
Obviously, he's fiddling
with ornaments at like 3 A.M.

51:31.489 --> 51:35.124
And he says, "Okay, so you know
a couple of months ago

51:35.126 --> 51:38.094
-I told you I was bisexual?"
-Which you did.

51:38.096 --> 51:39.862
Which I did, yeah.
So, I say, "Yeah."

51:39.864 --> 51:45.101
And he says,
"Well I'm not. I'm gay.

51:46.637 --> 51:48.838
I'm sorry. I'm gay."

51:48.840 --> 51:50.639
And what did you say?

51:51.676 --> 51:54.210
Well, I told him that
I thought it was a bold move

51:54.212 --> 51:56.378
for the marriage,
but that it was okay

51:56.380 --> 52:00.116
because he still fancied me.
And then he just stared at me

52:00.118 --> 52:04.420
and kept repeating,
"I'm gay. I'm gay. I'm gay.

52:04.422 --> 52:08.257
-I'm gay. I'm gay. I'm gay."
-And...

52:08.259 --> 52:11.694
-"I'm gay". Yep.
-Did you see that coming, or?

52:11.696 --> 52:15.831
Well, looking back now I can
kind of see the signs but...

52:15.833 --> 52:17.600
Did his boyfriend give him away?

52:17.602 --> 52:19.268
No. I--

52:20.538 --> 52:22.238
that was such a dad joke.

52:22.240 --> 52:24.440
-I'm sorry.
-[chuckles]

52:29.280 --> 52:30.263
Ah.

52:30.264 --> 52:31.247
So, you just had
to stop everything.

52:31.749 --> 52:33.682
-Yeah.
-I guess you would have to.

52:33.684 --> 52:37.219
-We had a house and everything
together so.
-Oh.

52:37.221 --> 52:40.422
To start with I was like,
"We can still live together.

52:40.424 --> 52:42.358
We can be mates and all that."

52:42.360 --> 52:44.560
But that really didn't work out.

52:44.562 --> 52:48.164
So, I'm back
with my mom for now,

52:48.166 --> 52:50.232
and if all of that
didn't happen,

52:50.234 --> 52:52.334
I'd be getting married
next week.

52:54.539 --> 52:55.571
[door closes]

52:56.207 --> 52:57.907
So, is that your only ex then?

52:58.509 --> 53:00.643
No other women
I have to fight off.

53:00.645 --> 53:04.413
-You're going to fight them?
-Yeah, why not?

53:05.316 --> 53:07.850
That cheating one
sounds like she deserves
a punch in the face.

53:09.654 --> 53:13.756
Well, I'm kind
of a big deal so um--

53:20.464 --> 53:22.331
No there've not been many.

53:23.768 --> 53:26.602
And how many is not many?

53:28.539 --> 53:29.805
Ah.

53:32.443 --> 53:34.310
Are you just
making up a number?

53:34.312 --> 53:35.711
What? No.

53:36.280 --> 53:39.215
-I'm just trying to remember.
-You're going to lie.

53:39.217 --> 53:40.749
How many have you had then?

53:41.719 --> 53:44.920
-Uh...
-See, now you're going to lie.

53:44.922 --> 53:46.689
[knocking on door]

53:49.760 --> 53:51.393
It's not going to be for me.

53:51.395 --> 53:53.796
No, it's going to be Dan,

53:53.798 --> 53:55.698
he probably is going
to want to speak to you.

53:55.700 --> 54:00.369
-He's been drinking so don't
believe anything he says.
-[knocking continues]

54:01.439 --> 54:04.440
Just go get him,
I won't judge you I promise.

54:05.376 --> 54:06.976
[whispering]
I have already judged you.

54:11.515 --> 54:12.848
[Ryan] Ow.

54:13.951 --> 54:15.751
Where are you keys?

54:16.787 --> 54:19.688
-[suspenseful music]
-You made me give you
them back.

54:20.958 --> 54:23.659
Please don't shut the door
just hear me out.

54:24.962 --> 54:28.297
-What are you doing here?
-I came here to talk to you.

54:28.299 --> 54:30.332
I called you like nine times.

54:30.334 --> 54:32.001
You didn't pick up
which I understand,

54:33.271 --> 54:34.737
but please can I come in?

54:35.740 --> 54:39.408
No. I'm on my way to bed.

54:39.410 --> 54:44.880
I'll be like ten minutes.
Five minutes. Max.

54:44.882 --> 54:48.517
-Don't call me...
-Don't call you Max,
I know, I remember.

55:04.001 --> 55:06.835
-Where's Dan?
-He's out.

55:11.008 --> 55:14.710
-Are you okay?
-No, sorry. I'm--

55:15.980 --> 55:19.648
drank some wine and--
all the wine. [chuckles]

55:22.887 --> 55:24.386
James and I broke up.

55:27.725 --> 55:29.658
Fucked up, massively.

55:30.361 --> 55:33.362
[tension music]

55:35.399 --> 55:36.598
I love you.

55:39.370 --> 55:40.869
I keep thinking about you,

55:41.539 --> 55:44.039
hoping that I'll bump into you
and what I'm going to say.

55:45.476 --> 55:46.842
Does that sound pathetic?

55:47.812 --> 55:49.011
[door closes]

55:50.348 --> 55:53.482
-Is that, Dan?
-Give me two seconds.

55:53.484 --> 55:54.983
I thought you said he was out.

55:58.823 --> 56:00.989
-I found baby Ryan.
-No,

56:00.991 --> 56:03.392
no that's,
it came with the frame.

56:03.794 --> 56:05.361
-It didn't.
-Genuinely,

56:05.363 --> 56:06.929
I don't know that baby.

56:08.699 --> 56:11.633
Okay. You all right?

56:11.635 --> 56:15.771
Yeah, no I'm--
that's-- it's not Dan in there.

56:16.841 --> 56:18.774
It's my dad.

56:18.776 --> 56:21.510
And he's,
he's in a pretty bad way.

56:22.546 --> 56:23.979
Should I leave? I should leave.

56:23.981 --> 56:26.115
No! You can't leave.

56:26.117 --> 56:29.051
He'll see you.
Can you just wait here?

56:29.053 --> 56:31.987
-I'll get him to leave.
-You don't have to do that,
it's your dad I don't--

56:31.989 --> 56:34.690
It's fine, it's fine,
can you just stay here?

56:34.692 --> 56:37.092
-Give me two minutes.
-Okay, yeah.

56:41.098 --> 56:42.398
Hello.

56:43.734 --> 56:47.136
-Hello. Listen.
-[moans]

56:47.138 --> 56:50.906
I am really, really grateful
for you coming over

56:50.908 --> 56:53.876
and saying this,
but can I call you tomorrow

56:53.878 --> 56:55.444
when this sunk in?

56:56.714 --> 56:58.847
Aren't you even going
to open your present Ryan?

56:58.849 --> 57:01.650
-Yeah, I'll open it tomorrow.
-No, do it now.

57:01.652 --> 57:03.419
Can you please stop shouting?

57:04.889 --> 57:06.822
[tension music]

57:15.199 --> 57:16.632
Is that James?

57:16.634 --> 57:20.102
Well yeah, I didn't have
a photo of us two together.

57:20.104 --> 57:24.506
Look, Ryan, you tell me
what to do and I will do it.

57:24.508 --> 57:26.041
I won't fuck up this time.

57:26.043 --> 57:29.445
Why don't we watch
the Godfather trilogy

57:30.648 --> 57:33.549
and how about I give you
your real present?

57:37.788 --> 57:39.855
I promise I will
call you tomorrow.

57:40.458 --> 57:41.990
Oh, God.

57:45.496 --> 57:47.796
[crying] Ryan.

57:50.868 --> 57:54.503
That's it. Be quiet, shh.
Up you come. Come on, that's it.

57:54.505 --> 57:56.472
That's it. There we go.

57:59.777 --> 58:02.211
-At least let me get
my bloody shoes.
-Shh.

58:03.214 --> 58:05.013
[whispering] You stay here.

58:05.015 --> 58:06.248
Yeah, all right, Dad.

58:09.186 --> 58:10.953
Always forgetting them.
[chuckles]

58:15.726 --> 58:17.226
There goes one.

58:20.731 --> 58:22.831
Can I use
your toilet before I go?

58:24.001 --> 58:26.535
-No. It's broken.
-What about your toilet?

58:26.537 --> 58:28.804
That's also broken.

58:28.806 --> 58:30.906
There's something wrong
with the water level

58:30.908 --> 58:32.641
and the toilets won't fill.

58:32.643 --> 58:34.209
The toilets
are broken, honestly.

58:34.211 --> 58:36.278
Right, well how do
you go to the toilet?

58:36.280 --> 58:38.280
We use the sink,
or McDonald's.

58:38.282 --> 58:39.915
It depends on the number.

58:57.268 --> 58:58.767
I miss you.

59:00.237 --> 59:03.005
-Oh.
-Ryan, look at me, will you?

59:03.007 --> 59:06.275
I stayed with him
because I hated myself
for what I did to you.

59:06.277 --> 59:08.143
I will never forget that look.

59:09.079 --> 59:10.312
[loud noise]

59:10.314 --> 59:17.586
Have either of you two seen
my assorted biscuit tin?

59:30.167 --> 59:32.868
-Hiya.
-All right?

59:34.305 --> 59:36.138
[tension music]

59:44.949 --> 59:46.315
You can keep those.

59:49.987 --> 59:51.320
Beth?

59:51.322 --> 59:52.654
Laura?

59:54.224 --> 59:57.025
How-- how did
you know I was here?

59:57.027 --> 59:58.193
I didn't.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.163
Why are you here?

01:00:01.966 --> 01:00:04.766
-Why is she here?
-You know him?

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:06.835
-Do you two know each other?
-Yeah.

01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:09.671
I-- are you two
in this together?

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:11.073
Is that what this is?
What is this?

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:12.174
Oh, my God.

01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:17.980
You're Ryan, Ryan. He's--
he's pissy Ryan? Oh, my God.

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:20.983
-Are you two on a date?
-Whoa, why am I pissy Ryan?

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:25.087
Why did you say pissy Ryan
and she said yes?

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:27.623
The time you had loads to drink
and pissed the bed.

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.691
-Are you two on a--?
-What three years ago?

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:32.995
That night? That happened
one time, one time.

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:35.197
-You pissed the bed loads.
-One other time

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:37.165
and otherwise
it's been dry nights.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:39.134
Dry nights Ryan
should be what you call me.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:43.405
-Are you two on a date?
-No.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:46.108
No, no, so why are you here?

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:49.845
-Don't you live in Wales now?
-Yeah.

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:52.381
-You came from Wales, here?
-It was the Megabus.

01:00:52.383 --> 01:00:54.216
It's fine. It's cheap.
It's fine.

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:57.152
Is this your idea
of getting back at me?

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:59.354
-Is it?
-No, I'm not.

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:02.324
I don't know what this is?
What is happening here?

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:04.426
Beth is who I was
out with on Friday.

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:06.261
And is this your ex Beth?

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:09.131
[crying] I don't believe this.

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:13.769
Beth I-- I didn't know
that that was pissy Ryan

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:16.204
-or dry nights Ryan.
-How do you two know each other?

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:18.774
Beth, if I'd have known that
I wouldn't have come here,

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:22.411
-and you know that.
-Fine, fine.

01:01:22.413 --> 01:01:24.246
You two stay,
I'm going to leave.

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.114
I'll let you get on
with your little sex party.

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:28.183
Oi, why did you say
it was your dad?

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.352
I didn't-- I don't
know what I'm supposed to say.

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:31.887
This is going well, isn't it?

01:01:32.723 --> 01:01:33.989
I'm going to go.

01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:36.058
-No.
-No, no, no, stay.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:39.327
-It's what you want, isn't it?
-Beth, stop it.

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:42.030
No. We'll let him choose.

01:01:43.267 --> 01:01:44.833
Pick one.

01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:52.908
-I'm going to go.
-No, you are going to stay

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:55.377
because clearly
you're the one he wants now,

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:59.081
unlike last week when you
were texting me asking was
I all right, saying goodnight,

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.718
like pretty much you have done
for the past two years,

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.921
telling me you love me,
you miss me.

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:13.361
-Here we go.
-Oh, no don't--

01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:15.497
Listened to "The man
who can't be moved."

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:19.301
"Made me think of you." Wait.
Yeah, this is a really good one.

01:02:20.471 --> 01:02:25.040
"Miss you, still can't find
a girl who compares to you."

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:29.111
-[door closes]
-¶<i> Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo</i> ¶

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:31.279
-High five.
-[girl laughs]

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:34.382
You see Ryan this is Tali.
Tali this is Ryan.

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:39.221
Tali teaches Yoga,
and yeah, Tali, Ryan.

01:02:39.223 --> 01:02:41.323
Yeah, is it shoes or no shoes?

01:02:42.526 --> 01:02:46.328
Hiya, Tufts. This is Tufts,
Ryan's ex-girlfriend,

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:48.363
who cheated on him
in this living room in fact.

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:50.899
That's why we don't have
a sofa anymore, isn't it?

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:53.468
-My name's Beth.
-Yeah, but we call her Tufts

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:56.071
because once happened
she shaved herself

01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:59.274
and when the pubes grew back
came as these like tufts,

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.243
looked like individual popcorns.
I'm sorry.

01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:03.979
I didn't see it,
definitely not,

01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:06.882
but you told me it was rough
as fuck, didn't you?

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:09.217
This lady I have definitively
never laid a gander on.

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:12.420
I'm assuming, you're the girl
Ryan's trying to have sex with.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.190
-[Tali] Hello.
-[Dan] Tali everybody!

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:17.492
-Woo!
-Woo, woo, woo!

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:20.295
Well, Laura,
why don't you tell me

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:23.098
how long has this
really been going on for?

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.302
Nothing's been going on.
I only met him like last Friday.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:32.440
Friday! What?
When you were out with me,
to cheer me up? Thanks.

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:34.910
-You left.
-Yes, because I was upset.

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:37.212
-What you two
know each other?
-Seems like it.

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:41.917
So, you took me out,
let me leave and then pull
my ex. Great plan!

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:43.585
Why are you making out
like I planned this?

01:03:43.587 --> 01:03:46.254
I didn't even know
he was your ex,

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:48.990
and do you know what maybe we
could have realized this sooner

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:51.226
if you'd actually asked
me about my date tonight,

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:53.094
or you'd called me like a mate.

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:55.297
Oh, yeah, yeah that's it.
You mean like earlier,

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:57.866
when you texted me asking me
for an emergency phone call

01:03:57.868 --> 01:04:00.001
because quote
"It is desperately needed."

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.503
and I'm not making this shit up.

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:03.972
-Look, Ryan.
-Put your phone away.

01:04:03.974 --> 01:04:08.410
Now, I don't know if now's
a good time but has anybody lost
a pair of these?

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:10.545
-Ouhg.
-Is that one of yours?

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:17.886
That looks so much worse
and oddly so much better
than it actually is.

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:22.224
Look, I'm not going to argue
with you, I barely know the guy.

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:24.926
So, you two have obviously
got a lot to go through.

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:27.329
-I'm going to leave you
to it, okay?
-No honestly, Laura

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:30.432
-That-- it's not what you think.
-Ryan! Ryan.

01:04:30.434 --> 01:04:33.134
-Really it looks bad, but--
-I'm done here, okay?

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:37.205
I've wanted someone that wanted
something else for years

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.241
and it, it doesn't work.

01:04:43.614 --> 01:04:44.980
[sighs]

01:04:50.354 --> 01:04:51.953
Oh, wet towels.

01:04:51.955 --> 01:04:56.925
-[door closes]
-[Tali] I've always been like,
"A raisin is a raisin.

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:59.561
It's its own fruit,
and then Dan was like,

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:02.497
"It's a shriveled up, grape."
I was like, "What?
Did you know this?"

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:04.232
-He told me.
-Really?

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:05.967
-Yeah.
-Tell us something else.

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:15.243
Women are fucking crazy.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:18.346
Laura is, I'm not. Anymore.

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:19.648
You okay?

01:05:21.184 --> 01:05:22.450
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:26.521
[upbeat music]

01:05:26.523 --> 01:05:28.323
Okay. Goblin,

01:05:28.325 --> 01:05:30.292
-where are you from?
-[imitating a goblin's voice]
Dublin.

01:05:30.694 --> 01:05:33.361
How will you be
leaving this club later?

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:38.967
-[imitating] Stumbling.
-Okay, okay.

01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:40.502
-Seriously now.
-Yes.

01:05:40.504 --> 01:05:43.305
How do you find the current
situation in Syria?

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:48.176
-[imitating] Troubling.
-Yes.

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:53.048
Um, what was it like receiving
the Nobel Peace Prize?

01:05:56.053 --> 01:05:59.487
-It was very...
-[imitating] Humbling.

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:02.157
-Yeah.
-Yeah. All right!

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:07.062
-Don't worry about it.
-About what?

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:10.031
-About being on a date
with my friend.
-I'm not.

01:06:11.001 --> 01:06:13.969
You've been
seeing one of my friends
for the last two years, so--

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:15.704
Okay, we all know
what's happened.

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:19.107
Why don't I open
that champagne, yeah?

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:22.477
You'll even like champagne.
It's made from grapes.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.245
Oh, better not I'm pregnant.

01:06:25.048 --> 01:06:26.982
You're-- what did you say?

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:30.418
[Beth] Ryan, where are
the champagne flutes?

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:34.356
You know, where are they?

01:06:34.358 --> 01:06:36.458
Baby, where are your glasses?

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.559
-I'll--
-Don't.

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:40.562
-[Beth] Why?
-We don't have any glasses.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.464
Please let me get her a glass.

01:06:42.466 --> 01:06:44.299
-No.
-All right.

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.634
I don't understand this.
You've been

01:06:46.636 --> 01:06:49.137
texting me, sending me flowers,
pretty much begging me

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:53.308
-to get back with you and now--
-I sold my fucking couch!

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:57.078
And now you're back here
like nothing happened

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.582
-and looking for glasses?
-What's the deal
with the glasses?

01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:03.051
But all those texts
and messages that I sent you,

01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:05.120
you didn't reply to one,
not a single one.

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:07.622
I know and I'm sorry,

01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:10.125
but if we want to make this work

01:07:11.395 --> 01:07:13.161
you have to move on.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.467
-Baby...
-Yeah, I have.

01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:21.169
From you.

01:07:22.506 --> 01:07:23.605
Baby.

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:27.409
You're going
to have to leave now.

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:29.577
Get out.

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:31.646
Please get out.

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:40.455
You're not actually
doing this, are you?

01:07:40.457 --> 01:07:45.660
One date with my mate,
a few reps and suddenly
you're the big man.

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:48.530
I came here for you.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:52.133
You came here for yourself
because James left you.

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:55.336
-Laura's right.
-Laura's an idiot.

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:59.140
She's an idiot
who doesn't make me feel totally
shit about myself all the time.

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:01.509
-Still an idiot though.
-Come on.

01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:04.345
Please, get out.

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:10.251
Please, leave.

01:08:18.862 --> 01:08:21.261
[door opens]

01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:23.798
I'll raise
that child as my own.

01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:27.669
I'm not really pregnant.

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:34.676
[GPS] <i> Head southwest</i>
<i> for thirty meters.</i>

01:08:34.678 --> 01:08:36.344
Which way is southwest?

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:40.448
You made your choice
"pissy pants Ryan."

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.785
Hope you and "I would rather
be married to a gay guy"
are very happy.

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.553
You certainly
fucking deserve each other!

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.189
Ah.[gasps]

01:08:49.192 --> 01:08:50.892
Ah, oh!

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:55.430
-See, she did deserve a punch
in the face.
-Ryan!

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:58.800
-Laura!
-Shut up. Ridiculous.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:03.571
Right,
where is southwest? That way?
Where does the Megabus go from?

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:05.673
You can kiss
goodbye to your job.

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:07.809
You haven't got the authority
to sack me, Beth.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:10.778
-No, but Marion does, when she--
-Marion hates you.

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:12.779
She fucking hates you.

01:09:15.285 --> 01:09:17.719
[groans]

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.587
-Marion loves me.
-[Laura] Slut!

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:24.459
-Which way is it? That way?
-No, no, wait, Laura, Laura.

01:09:24.461 --> 01:09:27.362
I'm so sorry for--
I didn't mean to lie to you.

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.898
She just turned up and I didn't
know what I was supposed to do.

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:32.533
I know this has got to be
like the worst date ever.

01:09:32.536 --> 01:09:33.600
This isn't a date anymore.

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:34.903
-No?
-Nope.

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:36.270
[slow music]

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.640
Shit do you want
a jacket or something?

01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:41.209
No. I'm fine.

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:43.444
Look, I don't know
which way southwest is,

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:45.680
it's probably that way.
But would you

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:49.283
please just come in,
just for one minute.

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:50.752
I know I don't deserve it.

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:52.953
-Do you love her?
-No.

01:09:53.924 --> 01:09:57.559
No. Honestly, no.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:02.430
Laura, Laura, I am so sorry.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.667
I didn't mean for any of this.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:11.773
I-- would you please just come
in, please let me explain.

01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:15.543
-Yeah, come inside, Laura.
-Yeah, babe, come inside.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:18.213
-Yeah, come inside you.
-Stop talking, please!

01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:19.581
[Dan] Fine.

01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:27.522
Fine.

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:30.358
-[all] Yeah! Yeah!
-She's coming in!

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:33.695
Oh, please, please,
some room thank you.

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:41.302
Thank you. So much.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:46.574
Do you want a drink?
I've got champagne, genuinely.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:50.378
It's still in a cup,
but the caliber of drinks
has skyrocketed in here.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:53.281
Do you want one?

01:10:54.818 --> 01:10:55.850
Sure.

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:06.527
-[champagne bottle opens]
-Whoa, wow, wow. Oh. So erotic.

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:07.829
[both laugh]

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:10.698
-Whoa! Take it easy.
-I'm so...

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.867
Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.

01:11:15.405 --> 01:11:18.039
-To Streep.
-Always to Streep.

01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:22.543
So, Goblin.

01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:27.048
-How's the champagne?
-[imitating voice] Bubbling.

01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:31.819
-I thought you'd forgotten.
-I didn't forget.

01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:35.823
-Ah.
-I am so glad
you can't read maps.

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.825
I can,
it's just that first bit.

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.794
I couldn't have had you
going back to Wales thinking

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.796
I was an even worse
Ryan than Ryan the Rabbit.

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:44.499
Oh my God. How do
you know about my rabbit?

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:49.404
Because you kept talking
about him, for hours, genuinely.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:52.807
I don't know why?
He was a shit rabbit.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.676
Don't say that now.

01:12:08.525 --> 01:12:12.060
-Oh. [yawning]
-Oh. That good, am I?

01:12:12.062 --> 01:12:14.629
-Sorry.
-Are you tired?

01:12:14.631 --> 01:12:17.098
-Yes, a bit.
-Thought you were
French kissing.

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:19.534
Is this a date then?

01:12:20.337 --> 01:12:22.537
No, I don't think
we should ever date.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:25.673
That would be ideal.

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:33.881
That's sweet.
This is actually some
really nice stuff you guys.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.818
-Shall we go upstairs?
-Yeah.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:40.922
-No, you don't have to do this.
-I do.

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:46.060
Just let me get the champagne,
in case we do really have...

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:49.997
All right. Come on.
Mind your head, whoa.

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:51.699
[Laura] Ooh-hoo.

01:12:52.435 --> 01:12:55.136
[Ryan] Ready, ready boys?
Strong legs them private!

01:12:55.138 --> 01:12:57.071
[Laura laughs]

01:12:58.575 --> 01:13:02.510
[Dan] You might not enjoy this,
but my God you'll remember it!

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:05.146
-[Tali] What is wrong with you?
-[Dan] Just joking.

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:09.417
-[Tali] What is this? Piss?
-[Dan] Yes.

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:13.988
-Oh, my God. You're disgusting.
-Why? It's just piss.

01:13:14.758 --> 01:13:17.091
-Oh, oh it stinks.
-No, it doesn't.

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:18.993
It was in the morning.
Stay here one minute.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:21.562
-[Tali] No.
-I love you.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:22.997
[door closes]

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:25.600
Oh. I didn't see you there.

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:27.435
Oh, I shouldn't worry,
it happens a lot.

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:32.607
I'm Tali.

01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:37.145
Tali, I'm A...

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:39.013
Ah... Right.

01:13:39.616 --> 01:13:43.951
So, we have banana,
or that could just be yellow.

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:46.821
This apparently
makes everything burn.

01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:49.590
-Uf... Not that.
-I don't like those either.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:53.027
We have ribbed
or glow in the dark.

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:56.431
I'd prefer it if my cock
doesn't glow to be honest.

01:13:56.433 --> 01:13:59.133
Banana.

01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:00.701
Right.

01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:13.080
Come here.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.493
No, that's just yellow.

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:27.228
[both chuckle]

01:14:28.765 --> 01:14:30.097
It's just yellow.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:42.810
You ready? Do you want
me to do anything?

01:14:44.247 --> 01:14:45.813
Nah.

01:14:49.853 --> 01:14:50.852
All right.

01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:53.821
-You all right?
-Yeah.

01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:56.657
-Oh.
-Oh.

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:58.826
-Ah. Okay.
-Oh.

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:07.768
-Okay.
-Yeah.

01:15:09.539 --> 01:15:12.940
[both moaning]

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:16.844
No...

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:25.052
-No!
-Oh, dear.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:26.921
[both laugh]

01:15:26.923 --> 01:15:29.891
-Did you come?
-Yeah.

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:33.194
-I did, but I can keep going.
-Can you?

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.731
No. I'm sorry.

01:15:36.733 --> 01:15:39.066
That's okay.
It's fine, it's fine.

01:15:42.005 --> 01:15:43.571
Sorry about that.

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:50.912
Hey, it was much better
than last time.

01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:53.781
Yeah. It was, wasn't it?

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:55.149
So, imagine next time.

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:57.118
