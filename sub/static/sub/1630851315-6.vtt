Okay, and why would I do that?

41:49.594 --> 41:50.769
No reason.

41:50.812 --> 41:52.901
Unless...

41:52.945 --> 41:57.471
Perhaps the order came
from someone.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.518
Say, someone at Langley.

42:03.999 --> 42:06.001
Maybe you're not
as retired as you claim.

42:09.527 --> 42:13.835
Janie, secrets may be
the enemy to intimacy,

42:13.879 --> 42:15.576
but...

42:15.620 --> 42:18.187
they sure are fun.

42:18.231 --> 42:19.667
[chuckles]

42:27.632 --> 42:28.720
Gin?

42:28.763 --> 42:29.764
Your deal.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.566
