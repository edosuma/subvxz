[intercom ringing]

01:05.080 --> 01:06.360
Yo, where's the rest?

01:07.040 --> 01:09.360
Are you fuckin' deaf or something?
Where's the rest?

01:10.200 --> 01:12.920
Aight, where are you, bruv?
I got your food, fam.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.200
Aight, listen, call me back
when you get this, though, man.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.880
Ain't nothin', bro. Love, love.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.880
Shit, man. Look at you.
You're proper jealous and that.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.560
Shut up! Dickhead.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.400
You guys, man.

01:27.560 --> 01:28.400
Yo, yo, yo.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.240
Oh, shit! ZTs!

01:33.240 --> 01:34.400
[man] Go, go, go!

01:43.080 --> 01:45.080
What the... What the fuck you doing, man?

01:45.240 --> 01:46.720
[grunting]

01:46.800 --> 01:48.240
Get the fuck off me, man!

01:48.520 --> 01:49.360
Ay!

01:50.640 --> 01:51.880
Get the fuck off me!

01:52.600 --> 01:54.640
- [yelps]
- ZTs, bruv!

01:55.160 --> 01:57.880
[screaming]

[ambient music fades out]

02:08.919 --> 02:12.640
[onlookers chattering quietly]

02:33.120 --> 02:34.400
Which one of 'em was it?

02:35.600 --> 02:38.360
Bruv, I don't even know.
I don't even know the youngers like that.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.800
But they were connected to us
and that's enough.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.360
My thing's more about who done it, innit?

02:43.840 --> 02:47.240
But fuckin' acid, though, bruv.
Like, when did that start happening?

02:47.480 --> 02:49.320
But that shit ain't new, though,
you know.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.720
That's been happening.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.600
Them things, they're easy to get hold of,
easy to use.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.280
That kid's gonna be scarred up
for life, though.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.240
[Sully] Mm.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.560
And I say that's Jamie making his move.

03:07.040 --> 03:07.960
Nah.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.120
That's a warning shot, bruv.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.200
Trust me.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.640
If he was gonna start a full-scale war,
he would've come for me or you.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.600
Yeah, but, Dushane, warning shot or not,
like, you know how this goes.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.800
We have to reply to that.

03:22.480 --> 03:25.240
Yeah, but we have to make
the right reply, though, bruv.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.800
It's all there.
Less the ten that you took.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.440
[knocking]

03:59.600 --> 04:00.760
[Haze] Twenty kilos.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.520
Did you or did you not
promise Sugar serious money?

04:05.040 --> 04:06.920
'Cause Sugar ain't interested
in small-time shit.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.640
Bruv, Sugar needs to realise
that we're just getting started.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.080
Sugar understands that.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.400
That's why he's being generous

04:12.480 --> 04:15.200
and giving you till the end of the month
to come back with the money.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.880
Talking 'bout till the end of the month.
We need longer than that.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.040
You told Sugar you could sell
all over London.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.760
So take your food and go sell.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.080
[Dushane tsks]

04:29.400 --> 04:30.560
Fuck it, man.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.760
Bruv, you know what that means now, innit?

04:41.040 --> 04:44.240
That whole Jamie problem?
Like, we have to deal with it.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.480
[Dushane sighs]

04:46.560 --> 04:47.560
[car engine starts]

04:50.280 --> 04:51.960
Bent. Keep your knees bent. All right?

04:52.040 --> 04:53.320
- [man] Okay.
- Come on, then.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.040
Bent, man! Move!

04:57.360 --> 04:58.720
[Jaq] What you doing?

04:58.800 --> 05:00.120
Hold on. Wait a minute.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.240
- You know what bent means, right?
- Yes, I know.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.640
- Well, it ain't rigid like that, is it?
- Okay.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.560
Come on. That's it.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.560
And again.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.440
And again. That's it!

05:11.520 --> 05:13.200
Nice! Now, that's what I'm talkin' about.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.840
Send his nose to the back of his head.
Come on.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.480
- [woman] Comin' in tomorrow, then?
- More than likely.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.480
- You know what I'm like.
- [woman laughs]

05:20.560 --> 05:22.480
- You love it here, innit?
- Yeah.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.720
[mobile phone vibrates]

05:36.000 --> 05:38.160
[female voice] Hey, hurry up.
Your tea's gettin' cold.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.160
[chuckles]

05:46.480 --> 05:48.720
Time and tide, ladies. Time and tide.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.400
- [man] See ya in a bit, Jaq.
- In a bit.

05:50.720 --> 05:51.840
So how was training?

05:52.360 --> 05:53.360
Good, yeah.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.840
Maybe I should start goin'.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.680
Maybe you should.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.200
Are you sayin' I'm fat?

05:59.280 --> 06:01.480
[chuckles] That's what you get
when you go fishin', innit?

06:01.560 --> 06:02.400
[woman] Oh.

06:02.880 --> 06:03.920
What you got on today?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.640
This young director's comin' in
for the ad.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.320
What ad? The razor one?

06:07.400 --> 06:09.600
Yeah. What about you? What you got on?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.200
I'm gonna have to do
a bit of recruiting still.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.920
Some of the youngers got hit last night.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.760
What? The fuckin' acid attack?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.600
- Yeah.
- Shit.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.920
- That poor kid.
- Yeah, he's fucked still.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.440
Acid's fuckin' low, man.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.840
But will he be all right, the kid?

06:25.520 --> 06:26.600
Fuck knows.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.400
Hey, look...

06:28.480 --> 06:30.880
Nah, man. I beg you. Not this shit again.
Don't say it, man.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.800
I know people who...

06:32.880 --> 06:34.760
- Who want what you're selling, right?
- [Jaq tsks]

06:34.840 --> 06:38.120
And, no, they're not the kind of people
who throw acid in your face.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.320
I already told you.
I don't want you involved in this.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.640
I'll just introduce you.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.800
You introducing me,
that gets you involved.

06:46.520 --> 06:47.840
I'm just trying to help.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.040
You help, all right?

06:53.720 --> 06:56.560
When I'm out there working all day,
who do you think I'm thinkin' of?

06:58.520 --> 06:59.560
[mobile phone vibrates]

06:59.840 --> 07:00.680
[chuckles]

07:01.320 --> 07:02.600
Hey, listen, I gotta go.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.000
I'll see you tonight, yeah?

07:05.720 --> 07:06.960
I might have to work.

07:08.600 --> 07:12.200
Dris is a fuckin' liability right now.
I'm basically doing two jobs.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.200
[sharp exhale]

07:15.280 --> 07:17.880
See? You got me talkin' about work
when all I wanna do is talk about

07:17.960 --> 07:19.600
what we're gonna do when we're together.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.080
[chuckles]

07:24.240 --> 07:25.760
Hey, you be careful. Yeah?

07:26.080 --> 07:28.200
- And stay out of trouble.
- Why?

07:28.280 --> 07:29.720
- Why?
- What? Do you care?

07:29.800 --> 07:31.080
Yeah. No. [chuckles]

07:31.160 --> 07:33.240
- Yeah? No? No?
- I didn't say that, did I? No?

07:33.320 --> 07:35.280
- No, I don't care. Fuck off.
- Come here, dickhead.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.280
[both laughing]

07:37.400 --> 07:38.480
In a bit.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.800
[indistinct chatter]

07:55.720 --> 07:57.320
[Dris] Yo, let me chat to this yout, fam.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.480
[Dushane] Wah gwaan.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.920
Wah gwaan.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.560
Safe.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.000
Listen, man just got
a whole load of food, fam.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.360
Twenty boxes.
Need to sell it by the end of the month.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.600
Bruv, we ain't gonna move 20 boxes
on the road by the end of the month.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.560
Why not?

08:14.840 --> 08:16.320
Not with Jamie on the scene.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.840
Pssh. Bruv, shot it to other gangs
or something.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.280
I don't give a fuck, bro.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.320
Bro, they're not gonna cop that shit.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.480
Bro, I need results, fam.

08:25.720 --> 08:29.320
All these gangs, yeah,
they're taking this ZT shit serious, fam.

08:29.400 --> 08:30.240
ZTs.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.559
They ain't gonna cop nothing
that's not coming from Jamie.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.320
Wah gwaan.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.799
- What?
- [Jaq] What kind of attitude is that, man?

08:39.600 --> 08:40.520
[Dushane] How's Romy?

08:40.960 --> 08:42.200
He's all right.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.919
Knife didn't hit no vital organ
or nothing,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.560
so he should be out of hospital
in three or four days.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.240
Yeah, well, tell him make it three.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.240
We need everyone out there
on the road right now.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.160
Yeah, I know.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.920
Less than half my youngers turned up
to work after this acid ting.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.320
And you know they're makin' up excuses
so they ain't got a pattern on the corner.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.720
- So what am I supposed to do with them?
- Get more youngers. Get 'em shottin'.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.960
- And find 'em where, bruv?
- I don't know. I don't care.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.600
- [Dushane] Oh.
- That's your fuckin' problem.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.520
- Ay, man! Yo!
- What the fuck is this petty shit?

09:06.600 --> 09:07.960
What are you doing? Huh?

09:09.360 --> 09:11.520
Listen, both of you two
need to drop the fuckin' attitude

09:11.600 --> 09:13.960
and start delivering results.
I don't fuckin' care, man.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.720
Seriously.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.800
Go to the block, get Kieron.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.160
Tell them youngers to come out
their fuckin' house, man.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.840
- [Dushane] Put that in their hand.
- All right, cool.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.920
- In a bit.
- [Dushane] Yeah.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.600
She's starting to become
a fuckin' pain, bruv.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.400
Starting to like her already.

09:35.520 --> 09:36.520
Hey, you man, I'm gone.

09:36.880 --> 09:37.840
Where you goin'?

09:38.040 --> 09:39.960
It's Jason's cremation today, innit?

09:41.280 --> 09:42.480
Do you want me to come?

09:43.240 --> 09:44.440
Nah. [sniffles]

09:44.520 --> 09:46.280
I'm good. Ain't no big deal.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.320
What you saying? You eaten?

09:58.840 --> 09:59.680
Nah.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.760
Come and grab some food.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.400
How's the little one doin'?

10:05.560 --> 10:08.000
She's good, man.
Top of her class in art, innit?

10:08.760 --> 10:09.760
That's good.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.960
You need to be there for her, you know.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.480
What?

10:14.880 --> 10:17.600
Dads.
To be there for their daughters, man.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.960
What do you know about that, man?
You ain't got no kids.

10:21.480 --> 10:22.840
I've been there for her.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.360
All these years. Did it all myself.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.240
Yeah, well, things are changing now,
you know.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.680
They're about to get heavy.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.560
You know, if I can't take the heat
out of this Jamie situation,

10:36.640 --> 10:38.480
they're only gonna get heavier, innit?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.000
Bruv, why you telling me this?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.280
This ain't nothing
we ain't been through before.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.280
I need someone I can rely on, Dris.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.280
What?

10:48.480 --> 10:50.040
Bro, you've been slipping, fam.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.360
Since I got back, you've been slipping.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.360
Bro, the fits, the medication.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.160
- All the other fuckin' drugs...
- Bruv, listen!

10:59.240 --> 11:00.480
Keep your voice down, fam.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.320
You snatched up Jamie's girlfriend
off the street

11:05.400 --> 11:07.000
like a fuckin' amateur the other day.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.120
You know how much that cost us?

11:10.600 --> 11:13.160
You're making too much mistakes, fam.
I ain't got room for it.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.200
You're gonna have to step back.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.120
What the fuck does that mean? Step back?

11:17.360 --> 11:19.600
- You keep on running the corners.
- That's Jaq's job.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.480
Nah, it ain't Jaq's job.
It's your job now.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.160
- What?
- Jaq's stepping up till you're back.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.360
Look, fam, it's not for long.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.680
Jaq's gonna find some more shottas,
you make sure they keep shottin'.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.600
You get me?

11:42.080 --> 11:43.080
Dris?

11:45.560 --> 11:46.960
Get yourself clean, bruv.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.520
You'll be back before you know it.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.600
[Jamie] All I'm saying is, the man sitting
across me from the table last night,

12:04.080 --> 12:06.440
he ain't nothing like the old Dushane
what I've heard of.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.440
I mean, he's done out here.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.600
And the thing is, I think he knows it.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.520
Trust me, he don't want no smoke.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.440
And hitting them Summerhouse
young Gs last night as well.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.240
Now he knows this ain't no game.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.120
Yo, you think Dushane's gonna
care about some YGs on the roads?

12:23.960 --> 12:26.160
[Leyton] You had him next to you, bruv.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.360
You coulda killed him there and then.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.600
But you fucked it.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.960
I say we kill Dushane, you know.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.280
Lay that fucker out once and for all.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.040
Kill him right now.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.880
And kill Sully and all.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.120
Bruv, that's the wrong move.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.080
[Jamie] We ain't got to go after
Dushane and Sully.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.680
We go after the youngers.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.920
See, last night,
I put the ball in Dushane's court.

12:51.320 --> 12:55.880
If I don't like how he responds,
then him and Sully can go.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.720
Just like what we done to Cam
and the Turks.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.240
But not until you hear from me.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.800
[train passes by]

13:14.880 --> 13:16.880
[hip hop plays on car stereo]

13:28.720 --> 13:29.720
[music stops]

13:39.240 --> 13:40.360
Acid attacks?

13:41.280 --> 13:42.760
I'm just goin' down your path.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.960
My path?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.160
Yeah, keepin' it low-key like you want.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.760
With acid attacks?

13:48.680 --> 13:51.120
Listen, Lizzie, I got two choices.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.320
I go after Dushane and Sully direct.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.600
And that ain't gonna be easy,

13:54.680 --> 13:57.600
'cause they gonna be in Summerhouse
and they gonna have their guard up.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.200
I'm gonna need a lot of man
and a lot of guns.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.320
That's gonna make a lot of noise.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.560
Feds'll be swarming the place,
and it ain't good for none of us.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.640
Second choice I got,
I scare his shotters off the roads.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.360
Dushane can't sell shit.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.920
He won't be able to pay his supplier,
he's fucked.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.960
And that's without a shot being fired.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.520
So you've got everything under control?

14:19.080 --> 14:19.920
Yeah.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.400
I do.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.800
And I promise you,
nothing bad's gonna happen to you.

14:23.880 --> 14:27.680
None of that shit that happened with Dris.
I personally guarantee it.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.200
That was my fuck-up.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.120
Unprofessional.

14:33.840 --> 14:34.840
I told you.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.120
That was a one-time thing.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.920
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it happened.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.040
But it's not happening again.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.120
How old were you when she died?

14:56.240 --> 14:57.360
Your mum?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.760
She died young, didn't she?

15:03.120 --> 15:04.320
How'd you know that?

15:05.160 --> 15:07.800
- How old were you?
- I said, how do you know that?

15:08.320 --> 15:09.560
What age were you?

15:11.360 --> 15:12.880
[Jamie sighs]

15:14.040 --> 15:15.080
Eighteen.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.600
Who told you that she died?

15:19.800 --> 15:21.320
I'm Irish. [chuckles]

15:22.600 --> 15:25.080
If there's one thing we know about,
it's families.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.200
Your dad wasn't around either, was he?

15:29.520 --> 15:30.920
My dad was around.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.040
He was around right to the end.

15:36.760 --> 15:37.760
So, what?

15:38.640 --> 15:40.200
He left you when your mum died?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.720
Went off with another woman?

15:44.080 --> 15:45.200
[Jamie chuckles softly]

15:45.600 --> 15:47.440
You don't know nothing about my dad.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.440
Look...

15:52.280 --> 15:53.280
I'm married.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.520
I'm older.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.600
I don't know what it is
you're looking for,

15:58.680 --> 16:00.360
but you're not gonna find it with me.

16:00.440 --> 16:01.280
Okay?

16:03.240 --> 16:05.360
I just want you to be clear about that.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.840
Now, let's just focus
on the issue at hand.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.760
Dushane. Summerhouse.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.800
Like I said, I got it under control.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.280
I hope so.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.160
[distant police siren wailing]

16:51.360 --> 16:52.640
- Yeah?
- Tell me.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.680
Well, I'll pattern some youngers
up here, innit?

16:54.760 --> 16:56.800
Aight, cool.
So I'm gonna circulate, innit?

16:56.880 --> 16:58.120
Say no more.

16:58.440 --> 17:01.160
I know you need Ps
to retwist your dreads, yeah.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.720
So man's gonna nice you right now, yeah?

17:03.800 --> 17:04.960
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

17:05.040 --> 17:05.880
- Sixteen?
- Yeah.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.079
- You going to college?
- Yeah.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.680
You know you wanna hold it. Hold it, fam.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.720
Nah, it's too dangerous.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.359
What do you mean it's dangerous, bro?

17:25.440 --> 17:27.160
You can come out of
that friendzone, my guy,

17:27.240 --> 17:28.840
- if you make some Ps...
- Bro.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.920
- She will let you chop.
- No. No, man.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.080
- I guarantee you get the crutches.
- That was a bit far.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.320
Hey, princess, come.
At least chat to me, bruv.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.880
[sighs]

17:45.600 --> 17:47.760
How you done just fuck up
the pattern like that?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.480
I was trying to help him out, innit?
I'm trying to teach him something.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.520
Nah, bro, you was teaching him
how to be a fuckboy and a wasteman.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.120
I already had tings lined up.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.120
Do you know what, fam?
Do your ting from down here.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.360
- I'm floating. In a bit.
- Hey, Jaq, man, I'm joking.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.520
Bro, go and make your money,

18:01.600 --> 18:03.960
get your reload
and find me some youngers.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.160
[Lauryn] Come on, then. Spill.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.320
[tsks] What the fuck, girl?
We need some give-and-take here, you know.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.760
Look, if you want me to babysit Tish again
then you have to give me somethin'.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.360
What? I thought you loved
spending time with Tish.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.320
I do. That girl's my little diva, man.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.600
But, look, I am entitled to some gossip,
you know.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.200
There ain't no gossip, Lauryn.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.920
His mum was in a hospital bed
literally three feet away.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.560
I mean, we talked, but...

18:30.320 --> 18:32.640
Actually, I talked.
He wasn't saying too much, to be honest.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.920
Do you actually like him?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.800
I mean, he's a good-looking man.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.240
And he's a man, you know, not a boy.

18:47.440 --> 18:48.600
He's kind.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.360
- Kind?
- Yeah.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.920
Kind? What the fuck is kind?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.360
- Kind is good. Trust me.
- [Lauryn laughs]

18:57.520 --> 18:59.560
So, what? You gonna let him
take you out then?

19:11.920 --> 19:13.800
[tsks] This girl, man.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.480
What about the other ones?

19:15.560 --> 19:17.680
- [Lauryn] Dushane's friend?
- Sully.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
[tsks]

19:20.160 --> 19:22.440
I think me and him would look
quite good together, you know.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.440
[laughs]

19:23.520 --> 19:25.520
- Fuck off.
- What? He's fit!

19:26.080 --> 19:28.640
Hey, you've got his number, haven't you?
Call him on his phone.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.960
Tell him there's two beautiful ladies here
waiting for him.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.720
Sully ain't gonna wanna have nothing
with you.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.040
You're like a fuckin' drag queen.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.320
The fuck do you know about stylin', bitch?

19:36.400 --> 19:39.440
Enough to know that I don't need it.
Man's got natural beauty, innit?

19:39.520 --> 19:41.400
Is that what your new girlfriend's
been telling you?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.640
[Lauryn chuckles]
Needs her fuckin' eyes tested.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.200
- Fuck you, man.
- Wait. What?

19:46.280 --> 19:47.560
Are you seeing someone, Jaq?

19:48.880 --> 19:49.960
Ain't nothin' special.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.880
Bullshit!
You're over there every fuckin' night!

19:51.960 --> 19:53.080
Shut up, man.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.680
That's exciting. What's her name?

20:00.240 --> 20:02.560
Shelley asked you a question, fam.
Don't be so fuckin' rude.

20:03.680 --> 20:06.280
What's she called, then,
this dyke with a golden pussy?

20:06.360 --> 20:07.560
Shut the fuck up, man!

20:07.640 --> 20:09.320
- [Lauryn laughs]
- Come on, what's her name?

20:10.240 --> 20:11.160
[sighs]

20:11.920 --> 20:12.760
Maude.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.560
What? Maude?

20:15.480 --> 20:16.440
Maude?

20:16.520 --> 20:19.440
What kind of crusty old fuckin' name
is Maude?

20:19.520 --> 20:21.240
[Lauryn] What? How old is she? Eighty?

20:21.320 --> 20:22.440
Shut the fuck up, man!

20:22.520 --> 20:23.960
[laughs]

20:24.040 --> 20:25.960
- No wonder she's fuckin' blind.
- Allow it.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.920
She got cobwebs
in her old lady bush and all?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
- [Jaq] Allow it, man!
- [Lauryn] Nah!

20:30.400 --> 20:32.600
Man. Oh, my days.

20:32.680 --> 20:33.760
Hey, who you texting?

20:33.840 --> 20:36.240
Everyone. Her name's fuckin' Maude.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.560
- Nah, man!
- Get off my hair, man!

20:38.640 --> 20:40.000
Get off my hair!

20:40.080 --> 20:43.440
- You're a wasteman. Get out of...
- Yeah, you're a wasteman! [laughs]

20:43.520 --> 20:44.600
Go check Maude!

20:45.480 --> 20:47.840
[Lauryn] Unbelievable!
Where'd you meet her?

20:47.920 --> 20:49.720
Where do you find these people like Maude?

20:56.760 --> 20:59.200
["Work All Day" by Barry Biggs
playing on radio]

21:03.400 --> 21:05.320
Hey, my boy!

21:06.920 --> 21:08.400
You gonna bake today?

21:08.680 --> 21:11.280
I thought we could do it together,
like we used to.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.280
[Amma laughs]

21:14.440 --> 21:15.360
Come on.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.280
Okay, what do you have to do first?

21:23.360 --> 21:24.960
- Wash my hands?
- Go for it.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.320

21:29.400 --> 21:30.920
[Amma] Hmm. Guess.

- How did you afford all this stuff?
- Keep going.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.040
[Amma] Ah, I saved up a little.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.520
Good boy. Put that in.

- Scoop.
- Good boy.

you know. This is all mad.

doesn't make any sense.

What are you talking about?

If you know where Sully's gonna be,
you take your fuckin' chance.

Now you gotta step up for your boy.

Hmm?

23:35.760 --> 23:36.720
Yeah.

23:37.640 --> 23:38.680
You ready?

I need a picture printed out,
but it's on my phone.

24:07.960 --> 24:08.960
Sure. What size?

24:10.320 --> 24:12.520
I don't know, but this is the picture.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.960
I just want it as clear as possible.

Sure. All right.

What are you doing?

24:20.840 --> 24:22.520
I need to go and check
the picture quality.

- Yeah, it won't be long.

All right.

What is it?

24:59.640 --> 25:00.760
[sighs]

25:01.560 --> 25:02.600
We have to leave.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.160
Leave what?

25:05.200 --> 25:06.720
Here. The flat.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.360
Why do we have to leave?

25:11.720 --> 25:12.760
I'm sorry.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.760
But why? Why do we have to leave?

25:18.480 --> 25:22.120
We're being evicted
because I can't pay the rent.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.560
[Ats hits table] Don't wanna move.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.160
I know, I don't either.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.840
What's gonna happen to us?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.480
It's going to be all right.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.000
You don't have to worry.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.360

26:40.640 --> 26:42.680

What's wrong with you?

26:53.440 --> 26:55.880

Look at me. I'm being fuckin' serious.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.040
Shit might get heavy. Keep your head down.

27:07.120 --> 27:10.400
Go to Auntie Bernadette's

27:10.880 --> 27:12.560

'Thinking of you'?

27:29.960 --> 27:30.840
You all right, Mum?

27:31.120 --> 27:32.000
Yeah.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.640
[Dushane grunts]

27:34.200 --> 27:35.560
[Pat chuckles]

27:36.080 --> 27:38.040
My two boys together.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.960
I shoulda come in to hospital years ago.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.160
[Charlie chuckles]

27:42.240 --> 27:45.040
- How you feeling?
- Fine, fine.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.040
[Pat] I keep telling them that
ever since I came in.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.280
I already told you, Mum.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.200
You should not be living in that flat
all on your own.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.840
So where else am I supposed to live?

27:56.680 --> 27:58.760
I'm fine where I am, thank you.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.360
Listen, um, I'm gonna go

28:03.440 --> 28:04.920
- Back in a minute.
- Okay.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.080
[Charlie] You know what?
I'm gonna make a move.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.160
Listen, you call me
when you're home, all right?

28:10.240 --> 28:11.560
- [Pat] Okay.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.920
- [Pat] You take care, all right?
- [Charlie] I will.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.760
What you doing here?

28:22.520 --> 28:23.880
Come to see Mum, innit?

28:24.200 --> 28:27.360
'Come to see Mum.' What?
Are you playing the best son now, yeah?

28:28.440 --> 28:30.880
- You're a fool, you know that?
- You're a fuckin' fool, bruv.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.120
Listen...

28:35.920 --> 28:38.080
did you tell anyone
I come to see you about that money?

28:38.160 --> 28:39.040
[tsks]

28:39.120 --> 28:40.760
- Yo.
- Hey, mind yourself, you know.

28:40.840 --> 28:42.920
I'll mind myself. Did you tell anyone?

28:43.560 --> 28:47.080
I don't know what you're talking about.
Furthermore, who am I gonna tell? Huh?

28:47.440 --> 28:49.360
- So you didn't tell no one?
- No.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.520
What's happening, then? Talk to me.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.200
[sighs, tsks]

29:09.680 --> 29:12.120
[Pat] I don't...
I just want to get out of here.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.000
[Pat] Hi.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.760
So, they're gonna keep you in
one more night.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.120
[Pat groans]

29:18.440 --> 29:19.560
I know, I know.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.440
But you'll be home tomorrow.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.280
[Pat] Well, they've said that before.

29:24.520 --> 29:25.520
[Pat groans]

29:32.400 --> 29:34.520
[Pat] What's going on between you two?

29:34.600 --> 29:35.640
[chuckles]

29:35.960 --> 29:37.280
You're too nosy, you know.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.960
Listen to me, Dushane Hill.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.960
[Pat] This is a good girl.

29:42.480 --> 29:46.120
You'd better treat her right,
or you'll have me to deal with, all right?

29:46.200 --> 29:47.520
I know. Okay.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.320
Now, off you go, both of you.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.840
I need my beauty sleep.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.040
All right. Rest up.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.480
I'll see you later.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.680
[Dushane] So, I'm sorry about my mum.

30:06.920 --> 30:07.760
[scoffs]

30:07.840 --> 30:09.480
She feels like
she needs to know everything

30:09.560 --> 30:11.520
that's going on in my life, man.
[chuckles]

30:12.360 --> 30:13.240
Can't blame her.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.640
She told me she never met
a single girlfriend of yours.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.880
It hasn't been that many, to be fair.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.880
- Oh, yeah?
- What do you mean, 'Oh, yeah?'

30:21.960 --> 30:23.200
There hasn't. I'm being serious.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.520
Mmm. [chuckles]

30:25.720 --> 30:26.560
[tsks]

30:29.760 --> 30:30.960
What about Tish's dad?

30:32.360 --> 30:34.480
- Where is he?
- One guess.

30:36.360 --> 30:37.400
How long?

30:38.400 --> 30:39.640
Twenty-seven years.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.640
[sharp exhale]

30:41.520 --> 30:43.000
That's a lot of years, man.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.920
He was my first boyfriend.

30:48.080 --> 30:52.320
Shoulda got out a lot sooner than I did,
but I just didn't know any better.

30:53.320 --> 30:54.280
[chuckles]

30:55.800 --> 30:57.280
Do you take Tish to see him in there?

30:57.680 --> 30:59.360
He ain't interested. Never was.

31:00.840 --> 31:01.880
Yeah, I hear that.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.960
Erm, my dad lives local, innit?

31:06.920 --> 31:08.640
But he's on his own ting, so...

31:12.960 --> 31:13.880
You know what?

31:14.320 --> 31:15.920
Tish ain't missing out on nothin'.

31:16.000 --> 31:16.840
[chuckles]

31:17.160 --> 31:19.720
And if he's not interested,
then that's his loss, innit?

31:20.120 --> 31:21.520
She's a beautiful girl, man.

31:23.240 --> 31:24.480
Gets it from her mum.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.520
[Stefan] Ats. Your mum's gonna go nuts.

31:37.880 --> 31:38.800
Don't do it!

31:39.600 --> 31:42.440
You got your yard, man,
where your bed is and all your things.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.400
I don't have that. Not no more.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.160
Don't tell me what I can do
and what I can't do.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.960
You don't really mean that, do you?

31:50.800 --> 31:52.000
I do mean it.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
I do.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.520
You don't know what it's like, man.
You got no idea.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.360
If you wanna help me, can you fuck off?

31:59.440 --> 32:02.200
[police siren wailing]

32:10.160 --> 32:11.680
I wanna sell for you, bruv.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.360
I'd be good at it, innit?

32:14.720 --> 32:15.840
Listen, little man.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.040
This ain't for you. Trust me.

32:19.040 --> 32:19.920
[Ats] It is.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.320
[scoffs]

32:21.400 --> 32:22.920
You ain't tough enough for the road.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.080
I am tough.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.000
- Go home, man.
- Nah, I wanna sell.

32:27.080 --> 32:28.240
Go home.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.840
No, I wanna sell.

32:29.920 --> 32:33.040
[Kieron] Ats, fucking go home
before I tell your mum.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.400
- [Jaq] Ay, what? He wants to shot?
- [Kieron] Nah, he don't.

32:35.480 --> 32:36.560
Yeah, I do!

32:38.360 --> 32:39.360
[Jaq] Ats, right?

32:40.800 --> 32:41.760
Come here, little man.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.880
Hey, Kieron, come here, man.

33:03.800 --> 33:04.640
[Jaq] Wah gwaan.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.040
Ain't that your bredren?

33:08.680 --> 33:10.480
[Ats] Sort of. Not anymore.

33:10.560 --> 33:13.120
So, what? You two lovebirds
had a falling out or something, yeah?

33:13.200 --> 33:14.560
He ain't my friend anymore.

33:15.080 --> 33:15.920
What's his name?

33:16.000 --> 33:16.960
[Ats] Stefan.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.680
What's his last name?

33:19.360 --> 33:20.280
[Ats] Tovell.

33:21.320 --> 33:22.160
Aight.

33:24.120 --> 33:26.840
All right, but I need to know that you
know what you gotta do to earn your Ps.

33:27.280 --> 33:28.120
I know.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.960
That means you're gonna have to go out
and you're gonna have to shot hard food.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.240
And you always gotta bring back
the right amount of money.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.600
Or one of the mandem's gonna give you
a bag to put in your yard

33:35.680 --> 33:38.160
and you're gonna have to hold onto it,
and you ain't allowed to look inside.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.720
You're gonna have to keep it safe until
mandem come to get it. You feel me?

33:42.800 --> 33:43.680
Yeah.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.720
Aight, cool. Listen, what's your number?

33:49.120 --> 33:50.880

33:50.960 --> 33:54.040
Shit. Well, no wonder you wanna

34:21.400 --> 34:22.320
[door shuts]

34:35.159 --> 34:36.960
I can say something if you'd like.

34:42.040 --> 34:42.960
You didn't know him.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.440
[Sully sighs]

34:55.120 --> 34:56.120
You all right?

35:02.920 --> 35:03.880
I think so.

35:16.600 --> 35:17.920
Do you want me do it?

35:19.240 --> 35:21.240
Do you want me to put the photo on top?

35:29.120 --> 35:30.000
I...

35:31.440 --> 35:32.400
I could...

35:34.880 --> 35:37.400
[sniffles] I'm fuckin' embarrassed.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.480
Sorry.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.120
No, don't be.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.440
He was just a young kid, you know?

36:00.960 --> 36:02.000
[sniffles]

36:05.480 --> 36:06.520
I can do it.

It's who he is, innit?
It's Jamie's little brother's bredren.

Go out and pattern it.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.280
Bruv, I told you no.

43:28.680 --> 43:31.160
I fuckin' told you,
and I gave you a direct fuckin' order!

43:31.240 --> 43:33.200
A direct order?

43:33.280 --> 43:35.200

What? Am I some pussyhole?

43:40.160 --> 43:41.280
Am I a pussy?

43:42.160 --> 43:44.920
What? So it's a fucking waste
to take a shot at Sully?

43:45.000 --> 43:48.800
Bruv, you took your shot
and you fuckin' missed.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.360
That's the whole point.
You fuckin' missed!

43:51.440 --> 43:53.920
So now Dushane and Sully

43:54.000 --> 43:56.520
So tell me now, how the fuck

43:57.840 --> 44:00.560
- Bruv, Modie told me...

44:00.880 --> 44:03.480
Modie's in jail

Nah, listen.

45:36.360 --> 45:39.040
We can't start a full-blown war now, bruv.
It's gonna be chaos.

Huh?

45:55.160 --> 45:56.280
