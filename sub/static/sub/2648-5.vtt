- You're not getting a car.
- But I won.

19:40.260 --> 19:41.885
Yes, but we never thought you would.
Mm-hmm.

19:42.011 --> 19:43.430
So? [ Claire ] So-

19:43.512 --> 19:45.390
Congratulations on your victory.

19:45.515 --> 19:47.807
Nobody can ever take that
away from you. So true.

19:47.891 --> 19:52.687
But I spent two days in my room,
talking to a bar of soap.

19:52.769 --> 19:55.023
- It's not fair.
- It's totally not fair.

19:55.148 --> 19:57.233
We're outraged.
Bad parenting.

19:57.316 --> 19:59.525
- [ Doorbell Rings]
- But we had a deal.

19:59.610 --> 20:02.278
Which, in hindsight,
was utter nonsense.

20:02.361 --> 20:04.323
[ Door Opens ]
Hey.

20:04.448 --> 20:06.782
We hated Billingsley.
The place is so stupid.

20:06.866 --> 20:09.034
You blew the interview,
didn't you?

20:09.118 --> 20:11.410
[Whimpering ]
Lesbians.

20:11.535 --> 20:13.538
In a wheelchair.
Oh.

20:18.666 --> 20:20.668
You still mad at me?
You tell me.

20:22.087 --> 20:23.588
What is this?
I've been thinking.

20:23.671 --> 20:25.757
If you said as much about America
as I said about Colombia...

20:25.839 --> 20:27.133
I'd be plenty ticked off.

20:27.215 --> 20:28.675
Doesn't make up
for everything, but-

20:28.760 --> 20:30.594
A trip to Colombia?

20:30.676 --> 20:32.220
I wanna see your village,
learn your culture.

20:32.303 --> 20:35.513
I love you. I'm sure I'm gonna love
where you come from.

20:35.597 --> 20:37.849
Ay Jay. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

20:37.932 --> 20:39.684
[ Laughing]

20:40.560 --> 20:42.519
No way he's going
to my village.

20:42.604 --> 20:45.649
I was in two car accidents
when I was living there.

20:45.731 --> 20:48.651
Both times, I hit a goat.
One was hurt pretty bad.

20:48.734 --> 20:51.362
But it was a good thing
I had a shovel in the trunk.

20:55.948 --> 20:57.866
[Affected Accent]
The tribe elders foretold...

20:57.949 --> 21:01.244
that though I lay
with fire-haired man,

21:01.328 --> 21:05.582
the giving hawk
would bring us baby,

21:05.666 --> 21:09.834
with her skin
the color of sweet corn,

21:09.918 --> 21:13.213
which my people call maize.

21:13.295 --> 21:14.464
Okay. Please stop.

21:14.546 --> 21:16.256
Well, uh-

21:16.340 --> 21:19.342
Knowledge is her sustenance.

21:19.425 --> 21:21.678
Like so much maize,

21:21.762 --> 21:26.098
which, you'll remember,
means corn.

21:26.182 --> 21:27.934
What if I was
a single dad?

21:34.940 --> 21:35.941
