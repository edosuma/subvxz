00:00.004 --> 00:01.609
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on "Devious Maids"...</i>

00:01.738 --> 00:04.585
Are you having fun watching your
book get made into a movie?

00:04.620 --> 00:06.226
It's not what I expected.

00:06.261 --> 00:07.986
Let me introduce you
to the gang.

00:08.021 --> 00:10.489
Hugh Metzger, I'm obsessed
with your films.

00:10.531 --> 00:12.411
The truth is I didn't
want to get your hopes up.

00:12.433 --> 00:13.493
- About what?
- About your movie

00:13.495 --> 00:15.343
- being back in production.
- I thought it was dead.

00:15.345 --> 00:17.035
Now it's not.
Hugh Metzger wants to direct.

00:17.070 --> 00:18.903
We want you to write it.

00:18.939 --> 00:20.672
Oh, you're the reverend?
Hello.

00:20.708 --> 00:23.007
You seem so...
happy serving others.

00:23.043 --> 00:24.810
Would you like to have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

00:24.845 --> 00:26.177
Zoila, this is my mother.

00:26.213 --> 00:28.380
I like her, too.
But not for you.

00:28.415 --> 00:30.248
I have other plans
for you, Kyle.

00:30.283 --> 00:32.150
I find you intriguing.

00:32.185 --> 00:34.052
You only asked me out
to make Evelyn jealous.

00:34.087 --> 00:35.586
It seems we have
a lot in common.

00:36.890 --> 00:38.389
<i>I never should have
broken up with you.</i>

00:38.424 --> 00:40.658
Give me another chance,
and I will make it up to you.

00:40.693 --> 00:42.693
One thing.
Let's not tell my mother.

00:42.729 --> 00:44.028
Deal.

00:44.064 --> 00:45.730
I brought you a latte...
on the house.

00:45.765 --> 00:47.665
That barista's
got a serious crush on you.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.000
And every time I lead him on,
I get a free coffee.

00:50.035 --> 00:51.201
I know you're my mother now.

00:51.237 --> 00:52.403
Nothing's changed.

00:52.438 --> 00:53.871
You don't want to be my mother?

00:53.906 --> 00:55.840
I'm sorry, Danni,
but I can't be that for you.

00:55.875 --> 00:57.196
Ready to go to the airport?

00:57.209 --> 00:58.743
Just telling my mom
I'm coming home.

00:58.778 --> 01:01.278
Who's that?
Fabian, my hairdresser.

01:01.313 --> 01:03.381
You should read this.
I tried to read it.

01:03.416 --> 01:05.081
- I found it kind of boring.
- You know what?

01:05.117 --> 01:07.517
There's a reason
you didn't understand it.

01:07.552 --> 01:09.586
The ideas in that
book are new...

01:09.621 --> 01:10.787
and you're old.

01:10.822 --> 01:12.589
There's this bad man named Ben.

01:12.624 --> 01:13.625
He's involved
with something

01:13.627 --> 01:14.591
- called The Circle.
- Hold on.

01:14.626 --> 01:17.460
Fabian was always trying
to get me to read this.

01:17.496 --> 01:19.096
It sounds like a cult.

01:19.131 --> 01:20.797
We weren't sure you
could be trusted anymore.

01:20.832 --> 01:23.032
W-W-We?
Mother knows about this?

01:23.067 --> 01:25.375
She's very unhappy with you.

01:26.137 --> 01:28.037
And you know how Mother gets.

01:29.007 --> 01:30.473
Mm.

01:30.609 --> 01:32.442
Mm.

01:32.477 --> 01:35.244
These sheets are heaven.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.048
It's nice staying
at your place...

01:39.083 --> 01:40.549
for a change.

01:40.584 --> 01:42.618
Well, don't get used to it.

01:42.653 --> 01:44.620
My mother comes home
from her trip today.

01:46.757 --> 01:48.257
Kyle...

01:50.995 --> 01:53.329
why are we still keeping this
from her?

01:53.364 --> 01:56.732
Because keeping a secret
is sexy.

01:56.767 --> 01:58.400
Don't you think?

01:58.436 --> 02:00.602
I just hate lying to her.

02:00.638 --> 02:02.137
She's my friend,

02:02.172 --> 02:05.607
and I think she'd be
really happy for us.

02:05.643 --> 02:08.509
Yeah, but I don't want
to share you.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.067
Not yet.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.682
<i>Kyle? I'm home.</i>

02:14.717 --> 02:16.418
- Ohh!
- She's back early.

02:16.453 --> 02:17.785
Hide.

02:17.821 --> 02:19.254
Hide?

02:19.289 --> 02:21.423
We will tell her eventually,
but not like this.

02:21.458 --> 02:22.690
Why don't you just
lock the door?

02:22.725 --> 02:23.885
'Cause I never lock the door.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.927
- She'll know something's up.
- <i>You still asleep?</i>

02:25.963 --> 02:28.529
Fine.
Where's the closet?

02:28.565 --> 02:30.531
I don't have a closet.
I have an armoire.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.667
Here.
Go out the window.

02:32.702 --> 02:35.269
Are you kidding?
We're on the second floor.

02:35.304 --> 02:36.938
There's a ledge.

02:36.973 --> 02:38.138
Just go out there for a minute,
and I'll get rid of her.

02:38.174 --> 02:39.507
Come on. Go.

02:39.542 --> 02:41.175
- <i>Kyle, honey.</i>
- Kyle. Kyle.

02:41.210 --> 02:43.277
- Kyle.
- Quick, go, go, go!

02:43.312 --> 02:45.212
This is crazy.

02:45.247 --> 02:46.981
Aah!
It's not that high.

02:51.153 --> 02:52.953
Mother. Hey.

02:52.989 --> 02:54.321
Welcome home.

02:54.357 --> 02:55.856
We need to talk about Ben.

02:55.891 --> 02:57.691
Tell me
everything that happened.

02:57.726 --> 02:59.126
Yeah. Absolutely.

02:59.161 --> 03:01.628
But first, tell me...
how was your trip?

03:02.831 --> 03:04.364
How was that?

03:04.399 --> 03:06.399
Fine. Why?

03:07.769 --> 03:09.002
What's wrong?

03:09.037 --> 03:10.670
I got to put some clothes on.

03:10.706 --> 03:12.238
I'll be downstairs in a sec.

03:12.273 --> 03:13.507
Okay. All right.
Okay.

03:17.178 --> 03:19.379
Zoila! You okay?

03:19.414 --> 03:21.680
I'm fine.

03:21.716 --> 03:23.983
I'm so sorry.
I'll call you later.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.908
Carmen, I've been thinking.

03:48.943 --> 03:51.543
I'm giving you
the day off tomorrow.

03:51.578 --> 03:53.178
What? Why?

03:53.213 --> 03:54.546
Because it's your birthday.

03:54.581 --> 03:56.681
No!

03:56.716 --> 03:58.050
I mean, no.

03:58.085 --> 04:00.785
You're confused.
My birthday's not tomorrow.

04:00.820 --> 04:02.020
Well, of course it is.

04:02.056 --> 04:03.755
I wrote it
in my calendar last year

04:03.790 --> 04:06.357
after you struck me with a
Dustbuster for <i> not</i> remembering.

04:06.392 --> 04:08.726
Well, I'm not
celebrating this year.

04:08.762 --> 04:11.362
Why not? Is there something
different about this birthday?

04:13.099 --> 04:15.299
Are you turning 40?

04:15.334 --> 04:17.233
Don't say the "F" word!

04:17.269 --> 04:19.571
Oh, come on.
40's not so bad.

04:19.606 --> 04:22.373
I'm 37. And sticking.
Now drop it.

04:22.408 --> 04:24.141
Is this because Danni's gone?

04:24.177 --> 04:25.809
Now that you're facing
a milestone,

04:25.844 --> 04:27.478
taking stock in your life,

04:27.513 --> 04:29.947
you're realizing that you let
your only real accomplishment

04:29.982 --> 04:31.882
walk out the door?

04:31.917 --> 04:34.885
No. That's not it.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.955
Danni leaving was a relief.
I never wanted to be a mom.

04:37.990 --> 04:41.324
Now I can focus on being me...
Carmen Luna.

04:42.928 --> 04:45.629
Carmen. The phone.

04:45.664 --> 04:47.163
Yeah, yeah.

04:49.602 --> 04:51.334
Powell residence.

04:51.369 --> 04:53.904
Hey, I was trying
to reach Daniela Mercado.

04:53.939 --> 04:55.338
Oh, she's not in.

04:55.373 --> 04:57.073
Okay, you think I can leave
a message?

04:57.109 --> 04:58.941
I tried her cell,
but I just can't get her.

04:58.977 --> 05:01.177
Probably
because she's out of town.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.579
<i>Oh. Okay.</i>

05:02.614 --> 05:04.814
Um, I guess she'll just miss
this audition.

05:04.849 --> 05:07.083
Wait, what?
What audition?

05:07.119 --> 05:08.651
Um, it's tomorrow.

05:08.686 --> 05:11.588
We're trying out dancers
for a new B.T. Chill video.

05:11.623 --> 05:13.355
B.T. Chill?

05:13.390 --> 05:15.758
The guy with the really high
voice and the really low pants?

05:15.793 --> 05:17.326
He's huge.

05:17.361 --> 05:19.194
Yep.
So I guess it's her loss.

05:19.230 --> 05:21.030
No, no, no, no.
Don't hang up.

05:21.065 --> 05:22.665
Give <i> me</i> the details.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.967
Wait, I thought you just said
she was out of town.

05:25.003 --> 05:27.036
I forgot she's
coming back today.

05:27.071 --> 05:31.540
So tell me where it is,
and Daniela will be there.

05:33.844 --> 05:35.110
Gail.

05:35.146 --> 05:36.711
How nice to see you.

05:36.747 --> 05:40.516
Evelyn, I was just getting my,
um, eyebrows waxed.

05:40.551 --> 05:42.384
I have an eyebrow there, too.

05:44.221 --> 05:46.021
You know, I think
the last time I saw you,

05:46.056 --> 05:48.523
you were getting dragged
out of the country club

05:48.558 --> 05:50.125
kicking and screaming.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.893
I really hope I didn't
exacerbate the situation

05:51.928 --> 05:53.394
by calling you a monster.

05:53.429 --> 05:55.730
No. I understand.
You can't help your behavior.

05:55.766 --> 05:59.701
You're like a feral cat
who's also drunk.

06:01.271 --> 06:04.705
Wow, you seem to be
in an unusually good mood.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.541
I am. I have a date.

06:06.576 --> 06:08.409
That's why I'm here
getting gussied up.

06:08.444 --> 06:10.077
Who's the lucky guy?

06:10.112 --> 06:13.414
Reverend James Hamilton
from the Hamilton House charity.

06:13.449 --> 06:15.883
- He's very handsome.
- I know.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.559
Figure if I'm gonna get back on the
horse, it might as well be a...

06:18.587 --> 06:20.087
Big black stallion?

06:20.122 --> 06:21.722
Gail.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.091
Being around you makes me seem
racially sensitive.

06:24.126 --> 06:25.492
Though I have to say,

06:25.527 --> 06:27.360
I can't really picture you
with a preacher.

06:27.396 --> 06:29.763
I mean,
do they even make money?

06:29.799 --> 06:31.398
Does it matter?
It's just a date.

06:31.433 --> 06:32.900
I don't have to marry the man.

06:32.935 --> 06:37.270
So, is, um... is Adrian
seeing other people, too?

06:37.306 --> 06:39.439
I don't know and I don't care.

06:39.474 --> 06:42.041
Adrian is free to do anything
or anyone he pleases.

06:42.077 --> 06:46.079
Hmm.
Okay, well, have fun.

06:51.485 --> 06:53.786
I can't believe I'm writing

06:53.822 --> 06:56.856
a film being directed
by <i> the</i> Hugh Metzger!

06:56.891 --> 06:58.557
I'm gonna learn so much
from you.

06:58.593 --> 07:00.760
Yeah, well, you know what?
I'm impressed with you, too.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.929
It's amazing how quickly
you wrote that outline.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.296
I lived it.

07:04.332 --> 07:06.599
And the other script
got so much wrong,

07:06.634 --> 07:09.134
I was bursting at the seams
to tell the story my way.

07:09.169 --> 07:10.902
Well, I-I loved what you did
with it.

07:10.938 --> 07:12.538
Thank you.

07:12.573 --> 07:15.274
So, now we can talk
about what we need to change.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.209
Oh, okay. Okay.

07:17.245 --> 07:19.945
I look forward
to hearing your thoughts.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.113
Okay.

07:21.148 --> 07:23.148
Trey, give her my thoughts.

07:23.183 --> 07:25.250
Well, first off,
Hugh had the great idea

07:25.285 --> 07:27.485
to change the setting to Miami.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.789
Yeah, Beverly Hills is just
a little too on-the-nose.

07:30.824 --> 07:33.125
But Beverly Hills
is such a good backdrop

07:33.160 --> 07:35.160
for the themes of class
disparity.

07:35.195 --> 07:36.762
Don't you think?

07:36.797 --> 07:40.298
Yeah, let's, uh...
Let's put a pin in that, okay?

07:40.333 --> 07:42.967
Next, it'd be great if
the maids could be sexier.

07:43.002 --> 07:44.736
Show some skin.

07:44.771 --> 07:47.104
Yeah, what if there's, like,
a room where they all change

07:47.140 --> 07:48.640
before they go
to work every day?

07:48.675 --> 07:50.107
Like, a maids' locker room.

07:50.143 --> 07:52.009
Maids' locker room.
Great idea, Hugh.

07:52.044 --> 07:53.778
Okay, that was my idea,

07:53.813 --> 07:56.681
and I wasn't being serious,
'cause it's not a thing.

07:56.716 --> 08:00.417
Ah, well, let's...
Let's put a pin in that, too.

08:00.452 --> 08:03.487
Beginning to think
"putting a pin in it"

08:03.522 --> 08:05.162
means you're
just gonna change it later.

08:05.191 --> 08:06.991
Wow, you're right.

08:07.026 --> 08:09.026
You are learning a lot from me.

08:11.130 --> 08:13.264
Westmore.

08:13.299 --> 08:16.199
Oh.
Uh, Kill Face.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.001
Heard you were back
from the hospital.

08:18.036 --> 08:19.770
We missed you
at play rehearsal.

08:19.805 --> 08:21.171
That's still happening?

08:21.206 --> 08:23.039
Of course it is.
This Friday.

08:23.074 --> 08:25.108
If you need more time
to prepare,

08:25.143 --> 08:27.377
we can run lines in the shower.

08:27.413 --> 08:29.346
No, I'm good.

08:29.381 --> 08:31.881
And don't worry.
Your family's gonna love it.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.549
My family?

08:33.583 --> 08:36.619
Didn't you invite them?
Friday's family day.

08:36.654 --> 08:39.289
We do a play every year
for the kids.

08:39.323 --> 08:42.025
We just never had
a star like you before.

08:42.059 --> 08:44.861
Oh, thanks.

08:44.896 --> 08:48.464
But do you really think prison
is the best place for children?

08:48.499 --> 08:50.232
Listen to me.

08:50.267 --> 08:52.535
I've been in here a long time.

08:52.570 --> 08:55.404
You get a chance
to hug your family, you take it.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.406
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

08:57.442 --> 09:00.509
I mean, who knows?
You may never see them again...

09:01.879 --> 09:05.347
especially if you're
not off book by Friday.

09:11.255 --> 09:13.588
Oh!
Well, hello there.

09:13.623 --> 09:15.523
You must be the haircut guy.

09:15.559 --> 09:16.758
Come on in.

09:16.793 --> 09:19.061
So, who referred you to me?

09:19.096 --> 09:22.096
I...really must thank them.

09:22.131 --> 09:24.532
Oh.
I don't need a haircut.

09:24.568 --> 09:26.033
You don't?

09:26.069 --> 09:28.870
But I got a text asking
for an at-home appointment.

09:28.905 --> 09:30.304
That was from me.

09:30.340 --> 09:31.606
Wait.

09:31.641 --> 09:34.041
Aren't you
Genevieve Delatour's maid?

09:34.077 --> 09:35.443
Did she put you up to this?

09:35.479 --> 09:37.378
Is that why you tricked me
into coming here?

09:37.413 --> 09:39.213
I'll get back to work.

09:39.249 --> 09:41.883
Hold on. Stay.
I want a witness for this.

09:41.918 --> 09:43.251
Please, Fabian.

09:43.286 --> 09:45.152
Mrs. Genevieve doesn't even know
I called you.

09:45.188 --> 09:47.454
Well, she really hurt me.

09:47.490 --> 09:49.623
Do you know
she thought I was gay?

09:49.658 --> 09:51.658
Can you believe that?

09:51.694 --> 09:54.628
Shocking. Excuse me.

09:54.663 --> 09:58.231
I picked up the book you gave
Mrs. Genevieve about The Circle,

09:58.267 --> 10:01.234
and I thought
it was really interesting.

10:01.270 --> 10:02.302
Mm-hmm.

10:02.337 --> 10:04.738
Fabian, I am talking to you.

10:04.774 --> 10:07.340
What? Oh. Yes.
The book.

10:07.376 --> 10:09.742
I want to know more
about The Circle.

10:09.778 --> 10:11.011
Can I join?

10:11.046 --> 10:12.845
You?

10:12.881 --> 10:15.916
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

10:15.951 --> 10:17.284
Why not?

10:17.319 --> 10:20.954
Sweetheart, our members
are very chichi...

10:20.989 --> 10:22.655
politicians, celebs.

10:22.690 --> 10:27.026
I mean, for God's sakes...
Peri Westmore was in The Circle.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.194
She was?

10:29.230 --> 10:32.432
The point is,
you don't choose us.

10:32.467 --> 10:33.999
We choose you.

10:34.035 --> 10:38.003
And let's be honest, no one
is ever going to choose you.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.506
See ya.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.977
Did you hear that?
Peri was in The Circle.

10:45.012 --> 10:48.047
Maybe she wanted out,
and that's why they killed her.

10:48.082 --> 10:52.017
I just wish I could get inside,
but they only want rich people.

10:52.053 --> 10:53.986
So what are you gonna do now?

10:54.021 --> 10:56.388
I don't have a choice.

10:56.424 --> 10:59.858
I got to get Mrs. Genevieve
to join the cult.

11:02.108 --> 11:05.412
Ouch! You must
really like this guy

11:05.447 --> 11:07.068
to climb out of a window
for him.

11:07.103 --> 11:08.565
I won't even drive
to the Valley for a guy,

11:08.601 --> 11:10.067
no matter how hot he is.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.469
I think it's weird

11:11.504 --> 11:13.570
that Kyle won't tell his mother
he's seeing you.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.539
I know, but we're still in the,

11:15.574 --> 11:17.908
"He's so hot I don't want
to question it," phase

11:17.943 --> 11:19.543
of our relationship.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.778
You know the mom. Why don't
you just talk to her yourself?

11:21.814 --> 11:23.714
Honestly, I think
she'd be fine with it,

11:23.749 --> 11:25.415
but Kyle asked me
not to tell her.

11:25.450 --> 11:27.784
Maybe she can find out
by accident.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.386
You know,
that's not the worst idea.

11:29.421 --> 11:30.821
Aw.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.056
I always like it when
I don't have the worst idea.

11:34.760 --> 11:38.962
Here's a decaf, triple-shot,
skinny latte for Carmen

11:38.998 --> 11:40.763
and whatever these are
for you guys.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.434
Mmm!

11:44.469 --> 11:46.829
They always get my order wrong.
What is so hard about black?

11:46.838 --> 11:48.438
Why do we even come
to this place?

11:48.473 --> 11:49.972
Because that barista
thinks I'm hot,

11:50.008 --> 11:51.607
and I never have to pay
for my drinks.

11:51.643 --> 11:52.842
But we do.

11:52.877 --> 11:54.411
So,<i> 'Manita,</i>

11:54.446 --> 11:56.479
what do you want to do
for your big birthday tomorrow?

11:56.515 --> 11:58.648
Shh!
It's not my birthday.

11:58.683 --> 12:00.983
Aw, is someone upset
about turning 40?

12:01.019 --> 12:03.419
Ow! Ohh!

12:03.454 --> 12:05.154
I'm not turning the "F" word.

12:05.189 --> 12:06.656
Sweetie, you've turned 37

12:06.691 --> 12:08.524
for the last three years
in a row.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.626
You're 40!
We should celebrate!

12:10.662 --> 12:12.494
I can't.
I have an audition

12:12.530 --> 12:14.996
for a B.T. Chill
music video.

12:15.032 --> 12:16.465
How'd you snag that?

12:16.500 --> 12:18.534
Well, technically,
Danni got the audition,

12:18.569 --> 12:22.171
but she's not around,
so I'm gonna go in as her.

12:22.206 --> 12:24.273
You're stealing
your own daughter's audition?

12:24.308 --> 12:25.607
That is not right.

12:25.642 --> 12:27.209
It's what Daniela
would have wanted.

12:27.244 --> 12:29.010
She's in Puerto Rico,
not heaven.

12:29.046 --> 12:30.647
Besides, they're expecting
a 20-year-old.

12:30.681 --> 12:32.047
What do you think they'll say

12:32.082 --> 12:35.617
when they see you looking
all... not 20?

12:35.652 --> 12:37.652
People think I'm in my 20s
all the time, honey.

12:37.688 --> 12:38.787
Trust me.

12:38.822 --> 12:40.655
I still got it.

12:40.691 --> 12:42.857
Here you go, ladies.
Separate checks.

12:42.893 --> 12:44.459
Oh.

12:47.530 --> 12:49.697
Wait.
I always get mine free.

12:49.732 --> 12:51.532
Sorry, Carmen.
Not today.

12:52.502 --> 12:53.701
Ooh!

12:53.736 --> 12:54.969
Maybe you don't still got it.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.575
Adrian's hidden all the money.

13:00.610 --> 13:02.910
He retained every divorce
attorney in this town.

13:02.945 --> 13:04.377
He won't even let me
into my own home.

13:04.413 --> 13:06.480
Hmm.
Oh, you poor thing.

13:06.515 --> 13:07.881
You don't want
to listen to me complain

13:07.917 --> 13:09.182
about my
soon-to-be ex-husband.

13:09.218 --> 13:10.684
Oh, no, I don't mind.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.720
I'm actually planning
a sermon on the devil.

13:12.755 --> 13:14.187
This is really good material.

13:16.058 --> 13:18.391
I didn't realize ministers were
allowed to have a sense of humor.

13:18.427 --> 13:21.428
Well, we're not, so please don't
tell the other ministers.

13:21.463 --> 13:24.564
James, I must say...

13:24.600 --> 13:27.200
this date is going better
than I hoped.

13:27.236 --> 13:29.503
Oh, you thought I'd be
a real dud, huh?

13:29.538 --> 13:33.273
I was afraid you might be
a bit of a... goody-goody.

13:34.943 --> 13:37.010
Well, trust me, Evelyn.

13:37.045 --> 13:39.946
I'm no saint.

13:39.981 --> 13:41.280
Reverend.

13:41.315 --> 13:42.548
Oh, hello, Laverne.

13:43.818 --> 13:45.118
I just wanted
to thank you again

13:45.153 --> 13:46.886
for everything you did
for my family.

13:46.921 --> 13:49.555
The money you raised for Timmy's
surgery was a Godsend.

13:49.590 --> 13:51.357
You should really thank
Dr. Levin.

13:51.392 --> 13:52.792
I'm so glad he and I
stayed in touch

13:52.826 --> 13:54.926
after we volunteered in Africa.

13:54.962 --> 13:57.129
Hey, Timmy.
How you doing, buddy?

13:57.165 --> 14:00.032
My doctor says soon
I'll be running and playing

14:00.067 --> 14:01.900
just like the other boys.

14:01.935 --> 14:04.736
You must be a very special woman
to be with the reverend.

14:04.772 --> 14:06.805
Best man in the entire world.

14:06.840 --> 14:07.906
Yes.

14:07.941 --> 14:10.241
I am starting to see that.

14:10.277 --> 14:12.577
So, you haven't said anything

14:12.612 --> 14:14.146
about your meeting
with Hugh and Trey.

14:14.181 --> 14:15.580
It doesn't feel right

14:15.615 --> 14:18.416
to use our relationship
to talk about them.

14:18.451 --> 14:23.121
They said you were very
difficult and not collaborative.

14:23.157 --> 14:24.756
They're morons.

14:24.792 --> 14:25.990
That's better.

14:26.025 --> 14:28.926
And their ideas stink.
I don't even know who Trey is.

14:28.961 --> 14:31.496
Some guy who gets paid
to sit there and agree?

14:31.531 --> 14:34.065
In Hollywood, they call that
a producing partner.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.834
They were so critical.
I felt like I was under attack.

14:36.869 --> 14:38.236
But that's the process.

14:38.271 --> 14:40.071
Just try not to take it
so personally.

14:40.106 --> 14:42.339
I poured my heart and soul
into that book.

14:42.374 --> 14:44.408
Maybe you're too close to it.

14:44.443 --> 14:46.844
Those guys are
critiquing the material.

14:46.879 --> 14:49.113
- They're not critiquing you.
- All right, okay.

14:49.148 --> 14:50.614
Look,

14:50.649 --> 14:52.282
they just want to feel like
they're being heard.

14:52.318 --> 14:53.818
Don't say "no" to their notes.

14:53.853 --> 14:55.920
Just try something like,
"Well, that's interesting.

14:55.955 --> 14:58.122
Let me think about it."

14:58.157 --> 15:00.190
Then can I ignore them
and do whatever I want?

15:02.027 --> 15:05.128
How about if you get a note
that's particularly terrible,

15:05.163 --> 15:06.496
you bring it to me.

15:06.532 --> 15:07.997
I'll back you up.

15:08.033 --> 15:11.435
Mm, dating the head
of the studio has its perks.

15:11.470 --> 15:13.169
Hmm, speaking of which,

15:13.205 --> 15:15.538
I've got that shareholder
meeting in New York this week.

15:15.573 --> 15:18.274
Why don't we make the most
of the time we have left?

15:18.309 --> 15:20.376
I love that idea.

15:20.411 --> 15:23.512
You see?
I am collaborative as hell.

15:25.717 --> 15:26.883
Mm.

15:26.918 --> 15:28.484
Listen, Rosie,

15:28.519 --> 15:30.887
I want you and the boys to come
to family day on Friday.

15:30.922 --> 15:34.624
Oh, Miguel has school,
but I can bring Tucker.

15:34.659 --> 15:36.525
Ah, that would be great.
I would love to see him.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.662
Spence, did you know Peri
was in a cult?

15:39.697 --> 15:41.830
- <i>You're kidding.</i>
- Mnhmnh.

15:41.866 --> 15:45.234
It turns out The Circle is a cult,
and Peri was in it.

15:45.270 --> 15:48.737
Rosie, I thought you were gonna
stop looking into Peri's murder.

15:48.773 --> 15:49.805
These people are dangerous.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.506
<i>I love you, Spence.</i>

15:51.541 --> 15:54.576
No matter how risky it is,
I can't just give up on you.

15:54.611 --> 15:57.146
But I wish you would.

15:57.181 --> 16:00.182
Just promise me
You won't do anything crazy

16:00.217 --> 16:01.683
like try to join this cult.

16:01.718 --> 16:02.918
We...

16:02.953 --> 16:04.519
Um, I have to go, but I promise

16:04.554 --> 16:07.021
<i>I</i> will not join the cult,
mm-hmm.

16:07.056 --> 16:09.658
Rosie, I'm off to the club.

16:09.693 --> 16:11.660
Oh. Really?

16:11.695 --> 16:14.195
You're going out with your hair
looking like that?

16:14.230 --> 16:15.697
What's wrong with my hair?

16:15.732 --> 16:17.064
Mm...

16:17.100 --> 16:18.366
nothing, but...

16:18.402 --> 16:20.168
But what?

16:20.203 --> 16:23.537
It just hasn't looked as good
since you stopped seeing Fabian.

16:23.572 --> 16:26.107
What are you talking about?

16:27.410 --> 16:29.576
My hair looks perfect.

16:29.612 --> 16:32.880
I just think Fabian
made it look extra special.

16:32.916 --> 16:35.716
He did give an amazing blowout.

16:35.751 --> 16:37.251
But he insulted me.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.454
Besides, he's involved
with that awful cult.

16:40.489 --> 16:42.589
It doesn't seem that bad.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.958
And cults are a great place
to meet new people,

16:44.993 --> 16:47.260
maybe a new man, huh?

16:47.296 --> 16:50.197
Rosie, what's going on?

16:50.232 --> 16:53.033
Is this
about Peri's murder again?

16:53.068 --> 16:56.069
I think the cult had something
to do with it,

16:56.104 --> 16:59.306
but The Circle doesn't want me,
because I'm not rich...

16:59.341 --> 17:00.740
like you are.

17:00.775 --> 17:03.109
You mean you want <i> me</i>
to join the cult?

17:03.145 --> 17:06.746
I know it might seem dangerous,
and it's a lot to ask.

17:06.781 --> 17:08.882
Well,
why didn't you just say so?

17:08.916 --> 17:11.282
- I'll join.
- You will?

17:11.319 --> 17:14.987
Well, don't look so shocked.
I've belonged to a cult before.

17:15.021 --> 17:17.623
In my defense, it was the '80s,

17:17.659 --> 17:20.059
and I thought it was
an exercise class.

17:21.663 --> 17:24.230
I must say I was surprised
when you invited me over.

17:24.265 --> 17:26.566
Why? We've been getting
to know each other lately.

17:26.601 --> 17:28.667
We're... buds.

17:28.702 --> 17:30.469
Buds.

17:30.504 --> 17:32.137
I like the sound of that.

17:32.173 --> 17:34.506
Truthfully, I don't have
many female friends

17:34.541 --> 17:35.975
or male friends.

17:36.010 --> 17:37.609
Please.

17:37.644 --> 17:40.279
Aren't you friends with all
those rich people at the club?

17:40.314 --> 17:42.147
Oh, they're
mostly acquaintances.

17:42.183 --> 17:45.283
Sometimes they <i> act</i> like friends
when they need a favor.

17:47.788 --> 17:49.020
You need a favor.

17:49.055 --> 17:50.154
No!

17:51.057 --> 17:53.091
Okay, yes.

17:53.126 --> 17:54.860
I need you to invite Frances
to lunch

17:54.895 --> 17:56.628
and then cancel
at the last minute.

17:56.663 --> 17:58.029
And why would I do that?

17:58.064 --> 18:00.298
Because I need her
to come home unexpectedly

18:00.333 --> 18:02.200
and find me
in bed with her son.

18:02.235 --> 18:04.435
Oh, how deliciously kinky.

18:04.470 --> 18:06.470
This is why
you don't have friends.

18:06.506 --> 18:09.607
Look, I'm tired of keeping
my relationship a secret,

18:09.642 --> 18:12.110
but <i> I</i> can't
tell Frances directly, so...

18:12.145 --> 18:16.381
You want her to catch you
in <i>flagrante delicto</i>!

18:16.416 --> 18:17.681
I'm in.

18:17.717 --> 18:19.617
I wouldn't go
through all the trouble,

18:19.652 --> 18:21.952
but Kyle is weird
about his mother,

18:21.987 --> 18:23.854
almost like he's scared of her.

18:23.890 --> 18:27.892
W-Why in the world would anyone
be scared of Frances?

18:27.927 --> 18:29.827
Kyle is my actual son,

18:29.862 --> 18:32.996
but everyone
in The Circle is my child.

18:33.032 --> 18:37.567
And when I ask one of my
children to handle a situation,

18:37.602 --> 18:39.403
I expect it to be handled.

18:39.438 --> 18:41.571
I'm sorry, Mother.

18:41.606 --> 18:44.474
Someone's going around asking
about Peri's murder.

18:44.509 --> 18:46.209
Rosie.

18:46.245 --> 18:48.345
And if she figures out
the truth,

18:48.380 --> 18:51.648
we're all in danger...
our entire family.

18:53.885 --> 18:55.919
- I'll take care of it.
- Good.

18:55.954 --> 19:00.323
And, Ben, don't disappoint
your mother again.

19:06.806 --> 19:08.506
Okay, name.

19:08.541 --> 19:09.841
Daniela Mercado.

19:10.176 --> 19:12.143
This says your name
is Carmen Luna.

19:12.178 --> 19:14.612
Oh.
That's just my stage name.

19:14.648 --> 19:16.747
Okay, whatever your name is,

19:16.783 --> 19:19.884
I don't think you're exactly
what we are looking for.

19:19.919 --> 19:22.386
You're not looking
for hot, sexy dancers?

19:22.421 --> 19:25.222
We are looking for
Girls who are a little more...

19:25.258 --> 19:27.224
born in the last two decades.

19:27.260 --> 19:28.959
Let me tell you something.

19:28.995 --> 19:32.262
Today is not the day
to tell me that I'm too old!

19:32.298 --> 19:35.965
I came here to dance,
and I'm going to dance!

19:36.001 --> 19:38.502
Okay. Okay.

19:38.537 --> 19:39.936
You can warm up over there.

19:45.977 --> 19:49.779
Aw, I didn't know they were
casting the mom in this video.

19:51.850 --> 19:55.451
I'm so happy we put
all that ugliness behind us.

19:55.486 --> 19:58.121
Me too.
I hate fighting with you.

19:58.156 --> 20:01.357
I just wish I'd read
that book you gave me sooner.

20:01.392 --> 20:03.860
It's really changed
my whole perspective.

20:03.895 --> 20:05.761
Well, hallelu,
she's seen the light.

20:07.664 --> 20:10.598
So, you'll introduce me
to your friends in The Circle?

20:10.634 --> 20:13.601
Not so fast.
There's a process.

20:13.637 --> 20:15.637
If you're truly committed.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.340
Of course I am.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.174
Whatever it takes.

20:23.313 --> 20:24.645
What's all this?

20:24.680 --> 20:26.547
Well, before anybody joins
The Circle,

20:26.582 --> 20:30.451
we have to analyze
their commitment.

20:30.486 --> 20:32.119
Hold these.

20:32.155 --> 20:33.721
Is this gonna hurt?

20:33.756 --> 20:35.356
No. No.

20:35.391 --> 20:37.391
I'm just gonna ask some
questions about your life,

20:37.426 --> 20:39.526
and the machine tells me
whether you answer honestly.

20:39.562 --> 20:41.061
You don't have to worry
about that.

20:41.096 --> 20:42.229
I'm an open book.

20:42.264 --> 20:45.165
Good.
Let's start with your age.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.234
- Hmm?
- Your age?

20:48.404 --> 20:50.136
Oh.

20:50.172 --> 20:51.171
35.

20:54.343 --> 20:56.042
45.

20:56.078 --> 20:59.479
Genevieve, I thought you were
serious about this.

20:59.514 --> 21:01.214
55?

21:03.218 --> 21:05.085
Wait. Okay.

21:07.055 --> 21:09.890
It starts with... a six.

21:09.925 --> 21:11.892
I'll take that.

21:11.927 --> 21:13.860
Now, let's move on
to something easier.

21:13.895 --> 21:16.496
Oh, could we?
That would be wonderful.

21:16.531 --> 21:17.764
How much do you weigh?

21:19.801 --> 21:21.534
I'm so sorry, Frances.

21:21.569 --> 21:23.603
I have to cancel
our lunch last minute.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.039
You should go on home.

21:27.074 --> 21:29.575
We'll do it another time.

21:29.611 --> 21:31.576
Bye, now.

21:31.612 --> 21:35.447
Adrian, how do you feel about
the placement of these sofas?

21:35.482 --> 21:37.116
Oh, Gail,
I trust your judgment.

21:37.151 --> 21:38.918
You have a wonderful eye.

21:38.953 --> 21:42.254
I have
other wonderful things, too.

21:42.290 --> 21:43.956
Don't you think?

21:43.991 --> 21:45.391
Beg your pardon?

21:45.426 --> 21:48.427
Well, you said I have
a wonderful eye.

21:48.462 --> 21:52.898
I've also heard I have
a wonderful... butt.

21:52.933 --> 21:55.567
I'm sorry.
I just came in for a Bourbon.

21:55.602 --> 21:58.703
Adrian, would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?

21:58.739 --> 22:00.605
You're friends with Evelyn.

22:00.641 --> 22:02.574
Doesn't this
seem... inappropriate?

22:02.609 --> 22:04.809
Evelyn's not
in the picture anymore.

22:04.844 --> 22:08.379
There's no reason to deny
the deep sexual tension

22:08.415 --> 22:10.315
that's always been between us.

22:11.318 --> 22:14.452
Is it possible you're unclear on
the meaning of sexual tension?

22:16.256 --> 22:18.423
Don't act like you haven't
thought about it.

22:18.458 --> 22:20.991
I've caught you staring
at my breasts before.

22:21.026 --> 22:23.727
You took them out
at a dinner party.

22:23.763 --> 22:26.464
- I was caught by surprise.
- Come on, Adrian.

22:26.499 --> 22:31.134
You're a sexual deviant,
and I am game for anything.

22:31.170 --> 22:34.404
And I do mean anything.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.074
G-Gail, I'm flattered,
but I'm married.

22:37.109 --> 22:40.477
Now, this situation
with Evelyn is only temporary.

22:40.512 --> 22:42.112
I know she'll come back to me.

22:42.147 --> 22:43.413
Hmm.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.615
I wouldn't be so sure.

22:45.650 --> 22:48.185
Haven't you heard?
Evelyn is seeing someone.

22:48.220 --> 22:50.687
She's been dating
James Hamilton.

22:50.722 --> 22:53.456
- Reverend Hamilton?
- Mmhmm.

22:53.492 --> 22:55.024
They met at the gala,

22:55.059 --> 22:57.861
and things have been
hot and heavy ever since.

22:57.896 --> 23:02.298
Well, you give it some thought,
and remember,

23:02.333 --> 23:05.334
my door is always open...

23:05.370 --> 23:07.169
if you know what I mean.

23:07.205 --> 23:09.305
It's impossible not to.

23:13.177 --> 23:15.844
Before we start, I want
to apologize for yesterday.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.780
I got defensive, but I know
none of this is personal.

23:18.816 --> 23:21.984
Great, because we need to talk
about the big note.

23:22.020 --> 23:24.786
- I'm ready. Fire away.
- Okay.

23:24.822 --> 23:28.891
The character of Maria, the one
pretending to be a maid...

23:28.926 --> 23:30.893
- She's really, um...
- Unlikeable.

23:30.928 --> 23:32.193
Yeah.

23:32.229 --> 23:34.963
Um, this is a bit awkward,

23:34.999 --> 23:36.865
but the character of Maria
is based on me.

23:36.901 --> 23:38.500
Oh, no, of course.

23:38.536 --> 23:40.402
But the way she's written...
I mean, she's just no fun.

23:40.437 --> 23:42.203
I mean, who'd want to hang out
with that gal?

23:42.239 --> 23:44.239
Yeah, you know the one
I really like... her friend...

23:44.274 --> 23:45.873
the hot one who's trying
to be a singer.

23:45.909 --> 23:47.242
- Mm, Carmelita.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:47.277 --> 23:48.876
Yeah, I want
to do tequila shots with her.

23:48.912 --> 23:52.747
But it's not right for Maria.
She's trying to save her son.

23:52.782 --> 23:56.217
Yeah, about that...
I don't buy it.

23:56.253 --> 23:57.685
But it happened.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.254
Going undercover,
putting herself at risk,

24:00.289 --> 24:02.557
lying to her friends...
She seems crazy.

24:02.592 --> 24:04.158
Yeah, no,
a woman doesn't do that.

24:04.193 --> 24:05.660
Now, look, I got three ex-wives
and a daughter.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.394
I <i> know</i> women.

24:07.430 --> 24:11.165
So, you should see that Maria

24:11.200 --> 24:14.201
is strong and determined.

24:14.236 --> 24:16.870
If she were a man,
You would find that admirable.

24:16.905 --> 24:19.440
You're absolutely right.
Maria should be a man.

24:19.475 --> 24:20.607
Genius!

24:20.642 --> 24:22.376
What? No.
Not genius!

24:22.411 --> 24:23.944
Oh, now it makes sense.

24:23.979 --> 24:26.746
- I totally buy that coming from a man.
- Mmhmm.

24:26.782 --> 24:30.917
You're saying that a man
goes undercover as a maid?

24:30.953 --> 24:32.919
He pretends to be a woman.

24:32.955 --> 24:35.254
- Like Mrs. Doubtfire.
- Yes!

24:35.290 --> 24:36.723
Oh! Will Ferrell
would be perfect!

24:37.793 --> 24:40.126
Will Ferrell as Maria?!

24:40.161 --> 24:41.227
What do you think?

24:44.432 --> 24:46.733
I'm hungry.
Let's go grab a bite somewhere.

24:46.768 --> 24:49.569
No.
Let's stay in bed and cuddle.

24:49.604 --> 24:50.970
Mm.

24:51.005 --> 24:53.272
Did you hear that?

24:54.409 --> 24:57.911
- <i>Kyle, you upstairs?</i>
- Oh, God, not again.

24:57.946 --> 25:00.446
Oh, shoot.
She's back.

25:00.481 --> 25:02.548
I guess she's gonna
find out about us.

25:02.583 --> 25:03.944
Okay, you got to go
out the window.

25:03.952 --> 25:06.251
No.
I'm not going anywhere!

25:06.287 --> 25:07.620
Oh, yes, you are.

25:07.655 --> 25:10.255
No!
You are so strong!

25:10.291 --> 25:11.056
Ohh!

25:12.727 --> 25:14.293
Everything okay up here?

25:16.297 --> 25:18.864
Hello, Frances.

25:18.900 --> 25:21.400
What's going on?

25:21.435 --> 25:25.103
I guess the cat's
out of the bag.

25:25.139 --> 25:27.105
Kyle and I are dating again.

25:28.742 --> 25:30.042
I'm so sorry, Mother.

25:30.077 --> 25:33.045
Stop.
There's no need to apologize.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.814
We're all adults here,
right, Frances?

25:35.849 --> 25:37.949
Get out of my house.

25:39.619 --> 25:40.618
Excuse me?

25:40.654 --> 25:42.787
I said get out!

25:42.823 --> 25:45.590
You are no longer welcome
in this house.

25:53.166 --> 25:56.067
Carmen Luna. Lucy Nestor.

26:00.830 --> 26:02.897
I'm dancing against her?

26:02.933 --> 26:03.998
Try and keep up.

26:44.539 --> 26:46.106
Thank you.
Lucy...

26:46.141 --> 26:47.540
you can go.

26:47.576 --> 26:48.941
Carmen...

26:48.977 --> 26:50.076
stay.

26:50.112 --> 26:51.744
We'd like to see more.

26:51.779 --> 26:53.045
Yes!

26:53.081 --> 26:55.448
Yes! You take that,
you little hater!

26:55.484 --> 26:57.783
You can kiss my... Aah!

26:58.753 --> 26:59.852
Okay, next two dancers.

26:59.887 --> 27:02.021
Carmen, clear the stage.

27:05.292 --> 27:07.126
Wait a minute. Did you just
throw your back out?

27:07.161 --> 27:09.228
No, no, I'm fine.

27:09.263 --> 27:11.196
I'm just resting.

27:11.232 --> 27:14.967
On second thought, Carmen,
I think we've seen enough.

27:17.571 --> 27:19.105
There.

27:19.140 --> 27:22.107
Oh, Rosie, it was torture.

27:22.143 --> 27:23.475
I'm so sorry.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.877
What did Fabian do to you?

27:25.912 --> 27:28.280
He asked me
deeply personal questions.

27:28.315 --> 27:32.151
And he wouldn't quit
until he broke me.

27:32.186 --> 27:33.585
I am broken.

27:33.621 --> 27:35.454
What were the questions?

27:35.489 --> 27:38.823
My age, my weight,

27:38.859 --> 27:42.627
which parts of me are real
and which are fake.

27:42.663 --> 27:44.896
So he wanted
to know your secrets.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.831
He even made me tell him

27:46.867 --> 27:50.168
every sordid detail
of my sexual history.

27:50.203 --> 27:53.337
Of course,
That part I rather enjoyed.

27:53.373 --> 27:55.839
Does everyone
have to answer these questions

27:55.875 --> 27:57.608
before they get
into The Circle?

27:57.644 --> 27:59.977
That's what he said.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.180
It's part of the initiation.

28:02.215 --> 28:04.615
So Peri must have done it, too.

28:04.651 --> 28:07.351
If she did,
there'll be a recording.

28:07.387 --> 28:09.287
He filmed the whole thing.

28:09.322 --> 28:12.022
I've got to find that video.

28:12.058 --> 28:17.058
If Peri had a secret,
maybe it got her killed.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.930
Are you actually defending
your mother?

28:19.965 --> 28:22.465
We caught her off-guard.
She doesn't like surprises.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.101
She's crazy!

28:24.136 --> 28:25.468
One minute,
I'm her best friend.

28:25.504 --> 28:27.036
The next minute,
she's kicking me out.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.138
She's not mad at you.
She's mad at me.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.441
She thinks if I'm dating
someone, I'll be distracted.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.443
From what?

28:33.478 --> 28:35.545
You're upset.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.180
Let me pour you a drink.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.349
You know what?
I think your mother's jealous.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.619
She's afraid I'm gonna take away
her little boy.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.121
She's just overly protective.

28:45.156 --> 28:47.690
So tell her to back off.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.794
We just need to give her
some more time, okay?

28:51.830 --> 28:53.229
She'll come around.

28:53.264 --> 28:55.664
I'm not gonna <i> wait</i>
for her to come around.

28:55.700 --> 28:56.866
Zoila, please.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.635
Kyle, you are a grown man.

28:59.670 --> 29:03.839
If you can't stand up to your
mother, then this is over.

29:11.349 --> 29:13.716
Oh, Evelyn,
can you give me a hand?

29:13.751 --> 29:15.083
I'm sorry.

29:15.119 --> 29:16.718
I'm very busy learning
how to be a better,

29:16.754 --> 29:18.653
more considerate person.

29:18.688 --> 29:21.022
Well, so far, so good.

29:21.058 --> 29:22.590
Are you reading the Bible?

29:22.626 --> 29:24.726
I'm studying up
for my next date with James.

29:24.762 --> 29:28.730
I'd like to strike the right
balance of sexy but pious.

29:28.766 --> 29:31.399
Oh!
You really like this guy.

29:31.434 --> 29:32.900
I'm just as surprised
as you are.

29:32.935 --> 29:34.535
Here I was thinking I was
too good for him.

29:34.571 --> 29:36.904
It turns out it's just
the opposite.

29:36.939 --> 29:38.740
What happened?

29:38.775 --> 29:41.242
He's just... kind.

29:41.278 --> 29:43.177
He wants
to make the world better.

29:43.212 --> 29:45.846
Sounds like a breath
of fresh air after Adrian.

29:45.882 --> 29:47.948
Exactly. Now,
if you'll excuse me,

29:47.984 --> 29:50.084
I need to revamp
my entire personality.

29:58.294 --> 30:00.060
All right, take this
to the truck

30:00.096 --> 30:02.386
and ask Rafael
to help with the rest.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.566
Are you James Hamilton?

30:05.601 --> 30:07.101
I am.

30:07.136 --> 30:08.435
Are you here to volunteer?

30:08.471 --> 30:10.670
No, not likely.

30:10.706 --> 30:12.106
I heard about the work you do,

30:12.141 --> 30:13.873
and I wanted
to see it for myself.

30:13.909 --> 30:16.676
Well, I'm always proud to tell
people about Hamilton House.

30:16.712 --> 30:18.178
Well, over the years,

30:18.214 --> 30:19.413
we've helped thousands
of children who don't have...

30:19.448 --> 30:20.780
You don't have to sell me, Rev.

30:20.816 --> 30:23.249
I've already written you
a check.

30:23.284 --> 30:25.317
Well, that was easy.

30:27.089 --> 30:29.022
Wow.
That's, um...

30:29.057 --> 30:30.389
Impressive?

30:30.425 --> 30:31.905
Of course,
there are strings attached.

30:31.927 --> 30:33.426
Strings?

30:33.461 --> 30:36.596
Yes. Perhaps I should
introduce myself.

30:36.632 --> 30:39.031
- I'm Adrian Powell.
- Oh.

30:39.066 --> 30:41.367
I'm giving you this donation
on one condition...

30:41.402 --> 30:43.902
You stay away from my wife.

30:43.938 --> 30:45.560
- Mr. Powell...
- Think of all the

30:45.562 --> 30:46.972
good you could do with it.

30:47.008 --> 30:48.541
You can't possibly
choose Evelyn

30:48.576 --> 30:51.444
over the needs of the poor,
sweet children.

30:51.479 --> 30:53.646
Can you?

30:53.681 --> 30:55.614
Go on, take it.

30:55.650 --> 30:58.050
Really, it's
the Christian thing to do.

31:02.198 --> 31:04.954
I am so sorry to get you
involved like this.

31:04.989 --> 31:06.674
I told you I have your back.

31:06.709 --> 31:09.170
Yeah, but you shouldn't have to
fight your girlfriend's battles.

31:09.205 --> 31:11.707
I'm not here
because you're my girlfriend.

31:11.742 --> 31:14.531
I'm here because you're a writer
that I believe in.

31:14.596 --> 31:16.296
Okay?

31:16.332 --> 31:18.365
Ah, if you get called
into the big boss' office,

31:18.400 --> 31:19.967
there better be Scotch
and hookers.

31:20.002 --> 31:21.301
I'm just kidding.

31:21.337 --> 31:22.869
I hate Scotch.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.306
Well, I thought we should all get
on the same page about the script.

31:27.342 --> 31:29.075
Couldn't agree more.
Me too.

31:29.110 --> 31:33.145
First off,
Maria won't be a man.

31:33.181 --> 31:35.348
It... It changes the tone
of the whole piece.

31:35.383 --> 31:37.684
And you think people will buy it
if it's a woman?

31:37.719 --> 31:40.519
I mean, that, uh,
Marisol is nuts.

31:40.554 --> 31:43.155
I'm Marisol.
The character is Maria.

31:43.191 --> 31:44.991
Oh.

31:45.026 --> 31:50.026
I think Maria and Marisol are
both layered and interesting.

31:50.865 --> 31:54.033
Fine, just make sure
you cast someone thin.

31:54.068 --> 31:55.667
Yeah, not one of those
fat-tresses

31:55.703 --> 31:57.002
that are all the rage
right now.

31:57.037 --> 32:00.338
Oh, my God, that...

32:00.374 --> 32:01.406
is fine.

32:01.441 --> 32:02.875
You know, um,

32:02.910 --> 32:04.943
as long as we're being candid
and everything,

32:04.979 --> 32:07.078
I've got to tell you that, um,

32:07.114 --> 32:09.915
I'm not feeling great
about your choice of writer.

32:12.987 --> 32:14.707
We tried this movie
with a different writer,

32:14.721 --> 32:15.953
and it didn't work.

32:15.989 --> 32:18.390
We brought Marisol in
to get it right.

32:18.425 --> 32:21.759
Well, be that as it may,
I've made up my mind.

32:21.794 --> 32:24.529
So it's either her or me.

32:24.564 --> 32:27.865
Oh, well, fine.

32:27.901 --> 32:30.234
We'll get another director.

32:30.269 --> 32:31.769
Maybe even a woman.

32:31.804 --> 32:33.571
Come on.

32:33.606 --> 32:34.906
Hugh's made millions
for the studio.

32:34.941 --> 32:36.641
He has two Oscars.

32:36.676 --> 32:38.976
I don't think <i> he's</i> the one
who's off the project.

32:40.613 --> 32:42.547
Peter?

32:47.119 --> 32:50.387
Marisol...
look, I'm sorry.

32:50.423 --> 32:53.957
Oh... no.

32:56.962 --> 32:59.163
I get it.

32:59.198 --> 33:00.797
Excuse me.

33:11.043 --> 33:12.642
Genevieve Delatour?

33:12.678 --> 33:14.578
All her deepest and darkest.

33:14.613 --> 33:18.181
I thought she couldn't be
recruited.

33:18.216 --> 33:20.816
Well done.

33:20.851 --> 33:22.118
I need to speak to you, Mother.

33:22.153 --> 33:23.953
Alone.

33:23.988 --> 33:27.755
Ooh, Glasses is in a mood.

33:27.791 --> 33:31.826
Kyle, I don't want to fight.

33:31.861 --> 33:34.596
My whole life,
I have never said no to you,

33:34.631 --> 33:35.930
but Zoila makes me happy.

33:35.966 --> 33:37.199
Why can't I be with her?

33:37.234 --> 33:38.800
Zoila is a discontent.

33:38.835 --> 33:41.470
You've already changed
under her influence.

33:41.505 --> 33:43.605
You're afraid of her.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.841
You think that she'll lure me
away from you and The Circle.

33:46.876 --> 33:50.712
That relationship is over,
and so is this conversation.

33:50.747 --> 33:52.213
Understood?

33:52.248 --> 33:54.548
Go to hell, Mother.

33:59.855 --> 34:01.955
Oh, my God.
Carmen, are you okay?

34:01.991 --> 34:04.191
I'll be fine. Ow.

34:04.227 --> 34:06.127
Oh, what can I get you?

34:06.162 --> 34:08.362
A decaf latte would be nice.

34:08.397 --> 34:09.830
Of course.

34:09.864 --> 34:11.364
That's $5.95.

34:13.268 --> 34:14.701
Oh, God. Um...

34:14.737 --> 34:17.137
Why are you crying?

34:17.172 --> 34:19.472
My life is a total mess.

34:19.507 --> 34:21.041
No. No, it's not.

34:21.076 --> 34:23.342
I don't have a career
or a husband.

34:23.378 --> 34:25.512
And I was supposed
to be a star, you know?

34:25.547 --> 34:27.547
I mean, that's why I gave up
Danni, you know?

34:27.581 --> 34:31.351
- Danni?
- I've wasted my whole life,

34:31.386 --> 34:33.652
and I can't get free coffee
because I'm 40,

34:33.688 --> 34:35.821
and even <i> you</i> don't think
I'm hot anymore!

34:35.857 --> 34:37.690
Ow!

34:37.725 --> 34:39.659
Carmen.
Carmen, look at me.

34:39.694 --> 34:41.327
Look, you see that?

34:41.362 --> 34:42.762
The boss installed it last week

34:42.797 --> 34:44.864
to make sure
we don't give stuff away.

34:46.534 --> 34:47.900
Really?

34:47.935 --> 34:50.936
If it were up to me,
you'd always get free coffee

34:50.972 --> 34:53.773
and free scones and muffins.

34:53.808 --> 34:55.708
So you still think I'm hot?

34:55.743 --> 34:59.444
Carmen, I think you're
the most beautiful woman

34:59.480 --> 35:01.047
in the whole world.

35:09.723 --> 35:11.756
I can't believe
that just happened.

35:11.792 --> 35:14.626
Me, neither.

35:16.597 --> 35:18.930
Ohh, hey, kid.

35:21.134 --> 35:22.567
Did you guys like the play?

35:22.602 --> 35:24.769
Oh, yes, this is
a very talented prison.

35:24.805 --> 35:26.437
I know.
It's amazing.

35:26.472 --> 35:28.973
And can you believe Kill Face
built all those sets himself?

35:29.009 --> 35:31.475
Daddy,
when are you coming home?

35:31.511 --> 35:34.879
I don't know, but it's...
it's gonna be a while.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.380
But hopefully soon.

35:38.784 --> 35:40.284
Hey.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.820
I saw some cupcakes
on the snack table.

35:42.855 --> 35:43.821
Go get us one.

35:45.592 --> 35:49.093
You really shouldn't get
his hopes up like that.

35:49.128 --> 35:50.294
I'm not.

35:50.330 --> 35:52.330
I'm still going to get you
out of here.

35:52.365 --> 35:56.233
In fact, I think Peri had a big
secret, and that's why...

35:56.268 --> 35:59.269
Rosie, can we please
not talk about Peri?

35:59.304 --> 36:03.473
I just want to enjoy my time
here with you and Tucker, okay?

36:03.508 --> 36:06.777
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry.
You're right.

36:06.812 --> 36:09.079
I've missed you so much.

36:15.787 --> 36:16.919
Where's our cupcake?

36:16.955 --> 36:18.154
They're all out.

36:18.189 --> 36:19.822
Ah.

36:21.693 --> 36:24.461
I wish Daddy could
come home with us.

36:24.496 --> 36:26.963
I'm working on it, <i>chiquito.</i>

36:29.400 --> 36:31.700
It's okay.
Close your eyes.

36:33.805 --> 36:35.304
We'll be home soon, huh?

36:45.032 --> 36:47.532
Shouldn't you be
on your way to New York?

36:47.568 --> 36:50.169
I was headed to the airport
and I made the driver stop.

36:50.204 --> 36:54.506
Look, I feel awful
about what happened.

36:54.541 --> 36:57.208
You humiliated me in front of
those horrible men.

36:57.244 --> 36:59.278
I'm so sorry.

36:59.313 --> 37:01.313
But how could I tell
the shareholders

37:01.348 --> 37:04.349
that I chose a novice
screenwriter over Hugh Metzger?

37:04.385 --> 37:06.885
I get that. I do.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.120
But you said that
you had my back.

37:09.156 --> 37:11.122
What can I do
to make things better?

37:11.158 --> 37:13.457
I don't want to leave
with this unresolved.

37:13.493 --> 37:15.193
Then stay.

37:15.228 --> 37:16.828
We're not gonna resolve this

37:16.863 --> 37:20.064
in the two minutes
while your car waits outside.

37:20.100 --> 37:21.732
Can't you go tomorrow?

37:21.768 --> 37:23.901
It's work.

37:23.936 --> 37:26.069
And work takes priority.
I'm starting to get that.

37:26.105 --> 37:27.471
Don't be that way.

37:27.507 --> 37:29.540
You know what?
It's good that you're going.

37:29.575 --> 37:31.542
I need some time.

37:33.179 --> 37:35.346
What does that mean for us?

37:35.381 --> 37:37.147
I don't know.

37:40.385 --> 37:42.152
Your driver's waiting.

37:52.597 --> 37:54.397
Thank you, my child.

37:54.433 --> 37:55.999
Have a blessed evening.

37:58.903 --> 38:00.603
Something wrong, James?

38:00.639 --> 38:02.339
I've been thinking.

38:02.374 --> 38:05.274
Me too. I believe I'm going
to have the soup tonight.

38:05.310 --> 38:07.877
It reminds me of the soup
kitchen where I volunteer

38:07.912 --> 38:10.547
when I'm not donating blood
or reading to the blind.

38:10.582 --> 38:11.514
We need to talk.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.515
Oh, God.

38:13.551 --> 38:15.218
Gosh...
I mean... Sorry.

38:15.253 --> 38:17.286
- Evelyn.
- It's all right.

38:18.923 --> 38:20.857
I know what
"We need to talk" means.

38:20.892 --> 38:22.992
- You do?
- You don't need to pretend.

38:23.028 --> 38:24.560
You're a better person
than I am.

38:24.595 --> 38:26.062
We both know it.

38:26.097 --> 38:27.329
If I were you, I wouldn't want
to be with me, either.

38:27.365 --> 38:28.364
Look, hold on.

38:28.399 --> 38:30.999
It's just...

38:31.035 --> 38:32.934
Your husband came by.

38:34.205 --> 38:39.205
He gave me this
so I'd stop seeing you.

38:40.978 --> 38:43.712
Ohh!

38:43.747 --> 38:45.947
Now, that's a lot of zeros.

38:45.983 --> 38:47.549
I could do some real good
with it.

38:50.754 --> 38:51.787
Of course you could.

38:51.822 --> 38:53.354
I can't accept it.

38:53.390 --> 38:55.190
What?

38:55.225 --> 38:57.793
It wasn't his money to give.
He took it from you.

38:57.828 --> 38:59.460
Now I'm giving it back.

38:59.496 --> 39:01.863
I-I don't know what to say.

39:01.899 --> 39:03.298
Just use that money

39:03.333 --> 39:05.066
to hire the best divorce
attorney you can find

39:05.101 --> 39:06.861
and get the hell
away from that man for good.

39:08.338 --> 39:10.471
So you're not breaking up
with me?

39:13.009 --> 39:15.577
My heart can't be bought.

39:16.913 --> 39:19.980
But lying to my husband...
Isn't that a tad bit immoral?

39:20.016 --> 39:22.482
Like I said before,

39:22.518 --> 39:24.251
I'm no saint.

39:28.624 --> 39:31.458
I did it.
I broke up with my mother.

39:31.493 --> 39:32.425
- What?
- Okay, yeah,

39:32.427 --> 39:33.961
I know how that sounds,

39:33.996 --> 39:35.762
but I stood up to her,
just like you said.

39:35.797 --> 39:37.231
Good for you.

39:37.266 --> 39:38.998
So can I stay here?

39:39.034 --> 39:40.267
With me?

39:40.302 --> 39:42.969
I don't have anywhere else
to go.

39:50.045 --> 39:51.445
Rosie, thank God.

39:51.480 --> 39:53.146
Are you okay?

39:53.181 --> 39:54.513
Where's Tucker?

39:54.549 --> 39:57.650
We're both fine.
Tucker's next door.

39:57.685 --> 40:00.453
They want to keep us overnight
for observation.

40:00.488 --> 40:03.656
I called Shannon.
She's on her way.

40:03.691 --> 40:05.191
Do you want me to tell Marisol
and the girls?

40:05.227 --> 40:07.460
No, I don't want to worry them.

40:07.495 --> 40:10.028
I just called the house so you
and Shannon would know.

40:10.064 --> 40:12.798
I-I can't believe
this happened.

40:12.833 --> 40:13.799
Who hit you?

40:13.834 --> 40:15.167
I didn't see.

40:15.202 --> 40:17.169
It was a hit-and-run.

40:17.204 --> 40:21.106
But, Jesse, I don't think
it was an accident.

40:21.142 --> 40:23.709
Oh, my God.
Someone hit you on purpose?

40:23.745 --> 40:26.711
It was a warning
from The Circle.

40:26.747 --> 40:29.214
They want me to stop looking
into Peri's murder.

40:32.853 --> 40:34.719
I must be getting close.

40:39.026 --> 40:41.459
Is everything all right,
Mother?

40:41.495 --> 40:44.329
Kyle and I had an argument.

40:44.364 --> 40:48.499
Well, maybe this
will make you happy.

40:48.534 --> 40:51.468
I don't think Rosie's gonna be
asking any more questions.

40:51.504 --> 40:54.071
I heard you ran her
off the road.

40:55.942 --> 40:59.410
Ben, are you aware that
Tucker Westmore was in the car?

40:59.445 --> 41:01.679
Is that a problem?

41:03.516 --> 41:05.549
It's a big problem.

41:05.584 --> 41:07.217
How could you be so reckless?

41:08.688 --> 41:09.753
I'm sorry.

41:12.358 --> 41:14.358
What's in this?

41:14.393 --> 41:17.728
Tucker Westmore
is the key to everything.

41:22.234 --> 41:24.935
I told you
not to disappoint me.
