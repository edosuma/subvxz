00:03.560 --> 00:05.720
Ever since waking up, I hear this voice.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.960
Here. I want you to have this.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.560
I put where I live at the bottom.

00:09.720 --> 00:13.440
You can come with me, you know.
I got my people and you got yours.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.480
He'll be dead before I even hit the...

00:17.780 --> 00:19.740
First, we get rid of the evidence.

00:19.860 --> 00:21.340
Jamie is divine, Dave.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.780
As his closest disciple,
I'm sure you know that.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.020
I'm going back to Slough.

00:27.140 --> 00:28.580
I don't know who we are any more.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:44.580 --> 00:48.340
See that? That's what's
going to kill everyone.

00:48.860 --> 00:50.380
Any second now.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.780
Yeah. It's Judgment Day.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.060
The actual Apocalypse.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.980
And where am I? In Slough.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.340
Or, rather, under Slough,

00:59.460 --> 01:01.020
watching it on telly.

01:01.140 --> 01:02.100
'One minute, now...

01:02.260 --> 01:04.459
these pictures coming
live to us from Hubble.'

01:04.580 --> 01:06.740
I know what you're thinking.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.980
"Cheer up, stop looking so miserable."

01:09.140 --> 01:11.180
But if these were your new housemates,

01:11.340 --> 01:14.020
you'd be feeling exactly the same way.

01:14.180 --> 01:17.260
It's time to brace
ourselves... to say goodbye.

01:38.780 --> 01:40.860
Everything is in hand,
and I mean everything...

01:40.980 --> 01:43.420
water, medicine, food.

01:43.580 --> 01:47.520
Your favourite, tuna chunks.
Welcome to your new home.

01:48.140 --> 01:49.660
Let's hope you never need it.

01:49.820 --> 01:56.940
This is wonderful. Above and
beyond the call of duty, Dr Samuel.

01:57.100 --> 01:59.860
Well, it is my job to
keep you alive, right?

02:00.020 --> 02:02.460
Now, would you like to see your room?

02:02.580 --> 02:05.100
Our room!

02:05.260 --> 02:09.180
You wouldn't want me
getting lonely, would you?

02:09.340 --> 02:10.979
Right. Yes...

02:11.140 --> 02:12.940
DOOR CLANKS Except for the blood,

02:13.060 --> 02:14.260
everything is in hand.

02:14.380 --> 02:15.980
Special delivery from Ameri...

02:16.100 --> 02:18.660
Fuck me. Sorry, are we interrupting?

02:18.780 --> 02:21.060
No. Show me.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.180
Funny-looking thing, isn't he?

02:27.340 --> 02:31.100
Still, it's what's on the
inside that counts, I suppose.

02:31.220 --> 02:34.100
Let's check his blood.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.620
What do we do if he's not clean?

02:39.740 --> 02:41.340
What do you think?

02:47.860 --> 02:51.020
Oh, yes! Welcome to Slough, home shit home!

02:57.020 --> 02:58.340
Good to be back, right?

03:00.340 --> 03:01.860
I'll take that as a "maybe".

03:16.340 --> 03:19.060
Jamie? Jamie, is that you?

03:20.620 --> 03:21.620
Argh!

03:21.740 --> 03:24.380
Oh, it is you! Oh, ho-ho!

03:24.500 --> 03:27.500
Oh, I have missed you so much.

03:27.620 --> 03:30.540
Come here! Oh...

03:30.660 --> 03:32.220
I missed you too, Mum.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.980
What are you doing here?

03:36.100 --> 03:37.460
Ah. Well. Um...

03:38.860 --> 03:42.720
It turns out that that wall
I knocked down was structural.

03:43.380 --> 03:45.900
You don't mind me staying here, do you?

03:47.780 --> 03:48.900
Jamie?

03:53.980 --> 03:55.540
What is it, love?

03:55.700 --> 03:58.060
- Um...
- What's happened with Layla?

03:59.260 --> 04:00.940
It seems she...

04:01.060 --> 04:02.540
Hey! All right, Paula?

04:02.660 --> 04:04.020
I've returned to resume

04:04.180 --> 04:06.980
our "will-they-won't-they" romantic tango.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.340
What's she doing here?

04:13.500 --> 04:15.940
- Um, is she not... ?
- I was just getting to that.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.579
Jamie's very upset. He needs his mother.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.060
Which one's mine?

04:41.300 --> 04:44.780
So... why aren't you looking for my mom?

04:44.940 --> 04:48.380
If it was vice-versa, she'd
be busting a gut for you.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.660
What do you want me to do? Try?

04:50.780 --> 04:53.620
But that'd take guts, I guess.

04:53.780 --> 04:56.300
You were too chicken shit to even come out.

04:56.460 --> 04:59.780
We're just very private people.
We don't all need to wave a flag.

04:59.940 --> 05:02.300
She's your twin. How do
you even sleep at night?

05:02.420 --> 05:03.580
Son of a...

05:03.740 --> 05:07.460
OK... are you going to go look for her?

05:17.580 --> 05:19.820
You know, he's right. How do I sleep?

05:19.980 --> 05:22.780
I... I don't... I haven't even...

05:26.220 --> 05:29.620
God, I feel like my
head is going to explode.

05:30.540 --> 05:31.580
I mean, look at us.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.300
Our own home and this is the only place

05:33.460 --> 05:35.020
where we can get any kind of privacy.

05:35.140 --> 05:36.380
Hey, I need you to calm down.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.340
How? Two days ago, I nearly killed a guy.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.020
- We don't even know where he is.
- OK, I'm on that.

05:43.540 --> 05:45.380
Who is this?

05:45.500 --> 05:48.220
- Who am I?
- Hey...

05:49.900 --> 05:51.420
Are you guys doing it?

05:51.580 --> 05:54.580
I need to drop a deuce.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.260
Can you hurry up? Please.

05:56.420 --> 05:58.740
Do you remember that chat we
had about starting a family?

05:58.860 --> 06:00.140
I'm so glad you won that.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.700
Come on! Hurry up!

06:07.300 --> 06:08.860
'I'm joined now by Professor Lot

06:09.020 --> 06:11.300
who's running the
controversial drug trials.

06:11.460 --> 06:14.300
Professor Lot, what's the
purpose, then, of this drug?'

06:14.460 --> 06:17.860
'Nocturnapram works on our
body's Vitamin D receptors.

06:18.020 --> 06:21.180
It'll enable us to live without
sunlight for up to two years,

06:21.340 --> 06:23.700
which, assuming we can
survive the initial impact,

06:23.860 --> 06:26.780
will help sustain human
life during the dust cloud.'

06:26.900 --> 06:29.580
'But come on... human guinea pigs?'

06:29.740 --> 06:32.380
'Look, the only way we can get
Nocturnapram to market in time

06:32.500 --> 06:34.020
is to go straight to human trial.'

06:34.140 --> 06:35.660
'This is Russian roulette, isn't it?

06:35.820 --> 06:37.500
I mean, people have died in your tests.'

06:37.620 --> 06:38.700
OK... thank you.

06:38.820 --> 06:40.100
'We simply don't have... '

06:40.260 --> 06:41.980
As if we weren't depressed enough already.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.860
What sort of muppet
signs up for a drug trial?

06:45.020 --> 06:47.100
There won't be enough to
go round when it's finished.

06:47.260 --> 06:49.980
If you volunteer, your family
goes to the front of the queue.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.900
Some people like the idea of
doing things for others, Paula.

06:53.060 --> 06:55.660
Said the woman who left
her son in a cardboard box.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.380
Mum, stop.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.260
- Well, I'm sorry, love...
- Oi!

06:59.380 --> 07:01.580
He said, "Mum".

07:01.700 --> 07:03.140
It's me he's telling off, not you.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.620
OK. I'm late.

07:08.220 --> 07:12.140
It says "Collect four tokens
and get a free skipping rope."

07:12.260 --> 07:15.940
Either of you... skip?

07:35.460 --> 07:38.060
Do you want to come inside? It's warmer.

07:45.300 --> 07:49.260
Husband's missing... since the comet.
I can't pay my mortgage this month.

07:50.420 --> 07:52.580
And I've been coming ever
day, but you've been shut.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.180
Let's have a look.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.060
It's all fine. It's been paid.

08:07.540 --> 08:08.540
But, um...

08:09.620 --> 08:11.060
It's been paid.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.780
One less thing to worry about, eh?

08:15.300 --> 08:19.040
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You don't know what that means.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.900
He helps the poor and needy,
for he is the resurrection

08:25.020 --> 08:26.180
and he is the light.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.740
Everyone should kneel down

08:27.860 --> 08:29.540
and beg for his infinite grace.

08:29.660 --> 08:30.780
Hello.

08:31.940 --> 08:34.500
I... I brought you some sandwiches.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.980
That's really kind of you.

08:37.140 --> 08:41.600
Mary... I need you to not do
the whole Son of God thing here.

08:43.659 --> 08:45.100
What if we do it outside?

08:46.340 --> 08:47.620
Yeah.

08:47.780 --> 08:50.860
- That could work.
- I'll go spread the word.

08:51.020 --> 08:53.340
- Want a cup of tea?
- Yeah, lovely.

08:56.020 --> 08:56.980
Ah, here you are.

08:58.140 --> 09:00.420
I made you some peanut butter sandwich...

09:01.620 --> 09:03.140
Listen, people of Slough...

09:03.300 --> 09:07.480
- I see someone else got in before me.
- Mum, it's not a competition.

09:08.540 --> 09:11.300
For the record, you make better sandwiches.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.460
Don't you forget it.

09:14.660 --> 09:16.460
The Son of God walks amongst...

09:16.580 --> 09:19.580
Jamie, why are you bothering?

09:19.700 --> 09:21.020
Cos I'm a bank manager.

09:21.180 --> 09:25.680
I mean, what else of me is left?
At least here, I know where I am.

09:26.940 --> 09:30.000
Look... don't take this the wrong way,

09:31.220 --> 09:33.380
but maybe this Layla thing...

09:33.500 --> 09:35.380
Maybe it's for the best.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.900
I mean, at least now you can move on.

09:38.020 --> 09:41.420
Well, let's hope you're right...

09:41.580 --> 09:43.900
cos at the moment, it's
like I'm cursed or something.

09:44.020 --> 09:46.420
Jamie. Don't be ridiculous.

09:48.540 --> 09:50.580
Mary?

09:50.700 --> 09:51.780
Mary!

09:59.060 --> 10:01.580
Mary? Can you hear me?

10:06.604 --> 10:08.484
'Jamie is the son of God.

10:08.644 --> 10:12.404
He will lead his people
to the land of freedom... '

10:14.884 --> 10:16.084
Oh!

10:16.204 --> 10:18.004
Oh-ho-ho!

10:18.124 --> 10:19.244
Ooh!

10:19.364 --> 10:21.204
'Jamie, he is the son of God.

10:21.364 --> 10:23.804
He will lead his people
to the land of freedom.'

10:23.924 --> 10:24.924
OK, let's do this.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.244
'... the son of God. He will lead
his people to the land of freedom.'

10:40.304 --> 10:43.044
Jude, come on, we are late. We
will need to get to the airport.

10:44.924 --> 10:47.444
I think we're going to
have to take a later flight.

10:47.604 --> 10:51.184
'Jamie, he is the son of
God, he will lead his people

10:51.804 --> 10:53.964
to the land of freedom.'

11:06.044 --> 11:09.884
It was bad luck. Could have been
me, it could have been anybody.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.604
If I had just left her where she was...

11:11.724 --> 11:12.924
No, no, no, no.

11:13.044 --> 11:14.324
You did the right thing.

11:14.444 --> 11:16.324
That hospital was a disgrace.

11:16.484 --> 11:19.044
They're laughing at her
dying like it's a cartoon.

11:19.204 --> 11:21.484
Yeah, but, you know, don't
take it so personally.

11:21.644 --> 11:24.404
- Now everyone's dying, I think it's OK to laugh at death.
- Yeah.

11:24.564 --> 11:27.084
You know, it's like,
"Up yours, Grim Reaper!"

11:27.204 --> 11:29.204
"You big dick!"

11:29.364 --> 11:31.644
At least she gets a fuss made of her.

11:31.764 --> 11:33.724
I mean, the rest of us won't.

11:33.884 --> 11:36.724
Yeah, we really pulled out
all the stops, didn't we?

11:36.844 --> 11:38.244
Oi, oi.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.804
Who ordered the strippers?

11:44.444 --> 11:46.904
Well, hello, my future husband!

11:52.934 --> 11:56.654
Excuse me. Is this the
funeral for Mary Conroy?

11:57.374 --> 11:59.494
What passed for it, yeah.

11:59.614 --> 12:01.774
You must be her son?

12:01.934 --> 12:04.654
I'm sorry for your loss. I saw the clip.

12:04.814 --> 12:06.894
OK, if this is about
that Second Coming crap,

12:07.014 --> 12:08.854
you picked a bad time.

12:09.014 --> 12:11.614
I hate to disappoint you,
but I'm not the son of God.

12:11.734 --> 12:13.854
I know.

12:14.314 --> 12:18.034
You see, the thing is,
I think you're my son.

12:19.154 --> 12:20.674
Jamie, I'm Father Jude.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.674
Your father, Jude.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.475
_

13:18.034 --> 13:20.354
'You've reached Rhonda, Rajesh and Spike.

13:20.514 --> 13:22.434
Leave us a message.'

13:22.554 --> 13:24.834
'Do you want to make a difference?

13:24.954 --> 13:26.514
Help save lives?

13:26.674 --> 13:29.394
Maybe even change the course of history?

13:29.554 --> 13:32.514
At Knott Counterplan, we're
working around the clock

13:32.674 --> 13:36.074
to craft solutions for
a post-apocalyptic world.

13:36.194 --> 13:38.114
So volunteer for the trials.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.274
There's this amazing new drug... '

13:54.954 --> 13:56.234
Where am I?

14:05.594 --> 14:07.394
Who are you?

14:07.514 --> 14:10.754
You ever think about dying, Ariel?

14:10.874 --> 14:13.954
I think about it all the time.

14:14.074 --> 14:16.354
Scares the crap outta me.

14:16.474 --> 14:17.954
I hate being old.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.314
Where are we?

14:19.434 --> 14:21.434
In a bunker underneath my estate.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.154
If the comet hits, we could
live down here for years

14:24.274 --> 14:26.274
so long as we've got what we need.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.714
And what I need is... this stuff!

14:32.114 --> 14:33.394
You want my blood?

14:33.514 --> 14:35.634
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

14:35.794 --> 14:38.034
I need to find out you're clean first.

14:38.154 --> 14:39.394
What if I'm not clean?

14:42.514 --> 14:43.754
Ah, he's awake.

14:44.834 --> 14:46.194
Everything OK?

14:46.354 --> 14:49.994
- Let's get some food in him.
- Actually, I'm not very hungry.

14:50.114 --> 14:51.354
Look at him!

14:51.474 --> 14:52.874
He's like a stick!

14:53.034 --> 14:55.354
Get the kitchen to make
him a steak, will ya?

14:55.474 --> 14:56.914
Get some iron in him.

14:57.034 --> 14:58.714
Good for the old blood!

14:58.834 --> 15:00.634
You should have one, too, Doctor.

15:00.754 --> 15:02.874
Need to keep your strength up!

15:02.994 --> 15:03.994
Don't we?!

15:04.154 --> 15:06.154
Yes!

15:08.714 --> 15:11.674
That boy's in wa-ay out of his depth.

15:11.794 --> 15:13.714
I like that, Ariel.

15:13.874 --> 15:16.954
They're sexy when they're a little scared.

15:17.114 --> 15:19.914
Is that what you're doing
with me? Is this a sex thing?

15:20.074 --> 15:23.474
For heaven's sake, don't be disgusting!

15:24.394 --> 15:26.034
I'm your grandmother!

15:27.514 --> 15:28.874
Pardon?!

15:53.354 --> 15:55.314
Someone's smashed the back door in.

15:55.434 --> 15:57.474
You think we should call the cops?

15:57.594 --> 15:58.634
Kerry? Eddie?

15:58.874 --> 16:01.114
Oh, no, it's OK, it's me!

16:01.274 --> 16:03.434
Stay there, Rhonda! Don't come any closer!

16:03.554 --> 16:05.714
Kerry, call 911.

16:05.874 --> 16:07.874
No, no, no, you don't
have to do that! It's me!

16:08.034 --> 16:10.634
Stay the hell away from us.
You don't belong here any more.

16:10.754 --> 16:12.274
This is my home.

16:12.394 --> 16:14.754
Hello? Police department?

16:14.874 --> 16:17.394
Go after her, Eddie!

16:17.514 --> 16:19.114
'Hello? Police department.'

16:19.274 --> 16:23.194
'Yes, yes, we're on 452 Willow Drive.

16:23.314 --> 16:26.194
I've just seen Rhonda McNeil.'

16:26.354 --> 16:29.074
Can't let his Johnson run
the meeting and we can't,

16:29.234 --> 16:32.594
can't let him turn Mount Genesis
into his own personal harem, OK?

16:32.754 --> 16:35.034
Stick together, present a united front.

16:35.194 --> 16:36.834
Scotty, I mean it.

16:36.994 --> 16:39.034
I need your head in the
game. I can't do this alone.

16:39.194 --> 16:41.714
I know, I got this. Just
give me a second, OK?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.074
Spike, not now!

16:43.194 --> 16:44.194
- My mom's in DC.
- What?!

16:45.674 --> 16:47.394
She went home, the neighbours called 911,

16:47.554 --> 16:50.114
they said she ran off north and
that's where the cops are looking

16:50.274 --> 16:51.674
but I think she's gone to the school.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.034
She always heads north then
turns right at the woods.

16:54.194 --> 16:56.634
- Spike, I can't help.
- 'Scotty, you have to.'

16:56.794 --> 16:58.834
- 'She needs us.'
- No, no, listen.

16:58.954 --> 17:00.394
I can't get involved!

17:00.514 --> 17:02.474
Oh, my God! You piece of... !

17:09.233 --> 17:10.554
My apologies, sir.

17:10.674 --> 17:12.954
I thought it better to meet here.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.034
No official record.

17:15.154 --> 17:17.513
Unlike the Oval.

17:17.634 --> 17:19.554
I read your dossier.

17:19.674 --> 17:20.914
Just checking...

17:21.034 --> 17:22.993
none of them know, right?

17:23.154 --> 17:25.634
- I mean, this is still containable.
- Absolutely.

17:25.794 --> 17:26.632
We met the women...

17:26.635 --> 17:30.314
... under the pretence of
a Nasa recruitment drive.

17:30.474 --> 17:34.374
We told them that Operation
Saviour had re-ignited interest

17:35.394 --> 17:36.434
in the space programme.

17:36.594 --> 17:39.634
This then allowed us to
perform thorough medical tests

17:39.754 --> 17:41.434
without arousing suspicion.

17:41.554 --> 17:42.954
Including their fertility?

17:43.074 --> 17:45.074
That was more problematic.

17:45.234 --> 17:47.514
We ended up spiking their drinks one night.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.514
Don't tell me, I don't want to know.

17:53.495 --> 17:56.091
_

17:56.274 --> 17:58.994
Still, needs must, hmm?

17:59.114 --> 18:00.394
Now.

18:00.554 --> 18:04.714
I was wondering whether
we shouldn't venture...

18:04.834 --> 18:07.114
Yeah. Bring her in instead.

18:19.434 --> 18:23.154
Oh, sir, this is our embryologist.
We need her, right, Scotty?

18:23.674 --> 18:25.114
General Gaines.

18:26.674 --> 18:28.074
This isn't a request.

18:30.454 --> 18:31.614
This is weird for you.

18:33.134 --> 18:34.094
Yeah.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.014
Well, we have one thing in common.

18:37.934 --> 18:41.854
So I think that maybe I should
just start at the beginning.

18:42.374 --> 18:44.054
I was 18.

18:44.174 --> 18:46.094
Living over here.

18:46.254 --> 18:48.854
I had just been kicked out of school.

18:48.974 --> 18:51.094
I was... really going off the rails.

18:54.214 --> 18:55.814
And that's when I met Mary.

18:58.974 --> 19:02.334
We'd only been together a
month, and she got pregnant.

19:04.974 --> 19:06.614
And I panicked.

19:06.774 --> 19:09.874
I mean, the thought of
starting a family. I was...

19:10.894 --> 19:13.534
I was 18.

19:13.654 --> 19:14.734
I barely knew her.

19:18.334 --> 19:19.934
So I asked her to...

19:23.174 --> 19:25.574
... terminate the pregnancy.

19:27.694 --> 19:30.014
She said no.

19:30.134 --> 19:31.894
And so I left.

19:32.014 --> 19:34.814
I never even said goodbye.

19:34.934 --> 19:38.534
Ah, here we go!

19:38.654 --> 19:41.694
Aw, this is nice, isn't it?

19:41.854 --> 19:45.494
Everyone getting to know each
other. And we've got biscuits.

19:47.014 --> 19:49.734
Go on, Father. Have a finger.

19:52.014 --> 19:53.574
Oh! DAVE LAUGHS

19:53.734 --> 19:57.254
Sorry. I've given you my cup by mistake.

19:57.374 --> 19:59.254
That's embarrassing.

19:59.414 --> 20:03.134
Sorry, did we interrupt? You carry on.

20:05.254 --> 20:09.674
I told you I don't come
out of this well. But...

20:10.334 --> 20:12.734
I was such a mess then. You
were better off without me.

20:12.894 --> 20:17.254
- Oh, so walking out was really an act of kindness?
- No, it was cowardice.

20:18.774 --> 20:22.014
I was just saying that maybe
there was an upside for you.

20:23.814 --> 20:25.574
Is that why you're here now?

20:25.734 --> 20:27.414
I wanted to pay our respects to Mary,

20:27.534 --> 20:30.574
but mostly I wanted to meet you.

20:30.694 --> 20:32.294
And ask for your forgiveness.

20:37.134 --> 20:39.734
Was she mad when you knew her?

20:39.854 --> 20:42.174
Was she hearing voices?

20:44.174 --> 20:46.748
- No.
- Cos by the time she gave birth,

20:46.749 --> 20:48.680
God was chatting away to her.

20:50.054 --> 20:53.174
Told her to dump me in
a car park, so she did,

20:53.294 --> 20:55.734
just like you abandoned her.

20:55.854 --> 20:58.614
Maybe because you abandoned her.

20:58.774 --> 21:02.714
- Jamie, I am so sorry. I had no idea.
- There's your little legacy.

21:03.574 --> 21:05.094
Thanks, Dad.

21:05.214 --> 21:07.934
And now, you want forgiveness

21:08.054 --> 21:11.374
to make yourself feel better.

21:11.494 --> 21:13.654
Well, I'm sorry, no.

21:13.774 --> 21:15.894
You ruined her life,

21:16.014 --> 21:19.134
and you are not forgiven.

22:29.494 --> 22:30.974
I love you too, Mom.

22:32.814 --> 22:34.374
What?

22:34.494 --> 22:37.454
Oh, my God. Is that... ?

22:39.774 --> 22:41.094
Oh!

22:41.254 --> 22:44.694
- Oh, your nose! Your nose. Oh, baby.
- Huh?

22:44.814 --> 22:46.374
- Oh, baby!
- Mom, Mom, Mom.

22:46.494 --> 22:48.654
You smell really bad.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.494
I know, I know.

22:52.654 --> 22:54.734
But you're just going
to have to deal with it,

22:54.854 --> 22:56.534
because I'm not letting you go.

23:01.920 --> 23:06.100
Aww. That's him dressed as a mutant turtle.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.120
He was obsessed with them.

23:09.280 --> 23:12.160
Oh, and that was just after
he wet himself at Thorpe Park.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.000
- This is when we all went...
- Paula, thank you.

23:16.160 --> 23:19.940
This has been so lovely, but I
think we should probably be going.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.760
Oh, no, don't go!

23:22.880 --> 23:24.880
He'll be back in a bit.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.880
He doesn't want me here. And having
walked out on him once before,

23:29.040 --> 23:31.840
I don't have much right
to walk back in uninvited.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.200
I would have been a terrible father.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.840
And when I look at those
photos, I see how happy he was.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.560
That's cos of you, Paula.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.640
You were able to give him
a life I never could have.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.240
I don't know the first thing
about what a happy family is.

23:46.400 --> 23:50.320
Mine was all yelling and whiskey
glasses flying through the air.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.000
Jude, shut up.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.800
What is this?

23:53.920 --> 23:55.480
That's Jamie's.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.640
He threw it away. It's,
er... It's complicated.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.000
It's her, from Poland. Is he...

24:01.120 --> 24:03.040
Is he married to this woman?

24:04.640 --> 24:08.540
The little girl, she told me
her father worked in a bank.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.760
- Holy shit.
- What are you two on about?

24:11.880 --> 24:13.960
Paula, I think Jamie has a daughter.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.040
Shitting hell.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.160
It's his bloody voicemail again.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.440
Jamie, call me, yeah? It's urgent.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.640
Are you absolutely sure about this?

24:57.760 --> 24:59.480
Cos he's been through a lot lately.

24:59.640 --> 25:03.001
The dates work. And the girl
said her father works in a bank.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.002
Right.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.760
We'll check the bank and the
bowling alley. You do the pubs.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.200
Father, you come with me.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.680
M'lady, your carriage awaits.

25:16.800 --> 25:17.720
Oh.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.960
Where have you been living?

25:25.120 --> 25:28.560
With Uncle Scotty. And his boyfriend.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.593
How long has Scotty had a boyfriend?

25:30.594 --> 25:33.700
- Four years.
- Four years?

25:34.640 --> 25:38.380
- How come he never told us? Is he happy?
- Who cares?

25:39.040 --> 25:42.240
- You get he doesn't give a shit about you, right?
- Hey.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.800
Yes, he does. Don't say that.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.320
He totally abandoned you.
Why do you stick up for him?

25:48.480 --> 25:51.880
Because growing up he was all I had.
We've always looked after each other.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.560
Well, he's not doing that any more.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.640
Oh, no. Run!

25:58.320 --> 26:01.480
OK, I want every exit sealed,
but check the library first.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.440
You ever meet your father?

26:09.560 --> 26:11.680
You don't look like him.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.960
He's a beautiful man.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.680
Thank you for your kind words.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.640
Shame he didn't have more kids
before he retired from all that.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.520
Instead all I get is you.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.000
What?

26:27.520 --> 26:29.560
Nothing.

26:29.720 --> 26:32.800
Just, you know, if you need your
family's blood, you could ask.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.480
My kids wouldn't help.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.080
They hate me.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.080
I don't blame them. I was a lousy mother.

26:39.240 --> 26:43.080
That whole maternal
instinct thing isn't very me.

26:44.440 --> 26:47.780
Gerbils eat their babies. I can empathise.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.700
Plus, it's complicated, what
with me being dead and everything.

26:53.760 --> 26:57.440
I had a few legal issues back in the '80s.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.118
I was innocent, of course.

26:59.119 --> 27:00.419
- Of course.
- Of course.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.960
But I had to disappear.

27:03.120 --> 27:06.780
The point is, I can't risk being found now.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.840
Can't risk my kids snitching on me.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.660
Don't think I'd exactly thrive
in a correctional institution.

27:16.520 --> 27:20.280
But if Saviour fails then it all changes.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.480
They'll need my bunker.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.480
OK, that's it. He's done.

27:29.120 --> 27:32.400
Grandma, I know what
it's like to disappear.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.080
I spent years making myself invisible.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.920
I don't understand how you found me.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.240
We didn't find you. You found us.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.920
We were following your uncle Scotty.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.640
Hang on. You mean Scotty
McNeil is my uncle?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.360
- Anything?
- Library's clear.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.560
Can't win here, Rhonda.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.480
What?

28:28.520 --> 28:30.480
Whereabouts?

28:30.600 --> 28:31.920
And this is genuine?

28:33.600 --> 28:37.000
911 just got a call. McNeil
carjacked someone at a drive-through

28:37.160 --> 28:40.440
three miles from here. We all
moving out. Let's go. Let's go!

28:53.440 --> 28:54.680
We're good.

28:57.440 --> 29:01.160
- What the hell just happened?
- No idea.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.400
Let's make the most of it.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.960
Psst!

29:09.200 --> 29:10.880
- What was that?
- I don't know.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.840
I'm in 403.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.720
- Scotty?! What the hell?
- Did they buy it?

29:33.320 --> 29:36.240
That call was you? How the
hell did you get in there?

29:36.400 --> 29:39.440
I spent pretty much all of 6th
to 10th grade stuffed in lockers.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.760
Turns out it's kind of like riding a bike.

29:41.920 --> 29:45.400
Also turns out I'm a bit fatter
than I was. Can I get a little help?

29:47.120 --> 29:49.760
Yup... OK. All right.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.320
So I guess this is when you
tell me I'm a terrible brother?

30:06.200 --> 30:08.040
Well, you're here now.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.160
Come here.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.720
I love you.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.960
- Big loser!
- I love you, t... Oh, wow.

30:15.120 --> 30:18.120
Wow, you smell like a skunk
whose wife just left it.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.560
Oh, yeah, OK, don't push
your luck, all right?

30:20.720 --> 30:22.800
There are smaller lockers over there.

30:25.160 --> 30:26.560
Come on.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.200
Why are you volunteering, Jamie?

30:33.320 --> 30:34.840
Um...

30:34.960 --> 30:36.640
It's complicated.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.560
I'd like to think I could still
make a difference, I guess.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.000
I don't really feel
like I've achieved much.

30:49.320 --> 30:52.360
Wasted years waiting for my wife.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.320
And then it turned out she
was married to my brother.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.760
And what else? My mum
lied to me for 30 years.

31:01.520 --> 31:05.040
My other mum thought I was the son of God,

31:05.200 --> 31:08.760
and in return God dumped
a tonne of bricks on her.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.440
Dug her grave this morning.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.640
And then my dad showed up
for the first time in my life,

31:15.760 --> 31:19.520
and I was just so angry with him.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.720
But...

31:22.840 --> 31:25.680
really, I'm angry with myself.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.760
Because I've wasted my life.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.760
Yeah, that just about covers it.

31:37.320 --> 31:40.760
OK, I'm just going to check
the "wants to help others" box.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.760
And I see you've nominated
your mum and your friend Dave

31:44.920 --> 31:48.360
to receive Nocturnapram in
the event that the comet hits.

31:48.560 --> 31:51.840
- Yeah.
- Good. They'll be notified immediately.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.120
Now, I'm legally obliged to
inform you that there are risks

31:55.280 --> 31:57.520
associated with what you're about to do.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.160
Side effects can include
vomiting, internal bleeding,

32:00.320 --> 32:03.080
paralysis of the thumbs,
depression, breathing difficulties,

32:03.240 --> 32:05.880
hair loss, heart palpitations,
death, and in some cases,

32:06.000 --> 32:07.760
erectile dysfunction.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.120
So are you sure you want to do this, Jamie?

32:10.240 --> 32:12.760
Yes. Absolutely.

32:15.825 --> 32:17.625
Get out of the way, you stupid prat!

32:17.785 --> 32:20.385
Maybe a few deep breaths would be good.

32:20.545 --> 32:24.065
It's not like Jamie. He wouldn't
just disappear like that.

32:26.385 --> 32:29.225
Check that for me, will you,
Father? Just in case it's him.

32:29.385 --> 32:32.265
"Congratulations, you've been nominated

32:32.425 --> 32:34.545
to receive a course in Nocturnapram."

32:36.185 --> 32:38.305
Shit!

32:38.465 --> 32:41.105
Twice! Unbelievable!

32:41.225 --> 32:43.305
Get out of the way, you prat!

32:49.006 --> 32:51.090
_

32:51.745 --> 32:53.305
Four years.

32:54.785 --> 32:56.905
For years you guys have been together,

32:57.025 --> 32:59.345
and you never introduced me.

32:59.465 --> 33:02.425
You're ashamed of me, is that it?

33:02.545 --> 33:05.105
No, no, we're just...

33:05.225 --> 33:07.105
We're just private people.

33:07.225 --> 33:09.985
Well, when did that happen?

33:10.145 --> 33:13.705
When did we stop telling each other stuff?

33:14.905 --> 33:18.545
You're my only family, Scotty, and if...

33:18.705 --> 33:22.565
When all this calms down, I
want you to introduce me to him,

33:23.425 --> 33:25.985
and I want to tell him
embarrassing stories about you,

33:26.105 --> 33:29.225
because that's what family does. OK?

33:30.345 --> 33:32.225
- Car.
- What?

33:33.705 --> 33:35.465
I thought you said no-one ever comes here!

33:35.625 --> 33:37.385
They don't, that's why we bought the place.

33:37.505 --> 33:39.265
No, it's OK. It's OK.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.705
It's OK. Um...

33:43.305 --> 33:44.505
I'll handle it.

33:59.145 --> 34:01.105
You must be Rhonda.

34:01.225 --> 34:03.145
You must be Arnold.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.505
Scotty, a word.

34:09.905 --> 34:10.985
Excuse us.

34:11.215 --> 34:14.135
- It's nice to finally meet you.
- Likewise.

34:19.975 --> 34:23.375
I've been out there, fighting for our plan.

34:23.534 --> 34:27.135
Trying to stop the whole thing from
turning to shit. And where were you?

34:27.255 --> 34:28.895
- I was helping my sister.
- Yeah.

34:29.054 --> 34:30.975
OK, yeah, and you know what? It felt great.

34:31.094 --> 34:33.135
For the first time in a long time,

34:33.295 --> 34:35.775
I did something that actually
made me feel OK about myself.

34:35.895 --> 34:37.455
She has always had my back,

34:37.614 --> 34:40.415
and I am disgusted with
myself that I abandoned her.

34:45.135 --> 34:46.975
So how'd you get her out?

34:49.534 --> 34:50.975
Faked a 911.

34:52.815 --> 34:55.695
Please tell me you
didn't use your own phone.

35:00.215 --> 35:01.335
Scotty.

35:05.135 --> 35:08.895
- Now all they got to do is trace the call.
- Yeah.

35:12.455 --> 35:16.075
OK, I'll do my best to protect you,

35:16.935 --> 35:20.775
- but we can't afford to both be sucked into this.
- Wait, wh...

35:22.935 --> 35:25.655
One of us has got to be there
to see the bunker through.

35:25.815 --> 35:28.695
- What are you saying?
- I need plausible deniability.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.880
I'll be under suspicion
if they know I'm with you.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.080
So I'll move my stuff into a hotel.

35:37.240 --> 35:39.640
- Arnie, Arnie, this is ridiculous.
- Is it?

35:39.800 --> 35:42.520
I don't think you've left
us with any other option.

35:45.560 --> 35:49.360
They think she's a terrorist.
We can't both be accessories.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.760
One of us has to keep
his security clearances.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.400
You've made your choice.

36:00.320 --> 36:01.640
I love you.

36:06.600 --> 36:09.080
I love you, too.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.920
But right now, who cares?

36:13.960 --> 36:15.880
This is bigger than us.

36:51.040 --> 36:53.800
'So you had me spring my own aunt from jail

36:53.920 --> 36:55.600
without even realising.'

36:56.880 --> 36:58.960
Very funny, God.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.760
Very funny.

37:03.080 --> 37:06.800
I haven't worked it out yet, but
you are up to something, aren't you?

37:08.320 --> 37:09.920
Playing a game.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.720
Giving me a taste of my own medicine.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.280
That dream I had about freeing Rhonda,

37:17.400 --> 37:20.000
didn't understand it, did I?

37:20.160 --> 37:23.560
Thought it was about the NSA,
but did you have other plans?

37:25.240 --> 37:26.880
Maybe Max was right.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.920
Have you chosen me, God?

37:31.040 --> 37:32.920
Am I your vessel?

37:35.160 --> 37:39.000
Is it even God I'm speaking
to, or the other guy?

37:40.640 --> 37:44.520
Well, whatever. Get me
out of this, I'm all yours.

37:45.640 --> 37:48.520
You want me to go Old Testament,

37:48.640 --> 37:51.400
I'll go Old Testament.

38:05.840 --> 38:06.880
Excuse me...

38:17.040 --> 38:20.440
My boy is in there, and I'm getting him.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.880
Not without an appointment, love. Sorry.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.320
Oh, I see.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.920
You want a tumble, do you?
Is that what you're after?

38:29.040 --> 38:30.480
Come on, then!

38:34.640 --> 38:36.560
Get off!

38:41.280 --> 38:42.720
Get off!

38:53.560 --> 38:56.520
Jamie! Wait!

38:56.680 --> 38:59.080
- Don't go in there.
- Jamie. Jamie, please. We're very busy.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.880
Jamie, you have a daughter.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.600
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- We met Layla a few days ago.

39:10.760 --> 39:14.400
- And I know that it's complicated between you.
- Yeah, just a bit.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.560
I wonder who the father is.
Thanks for depressing me even more.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.480
The little girl, she drew this.

39:19.640 --> 39:23.200
She said this is her father,
that he works in a bank.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.280
She drew you.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.440
And look, she wrote where
she lives. You can find her.

39:30.480 --> 39:34.040
- I can't handle this right now.
- Jamie, I understand.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.560
You hate me because I ran away.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.840
How is going in that room any different?

39:39.960 --> 39:42.000
Is that what you want?

39:42.120 --> 39:43.560
To be like me?

39:56.320 --> 39:58.200
Jamie!

40:00.720 --> 40:01.880
Jamie!

40:07.240 --> 40:11.200
Jamie, get down here right now.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.160
I said right now, young man.

40:17.760 --> 40:21.160
Right, I'll count to three. One, two...

40:21.280 --> 40:23.160
Mum, I'm 30 years old.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.720
I'm doing the talking now, sunshine.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.480
What the hell do you think you're doing?

40:29.640 --> 40:33.320
Do you think I want some drug to survive?

40:35.320 --> 40:38.680
Do you think I even want
to survive without you?

40:41.520 --> 40:43.760
You're loved, Jamie.

40:44.920 --> 40:48.280
I want you to feel how I feel.

40:50.520 --> 40:55.120
If there's a chance that this girl
is yours, then you go and find her.

40:58.040 --> 41:01.800
You put all this Layla crap behind you,

41:01.920 --> 41:04.640
and you jump in with both feet.

41:06.920 --> 41:10.680
And you pour every part of you

41:11.200 --> 41:13.480
into being her dad.

41:13.600 --> 41:17.880
Your time, your energy, your love.

41:20.200 --> 41:24.040
You pour it all in until you
don't even know where you end

41:24.560 --> 41:26.160
and she begins.

41:29.600 --> 41:32.520
And you hope that'll be enough.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.640
That they'll be happy.

41:37.520 --> 41:40.680
And that you never, ever

41:40.840 --> 41:44.400
have to see your daughter
in a place like this.

41:50.760 --> 41:52.400
Now.

41:53.560 --> 41:56.000
Got fish fingers for tea.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.960
Are you coming or what?

42:13.840 --> 42:16.320
Back to the Vatican, then.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.480
Yeah.

42:18.640 --> 42:21.920
Dave said he'd give us
a ride to the airport.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.960
Um...

42:24.080 --> 42:26.240
And I was thinking after the comet...

42:26.360 --> 42:29.120
if there is an after... I could...

42:29.240 --> 42:31.400
I haven't seen Rome.

42:31.520 --> 42:35.000
You should come. It's...

42:35.160 --> 42:39.040
It's very beautiful, and
full of history, and...

42:41.000 --> 42:42.960
I'd love to show you around.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.720
And vice versa,

42:44.880 --> 42:47.320
obviously, if you want
to come back to Slough,

42:47.480 --> 42:50.360
cos you've barely scratched
the surface here, so...

42:59.520 --> 43:01.280
Jamie.

43:01.400 --> 43:03.000
What are you going to do?

43:04.960 --> 43:07.760
I think I'm going to find my daughter.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.280
See what this whole dad thing is about.

43:23.760 --> 43:27.480
- I'm guessing my results came back.
- Hepatitis, I'm afraid.

43:27.640 --> 43:31.040
- You've come to kill me, haven't you?
- I think that'd be a mistake.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.120
Well, of course you do.

43:33.280 --> 43:35.960
But then again, you are a
little biased, aren't you?

43:38.120 --> 43:39.320
Go on.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.480
I'm just like you, Grandma.

43:42.880 --> 43:45.160
We could do great things together.

43:45.320 --> 43:48.200
Plus, if you kill me, you'll
never know what I know.

43:48.320 --> 43:51.360
Our family is bigger than you think.

43:52.840 --> 43:54.240
Explain.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.520
- Maybe Jude has another child.
- Bullshit.

43:59.680 --> 44:02.120
- I'd know.
- Not if they were abandoned as a baby.

44:02.240 --> 44:05.040
And what if he or she has a child?

44:06.640 --> 44:08.800
Your great-granddaughter.

44:08.920 --> 44:10.800
Six years old.

44:10.920 --> 44:13.760
Imagine how clean that blood is.

44:13.880 --> 44:16.920
What's her name, and where is she?

44:18.440 --> 44:22.200
Why would I tell you that
without something in return?

44:22.360 --> 44:25.240
We both want to survive,
so let's make a deal.

44:25.400 --> 44:28.960
You let me go, save me a place in here,

44:29.880 --> 44:32.240
and I'll get the girl.

44:32.360 --> 44:35.560
A living, breathing blood bank.

44:35.680 --> 44:36.800
Deal?

44:36.920 --> 44:37.840
Deal!

44:40.560 --> 44:43.840
I have to get a message to General Gaines

44:43.960 --> 44:45.320
or we're all screwed.

44:45.480 --> 44:49.620
Believe me, marriage is the only
path to happiness and salvation.

44:52.160 --> 44:55.400
- Who's this?
- My husband, Your Honour.
