Season07 Episode10

00:15.960 --> 00:20.070
Madam President, we have your husband, but
he sustained a gunshot wound to the chest.

00:20.110 --> 00:22.060
Is my husband going to be okay?

00:22.100 --> 00:24.180
We're not going to know anything
until the doctors see him.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.370
Since your husband was the only
leverage that Dubaku had left,

00:26.410 --> 00:28.510
it's safe to say that he's
trying to leave the country now.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.110
Whatever we're going to do to find
him, we're going to have to do it fast.

00:31.150 --> 00:34.490
Whatever it takes, I want
that son of a bitch found!

00:34.530 --> 00:38.200
Have someone find my daughter,
Olivia, and bring her to me.

00:38.240 --> 00:42.340
What is it that's so important for my mother to
steal me away while I'm trying to do business?

00:42.380 --> 00:44.580
It's your father. He's been shot.

00:44.590 --> 00:46.880
My, God, I…

00:46.900 --> 00:49.870
do you think I'm a fool, Mr Burnett?

00:49.880 --> 00:52.270
If anything should happen to
me on my way out of the country,

00:52.310 --> 00:55.260
a data file with all the names and
bank transactions of all those involved

00:55.300 --> 00:57.760
will be sent to the justice department.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.760
You told me that once Dubaku served
his purpose, you'd take him out.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.250
Why are we still helping him?

01:03.290 --> 01:07.730
He's threatening to expose
us using a database he's
kept with names and accounts
of everyone involved.

01:07.770 --> 01:08.920
Including mine?

01:08.940 --> 01:11.780
We don't know where the file is, so
you just better pray that he gets away.

01:11.820 --> 01:13.310
I'm begging you, Marika…

01:13.350 --> 01:16.170
–FBI! Don't move!
–Get on your knees! Now!

01:16.180 --> 01:18.420
–Where is Dubaku?
–Who?

01:18.430 --> 01:20.680
Don't play games with me! Ike Dubaku!

01:20.720 --> 01:21.780
You know this man?

01:21.820 --> 01:23.870
She was going to meet him.

01:23.890 --> 01:26.120
When the car arrives, we would
like you to go with the driver,

01:26.160 --> 01:28.190
so that we could follow
you back to Dubaku.

01:28.230 --> 01:30.260
You want her to go to him and face him?

01:30.300 --> 01:33.390
It's the only chance we have of finding
him before he disappears forever.

01:33.430 --> 01:34.530
I'll do it.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.586
You keep her safe, you hear me?

01:36.590 --> 01:37.580
We will.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.330
You're less than a mile
behind the target car.

01:39.370 --> 01:42.934
I got Metro PDS trying to
build a roadblock around us.

01:46.130 --> 01:47.340
We can't afford to lose them, Jack!

01:47.380 --> 01:49.720
I gave this woman my
word we'd protect her.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.760
get out of the car, right now!

01:51.770 --> 01:56.030
federal agent! She's a federal agent!

01:57.610 --> 01:59.320
Your girlfriend's
been turned by the FBI.

01:59.360 --> 02:02.460
If you let her come to you, you're
risking your chances of escape.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.650
I'll call my driver,
have him take care of her.

02:04.690 --> 02:07.780
No. I'll take care of her.

02:28.010 --> 02:30.130
Sean, I need to talk to you.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.030
–Is it important?
–You tell me.

02:32.070 --> 02:34.840
–Did you issue a federal warrant on this vehicle?
–What?

02:34.880 --> 02:37.360
I found a digital footprint on
server four's backup partition.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.830
It originated from your station.

02:38.870 --> 02:41.350
–I'd like to know what the hell is going on!
–Keep your voice down.

02:41.390 --> 02:43.510
You want to get us caught?

02:43.520 --> 02:46.900
I sent out the warrant, to
sideline Bauer and Renee.

02:46.940 --> 02:49.070
They were closing in on Dubaku.

02:49.090 --> 02:50.970
I thought you said Dubaku's
on his way out of the country?

02:51.010 --> 02:53.350
He is, but his
girlfriend's talking to FBI.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.660
They used her to track him.

02:55.670 --> 02:58.240
–Oh, my God.
–Don't worry, I took care of it.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.840
Bauer and Renee are in police custody.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.010
By the time they're released,
Dubaku will be long gone.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.180
Are you sure?

03:04.210 --> 03:05.350
I'm positive.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.482
Why didn't you just tell
me what was happening?

03:11.170 --> 03:12.740
'Cause I knew you'd react like this.

03:12.780 --> 03:15.590
The last thing I need right
now is one of your meltdowns.

03:15.630 --> 03:20.780
Now, listen, I got you into
this, and I'm going to
get you out of it, but not
if you start panicking.

03:20.820 --> 03:23.360
–You've got to keep it together.
–I'm just really scared, you know?

03:23.400 --> 03:27.250
I know. I am, to I'm just a little
better at hiding it than you are.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.720
I've got everything covered.

03:28.760 --> 03:32.380
I ran a bounce-tap into the conference
room speakerphone that they'll never find,

03:32.420 --> 03:34.090
and I can hear
everything they're saying.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.860
Now, sit at your station.
Try and act normal.

03:38.760 --> 03:43.190
Let me worry about
Bauer and Renée. Okay?

03:49.090 --> 03:51.810
The man that we were tracking is
responsible for today's terrorist attack.

03:51.850 --> 03:53.750
If you don't let us go,
he's going to get away.

03:53.790 --> 03:56.080
Look, my captain's on the
phone with your superior.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.354
You're making a mistake!
You've got to let us go!

04:02.340 --> 04:04.740
That warrant had to be sent out
by one of Dubaku's operatives.

04:04.780 --> 04:05.360
I know.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.250
Then Dubaku knows that
Marika is working with us.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.890
He will kill her, Jack. We should
not have used her like this.

04:09.930 --> 04:11.790
We didn't have a choice.
She was our best asset.

04:11.830 --> 04:14.866
She's not an asset,
Jack. She's a human being.

04:28.430 --> 04:30.270
Colonel.

04:34.050 --> 04:36.000
The FBI is still looking for us, sir.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.680
I'll do this quickly. Wait there for me.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.270
Samuel.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.860
–What is it? Sweetheart, what's wrong?
–Give me your cell phone.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.010
My cell phone?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.990
I know you've been talking to the FBI.

04:52.030 --> 04:54.490
You've been working for them, Marika.

04:55.390 --> 04:58.410
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:00.590 --> 05:02.560
What are you doing?

05:12.620 --> 05:14.260
I trusted you!

05:14.280 --> 05:16.500
How could you do this to me?

05:16.520 --> 05:19.390
The FBI told me who you really are.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.650
About the terrible things you've done.

05:21.690 --> 05:23.740
–And you believed them?
–They showed me proof!

05:23.780 --> 05:26.940
They showed you lies
created by my enemies!

05:27.200 --> 05:28.580
You don't know me.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.560
And you don't know my country.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.150
I brought peace to Sangala.

05:36.450 --> 05:40.660
No. Don't be afraid, huh?

05:40.670 --> 05:41.990
It's just…

05:42.020 --> 05:47.750
when I heard what you had done, it was like
you had driven a dagger through my heart.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.470
I'm a forgiving man, Marika.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.890
I still want you to come with me.

05:54.950 --> 05:57.340
I want to give you the
life that I promised.

05:57.380 --> 06:00.540
I can't go with you.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.780
I don't know who you are.

06:03.810 --> 06:06.520
You do. You do.

06:06.530 --> 06:12.470
If you look past your fear, you'll see that
I am still the man that you fell in love with.

06:14.970 --> 06:17.990
I won't leave without you, Marika.

06:27.390 --> 06:29.330
All right.

06:41.070 --> 06:44.210
You won't be disappointed. Come.

06:45.410 --> 06:47.940
The FBI may be close.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.420
Your story was verified by FBI.

06:52.460 --> 06:53.800
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.440
Did FBI find Marika Donoso?

06:55.480 --> 06:57.370
I don't know. You can ask them yourself.

06:57.410 --> 06:59.710
Agent Moss wants to talk to you.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.020
Larry, where are they? Where's Marika?

07:01.060 --> 07:02.660
We lost her cell phone signal.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.480
–What do you mean? What happened?
–Don't know.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.200
–Just went dead about three minutes ago.
–Where?

07:06.240 --> 07:10.170
In an alley on the northeast corner
of N and 10th street. I'm looking
through traffic cams now.

07:10.210 --> 07:12.850
All right, we're going to comm. Standby.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.600
They lost Marika's signal.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.170
–that's it.
–There.

07:25.210 --> 07:26.810
Jack? We got a make on the car.

07:26.850 --> 07:31.080
It's a dark gray Jeep Grand Cherokee, turned
south on 11th street about two minutes ago.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.240
Copy that. Moving to intercept.

07:32.280 --> 07:35.420
–Did you see Marika?
–Yes. She got in the car with Dubaku.

07:35.460 --> 07:37.150
Chloe, stay on those traffic cams.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.010
I'm on it.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.260
We're ten minutes from the
airfield. Is my plane ready?

07:43.300 --> 07:45.160
Fueled and waiting.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.550
Did you take care of the problem?

07:47.580 --> 07:50.690
She's had a change of
heart. She's coming with me.

07:50.730 --> 07:53.240
Colonel, she was working with the FBI.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.760
You were almost arrested because of her.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.050
She's not your concern.

07:57.090 --> 08:00.456
You just worry about getting
me out of the country.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.370
Who was that?

08:05.380 --> 08:11.030
It was a government official. He's
been working for me. A very corrupt man.

08:11.640 --> 08:15.402
I look forward to no longer
dealing with people like him.

08:18.760 --> 08:22.410
I want to spend time with
people I really care about.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.929
They're still on 11th. They just
crossed over to new York avenue.

08:34.970 --> 08:37.200
Copy that.

08:37.210 --> 08:38.919
–Come on!
–Jack, they're turning left.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.650
Hold on.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.140
–FBI.
–Go! Go!

09:09.330 --> 09:11.060
Hold on!

09:45.130 --> 09:48.826
Get on top of the car! See
if you can maintain a visual.

09:52.170 --> 09:55.590
Marika! Marika!

10:01.020 --> 10:03.470
Jack, they crashed!

10:03.480 --> 10:05.650
Go!

10:07.140 --> 10:08.930
Get back in your car!

10:08.960 --> 10:11.670
Larry, Dubaku's vehicle's
been involved in an accident.

10:11.710 --> 10:14.050
–We need an ambulance, now!
–Copy.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.970
Back away!

10:21.760 --> 10:26.220
Stay on your knees!
Get on the ground, now!

10:26.230 --> 10:28.100
Now!

10:33.730 --> 10:36.030
I got Dubaku.

10:52.810 --> 10:54.390
agent walker, the car is on fire.

10:54.430 --> 10:56.890
Get out of there!

10:57.460 --> 11:00.420
Get out of there!

11:06.330 --> 11:09.770
I gave her my word,
so back off or help me.

11:20.540 --> 11:23.220
It's her leg—
it's pinned.

11:25.230 --> 11:27.180
Hold on.

11:28.590 --> 11:31.480
pull… pull!

11:32.900 --> 11:34.780
Go!

11:37.830 --> 11:39.720
Jack.

11:39.850 --> 11:42.170
Go.

11:45.590 --> 11:48.090
You all right?

11:54.530 --> 11:57.030
Larry, where is my ambulance?

11:57.070 --> 12:00.080
Dubaku's badly injured. He's
unconscious. I need that ambulance now.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.770
They're on their way, Jack.

12:34.830 --> 12:39.080
Admiral Smith estimates we'll have the
capitol of Sangala secured within the hour.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.880
He's surprised how little resistance
our troops have encountered.

12:42.920 --> 12:48.730
And you'll be happy to know we have liberated
the refugee camp in Kasanga province.

12:48.740 --> 12:52.560
2,000 civilians are
safe from Juma's forces.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.890
Madam president?

12:56.900 --> 12:59.020
I'm sorry, Ethan.

12:59.070 --> 13:03.560
Oh, my God, Kasanga province.
That's… that's very good news.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.500
Uh, maybe we should
finish this another time.

13:09.050 --> 13:12.280
Can I get you anything, madam president?

13:12.290 --> 13:14.480
No, thank you.

13:15.190 --> 13:17.820
Would you like to talk about it?

13:20.740 --> 13:24.460
What happened to Henry
was my fault, Ethan.

13:25.070 --> 13:28.790
He never believed our
son committed suicide.

13:28.830 --> 13:31.450
He was right.

13:31.460 --> 13:32.920
And I didn't listen to him.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.040
And if I had, we wouldn't
be here right now.

13:35.080 --> 13:40.790
Henry wouldn't be fighting for his life,
and we might have exposed this conspiracy.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.170
Our government wouldn't be paralyzed.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.770
I didn't believe Henry,
either. No one did.

13:46.810 --> 13:49.950
But I'm his wife.

13:50.590 --> 13:53.730
He deserved my trust.

13:56.100 --> 13:58.140
Madam president?

13:58.160 --> 13:59.510
I'm sorry to interrupt.

13:59.550 --> 14:01.270
It's all right, Bill. Go ahead.

14:01.310 --> 14:05.010
I just spoke to Larry Moss
at FBI. We captured Dubaku.

14:05.020 --> 14:07.960
He was seriously injured in a
car crash during the pursuit.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.630
–How bad?
–Critical, non-responsive.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.200
Jack Bauer and agent
walker are with him.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.850
They'll be there to question him
should he regain consciousness.

14:14.890 --> 14:19.560
So, you're saying that if Dubaku dies, our
chances of uncovering this
conspiracy die with him.

14:19.600 --> 14:24.140
He could be the only one who knows the names of
everyone in the government he's corrupted— yes.

14:24.180 --> 14:27.760
Madam president, given this latest news, I
don't think it's safe for you to remain here.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.820
I strongly urge you to
return to the white house.

14:29.860 --> 14:31.660
I'd prefer to stay with my husband.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.110
You're too exposed. I can't
effectively protect you.

14:34.150 --> 14:36.600
Am I any safer at the white house?

14:36.640 --> 14:40.000
My administration has
been corrupted, Bill,

14:40.030 --> 14:42.500
and now you're telling me we're
about to lose our only lead.

14:42.540 --> 14:46.260
Madam president, I assure you I've taken
every precaution to secure the white house.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.790
It's the safest place
for you to be right now.

14:48.830 --> 14:53.500
Henry will be in surgery for
several hours, madam president.

14:53.510 --> 14:56.360
There's nothing more we can do here.

14:56.370 --> 14:59.500
You are needed in the oval office.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.110
All right.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.540
I'll have the cars brought around.

15:09.580 --> 15:11.950
I'll also redirect your daughter's
escorts to the white house.

15:11.990 --> 15:13.930
Thank you, Bill.

15:18.610 --> 15:21.400
What are we going to do, Ethan?

15:22.390 --> 15:25.660
How can we possibly run this government
when we don't know who we can trust?

15:25.700 --> 15:30.122
We'll just have to pray Jack Bauer
can get those names from Dubaku.

15:35.790 --> 15:36.630
You got him stabilized?

15:36.670 --> 15:38.020
Yes, sir. We're
transporting him right now.

15:38.060 --> 15:39.470
Bring him around. I need to talk to him.

15:39.510 --> 15:40.710
Sir, he's in no condition
to speak right now.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.940
This man has information vital to
national security— bring him around now.

15:43.980 --> 15:45.510
Now!

15:45.520 --> 15:47.860
One milligram epinephrine.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.760
I know you can hear me.
You're in federal custody.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.600
These paramedics are
trying to save your life.

15:58.640 --> 16:01.150
You want them to continue, you're
gonna tell me what I want to know.

16:01.190 --> 16:05.070
I want the names of everyone in the United
States government that you've been working with.

16:05.110 --> 16:08.350
Come on. You and I both know
the game. It's over for you now.

16:08.390 --> 16:11.410
There's no sense in
trying to protect them.

16:12.740 --> 16:14.940
You and I, we're both soldiers.

16:14.990 --> 16:18.560
I know you don't care about your
own life, but you got a family.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.550
I know where your son is in Sangala.

16:20.590 --> 16:22.780
I know where he lives, and I swear
to you, I will track him down,

16:22.820 --> 16:28.550
and I will make him suffer, and I will make
sure that he knows his father was responsible.

16:28.590 --> 16:31.620
All you got to do to make
me stop is give me the names.

16:31.660 --> 16:33.610
Just give me the names.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.430
Don't hurt my family.

16:36.440 --> 16:40.170
I have a list… list.

16:41.230 --> 16:42.140
Where is the list?

16:42.180 --> 16:44.240
–His BP's spiking.
–Give me the list. Where is the list?

16:44.280 --> 16:45.820
–He's going into cardiac arrest.
–Bring him back!

16:45.860 --> 16:50.310
Get the paddles. Start
at 200 joules. Clear.

16:50.320 --> 16:54.540
No response— there's a
glitch. Once more. Clear.

16:54.550 --> 16:57.190
There it is again.
Electronic interference.

16:57.230 --> 17:00.060
This could be it— feels like
a metal plate or something.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.980
All right. Amping up to 300. Clear.

17:02.990 --> 17:04.400
–Where's the plate?
–All right.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.650
He's stabilized—
let's get him boarded.

17:05.690 --> 17:08.660
–Where's the plate?
–It's below his rib cage.

17:08.680 --> 17:09.650
Open him up.

17:09.670 --> 17:11.319
Sir, we don't have time. I
have to ask you to step aside.

17:11.359 --> 17:15.210
You open him up now. Do it.

17:31.410 --> 17:34.090
Sir, this man will die if we
don't get him to the hospital.

17:34.130 --> 17:36.250
Get him out of here.

17:45.840 --> 17:46.520
FBI.

17:46.550 --> 17:48.680
Patch me through to agent Moss.

17:48.690 --> 17:50.590
–This is Moss.
–Larry, it's Jack.

17:50.630 --> 17:51.330
Go ahead, Jack.

17:51.370 --> 17:55.070
I found some kind of digital storage
device implanted under Dubaku's skin.

17:55.110 --> 17:56.960
–What is it?
–In an effort to protect his family,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.510
he said he would provide me with a list
of all of his U.S government contacts.

17:59.550 --> 18:01.870
He said it was on him; he meant, in him.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.180
Larry, this is his insurance
policy. I'm sure of it.

18:04.220 --> 18:07.540
Jack, we need that data as soon as
possible. Can you upload the files to FBI?

18:07.580 --> 18:10.946
I don't think so. I've
never seen anything like it.

18:11.260 --> 18:15.240
Hold on one second. Officer. Officer.

18:15.740 --> 18:17.290
My name is Jack Bauer.
I'm working with the FBI.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.170
I need you to get this device
to regional headquarters.

18:19.210 --> 18:20.900
I want you to give it
to an agent Larry Moss.

18:20.940 --> 18:22.960
You put this in his hands,
his hands only. You understand?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.630
–Yes, sir.
–Do it.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.240
Larry, you got a
chopper coming your way.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.980
You should have the drive in five
minutes. We're gonna stay with Dubaku.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.840
Get back to us as soon
as you got anything.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.340
Copy that.

18:42.400 --> 18:46.280
Sean. What is it? What's wrong?

18:46.290 --> 18:48.020
Just listen to me, and
try not to overreact.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.810
Okay, we have a situation, but
I think I ha a way to handle it.

18:50.850 --> 18:54.140
What situation? You told me you
had everything under control.

18:54.180 --> 18:57.770
I do… but they have Dubaku's database.

18:57.780 --> 18:59.290
What?

18:59.320 --> 19:01.700
Sean, our names are on that list. You
told me that you were taking care of this,

19:01.740 --> 19:03.120
and now you're telling me
that they have our names?

19:03.160 --> 19:05.540
No, they don't have our
names yet, so here's the plan.

19:05.580 --> 19:08.180
Sean, we have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here right now!

19:08.220 --> 19:12.140
–I'm not going to jail, Sean! Do you hear me?
–Nobody's going to jail. I promise.

19:12.180 --> 19:14.630
I'm sick of your promises. You promised
me that this is all taken care of.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.530
You promised me you're
leaving your wife.

19:16.570 --> 19:18.190
You make all these promises,
but you never keep any of them!

19:18.230 --> 19:21.740
St talking, and just listen to me—
now, I told you I have a way out of this,

19:21.780 --> 19:23.850
but I need your help,
do you understand that?

19:23.890 --> 19:26.800
Now, listen… okay?

19:27.500 --> 19:31.600
As soon as O'Brian downloads those files,
we're gonna crash the entire system,

19:31.640 --> 19:34.150
every single server on this floor.

19:34.190 --> 19:35.460
That's crazy.

19:35.490 --> 19:39.270
No, it's not crazy. We're gonna
go up to the mainframe room…

19:39.310 --> 19:41.990
initiate a system-wide reformat.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.880
We'll wipe everything clean, and
they won't be able to stop it.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.620
We're gonna have to bypass a
lot of safety protocols, okay?

19:48.660 --> 19:52.818
But nobody's better at dealing
with those servers than you are.

19:52.980 --> 19:55.530
Isn't that true?

19:56.960 --> 20:01.440
I need your help. I
can't do this without you.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.110
Erika?

20:09.120 --> 20:12.730
Yeah. Okay.

20:17.590 --> 20:19.620
we're gonna have to…

20:19.650 --> 20:22.500
tie the main servers together.

20:23.090 --> 20:27.000
I need an AVI motherboard, but you're gonna
have to reconfigure it for a macro uplink.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.710
Okay, and we have to hurry.

20:28.750 --> 20:31.360
The drive is gonna be here any minute.

20:31.370 --> 20:33.330
Go up to the mainframe
room and get started.

20:33.370 --> 20:35.550
I'm gonna prep the motherboard.
I'll meet you up there.

20:35.590 --> 20:37.740
–Okay.
–Okay.

20:41.170 --> 20:43.050
We're gonna be fine.

20:44.630 --> 20:46.980
I love you.

20:48.930 --> 20:52.430
–I love you, too.
–Okay, let's go.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.408
these are Marika
Donoso's personal effects.

21:22.540 --> 21:25.610
–Thank you.
–Copy that. Get back to me.

21:28.310 --> 21:29.750
That was Larry. They got the drive.

21:29.790 --> 21:30.990
Chloe's gonna be working on them.

21:31.030 --> 21:33.310
They should have something
in the next few minutes.

21:33.350 --> 21:35.940
That's all that matters, right, Jack?

21:36.520 --> 21:38.670
I don't like what happened to
Marika any more than you do.

21:38.710 --> 21:41.330
We did what was necessary. You better
figure out a way to live with it.

21:41.370 --> 21:45.792
How, Jack? Pretend that it never
happened? Is it that easy for you?

21:47.360 --> 21:50.410
I'll let you know when
Chloe's got something.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.850
Here it is.

22:05.350 --> 22:09.046
This is a PX-1-7 drive. It's
got an auto-erase function.

22:09.280 --> 22:12.080
We've only got one download.

22:33.350 --> 22:35.370
where have you been?

22:35.390 --> 22:38.096
Just took a little
longer than I thought.

22:42.470 --> 22:44.260
–what are you doing?
–Checking surveillance.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.310
Got to keep an eye on Larry and O'Brian.

22:47.340 --> 22:50.530
Once we do this, they're gonna realize
someone's up here in a few seconds.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.990
We'll have to make a clean exit.

22:55.870 --> 22:57.200
How much longer is this going to take?

22:57.240 --> 22:59.930
I just have to bypass safety protocols.

22:59.940 --> 23:02.778
once they're down,
I'll start the reformat.

23:06.640 --> 23:07.320
Go ahead.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.510
Dubaku hasn't arrived at the airfield,
and he's not answering his cell phone.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.400
–What's going on?
–FBI got him.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.420
What?

23:14.430 --> 23:15.740
How long have you known about this?

23:15.780 --> 23:18.180
They're not going to get anything out
of him. He's unconscious in the hospital.

23:18.220 --> 23:20.580
There was a crash during a chase.

23:20.620 --> 23:24.460
Listen, the FBI recovered that database
you told me about, the list of names.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.800
I'm in the process of deleting it.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.160
I'm going to erase every trace of it.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.200
I don't have to tell you what
will happen if they get that list.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.570
They won't. I'm gonna
take care of the database.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.420
You need to take care of Dubaku.

23:33.460 --> 23:35.750
–Don't worry about him. You just make sure…
–Damn it!

23:35.790 --> 23:38.100
I got to go. What's wrong?

23:38.110 --> 23:40.010
–It-it isn't working.
–What do you mean, it isn't working?

23:40.050 --> 23:43.690
All the inputs are active, the servers
are aligned, but the reformat won't start.

23:43.730 --> 23:44.850
It doesn't make any sense.

23:44.890 --> 23:47.510
Okay, well, just-just think
it through, Erika. Right?

23:47.550 --> 23:50.390
–You can do this.
–Would you just shut up? Okay?

23:50.430 --> 23:56.900
Okay. Has to be server three. All right,
server three was upgraded last week.

23:57.420 --> 24:01.560
Which means they restored the partitions
to the system default settings.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.130
How could I be so stupid?

24:04.150 --> 24:08.970
I just have to configure the parameters.

24:09.530 --> 24:11.970
Okay.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.320
okay? Is that it?

24:20.680 --> 24:23.400
I think so.

24:25.210 --> 24:28.090
Program's running.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.470
what? What's happening? What's going on?

24:32.510 --> 24:34.710
–The hard drive's reformatting.
–What?

24:34.750 --> 24:36.430
The files are being erased.
We're losing everything.

24:36.470 --> 24:38.870
–Well, make it stop.
–I don't have the access.

24:38.910 --> 24:42.144
–Get the PX-1-7 out.
–It's too late. It's erased.

24:45.950 --> 24:48.840
This is deliberate. It's not a glitch.
Someone's trying to crash the system.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.580
–Where's your mainframe room?
–Come on.

24:57.190 --> 24:59.130
Here they come. We
got to get out of here.

24:59.170 --> 25:00.750
–Almost there.
–Erika…

25:00.760 --> 25:02.210
–it's done.
–Are you sure?

25:02.250 --> 25:07.380
Yeah. It'll take a few minutes for the reformat
to be complete, but there's no stopping it.

25:07.420 --> 25:11.840
–Oh, baby. I knew you could do it.
–Yeah. We gonna be okay?

25:13.340 --> 25:16.020
We're gonna be fine.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.630
sorry.

26:10.990 --> 26:12.430
–get on the floor!
–It wasn't me!

26:12.470 --> 26:14.920
Get on the floor!

26:23.600 --> 26:26.250
Larry, it wasn't me.

26:27.340 --> 26:28.360
Chloe!

26:28.400 --> 26:30.070
Larry, I followed her up here.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.210
She was trying to crash the system.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.520
She shot me!

26:34.530 --> 26:35.890
I we for the weapon, and it went off.

26:35.930 --> 26:36.920
Security, this is agent Moss.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.740
I need a team to lock
down the mainframe room.

26:38.780 --> 26:40.490
And get a medic up here!

26:40.500 --> 26:41.690
Chloe, can you recover the files?

26:41.730 --> 26:44.380
–I don't know yet.
–What files? What the hell is happening?

26:44.420 --> 26:46.220
You tell me what the
hell is happening, Sean!

26:46.260 --> 26:48.620
You were shutting me out, Larry,
so I looked around on my own.

26:48.660 --> 26:51.480
I found out that Erika was
rerouting the sub-cam channel!

26:51.520 --> 26:53.130
What the hell was she doing?

26:53.170 --> 26:56.210
She sent out a-a warrant on
a vehicle with two suspects.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.020
I knew something was wrong.
That's not part of her job.

26:58.060 --> 27:00.310
I asked her about it,
and she tried to deny it.

27:00.350 --> 27:01.730
She was acting very strangely.

27:01.770 --> 27:02.910
Why didn't you say anything?

27:02.950 --> 27:06.020
I don't know what the hell it meant,
so I hacked into her hard drive,

27:06.060 --> 27:08.430
and I found schematics
for the main server.

27:08.470 --> 27:10.880
Bypass codes for the safety protocols.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.300
I followed her up here
to see what she was up to.

27:13.340 --> 27:18.270
The second I realized she was trying
to crash the system, I-I confronted her.

27:18.310 --> 27:20.970
She shot me.

27:21.350 --> 27:23.760
I went for the gun.

27:23.790 --> 27:26.020
Larry, I didn't mean to kill her.

27:27.860 --> 27:29.030
Halt! Halt!

27:29.040 --> 27:32.860
Larry, it's too late. The system's
fried. Dubaku's files are gone.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.460
Are you sure? Can you recover anything?

27:34.500 --> 27:37.900
The server's wiped
clean. She got everything.

27:54.060 --> 27:55.700
Is this everything you got?

27:55.740 --> 27:58.440
No, it's not. I didn't have time
to print out every single message

27:58.480 --> 28:04.750
that came through Erika's workstation. That's
everything she was doing for the past three days.

28:05.010 --> 28:08.090
Look, Larry, I told you what happened.
I feel like you owe me an explanation.

28:08.130 --> 28:10.880
What the hell is going on here?

28:15.980 --> 28:18.670
the government's been
compromised by Dubaku.

28:18.710 --> 28:21.150
FBI, secret service. God knows who else.

28:21.190 --> 28:24.090
That's why I shut you out,
brought in Chloe O'Brian.

28:24.130 --> 28:27.690
We were in the middle of decrypting a file that
had the names of everyone on Dubaku's payroll.

28:27.730 --> 28:29.580
Erika erased it when
she wiped the server.

28:29.620 --> 28:32.190
That was our only lead.

28:32.490 --> 28:35.390
You should have told me about
this. You should have trusted me.

28:35.430 --> 28:37.980
Sean, I didn't know who to trust.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.850
You all right? How's your arm?

28:41.890 --> 28:44.070
It hurts like hell. It's fine.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.570
When you're up for it, I'm gonna
need you to write a statement.

28:46.610 --> 28:47.630
Okay.

28:47.660 --> 28:49.880
And keep your mouth shut.

28:49.890 --> 28:53.950
we don't know who else in this building
might be working for Dubaku. Yeah.

28:53.990 --> 28:55.610
Larry, don't ask me how, but I did it.

28:55.650 --> 28:56.350
You did what?

28:56.390 --> 28:58.890
I recovered Dubaku's files.

29:00.220 --> 29:00.780
What?

29:00.810 --> 29:02.920
I was running a mirror
file on an outside server.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.350
I always do that when I'm
dealing with sensitive materials.

29:05.390 --> 29:08.620
Erika's parameters were
too narrow to catch it.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.710
How soon can you have it decrypted?

29:10.750 --> 29:12.680
It's decrypted. It's been
decrypting this entire time.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.670
Dubaku kept detailed
evidence on everyone.

29:14.710 --> 29:17.830
Phone logs, financial
records— it's all here.

29:17.850 --> 29:20.440
Listen, I'm gonna need you to
cross-check with FBI personnel.

29:20.480 --> 29:23.590
Sean said Erika was working by
herself, but I got to be 100% sure.

29:23.630 --> 29:26.900
–Okay. Hold on.
–Yeah.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.850
Chloe recovered the files.

29:32.330 --> 29:35.420
That's great.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.414
–I should get to that statement.
–Yeah.

29:40.590 --> 29:42.270
Sean?

29:42.300 --> 29:45.520
When you're done there, I want you
to go downstairs and see Dr Weber.

29:45.560 --> 29:48.890
You shot a fellow agent. You're
gonna want to talk to somebody.

29:48.930 --> 29:51.070
Yes, sir.

30:06.550 --> 30:08.250
Hey, do you have any idea
what's going on with the servers?

30:08.290 --> 30:09.330
Not a clue.

30:09.370 --> 30:10.400
The whole system's down.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.680
I tried to get into the mainframe room,
and security has got it locked off.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.510
Ask Larry about it, Janis.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.540
Where are you going?

30:17.580 --> 30:20.210
–I got to run an errand.
–Now?

30:54.570 --> 30:58.000
–All right, all right.
–Hold off.

31:00.880 --> 31:04.080
you better start
talking to me right now!

31:06.440 --> 31:09.180
I'd like to speak with my attorney.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.260
Put him in holding.

31:24.170 --> 31:24.940
Yes, sir.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.610
Get me Bill Buchanan at the White House.

31:40.370 --> 31:43.490
Where is my sister? Where's Marika?

31:45.190 --> 31:46.960
There was an accident.

31:46.990 --> 31:49.480
What happened?

31:49.490 --> 31:51.340
Marika didn't make it.

31:51.350 --> 31:53.760
What-what do you mean?

31:54.530 --> 31:57.690
There was a crash. Uh, it
happened during the pursuit.

31:57.730 --> 32:00.440
Marika was killed.

32:00.660 --> 32:03.400
I don't understand.

32:03.430 --> 32:05.920
You said that you'd protect
her. You said she'd be okay.

32:05.960 --> 32:08.830
We wouldn't have caught
Dubaku without Marika's help.

32:08.870 --> 32:11.420
She was very, very brave, Rosa.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.450
What is this?

32:15.480 --> 32:18.400
This is supposed to
make everything okay?

32:18.410 --> 32:21.530
Marika was all I had!

32:21.570 --> 32:25.230
I trusted you with her
life, and you let her die?

32:25.260 --> 32:28.400
–I'm so sorry.
–Don't touch me!

32:32.000 --> 32:34.480
you killed my sister!

32:34.520 --> 32:38.590
You didn't care how you
did it or who got hurt!

32:42.140 --> 32:44.240
Agent walker?

32:49.750 --> 32:51.550
Excuse me.

32:58.110 --> 33:01.490
I just got off the phone with
Larry. Dubaku wasn't lying.

33:01.530 --> 33:04.770
On the drive was a list of everyone
he was working with in the government.

33:04.810 --> 33:08.440
They're getting ready to
make arrests. It's over.

33:12.110 --> 33:14.430
It's not over for Rosa.

33:17.800 --> 33:20.090
What happened to Marika was a tragedy.

33:20.130 --> 33:23.770
But I'm not going to stand here and tell you
what we did was wrong, because we weren't.

33:23.810 --> 33:27.560
She made a choice, a brave one,
to get involved, but she made it.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.430
God, listen to yourself, Jack. You don't
even sound human. Don't you feel anything?

33:31.470 --> 33:33.290
We had a job to do!

33:33.340 --> 33:36.710
To protect the hundreds if not thousands of
innocent lives that would not have had a choice

33:36.750 --> 33:39.390
if we let a terrorist attack take place.

33:40.810 --> 33:45.070
What we did wasn't
wrong. It was necessary.

33:46.660 --> 33:48.260
I read your file.

33:48.300 --> 33:52.230
When your wife was killed, did you feel that or
did you just tell yourself
that that was necessary?

33:52.270 --> 33:55.100
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?

33:55.140 --> 33:56.830
I just want to know
that you feel something!

33:56.870 --> 33:59.800
I want to know that you feel
the same kind of pain that I do!

33:59.840 --> 34:03.870
Do you feel that? Do you feel that?

34:11.550 --> 34:13.889
it's all right.

34:16.650 --> 34:19.500
You're going to be all right.

34:20.420 --> 34:23.409
It's going to take a while.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.650
But you will learn to live with it.

34:25.690 --> 34:29.070
What if I don't want to
learn to live with it?

34:29.730 --> 34:32.350
Then quit.

34:33.550 --> 34:37.929
And by the way, that stunt
you pulled by the car…

34:38.630 --> 34:43.770
you ever pull your weapon on my
again, you better intend to use it.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.790
I did.

35:14.950 --> 35:17.380
–Olivia.
–What's going on?

35:17.390 --> 35:19.740
How's dad?

35:20.350 --> 35:23.930
He's still in surgery.
We're waiting for word.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.630
Is he going to be all right?

35:26.670 --> 35:29.340
He was seriously injured.

35:29.380 --> 35:31.870
The bullet went through his lung.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.300
Livy.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.500
The doctors are doing
everything they can.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.670
Who did this?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.720
It's complicated.

35:47.170 --> 35:50.080
I want to know who shot my father!

35:50.480 --> 35:55.010
Your father found out about a
conspiracy inside the government.

35:55.050 --> 35:57.020
The people behind it tried to kill him.

35:57.060 --> 35:58.220
Who are these people?

35:58.260 --> 36:01.130
We're trying to find out right now.

36:01.150 --> 36:03.700
That's all I can tell you.

36:03.710 --> 36:05.690
Okay, I want to go to the hospital.

36:05.730 --> 36:08.180
–I want to be there when he wakes up.
–I can't let you do that.

36:08.220 --> 36:11.400
The people who shot your father
are still out there. It's not safe.

36:11.440 --> 36:13.290
I don't care, I want to see dad!

36:13.330 --> 36:14.830
This is not a debate.

36:14.860 --> 36:16.620
I'm not going to risk
anything happening to you.

36:16.660 --> 36:20.530
You're staying in the white
house, and that's the end of it.

36:20.570 --> 36:23.090
Madam president, Bill
Buchanan is here to see you.

36:23.130 --> 36:25.870
I'll be right out.

36:28.400 --> 36:32.000
There's a lot we need
to talk out, Olivia.

36:32.760 --> 36:36.400
We've been ignoring
things for far too long.

36:36.410 --> 36:39.990
It took dad getting shot for
you to finally want to talk?

36:40.030 --> 36:42.990
Let's not go down this path.

36:43.590 --> 36:46.940
Not again. Not today.

36:49.630 --> 36:51.460
We'll talk later.

36:51.480 --> 36:54.912
One of the guards will take
you up to the residence.

37:04.930 --> 37:05.860
All right, Bill. What is it?

37:05.900 --> 37:08.230
I have very good news.

37:08.250 --> 37:11.250
Jack Bauer just recovered
a database hidden on Dubaku.

37:11.290 --> 37:14.280
It contains the names of everyone in
the government who was working with him.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.170
How many?

37:15.190 --> 37:17.790
Close to a hundred people,
across all agencies.

37:17.830 --> 37:19.880
–Some at very high levels.
–My God.

37:19.920 --> 37:23.040
Dubaku kept detailed
files on every person.

37:23.070 --> 37:25.450
This is exactly what we've been
working toward, madam president.

37:25.490 --> 37:28.460
We can finally put an
end to this conspiracy.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.870
I assume you've already begun
acting on this information.

37:31.910 --> 37:34.980
Yes. As a matter of fact, Larry Moss
just identified two more individuals

37:35.020 --> 37:37.730
working within FBI who were on the list.

37:37.760 --> 37:40.170
He's confident the bureau is secure.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.586
What's the next step?

37:41.610 --> 37:44.320
I'm working with FBI to
coordinate an interagency sweep.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.450
We should start making
arrests within the hour.

37:46.490 --> 37:49.760
Bill, I don't know what
to say to thank you.

37:49.780 --> 37:53.130
What you have done here today
puts all of us in your debt.

37:53.170 --> 37:57.990
I appreciate that, madam president,
but there are a lot of people to thank,

37:58.030 --> 38:00.340
including Jack Bauer.

38:02.100 --> 38:05.960
He's scheduled to resume his testimony
before the senate committee tomorrow morning.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.520
I'm aware of that.

38:07.570 --> 38:09.370
Madam president, forgive
me if I'm out of line,

38:09.410 --> 38:14.330
but I feel senator Mayer is on
a personal crusade against Jack.

38:14.570 --> 38:16.670
He's already taken his pound of flesh.

38:16.710 --> 38:21.590
He dismantled CTU, attacked the reputations of
people who've served this country with honor.

38:21.630 --> 38:24.120
Now he wants to make an example of Jack.

38:24.160 --> 38:28.690
It isn't right, madam president,
especially after today.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.570
What are you asking me to do, Bill?

38:30.610 --> 38:33.840
I'm asking you to
speak to senator Mayer.

38:34.570 --> 38:36.820
Jack Bauer helped save this country.

38:36.860 --> 38:40.754
He doesn't deserve to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

38:41.990 --> 38:45.990
I appreciate your sentiments, Bill, but
I'm going to have to think about this.

38:46.030 --> 38:49.440
That's all I'm asking,
madam president. Thank you.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.060
What the hell are you doing here?

39:24.100 --> 39:26.740
–I need to talk with you.
–About what?

39:26.750 --> 39:28.600
I told you I was going
to follow up on a lead.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.840
No, you said you were going to turn
yourself in as soon as this was over.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.690
And I will. But this ain't over yet.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.680
There's going to be
another attack. Here in DC.

39:38.720 --> 39:39.780
Dubaku is in custody.

39:39.820 --> 39:42.580
He's already provided us with a list of everyone
in the government that was working with him.

39:42.620 --> 39:44.870
It's not Dubaku.

39:44.900 --> 39:47.480
It's his boss, Juma.

39:48.050 --> 39:50.910
He knows he's about to
lose control of his country.

39:50.950 --> 39:53.870
So he's going to try and rally his people
behind him by striking back at the U.S.

39:53.910 --> 39:55.810
How do you know this?

39:55.870 --> 39:58.770
–I tracked down a source.
–What source?

39:59.500 --> 40:02.390
He was one of the men I
worked with on Emerson's crew.

40:02.430 --> 40:07.050
He had a direct line of communication
with the Juma regime in Sangala.

40:07.840 --> 40:12.180
It wasn't easy getting the information out
of him, but I'm convinced it's accurate.

40:12.220 --> 40:14.410
–Then you should hand it over to FBI.
–No.

40:14.450 --> 40:18.710
My source tells me that the
window opens at 1900 hours.

40:18.760 --> 40:24.766
By the time the FBI wades through their
procedures and red tape,
it's going to be too late.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.580
What's the target?

40:27.590 --> 40:30.470
He doesn't know the exact target,

40:31.000 --> 40:35.270
but it's definitely going to be
of high value and high impact.

40:36.980 --> 40:39.170
He gave me the name of somebody
who's been involved in the planning.

40:39.210 --> 40:41.250
Who?

40:41.270 --> 40:44.110
Ryan Burnett.

40:44.720 --> 40:47.180
Senator Mayer's chief of staff.

40:47.190 --> 40:49.330
That's right.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.090
He's been involved
from the very beginning.

40:51.130 --> 40:54.760
–What about Mayer?
–No. He's not involved.

40:54.770 --> 40:57.550
–You're sure about that?
–Yeah.

41:00.470 --> 41:03.300
You better not be lying to me, Tony.

41:05.420 --> 41:08.520
This is real, Jack.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.750
Burnett will be on Dubaku's list.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.540
As soon as he finds out that Dubaku's
in custody, he'll start running.

41:15.580 --> 41:16.890
You don't have a lot of time.

41:16.930 --> 41:19.500
I've already got a tail on him.

41:20.890 --> 41:26.990
listen, Jack, if you're with me, meet me
at the corner of first and constitution.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.930
I need your help.

41:51.880 --> 41:54.100
Thank you for your patience.

41:54.110 --> 41:58.280
As I'm sure some of you already know,
our government and its ancillary agencies,

41:58.320 --> 42:04.040
including this office, have been infiltrated
by operatives in league with Ike Dubaku.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.060
yes, senator?

42:08.100 --> 42:10.040
Ryan, can you step in here?

42:10.050 --> 42:11.910
Yes, sir.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.570
–I'm going to the white house.
–Sir?

42:23.470 --> 42:26.980
President Taylor wants to speak
to me regarding Jack Bauer.

42:27.020 --> 42:29.110
Bauer? What about him?

42:29.120 --> 42:32.950
I don't know, but we'll
find out soon enough.

42:33.610 --> 42:35.930
–It's odd, though.
–What is, sir?

42:36.370 --> 42:40.550
Bauer was pulled away from the senate hearings
this morning to help the
FBI with an investigation.

42:40.590 --> 42:44.310
And now the president wants
to talk to me about him.

42:44.320 --> 42:47.330
I don't like the timing of this.

42:47.340 --> 42:50.980
Grab your laptop, Ryan.
I want you there with me.

42:51.380 --> 42:56.858
Yes, sir. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=—proudly
