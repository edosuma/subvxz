00:20.020 --> 00:21.355
What time do you have?

00:22.823 --> 00:24.225
Uh...

00:25.126 --> 00:26.194
it's time.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.596
**

03:12.860 --> 03:15.329
**

03:34.081 --> 03:36.817
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:36.884 --> 03:39.052
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:39.119 --> 03:42.089
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:42.155 --> 03:44.492
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:44.558 --> 03:47.561
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:47.628 --> 03:49.797
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:49.863 --> 03:53.166
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

03:53.233 --> 03:54.468
* I can't let go *

04:07.047 --> 04:09.016
* I feel *

04:14.788 --> 04:15.823
Good.

04:15.889 --> 04:16.957
Come on, Maddie!

04:18.191 --> 04:19.960
I got one!

04:20.027 --> 04:21.762
*

04:24.131 --> 04:25.633
Ah, boom!

04:27.067 --> 04:28.201
She's good, your daughter.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.870
Thanks. Yours, too.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.009
So, uh, that thing
we talked about?

04:36.076 --> 04:37.110
Not an issue.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.346
Appreciate it, guy.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.880
- Really.
- Don't mention it, sport.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.916
Ah. What a dick.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.018
Way to go, Mads.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.611
**

05:16.417 --> 05:17.351
Hi, Mom.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.719
Didn't hear me honk?

05:18.786 --> 05:19.853
Sorry. Music.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.689
- Hey, Grace.
- Hey, John.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.123
How are you?

05:23.190 --> 05:24.224
Can't complain.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.893
Good. Have a good visit?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.160
- Yeah.
- Good.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.529
Why don't you go
get your stuff?

05:28.596 --> 05:29.797
It's kind of early.

05:29.863 --> 05:30.898
You got homework.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.400
Okay.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.435
She's got
an SAT practice exam.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.969
That's the first thing.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.070
Burger while you wait?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.338
No. I'm good.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.873
Where's Ellen?

05:39.940 --> 05:40.708
Here I am.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.776
- Oh. Ellen.
- Grace.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.877
Iced tea?

05:43.944 --> 05:45.345
No. It's good.
I got to run.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.915
Oh, come on. You have
time for an iced tea.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.617
Sit for a minute.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.718
Okay.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.753
Do I need a taster?

05:52.820 --> 05:54.655
Why, you think
I'd slip you a roofie?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.924
Well, it crossed my mind.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.392
Nah. You're not my type.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.594
Cheers.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.634
So, ladies, how's work?

06:08.469 --> 06:09.737
- It's fine.
- Fine.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.945
I'm starving.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.179
Yeah. Me, too.

06:19.246 --> 06:20.380
That's why I like In-N-Out:

06:20.448 --> 06:21.815
you're in, you're out.

06:21.882 --> 06:22.616
Any luck?

06:22.683 --> 06:24.217
I've left messages.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.586
This is way better,
Dad. Trust me.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.020
You love In-N-Out.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.589
The Animal Fries.
What's better than that?

06:28.656 --> 06:29.990
Yeah, I know, but--

06:30.057 --> 06:31.825
But, Maddie, you've never
even been here before.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.227
It's true, but everyone
at school keeps
talking about it:

06:34.294 --> 06:36.430
Danny Meyer, first
Shake Shack in L.A.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.098
Any relation
to Oscar?

06:38.165 --> 06:39.533
- Who?
- Sorry.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.168
I'm not up
on my trendy eateries.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.369
Philistine.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.938
I'm a throwback.
Check my fur.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.407
I love that bracelet,
Anita.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.209
Oh, thanks, Maddie.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.911
Thrift store catch.
It's so retro.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.680
Well, actually,
it's not--

06:52.746 --> 06:53.981
What are you going to get?

06:54.047 --> 06:56.149
I don't know.
A shake, I guess.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.885
We should go in
and look at the menu.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.454
- Will you hold our place?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.424
- She hates me.
- No, not at all.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.860
It's okay.
I'll win her over.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.878
You've been running a shadow
investigation behind my back.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.514
- I'm not.
- Trying to protect your boy?

07:26.580 --> 07:27.848
Not true.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.650
He not only didn't
tell me what he had,

07:29.717 --> 07:31.184
he pumped my partner
about the marks
on Gunn's neck.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.753
We were just talking, Jimmy.
That's all, just talking.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.122
Shit speaks for itself.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.490
I ran the outburst, too.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.058
You've been stalking Gunn
for years,

07:38.125 --> 07:39.960
and then the last
six months, nothing.
What's that?

07:40.027 --> 07:41.562
I don't know, Jimmy.
You tell me.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.796
Well, you decided

07:42.863 --> 07:44.665
the hell
with making a case.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.199
Punched Gunn's
ticket yourself.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.501
Are you saying I did that?

07:47.568 --> 07:49.202
Hey, I'm still working it.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.339
I want what they have, LT,

07:52.405 --> 07:54.074
even if it points
at your buddy here.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.876
Hey, stop. Just stop.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.545
This is blood
under the bridge.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.712
Can we move on?

07:58.779 --> 08:00.548
I don't know. Can we?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.783
I apologize for not
looping you in sooner

08:02.850 --> 08:04.217
as to what
we were thinking.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.454
Listening.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.857
Holland had Gunn killed,

08:09.923 --> 08:12.392
and then he staged it
to implicate Bosch.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.094
The glass
with Harry's prints,

08:14.161 --> 08:15.863
the owl, the quote.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.966
That's a frame?

08:19.032 --> 08:21.535
"God sees" in Latin?

08:21.602 --> 08:22.903
Give me a break.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.905
Fuck your owl.
I'm not buying it.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.840
- Motive?
- To smear Bosch,

08:26.907 --> 08:29.342
discredit his testimony
before the trial.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.711
And who hit Gunn?

08:30.778 --> 08:32.880
Wasn't Holland.
He's under house arrest.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.014
Tafero.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.482
Rudy was around when I
caught the Gunn case.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.050
He knows what it meant to me.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.954
So they whacked Gunn
to frame you.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.991
That's a long drive,
brother.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.626
You know what?
You don't need to buy it.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.260
You just need to solve it.
Can you do that?

08:47.327 --> 08:48.395
- Gunn's murder?
- Mm-hmm.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.563
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.731
And Anderson,

08:50.798 --> 08:51.965
I don't care where
he got the tip.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.667
- You back him off.
- Roger that.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.769
I can tell you exactly
where he got it.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.271
Why don't you go
to hell, Harry?

08:58.338 --> 08:59.707
All right, great.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.075
Now that we are all one
big happy family again,

09:02.142 --> 09:04.878
let's put the personal
shit aside and get to it.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.818
Hey, Harry, the kid that was
killed the other night

09:10.884 --> 09:12.085
by the Hollywood Bowl.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.721
it's connected
to the Meadows murder?

09:13.787 --> 09:15.555
Be a coincidence
if it's not.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.291
Wounds indicate
an expertise in killing,

09:18.358 --> 09:20.027
knowledge of anatomy.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.294
Looks military.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.496
Stabbed in the neck here.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.667
Hit the vagus nerve,
immobilizes the victim.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.602
Down stroke cuts the bleeders.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.404
Two quick cuts. Precise.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.840
Bled out in 30 seconds.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.642
Wow. Jesus, Harry,
where'd you learn that?

09:34.708 --> 09:37.410
Q Corps, Special Forces.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.112
Close Quarter Combat 101.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.114
I think the killer
had spec ops training.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.183
Okay, but why?
Why kill the kid?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.284
Possible witness.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.418
Was he?

09:45.485 --> 09:46.920
- He didn't see a thing.
- Uh.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.588
I should have been
more careful

09:48.656 --> 09:50.190
and not talked to him
in public.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.192
- I put him at risk.
- Okay, don't go there.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.628
It goes where it goes.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.942
Detective, join me.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.243
No, thanks.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.846
This won't take long.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.381
How long you looking
at a job

10:14.447 --> 10:15.983
for the murder
of Edward Gunn?

10:18.418 --> 10:19.853
You've been told
to shut it down.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.722
I'm not shutting
anything down.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.456
It's a cover-up?

10:23.523 --> 10:25.292
The suspect
is not with the LAPD.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.861
- You lied to me.
- I was mistaken.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.099
This is so fucked up.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.334
- I apologize.
- You apologize?

10:34.401 --> 10:36.169
Fuck you.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.438
This is my ass. What if
I had run that story?

10:38.505 --> 10:39.973
Lucky you didn't.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.008
Ha.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.211
If it comes out

10:44.277 --> 10:46.646
that you falsely accused
one of your own--

10:46.714 --> 10:48.716
And how would that
happen?

10:48.782 --> 10:50.150
Word gets around.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.485
Don't fuck with me, Anderson.

10:52.552 --> 10:53.620
Veteran detective

10:53.687 --> 10:55.455
points finger
at a fellow officer

10:55.522 --> 10:56.623
and then recants,

10:56.690 --> 10:58.391
possibly under pressure.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.528
What's really going on
in the Gunn case?

11:01.594 --> 11:02.830
LAPD cover-up?

11:02.896 --> 11:05.665
That's my story.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.134
Go ahead and write it.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.069
And ever department source
you ever had

11:09.136 --> 11:11.304
will dry up
like the L.A. River.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.616
The Koreatown Killer,
aka KTK,

11:23.683 --> 11:25.685
first became active
four years ago.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.755
Half a dozen
robbery assaults.

11:27.821 --> 11:30.523
Four carjackings,
three shootings,
two murders.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.225
Incidents occurring
roughly every six months.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.895
How do we know
it's the same guy
every time?

11:34.962 --> 11:36.096
Same gun all three shootings.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.898
Prints on one bike
match prints

11:37.965 --> 11:39.266
found on another
victim's vehicle.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.801
DNA from several scenes.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.469
Eyewitness descriptions
pretty consistent, too.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.703
It's the same guy.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.739
And we still don't
have a suspect?

11:45.806 --> 11:46.874
Not in the system.

11:46.940 --> 11:47.941
Never been arrested

11:48.008 --> 11:49.509
or served in the military

11:49.576 --> 11:51.311
or worked for the Post Office
or taught school.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.781
I get it.
Always on a bicycle?

11:53.847 --> 11:54.948
It's his signature.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.884
Well, why Koreatown?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.685
Are these hate crimes?

11:58.752 --> 11:59.987
Are they targeting
Koreans?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.089
We don't think so.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.623
The victims have been
white and black

12:03.690 --> 12:04.858
as well as Korean.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.259
He's an opportunist,
not a racist.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.995
He may just live
in the neighborhood.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.629
The latest
carjacking victim

12:09.696 --> 12:11.331
helped us develop
a new sketch.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.304
Let's get this
out to the public.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.774
Not a good idea, sir.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.176
We'll be overwhelmed
with false sightings.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.479
We'll keep it close,
circulate it internally.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.981
It's your call.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.486
Soon you won't have to sit
through any more of these.

12:33.553 --> 12:34.922
How's that?

12:34.988 --> 12:37.290
The short list
is getting shorter.

12:37.357 --> 12:40.961
Bradley Walker wants
Nestor Delgado.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.137
No comment?
You don't care?

12:54.141 --> 12:55.608
I don't know
where to start.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.910
Delgado?

12:56.977 --> 12:59.246
He's young. He's smart.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.049
One of ours. Came up
through the ranks.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.184
A rising star
in the department.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.054
Thanks to friends in high
places like Walker.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.989
He's a climber, not a cop.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.724
Plus he's green. He doesn't
know what he doesn't know.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.994
He's not my first choice,

13:14.061 --> 13:15.228
- but--
- Besides, I thought

13:15.295 --> 13:16.964
you couldn't
appoint a Latino.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.165
That was before the election.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.933
Now I can do whatever
the fuck I want.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.334
And you want Delgado?

13:21.401 --> 13:22.569
Walker does,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.905
and the rest of the
commission will go along.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.540
You're playing me, Hector.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.844
You know damn well
Delgado is not a good choice.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.784
I want you, Irv.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.020
But if you won't
take the job--

13:57.470 --> 14:00.073
Grab those drinks
for me, will you?

14:02.009 --> 14:03.443
Sharkey's mother?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.945
Blames herself.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.246
Do me a favor.
Let her know

14:06.313 --> 14:07.915
about the Victims
Assistance Fund

14:07.981 --> 14:10.217
- for the funeral costs.
- Done.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.319
Gentlemen, this is
Detective Bosch.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.821
He wants to ask you
a few questions.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.690
Taco Supreme
was Sharkey's jam.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.526
Hey, respect, man.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.500
Sorry about your friend.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.070
Sure you are.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.239
Last time you saw Sharkey,

14:32.305 --> 14:33.941
you were running
your flimflam, right?

14:35.475 --> 14:37.377
Now we can cut you
some slack on that,

14:37.444 --> 14:39.512
but we need to know
what happened that night.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.081
Anything you can tell us?

14:44.617 --> 14:46.086
Car he got into?

14:47.988 --> 14:49.022
Black Beemer.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.857
Fuck.
What the fuck, man?

14:50.924 --> 14:53.026
There you go.
You do know something.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.261
There's only about a million

14:54.327 --> 14:55.795
of those douche-y cars
around here.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.497
Did you make the driver?

14:59.032 --> 15:00.633
Couldn't really see him.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.303
It was with
tinted windows.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.473
Tall? Short? Black?
White? Anything?

15:08.875 --> 15:11.111
This is how
you do your friend?

15:16.483 --> 15:17.517
Look at this.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.587
Aw, shit.

15:20.653 --> 15:21.688
I don't want to see that.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.755
Look at this.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.591
This is him,

15:24.657 --> 15:25.692
killed like an animal,

15:25.758 --> 15:27.094
and you play dumb?

15:31.364 --> 15:33.967
I can kind of picture
the dude in my head.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.702
I'm not sure
how to describe him.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.936
Then don't,
motherfucker.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.205
Keep your
fucking mouth shut.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.273
Take this punk back
to West Hollywood

15:40.340 --> 15:42.342
and drop him on the street.

15:42.409 --> 15:43.743
Our pleasure.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.845
Give me that.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.747
I'm going to show you
some photos, okay?

15:47.814 --> 15:49.549
Go ahead.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.285
The driver may or may
not be in the pictures.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.687
I don't want you to feel
like you got to pick one.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.964
Maybe this one right here.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.702
And him.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.571
You sure?

16:13.573 --> 16:14.641
Could have been.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.209
I'll use a security guy

16:16.276 --> 16:17.844
to establish
when Donatella arrived

16:17.910 --> 16:20.047
and when Holland left
and came back that night.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.481
The missing 20 minutes.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.482
Which will contradict

16:22.549 --> 16:24.251
his original statement
to the detectives.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.685
When he was
staging the scene.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.655
Mm-hmm. After
the security guy,
the DNA evidence.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.490
Defense will say
the sex was consensual.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.225
And we'll say
that Donatella thought

16:32.292 --> 16:34.027
she was engaging
in consensual sex,

16:34.094 --> 16:35.828
but Holland had intended
to kill her all along.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.730
Intention.
It's a high bar.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.101
Annabelle Crowe
will testify

16:41.168 --> 16:43.936
how he choked her during sex
until she passed out

16:44.003 --> 16:45.805
and how his actions afterwards

16:45.872 --> 16:47.207
indicate
he thought she was dead.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.909
He was prepared
to get rid of her body.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.178
Excellent.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.846
That establishes his
homicidal proclivities,

16:53.913 --> 16:55.682
the premeditation--

16:59.819 --> 17:01.721
Is there a problem?

17:01.788 --> 17:03.156
She's nervous.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.494
Shit.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.995
How nervous?

17:09.062 --> 17:10.897
Holland's people
let her know

17:10.963 --> 17:12.899
that they know
she works as an escort.

17:12.965 --> 17:14.834
Witness intimidation?

17:14.901 --> 17:16.236
I don't think
it rises to that.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.138
As far as we know,
they haven't threatened her.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.707
When did you
speak to her last?

17:22.209 --> 17:23.676
Bosch is staying
in touch with her.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.347
It's not going to be
a problem.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.556
Word to the wise, Anita.

17:36.623 --> 17:37.890
Anything other

17:37.957 --> 17:40.327
than a professional
relationship

17:40.393 --> 17:41.694
with Detective Bosch...

17:42.929 --> 17:44.531
is a bad idea.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.768
And not my style.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.349
Careful.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.483
Might be an IA sting.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.686
IA's after you,
pal, not me.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.188
Obviously this is mine.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.556
Fell out of my pocket.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.790
If you say so.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.227
What you got there?

18:16.796 --> 18:18.965
Autopsy notes on Sharkey.

18:19.031 --> 18:22.001
Wounds indicate the weapon
had a curved blade,

18:22.068 --> 18:24.704
3 inches from tip to hilt.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.975
And the car Sharkey got
into on Saturday night,

18:29.041 --> 18:31.344
one of his boys thinks maybe
Xavi Moreno was driving.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.146
Might not be enough
for a warrant.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.848
But enough to go
rattle his cage.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.556
Coming?

18:44.757 --> 18:45.725
Am I invited?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.161
You can thank Robertson.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.330
Why Robertson?

18:50.397 --> 18:52.232
For being an even bigger
asshole than you are.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.705
Follow me.

19:00.940 --> 19:01.974
Looks like fun.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.010
They explode
without warning.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.645
I wasn't talking
about the board.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.679
Neither was I.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.363
Jerry.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.201
No curved blades.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.702
That would have
been too easy.

19:30.803 --> 19:31.871
You're in my backyard.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.172
- You take it.
- Got it.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.243
LAPD. Xavier Moreno?

19:36.309 --> 19:37.877
Sí, señor.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.346
I wanted to ask you
a question

19:39.412 --> 19:41.248
about this photograph.

19:42.215 --> 19:44.484
Hmm. Yeah? So?

19:44.551 --> 19:46.219
Trevor Dobbs says
you worked for him.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.455
That was another life.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.922
You don't work
for him anymore?

19:49.989 --> 19:51.190
Why would I want
to work for him

19:51.258 --> 19:54.060
when I got all this?
When I got her?

19:54.126 --> 19:56.263
Billy Meadows--

19:56.329 --> 19:57.864
when did you see him last?

19:57.930 --> 20:01.968
I don't know. Maybe when
that picture was taken.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.169
Too bad about Billy, huh?

20:03.236 --> 20:04.804
What do you fish?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.973
Shark. Mako, thresher.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.308
I run charters.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.209
Overnights
with weekend warriors

20:10.277 --> 20:11.478
out of Newport
and Huntington.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.879
That where you were
Saturday night? Charter?

20:12.945 --> 20:14.314
Nah. Date night.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.648
Zankou Chicken

20:15.715 --> 20:17.817
- and then--
- From when to when?

20:17.884 --> 20:18.951
Eating or fucking?

20:21.053 --> 20:23.089
6 p.m. until ai, papi.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.657
So that's what, 6:15?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.626
Ha-ha. Funny man.
Midnight.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.362
- Midnight?
- Mm-hmm. She'll tell you.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.130
About the same time
the street kid

20:31.197 --> 20:32.599
was stabbed to death
in Hollywood.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.434
Shit happens in Hollywood.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.002
We've been talking to him
about Billy Meadows' murder.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.338
No shit.
He was a suspect?

20:38.405 --> 20:40.407
- Witness.
- Ah.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.974
He was there that night.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.209
Bad luck for you, huh?

20:43.276 --> 20:45.478
Killer knew his way
around a blade.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.046
Hit this kid's bleeders.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.448
You must know the move--

20:48.515 --> 20:50.450
two cuts across the neck
down the shoulder.

20:50.517 --> 20:53.453
Serious move, brother.
Ever try it for real?

20:53.520 --> 20:54.521
You?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.556
That move,
when it's done right--

20:56.623 --> 20:57.890
Tell me.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.258
No artery spray.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.961
None of that movie bullshit.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.631
You could be 5 feet away
and not know what happened.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.933
Turn around,
guy's on the ground

21:06.999 --> 21:09.235
bleeding out.
Nothing you can do.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.170
Exactly what happened
to our witness.

21:11.237 --> 21:12.238
You want to test my knives?

21:12.305 --> 21:13.373
In time.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.308
Get a warrant.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.444
And have at it.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.549
Mamacita.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.317
- I like him for it.
- No doubt.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.485
Think he still
has the weapon?

21:25.552 --> 21:26.686
If he does, he bleached it.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.321
Nah. Crate and Barrell
are gone.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.790
Clue the video.
Maybe explain to Pop.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.259
You sure you want all of it?

21:33.326 --> 21:34.561
Happy to share.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.095
Every frame.
Put it on that.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.229
I'll watch it tonight.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.598
You understand what this is.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.433
This is surveillance
footage of a street corner,

21:40.500 --> 21:41.534
hours and hours of it.

21:41.601 --> 21:42.769
I got nothing but time.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.070
Mmm.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.171
Don't start.

21:45.237 --> 21:46.773
And a thousand
tiny violins

21:46.839 --> 21:48.675
- begin to play.
- Fuck your mother.

21:48.741 --> 21:52.745
It's a sad,
sad song, brother.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.847
That the Gunn
murder book?

21:54.914 --> 21:56.315
Yeah. You need it?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.659
No. Don't open it.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.394
I'll look
when I get home.

22:42.328 --> 22:44.096
All right.
Love you, Lis'.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.270
Anderson?

22:51.337 --> 22:52.371
Done.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.040
That story's dead.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.011
Fresh look.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.681
Well, can't hurt.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.794
Grace Billets.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.567
Shit.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.316
Your wife know you're here?

24:10.382 --> 24:11.718
Oh, my wife
knows everything.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.754
That's too bad.
What can I do for you?

24:14.821 --> 24:16.222
I'm still trying
to find that guy

24:16.288 --> 24:17.456
who came here
with Eddie Gunn.

24:17.524 --> 24:20.059
Seems like a long
time ago now.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.029
Why don't you have
a look-see in here?

24:27.166 --> 24:29.401
That's that director,
the one who killed that girl.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.737
It wasn't him.
I'd remember.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.105
And what about this guy?

24:33.172 --> 24:35.141
Ah, no.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.643
He's hunky, though.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.579
One more?

24:43.516 --> 24:45.184
Three time's a charm.

24:48.254 --> 24:49.922
No. Sorry.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.058
That it?

24:52.124 --> 24:53.225
For now.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.195
Thanks, Janice.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.997
You're welcome, detective.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.266
What's your name?

25:01.701 --> 25:02.969
Robertson.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.204
Got a first name?

25:06.573 --> 25:08.274
Santiago.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.042
But everyone calls me Jimmy.

25:10.109 --> 25:13.212
Okay, then, Santiago.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.513
See you around.

25:16.415 --> 25:17.717
Yep.

25:44.611 --> 25:46.746
Coach says I'm good enough
to play on the travel team.

25:46.813 --> 25:48.648
Can you make it so I can
see what they're doing?

25:48.715 --> 25:50.316
Coach says it'll look
good on my college apps.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.350
Scholarships,

25:51.417 --> 25:52.384
hello.

25:52.451 --> 25:53.620
Your travel team, I heard you.

25:53.686 --> 25:54.887
It's only on
the weekends.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.522
I won't miss any school.
Don't worry.

25:56.589 --> 25:57.857
You got that right.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.460
- How's that?
- Can you zoom in?

26:01.527 --> 26:02.729
Sure.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.299
Nice. Gracias.

26:07.366 --> 26:08.567
De nada.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.970
You really want to
give up your weekends?

26:11.037 --> 26:12.138
I'd miss you.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.840
You mean when you
and Anita aren't working?

26:13.906 --> 26:16.275
Really? I'll discuss it
with your mother.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.877
Cool. Homework.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.778
Xavi.

26:52.645 --> 26:53.612
Captain.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.882
I understand
you had a visit.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.416
Just chumming the waters.

26:57.483 --> 26:58.550
And that's how
shit surfaces.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.719
If they had anything,

26:59.786 --> 27:02.021
they'd have come
with a warrant.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.255
South Bay?

27:03.322 --> 27:04.156
On my way.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.324
Take Woody with you.

27:06.525 --> 27:07.593
What?

27:07.660 --> 27:09.461
Look, I'd rather solo,
Captain.

27:09.528 --> 27:12.131
He's baked
all day every day.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.700
Useless.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.968
Less me, more we,
Moreno.

27:16.836 --> 27:17.770
Who was it took out

27:17.837 --> 27:19.271
Abdul Ghazni
in Kandahar?

27:19.338 --> 27:20.606
We did.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.174
- The three of us.
- Yes, sir.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.344
Thanksgiving's coming.

27:25.411 --> 27:26.879
If we keep our shit
together,

27:26.946 --> 27:29.148
we're all gonna have
a lot to be thankful for.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.673
Hey, Pierce.

27:54.741 --> 27:55.908
Hey.

27:56.909 --> 27:57.944
What's all this?

27:58.010 --> 27:59.912
Fresh eyes on Gunn.

27:59.979 --> 28:01.447
Robertson's
working some angle.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.649
- Oh, yeah? Why?
- I'm not sure.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.818
He doesn't exactly
keep me up to speed.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.754
Any usable prints
from Gunn's?

28:07.820 --> 28:09.722
Just Gunn's.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.259
So go back. Redo it.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.560
Reprint Gunn's apartment.

28:14.626 --> 28:15.795
I can do that?

28:15.862 --> 28:17.496
Shit, yeah.
It's your case, too.

28:17.563 --> 28:18.765
Yeah, but shouldn't I--

28:18.831 --> 28:20.266
But have Potter do it.
He's the best.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.434
Have him recheck everything
at point of entry.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.771
Look small, find big.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.240
Better make sure
that thing's waterproof.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.743
That bitch Benitez.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.145
I mean, I can't even
use my own hot tub?

28:33.212 --> 28:35.081
Cruel and unusual punishment.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.983
You need to eat
something, Mr. H.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.584
Want me to make
your protein shake?

28:38.650 --> 28:40.086
Would you, Marissa?
You're a lifesaver.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.521
What about you,
Mr. Fowkkes? Rudy?

28:42.588 --> 28:43.689
Not for me.

28:43.756 --> 28:45.357
No, thanks.

28:45.424 --> 28:46.893
Feeling a little queasy.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.427
I can get you
something else.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.029
Maybe a bigger towel.

28:52.765 --> 28:55.802
Annabelle Crowe is not
going to be a problem.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.303
You're certain?

28:57.369 --> 29:01.808
100%. She's been receptive
to our inducements.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.777
The offer didn't come
from us directly.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.345
Uh, a third party.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.247
She has no idea.

29:08.314 --> 29:09.115
Couldn't believe it.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.250
Just a stroke
of good fortune.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.819
Excellent.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.455
What about Bosch?

29:16.522 --> 29:17.790
We're ready
to go after him

29:17.857 --> 29:19.258
in social media.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.327
Level of interest
in your case, Andrew,

29:21.393 --> 29:22.628
is, uh, quite high.

29:22.694 --> 29:23.996
My publicist could help.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.532
Again, this cannot look
like it came from us.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.272
All right.

29:34.373 --> 29:37.243
Tell me the story
you came up with.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.112
Just the slug line.

29:40.179 --> 29:43.115
Movie-of-the-week detective
becomes murder suspect.

29:43.182 --> 29:46.919
Oh, come on, it's tired.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.488
Don't you think?

29:49.555 --> 29:51.657
A bit dull.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.392
I'm open to suggestions,
Andrew.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.828
Oh, don't get your panties
in a twist, J.R.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.697
I don't expect you
to be a creative.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.269
What about...

30:04.837 --> 30:07.506
hashtag
down and dirty detective?

30:09.608 --> 30:10.709
Now that's click bait.

30:10.776 --> 30:11.944
Fucking perfect.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.712
I always say you're
a genius, Andrew.

30:13.779 --> 30:14.981
One of the few directors

30:15.047 --> 30:16.883
worthy of the appellation
"auteur."

30:16.949 --> 30:19.451
All right, now let's
not overdo it, J.R.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.120
What?

30:21.187 --> 30:22.421
Mr. H.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.957
Thank you, Marissa.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.431
Mm.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.900
Mm.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.603
Ah.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.940
Anyone care to join me?

30:41.007 --> 30:43.375
Maybe he's
overcompensating.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.576
You think?

31:01.693 --> 31:03.129
Zankou Chicken.

31:04.897 --> 31:05.898
I'm not hungry.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.433
It's a peace offering.

31:07.499 --> 31:11.170
Jerry, you can't
bribe me with fast food.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.871
What did
the counter guy say?

31:12.939 --> 31:14.506
Remembers the girl.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.775
I get that. Xavi Moreno?

31:16.842 --> 31:17.876
Not so much.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.178
- Video?
- No.

31:20.412 --> 31:21.647
Some alibi.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.150
Aye Papi. I was thinking.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.952
How could he afford
to live in that zip code

31:26.018 --> 31:27.453
running weekend charters?

31:27.519 --> 31:29.989
Maybe he's selling
shark fins to Asia.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.558
I had Sacciano do
a financial workup

31:32.624 --> 31:36.362
this past April to October--
Dobbs, Marino, and Woodrow

31:36.428 --> 31:39.298
were on payroll of a company
called A4 Dynamics.

31:39.365 --> 31:41.000
A4 Dynamics.
What is that?

31:41.067 --> 31:42.368
I'm still working on that.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.536
My bet, it's a shell
company for Dobbs Corp.

31:44.603 --> 31:48.240
Copies of Dobbs'
credit card statements...

31:49.208 --> 31:51.710
for April and October.

31:51.777 --> 31:54.080
The highlighted charges.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.550
DXB.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.286
Dubai International.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.154
Duty-free.

32:36.688 --> 32:37.923
At your service, ladies.

32:37.990 --> 32:38.991
You made it.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.926
So move on over.

32:40.993 --> 32:43.495
- Let me get in here.
- Okay.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.397
So here's what I got.

32:52.504 --> 32:53.672
Sorry I'm late.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.708
Like an idiot, I thought
I would just nip onto the 405

32:56.775 --> 32:58.077
and take the 10,

32:58.144 --> 33:00.712
and La Brea was all
backed up, of course.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.414
What a nightmare.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.749
Well,
don't worry about it.

33:03.815 --> 33:04.950
Connie's not here
yet, either.

33:05.017 --> 33:07.419
How are you, Irv?

33:07.486 --> 33:08.920
Ready for this part
to be over.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.090
Almost there.
Today should be simple.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.592
It's a lot easier when there
are no children involved.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.831
Minor children, I meant.

33:19.898 --> 33:21.500
I know.

33:23.135 --> 33:25.404
Get my message
about your pension?

33:25.471 --> 33:26.472
Yeah.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.174
Look, I just feel

33:28.240 --> 33:30.709
that Connie's entitled
to her fair share.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.778
Your next wife
might disagree.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.081
Fat chance.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.682
Life goes on, Irv.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.050
A man like you--

33:38.117 --> 33:39.618
especially
for a man like you

33:39.685 --> 33:40.786
in your position--

33:40.852 --> 33:42.754
I don't see that happening.

33:44.556 --> 33:45.491
Hello, Irv.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.427
Craig.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.662
Good to see you.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.698
Where's Connie?

33:53.765 --> 33:55.033
Uh, she's not coming.

33:55.101 --> 33:59.004
Uh, she's given me
power of attorney.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.772
We still have
things to discuss.

34:00.839 --> 34:04.009
She said yes to
everything you asked for.

34:04.076 --> 34:06.745
She's not contesting
anything.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.414
All we need
is your signature,

34:08.480 --> 34:10.349
and, uh, this will be done.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.718
We'll get it filed today.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.389
Good?

34:21.393 --> 34:22.594
Fine.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.804
Irv.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.140
Wait.

34:36.342 --> 34:39.878
Look, I didn't mean
to, uh, ambush you,

34:39.945 --> 34:42.648
but Connie didn't want me
to tell you ahead of time.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.015
Why?

34:44.082 --> 34:47.186
Uh, she's tired
of talking about it.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.189
She just wants
to move on.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.527
How is she?

34:55.594 --> 34:56.895
She's good.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.864
You know, doing well.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.033
It helps to have family.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.836
Yes, it does.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.772
Are you in touch
with yours?

35:06.838 --> 35:08.240
I am.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.342
That's good. Good.

35:11.843 --> 35:12.911
All right, then.

35:12.978 --> 35:15.381
Uh, best of luck.

35:16.615 --> 35:17.583
Craig, uh...

35:18.450 --> 35:20.452
Well, you have my number

35:20.519 --> 35:22.754
if you ever want to play
a round or catch a game.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.089
Absolutely.

35:24.156 --> 35:26.825
Uh, take care
of yourself, all right?

35:26.892 --> 35:28.093
I will. You, too.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.328
Yeah.

35:40.005 --> 35:42.107
Hey, Bosch.

35:42.174 --> 35:43.875
Thanks for meeting me
out here.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.143
You're doing me
a solid.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.478
Anything to get
out of that office

35:46.545 --> 35:48.280
and loosen up
the damn monkey suit.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.748
I think I got what you need.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.883
Captain Trevor Dobbs
and company.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.051
Right.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.186
They arrived Dubai

35:54.253 --> 35:55.454
April 20 of this year.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.456
Nonstop flight
Jet Blue out of LAX.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.057
They returned
back to the States

35:59.124 --> 36:00.726
the same way October 7.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.194
And in between?

36:02.261 --> 36:05.297
A six-hour layover
in which they visited

36:05.364 --> 36:07.533
the Dubai international
duty-free

36:07.599 --> 36:10.702
and bought copious amounts
of cigarettes and alcohol.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.472
Then they jump on
the Safi Airlines
flight to Kabul.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.375
Hot damn Afghanistan.

36:16.442 --> 36:17.743
Turns out they're
frequent flyers.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.845
They were just there
the year before.

36:19.911 --> 36:23.315
And FYI, William Meadows
was with them that time

36:23.382 --> 36:24.716
but not this last one.

36:24.783 --> 36:27.085
Meadows couldn't pass
the physical, Dobbs said.

36:27.152 --> 36:28.387
What's the attraction?

36:28.454 --> 36:29.688
I mean, why go back so soon?

36:29.755 --> 36:33.525
Ohh. Afghanistan
does have its charms.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.395
They were lost on me.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.931
Copy that.

36:46.071 --> 36:48.039
Detective.

36:48.106 --> 36:49.608
Sorry.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.711
- I know how they got in.
- How?

36:53.712 --> 36:55.581
There's a faint
abrasion pattern

36:55.647 --> 36:57.349
along the edge of the door.

36:57.416 --> 36:58.884
Probably fishing line,

36:58.950 --> 37:00.452
maybe monofilament.

37:02.388 --> 37:03.555
Any prints?

37:10.462 --> 37:12.097
Maybe tomorrow morning

37:12.163 --> 37:13.665
I'll cruise by the Marina.

37:13.732 --> 37:14.900
Can't hurt.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.001
What do you think it is?

37:16.067 --> 37:17.403
O'Shea thinks
drugs or cash,

37:17.469 --> 37:18.870
maybe antiquities.

37:18.937 --> 37:20.572
A jeep full of gold.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.374
You are hung up on that Jeep.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.410
I just can't stop
thinking about it.

37:24.476 --> 37:26.345
In my mind
it's a solid gold jeep.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.713
Whatever it is,

37:27.779 --> 37:29.615
this last time,
they left Meadows behind.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.351
Doing dope,
running his mouth.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.953
He'd gone to pieces,
so they shut him up.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.021
Sharkey, too.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.390
Yeah. Sharkey.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.158
Wrong place, wrong time.

37:40.225 --> 37:41.460
Bad luck.

37:42.794 --> 37:43.995
His whole life.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.024
Well, good on Maddie.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.593
The coach wants her
to join the travel team.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.928
Do a workup on him?

39:22.994 --> 39:24.029
No.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.030
Why not?

39:25.096 --> 39:26.131
The coach is a woman.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.534
So? Do it. Trust me.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.870
So when do you hear
about the captain's exam?

39:31.937 --> 39:32.971
I heard.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.941
Next to last band.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.142
Gonna die on that list.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.111
Shit. Sorry.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.147
What happened?

39:42.213 --> 39:43.482
Kiz.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.116
I mean,
I can't prove it, but--

39:46.952 --> 39:48.554
Well, you can take it
again in two years.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.121
It'll be ancient history.

39:50.188 --> 39:51.723
No, no, no, no.
I'm done.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.526
You know what?
The truth is

39:54.593 --> 39:56.227
I think I wanted
to make captain

39:56.294 --> 39:58.396
more than I wanted
to actually be one.

39:58.464 --> 40:01.166
But I'm happy
where I am

40:01.232 --> 40:02.734
with you assholes.

40:04.202 --> 40:05.336
Where you belong.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.404
That's right.

40:06.472 --> 40:08.507
To my assholes.

40:12.778 --> 40:15.013
I think that toast
was probably a first.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.455
It's been a rough one
for you.

40:24.823 --> 40:26.057
That tunnel vision you get

40:26.124 --> 40:27.993
- when you work a case, right?
- Sure.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.598
I didn't pay attention.

40:32.664 --> 40:35.000
I didn't protect my witness.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.436
Now that boy's
going home the wrong way.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.172
I keep telling you.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.642
It's not your fault,
Harry.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.110
I mean, it isn't.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.558
- Wow. Look who it is.
- Rhodes.

40:59.625 --> 41:00.959
How's life
in the fast lane?

41:01.026 --> 41:02.027
Beats humping a shamu.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.228
I'll bet.
Nice murse.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.596
Real Corinthian
leather?

41:10.636 --> 41:12.237
Who told you
to reprint the scene?

41:12.303 --> 41:14.139
My idea.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.774
Your idea or Bosch's?

41:18.076 --> 41:19.545
Son of a bitch.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.446
Look, Jimmy,
it's my case, too.

41:21.513 --> 41:24.215
I needed to do something
besides research bezels
and watch bands.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.185
- Fair enough.
- So?

41:28.319 --> 41:29.588
LT thinks it's a frame

41:29.655 --> 41:31.557
and Andrew Holland's
behind it.

41:31.623 --> 41:32.658
What do you think?

41:32.724 --> 41:34.325
Maybe. Or maybe

41:34.392 --> 41:36.728
Bosch killed Gunn
and designed this
fucked up frame

41:36.795 --> 41:37.929
to throw shit on Holland.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.097
No way.

41:42.433 --> 41:44.402
You don't know,
young blood.

41:44.469 --> 41:46.437
You don't know.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.673
Never assume.

41:49.474 --> 41:50.909
Why would Bosch do that?

41:50.976 --> 41:52.443
He takes two assholes
off the board

41:52.510 --> 41:54.279
with one move.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.480
He gets Gunn,

41:55.547 --> 41:56.982
and Holland
goes down, too.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.818
But here's the thing.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.554
I don't know
who killed Gunn yet,

42:02.621 --> 42:05.190
but I know Bosch is
lying about something.

42:05.256 --> 42:08.059
He's hiding something.
I can smell it.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.132
So what do we do?

42:14.199 --> 42:15.233
We start over.

42:18.203 --> 42:19.304
Look at everything
again.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.772
From the beginning?

42:20.839 --> 42:22.273
Hey.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.042
We're way ahead
of the game.

42:24.109 --> 42:26.678
Some smart ass already
had the scene reprinted.

42:28.313 --> 42:30.548
- Got some quality lifts, too.
- Oh, yeah.

42:40.525 --> 42:42.327
Hey, you know what?

42:42.393 --> 42:44.095
Why don't you take this one?

42:47.666 --> 42:49.100
Edward James Gunn.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.236
You bailed him out of
the Rampart drunk tank

42:51.302 --> 42:52.638
about two weeks ago.

42:52.704 --> 42:54.673
Girl said she needed
to get this fella out.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.942
Asked me to handle it,
so I did.

42:57.008 --> 42:59.244
Can you pull your copy
of her I.D.?

42:59.310 --> 43:00.812
Didn't make a copy.

43:00.879 --> 43:03.114
So there are no papers
on this?

43:03.181 --> 43:04.683
Of course there is.

43:04.750 --> 43:07.152
Been doing this job
a long time.

43:09.454 --> 43:11.122
We obey the law here.

43:14.893 --> 43:16.261
I can't read
this signature.

43:16.327 --> 43:17.362
Tough titty.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.731
Hey. Respect.

43:19.798 --> 43:22.100
What can I tell you?

43:22.167 --> 43:25.436
She showed me I.D.
She signed the form.

43:25.503 --> 43:26.537
She paid the bond.

43:26.604 --> 43:27.605
How'd she pay?

43:27.673 --> 43:28.774
Cash.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.375
She paid
cash on the barrel.

43:30.441 --> 43:31.509
What did she look like?

43:31.576 --> 43:34.612
Young,
dark hair, dark eyes.

43:34.680 --> 43:35.647
Hispanic.

43:35.714 --> 43:37.482
Latina.

43:37.548 --> 43:38.717
She was Spanish.

43:38.784 --> 43:40.251
She speaks Spanish?

43:40.318 --> 43:43.121
How would I know?
We talk English in here.

43:43.188 --> 43:45.323
Are you fucking with me,
asshole?

43:50.161 --> 43:53.231
Anybody else been in here
asking about this?

43:53.298 --> 43:55.200
As a matter of fact...

43:58.269 --> 43:59.637
last week.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.810
Bosch.

44:55.393 --> 44:56.361
Here you go.

45:01.967 --> 45:03.034
You have a good day, sir.

45:03.101 --> 45:05.170
Abso-fucking-lutely, Popeye.

45:23.654 --> 45:24.790
You seen this?

45:24.856 --> 45:26.724
No. What?

45:26.792 --> 45:28.059
Search Twitter.

45:28.126 --> 45:30.595
Hashtag DDD or hashtag 3D.

45:30.661 --> 45:32.463
Hashtag DDD?

45:32.530 --> 45:33.698
What is that?

45:33.765 --> 45:35.500
The Edward Gunn murder.

45:35.566 --> 45:36.935
The story
you backed off of

45:37.002 --> 45:39.004
about an LAPD officer
being a suspect.

45:39.070 --> 45:40.305
"Down and dirty
detective."

45:40.371 --> 45:42.774
Blogger at Witness L.A.
picked it up,

45:42.841 --> 45:44.109
- Now it's everywhere.
- Shit.

45:44.175 --> 45:45.811
It's on the Huffington Post.

45:45.877 --> 45:47.813
You said it was a nonstory.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.180
It was. It is.

45:49.247 --> 45:50.916
You got played.

45:55.954 --> 45:57.088
Grace wants everybody

45:57.155 --> 45:58.957
to bring a couple of sides.

45:59.024 --> 46:02.060
I was thinking biscuits,
mac and cheese.

46:02.127 --> 46:03.694
Mac and cheese
sounds good.

46:03.761 --> 46:06.697
I'm kidding.
It sounds horrible.

46:06.764 --> 46:09.334
Sweet potatoes
with marshmallow crust.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.468
Sounds horrible.

46:10.535 --> 46:12.403
Yeah, but it tastes good.

46:16.307 --> 46:18.476
Annabelle, she's not
returning my calls.

46:18.543 --> 46:22.480
Maybe it's the holiday.
She's gone home to Mama.

46:22.547 --> 46:25.350
I told O'Shea
she'd testify.

46:25.416 --> 46:26.651
You what?

46:26.717 --> 46:28.286
I more or less
guaranteed it.

46:28.353 --> 46:29.787
I thought you were
going to tell him

46:29.855 --> 46:31.156
she changed her mind.

46:31.222 --> 46:33.158
I was hoping you'd take
another crack at her.

46:33.224 --> 46:36.327
You're very persuasive
when you want to be.

46:36.394 --> 46:38.229
Okay, I'll do it Friday.

46:38.296 --> 46:41.432
If we lose her,
at least we've got you.

46:48.773 --> 46:49.975
Ahh.

46:50.041 --> 46:52.377
Let's see it, boys,
let's see it.

46:52.443 --> 46:53.544
Fuck.

46:57.015 --> 46:59.450
Shit.

46:59.517 --> 47:01.252
Ohh.

47:01.319 --> 47:02.854
Yeah, baby.

47:03.922 --> 47:05.623
Oh, that is fucking pretty.

47:06.691 --> 47:09.127
That's amore. Ha ha!
