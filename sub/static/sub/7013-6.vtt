00:05.271 --> 00:08.035
Okay. So, is everyone ready...

00:08.108 --> 00:10.804
for our big trip to
the University of Wisconsin?

00:10.877 --> 00:14.870
Yeah, Donna and I have it all mapped out.
<i>She</i> is going to buy a tight sweater...

00:14.948 --> 00:18.145
with a big, red ''W'' on it,
and <i>I</i> am going to watch her wear it.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.448
( Laughs )

00:21.588 --> 00:24.148
And then we're gonna buckle down.

00:24.224 --> 00:27.990
Oh, Steven, I put out some clean clothes
for you to take on the trip.

00:28.061 --> 00:31.519
Uh, thanks, Mrs. Forman,
but I'm not really the college type.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.532
I get my learnin' on the street.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.297
Steven, you're a smart kid.
If you would only just apply yourself...

00:37.370 --> 00:41.397
-you could go to college too.
- You don't trust me alone in the house, do you?

00:41.474 --> 00:43.669
See how smart you are?

00:43.743 --> 00:47.042
Well, I just can't believe
my baby is...

00:47.113 --> 00:50.844
all grown up and...
visiting college!

00:50.917 --> 00:53.579
I am so <i>freakin'</i> old!

00:56.089 --> 00:59.923
And menopause makes another unwelcome
appearance at the dinner table.

00:59.993 --> 01:03.827
Oh, no, it's not unwelcome.
It's- It's liberating.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.627
Now my emotions just spill out.

01:06.699 --> 01:10.567
Yeah, Mom. You're sweating
all over your pork chop.

01:10.637 --> 01:14.334
Hey! There's my favorite coed.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.932
- Hey, are you all packed for Visitors Weekend?
- I can't go.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.103
My dad's makin' me visit
Marquette instead.

01:19.179 --> 01:21.340
He thinks it's a better school,
'cause it's private.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.575
Oh, and 'cause it sounds French.

01:24.984 --> 01:27.748
Well, you know what?

01:27.821 --> 01:29.982
We'll just go with you.
I mean, if it's a better school...

01:30.056 --> 01:31.990
then I belong there too, right, Dad?

01:32.058 --> 01:34.652
No.

01:34.727 --> 01:38.891
State schools are cheap.
That's where you belong.

01:38.965 --> 01:42.128
Well, what if, like, you took out
a second mortgage on the house?

01:42.202 --> 01:45.103

I have a bad feeling about this weekend, Eric.

02:33.453 --> 02:36.547
Nothing good can come from us
visiting different schools.

02:36.623 --> 02:39.023
Well, yeah, but there's an upside.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.083
Two days apart? I mean,
when we get together...

02:41.161 --> 02:43.129
it's gonna be electric, baby!

02:45.732 --> 02:48.223
Like a thunderstorm.

02:48.301 --> 02:50.235
Eric, I'm serious!

02:50.303 --> 02:52.828
I mean, what if we actually end
up going to different colleges?

02:52.906 --> 02:55.397
And we're apart for four years?

02:55.475 --> 02:59.275
Then, come semester break, you
better board up your windows.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.746
'Cause guess what?
Here comes Hurricane Eric.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.683
Board up my windows?
What are my windows?

03:07.754 --> 03:11.690
- And whatever they are,
wouldn't you want them open?
- Hmm.

03:11.758 --> 03:15.455
Look, Donna. All I'm saying is that
I think we can get through anything.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.496
We go to different schools
now, and we're fine...

03:17.564 --> 03:21.330
because our love is strong.

03:21.401 --> 03:24.393
Like a big, burly bear.

03:26.172 --> 03:28.163
So zip up your tent,
'cause guess what.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.869
This bear has claws.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.072
- Again, wouldn't you want my tent open?
- Mmm.

03:38.585 --> 03:42.214
Hold it, you two.
Now, before we hit the road...

03:42.288 --> 03:46.019
we need to have a talk about that
horrible thing that's taken over your mother.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.494
You mean, her ''change of life''?

03:51.564 --> 03:54.499

''the lady-parts problem.''

03:56.502 --> 03:59.665

03:59.739 --> 04:02.264
Now, we're dealing
with a tricky enemy here.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.937
I haven't been
this frosty since Korea.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.207
And just like a commie...

04:08.281 --> 04:12.650
it can jump out
and attack you at any moment.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.653
- <i>( Kitty ) Red, honey.!</i>
- Incoming!

I've been a tad bit moody lately.

04:24.864 --> 04:27.731

So, um...

04:27.800 --> 04:30.030
if you don't want me to
go on this trip, I'll understand.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.368
Well, you know, honey,
there's really no need for you to go.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.101
I <i>knew</i> you didn't want me to go!

04:38.244 --> 04:41.873
Well, I am going,
whether you like it or not.

04:41.948 --> 04:46.214
Why is it so damn hot in here?

04:46.286 --> 04:50.245
It's like it's-
It's like we're living in hell!

04:51.491 --> 04:54.358
You can say that again.

04:56.763 --> 04:59.755
So, Steven? When I go to Marquette
with Donna this weekend...

04:59.832 --> 05:02.266
there'll be lots
of cute boys around.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.565
Lucky you.

05:04.637 --> 05:08.733
Well, unlucky them,
because I won't let them kiss me.

05:08.808 --> 05:12.107
Yeah, that's my promise to you.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.674
Now, I'm not saying you have
to promise me anything.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.878

now would be a good time.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.184
Okay, well,just know...

05:28.294 --> 05:30.524
that I won't be kissing anyone.

Good to know.

That's it?

I'm sorry about our little spat.

05:57.757 --> 06:01.989

What do you want?

06:20.813 --> 06:23.577

pinned to my lapel.

06:30.022 --> 06:34.891
''Dear Red. Mr. Kelso and I are unable
to take Michael to U.W.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.794
Here's $30 so he can go with you.''

06:41.000 --> 06:44.834

- Oh, I bought this ''electronical'' football game.

have to breathe so much.

No more breathing!

07:14.033 --> 07:17.628

at his thunderstorm jokes.

at U.W. will laugh at them.

he called me his girlfriend.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.996
And then this week,
I couldn't even trick him into promising me...

08:28.074 --> 08:30.372
he wouldn't fool around
with someone else.

08:30.443 --> 08:33.434

And you don't know what
she's doin' at Marquette.

14:49.234 --> 14:51.395
Or who.

14:51.470 --> 14:54.268
Man, she said
she wouldn't do anything.

14:54.339 --> 14:59.038
Yeah, but I bet if she did,
you'd cry because you love her.

14:59.111 --> 15:02.842
If you don't shut up, you'll be the first person
to touch his chin to his ass.

15:02.915 --> 15:06.476
Have you been spying on me?

15:06.552 --> 15:10.044
I see U.W. has a pretty good
C.P.R. program.

15:12.491 --> 15:14.686
It's gonna be my major.

15:18.197 --> 15:21.462
So, I told my girlfriend,
''We can go to separate schools.''

15:21.533 --> 15:24.093
- I mean, people do that all the time, right?
- Yeah.

15:24.169 --> 15:27.138
My boyfriend goes to school in New York,
and we've been together for three years.

15:27.206 --> 15:30.505
- And we're in love now more than ever.
- Of course you are.

15:30.576 --> 15:34.603
And I bet when you two get together,
it's like a thunderstorm, right?

15:36.048 --> 15:38.915
Hey, pretty lady.

15:39.918 --> 15:42.546
Hey, excuse me. Hello?

15:42.621 --> 15:46.523
- Didn't you just say you had a boyfriend?
- Yeah. But he's not here.

15:52.097 --> 15:56.466
Did you just see that? I told Donna
we could go to different schools...

15:56.535 --> 15:59.595
and I was
extremely wrong, and-

15:59.671 --> 16:02.401
Man, if she doesn't hate
Marquette, we're screwed.

16:02.474 --> 16:06.103
Who cares, man? I just turned down
a half-drunk college girl.

16:07.246 --> 16:09.942
I'm pretty sure
she knew how to do stuff.

16:13.986 --> 16:16.682
Eric? Is everything okay?

16:16.755 --> 16:20.521
Yeah. Everything's fine. I just wanted
to see how you liked Marquette.

16:20.592 --> 16:24.084
And, can I just say, if that
snooty switchboard operator's attitude...

16:24.162 --> 16:26.323
is any indication of
the Marquette experience, then-

16:26.398 --> 16:29.799
( Chuckles ) I can only assume we're
crossing Marquette off the list right now.

16:29.868 --> 16:32.166
No, actually, it's great.

16:32.237 --> 16:34.171
Okay, they have this
English professor.

16:34.239 --> 16:38.608
He wears a beret and a corduroy jacket,
but he listens to Zeppelin!

16:38.677 --> 16:41.942
Uh, yeah, well, U.W. has
a vending machine, so- ( Scoffing )

16:45.717 --> 16:49.448
- Donna, I love you.
- I love you too. Bye.

16:49.521 --> 16:51.682
( TV Show Theme )

16:52.691 --> 16:54.682
( Sobbing )

16:56.928 --> 16:59.294
You gonna cry now too?

17:00.666 --> 17:05.398
You know who had a real family?
The Waltons.

17:05.470 --> 17:09.770
We're just three strangers
sitting in a room!

17:12.411 --> 17:14.935
- <i>( Door Closes )</i>
- Donna loves it there.

17:15.012 --> 17:17.538
I don't know what to do.

17:17.616 --> 17:19.641
There's nothing any of us can do.

17:19.718 --> 17:21.685
We're all screwed.

17:23.055 --> 17:25.319
You think I like being stuck here...

17:25.390 --> 17:29.417
nursing my lunatic wife
back from the brink?

17:29.494 --> 17:31.519
Hell, no.

17:31.596 --> 17:34.929
But we can't control
what happens to us.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.529
Even if, by some stroke of luck,
you actually hang on to Donna...

17:40.605 --> 17:43.506
eventually, she's gonna
turn into that.

17:45.444 --> 17:49.380
And then,
a few years later, you'll die.

17:53.018 --> 17:56.317
Good. Thanks for the bedtime story.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.792
Donna? I hate it here,
and I want to go home.

18:03.862 --> 18:08.390
Wait, what's wrong? Was there a
height requirement for the cheerleading team?

18:08.467 --> 18:12.460
No, it was awful! And when the cheerleaders
were yelling, ''Go, team, go''...

18:12.537 --> 18:18.032
all I was hearing was Steven saying,
''Good to know. Good to know!''

18:18.110 --> 18:22.479
Jackie, your problem is, is you're always
trying to force people into doing stuff.

18:22.547 --> 18:27.143
Oh! I do not, Donna.
Now, you feel sorry for me right now.

18:27.219 --> 18:30.655
You can't make someone
like Hyde do anything.

18:30.722 --> 18:32.917
You have to deal with him
the way he deals with you.

18:32.991 --> 18:35.983
Look, pretend you don't care what he does,
and he'll come around.

18:37.396 --> 18:39.660
Well, I guess it's worth a try.

18:39.731 --> 18:42.393
You know, being with
a real man is complicated.

18:42.467 --> 18:45.800
You are so lucky you're with Eric.

18:45.871 --> 18:48.704
What?

18:51.743 --> 18:54.371
What a wonderful weekend!

18:54.446 --> 18:57.006
We should go away more often!

18:58.083 --> 19:00.278
They gotta make a pill for this.

19:02.954 --> 19:05.923
Oh, Hyde, I've been
meaning to tell you.

19:05.991 --> 19:08.323
( Singsongy )
Hyde and Jackie, sitting in a tree.

19:09.961 --> 19:13.795
They're in love like two monkeys.
( Laughing )

19:13.865 --> 19:16.891
Would you shut up, Fez?
That's not even how it goes.

19:16.968 --> 19:20.734
- Well, is it making you mad?
- Yes.

19:20.806 --> 19:23.297
- Well, then, that's how it <i>goes.</i>
- ( Clinks )

19:26.311 --> 19:29.109
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:30.282 --> 19:33.046
Look,Jackie. I know
you were worried before...

19:33.118 --> 19:35.450
so, I just want to let you know...

19:35.520 --> 19:37.954
nothin' happened
on my end this weekend.

19:41.426 --> 19:44.793
I'm not tellin' you that so you'll
tell me what <i>you</i> did.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.563
I just want to let you know
what happened with me.

19:51.636 --> 19:54.469
That's my report to you.

19:57.542 --> 19:59.772
All right.
Good to know.

20:01.246 --> 20:04.613
- ''Good to know''?
- D-Did I stutter?

20:11.490 --> 20:15.119
- Hi.
- Okay.

20:15.193 --> 20:17.593
I know you love Marquette,
and I made my peace with that.

20:17.662 --> 20:20.460
So if that means we're gonna go
to separate schools and drift apart...

20:20.532 --> 20:24.298
and make out with guys
named Ted, then-

20:24.369 --> 20:26.894
That's just the way it's gonna be,
because you're gonna get menopause...

20:26.972 --> 20:30.738
and I'm gonna die, and we can't control
<i>anything</i> that happens to us!

20:34.012 --> 20:37.448
- I'm not going to Marquette.
- Well, then never mind.

20:38.450 --> 20:40.645
I mean, Eric-

20:40.719 --> 20:43.347
I loved it, and when
I was driving home...

20:43.421 --> 20:45.548
I was so excited
to tell you about it...

20:45.624 --> 20:47.819
and then the drive took forever.

20:47.893 --> 20:51.727
And I realized, that's how far away
I'd be from you all the time.

20:51.796 --> 20:54.128
And I don't want that.

20:54.199 --> 20:56.565
So I'll just tell my dad
I want to go to U.W. with you.

20:58.703 --> 21:00.637
Donna, you have no idea...

21:00.705 --> 21:02.639
- how happy you just made me.
- ( Laughs )

21:02.707 --> 21:06.040
Eric, this is gonna be great!
We're gonna be together all the time.

21:06.111 --> 21:08.136
Oh, um-
( Clicks Tongue )

21:10.916 --> 21:13.976
-you're not gonna get all clingy, right?
- ( Laughs )

21:14.052 --> 21:17.112
- Shut up.
- Now, come on. I'm gonna be a big college man.

21:17.188 --> 21:19.247
- Uh-huh.
- I'm gonna need my space.

21:26.631 --> 21:28.690
What do you want?

21:28.767 --> 21:31.133
Once again, the explanation
is pinned to my lapel.

21:33.538 --> 21:36.803
''Dear Mr. and Mrs. Forman.
Please give Michael $30...

21:36.875 --> 21:39.708
''for the game you threw out
the window and broke.

21:40.912 --> 21:43.142
Signed, my parents.''

21:44.549 --> 21:46.608
( Laughs )

21:49.721 --> 21:52.087
Well, you made her laugh.
That's worth 30 bucks.
