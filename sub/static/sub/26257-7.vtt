00:06.256 --> 00:09.843
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:11.928 --> 00:15.765
This is the proposed budget
for the new project.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.810
It's 148.5 billion yen?

00:18.893 --> 00:21.479
Give us a break.

00:21.813 --> 00:26.026
Presenting this to the National Diet
without disclosing the contents is absurd.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.987
Then does the future
of our country not matter?

00:30.447 --> 00:34.409
Regardless, we would need the
Imperial Household Agency to share duties.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.286
Iboshi.

00:37.078 --> 00:40.957
If you're going to go this far,
failure is not an option.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.043
Please leave it to me.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.671
In the end, love will win.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.199
The flight test program
is being postponed a quarter!

02:38.741 --> 02:41.828
Ah, jeez!
It's those damn Dragon Pilots' fault!

02:42.203 --> 02:43.454
Why us?

02:43.830 --> 02:47.083
Well, the choice comes down to
the close proximity of the bedrooms.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.626
Even so,

02:48.710 --> 02:51.713
I didn't sign up for
the Self-Defense Force to do this.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.756
-I feel the same.
-Huh?

02:54.090 --> 02:56.176
But we cannot refuse orders from the top.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.095
That's what it means to be public servants
so it can't be helped, can it?

02:59.554 --> 03:01.055
What's up with her?

03:01.222 --> 03:04.601
Even Flight Leader Kakiyasu questions it.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.311
Pardon me.

03:06.477 --> 03:09.355
The order from the top
is a bit too much this time.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.232
Huh? What kind of order?

03:13.109 --> 03:13.943
Love.

03:14.861 --> 03:15.904
Love?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.575
You did very well, Masotan.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.912
Living on a deserted island
must've been tough.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.664
Okonogi, you were lonely, weren't you?

03:26.915 --> 03:27.999
Yeah, I guess so.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.210
When Masotan was gone, I...

03:30.418 --> 03:33.046
No, no. I'm talking about Amakasu.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.130
Huh?

03:34.547 --> 03:36.424
It's quite amazing, Okonogi,

03:36.507 --> 03:39.260
that you can actually treat
Amakasu like a woman.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.471
Your strike zone is too big.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.015
W-What are you talking about?

03:44.807 --> 03:46.684
Hey, Masotan!

03:47.852 --> 03:49.771
Were you waiting for me?

03:50.188 --> 03:52.357
Or not? Which is it?

03:52.440 --> 03:53.566
Amakasu!

03:53.775 --> 03:55.235
Oh, Okonogi, too.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.237
Were you waiting for me?

03:57.528 --> 03:58.947
Just kidding.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.367
There's no way I'd be waiting for you!

04:03.451 --> 04:05.954
You don't need to deny it so strongly.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.330
I was just joking.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.250
Ah, I'm sorry! That's not what I meant...

04:10.333 --> 04:11.417
Oh, by the way,

04:11.501 --> 04:15.421
Flight Leader Kakiyasu was waiting--
No, I mean, searching.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.923
For you.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.258
Huh?

04:19.008 --> 04:23.596
Vice-Minister Iboshi has given us
quite the challenge.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.516
The White Lovers.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.893
Lacking confidence in themselves,

04:29.018 --> 04:32.188
the girls harbor an obscure blank space
in their hearts.

04:32.647 --> 04:36.317
It's only when those girls
coexist with the OTF

04:36.401 --> 04:38.444
that they realize their own worth.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.197
Only the OTF is in their hearts.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.866
When they are
in a dependent state of mind,

04:43.950 --> 04:47.996
they are able to truly connect
with the OTF.

04:49.038 --> 04:52.667
However, the Dragon Pilots until now
have failed completely.

04:52.792 --> 04:53.626
For the most part.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.545
A love affair, huh?

04:56.337 --> 04:57.463
Precisely.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.966
Love is what blinds young girls

05:00.049 --> 05:02.385
so they no longer depend on the OTF.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.223
Drastic measures
are necessary to prevent that.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.183
Eliminate love.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.312
And purify the love
they have for their OTF.

05:12.770 --> 05:13.688
Yes.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.149
The White Lovers...

05:16.691 --> 05:18.318
will be painted black.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.070
Make the Dragon Pilots fall in love once

05:21.154 --> 05:23.781
then crush it thoroughly into dust.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.658
W-What does that mean?

05:26.117 --> 05:31.080
If they're hit with a traumatizing blow,
they'll never speak of love again.

05:31.205 --> 05:32.540
Supposedly.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.876
But even then, that is--

05:35.793 --> 05:37.754
Thank you for waiting!

05:38.046 --> 05:40.048
Uh... Um...

05:40.423 --> 05:43.801
This is Sergeant Akishima
of the 2nd Air Depot, General Affairs.

05:43.885 --> 05:47.764
Recently, romance within the base in Gifu
seems to be on the decline.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.392
When Self-Defense Force members marry
one another, the turnover rate drops.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.937
Sergeant Akishima is to investigate
the base for information on love.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.272
That is all.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.150
Huh? But didn't you just say differently?

05:59.317 --> 06:00.151
Understood.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.070
The Sotoori Strategy, right?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.780
Sotoori Strategy?

06:04.155 --> 06:08.326
Leave it to me,
Gifu's number one love expert!

06:10.370 --> 06:14.624
First, the one with the most
promising prospects is El Hoshino.

06:14.916 --> 06:18.878
Captain Zaito, the bad boy of Gifu,
already has eyes on her.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.922
Next, we have Mayumi Hitomi.

06:21.005 --> 06:24.801
Maternal types are quite popular
in the Air Self-Defense Force.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.136
What about Amakasu?

06:27.428 --> 06:30.598
Amakasu's one and only choice
is right here.

06:30.890 --> 06:31.849
M-Me?

06:32.183 --> 06:35.561
Rather, there are no other dark horses
or rivals in the running.

06:35.812 --> 06:36.938
Wait a minute!

06:37.063 --> 06:38.314
Like I said before,

06:38.481 --> 06:41.067
I don't have any feelings towards Amakasu!

06:41.150 --> 06:41.984
Before?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.069
Uh...

06:43.236 --> 06:44.487
Sergeant Akishima,

06:44.695 --> 06:48.282
I expect your execution of
the Sotoori Strategy will go well.

06:48.616 --> 06:49.450
Yes, Sir!

06:50.827 --> 06:53.996
Airman 1st Class Okonogi's
show of resistance is natural.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.251
However, I can understand
Vice-Minister Iboshi's fears.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.378
There was that incident with Forest.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.255
I know it well.

07:02.422 --> 07:06.008
After Moriyama fell in love, she wasn't on
the same wavelength as her OTF.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.635
And once she got pregnant.

07:07.969 --> 07:11.639
If only you could have
locked down Tamaru...

07:15.101 --> 07:20.314
Come to think of it, there was no one
chosen for Kinutsugai.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.859
They're out of Weekly Young Jump.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.737
No Young Jump.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.366
I can't read this week's "Kingdom."
Huh?

07:36.414 --> 07:37.748
"Kingdom!"

07:38.040 --> 07:39.709
T-This is...

07:41.169 --> 07:43.588
undoubtedly this week's chapter.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.715
But why is it here?

08:00.813 --> 08:04.233
This is blatantly suspicious,
but I can't stop.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.245
Do you want to read what happens next?

08:19.582 --> 08:23.085
Throughout history in all places,
when a number of women gather,

08:23.211 --> 08:26.214
the ensuing girl talk
will lead to the topic of love.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.466
Or so I'm told.

08:29.050 --> 08:34.472
I want you to pass on to me the contents
of your girls talk with the Dragon Pilots.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.473
Why?

08:35.848 --> 08:37.475
I wonder why indeed.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.979
Nevermind. I'm not that curious about it.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.022
That's true.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.275
There is nothing more interesting
to you than "Kingdom."

08:46.859 --> 08:50.154
It's possible that
you will never fall victim to love.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.072
Huh?

08:52.114 --> 08:54.909
This is a list of all the things I want
to know from the girls talk.

08:55.493 --> 08:59.413
For each topic answered, I will reward you
with one page of "Kingdom."

09:00.164 --> 09:02.875
Why is it asking
about favorite confections?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.669
I wonder why indeed.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.255
I don't need to know.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.675
More importantly, "Kingdom" is typically
18 pages per week.

09:11.300 --> 09:15.555
I've already read 16 pages, which means
there's only two pages left.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.724
Actually...

09:19.517 --> 09:21.561
I have the continuation right here.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.479
H-How?

09:24.438 --> 09:26.440
If you want to read the rest...

09:26.774 --> 09:28.568
you know what to do, right?

09:30.194 --> 09:33.322
It's rare for you
to invite us out, Lilikos!

09:33.614 --> 09:34.949
Yeah. Sure.

09:35.199 --> 09:38.369
Even Hoshino came.
Isn't it great, Hitomin?

09:38.494 --> 09:39.412
Yes, it is.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.622
What kind of lame name is that?

09:41.706 --> 09:45.126
We should give Hoshino
a name too, right, Nao?

09:45.209 --> 09:48.462
-Don't get casual with me!
-Here's the Shishamo smelt!

09:48.671 --> 09:51.007
Yum, Shishamo with smelt eggs!

09:51.299 --> 09:53.801
These are full of eggs, too!

09:53.926 --> 09:57.430
Back home, we only eat ones
without the eggs.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.350
Ladies, which type do you like?

10:01.767 --> 10:04.020
Oh, I prefer the smelt with eggs.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.022
No, which male type?

10:06.522 --> 10:09.150
I think male Shishamo are pretty rare, no?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.819
No, which human male type?

10:12.069 --> 10:14.280
-Huh?
-Why are you asking suddenly?

10:14.363 --> 10:17.283
It's a little weird for him to have eggs.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.744
Hitomin, we're not talking
about Shishamo anymore.

10:20.161 --> 10:25.708
I think I'd like someone
who cherished Futomomo.

10:25.791 --> 10:29.503
-Well, Mr. Ikushima is surely my--
-Oh, I don't need to hear from you.

10:29.670 --> 10:30.713
What?

10:30.796 --> 10:34.300
-What about you, Hisone?
-What a minute...

10:34.508 --> 10:38.220
I've never thought about it.
What about you, Hoshino?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.056
In any case,

10:40.264 --> 10:42.475
I hate gaudy, tactless men.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.977
I'm asking about the types you like.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.771
I don't like men with crew cuts,

10:46.854 --> 10:50.191
overly friendly men who call me "sweetie,"
men who tell dirty jokes...

10:50.274 --> 10:54.070
I feel like there's a certain person
who fits those traits...

10:54.153 --> 10:57.365
Oh, El, sweetie!
What're you all chatting about?

10:57.448 --> 11:00.284
Let us join you for a drink!

11:00.701 --> 11:02.286
Waiter! I'll take a beer!

11:02.370 --> 11:03.537
-That's him.
-Medium draft!

11:03.871 --> 11:04.872
Zaito...

11:04.955 --> 11:08.125
-We were having a guy's night...
-Need a refill? Whatcha drinking?

11:08.376 --> 11:09.585
Calpis sour.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.296
Wow. That's like drinking juice.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.382
How adorable!

11:18.386 --> 11:19.428
El!

11:19.512 --> 11:21.430
DOES EL HOSHINO HAVE AFFECTION
FOR CAPTAIN ZAITO?

11:22.473 --> 11:24.433
Not in the least.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.019
Zaito, your beer is here! Medium draft!

11:27.103 --> 11:27.937
Shut up!

11:28.020 --> 11:32.483
<i>Hiso Maso!</i>

11:35.736 --> 11:37.571
<i>The important thing here</i>

11:37.822 --> 11:40.741
<i>is not making</i>
<i>the Dragon Pilots fall in love.</i>

11:41.784 --> 11:44.912
It is to have them fall in love
and then break their hearts.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.956
I can't do that!

11:47.039 --> 11:50.501
Besides, Amakasu doesn't
have feelings for me...

11:50.626 --> 11:53.254
This is for the sake of the new project,

11:53.337 --> 11:55.089
Airman First Class Okonogi.

11:55.172 --> 11:59.009
It is your obligation as a member
of the Okonogi family.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.303
There are two tickets in there.

12:01.595 --> 12:05.099
You've been approved to leave the base,
you may freely go.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.521
An obligation by birth, huh!

12:10.604 --> 12:13.482
Ah! I found you, Okonogi!

12:14.024 --> 12:15.901
A-Amakasu?

12:16.026 --> 12:20.364
I saw you were enjoying a smoke
during your smoking time!

12:20.990 --> 12:22.825
You're drunk, aren't you?

12:23.075 --> 12:24.618
Do you like drinking?

12:25.161 --> 12:28.247
Nope. I don't get the taste of it...

12:28.956 --> 12:32.918
but since the Dragon Pilots arrived,
I've had more chances to drink.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.796
I remember!

12:36.255 --> 12:39.091
I hate you, Okonogi!

12:39.175 --> 12:43.846
I hate and despise you!
You said you'd never wait for me!

12:43.929 --> 12:45.014
From this afternoon?

12:45.306 --> 12:46.182
I hate you.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.601
Make it up to me somehow.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.770
Oh... Um...

12:50.853 --> 12:51.937
Here.

12:52.354 --> 12:53.230
Movie?

12:53.731 --> 12:57.610
Since tomorrow's a holiday,
would you want to go with me?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.945
But, we need permission to leave.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.114
Oh, about that, um...

13:02.281 --> 13:06.410
these tickets give you preferential
treatment so you're excused already.

13:06.911 --> 13:10.080
That's so convenient!

13:10.372 --> 13:12.082
'Cause it doesn't exist.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.084
Thank you so much!

13:14.543 --> 13:16.754
I don't hate you, Okonogi!

13:19.340 --> 13:20.966
Thank you very much.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.267
Snooze, snooze...

13:52.790 --> 13:54.333
I just witnessed something major.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.463
I haven't filled in a thing.

14:00.130 --> 14:03.843
But how does he have
next week's "Kingdom" already?

14:04.134 --> 14:07.179
He must have some amazing connections.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.224
And who is he in the first place?

14:10.307 --> 14:11.976
It's packed today.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.435
May I sit here?

14:13.519 --> 14:14.520
Sure.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.731
While you're here, I want to ask you
some questions, Hitomin.

14:18.148 --> 14:23.070
Oh, Onaga! There's a seat over here!

14:23.362 --> 14:24.780
O-Okay.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.158
Are you alone today?

14:28.242 --> 14:31.161
Yeah. Zaito's got a hangover.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.665
He was drowning his sorrows
quite a bit with alcohol last night.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.794
Well... he's not a bad guy really.

14:38.878 --> 14:43.549
Just sometimes he can be a handful
when he's in front of a girl.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.427
Would you like to eat this, too?

14:46.802 --> 14:48.804
Oh? You don't want it?

14:49.430 --> 14:50.306
Thanks.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.600
-Excite, excite.
-Mm...

14:54.268 --> 14:55.728
Take this too, if you want.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.771
Okay. Thanks.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.816
You eat very well,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.401
just like Futomomo!

15:03.527 --> 15:06.071
Can I pet you a little?

15:08.365 --> 15:09.867
Oh, it's hard.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.703
I-I'm... all finished!

15:13.704 --> 15:17.583
It'd be wonderful to see him
get more excited.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.336
You came onto him
like a hostess at a club.

15:21.378 --> 15:25.174
Oh no, was I acting
like a pervy old sex offender?

15:25.424 --> 15:28.218
What should I do? I'm remorseful.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.304
You think you're the club's customer?

15:41.398 --> 15:44.026
<i>T-This is ridiculous.</i>

15:44.360 --> 15:46.153
<i>Watching this on a date</i>

15:46.236 --> 15:48.322
<i>hardly makes me look favorable.</i>

15:56.288 --> 15:58.540
Okonogi, everything's delicious.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.962
Amakasu, could you put that away
while we eat?

16:03.045 --> 16:04.171
Okay.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.966
That movie was so crappy
that it was refreshing.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.760
Huh? But you were crying--

16:09.843 --> 16:10.678
I'm so sorry!

16:11.261 --> 16:14.098
The agony in the zombies's cries
was great background music,

16:14.181 --> 16:15.641
and it made me think.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.226
Think about what?

16:17.726 --> 16:21.146
This was my first time coming
to the movies with a friend.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.774
When you say friend, do you mean me?

16:23.983 --> 16:27.486
S-Sorry!
Was it too much for me to call you that?

16:27.736 --> 16:29.738
N-No, it's an honor.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.283
Same with a flower dance.

16:33.909 --> 16:37.287
I've never experienced hanging out
with friends before.

16:38.080 --> 16:42.793
When we were training on the island,
it was fun because it was like camping.

16:43.127 --> 16:47.506
That alone was enough
to make every day shine.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.843
It was so strange. I just started crying.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.178
Amakasu, you're amazing, too.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.263
Huh?

16:54.346 --> 16:59.018
My future had always been decided for me,
taking after my parents' work.

17:00.394 --> 17:04.273
Okonogi, your parents were airmen, too?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.859
The tracks were already laid out for me...

17:07.109 --> 17:10.988
so, I've never thought of
what I truly wanted to do.

17:11.280 --> 17:15.034
The fact that you've fretted over it
and finally found that is--

17:15.117 --> 17:19.038
Okonogi! That is so awesome!

17:19.121 --> 17:20.998
Huh? That's kind,

17:21.331 --> 17:24.126
but all I do is what others tell me to do.

17:24.251 --> 17:27.504
You really like Masotan, right?

17:27.588 --> 17:29.840
Uh, yeah. I do.

17:30.090 --> 17:34.136
The things you like and the things decided
for you are in agreement.

17:35.387 --> 17:39.600
You've taken your assigned duties
and mixed it with your own will,

17:39.767 --> 17:41.769
and you, Mr. Something Okonogi...

17:42.478 --> 17:45.522
-Um, what's your first name?
-It's Haruto.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.649
And you, Mr. Haruto Okonogi,
burst on the scene!

17:53.614 --> 17:56.533
Okonogi, are you trying out
a new wild look?

17:57.284 --> 17:58.160
No.

17:59.244 --> 18:02.706
I wanted to go shopping after this.
Do you want to go, too?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.880
Sure, I'd be happy to go with you.

18:12.841 --> 18:16.470
At this rate, I'll only
get to read six pages.

18:21.558 --> 18:22.434
Oh?

18:32.861 --> 18:33.779
Hey.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.280
What now?

18:35.739 --> 18:38.659
Just wanted to get
the liquor out of my system.

18:38.742 --> 18:39.910
I don't care.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.007
I guess there's no spark after all.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.474
How sad!

19:02.933 --> 19:04.768
You actually went all out against a girl.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.771
God damn it!

19:07.855 --> 19:09.940
You're too damn cool, El!

19:11.108 --> 19:13.652
Dammit. I'm not going to lose.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.239
I'm... cool?

19:23.537 --> 19:25.289
Hisone's on a date?

19:26.331 --> 19:28.208
What a predicament.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.087
Mr. Ikushima, are you interested...

19:32.421 --> 19:34.381
in Amakasu?

19:35.299 --> 19:39.720
Feelings of love will cause over-secretion
of hormones in her body

19:39.970 --> 19:42.556
and distort her suit size!

19:46.226 --> 19:48.020
Masotan! I'm home!

19:53.984 --> 19:55.819
I brought you a souvenir.

19:56.320 --> 20:00.115
I'm sorry, but secondhand flip phones
are surprisingly expensive.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.327
With my salary, I could only
afford to buy five.

20:04.953 --> 20:09.208
These are tokens
of my appreciation for you, Masotan.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.461
Because of you, I've made friends.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.213
Lots of things have happened,

20:14.922 --> 20:16.465
so I'm enjoying every day.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.842
Thank you, Masotan.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.519
T-They noticed?

20:29.770 --> 20:32.648
I'm sorry, Masotan! I'll buy more
next time, but share now--

20:33.357 --> 20:35.150
A... Amakasu?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.653
Futomomo!

20:38.111 --> 20:40.656
-Calm down!
-Go home, Norma!

20:41.531 --> 20:44.243
Even Akemi is getting riled up.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.495
Are flip phones that delicious?

20:46.578 --> 20:47.412
Oh!

20:47.788 --> 20:50.207
What's your favorite confection?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.000
Uh... Kamome or Tamago!

20:52.542 --> 20:55.420
-What about you, Hitomin?
-Hagi or Tsuki!

20:55.504 --> 20:57.047
Yes!

21:01.301 --> 21:03.512
One, two, three.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.640
You've done excellent work.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.560
I look forward to working with you again.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.896
Excuse me! Who are you?

21:15.899 --> 21:17.567
Whatever.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.283
I've been tricked!

21:25.242 --> 21:27.828
I will now present
the Sotoori Strategy findings.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.581
The probability of romance
developing for these women is...

21:31.999 --> 21:33.375
exceedingly low.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.376
Huh?

21:34.668 --> 21:36.837
Gosh, this is so boring!

21:37.129 --> 21:42.050
I wish they wouldn't work so hard
and recognize their own positions.

21:42.509 --> 21:46.013
In their position, working is exactly
what they should be doing.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.889
How can you say that?

21:47.973 --> 21:50.559
They may be Self-Defense Force members,
but they are women first!

21:50.642 --> 21:52.561
Love is a woman's work!

21:54.187 --> 21:56.023
Thank you, Sergeant Akishima.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.317
If something happens, we'll call you.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.279
Yes, sir. Though, I'm the one
expecting something to happen.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.825
What about Technical Sergeant Amakasu?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.703
Yes. We are now friends.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.621
Friends?

22:13.498 --> 22:14.583
Love...

22:15.584 --> 22:19.254
No matter how much we avoid it,
it always comes unpredictably.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.924
To stop the law of love
from shaking the law of the land,

22:23.675 --> 22:27.262
they must devote
themselves wholly to the OTF.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.639
Driver, stop the car!

22:29.973 --> 22:30.807
No...

22:31.224 --> 22:33.018
just keep going.

22:42.611 --> 22:46.615
She has grown older... but still...

22:47.282 --> 22:49.951
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.542 --> 24:22.669
Slowly, slowly.

24:22.752 --> 24:23.753
Amakasu!

24:23.879 --> 24:24.796
So fast!

24:24.963 --> 24:27.215
I wonder if they're impatient?

24:27.299 --> 24:29.801
My body's just reacting on its own.

24:29.926 --> 24:33.430
How much are you stuffing in
after a single date?

24:41.938 --> 24:44.941
