WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:01.567
.

00:01.569 --> 00:03.202
You know why
you're up here, roman?

00:03.204 --> 00:05.037
Because i screwed up.

00:05.039 --> 00:07.239
[gunshot]

00:07.240 --> 00:09.440
I've decided to take a spot
on a federal task force.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.143
Special agent david lang.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.511
You obviously already know
who i am.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.647
Ordinarily, i don't allow
for relationships in my unit,

00:15.649 --> 00:16.715
But lindsay's spot's open.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.017
It's yours.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.052
You're not gonna
miss this?

00:20.054 --> 00:21.286
You know, it's not like

00:21.288 --> 00:23.706
It's the last time
i'm gonna put on a vest.

00:23.707 --> 00:26.125
No, it's just the last time i'm
gonna help you get it on right.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.368
That's what,
your fourth mag?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.470
Counting?

00:41.275 --> 00:43.509
[sighs]

00:43.510 --> 00:45.744
Task force isn't
like intelligence.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.279
They're...

00:47.281 --> 00:50.115
Slick.

00:50.117 --> 00:51.417
I don't know.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.085
So show them
how it's done.

00:53.087 --> 00:56.555
It's natural to be nervous
on your first day.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.291
You should've seen me
at my first day

00:59.293 --> 01:01.260
At the racing rapids
snack bar.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.562
I was a wreck.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.165
This is the right move
for me...

01:06.167 --> 01:07.166
Right?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.401
Hell yes.

01:09.403 --> 01:13.238
Just keep your head down.
Work hard.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.508
There's a reason
they recruited you so heavy.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.744
You're the man
for the job.

01:18.746 --> 01:22.314
[both chuckle]

01:26.587 --> 01:28.821
Hey.

01:28.823 --> 01:30.589
- Here's lindsay's files.
- Oh.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.691
Just see what we need
to offload.

01:32.693 --> 01:36.195
Have you thought about
who's going to fill her spot?

01:36.197 --> 01:38.864
Offer's been extended
to burgess.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.801
Big shoes to fill.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

01:52.346 --> 01:54.279
(lang)
good morning.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.315
Beautiful day for a raid,
huh, boys?

01:56.317 --> 01:59.251
[applause]

01:59.253 --> 02:01.153
Damian mendoza...

02:01.155 --> 02:04.389
Money smuggler
for the zetas cartel.

02:04.391 --> 02:07.626
His operations moves millions
in drug money

02:07.628 --> 02:10.162
From chicago to mexico
each month.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.264
We take mendoza out,

02:12.266 --> 02:16.235
We cripple
the city's drug trade.

02:17.271 --> 02:20.372
With the help of our informant,
kylie rosales,

02:20.374 --> 02:21.874
Mendoza's girlfriend
and bookkeeper,

02:21.876 --> 02:25.210
We've been able to pinpoint
his chicago base of operations.

02:25.212 --> 02:26.712
Mendoza runs
his counting house

02:26.714 --> 02:28.280
Out of the back
of m & b sheet metal.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.315
Kylie says
this month's shipment

02:30.317 --> 02:32.317
Leaves for mexico
tomorrow.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.286
So we hit it today,
while the place is flush.

02:34.288 --> 02:37.322
If there are
no questions,

02:37.324 --> 02:40.159
Do your final checks
and kit up.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.166
Hey, kylie.

02:47.168 --> 02:50.169
How you doing?

02:50.905 --> 02:52.871
I know this is a lot
to process.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.407
[sighs]
honestly, i just--

02:55.409 --> 02:58.277
I want this all
to be over with.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.279
If anyone finds out
i snitched on damian,

03:00.281 --> 03:01.480
I'm as good as dead.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.750
Damian won't suspect
a thing, all right?

03:04.752 --> 03:06.552
You just go
into work as usual.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.387
And when we move in,
we're gonna cuff you

03:08.389 --> 03:10.389
Just like everybody else.

03:10.391 --> 03:14.226
If anything goes wrong, just
text that number we gave you.

03:14.228 --> 03:17.229
I don't know
how i got in this deep.

03:17.231 --> 03:21.333
I started dating damian, and
suddenly i'm running his books.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.470
I never wanted to be
this person.

03:25.472 --> 03:29.441
Well, tomorrow you wake up
with a clean slate.

03:29.443 --> 03:32.311
We apprehend him,
we drop all your charges,

03:32.313 --> 03:33.979
And you walk.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.414
And how you live
the rest of your life

03:35.416 --> 03:37.716
Is completely
up to you.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.253
[exhales shakily]

03:41.255 --> 03:43.889
[sniffles]
okay.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.290
It's time.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.729
(lang)
you're over here.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.231
Each vest has a body cam

03:52.233 --> 03:54.366
That live-feeds video
back to headquarters.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.901
You guys rent
satellite time.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.002
I think we own one.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.403
Huh.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.605
Helmets are mic'd up.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.273
Every guy's got you
right in their ear.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.308
Swat's trained
out of quantico.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.810
Give me your weapon.

04:04.812 --> 04:08.247
Oh, my 19
goes everywhere i go.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.382
This is a federally assigned
glock .45

04:10.384 --> 04:11.383
With extended magazine,

04:11.385 --> 04:13.385
Plus an additional
25 rounds.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.887
- It's very nice, but i'm good.
- I'm not.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.856
Take the .45.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.368
[tires screeching]

04:33.707 --> 04:36.808
[tools grinding]

04:38.545 --> 04:39.678
(man)
get down on the ground!

04:39.680 --> 04:40.946
(lindsay)
get down on the ground now!

04:40.948 --> 04:42.648
(man 2)
get down! Get down!

04:42.649 --> 04:44.349
(man)
let me see your hands!
Get 'em up.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.985
(man 1)
nobody move!

04:52.693 --> 04:56.428
[alarm blaring]

05:03.837 --> 05:06.638
(agent)
fbi! Search warrant!

05:29.763 --> 05:31.063
They knew
we were coming.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.466
And they have kylie.

05:44.378 --> 05:44.609
.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.322
What do you got
for us today, sarge?

05:46.323 --> 05:48.034
You're on light duty until
you heal from your shooting.

05:48.035 --> 05:49.746
My personal and my city doctors
cleared me.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.849
I'm fine.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.084
But your sergeant says
you're not,

05:52.086 --> 05:53.819
So behind the desk
until i say.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.789
What desk?
Ugh!

05:57.791 --> 05:58.857
Me?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.525
N--what?
No.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.960
What are you gonna do?

06:01.961 --> 06:03.394
Commander fischer wants
district supervisors

06:03.397 --> 06:04.730
To re-acclimate themselves
to the streets.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.465
That's what
i'll be doing today.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.899
Oiled up my wheel gun
and everything.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.735
- Oh, heavens.
- It's not--

06:09.737 --> 06:11.136
Squad's gassed up,
sergeant.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.536
Sergeant, i don't know
the first thing about--

06:12.539 --> 06:13.705
No one spends more time

06:13.707 --> 06:15.640
Drooling in front
of this formica than you.

06:15.642 --> 06:16.908
You've seen
how it works.

06:16.910 --> 06:17.943
But, burgess...

06:17.945 --> 06:19.478
What?

06:19.480 --> 06:23.115
Uneasy lieth the head
that weareth the crown

06:23.117 --> 06:25.951
Upon the top
of thine head.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.786
- What does that mean?
- She knows.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.454
I don't, actually.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.490
Let's roll.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.594
You sure you're ready
to be back so quick?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.829
What? Yeah.
Yeah, i'm fine.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.465
Just don't push yourself
too hard, all right?

06:42.736 --> 06:44.836
All that surveillance,
and we didn't know

06:44.838 --> 06:46.138
About the secondary
loading dock?

06:46.140 --> 06:48.673
The blueprints we were
working off didn't include it.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.976
Cook county assessor's office
hadn't updated the files.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.879
God knows how long they were
gone by the time we got there.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.547
We're not getting a signal
from any of the trackers

06:55.549 --> 06:57.549
On mendoza's vehicles,
and kylie's phone is shut off.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.817
There's no way
to track it.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.552
We can put out
an investigative alert,

07:00.554 --> 07:02.187
But the plates have probably
been switched by now.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.523
Get homeland security
on the line.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.691
Make sure they got eyes
at every border checkpoint.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.831
Kylie played us,
plain and simple.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.667
How much do we really know
about that girl?

07:16.737 --> 07:19.838
We flipped her in some
small-potatoes drug bust.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.456
You know the type.

07:21.457 --> 07:23.073
Two-month investigation
with national jurisdiction--

07:23.076 --> 07:25.477
We're back to square one.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.180
Mendoza could be anywhere
with that money right now.

07:28.182 --> 07:31.149
This is his home base.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.984
And if there's one thing
i know about this city,

07:32.986 --> 07:35.020
It's that there's plenty
of places to hide.

07:35.022 --> 07:38.690
Cpd has a fugitive
apprehension unit.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.059
Let's get them
on the line.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.096
Is there a problem?

07:45.098 --> 07:47.833
I know sergeant howells
over there.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.701
Their unit isn't
exactly careful.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.637
Mendoza would hear us coming
from a mile away.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.974
You got
a better suggestion?

07:55.976 --> 07:58.710
Let me call
my old unit.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.479
No one knows their way
around this city

08:00.481 --> 08:02.814
Better than intelligence.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.684
You can vouch
for these guys?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.819
100%.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.926
You're sure?

08:14.928 --> 08:17.929
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm happy to help.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.833
All right, erin,
we'll head over now.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.802
Hmm.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.770
This should be interesting.

08:30.577 --> 08:31.843
Really, burgess?
I thought we were cool.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.645
We are cool.
We're totally cool.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.514
Assigning me the only car
in the district

08:35.515 --> 08:37.883
Without a working heater?
I'm gonna freeze my rocks off.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.217
Last i drove it,
it worked fine.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.720
Last you drove it,
it was june.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.258
You want a new car,

08:46.260 --> 08:48.093
You get a new car.

08:48.095 --> 08:52.130
Okay, vehicle 4720,
all yours.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.666
I'll get r service
to check out the old one.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.901
You're true blue, burge.
Thanks.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.302
[chuckles]

08:57.304 --> 09:00.038
See? It's nothing but honey
up in here.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.876
Oh, check you out.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.311
When did you pass
the sergeant's exam?

09:06.313 --> 09:07.812
Don't ask.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.080
Uh, what's going on?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.249
Lindsay's task force
called us in.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.817
How you doing,
first day back and all?

09:12.819 --> 09:14.586
- You all right?
- Yeah, i'm fine.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.987
- You sure?
- Yes, i'm fine.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.856
Come on,
get out of here.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.591
Okay.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.964
I don't care
who knows it.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.201
Our ci, kylie, was supposed
to alert us

09:30.203 --> 09:31.803
If anything went sideways.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.673
Best we got is that
she tipped off mendoza

09:34.675 --> 09:36.708
Before we raided.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.144
We think they're still
in chicago, most likely looking

09:39.146 --> 09:42.914
For alternative means to move
their cartel cash to mexico.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.951
And that's where
our unit--

09:45.953 --> 09:48.987
Your unit--sorry--
comes in.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.322
You guys know chicago.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.157
We need your help
tracking down the key players

09:52.159 --> 09:53.858
In mendoza's operation.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.827
Sounds good.

09:55.829 --> 09:59.698
We need intelligence to focus
on mendoza's three lieutenants--

09:59.700 --> 10:03.134
Emilio quentin, eduardo fuentes,
and franco gamboa.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.137
We find them, they'll lead us
to mendoza and the money

10:06.139 --> 10:07.939
And hopefully kylie.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.841
Lieutenants it is.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.810
You know, there are
other guys in the cartel.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.278
You look
into any of them?

10:13.280 --> 10:16.982
Mendoza is the only zeta member
we were able to get eyes on.

10:16.984 --> 10:20.018
But if you find a name,
follow it down.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.386
(castillo)
we got a problem.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.688
Kylie's brother just filed
a missing-persons report.

10:23.690 --> 10:24.923
Her brother?
What's his story?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.324
(lang)
he's nobody.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.260
Call oemc,

10:28.261 --> 10:30.195
Have them redact that bulletin,
bring the brother in.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.831
We don't want any other agency
touching this case.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.134
One of our techs
can get you set up

10:36.136 --> 10:37.836
In a conference room.

10:37.838 --> 10:38.970
Analysts are
at your disposal.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.339
We know
what we got to do.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.974
Prefer to run this
out of our own shop,

10:42.976 --> 10:45.043
If it's all the same.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.850
Stay in contact.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.918
Of course.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.424
Good to see you.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.394
Working with
your old unit...

11:02.396 --> 11:03.828
There's no problems,
right?

11:03.830 --> 11:06.665
Not at all.
We're a family.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.901
As long as you understand,
they work for us now.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.238
Got it.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.377
(lang)
officer lindsay,
carlos rosales...

11:19.379 --> 11:20.879
Kylie's brother.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.347
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.348
She yours?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.817
Uh, no, this is kristina.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.352
It's kylie's daughter.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.155
Kylie dropped her off
at my house two days ago.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.857
She said she was gonna
leave damian.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.225
Now i haven't heard
from her.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.710
Do you have any idea

11:35.711 --> 11:37.194
Where mendoza
might have taken your sister?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.231
No idea.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.266
We were supposed to move in
with our cousin in orlando.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.835
We bought one-way tickets
and everything.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.037
Kylie didn't want her kid around
guys like mendoza anymore.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.841
[kristina whines]
- please find her.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.143
Her and kristina
are all the family i got.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.245
We'll do everything
we can.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.350
Get comfy.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.852
The two of you
aren't going anywhere

12:00.854 --> 12:02.253
Until we catch
this maniac.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.324
- Leave something out?
- What do you mean?

12:06.326 --> 12:08.827
You've should told me
that kylie has a daughter.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.929
She's got a grandma
in minneapolis

12:10.931 --> 12:12.330
And a tree-nut allergy.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.998
- Why does it matter?
- Because the way i work...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.934
Every detail
about a ci matters.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.836
Well, now that you know
that she has a kid,

12:17.838 --> 12:19.871
How does it change things?

12:19.873 --> 12:22.107
It means
she wasn't playing us.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.042
There is no way she'd risk
her daughter's life

12:24.044 --> 12:25.910
And lie to the dea.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.813
Wherever she is,
she is there against her will.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.415
Hmm.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.817
Maybe.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.989
[sighs]

12:40.961 --> 12:43.762
[exhales deeply]

12:49.402 --> 12:51.269
[sighs]

13:01.782 --> 13:04.849
[sighing]

13:11.458 --> 13:12.702
.

13:12.703 --> 13:13.947
- You gave garcia a new car.
- Okay.

13:13.948 --> 13:15.192
But no mp3 jack--that's hardly
a reason to switch out.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.395
But you gave garcia
a new car.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.532
Walk. Leave. Now.

13:24.371 --> 13:28.273
So how's it going,
acting desk sergeant burgess?

13:29.943 --> 13:31.409
All good.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.278
Yeah.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.146
Yeah, you know,
a little velvet glove here,

13:35.147 --> 13:37.014
A little iron fist there--
i think i've got it down.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.483
So it's that easy?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.119
You mastered my job
in two hours?

13:42.355 --> 13:44.455
No, no, no.
That's not what i'm saying.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.524
[stammering]

13:46.526 --> 13:48.226
- No, i don't have it maste--
- trudy.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.594
Cermak and pulaski.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.129
Yeah, that's my old beat.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.965
Task force raided
m & b sheet metal this morning.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.034
Place was a front
for damian mendoza.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.236
He's a money smuggler
for the zetas.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.370
Talk to your cis,

13:59.372 --> 14:01.506
See if they saw anyone
coming in or out.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.975
I'll go see a man
about a horse.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.480
Thought about
what we discussed?

14:09.482 --> 14:10.515
Hell, yeah.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.052
Well, let's talk
after shift.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.020
I wouldn't mind
the federal paycheck.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.089
It would be a lot more
than i make now.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.024
I wouldn't mind
some of those flat screens.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.993
Take this place out the '70s
if you put them in here.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.528
They got nice offices
and all,

14:23.530 --> 14:26.364
But i don't totally understand
lindsay going there.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.299
Why not?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.401
I don't know. It's too uptight.
She's all rough and tumble.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.171
I mean, maybe she's more of a
ladder climber than we thought.

14:33.173 --> 14:36.107
- Ambition ain't a crime, kid.
[cell phone vibrating]

14:36.109 --> 14:37.342
Fair enough.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.410
Hey, hey.
The task force put trackers

14:39.412 --> 14:40.979
On three of mendoza's
work cars.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.415
They all came back registered
to a cassie thomas.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.418
Cassie thomas.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.087
There, cassie thomas.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.256
Girlfriend
to emilio quentin.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.490
Isn't that one
of the lieutenants?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.926
(halstead)
yeah, it's him.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.661
Here.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.163
All right, jay,
you read, i'll drive.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.104
How much do you think one
of these condos sets you back?

15:06.106 --> 15:08.406
A stick and a half,
at least.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.579
I thought you were
the delivery guy.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.516
Wish i was.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.984
Nice cat.

15:19.986 --> 15:23.154
Wow.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.689
Emilio quentin,

15:24.691 --> 15:26.925
Works for a guy
named damian mendoza.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.459
I haven't seen emilio
in years.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.496
That right?

15:31.498 --> 15:34.065
So, cassie,

15:34.067 --> 15:36.534
How's the nail salon doing?

15:36.536 --> 15:38.670
You work part-time, right?

15:38.672 --> 15:40.505
I do nail art.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.474
You must have really scrimped
and saved to afford this place.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.443
[halstead chuckles]

15:45.445 --> 15:47.145
Excuse you?

15:47.147 --> 15:50.148
You can't come up in here
and judge me.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.550
Having nice things isn't a crime
last i checked.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.219
No, but buying things
with drug money is.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.357
Second time now--
where's emilio?

15:59.359 --> 16:01.192
No clue.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.961
One of the cars mendoza used
in his operation

16:02.963 --> 16:04.529
Is registered
in your name.

16:04.531 --> 16:08.399
Emilio bought me a car
after our first date.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.667
It was that good.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.469
Mm.
Too bad that same car

16:11.471 --> 16:14.172
Matches a partial plate ripped
from a homicide last month.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.406
Makes you an accessory
to murder.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.474
- Turn around.
- Let's go.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.376
Wait! W-w-wait.
Okay!

16:18.378 --> 16:21.379
Okay.

16:21.381 --> 16:25.550
I swear on my life,
i don't know where emilio is.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.686
But i did--i-i did let him
buy some cars in my name.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.722
And some
of my coworkers too.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.757
How many cars?

16:32.759 --> 16:36.361
Like, 34.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.230
I don't know what he uses
them for, and i don't ask.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.565
Look, cassie,

16:40.567 --> 16:43.134
What car
is emilio driving now?

16:48.341 --> 16:49.540
Atwater,
grab a pen.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.575
We're looking
for a dark-green suv

16:50.577 --> 16:52.143
Belonging
to emilio quentin.

16:53.146 --> 16:56.280
[sighs]

16:56.282 --> 16:57.482
34 cars?

16:57.484 --> 17:00.118
That's how they
move the money.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.153
Crazy.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.425
That's our boy.

17:07.426 --> 17:10.461
[tapping phone buttons]

17:10.463 --> 17:13.196
Yeah, ruzek, i just got a pop
on the nvls plate reader.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.400
The last reading puts quentin
on the 5200 block

17:15.402 --> 17:18.502
Of chicago, in traffic,
moving northbound.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.739
(ruzek)
all right, we got him,
we got him.

17:21.741 --> 17:25.376
He's at laramie and division.
We got a visual.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.333
Stop!

17:51.838 --> 17:53.104
Cpd.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.626
Al?

18:15.628 --> 18:16.761
Put the gun down.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.165
[gun cocks]

18:21.167 --> 18:22.366
Don't be stupid, honey!

18:22.368 --> 18:23.701
Lady, put the gun down.

18:27.674 --> 18:28.106
.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.474
Ma'am, lower your weapon.
We're police.

18:29.475 --> 18:30.841
Make him put
his gun down first.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.727
No way.

18:32.728 --> 18:34.611
All right, both of you,
put your guns down now!

18:39.119 --> 18:41.552
Get on your knees.
Get down.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.821
So it looks like you'll
be needing a new partner

18:43.823 --> 18:45.890
Now that burgess
is moving upstairs.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.693
Man, you go through 'em
like cheap drawers.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.562
Yeah, make sure the next one
knows i'm cursed.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.367
Willy!
You changed seats.

18:56.369 --> 19:00.238
Rodney and me, we switched
back in, like, '08.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.906
He got tired
of the laundromat.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.208
Mm. You still choking back
cherry vanilla?

19:04.210 --> 19:07.178
Hey, don't go messing
with perfection.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.782
Officer roman,
meet willy,

19:11.784 --> 19:14.218
- Official mayor of this block.
- Mm-hmm.

19:14.220 --> 19:18.523
So you heard about the raid on
pulaski at the sheet metal shop?

19:18.525 --> 19:21.559
Do tend to hear things.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.262
We're a little more interested
in what you saw, willy.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.663
Ahh.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.232
Always people
coming and going.

19:28.234 --> 19:31.836
Better to look
the other way, you know?

19:31.838 --> 19:35.373
But i did recognize
some young guys

19:35.375 --> 19:38.776
Who make runs
for urbina.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.612
Esteban urbina,
works for zetas?

19:44.317 --> 19:45.883
That's your last pack,
right, willy?

19:45.885 --> 19:48.252
- Oh, after this, i quit.
- Yeah.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.521
- For good.
- [chuckles]

19:50.523 --> 19:55.326
Thanks, willy.
We'll see you around.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.966
[sighs]
hey.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.535
- Hey.
[kristina fussing]

20:04.537 --> 20:06.504
Here you go.
Coffee.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.739
And...

20:10.643 --> 20:12.276
And for miss kristina.

20:12.278 --> 20:14.212
[chuckles]

20:14.214 --> 20:15.513
Here, want it?

20:15.515 --> 20:16.914
She loves these things.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.850
Kristina...
[gasps]

20:19.852 --> 20:22.987
He practically jumped
into the bag.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.223
He wanted to meet you
so bad.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.657
It's for you.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.227
Uh, thank you...

20:29.229 --> 20:30.828
Really.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.830
Intelligence got one of
mendoza's lieutenants--

20:32.832 --> 20:34.765
- Emilio quentin.
- I'll be right there.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.972
I will get kylie back.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.773
I promise you.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.243
Yeah.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.615
I mean, mendoza ran his
operation

20:50.617 --> 20:52.316
Out of a sheet metal shop.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.318
Got everything you need
to run

20:54.320 --> 20:58.022
A successful
trap car operation.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.323
Let me at this bitch.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.494
Federales.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.329
Gentlemen.

21:05.331 --> 21:08.799
(castillo)
[clears throat]
excuse me.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.435
Oh, that's one of those
backscatter things, huh?

21:11.437 --> 21:12.670
It sure is.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.006
I've read about those.

21:15.008 --> 21:20.278
[device humming, beeping]

21:22.548 --> 21:24.949
Uh-huh.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.917
Money's in the gas tank.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.687
Go ahead.

21:29.689 --> 21:32.757
[tool buzzing]
- hey, uh, i got it.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.859
You might want to
back up.

21:34.861 --> 21:37.928
Gentlemen.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.772
One way to
do it.

21:47.774 --> 21:53.477
[tool buzzing]

21:53.479 --> 21:57.381
(atwater)
damn, you can barely fit
anything in there.

21:57.383 --> 22:00.451
Probably had to fill up
every 30 miles.

22:06.959 --> 22:07.958
[impressed whistle]

22:07.960 --> 22:10.528
Hmm, well, just eyeballing,

22:10.530 --> 22:11.962
Looks like 2 million there.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.031
Oh...In mexico,
they'd call that

22:14.033 --> 22:16.567
"lotto dinero."
[laughs]

22:16.569 --> 22:19.503
[drum and cymbal sounds]

22:19.505 --> 22:21.572
(ruzek)
never mind. It was a joke.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.975
Ruzek stole my chair.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.411
Ha!
Voight and antonio

22:27.413 --> 22:29.447
Have quentin in interrogation
right now.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.482
Is he talking yet?

22:31.484 --> 22:32.950
Not yet, but...

22:32.952 --> 22:34.719
Voight hasn't had time
to stretch.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.787
Hmm...

22:44.063 --> 22:46.664
You know,

22:46.666 --> 22:50.034
We no longer
work together,

22:50.036 --> 22:54.638
So a lot of the old rules
and regulations,

22:54.640 --> 22:57.708
They don't apply
anymore.

23:02.081 --> 23:05.716
Quentin?

23:05.718 --> 23:07.551
Interview room.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.620
This way.

23:14.127 --> 23:16.026
(antonio)
calculated criminal
drug conspiracy,

23:16.028 --> 23:18.763
Aggravated assault,
just the tip of the iceberg.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.965
We can go round and round
like this all you want.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.501
I don't talk until
i get my deal.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.971
[impact]

23:26.973 --> 23:28.539
You didn't
see that.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.409
Where's mendoza?

23:31.411 --> 23:32.476
I ain't giving up
my boys

23:32.478 --> 23:34.945
Until i know i got
an agreement.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.680
(quentin)
seven years max.

23:36.682 --> 23:37.882
And protective custody.

23:37.884 --> 23:41.051
You pull a gun on cops,

23:41.053 --> 23:42.686
There is
no agreement.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.722
I know how you guys work.

23:44.724 --> 23:48.559
I don't think
you do.

23:48.561 --> 23:52.963
You two.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.665
(voight)
you make a deal,

23:54.667 --> 23:56.100
You put that piece
of trash

23:56.102 --> 23:58.169
Back on my streets
in no time flat.

23:58.171 --> 23:59.870
He's a minnow.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.038
And we need to move.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.773
Look, the guy is
dead to rights.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.743
They'll get him
to talk.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.679
Anybody has a problem with
my decision-making,

24:08.681 --> 24:11.048
Take it up with
the a-usa.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.451
I'm making the deal.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.955
Hey, come on.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.024
Come on.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.797
Don't undercut me
again.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.568
You got your deal.

24:30.570 --> 24:34.672
Now tell us what
you know.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.240
Come on,
you're his guy.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.641
He trusts you.

24:37.643 --> 24:38.843
He doesn't trust us.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.044
I sure as hell
don't trust him.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.613
Mendoza's messed up on
all kinds of stuff.

24:42.615 --> 24:43.981
Strip searched us!

24:43.983 --> 24:45.082
He said he found
some federal number

24:45.084 --> 24:46.984
In his call logs.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.652
What call logs?

24:48.654 --> 24:49.854
Dude monitors
every call

24:49.856 --> 24:51.121
Out of his shop.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.873
If somebody's talking
to the feds,

24:52.874 --> 24:54.624
Whoever it is not
gonna be breathing long.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.027
The plan was we drive
the cash to laredo,

24:57.029 --> 24:59.063
Split four ways--
mendoza and us three.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.831
Then this morning,
he calls an audible.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.667
Says we all gotta meet
at some scrap yard

25:02.668 --> 25:04.502
In ashburn because he wants
to drive the money in himself.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.070
You were on your way
to meet him.

25:06.072 --> 25:10.074
Hell no.
I'm trying to get out of town.

25:10.076 --> 25:15.112
Give us the location
of the scrap yard.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.247
Got an address.

25:16.249 --> 25:18.849
Great.
Let's hit it.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.551
Listen, hank,
i'm sorry about the--

25:20.553 --> 25:22.052
Don't even think
about it.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.054
Lang's your boss now.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.123
That's who you need
to make happy, all right?

25:28.828 --> 25:31.729
We'll follow you.

25:31.731 --> 25:35.299
Schmansky and i used to
come here all the time.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.700
Who's schmansky?

25:36.702 --> 25:39.236
Kip schmansky,
my first partner.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.005
Always ordered
carne asada

25:41.007 --> 25:42.573
With extra onions.

25:42.575 --> 25:43.674
[shudders]
should have

25:43.676 --> 25:46.143
Bought stock in
pine fresh.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.012
We get a call to
this robbery one time...

25:48.014 --> 25:50.147
Couple of guys ransacked
a jewelry store.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.682
We get there,

25:51.684 --> 25:54.251
And from the jump,
guys are shooting at us.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.686
Schmansky's got
the first guy covered.

25:55.688 --> 25:56.954
I go for
the second guy,

25:56.956 --> 25:59.023
And my gun jams.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.592
Schmanksy gets a round off
and puts the guy down,

26:01.594 --> 26:03.327
But, oh, my god,
i felt terrible.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.663
What are you gonna do?
Your gun jammed.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.098
That is not how i saw it
at the time.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.067
I started
second-guessing myself.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.702
Lost my edge.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.037
I was a liability.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.939
Every cop knew it.

26:14.941 --> 26:18.142
So schmansky
gets me this.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.144
Cobra revolver.
Never jams.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.279
Slide never
locks back.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.615
Hell of a partner.

26:24.617 --> 26:27.184
Best one i ever had.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.218
You heard that saying,

26:28.220 --> 26:29.820
"ballplayers need
a short memory

26:29.822 --> 26:31.689
At the plate"?

26:31.691 --> 26:33.691
Same goes for cops.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.326
What happened
to burgess happened.

26:35.328 --> 26:36.894
Let it go.

26:36.896 --> 26:42.066
Get your ass back
in the game.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.067
Done with these?

26:43.069 --> 26:45.836
Actually, theo...

26:45.838 --> 26:47.905
We have a few questions
about your boss,

26:47.907 --> 26:50.975
Esteban urbina.

26:55.615 --> 26:58.048
[car door slam]

26:58.050 --> 27:01.185
(antonio)
looks like mendoza and his
lieutenants met up already.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.921
They could be halfway
to mexico by now.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.990
(lang)
hey! Over here!

27:12.098 --> 27:14.198
(lang)
fuentes and gamboa,

27:14.200 --> 27:16.133
Mendoza's two
other lieutenants.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.902
(lindsay)
this was a setup
to take all the money.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.138
No wonder quentin
wanted out.

27:21.140 --> 27:25.309
Mendoza's burning it
to the ground.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.311
Who know what he'll do
to kylie

27:27.313 --> 27:29.880
If he finds out she's
working with us.

27:35.221 --> 27:35.653
.

27:35.655 --> 27:40.391
And we gave quentin
a reduced sentence for this.

27:40.393 --> 27:43.293
So you're one of those
"i told you so" guys.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.996
Am i?

27:45.998 --> 27:48.098
Hey, everybody chill out,
all right?

27:48.100 --> 27:49.099
I'm talking to you too.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.168
[cell phone rings]

27:55.341 --> 27:57.058
Yeah, trudy,
talk to me.

27:57.059 --> 27:58.776
(trudy)
got something you may
be able to work with.

27:58.778 --> 27:59.843
I'm listening.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.815
So, a ci of mine

28:04.817 --> 28:07.317
Saw a kid making runs
to mendoza's counting house.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.019
Turns out he works
for a cartel player

28:09.021 --> 28:11.188
Named urbina.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.257
She broke this kid down
like a cardboard box.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.925
Stop it.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.927
Urbina's a
mid-level zetas guy,

28:16.929 --> 28:18.862
Works with mendoza.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.831
We never got eyes
on him.

28:20.833 --> 28:23.734
Also got
a watering hole for you.

28:23.736 --> 28:26.170
Green mill.

28:26.172 --> 28:29.406
It's nice work.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.008
All right,
we did it your way.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.810
I mean...

28:32.812 --> 28:34.411
Now let us do it ours.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.217
What do you say,
erin?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.119
What's the call?

28:52.765 --> 28:55.933
I'd say we let sergeant voight
and his team do their thing.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.501
And we keep looking for kylie
on our end.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.074
Fine.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.375
Do it.

29:05.377 --> 29:08.278

we're outta here.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.928

we're not open yet.

(voight)

al capone's old joint.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.204
Got a high opinion
of yourself.

29:34.206 --> 29:35.939
Well, i'm a fan
of history.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.008
Mm-hmm.
- We'll deal you back in.

29:46.819 --> 29:49.820
Damian mendoza...

29:49.822 --> 29:52.289
Tell us how
to find him.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.126
Name doesn't
sound familiar.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.495
We already got his lieutenant,
emilio quentin.

30:01.333 --> 30:05.269
This is some of the money
he was driving down to mexico.

30:05.271 --> 30:09.439
All i see
is some cash.

30:09.441 --> 30:14.411
I don't think
he understands.

30:14.413 --> 30:19.950
Bro, there's
a 10% finder's fee.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.486
That's $800k.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.988
We don't want you.

30:24.990 --> 30:25.989
We just want you
to tell us

30:25.991 --> 30:28.025
How to
find mendoza.

30:28.027 --> 30:31.228
We'll give you 24 hours
to get out of chicago.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.463
Or the people
you work for,

30:33.465 --> 30:35.199
They're going to hear
all about

30:35.201 --> 30:38.302
How you led us
to their money.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.504
I'll make sure
of that.

30:45.578 --> 30:50.314
Does that cash have something
like this in it?

30:53.185 --> 30:55.219
(voight)
no.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.487
Means
the tracking card

30:57.489 --> 30:59.056
We put
in the shipment

30:59.058 --> 31:01.625
Is still in there.

31:01.627 --> 31:05.028
Gotta keep tabs on
a guy like mendoza.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.030
Not that i know him.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.302
Lang, how long's it take
you guys

31:12.304 --> 31:14.404
To track an rfid card?

31:15.341 --> 31:18.041
About six seconds.

31:18.043 --> 31:20.077
(hawkins)
what's the rfid tracker
say now?

31:20.079 --> 31:21.278
Copy that.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.181
Lindsay said mendoza's
50 meters away.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.450
That's gotta be him up ahead
in this scrap metal truck.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.218
Mendoza's in
a flatbed truck

31:28.220 --> 31:30.153
Heading eastbound
on 18th street.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.154

33:11.223 --> 33:14.391

Come here. We got you.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.094
There we go.
It's okay.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.295
Come here.
Come on.

Come on.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.648

Watch out, dawg,
i got it.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.510
That's gonna
photograph real nice.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.580
I'll take your word
for it.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.456
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.326
Glad i caught you
before you left.

34:26.799 --> 34:28.598
Oh, maybe a little

the desk, but

34:30.202 --> 34:32.601

34:32.603 --> 34:34.438
Really, god,
i'm fine.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.607
Not that anyone
believes me.

34:37.609 --> 34:41.078

to cover you at that house.

I don't blame you,
okay?

34:46.518 --> 34:49.518
I don't blame anyone.

that rigged up the shotgun.

34:55.327 --> 34:58.295
Hey, you can't carry around
this guilt anymore, okay?

34:58.297 --> 35:01.364
I won't allow it.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.370

your first day?

I know intelligence
is this...

36:11.837 --> 36:15.772
Huge opportunity...

36:15.774 --> 36:19.743
It's just i'm not ready
to be off the beat yet.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.344
My partner and i,
we went through something

36:21.346 --> 36:23.280
With that shooting.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.782
And, you know,
i'm just--

36:25.784 --> 36:27.384
I'm not going to leave him
until we can both

36:27.386 --> 36:32.289
Put it behind us.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.558
My heart's in uniform.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.627
At least right now.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.303
I couldn't ask
for anything more

36:46.305 --> 36:49.506
In one
of my patrolmen.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.522
Kylie,
you got a sec?

37:05.524 --> 37:09.859
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.670
So damian's going to prison
for the rest of his life.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.440
So you never have to
worry about him again.

37:23.442 --> 37:27.244
I hate to ask this,
but, um,

37:27.246 --> 37:30.380
That, uh, ci money's coming,
right?

37:30.382 --> 37:33.016
I really need it.

37:33.018 --> 37:36.386
Like, uh, right now.
[laughs]

37:36.388 --> 37:37.721
I'll take care of it.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.589
You did great.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.658
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.799
[sighs]

37:49.801 --> 37:52.769
So i know how intelligence
gets their cis money,

37:52.771 --> 37:54.904
But i don't actually know
how we go about it.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.706
[laughs]

37:56.708 --> 37:58.708
Everything you hear
about washington is true.

37:58.710 --> 38:02.279
It's inefficient,
bureaucratic,

38:02.281 --> 38:04.547
And a pain in the ass.

38:04.549 --> 38:05.815
[chuckles]
well,

38:05.817 --> 38:07.384
If there are hoops
i have to jump through,

38:07.386 --> 38:08.986
I'm more than willing.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.587
Kylie needs that money to
get back on her feet.

38:10.589 --> 38:12.422
Doj still needs
to review the case.

38:12.424 --> 38:15.625
Hell, they may not award
her any money at all.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.860
I gave her my word.

38:16.862 --> 38:20.030
Look, we reunited her
with a daughter

38:20.032 --> 38:24.000
And took nearly 8 million
in dirty cash off the streets.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.036
It's time
to celebrate.

38:26.037 --> 38:28.071
Let's talk about this
after the press conference.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.707
You ready for this?

38:30.709 --> 38:34.077
Actually, i'm gonna
sit this one out.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.815
You kicked ass today.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.784
Big things ahead
for you.

38:54.399 --> 38:56.566
We successfully
dismantled

38:56.568 --> 38:58.601
[knock on door]
a major drug money

38:58.603 --> 39:01.604
Smuggling operation
within the zetas cartel.

39:01.606 --> 39:04.507
With the help of
the chicago police department,

39:04.509 --> 39:08.778
We were able to apprehend
damian mendoza,

39:08.780 --> 39:11.448
One of the most wanted fugitives
in the country.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.386
Hey.

39:16.388 --> 39:17.620
Hey.

39:17.622 --> 39:20.657
Am i interrupting
anything?

39:20.659 --> 39:25.428
Uh...Just your own
press conference.

39:25.430 --> 39:28.765
- Do you wanna come in?
- Yeah.

39:30.836 --> 39:34.671
So this is how you're
spending your evening.

39:34.673 --> 39:37.941
You must really miss me.

39:37.943 --> 39:41.044
They didn't let you do
any of the talking.

39:42.447 --> 39:43.513
No offense to lang,

39:43.515 --> 39:46.916
But you're a little easier
on the eyes.

39:46.918 --> 39:50.754
It's not really
my scene.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.889
Plus, you know,
voight's got a rule.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.924
You never get
your picture in the paper.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.432
You wanna talk
about your day?

40:02.434 --> 40:04.501
Not really.

40:05.305 --> 40:11.876
