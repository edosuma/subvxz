08:13.093 --> 08:14.327
Nope, in this case,

08:14.327 --> 08:16.530
local governments
created them.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.866
In exchange for building
new cable lines,

08:18.866 --> 08:20.233
early cable companies
were handed

08:20.233 --> 08:23.403
exclusive contracts
by state and local governments.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.873
Ah, come on, Unc, look,

08:27.040 --> 08:28.208
Well...

08:28.208 --> 08:31.211

share the phone lines...

08:31.211 --> 08:32.946
Eh, but cable's
just a fad

08:32.946 --> 08:34.715

I'm intellectually curious.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.033
Why don't other companies

08:53.033 --> 08:55.435

and try to compete?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.137
That's the real scam.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.872
They all agreed
not to.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.909
Years ago, America's cable
companies realized

09:01.909 --> 09:03.944
that if they clustered
themselves by region,

09:03.944 --> 09:06.479
they wouldn't really
have to compete.

(chatter)

09:09.783 --> 09:11.418
(laughing)

09:11.418 --> 09:13.420
They hatched
their plan in 1997

09:13.420 --> 09:16.790
during what one cable executive
called "the summer of love."

09:18.125 --> 09:20.227
Why we gotta fight?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.629
You take Iowa.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.463
And you take Ohio.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.932
Groovy, baby.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.937
(moaning)

09:29.937 --> 09:32.072
We have a merger!
(laughing)

09:36.176 --> 09:39.913
By 2016, America's 40
regional cable companies

09:39.913 --> 09:42.115
had consolidated
to just three.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.116
(snaps)

09:43.116 --> 09:44.517
And without regional
competition,

09:44.517 --> 09:47.621
these greedy monopolists
are free to jack up prices

09:47.621 --> 09:50.624
and keep your speeds
shockingly slow.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.692
(laughing)

09:51.692 --> 09:52.960
Revolting.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.629
And they don't do this
in South Korea or "Paree?"

09:55.629 --> 09:58.531
Nope, in those places,
service providers compete.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.635
In fact, France requires
companies to share space

10:01.635 --> 10:04.037
on their networks
with competitors,

10:04.037 --> 10:06.539
which is why some
French people have not one,

10:06.539 --> 10:09.810
but six high-speed providers
to choose from.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.645
(French accent)
So, you see, Francois.

10:11.645 --> 10:15.615
I lower my prices,
you lower yours.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.653
I raise my speeds,
you raise yours.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.054
So shall we live.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.624
And yes...
so shall we die.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.230
But in our country,
these cable jerks have used

10:30.230 --> 10:33.734
every tool at their disposal
to eradicate competition.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.469
They've even lobbied state
governments to make it illegal

10:36.469 --> 10:38.972
for America's cities to build
their own networks.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.573
I've got it!

10:40.573 --> 10:42.676
We can build a municipal
high-speed network

10:42.676 --> 10:45.078
to compete with cable companies
and boost our town's economy.

10:45.078 --> 10:49.516
Okay, that's actually
gonna be illegal now, sorry.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.918
Boy, you have
soft hands.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.920
And this scheme makes
the internet worse

10:52.920 --> 10:54.487
for all of us.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.989
We think of ourselves as

10:55.989 --> 10:58.859
the most technologically
advanced nation in the world.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.894
But when it comes to high-speed
internet access,

11:00.894 --> 11:02.896
we're at best
in the middle of the pack.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.497
Oh, seriously, guys?

11:04.497 --> 11:07.935
Oh, sorry, I was using
BitTorrent.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.536
Hey, Mitchell,
I'm Susan Crawford.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.038
I'm a professor
at Harvard law School.

11:11.038 --> 11:14.507
And I teach and write about
telecommunications in America.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.843
Oh, Harvard's
a good school...

11:15.843 --> 11:17.544
for people who
couldn't teach at Oxford.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.847
Don't nag my expert,
man.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.916
It's okay, I deal with a lot of
guys like him at Harvard too.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.218
Look, the problem is that these
very few companies

11:25.218 --> 11:28.388
are controlling American's
access to the internet.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.190
And that means
that everyday Americans

11:30.190 --> 11:32.392
are paying too much
for second-class service.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.394
At a time
when modern day life

11:34.394 --> 11:36.363
requires access
to the internet,

11:36.363 --> 11:37.898
it's just as important
these days

11:37.898 --> 11:39.767
as electricity or water.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.568
As important as water?

11:41.568 --> 11:43.703
I won't die if I don't
see Grumpy Cat.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.106
No, but you might have
trouble applying for a job.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.641
The internet is just essential
to modern life.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.243
Exactly, the same thing
happened with electricity

11:50.243 --> 11:51.611
about 100 years ago.

11:51.611 --> 11:54.314
It used to be considered
a luxury, not a utility.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.216
And a very few
private companies

11:56.216 --> 11:58.051
controlled electricity
in America.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.120
It took government intervention
to make sure

12:00.120 --> 12:01.789
that all Americans
had electricity.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.824
Uncle Sam needs
to do his job

12:03.824 --> 12:06.126
and force the cable
companies to compete.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.829
Until he does, we're gonna
keep getting screwed.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.098
If we don't upgrade
the entire country

12:11.098 --> 12:12.933
to fiber-optic
internet access,

12:12.933 --> 12:16.003
we will be behind for
the next several decades.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.971
Thank you, Susan.
You know, I have found this

12:17.971 --> 12:19.940
a very stimulating
tête-à-tête.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.274
Well, you know,
this all reminds me

12:21.274 --> 12:23.510
of yet another point
that Americans...

12:23.510 --> 12:25.178
Again?

12:25.178 --> 12:27.815
Sorry, let me reboot
the router and...

12:27.815 --> 12:28.849
(blowing)

12:28.849 --> 12:31.618
Ugh, this is
so frustrating!

12:31.618 --> 12:32.619
You know what?
You know what?

12:32.619 --> 12:35.355
I'm gonna post about
this on Facebook.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.457
You know, we may be getting
gouged by cable companies,

12:37.457 --> 12:38.491
but at least the best parts
of the internet,

12:38.491 --> 12:39.860
like Facebook,
are still free.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.129
Oh, no, Facebook
isn't free at all.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.664
In fact, you pay
for it every day.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.199
Here, I'll show you.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.500
Inside the internet.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.936
No, no,
not the ear again.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.770
It works in any hole.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.771
The ear will do nicely,
thank you.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.274
(both)
Ahh!

12:54.274 --> 12:55.843
♪♪

12:58.478 --> 13:01.381
♪♪

13:05.785 --> 13:09.056
I imagine that right now you're
feeling a bit like Alice, hm?

13:09.056 --> 13:11.658
Tumbling down the rabbit hole.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.561
Wait, do you still think
"Matrix" parodies are cool?

13:18.866 --> 13:19.867
Yes.
(clinks to floor)

13:19.867 --> 13:22.402
Oh (bleep).

13:22.402 --> 13:24.237
Look around you, Mitchell.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.474
This is the free internet.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.142
We do everything here.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.378
We connect with friends
on Facebook.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.847
Search for information
on Google.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.715
And all of it's free.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.750
Yeah, free.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.053
Wait, actually, how do
these sites make money?

13:40.053 --> 13:41.421
I'll tell you.

13:41.421 --> 13:45.225
But you may not like where
the rabbit hole goes.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.660
So, do I choose a pill or...

13:47.660 --> 13:49.696
Oh, no, these are
my allergy medications.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.431
This one's for pollen
and this one's for lactose.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.266
(loud gulping)

13:53.266 --> 13:54.267
Oh.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.941
Where are we?

14:00.941 --> 14:01.942
What is this place?

14:01.942 --> 14:05.078
This is the internet
of the real.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.514
The truth is these services
aren't free at all.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.450
You pay for them with
your very identity.

14:10.450 --> 14:14.021
When you use Facebook,
they log everything you do.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.389
The pages you like,
the people you interact with.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.625
Even the words
in your status updates.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.760
Then they take
that information, analyze it

14:20.760 --> 14:24.597
and assemble a detailed
profile of who you are.

14:24.597 --> 14:27.067
They know your habits,
your preferences.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.969
They can even determine
your risk tolerance

14:28.969 --> 14:30.703
or sexual orientation.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.975
And then they sell that
information to advertisers.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.644
One risk-taking
homosexual, please.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.782
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

14:48.221 --> 14:51.224
Wait, how do they know?

14:51.224 --> 14:53.793
I'm not even out at work yet.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.163
Hey, I didn't
know you were gay.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.830
And so adventurous.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.899
(chuckles)

14:59.899 --> 15:01.935
(Adam)
That's not hypothetical.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.337
This actually happened
to a woman in Tampa.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.073
Hm, that is problematic.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.775
But come on, we all know
they're showing us ads.

15:08.775 --> 15:12.679
Yeah, but we don't know how deep
Facebook's tentacles really go.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.015
They actually record
which ads we see.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.450
Then partner with firms that
monitor what we do

15:17.450 --> 15:18.851
in the real world.

15:18.851 --> 15:22.255
Jacob like the page
Bacon is Bae last week.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.856
We showed him an ad
for your double bacon

15:23.856 --> 15:25.258
heart attack burger.

15:26.659 --> 15:27.961
He just bought one in Duluth.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.363
Clearly susceptible
to the campaign.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.499
Let's pump him full of ads!

15:36.369 --> 15:37.370
(message alert)

15:37.370 --> 15:39.372
I guess I got room
for one more.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.641
This has gotta be one of
the most invasive advertising

15:41.641 --> 15:43.510
systems ever devised.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.113
Facebook can actually determine
who's the most vulnerable

15:46.113 --> 15:47.180
to an ad campaign.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.882
Then up their dosage
till they buy even more.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.986
Oh, wow, my heart.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.225
Well, I'll simply delete
my Facebook account.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.293
I'm gonna miss those
ex-girlfriend pictures.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.129
But it's worth it
not to be tracked, right?

16:02.129 --> 16:03.830
Sure, you can quit Facebook.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.965
But good luck
escaping Google.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.410
(clicking, hissing)

16:17.410 --> 16:19.146
That's me.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.914
(beeping)

16:24.484 --> 16:25.885
But I'm not even on Google.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.587
I'm, I'm on
a private website.

16:27.587 --> 16:28.721
Exactly.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.757
Google doesn't just track you
when you search.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.992
Their tracking software
is also installed

16:32.992 --> 16:35.262
on over 10 million websites.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.896
Even medical sites.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.566
So, that health info you think
you're looking up in private,

16:39.566 --> 16:41.268
Google's got a front row seat.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.270
Mitchell has erectile
dysfunction.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.605
I know a drug company
that would get rock hard

16:45.605 --> 16:47.340
for that information.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.375
(Adam)
And that's not all.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.743
Every time you write a Gmail,

16:50.743 --> 16:52.412
watch a YouTube video,

16:52.412 --> 16:54.781
or use Google Maps,

16:54.781 --> 16:57.084
Google collects data about you.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.085
God no!

16:58.085 --> 17:00.453
We don't even know
the full extent

17:00.453 --> 17:03.923
of what Facebook and Google
store or what they do with it.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.393
All we know is that they're
collecting our data

17:06.393 --> 17:10.297
on an unprecedented scale
and making billions off of it.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.465
That's their real
business model.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.468
They're monetizing us.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.736
When we use these sites,

17:16.736 --> 17:20.240
we're not the customer,
we're the product.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.542
Why? How?!

17:29.782 --> 17:31.984
Hello, Mitchell, I've been
waiting for you.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.487
Now you're parodying
the second "Matrix" movie?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.956
What? It's the best one.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.092
Mitchell, this is
Ethan Zuckerman.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.994
He's the Director of the
MIT Center for Civic Media.

17:41.994 --> 17:45.332
Mitchell, the fact that the
sites are free is the problem.

17:45.332 --> 17:49.169
When the web was created,
we the users decided

17:49.169 --> 17:51.138
we would rather have free stuff

17:51.138 --> 17:53.072
than pay money
for the services we use.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.809
As a result, the websites have
had to sell ads to make money.

17:56.809 --> 18:00.247
They target ads to us
based on our preferences

18:00.247 --> 18:02.349
and our behavior online.

18:02.349 --> 18:05.485
And that means we're under
constant surveillance

18:05.485 --> 18:09.021
in exchange for these services
that we get for free.

18:09.021 --> 18:12.959
One in six people on earth
now has a Facebook account.

18:12.959 --> 18:16.996
And they make up 20%
of all time spent online.

18:16.996 --> 18:21.801
(Ethan)
That's 1.6 billion people whose
every move is being tracked

18:21.801 --> 18:25.672
by an online big brother that
they chose to live under.

18:25.672 --> 18:26.706
Oh, no.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.007
And here's the kicker.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.642
You wanna know how much
revenue your personal data

18:29.642 --> 18:31.211
is worth to Facebook?

18:31.211 --> 18:34.547
For every user they surveil,
they make just $12.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.715
No.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.617
Your interests,
your personality.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.052
Your relationships,
your privacy.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.688
Those things are priceless.

18:41.688 --> 18:46.559
But you gave them all away
just to avoid paying $12.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.061
No, that--
That can't be.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.030
That's, that's, that,
that's not possible.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.132
Well, there is a bright side.
You wanna hear about it?

18:53.132 --> 18:56.969
No, no, just shut up, shut--
Shut up, let me out!

18:56.969 --> 18:58.137
He's gonna pop.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.138
Let me out!

18:59.138 --> 19:00.573
I wanna get out!

19:00.573 --> 19:02.475
(moaning)
Oh... oh...

19:02.475 --> 19:04.211
You know, this happens
to all my friends.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.050
(sighs)
Thank goose,
it was just a dream.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.219
Oh, good you're awake.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.887
No, no, get me out
of the internet, okay?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.089
Google, Facebook,
the cable companies.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.758
They all have way
too much power.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.561
The internet's ruined, and
there's no way to stop it.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.563
Are you kidding?
Of course there is.

19:23.563 --> 19:27.166
How? I'm not Keanu,
I'm not "The One."

19:27.166 --> 19:28.768
You don't have to be.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.937
We can all do it together
by using the power

19:30.937 --> 19:32.905
of the internet itself.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.907
In 2015, the cable companies

19:34.907 --> 19:37.377
were trying to do away
with net neutrality.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.579
That's the principle that all
data on the internet

19:39.579 --> 19:40.780
is treated equally.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.449
But instead,
they wanted a system

19:42.449 --> 19:44.617
where rich sites could pay for
faster service

19:44.617 --> 19:47.420
while sites without money
would get screwed.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.921
That's awful.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.524
That's what a lot of other
people thought too.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.393
But instead of staying silent,

19:53.393 --> 19:56.263
they used the internet to
communicate with the FCC

19:56.263 --> 19:58.598
and their politicians
and raise their voices.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.200
More than four million
Americans wrote in to protect

20:01.200 --> 20:02.869
the internet they love.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.605
And as a result of all that
political pressure,

20:05.605 --> 20:07.474
the FCC changed direction.

20:07.474 --> 20:10.209
All those people
made that happen.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.246
When you act collectively
to ensure the protection

20:13.246 --> 20:15.582
of the internet,
things change.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.150
And we can do the same with
Facebook and Google.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.986
We can demand more
accountability

20:19.986 --> 20:21.754
for what these sites
do with our data.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.923
And we can vote
with our dollars

20:23.923 --> 20:27.093
by paying for sites
that put our interests first.

20:27.093 --> 20:31.130
Wow, instead of being ashamed
or scared of the internet,

20:31.130 --> 20:33.099
we should use the internet

20:33.099 --> 20:36.002
to raise our voices
and fight for a better one.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.103
Exactly.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.272
We don't have to wait
around for The One.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.341
We can all be superheroes now.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.009
Thanks, Adam.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.244
Ah! Let me.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.346
Oh.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.080
Ahh!

20:50.750 --> 20:52.852
♪♪

20:52.852 --> 20:54.086
Not you again.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.988
I'm sorry to
have bugged you.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.690
I hope you'll accept this

20:57.690 --> 20:59.191
as an apology.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.861
I have work to do.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.299
I read this freshman
year of college.
