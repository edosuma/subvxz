WEBVTT

00:23.023 --> 00:24.858
Good glorious morning, daughter.

00:24.942 --> 00:25.817
-Dad.
-Yes.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.194
You're up!

00:27.277 --> 00:28.654
You're dressed.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.447
You have color in your face again.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.075
I know. I feel 100% better.

00:33.158 --> 00:37.329
It turns out all I needed was
a few days' rest, and now I feel fine.

00:37.412 --> 00:41.208
However, I have come out of my illness
with an important realization.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.918
-What's that?
-That I'm going to die.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.795
-What?
-No tears, no tears.

00:44.878 --> 00:48.215
No, it's just a simple fact.
I'm not long for this world.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.218
Yes. Life is fleeting, a brief candle…

00:52.010 --> 00:53.846
Bye, Eddy.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.264
Before you know it, I'll be gone,

00:55.347 --> 00:57.391
which means I have a lot
of paperwork to get to.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.352
Paperwork?

01:00.435 --> 01:02.729
Yes. The situation is urgent.

01:02.813 --> 01:05.357
No, I have to get
my entire estate in order.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.360
Oh, I have to redraft my will,
notarize my deeds,

01:08.443 --> 01:10.696
and send my collected essays
to the copyist,

01:10.779 --> 01:13.532
not to mention donating
respectable sums of money

01:13.615 --> 01:16.034
to New England's
most enriching institutions.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.870
Emily, the clock is ticking.

01:17.953 --> 01:22.499
I have to solidify my footprint
on the town of Amherst,

01:22.583 --> 01:24.293
not to mention the world.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.837
I may be dead within a month,

01:26.920 --> 01:31.133
but people will never forget
the name Edward Dickinson.

01:34.261 --> 01:39.766
Okay. Well, Dad,
I'm so glad you're feeling better.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.269
There's something
I wanna talk about.

01:42.352 --> 01:45.898
Speak quickly, please.
I have some major benefactions to arrange.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.065
Right.

01:47.149 --> 01:50.736
It's just this rift
between you and Austin.

01:50.819 --> 01:51.945
What rift?

01:52.029 --> 01:55.032
I mean, how Austin got drunk
and said all of those terrible things,

01:55.115 --> 01:57.034
and then your heart literally stopped.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.243
Oh, all that.

01:58.327 --> 02:02.414
Listen, I would honestly understand
if you never wanted to speak to him again,

02:03.540 --> 02:08.753
but I am begging you, with all my heart,
please forgive him.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.341
Oh, my dear, dramatic child.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.427
I'm not the slightest bit angry
with your brother.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.387
-You're not?
-No.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.516
If there's one thing my brush
with mortality has taught me,

02:20.599 --> 02:23.852
it's that life is too short to hold
a grudge against my one and only son.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.646
Dad, I expected you to be so upset.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.732
Emily, it's obvious that Austin is
going through something right now.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.400
I don't want to hold that against him.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.986
I want to support him
in any way that I can,

02:33.070 --> 02:36.615
and if that means he's not gonna speak
to me for a while, then… so be it.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.701
It's not like I'm going to write him
out of my will.

02:39.785 --> 02:44.414
Oh, Father. That is fantastic.
I can't tell you how happy that makes me.

02:44.498 --> 02:49.211
We can have peace.
Peace in this family at last.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.260
Dickinson

02:56.343 --> 02:58.345
The Soul has Bandaged moments

03:06.937 --> 03:10.065
-Thought you were gonna add more ruffles.
-It's a mourning dress.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.777
I know. And whereas other women are only
in mourning for one dead husband,

03:13.861 --> 03:17.072
I am in mourning for the infinite number
of husbands I never even get to meet.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.366
So we're gonna need to kick
this up a notch.

03:19.950 --> 03:24.037
You know, in my opinion,
ruffles don't really say ''grief.''

03:24.121 --> 03:26.999
Really? Do you think
a little more cleavage would help?

03:27.666 --> 03:29.918
Vinnie. Vinnie. Hi, Betty.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.920
Great news. Dad's not mad at Austin.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.340
The Dickinson war is over.

03:35.424 --> 03:40.053
Except, meanwhile the actual war rages on,
which is why I'm gonna need your help.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.263
Help with what?

03:41.346 --> 03:43.098
I'm hosting one
of our sewing circles tonight.

03:43.182 --> 03:46.226
Only I've renamed it
"The Amherst Ladies' Aid Society,"

03:46.310 --> 03:48.145
and we'll be making bandages for soldiers.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.273
Look at you, Vinnie. Doing your part.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.735
Yeah, so it is time
to get your whipstitch on.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.654
Ooh, I was actually gonna do
some writing tonight.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.907
I have so much poetry in my head.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.493
With all this conflict in our family,
none of it has been able to come out.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.663
Finally, tonight I can sit in peace.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.998
I'm sorry.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.583
Peace is not an option right now.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.667
This country is at war,

04:10.751 --> 04:12.878
my ex-boyfriends are dying,
and you need to help.

04:12.961 --> 04:13.962
I can't even sew.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.507
That's true. She really can't.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.636
Okay. We don't need to laugh about it.

04:20.719 --> 04:23.680
Everyone has strengths.
Sewing doesn't happen to be one of mine.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.391
Which is why
Betty will be joining us tonight.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.353
She's the best seamstress in Amherst.
She'll teach us to make roller bandages

04:29.436 --> 04:31.980
and other useful things for the soldiers.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.150
-Even you, Emily.
-That's right, but I can't stay long.

04:35.234 --> 04:38.195
Remember, I have a--
Oh, excuse me.

04:38.278 --> 04:42.574
I have a-- a houseguest.
I am just exhausted.

04:42.658 --> 04:43.909
I didn't sleep last night.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.620
This houseguest of mine,
she keeps me up all night.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.539
-Who is this houseguest?
-Does she snore?

04:49.122 --> 04:53.252
No, she talks.
I'm helping her write her life story.

04:53.335 --> 04:57.631
She's an incredible woman,
and she's lived an extraordinary life,

04:57.714 --> 05:00.634
but she can't read or write,
so I'm helping her get it all down.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.428
We've been going
for three nights straight now,

05:03.512 --> 05:05.472
and she just doesn't stop.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.433
It's just story after story.
I can barely keep up.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.687
That's amazing, Betty.
What a wonderful thing to do for someone.

05:11.770 --> 05:15.691
-Help them write their truth.
-Well, at least it gets my mind off Henry.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.818
No word from him yet?

05:18.402 --> 05:21.113
Oh, my God. What happened to Henry?

05:21.196 --> 05:22.948
Oh, we don't know.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.409
We haven't had a letter from him
for over a month now.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.288
-Are you two still even together?
-Vinnie, please. Be sensitive.

05:30.163 --> 05:34.126
Listen, Betty. I completely get it.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.962
I know what it's like
to lose someone I loved,

05:37.045 --> 05:39.339
or, like, hooked up with once at a party.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.175
Henry is not lost.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.012
He is out there somewhere,
and he's gonna write to Betty very soon.

05:45.888 --> 05:48.390
I hope so for Helen's sake, at least.

05:48.473 --> 05:52.227
He's out there. Betty, he is.
I'm not giving up hope.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.647
Thanks, Emily.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.276
That… That helps.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.361
Well, that's all I want to do.

06:01.445 --> 06:02.905
-Find ways to help.
-Great.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.908
Sounds like you will be joining
the women of Amherst sewing tonight.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.911
Vinnie, Betty, you inspire me.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.871
We can all pitch in.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.498
We can all do our part
and make this world a better place

06:13.582 --> 06:16.710
and fill this country
with love and kindness.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.464
That bitch won't let me hold the baby!

06:20.547 --> 06:22.508
Okay, this seems like
a good time for me to leave.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.968
See you later.
Don't forget to bring an extra thimble.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.471
Who on God's green earth
does she think she is?

06:27.554 --> 06:28.722
What is all this racket?

06:28.805 --> 06:31.016
Oh, Edward! You're out of bed!

06:31.099 --> 06:32.601
Yes. I started feeling better,

06:32.684 --> 06:34.603
so I thought I'd pop down
and revise my will.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.813
Well, you better not be
leaving anything to Sue.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.691
-What did she do?
-She won't let me hold my own grandson.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.153
I am that child's only living grandmother.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.530
Where is the respect?

06:44.613 --> 06:47.783
Not to mention the fact that it was me
who brought him into this world.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.118
Well, technically speaking,
that was Sue, wasn't it?

06:50.202 --> 06:53.413
Oh, please. All she did was lie there
and push a little bit.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.709
Meanwhile, I used
my time-honored Norcross midwifery skills

06:57.793 --> 07:02.422
to guide its skull into the light,
and this is how she thanks me?

07:02.506 --> 07:04.049
She won't even let me in the room.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.552
Okay, you know what?
Honestly, I've always disliked her.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.096
Emily, I need your help.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.806
Me? What can I do?

07:10.889 --> 07:12.683
You're the only one she'll listen to.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.018
She was asking
for you specifically just now.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.229
She said,
"Only Emily can enter the bedroom."

07:17.312 --> 07:19.565
You need to go
and talk some sense into her.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.527
Right. I was just about to go upstairs
and collect my thoughts.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.654
Emily, we don't have time
for your thoughts.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.407
This family is being torn apart,
and if we don't act quickly,

07:28.490 --> 07:30.826
that child may never get to know
his own grandparents.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.452
Oh, don't be absurd.

07:32.536 --> 07:35.247
The child is just a week old.
Have some patience.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.166
Patience? What am I supposed to do,
wait until he's all grown up?

07:38.250 --> 07:40.586
-Yeah.
-Bonding starts immediately.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.172
I need him to know my scent.

07:43.255 --> 07:46.550
Edward, you've never even laid eyes
on this child.

07:46.633 --> 07:50.179
I don't need to meet him. I already know
he's gonna carry on the Dickinson name,

07:50.262 --> 07:52.014
and that's good enough for me.

07:52.097 --> 07:55.142
Speaking of which,
I have to get back to my bequeathing,

07:55.225 --> 07:57.311
and I can't work
in the midst of this hysteria.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.771
So please clear out, will you, please?

07:59.855 --> 08:02.149
I will go as soon as Emily agrees
to talk to Sue.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.112
All right.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.990
Okay. I… I'll try.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.535
Emily, don't forget
about the sewing circle tonight.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.829
Emily, this family is depending on you.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.164
Yes, Emily. Please go. Go.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.373
Emily, do something.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.877
Don't worry, everyone.
Emily Dickinson is here to help.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.929
Is it true, dear Sue?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.972
Are there two?

08:39.311 --> 08:40.562
Go away.

08:42.397 --> 08:43.482
Sue, it's me.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.694
Emily? Come in, please. Come in.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.661
Come here. We have room for you here.

08:58.163 --> 09:01.208
He just nursed. Now he's sleeping.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.836
Do you want to hold him?

09:05.629 --> 09:08.715
Me? Oh, no, that's okay. That's--
I'd probably drop him.

09:08.799 --> 09:09.800
Great.

09:10.634 --> 09:14.763
You don't even want to touch the baby,
and your mother refuses to give him back.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.100
Yeah, so, about that…

09:18.183 --> 09:21.645
Wait a minute. Did she send you over here?

09:22.896 --> 09:23.939
Maybe.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.151
-Can you just tell me what happened?
-You know your mother.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.320
I swear she would try
to nurse this baby herself

09:30.404 --> 09:32.281
if I gave her half a chance.

09:35.158 --> 09:39.872
When she's over here,
all she does is criticize me,

09:39.955 --> 09:44.668
boss me around and give me advice
that I don't need or want.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.337
She just…

09:48.797 --> 09:50.799
She just needs to respect my boundaries.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.053
I hear you. I totally hear you,

09:55.137 --> 10:00.017
but she is so desperate to bond
with her first grandchild.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.146
Could you just cut her a little slack?
Please?

10:09.067 --> 10:11.445
I need more time with him first.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.866
This baby will be a Dickinson soon enough.

10:16.742 --> 10:17.743
Just…

10:19.244 --> 10:21.163
let him be a Gilbert for now.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.834
All right. Let's see this little Gilbert.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.513
Say something to him.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.265
I want him to learn your voice.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.727
Hey, little one.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.855
It's your uncle Emily.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.862
Uncle Emily knows a man
who drives a coach like a thimble.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.991
Turns the wheel all day with his heel.

10:59.535 --> 11:00.744
His name is…

11:02.162 --> 11:03.413
Do you know the answer?

11:04.873 --> 11:07.251
-Go on. Give me a guess.
-Come on, baby.

11:09.044 --> 11:13.298
Okay, I'll tell you.
His name is Bumblebee.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.973
Imagine the child we could raise together.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.100
He'd be a genius.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.270
A prodigy.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.357
Sue, that's impossible.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.570
Is it impossible?

11:35.112 --> 11:39.783
Or is it just not… what you want?

11:43.537 --> 11:44.872
Where's Austin?

11:44.955 --> 11:47.124
Out with George.

11:47.916 --> 11:51.962
They went to jump in Puffer's Pond.
They got drunk on homemade whiskey.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.548
The pond? It's freezing.
It's not even noon.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.217
Well, your brother is a child.

11:57.968 --> 12:01.221
He probably won't even be home for dinner.
He's always out so late.

12:02.181 --> 12:04.933
Emily. You could come.

12:05.893 --> 12:10.981
We could have a little meal together
by the fireside, with the baby.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.525
Wouldn't that be nice?

12:16.612 --> 12:17.613
I can't.

12:18.322 --> 12:19.364
Why not?

12:22.492 --> 12:26.246
I promised Lavinia I would go
to her sewing circle tonight.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.542
We're making bandages for the soldiers.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.628
Damn it.

12:35.214 --> 12:36.882
Why do you always do this?

12:38.300 --> 12:39.301
Do what?

12:41.053 --> 12:42.930
Choose your family over me?

12:44.264 --> 12:45.974
I never-- That's not fair, Sue.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.434
-I'm not choosing anyone.
-Shh.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.979
Maybe that is the problem.

12:51.939 --> 12:56.735
Sometimes, I would like to feel chosen.

12:59.196 --> 13:05.786
I would choose you over anyone,
anytime, anyplace.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.667
My family is on the verge
of tearing itself apart.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.795
All I wanna do is just make sure
that everyone is okay.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.463
I'm just trying to help, Sue. I'm--

13:16.547 --> 13:19.132
There are so many ways
that you could be helping me.

13:23.387 --> 13:26.390
You know, I didn't even want to go
to the sewing circle tonight.

13:26.473 --> 13:30.477
What I want is to be writing poems,
but life keeps getting in the way.

13:30.561 --> 13:33.730
Yeah. Yeah, life is messy like that.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.445
There are poems
that I wanna write for you.

13:42.614 --> 13:43.907
Okay, Emily.

13:44.825 --> 13:45.868
But--

13:45.951 --> 13:49.329
But what if I need more than your poems?

13:51.248 --> 13:55.210
What if right now I need all of you?

14:01.300 --> 14:03.886
Babysitters club at your service.

14:03.969 --> 14:07.222
-Hey, look at that. You have help.
-Yeah.

14:07.306 --> 14:10.559
'Cause nothing says "free domestic labor"
like "adopted cousins."

14:49.973 --> 14:53.101
Remember to flatten your seams

14:53.977 --> 14:56.188
and overlap the raw edges.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.942
Very nice, Abiah.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.569
Good work there, Mrs. Dickinson.

15:02.653 --> 15:05.197
The soldiers are going to appreciate
that pillowcase.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.657
Oh, thank you.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.743
But this isn't for the soldiers.
It's for my grandson.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.080
Hopefully one day I'll be able
to give it to him in person.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.792
-Mom, I tried. Okay?
-Not hard enough.

15:16.875 --> 15:20.379
Sue isn't letting Mrs. Dickinson
spend time with the baby.

15:20.462 --> 15:23.590
Okay, I live for the hot goss
I get at these sewing circles.

15:23.674 --> 15:27.052
Do you know what I would give
to hold my first and only grandson?

15:27.135 --> 15:29.596
To hear him call me "Grandmother"?

15:30.138 --> 15:31.390
Or maybe "Grammy."

15:31.473 --> 15:35.936
-Or "Gigi." Or maybe "Cookie."
-The baby doesn't even have a name yet.

15:36.019 --> 15:39.147
But when they give him a name,
don't you think he should call me Cookie?

15:39.231 --> 15:40.607
-It's more youthful.
-Yes.

15:40.691 --> 15:45.195
Speaking of babies,
I can't believe Jane moved to Vietnam.

15:45.279 --> 15:48.115
-I already got a letter from her.
-Oh, my God. What does it say?

15:48.198 --> 15:51.076
She brought maple syrup
to a restaurant in Saigon

15:51.159 --> 15:53.287
and made people put it on their dumplings.

15:53.370 --> 15:56.081
Called it "New England-Asian fusion."

15:56.582 --> 15:57.916
She's so canceled.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.961
Emily, what are you doing?
You're wasting good muslin.

16:01.044 --> 16:04.089
Sorry, the thread just kinda took over.

16:04.173 --> 16:06.008
I thought you said you wanted to help.

16:06.091 --> 16:09.386
Yeah. No soldier's going to be
able to wrap their wound in that.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.221
I told you guys. I can't sew.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.390
Then tear the stitches out
and start again.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.100
We can't waste good muslin.

16:16.310 --> 16:18.312
I wish I was more like a spider.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.646
Excuse me?

16:21.064 --> 16:23.192
A Spider sewed at Night

16:23.275 --> 16:25.194
Without a Light

16:25.277 --> 16:27.487
Upon an Arc of White.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.865
That's so poetic.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.283
Yes, because it's a poem.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.911
-Ah…
-Just keep sewing, Emily.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.705
Beautiful edgework, Vinnie.

16:36.788 --> 16:40.042
Where did you get that fabric?
It has such a lovely sheen.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.544
I'm tearing up my old dresses
to make bandages.

16:43.253 --> 16:47.007
Hard to believe I used to wear
these dresses to look good for my suitors.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.884
Now the closest I'll ever get to a man is

16:48.967 --> 16:52.638
if he wraps his hemorrhaging leg wound
in a piece of my silk.

16:53.764 --> 16:55.641
Girl, that is dark.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.602
Personally, I never thought
the war would last this long.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.437
It seems utterly endless.

17:00.521 --> 17:05.108
I know. It's like…
America was only founded 100 years ago.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.653
Is this the end of it? Already?

17:07.736 --> 17:11.365
Can we lighten the mood here?
Does anyone have more tea?

17:11.990 --> 17:14.284
Tea? Oh, I didn't know you wanted some.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.411
Girls, go make some tea.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.997
No, I mean, like, "the tea,"

17:19.080 --> 17:20.958
the gossip, the dirt.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.670
Here's some tea. For every three soldiers
that are killed in the battlefield,

17:24.752 --> 17:26.255
another five die of disease.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.175
And of those five,
all of them had wives, and girlfriends,

17:30.259 --> 17:32.845
and ex-girlfriends who never stopped
being attracted to them.

17:32.928 --> 17:35.848
They just weren't in the right headspace
for a relationship at the time.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.808
This is all about Ship and Joseph Lyman.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.394
Joseph Lyman died
fighting for the Confederacy.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.355
-We're not ready for that conversation?
-Is that true?

17:43.438 --> 17:45.399
Ow! Why are needles so sharp?

17:45.482 --> 17:48.819
Emily, if you can't sew,
then knit something.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.697
I'm just not made
for traditional feminine handicrafts.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.532
Emily, we all need to do our part.

17:53.615 --> 17:54.825
Yes, you need to help.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.410
I'm trying to help!

17:56.493 --> 17:58.036
All day I've been trying,

17:58.120 --> 18:00.706
but nothing I do seems to be
making anything any better.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.833
We're not mending the real wounds anyway.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.918
What do you mean by that?

18:05.002 --> 18:08.505
I mean the pain that lies
in people's hearts.

18:09.715 --> 18:13.427
The violence, the hatred,
the suffering in their souls.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.637
That's what I want to heal.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.556
With my poetry.

18:18.182 --> 18:21.476
-Good luck with that.
-What, you think poetry doesn't matter?

18:22.144 --> 18:26.523
Question for the group:
Who's the greatest living poet in America?

18:26.607 --> 18:29.026
-Walt Whitman.
-Correct.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.403
And what's Walt Whitman doing these days?

18:32.154 --> 18:34.990
He's a freaking nurse in a field hospital.

18:35.991 --> 18:39.870
Because even Walt Whitman realizes
that his words don't matter right now.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.206
What matters are his actions,

18:42.289 --> 18:45.667
the work he's doing on the ground
to help his fellow man.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.669
I'm not sure I agree.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.923
We publish poetry in Drum Beat.

18:51.465 --> 18:55.385
That's the Union newspaper
my husband and I are running

18:55.469 --> 18:58.805
under the leadership
of Abraham Lincoln himself.

18:58.889 --> 19:01.475
We get it.
Your husband has met the president.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.311
Lincoln says we're doing
great things for the Union.

19:04.394 --> 19:08.398
And soldiers love Drum Beat.
They even read it on their deathbeds.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.400
See?
Poetry can bring comfort to a dying man.

19:10.484 --> 19:13.320
Oh, and that's all you want to do?
Give people comfort?

19:13.403 --> 19:17.032
Sorry, but I think we should be
making people uncomfortable.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.576
I think we should be taking
our rage to the streets.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.704
Women deserve the right to vote.
We need to explicitly demand

19:22.788 --> 19:25.415
that the constitution invoke
the rights of female persons,

19:25.499 --> 19:29.753
and we need to not tell my husband
that I am saying any of this.

19:29.837 --> 19:32.422
You can take that kind of talk
right out of my dining room.

19:32.506 --> 19:34.007
Well, I think poetry can help.

19:34.633 --> 19:36.218
Or least I hope it can.

19:37.261 --> 19:39.179
Otherwise my life is
pretty much meaningless.

19:39.263 --> 19:40.681
I think Emily is right.

19:40.764 --> 19:41.974
Betty, go on.

19:45.769 --> 19:49.147
Uh, Henry is a writer.

19:49.231 --> 19:54.444
I blamed him for putting his writing
ahead of our family.

19:54.528 --> 19:57.406
And it's true, it tore our family apart.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.242
But then it…

20:01.702 --> 20:04.162
His writing stitched us
back together again.

20:06.498 --> 20:11.211
The letters that he writes Helen,
that he used to write…

20:13.589 --> 20:15.674
They became her only source of hope.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.261
God, I don't know what I'm gonna do

20:19.344 --> 20:21.805
if Helen doesn't get
another one of those letters.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.167
So…

20:51.710 --> 20:55.714
Yes, I do believe in the power of writing.

20:58.467 --> 21:00.552
Sometimes it's all we really have.

21:01.178 --> 21:04.014
That's right. That's right, Betty.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.433
And writing is what I'm good at.

21:07.601 --> 21:11.104
So what if I can't sew or knit?
Or hold newborn babies?

21:11.188 --> 21:14.942
Or fix all the messy relationships
in my family? So what?

21:15.526 --> 21:22.366
The best thing that I can do for the world
is lock myself away and write poetry.

21:23.033 --> 21:25.619
But what good are your poems gonna be
if you do that?

21:27.788 --> 21:28.789
What?

21:28.872 --> 21:30.624
If you can't handle the mess of the world,

21:30.707 --> 21:34.044
why would anyone need to hear
what you have to say?

21:36.129 --> 21:39.466
Writing that shuts real life out…

21:41.385 --> 21:43.178
is as good as dead.

21:50.102 --> 21:52.062
Well, maybe we should get back to sewing

21:52.145 --> 21:55.816
because hundreds of eligible babes are out
there getting their legs blown off. So--

21:56.942 --> 21:58.569
My leg!

21:58.652 --> 22:00.529
-Incoming. Got an injury here.
-Austin?

22:00.612 --> 22:02.197
-What's all this noise?
-Are you okay?

22:02.281 --> 22:03.991
-The bastard got me!
-What happened?

22:04.074 --> 22:07.202
We got into a teensy-tiny bar fight.
There were broken bottles flying around.

22:07.286 --> 22:10.664
-One of them cut Austin's leg.
-My God. He's bleeding.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.791
My son! My son is wounded!

22:12.875 --> 22:13.959
Go get the bandages!

22:14.042 --> 22:15.627
But those are for the soldiers.

22:15.711 --> 22:17.462
-Austin, sit.
-Oh, Jane.

22:17.546 --> 22:20.048
-Sit down.
-Oh! Where-- Where-- Where is Jane?

22:20.132 --> 22:23.093
-Jane!
-How much have you had to drink?

22:23.177 --> 22:25.137
Not enough to drown my sorrows.

22:25.971 --> 22:28.557
-Austin, listen to me. I have good news.
-No.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.808
-Good news?
-Yes.

22:29.892 --> 22:32.227
Did the boat turn around? Is Jane back?

22:32.311 --> 22:35.022
-No. No, no, no. Shh. Listen to me.
-No! Mrs. Dickinson…

22:35.105 --> 22:37.357
-Dad forgives you.
-Huh?

22:38.233 --> 22:41.403
Yeah, I-- I talked to him,
and he's not angry with you, not at all.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.822
-He's really taking the high road.
-We've been here all day.

22:43.906 --> 22:46.658
And even though you said
all of those awful things,

22:46.742 --> 22:47.951
he's not holding a grudge.

22:48.035 --> 22:49.494
He's totally ready to move on.

22:49.578 --> 22:51.246
Wow.

22:52.039 --> 22:54.333
Then he's even more of an asshole
than I thought.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.503
Austin, how can you say that?

22:58.378 --> 23:01.798
He's just trying to deny my feelings
like he always has.

23:01.882 --> 23:06.178
Of course, Dad would love to say
that there's no problem between us.

23:06.261 --> 23:08.222
That's because the problem is him.

23:08.931 --> 23:11.391
Well, I don't give a shit what he thinks.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.685
I'm still seceding from this family!

23:13.769 --> 23:15.979
-Out of my way. My son is suffering.
-No.

23:16.063 --> 23:18.690
But, Mrs. Dickinson, those are for the U--

23:19.316 --> 23:23.153
Oh, my poor boy. Just let me nurse you.

23:23.237 --> 23:24.988
That's right, Mama's got you now.

23:25.072 --> 23:26.490
You call this seceding?

23:26.573 --> 23:29.076
-Jane.
-Emily, get him some water. Try to help.

23:30.953 --> 23:31.954
Jane.

23:48.762 --> 23:49.763
Come in.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.809
Hey, Emily. Is it okay if I come in?

23:53.892 --> 23:57.271
George, you're not supposed to--
Okay, cool. Cool, yep, you're in my room.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.439
Whew. Sorry about all that ruckus.

24:00.190 --> 24:04.361
-I did not mean to cause such a commotion.
-George, it's very late. Why are you here?

24:04.862 --> 24:09.199
I-- I wanted to give you something.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.161
The Atlantic?

24:13.245 --> 24:15.622
There's an article in there
I thought you might like.

24:15.706 --> 24:19.001
"Letter to a Young Contributor."
It's advice for young poets.

24:19.084 --> 24:20.878
By Thomas Wentworth Higginson.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.548
Higginson the abolitionist?

24:24.631 --> 24:27.092
Yeah. Dude is so cool.

24:27.176 --> 24:30.470
Did you know he was one of the Secret Six
that funded John Brown's uprising?

24:30.554 --> 24:33.599
Now he's down south, fighting the war.

24:34.224 --> 24:37.144
Leading the Union's very first regiment
of Black soldiers.

24:38.437 --> 24:39.813
Long journey?

24:39.897 --> 24:41.064
Long as hell.

24:41.857 --> 24:43.317
But I got here.

24:44.818 --> 24:46.069
That's all that matters.

24:47.654 --> 24:50.699
So he's out there in the heat of battle,

24:50.782 --> 24:53.285
and he still finds time
to care about poetry.

24:53.368 --> 24:56.997
I mean… it's pretty rad.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.123
That's amazing.

24:58.207 --> 25:00.250
I will definitely check it out.
Thank you, George.

25:01.001 --> 25:03.712
Yeah, I mean,
take it or leave it.

25:03.795 --> 25:05.964
I'm sure no one can really
give you advice anyway.

25:06.048 --> 25:08.175
You're on a whole other level.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.178
That's-- That's nice of you to say.

25:11.803 --> 25:14.723
Well, you know I've always been
your biggest fan.

25:19.019 --> 25:21.563
I guess I've just been feeling
like my poems don't even matter.

25:21.647 --> 25:23.232
What? That's crazy.

25:24.942 --> 25:29.238
With everything going on,
in the world and in my family…

25:31.073 --> 25:33.659
maybe it'd be better for everyone
if I just stopped writing.

25:33.742 --> 25:35.827
Writing is what you were put
on this earth to do.

25:35.911 --> 25:37.996
Is it, though?

25:38.080 --> 25:41.917
Maybe I need to be doing more
to really help.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.961
All I know is this.

25:44.044 --> 25:47.714
If I had to choose
between you and your poems?

25:47.798 --> 25:48.799
Yeah?

25:49.341 --> 25:51.051
I'd choose your poems.

25:54.012 --> 25:57.140
Okay, that's actually
the sweetest thing you could ever say.

26:01.103 --> 26:03.146
-George, what are you doing? George?
-I-- Oh, uh.

26:03.230 --> 26:05.941
I just thought maybe
with the war going on and everything--

26:06.024 --> 26:07.609
George, I can't.

26:09.570 --> 26:13.240
My heart belongs to someone else.

26:14.241 --> 26:15.242
Oh.

26:16.952 --> 26:18.704
God, life is messy, isn't it?

26:37.556 --> 26:40.309
Betty's back. There's my bad bitch.

26:40.392 --> 26:45.272
Sojourner. That dress is the truth.

26:45.355 --> 26:47.983
Oh, they're gonna know
I'm a woman in this dress.

26:48.066 --> 26:51.445
Yes, they will. They will know
that you are the great Sojourner Truth,

26:51.528 --> 26:55.324
abolitionist, evangelist,
fighter for suffrage--

26:55.407 --> 26:57.284
And famously single.

26:58.118 --> 27:00.913
Wait. Where's your quill pen,
you multitalented bad bitch?

27:00.996 --> 27:02.414
Let's get back to work.

27:02.497 --> 27:08.086
I do want to keep transcribing
your memoir, but I'm just so tired.

27:08.170 --> 27:14.426
Betty, if I can be the first Black woman
to sue a white man in court and win,

27:14.510 --> 27:18.263
you can stay awake one more night to write
my next chapter, about how I did that.

27:19.139 --> 27:20.682
Okay. Okay!

27:22.559 --> 27:24.394
-Yes, you're right.
-Yeah.

27:24.478 --> 27:27.564
We gotta keep fighting. Can't give up.

27:27.648 --> 27:29.274
-That's what Henry used to say.
-That's right.

27:29.358 --> 27:32.694
Because I'm not gonna die.
No, I'm going home like a shooting star.

27:32.778 --> 27:35.072
Watch me light up the night
with my energy.

27:35.155 --> 27:36.907
Can you believe I'm 60?

27:36.990 --> 27:40.077
We don't know your exact birth date.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.497
Betty, I'm roughly 66,
and I look good as hell.

27:45.207 --> 27:46.708
Now. Where were we?

27:46.792 --> 27:50.629
They just illegally sold
your five-year-old son

27:50.712 --> 27:52.756
to a planter in Alabama.

27:52.840 --> 27:56.134
White people are the devil. Let's narrate.

28:01.640 --> 28:06.895
Writing that shuts real life out
is as good as dead.

28:31.879 --> 28:33.297
Mr. Higginson,

28:34.006 --> 28:37.634
Are you too deeply occupied
to say if my Verse is alive?
