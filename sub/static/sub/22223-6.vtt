WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.791
Previously on Farscape.

00:02.879 --> 00:07.213
Noranti:
Aeryn is with child.

00:07.300 --> 00:08.540
Still obsessed, | see.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.215
Did she say anything to you
before she left?

00:10.303 --> 00:12.089
I finally figured
out wormholes.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.169
You did it.

00:13.264 --> 00:14.800
All that wormhole nonsense.

00:14.891 --> 00:16.722
Yeah. I can get you home.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.310
There she is.

00:21.272 --> 00:24.355
Pilot. Moya looks beautiful.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.106
Aeryn.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.355
You've come back.

00:29.030 --> 00:31.021
I've got Heat Delirium.

00:31.115 --> 00:32.446
Who saved your life? Who?

00:32.533 --> 00:33.488
Idid.

00:33.576 --> 00:34.736
He wants asylum.

00:34.827 --> 00:35.657
No!

00:35.745 --> 00:37.110
You're buried. You're dead.

00:37.205 --> 00:40.288
I gave my word that he
would not be harmed.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.659
Put your weapons down.

00:41.751 --> 00:45.790
We ask you to choose
one spokesperson.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.541
You mean, just pick a captain?

00:47.632 --> 00:49.418
Yes.

00:49.508 --> 00:53.592
So, you could tell me...
you were pregnant.

01:02.813 --> 01:05.976
And now on Farscape.

01:06.067 --> 01:09.150
(stringed instrument
being tuned )

01:09.237 --> 01:12.104
Rygel:
We are sitting at a dead stop
in the middle of nothing

01:12.198 --> 01:17.238
because Crichton thinks he can
smell a wormhole about to open?

01:19.664 --> 01:22.997
Does anyone else find this
vaguely preposterous?

01:23.084 --> 01:26.451
We promised him two arns.
We'll give him two arns.

01:26.545 --> 01:27.671
Captain.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.246
You had your turn and
now it's mine.

01:30.341 --> 01:35.301
Until we elect a permanent
captain, I demand the same
respect and obedience...

01:35.388 --> 01:36.548
( off-tune chords )
Aah!

01:36.639 --> 01:37.719
( growls )

01:37.807 --> 01:39.217
( groans )

01:39.308 --> 01:42.516
Why did you construct another
of those hideous instruments?

01:42.603 --> 01:44.935
My bowels make better music.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.434
(instrument tuning)

01:47.525 --> 01:49.607
Hey. How's it coming?

01:49.694 --> 01:53.437
D'Argo:
Almost finished. I'm close to
balancing harmonics across the difficult setra chords.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.192
Not you, you ripnitz.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.898
Has Crichton found
any wormholes?

01:56.993 --> 01:58.278
Ba boom.

01:59.412 --> 02:02.154
Wormhole in...

02:02.248 --> 02:04.204
Diez...

02:04.292 --> 02:05.532
Nueve...

02:05.626 --> 02:09.244
Does that nixer really
annoy you?
-Ocho...

02:09.338 --> 02:10.544
Siete...

02:10.631 --> 02:11.666
No.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.214
Seis...

02:14.760 --> 02:17.137
Cinco...

02:17.513 --> 02:21.131
Quatro...

02:21.225 --> 02:23.511
Tres...

02:23.602 --> 02:25.513
Dos...

02:25.604 --> 02:27.219
Uno.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.563
( exhales )

02:37.199 --> 02:39.281
Tear out page 42.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.993
We're sorry, Commander.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.456
Oh, you know, Pilot.

02:44.540 --> 02:47.373
You and Moya hate wormholes,
but thanks for sayin' so.

02:47.460 --> 02:48.700
Do you know what you did wrong?

02:48.794 --> 02:51.410
You mean other than getting
up this morning?

02:54.342 --> 02:55.752
Have at it, Cap.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.832
Knock yourself out.

02:56.927 --> 02:57.791
Uh...

02:57.887 --> 03:00.003
Your orders, Captain Rygel?

03:00.097 --> 03:01.212
Have you chosen a flight vector?

03:01.307 --> 03:04.094
Rygel:
Give me another microt
with this miserably...

03:04.185 --> 03:06.597
Would you excuse us?

03:08.564 --> 03:11.351
Can I speak to you?

03:11.442 --> 03:14.479
Quite a few things I'd
like to say.

03:14.570 --> 03:17.653
There's a lot of things
I'd like to hear.

03:17.740 --> 03:21.153
I'd offer to buy you
a drink, but...

03:21.243 --> 03:22.949
My quarters.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.830
(loud rumbling)

03:28.709 --> 03:29.698
Frell.

03:29.794 --> 03:31.534
Sikozu:
Crichton...

03:31.629 --> 03:35.121
Rygel:
I don't believe it.
It's a frelling wormhole.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.296
Chiana:
Look at that.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.794
D'Argo:
Well done, John.

03:41.305 --> 03:44.342
Rygel:
The frelnik actually
predicted a wormhole.

03:44.433 --> 03:45.513
(Chiana laughing)
You did it.

03:45.601 --> 03:49.310
Hey, now there's three
of us who like you.

03:49.397 --> 03:55.188
Pilot:
Commander, this wormhole is a
great deal larger and closer than your assurances.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.188
Back it on up, Pilot.
Anything you want.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.610
( Rygel clears throat)

03:58.697 --> 04:02.440
Excuse me, but there is a chain
of command in place.

04:02.535 --> 04:04.491
Whatever, Sparky. Rock on.

04:04.578 --> 04:08.491
All right, Pilot, I think that
under the circumstances...

04:08.582 --> 04:10.368
that yes, I agree, we should...

04:10.459 --> 04:11.699
(rumbling, explosions)

04:11.794 --> 04:13.580
(yelling)

04:16.340 --> 04:17.420
( screaming )

04:17.508 --> 04:19.248
(moaning)

04:20.010 --> 04:20.920
You all right?
-Yeah.

04:21.011 --> 04:21.966
What hit us?
-Don't know.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.669
Can you move?
-My arm!

04:24.557 --> 04:26.639
What happened to the stars?

04:28.978 --> 04:31.685
What happened to the stars?!

04:36.235 --> 04:40.148
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:40.239 --> 04:43.982
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.862
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

04:45.953 --> 04:49.195
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

04:49.290 --> 04:51.030
my friends.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.912
I've made enemies.

04:54.003 --> 04:57.245
Powerful, dangerous.

04:57.339 --> 05:00.831
Now all I want is to
find a way home

05:00.926 --> 05:03.668
to warn Earth.

05:03.762 --> 05:08.847
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.416
Rygel:
Budongl It's gotta be a budong!

05:43.511 --> 05:44.967
Unlikely. We're not moving.

05:45.054 --> 05:47.090
Sikozu:
There's nothing.
Everything's blown.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.671
Crichton:
Pilot, be there.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.882
D'Argo:
Okay, I've secured a patch but
it won't last long. Sikozu!

05:50.976 --> 05:52.011
When I'm done here.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.137
(groaning)

05:53.229 --> 05:56.141
There are no stars.
It's the... the Flax.

05:56.232 --> 05:58.063
The wormhole got us.
We're gonna die.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.105
Hey, Captain Chaos...

05:59.193 --> 06:00.774
(grunting)

06:00.861 --> 06:02.362
Try comms now.

06:02.446 --> 06:05.313
Crichton:
Pilote. Como estas, hombre?

06:05.407 --> 06:07.113
Commander, are you all right?

06:07.201 --> 06:10.318
A little south of that.
What the hell is goin' on?
-Undetermined.

06:10.412 --> 06:15.202
Moya's convulsing unlike
anything I have
experienced before.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.828
And therein lies our problem.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.534
It's not his fault, Sputnik.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.837
Yes, it's probably yours!

06:21.924 --> 06:22.959
He wasn't the captain.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.130
( Rygel grunting )

06:24.218 --> 06:25.128
Pilot, what did we hit?

06:25.219 --> 06:26.334
Nothing.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.259
We weren't moving at
the time were we?

06:28.347 --> 06:31.760
Correct. Something hit us.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.715
Well, what you frell-wit?!

06:33.811 --> 06:35.517
There aren't any stars.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.516
l have no external readings.

06:38.607 --> 06:42.566
Not a single sense neuron on
Moya's skin is transmitting.

06:42.653 --> 06:44.268
That cannot be right.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.273
( explosion )

06:45.364 --> 06:46.774
(yelling)

06:48.117 --> 06:50.449
It is, you disagreeable...

06:50.536 --> 06:52.117
How can that be right, Pilot?

06:52.204 --> 06:56.322
Something is attacking Moya
across all exposed surfaces.

06:56.417 --> 06:59.625
Her skin is burning
everywhere at once.

06:59.712 --> 07:01.293
Well, what do we do?

07:01.380 --> 07:05.373
Under the circumstances a hull
breach will go undetected.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.048
Perimeter hull search.

07:07.136 --> 07:08.421
Interior.
-With Chiana?

07:08.512 --> 07:10.753
Yeah.
-With ya.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.679
( explosion )

07:12.766 --> 07:14.267
(groaning)

07:14.351 --> 07:16.262
Has anyone heard from Scorpius?

07:16.353 --> 07:18.309
Scorpius, are you all right?

07:18.397 --> 07:19.682
(sighing)

07:19.773 --> 07:21.388
Physically, yes.

07:21.483 --> 07:25.271
However, I would appreciate
being let out of this cell...

07:25.362 --> 07:27.318
Absolutely not!

07:27.406 --> 07:28.236
Grandmama?

07:28.324 --> 07:31.407
Yo, School Lunch Lady,
you there?

07:33.370 --> 07:34.655
Great, we got an MIA.

07:34.747 --> 07:36.203
Don't have time to
look right now.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.576
D, how about a little
space walk?

07:39.418 --> 07:41.374
(quietly):
Ver...

07:42.296 --> 07:44.457
Verdure?

07:45.841 --> 07:47.797
( gasps ):
Verdure.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.417
(clattering )

07:51.430 --> 07:54.046
Herbage... Flora...

07:56.935 --> 07:58.311
Herbage.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.812
Flora.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.478
Plant!

08:10.324 --> 08:13.487
Hmm, what kind of plant
lives in space?

08:13.577 --> 08:16.535
What kind of plant can
grab a Leviathan?

08:20.376 --> 08:23.288
D'Argo:
I've never seen anything like
this before, have you?

08:23.379 --> 08:27.042
Crichton:
D, it wasn't that long ago
I hadn't heard of you.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.124
Looks like Glinda was right.

08:30.219 --> 08:33.211
We got some kinda
weird plant, man.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.682
Can you see any stars
through its vegetation?

08:35.766 --> 08:39.304
Nah. It's pretty damn deep.

08:39.395 --> 08:42.228
We're going to take
some samples.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.396
( squeaking )

08:46.777 --> 08:51.237
Scorpius:
I suspect inopportune timing,
but I require some assistance.

08:51.323 --> 08:54.110
You are not getting out
of that cell, Scorpius.

08:54.201 --> 09:00.242
No doubt. However, I believe the
fire will not honor that edict.

09:00.332 --> 09:01.617
I'm on my way, Scorpius.

09:01.709 --> 09:02.824
Chiana:
Hey.

09:07.423 --> 09:08.287
(gun cocking)

09:08.382 --> 09:10.919
What... are you doing?

09:11.009 --> 09:14.467
Fire on a ship is our
number one priority, Chiana.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.921
I just happened to
get here first.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.425
He's a prisoner.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.132
Door stays closed.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.185
Does he look like he's
trying to escape?

09:23.272 --> 09:24.352
Out.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.600
Out!

09:25.691 --> 09:27.272
(sighs)

09:32.990 --> 09:35.276
Okay.
(yells )

09:35.367 --> 09:36.777
(door closing )

09:36.869 --> 09:39.030
Chiana:
I know you think you're
pretty smart.

09:39.121 --> 09:42.238
But we know Scorpius
better than you do.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.993
He probably set that fire.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.291
Scorpius:
Look down the passageway.

09:46.378 --> 09:51.793
If I can start fires, I am
most proficient at it.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.928
Frell!

09:58.015 --> 09:59.505
There's fires everywhere.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.057
(extinguisher being
discharged )

10:03.479 --> 10:06.391
It's oozing some kind of gunk
dissolving the metal.

10:06.482 --> 10:09.974
Pilot says Moya's fluids are
rushing in to protect
internal organs.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.354
It's causing ruptures
everywhere.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.687
This stuff is killing my eyes.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.443
How come it's not
killing your eyes?

10:16.533 --> 10:17.693
It's like an onion. We'll live.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.525
We've got to get it
off Moya's skin.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.609
You know what?
-What?

10:20.704 --> 10:22.990
We'll blast it off with Lo'La.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.158
Hold it steady.

10:28.253 --> 10:32.121
I am trying, but it's not
responding. I need more
of your DNA.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.171
( spitting )

10:33.258 --> 10:36.045
You know, I hate this ship.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.125
( bleeping )

10:37.221 --> 10:38.836
It's messy.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.598
D'Argo:
Whoa.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.309
Pilot:
How bad is the situation?

10:54.404 --> 10:56.190
Do we tell 'em the truth?

10:56.281 --> 10:57.316
Uh-uh.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.570
Truthfully, Pilot, it's nothing
we can't handle.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.697
We'll get back to you later
on the details.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.278
And we are off the air.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.329
(rumbling)

11:06.416 --> 11:11.206
Every measure I take is soon
overcome by Moya's pain.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.911
How did you miss the plant?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.166
I didn't.

11:14.258 --> 11:17.466
We assumed it was debris,
and quite far away.

11:17.553 --> 11:21.011
When the wormhole distracted
us, it snuck up.

11:21.098 --> 11:24.306
Why should a plant be floating
so far out here?

11:24.393 --> 11:25.724
I don't know.
We'll worry about that later.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.722
Just don't give up.

11:27.813 --> 11:29.769
Aeryn?

11:29.857 --> 11:36.023
If too much of Moya's skin
becomes irreparably damaged,

11:36.113 --> 11:39.321
she will not recover.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.779
We'll fix it.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.039
One last chance.
You wanna wait for...

11:49.126 --> 11:52.118
What? So Noranti can tell us
how to make a great salad? No.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.793
See plant. Kill plant.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.167
That's gotta be on the
Luxan coat of arms.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.214
I don't suppose you have
a better idea?

11:58.302 --> 11:59.132
Nope.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.336
Well, then hold it steady.

12:03.682 --> 12:06.048
(air hissing)

12:13.191 --> 12:14.977
Leak?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.525
Scalon vapor return duct.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.070
Can linger in your bloodstream.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.070
Never stopped you before.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.201
Yeah, well this time
I'm pregnant.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.923
Before or...

12:41.011 --> 12:42.967
or after you left Moya?

12:43.055 --> 12:44.135
Before.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.474
Does Crichton know?

12:46.558 --> 12:47.764
Mm.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.307
Nice.

12:49.394 --> 12:53.888
What he doesn't know is that
it may not be his.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.391
(rumbling)

12:58.487 --> 13:01.024
Oh, you, you mean the
other Crichton.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.324
Somebody...

13:09.414 --> 13:11.154
somebody else?

13:11.249 --> 13:13.581
Possibly.

13:13.669 --> 13:18.288
I only found out on the Command
Carrier and I haven't had it
DNA tested yet.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.424
(sighs)

13:25.847 --> 13:27.712
Your life is...

13:27.808 --> 13:30.345
is so much more interesting
than mine.

13:35.941 --> 13:37.351
Can I trust you?

13:39.361 --> 13:40.817
Yeah.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.361
ldon't want you to tell John.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.231
No way.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.284
Never. Never. That's...
that's your speech.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.829
Come here.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.037
Okay.

13:57.129 --> 14:00.246
If I have calculated the
plant depth correctly,

14:00.340 --> 14:03.958
we'll be able to burn right
through it without Moya
feeling a thing.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.508
Any news from the candy kitchen?

14:05.595 --> 14:07.722
Sikozu:
Nothing unexpected.

14:07.806 --> 14:14.052
The plant secretes an acid that
dissolves certain types of
metal which it then ingests.

14:14.146 --> 14:18.355
The burning in your eyes
is due to a waste gas.

14:18.442 --> 14:21.229
Must go a long time
in between meals.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.024
No, not really.
Think of your wormholes.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.902
Every time it opens, the sudden
gravitational presence...

14:27.993 --> 14:30.075
Draws the debris towards it.

14:30.162 --> 14:32.494
Yes. I would... I would think.

14:32.581 --> 14:35.288
(whispering ):
She's too smart.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.993
Okay, I'm initiating the
firing sequence.

14:42.090 --> 14:42.954
Hmm...

14:43.050 --> 14:45.507
( screaming )

14:49.306 --> 14:50.261
What is it?

14:50.348 --> 14:52.839
Eat... eats...

14:52.934 --> 14:54.185
Cry... tears...

14:54.269 --> 14:55.258
Cry... grow...

14:55.353 --> 14:57.560
I can't understand.
-tears...

14:57.647 --> 14:58.602
You ready?

14:58.690 --> 14:59.600
Mm.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.227
What is it? I can't understand.

15:01.318 --> 15:01.977
Eat...

15:02.069 --> 15:04.276
John,

15:04.362 --> 15:07.570
I'm going to tell you something
I've never actually put into
words before.

15:09.201 --> 15:12.238
I love shooting things.

15:15.207 --> 15:17.243
Don't shoot the plant!

15:23.548 --> 15:27.541
You know what?
I'm very good at it.
( laughing )

15:27.636 --> 15:30.252
Sikozu:
Crichton, D'Argo,
hold you fire.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.462
Stars...

15:31.556 --> 15:32.671
Hold you fire.

15:32.766 --> 15:36.350
Can you hear me?
I repeat hold you fire.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.302
See? They didn't even feel it.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.139
Sikozu:
Do not shoot the plant.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.319
I repeat, do not
shoot the plant.

15:50.575 --> 15:53.362
Well, if it was so important,
she should have spoken
up sooner.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.114
I tried.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.912
Crichton:
Back up. You say it's gonna eat
faster if it's attacked?

15:57.999 --> 16:01.332
lt ate its way through the pot
rather than be cooked.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.499
Wouldn't you?

16:02.587 --> 16:04.839
D'Argo:
I didn't boil the plant,
I shot it.

16:04.923 --> 16:05.958
It's dead.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.210
Then why do my eyes
still sting?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.461
D, your eyes bugging you?

16:09.553 --> 16:11.919
(snons)

16:12.472 --> 16:14.963
That's a yes.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.639
Pilot, how's Moya?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.682
No change, Officer Sun.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.557
Perhaps a slight worsening.

16:21.648 --> 16:25.482
She cannot localize the
sensations but she still
feels the burning.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.810
What's that?

16:34.870 --> 16:37.486
D'Argo:
Just a couple of dead roots.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.032
Ah!

16:48.592 --> 16:49.923
Aeryn:
Doesn't look dead to me.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.422
D'Argo:
It has to be. I killed it.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.674
Pilot:
Moya's pain is increasing.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.630
What is happening?

17:02.647 --> 17:04.512
It's in the frelling ship.

17:04.608 --> 17:08.601
The plant is in the
frelling ship.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.356
Pilot, how far has it spread?

17:10.447 --> 17:12.813
(groans):
I can't tell.

17:12.908 --> 17:14.648
Moya's senses are overloaded.

17:14.743 --> 17:17.109
It could be anywhere.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.819
We'll get it out, Pilot.

17:18.914 --> 17:21.701
I found two of these.
Is that helping you at all?

17:21.791 --> 17:26.000
Not much. For once in my life,
I wish I had your
inferior noses.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.294
Pip, how you doing in there?

17:30.217 --> 17:33.459
I'm... I'm not going up
there again.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.761
Can you send... send Rygel
next time, okay?

17:38.975 --> 17:40.761
I'm not doing that.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.935
I want... I want my weapons
and I want my comm.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.512
They're right here.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.222
Thank... thank you.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.228
Here.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.401
What did you see?

17:52.864 --> 17:54.855
What'd | see?

17:54.950 --> 17:57.942
Was plant. Everywhere.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.573
Up one tier, down...
down two tiers.

18:00.664 --> 18:03.246
As far as you can see.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.116
( screams ):
It's okay...

18:06.211 --> 18:07.621
It's... it's my clothes.
It's my clothes.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.327
Here, come down.
-|t's in my clothes.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.128
Aeryn:
All right, calm down.
It's not going to hurt you.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.207
lt eats through metal,
not flesh.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.165
lt... it itches.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.003
All right, I'll help you.
-It itches.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.969
It's all through the ship.
It's my fault.

18:22.060 --> 18:25.473
Oh well, we all signed off
on the plan.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.224
It's probably the first time
that's happened.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.273
If we screwed up.
We all screwed up.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.351
Come on.

18:37.701 --> 18:41.319
Rygel:
Pilot, what the yotz is wrong
with the lights?

18:41.413 --> 18:43.199
I don't know.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.030
Well that's hardly good
enough, is it?

18:45.125 --> 18:47.366
Find the problem and fix it.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.745
( groans )

19:30.128 --> 19:32.119
D'Argo:
Chiana, put it away.

19:32.213 --> 19:35.046
It's in the bulkhead,
not frelling running around.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.169
Yeah, so far.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.466
What are you doing?

19:38.553 --> 19:40.089
Just checking to see
how far it's spread.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.637
So far it's on every
frelling tier I've looked at.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.306
You know what?
I think it's spawning.

19:45.393 --> 19:48.055
It's not the only one.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.886
You pregnant?

19:49.981 --> 19:52.973
Not me. Aeryn.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.184
Aeryn is pregnant? No.

19:56.196 --> 19:59.188
Yeah, it's the truth.

19:59.282 --> 20:00.522
I swear.

20:00.617 --> 20:01.732
Does John know?

20:01.826 --> 20:03.202
Oh, yeah.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.117
But here's one thing he
doesn't know.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.617
The nahl might not be his.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.120
But is she conceived on Talyn,
and if it's Crichton's DNA,
then it's his, isn't?

20:11.211 --> 20:14.044
Yeah, but it might not be
John Crichton's at all.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.416
Well, then who's?

20:16.800 --> 20:18.381
Good question.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.583
(sighs)

20:19.677 --> 20:21.759
Who told you this?

20:24.516 --> 20:25.926
Rygel.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.175
You can't tell anybody, okay?

20:29.270 --> 20:31.932
Hey come on, he deserves
to know.

20:32.023 --> 20:35.936
Please, swear you won't
tell anybody.

20:37.487 --> 20:38.647
D'Argo?

20:40.281 --> 20:41.987
(moaning)

20:45.203 --> 20:47.660
What is the matter with you?

20:50.667 --> 20:53.534
This Leviathan is in pain.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.293
Dying.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.171
Leviathans are good.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.921
Good things shouldn't
have to die.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.751
That's right.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.429
That's why we have to keep
working on this plant.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.223
Oh. Oh... itches.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.561
Bad to scratch.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.889
I might go blind.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.646
Oh, what to do?

21:18.736 --> 21:20.772
All right.

21:22.991 --> 21:26.154
All right. Here's what we do.

21:26.244 --> 21:33.992
We help your eye and the
Leviathan by finding a
way to kill the plant.

21:34.085 --> 21:36.201
How?

21:36.296 --> 21:38.457
However we can.

21:39.382 --> 21:41.964
Maybe a poison.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.303
:J»,§

21:47.390 --> 21:49.881
I know lots of poisons.

21:51.269 --> 21:54.636
Yes, I'm sure you do.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.434
Right?

21:57.525 --> 22:00.437
( sparking )

22:07.285 --> 22:09.241
(powering up)

22:18.671 --> 22:20.536
(chattering )

22:23.968 --> 22:25.833
(chattering continues)

22:39.359 --> 22:41.315
(sighs)

22:49.369 --> 22:50.859
Chiana:
Aeryn?

22:50.954 --> 22:52.364
I'm over here.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.820
Hey.

22:53.915 --> 22:56.531
Uh, I checked the whole lobe.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.958
There's no, uh... there's no
plant in Moya's neural tissue.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.127
She's going to be all right.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.829
It means we can save her, right?

23:02.924 --> 23:06.087
Yeah, but we still have
other lobes to check.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.087
Right.

23:07.178 --> 23:08.338
Okay.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.294
All right.

23:12.684 --> 23:13.673
Oh, Chiana.

23:13.768 --> 23:14.928
Yeah?

23:15.019 --> 23:18.136
About that conversation
that we had before.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.721
What? What conversation?

23:19.816 --> 23:22.023
The one about the, uh...

23:22.110 --> 23:23.270
Oh, the...
(clicks tongue)

23:23.361 --> 23:24.851
(clicks tongue)
Yeah.

23:24.946 --> 23:28.063
l was wondering if you
could do me a favor.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.317
Sure.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.946
Could you forget that we
had that conversation?

23:37.709 --> 23:42.703
S-sure, but you... you know,
you had to tell somebody,
so I don't...

23:42.797 --> 23:45.129
Yeah, um...

23:45.216 --> 23:48.504
now I'm... really regretting
that I did.

23:51.681 --> 23:54.047
I may not even tell him.

23:55.351 --> 23:56.761
What?

23:56.853 --> 23:58.263
Ever?

23:58.354 --> 23:59.730
Never?

23:59.814 --> 24:03.477
Well, I need to know whose
it is first, and...

24:03.568 --> 24:06.184
I can't tell him that
I don't know.

24:08.072 --> 24:12.361
So... could you just forget
that it happened?

24:15.371 --> 24:16.486
Sure.

24:16.581 --> 24:19.197
Is that okay?

24:19.292 --> 24:21.578
Yeah. Of course...
of course it is.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.205
Definitely.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.627
Thanks.

24:24.714 --> 24:26.420
I'm gonna...

24:31.888 --> 24:34.504
Oh, frell!

24:34.599 --> 24:35.554
( soft chattering )

24:35.642 --> 24:37.257
Crichton:
All right.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.806
You got me here.
What do you want?

24:40.897 --> 24:42.478
Watch.

24:48.446 --> 24:52.189
(squealing)

24:53.951 --> 24:56.203
( squeaking )

24:58.456 --> 24:59.912
Back up.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.115
Back up.

25:03.294 --> 25:04.454
Aeryn!

25:04.545 --> 25:05.455
This way.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.252
John, what is it?

25:07.340 --> 25:10.673
Seems that Audrey has taste.
She doesn't like Scorpius.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.125
To the right.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.175
What've you got?

25:13.262 --> 25:14.547
Good news as well.

25:14.639 --> 25:17.255
I can't find any traces of the
plant in the Neural Cluster.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.592
So it likes eating metal but it
doesn't like toubray tissue.

25:26.901 --> 25:29.358
Aeryn, what the hell was that?

25:30.655 --> 25:31.690
Are you okay?

25:31.781 --> 25:33.317
(gasping)

25:37.161 --> 25:38.662
Aeryn, talk to me.

25:38.746 --> 25:40.828
( explosion )

25:41.874 --> 25:43.785
Give me a microt, Crichton.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.208
Listen, Pilot, the
Neural Cluster.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.337
Pilot?

26:17.952 --> 26:20.659
( choking )

26:28.296 --> 26:30.127
Could be his cooling rods.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.125
Could just be his personality.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.332
Let's just hope it's these rods.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.338
How's the damage to Moya?

26:36.429 --> 26:38.260
Contained to a small
section of one lobe.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.338
There should not be any loss
of brain function.

26:40.433 --> 26:41.673
D'Argo:
What about the plant?

26:41.768 --> 26:43.429
Why wasn't there any in
the Neural Cluster?

26:43.519 --> 26:46.306
Because there is no metal
in the toubray.

26:46.397 --> 26:50.231
But there is metal in the
electrolyte regulators.

26:50.318 --> 26:54.357
And when they jammed,
the synapses overloaded.

26:59.368 --> 27:02.110
| wish to assist however I can.

27:02.205 --> 27:04.537
There is no need for
these restraints.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.740
I believe you. The others don't.

27:06.834 --> 27:07.823
(sighs)

27:07.919 --> 27:09.455
( squeaking )

27:09.545 --> 27:11.376
It's working.

27:12.340 --> 27:13.625
Crichton, it's working.

27:13.716 --> 27:14.922
(squealing)

27:15.009 --> 27:17.216
Yup. There you go.
We got lucky.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.214
It's definitely the rods.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.011
Is that all we have?

27:21.098 --> 27:22.349
It may not be enough.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.594
I'll see how far I can
dilute them down.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.225
John?

27:27.313 --> 27:28.928
Yeah.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.401
I know Aeryn's pregnant.

27:36.489 --> 27:39.071
Chiana told me.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.402
Chiana.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.453
Rygel told her.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.670
So the whole ship knows?

27:51.754 --> 27:54.461
Well, I don't think Moya does,
but, uh...

28:01.138 --> 28:02.799
Go ahead.

28:06.894 --> 28:11.513
Aeryn isn't sure if the child
is John Crichton's.

28:14.402 --> 28:17.189
The thought had crossed my mind.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.358
Doesn't matter.

28:24.287 --> 28:26.073
So what do you think?

28:27.832 --> 28:32.292
I think that either way,
you're going to get hurt.

28:32.795 --> 28:34.911
So, uh...

28:35.006 --> 28:37.338
look after yourself.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.305
Thanks.

28:48.477 --> 28:49.637
Oh.

28:49.729 --> 28:50.844
Hmm...

28:50.938 --> 28:54.271
We're not interested in
its flavor, you...

28:54.358 --> 28:55.393
( groans )

28:55.484 --> 28:57.099
I'm not going to insult you.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.104
No, no, no, no.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.151
It's more like hindrati
petal tea.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.606
Ooh, I can feel the fungus
dying as they mingle
in my mouth.

29:03.701 --> 29:06.534
Concentrate.

29:06.621 --> 29:10.034
We know it works as an aerosol,
but which element?

29:10.124 --> 29:11.739
Or is it the compound
as a whole?

29:11.834 --> 29:14.291
That is what we have to solve.

29:14.378 --> 29:15.959
In a casserole, no.

29:16.047 --> 29:18.754
But if stewed properly,
I believe that this plant

29:18.841 --> 29:21.298
may compliment a variety
of meat dishes.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.046
(giggles )

29:23.137 --> 29:26.425
You defy the whole theory
of natural selection.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.506
(laughs):
Do I?

29:28.601 --> 29:30.262
Listen to me.

29:30.353 --> 29:34.892
These people are trying to
save this ship and us.

29:34.982 --> 29:41.148
Now, if their plan fails, we
need to know why this works.

29:41.238 --> 29:44.071
( breathing heavily)

29:47.578 --> 29:49.239
(electrical whirring )

29:50.665 --> 29:53.327
You are here.
Why didn't you respond?

29:53.417 --> 29:55.624
You were meant to be
checking the circulation.

29:55.711 --> 29:58.123
You do it.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.079
Air flow is still functioning.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.290
John and Aeryn are clear to go.

30:02.385 --> 30:05.468
Crichton:
Let's not spill any of this
Scorpy juice. It's all we got.

30:05.554 --> 30:06.930
Got it.

30:08.516 --> 30:14.227
Rygel, you're often
insufferable.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.439
But, uh...

30:27.368 --> 30:29.074
...it's not your fault.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.493
l was Captain.

30:31.580 --> 30:35.914
Yes, you were, and, uh Pilot's
Pilot and Moya's a Leviathan.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.367
No matter what orders you give,

30:37.461 --> 30:40.123
they're not going to fly into
something they can't sense.

30:40.214 --> 30:44.173
But this plant. This fungus.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.750
Didn't register.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.881
Still...

30:47.972 --> 30:50.213
l was in charge.

30:52.018 --> 30:56.057
There are so many other reasons
why you should hate yourself
at the moment.

30:58.024 --> 31:02.313
Like sulking while others are
out there, risking their lives.

31:03.362 --> 31:07.025
Now monitor the air flow.

31:11.245 --> 31:15.238
Pilot, we gonna be okay
in there?

31:15.332 --> 31:21.953
Tiering fan filters in the
atmospheric scrubber

31:22.048 --> 31:26.166
allows a dampening of air flow.

31:26.260 --> 31:30.219
Yeah, it's all very PBS. We'll
take that as an affirmative.

31:33.309 --> 31:37.097
(fans whirring)

31:41.275 --> 31:43.061
Crichton:
So, you wanna talk?

31:44.361 --> 31:46.898
(Aeryn laughs)

31:46.989 --> 31:50.231
I appreciate you waiting for
this appropriate time and place.

31:50.326 --> 31:52.362
Yeah, I got pretty good
at waiting.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.629
I can't believe this is
all we have.

32:02.713 --> 32:05.671
Sikozu and Noranti thinned it
out as much as they could.

32:07.009 --> 32:08.465
All right. They're in position.

32:08.552 --> 32:11.259
D'Argo:
I'll let you know when the
vapor trail arrives.

32:11.347 --> 32:14.714
At the moment, all there is is
this hungry plant and my
frelling inability to breathe.

32:14.809 --> 32:17.926
Chiana:
I'm as far away from you,
Hamman side, as I can get.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.260
It doesn't look good.

32:19.355 --> 32:21.141
Crichton:
Just hang tough, Pip.

32:21.232 --> 32:22.813
It may be a little while.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.561
Rygel:
Better cut that in half.

32:24.652 --> 32:26.893
Even the DRDs have given up.

32:26.987 --> 32:29.194
The fungus is everywhere.

32:29.281 --> 32:33.775
Hopefully that'll change as
soon as this Scorpy juice
evaporates into the air stream.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.155
Aeryn:
You know we don't have
a contingency.

32:36.247 --> 32:38.613
Eh, this'll work.

32:38.707 --> 32:42.199
Unless that plant can mutate
in five minutes what
could go wrong?

32:43.003 --> 32:44.618
Damn! I did notjust say that.

32:44.713 --> 32:46.044
( screeching )

32:58.435 --> 33:00.721
Crichton:
Guys, we got a problem.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.680
The witch's brew is
down the drain.

33:06.110 --> 33:08.522
Aeryn, we got to get
out of here.

33:09.196 --> 33:10.606
Aeryn!

33:12.324 --> 33:14.110
Oh, God.

33:17.288 --> 33:19.279
Does it hurt?
-Mm-hmm.

33:19.373 --> 33:20.328
Where?

33:20.416 --> 33:22.828
Where it's bleeding.

33:22.918 --> 33:28.163
Rygel:
Crichton? When is your fahrbot
wormhole due to open again?

33:28.257 --> 33:29.337
Why?

33:29.425 --> 33:32.383
We've drifted directly atop
its coordinates.

33:32.469 --> 33:36.257
The Captain says, abandon ship.

33:37.641 --> 33:42.305
Aeryn:
D'Argo, can your vessel
pull us clear? Buy us time?

33:42.396 --> 33:45.012
Scorpius:
I hardly believe it's
worth the effort.

33:45.107 --> 33:46.517
This Leviathan is gone.

33:46.609 --> 33:49.772
Lo'la could move Moya,
but is it worth the risk?

33:49.862 --> 33:51.102
Sikozu:
Yes.

33:51.197 --> 33:54.815
This old demon has isolated
the plant-killing compound.

33:54.909 --> 33:56.865
Tell them!

33:56.952 --> 33:58.943
Solanterum fobex.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.369
Tingles on the palate.

34:00.456 --> 34:02.196
Mildly radioactive in quantity.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.998
So what? We're out
of coolant rods.

34:05.085 --> 34:08.327
Don't you people know
your own ship?!

34:08.422 --> 34:11.334
We have solanterum!

34:14.261 --> 34:18.971
Solanterum is a toxic absorbing
regulator within Moya's
filter system.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.844
Pipes of it run all the
way through this...

34:20.935 --> 34:23.176
Okay, okay. We got it already.

34:25.064 --> 34:27.225
Too far away to tell.

34:27.316 --> 34:29.728
But it's coming.

34:29.818 --> 34:32.309
All right, 1812.

34:32.404 --> 34:36.488
Even spacing, all tiers, no
gaps. Cannons set to minimum.

34:36.575 --> 34:40.318
Tell all your cousins.
Go do it.

34:40.412 --> 34:41.993
You sure you wanna be here?

34:42.081 --> 34:43.867
Yup. My skin reflects radiation.

34:43.958 --> 34:46.290
We don't tan, but we
don't burn either.

34:46.377 --> 34:47.412
Aeryn?

34:47.503 --> 34:49.744
I believe I've set a simple
control sequence

34:49.838 --> 34:52.170
to fire all DRDs simultaneously.

34:52.258 --> 34:53.998
All right, come on back.
-|'|| stay and activate.

34:54.093 --> 34:56.209
Unless you'll agree
to trust Scorpius.

34:57.471 --> 34:59.462
Aeryn, one word.

34:59.556 --> 35:00.887
Radiation.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.761
I can handle it.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.637
And what about the baby?

35:04.728 --> 35:06.104
(sighing softly)

35:09.275 --> 35:11.140
Volunteers?

35:11.235 --> 35:14.773
Even minimal ion exposure
breaks down three of my
internal organs.

35:14.863 --> 35:17.855
I doubt I shall survive
until I am needed.

35:30.379 --> 35:31.209
Okay.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.332
Hey, Fluffy.

35:32.423 --> 35:33.663
Captain going down
with the ship?

35:33.757 --> 35:35.133
( sarcastic chuckle ):
You wish.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.629
Just don't frell it up.

35:37.720 --> 35:40.462
So, won't need SPF.
You sure this is going to work?

35:40.556 --> 35:43.719
Nope. But Aeryn said it would.

35:43.809 --> 35:47.301
Something about you wanting
to have more babies?

35:51.066 --> 35:54.024
Fortunate this fungus causes
you so much mucus.

35:54.111 --> 35:57.444
Excellent. Just hold it steady.
Here we go.

36:00.367 --> 36:02.358
(strong wind blowing )

36:04.330 --> 36:05.570
(grunting)

36:09.335 --> 36:10.996
It's like a wind tunnel in here.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.201
Yeah.

36:12.296 --> 36:14.002
Can't be helped.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.798
Filter's gotta be off and
we gotta stop this fan
from spinning.

36:17.885 --> 36:19.295
All right. Okay.

36:19.386 --> 36:20.671
(grunting)

36:22.473 --> 36:26.136
That'll keep the stuff from
getting sucked back in here
and being cleansed.

36:26.226 --> 36:28.137
We've gotta keep the mist out
of the ship, or we're toast.

36:28.228 --> 36:30.059
You get to it!

36:33.525 --> 36:35.106
That one first.

36:35.194 --> 36:36.684
Officer Sun was quite
clear in her...

36:36.779 --> 36:42.820
If this goes bad, please die
first so my last moment
can be joyous.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.111
Whoo-hoo!

36:47.206 --> 36:49.288
(grunting)

36:50.709 --> 36:51.994
Ryg...

36:52.086 --> 36:53.792
be ready for my signal.

36:53.879 --> 36:58.248
If we ignite the purple haze
too soon, the radiation won't
penetrate Moya.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.424
Too late, we'll blast her apart.

37:00.511 --> 37:02.923
Rygel:
Acknowledged.

37:03.013 --> 37:06.551
lt'll make me stronger.

37:06.642 --> 37:09.224
Radioactive mist makes
you stronger?

37:09.311 --> 37:14.476
Perhaps my final moments
will be joyous.

37:15.192 --> 37:16.352
(QUIPS)

37:21.240 --> 37:22.446
Aeryn:
It's working.

37:22.533 --> 37:25.320
We're pushing Moya clear.

37:32.751 --> 37:37.040
D'Argo, wormhole in four...

37:37.131 --> 37:38.917
three...

37:39.007 --> 37:40.668
dos...

37:40.759 --> 37:42.295
uno...

37:49.184 --> 37:51.300
We're fine. Thanks for
the big warning.

37:51.395 --> 37:52.475
Now, get it done.

37:52.563 --> 37:54.679
As a single element?

37:54.773 --> 37:58.391
Solanterum needs to be heated
to achieve effectiveness.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.476
1812, poll the brothers.

38:00.571 --> 38:04.189
Everybody seeing the mist?

38:08.954 --> 38:10.569
That's an affirmative.

38:10.664 --> 38:12.905
The mist should be through
the ship

38:13.000 --> 38:14.865
on every tier.
-Just go!

38:15.502 --> 38:17.993
All DRDs stand by.

38:19.423 --> 38:22.005
Rygel, batter up.

38:22.092 --> 38:23.593
Ah! Wormhole!

38:23.677 --> 38:25.292
Too close to wormhole!

38:25.387 --> 38:26.627
Rygel:
Pilot, calm down.

38:26.722 --> 38:28.929
Crichton:
Fire the DRDs!

38:30.976 --> 38:33.012
Rygel!

38:33.103 --> 38:34.183
No, get away!

38:34.271 --> 38:36.057
I'm trying to help!

38:36.148 --> 38:39.982
Sikozu:
Too much chemical and the
explosion will destroy us all.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.319
Crichton, do you copy?

38:41.403 --> 38:43.689
Damn it, Aeryn, what do you
want me to do?!

38:43.780 --> 38:45.236
Rygel!

38:45.324 --> 38:46.939
Let me go!

38:47.034 --> 38:48.945
(growling)

38:49.036 --> 38:50.992
(yelling)

38:51.079 --> 38:51.864
Rygel!

38:51.955 --> 38:53.286
(groaning)

39:08.263 --> 39:10.003
(groaning)

39:12.100 --> 39:14.307
Crichton?!

39:14.394 --> 39:15.429
(yelling)

39:15.521 --> 39:16.385
Gotcha!

39:16.480 --> 39:18.641
(yelling)
-I gotcha.

39:18.732 --> 39:21.269
l'm slipping!

39:21.944 --> 39:23.275
Rygel!
-Pull me back!

39:23.362 --> 39:24.647
Shut off the fans!

39:24.738 --> 39:26.069
What fans?!

39:26.156 --> 39:27.316
Shut down the fans!

39:27.407 --> 39:29.272
Shut off the fans!

39:29.368 --> 39:31.279
Nobody told me about any fans!

39:31.370 --> 39:33.201
Chiana:
Crichton!

39:33.288 --> 39:34.698
(yelling)

39:36.333 --> 39:38.995
Pull me back! Pull me back!

39:39.086 --> 39:40.121
I'm trying!

39:40.212 --> 39:42.294
Please, I'm slipping!

39:42.381 --> 39:43.587
Oh, fan. Fan.

39:43.674 --> 39:46.757
Pip, just hang on!

39:46.843 --> 39:49.300
Rygel, shut the fans off!

39:49.388 --> 39:51.128
Rygel:
I don't know how!

39:51.223 --> 39:53.635
Pilot, fan! Fan, fan, fan!

39:53.725 --> 39:56.262
Shut the damn fans off!

39:56.353 --> 39:57.968
Quit wiggling.

39:59.189 --> 40:00.144
Just hang on.

40:00.232 --> 40:01.221
(grunting)

40:01.316 --> 40:02.146
Frelling fan.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.850
You bastard!

40:04.945 --> 40:06.651
(yelling)

40:06.738 --> 40:08.069
(grunting)

40:11.034 --> 40:12.820
Rygel:
How about that?

40:12.911 --> 40:14.822
Did that do anything?

40:14.913 --> 40:16.528
Yeah. The fan's off.

40:16.623 --> 40:18.124
It is?

40:18.208 --> 40:19.448
Yeah.

40:19.543 --> 40:20.874
We did it.

40:20.961 --> 40:22.417
(gasping)

40:22.504 --> 40:24.836
I did it.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.383
(panting)

40:30.470 --> 40:33.382
Hey, you still got
your pants on.

40:33.473 --> 40:34.883
Well, that'd be a first.

40:34.975 --> 40:38.092
(laughing)

40:39.438 --> 40:41.144
That's a good look.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.222
(laughing)

40:43.317 --> 40:45.023
Very funny.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.351
Very, very funny.

40:49.072 --> 40:52.530
Pilot:
The voting for the captaincy
is complete.

40:52.618 --> 40:57.829
With Moya abstaining and
everyone except for Scorpius
casting a vote,

40:57.914 --> 41:01.372
including myself, our total
comes to eight.

41:01.460 --> 41:03.416
The tally is as follows.

41:03.503 --> 41:06.916
One vote for Dominar Rygel
the Sixteenth.

41:07.966 --> 41:12.084
One vote for Officer Aeryn Sun.

41:12.179 --> 41:17.048
Astonishing as it seems,
Scorpius received one vote.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.224
( growls softly )

41:19.311 --> 41:24.647
One vote was cast for the
Divine Eternal.

41:24.733 --> 41:30.103
And finally, four votes for our
new and deserving Captain...

41:30.656 --> 41:32.237
Ka D'Argo.

41:36.703 --> 41:38.659
(chuckling)

41:39.748 --> 41:41.284
(sighing)

41:43.126 --> 41:44.957
Chiana:
Well done.

42:12.322 --> 42:15.906
I didn't want to tell you about
the pregnancy until I was sure.

42:19.246 --> 42:23.330
Sure you were pregnant,
or sure who the father was?

42:26.211 --> 42:27.826
Chiana will be killed.

42:27.921 --> 42:30.378
Yeah, it's Chiana's fault.
Why don't you blame her?

42:37.264 --> 42:39.129
It's the other Crichton's?

42:39.224 --> 42:42.307
There's no distinction
in my mind anymore.

42:45.147 --> 42:47.388
Okay, now you've confused me.

42:47.482 --> 42:49.393
All right.

42:50.944 --> 42:55.654
Military campaigns can
last for many cycles.

42:55.741 --> 43:00.952
Imagine if even a portion of
a female unit fell pregnant.

43:01.037 --> 43:03.449
Those of us born on a
Command Carrier

43:03.540 --> 43:07.328
can retain an embryonic fetus
for up to seven cycles.

43:08.211 --> 43:11.294
So, this could be from...

43:11.381 --> 43:16.671
Perhaps four cycles
before I met you.

43:16.762 --> 43:21.005
And only a surgeon can release
the stasis so the baby can grow.

43:21.099 --> 43:23.431
And that's why you left?

43:23.518 --> 43:25.634
I didn't even make it that far.

43:31.693 --> 43:33.274
Aeryn...

43:35.071 --> 43:38.438
I figure a relationship,

43:38.533 --> 43:44.199
the kind we're not having,
is based on trust.

43:46.249 --> 43:48.240
I'm so sorry.

43:49.586 --> 43:52.669
Yeah. Me, too.

43:57.469 --> 44:00.757
'Cause you don't trust me.

44:01.973 --> 44:04.385
So I don't know how
to trust you.

44:04.476 --> 44:06.888
I think I've earned your trust.

44:06.978 --> 44:11.267
I would put my life
in your hands.

44:13.109 --> 44:15.976
But not my heart.

44:29.876 --> 44:31.867
So what's it going to take?

44:31.962 --> 44:34.374
What do l have to do?

44:35.382 --> 44:38.124
Just come back.

44:38.218 --> 44:41.130
When you have your
story straight.
