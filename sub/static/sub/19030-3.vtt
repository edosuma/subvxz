00:05.371 --> 00:07.776

00:25.693 --> 00:27.655
Thanks for letting
me observe, fellas.

00:27.689 --> 00:30.259
Come on,
you got five more surgeries today!

00:30.971 --> 00:32.873
Tumour's down by his bean bags!

00:33.345 --> 00:35.360
We should probably take that out.

00:35.838 --> 00:38.339
It's like, all of a sudden,
this hospital is a police state.

00:38.356 --> 00:39.158
I mean,
next thing you know,

00:39.218 --> 00:41.126
they're gonna be charging doctors
for candy at the gift shop.

00:41.274 --> 00:43.875
They do charge doctors for
candy at the gift shop, Elliot.

00:43.892 --> 00:44.760
Really?

00:44.917 --> 00:47.035
Then, why does Johann always let me--

00:47.036 --> 00:50.265
Because he wants to make you his
wife and bring you back to Estonia.

00:51.568 --> 00:53.901
That's why he's always asking me
if I'm comfortable around oxen.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.384
Elliot, I'm trying to
talk to you about Maddox

00:55.434 --> 00:57.032
and how we can't work the system anymore.

00:57.417 --> 00:58.459
Correction:

00:58.615 --> 01:00.681
You can't work the system anymore.

01:00.716 --> 01:02.522
I, can.

01:02.731 --> 01:05.596
For instance, I just got Mr. Tillman
back there into a clinical trial

01:05.597 --> 01:08.965
that has a cut-off age of 30.
He's actually 35.

01:08.973 --> 01:11.873
But if anyone asks Mr. Tillman,
you're how old?

01:11.958 --> 01:13.109
35!

01:13.503 --> 01:15.014
I forgot to mention

01:15.049 --> 01:17.280
that it is a clinical
trial for head injuries.

01:17.575 --> 01:19.034
- Ah, he hurt his head.
- Ah!

01:19.225 --> 01:20.649
The point is,

01:20.753 --> 01:24.053
that I'm still able to give
top-notch care to my patients,

01:24.132 --> 01:25.954
whereas you, are not.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.673
35!

01:28.326 --> 01:29.854
You know why?

01:30.045 --> 01:32.876
I am a much, much
better doctor than you.

01:35.183 --> 01:37.968
Ooh, look at that big lollipop!

01:38.055 --> 01:39.811
I wouldn't know whether I'll lick it

01:39.891 --> 01:43.053
or that it'd just lift up my
skirt and spank myself with it.

01:43.551 --> 01:44.436
Elliot!

01:44.507 --> 01:45.584
It's free candy!

01:46.759 --> 01:50.614
Dr. Reid, I thought you gave a great
endocrynology lecture today,

01:50.718 --> 01:54.582
even though some of the other interns think
you go of on personal tangents too much.

01:54.652 --> 01:55.503
Who?

01:55.520 --> 01:57.234
Oh, I shouldn't say.

01:57.410 --> 01:58.088
Denise.

01:58.122 --> 01:58.817
Anyway, I was hoping

01:58.834 --> 02:01.348
you could have signed me some
more interesting procedures?

02:01.383 --> 02:02.351
Rain it in...

02:02.420 --> 02:03.080
Katie.

02:03.184 --> 02:05.303
Just go place a
central line on Mr. Clark.

02:05.373 --> 02:06.349
Thanks!

02:06.384 --> 02:07.461
Wow!

02:07.365 --> 02:09.332
The butt-kissing isn't even the worst part.

02:09.401 --> 02:11.780
I feel like Katie will do
anything to get ahead, you know.

02:11.815 --> 02:13.778
I'm this close to
freezing her olive (sp?).

02:14.229 --> 02:16.126
Just like I did Dr. Simmons.

02:16.143 --> 02:18.047
Yeah,
what would you do with her?

02:18.091 --> 02:21.391
Hello, she wears the exact
same thing as me everyday.

02:21.478 --> 02:22.120
Yeah,

02:22.155 --> 02:23.996
we're talking about you, skank!

02:24.187 --> 02:25.775
Nice dress!

02:26.192 --> 02:29.752
Veronica, I have no idea how are
you doing this! But I will find out.

02:31.780 --> 02:32.787
35!

02:33.187 --> 02:34.402
Hi, Mr. Tillman.

02:34.663 --> 02:36.243
You ready to go to work?

02:37.300 --> 02:38.690
Hello, Mr. Rosell!

02:38.742 --> 02:40.079
You can call me Pat.

02:40.096 --> 02:41.902
This is my daughter Christine.

02:41.944 --> 02:44.080
So Pat, I understand that you
have multiple sclerosis

02:44.115 --> 02:46.373
and that you are interested
being put on Interferon.

02:46.390 --> 02:48.318
I held off
as long as I could but,

02:48.352 --> 02:51.687
now the hand spasms and
the nausea are pretty bad.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.146
Plus, I'm colour-blind.

02:53.284 --> 02:55.542
Well, we're gonna go run
a whole bunch of tests.

02:55.785 --> 02:57.299
<i>And get some coffee.</i>

02:58.259 --> 02:58.990
Oh!

02:59.771 --> 03:01.247
Dammit!

03:01.351 --> 03:02.654
Now I have to go change.

03:03.592 --> 03:04.651
So,

03:04.721 --> 03:05.849
how you holding up?

03:05.868 --> 03:08.959
Cleaning's an art,
my mop was my paintbrush.

03:09.307 --> 03:12.450

seen the janitor since he was fired.</i>

03:12.519 --> 03:14.169

03:19.907 --> 03:21.123
<i>Oh my God!</i>

03:21.453 --> 03:22.572
<i>What if something
really happened to him?</i>

03:22.682 --> 03:23.476
<i>I'd be lost!</i>

03:23.753 --> 03:25.716
<i>Stop thinking like that,
Turk's fine!</i>

03:25.837 --> 03:27.886
<i>Turk's fine, Turk's fine,
Turk's fine, Turk's fine!</i>

03:27.956 --> 03:29.171
JD!

03:29.675 --> 03:31.134
The janitor got fired.

03:31.168 --> 03:32.673
No, it's okay.

03:32.778 --> 03:34.896
He knows,
he just doesn't care.

03:35.053 --> 03:37.441
See, in his mind, I'm the
bad guy in our relationship,

03:37.475 --> 03:39.526
even though if he stopped to think
about it for a minute, he would realise

03:39.607 --> 03:41.634
I never did a thing to
him that he didn't deserve.

03:41.817 --> 03:43.910
You locked me in a water tower!

03:43.944 --> 03:45.177
You were on the wall.

03:45.229 --> 03:47.140
You destroyed my scooter, Sasha!

03:47.174 --> 03:48.675
You know I hate Wednesdays.

03:48.721 --> 03:50.753
You haunted my pediatric patients.

03:50.805 --> 03:53.462
You didn't wear the shorts that
my imaginary wife made for you.

03:53.514 --> 03:56.152
Janitor, I just heard.
I'm so sorry!

03:56.725 --> 03:57.750

03:58.670 --> 04:00.052

04:20.790 --> 04:21.281
Hey!

04:21.315 --> 04:23.667
Thanks for placing that
central line for me.

04:23.875 --> 04:26.498
I'm just so not great at
that procedure, you know.

04:26.741 --> 04:28.157
Look at you,

04:28.309 --> 04:32.598
watching over the ICU like a proud
lioness looking out over her jungle.

04:32.599 --> 04:34.282
Elliot, stop.

04:34.803 --> 04:36.394
Oh my God,
that wasn't a real 'stop',

04:36.395 --> 04:39.503
that was a 'keep going because
I'm actually loving this stop', wasn't it?

04:40.273 --> 04:41.211
Maybe...

04:42.149 --> 04:44.549
I never got one of these before!
This is so exciting!

04:44.584 --> 04:46.321
I'll leave before I ruin it.

04:49.401 --> 04:51.312
Great job on
Mr. Clark's central line.

04:51.364 --> 04:53.170
Thanks, it was super easy.

04:56.923 --> 04:59.771
Okay Mr. Rosell,
let's get you on in some Interferon.

04:59.858 --> 05:03.748
So it can start interferring
with that pesky MS of yours.

05:03.902 --> 05:06.142
Are you making fun
of my multiple sclerosis?

05:06.194 --> 05:06.941
Sorry, I mean...

05:06.975 --> 05:10.258
I'm just trying to lighten the moment.
It won't happen again, I promise.

05:10.431 --> 05:14.286
<i>Interferon, sounds like the name of
a robot that always gets in the way.</i>

05:14.380 --> 05:16.603
So we brought you some pills
for your pain and your nausea.

05:16.655 --> 05:17.940
Dr. Dorian?

05:19.407 --> 05:21.439
- JD. Pills.
- Right, pills.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.618
Take the red one now
for the pain.

05:26.447 --> 05:28.375
Mr. Rosell took the red pill.

05:28.531 --> 05:29.816
Yeah, we told him to.

05:29.851 --> 05:33.151
If he can't see colours,
how did he know which one is red?

05:33.785 --> 05:36.858
He's just another addict
scamming us for meds.

05:37.431 --> 05:39.081
Frick on a stick!

05:42.417 --> 05:44.240
Looking for something?

05:44.397 --> 05:46.324
Yes, my 'Cloak of Invisibility',

05:46.393 --> 05:50.231
so that I can avoid conversations with
soul-less dictators such as yourself.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.254
Unfortunately,
it's really hard to find,

05:52.306 --> 05:54.407
because as the name suggests,

05:54.494 --> 05:55.901
it's invisible.

05:56.109 --> 05:58.013
Alright, Dr. Cox.

05:58.117 --> 05:59.402
Ridiculous name,
by the way.

05:59.958 --> 06:02.030
If you're looking for your patient
Mr. Tillman,

06:02.100 --> 06:05.868
my guess is he's probably in a
bus somewhere, screaming, "35!".

06:06.094 --> 06:07.787
See, I've anounced him
from his head trauma trial

06:07.788 --> 06:11.434
because I learned that
somebody was lying about his age.

06:12.381 --> 06:13.214
See ya!

06:15.759 --> 06:19.423
I gotta get rid of this Maddox.
Honest to God, she is...

06:19.597 --> 06:21.333
Why aren't you listening to me?

06:21.439 --> 06:22.985
Because of that.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.076
That scone looks good.

06:26.117 --> 06:27.194
Oh yeah?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.292
We should have sex later.

06:34.362 --> 06:37.296
How did you get from
that image to that thought?

06:37.887 --> 06:39.491
I'll tell you tonight.

06:39.514 --> 06:42.518
Just bring home a scone
and a Hawaiian shirt.

06:42.872 --> 06:45.169
Mama's heating up!

06:45.870 --> 06:46.894
Donnie,

06:46.947 --> 06:49.482
do my free muffins per
wife include scones?

06:49.517 --> 06:50.489
Nope.

06:50.559 --> 06:51.742
Damn you, God!

06:54.000 --> 06:56.320
I am getting rid of Maddox.
Who's in?

06:56.355 --> 06:57.497
I'm in.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.852
Ever since you fired me,
I've been moping around my apartment,

06:59.952 --> 07:01.014
making parking sounds.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.419
I-I'm not crazy,

07:03.462 --> 07:04.981
I just need some human interaction

07:05.016 --> 07:08.107
and the barking makes the neighbours yell,
"Shut the damn thing up!"

07:08.298 --> 07:11.154
Then I can go over there with a bottle
of scotch and apologize for Rusty,

07:11.172 --> 07:12.717
my imaginary akita.

07:13.212 --> 07:15.487
The only downside is that about
the time Lady, my girlfriend,

07:15.522 --> 07:17.727
gets home,
I'm too drunk to talk to her.

07:17.814 --> 07:19.290
Much less make love.

07:20.384 --> 07:23.093
You've never pictured me as an
organism that has sex, have you?

07:23.117 --> 07:24.854
- We have not.
- No.

07:24.923 --> 07:25.757
I understand.

07:25.774 --> 07:28.448
Is Dr. Maddox really that bad?

07:28.483 --> 07:31.183
Hmm, she's like you.
Only smarter on the ball.

07:31.340 --> 07:32.712
That must suck!

07:34.651 --> 07:35.398
Admit it.

07:35.797 --> 07:39.618
You miss having me as the
Chief of Medicine.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.242
Bob!

07:41.276 --> 07:43.895
I will gladly admit to
anything that's true,

07:44.046 --> 07:45.202
no matter how embarrasing.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.494
For example,

07:46.546 --> 07:49.575
I've always wished that I
could carry a child inside of me,

07:49.575 --> 07:51.190
and you know, birth it.

07:51.382 --> 07:54.369
But I'll never admit
to missing you, Bob.

07:54.690 --> 07:55.506
Ever.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.808
Rusty, heel!

07:59.613 --> 08:00.831
Donnie,

08:00.970 --> 08:05.138
I'm gonna need a Double Chocolate
Blaster as a 'pick-me-up'.

08:06.901 --> 08:08.290
Maybe another.

08:10.921 --> 08:12.588
Hello, girls.

08:13.628 --> 08:15.363
Oh, sit down, Katie,
sit down!

08:15.364 --> 08:17.295
It's time to set you straight!

08:17.296 --> 08:20.418
But we'd better do it fast because,
man, you're annoying.

08:20.423 --> 08:23.027
Why do you think you
can talk to me like this?

08:23.045 --> 08:24.573
You're just a nurse.

08:25.042 --> 08:25.858
Okay.

08:25.893 --> 08:26.622
A:

08:26.665 --> 08:28.193
I'm a lioness.

08:28.367 --> 08:29.096
B:

08:29.287 --> 08:32.066
Who the hell do you think
runs this place?

08:32.265 --> 08:34.765
The nursing staff is
already turned on you.

08:34.878 --> 08:38.698
Why do you think you were assigned
75 baldous impactions (sp?) this week?

08:38.828 --> 08:40.835
I don't care, I'm good at it.

08:41.059 --> 08:42.988
Plus, this morning,
I found a silver dollar.

08:43.596 --> 08:45.940
Everyone's onto you,
missy.

08:46.392 --> 08:48.302
Pretty soon,
you're gonna get called out.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.399
You're lying to us.

08:50.469 --> 08:52.518
You took the red pill,
you can see colours.

08:52.665 --> 08:55.496
You know, I'm
sick and tired of low-lifes like you

08:55.530 --> 08:58.907
trying to come here and
squirt pain medication off of us, okay?

08:58.959 --> 09:00.418
You make us care

09:00.435 --> 09:02.867
and then because you're word,
we're gonna see through your little plan.

09:02.901 --> 09:04.551
You don't even laugh
at our jokes.

09:04.690 --> 09:07.538
Actually, the Interferon joke
was sort of funny.

09:07.573 --> 09:09.776
You damn right it was, Pat!
Okay?

09:09.811 --> 09:11.548
But this time,
no one's getting off easy.

09:11.565 --> 09:13.076
My cousin is a cop.

09:13.249 --> 09:14.569
And not a good cop either,

09:14.604 --> 09:15.767
a rogue cop!

09:16.375 --> 09:18.265
- Christine, it's you, isn't it?
- Hold on, hold on Elliot.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.107
You ever watched The Shield, Pat?

09:20.125 --> 09:22.035
Do you happen to get FX, Pat?

09:22.044 --> 09:23.902
Because you're gonna get
Michael Chicklest!

09:23.919 --> 09:24.666
In the head!

09:24.770 --> 09:27.096
He's the orange guy
in Fantastic Four;

09:27.097 --> 09:28.399
that's coming down on ya!

09:28.434 --> 09:29.250
JD!

09:29.667 --> 09:32.037
Look at her hand,
it's in spasm.

09:32.124 --> 09:34.590
You're the one who
wants the MS, right?

09:35.693 --> 09:38.583
I don't have any insurance and
my dad just thought that since he did--

09:38.584 --> 09:40.563
Look, we'll go, alright?

09:40.589 --> 09:43.176
If you, uh,
could just not tell anyone,

09:43.298 --> 09:44.922
we'd be very grateful.

09:45.529 --> 09:47.946
<i>Elliot and I knew
what we had to do.</i>

09:48.137 --> 09:49.509
Okay, Pat.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.776
You have MS.

09:51.809 --> 09:54.839
And you're not leaving here
until you get your medication.

09:56.437 --> 09:57.479
Thank you.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.070
Do you know how grateful
people would be

10:00.139 --> 10:03.525
if you showed them even
a little common decency.

10:03.682 --> 10:06.373
Oh please!
This place is so competitive.

10:06.790 --> 10:08.874
No one looks out
for each other here.

10:09.386 --> 10:12.076
Ah, yeah.
This Maddox is a damn sketchy.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.643
I guarantee you will find
something in these files.

10:15.188 --> 10:17.228
Hurry up, man,
I don't wanna get busted!

10:17.541 --> 10:20.215
Now listen there, great babe,
I only invited you to help me

10:20.224 --> 10:22.082
because it had never dawned
on me that you'd get all

10:22.099 --> 10:24.374
panicky over a little
breaking-and-entering.

10:24.426 --> 10:25.520
Actually, I'm not.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.430
See, this stuff has
become so mundane to me

10:27.448 --> 10:28.924
that I've created a character

10:28.959 --> 10:30.487
who's terrified about
going back to prison.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.477
And through him,

10:31.512 --> 10:34.412
I hope to feel once again,
the old rush.

10:34.724 --> 10:35.957
You carry on.

10:36.054 --> 10:36.870
Good.

10:36.905 --> 10:39.058
'Cause I can't go back there, man!

10:39.076 --> 10:41.038
Not after what they did to Johnny!

10:41.281 --> 10:44.016
Oh Johnny, he was the best.
I wish you knew him.

10:46.099 --> 10:48.009
They shaked him with a shiv,

10:48.547 --> 10:50.388
then they shift him with a shick.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.140
Out for a pack of smokes.

10:53.305 --> 10:54.520
Johnny,

10:54.642 --> 10:57.316
you were too beautiful
for this world, man.

10:57.828 --> 10:59.790
I'll be king in the next!

11:01.944 --> 11:03.489
Johnny!

11:03.819 --> 11:05.295
Johnny.

11:07.969 --> 11:09.515
Hey, guys?

11:09.550 --> 11:10.192
Listen!

11:10.229 --> 11:13.058
I popped in here earlier
and not Mr. Rosell

11:13.075 --> 11:15.046
but his daughter showing signs of MS.

11:15.098 --> 11:18.606
They were lying to get her the drugs.
Can you believe it?

11:18.649 --> 11:19.604
I'm angry!

11:19.605 --> 11:21.758
I wanna shake these things!

11:21.775 --> 11:22.506
Hard!

11:22.524 --> 11:25.823
Anyway, I played the bad guy for you
and I tossed them out.

11:25.962 --> 11:27.872
I love playing the bad guy!

11:27.916 --> 11:30.208
I'd even wear black scrubs
if they made them.

11:31.632 --> 11:34.324
Do you even know what people
are calling you around here?

11:34.636 --> 11:36.147
I know, I don't care.

11:36.165 --> 11:38.961
Because I wrote the worst one
on this piece of paper.

11:41.670 --> 11:44.691
Sausages, sausages
and more sausages?

11:44.726 --> 11:46.254
It's actually...

11:46.280 --> 11:48.052
Turk's grocery list.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.101
But you do care,
don't you?

11:50.465 --> 11:52.566
Katie, if you keep
going down this road,

11:52.583 --> 11:55.240
eventually,
people will come after you.

11:55.570 --> 11:56.612
Hey, you!

11:56.690 --> 11:58.895
How do you think the board will feel
if I can show 'em proof that

11:58.896 --> 12:01.935
you're in the take
for a medical supply company?

12:02.043 --> 12:03.484
I'm guessing they'd be thrilled

12:03.519 --> 12:06.523
since I'm rolling that money
back into the hospital's budget.

12:06.714 --> 12:09.250
Please,
stop handcuffing us!

12:09.328 --> 12:13.201
You're making it impossible
for us to help our patients.

12:14.677 --> 12:17.471
Does anybody else
feel that way?

12:20.540 --> 12:21.842
Great!

12:21.912 --> 12:24.794
Now I don't have to tell you
each individually that, um...

12:24.820 --> 12:27.599
I don't give a rat's hairy ass!

12:28.562 --> 12:30.646
It's a huge time-saver!

12:31.054 --> 12:32.287
Thanks, gang!

12:32.395 --> 12:34.166
And eventually, Katie,

12:34.218 --> 12:36.511
everyone here is
gonna hate you.

12:39.368 --> 12:40.976
Look, Carla,

12:41.063 --> 12:43.199
I appreciate this whole
mother-hen thing...

12:43.234 --> 12:43.946
Lioness.

12:43.980 --> 12:47.923
Lioness thing that you've got going
on here, but I don't need your help.

12:47.981 --> 12:50.274
Look, I know you think
you're fine on your own,

12:50.343 --> 12:54.520
but in order to survive here,
you need to surround yourself with friends.

12:55.267 --> 12:56.673
Look over there.

12:57.090 --> 12:59.678
I can count on three
out of four of those people.

12:59.730 --> 13:01.753
I trust them
with all my secrets.

13:01.776 --> 13:02.727
Oh, you guys...

13:02.796 --> 13:05.592
Carla had the nastiest sex
dream about the cafeteria lady.

13:05.644 --> 13:07.242
Watch how uncomfortable she gets.

13:10.161 --> 13:11.915
Nice ear-rings!

13:11.967 --> 13:13.556
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

13:14.250 --> 13:16.595
How are we gonna get
rid of Maddox, Janitor?

13:16.734 --> 13:19.668
Would you like to get your
useless ideas out of the way first?

13:19.738 --> 13:21.283
Well, thank you, Perry.

13:21.604 --> 13:24.365
Of the top of my head,
I go reindeer stampede.

13:24.452 --> 13:25.737
Astronaut attack,

13:25.815 --> 13:27.499
barbed-wire chandelier,

13:27.656 --> 13:28.611
Photoshop,

13:28.663 --> 13:29.992
poisonous sushi--

13:30.356 --> 13:32.318
When you said "Photoshop",

13:32.423 --> 13:36.208
did you mean use Photoshop to
create an incriminating picture?

13:36.321 --> 13:39.481
No. I meant we build
an actual photo shop.

13:39.559 --> 13:41.088
Or a chain of photo shops.

13:41.122 --> 13:42.182
We each manage one.

13:42.286 --> 13:46.002
We let time pass. Eventually,
Maddox has to have her film developed.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.043
She comes in,
we all hop out,

13:48.077 --> 13:49.154
yell, "Surprise!"

13:49.171 --> 13:51.585
and beat her to death
with pool cues.

13:51.828 --> 13:53.547
I'm gonna go ahead
and apologize

13:53.581 --> 13:56.776
because it's my fault
that we're back-tracking.

13:56.846 --> 13:58.322
It's okay. I'm not mad.

13:58.374 --> 14:00.773
You guys, let's face it:
Maddox is intouchable.

14:00.902 --> 14:03.854
<i>Not true. I know how
to get rid of any woman.</i>

14:05.188 --> 14:06.438
Dr. Maddox?

14:07.124 --> 14:08.253
I love you.

14:08.530 --> 14:10.406
Excuse me for just a second.

14:10.493 --> 14:12.881
Where you going,
I'm telling you that I love you, I...?

14:13.228 --> 14:14.183
Okay.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.526
<i>Too mean, psychée.</i>

14:19.602 --> 14:22.953
Admittedly, getting rid of Maddox
is a board issue

14:23.005 --> 14:25.888
but as you all know,
I recently retired

14:25.905 --> 14:27.451
to become a full-time mom.

14:27.461 --> 14:30.275
<i>Crap, we forgot Jordan's
retirement party last week!</i>

14:30.327 --> 14:31.907
<i>I hope we
weren't the only ones.</i>

14:31.942 --> 14:34.186
I really should have
gone to your party.

14:34.255 --> 14:35.297
You think?

14:35.367 --> 14:36.509
Afternoon!

14:36.578 --> 14:38.992
Power walk, coming through!

14:40.076 --> 14:42.507
Why don't you guys just
get him to help you?

14:42.559 --> 14:44.417
He has so much dirt on
all the board members,

14:44.435 --> 14:45.789
they'll do whatever he want.

14:45.859 --> 14:47.832
She's right Perry,
let's roll!

14:51.409 --> 14:53.623
Big cat? I need ya.

14:55.828 --> 14:58.138
If you come with me to Dr. Kelso,
I won't talk to you.

14:58.172 --> 14:59.301
There it is.

15:01.559 --> 15:02.965
Hey, Johann.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.719
Give me some chocolate.

15:06.057 --> 15:07.560
Johann, you slut!

15:09.140 --> 15:10.373
These puppies,

15:10.477 --> 15:11.970
they pay for themselves.

15:12.853 --> 15:14.264
Katie,
what you don't realise--

15:14.265 --> 15:15.217
What are we doing here?

15:15.234 --> 15:16.738
Are you setting us straight?

15:16.796 --> 15:18.022
I'm trying to!

15:19.116 --> 15:20.554
Look Katie,
we don't realise--

15:20.555 --> 15:21.243
May I cut in?

15:21.456 --> 15:22.230
Go ahead.

15:24.231 --> 15:25.738
My rules for getting by here

15:25.941 --> 15:28.212
are the same as my rules
for getting by in Mexico.

15:28.854 --> 15:30.600
One:
Don't drink the water.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.538
Two:
Party till you drop.

15:32.658 --> 15:33.359
Three:

15:33.837 --> 15:35.964
Everything is negotiable.

15:36.114 --> 15:40.218
So you want me to go coerce the
board and get firing Dr. Maddox.

15:40.674 --> 15:41.532
I'll tell you what.

15:42.444 --> 15:44.594
I'll think about it over a muffin.
Donnie!

15:46.190 --> 15:46.744
Dude!

15:46.864 --> 15:48.448
We need an answer now,
Bob.

15:49.427 --> 15:50.585
Fine, I'll do it.

15:51.429 --> 15:54.412
If you tell me you
miss having me as chief.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.479
- Oh, so much, sir!
- Oh, so much.

15:55.506 --> 15:56.597
I missed your smell!

15:56.643 --> 15:57.706
Not you two.

15:58.955 --> 15:59.497
Him!

16:00.841 --> 16:02.791
You know,
you hurt my feelings earlier.

16:03.334 --> 16:04.253
In my defense,

16:04.254 --> 16:06.621
you are a soul-less creature
from another world

16:06.622 --> 16:08.295
who doesn't really have feelings.

16:10.063 --> 16:12.420
Thank you, Donnie,
but I'll fight my own battles.

16:14.172 --> 16:15.523
You want Maddox gone?

16:16.245 --> 16:17.343
Just tell me you miss me.

16:18.192 --> 16:18.830
Fine.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.332
But he can't do it in front of people.

16:21.456 --> 16:22.311
Everybody out!

16:22.464 --> 16:22.994
Go!

16:24.565 --> 16:26.957
Actually,
I think I'm going to need

16:26.958 --> 16:30.033
Dr. Reid and Dr. Dorian
here to bear witness.

16:30.686 --> 16:32.709
Barbie! Newbie!
Back in!

16:33.734 --> 16:36.820
Calm down, there's like 23
people back in that supply closet.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.617
<i>And then we saw something amazing.</i>

16:40.349 --> 16:43.335
<i>Dr. Cox said something
nice to Dr. Kelso.</i>

16:44.344 --> 16:45.834
When you were the chief,

16:45.835 --> 16:49.204
you were a jackass and a nightmare
and I hated you in great deal.

16:50.025 --> 16:51.053
That's a good start.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.327
But I always sensed...

16:55.927 --> 16:56.748
Well, I always sensed

16:56.749 --> 16:58.548
that you were burdened,
by the job

16:58.549 --> 17:00.788
but in, what in necessarily,
who you were as a person.

17:01.057 --> 17:01.863
And...

17:01.931 --> 17:02.973
Every once in a while,

17:03.158 --> 17:05.228
you showed a shred of humanity.

17:06.141 --> 17:08.892
Plus you did manage to,
look the other way, a couple of times.

17:08.893 --> 17:09.648
That was pretty good.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.819
So for all that stuff, Bob...

17:13.663 --> 17:14.366
Yeah.

17:16.492 --> 17:17.305
I miss you.

17:18.498 --> 17:19.136
Thank you.

17:20.434 --> 17:21.132
You're welcome.

17:21.862 --> 17:22.662
Everybody back!

17:23.008 --> 17:26.647
Look, Katie, I've seen all kinds
of people come through this place.

17:27.204 --> 17:29.840
Tall, short,
gay, straight,

17:30.197 --> 17:30.908
smart,

17:31.366 --> 17:32.043
weird...

17:33.973 --> 17:37.991
The point is,
this childish, self-centered atittude

17:37.994 --> 17:39.417
you keep throwing
everyone's way

17:39.418 --> 17:40.666
is nothing new.

17:41.401 --> 17:42.916
You know what's
really driving me crazy?

17:43.406 --> 17:45.337
You keep acting
like you know me.

17:45.694 --> 17:47.108
Don't bother with the sob story.

17:47.109 --> 17:50.127
I've been here a long time,
I've heard it all before.

17:50.344 --> 17:50.915
Really?

17:51.408 --> 17:53.676
Because my dad died
when I was six,

17:53.821 --> 17:54.745
and to cope,

17:54.902 --> 17:57.289
my mom drank herself
through most of my childhood.

17:58.456 --> 18:00.841
No one ever did
anything for me.

18:01.739 --> 18:03.690
I've always had
to do it for myself.

18:04.556 --> 18:05.662
Oh, Katie.

18:06.233 --> 18:07.276
Good, huh?

18:08.311 --> 18:09.080
Heard it!

18:10.200 --> 18:10.706
Me...

18:10.990 --> 18:11.549
Did mom.

18:11.753 --> 18:12.283
JD--

18:12.446 --> 18:13.303
Did dad.

18:13.591 --> 18:14.055
Elliot--

18:14.157 --> 18:15.591
Emotionally abusive parents.

18:15.592 --> 18:16.257
Dr. Cox--

18:16.454 --> 18:19.032
Emotionally and physically
abusive dead parents,

18:19.033 --> 18:20.592
which he may have killed,
no one's sure.

18:21.316 --> 18:22.604
Look, Katie,

18:22.621 --> 18:23.943
now that you're here...

18:24.530 --> 18:26.668
It doesn't matter what
crap you have in your past;

18:26.669 --> 18:29.070
all that matters is
that you leave it there.

18:29.573 --> 18:31.723
Because this hospital
is your home now

18:31.724 --> 18:33.417
and these people
are your family.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.492
And I can tell you
they will love you

18:35.623 --> 18:37.340
unconditionally if you let them.

18:37.549 --> 18:38.880
But if you don't, they...

18:39.977 --> 18:40.575
Check that.

18:42.096 --> 18:44.500
We will eat you alive.

Hey!

18:54.973 --> 18:55.609
Frank!

18:55.863 --> 18:58.525
My favourite board member.

18:58.721 --> 18:59.854
Say hi to your wife for me.

19:02.114 --> 19:04.814
You remember that trip
we took to Thailand together?

19:05.831 --> 19:08.766
You still keep in touch with
that hermaphrodite you nailed?

19:09.849 --> 19:10.857
What was his name?

19:11.913 --> 19:12.468
Lou.

19:12.845 --> 19:14.230
[ Song: Healed
Artist: Matt Ryd ]

19:14.265 --> 19:15.531
<i>The rest was predictable:</i>

19:16.086 --> 19:17.347
<i>They fired Maddox...</i>

19:17.810 --> 19:18.537
Oh...

19:18.538 --> 19:20.388
So this is where the party is.

19:21.409 --> 19:22.727
It's okay,
go on celebrating!

19:22.728 --> 19:23.270
I don't care!

19:23.773 --> 19:25.594
I mean, sure,
I've spent the last 3 months

19:25.595 --> 19:26.566
building a life here.

19:27.282 --> 19:28.241
Buying a condo,

19:28.242 --> 19:29.781
finding a school for my kid,

19:30.880 --> 19:31.932
having sex with Mickhead.

19:32.695 --> 19:33.828
But this doesn't
have to end, baby.

19:34.325 --> 19:35.423
Oh yes, it does, Walter.

19:35.907 --> 19:38.056
You shouldn't have to strangle me
to keep your erection.

19:38.350 --> 19:39.341
I have needs.

19:40.053 --> 19:40.776
Anyway,

19:41.198 --> 19:42.724
you all think that you've won.

19:43.487 --> 19:46.297
But they're just gonna replace me
with someone exactly like me.

19:46.800 --> 19:47.968
Because nothing ever changes.

19:48.384 --> 19:49.575
People don't change.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.055
Relationships don't change.

19:51.332 --> 19:54.396
And the medical system
will never change, either.

19:55.089 --> 19:56.430
But you guys go ahead
and have fun

19:56.431 --> 19:57.517
till the moment he gets here.

19:58.974 --> 20:00.442
Should be a great cuppa' days.

20:01.147 --> 20:02.279
<i>And then, poof!</i>

20:02.760 --> 20:03.529
<i>She was gone.</i>

20:04.801 --> 20:06.847
<i>And I like to think
we proved Maddox wrong</i>

20:06.848 --> 20:07.968
<i>those next few days.</i>

20:09.518 --> 20:11.460
<i>We found a way to work
around the system.</i>

20:12.467 --> 20:13.093
Thanks.

20:13.657 --> 20:14.897
Here's the medicine,
Mr. Rosell.

20:16.531 --> 20:17.541
I hope that helps.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.478
<i>A relationship evolved...</i>

20:23.555 --> 20:24.630
Good morning, Bob.

20:25.694 --> 20:26.097
Perry.

20:27.405 --> 20:29.454
It just goes to show you
that with a little help,

20:29.455 --> 20:30.622
anything can change.

20:31.432 --> 20:32.322
Even interns.

20:32.323 --> 20:32.992
Dr. Reid?

20:35.054 --> 20:37.537
I'm not the one that placed
that central line the other day.

20:37.673 --> 20:39.061
I just took credit for it.

20:40.152 --> 20:41.406
I'm not gonna do that,
anymore.

20:42.328 --> 20:42.751
Good.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.993
Any chance to quickly show me

20:44.997 --> 20:46.196
how to place
one of those things?

20:48.209 --> 20:48.768
Let's go.
