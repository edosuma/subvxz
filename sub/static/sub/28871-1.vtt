<i>Kaslan</i>

00:37.585 --> 00:40.952
At Kaslan,
we believe that happiness

00:40.954 --> 00:42.854
is about more
than entertainment.

00:42.856 --> 00:47.092
It's about being known,
understood, loved.

00:47.094 --> 00:51.399
Introducing your new
best friend, Buddi.

00:53.601 --> 00:54.967
Hey, Buddi.
Let's watch some TV.

00:54.969 --> 00:56.735
Okay.

00:56.737 --> 01:00.272
<i>Hi, I'm Buddi. I can help you
out all over the house.</i>

01:00.274 --> 01:02.107
Buddi can connect to
and control

01:02.109 --> 01:05.077
all of your Kaslan products
and smart home devices.

01:05.078 --> 01:08.781
<i>He can be your personal DJ,
help tidy up the house.</i>

01:08.783 --> 01:11.016
<i>Control your entire
smart hub system.</i>

01:11.018 --> 01:14.720
<i>Buddi uses advanced
self-learning technology</i>

01:14.722 --> 01:16.788
<i>to constantly find new ways
to entertain you.</i>

01:16.790 --> 01:18.925
Hi, Buddi.
I'm Ben, and I'm 13 years old.

01:18.927 --> 01:20.726
<i>Hi, Buddi. I'm Ben,</i>

01:20.728 --> 01:22.228
<i>and I'm 13 years old.</i>

01:22.230 --> 01:23.930
Don't forget
your science book.

01:23.932 --> 01:25.398
<i>He adapts

01:25.400 --> 01:26.933
Thanks.

01:29.003 --> 01:31.936
<i>by connecting to a host

01:31.938 --> 01:34.740
Thanks, Buddi. I need
a Kaslan Kar pick up, please.

01:34.742 --> 01:36.741
Your car is on its way!

01:36.743 --> 01:38.776
<i>When Buddi
imprints on you,</i>

01:38.778 --> 01:40.546
<i>he becomes your best friend
for life.</i>

01:40.548 --> 01:42.915

02:23.824 --> 02:24.891
Hey!

04:29.651 --> 04:30.916
- Hello.
- Nobody told me

04:30.918 --> 04:33.252
the fucking doll was ginger.

04:33.254 --> 04:37.288
Okay, I don't think you're
allowed to say that word.

04:37.290 --> 04:40.892
My kid wanted the blonde one.
You know, that one.

04:40.894 --> 04:43.495
Yeah. So that one
is the Buddi 2,

04:43.497 --> 04:44.831
which hasn't come out yet.

04:44.833 --> 04:46.298
And it looks like

04:46.300 --> 04:48.834
you purchased the Buddi 1,
which is this guy.

04:48.836 --> 04:51.269
Listen, I waited
three goddamn weeks

04:51.271 --> 04:53.105
for this ginger piece of shit
to come in the mail.

04:53.107 --> 04:58.043
Okay. Well, I'm so sorry
that you didn't read the box.

04:58.045 --> 05:00.947
And even... There's a window,
that you can see

05:00.949 --> 05:05.216
that his hair is red
and not blonde.

05:05.218 --> 05:06.687
Thanks.

05:07.555 --> 05:09.290
Thanks for shopping
at Zed Mart.

05:23.336 --> 05:24.171
Heh.

05:48.829 --> 05:49.894
Hi.

05:49.896 --> 05:52.199
Hey, uh, I was just...

05:53.401 --> 05:56.000
Whoa. You look like shit.
What happened to you?

05:56.002 --> 05:58.570
Thanks.
And watch your language.

05:58.572 --> 05:59.774
Sorry.

06:01.074 --> 06:03.776
Andy, I told you
to unpack those boxes.

06:03.778 --> 06:05.045
Okay, I know, and I was.

06:05.747 --> 06:07.146
I wanted to make a mental map

06:07.148 --> 06:08.781
of where I should put
everything first.

06:08.783 --> 06:10.683
You know,
for maximum feng shui.

06:10.685 --> 06:12.952
I think you were maximum
feng-shuing so hard,

06:12.954 --> 06:14.086
you forgot to put
your phone down

06:14.088 --> 06:15.421
for five seconds
and feed Rooney.

06:15.423 --> 06:17.055
You mean this busted-ass phone

06:17.057 --> 06:18.558
that we're replacing
for my birthday?

06:18.560 --> 06:20.392
Dude, I've already been
working doubles

06:20.394 --> 06:22.195
to try to get you
a new hearing aid.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.262
I'm fine with this one,

06:24.264 --> 06:27.533
but this is my primary source
of education.

06:27.535 --> 06:29.569
Oh, my God. I never thought
about it like that.

06:29.571 --> 06:31.269
Wait.

06:31.271 --> 06:33.538
Let me see what your education
has been getting you up to.

06:36.677 --> 06:38.911
Oh, my God,
I cannot escape this doll.

06:38.913 --> 06:40.579
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
- No.

06:40.581 --> 06:43.815
Gross. This is staying with me
for the rest of the night.

06:43.817 --> 06:45.416
- What? You...
- No.

06:45.418 --> 06:47.620
You can't do that. That's
the only thing to do here.

06:47.622 --> 06:52.291
There's literally an entire
world of things to do.

06:52.293 --> 06:55.127
Look, two kids standing
in the rain. That looks fun.

06:55.129 --> 06:57.365
They could be anybody.
They could be serial killers.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.765
Noodle.

07:00.767 --> 07:02.668
We talked about this.

07:02.670 --> 07:03.901
You said you were gonna try

07:03.903 --> 07:05.437
to make new friends.

07:05.439 --> 07:08.009
This move is supposed to be
a new start for us.

07:08.908 --> 07:10.909
Tell you what,
you don't have to unpack

07:10.911 --> 07:13.945
or do anything tonight,

07:13.947 --> 07:16.016
if you just go out there
and try.

07:17.451 --> 07:18.687
Give you your phone back.

07:19.687 --> 07:22.090
Okay. I'll be outside.

07:22.857 --> 07:24.457
Really, that was it?

07:43.577 --> 07:45.176
<i>We picked this up
three weeks ago.</i>

07:45.178 --> 07:46.478
But we took it home,
and we turned it on,

07:46.480 --> 07:47.812
and its eyes were red.

07:47.814 --> 07:50.281
And something's wrong with it.

07:50.283 --> 07:51.884
It was just weird.
And I just thought,

07:51.886 --> 07:53.586
with the new one
coming out in two weeks,

07:53.588 --> 07:56.555
it would just be better for me
to take this back, you know,

07:56.557 --> 07:58.089
get it off my hands.

07:58.091 --> 07:59.992
So, I'm just wondering,

07:59.994 --> 08:01.196
can I get my money back?

08:02.564 --> 08:03.364
Yeah.

08:09.836 --> 08:11.038
Hey, Wes!

08:12.072 --> 08:13.438
- Hi.
- Hey, I was just curious.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.240
Um, what happens
to returns like this?

08:16.242 --> 08:18.678
- Oh, uh...
- Like, really damaged returns.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.913
Yeah, we send it back
to Kaslan.

08:20.915 --> 08:22.380
And what do they do with it?

08:22.382 --> 08:23.815
Probably toss it,
trash compactor.

08:23.817 --> 08:24.983
I don't know.
New model's coming out.

08:24.985 --> 08:26.084
No one's gonna
give a rat's ass

08:26.086 --> 08:27.519
about this thing in two weeks.

08:27.521 --> 08:28.954
So, they won't care
if it doesn't make it

08:28.956 --> 08:29.822
on the truck, right?

08:29.824 --> 08:31.457
I care.

08:31.459 --> 08:33.491
Come on, my kid's birthday
is coming up. Can I have it?

08:33.494 --> 08:35.760
- You've got a kid?
- Yes, I've got a kid.

08:35.763 --> 08:38.162
I had a very productive
sweet 16, okay?

08:38.164 --> 08:39.466
If you really wanna know.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.900
Come on.

08:41.903 --> 08:43.370
It'll be our little secret.

08:44.004 --> 08:46.738
- No one has to know.
- Uh...

08:46.740 --> 08:49.141
Just like that time you banged
Susan in the warehouse.

08:49.143 --> 08:50.743
How's your wife, by the way?

08:50.745 --> 08:52.710
Ha-ha.

08:52.712 --> 08:54.714
Can I have it?
Give it to me.

08:56.750 --> 08:58.052
And I'm taking it.

08:58.820 --> 09:00.618
There you go, Wes.

09:00.620 --> 09:01.820
Say hi to your wife.

09:01.822 --> 09:03.323
Yep. Mm-hmm.

09:22.076 --> 09:23.941
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

09:23.943 --> 09:25.777
Hey! Noodle.

09:25.779 --> 09:27.347
You're home early.

09:29.048 --> 09:31.083
- Remember Shane?
- Hey, bud.

09:31.085 --> 09:33.118
It's been a while.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.153
I'm... I'm just gonna
make dinner. You hungry?

09:35.155 --> 09:36.921
No. Uh, I'm gonna go hang out

09:36.923 --> 09:38.458
with some kids
down the hall, actually.

09:39.326 --> 09:40.758
Really, who?

09:40.760 --> 09:42.362
Gotta go. Bye!

10:02.616 --> 10:04.016
So, what are you?

10:04.018 --> 10:05.950
Some kind of fourth floor
hallway hobo,

10:05.952 --> 10:07.420
or something like that?

10:07.721 --> 10:09.088
What?

10:09.090 --> 10:11.656
Andy, right?
You just moved into 401?

10:11.658 --> 10:14.993
Yeah. I see you out here,
like, a lot.

10:14.995 --> 10:18.329
Oh, uh, no, it's not me.

10:18.331 --> 10:20.098
I have, like,
five twin brothers,

10:20.100 --> 10:21.267
so we just take shifts.

10:22.669 --> 10:24.869
Are you comin' in or what?

10:24.871 --> 10:26.671
I'll be right there, Ma.

10:26.673 --> 10:28.040
Just give me a minute.

10:28.042 --> 10:29.643
Love you.

10:31.546 --> 10:33.277
So that's the mom.

10:33.279 --> 10:35.546
She drags me over for dinner
every week.

10:35.548 --> 10:38.349
So, listen, man, if you
wanna have some dinner,

10:38.351 --> 10:40.151
you're welcome to join us,
'cause I could

10:40.153 --> 10:41.686
really use the backup,
'cause she...

10:41.688 --> 10:42.522
Andy?

10:44.359 --> 10:45.426
What's going on?

10:46.126 --> 10:47.626
Is he in trouble?

10:47.628 --> 10:48.993
Yeah. Lots of trouble.

10:48.995 --> 10:50.363
We've been gettin'
lots of complaints about

10:50.365 --> 10:51.863
some kid out here
throwing parties,

10:51.865 --> 10:54.501
selling drugs and beer.

10:55.101 --> 10:57.204
Peddling booze... Um...

10:57.804 --> 10:59.405
Oh.

10:59.407 --> 11:00.873
That was a joke?

11:00.875 --> 11:02.307
It was an attempt.

11:02.309 --> 11:04.041
I was gonna say,
"I'm the fun police."

11:06.147 --> 11:07.448
It's not landing.

11:08.649 --> 11:10.015
Wait, who are you?

11:10.017 --> 11:14.255
I'm Mike... Detective.
Detective Mike.

11:16.389 --> 11:18.857
So, um, I'm just gonna go.

11:18.859 --> 11:21.160
Yeah. I'm gonna go.

11:21.162 --> 11:22.927
All moms are scary,
by the way.

11:22.929 --> 11:24.363
Hurry up, son!

11:24.365 --> 11:25.897
It was nice to meet you,
Andy's mom.

11:25.899 --> 11:27.299
Nice meeting you,
Detective Mike.

11:27.301 --> 11:29.100
- Bye, Mike.
- See you later, Andy.

11:29.102 --> 11:31.337
Dinner ain't
gonna cook itself!

11:31.339 --> 11:34.008
You're screaming, Ma.
Really?

11:34.875 --> 11:36.342
Must you embarrass me
like that?

11:36.344 --> 11:37.743
Ma, you can't be
shouting like that.

11:37.745 --> 11:39.447
I thought you were out
with your friends.

11:41.282 --> 11:42.781
Why didn't you just
come back inside?

11:42.783 --> 11:44.485
Is Shane still there?

11:45.219 --> 11:48.056
No. He's gone.

11:53.427 --> 11:55.730
Come on, I've got
something for you.

11:56.630 --> 11:58.499
It's a surprise.

12:00.868 --> 12:02.270
Close your eyes.

12:11.577 --> 12:12.945
Okay. Hey!

12:12.947 --> 12:15.147
I know it's not your birthday
for a couple weeks,

12:15.149 --> 12:17.382
but this move
has been really tough.

12:17.384 --> 12:20.085
And I know
you're kinda mad at me,

12:20.087 --> 12:21.453
so I think you deserve this.

12:21.455 --> 12:24.057
Surprise!
Early present.

12:38.505 --> 12:39.771
Is that a sigh?

12:39.773 --> 12:41.373
That's the Buddi thing
you're obsessed with.

12:41.375 --> 12:44.343
Yeah, um, it's just...

12:44.345 --> 12:46.445
This thing is for, like,
little kids now.

12:46.447 --> 12:48.079
It came out, like, a year ago.

12:48.081 --> 12:50.848
Okay, I know it's stupid,
but I thought it'd be funny.

12:50.850 --> 12:51.952
Come on!

12:52.486 --> 12:54.652
- Let's try it.
- Okay.

12:54.654 --> 12:56.555
Just remember,
it's refurbished,

12:56.557 --> 12:59.192
so it might not work
perfectly, okay?

13:07.802 --> 13:09.134
<i>Your Buddi is now connected.</i>

13:09.136 --> 13:10.337
Whoa.

13:13.173 --> 13:14.608
Cool.

13:21.315 --> 13:24.552
Hi.
Are you my best buddy?

13:26.153 --> 13:27.522
I guess?

13:31.859 --> 13:33.191
<i>That's bright.</i>

13:33.193 --> 13:34.859
What's your name?

13:34.861 --> 13:36.996
Andy. 'Sup?

13:36.998 --> 13:38.397
Hi, Andysup.

13:40.768 --> 13:42.769
- Sorry.
- What's my name?

13:44.839 --> 13:45.640
Um...

13:47.039 --> 13:48.706
Han Solo.

13:48.708 --> 13:50.975
Did you say Chucky?

13:50.977 --> 13:54.045
What? No.
Not even close.

13:54.047 --> 13:55.647
- Chucky.
- It's...

13:55.649 --> 13:56.714
I like that.

13:56.716 --> 13:58.850
Chucky.

13:58.852 --> 14:00.319
I'm Chucky.

14:00.321 --> 14:02.353
What do you wanna do, Andysup?

14:02.355 --> 14:04.824
Andy. It's just Andy.

14:04.826 --> 14:08.026
Um, I don't know.
Do something cool.

14:08.028 --> 14:10.462
I guess turn on the TV.

14:10.464 --> 14:11.930
<i>I will do that.</i>

14:11.932 --> 14:13.199
What's a TV?

14:13.201 --> 14:15.334
Are you joking?
That thing.

14:15.336 --> 14:17.368
I cannot process that command.

14:17.370 --> 14:18.502
<i>Oh, wait a minute.</i>

14:18.504 --> 14:19.738
<i>It says here you gotta</i>

14:19.740 --> 14:22.674
"sync his knowledge base
to the cloud

14:22.676 --> 14:25.278
"before he can connect to
any other Kaslan products."

14:26.047 --> 14:27.277
<i>Okay, Chucky,</i>

14:27.279 --> 14:28.479
connect to the cloud.

14:28.481 --> 14:30.348
Download.

14:31.719 --> 14:33.218
Learn stuff.

14:35.621 --> 14:37.757
I am unable to do that.

14:43.196 --> 14:44.764
<i>It's kinda creepy.</i>

14:46.133 --> 14:47.632
Doesn't work.

14:47.634 --> 14:48.600
God.

14:48.602 --> 14:50.603
Okay, this thing is stupid.

14:50.605 --> 14:52.237
I didn't know
it was that messed up.

14:52.239 --> 14:53.604
- No, Mom.
- I'll take it back. It's fine.

14:53.606 --> 14:55.840
Mom. Mom, honestly, I like it.

14:55.842 --> 14:58.611
- No, you don't.
- Seriously. It's great.

14:58.613 --> 14:59.780
He's hilarious.

15:00.581 --> 15:02.547
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

15:02.549 --> 15:04.215
It's actually
pretty cool.

15:04.217 --> 15:06.253
Go to bed, Andysup.

15:07.788 --> 15:09.653
Come on.

15:18.264 --> 15:19.730
This is my room.

15:20.933 --> 15:24.435
And that's Mickey Rooney.

15:24.437 --> 15:29.174
He's a total dick,
so just don't touch him.

15:29.176 --> 15:31.075
Total dick.

15:31.077 --> 15:33.012
Whoa.

15:33.014 --> 15:34.715
You're allowed to say that?

15:35.750 --> 15:36.750
Cool.

15:37.118 --> 15:38.416
Uh...

15:38.418 --> 15:40.420
This is my desk.

15:43.255 --> 15:45.290
This is my sketchbook.

15:45.292 --> 15:49.294
I do fake buddy cop
team-ups sometimes.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.764
Like, Dracula and Robin Hood.

15:50.998 --> 15:52.297
Or...

15:52.299 --> 15:54.701
This one's Zorro and Medusa.

15:55.168 --> 15:57.502
Kind of a deep cut.

15:57.504 --> 15:59.774
I don't know, it's stupid.

16:00.508 --> 16:03.141
I do not think it's stupid.

16:03.143 --> 16:04.609
Thanks.

16:04.611 --> 16:06.945
Pity compliments
from a talking doll.

16:06.947 --> 16:07.748
That's my life.

16:09.616 --> 16:12.352
Uh... That's enough
for tonight.

16:15.121 --> 16:17.890
Do you want to sing
the Buddi song before bed?

16:17.892 --> 16:20.459
No. Uh, I'm good.

16:20.461 --> 16:24.829
<i>You are my buddy
until the end</i>

16:24.831 --> 16:30.471
<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

16:34.875 --> 16:38.343
Right.
Totally not weird at all.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.179
Are we having fun now?

16:40.181 --> 16:42.747
Sure. Uh, I guess.

16:42.749 --> 16:43.985
Yay!

16:46.086 --> 16:47.788
Okay.

17:00.868 --> 17:04.868
Is it time to play again?
Are we having fun now?

17:04.871 --> 17:07.508
No. We're having sleep.

17:12.113 --> 17:15.816
Just please close your eyes
and pretend to be less creepy.

17:23.057 --> 17:26.059
You're my
best friend, Andy.

17:27.461 --> 17:31.699
Okay. Stop being so weird.
Quiet time.

17:36.236 --> 17:38.737
<i>You are my buddy</i>

17:38.739 --> 17:41.273
<i>Until the end</i>

17:41.275 --> 17:46.480
<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

17:47.480 --> 17:53.485
<i>I love you more
than you will ever know</i>

17:53.487 --> 17:56.455
- <i>I will never...</i>
- Please shut up.

17:56.457 --> 17:58.859
<i>...let you go</i>

18:01.461 --> 18:03.330
Good night, Andy.

18:36.329 --> 18:39.498
Andy,
you forgot your science book.

18:41.667 --> 18:45.636
Okay, Chucky,
this is not a book.

18:45.638 --> 18:47.841
None of these are books.

18:50.477 --> 18:53.381
Just stay here, okay?

18:55.615 --> 18:57.550
And no more books.

19:11.463 --> 19:13.067
- You're back!
- Jesus!

19:13.433 --> 19:14.634
Whoa!

19:15.836 --> 19:17.137
Were you here the whole time?

19:18.538 --> 19:20.907
I made you a present.

19:24.577 --> 19:26.978
- A busted stick.
- Andy.

19:26.980 --> 19:27.981
Shh.

19:34.153 --> 19:36.889
I don't get
what she sees in Shane.

19:36.891 --> 19:38.657
I mean,

19:38.659 --> 19:39.860
he's not nice.

19:43.128 --> 19:44.595
He's just an asshole.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.968
It doesn't matter anyway.

19:50.770 --> 19:52.972
He's just gonna end up
leaving us,

19:53.773 --> 19:56.074
like everybody else.

19:56.076 --> 19:58.578
I will never leave you.

20:05.318 --> 20:07.552
Are we having fun now?

20:07.554 --> 20:09.953
Yeah. I guess.

20:09.955 --> 20:13.225
Attack? You shouldn't lead
with your chieftain.

20:13.227 --> 20:16.961
I still have to teach you
so much about this. Okay...

20:16.963 --> 20:17.998
Um...

20:30.243 --> 20:34.645
Okay. And I get
to roll again. So...

20:34.647 --> 20:36.815
Boom! Double sixes!

20:36.817 --> 20:38.316
Okay, get that orc outta here.

20:38.318 --> 20:40.318
Total dick.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.054
Nailed that one.

20:42.455 --> 20:43.923
Ow!

20:48.795 --> 20:51.296
- What is that?
- The cat scratched me.

20:51.298 --> 20:52.532
Hurts like hell.

20:53.599 --> 20:56.500
Kitty hurt Andy?

20:56.502 --> 20:59.240
Uh, yeah. Stay here.
I'm gonna go find a Band-Aid.

21:00.272 --> 21:01.241
Stupid Rooney.

21:03.809 --> 21:06.246
I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.

21:18.224 --> 21:20.191
Rooney, I swear to God,
if you don't shut up,

21:20.193 --> 21:22.626
I'm putting you back
on dry food.

21:24.498 --> 21:25.699
Chucky! Stop!

21:29.102 --> 21:32.236
You can't do that, okay?
Why would you do that?

21:32.238 --> 21:36.076
He was hurting you.
He was making you unhappy.

21:39.144 --> 21:42.881
Chucky, okay, listen,
look at me.

21:42.883 --> 21:44.748
This is important.

21:44.750 --> 21:48.353
You can't hurt people,
or cats.

21:48.355 --> 21:49.653
It's not cool.

21:49.655 --> 21:51.722
I know you're different,

21:51.724 --> 21:54.025
but that's gotta be
our secret. Okay?

21:54.027 --> 21:57.328
And don't say any weird shit
or creep people out.

21:57.330 --> 22:00.099
Hey! Cat's freakin' out.

22:02.536 --> 22:04.004
Clean up this room.

22:05.605 --> 22:06.774
Except maybe that guy.

22:10.576 --> 22:12.112
I've got an idea.

22:12.980 --> 22:15.380
Okay. If this is gonna work,

22:15.382 --> 22:17.547
I need you to look as creepy

22:17.549 --> 22:21.384
and scary and angry and mean
as possible. All right?

22:21.386 --> 22:25.259
So, open your eyes
as wide as you can, like...

22:27.294 --> 22:28.927
No, you still look cute.

22:28.929 --> 22:31.062
Open your mouth
as wide as you can

22:31.064 --> 22:33.297
and snarl with your lips.

22:34.468 --> 22:35.603
But kinda smile.

22:36.736 --> 22:38.936
Perfect!
Okay, yes, just like that.

22:38.938 --> 22:40.771
Okay. Try this one.

22:40.773 --> 22:42.175
Smile as wide as you can.

22:43.309 --> 22:44.144
Wider.

22:45.211 --> 22:46.646
Yes!

22:47.114 --> 22:48.979
Yeah, uh...

22:48.981 --> 22:51.050
It's actually
pretty damn creepy.

22:52.484 --> 22:54.384
Okay, you can stop now.

22:56.022 --> 22:57.555
- Franklin! Franklin!
- Ah...

22:57.557 --> 22:59.390
Shit. Sorry.

22:59.392 --> 23:00.525
It's fine.

23:03.730 --> 23:04.932
It's fucking loud.

23:06.666 --> 23:08.167
It's fucking loud.

23:10.403 --> 23:11.769
That thing just swore.

23:11.771 --> 23:13.037
It... It's not supposed
to be able to do that.

23:13.039 --> 23:16.107
Uh, yeah. I know. He, uh...

23:16.109 --> 23:17.909
It doesn't really
follow the rules.

23:17.911 --> 23:20.510
It doesn't follow the rules?

23:20.512 --> 23:21.779
Like it has a choice?

23:21.781 --> 23:23.980
Kinda, yeah.

23:23.982 --> 23:27.017
Sorry, can I pop in here?
So he just does whatever?

23:27.019 --> 23:28.819
You can make him do whatever?

23:28.821 --> 23:30.322
Pretty much.

23:30.324 --> 23:32.123
Okay, can I just point out
that this is how

23:32.125 --> 23:34.193
every robot apocalypse
scenario begins?

23:35.662 --> 23:38.196
- Say "dick cheese."
- Dick cheese.

23:39.599 --> 23:41.132
That is the coolest.

23:41.134 --> 23:42.767
I have so many
questions. Uh, who are you?

23:42.769 --> 23:44.969
His name is Andysup.

23:44.971 --> 23:47.875
- I'm Andy.
- Falyn. Pugg.

23:48.775 --> 23:51.109
Why are you in the hall?

23:51.111 --> 23:52.943
Uh, I was gonna try
and teach him

23:52.945 --> 23:54.845
to creep out
my mom's boyfriend,

23:54.847 --> 23:56.413
but probably a bad idea.

23:56.415 --> 23:58.182
You're wrong.
It's perfect.

23:58.184 --> 24:00.721
And we're doing it right now.

24:19.006 --> 24:22.076
Jesus! Fuck! Fuckin'...

24:25.244 --> 24:26.443
Karen!

24:26.445 --> 24:28.144
- <i>Karen!</i>
- Oh, check it out.

24:28.146 --> 24:29.982
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God.

24:30.884 --> 24:32.651
This is legendary.

24:36.689 --> 24:37.755
- Hey!
- Hi!

24:37.757 --> 24:38.922
We're here for Andy.

24:38.924 --> 24:40.491
Let's move, dick turd.

24:40.493 --> 24:42.826
- Who are you?
- Falyn and Pugg.

24:42.828 --> 24:44.327
Those are names?
Falyn and Pugg?

24:44.329 --> 24:46.564
- Hey. Ready?
- Yeah. Be back later!

24:46.566 --> 24:48.699
- Your sister's pretty hot.
- Dude, that's my mom.

24:48.701 --> 24:50.403
Heh. Even hotter.

25:16.028 --> 25:17.327
You sure the janitor guy

25:17.329 --> 25:19.029
is not gonna get
any shit for this?

25:19.031 --> 25:21.432
Who cares?
Guy's a total creep.

25:21.434 --> 25:23.934
Is that thing busted?
It's kinda weird looking.

25:23.936 --> 25:25.972
No. He's just different.

25:29.643 --> 25:32.209
Now say, "This is for Tupac!"

25:32.211 --> 25:34.245
Do you wanna sing
the Buddi song?

25:34.247 --> 25:36.914
No! Say, "This is for Tupac,"
and stab the asshole.

25:36.916 --> 25:38.382
- Come on!
- But I want to.

25:38.384 --> 25:40.517
We want this
to go viral. He for real?

25:40.519 --> 25:42.519
<i>You are my buddy...</i>

25:42.521 --> 25:44.956
That's enough.
Time to go, Chucky.

25:44.958 --> 25:46.160
Narc alert. Shut up, shut up.

25:48.227 --> 25:50.928
Narc alert. Shut up, shut up.

25:50.930 --> 25:52.963
I just got owned.

25:54.634 --> 25:56.804
Little fucking millennials.

26:02.942 --> 26:04.808
Andy, you wanna play now?

26:04.810 --> 26:06.677
Not now, Chucky.

26:06.679 --> 26:07.978
This is ridiculous.

26:11.417 --> 26:12.949
Wait for it.

26:12.951 --> 26:14.421
Wait for it...

26:15.255 --> 26:18.221
<i>Time for incoming mail!</i>

26:18.223 --> 26:20.190
<i>One, and a-two...</i>

26:20.192 --> 26:21.394
- Heads up, bitch!
- <i>...and a-three!</i>

26:21.862 --> 26:23.228
Boom!

26:25.865 --> 26:26.933
Yes!

26:31.104 --> 26:32.439
Did you see that?

26:51.423 --> 26:53.592
What the hell?
What even is that?

26:53.594 --> 26:56.026
I don't know,
I bought it at a store.

26:56.028 --> 26:57.461
It's so unrealistic.

26:57.463 --> 26:58.662
And specific.

27:01.201 --> 27:03.334
Are all horror movies
like this?

27:03.336 --> 27:04.803
- No.
- Pretty much.

27:04.805 --> 27:06.536
- Yes, they are.
- No, they're not.

27:08.842 --> 27:11.209
Oh. Gross.
Is that his face?

27:11.211 --> 27:13.279
What the hell?

27:14.047 --> 27:15.345
Are you fucking watching this?

27:15.347 --> 27:17.114
That wouldn't even happen.

27:20.820 --> 27:22.420
Heads up, bitch.

27:22.422 --> 27:23.423
Andy.

27:25.392 --> 27:27.357
<i>Wait for it.</i>

27:27.359 --> 27:29.227
That is priceless.

27:29.229 --> 27:30.761
Heads up, bitch.
Heads up, bitch.

27:30.763 --> 27:33.029
Chucky? Put down the knife.

27:33.031 --> 27:34.367
- Heads up, bitch.
- Andy!

27:34.867 --> 27:35.903
Chucky!

27:36.536 --> 27:38.370
Stop!

27:41.607 --> 27:42.740
What is wrong with you?

27:42.742 --> 27:44.875
I, uh...

27:44.877 --> 27:47.246
I thought it would
make you happy.

27:58.424 --> 28:00.293
I'm sorry, Andy.

28:01.361 --> 28:03.463
I'm going out
with Falyn and Pugg.

28:10.703 --> 28:14.205
I have never baked
anything in my life before,

28:14.207 --> 28:16.643
but look how good they look!

28:17.743 --> 28:20.313
Mmm, I'm not really hungry.
I'm gonna grab another beer.

28:22.781 --> 28:24.449
They do look good though.

28:24.451 --> 28:25.682
Okay.

28:32.892 --> 28:34.394
It's good.

28:40.599 --> 28:41.534
Jesus!

28:43.269 --> 28:46.336
<i>Shane's such an asshole.</i>

28:46.338 --> 28:49.472
<i>Shane's such an asshole.
Such an asshole.</i>

28:49.474 --> 28:51.008
- Do you hear that?
- <i>Such an asshole.</i>

28:51.010 --> 28:52.642
<i>Shane's such an asshole.</i>

28:53.846 --> 28:55.212
Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me.

28:55.214 --> 28:57.680
<i>Shane's such an asshole.</i>

28:58.917 --> 29:00.319
You think that's funny?

29:02.788 --> 29:04.456
<i>Such an asshole.
Shane's such an asshole.</i>

29:04.458 --> 29:06.660
<i>I didn't make him
say anything!</i>

29:07.759 --> 29:09.193
Okay. You know what?

29:09.195 --> 29:10.227
You're spending less time
with this thing.

29:10.229 --> 29:11.863
<i>One hour a day, tops.</i>

29:11.865 --> 29:13.363
<i>And the rest of the time,
he's going in here.</i>

29:13.365 --> 29:14.965
<i>Mom, stop,
you're gonna scare him!</i>

29:14.967 --> 29:16.467
<i>It's a toy.</i>

29:16.469 --> 29:18.138
<i>You don't have to bring him
into this.</i>

29:19.838 --> 29:21.471
It's a toy, Andy.

29:21.473 --> 29:23.841
And he keeps
freaking out Rooney, okay?

29:23.843 --> 29:25.241
<i>So I'm keeping them separated.</i>

29:25.243 --> 29:27.045
<i>I can keep him away
from Rooney</i>

29:27.047 --> 29:28.446
<i>if he stays in my room.</i>

29:28.448 --> 29:31.018
He's staying in there,
that is final!

31:06.878 --> 31:07.746
Rooney!

31:11.183 --> 31:12.751
Chucky?

31:14.086 --> 31:15.620
Did you do this?

31:15.622 --> 31:19.722
Kitty made us unhappy.
Now we can play again.

31:19.724 --> 31:22.392
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

31:22.394 --> 31:23.896
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

31:24.963 --> 31:27.296
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

31:27.298 --> 31:29.299
<i>I swear,
I'm so sick of this...</i>

31:29.301 --> 31:31.170
<i>...swear,
I'm so sick of this cat.</i>

31:42.348 --> 31:43.814
<i>Uh, no, absolutely not.</i>

31:43.816 --> 31:45.082
<i>I'm not working
the Buddi 2 launch.</i>

31:45.084 --> 31:46.517
It is my kid's birthday,

31:46.519 --> 31:48.017
and I'm not doing
night shifts anymore.

31:48.019 --> 31:49.987
Hey, have you seen Rooney?
Psst, psst, psst...

31:49.989 --> 31:52.657
Shane left the door
open. Maybe he got out.

31:52.659 --> 31:56.196
Why is the door
being left open?

33:12.538 --> 33:15.738
Hey. We are ordering pizza.

33:15.740 --> 33:17.743
You hungry? What do you want?

33:21.180 --> 33:23.016
Hello? Pizza.

33:27.186 --> 33:28.520
Andy.

33:28.887 --> 33:30.020
What?

33:30.022 --> 33:32.055
- Where are you going?
- Pugg's.

33:32.057 --> 33:33.224
Don't forget your little doll.

33:33.226 --> 33:34.027
Don't want it.

33:36.261 --> 33:37.761
Seriously,
what did I do?

33:37.763 --> 33:39.765
Every time I walk in a room,
he leaves.

33:40.598 --> 33:42.865
That is not true, at all.

33:42.867 --> 33:44.735
Andy's just
a bit different, okay?

33:44.737 --> 33:47.007
Kid can't even be
in the same room as me.

34:06.558 --> 34:09.963
<i>Are you my b-b-b-best buddy?</i>

34:45.998 --> 34:48.666
- <i>Asshole.</i>
- Oh, Jesus!

34:48.668 --> 34:51.034
<i>Shane's such an asshole.
Shane's such an asshole.</i>

34:51.036 --> 34:52.436
God damn it!

34:52.438 --> 34:53.938
<i>Such an asshole.
Such an asshole.</i>

34:53.940 --> 34:55.838
Goddamn kid!

34:55.840 --> 34:57.476
Hey!

34:59.010 --> 35:01.646
You got a problem with me,
you say it, okay?

35:01.648 --> 35:03.083
No more using
your little doll.

35:03.849 --> 35:04.981
Mom!

35:04.983 --> 35:07.554
Sit down!
I'm not through with you.

35:12.358 --> 35:13.960
<i>Now you got a problem with me,</i>

35:14.693 --> 35:17.461
you be a man and you say it.

35:17.463 --> 35:19.999
Come on. Let's hear it.

35:27.340 --> 35:28.575
Yeah.

35:29.507 --> 35:31.910
That's what I thought.

35:36.648 --> 35:38.349
I hate him.
I hate him so much!

35:38.351 --> 35:39.753
Why can't he just
leave us alone?

35:41.619 --> 35:43.655
Why can't he just go away?

35:44.856 --> 35:46.490
I just want him gone.

35:46.492 --> 35:47.894
I just wish
he would leave us alone.

35:50.896 --> 35:53.798
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm just saying he's my son,

35:53.800 --> 35:55.699
so if you have a problem
with him,

35:55.701 --> 35:57.668
talk to me,
and then I'll talk to him.

35:57.670 --> 35:59.036
Because you're not
his dad and...

35:59.038 --> 36:00.237
Yeah, I get it.

36:00.239 --> 36:01.804
Look, he was being rude,
and I called him on it.

36:01.806 --> 36:03.141
I just think
it's too much.

36:03.143 --> 36:04.708
All I did
was I talked to him.

36:04.710 --> 36:05.809
It's a little much,
that's all.

36:05.811 --> 36:07.345
You know what? Fuck it.

36:07.347 --> 36:09.949
Sounds like a "you" problem,
not a "me" problem.

36:18.023 --> 36:20.559
Yes, I know.

36:21.460 --> 36:22.659
Listen, just listen,

36:22.661 --> 36:24.262
I am getting
fucking pissed on, okay?

36:24.264 --> 36:25.628
I work hard enough as it is,

36:25.630 --> 36:27.800
and I'm not having this
goddamn conversation!

37:16.815 --> 37:18.349
Hey, hey, hey!
There's my girls!

37:18.351 --> 37:19.816
Daddy!

37:19.818 --> 37:22.885
- Oh, boy, you guys are so big!
- Daddy! Daddy!

37:22.887 --> 37:25.924
Fucking Christmas
lights. Just leave 'em up.

37:26.925 --> 37:29.027
I don't do enough around here?

37:44.309 --> 37:47.045
I guess I should've fucking
unplugged them first.

37:55.653 --> 37:57.056
Oh, fuck!

38:08.233 --> 38:10.166
Goddamn raccoons.

38:10.168 --> 38:11.871
Get out of here!

38:28.887 --> 38:31.354
Oh, God!

38:31.356 --> 38:34.726
Oh, God!
Jane, help!

39:50.635 --> 39:51.702
It's tickle time!

39:51.704 --> 39:53.137
Jane! Help!

39:53.139 --> 39:56.175
Nobody hurts my best buddy!

40:10.755 --> 40:12.958
This is for Tupac.

40:19.831 --> 40:22.166
Body was stabbed
13 times.

40:22.168 --> 40:24.934
I just bought
these fucking shoes.

40:24.936 --> 40:26.869
Where we at
with print casting?

40:26.871 --> 40:29.673
Only other prints
look to fit a toddler.

40:29.675 --> 40:31.307
Shit.

40:31.309 --> 40:32.277
Wife says he came here
straight home from work.

40:34.112 --> 40:35.147
Oh.

40:38.516 --> 40:40.252
Tsk. Yeah.

40:41.619 --> 40:43.987
I'm not sure that's true.

40:46.826 --> 40:49.693
White guy dead
in a watermelon patch.

40:49.695 --> 40:51.364
Poetic.

41:20.659 --> 41:22.260
What the fuck?

41:25.731 --> 41:26.996
Surprise!

41:26.998 --> 41:29.566
Now we can play again.

41:29.568 --> 41:32.469
What? What? Why?

41:32.471 --> 41:35.338
I'd do anything
for my best buddy.

41:35.340 --> 41:38.007
What? No!
No, I didn't want this!

41:38.009 --> 41:39.742
Why would I want this?

41:39.744 --> 41:41.878
Holy shit!

41:41.880 --> 41:43.348
Why would you do this, Chucky?

41:44.282 --> 41:45.949
<i>I just want him gone.</i>

41:45.951 --> 41:46.983
<i>I just wish
he would leave us alone.</i>

41:46.985 --> 41:47.818
<i>I just want him gone.</i>

41:47.820 --> 41:49.753
No! No, stop!

41:49.755 --> 41:51.920
Stop!

41:51.922 --> 41:54.358
<i>Wish he would leave us alone.
Wish he would leave us alone.</i>

41:54.360 --> 41:56.128
Andy, stop.

42:06.739 --> 42:08.472
You beckoned?

42:08.474 --> 42:10.309
What's the problemo?

42:15.947 --> 42:17.481
Where's the rest of him?

42:17.483 --> 42:18.648
Why?

42:18.650 --> 42:20.182
I... I don't know!

42:20.184 --> 42:21.952
There's a bow on its head.

42:21.954 --> 42:23.287
Shit, shit!

42:23.289 --> 42:24.854
We saw the signs,
and we did nothing!

42:24.856 --> 42:26.155
This is all our fault.

42:26.157 --> 42:28.525
- We saw the signs.
- Stop saying that!

42:28.527 --> 42:30.226
What do I do?
Do I call the cops?

42:30.228 --> 42:31.494
- No.
- He's dead.

42:31.496 --> 42:32.595
I can tell them the truth.

42:32.597 --> 42:34.264
Tell them the truth? Sure.

42:34.266 --> 42:36.633
We tell them
that a dead guy's face skin

42:36.635 --> 42:38.168
ended up in your room

42:38.170 --> 42:40.235
because your toy went
full-blown psycho killer.

42:40.237 --> 42:42.072
- Let's see how that goes.
- Oh.

42:42.074 --> 42:44.842
Oh, it's winking at me.
I can't look at it anymore.

42:44.844 --> 42:46.041
We gotta hide the evidence.

42:46.043 --> 42:47.346
In what?

42:55.288 --> 42:56.355
Shit.

42:57.489 --> 42:59.588
Ugh, is that brain?

42:59.590 --> 43:01.258
The skin's on a melon.

43:01.260 --> 43:03.462
Why is there a fruit involved?

43:04.864 --> 43:06.496
Just go straight
to the garbage chute

43:06.498 --> 43:07.798
and make the drop.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.499
- Right.
- And if anybody stops you,

43:09.501 --> 43:11.400
say you have crazy diarrhea
or something, no time to talk.

43:16.507 --> 43:18.108
Hi, Mom.

43:18.110 --> 43:21.012
Hi, Andy.
Why are you not in school?

43:21.612 --> 43:23.281
Um, crazy diarrhea.

43:24.349 --> 43:26.983
Okay, got it.
Um, what is that?

43:26.985 --> 43:29.186
It's a present.

43:29.188 --> 43:30.489
Present? For who?

43:31.123 --> 43:33.889
Um, the old lady
down the hall,

43:33.891 --> 43:36.291
because she helps me
with homework.

43:36.293 --> 43:38.327
- So, I made her a thing.
- Cool.

43:38.329 --> 43:39.963
And you guys helped him
with this?

43:39.965 --> 43:41.030
No, it was all him.
It was him.

43:41.032 --> 43:42.900
No, no. Yeah.

43:42.902 --> 43:44.403
Let's go deliver it.
The present.

43:47.005 --> 43:48.371
What?

43:50.041 --> 43:52.008
- Oh!
- Hi, Doreen.

43:52.010 --> 43:53.476
Isn't this a surprise!

43:53.478 --> 43:54.543
I know.

43:54.545 --> 43:56.414
Hi. Um...

43:57.650 --> 43:59.318
This is for you.

44:00.485 --> 44:04.153
- Wow...
- For all of the homework stuff

44:04.155 --> 44:05.688
that you helped him with.
Right?

44:05.690 --> 44:06.692
Mm-hmm.

44:06.958 --> 44:08.992
Tsk. Oh!

44:08.994 --> 44:10.860
Oh, yeah. Of course!

44:10.862 --> 44:12.461
Of course, yeah.

44:12.463 --> 44:14.900
Always happy to help
such a sweet boy.

44:18.436 --> 44:19.471
Give it to her.

44:19.871 --> 44:21.037
Oh.

44:21.039 --> 44:22.405
Butterfingers over here.

44:22.407 --> 44:23.940
Oh, it's heavy.

44:23.942 --> 44:26.409
I hope it's not fragile.

44:26.411 --> 44:27.845
I just wanna know what it is.
Open it.

44:27.847 --> 44:28.912
Yeah.

44:28.914 --> 44:30.447
No! No! Don't! Don't!

44:30.449 --> 44:31.815
Um...

44:31.817 --> 44:35.050
My birthday is next week,
and we can open it then.

44:35.052 --> 44:36.619
Together.

44:36.621 --> 44:39.722
Okay, that's a very strange
and lovely thought.

44:39.724 --> 44:42.527
So, I'll just go put it
on the shelf until then.

44:42.994 --> 44:45.028
- Okay? Okay.
- Okay.

44:45.030 --> 44:47.197
- All right. Thank you.
- No problem.

44:47.199 --> 44:49.599
- And, Doreen...
- Bye.

44:49.601 --> 44:52.235
Stupid!
Why did we use wrapping paper?

44:52.237 --> 44:54.438
It's fine.
It's fine, okay?

44:54.440 --> 44:56.206
We have till my birthday,
next Friday.

44:56.208 --> 44:58.374
I'll get rid of it.
Don't worry.

44:58.376 --> 45:00.110
You guys are worried
about the head?

45:00.112 --> 45:02.378
You've got a killer doll
in your closet.

45:02.380 --> 45:03.914
And you know what we gotta do.

45:03.916 --> 45:05.081
Shit.

45:05.083 --> 45:06.318
Pugg!

45:24.101 --> 45:26.071
You left me all alone.

45:26.838 --> 45:28.574
I don't like the closet.

45:29.041 --> 45:31.675
I know, Chucky.

45:31.677 --> 45:33.175
Drop the knife.

45:33.177 --> 45:34.811
You're my best buddy.

45:34.813 --> 45:37.046
I just want you to be happy.

45:37.048 --> 45:39.083
I know, buddy.

45:39.085 --> 45:40.450
And we're gonna go play now,

45:40.452 --> 45:42.989
but you've gotta drop
the knife, okay?

45:50.695 --> 45:54.099
Come on. Let's go play.

46:04.443 --> 46:05.478
Come on.

46:11.050 --> 46:13.115
Come on. In here.

46:13.117 --> 46:14.686
Are we having fun now?

46:18.190 --> 46:19.121
Andy,
what's happening?

46:19.123 --> 46:20.591
Now, Andy, now! Now!

46:21.025 --> 46:22.791
Andy?

46:24.128 --> 46:25.494
Why are you doing this?

46:25.496 --> 46:27.030
They're trying
to hurt me, Andy.

46:27.032 --> 46:28.865
How is he so strong?

46:28.867 --> 46:29.668
Andy!

46:31.302 --> 46:33.605
I'm sorry, Chucky.
It's the only way.

46:34.306 --> 46:35.572
But you're my friend!

46:35.574 --> 46:37.307
What are you waiting for?
Do it!

46:37.309 --> 46:41.413
<i>You are my buddy
until the end</i>

46:41.980 --> 46:43.179
Andy!

46:43.181 --> 46:44.416
Come on.

47:10.041 --> 47:11.309
That's it.

47:12.577 --> 47:15.614
We never talk about what
happened tonight to anybody.

47:47.045 --> 47:48.280
Oh.

47:51.615 --> 47:52.650
Jackpot.

48:26.918 --> 48:28.251
Ah!

48:28.253 --> 48:30.653
There you are.

48:30.655 --> 48:34.692
The connectivity's down,
but not in bad shape overall.

48:35.527 --> 48:37.327
I'll make a pretty penny
on resale

48:37.329 --> 48:38.831
once we get you sorted.

48:41.432 --> 48:44.034
Time to open you up.

48:44.036 --> 48:45.704
Let's see
what we're dealing with.

48:51.610 --> 48:52.678
So stupid.

48:54.980 --> 48:56.648
How could I be so stupid?

49:04.822 --> 49:05.723
Hey.

49:07.126 --> 49:08.227
Um...

49:10.862 --> 49:12.628
I'm gonna be right back, okay?
Just stay here.

49:12.630 --> 49:13.798
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:16.534 --> 49:20.570
Hey, man. Don't worry, okay?

49:20.572 --> 49:23.642
My partner is just asking her
some routine questions.

49:29.146 --> 49:29.949
Hey.

49:31.983 --> 49:33.219
I love you.

49:40.726 --> 49:41.727
Okay.

49:48.032 --> 49:49.666
Hey. Um...

49:49.668 --> 49:52.738
Still want some backup with
your mom for some dinner?

49:53.838 --> 49:54.806
Hmm.

49:55.139 --> 49:56.342
We're good.

49:57.842 --> 49:59.844
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
Come on.

50:14.025 --> 50:15.726
<i>This is...
Okay, all right.</i>

50:15.728 --> 50:17.559
- <i>He doesn't know about it yet.</i>
- Andy?

50:17.561 --> 50:19.195
- <i>No, I'll just ask Andy.</i>
- <i>Sure.</i>

50:19.197 --> 50:20.795
Andy!

50:20.797 --> 50:21.798
<i>Okay. I have
an announcement to make.</i>

50:21.800 --> 50:23.266
I downloaded...

50:23.268 --> 50:24.568
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

50:24.570 --> 50:26.735
- The Kaslan app.
- Okay.

50:26.737 --> 50:29.106
- The Kaslan drive.
- Kaslan drive.

50:29.108 --> 50:30.940
I thought it was a dating app.
Oh, my God.

50:30.942 --> 50:32.708
You are so silly!

50:32.710 --> 50:34.443
Can you imagine
if she was out here dating?

50:34.445 --> 50:36.378
And so what? I'm desirable.

50:36.380 --> 50:37.847
Excuse me.

50:37.849 --> 50:39.615
Anyway, Andy, help me
figure this thing out.

50:39.617 --> 50:40.916
Okay.

50:40.918 --> 50:42.786
So, here's the app.
What do I do?

50:42.788 --> 50:44.621
- Okay. So, once you sign up...
- Mm-hmm.

50:44.623 --> 50:46.657
...you just press this button

50:46.659 --> 50:48.724
and the car will show up
to wherever you are,

50:48.726 --> 50:50.159
take you wherever you want.
It's super easy.

50:50.161 --> 50:52.162
<i>No, wait.
It'll drive me to Bingo,</i>

50:52.164 --> 50:54.095
<i>and I don't have to worry
about this bozo</i>

50:54.097 --> 50:55.298
<i>driving me around?</i>

50:55.300 --> 50:56.999
<i>Yeah.</i>

50:57.001 --> 50:58.867
<i>Andy, you're my
new best friend.</i>

50:58.869 --> 51:00.436
I don't want you going
out there alone, okay?

51:00.438 --> 51:01.804
'Cause it's not safe.

51:01.806 --> 51:03.572
The only thing not safe

51:03.574 --> 51:05.575
- around here is your cooking.
- Oh, is that right?

51:05.577 --> 51:06.608
- 'Cause, um, I can...
- Yeah.

51:06.610 --> 51:07.811
Poor Andy gotta suffer...

51:07.813 --> 51:09.479
It tastes like instant!

51:09.481 --> 51:10.947
It's good. I think it's good.

51:10.949 --> 51:12.514
- You know what?
- Thank you, Andy.

51:12.516 --> 51:14.483
You are just too sweet
for your own good, Andy.

51:14.485 --> 51:16.751
That's all.
Don't be influenced by him.

51:16.753 --> 51:18.787
I learned my cooking
from you, you know?

51:18.789 --> 51:20.423
Yeah,
'cause I can cook.

51:23.293 --> 51:25.528
Oh, God...

51:25.530 --> 51:27.229
- Hey, Ma.
- Yeah, baby.

51:27.231 --> 51:29.132
You been to vintage shoppin'
again? 'Cause that looks new.

51:29.134 --> 51:30.432
Oh!

51:30.434 --> 51:32.601
Andy made this for me.

51:32.603 --> 51:34.838
Oh, and we are gonna...

51:34.840 --> 51:37.974
Yeah, I know. It's heavy.

51:37.976 --> 51:40.610
And we are gonna open it
on his birthday.

51:40.612 --> 51:43.144
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm.

51:43.146 --> 51:46.014
Tell me, when's the last time
you made me anything?

51:46.016 --> 51:47.284
Uh, never.

51:47.286 --> 51:48.854
Oh, wow, okay.

51:49.454 --> 51:51.724
Oh, my God, moms, right?

51:57.996 --> 51:59.963
Look, um...

51:59.965 --> 52:01.363
I know that people
have probably been

52:01.365 --> 52:02.798
talking to you about me,

52:02.800 --> 52:04.867
but, uh, don't believe
everything you hear.

52:04.869 --> 52:08.037
You know, this neighborhood
has a lot of bad influences.

52:08.039 --> 52:08.907
You know what I mean?

52:11.842 --> 52:14.209
People like to keep
their mouth shut.

52:14.211 --> 52:16.878
You know,
thinking they need to fit in,

52:16.880 --> 52:18.780
but fitting in
isn't always a good thing.

52:18.782 --> 52:20.150
You know what I mean?

52:20.152 --> 52:21.617
Gotta be careful
who you hanging around

52:21.619 --> 52:22.918
in a place like this.

52:25.556 --> 52:27.590
When you get a bit older
and you start to realize

52:27.592 --> 52:28.927
that it's just...

52:32.664 --> 52:34.863
Even the hearing impaired
don't wanna listen to me.

52:34.865 --> 52:37.135
That is fantastic.

53:17.141 --> 53:18.441
<i>Your Buddi is now connected.</i>

53:18.443 --> 53:20.443

- Yes.

53:22.648 --> 53:24.514

to Kaslan products, right?

53:24.516 --> 53:26.916

Shit! No.

56:58.730 --> 57:00.028
Guess what Omar got.

57:00.030 --> 57:02.865
Someone left it
outside his door.

57:15.480 --> 57:17.412
My Buddi actually works.

57:17.414 --> 57:19.117
I named him Chode.

57:23.054 --> 57:25.454
Check this out.
Hey, Chode.

57:25.456 --> 57:26.958
Salute your master.

57:28.826 --> 57:31.026
Hey, master.

57:31.028 --> 57:32.695

58:12.938 --> 58:14.836
Oh, my God.

58:36.860 --> 58:39.360
- Do you wanna play now?
- Chode, go away.

58:39.362 --> 58:42.331
That's no way
to treat your best friend.

58:42.333 --> 58:43.865

01:03:26.684 --> 01:03:28.483
<i>I'm sorry.
I do not understand.</i>

01:03:28.485 --> 01:03:29.753
Whoa!

01:03:47.704 --> 01:03:48.836
No! No! No!

01:03:48.838 --> 01:03:50.141
No!

01:03:56.614 --> 01:03:58.349
<i>Nobody steals my friend.</i>

01:04:07.025 --> 01:04:07.858
Help me, Jesus!

01:04:15.331 --> 01:04:18.032
Andy's my best friend.

01:04:18.034 --> 01:04:20.237
You hobbit motherfucker!

01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:23.141
Oh!

01:04:25.543 --> 01:04:26.941
<i>Passenger airbag</i>

01:04:26.943 --> 01:04:28.144
- <i>has been turned off.</i>
- Wait!

01:04:28.146 --> 01:04:29.180
<i>Seatbelt disengaged.</i>

01:04:30.047 --> 01:04:31.782
Heads up, bitch.

01:04:32.983 --> 01:04:34.485
Please!

01:04:41.858 --> 01:04:44.025
<i>You have
arrived at your destination.</i>

01:04:48.733 --> 01:04:50.835
<i>I see you.</i>

01:05:01.778 --> 01:05:03.715
<i>Peekaboo.</i>

01:05:26.237 --> 01:05:28.572
<i>Doreen...</i>

01:05:31.275 --> 01:05:33.541
<i>I said, "Peekaboo!"</i>

01:05:36.512 --> 01:05:38.715
<i>I saw Doreen outside.</i>

01:05:39.817 --> 01:05:44.153
Mom, I think Chucky did
something to her.

01:05:44.155 --> 01:05:45.256
Sweetie...

01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:48.525
Chucky is a toy.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.226
Okay?
It broke.

01:05:51.228 --> 01:05:52.728
- You got rid of it.
- No, Mom.

01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:55.731
I... I saw him.
I saw him following Doreen.

01:05:55.733 --> 01:05:58.432
No, you didn't.
Listen to what you're saying.

01:05:58.434 --> 01:06:00.235
Mom, he's gonna kill her!

01:06:00.237 --> 01:06:01.403
He probably
already did kill her!

01:06:01.405 --> 01:06:03.072
Why are you doing this?

01:06:03.074 --> 01:06:04.639
Please, just be honest with me

01:06:04.641 --> 01:06:06.775
and tell me
what happened to Rooney.

01:06:06.777 --> 01:06:08.075
It was Chucky!

01:06:08.077 --> 01:06:09.177
Chucky?

01:06:09.179 --> 01:06:10.244
Why aren't you listening
to me?

01:06:10.246 --> 01:06:11.613
I have it on Omar's phone.

01:06:11.615 --> 01:06:14.583
He's following Doreen.
I can show you.

01:06:14.585 --> 01:06:16.353
Why do you have Omar's phone?

01:06:17.021 --> 01:06:17.955
I took it.

01:06:18.155 --> 01:06:19.320
Why?

01:06:19.322 --> 01:06:20.990
I had to. I...

01:06:20.992 --> 01:06:22.825
I had to follow Chucky, Mom.

01:06:22.827 --> 01:06:23.958
Okay.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.193
I'm not crazy, Mom!

01:06:25.195 --> 01:06:26.427
I'm giving this back to him.

01:06:26.429 --> 01:06:28.363
Mom, no one's
listening to me. Please.

01:06:28.365 --> 01:06:29.530
I have to
give this back to him

01:06:29.532 --> 01:06:30.565
so this doesn't get any worse.

01:06:30.567 --> 01:06:31.867
Nobody's listening to me!

01:06:31.869 --> 01:06:33.467
- Just stay right here, okay?
- Mom!

01:06:33.469 --> 01:06:34.936
And you're coming
to work with me.

01:06:34.938 --> 01:06:36.037
He's trying to kill us!

01:06:36.039 --> 01:06:36.907
Do not move.

01:06:46.317 --> 01:06:48.786
Oh, shit. Shit.

01:07:10.641 --> 01:07:11.809
<i>You don't know that.</i>

01:07:15.646 --> 01:07:18.815
<i>We barely know this kid.
He could be batshit crazy.</i>

01:07:20.985 --> 01:07:23.988
<i>What if
Chucky never malfunctioned?</i>

01:07:25.556 --> 01:07:28.889
<i>He just...
He just made it all up?</i>

01:07:28.891 --> 01:07:30.492
- <i>What if he killed...</i>
- <i>Shut up.</i>

01:07:30.494 --> 01:07:32.226
<i>I've watched them,
Andy.</i>

01:07:35.231 --> 01:07:37.067
<i>I've seen how they hurt you.</i>

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:47.809
<i>Over here, Andy!</i>

01:07:47.811 --> 01:07:49.445
Leave me alone!

01:07:49.447 --> 01:07:51.880
<i>Over here.</i>

01:07:51.882 --> 01:07:54.249
<i>If they don't let us play,</i>

01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:57.088
<i>they all go away.</i>

01:07:59.489 --> 01:08:00.757
Why are you doing this?

01:08:02.659 --> 01:08:04.928
<i>Are we having fun now?</i>

01:08:08.833 --> 01:08:11.599
<i>Are you my best buddy?</i>

01:08:11.601 --> 01:08:13.702
<i>If they don't
let us play,</i>

01:08:13.704 --> 01:08:16.573
<i>they all go away.</i>

01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:20.810
<i>Peekaboo.</i>

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:27.752
Stop!

01:08:32.256 --> 01:08:33.090
Turn it off!

01:08:36.292 --> 01:08:37.493
Turn it off!

01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:40.765
Turn it off!

01:08:52.777 --> 01:08:54.276
<i>But the chance of rain tonight</i>

01:08:54.278 --> 01:08:56.143
<i>won't dampen the spirits
of Buddi fans,</i>

01:08:56.145 --> 01:08:58.112
<i>as this is the night
they have been waiting for.</i>

01:08:58.113 --> 01:08:59.881
<i>That's right,
people have been lining up</i>

01:08:59.884 --> 01:09:02.417
<i>for the midnight release
of Buddi 2.</i>

01:09:14.832 --> 01:09:16.298
<i>All units. All units,</i>

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.898
<i>be advised that the deceased</i>

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:20.301
<i>is an African American female
in her 70s.</i>

01:09:20.304 --> 01:09:21.136
<i>Ten-four.</i>

01:09:25.175 --> 01:09:26.609
Ma'am, you okay?

01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:28.943
<i>It's Doreen.</i>

01:09:28.944 --> 01:09:32.483
I think she's dead.
There are cops everywhere.

01:09:33.448 --> 01:09:34.952
What if Chucky's...

01:09:36.353 --> 01:09:37.953
What if Andy is right?

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:40.621
The hell you want?

01:09:40.622 --> 01:09:42.456
Omar, show us your Buddi.

01:09:42.457 --> 01:09:43.759
It's gone.

01:09:43.761 --> 01:09:45.460
- Fuck!
- Since when? Where is it?

01:09:45.462 --> 01:09:46.761
Why don't you ask Andy?

01:09:46.764 --> 01:09:48.429
That asshole's
been taking my shit.

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:49.497
Give me your phone.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.432
Are you gonna steal it, too?

01:09:51.568 --> 01:09:53.604
Give me your phone now.

01:10:04.515 --> 01:10:06.214
<i>A Kaslan Kar.</i>

01:10:06.216 --> 01:10:07.316
What the hell?

01:10:07.318 --> 01:10:09.017
No.

01:10:09.019 --> 01:10:10.621
Holy shit.

01:10:11.421 --> 01:10:12.989
He was right.

01:10:17.427 --> 01:10:19.029
Andy.

01:10:20.463 --> 01:10:21.796
There you are.

01:10:21.798 --> 01:10:23.231
Remember the souvenir?
Skinned face?

01:10:23.233 --> 01:10:24.732
They found it.

01:10:24.734 --> 01:10:27.003
Old man dug it up
in a dumpster this morning.

01:10:28.706 --> 01:10:31.175
Nice, right?
Wrapped up like a present.

01:10:34.979 --> 01:10:38.179
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

01:10:38.181 --> 01:10:39.714
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

01:10:39.716 --> 01:10:42.049
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

01:10:42.051 --> 01:10:46.687
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

01:10:46.689 --> 01:10:50.358
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi!

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.895
Fuck my job.

01:10:56.166 --> 01:10:57.700
Fuckin' thing.

01:10:57.702 --> 01:11:01.436
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

01:11:01.438 --> 01:11:04.004
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

01:11:04.006 --> 01:11:08.209
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

01:11:08.211 --> 01:11:11.446
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

01:11:11.448 --> 01:11:14.150
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

01:11:15.019 --> 01:11:16.817
Come on. We need
to get you out of here.

01:11:16.819 --> 01:11:17.919
It's Chucky. He's here.

01:11:22.559 --> 01:11:24.061
I gotta find my mom.

01:11:25.796 --> 01:11:27.094
Buddi! Buddi! Buddi! Buddi!

01:11:27.096 --> 01:11:28.562
Mom!

01:11:28.564 --> 01:11:30.201
Come here! Get the fuck down.

01:11:31.368 --> 01:11:32.203
Now stay down, Andy.

01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:35.702
Ten, nine, eight...

01:11:35.704 --> 01:11:37.738
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.040
- Get off of him!
- Hey! Hey!

01:11:39.042 --> 01:11:40.611
Chucky's here!
He's gonna kill you!

01:11:41.311 --> 01:11:42.777
...two, one!

01:11:44.448 --> 01:11:46.313
Be careful, goddamn it!

01:11:46.315 --> 01:11:47.782
What is going on? Mike!

01:11:47.784 --> 01:11:49.217
Look, I don't have to
tell you shit, Karen.

01:11:49.219 --> 01:11:50.619
That is my son, okay?

01:11:50.621 --> 01:11:52.086
I don't give a fuck
that it's your son.

01:11:52.088 --> 01:11:53.722
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:11:53.724 --> 01:11:55.726
<i>say hello
to your new best friend.</i>

01:11:57.461 --> 01:12:00.227
<i>The all new Buddi 2!</i>

01:12:21.585 --> 01:12:22.817
All right, come on.

01:12:22.819 --> 01:12:24.152
Watch out.
Move out of the way.

01:12:25.288 --> 01:12:26.655
- Give me your hand.
- You have to believe me.

01:12:26.657 --> 01:12:27.856
- Is that necessary?
- Mom.

01:12:27.858 --> 01:12:28.656
Yeah,
it's fucking necessary.

01:12:28.658 --> 01:12:29.958
Stay put.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.793
I promise you,
he's gonna kill us.

01:12:31.795 --> 01:12:32.759
Let me through!
Move, move, move!

01:12:32.761 --> 01:12:33.995
Clear a path, come on!

01:12:33.997 --> 01:12:35.430
Hey, hey, hey.
It's gonna be all right.

01:12:35.432 --> 01:12:37.298
Hey, look at me.
Keep pressure on it, okay?

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.000
- Somebody call a doctor!
- We have to leave right now.

01:12:39.002 --> 01:12:40.768
- Calm down. Okay?
- No, no, no! Mom...

01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:41.736
Call a doctor!

01:12:46.944 --> 01:12:48.876
Oh, shit.

01:12:48.878 --> 01:12:50.010
Mom, where are you going?

01:12:59.823 --> 01:13:01.924
<i>Hello, my name is Henry...</i>

01:13:01.926 --> 01:13:03.692
<i>My name is Henry Kaslan.</i>

01:13:03.694 --> 01:13:05.460
<i>My name is Henry Kaslan.</i>

<i>Welcome to

<i>With great pleasure,
I introduce you...</i>

<i>More than just entertainment.</i>

01:13:21.377 --> 01:13:24.912
<i>We created something
far more special.</i>

01:13:24.914 --> 01:13:27.182
<i>Every child
is important to us.</i>

01:13:27.184 --> 01:13:31.251
<i>And every child
deserves a companion.</i>

01:13:31.253 --> 01:13:33.688
<i>A friend
that will never let you down.</i>

01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:34.988
We're too late.

01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:37.759
- <i>It's time to...</i>
- <i>Play.</i>

01:13:51.908 --> 01:13:53.210
Stay down, okay?

01:13:59.417 --> 01:14:01.218
<i>Lockdown activated.</i>

01:14:02.918 --> 01:14:05.053
<i>I'm everywhere, Andy.</i>

01:14:05.055 --> 01:14:08.055
<i>You can't run away
from me now.</i>

01:14:08.057 --> 01:14:10.993
<i>See? They're all leaving you.</i>

01:14:11.394 --> 01:14:13.260
<i>But not me.</i>

01:14:13.262 --> 01:14:15.265
This way!
I know the way out!

01:14:19.101 --> 01:14:20.136
No.

01:14:26.577 --> 01:14:27.378
Fuck!

01:14:31.747 --> 01:14:32.982
Run.

01:14:38.088 --> 01:14:39.090
Andy!

01:14:47.631 --> 01:14:49.166
Holy shit!

01:14:53.737 --> 01:14:56.071
Okay. Okay! Okay.

01:14:56.073 --> 01:14:59.042
Where is Andy?

01:15:02.845 --> 01:15:05.248
Oh, God, help me!
Help me!

01:15:16.859 --> 01:15:17.927
<i>Exit now.</i>

01:15:25.635 --> 01:15:27.171
Duck!

01:15:35.545 --> 01:15:36.780
You okay?

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.714
I'm gonna follow her.

01:15:39.716 --> 01:15:40.848
Me too.

01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:41.851
Yeah.

01:15:42.853 --> 01:15:44.188
Come on.

01:15:50.194 --> 01:15:52.296
<i>Where you going, Andy?</i>

01:15:56.666 --> 01:15:57.467
Mom.

01:15:58.868 --> 01:16:02.269
Andy, he's trying
to lure us back in.

01:16:02.271 --> 01:16:04.339
I can't just leave her there.

01:16:04.341 --> 01:16:06.808
If we stay, we all die, okay?

01:16:06.810 --> 01:16:08.675
We gotta go!

01:16:08.677 --> 01:16:10.046
We'll call the cops, Andy.

01:16:12.283 --> 01:16:14.883
Okay. Okay, you're right.
Let's go.

01:16:14.885 --> 01:16:16.186
Okay. Okay, come on.

01:16:19.489 --> 01:16:20.722
Andy!

01:16:20.724 --> 01:16:22.391
It's my fault
all this happened, okay?

01:16:22.393 --> 01:16:23.290
Andy.

01:16:23.292 --> 01:16:24.893
I can't let you guys get hurt.

01:16:24.895 --> 01:16:26.363
- Andy! Come on!
- No! Andy, don't!

01:16:27.764 --> 01:16:29.296
- Andy!
- Andy!

01:16:29.298 --> 01:16:30.932
- Andy, please!
- He'll kill you, Andy!

01:16:33.203 --> 01:16:35.873
All right, Chucky,
you wanna play?

01:16:36.774 --> 01:16:38.375
Let's play.

01:16:42.578 --> 01:16:45.381
<i>Getting closer.</i>

01:17:42.572 --> 01:17:44.440
<i>Dead or alive,
you're coming with me.</i>

01:18:11.967 --> 01:18:13.535
Mom!

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.407
<i>Andy's just a bit different.</i>

01:18:20.409 --> 01:18:22.376
<i>Andy's just a bit different.</i>

01:18:22.378 --> 01:18:23.577
Shut up!

01:18:23.579 --> 01:18:24.745
<i>Don't you see?</i>

01:18:24.747 --> 01:18:26.483
<i>She's not your friend.</i>

01:18:28.185 --> 01:18:30.718
<i>You don't need other friends.</i>

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.987
<i>They try to keep us apart.</i>

01:18:32.989 --> 01:18:35.123
<i>Try to ruin our fun.</i>

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:40.393
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

01:18:40.395 --> 01:18:42.862
<i>It will be all over soon.</i>

01:18:42.864 --> 01:18:44.665
<i>Don't worry, Andy.</i>

01:18:44.667 --> 01:18:47.437
<i>You're gonna thank me
when she's gone.</i>

01:18:48.003 --> 01:18:50.341
<i>When they're all gone.</i>

01:19:04.253 --> 01:19:06.353
Guess what, Andy?

01:19:06.355 --> 01:19:09.389
Now it's going to be
you and me...

01:19:09.391 --> 01:19:11.694
...forever.

01:19:15.564 --> 01:19:18.732
I was broken, Andy.

01:19:18.734 --> 01:19:21.169
I couldn't make you smile.

01:19:21.171 --> 01:19:23.504
But I'm better now.

01:19:23.506 --> 01:19:25.406
I know how to
make you happy now.

01:19:25.408 --> 01:19:27.244
Maybe you don't
wanna be happy.

01:19:29.145 --> 01:19:31.178
Maybe you're broken too.

01:19:33.751 --> 01:19:36.485
Maybe I need to open you up,

01:19:36.487 --> 01:19:39.219
see what we're dealing with.

01:19:39.221 --> 01:19:41.690
I'm gonna fix you, Andy.

01:19:41.692 --> 01:19:46.396
<i>You are my buddy
until the end</i>

01:19:47.064 --> 01:19:48.265
What? Andy?

01:19:50.934 --> 01:19:54.137
<i>More than a buddy,
you're my best friend</i>

01:19:59.475 --> 01:20:00.476
Mom!

01:20:23.399 --> 01:20:24.665
<i>We're too late.</i>

01:20:24.667 --> 01:20:25.933
<i>We're too late.
We're too late.</i>

01:20:35.377 --> 01:20:38.745
You are ruining our fun, Andy!

01:20:38.747 --> 01:20:39.615
Get off!

01:20:41.585 --> 01:20:43.319
You're gonna play
with me now.

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.622
Only me!

01:21:09.112 --> 01:21:11.148
Andy...

01:21:12.981 --> 01:21:16.153
I thought we were friends.

01:21:28.664 --> 01:21:30.634
You are my bu...

01:21:32.002 --> 01:21:33.670
You are my bu...

01:21:35.305 --> 01:21:36.673
- Mom?
- You are my bu...

01:21:39.609 --> 01:21:42.276
<i>You are my buddy</i>

01:21:42.278 --> 01:21:43.343
<i>Until the end!</i>

01:21:51.654 --> 01:21:53.689
This is the end.

01:22:01.898 --> 01:22:05.735
Don't fuck with my son!

01:22:08.738 --> 01:22:09.706
Mom.

01:22:13.443 --> 01:22:15.677
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

01:22:15.679 --> 01:22:17.411
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:22:17.413 --> 01:22:18.614
Okay.

01:22:22.685 --> 01:22:23.720
Thank you.

01:23:13.101 --> 01:23:14.968
<i>Our
investigation has concluded</i>

01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:17.138
<i>that Kaslan
shares no responsibility</i>

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:20.942
<i>for the horrific events
that transpired at Zed Mart.</i>

01:23:20.944 --> 01:23:23.110
However, as a precaution,

01:23:23.112 --> 01:23:27.415
we are recalling all Buddi 2
products for the time being.

01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:32.152
At Kaslan,
the customers come first.

01:23:32.154 --> 01:23:35.958
<i>We believe that every child
deserves a friend for life.</i>

01:23:37.761 --> 01:23:40.697
<i>A friend who will never,
ever leave them.</i>

01:23:43.298 --> 01:23:44.264
<i>A friend...</i>

01:23:47.203 --> 01:23:49.303
<i>...till the end.</i>
