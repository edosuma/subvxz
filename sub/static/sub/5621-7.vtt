Will the Magistrate's Court

00:22.123 --> 00:23.622
Applying the queen's law
to this matter,

00:23.624 --> 00:26.792
the jury finds
Reginia Stillwell...

00:26.794 --> 00:28.961
guilty on two counts
of public tomfoolery

00:28.963 --> 00:31.803
(gallery gasping)
and one count
of brazen harlotry.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.301
Barrister Cromwell,

00:36.303 --> 00:38.971
very impressive work.
To you the same, sire.

00:38.973 --> 00:41.173
I haven't seen you
around these parts.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.875
You must have studied

00:42.877 --> 00:44.643
under Mitchard Grinder
at Cambridge.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.645
I'd recognize his tutelage
anywhere.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.981
You have a keen eye,
Barrister Heath.

00:48.983 --> 00:51.063
I did not<i> study</i>
under Mitchard Grinder...

00:54.688 --> 00:56.155
(gallery gasping)

00:56.157 --> 00:58.657
For I<i> am...</i> Mitchard Grinder.

00:58.659 --> 00:59.992
Dear God!

00:59.994 --> 01:02.661
Why here? Why now?

01:02.663 --> 01:05.164
Because I needed to escape
the shadow of myself,

01:05.166 --> 01:06.832
Barrister Heath.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.501
Because I got tired of winning
on my name alone.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.171
Because I got tired
of winning simply...

01:12.173 --> 01:14.206
because I am The Grinder.

01:14.208 --> 01:17.209
I wanted to win
because justice needed me to.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.410
Now, if you'll

01:18.412 --> 01:20.746
excuse me...

01:20.748 --> 01:23.849
I have a lorry to catch.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.385
¶ ¶

01:26.387 --> 01:29.088
(turns off TV)
"Buckingham Malice."

01:29.090 --> 01:30.556
One of my favorite episodes.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.192
It really underscored
the character's nobility.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.094
He slept with that guy's wife
while wearing his face.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.929
I think that's illegal.
Not in Europe.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.764
So he was just walking
around with a fake face on.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.200
Maybe we all walk around
with fake faces on, Stew.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.601
You should think about that.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.369
You know, Dean, just
because you walk away

01:44.371 --> 01:46.071
after you say something,
it doesn't mean

01:46.073 --> 01:46.939
you made a point.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.273
But it really does help.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.243
Maybe you should think
about that, too.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.711
Okay, that-that's
a good point.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.279
Yeah, thank you, Dad.
You walk away,

01:54.281 --> 01:56.248
and I'll just think
about both of those...

01:56.250 --> 01:58.083
both of those great points.

01:58.085 --> 02:01.286
¶ ¶

02:02.456 --> 02:04.056
STEWART:
<i>Uh...</i>

02:04.058 --> 02:05.724
one last quick thing...
I'd like to have

02:05.726 --> 02:07.426
all the week's business closed
by Friday at noon.

02:07.428 --> 02:10.062
Ooh, that's a tight
deadline. Can I ask why?

02:10.064 --> 02:12.131
He's taking Deb
up to the mountains for a, uh...

02:12.133 --> 02:13.966
What's a delicate way
to say "sex vacation"?

02:13.968 --> 02:15.934
Oh, God.
And now we don't need
the answer to that.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.936
"Intimate getaway."
Just thought of it.
Thank you, Dean.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.138
Uh, any other business?

02:19.140 --> 02:21.273
Um, who here wears socks?

02:21.275 --> 02:23.642
Because I have
a bunch of free socks.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.311
I love socks!
TODD: I wish

02:26.313 --> 02:28.113
I could wear socks.
I got this foot thing.

02:28.115 --> 02:31.150
Where'd-where'd you get all
the, all the socks, Dean?

02:31.152 --> 02:32.751
I was looking at socks
at the store, and they

02:32.753 --> 02:34.253
gave me a bunch, you know.
Just gave 'em to you?

02:34.255 --> 02:36.421
Mm-hmm.
And that seems normal to you?

02:36.423 --> 02:38.090
If you blow this for me, Stew...

02:38.092 --> 02:40.592
I'm not gonna blow a thing, Dad.
I love free socks. I...

02:40.594 --> 02:42.094
You know what? Never mind.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.263
No, I will always mind.
What are you trying to say?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.931
It's just...

02:45.933 --> 02:48.267
you keep saying
that you left this show

02:48.269 --> 02:50.769
to come back home
and live a normal life.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.938
But your life is-is not normal.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.940
Is that true, guys?

02:54.942 --> 02:56.775
You are not even
remotely normal.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.510
TODD: You don't want
to be normal, Dean.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.679
Trust me, it's horrible.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.281
You know what?
They're right, Todd.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.316
You know, I came here...

03:04.318 --> 03:07.786
to leave that all behind...

03:07.788 --> 03:09.788
and yet I haven't.

03:09.790 --> 03:10.856
From now on,

03:10.858 --> 03:12.124
no more free stuff.

03:12.126 --> 03:13.025
No more swag,

03:13.027 --> 03:14.693
no more velvet ropes,

03:14.695 --> 03:17.029
no more late-night Boggle
with Paul Giamatti.

03:17.031 --> 03:20.332
From this moment on...

03:20.334 --> 03:22.801
I'm a regular guy.

03:22.803 --> 03:23.702
I think that's good.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.037
I'm gonna...
we're gonna...

03:25.039 --> 03:26.672
Yeah. All right, thank you.
All right.

03:26.674 --> 03:27.806
Next.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.841
Please, allow me.
Uh...

03:29.843 --> 03:33.145
three lattes for Dean.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.563
You got it.

03:34.564 --> 03:35.980
STEWART: Nailed it.
DEBBIE: Yeah, you-you did great.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.816
And to think, I had
an assistant who was doing this

03:37.818 --> 03:39.318
for me every morning,
when I could've been

03:39.320 --> 03:40.986
doing it myself.
Well, Dean, you're gonna

03:40.988 --> 03:42.154
love it here...
There's lines everywhere.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.522
DEBBIE: Hey,
speaking of assistants,

03:43.524 --> 03:45.524
my new assistant is starting
today, just in time

03:45.526 --> 03:47.559
for our weekend getaway.
How long do you think
this one's gonna last?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.994
I've had some bad luck
with assistants.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.896
Three in the last year.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.031
Do you think I'm
too hard on them?
No, you're not too hard on them.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.166
You're just, you're particular.

03:54.168 --> 03:55.367
For me, I think a firm leash

03:55.369 --> 03:56.902
and a loose grip
is the way to go.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.004
I mean, it will look
really bad if I fire

03:59.006 --> 04:01.340
anybody else this year,
so loose leash it is, I guess.
No, no, no.

04:01.342 --> 04:04.209
Firm leash.
Firm leash.
Loose grip.
Hmm.

04:04.211 --> 04:07.179
DEBBIE:
<i>So, welcome. Happy first day.</i>

04:07.181 --> 04:08.580
Pretty much everything
you need to know

04:08.582 --> 04:10.682
is in that e-mail
I sent this weekend. Um,

04:10.684 --> 04:13.018
of course,
that's just a blueprint.
Okay.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.020
I'm not trying to micromanage
you or anything, so...

04:15.022 --> 04:18.557
if you think of a better way
to do something, just, you know,

04:18.559 --> 04:20.892
riff on it.
Uh-huh. Oh,
my God, is that

04:20.894 --> 04:24.062
from that truck downtown?
They make the<i> best</i> coffee.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.198
Oh, my God. I know, right?
No, I'm obsessed with it.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.701
Yeah.
Yeah. Oh, I wish I still
lived on that side of town.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.037
Well, I live
right by this place,

04:32.039 --> 04:33.572
and I go there almost every day,

04:33.574 --> 04:36.408
so why don't I bring you
a cup tomorrow?

04:36.410 --> 04:38.210
No, I couldn't ask
you to do that.
No, please,

04:38.212 --> 04:41.079
I'd be so hap...
Wow! You are the
coolest boss!

04:41.081 --> 04:43.081
That's kind of what
I was going for, so...

04:43.083 --> 04:44.783
So I would love
a triple machiato

04:44.785 --> 04:47.219
with one and a half pumps
of hazelnut, not two,

04:47.221 --> 04:49.421
and if they could do a
side cup with just the foam,

04:49.423 --> 04:51.056
that would be awesome.
Is that a thing?

04:51.058 --> 04:52.391
Do you want to write this down?

04:52.393 --> 04:54.793
Uh...
You know, actually,
I'll write it down.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.728
I'm your assistant.
I can do it.
(fake chuckle)

04:56.730 --> 04:59.431
Okay. Thanks for that.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.566
STEWART:
<i>Okay, last week you said it</i>
<i>was gonna be ready</i>

05:01.568 --> 05:04.269
on Tuesday, and on Tuesday,
you said it was gonna
be ready today,

05:04.271 --> 05:06.738
so today,
what are you saying?
Monday.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.273
Monday is not gonna work
for me, Farouk.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.409
I'm supposed to go away
with my wife this weekend.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.077
Take her car.
Her car doesn't have
snow tires.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.478
And we're going up
into the mountains.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.414
Bring it in.
I'll put snow tires on.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.149
I'm not gonna give you
both of my cars, Farouk.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.950
Bro, you're screaming now.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.152
(loudly):
I'm not...

05:20.154 --> 05:21.920
Okay, listen...

05:21.922 --> 05:24.756
we haven't been away
without the kids in a while,

05:24.758 --> 05:26.658
and I just want to take her

05:26.660 --> 05:27.793
on a kind of, um...

05:27.795 --> 05:29.594
(whispers):
A sex vacation.

05:29.596 --> 05:32.431
Yeah, it...
it's a sex vacation.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.966
Being normal has
been so enlightening.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.935
You seem so connected,
Uncle Dean.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.771
Your entire vibe has become
much more approachable.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.441
At lunch, this restaurant
wanted to seat me right away,

05:42.443 --> 05:45.944
but I said "no," and
I waited 45 minutes.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.946
Here, I took pictures.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.115
That's a guy
named Ron. Huh?

05:50.117 --> 05:52.317
How real is that?
It's almost too real.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.119
Stop sign! Stop sign!
Stop sign!

05:54.121 --> 05:55.987
Dean, that was
a stop sign!
(siren wailing)

05:55.989 --> 05:58.690
Oh, man.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.666
Sir, do you know why
we pulled you over?

06:07.668 --> 06:09.968
I kind of rolled through
that stop sign, didn't I?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.136
That's a generous
way of putting it.

06:11.138 --> 06:14.806
Get his license.
Yes, I know, Strauss.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.641
I'm gonna ask for his license.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.276
Can I see your license, please?

06:23.384 --> 06:25.317
Wait. Are... are
you The Grinder?

06:25.319 --> 06:27.319
Once upon a time.

06:27.321 --> 06:28.887
This is really embarrassing,

06:28.889 --> 06:31.156
but my wife and I have
this free pass thing

06:31.158 --> 06:33.058
where we both get
to pick a celebrity.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.528
Yeah, and I'm hers?
Um... yeah.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.197
You should, you should give him
his license back now, Collins.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.500
So are we free to go, Officer?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.503
When someone who's<i> not me</i> drives
through a stop sign,

06:44.505 --> 06:45.904
what would you do?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.506
Well, I would
give them a ticket.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.007
In that case, kind sir,

06:49.009 --> 06:51.710
I would like
one ticket.
Dean.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.678
No way. I-I can't do that.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.380
<i>The Grinder</i> is my favorite sh...

06:55.382 --> 06:58.049
my wife's favorite show.
She-she loves it.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.018
Yesterday, I would have
just kept on driving.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.686
I wouldn't even have
looked back.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.889
But now, I've made a
commitment to this man,

07:03.891 --> 07:06.057
and my word is sacred.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.393
I want the ticket.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.061
I<i> need</i> the ticket.

07:10.063 --> 07:14.099
I respect that. Okay.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.202
Write it right-right there.
Write "The Grinder."
What the heck are you doing?

07:17.204 --> 07:19.204
Is it gonna be a huge nightmare
to take care of it?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.906
Not if you just go
online and pay it.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.407
A lot of people make it
harder for themselves

07:22.409 --> 07:23.875
and try to fight it.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.110
Regular people do that?

07:25.112 --> 07:27.112
Yeah, they all of a sudden think

07:27.114 --> 07:28.914
they're lawyers, and want
to have their day in court.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.081
Oh, no.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.883
Their day in court.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.653
(chuckles)
Interesting.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.461
Good morning. In an effort
to save time, you should know

07:42.463 --> 07:44.396
my husband's a cop,
my dad's a cop.

07:44.398 --> 07:46.131
99% of the time,
I'm going to take

07:46.133 --> 07:47.732
the cop's word over yours.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.135
(gallery groaning)

07:51.605 --> 07:54.272
Well, hello.
Mr. Sanderson.

07:54.274 --> 07:57.075
My lucky day.
So, what brings you here?

07:57.077 --> 07:59.077
I believe that I was given
this ticket in error.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.080
I'm inclined to believe you,
but we still have to do this.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.448
Is the officer here?

08:03.450 --> 08:05.083
Yup. On my day off.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.752
Missing my son's
championship soccer game.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.454
Objection. Irrelevant.
ROSSMYRE:
Sustained.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.958
Can we get to it?
Yeah, uh, he blew
through the stop sign.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.093
I gave him a ticket.
Pretty cut and dry.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.763
Objection. It may have been cut,
but it certainly wasn't dry.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.932
Your Honor, I would like to call

08:20.934 --> 08:23.101
eyewitness Stewart Sanderson
to the stand.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.336
Ugh, we don't have a stand.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.670
You can just do it
from right there.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.472
Your Honor, I would like to call

08:27.474 --> 08:30.008
eyewitness Stewart Sanderson
to this general area.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.446
Your Honor.

08:34.448 --> 08:35.514
DEAN:
Mr. Sanderson,

08:35.516 --> 08:36.815
could you describe for the court

08:36.817 --> 08:38.183
what you witnessed

08:38.185 --> 08:39.684
when I was given this ticket?
STEWART:
Sure.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.119
The officer pulled you over,

08:41.121 --> 08:43.455
and when he recognized you
from<i> The Grinder,</i>

08:43.457 --> 08:44.789
he refused to give you a ticket.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.958
Then you begged him for one,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.360
'cause you're on some kick
about being a regular guy,

08:48.362 --> 08:51.029
and he ultimately obliged.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.798
He. Ultimately. Obliged.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.667
Your Honor,
this isn't about a ticket.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.802
It's even less
about running a stop sign.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.171
What this is about is justice.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.007
For all people.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.975
And wouldn't you agree,
Mr. Sanderson,

09:03.977 --> 09:07.178
that people are what make
this country great?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.814
It would be hard not to.
So for the record,
that's a "yes"?

09:09.816 --> 09:11.883
Yes.
People make this country great.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.985
Well, I think Officer Collins
would fight you on that.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.155
Apparently, he thinks
people with TV shows

09:17.157 --> 09:20.158
are more great than those
who tragically don't have them.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.660
Hmm?
Your Honor,

09:21.662 --> 09:22.827
I move to have

09:22.829 --> 09:24.162
every single ticket

09:24.164 --> 09:25.196
ever written by Officer Collins

09:25.198 --> 09:26.665
thrown into the garbage.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.667
Garbage?
Okay, well, I can't
really do all that.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.403
But how about if
I just throw out yours?
What?

09:31.405 --> 09:32.837
Great. That's perfect.

09:32.839 --> 09:33.972
For-for a start.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.009
STEWART:
<i>You said Friday, remember?</i>

09:38.011 --> 09:39.077
Farouk?

09:39.079 --> 09:40.345
Farouk?
Hey.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.746
That Armenian mechanic

09:41.748 --> 09:43.181
still jerking you around?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.250
Well, we don't know
if he's Armenian, Dad,

09:45.252 --> 09:47.018
but yes, he's still
jerking me around.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.853
Ask your brother
to help.
No.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.089
No way, Dad. That's a...
that's a non-starter for me.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.357
Besides, Dean's still on this...

09:52.359 --> 09:53.925
whatever it is,
proving that he's normal.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.894
You're the one who pushed
him into that position.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.530
I did. Yeah.
Deano! Your brother
needs a favor.

09:58.532 --> 09:59.531
You know what?
I don't, actually.

09:59.533 --> 10:00.533
I'm-I'm fine.

10:00.534 --> 10:01.900
Stop acting like a baby.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.435
Just ask the favor.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.037
Dean...

10:06.039 --> 10:07.772
Let me stop you right there.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.874
Does this favor, in any way,

10:09.876 --> 10:11.576
involve me using my celebrity
for personal gain?

10:11.578 --> 10:14.412
Yes, but...
If the answer is yes,
I'm afraid my answer is no.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.714
I'd like to help.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.916
But I've left that life behind,

10:17.918 --> 10:21.886
and I cannot imagine going back.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.788
It's been two days, Dean.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.056
The man has made a commitment.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.618
Now you're gonna
fault him for it?

10:28.929 --> 10:30.595
I'm gonna miss my trip.

10:30.597 --> 10:31.963
I'm gonna miss it.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.765
Why don't you just trick him?

10:33.767 --> 10:36.067
Trick him?

10:36.069 --> 10:38.069
How am I gonna trick him into
helping me with the mechanic?

10:38.071 --> 10:39.638
I don't know.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.072
How do I trick my dog
into going to the vet?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.474
It's easy.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.312
Huh.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.580
Morning, Deb.
Oh, morning.

10:48.582 --> 10:49.781
Hey, listen, so
I'm gonna kind of

10:49.783 --> 10:51.416
throw you into the fire today.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.251
There's 80 contacts in a shared
folder on your desktop

10:53.253 --> 10:55.086
called "Vendors." I'm gonna
need you to call them...

10:55.088 --> 10:56.955
Sorry, I'm just having
a really hard time focusing

10:56.957 --> 10:59.090
'cause I haven't had a coffee.
Is that mine?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.592
Oh. Yeah, it is.

11:00.594 --> 11:01.926
Here's your...

11:01.928 --> 11:03.762
hazelnut...
Yes.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.096
And the side of foam.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.331
Sorry about that.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.433
No, it's totally fine.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.501
So, I'm gonna need the
spreadsheets to reflect the...

11:09.503 --> 11:11.253
Ooh! (Laughs)

11:11.254 --> 11:13.004
This kind of tastes like
<i>two</i> full pumps of hazelnut.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.106
Remember, I said
a pump and a half?

11:15.108 --> 11:16.441
Yeah, I do remember.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.009
Uh, and I watched,

11:18.011 --> 11:19.144
and it's definitely
a pump and a half.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.780
This is definitely two.
Maybe even two-plus.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.648
Well, now I feel bad.

11:23.650 --> 11:24.983
It happens.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.985
How 'bout I...

11:26.987 --> 11:28.687
bring you another cup tomorrow,

11:28.689 --> 11:30.488
to make up for my...

11:30.490 --> 11:32.457
horrendous mistake?
That's really sweet.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.125
I'm just, like,
trying to figure out

11:34.127 --> 11:35.627
how I'm gonna make it
through today.

11:35.629 --> 11:36.995
'Cause of the coffee.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.663
Exactly. You get it.

11:38.665 --> 11:39.964
I do.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.332
DEBBIE:
<i>And then I ended up</i>

11:41.334 --> 11:42.634
updating all the spreadsheets.

11:42.636 --> 11:43.635
Well, hon, you
should've gotten her

11:43.637 --> 11:44.869
the right amount of pumps.

11:44.871 --> 11:45.970
I mean, she was
pretty clear about it.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.639
She's making my life
so much harder.

11:47.641 --> 11:48.973
Now I'm getting her coffee
every morning

11:48.975 --> 11:51.042
and I'm doing her work for her.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.644
And you're stressing
about it.
Yeah, I'm stressing
about it.

11:52.646 --> 11:53.978
I'm trying to get
all this work done

11:53.980 --> 11:55.046
before we leave for the weekend

11:55.048 --> 11:57.215
but I can't do my work because

11:57.217 --> 11:59.684
I'm trying to do
a good job for her?

11:59.686 --> 12:01.853
I...
She flipped it on me somehow.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.354
You gotta flip it back.
How?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.390
You have to inject a little
fear into the equation.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.691
Okay, I like this.
She's getting
a little

12:06.693 --> 12:08.159
too comfortable.
Yeah.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.994
Right?
So she's got to know

12:09.996 --> 12:11.563
that the rug can be pulled
out from her at any minute.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.864
And that you're
the one who's gonna be

12:12.866 --> 12:14.399
you know, doing the...
the pulling.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.401
Except I can't, because
I already pulled two rugs,

12:16.403 --> 12:18.002
and I'm afraid
that Dandro's gonna think

12:18.004 --> 12:19.521
that I'm the problem.

12:19.522 --> 12:21.039
You just let her know
that you<i> can</i> pull the rug.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.507
So, my hand's on the rug...
Your hand's on the rug.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.675
And I'm looking at her, yeah.

12:23.677 --> 12:25.410
That's way scarier
than a rug pull.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.911
It's the potential,
'cause you don't know

12:26.913 --> 12:28.046
when that's coming.
Mm, yeah.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.080
Then you never get comfortable.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.348
Yeah, run, go get my coffee.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.683
You can do this, Deb.

12:31.685 --> 12:32.851
You just got to flip it on her.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.252
Just like I'm gonna flip it

12:34.254 --> 12:36.221
on Farouk.
Yeah, you are.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.089
Who's Farouk?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.891
So, you sure it's not ready?

12:39.893 --> 12:42.193
I told you very clearly
on the phone, ready next week.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.362
Wow, our-our wires
must've gotten crossed, Farouk.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.364
Because my brother,
he gave me a ride.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.032
He came all the way down here.
He's in the car

12:48.034 --> 12:49.701
over there, have a look,
in the car right there.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.036
That's my brother and he
gave me a ride to the shop,

12:52.038 --> 12:54.072
because that's what
normal people do.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.573
They give each other rides
when the cars are ready.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.775
Why didn't you tell me

12:56.777 --> 12:57.876
The Grinder was your brother?

12:57.878 --> 12:58.943
Because I would never exploit my

12:58.945 --> 13:00.044
brother's celebrity in that way.

13:00.046 --> 13:00.912
How dare you suggest that!

13:00.914 --> 13:02.714
I see what's happening here.

13:02.716 --> 13:05.083
For the brother of The Grinder,
ready tomorrow.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.885
(chuckles)
Free of charge!

13:06.887 --> 13:08.953
Farouk, that's very nice.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.722
I really appreciate it.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.524
Boy, that is just so easy.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.763
ASSISTANT:
No, Bridget is out of control.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.898
No, she honestly needs

13:19.900 --> 13:21.566
to take a look in the mirror

13:21.568 --> 13:22.901
and take a step back

13:22.903 --> 13:24.903
and get back to reality.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.437
Yeah, bye.
Hey, Deb.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.072
Why are you in here?

13:28.074 --> 13:29.240
Why are you
in my office right now?

13:29.242 --> 13:31.609
It is just so loud out there.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.444
And these calls
are so important.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.079
I just don't want the vendors
thinking that they're

13:35.081 --> 13:37.649
anything less
than our first priority.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.751
Mm, wow, okay, well,
first of all,

13:39.753 --> 13:42.086
please don't talk to the vendors
about your friend Bridget.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.321
Noted.
And secondly,

13:43.323 --> 13:46.291
I'm here now, so...
(whistles)

13:46.293 --> 13:48.092
Got it. Yeah, no, I literally
have five more calls

13:48.094 --> 13:49.928
to make and then it's all yours.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.263
I feel like we need to have
a conversation about boundaries.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.766
'Okay, here's the deal.
I'm the boss.
Mm-hmm.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.434
You're the assistant.
Mm-hmm.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.936
And if you have
a problem with that,

13:57.938 --> 13:59.938
maybe this just
isn't the right fit.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.942
Hmm.
But you can't fire me, right?

14:03.944 --> 14:06.845
Well... why?

14:06.847 --> 14:08.613
You've gone through, like,
three assistants in the past

14:08.615 --> 14:11.516
six months. I mean, that'd
almost look bad on you, no?

14:13.954 --> 14:15.687
STEWART:
<i>Dean, I'm sorry.</i>

14:15.689 --> 14:16.821
I don't know what else to say.

14:16.823 --> 14:17.989
You tricked me, Stewart,

14:17.991 --> 14:20.959
like you would trick a dog
into going to the vet.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.861
Well, that-that seems...

14:22.863 --> 14:24.963
The deception you
perpetrated on me

14:24.965 --> 14:26.481
is unforgivable.

14:26.482 --> 14:27.998
So you can at least
promise me one thing.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.869
Okay.
When you're with Deb at
the cabin this weekend,

14:30.871 --> 14:32.637
you make it about her.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.973
I plan to.
'Cause if you don't,

14:34.975 --> 14:36.875
I will go ape on you.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.509
Car's all set.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.844
Oh, great, thank you.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.546
Where's, uh, where's Farouk?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.381
His appendix burst last night.
He's in the hospital.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.983
Oh, my gosh.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.885
Well, please pass on our...

14:46.887 --> 14:49.320
Not condolences.
That's... that's not right.
No.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.155
Nobody died.
That would be too much,
it's too much.

14:51.157 --> 14:54.225
Um, well, we trust you
to strike the right tone.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.965
Hey!

15:02.903 --> 15:03.868
(siren chirps)
What did I do?

15:03.870 --> 15:05.536
Are you getting
pulled over by this guy?

15:05.538 --> 15:06.871
No, I don't know,
this is unbelievable.
You didn't do anything wrong.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.073
What'd I do?
Huh.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.008
Look who it is.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.843
Hey, Officer Collins.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.344
Uh, did your son win his game?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.413
Yeah, he did actually.
Scored the winning goal.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.681
Great.
I wasn't there.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.849
But at least

15:17.851 --> 15:19.183
his stepdad got to see it.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.185
So, not a total loss.

15:21.187 --> 15:24.355
Hmm. I just got a report
that you sped off

15:24.357 --> 15:27.025
from a car repair establishment
without paying.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.092
Officer, we can explain.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.427
We had his go-ahead.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.029
Farouk said it was okay.
Had the okay.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.230
The car was supposed
to be ready on Tuesday.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.398
And then he...

15:33.400 --> 15:34.899
Free.
Did it fast for us.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.868
He said "Free," you know,
"you can take it."

15:36.870 --> 15:38.603
Step out of the car,
both of you.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.038
But first, you have to promise

15:40.040 --> 15:41.239
that what I said
about you in court

15:41.241 --> 15:42.607
won't influence
how you treat us today.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.609
Out of the car.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.776
He's not promising.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.616
Yeah, all right, great.
Thank you.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.384
Couldn't get in touch with Dad.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.953
But I left a message
with our assistant.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.054
Well, while you were wasting

15:56.056 --> 15:57.055
your time with that,
I got it solved.

15:57.057 --> 15:57.956
You got in touch with Farouk?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.223
Not exactly, but Todd's

15:59.225 --> 16:00.225
on his way to hospital.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.392
Todd?

16:01.394 --> 16:02.393
Of everyone in the office,

16:02.395 --> 16:03.561
you got in touch with Todd?

16:03.563 --> 16:04.729
Who would you have me call?

16:04.731 --> 16:05.964
I don't know... Dad, Claire,

16:05.966 --> 16:07.432
the receptionist, Ethan?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.900
Do you want results?

16:08.902 --> 16:10.134
Because I don't know anyone

16:10.136 --> 16:11.769
who's more due for a win
than Todd.

16:11.771 --> 16:12.904
Hello.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.138
I'm Todd Volcheck

16:14.140 --> 16:16.074
from Sanderson & Yao.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.742
And is this the room of, uh,

16:17.744 --> 16:20.945
Farouk... oh, uh, God,
I'm gonna butcher this...

16:20.947 --> 16:22.981
Uh, Ma-ha...

16:22.983 --> 16:26.751
da... na-danian?

16:26.753 --> 16:31.155
Farouk Manda... danian?

16:33.293 --> 16:36.294
(whispering):
I can't believe that guy just
defecated in front of us.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.929
It's a power play,

16:37.931 --> 16:40.098
plain and simple, and it worked.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.833
You know, we wouldn't be
in this position

16:41.835 --> 16:43.334
had you not deceived me.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.602
That cop would've let us go

16:44.604 --> 16:45.970
if you hadn't humiliated
him in court.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.606
You know we're gonna be here all
night now? My trip is ruined.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.807
Maybe I'm just not built

16:49.809 --> 16:50.942
for regular life.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.276
No, Dean.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.945
Maybe I was too hard on you.

16:53.947 --> 16:55.947
Maybe you should just
accept who you are.

16:55.949 --> 16:58.549
God, you teach me so much.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.954
You know what?

17:02.956 --> 17:06.290
I think you taught me
a few things, too.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.126
Excuse me?

17:08.128 --> 17:09.128
Hello?

17:09.129 --> 17:09.961
Yes, Officer?

17:09.963 --> 17:11.529
Do you recognize this man?

17:11.531 --> 17:12.864
Sure, he's The Grinder.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.466
My celebrity free pass!
Thank you.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.168
So you're aware that when
he gets out tomorrow,

17:17.170 --> 17:19.303
this place is gonna be
crawling with reporters.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.039
Yeah?

17:21.041 --> 17:22.173
But you're not
gonna be the guard

17:22.175 --> 17:23.674
standing next to him
in those photos, are you?

17:23.676 --> 17:24.809
It'd be the morning shift guy.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.477
It'll be the morning shift guy.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.979
Officer,

17:27.981 --> 17:30.648
do you really want
the morning shift guy

17:30.650 --> 17:33.985
to be the one on the news taking
the cuffs off of The Grinder?

17:33.987 --> 17:35.653
Or do you want a story
that you can tell people

17:35.655 --> 17:38.222
for the rest of your life?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.026
(woman shouts indistinctly)

17:42.028 --> 17:43.394
REPORTER:
Grinder, over here!
Grinder!

17:43.396 --> 17:45.063
REPORTER 2:
What was it like
in the big house?

17:45.065 --> 17:46.030
Over here, Grinder!

17:46.032 --> 17:47.732
(crowd cheering, clamoring)

17:54.040 --> 17:56.674
Stop.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.077
This just doesn't feel right.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.511
Dean, trust me, this is right.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.680
When this used to happen
to me on the show,

18:02.682 --> 18:04.415
I would gather
the creative team,

18:04.417 --> 18:06.050
and I would sit them down
and tell them,

18:06.052 --> 18:08.086
"We have lost the thread.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.687
"We need to get back

18:09.689 --> 18:11.522
to The Grinder's
one core principle."

18:11.524 --> 18:12.857
And what was that exactly?

18:12.859 --> 18:15.026
What makes The Grinder
The Grinder

18:15.028 --> 18:18.563
is that he never gets by
on just being The Grinder.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.198
He proves it.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.366
Every second of every day

18:22.368 --> 18:24.535
with every decision.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.937
Absolute integrity.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.272
Well, that's a
lot of pressure.
I know.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.108
That's why he did
heroin that one time.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.909
I thought he didn't know
he was doing heroin.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.544
I think he knew.
What are you saying?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.446
I'm going back in there.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.581
Wha...? Why?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.716
Because, Stew,
I gave our cellmates

18:38.718 --> 18:40.885
a story that they will tell
for the rest of their lives

18:40.887 --> 18:42.386
about an actor

18:42.388 --> 18:44.088
who defends the law
on television,

18:44.090 --> 18:47.258
but thinks he's
above it in real life.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.726
I'm gonna rewrite that story.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.094
Show that we're all the same.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.396
It's actually pretty noble.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.232
Yeah, I know.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.400
Well, I'll be here for
you when you get out.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.935
Actually, I won't.
I'll still be at the cabin.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.637
But, um, like, Monday.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.808
Write to me.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.170
Dean, you're gonna be out
way before a letter gets here.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.913
It's, like, overnight, Dean.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.282
We're good?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.284
A smuggled cell phone
could be helpful.

19:13.286 --> 19:16.053
I-I don't know how I would
smuggle a cell phone in to you.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.258
Never stop fighting!

19:20.260 --> 19:22.827
(crowd cheering)

19:22.829 --> 19:23.961
Stop fighting what?

19:23.963 --> 19:25.329
I have no idea.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.936
Hey!
You all set?
I got the car.

19:31.938 --> 19:32.937
So you flipped it on Farouk?

19:32.939 --> 19:34.305
Yeah, totally flipped it.
How about you?

19:34.307 --> 19:35.973
How was your flip thing
with, uh, what's her name?

19:35.975 --> 19:37.842
Yeah, yeah, great.
I flipped her good.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.011
Nice.
And then she
flipped it right back.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.846
What, Deb?
I know, honey, I'm sorry.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.447
But, look, we're gonna make it,
I promise.

19:43.449 --> 19:46.117
Why are you so late?
You didn't get my message?

19:46.119 --> 19:48.119
From jail? I was in jail.
What? Who was in jail?

19:48.121 --> 19:50.688
I was. I called you.
ASSISTANT:
Are you taking off right now?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.023
'Cause if you're taking off,
I think I'm gonna take off, too.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.624
Laura?

19:53.626 --> 19:55.459
Did my husband call
by any chance?

19:55.461 --> 19:57.028
From jail?

19:57.030 --> 19:59.130
Oh, yes.

19:59.132 --> 20:02.133
Deb, your husband
called from jail.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.635
So, my husband called from jail,

20:04.637 --> 20:06.137
and you forgot to tell me?

20:06.139 --> 20:07.672
Ooh, sorry about that.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.140
It won't happen again.
(laughs)

20:09.142 --> 20:12.009
(clears throat)

20:12.011 --> 20:14.478
You know what?
I think I am gonna take off.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.347
Great, 'cause I think I'm
actually gonna take off, too.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.015
Oh, my God, you totally should.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.483
But before you do that,
you should grab all the crap

20:19.485 --> 20:20.985
out of your desk
and take it with you.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.820
And then on Monday when
you wake up and you think,

20:22.822 --> 20:23.988
"Oh, my God,
I should go to work,"

20:23.990 --> 20:25.022
you shouldn't come.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.224
Wait, what?

20:26.226 --> 20:27.658
I'm pulling the rug, Laura,

20:27.660 --> 20:28.993
right out from under you.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.162
You got rug-pulled.

20:31.164 --> 20:32.396
I'm Stewart, by the way.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.497
I'm Deb's husband.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.532
Oh, hey, Laura,
nice to meet you.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.200
Yeah, we spoke on the phone.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.402
That's right.
Right.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.077
Uncle Dean!

20:47.680 --> 20:49.046
Are you okay?
Yeah.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.348
You all right?

20:50.350 --> 20:51.382
Yeah.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.917
I'm fine.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.052
In spite of having
to do things I never thought

20:55.054 --> 20:56.420
I'd have to do
to survive in there.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.389
Uh-oh.
Like eat processed food.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.423
Oh.
So,

20:59.425 --> 21:00.858
I say we go
to a nice restaurant,

21:00.860 --> 21:02.693
and in all likelihood,
get a free meal.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.228
I love it!
Yeah!

21:04.230 --> 21:05.696
I thought you weren't
taking any more freebies.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.698
You know, Lizzie,

21:06.699 --> 21:08.032
I learned some things in there.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.867
Much like Martin Luther King

21:09.869 --> 21:11.369
when he was jailed.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.404
I learned that fame
is not just a privilege.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.772
It's a responsibility.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.040
And I owe it to the people

21:16.042 --> 21:17.441
who made me famous

21:17.443 --> 21:19.110
to remain famous.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.278
Wow.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.879
I'm even more proud of you now

21:21.881 --> 21:24.949
than when you made
that opposite choice yesterday.

21:24.951 --> 21:29.687
Yeah, me, too, Ethan.
Me, too.
