WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:07.674
PEACEMAKER: I'm gonna be honest
about something here.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.343
Homunculi freak me the fuck out.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.470
-Homunculi?
-Yeah.

00:12.554 --> 00:16.141
It's plural for homunculus.
It's a tiny miniature person.

00:16.224 --> 00:16.933
Yeah, I don't like
what they're up to.

00:17.016 --> 00:19.436
I don't like
what they fuckin' do.

00:19.519 --> 00:20.353
Hey, Doll Man,
you ever meet him?

00:20.437 --> 00:23.106
-LEOTA ADEBAYO: Doll Man?
-He turns small.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.649
LEOTA: He calls
himself Doll Man?

00:24.733 --> 00:26.943
Yeah. Barrett M82?

00:27.026 --> 00:27.944
-Yep.
-Nice.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.487
You ever seen
a one-millimeter finger?

00:29.571 --> 00:31.740
Gives me the heebie-jeebies.
(SHUDDERS)

00:31.823 --> 00:33.867
Nobody told me I had to
deal with fuckin' homunculi.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.785
LEOTA: Well, who's saying
you gotta deal with them now?

00:35.869 --> 00:37.454
You kidding me?
I found a miniature spaceship

00:37.537 --> 00:38.455
in the apartment of the chick
I had sex with.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.331
You guys know.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.958
The one who was really
into having sex with me,

00:42.041 --> 00:43.960
-she came like, four times?
-We know who she is.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.463
We don't need to know how much
she enjoyed having sex with you.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.256
-What if it's a clue?
-It's not.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.133
Fair. I was just trying
to slip it into conversation.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.551
Hope nobody noticed. My bad.

00:52.343 --> 00:52.927
Still, fuckin' hate homunculi.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.472
Where's this tiny spaceship now?

00:55.555 --> 00:56.097
Adebayo's desk, under my lunch.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.142
-John.
-Oh, fuck.

00:59.225 --> 01:03.104
Hey, I want it back when
you're done with it, Dye-Beard!

01:03.188 --> 01:05.982
Oh, shit. Is Project Butterfly
homunculi that team up

01:06.065 --> 01:07.776
with hard-bodied sluts
that wanna control us?

01:07.859 --> 01:09.944
No, but who's the guy
that's peeking out

01:10.028 --> 01:11.029
behind the trashcan?

01:12.906 --> 01:15.867
Fuck, it's-- it's Vigilante.
He's trying to be helpful.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.369
Hey! Get outta here!

01:18.453 --> 01:21.206
What? I'm just looking
from behind a trashcan.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.458
-It's a normal thing to do.
-The hell it is!

01:23.541 --> 01:25.251
VIGILANTE: Are you
a psychiatrist?

01:25.335 --> 01:27.629
-EMILIA HARCOURT: What?
-VIGILANTE: Then don't tell me
what's normal!

01:27.712 --> 01:29.714
Maybe my secret identity
is a psychiatrist

01:29.798 --> 01:31.341
and I know what's normal.

01:31.424 --> 01:32.801
If you're a psychiatrist,
we're all screwed.

01:32.884 --> 01:36.137
Get the fuck out of here!

01:36.221 --> 01:38.181
VIGILANTE: I was about to go,
and then you had to say that.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.725
Now if I acquiesce,
I'll look and feel small.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.520
Vij, bro, come on. Be cool.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.146
VIGILANTE: I just wanna
make sure you're okay.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.606
-I don't trust these people.
-I'm fine.

01:46.689 --> 01:50.443
VIGILANTE: Just remember,
even if they end up being okay
to "work with,"

01:50.527 --> 01:52.070
they're still not gonna be
good friends.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.905
(LOUDLY) And none of them is
the type to be a best friend!

01:53.988 --> 01:56.032
-(SCOFFS)
-PEACEMAKER: Okay.

01:56.115 --> 02:00.495
(CHUCKLES) I'm just chuckling
even thinking about it.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.205
-Okay, bro.
-VIGILANTE: If one of them

02:02.288 --> 02:04.040
does become a friend,
it should be her,

02:04.123 --> 02:05.041
because there's a bunch
of rumors going around

02:05.124 --> 02:07.836
about you being racist,
and, you know,

02:07.919 --> 02:08.920
-frankly, it's a little
embarrassing for me.
-(SCOFFS)

02:09.003 --> 02:12.006
As if I become
a racist by osmosis,

02:12.090 --> 02:14.300
even though I mostly
kill white people, so...

02:14.926 --> 02:15.260
Catch you guys later.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.305
Isn't that guy wanted
on multiple counts of murder?

02:19.389 --> 02:22.058
We have bigger fish to fry.
We have a United States Senator

02:22.141 --> 02:24.394

of the day.

CLEMSON MURN: Our target
is Senator Royland Goff.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.260
He's mostly known
for being a radical proponent

04:21.344 --> 04:22.512
of climate change.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.472
Okay, so we're gonna kill him
'cause climate change is a hoax?

04:24.555 --> 04:26.516
Why do all people
that think pro wrestling is real

04:26.599 --> 04:28.184
think climate change
is a hoax?

04:28.267 --> 04:31.020
-It's not a hoax.
-(SCOFFS) Yeah, okay.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.939
Facebook's lying to me every day
for no reason.

04:33.022 --> 04:36.025
Senator Goff is a butterfly,
and we need to take him out.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.027
Next photo.

-PEACEMAKER: Look at this!

04:42.407 --> 04:44.409
-(HARCOURT LAUGHING)
-Shit. I'm so sorry.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.452
-My wife sent it to me.
-Your wife? Holy shit!

04:46.536 --> 04:48.162
Yes, my wife.
Fuck, I'm so sorry...

04:48.246 --> 04:49.163
I had no idea
Adebayo here was playing

04:49.247 --> 04:51.582
for the Washington
Lickalotapusses!

04:51.666 --> 04:52.709
Did you, Murn? Did you--

04:52.792 --> 04:54.252
Well, I didn't know
that you was playing for the,

04:54.335 --> 04:55.294
I don't know, the fuckin'
Milwaukee Roided-Up

04:55.378 --> 04:57.964
-Toilet Bowl Hats!
-I'm not from Milwaukee!

04:58.047 --> 04:59.882
Well, I'm so sorry, sir.
She just moved
to a different hotel

04:59.966 --> 05:02.051
because Harcourt said
that it would be dangerous
if we stayed in the same suite.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.386
-Oh, shit!
-HARCOURT: Oh, okay.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.555
-She just threw you
under the bus!
-So this is my fault now?

05:05.638 --> 05:07.890
No, it's just now Keeya thinks
I chose this job over her.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.392
And we're experimenting
with new forms of intimacy.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.394
And I didn't know that WhatsApp
would just automatically

05:11.477 --> 05:12.895
-put this onto the device.
-You're... (LAUGHS)

05:12.979 --> 05:14.063
Yeah, WhatsApp will do that

05:14.147 --> 05:16.065
if you don't change
the settings.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.859
-Nobody told me!
-Yeah, no shit.

05:17.942 --> 05:18.860
-(LAUGHS)
-It's not that fuckin' funny!

05:18.943 --> 05:20.028
-It is.
-Dick.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.739
-Just continue, Leota.
-Yes, sir.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.490
PEACEMAKER: (EXHALING) Whoo!

05:24.574 --> 05:26.367
Goff may be traveling
with his family.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.994
(LAUGHING)
That is a weird segue.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.537
We don't know yet whether or not

05:29.620 --> 05:31.873
his wife and children
are butterflies. If so...

05:31.956 --> 05:33.458
you'll have to kill all of 'em.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.418
What?

05:35.501 --> 05:37.378
I thought you loved peace
with all your heart,

05:37.462 --> 05:38.963
no matter how many men,
women, and children

05:39.047 --> 05:40.298
you needed to kill to get it?

05:41.799 --> 05:43.259
Yes, I said that. I say that.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.594
And I-- I mean it. It's--

05:44.677 --> 05:45.386
Like, that's the vow I took,
but...

05:47.346 --> 05:48.556
Kids?

05:48.639 --> 05:49.557
Well, we aren't sure yet
if they're butterflies.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.100
Okay, easy. This is the part
where you tell me

05:51.184 --> 05:53.144
what the fuck a butterfly is.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.937
We're not here
to answer your questions, Smith.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.273
So what is it,
"Just trust us and shoot kids"?

05:57.356 --> 05:59.776
Come on, man,
look how adorable that one is.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.277
The other one, not so much.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.279
He's got like a Children
of the Corn vibe going on.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.281
Are you sure those two kids
came out of those parents?

06:05.364 --> 06:07.658
That's an attractive couple,
and that one looks
like it came out of them,

06:07.742 --> 06:10.078
-but the other one looks
like a butt baby.
-A "butt baby"?

06:10.161 --> 06:11.454
Yeah, my older brother told me
there's two types of babies.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.457
One that comes out
of a woman's vagina, normal,

06:14.540 --> 06:16.334
and then butt babies,
worse in every way.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.335
They come out of a woman's butt.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.796
You know, I believed
I was a butt baby

06:19.879 --> 06:21.964
-until I was like, 14.
-That explains a lot.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.299
What does this have
to do with anything?

06:23.382 --> 06:24.967
Just because that's
an unattractive child

06:25.051 --> 06:27.178
-doesn't mean I wanna kill it.
-Your feelings are noted.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.309
This is Goff's bodyguard,
goes by the name of Judomaster.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.061
(SCOFFS) The fuck's
that guy gonna protect him from,

06:35.144 --> 06:37.230
-pink hearts and green clovers?
-We understand he's dangerous.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.482
He-- he's two feet tall!

06:39.565 --> 06:41.526
We'll be on site
in about ten minutes.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.319
Peacemaker and Harcourt
will take out Goff,

06:43.402 --> 06:45.321
while Leota, John,
and I work remotely.

06:45.404 --> 06:47.323
Don't terminate the kids
or the wife

06:47.406 --> 06:48.658
until we tell you it's okay.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.535
-Any questions?
-PEACEMAKER: Yes.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.954
Is scissoring real? I keep
getting contradictory reports.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.164
I suspected you were a butt baby
from the beginning.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.167
PEACEMAKER: Oh, I'm all for it.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.419
One thing I'm in favor of,
it's two chicks going at it.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.504
-Oh, geez.
-What? I'm a fuckin' ally.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.799
Having a lesbian haircut
doesn't make you an ally.

07:04.882 --> 07:07.635
You haven't seen my porn folder,
400 gigs of alliance.

07:08.469 --> 07:11.764
Hey, uh,
where's the dove of peace?

07:11.848 --> 07:13.516
-The what?
-The dove of peace,

07:13.599 --> 07:14.976
my trademark.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.353
It's engraved on all my weapons,
my tomahawk, my sword,

07:17.436 --> 07:18.855
my blowdarts, my pistol!

07:18.938 --> 07:21.190
You wanted us to stop
and take the sniper rifle

07:21.274 --> 07:23.192
to an engraver
and put a dove of peace on it?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.987
Uh, yeah! This is fucked up!

07:27.280 --> 07:29.782
I don't think I can kill someone
with something that doesn't have

07:29.866 --> 07:30.908
the dove of peace on it.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.039
Fuck. Every time I draw
a dove of peace,

07:37.123 --> 07:37.373
it looks like a ghost.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.517
Fuck!

07:56.601 --> 07:59.228
So, why don't you just tell him
what butterflies are?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.105
I don't trust him. Do you?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.065
I guess not.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.612
We need Peacemaker
to stop questioning us.

08:07.695 --> 08:10.406
He's stubborn, but he also
has a deep need to belong.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.033
We can use that
to our advantage.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.452
-Cool.
-Toss me a screw.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.957
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

08:20.041 --> 08:21.083
So, uh...

08:22.668 --> 08:27.548
they say you've done, like,
some real hardcore shit.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.926
I'm trying to do what I can
to make up for my past.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.469
(DRILL WHIRRING)

08:33.179 --> 08:34.430
Things I've done make me...

08:36.933 --> 08:37.892
sad.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.436
There.
