Date is November 11th, 1983.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.593
Interview with John Rayburn.

01:33.011 --> 01:34.846
And what happened?

01:35.847 --> 01:37.849
He was hit by a car.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.354
[Potts]
So then you helped him up.

01:43.688 --> 01:45.731
Brought him inside the house?

[young John]
Yes, sir.

01:49.652 --> 01:51.236

Okay.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.073
Will you send in your brother?

Yes, sir.

So you lied to the police.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.445
Yeah.

03:14.904 --> 03:17.740
That was 30 years ago.
How old were you, 14?

03:18.741 --> 03:20.785
I still knew it was wrong.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.749
All these years,
you guys never spoke about it?

03:27.083 --> 03:28.876
Not till yesterday.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.337
How did that go?

03:33.089 --> 03:34.173
I apologized.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.051
And?

03:37.802 --> 03:40.262
I think he was all right with it.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.309
What?

03:48.771 --> 03:51.732
It could have just as easily
been me on that boat with Sarah.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.368
I'm glad that you guys finally
had a chance to talk about this.

04:13.212 --> 04:14.922
I feel like things can be better now.

You've made a real commitment
here, Danny. I'm proud of you.

04:47.705 --> 04:48.956
Mm.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.877
I talked to Gwen about a raise.

He cut me out of his will.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.546
Of course he fucking did.

He offered me a chunk
of change to leave, though.

07:05.176 --> 07:06.218
Why didn't you take it?

07:06.385 --> 07:08.428
Because he fucking died

to keep quiet, do our job.

- Exactly what we're gonna do.
- Eric, there's an opportunity here.

07:43.381 --> 07:46.925
- Something at the end of those gas cans.
- We got a good thing here.

You can answer.

I don't know,
probably six or seven beers.

came out of the restroom?

threw him down and pulled a knife.

- Clear as day.
- Okay.

09:51.883 --> 09:55.220
Well, then, I'm just wondering
what hand he might have had a knife in.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.931
Uh...

09:58.015 --> 09:59.099
His right hand.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.436
And then?

10:02.894 --> 10:05.647
Then he said he wanted his money,
or he'd cut up the victim.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.774
So the victim gave him what he had.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.528
Did you see Mr. Mejia use the knife?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.488
No, he just grabbed the cash and ran.

- And you called the police.
- Yeah.

from that night

10:22.998 --> 10:25.250

another call as well.

- Who'd you call?

10:30.255 --> 10:32.383

- Oh, did the victim give you her number?

10:35.927 --> 10:37.388
No.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.225
Then how exactly did you know
where to reach her?

in that whole fucking family.

- Nothing.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.179
Nothing?

11:19.388 --> 11:21.098
No, he's not gonna find out, right?

11:21.306 --> 11:22.641
I don't care if he finds out.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.269
That's my best friend
we're talking about, you know?

11:25.477 --> 11:28.439
Your best friend made it clear that
he wants nothing to do with me.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.691
So save your fucking
lectures for someone else.

for your own place, too?

Certainly is a prime piece of waterfront.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.580
Yeah. Could more than double
my business.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.832
You'd have to make improvements
on the existing structure.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.126
That won't be cheap.

11:49.334 --> 11:53.046
Yeah, but see, I thought I could use
the loan for that as well, right?

11:53.255 --> 11:56.467
And then, I'll use my place as collateral.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.595
The bank will need
to assess your property

11:59.803 --> 12:01.972
and the business before
I can give my approval.

I can't do it all today. It's a process.

- Born and raised in Big Pine.

- because I care.
- I can see that.

Those other guys who wanna
buy that property, they don't care.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.589
I'll send out the assessor,

12:35.714 --> 12:37.716
- and we'll get things rolling.
- Fantastic.

Ray?

You get your traffic on the ones.

Listen to me, you asshole.

I don't know who you fucked
over to get out of jail,

13:59.381 --> 14:01.800
but I'll end your fucking
probation now. Understand?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.511
You got a weapon in there?
I'll send you back.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.264
You got weed in there,
I'll fucking send you back.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.349
- Do you understand me?
- Jesus fuck--

14:09.558 --> 14:12.811
Ray. These girls were killed
on their way into the country.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.104
Recognize them?

14:16.064 --> 14:17.941
- You recognize them?
- I'm out of that.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.694
My crew's still in prison.
I ain't planning on going back.

14:20.778 --> 14:21.986
[Marco]
Anybody recruit you

14:22.070 --> 14:23.154
- when you got out?
- No.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.365
Who took over after
your ring was busted up?

14:25.574 --> 14:28.076
I'm sure someone did, but they ain't
come knock on my door.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.745
[John]
Don't raise your voice, Ray.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.079
Why don't you try a farm?

14:32.038 --> 14:34.082
Farm-- You know,
this attitude that you got,

14:34.291 --> 14:36.042
- it's not helping--
- No, farm.

14:36.251 --> 14:37.544
Fucking orchards.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.921
You know, fruits and guavas
and shit like that.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.923
They always need spics over there.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.759
Spic?

14:44.301 --> 14:46.177
No offense.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.847
That's the least offensive
thing about you, Ray.

14:49.848 --> 14:53.101
- Most of them hire illegals.
- Who's the biggest fucking employer?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.604
We brought them to five or six.

14:55.813 --> 14:57.981
I asked you who's the biggest one, Ray.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.233
Bezler, I guess.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.278
Bezler Farms. Bezler Orchards.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.656
You ever end up torching
one of your own boats?

15:05.739 --> 15:07.157
- No. Never.
- [John] No?

15:07.365 --> 15:09.993
- You sure?
- Look, I gave you what you want.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.454

Seventy-two, '73?

30:33.916 --> 30:37.878
- [Bezler] 1970. First truck I ever owned.
- [Marco] Beautiful.

30:38.087 --> 30:41.006
My grandfather had
a baby blue '66 C10 with whitewalls.

30:41.215 --> 30:42.633
He called her Camilla. He loved her.

30:42.717 --> 30:45.219

Why don't you take a look inside?

30:45.428 --> 30:47.346

- Oh, yeah.

30:56.313 --> 30:58.107
As knowledgeable
as you are, detective,

30:58.274 --> 31:01.778
I'm sure you didn't drive out here
to discuss the virtues of the automobile.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.572
No. We came here
to talk to your employees.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.700
[laughs]
I'm afraid that just isn't possible.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.159
Well, why is that?

31:09.326 --> 31:10.745
This is private property.

31:10.828 --> 31:13.456
If you don't have a warrant,
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

31:13.623 --> 31:16.333
Sorry. We're not here
to investigate your hiring practices.

31:16.500 --> 31:19.837
- We can get a search warrant if you want.
- Yeah, not a problem.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.299
If we do that, might as well
invite all the guys here too.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.135
Yeah, he plays softball
with some guys from INS.

31:26.719 --> 31:29.221
Can't hit for shit,
but they are sticklers for detail--

31:29.305 --> 31:32.391
Maybe that wouldn't be a good idea.
They're gonna seize your books

31:32.475 --> 31:34.393
and scour through
your employment records.

31:34.602 --> 31:37.104
All of my employees
provide paperwork.

31:37.313 --> 31:40.357
Oh, I'm sure they do.
And I'm sure some of it's even legit.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.067
John, you know, I envy your guys.

31:42.276 --> 31:46.155
They're gonna come here and
they're gonna have a fucking field day.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.115
[John]
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.910

"The good neighbor."

33:21.208 --> 33:23.920
I think it means
someone's trying to help us.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.927
[Kevin]
No, we'll get it done by 8.

33:31.385 --> 33:32.803
Okay, thanks a lot.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.513
- Hey.
- Hi.

33:34.722 --> 33:37.015
- Just came from the bank.
- Yeah? How's it look?

33:37.224 --> 33:39.476
Property's been assessed.
Everything is in order.

33:39.685 --> 33:43.230
You have to be sure Belle doesn't file
for divorce before that comes through.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.441
- Okay.
- She could torpedo the whole thing.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.861
- Okay. Hey, thanks for doing this.
- Yeah.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.447
I actually wouldn't advise you
going through with it,

33:51.614 --> 33:53.490
but you're so determined.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.367
It's a lot of money, I know, I know.

33:55.576 --> 33:58.996
But, frankly, I don't have another option.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.498
I'm barely keeping
my head above water here.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.000
So you take on debt?

34:03.208 --> 34:06.754
Listen, if I get the property,
I can expand, you know?

34:06.963 --> 34:08.422
I'll-- I'll pay it back.

34:08.631 --> 34:10.883
Well, you better.
Or they're gonna own the place.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.802
I know how it works, Meg. Okay?

34:13.010 --> 34:14.470
All right.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.808
Hey, did you think about
that other thing?

34:19.016 --> 34:20.643
Cutting Danny back in?

34:21.727 --> 34:23.479
Did you?

34:24.021 --> 34:26.231
I just want us all
to be on the same page.

34:29.151 --> 34:31.111
Well, I don't wanna
stand in anybody's way.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.197
If it's okay with you guys,
it's okay with me.

34:37.618 --> 34:39.662
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.706
I mean, you know,
he's made mistakes, but--

34:42.915 --> 34:45.542
I mean, we've all done things
we're not proud of.

34:46.836 --> 34:48.671
But listen, maybe it's all for the best.

34:48.879 --> 34:51.841
He'll feel included.
He won't flake out again.

34:54.468 --> 34:56.136
All right. Good.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.681
I will draw up all the paperwork.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.308
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later?

35:13.320 --> 35:16.073
[Kevin]
Look at all of this shit.

35:19.910 --> 35:24.122
My God, I have not seen the inside
of Dad's shed since I was a little kid.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.959
The man was very particular
about who he let in.

35:27.043 --> 35:28.126
[Kevin chuckles]

35:29.545 --> 35:32.048
- You want something?
- Yeah, actually... Uh...

35:32.255 --> 35:35.342
I've been meaning to
talk to you about something, uh...

35:37.135 --> 35:41.015
The other night, I kind of hooked up with
somebody that I probably shouldn't have.

35:41.223 --> 35:44.101
Hm. Why are you telling me?

35:44.309 --> 35:46.520
Uh, it was Chelsea.

35:48.564 --> 35:50.566
Yeah, I saw her at this bar.

35:50.774 --> 35:54.194
I was out of my mind.
She was wasted.

35:54.403 --> 35:56.072
It was just so stupid.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.949
And one thing led to another. It was...

35:59.909 --> 36:01.410
It was a total dickhead move

36:01.618 --> 36:06.248
and if you're pissed off,
I completely understand.

36:08.751 --> 36:10.377
Because it just dawned on me later,

36:10.586 --> 36:14.214
maybe that you guys had
sort of something going on.

36:14.423 --> 36:18.135
- In which case, Danny-- Okay.
- Kevin, I said it's fine.

36:21.638 --> 36:25.308
I don't think I said anything,
but Belle and I are breaking up.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.937
- Shit.
- Yep.

Got a lawyer and everything.

It's been a pretty rough time.

And now I'm this age
and I am single again.

36:42.451 --> 36:45.871
It's... It's a horrible feeling.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.415
Yeah. Yeah, I bet.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.167
It's the worst.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.798
So no hard feelings? We're good?

36:58.300 --> 37:00.136
- No hard feelings.
- Yeah?

37:02.179 --> 37:05.515
Okay. Thanks.

- Tom's Harbor? I don't know.

Whatever fucking docks
they unload their shit at.

Well, unfortunately
it was an anonymous tip.
