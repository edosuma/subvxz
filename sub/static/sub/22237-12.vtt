WEBVTT

00:00.429 --> 00:03.256
You cast a spell to get me magic
and you got stuck there.

00:03.277 --> 00:05.391
It would be different this time -
I know how how to do it.

00:05.411 --> 00:07.527
What is this place?
And how do I get out of here?

00:07.548 --> 00:09.226
This is your home now, Andy.

00:09.247 --> 00:10.970
You swapped us!

00:10.991 --> 00:13.199
- Do not open your mouth.
- Too late.

00:14.584 --> 00:17.390
The lines on the talisman - they're
the same pattern as the ley lines.

00:17.411 --> 00:18.425
That's the school!

00:18.446 --> 00:20.780
- What are we looking for?
- Another talisman.

00:20.912 --> 00:23.480
Sp we could swap back to our
old bodies with that thing?

00:23.836 --> 00:25.004
I'm me!

00:25.025 --> 00:29.371
- Think we can use this to talk to Andy?
- We might be able to bring him home...

Season 2, Episode 12

01:16.742 --> 01:19.742
Synced by Reef

01:21.859 --> 01:23.385
Hey...

01:23.625 --> 01:27.447
- This looks better on you.
- You bet it does.

01:30.785 --> 01:32.451
We don't have time for this.

01:33.241 --> 01:34.460
Felix!

01:34.503 --> 01:37.720
- We need to contact Andy, right?
- But we have the talisman, so...

01:37.741 --> 01:41.031
And the ley lines magnify magical power,
especially where they intersect.

01:41.052 --> 01:43.074
- Like at the altar in the forest.
- And this one.

01:43.095 --> 01:45.382
So we use the altar to boost
the communication spell,

01:45.403 --> 01:47.838
and find a spell that
turns a window into a door.

01:47.859 --> 01:51.187
- That's brilliant.
- Just have to find one first.

01:51.353 --> 01:55.110
- Do you know what they're saying?
- They lost me at 'ley lines.'

02:20.331 --> 02:21.913
Felix...?

02:22.196 --> 02:24.741
These books have more spells
than I've ever seen before.

02:24.762 --> 02:26.123
Felix!

02:30.580 --> 02:32.192
Ice...

02:33.543 --> 02:35.036
The talisman!

02:35.572 --> 02:37.737
- What does that mean?
- Nothing good.

02:39.706 --> 02:42.392
- Do you guys feel that?
- It's freezing!

02:42.413 --> 02:45.309
- The air conditioning.
- Magic.

02:45.330 --> 02:47.035
Elemental magic.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.456
- Alice knows about the second talisman.
- What's she doing?

02:52.477 --> 02:55.506
Trying to stop us from reaching Andy,
like she did last time.

02:55.580 --> 02:57.564
Felix, do something!

02:59.937 --> 03:03.100
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee.

03:03.121 --> 03:08.616
Water, Fire, Earth and Air,
aid in my quest - I call you forth.

03:08.637 --> 03:11.394
Water, Fire, Earth and Air...

03:12.238 --> 03:14.555
- No!
- This is not happening!

03:14.576 --> 03:16.727
We can't stay here. Come on!

03:27.094 --> 03:29.760
- Anything?
- Nothing. She's not there either.

03:29.781 --> 03:31.874
- Maybe she's gone.
- Not without the talisman.

03:31.895 --> 03:34.585
- How does that thing work?
- It needs all four of us.

03:34.606 --> 03:38.650
- It glows when there's a magical bad guy.
- She's not here. Come on.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.766
Can you slow Alice down,
get the cops on to her?

03:41.787 --> 03:43.127
Leave it with me.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.785
- Be careful.
- You too.

04:23.042 --> 04:25.973
There was another intersection on
the map. That's where we need to go.

04:25.994 --> 04:28.863
- You think there'll be another altar?
- I hope so.

04:31.259 --> 04:32.616
It's locked.

04:33.143 --> 04:35.001
- Freezing!
- How could it be locked?

04:35.022 --> 04:37.304
You just need to put
some muscle into it.

04:38.390 --> 04:40.639
How's that working out for you?

04:41.360 --> 04:44.320
- She's freezing us in.
- Oh, man!

04:44.341 --> 04:46.161
This way! Go, come on!

04:58.625 --> 04:59.898
Frozen.

05:00.158 --> 05:01.530
Nothing to it.

05:04.085 --> 05:06.121
Can we use the talisman?

05:06.209 --> 05:07.672
Jake, Sam!

05:08.835 --> 05:10.392
Hurry!

05:11.954 --> 05:13.514
Hey, come on!

05:14.564 --> 05:16.508
This isn't fair!

05:25.036 --> 05:27.781
That's Felix's Fire; one more.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.952
Jake - Earth.

05:36.552 --> 05:39.556
Who said magic spells
aren't glamorous?

05:40.568 --> 05:42.512
Uh, excuse me?

05:43.516 --> 05:47.224
Oh. I was just, um, wanting to...

05:47.318 --> 05:49.681
Put some menus in the staffroom?

05:49.781 --> 05:51.321
Right...

05:51.576 --> 05:53.196
Door was open, so...

05:54.658 --> 05:57.000
I'm gonna suggest
you come back on a school day.

05:57.021 --> 05:58.693
Ah, yeah - sure.

05:58.714 --> 06:00.893
Yeah - the exit's this way.

06:07.523 --> 06:09.631
Nope, nope - that way.

06:09.652 --> 06:11.385
- Oh.
- Yep.

06:19.322 --> 06:22.330
- Felix!
- Sam, Jake!

06:22.406 --> 06:26.485
- We have to get out of here, Felix!
- I know, I know! Stand back.

06:33.670 --> 06:36.342
It won't be hot. Try now.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.346
- What did you do?
- I melted the ice.

06:42.367 --> 06:45.381
- Can you blitz this one too?
- Don't need to.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.547
- Water...
- Fire, Earth and Air.

06:49.568 --> 06:51.792
Elements that we all share.

06:56.494 --> 06:57.830
Let's roll.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.776
Hello?

07:15.730 --> 07:18.918
- We need to find another tear.
- Why?

07:18.939 --> 07:22.287
To talk to my friends, so that we can
find a way to get me home.

07:22.394 --> 07:24.476
You don't... like it here?

07:26.130 --> 07:27.912
Of course not.

07:28.977 --> 07:31.431
I want some of Nai Nai's dumplings...

07:31.960 --> 07:34.949
And I wanna watch
science documentaries with Dad.

07:35.069 --> 07:38.792
I even wanna hear Viv call me
'her annoying little brother'.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.688
What's happening?

07:48.075 --> 07:49.606
You did this.

07:52.027 --> 07:53.614
Andy, run!

08:00.710 --> 08:04.040
- Why did you say I did this?
- Just run!

08:04.061 --> 08:06.617
- We're not gonna make it.
- We have to.

08:06.689 --> 08:09.876
- I can't!
- You can - if you try.

08:10.568 --> 08:12.493
- Wait!
- This way!

08:14.080 --> 08:18.765
Sorry about this, Murphy -
orders from head office.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.845
What is Alice doing?
Why trap us in the school?

08:44.866 --> 08:47.176
If she wanted the talisman,
we would have been sitting ducks.

08:47.197 --> 08:50.002
She's planning something,
but I've no idea what.

08:50.023 --> 08:52.071
Hang on -
let's check the maps again.

08:56.733 --> 08:59.818
If there's an altar
at every intersection...

08:59.904 --> 09:02.110
Then there's a third one here.

09:02.291 --> 09:06.901
But there's nothing out there
except... some old warehouses.

09:07.023 --> 09:08.910
It'll take forever to walk.

09:08.937 --> 09:12.742
- We need some wheels.
- I can't call my brother again.

09:14.318 --> 09:16.367
But I can go one better.

09:16.772 --> 09:19.416
- They can't do this.
- I'm sorry.

09:26.502 --> 09:30.486
I need a warrant for
Alice Hartley's arrest, urgently.

09:30.507 --> 09:33.197
- On what grounds?
- She's behind all this.

09:33.342 --> 09:35.066
She's a witch.

09:35.087 --> 09:37.724
I know she's not very pleasant,
but I wouldn't go that far.

09:37.726 --> 09:42.053
No, no. no. I mean,
she's a real, bona fide witch.

09:43.315 --> 09:45.322
Maybe that break will do you good.

09:46.088 --> 09:48.703
You reported me, didn't you?

09:49.527 --> 09:50.793
Why?

09:51.073 --> 09:55.061
Well, you haven't exactly
been acting rationally.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.071
You have no idea
what you've just done.

10:02.704 --> 10:03.979
Murphy.

10:17.721 --> 10:22.402
I don't understand.
I did that? How?

10:22.497 --> 10:25.999
What you feel - this place feels.

10:27.111 --> 10:30.991
That's not logical.
Places don't have feelings.

10:31.098 --> 10:35.379
- This place is different.
- I've managed to deduce that much.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.660
So...

10:38.612 --> 10:40.514
Figure out the rest.

10:46.421 --> 10:47.895
If I'm scared...

10:49.409 --> 10:51.409
Then this place is scary.

10:52.445 --> 10:54.707
And if I wanna go home...

10:57.189 --> 11:00.514
You're flickering.
Why are you flickering?

11:02.339 --> 11:04.633
You still don't understand, Andy.

11:08.097 --> 11:09.748
We think we've found another altar.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.217
It's miles away,
and we don't have much time.

11:12.441 --> 11:15.519
Alright. But you're not all
going to fit in my car.

11:15.540 --> 11:18.310
Seriously? It's an emergency,
and you're worrying about seatbelts?

11:18.331 --> 11:22.185
Yeah, seriously!
I'm still an officer of the law.

11:22.234 --> 11:25.084
I'll take four of you, max.

11:26.299 --> 11:29.349
It's OK, you guys go ahead.
Jake and I will be right.

11:30.121 --> 11:31.667
'Right' how?

11:33.877 --> 11:36.002
Sam, wait up!

11:41.396 --> 11:44.934
You look real.
You feel real.

11:45.401 --> 11:48.727
- How long have you been here?
- Forever.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.344
I can't stay here forever.

11:57.001 --> 11:58.674
Andy!

11:59.738 --> 12:02.053
I can learn to like it.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.556
That's not enough.

12:11.572 --> 12:16.548
There's a place
I'm not supposed to show you yet.

12:50.564 --> 12:55.025
This is amazing - windows
into other universes.

12:56.473 --> 12:58.107
It's endless.

12:58.437 --> 13:02.564
Every possible choice,
every possible decision.

13:07.406 --> 13:08.977
It's beautiful.

13:10.024 --> 13:11.717
She didn't think so.

13:13.940 --> 13:15.435
Who?

13:15.669 --> 13:17.417
Alice?

13:20.030 --> 13:21.761
Still want to go home?

13:25.576 --> 13:27.520
Show me more.

13:29.699 --> 13:32.026
Who do you keep
borrowing these bikes from?

13:32.047 --> 13:36.248
Oh, come on, you love it!
Now for a little turbo boost.

13:37.202 --> 13:39.934
Please tell me
that's just your wind powers!

13:43.142 --> 13:46.714
- What is this place?
- It's an old wool store.

13:49.193 --> 13:50.836
I wanna hold your hand.

13:50.857 --> 13:52.959
When you two are done flirting...?

14:00.242 --> 14:01.574
What was that?

14:02.111 --> 14:03.501
I don't know.

14:08.684 --> 14:10.680
This is priceless!

14:15.143 --> 14:17.163
Don't. Just don't.

14:17.379 --> 14:21.142
This place is the worst.
Creepy makes my hungry.

14:21.239 --> 14:24.915
- What doesn't make you hungry?
- Food.

14:25.931 --> 14:28.947
Come on.
We've got to find this altar.

14:28.968 --> 14:32.976
You go inside. I'll keep an eye out
for our favourite sisters.

14:33.198 --> 14:35.989
I'll need to find the right spell.

14:47.279 --> 14:51.508
Come on, magical altar thingummy.
Where are you?

14:54.776 --> 14:58.755
- This place is massive.
- Could be anywhere.

14:59.923 --> 15:03.149
How about it, Oscar?
Got any more magical-altar vibes?

15:03.349 --> 15:05.185
I'm not getting anything.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.806
You wouldn't do anything
stupid, would you?

15:26.827 --> 15:28.619
Based on recent experience?

15:28.640 --> 15:31.696
I know how badly
you want to get Andy back.

15:32.151 --> 15:33.420
We all do.

15:34.743 --> 15:38.077
Before... This is what I saw.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.747
This is me.

15:43.968 --> 15:47.970
- Do you know where I am?
- I think it's where Andy is.

15:48.434 --> 15:49.785
You can't do
it, Felix.

15:49.806 --> 15:52.112
- Do what?
- Go in after him.

15:52.872 --> 15:55.644
Even if I wanted to,
I don't know how.

15:55.936 --> 15:58.701
Promise me
you won't do anything stupid.

16:03.915 --> 16:05.867
I need to find the spell.

16:11.974 --> 16:13.941
- Got it.
- Felix!

16:14.018 --> 16:17.071
Hey, Felix, Oscar! Over here!

16:33.875 --> 16:35.735
That's what I said.

16:37.670 --> 16:41.967
So we've got everything we need now,
right? Talisman, altar.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.520
Here we come, Andy, ready or not.

16:55.367 --> 16:56.698
Hey!

17:04.101 --> 17:05.631
- Hello?
- They're here.

17:05.652 --> 17:06.887
Can you stop them?

17:08.042 --> 17:09.345
Frozen!

17:09.366 --> 17:10.575
Hello?

17:11.788 --> 17:13.077
Hey!

17:15.853 --> 17:18.134
OK, we have to hurry.

17:28.930 --> 17:31.437
I think... maybe...

17:39.816 --> 17:42.199
Whoa. Jackpot.

17:43.559 --> 17:47.708
- The talisman is a key.
- Now we open the door to Andy.

17:53.100 --> 17:57.427
Elements of the universe,
within and without,

17:58.096 --> 18:02.429
unlock the door, turn world about.

18:03.032 --> 18:06.603
Elements of the universe,
within and without,

18:06.624 --> 18:09.947
unlock the door, turn world about.

18:11.361 --> 18:13.136
How cool is this?

18:13.803 --> 18:15.851
Andy, can you hear me?
Are you there?

18:25.994 --> 18:29.000
Weird - it's the same.

18:30.018 --> 18:32.479
It's this place, but not.

18:33.485 --> 18:35.277
But where's Andy?

18:35.522 --> 18:37.132
Can you find him?

18:44.002 --> 18:45.527
- Andy!
- Dude!

18:46.954 --> 18:48.898
I figured it out.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.548
- Me too.
- I think I did it first.

18:51.569 --> 18:54.323
Really, guys? Still competitive?

18:54.354 --> 18:57.253
- Alice sent me here.
- Not sent - swapped.

18:57.274 --> 19:00.248
- Why?
- I think that's how it works.

19:00.545 --> 19:02.888
Someone has to be there.

19:03.099 --> 19:06.167
So to get you out,
we have to send someone else in.

19:06.403 --> 19:07.638
Like who?

19:09.017 --> 19:11.153
- Oscar!
- What are you doing?

19:11.174 --> 19:12.944
Can't let you, Felix.

19:13.027 --> 19:16.007
- Does someone want to give me a clue?
- I have no idea.

19:16.561 --> 19:18.569
Bear! What happened?

19:18.590 --> 19:21.205
- You want to leave me.
- My friends!

19:21.226 --> 19:23.714
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

19:24.313 --> 19:25.456
Bear!

19:26.136 --> 19:27.315
Bear!

19:28.504 --> 19:30.766
Bear, come back!

19:30.941 --> 19:33.482
- Oskie, what are you doing?
- It's for the best, Felix.

19:33.503 --> 19:35.245
Give it back, please!

19:35.938 --> 19:38.671
- Why are you doing this?
- Why don't you just tell them?

19:38.692 --> 19:40.947
- Tell us what?
- What's going on?

19:40.968 --> 19:43.717
He's gonna swap himself for Andy.
I was tryina stop him.

19:43.738 --> 19:45.953
- He's what?
- It's the only way to get him out.

19:45.974 --> 19:49.917
- You want to go in there on purpose?
- It'll take the heat off everyone.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.974
It'll stop Andy's family
from going out of their minds.

19:52.012 --> 19:54.433
What about you, your family...

19:54.824 --> 19:56.211
Me?

19:59.645 --> 20:03.421
Look, we'll get Andy out first
and we'll deal with the rest later.

20:13.084 --> 20:15.923
Come on, come on!

20:16.094 --> 20:17.864
Come on, start!

20:26.266 --> 20:29.049
Elements of the universe...

20:29.710 --> 20:31.948
Within and without.

20:32.723 --> 20:37.024
Unlock the door, turn world about.

20:37.104 --> 20:41.923
Elements that knit and bind,
hear my will, join different kinds.

20:41.945 --> 20:43.669
Barrier, no bar.

20:43.806 --> 20:45.271
She's here.

20:48.112 --> 20:51.329
Alice! We know you're here.

20:51.586 --> 20:53.992
You have to pay for what you've done.

20:54.995 --> 20:58.931
Space be no hindrance,
no barrier, no bar.

20:58.985 --> 21:04.129
Fire, Water, Earth and Air,
bound and shared together as one,

21:04.161 --> 21:07.356
access my power, limits undone.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.338
This isn't how it goes!

21:16.326 --> 21:17.686
Get ready.

21:20.617 --> 21:22.209
How will I know?

21:27.068 --> 21:31.179
- Felix, what's happening?
- Binding spell.

21:31.478 --> 21:32.982
Felix...?

21:34.100 --> 21:36.374
- Phoebe...?
- Keep going.

21:37.156 --> 21:38.616
Guys...?

21:40.658 --> 21:46.123
Fire, Water, Earth and Air,
bound and shared together as one.

21:46.808 --> 21:49.867
- What is this?
- Our powers...

21:50.185 --> 21:53.656
Access my power, limits undone.

22:03.847 --> 22:06.758
- I feel incredible!
- I told you.

22:07.068 --> 22:08.695
So strong...

22:11.528 --> 22:12.893
Look at this!

22:13.341 --> 22:15.887
You've got plenty of time
for showing off.

22:20.867 --> 22:22.506
Come on.

22:44.845 --> 22:46.152
It's over.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.591
Ellen?

23:12.032 --> 23:13.430
You OK?

23:14.750 --> 23:16.694
I think so...

23:22.617 --> 23:24.322
What happened?

23:26.526 --> 23:28.526
She really took our powers.

23:33.504 --> 23:35.168
Not even a spark.

23:38.455 --> 23:40.337
The ground's not moving.

23:42.112 --> 23:46.234
How could they do this?
Aren't our powers part of us?

23:48.992 --> 23:52.960
I've felt this before,
when Alice enchanted my legs.

23:52.989 --> 23:54.685
Binding spell.

23:55.012 --> 23:58.062
This time, she bound
our powers to Phoebe.

24:00.100 --> 24:04.040
So we're all just... normal?

24:09.524 --> 24:13.139
Normal... and powerless.

24:15.586 --> 24:16.933
It's game over.

24:19.645 --> 24:22.686
Alice has the talisman.
We're finished. Go home.

24:22.707 --> 24:25.410
- But what about Andy?
- Let me take Andy's place.

24:25.431 --> 24:28.182
- Don't be stupid.
- I'll go willingly.

24:28.203 --> 24:32.066
- You can keep your powers.
- He's going after Andy by himself.

24:32.541 --> 24:35.990
- Wait! You don't understand.
- We completely understand!

24:36.011 --> 24:39.111
- We have to get out of here.
- Seriously, dude, now!

24:39.132 --> 24:42.651
Order must be restored.
You must restore it.

24:42.699 --> 24:44.016
Bear...?

24:45.401 --> 24:46.694
Bear!

24:47.616 --> 24:49.256
Run, go!

24:50.081 --> 24:51.391
Andy...

24:51.412 --> 24:54.352
- Andy's the restoring demon?
- Just like Alice was.

24:54.423 --> 24:57.655
- He wouldn't hurt us!
- Maybe he doesn't have a choice.
