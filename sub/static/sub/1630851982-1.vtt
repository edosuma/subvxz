00:11.929 --> 00:13.139
[soft dramatic music]

00:30.030 --> 00:31.866
[Jane] I hope everyone could
have the experience that I've

00:31.907 --> 00:33.284
had with my family.

00:35.453 --> 00:37.830
I, uh God, I can’t even
imagine what it would be like

00:37.872 --> 00:38.706
without them.

00:40.458 --> 00:43.002
My life would have ended up
in a much different direction

00:43.043 --> 00:43.878
if I didn't have them.

00:46.464 --> 00:49.008
It is my safe place. It is my
home,

00:49.049 --> 00:52.762
and where I feel the
most comfortable.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.017
I hope for a world where

00:58.058 --> 01:02.062
being yourself is instantly
acceptable.

01:21.081 --> 01:21.916
[music playing]

01:28.506 --> 01:30.090
So this is my room.

01:30.925 --> 01:33.093
Mirror. Gotta check.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.060
I need to get my hair cut.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.062
I have so many split ends.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.065
Disgusting!

01:46.106 --> 01:49.068
You see Youtubers doing this
crap.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.654
That’s not a good angle.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.113
Okay, bye.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.492
My name is Jane.
I'm a senior in high school.

01:57.117 --> 02:03.082
My family is crazy, and loud,
and obnoxious, but...

02:03.123 --> 02:06.919
We're a family and at the end
of the day we're always gonna

02:06.961 --> 02:09.129
be there for each other
no matter what.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.552
- Good morning.
- Morning.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.806
[Laura] I was a vegetarian,
please.

02:18.848 --> 02:20.975
[David] That’s what warned us
to Jane’s girlfriends.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.061
They're vegetarians and she
makes likes soups and stuff,

02:24.144 --> 02:27.106
and I'm like, that's, that's,
that's chicken stock.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.943
She's vegetarian. She's
like "Ah, she'll never know."

02:30.985 --> 02:32.778
[Laura] They won't know they
are on day one again.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.530
[David] You're sinister.

02:34.572 --> 02:39.910
[Jane] My mom's name is Laura
and she is very loyal.

02:41.495 --> 02:45.916
And she's always being
annoying, and over-stepping

02:45.958 --> 02:48.544
sometimes, but it's only
because she cares.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.462
Thank you for the eggs mom.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.507
[Laura] You're welcome. Thank
you for cleaning the dishes.

02:55.009 --> 02:55.843
Okay.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.930
She’s a mama bear. That’s how
she describes it, but

02:59.972 --> 03:03.058
I wish everyone had a Laura
in their life.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.603
[David] That's it. She will
not move now.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.146
[laughter]

03:07.187 --> 03:08.814
[Laura] That's really pretty,
girl.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.902
[Jane] My dad, David...

03:12.943 --> 03:16.822
He is honestly the best dad I
could ask for.

03:16.864 --> 03:20.451
He is very funny and
embarrassing.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.994
Is that you, dada?

03:22.036 --> 03:23.162
[David] Yeah, hi honey.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.997
[Jane] Are you pooping?

03:25.039 --> 03:25.748
[David] It's really bad in here.

03:25.789 --> 03:26.624
[Jane] Oh.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.628
Hey...

03:30.669 --> 03:31.629
[Mae] Ugh!

03:31.670 --> 03:35.174
[laughter]

03:35.215 --> 03:37.176
[Jane] And Mae...

03:37.217 --> 03:38.928
She’s the smartest one out of
all of us.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.680
She has her moments where we're
just laughing so hard

03:41.722 --> 03:44.683
that we can't even control it.

03:45.851 --> 03:46.852
- That's gross
- Ow, fuck, Mae!

03:50.689 --> 03:53.317
We put lash adhesive on
our lips.

03:53.359 --> 03:56.195
I'm Debby Ryan now.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.197
[Mae] Ew it looks like I got
stung by a bee.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.698
[laughter]

03:59.740 --> 04:02.409
[Jane] Emma, let me see yours.

04:02.451 --> 04:06.205
Emma, she’s my other sister.
She’s the oldest.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.582
And what can I
say about her...

04:08.624 --> 04:10.209
She's a bitch!
No, I'm kidding.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.087
Am I gonna be famous?

04:13.128 --> 04:14.421
[Jane & Mae] No.

04:14.463 --> 04:15.214
[laughter]

04:15.255 --> 04:17.007
She’s in the Coast Guard
Academy.

04:17.049 --> 04:17.675
Coast Guard Cutter Yeagan,

04:17.716 --> 04:20.052
this is Coast Guard Cutter
Hamilton, over.

04:20.094 --> 04:23.639
[Jane] She comes home
sometimes on weekends.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.767
She's very much my like my dad
and my mom if they were like

04:26.809 --> 04:27.393
mixed together.

04:27.434 --> 04:31.230
She’s very overprotective. She's
a very positive person

04:31.271 --> 04:32.272
to be around.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.570
[indistinct]

04:38.612 --> 04:41.448
[Emma] You're overevaluating
food.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.909
You're like this...
"So, how is it?"

04:43.951 --> 04:45.828
[Mae] You know what he does?
You know what he does?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.871
He eats something and he sits
there like this...

04:49.206 --> 04:52.835
Yeah, why do you do
that? He does do that!

04:52.876 --> 04:54.086
But then we're like "What
are you doing?"

04:54.128 --> 04:57.256
And then he's like "I'm
feeling the food."

04:57.297 --> 05:00.134
"I'm knowing the food."

05:01.051 --> 05:03.887
[Jane] My grandfather, his
name is Gabriel.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.180
Hi!

05:05.222 --> 05:05.931
[Gabriel] Hi, honey.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.141
- You want a new one?
- Yeah.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.893
[Jane] We call him Jidu
because in Arabic...

05:09.935 --> 05:12.271
Jidu means grandfather or
grandpa.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.689
[Gabriel] You sleep good?

05:13.731 --> 05:14.231
[Jane] Yeah.

05:14.314 --> 05:18.986
He just loves everything about
our family. He's so funny.

05:19.028 --> 05:23.032
[Gabriel] I was a mason. I
became head of my lodge,

05:23.073 --> 05:26.243
which became the master, the
master of the lodge.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.079
They used to refer to me as
worshipful master.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.540
My wife would tell me,
"Worshipful master, take the

05:31.582 --> 05:33.917
garbage out."

05:33.959 --> 05:38.797
I was born in Brooklyn. In
Methodist Hospital.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.883
February 9th, 1929.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.218
It's funny, before I married
my wife I wanted to buy

05:43.260 --> 05:47.723
a Cadillac convertible. It was
between getting married or

05:47.765 --> 05:50.559
buying a Cadillac. I got
married instead.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.979
Best thing I ever did, because
she was a wonderful, wonderful

05:54.021 --> 05:55.064
person.

05:55.105 --> 05:59.318
I adopted my daughter Laura.
She was one week old.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.737
And that's who I'm living here
with.

06:01.779 --> 06:04.323
You couldn't ask for a better
daughter than Laura.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.742
I think you're ahead of me by
one.

06:06.784 --> 06:09.661
They take care of me like you
wouldn't believe.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.748
I want to live long enough to
see my grandchildren grow.

06:12.790 --> 06:14.750
Because I really am enjoying
them.

06:14.792 --> 06:19.755
Bye, Jidu.
Bye.

06:19.797 --> 06:23.592
I have about six more months
left before...

06:23.634 --> 06:25.636
...my whole life is gonna
change.

06:26.804 --> 06:29.389
I don't really talk about it
that much, but...

06:32.309 --> 06:35.187
...like it's not a secret
that I'm trans.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.357
And I don't really think it's
gonna be a secret...

06:38.398 --> 06:39.358
when I get my surgery.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.112
So might as well be honest.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.201
Going to school.

06:50.410 --> 06:55.415
This guy has been
hitting me up.

06:56.166 --> 07:00.963
I don't think he knows... that
I'm trans.

07:01.839 --> 07:04.633
As a transgender woman, in my
opinion,

07:04.675 --> 07:09.888
for my own safety I tell them
before I go out with them.

07:10.848 --> 07:13.392
Like three years ago I never
talked to anybody.

07:13.433 --> 07:18.021
And I was like 15. I'm 18 now.
And I was like, so shy.

07:18.063 --> 07:18.689
And I was like...

07:18.730 --> 07:20.691
I always felt like no one was
ever gonna love me

07:20.732 --> 07:21.984
because of it.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.444
Or no one would ever want to
even talk to me, not just love.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.531
But like no one would ever
even want to like consider me.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.035
It made me cry because I can't
really control that.

07:32.077 --> 07:38.167
Like, it's how I was born, and
like, it's not the only thing

07:38.208 --> 07:41.837
that's... like that's not the
only thing that defines me.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.631
But like, I'm not gonna lie
about it to someone.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.092
Because like, that's just lying
to myself too.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.304
But I don't know. Like, I'm not
worried about that.

07:50.345 --> 07:53.390
I just like I don't... It's just
not the right time for me
I don't think.

07:53.432 --> 07:58.812
My life's kinda normal. I go to
work, go to school. That's it.

07:58.854 --> 07:59.855
[Jane] Into hell we go.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.483
[Faith] Oh.

08:05.944 --> 08:06.695
Look cute today.

08:06.737 --> 08:09.031
[Lucy] Video me, but
not too close.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.076
[Faith] I look like a circle.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.953
- Wait put this forward
- First of all...

08:14.995 --> 08:16.872
- No, like come over here
- Wavy hair.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.457
[Jane] Aim it at her.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.501
Move the chair. Move the chair
up.

08:21.919 --> 08:24.129
And then [inaudible]

08:24.171 --> 08:26.298
Instead of going to my
district high school,

08:26.340 --> 08:30.093
I went into a trade school. It
was just a relief to be able to

08:30.135 --> 08:33.472
start over. And not have to
worry about people seeing me

08:33.513 --> 08:35.307
change and make comments on it
and stuff.

08:35.349 --> 08:39.478
So I just wanted a new slate,
and introduce myself as Jane

08:39.519 --> 08:41.521
to my peers and everyone.

08:43.523 --> 08:47.027
So yeah, I'm in my senior year
of high school now.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.073
I do cinematography. We film
here.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.284
Me and my friends are all
excited to just be, done.

08:54.326 --> 08:58.497
We want to get out of here,
get into college and just

08:58.538 --> 08:59.915
move onto something else.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.918
We're tired of being in Sparta
and Sussex.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.462
I'm gonna apply to SVA soon

09:05.545 --> 09:08.507
and SVA is the School of
Visual Arts.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.760
And it's based in Manhattan,
but they have schools all

09:11.802 --> 09:14.263
around the world. Hopefully I
get in there.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.515
So that's gonna be exciting.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.517
And... action.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.019
How do you feel right now?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.981
[Faith] About what?
Like about what?

09:24.022 --> 09:25.524
[Jane] Like about everything?

09:25.565 --> 09:29.945
I feel... I don't know what
you're like, referring to.

09:29.987 --> 09:33.949
Okay, what do you think
about me modeling?

09:33.991 --> 09:35.867
I think it's a great
opportunity.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.452
Why do you have to
talk like that?

09:37.494 --> 09:40.956
Because I think it's a
magnificent opportunity for her

09:40.998 --> 09:43.542
to do this.
Alright, restart.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.585
Faith, why do you?

09:46.962 --> 09:53.969
I think you can do
whatever you put your mind to.

09:54.011 --> 09:57.973
- That's what I think.
- Alright

09:58.015 --> 10:00.058
Are you homophobic?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.561
I'm heterophobic.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.021
I didn't talk to you
freshman year.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.022
Yeah, you really didn't.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.898
Because I was intimidated by
you.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.027
I was like, "Her films are so
good and mine

10:10.068 --> 10:11.445
are not that good."

10:14.531 --> 10:16.700
[Jane] Films in general have
always interested me

10:16.742 --> 10:19.911
and I was always trying to
be artistic in a way.

10:19.953 --> 10:24.416
And this was always a way for
me to escape my reality

10:24.458 --> 10:26.960
when I was younger, cause even
though I didn't know

10:27.002 --> 10:30.714
I was trans, like I didn't
like my life at the time,

10:30.756 --> 10:32.424
because I didn't know who I
was.

10:32.466 --> 10:37.012
I was struggling a lot and I
think film was a way

10:37.054 --> 10:38.055
to escape that.

10:42.059 --> 10:45.437
[Faith] Jane wasn't very open
to us, me and Lucy...

10:45.479 --> 10:47.606
...for a little while, but um

10:47.647 --> 10:49.107
like we weren't gonna ask
or anything...

10:49.149 --> 10:51.234
- Like that wasn't our business.
- About being trans?

10:51.276 --> 10:54.613
Yeah, like, that's not
my business and I didn't care.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.033
When was it? Sophmore year,
Junior year? I don't know.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.034
Get out of my way!

10:59.076 --> 11:01.495
Earthquake.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.623
[Jane] Are you excited to go
prom shopping?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.249
You have to bring your
camera to that!

11:06.291 --> 11:10.462
[Jane] Yeah, I am.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.631
What are you looking for for a
prom dress?

11:12.672 --> 11:15.634
Something that's gonna
wow all the bitches

11:15.675 --> 11:17.677
in Sussex county.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.684
[music playing]

11:30.023 --> 11:31.858
That's my mom.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.654
Hi, the world. What
are we doing today, Jane?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.656
We're gonna go prom
dress shopping.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.659
So, who are you going with?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.452
There's no boy in the
picture.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.287
I'm just, I didn't ask
if there was a boy.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.664
You don't need a boy
to go to the prom.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.083
I know. I'm just gonna
be going alone I guess.

11:48.125 --> 11:53.130
Hanging out, having
fun, dancing.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.715
[Laura] Pretty dresses.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.721
Look at all the choices.

12:02.722 --> 12:09.104
How do I zoom out?

12:09.146 --> 12:10.689
What do you think?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.691
[Salesperson] This is very
good material.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.401
[Laura] You'll be a bride.

12:14.443 --> 12:15.444
[Jane] Oh God!

12:18.155 --> 12:22.242
Before, I never talked about
being trans with my friends.

12:22.284 --> 12:26.413
Because I was so uncomfortable
with my body parts

12:26.455 --> 12:28.832
and people knowing about that.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.709
[Laura] What do you think
about that one?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.711
[Jane] It makes my butt look
good.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.714
Like if someone asked me if I
was trans I would be honest

12:35.755 --> 12:40.343
but it just didn't make me
feel like a woman.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.389
[Laura] Yeah, I
don't like that.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.724
[Jane] And I hated
feeling that.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.726
[Laura] That's a no from mom.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.352
[Jane] I think I've learned
that it doesn't make me

12:49.394 --> 12:50.562
less of a woman

12:50.604 --> 12:52.731
for people to want to know
about my journey and...

12:52.772 --> 12:56.026
what I've been through.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.736
I've had so many issues with
my body

12:57.777 --> 13:00.739
and I'm just so tired of
hating it that I really

13:00.780 --> 13:04.326
just wanted to choose to love
myself and be happy.

13:04.367 --> 13:08.371
And not have anything hold me
back from that.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.750
[Laura] Wow.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.793
[Lucy] So, yes to the dress?

13:22.219 --> 13:26.223
Is ten a lot? I'll do
eight.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.771
[coffee dripping]

13:37.817 --> 13:40.195
[Laura] People would say when
Jane first came out.

13:40.237 --> 13:44.616
They would say to me. "Laura
you're like, such a cool mom."

13:44.658 --> 13:48.328
I'm like, "Why am I cool mom?"
"Well you have a transgender

13:48.370 --> 13:50.413
kid. That's so hip and cool."
I'm like what!?

13:50.455 --> 13:55.794
I didn't know that, I didn't
know I was trendy, you know.

13:55.835 --> 14:02.801
Thanks Jane. You know, but um...
Like... I don't know.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.219
[David] The heck.

14:04.261 --> 14:05.428
[Laura] What?

14:05.470 --> 14:10.809
[David] She got two detentions
because of being tardy.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.726
Did you know that?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.728
No, why would I know that?

14:13.770 --> 14:15.397
[David] Because we're her
parents.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.816
[Laura] Why didn't you know
it?

14:17.857 --> 14:22.195
[David] Well it was supposed
to channel through you to me.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.615
[Laura] Oh, really?
I didn't get that memo.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.659
[David] The gradudation is
scheduled for the 17th?

14:27.701 --> 14:28.326
No.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.703
- Surgery is the 17th?
- Yeah.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.831
Oh, but the operation is, it's
the 17th?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.666
[Laura] I don't think they
know about that.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.626
Did you wanna talk about that
Jane?

14:36.668 --> 14:38.253
[Jane] I don't care.

14:38.295 --> 14:42.841
[Laura] So Jane is scheduled
to have her, um...

14:42.882 --> 14:44.676
How do you say it?

14:44.718 --> 14:46.845
[Jane] Confirmation.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.806
[Laura] Confirmation surgery.

14:49.848 --> 14:53.184
On the 17th which is her high
school graduation date

14:53.226 --> 14:56.271
so we're missing that.

14:56.313 --> 15:00.859
So, a lot of stuff happening
at the Noury Household.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.861
For the next couple of months.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.864
[Jane] When I first came out I
told my mom I wanted

15:05.905 --> 15:10.827
the surgery. Not everyone
who’s trans has surgery. Like,

15:10.869 --> 15:14.998
that's not a requirement when
you are trans. Like, you do not

15:15.040 --> 15:20.879
have to go through a surgery
to feel "completed"

15:20.920 --> 15:24.299
or to "complete" your journey.

15:24.341 --> 15:29.471
So it's really up to you and
what you want and what you

15:29.512 --> 15:33.892
feel is going to help you
minimize the dysphoria you have

15:33.933 --> 15:34.893
with your body.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.937
I know that this will make me
happy.

15:39.939 --> 15:44.903
Today, like, a boy was asking
me, "I know you're transgender

15:44.944 --> 15:47.322
but like, what did you look
like when you were a boy?"

15:47.364 --> 15:50.158
I was like, "What do you mean
when I looked like a boy?"

15:50.200 --> 15:55.914
I looked the exact same I guess,
I just had shorter hair

15:55.955 --> 16:00.919
He's like, "Can I ask you a
personal question?"

16:00.960 --> 16:03.296
"Didn't you have anything
done, cause like you're

16:03.338 --> 16:04.547
transgender?"

16:04.589 --> 16:08.927
I was like, "No I’m just a girl.
I didn’t get anything done."

16:08.968 --> 16:11.763
Being transgender does not
mean surgery.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.934
That's a totally different,
like, conversation.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.728
I don’t want their first
question to be like,

16:18.770 --> 16:20.939
"Oh, what's in your pants?"

16:20.980 --> 16:25.819
Because it's just so personal.

16:27.404 --> 16:28.488
That’s what transitioning is.

16:28.530 --> 16:32.117
It's whatever makes you feel
good about yourself

16:32.158 --> 16:36.663
and what helps alleviate that
gender dysphoria and makes

16:36.705 --> 16:41.960
you feel more the person that
you feel on the inside.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.962
- It's scary.
- Very nervous.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.465
And it was a long road getting
to this point you know?

16:47.507 --> 16:50.969
Clearing her for surgery...
but yeah, we're nervous.

16:51.010 --> 16:55.974
[David] All the different
psychologists and therapists

16:56.015 --> 17:00.979
that we've had to visit all
confirming that she needs this.

17:01.020 --> 17:07.360
You know, for her to be happy
for the rest of her life.

17:07.402 --> 17:11.990
-We support it but we're scared.
-Of course.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.869
And it's an entire team
that you have to meet with

17:15.910 --> 17:20.832
and uh, yeah, they scheduled
us, so...

17:20.874 --> 17:24.002
[David] And they have this
really graphic powerpoint

17:24.043 --> 17:30.008
showing the process and look,
it's, it's...

17:30.049 --> 17:34.012
It's hard. It's hard to...
It's not for everyone.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.639
But they’re showing all the
vaginas

17:36.681 --> 17:40.643
and the room is silent and
Laura goes "Hey that’s me!"

17:40.685 --> 17:41.853
[laughter]

17:41.895 --> 17:43.438
"I think I see me up there!"

17:43.480 --> 17:44.439
[Laura] "What am I doing up
there?"

17:44.481 --> 17:48.026
[laughter]

17:48.067 --> 17:53.031
But it was like Emma, Jane, May,
me, David and we were all like

17:53.072 --> 17:56.075
this looking at
all the vaginas.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.037
[Jane] So embarassing.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.079
[Laura] And you agreed David.

18:02.081 --> 18:06.044
[laughter]

18:06.085 --> 18:11.049
[Laura] Yeah, we're embarassing
wherever we go.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.093
It's pretty funny.

18:15.094 --> 18:20.058
A little piece...
All of Jane's information

18:20.099 --> 18:27.065
that I’ve been collecting
over.. Since she came out to us.

18:27.106 --> 18:33.071
If anybody ever thinks that
this was an easy decision,

18:33.112 --> 18:37.158
or that we were just like "Sure
Jane,

18:37.200 --> 18:43.873
let's go, you know, have a sex
change. Whatever you want."

18:43.915 --> 18:47.085
It wasn't like an overnight
decision.

18:47.126 --> 18:52.090
It was years and years of
preparation.

18:52.131 --> 18:59.097
Of legal papers.
Of therapy appointments.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.516
There’s one to give her
permission...

19:01.558 --> 19:06.312
Here it is. "This complies with
the student's ability to play a

19:06.354 --> 19:11.025
sport of the affirmed sex. In
this case Jane would like to

19:11.067 --> 19:11.985
play soccer."

19:15.154 --> 19:19.492
Here's my girl, on the girl's
soccer team.

19:19.534 --> 19:23.538
Living her truth and having a
great time at it.

19:33.172 --> 19:38.136
[Jane] What about the modeling
thing? I'm really excited.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.138
It's going to be so much fun.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.556
Ready?

19:41.598 --> 19:43.141
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.394
[Faith] How do I do this? What
do I with my arms?

19:46.436 --> 19:48.187
[Jane] Just move them.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.985
I fucking hate you.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.321
[David] It's hard to believe
that this all just came from

19:56.362 --> 19:59.157
just sort of, like, you
just sending a headshot

19:59.198 --> 20:00.033
and then...

20:00.074 --> 20:01.701
[Laura] I know! Like the
pictures that she was putting

20:01.743 --> 20:03.912
on Instagram were just so
beautiful.

20:03.953 --> 20:09.584
I just felt that I wanted to try
to submit to modeling agencies

20:09.626 --> 20:10.501
and see where it went.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.253
She always says that like "Oh my
God you can be a

20:12.295 --> 20:14.047
model. You should be a model."

20:14.088 --> 20:16.174
I'm just in high school and,
you know...

20:16.215 --> 20:21.179
I had... I've had no
experience so... maybe?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.181
[Laura] We're going to
California

20:23.222 --> 20:25.183
- I know.
- for this competition.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.601
[Laura] Are you prepared?

20:26.643 --> 20:28.603
[Jane] Probably not, I still
have to get a bunch of stuff.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.980
What even is it? Like,
what's going to happen?

20:31.022 --> 20:36.194
So it's a modeling
competition for 20 girls

20:36.235 --> 20:38.196
around the world. It's a
global model competition.

20:38.237 --> 20:42.200
It's for transgender models, and
we're all gonna meet in L.A.

20:42.241 --> 20:47.205
and compete to sign with the
Slay model agency.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.206
[Laura] Gretel.

20:48.247 --> 20:52.627
[David] You're my true mother,
and I remember succinctly

20:52.669 --> 20:57.382
being nestled gently
inside your womb like a little

20:57.423 --> 20:59.425
Bratwurst.

21:03.262 --> 21:07.266
[Lucy] I remember last year's,
um, English class.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.811
We were talking about like,
transgender people.

21:09.852 --> 21:13.481
My teacher brought up...
She was like,

21:13.523 --> 21:16.901
"Uh so you guys, like, know this
girl Jane?"

21:16.943 --> 21:20.238
I raised my hand and I was
like "Yeah she's my best
friend."

21:20.279 --> 21:22.782
[Jane] Everyone from my old
school... I don't talk to them

21:22.824 --> 21:25.243
at all. It's just so awkward.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.121
Like we weren't really friends
anymore.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.747
- We haven't been here
- I'm surprised it's still

21:29.789 --> 21:31.541
- in so long.
- up it's so old.

21:31.582 --> 21:32.792
[Jane] I remember this being
so loud.

21:32.834 --> 21:33.918
[swing squeaking]

21:33.960 --> 21:38.256
[Lucy] Yeah, you always got
the one that squeaked.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.341
[Jane] I wish it was sunny.
It's so much prettier

21:40.383 --> 21:44.303
when it's sunny here. And like
peaceful.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.683
[Lucy] Oh, I miss the summer.

21:48.725 --> 21:53.271
[Jane] Do you miss anything,
like, about the old me?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.481
Like, do you miss him in any
type of way?

21:55.523 --> 21:57.275
Or do you think that nothing
ever really changed?

21:57.316 --> 22:00.903
No, I feel like you're the same
still.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.116
Cause I know like some families

22:05.158 --> 22:09.746
are like, "I miss my kid." Like,
"I miss having my son

22:09.787 --> 22:11.789
or my daughter back." Like, "I
want them back."

22:11.831 --> 22:15.585
When really like, they're still
them.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.421
But they're just changing their
gender. Like, that's it.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.298
They didn't change
anything about them.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.299
Just their appearance.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.926
Oh, I'm so cold.

22:23.968 --> 22:28.598
I need to start walking. It's
freezing just sitting there.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.308
[Lucy] What about you?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.060
[Jane] What about me?

22:32.101 --> 22:33.144
[Lucy] Do you miss anything?

22:33.186 --> 22:38.191
[Jane] About me? No, I mean I
miss... I just pity my old self.

22:38.232 --> 22:42.695
Because, like, I was just so
sad. Like, you remember...

22:42.737 --> 22:43.446
I remember calling you...

22:43.488 --> 22:45.323
- Yeah, I remember.
- I called you at night.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.242
[Jane] Like, almost every night
just crying to you.

22:48.284 --> 22:52.330
- You were always there for me.
- Yeah, you're a lot happier
now.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.665
[Jane] Yeah, I was depressed.
Especially, like...

22:54.707 --> 22:56.292
Yeah, it's like, 7th grade. It
was like the worst year.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.252
[Lucy] You definetly love
yourself better.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.296
[Jane] 7th grade was the worst
year.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.970
[Jane] I don't look at my old
name as like,

23:08.012 --> 23:09.639
something that was so foreign to
me.

23:09.680 --> 23:13.559
Like an alien, or like something
that never existed.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.186
I don't pretend like I didn't
exist before.

23:15.228 --> 23:19.857
Because I was once a child who
was growing up as a boy.

23:19.899 --> 23:25.780
Like, from zero to fourteen I
was growing up as a male.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.740
And that's all I knew.

23:27.782 --> 23:31.202
Seeing my little sister and my
older sister, doing... painting

23:31.244 --> 23:34.122
their nails and doing make up
and talking about girl things.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.081
Like, I wanted to be part of
it,

23:35.123 --> 23:38.376
but I felt like I never could
because I was on the other side

23:38.417 --> 23:40.711
of being a boy and I didn't know
how to

23:40.753 --> 23:43.506
express my emotions and feel
feelings like that because

23:43.548 --> 23:46.384
I had to learn to be a girl.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.387
I had to learn to do feminine
things and put on make-up

23:49.428 --> 23:52.390
and buy clothes, girl clothes. I
was used to buying boy clothes.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.935
And not getting ready all the
time and doing my hair.

23:55.977 --> 23:56.978
I wasn't used to that stuff.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.150
Wait, let me see first.

24:02.191 --> 24:08.406
No!
No.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.448
Not good.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.413
[giggling]

24:15.454 --> 24:17.456
Mae!

24:21.460 --> 24:25.423
[Mae] Ew! Why does he look
like that?

24:25.464 --> 24:30.553
Jane's friend likes a boy and
said boy is talking to Jane.

24:30.595 --> 24:33.681
And Jane is not helping her
situation.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.435
Because she keeps snapping him
back.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.229
Okay, but we're... It's
nothing though.

24:40.271 --> 24:41.439
But you're snapping your face.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.442
- I snap everyone.
- Face means you want to talk

24:44.483 --> 24:47.737
- to him. That's Snapchat logic.
- So, what should I send?

24:47.778 --> 24:51.282
Your forehead!

24:51.324 --> 24:53.159
Talk to the forehead.

24:53.201 --> 24:56.454
[Mae] When you send you face and
you smile where you're like...

24:56.495 --> 24:58.539
[Jane] I'm not doing any of
that.

24:58.581 --> 24:59.624
[Mae] Yes, you are!

24:59.665 --> 25:03.294
[Jane] I'm just doing...

25:03.336 --> 25:06.464
[Mae] That's what you do!

25:06.505 --> 25:07.465
Yeah, it makes your nose
smaller.

25:07.506 --> 25:11.427
[Jane] I don't inhale.

25:11.469 --> 25:15.640
I just do... I just lift my
eyebrows up.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.475
[Mae] That means, "I wanna talk
to you."

25:17.516 --> 25:18.309
[Jane] This?

25:18.351 --> 25:19.977
[Mae] When you don't want to
talk to somebody, you have to

25:20.019 --> 25:23.481
look a little bit ugly. So
that they don't talk to you.

25:23.522 --> 25:28.736
I'm helping you here, and what
do you do? Ignore my advice?

25:28.778 --> 25:33.658
There's no... Okay, I'm
done. I'm done. Nothing.

25:33.699 --> 25:36.202
You should be telling
this to him. Not to me.

25:36.244 --> 25:39.956
- That'd be so...
[mocking noises]

25:39.997 --> 25:48.005
[playful screaming]

25:57.390 --> 26:01.686
[David] Jane, honey, I love you
but you have a responsibility.

26:01.727 --> 26:07.525
You gotta go to work, honey.
You only got ten minutes.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.568
[Jane] I'm going. I'm going.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.821
[David] You still gotta get
changed. It takes 10 minutes

26:11.862 --> 26:13.364
to get over there.

26:13.406 --> 26:14.949
[Jane] Alright.

26:14.991 --> 26:16.534
[Mae] You have to go to work.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.369
[Jane] I'm going to hit you.
Again.

26:18.411 --> 26:21.205
[indistinct]

26:21.247 --> 26:23.541
[Jane] Love you. Bye.

26:23.582 --> 26:28.170
[Mae] You'll have a great time.
Go make some memories.

26:28.212 --> 26:31.215
[Jane] Shut up!
You are a bitch.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.594
[music playing]

26:37.596 --> 26:38.556
[Coworker] Oh, you do that?

26:38.597 --> 26:42.560
[Jane] I do that. I just always
see people do that.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.602
[music playing]

26:48.607 --> 26:50.192
[Customer] When is this
modeling thing?

26:50.234 --> 26:52.320
[Jane] Saturday, I go Saturday.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.821
It's for a whole week. It
ends the...

26:53.863 --> 26:57.825
It starts the 8th and ends the
15th of February.

26:57.867 --> 27:01.954
[Customer] Are you actually in
the show. You're competing?

27:01.996 --> 27:04.874
[Jane] Yes. It's a competition
against 25 other girls.

27:04.915 --> 27:07.460
Well, 24.

27:07.501 --> 27:11.589
During her shifts, um,
she'll practice her walk. Um...

27:11.630 --> 27:14.050
I do, and then you yell
at me.

27:14.091 --> 27:17.636
You're like, "Stop walking."

27:21.640 --> 27:24.977
[Laura] You gonna let me win?

27:25.019 --> 27:28.606
[Gabriel] Am I gonna let you
win? No.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.609
You gotta earn it.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.612
I like sports. I love sports.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.614
That’s what I watch on tv.

27:36.655 --> 27:40.242
Baseball and football.

27:40.284 --> 27:41.786
I'm a registered Republican.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.914
This country was founded on
great principles,

27:44.955 --> 27:48.626
and the Democrats don’t follow
those great principles.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.294
It's too bad.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.633
But if a good Democrat came
along I'd vote for them.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.636
I like... I look at the person.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.263
[Laura] Daddy, teach me the
moves in Arabic.

28:01.305 --> 28:08.646
[speaks Turkish]

28:08.687 --> 28:10.106
[Gabriel] That's Turkish, not
Arabic.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.274
[Laura] We'll say it in Arabic.
What's that?

28:12.316 --> 28:14.777
[speaks Arabic]

28:14.819 --> 28:17.822
[Laura] That's shit, because
I've got nothing.

28:17.863 --> 28:23.494
[speaking Arabic]

28:23.536 --> 28:26.705
[Gabriel] I am very broad
minded. I am not a prejudiced

28:26.747 --> 28:32.294
person either. I take you for
what you are.

28:32.336 --> 28:36.340
Because that's the way I am. I
was brought up that way.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.301
I have a lot to be thankful
for. I really do.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.219
[Laura] I beat you.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.680
[Gabriel] You beat me. She
beat me.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.682
[Laura] Look in the camera and
say, "I beat you."

28:44.723 --> 28:45.516
[Gabriel] Huh?

28:45.558 --> 28:46.976
[Laura] Look into the camera
and say...

28:47.017 --> 28:50.521
She beat me, and I taught

28:50.563 --> 28:52.398
her how to play this game.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.691
You did not teach me!

28:53.732 --> 28:55.693
But she's pretty good.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.736
[ringing]

28:59.738 --> 29:02.700
- Hey!
- Hey!

29:02.741 --> 29:04.452
[Jane] How are you?

29:04.493 --> 29:06.704
[Emma] I'm good, how are you?
I think I'm sick.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.330
[Jane] Ew!

29:08.372 --> 29:10.124
[Laura] How you doing, Em?

29:10.166 --> 29:12.543
[Emma] I'm good. So let me ask
you a question.

29:12.585 --> 29:15.212
I was looking at the website,
the Slay website, the other day.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.382
This is like a competition,
right? If you win what happens?

29:18.424 --> 29:19.717
[Jane] I'll be signed to an
agency

29:19.758 --> 29:22.636
and I'll be able to get
jobs.

29:22.678 --> 29:26.015
[Emma] Woooow!

29:26.056 --> 29:28.350
[Jane] You're so dumb.

29:28.392 --> 29:29.894
[Emma] If it's not meant to be,
it's not meant to be.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.730
But I feel like it is.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.482
[Emma] I go to the United
States Coast Guard Academy

29:34.523 --> 29:36.233
in New London, Connecticut.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.570
I try to go home to see my
family when I can.

29:39.612 --> 29:42.948
[Laura] Everybody, when I say I
have a transgender daughter,

29:42.990 --> 29:45.993
they say, "Oh the one in the
military, that Emma?"

29:46.035 --> 29:48.579
[Emma] Yeah, like listen to
that.

29:48.621 --> 29:51.707
I remember in high school I
was very protective over Jane.

29:51.749 --> 29:54.251
Dealing with people not
being accepting.

29:54.293 --> 29:58.339
And your crazy ass sister,
being like, "I'll hurt you."

29:58.380 --> 30:00.382
[Jane] In front of the whole
school.

30:00.424 --> 30:03.761
[Emma] I didn't mean to. It
was an accident.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.804
[Laura] What did you do?

30:09.433 --> 30:13.103
[Jane] Freshman year, one day
we had an activity where we

30:13.145 --> 30:15.105
came into this auditorium.

30:15.147 --> 30:21.570
And my therapist, my personal
therapist, came onto the stage

30:21.612 --> 30:27.117
and was basically educating
everyone about the LGBT

30:27.159 --> 30:31.205
community, but mostly about
trans wellness.

30:31.247 --> 30:36.043
And you know, all I wanted was
just to be in the shadows

30:36.085 --> 30:39.797
and not be put
in any spotlight.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.175
They only did this whole
seminar and like this whole

30:43.217 --> 30:44.802
assembly because I was being
bullied.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.805
All these seats were filled up
with all of my classmates

30:47.846 --> 30:50.808
and, you know, freshman,
sophmore, juniors, seniors.

30:50.849 --> 30:56.647
Like all the... Most of the
school was in here with me.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.691
[music playing]

31:01.860 --> 31:04.405
[Jane] Right when she started
saying, like, "Does anyone have

31:04.446 --> 31:08.242
any questions?" Like, that's
when I started losing my breath.

31:08.284 --> 31:12.246
Because I was just waiting for
someone to say something

31:12.288 --> 31:15.249
and, you know, freshmen year I
didn't want to talk about it.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.376
I didn't want to be vocal
about it. I just wanted to

31:17.418 --> 31:18.836
be a girl and nothing else.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.922
Like I didn’t want to be a part
of any conversation yet.

31:21.964 --> 31:27.970
I was only a year out, like I
was still so new to everything.

31:29.888 --> 31:33.684
One of Emma's classmates, who
was also a senior, he was a boy,

31:33.726 --> 31:37.396
said something along the lines
of, "I think it's wrong..."

31:37.438 --> 31:40.524
um, "to be trans."

31:40.566 --> 31:45.696
And, um... like I get shaky
and I'm like lightheaded

31:45.738 --> 31:47.489
talking about it right now,
but...

31:47.531 --> 31:51.869
I don't even wanna cry
it's so stupid, but...

31:51.910 --> 31:55.706
[Emma] They started saying
that it was a sin for

31:55.748 --> 32:00.878
transgender individuals to
transition into another gender.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.963
And that's when I started
getting angry.

32:03.005 --> 32:05.007
[music playing]

32:08.260 --> 32:14.099
[Jane] But yeah, he was um, he
said my name and he said um...

32:14.141 --> 32:19.897
"I know Emma's sister is trans."
and, um you know he looked at me

32:19.938 --> 32:23.901
and Emma and he was.. Which
is... you know, he can have his

32:23.942 --> 32:28.572
opinions, like I'm totally
fine what that. Like, I get it.

32:28.614 --> 32:32.910
But, you know, it just felt very
targeted and it's such a big

32:32.951 --> 32:36.455
space, it was just a lot of
pressure and I couldn't

32:36.497 --> 32:39.375
defend myself 'cause...

32:39.416 --> 32:44.338
I was just so scared to
say anything and I didn't have a

32:44.380 --> 32:46.924
voice back then.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.844
So Emma was my voice in that
situation, so I was grateful

32:50.886 --> 32:54.932
that I had her there, but um...

32:54.973 --> 32:57.935
You can have your own
beliefs. That's fine.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.938
You know, believe, like, what
you wanna believe.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.439
I'll believe what I wanna
believe.

33:02.481 --> 33:09.571
But the minute you start making
nasty comments

33:09.613 --> 33:13.367
about my family, then there’s
like, a problem.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.536
[whispered] Oh my God, I'm gonna
get emotional.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.579
Like, it made me so angry.

33:20.416 --> 33:22.960
Why is it a sin? Because
someone wants to be

33:23.001 --> 33:27.548
happy, you know? I raised my
hand and looked at him

33:27.589 --> 33:30.175
and I was like, "How dare
you!

33:30.217 --> 33:32.219
How dare you say that."

33:32.845 --> 33:34.972
How in any way does her
transition affect you?

33:35.013 --> 33:37.015
It doesn't.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.561
[Jane] I just could feel
everyone's eyes on me.

33:40.602 --> 33:43.355
Right when he said my name and
it was just everything that I

33:43.397 --> 33:47.985
didn't want, so I just felt
frozen, and I couldn't breathe

33:48.026 --> 33:52.030
or move. You know, being only
like 15, I felt like I had to

33:52.072 --> 33:56.285
just sit here and hold my
breath and

33:56.326 --> 34:02.875
wait for it to be over.
A lot of pressure.

34:02.916 --> 34:05.210
[Emma] I sat down and I kinda
like, needed to breathe,

34:05.252 --> 34:07.796
so I kinda got up and left and
I left Jane there and I was

34:07.838 --> 34:10.841
like, "You're gonna be fine."

34:10.883 --> 34:12.009
Then everyone was
staring at me.

34:12.050 --> 34:15.179
[Emma] And everyone was
like, "Yes! Yes!"

34:15.220 --> 34:18.265
[Jane] You mean everyone was
applauding for you.

34:18.307 --> 34:20.434
Everyone was
applauding for you.

34:20.476 --> 34:23.020
[Jane] Me being outed in front
of a whole auditorium is...

34:23.061 --> 34:27.691
is... doesn’t even... is so
much... doesn't even

34:27.733 --> 34:29.985
match the day to day struggles
that make

34:30.027 --> 34:32.613
being trans even harder. And
when it doesn't have to

34:32.654 --> 34:35.866
be that hard. Like shopping for
clothes. That person

34:35.908 --> 34:39.953
going into that dressing room
is... That might be their first

34:39.995 --> 34:44.833
time actually going out in
public and not doing this

34:44.875 --> 34:47.878
behind closed doors where they
feel most safe.

34:47.920 --> 34:51.590
Like, it's so noticeable when
people are judging you.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.884
[Laura] Yeah, doesn't help
when someone is saying "chicks

34:53.926 --> 34:57.012
with dicks" behind you
in the hallway.

34:57.054 --> 35:01.183
Um, but could you tell us, like,

35:01.225 --> 35:03.602
what we could have done
better.

35:03.644 --> 35:07.606
[Jane] I think you guys were
amazing in everything you did

35:07.648 --> 35:09.608
to help me and be there for me.

35:09.650 --> 35:11.652
I couldn’t have asked for
more.

35:11.693 --> 35:16.740
You know, I think you guys did
a beautiful job.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.158
[David] And your sisters?

35:18.200 --> 35:19.201
[Jane] Not so much.

35:19.243 --> 35:22.412
[laughter]

35:22.454 --> 35:25.916
- No, they were the best.
- They were the best.

35:25.958 --> 35:29.336
The first, um, prom Jane went
to,

35:29.378 --> 35:31.338
we're putting these
dresses on Jane,

35:31.380 --> 35:35.509
and Emma is getting
pissed off, because everything

35:35.551 --> 35:42.015
looks fabulous on Jane, and Emma
is like "Let me try that on!"

35:42.057 --> 35:46.937
And she's five feet tall and
she just was like...

35:46.979 --> 35:52.109
"I hate you." She's like "Put it
back on, you look better in it."

35:52.150 --> 35:53.819
That was so funny.

35:53.861 --> 35:56.947
I always looked up to
Emma.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.992
Well, you know what
honey, we look up to you.

36:00.033 --> 36:04.371
You're one of the bravest
people we know.

36:04.413 --> 36:05.372
[Jane] Stop crying.

36:05.414 --> 36:09.251
[Laura] I can't! I love you so
much.

36:09.293 --> 36:10.210
[Jane] Drink your tea.

36:10.252 --> 36:14.131
[Laura] I can't drink, I'll
cough. I'll choke.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.134
It's okay when they cry.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.052
[David] She cries over eggs.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.345
[Jane] You cry
over everything.

36:20.387 --> 36:23.348
[Laura] They were supposed to
be poached.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.142
They were hard boiled.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.854
Leave me alone. It was 20 years
ago and I was hungover.

36:28.896 --> 36:32.149
[David] She cried and we were
in a restuarant.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.152
We love each other more than
anything else. We do.

36:35.193 --> 36:39.865
We're a very close knit
family, but even in that

36:39.907 --> 36:43.160
tightness and that closeness, we
missed it.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.747
Everything you planned for,
everything you thought that

36:46.788 --> 36:52.085
your child's life would be, is
completely out the window.

36:52.127 --> 36:56.840
And you worry. You're scared.

36:57.841 --> 37:02.179
I'm so fucking lucky,
that I have my fucking parents

37:02.220 --> 37:06.183
and my family.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.394
It's just I feel bad sometimes.
Like, I feel like a burden

37:09.436 --> 37:14.191
but, I know that they love me.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.234
I'm just being emotional.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.245
[tearing paper]

37:33.251 --> 37:36.213
Hey!

37:36.254 --> 37:37.839
[Laura] What does it say?

37:37.881 --> 37:38.924
Accepted!

37:38.966 --> 37:41.635
Yay!

37:41.677 --> 37:44.471
Accepted into the School of
Visual Arts.

37:44.513 --> 37:46.556
Yay! Aww.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.225
Look at that. What
does it say?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.477
Accepted Students Day.

37:50.519 --> 37:53.814
[Jane] What I submitted for my
application to SVA, was a

37:53.855 --> 38:00.028
whole compilation of all the
films I made in high school,

38:00.070 --> 38:02.739
and I submitted that and I
wrote a whole long essay,

38:02.781 --> 38:04.950
about my journey and being
trans

38:04.992 --> 38:08.286
and wanting to work in the
film industry.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.958
[Jane] I'll get to learn what I
like to do, what I love to do.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.253
And I also want to do modeling
and acting.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.673
Like I think I wanna keep my
options open, and I dont think

38:19.715 --> 38:22.259
I wanna do just
one thing either.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.845
What I most like about
modeling is

38:24.886 --> 38:25.929
the fashion involved and,

38:25.971 --> 38:31.018
so when I’m gonna be in L.A.
there’s gonna be at least five

38:31.059 --> 38:33.562
photoshoots. I believe. I don't
know the specific numbers.

38:33.603 --> 38:36.356
And we're going to be doing
rehearsals for the show.

38:36.398 --> 38:38.734
I haven’t really
met a lot of trans girls.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.486
That would be cool.

38:44.156 --> 38:46.700
[Gabriel] This is my... This was
our bedroom.

38:46.742 --> 38:52.539
I love you. I can't ask for
better. I really can't.

38:54.541 --> 38:57.252
So this was my wife's bedroom
and my bedroom.

38:57.294 --> 39:00.630
And I had a son. I lost him in
an automobile accident.

39:00.672 --> 39:04.801
That's John. He
was 22 years old.

39:05.802 --> 39:08.305
That was my first tragedy.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.932
Losing him.

39:10.974 --> 39:15.979
I hope I make 92, I'll make 91
on the 9th of February.

39:18.899 --> 39:22.360
I don’t know why they got this
for me. I’m not gonna use it.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.782
That’s the plaque that's on the
moon.

39:26.823 --> 39:31.036
I put a little arrow right
where my name is.

39:31.078 --> 39:35.332
So I was in the aerospace
industry for about 42 years.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.710
My big project was Apollo 12.

39:38.752 --> 39:42.172
I signed the plaque which went
to the moon.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.466
That plaque is still on the
surface of the moon with my

39:44.508 --> 39:46.760
name on it.

39:46.802 --> 39:50.180
I have a lot to be thankful
for. I really do.

39:50.222 --> 39:51.348
That's it.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.016
[Laura] Dad!

39:54.392 --> 39:56.728
[Gabriel] Well, I have nothing
to complain about except

39:56.770 --> 40:01.483
losing my wife. But listen,
nobody lives forever.

40:01.525 --> 40:04.361
We were married 58 years.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.363
[Laura] Jane first came out to
her grandma.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.948
[Jane] Yeah, it was um..

40:07.989 --> 40:08.990
[Gabriel] Didn't bother her.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.283
[Laura] No.

40:10.325 --> 40:13.203
[Gabriel] We're very broad
minded.

40:13.245 --> 40:17.874
[Jane] I was in eighth grade,
when I came out to my grandma.

40:17.916 --> 40:22.087
Um, yeah, um...

40:22.129 --> 40:22.796
[Laura] You texted her.

40:22.838 --> 40:26.007
[Jane] I did, I texted her, "I
am transgender."

40:26.049 --> 40:27.801
and he picked it up.

40:27.843 --> 40:31.221
And then he said "What
is this? What?"

40:31.263 --> 40:34.182
And then I ran and took the
phone from him.

40:34.224 --> 40:37.561
And I took my grandma's hand
and I took her to her bedroom

40:37.602 --> 40:39.729
and then I was, I showed her
the text

40:39.771 --> 40:46.862
and she was like, "Okay wow"
she's like "Well at least like..

40:46.903 --> 40:49.406
...you said something." Like,"At
least you could be happy now."

40:49.447 --> 40:53.410
"And I love you." And she
was just really there for me.

40:53.451 --> 40:59.416
And then the next day I told you
and the day after that I told

40:59.457 --> 41:00.834
everyone else, so...

41:00.876 --> 41:06.506
[Laura] And I blamed Caitlyn
Jenner and I said,

41:06.548 --> 41:07.966
"Stop watching that show!"

41:08.008 --> 41:09.885
But she didn't even know
what it meant.

41:09.926 --> 41:14.264
She thought I was transvestite.

41:14.306 --> 41:16.183
No, you mean<i> </i>Tayta?

41:16.224 --> 41:17.142
Yeah,<i> </i>Tayta thought
that.

41:17.184 --> 41:20.312
Tayta was like, "Just wear
the clothes in the house.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.438
Nobody has to know."

41:21.479 --> 41:24.107
"Just wear the girl clothes in
the house. Shhh!"

41:24.149 --> 41:26.943
"Don't worry. Lots of guys do
that. It's okay."

41:26.985 --> 41:29.446
We knew. We knew
something was bothering her.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.407
But she still wouldn't talk
about it and we didn't wanna

41:32.449 --> 41:34.701
pressure her into it or corner
her.

41:34.743 --> 41:36.620
[Jane] I was just struggling
'cause I didn’t know anything.

41:36.661 --> 41:40.081
I was, like, lost. I was just so
uneducated about everything.

41:40.123 --> 41:42.209
Right, well we all were.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.418
Yeah, I didn't know
trans was a thing.

41:43.460 --> 41:46.296
[David] When Jane first came
out to the family it was a...

41:46.338 --> 41:50.467
...Orthodox, cause<i> </i>Jidu is
Syrian Orthodox.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.887
And it was an Orthodox Easter
and Jane showed up and she was

41:53.929 --> 41:56.306
stunning. She had her makeup
on. She had high heels. She had

41:56.348 --> 41:57.474
a beautiful dress on.

41:57.515 --> 42:01.770
But our families in Brooklyn
growing up, all of them

42:01.811 --> 42:06.775
very, very close knit. Very
tight. Um, if I had to tell you

42:06.816 --> 42:09.402
where they stood on
a political range

42:09.444 --> 42:12.489
I would say everybody is right
in the middle.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.699
The majority of people are
right in the middle.

42:14.741 --> 42:18.078
They might lean right, but
everybody's in the middle.

42:18.119 --> 42:22.040
And for the family to have
never seen her before...

42:22.082 --> 42:23.667
...they had heard, now.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.877
We had told everybody.

42:25.919 --> 42:28.129
But to see her and to see the
look on everybody.

42:28.171 --> 42:31.925
And how everybody swarmed her
and embraced her and hugged her.

42:31.967 --> 42:34.135
And just the tears that were
in that room.

42:34.177 --> 42:37.264
And I'm talking about, you
know, 60 people.

42:37.305 --> 42:42.102
[Laura] I think I called every
gay cousin I had.

42:42.143 --> 42:44.521
And they were like "Oh that's
beautiful."

42:44.562 --> 42:47.941
I'm like, "What do I do?" "What
do I do?" "What do I say?"

42:47.983 --> 42:51.278
"What do I say?" "Tell me what
not to say."

42:51.319 --> 42:55.532
It was a scary time. I mean we
were just scared for you.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.242
You know? "What if she changes
her mind,

42:57.284 --> 42:58.702
this is just a phase?"

42:58.743 --> 43:03.248
You know? Like just all these
things go through your mind.

43:03.290 --> 43:07.544
Who's gonna follow her into a
parking lot and beat the crap

43:07.585 --> 43:10.922
out of her? You know?

43:10.964 --> 43:14.551
Those are real things that
happen everyday.

43:14.592 --> 43:18.179
And you're scared to, you know?
And I can't follow you

43:18.221 --> 43:20.557
to school everyday.

43:20.598 --> 43:24.853
[Laura] From a parent's view
and I've seen it firsthand that,

43:24.894 --> 43:29.190
um, parents make it about
themselves and not their

43:29.232 --> 43:31.860
children. And, uh, I think you
have to

43:31.901 --> 43:36.573
take a step to the side and
realize

43:36.614 --> 43:40.452
it's not about you and it's
about somebody else's

43:40.493 --> 43:42.579
happiness.

43:42.620 --> 43:48.585
As a mom who has struggled
seeing the unhappiness in their

43:48.626 --> 43:50.628
child...

43:54.632 --> 43:57.427
Worrying about suicide.

43:57.469 --> 44:04.351
Going to bed wondering if I’m
gonna wake up to a child

44:04.392 --> 44:07.312
who is not with us anymore.

44:07.354 --> 44:12.817
And then like, just finally
coming to that breaking point

44:12.859 --> 44:16.446
where she comes out.

44:16.488 --> 44:19.491
And it's just... it's almost
like um...

44:19.532 --> 44:25.038
...a weight coming off of all
of us.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.623
[David] And then everyone
would tell us, you know,

44:26.664 --> 44:28.750
"Jane is lucky to have you guys
as parents,"

44:28.792 --> 44:30.627
and I'm just saying well...

44:30.668 --> 44:33.713
We're lucky to have... we're
lucky to be Jane's parents.

44:33.755 --> 44:38.385
Nobody is exceptional for
loving your kid.

44:38.426 --> 44:42.430
We're not exceptional. Jane,
you’re exceptional.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.225
[Laura] I want her to have it
all.

44:45.266 --> 44:47.685
And she's gonna have it all.

44:47.727 --> 44:49.771
Within time, she's gonna
have it all.

44:49.813 --> 44:52.690
She's gonna have everything
she wants.

44:53.525 --> 44:56.027
[Jane] I think my mom has
always wanted to support me

44:56.069 --> 44:58.530
and really pushed me to do
better.

44:58.571 --> 45:03.660
Because coming out I was very
shy. I was very closed off.

45:03.701 --> 45:07.163
And I wasn't very confident
and she always noticed the

45:07.205 --> 45:10.083
things I picked up on and things
that I was interested in.

45:10.125 --> 45:12.502
So for her, like, putting me in
a competition.

45:12.544 --> 45:14.963
Like, I would never be able to
do that myself.

45:15.004 --> 45:16.673
[music playing]

45:16.714 --> 45:19.676
[Jane] Today's the day!

45:19.717 --> 45:22.720
We're going to L.A.!

45:25.181 --> 45:29.102
I can’t wait. I just
wanna have a lot of fun.

45:29.144 --> 45:31.688
[Laura] She's always been
excited about L.A.

45:31.729 --> 45:34.732
Even before all of this. She
always said she wanted to live

45:34.774 --> 45:35.984
in L.A.

45:36.025 --> 45:39.529
I'm like, "Do you even know
where L.A. is?"

45:39.571 --> 45:43.575
I mean, like, who get to do
this? Not many people.

45:46.786 --> 45:49.789
[music playing]
