00:42.160 --> 00:46.073
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

00:46.160 --> 00:48.833
Never let it fade away!

00:50.080 --> 00:53.550
Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

00:53.640 --> 00:56.473
You know
how some movies have
a dream sequence,

00:56.560 --> 00:59.438
only they don't
tell you it's a dream?

00:59.520 --> 01:02.353
This is so not a dream.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.318
It wasn't
supposed to be like this.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.237
I was just
trying to do my job,
and then things happened.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.197
My life happened.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.311
And now I'm here.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.628
Trust me,
I'm not the kind of girl
who does things like this.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.710
Two months ago,
you couldn't have picked me
out of a crowd.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.869
Hi. Call me.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.555
Told you. I'm over there.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.992
I was the youngest copy editor
at the Chicago Sun-Times.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.149
Josie.
Hello.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.434
"Theater"?

01:41.520 --> 01:43.272
Standard American
calls for E-R.

01:43.360 --> 01:46.875
Standard British, R-E.
So, unless you're

01:47.000 --> 01:48.513
a pompous American,
I would go with E-R.

01:48.600 --> 01:52.195
I had my own office,
unlimited stationery supplies

01:52.280 --> 01:54.236
and a dedicated assistant.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.197
How about this
awesome new phrase,

01:56.280 --> 01:59.113
"Power is powerful."
Total T -shirt, right?

01:59.200 --> 02:00.155
Amazing. what?

02:00.240 --> 02:01.229
Can I get my messages?

02:01.320 --> 02:02.389
Yeah.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.517
Hey, seriously,
last time I saw you,
did I look fat?

02:05.600 --> 02:08.193
OK, you hesitated.
No, it's case-closed.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.716
Excuse me, Merkin,
there aren't any index cards,

02:11.800 --> 02:13.472
so I can't do my notes...

02:13.560 --> 02:17.633
Hey, hey,
hey, Merkin ain't jerkin'.
He's workin'. OK?

02:17.720 --> 02:20.393
Take that to the bank.
It's power, baby.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.676
Yeah, my boss.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.197
I'm just a little tense.
This office is not feng shui.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.317
All the desks are facing,
like, evil, you know?

02:31.400 --> 02:34.153
Do you think
I should bleach my teeth?

02:34.240 --> 02:35.639
Some sunshine
around the mouth?

02:35.720 --> 02:39.759
Or maybe I should
just laser my gums.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.590
Josie! Guess who I
did it with last night.

02:45.680 --> 02:47.159
Roger from Op-Ed?

02:47.240 --> 02:48.832
Ah! who told you?

02:48.920 --> 02:50.797
You said yesterday,

02:50.880 --> 02:54.270
"I have a date with
Roger from Op-Ed tonight,

02:54.400 --> 02:56.311
"and I'm gonna do it
with him."

02:56.400 --> 02:59.153
Septuplet story.
I need it by five.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.349
Hopefully,
the copy's not a mess.

03:00.440 --> 03:04.672
"It's hoped that
it's not a mess."
"Hopefully" means "with hope".

03:04.760 --> 03:06.591
You have it
defining the copy, and I'm

03:06.680 --> 03:09.035
pretty sure the copy
doesn't have feelings.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.348
Hm.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.269
So, Anita,
you and Roger in Op-Ed.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.349
Oh, man, who told you?

03:14.440 --> 03:15.873
Roger.
Really?

03:15.960 --> 03:18.554
Don't make me
send you another memo

03:18.640 --> 03:20.517
about my policy on
interoffice dating.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.670
It's intra-office dating.

03:22.760 --> 03:25.638
And they're not dating.
They're having sex.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.399
Oh.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.914
And what exactly is
your policy, Augustus?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.515
That if you're
not getting any,
then no one can? Hm.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.679
How many times
have I fired her?
Five or six.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.111
Eight.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.232
Gus,
did you get those story ideas
that I left on your desk?

03:45.320 --> 03:48.437
Morning, Mr. Strauss.
The blind foster-home mother.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.670
That was good.
I got Cahoon on it.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.716
Oh, yeah, Cahoon. He's good.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.679
Geller,
we've been through this.
You're a great copy editor.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.274
Maybe my best copy editor.
You're not a reporter.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.955
You've used five of my ideas.
Gus, please.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.235
Everyone thinks he can write,

04:05.320 --> 04:08.835
but a journalist
gets in there, where the
bombs are falling.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.077
He's aggressive.
He grabs
the bull by the balls.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.276
You don't think I can
grab a bull's balls?

04:14.360 --> 04:18.478
You don't want
a reporter's life.
Trust me. They're very messy.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.392
And you're all
about order and control

04:21.480 --> 04:23.755
and getting me
my copy by five.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.673
I can be out of control.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.315
Copy by five!

04:39.800 --> 04:42.473
Josie, maybe Gus has a point.

04:42.560 --> 04:45.791
It's not gonna kill you
to relax and have some fun.

04:45.880 --> 04:49.111
Hey, Roger's got this friend,
Marshall, in editing.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.668
Maybe we could all
go on a double date.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.956
Marshall, "the Duke"?

04:54.040 --> 04:55.792
I swear to God,
Josie, come on.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.872
Tell me, when is the last time
you went on a real date?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.230
I'm concentrating
on my career now.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.750
Do you own any
colored underwear?
Stripes or anything?

05:06.880 --> 05:09.792
The right guy's out there.
I'm just not gonna

05:09.880 --> 05:12.997
go kiss a whole bunch
of losers to get to him.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.789
Yeah, but sometimes
kissing the losers
can be a really fun diversion.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.399
Mm-hm!

05:18.480 --> 05:21.995
when I finally get kissed,
I'll know.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.629
If you've never kissed a guy,
we have bigger problems
than underwear.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.751
I've kissed a guy.

05:29.120 --> 05:34.148
I've kissed guys.
I just haven't
felt that thing.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.676
"That thing"?
Is that what you kids
are calling it these days?

05:39.080 --> 05:42.755
That thing. That moment
when you kiss someone

05:42.840 --> 05:46.833
and everything
around you becomes hazy.

05:46.920 --> 05:50.310
And the only thing in focus
is you and this person.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.675
And you realize that
that person is the only person

05:55.760 --> 05:59.070
that you're supposed to kiss
for the rest of your life.

05:59.960 --> 06:04.636
And for one moment
you get this amazing gift.

06:04.760 --> 06:08.116
And you wanna laugh
and you wanna cry...

06:09.600 --> 06:12.353
cos you feel so
lucky that you found it

06:12.440 --> 06:17.116
and so scared
that it'll go away,
all at the same time.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.713
Damn, girl. You are a writer.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.914
OK, I'm finished.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.438
what do you guys think?
where do you
think it should go?

06:47.280 --> 06:50.829
In the bedroom?
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.669
Perfect.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.112
The meeting just began.
Let me start by saying

07:16.200 --> 07:19.954
I was very impressed with
that investigative piece

07:20.040 --> 07:23.555
that Dutton did on pesticides
in our supermarkets.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.148
But since
the Trib did a piece on

07:26.240 --> 07:29.676
the same subject,
only better, you're fired.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.359
Huh?

07:31.440 --> 07:33.829
Dutton, did you hear me?
You're fired. Out.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.992
Close your cubicle.
Bye-bye, Dutton.

07:37.080 --> 07:40.038
Hello, everybody
else still working here.

07:40.120 --> 07:45.911
Let's celebrate by doing
another undercover feature!

07:46.000 --> 07:49.879
Now,
you know that my inspiration
for these stories comes,

07:50.080 --> 07:52.310
of course,
from my personal life.

07:52.400 --> 07:57.190
I mean, who would
have thought that my foray
into the hair plugs

07:57.400 --> 08:00.119
would have resulted in
last month's cover story?

08:00.200 --> 08:04.796
"Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow."
A great story.

08:04.920 --> 08:08.276
Last night I'm sitting home
with my family,
having dinner...

08:08.360 --> 08:10.032
Roger.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.395
..and my younger
boy starts to choke!

08:12.480 --> 08:16.712
Then I realized my son
was allergic to peanuts.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.711
I said to myself,

08:18.800 --> 08:23.078
"Holy shit! I don't
even know my own kids."

08:23.160 --> 08:24.991
"How much do we
know about these

08:25.080 --> 08:27.469
"high-school kids?
what are they thinking?"

08:27.680 --> 08:30.274
And then it hit me.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.998
Boom!

08:33.280 --> 08:36.635
"My Semester in High School."

08:36.720 --> 08:39.280
You. what's your name?

08:40.240 --> 08:41.639
J... J... Josie.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.995
José?
Josie Geller.

08:44.360 --> 08:48.239
Josie Geller,
you enroll Friday! Have fun!

08:48.320 --> 08:50.788
The meeting just ended.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.269
Josie. Josie!

08:54.360 --> 08:57.670
..20-minute handstand.
Freaked the yogi right out.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.751
Excuse me.

09:01.640 --> 09:02.675
Josie...

09:02.760 --> 09:06.594
Uh... It's really happening!

09:06.680 --> 09:10.389
"My first undercover feature,
by Josie Geller"!

09:10.480 --> 09:12.914
Josie, maybe you
should turn it down.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.911
why?
You don't think I can do it?

09:15.000 --> 09:19.152
No! It's just,
this is a lot of pressure
for your first piece.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.231
This is not
a half-a-page article.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.993
This is a major
undercover piece.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.356
Look what Rigfort
just did to Dutton,
and he's his cousin.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.477
Don't worry. I'm gonna
straighten this all out.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.357
You guys don't
think I can do this?

09:32.440 --> 09:34.192
we're not saying that.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.999
when you wanted to seduce
the mailroom guy,

09:37.080 --> 09:38.911
and you thought
you couldn't learn Spanish,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.991
who quizzed you
on your verbs?

09:41.720 --> 09:42.948
Señorita Josie.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.395
Gus, when you wanted
to learn how to knit,

09:45.520 --> 09:47.750
who showed you how
to work the needles?

09:47.840 --> 09:49.512
You did.
You knit?

09:49.720 --> 09:51.472
Yeah.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.719
So this is my chance.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.833
I'm not holding your
job for you, Geller.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.035
Thank you!

10:04.120 --> 10:05.189
OK...

10:06.200 --> 10:09.510
Don't make me give you
my memo on
interoffice hugging.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.716
Now comes the hard part.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.674
Oh, my gosh.
You get to be 1 7 again.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.076
wow.
OK, what's the first thing
you're gonna need?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.956
You want Bambi? No way.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.713
Rob, please.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.199
why don't you just
borrow Mom's car?

10:26.560 --> 10:28.949
I can't use a minivan.
I need a cheap car.

10:30.040 --> 10:34.477
A vintage classic.
It's just for
a couple of months.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.075
A couple of months is like
ten years in Bambi life.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.720
It's so weird that
you name your cars.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.791
why? Guys name their penises.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.391
OK...

10:46.480 --> 10:52.749
You can have
my Buick LeSabre and name it
anything you want.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.836
Really?

10:54.920 --> 10:56.239
LeSabre.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.878
Nah, I don't think so.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.758
Fully loaded.
Maybe.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.955
wow, are those
shorts or a skirt?

11:05.040 --> 11:08.191
They're gaucho pants.
I got them on sale.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.636
Aloha. welcome!
Every customer
gets a free lei.

11:11.760 --> 11:15.150
Relax, Monty.
It's just my sister.
Aloha, my ass.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.832
Shake it easy, buddy.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.388
Have you talked to
the admissions lady

11:19.480 --> 11:21.436
from Lakeshore
Community College yet?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.875
No.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.520
But you could start
before next semester,

11:26.600 --> 11:28.750
talk to her about
a baseball scholarship.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.195
It's too late,
Josie, you know?

11:31.280 --> 11:35.512
I'm not going to college.
I'm not playing
baseball anymore.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.636
This is my life.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.836
This is a luau that
sells packing material.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.838
You had such a shot
at playing college ball.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.713
You let one case
of mono stop you.

11:51.800 --> 11:55.349
Don't you want to move
out of Mom and Dad's?
Pay your own bills?

11:55.440 --> 11:58.034
why?
So I can be as happy as you?

11:58.240 --> 12:03.633
I am happy.
Besides, you are looking at

12:03.720 --> 12:08.111
the newest
undercover reporter
for the Chicago Sun-Times.

12:08.200 --> 12:12.432
I am Josie Geller,
high-school student,
senior class 1 999.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.313
Uh-uh.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.835
You're kidding, right?
what?

12:19.120 --> 12:21.759
Josie, do you
remember high school?

12:21.840 --> 12:23.034
It was a long time ago.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.391
Do you remember what
they called you
in high school?

12:26.480 --> 12:31.759
..Grossie! Josie Grossie!
Josie Grossie! Josie...

12:35.320 --> 12:37.914
Josie Grossie.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.434
I know. I made it up.

12:40.520 --> 12:44.752
I didn't know it was gonna
catch on like it did.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.832
Oh, Josie, what's the matter?
You look nauseous.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.639
Nauseated. I look nauseated.

13:33.720 --> 13:38.157
Hi, Billy. I noticed
that you weren't in
math class today,

13:38.240 --> 13:41.915
so, um, I decided to take
some notes for you.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.835
This is a very bad idea.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.552
It's only in your dreams

14:11.680 --> 14:14.752
But it felt like it was real

14:18.120 --> 14:20.111
You're only

14:21.320 --> 14:23.675
You're only seventeen

14:24.480 --> 14:26.550
You're only

14:27.640 --> 14:31.030
You're only seventeen

14:31.120 --> 14:32.997
You're only

14:33.960 --> 14:37.111
You're only seventeen

15:04.840 --> 15:07.274
Hey, feeling good.

15:11.240 --> 15:15.392
"My name is Josie. I'm from
Scranton, Pennsylvania,
the Keystone State."

15:15.480 --> 15:17.755
Hold it.
where are you going?

15:17.840 --> 15:20.798
To high school, because
I'm a high-school student.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.998
I'm here with my
fellow students.
Hey, guys. Hi.

15:30.080 --> 15:35.677
Beeper, appears legitimate.
Computer organizer.
Recording device.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.398
I can
grab bulls' balls.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.277
Appears legitimate.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.476
This is
a projectile launcher.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.151
That's a weapon.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.118
Class, today we have
the pleasure of exploring

16:05.400 --> 16:08.153
the pantheistic culture
of India. India...

16:12.240 --> 16:16.028
Hi, hello.
willkommen! Entrez, entrez.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.071
I'm sorry I'm late.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.630
well, I'm sorry
I forgot to take my
hot flash medication today.

16:22.720 --> 16:27.589
Please sit. Josie, right.
Mi casa es su casa.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.637
That is so sad.

16:29.720 --> 16:33.315
I know. Five chickens
had to die just so she
could look stupid.

16:33.720 --> 16:37.349
Josie, in my classroom,
tardiness is unacceptable.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.953
I'm sorry.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.395
Not as sorry as I am.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.989
Olé!

16:46.080 --> 16:48.594
Ten minutes in that,
you'll never be late again.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.069
So let's hear
something about you.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.310
Stand up. Stand up.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.639
My name is Josie Geller.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.757
I'm a high-school student.
I'm from...

17:07.119 --> 17:08.712
Billy?

17:12.599 --> 17:16.512
Excuse me?
You live in "Billy"?

17:16.599 --> 17:19.194
B-Bali. Uh, Billy-Bali.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.550
Um, it's a suburb
of Bali proper.

17:22.640 --> 17:26.315
Bali?
The island nation of Bali.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.477
Fascinating. what did
your family do there?

17:30.440 --> 17:34.479
Um, we were sheep...
Sheep farmers.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.275
My family raised sheep.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.878
Note to self: research Bali.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.472
Kill Anita for
picking out this outfit.
Find and destroy sombrero.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.590
we sit here.
Yeah.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.274
I'm sorry. I didn't
know they were assigned.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.351
They're not.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.472
Morning, everyone.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.596
Morning.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.672
I don't think we've met.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.271
I'm Sam... Coulson.

18:18.360 --> 18:21.352
The school has a thing about
letting you guys call me Sam.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.591
I'm Josie. But I'm
pretty sure the school

18:24.680 --> 18:26.557
would be OK with
you calling me that.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.995
welcome to Shakespeare's
As You Like It.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.071
As You Like It...
we can share.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.434
..is an example of
Shakespearean...

18:32.520 --> 18:35.114
Thank you.

18:35.200 --> 18:40.797
..pastoral comedy.
Now, does anyone know
what that means?

18:40.880 --> 18:42.950
Yeah, that's what
they do to milk.

18:43.040 --> 18:47.272
No, Sera,
that's "pasteurize".
But it's close.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.476
Parakeet?

18:49.560 --> 18:51.551
OK, anyone else?

18:54.880 --> 18:56.359
Josie.

18:56.440 --> 18:57.793
"Pastoral" means
set in the country,

18:57.880 --> 19:00.678
originally seen in
the Eclogues of Virgil.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.513
It's from
the Latin "pascere",
"to graze".

19:10.480 --> 19:12.471
Are you sure you're 17?

19:12.560 --> 19:15.791
Yes. I'm 17.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.395
I'm 17. Of course.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.037
Excuse me.
what's in the coleslaw?

19:39.720 --> 19:41.517
Thank you.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.753
Leave.

19:43.840 --> 19:47.310
Kirsten,
that bran muffin has,
like, 75 grams of fat.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.674
Nah-uh.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.069
Did I tell you that
Lisa has hemorrhoids?

19:51.160 --> 19:52.991
Shot right up.
Hi.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.513
Hi, Kristen.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.919
It's Kirsten.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.477
Oh. OK.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.119
Oh!

20:04.840 --> 20:09.994
well, that'll teach me
to wear white jeans
after Labor Day.

20:10.880 --> 20:14.475
I don't think you're supposed
to wear white
jeans after 1983.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.798
Right. Right, right.

20:19.960 --> 20:25.080
OK, so, like, what are
you guys' hopes and dreams?

20:25.200 --> 20:27.555
Any interests?

20:27.640 --> 20:29.676
Hi. I'm Guy.

20:30.680 --> 20:36.630
Hi. Yes, you are a guy.
Quite a guy.

20:38.040 --> 20:41.476
Oh, my. That rhymes.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.273
Yikes. Bikes!

20:49.480 --> 20:51.516
Are you in special ed?

20:53.120 --> 20:55.236
I mean, are you?

20:55.320 --> 20:56.878
I can't believe
he just said that.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.712
He just said that.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.791
I'm just gonna go.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.835
Don't slip, honey.

21:04.920 --> 21:05.989
Off the chart.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.112
How old am I?

21:09.200 --> 21:13.512
Oh, approximately
6,350 days old.

21:13.600 --> 21:17.309
Now, that's subject
for adjustment for
month of birth.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.109
OK, OK, thank you.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.678
Hustle, hustle!
Come on, girls!

21:27.760 --> 21:29.796
Geller, move it!
Pick up your feet!

21:29.880 --> 21:33.031
Come on! A little
more commitment, Geller!

21:33.120 --> 21:35.873
Move it! Come on!
what is...

21:36.000 --> 21:39.629
Must have water.
what do I look like?
A waitress?

21:39.720 --> 21:42.917
Now complete these sprints.
If you don't, you fail.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.709
And if you fail gym,
you're never
getting into college.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.473
You guys are still
telling that lie?

21:49.560 --> 21:52.677
That does it, Geller.
Drop, give me 20.
No...

21:55.040 --> 21:58.032
Don't worry, Rob.
I put premium gasoline
in her.

21:58.120 --> 22:01.556
Josie, I told you Bambi's
a cheap, regular girl.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.472
wait a second.
what?

22:04.560 --> 22:08.155
I'll call you later.
Josie... Don't hang up!

22:09.440 --> 22:11.510
They do it to
all the new kids.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.232
who's "they"?

22:13.400 --> 22:15.834
Guy Perkins and
his amazing lemmings.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.433
They push your car
out of its space,

22:17.520 --> 22:20.114
hide it and watch
while you look for it.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.317
I'm Aldys.
I'm Josie.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.071
Aldys.
That's an interesting name.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.760
when it's not yours.
My mom was going

22:30.840 --> 22:33.673
through her
Harlequin Romance phase.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.557
Tell me about it.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.200
Try being named after
a guitar-playing pussycat.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.952
Never mind.

22:42.040 --> 22:45.828
would you like
to walk to Na-Na's
and get something to eat?

22:49.120 --> 22:52.396
Yeah.
That would be really nice.

22:53.280 --> 22:57.717
So, tell me, what are your
hopes and your dreams?
what do you wanna be?

22:57.800 --> 22:59.199
Thank you.
Thank you.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.671
I wanna be a professor
of medieval literature.
I wanna be a novelist.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.911
I wanna be
a weekend flutist,
a potter, a painter.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.790
I wanna be an architect
and I wanna go
to Northwestern.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.108
I went there!

23:13.200 --> 23:14.349
For what?

23:14.440 --> 23:17.910
Um... Yes, once.
To use the bathroom.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.793
Um... They had
a really nice facility.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.628
Oh, my God.

23:35.960 --> 23:36.949
Hello?

23:37.960 --> 23:40.713
what the hell kind of story
are you pitching?

23:41.800 --> 23:44.678
It's my dad. He worries.
Yeah, mine too.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.796
Hi, Dad. I miss you, too.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.791
You are one
sick puppy, Geller.

23:48.880 --> 23:52.589
It's an exposé on
cafeteria food.
Let me guess.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.750
"The Terrible
Truth About Coleslaw."

23:54.840 --> 23:57.274
The bulk of it will be
about the pimento loaf.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.271
Geller,
you wanna be a reporter?

23:59.360 --> 24:02.432
Take a look at what sells:
sex scandals,

24:02.520 --> 24:05.273
bribery,
people jumping off buildings.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.874
So unless a kid
killed himself cos
he was being paid

24:07.960 --> 24:09.473
to have sex with
the school mascot

24:09.560 --> 24:12.120
in a vat of coleslaw,
you got nothing.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.032
Call me when you do.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.238
They love to
disconnect the battery, too.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.434
Here.
Thanks.

24:28.520 --> 24:34.470
Just so that you know,
I think they recalled
these cars in 1 974.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.551
Yeah, thanks.

24:36.640 --> 24:40.189
Sure, no problem. Josie?
Yeah?

24:40.280 --> 24:43.875
I was wondering,
how are you at calculus?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.353
I'm good.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.510
would you like to
join the Denominators?

24:48.880 --> 24:50.836
we have these fun
pizza study groups

24:50.920 --> 24:52.876
and go to these
all-county meets.

24:52.960 --> 24:56.157
And I don't wanna sound
like the Godfather,

24:56.240 --> 24:59.232
but we could offer
you a certain amount
of protection,

24:59.320 --> 25:01.151
if you know what I mean.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.917
That sounds great.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.510
3x10 is 30

25:08.600 --> 25:10.716
3x9 is 27

25:10.800 --> 25:12.950
3x8 is 24

25:13.040 --> 25:15.076
3x7 is 21

25:15.200 --> 25:17.191
3x6 is 18

25:17.280 --> 25:19.396
3x5 is 1 5

25:19.480 --> 25:21.198
3x4 is 12

25:21.280 --> 25:22.872
And 3x3 is 9

25:23.000 --> 25:25.309
And 3x2 is 6

25:25.400 --> 25:28.358
And 3x1 is 3 of course

25:28.440 --> 25:30.829
Now dig the pattern
once more!

25:30.920 --> 25:33.559
3, 6, 9,

25:50.640 --> 25:54.997
"All the world's a stage,
And all the men and
women merely players."

25:55.080 --> 25:57.913
Does anyone know what
Shakespeare meant by that?

25:58.960 --> 26:00.712
Anyone?

26:00.800 --> 26:04.076
It's about disguise,
about playing a part.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.310
And that's the theme of
As You Like It.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.834
Now, does anyone know
where we can see this?

26:09.160 --> 26:11.833
Rosalind disguises
herself as a man,

26:11.920 --> 26:13.399
and then escapes
into the forest.

26:13.480 --> 26:18.031
Right. when she's in costume,
she can finally express
her love for Orlando.

26:18.120 --> 26:22.910
Shakespeare's point is that
when we're in disguise,
we feel freer.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.231
we do things we wouldn't do
in ordinary life.

26:26.320 --> 26:31.235
Brett, what happens when
you go out on the football
field in uniform?

26:31.360 --> 26:32.713
we kick ass!

26:32.800 --> 26:36.759
You yell, you hit people.
You touch other guys' butts.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.996
It's OK,
cos you're in uniform.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.350
See, disguise
changes all the rules.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.916
Tell you a story.
My first season
of peewee hockey...

26:48.360 --> 26:52.035
well,
honestly, I was terrible.
I couldn't skate.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.917
I was afraid to take a hit.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.638
And my dad one day
bought me this

26:55.720 --> 26:59.395
brand-new helmet,
signed by Gordie Howe.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.349
Come on, guys. Gordie Howe!

27:06.120 --> 27:09.635
OK, he was like
the Tiger woods of hockey.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.035
Oh. All right.

27:12.120 --> 27:15.032
Every time I put
on this helmet,
I feel invincible.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.951
Suddenly, I skate harder.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.473
I check people
left and right.

27:18.560 --> 27:22.314
I even got thrown out of
a game once for fighting.

27:22.400 --> 27:26.473
The point here is that
disguise can be liberating,

27:26.560 --> 27:30.439
can get you
to do things that you
never thought possible.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.795
And for Rosalind,
her male costume

27:32.920 --> 27:36.276
opens the possibilities for
the great love of her life.

27:37.800 --> 27:42.078
Josie, why don't you read
act five, scene two,
Rosalind's speech?

27:50.280 --> 27:53.636
"No sooner they met,
but they looked.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.996
"No sooner they looked,
but they loved.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.150
"No sooner loved,
but they sighed.

27:59.280 --> 28:02.829
"Does he notice me?

28:02.920 --> 28:05.673
"Does he hear my heart
screaming his name?

28:07.440 --> 28:11.752
"Sometimes it's so loud
I think that the gods
can hear my pain.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.273
"His voice
is so mellifluous.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.393
"If I could get
just one kiss."

28:28.280 --> 28:30.840
what have you
wanted for, like, ever,

28:30.920 --> 28:33.639
but never,
ever thought would happen?

28:33.720 --> 28:36.280
I'm the most
popular girl in school

28:36.400 --> 28:38.550
and Billy Prince is
asking me to the prom.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.519
Yes.
what?

28:42.760 --> 28:46.719
Billy Prince is
asking you to the prom.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.870
why?

28:48.960 --> 28:50.951
I don't know.

28:52.360 --> 28:57.354
The poem.
I knew he'd like the poem!

28:57.440 --> 28:59.670
Billy Prince is
asking me to the prom?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.392
That's what I'm saying.

29:06.920 --> 29:11.232
Oh, my God! I'm...
I'm actually speechless!

29:11.320 --> 29:14.471
I have no words!
That's never happened to me!

29:14.560 --> 29:16.516
words are my life!

29:19.640 --> 29:23.269
Just a reminder,
your papers are due
next week.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.797
This is Sydney,
student body president.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.758
No going to the library.
There's an asbestos problem.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.637
Can I get into my locker?

29:34.720 --> 29:38.315
Now the prom.
Voting on the prom theme
is complete,

29:38.400 --> 29:42.518
and the theme is...
"the Millennium"!

29:47.200 --> 29:50.158
The prom is
going to be rufus.
what's "rufus"?

29:50.240 --> 29:53.789
It's my new, cool,
hip word. Spread it
around like wildfire.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.757
Rufus!

29:56.840 --> 29:59.638
what is it with
this school and prom?

29:59.720 --> 30:02.678
South Glen South competes
every year for best prom.

30:02.760 --> 30:07.231
The theme is everything,
so whatever we pick

30:07.320 --> 30:08.309
has to be totally unique.

30:11.560 --> 30:14.233
There's a land that I see

30:14.680 --> 30:17.478
where the children are free

30:17.920 --> 30:20.878
Come with me, take my hand

30:20.960 --> 30:23.713
And we'll live

30:23.840 --> 30:27.037
In a land where
the river runs free

30:27.120 --> 30:30.078
In a land to a shining sea

30:30.360 --> 30:35.195
And we'll be free
to be you and me

30:35.600 --> 30:36.669
what's that?

30:36.760 --> 30:38.751
The old drive-in.
The Court.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.752
It's just a continuous
party for Guy's group.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.599
Hey.

30:44.040 --> 30:47.510
Alpo, the dog park
is that way.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.113
Go.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.878
Last I checked,
this was a free country.

30:50.960 --> 30:54.350
You're not seriously trying
to hang out at the Court.

30:54.440 --> 30:58.228
Cheap wine coolers
and a fire in a trash can.
where do I sign up?

30:58.320 --> 31:01.676
why don't you go home,
fickle around
on your calculator,

31:01.760 --> 31:02.954
whatever you do,

31:03.040 --> 31:04.519
and figure out
how many lifetimes

31:04.600 --> 31:06.955
it's gonna take
you to get cool, OK?

31:12.960 --> 31:16.236
Have you ever wanted
to go to the Court?

31:16.800 --> 31:20.076
Are you kidding, Josie?
It's lame.

31:20.160 --> 31:24.199
All they do is stand around
and get drunk. It's lame.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.794
Yeah, it seems lame.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.318
Yeah. It's very lame.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.118
You said that.

31:36.160 --> 31:39.709
The Court?
Josie, I am appalled.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.679
Geez, I know. I mean, who'd
have known that these kids...

31:44.480 --> 31:50.316
No! I am appalled because
I have a reporter in
there undercover,

31:50.400 --> 31:53.710
for three weeks,
and I had to read
about this in the Trib.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.791
You're right.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.711
No, fold...

32:01.120 --> 32:04.271
"17-year-old
Kristin Davis says

32:04.400 --> 32:10.430
"'Yeah, everyone who's anyone
is at the Court on
Saturday night.'"

32:10.520 --> 32:15.150
She's right. I have learned
that it is a popular place
for the kids to go.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.993
This is where
the stories are.

32:24.240 --> 32:27.710
You will become
friends with these people.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.798
You will party with them.
You'll rave with them.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.359
You'll get jiggy with them.

32:32.480 --> 32:36.268
when they go to the prom,
you'll be in
the same damn limo!

32:36.360 --> 32:38.351
Gus, listen.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.952
The popular kids and I...

32:44.200 --> 32:46.555
Do you even know these kids?

32:46.640 --> 32:48.119
They hid my car.

32:48.560 --> 32:52.109
Get to know them, very well!

32:52.240 --> 32:56.153
Your job, and my job,
depends on it!

32:57.000 --> 33:00.310
Um, by the way,
it's "depend" because
there's no S.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.233
Your subject is plural.
Out!

33:08.080 --> 33:11.914
Come on! Asses and elbows!
The news doesn't sleep,
you know!

33:12.000 --> 33:15.834
A high hopper to
third base, but...

33:15.920 --> 33:19.833
Yeah, baby! Mm! whoo!

33:19.920 --> 33:25.040
Rob! You're making a mess.
Can you do this
at Mom and Dad's?

33:25.120 --> 33:28.749
No, it's their turn
to do the Franklin Mint
potluck dinner.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.717
But I made a pizza.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.791
I can't do it.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.876
what?

33:35.960 --> 33:39.191
Damn! These are
high-school girls?

33:39.280 --> 33:42.431
we got some underage hotties
on our hands here.

33:42.600 --> 33:46.036
Gus wants me to be friends
with them, the popular kids.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.395
It's impossible.
why?

33:48.480 --> 33:51.517
You know what it was like
for me in high school.

33:51.600 --> 33:55.229
All I wanted was
to be accepted.

33:56.960 --> 34:02.239
And they just tortured me.
I can't go back to
South Glen South.

34:02.560 --> 34:06.235
You're at South Glen South?
They have a killer
baseball team.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.518
Focus, please.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.591
OK, OK.

34:13.960 --> 34:17.429
You're an adult now, Josie.
You're successful.

34:17.520 --> 34:21.559
You graduated at
the top of your class.
You work for a newspaper.

34:21.639 --> 34:25.838
You wash your hair now.
You're not Josie Grossie
anymore.

34:25.920 --> 34:30.232
Don't you know how much
I just wanted to be you
in high school?

34:30.320 --> 34:34.916
Just for one day
to know what it was
like to be popular.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.389
It's not that hard, Josie.

34:37.480 --> 34:40.790
All you need is
the right person,

34:40.880 --> 34:43.110
one person to think
you're cool, and you're in.

34:43.199 --> 34:45.315
Everyone will be too
scared to question it.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.753
Is that true?

34:46.840 --> 34:50.196
Yeah,
it's a little-known fact.

34:50.679 --> 34:56.072
Don't you want to show 'em?
Gus, Billy Prince, yourself.

34:56.159 --> 35:00.199
Don't you want to show 'em
the cool kids don't
freak you out anymore?

35:00.280 --> 35:04.398
That you can go in there
and be friends with them
and get your story?

35:04.480 --> 35:06.710
Yes, desperately.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.553
Plus, if you quit now,
you're no better than me.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.789
Better than I.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.558
That's the spirit.

35:12.640 --> 35:15.791
So let's hear it.
"I'm not Josie Grossie
anymore."

35:15.880 --> 35:18.269
I'm not Josie Grossie
anymore.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.910
That's it. Now scream it.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.878
I'm not Josie Grossie
anymore!

35:29.880 --> 35:31.871
That's good.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.959
Josie the Pussycat.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.514
George?
what are you doing here?

35:48.720 --> 35:52.395
Ah. Get in the van.
Go, go.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.391
welcome to the love shack.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.273
All right.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.952
George, what's going on?

36:06.040 --> 36:08.031
A little surveillance.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.918
what are you doing?
Hidden camera.

36:13.000 --> 36:13.989
wings?

36:14.080 --> 36:15.399
Yeah.

36:15.480 --> 36:19.553
That's great, but I
really should talk to Gus
about this first.

36:19.640 --> 36:23.519
Geller, stop being
a pain in the ass.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.555
Gus?

36:24.640 --> 36:28.872
No, it's
the great and powerful Oz.
You're in way over your head.

36:28.960 --> 36:33.317
Here's how it's gonna work.
I review the tapes,
I find your story.

36:33.400 --> 36:37.951
All right.
Battery, transmitter.
Plug it in.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.354
Man.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.271
There we go.
Good luck to you.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.794
I don't believe
this. George?
Hm?

36:44.880 --> 36:47.792
How are you so cool?

36:47.880 --> 36:53.512
It's hard work.
Herbs, berries.
I'll be watching you.

36:56.920 --> 37:00.879
All right, let's get
this party started. Yeah.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.395
Come on, picture, come on.
There. Oh...

37:06.480 --> 37:09.836
There. Ooh,
they didn't look that good
when I went to high school.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.677
Kirsten, Kristin, Gibby!
what's up, girlfriends?

37:16.400 --> 37:17.958
Ooh.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.234
I'm OK.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.833
That's gonna leave a mark.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.117
"And so it is
Rosalind in disguise

37:24.200 --> 37:29.115
"who is best
able to see through
the disguises of others.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.431
"To say to Phoebe 'Mistress,
know thyself.'

37:32.560 --> 37:34.676
"To look at love
from every angle.

37:34.800 --> 37:39.590
"And to realize, finally,
that she is in
love with Orlando.

37:39.680 --> 37:44.515
"To free both hearts,
not in judgment
but in equality. "

37:44.600 --> 37:46.909
That's really well written.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.275
Showtime's over.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.238
Come on, move it.
Back to work.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.314
Gus, have you ever
been in love?

37:57.480 --> 37:58.879
Leave.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.279
Oh, give it up, Gus.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.193
Come on. I'm just
making conversation.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.031
Love...

38:08.360 --> 38:12.717
who knows what that is?
Deadlines, circulation...
That I understand.

38:15.640 --> 38:18.108
You know, you should go out
every now and then.

38:18.320 --> 38:22.518
If you put on
a couple of new ties,
girls would be all over you.

38:23.560 --> 38:26.791
Anita?
what?

38:26.880 --> 38:29.155
Leave me alone.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.800
I've got enough
work here to
last me all night.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.917
I don't have
anything to do tonight,

38:36.040 --> 38:39.715
so if you would
like some help,
I would love to help you.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.310
No Roger from Op-Ed?

38:46.400 --> 38:48.391
Nope.

38:59.960 --> 39:04.556
Excuse me, do you guys think
that we could work out
some kind of schedule,

39:04.640 --> 39:06.676
and I could work around it?

39:06.760 --> 39:09.593
Hey. where's your sweatshirt?

39:09.680 --> 39:12.194
Oh, I must have
forgotten it.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.510
I have an extra
in my locker.
I'll go get it.

39:14.600 --> 39:17.797
So, I'll see you tonight,
7.30, Na-Na's, right?

39:17.880 --> 39:19.996
OK, right, 7.30.
Yeah.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.275
I'm late for lab.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.839
Ozomatli? Oh, yes.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.878
This band is so good.
Have you heard
this band play?

39:26.960 --> 39:28.518
I'll get my mom's car
and I'll drive.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.670
This is gonna
be rufalicious!

39:30.760 --> 39:35.709
No, Jason,
it's not a stick of gum.
It's "rufus". "Rufus."

40:08.200 --> 40:09.519
You drinking tonight?

40:09.600 --> 40:10.874
Uh, no.

40:10.960 --> 40:15.272
I'm not 21. I'm 1 7, and I
still attend high school.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.999
Two of you?

40:39.880 --> 40:42.348
Josie! Josie.
Hi.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.193
Out on a school night?

40:45.280 --> 40:47.555
The bathroom was disgusting.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.596
I'd like you to meet Lara.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.432
His girlfriend.

40:51.520 --> 40:54.876
She's visiting from New York.
Josie's one of my students.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.632
How are you?
what?

40:56.720 --> 40:58.870
Hi, there!

40:58.960 --> 41:01.918
I'm sorry.
I can't even think in here.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.956
No offence.
I know you love this.

41:04.040 --> 41:08.272
I just hope you get it
all out of your system
before you move to New York.

41:08.400 --> 41:12.234
My firm has season tickets
to the Met.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.754
Oh, well, I love baseball!

41:18.840 --> 41:21.195
Nice to meet you.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.709
Nice to meet you, too.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.039
we are tomorrow.
Hello, I'm tomorrow.

41:39.120 --> 41:43.875
Cos when we get the money
and the power,
the women come to me.

41:43.960 --> 41:47.748
Do what I'm doin'. You know,
if you ain't movin',
no movement.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.193
write that down.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.917
welcome to my
little humble abode,
you know?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.878
Let me just
handle my business.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.554
wait a minute.
Got something funky.

42:14.120 --> 42:17.237
That was great, you guys.
That was great.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.072
Excuse me? Can I sit there?

42:29.160 --> 42:32.789
Yeah. we accept all people.
we are all about the love.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.393
Come on and have a seat.

42:34.480 --> 42:35.879
Thank you so much.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.875
How are you?
Very well. How are you?

42:39.960 --> 42:42.679
I'm feeling good.
I feel real good.

42:42.760 --> 42:46.116
we have a special cake
for you.

42:46.200 --> 42:48.395
Have some cake.

42:48.480 --> 42:53.713
It's a special cake,
a ganja cake.
It has vitamin A, vitamin B,

42:53.840 --> 42:56.912
vitamin T, H and C.
It's good for you.
Eat it up.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.956
what?

42:59.160 --> 43:03.392
Is that...? No, girl,
put it back. Just say no.

43:03.640 --> 43:04.789
Mm!

43:05.200 --> 43:06.428
Good, huh?

43:06.560 --> 43:09.154
That is delicious.
You know,
I love chocolate.

43:11.160 --> 43:13.116
She gonna get
tore off the floor!

43:17.040 --> 43:20.191
Firecracker.
He was a firecracker!

43:22.680 --> 43:24.318
Firecracker.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.031
Man, I don't love her.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.917
whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

44:04.240 --> 44:05.719
I know this woman.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.392
She's my superior.

44:18.320 --> 44:19.514
what is that?

44:21.440 --> 44:23.192
Let me hear you say "yeah"!

44:42.600 --> 44:45.239
I'm telling you,
Rob, I think
I really did it.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.273
I think I'm totally in!
I was so cool!

44:49.840 --> 44:52.070
You know what's
a weird word?
"Fork."

44:52.960 --> 44:55.076
Oh! Did I tell you about
the new friends I made?

44:55.160 --> 44:57.754
I made friends with
a whole table of Rastafari.

44:58.040 --> 45:00.110
Not just one.
A whole table!

45:02.080 --> 45:04.878
Oh, my God.
Someone ate my entire pie.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.871
I don't know
how that happened.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.109
Hi, Guy!

45:37.200 --> 45:38.918
Guys, Guy's guys!

45:39.000 --> 45:40.319
Hey, loser.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.351
Oh, my God.
Loser!

45:52.320 --> 45:54.515
what is going on up here?

45:56.000 --> 45:56.989
Everybody goin' nuts?

45:58.840 --> 45:59.989
Loser!

46:03.840 --> 46:04.989
Loser.

46:28.200 --> 46:30.111
All right,
all right,
look up, girl.

46:30.200 --> 46:31.519
Jo-Jo, look up.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.630
"Loser." See?
"Loser." Look!

46:35.120 --> 46:36.269
Hello?

46:37.240 --> 46:38.229
Yes!

46:43.560 --> 46:44.595
Oh, my God!

46:46.000 --> 46:49.037
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.874
whoa, calm down.
Just wash it off.
we're all cool.

46:55.360 --> 46:56.395
what are you doin'?

46:58.320 --> 47:00.390
I see you had
wheaties for breakfast.

47:03.360 --> 47:06.750
Bleuch. It's like
the All-Humiliation Network.

47:23.240 --> 47:27.518
when you call my name
It's like a little prayer

47:27.600 --> 47:31.832
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there

47:31.960 --> 47:33.791
In the midnight hour...

47:37.880 --> 47:39.199
Hello?

47:39.280 --> 47:40.395
Oh, hi, Billy.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.116
OK, I'll be out
in a jiffer.

47:45.600 --> 47:46.555
Have fun.

47:46.640 --> 47:48.119
OK, thanks.
Bye-bye!

47:56.800 --> 47:57.789
Hi, Billy!

48:05.640 --> 48:07.790
write a poem
about this, geek!

48:21.240 --> 48:23.515
Josie?
Is that you, honey?

48:47.080 --> 48:49.196
Josie, get up.

48:49.320 --> 48:51.311
Josie, are you OK?

48:52.520 --> 48:53.669
Josie.

48:54.680 --> 48:55.715
Are you crazy?

48:55.960 --> 48:57.029
what are you doing here?

48:57.400 --> 48:59.516
I just registered.
Check it out.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.670
Manufactured
at the Tiki Post.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.274
Can you do that?

49:04.360 --> 49:05.429
I just did.

49:07.840 --> 49:09.432
Jose, this is it.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.279
This is my ninth inning.

49:11.360 --> 49:14.352
The game isn't over.
I just thought it was.

49:14.440 --> 49:17.113
See, if I get
on the South Glen
baseball team,

49:17.200 --> 49:18.952
the right scout sees me,

49:19.040 --> 49:21.713
I'm in the minors.
It's game time!

49:21.800 --> 49:23.358
But you're 23 years old.

49:23.480 --> 49:26.153
Yeah, with the reading
comprehension
of a 1 5-year-old.

49:27.200 --> 49:28.633
Plus, I'm popular.

49:28.720 --> 49:30.472
You wanna be popular.

49:30.560 --> 49:32.437
I recognize a cry for
help when I see one.

49:32.760 --> 49:34.113
Hear one.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.514
whatever.

49:35.920 --> 49:37.592
That is so like you.

49:37.680 --> 49:40.274
You know,
you can't just
come in here

49:40.360 --> 49:42.555
and be popular
in just one day.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.713
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob!

50:08.080 --> 50:10.275
I'm the coleslaw
king of the world!

50:11.320 --> 50:13.117
Dude, you rock, man.

50:15.960 --> 50:17.439
He is so hot.

50:19.600 --> 50:20.999
Hi.
Hey.

50:21.120 --> 50:24.078
I'm Tracy. I'm 1 6.

50:24.160 --> 50:25.513
I'm a gymnast.

50:25.600 --> 50:27.272
I don't have a boyfriend.

50:27.400 --> 50:28.469
Cool.

50:30.200 --> 50:31.349
Josie?

50:31.880 --> 50:34.474
where were you last night?
I was really worried.

50:34.560 --> 50:35.629
what?

50:35.760 --> 50:37.876
You know,
last night at 7.30?

50:38.000 --> 50:41.436
Na-Na's? I kept calling you,
but I just got your machine.

50:41.520 --> 50:44.592
I don't even know
your parents' line.
I was really worried.

50:45.400 --> 50:47.630
I'm sorry.
I must have forgot.

50:48.960 --> 50:52.236
Maybe you should forget
about sitting with us, too.

50:56.880 --> 50:59.348
Let's make some
money for the prom!

51:00.560 --> 51:02.551
Mr. Coulson! Oh!

51:20.680 --> 51:22.272
watch your step.

51:23.320 --> 51:24.753
where's your partner?

51:24.840 --> 51:26.831
I don't have one.

51:26.920 --> 51:29.718
Lonely ride
in bucket five!

51:29.800 --> 51:30.915
Single!

51:31.000 --> 51:32.991
Do you have
to yell it like that?

51:33.080 --> 51:34.354
Sure, I do.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.031
Thank you.
watch your step.

51:37.840 --> 51:38.989
Is this seat taken?

51:41.360 --> 51:42.679
Thank you.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.318
Thank you.
You're welcome.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.035
whoa!

51:52.520 --> 51:53.714
whoa.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.279
Are you scared?

51:55.360 --> 51:57.510
Uh, well,
I'll tell you
something here.

51:58.440 --> 52:02.274
I hope this doesn't
undermine my position as
an authority figure, but...

52:03.280 --> 52:05.510
I'm a little
afraid of heights.

52:05.960 --> 52:08.349
You're afraid of
the Ferris wheel?

52:08.800 --> 52:11.792
Actually,
it's the plunging
headfirst

52:11.920 --> 52:14.115
into the crowd part
that kind of gets me.

52:14.200 --> 52:18.034
I bet if you had
your Gordie Howe helmet
on you'd feel better.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.313
Hey, you remember
that story?

52:20.400 --> 52:22.231
I remember
everything you say...

52:23.080 --> 52:24.991
in your classroom.

52:25.560 --> 52:29.109
If the bucket's a-rocking,
don't come a-kn-kn-knocking!

52:29.520 --> 52:31.875
Yeah! Yeah!

52:32.480 --> 52:34.152
Boys.
I know.

52:34.240 --> 52:36.595
Mr. Coulson
rocks my world!

52:38.720 --> 52:41.393
I'd like to tell you that
we all grow out of it.

52:41.480 --> 52:42.469
It's a lie.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.710
Some of us will
always be rattling cages.

52:45.320 --> 52:47.072
why do you do that?

52:48.320 --> 52:50.959
I don't know.

52:51.040 --> 52:54.589
what's scary is that
when you get older,
it gets more confusing.

52:54.920 --> 52:58.230
I mean, you know Lara,
my girlfriend you
met at the club?

52:58.880 --> 53:00.199
we've been going out
for five years,

53:00.320 --> 53:03.039
and now she wants me
to move to New York.

53:03.920 --> 53:06.275
And, you know,
I mean, I should do it.

53:06.480 --> 53:08.675
You know,
make the commitment
and grow up.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.271
I know we have
our differences.

53:13.760 --> 53:16.752
I shouldn't be talking about
this stuff with you.
I'm sorry.

53:18.120 --> 53:20.634
It's nice to have
someone to talk to.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.758
Yeah, same here.

53:28.640 --> 53:29.868
when you're my age,

53:29.960 --> 53:32.952
guys will be
lined up around
the block for you.

53:35.720 --> 53:38.393
You have to say that
cos you're my teacher.

53:40.800 --> 53:44.110
Actually, I shouldn't
say that because
I'm your teacher.

53:45.280 --> 53:46.315
Oh.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.077
Josie Geller? No way.

53:52.360 --> 53:53.429
Yeah.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.192
She dated
the drummer from
the Big Bad Voodoo Daddys?

53:55.680 --> 53:57.716
I've always wanted to
be a drummer. Always.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.874
And then she dumped him
for the drummer...

54:02.680 --> 54:04.477
All right, that's it.

54:05.400 --> 54:07.516
Just water
and Ex-Lax till prom.

54:08.640 --> 54:09.755
It's all about hydration.

54:10.200 --> 54:13.078
Did you guys
know that Josie's dad
invented Ex-Lax?

54:13.640 --> 54:15.995
She's, like, the heiress
to the Ex-Lax fortune.

54:16.080 --> 54:17.115
Shut up.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.039
No, it's true.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.389
She spends all of
her extra time
with her family

54:22.480 --> 54:24.675
on a yacht in
the South of France.

54:24.760 --> 54:25.829
wow.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.031
Quick hands,
quick hands.
Here we go.

54:38.120 --> 54:39.269
who's a winner?

54:39.360 --> 54:42.591
Focus. Good work, good work.
Easy, easy. Good work.

54:43.160 --> 54:45.037
Thanks for showing
me that new grip.

54:45.520 --> 54:46.999
It totally
changed my swing, man.

54:47.080 --> 54:48.229
No problem.

54:48.320 --> 54:49.514
Hey, what's goin' on?

54:49.640 --> 54:51.676
You guys know
Josie Geller?

54:51.760 --> 54:52.875
I know her.
You mean Loser?

54:53.640 --> 54:55.312
Nah, man,
she's cool.

54:55.400 --> 54:57.277
I used to go
out with her, man.

54:57.360 --> 54:58.429
what?

54:58.520 --> 55:00.112
She dumped me.
we're still good friends.

55:00.280 --> 55:01.395
Really?

55:01.480 --> 55:02.754
Hey, wait.
Like, how good?

55:03.320 --> 55:04.673
Good friends.
Good good?

55:04.760 --> 55:05.875
She is amazing.

55:11.240 --> 55:12.753
All right, guys.

55:13.160 --> 55:16.232
As you've probably noticed,
this certainly isn't English.

55:16.560 --> 55:20.155
Um...
we've combined a few classes
today here for the seminar.

55:20.440 --> 55:23.159
Hopefully,
the speaker will be
here any minute now.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.112
Hi.
Hey! Oh, hi.

55:28.640 --> 55:30.835
Uh...
You're here for
the sex talk?

55:30.920 --> 55:34.390
well... I like a man
who gets right to the point.

55:35.200 --> 55:36.235
Are you Pam?

55:36.600 --> 55:37.919
If you say so.

55:38.520 --> 55:39.555
OK.

55:40.680 --> 55:43.592
This is Pam Kitterman.
She's leading us in
our sex discussion.

55:43.680 --> 55:45.557
what? what?
Yes. Come on.

55:45.720 --> 55:47.153
No, I'm... what?

55:47.280 --> 55:49.475
I am not...
Oh, I am.

55:49.560 --> 55:50.913
Right, that's correct.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.510
Hi, I'm Pa...
I'm Pam. Hi.

55:54.320 --> 55:55.639
Um, sex...

55:57.200 --> 56:02.115
well, yes, sex...
Um, what do
you say, you know?

56:03.200 --> 56:05.839
Uh... you like a guy,
you do it with him.

56:05.920 --> 56:07.956
Sometimes he calls,
sometimes he doesn't.

56:08.520 --> 56:10.238
whoo!

56:13.440 --> 56:14.589
Oh.

56:14.680 --> 56:15.874
Hi.

56:15.960 --> 56:16.915
what are you doing here?

56:17.000 --> 56:18.797
I came by to say hello.

56:18.960 --> 56:21.349
Oh, my God,
your teacher is
such a fox!

56:21.480 --> 56:22.629
He's coming back.

56:22.960 --> 56:26.236
Um, why don't we
talk about that later?

56:26.440 --> 56:29.955
And I just wanna say
that the burning
sensation is totally normal.

56:30.640 --> 56:31.629
Ew!

56:32.440 --> 56:34.078
Sex is really fun.

56:35.560 --> 56:38.154
when you're old enough,

56:38.240 --> 56:40.117
which none of you are.

56:40.320 --> 56:41.799
I should know.

56:42.560 --> 56:45.916
Cos when you lose it to
some guy named Junior
with bad breath

56:46.000 --> 56:50.437
in the back of a van,
you're gonna wish
you'd listened to your mom

56:50.520 --> 56:52.875
when she said
"Nobody will buy
the ice-cream truck

56:52.960 --> 56:55.838
"when you're handin' out
the Popsicles for free."

56:59.320 --> 57:00.673
Any questions?

57:06.280 --> 57:11.070
Oh, I know it's hard.
I mean, difficult.
Difficult.

57:11.160 --> 57:14.038
But safe sex is
really important.

57:14.360 --> 57:17.352
OK, so just imagine

57:17.440 --> 57:20.432
that the bananas
are the real thing.

57:20.880 --> 57:24.509
In a land called
Every Man's Fantasy.

57:25.800 --> 57:27.392
God, I can't do this.

57:28.960 --> 57:32.873
Maybe because
we're not supposed to be
having sex with bananas.

57:34.520 --> 57:36.636
Do you really think she
hooked up with Rob?

57:36.720 --> 57:38.233
They're so different.

57:38.320 --> 57:40.197
Sometimes opposites attract.

57:40.560 --> 57:42.357
You know what, though?

57:42.640 --> 57:44.358
I feel like I'm
really ready to do it.

57:45.360 --> 57:48.591
You know, like,
have sex for the first time.

57:51.720 --> 57:52.869
It's a big deal.

57:53.080 --> 57:54.069
I know.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.718
Just make sure
you've found
the right person.

57:55.800 --> 57:57.518
You know,
Adelie penguins,

57:58.240 --> 58:01.869
they spend their whole lives
looking for that
one other penguin.

58:02.240 --> 58:04.390
And when they
meet them, they know.

58:05.040 --> 58:08.112
And they spend the rest
of their lives together.

58:08.280 --> 58:09.395
But I'm not a penguin.

58:09.680 --> 58:10.874
It's an analogy.

58:14.720 --> 58:16.039
Excuse me.

58:16.480 --> 58:17.799
I have to go die now.

58:21.160 --> 58:23.993
Hey, kids,
Sydney here.
Bad news about the prom.

58:25.200 --> 58:27.270
East Glen East is gonna
do "Millennium", too.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.718
what? Oh, my God.

58:35.440 --> 58:37.476
Calm down.
Calm down!

58:37.560 --> 58:39.232
Calm down! Sit!

58:42.120 --> 58:43.678
Let's focus, all right?

58:43.760 --> 58:46.593
It's prom theme.
All we need is a new idea.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.475
Ooh! How about
"Under the Sea"?

58:50.560 --> 58:51.879
Yeah, right.

58:51.960 --> 58:52.995
It's been done.

58:53.080 --> 58:54.115
How about "the '80s"?

58:56.720 --> 58:58.517
what do you think we are?
Amateurs?

59:02.160 --> 59:03.957
All right.
All right.

59:04.560 --> 59:05.549
Josie.

59:07.640 --> 59:09.312
That's not a theme.

59:09.920 --> 59:11.876
Thank you. No.

59:13.560 --> 59:15.630
OK,
Josie will have the answer.

59:26.840 --> 59:29.832
How about
"Meant for Each Other"?

59:30.280 --> 59:32.475
Famous couples
throughout history.

59:37.600 --> 59:38.999
Absolutely.

59:39.080 --> 59:40.433
Absolutely!

59:41.200 --> 59:42.553
Oh, we love it.

59:42.680 --> 59:43.795
That is so brilliant.

59:56.320 --> 59:59.392
Here comes a sign
in the form of a girl

59:59.480 --> 01:00:04.156
She's the finest,
sweetest thing in the world

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:07.915
Oh, take you
to Heaven tonight

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.557
I feel the horses
coming galloping

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.232
In the summer ends

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.959
Take you to Heaven tonight

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.555
Oh, 'cause I love you

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.870
For what you are

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.552
Tonight, tonight we'll ride

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.518
I'll give it to you

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.434
we'll go to Heaven tonight

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.037
Tonight

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.798
Here, try these.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.553
No, Gus, listen.
It is a great story.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.836
They keep the tags on,

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.593
and then they
return the clothes
after they've worn them.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.829
Gus?

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.717
Hi.
what's up?

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.388
I was just looking
at this cardigan.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.079
Isn't it cool?
Oh, yes.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.354
Oh, my God.
Like, there goes
another lemming.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.516
I can't believe
that I could be happy

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.229
Summer will come again
I could be happy

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.869
Oh, stop your crying
You could be happy

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.589
Go to Heaven
when you make me happy

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.880
Good play!
Good play!

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.239
Go, sexy boy!

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.038
You guys,
victory dance.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.269
Oh, yeah.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.999
Rager party, tonight
at my house, baby. Yeah!

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.559
Yeah! whoo!

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.198
Great play, Rob.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.317
You might be just
what South Glen needs
to win State this year.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.431
will I play in
the championship game?

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.112
You'll start at shortstop.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.077
I don't wanna put
extra pressure on you,

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.276
but some pro
scouts will be there.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.271
Thanks, Coach Romano.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.549
You're welcome.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.710
Just glad to be
part of a team again.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.794
Josie, you have
totally transitioned.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.199
Transitioned?

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.833
Yeah, you crossed over.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.194
Into our group.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.349
It's hard.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.512
People go through high school
trying to transition
and never make it.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.874
wannabes.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.835
Guy is totally
crunching on you.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.157
Do I wanna be crunched?

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.674
By Guy?

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.748
Oh, yeah.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.549
Josie!

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.155
Hi.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.232
"Splendiferous"?

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.588
Totally!

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.199
I'm not going to her again.
She calls that a pedicure?

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.669
She wants me.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.709
Bye. Out.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.156
Night. Bye. Miss Haskell
is gone and forgotten.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:26.553
Sack races
at the company picnic,
yes or no?

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.473
Sorry I'm late.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.152
I love that top.
Thank you.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.229
So cute.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.389
It's all about horseshoes.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.835
Excuse me,
I'm trying to get
to a tennis game.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.957
what is the status
of your story?

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.959
Oh, great.
Totally rufus.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.312
Is there
something I could see?

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.913
Rufus?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.319
I have some notes.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.877
I don't need your notes.
I need your story.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.631
Though I must speak
for all of us here.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.757
I have seen your tapes.
Compelling stuff.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.512
But I want
the story in two weeks.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.238
Two weeks,
Miss Geller.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.954
Or I'll rufus you
right outta here.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.190
I think you're gonna
be a great reporter.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.273
But if you aren't,
you and Gus are fired.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.709
Next order of business:

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.791
marketing department,
yes or no?

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.919
Party's at Rob's!

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.949
Josie.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.954
Hello, you guys.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.549
Hi.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.756
I'm Rob's prom date.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.273
Really?
Yeah.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.157
Oh, my God. wow!

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.470
Yeah. Yeah,
she's 1 6 years old, Rob.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.477
I know, and a gymnast.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.551
It's totally illegal,
and I'll tell you why.
The following reasons are...

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.755
Hi.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.229
Hi.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.673
Hey, dude.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.795
I gotta talk to you.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.915
Please come here.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.037
I'll see you
around the cellblock,
Mrs. Robinson.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.157
Hey, Rob.
what do you wanna be
when you grow up?

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.309
Ball player.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.790
No, I know,
but, I mean,
what if you don't make it?

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.834
I mean,
you don't wanna be
working at the mail place

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.951
for the rest
of your life.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.190
It's OK for an after-school
job and all,

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:52.829
but "Hi, I'm Rob,
and I run the Tiki Post"?

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.679
Totally lame!

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:05.796
what is this?
Like a lemon-meringue pie
color or something?

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.677
It's... Ugh.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.039
You know what?

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.676
Maybe we should go
into another room.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.955
I've checked every
one of these rooms.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.635
There's, I mean,
serious couples in there.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.438
This is fine.
This is fine.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.950
Someone's gettin'
hooked up!

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.399
Yeah, baby!

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.955
wow.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.075
Rob's sister is a loser.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.875
Yeah.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.911
Um...
Please come here.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.439
I need to talk to you
about something.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.438
It's a comfy bed.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.549
OK.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.756
Feel it.
It's nice.
It's nice.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.269
Uh...

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.591
I know that you've
probably already heard

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.114
that I want to
ask you out to prom.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.314
But there's
something different
about asking in person.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.717
I know that we
didn't hit it off
in the beginning.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.556
And I really...

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.709
Yes.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.435
Yes.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.519
That's rufus.

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.558
Uh... where do I
pick you up?

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.471
How do we arrange this?
what do I do?

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.557
we can meet
here at Rob's,

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.632
and we can all share
a limousine together.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.639
Thank you.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.437
Have a good evening.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.479
And thank you.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:16.390
Hey, Jose.
Hey, Rob.

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:18.152
Lookin' good, guys.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.075
Josie, Robster,
rufus kegger.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.952
Man, you were wasted.

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.435
This is so unbelievable.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.633
I've waited my
whole life to fit in,
and I finally feel like I do.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.955
You do.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.189
Hey, Rob.

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:35.477
Hey, Josie,
who did Archie date?
Betty or Veronica?

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.193
Both.
See?

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.875
I always liked Betty better.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.434
Really?

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.397
Yeah,
Betty was so
fun and spunky.

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:45.710
I mean,
Veronica had
the great legs.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.553
She was too moody.
Very high-maintenance.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.832
You can't refuse to
sell me a ticket to prom.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.988
Listen, Alpo.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.036
we can do
whatever we want to.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.675
Like, I get it.
You guys don't know
how to count change.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:08:59.879
Oh, my God.
I'll make it easy.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.313
Here's the money.
I'm taking the ticket.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.513
Oh, my God.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.912
She was mocking us.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:09.950
Did you see that?

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.593
we gotta
make her dog food.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.669
She is going down.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.709
There.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.072
Oh. I got you a meeting
with the admissions guy
from Dartmouth.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.158
Dartmouth?

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:29.438
But I wasn't
gonna go to college.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.595
No, I pulled some strings,

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.673
and I got him to
look at your writing,

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.193
and he agreed
to meet with you.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.792
You believe in me
that much?

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.198
Of course I do, Josie.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:44.437
You owe it to yourself,
to your writing,
to go to college.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:47.277
You are a great writer.

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:50.589
You just have to
find your story.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.519
He is your story.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.591
You're crazy. No!

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.275
No. No.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.278
what do you mean, no?
It's got it all.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.876
Sex, intrigue, immorality
in the education system.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.229
He's my teacher.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.038
Yeah, that's the best part.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.793
"Student-teacher relations:
how close is too close?"

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.075
we're gonna blow
the lid off it!

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.718
There's no lid.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.714
There's nothing
going on between Sa...

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.358
Mr. Coulson and me.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.554
Everyone is
in here every day,
watching you two.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.471
It's like
The Young and the Restless.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.676
Rigfort is
salivating over it.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.751
You pitched this
to Rigfort?

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.716
Josie, this isn't a joke.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.075
You heard Rigfort.
Both our asses
are on the line.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.071
Now, this is the story.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.910
Call me when
you've got it.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.513
Josie, you look so...

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.069
Rufus?

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.320
Yes, exactly.
Major rufus.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.788
what are you
supposed to be?

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.395
Duh!

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.796
Tom Cruise,
Risky Business.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.713
That's nice.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.275
Thank you for
everything, Rob.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.876
It's all really happening,

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.510
and I know it's
because of you.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.597
My wallet. Shit.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.799
where are you
gonna put it?

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.916
Come on, beautiful.
Let's go.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.519
Hey, how you doin'?

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.749
Hello?

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.352
If you don't hurry,
we'll miss the whole thing.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.359
we'll talk.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.590
Oh, my God.
You totally ripped off
my Malibu Barbie idea!

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.031
Uh-uh.
I'm Disco Barbie.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.593
And I'm Evening Gown Barbie.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.992
Josie, darling,
you look rufus.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.877
who are you guys?

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.633
Don't tell me.
You're Medieval Barbie?

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.869
Get over it.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.916
we're Rosalind and Orlando.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.669
Shakespeare?

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.317
Look, I get to
have a sword.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.316
Oh, my God,
that is so awesome.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.559
Rad! That is so rad.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.959
I want a sword.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.634
All right,
look at this place!

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.392
Beautiful.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.994
Come on,
let's dance.
I'm Tom Cruise.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.310
This is the most
beautiful prom
I've ever been to.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.075
work, Merk,
work, Merk, work it.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.029
Great.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.709
what are you doing?

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.872
Practicing my
surprised face for when
they name prom court.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:59.673
Oh, sorry, there's
no room at this table.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.712
It's just
too bad for them.

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.633
wait, I forgot.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.359
A little surprise for you.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:10.959
Did I miss the crowning?

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.598
No, but I'm
closing the pool.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.716
Josie's odds are 3-1,

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.031
and even money that
that kid pokes
himself with the sword.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.269
whoa!

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.152
OK, maybe we
should sit down.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.468
OK.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.834
OK. whoa.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.877
Are you having fun yet?

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.791
Uh, yeah.
Good.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.949
Definitely.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.553
Guess what.
what?

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.676
Gibby gave me champagne!

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.988
That's nice.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.195
Yeah.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.595
Rob? I've been thinking.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.153
And I think...

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.073
I mean, I know

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.553
you're the one.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.795
Oh.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.113
My penguin.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.631
I want you to
be my first.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.076
Once the floor
stops spinning,
let's have sex.

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.556
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Put that down.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.473
All right.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.668
Tell you what, Tracy.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.875
what?

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.679
I'm flattered,

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.912
but I say

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.915
I'm gonna go
get some more punch,

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.594
then we'll go on
the dance floor
and boogie.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.755
That's good.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.438
No! Uh-oh!

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.639
Help! I'm stuck.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.795
Brett!

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.950
The Denominators
are here!

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.789
whoo!

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.479
Make way
for the Denominators!

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.234
You guys,
what is the one thing

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.590
that could ruin
my senior prom?

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.952
That you would trip
on your Barbie heels
and I'd be named prom queen.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.868
Did I just
say that out loud?

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.075
whoo!

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.198
So, who are you
supposed to be?

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.918
Other than freaks?
Yeah.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.311
we're DNA.
Double helix?

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.428
But I guess you'd
actually know that
if you passed bio.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.434
No, no,
don't touch the hydrogen.
It's rented.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.233
Yo, yo,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.676
give it up for Mr. Coulson
and Miss Knox!

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.876
OK, OK, enough.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.751
Our 1999 prom court.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.351
And the princesses are,

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.954
Miss Kristin Davis...

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.952
Miss Kirsten Leosis
and Miss Gibby Zarefsky.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.872
And the princes are:

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.232
Mr. Thomas Salamey...

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.352
Mr. Jason way...

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.031
and Mr. Rob...

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.034
Mr. Rob.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.108
Mr. Rob!

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.952
Mr. Rob.

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.759
That's me!

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.908
Yeah!

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.868
whoo!

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:28.109
Next up,
South Glen 's prom king,

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.559
Guy Perkins.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.596
And this year's prom queen.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.273
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.399
Josie Geller!

01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.949
Yeah!

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.792
I knew you could
do it, girl.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.235
And as is custom,
the king and the queen

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.515
will now have
their first dance.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.116
I never made it
to my prom.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.394
Really?

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.669
I only made it to
the parking lot.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.956
Tell me what
you're thinking.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.309
I was thinking
about Shakespeare,

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.508
how he described
a night like this.

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:28.636
"Look how the floor of heaven
is thick inlaid with
patines of bright gold."

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.316
what are you
thinking about?

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.548
My sword.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.755
Oh.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.236
Josie,
you rock my world.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.829
You're, like,
the most amazing girl
that I've ever dated.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.839
You're so fun to be with.
You're smart,

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:56.799
you're crazy.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.199
You are...

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.832
You rock my world.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:04.757
You said that already.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.789
Yeah.

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.638
Erase and rewind

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:16.635
'Cause I've been
changing my mind

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:21.077
I've changed my mind

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.277
Is this chocolate? OK.

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:39.995
Hey.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.115
Hi.

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.512
wow, you make a really
beautiful prom queen.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.954
Really?

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.272
Thanks. So do you.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.869
I always feel like
kind of a goofball
in these penguin suits,

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.996
Iike I'm at
my own wedding.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.071
Do you...
Do you wanna...

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.035
OK.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.629
Hello.

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.272
Aldys, I figured
that since it's prom,

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.030
Iet's put all
the shit behind us.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.793
I would love nothing more
than to dance with you.

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.799
All right.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:28.150
That's, of course,
if it's OK with the rest
of the double helix.

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.068
Yes? OK.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.950
You know, it's funny.
Proms always make
me a little sad.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.234
They're so final,
you know?

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.118
Graduation,
everyone scattering,
moving on.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.276
Is your girlfriend here?

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.397
No. No, I'm alone.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.676
In fact,
we broke up last week.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.989
Really?

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.675
That's funny
because, actually,

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.955
"prom" comes from
"promenade",

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.877
and you can't
promenade alone, can you?

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.035
You're amazing,
Josie Geller.

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.993
Have you thought about
Dartmouth any more?

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.875
Yes.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.712
And there's something
that I wanna tell you.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.030
No, no, no.
Not now, not now!

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.155
There's something
I wanna tell you, too.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.352
No! No!

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:19.108
I knew it!
You are a loser!

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.311
You ruined everything!

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.034
You so do not
deserve to be prom queen!

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.556
Let me tell you something.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.190
I don't care about being
your stupid prom queen.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.917
I'm 25 years old!

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.517
I'm an undercover reporter
for the Chicago Sun-Times.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.279
And I have been
beating my brains out,

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.035
trying to impress you people!

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.469
Let me tell you something,
Gibby, Kirsten, Kristin.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.715
You will spend your lives
trying to keep others down

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.519
because it makes you
feel more important!

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.948
why her?

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.273
Let me tell you
something about this girl.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.112
She is unbelievable.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.469
I was new here,
and she befriended me,
no questions asked.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:12.150
But you,
you were only my friend
after my brother Rob

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:16.192
posed as a student
and told you to like me.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.359
Robby Rob?
Ew.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.431
All of you people,
there is a big
world out there.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.158
Bigger than prom,

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:26.833
bigger than high school,

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.868
and it won't matter
if you were the prom queen

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.517
or the quarterback
of the football team

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.313
or the biggest nerd
in school.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.397
Find out who you are

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.435
and try not to
be afraid of it.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.193
Excuse me.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.030
whoo! whoo! Yeah!

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.038
wow, that was
just like Carrie.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.634
I thought she was
gonna kill us all.

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.635
All right, you guys.
Go, Rams!

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:13.828
All right.

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:17.515
Can somebody take
the Alpo girls outside
and hose 'em off?

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.670
South Glen,
class of 1999,

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.031
are you ready to party?

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.670
we lost the feed.
Gus is goin' nuts.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.113
He's calling
every five minutes.

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.077
Did you get the story?

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.388
No.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.596
Tell me you got
something on Coulson.

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:42.715
No!

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.632
I'm just gonna go.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.474
So... Surprise.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.916
"Surprise",
you were doing
a story on me?

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.871
No, I couldn't.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.436
I mean, "surprise",
I was hoping...

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.635
what?

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:22.395
what?
You were hoping what?
That I'd be happy?

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:25.313
Because suddenly
I was allowed to be
attracted to you?

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.352
You were attracted to me?

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.509
Goddamn it.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.238
You set me up
for a story.

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.673
No, I... I...

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:33.872
Just drop the act.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.515
OK?

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.717
I mean, every word
out of your mouth
has been a complete lie.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.998
I don't know you at all.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.753
Look, if we
could just spend
some time together,

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.070
you could
get to know me again.

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.396
wait, please
don't walk away.

01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:01.674
I just can't look
at you the same way.

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.549
Rob.

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.352
Hey, Josie.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.874
I came by to check on you.
I was worried about you.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.799
Really?

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.075
No, not really.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.233
Not really, Josie.

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.630
How could you
do this to me?

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:39.790
I helped you.
I got you everything
you wanted.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.917
And you repay me by
blowing everything

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.150
two days before
the championship!

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.719
I wasn't even thinking.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.398
No, you weren't.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.949
Did it occur to you
that the only time

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.473
I've been happy in
the past five years

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:57.758
is when I'm playing ball,
when I'm part of a team?

01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.195
Josie, it's not even
about playing.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:01.793
I taught those guys things.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:04.235
I helped 'em.
My life had meaning.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:05.829
I...

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.273
Just forget about it.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.352
It's over.
Back to the Tiki Post.
Totally lame.

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.550
"Josie Geller
Blows Her Cover."

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.192
And we were scooped.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:21.030
we've got nothing. Zippo.

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.309
Josie,
you totally and completely
screwed both of us.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:31.638
Maybe I could
talk to Rigfort.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.352
Tell him the whole story.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.715
You know,
I'll tell you a story, OK?

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.438
It's about this
shy copy editor

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:43.030
who makes a total mockery
of herself and her boss

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:47.033
when she completely
botches her first
assignment as a reporter.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.390
we are not screwed.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.311
Yes, I made a mistake.

01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.876
But we will
have a story, OK?

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:02.789
You will have
an amazing story.

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.074
Please.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.877
Oh, please.
Oh, please.

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.396
Excuse me, gentlemen,

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:34.268
I suggest you cover up
what you don't want seen.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:35.679
Thank you.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.072
Coach Romano?
Yeah?

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.470
I'm Josie Geller
from the Chicago Sun-Times.

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:47.596
I have a favor
to ask you.

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:50.240
Do you know
the sports guy,
Jim Lakin?

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.352
Sure, everybody
tries to get Big Jim

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.670
to come watch
their games. why?

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:58.436
what if I told you
that I can guarantee you
that Big Jim

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:02.149
and every other
reporter in the area
would cover your game?

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.556
I'd say you
could have whatever
you wanted, young lady.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:11.359
Someone once told me
that to write well,

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.715
you have to
write what you know.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.472
This is what I know.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.630
I am 25 years old,

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:20.280
and I have never really
kissed a guy.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:24.232
A geek to the core,
most of my childhood
was spent

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.232
doing extra homework
I requested from the teacher.

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.157
High school was
more of the same.

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:34.631
Then, at 1 7,
it seemed as if my luck
was about to change.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.553
The cutest guy asked me
to the senior prom.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.391
But it turned out
he invited me
as a cruel joke,

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.391
and I have
never fully recovered.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.390
Yes, it is embarrassing
to share this with the world.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.158
But it would be
hard to explain

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.629
what I learned
and how I learned it

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.029
without sharing this
humiliating history.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:59.071
I received an assignment,
my first as a reporter,

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:03.394
to go back
to high school and find out
about kids today.

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.154
what I ended up finding
was myself,

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:10.394
and that high school
hasn 't changed.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.829
There's still that
one teacher who marches
to her own drummer.

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.036
Those girls are still there,

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.111
the ones that,
even as you grow up,

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:24.159
will remain
the most beautiful girls
you have ever seen close up.

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:29.714
The smart kids,
who everyone else
knew as the brains,

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:32.957
but I just knew them
as my soul mates,

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.032
my teachers, my friends.

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.080
And there's still
that one guy,

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.191
with his
mysterious confidence,

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:46.397
who seems so perfect
in every way.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.950
The guy you get up
and go to school for
in the morning.

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:53.313
South Glen
would not have been
the same without him.

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:56.676
High school
would not have been
the same without him.

01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:00.473
I would not have
been the same
without him.

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:08.272
I lived a lifetime of regret
after my first
high-school experience.

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:12.553
And now, after my second,
my regrets are down to one.

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:17.669
A certain teacher
was hurt on my path
to self-discovery,

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:21.277
and, although this article
may serve as a step,

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:24.398
it in no way makes up
for what I did to him.

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.437
To this man,
you know who you are,

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.639
I am so sorry.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.196
And I would like to
add one more thing...

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:37.753
Movers.

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.438
Hang on a second.

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.750
I think I am
in love with you.

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.391
And so I propose this,

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.072
as an ending
to this article,

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.311
and perhaps a beginning to
the next chapter of my life,

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.231
I, Josie Geller,

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.039
will be at the state
championship baseball game,

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:57.874
where my friends,
the South Glen Rams,
are playing for the title.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.837
I will stand on
the pitcher's mound

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.753
for five minutes,
prior to the first pitch.

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.994
If this man
accepts my apology,

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.551
I ask him to come kiss me

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:11.071
for my first real kiss.

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:13.631
Look over here!

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.233
Josie! Josie!

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:19.392
Thank you all for coming.

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:20.993
Josie!

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:24.550
Oh, my God. There's so
many people here.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:28.110
They're behind you.
They feel like
they know you.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:31.393
It's romantic,
and they wanna be
a part of it.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.756
I'm glad that
you guys are.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.433
Oh, Anita!

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:44.717
Sweet Jesus,
I had no idea there'd be
this many TV crews here.

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.632
You held up your
end of this bargain.

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.472
Now get out there
and get him!

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:53.916
Josie!
Josie! Josie!

01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:58.076
Josie! Josie!
Josie! Josie!

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.115
Josie! we love you!

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.759
Thank you.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:24.638
May I have
five minutes on
the clock, please?

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.075
Hi!

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.430
wieners!
I got hot wieners.

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.078
Hi, Mr. Rigfort.

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.755
Get in your own row!

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:46.909
I got wieners here.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.194
Give 'em to me.

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:49.838
Thank you, Gus.

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.833
Have a wiener.

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:55.998
I love this.

01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:00.438
Sun-Times readers
out here en masse,

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:03.830
relating personally to
one of our reporters.

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.157
It's amazing,
isn't it?

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.198
Eight, seven...

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.038
That is so wrong.

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.069
wait.

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:16.795
Mr. Coulson!

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.912
well, it's been
building up inside of me

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.798
For, oh, I don't
know how long

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.518
Yeah, Mr. Coulson!

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.749
Yeah!

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.910
I don't know why
But I keep thinking

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.312
Something's bound to go wrong

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:10.078
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:15.280
And she says
Don't worry, Baby

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.628
Everything will
turn out all right

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.749
Don 't worry, Baby

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:30.678
Sorry I'm late.

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.430
It took me forever
to get here.

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:40.637
I know what you mean.

01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:51.472
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:57.078
when she says
Don't worry, Baby

01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:02.229
Everything will
turn out all right

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.150
Don 't worry, Baby

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.273
All right.

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.948
Attagirl.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:24.229
All right,
let's play ball, kids!
Come on!

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.831
She told me
Baby, when you race today

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:34.476
Just take along
my love with you

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.438
And if you knew
how much I loved you

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.433
Baby, nothing
could go wrong with you

01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:46.114
Oh, what she does to me

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.510
when she makes love to me

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.669
Love is an innocent,
innocent journey

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:06.469
Love is the cancer,
love ain't benign

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:09.870
Love is what keeps you
going all the time now

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.356
Love it, don't leave it,
don't leave it behind

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.476
Love is for free

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.315
when people like me

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:25.391
Crossing the seas,
to look for that someone

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.155
Love is for free

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.788
when people like me

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.918
Set their sights on you

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.638
I'll know what to do

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.429
Love is what I came for
Love is what's in store for

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:45.956
Love is an innocent,
innocent journey

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:49.476
Love is a cancer,
love ain 't benign

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.269
Love is what keeps you
going all the time now

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.750
Love it, don 't leave it,
don 't leave it behind

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.874
Love is for free

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.196
when people like me

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:30.276
Crossing the seas,
looking for that
special someone

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.075
Love is for free

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.351
I've got eyes to see

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.678
Looking for someone

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.552
Love could come along

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:45.312
Love is what
you're waiting for

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.436
Love is what you came for

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.830
Love is an innocent,
innocent journey

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:54.310
Love is the cancer,
love ain 't benign

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.029
Love is what keeps you
going all the time now

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:03.148
Love it, don 't leave it,
don 't leave it

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.909
Love it, don 't leave it,
don 't leave it behind

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.953
Monday morning
came too soon

01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.395
I think about you now
Layin ' in my room

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:44.711
Hearing everything you said

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:48.509
I play it back
A hundred times in my head

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:53.319
Then I slip into a dream

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:57.234
The feelin ' inside
Is ten stories high

01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:01.472
Never knew what love was
Until you loved me

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:06.475
Never knew what love was
Oh, yeah

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:10.155
'Cause it feels
so good sometimes

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:15.109
Don 't you know
it feels so bad sometimes,

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.317
The way you loved me,
loved me

01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:22.797
The way you loved me,
loved me

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:48.476
You know that I want you

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:51.757
You know that I need you

01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:56.118
Never knew what love was
Until you loved me

01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:00.671
Never knew what love was
Oh, yeah

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:04.673
'Cause it feels
so good sometimes

01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:09.470
Don't you know
it feels so bad sometimes

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.597
The way you loved me,
loved me

01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:17.198
The way you loved me,
loved me

01:45:18.305 --> 01:45:24.704
