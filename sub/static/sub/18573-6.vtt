00:42.584 --> 00:47.673
Narcissus! Narcissus!
Narcissus! Narcissus!

00:47.756 --> 00:50.342
Narcissus! Narcissus! Narcissus!

01:04.690 --> 01:05.899
People of Rome!

01:10.237 --> 01:14.158
For any gladiator
who steps onto the battleground,

01:15.742 --> 01:19.538
there is no greater achievement
 than the Rodarus.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.250
This wooden sword...

01:24.334 --> 01:28.797
is given only to gladiators whose
abilities transcend the battleground.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.968
Whose victories defy description.

01:34.887 --> 01:38.182
Those who have proven themselves
 superior to all others...

01:40.142 --> 01:45.397
in the eyes of the people,
their Emperor, and the Gods.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.237
Narcissus is such a gladiator.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.991
Undefeated on the battleground.

01:57.826 --> 02:02.331
Both feared and revered
by his opponents.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.795
He has more than earned this sword.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.138
And with it,

02:19.640 --> 02:20.641
his freedom.

02:54.758 --> 02:57.761
Commodus has honored
the man who trained him in the arena,

02:59.346 --> 03:02.975
marking the opening
of the greatest celebration of games

03:03.058 --> 03:06.145
since the dedication
of the Coliseum.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.646
Commodus! Commodus!

04:47.454 --> 04:49.873
12 years after claiming the throne,

04:54.336 --> 04:58.132
Commodus is prepared
to put his life on the line,

04:58.215 --> 05:00.008
to restore glory to his city,

05:01.009 --> 05:03.262
and win the respect of his people.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.311
I think if we'd attended the games,

05:11.395 --> 05:14.815
we would be amazed
at the glamour of the event.

05:15.607 --> 05:19.862
We would be overwhelmed
 by the noise of the crowd.

05:21.905 --> 05:27.369
We'd have been stunned
by the gladiators and their shiny armor.

05:27.911 --> 05:33.375
And we'd have been horrorstruck
at the ferocity of the fighting itself

05:33.459 --> 05:35.461
that goes on in the arena.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.466
Spanning 14 days,

05:41.425 --> 05:45.763
the Emperor's games feature hundreds
of exotic animals for live hunting,

05:47.639 --> 05:50.058
prisoners and slaves for executions,

05:51.435 --> 05:54.646
with lavish gifts and prizes
for those in attendance.

05:59.526 --> 06:04.573
With a full coliseum,
the games will be unlike any celebration

06:04.656 --> 06:06.366
in the history of Rome.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.916
Emperor Commodus!

06:30.682 --> 06:31.892
Senators...

06:32.559 --> 06:34.103
welcome to the games.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.195
Please, honor your host.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.746
For a crowd of
more than 50,000 people...

06:52.830 --> 06:54.498
May the Gods be with you.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.794
...Commodus has announced
that for the first time...

06:59.461 --> 07:00.921
May the Gods be with you.

07:01.713 --> 07:05.300
...the Emperor will fight as a gladiator.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.263
May the Gods be with you.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.099
Senator.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.939
May the Gods be with you.

07:20.149 --> 07:23.360
Precious jewels and fine robes
won't save him now.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.031
May the Gods be with you.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.498
May the Gods be with you.

07:41.545 --> 07:42.671
Senator Dio.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.758
May the Gods protect you, Commodus.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.779
People of Rome!

08:09.490 --> 08:12.451
Let the games begin!

08:22.086 --> 08:24.922
But while the Roman people
hail their ruler,

08:25.923 --> 08:29.760
members of the Senate
fear the Emperor's bold move

08:29.843 --> 08:31.512
would be his last.

08:46.527 --> 08:52.574
For Commodus, fighting as a gladiator
will solidify his popularity

08:53.325 --> 08:55.786
and secure his legacy as Emperor.

09:00.833 --> 09:06.505
But becoming a gladiator is just
the first step in a much bigger plan,

09:06.588 --> 09:10.008
one that will make him a legend.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.805
In Roman society,

09:14.888 --> 09:18.976
Hercules is celebrated
for slaying a mythical lion

09:19.059 --> 09:21.937
and wearing the animal's hide
for protection.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.191
For his games,

09:26.275 --> 09:30.279
Commodus is certain if he can
embody the Roman god,

09:30.362 --> 09:32.489
he too will be invincible...

09:32.573 --> 09:35.909
and be forever honored
by the Roman people.

09:39.163 --> 09:43.125
The Emperor Commodus
portrays himself as the god Hercules,

09:43.208 --> 09:45.669
a great fighter and a great hunter.

09:45.753 --> 09:46.879
What he's trying to do

09:46.962 --> 09:50.340
when he appears in the games
 dressed as Hercules,

09:50.424 --> 09:54.762
is underline to people
that when he fights as a gladiator,

09:54.845 --> 09:59.016
he is as skilled a fighter
 as the god Hercules was.

10:36.720 --> 10:42.893
All hail Commodus,
Emperor of Rome!

13:02.908 --> 13:04.868
For the first time,

13:04.952 --> 13:10.749
an emperor has claimed victory
as a gladiator in the Roman Coliseum.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.388
And in front of thousands,

13:25.889 --> 13:28.308
Commodus wins the recognition

13:28.392 --> 13:31.603
and validation he's always wanted.

13:39.570 --> 13:43.198
Commodus! Commodus!
Commodus! Commodus!

13:43.282 --> 13:45.784
After his triumph in the arena,

13:46.368 --> 13:52.541
Commodus believes he's proven himself
the supreme ruler of the Roman people.

13:52.624 --> 13:57.796
And with a new vision for the Empire,
he orders a meeting of the Senate.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.465
Senators...

14:04.845 --> 14:08.432
I called you here tonight
to share some important news with you.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.770
That I am...

14:13.604 --> 14:14.855
in fact...

14:15.647 --> 14:16.690
alive.

14:18.108 --> 14:21.904
When I first declared my intention
 to step on to the battleground

14:21.987 --> 14:23.864
and prove my worth
as a gladiator,

14:25.491 --> 14:27.117
many of you thought,
"He must be mad."

14:28.327 --> 14:29.953
While most of you assumed...

14:31.246 --> 14:32.664
"He'll surely be killed."

14:34.833 --> 14:36.710
But as all of you witnessed today,

14:39.379 --> 14:41.840
and the blood
on my sword confirms,

14:43.801 --> 14:48.347
it is my opponent
who no longer walks among us.

14:49.348 --> 14:50.432
And now,

14:52.392 --> 14:53.852
I stand here before you,

14:55.395 --> 14:56.897
not only victor in the Coliseum,

14:56.980 --> 15:00.859
but right here in this building.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.073
Because when 50,000 voices unite as one,

15:07.699 --> 15:09.493
everyone can hear it.

15:11.036 --> 15:15.457
Even a body as old,
and outdated, as the Senate.

15:18.544 --> 15:21.922
The people's voice is strong.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.217
Oh, and it is true.

15:27.594 --> 15:31.014
Theirs is the voice that guides me,

15:32.266 --> 15:36.061
not those of bickering,
backstabbing,

15:36.854 --> 15:39.731
self-serving parasites.

15:39.815 --> 15:43.444
Men whose day was done
when Caesar took the throne.

15:45.446 --> 15:49.825
Clinging to power that died
with the Republic,

15:52.077 --> 15:53.704
and praying for...

15:54.705 --> 15:56.290
or plotting...

15:58.292 --> 15:59.710
my death.

16:02.796 --> 16:08.719
But the only thing that's dead
is the lie that Rome needs you.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.514
So on the first day
of the new year,

16:15.601 --> 16:17.811
I proclaim there will be a new Rome.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.982
A Rome cast in my image.

16:22.065 --> 16:25.068
- This is outrageous!
- I am the Emperor!

16:27.821 --> 16:28.822
If you doubt me,

16:28.906 --> 16:30.657
then you weren't listening.

16:31.784 --> 16:34.036
The people's voice was clear.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.830
They have made their choice...

16:40.042 --> 16:41.043
and it is...

16:45.798 --> 16:46.799
Commodus.

16:49.468 --> 16:50.427
Commodus.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.263
Commodus.

16:54.264 --> 16:57.392
Commodus! Commodus!

17:00.020 --> 17:01.271
Commodus!

17:01.772 --> 17:06.568
Commodus! Commodus! Commodus!

17:16.869 --> 17:19.915
Great day to be alive, Senator.

17:32.553 --> 17:36.348
Commodus seems to
have acted increasingly dictatorially.

17:36.432 --> 17:38.642
He seems to ignore those around him,

17:38.725 --> 17:42.229
and he himself becomes more and more
 a megalomaniac.

17:45.399 --> 17:49.319
Was he alone in this?
 Had no other Emperors done that?

17:49.403 --> 17:50.654
Well, sadly, no.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.824
Other Emperors,
whether it was Caligula or Nero,

17:53.907 --> 17:55.909
had similar character traits.

18:17.848 --> 18:20.476
By rejecting the authority of the Senate,

18:23.228 --> 18:26.732
Commodus has established
total control of the Empire,

18:28.484 --> 18:31.653
and begins to transform the city
in his image.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.745
With imperial orders,

18:40.829 --> 18:43.999
the Emperor commissions
massive golden statues

18:45.125 --> 18:49.713
and renames
the months of the year after himself.

18:52.591 --> 18:55.177
And in a show of ultimate authority,

18:56.303 --> 18:59.473
nearly 1,000 years
after the founding of Rome,

19:00.641 --> 19:03.310
Commodus gives the city a new name:

19:03.393 --> 19:06.313
Colonia Commodiana.

19:12.361 --> 19:15.531
Being Emperor wasn't just simply about

19:15.614 --> 19:19.326
fulfilling duties, it wasn't just simply
about going to work on a day-to-day basis.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.829
An emperor was who you were

19:21.912 --> 19:24.248
at the absolute root of your person.

19:25.916 --> 19:28.919
And everyone and everything
 in Roman society

19:29.002 --> 19:31.880
is aimed at expressing
how great the Emperor is.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.632
Of course, that's going to affect you.

19:33.715 --> 19:36.176
It'd be impossible that
that wouldn't, in some way,

19:36.260 --> 19:38.554
begin to affect the way
that you saw yourself.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.536
As the games continue,

20:02.619 --> 20:04.538
the Emperor's show of strength

20:04.621 --> 20:06.665
begins to escalate.

20:23.724 --> 20:27.186
Commodus wanted
to appear as a gladiator. He was...

20:27.269 --> 20:29.980
taken by the notion
 of his own strength and power.

20:30.564 --> 20:34.985
And he may actually have believed
 that he was displaying...

20:35.068 --> 20:38.405
superhuman,
extra-human power and skill.

20:58.801 --> 21:01.303
Commodus! Commodus! Commodus!

21:01.386 --> 21:02.596
Hard to watch.

21:18.487 --> 21:22.074
But while the Roman people
cheer for their Emperor,

21:22.157 --> 21:26.662
what they don't realize,
is that before stepping into the arena,

21:27.079 --> 21:32.751
Commodus has made certain
that his victories are guaranteed.

21:43.095 --> 21:45.305
When Commodus appears as a gladiator,

21:45.389 --> 21:48.475
he makes sure
that he's not going to come to any harm.

21:48.559 --> 21:51.812
He made sure that his opponents
fought with dulled blades.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.823
And after a few exchanges of blows,

22:04.032 --> 22:07.286
the other gladiator
quickly fell to the floor

22:07.369 --> 22:09.872
understanding what was best for him.

23:13.185 --> 23:15.229
I will endure to be burned,

23:15.813 --> 23:17.981
to be bound, to be beaten,

23:19.525 --> 23:21.193
to be killed by the sword.

24:21.003 --> 24:22.588
No more worry in your eyes.

24:23.422 --> 24:24.840
Now that this is done.

24:25.966 --> 24:29.970
Commodus! Commodus!

24:34.266 --> 24:35.559
Listen to them.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.103
They're still calling your name.

24:41.565 --> 24:44.193
If I could give them
14 more days, I would.

24:46.987 --> 24:51.200
And you wouldn't have to worry,
because I cannot be defeated.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.577
So it would seem.

24:55.996 --> 24:56.997
Narcissus.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.999
Sorry, Emperor,
I didn't mean to startle you.

25:00.834 --> 25:03.629
You of all people should know better
than to sneak up on a gladiator,

25:05.214 --> 25:08.592
especially one with the blood
of his vanquished opponent

25:08.675 --> 25:10.219
still fresh on his blade.

25:11.887 --> 25:13.097
It was a good battle.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.058
Attilius fought valiantly.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.061
Indeed he did.

25:20.562 --> 25:21.647
They all did.

25:23.148 --> 25:25.109
It seems you trained me
too well, my friend.

25:30.364 --> 25:32.241
Did I train you to do this?

25:37.788 --> 25:39.873
You have something to say, Narcissus,

25:41.375 --> 25:42.459
you should say it.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.673
I just watched you kill...

25:48.924 --> 25:50.217
my brothers.

25:51.135 --> 25:54.638
Men who stepped onto the battlefield
 and fought with honor.

25:55.597 --> 25:56.640
And they died with it.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.268
Holding dulled blades.

26:03.647 --> 26:05.774
Is that not a good enough reason
 to spare their lives?

26:06.608 --> 26:08.110
I gave the people what they want.

26:08.193 --> 26:09.987
They want to see
 defenseless men slaughtered--

26:10.070 --> 26:11.405
Slaves!

26:14.032 --> 26:15.284
They were slaves.

26:17.202 --> 26:19.997
Slaves I gave the honor
of dying by my sword.

26:22.082 --> 26:26.170
The honor to sacrifice themselves
for the glory of my Empire.

26:26.253 --> 26:28.756
The honor to achieve immortality.

26:32.885 --> 26:37.181
So it's only because
I stand before you a freedman

26:38.599 --> 26:40.434
that you are not bringing your sword
down upon me?

26:43.854 --> 26:47.024
With only my dulled blade
to protect myself?

26:55.783 --> 26:57.201
My friend?

27:07.669 --> 27:08.754
Pick it up.

27:11.006 --> 27:13.092
-I said pick it up.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Emperor.

27:13.175 --> 27:14.843
-Get it out of my sight.
-I'm sorry.

27:18.263 --> 27:19.264
Commodus...

27:19.723 --> 27:21.266
Silence!

27:26.772 --> 27:28.440
Don't you look at me that way.

27:28.524 --> 27:29.942
Get out.

27:30.984 --> 27:31.985
Now!

27:33.112 --> 27:36.615
All of you! Out, now!

27:37.574 --> 27:38.534
Out!

28:24.413 --> 28:27.458
Commodus knows
that if his deceit is revealed,

28:28.125 --> 28:30.127
he'll lose the trust of the people

28:30.794 --> 28:33.630
and the recognition
 he believes he's earned.

28:56.320 --> 28:59.198
So he marks anyone
who knows of his plan

28:59.281 --> 29:01.742
for banishment or execution

29:02.701 --> 29:07.664
in an official royal document
known as a proscription list.

29:12.419 --> 29:17.466
Paranoia was not entirely uncharacteristic
 of the Roman Emperors,

29:17.549 --> 29:21.595
and Commodus lived in
his own little world of paranoia.

29:21.678 --> 29:25.766
He supposed everybody was
plotting against him and they were.

29:41.281 --> 29:42.574
All of them.

29:43.492 --> 29:45.828
I did as the Emperor ordered.

29:47.663 --> 29:51.708
And now that it has been revealed,
 he cannot risk that the people find out.

29:55.295 --> 29:56.713
What can we do?

30:03.887 --> 30:05.764
You were wise to come here first.

30:08.684 --> 30:10.102
But you cannot stay here.

30:13.522 --> 30:15.357
You must return to the palace.

30:15.441 --> 30:16.275
No.

30:16.358 --> 30:18.444
You must return to the palace.

30:20.863 --> 30:24.992
Tell him that you don't care
what he did,

30:25.075 --> 30:27.327
that you love him no matter what,

30:27.411 --> 30:30.038
and that's why you've come back.

30:30.956 --> 30:33.125
To prove your love.

30:47.264 --> 30:49.224
- Poison?
- For his wine.

30:50.100 --> 30:55.773
-There has to be another way.
-This is your only hope.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.779
Or would you rather wait here
 for the Praetorian Guards?

31:10.454 --> 31:15.918
The people closest to him that
ran his life lost confidence

31:16.001 --> 31:18.003
in their own physical security,

31:18.504 --> 31:23.008
and thought the only solution
is going to be to get rid of Commodus.

31:25.385 --> 31:28.222
Because what else could they do
in order to avoid

31:28.305 --> 31:30.974
being put to death themselves?

31:40.651 --> 31:41.985
For centuries,

31:42.069 --> 31:46.532
poison has been used
as a lethal weapon in the ancient world.

31:47.449 --> 31:50.744
As toxic elements found in common plants

31:50.828 --> 31:56.291
and venom from insects and snakes
can be easily disguised,

31:57.709 --> 32:01.839
effectively killing the victim
without a trace.

32:04.133 --> 32:05.300
Throughout Roman history,

32:05.384 --> 32:10.722
poison does seem to be a more insidious
form of assassination plot.

32:10.806 --> 32:12.641
You know, it's not that you're being,
you know,

32:12.724 --> 32:15.310
killed in this martial way,
or threatened in this martial way...

32:17.187 --> 32:21.066
...it's that perhaps the people that are
most intimately involved in your life,

32:21.150 --> 32:22.985
can you really trust them?

32:56.852 --> 32:58.145
Commodus.

33:00.189 --> 33:01.523
What are you doing here?

33:05.194 --> 33:06.195
Get out.

33:09.198 --> 33:10.532
You get out!

34:07.214 --> 34:08.215
Commodus.

34:09.925 --> 34:11.176
I need some water.

35:09.443 --> 35:10.360
Marcia.

35:15.699 --> 35:16.825
What happened?

35:18.452 --> 35:20.746
-What happened?
-He's throwing it up.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.043
I found this.

35:34.134 --> 35:36.887
Well, then...
We must go to Dio.

35:38.722 --> 35:39.723
You go.

36:15.592 --> 36:18.595
Of course.
 A proscription list.

36:19.304 --> 36:22.599
It includes her name, mine, Narcissus...

36:25.436 --> 36:26.645
And me.

36:27.646 --> 36:29.064
It's almost the entire Senate.

36:32.443 --> 36:35.028
As madness gives way to vengeance.

36:42.453 --> 36:43.662
Come with me.

36:56.467 --> 37:00.387
-Senator, what am I--
-Listen to me very closely.

37:01.346 --> 37:03.807
You must take this sword to Narcissus.

37:04.391 --> 37:05.768
We have no time to lose.

38:15.212 --> 38:16.296
Marcia...

38:24.805 --> 38:26.473
I spare your life...

38:28.684 --> 38:31.019
and you sentence me to death.

38:37.860 --> 38:39.278
The only way out...

38:40.571 --> 38:41.822
is through me.

38:43.907 --> 38:46.785
The only way you live...

38:48.954 --> 38:51.957
is to kill me...

38:56.336 --> 38:59.089
with your dulled blade.

39:50.849 --> 39:52.101
I...

39:53.602 --> 39:54.853
I gave you your freedom.

39:54.937 --> 39:56.563
I earned my freedom!

39:56.647 --> 39:57.481
You...

39:59.066 --> 40:02.402
-You had everything just handed to you.
-I have--

40:02.986 --> 40:05.697
You have nothing! Nothing!

40:05.781 --> 40:10.369
You have no compassion,
you have no courage.

40:10.911 --> 40:15.332
And you have no honor.

40:52.411 --> 40:57.124
The assassination of Commodus
marks the end of an era,

40:58.792 --> 41:03.672
and the dawn of widespread turmoil
throughout the Empire.

41:07.551 --> 41:12.014
For the next year,
Rome is consumed by civil war

41:12.097 --> 41:16.351
and those who plotted against the Emperor
are soon punished.

41:18.145 --> 41:24.526
Responsible for the Emperor's death,
Narcissus, a celebrated gladiator

41:24.610 --> 41:28.363
and the man who trained Commodus
to fight in the arena

41:28.447 --> 41:29.698
is executed.

41:34.328 --> 41:37.414
And within a year, Marcia,

41:37.498 --> 41:40.292
one of the most powerful
women in the Empire,

41:40.375 --> 41:43.295
and the one person
 Commodus truly trusted,

41:45.589 --> 41:50.052
is sentenced to death
by the new reigning Emperor.

42:03.107 --> 42:05.651
But Cassius Dio survives.

42:06.318 --> 42:10.322
The ambitious Senator,
who once fought to protect Commodus,

42:12.241 --> 42:15.536
will go on to write
one of the only surviving accounts

42:15.619 --> 42:18.163
of this time in the Roman Empire.

42:39.893 --> 42:42.229
In the 13 years of his reign,

42:44.731 --> 42:46.817
Commodus brought peace to Rome.

42:54.658 --> 42:56.702
But he will come to be known...

42:58.203 --> 43:03.292
as the man responsible
for an unprecedented age of chaos,

43:04.543 --> 43:06.003
betrayal,

43:06.086 --> 43:12.843
and the beginning of the fall
of the greatest empire ever known.
