00:05.005 --> 00:07.341
WHILE THIS STORY IS BASED
ON ACTUAL EVENTS,

00:07.425 --> 00:10.678
CERTAIN CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
AND DIALOGUE WERE FICTIONALIZED.

00:10.761 --> 00:14.765
ANY SIMILARITY TO ANY PERSON,
LIVING OR DEAD, IS FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.602
Help me!

00:18.686 --> 00:22.022
BARCELONA, SPAIN.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.783
Jump! Please help me!

00:35.536 --> 00:36.579
Jump!

00:58.350 --> 00:59.852
Help me!

01:55.282 --> 01:57.284
MARADONA:
BLESSED DREAM

01:57.368 --> 01:58.911
SOUTH AMERICAN

02:04.667 --> 02:08.420
Finally, after many months
of negotiations,

02:09.004 --> 02:14.301
today, the man of the hour
will be joining FC Barcelona,

02:14.385 --> 02:15.719
Diego Armando Maradona.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.430
<i>Diego Armando Maradona</i>
<i>signed with FC Barcelona</i>

02:18.514 --> 02:22.434
<i>and arrived to a crowd waiting for him</i>
<i>at El Prat Airport this week.</i>

02:30.025 --> 02:32.152
Is it hard to win the Libertadores?

02:32.236 --> 02:34.738
- How are you, sir?
- Fine. How was your trip?

02:34.822 --> 02:37.616
<i>Diego Armando Maradona is a show.</i>

02:37.700 --> 02:41.829
<i>More than 40 journalists came</i>
<i>from Buenos Aires, Argentina.</i>

02:41.912 --> 02:44.874
<i>Photographers didn't leave him alone</i>
<i>for a second.</i>

02:45.875 --> 02:47.960
What's it like to be in Spain?

02:48.043 --> 02:49.962
I've only seen the airport.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.840
<i>All airports look the same.</i>

02:52.923 --> 02:57.469
Well, Diego, you can see the madness
your arrival has triggered,

02:57.553 --> 02:59.054
what you've stirred up.

02:59.138 --> 03:03.767
All these people expect you to repay
the money we've paid for you with titles.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.853
- You're putting pressure on me.
- Well.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.689
No, no, forget about them.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.901
No, we've set up
a press conference at the club.

03:11.984 --> 03:15.279
Diego, you came to a team
going through a losing streak,

03:15.362 --> 03:18.699
that hasn't won a major title in years,
is that extra pressure?

03:18.782 --> 03:22.494
What? Nuñez told me this was
the most successful team in Europe.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.914
Jorge, get a plane, let's go back to Boca.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.749
- Who is this?
- Is Gonzalo.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.126
A cameraman we brought with us.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.462
We're filming Maradona's documentary.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.381
Okay, Jorge, no, this is not Argentina.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.508
Barcelona isn't Boca.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.886
You can't do whatever you want here.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.180
There are procedures to follow.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.892
For example, statements for the media
can't be improvised.

03:44.975 --> 03:49.647
There's a press office
that decides where and when.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.191
So, if we want to get along,

03:52.274 --> 03:54.526
we should start off on the right foot.

03:54.610 --> 03:58.030
Asking that of Diego Maradona
would be contradictory.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.282
Better to start with the left.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.494
There was a lot of expectation
for the World Cup,

04:03.577 --> 04:05.955
but Argentina went out unceremoniously.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.540
Are you afraid that might happen
here?

04:08.624 --> 04:10.250
You had to be Argentinian.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.502
Of course.

04:11.669 --> 04:15.381
In my country,
journalists did a lot of damage.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.341
They said we were winning the war,

04:17.424 --> 04:19.510
while in the Falklands, kids were dying.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.428
I'm done with the Argentinian press.

04:21.512 --> 04:24.014
- No more questions.
- About the Falklands...

04:26.350 --> 04:29.228
- Is this the house you rented for us?
- Yes.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.271
- What do you think?
- I love it.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.569
- What, Morsa?
- Wait.

04:37.653 --> 04:41.490
Let me see this. I can't believe
the place you've got here.

04:41.573 --> 04:44.743
Mari, ask Kitty for the camera!

04:44.827 --> 04:47.871
Mari, give Kitty the camera
so she can take a picture!

04:47.955 --> 04:51.333
Wait, the van's waiting for you
to leave with the club.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.627
Come, take a picture for my folks.

04:53.711 --> 04:57.506
- These South Americans are so uncivilized.
- Yes.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.341
Mariano, honk the horn.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.636
Yes! Yes!

05:02.761 --> 05:03.804
Let's go!

05:04.972 --> 05:08.892
Remember when I told you
I thought Nuñez was an asshole?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.519
- Yes.
- It's now confirmed.

05:53.896 --> 05:57.691
Columbus conquered America,
but we'll conquer Europe, my friend.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.526
You know where I come from.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.531
Do you know how many times I hurt my foot

06:05.449 --> 06:07.326
from playing barefoot?

06:07.409 --> 06:09.495
You're here because you deserve it.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.499
- It's a miracle.
- No, it's not a miracle.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.586
It's a reward
for your effort and talent.

06:18.504 --> 06:19.630
It's thanks to you.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.473
Don't get mushy, they're watching us.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.141
I don't give a shit.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.351
All right, gentlemen,

06:32.434 --> 06:35.896
let's get going, the coach is waiting
in the locker room.

06:37.815 --> 06:39.066
Your teammates.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.277
- Urruti, the goalkeeper.
- Nice to meet you.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.695
- Welcome, Diego.
- Thanks.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.073
- José Manuel Martínez Toral.
- Pleasure.

06:46.156 --> 06:46.990
Likewise.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.077
And this is the other foreigner
on the team, Bernd Schuster.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.912
The German Nibelung.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.373
- What's up, Bernie?
- I'm great, Diego.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.959
What does he eat?
Steel? Look at his size.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.378
- Gerardo.
- Pleasure.

06:59.461 --> 07:00.963
Sánchez, the captain.

07:01.046 --> 07:01.880
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.049
And this is our great strategist,

07:04.133 --> 07:06.009
he's German like Bernd.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.970
The coach, Udo Lattek.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.972
Udo Lattek. Nice to meet you.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.849
- Pleasure.
- Let me.

07:12.558 --> 07:15.727
It's a pleasure, Diego...

07:15.811 --> 07:17.437
To have... What was it?

07:17.521 --> 07:19.106
- To have.
- You do it.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.024
It's a pleasure to have you here.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.195
I hope we will get along well.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.198
We will, as long
as the translator is here.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.625
If you're a pro and you work hard,

07:38.709 --> 07:41.128
you'll have no problems
adapting to my team.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.629
That won't be a problem.

07:43.589 --> 07:44.798
I have a question.

07:45.549 --> 07:49.386
Who shouts out instructions during a game,
you or the translator?

07:55.851 --> 07:56.894
No one shouts.

08:00.230 --> 08:04.026
He doesn't shout because his players
know exactly what to do.

08:04.902 --> 08:07.446
Okay, all right. Nice to meet you.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.037
Tactical order.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.831
Athletic ability.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.334
Collective discipline.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.218
That's the identity he wants
for FC Barcelona.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.928
He knows you're tired,

09:13.011 --> 09:15.806
You have to be,
otherwise you're doing it wrong.

09:16.515 --> 09:19.518
You're here because you were chosen
for being the best.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.146
The best are still at...

09:23.230 --> 09:26.441
If you came here thinking
you'd actually play soccer, forget it.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.527
We didn't even touch a ball.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.697
Luckily, because he uses 20-pound balls.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.241
To strengthen the legs.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.576
That's all for today. You can go.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.787
We'll see you tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.123
here at the field, as usual.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.458
You train at 7:00 a.m. every day?

09:43.542 --> 09:45.043
Even on game days.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.923
By the way, Jorge, I was told

09:50.007 --> 09:52.968
it'd be better
if you didn't stay for practice.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.221
I don't see the problem.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.307
I was quiet the whole practice.

09:58.390 --> 10:01.393
Yes, it's just a request from the coach.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.811
Really?

10:02.894 --> 10:04.646
I've been with Diego for 10 years,

10:04.730 --> 10:06.565
- this has never happened to me.
- Yes.

10:06.648 --> 10:10.777
I understand Mr. Lattek
doesn't want to favor any players.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.238
Of course, don't worry.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.365
- I won't come back.
- Okay.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.498
What's up, Rengo?

10:24.458 --> 10:25.500
It's nothing.

10:25.584 --> 10:26.710
You look upset, why?

10:26.793 --> 10:28.503
They don't want me at practice.

10:28.587 --> 10:31.715
- He said that?
- No, relax, Diego, it's the coach.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.925
Oh, him? Hey, Udo!

10:34.009 --> 10:36.386
- This is on day one?
- Relax, Diego.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.221
Don't make a fuss about this.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.183
They've been kicking me
in the head from the get-go.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.518
Relax, Pelusa.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.646
It's not like I'm dying to see
guys doing push-ups.

10:46.730 --> 10:50.400
The important thing is that you had
your debut practice with Barcelona.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.653
I'm so proud. Give me a hug, man.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.782
I'm very happy.

10:56.865 --> 11:02.704
I'm sure Barcelona is heading to one
of the best periods in its history.

11:03.372 --> 11:07.042
<i>Towards winning the title</i>
<i>we've been fighting for a long time.</i>

11:07.125 --> 11:10.003
<i>We can boast that we have</i>
<i>the best player in the world.</i>

11:10.087 --> 11:11.922
<i>In a sold-out stadium,</i>

11:12.005 --> 11:15.342
<i>Diego Armando Maradona makes</i>
<i>his debut wearing blue and red.</i>

11:15.425 --> 11:20.097
<i>This afternoon is not only the start</i>
<i>of Maradona's destiny in Europe,</i>

11:20.180 --> 11:25.560
<i>but also Josep Lluís Nuñez's future</i>
<i>as head of FC Barcelona is at stake.</i>

11:26.812 --> 11:29.564
<i>A few moments before the game starts,</i>

11:29.648 --> 11:33.819
<i>and Diego Maradona greets</i>
<i>his compatriot Mario Alberto Kempes,</i>

11:33.902 --> 11:38.281
<i>Maradona's partner on the national team,</i>
<i>and and idol of Valencian fans.</i>

11:38.365 --> 11:41.618
<i>The game starts</i>
<i>with Diego Armando Maradona.</i>

11:41.701 --> 11:43.161
<i>It's the Argentinian's debut.</i>

11:43.245 --> 11:47.416
<i>Maradona is being marked by Kempes,</i>
<i>a duel between compatriots.</i>

11:47.499 --> 11:49.960
<i>Maradona keeps going, ball in the area.</i>

11:50.043 --> 11:53.130
<i>The goal is unguarded.</i>
<i>It's wide open for Maradona,</i>

11:53.213 --> 11:55.215
<i>it's a goal! Goal for Barcelona.</i>

11:55.298 --> 11:58.677
<i>It's Diego Armando Maradona's first goal!</i>

11:59.928 --> 12:02.722
<i>Watch out, Valencia attacks</i>
<i>with Tendillo. Goal!</i>

12:02.806 --> 12:05.559
<i>Goal for Valencia! Tendillo. It's a tie!</i>

12:05.642 --> 12:08.895
<i>Ball in the area, and it's Idigoras,</i>
<i>another goal!</i>

12:08.979 --> 12:12.899
<i>Valencia beats Barcelona 2-1</i>
<i>on Diego Armando Maradona's debut.</i>

12:12.983 --> 12:16.153
<i>Maradona is a great player,</i>
<i>there's no doubt about it.</i>

12:16.236 --> 12:19.614
<i>But soccer is a sport of 11 against 11.</i>

12:20.198 --> 12:24.870
<i>Come on. Jorge, will he be here all day?</i>
<i>He's even filming me taking a shit.</i>

12:24.953 --> 12:29.624
<i>I've been thinking of bringing Galíndez</i>
<i>over to help me with the ankle thing.</i>

12:29.708 --> 12:31.293
<i>This is Néstor.</i>

12:31.376 --> 12:33.879
<i>He takes me for rides,</i>
<i>he drives me around,</i>

12:33.962 --> 12:38.800
<i>-and he fucks lots of Galician girls.</i>
<i>-That's what they say.</i>

12:38.884 --> 12:42.888
<i>Osvaldito and I were</i>
<i>in little league together. Look at him.</i>

12:42.971 --> 12:44.639
<i>This is Morsa.</i>

12:44.723 --> 12:47.267
<i>My brother-in-law.</i>
<i>No one knows how he got here,</i>

12:47.350 --> 12:49.186
<i>or why he came, but...</i>

12:49.269 --> 12:51.062
<i>You can see that...</i>

12:51.354 --> 12:55.317
<i>My mom put him in a suitcase</i>
<i>to get him out of her way.</i>

12:55.525 --> 12:58.820
<i>Yeah, sure, suck on this. Oh, sorry!</i>

12:58.904 --> 13:00.655
<i>This is Rengo.</i>

13:00.906 --> 13:04.034
<i>This is a very fancy neighborhood</i>

13:04.493 --> 13:06.786
<i>with narrow streets. Very nice.</i>

13:06.870 --> 13:12.209
<i>I put a Barcelona badge in the pool,</i>
<i>to honor the team.</i>

13:12.292 --> 13:15.712
<i>I use this one when it's cloudy,</i>
<i>when the weather's bad.</i>

13:15.795 --> 13:17.839
<i>When the day is nice and sunny,</i>

13:17.923 --> 13:22.719
<i>I use this one, right?</i>
<i>But look at this one, look at this beauty.</i>

13:24.095 --> 13:25.931
<i>It's 200 horsepower. Listen.</i>

13:36.191 --> 13:41.696
<i>Some jealous people will say Maradona</i>
<i>wastes his money, and you know what?</i>

13:42.447 --> 13:44.950
<i>They're right, because I earn my money,</i>

13:45.033 --> 13:46.451
<i>I know how the world works.</i>

13:46.535 --> 13:48.537
<i>If you're blond with blue eyes,</i>

13:48.620 --> 13:50.997
<i>come from a good family,</i>
<i>you can do whatever.</i>

13:51.081 --> 13:54.042
<i>But if you're dark like us,</i>
<i>you'll be criticized.</i>

13:54.125 --> 13:56.586
<i>Right, guys? Let's tell it like it is.</i>

13:56.670 --> 13:58.797
<i>I thought this was only in Argentina,</i>

13:58.880 --> 14:02.259
<i>but then you come here,</i>
<i>and realize what's going on,</i>

14:02.342 --> 14:04.886
<i>because they start saying</i>
<i>Maradona isn't classy,</i>

14:04.970 --> 14:07.180
<i>the class Barcelona is used to.</i>

14:07.264 --> 14:09.933
<i>And that Maradona</i>
<i>hangs out with ugly people.</i>

14:10.016 --> 14:13.186
<i>Who the fuck do they think they are?</i>

14:13.270 --> 14:15.772
<i>They want us here, in Europe,</i>

14:15.855 --> 14:19.568
<i>for washing dishes and wiping their asses.</i>

14:19.651 --> 14:23.196
<i>Otherwise, they don't want us at all.</i>
<i>Why don't you go fuck yourselves?</i>

14:23.280 --> 14:25.282
<i>Stop breaking my balls, stop filming.</i>

14:25.365 --> 14:26.908
<i>Stop filming! Cut!</i>

14:32.872 --> 14:35.792
Let's give a warm welcome

14:35.875 --> 14:38.795
to Barcelona's amazing new player,

14:38.878 --> 14:41.214
Diego Armando Maradona!

14:48.430 --> 14:50.640
And now I am pleased to present

14:50.724 --> 14:52.559
another Argentine talent,

14:52.642 --> 14:54.477
with a voice to fall in love to...

14:54.561 --> 14:57.314
It's Lorena Gaumón!

15:04.779 --> 15:07.490
It's a pleasure to be here
with you tonight.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.838
<i>My love</i>

15:21.921 --> 15:26.426
<i>Don't worry, I won't bother you</i>

15:27.427 --> 15:32.098
<i>My luck was out, I know</i>

15:32.724 --> 15:38.313
<i>And I know there's a storm</i>
<i>Running through your mind</i>

15:38.396 --> 15:40.732
<i>My love</i>

15:41.024 --> 15:45.612
<i>Our encounter was just by chance</i>

15:46.112 --> 15:50.325
<i>Same time, same boulevard</i>

15:51.493 --> 15:57.082
<i>Don't be afraid, don't worry</i>
<i>I don't blame you for the past</i>

15:57.165 --> 16:01.795
<i>You see, life is like that</i>

16:02.212 --> 16:07.592
<i>You'll leave and I'll stay here</i>

16:07.676 --> 16:12.138
<i>It will rain</i>
<i>And I will no longer be yours</i>

16:12.806 --> 16:18.645
<i>I'll be the cat in the rain</i>

16:18.770 --> 16:22.565
<i>And I will meow for you</i>

16:31.825 --> 16:34.202
<i>My love</i>

16:34.786 --> 16:39.582
<i>I know, don't say anything</i>

16:39.666 --> 16:45.088
<i>If you see any tears, I'm sorry</i>

16:45.547 --> 16:51.052
<i>I know you didn't want to make</i>
<i>A wounded cat cry</i>

16:51.136 --> 16:53.596
<i>My love</i>

16:53.680 --> 16:58.560
<i>If we ever see each other</i>

16:59.185 --> 17:03.606
<i>Buy me a coffee and make love to me</i>

17:04.274 --> 17:06.526
<i>And if I never see you again</i>

17:06.609 --> 17:09.696
<i>I hope you're lucky</i>

17:09.821 --> 17:14.492
<i>You see, life is like that</i>

17:14.951 --> 17:19.622
<i>You'll leave and I'll stay here</i>

17:20.123 --> 17:24.961
<i>It will rain</i>
<i>And I will no longer be yours</i>

17:25.462 --> 17:31.259
<i>I'll be the cat in the rain</i>

17:31.509 --> 17:36.598
<i>And I will meow</i>

17:36.681 --> 17:40.351
<i>For you</i>

17:55.533 --> 18:00.205
<i>And I will meow for you</i>

18:10.131 --> 18:11.299
Yes, come in.

18:19.516 --> 18:20.767
Look who it is.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.603
My guest of honor.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.231
Diego Armando Maradona.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.109
- Nice to meet you, Diego.
- Pleasure.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.987
- Did you like the show?
- Yes, it was great.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.697
You know...

18:35.782 --> 18:37.325
We have a lot in common.

18:37.909 --> 18:38.743
Really?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.704
How do you know? We just met.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.123
We're Argentinians,

18:45.208 --> 18:47.126
we both came to conquer Europe.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.711
You like boleros,

18:49.712 --> 18:51.422
- and I like you.
- No, no.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.716
I didn't come to conquer.

18:54.717 --> 18:57.220
I just came to enjoy
what I do. That's all.

18:59.013 --> 18:59.931
I did.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.730
Want to go out?

19:10.525 --> 19:11.985
An ambiguous question.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.280
You mean go out someday?

19:16.531 --> 19:18.241
Or get out of here right now?

20:04.662 --> 20:05.872
Nice building.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.707
Must be beautiful inside.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.751
Don't even think about it.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.419
- Why not?
- You can't.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.672
- Not even for a cup of coffee?
- No coffee for you.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.425
Don't look at me like that.
You have practice

20:17.508 --> 20:19.177
and coffee will keep you up.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.845
You better go to sleep.

20:21.429 --> 20:24.098
You barely know me
and you're taking care of me.

20:24.182 --> 20:27.644
I'm not. I'm taking care of myself.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.065
- Thanks for the lift.
- You're welcome.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.733
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.248
You're terrible.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.544
You'll have to wait for more.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.466
- See you.
- Bye.

21:23.825 --> 21:24.867
Motherfuckers.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.765
Roll down the window.

21:53.980 --> 21:57.233
What's up, guys?
Can't you leave me alone for one night?

21:57.567 --> 22:00.111
Which paper are you from?
Do you want money?

22:00.319 --> 22:03.614
- Give me the film, I'll pay.
- Diego, we're not reporters.

22:08.286 --> 22:09.120
I know you.

22:10.288 --> 22:11.622
I saw you at the club.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.042
We work for Nuñez.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.044
He sent you to follow me?

22:21.591 --> 22:23.468
Son of a bitch.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.180
Tell me something.

22:28.139 --> 22:31.059
Do the other players have
two assholes following them?

22:32.351 --> 22:33.436
Just you.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.491
- Look at that ass, baby.
- Don't talk to her like that.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.202
- They were with Maradona earlier.
- Those guys?

22:49.285 --> 22:51.829
Fucking South Americans,
stealing our girls.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.790
Throw some ice at that asshole.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.543
Let's toast to you not being rude.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.714
What the fuck is going on here?

23:01.839 --> 23:04.717
- Fine.
- Relax. He's drunk. Let him be.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.803
- All right.
- Go back to your country,

23:06.886 --> 23:08.304
South American scum.

23:10.181 --> 23:12.183
This... This...

23:12.266 --> 23:14.477
Did he call me South American scum?

23:14.560 --> 23:16.604
- Wait.
- Fucking asshole.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.148
- Relax.
- Are you... He's talking to me.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.317
Come on, man.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.196
Why don't you get your mom
to teach you how to drink, huh?

23:39.085 --> 23:42.004
MARADONA
WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS

23:44.423 --> 23:47.426
MARADONA
IS HE WORTH OUR PESETAS?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.430
MARADONA IS EXPENSIVE
BUT GIVES HIS ALL

24:06.362 --> 24:07.613
You're late.

24:09.699 --> 24:11.075
Only 10 minutes, boss.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.745
Do you think I paid seven million dollars
for you to go out partying?

24:14.829 --> 24:15.997
I wasn't partying.

24:16.455 --> 24:20.084
- I was only there for two hours.
- It says you were in a fight.

24:20.168 --> 24:22.295
That's a lie. I wasn't in the fight.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.547
You can ask your spies.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.883
Do you have a problem with me?

24:26.966 --> 24:28.217
It's not personal.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.511
I'm looking out for the club's interests.

24:30.595 --> 24:35.474
South American players aren't known
for their good behavior off the field.

24:35.558 --> 24:38.728
- That's why I'm keeping an eye on you.
- Let's do this.

24:39.687 --> 24:40.605
From now on,

24:41.355 --> 24:44.525
whatever you have to say to me,
say it to my manager.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.231
Fucker, what are you doing? I'll kill you!

25:23.314 --> 25:26.400
Stop, Diego! It's me, don't hit me, man!

25:27.693 --> 25:29.070
What are you doing here?

25:29.153 --> 25:32.698
- Jorge didn't tell you?
- He didn't. I'm so glad you're here.

25:33.074 --> 25:35.243
It's so nice to see you.
How are you? Okay?

25:35.493 --> 25:36.827
What are you wearing?

25:37.078 --> 25:38.454
I didn't know it'd be cold.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.122
- Let's have some <i>mates.</i>
- No.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.749
Come on. Nice house, huh?

25:41.874 --> 25:44.502
- Yes.
- Did you have a nice trip?

25:44.627 --> 25:47.338
- Kind of. Yes. It was fine.
- Are you hungry?

25:56.430 --> 25:57.265
Udo.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.024
Maradona and Schuster wanted to sleep in.

26:07.358 --> 26:09.777
They'll be here later
for the technical talk.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.952
Tell them to stop running

26:18.035 --> 26:20.329
- and to start with the exercises.
- Yes.

26:20.538 --> 26:23.165
Stop running and stretch.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.515
Diego Maradona.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.367
I don't know what you're saying,

26:58.492 --> 27:01.579
but you're mad
because Bernie and I slept in, right?

27:06.625 --> 27:10.671
Mr. Lattek is upset
about your and Mr. Schuster's absence

27:10.796 --> 27:12.631
from morning training.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.217
Let me explain you something.

27:15.468 --> 27:18.387
I'll talk on behalf of Bernie,
as he agrees with me.

27:23.184 --> 27:26.354
On game days, we need the extra sleep.

27:26.437 --> 27:29.607
If we're tired,
we won't play well, understand?

27:35.571 --> 27:38.824
I already told you, but you won't give in.

27:42.161 --> 27:46.248
This is the last time because
it's stressing me out. I need to sleep.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.628
Stressing you out?

27:51.045 --> 27:53.714
Yes, I'll keep on thinking about it.

27:53.798 --> 27:55.883
- I'll be mad because of it.
- Thanks.

28:02.390 --> 28:05.226
Now's not the time to sleep,
it's time to train.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.978
See? It's like talking to a wall.

28:12.817 --> 28:15.736
As soon as I got out,
my balls froze. It's cold.

28:15.945 --> 28:18.155
Sleep, Bernie, sleep a little longer.

28:20.616 --> 28:25.454
<i>Today, it's Barca versus Valladolid</i>
<i>at the Camp Nou stadium.</i>

28:25.538 --> 28:30.000
<i>The public is eager to see</i>
<i>Diego Armando Maradona in the lineup.</i>

28:30.876 --> 28:33.879
<i>The players enter the field.</i>

28:34.046 --> 28:35.297
<i>There goes Diego.</i>

28:36.924 --> 28:39.802
<i>He goes over to Schuster</i>
<i>before the start of the game,</i>

28:39.885 --> 28:40.886
<i>to encourage him.</i>

28:40.970 --> 28:43.055
<i>We see the German coach, Udo Lattek,</i>

28:43.139 --> 28:46.892
<i>whose responsibility is</i>
<i>to make the Barcelona team work.</i>

28:46.976 --> 28:49.687
<i>There's Diego</i>
<i>with his supporters cheering him on.</i>

28:50.729 --> 28:52.857
Diego! Diego!

28:56.068 --> 28:59.238
<i>The game starts.</i>
<i>Barcelona and Valladolid at Camp Nou</i>

28:59.321 --> 29:01.323
<i>with Diego Maradona.</i>

29:01.407 --> 29:04.410
<i>He attacks on the left,</i>
<i>he shoots, and it's a goal!</i>

29:04.535 --> 29:06.704
<i>Goal for Barca! By Marcos Alonso.</i>

29:06.787 --> 29:08.205
<i>The score is 1-0.</i>

29:09.165 --> 29:11.041
<i>Maradona is reaching the goal area.</i>

29:11.125 --> 29:13.711
<i>The goalkeeper steps out,</i>
<i>and it's a penalty.</i>

29:13.794 --> 29:16.547
<i>The referee has called</i>
<i>a penalty for Barcelona.</i>

29:16.672 --> 29:19.341
<i>Maradona shoots... Maradona scores!</i>

29:19.425 --> 29:23.637
<i>Goal for Barcelona by penalty!</i>
<i>Barca beats Valladolid.</i>

29:26.182 --> 29:30.519
<i>Final whistle. And Barcelona</i>
<i>has won at Camp Nou, of all places.</i>

29:30.603 --> 29:32.730
<i>They have beaten Valladolid 3-0.</i>

29:32.855 --> 29:35.566
<i>Diego Armando Maradona's team celebrates</i>

29:35.649 --> 29:39.236
<i>with their fans,</i>
<i>who bow to the South American star.</i>

29:39.320 --> 29:41.238
<i>The hug with Bernd Schuster,</i>

29:41.322 --> 29:45.618
<i>and the brutal victory</i>
<i>over Valladolid, 3-0.</i>

29:53.709 --> 29:57.463
<i>Olé, olé, Diego!</i>

29:59.256 --> 30:01.926
Our Diego, who art on Earth.

30:02.092 --> 30:04.637
Our Diego, who art on Earth.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.764
Hallowed be thy left foot.

30:06.889 --> 30:08.974
Hallowed be thy left foot.

30:09.058 --> 30:10.851
Let your magic come to us.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.103
Let your magic come to us.

30:13.395 --> 30:16.732
Let your goals be remembered
on Earth as they are in Heaven.

30:16.899 --> 30:20.736
Let your goals be remembered
on Earth as they are in Heaven.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.655
<i>Give us today our daily joy.</i>

30:22.821 --> 30:25.241
<i>Give us today our daily joy.</i>

30:25.324 --> 30:27.201
<i>And forgive those journalists.</i>

30:27.409 --> 30:29.578
<i>And forgive those journalists.</i>

30:29.662 --> 30:32.706
<i>Just as we forgive the Neapolitan mafia.</i>

30:32.873 --> 30:35.918
<i>Just as we forgive the Neapolitan mafia.</i>

30:36.001 --> 30:38.295
<i>And lead us not into offside.</i>

30:38.379 --> 30:40.047
<i>And lead us not into offside.</i>

30:40.130 --> 30:41.799
<i>And deliver us from Pelé.</i>

30:41.882 --> 30:43.425
<i>And deliver us from Pelé.</i>

30:43.509 --> 30:45.052
<i>-Diego.</i>
<i>-Diego.</i>

30:47.054 --> 30:49.890
Mother of God! Mother of God!

30:51.809 --> 30:57.815
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé</i>
<i>Claudia, Claudia</i>

30:58.107 --> 31:04.071
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé</i>
<i>Claudia, Claudia</i>

31:07.241 --> 31:08.784
Who are those guys?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.286
Diego fans.

31:10.953 --> 31:13.163
They made up a prayer for fun.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.791
For fun? They're crying.

31:16.834 --> 31:19.962
They're crying because Diego is sick,
that's why.

31:22.423 --> 31:24.925
The Lord's Prayer hit them hard this time.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.477
<i>You can't get a word</i>
<i>out of that one without paying,</i>

31:35.561 --> 31:37.521
<i>and I won't give Coppola a dime.</i>

31:37.605 --> 31:39.648
What do you know about the break-in?

31:39.773 --> 31:43.527
<i>They didn't find anything.</i>
<i>They're looking for a guy who took off.</i>

31:45.362 --> 31:48.699
- Ferro Viera.
- Yes, I know him.

31:48.782 --> 31:53.579
If we catch him, it's a hell of a score.
Seems they were partying hard with Diego.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.748
They say on the way to Punta,

31:55.831 --> 31:59.293
they stopped at a hotel,
and knocked over a wall

31:59.376 --> 32:02.963
to get a pool table in. Did you hear me?

32:08.802 --> 32:09.637
Miss.

32:10.554 --> 32:11.764
May I?

32:22.441 --> 32:23.942
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.373
Thanks, Paco.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.254
Miss. Nurse.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.298
Are you Maradona's nurse?

32:46.840 --> 32:48.467
Are you Amalia Simonini?

32:49.259 --> 32:51.512
- Yes. Who are you?
- Anibal Graziano.

32:51.595 --> 32:54.181
Journalist at a big paper in Argentina.

32:54.264 --> 32:57.393
What? You want a story?
I'm not allowed to talk.

32:57.476 --> 33:02.064
No, I'm just wondering if you could take
a picture of Maradona in his room.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.400
Think of it as a job.

33:04.483 --> 33:08.696
Really, we have a lot of money
to pay for it. A lot of money.

33:33.846 --> 33:34.930
Morning, handsome.

33:36.306 --> 33:37.808
What? You couldn't sleep?

33:39.184 --> 33:40.978
I had to wake up at this time.

33:42.479 --> 33:43.313
Why?

33:44.064 --> 33:45.607
You have practice, right?

33:46.942 --> 33:48.902
You forgot Claudia is coming today.

33:53.282 --> 33:54.324
Right.

33:59.872 --> 34:00.789
What?

34:02.833 --> 34:04.209
You want me to leave?

34:05.544 --> 34:06.420
You should.

34:06.837 --> 34:08.255
Do you want to see her?

34:09.590 --> 34:10.591
Do you miss her?

34:13.886 --> 34:15.095
She's my girlfriend.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.559
I don't know.

34:22.352 --> 34:23.604
But...

34:24.229 --> 34:27.608
Claudia is the last person
I'd want to hurt in this world.

34:34.823 --> 34:37.659
- Do you want to hurt me?
- No, but if I leave you,

34:38.577 --> 34:39.661
you'd survive.

34:41.288 --> 34:42.331
Claudia wouldn't.

35:06.063 --> 35:07.189
MARADONA PRODUCTIONS

35:08.232 --> 35:10.108
- Jorgito!
- Ricardo, buddy!

35:10.484 --> 35:12.736
It's so nice to have you here!

35:12.820 --> 35:15.155
- How are you?
- I'm great. Come in.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.074
- Hello.
- Come in. Girls.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.618
- Hello, how are you?
- Come over here.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.870
I want you to meet Ricardo Suárez,

35:21.954 --> 35:25.916
- the best sports journalist in Argentina.
- No, he's lying.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.252
Don't be modest. Come on, follow me.

35:28.335 --> 35:31.338
- Excuse me.
- Welcome to our humble office.

35:31.672 --> 35:34.174
- Do you like it?
- Yes. Is this floor yours?

35:34.258 --> 35:35.717
Yes, all of it.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.220
- Do you want some <i>mate?</i>
- Okay.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.806
- All right.
- Are you making lunch?

35:40.889 --> 35:43.267
Yes, sort of.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.018
Well, it's not allowed.

35:45.227 --> 35:49.231
The janitor always tells me,
but between us, I don't give a shit.

35:49.982 --> 35:53.652
We need to improve Diego's relationship
with Catalan journalism

35:53.735 --> 35:56.446
and counter
some dirty campaigns against us.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.490
Who's running them?

35:58.574 --> 36:00.617
Pelusa thinks it's Nuñez.

36:00.701 --> 36:02.828
Barcelona's president.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.580
They're screwing us over.

36:04.705 --> 36:08.083
They say Diego parties every night,
and we are the Maradona gang,

36:08.166 --> 36:10.043
and people believe the lies.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.629
And it's because
we're South American.

36:12.754 --> 36:15.090
Catalans are very difficult.

36:15.757 --> 36:18.051
They feel superior, they're snobs.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.220
I'm worried about Diego.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.264
They say he's a party animal,

36:22.347 --> 36:25.017
and Diego is a nice guy.
He goes to bed at 9 pm,

36:25.100 --> 36:26.727
doesn't drink alcohol.

36:26.894 --> 36:28.812
And the Maradona gang...

36:29.563 --> 36:32.733
We're just four guys
who screw up sometimes.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.568
Once in a while.

36:35.944 --> 36:39.114
I don't know what to say,
I'm a sports journalist.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.658
I've never done press,
I don't know how to do it.

36:41.742 --> 36:43.118
Just say yes.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.245
Say yes, Ricardo.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.498
I want you in charge of Maradona's press.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.209
You're the only journalist Diego trusts.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.420
Stop, Diego!

36:54.963 --> 36:58.550
Claudia, come! In this house
you either fuck or get fucked!

36:58.634 --> 37:00.177
- Come on!
- Don't grab me!

37:00.260 --> 37:01.887
I miss you! Come, Claudia!

37:03.597 --> 37:05.265
No, which way will you go?

37:05.807 --> 37:07.768
- No.
- I miss you, Claudia!

37:14.983 --> 37:17.861
- I missed you so much, <i>brujita.</i>
- Me too. Yes.

37:19.029 --> 37:20.322
Slow down.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.740
Slowly?

37:22.157 --> 37:24.534
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you here? Didn't you leave?

37:24.660 --> 37:27.579
- I came back. I was shitting myself.
- Gross, Galíndez.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.750
You know I can't shit just anywhere.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.669
Go, close the door.

37:35.295 --> 37:36.922
No, wait, wait.

37:37.089 --> 37:40.425
I don't want to fuck while Galíndez
is out there. Stop.

37:40.509 --> 37:43.387
What's wrong? I'll fuck you.
Galíndez can massage you.

37:45.055 --> 37:46.932
- I missed you, <i>brujita.</i>
- Me too.

37:57.859 --> 38:00.529
Don't look at me like that.
I get embarrassed.

38:07.703 --> 38:09.204
Were you with another woman?

38:13.542 --> 38:15.168
Why would you ask me that?

38:16.878 --> 38:19.423
Of course not, I wasn't with anyone.

38:21.216 --> 38:23.552
I wasn't with anyone
because I respect you,

38:23.885 --> 38:25.178
because I choose you,

38:25.971 --> 38:28.515
because I want you to be
the mother of my children,

38:29.057 --> 38:33.437
because I want us to grow old together,
like Tota and Chitoro.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.481
Ah, you're funny?

38:37.024 --> 38:39.693
You funny? Do you know
what I do to the funny ones?

38:39.776 --> 38:41.069
I eat them all up.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.204
- Yes?
<i>-Hello, Claudia?</i>

38:51.288 --> 38:53.749
<i>We're at a nightclub,</i>
<i>we're getting beaten up.</i>

38:53.832 --> 38:56.084
<i>-Is Diego there? Put him on.</i>
- Yes, yes.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.003
Diego, wake up.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.337
- What?
- It's Galíndez.

38:59.463 --> 39:01.715
He's getting beaten up at a nightclub.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.176
- Galíndez, what's wrong?
<i>-Diego, come running.</i>

39:04.259 --> 39:07.721
<i>You have to come.</i>
<i>We're at Up and Down. They're too many.</i>

39:07.804 --> 39:09.806
Yes, I'll be right there.

39:10.474 --> 39:11.683
You're going?

39:12.434 --> 39:14.102
Want me to leave them alone?

39:40.962 --> 39:43.590
- What the hell is going on, Galíndez?
- Diego!

39:43.882 --> 39:46.218
I got you here without Claudia knowing.

39:46.343 --> 39:48.053
- Not bad, huh?
- Are you stupid?

39:48.136 --> 39:49.221
I was sleeping!

39:49.304 --> 39:52.057
I'm playing Madrid
the day after tomorrow, fucker.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.102
Diego! Diego!

39:59.856 --> 40:01.483
I hate this part.

40:02.192 --> 40:05.570
Baby, I hate it too,
but your mom is there,

40:05.654 --> 40:07.447
your dad, your life.

40:07.781 --> 40:09.825
Yes, I know.

40:10.575 --> 40:14.037
I wish I could split
and have two Claudias.

40:14.704 --> 40:17.999
- Yes, baby, we can have a threesome.
- Diego!

40:18.083 --> 40:20.127
Kidding! Are you jealous of yourself?

40:20.210 --> 40:21.086
Yes.

40:26.842 --> 40:30.720
I promise there will be no more goodbyes,
we'll always be together.

40:31.138 --> 40:32.347
- I love you.
- Me too.

40:32.973 --> 40:34.141
Go, you'll be late.

40:36.685 --> 40:38.270
- Bye.
- Have a good trip.

40:38.353 --> 40:39.354
Thanks.

40:45.527 --> 40:46.570
Love.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.698
Don't cry, man.

40:51.074 --> 40:53.076
- Have some respect, asshole.
- Hey!

40:53.702 --> 40:54.661
So rude.

41:08.216 --> 41:09.509
There.

41:09.593 --> 41:13.638
And sorry to insist,
but I was raised that way.

41:13.722 --> 41:14.973
What a pain.

41:15.056 --> 41:19.269
But it's true, the woman doesn't work,
but she's the one in charge.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.313
She raises the kids,

41:21.396 --> 41:23.440
organizes the house, she's the boss.

41:23.607 --> 41:26.318
What's so special about being
the head of a family?

41:26.401 --> 41:28.695
You say it as if it were a big prize.

41:28.778 --> 41:30.488
Men and women are equal,

41:30.572 --> 41:33.700
and all women should be happy
doing what we like to do,

41:33.783 --> 41:37.204
whether it's working, taking care
of our kids, but by choice.

41:37.287 --> 41:39.956
If my mom said she wanted
to go out and work,

41:40.040 --> 41:41.875
my dad would have divorced her.

41:41.958 --> 41:47.130
Same thing in my house.
Chitoro would break his back working

41:47.214 --> 41:50.550
and Tota would ruin her throat dictating,
but she was in charge.

41:50.634 --> 41:52.469
Man proposes, woman disposes.

41:52.636 --> 41:54.638
Chitoro couldn't do that.

41:54.721 --> 41:57.599
What a huge load of crap.

41:57.682 --> 41:59.517
You guys are just sexist.

41:59.935 --> 42:02.729
A woman can be a good mother
and go out to work.

42:02.812 --> 42:05.148
- But that takes time.
- I don't think so.

42:05.273 --> 42:08.360
I dream of having a family,
but I won't stop working.

42:08.443 --> 42:12.197
On the contrary, work would put me
in a good mood to have a family,

42:12.280 --> 42:16.159
a home, a relationship.
My career is my career.

42:16.243 --> 42:18.119
Not even for Diego Armando Maradona?

42:18.203 --> 42:20.247
For nobody, Jorgito.

42:20.330 --> 42:24.251
I can't wait for Diego to propose to me
so that I can shove my job.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.128
Only to women.

42:31.132 --> 42:33.468
You wouldn't give
anything up for me?

42:34.344 --> 42:36.846
What about you?
Would you stop playing for me?

42:37.639 --> 42:38.556
I wouldn't.

42:39.015 --> 42:40.100
See, darling?

42:40.517 --> 42:41.434
Me neither.

42:49.943 --> 42:51.403
Diego, your eyes look odd.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.739
It's your fault, you drive me crazy.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.413
Hey, what's that over there?

43:02.122 --> 43:03.873
- See?
- What?

43:03.957 --> 43:06.334
- That thing over there.
- Is it people?

43:07.127 --> 43:08.461
It's two people.

43:11.506 --> 43:13.133
- Yes, it's two people.
- Let's go.

43:13.216 --> 43:15.051
Come, Ladilla, hurry, man!

43:15.969 --> 43:18.930
They're drowning, let's go!

43:25.812 --> 43:26.646
Diego!

43:30.025 --> 43:32.610
Go get some towels. Diego!

43:34.446 --> 43:35.989
The towels, come on!

43:40.493 --> 43:42.078
- Diego!
- Come on, you got this.

43:42.370 --> 43:43.830
Be careful, Diego!

43:45.373 --> 43:47.667
Get them up there.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.295
- Over there.
- Osvaldo!

44:00.096 --> 44:03.808
Okay, are you all right?

44:03.892 --> 44:05.477
Are you okay?

44:06.311 --> 44:07.520
It's okay.

44:07.604 --> 44:09.230
Don't worry, we won't bite.

44:09.814 --> 44:12.025
They thought we were cannibals.

44:12.108 --> 44:13.943
Make her a chorizo sandwich.

44:14.027 --> 44:16.237
- I'm on it.
- Make her one.

44:16.988 --> 44:19.324
- Unbelievable.
- Okay.

44:19.449 --> 44:20.450
MARADONA'S
NEWS AGAIN

44:20.533 --> 44:21.368
CASTAWAY

44:21.451 --> 44:23.495
DIEGO AND HIS BLONDES TO THE RESCUE

44:24.537 --> 44:26.122
Motherfuckers.

44:26.623 --> 44:30.043
Instead of publishing Maradona
saved two people from drowning,

44:30.126 --> 44:34.005
they say I was on a yacht
with drugs, alcohol and naked chicks.

44:34.130 --> 44:35.423
Easy, Diego.

44:35.507 --> 44:38.468
I got the Germans, who are very grateful,

44:38.802 --> 44:41.638
to tell the story on the news.

44:41.721 --> 44:44.015
You were on a yacht
with friends, barbecue.

44:44.099 --> 44:46.101
Why don't we put Diego on the air?

44:46.810 --> 44:49.020
- The Germans will get emotional.
- Good idea.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.898
Is this bullshit I'm paying you for?

44:51.981 --> 44:56.820
Can't you see, once it's published,
people won't forget it so easily?

44:56.903 --> 44:59.072
At least they didn't
mention Lorena, Diego.

44:59.155 --> 45:01.991
I don't get what Nuñez gets
out of all of this.

45:02.075 --> 45:06.538
I talked to my journalist friends,
and Diego is right, this is all Nuñez.

45:06.621 --> 45:09.499
He wants the advertising deals
to fall through,

45:10.166 --> 45:12.168
so Diego depends on his salary.

45:12.252 --> 45:13.711
He wants us tied to him.

45:13.795 --> 45:16.339
I don't care what that motherfucker wants.

45:16.756 --> 45:18.258
I'll hit him where it hurts.

45:18.883 --> 45:22.137
When is the friendly tour?

45:26.683 --> 45:27.684
Friday the 15th.

45:31.020 --> 45:31.980
Diego.

45:32.689 --> 45:33.565
Diego!

45:35.191 --> 45:39.028
<i>Get one of those celebrity doctors,</i>
<i>the ones who like to perform,</i>

45:39.112 --> 45:42.532
so he can explain the after-effects
that Diego might have

45:42.615 --> 45:44.492
if he survives all of this.

45:44.826 --> 45:46.870
All right. I'll get on it.

45:46.953 --> 45:50.790
Do you know a Ferro Viera?
He became friends with Coppola in jail.

45:50.874 --> 45:54.335
Yes, he's been glued to Diego's ass
for a few years now.

45:54.419 --> 45:58.339
Guillermo's secretary.
Diego's personal assistant.

45:58.590 --> 46:01.009
- Yes.
- I'd publish something like this.

46:04.012 --> 46:06.473
Okay, go. Let me know when you get it.

46:07.223 --> 46:08.057
Go on.

46:10.185 --> 46:12.103
Come on, man, let me go.

46:12.187 --> 46:15.023
How much do you want?
My dad has lots of companies.

46:16.524 --> 46:19.903
- Hey, move over.
- Easy, old man.

46:20.945 --> 46:23.323
Man, I can't believe this.

46:23.656 --> 46:25.033
Guillote.

46:25.116 --> 46:27.160
Get the coke, let's do a few lines.

46:27.243 --> 46:29.287
Come on, you've got the best stuff.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.623
Quiet down.

46:31.915 --> 46:33.583
Lower your voice.

46:33.917 --> 46:37.962
Want to get your anal cavity checked
over a lousy joke?

46:39.088 --> 46:40.715
You're awesome, Guille.

46:40.840 --> 46:43.426
When I tell my folks,
they won't believe it.

46:43.968 --> 46:46.304
What did you do to end up here?

46:46.387 --> 46:48.473
Hide cocaine in a vase again, Guille?

46:48.556 --> 46:51.309
- Come on, man.
- Lying son of a bitch.

46:51.392 --> 46:53.478
Calm down, kids.

46:53.686 --> 46:57.899
- You've never seen a guy like me?
- Relax, Guillote.

46:57.982 --> 46:59.692
We're all friends here.

47:00.109 --> 47:01.277
Tell us.

47:01.569 --> 47:05.698
Is it true that you stopped for gas
while Diego was dying?

47:06.783 --> 47:07.742
Guillote.

47:08.326 --> 47:09.661
We really are friends.

47:09.911 --> 47:11.996
For you, Diego's better dead than alive.

47:12.080 --> 47:15.833
The fat man isn't bringing in money,
not even for his wife.

47:15.917 --> 47:18.962
- Hey, don't get mad.
- Son of a bitch.

47:19.921 --> 47:23.258
I can't believe my shitty luck.
Fucking assholes.

47:30.014 --> 47:32.267
Urruti, sing a capella.

47:32.767 --> 47:34.227
He started already.

47:44.153 --> 47:45.905
Eight whiskeys, just in case.

47:48.157 --> 47:51.202
Why haven't we taken the measures
to prevent this?

47:51.286 --> 47:54.205
We can say Maradona
had a personal problem.

47:54.289 --> 47:58.042
- A health problem. A relative died.
- No, Paco, don't be ridiculous.

47:58.126 --> 48:00.086
We can't go to Paris without Maradona.

48:00.753 --> 48:03.715
Who wants to watch a game
with these poor bastards?

48:05.133 --> 48:06.217
The car is here.

48:06.301 --> 48:08.136
Look, here he comes.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.550
Where the fuck is Maradona?

48:48.217 --> 48:50.094
- Maradona isn't coming.
- What?

48:50.178 --> 48:53.723
He learned about an unfair
situation for his teammates

48:53.806 --> 48:55.475
and won't accept it.

48:55.558 --> 48:57.810
- What are you saying?
- In order to travel,

48:58.686 --> 49:01.230
- Maradona has one condition.
- Condition?

49:01.314 --> 49:05.485
He gets a bonus for every game won,
but none of his teammates do.

49:05.568 --> 49:09.197
He wants everyone to get the same bonus
for a victory as he does.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.448
He's lost it.

49:10.990 --> 49:12.784
He can't make demands.

49:12.867 --> 49:15.411
- That can't be allowed.
- Then he's not coming.

49:15.495 --> 49:18.039
I don't know
if Maradona's decision is right,

49:18.122 --> 49:20.583
I came here to tell you
his requirements.

49:20.667 --> 49:24.545
You should if Barcelona
needs Maradona for these games or not.

49:24.629 --> 49:26.381
Have I treated him badly?

49:26.839 --> 49:29.133
Haven't I spent every penny on him?

49:31.636 --> 49:33.304
All right, tell him to come,

49:33.388 --> 49:35.765
we'll pay the whole team
the same bonus as him.

49:35.848 --> 49:37.975
There is one more small detail.

49:38.768 --> 49:41.854
- He wants everything in writing.
- Take care of this.

49:44.691 --> 49:47.568
It's all here. You don't have
to do anything, just sign.

49:57.120 --> 49:59.664
Diego, Diego!

50:00.707 --> 50:01.958
Long live Barcelona!

50:03.000 --> 50:04.168
Hurray!

50:18.766 --> 50:22.145
OH LA LA! PARIS AT NIGHT
THEY PLAYED HARD AND PARTIED HARDER

50:24.856 --> 50:27.525
<i>The photos that have</i>
<i>appeared in the newspapers</i>

50:27.608 --> 50:32.947
<i>were taken as part of a celebration</i>
<i>for the Barcelona's wins.</i>

50:33.030 --> 50:34.073
NON STOP PARTYING

50:34.157 --> 50:37.493
But they don't represent
the philosophy of our club,

50:37.577 --> 50:40.705
<i>so I'm going to have</i>
<i>a conversation with Maradona.</i>

50:40.788 --> 50:42.039
NUÑEZ - MARADONA
AT WAR?

50:47.587 --> 50:50.089
I can do what I want, when I want,

50:50.173 --> 50:52.884
as long as it doesn't affect
my performance...

50:52.967 --> 50:54.761
MARADONA AND BARCELONA
OUT PARTYING

50:54.844 --> 50:56.471
<i>...it's no one's business.</i>

50:57.930 --> 50:59.974
PARTY AFTER PARTY!
BARCELONA'S SEASON

51:00.057 --> 51:02.018
GIRLS AND ALCOHOL,
IT CAN'T GO ON.

51:04.645 --> 51:07.190
ARGENTINIAN STAR IS IN GOOD COMPANY

51:07.732 --> 51:10.485
I've already read the remarks
about his glassy eyes.

51:10.568 --> 51:11.944
WILL THERE BE A MEETING?

51:12.028 --> 51:13.654
I'll ask Diego to explain.

51:13.738 --> 51:18.284
<i>Glassy eyes? What are you saying, man?</i>
<i>That I drink alcohol?</i>

51:18.367 --> 51:20.828
That I take drugs?
Come on, don't lie to people.

51:20.912 --> 51:23.998
If he doesn't change his attitude,
he'll find another club.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.042
Why did Nuñez hire me?

51:26.125 --> 51:28.211
To play soccer or to persecute me?

51:28.294 --> 51:30.338
That'll be all. No more comments.

51:30.421 --> 51:34.258
Let's talk soccer, man.
Call me when you want to talk soccer.

51:34.342 --> 51:36.052
I'm done. Excuse me.

51:45.353 --> 51:48.856
<i>At Camp Nou,</i>
<i>it's Barcelona versus Celta de Vigo.</i>

51:48.940 --> 51:50.733
<i>The ball goes to Maradona,</i>

51:50.817 --> 51:53.945
<i>he makes an attempt,</i>
<i>but the defender makes a strong entrance.</i>

51:54.028 --> 51:57.198
<i>We see the pain</i>
<i>in the Argentine star's face.</i>

51:57.281 --> 52:00.701
<i>Coach Lattek calls</i>
<i>for a substitution immediately.</i>

52:01.285 --> 52:04.038
<i>Maradona is on the ground,</i>
<i>and he looks fed up.</i>

52:07.583 --> 52:09.752
What's with the long faces?

52:10.670 --> 52:12.296
Who knows? I'm not in pain.

52:13.381 --> 52:14.841
Are you pregnant?

52:15.508 --> 52:17.009
Be serious, Rengo, come on.

52:19.846 --> 52:21.514
How long do I have to live?

52:22.849 --> 52:25.893
Blood tests reveal
acute type B viral hepatitis.

52:28.479 --> 52:29.313
What?

52:31.023 --> 52:33.025
Hepatitis B's the mildest, right?

52:33.109 --> 52:36.153
It's the most dangerous one.
Difficult to cure.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.823
You'll have to get absolute rest.

52:38.906 --> 52:42.076
The nutritionists at the club
will outline a diet,

52:42.159 --> 52:46.205
and your muscles might suffer some kind
of atrophy due to lack of exercise.

52:46.873 --> 52:50.835
So, we'll be looking at the need
for rehabilitation, okay?

52:51.586 --> 52:53.212
- Okay.
- Thanks, Doc.

52:56.799 --> 53:01.846
CONFIRMED: IT'S HEPATITIS!
DIEGO MARADONA CANNOT PLAY

53:17.528 --> 53:18.946
LATTEK OUT, MENOTTI IN

53:20.823 --> 53:22.158
Happy?

53:22.241 --> 53:23.492
I am now.

53:23.659 --> 53:25.119
Flaco is the best.

53:26.162 --> 53:29.373
Lattek, you stupid asshole.

53:30.833 --> 53:33.085
He can go back to Germany
and eat sausages.

53:40.259 --> 53:41.385
Who's that?

53:44.013 --> 53:45.097
Bilardo?

53:54.732 --> 53:56.943
Easy, Carlos, you'll hurt yourself.

54:04.450 --> 54:06.035
It's very hot.

54:06.118 --> 54:07.995
It was hard to find you, Diego.

54:09.705 --> 54:13.209
You came all this way to meet me?

54:13.668 --> 54:17.088
- Did you like me?
- Yes. Very much.

54:17.171 --> 54:19.382
But I was sure I would.

54:19.465 --> 54:21.467
I didn't just come to meet you.

54:22.051 --> 54:24.720
To me, it's Maradona and 10 others.

54:24.804 --> 54:27.723
The national team, I mean.
Maradona and 10 others.

54:28.140 --> 54:29.141
What do you say?

54:31.060 --> 54:32.937
Carlos, I won't lie.

54:33.604 --> 54:36.190
I don't know if I'll get back
to the same level.

54:36.273 --> 54:37.608
You won't.

54:38.067 --> 54:39.402
You'll be even better.

54:39.860 --> 54:40.945
And I'll help you.

54:41.487 --> 54:44.657
I know your soccer taste is Menotti.

54:45.032 --> 54:46.993
We're different.

54:47.076 --> 54:50.579
We work differently,
but we agree on something.

54:50.663 --> 54:53.874
We all want to win,
but we have to make a pact.

54:53.958 --> 54:55.710
From my side, total freedom.

54:56.168 --> 54:58.629
You're friends with whoever, I don't care.

54:59.505 --> 55:02.633
You train, I'll help, you do you. But...

55:03.175 --> 55:05.261
You have to be loyal to me.

55:05.928 --> 55:08.931
Why? The press wants Menotti,
they don't want me.

55:09.015 --> 55:12.184
- They'll destroy us.
- Exactly, so, when it's needed,

55:12.351 --> 55:15.771
I need the best player in the world
to defend me.

55:16.313 --> 55:19.984
But I didn't just come to meet you,
I brought you something.

55:22.153 --> 55:23.279
I brought you this.

55:27.908 --> 55:29.410
You're my captain.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.051
What do you say?

55:54.310 --> 55:56.145
Yes, there you go.

55:58.814 --> 55:59.940
So?

56:00.649 --> 56:01.776
How does it feel?

56:03.736 --> 56:06.989
I feel like I'm wearing Superman's cape.

56:07.740 --> 56:09.909
Yes, you are Superman.

56:10.576 --> 56:14.622
Listen, let's take a walk,
I'll tell you about the project.

56:14.955 --> 56:17.750
It's different.
At first, you won't understand,

56:17.833 --> 56:19.627
but it will become clear to you.

56:19.710 --> 56:22.254
Come on, let's walk for a while.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.925
- What about Passarella?
- He's good.

56:26.008 --> 56:30.721
Passarella is a great player,
but he's the former coach's captain.

56:30.805 --> 56:32.598
You are my captain.

56:39.230 --> 56:42.483
Hepatitis left Diego Maradona
inactive for three months.

56:42.566 --> 56:45.820
The Catalan press harassed him,
spreading false rumors.

56:46.612 --> 56:50.324
They claimed his eyes were yellowish
due to drug consumption,

56:50.407 --> 56:52.618
that he had a venereal disease,

56:52.701 --> 56:56.914
that he suffered from gonorrhea
and would never play soccer again.

56:57.373 --> 57:00.417
Coaches Carlos Bilardo
and his predecessor, Cesar Menotti,

57:00.501 --> 57:03.546
started a battle of styles
that continues to this day.

57:03.796 --> 57:06.841
Menotti's supporters favor
an offensive and ostentatious game

57:06.924 --> 57:12.471
while Bilardo's, strategy and sacrifice.
The end (victory) justifies the means.

57:13.430 --> 57:15.141
<i>Diego, at 21 years of age,</i>

57:15.266 --> 57:18.561
<i>how does it feel to be constantly</i>
<i>surrounded by the public,</i>

57:18.644 --> 57:20.896
by fans, by police protection,

57:21.021 --> 57:23.315
by so many people who want to touch you,

57:23.399 --> 57:24.942
hug you, shake your hand?

57:26.652 --> 57:31.782
First of all,
I don't need police protection

57:31.866 --> 57:34.201
to walk down the street, I don't need...

57:34.994 --> 57:40.958
Anyone. People love me,
and I love people too.

58:01.437 --> 58:05.232
In 1983, when I took charge
of the national team,

58:05.858 --> 58:09.653
I went to Barcelona to see Maradona,
and told him he'd be captain.

58:09.737 --> 58:11.614
And when I got here, I announced,

58:11.697 --> 58:14.116
"The new headliner and captain
is Maradona."

58:14.200 --> 58:18.370
I had to leave the country for 10 days.
They wanted to kill me.

58:18.913 --> 58:21.749
I said he would be
one of the best players,

58:22.374 --> 58:24.835
and people told me all kinds of things.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.796
Remember, the captain
at that time was Passarella.

58:27.880 --> 58:29.048
I recognize that.

58:29.131 --> 58:31.717
Passarella, but Maradona
would be a good player.

59:25.646 --> 59:29.275
<i>Today we're celebrating</i>
<i>Diego's pre-birthday,</i>

59:29.358 --> 59:31.777
<i>so it's Maradona Christmas Eve.</i>

59:31.860 --> 59:35.781
<i>We'll wait until 12:00,</i>
<i>then we'll count up</i>

59:35.864 --> 59:38.826
from one to 10, to 12:00,

59:38.909 --> 59:42.871
to celebrate Diego's birthday,
which is our Maradonian Christmas.
