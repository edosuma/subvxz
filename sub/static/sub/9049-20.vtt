WEBVTT

00:03.840 --> 00:04.939
Ally!

00:04.942 --> 00:06.775
Austin!

00:06.777 --> 00:09.277
It is so good to see you,
I missed you so much.

00:09.279 --> 00:11.713
Me, too. I can't believe
it's been four months.

00:11.715 --> 00:13.015
How's school?

00:13.017 --> 00:15.450
Hard, but amazing.
How's the tour?

00:15.452 --> 00:17.386
It's been fun, but
also really lonely.

00:18.489 --> 00:21.623
And, it kinda got me thinking.

00:21.625 --> 00:22.691
About us.

00:24.327 --> 00:26.995
I didn't know at
the time, but...

00:26.997 --> 00:30.365
The day I walked in the music store
was the greatest day of my life...

00:32.168 --> 00:34.236
Because it's the day I met you.

00:36.140 --> 00:38.407
There's so much about the
future I don't know,

00:38.409 --> 00:43.645
but the one thing I'm sure of is, there's
no way I can make it without you.

00:45.215 --> 00:47.416
So,

00:47.418 --> 00:49.051
Ally Willow Dawson...

00:50.320 --> 00:52.587
Will you make me the
happiest man alive and,

00:54.090 --> 00:55.223
marry me?

00:56.492 --> 00:57.893
Austin.

01:00.430 --> 01:01.463
I can't...

01:04.333 --> 01:07.335
Believe you're really
asking me to marry you!

01:07.337 --> 01:09.671
Yes, yes, I will!

01:09.673 --> 01:10.705
Wait.

01:10.707 --> 01:12.674
That never happened.

01:12.676 --> 01:15.277
First of all, Ally's
middle name isn't Willow,

01:15.279 --> 01:17.913
and more importantly, Austin
never asked Ally to marry him.

01:17.915 --> 01:21.249
I know, but what happened
in real life is too sad.

01:21.251 --> 01:23.385
So, when I was putting
together my rockumentary,

01:23.387 --> 01:25.287
<i>the Austin and Ally story,</i>

01:25.289 --> 01:28.290
I used a little editing magic to make
it look like Austin was proposing.

01:28.292 --> 01:29.413
Here's the original footage.

01:30.726 --> 01:32.661
Whoa, what kind of bug is that?

01:34.764 --> 01:36.098
Hey, I got him.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.633
Come on. Touch him, he's fuzzy.

01:38.635 --> 01:41.203
Austin, I can't...

01:41.205 --> 01:42.337
Even look at it.

01:43.539 --> 01:45.240
Ew! Ew!

01:45.242 --> 01:46.608
Gross!

01:48.412 --> 01:50.545
No audience wants to see
what really happened.

01:50.547 --> 01:52.581
You mean that Austin and
Ally actually broke up

01:52.583 --> 01:54.416
and haven't talked to
each other in years?

01:54.418 --> 01:56.952
Uh, yeah. I can't end
my movie like that.

01:56.954 --> 01:58.453
It's all so sad.

01:58.455 --> 02:00.088
You know, Ally's coming
home this weekend,

02:00.090 --> 02:02.457
and I tried to talk her into
going to Austin's show with us,

02:02.459 --> 02:04.726
she said she doesn't
even want to see him.

02:04.728 --> 02:07.496
Austin said he doesn't
want to see her either.

02:07.498 --> 02:10.465
It's so weird that after all they've
been through they can't even be friends.

02:10.467 --> 02:11.500
Tell me about it.

02:11.502 --> 02:13.401
We're friends and
we hate each other.

02:13.403 --> 02:15.470
I know, I hate you so much.

02:18.623 --> 02:21.143
I just know that if we can get
Austin and Ally in the same room,

02:21.145 --> 02:22.777
once they see each other,

02:22.779 --> 02:25.299
everything will be fine and we can
all go back to being friends.

02:26.415 --> 02:28.650
I think I know
just how to do it.

02:28.652 --> 02:30.485
Wait a sec.

02:30.487 --> 02:33.522
Is your plan an elaborate scheme that
involves lying, trickery and deceit?

02:33.524 --> 02:35.190
Of course.

02:35.192 --> 02:36.358
Then count me in!

02:36.360 --> 02:37.492
Whoo!

<i>And then, after I finished
my tour with the lion queen,</i>

03:34.151 --> 03:38.486
<i>I got cast as Maggie in the musical,
Maggie and the magic overalls .</i>

03:38.488 --> 03:41.556
<i>Overall, I'd say you're
doing really well.</i>

03:45.528 --> 03:49.431
Wow, it feels so weird
to be back here.

03:49.433 --> 03:51.700
So many memories.

03:51.702 --> 03:53.835
You mean like meeting Austin?

03:53.837 --> 03:55.670
Writing songs with Austin?

03:55.672 --> 03:57.405
Falling in love with Austin?

03:59.442 --> 04:03.345
I see what you're doing and I
don't want to talk about it.

04:03.347 --> 04:06.414
Austin is the past, I am
all about the future.

04:06.416 --> 04:10.585
Now that I'm done with college, I'm just
excited to focus on my music again.

04:10.587 --> 04:12.053
I'm really glad to
hear you say that,

04:12.055 --> 04:14.456
<i>because guess who booked you
on the Helen show this Friday?</i>

04:14.458 --> 04:17.459
<i>Wait, the Helen show?
That's amazing!</i>

04:17.461 --> 04:20.562
Your fans are dying to
hear new music from you.

04:20.564 --> 04:23.131
Wait. I'm supposed
to do a new song?

04:23.133 --> 04:25.400
Ah. I gotta warn you.

04:25.402 --> 04:28.470
School kept me so busy, my
songwriting is a little rusty.

04:28.472 --> 04:32.107
Ally, you've never written
a bad song in your life.

04:32.109 --> 04:33.174
Let's hear what you got.

04:43.452 --> 04:45.120
Oh, boy.

04:49.126 --> 04:51.259
I just wrote that at the
airport because the airline...

04:51.261 --> 04:53.194
lost your luggage.
Yeah, I get it.

04:55.464 --> 04:57.666
<i>And then Atlanta
tonight and tomorrow,</i>

04:57.668 --> 05:00.368
and then I'll be back in Miami
for my show this weekend.

05:00.370 --> 05:01.936
Can't wait to see ya, buddy.

05:01.938 --> 05:02.971
Me, too.

05:02.973 --> 05:04.472
What up?

05:04.474 --> 05:05.840
- You okay, buddy?
- Ooh.

05:05.842 --> 05:07.142
Ah, still there?

05:08.778 --> 05:12.314
<i>Hey, so you know how Trish booked
you on the Helen show this Friday?</i>

05:12.316 --> 05:14.582
<i>Yeah. It's gonna be fun to
go back on the Helen show .</i>

05:14.584 --> 05:16.418
It's kinda where it
all started for me.

05:16.420 --> 05:19.487
<i>Well, I finally finished my film,
the Austin and Ally story,</i>

05:19.489 --> 05:22.524
and I was kinda hoping you guys
would bring me out to show a clip.

05:22.526 --> 05:24.092
You guys?

05:24.094 --> 05:25.960
Ally's not gonna
be there, is she?

05:25.962 --> 05:27.028
What?

05:28.531 --> 05:31.533
No! I said, "you guy."

05:31.535 --> 05:35.603
I was hoping you guy
would bring me out.

05:35.605 --> 05:37.372
You. Guy.

05:40.176 --> 05:44.045
But, out of curiosity, would it
be a big deal if Ally was there?

05:44.047 --> 05:47.482
I mean, she's not.
But if she was?

05:47.484 --> 05:50.218
Dez, you know how hard
the breakup was for me.

05:51.487 --> 05:53.121
It's still really painful.

05:53.123 --> 05:55.223
There's no way I'm ready
to see Ally again.

05:56.325 --> 05:57.625
Hey, Dez, look who's here.

06:03.366 --> 06:04.432
Ally!

06:06.635 --> 06:07.702
That was close.

06:14.477 --> 06:17.812
<i>Welcome to the Helen show!</i>

06:20.217 --> 06:22.751
Austin moon, you're
on in 10 minutes...

06:22.753 --> 06:25.153
Is something I was supposed
to tell you nine minutes ago,

06:25.155 --> 06:26.221
so, you got one minute.

06:28.524 --> 06:31.860
Okay, buddy, just treat this like
any other talk show appearance.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.429
There's no reason to
freak out or be nervous.

06:34.431 --> 06:35.663
Why would I freak out?

06:35.665 --> 06:38.733
See, that's exactly what I'm
talking about! Calm down!

06:42.705 --> 06:46.741
<i>Oh, Trish, thank you so much for
booking me on the Helen show,</i>

06:46.743 --> 06:47.909
you're a really great friend.

06:49.445 --> 06:50.712
I am.

06:50.714 --> 06:54.749
But, remember, no matter what happens
out there on the show today,

06:54.751 --> 06:58.019
just know that I'm always trying
to be the best possible friend.

06:59.021 --> 07:02.724
The best... friend... possible.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.559
Best.

07:04.561 --> 07:05.827
Okay...

07:06.862 --> 07:08.430
Ally Dawson, you're
on in one minute.

07:08.432 --> 07:10.732
Is something I was supposed
to say 55 seconds ago,

07:10.734 --> 07:11.966
so you're pretty much on now.

07:11.968 --> 07:13.468
Oh, okay.

07:15.038 --> 07:17.639
We have an amazing
show for you tonight.

07:17.641 --> 07:21.810
I could not be more excited
to have these special guests.

07:21.812 --> 07:28.216
On stage for the first time together
in years, Austin moon and Ally Dawson!

07:31.587 --> 07:33.254
Feel the love!

07:33.256 --> 07:35.390
Together!

07:35.392 --> 07:36.624
It feels right.

07:42.766 --> 07:46.668
All right! Welcome back to
my show, Austin and Ally!

07:46.670 --> 07:48.670
- Uh-huh.
- Yep. Yeah!

07:48.672 --> 07:51.639
It is so great to have you here!

07:51.641 --> 07:53.775
Now let's have some fun!

07:55.111 --> 07:57.579
So why did you break up?

07:57.581 --> 08:00.415
- Ah, we... just...
- Um, I... I don't really...

08:00.417 --> 08:03.351
Ally, is it true that Austin
showed up at your dorm room

08:03.353 --> 08:05.854
at Harvard and spelled out,
"I'm breaking up with you,"

08:05.856 --> 08:06.856
in pickles?

08:08.824 --> 08:11.326
Ah, no. That's just... weird.

08:13.162 --> 08:15.363
Austin? Is it true
that Ally's dad

08:15.365 --> 08:18.833
paid you a million dollars
to stay away from her?

08:18.835 --> 08:20.134
- A million dollars?
- Mm-hmm.

08:20.136 --> 08:22.670
No way! Do you know how
cheap Ally's dad is?

08:24.373 --> 08:26.374
Are you making this stuff up?

08:26.376 --> 08:28.710
Actually, yes, I am.

08:30.213 --> 08:33.014
Since you two have never spoken
publicly about the breakup,

08:33.015 --> 08:36.683
all we can do is make horrible
guesses as to what happened.

08:38.721 --> 08:40.889
Look, the real story
isn't that interesting.

08:40.890 --> 08:43.390
I was constantly on tour,
Ally was busy with school,

08:43.393 --> 08:44.826
and we never had time
to see each other.

08:44.828 --> 08:45.827
Aww.

08:45.829 --> 08:50.798
It was frustrating and it was painful
to not be able to be together, so,

08:50.800 --> 08:53.201
we decided that the best thing
to do was take a small break.

08:53.203 --> 08:54.836
Mm.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.704
Then a small break turned
into a long break.

08:56.706 --> 08:58.339
Then a long break turned
into a really long break.

08:58.341 --> 08:59.841
Then a really long
break turned into...

08:59.843 --> 09:01.203
is this really
anybody's business?

09:02.579 --> 09:06.581
Well, the important thing is is that
you're both back on my show again.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.816
And who can forget Austin
and Ally's first appearance

09:08.818 --> 09:11.519
<i>on the Helen show
eight years ago?</i>

09:11.521 --> 09:12.587
Roll the clip!

09:28.504 --> 09:31.005
L-let's hear it for Ally...
everybody.

09:37.747 --> 09:41.115
I doubt anyone will ever
see a talk show appearance

09:41.117 --> 09:42.750
more uncomfortable than that.

09:42.752 --> 09:44.986
Today's pretty close.

09:48.190 --> 09:50.024
This is going great!

09:50.026 --> 09:51.426
Are you kidding me?

09:51.428 --> 09:53.461
This is a disaster!

09:53.463 --> 09:55.930
Austin and Ally are having
the worst time ever!

09:55.932 --> 09:57.432
Oh, I know.

09:57.434 --> 09:58.900
<i>I just meant this is the best
episode of the Helen show</i>

09:58.902 --> 10:01.102
that I've ever seen. Riveting!

10:02.605 --> 10:03.938
We gotta do something.

10:04.940 --> 10:07.275
I have an idea.

10:07.277 --> 10:10.912
So, how hard is it for you two
to see each other right now?

10:10.914 --> 10:11.914
Is it awful?

10:13.949 --> 10:15.783
Whoo!

10:18.454 --> 10:19.921
Thank you. Thank you.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.990
No, no, no. Thank you.

10:22.992 --> 10:24.792
- Dez?
- What are you doing?

10:24.794 --> 10:26.828
Creating a distraction.

10:26.830 --> 10:28.930
I'm sorry, who are you?

10:28.932 --> 10:30.832
My movie? Thanks for asking.

10:30.834 --> 10:33.334
I would love to talk
about my movie.

10:33.336 --> 10:35.970
<i>It's called the Austin
and Ally story .</i>

10:35.972 --> 10:37.038
Roll the clip!

10:39.174 --> 10:44.579
<i>She was a boring, shy songwriter
with no real purpose.</i>

10:44.581 --> 10:48.616
<i>Then he appeared... an incredibly
handsome, not boring rocker</i>

10:48.618 --> 10:51.085
<i>with nothing but a
corn dog and a dream.</i>

10:52.921 --> 10:55.723
<i>Oh, and also a totally
awesome best friend.</i>

10:56.859 --> 10:59.927
<i>Oh, and I forgot, the shy
girl also had a friend.</i>

10:59.929 --> 11:01.496
<i>She was lazy and rude.</i>

11:04.299 --> 11:07.368
<i>She wrote, he rocked.</i>

11:08.504 --> 11:09.871
<i>They loved.</i>

11:12.007 --> 11:14.375
I love you, Ally.

11:14.377 --> 11:16.778
I love you, too, Austin.

11:16.780 --> 11:18.613
<i>Together, they made it.</i>

11:22.718 --> 11:24.758
<i>Coming soon from the director
of claws dun dun dun .</i>

11:27.624 --> 11:30.391
Wow! Look how in
love you two were.

11:30.393 --> 11:31.459
Such a tragedy.

11:31.461 --> 11:33.061
Tell me about it.

11:33.063 --> 11:35.630
I've been reworking the
ending of my movie for years

11:35.632 --> 11:36.798
trying to make it
less depressing.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.167
Oh, powerful stuff.

11:39.169 --> 11:43.705
Stay tuned, after this commercial,
Ally's gonna perform a brand-new song.

11:47.910 --> 11:50.712
I'm sorry, I-I can't do this.

11:50.714 --> 11:51.946
Ally!

11:56.652 --> 11:58.920
You should really have me
on your show more often.

11:58.922 --> 12:00.655
We have great
on-screen chemistry.

12:14.070 --> 12:15.903
Whoo!

12:15.905 --> 12:19.574
Welcome back to my Austin
and Ally reunion special.

12:19.576 --> 12:21.609
Which I guess is now just me...

12:22.778 --> 12:24.011
And their weird friend.

12:25.714 --> 12:27.548
Thanks, Helen. I would
love to show you

12:27.550 --> 12:30.051
an exclusive interview with
the director of my movie,

12:30.053 --> 12:31.252
<i>the Austin and Ally story.</i>

12:31.254 --> 12:34.055
- Well, that's not what I...
- Roll the clip!

12:34.057 --> 12:36.924
Welcome to Dez on Dez.

12:36.926 --> 12:38.526
Hi, I'm Dez.

12:38.528 --> 12:41.929
With me, I have Dez,
renowned director.

12:41.931 --> 12:44.098
I gotta say, you're
looking good, Dez.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.133
Thank you, Dez.

12:45.135 --> 12:46.968
As are you.

12:46.970 --> 12:48.536
It's an honor to be here.

12:48.538 --> 12:52.073
Now tell me, at what point did you
first realize that you would become

12:52.075 --> 12:55.576
one of the world's most prestigious
and respected directors?

12:55.578 --> 12:57.078
From day one, really.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.147
I even directed the
video of my own birth.

12:59.149 --> 13:02.250
I saw that umbilical cord
and I yelled, "cut!"

13:09.458 --> 13:10.458
Ally, wait.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.126
Why did you do this?

13:12.128 --> 13:13.995
I'm sorry.

13:13.997 --> 13:15.463
I just miss you.

13:15.465 --> 13:16.597
And Austin.

13:16.599 --> 13:19.100
And even that red-headed doof.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.462
I just wish things could go back
to the way they used to be.

13:22.337 --> 13:24.172
I know.

13:24.174 --> 13:25.306
I get it.

13:25.308 --> 13:30.178
But I told you I wasn't ready to see
Austin, it's still too painful for me.

13:30.180 --> 13:33.247
I'm sorry I tricked you, but
this is your big comeback,

13:33.249 --> 13:35.216
you have to go out there
and sing your new song.

13:37.186 --> 13:39.187
It's not actually a new song.

13:40.422 --> 13:43.024
I lied when I said
the only songs I had

13:43.026 --> 13:45.993
were about shower shoes
and lost luggage.

13:45.995 --> 13:51.599
I wrote a bunch of other songs, too,
but they're all about me and Austin.

13:51.601 --> 13:54.869
And there's no way I can go out
there and sing one on TV now,

13:54.871 --> 13:57.271
especially not in front of him.

13:57.273 --> 14:00.908
You can't just leave. You
have to sing something.

14:00.910 --> 14:02.777
I mean, the luggage
song wasn't that bad.

14:03.846 --> 14:05.213
Ally, we need to talk.

14:07.282 --> 14:08.983
Ah, yeah.

14:08.985 --> 14:10.051
Probably should.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.754
And I probably should
give you some space.

14:20.128 --> 14:21.896
More space than this?

14:21.898 --> 14:22.964
Got it.

14:27.135 --> 14:28.636
Well...

14:28.638 --> 14:31.572
This isn't exactly how I
pictured seeing you again.

14:31.574 --> 14:33.341
Me neither.

14:35.144 --> 14:36.210
You look pretty.

14:37.546 --> 14:38.613
Thanks.

14:39.982 --> 14:41.449
You look pretty, too.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.252
Thanks.

14:44.254 --> 14:46.153
I've been using a new
all-natural moisturizer.

14:54.096 --> 14:55.162
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

14:56.365 --> 14:59.333
It's been weird not
having you around.

14:59.335 --> 15:01.702
We used to share everything.

15:01.704 --> 15:03.771
Well, at least I still
have your songbook.

15:05.274 --> 15:06.714
It's almost like
having you with me.

15:07.743 --> 15:09.610
You still keep it with you?

15:11.046 --> 15:12.179
Always.

15:13.849 --> 15:17.485
Look, I heard what you said to Trish
about not wanting to perform.

15:19.121 --> 15:20.187
It's...

15:20.189 --> 15:22.256
Hard to go out there
and perform...

15:22.258 --> 15:23.624
Feeling the way I do right now.

15:28.797 --> 15:32.266
You know, we always used to be able to lean
on each other to get through anything.

15:33.302 --> 15:35.036
What if we sing
your song together?

15:35.038 --> 15:36.103
As a duet?

15:38.307 --> 15:39.307
Really?

15:42.978 --> 15:44.045
Uh...

15:46.415 --> 15:47.515
I think...

15:48.750 --> 15:50.918
This one might be...

15:50.920 --> 15:51.986
Good.

15:59.428 --> 16:00.561
It's perfect.

16:02.331 --> 16:03.698
Aww.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.701
Still too close?

16:10.505 --> 16:15.042
So then I, grabbed the umbrella,
and gave it back to that walrus.

16:16.578 --> 16:18.846
Ha, ha, ha. Why are
you still here?

16:25.321 --> 16:26.721
Hey.

16:28.357 --> 16:29.790
Sorry to interrupt.

16:29.792 --> 16:32.593
Oh, great, another
uninvited guest.

16:32.595 --> 16:34.829
Do we have any
security here at all?

16:34.831 --> 16:36.697
Anyone?

16:36.699 --> 16:40.601
I just wanted to let everybody know
that Ally is ready to perform,

16:40.603 --> 16:42.436
and Austin is gonna
perform with her.

16:42.438 --> 16:45.306
Oh! That is amazing!

16:45.308 --> 16:47.875
But you know, I like to introduce
the guests on my show.

16:47.877 --> 16:50.044
- Oh, sorry.
- Yeah.

16:50.046 --> 16:53.647
Ladies and gentlemen, on stage
for the first time in years,

16:53.649 --> 16:55.649
- Austin and Ally!
- And Ally!

19:19.327 --> 19:21.395
Ally, I still love you.

19:22.364 --> 19:25.132
I never stopped loving you.

19:25.134 --> 19:26.867
I never want to be
apart from you.

19:27.802 --> 19:31.172
I want to be with
you, too, but how?

19:31.174 --> 19:32.840
No matter how much
we love each other,

19:32.842 --> 19:35.075
we always seem to be headed
in different directions.

19:36.678 --> 19:38.212
Then...

19:38.214 --> 19:40.381
Why don't we head in
the same direction?

19:40.383 --> 19:43.918
We can write, record,
perform and tour together.

19:45.153 --> 19:46.554
You mean like an official duo?

19:47.889 --> 19:49.190
Yes.

19:50.358 --> 19:51.692
What do you say?

20:02.037 --> 20:04.238
Now this is what I
hoped would happen.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.506
Man.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.508
Now I have to change the
ending of my movie.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.410
But it's so beautiful.

20:10.745 --> 20:11.845
Ho, ho!

20:11.847 --> 20:15.549
Auslly fans, rejoice!

20:17.520 --> 20:19.853
Whoo!

20:19.855 --> 20:22.089
Austin and Ally are
back together,

20:22.091 --> 20:26.360
as a couple, and as an
official singing duo.

20:26.362 --> 20:27.661
Whoo!

20:27.663 --> 20:30.264
And Ally, thanks for making
it through the whole show

20:30.266 --> 20:32.733
without destroying
my set this time.

20:32.735 --> 20:34.401
Well, ha-ha...

20:34.403 --> 20:37.771
Your new set does seem a lot
sturdier than the old one.

20:46.448 --> 20:47.514
Aah!

21:02.597 --> 21:05.466
Austin and Ally, everybody.

21:08.204 --> 21:09.270
Whoo!

21:14.876 --> 21:17.611
And people were so excited about
us getting back together,

21:17.613 --> 21:20.914
<i>that our appearance on the Helen
show actually got a billion hits.</i>

21:20.916 --> 21:23.217
After that, we went
on tour together,

21:23.219 --> 21:26.353
and when we were in Paris your
father asked me to marry him.

21:27.622 --> 21:29.590
Guess who made it to Miami!

21:29.592 --> 21:32.092
Hey, go give a hug to your
aunt Trish and Uncle Dez.

21:32.094 --> 21:33.782
- Aunt Trish!
- Uncle Dez!

21:33.813 --> 21:38.565
<i>We came straight from the set
of claws dun dun dun: Eight .</i>

21:39.602 --> 21:41.835
Okay, come on, kids.

21:41.837 --> 21:43.570
The studio gave
us a private jet.

21:43.572 --> 21:45.406
Trish is amazing in the movie.

21:45.408 --> 21:47.574
I really think she's gonna
win a best actress award.

21:47.576 --> 21:49.843
The four I've won are plenty.

21:49.845 --> 21:52.046
Ah, who am I kidding?
I want five.

21:54.516 --> 21:57.518
- Ah, there's my wife.
- Where?

21:57.520 --> 21:59.820
I'm talking about you, Carrie.
You're my wife.

21:59.822 --> 22:02.523
Phew. For a second I thought
you married someone else.

22:04.659 --> 22:06.093
Where's Darrie?

22:06.095 --> 22:08.529
He went away to college.
Didn't we tell you?

22:08.531 --> 22:10.698
College? But he's six.

22:10.700 --> 22:14.702
Ah, yeah. Our son is officially
the world's smartest kid.

22:17.205 --> 22:20.574
The scientist guy said
darrie had a 300 q.I.

22:21.543 --> 22:22.710
It's I.Q.

22:24.012 --> 22:26.513
Spelling's not really my thing.

22:26.515 --> 22:28.582
Point is, our kid's the best.

22:30.352 --> 22:31.652
Not so fast, red.

22:33.189 --> 22:34.455
With little touches of gray.

22:36.624 --> 22:38.025
Hey, wifey-poo.

22:38.027 --> 22:39.027
Hey, Chuck-a-licious.

22:42.564 --> 22:46.400
Trish and I have the best kid,
and Princess Magnolia Rose

22:46.402 --> 22:50.070
has the "little miss preschool
America pageant" trophy to prove it.

22:51.139 --> 22:53.307
Guess who won "little
miss preschool."

22:57.011 --> 22:58.812
It's so amazing to be back here.

22:58.814 --> 23:01.515
Where it all began
for the four of us.

23:01.517 --> 23:04.585
I am really glad we're
all here together.

23:04.587 --> 23:08.555
No matter where our lives take us,
we'll always be best friends.

23:11.359 --> 23:12.593
I love you guys.

23:28.076 --> 23:29.777
Wow.

23:30.945 --> 23:33.113
It's all still here.

23:33.115 --> 23:34.415
It's like we never left.

23:35.550 --> 23:37.551
Yeah.

23:37.553 --> 23:39.119
Even the old piano.

23:44.386 --> 23:46.627
Okay, we've got 18 hours to
write the greatest song ever.

24:00.809 --> 24:02.543
Remember this one?
