WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:04.296
( Wind meter squeaking )

00:05.547 --> 00:06.764
( rumbling )

00:11.678 --> 00:13.021
( snoring )

00:14.806 --> 00:16.149
( snoring )

00:24.525 --> 00:27.699
Thirty long years
and it's all led up to this.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.246
My greatest achievement!

00:30.697 --> 00:32.323
Probably
should have worn pants.

00:34.743 --> 00:35.710
Agh!

00:37.079 --> 00:38.046
( Chuckles )

00:38.205 --> 00:39.752
Feisty, I like it.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.722
If I finally
pull this off,

00:50.884 --> 00:52.431
it will all have been
worth it.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.851
I just need to keep
playing it cool.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.188
If anyone ever finds out
about this...

01:05.691 --> 01:08.240
( scoffs ) Yeah, right.
I've come this far.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.530
Who could possibly
catch me now?

01:19.913 --> 01:21.836
( Beeping )

01:24.251 --> 01:26.345
<i>AGENT 1: See there,
there it is again.</i>

01:26.545 --> 01:27.842
<i>AGENT 2: We haven't
seen readings like this</i>

01:28.005 --> 01:29.427
<i>for 30 years.</i>

01:29.631 --> 01:31.178
<i>Is it coming
from deep space?</i>

01:31.383 --> 01:32.350
<i>An enemy
weapons site?</i>

01:34.136 --> 01:36.605
<i>Just as I suspected.</i>

01:36.763 --> 01:39.562
<i>Gentlemen, we're going
to Gravity Falls.</i>

02:22.768 --> 02:23.860
( alarm buzzing )

02:25.479 --> 02:26.947
on, right.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.615
Show time.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.567
<i>STAN: Welcome
to the grand re-opening</i>

02:30.776 --> 02:31.777
<i>of the Mystery Shack!</i>

02:31.985 --> 02:32.781
( cheers and applause )

02:32.986 --> 02:34.283
Mystery Shack!

02:34.488 --> 02:35.660
We're here
to celebrate the defeat

02:35.864 --> 02:36.865
of that skunk little Gideon.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.371
CROWD: Boo!

02:38.575 --> 02:40.828
Please, please,
boo harder.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.538
CROWD: Boo!

02:42.746 --> 02:44.293
But I didn't catch
that pork chop all alone.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.842
These two scams deserve
some of the glory.

02:47.000 --> 02:47.842
Oh!

02:48.001 --> 02:48.923
Okay, okay-

02:49.127 --> 02:50.094
Most of the glory.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.389
Smile for the camera.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.182
Your camera's
a cinder block, Toby.

02:54.383 --> 02:57.057
I just want to be
a part of things.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.807
Smile for a real camera.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.810
Everyone say
"something stupid."

03:01.014 --> 03:03.187
TOGETHER: Something stupid!

03:03.392 --> 03:04.814
And don't forget to come
to the after party

03:05.018 --> 03:06.486
tonight at 8:00.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.655
We're doing
a karaoke bonanza, people.

03:08.855 --> 03:09.947
Lights! Music!

03:10.148 --> 03:11.821
Enchantment!
Phoo!

03:12.025 --> 03:13.527
And an amazing

03:13.735 --> 03:14.827
karaoke performance
by our family band,

03:15.028 --> 03:16.405
Love Patrol Alpha.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.956
Oh, I don't know
about that.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.499
I would never
agree to that ever.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.952
Too late, I wrote your names
on the list.

03:21.159 --> 03:21.955
It's happening.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.086
( Blows horn )

03:23.286 --> 03:24.754
Buy your ticket, people.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.002
You know you don't have
anything else

03:26.164 --> 03:27.290
going on in your lives.

03:27.499 --> 03:28.967
I'm talking to you,
pizza guy.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.885
Don't lame out on me.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.717
Ha!
The town loves us.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.973
We finally got that Gideon
smell out of the carpet.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.267
Everything
is finally going my way.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.515
Hey, Grunkle Stan,
now that we have a moment,

03:39.720 --> 03:41.848
I've been meaning to ask you
for my journal back.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.057
What? Journal?

03:44.266 --> 03:46.439
Oh, you mean
this old thing?

03:46.601 --> 03:48.899
It was so boring
I couldn't even finish it.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.200
( Squeals )

03:53.400 --> 03:54.777
You didn't see nothing.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.487
Wait, you're just gonna
give it to me?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.242
Just like that?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.907
What else do you want?
A kiss on the cheek?

04:00.115 --> 04:01.537
I-- I got to go.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.119
Whoa!

04:03.285 --> 04:04.161
I wouldn't mind
a kiss on the cheek.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.370
Not gonna happen.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.882
Mabel,
we've got to talk.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.508
Almost losing my journal
made me realize

04:14.713 --> 04:16.135
that I'm halfway
through the summer

04:16.339 --> 04:17.886
and still no closer
to figuring out

04:18.091 --> 04:19.593
the big mysteries
of Gravity Falls.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.057
Gideon almost
destroyed the town

04:21.261 --> 04:22.308
to get his hands
on this journal.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.105
But why?
Who wrote it?

04:24.306 --> 04:25.774
Where are
all the other journals?

04:25.974 --> 04:27.226
What was Bill talking about
when he said

04:27.434 --> 04:29.186
everything was
going to change?

04:29.394 --> 04:31.897
There's something huge
going on right under our noses.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.357
And it's time
we stop goofing around

04:33.523 --> 04:35.400
and get to the bottom of it.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.486
Bro, you've looked at that
thing, like, a bazillion times.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.367
There's nothing
left to discover.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.244
Half the pages are blank,
remember?

04:42.866 --> 04:44.493
I just feel like
I'm one puzzle piece away

04:44.701 --> 04:46.078
from figuring out everything.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.496
Don't worry, Dipper.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.957
Lord Mystery Ham
is on the case.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.125
"I play by me own rules!
What? What?"

04:52.334 --> 04:54.382
I don't know
why I tell you things.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.508
Do you hear that?

05:00.717 --> 05:02.515
Hey, Mr. Pines,
what's that code word

05:02.719 --> 05:04.266
I'm supposed to yell
when I see a government vehicle?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.314
Wait, what?
Government vehicle?

05:11.520 --> 05:14.194
The Mystery Shack is now closed.
Everybody out!

05:14.397 --> 05:15.774
I will not hesitate
to use the hose

05:15.982 --> 05:17.325
on the elderly.

05:17.484 --> 05:17.950
Uncle Stan,
what's happening?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.870
Yeah, you never
shut down the gift shop.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.072
( Doorbell ringing )

05:22.239 --> 05:23.741
( knocking on door )

05:23.949 --> 05:25.622
Welcome to the Mystery Shack,
gentlemen.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.873
What can I get you?
Key chains?

05:27.077 --> 05:28.579
Snow globes?

05:28.787 --> 05:31.381
These rare
photos of American Presidents?

05:31.581 --> 05:32.958
My name is Agent Powers.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.167
This is Agent Trigger.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.878
We're here to investigate

05:36.044 --> 05:37.842
reports of mysterious activity
in this town.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.548
Activity.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.975
Mysterious activity
in the Mystery Shack?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.097
You got to be joking.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.848
I assure you I am not.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.805
I was born with a rare disorder
that makes me

05:47.013 --> 05:49.141
physically incapable
of experiencing humor.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.976
( Nervous laughter )

05:51.184 --> 05:52.436
I don't understand
that sound

05:52.602 --> 05:53.728
you're making
with your mouth.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.189
Now if you'll excuse us,

05:55.397 --> 05:56.819
we're conducting
an investigation.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.275
Investigation.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.818
Wait, wait.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.278
Did you guys say
you're investigating

06:01.444 --> 06:02.661
the mysteries of this town?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.957
That information
is classified.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.157
But, yes.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.997
Look, between you and me,

06:08.159 --> 06:10.082
I believe there is a conspiracy
of paranormal origin

06:10.287 --> 06:11.880
all connected
to this town.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.132
We're just one small lead away
from blowing

06:14.332 --> 06:16.300
the lid off this
entire mystery.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.969
Are you kidding me?

06:18.169 --> 06:19.637
I'm investigating
the exact same thing.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.090
I found
this journal in the woods

06:21.298 --> 06:23.016
which has almost
all the answers.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.514
If we work together,
we could crack the case.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.056
If you have
evidence of these claims,

06:29.264 --> 06:31.358
we should talk.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.027
We can talk right now.
Please, please, come in.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.774
I have so much
to show you.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.572
I'm sorry, agents.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.070
Kid has an overactive
imagination and, like,

06:40.275 --> 06:41.322
a sweating problem.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.827
MABEL: ( laughs ) Zing!

06:43.028 --> 06:44.325
Paranormal town stuff,

06:44.529 --> 06:45.655
it's just
part of gift shop lore.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.707
Sells more tickets, you know.

06:47.908 --> 06:48.875
Pop-porO-PO-PQ-.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.077
Swag.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.917
We have other spots
to investigate.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.422
We'll be on our way.

06:54.623 --> 06:55.715
I'm confiscating
this for evidence.

06:55.916 --> 06:56.838
POWERS:
Smart move.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.343
Wait!
No, wait!

06:58.543 --> 06:59.385
We have so much
to talk about.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.304
Hold it, kiddo.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.051
Trust me, the last thing
you want around here

07:03.256 --> 07:04.553
in a party is cops.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.556
I'm confiscating
that card.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.387
And how's about
you go be a normal kid?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.313
Flirt with a girl,
or steal a pie off a windowsill.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.060
But, Grunkle Stan,
you don't understand.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.313
And don't go talking
to those agents.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.109
( Groans ) That could have
been my big break.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.190
Bro, maybe Grunkle Stan
is right.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.945
We're throwing
a party tonight.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.823
Can't you go one night
without searching

07:24.027 --> 07:26.121
for aliens or raising
the dead or whatever?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.031
I'm not gonna
raise the dead.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.832
I just need a chance to show
those agents my book.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.626
Trust me, Dipper.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.624
The only book you'll need
tonight is right here.

07:33.828 --> 07:34.920
BED]

07:36.498 --> 07:39.001
I say "kara," you say "oke."
Kara...

07:40.251 --> 07:42.674
Kara...
Kara...

07:44.005 --> 07:45.006
I could do this all day.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.681
Agh!

07:49.886 --> 07:50.637
Well, the confetti
cannon works.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.563
( Qasps )

07:52.722 --> 07:54.941
And the karaoke machine
has all the best songs.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.109
"We built this township
on rock and roll."

07:57.310 --> 07:59.278
"Danger lane
to highway town."

07:59.479 --> 08:02.232
"Taking over midnight"
by AmperSandra.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.572
Listen, kid, you do not want
to hear this voice singing.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.449
Trust me.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.372
Grunkle Stan, karaoke
isn't about sounding good.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.246
It's about
sounding terrible, together.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.123
( Iaughil19 )

08:14.327 --> 08:16.500
Check it out! These black lights
make my teeth look scary.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.793
It's like a crime scene
in my mouth.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.085
Come on, you'll love it.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.795
( Sighs )
It's not fair.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.805
Finally I meet someone
who can help me

08:26.006 --> 08:28.555
solve the mysteries of this town
and Stan confiscates their card.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.351
Dude, I probably
shouldn't be telling you this,

08:30.552 --> 08:32.145
but I'm pretty sure
Stan hides like

08:32.345 --> 08:34.143
everything in his room.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.145
If I go into Stan's room,
I could get in so much trouble.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.602
Yeah, you're probably right.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.607
That's what
makes it fun, dummy.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.733
Man, I can't wait to smash
these Stanatas.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.488
Smash!

08:46.693 --> 08:48.366
Grenda
has entered the party!

08:48.570 --> 08:50.243
Stan's brains
look delicious.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.619
Girls!

08:53.199 --> 08:54.325
0h, my gosh!
0h, my gush, Mabel!

08:54.534 --> 08:56.127
Is that a boom box sweater?

08:56.327 --> 08:57.453
See for yourself.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.754
Poke!
( music playing )

08:58.955 --> 09:02.380
Yeah, yeah!
Work it! Ah!

09:04.586 --> 09:06.008
Aw!

09:06.212 --> 09:07.805
I thought this was
gonna be a rave.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.179
Thompson, take off your shirt
and make it a rave.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.387
I'll do anything
for your approval.

09:13.595 --> 09:14.892
Oh, come on.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.518
I promise I won't
send it to anyone.

09:18.141 --> 09:21.441
Who's got one good eye
and one good pie?

09:21.603 --> 09:23.025
These kegs
are full of meat.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.526
( QiQQIes )

09:24.731 --> 09:27.109
Tambry sends me
the craziest text.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.694
The whole town is showing up

09:28.902 --> 09:30.825
and no sign
of those pesky agents.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.282
Wendy, Dipper, how are those
posters coming along?

09:35.784 --> 09:36.956
Hmm.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.631
Ifilkeep
an eye out for Stan.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.299
You go rustle through
his weird old man biz.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.173
( Creaking )

09:48.379 --> 09:51.178
All right, Grunkle Stan,
where did you hide that card?

09:51.382 --> 09:52.224
Nothing.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.678
Nothing.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.730
EH1

09:57.931 --> 09:59.274
Pretending
I never saw that.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.605
Wait a minute.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.359
Yes!

10:05.897 --> 10:07.240
I sot it!

10:08.274 --> 10:09.116

10:09.317 --> 10:10.364

10:10.568 --> 10:11.490
<i>POWERS: Agent Powers.</i>

10:11.694 --> 10:13.321
Hi, this is Dipper.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.656
The kid from the Mystery Shack,
the one with the,

10:14.864 --> 10:16.616
um, sweating problem.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.668
I have that journal
I wanted to show you.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.916
<i>And you're certain this journal
will help our case?</i>

10:21.079 --> 10:22.547
I'm 100% positive.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.966
<i>Very well.
We're on our way.</i>

10:25.166 --> 10:26.213
( Qasps )

10:26.417 --> 10:27.213
Sorry, Dipper.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.715
I got distracted.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.638
Kid, why did you call
those agents?

10:30.839 --> 10:32.261
I've told you once,
I've told you 100 times,

10:32.465 --> 10:34.934
there's nothing
supernatural going on

10:35.135 --> 10:35.931
in Gravity Falls.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.513
Yes, there is.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.896
After everything
that's happened,

10:39.097 --> 10:40.644
you have to know
that by now.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.817
All I know
is that your dumb obsession

10:43.017 --> 10:45.315
is gonna get us all in trouble
one of these days.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.397
Now go enjoy
the rest of the party,

10:47.605 --> 10:49.858
'cause when it's over,
you're grounded.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.163
Hmm.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.332
( Party music playing )
Hey, boys, looking good!

11:05.540 --> 11:06.962
<i>Gurney,
you dean up nice.</i>

11:07.167 --> 11:09.465
Mr. Poolcheck,
move those crazy legs.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.218
You-- You weird pool man.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.015
What's the problem,
officers?

11:14.215 --> 11:17.640
Did you catch my face
going 90 smiles per hour?

11:17.802 --> 11:20.351
We've got complaints about
the loudest party in town.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.182
Three words.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.312
We want in.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.528
Welcome to your dreams.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.151
( Whistles blowing )

11:33.484 --> 11:35.202
Guys,
I'm so glad to see you.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.863
Working together,
we can crack

11:37.071 --> 11:39.119
all the big questions
of Gravity Falls.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.535
Trust me, this book is the lead
you've been looking for.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.461
I'm thinking
full-scale investigation.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.004
Forensics, researchers.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.335
Do you guys have
a helicopter?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.540
( Chuckles )

11:47.749 --> 11:49.592
I'm sorry, "helicopters."

11:50.001 --> 11:52.345
Kid, I'd love to believe you,
but this just looks like

11:52.545 --> 11:54.218
more junk
from your uncle's gift shop.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.174
I lTIea
n II

11:56.382 --> 11:58.635
I can't be the only one
that thinks that it's not funny.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.769
I can confirm.
Not funny.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.643
No, it's real, I swear.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.349
You should
"send it to the lab."

12:04.557 --> 12:06.355
Am I saying that right?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.402
Your uncle was right about
that overactive imagination.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.438
We've got paperwork
to do, kid.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.115
Boring paperwork.
Wait!

12:12.315 --> 12:13.658
This book is real.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.360
Gnomes, cursed objects,
spells!

12:15.568 --> 12:16.740
Listen!
Uh...

12:16.945 --> 12:18.367
Uh...
Corpus Levitas!

12:18.571 --> 12:21.825

12:25.286 --> 12:26.128
Huh?

12:26.329 --> 12:27.296
Huh?

12:34.295 --> 12:35.888
( Growling )

12:36.089 --> 12:39.434
Ha, a zombie!
A real actual zombie, see.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.307
Spooky journal,
100% real.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.728
Now can we work together?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.272
Mother of all that is holy.

12:44.472 --> 12:45.439
What do we do?

12:45.640 --> 12:47.267
It's just one zombie.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.102
Trust me, I see stuff like this
all the time.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.106

12:52.438 --> 12:53.815

12:54.023 --> 12:55.115
Good thing
it was just that one.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.074
Oh! my gosh.
YOU guys can help, right?

13:03.241 --> 13:05.164
Kid, we've been chasing
the paranormal for years,

13:05.368 --> 13:07.496
but we've never seen
anything like this before.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.626
Get down!

13:08.830 --> 13:09.922
( Screaming )

13:11.249 --> 13:13.752
( screaming )

13:13.960 --> 13:15.962
Oh, my gosh.
What have I done?

13:18.089 --> 13:20.763
♪ What up, fools?
It's Blubs and Durls ♪

13:20.925 --> 13:23.895
♪ Making all that money
and getting them girls ♪

13:24.095 --> 13:25.642
Oh!

13:25.847 --> 13:28.771
What do you say, guys?
Is this party legendary?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.148
When I say Mabel,
you say Pines.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.194
( Rumbling )

13:32.395 --> 13:33.362
Mabel!

13:33.521 --> 13:34.738
( Screams )
Mabel!

13:34.939 --> 13:36.441
We're all gonna die!

13:36.649 --> 13:37.445
Why does that never work?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.243
Whoa, whoa.

13:39.402 --> 13:40.995
I think it's an earthquake.
( blows horn )

13:41.195 --> 13:43.163
Hey, everybody, we got
to get out of here!

We're all doomed.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.456
Wait! No!
Don't leave!

13:51.664 --> 13:54.133
You haven't even done
our family karaoke song yet.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.301

13:57.754 --> 13:59.506
( panting )

13:59.714 --> 14:01.011
Dipper,
what's the one thing

14:01.215 --> 14:02.717
I asked you
not to do tonight?

14:02.925 --> 14:04.302
Raise the dead.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.511
And what did you do?

14:05.720 --> 14:06.687
Raise the dead.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.982
( Growling )

14:09.182 --> 14:11.435
Get back, dudes.
This is about to get intense.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.318
( Screaming )

14:16.481 --> 14:17.403
Sorry, one second.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.151
You've got to admit
this is pretty cool.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.621
( Growling )

14:24.822 --> 14:26.495
Zombies!

14:26.699 --> 14:28.952
Don't panic. Maybe they're just
a really ugly flash mob.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.084
Dudes, stay calm.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.040
I've been
training for this moment

14:34.248 --> 14:35.716
my whole life.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.635
With all the horror movies
I've seen,

14:37.835 --> 14:38.802
I know literally everything
there is to know about

14:38.961 --> 14:39.928
how to avoid zombies.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.684
Second thought,
gonna flip the script.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.265
Can I eat your brains?

14:47.470 --> 14:48.813
Yay or nay?

14:49.013 --> 14:50.560
Seeing some yay faces
over here.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.724
( Shrieking )

14:57.647 --> 14:58.614
Quick, the golf cart.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.906
Oh, come on.

15:03.111 --> 15:03.987
( Chuckles )
That's a bummer.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.287
Good news for me though.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.956
Soos!

15:07.156 --> 15:09.454
Sorry, dude, I just really
want those brains.

15:09.659 --> 15:10.581
Stay back!

15:17.500 --> 15:19.127
Give it up, dudes.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.962
Your fighting only makes us
look more rad.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.138
What do we do?
Where's Grunkle Stan?

15:23.339 --> 15:24.841
How's he supposed to help?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.426
He doesn't even believe
in the supernatural.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.056
Those agents
could ruin everything.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.561
Darn kid!

15:32.723 --> 15:34.270
He has no idea
what he's messing with.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.187
He's stubborn.
That's his problem.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.946
Sort of like me, I suppose.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.910
I got too much
on my mind to worry about

15:44.110 --> 15:45.327
those kids right now.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.654
All right, let's see.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.495
( Panting )

15:50.992 --> 15:52.710
( growling )

15:52.910 --> 15:54.082
Take that, sucker!

15:58.749 --> 16:00.672
This thing's a surprisingly
good weapon.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.096
We need to board up
all the windows.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.392
Okay,
maybe that will hold them.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.440
Oh!
Hi, dudes.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.601
By the way, I taught the zombies
how to get to the fuse box.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.231
Among these dudes
I'm like a genius.

16:19.770 --> 16:20.862
Get those brains, dog.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.690
( Growling )

16:24.650 --> 16:26.243
Dipper, isn't there something
in the journal

16:26.402 --> 16:27.949
about defeating zombies?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.282
No! There's nothing in here
about weaknesses.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.163
( Sighs )
This can't be happening.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.623
I wanted answers so bad
I put everyone in danger.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.295
Now we're toast.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.339
It's all my fault
and no one can save us.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.756
( Growling )

16:39.957 --> 16:41.254
No!
Mabel, I'm sorry!

who harasses my family is me.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.366
And that!

Beat it, no-eyes.

Oh! Ow!

17:39.392 --> 17:40.609
Everything hurts.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.403
Grunkle Stan,
that was amazing!

17:42.562 --> 17:43.484
Are you all right?

17:43.688 --> 17:45.486
( Nervous chuckle )

17:45.690 --> 17:48.534
Well, at least, you can't deny
magic exists anymore, right?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.156
Kid, I've always known.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.037
Wait.
What are you talking about?

17:52.238 --> 17:53.911
I'm not an idiot, Dipper.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.243
Of course, this town is weird
and the one thing

17:56.450 --> 17:58.748
I know about that weirdness
is that it's dangerous.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.962
I've been lying about it to try
to keep you away from it,

18:04.125 --> 18:05.843
to try to protect you from it.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.967
It looks like I didn't lie
well enough.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.300
( Growling )

18:14.760 --> 18:16.182
What do we do?
What do we do?

18:16.387 --> 18:17.730
Normally,
the journal would help us,

18:17.930 --> 18:18.852
but there's nothing
in there about

18:19.056 --> 18:19.852
defeating zombies.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.058
It's hopeless.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.735
Wait, wait, wait, the text!

18:22.935 --> 18:24.528
It's glowing
in the black light.

18:24.729 --> 18:25.696
What?

18:27.898 --> 18:30.071
All this time I thought
I knew all the journal secrets.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.324
But they're written
in some kind of invisible ink.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.529
Invisible ink?

18:33.738 --> 18:34.830
This is it.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.408

Previously thought
to be invincible,

How can we create that?

high pitched scream.

everything.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.560
Dipper, are you kidding me?

I got to sing karaoke
with my two favorite

people in the world.

No party could ever top that.

Kids, listen,
this town is crazy.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.904
So you need
to be careful.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.401
I don't know
what I'd do with myself

21:13.564 --> 21:14.986
if you got hurt
on my watch.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.285
I'll let you hold
onto that spooky journal

21:17.443 --> 21:19.195
as long as you promise me
you'll only use it

21:19.361 --> 21:22.240
for self-defense
and not go looking for trouble.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.291
Okay,
as long as you promise me

21:24.492 --> 21:26.540
that you don't have
any other bombshell secrets

21:26.744 --> 21:28.291
about this town.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.338
Promise.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.664
Promise.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.668
Man, we have got
a lot of zombie damage

21:33.876 --> 21:34.923
to clean up.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.128
Where's my handyman anyway?

21:36.337 --> 21:38.931
SOOS: Brains! Brains!

21:39.131 --> 21:40.053
Holy Moses!

21:40.257 --> 21:41.930
Wait!

21:42.134 --> 21:43.932
There's a page in here about
curing zombification.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.934
It's gonna
take a lot of formaldehyde.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.515
Ooh, and cinnamon.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.024
Come on, Soos,
let's fix you up.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.319
Brains! Brains!

21:51.519 --> 21:52.520
Soos, cut it out!

21:52.728 --> 21:53.775
( Chuckles ) Sorry, dude.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.447
I can't believe it.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.740
All this time
the author's secrets

21:56.941 --> 21:58.443
were hiding in plain sight.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.824
A whole new chapter
of mysteries to explore.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.500
That was insane.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.122
I've never seen
anything like it.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.453
Who do we report to?

22:12.289 --> 22:14.166
This is bigger than
we imagined.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.048
We need to bring in
the big guns.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.504
But they'll never
believe us.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.179
Then we'll make them
believe us.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.974
This is the town
we've been searching for.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.767
Ba-- Ba-- Bam.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.436
Another zombie!

22:25.636 --> 22:26.808
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!

22:28.472 --> 22:29.689
TOGETHER: Oh, okay,
it's just--

22:29.890 --> 22:31.483
Who is that guy?
A very ugly man.
