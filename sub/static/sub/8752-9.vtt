WEBVTT

00:10.600 --> 00:14.009
There's a lot of anger,
towards the living.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.925
I was thrown to this doorway.

00:16.926 --> 00:18.627
It was kind of brutal.

00:18.628 --> 00:20.440
Aw, geez.

00:20.441 --> 00:22.871
They're banging on the walls...

00:22.872 --> 00:24.894
Wanting to leave.

00:24.895 --> 00:27.659
He went totally
ballistic and killed her.

00:27.660 --> 00:30.780
She's being assaulted.

00:31.439 --> 00:35.399
I'm not alone inside of my body.

00:35.670 --> 00:37.539
It's really bad in here.

00:37.540 --> 00:40.345
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.346 --> 00:42.622
Something is not right.

00:42.623 --> 00:43.726
I see dead people.

00:43.727 --> 00:45.928
This person might have
been a serial killer.

00:45.929 --> 00:47.897
I speak to dead people.

00:47.898 --> 00:49.256
You get those chills.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.799
And they speak to me.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.398
He is darkness. He is evil.

00:53.399 --> 00:56.302
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:56.303 --> 00:57.988
I think she broke her neck.

00:57.989 --> 00:59.505
I rely on my partner.

00:59.506 --> 01:03.588
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:03.589 --> 01:05.361
You telling me the truth?

01:05.361 --> 01:08.408
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:08.409 --> 01:10.014
I think the Devil is down here.

01:10.015 --> 01:11.388
It's my job to reveal them.

01:11.389 --> 01:13.072
Who the hell would do this?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.977
But Steve and I never speak...

01:14.978 --> 01:17.093
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:17.094 --> 01:18.559
Until the very end.

01:18.560 --> 01:19.826
Who is he looking to kill?

01:19.827 --> 01:21.792
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:21.793 --> 01:23.882
You need to get out of here right now.

01:23.883 --> 01:25.233
Or time to get out.

01:25.234 --> 01:28.834
It was like endless darkness.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074

01:47.024 --> 01:49.593
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

01:49.594 --> 01:51.719
I dig into the history of the location,

01:51.720 --> 01:55.789
and interview witnesses about
their paranormal experiences.

01:55.790 --> 01:58.203
While Amy deals directly with the dead.

01:58.204 --> 02:00.373
I'm in the small town
of Radford, Virginia.

02:00.374 --> 02:02.308
It's about an hour outside of Roanoke.

02:02.309 --> 02:05.444
Amy and I were called in by
this woman named Marcelle.

02:05.445 --> 02:08.259
She saved a huge historical
building from the wrecking ball.

02:08.261 --> 02:12.217
But she says ever since, her life's
been nothing but a living hell.

02:12.218 --> 02:16.658
She says Amy and I are her last chance.

02:22.027 --> 02:26.258
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:26.259 --> 02:28.072
Even though this
building seems abandoned,

02:28.073 --> 02:33.973
I still have to cover or remove anything
that could influence her findings.

02:34.837 --> 02:40.737
When I'm done, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

02:53.555 --> 02:56.557
There are a lot of people here...

02:56.558 --> 02:59.318
Layers of people.

02:59.757 --> 03:01.561
There's about four women.

03:01.562 --> 03:05.359
They don't want to be here
anymore, they want to leave, and...

03:05.360 --> 03:07.760
They can't.

03:12.502 --> 03:16.882
So, they're all up there, these people.

03:18.207 --> 03:20.209
It's very physical.

03:20.210 --> 03:22.970
I can't breathe.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.386
Marcelle, you sounded really upset on
the phone about what's happening here...

03:35.387 --> 03:36.622
What's going on?

03:36.623 --> 03:39.884
We've had people who have seen
apparitions in the building.

03:39.885 --> 03:44.505
We have volunteers who have
been picked up and tossed...

03:44.506 --> 03:45.885
Hair pulled.

03:45.886 --> 03:50.010
Visitors come in that have
left with scratch marks on them.

03:50.011 --> 03:53.626
And seems that the activity
has become more and more.

03:53.627 --> 03:56.141
So, with a list like that of
things that are happening here,

03:56.142 --> 03:57.161
why would you stay here?

03:57.162 --> 04:00.246
For the love of the building.
There's just something about it.

04:00.247 --> 04:03.356
Well, Marcelle, I've got to say, this
is probably one of the biggest buildings

04:03.357 --> 04:05.195
we've ever investigated, how big is it?

04:05.196 --> 04:07.017
It's over 68,000 square feet.

04:07.018 --> 04:08.418
Wow. Okay.

04:08.419 --> 04:10.853
What's the story as far as
history goes? What do you know?

04:10.854 --> 04:14.847
In the early 1900s,
it became a Sanatorium,

04:14.848 --> 04:18.593
and it stayed a
Sanatorium until the 1980s.

04:18.594 --> 04:21.695
We'll, you know, looking around,
this is definitely a work in progress.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.396
What are your plans for it?

04:23.397 --> 04:28.000
We would love to restore the
building and turn it into a museum...

04:28.001 --> 04:30.334
With history about the Sanatorium.

04:30.335 --> 04:32.904
And we'd also like to
put a research library in.

04:32.905 --> 04:36.174
Do you do anything with it now? Is it just,
basically, you're in the repair stage?

04:36.175 --> 04:39.578
In order to pay for the repairs,
we've had some conferences here.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.713
We've had a wedding here recently.

04:41.714 --> 04:43.556
We're doing some parties.

04:43.557 --> 04:47.019
Okay. What are you hoping we can
do for you with this investigation?

04:47.020 --> 04:50.022
I'm hoping you can help
us to find a solution.

04:50.023 --> 04:54.004
It's not only a passion in my
heart, we're run by volunteers,

04:54.005 --> 04:59.593
and we don't want the people
coming in to be harmed or injured.

04:59.594 --> 05:01.514
Okay.

05:11.110 --> 05:14.881
Living people are not
supposed to be here.

05:14.882 --> 05:20.782
Dead people push themselves up against
the walls to get out of their way.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.722
They don't want to be bothered.

05:22.723 --> 05:26.263
They don't like the living.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.924
They're just pissed off and exhausted.

05:33.925 --> 05:37.645
And they feel so, like, tired.

05:45.370 --> 05:47.239
What made you bring me down here?

05:47.240 --> 05:51.208
This is one of the rooms where I
had one of my first experiences.

05:51.209 --> 05:53.510
One of our volunteers had...

05:53.511 --> 05:56.947
It was like... something
jumped into her.

05:56.948 --> 05:59.416
Okay, so, take me through what happened.

05:59.417 --> 06:01.656
She became, like, in a trance.

06:01.657 --> 06:05.340
When she was talking, her words
were all jumbled and garbled,

06:05.341 --> 06:07.491
and just was not making sense at all.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.159
Okay, so, how did you get her out of it?

06:09.160 --> 06:13.530
We pulled out Bible scriptures
and read Bible to her.

06:13.531 --> 06:16.934
Okay, now, did she come
out of it eventually?

06:16.935 --> 06:19.818
Yes. It took a little
over an hour, but she did.

06:19.819 --> 06:21.639
- Do you know this girl personally?
- I do.

06:21.640 --> 06:25.409
Okay, is she on any medication
that would make her demeanor change?

06:25.410 --> 06:27.144
- Nothing like that?
- No, not at all.

06:27.145 --> 06:28.512
Anything else down here?

06:28.513 --> 06:30.114
A woman screamed at me.

06:30.115 --> 06:32.015
Kind of like I'd startled her.

06:32.016 --> 06:34.351
You sure it wasn't somebody
playing games in here?

06:34.352 --> 06:35.200
There's no way.

06:35.201 --> 06:37.525
And you weren't open for any
kind of business or anything?

06:37.526 --> 06:40.286
No, we were not.

06:43.694 --> 06:47.264
There's, like, a woman
running up to me, screaming.

06:47.265 --> 06:49.199
She's freaking out.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.260
She just says that...

06:52.986 --> 06:54.938
It's time to go.

06:54.939 --> 06:56.340
And she's panicked.

06:56.341 --> 06:58.709
A living person would feel this...

06:58.710 --> 07:01.530
This, like, panic.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.019
You feel like...

07:04.020 --> 07:08.334
Something really bad is going to happen.

07:08.335 --> 07:12.235
You feel like you need to leave.

07:19.691 --> 07:21.865
I didn't expect to see
a bowling alley in here.

07:21.866 --> 07:25.168
Was this used by the patients or was
this for the people that worked here?

07:25.169 --> 07:28.938
Primarily, it was used as reward
for good behavior from the patients.

07:28.939 --> 07:30.751
They were allowed to
come down here and bowl.

07:30.752 --> 07:32.617
All right. So, why'd
you bring me down here?

07:32.618 --> 07:37.133
Well, I had my first
paranormal experience in here.

07:37.134 --> 07:38.615
Okay, what happened?

07:38.616 --> 07:41.825
I had this large, white mist
come through the door behind you,

07:41.826 --> 07:44.393
and go down the bowling alley...

07:44.394 --> 07:46.689
And then make a hard right
turn and go through the wall.

07:46.690 --> 07:48.725
What was odd... is the
temperature dropped.

07:48.726 --> 07:50.493
Okay, anything else?

07:50.494 --> 07:54.364
My most horrifying experience
happened just next to the file room.

07:54.365 --> 07:59.335
I got very dizzy, short of breath,
went to the emergency medical area.

07:59.336 --> 08:01.236
Come to find out, it was my pacemaker.

08:01.237 --> 08:04.923
It went haywire and was
beating at 143 beats a minute.

08:04.924 --> 08:05.814
Wow.

08:05.815 --> 08:08.578
And my blood pressure was 164 over 112.

08:08.579 --> 08:12.631
Now, Don, did the doctors ever come up
with an explanation as to what happened?

08:12.632 --> 08:14.680
No, they couldn't
even tell me one thing.

08:14.681 --> 08:19.661
There was nothing to
show what happened at all.

08:23.793 --> 08:26.526
Do you think people could live here?

08:26.527 --> 08:27.838
No.

08:27.839 --> 08:30.959
I wouldn't live here.

08:30.976 --> 08:33.514
- I don't think it's healthy.
- What would happen?

08:33.515 --> 08:37.475
I think that they would get sick.

08:38.174 --> 08:40.677
Just let the dead have it.

08:40.678 --> 08:44.808
I just don't think living
people should be here.

08:44.809 --> 08:48.589
It's probably not a good idea.

09:08.901 --> 09:11.036
So, Chuck, I was talking to Marcelle.

09:11.037 --> 09:13.405
- You're the head of Security here?
- Yes, Sir.

09:13.406 --> 09:15.407
You're probably law
enforcement, I assume?

09:15.408 --> 09:18.276
- I'm a retired deputy Sheriff.
- Okay.

09:18.277 --> 09:20.598
Have you ever had any
experiences yourself?

09:20.599 --> 09:23.615
Oh, yes, Sir, I had one right here.

09:23.616 --> 09:29.321
Standing on this lower step one
night, I felt myself levitate.

09:29.322 --> 09:34.293
It was like I just became
weightless and started coming up...

09:34.294 --> 09:36.485
And thrown...

09:36.486 --> 09:39.546
Over to this doorway.

09:39.695 --> 09:42.795
I could just feel like
something gripped me, okay?

09:42.796 --> 09:43.665
Okay.

09:43.666 --> 09:49.566
And had a hold of me to the point
that I had no control over my body.

09:50.253 --> 09:52.866
I've got to tell you, Chuck, if
you weren't prior law enforcement,

09:52.867 --> 09:55.482
that's not a story I would
probably believe right away.

09:55.483 --> 09:59.563
Well, I can totally understand that.

10:03.757 --> 10:07.650
They don't really want
us to be back here.

10:07.651 --> 10:10.891
Because this is their...

10:11.665 --> 10:14.005
Quiet area.

10:18.438 --> 10:20.200
I see...

10:20.201 --> 10:23.861
This man, and he's getting...

10:24.029 --> 10:26.439
A little frustrated.

10:26.440 --> 10:30.321
He's like their protector
for the dead here.

10:30.322 --> 10:36.222
And I think he's trying to set up, like,
a safe zone, or something, for them.

10:39.798 --> 10:43.292
He says he's going to make me sick.

10:43.293 --> 10:46.173
If I don't leave.

10:46.872 --> 10:49.874
Now, did anything else like
that ever happen to you?

10:49.875 --> 10:51.760
Yes, Sir.

10:51.761 --> 10:54.497
I left our gift shop area.

10:54.498 --> 10:58.634
There's some steps that will
bring you up to this first level.

10:58.635 --> 11:02.595
As I got about the sixth stair...

11:02.745 --> 11:05.154
I could see something standing there.

11:05.155 --> 11:07.857
I could see, like, the chest of it.

11:07.858 --> 11:08.782
Okay.

11:08.783 --> 11:12.870
You can see the muscles
just rippling through there.

11:12.871 --> 11:17.551
As soon as I saw that,
I was picked up...

11:17.572 --> 11:20.324
And not thrown straight back.

11:20.325 --> 11:24.705
But I was thrown over, like, the rails.

11:24.873 --> 11:28.098
Whatever it was had to be strong.

11:28.099 --> 11:31.139
Okay, did you get hurt?
I mean, that's a big fall.

11:31.140 --> 11:33.590
It just really shook me up.

11:33.591 --> 11:35.700
Felt like a bear got a hold of me.

11:35.701 --> 11:37.905
- Okay.
- Just that much strength.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.112
How do you wrap your head
around what's going on here?

11:40.113 --> 11:42.476
I couldn't even fathom
what this thing is.

11:42.477 --> 11:44.397
Okay.

11:47.013 --> 11:49.925
I don't even know what
that guy's capable of.

11:49.926 --> 11:54.417
But I think he's pretty
capable of quite a bit.

11:54.418 --> 11:56.289
Did you see him at all?

11:56.290 --> 11:58.218
He does project himself.

11:58.219 --> 12:01.099
He is white, tall.

12:01.470 --> 12:06.810
And feels very young. But
he's not, he's very old.

12:08.803 --> 12:11.432
And he's not happy.

12:11.433 --> 12:16.113
He doesn't not want
me to talk about him.

12:23.151 --> 12:25.353
So, Chuck, why'd you bring me down here?

12:25.354 --> 12:31.254
When I come in this room, I have
seen one face on several occasions.

12:31.442 --> 12:32.760
Describe it to me.

12:32.761 --> 12:36.231
- His face is very round.
- Okay.

12:36.232 --> 12:38.833
I'd say that he would
have been a big man.

12:38.834 --> 12:41.104
Okay, does it looks like he

12:41.105 --> 12:43.904
knows you're looking at him or
like he's looking at anybody else?

12:43.905 --> 12:46.844
Oh, he definitely knows
you're looking at him.

12:46.845 --> 12:48.429
Anything else happen?

12:48.430 --> 12:51.733
One lady during an investigation.

12:51.734 --> 12:54.869
She was hit between the breastbone.

12:54.870 --> 12:58.543
She was hit so hard
that it left a bruise,

12:58.544 --> 13:01.642
and they told us the bruise
was there for almost two weeks.

13:01.643 --> 13:05.220
Okay, so, when you say an investigation,
we talking about, like, a paranormal group?

13:05.221 --> 13:06.644
Paranormal group, Sir.

13:06.645 --> 13:09.282
Any other thing, physical, happen here?

13:09.283 --> 13:12.587
Women have been touched inappropriately.

13:12.588 --> 13:17.508
They find, usually, the woman
who has the weakest emotions.

13:17.509 --> 13:18.396
Okay.

13:18.397 --> 13:22.950
And they just start
there and just drain them.

13:22.951 --> 13:28.851
And for that reason, we don't allow
any women in this room by themselves.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.910
Whatever's in here has just...

13:31.911 --> 13:35.751
Got something out for the women.

13:36.815 --> 13:42.715
So, now I'm seeing there's this new
guy, who tells me to call him Uncle.

13:43.063 --> 13:44.983
He...

13:45.046 --> 13:46.892
Likes it down here.

13:46.893 --> 13:48.525
He's a big guy.

13:48.526 --> 13:50.270
He's pervy.

13:50.271 --> 13:53.755
He likes to touch women's hair.

13:53.756 --> 13:59.656
I suspect, like, it doesn't just stop
with the hair, you know what I mean?

14:02.899 --> 14:06.079
And there are people...

14:06.122 --> 14:08.582
Maybe four...

14:09.205 --> 14:12.445
That are banging inside.

14:12.565 --> 14:15.445
And they want out.

14:15.577 --> 14:19.859
This dude... the Uncle dude
trapped all their asses in there.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.783
It has something to do with money, like,

14:22.784 --> 14:26.821
if he keeps them in there,
he'll get more money.

14:26.822 --> 14:30.602
He's flooded this place with...

14:31.026 --> 14:33.606
Just nastiness.

14:50.654 --> 14:53.590
Marcelle told me that St.
Albans used to be a Sanatorium.

14:53.591 --> 14:56.960
Now, that seemed like a pretty good
place to start my investigation.

14:56.961 --> 14:59.526
So I reached out to a local
psychiatrist who tells me

14:59.527 --> 15:05.287
that a lot of sick people
lived and died on the property.

15:09.707 --> 15:11.669
So, the current owner
of the property I'm

15:11.670 --> 15:14.412
investigating told me that
it had been a Sanatorium.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.514
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.

15:16.515 --> 15:21.784
It actually started out in the early
1900s as St. Albans school for boys.

15:21.785 --> 15:22.612
Okay.

15:22.613 --> 15:28.513
That closed in 1911, and Dr. John
C. King, with his own funds...

15:28.700 --> 15:31.702
Bought the facility and opened
it up, then, as a Sanatorium,

15:31.703 --> 15:36.332
or a freestanding private
psychiatric hospital.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.801
What kind of patients
would have been there?

15:38.802 --> 15:43.419
Anyone from people that might
have just exhaustion from overwork,

15:43.420 --> 15:46.299
all the way through some of
our severe psychiatric illness

15:46.300 --> 15:50.500
such as Schizophrenia, manic psychosis.

15:55.786 --> 15:58.726
So many different...

15:59.282 --> 16:01.322
People.

16:01.840 --> 16:06.831
- What do you mean?
- I'm seeing, like, people dressed...

16:06.832 --> 16:08.611
In suits and [Bleep].

16:08.612 --> 16:10.195
Like, professional people.

16:10.196 --> 16:15.017
Some guy is saying something,
like, about emotional trauma.

16:15.018 --> 16:18.354
He's like, I suffered emotional trauma.

16:18.355 --> 16:21.295
He's very dramatic.

16:22.925 --> 16:26.595
Walking from room to room, I keep seeing
all of these different dead people.

16:26.596 --> 16:31.034
Some are depressed, some are angry,
and they're all trying to speak to me.

16:31.035 --> 16:34.738
There's so much commotion and movement.

16:34.739 --> 16:38.519
They're banging on the walls...

16:39.176 --> 16:44.516
Wanting to leave, wanting
to leave, wanting to leave.

16:48.850 --> 16:51.730
There's some, like, little
old lady, and she's like...

16:51.731 --> 16:55.719
Oh, you know, it's a processing plant.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.020
They process you.

16:58.021 --> 17:01.266
And then the guy says...

17:01.267 --> 17:06.426
Oh, don't talk to them,
they're [Bleep] lunatics.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.679
So, with these types of patients there,

17:09.680 --> 17:11.428
what kind of treatments
would they have had?

17:11.429 --> 17:14.426
It could have been anything
from cold, wet wraps, all the way

17:14.428 --> 17:16.941
to things more evocative and
potentially more powerful as well.

17:16.942 --> 17:20.853
Such as psychosurgery including
lobotomies, Insulin coma therapy,

17:20.854 --> 17:22.869
electroconvulsive therapy.

17:22.871 --> 17:25.290
Now, is that the same
as electroshock therapy?

17:25.291 --> 17:26.443
Yes.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.769
So many were done at St.
Albans during a stretch of time,

17:28.770 --> 17:33.017
they actually had one machine
that they called Mighty Mouse.

17:33.018 --> 17:35.547
And they would just wheel
it from room to room.

17:35.548 --> 17:40.466
It was kind of brutal to have done
because no general anesthesia was offered.

17:40.467 --> 17:43.544
And so you would be fully awake
when you were administered an

17:43.545 --> 17:48.623
electrical current that would
induce a fairly significant seizure.

17:48.624 --> 17:50.557
I mean, it had to be pretty painful.

17:50.558 --> 17:52.632
I actually have a film
I'd like to show you

17:52.633 --> 17:57.553
to give you an idea of
just how it was done.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.218
Oh, geez.

18:12.129 --> 18:15.009
My feet, my hands.

18:15.175 --> 18:18.143
It's like burning. I
feel like I'm burning.

18:18.144 --> 18:20.344
I'm, like, shaking.

18:20.345 --> 18:22.565
It hurts.

18:23.379 --> 18:24.891
There is a female.

18:24.892 --> 18:27.683
She's scared. Very,
very, very frightened.

18:27.684 --> 18:32.484
She's shaking. She
feels like she's burning.

18:33.487 --> 18:36.590
Now, Doctor, this place
is 68,000 square feet.

18:36.591 --> 18:39.556
So, how many patients
would have been in there?

18:39.557 --> 18:41.009
Thousands over the years.

18:41.010 --> 18:42.938
Now, a place that big,
with that many patients,

18:42.939 --> 18:45.065
I got to assume there had
to be a lot of deaths there.

18:45.066 --> 18:48.520
You know, I think so, too. I
was able to find 10, for sure.

18:48.521 --> 18:51.948
But I think that would be
a gross underrepresentation

18:51.949 --> 18:55.903
of the deaths that likely
would have happened.

18:55.904 --> 18:58.072
Now, did they have a Morgue there?

18:58.073 --> 18:59.340
- Yes.
- Really?

18:59.341 --> 19:02.106
So, Doctor, I got to assume there
had to be a lot more deaths there,

19:02.107 --> 19:03.966
because you don't build
a Morgue for 10 people.

19:03.967 --> 19:09.067
- That's right, you would not. Absolutely.
- Okay.

19:13.967 --> 19:17.372
I see a group of people
sleeping on the floor here.

19:17.373 --> 19:21.753
It's just, like, a big heap of people.

19:22.924 --> 19:24.759
They're kind of covered up.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.700
Like, it's a mess.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.231
Dr. Scheiderer told me that St.
Albans was an all-boys school.

19:47.232 --> 19:51.682
Now, it didn't sound like much to me until
I called a local historian to check it out.

19:51.683 --> 19:53.999
He told me that the story
of the school's founder

19:54.000 --> 19:58.140
will definitely help my investigation.

20:04.929 --> 20:08.433
The school was actually started
by Professor George Miles.

20:08.434 --> 20:12.509
He was an educator, a
well-connected businessman.

20:12.510 --> 20:16.183
And he was also a wealthy individual...
he had married into a wealthy family.

20:16.184 --> 20:19.037
Okay, so, what purpose
did he open it for?

20:19.038 --> 20:21.473
It was a preparatory school for boys.

20:21.474 --> 20:26.846
Here's actually an advertisement
from 1892 when he opened the school.

20:26.847 --> 20:30.788
The idea was to train these
young men to be good gentlemen,

20:30.789 --> 20:34.321
and also to prepare them for
a track to go to university.

20:34.322 --> 20:36.556
Okay, now, what kind of guy was he?

20:36.557 --> 20:38.258
That depends on who you ask.

20:38.259 --> 20:42.308
He had this reputation of being
respectable and dedicated to his work.

20:42.309 --> 20:45.900
But he was also scheming and abrasive.

20:45.901 --> 20:47.000
Really?

20:47.001 --> 20:50.805
Now, what happened to the school, because
I understand it became a Sanatorium?

20:50.806 --> 20:55.638
Yeah, his business interests took
him away from the school in 1902.

20:55.639 --> 20:59.449
- And it kind of floundered without him.
- Okay.

20:59.450 --> 21:01.953
And in 1904, they shut it down.

21:01.954 --> 21:04.685
All right. So, what
winds up happening to him?

21:04.686 --> 21:08.658
Professor Miles actually
met a pretty tragic end.

21:08.659 --> 21:12.139
Early in 1905, he admitted
himself into a hospital,

21:12.140 --> 21:14.996
and they found that he had liver cancer.

21:14.997 --> 21:18.305
And within two months, he passed away.

21:18.306 --> 21:22.446
- He was only 42 years old.
- Okay.

21:23.904 --> 21:27.575
I'm seeing the man who
calls himself Uncle.

21:27.576 --> 21:31.969
And he was in charge...
very, very, wealthy.

21:31.970 --> 21:34.986
And he was the start...

21:34.987 --> 21:37.147
Of this.

21:40.322 --> 21:44.642
And at first, there was good intention.

21:45.578 --> 21:48.698
And then it went bad.

21:49.431 --> 21:51.366
Can you describe him?

21:51.367 --> 21:54.709
He's probably in his 40s.

21:54.710 --> 21:58.054
He's bald and he's pale.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.455
He's dying.

22:00.476 --> 22:03.176
He feels guilty.

22:08.049 --> 22:11.711
Now that I know my client's property
used to be a prep school and a Sanatorium,

22:11.712 --> 22:14.187
I need to see if anything
else went down there.

22:14.188 --> 22:17.081
So I hit the books at the local library.

22:17.082 --> 22:22.802
Digging through old records, I discovered
the murder of a girl name Gina Hall.

22:22.803 --> 22:28.563
Turns out, her car was last
seen near Marcelle's property.

22:28.909 --> 22:31.992
So, I'm headed over to meet
with a local police Lieutenant.

22:31.993 --> 22:34.088
Who says that the
connection between that case

22:34.089 --> 22:38.709
and St. Albans runs
much deeper than that.

22:44.391 --> 22:47.914
Lieutenant, I came across an article
talking about a homicide that happened

22:47.915 --> 22:50.698
that has a connection to the
property I'm investigating.

22:50.699 --> 22:52.156
What can you tell me about it?

22:52.157 --> 22:57.557
On June 28, 1980, Gina
Renee Hall, age 18 years old.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.388
Wanted to go dancing
at a club in Blacksburg,

23:00.389 --> 23:04.044
and met a guy named
Stephen Epperly, age 28.

23:04.045 --> 23:06.396
And he ended up talking
her into going back to a

23:06.397 --> 23:09.750
lake house that his
friend was taking care of.

23:09.751 --> 23:13.170
Okay. What did the original
investigators theorize happened?

23:13.171 --> 23:19.071
That Epperly made some advances toward
her, and she rejected those advances.

23:29.721 --> 23:33.925
There was something
with a female in here.

23:33.926 --> 23:37.729
And there's, like, an older man.

23:37.730 --> 23:41.630
She's kind of being messed with.

23:42.034 --> 23:46.537
I mean, I think he was trying to
kiss her or something, and then...

23:46.538 --> 23:48.998
It went bad.

23:51.009 --> 23:55.447
We believe that he just went
totally ballistic and killed her.

23:55.448 --> 23:59.077
And put her body in the
trunk of her own car.

23:59.078 --> 24:01.615
Drove her somewhere,
disposed of the body,

24:01.616 --> 24:06.043
and parked the car just down from where
you're investigating with the trunk open.

24:06.044 --> 24:07.324
Wow.

24:07.325 --> 24:10.520
What do we know about this guy
himself? I mean, what's his background?

24:10.521 --> 24:16.421
Epperly was a charmer to the ladies
thought very highly of himself.

24:17.668 --> 24:20.248
He was known to have
a very violent temper.

24:20.249 --> 24:23.622
And was actually charged
previously, before this happened,

24:23.623 --> 24:25.779
with a couple rapes in the community.

24:25.780 --> 24:27.123
You're kidding.

24:27.124 --> 24:30.480
So, he had all the characteristics of
a guy that would do something like this.

24:30.481 --> 24:32.341
Yes.

24:34.385 --> 24:39.725
First it was, like, teasing,
then it wasn't teasing.

24:43.094 --> 24:46.196
He got... he got mad real quick.

24:46.197 --> 24:49.617
And he, like, punches her.

24:51.632 --> 24:54.212
She's being...

24:54.371 --> 24:57.191
Kind of assaulted.

25:00.910 --> 25:03.947
He get's life in prison,
first-degree murder.

25:03.948 --> 25:06.326
Now, what about the body?
Was it ever recovered?

25:06.327 --> 25:08.127
No.

25:09.306 --> 25:13.431
First case in Virginia that someone was
convicted without ever finding the body.

25:13.432 --> 25:16.219
Wow. Where do you
think the body might be?

25:16.220 --> 25:18.634
Some believe that it may be at the lake.

25:18.635 --> 25:24.334
And some people believe that she's buried
on the property you're investigating.

25:24.335 --> 25:27.884
The rumor was that he worked at
St. Albans for a little while.

25:27.885 --> 25:29.925
Really?

25:31.566 --> 25:33.944
There's, uh...

25:33.945 --> 25:36.075
Something really, really wrong.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.996
Um...

25:42.367 --> 25:46.327
I'm not alone inside of my body.

25:47.790 --> 25:51.320
As I'm seeing this brutal
attack, I feel a woman jump me.

25:51.321 --> 25:53.201
She's entered my body.

25:53.202 --> 25:54.943
Whoa.

25:54.944 --> 25:58.259
Mm. That does not feel good. [Bleep]!

25:58.260 --> 26:02.830
And she's not the only one here
who can do this to living people.

26:02.831 --> 26:06.034
Hm-mnh, no. Hm-mnh. Hm-mnh, no.

26:06.035 --> 26:10.839
For one of the few times in
my life, I can't finish a walk.

26:10.840 --> 26:16.631
This woman refuses to leave my
body, and I fear for my own safety.

26:16.632 --> 26:17.779
Are you okay?

26:17.780 --> 26:21.380
No. She won't [Bleep] leave.

26:48.212 --> 26:50.958
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

26:50.959 --> 26:55.383
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other, and our clients, for the first time.

26:55.384 --> 26:57.452
Amy, I'd like you to meet Marcelle.

26:57.453 --> 27:00.888
Few years back, she saved this
building from a wrecking ball.

27:00.889 --> 27:03.424
Her dream is actually to
turn this place into a museum.

27:03.425 --> 27:04.726
Hmm.

27:04.727 --> 27:07.106
The problem is the
activity here is so bad,

27:07.107 --> 27:10.398
she's afraid for any guests or
any volunteers that work here.

27:10.399 --> 27:13.067
Now, speaking of
volunteers, this is Chuck.

27:13.068 --> 27:17.305
He's retired Police Officer.
He runs the Security here.

27:17.306 --> 27:21.242
He's been through some stuff
I've never even heard before.

27:21.243 --> 27:23.449
Marcelle wants to know if
there's any way that she can

27:23.450 --> 27:26.894
safely turn this place into a museum.

27:26.895 --> 27:29.576
So, now that Amy
understands why we're here,

27:29.577 --> 27:33.253
I'm going to ask her to
tell us about her walk.

27:33.254 --> 27:35.112
I...

27:35.113 --> 27:38.378
Got here, and it was very confusing.

27:38.379 --> 27:44.259
And I got just layers and
layers and layers of dead people.

27:44.732 --> 27:49.271
I got that a lot of the
dead are extremely angry.

27:49.272 --> 27:55.172
Pissed off, and exhausted, and that a
lot of them do not care for the living.

27:55.643 --> 27:58.779
There was one location
that I went to upstairs.

27:58.780 --> 28:03.350
The dead said that it was their quiet
area and they didn't want me there.

28:03.351 --> 28:06.122
The person that I encountered...

28:06.123 --> 28:09.712
He basically was this
group of people's leader.

28:09.713 --> 28:14.393
And he is trying to
enforce a safety zone.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.084
For some of the dead here.

28:17.085 --> 28:19.521
He was kind of white-ish and tall,

28:19.522 --> 28:24.704
and he was projecting himself as
being younger than he actually is.

28:24.705 --> 28:28.340
And he told me, you better
leave or I'm going to hurt you.

28:28.341 --> 28:33.446
He definitely has the capability
of doing whatever he wants.

28:33.447 --> 28:38.585
Could that person, that's that advanced,
take a man that size and throw him?

28:38.586 --> 28:40.806
Um, yeah.

28:40.872 --> 28:45.148
I was asked to meet someone
at the grand staircase.

28:45.149 --> 28:49.169
As I was on about the sixth step.

28:49.430 --> 28:52.550
Something grabbed me...

28:53.567 --> 28:56.559
And threw me over...

28:56.560 --> 28:58.805
- The rail.
- Whoa.

28:58.806 --> 29:01.327
Describe what you saw.

29:01.328 --> 29:03.683
The chest... huge.

29:03.684 --> 29:07.725
- Like something's on steroids, okay?
- Mm hmm, okay.

29:07.726 --> 29:11.083
I can see the muscles,
like he's very ripped.

29:11.084 --> 29:13.613
- Mm hmm.
- Does that make sense to you?

29:13.614 --> 29:16.254
Yes, absolutely.

29:19.419 --> 29:21.494
What else did you see on your walk?

29:21.495 --> 29:23.329
I met a lot of strange people.

29:23.330 --> 29:25.525
It was kind of interesting,
because at one point

29:25.526 --> 29:27.882
I was seeing a lot of
professional people.

29:27.883 --> 29:30.145
And it was a weird contrast.

29:30.146 --> 29:33.821
Then I ran into this other guy who was
just, like, so out of it and so lost.

29:33.822 --> 29:37.144
They were just bashing,
banging on all of the walls.

29:37.145 --> 29:41.470
So, then, I saw, like, a
bunch of little old people.

29:41.471 --> 29:43.554
And one of the little
old ladies said to me,

29:43.555 --> 29:46.196
she's like, yeah, this is
just like a processing plant.

29:46.197 --> 29:48.910
And then the guy I was with
turned to me and he goes...

29:48.911 --> 29:52.013
Don't listen to them,
they're all bunch of lunatics.

29:52.014 --> 29:57.112
This is easy enough to explain to you, you
could take your pick on who you ran into.

29:57.113 --> 30:01.624
Because this place operated as a
Sanatorium from the early 1900s till 1980.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.905
And it was started by this
gentleman right here...

30:04.906 --> 30:07.426
John C. King.

30:07.945 --> 30:11.092
They treated people here
from depression to drug abuse,

30:11.093 --> 30:14.181
alcohol abuse, up to
full blown Schizophrenia.

30:14.182 --> 30:16.222
Really?

30:17.114 --> 30:21.127
Does it make sense to you about why you
ran into all those different... yeah.

30:21.128 --> 30:24.291
Now, that's part of your draw,
that this was a Sanatorium,

30:24.292 --> 30:27.334
and you're trying to bring back
the whole grandeur of this building.

30:27.335 --> 30:29.163
- What it was at one time.
- Yes.

30:29.164 --> 30:32.600
Once you come into the
building, you're drawn to it.

30:32.601 --> 30:38.501
You just, you want to restore it. You want
to bring it back to its original glory.

30:39.127 --> 30:40.917
So, what else did you see?

30:40.918 --> 30:44.279
I, physically, had a
very difficult time.

30:44.280 --> 30:48.082
I felt like my head was being
crushed in, I couldn't breathe.

30:48.083 --> 30:51.023
A lot of the people I
encountered were also having pain.

30:51.024 --> 30:56.324
There was one young girl that I saw
who was having seizures and vomiting.

30:56.325 --> 31:00.928
Then there was a woman that I met
downstairs who felt like she was burning.

31:00.929 --> 31:04.829
She was also shaking,
and I do think that living

31:04.830 --> 31:07.518
people who spend a lot
of time here would...

31:07.519 --> 31:12.019
Be prone to having
symptoms of illnesses.

31:12.671 --> 31:14.611
Marcelle, this is probably
a good time for you to

31:14.612 --> 31:17.470
tell Amy about the incident
with your husband Don.

31:17.471 --> 31:19.280
Don has a pacemaker.

31:19.281 --> 31:22.157
It's set to go at 60 beats.

31:22.158 --> 31:26.515
And it was racing into
the 130s beats per minutes.

31:26.516 --> 31:28.541
The doctors couldn't explain it.

31:28.542 --> 31:31.993
He has problems with his
pacemaker every time he comes in.

31:31.994 --> 31:35.237
Now, you've got to know
something about the Sanatorium.

31:35.238 --> 31:39.901
Back in the day, it had some pretty
primitive ideas of treatment here.

31:39.902 --> 31:42.202
You mentioned somebody who
was shaking, and felt burning,

31:42.203 --> 31:44.839
and all this other stuff,
and this was a woman, right?

31:44.840 --> 31:47.095
They had an instrument
here called Mighty Mouse,

31:47.096 --> 31:49.901
that they'd wheel from room to room
and they did electroshock therapy.

31:49.902 --> 31:50.912
Okay.

31:50.913 --> 31:53.247
Now, do you think that's what
that woman was going through?

31:53.248 --> 31:55.001
Yeah, that I think so.

31:55.002 --> 31:59.320
I'm trained in psychology, so I'm very
familiar with electroshock therapy.

31:59.321 --> 32:01.435
And now that I know what
this building used to be,

32:01.436 --> 32:05.714
I realize that's what it must feel like.

32:05.715 --> 32:10.596
There's a lot of dead
people here who feel trapped.

32:10.597 --> 32:12.787
And they were banging on
the windows because they

32:12.788 --> 32:14.733
want to get out, they want help.

32:14.734 --> 32:17.020
I had them sketch that.

32:17.021 --> 32:19.556
They were very pale.

32:19.557 --> 32:22.437
And extremely thin.

32:22.448 --> 32:24.908
Skeleton-ish.

32:31.667 --> 32:34.370
- Is this what you saw?
- Mm hmm.

32:34.371 --> 32:38.040
And you wanted to come back in here?

32:38.041 --> 32:41.938
You've got more guts than I do.
I wouldn't want to come back in.

32:41.939 --> 32:44.399
Oh, my gosh.

32:47.211 --> 32:50.653
- Sad.
- That's amazing. Very sad.

32:50.654 --> 32:53.751
Do you think it could have possibly
been patients that were here?

32:53.752 --> 32:56.659
Now, I'm thinking yeah, probably.

32:56.660 --> 32:58.880
Very sad.

32:59.797 --> 33:02.932
Now, is there any reason
why they're trapped?

33:02.933 --> 33:04.088
Yeah.

33:04.089 --> 33:06.657
So, when I first got here,

33:06.658 --> 33:09.275
there was a male...

33:09.276 --> 33:12.510
Who was having me call him Uncle.

33:12.511 --> 33:16.170
I know he was in charge, he
was very powerful, very wealthy.

33:16.171 --> 33:19.650
When he started this, he
started it with good intentions.

33:19.651 --> 33:22.716
And he was very odd-looking himself.

33:22.717 --> 33:25.189
He was completely bald.

33:25.190 --> 33:30.254
The other thing with this Uncle
was that he was kind of a pervert.

33:30.255 --> 33:34.031
And he really likes to do
things inappropriate to women.

33:34.032 --> 33:35.899
Let me ask you a question,
does he touch women?

33:35.900 --> 33:37.901
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

33:37.902 --> 33:41.572
Well, explain the boiler room to her.

33:41.573 --> 33:45.473
Women who enter, they're drained.

33:45.544 --> 33:50.682
Down to the point that
they're just ready to pass out.

33:50.683 --> 33:54.625
And there's inappropriate touching...

33:54.626 --> 33:57.124
In there as well.

33:57.125 --> 34:02.184
And that's the reason we do not
allow women by themselves in there.

34:02.185 --> 34:06.270
You know, a lot of things you
said reminds me of the guy that

34:06.271 --> 34:11.601
actually built this place in 1892,
the original founder of the building.

34:11.601 --> 34:13.431
Now...

34:13.431 --> 34:16.922
This is George Miles now, you mentioned
that he started out with good intentions.

34:16.924 --> 34:19.273
He opened this up as a boys school.

34:19.274 --> 34:22.188
And it was basically a
preparatory school for...

34:22.188 --> 34:26.804
Um, young men to lead them on
to a good path, so to speak.

34:26.806 --> 34:31.297
This guy was well-connected,
knew a lot of influential people.

34:31.297 --> 34:35.329
Many people said he was
scheming, ambitious, abrasive.

34:35.330 --> 34:36.826
This is the way they described him.

34:36.827 --> 34:38.827
People thought he was a
little bit money-hungry.

34:38.828 --> 34:40.042
Oh.

34:40.043 --> 34:45.268
Now, three years after he left the school,
he got diagnosed with severe liver cancer.

34:45.268 --> 34:48.103
He was given early forms of chemotherapy

34:48.103 --> 34:50.435
and radiation, and he
lost all of his hair.

34:50.436 --> 34:54.755
And he died within a couple of months.

34:57.580 --> 34:59.749
What else did you see?

34:59.750 --> 35:04.812
In the boiler room, when I walked
in there, I saw a male and a female.

35:04.813 --> 35:08.057
And it seemed like she
was kind of teasing him.

35:08.058 --> 35:12.328
He went in to kiss her. She
wasn't going to let it happen.

35:12.329 --> 35:14.630
And then he started hitting her.

35:14.631 --> 35:16.966
And she was screaming and crying.

35:16.967 --> 35:21.552
And I believe there was
a rape that followed that.

35:21.553 --> 35:24.543
Do you think the girl that was
raped was killed, that you saw?

35:24.544 --> 35:27.664
Mm, yeah, I think so.

35:29.279 --> 35:33.359
Back on June 28, 1980, this girl...

35:34.224 --> 35:37.947
It breaks my heart to
even talk about this story.

35:37.948 --> 35:41.271
Her name was Gina Hall.
She was 18 years old.

35:41.272 --> 35:45.212
Look at this kid. She's
everybody's daughter.

35:45.213 --> 35:47.730
She went to one of
the clubs here in town.

35:47.731 --> 35:49.669
She ran into a guy, Stephen Epperly.

35:49.670 --> 35:53.470
She went dancing, this guy was
a charmer, good looking guy.

35:53.471 --> 35:56.673
He convinces her to drive
him to a friend's lake house.

35:56.674 --> 36:00.994
That's the last time she's ever seen.

36:02.145 --> 36:05.189
Here's a picture of him.

36:05.190 --> 36:07.784
The guy in the middle...
this is at his trial.

36:07.785 --> 36:10.530
They believe what happened is
she went back to the lake house,

36:10.531 --> 36:13.073
he made some sexual advances
that she didn't like...

36:13.074 --> 36:15.593
And he killed her.

36:15.594 --> 36:18.194
Probably raped her.

36:18.195 --> 36:22.999
Her car that she drove him in was
found literally yards from here.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.335
Her body's never been recovered.

36:25.336 --> 36:27.238
There's two theories as to where she is.

36:27.239 --> 36:31.475
She was either thrown in the water, or
she's buried somewhere on this property.

36:31.476 --> 36:33.876
Oh, my God.

36:35.899 --> 36:37.819
Geez.

36:40.884 --> 36:42.919
Pretty impressive walk you already did.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.687
What else did you see?

36:44.688 --> 36:49.825
Towards the end of the walk, when I was in
the basement after all that, I got jumped.

36:49.826 --> 36:54.096
What happened has only happened a
handful of times as a professional.

36:54.097 --> 36:59.997
I couldn't finish the walk because
this woman got inside of me.

37:01.571 --> 37:03.440
And how long did it take
you to get rid of her?

37:03.441 --> 37:06.362
Maybe, like, six to eight hours.

37:06.363 --> 37:08.578
Now, we've done over 50 cases together.

37:08.579 --> 37:11.965
This is the first time I'm hearing
her not being able to finish a walk.

37:11.966 --> 37:13.597
Yeah.

37:13.598 --> 37:17.087
So, she continued to stay with me.

37:17.088 --> 37:20.557
We left, I was in the
car crying hysterically.

37:20.558 --> 37:26.426
What she told me was that there's a
lot of dead people here who can do this.

37:26.427 --> 37:31.804
Uh, that they can do it to
people who are open or closed...

37:31.805 --> 37:35.806
Who have abilities, don't,
or they can follow them.

37:35.807 --> 37:41.105
And they can influence a person to make
anything from just simple bad decisions to,

37:41.106 --> 37:45.314
you know, harming themselves
or harming somebody else.

37:45.315 --> 37:47.095
Is it possible...

37:47.096 --> 37:50.576
For someone to be jumped...

37:50.659 --> 37:56.233
And not realize it and change
their whole demeanor, their whole...

37:56.234 --> 37:59.630
Personality, and change
their relationships?

37:59.631 --> 38:01.632
Absolutely.

38:01.633 --> 38:05.353
I think it's changed my life.

38:06.470 --> 38:08.604
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:08.605 --> 38:10.525
Yeah.

38:12.246 --> 38:15.687
It's just a tough subject to talk about.

38:15.688 --> 38:18.368
You're talking about
you or somebody else?

38:18.369 --> 38:20.170
Someone else.

38:20.171 --> 38:23.552
Speaking with Marcelle, I feel
she's holding something back.

38:23.553 --> 38:26.507
And knowing that her husband,
Don, refused to come to the reveal.

38:26.508 --> 38:29.795
I started putting together why.

38:29.796 --> 38:33.120
If they have an ailment, are they
more susceptible to being jumped?

38:33.121 --> 38:34.949
Yes.

38:34.950 --> 38:39.750
I have an idea of who
you're talking about.

38:44.825 --> 38:47.945
I need a few minutes.

39:09.479 --> 39:12.867
If they have an ailment, are they
more susceptible to being jumped?

39:12.868 --> 39:13.882
Yes.

39:13.883 --> 39:18.683
I have an idea of who
you're talking about.

39:23.693 --> 39:28.073
I need a few minutes, guys. I'm sorry.

39:39.689 --> 39:44.627
Guys, I want to apologize for becoming
so emotional a little while ago.

39:44.628 --> 39:47.230
I don't know how else to explain it.

39:47.231 --> 39:51.395
Since I've become involved in this
building, I've seen people's lives

39:51.396 --> 39:55.605
that have kind of changed,
relationships that have changed.

39:55.606 --> 40:00.013
And it's caused some
problems in my own home.

40:00.014 --> 40:02.909
Nice people became...

40:02.910 --> 40:05.670
Angry or unhappy.

40:06.310 --> 40:11.110
And, hopefully, you can
give us some answers.

40:12.187 --> 40:16.162
You've been hit with a lot of
disturbing information tonight.

40:16.163 --> 40:18.162
But the biggest question
is can you turn this

40:18.163 --> 40:21.669
historic building into
a museum and be safe?

40:21.670 --> 40:27.010
For that answer, I'm going
to turn it over to Amy.

40:29.205 --> 40:32.422
This cannot become what you want it.

40:32.423 --> 40:35.903
With what's going on here.

40:37.046 --> 40:40.209
It's far too dangerous.

40:40.210 --> 40:43.219
As far as what to do here...

40:43.220 --> 40:48.191
Go into the largest room you
have here and do a mass funeral.

40:48.192 --> 40:52.812
Get several different
types of holy people.

40:52.844 --> 40:55.825
That way you're hitting as
many religions as possible,

40:55.826 --> 40:59.511
so that the people who are dead here

40:59.512 --> 41:02.838
who feel an affinity for
that religion, they'll go.

41:02.839 --> 41:07.777
This has to happen three
times over a one month period.

41:07.778 --> 41:13.678
One month later, you're going to have
to have an exorcism of the location...

41:13.750 --> 41:16.362
The entire location.

41:16.363 --> 41:20.766
Because unfortunately, you do
have, now, these nasty people.

41:20.767 --> 41:23.537
They're going to jump
people, they've gone bad.

41:23.538 --> 41:26.261
- Will that get everybody out of here?
- Yeah.

41:26.262 --> 41:29.022
I'm just amazed.

41:29.759 --> 41:32.267
We knew there were things going on here.

41:32.268 --> 41:34.872
- Yeah.
- You've answered a lot of our questions.

41:34.873 --> 41:36.757
The next question is the obvious one...

41:36.758 --> 41:39.667
Are you going to
listen to what Amy says?

41:39.668 --> 41:42.210
Well, we asked her to come
in to give us the solution,

41:42.211 --> 41:45.549
so I think we need to
follow through on it.

41:45.550 --> 41:48.385
If they don't do it, is
it going to get worse here?

41:48.386 --> 41:50.888
Well, I wouldn't come back.

41:50.889 --> 41:54.400
She ain't coming back, you've got
problems. I've got news for you.

41:54.401 --> 41:56.767
With all of the dead
inside this location...

41:56.768 --> 41:59.464
Marcelle and Chuck have
their work cut out for them.

41:59.465 --> 42:02.409
But I'm confident that if
they follow my advice...

42:02.410 --> 42:08.310
They'll be able to keep their
guests and employees safe from harm.

42:09.305 --> 42:15.499
