00:35.452 --> 00:36.785
<i>Game over.</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:39.371
<i>I'll fucking kill you!</i>

00:39.456 --> 00:43.959
<i>You fucking bitch!</i>

00:45.962 --> 00:48.047
<i>I'll fucking kill you!</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:52.009
<i>No! Why?</i>

02:16.719 --> 02:18.887
Daniel!

05:15.148 --> 05:16.356
Secure the flank!

05:16.399 --> 05:18.608
Left side clear.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.152
We're clear!

05:20.236 --> 05:22.529
- Left side clear.
- Let's move!

05:35.752 --> 05:37.252
Oh, my God.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.298
Someone call Kerry.

05:41.716 --> 05:45.010
The call came in at 11:45.
The woman heard an explosion.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.636
The fire department
was the first on the scene.

05:46.721 --> 05:47.846
Kerry.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.182
- Is it him?
- Before you go in there...

05:50.266 --> 05:52.601
Eric. Is it him?

05:52.643 --> 05:54.353
We don't know yet.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.613
It's not Detective Matthews.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.336
What happened?

06:19.420 --> 06:22.339
The victim was held in place
by these chains.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.004
<i>Hello, Troy.</i>

07:04.632 --> 07:06.425
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

07:07.176 --> 07:09.678
<i>This game will take place
in a room not much bigger</i>

07:09.762 --> 07:12.764
<i>than the room
you've spent most of your life in,</i>

07:12.849 --> 07:14.850
<i>a prison cell.</i>

07:14.892 --> 07:19.104
<i>Despite all of the advantages and privileges
that you were given at birth,</i>

07:19.188 --> 07:22.983
<i>you have returned
to prison again and again,</i>

07:23.025 --> 07:26.194
<i>more comfortable in chains
than you are in freedom.</i>

07:26.279 --> 07:29.364
<i>Tonight, we will see
how far you are willing to go</i>

07:29.407 --> 07:32.951
<i>to break those chains once and for all.</i>

07:33.035 --> 07:36.621
<i>Live or die, Troy. Make your choice.</i>

07:55.516 --> 07:57.809
This was the bomb.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.980
All he had to do was release himself
from each of the chains,

08:03.649 --> 08:06.902
walk out the door before it went off.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.281
All he had to do?

08:56.118 --> 08:57.702
Oh, God!

09:33.823 --> 09:35.198
Fuck! Fuck!

09:53.301 --> 09:55.677
I really had this feeling
it was going to be him.

09:55.720 --> 10:00.932
Kerry, Eric is a missing-person case,
not a homicide case.

10:03.102 --> 10:07.063
I've been having nightmares
where I see him.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.863
I'm never going to be able
to forgive myself for what happened.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.324
Listen, it's not your fault.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.160
- It's always somebody's fault.
- Yeah, but that somebody isn't you.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.537
That someone is still out there,

10:22.580 --> 10:28.126
so put all your anger into finding them
and putting them away, all right?

10:28.878 --> 10:33.506
What I don't understand is,
how the hell could Jigsaw do all of this?

10:33.549 --> 10:36.718
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.555
I'm not so sure he did.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.932
So far,
this doesn't follow any of his patterns.

10:43.017 --> 10:47.520
- Meaning?
- Well, how did you get in here?

10:47.563 --> 10:49.356
- We cut the door down.
- Why?

10:49.398 --> 10:52.442
Because somebody heard an explosion
and called us.

10:52.526 --> 10:55.362
I mean,
why did you have to cut the door down?

10:55.404 --> 10:58.406
It was welded shut.
Bloody truck couldn't get in here.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.076
- Exactly.
- I don't follow.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.912
If the aim of Jigsaw's game
was to get out before the bomb went off,

11:03.954 --> 11:06.164
then why was the door welded shut?

11:06.248 --> 11:08.083
The guy couldn't get out if he wanted to.

11:08.167 --> 11:11.419
You won't believe this.
We got the tape out clean.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.473
<i>Hello, Troy.</i>

12:05.516 --> 12:07.142
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

12:09.395 --> 12:12.897
<i>Live or die, Troy. Make your choice.</i>

14:12.059 --> 14:13.518
<i>Hello, Kerry.</i>

14:14.812 --> 14:16.855
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

14:16.939 --> 14:20.233
<i>Up until now,
you have spent your life among the dead,</i>

14:20.276 --> 14:22.443
<i>piecing together their final moments.</i>

14:22.486 --> 14:27.240
<i>You are good at this
because you, like them, are also dead,</i>

14:27.283 --> 14:30.285
<i>dead on the inside.</i>

14:30.327 --> 14:36.291
<i>You identify more with a cold corpse
than you do with a living human.</i>

14:36.333 --> 14:39.377
<i>I believe you want to join your true family,</i>

14:39.461 --> 14:42.589
<i>indeed your only family, in death.</i>

14:43.841 --> 14:48.011
<i>The device you are wearing
is hooked into your ribcage,</i>

14:48.095 --> 14:53.975
<i>and by the time this tape is finished,
you will have one minute to find a way out.</i>

14:54.018 --> 14:55.643
<i>At the end of that minute,</i>

14:55.686 --> 14:59.981
<i>you should know better than anyone
what happens then.</i>

15:00.024 --> 15:03.651
<i>There is a simple key
that will unlock the harness, Kerry.</i>

15:03.736 --> 15:05.320
<i>It is right in front of you.</i>

15:05.362 --> 15:09.073
<i>All you have to do is reach in and take it,</i>

15:10.534 --> 15:12.076
<i>but do it quickly.</i>

15:12.161 --> 15:16.247
<i>The acid will dissolve the key
in a matter of seconds.</i>

15:17.666 --> 15:19.334
<i>Make your choice.</i>

16:39.748 --> 16:41.290
No!

16:53.345 --> 16:54.429
You.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.554
I've got to be at the hospital by 9:00.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.476
It's Tuesday. I thought you started at 11:00.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.146
Yeah, well,
they change things on me last minute.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.565
Well, you better head off, then.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.282
You're not gonna take a shower?

17:57.201 --> 17:58.284
No.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.455
I'm just going to take a shower
at the hospital.

18:02.498 --> 18:06.125
Can we just talk for five minutes?

18:07.044 --> 18:10.546
Okay, how about we just make eye contact
for five seconds?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.381
What's wrong?

18:12.466 --> 18:16.511
Nothing. Just everything.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.389
Lynn.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.184
What is it you want from me, Chris?

18:24.728 --> 18:26.104
A divorce.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.489
MVA.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.660
- Car skidded into oncoming traffic.
- BP is 80...

18:40.702 --> 18:41.702
- Pressure?
- 80 over...

18:41.787 --> 18:43.704
- Palp.
- Pulse is thready.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.748
Ready? One, two, three.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.667
- Where's Lynn?
- Page Dr. Denlon.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.876
Set up an art line.

18:48.919 --> 18:54.674
<i>Dr. Lynn Denlon,
please report to Trauma immediately.</i>

18:56.677 --> 18:57.802
Lynn!

18:59.471 --> 19:00.847
Pressure's dropping rapidly.

19:00.889 --> 19:03.766
Pressure down to 70.
He's going into shock.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.227
Get an OR ready. We gotta crack his chest.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.563
- Do we get a bolus, 500 wide open?
- No.

19:10.732 --> 19:11.858
What?

19:15.946 --> 19:17.238
- No air entry on the right side.
- And?

19:17.322 --> 19:19.782
Some blood loss. There's tension pneumo.
Let's get a chest tube in him.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.951
We gotta get him to an OR now.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.079
His stats are dropping. He's going to code.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.624
I'm doing it.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.344
I'm getting a rush of air.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.973
Stats are improving. Pressure back to 80.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.683
Pressure normal.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.619
Look, if you've got something
on your mind, go upstairs to Psych.

20:04.661 --> 20:08.080
Just don't bring it in here.
We don't have any seconds to spare, Lynn.

20:08.123 --> 20:10.333
The woman standing in front of me
had to be dragged

20:10.417 --> 20:13.461
from the locker room
to put a chest tube in a trauma patient?

20:13.503 --> 20:16.297
Lynn Denlon should have been
the first one there.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.384
Lynn.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.261
<i>Lynn!</i>

20:56.588 --> 20:58.506
What the hell?

20:58.548 --> 20:59.882
I'm locked in!

20:59.967 --> 21:01.342
Is anybody there?

21:01.969 --> 21:03.177
Hello?

21:11.395 --> 21:12.853
Anybody here?

22:34.895 --> 22:36.479
Somebody help me!

22:36.563 --> 22:39.315
Help! Help me!

22:42.444 --> 22:43.611
Help!

22:49.743 --> 22:52.244
Who are you? Who are you?

22:52.287 --> 22:53.788
What is this?

22:56.249 --> 22:58.000
What are you doing?

23:04.549 --> 23:06.384
Are you gonna behave?

23:13.850 --> 23:15.309
Let's go.

23:17.145 --> 23:19.855
What is this place? What is this place?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.990
What is this place?

23:38.792 --> 23:41.502
Who are you? Who are you?

23:46.299 --> 23:48.342
Hello, Dr. Denlon.

23:48.427 --> 23:52.471
You may not remember me,
but I most certainly remember you.

23:53.348 --> 23:58.310
I was a guest at your hospital once.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.274
Where am I?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.028
Do you remember me?

24:17.539 --> 24:19.373
I've seen you on television.

24:21.084 --> 24:23.586
Lawrence Gordon was your doctor.

24:23.670 --> 24:26.297
I was his patient, and he was mine.

24:28.008 --> 24:31.594
As you can see from that report,
my prognosis isn't good.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.473
Would you agree?

24:42.230 --> 24:45.441
There's no preventative treatment
for what you have.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.860
I remember you saying that
to me once before

24:47.903 --> 24:50.738
in almost the exact same tone.

24:50.822 --> 24:54.158
Leave it to a doctor
to find such a cold, clinical way

24:54.242 --> 24:56.660
of saying I'm a dead man walking.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.706
Looking at me,
how long would you say I have left?

25:00.749 --> 25:02.750
I'd have to examine you.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.587
Even then,
a frontal-lobe tumor is unpredictable.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.757
The growth depends on the rate
of mitosis versus apoptosis...

25:09.841 --> 25:14.470
I'm sorry, but is
all this crude medical equipment around me

25:14.554 --> 25:18.390
causing you to believe
that you're still inside a hospital?

25:18.433 --> 25:19.767
No.

25:19.851 --> 25:24.188
Then why are you speaking to me
in that graduate-school medical jargon?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.192
Look at me!

25:30.529 --> 25:32.404
Now, you look at me.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.782
I asked you a simple question.

25:34.824 --> 25:40.287
Based on your experience,
how long do you think I have left?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.581
It's not a simple answer.

25:42.624 --> 25:47.002
Based on your file, I'd say not long.

25:56.304 --> 25:58.347
Death is a surprise party

25:58.431 --> 26:03.102
unless, of course,
you're already dead on the inside,

26:07.691 --> 26:09.108
unless you're the type of person

26:09.150 --> 26:13.195
who swallows antidepressants
to hide the pain, huh?

26:13.280 --> 26:17.658
Turns their back on their husband,
neglects their child,

26:17.701 --> 26:22.746
who has every possible advantage in life
but chooses not to advance.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.832
What do you want from me?

26:26.167 --> 26:27.751
What do I want?

26:29.879 --> 26:31.463
I want to play a game.

26:34.676 --> 26:37.136
The rules of the game are simple.

26:38.305 --> 26:41.265
The consequences
for breaking them are great.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.392
Death.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.439
You're being tested.
Your will is being tested,

26:48.523 --> 26:53.277
your will to keep someone alive.
Can you do that? Can you follow the rules

26:53.361 --> 26:57.364
- and grant someone the gift of life?
- What is this? What is this? No, get it...

26:58.742 --> 27:02.494
No! No! What is this?
What are you doing to me?

27:09.711 --> 27:13.255
The device that you're wearing
is linked to my heart-rate monitor.

27:13.340 --> 27:18.052
The second that heart-rate monitor
flat-lines or you move out of range,

27:18.094 --> 27:21.055
an explosion will go off in that collar.

27:21.139 --> 27:25.559
Your life and my life
will end simultaneously.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.063
Please, please don't do this to me.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.690
I have a family. I have a family.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.276
Let me give you the simple version.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.947
You will keep him alive, whatever it takes.

27:40.075 --> 27:44.119
No excuses, no equivocations,

27:44.204 --> 27:46.080
no crying.

27:46.122 --> 27:48.666
What do you mean, keep him alive?

27:51.544 --> 27:55.964
Out there, on those screens,
we have another test subject.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.258
A man.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.972
He will face a series of tests.

28:05.225 --> 28:09.937
You have to keep John alive
until he makes it through.

28:10.814 --> 28:14.775
If he completes all of his tests,
and John is still breathing,

28:15.485 --> 28:17.945
then I will remove your collar,

28:19.489 --> 28:21.407
and you're free to go.

28:22.158 --> 28:25.411
You're a vital piece of my puzzle,
Dr. Denlon,

28:25.453 --> 28:29.039
a critical part
of what could be my final test.

28:30.667 --> 28:34.211
Amanda, it's time to start our game.

29:05.618 --> 29:06.869
Help!

29:13.001 --> 29:14.251
Hello!

29:16.963 --> 29:19.089
Is there anybody out there?

29:28.683 --> 29:30.768
<i>Hello, Jeff.</i>

29:30.852 --> 29:32.352
<i>Over the past few years,</i>

29:32.395 --> 29:36.148
<i>you have become a shell
of your former self,</i>

29:36.191 --> 29:39.359
<i>consumed with hatred and vengeance,</i>

29:39.402 --> 29:43.113
<i>vengeance against the drunk driver
who killed your only son,</i>

29:43.198 --> 29:47.993
<i>vengeance against the killer
who, to your surprise and dismay,</i>

29:48.036 --> 29:51.663
<i>was set free after a hasty trial.</i>

29:52.791 --> 29:57.377
<i>Today, however,
it is you who will be put on trial.</i>

29:57.462 --> 30:01.924
<i>To escape from where you are,
you will have to face a series of tests.</i>

30:02.008 --> 30:06.220
<i>You will have to suffer
to move forward through each of them,</i>

30:06.304 --> 30:10.224
<i>but with each one,
you will also have a chance,</i>

30:11.100 --> 30:12.893
<i>a chance to forgive.</i>

30:13.895 --> 30:15.395
<i>When you complete the tests,</i>

30:15.480 --> 30:18.774
<i>I promise you,
you will finally come face to face</i>

30:18.858 --> 30:21.944
<i>with the man responsible
for the loss of your child.</i>

30:22.028 --> 30:25.113
<i>That will be your ultimate test.</i>

30:25.865 --> 30:27.658
<i>Can you forgive him?</i>

30:29.327 --> 30:30.869
<i>You better hurry, though.</i>

30:30.912 --> 30:33.914
<i>In two hours, the doors will lock,</i>

30:33.957 --> 30:37.125
<i>and this place will become your tomb.</i>

30:37.210 --> 30:40.128
<i>This is what you've been waiting for, Jeff.</i>

30:41.047 --> 30:42.172
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

30:42.257 --> 30:44.383
Help!

31:11.619 --> 31:13.704
You fucking killed my son.

31:13.788 --> 31:16.665
Don't you fucking beg.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.960
Do you know who I am?

31:22.922 --> 31:25.841
I'm your fucking teacher, you motherfucker.

31:35.184 --> 31:37.644
This is what you fucking deserve.

31:58.124 --> 31:59.958
Where is it?

32:00.001 --> 32:01.168
What?

32:03.254 --> 32:04.671
Where is it?

32:11.638 --> 32:13.180
How many times?

32:14.515 --> 32:18.727
How many times do I have to tell you
before you get it in your head?

32:18.811 --> 32:20.479
I just wanted to sleep with something.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.023
No. No, you just nothing.

32:23.107 --> 32:27.277
You don't touch things in Dylan's room,

32:31.866 --> 32:32.991
okay?

33:23.584 --> 33:25.252
I'm sorry, Daddy.

33:33.761 --> 33:36.054
You know I love you, don't you?

33:39.267 --> 33:43.353
What do you think Mommy would say
if she saw us like this?

33:45.815 --> 33:48.275
I'm gonna go get ready for school.

34:12.132 --> 34:13.341
<i>Daddy!</i>

34:31.819 --> 34:39.819
Hello?

34:57.136 --> 34:58.220
Hey!

36:15.298 --> 36:17.507
All right, John.
I need you to look at my nose.

36:17.592 --> 36:18.925
Right here.

36:20.219 --> 36:22.304
Look at my nose, please.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.181
Follow my flashlight.

36:31.647 --> 36:34.399
Tell me if you feel any pain, all right?

36:35.151 --> 36:36.484
That hurt?

36:42.283 --> 36:43.658
It's begun.

36:45.494 --> 36:47.287
He's out of the box.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.252
So?

36:55.379 --> 36:57.797
My 20-second analysis
without any medical equipment

36:57.882 --> 36:59.883
is that his brain's herniating.

37:02.178 --> 37:05.096
He needs to go to the hospital
and have an operation

37:05.139 --> 37:07.140
to decompress his brain.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.559
Come here.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.311
- No, really. Come here.
- What?

37:11.395 --> 37:12.479
- Come here.
- No.

37:12.563 --> 37:15.106
- Let me ask you something.
- Oh, God!

37:15.524 --> 37:17.984
Did I bring John to you,

37:18.027 --> 37:21.488
or did I bring your self-centered ass
to him?

37:22.198 --> 37:25.784
Now, you better start
fucking paying attention.

37:25.826 --> 37:28.161
No one's going to any hospital.

37:31.666 --> 37:35.085
I can't perform miracles.
You're... You're giving him painkillers.

37:35.169 --> 37:37.504
For a tumor like this,
he needs steroids, Prednisone.

37:37.546 --> 37:38.672
Oh, good, yeah.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.590
Maybe we could try
some corticoid steroids,

37:40.675 --> 37:42.300
you know, like Dexamethasone.

37:42.343 --> 37:46.429
Why don't you fucking tell me something
that I don't know, you stupid cunt?

37:47.431 --> 37:52.227
The only place that he can get those drugs
is in a hospital,

37:54.605 --> 37:56.231
or else he's gonna die.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.860
You are not a good listener.

38:01.779 --> 38:05.073
I think you missed the part that if he dies,

38:06.659 --> 38:08.034
you die.

38:09.036 --> 38:11.204
You're asking me to do the impossible.

38:11.289 --> 38:14.624
I'm not asking you. He is.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.377
He chose you.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.048
- Not me.
- Amanda!

38:24.051 --> 38:26.761
Our doctor can't do
what's being asked of her

38:26.846 --> 38:28.888
if you're threatening her.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.851
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.

38:32.893 --> 38:35.854
You need to abide by those rules.

38:35.896 --> 38:37.105
Sorry.

38:56.584 --> 39:00.128
Amanda! Amanda, I need your help.

39:00.212 --> 39:02.505
Amanda, he needs oxygen.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.591
Oxygen, Amanda!

39:04.675 --> 39:06.676
Put the mask on his face.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.807
I need you to hold him down.

39:13.267 --> 39:15.852
Tip his head to the side. You got it?

39:32.953 --> 39:34.162
What are you doing?

39:34.246 --> 39:37.040
Ativan? Do you have Ativan?

39:37.124 --> 39:38.375
No!

39:40.127 --> 39:42.921
Back off! Back off! Back off! Back off!

39:45.466 --> 39:47.008
Stay with me, John.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.803
You're almost through this.
Stay with me, John.

39:53.682 --> 39:56.184
Stay with me. We're almost done with this.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.794
Was that enough for you?

40:22.837 --> 40:25.630
Are you ready to go to the hospital now?

40:26.465 --> 40:28.716
He needs to have an operation.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.680
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:34.181 --> 40:36.307
But we do it here.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.143
- We do it here.
- What?

40:38.185 --> 40:39.936
What do you need?

40:40.020 --> 40:42.355
I need anesthetic for a procedure like this.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.690
Anesthetic, what else?

40:43.732 --> 40:45.316
Even with an anesthetic...

40:45.359 --> 40:47.277
Anesthetic, what else?

40:50.364 --> 40:51.865
A power drill.

42:39.515 --> 42:42.183
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

42:44.186 --> 42:47.564
Please, please, lease, let me go.

42:48.357 --> 42:53.319
Please, why...
Why are you doing this to me?

42:53.404 --> 42:56.698
Don't... Don't kill me, okay? Please!

42:56.782 --> 43:01.202
Wait. Key, key, key. Okay, come on.

43:01.287 --> 43:02.412
Fuck!

43:03.122 --> 43:06.040
- God!
- Fuck!

43:06.125 --> 43:07.208
Okay.

43:07.293 --> 43:12.005
Please, please, I'm so cold.
I can't feel my arms. Please.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.306
<i>Welcome to your first test, Jeff.</i>

43:21.348 --> 43:24.392
<i>For the past three years,
you've cursed the name</i>

43:24.476 --> 43:29.355
<i>of all those you thought were responsible
for the death of your son.</i>

43:29.398 --> 43:32.692
<i>You fantasize those accountable will pay.</i>

43:33.569 --> 43:37.447
<i>Well, you will find a woman
in front of you chained in place.</i>

43:37.531 --> 43:40.074
<i>This will prevent her from running,</i>

43:40.159 --> 43:43.202
<i>much like she did
on the day your son was hit.</i>

43:47.333 --> 43:49.125
<i>Her name is Denica Scott.</i>

43:49.209 --> 43:53.671
<i>She was the only witness present
at the scene of your son's untimely demise.</i>

44:00.429 --> 44:04.098
<i>If not for her own self-absorption
and cowardice,</i>

44:04.183 --> 44:08.728
<i>she could have brought
your son's killer to justice.</i>

44:08.812 --> 44:13.191
<i>Now it is you
who has a chance to bring her to justice.</i>

44:14.068 --> 44:19.614
<i>You alone can grant her the gift of life
before she freezes to death.</i>

44:19.698 --> 44:21.949
<i>Behind the pipes on the back wall,</i>

44:22.034 --> 44:24.744
<i>you will find the key
that will free her and bring you</i>

44:24.787 --> 44:28.998
<i>one step closer to the man
responsible for the loss of your child.</i>

44:30.125 --> 44:33.419
<i>Will you claim the key
to save only yourself?</i>

44:33.462 --> 44:34.962
You have to help me!

44:35.047 --> 44:38.091
<i>Or can you find it within you
to save another?</i>

44:39.343 --> 44:41.010
<i>Make your choice.</i>

44:57.820 --> 44:59.237
No!

45:10.290 --> 45:12.125
I didn't do anything.

45:13.669 --> 45:16.087
I didn't do anything to you!

45:16.130 --> 45:19.006
That's exactly it. You didn't do anything.

45:20.718 --> 45:23.970
I'm fucking dying. Please...

45:24.054 --> 45:25.555
He died

45:27.182 --> 45:28.558
in my arms.

45:29.309 --> 45:33.604
My eight-year-old son died in my arms.

46:01.341 --> 46:04.343
I made a mistake.

46:05.512 --> 46:07.221
I'm so sorry.

46:07.931 --> 46:09.015
I'm human.

46:09.099 --> 46:12.602
I'm human, just like your son was, okay?

46:15.898 --> 46:17.273
Look at me.

46:18.108 --> 46:20.902
I said, look at me. Look...

46:23.697 --> 46:27.074
Oh, my God.

46:27.159 --> 46:29.368
It's so cold.

47:46.154 --> 47:48.281
Oh, God!

49:49.486 --> 49:53.239
Amanda, if you really care about John,

49:53.281 --> 49:55.074
you won't let me do this to him.

49:55.158 --> 49:57.618
You're a smart woman,
and you know what's right for him.

49:57.703 --> 49:58.869
I'm sorry.

49:58.912 --> 50:00.413
I know it's hard to concentrate

50:00.455 --> 50:03.582
when you're surrounded by so many things
you could kill me with,

50:03.667 --> 50:06.085
like this ax I saw you looking at.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.171
Take it.

50:09.256 --> 50:11.007
Please, it's yours.

50:12.092 --> 50:13.384
Come on.

50:15.095 --> 50:17.972
I'd go for the neck,
but I'm not the brain surgeon.

50:18.056 --> 50:20.641
Just do it quietly
so John doesn't hear me die.

50:20.726 --> 50:25.396
Otherwise, he's likely to get upset,
rip off his heart-rate monitor. Boom.

50:25.439 --> 50:28.691
Then you just have to find the sensor
and disarm it

50:28.775 --> 50:31.027
so you can walk more
than 30 feet out that door

50:31.111 --> 50:32.862
without the collar detonating,

50:32.946 --> 50:36.532
or you could try and take
the collar off yourself,

50:36.616 --> 50:38.284
but that could be tricky.

50:38.368 --> 50:41.370
The slightest knock
in the wrong place could trigger it.

50:41.455 --> 50:42.955
I should know.

50:46.001 --> 50:47.334
I built it.

50:51.381 --> 50:55.092
So do you have everything you need?

50:56.636 --> 50:59.388
I have the instruments
to cut someone open.

50:59.473 --> 51:02.141
I don't have the tools to save a life.

51:02.642 --> 51:05.644
You'd be surprised
what tools can save a life.

51:52.818 --> 51:54.443
<i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

51:54.528 --> 51:58.489
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

52:00.200 --> 52:02.076
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

52:04.079 --> 52:07.039
<i>There's only one key to open the device.</i>

52:11.002 --> 52:13.879
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.</i>

52:18.885 --> 52:20.261
<i>Look around, Amanda.</i>

52:20.345 --> 52:23.139
<i>Know that I'm not playing.</i>

52:23.223 --> 52:24.640
<i>Live or die.</i>

52:25.600 --> 52:27.226
<i>Make your choice.</i>

52:33.817 --> 52:36.944
<i>Congratulations. You are still alive.</i>

52:38.238 --> 52:42.449
<i>Most people are so ungrateful to be alive,</i>

52:42.534 --> 52:45.077
<i>but not you, not anymore.</i>

52:46.538 --> 52:50.416
Amanda, do not be afraid.

52:51.001 --> 52:53.043
<i>Your life has just begun.</i>

53:10.687 --> 53:13.272
He made it through the freezer room.

53:16.484 --> 53:18.319
He tried to save her.

53:29.497 --> 53:32.750
There are some things

53:34.628 --> 53:37.296
I need you to do for me.

53:37.339 --> 53:42.051
In my desk, in the center drawer,

53:42.135 --> 53:43.636
an envelope

53:44.804 --> 53:46.639
with your name on it.

53:49.976 --> 53:52.436
She's gonna do a procedure on you.

53:53.813 --> 53:56.815
- Yeah?
- To relieve the pressure on your brain...

53:56.900 --> 54:00.152
- Yeah?
- ...and help with the headaches.

54:08.828 --> 54:10.079
I can't do this.

54:10.163 --> 54:12.665
Amanda, you can.

54:12.749 --> 54:14.583
You can.

54:14.668 --> 54:16.460
You're stronger now,

54:18.505 --> 54:20.589
and I believe in you.

54:25.929 --> 54:28.847
You chose her 'cause she's the best, right?

54:30.642 --> 54:32.893
That's one reason I chose her.

56:23.004 --> 56:24.254
Damn it!

56:25.465 --> 56:26.632
Hello?

56:27.300 --> 56:28.967
Help me, please!

56:33.473 --> 56:35.099
Please, help me!

56:38.144 --> 56:39.561
I'm in here!

56:42.982 --> 56:45.025
Please get me out of here!

56:45.860 --> 56:47.319
Help me! I...

56:51.991 --> 56:53.200
Hello?

56:54.661 --> 56:55.994
I know you're there.

56:56.079 --> 56:58.122
Please! Please help me!

57:02.168 --> 57:05.504
I can hear you. Please, answer me!

57:06.297 --> 57:07.506
Help me!

57:10.593 --> 57:11.802
Please!

57:12.470 --> 57:13.679
Help me!

57:17.058 --> 57:20.018
Get me out of here, please! Please help me!

57:20.061 --> 57:21.562
Get me out of here!

57:21.646 --> 57:22.855
Please!

57:24.065 --> 57:26.400
Don't just stand there! Help me!

57:30.780 --> 57:34.491
<i>Jeff, when the judge
presiding over your case</i>

57:34.534 --> 57:39.413
<i>sentenced your boy's murderer so lightly,
your soul never recovered.</i>

57:39.497 --> 57:44.293
<i>Now you have the power to sentence
his soul straight to hell,</i>

57:44.377 --> 57:46.420
<i>or you can forgive.</i>

57:46.504 --> 57:50.424
<i>The key that will free him
is hidden inside your son's possessions,</i>

57:51.551 --> 57:55.179
<i>possessions you have clung to
for far too long.</i>

57:56.055 --> 57:59.683
<i>Now, if you flip the switch
on the incinerator underneath you,</i>

57:59.726 --> 58:04.021
<i>a fire will cleanse you of this obsession
and destroy them all,</i>

58:04.063 --> 58:06.398
<i>leaving only the key remaining.</i>

58:06.483 --> 58:08.901
<i>It is also the key that will bring you closer</i>

58:08.943 --> 58:12.529
<i>to the man accountable
for taking your child.</i>

58:12.572 --> 58:15.616
<i>He doesn't have much time, Jeff.
Let the game begin.</i>

58:15.700 --> 58:18.243
Please get me out of here. Please!

58:22.415 --> 58:23.916
What is that?

58:29.923 --> 58:31.131
What's that sound?

59:10.630 --> 59:13.382
I'm a criminal court judge, for Christ's sake!

59:13.466 --> 59:15.133
You can't do this to me!

59:16.761 --> 59:18.637
You don't remember me?

59:22.809 --> 59:25.811
Well, maybe you remember
Timothy Young?

59:32.944 --> 59:35.904
He was the driver who killed my son.

59:35.989 --> 59:37.990
You gave him six months!

59:38.741 --> 59:42.327
Okay, all right, we can talk about your case.

59:42.370 --> 59:44.162
Obviously you want answers.

59:44.247 --> 59:46.665
I can't give them to you like this.

59:47.250 --> 59:48.667
Does this hurt?

59:50.128 --> 59:52.087
You give more for fucking parking tickets!

59:52.171 --> 59:53.589
Listen to me.

59:53.673 --> 59:56.550
I can see that you're in a great deal of pain,

59:56.634 --> 01:00:00.345
but there are ways
that we can have his sentence extended.

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.847
I can help you!

01:00:01.889 --> 01:00:03.682
It's too late!

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:05.934
They let him go!

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:08.020
Don't become what he is!

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:11.273
Don't become a killer!

01:00:11.357 --> 01:00:14.526
Please, I have a son, too.

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:25.203
Where are you going?

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.665
You gotta help me!

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.380
I'm so sorry!

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:41.637
Oh, God.

01:00:43.264 --> 01:00:44.931
You're killing me!

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:49.603
Don't do this to me! I'm gonna die!

01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:57.903
Fuck you!

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:00.822
Fuck you, you...

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:02.574
You gotta help me!

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:04.242
Shut the fuck up.

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.659
Help!

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:45.969
Come on!

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:40.899
He made it through the second test.

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:43.693
The judge is alive.

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:46.571
Faster than I expected.

01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:50.617
All right, John, I need you
to keep your head to the side

01:03:50.701 --> 01:03:52.160
and keep still.

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:56.414
What's going on here is that your brain
is pushing against your skull.

01:03:56.457 --> 01:04:00.710
I'm gonna try to relieve the pressure
by cutting away a little bit of your skull.

01:04:00.753 --> 01:04:05.298
It should help you with your headaches
and drastically improve your motor skills.

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:07.551
Do you understand?

01:04:07.593 --> 01:04:09.594
All too well.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:21.690
All right, you're gonna feel
some slight discomfort.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.110
Are you gonna give him
a general anesthetic?

01:04:25.152 --> 01:04:28.655
For a procedure like this,
the patient needs to be fully alert.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.497
Okay.

01:05:17.788 --> 01:05:19.789
Amanda, I need you here.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:22.918
Amanda.

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:28.465
All right, John,
you're gonna feel some pressure.

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:42.103
Let's clip this, stop the bleeding.

01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:58.870
Fill that syringe
with alcohol from that bowl.

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:04.042
Hurry.

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:15.762
All right, John,
I need you to keep your mouth closed.

01:06:15.846 --> 01:06:18.264
You're gonna hear a lot of noise.

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:19.951
- John, how you doing?
- Never better.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:23.621
All right.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:36.634
All right, you're gonna hear a lot of ringing.

01:07:36.677 --> 01:07:38.970
I need you to stay very still.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:41.598
Here I go.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:28.103
All right, John, I'm gonna remove the skull.

01:08:54.004 --> 01:08:55.630
He's stabilized.

01:08:58.008 --> 01:09:01.219
John, I need you to raise your hand
and flex your fingers.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.935
John?

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.770
John, raise your hand.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.733
John, can you hear me?

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.654
What's happening?

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:22.407
John.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:25.326
What's happening to him?

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:27.078
What's happening?

01:09:28.788 --> 01:09:30.290
What's wrong?

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:38.631
<i>What's wrong?</i>

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.093
<i>Why isn't he moving?</i>

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:44.929
Do something!

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.930
Please.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:52.187
Stay with me, John.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:55.773
Good.

01:09:57.109 --> 01:09:59.110
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:03.281
Breathe! Breathe, damn it! Breathe, John.

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:05.658
I love...

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:07.619
Breathe.

01:10:12.124 --> 01:10:13.208
I...

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.002
I love you.

01:10:49.995 --> 01:10:52.330
You will give everything to me.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.251
Every cell in your body.

01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:59.921
Is that understood?

01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:02.131
Yes.

01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:09.264
The marks on your arms,
they're from another life.

01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:13.184
We'll leave that life behind.

01:11:15.562 --> 01:11:18.022
When you go down that corridor,

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:26.447
there is no turning back.
Do you understand that?

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.201
Yes.

01:11:30.911 --> 01:11:32.745
Then start with this.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:45.591
Go.

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:10.825
<i>Who is that?</i>

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:13.453
<i>Who's in there?</i>

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:20.251
<i>I'll kill you, you motherfucker!</i>

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:35.118
Put his left leg in the shackle.

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:02.788
It's time to start our game.

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:32.777
What's that?

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:37.740
Slow my heart rate, relax my muscles.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.579
It's time.

01:15:47.834 --> 01:15:49.919
Close the door behind you.

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:32.229
He can't hear you.

01:17:32.272 --> 01:17:34.732
He doesn't even know you're there.

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:45.159
Amanda.

01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:48.079
Put it away.

01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:49.914
Trust me.

01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:52.541
Put it away.

01:17:57.297 --> 01:17:58.881
Leave us alone.

01:17:59.966 --> 01:18:01.092
Now.

01:18:01.885 --> 01:18:03.844
You fucking freak.

01:18:05.597 --> 01:18:08.224
I apologize for her behavior.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.477
She swims in my sea.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:17.650
In the end, she will be the closest
I've ever come to a connection,

01:18:17.734 --> 01:18:19.735
to being understood,

01:18:22.614 --> 01:18:26.909
but her emotion is also her weakness.

01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:19.003
Adam.

01:19:27.512 --> 01:19:30.639
Come here. I'm gonna help you.

01:19:31.975 --> 01:19:33.726
I'm gonna help you.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:39.774
I'm gonna free you.

01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:08.779
I'm so sorry about your son, Jeff,

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:14.952
but let me tell you something that I...
That I know for sure.

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:18.664
No sentence I gave him, not 500 years,

01:21:18.748 --> 01:21:22.334
not even death, nothing,
will take your pain away,

01:21:24.087 --> 01:21:26.797
and vengeance doesn't solve anything.

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:29.717
It only makes the pain greater, Jeff.

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:54.325
What the... What the fuck?

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.328
Somebody help me!

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:00.456
What the fuck?

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:04.585
Help.

01:22:10.508 --> 01:22:13.260
What the... What the fuck are you doing?

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:17.264
Please help me.

01:22:18.558 --> 01:22:20.392
<i>Hello, Jeff.</i>

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:22.144
<i>If you are listening to this,</i>

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:26.857
<i>that means that the confrontation
you so long dreamed of</i>

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.734
<i>is finally unfolding.</i>

01:22:28.818 --> 01:22:30.527
Do something!

01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:35.616
<i>In your head, he is a cipher,
a symbol of your life changing,</i>

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.951
<i>a symbol of death.</i>

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:41.205
<i>I present him to you now
as a simple human being.</i>

01:22:42.582 --> 01:22:44.083
<i>His name is Timothy Young.</i>

01:22:44.167 --> 01:22:45.793
<i>He's 27 years old,</i>

01:22:45.877 --> 01:22:48.462
<i>a medical student
with a mother and a father</i>

01:22:48.546 --> 01:22:50.214
<i>just like you,</i>

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:54.301
<i>a man whose life also changed
the day your son died.</i>

01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:01.141
<i>That day, he made a terrible mistake.</i>

01:23:06.731 --> 01:23:12.236
<i>You believe he didn't pay for that mistake,
and now is your chance to make him pay.</i>

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:16.991
<i>The device Timothy is strapped to
is my personal favorite.</i>

01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:18.534
<i>I call it the rack.</i>

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:27.418
<i>The human body is a miraculous creation.</i>

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:31.338
<i>Ever wonder how far the arm can twist?</i>

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:34.341
<i>This device is going to start twisting.</i>

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:37.136
<i>There is a chance he might live,
though, with your help.</i>

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:38.262
Please.

01:23:38.304 --> 01:23:40.681
<i>To your right is a box.</i>

01:23:40.765 --> 01:23:43.100
<i>At the back of the box is a key.</i>

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:45.978
<i>It's tied to the trigger of a shotgun.</i>

01:23:46.062 --> 01:23:48.772
<i>The question you have to ask yourself
is this.</i>

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.277
<i>- Are you willing...</i>
- Have mercy!

01:23:53.319 --> 01:23:56.447
<i>...to take a bullet for the man
who killed your son?</i>

01:23:56.489 --> 01:23:59.742
<i>Does "Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you"</i>

01:23:59.784 --> 01:24:01.618
<i>apply here, Jeff?</i>

01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:03.203
<i>Make your choice.</i>

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.004
My God.

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:05.516
You've got to help him, Jeff!

01:25:12.732 --> 01:25:13.816
Fuck!

01:25:13.858 --> 01:25:17.528
Please stop! Stop! Stop! Please stop!

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:40.134
Jeff!

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:43.220
Just standing there,
you're an accomplice to murder.

01:25:44.097 --> 01:25:46.306
Are you a murderer?

01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:48.267
I've wanted to kill him every day.

01:25:48.351 --> 01:25:52.187
- Oh, my God!
- For three years, I wanted to kill you.

01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:54.898
Yeah, maybe I am.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:57.526
- You'll lose your family.
- Oh, my God!

01:25:57.569 --> 01:26:00.696
- Your wife, your daughter.
- Oh, God!

01:26:03.074 --> 01:26:04.199
Fuck!

01:26:14.919 --> 01:26:16.170
Oh, God.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:20.257
Okay.

01:26:23.469 --> 01:26:24.928
Hold on, son.

01:26:47.493 --> 01:26:50.120
Hold on. Don't give up.

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:51.663
Come on, son.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.625
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:26:56.127 --> 01:26:57.211
Son.

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:10.307
Got the key.

01:27:25.448 --> 01:27:29.076
Help me!

01:27:37.543 --> 01:27:39.253
- Help me!
- Stop!

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:42.172
I forgive him!

01:27:45.009 --> 01:27:47.719
I forgive him! No!

01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:49.513
No!

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.224
God!

01:27:54.227 --> 01:27:56.144
God damn you!

01:28:30.179 --> 01:28:31.888
Don't you think it would be wise

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:35.058
to engage me in conversation
for your own sake?

01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:38.603
I asked you to tell me about your husband.

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:46.403
- It's like we're strangers now.
- And?

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:52.034
The last time I saw him,
we were so disconnected,

01:28:52.076 --> 01:28:53.410
but now

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:59.916
I'd give anything in the world

01:29:03.546 --> 01:29:05.255
to see my husband.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:08.633
Matrimony's always fascinated me.

01:29:08.718 --> 01:29:11.261
Husbands barely able to look at their wives,

01:29:11.304 --> 01:29:15.599
wives on their backs
in motel rooms with perfect strangers,

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:18.935
people who bear children
only to neglect them.

01:29:18.978 --> 01:29:21.313
"Till death do us part," indeed.

01:29:21.397 --> 01:29:24.775
I don't know what you think you know,

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:27.486
but my marriage
has survived more suffering

01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:30.238
than someone like you could ever grasp.

01:29:30.281 --> 01:29:31.656
Suffering?

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:34.993
You haven't seen anything yet.

01:29:37.246 --> 01:29:39.539
Someone like me? Who am I?

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:40.957
A monster.

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.043
A murderer.

01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:44.669
I don't condone murder,

01:29:44.754 --> 01:29:48.382
and I despise murderers.

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:49.633
Please.

01:29:56.307 --> 01:29:58.850
Please, let me go.

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.568
We're fine, Amanda. We don't need you.

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.741
I said, we're fine.

01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:29.005
If you make it through this, Lynn,

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:31.883
you're going to thank me one day
just as Amanda did.

01:30:39.475 --> 01:30:42.477
Please, let me go.

01:30:43.396 --> 01:30:45.772
I saved your life.

01:30:45.857 --> 01:30:49.317
Maybe my life isn't the one
you were saving after all.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:57.826
Tell me about your daughter.
I understand she's quite a little athlete.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:08.211
- Or we could talk about your son.
- What did you say?

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:16.052
Why are you living with the dead
when you have such a beautiful family?

01:31:16.721 --> 01:31:19.222
A husband who's indeed alone,

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:23.643
a daughter who needs her mother,

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:27.272
patients who need a competent physician
who looks them in the eye

01:31:27.356 --> 01:31:30.192
and treats them like human beings?

01:31:30.234 --> 01:31:32.527
He's completed the third test.

01:31:33.738 --> 01:31:36.531
Congratulations, Lynn. You're free to go.

01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:40.744
Yeah, but he's not all the way out yet.

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:45.415
Undo her collar, Amanda, and let her go.

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:49.419
No, he's not finished. He's not all the way.

01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:53.423
Amanda, Lynn is more important
than you know.

01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:56.635
Unlock her collar, and let her go.

01:31:58.054 --> 01:31:59.429
I said no.

01:32:03.809 --> 01:32:06.686
- Amanda, there are rules.
- I said no!

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:10.941
She doesn't deserve to go free.

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:13.568
- You promised.
- I didn't promise you shit.

01:32:13.611 --> 01:32:15.946
Amanda, even with that gun,

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:21.076
it is Lynn who holds your life in her hands.

01:32:21.118 --> 01:32:25.705
Fuck you. You give her control over me?
Fuck you!

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:28.250
I won't tell anyone. I promise I won't.

01:32:28.292 --> 01:32:29.459
Please, I have a family.

01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:32.295
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.756
And stop fucking moving around!

01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:38.134
And what about the other test subjects
that we left alive?

01:32:38.177 --> 01:32:40.720
- Game over.
- I'll fucking kill you!

01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:44.724
- What about them?
- Is that how you felt about them?

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:49.980
Is that how you felt about Eric Matthews?

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:52.649
- Eric Matthews.
- Oh, my God! Let me go.

01:32:53.192 --> 01:32:56.236
I'll tell you how I felt about Eric Matthews.

01:33:24.724 --> 01:33:27.267
Daniel!

01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:34.190
- Fuck!
- Daniel!

01:33:46.245 --> 01:33:47.454
Daniel?

01:34:17.943 --> 01:34:19.069
Fuck!

01:35:26.762 --> 01:35:28.304
Where's my son?

01:35:30.599 --> 01:35:33.643
- Where is he, you junkie bitch?
- Fuck you.

01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:38.440
Where is he?

01:35:52.163 --> 01:35:54.247
Tell me where he is.

01:35:54.331 --> 01:35:57.250
- Tell me where he is.
- Right fucking here.

01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:17.937
You bitch!

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:24.778
You're nothing, bitch!

01:36:26.864 --> 01:36:28.406
You're nothing!

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:35.705
You're not Jigsaw.

01:36:40.127 --> 01:36:42.670
You're not Jigsaw, bitch!

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:53.556
You hear me?

01:36:54.850 --> 01:36:56.392
You're nothing!

01:36:59.396 --> 01:37:01.439
You're not Jigsaw, bitch.

01:37:04.902 --> 01:37:06.486
You're nothing!

01:37:10.074 --> 01:37:12.742
I'll fucking kill you!

01:37:12.785 --> 01:37:14.118
No!

01:37:14.203 --> 01:37:17.038
That's right. I'm a murderer.

01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:22.877
He took my life from me,
so I just returned the fucking favor.

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.130
No, Amanda, that's what you thought,

01:37:26.215 --> 01:37:28.550
but I know different.

01:37:28.592 --> 01:37:32.762
- You left him for dead, didn't you?
- Just stop fucking with me.

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:38.017
But I cleaned up your mistakes,
and I forgave you for them.

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.688
Let me go! Please!

01:37:42.815 --> 01:37:45.441
What you do is no different than murder.

01:37:45.484 --> 01:37:48.444
You torture people. You watch them die.

01:37:48.487 --> 01:37:51.197
But now you're begging me
not to kill this worthless bitch

01:37:51.282 --> 01:37:52.991
on the grounds of some game?

01:37:53.075 --> 01:37:56.244
You're walking us
toward a precipice, Amanda.

01:37:56.287 --> 01:37:58.663
- Step back.
- It's bullshit.

01:37:58.747 --> 01:38:02.166
Nobody changes. It's all a lie.

01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:04.419
If you fail in this, we all fail.

01:38:04.461 --> 01:38:06.546
Succeed, and we all succeed.

01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:08.006
It's a lie!

01:38:13.762 --> 01:38:16.639
I'll tell you, she hasn't changed

01:38:16.682 --> 01:38:18.975
because nobody fucking changes.

01:38:20.644 --> 01:38:23.771
Nobody is reborn. It's all bullshit!

01:38:23.814 --> 01:38:25.648
It's all a fucking lie,

01:38:25.691 --> 01:38:28.526
and I'm just a pawn in your stupid games.

01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:43.833
I don't mean anything to you.

01:38:43.876 --> 01:38:46.544
No, you mean everything to me.

01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:48.046
Fuck you!

01:38:48.130 --> 01:38:49.923
Our fates are linked.

01:38:51.717 --> 01:38:54.302
I've tried to help you, Amanda.

01:38:54.345 --> 01:38:57.347
So help me! Fix me!

01:38:58.682 --> 01:39:00.516
Fix me, motherfucker!

01:39:01.852 --> 01:39:03.853
I'm standing right here.

01:39:08.692 --> 01:39:11.027
Why is she so important to you?

01:39:12.488 --> 01:39:14.530
She's not important to me.

01:39:15.824 --> 01:39:19.452
- She's important to you.
- She's not important to me.

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:23.706
I beg you to reconsider that.

01:39:29.713 --> 01:39:31.381
This is your last chance, Amanda.

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:32.966
She's nothing.

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:51.901
Your time's running out.

01:39:54.697 --> 01:39:57.073
Now, you think about what you're doing.

01:40:00.536 --> 01:40:03.287
Think about everything that you've done.

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:13.131
You think about what you promised me.

01:40:13.215 --> 01:40:15.133
Think about our dreams.

01:40:16.301 --> 01:40:18.136
You think about tomorrow.

01:40:20.764 --> 01:40:21.889
Lynn?

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:23.766
Jeff! Jeff!

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:29.897
Lynn.

01:40:30.441 --> 01:40:31.899
- Lynn.
- Jeff.

01:40:32.735 --> 01:40:34.986
You just destroyed four lives.

01:40:35.612 --> 01:40:37.697
You just murdered Jeff's wife.

01:40:57.801 --> 01:40:58.885
Baby.

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:00.762
Amanda.

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:04.766
It's okay.

01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:12.315
This was your test,

01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:15.610
your game.

01:41:17.154 --> 01:41:18.571
What do I want?

01:41:18.655 --> 01:41:20.031
I want to play a game.

01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:25.161
You're being tested.
Your will is being tested,

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:29.916
your will to keep someone alive.
Can you do that? Can you follow the rules

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.335
and grant someone the gift of life?

01:41:34.546 --> 01:41:37.548
I was testing you. I took you in.

01:41:38.342 --> 01:41:39.842
You will give everything to me.

01:41:39.885 --> 01:41:41.177
Yes.

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:42.553
Every cell in your body.

01:41:42.638 --> 01:41:47.683
<i>I selected you for the honor
of carrying on my life's work,</i>

01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:49.727
<i>but you didn't.</i>

01:41:49.812 --> 01:41:51.062
That's right.

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:53.481
I'm a murderer.

01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:55.316
I despise murderers.

01:41:55.359 --> 01:41:57.276
You didn't test anyone's will to live.

01:41:57.361 --> 01:41:58.694
Game over.

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:02.615
<i>Instead you took away their only chance.</i>

01:42:02.699 --> 01:42:04.826
<i>Your games were unwinnable,</i>

01:42:05.536 --> 01:42:07.495
<i>your subjects, merely victims.</i>

01:42:07.538 --> 01:42:08.913
You.

01:42:09.873 --> 01:42:13.042
There is no turning back.
Do you understand that?

01:42:13.085 --> 01:42:18.631
<i>In my desperation,
I decided to give you one last chance,</i>

01:42:18.715 --> 01:42:21.551
<i>so I put everything in place.</i>

01:42:22.719 --> 01:42:24.679
You chose her 'cause she's the best, right?

01:42:24.721 --> 01:42:26.097
That's one reason I chose her.

01:42:26.181 --> 01:42:30.560
<i>You didn't know that Lynn and Jeff
were husband and wife.</i>

01:42:31.353 --> 01:42:35.731
I had to keep that from you
for the purposes of my game.

01:42:35.774 --> 01:42:38.234
<i>I had to leave out the ruined marriage,</i>

01:42:38.277 --> 01:42:40.486
<i>the cheating wife,</i>

01:42:41.530 --> 01:42:45.825
<i>the vengeful husband,
the neglected daughter,</i>

01:42:46.451 --> 01:42:49.996
<i>and I let you make your own choices.</i>

01:42:51.915 --> 01:42:54.167
I wanted you to succeed.

01:42:55.085 --> 01:42:56.127
Amanda.

01:42:56.211 --> 01:42:57.920
Put it away.

01:42:58.005 --> 01:42:59.046
Trust me.

01:42:59.089 --> 01:43:00.256
Even with that gun,

01:43:00.299 --> 01:43:03.759
it is Lynn who holds your life in her hands.

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:05.595
She's not important to me.

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:08.306
I beg you to reconsider that.

01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:10.433
Unlock her collar, and let her go.

01:43:10.517 --> 01:43:11.684
I said no.

01:43:12.436 --> 01:43:15.104
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:17.607
You need to abide by those rules.

01:43:19.568 --> 01:43:21.027
You couldn't.

01:43:26.533 --> 01:43:28.159
God.

01:43:44.468 --> 01:43:45.843
Game over.

01:43:57.856 --> 01:44:00.233
You haven't learned anything tonight,
have you?

01:44:00.317 --> 01:44:04.153
Your rage and your vengeance
will only hurt the ones you love.

01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:07.657
Killing me will only add to your misery.

01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:10.785
It will not bring back your son.

01:44:10.827 --> 01:44:12.828
Think of your daughter, Jeff.

01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:15.331
She needs you now more than ever.

01:44:16.959 --> 01:44:18.960
You can't kill me, Jeff.

01:44:28.845 --> 01:44:30.846
Your wife's dying, Jeff.

01:44:32.015 --> 01:44:33.975
Her time's running out.

01:44:42.025 --> 01:44:45.736
Jeff, do not miscalculate.

01:44:45.821 --> 01:44:47.697
Your fate is in my hands.

01:44:47.739 --> 01:44:50.700
Your wife's fate is in my hands.

01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:54.704
I love you.

01:44:58.542 --> 01:45:00.584
I'm taking you home, okay?

01:45:01.336 --> 01:45:04.422
Though you may not see any threat,

01:45:04.506 --> 01:45:07.258
there are threats all around you.

01:45:07.342 --> 01:45:10.011
Jeff, if you try to move your wife,
she will die.

01:45:10.053 --> 01:45:13.180
I can have an ambulance here
in four minutes.

01:45:13.223 --> 01:45:15.766
Would you like to take your wife
out of here tonight?

01:45:15.851 --> 01:45:17.601
Would you like to take her to safety?

01:45:17.686 --> 01:45:19.729
- Stay.
- Stand and face me, Jeff.

01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:22.231
- Stay with me, please.
- Right now.

01:45:23.775 --> 01:45:28.070
Would you like to get your life back?
Would you, Jeff?

01:45:28.113 --> 01:45:30.072
We can make that happen.

01:45:32.242 --> 01:45:33.909
Which is it, Jeff?

01:45:33.952 --> 01:45:36.620
Come on, yes or no?

01:45:36.705 --> 01:45:37.747
Yes.

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:43.753
- What do you want?
- One final test.

01:45:43.795 --> 01:45:45.254
The rules are simple.

01:45:45.339 --> 01:45:49.675
Over on that table,
there's a host of vicious implements,

01:45:51.762 --> 01:45:54.847
which you can use
to exact your pound of flesh,

01:45:54.931 --> 01:45:56.515
to take your vengeance,

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:59.435
to indulge your obsession,

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:05.107
or you can choose
to put your vengeance aside,

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:06.942
and you can forgive.

01:46:08.737 --> 01:46:14.700
You can forgive me for the pain
that I've caused you and your wife tonight.

01:46:15.952 --> 01:46:19.622
- Jeff.
- Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:25.878
Honey, don't do it.

01:46:25.962 --> 01:46:27.129
Jeff...

01:46:29.758 --> 01:46:31.384
It's up to you.

01:46:31.468 --> 01:46:33.928
- I need you.
- Live or die, Jeff?

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.306
Make our choice.

01:46:55.075 --> 01:46:56.617
I forgive you.

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:04.708
Jeff...

01:47:05.627 --> 01:47:07.711
Jeff. Jeff!

01:47:17.431 --> 01:47:18.681
Jeff, no.

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:34.613
I forgive you.

01:47:47.043 --> 01:47:48.544
<i>Hello, Jeff.</i>

01:47:48.628 --> 01:47:53.549
<i>I made this tape as an insurance policy,
if you will.</i>

01:47:53.633 --> 01:47:54.717
Jeff!

01:47:56.219 --> 01:48:00.181
<i>And if you're listening to it,
then it's time to collect.</i>

01:48:02.601 --> 01:48:05.895
<i>I was your final test of forgiveness,</i>

01:48:05.937 --> 01:48:09.148
<i>and if you are listening to this,
then you failed.</i>

01:48:11.067 --> 01:48:14.069
<i>Now you must pay the price,</i>

01:48:14.112 --> 01:48:17.072
<i>the price for living for nothing
but vengeance.</i>

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:20.743
<i>Now I will give you something to live for.</i>

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:24.079
<i>I told you that you couldn't kill me, Jeff,</i>

01:48:24.164 --> 01:48:26.290
<i>but I didn't tell you why,</i>

01:48:26.374 --> 01:48:28.000
<i>and the answer is simple.</i>

01:48:28.084 --> 01:48:31.962
<i>I am the person responsible
for the loss of your child.</i>

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:38.093
<i>I am the only person
who knows where your daughter is.</i>

01:48:38.803 --> 01:48:41.889
<i>She only has a limited supply of air, Jeff,</i>

01:48:41.932 --> 01:48:43.724
<i>and if you want to get her back,</i>

01:48:43.767 --> 01:48:45.893
<i>you'll have to play a game.</i>

01:48:51.733 --> 01:48:53.067
Jeff!

01:48:54.305 --> 01:49:00.199
