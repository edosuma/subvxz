00:00.412 --> 00:02.159
<i>Previously
on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.713 --> 00:05.515
The chefs got an early start

00:05.582 --> 00:07.150
on a monumental task.

00:07.217 --> 00:09.552
Hell's Kitchen
will feature menus

00:09.619 --> 00:12.588
designed and executed
by all of you.

00:12.656 --> 00:14.590
The blue team's
successful creations...

00:14.658 --> 00:15.823
Nice.
It's delicious.

00:15.891 --> 00:16.991
Were a pleasant surprise.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.793
Really? The blue team?
Are you sure?

00:18.861 --> 00:21.163
But the women delivered
some surprises of their own.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.298
What are you thinking?
That is hideous.

00:23.366 --> 00:24.366
At dinner, Jon...

00:24.434 --> 00:25.333
Two beets coming right up.

00:25.401 --> 00:26.268
And Michael...

00:26.335 --> 00:27.469
I'm walking.

00:27.537 --> 00:28.236
Impressed on appetizers.

00:28.304 --> 00:30.072
Service, please.

00:30.139 --> 00:31.905
While in the red
kitchen, Nedra's silence...

00:31.973 --> 00:33.107
Open up!

00:33.175 --> 00:35.109
She is not communicating
with anyone.

00:35.177 --> 00:36.810
Got the women
off to a slow start.

00:36.878 --> 00:38.512
Why is the fish not in?
Why is it not in?

00:38.580 --> 00:39.313
But when
it came to entrees...

00:39.381 --> 00:40.414
It's not even warm!

00:40.482 --> 00:41.382
Michael...

00:41.450 --> 00:42.450
raw halibut.

00:42.517 --> 00:43.451
Oh.

00:43.518 --> 00:44.685
Dry, stringy, and mushy.

00:44.752 --> 00:45.953
Got a time-out.

00:46.020 --> 00:47.620
Five minutes.
off in the back.

00:49.256 --> 00:50.290
And Zach...

00:50.357 --> 00:51.458
You've just gone to sleep!

00:51.525 --> 00:52.692
Got told off.

00:52.759 --> 00:53.859
You them,
and you me!

00:53.927 --> 00:54.927
The women...

00:54.995 --> 00:55.995
I can slice on the New York?

00:56.063 --> 00:57.663
Yes, I'm walking right now.

00:57.731 --> 00:59.732
Somehow came
together and won the night.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.367
Such an amazing feeling.

01:01.435 --> 01:03.168
But there was
still more work to do.

01:03.236 --> 01:06.105
Decide which individual
will be joining the blue team.

01:06.172 --> 01:07.272
I wanna go.
I was thinking the same thing.

01:07.340 --> 01:09.108
I was thinking the same thing.

01:09.175 --> 01:11.276
While the women debated
who would join the blue team,

01:11.344 --> 01:12.877
the men...
You lost, guys.

01:12.945 --> 01:15.214
Come up with the one individual
that you want out.

01:15.281 --> 01:16.482
Debated who to lose.

01:16.549 --> 01:17.483
You better not say
my name

01:17.550 --> 01:18.584
out your mouth, you.

01:18.651 --> 01:20.151
Dude!

01:20.219 --> 01:21.852
With the men...
Blue team's nominee.

01:21.920 --> 01:22.987
Zach.
Chef Mike.

01:23.054 --> 01:24.322
Michael.
I chose Zach.

01:24.389 --> 01:26.257
Unable to make a decision,

01:26.325 --> 01:27.791
chef Ramsay was left to choose.

01:27.859 --> 01:29.494
Michael.

01:29.561 --> 01:31.829
This was a dreadful service
for you.

01:31.896 --> 01:33.764
It was Michael
who lost his chance

01:33.832 --> 01:35.999
to become head chef
at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill

01:36.066 --> 01:37.571
at Caesars Palace...

01:39.970 --> 01:42.439
But there was still one question
left to be answered.

01:42.507 --> 01:45.575
Who volunteers to go
over to the men's team?

01:45.643 --> 01:47.511
We drew a name out of a pot.

01:47.578 --> 01:49.746
We're not playing
roulette for a restaurant here.

01:49.813 --> 01:51.347
All of you.

01:51.414 --> 01:53.282

03:03.916 --> 03:08.052
All of you, head back
to the red kitchen

03:08.120 --> 03:10.589
and spend two minutes
and decide amongst you.

03:10.656 --> 03:12.155
<i>Hurry up!</i>

03:12.224 --> 03:13.790
<i>I didn't ask you to stick it

03:13.858 --> 03:15.426
like some game show.

03:15.493 --> 03:16.893
<i>What is this?</i>

03:16.961 --> 03:19.296
I don't wanna go over there now,
not with Zach.

03:19.364 --> 03:20.664
I don't really wanna work
with Zach either.

03:20.732 --> 03:24.101
I was certain
that Zach was going home,

03:24.168 --> 03:26.770
but now that I know
that he's still here,

03:26.838 --> 03:29.672
I, for sure, do not want to go
to the blue team.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.140
Who still wants to go?

03:31.208 --> 03:33.042
Do you still wanna go?

03:33.110 --> 03:34.277
I'll go.

03:34.345 --> 03:36.279
I don't mind going
to the blue team.

03:36.347 --> 03:37.547
I'm going for a strategy move.

03:37.615 --> 03:40.149
Either we gonna step up,
or we're not.

03:40.217 --> 03:42.619
I just gotta grab the bull
by the horns

03:42.686 --> 03:44.819
and drive home a black jacket,
so I can be the executive chef.

03:44.887 --> 03:46.488
I'll go.
All right.

03:46.556 --> 03:48.423
You'll bust their asses.
All right.

03:48.491 --> 03:51.926
Let's go, ladies.

03:51.994 --> 03:56.565
Susan, which member will be
moving over to the blue team?

03:56.633 --> 03:58.900
Nedra.

03:58.968 --> 04:01.168
Well, Nedra,
your wish is granted.

04:01.236 --> 04:03.371
<i>Come over here, please.</i>

04:03.438 --> 04:04.572
Mm-hmm.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.906
Red team, tell me the truth.

04:05.974 --> 04:06.974
You wanted to get rid of her,

04:07.041 --> 04:08.376
and you couldn't eliminate her,

04:08.443 --> 04:12.680
so you did the next best thing,
and you sent her to us.

04:12.748 --> 04:14.181
Welcome to the blue side.

04:14.249 --> 04:15.715
Nedra.
Yes, chef?

04:15.783 --> 04:17.183
Help the blue team,

04:17.250 --> 04:19.351
'cause right now,
they're in need of it.

04:19.420 --> 04:20.553
Yes, chef.

04:20.620 --> 04:21.721
Good night.

04:21.789 --> 04:24.023
Good night, chef.

04:24.091 --> 04:26.559
Well, Nedra, welcome
to the "blue-sers."

04:27.995 --> 04:29.095
Not for long.

04:29.163 --> 04:30.563
Yeah, heard that, right?

04:30.631 --> 04:31.730
I hate to lose.

04:31.798 --> 04:33.465
I'm not doing no punishments.

04:33.533 --> 04:36.602
I ain't liftin',
I ain't eatin' nothin' nasty,

04:36.670 --> 04:38.136
so they better get it together.

04:38.204 --> 04:39.871
I got this blue jacket on now,

04:39.939 --> 04:43.008
but it's just a stepping stone
to get to my black jacket.

04:45.111 --> 04:48.045
After a stressful
evening and a team shake-up,

04:48.113 --> 04:51.616
the chefs are up early
and ready to do battle.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.219
Ooh, presents.

04:55.287 --> 04:57.422
<i>Oh!</i>

04:57.489 --> 04:58.856
We like that.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.625
I love presents.

05:00.693 --> 05:03.194
You're all probably wondering
what's inside

05:03.261 --> 05:05.662
those gift boxes
scattered around.

05:05.730 --> 05:06.963
Yes, chef.

05:07.031 --> 05:09.165
I'll explain
a little more later.

05:09.233 --> 05:10.500
<i>Right.</i>

05:10.568 --> 05:12.803
Every day, I think
how fortunate I am

05:12.870 --> 05:14.304
to be a chef in this era.

05:14.372 --> 05:17.474
Today's chef is much more
international than ever before,

05:17.542 --> 05:19.175
and that is what

05:19.243 --> 05:21.677
your next challenge
is all about.

05:21.745 --> 05:23.612
You'll be tested
on your creativity

05:23.680 --> 05:26.615
with international cuisine

05:26.683 --> 05:30.219
from a variety of countries.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.387
Oh, my God.

05:31.455 --> 05:32.655
<i>Wow.</i>

05:32.723 --> 05:33.789
Wow.
Wow, wow.

05:33.857 --> 05:35.490
Wow, these are,
like, supermodels

05:35.558 --> 05:37.325
dressed up in,
you know, international,

05:37.393 --> 05:39.093
you know,
dress from the country.

05:39.161 --> 05:41.062
I mean, there are
so many countries.

05:41.129 --> 05:43.064
France, Italy, Spain,
on and on and on.

05:43.131 --> 05:44.499
Cool.

05:44.567 --> 05:45.933
That's a prize in itself
right here.

05:46.001 --> 05:46.934
Wow.

05:47.002 --> 05:48.169
Okay, excited?

05:48.237 --> 05:49.237
Yes, chef.

05:49.304 --> 05:51.372
Good, you'll each be working

05:51.439 --> 05:53.774
on one
of these amazing cuisines.

05:53.842 --> 05:55.175
Yes, chef.

05:55.243 --> 05:56.577
Trust me, you're not going
to decide

05:56.644 --> 05:59.179
<i>which cuisine
you'll be working with.</i>

05:59.247 --> 06:00.581
It's not that easy, chef.
It never is.

06:00.648 --> 06:02.416
No.

06:02.484 --> 06:04.284
<i>This is how
you're gonna decide.</i>

06:04.352 --> 06:05.986
Oh.

06:06.053 --> 06:07.520
Yes.
Hey.

06:07.588 --> 06:09.221
Thank you, Andi.
Thank you, James.

06:09.289 --> 06:10.556
<i>Awesome.
Okay, Mary.</i>

06:10.624 --> 06:12.592
Who would you like
to do battle with

06:12.659 --> 06:14.126
on the blue team?

06:14.194 --> 06:15.795
I think I'd like
to go up against Jon.

06:15.863 --> 06:18.097
Jon is the best person
on the blue team,

06:18.164 --> 06:19.665
and it would be very satisfying

06:19.733 --> 06:22.802
to just beat the crap
out of him in the challenge.

06:22.870 --> 06:24.703
Mary and Jon, please.
Sure.

06:24.771 --> 06:28.206
Come down.
Mary, spin the wheel, please.

06:28.274 --> 06:30.141
<i>I feel like we're
on The Price is Right.</i>

06:30.209 --> 06:32.143
Go, Mary!

06:32.211 --> 06:36.915
Okay, Mary and Jon,
you're gonna be cooking...

06:36.982 --> 06:39.050
Wow.

06:39.118 --> 06:40.518
<i>Indian cuisine.</i>

06:40.585 --> 06:41.886
Yes.

06:41.953 --> 06:42.820
I've cooked a lot
of Indian food before,

06:42.888 --> 06:45.723
so I'm thinking, "Dude, I can
knock this one out of the park."

06:45.791 --> 06:46.824
Please, my darling,
reveal the box.

06:46.892 --> 06:47.792
<i>Thank you.
Wow.</i>

06:47.859 --> 06:48.793
<i>Oh, nice.</i>

06:48.860 --> 06:50.127
<i>Oh, cool.</i>

06:50.194 --> 06:51.595
<i>Now, there's the ingredients</i>

06:51.663 --> 06:54.899
<i>you will cook with
in your next challenge, okay?</i>

06:54.966 --> 06:58.134
Nedra, who on the red team

06:58.201 --> 06:59.368
would you like to take on?

06:59.437 --> 07:01.638
I pick...

07:01.705 --> 07:03.372
Ja'nel.

07:03.441 --> 07:04.874
Yeah, I picked you, bitch.

07:04.942 --> 07:07.677
Spin the wheel.
Let's go.

07:07.745 --> 07:08.845
Nice.

07:13.149 --> 07:13.982
<i>Thai.</i>

07:14.050 --> 07:15.317
Oh, my God.

07:15.384 --> 07:18.053
I ain't never cooked Thai
a day in my life.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.722
<i>And there are
your amazing ingredients.</i>

07:20.790 --> 07:22.190
<i>Wow.</i>

07:22.258 --> 07:24.460
I don't eat
I don't know how to pronounce.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.228
I'ma try to do
somethin' good, somethin'.

07:27.296 --> 07:29.163
Okay.
Susan.

07:29.230 --> 07:30.698
I'd like to go
against Zach, chef.

07:30.766 --> 07:31.866
<i>Zach.</i>

07:31.934 --> 07:33.067
What the
is Susan thinking?

07:33.134 --> 07:36.236
I'ma beat the brakes
off her ass.

07:36.304 --> 07:39.774
You'll both be working with...

07:39.842 --> 07:43.277
Japanese cuisine with
the most amazing ingredients.

07:43.345 --> 07:44.911
I love Japanese food,

07:44.979 --> 07:46.446
and I'm absolutely
gonna beat Zach.

07:46.514 --> 07:49.616
<i>Ah, Konichiwa.</i>

07:49.684 --> 07:53.086
Cyndi and Anthony, let's go.

07:56.591 --> 07:58.024
Greek cuisine.

07:58.092 --> 07:59.158
I am stoked.

07:59.226 --> 08:01.226
I love Greek.
I can work with Greek.

08:01.294 --> 08:04.429
Olives, feta, mint,
I love these ingredients.

08:04.498 --> 08:05.798
Join me in giving a big hand

08:05.866 --> 08:07.900
for our very glamorous,
beautiful ladies.

08:07.968 --> 08:09.869
Thank you so much. Great job.
Thank you, ladies.

08:09.936 --> 08:11.436
<i>Thank you for
joining us for today.</i>

08:11.505 --> 08:12.805
<i>Best wishes.
Excited?</i>

08:12.873 --> 08:14.039
<i>Listen up.
Yes, chef.</i>

08:14.107 --> 08:15.907
Now, your proteins
are in the kitchen,

08:15.975 --> 08:18.910
but everything else
is on these tables.

08:18.978 --> 08:21.178
You've all got 45 minutes

08:21.246 --> 08:23.748
to create
a stunning ethnic dish.

08:23.816 --> 08:26.551
On your mark.
Get set.

08:26.619 --> 08:28.085
Go.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.587
For this
challenge, each chef

08:29.622 --> 08:30.989
will be tested on their ability

08:31.056 --> 08:34.190
to create a stunning
and delicious ethnic dish.

08:34.225 --> 08:36.259
They're only permitted
to use the ingredients

08:36.327 --> 08:38.695
that are on the table
of the country they landed on.

08:38.763 --> 08:40.230
Nedr, what are you working?

08:40.297 --> 08:42.298
I'm gonna do a calamari.
I'ma deep fry it.

08:42.366 --> 08:45.301
I'm nervous as hell,
but I'm fast on my feet.

08:45.369 --> 08:47.837
I think we're gonna do
good.

08:47.905 --> 08:49.539
So I'm pull something
out of my.

08:49.606 --> 08:51.507
You guys need a win.

08:51.575 --> 08:52.374
I think you guys got it in you.

08:52.442 --> 08:54.243
You're part of us now,

08:54.310 --> 08:55.277
so it's not "You guys."
It's "We need to win."

08:55.345 --> 08:57.747
Oh. Us.

08:57.814 --> 08:59.549
There are so many things
I wanna do with Japan.

08:59.616 --> 09:02.084
Japanese cuisine, you can really
go a million different ways.

09:02.185 --> 09:03.752
I'm not exactly sure
what I wanna do.

09:03.819 --> 09:06.788
I just don't know what...
how I wanna do this.

09:06.856 --> 09:08.423
Do sesame-crusted
seared ahi

09:08.490 --> 09:10.625
or maybe a sauteed bok choy.

09:10.693 --> 09:12.427
Oh, I can do a daikon salad.

09:12.494 --> 09:14.695
I don't even
wanna make rice, like...

09:14.763 --> 09:16.897
I might as well have some rice.

09:16.965 --> 09:18.832
Suse, just pick one direction
and go.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.333
Susan is all over the place...

09:20.401 --> 09:21.735
Does anybody know
how to use a rice cooker?

09:21.803 --> 09:22.803
I don't use a rice cooker.

09:22.871 --> 09:24.872
Trying to get rice working.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.506
She is looking
at the rice cooker

09:26.575 --> 09:27.908
like it's R2-D2.

09:29.177 --> 09:30.043
Is it cooking?
I can't...

09:31.745 --> 09:34.213
While Susan is
stumped by a rice cooker,

09:34.281 --> 09:36.182
over in the blue kitchen,
Zach...

09:36.249 --> 09:37.684
This is definitely me
outside the box.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.485
We'll see what I come up with.

09:39.553 --> 09:42.088
Refuses to let Japanese
cuisine get the best of him.

09:42.155 --> 09:45.657
I'm doing some type of pasta
with the Asian veggies.

09:45.725 --> 09:47.025
I wasn't hoping
for this, though.

09:47.093 --> 09:49.360
Never cooked Japanese cuisine
in my life...

09:49.428 --> 09:51.029
I gotta get
that soy sauce.

09:51.097 --> 09:52.664
But I know good taste.

09:52.732 --> 09:55.033
I know good flavors.
I know the vegetables.

09:55.101 --> 09:58.136
Bok chewy and, you know, uh,

09:58.204 --> 09:59.771
mushrooms and like that.

09:59.839 --> 10:01.573
Do you know what kind
of herb this is?

10:01.640 --> 10:03.674
Fresh herb.
it, let's rock.

10:03.742 --> 10:05.409
I ain't gonna get caught up
with labels.

10:05.477 --> 10:07.745
Japanese food
is like Chinese food,

10:07.813 --> 10:09.046
and the only reason I know that

10:09.114 --> 10:12.516
because my one Korean friend
told me this.

10:12.584 --> 10:14.986
Ooh, I can smell them flavors
breaking out.

10:15.053 --> 10:16.153
Eight minutes to go.

10:16.221 --> 10:18.354
I was gonna do,
like, a creamy yogurt

10:18.422 --> 10:20.323
and maybe some chunks of lamb.

10:20.390 --> 10:22.225
What's that burning smell?

10:22.292 --> 10:23.259
Cripes.
I burned my rice.

10:23.327 --> 10:24.728
Like, 100% burned.

10:24.795 --> 10:26.863
This totally throws me
for a loop.

10:26.931 --> 10:29.599
One of my, you know,
key components is burnt,

10:29.667 --> 10:30.634
and I need it.

10:30.701 --> 10:31.935
Sorry, guys.

10:32.003 --> 10:33.736
Push to the last minute, Mary,
the last minute.

10:33.803 --> 10:35.904
90 seconds to go.

10:35.972 --> 10:37.139
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go.</i>

10:37.206 --> 10:38.140
<i>We should be looking at plates.</i>

10:38.207 --> 10:39.441
You know what?

10:39.509 --> 10:40.943
This chicken's
cooked perfect.

10:41.011 --> 10:43.178
20 seconds to go.
20 seconds heard.

10:43.246 --> 10:44.613
<i>Yes, chef.
Come on, ladies.</i>

10:44.681 --> 10:46.481
Everyone's plating?
Everyone's almost ready?

10:46.549 --> 10:48.283
Cripes.
Ten, nine,

10:48.351 --> 10:50.251
<i>eight, seven...
Yep, I'm plating.</i>

10:50.318 --> 10:52.353
<i>Six, five,</i>

10:52.420 --> 10:54.421
four, three,

10:54.489 --> 10:56.323
<i>two, one,</i>

10:56.391 --> 10:58.760
<i>and serve.</i>

10:58.827 --> 11:00.561
Okay.

11:00.629 --> 11:03.665
To judge this challenge,
I have brought in

11:03.732 --> 11:07.300
one of the most respected
food writers across America.

11:07.368 --> 11:09.936
She's currently
the executive editor

11:10.004 --> 11:12.205
at one
of the most popular magazines

11:12.273 --> 11:14.240
<i>anywhere in the world,
Every Day with Rachael Ray.</i>

11:14.308 --> 11:15.742
Wow.

11:15.810 --> 11:19.479
Please say hello
to my friend Dana Bowen.

11:19.547 --> 11:21.648
<i>Hello, my darling.
Hey.</i>

11:21.715 --> 11:25.317
This woman knows her food
inside and out

11:25.385 --> 11:26.418
and around the world.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.653
It was a little intimidating.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.088
Thank you for having me.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.890
I'm excited about this challenge.
Brilliant.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.992
Let's start off
with Indian cuisine, shall we?

11:33.060 --> 11:34.359
Indian, great.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.896
Mary and Jon, please.

11:39.098 --> 11:42.133
Mary. Today, I did a
pan-seeded lamb loin.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.002
<i>It's crusted with garam masala.</i>

11:44.070 --> 11:48.039
Underneath,
it's grilled eggplant puree.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.340
I'm looking at my plate,

11:49.408 --> 11:51.509
and I'm wishing that I had
my basmati rice.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.744
For me, it's just missing that
right now.

11:53.812 --> 11:55.713
I'm really nervous.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.314
It's... it's...
it's beautifully done.

11:57.381 --> 11:58.882
<i>The spices
are not overwhelming.</i>

11:58.950 --> 12:00.117
Lamb's delicious.

12:00.185 --> 12:02.086
It really is so tender.
It's great.

12:02.153 --> 12:03.320
Oh, my gosh.
They love it.

12:03.387 --> 12:06.857
Maybe rice is overrated.

12:06.925 --> 12:08.158
Jon, please.

12:08.226 --> 12:10.727
So here, I kinda did a take
on a tandoori chicken.

12:10.794 --> 12:13.295
You got honey raita
with some pistachios in it.

12:13.363 --> 12:14.697
<i>Made the chicken
a little spicier,</i>

12:14.765 --> 12:17.800
and then I glazed it
with some honey at the end.

12:17.868 --> 12:20.236
Mm, very tender.
That's very nice.

12:20.303 --> 12:22.004
Yeah, that was delicious.

12:22.072 --> 12:23.206
<i>What I love
about this dish...</i>

12:23.273 --> 12:25.907
it instantly says,
"Indian cuisine."

12:25.975 --> 12:28.043
Um, it could go red team,
blue team.

12:28.111 --> 12:32.047
I have to say I think they both
have strong points to them.

12:32.115 --> 12:34.382
Um, but I'm going to have to go
with the tandoori chicken.

12:34.450 --> 12:35.283
<i>Blue team, well done.</i>

12:35.351 --> 12:36.351
Good job.
Thank you.

12:36.418 --> 12:37.219
<i>Good job.
Good start.</i>

12:39.122 --> 12:40.622
We couldn't at least get a tie?

12:40.689 --> 12:43.791
Uh, one point for blue.
Next, Thai cuisine.

12:43.859 --> 12:45.459
With the
victory-deprived blue team

12:45.526 --> 12:48.328
taking an early lead,
it's now time for Nedra

12:48.396 --> 12:51.832
to face her old teammate
and Nemesis Ja'nel.

12:51.900 --> 12:52.933
Nedra, please.

12:53.001 --> 12:56.003
I have here a nice curry broth

12:56.071 --> 12:57.504
and some deep-fried calamari.

12:57.572 --> 13:00.506
Fried calamari, don't see
a lot of in Thailand.

13:00.574 --> 13:04.477
I wanted to do just something
out of the box.

13:04.544 --> 13:05.945
Calamari is nicely cooked,

13:06.013 --> 13:09.582
but I'm not getting a lot
of herbs or other flavors.

13:09.650 --> 13:11.785
This is very highly seasoned.

13:11.852 --> 13:13.286
Flavors haven't been
cooked out.

13:13.353 --> 13:15.154
Never cooked Thai before, so...

13:15.221 --> 13:15.954
<i>Okay.</i>

13:16.022 --> 13:17.189
Ja'nel, please.

13:17.257 --> 13:19.291
I wanted to do
just a nice steamed halibut.

13:19.358 --> 13:21.059
I made
a lemongrass-coconut broth.

13:21.127 --> 13:22.460
Well, that's just gorgeous.

13:22.528 --> 13:26.498
This is a smart reinterpretation
of a Thai classic dish.

13:26.565 --> 13:28.600
Really?

13:28.668 --> 13:30.334
That's fantastic.

13:30.402 --> 13:32.103
Really?
Like, really?

13:32.171 --> 13:33.437
It's got that vibrance to it.

13:33.505 --> 13:34.571
What?

13:34.639 --> 13:36.440
And... and what's...
let me just...

13:36.508 --> 13:37.308
<i>Mmm, that's delicious.</i>

13:37.375 --> 13:38.676
Come on.

13:38.743 --> 13:41.478
The fish is soaking up
the flavors of the coconut milk.

13:41.546 --> 13:42.814
<i>I just think
this is remarkable.</i>

13:42.881 --> 13:43.915
Like, seriously?

13:43.982 --> 13:45.049
Red team or blue team?

13:45.117 --> 13:46.482
I'm gonna have to say red team.

13:46.550 --> 13:47.818
What the?
Really?

13:47.885 --> 13:49.119
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:49.187 --> 13:49.953
<i>Good job, Ja'nel.
Good job, Nedra.</i>

13:50.021 --> 13:52.055
Ja'nel, great job.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.356
And what I also appreciated
about that dish is...

13:53.424 --> 13:54.624
is you knew when to stop...

13:54.692 --> 13:56.293
<i>Yes.
When not to add more to it.</i>

13:56.360 --> 13:57.861
I think you did
a beautiful job.

13:57.929 --> 13:59.996
Okay, whatever.

14:00.064 --> 14:01.631
Thank you.

14:01.699 --> 14:02.898
Next up.

14:02.999 --> 14:05.034
With Ja'nel outclassing Nedra,

14:05.101 --> 14:06.802
the score is all tied up.

14:06.870 --> 14:09.071
Now, it's time to see
who will win...

14:09.139 --> 14:10.605
The battle of Greece.
Let's go.

14:10.673 --> 14:12.107
Anthony or Cyndi.

14:12.175 --> 14:13.442
Cyndi, please,
present your dish.

14:13.509 --> 14:16.212
Today, I prepared
a stuffed chicken roulade

14:16.279 --> 14:19.047
and an orzo salad with mint.

14:19.114 --> 14:20.014
Mmm.
Wow.

14:20.082 --> 14:21.115
This is delicious.

14:21.183 --> 14:24.085
The chicken
is very well-done.

14:24.153 --> 14:25.220
It's seasoned beautifully.
Thank you.

14:25.287 --> 14:26.254
Anthony, please.

14:26.322 --> 14:28.156
I have a seared lamb.

14:28.224 --> 14:30.591
The sauce underneath
is a plain Greek yogurt

14:30.659 --> 14:34.094
with plum and mint.

14:34.162 --> 14:35.229
Nicely cooked.

14:35.296 --> 14:37.797
Yeah.
That lamb is like butter.

14:37.866 --> 14:39.666
The plum is... is...
is sort of muddying

14:39.734 --> 14:41.969
<i>the flavors a little bit.</i>

14:42.036 --> 14:43.036
<i>The red team or the blue team?</i>

14:43.104 --> 14:44.738
I have to say red team.

14:44.805 --> 14:45.873
<i>Thank you. Red team.</i>

14:45.940 --> 14:47.040
<i>Uh, Cyndi, good job.</i>

14:47.108 --> 14:48.342
<i>Thanks, chef.
Really good job.</i>

14:48.409 --> 14:52.544
Yes! Two to one.
We've got this in the bag.

14:52.612 --> 14:54.713
Last pairing, Japanese cuisine.

14:54.781 --> 14:55.848
It's the final round,

14:55.916 --> 14:57.449
and with the women up by one,

14:57.517 --> 15:00.386
Zach will need to defeat Susan
to force a tie.

15:00.453 --> 15:01.687
Susan, please.

15:01.755 --> 15:04.590
I have prepared
a white miso dashi

15:04.657 --> 15:07.058
with sauteed baby bok choy,

15:07.126 --> 15:09.227
a sesame-seed-crusted
seared ahi

15:09.295 --> 15:12.197
<i>with a ponzu daikon salad
on top.</i>

15:15.067 --> 15:17.702
It's very...

15:17.770 --> 15:19.104
That's fantastic.

15:19.171 --> 15:19.971
<i>That's a very good dish.</i>

15:20.039 --> 15:21.172
Thank you, chef.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.307
It really does harmonize
on the palette.

15:23.375 --> 15:24.141
<i>Great job.
Thank you.</i>

15:24.209 --> 15:26.676
They love my dish.

15:26.744 --> 15:30.714
There is no way
Zach is going to beat me.

15:30.782 --> 15:32.816
This is exactly
why I called you out, Zach.

15:32.884 --> 15:34.251
Okay, Zach.

15:34.319 --> 15:36.053
Zach, you either tie up,

15:36.121 --> 15:37.687
or we lose right now.

15:37.755 --> 15:39.655
It's all up to you.

15:39.723 --> 15:44.093
Um, this is a Japanese noodle
pan-seared chicken,

15:44.161 --> 15:47.230
fresh napa cabbage, bok chewy.

15:53.187 --> 15:54.354
It's the final round

15:54.421 --> 15:55.656
of the international
cuisine challenge,

15:55.723 --> 15:57.723
and the red team is up by one.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.625
Susan's dish has already
been well-received...

15:59.693 --> 16:01.027
That's fantastic.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.094
<i>That's a very good dish.</i>

16:02.162 --> 16:03.763
Thank you, chef.

16:03.830 --> 16:04.964
And so the pressure's on Zach

16:05.032 --> 16:06.365
and his Japanese creation

16:06.432 --> 16:08.400
to keep
the blue team's hopes alive.

16:08.468 --> 16:12.504
This is a Japanese noodle
pan-seared chicken,

16:12.572 --> 16:15.874
fresh napa cabbage, bok chewy.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.275
What the
is bok chewy?

16:17.342 --> 16:19.544
You mean bok choy, fool?

16:19.611 --> 16:23.614
My sauce is a soy sauce.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.616
You don't... see?
That's what I'm sayin'.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.286
This on top
is a fried herb leaf?

16:28.353 --> 16:31.454
Um, I'm not actually sure
what the herb is.

16:31.522 --> 16:34.658
This is my first time actually
making Japanese cuisine.

16:34.726 --> 16:37.127
I don't see much chicken
on Japanese menus.

16:37.195 --> 16:39.296
No, certainly,
this looks very home-style.

16:39.363 --> 16:42.265
Yeah.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.668
I think when you eat
the noodles with the chicken,

16:44.735 --> 16:46.135
that it all comes together.

16:46.203 --> 16:47.303
So I may not know
these ingredients,

16:47.370 --> 16:49.271
but I know flavor,
I know taste,

16:49.339 --> 16:51.240
and it tastes
pretty good.

16:51.308 --> 16:54.043
Chicken's a little dry.

16:56.714 --> 16:58.915
Uh, for me, it's more Chinese
than Japanese.

16:58.982 --> 17:00.282
<i>That's right.</i>

17:00.350 --> 17:01.750
If I was looking
for something Japanese,

17:01.784 --> 17:03.351
I have to say I'd be
a little disappointed.

17:03.419 --> 17:06.354
Is it red team or blue team?

17:06.422 --> 17:08.323
That one, it's a no-brainer.
That's the red team.

17:08.390 --> 17:10.057
Thank you very much.
Good job, Susan.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.693
Yay! I got the point
for the red team.

17:12.761 --> 17:14.361
We win yet again.

17:14.429 --> 17:15.896
<i>Great job.
Good job.</i>

17:15.964 --> 17:19.633
Whoo!

17:19.701 --> 17:21.001
Thank you very much.
Will you join me in thanking

17:21.069 --> 17:23.403
this extraordinary
talented writer Dana Bowen?

17:23.471 --> 17:24.605
<i>Yes, great job.
Thank you so much.</i>

17:24.672 --> 17:25.872
Thank you so much.
It's a pleasure.

17:25.940 --> 17:26.973
<i>Thank you so much.
Thank you.</i>

17:27.040 --> 17:29.542
Best wishes.
Thank you.

17:29.610 --> 17:30.643
Red team.

17:30.711 --> 17:31.945
Yes, chef?

17:32.012 --> 17:33.379
Congratulations.
Thank you, chef.

17:33.447 --> 17:34.480
You're going shopping...

17:36.350 --> 17:38.985
At the world-famous
Kitson Store.

17:39.053 --> 17:40.419
Oh!
Ooh.

17:40.487 --> 17:41.253
<i>Amazing.</i>

17:41.320 --> 17:43.088
In fact...

17:43.156 --> 17:45.423
There's $2,000.

17:45.491 --> 17:46.358
Come over, Cyndi, please.

17:46.425 --> 17:48.260
<i>Share that amongst yourselves.</i>

17:48.327 --> 17:49.294
Uh, 2 grand.
Oh, my God, thank you, chef.

17:49.362 --> 17:50.395
Oh, my God.

17:50.463 --> 17:52.497
Holy schmokes.
Thank you so much, chef.

17:52.565 --> 17:53.431
Thank you, chef.

17:53.499 --> 17:54.933
They got $2,000.

17:55.001 --> 17:56.501
We still in a recession.

17:56.569 --> 17:58.335
I need to go
on a shopping spree.

17:58.403 --> 18:00.738
I coulda used me a good bra.

18:00.806 --> 18:02.673
Ladies, you'll relax afterwards

18:02.741 --> 18:05.442
and enjoy lunch
at the exclusive restaurant

18:05.510 --> 18:07.344
where you have
your own floor...

18:08.546 --> 18:09.480
At Mr. Chow.

18:10.615 --> 18:11.949
Oh, my God!

18:13.885 --> 18:17.921
Upstairs, there's an amazing
gift box for you yet again.

18:17.989 --> 18:19.156
Thank you, chef.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.190
Head out the doors.
Enjoy your day.

18:20.258 --> 18:21.224
Thank you, chef.

18:21.292 --> 18:22.325
<i>You earned it.</i>

18:22.393 --> 18:23.860
Cyndi, hold that cash tight.

18:23.928 --> 18:27.130
As if the $2,000 and the private
lunch at Mr. chow

18:27.198 --> 18:28.831
is not enough...

18:30.466 --> 18:31.801
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

18:31.868 --> 18:35.537
We also got an entire set
of all-clad cookware.

18:35.605 --> 18:37.840
I could cry.
I am so happy.

18:37.908 --> 18:38.908
Awesome!

18:38.975 --> 18:40.609
Yeah, girls!

18:40.677 --> 18:43.745
Blue team, Hell's Kitchen
will be open tonight.

18:43.814 --> 18:46.314
First, there is a big shipment
of wine coming in.

18:46.381 --> 18:48.749
<i>Also, clean all the stemware,</i>

18:48.818 --> 18:51.019
cut 40 pounds of limes,

18:51.086 --> 18:52.553
lemons into wedges.

18:52.621 --> 18:53.754
Great.

18:53.823 --> 18:56.590
And then,
I would like both kitchens

18:56.658 --> 18:59.760
prepped and ready ahead
of tonight's dinner service.

18:59.829 --> 19:01.361
Nedra...

19:01.429 --> 19:03.563
<i>Welcome to the blue team.
Yeah.</i>

19:03.631 --> 19:05.498
Get out of here.

19:05.566 --> 19:07.767
I'm telling these
right now

19:07.836 --> 19:09.502
they the reason why we lost.

19:09.570 --> 19:12.372
I ain't liftin' no damn wine
to break my back.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.640
Just give me two.

19:13.708 --> 19:15.843
This heavy.
I'm telling y'all right now.

19:15.910 --> 19:19.378
Of course it's heavy.
Four cases of wine.

19:20.848 --> 19:22.514
Heavy as hell.

19:22.582 --> 19:23.682
Nedra didn't do good
in the challenge,

19:23.750 --> 19:24.550
and she's definitely
not pulling

19:24.617 --> 19:25.918
her weight in this punishment.

19:25.986 --> 19:27.987
It's two more boxes.
They heavy as hell.

19:28.055 --> 19:29.889
Nedra, could you carry something
on your way back in

19:29.957 --> 19:31.390
instead of having
empty hands?

19:31.458 --> 19:33.825
seven boxes.
What the?

19:33.893 --> 19:35.493
While most
of the blue team works

19:35.561 --> 19:36.962
to empty the delivery truck...

19:37.029 --> 19:38.730
How come I'm doing
all the heavy lifting,

19:38.797 --> 19:40.398
and I'm the only one
that got a point today?

19:40.466 --> 19:42.433
The red team is
ready to fill their closets.

19:43.769 --> 19:45.237
Oh, God, good, good.
Ooh, yes, yes, yes.

19:45.304 --> 19:46.938
♪ This is gorgeous ♪

19:47.006 --> 19:48.606
Bracelet.

19:48.674 --> 19:49.806
I love the jacket.
The jacket is definitely my favorite.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.308
I love, love.
I love the color.

19:51.376 --> 19:52.843
I am like a kid at Disneyland.

19:52.911 --> 19:54.444
Wow.

19:54.512 --> 19:56.580
I can't wait to spend
every last dime.

19:56.647 --> 19:58.282
I love it.
I love it, love it, love it,

19:58.350 --> 19:59.483
love it, love it,
love it, love it.

19:59.550 --> 20:01.551
Whoo!

20:01.619 --> 20:03.653
Thank you, chef Ramsay!

20:03.721 --> 20:04.855
While the
red team heads off

20:04.922 --> 20:05.855
for an expensive,
glamorous lunch...

20:05.923 --> 20:06.956
This sucks.

20:07.024 --> 20:08.324
The blue team...

20:08.392 --> 20:10.659
In the challenge wasn't no...
no communication.

20:10.727 --> 20:12.195
None at all.

20:12.263 --> 20:14.364
Gets some
unwelcomed free advice.

20:14.431 --> 20:15.498
How can you work dysfunctional?

20:15.565 --> 20:16.732
Nedra.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.035
If you can't do it,
you can't do it.

20:19.103 --> 20:20.736
<i>Like, everything
all over the cutting board.</i>

20:20.804 --> 20:22.437
Like, I can't work
like that, seriously.

20:22.505 --> 20:23.671
Oh, man.

20:23.739 --> 20:25.807
Nedra is like
Charlie Brown's teacher.

20:25.875 --> 20:27.209
Wah, wah, wah, wah!

20:27.277 --> 20:29.477
There is no cleanness over...
in the blue kitchen.

20:29.545 --> 20:31.713
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

20:31.781 --> 20:33.415
You can't see what the hell
going on.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.884
Wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah, wah.

20:35.952 --> 20:37.684
Apps, I push out fast as hell.

20:37.752 --> 20:39.186
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

20:39.254 --> 20:41.122
You know what I'm sayin'?

20:41.189 --> 20:43.124
Unbelievable.

20:43.191 --> 20:45.492
While the blue team
gets an earful from Nedra...

20:45.560 --> 20:46.660
I volunteered
to come over here.

20:46.728 --> 20:48.296
Pshh.

20:48.363 --> 20:50.431
The red team
is missing her terribly...

20:50.498 --> 20:52.033
To the best day ever.
Perfect day.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.800
<i>Yes, ever.
Absolutely.</i>

20:53.867 --> 20:54.767
Or maybe not.

20:54.835 --> 20:55.802
Oh, wow.
Ooh.

20:55.869 --> 20:57.070
That bok choy is killer.

20:57.138 --> 20:58.271
We gotta keep
our winning streak going.

20:58.339 --> 21:00.040
Mm-hmm.

21:00.107 --> 21:01.975
We have some momentum going
right now on the red team.

21:02.043 --> 21:06.779
I am so happy that I didn't go
to the blue team.

21:06.847 --> 21:07.713
Black jackets.

21:07.781 --> 21:09.915
Ladies!

21:09.983 --> 21:11.350
How do you guys look?

21:11.418 --> 21:12.551
Good, this one's almost done.

21:12.618 --> 21:14.086
Looking good, chef.

21:14.154 --> 21:16.788
I'm a little nervous
because I got tweedledee

21:16.856 --> 21:18.690
and tweedledum
prepping my station.

21:18.758 --> 21:19.691
My cheat sheet.

21:19.759 --> 21:20.826
Holy.

21:20.893 --> 21:24.029
They stupid as hell.

21:24.097 --> 21:26.730
Home, sweet home.

21:26.798 --> 21:28.066
Hi, guys.

21:28.133 --> 21:29.700
The blue team, they've been
getting prepared

21:29.768 --> 21:31.902
for dinner service all day,
while we're out and about,

21:31.971 --> 21:33.237
and I'm definitely nervous.

21:33.305 --> 21:34.705
We need to get in that zone
and get prepared

21:34.773 --> 21:36.074
to kick their butts again.

21:36.141 --> 21:38.676
We should be moving it
faster, though.

21:38.743 --> 21:40.044
Why aren't these on?

21:40.112 --> 21:41.511
What do we got left?

21:41.579 --> 21:42.512
This is...
this is the last of it.

21:42.580 --> 21:44.014
I go in the blue kitchen.

21:44.082 --> 21:46.883
Every station done except
for the station I'm working.

21:46.951 --> 21:48.885
Hey, Anthony, what happened
to the baby gems you cut?

21:48.953 --> 21:50.520
They're down there.

21:50.588 --> 21:51.955
It's only, like, three orders.

21:52.023 --> 21:53.857
What the
y'all been doing all day?

21:53.924 --> 21:57.793
All right, guys.
You have about 15 minutes left.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.998
Nedra, are you changing
the setup here, I hope.

22:02.065 --> 22:03.832
Uh, I'm just getting it
organized, chef.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.101
You all got customers
waiting at the door.

22:05.168 --> 22:06.402
Let's go, Nedra.

22:06.470 --> 22:08.704
Chef talking about doors
about to open,

22:08.771 --> 22:11.740
and I'm still trying
to organize my station.

22:11.808 --> 22:14.342
Nedra, what is going on
over there?

22:14.410 --> 22:16.144
You are dragging.
You need to catch up.

22:16.212 --> 22:17.612
We can't have you fall behind

22:17.679 --> 22:19.481
before we even get
to dinner service.

22:19.548 --> 22:20.915
Ready.

22:20.983 --> 22:22.850
She's not even set up
on her section here.

22:22.918 --> 22:25.120
There's
all over the place.

22:25.187 --> 22:27.555
Please, Nedra.
We gotta go, we gotta go.

22:27.623 --> 22:29.189
<i>Come on, Nedra.</i>

22:29.257 --> 22:32.259
How come Nedra's the only one
who's not ready?

22:38.544 --> 22:40.946
The doors of hell's
kitchen will open in ten minutes,

22:41.013 --> 22:42.580
and the newest member
of the blue team...

22:42.648 --> 22:44.548
She's not even set up
on her section here.

22:44.615 --> 22:45.416
<i>There's
all over the place.</i>

22:45.483 --> 22:46.650
<i>Let's go, Nedra.</i>

22:46.717 --> 22:48.485
Has already fallen behind.

22:48.553 --> 22:49.486
Let's speed up
a little bit there, Nedra.

22:49.554 --> 22:50.955
Yes, chef!

22:51.022 --> 22:53.357
Not only did these bitches
not prep my station right,

22:53.425 --> 22:54.825
but it wasn't prepped at all.

22:54.892 --> 22:57.194
I hate that, dude.

22:57.262 --> 22:59.830
Right now, I can't let
that get to my head.

22:59.897 --> 23:01.397
I need
to get it together quick.

23:01.465 --> 23:02.898
Nedra, you all right?
You need anything?

23:02.967 --> 23:05.801
Hell, no.

23:05.869 --> 23:08.137
Ladies, let's go.
Yes, chef.

23:08.205 --> 23:09.572
Let's go.
Line up, guys.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.874
Please, blue team.
No longer guys anymore.

23:11.942 --> 23:14.177
We have a lady in there.
Okay.

23:14.244 --> 23:17.946
This competition right now
is wide open.

23:18.014 --> 23:19.781
The most important thing is,
with only four of you left,

23:19.849 --> 23:21.483
there is no place to hide.
Got it?

23:21.550 --> 23:22.750
Yes, chef.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.118
Good, get on your sections.
Get set up.

23:24.186 --> 23:25.386
Let's go.
Yes, chef.

23:25.454 --> 23:26.320
Move.
Come on, man. We got this.

23:26.388 --> 23:27.788
Jean-Philippe.
Chef.

23:27.856 --> 23:29.156
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Let's go.

23:29.224 --> 23:31.459
Yes, chef.

23:33.000 --> 23:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

23:40.501 --> 23:42.002
Guys, we got people walking in.

23:42.069 --> 23:44.204
Tickets will be here
in, like, three minutes.

23:44.271 --> 23:46.139
Step up and deliver.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.074
I want you to be talking to me today.
Always.

23:48.142 --> 23:50.176
Heard?
Cool.

23:50.244 --> 23:53.046
Hell's Kitchen reservations
are always in high demand,

23:53.114 --> 23:54.714
and tonight is no different.

23:54.781 --> 23:57.416
I would like
the lobster risotto.

23:57.484 --> 23:59.385
<i>And I'm having scallops.
Scallops to start.</i>

23:59.452 --> 24:01.153
But with
only 8 chefs remaining

24:01.221 --> 24:02.821
from the original 20,

24:02.889 --> 24:06.325
chef Ramsay's expectations
are higher than ever.

24:06.393 --> 24:07.826
V.I.P.
Kelly Hu, chef.

24:07.894 --> 24:09.061
Here we go, ladies.
Yes, chef.

24:09.129 --> 24:10.595
On order, please.
Watch this table, yeah?

24:10.663 --> 24:12.930
<i>Kelly Hu, eh?
From Hawaii Five-0.</i>

24:12.998 --> 24:15.066
Two risotto, two scallops.
Yes, chef.

24:15.134 --> 24:16.434
In the red kitchen,

24:16.502 --> 24:19.603
it's up to Ja'nel on fish
and Susan on appetizers

24:19.671 --> 24:21.639
to get their team
off to a good start.

24:21.706 --> 24:23.341
Please, someone can...
if someone wants to taste this

24:23.409 --> 24:25.576
and give me
a second opinion, please.

24:25.644 --> 24:26.877
More salt!
More salt.

24:26.945 --> 24:28.645
I'm all over the app station

24:28.712 --> 24:31.948
because Susan has had mistakes,
had mistakes, had mistakes.

24:32.016 --> 24:33.850
Scallops walking.
Walk the risotto, please.

24:33.918 --> 24:35.152
Thank you.
All right.

24:35.219 --> 24:36.920
Here are the two risottos.

24:36.987 --> 24:38.255
Four, yes?
Two.

24:38.322 --> 24:39.589
Susan!

24:39.657 --> 24:40.623
Oh,.

24:40.691 --> 24:41.791
Come here, you, 'cause I think

24:41.859 --> 24:42.959
you got a little bit stupid.

24:43.027 --> 24:45.127
So two risotto, yeah?

24:45.195 --> 24:46.262
Yes, chef.
There's two there.

24:46.329 --> 24:47.263
There's a whole
pan wasted.

24:47.330 --> 24:48.330
Yes, chef.
Now, look at me.

24:48.398 --> 24:49.498
At this stage
in the competition,

24:49.566 --> 24:51.067
I don't expect to waste
all that.

24:51.134 --> 24:52.435
<i>Yes, chef.
You do?</i>

24:52.502 --> 24:53.569
I just... I don't get you.

24:53.636 --> 24:55.171
You make your life
so much more difficult

24:55.238 --> 24:56.805
when it is just so simple.

24:57.874 --> 25:00.408
Service, please.

25:00.476 --> 25:01.443
Here we are.

25:01.510 --> 25:03.111
Ooh, wow.

25:03.179 --> 25:04.479
<i>Lobster risotto.</i>

25:04.547 --> 25:05.547
It is gorgeous.

25:05.614 --> 25:07.248
Stop yourself

25:07.316 --> 25:08.983
and literally get your head
out of your.

25:09.051 --> 25:10.385
Sorry, chef.

25:10.453 --> 25:12.620
No matter what I do,
I'm gonna get yelled at.

25:12.688 --> 25:15.490
I have to just not let it
drag me down.

25:15.558 --> 25:17.357
While Susan gets a
handle on her portion control...

25:17.425 --> 25:18.625
Thanks for your help, Mary.
We got this.

25:18.693 --> 25:20.527
No problem.
Yeah.

25:20.595 --> 25:21.962
All eyes are on Nedra

25:22.029 --> 25:23.997
to lead the charge
on appetizers.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.599
Two scallops, one capellini,
one risotto.

25:25.666 --> 25:26.700
How long?

25:26.767 --> 25:28.202
Two minutes on risotto.

25:28.269 --> 25:29.769
Two minutes on the risotto?
I'm firing scallops.

25:29.837 --> 25:31.305
Let's go.

25:31.372 --> 25:33.239
Hey, I need just some salt.
Right there, right there, Nedra.

25:33.307 --> 25:34.540
<i>That's sugar.
I need the salt.</i>

25:34.608 --> 25:36.342
No, that's salt.
I'm looking at the box, Nedra!

25:36.410 --> 25:37.477
Don't panic, baby.

25:37.544 --> 25:38.711
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:38.778 --> 25:40.346
Coming to the pass
with risotto.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.081
Scallops.
I'm pulling the scallops now.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.150
Right here, chef.

25:44.218 --> 25:45.985
Go, go, go.
Let's go, go, go. risotto.

25:46.052 --> 25:47.487
Yes, chef.
I'm coming right now.

25:47.554 --> 25:48.953
Yeah, but it's not fast enough.

25:49.021 --> 25:50.355
Nedra's over there
like she's

25:50.423 --> 25:51.356
Painting a picture...

25:53.526 --> 25:57.061
Like a Picasso
or something.

25:57.130 --> 25:58.330
Move your ass.

25:58.397 --> 26:00.432
Look at the energy
in here.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.066
Risotto.
Is anyone listening?

26:02.135 --> 26:03.401
Yes, chef. Let's go!
Yes, chef.

26:03.469 --> 26:05.035
<i>Keep pushing.
Coming to the pass.</i>

26:05.103 --> 26:08.071
Right behind you.
Hot, chef.

26:12.310 --> 26:15.045
All of you, come here.

26:15.113 --> 26:17.648
Quick!
Taste.

26:17.715 --> 26:18.815
In the first mouthful,
what's the thing

26:18.883 --> 26:20.050
that hits you straightaway?

26:20.118 --> 26:21.151
Salt, chef.

26:21.218 --> 26:22.818
Too salty.

26:22.886 --> 26:24.987
Yep.
Dude, Nedra, come on, man.

26:25.055 --> 26:25.988
Pull...
pull your together.

26:26.056 --> 26:27.957
And what happens now, Anthony?

26:28.025 --> 26:30.126
Because we can't get off
to a great start,

26:30.194 --> 26:31.761
the fish and meat
is gonna get slammed.

26:31.828 --> 26:33.829
Right, right, absolutely.
We'll get this fixed.

26:33.897 --> 26:35.632
I don't see Nedra

26:35.699 --> 26:38.634
bringing anything extra
to the team right now.

26:38.668 --> 26:40.335
Nedra, you just work
all the hots, alright?

26:40.403 --> 26:41.870
Yes, chef.

26:41.937 --> 26:43.238
We need a leader in the team.

26:43.306 --> 26:44.873
We need someone to step up.

26:44.940 --> 26:47.342
Zach, can you get over there
to help her out?

26:47.410 --> 26:50.011
Just colds, salads
and scallop garnish, that's it.

26:50.079 --> 26:51.547
Walking to the pass
with the scallops, chef.

26:51.614 --> 26:53.080
Very nice, Jon.
Thank you, chef.

26:53.148 --> 26:54.815
I'm walking out with risotto
right now.

26:54.883 --> 26:57.318
Why are you walking?
I'd rather you run.

26:57.386 --> 27:00.388
Hot right behind you.

27:03.225 --> 27:04.192
That risotto
was delicious, Nedra.

27:04.259 --> 27:05.493
Thank you, chef.

27:05.561 --> 27:07.628
I said, "Oh, lord, whoo!"

27:07.696 --> 27:09.529
Service, please.
Go.

27:09.597 --> 27:11.164
Baby, keep it rollin'.
Keep it rollin'.

27:11.232 --> 27:12.432
Keep the wheels on tight.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.568
We can do this.
We can do this.

27:14.635 --> 27:16.269
Thanks to Anthony's leadership,

27:16.337 --> 27:19.606
Nedra has delivered
on the risotto.

27:19.674 --> 27:21.374
Meanwhile,
in the red kitchen...

27:21.442 --> 27:23.009
Two scallop, two capellini.
Yes, chef.

27:23.077 --> 27:24.943
Chef Ramsay
is looking to the women

27:25.011 --> 27:26.745
to work smarter and faster.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.080
Drive it.
Let's go.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.515
Two scallops, two capellini.

27:29.583 --> 27:31.383
How long, girls?
One minute!

27:31.451 --> 27:33.051
I haven't dropped these yet.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.853
You got to let me know.
Let me know.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.222
Let's go, ladies.

27:36.289 --> 27:37.656
Ja'nel knows
what she needs to do.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.191
I mean, apps are going out.

27:39.259 --> 27:40.991
She's gonna get left in the dust
if she doesn't step it up.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.227
I'm walking the capellini.
Okay.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.161
Scallops walking.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.364
<i>Let's go.
Give me that salad.</i>

27:48.634 --> 27:49.800
They overcooked?

27:49.868 --> 27:51.135
No, no, no, no, no.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.705
Oh,.
She only did one side.

27:53.772 --> 27:54.805
Yep, we're moving.
We got this.

27:54.873 --> 27:56.173
We're not moving,

27:56.241 --> 27:58.442
and you didn't...
you haven't got anything.

27:58.509 --> 28:00.110
What is that?

28:00.177 --> 28:01.345
I'll do it again, chef.
I'm sorry, chef.

28:01.412 --> 28:03.046
Look at them.
Just touch them.

28:03.114 --> 28:04.881
Just touch them.
That is disgusting!

28:04.949 --> 28:06.516
This is my worst nightmare.

28:08.219 --> 28:10.186
I cannot believe you done that.

28:10.255 --> 28:11.555
<i>What is happening in here?</i>

28:11.623 --> 28:13.723
She's cooking four risottos.
We need two.

28:13.790 --> 28:16.125
And you bastardize
your scallops.

28:16.192 --> 28:18.127
I reduced the menu,
I pulled down the appetizer,

28:18.194 --> 28:20.229
pulled down the entrees
for you to shine!

28:20.297 --> 28:22.030
Ja'nel is
drowning at this point.

28:22.098 --> 28:23.666
You are dragging the team down.

28:23.734 --> 28:26.502
What the is going on?

28:32.294 --> 28:34.496
It's 45 minutes
into dinner service,

28:34.564 --> 28:36.865
and Ja'nel's
shocking raw scallops...

28:36.933 --> 28:39.701
I cannot believe you done that.
Disgusting!

28:39.769 --> 28:41.904
Have brought an
already wobbly red kitchen

28:41.971 --> 28:43.605
to a complete stop.

28:43.673 --> 28:44.907
<i>What is
happening in here?</i>

28:44.974 --> 28:47.274
She's cooking four risottos.
We need two.

28:47.342 --> 28:48.743
And you bastardized
your scallops.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.244
I just want to slap her.

28:50.311 --> 28:53.780
Ja'nel, wake up, come on.
You're so much better than this.

28:53.848 --> 28:55.114
Get a grip!
Yes, chef.

28:55.182 --> 28:57.083
You'll get it, chef.
You'll get better, chef.

28:57.151 --> 28:58.852
Give me two minutes
on those scallops.

28:58.920 --> 28:59.886
We got this. We're good.

28:59.954 --> 29:01.555
"We got this"?
no.

29:01.622 --> 29:02.789
She can't even cook a scallop.

29:02.857 --> 29:04.090
<i>Let's go, Ja'nel.</i>

29:04.158 --> 29:05.659
Don't worry, ladies.
I'll get it.

29:05.726 --> 29:07.260
This re-firing
of the scallops

29:07.327 --> 29:10.696
has to be the most perfect dish
I've ever cooked in my life.

29:10.764 --> 29:12.164
Speed up, Ja'nel.
Let's go.

29:12.231 --> 29:13.231
Walking on scallops.

29:13.299 --> 29:14.232
Get it, girl.

29:14.300 --> 29:15.300
Behind you.

29:15.368 --> 29:17.502
Sorry about the scallops, chef.

29:22.909 --> 29:24.409
Go, please.

29:24.477 --> 29:26.077
Ja'nel's second
attempt with scallops

29:26.144 --> 29:28.012
satisfies chef Ramsay...
Go.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.413
Let's keep it up, ladies!

29:29.481 --> 29:30.715
That's right.
Keep moving forward.

29:30.783 --> 29:31.950
Whew.

29:32.017 --> 29:33.517
And the diners.

29:33.586 --> 29:34.786
It's delicious.

29:34.853 --> 29:36.487
Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen,

29:36.555 --> 29:38.255
the newest member
of the blue team...

29:38.323 --> 29:39.824
W-watch out.
Move out my way, Zach.

29:39.892 --> 29:40.992
Move out my way.
I don't need nothing right now.

29:41.060 --> 29:42.059
Just move out my way, please.

29:42.126 --> 29:43.426
Okay, all right.

29:43.494 --> 29:44.861
Isn't exactly playing nice.

29:44.929 --> 29:45.896
Nedra.

29:45.964 --> 29:46.964
Yes, chef!

29:47.031 --> 29:49.165
Why can't he do the cold?

29:49.233 --> 29:50.433
Why did she kick you off there?

29:50.501 --> 29:51.702
She said she don't need
any help.

29:51.769 --> 29:53.570
My worry is the slowness.

29:53.638 --> 29:55.939
Chef, just watch out
and let me do this.

29:56.007 --> 29:56.873
I don't need no help.

29:56.941 --> 29:58.074
If I was on the blue team,

29:58.141 --> 29:59.942
I'd have her off
the appetizers,

30:00.010 --> 30:00.977
I'd put her on the garnish,

30:01.044 --> 30:02.544
and someone with a pair
of

30:02.613 --> 30:05.781
would step up
and take over that mess.

30:05.849 --> 30:09.218
All of you, come here.
Just look.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.353
Just look
at the mess in here.

30:11.421 --> 30:13.722
The, the disarray,

30:13.789 --> 30:16.024
the disorganization, and look.

30:16.092 --> 30:18.493
Look, look.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.928
Look at the mess!

30:19.996 --> 30:21.963
Yes, chef!
I'm gonna get it together!

30:22.031 --> 30:23.632
Then, let's do it.
Yeah, organize your.

30:23.699 --> 30:25.967
Yeah..
Zach, you.

30:26.035 --> 30:27.502
No, there's no "Zach."
There's no "Zach."

30:27.569 --> 30:29.170
You had this
like a mess.

30:29.238 --> 30:30.370
I don't need nobody
to help me.

30:30.438 --> 30:32.172
Zach, move out the way.

30:32.240 --> 30:35.909
He is a stupid
, okay?

30:35.977 --> 30:37.177
You gonna pull
this together?

30:37.245 --> 30:39.079
Yes, I'm gonna pull
this together!

30:39.147 --> 30:40.380
<i>Do it now, or I'm
taking over your station.</i>

30:40.448 --> 30:42.349
Come on, Nedra.
You gotta be organized, baby.

30:42.416 --> 30:43.884
30 seconds, we walkin'.

30:43.952 --> 30:45.119
Scallops are out, then!

30:45.186 --> 30:47.153
I'm comin', chef, right now.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.054
And bring the
for the scallops, please,

30:48.122 --> 30:49.388
so we can start plating.

30:49.456 --> 30:50.823
Zach is bringing it up
right now.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.558
Let's go, Zach.
You ready? You walking?

30:52.626 --> 30:54.193
Walking to the pass
with risotto.

30:54.261 --> 30:58.264
Hot behind you, chef.

30:58.331 --> 30:59.632
Service, please.

30:59.700 --> 31:00.933
Come on, guys.
Keep it up.

31:01.001 --> 31:03.001
Despite Nedra's resistance,

31:03.069 --> 31:05.003
the blue team
has come to her aid,

31:05.071 --> 31:06.672
and appetizers
are leaving the kitchen.

31:06.739 --> 31:08.740
Delish.
Thank you.

31:08.808 --> 31:10.375
Meanwhile, the red kitchen...

31:10.442 --> 31:11.109
<i>Susan!
Yes, chef?</i>

31:11.177 --> 31:12.144
Keep it working.

31:12.211 --> 31:13.311
Yes, chef.
It's working, chef.

31:13.379 --> 31:15.613
The risotto walking.
Tails, behind you.

31:15.682 --> 31:16.748
<i>Go, please.</i>

31:16.816 --> 31:18.282
Push, push, push.
Yes, yes, yes.

31:18.349 --> 31:19.917
Has hit its stride

31:19.985 --> 31:21.085
and is moving on to entrees...

31:21.153 --> 31:22.987
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

31:23.055 --> 31:25.255
But over an
hour into dinner service...

31:25.323 --> 31:27.825
Jon, scallops shouldn't be
cooking on the side.

31:27.893 --> 31:29.794
They'll boil.
W... They're wasted.

31:29.861 --> 31:32.596
The blue team is still
fumbling their way through appetizers.

31:32.664 --> 31:35.331
Find me one more portion
of scallops quickly.

31:35.399 --> 31:36.632
Got the pan nice and hot?

31:36.701 --> 31:38.501
You know what to...

31:38.569 --> 31:40.734
<i>I know how to do scallops.
I know, I'm sorry.</i>

31:41.005 --> 31:42.739
Just get out of the way.

31:42.807 --> 31:44.841
I know what I'm doing.
I've got this.

31:44.909 --> 31:46.576
Scallops!
I'm ready to walk.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.878
Right here, chef.
Right behind.

31:48.946 --> 31:52.881
Scallops here, chef.

31:52.949 --> 31:54.950
This is a joke.
They're not seared.

31:55.018 --> 31:57.052
All of you, come here, quick!

31:57.120 --> 31:58.220
Are you serious?

31:58.287 --> 32:00.455
Like mush.
Mush, mush, mush!

32:00.523 --> 32:01.757
It's just a joke.

32:02.826 --> 32:03.826
God, are you kidding me?

32:03.893 --> 32:05.493
We can't even get past hot apps

32:05.561 --> 32:07.228
this late in the competition?

32:07.295 --> 32:09.363
God, it's humiliating.

32:09.431 --> 32:11.199
Yet again, we
are struggling.

32:11.266 --> 32:12.967
I'm putting in the gas.
I'm turning on the engine.

32:13.035 --> 32:15.803
I'm driving
every table.

32:15.871 --> 32:17.671
I'm done!

32:17.740 --> 32:19.140
Please don't let this
be happening again.

32:19.208 --> 32:21.609
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

32:21.676 --> 32:23.543
off, off,
off, off.

32:23.611 --> 32:26.346
Get out!
Get out!

32:26.413 --> 32:28.949
Idiots.

32:31.953 --> 32:33.019
Way to go, blue team.

32:33.087 --> 32:34.821
Way to grab your.

32:34.889 --> 32:36.656
I'm furious.
I'm super upset.

32:36.724 --> 32:37.557
I didn't get a chance
to cook?

32:39.292 --> 32:41.193
With the blue
team out of the picture...

32:43.063 --> 32:45.330
Chef Ramsay focuses
his attention on the red team.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.867
For the V.I.P., two halibut,
one bass, one Wellington.

32:47.934 --> 32:49.534
How long?
Three minutes, chef.

32:49.602 --> 32:52.204
But his patience
is clearly wearing thin.

32:52.272 --> 32:54.405
So when you hear these halibuts
fire, you're gonna work the pan!

32:54.473 --> 32:55.706
<i>Yes, chef.
Work your stove!</i>

32:55.775 --> 32:56.875
And stay in front
of it, Ja'nel.

32:56.942 --> 32:58.009
Yes, chef.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.811
After my mistake
on the scallops,

32:59.879 --> 33:02.313
I'm under
a huge magnifying glass,

33:02.381 --> 33:05.917
so I'm just gonna keep
my head down and keep working.

33:05.985 --> 33:08.352
All right, I'm gonna slice
the Wellingtons. You ready?

33:08.420 --> 33:10.320
I'm ready.
Garnish.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.956
Can I walk on garnish, girls?

33:13.024 --> 33:14.524
Yes, I'm pulling out
the halibut now.

33:14.592 --> 33:16.359
Garnish walking.
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

33:16.427 --> 33:17.527
Come on.
I hope it's walking.

33:17.595 --> 33:19.496
Behind.
Move, Ja'nel!

33:19.563 --> 33:22.332
Yes, chef.

33:26.303 --> 33:27.303
<i>And that's raw.</i>

33:27.370 --> 33:28.370
There's gonna be a...

33:28.438 --> 33:30.239
No, it's not four minutes.

33:30.307 --> 33:32.374
There's... Come here!
It's sushi time.

33:32.442 --> 33:35.278
Just touch that.
Just touch that.

33:35.345 --> 33:36.946
I don't know
what you're doing now.

33:37.014 --> 33:38.114
Do you know who this is for?

33:38.182 --> 33:39.648
<i>The V.I.P., chef.</i>

33:39.716 --> 33:43.084
The one V.I.P. in the house,
and I'm ruining it.

33:43.152 --> 33:44.619
Sorry, chef.

33:44.687 --> 33:45.787
I hope this is a bad dream.

33:45.855 --> 33:48.223
I mean, someone pinch me,
slap me,

33:48.291 --> 33:50.625
shake me out of this hellhole
that I'm in right now.

33:50.693 --> 33:51.960
I'm done.

33:52.028 --> 33:53.561
You, you, you, you,
off out of here.

33:53.629 --> 33:54.729
me.

33:54.797 --> 33:56.497
Get out!
Hey, excuse me, madam?

33:56.565 --> 33:57.632
Yes, chef?
" me"?

33:57.700 --> 33:59.333
How about you?

33:59.400 --> 34:01.802
How are we making
these stupid mistakes?

34:01.870 --> 34:03.704
I'm done.
off.

34:03.771 --> 34:05.539
Out. Get out!

34:05.606 --> 34:07.441
Get out!

34:13.891 --> 34:16.092
It's nearly two
hours into dinner service.

34:16.161 --> 34:18.695
With the blue team already
banished from the kitchen

34:18.763 --> 34:21.297
and Ja'nel making another
mistake on the fish station...

34:21.366 --> 34:22.966
<i>It's sushi time.</i>

34:23.034 --> 34:24.833
Chef Ramsay has
decided that it's closing time.

34:24.902 --> 34:26.170
I'm done.

34:26.237 --> 34:28.004
You, you, you, you,
off out of here.

34:28.072 --> 34:29.039
me.

34:29.106 --> 34:30.406
Get out!

34:30.474 --> 34:32.875
Hey, and " me"?
How about you?

34:32.943 --> 34:33.676
<i>Yes, chef.
I'm done!</i>

34:33.743 --> 34:36.212
Absolutely, chef.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.646
, man.

34:37.714 --> 34:40.116
I was up on
all my garnishes.

34:40.184 --> 34:41.551
useless.

34:41.618 --> 34:43.652
Hey, J.P.,
deeply apologize,

34:43.719 --> 34:45.120
but this has been
the worst service.

34:45.188 --> 34:48.690
Shut it down.

34:48.757 --> 34:52.025
Ja'nel, what happened
to you tonight?

34:52.094 --> 34:53.128
<i>I don't know.
I don't know.</i>

34:53.196 --> 34:54.563
Ja'nel's been money

34:54.630 --> 34:56.398
since the beginning
of this competition.

34:56.466 --> 34:58.266
Tonight, she fell hard.

34:58.334 --> 34:59.767
I cannot believe it.

34:59.835 --> 35:02.803
<i>I cannot believe it.</i>

35:04.772 --> 35:06.307
Get both teams downstairs now.

35:06.374 --> 35:08.809
All teams downstairs.

35:10.144 --> 35:11.644
Stay there.

35:11.712 --> 35:13.813
That was embarrassing.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.816
The worst service
we've ever had.

35:16.883 --> 35:19.785
Four in each kitchen,
supposedly the best four,

35:19.853 --> 35:23.123
or have I sent
the wrong chefs home?

35:23.190 --> 35:24.957
Both teams come up
with one person,

35:25.025 --> 35:26.458
<i>the weakest cook in each team.</i>

35:26.526 --> 35:28.227
Think about everything
that's happened.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.061
Understood?
Yes, chef.

35:30.130 --> 35:32.897
Good. Move.

35:35.568 --> 35:39.804
Ja'nel, tonight was
a bad night for you.

35:39.872 --> 35:41.639
It's very clear.
It's clear as day.

35:41.706 --> 35:43.841
Ja'nel was the reason we got
kicked out of the kitchen.

35:43.908 --> 35:45.909
She should be going up
for elimination.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.911
Do you guys
want me to go up?

35:47.979 --> 35:49.747
I think it's fair.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.483
One dinner service
makes me the weakest.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.552
I don't think so.

35:54.620 --> 35:58.388
There is absolutely no way,
no way,

35:58.456 --> 36:00.990
that I could be considered
the weakest on the red team.

36:01.058 --> 36:02.459
So there's no way
I'm going down

36:02.527 --> 36:04.561
without one hell of a fight.

36:04.629 --> 36:07.164
He said think about everything.

36:07.231 --> 36:08.565
I mean, I-I personally
think that right now,

36:08.633 --> 36:12.035
all of us are equivalent.

36:12.102 --> 36:15.171
I don't think so.

36:15.238 --> 36:17.540
Before me, I think
you should go up.

36:17.607 --> 36:20.142
Why are we even arguing
about it?

36:20.210 --> 36:21.043
Do you think that you're
a better chef than I am?

36:21.110 --> 36:22.911
I do.

36:22.979 --> 36:24.079
There's no way I've made
more mistakes than you have.

36:24.147 --> 36:26.982
You had a lot
of mistakes tonight,

36:27.050 --> 36:29.651
and I think
that makes you weak.

36:29.718 --> 36:31.252
Okay.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.656
Okay, but if you had to choose
between me being on your team

36:34.723 --> 36:37.492
and Susan being on your team,
who would you want?

36:41.063 --> 36:44.599
Oh, my God.

36:44.667 --> 36:47.000
Zach, who you think
the weakest chef is?

36:47.068 --> 36:49.436
Basing on tonight's service,
it would have to be you.

36:49.504 --> 36:52.339
Nope, I'm not
the weakest chef. I'm not.

36:52.407 --> 36:54.675
Nedra, you really
us on apps tonight.

36:54.742 --> 36:56.243
Nedra, before we even
started service,

36:56.311 --> 36:58.912
chef said to chef James,
"Look at Nedra's station."

36:58.979 --> 37:00.847
Hold on, you not
about to beat me down.

37:00.915 --> 37:02.215
Let's get
that straight.

37:02.282 --> 37:04.283
They can kiss
my whole

37:04.351 --> 37:05.984
if they think I'm going up.

37:06.052 --> 37:07.186
They sabotaged me.

37:07.254 --> 37:08.854
I didn't disorganize
my station.

37:08.922 --> 37:10.389
You two did.

37:10.457 --> 37:11.990
What?

37:12.058 --> 37:13.292
My station wasn't ready,

37:13.360 --> 37:14.860
but everybody else's station
was ready.

37:14.928 --> 37:15.961
I want the floor next.

37:16.029 --> 37:17.329
Hold on! Hold on.

37:17.396 --> 37:18.796
<i>My first risotto come good.</i>

37:18.864 --> 37:20.898
Then, you bring
your black ass over there

37:20.966 --> 37:22.166
and my station.

37:22.235 --> 37:24.068
Then, all my risottos
goes out.

37:24.136 --> 37:25.437
Your bitch ass is going up.

37:25.504 --> 37:26.971
<i>Or Anthony, between you two.</i>

37:27.039 --> 37:28.306
Why would Anthony be put up?

37:28.374 --> 37:31.042
Nedra, we're not the red team.

37:31.110 --> 37:32.277
We not scared of your attitude.

37:32.345 --> 37:34.545
Get it all out.
Get it all out now.

37:34.613 --> 37:36.179
You two can
fight about it.

37:36.248 --> 37:38.982
I'm not going up.
that.

37:39.050 --> 37:42.185
<i>You can kiss my ass
if you think I'm going up.</i>

37:42.254 --> 37:44.355
Nedra.

37:44.422 --> 37:45.856
You're going up.

37:45.923 --> 37:47.124
I'm not going up.

37:47.191 --> 37:48.759
you.
I ain't goin' up.

37:48.826 --> 37:52.161
So you and Anthony
need to decide.

37:52.229 --> 37:53.496
Yo' ass is outta here.

37:53.564 --> 37:56.065
you.
This bitch ain't goin' up.

38:02.528 --> 38:03.729
After a dinner service

38:03.796 --> 38:05.764
where the elite eight
failed to impress,

38:05.832 --> 38:08.066
chef Ramsay has asked each team

38:08.134 --> 38:10.335
to come up with one nominee
for elimination.

38:10.402 --> 38:13.605
Susan, red team's nominee
and why.

38:13.672 --> 38:17.108
Chef, tonight,
the red team decided

38:17.175 --> 38:20.177
they wanted to nominate me.

38:20.245 --> 38:21.178
Why?

38:21.246 --> 38:23.380
I'm not sure, chef.

38:23.448 --> 38:25.649
I'm actually a little shocked.

38:25.717 --> 38:27.017
What mistakes
did you make tonight?

38:27.085 --> 38:28.953
I didn't make
any mistakes tonight, chef.

38:29.020 --> 38:32.688
I guess they think you're
the weakest person on the team.

38:34.759 --> 38:36.459
Blue team.
Yes, chef?

38:36.526 --> 38:37.526
Have you reached a decision?

38:37.594 --> 38:38.527
Yes, chef.

38:38.595 --> 38:40.797
No, chef.

38:40.865 --> 38:42.932
Oh, come on.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.034
Jon, tell me.

38:45.102 --> 38:47.570
Nedra completely screwed us
on apps,

38:47.638 --> 38:49.271
<i>didn't have
her station organized.</i>

38:49.338 --> 38:51.673
Chef, I had my station organized, and...
Everybody...

38:51.741 --> 38:52.941
Here we go.

38:53.009 --> 38:55.377
Anthony and Zach rearranged

38:55.444 --> 38:57.012
my station three times, chef.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.046
Sabotaged you?

38:58.114 --> 38:59.782
Yes, chef.

38:59.849 --> 39:00.983
Is that right, Zach?

39:01.050 --> 39:02.450
No, chef.
That's not true at all.

39:02.518 --> 39:04.318
I haven't even gone
to her station

39:04.386 --> 39:06.053
until I went over there
to make the Caesar.

39:06.121 --> 39:08.656
And what... that was total
cluster back there,

39:08.723 --> 39:10.624
and that was all
Zach and Anthony.

39:10.692 --> 39:12.393
They screwed me tonight, chef.

39:12.460 --> 39:13.527
That's a blatant lie.

39:13.595 --> 39:15.296
You are such a liar.

39:15.363 --> 39:17.131
<i>Excuse me, chef.
Zach is a liar!</i>

39:17.199 --> 39:20.400
Nobody touched any
of her risotto or any of that.

39:20.467 --> 39:24.838
It was everybody's fault
but Nedra's.

39:24.906 --> 39:27.507
Who is the weakest cook
in the blue team?

39:27.608 --> 39:29.209
I think Zach.
I get that.

39:29.277 --> 39:30.677
Nedra clearly, chef.

39:30.744 --> 39:33.113
I'm... I'm gonna have to hit Nedra
on that one there.

39:33.181 --> 39:34.147
You didn't speak up
when you needed to.

39:34.215 --> 39:35.548
<i>I did speak up.</i>

39:35.616 --> 39:38.117
I told Zach to get
the off of my station

39:38.185 --> 39:39.685
when he was sabotaging me.
That's not speaking up.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.187
Clearly...
Stop.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.322
I've had enough.

39:43.389 --> 39:46.158
Susan, Nedra, step forward.

39:49.395 --> 39:50.762
Susan.
Yes, chef?

39:50.831 --> 39:51.697
Why do you think you should stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:51.764 --> 39:53.064
You got 30 seconds.

39:53.132 --> 39:54.299
Yes, chef, I should stay
in Hell's Kitchen

39:54.366 --> 39:55.533
because I have come
leaps and bounds,

39:55.600 --> 39:57.401
<i>and I will continue to fight,</i>

39:57.469 --> 39:59.603
<i>grow, and be the best chef
that I can possibly be.</i>

39:59.671 --> 40:03.274
I will be the best chef
in Hell's Kitchen.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.544
Nedra, 30 seconds.

40:06.611 --> 40:08.411
I think I should stay, chef,

40:08.479 --> 40:10.247
<i>because last night,
I made a big decision</i>

40:10.315 --> 40:11.348
to go to the blue team.

40:11.415 --> 40:13.416
I stepped up and said
"I'll go,"

40:13.484 --> 40:15.219
because I feel like anything
in life,

40:15.286 --> 40:17.287
if it's given to you,
you don't appreciate it.

40:17.355 --> 40:18.989
So I'ma work for it,
and I'ma go to the blue team,

40:19.057 --> 40:20.324
and that's what I did.

40:20.391 --> 40:21.691
So I went to the blue team,

40:21.759 --> 40:23.727
and I'm fighting for it.

40:26.330 --> 40:30.967
The person
leaving Hell's Kitchen...

40:31.068 --> 40:32.168
Nedra.

40:32.236 --> 40:33.535
<i>Give me your jacket.</i>

40:33.603 --> 40:36.138
You fought hard,

40:36.206 --> 40:37.706
but Vegas
is not on the cards for you.

40:37.774 --> 40:38.941
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, chef.

40:39.009 --> 40:39.975
Good night.

40:40.042 --> 40:41.609
Bye, Nedra.

40:41.677 --> 40:43.478
Bye.

40:45.314 --> 40:47.315
Hell's Kitchen is
a roller coaster ride.

40:47.383 --> 40:48.750
You go from being nervous...

40:48.817 --> 40:51.953
Chef, can we pray
before you bust my balls?

40:52.021 --> 40:53.621
To mad...

40:53.689 --> 40:55.290
I got kicked
out the kitchen for you,

40:55.358 --> 40:56.223
so I'm not shutting
the up!

40:56.291 --> 40:57.591
To being happy...

40:57.658 --> 40:59.659
Yet again, congratulations
go to the red team.

41:01.696 --> 41:03.230
And mentally, it's crazy.

41:03.298 --> 41:04.198
Ooh!

41:04.266 --> 41:05.499
Nedra!

41:05.566 --> 41:07.601
Okay!
Stop calling my name!

41:07.668 --> 41:09.503
I made a couple of mistakes.

41:09.570 --> 41:11.905
Here you go, Nedra.
There's your six minutes.

41:11.972 --> 41:14.374
Take the tray!
There you go.

41:14.441 --> 41:16.075
But nobody can say,
"Oh, she didn't fight."

41:16.143 --> 41:18.477
Risotto, delicious.
Really delicious.

41:18.545 --> 41:19.612
Off you go.
Jacket on.

41:19.679 --> 41:20.613
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

41:20.680 --> 41:21.847
All my life, I had to fight.

41:21.916 --> 41:23.582
Even coming here, I had
to fight to come here,

41:23.650 --> 41:27.620
so I'm not gonna let
one thing defeat me.

41:27.687 --> 41:30.155
Susan, back in line.
Thank you, chef.

41:31.991 --> 41:32.958
I know many of you are dreaming

41:33.026 --> 41:34.793
about getting a black jacket,

41:34.860 --> 41:36.962
but if I was in your shoes,

41:37.030 --> 41:39.864
I'd be focusing
on getting one dinner service

41:39.933 --> 41:44.001
absolutely perfect.

41:44.069 --> 41:45.069
Get out of here.

41:45.137 --> 41:46.603
Good night, chef.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.605
Dingdong, the witch is dead!

41:48.673 --> 41:51.175
It feel good to have Nedra
out of Hell's Kitchen.

41:51.243 --> 41:53.477
How about that?

41:53.545 --> 41:56.047
I was absolutely thrown
under the bus tonight.

41:56.114 --> 41:58.950
I hope the red team feel
a little bit embarrassed

41:59.017 --> 42:00.350
of what they did to me tonight.

42:00.418 --> 42:05.021
I will not be the weakest chef
on the red team ever.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.391
Nedra wore a red jacket
and a blue jacket,

42:08.459 --> 42:10.160
but after tonight's performance,

42:10.227 --> 42:13.863
I knew that she wouldn't be
wearing a black jacket.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.668
<i>Next time
on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:19.735 --> 42:21.536
Chef Ramsay
announces a reward...

42:21.604 --> 42:24.005
The winner will be safe
from elimination.

42:24.073 --> 42:25.774
That pits chef against chef.

42:25.842 --> 42:26.875
I'ma kick ass.

42:26.943 --> 42:28.510
<i>Chef Zach is numero uno.</i>

42:28.578 --> 42:30.545
I am pumped
to beat the crap outta him.

42:30.613 --> 42:32.614
And with the
stakes higher than ever...

42:32.682 --> 42:34.349
Everything is riding on this.
Damn it.

42:34.416 --> 42:36.618
You won't believe
what one chef will do.

42:36.686 --> 42:39.020
Anthony, what the, man?
What did you do?

42:39.088 --> 42:39.987
I don't wanna
hear it from you.

42:40.054 --> 42:41.522
You lie about everything.

42:41.590 --> 42:43.557
I want bitch-ass Anthony
outta here.

42:43.625 --> 42:44.758
One thing is for sure...

42:44.826 --> 42:47.027
No way!
Come here, you.

42:47.095 --> 42:48.596
Chef Ramsay
is angrier than ever.

42:48.663 --> 42:49.563
I'm done.

42:49.631 --> 42:51.198
Hit him, chef. Hit him!

42:51.265 --> 42:52.432
Oh, my God.

42:52.501 --> 42:54.134
On an all new cutthroat...

42:54.202 --> 42:56.493
<i>Get a grip!
Hell's Kitchen.</i>
