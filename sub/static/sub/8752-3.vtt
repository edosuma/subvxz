00:11.044 --> 00:13.484
I don't know what this
dude's fully capable of.

00:13.485 --> 00:16.259
I have nightmares about this house.

00:16.260 --> 00:17.683
Aah! He's pissed off.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.540
All of their bodies were
burned beyond recognition.

00:20.541 --> 00:24.673
- Wow.
- Hates this person. Hates them.

00:24.674 --> 00:26.789
- I had an exorcism.
- An exorcism?

00:26.790 --> 00:29.929
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna kill you.

00:29.930 --> 00:33.385
I got to get away from this guy.

00:33.386 --> 00:35.255
It's really bad in here.

00:35.256 --> 00:38.181
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.182 --> 00:40.172
Something is not right.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.421
I see dead people.

00:41.422 --> 00:43.408
This person might have
been a serial killer.

00:43.409 --> 00:45.426
I speak to dead people.

00:45.427 --> 00:47.261
You get those chills.

00:47.262 --> 00:48.528
And they speak to me.

00:48.529 --> 00:51.064
He is darkness. He is evil.

00:51.065 --> 00:54.066
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.067 --> 00:55.659
I think she broke her neck.

00:55.660 --> 00:57.101
I rely on my partner.

00:57.102 --> 01:01.470
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:01.471 --> 01:02.905
You telling me the truth?

01:02.906 --> 01:06.040
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:06.041 --> 01:07.641
I think the Devil is down here.

01:07.642 --> 01:09.176
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.177 --> 01:10.661
Who the hell would do this?

01:10.662 --> 01:12.745
But Steve and I never speak...

01:12.746 --> 01:14.714
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:14.715 --> 01:16.048
Until the very end.

01:16.049 --> 01:17.450
Who's he looking to kill?

01:17.451 --> 01:19.418
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:19.419 --> 01:21.721
You need to get out of here right now.

01:21.722 --> 01:22.888
Or time to get out.

01:22.889 --> 01:26.489
It was like endless darkness.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:48.380 --> 01:52.940
Amy and I look into
each case separately.

01:52.951 --> 01:56.200
I interview living witnesses and
dig into the property's history,

01:56.201 --> 01:59.921
looking for dark secrets
buried in the past.

01:59.922 --> 02:03.427
While Amy communicates with the dead.

02:03.428 --> 02:07.604
I'm in Chicago, Illinois, on my
way to the house of a veteran cop.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.366
Thing is, he didn't call us in.

02:09.368 --> 02:11.284
His daughter, Cristina, did.

02:11.285 --> 02:14.748
She says the activity in the house is
so bad, she's afraid for his safety.

02:14.749 --> 02:18.933
But she also says that he's such a tough
guy, he is not gonna leave his home.

02:18.934 --> 02:23.374
I'm hoping Amy and I can help him out.

02:26.791 --> 02:31.540
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:31.541 --> 02:34.174
This home has a lot of
photographs, religious icons,

02:34.175 --> 02:39.755
and family heirlooms that
have to be covered or removed.

02:40.191 --> 02:46.091
When I'm finished, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

03:04.845 --> 03:06.988
I'm seeing this older woman.

03:06.989 --> 03:10.896
She said that somebody opened a door.

03:10.897 --> 03:13.262
And also is bringing dead
people home with them.

03:13.263 --> 03:16.683
And she wants it to stop.

03:20.436 --> 03:21.983
She says...

03:21.984 --> 03:25.975
"I'm not gonna waste any more time because
you're not gonna do anything to help me"...

03:25.976 --> 03:28.524
Just like the others.

03:28.525 --> 03:29.769
Uh...

03:29.770 --> 03:31.014
Ow!

03:31.015 --> 03:33.535
What's wrong?

03:50.253 --> 03:51.586
Oh, Cristina, I'm glad I'm here.

03:51.587 --> 03:54.420
You sounded a little worried on the
phone about all the stuff happening

03:54.421 --> 03:57.354
in the house here, and you're
concerned for your father, I understand.

03:57.355 --> 03:59.242
- Yes.
- But what about you?

03:59.243 --> 04:02.641
I've heard voices, footsteps...

04:02.642 --> 04:05.724
And I have nightmares about this house.

04:05.725 --> 04:09.510
I haven't lived here since I
was 18, and they still continue.

04:09.511 --> 04:10.721
Okay, like what?

04:10.722 --> 04:15.293
There was a boy, and he was trying
to force me to look at his head.

04:15.294 --> 04:18.834
And half his face was gone.

04:19.130 --> 04:21.499
Okay, so, you've been having
these dreams for a while.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.560
For years.

04:22.561 --> 04:25.300
Okay, so my question here is
why are you calling us in now?

04:25.301 --> 04:27.586
My daughter is only 3.

04:27.587 --> 04:31.064
And when she's staying
here, she's having...

04:31.065 --> 04:33.142
These kind of bad dreams.

04:33.143 --> 04:36.579
Cristina, the first person you mentioned
when we spoke on the phone was your father.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.244
And you sounded concerned
for him. What's the story?

04:39.245 --> 04:42.396
It's just my Dad and my stepmom,
Lori, here by themselves.

04:42.397 --> 04:44.341
I'm concerned about their safety.

04:44.342 --> 04:46.312
What are you looking
for us to do for you?

04:46.313 --> 04:50.083
I'm hoping that my nightmares will stop.

04:50.084 --> 04:53.228
That I'll be able to
bring my daughter here,

04:53.229 --> 04:58.989
and that my Dad and Lori will
be okay here by themselves.

05:02.805 --> 05:04.605
Ow.

05:05.214 --> 05:09.345
So, I look, and there's a guy who...

05:09.346 --> 05:12.166
Came from below...

05:12.210 --> 05:14.490
The house.

05:14.555 --> 05:18.941
He was punching me nonstop,
and he's got blood on him,

05:18.942 --> 05:22.713
like, dried-up blood, and
he told me I should leave.

05:22.714 --> 05:26.134
He's worried or something.

05:26.237 --> 05:30.737
Well, right down
there. Right down there.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.007
Mm.

05:34.507 --> 05:35.956
This male...

05:35.957 --> 05:37.301
This male...

05:37.302 --> 05:39.001
Hides...

05:39.002 --> 05:40.816
Down in here.

05:40.817 --> 05:44.297
He gets up in their space.

05:46.181 --> 05:52.081
There's someone standing, staring
at you. You know what I mean?

06:00.636 --> 06:04.607
This is the same room you
grew up in having nightmares.

06:04.608 --> 06:05.952
Yes, it is.

06:05.953 --> 06:08.480
Okay. What have you
experienced in the room?

06:08.481 --> 06:12.397
This is where I've seen the apparition.

06:12.398 --> 06:13.604
Of what?

06:13.605 --> 06:15.973
A woman dressed in white.

06:15.974 --> 06:20.320
And she was actually right
here in front of my closet door.

06:20.321 --> 06:23.180
- Okay, did you get a look at her face?
- No.

06:23.181 --> 06:25.715
Her back was to me.

06:25.716 --> 06:29.753
She was facing the door, and
then, she disappeared into it.

06:29.754 --> 06:31.915
Okay. You sure it wasn't a
dream or anything like that?

06:31.916 --> 06:34.736
I was wide awake.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.652
Oh, interesting.

06:49.574 --> 06:50.861
What's going on?

06:50.862 --> 06:53.234
- The older woman...
- Mm hmm.

06:53.235 --> 06:55.803
From outside likes to...

06:55.804 --> 06:58.198
Hide in the closet.

06:58.199 --> 07:01.619
And pop out like a witch.

07:01.965 --> 07:03.747
Is this something that people see?

07:03.748 --> 07:07.408
Yes. That's why she does it.

07:13.539 --> 07:16.482
So, Mark, obviously, we're here
because your daughter called us in.

07:16.483 --> 07:17.408
Mm-hmm.

07:17.409 --> 07:19.829
She's concerned for your
safety, as well as your wife.

07:19.830 --> 07:22.153
You got to be a little bit
worried yourself, I would think.

07:22.154 --> 07:23.583
Very worried.

07:23.584 --> 07:25.448
Now, do you know any
history about the house?

07:25.449 --> 07:30.380
A little bit. I know that a doctor lived
here, and he was a T.B. doctor in the area.

07:30.381 --> 07:31.848
- You're a cop.
- Yes.

07:31.849 --> 07:33.983
- And how long you been a cop?
- About 27 years.

07:33.984 --> 07:37.520
I'm sure you're like me. If you don't
see it or hear it, you don't believe it.

07:37.521 --> 07:38.768
Right.

07:38.769 --> 07:42.013
So, that being said, have
you had experiences here?

07:42.014 --> 07:43.936
I heard my name be called once.

07:43.937 --> 07:45.861
It sounded like my wife.

07:45.862 --> 07:48.363
It sounded just like her,
like something's mimicking her.

07:48.364 --> 07:50.125
- Was she home?
- No.

07:50.126 --> 07:52.493
I jumped up. I grabbed my
gun. I ran down the stairs.

07:52.494 --> 07:54.670
It did sound like
someone was in my home.

07:54.671 --> 07:56.445
- And nobody was?
- Nobody was there.

07:56.446 --> 07:58.653
Okay, have you ever experienced
anything else down here?

07:58.654 --> 08:02.119
I see what appears to be, like, a
black mass coming up the stairway.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.883
- Scared the heck out of me.
- It did, huh?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.480
- It's very frustrating.
- Right.

08:05.481 --> 08:09.114
It's hard to even accept it because
I can't prove it, and I can't...

08:09.115 --> 08:12.775
I really can't understand it.

08:18.626 --> 08:22.706
This is his preferred area in here.

08:23.199 --> 08:24.900
Aah! He's pissed off.

08:24.901 --> 08:28.270
He's angry. People
definitely see this guy.

08:28.271 --> 08:29.798
Ow.

08:29.799 --> 08:32.073
Aah. He hurts people.

08:32.073 --> 08:33.741
Ow!

08:33.743 --> 08:35.743
He's making my head hurt.

08:35.744 --> 08:36.910
Yeah.

08:36.912 --> 08:38.448
Ow!

08:38.450 --> 08:40.970
Knock it off.

08:47.896 --> 08:50.925
Okay, Mark, so, why'd you bring me here?

08:50.926 --> 08:53.695
I seen a male apparition
and a female apparition.

08:53.696 --> 08:55.456
Okay, describe the male for me.

08:55.457 --> 08:59.664
He had a suit on, I
recall, a tie, and glasses.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.960
- And you mentioned you saw a female, also.
- Yes, I did.

09:01.961 --> 09:05.298
She appeared to be a little older,
had longer hair, it looked gray to me.

09:05.299 --> 09:07.494
- Okay.
- And she was in some sort of dress.

09:07.495 --> 09:09.457
You know, on the phone,
your daughter mentioned

09:09.458 --> 09:12.137
something about inviting
other paranormal groups in.

09:12.138 --> 09:14.540
- We did recently.
- And?

09:14.541 --> 09:17.557
They definitely said that
there is something going on.

09:17.558 --> 09:21.217
Was that the only investigative team or
proactive thing you've done in the house?

09:21.218 --> 09:24.482
No. I had an exorcism of the house.

09:24.483 --> 09:26.366
- An exorcism?
- Yes.

09:26.367 --> 09:29.187
After the exorcism, did
anything improve at all?

09:29.188 --> 09:30.721
I don't believe it has.

09:30.722 --> 09:32.441
What are you hoping we can do for you?

09:32.442 --> 09:35.616
I know now that my daughter had a
hard time here, she had nightmares.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.536
- Yeah.
- Now I got grandkids.

09:37.537 --> 09:43.437
I don't want my grandkids to go
through what my kids went through.

09:46.268 --> 09:48.368
Oh, no.

09:49.630 --> 09:54.494
I got, like, weird, Voodoo,
seance stuff happening here.

09:54.495 --> 09:56.921
Somebody opened a [Bleep] door!

09:56.922 --> 09:59.334
Where dead people come.

09:59.335 --> 10:03.453
The old woman, she doesn't
like to come in here anymore.

10:03.454 --> 10:05.883
Because it's too um...

10:05.884 --> 10:08.292
Chaotic and hectic for her.

10:08.293 --> 10:13.564
And she wants her house back, so
she's getting really desperate.

10:13.565 --> 10:18.905
She said she swears to God
she's gonna poison them.

10:40.405 --> 10:42.525
So, Lori, I talked
to your husband, Mark.

10:42.526 --> 10:44.907
- Mm hmm.
- I talked to Cristina...

10:44.908 --> 10:50.808
And they explained the experiences they've
had and what's going on in the house.

10:50.856 --> 10:54.155
- What about yourself?
- I've had a few strange experiences.

10:54.156 --> 10:55.837
- Okay.
- And...

10:55.838 --> 11:00.508
One of them being one night I
thought Mark was home from work.

11:00.509 --> 11:02.003
- He used to work midnights.
- Okay.

11:02.004 --> 11:04.102
I heard footsteps coming up the stairs.

11:04.103 --> 11:06.674
I kind of, like, froze.

11:06.675 --> 11:11.210
And I never heard him come towards the
bedroom, so obviously, it wasn't him.

11:11.211 --> 11:13.446
- Okay, so, he wasn't home.
- He wasn't home.

11:13.447 --> 11:15.348
What about one of the other kids.

11:15.349 --> 11:17.595
It wasn't the other kids.
They were all in bed.

11:17.596 --> 11:21.376
So, that really freaked me out.

11:27.693 --> 11:30.753
I see these two men.

11:31.285 --> 11:33.701
Um, they have no skin.

11:33.702 --> 11:36.028
They're rotting and they like that.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.698
And they're tricksters.
They're tricksters.

11:38.699 --> 11:42.659
Those two men, they're tricksters.

11:46.329 --> 11:48.948
They look charred.

11:48.949 --> 11:53.509
I feel like they got
burned or something.

11:53.748 --> 11:56.917
And I hear roughhousing.

11:56.918 --> 12:01.298
You know, they're banging in the walls.

12:05.014 --> 12:06.915
Anything else going on up here?

12:06.916 --> 12:09.251
I don't feel comfortable in the dark.

12:09.252 --> 12:10.352
Why?

12:10.353 --> 12:15.156
Not too long ago, I went to bed one night,
and all of a sudden, in a sound sleep...

12:15.157 --> 12:18.827
I felt hands come up and grab my waist.

12:18.828 --> 12:21.797
And, like, I'm facing Mark,
so it couldn't have been him.

12:21.798 --> 12:24.505
- What did you do?
- I froze.

12:24.506 --> 12:27.953
I kind of, like, put the blankets up,
and I was afraid to move or say anything.

12:27.954 --> 12:30.085
Okay, so, you couldn't
mistake it for something else?

12:30.086 --> 12:31.139
No.

12:31.140 --> 12:34.289
Sounds like you were on
pins and needles living here.

12:34.290 --> 12:35.227
Yeah.

12:35.228 --> 12:37.045
Now I'm a little more
nervous of going to bed.

12:37.046 --> 12:42.946
If I wake up in the middle of the night,
I'm afraid to, like, open my eyes or move.

12:47.555 --> 12:49.415
Bad.

12:51.227 --> 12:54.467
Lots of physical [Bleep]

12:54.994 --> 12:57.454
He's like...

12:59.703 --> 13:03.205
Beating on somebody in the bed.

13:03.206 --> 13:04.819
He hates them.

13:04.820 --> 13:06.904
Ah! Hates this person.

13:06.905 --> 13:09.115
- Hates them.
- Why?

13:09.116 --> 13:12.141
They're messing with his stuff.

13:12.142 --> 13:14.755
Messing with his life.

13:14.756 --> 13:17.825
- And this is a living person?
- Yes.

13:17.826 --> 13:23.726
He's, like, up in their ear, and
he's like, I'm gonna kill you.

13:23.966 --> 13:28.406
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna kill you.

13:28.937 --> 13:32.336
Just as I'm seeing what this
angry man can do to the living,

13:32.337 --> 13:34.664
he turns his attention back on me.

13:34.665 --> 13:40.565
He wants me out of this house, and
he has disturbing ways of showing it.

13:40.870 --> 13:43.630
He is a [Bleep]!

13:45.476 --> 13:47.677
[Bleep] Damn it.

13:47.678 --> 13:50.314
I got to get away from this guy.

13:50.315 --> 13:52.156
He's really hurting me.

13:52.157 --> 13:54.813
He's really hurting me.

13:54.814 --> 13:58.414
He's very excited that um...

13:58.432 --> 14:03.172
He can jump people or
get inside of people.

14:03.655 --> 14:09.535
His energy is extremely
uncomfortable, like terrible, terrible.

14:10.856 --> 14:16.756
I got scared because I thought, I don't
know what this dude's fully capable of.

14:31.058 --> 14:35.337
Mark told me his house used to be
a doctor's office for T.B. patients.

14:35.338 --> 14:38.965
So I made some calls around
town, and his story checks out.

14:38.966 --> 14:44.866
But the historian I contacted says there's
a lot more to the story than Mark realizes.

14:51.077 --> 14:52.891
So, it turns out that
my client was right,

14:52.892 --> 14:55.537
that the house was occupied
by a doctor at one time.

14:55.538 --> 14:57.271
Yeah, Dr. George Gindele.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.073
Can you tell me a little bit about him?

14:59.074 --> 15:02.777
Well, he was a general practice doctor.

15:02.778 --> 15:06.891
There wasn't a lot of money in
medicine, and he had, like, 10 children,

15:06.892 --> 15:10.185
so they had to start
various other businesses.

15:10.186 --> 15:13.731
They opened up a candy store. They
had a newsstand that they operated.

15:13.732 --> 15:16.891
Okay, and he did treat
T.B. patients in the house?

15:16.892 --> 15:18.942
Yes, he did.

15:18.943 --> 15:22.169
This guy sounds like he
put a lot on his plate.

15:22.170 --> 15:24.322
He had a house with 10 kids
he was trying to raise...

15:24.323 --> 15:25.166
Yeah.

15:25.167 --> 15:26.909
His own practice,
several other businesses,

15:26.910 --> 15:30.374
plus, he's treating a very
contagious disease in his own home.

15:30.375 --> 15:36.195
Right. He must have been
terribly stressed out in his life.

15:39.236 --> 15:41.052
That hurt.

15:41.053 --> 15:45.313
But I know what he [Bleep]
looks like now to me.

15:45.314 --> 15:48.040
Even though the angry
man violently attacked me,

15:48.041 --> 15:50.469
he revealed himself to
me for just a second.

15:50.470 --> 15:53.581
And I was able to get a glimpse
of what he looked like in life.

15:53.582 --> 15:56.603
Very professional field.

15:56.604 --> 16:00.504
Dark-brown hair, average
build, as far as I can tell.

16:00.505 --> 16:03.805
He does have a coat on.

16:09.603 --> 16:14.283
He had a very, very
[Bleep] stressful life.

16:14.607 --> 16:18.447
Very [Bleep] stressed about work.

16:18.886 --> 16:22.186
High stakes. High stakes.

16:24.127 --> 16:26.744
Now, you had mentioned that he
had some tragedy in his life.

16:26.745 --> 16:31.829
Yeah. Some years before, a couple of his
sons were going through an apple orchard.

16:31.830 --> 16:36.324
Nearby the property, and this man suddenly
appears, and he starts yelling at them

16:36.325 --> 16:38.935
in German, telling them to
get out of the apple orchard.

16:38.936 --> 16:41.293
And he takes out a
shotgun full of buckshot,

16:41.294 --> 16:43.479
and he starts firing them at the kids.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.778
And one of the sons got hit in the leg.

16:45.779 --> 16:49.027
And the oldest son,
George, got hit in the face.

16:49.028 --> 16:53.512
And he didn't die, but it
disfigured him horribly.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.130
I've seen shotgun victims before.

16:55.131 --> 16:57.252
How bad was his face?

16:57.253 --> 17:01.211
Well, George Jr. was hit 35
times in the face and the neck.

17:01.212 --> 17:04.872
So it was obviously very bad.

17:08.931 --> 17:10.398
You all right?

17:10.400 --> 17:14.540
There's a lot of pain in his head.

17:19.050 --> 17:22.778
He had a destination. There was
some kind of meeting with men.

17:22.779 --> 17:26.679
And then, I see trees around me.

17:26.945 --> 17:29.618
That's when things get sketchy.

17:29.619 --> 17:33.219
But then, he came back here.

17:33.756 --> 17:36.625
So, now you got this poor kid
shot in the face. He's disfigured.

17:36.626 --> 17:39.228
- Whatever wound up happening to him?
- It's a tragedy.

17:39.229 --> 17:43.009
About eight years later, 1926...

17:43.093 --> 17:47.252
The doctor gets a house call, and he
decides to take George out with him.

17:47.253 --> 17:49.592
And it's pretty snowy
for that time of year.

17:49.593 --> 17:52.508
And the house call is
around the Des Plaines River.

17:52.509 --> 17:55.920
And the doctor parks his car,
goes off on his house call...

17:55.921 --> 17:58.674
And he leaves young George behind.

17:58.675 --> 18:00.931
George got out of the car
evidently, and he went and he

18:00.932 --> 18:03.814
sat on the edge of the bridge
looking down at the river.

18:03.815 --> 18:06.788
Meantime, Dr. Gindele comes
back, and the kid's missing.

18:06.789 --> 18:09.160
He doesn't know what
happened to him so...

18:09.161 --> 18:12.926
He goes back home and files
a missing-person report.

18:12.927 --> 18:16.806
They finally found his body a
couple weeks later downstream.

18:16.807 --> 18:20.568
A few miles from where he had
evidently gone into the river.

18:20.569 --> 18:22.894
Okay. So, did they
have a cause of death?

18:22.895 --> 18:27.675
Well, they brought the
body in for an autopsy.

18:27.676 --> 18:30.478
And that's the death certificate.

18:30.479 --> 18:32.479
He drowned, and they're
saying it's accidental.

18:32.480 --> 18:33.547
Right.

18:33.548 --> 18:36.667
- This had to devastate him.
- Oh, it had to.

18:36.668 --> 18:41.768
And it just broke him
up. It just destroyed him.

18:45.159 --> 18:46.326
This guy, he fell down.

18:46.327 --> 18:52.227
He slipped on the ice, and maybe he kind
of snapped a little when... you know?

18:52.603 --> 18:55.301
Because he's not dealing with it.

18:55.302 --> 19:00.072
I think it's just because
his brain is... he's confused.

19:00.073 --> 19:04.747
It triggered his pain,
and he got really angry.

19:04.748 --> 19:07.628
Uh, pretty quickly.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.490
I want to know what happened to Dr.
Gindele after the death of his son.

19:24.491 --> 19:29.309
For me, the best source of
information is from a family member.

19:29.310 --> 19:31.330
I've managed to track down
one of his descendants,

19:31.331 --> 19:36.431
who says the tragedy
destroyed the doctor's life.

19:44.007 --> 19:46.380
Now, Jack, I know you're a
descendant of Dr. Gindele.

19:46.381 --> 19:48.312
But what was your actual
relationship to him?

19:48.313 --> 19:50.574
- He was my grandfather.
- Okay.

19:50.575 --> 19:55.486
And this is a picture of Dr.
Gindele and his oldest son George.

19:55.487 --> 19:58.100
- This was taken before he was shot?
- Yes.

19:58.101 --> 20:00.882
You know, Jack, one of the reasons
I actually wanted to meet with you

20:00.883 --> 20:05.242
is because I wanted to find out what
happened to the doctor after his son died.

20:05.243 --> 20:11.143
He had a nervous breakdown, and as a
result, he stopped practicing medicine.

20:11.464 --> 20:15.724
My understanding is that Dr.
Gindele was of such a state of mind

20:15.725 --> 20:19.690
that he went to live in Oak
Park with one of his sisters.

20:19.691 --> 20:24.637
And my Grandmother stayed in
the house with the children.

20:24.638 --> 20:27.373
So, he just left them there?

20:27.374 --> 20:28.606
Well...

20:28.607 --> 20:30.767
Uh, yes.

20:31.622 --> 20:34.692
I got to figure your Grandmother
had it pretty tough then.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.553
Yes.

20:38.515 --> 20:40.550
How old was the doctor when he died?

20:40.551 --> 20:43.476
- Uh, 75.
- 75, okay.

20:43.477 --> 20:45.589
And how old was your
Grandmother when she passed?

20:45.590 --> 20:47.727
- In her 80s.
- Oh, she was an elderly woman.

20:47.728 --> 20:50.608
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

20:57.999 --> 21:01.239
I feel very tired here.

21:01.923 --> 21:03.963
Just...

21:04.963 --> 21:06.418
Worn out.

21:06.419 --> 21:08.639
Worn out.

21:10.038 --> 21:12.279
This might be that old lady.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.517
- Okay.
- But something...

21:15.518 --> 21:17.738
Is not...

21:17.861 --> 21:19.596
Right.

21:19.597 --> 21:23.077
What are you talking about?

21:24.546 --> 21:29.106
Something about their
family, it's broken.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.942
She felt really lonely...

21:32.943 --> 21:35.103
Confused.

21:36.948 --> 21:39.516
I don't like it.

21:39.517 --> 21:43.357
It's a little [Bleep] unnerving.

21:49.143 --> 21:50.901
I'm at the local library to see what

21:50.902 --> 21:55.422
else I can uncover about
my client's property.

21:55.423 --> 22:00.767
Digging through the archives, I discover
that a poor farm operated right next door.

22:00.768 --> 22:05.082
And according to the headlines,
the conditions there were terrible.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.843
So I've reached out to a local reporter,

22:06.844 --> 22:12.744
who tells me that the tragedies that
took place there are unthinkable.

22:19.052 --> 22:23.238
The Cook County poor farm is
one of the dirty secrets...

22:23.239 --> 22:25.434
In Chicago history.

22:25.435 --> 22:30.088
The conditions there
were absolutely appalling.

22:30.089 --> 22:34.110
This was where they sent people,
basically, to be forgotten.

22:34.111 --> 22:39.930
And as you can see from this picture,
this is a fairly large institution.

22:39.931 --> 22:43.190
What kind of people would
have been on this poor farm?

22:43.191 --> 22:45.760
Quite a variety. There
were mental patients...

22:45.761 --> 22:49.669
There were indigents, and
there were tubercular patients.

22:49.670 --> 22:52.462
Pat, you mentioned on the phone
that there was a tragedy on the farm.

22:52.463 --> 22:53.713
What was it?

22:53.714 --> 22:58.063
In 1923, the main building
of the mental institution...

22:58.064 --> 23:00.817
- Okay.
- Burned down.

23:00.818 --> 23:04.898
And at least 17 people were killed.

23:05.156 --> 23:08.150
All of their bodies were
burned beyond recognition.

23:08.151 --> 23:09.241
Wow.

23:09.242 --> 23:14.942
And as you can see, the
destruction was pretty widespread.

23:14.963 --> 23:20.863
As a matter of fact, most of the people
who died there ended up being buried there.

23:21.577 --> 23:24.441
You mean people who died there
before and after the fire?

23:24.442 --> 23:25.460
Yes.

23:25.461 --> 23:28.686
And what's the estimate of how many people
are actually buried on that property?

23:28.687 --> 23:31.881
Conservatively, 38,000 people.

23:31.882 --> 23:33.742
Wow.

23:39.923 --> 23:44.135
During my walk, I got a quick glimpse
of the angry man who attacked me.

23:44.136 --> 23:46.571
So I'm meeting with a
sketch artist to draw him.

23:46.572 --> 23:50.868
His hair was very thick but cut short.

23:50.869 --> 23:54.133
And kind of a longer chin.

23:54.134 --> 23:55.580
How about his eyes?

23:55.581 --> 23:57.630
Almond-shaped.

23:57.631 --> 24:01.897
Next, I described a horrifying
scene in the upstairs bedroom.

24:01.898 --> 24:07.798
There's a woman in the bed, and
I saw him, like, beating on her.

24:09.255 --> 24:12.746
I'd have his left hand holding her arm.

24:12.747 --> 24:17.127
And his right hand in a fist over her.

24:23.644 --> 24:26.764
Is this what you saw?

24:28.879 --> 24:30.739
Yes.

24:53.991 --> 24:56.573
Now that Amy and I have
completed our own investigations.

24:56.574 --> 25:01.929
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

25:01.930 --> 25:03.497
Amy, I want you to meet Mark.

25:03.498 --> 25:05.932
He's a cop, and he's
been a cop for 27 years.

25:05.933 --> 25:08.436
This is his wife, Lori,
and his daughter, Cristina.

25:08.437 --> 25:11.257
Now, Cristina's actually
the one who called us in.

25:11.258 --> 25:13.003
But she doesn't live here anymore.

25:13.004 --> 25:16.667
Even though she doesn't live here, she's
still getting tormented by nightmares.

25:16.668 --> 25:19.087
Now she has a
3- year-old daughter...

25:19.088 --> 25:22.009
Who's having similar dreams, and
she's getting very concerned about it.

25:22.010 --> 25:25.102
These two live here, and they're
being tormented by the activity.

25:25.103 --> 25:30.275
And they want to get their life back in
order and make this a safe place to live.

25:30.276 --> 25:32.960
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

25:32.961 --> 25:35.443
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

25:35.444 --> 25:38.852
So, I encountered two men.

25:38.853 --> 25:42.471
And they didn't have any skin.

25:42.472 --> 25:47.272
They were kind of like
mushy-looking corpses.

25:47.988 --> 25:53.388
They were a little charred
like they had been burned.

25:53.627 --> 25:57.636
Upstairs in the hallway in
particular, they like to horse around.

25:57.637 --> 25:59.637
They're kind of acting crazy.

25:59.638 --> 26:03.929
You'd hear the scuffling
feet in that hallway.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.518
Now, you guys hear footsteps
all the time upstairs.

26:06.519 --> 26:08.321
- Yeah.
- Correct.

26:08.322 --> 26:11.044
I would think it was Mark
coming home from work.

26:11.045 --> 26:12.779
And I would hear footsteps.

26:12.780 --> 26:16.967
Well, this particular night, I
heard the footsteps coming up...

26:16.968 --> 26:20.370
And I waited for him, you know,
to come back to, like, the bedroom,

26:20.371 --> 26:23.221
and he never came back,
meaning it wasn't him.

26:23.222 --> 26:24.755
Right.

26:24.756 --> 26:27.758
Now, you mentioned these guys
looked like they were burned?

26:27.759 --> 26:29.592
They got burned in a fire.

26:29.593 --> 26:34.399
That's interesting you say that because in
the late 1800s, less than a mile from here.

26:34.400 --> 26:39.098
Adjacent to the property was
the Cook County poor farm.

26:39.099 --> 26:42.181
The complex housed poor people...

26:42.182 --> 26:46.438
Had an insane asylum on it, and it had
a Sanitarium for Tuberculosis patients.

26:46.439 --> 26:47.913
Wow.

26:47.914 --> 26:51.503
1923, the insane asylum
burns down to the ground.

26:51.504 --> 26:52.848
Oh.

26:52.849 --> 26:54.310
17 people burn to death.

26:54.311 --> 26:55.636
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, wow.

26:55.637 --> 26:59.957
Now, this is a photo of the aftermath.

27:00.260 --> 27:03.354
People that went there, they died
there, and they were buried there.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.680
Could be as high as 38,000.

27:05.681 --> 27:07.454
What?

27:07.455 --> 27:08.997
- Right here?
- Right here.

27:08.998 --> 27:11.956
Now, do you think these
guys came from that fire?

27:11.957 --> 27:13.817
Yes.

27:16.643 --> 27:18.161
What else did you see?

27:18.162 --> 27:22.422
I encountered this older woman outside.

27:22.552 --> 27:26.045
And she was just spewing hate.

27:26.046 --> 27:29.119
She felt very alone and confused.

27:29.120 --> 27:32.204
And was really, really tired.

27:32.205 --> 27:36.437
One of the things that
she likes to do is...

27:36.438 --> 27:39.161
Come out of the closets.

27:39.162 --> 27:42.746
She's trying to assert
her dominance that way.

27:42.747 --> 27:46.387
I saw the figure of a woman...

27:46.388 --> 27:50.566
Upstairs in my bedroom
facing the closet.

27:50.567 --> 27:53.401
And she disappeared into it.

27:53.402 --> 27:56.440
I saw an apparition of a woman.

27:56.441 --> 28:00.026
I could only see her from the back because
she was sitting on the edge of the bed.

28:00.027 --> 28:03.659
The edge of the bed is
right next to the closet.

28:03.660 --> 28:06.895
Let me ask. What is she pissed about?

28:06.896 --> 28:10.196
She doesn't feel like...

28:10.397 --> 28:13.197
This is her space anymore.

28:13.198 --> 28:18.013
Because there was something about
seances and someone opening a door.

28:18.014 --> 28:20.943
And she's getting desperate.

28:20.944 --> 28:23.717
No one's listening,
and she swears to God,

28:23.718 --> 28:26.951
if it continues she
wants to poison you guys.

28:26.952 --> 28:29.699
Like, she wants to poison you.

28:29.700 --> 28:32.456
- They did have a ghost group...
- Okay.

28:32.457 --> 28:34.368
Of paranormal investigators come in.

28:34.369 --> 28:38.926
Not only that, but they had a priest
perform an exorcism in the house.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.920
- We did.
- Of the house?

28:40.921 --> 28:42.410
Of the house.

28:42.411 --> 28:44.845
This is where we
started the ritual here.

28:44.846 --> 28:47.448
And he said that he was
chasing whatever it was

28:47.449 --> 28:50.435
throughout the house
down into the basement.

28:50.436 --> 28:52.856
While he was in the basement...

28:52.857 --> 28:56.030
He's saying the final prayers and...

28:56.031 --> 28:59.448
The stole got pulled off of his
shoulders and thrown to the floor.

28:59.449 --> 29:01.584
Oh!

29:01.585 --> 29:03.453
Now...

29:03.454 --> 29:07.861
Is the woman pissed off because of
maybe the exorcism or all of the above?

29:07.862 --> 29:09.879
I think it's all of the above.

29:09.880 --> 29:13.160
I'm a little concerned about your saying
that she was going to poison the people.

29:13.161 --> 29:15.610
- Mm hmm.
- Is she capable of that?

29:15.611 --> 29:17.471
Yes.

29:17.624 --> 29:20.573
This woman's so advanced she's
able to persuade the living

29:20.574 --> 29:25.364
into harming themselves, and
she plans to do it with poison.

29:25.365 --> 29:27.352
I got to protect my family.

29:27.353 --> 29:32.701
This is not something that's
gonna obviously fly here.

29:32.702 --> 29:35.052
What else did you see?

29:35.053 --> 29:37.821
I'm outside, and I meet this guy.

29:37.822 --> 29:40.850
He was trying to get me out of here.

29:40.851 --> 29:45.402
He just didn't want me to
find anything out about him.

29:45.403 --> 29:50.306
Definitely the most powerful
entity that's in this house.

29:50.307 --> 29:52.937
Aah! He's pissed off. He's angry.

29:52.938 --> 29:55.258
People definitely see this guy.

29:55.259 --> 29:56.669
Ow.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.617
Aah. He hurts people.

29:59.618 --> 30:01.895
He looked very professional.

30:01.896 --> 30:03.615
He was...

30:03.616 --> 30:05.646
Obsessed with his work.

30:05.647 --> 30:08.459
Extremely stressed-out man.

30:08.460 --> 30:11.658
And he was extremely good
at whatever it was he did.

30:11.659 --> 30:15.205
But it was high-stress and high stakes.

30:15.206 --> 30:19.839
I'm not sure if this is the guy
you saw, but it sounds like him.

30:19.840 --> 30:24.762
This house was occupied by a guy
by the name of Dr. George Gindele.

30:24.763 --> 30:27.797
And he worked out of
the house, this house.

30:27.798 --> 30:31.326
Um, starting in, I think, 1920.

30:31.327 --> 30:33.798
He was a workaholic, this guy.

30:33.799 --> 30:38.553
Back during that time period, Chicago
had a big Tuberculosis outbreak.

30:38.554 --> 30:43.823
He treated a lot of those
patients right here in the house.

30:43.824 --> 30:46.863
And he had 10 kids here.

30:46.864 --> 30:49.296
That's a lot of stress.

30:49.297 --> 30:55.197
I'm just curious if this could
possibly be the guy you saw.

31:00.683 --> 31:04.163
I did do a sketch of him.

31:09.370 --> 31:13.990
Well, you guys take
a look at the sketch.

31:17.780 --> 31:19.089
Wow.

31:19.090 --> 31:21.670
Wow, is right.

31:22.061 --> 31:24.165
That's the apparition I saw.

31:24.166 --> 31:26.878
100% definitely, that's the guy I saw.

31:26.879 --> 31:28.701
Oh, my God.

31:28.702 --> 31:33.229
If you imagine a mustache right here,
it really does look just like him.

31:33.230 --> 31:35.401
I don't like the fact that...

31:35.402 --> 31:38.955
He's here doing what he's doing
because I'd figure if he was a doctor,

31:38.956 --> 31:42.736
he would be helping people,
not causing problems.

31:42.737 --> 31:44.921
And did you get anything
else from this guy?

31:44.922 --> 31:48.100
He had had two big
accidents during his life.

31:48.101 --> 31:52.841
The first one I saw
was he slipped on ice.

31:53.034 --> 31:58.636
The other one I saw, like, he
was walking to meet some men...

31:58.637 --> 32:01.504
And then, something
really, really bad happened.

32:01.505 --> 32:06.451
He was all bloody, and there was
something wrong with his eyes.

32:06.452 --> 32:10.808
I have nothing that says Dr.
Gindele had any accidents but...

32:10.809 --> 32:14.782
There were two events in his
life that basically destroyed him.

32:14.783 --> 32:20.683
I actually have a picture of him and
his son, who he was very close to.

32:21.893 --> 32:24.692
This is the doctor, and
this is his son, George Jr.

32:24.693 --> 32:28.205
George Jr. was about 20 years old, and
he was walking through the neighbor's,

32:28.206 --> 32:30.333
farm the apple orchard.

32:30.334 --> 32:33.168
And the guy that lived on the
farm decided to take a shot at him.

32:33.169 --> 32:34.402
What?

32:34.403 --> 32:36.671
Shot him in the face and neck.

32:36.672 --> 32:40.152
So this kid was disfigured.

32:42.610 --> 32:44.830
My dream.

32:46.744 --> 32:50.096
I had a nightmare one
night, and there was

32:50.097 --> 32:55.129
a boy who looked like
he was in his late teens.

32:55.130 --> 33:00.860
And it looked like he had been shot in the
head because half of his face was missing.

33:00.861 --> 33:05.841
And he kept trying to
force me to look at it.

33:06.801 --> 33:12.701
Because I have nightmares all the
time that are connected to this house.

33:40.970 --> 33:46.870
I have nightmares all the time
that are connected to this house.

33:59.589 --> 34:01.618
This is...

34:01.619 --> 34:03.703
Hard for me to take.

34:03.704 --> 34:06.625
You guys thought I was crazy.

34:06.626 --> 34:11.534
I never even heard that, honey.
I didn't even know that happened.

34:11.534 --> 34:13.036
She'll be all right.

34:13.038 --> 34:16.398
Hopefully, this helps her.

34:22.495 --> 34:26.155
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

34:28.052 --> 34:31.589
Starting to make sense to you
now, though, a little? Yeah?

34:31.590 --> 34:36.540
Now, this poor kid, George Jr., was
badly disfigured from this shooting.

34:36.541 --> 34:39.330
Now, you mentioned falling into
the ice or falling on the ice.

34:39.331 --> 34:43.531
George Jr., in April of 1926, fell...

34:44.114 --> 34:48.237
Accidentally or he jumped
into the Des Plaines River.

34:48.239 --> 34:51.766
And I have his death certificate.

34:51.768 --> 34:57.571
Right here basically, you'll see,
it just says accidental drowning.

34:57.572 --> 35:03.077
This eventually destroyed Dr. Gindele
because he gave up his medical practice.

35:03.078 --> 35:07.225
He moved out of his house, left
his wife with the nine kids...

35:07.226 --> 35:08.078
What?

35:08.079 --> 35:11.885
Moved in with his sister,
and left her here alone.

35:11.886 --> 35:15.125
Now, she stayed here
until she died in 1960.

35:15.126 --> 35:17.892
This is his wife, Julia.

35:17.893 --> 35:20.353
Oh, my gosh.

35:21.064 --> 35:23.195
Could this be the woman you saw?

35:23.196 --> 35:24.257
Yes.

35:24.258 --> 35:26.531
Now, could this possibly
be the guy you saw?

35:26.532 --> 35:30.192
- I think so.
- Oh, my gosh.

35:30.726 --> 35:35.226
The main areas that he likes to be in...

35:35.266 --> 35:39.718
Is the basement and then
the front room upstairs.

35:39.719 --> 35:41.877
Would that be causing her nightmares?

35:41.878 --> 35:44.731
I mean, it seems like they're... yeah.

35:44.732 --> 35:49.053
With him, you'd experience him in
a lot of, you know, different ways.

35:49.054 --> 35:52.767
Anyways, you might hear,
you know, things in your ears

35:52.768 --> 35:55.391
making threats, touching people.

35:55.392 --> 35:58.998
Most of the stuff he
does is in the dark.

35:58.999 --> 36:01.508
I am very afraid of the dark.

36:01.509 --> 36:05.805
And at night, there will be times
where I wake up in my sleep...

36:05.806 --> 36:08.184
And I won't even open my eyes.

36:08.185 --> 36:10.553
I'll just pray that I fall back asleep.

36:10.554 --> 36:12.056
Why do you wake up?

36:12.057 --> 36:15.025
- I don't know why I wake up.
- Huh.

36:15.026 --> 36:20.176
I did do another sketch
of something that he does.

36:20.177 --> 36:23.912
And it was in the main bedroom.

36:23.913 --> 36:29.313
And he was getting physical
with a woman in the bed.

36:36.613 --> 36:41.053
Well, I have to show this to you, so...

36:43.642 --> 36:45.689
That's really freaky.

36:45.690 --> 36:48.570
He's touching you.

36:48.652 --> 36:51.828
Why don't you just explain
to Amy what you told me?

36:51.829 --> 36:56.158
Well, not too long ago, I
was in a sound sleep, and...

36:56.159 --> 37:00.537
I woke up because I felt
somebody grabbing my waist.

37:00.538 --> 37:02.205
And I could feel the fingers.

37:02.206 --> 37:06.742
But when I woke up, I did open
my eyes, and I was facing Mark.

37:06.743 --> 37:09.287
So, my back would have
been towards the closet.

37:09.288 --> 37:11.932
So, it couldn't have
been him touching me.

37:11.933 --> 37:13.739
I'm getting angry.

37:13.740 --> 37:16.859
Because this isn't his
house anymore. It's my house.

37:16.860 --> 37:20.948
I'm going to tell you what
I believe is going on here.

37:20.949 --> 37:26.727
After hearing everything, I kind of feel
like I was being a little too hard on him.

37:26.728 --> 37:28.492
It's a heartbreaking story.

37:28.493 --> 37:33.640
The woman, she's always been
here. I mean, she never left.

37:33.641 --> 37:36.576
I think that what...

37:36.577 --> 37:39.302
May have happened here is that...

37:39.303 --> 37:41.945
He was probably pulled
back to the house.

37:41.946 --> 37:45.314
When you had paranormal groups
come in and try to contact the dead.

37:45.315 --> 37:50.535
It probably pulled him
back here from the darkness.

37:51.815 --> 37:53.948
This is the place he ran from in life...

37:53.949 --> 37:56.837
Too many memories, too much pain.

37:56.838 --> 38:01.575
He's reliving it over
and over and over again.

38:01.576 --> 38:06.730
I think he's angry at you
because you called him back here.

38:06.731 --> 38:11.051
I think he's lashing out because
he wants to make you suffer, too.

38:11.052 --> 38:16.089
He really can't leave now because
he's just in the thick of this chaos.

38:16.090 --> 38:18.894
So, he's not able to leave on
his own, even if he wanted to.

38:18.895 --> 38:20.995
Exactly.

38:21.462 --> 38:24.695
So, when you saw the accidents
involving the ice and the blood,

38:24.696 --> 38:27.534
was that him reliving
his son's accidents?

38:27.535 --> 38:30.851
I think so. It's a very, very sad thing.

38:30.852 --> 38:33.582
It is sad, and on the
same... I feel bad for him.

38:33.583 --> 38:35.367
And on the other hand, I'm mad.

38:35.368 --> 38:38.424
- Well, look what he's doing to your wife.
- That's the part I'm mad about.

38:38.425 --> 38:42.025
And what he did to my kids.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.160
I know you guys got overwhelmed
with a lot of information tonight,

38:48.161 --> 38:50.016
and I'm sure it's not
what you wanted to hear.

38:50.017 --> 38:52.625
But the big question is can you
live here without all the torment?

38:52.626 --> 38:54.835
And can you go on without
having these nightmares

38:54.836 --> 38:57.538
and protect your 3-year-old
from having the same issues?

38:57.539 --> 38:58.942
I don't have an answer for that,

38:58.943 --> 39:03.769
but I'm gonna turn it over to
Amy, and hopefully, she will.

39:03.770 --> 39:05.569
It's going to sound unusual.

39:05.570 --> 39:09.794
The first thing would be to
get a clinical psychologist.

39:09.795 --> 39:13.078
Who practices providing therapy.

39:13.079 --> 39:14.913
These are his conditions.

39:14.914 --> 39:17.032
What do you mean his conditions?

39:17.033 --> 39:19.413
- He's asking for this?
- Yes.

39:19.414 --> 39:23.074
Earlier, we made a compromise.

39:23.293 --> 39:25.524
This actually happens quite often.

39:25.525 --> 39:28.890
When I got to the house for the
reveal, the angry man approached me,

39:28.891 --> 39:32.453
and we worked out a deal
to help him to move on.

39:32.454 --> 39:33.787
He needs to focus...

39:33.788 --> 39:35.925
He needs to focus...

39:35.926 --> 39:38.268
On talking out his life.

39:38.269 --> 39:39.889
On talking out his life.

39:39.890 --> 39:42.609
Because right now he's living in chaos.

39:42.610 --> 39:46.903
So, we want to give him a
little bit of time to process.

39:46.904 --> 39:50.627
And hopefully, he'll just
leave after that anyways.

39:50.628 --> 39:54.820
The second thing is you need
to bring in a chaos magician.

39:54.821 --> 39:57.613
What the hell exactly
is a chaos magician?

39:57.614 --> 40:01.583
A chaos magician is an individual who...

40:01.584 --> 40:05.184
Follows the philosophy that...

40:05.475 --> 40:09.685
The Universe and the Earth and
everything is functioning within chaos.

40:09.686 --> 40:12.805
So they utilize that
chaos within their magic.

40:12.806 --> 40:16.055
So, when the chaos magician comes
in, that'll get rid of the old lady,

40:16.056 --> 40:20.778
the two burn victims, and Dr. Gindele,
too, if he doesn't leave on his own?

40:20.779 --> 40:21.938
Yes.

40:21.939 --> 40:24.280
What of Cristina's nightmares at home?

40:24.281 --> 40:26.820
Because she's having them
not here but at her house.

40:26.821 --> 40:28.423
Right.

40:28.424 --> 40:31.049
How do we fix that, or can it be fixed?

40:31.050 --> 40:35.505
When you wake up, you need to
tell them, you get out of my house.

40:35.506 --> 40:38.508
You leave me alone. You
leave my daughter alone.

40:38.509 --> 40:40.762
Will it affect her daughter?

40:40.763 --> 40:43.679
Well, that remains to be seen.

40:43.680 --> 40:46.309
- She's only having stuff here, right?
- Right, yeah.

40:46.310 --> 40:49.287
Yeah. So, you know, they're
gonna do all these steps,

40:49.288 --> 40:50.906
and the house is gonna be locked down.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.191
So, then, she'll be
fine to come over here.

40:53.192 --> 40:54.659
Are you gonna do what Amy suggests?

40:54.660 --> 40:56.794
I'll do my best, but that
psychologist isn't for us.

40:56.795 --> 40:58.696
I got enough people in the house.

40:58.697 --> 41:01.299
Even if we do the other
steps, he'll have to leave.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.571
We'll force him to leave.

41:03.572 --> 41:06.703
- Are you seriously gonna do that?
- I don't know.

41:06.704 --> 41:10.974
Hey, you got to take some responsibility
here, he did not want to be here.

41:10.975 --> 41:13.912
It's just the negotiation part
that I have a problem with.

41:13.913 --> 41:19.813
I'm upset, too, you know? This guy
beat the [Bleep] out of me for hours.

41:19.891 --> 41:24.631
I think that you should
go with what Amy...

41:24.645 --> 41:25.906
Is saying.

41:25.907 --> 41:29.722
And it's just that, you know,
as extreme as it is for Lori,

41:29.723 --> 41:34.036
if it gets it all to stop,
then swallow your pride, and...

41:34.037 --> 41:38.167
You have to do what you have
to do to get it all to stop.

41:38.168 --> 41:40.339
- It's not easy for me.
- Because you're pissed off.

41:40.340 --> 41:43.708
But you know what, two
wrongs don't make right.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.781
I really hope Mark's frustration
doesn't affect his judgment

41:46.782 --> 41:49.114
when it comes to following my advice.

41:49.115 --> 41:52.300
I believe that if he follows
the steps I've given him...

41:52.301 --> 41:58.201
He'll not only be helping his
family but the dead here, too.

41:59.305 --> 42:05.471
