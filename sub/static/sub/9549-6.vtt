00:13.006 --> 00:15.816
I don't need any more towels.
I'm fine.

00:16.518 --> 00:18.683
I said i'm fine.

00:19.278 --> 00:21.275
What're you doing here?
You said 10:30.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.339
- I couldn't wait.
- Come in, come in.

00:25.842 --> 00:29.068
Oh, this room,
it's beautiful, isn't it?

00:29.193 --> 00:30.442
Yeah, it is.

00:30.567 --> 00:34.358
I'm gonna need ten more minutes.
I'm trying to look natural for you.

00:34.483 --> 00:36.775
It takes a lot of work
looking natural.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.976
You men never appreciate that.

00:39.101 --> 00:42.259
You were right about
the balcony, it's really fun.

00:42.384 --> 00:45.914
The last room i rented was some motel
room with a view of the parking lot.

00:46.039 --> 00:48.881
- Room service.
- I couldn't resist.

00:49.006 --> 00:52.709
They had your favorite.
Chocolate-covered strawberries.

00:52.834 --> 00:54.442
You've got to try one.

00:54.567 --> 00:56.467
They're sinful.

00:59.234 --> 01:00.876
Can i tell you the truth?

01:01.001 --> 01:02.531
I was beginning to think you were

01:02.656 --> 01:04.649
ashamed of being seen with me.

01:04.774 --> 01:07.730
Take off your coat
and stay a while. We've got all night.

01:07.855 --> 01:10.916
Callie, i want to ask you something.

01:11.041 --> 01:13.609
Really? My heart...

01:13.734 --> 01:15.515
my heart is beating like a rabbit's.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.155
I was hoping when you
asked me to meet you here...

01:18.280 --> 01:21.308
not here. On the balcony.
In the moonlight.

01:21.433 --> 01:24.103
I'm not sure there's much of a moon.

01:25.530 --> 01:28.675
I'm probably glowing
enough to make up for it.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.618
Oh, my god, i can't believe
this is happening.

01:43.064 --> 01:45.404
- Oh, my god.
- Do you like it?

01:45.529 --> 01:47.542
It's gorgeous. It's perfect.

01:47.667 --> 01:50.009
You won't regret this.
I promise.

01:50.134 --> 01:53.642
I'm sorry i've been calling you
so much lately, i just get so jealous.

01:53.767 --> 01:55.314
But that's over now.

01:55.439 --> 01:57.644
I am gonna make you so happy.

01:57.769 --> 01:58.942
I know you will.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.504
This is probably
the best night of my life.

02:01.629 --> 02:04.375
I could die right now,
i really could.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.209
Funny you should say that.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.377
What are you doing?

03:23.033 --> 03:25.342
Julie teeger is applying
to cal state berkeley

03:25.467 --> 03:27.509
where she is hoping
to major in theater arts.

03:27.634 --> 03:30.942
She thanks her mother natalie for
all the inspiration in the world.

03:31.067 --> 03:33.342
Oh, look, there's a little picture.

03:33.467 --> 03:35.851
Oh, god. I don't know why
i'm so nervous.

03:35.976 --> 03:39.398
I know she's gonna be great.
She's been performing her whole life.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.476
She used to do these little
skits in our living room,

03:41.601 --> 03:43.242
<i>and once she did the wizard of oz.</i>

03:43.367 --> 03:45.875
She did, like,
all the characters. Even the witch.

03:46.979 --> 03:50.076
I think this is my armrest,
and that one's yours.

03:50.201 --> 03:52.042
Mr. Monk, we're supposed to share.

03:52.167 --> 03:54.604
What are we, russia now?

03:54.934 --> 03:57.460
Okay, okay.
It's all yours.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.829
Oh, no.

04:00.954 --> 04:02.850
- It's john hannigan.
- Who?

04:03.971 --> 04:06.366
<i>The theater critic
from the san francisco dispatch.</i>

04:06.491 --> 04:08.116
What's he doing here?

04:08.241 --> 04:10.309
He doesn't normally
review community theater.

04:10.434 --> 04:12.864
Maybe he read julie's review
in the school paper. You think?

04:12.989 --> 04:14.299
- Maybe.
- Really?

04:15.097 --> 04:16.760
I hope he's in a good mood.

04:16.885 --> 04:19.676
He's normally so critical
about everything.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.992
Isn't that his job?
He's a critic.

04:33.910 --> 04:36.759
It's okay. Move down there.

04:47.033 --> 04:49.260
- Hello.
- Good evening.

04:49.385 --> 04:51.367
Is that your father?

04:52.313 --> 04:54.908
Would you two mind switching seats?

04:55.033 --> 04:56.309
Why?

04:56.434 --> 04:58.634
I just want to thank him
for his service.

05:11.013 --> 05:13.395
- Thank you for your service.
- No problem.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.542
Now all you need is a headless
man to sit in front of you.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.508
Or a dwarf.

05:23.541 --> 05:26.031
- What? What is it?
- We have to go home.

05:26.156 --> 05:27.299
Why?

05:28.590 --> 05:30.784
I have a situation.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.189
Nature.

05:33.339 --> 05:34.908
N-a...

05:35.033 --> 05:36.377
nature alert.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.309
Do you have to go to the bathroom?

05:38.434 --> 05:39.309
Hush.

05:39.434 --> 05:40.709
No, i'm not leaving.

05:40.834 --> 05:41.743
I've been waiting
all year to see this.

05:41.868 --> 05:43.642
We can be back in 20 minutes.

05:43.767 --> 05:44.776
Forget it.
Just forget it.

05:44.901 --> 05:46.142
She's only in two scenes.

05:46.267 --> 05:47.242
Why don't you just use

05:47.367 --> 05:49.667
the men's room like everybody else?

05:49.968 --> 05:51.609
I wish you could
hear yourself sometimes.

05:51.734 --> 05:53.442
The men's room is a public facility.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.075
I don't use public facilities.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.975
I'm sorry that you feel that way,

05:57.100 --> 05:59.567
because i'm not leaving.

06:19.334 --> 06:20.509
May i help you, sir?

06:20.634 --> 06:22.843
I'm sorry.
Just looking for the men's room.

06:22.968 --> 06:25.809
This is
the gentleman's restroom, sir.

06:25.934 --> 06:28.667
This is the men's room?

06:29.968 --> 06:31.676
How long has this been going on?

06:31.801 --> 06:33.609
Oh, since the theater
was built, sir.

06:33.734 --> 06:35.476
That would be 1910.

06:35.601 --> 06:37.242
That's fantastic.

06:37.367 --> 06:38.743
Oh, thank you, sir.

06:38.868 --> 06:40.908
I like to think of it
as someplace special.

06:41.033 --> 06:44.008
A sort of sanctuary, as it were.

06:44.133 --> 06:46.309
Uh, an oasis in the desert.

06:46.434 --> 06:47.576
Yeah.

06:47.701 --> 06:48.908
You...

06:49.033 --> 06:51.075
you must have
ten different soaps here.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.975
Exactly ten, sir.

06:53.100 --> 06:53.975
Yes, sir.

06:54.100 --> 06:56.000
Oh, my.

06:58.067 --> 06:59.776
Ah, that's from china, sir.

06:59.901 --> 07:01.275
The gansu province.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.409
Very nice.

07:03.534 --> 07:04.734
Oh, may i?

07:06.701 --> 07:10.705
It's peruvian cotton, sir.
They're hand-woven.

07:11.701 --> 07:13.843
I didn't think people like you...

07:13.968 --> 07:17.042
attendants, still existed.

07:17.167 --> 07:19.442
Eh, we're a dying breed, sir.

07:19.567 --> 07:22.442
Some people would consider
this work beneath them,

07:22.567 --> 07:23.609
but, um, i enjoy it.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.609
My father used to say,

07:25.734 --> 07:28.242
"gilson, there are no small jobs,

07:28.367 --> 07:30.501
there are only small people."
[laughs]

07:34.067 --> 07:35.942
thanks, buddy.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.467
Here you go.

07:42.968 --> 07:45.242
I believe that's mine, sir.

07:45.367 --> 07:47.309
Oh, yes, i'm sorry.

07:47.434 --> 07:51.334
That would make more sense.

07:57.734 --> 07:59.875
That was fast.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.042
I went to the men's room.

08:01.167 --> 08:02.442
Here?

08:02.567 --> 08:04.642
Mr. Monk, congratulations.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.409
I'm proud of you.

08:06.534 --> 08:07.743
How was it?

08:07.868 --> 08:09.209
It was magical.
It was spotless.

08:09.334 --> 08:10.975
I might become
a patron of this theater

08:11.100 --> 08:12.142
just so i can use it.

08:12.267 --> 08:16.042
Two armrests, a clean bathroom...

08:16.167 --> 08:19.133
this is a perfect night
at the theater.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.008
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

08:23.133 --> 08:24.476
I bid you welcome

08:24.601 --> 08:28.605
to the magical boulevard
of dreams known as broadway.

08:30.234 --> 08:32.801
Maybe i spoke too soon.

08:44.601 --> 08:45.476
He's bored.

08:45.601 --> 08:48.875
He's checking his watch.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.209
He won't be bored for long.

08:50.334 --> 08:51.834
Julie's next.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.342
Wasn't she great?
Wasn't she wonderful?

09:43.467 --> 09:45.376
She was so poised.
Wasn't she poised?

09:45.501 --> 09:47.642
She was very poised.
She was very poised.

09:47.767 --> 09:49.409
There he is.

09:49.534 --> 09:51.209
He looks happy.

09:51.334 --> 09:55.209
If you saw that bathroom
you'd understand why.

09:55.334 --> 09:59.042
<i>You know who i loved
was the girl that sang away.</i>

09:59.167 --> 10:01.175
What was her name?
Julie something?

10:01.300 --> 10:02.642
Oh, yeah.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.075
Oh, yeah. Julie teeger.
She was the best.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.734
Yeah, i thought so too.

10:08.033 --> 10:09.275
And who would've thought

10:09.400 --> 10:11.309
she has the same last name as you.

10:11.434 --> 10:13.843
That's unbelievable.

10:13.968 --> 10:16.467
I think he bought it.

10:19.300 --> 10:20.709
That's odd.

10:20.834 --> 10:21.875
What?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.409
He just threw away

10:23.534 --> 10:24.743
an unopened pack
of cigarettes and a lighter.

10:24.868 --> 10:26.743
Maybe he's trying to quit.

10:26.868 --> 10:28.743
Excuse me.

10:28.868 --> 10:30.476
Are you looking
for miss julie teeger?

10:30.601 --> 10:32.476
Yes, ma'am.
Have you seen her?

10:32.601 --> 10:35.908
We wanted to tell her how
beautiful and talented she was!

10:36.033 --> 10:38.309
Okay, so how was it?

10:38.434 --> 10:39.309
Oh, you were great.

10:39.434 --> 10:41.075
You were so...

10:41.200 --> 10:42.075
poised.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.342
Oh, honey, it was so wonderful.

10:43.467 --> 10:44.576
And the song was...
i cried.

10:44.701 --> 10:45.576
We both cried.

10:45.701 --> 10:46.875
Oh, really?

10:47.000 --> 10:47.942
Yeah, and that last scene
in the retirement home

10:48.067 --> 10:49.409
was so beautiful.

10:49.534 --> 10:51.042
I just... i can't believe
it's only for one night.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.175
Why are you still in the makeup?

10:53.300 --> 10:54.743
Everyone's in makeup.

10:54.868 --> 10:57.875
We thought it would be fun to go
to the cast party this way.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.942
Hey, julie! Come on!
The party's starting!

11:00.067 --> 11:02.342
Oh, good.
Okay, i've got to go.

11:02.467 --> 11:04.275
Is it okay if i stay
until the reviews come out?

11:04.400 --> 11:05.542
Everyone's staying.
Please say yes.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.075
I don't know, i don't know. Okay.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.067
That's a yes. I love you.
Bye, mom. Bye, mr. Monk.

11:15.734 --> 11:16.743
What're you doing here?

11:16.868 --> 11:17.809
Julie's musical.

11:17.934 --> 11:19.075
The theater is
right down the street.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.609
Oh, yeah, was that tonight?
How did it go?

11:21.734 --> 11:22.676
She was great.

11:22.801 --> 11:24.409
Everybody thought so, not just me.

11:24.534 --> 11:26.942
Yeah, she was very poised.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.142
I'm sure she was.
Congratulations.

11:29.267 --> 11:32.409
So what's going on here?

11:32.534 --> 11:34.942
Jumper.
She was staying at the hotel.

11:35.067 --> 11:37.109
Looks like she checked out early.

11:37.234 --> 11:38.843
May i take a look?

11:38.968 --> 11:41.934
I thought you'd never ask.

11:49.134 --> 11:50.676
Who was she?

11:50.801 --> 11:52.043
Callie esterhaus.

11:52.168 --> 11:53.942
She's a waitress at winberries.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.342
She's local.
Very local.

11:55.467 --> 11:56.942
She lives
about ten blocks from here.

11:57.067 --> 11:58.575
She checked in about 6:00.

11:58.700 --> 11:59.809
Was she alone?

11:59.934 --> 12:02.175
She checked in alone.
That's all we know.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.575
Two champagne glasses.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.442
She was expecting someone.

12:05.567 --> 12:09.001
Yes, sir. She ordered
room service about 8:15.

12:12.201 --> 12:13.076
May we help you?

12:13.201 --> 12:14.242
Are you wearing cologne?

12:14.367 --> 12:16.043
No, thank you for asking.

12:16.168 --> 12:17.742
Do you smell that?

12:17.867 --> 12:18.876
Probably her perfume.

12:19.001 --> 12:20.542
No, that's men's cologne.

12:20.667 --> 12:21.709
My grandfather used to wear that.

12:21.834 --> 12:24.600
It smells nice.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.143
It's not me.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.742
Don't look at me.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.767
Yeah...

12:31.534 --> 12:33.242
i think her date showed up.

12:33.367 --> 12:36.442
He showed up early, unexpectedly.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.342
And he killed her.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.342
How do you figure?

12:40.467 --> 12:42.400
Her hair was wet...
yeah.

12:44.001 --> 12:45.175
Right?
Right.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.109
Her new dress laid out on the bed,

12:47.234 --> 12:48.667
her makeup kit still open.

12:49.901 --> 12:50.909
Plus...

12:51.034 --> 12:54.767
only one false eyelash.

12:58.234 --> 13:00.208
Hey, officer,

13:00.333 --> 13:02.776
call dr. D. have him check
the body for a false eyelash.

13:02.901 --> 13:04.409
Yes, sir.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.609
What do we do with this?

13:05.734 --> 13:08.208
Chocolate strawberry.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.809
The bite mark. We're assuming
it was the jumper's.

13:10.934 --> 13:12.976
Don't assume anything.
Bag it.

13:13.101 --> 13:15.375
Where the hell's randy?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.143
I sent him out to get a newspaper.

13:17.268 --> 13:18.568
You?

13:18.834 --> 13:21.009
You're...
you sent randy out.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.609
Who are you,
the new police commissioner?

13:22.734 --> 13:24.208
The morning edition
comes out at midnight.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.542
They're gonna review julie's play.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.609
For the love of god,
he's a police lieutenant,

13:27.734 --> 13:29.308
not a bellhop.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.308
Maybe he is.

13:30.433 --> 13:33.976
Hey, monk, come here.

13:34.101 --> 13:35.442
Come on.

13:35.567 --> 13:37.942
Yeah, i don't think so.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.342
Monk, if she was pushed...

13:39.467 --> 13:40.909
and it's looking
like she was pushed...

13:41.034 --> 13:42.076
it happened out here.

13:42.201 --> 13:43.076
This is the crime scene.

13:43.201 --> 13:44.308
I'm good.

13:44.433 --> 13:45.676
For the love of god, monk,
it's a balcony.

13:45.801 --> 13:46.842
It's perfectly safe.

13:46.967 --> 13:49.842
It wasn't perfectly safe for her.

13:49.967 --> 13:52.009
She landed

13:52.134 --> 13:54.109
by the awning, so we figure

13:54.234 --> 13:55.676
she went over someplace about here.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.076
I think she was over there.

13:57.201 --> 14:00.175
By that plant.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.976
Three or four leaves missing.

14:02.101 --> 14:04.967
I think she grabbed at the plant
as she went over.

14:07.734 --> 14:08.967
You're right.

14:13.934 --> 14:15.043
What do you got?

14:15.168 --> 14:16.609
It's a ribbon.

14:16.734 --> 14:18.834
"Lasky."

14:19.467 --> 14:20.475
Lasky jewelers.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.609
It's probably from a jewelry box.

14:22.734 --> 14:26.076
It's small.
Might have been a ring.

14:26.201 --> 14:28.676
Officer, could you
hang onto that for me, please?

14:28.801 --> 14:30.442
Look at this footprint.

14:30.567 --> 14:32.542
He was on his toes.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.375
Yeah, i see it.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.676
He was squatting.

14:37.801 --> 14:39.709
Or kneeling.

14:39.834 --> 14:43.809
He was proposing to her.

14:43.934 --> 14:45.876
You know, that fits.

14:46.001 --> 14:49.442
The hotel suite,
the champagne, the ring box.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.809
He comes here to propose to her,
he pops the question,

14:51.934 --> 14:54.076
she turns him down,
he snaps and kills her.

14:54.201 --> 14:55.409
So we're looking for a boyfriend.

14:55.534 --> 14:57.208
Boyfriend. Good.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.231
Boyfriends are good.
They're easy to find.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.876
Did you get it?

15:03.001 --> 15:04.342
Yeah, it's...
it's not in here, though.

15:04.467 --> 15:06.909
Maybe...
maybe tomorrow's.

15:07.034 --> 15:08.143
Can i see it?

15:08.268 --> 15:09.909
No.
Why?

15:10.034 --> 15:12.308
Because he's a critic, natalie.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.375
Who cares what he thinks?

15:14.500 --> 15:17.242
He's probably
just a frustrated actor, anyway.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.308
I'm too nervous.
You read it.

15:19.433 --> 15:21.676
Look, this is just
one man's opinion, just...

15:21.801 --> 15:23.067
read it.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.409
"Last night's premiere...
first-rate material...

15:27.534 --> 15:29.609
"second-rate arrangements,"
blah, blah, blah...

15:29.734 --> 15:31.776
no "blah, blah, blahs."

15:31.901 --> 15:35.905
Let me see that.
Give it.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.542
<i>"Julie teeger's rendition of away,</i>

15:42.667 --> 15:45.609
"the classic ballad,
was completely...

15:45.734 --> 15:48.834
"forgettable.

15:51.934 --> 15:53.909
"A corny, cliche-filled performance

15:54.034 --> 15:56.208
"that had me begging for less.

15:56.333 --> 16:00.337
Ms. Teeger owes me
four minutes of my life back."

16:03.001 --> 16:06.067
That could mean anything.

16:10.901 --> 16:12.734
You okay?

16:17.567 --> 16:20.442
He's just a jerk.
It doesn't matter.

16:20.567 --> 16:23.467
I guess not.

16:30.467 --> 16:31.867
You were friends with callie?

16:33.801 --> 16:35.676
I knew her, but i didn't
really know her,

16:35.801 --> 16:37.175
if you get what i mean.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.609
She only worked here
a couple of weeks.

16:38.734 --> 16:40.342
Was she dating anyone?

16:40.467 --> 16:41.676
I think so.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.575
She was kind of private
about that stuff.

16:43.700 --> 16:44.842
I think he might've been married.

16:44.967 --> 16:47.409
It was just a feeling i got.

16:47.534 --> 16:49.076
Did she ever mention any names?

16:49.201 --> 16:50.409
We, found a date book
in her apartment.

16:50.534 --> 16:52.600
She referred to a man by initial...

16:53.801 --> 16:55.342
j.
Does that mean anything?

16:55.467 --> 16:59.471
Maybe his name began with a j?

16:59.801 --> 17:02.208
Did you just write that down?

17:02.333 --> 17:03.709
I put a question mark after it.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.143
"Corny, cliche-filled performance?"

17:05.268 --> 17:07.143
How can they say that?
It's just not true!

17:07.268 --> 17:08.375
I thought you threw that out.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.709
I bought another one.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.809
Natalie, you're torturing yourself.

17:11.934 --> 17:13.042
You've become obsessed
with this review.

17:13.167 --> 17:15.776
Look who's talking.
That's true.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.942
Okay, i get obsessed too,
but i can handle it.

17:18.067 --> 17:19.108
I've had years of experience.

17:19.233 --> 17:20.442
How could he call her forgettable?

17:20.567 --> 17:22.165
My daughter is anything but!

17:22.767 --> 17:24.108
Excuse me.

17:24.233 --> 17:25.509
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but what...

17:25.634 --> 17:27.409
what homicide case
are you guys working on?

17:27.534 --> 17:29.442
Because we're working
on the callie esterhaus case.

17:29.567 --> 17:31.143
Maybe you remember it.

17:31.268 --> 17:33.076
Natalie, forget about that review.

17:33.201 --> 17:34.275
He broke my little girl's heart.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.542
Julie's a tough kid.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.109
She'll...
he called her forgettable!

17:37.234 --> 17:38.976
Don't just stand here
whining about it.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.676
Why don't you go
yell at what's-his-face?

17:40.801 --> 17:42.742
The... the... the critic.

17:42.867 --> 17:44.409
His office is five blocks
down the street.

17:44.534 --> 17:46.234
Go on.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.742
Sorry about that.
She's had a tough day.

17:49.867 --> 17:51.308
Did she know callie too?

17:51.433 --> 17:52.575
Yeah, she did.

17:52.700 --> 17:56.308
Natalie, for god...

17:56.433 --> 17:57.901
where'd she go?

18:00.467 --> 18:04.308
It's the biggest engagement
picture the paper's ever run.

18:04.433 --> 18:07.642
I'm surprised your father
didn't put it on the front page.

18:07.767 --> 18:09.609
He wanted to.

18:09.734 --> 18:11.208
I think daddy's more excited
about this wedding than you are.

18:11.333 --> 18:13.143
That's not possible.

18:13.268 --> 18:15.442
Excuse me.
John hannigan.

18:15.567 --> 18:16.776
That all depends.

18:16.901 --> 18:17.976
My name is natalie teeger.

18:18.101 --> 18:19.542
My daughter julie teeger was in

18:19.667 --> 18:21.009
the play that you reviewed
last night.

18:21.134 --> 18:24.208
If you'll excuse me,
i'm kissing my luscious fiancee.

18:24.333 --> 18:27.409
<i>Yeah, sorry, she sang away.
The ballad, remember?</i>

18:27.534 --> 18:30.275
You called her
"completely forgettable."

18:30.400 --> 18:32.109
Your daughter is not forgettable.

18:32.234 --> 18:35.776
No, what i meant to say
was i wish i could forget her,

18:35.901 --> 18:39.905
but alas, the banality
of that tune she tried to sing

18:41.101 --> 18:43.208
is seared indelibly in my brain.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.776
Is that better?

18:44.901 --> 18:47.076
You know what you are,
mr. Hannigan, you're a bully.

18:47.201 --> 18:49.308
For your information, julie got
the most applause of anyone.

18:49.433 --> 18:52.175
People loved her.
They were crying.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.976
Oh, i'm sure they were.

18:54.101 --> 18:55.409
Ah, lunch.

18:55.534 --> 18:56.409
Thank you, kevin.

18:56.534 --> 18:58.475
Winberries again?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.009
I'm a creature of habit, darling.

19:00.134 --> 19:02.976
Get used to it.

19:03.101 --> 19:05.676
Your complaint
has been noted, miss teeger.

19:05.801 --> 19:06.967
Is there anything else?

19:09.367 --> 19:11.367
Is there something wrong?

19:19.101 --> 19:21.375
What about the people
in the next room?

19:21.500 --> 19:23.208
Maybe they heard something.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.976
I already talked to them.
They were out all night.

19:25.101 --> 19:27.609
Fingerprints on the railing?

19:27.734 --> 19:30.242
Yeah, there were fingerprints.
They belong to the maid.

19:30.367 --> 19:33.375
He must've worn gloves.
This guy knew what he was doing.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.308
There you are.
Where have you been?

19:35.433 --> 19:37.409
I've been thinking.
I solved the case.

19:37.534 --> 19:38.809
What case?

19:38.934 --> 19:41.809
I know who killed callie esterhaus.

19:41.934 --> 19:43.834
It was john hannigan the critic.

19:45.801 --> 19:48.842
Look, natalie, we know you're
upset about that review,

19:48.967 --> 19:50.575
but you can't go around
accusing the man of murder.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.009
No, he did it.
I know that he did it.

19:52.134 --> 19:54.776
I went to his office.
He's wearing the same cologne.

19:54.901 --> 19:56.642
The cologne that we smelled
in that hotel room.

19:56.767 --> 19:58.109
The cologne you smelled.

19:58.234 --> 19:59.342
Plus he's a "j." "J" for john.

19:59.467 --> 20:01.009
Plus they probably knew each other.

20:01.134 --> 20:04.509
She worked at winberries.
That's his favorite restaurant.

20:04.634 --> 20:05.509
He eats there every day.

20:05.634 --> 20:07.076
Okay, okay, first of all,

20:07.201 --> 20:11.205
callie esterhaus died at 8:35,
which was during julie's show.

20:11.634 --> 20:14.242
Hannigan was in his seat
all night. We saw him.

20:14.367 --> 20:15.609
No, he snuck out during the show.

20:15.734 --> 20:17.109
The hotel is right down the street.

20:17.234 --> 20:18.809
He killed her
and then snuck back in.

20:18.934 --> 20:20.842
Natalie, we were there.

20:20.967 --> 20:22.242
You kept looking up at him.

20:22.367 --> 20:24.475
He never left his seat.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.275
You've got to admit,
it's a pretty good alibi.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.009
Sold-out theater,
including adrian monk.

20:28.134 --> 20:29.542
He did it.

20:29.667 --> 20:31.208
I don't know how he did it,
but he did it.

20:31.333 --> 20:32.542
That's what he always says.

20:32.667 --> 20:35.475
Okay, what about motive?
Okay?

20:35.600 --> 20:37.876
Motive, you know, that's the reason.

20:38.001 --> 20:39.609
Yeah, i know
what a motive is, mr. Monk.

20:39.734 --> 20:41.976
Hannigan is planning
to marry diana phelps,

20:42.101 --> 20:43.542
the boss's daughter.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.542
If she knew about callie,
she would've left him

20:45.667 --> 20:47.475
and his career would've been over.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.442
Okay, so you want us
to go arrest the guy

20:49.567 --> 20:51.308
because his name begins with "j,"

20:51.433 --> 20:52.509
and he might have met her.

20:52.634 --> 20:53.776
I have proof.

20:53.901 --> 20:55.809
You have proof?

20:55.934 --> 20:57.009
Proof.

20:57.134 --> 20:58.242
Proof positive.
Ironclad.

20:58.367 --> 21:01.433
If anybody sees it,
they'll know he did it.

21:04.834 --> 21:05.809
Do i have to do this?

21:05.934 --> 21:07.208
Oh, no.
Sweetie, we talked about this.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.909
This is a murder investigation.
It's very important.

21:09.034 --> 21:10.542
Okay, cell phones off.

21:10.667 --> 21:11.876
What?

21:12.001 --> 21:12.909
Cell phones off.

21:13.034 --> 21:14.409
And if anybody has any hard candy,

21:14.534 --> 21:16.342
please unwrap it now.

21:16.467 --> 21:18.700
Ready?
Yes.

21:49.333 --> 21:52.109
So let's go pick him up.

21:52.234 --> 21:54.542
What am i missing here?

21:54.667 --> 21:55.542
That's your proof?

21:55.667 --> 21:58.542
This is the proof.

21:58.667 --> 22:01.742
Nobody who was in that theater
who heard that voice

22:01.867 --> 22:02.776
could've written this review.

22:02.901 --> 22:04.409
He wasn't there.

22:04.534 --> 22:06.109
He couldn't have been there.

22:06.234 --> 22:10.238
My daughter is not forgettable.

22:14.067 --> 22:15.475
I think julie is wonderful,

22:15.600 --> 22:17.109
and she was wonderful last night.

22:17.234 --> 22:18.776
Very poised.

22:18.901 --> 22:20.375
But that doesn't necessarily mean...

22:20.500 --> 22:22.976
you don't believe me either?

22:23.101 --> 22:24.700
Julie, sing it again.

22:25.934 --> 22:27.475
No, no, no, that's okay.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.009
That's okay, sweetie,
we got the point.

22:29.134 --> 22:30.242
You made your point.

22:30.367 --> 22:31.809
Natalie, listen.

22:31.934 --> 22:35.043
You've certainly given us
a lot to think about.

22:35.168 --> 22:36.109
Yeah.

22:36.234 --> 22:38.676
Forget about it.

22:38.801 --> 22:42.175
Sorry to have wasted
your time, detectives.

22:42.300 --> 22:43.809
Honey, let's go.

22:43.934 --> 22:45.542
I'm... i'm sorry.

22:45.667 --> 22:48.876
It... it wasn't my idea.
I'm sorry.

22:49.001 --> 22:52.634
It was very nice.

23:06.934 --> 23:08.109
Hello?

23:08.234 --> 23:10.742
Mr. Monk?
I'm sorry to bother you.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.876
Natalie, are you okay?
Where are you?

23:13.001 --> 23:15.575
I'm downtown.
I'm at the police station.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.809
What are you doing here?

23:18.934 --> 23:20.034
I've been arrested.

23:25.634 --> 23:26.809
I don't understand.
Wait a sec.

23:26.934 --> 23:27.843
You were in the man's backyard?

23:27.968 --> 23:30.175
That's right.

23:30.300 --> 23:31.975
Looking through his garbage.
What... what were you doing?

23:32.100 --> 23:33.609
I was doing your job.

23:33.734 --> 23:37.442
Natalie, just a review.
It's just one review.

23:37.567 --> 23:38.442
Yeah, and julie seems fine with it.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.008
It wasn't a review.

23:40.133 --> 23:43.376
It wasn't a real review
because he wasn't there.

23:43.501 --> 23:44.776
Mr. Monk, he did it.

23:44.901 --> 23:46.042
I know that he did it.

23:46.167 --> 23:47.075
Because he criticized her?

23:47.200 --> 23:48.801
Because she sings like an angel.

23:50.734 --> 23:51.875
This is adrian monk.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.442
He consults with us upon occasion.

23:53.567 --> 23:55.809
Yes, hello.
I'm a big fan.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.209
This is lieutenant disher,

23:57.334 --> 23:59.008
and, i believe

23:59.133 --> 24:00.342
you know natalie teeger.

24:00.467 --> 24:01.843
Unfortunately, yes.

24:01.968 --> 24:03.609
Good news.

24:03.734 --> 24:06.908
Mr. Hannigan has graciously
agreed to drop all charges.

24:07.033 --> 24:09.109
So we're letting you off
with a warning, miss teeger.

24:09.234 --> 24:12.534
Oh, thank god.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.242
I have an announcement too.

24:16.367 --> 24:19.209
I'm not giving up.
I am never giving up.

24:19.334 --> 24:20.809
Because you broke
my daughter's heart,

24:20.934 --> 24:22.008
and you killed that poor
waitress down the street.

24:22.133 --> 24:23.609
Now i've killed a waitress.

24:23.734 --> 24:25.476
This is getting
more pathetic by the minute.

24:25.601 --> 24:28.442
Which explains
what you were doing there.

24:28.567 --> 24:29.609
You never review community theater.

24:29.734 --> 24:31.843
And what about...

24:31.968 --> 24:33.468
this?

24:33.601 --> 24:35.109
Oh, god.

24:35.234 --> 24:36.908
It's...
what is that?

24:37.033 --> 24:39.008
It's a chinese dumpling.

24:39.133 --> 24:40.142
I found it in your trash can.

24:40.267 --> 24:43.042
These are your bite marks.

24:43.167 --> 24:46.609
Look. The strawberry
from the crime scene.

24:46.734 --> 24:47.975
It's a perfect match.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.709
Actually, we can't match it.

24:49.834 --> 24:51.743
The strawberry was too soft.
We couldn't get a cast.

24:51.868 --> 24:55.734
It looks the same to me.

25:00.534 --> 25:02.743
I don't...

25:02.868 --> 25:04.075
it's quite all right, gentlemen.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.409
I've dealt
with stage mothers before.

25:05.534 --> 25:07.275
They're almost all delusional

25:07.400 --> 25:09.209
and, to some extent, unstable.

25:09.334 --> 25:10.942
It's sad, really.

25:11.067 --> 25:13.809
Miss teeger, my advice to you

25:13.934 --> 25:15.875
is to worry about your own problems

25:16.000 --> 25:19.242
and not try to live vicariously
through your daughter.

25:19.367 --> 25:22.175
I wish i could stay,
but i have a column to finish.

25:22.300 --> 25:24.175
<i>Au revoir, gentlemen.</i>

25:24.300 --> 25:26.942
Miss teeger,
you can keep the dumpling.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.109
You monster!

25:28.234 --> 25:29.242
Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa...

25:29.367 --> 25:31.309
she's not with us, not officially.

25:31.434 --> 25:34.309
You're gonna rot in hell!

25:34.434 --> 25:37.334
Not with us.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.509
What's this?

25:46.634 --> 25:48.309
A check for $300.

25:48.434 --> 25:49.743
I'm hiring you, mr. Monk.

25:49.868 --> 25:51.743
I need your help.
I can't do it myself.

25:51.868 --> 25:53.609
Oh, this check's no good.

25:53.734 --> 25:55.875
That's sweet of you to say, but...

25:56.000 --> 25:57.542
no, it's literally no good.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.175
You can't cover this.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.175
Sure i can. I just deposited
my paycheck on wednesday.

26:01.300 --> 26:02.743
Right,

26:02.868 --> 26:06.442
but i happen to know that
that check is going to bounce.

26:06.567 --> 26:10.175
So this check
is pretty much worthless.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.209
You wrote me a bad check?

26:12.334 --> 26:13.509
How could you do that?

26:13.634 --> 26:15.409
I might ask you the same question.

26:15.534 --> 26:17.843
No, no, no...

26:17.968 --> 26:19.342
your check was bad first.

26:19.467 --> 26:20.442
Natalie, there's
no right and wrong here.

26:20.567 --> 26:21.743
It's all tangled up.

26:21.868 --> 26:23.008
One check, another check.

26:23.133 --> 26:24.109
It's like the chicken and the egg.

26:24.234 --> 26:25.376
No, it's not.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.142
There... there's no egg here.
There's no egg.

26:27.267 --> 26:28.975
This is all chicken.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.934
Look, you're taking my check
and you're working for me.

26:40.701 --> 26:43.868
Julie said the review doesn't
matter, but i know that it does.

26:45.334 --> 26:48.908
Julie's a kid.
She'll bounce back.

26:49.033 --> 26:50.809
How can you say that?

26:50.934 --> 26:52.576
When have you
bounced back from anything?

26:52.701 --> 26:53.809
You're still dealing with stuff

26:53.934 --> 26:56.576
your father said to you
when you were three.

26:56.701 --> 26:59.509
People don't forget.
People don't always bounce back.

26:59.634 --> 27:01.376
This could ruin everything for her.

27:01.501 --> 27:03.342
He wasn't there.

27:03.467 --> 27:06.509
I just have to prove it,
but i can't do it myself.

27:06.634 --> 27:10.409
All right. All right.
I'll take a look.

27:10.534 --> 27:13.175
You can just owe me the money.

27:13.300 --> 27:14.342
You owe me the money.

27:14.467 --> 27:15.609
Why don't we just call it even?

27:15.734 --> 27:16.968
How is that even?

27:17.968 --> 27:18.942
If i have to explain that to you,

27:19.067 --> 27:21.567
i'm probably paying you too much.

27:28.067 --> 27:29.676
You're doing great.

27:29.801 --> 27:33.805
Does mr. Hannigan
always sit up here?

27:34.200 --> 27:35.075
As a matter of fact, no.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.075
That was his first time.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.309
Normally he's down here.
Fifth row, center.

27:39.434 --> 27:42.609
Yeah, why did he move?

27:42.734 --> 27:43.676
I didn't question it.

27:43.801 --> 27:45.175
I figured he wanted his privacy.

27:45.300 --> 27:49.304
That... that's important, right?
That sounds important.

27:49.434 --> 27:50.709
Why was he sitting up here?

27:50.834 --> 27:53.184
What's so important about this seat?

28:11.567 --> 28:13.342
This light's out.

28:13.467 --> 28:14.642
I didn't notice it.

28:14.767 --> 28:17.217
I'll get the maintenance
guys on that.

28:21.501 --> 28:23.400
Hold that.

28:28.234 --> 28:32.238
It's not burnt out.
Someone unscrewed it.

28:32.801 --> 28:34.242
That's something.
That's something, right?

28:34.367 --> 28:35.843
He... he... he wanted
to make it darker,

28:35.968 --> 28:37.908
so when no one was looking,

28:38.033 --> 28:40.109
he replaced himself
with an inflatable dummy.

28:40.234 --> 28:42.209
Yeah, i don't think so.

28:42.334 --> 28:44.142
He was moving.
I saw him clapping.

28:44.267 --> 28:48.271
How about
a mechanical man, like a robot?

28:48.534 --> 28:52.538
Yeah, maybe.
I've got to wash up.

28:57.334 --> 28:59.609
Mr. Monk, welcome back, sir.

28:59.734 --> 29:01.576
Hello, gilson.
I wonder if i could wash up.

29:01.701 --> 29:02.908
Of course.

29:03.033 --> 29:04.975
Mrs. Coruthers said
you might be coming by.

29:05.100 --> 29:08.242
Said it was part of a...
a big, uh, investigation.

29:08.367 --> 29:09.801
That's right.
That's right.

29:10.801 --> 29:12.142
This... this is different.

29:12.267 --> 29:16.175
Oh, yes, i've separated
the antibacterial soap, sir.

29:16.300 --> 29:18.008
I see that.
I see that.

29:18.133 --> 29:20.075
That's exactly
how i have it at home.

29:20.200 --> 29:24.204
High praise, indeed, sir.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.067
Thank you.

29:30.300 --> 29:31.609
Let me ask you something.

29:31.734 --> 29:35.738
You know the box seat up there
in the mezzanine, section b?

29:35.968 --> 29:37.875
Yes, sir.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.743
Do you think someone could

29:39.868 --> 29:42.809
sneak out of there
during a performance?

29:42.934 --> 29:44.776
I wouldn't know, sir.

29:44.901 --> 29:46.609
There's an exit door up there.

29:46.734 --> 29:47.809
Where does it lead?

29:47.934 --> 29:49.776
To a fire escape.

29:49.901 --> 29:52.075
It leads out back,
behind the theater.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.542
Behind the theater.

29:55.667 --> 29:57.676
Behind the...
look at these towels.

29:57.801 --> 30:00.509
Look at these towels.

30:00.634 --> 30:02.908
You are an artist, gilson.

30:03.033 --> 30:04.875
No, you are...

30:05.000 --> 30:06.676
you are the michelangelo
of lavatories.

30:06.801 --> 30:08.342
Oh, thank you, sir.

30:08.467 --> 30:09.875
You've got me curious.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.908
Just what is the nature of the...

30:12.033 --> 30:13.743
of the case you're involved in?

30:13.868 --> 30:15.109
I'm here with my assistant,

30:15.234 --> 30:16.509
and she thinks that someone

30:16.634 --> 30:19.709
snuck out during the play
on saturday night,

30:19.834 --> 30:21.843
killed a woman up the street,
and then snuck back in.

30:21.968 --> 30:23.676
Killed a woman?

30:23.801 --> 30:25.875
His girlfriend.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.467
And what do you think, sir?

30:29.634 --> 30:32.576
I thought it was crazy at first,

30:32.701 --> 30:35.476
but now i'm beginning to think

30:35.601 --> 30:39.300
she's on to something.

30:49.067 --> 30:51.109
Did you see anything...

30:51.234 --> 30:52.275
that night, the night we met?

30:52.400 --> 30:55.075
No, sir, not that i can recall,

30:55.200 --> 30:57.042
but i'm not the person to ask.

30:57.167 --> 30:59.376
I don't have the best
view of the house.

30:59.501 --> 31:01.409
Of course,
if you think of anything...

31:01.534 --> 31:04.042
anything unusual, here's my card.

31:04.167 --> 31:05.042
Give me a call.

31:05.167 --> 31:06.209
Yes, sir.

31:06.334 --> 31:07.542
Good-bye again, sir.

31:07.667 --> 31:11.671
It's always a pleasure, sir.

31:11.901 --> 31:13.667
Michelangelo.

31:25.167 --> 31:27.743
Mr. Hannigan.

31:27.868 --> 31:29.768
Gilson.

31:30.300 --> 31:31.800
What?

31:33.067 --> 31:34.175
What are you doing here?

31:34.300 --> 31:36.175
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.

31:36.300 --> 31:37.776
I... oh, this is for you.

31:37.901 --> 31:40.042
A small gift.
I thought it might help.

31:40.167 --> 31:41.709
There's a performance tonight.

31:41.834 --> 31:43.908
You took a night off
to bring me this?

31:44.033 --> 31:45.743
Actually, i wanted to talk to you

31:45.868 --> 31:48.875
about saturday night.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.467
A policeman came to see me.
A man named monk.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.975
A woman was murdered
near the theater.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.908
Really?

31:58.033 --> 32:00.275
Saturday night, about 8:30.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.900
Are you...

32:03.667 --> 32:05.042
involved in something, sir?

32:05.167 --> 32:06.476
I just don't want any trouble.

32:06.601 --> 32:09.634
It's just a coincidence, gilson.

32:10.868 --> 32:12.843
You worry too much.

32:12.968 --> 32:15.242
Hey, as long as you're here,

32:15.367 --> 32:18.542
would you help me carry some boxes?

32:18.667 --> 32:20.743
I'm supposed to bring them inside.

32:20.868 --> 32:24.367
Yes, sir, i'd be happy to.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.442
How bad is it?

32:41.567 --> 32:43.409
Oh, it's bad.
Blunt force trauma.

32:43.534 --> 32:45.909
He was hit from behind.
Metal bat, maybe a crowbar.

32:46.034 --> 32:47.575
Oh, no.

32:47.700 --> 32:48.742
Construction crew found him

32:48.867 --> 32:50.009
on the bayshore freeway
under an off-ramp.

32:50.134 --> 32:52.043
Can... can we talk to him?

32:52.168 --> 32:55.475
Maybe not for a while.
He's in a coma.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.976
How do you know this guy?

32:57.101 --> 33:00.375
He's... he's my
men's room attendant.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.000
Okay.

33:03.467 --> 33:05.475
It was john hannigan.
He did it.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.842
Oh, here we go.

33:07.967 --> 33:09.109
No, it can't be a coincidence.
He worked at the theater.

33:09.234 --> 33:10.942
Teeger, give it a rest.

33:11.067 --> 33:13.809
Are you gonna blame every crime
in california on this guy?

33:13.934 --> 33:15.909
What is this?

33:16.034 --> 33:17.676
Stuff in his jacket.

33:17.801 --> 33:19.275
Nicotine gum?

33:19.400 --> 33:20.742
Yeah, we already checked.
He never smoked.

33:20.867 --> 33:22.642
It's probably a gift
for someone else.

33:22.767 --> 33:24.667
Wait...

33:25.067 --> 33:26.967
wait...

33:33.268 --> 33:34.509
don't hug me.

33:34.634 --> 33:36.043
You're gonna want to hug me,
but don't hug me.

33:36.168 --> 33:37.468
Why?

33:37.634 --> 33:39.375
You were right about hannigan.
He's the guy.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.009
I knew it!
I knew it! I knew it!

33:42.134 --> 33:44.542
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, mr. Monk!

33:44.667 --> 33:46.342
The... the man we saw that night,

33:46.467 --> 33:48.375
the man in the box seats,

33:48.500 --> 33:51.542
had a wristwatch, remember?

33:51.667 --> 33:53.375
We saw him checking it.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.942
John hannigan doesn't
wear a wristwatch.

33:56.067 --> 33:58.842
I wish i could stay,
but i have a column to finish.

33:58.967 --> 34:01.676
The man we saw in the mezzanine

34:01.801 --> 34:03.409
was not john hannigan.

34:03.534 --> 34:07.538
It was the bathroom attendant.

34:07.700 --> 34:09.409
They switched places.
Here's what happened.

34:09.534 --> 34:12.809
Hannigan needed a dupe,
an accomplice.

34:12.934 --> 34:15.976
He tricked gilson into helping him.

34:16.101 --> 34:19.574
He must've said something like,
"could you do me a favor?

34:19.699 --> 34:22.242
"This is a two-hour show,
there's no intermission,

34:22.367 --> 34:24.275
"i need a cigarette break,
but i can't be seen leaving.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.809
Could you take my place
for a couple of minutes?"

34:26.934 --> 34:29.175
When the lights went down,

34:29.300 --> 34:33.304
they switched places
for eight, maybe ten minutes.

34:33.534 --> 34:36.775
Just long enough
for hannigan to run two blocks

34:36.900 --> 34:40.905
and throw callie esterhas
off the balcony.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.775
Excuse me.
May i say something?

34:46.900 --> 34:48.143
I knew it.

34:48.268 --> 34:50.242
I knew it, i knew it,
i knew it, i knew it!

34:50.367 --> 34:51.876
Oh, i got to call julie.

34:52.001 --> 34:53.676
Natalie, we can't prove it.

34:53.801 --> 34:55.641
Can we?

34:55.766 --> 34:57.009
He's right.

34:57.134 --> 34:59.876
All we have is some nicotine gum
and a wristwatch.

35:00.001 --> 35:03.542
Hannigan's just gonna lawyer up.
He'll deny everything.

35:03.667 --> 35:07.175
I know.
I know, you're right.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.767
Where's the proof?

35:16.333 --> 35:19.609
Captain, i hope this is important.

35:19.734 --> 35:22.876
I have a deadline in 37 minutes.

35:23.001 --> 35:25.208
Make that 36.

35:25.333 --> 35:26.909
Her again.

35:27.034 --> 35:27.942
Do i have to get
a restraining order?

35:28.067 --> 35:30.409
It was just a review.
Get over it.

35:30.534 --> 35:32.308
Mr. Hannigan, this is not
about the review

35:32.433 --> 35:34.109
or what happened to callie esterhas.

35:34.234 --> 35:36.409
This is an entirely
different matter.

35:36.534 --> 35:37.509
Right this way.

35:37.634 --> 35:40.009
That's him.
That's him.

35:40.134 --> 35:41.442
Are you sure?

35:41.567 --> 35:43.609
What the hell is this?

35:43.734 --> 35:45.642
It's okay, miss, he can't hurt you.

35:45.767 --> 35:47.509
Go ahead.
Tell us your story.

35:47.634 --> 35:50.876
Last night
i was downtown at winberries.

35:51.001 --> 35:53.542
I was waiting for some friends,

35:53.667 --> 35:57.475
and he bought me a drink.

35:57.600 --> 35:58.709
A rum and coke.

35:58.834 --> 36:01.642
What? This is crazy.
If you think...

36:01.767 --> 36:03.867
shut up!

36:04.934 --> 36:07.509
Let her finish.
Go on.

36:07.634 --> 36:10.842
I finished the drink, and i...

36:10.967 --> 36:12.509
i felt kind of...

36:12.634 --> 36:16.109
woozy and dizzy.

36:16.234 --> 36:18.409
And he offered to walk me to my car.

36:18.534 --> 36:22.538
And the next thing i knew
i'm in the parking lot,

36:23.333 --> 36:26.208
and i'm fighting,

36:26.333 --> 36:28.942
and he was grabbing me,
and he pulled me down.

36:29.067 --> 36:31.609
This is preposterous.
It wasn't me. I was home.

36:31.734 --> 36:34.542
I was writing all night.

36:34.667 --> 36:35.976
Her story checks out.

36:36.101 --> 36:38.065
Her dress was ripped, and she
has bruises on her shoulder.

36:38.190 --> 36:41.041
I've never seen her
before in my life.

36:41.166 --> 36:44.242
How did she get your business card?
She said you gave it to her.

36:44.367 --> 36:47.154
I have no idea.
Captain, i swear to you.

36:47.279 --> 36:50.921
I was home.
I don't know this girl.

36:51.046 --> 36:54.352
Mr. Hannigan,
this is very important.

36:54.477 --> 36:58.481
I want you to take a good,
long look at this young woman.

36:58.801 --> 37:01.876
Go on, take your time.

37:02.001 --> 37:04.308
Be very careful.

37:04.433 --> 37:06.143
Are you telling me that you...

37:06.268 --> 37:08.842
you've never seen this girl
before she walked in here today?

37:08.967 --> 37:12.971
Yes, sir.
I'm sure.

37:13.567 --> 37:16.043
I'd swear on 100 bibles.

37:16.168 --> 37:18.842
I have never seen
this woman before in my life.

37:18.967 --> 37:20.275
I believe you.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.308
Lieutenant, did you hear
what he just said?

37:22.433 --> 37:23.742
Yes, i did.

37:23.867 --> 37:27.409
Did everyone in this room
hear what he just said?

37:27.534 --> 37:29.409
You're all witnesses.

37:29.534 --> 37:33.538
Mom, can we go home now?

37:34.001 --> 37:35.242
Mom?

37:35.367 --> 37:39.143
Mr. Hannigan, i'd like you
to meet julie teeger.

37:39.268 --> 37:41.542
Julie was in the show that
you reviewed on saturday night.

37:41.667 --> 37:43.542
But you missed her performance

37:43.667 --> 37:46.043
because you snuck off
to murder your girlfriend.

37:46.168 --> 37:47.375
No.
Yeah.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.976
No. She wasn't in the curtain call.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.676
She was in costume.

37:51.801 --> 37:53.275
She was wearing a wig and makeup.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.190
That's right.
That's right.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.909
But in the first half
she had a solo number,

37:58.034 --> 38:01.275
and she looked just like this.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.776
You would've recognized her

38:02.901 --> 38:04.934
if you were there.

38:07.367 --> 38:09.867
I think...

38:10.067 --> 38:11.809
i need to call my lawyer.
Yeah.

38:11.934 --> 38:15.938
We have phones downtown.
You can call from there.

38:17.600 --> 38:20.876
Wait a minute.
Mr. Hannigan...

38:21.001 --> 38:23.901
your review?

38:24.300 --> 38:28.234
She's not too
forgettable now, is she?

38:38.400 --> 38:42.242
Mom, i think this is it.
It's from the admissions office.

38:42.367 --> 38:44.242
Dean of admissions.
Okay, you open it.

38:44.367 --> 38:46.143
No, i can't.
I'm too nervous.

38:46.268 --> 38:47.409
Mr. Monk, you open it.

38:47.534 --> 38:49.976
I'd be happy to.

38:50.101 --> 38:53.442
I'll call you later.
Let you know what it says.

38:53.567 --> 38:55.133
Where are you going?

38:55.258 --> 38:56.809
Wall my...

38:56.934 --> 38:58.750
all my letter-opening
equipment is at home.

38:58.875 --> 39:01.198
No, open it now.
Here. Here.

39:02.700 --> 39:05.642
Okay, but you understand,

39:05.767 --> 39:07.509
it's not going
to be perfectly straight.

39:07.634 --> 39:09.342
Got that.
Okay.

39:09.467 --> 39:12.167
Here we go.

39:13.634 --> 39:16.175
It's the big moment.

39:16.300 --> 39:18.967
<i>El grande... moment.</i>

39:32.767 --> 39:34.375
Are you excited?

39:34.500 --> 39:36.168
Used to be.
Open it.

39:55.078 --> 39:57.003
Are you ready?

39:57.128 --> 39:58.304
Yes.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.800

Okay, that makes the zip 98920.

40:35.234 --> 40:36.275

40:36.400 --> 40:38.375
Read it.
Read it.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.942

40:40.067 --> 40:41.542

40:50.967 --> 40:52.609
My god, we have to
go celebrate. Come on.

40:52.734 --> 40:55.676
No, no, no, wait, whoa.

40:55.801 --> 40:58.109
'scuse me.
I'm not finished here.

40:58.234 --> 41:02.238
