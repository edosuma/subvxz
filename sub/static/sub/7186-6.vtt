00:12.613 --> 00:14.279

00:29.964 --> 00:32.931

00:58.559 --> 01:00.125
Ha-har!

01:01.661 --> 01:03.195
Ahoy, mateys!

01:03.197 --> 01:05.864
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.267 --> 01:08.267
Great!

01:08.269 --> 01:09.968
To start
today's adventure,

01:09.970 --> 01:12.704
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.606
Yo-ho-ho!

01:14.608 --> 01:16.575
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.577 --> 01:17.843
One more time.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.678
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.883 --> 01:26.351
<i>[Jake]</i> Race-Around Rock!

01:26.353 --> 01:31.290
I'm bored, Smee!
Bored out of my coconut!

01:31.292 --> 01:33.358
I don't know
what to do next!

01:33.360 --> 01:36.028
I want some real excitement.

01:36.030 --> 01:38.097
- Something fun! Like...
- [bell clangs]

01:38.099 --> 01:39.832
What's this?

01:39.834 --> 01:42.167
Bah! It's those puny pirates.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.336
What are they up to now?

01:44.338 --> 01:49.041
[chuckling] Oh, no doubt
something fun and exciting,
cap'n.

01:49.043 --> 01:51.844
Quick! Hide inside
this old shipwreck.

01:51.846 --> 01:57.049
A little pirate spying
shall reveal their fun plans.

01:57.884 --> 02:00.219
[all] Sail wagons, ho!

02:02.689 --> 02:06.325
Awesome sail wagon, Jake!
And I love your sword sail.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.828
Thanks, Izzy! Your pixie
dust sail is cool, too.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.865
Mateys,
check out my ride!

02:12.867 --> 02:17.169
I call it <i>Rollin' Coconuts!</i>

02:17.171 --> 02:20.405
Ah, coconuts!
My wheel fell off.

02:20.407 --> 02:25.144
I need to fix it
or I'm out of the
race to Race-Around Rock.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.646
[Smee] Ooh,
Race-Around Rock!

02:27.648 --> 02:30.649
I've heard many a pirate tale
about it, cap'n.

02:30.651 --> 02:34.353
'Tis said to be one of
Peter Pan's favorite places.

02:34.355 --> 02:38.357
Smee, I am not bored anymore.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.093
Beating those puny pirates
in their race

02:41.095 --> 02:44.263
will be so much fun!

02:44.265 --> 02:46.899
Don't worry, Cubby!
We're a team.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.934
We'll help fix
your sail wagon.

02:48.936 --> 02:54.373
- Ready, Izzy... Lift!
- Stand clear, me hearties!

02:54.375 --> 02:57.376
<i>Rollin' Coconuts</i>
<i>is ready to roll!</i>

02:57.378 --> 02:59.444
Yo-ho, way to go!

02:59.446 --> 03:01.446
Where's the
starting line, Cubby?

03:01.448 --> 03:05.317
The race starts at the
top of Never Peak Mountain.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.386
Way up here.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.389
Then it winds down
Never Peak Trail,

03:10.391 --> 03:12.457
through Mystery Tunnel,

03:12.459 --> 03:15.294
and ends here, at
Race-Around Rock!

03:15.296 --> 03:20.199
Hey, mateys, wanna race
with us to Race-Around Rock?

03:21.367 --> 03:25.237
Great! Remember to keep
a lookout for gold doubloons.

03:25.239 --> 03:28.740
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.377
Then we'll collect them
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest!

03:32.379 --> 03:34.379
Is everybody ready?

03:34.381 --> 03:35.781
I got my sword!

03:35.783 --> 03:37.216
I got my map!

03:37.218 --> 03:39.384
And I've got
my pixie dust!

03:39.386 --> 03:42.821
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.823
But only in emergencies!

03:44.825 --> 03:48.927
Yo-ho, drivers. Let's
go find the starting line.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.001
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

03:56.003 --> 03:58.303
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

03:58.305 --> 03:59.871
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

03:59.873 --> 04:03.342
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

04:03.344 --> 04:06.311
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

04:06.313 --> 04:08.180
<i>¶ And me </i>

04:10.917 --> 04:14.353
Quickly, Smee!
Tear apart this shipwreck.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.922
Build me a Hook-wagon!

04:16.924 --> 04:20.058
When their race
to Race-Around Rock begins,

04:20.060 --> 04:25.297
I, Captain Hook, shall be
in it, uh, to win it!

04:27.267 --> 04:28.533
[Skully] Ahoy, me hearties!

04:28.535 --> 04:32.337
Welcome to the downhill run
to Race-Around Rock!

04:32.339 --> 04:37.442
Whoa. I'm not so sure
my sail wagon's gonna
make it all the way.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.478
You'll make it, Cubby.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.179
We'll be right there
with ya.

04:41.181 --> 04:45.384
OK, mateys!
Ready... get set...

04:45.386 --> 04:47.319
[horn honking]

04:47.321 --> 04:48.887
[all] Captain Hook?!

04:48.889 --> 04:52.524
And his dashing,
piratey Hook-Wagon.

04:52.526 --> 04:57.963
I assume all are welcome
to join in the run
to Race-Around Rock?

04:57.965 --> 05:00.932
Sure, Captain Hook,
the more the merrier!

05:00.934 --> 05:02.401
Glad to hear it.

05:02.403 --> 05:06.938
Now, if you'll excuse me,
so long, puny pirates!

05:06.940 --> 05:10.909
Last one across the finish
line is a rotten codfish!

05:10.911 --> 05:12.377
[laughing]

05:12.379 --> 05:15.347
Go, me hearties,
go, go, go!

05:15.349 --> 05:18.417
[Hook shouting]

05:18.419 --> 05:21.086
[Smee] Oh, dear me!
I can't look!

05:22.488 --> 05:24.523
[Skully] You're catchin' up
to ol' Feather Hat!

05:24.525 --> 05:27.292
Blast!
They're right behind us.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.361
Quick, Smee,
slow them down.

05:30.229 --> 05:31.296
[grunts]

05:35.001 --> 05:38.370
Yay-hey, no way!
Barrels, ho!

05:38.372 --> 05:41.173
Zig-zag, mateys, zig-zag!

05:44.444 --> 05:46.111
Barnacles!

05:49.215 --> 05:52.884
No one passes Captain Hook,
little Jake!

05:52.886 --> 05:54.886
Look again, Captain Hook!

05:58.991 --> 06:04.496
- [kids shouting gleefully]
- Fie on you, popinjays!

06:04.498 --> 06:06.131
Um, sir...?

06:06.133 --> 06:07.165
Rocks!

06:09.168 --> 06:11.103
Oh, bilge water!

06:11.105 --> 06:14.005
[Smee] Are we having fun yet,
cap'n? Oh.

06:14.007 --> 06:17.642
Yo-ho, mateys!
We're zoomin' up
on Razor Ridge!

06:17.644 --> 06:19.444
[Izzy] Shiver me timbers!

06:19.446 --> 06:23.181
Our sail wagons are too wide
to fit on that narrow path!

06:23.183 --> 06:26.418
We'll just have to
tip-'em-on-two! Like this.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.154
[both] Wahoo!

06:32.592 --> 06:35.427
Awesome! We made it!

06:35.429 --> 06:37.662
And we got three
gold doubloons!

06:37.664 --> 06:40.031
Let's grab 'em and go!

06:41.200 --> 06:43.668
Smee, doesn't
that path look narrow?

06:43.670 --> 06:49.441
Thundering blunderbuss!
Leap out and push, Smee.

06:49.443 --> 06:52.144
Leaping, sir. [grunts]

06:52.146 --> 06:54.546
Pushing, sir. [groans]

06:57.150 --> 07:00.719
Crackers!
Crumble Canyon dead ahead.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.491
[Cubby] Ah, coconuts!

07:07.560 --> 07:10.962
I lost my wheel
for good this time.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.497
I guess
I'm out of the race.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.033
Yay-hey, no way, Cubby!

07:15.035 --> 07:17.702
You just need a tiny
pinch of pixie dust.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.406
Floatin' coconuts!

07:21.408 --> 07:24.443
I'm back in the race!
Thanks, Izzy.

07:24.445 --> 07:27.579
Anytime! We made it
across Crumble Canyon

07:27.581 --> 07:30.182
and got four more
Gold Doubloons.

07:30.184 --> 07:32.484
Let's grab 'em
and go, go, go.

07:34.487 --> 07:40.358
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear me!

07:40.360 --> 07:42.727
Smee, we didn't make it.

07:42.729 --> 07:46.298
But at least we're safe, sir.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.467
- [both scream]
- [crashing sounds]

07:50.203 --> 07:52.704
Look! It's the old
Twisty Tree.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.273
It makes a big
loop-the-loop!

07:55.275 --> 07:58.043
<i>Rollin' Coconuts</i>
<i>will never make it!</i>

07:58.045 --> 07:59.444
Sure it will, Cubby.

07:59.446 --> 08:02.581
Just lean in and get
as much speed as you can!

08:04.350 --> 08:06.418
Whoa!

08:06.420 --> 08:09.588
Yo-ho! Whoo!

08:09.590 --> 08:12.524
You can do it, Cubby!

08:12.526 --> 08:15.427
[Cubby] Coconuts!

08:15.429 --> 08:19.164
We did it!
We all looped-the-loop.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.466
And got three more
gold doubloons!

08:21.468 --> 08:23.735
Let's grab 'em and go!

08:26.472 --> 08:29.374
Hang on to your
stocking cap, Smee.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.643
We're going around
the loopy-thing!

08:31.645 --> 08:34.513
I was afraid you'd
say that, sir.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.415
I think we're going to...

08:37.417 --> 08:40.218
- Make it, sir?
- [crashing]

08:40.220 --> 08:42.254
[Smee sighs]

08:44.290 --> 08:46.491
Comin' up on
Mystery Tunnel!

08:46.493 --> 08:51.062
Crackers! Which tunnel
leads to Race-Around Rock?

08:51.064 --> 08:53.598
Three ways in,
three sail wagons.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.734
Let's each take
a different cave!

08:55.736 --> 08:58.737
Yo-ho, let's go!

09:01.340 --> 09:03.408
[all shouting]

09:10.750 --> 09:14.152
It's neck and neck as
they enter the home stretch!

09:15.221 --> 09:17.589
Crackers! Is it gonna be a tie?

09:17.591 --> 09:20.792
Excuse me, mateys,
comin' through!

09:20.794 --> 09:23.762
And it's <i>Rollin' Coconuts</i>
<i>for the win!</i>

09:23.764 --> 09:25.297
Whoo-hoo!

09:25.299 --> 09:27.499
[both] Yo-ho,
way to go, Cubby!

09:27.501 --> 09:30.268
Thanks, but I could
never have made it

09:30.270 --> 09:32.470
without help
from my mateys.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.839
[Hook] Faster, Smee, faster!

09:34.841 --> 09:39.444
[stammering] Going as
fast as I can, cap'n!

09:39.446 --> 09:42.814
I've done it!
I win! I win!

09:42.816 --> 09:46.318
Sorry, Captain Hook,
but Cubby won today's race.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
He crossed the
finish line first!

09:48.322 --> 09:50.722
Double blast and triple fie.

09:50.724 --> 09:54.526
All this frantic
racing for nothing!

09:54.528 --> 09:57.462
Um... not exactly,
Captain Hook.

09:57.464 --> 10:03.201
Check out Race-Around Rock,
the windiest place
on Never Land!

10:03.203 --> 10:07.505
Perfect for racing our awesome
sail wagons over the dunes.

10:07.507 --> 10:10.575
Come on, mateys,
let's ride!

10:11.510 --> 10:13.478
You too, Captain Hook.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.447
Shall we, Smee?

10:15.449 --> 10:19.317
Indeed we shall, cap'n.
Hang on!

10:19.319 --> 10:21.720
Ya-hoo!

10:21.722 --> 10:26.424
Yo-ho, here I go!
Whoo-hoo!

10:27.560 --> 10:29.294
Yeah!

10:29.296 --> 10:32.430
[laughing,
indistinct chattering]

10:32.432 --> 10:37.369
My word, Smee,
we're having such fun now!

10:38.337 --> 10:40.572
[Jake laughs] Yay-hey!

10:45.478 --> 10:48.747
Thanks for helping us
reach Race-Around Rock,
mateys!

10:48.749 --> 10:50.649
Now let's count
our gold doubloons

10:50.651 --> 10:52.917
and put 'em in
our Team Treasure Chest.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.460
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:02.462 --> 11:04.529
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:04.531 --> 11:06.564
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:06.566 --> 11:09.401
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:09.403 --> 11:12.170
Come on, count with us!

11:12.172 --> 11:14.539
[all] Yeah!

11:15.841 --> 11:17.876
[Jake] One, two, three...

11:17.878 --> 11:21.479
[Izzy] Four, five,
six, seven...

11:21.481 --> 11:24.282
[Cubby] Eight, nine, ten!

11:24.284 --> 11:27.452
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today

11:27.454 --> 11:30.889
we got ten gold doubloons.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.224
Now we just need
to find a coconut

11:33.226 --> 11:34.793
to fix my
sail wagon's wheel

11:34.795 --> 11:36.928
before the
pixie dust wears off.

11:36.930 --> 11:40.699
Good idea, Cubby.
A race to Coconut Grove!

11:40.701 --> 11:42.901
Last one there's
a rotten coconut!

11:42.903 --> 11:46.271
[all laughing,
excited chattering]

11:52.445 --> 11:55.914
Hang on, cap'n, another jump!

11:55.916 --> 11:58.550
[both laughing]

12:01.854 --> 12:04.789
Smee, save me!

12:04.791 --> 12:08.526
I was just about to ask you
the very same thing, cap'n!

12:08.528 --> 12:10.695
Oh, oh, oh!

12:10.697 --> 12:12.430
[laughing]

12:16.402 --> 12:18.770
[Jake] Captain Hook is Missing!

12:18.772 --> 12:22.974
- [men snoring]
- [alarm ringing]

12:22.976 --> 12:26.344
[both shouting, grunt]

12:26.346 --> 12:27.879
Wakey time already?!

12:27.881 --> 12:30.348
Quickly, boys,
we need to get ship-shape

12:30.350 --> 12:32.751
for the cap'n's
morning inspection.

12:33.819 --> 12:37.021
- Attention!
- [seagulls crying]

12:37.023 --> 12:39.758
Uh... Where's
the cap'n?

12:39.760 --> 12:42.761
Yeah, he's usually
bellowin' orders by now.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.263
Well, he did have
a late night.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.632
Maybe he's sleepin' in?

12:48.601 --> 12:49.701
Cap'n?

12:50.803 --> 12:52.937
Oh, my!

12:54.507 --> 12:57.609
- Cap'n?
- Oh, Cap'n?!

12:57.611 --> 13:00.011
Oh, Captain Hook!

13:00.013 --> 13:01.846
[both sputtering]

13:01.848 --> 13:05.750
- He's not on the ship, sir!
- Well, we're docked.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.820
Maybe he went for a
little walk in the sand.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.688
Aye! He must have
gone ashore.

13:10.690 --> 13:14.025
- Without these?
- Oh, dear!

13:14.027 --> 13:17.529
What's going on?
Where is the cap'n?

13:17.531 --> 13:23.802
And I know some very smart,
clever and brave pirates

13:23.804 --> 13:26.871
who are good at
finding and helping.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.940
Awesome seashell!

13:28.942 --> 13:32.443
Seashell Beach always
has swell seashells.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.478
[bouncing sound]

13:33.480 --> 13:34.979
¶ Oh, where could Captain be?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.315
<i>¶ Oh, where</i>
<i>Oh, where is he? ¶</i>

13:41.320 --> 13:42.921
¶ Oh, where could Captain be?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.889
<i>¶ Did he fall into the sea? </i>

13:44.891 --> 13:46.958
¶ It's not like him
to leave the boat ¶

13:46.960 --> 13:48.993
<i>¶ Especially with</i>
<i>no pants or coat ¶</i>

13:48.995 --> 13:51.830
<i>¶ Oh, where</i>
<i>oh, where is he? ¶</i>

13:51.832 --> 13:56.434
<i>¶ Oh, where could</i>
<i>Captain be? ¶</i>

13:56.436 --> 13:59.437
Ahoy, Sharky and Bones,
Mr. Smee.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.406
Are you looking
for seashells, too?

14:01.408 --> 14:04.409
Seashells? What?
Oh, oh, no!

14:04.411 --> 14:06.611
We're looking
for Cap'n Hook!

14:06.613 --> 14:08.446
Captain Hook
is missing?

14:08.448 --> 14:10.849
Well, if you need
help finding him, we can...

14:10.851 --> 14:13.885
Oh, thank you, Jake!
Thank you!

14:13.887 --> 14:17.121
I'm not so sure that I
want to find ol' Feather Hat.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.456
But, Skully...

14:18.458 --> 14:20.992
Mr. Smee, Sharky
and Bones need our help.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.894
And helping them
find their captain

14:22.896 --> 14:24.395
is the right
thing to do.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.365
Yeah! It's like we're
going on a treasure hunt,

14:27.367 --> 14:29.801
and the treasure is
Captain Hook!

14:29.803 --> 14:33.037
Say, mateys, will you
help us find Captain Hook?

14:34.607 --> 14:37.909
Great! Remember to keep
a lookout for gold doubloons.

14:37.911 --> 14:41.779
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

14:41.781 --> 14:45.483
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.452
Yo-ho, let's go!

14:47.454 --> 14:50.421
[stammers] But, Jake...
Go where?

14:50.423 --> 14:52.423
We have no clue
what to do!

14:52.425 --> 14:56.027
We need some sort of clue to
tell us where to look for Hook.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.696
Footprints ahoy!

14:58.698 --> 15:02.700
Oh, joy, this is
good news! [chortling]

15:03.535 --> 15:05.737
Well, not exactly.

15:05.739 --> 15:11.910
If they are Hook's
footprints then he's headed
straight for Crocodile Creek!

15:11.912 --> 15:14.746
[stammers] Crocodile Creek?!

15:14.748 --> 15:18.883
Oh. Ol' Tick-Tock Croc
he don't like the cap'n.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.985
The cap'n doesn't
like him either!

15:20.987 --> 15:26.190
Why, oh, why would
Captain Hook go to
Crocodile Creek?!

15:26.926 --> 15:28.927
Let's find out!

15:31.997 --> 15:34.933
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

15:34.935 --> 15:37.769
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

15:37.771 --> 15:42.106
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

15:42.108 --> 15:45.476
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

15:45.478 --> 15:47.145
<i>¶ And me </i>

15:48.747 --> 15:51.015
[snoring]

15:54.486 --> 15:56.788
Huh?

15:56.790 --> 15:59.457
- [snoring continues]
- [growls]

16:08.867 --> 16:12.971
- Oh, Captain Hook?
- Huh?

16:12.973 --> 16:16.708
Look! The croc is wearing
Captain Hook's hat!

16:16.710 --> 16:20.478
[stammers] You don't think
he... um... he... um...

16:20.480 --> 16:22.213
- [both] Ate him?
- [all gulp]

16:24.049 --> 16:26.551
Footprints ahoy! Again!

16:26.553 --> 16:28.086
The cap'n must have
dropped his hat

16:28.088 --> 16:30.922
running from the
Tick-Tock Croc! [laughs]

16:30.924 --> 16:34.225
Don't worry cap'n,
we're right behind you.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.662
- [roars]
- [screams]

16:37.664 --> 16:40.131
We can't follow Hook's
footprints until we get past

16:40.133 --> 16:43.201
- ol' Tick-Tock Croc!
- [snarls]

16:43.203 --> 16:47.271
But how? He seems even
more cranky than usual.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.874
[yawning]

16:53.178 --> 16:57.015
It's still pretty early,
maybe he's still tired.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.816
I think
you're right, Cubby.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.819
Maybe if we sing
the croc a lullaby,

17:01.821 --> 17:03.321
he'll go back to sleep.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.090
Then we could safely
sneak past him.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.925
Good idea, Izz!

17:09.561 --> 17:12.263
<i>¶ Hush-a-bye</i>
<i>Sleep a while ¶</i>

17:12.265 --> 17:15.800
<i>¶ Grumpy, grouchy crocodile </i>

17:15.802 --> 17:18.736
<i>¶ Good night, sleep tight </i>

17:18.738 --> 17:22.173
<i>¶ Close your eyes</i>
<i>and say good night ¶</i>

17:24.143 --> 17:27.145
[softly] Yay-hey! We got
the croc to fall asleep

17:27.147 --> 17:29.814
and we got three
Gold Doubloons.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.849
Let's grab 'em and go!

17:35.854 --> 17:37.855
[snoring]

17:39.792 --> 17:41.325
[continues snoring]

17:52.004 --> 17:55.873
Look alive! The cap'n's
footprints! [laughs]

17:55.875 --> 17:58.643
They're headin' right
off the edge of the canyon!

17:59.778 --> 18:04.649
Oh, dear! You don't
think he, um... He...

18:04.651 --> 18:07.885
- Ouchy.
- Mr. Smee, look!

18:07.887 --> 18:10.154
[Smee] It's the cap'n's hook!

18:10.156 --> 18:11.756
Yo-ho, what do ya know!

18:11.758 --> 18:13.758
And more footprints, ahoy!

18:13.760 --> 18:16.327
Oh, thank goodness!

18:16.329 --> 18:20.098
Captain Hook must have used
his hook to slide on this vine,

18:20.100 --> 18:22.667
all the way
across the canyon.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.770
Maybe we can slide
across on the vine, too,

18:25.772 --> 18:28.906
- with these big leaves.
- Let's do it!

18:29.808 --> 18:31.809
Anchors aweigh!

18:31.811 --> 18:33.845
Whee!

18:33.847 --> 18:35.646
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

18:36.949 --> 18:39.317
Be a brave buccaneer,
be a brave buccaneer.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.819
Be a brave buccaneer! [grunts]

18:41.821 --> 18:44.355
All of right!
We made it across the canyon,

18:44.357 --> 18:46.924
and we got two more
gold doubloons.

18:46.926 --> 18:50.795
Let's grab 'em and go follow
Captain Hook's footprints!

18:52.998 --> 18:56.000
- [birds chirping]
- [snoring continues]

19:01.874 --> 19:05.143
Oh, no! The footprints
stop in this field.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.011
And then he vanished?

19:07.013 --> 19:09.113
Well, if we're
gonna find Captain Hook,

19:09.115 --> 19:12.917
- we need another clue.
- [grunts] Teddy bear!

19:12.919 --> 19:15.019
That's not just
any teddy bear,

19:15.021 --> 19:17.088
that's Captain
Cuddly Bear.

19:17.090 --> 19:21.692
That's right, the cap'n
can't sleep without his
Captain Cuddly Bear!

19:21.694 --> 19:24.195
Ya think the cap'n's out here
tryin' to get some sleep?

19:24.197 --> 19:26.931
Or maybe he never
woke up this morning.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.902
Maybe he's still asleep.
Maybe he's sleepwalking!

19:30.904 --> 19:34.972
Bones, exactly where did
you find Captain Cuddly?

19:34.974 --> 19:38.776
Oh, he found me
when he fell from up there!

19:38.778 --> 19:42.213
Up there? But the only
thing up there is the sky,

19:42.215 --> 19:45.283
and Cap'n Hook on the back
of a giant butterfly?!

19:45.285 --> 19:48.319
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my!

19:50.923 --> 19:52.857
[all] Whew!

19:52.859 --> 19:54.292
Ah, thank goodness!

19:54.294 --> 19:57.195
The dear captain landed
safely on that mountain.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.697
But that's Belch Mountain!

19:59.699 --> 20:03.968
It's a volcano
full of hot, hot lava!

20:03.970 --> 20:07.138
Where is Captain Cuddly Bear?

20:07.140 --> 20:11.475
Oh, dear. This is an emergency!

20:11.477 --> 20:15.279
Don't worry, Mr. Smee.
I've got just what we need.

20:15.281 --> 20:17.481
Pixie dust away!

20:21.486 --> 20:22.954
- [snoring]
- [mountain belches]

20:22.956 --> 20:25.122
[gasps]

20:25.124 --> 20:28.059
Blast and barnacles!
Where am I?

20:28.061 --> 20:31.162
I'm not in me bed,
I don't have me teddy bear,

20:31.164 --> 20:33.331
and I'm about to fall into...

20:33.333 --> 20:36.968
- [mountain rumbling]
- ...hot, hot lava!

20:38.103 --> 20:40.438
Look alive, Captain Hook!

20:44.810 --> 20:47.812
Jake?! [grunts]

20:47.814 --> 20:49.947
Yay-hey!
We saved Captain Hook,

20:49.949 --> 20:52.450
and we got three more
gold doubloons!

20:52.452 --> 20:54.986
Let's grab 'em and go.

20:54.988 --> 20:58.956
Mr. Smee, Sharky and Bones?
We found your captain!

20:58.958 --> 21:03.227
- Here you go, Captain Hook.
- Mr. Smee, what is happening?!

21:03.229 --> 21:05.396
You were
sleepwalking, cap'n.

21:05.398 --> 21:09.934
And the little sea pups
helped find you and save you.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.936
Now see here!

21:11.938 --> 21:16.540
Captain Hook never asked
for your puny pirate help!

21:16.542 --> 21:19.443
Yeah, but I, uh...

21:19.445 --> 21:24.282
- Thank you, lad.
- You're welcome, Captain Hook.

21:24.284 --> 21:28.119
And anytime you need
our help, just ask!

21:28.121 --> 21:30.821
Why do these blasted
puny pirates

21:30.823 --> 21:33.791
always have to
meddle in me business?

21:33.793 --> 21:37.328
We're just lucky,
I guess. [chuckling]

21:40.999 --> 21:43.934
Thanks for helping us
find Captain Hook, mateys.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.836
Now let's count
our gold doubloons

21:45.838 --> 21:48.406
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

21:55.914 --> 21:57.948
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:57.950 --> 21:59.984
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:59.986 --> 22:02.053
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

22:02.055 --> 22:04.922
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

22:04.924 --> 22:07.358
Come on, count with us!

22:08.360 --> 22:09.894
[all] Yeah!

22:12.431 --> 22:15.499
[Jake] One, two, three, four...

22:15.501 --> 22:19.337
[Izzy] Five, six,
seven, eight.

22:19.339 --> 22:22.473
[Izzy] Yay-hey! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:22.475 --> 22:24.909
we got eight gold doubloons!

22:26.278 --> 22:28.979
[pretends to snore]

22:28.981 --> 22:32.316
Crackers! Now Jake
is sleepwalking.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.585
Just kidding!
[laughs]

22:34.587 --> 22:37.355
- [all laughing]
- You got me, Jake!

22:39.458 --> 22:42.927
You look like a right
proper cap'n now, cap'n!

22:42.929 --> 22:45.629
Don't forget
Captain Cuddly Bear.

22:45.631 --> 22:48.999
Oh, pish posh!
I'm a pirate captain!

22:49.001 --> 22:52.336
I don't need any
silly stuffed toy.

22:52.338 --> 22:55.473
Now get swabbin',
ye swabbin' swabs!

22:55.475 --> 22:57.441
[all] Aye-aye, cap'n!

23:00.245 --> 23:05.449
- Aww, who's my little
cuddly bear?
- [toy squeaking]

23:08.420 --> 23:10.921
<i>- ¶ I spy </i>

23:40.219 --> 23:43.921
¶ I can see 200 leagues away

23:43.923 --> 23:45.523
<i>¶ I can help us navigate </i>

23:45.525 --> 23:47.591
<i>¶ Across the Never Sea </i>

23:47.593 --> 23:51.462
