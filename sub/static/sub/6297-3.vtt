<i>Previously on</i>
<i>The Borgias...</i>

00:02.051 --> 00:05.192
<i>The French king had been struck</i>
<i>with the Neapolitan disease.</i>

00:05.292 --> 00:06.626
As we had hoped.

00:06.694 --> 00:09.195
King Charles cannot
remain in Naples forever.

00:09.229 --> 00:11.064
The House of Borgia is doomed.

00:11.098 --> 00:14.400
The arms of the House of Sforza
will remain where they belong.

00:14.435 --> 00:18.204
We shall subdue the
arrogance of the Sforzas.

00:18.238 --> 00:21.607
Force them back to
the arms of Rome.

00:21.642 --> 00:24.310
Lucrezia.

00:24.411 --> 00:27.013
My God! A peasant
to a pope's daughter?

00:28.215 --> 00:30.516
Let him be!
Let him be!

00:30.617 --> 00:33.152
He has a terror of food,
since the event.

00:33.220 --> 00:35.421
See him safe to the
monastery in Perugia.

00:35.456 --> 00:37.623
The brothers will arrange
his passage to Rome.

00:37.658 --> 00:39.125
This child has a father.

00:39.226 --> 00:40.326
A stable hand.

00:40.427 --> 00:41.728
Who has come to Rome.

00:41.829 --> 00:42.829
You loved him?

00:42.863 --> 00:44.230
I still do.

00:44.331 --> 00:46.032
You normally work at night?

00:46.066 --> 00:48.434
I must practise my art in
secret, Your Holiness.

00:48.469 --> 00:51.904
You are more Eve than Adam.

00:51.939 --> 00:55.241
We may have a
commission for you.

00:55.275 --> 00:56.843
These celebrations.

00:56.877 --> 00:58.845
Does anyone have any
idea of the cost?

00:58.946 --> 01:01.447
Can one put a price on joy?

01:01.548 --> 01:03.449
No, Holy Father.
It is priceless.

01:03.550 --> 01:07.120
Let Rome be full of joy!

01:07.154 --> 01:08.888
I would gladly
die for you both.

01:08.956 --> 01:11.858
So go now, my love.
I would have you live.

01:11.892 --> 01:15.261
And Lucrezia?
Would you marry her again?

01:15.362 --> 01:17.096
In time.

01:17.164 --> 01:20.066
I mean you no harm, kind sir,
whoever you may be.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.300
Suicide.

01:21.368 --> 01:23.469
A sin even the
pope can't forgive.

01:23.504 --> 01:25.671
Dead men can't confess.

Oh, beautiful.

03:22.222 --> 03:24.390
Oh you like that one for you?

03:24.424 --> 03:25.825
Giovanni.

03:25.893 --> 03:27.493
Cesare!
Good Morning, Sis.

03:27.594 --> 03:28.794
Why are you here?

03:28.896 --> 03:30.329
Let me take you back home.

03:30.397 --> 03:31.898
I would have a look
through the market.

03:31.999 --> 03:34.000
No it's getting... hot.

03:35.202 --> 03:38.204
What's wrong?
Nothing.

03:40.507 --> 03:42.608
You can't hide things
from me, Brother.

03:42.709 --> 03:45.011
I'll take you
through the square.

03:45.112 --> 03:46.913
Cut him down!
It's a boy!

03:47.014 --> 03:48.848
<i>Hurry up!</i>

03:48.916 --> 03:51.217
<i>Give me a hand!</i>
<i>Quickly!</i>

03:51.318 --> 03:53.219
<i>I need a sharper blade.</i>

03:53.253 --> 03:56.422
No! No!

03:56.523 --> 04:00.626
Lucrezia!

04:00.727 --> 04:03.829
LUCREZIA!

04:03.864 --> 04:05.131
No!

04:05.232 --> 04:06.632
Don't look.

04:06.667 --> 04:09.936
Then pluck my eyes out-

04:14.875 --> 04:16.642
You think this is spectacle?

04:16.677 --> 04:17.877
Paolo!

04:17.945 --> 04:20.146
You like to stare at tears?
Go away!

04:26.086 --> 04:30.156
It's all my fault.
It's all my fault.

04:30.257 --> 04:33.459
It's all my fault.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.261
It was a suicide.

04:35.295 --> 04:37.663
I am still to blame.

04:37.764 --> 04:39.765
I took his love.

04:39.866 --> 04:42.268
I took his kindness.

04:42.302 --> 04:46.072
I took his child.

04:46.106 --> 04:50.176
And the pity was,
he loved a Borgia.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.781
Please.
Don't.

04:58.485 --> 05:01.287
Please, my love,
don't blame yourself.

05:01.321 --> 05:03.689
He left a note.

05:03.724 --> 05:07.093
It was a suicide.
He left a note.

05:07.194 --> 05:10.296
"To my Lucrezia,
I bid farewell."

05:34.154 --> 05:36.522
Make way there.
Step aside.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.927
Take care of the body.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.934
Water!
I need warm water!

05:49.036 --> 05:50.536
And a physician!

05:50.570 --> 05:52.471
Yes, Your Eminence.
I want to die.

05:52.539 --> 05:54.440
No.
I want to die, Brother.

05:54.541 --> 05:55.941
Will you not talk
like that, please?

05:55.976 --> 05:56.942
I want to die.

05:57.044 --> 05:59.145
You have a child to care for.

06:03.150 --> 06:05.451
Now we both must die.

06:05.552 --> 06:08.587
Like Paolo.

06:08.655 --> 06:10.056
I'll see to the baby.

06:10.157 --> 06:12.758
You try to sleep.

06:21.401 --> 06:23.769
Can't you quieten him?

06:23.804 --> 06:26.372
The child is hungry,
Your Eminence.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.174
Well, feed him then?

06:28.208 --> 06:31.177
He has yet only fed at
his mother's breast.

06:31.278 --> 06:32.778
You cannot disturb her.

06:32.879 --> 06:35.381
Find a way.

06:35.415 --> 06:37.283
Your Eminence.

06:37.384 --> 06:39.085
Get in there.
Look after her.

06:44.224 --> 06:47.393
St. Peter's pence-

06:47.427 --> 06:50.830
<i>Sanctissimus in Christo</i>
<i>Pater et Dominus noster,</i>

06:50.897 --> 06:52.865
<i>Dominus Alexander.</i>

06:52.899 --> 06:57.803
St. Peter's pence,
St. Peter's pence.

06:57.904 --> 07:00.639
St. Peter's pence.

07:00.707 --> 07:03.142
<i>Divina providentia</i>
<i>Papa Sextus,</i>

07:06.046 --> 07:09.215
<i>cunctis, qui hic adsunt,</i>

07:09.249 --> 07:13.119
<i>Indulgentiam Plenariam</i>
<i>in forma Ecclesiae.</i>

07:13.220 --> 07:15.287
St. Peter's pence.

07:15.322 --> 07:19.825
<i>Rogate Deum pro felici</i>
<i>statu Sanctitatis Suae</i>

07:19.860 --> 07:23.496

07:23.530 --> 07:29.068
We grant to all who contribute
to St. Peter's pence

07:29.136 --> 07:35.040
a plenary indulgence from the
pain and suffering of Purgatory.

07:39.346 --> 07:44.850
<i>Sancti Apostoli Petrus et</i>
<i>Paulus: de quorum potestate-</i>

07:44.885 --> 07:47.553
Not willing to pay for
eternal salvation, Brother?

07:47.654 --> 07:49.955
Cheap at the price surely?

07:50.056 --> 07:52.258
So is talk, Brother.

07:52.359 --> 07:54.660
And dangerous too.

07:54.694 --> 07:56.729
I have even heard
tell of a cardinal

07:56.763 --> 08:00.766
who has changed his
robes from red to brown.

08:01.968 --> 08:04.370
From where do you come?

08:04.471 --> 08:07.072
I was recently the guest of
the good sisters of St. Agnes

08:07.107 --> 08:10.176
whose greetings
I bring you-

08:10.277 --> 08:11.944
and where do we travel to

08:11.978 --> 08:14.880
is the more important
question, is it not?

08:14.915 --> 08:17.583
Important questions all.

08:17.684 --> 08:22.188
Break bread with me, Brother,
and we may discuss them further.

08:22.289 --> 08:25.191
<i>-Patriis et filli</i>

08:25.292 --> 08:28.494
et spiritus sancti.

08:28.528 --> 08:30.830
<i>Amen.</i>

08:30.897 --> 08:32.798
<i>Amen.</i>

08:36.102 --> 08:38.304
<i>Leave us.</i>

08:38.405 --> 08:40.206
Your Eminence.

08:50.150 --> 08:52.117
I've had tragic news, Father.

08:52.219 --> 08:53.652
Oh!

08:53.720 --> 08:57.723
We thought we had hoped
to have banished tragedy.

08:57.757 --> 08:59.525
It's the father of
your daughter's child.

08:59.559 --> 09:02.127
There is a father?

09:02.162 --> 09:03.329
Of course.

09:08.168 --> 09:10.402
He has been found dead.

09:10.437 --> 09:12.137
Where?
In Pesaro?

09:12.172 --> 09:14.139
No, here in Rome.

09:14.241 --> 09:17.243
He dared to come to Rome?

09:17.344 --> 09:20.346
He tried to see her,
and his infant son.

09:20.447 --> 09:22.948
And we would hope
that he failed.

09:22.983 --> 09:25.050
Of course.

09:25.151 --> 09:28.254
And he-

09:28.355 --> 09:31.457
He took his own life.

09:31.558 --> 09:34.360
And our daughter
knows of this?

09:34.461 --> 09:37.162
Yes.

09:37.264 --> 09:39.365
Stupid boy.

09:39.466 --> 09:42.201
To come to Rome.

09:42.269 --> 09:45.971
So you are concerned
about Lucrezia.

09:46.072 --> 09:49.775
And the child.

09:49.876 --> 09:51.877
Why the child?

09:51.978 --> 09:54.480
She won't allow
him near her.

10:08.228 --> 10:10.596
Lucrezia.

10:14.634 --> 10:16.802
Lucrezia!

10:19.105 --> 10:22.408
You have lost someone
we didn't know.

10:22.509 --> 10:25.010
Didn't know of.

10:31.017 --> 10:33.919
Had we known of his
presence here in Rome,

10:34.020 --> 10:36.422
we would have sent him home.

10:42.829 --> 10:47.333
But the act of suicide puts the
sinner beyond the grace of God.

10:47.434 --> 10:49.435
Beyond our pity.

10:49.469 --> 10:54.239
And beyond your
affections, surely.

10:54.274 --> 10:55.841
Hmm?

10:55.942 --> 10:59.044
Sh, sh, sh.

10:59.145 --> 11:02.848
There, there, there.

11:02.882 --> 11:06.652
Your child is crying for you.

11:12.659 --> 11:14.159
Come on, give me your hand.

11:14.260 --> 11:15.861
Give me your hand.

11:15.895 --> 11:19.765
Give me your hand and
raise yourself up.

11:19.866 --> 11:23.369
You must, you must
return to your child.

11:23.470 --> 11:25.971
Come along, come.

11:30.176 --> 11:35.681
Tell us what can we do
to make things right.

11:42.989 --> 11:47.292
Ask Juan.

11:49.996 --> 11:53.165
Sh, sh, sh.
Your Holiness.

11:53.199 --> 11:55.501
Sh, sh, sh.
What's this?

11:55.602 --> 11:57.603
Is it fever?

11:57.704 --> 12:02.107
It will follow, as
night follows day.

12:03.810 --> 12:08.414
Cesare, we must bring
her to her senses.

12:08.515 --> 12:10.349
She blames herself.

12:10.417 --> 12:13.318
Why, pray would she do that?

12:13.353 --> 12:16.188
For entertaining his hopes.

12:16.222 --> 12:18.424
Well, how could
she have done that?

12:19.926 --> 12:23.429
I arranged a meeting.
At my mother's house.

12:23.530 --> 12:24.963
Are you insane?

12:25.031 --> 12:26.532
You married her to a brute!

12:26.566 --> 12:28.133
She found solace
with a stable boy.

12:28.234 --> 12:31.537
He came to Rome!

12:31.638 --> 12:35.441
He died in Rome.

12:38.545 --> 12:41.647
Did Juan have a hand in this?

12:46.986 --> 12:52.224
I will not have this
family torn apart.

12:52.258 --> 12:55.661
And I will see
that child survive.

13:00.967 --> 13:03.268
Your friend is no Dominican.

13:03.369 --> 13:04.570
No.

13:04.671 --> 13:06.572
He is of the capuchin order.

13:06.673 --> 13:08.474
And he always eats with you?

13:08.575 --> 13:12.277
Since my wine was poisoned.

13:12.378 --> 13:14.379
You're safe here.

13:14.481 --> 13:18.584
So it seems.

13:18.618 --> 13:22.187
I would join your order.

13:22.222 --> 13:23.989
And if we refuse you?

13:24.023 --> 13:25.691
Why then, I shall have
to join the capuchins.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.793
But their rule
is not as strict.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.996
Their vows not as binding.

13:31.030 --> 13:33.799
Friar Savonarola is a
Dominican, after all.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.068
He is.

13:36.102 --> 13:41.807
And your order shares his
abhorrence of the Borgia pope.

13:41.841 --> 13:44.409
We would restore the
church, Cardinal.

13:44.511 --> 13:46.111
Brother.

13:46.212 --> 13:48.514
Call me Brother Giuliano.

13:48.615 --> 13:50.816
Since we share the same aims.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.451
Brother Giuliano.

13:52.519 --> 13:56.088
But do we share
the same methods?

13:56.122 --> 14:00.292
That is what I would
discuss with you.

14:00.326 --> 14:03.128
You of all people should
understand, Rodrigo.

14:03.229 --> 14:04.930
The need to see one's child.

14:05.031 --> 14:07.966
It was beyond foolish.

14:08.034 --> 14:10.335
But you can forgive
her, surely?

14:10.436 --> 14:14.039
The question is, can
she forgive herself?

14:22.749 --> 14:24.850
You met this boy?

14:24.884 --> 14:26.385
Barely.

14:26.452 --> 14:28.654
You allowed our mother's house
to play brothel for him.

14:28.688 --> 14:30.656
I know little of
brothels, Brother.

14:30.690 --> 14:32.558
Juan...

14:42.468 --> 14:45.103
Did you meet him?

14:45.171 --> 14:48.373
I saw her meet a peasant at
the fountain of St. Agatha.

14:48.474 --> 14:50.742
If you had a hand
in his death,

14:50.777 --> 14:52.978
now is the time to
confess it to us.

14:57.584 --> 14:59.484
Then I confess.

15:05.291 --> 15:06.992
To what?

15:09.796 --> 15:12.097
That I didn't.

15:15.602 --> 15:16.802
Rodrigo!

15:18.004 --> 15:19.238
Rodrigo!

15:19.305 --> 15:21.106
You would see your
daughter married again?

15:27.747 --> 15:29.348
Perhaps.

15:29.415 --> 15:32.951
Then have that peasant buried
in a pauper's grave, unshriven.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.920
And be thankful he didn't
bring more shame

15:35.021 --> 15:36.722
on your perfect family.

15:46.232 --> 15:49.468
Be careful,
be very careful...

15:49.535 --> 15:53.338
or you might find yourself
wearing peasant shoes.

15:58.945 --> 16:00.746
No, no no.

16:00.780 --> 16:03.749
What you propose
is unthinkable.

16:03.783 --> 16:06.451
I have thought about
it long and hard.

16:06.552 --> 16:09.221
Each and every
cardinal is in his pay.

16:09.255 --> 16:11.823
We have unleashed a
wolf upon this world,

16:11.858 --> 16:14.760
and if we do not act,
he will consume us all.

16:14.794 --> 16:16.261
And how would you
achieve this end?

16:17.363 --> 16:20.399
I have no idea.

16:20.466 --> 16:23.702
But my soul has
crossed that Rubicon.

16:23.770 --> 16:25.070
If there are those
within your order

16:25.171 --> 16:27.172
who would cross
it with me,

16:27.206 --> 16:28.774
we can find a way.

16:28.808 --> 16:31.877
Our brother friar,
Savonarola, in Florence,

16:31.978 --> 16:33.879
prophesied the end of days.

16:33.980 --> 16:39.251
But not the murder
of the Pope of Rome.

16:39.285 --> 16:41.887
Do you dare broach
it with him?

16:41.988 --> 16:44.990
If I did,
and I had his approval,

16:45.091 --> 16:46.992
would I have yours?

16:51.030 --> 16:56.201
You would have mine,
and all within this priory.

17:11.317 --> 17:17.321
You must talk to me, my love.

17:17.423 --> 17:21.827
You are the light of my life,

17:21.861 --> 17:25.931
the light of this family's life.

17:26.031 --> 17:28.734
If that light goes...

17:33.539 --> 17:36.241
I would ask just one
thing of you, Father.

17:36.342 --> 17:38.043
Anything.

17:42.281 --> 17:44.850
Permit my Paolo a
Christian burial.

17:44.884 --> 17:48.053
He is a suicide.
It is impossible.

17:50.490 --> 17:52.457
This note was pinned
to his sleeve.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.062
Yes.
A suicide-

17:57.096 --> 18:00.565
But he could not read
or write, Father!

18:00.666 --> 18:03.668
My Paolo could not
even pen his own name.

18:11.477 --> 18:13.478
So it was murder.

18:15.515 --> 18:18.083
Where is the murderer?

18:19.685 --> 18:22.587
Too close for comfort.

18:24.724 --> 18:28.293
I will not have this
family at war with itself.

18:28.327 --> 18:32.297
And I would have my Paolo
saved from the fires of hell.

18:40.606 --> 18:47.712
And your infant must feed.

19:03.763 --> 19:05.730
His fever grows.

19:13.940 --> 19:21.847
The father of Giovanni
took his own life.

19:21.948 --> 19:23.748
So it seems.

19:28.354 --> 19:31.756
And this poor
child must feed.

19:31.791 --> 19:37.796
So his father must have what
suicides are forbidden.

19:37.864 --> 19:39.965
A Christian burial.

19:43.069 --> 19:44.669
So we admit.

19:44.770 --> 19:46.371
It was no suicide.

19:46.405 --> 19:50.075
No, Rome is a
dangerous place.

19:50.176 --> 19:53.879
Far too dangerous.

19:53.980 --> 19:57.182
Will you perform the rite?

19:57.283 --> 20:00.285
Gladly.

20:09.195 --> 20:13.698
Lucrezia, we ask that you
give this child your breast

20:13.799 --> 20:20.305
so its father may be buried
with the church's blessing.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.809
You have saved my Paolo from
the fires of Hell, Father.

20:24.844 --> 20:27.012
And I love you for it.

20:29.448 --> 20:33.418
Shh, sh.

21:08.454 --> 21:11.456
Holy Father.

21:14.260 --> 21:17.262
Have you come to confess?

21:22.268 --> 21:24.369
That I am sorry.
And-

21:24.470 --> 21:30.275
For what?

21:30.376 --> 21:32.978
For my sister.

21:33.079 --> 21:35.981
And for her loss.

21:38.718 --> 21:45.890
You will choose a bride

21:45.925 --> 21:51.997
in your ancestral homeland,
Spain.

21:52.098 --> 21:55.700
You will travel there

21:55.735 --> 22:00.305
and you will become
the Borgia...

22:00.339 --> 22:02.907
...I always hoped
you would be.

22:18.424 --> 22:22.127
Et ne nos inducas
in tentationem.

22:22.161 --> 22:24.529
Sed libera nos a malo.

22:24.563 --> 22:27.532
Requiem aeternam
dona ei, Domine.

22:30.536 --> 22:33.338
Say goodbye to your
father, my love.

22:41.247 --> 22:43.248
You must cry for me.

22:43.349 --> 22:46.051
For I have no more tears.

22:53.192 --> 22:55.960
Requiescat in pace.
Amen.

22:56.062 --> 22:57.762
Go ahead.

23:04.603 --> 23:07.172
<i>Forward! Forward!</i>

23:15.414 --> 23:17.582
Keep your place.

23:33.399 --> 23:36.701
I admire your artistry.

23:36.802 --> 23:41.606
Ars longa; vita brevis.

23:41.640 --> 23:45.877
But since King Ferrante died,
I find time weighs heavily.

23:45.911 --> 23:49.013
Few have needs of my talents.

23:49.048 --> 23:51.716
Oh, I would use them.

23:51.817 --> 23:56.221
But as an informant,
not as a taxidermist.

23:56.255 --> 23:59.524
I need word on his
troop's movements

23:59.625 --> 24:03.027
and on your king's
intentions.

24:03.129 --> 24:04.429
The king is ill.

24:04.463 --> 24:05.864
How ill?

24:05.931 --> 24:09.667
Too ill to remain
in Naples.

24:09.735 --> 24:14.038
Then I will bide my time
and await for your word.

24:15.141 --> 24:18.843
He has had visitors
from the Romagna.

24:18.878 --> 24:20.745
Of any renown?

24:20.846 --> 24:23.047
Sforzas.

24:23.082 --> 24:27.452
Giovanni and Catherina.

24:27.486 --> 24:29.754
I will visit you again.

24:34.360 --> 24:37.762
And if the king
decides to ride north,

24:37.863 --> 24:39.664
your armies would
ride with his?

24:39.698 --> 24:40.932
Yes.

24:40.966 --> 24:43.168
In return for a
certain consideration.

24:43.269 --> 24:46.371
And this consideration?

24:46.472 --> 24:47.972
His cannon.

24:50.476 --> 24:53.878
You would have him leave his
cannon to the Sforza armies?

24:53.979 --> 24:55.880
Not every piece.

24:55.915 --> 24:58.149
But enough to defend
our castle at Forli.

24:58.184 --> 25:01.886
To replicate the great
fortresses of France.

25:13.332 --> 25:16.935
Giovanni Sforza.

25:17.002 --> 25:21.005
And my cousin, Catherina
Sforza, Your Majesty.

25:21.106 --> 25:24.943
You have many cousins,
I have been told.

25:25.010 --> 25:27.312
Are they all
impotent, like you?

25:32.117 --> 25:34.652
That is a vile
Borgia slander,

25:34.720 --> 25:37.121
perpetrated by
the pope himself.

25:37.156 --> 25:40.358
Which is why you
are here, of course.

25:40.426 --> 25:43.161
<i>You would have a</i>
<i>taste of vengeance.</i>

25:43.229 --> 25:46.364
The Italian appetite
for vengeance

25:46.432 --> 25:48.733
astounds even us,
Lord Sforza.

25:48.767 --> 25:50.268
The Italian appetite
for vengeance

25:50.336 --> 25:52.470
may be boundless,
Majesty,

25:52.538 --> 25:58.543
but happily for you the
Spanish appetite for war is not.

26:32.778 --> 26:39.284
What say you to Donna, to
Donna Gabriella my love?

26:39.385 --> 26:42.053
I say "yes" to
Donna Gabriella!

26:42.087 --> 26:45.189
And to La Marquesa-
La Marquesa Maria.

26:45.224 --> 26:47.792
No!
Isobella-

26:47.826 --> 26:49.594
No!
Juana-

26:49.695 --> 26:51.696
<i>No!</i>

27:10.249 --> 27:13.217
<i>Who is your favourite?</i>

27:13.252 --> 27:18.923
<i>Maria Enrique de Luna.</i>

27:26.131 --> 27:28.132
Forgive me, Brother.

27:28.233 --> 27:30.234
Had I realised-

27:30.269 --> 27:32.437
You're keeping
late hours, Sis.

27:35.074 --> 27:37.108
Not of my choosing, Brother.

27:37.142 --> 27:38.743
Perhaps you could spare a
thought for your nephew

27:38.844 --> 27:42.246
trying to sleep downstairs?

27:42.348 --> 27:44.849
Forgive me Sis.

27:44.883 --> 27:46.718
But-
Bernadetta.

27:46.752 --> 27:50.254
Bernadetta here was
helping me choose a wife.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.858
What do you think
of our favourite-

27:53.959 --> 27:57.762
Maria Enrique de Luna?

27:57.863 --> 28:00.565
She's pretty.

28:00.666 --> 28:03.067
And clearly no peasant.

28:04.169 --> 28:05.970
She is royalty, Sis.

28:06.071 --> 28:08.306
Cousin to Queen Isabella.

28:08.374 --> 28:12.076
So.
You must marry her then.

28:12.177 --> 28:14.579
I have your permission?

28:14.680 --> 28:16.280
You need it?

28:16.315 --> 28:18.783
I need your blessing.

28:18.884 --> 28:20.785
I know you have
been sad of late.

28:22.187 --> 28:25.289
You would have to have
my forgiveness first.

28:25.324 --> 28:26.991
Forgiveness for what?

28:28.994 --> 28:31.095
For being yourself.

28:35.701 --> 28:38.703
You should get back to
the task at hand, Brother,

28:38.737 --> 28:40.905
and I to my lonely bed.

28:40.939 --> 28:43.207
Good night.

28:43.308 --> 28:45.309
Sleep well.

29:28.954 --> 29:33.357
♪ I took a bow and
aimed it low... ♪

29:39.565 --> 29:46.671
♪ And caught you on the
chin-chin-chin... ♪

29:46.772 --> 29:51.476
♪ My mother said,
"Now go to bed. ♪

29:51.577 --> 29:56.380
♪ I'll have to lock
you in, in, in. ♪

30:13.599 --> 30:16.601
Ah!

30:16.702 --> 30:20.304
Help! Help!

30:22.441 --> 30:24.342
My God!
Get her off me.

30:24.409 --> 30:26.511
For the love of God, man,
get her off me!

30:41.226 --> 30:44.128
My lord?

30:46.231 --> 30:47.932
Medics, NOW!

30:48.033 --> 30:49.534
Yes, Your Eminence.

31:31.710 --> 31:36.180
From the Judas Cradle
to the Judas Chair.

31:36.281 --> 31:38.783
He did not enjoy
the cradle, did he?

31:38.884 --> 31:41.085
No, my liege.

31:41.119 --> 31:43.321
I would say he did not.

31:43.388 --> 31:46.090
Maybe the chair will
suit him better.

31:46.124 --> 31:48.192
<i>Angle his head,</i>
<i>if you will.</i>

31:48.293 --> 31:50.494
So he can gaze
at his Saviour.

31:50.596 --> 31:52.096
Yes, Your Majesty.

31:52.130 --> 31:55.032
<i>He is about to betray</i>
<i>him, after all.</i>

31:55.100 --> 31:57.835
<i>We have the sense</i>
<i>of an ending, at least.</i>

31:57.903 --> 32:02.006
Prepare to leave this
abattoir tomorrow.

32:02.107 --> 32:04.408
<i>We leave for Rome.</i>

32:06.311 --> 32:08.613
See you when
I come back next.

32:08.714 --> 32:10.715
Au Revoir.

32:29.368 --> 32:31.936
You have news for me?

32:31.970 --> 32:33.938
He has ordered the
evacuation of Naples.

32:36.174 --> 32:39.043
And the king will travel
with his troops, yes?

32:39.144 --> 32:41.145
And Sforza arms.

32:43.649 --> 32:45.850
It will take days to
gather such an army.

32:45.951 --> 32:47.351
Three at least.

32:47.386 --> 32:49.687
So I must hurry.

32:49.755 --> 32:52.156
This is for
your retirement...

32:52.257 --> 32:53.758
Thank you.

32:53.792 --> 32:56.761
Thank you.

33:04.603 --> 33:06.971
...and for your silence.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.681
I remember so very
little of Spain, Mother.

33:16.782 --> 33:17.982
And if we had stayed,

33:18.016 --> 33:20.384
how different things
could have been.

33:20.485 --> 33:22.787
You have regrets?

33:22.888 --> 33:25.990
Regrets are part of life.

33:26.024 --> 33:27.992
Regret is part of Rome.

33:31.630 --> 33:34.198
Let me serve you, Brother.

33:44.409 --> 33:48.112
You have no regrets
do you, dear Juan?

33:48.213 --> 33:51.615
No burning ones, no.

33:51.717 --> 33:53.884
Good.

33:53.919 --> 33:58.122
Then perhaps I shall
drop in on you unexpectedly...

33:58.223 --> 33:59.423
...one day soon in Spain.

33:59.458 --> 34:00.958
What is it with you
children tonight?

34:01.026 --> 34:03.027
May I make a speech,
Mother?

34:03.061 --> 34:04.729
You may.

34:07.466 --> 34:10.434
We were outsiders
when we came here.

34:10.469 --> 34:12.937
Spaniards,
Catalans.

34:13.038 --> 34:15.438
And we endured
the insults.

34:15.474 --> 34:17.241
The taunts of Murrano.
The...

34:17.275 --> 34:18.743
Bile?

34:18.844 --> 34:21.379
The poison?

34:21.446 --> 34:25.349
The insidious invective
of the Roman nobility.

34:25.449 --> 34:29.453
And you, dear mother,
endured it most of all.

34:29.487 --> 34:33.257
But if we managed to triumph,
and triumph we did,

34:33.291 --> 34:36.893
we did because
of the warmth

34:36.962 --> 34:39.764
that we discovered
around this table.

34:39.864 --> 34:45.668
The warmth of the Spanish sun,
of our Catalan blood,

34:45.704 --> 34:48.672
that you recreated
in your hearth,

34:48.706 --> 34:53.077
in your home,
at this table.

34:53.110 --> 34:58.582
The huge, unstoppable
beating heart of La Madre.

35:00.719 --> 35:01.886
La Madre!

35:01.920 --> 35:03.154
Mother.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.388
Let us drink then.
To-

35:04.489 --> 35:07.691
To family.

35:07.793 --> 35:10.494
To family!

35:26.511 --> 35:27.945
<i>Godspeed, my lord.</i>

35:28.013 --> 35:29.013
<i>Safe journey to you, my lord!</i>

35:29.114 --> 35:30.514
<i>Gonfaloniere!</i>

35:30.549 --> 35:31.949
<i>Farewell, General Borgia.</i>

35:32.017 --> 35:33.517
<i>May you prosper, my lord.</i>

35:33.618 --> 35:36.120
<i>Gonfaloniere, farewell!</i>

35:36.221 --> 35:38.522
<i>God be with you!</i>

35:38.557 --> 35:41.158
<i>Travel well, Gonfaloniere!</i>

35:41.226 --> 35:43.727
<i>Safe journey, my lord!</i>
<i>Our hearts go with you.</i>

35:43.829 --> 35:45.529
<i>God's blessing, my lord!</i>

35:45.564 --> 35:47.798
<i>Farewell my lord!</i>

35:47.833 --> 35:51.936
A sad day to lose a
brother, is it not Cesare?

35:51.970 --> 35:53.637
Indeed.

35:53.738 --> 35:56.941
I wonder that the sun
even dares to shine.

36:21.566 --> 36:24.768
Anyone who rides
that hard has news.

36:24.803 --> 36:26.871
Bad news as always,
Your Eminence.

36:28.206 --> 36:29.773
The king is on the move.

36:29.808 --> 36:31.008
With vengeance in his heart.

36:31.076 --> 36:32.676
He feels he was deceived.

36:32.777 --> 36:34.078
So he was.

36:34.179 --> 36:36.013
A most beautiful deception.

36:36.081 --> 36:37.381
He says he will
use his cannon

36:37.415 --> 36:39.783
to reduce our walls to dust.

36:39.818 --> 36:43.587
He says he will rape Rome as
Rome raped the Sabine women,

36:43.622 --> 36:45.656
that he'll strip her
of her treasures

36:45.690 --> 36:48.092
to make up
for his losses.

36:50.695 --> 36:54.198
How long to move an army of
that size from Naples to Rome?

36:54.299 --> 36:58.602
A week.
Ten days at most.

36:58.637 --> 37:02.806
We must make haste then.

37:02.841 --> 37:05.409
You have a plan?

37:05.443 --> 37:08.612
We fight fire with fire.

37:11.650 --> 37:14.952
You will supervise with
the greatest speed

37:15.020 --> 37:16.854
and the utmost
secrecy,

37:16.922 --> 37:20.024
the construction
of one hundred cannon,

37:20.125 --> 37:22.927
to be mounted on the walls
of this city

37:23.028 --> 37:27.898
and to be ready for
deployment within the week.

37:27.933 --> 37:34.939
Every foundry in Rome will be
suborned for this purpose.

37:35.040 --> 37:38.042
His Eminence will see
that you are furnished

37:38.076 --> 37:41.845
with everything
you may need.

37:41.880 --> 37:44.848
Good luck to you
and god speed.

37:52.691 --> 37:55.159
What of the
consistory, Father?

37:55.260 --> 37:57.561
They will run
again, like rats.

37:57.662 --> 37:58.862
Ah, the consistory.

37:58.897 --> 38:02.766
I may need your help
to convince them.

38:02.867 --> 38:06.370
You tricked the French king
and now he comes for our blood!

38:06.471 --> 38:09.540
Do you expect us to
support you twice?

38:09.574 --> 38:14.178
We will defend Rome
this time with our life.

38:14.279 --> 38:16.580
With your guile again?
Your lies?

38:16.681 --> 38:18.282
Your weasel words?

38:18.316 --> 38:19.883
No.

38:19.918 --> 38:21.285
Then tell us how,
Your Holiness.

38:28.193 --> 38:30.294
With gunpowder.

38:35.133 --> 38:41.572
We have ordered one hundred
cannon, ten times this size.

38:41.606 --> 38:48.145
We will defend this great
city of ours with our lives,

38:48.213 --> 38:53.117
with our funds-
and with our cannon.

38:55.153 --> 38:56.420
Take the other end.

38:56.521 --> 38:57.721
A month?

38:57.756 --> 38:59.623
<i>Per cannon,</i>
<i>per foundry, yes.</i>

39:00.959 --> 39:02.326
I have a first
mould already made--

39:02.360 --> 39:04.228
Every foundry in Rome-
how many are there?

39:04.329 --> 39:05.529
Twenty, maybe thirty but-

39:05.563 --> 39:06.964
Every foundry in
Rome, every smelter,

39:07.032 --> 39:08.632
furnace man
working day and night-

39:08.733 --> 39:10.234
how many might
we make then?

39:10.335 --> 39:12.436
One cannon-
maybe two.

39:12.537 --> 39:13.737
What?

39:13.772 --> 39:15.606
My Lord, our bronze
was all sold.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.207
On orders from
his Holiness.

39:17.242 --> 39:18.842
To pay for the
Great Festivities.

39:28.053 --> 39:29.753
Forgive me, my Lord.

39:29.788 --> 39:32.690
<i>Boy, check the</i>
<i>cart out again.</i>

39:32.757 --> 39:36.193
How like that little cannon
is our great city of Rome.

39:36.261 --> 39:39.463
A fragile illusion
of substance.

39:39.564 --> 39:42.566
Indeed my Lord,
it is but plaster.

39:44.669 --> 39:46.070
<i>The mould is</i>
<i>only half-full.</i>

39:46.171 --> 39:47.571
Why plaster?

39:47.605 --> 39:49.573
Before we cast the
mould in bronze,

39:49.607 --> 39:52.443
we make a sample
in plaster.

39:52.477 --> 39:56.180
And plaster, unlike bronze,
sets fast, is plentiful-

39:56.281 --> 39:57.781
And cheap.

40:02.687 --> 40:04.788
Have you heard,
Brother?

40:04.889 --> 40:06.790
The French are
advancing from Naples.

40:06.825 --> 40:08.592
They will be here
within days.

40:08.626 --> 40:11.695
They may murder the
Borgia pope for you.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.799
He tricked the king once.

40:15.834 --> 40:17.401
And he suffered for it.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.303
He will take his revenge

40:19.404 --> 40:22.706
and spare you the blemish
on your eternal soul.

40:24.309 --> 40:26.343
If I was not now
bound to poverty,

40:26.411 --> 40:29.446
I would take
a wager with you.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.816
Borgia duplicity
might yet undo him.

40:32.851 --> 40:35.619
And I would bet
that you would lose.

40:49.033 --> 40:51.034
Forgive my appearance,
Your Eminence.

40:51.069 --> 40:52.536
We have worked long
hours without sleep and-

40:52.637 --> 40:55.139
I only care about your work,
Signor Vittorio.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.374
The fate of all of us
depends on it.

41:12.457 --> 41:15.659
This is true artistry.

41:15.693 --> 41:17.261
I'm pleased it
pleases you, my lord.

41:17.295 --> 41:18.462
And there are-

41:18.496 --> 41:19.963
Ninety-five more like it

41:20.064 --> 41:21.665
making their way from other
foundries as we speak.

41:21.766 --> 41:24.168
Ha!

41:24.269 --> 41:27.371
Perhaps our fragile illusion
will yet have substance.

41:27.472 --> 41:28.872
It will, my Lord.

41:28.907 --> 41:31.074
Take it from one who knows!

41:53.598 --> 41:54.898
You're a-

41:54.999 --> 41:57.801
Yes, my Lord.

41:57.902 --> 42:00.904
Forgive me, I thought
perhaps your father-

42:00.939 --> 42:02.206
My father?

42:02.307 --> 42:03.607
What does my father-

42:03.708 --> 42:05.709
But clearly I was mistaken.

42:14.118 --> 42:17.321
Is nothing in this damned
city what it seems?

42:22.727 --> 42:25.729
At least I know you
can keep a secret.

42:43.448 --> 42:45.449
The French envoy still awaits
your word, Holy Father.

42:45.550 --> 42:47.417
I know.

42:47.452 --> 42:48.552
He's been waiting
all night.

42:48.586 --> 42:50.254
I know, I know!

42:52.557 --> 42:58.662
King Charles merely asks for
safe passage through Rome.

42:58.763 --> 43:01.765
To rape and pillage
in safety!

43:01.799 --> 43:03.767
He has reason
enough to hate us.

43:03.801 --> 43:05.636
As do Catherina and
Giovanni Sforza.

43:05.670 --> 43:09.373
A holy trinity
of vengeance.

43:09.407 --> 43:11.975
Shall we have our
cannon, my son?

43:18.883 --> 43:21.685
<i>Take the other end.</i>

43:21.786 --> 43:23.186
<i>Place more men here.</i>

43:30.595 --> 43:33.597
<i>More rope on the tackle!</i>

43:33.631 --> 43:35.999
You need to
trust me, Father.

43:36.034 --> 43:37.901
For once.

43:42.440 --> 43:48.211
Tell that envoy that Rome is
more than just her walls.

43:48.313 --> 43:51.048
She is the Eternal City

43:51.115 --> 43:57.020
and she will not be
raped and deflowered.

43:57.055 --> 44:01.525
Tell him Rodrigo Borgia
spake these words.

44:17.075 --> 44:18.942
Whoa!

44:21.279 --> 44:22.913
I have word for the king.

44:22.947 --> 44:25.248
You are denied entry
to Rome, my liege.

44:25.350 --> 44:27.551
Are they mad?

44:27.652 --> 44:31.188
Your Spanish pope has
more appetite for war

44:31.255 --> 44:35.559
than you imagined,
Lady Catherina.

44:38.463 --> 44:44.468
So we must will ourselves
to battle once more.

44:50.475 --> 44:52.309
You think the blood
of the Borgia pope

44:52.377 --> 44:55.312
could cure us,
Catherina Sforza?

44:55.380 --> 44:57.981
We could bathe in it
together, Majesty.

45:11.329 --> 45:13.096
<i>Pull the weights!</i>

45:13.131 --> 45:14.898
<i>There is no weight, sir.</i>

45:14.999 --> 45:16.500
You must be getting stronger!

45:18.202 --> 45:19.403
<i>Steady!</i>

45:19.504 --> 45:20.804
<i>You there!</i>

45:20.905 --> 45:22.172
<i>Pull it all the way forward.</i>

45:22.206 --> 45:23.306
<i>Bring it in!</i>

45:23.408 --> 45:24.808
<i>Careful!</i>

45:26.344 --> 45:28.378
<i>It's useless.</i>

45:28.413 --> 45:30.447
What's this?
Look at this.

45:30.515 --> 45:33.717
Yes, We'll have no a problem
beating them now, lads.

45:33.751 --> 45:35.919
We've got a
fucking toy cannon.

45:43.761 --> 45:45.929
Oh no!
What happened?

45:45.963 --> 45:47.731
Is he dead?

45:50.234 --> 45:52.636
You will pretend these
cannons have weight-

45:52.737 --> 45:55.639
-that they are real.

45:55.740 --> 45:57.574
As real as this.

45:57.642 --> 45:59.943
<i>Armature!</i>

46:01.179 --> 46:02.245
Yes sir.

46:02.346 --> 46:03.647
Back to work.

46:03.748 --> 46:04.948
Armature!

46:05.049 --> 46:07.751
Present pilum!

46:07.852 --> 46:10.954
Bring the next one up.

46:10.988 --> 46:12.355
Will it pass?

46:12.390 --> 46:14.458
Barely.
Let's pray.

46:18.162 --> 46:21.998
How long to batter
the walls apart?

46:22.066 --> 46:24.568
The walls are 10 foot thick,
my liege.

46:24.602 --> 46:26.770
Twelve hours of fire
should achieve it.

46:26.804 --> 46:28.972
Twelve hours of cannon fire.

46:29.006 --> 46:30.674
Could I perhaps
sleep through it?

46:32.210 --> 46:35.579
If Your Highness
puts wax his ears.

46:35.680 --> 46:37.380
The fever returns?

46:37.415 --> 46:40.450
It never leaves us,
Catherina Sforza.

46:40.485 --> 46:43.587
But the smell of battle
will be its own medicine.

46:45.590 --> 46:47.591
It does quicken the blood.

47:02.306 --> 47:05.008
And what does your son
know about artillery?

47:05.109 --> 47:06.443
I know enough.

47:06.511 --> 47:07.878
And of combat, if
it comes to it?

47:07.912 --> 47:11.515
Again, I know enough and
it will not come to that.

47:24.128 --> 47:26.930
Can you be sure?

47:32.737 --> 47:35.338
Go with God, my son.

47:40.745 --> 47:42.946
Push!

47:50.288 --> 47:52.055
<i>Take your positions!</i>

47:52.089 --> 47:54.357
<i>Men in position!</i>

47:56.160 --> 47:58.061
<i>All ready.</i>

47:59.363 --> 48:01.264
Open the gates!

48:01.365 --> 48:03.066
<i>Open the gates!</i>

48:44.408 --> 48:47.611
You make a manly figure
on your horse, Cardinal.

48:47.712 --> 48:50.847
But the French cannon will
soon break down your walls.

48:50.915 --> 48:53.316
And you will be impotent
in the face of them.

48:54.619 --> 48:58.922
My walls may yet prove stronger
than you think, my lady.

48:58.956 --> 49:00.323
Passer pour le roi!

49:00.424 --> 49:01.524
The King!

49:01.559 --> 49:04.127
Make way!

49:04.161 --> 49:06.529
Move to your left!

49:11.969 --> 49:15.372
We have Italian friends,
Cardinal Borgia,

49:15.439 --> 49:18.241
but our business
is all French.

49:18.342 --> 49:19.943
And that business is?

49:19.977 --> 49:23.146
To gain entry to
the city of Rome.

49:23.180 --> 49:27.550
The easy way, or the hard.

49:27.585 --> 49:31.755
You have decorated the walls of
Rome with flags and pennants.

49:31.789 --> 49:33.857
To welcome us, we presume.

49:33.958 --> 49:36.159
Your Highness is
indeed welcome.

49:36.260 --> 49:37.961
To march on past Rome.

49:44.602 --> 49:49.873
I warn you, Cardinal,
I shall raze your city!

49:49.974 --> 49:52.075
Take terrible revenge!

49:52.176 --> 49:56.479
On you, your family,
and the papacy itself!

49:56.580 --> 49:58.181
You must enter first.

49:58.215 --> 50:00.083
My cannon will gain me entry.

50:00.184 --> 50:01.785
Twelve hours,
I have been assured-

50:01.819 --> 50:05.055
to batter down
those walls.

50:05.089 --> 50:08.291
Perhaps my cannon will make
their statement first.

50:19.904 --> 50:21.604
Cannons forward!

50:21.639 --> 50:24.507
Forward!

50:30.214 --> 50:32.015
Rams!

50:32.116 --> 50:34.617
<i>Rams ready!</i>

50:45.229 --> 50:47.430
<i>More cannon balls!</i>
<i>Quickly, quickly!</i>

50:49.333 --> 50:51.234
How did he manage to...

50:57.241 --> 50:58.508
General?

50:58.542 --> 51:01.144
Our battle line is still
forming, my liege.

51:04.482 --> 51:06.449
Load, load!

51:12.757 --> 51:16.059
I must compliment Your
Highness on his ingenuity.

51:16.093 --> 51:18.294
Chained cannonballs can
take apart a regiment

51:18.362 --> 51:22.866
like a knife
through butter.

51:24.902 --> 51:29.005
Are you not well,
your Highness?

51:29.073 --> 51:31.274
We have the
Neapolitan fever.

51:32.476 --> 51:34.911
Perhaps battle
should wait then.

51:34.979 --> 51:37.614
Until his full
health returns.

51:37.681 --> 51:39.883
Or perhaps he should
trace his gracious path

51:39.917 --> 51:44.788
home to fair France.

52:16.520 --> 52:18.588
Do I give the signal,
my liege?

52:18.622 --> 52:21.024
Do I look like a fool,
General?

52:21.125 --> 52:22.826
No, my liege.

52:25.629 --> 52:28.331
We ride on past.

52:32.436 --> 52:34.437
Retreat!

52:35.573 --> 52:37.040
Retreat!

52:39.977 --> 52:42.946
<i>Come down and retreat!</i>

53:01.866 --> 53:04.968
Do you know what
that sound is?

53:05.002 --> 53:09.873
It is the sound
of our salvation.

53:09.974 --> 53:11.875
Deo gratias!

53:11.976 --> 53:13.276
The French are leaving!

53:18.883 --> 53:20.083
It's a miracle!

53:20.184 --> 53:24.020
<i>God is great!</i>

53:40.704 --> 53:42.205
Your Holiness.

53:42.239 --> 53:43.907
Father!

53:44.008 --> 53:45.608
They're leaving Rome.

53:45.709 --> 53:47.810
Father!

53:47.845 --> 53:49.312
Oh, thank God.

53:49.413 --> 53:50.813
Thank God.

53:53.417 --> 53:56.219
My son.

53:56.253 --> 54:00.023
We should melt down
that bell, Holy Father.

54:00.057 --> 54:02.125
Why melt it down?

54:02.226 --> 54:04.427
To make cannon.

54:06.530 --> 54:09.332
Real cannon, this time.

54:17.341 --> 54:20.443
Cesare, your genius worked!

54:20.477 --> 54:21.744
HA!

54:24.682 --> 54:26.149
So clever!
