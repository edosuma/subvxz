WEBVTT

00:08.599 --> 00:12.182
<i>In the five weeks
since our return from PX7-941...</i>

00:12.198 --> 00:14.192
Known to its population as Madrona.

00:14.278 --> 00:16.900
...we've processed
most of the data we collected.

00:16.958 --> 00:20.873
We think we've corroborated
some startling first-hand observations.

00:20.879 --> 00:23.120
- Which are?
- Well, sir,...

00:23.199 --> 00:26.734
...the inhabitants can proactively
affect their own climate.

00:26.759 --> 00:29.428
That's a bit of an understatement!

00:29.478 --> 00:33.347
They can call it up...
just like... that.

00:33.359 --> 00:35.399
<i>You got a crop that needs water?</i>

00:35.478 --> 00:37.472
Order some rain.

00:37.557 --> 00:40.808
It needs sun, it's literally
a matter of dialling it up.

00:40.838 --> 00:43.840
Are you sure you weren't
under the local voodoo?

00:43.878 --> 00:46.881
Believe me, General,
no one was more scepticaI than I.

00:46.917 --> 00:50.750
But we may have stumbled on
the most important piece of technology...

00:50.759 --> 00:53.084
...the SGC mission has discovered to date.

00:54.277 --> 00:56.435
Even the Goa'uld
have no such technology.

00:56.518 --> 00:58.308
You think you know how they do it?

00:58.398 --> 01:02.017
Our best theory is that the planet
was terraformed about 900 years ago.

01:02.037 --> 01:06.831
<i>The Madronans are primitive, so it's likely
it was terraformed by another alien race.</i>

01:06.798 --> 01:09.468
The weather seems to be
regulated by this device.

01:09.516 --> 01:12.055
<i>The Madronans
call it the Touchstone.</i>

01:12.117 --> 01:16.447
It's an ancient artefact, probably
made by the other alien race.

01:17.396 --> 01:20.563
It's right there. It's in the statue's hand.

01:20.597 --> 01:23.349
The high priest turns
a series of calibrated rings,...

01:23.396 --> 01:26.185
...which seem to determine
meteorological conditions.

01:26.237 --> 01:28.694
Do we have any idea what makes it tick?

01:28.757 --> 01:30.998
That's why we'd like to go back, sir.

01:31.076 --> 01:36.498
Carter wants to get a closer look with
some of her specialised... doohickeys.

01:36.436 --> 01:38.014
Doohickeys?!

01:38.115 --> 01:41.152
I believe that's the technicaI term, sir!

01:42.075 --> 01:45.411
My instruments will measure
the Touchstone's emissions...

01:45.436 --> 01:47.179
...and give us an idea of how it works.

01:47.277 --> 01:49.849
Any chance we could
borrow it for a few days,...

01:49.915 --> 01:52.039
...do a little backward engineering?

01:52.115 --> 01:55.283
The Touchstone maintains
the weather on this planet.

01:55.317 --> 01:57.310
Right.

01:58.075 --> 02:01.112
OK, then. Go see what you can figure out.

02:03.194 --> 02:04.439
OK.

02:17.594 --> 02:19.090
Greetings, Roham.

02:19.194 --> 02:21.687
Princess La Moor.

02:23.115 --> 02:27.161
- It's the visitors, Uncle.
- We demand you return the Touchstone!

02:28.155 --> 02:29.897
What? I-It's missing?

02:29.995 --> 02:33.079
Do not play games.
You must return it at once!

02:34.033 --> 02:36.276
No games. We didn't take it.

02:36.353 --> 02:40.139
It is gone! Come! See for yourselves!

03:21.792 --> 03:23.998
This explains the storm clouds out there.

03:24.073 --> 03:26.195
Without the Touchstone to shield us,...

03:26.271 --> 03:29.143
...we shall soon be overtaken
by the elements.

03:29.193 --> 03:33.486
It's only a matter of time before
we begin to die because of your theft.

03:33.473 --> 03:35.098
<i>All right.</i>

03:35.192 --> 03:37.185
Here's a question for you.

03:37.271 --> 03:40.391
If it was so important,
why wasn't it guarded?

03:40.430 --> 03:43.883
<i>It was guarded. We let down our guard
because of your people.</i>

03:43.912 --> 03:47.163
<i>- We trusted you.
- We did not take it!</i>

03:47.192 --> 03:50.941
Had we taken the artefact,
there would have been no need to return.

03:50.951 --> 03:52.861
There were witnesses.

03:52.950 --> 03:54.860
What did these witnesses see?

03:54.951 --> 03:57.787
People taking the Touchstone
in the dead of night.

03:57.831 --> 04:01.449
They were dressed as you are
and carried weapons like yours.

04:02.349 --> 04:06.182
- Did they see where these people went?
- They left by your Stargate.

04:07.751 --> 04:11.002
As you know, none of our people
know how to use the portaI.

04:15.271 --> 04:17.346
Guards! Disarm the wrongdoers!

04:17.430 --> 04:19.553
Hold it!

04:24.271 --> 04:26.264
All right!

04:26.350 --> 04:28.343
We came here in peace,...

04:29.350 --> 04:32.553
...we expect to go in one... piece.

04:32.590 --> 04:34.665
Explain yourself. But be warned.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.954
If your answers are not satisfactory,...

04:37.988 --> 04:41.192
...then we have no choice
but to seek retribution.

04:41.228 --> 04:44.978
Taking revenge will not return
the Touchstone, for we did not take it.

04:44.990 --> 04:47.231
Then it will lead us to those that did.

04:47.310 --> 04:49.682
Only if they care what happens to us!

04:51.028 --> 04:54.612
Look, let me give you
a little life lesson about thieves.

04:54.629 --> 04:58.045
They're not really in touch
with their feminine side.

04:58.069 --> 05:00.310
Caring would be on a low priority...

05:00.949 --> 05:03.274
My uncle grows impatient.

05:04.589 --> 05:06.997
If the thieves used the gate to escape,...

05:07.069 --> 05:10.485
...the only hope to get it back
is to let us go back through the gate.

05:10.509 --> 05:12.216
And if they did come from Earth,...

05:12.309 --> 05:15.678
...our technology can help us
find out who the thieves were.

05:15.708 --> 05:20.120
How do we know that you will not
use the gate to escape responsibility?

05:20.108 --> 05:22.018
Trust us?

05:22.108 --> 05:24.434
<i>We are a simple people, Colonel.</i>

05:24.507 --> 05:27.711
We have no means to protect
ourselves from this disaster.

05:27.747 --> 05:32.992
If my uncle decides to trust you, our
entire future will depend on that decision.

05:34.627 --> 05:37.581
OK, that's a little pressure!
But we can handle that.

05:50.346 --> 05:52.091
Let them go.

06:01.026 --> 06:03.778
Please... help us.

07:16.785 --> 07:21.281
Why are you back so early? You were
supposed to study that weather device.

07:21.262 --> 07:23.255
We would do, if it were still there.

07:23.343 --> 07:24.754
What do you mean?

07:24.862 --> 07:27.865
We should talk in your office, sir.

07:29.942 --> 07:31.935
What's this about, Colonel?

07:36.983 --> 07:38.975
The Touchstone was stolen, sir.

07:39.062 --> 07:44.021
By people wearing SGC uniforms,
who came and went through the Stargate.

07:43.981 --> 07:46.687
What?! Well, who was it?

07:49.822 --> 07:52.908
Everyone involved here
would like to know that, sir.

07:55.062 --> 07:58.018
I don't appreciate
your implication, Colonel.

07:58.062 --> 08:02.108
Why would I send your team to study
the thing if I knew it wasn't there?

08:02.103 --> 08:04.096
No implication intended, sir.

08:04.983 --> 08:09.276
But circumstances do beg
the next logical question, which is...

08:09.261 --> 08:13.425
...could another SG team
have gone through without your order?

08:14.781 --> 08:16.774
Not without my knowing about it.

08:17.742 --> 08:19.735
Yes, sir.

08:21.701 --> 08:26.031
General, do you mind if I have Carter
recheck the dialling computer?

08:26.021 --> 08:31.444
Just to see if there are any signs of
anyone sneaking through the gate...

08:31.382 --> 08:33.208
...covertly.

08:34.259 --> 08:36.336
Behind your back, as it were, sir.

08:37.660 --> 08:41.873
Nothing happens regarding that Stargate
without my knowing about it.

08:41.860 --> 08:44.351
If a person sneezes near it, I get a report.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.652
I understand, sir.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.236
Colonel.

08:57.499 --> 09:00.120
Have Carter check it anyway.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.092
Thank you... very much, sir.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.177
<i>- Anything yet?
- Not on the Touchstone, sir.</i>

09:23.220 --> 09:25.296
Have you seen the Weather Channel?

09:25.378 --> 09:27.455
I'm more of a C-SPAN guy.

09:27.538 --> 09:29.912
Observe, O'Neill.

09:29.979 --> 09:34.143
<i>Chalk it up to a delayed
El NiÅ„o effect or just a run of bad luck,...</i>

09:34.139 --> 09:36.975
<i>.. but more storms
have stretched all over America,...</i>

09:37.019 --> 09:39.889
<i>.. even in Phoenix, Arizona,
causing widespread damage.</i>

09:39.938 --> 09:43.024
<i>Reports of injuries are still trickling in.</i>

09:43.058 --> 09:45.052
<i>We have flooding in Palm Springs...</i>

09:45.139 --> 09:47.346
<i>And that's not all.</i>

09:47.418 --> 09:50.918
There's record rainfall in Albuquerque,
hail in the Panhandle...

09:50.937 --> 09:52.931
...and three major rivers cresting.

09:53.018 --> 09:57.147
Something is definitely
altering this planet's weather.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.345
And you think it's this Touchstone?

10:00.738 --> 10:04.605
- Kind of a reach, isn't it?
- Not really, if you think about it.

10:04.618 --> 10:06.740
Whoever left that device on Madrona...

10:06.817 --> 10:09.571
...probably keyed it to
its atmospheric conditions.

10:09.619 --> 10:13.119
Somebody brings it back to Earth,
starts fiddling around with it...

10:13.136 --> 10:15.294
...and... who knows?!

10:15.376 --> 10:19.077
<i>- We don't know it's on Earth.
- I'm thinking it is.</i>

10:19.096 --> 10:21.884
There was a huge transitory glitch
three days ago,...

10:21.937 --> 10:23.811
...when SG-2 returned from a mission.

10:23.897 --> 10:26.186
The same hour
as the Touchstone was taken.

10:26.255 --> 10:29.128
SG-2's point of origin
was galaxies away from Madrona.

10:29.177 --> 10:32.048
Yeah, but this energy spike
is off the charts.

10:32.097 --> 10:36.427
Remember what happened the last time
the gate's power supply was overloaded?

10:36.415 --> 10:39.370
It jumped to the second gate
in the Antarctic.

10:39.417 --> 10:40.912
Thanks for the memory!

10:41.015 --> 10:45.513
Are you suggesting that SG-2 used
the second gate to steal the Touchstone?

10:45.495 --> 10:48.995
No. Not SG-2. Their mission
went as planned, through our gate.

10:49.015 --> 10:54.177
But someone might have used the second
gate a split second after SG-2 used ours...

10:54.135 --> 10:56.591
...to try to hide the energy spike in ours.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.692
Kind of like shooting off a gun
when a train's going by?

11:02.774 --> 11:05.349
To hide the sound.

11:05.416 --> 11:07.408
Yes, sir.

11:07.495 --> 11:11.541
If I'm right, SG-2's log should have
the same electronic signature...

11:11.534 --> 11:15.283
...as the last time the wormhole
jumped its tracks. Bear with me.

11:15.296 --> 11:16.919
Bearing.

11:20.095 --> 11:22.931
Damn! It should show up
on the primary meta-log.

11:22.975 --> 11:25.977
- Try the backup log.
- Yeah. Possibly.

11:32.495 --> 11:35.365
<i>If someone did try to erase
all the relevant data,...</i>

11:35.414 --> 11:37.573
...they could've easily missed a backup.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.610
Yes! There it is.

11:44.854 --> 11:48.982
<i>The second gate had to have been used.
The energy signature's identical.</i>

11:48.974 --> 11:53.850
Who was authorised to use it? I thought
it had been officially decommissioned.

11:53.812 --> 11:55.806
It was.

11:55.894 --> 11:58.100
Officially.

12:04.774 --> 12:06.767
<i>Come.</i>

12:10.094 --> 12:12.086
No. I need to talk to him now.

12:13.131 --> 12:15.754
Son, do you know
what colour this phone is?

12:17.092 --> 12:19.086
Yes. I'll hold.

12:19.451 --> 12:21.244
Carter find anything?

12:22.613 --> 12:25.864
Yes, sir. Apparently,
the second gate is being used.

12:25.894 --> 12:30.307
What?! I was given top-level assurances
that gate was to be sealed.

12:30.292 --> 12:34.504
A case of the left hand not knowing
what the right foot is doing, sir?

12:34.493 --> 12:36.650
That's what I'm trying to find out.

12:38.652 --> 12:40.644
No! It can't wait, son.

12:40.730 --> 12:44.315
Well, make sure he gets the message
the second he comes out.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.852
And, suddenly,
the President wasn't available!

12:50.890 --> 12:52.884
Every time I call, he's tied up.

12:52.971 --> 12:56.803
It's like someone is orchestrating
his schedule to keep us from speaking.

12:56.812 --> 12:58.804
Got a someone in mind, sir?

13:00.451 --> 13:02.908
This is gonna sound paranoid, Colonel.

13:02.971 --> 13:05.296
Back when the SG programme began,...

13:05.370 --> 13:08.573
...there was a philosophicaI skirmish
about its mandate.

13:08.610 --> 13:12.857
Some people wanted to make sure that
all discoveries were brought back,...

13:12.850 --> 13:16.634
...regardless of considerations
like interplanetary diplomacy.

13:18.649 --> 13:21.937
Do you mind if I ask
who these "some people" were?

13:21.971 --> 13:25.673
The truth is, I'm not sure
I ever fully knew who they were.

13:26.850 --> 13:30.849
I had a feeling that someone chose
not to surface during the debate.

13:30.850 --> 13:35.596
Not military - politicians
pulling strings behind the scenes.

13:36.289 --> 13:38.283
No one said so exactly.

13:38.370 --> 13:41.740
30 years in the service,
you develop an instinct about things.

13:42.809 --> 13:45.265
General, is your gut telling you...

13:45.330 --> 13:48.830
...that this "person" is responsible
for stealing the Touchstone?

13:48.850 --> 13:51.638
I'm a long way
from drawing that conclusion.

13:51.688 --> 13:56.980
But I'll be damned if I'll be blocked
by some sycophant in the White House.

13:56.928 --> 14:00.428
I have other channels I can pursue,
markers I can call in.

14:01.009 --> 14:02.503
General,...

14:02.609 --> 14:04.934
...I know I don't have to tell you this.

14:05.009 --> 14:07.548
But whoever these dark-side guys are,...

14:08.649 --> 14:13.192
...they can do some pretty nasty damage
if they figure out how to work this thing.

14:14.168 --> 14:18.001
I know, Colonel. I know.
Let me do some digging.

14:22.648 --> 14:26.599
In an effort to determine whether
the Touchstone was being used,...

14:26.607 --> 14:30.820
...I measured the Doppler shift for
gravitationaI and radiation emissions.

14:30.807 --> 14:35.102
I used one of my monitoring instruments,
and tied it in to two NOAA satellites.

14:35.087 --> 14:38.754
- What did you find?
- It's somewhere in the Nevada Desert.

14:38.768 --> 14:41.686
- From the crude triangulation...
- Nevada?

14:42.606 --> 14:44.647
Yes, sir. Something wrong?

14:45.967 --> 14:49.467
The second gate ended up
in Nevada, didn't it, sir? Nellis?

14:49.486 --> 14:50.731
Yes.

14:52.407 --> 14:56.869
<i>If the gate is there, it makes sense that
the Touchstone has at least been there.</i>

14:59.486 --> 15:01.480
You're going to love this, Colonel.

15:02.767 --> 15:05.222
Guess who just got reassigned to Nellis.

15:06.485 --> 15:08.063
Do tell.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.918
Colonel Maybourne.

15:10.966 --> 15:12.958
Oh, well, here's good news!

15:13.046 --> 15:17.293
Nellis is where we send the technology
we bring back through the gate?

15:17.287 --> 15:19.029
Yes. The Groom Lake facility.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.083
Area 51.

15:30.565 --> 15:33.769
- What are we looking at?
- We sent the MALP back to Madrona.

15:33.806 --> 15:37.674
It's basically a blizzard, sir -
winds gusting up to 80 miles an hour.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.687
Any more intense,
the whole planet's a write-off.

15:41.765 --> 15:44.173
How much time do they have remaining?

15:44.245 --> 15:48.623
If my extrapolations are correct,
we're looking at 48 to 72 hours...

15:48.605 --> 15:51.606
...before all the terraforming is kaput.

15:51.645 --> 15:57.566
- Permission to take a trip to Nevada, sir.
- OK. I'll call Nellis and get you cleared.

15:58.803 --> 16:00.797
Uh, General,...

16:01.764 --> 16:06.095
...it's become pretty obvious that
our own people are involved here.

16:06.083 --> 16:08.076
The government types, you know.

16:08.164 --> 16:10.205
How do you know who to trust?

16:10.284 --> 16:12.610
We have the necessary
clearance level, sir.

16:19.484 --> 16:23.434
Colonel, I need some documents
delivered to the Groom Lake facility.

16:25.724 --> 16:28.013
Are those documents sensitive enough...

16:28.082 --> 16:30.836
...to warrant a three-man team
with a Jaffa escort?

16:30.883 --> 16:32.294
Absolutely.

16:49.602 --> 16:53.186
Colonel O'Neill. Major Reynolds, NID.
Welcome to Area 51.

16:53.202 --> 16:57.746
Nice to meet you. This is Captain Carter,
Dr. Jackson and Teal'c.

16:57.722 --> 16:59.466
Gentlemen. Ma'am.

16:59.562 --> 17:03.346
I can't tell you what an honour it is
to meet you. You guys are a legend.

17:04.162 --> 17:08.659
Yeah, well... Thanks. We're hoping
to meet with Colonel Maybourne.

17:08.642 --> 17:11.726
He's been paged, sir.
Come inside - he'll find you there.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.671
<i>You obviously know who we are.</i>

17:13.761 --> 17:17.675
If it wasn't for you and the other
SG teams, we'd be out of business here.

17:17.681 --> 17:20.007
Follow me, please.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.324
<i>To your left is Medical Research.</i>

17:22.402 --> 17:27.065
They're focusing on the potential cure
for Alzheimer's that SG-5 brought back.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.910
The other side is Geology,
Space Metallurgy, and Artefacts Study,...

17:30.923 --> 17:35.134
...where they're poring over your notes
on that Heliopolis place, Dr. Jackson.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.955
"Meaning of life stuff" - I love that!

17:38.000 --> 17:42.544
<i>Dr Dobson to room 483.
Dr. Dobson.</i>

18:04.079 --> 18:08.873
Those are the two Goa'uld death gliders
you were in after you did your hero thing.

18:08.839 --> 18:11.212
Nice work, by the way.

18:11.279 --> 18:12.857
Yeah. Thanks.

18:15.359 --> 18:17.768
This way.

18:25.919 --> 18:27.912
This is the Bio-research Lab.

18:32.039 --> 18:34.614
Is this where you keep
the little green men?

18:36.440 --> 18:38.765
There are no alien life forms at Area 51.

18:42.719 --> 18:44.842
Present company excluded, of course.

18:49.038 --> 18:50.449
Colonel O'Neill.

18:50.557 --> 18:52.682
Hello, Maybourne.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.951
Major, if you'll excuse us.

18:59.358 --> 19:02.277
Teal'c! It's good to see you're well.

19:05.958 --> 19:10.171
In my culture, I would be well within
my rights to dismember you.

19:17.916 --> 19:21.038
Well... that's interesting.

19:22.637 --> 19:24.547
Is there something I can do for you?

19:24.637 --> 19:27.638
Yeah. We assume
the Touchstone was brought here.

19:27.678 --> 19:29.470
Excuse me?

19:29.557 --> 19:31.964
Maybe you have a different name for it?

19:32.037 --> 19:36.083
The weather controller
from Madrona - PX7-941?

19:36.076 --> 19:39.612
It seems that someone has sent you
on a fool's errand, Colonel.

19:39.635 --> 19:42.306
There is nothing
even remotely like that here.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.811
You are, however, aware of our mission?

19:45.836 --> 19:47.828
I remember a reference to it.

19:48.635 --> 19:52.765
But - correct me if I'm wrong -
nothing came back from that survey.

19:52.757 --> 19:56.375
- Not by our team.
- Another SGC team?

19:56.395 --> 19:57.973
You tell me.

19:59.234 --> 20:04.028
If you're looking for specific answers,
be less cryptic with your questions.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.031
Fine. Where's the damn Touchstone?

20:08.316 --> 20:10.807
Has the second Stargate been activated?

20:10.875 --> 20:13.913
It's been under complete lockdown
since its arrival here.

20:13.955 --> 20:15.949
It hasn't even been powered up.

20:16.796 --> 20:18.455
Mind if we have a look?

20:18.556 --> 20:21.510
I guarantee it's been dormant
since you came through it.

20:21.556 --> 20:25.340
Then there's no harm
in taking a look. Is there?

20:49.713 --> 20:52.750
There it is. Happy now, Colonel?

20:52.792 --> 20:54.786
<i>Carter.</i>

21:24.314 --> 21:27.433
- Satisfied?
- Not really.

21:28.711 --> 21:32.330
Just proves it got packed up
real nice after it was used.

21:32.353 --> 21:36.184
That gate has been in there since
it was brought here from the Antarctic.

21:37.272 --> 21:39.479
Come on, Harry!

21:39.551 --> 21:42.554
You and I have been through
this dance before.

21:42.592 --> 21:43.968
Uh,...

21:44.070 --> 21:46.064
...Colonel.

21:46.152 --> 21:48.192
This gate is plastic.

21:48.271 --> 21:50.145
What?!

21:51.592 --> 21:53.585
Captain Carter is correct.

21:53.671 --> 21:55.462
That's ridiculous!

22:06.630 --> 22:09.916
That's the gate that was
brought back from the Antarctic.

22:09.951 --> 22:12.703
It's been under lock and key
since it got here.

22:14.711 --> 22:17.878
This gate's plastic. Where's the real one?

22:26.950 --> 22:30.734
So... what the hell
happened to the Stargate?

22:30.750 --> 22:32.161
It's obviously been moved.

22:32.269 --> 22:34.595
So it can be fired up
without raising eyebrows?

22:34.669 --> 22:36.294
That's highly speculative.

22:39.749 --> 22:43.333
I don't know who's
giving you orders, Maybourne,...

22:43.351 --> 22:47.266
<i>.. but they had better come from
where the air is real thin.</i>

22:49.349 --> 22:51.259
Is that a threat, Colonel?

22:51.348 --> 22:54.469
You tell me the punishment
for losing a Stargate.

22:56.429 --> 23:00.676
That presumes there was
no authorisation to move the Stargate.

23:02.068 --> 23:05.153
- So who authorised it?
- That's classified.

23:05.189 --> 23:09.138
- We have the highest clearance.
- Within the military, you do.

23:15.709 --> 23:17.701
Are you telling me...

23:17.788 --> 23:19.945
...this is a civilian operation?!

23:23.669 --> 23:27.085
Colonel O'Neill and his people
need an escort back to their vehicle.

23:27.107 --> 23:32.529
- Who's pulling the strings, Maybourne?
- Take a piece of advice, Jack. Let it drop.

23:32.468 --> 23:34.461
Drop it?!

23:35.427 --> 23:39.593
Please... don't make these gentlemen
have to get disrespectfuI.

24:12.506 --> 24:15.211
We're operating under a virtual blackout.

24:15.267 --> 24:17.425
No one will confirm or deny a thing.

24:17.507 --> 24:22.798
The only other Stargate on the planet gets
spirited away, and it's business as usual?!

24:22.747 --> 24:27.125
Not really. Somebody's clamped down
on the communications channels.

24:27.106 --> 24:30.025
- What of the Touchstone?
- Sometime while we were gone,...

24:30.066 --> 24:32.189
...my instrument readings dropped to zero.

24:32.266 --> 24:35.183
They've stopped using it,
or are shielding it from detection.

24:35.226 --> 24:37.847
<i>The weather anomalies
have abated on Earth.</i>

24:37.905 --> 24:42.615
They probably realised experimenting
with it was causing too many problems.

24:42.586 --> 24:44.413
Exactly.

24:44.506 --> 24:48.968
If we can't track the Touchstone, we may
be able to track the second gate on Earth.

24:48.945 --> 24:54.072
Oh, sure! Let's just put out an APB for
a huge, honkin', two-storey metal ring...

24:54.025 --> 24:57.691
...with 39 little pictures
all nicely engraved on it!

24:57.704 --> 25:00.374
Actually, I had another thought.

25:00.424 --> 25:02.833
Go ahead, Captain.

25:02.904 --> 25:04.695
We use our gate to go to Madrona,...

25:04.785 --> 25:08.154
...then do a 180 and return
through the second gate here on Earth.

25:08.184 --> 25:11.970
If one input the Earth's coordinates
on the Madrona dialling device,...

25:11.983 --> 25:14.605
...he would be sent back
to the gate on this facility.

25:14.663 --> 25:18.615
You would. Unless you intentionally
overpower the gate.

25:18.624 --> 25:22.457
The way the wormhole arced
to send the two of you to the other gate.

25:22.463 --> 25:27.126
As you may recall, it was a minor miracle
that either of you survived that incident.

25:27.104 --> 25:29.346
What if we used the MALP robot?

25:29.423 --> 25:34.217
Perfect. The GPS could give us an exact
position once the MALP made it through.

25:34.183 --> 25:37.102
Someone would have to
accompany you to Madrona,...

25:37.144 --> 25:39.136
...to dial the correct address.

25:39.223 --> 25:43.138
- Uh... I would be that person.
- I'll go, too.

25:43.143 --> 25:46.595
Bring the necessary equipment
to modulate the power to the gate.

25:47.103 --> 25:48.681
Let's do it!

26:05.784 --> 26:08.489
They've arrived
through the Madrona gate, sir.

26:08.541 --> 26:11.211
We're transporting our people
across the galaxy...

26:11.262 --> 26:13.719
...to find something
we lost in our own back yard!

26:13.782 --> 26:16.239
Incredible!

26:26.701 --> 26:28.694
They're back, Uncle Roham!

26:30.382 --> 26:34.878
- Did you bring the Touchstone?
- Not yet. We're working on it.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.854
Don't you understand?!

26:36.942 --> 26:40.310
Look around you!
The rivers have turned to ice!

26:40.340 --> 26:43.758
Before long, all our croplands
will be decimated!

26:43.781 --> 26:45.359
Why did you return?

26:45.461 --> 26:49.625
We have to set this machine from here
to track the Touchstone.

26:49.622 --> 26:52.457
- You're lying!
- We're not lying!

26:52.500 --> 26:54.459
We really are trying to help.

26:54.541 --> 26:56.535
Come now!

27:29.179 --> 27:31.551
They should be inputting the last address.

27:58.018 --> 28:00.557
Status, Captain?

28:00.618 --> 28:04.070
- It's through, sir. It's on Earth.
- Where the hell is it?

28:04.097 --> 28:06.554
I'm switching over to
terrestriaI video signal.

28:06.617 --> 28:10.486
<i>- We have visual, but it's dark.
- Can you make out anything?</i>

28:10.498 --> 28:12.953
No, not much.

28:16.457 --> 28:19.244
- There's somebody moving.
- What is its location?

28:19.297 --> 28:22.962
I'm resetting the MALP global
positioning system to Telsat 13,...

28:22.978 --> 28:25.220
...attempting to triangulate.

28:31.257 --> 28:35.173
- What the hell happened?!
- They blew it away, sir.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.049
<i>Carter?</i>

28:47.136 --> 28:49.509
The link is gone.
They destroyed the MALP.

28:49.576 --> 28:53.656
- Did you get the coordinates?
- No time. But I've got it narrowed down.

28:53.656 --> 28:55.317
How far down?

28:56.297 --> 28:59.797
Well, as far as I can tell,
it's in Southern Utah.

29:00.855 --> 29:03.347
Oh! Well... Southern Utah!

29:03.415 --> 29:05.492
Well, at least that's a start.

29:05.575 --> 29:08.991
I have one last marker to call.
Let me see what I can find out.

29:17.415 --> 29:19.575
- Hello, General.
- Whitlow.

29:19.655 --> 29:21.648
<i>Shall we walk?</i>

29:21.736 --> 29:26.445
As I told you on the phone, I don't have
time for all this cloak-and-dagger stuff.

29:26.414 --> 29:28.740
- I need to know...
- Please... walk.

29:28.815 --> 29:31.388
It makes it harder for the parabolics.

29:33.095 --> 29:36.677
<i>Glad to see the paranoia
quotient is as high as ever!</i>

29:36.694 --> 29:40.194
You never know who's listening.
What do you need to know?

29:40.214 --> 29:44.380
Two things. Who's got the Stargate?
Who's got the weather device?

29:44.375 --> 29:49.334
- I wish I had that info.
- I don't have time for games, Whitlow.

29:49.295 --> 29:53.423
As much as I'd love to clear
our little IOU, I don't know anything.

29:53.413 --> 29:57.493
I don't even know what you're talking
about with regards to a weather device.

29:57.493 --> 29:59.782
But are you saying
the Stargate is missing?!

29:59.854 --> 30:03.721
- The second one is, yes.
- That doesn't sound like a good thing!

30:03.732 --> 30:06.688
Come on! You've got
your fingers in every agency.

30:06.733 --> 30:10.779
You haven't heard anything?
Military intelligence? NSA? CIA?

30:10.773 --> 30:14.643
If it were military, I'd know about it.
It's got to be civilian.

30:14.653 --> 30:16.942
Anything strange going on at Nellis?

30:17.012 --> 30:21.391
There's always something going on
at Nellis, and most of the time it's strange.

30:21.373 --> 30:24.825
But nothing about a Stargate
or a... weather... thingy.

30:24.854 --> 30:28.519
Does this have something to do
with all the weird weather lately?

30:29.972 --> 30:32.927
How about Southern Utah?
Anything going on there?

30:32.972 --> 30:34.965
Southern Utah?!

30:36.252 --> 30:38.246
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

30:38.332 --> 30:40.538
A requisition just crossed my desk...

30:40.613 --> 30:45.572
...requesting a C-5 for a classified pick-up
at an NID landing site. It's in Utah.

30:45.532 --> 30:47.740
Hm. No idea what it's for?

30:48.491 --> 30:52.490
<i>Not officially. But I don't have to
tell you, a C-5's a big airplane.</i>

30:52.491 --> 30:56.573
Big enough to hold a Stargate and
transport it anywhere in the world.

30:56.572 --> 30:58.565
Where's the strip?

31:00.132 --> 31:03.916
Just south of the Black Mountains.
About 40 clicks west of Parowan.

31:05.770 --> 31:07.763
Thank you, Whitlow.

31:07.851 --> 31:09.476
George?

31:12.171 --> 31:13.998
Does this mean we're even?

31:15.010 --> 31:17.501
If it pans out, it does.

31:21.491 --> 31:23.484
OK, here's the deal.

31:23.571 --> 31:26.656
This NID landing strip
doesn't officially exist,...

31:26.691 --> 31:29.644
...so I don't think
there's a jurisdictionaI issue.

31:29.691 --> 31:34.400
<i>But even if there is, that C-5 is Air Force
property, and it is our jurisdiction.</i>

31:34.369 --> 31:37.076
- Can we go now, sir?
- There's a chopper waiting.

31:37.131 --> 31:40.914
It will take you to Hill Air Force Base.
Then you're on your own.

31:40.931 --> 31:42.306
Thank you.

31:42.410 --> 31:44.403
One other thing, Colonel.

31:44.490 --> 31:49.034
We don't know if the people who took
the gate and Touchstone are friend or foe.

31:49.009 --> 31:53.340
Therefore, under no conditions
are you to fire on them. Understood?

31:57.528 --> 31:59.984
Under no conditions... fire.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.294
That's right.

32:03.529 --> 32:05.737
<i>What if they fire on us, sir?</i>

32:05.808 --> 32:11.230
<i>Then you're to take cover. Do not return
fire unless it's the only option remaining...</i>

32:11.170 --> 32:13.709
- ...to defend yourselves.
- I don't think...

32:13.769 --> 32:17.768
Those are my orders, Colonel. We're
already going way out on a limb on this.

32:17.768 --> 32:21.767
I don't want you killing another American
who may just be following orders.

32:21.769 --> 32:24.888
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

34:37.844 --> 34:39.717
Stand to, gentlemen!

34:42.043 --> 34:44.914
Keep those hands visible.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.407
Who the hell are you?!

34:48.483 --> 34:51.983
No one's damn business!
Step away from the crate.

35:32.202 --> 35:33.661
Stop!

35:46.280 --> 35:47.610
Don't do it!

35:53.920 --> 35:55.036
Agh!

35:55.161 --> 35:56.704
What?

35:59.000 --> 36:00.992
I missed the address.

36:10.081 --> 36:12.074
At least we have this.

36:33.318 --> 36:36.320
They've come back, Uncle Roham!
Just as I told you!

36:36.360 --> 36:39.445
- Do they have the Touchstone?
- They do!

38:06.315 --> 38:10.811
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

38:12.077 --> 38:14.782
We hope your faith and trust in us
has been restored.

38:14.835 --> 38:19.831
You have lived up to your promises.
Let there be peace between our worlds.

38:19.795 --> 38:21.704
We must remain vigilant,...

38:21.797 --> 38:24.632
...lest those that trespassed before
come back...

38:24.675 --> 38:27.463
...to violate the sanctity
of the Holy Touchstone.

38:27.514 --> 38:31.014
Just make sure your guards
are paying attention this time!

38:32.635 --> 38:35.304
Blessings be upon you.

39:16.152 --> 39:19.403
<i>Everything should be back to normal
soon, here and on Madrona.</i>

39:19.432 --> 39:23.052
We think they'll let us return
to do the studies we'd hoped to do.

39:23.074 --> 39:27.403
- Any idea what happened, sir?
- It's still something of a shell game.

39:27.393 --> 39:30.429
- The investigation was taken from me.
- By whom?

39:30.472 --> 39:33.047
I'm still trying to find that out.

39:33.114 --> 39:36.400
So we may never know who those men
were who went through the gate.

39:36.432 --> 39:38.592
Not unless you can tell me
where they went.

39:40.353 --> 39:43.271
Until then, all SG units
are to be on watch...

39:43.311 --> 39:46.313
...for four NID guys
wandering around another planet.

39:46.353 --> 39:50.101
Great! So all this
could happen again, huh?

39:50.112 --> 39:52.105
No, Colonel!

39:52.192 --> 39:56.820
This time, I was able to ensure that
our Stargate will be the only one in use.

39:56.793 --> 40:00.411
Sir... The second Stargate
is being retired?

40:00.431 --> 40:04.476
Yes. Only this time, there will be
a permanent iris welded over it,...

40:04.471 --> 40:07.722
...and it will be placed under
round-the-clock guard...

40:07.751 --> 40:10.206
...under the command of the SGC -
my command.

40:10.271 --> 40:12.844
No lying and deceit, smoke and mirrors?

40:12.911 --> 40:18.452
You'll be there yourselves - all of you will
- When we put it away for good.

40:48.110 --> 40:50.233
This put you out of a job, Maybourne?

40:51.070 --> 40:55.150
Oh, you'd be surprised. Strange things
happen in high places, Colonel.

40:55.150 --> 40:56.940
Don't I know it!

40:57.030 --> 40:59.652
People get reassigned. So does property.

40:59.710 --> 41:02.711
Artefacts get misplaced. Orders change.

41:02.750 --> 41:04.742
Every day's a new day.
