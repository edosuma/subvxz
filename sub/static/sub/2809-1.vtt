Not going to shake your hand.

11:45.404 --> 11:46.838
Good to see you, man.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.440
And it's so nice
to finally meet you.

11:48.442 --> 11:51.409
Oh, um, we've met.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.111
At Stanford.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.114
You guy remember. She was
Laura's freshman year roommate.

11:57.183 --> 11:58.383
Oh!
Oh.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.784
That Becky.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.953
You hated me, so it's okay.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.188
No, no.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.322
It's okay.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.757
I liked to study all the time

12:05.759 --> 12:06.958
and go to bed early.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.727
I think it was
the Christian rock...

12:08.729 --> 12:10.495
that made Laura hate you.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.797
We never hated you.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.466
What a relief.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.234
Who's this little munchkin?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.368
Say hi, Hannah-bear.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.770
Hello.

12:18.772 --> 12:22.774
Hannah, somebody wants
to meet you.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.145
(Gasping)

12:27.147 --> 12:30.882
He can't breathe.
He's going to die.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.917
Oh...
No, no, no, no, no.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.520
It's okay.
It's a space bag.

12:35.522 --> 12:39.057
It compresses objects
for easy storage.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.959
Mr. Bear, um,
is sleeping,

12:40.961 --> 12:42.927
and he just needs us
to wake him up.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.329
NICK:
Yeah!

12:44.331 --> 12:46.197
(Air hissing) Oh!

12:46.199 --> 12:48.299
Oh! Oh! Hey!

12:49.268 --> 12:51.035
Wow, he needs a hug.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.973
Yeah.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.841
NICK: Jesus.
BECKY: Sounds selfish to me.

12:56.843 --> 12:59.177
JAMES:
Everyone is selfish.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.179
You don't believe in friendship?
That's not what I'm saying.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.181
I'm saying the more
self-sufficient you are,

13:03.183 --> 13:05.950
the more free you are, okay?

13:05.952 --> 13:07.519
Every connection is an
opportunity for compromise.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.188
It's basically death
by a thousand small cuts.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.856
But that's why God put us here.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.291
To make compromises?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.093
To give of ourselves. To make
the world a better place.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.095
You want to make the world
a better place?

13:17.097 --> 13:18.863
Make your world a better place.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.865
LILY:
Hey, if you hate people so much

13:20.867 --> 13:22.367
how come you asked me
to make one?

13:22.369 --> 13:25.003
I don't hate people. You clearly
aren't listening to me.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.971
NICK:
I think we understand you
perfectly.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.007
Everything's easier
if you get to call the shots.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.076
All right.
Let's talk about it.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.813
We obviously have a lot
of bad blood between us.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.881
Yeah, well, maybe we have
some bad blood

13:36.883 --> 13:39.150
but, you know,
it's not like AIDS blood.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.285
Lily.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.287
Or hepatitis blood.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.453
Malaria.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.355
Ebola.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.457
Shit, Nicky. That is some
seriously bad blood.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.592
(Laughing)

13:47.594 --> 13:49.027
All right, Nicky, you win.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.895
Ebola blood is the worst blood.

13:50.897 --> 13:54.132
All I'm trying to say is that
things would have been better

13:54.134 --> 13:56.335
if Lily and I were able
to convince you outside of court

13:56.336 --> 13:59.270
not to take the company
in the direction you wanted.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.975
Is that a James apology?

14:03.977 --> 14:05.577
(Mumbling) (Laughing)

14:05.579 --> 14:08.446
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
What's a James apology?

14:08.448 --> 14:10.348
Come on, dude.
JAMES:
What is it?

14:10.350 --> 14:13.351
Come on. Have you ever said
"I'm sorry" in your entire life?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.485
JAMES:
Of course.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.920
(Snickering)

14:15.922 --> 14:17.622
I'm sorry you feel that way.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.991
(Laughing)

14:23.929 --> 14:25.630
No, honey.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.131
Look, you know what?

14:27.133 --> 14:29.434
I hear what
you're trying to say,

14:29.436 --> 14:31.336
and I appreciate it.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.338
Thank you.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.308
You know what we need to do?

14:37.310 --> 14:38.910
We need to get smoked-up

14:38.912 --> 14:41.479
and go skinny-dipping
in the hot tub.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.348
Becky, what do you say?

14:43.350 --> 14:45.483
I... I don't know.
I'm tired.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.951
Nicky?

14:46.953 --> 14:48.453
Awkward.
Yeah.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.421
All right, well,

14:50.423 --> 14:55.426
anybody who isn't totally lame
can join me.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.330
(Clearing throat)

15:03.569 --> 15:05.336
What?

15:11.210 --> 15:13.411
They seem so unhappy,
don't they?

15:13.413 --> 15:17.048
I'd be unhappy too
if I were married to him.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.517
Do you want an Ambien?

15:19.519 --> 15:21.286
NICK:
Mmm.

15:22.915 --> 15:24.355
BECKY:
Whatever happened to that guy?

15:24.357 --> 15:25.490
Is he still in jail?

15:25.492 --> 15:27.091
NICK:
Benji? No.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.993
He got out a few years ago.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.495
James and Lily
let him crash here

15:30.497 --> 15:31.930
so he could get back
on his feet.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.231
He lives here?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.133
They let him rent
the guest house

15:35.135 --> 15:36.534
down at the edge
of the property.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.137
God, I'm going to have
to see him too this weekend?

15:39.139 --> 15:41.606
No, no, he travels a lot.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.441
Giving lectures.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.010
I didn't know
you were still in touch.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.679
I see Facebook updates.

15:47.681 --> 15:50.081
It's shitty, isn't it?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.482
Seems like I let everybody go.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.251
BECKY:
Well, I'm glad we're here

15:53.253 --> 15:54.619
so you can finally
get some closure,

15:54.621 --> 15:56.587
but that doesn't mean
you have to keep these people

15:56.589 --> 15:58.323
in your life.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.091
This is your past.

16:00.093 --> 16:03.528
Your present is so much better.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.173
How was it?

16:15.175 --> 16:19.210
It was the relaxation experience
of a lifetime.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.411
Hmm.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.047
And I saw a UFO.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.049
A UFO, huh?

16:25.051 --> 16:26.351
You must be stoked.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.486
Came down really, really close.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.190
And this staircase of white
shot down.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.292
Like a soft rock escalator.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.195
Exactly like a soft rock
escalator.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.698
And then Jon Secada appeared,

16:40.700 --> 16:44.435
and he descended
into the hot tub.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.237
Also naked?
No.

16:47.072 --> 16:50.341
He wore a majestic thong.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.344
And a cape.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.013
And...

16:56.715 --> 16:58.750
jelly bracelets.

16:58.752 --> 17:02.153
Sounds like I should have come.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.097
They brought their own pillows.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.432
(Laughing)

17:14.434 --> 17:16.367
Who does that?

17:19.505 --> 17:27.505
♪

18:15.294 --> 18:18.429
So when you get 10 stars
you get to have a party.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.164
What kind of party?

18:20.166 --> 18:22.133
A unicorn party.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.269
Well, I love unicorn parties.
Can I come?

18:25.271 --> 18:28.439
Uh, you have to be cool.

18:28.441 --> 18:32.643
Hey, Nicky. You want to go see
the greenhouse?

18:37.449 --> 18:39.383
NICK: Oh, my God.
BECKY: If we don't act fast,

18:39.385 --> 18:42.320
James will make us go antiquing.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.622
We have to take our destiny
into our own hands

18:44.624 --> 18:46.324
before it's too late.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.795
(Indistinct chattering)

18:50.797 --> 18:52.630
(Gasping) Oh!

18:52.632 --> 18:56.234
BOTH:
You may not want to,
but you must!

18:57.202 --> 18:58.870
(Lily laughing) No.

18:58.872 --> 19:00.705
(Laughing):
Yes.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.340
Do it, dude. Do it.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.608
JAMES:
You must.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.243
Hey!

19:05.245 --> 19:07.612
This is that game,
Cosmic Wimpout.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.515
Remember me telling you
how awesome it is?

19:10.517 --> 19:13.885
I want to get you stoned
and feed you pancakes.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.419
(Laughing)

19:17.356 --> 19:18.489
What's your Wi-Fi
password?

19:18.491 --> 19:20.424
"dividebyzero".
One word, no caps.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.662
But the Internet's been down
since yesterday.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.165
Roll, roll.
JAMES:
Yeah, yeah.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.367
I'm going to go again.
Are you ready?

19:29.369 --> 19:31.169
All right, here we go.

19:31.803 --> 19:33.204
Dice out of control.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.239
No. Fringe benefits.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.641
Fine, then reroll clause.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.242
NICK:
You didn't clear moons, dude.

19:38.244 --> 19:39.544
JAMES:
Yeah, I totally did.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.912
No, you didn't.

19:40.914 --> 19:43.481
Nick, the rules are the rules.
You didn't clear moons.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.916
Reroll.
NICK:
Reroll.

19:44.918 --> 19:46.951
It's time for the daily bubble.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.953
Not now, honey.
Daddy's in the middle

19:48.955 --> 19:50.421
of a Cuban crime wave.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.291
It's time for
the daily bubble now!

19:54.927 --> 19:56.661
NICK:
Okay...

19:56.663 --> 19:58.596
(Indistinct chattering)

19:58.598 --> 20:00.398
JAMES:
Every day we make a bubble

20:00.400 --> 20:02.867
and see if we can beat our
record for how long it lasts

20:02.869 --> 20:04.502
before it pops.

20:04.504 --> 20:08.773
Whoa, that's a really
big bubble.

20:08.775 --> 20:12.510
ALL:
One, two, three,

20:12.512 --> 20:14.812
four, five,

20:14.814 --> 20:16.514
six...

20:17.749 --> 20:19.317
That's a record.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.219
Twelve seconds.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.889
That wasn't a very good
bubble, huh?

20:24.891 --> 20:27.625
HANNAH:
Uncle Benji!

20:38.237 --> 20:39.904
(Sighing)

20:39.906 --> 20:42.873
BENJI:
Hey, little lady.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.242
I just had a really long ride.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.443
JAMES:
Where are you coming from?

20:45.445 --> 20:47.445
Just came from L.A.
this morning.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.680
That's Ariel.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.449
Your house is nasty.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.285
Nasty's the new dope.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.455
NICK:
Hey. Weird to see you here.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.325
Long time, buddy.

21:01.327 --> 21:02.827
Wow. Are you stoned?

21:02.829 --> 21:03.995
(Laughing)

21:03.997 --> 21:05.997
There have been
serious improvements

21:05.999 --> 21:07.465
in pot since college.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.367
You guys have pot?
So much!

21:09.369 --> 21:11.402
Nick, discretion, please.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.839
Hey. Who's this?

21:14.841 --> 21:16.374
We've met.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.611
Right. Yeah. You're...

21:20.613 --> 21:24.015
You used to hump
my stuffed animals.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.449
(All giggling)

21:25.451 --> 21:27.952
Laura's roommate.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.021
Yeah.

21:30.023 --> 21:32.423
Oh, you guys haven't heard.

21:33.759 --> 21:35.826
World's ending.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.496
I'm going to take a nap.

21:39.731 --> 21:41.565
(Sighing)

21:44.356 --> 21:45.636
(People shouting over recording)

21:45.638 --> 21:47.505
ARIEL:
<i>Benji, check this out.</i>

21:47.507 --> 21:49.907
<i>Holy shit. It's crazy.</i>

21:49.909 --> 21:51.609
BENJI:
<i>We should get the fuck</i>
<i>out of here now.</i>

21:51.611 --> 21:53.311
WOMAN:
<i>Burn it down!</i>

21:53.313 --> 21:54.979
MAN:
<i>Back up, back up, back up.</i>

21:54.981 --> 21:57.315
BENJI:
<i>Come on, we don't want to get</i>
<i>stuck in L.A.</i>

21:57.317 --> 21:58.749
This is unbelievable.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.353
All this for a power outage.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.522
No. It's got to be some sort
of coordinated attack.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.590
You should show them Berkeley.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.394
I thought we could
at least sleep there,

22:10.396 --> 22:11.729
but it was way worse
than L.A.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.097
BENJI:
<i>Fuck. They're breaking in.</i>

22:13.099 --> 22:14.999
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

22:15.001 --> 22:16.834
ARIEL:
<i>Just a second.</i>
<i>I want to shoot...</i>

22:16.836 --> 22:18.936
<i>(Gunshot)</i>
BENJI:
<i>Are you fucking serious?</i>

22:18.938 --> 22:20.838
What's wrong with these people?

22:20.840 --> 22:24.742
They're scared and reacting
to a militarized police force.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.544
Or maybe they're just selfish,
lazy products

22:26.546 --> 22:27.878
of an entitlement society?

22:27.880 --> 22:31.549
Nick, your wife's a Republican.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.718
Mm-mm. Libertarian.
Okay, so you believe

22:33.720 --> 22:35.486

planting bombs in semi trucks,

35:19.518 --> 35:21.585
I thought your place was huge.

35:21.587 --> 35:26.156
We spend all our time
decorating and redecorating.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.225
I don't even use
90% of the rooms.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.328
You still haven't
figured it out.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.231
What?

35:34.233 --> 35:36.133
What you want out of life.

35:36.901 --> 35:38.802
You still having
those panic attacks?

35:38.804 --> 35:40.337
Haven't had one in years.

35:41.906 --> 35:43.607
That's good.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.409
Till two days ago.

35:47.378 --> 35:48.578
Really?

35:52.216 --> 35:53.850
It's really weird
coming up here.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.485
It's like going back in time.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.454
I just keep thinking
about everything.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.823
And it's really strange
seeing Lily again.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.159
Come on. Wake up.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.426
What are you doing?

36:03.428 --> 36:06.196
I am trying to wake you
the fuck up.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.397
Stop hitting me.
No.

36:07.399 --> 36:10.300
You need to make decisions,
take action,

36:10.302 --> 36:12.235
live with the consequences...
Okay! Stop hitting me!

36:12.237 --> 36:15.172
All right. All right.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.607
Yes.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.443
Maybe. Yes!

36:21.312 --> 36:25.515
ALL:
One, two, three.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.384
Another one.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.653
Only one a day,
or it's not special.

36:29.655 --> 36:33.390
Let's go look for fairies
in the forest.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.592
Fairies?
Yeah, I saw one this morning.

36:35.594 --> 36:38.628
Maybe if we're lucky
we'll find her.

36:40.231 --> 36:41.932
Stay within view of the house.

36:41.934 --> 36:43.466
No problem.

36:47.905 --> 36:51.408
Lev, buddy, are you a terrorist?

36:54.979 --> 36:56.713
I don't think so.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.785
Cool.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.554
Cool.

37:06.824 --> 37:09.626
LILY:
You can't go commando
if you're borrowing my pants.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.994
There has to be some kind
of barrier.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.562
I do not share underwear.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.297
What?
They're perfectly washed.

37:14.299 --> 37:16.233
Yes, but the memories remain.

37:17.401 --> 37:19.603
Laura, can I talk to you
for a second?

37:19.605 --> 37:21.238
Hey, do-not-disturb
zone, James.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.006
Please.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.307
She's my friend.

37:24.309 --> 37:26.243
He said please.
Ugh.

37:30.848 --> 37:32.015
JAMES:
If we ration this

37:32.017 --> 37:33.617
it should last quite a while.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.552
We're in the middle
of a growing season,

37:35.554 --> 37:37.821
so we should have plenty
of fresh vegetables.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.523
But I think we should only eat
half of what we grow,

37:40.525 --> 37:42.726
and then preserve the rest.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.728
Oh, what's that?

37:44.730 --> 37:46.463
EpiPens, amoxicillin,

37:46.465 --> 37:47.831
tetracycline, erythromycin.

37:47.833 --> 37:50.867
Jesus, I had no idea
you were such a survivalist.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.002
I buy in bulk.

37:52.004 --> 37:53.470
I think the medical fridge

37:53.472 --> 37:55.605
is kind of crossing
the prepper line.

37:55.607 --> 37:56.873
I started an emergency
checklist,

37:56.875 --> 37:58.041
if you want to go over it
with me.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.476
Okay, you are aware of the fact

37:59.478 --> 38:01.578
that I'm drunk right now, right?

38:01.580 --> 38:02.846
Yeah.

38:02.848 --> 38:05.348
We can do this later.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.350
By the way, I asked Lev
if he's a terrorist.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.885
What?
We're in the clear.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.820
What do you mean you asked him?

38:10.822 --> 38:13.990
I caught him off guard and
carefully gauged his reaction.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.992
James, you're a fucking idiot.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.360
Hey.

38:17.362 --> 38:18.595
Okay, all right.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.397
Uh, we're going to go back
in there,

38:20.399 --> 38:21.998
and you are going to ask me
the exact same thing

38:22.000 --> 38:23.333
in front of him.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.501
Laura, trust me.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.969
You don't have to worry
about Lev.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.470
Either we're going
to do this my way

38:27.472 --> 38:29.472
or I am calling the authorities.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.041
With what?
Your Bat Phone?

38:31.043 --> 38:32.609
Don't test me.

38:34.879 --> 38:36.046
(Laughing and chattering)

38:36.048 --> 38:38.315
NICK: That was good.
JAMES: Laura.

38:38.317 --> 38:39.983
Now I'm kind of worked
a little bit.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.351
Laura.
Yes?

38:41.353 --> 38:42.686
Are you a terrorist?

38:44.889 --> 38:47.057
No. Can you pass
the rolls?

38:47.059 --> 38:50.927
Anyone here? Anyone engage any
illegal or treasonous activity?

38:50.929 --> 38:53.530
Dude, what the fuck
are you talking about?

38:53.532 --> 38:55.732
I have to ask.
It's for insurance.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.967
(Laughing)
NICK:
Anyway...

38:57.969 --> 38:59.803
Good. Could you pass
the wine?

38:59.805 --> 39:01.871
God, James,
you've become so paranoid.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.408
JAMES:
We found out today

39:05.410 --> 39:06.876
that the cops
got run out of town.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.745
What does that mean?

39:08.747 --> 39:10.647
It means that we should talk
about ways to secure the house.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.816
Oh, I can build
a security system.

39:12.818 --> 39:15.552
You guys got a baby monitor or
a cell phone or remote control?

39:15.554 --> 39:17.854
Mm-hmm.
Shouldn't be a problem then.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.956
We should also talk
about rationing.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.725
Yawn!

39:21.727 --> 39:23.960
He's kind of right, Lily.
LILY:
Come on, you guys.

39:23.962 --> 39:26.029
This is the first time
we've all been together in what?

39:26.031 --> 39:27.797
Like eight years?

39:27.799 --> 39:31.434
I propose we table all serious
apocalypse talk until tomorrow.

39:31.436 --> 39:32.702
All in favour?

39:32.704 --> 39:34.037
Aye.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.705
Anyone else?
All in favour?

39:35.707 --> 39:36.840
Aye.

39:36.842 --> 39:37.842
All opposed?

39:37.843 --> 39:38.843
Nay.
Nay.

39:38.844 --> 39:41.111
Lame. Lev?

39:41.113 --> 39:42.812
Nay.
(Scoffing)

39:42.814 --> 39:44.047
You're dead to me.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.949
Becky, what say you?

39:45.951 --> 39:47.417
Um, I don't care.

39:47.419 --> 39:49.519
That's an abstention.
Four to three.

39:49.521 --> 39:52.822
Victory. Mandatory libations
and celebration.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.891
ALL:
Cheers.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.394
LILY:
To democracy.
To democracy.

39:58.596 --> 40:00.597
All right, and onto the next
order of business,

40:00.599 --> 40:03.533
I propose that we all
go around the table

40:03.535 --> 40:05.602
and everybody say the one thing

40:05.604 --> 40:08.872
they will miss the most
about the old world.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.407
Benji, you start.

40:11.642 --> 40:13.143
Hmm.

40:13.145 --> 40:15.145
I don't know.

40:15.147 --> 40:16.646
I got nothing.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.014
Seriously?

40:18.016 --> 40:19.416
You're ruining the game
and we haven't even started.

40:19.418 --> 40:20.984
I know what Benji will miss.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.118
What?

40:22.120 --> 40:24.921
Starbucks.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.956
(Groaning)
LILY:
Oh, shit.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.725
Oh, fuck.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.026
Starbucks?

40:30.028 --> 40:31.494
Yes.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.730
I'm guilty of that.
What a hypocrite.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.565
(Lily laughing)

40:35.567 --> 40:38.134
Laura, what about you?

40:38.136 --> 40:40.770
I will miss history.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.605
(Snickering)

40:42.607 --> 40:45.008
What kind of bullshit answer
is that?

40:45.010 --> 40:46.743
Boring.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.645
All right. Every Fourth of July
I go to Mount Vernon

40:48.647 --> 40:49.946
to re-enact
the Revolutionary War.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.748
It is one of the highlights
of my year,

40:51.750 --> 40:53.850
and I'm allowed to miss it.
Don't judge me.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.453
What happens
at these re-enactments?

40:56.455 --> 40:58.154
Well, I play George Washington.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.789
(All laughing)

40:59.791 --> 41:02.091
You play an old,
dead white dude?

41:02.093 --> 41:03.693
Who led the American Revolution.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.195
No big deal.
Just the most coveted role,

41:05.197 --> 41:06.930
which I have won
five years running.

41:06.932 --> 41:08.097
Forensics? Hollah!

41:08.099 --> 41:09.232
NICK:
Oh! Ready?

41:09.234 --> 41:10.567
(Grunting)

41:10.569 --> 41:12.001
Rhetoric!
Rhetoric!

41:12.003 --> 41:13.236
One, two, three.

41:13.238 --> 41:14.771
BOTH:
We're a set. What?

41:14.773 --> 41:16.873
A set. What?
Count it out.

41:16.875 --> 41:17.841
One.
Two.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.242
BOTH:
Three. Mathletes.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.211
What?
(Laughing)

41:21.213 --> 41:24.247
You're still really,
really good at that.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.082
Okay, I'm going to miss YouTube,

41:26.084 --> 41:29.853
because now there's, like,
zero chance I'll ever be famous.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.054
That's probably a good thing.

41:31.056 --> 41:32.222
(Laughing)

41:32.224 --> 41:33.823
Well, I was planning
on getting famous

41:33.825 --> 41:36.259
for my talent, not for
fucking married senators.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.795
Whoo! Senator, singular.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.831
And I got 20 million hits,
so suck it.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.166
Literally.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.668
LILY: Jesus.
Whoa.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.704
I'm really going to miss NASA.

41:47.706 --> 41:50.507
You got a secret plan
to be an astronaut?

41:50.509 --> 41:53.209
No, James, but that doesn't mean
I wasn't inspired by it.

41:53.211 --> 41:56.279
No, I know what you're really
going to miss.

41:56.281 --> 41:58.047
Oh, yeah?
Please enlighten me.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.849
Cuteoverload.com.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.919
You're on it every day watching
kittens wrestle with puppies.

42:02.921 --> 42:05.255
That sounds very dangerous.
Why would they do that?

42:05.257 --> 42:06.990
You know me so well.

42:06.992 --> 42:09.559
Becky, what about you?

42:10.728 --> 42:13.963
Um, I guess if I had
to pick one thing,

42:13.965 --> 42:16.266
it would be...

42:16.268 --> 42:18.134
volunteering.

42:18.136 --> 42:20.069
(All snickering)

42:21.539 --> 42:22.672
BECKY:
What?

42:22.674 --> 42:24.207
What'd I say?

42:24.209 --> 42:25.308
I love it.

42:25.310 --> 42:26.843
LILY:
Are you fucking serious?

42:26.845 --> 42:28.278
JAMES:
To volunteering.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.580
ALL:
To volunteering.
(Glasses clinking together)

42:32.182 --> 42:34.183
(Footsteps thumping)

42:34.185 --> 42:36.252
(Gate creaking)

42:36.254 --> 42:38.121
(Tinkling)

42:48.132 --> 42:49.832
(Tricycle bell dinging)

42:53.571 --> 42:55.238
What's your name, little lady?

42:55.240 --> 42:56.873
Hannah.

42:56.875 --> 42:58.675
LILY:
Can I help you?

43:00.611 --> 43:03.079
We're with the National Guard
Regional Support Group.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.782
We're here to gather information
on who's in the area,

43:05.784 --> 43:07.951
see what resources are needed.

43:07.953 --> 43:10.620
How did you get past the gate?

43:13.591 --> 43:14.791
JAMES:
Good-looking horses.

43:14.793 --> 43:17.660
They look a lot like
our neighbour's.

43:17.662 --> 43:20.163
Our Humvee busted
so we borrowed them.

43:20.165 --> 43:21.965
Kyle here nearly got thrown off.

43:21.967 --> 43:24.100
Tried to ride it like I seen
in the movies, but it spooked.

43:24.102 --> 43:26.069
You asked before taking them,
right?

43:26.071 --> 43:27.737
That's what borrowing mean,
don't it?

43:27.739 --> 43:29.138
(Clearing throat)

43:29.140 --> 43:31.107
It's a really nice setup
you have here.

43:31.109 --> 43:34.711
Definitely better than the other
houses we visited so far.

43:35.827 --> 43:38.147
You know, this would be a good
place for us to set up base.

43:38.149 --> 43:39.682
Canvas the area.

43:39.684 --> 43:41.351
I mean, we're fine to crash
on the couch.

43:41.353 --> 43:43.820
Whatever's available.

43:43.822 --> 43:45.388
They're just trying to help.

43:45.390 --> 43:47.090
They need information
to allocate resources.

43:47.092 --> 43:48.825
Right. That's why they need
my social security number.

43:48.827 --> 43:51.661
I'm with Benji.
Fuck the Man.

43:52.696 --> 43:54.097
And what are you guys
going to do?

43:54.099 --> 43:55.398
Hide?

43:55.400 --> 43:56.899
They have guns.

43:56.901 --> 43:58.234
They're supposed to have guns,
Lily.

43:58.236 --> 43:59.836
They're soldiers.

43:59.838 --> 44:01.638
I don't know, man.
They really creep me out.

44:01.640 --> 44:02.705
LEV:
We have a gun.

44:02.707 --> 44:03.906
Jesus Christ.

44:03.908 --> 44:05.108
Why do you have that?

44:05.110 --> 44:07.110
Lev?
I found it.

44:07.112 --> 44:08.244
It's loaded.

44:08.246 --> 44:10.647
Fucking A.
I can't believe you brought

44:10.649 --> 44:12.115
a loaded gun into my house.

44:12.117 --> 44:13.950
I'm sorry.

44:13.952 --> 44:15.685
Look, I don't think we have
any other choice

44:15.687 --> 44:17.754
but to cooperate
with these guys.

44:17.756 --> 44:19.188
This is my home,
not a military base.

44:19.190 --> 44:21.124
They need a place to stay.
It's not going to happen.

44:21.126 --> 44:23.359
Well, I think we should
put it to a vote.

44:23.361 --> 44:26.362
It's not up for debate.
All in favour, raise your hand.

44:26.364 --> 44:27.897
Becky?

44:27.899 --> 44:30.733
They can't force us
to let them stay here.

44:30.735 --> 44:34.037
Unless Congress has declared war
and passed a resolution

44:34.039 --> 44:36.739
requiring quarter,
in which is unlikely

44:36.741 --> 44:38.675
given how quickly
everything has happened.

44:38.677 --> 44:40.810
LAURA:
Third Amendment.

44:42.780 --> 44:45.915
The Constitution
is the bedrock of our freedoms.

44:45.917 --> 44:48.251
You really should be
more familiar with it.

45:01.799 --> 45:05.101
We are not going to be able
to let you stay here.

45:07.037 --> 45:11.107
Uh, we're on official orders.
If we want to stay, we'll stay.

45:11.109 --> 45:13.776
You ever hear of a little thing
called the Constitution?

45:13.778 --> 45:15.278
"No soldier shall,
in time of peace,

45:15.280 --> 45:17.780
"be quartered in any house
without the consent

45:17.782 --> 45:19.782
"of the owner,
nor in time of war,

45:19.784 --> 45:21.484
"but in a manner
to be prescribed by law."

45:21.486 --> 45:24.187
I'm a soldier. My orders come
from the Commander-in-Chief.

45:24.189 --> 45:27.256
Actually, this is under
the jurisdiction of Congress.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.795
Kyle, why don't you go ahead
and take a look around inside

45:32.797 --> 45:34.330
while I get everybody's ID?

45:34.332 --> 45:37.900
The right of the people to be
secure in their person's houses

45:37.902 --> 45:39.202
papers and effects

45:39.204 --> 45:41.204
against unreasonable searches
and seizures

45:41.206 --> 45:42.338
shall not be violated.

45:42.340 --> 45:44.874
I brought you snacks
for the road.

45:48.779 --> 45:49.912
(Sighing)

45:49.914 --> 45:51.848
This is your house, right?

45:52.783 --> 45:53.950
Yeah.

45:53.952 --> 45:55.518
So that's your pretty little

45:55.520 --> 45:57.220
wife and daughter
we met earlier?

45:57.222 --> 45:59.856
That's right.

45:59.858 --> 46:01.758
So who are these people?

46:01.760 --> 46:04.293
They're my guests.

46:06.296 --> 46:08.965
So we're not good enough
to be your guests.

46:08.967 --> 46:11.167
I didn't say that.

46:14.271 --> 46:16.105
Of course you didn't.

46:16.107 --> 46:19.142
Thank you for your hospitality.

46:23.380 --> 46:24.981
Come on, Kyle. Let's go.

46:40.531 --> 46:43.132
Okay, so we take the photodiode
from the remote control,

46:43.134 --> 46:45.868
we use the OneTouch
on the cell phone,

46:45.870 --> 46:47.003
run it through the baby monitor.

46:47.005 --> 46:48.971
And you have a security system.

46:48.973 --> 46:50.907
Where'd you learn
how to do this?

46:50.909 --> 46:53.209
I did some research
on motion sensors

46:53.211 --> 46:55.278
when I was working in Lebanon.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.979
As a programmer?

46:56.981 --> 46:58.281
A private consultant.

46:58.283 --> 47:00.283
Doing what?

47:00.285 --> 47:02.318
It's private.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.954
I'm mostly just plugged
in computers.

47:06.290 --> 47:08.591
Okay, water's pumped
from the well over here

47:08.593 --> 47:10.426
into that tank over there.

47:10.428 --> 47:12.361
Everything's powered
by the solar panel.

47:12.363 --> 47:14.964
If the pump doesn't break
and the filter lasts,

47:14.966 --> 47:16.933
we should be okay
for a couple of years.

47:16.935 --> 47:19.869
Nick, it's important
someone else knows this

47:19.871 --> 47:21.037
in case something happens to me.

47:21.039 --> 47:22.538
What is going to happen to you?

47:22.540 --> 47:24.173
I have a daughter.

47:24.175 --> 47:27.210
Making sure she's taken care of
means something to me.

47:27.212 --> 47:29.111
What about Lily?

47:30.414 --> 47:31.848
What about her?

47:31.850 --> 47:34.050
Hey, the President's on again.

47:39.456 --> 47:40.990
(Whispering):
Fuck.

47:40.992 --> 47:42.925
PRESIDENT:
<i>Americans stand together</i>

47:42.927 --> 47:45.161
<i>and reach out a helping hand.</i>

47:45.163 --> 47:48.197
<i>I want to assure you that</i>
<i>the government is operating,</i>

47:48.199 --> 47:51.934
<i>and full continuity of service</i>
<i>will resume soon.</i>

47:51.936 --> 47:53.936
<i>My first priority is dealing</i>
<i>with those areas</i>

47:53.938 --> 47:55.972
<i>most immediate.</i>

47:55.974 --> 47:58.074
<i>Emergency teams</i>
<i>are on the ground</i>

47:58.076 --> 48:00.877
<i>working to help control</i>
<i>the chaos.</i>

48:00.879 --> 48:02.912
<i>This is a serious time,</i>

48:02.914 --> 48:06.315
<i>but we are a serious people.</i>

48:06.317 --> 48:07.917
<i>Make no mistake...</i>

48:07.919 --> 48:09.518
That's what he said last time.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.454
<i>We'll find those responsible</i>
<i>and bring them to justice.</i>

48:11.456 --> 48:14.156
It's a fucking loop.

48:15.492 --> 48:17.193
It's worse than that.

48:17.195 --> 48:20.630
This is a pre-recorded generic
post-catastrophic event message.

48:20.632 --> 48:22.231
"We are a serious people."

48:22.233 --> 48:24.267
That's code to communicate
to certain parties

48:24.269 --> 48:26.302
that martial law is in effect.

48:26.304 --> 48:27.904
What parties?

48:27.906 --> 48:29.105
Any operatives
who may be unreachable

48:29.107 --> 48:31.374
through standard
communication protocol.

48:31.376 --> 48:34.076
Senator Reese
was a senior member

48:34.078 --> 48:35.444
of the Homeland Security
Committee.

48:35.446 --> 48:38.114
I read every brief.
I was his closest advisor.

48:38.116 --> 48:40.983
Trust me, this is for real.

48:49.559 --> 48:51.193
I loved him.

48:52.629 --> 48:54.397
Who?

48:54.399 --> 48:56.198
The senator.

48:58.635 --> 49:00.202
He love you back?

49:01.305 --> 49:04.373
He said he did.
I don't know.

49:04.375 --> 49:06.309
Maybe not.

49:07.244 --> 49:09.412
Men aren't very nice to me.

49:09.414 --> 49:11.113
(Sighing)

49:11.115 --> 49:13.950
Yeah, well, maybe that's because
they think they don't have to.

49:13.952 --> 49:16.319
You're very tough.

49:16.321 --> 49:17.687
Am I?

49:17.689 --> 49:19.455
Yeah.

49:19.457 --> 49:23.426
You challenged the dean
of the law school to a debate,

49:23.428 --> 49:25.061
and won.

49:25.063 --> 49:26.963
I did do that, didn't I?

49:26.965 --> 49:29.031
Mmm.
Mmm.

49:30.434 --> 49:31.467
Hmm.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.235
I'm not saying
you have to change.

49:33.237 --> 49:35.705
I'm just thinking maybe
you should find a guy

49:35.707 --> 49:37.206
that's more like a girl.

49:37.208 --> 49:38.341
(Laughing)

49:38.343 --> 49:39.976
Jesus Christ, Benji.

49:39.978 --> 49:42.378
(Laughing)
That is terrible advice.

49:42.380 --> 49:44.547
You know I'm right, though.

49:44.549 --> 49:46.182
(Both laughing)

49:52.456 --> 49:55.224
God, what do you think's
happening down there?

49:56.493 --> 49:58.094
Nothing good.

49:58.096 --> 50:00.329
Then why aren't we
doing anything?

50:00.331 --> 50:04.066
Benji, I need you in the cabin.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.435
(Sighing)

50:10.073 --> 50:12.108
What's up?

50:12.110 --> 50:14.510
I'm high.
I want to fuck.

50:24.554 --> 50:26.555
It's the end of the world...

50:28.091 --> 50:29.492
Yeah.
...in case you hadn't noticed.

50:29.494 --> 50:30.793
Yeah, I noticed.

50:30.795 --> 50:33.562
So I'm preoccupied.

50:33.564 --> 50:36.165
Oh, okay. So you're too
preoccupied

50:36.167 --> 50:37.633
with the collapse
of civilization

50:37.635 --> 50:39.568
to fuck me right now?

50:39.570 --> 50:43.105
Yeah, and people's lives
are at stake out there.

50:43.107 --> 50:44.640
People are the problem.

50:44.642 --> 50:47.376
It doesn't mean we shouldn't
care when people get hurt.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.578
People brought this
on themselves.

50:49.580 --> 50:51.647
It's way more complicated
than that.

50:55.185 --> 50:58.087
I thought you were a real
revolutionary.

50:58.089 --> 51:00.356
Guess I was wrong.

51:02.392 --> 51:04.393
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

51:04.395 --> 51:06.128
You're all talk.

51:06.130 --> 51:08.531
Everyone likes to make speeches,

51:08.533 --> 51:09.832
but at the end of the day

51:09.834 --> 51:12.268
they're all just selling
something, aren't they?

51:12.270 --> 51:15.271
What were you selling, Benji?

51:19.810 --> 51:22.078
Benji, you all right?

51:22.080 --> 51:23.579
No.

51:32.155 --> 51:35.458
Hey, it's time for dinner.

51:35.460 --> 51:37.093
Are you okay?

51:37.095 --> 51:39.228
He said I have to leave.

51:40.797 --> 51:42.832
Where am I supposed to go?
No.

51:42.834 --> 51:45.167
You can stay as long
as you need.

51:46.403 --> 51:48.104
Yeah, you can stay at the house.

51:48.106 --> 51:49.438
Thank you.

51:55.812 --> 51:57.746
You're so amazing.

51:57.748 --> 52:00.182
And you take care of everybody.

52:08.825 --> 52:10.326
I'll see you up there.

52:10.328 --> 52:12.128
Okay?

52:19.257 --> 52:21.137
So you need to put a lot
of pressure on the rock

52:21.139 --> 52:22.771
to keep the drill
straight up and down.

52:22.773 --> 52:25.741
And then you use your shin
to stabilize your left hand.

52:25.743 --> 52:27.276
I was an Eagle Scout.

52:27.278 --> 52:30.179
LEV:
Isn't that just for boys?

52:30.181 --> 52:32.248
My dad was a troop leader.

52:32.250 --> 52:34.483
I'm on the books
as Lawrence Sheppard.

52:34.485 --> 52:36.185
Oh.

52:50.534 --> 52:51.867
Yeah.

52:51.869 --> 52:53.469
Nice.

52:56.640 --> 52:59.175
See? Told you.

52:59.910 --> 53:01.710
Laura's magic.

53:04.447 --> 53:06.315
I'm going to go get
some more firewood.

53:20.830 --> 53:22.932
You catch any more wild pigs?

53:22.934 --> 53:27.303
No, but Mitch set some small
traps for rabbits and such.

53:27.305 --> 53:28.837
It's kind of late
to be out wandering.

53:28.839 --> 53:30.906
TRISHA:
Our place is just a straight
shot down the hill.

53:30.908 --> 53:33.576
James or Lily around?

53:33.578 --> 53:35.311
We've been keeping
our heads down.

53:35.313 --> 53:37.646
It's been rough for folks
at outlying farms.

53:37.648 --> 53:40.649
We thought it was best to circle
the wagons down at her place.

53:40.651 --> 53:42.918
That's a good idea.
TRISH:
Reason we come up,

53:42.920 --> 53:45.688
the biker gangs on their way
out of town raided the clinic.

53:45.690 --> 53:48.691
We got someone who come down
with an infection,

53:48.693 --> 53:51.327
so we're collecting leftover
medicines.

53:52.796 --> 53:57.933
Yeah. We don't really keep that
kind of stuff laying around.

53:57.935 --> 54:00.002
Mention it to Lily,
if you would.

54:00.004 --> 54:01.637
Okay.

54:10.814 --> 54:12.615
(Clock ticking)

54:19.956 --> 54:21.857
(Tap water running and shut off)

54:56.726 --> 54:59.461
(Typing)

55:02.499 --> 55:03.832
(Camera shutter clicking)

55:19.783 --> 55:21.383
(Sighing)

55:41.738 --> 55:44.340
I heard Trisha was here.

55:44.342 --> 55:46.942
Yeah, she came by last night.

55:46.944 --> 55:48.077
What did she want?

55:48.079 --> 55:50.045
Nothing much.

55:50.047 --> 55:51.613
There were some people
down there

55:51.615 --> 55:52.915
setting up camp at her place.

55:52.917 --> 55:54.783
How many people?

55:55.985 --> 55:57.519
She didn't say.

55:57.521 --> 56:00.556
Well, should we invite
some of them up here?

56:00.558 --> 56:02.057
Right. That's all we need.

56:02.059 --> 56:03.992
More people to take care of.

56:03.994 --> 56:05.661
Well, if they need help.

56:05.663 --> 56:07.029
Nick, we can handle this.
NICK:
Just saying.

56:07.031 --> 56:09.098
I mean, maybe I should have
some say in the matter.

56:09.100 --> 56:10.766
Yeah? And why is that?

56:10.768 --> 56:12.601
Oh, you know, because of
the property and everything.

56:12.603 --> 56:14.570
What are you talking about?

56:14.572 --> 56:16.705
You never told her?

56:16.707 --> 56:18.674
What haven't you told me?

56:18.676 --> 56:20.376
Uh, it's not a big deal.

56:20.378 --> 56:23.379
It's just that, um, officially

56:23.381 --> 56:24.747
I co-own the house
with Lily.

56:24.749 --> 56:26.615
That's not how I would put it.

56:26.617 --> 56:27.983
BECKY:
Wait a second.

56:27.985 --> 56:29.451
What?

56:29.453 --> 56:31.387
Lily's mom passed
when we were in college.

56:31.389 --> 56:34.757
The taxes were piling up

56:34.759 --> 56:36.458
and she was going to have
to sell the house.

56:36.460 --> 56:37.993
We were engaged.

56:37.995 --> 56:40.396
You guys were engaged?
JAMES:
Yeah, but it wasn't real.

56:40.398 --> 56:41.864
She broke up with him
a month later.

56:41.866 --> 56:43.632
Why would you keep that from me?

56:43.634 --> 56:45.768
It doesn't matter,
because Nick isn't really

56:45.770 --> 56:49.171
an owner in the house
so much as an investor.

56:49.173 --> 56:50.739
That's the same argument
you used

56:50.741 --> 56:52.007
to gain control of the business,
isn't it?

56:52.009 --> 56:53.709
JAMES:
No, it's not the same thing,

56:53.711 --> 56:55.611
because Nick specifically
violated our ethics code

56:55.613 --> 56:57.746
when he tried to sell users'
private data.

56:57.748 --> 56:59.081
And that's exactly what made
the company valuable

56:59.083 --> 57:00.616
when you eventually sold it.

57:00.618 --> 57:01.750
You shared in that profit
per the settlement.

57:01.752 --> 57:03.452
So did you!
Hey, guys...

57:03.454 --> 57:05.421
And what they chose to do with
the company after we sold it

57:05.423 --> 57:07.923
is on their heads, not mine.

57:07.925 --> 57:09.758
Wow, you're a real
piece of work.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.193
We're ready to buy you out.

57:11.195 --> 57:13.695
I already have
a cashier's cheque

57:13.697 --> 57:15.431
cut for half
the current appraisal.

57:15.433 --> 57:17.065
Is that why you invited us here.

57:17.067 --> 57:18.200
No, it's not.
Actually, yes.

57:18.202 --> 57:19.668
James.
In part.

57:19.670 --> 57:21.437
And why should we trust
your appraisal?

57:21.439 --> 57:23.672
I had three separate appraisals
done and I chose the highest.

57:23.674 --> 57:25.574
I could have averaged them.

57:25.576 --> 57:27.443
And is the land on that hill
out front farmable?

57:27.445 --> 57:28.777
If terraced, yeah.

57:28.779 --> 57:30.646
And you've got a dedicated well,
and solar power.

57:30.648 --> 57:32.047
Becky, I'm talking to Nick.

57:32.049 --> 57:33.849
We're in the middle
of an apocalypse.

59:08.678 --> 59:11.647
There's a reason
that all this happened.

59:14.617 --> 59:16.652
I know we're supposed
to be together.

59:20.189 --> 59:22.558
James doesn't appreciate you.

Have you seen Nick?

59:43.914 --> 59:45.647
No.

59:47.317 --> 59:49.885
Did he give you a ring?

59:49.887 --> 59:51.053
What, just now?

59:52.188 --> 59:53.889
When you were engaged.

59:53.891 --> 59:55.324
Oh. Yeah.

59:55.326 --> 59:58.160
Um, it was his grandmother's.

59:58.162 --> 59:59.895
But I gave it back.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:02.931
Hmm.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:05.968
Becky...

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.037
you're really lucky to have him.

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:13.075
He's kind and he's loving.

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:14.743
And he listens.

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:18.313
James fell out of love with me

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:20.716
when he fell in love
with Hannah.

01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:22.884
He wouldn't even notice
if I was gone.

01:00:22.886 --> 01:00:25.153
I'm sure that's not true.

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:29.324
I really don't belong here.

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:31.093
(Sighing)

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:34.062
BECKY:
You know, it's your home.

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:37.733
You can make it
whatever you want it to be.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.937
Why don't you come inside.

01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:44.172
I think Laura and Lev
have a surprise for us.

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:50.078
The time is now near at hand,

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.947
which must probably determine

01:00:51.949 --> 01:00:54.416
whether Americans
will be free men

01:00:54.418 --> 01:00:56.018
or slaves.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:00.756
The fate of unborn millions
will now depend under God

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:04.192
on the courage and conduct
of this army.

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:06.728
Our cruel and unrelenting enemy

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:09.831
leaves us only the choice
of brave resistance,

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.434
or the most abject submission.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:14.836
We must therefore resolve

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.439
whether to conquer or die!

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:18.974
(All clapping)

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:20.208
Yes! Yes!

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:21.877
Hear, hear.

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:24.212
Amazing.
(Nick whooping)

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.984
Here's another one.
Uh...

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:31.953
Two guys walk into a bar.

01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:33.855
The first guy asks for H2O.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:35.157
The second guy says,

01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:37.693
"That sounds good.
I'll have H2O too."

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.428
The second guy died.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:41.863
(Laughing)

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:48.270
I know I'm not the only one
who didn't get that.

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:52.307
Okay, I'll be reciting a poem
that I wrote,

01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:54.076
called "All the Little Animals."

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:58.246
And it's about how nicely
we should treat animals, Hannah.

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:04.886
All the little animals
sitting in a row.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.456
They have paw and claw,
we have foot and toe.

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:12.127
On the outside they seem so
different from you and from me.

01:02:12.129 --> 01:02:15.330
But on the inside,
they're the same as us.

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:16.798
Can't you see?

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.935
They want to be held
and loved so much.

01:02:19.937 --> 01:02:24.272
Just like the Canadians,
the Chinese and the Dutch.

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:27.943
Yay!

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:29.111
Whoo!

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:31.880
Whoo!

01:02:31.882 --> 01:02:33.448
And is this your card?

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.150
Nope.

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:38.253
It's not?
JAMES: No.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.421
It's that?

Real magicians never tell.

01:02:52.503 --> 01:02:55.036
But you're not a real
magician, so how'd you do it?

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:59.407
You know, I don't understand
why people like magic.

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:02.010

it worked it'd be interesting,

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:03.311

You can wax a ball.

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:06.061
Wait, hang on. Does hair grown
directly from the balls?

01:06:06.063 --> 01:06:09.631
Or is it just encased in a bed
of surrounding hair?

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:11.399
That's a good question.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.210
Do your balls grow hair
directly from them,

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:27.082
or are they more like encased
in a bed of surrounding hair?

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:30.318
Seriously, James,
we really need to know.

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:37.592
What?
I took your advice.

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:39.127
I went for it.

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:42.063
No.

01:06:42.065 --> 01:06:45.033
I was telling you
to be honest with yourself.

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:49.004
I wasn't telling you
to sabotage a marriage.

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:50.538
You told me to do this.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.441
No, this is not my fault.

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:56.444
(Scoffing)

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:58.246
You know what?
You're right.

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:00.648
Why should I take advice
from you?

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.551
I mean, are you really deciding
what you want and going for it?

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:06.721
You're a loser
who lives in a shack.

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:08.643
You never had an adult
relationship in your life.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.229
I went to prison
for going for it, all right?

01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:16.631
So don't sit here and tell me...
You set some shit on fire

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:19.334
a long fucking time ago.

01:07:19.336 --> 01:07:21.302
It was childish and stupid.

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:24.039
Is that all you want?

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.077
Really?

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:31.346
NICK:
Yeah.

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:33.782
Okay.

01:07:33.784 --> 01:07:35.250
Good night, then.

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:38.353
(Door opening and closing)

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:03.144
(Whispering):
What are you doing?

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.481
(Whispering):
Jailbreak.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:10.518
Don't worry.
I'm not a snitch.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.627
You have got to stop acting
like a child.

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:23.430
What? We're not allowed to have
any fun in the apocalypse?

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:25.433
Do you realize how dire
our situation is right now?

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.635
I'm trying to hold us together
for Hannah's sake.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:28.837
(Laughing)

01:08:28.839 --> 01:08:31.139
A stellar job so far.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.640
Aces, really.

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:35.210
You're embarrassing yourself.

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:36.711
And you're embarrassing me.

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.645
(Laughing)

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:44.319
I want a divorce.

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:51.526
(Sighing)

01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:54.129
What? You've got nothing to say.
How do you want me to respond?

01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:55.430
I'm dealing with real problems.

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:57.465
And our marriage
isn't a real problem?

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.767
Not compared
to our survival, no.

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:01.402
(Door closing)

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:12.412
Okay.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:17.152
(Wood splintering)

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:29.564
TRISHA:
We got soldiers at our farm now.

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:31.599
Those guys?

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.636
Yeah, well,
they offered protection

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:37.305
and enough people felt like
we needed it.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:39.707
They eat our food,
don't pitch in,

01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:41.176
move up on some of the girls.

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:42.510
Mitch stood up to them

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.912
and they locked him
in the shed overnight.

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:46.346
Jesus.
The main one, Damon,

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:48.550
he's been talking about you,

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.920
and this solar-powered
castle up here.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.621
People are starting to listen.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:57.458
They don't like this house
full of outsiders.

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.494
We've been here for years.

01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:02.830
They sent me up here
to ask nicely for the medicine.

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:04.499
Or else.

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:06.401
What medicine?

01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:07.702
James...

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.805
That girl, Ariel,

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:12.473
she's staying with us now.

01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:15.710
She told us about
your storeroom.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:17.579
I understand your request.

01:10:17.581 --> 01:10:20.348
You should have helped me out
the first time I asked.

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:23.351
Things would be different now.

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:30.291
BENJI:
I say we hand over the medicine.

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:31.659
LILY:
Can't there be some
middle ground?

01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:33.628
No. We cannot start
giving into their threats.

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:34.963
Can't we just give them half?

01:10:34.965 --> 01:10:36.664
We are going to need
that medicine.

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:38.466
The medicine is not
the fucking issue.

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:39.968
The issue is they need help
kicking out those soldiers

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:41.569
before it gets worse down there.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:43.271
They're armed. What do you
want to do, start a war?

01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:44.439
We didn't start it.

01:10:44.441 --> 01:10:46.474
Yeah, but we can't finish it.

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:48.610
Where are you going?
I need to think.

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:54.482
(Sighing)

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:15.670
(Sighing)

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:29.477
♪

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.798
(Metal trap snapping)

01:11:50.773 --> 01:11:52.307
Fuck.

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:07.388
Son of a bitch.

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.429
(Gasping)

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:34.415
(Whispering inaudibly)

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:38.119
You guys, has anybody seen
Hannah's bear?

01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:39.687
(Phone ringing)

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.689
Hey, the phones
are working again.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.658
No, it's the security system.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.626
Somebody's in the storage shed.

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.896
(Bottles clattering)

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.501
(Damon laughing)

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:58.439
Now, when she told me
about all the good shit

01:12:58.441 --> 01:12:59.607
you were hoarding up here,

01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:02.577
I honestly thought
she was lying.

01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:03.978
I mean, I said the guy
was a selfish prick,

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.747
but that is just over the line.

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:08.483
Put the frying pan down, son.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:11.652
KYLE:
Damon.

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:13.721
JAMES:
That's a filter for the well.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.991
We're happy to share
drinking water with you guys.

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:18.826
Iodine crystals.

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:19.994
Bingo.

01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:22.730
Are you cooking meth
down there, Donny?

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:24.432
You know what kind of people
that attracts?

01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:26.067
Don't pretend you give a shit.

01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:29.404
Hey, Damon, that's the bitch
from the senator's sex video.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:32.039
(Laughing)

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:33.441
I'll be damned. It's her.

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:35.410
I told you.
Hey, Kyle.

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:36.844
Kyle, come.

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:38.946
Go on and tell her
how you used to jerk off to her.

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:50.825
(Screaming) (Bone cracking)

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:54.929
(Laughing)

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.743
Hmm.

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:21.055
(Grunting)

01:14:21.057 --> 01:14:22.890
Do you want to die?!

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:26.661
Damon.
Do not fucking move!

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:38.539
(Laughing)

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:41.843
Homebody pissed
his fucking pants.

01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:43.544
(Laughing)

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:52.687
Why don't you go on inside
and unlock the fridge.

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:57.525
Don't make me ask twice.

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:09.637
JAMES:
Just so you know,

01:15:09.639 --> 01:15:11.506
this particular unit
has a microprocessor

01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:14.709
that keeps them as reliable cold
at negative 20 degrees Celsius.

01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:17.111
Automatic evaporation
tempered thermopane glass

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:18.746
and an air-cooled
condensing unit.

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:21.282
Every day outside this fridge
will reduce their potency,

01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:23.618
and therefore
their street value.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.219
(Keys jiggling)

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:26.988
(Lock clicking)

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:28.556
Do me a favour.

01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:29.891
Box up some of this nice food

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:31.926
when you bring
the fridge down tomorrow.

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:35.930
And I mean all of it.

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:43.804
(Clock ticking)

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:49.977
(Door opening)

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:02.890
I got something to say
that'll cheer everyone up.

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:11.165
I was going to shoot myself
in the head before I came here.

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:14.235
Lev?
LEV: No.

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:17.772
It's okay. It's funny,
because it turns out

01:16:17.774 --> 01:16:20.708
I'm terrified of getting shot
in my head.

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:23.711
Why would you want to do that?

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:25.980
It seemed like the right thing
to do at the time.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.184
But then I heard
about the attacks.

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:31.786
And the power went out.

01:16:31.788 --> 01:16:33.020
I don't know.
I just felt like killing myself

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:35.656
would be potentially redundant.

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:37.959
So I went outside
and walked around for a bit,

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:40.661
and when I came back home there
were FBI agents everywhere.

01:16:40.663 --> 01:16:44.131
Why were there FBI agents
at your apartment, Lev?

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.903
Well, it turns out

01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:52.940
I might be responsible
for this whole thing.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.342
What whole thing?

01:16:54.344 --> 01:16:58.679
This collapse-of-civilization
thing.

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.749
What did you do?

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:06.220
I said goodbye
to everyone at once.

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:08.022
You sent the text.

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:12.159
And the virus that took down
the power grid.

01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:14.328
No. See, here's the thing.

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:16.764
Last year I was hired

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:18.265
to write a kind of super spam
for Smartphones.

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:21.068
The idea was to be able to
hijack the target's address book

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:23.337
and send a single text message
to every contact.

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:26.340
Embedded with a virus
that we spent months planting

01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:27.942
in the most popular apps.

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:29.844
Why would you agree to do that?

01:17:29.846 --> 01:17:32.246
Because it's completely
interesting.

01:17:32.248 --> 01:17:34.949
I mean, the goal was to send
a text message

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:38.052
to every phone on earth,
which could be cool.

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:39.054
Or not.

01:17:39.055 --> 01:17:41.822
And I started to suspect not.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:45.192
So I quit before I finished.

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:49.130
But then someone
hacked my computer,

01:17:49.132 --> 01:17:51.966
and they must have been watching
when I said goodbye,

01:17:51.968 --> 01:17:53.968
because they got
that trigger code

01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:56.003
that they were going to send.

01:17:56.005 --> 01:18:00.007
And probably used it to detonate
that attack on the power grid.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.077
I was just playing around.

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.150
(Typing)

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:13.754
I hacked into Lev's computer
as a joke,

01:18:13.756 --> 01:18:15.289
just to see if I could do it.

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:21.796
LEV:
You're Mr. E?

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:23.764
LILY:
"Mystery."

01:18:23.766 --> 01:18:25.900
Mr. E. Mystery.

01:18:25.902 --> 01:18:28.703
Get it?
It's funny, right?

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:33.307
I didn't do anything, though.

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:37.011
You opened a very locked,
very secured door.

01:18:37.013 --> 01:18:39.180
Some very bad people
walked through it.

01:18:39.182 --> 01:18:41.115
Oops.

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:42.917
BECKY:
Oops?

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:46.053
Just let me...
Let me get this straight.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:48.489
You two idiots

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:50.091
destroyed the world?

01:18:50.093 --> 01:18:52.059
LEV:
Well, we don't know that
for sure.

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:54.161
It could just be this country.

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.900
(Door opening)

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.784
Are they coming for me?

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:19.086
LAURA:
I don't think they're coming
for any of us.

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:23.858
The government's big,
but it's finite.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:26.861
They'll lock down cities
if they can,

01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:29.230
protect our resources,
infrastructure.

01:19:29.232 --> 01:19:32.466
But places like this,
we're on our own.

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:34.268
At least for a while.

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.104
You could turn me in, you know.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:39.406
Find a place
in the new government.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:41.242
Get taken seriously again.

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:44.378
Even if you're not responsible
it won't go well for you.

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:48.349
So, what are you going to do?

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:52.319
I don't know.

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:56.157
That's a real dilemma.

01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:57.391
Yeah.

01:19:57.393 --> 01:19:59.193
We should do a speech test.

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:01.262
What is that?

01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:04.231
Basically what it is is you say
both possible options out loud,

01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:08.235
and whichever one sounds the
most authentic, you go with it.

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:10.304
(Sniffling)

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.273
Okay.

01:20:12.275 --> 01:20:14.542
(Clearing throat)

01:20:14.544 --> 01:20:18.879
I'm going to turn you in at
the first possible opportunity.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.215
How'd that feel?

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:24.885
I don't know, Lev.

01:20:24.887 --> 01:20:26.987
Pretty authentic.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:31.192
(Cawing)

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:50.244
Hi.
Hey.

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:53.214
What are you doing
with an animal trap?

01:20:53.216 --> 01:20:56.217
Just twiddling my thumbs
so they don't fall off.

01:20:56.219 --> 01:21:00.187
We have to take this off
right away.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.589
Okay, hold still.

01:21:01.591 --> 01:21:04.024
Ah.
Sorry.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:05.359
That's okay.

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:10.497
Oh, the spring is stuck.
Mm-hmm.

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:12.032
Do you have a screwdriver?

01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:14.201
I got a knife in my pocket.

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:23.944
Why didn't you come up for help?

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:29.016
Just didn't really
feel like talking to anybody.

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:31.952
(Groaning)

01:21:31.954 --> 01:21:33.287
This should do it.

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:39.493
(Sighing):
My God.

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:41.395
Thank you.

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:44.098
(Sighing)

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:48.969
That is the type of shit
people invent.

01:21:50.593 --> 01:21:52.273
I really don't understand
how it's possible

01:21:52.275 --> 01:21:54.275
not to hate every single
fucking one of us.

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:58.178
(Sighing)

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:03.217
Before my father left us,

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:05.419
he taught me how to set
squirrel traps.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:09.023
And sometimes we'd get lucky
and we'd get a rabbit.

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.160
And I was always the one
who had to kill it,

01:22:13.162 --> 01:22:14.662
because my mom was never there,

01:22:14.664 --> 01:22:18.098
and I wasn't going to make my
sisters do anything like that.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:21.001
So I'd take a rock

01:22:21.003 --> 01:22:23.070
and bash its head in.

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:30.511
Why did you just tell me that?

01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:36.984
Because I believe in hell.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.954
And I know evil exists.

01:22:39.956 --> 01:22:41.455
I mean, I've...

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:47.394
But I also know
that good is stronger than evil.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.032
Which is why I survived.

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:58.238
Becky...

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:04.211
I got to tell you something.

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:06.580
What?

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:15.756
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

01:23:15.758 --> 01:23:18.525
I don't think so.

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:20.728
You should just say it.

01:23:20.730 --> 01:23:22.363
I don't...
I don't know what...

01:23:22.365 --> 01:23:24.498
If you still loved her
why did you marry me?

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:41.115
Is that why we're here?

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:44.451
You thought you had
another chance with her?

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:50.290
So you kissed her.

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:52.459
Yes.

01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.331
And now?

01:24:00.769 --> 01:24:02.569
Sorry.

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:08.409
You promised me.

01:24:08.411 --> 01:24:10.310
You promised God.

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:13.247
Don't touch me.

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:15.582
Don't you ever touch me again.

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:20.120
It's perfectly clear
that none of you liked me then,

01:24:20.122 --> 01:24:22.322
and none of you like me now.

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:31.165
JAMES:
Nick, you have to go.

01:24:31.167 --> 01:24:33.167
I don't want to see you here.

01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:35.135
I don't want you
around my daughter,

01:24:35.137 --> 01:24:37.071
and I don't want you
around my wife.

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:41.775
Actually, James,
I think you need to go.

01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:43.444
Nick, don't.

01:24:43.446 --> 01:24:45.512
You want him or you want me?

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:50.517
You wanted a divorce.

01:24:50.519 --> 01:24:52.686
You're clearly
running around with Nick.

01:24:52.688 --> 01:24:55.656
So you get what you want.
But you don't get the house.

01:24:57.459 --> 01:24:59.293
Don't be here when I get back.

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:05.265
(Truck door slamming,
engine starting)

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.587
DAMON:
Where's the fridge, asshole?

01:25:26.589 --> 01:25:27.821
Hey, I'm talking to you!

01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:29.423
I'm here to talk
to my neighbours.

01:25:29.425 --> 01:25:31.125
Oh, so now
we're your neighbours.

01:25:31.127 --> 01:25:33.627
Yeah. When did it start
becoming okay

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:35.462
to steal and threaten
each other?

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:37.331
No one stole shit
from you, dude.

01:25:37.333 --> 01:25:39.833
Yesterday your soldier buddies
came into my house

01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:41.702
and took some wine
and chocolate.

01:25:41.704 --> 01:25:43.570
Fuck you, man.
We're eating Spam down here.

01:25:43.572 --> 01:25:45.873
Whatever you've got to say,
James, you better say it fast.

01:25:45.875 --> 01:25:49.843
If I give you our medicine,
what's to stop these guys

01:25:49.845 --> 01:25:51.145
from selling it?

01:25:51.147 --> 01:25:53.347
And using it to control you?

01:25:53.349 --> 01:25:55.749
Anybody who is sick
can come up to my house

01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:57.351
and you will be given care.

01:25:57.353 --> 01:25:58.752
So you get to decide
to who gets the medicine

01:25:58.754 --> 01:25:59.887
and who doesn't?

01:25:59.889 --> 01:26:01.555
I stocked up on that stuff.

01:26:01.557 --> 01:26:03.490
I get a little say
on how it's used.

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:05.359
WOMAN:
Sounds like death kennels.

01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:07.561
That's not what I'm saying.
My point is that if we...

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.565
What's your point?

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:14.768
(Coughing and groaning)

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:18.438
This man is a criminal.

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.279
(Coughing)

01:26:26.714 --> 01:26:29.383
He didn't help our friend Donny
over here

01:26:29.385 --> 01:26:31.285
when he was being robbed.

01:26:31.287 --> 01:26:33.287
He just drove off.

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:39.359
He put us all at risk
storing away his medicine.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:42.462
This is the kind of person
I've been talking about.

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:44.965
(Coughing)

01:26:44.967 --> 01:26:47.501
People who take advantage.

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:52.573
It is time that we send
a clear message.

01:26:52.575 --> 01:26:55.509
That we are not going to bow.

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:58.345
To people of this type anymore.

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:03.283
No. no, please.

01:27:03.285 --> 01:27:04.451
Please don't do this. I'm...

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:06.687
(Gunshot) (All gasping)

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.594
Fuck.

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:24.838
The time is now near at hand...

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.342
That must probably determine

01:27:28.344 --> 01:27:31.979
whether Americans
will be free men

01:27:31.981 --> 01:27:33.847
or slaves.

01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:36.984
The fate of unborn millions

01:27:36.986 --> 01:27:39.753
will now depend under God

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:43.924
on the courage and conduct
of this army.

01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:47.261
We must therefore resolve

01:27:47.263 --> 01:27:49.596
to conquer or die.

01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:52.599
What the fuck are you
talking about? Conquer who?

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:56.536
The enemy is us.

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:07.714
Each moment is an agreement.

01:28:07.716 --> 01:28:11.752
An agreement to live
in a certain kind of world,

01:28:11.754 --> 01:28:13.420
which is the way
it's always been.

01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:15.589
We've just pretended
like it wasn't.

01:28:16.991 --> 01:28:18.892
This is half of our medicine.

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.701
From now on we work together.

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:43.817
Thank you.
Don't.

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:47.788
(Sobbing)

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:49.923
I just killed somebody!

01:28:49.925 --> 01:28:52.059
James, I just killed somebody!

01:28:52.061 --> 01:28:53.794
I just killed somebody!

01:28:53.796 --> 01:28:54.961
You just saved my life.

01:28:54.963 --> 01:28:56.697
(Crying)

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:00.334
(Hyperventilating)

01:29:00.336 --> 01:29:01.735
You saved my life.

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:04.871
(Laughing)

01:29:09.577 --> 01:29:10.877
Thank you.

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.648
You're welcome.

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:26.119
♪

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:52.919
Lily.

01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:54.454
Hannah.

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:57.391
Oh!

01:29:57.393 --> 01:29:58.925
I love you, Hannah-bear.

01:30:04.031 --> 01:30:06.666
Where's Lily?

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:12.939
We need to find a place to camp
before nightfall.

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:26.119
We can't go back.

01:30:26.121 --> 01:30:28.121
I have to, Nick.

01:30:28.123 --> 01:30:29.823
Because of Hannah?

01:30:29.825 --> 01:30:31.024
Yeah.

01:30:31.026 --> 01:30:34.628
And because of James.

01:30:38.466 --> 01:30:40.534
Nick, come back.
Please.

01:30:40.536 --> 01:30:42.769
I have always
been there for you!

01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:45.639
When you wanted to start
a company I found the money.

01:30:45.641 --> 01:30:47.674
When you were going to lose
the house I stepped in.

01:30:47.676 --> 01:30:50.510
When have you ever
been there for me?

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:53.480
You don't get to have it
both ways.

01:30:53.482 --> 01:30:56.850
You don't get
to break my heart again

01:30:56.852 --> 01:30:58.185
and still be my friend.

01:30:58.187 --> 01:31:01.188
You really feel like
that's what's happened?

01:31:01.190 --> 01:31:02.956
Yes!
That's bullshit!

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:05.058
You want what you want,

01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:08.028
and you're not willing
to see what's in front of you,

01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:11.064
which is a good fucking friend.

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:18.071
I love you.

01:31:18.073 --> 01:31:19.606
As what? As...

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:22.075
As a friend?
That's bullshit.

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:25.879
It's not bullshit.
It's real.

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:30.884
Come on.

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:42.596
I don't like myself
very much anymore.

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:11.691
Goodbye, bear.

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:19.132
Goodbye, Nick.

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:23.904
(Sniffling)

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.908
Goodbye, world.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.147
(Sighing)

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:45.559
(Crying)

01:32:48.296 --> 01:32:50.697
(Door opening)

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:08.982
She asked me where you were.

01:33:10.184 --> 01:33:12.586
And I couldn't answer.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:16.923
Hey.

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:24.998
(Sighing)

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.834
I'm sorry.

01:33:33.107 --> 01:33:35.075
(Crying)

01:33:35.077 --> 01:33:36.876
Me too.

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:44.084
Do you think...

01:33:44.086 --> 01:33:46.686
Do you think you could
just say that one more time,

01:33:46.688 --> 01:33:48.154
just for the novelty of it?

01:33:48.156 --> 01:33:49.990
(Both laughing)

01:33:51.225 --> 01:33:52.993
I'm sorry.

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:55.929
I'm so sorry.

01:33:55.931 --> 01:33:57.797
Say it again.
I'm sorry.

01:33:57.799 --> 01:33:59.933
(Laughing):
I'm so...
