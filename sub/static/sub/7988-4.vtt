to the Selfridge

Selfridge,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.108
but why are we here?

02:21.266 --> 02:23.109
What do you mean?

02:23.268 --> 02:24.565
The stores are British.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.401
You could have made this
announcement in London

02:26.563 --> 02:28.531
just as lavishly.

I hope this isn't an attempt

I, uh... I'm more use

Besides, young Ralph wanted to
attend the reading tomorrow.

I'm sure I'll see
my father then.

Would you like
to have been there?

03:21.952 --> 03:25.798
I... I prefer to leave my mark

03:25.956 --> 03:27.924
rather than manipulation
of public opinion.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.677
That's a rather hard reading
of the situation,

03:30.836 --> 03:31.758
if I may say so.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.264
Well, you did ask, Mr. Crabb.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.636
Shall we get to work?

03:38.802 --> 03:41.271
REPORTER:

03:41.430 --> 03:44.479

03:44.641 --> 03:48.191
as reason enough for this
announcement, semicolon,

Selfridge has gotten out of town

03:53.150 --> 03:55.778
in order to escape
the familial heat

03:55.944 --> 03:59.994

The chief brought you
over here.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.012
It's only right
you enjoy the scenery.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.555
Oh, a small tab has been
placed on your room too.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.815
Drinks at 6:00

04:24.973 --> 04:26.725

Another puff piece.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.153
Does he think we're stupid?

04:37.319 --> 04:38.662
He can't control us.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.117
Don't be so dull.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.327
I'm just saying there are

04:41.490 --> 04:42.867
better Selfridge stories
out there.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.285
I know you have a good one.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.045
It's a peach,
but I've been warned off.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.751
Orders from Wynnstay himself,
apparently.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.542
Since when do gossip columnists
listen to orders?

04:56.213 --> 04:57.635
The rooms were
an inspired idea.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.799
Never seen hacks so happy.

04:58.965 --> 04:59.807
It's going
to cost you, though.

04:59.966 --> 05:00.933
It's worth it.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.059
Keep 'em well oiled up
tonight.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.391
See what you can pick up.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.520
Always good to be
one step ahead.

Lord Wynnstay's charity.

05:29.704 --> 05:30.830
Who'd have thought?

05:34.209 --> 05:36.678
Don't look at me
with pity, Arthur.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.427
What about your diagnosis?

05:43.593 --> 05:45.470
What I told you was
uttered in haste.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.765
No one else need know
about it.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.478
I am well!

05:49.641 --> 05:50.563
I am able.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.567
Look at me.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.319
Look!

05:53.478 --> 05:55.446
You cannot ignore
what's happening.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.067
I'll be on my rounds.

06:29.472 --> 06:34.023
Sorry, Freddy,
it's... Eeyore's house.

06:34.185 --> 06:39.407
It's not supposed
to be so... sturdy.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.819
What, so just make it
more slapdash?

06:41.985 --> 06:42.907
I can't do that.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.116
I trained at The Slade!

06:44.279 --> 06:45.872
Uh, excuse me...

06:46.031 --> 06:47.283
A little bit more respect

06:47.449 --> 06:49.998
for Mrs. de Bolotoff, please,
Freddy.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.833
It's always me that has
to accommodate.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.751
You know
your A.A. Milne.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.920
Tatiana's been captivated.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.088
I wanted to share the magic

07:02.255 --> 07:06.305
with children who aren't read to
as much as they might have been.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.563
Aw, well, it's
a great cause.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.849
You've thrown this together
really quickly.

07:12.015 --> 07:15.690
My mother-- and especially
my grandmother--

07:15.852 --> 07:18.446
instilled a sense
of practicality.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.778
I guess this is
in honor of them as well.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.035
Well, my favorite's Piglet.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.447
Me too.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.411
Mrs. Towler nabbed me
on the way in;

07:28.573 --> 07:31.167
said she's coming down
to "have a chat."

07:31.326 --> 07:35.877
I know I messed things up.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.211
But I didn't mean to.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.468
It wasn't all my fault.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.300
Let Mrs. Towler
be in charge.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.217
You can be quite...
quite quick to speak.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.886
Rude, do you mean?

07:49.052 --> 07:50.645
Oh...!

07:52.555 --> 07:59.188
Look, when she comes,
just... be respectful.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.446
Practice.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.572
It will help.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.120
(laughing): Now you're
just pulling a silly face.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.030
I'm not!

08:09.823 --> 08:12.076
Ah! Miss Grove.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.499
And how are you today?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.881
Very well, thank you,
Mrs. Towler.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.340
Mmm...

08:23.503 --> 08:25.005
It's nice and neat.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.175
Well done.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.935
I hope whilst you've been down
here you've had time

08:31.094 --> 08:33.972
to reflect on your place
in the store.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.140
Yes, Mrs. Towler.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.567
Good.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.863
Well, gather your things.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.571
Report to Fashion
when you're ready.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.287

08:56.369 --> 08:58.246
CROUPIER:
Faites vos <i>jeux.</i>

09:03.376 --> 09:04.753
Excuse me...

What a wonderful sight.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.431
Pitch in, Harry!

09:12.594 --> 09:15.188
We're in awful trouble.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.314
The Whiteleys aren't
playing fair.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.442
Heard you were in, Selfridge.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.855
<i>A grand party

09:23.021 --> 09:27.071

09:27.233 --> 09:29.156
You play, ladies.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.320
I have some things
to take care of.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.454
Our credit's up.

09:31.613 --> 09:35.368
William's taken the bank
and has licked us clean.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.838
(quietly): Add a thousand
francs to my bill.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.466
Thank you, Harry.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.378
Drinks on us if we win.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.760
Mae! What are you
doing here?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.895
<i>Bonjour, Harry.</i>

09:56.054 --> 09:57.306
Well, I had a little business
in Toulouse

09:57.472 --> 09:58.473
and then Jimmy called,

09:58.640 --> 09:59.857
said that you were having
lots of fun,

10:00.016 --> 10:01.393
so I thought I'd crash
the party.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.435
You don't mind, do you?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.819
Not at all.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.195
Harry, you were wonderful
in there.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.073
They were eating out
of the palm of your hand.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.326
None of it would
be possible

10:09.484 --> 10:10.861
without your stroke
of genius.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.029
Oh, I didn't realize
this was a meeting

10:13.196 --> 10:16.370
of the Harry/Jimmy mutual
appreciation society.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.377
Well, I feel like something
of a lemon now.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.833
Dry as a bone.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.417
That's why I like her.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.832
The bar is open.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.092
Let's have some fun!

10:33.842 --> 10:35.435
FRANK:
Hey George, how are you?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.313
Good to see you.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.190
Oh! Hello.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.191
Sorry.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.148
No harm done, old chap.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.156
Can't take the heat,
Edwards?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.408
Felicity... on full alert
as ever.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.614
That's my job.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.028
An)' scraps?

10:53.194 --> 10:54.411
How are Rosalie and Serge
de Bolotoff?

10:54.571 --> 10:56.289
Can't we have a night off?

10:56.447 --> 10:57.289
Of course.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.620
I'll have a French 75.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.252
<i>Soixante-quinze
and a whisky, merci.</i>

11:01.411 --> 11:04.085
MAE:
...in a state of undress.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.500
<i>I was speechless for</i> once.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.044
But Harry, to be fair,
ever the perfect gentleman,

11:09.210 --> 11:13.260
just cast his eyes skyward and
said, "Oh, what lovely corbels!"

11:13.423 --> 11:14.640
Corbels!

11:14.799 --> 11:16.517
Where did that come from?
I had to say something.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.019
How'd it go?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.600
Not so great, huh?

11:19.762 --> 11:20.888
Right, I'll order
some more champagne.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.352
Yes, please.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.517
Don't let us get too tight
tonight, Harry.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.358
We have a movie audition
tomorrow.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.271
Yes, you do.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.111
Who for?

11:30.273 --> 11:32.776
Oswald Stone,
Stone Pictures.

11:32.942 --> 11:37.573
<i>The Red Stockings,
The Nymph of the Glen?</i>

11:37.739 --> 11:40.162
You've been out of the country
too long, Mae.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.952
I know Mr. Stone
from the club.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.370
Maybe I'll come and watch.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.537
Where's the audition?

11:44.704 --> 11:45.546
Beaconsfield.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.831
The glamour!

11:51.294 --> 11:52.762
Oh, that's better.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.674
This is quite the seduction
Harry's organized.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.093
What's it like being
on the other side?

11:58.259 --> 12:00.887
Are we off the record?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.601
It's hard.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.516
Don't get me wrong,
I enjoy working for Harry

12:04.682 --> 12:05.979
and he's a dear friend.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.737
But on occasions like this
you meet old pals...

12:09.896 --> 12:12.240
cub reporters
when I started out.

12:12.398 --> 12:16.244
Now they're feature writers,
finance editors,

12:16.402 --> 12:17.574
books galore...

12:17.737 --> 12:19.990
Lost opportunities?

12:20.156 --> 12:22.033
One drink and
I'm already maudlin.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.328
Perhaps you just need
another one.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.207
Could I get two bottles
of champagne, yeah?

12:29.374 --> 12:31.342
Care for a drink,
Mr. Dillon?

12:31.501 --> 12:33.879
We've had an awfully
good night.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.968
Mmm... no, no, no,
thank you.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.132
I suppose it's all
Harry's money in the end.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.893
What do you care from
which hand it comes?

12:41.052 --> 12:42.474
Everything okay?

12:42.637 --> 12:44.639
We were just
congratulating Mr. Dillon

12:44.806 --> 12:46.399
on his financial acumen.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.980
The magician of
the Square Mile.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.020
He is a great asset.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.188
Evening, gentlemen.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.322
That's it, Jimmy.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.609
Do as your owner
tells you.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.493
Keep walking, it's fine,
it's fine.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.029
They're just looking
for sport.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.493
(laughing)

13:04.242 --> 13:05.835
Everything all right?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.587
Everything's fine.

13:07.745 --> 13:08.746
Just fine.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.763
Mr. D'Ancona.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.643
What can I do for you?

13:31.269 --> 13:35.649
You know how I deal
with outstanding debts?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.692
First I ask with a smile.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.370
Then I ask without.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.668
Do I owe you something?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.295
You don't owe me anything.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.081
But we have a mutual friend.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.218
I'm trying to be tolerant

13:55.376 --> 13:57.970
but my good nature
is being tested.

13:58.129 --> 14:00.598
Who are you talking about?

14:10.641 --> 14:12.268
Harry owes you money?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.280
(loud chatter, cabaret music)

14:18.274 --> 14:19.821
So the magician...

14:20.943 --> 14:22.945
The magician...

14:28.242 --> 14:30.836
Opened up the orange,
pulled out his signature.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.523
Harry, they're beautiful.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.736
Thank you!

15:03.903 --> 15:06.622
JENNY:
We've won the man lottery.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.033
It's amazing.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.544
You are the most amazing man
I have ever met.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.500
Oh, well, there we are.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.045
(cheers and whistles)

15:31.013 --> 15:34.563
(music continues)

15:34.725 --> 15:38.525
(men yelling and whistling)

15:42.358 --> 15:43.234
(laughing)

15:43.401 --> 15:45.529
(applause)

15:53.286 --> 15:55.835
Rosie!

16:01.002 --> 16:02.925
You're not getting away
with this.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.011
Don't you dare touch
my stuff.

16:06.174 --> 16:09.428
Jenny, what do you think
you are doing?

16:11.220 --> 16:15.316
Ladies, please, I'll get you
both matching necklaces.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.776
Well, that's rather taken the
sheen off things hasn't it?

16:19.937 --> 16:21.439
They really can't behave,
can they?

16:21.606 --> 16:24.325
I think Harry rather enjoys
the spectacle.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.828
Harry loves a spectacle.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.363
Mae, how are you this evening?

16:28.529 --> 16:29.655
I'm sorry, do I know you?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.540
Lord Loxley was a member
of our club.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.372
How marvelous for you.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.286
Not sure he would
have approved

16:35.453 --> 16:38.127
of your choice of...
companion.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.757
But then you are
on holiday.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.135
An "exotic" holiday.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.387
I hear that's the thing
to do this season.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.674
(laughing)

16:47.840 --> 16:49.387
Why don't you two call it
a night?

16:49.550 --> 16:53.225
Why don't you fetch me
a daiquiri?

16:54.680 --> 16:55.602
Jimmy.

17:00.061 --> 17:03.486
Oh, and while you're
at it, polish these.

17:10.445 --> 17:11.663
MAE:
Frank!

17:11.821 --> 17:14.746
FRANK:
Oh, no, come on, come on, boys,

17:14.909 --> 17:17.332
<i>no,</i> look, <i>come on,
listen...</i>

17:17.494 --> 17:18.121
Oh, Jesus!

17:18.287 --> 17:20.255
(grunting)

17:21.165 --> 17:24.294
Get out! Come on!

17:26.671 --> 17:29.550
Come on, Jimmy.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.264
(moaning)

17:32.426 --> 17:33.973
(chuckling):
Are you okay?

17:34.136 --> 17:36.434
Oh boy,
that was exciting.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.520
(bellowing)

17:42.687 --> 17:44.530
Enough! Stop that!

17:44.689 --> 17:45.815
What's got into you?!

17:47.191 --> 17:49.159
You get somewhere,

17:49.318 --> 17:51.161
you achieve something
and there's always,

17:51.320 --> 17:53.414
always someone ready
to push you down!

17:53.573 --> 17:55.917
But they're playboys.

17:56.075 --> 18:00.922
They're vacuous,
desperate, playboys.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.924
Oh, God, let's have a drink
and forget about it.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.085
People say things to you,
don't they?

18:08.754 --> 18:11.633
Is it "the thing to do"?

18:11.799 --> 18:13.267
An "exotic holiday"?

18:13.426 --> 18:15.929
You really saying that to me?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.267
Am I wrong?

18:18.764 --> 18:20.186
(shouting):
Am I wrong?!

18:24.186 --> 18:25.688
People talk.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.574
People say things,
of course they do.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.861
I don't care about any of that.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.574
It's this.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.080
Your temper.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.990
This is what I don't like.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.625
Mae, I'm sorry.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.006
Get some sleep, Jimmy.

19:00.598 --> 19:01.975
(laughing drunkenly)

19:02.141 --> 19:03.643
Shh!

19:06.562 --> 19:07.484
FRANK:
Where are we?

19:07.647 --> 19:10.366
Shh... shh...

19:10.524 --> 19:12.618
Come in quickly.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.882
You know what we forgot
to do tonight?

19:27.041 --> 19:28.042
Eat.

19:29.877 --> 19:30.969
I know a place.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.129
I'll take you there.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.767
All right.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.730
MAE:
I hand it to you, Harry:

19:44.892 --> 19:46.439
you do know all
the best spots.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.025
It's not bad, is it?

19:49.188 --> 19:51.065
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

19:51.232 --> 19:53.030
Sweet couple.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.660
I wonder how long
they've been together.

19:54.819 --> 19:58.494
He looks like her third husband

19:58.656 --> 20:01.250
and she has worn him out.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.752
Pierre looks exhausted.

20:07.707 --> 20:13.385
It's just so calm,
isn't it, so still.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.095
No shrieking,
no glasses clinking.

20:16.257 --> 20:19.602
It makes you realize how fast
everything else is going.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.138
I think we could walk
back to the hotel.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.352
It's a mile or so
along the beach.

20:24.515 --> 20:25.858
Mile-a-minute Harry.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.643
Got to live up to the name.

20:32.064 --> 20:37.537
So... I told you that
I-l came for the party.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.538
Actually I wanted to see you.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.199
Why?

20:41.365 --> 20:45.541
Well, I understand that things
haven't been especially cordial

20:45.703 --> 20:46.545
between you and Gordon.

20:46.704 --> 20:49.378
No-- no, they are fine.

20:49.540 --> 20:53.090
He's not here and
it's been noticed.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.094
Did you invite him?

20:54.253 --> 20:54.924
Of course I did.

20:55.087 --> 20:55.929
He declined.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.058
That must hurt.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.217
(Sighs)

21:00.384 --> 21:02.352
If he wants to miss out
on all the fun,

21:02.511 --> 21:03.637
that's his decision.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.852
Oh, last night wasn't fun,
Harry, it was ugly.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.358
Don't sit in judgment on me.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.358
I'm not.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.064
I get enough of that
from my family.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.195
Ask anyone that's there
today if they had fun.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.230
They'll say they did.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.319
Because you insisted.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.859
Because you control
every single moment.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.286
Could we get the check, please?

21:19.445 --> 21:20.492
<i>L'addition, s'il vous plait.</i>

21:20.654 --> 21:22.327
What, now I've upset you.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.117
<i>Merci.</i>

21:26.285 --> 21:27.161
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

21:27.328 --> 21:29.001
A beautiful place.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.289
Wonderful.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.423
Oh, Harry.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.384
<i>Pardon.</i>

21:34.543 --> 21:35.465
Harry!

21:41.801 --> 21:42.723
Harry!

21:45.554 --> 21:46.931
Harry, Stop!

21:48.891 --> 21:49.813
Stop!

21:54.021 --> 21:55.273
(Sighs)

21:57.650 --> 21:58.902
I keep moving...

22:01.779 --> 22:03.452
because that...

22:03.614 --> 22:04.536
that's all I can do.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.416
I know that.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.703
We're cut from the
same cloth, you and I.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.843
Noise and color

22:16.001 --> 22:17.674
and sex and laughter,

22:17.837 --> 22:19.839
it drowns out an awful lot;

22:20.005 --> 22:22.679
but in the end it all goes
and what will you be left with?

22:23.759 --> 22:26.137
Friendship, yes?

22:26.303 --> 22:27.555
Family.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.566
Make it up with Gordon.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.101
He's your son.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.030
I'm sorry if I upset you.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.245
I'm sorry.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.243
Don't ever apologize again.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.247
I'll fix it.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.293
(Sighs)

22:58.460 --> 23:00.178
I'm thankful
that you're here.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.566
So we don't have to pay
anything?

23:16.729 --> 23:17.821
No. No.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.197
The chief's has got it
all under control.

23:19.356 --> 23:20.232
Thanks very much.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.446
See you in London.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.782
Any chance I could bunk
aboard your plane?

23:23.944 --> 23:25.412
We're full.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.289
So, we have to schlep back
on the boat-train'?

23:27.448 --> 23:28.745
You'll all be home
in three hours.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.161
The party's over, Flic.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.455
From hero to coward,
eh, Frank?

23:33.621 --> 23:34.918
Didn't last night
mean anything?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.253
I was drunk and I
regret it bitterly.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.793
Morning, Frank.
Morning.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.552
Morning, Harry.

23:40.711 --> 23:43.555
I do hope you enjoy the column
I'm going to write.

23:43.714 --> 23:45.091
I'm sure I will.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.474
Where have you been?

23:46.634 --> 23:48.181
The plane leaves in an hour,
I've been banging on your door.

23:48.344 --> 23:49.220
We went for a walk.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.763
Are you okay? Hangover?

23:50.930 --> 23:53.854
Yeah... no, it's half champagne,
half elbow.

23:54.016 --> 23:55.359
(Mae laughs)

23:55.517 --> 23:57.611
Harry, I must apologize

23:57.770 --> 23:59.147
for my atrocious behavior
last night.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.236
Mae tells me it was
self-defense.

24:01.398 --> 24:02.194
No harm done.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.530
Try telling that
to my head.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.319
My apologies, Frank.

24:05.486 --> 24:08.581
Immense fun last night, Harry.

24:08.739 --> 24:12.289
We can't stop,
Beaconsfield awaits!

24:12.451 --> 24:14.795
Oh, yes-- oh, good luck.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.672
Are you going to wear
the feathers or the fruit?

24:16.830 --> 24:19.333
I was going to wear my necklace
but it's ruined.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.717
I'll have it fixed.
No, Harry.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.595
Rosie will pay.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.973
I was a little lonesome
last night.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.933
I didn't want to cause
any more difficulties.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.770
Where did you go
last night?

24:35.933 --> 24:38.903
A little walk and talk,
some breakfast.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.196
Excuse me.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.699
All that remains is the bill.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.655
And are you
feeling better?

24:49.822 --> 24:52.746
Well, I don't know if I should
be ashamed or proud,

24:52.908 --> 24:55.252
but apparently this is
the largest bill

24:55.411 --> 24:56.754
that they've ever issued.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.585
I knew you could drink,
but come on!

24:58.747 --> 25:00.215
(laughter)

25:02.459 --> 25:05.838
I've invited prominent families
to attend today.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.383
They'll bring their children
and they'll make friends

25:08.549 --> 25:10.176
with the children
from the church.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.221
That way, perhaps lasting
friendships can be built

25:13.387 --> 25:16.607
and donations may
be more regular.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.609
You sound more and more
like your father.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.238
"Fairness and spirit stand us
all in good stead."

25:23.397 --> 25:27.243
Ah, Mr. Milne,
I'm Rosalie de Bolotoff,

25:27.401 --> 25:29.654
Mr. Selfridge's
eldest daughter.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.824
He's assured me he'll be back
in time to hear you read.

25:32.990 --> 25:36.665
You write a very persuasive
letter, Mrs. de Bolotoff.

25:36.827 --> 25:40.297
And Lord Wynnstay, is it true
you have a softer side?

25:40.456 --> 25:43.175
My secret is out.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.213
Christopher?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.427
What do you think?

25:58.098 --> 25:59.725
I like it, Father.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.860
It's very fine.

26:16.742 --> 26:20.121
Roger, do you have a moment?

26:20.287 --> 26:21.334
Yes, of course.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.345
Hello, Roger.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.560
I'll leave you to it.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.228
Oh, this was you, was it?

26:42.434 --> 26:43.981
Called her.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.441
Interfered.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.231
I had to do something.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.613
It's unforgivable, Arthur.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.423
I don't know what Arthur
told you,

27:12.589 --> 27:15.889
but whatever it was,
he crossed a line.

27:16.051 --> 27:16.927
He had to.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.596
He's your friend.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.641
Why didn't you contact me?

27:21.807 --> 27:24.811
And say what?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.482
Is there anything
that can be done?

27:29.648 --> 27:30.900
Have you seen other doctors?

27:31.066 --> 27:31.908
Josie...

27:32.067 --> 27:33.284
I know you.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.787
You'll take
the word of the first official

27:35.946 --> 27:38.825
at face value.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.834
You could see a specialist.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.119
Mr. Selfridge
could find you one?

27:42.286 --> 27:43.412
This is not
the chief's concern.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.126
There could be a treatment,
a procedure...

27:45.289 --> 27:47.883
Josie. Please.

27:49.543 --> 27:52.092
Does he even know?

27:54.131 --> 27:55.053
Oh...

27:58.594 --> 28:00.688
And what about the children?

28:00.846 --> 28:03.065
You haven't told them,
have you?

28:07.352 --> 28:09.446
I appreciate your visit,
really I do.

28:12.733 --> 28:15.828
Now if you'll forgive me,
I must get back to work.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.627
(elevator bell dings)

28:37.591 --> 28:39.013
Miss Mardle.

28:40.427 --> 28:43.021
Meryl!

28:43.180 --> 28:44.272
<i>My goodness.</i>

28:44.431 --> 28:46.229
How you've grown.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.940
Nineteen.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.400
Working in Fashion.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.281
Well, congratulations.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.989
I'm surprised your father
allowed you.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.404
He was always rather
against the idea

28:58.570 --> 28:59.822
of you working here.

28:59.988 --> 29:04.164
I've proved myself capable,
Miss Mardle.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.543
Things are well at home?

29:08.705 --> 29:10.582
Wonderful.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.719
The children are thriving,
happy at school,

29:13.877 --> 29:15.174
lots of friends...

29:15.337 --> 29:17.010
We have a system.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.549
We all muck in together.

29:18.715 --> 29:22.015
We're very close.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.895
Had to be.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.025
Are you here on business?

29:30.686 --> 29:33.485
Yes. Of a sort.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.570
Staying long?

29:35.732 --> 29:38.485
I don't know at
the moment, Meryl.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.952
Well, I won't keep you
if you need to get on.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.297
Welcome, welcome, children.

29:55.669 --> 29:56.591
Take a seat.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.346
Don't run!

29:58.505 --> 30:00.052
Take your time,
take your time, please.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.341
Welcome.

30:06.930 --> 30:10.059
We were expecting
the Dolly Sisters,

30:10.225 --> 30:11.818
not the Dolly Sister.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.732
Well, we were expecting a car.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.400
We usually get a car
for auditions.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.285
I'm sure they send

30:20.444 --> 30:22.993
golden chariots
for your casino shows.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.704
But this is the movies.

30:25.866 --> 30:27.743
Opportunities come;
and then they go.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.253
Well, they're the same.

30:30.412 --> 30:33.666
I mean, what Rosie does,
Jenny does.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.754
Where is she?

30:34.916 --> 30:36.668
(whispers):
I don't know.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.759
She said she was going home
to get changed.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.265
This is so humiliating.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.344
Do you mind?

30:48.847 --> 30:51.726
This isn't going to work.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.815
At least let her try.

30:56.772 --> 30:57.694
(whispering):
Good luck.

30:57.856 --> 30:58.698
Thank you.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.359
(Charleston music begins)

31:02.069 --> 31:03.161
(snaps fingers)

31:26.593 --> 31:27.560
(elevator bell dings)

31:29.096 --> 31:30.439
Miss Mardle?

31:30.597 --> 31:31.439
Kitty!

31:31.598 --> 31:32.440
What a lovely surprise.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.021
What are you doing here?

31:34.184 --> 31:35.356
Business.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.691
But I couldn't resist
a quick inspection

31:36.853 --> 31:37.900
of the old neighborhood.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.189
Aw, the "old neighborhood."

31:39.356 --> 31:40.528
Listen to you!

31:40.690 --> 31:41.987
Have you got time
for a cup of tea?

31:42.150 --> 31:43.743
Yes.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.993
What's it like over there?

31:47.155 --> 31:48.498
Do you think I'd like it?

31:48.657 --> 31:50.159
Oh, New York was made
for you, Kitty.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.498
Really?

31:53.954 --> 31:56.377
They have a certain way
over there.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.463
People know where
they want to go in their life

31:58.625 --> 32:00.753
and they seek it out
with all their heart.

32:00.919 --> 32:01.886
They don't feel shame,

32:02.045 --> 32:04.343
they don't feel embarrassed.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.803
People respect that.

32:05.966 --> 32:08.344
They call it moxie.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.557
(chuckles softly)

32:10.971 --> 32:12.188
What a funny word.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.850
Have you seen Mr. Grove?

32:15.016 --> 32:18.896
Briefly, yes.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.156
Still sore?

32:25.652 --> 32:28.747
They still talk about you
in the store.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.875
New girls on their first days

32:32.033 --> 32:36.584
learn about the legendary
Miss Mardle.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.965
If anyone's got moxie, it's you.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.627
That's very kind of you.

32:44.379 --> 32:45.972
But if life's taught me anything

32:46.131 --> 32:50.011
it's that work is not
the be all and end all.

32:50.177 --> 32:51.724
Wish I'd learned that earlier.

32:54.264 --> 32:59.270
Well, there's always time
to change one's priorities,

32:59.436 --> 33:01.609
don't you think?

33:10.489 --> 33:16.997
"It just shows what can be done
by taking a little trouble,"

33:17.162 --> 33:18.505
<i>said Eeyore.</i>

33:18.663 --> 33:21.291
"Do you see, Pooh?

33:21.458 --> 33:23.256
"Do you see, Piglet?

33:23.418 --> 33:29.221
"Brains first, then Hard Work.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.350
"Look at it!

33:31.510 --> 33:37.438
That's the way to build a
house," said Eeyore proudly.

33:37.599 --> 33:40.694
So they left him in it.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.149
And Christopher Robin went
back to lunch

33:42.312 --> 33:46.158
with his friends Pooh and Piglet

33:46.316 --> 33:50.321
and on the way they told him of
the Awful Mistake they had made.

33:50.487 --> 33:53.411
And when he had finished
laughing,

33:53.573 --> 33:56.543
they all sang the Outdoor Song
for Snowy Weather

33:56.701 --> 33:58.078
the rest of the way home.

33:58.245 --> 34:02.000
Piglet, who was still not quite
sure of his voice,

34:02.165 --> 34:05.465
putting in the tiddely-poms
again.

34:05.627 --> 34:10.224
"And I know it seems easy,"
said Piglet to himself,

34:10.382 --> 34:12.976
"but it isn't everyone
who could do it."

34:21.810 --> 34:24.313
Mr. Milne, thank you.

34:24.478 --> 34:27.107
Your stories remind us
of our innocence.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.900
Thank you,
Mr. Selfridge.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.784
Come on.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.246
Gordon.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.784
How have things been going?

34:36.949 --> 34:38.748
As you would expect.

34:38.909 --> 34:42.335
GRACE: I hear France was a success, Mr.
Selfridge.

34:42.496 --> 34:45.000
You're always magnificent
at those events.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.090
Well, I'm sorry that Gordon
couldn't make it.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.005
We'll always remember today,
won't we, Ralph?

34:50.170 --> 34:51.138
That's what matters.

34:52.674 --> 34:54.972
We'll be having supper

34:55.135 --> 34:56.681
at the Criterion
before heading home.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.688
You're welcome to join us.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.602
I... I should return
home myself.

35:03.768 --> 35:04.985
It's been a long
couple of days.

35:05.145 --> 35:06.738
Of course.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.739
Come on then, bye-bye.

35:18.658 --> 35:19.910
I got something for you.

35:20.076 --> 35:21.623
Mmm.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.663
<i>The New Yorker.</i>

35:23.830 --> 35:25.628
Elizabeth reads it.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.760
I don't get all the jokes
but she thinks it's a scream.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.716
I've heard good things.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.005
I'll give it
a read tomorrow.

35:32.172 --> 35:33.549
Thank you.

35:33.715 --> 35:36.764
Oh!

35:36.926 --> 35:41.181
That was a long
couple of days.

35:41.348 --> 35:44.192
I missed you.

35:44.351 --> 35:45.898
I missed you too.

35:46.061 --> 35:51.363
I used to enjoy getting away,
seeing things, but...

35:51.524 --> 35:55.449
This time there was
an emptiness to it.

35:58.198 --> 36:03.125
It made me realize
that true joy lies

36:03.286 --> 36:07.541
in hearth and home.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.175
You mean the world
to me, Kitty.

36:12.170 --> 36:16.846
It sounds like you've
been doing some thinking.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.352
I have, yes.

36:19.511 --> 36:23.186
Perhaps we were
a little hasty

36:23.348 --> 36:25.601
dismissing the idea
of children.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.067
What?

36:30.230 --> 36:31.231
(laughing)

36:35.110 --> 36:37.112
You were dead
against it before.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.406
I just, I feel we've
been running around

36:39.572 --> 36:41.950
the whole time,
looking for something

36:42.117 --> 36:45.917
and maybe we've
already got it.

36:46.079 --> 36:50.926
Maybe we could make it
even stronger.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.813
You have a visitor, sir.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.691
Mrs. de Bolotoff left him
in the living room.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.227
Thank you, Fraser.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.442
Mr. D'Ancona came
to see me.

37:15.608 --> 37:19.329
Wanted me to remind you of
certain outstanding matters.

37:19.487 --> 37:20.704
Are you in his employ now?

37:20.864 --> 37:21.990
Certainly not.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.830
Then I suggest you keep
your nose out of my business.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.619
You'd be a fool to ignore him.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.162
It's in hand.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.205
I've been to the bank,
I have a draft.

37:29.372 --> 37:30.794
He'd take a check.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.925
Unless there weren't
the funds to honor it.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.179
I'm one of the wealthiest
men in London.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.805
Do you really think

37:37.964 --> 37:39.932
that I can't afford to pay
a gambling debt?

37:40.091 --> 37:41.308
Mr. Selfridge.

37:41.468 --> 37:42.890
Harry.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.599
I'm just passing on
a message.

37:55.482 --> 37:59.032
Mr. D'Ancona, Harry Selfridge.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.492
I have something for you.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.658
Meet me at my club at,
say, 11:00?

38:04.824 --> 38:05.916
Thank you.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.346
Can you read it now?

38:22.509 --> 38:24.807
Wash and change first.

38:24.969 --> 38:25.970
Go on.

38:28.598 --> 38:30.316
(knock at door)

38:30.475 --> 38:33.274
All right, Mrs. Green,
I've got it.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.906
Things have changed in here.

38:52.372 --> 38:55.125
Time can't stand still.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.217
Sometimes I wish it had.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.388
You know, I find it
almost amusing

39:04.551 --> 39:06.599
that the prospect of death has
made the heart grow fonder.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.809
Oh, Roger.

39:08.972 --> 39:10.724
You always knew how
to go for the jugular.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.689
What did you imagine was going
to happen?

39:13.852 --> 39:15.854
That you wander back in here
with your magic wand

39:16.020 --> 39:16.987
and make everything better?

39:17.146 --> 39:18.398
No.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.363
I just want to help.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.903
Well, you can't.

39:23.069 --> 39:25.197
It's too late.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.330
You left.

39:26.489 --> 39:27.456
You walked away from me.

39:27.615 --> 39:28.741
Do you really think
railing against me

39:28.908 --> 39:30.034
changes what's happening
to you?

39:30.201 --> 39:31.748
I have no desire
to go over old ground.

39:31.911 --> 39:32.753
I'm tired.

39:32.912 --> 39:35.040
Well, I'm stubborn.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.256
And I will not
leave you again.

39:41.546 --> 39:44.345
Josie, can't you understand?

39:44.507 --> 39:48.262
I don't want you
to see me diminish.

39:48.428 --> 39:50.055
(tearfully): You'll never
diminish in my eyes.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.940
I will.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.100
I will.

39:54.267 --> 39:56.941
I'll wither and I'll die.

39:57.103 --> 39:59.822
MERYL:
What are you talking about?

40:07.196 --> 40:09.073
I'll be at the King's Hotel.

40:24.881 --> 40:27.600
(crying):
It's not true... is it?

40:27.759 --> 40:30.638
I'm afraid it is.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.306
I have cancer, Meryl.

40:33.473 --> 40:36.568
It's in my lungs and my liver

40:36.726 --> 40:39.275
and there isn't anything
that can be done.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.565
(sobbing)

40:44.400 --> 40:46.698
You're lying!

40:46.861 --> 40:49.364
It isn't true!

40:49.530 --> 40:51.578
I'm so sorry.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.789
I don't know
what else I can say.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.132
No!

41:08.675 --> 41:10.348
(doorbell rings)

41:12.971 --> 41:15.144
Who's calling at this hour?

41:15.306 --> 41:17.400
I'll see to it,
Mrs. de Bolotoff.

41:19.936 --> 41:22.815
WYNNSTAY: I need to talk to Mrs.
de Bolotofi'.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.325
Who is it, Fraser?

41:25.483 --> 41:26.359
Lord Wynnstay.

41:26.526 --> 41:27.743
What are you doing here?

41:27.902 --> 41:29.495
Is everything okay?

41:29.654 --> 41:30.951
I've been
to the presses.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.411
I tried to stop them.

41:32.573 --> 41:33.870
It's too late.

41:34.033 --> 41:34.955
What is it?

41:42.959 --> 41:47.214
Please, please do not think
that I sanctioned this.

41:48.506 --> 41:49.473
Please leave.

41:51.592 --> 41:53.094
I can stay and speak to Harry.

41:53.261 --> 41:56.105
Please... just go.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.450
Why so glum, chum?

42:14.657 --> 42:16.034
Congratulations
on the movie.

42:16.200 --> 42:20.330
Couldn't have done it
without you.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.248
I don't know...

42:22.415 --> 42:26.636
There's something "forever"
about the pictures, isn't there?

42:26.794 --> 42:29.217
You never grow old
on the silver screen.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.263
I'll be right back.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.988
You've got her all excited.

42:45.146 --> 42:46.614
They won't let you down.

42:46.773 --> 42:49.697
One of our investors
has pulled out and...

42:49.859 --> 42:51.361
it looks like
it won't be happening.

42:51.527 --> 42:52.904
I'm sorry to hear that.

42:53.071 --> 42:54.118
Yes.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.372
It was going to be
quite a picture.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.158
We were going
to approach you

42:57.325 --> 43:01.000
to shoot some scenes
in the store.

43:01.162 --> 43:03.335
Well, I'll let Rosie know
in the morning.

43:03.498 --> 43:04.966
No point ruining her night.

43:05.124 --> 43:06.876
Oswald?

43:07.043 --> 43:09.341
What type of figure are we
talking about for this movie?

43:09.504 --> 43:12.758
In the region of 50,000.

43:21.808 --> 43:22.980
A telephone call,
Mr. Selfridge.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.234
Thank you.

43:26.813 --> 43:29.566
My God... are you serious?

43:29.732 --> 43:32.952
She earned her shot.

43:33.111 --> 43:34.579
Let her have it.

43:34.737 --> 43:35.613
(stammering)

43:35.780 --> 43:36.781
Thank you.

43:39.117 --> 43:40.118
Thank you.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.205
Hello?

43:44.372 --> 43:45.919
Rosalie.

43:46.082 --> 43:47.880
Slow... slow down, honey!

43:48.042 --> 43:51.012
A hotel filled with journalists
and you didn't hear about this?!

43:51.170 --> 43:52.638
What are you
talking about?

43:52.797 --> 43:56.347
The Herald has printed
a column of despicable lies.

43:56.509 --> 43:58.056
This is tittle-tattle.

43:58.219 --> 43:59.266
This'll blow over.

43:59.428 --> 44:00.771
My family means
everything to me

44:00.930 --> 44:02.682
and I will not have
their names smeared.

44:02.849 --> 44:05.193
Tomorrow in the office
I want you to cancel

44:05.351 --> 44:06.568
every single ad in this paper.

44:06.727 --> 44:07.853
Oh, but Harry,
sleep on it.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.272
That's an overreaction.

44:09.438 --> 44:10.564
I'm supposed to take
advice from you?

44:10.731 --> 44:11.573
What does that mean?

44:11.732 --> 44:13.575
You know, you may own
dozens of stores

44:13.734 --> 44:15.156
but you don't own the press,
and neither do I.

44:15.319 --> 44:17.321
If you want the adulation,
you have to take the jeers.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.705
This could have
been controlled.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.412
You took your eye
off the ball.

44:20.575 --> 44:22.543
I worked my fingers to the bone
in France and what did I get?

44:22.702 --> 44:23.874
An elbow
on the head and...?

44:24.036 --> 44:25.208
You got a lot more
than that, Frank.

44:25.371 --> 44:27.624
You were with the woman
that wrote this that night

44:27.790 --> 44:29.713
and the next morning--
did you sleep with her?

44:29.876 --> 44:31.549
Is this her revenge?

44:31.711 --> 44:34.055
Get out! Get out!

44:34.213 --> 44:36.466
We'll talk about it
in the light of day.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.264
(door closes)

44:42.638 --> 44:43.855
You must be mistaken.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.187
He called.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.101
I'm sorry, sir.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.565
Show me to his table.

45:56.504 --> 45:59.053
