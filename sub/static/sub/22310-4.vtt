00:01.627 --> 00:03.252
<i>- Last year,
a competition was created</i>

00:03.295 --> 00:05.754
<i>to test the nation's
best bladesmiths.</i>

00:05.798 --> 00:08.048
<i>Thousands responded,
and this year,</i>

00:08.092 --> 00:09.925
<i>craftsmen
from all over the country</i>

00:09.969 --> 00:12.261
<i>and all walks of life
have come forward</i>

00:12.304 --> 00:13.887
<i>for their chance
to claim the title.</i>

00:13.931 --> 00:15.848
- I'm gonna be the next
"Forged In Fire" champion.

00:15.891 --> 00:17.141
- I want to win!

00:17.184 --> 00:18.642
- It would be
a life-changing moment.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.144
- Welcome to the Forge.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.438
<i>Now, the Forge
returns with challenges</i>

00:22.481 --> 00:24.982
<i>unlike anything
ever seen before.</i>

00:25.026 --> 00:26.775
- You'll be using this.

00:26.819 --> 00:29.945
<i>- Skill and ingenuity
will be pushed to the limit.</i>

00:29.989 --> 00:32.114
<i>Some will rise to the challenge.</i>

00:32.158 --> 00:34.783
<i>Some will fall,
but only the best</i>

00:34.827 --> 00:37.286
<i>will be crowned
"Forged In Fire" champions</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:39.580
<i>and take home $10,000.</i>

00:39.623 --> 00:42.583
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:42.626 --> 00:49.173
¶ ¶

00:49.216 --> 00:50.632
<i>- My name is Michael Coffey.</i>

00:50.676 --> 00:53.427
I am a custom
metal-working fabricator.

00:53.471 --> 00:55.679
I really love being able
to have a picture in my mind

00:55.723 --> 00:56.972
of an item I'd love to create

00:57.016 --> 00:59.391
and then seeing that
come into being.

00:59.435 --> 01:00.934
<i>- My name is Tim Hinsela.</i>

01:00.978 --> 01:05.147
I work for myself,
and have for the last 27 years.

01:05.191 --> 01:07.983
I made my first full suit
of plate armor when I was 14,

01:08.027 --> 01:09.485
and it was terrible.

01:09.528 --> 01:10.986
And, no, I'm not
showing you a picture.

01:11.030 --> 01:14.656
But I fell in love
with the art of the sword.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.200
- My name is Alexei Afiliya.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.202
I was born in Russia,
moved to the United States

01:18.245 --> 01:20.037
about 12 years ago.

01:20.081 --> 01:23.248
I got into making armor first,
but when you work alongside

01:23.292 --> 01:24.833
with a whole bunch
of bladesmiths,

01:24.877 --> 01:27.002
you start making blades
of your own.

01:27.046 --> 01:28.670
<i>- My name is John Gruber.</i>

01:28.714 --> 01:30.964
Metal has always
been my first love.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.674
Any woman that came into my life

01:32.718 --> 01:35.094
that wanted me to spend less
time with my metal,

01:35.137 --> 01:36.762
was the first thing to go.

01:36.806 --> 01:38.514
¶ ¶

01:38.557 --> 01:41.183
- Bladesmiths.
Welcome to the Forge.

01:41.227 --> 01:44.061
You are here to engage in
three rounds of competition,

01:44.105 --> 01:47.356
specifically designed to test
every aspect of your

01:47.399 --> 01:49.566
edged weapons-making
capabilities.

01:49.610 --> 01:53.362
From design, to forging,
to fit and finish.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.739
After each round,
you will hand your work over

01:55.783 --> 01:57.741
to our panel of expert judges.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.994
American Bladesmith Society
Mastersmith, J. Neilson.

02:01.038 --> 02:04.414
Historic weapons recreation
specialist, David Baker.

02:04.458 --> 02:08.043
Edged weapons specialist,
Doug Marcaida.

02:08.087 --> 02:09.837
Ultimately,
they will decide which of you

02:09.880 --> 02:11.296
is the
"Forged in Fire" champion,

02:11.340 --> 02:14.716
and receives
a check for $10,000.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.552
In your first round of
competition,

02:16.595 --> 02:17.803
you'll be using...

02:17.847 --> 02:20.305
¶ ¶

02:20.349 --> 02:21.890
These.

02:21.934 --> 02:25.060
Everyday common metal items.

02:25.104 --> 02:27.479
- Oh my God, none of this
wants to go together.

02:27.523 --> 02:30.232
There's all sorts of weird
blades and railroad spikes

02:30.276 --> 02:32.359
and pieces of chain...
It's just, it's crazy.

02:32.403 --> 02:36.405
- Your challenge in the first
round is to take three or more

02:36.448 --> 02:40.242
<i>of these metals and forge them
into a signature blade</i>

02:40.286 --> 02:42.119
<i>of your own design.</i>

02:42.163 --> 02:44.705
<i>- This is gonna be a crazy
challenge, that's for sure.</i>

02:44.748 --> 02:47.499
I don't even know what I'm gonna
be able to make with this stuff,

02:47.543 --> 02:49.293
so we'll see.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.919
- The blades themselves
must fall within

02:50.963 --> 02:52.796
the following parameters:

02:52.840 --> 02:54.965
<i>the length of the blade,
not including the tang,</i>

02:55.009 --> 02:58.468
<i>must be between
14 and 16 inches.</i>

02:58.512 --> 03:00.095
<i>The overall length
of your weapon</i>

03:00.139 --> 03:02.764
<i>must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

03:02.808 --> 03:04.474
Keep in mind that, in round two,

03:04.518 --> 03:07.144
you'll also have to fabricate
and attach a handle

03:07.188 --> 03:10.105
to your blades, turning them
into fully-functional weapons,

03:10.149 --> 03:12.441
which will then be tested
in a coconut chop...

03:12.484 --> 03:13.692
¶ ¶

03:13.736 --> 03:15.319
and slicing through a phonebook.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.321
¶ ¶

03:17.364 --> 03:19.615
You'll have ten minutes
to work on your design.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.618
You'll have three hours
to forge your blades.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.328
Your time starts now.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.954
¶ ¶

03:25.998 --> 03:28.332
- Curious to see the different
materials they got,

03:28.375 --> 03:30.792
how they're gonna
incorporate them together.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.253
- I see some kind of
a sickle-looking blade

03:33.297 --> 03:34.630
<i>and a shovel.</i>

03:34.673 --> 03:36.298
<i>There's a shovel on the table.</i>

03:36.342 --> 03:38.008
Who makes knives
with this stuff?

03:38.052 --> 03:40.052
This is what you
throw away at a garage sale.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.970
¶ ¶

03:42.014 --> 03:44.306
<i>- It's all good material.
- That's the key.</i>

03:44.350 --> 03:46.141
They should know
what steels are,

03:46.185 --> 03:47.893
what the materials
are basically made of.

03:47.937 --> 03:49.770
¶ ¶

03:49.813 --> 03:52.981
<i>- So I grab the lawnmower blade
with cylindrical bearings,</i>

03:53.025 --> 03:54.650
and I grab the rasp.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.818
<i>The knife I'm making today
is a "kruchete."</i>

03:56.862 --> 03:58.820
<i>It's a kukri/machete hybrid.</i>

03:58.864 --> 04:01.657
<i>They told us that we got a
coconut and a telephone book.</i>

04:01.700 --> 04:04.826
It's the best shape,
in my head, to do the job.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.829
What's really gonna pull me
through is my artistic eye.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.289
<i>I am a good blacksmith.</i>

04:09.333 --> 04:11.166
I can move material
where I need it to go.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.334
Let's see.

04:12.378 --> 04:13.919
- I'm going to try with a saw.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.837
I don't know how
it's gonna happen.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.423
- Ilya's grabbed
all three saw blades.

04:18.467 --> 04:21.718
He's grabbed the chainsaw blade;
he's grabbed the farrier's rasp.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.429
- I pick the three steels
on the basis of

04:24.473 --> 04:26.098
first, I know what it is.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.684
Second,
I kind of know what it is.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.062
And third, the shape
satisfies my purpose.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.397
This is some nice pencils.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.232
<i>I'm making modern kukri.</i>

04:35.276 --> 04:36.858
<i>I don't know if I have an ego.</i>

04:36.902 --> 04:40.112
I don't know another
way of being me

04:40.155 --> 04:43.073
besides how I am right now,
so I have no measurement

04:43.117 --> 04:44.449
outside of what I am.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.034
¶ ¶

04:46.078 --> 04:48.120
<i>- Mike's got some rebar,
a pry bar,</i>

04:48.163 --> 04:50.289
<i>and a farrier's rasp.</i>

04:50.332 --> 04:53.875
<i>- The blade I'm going for is
a machete-like object.</i>

04:53.919 --> 04:57.379
<i>It's not quite like a kukri
with a really steep dip,</i>

04:57.423 --> 04:59.047
but it's still got
that similar swell

04:59.091 --> 05:00.882
and just a slight drop
to the point.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.592
<i>I work at a shop called
Dragon's Breath Forge</i>

05:02.636 --> 05:04.219
<i>in Wolcott, Connecticut.</i>

05:04.263 --> 05:06.722
Each of my other three
shop mates competed and won

05:06.765 --> 05:08.390
their respective episodes
on season one,

05:08.434 --> 05:11.393
so I am here
to carry the torch home.

05:11.437 --> 05:13.117
No pressure.
[laughs]

05:13.147 --> 05:14.771
¶ ¶

05:14.815 --> 05:18.066
<i>- I grabbed three shears,
a shovel, a saw blade,</i>

05:18.110 --> 05:19.901
<i>and a couple of railroad spikes.</i>

05:19.945 --> 05:21.945
That's all that's left
that I could identify

05:21.989 --> 05:23.613
as useable material.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.907
<i>My signature blade is bowie.</i>

05:25.951 --> 05:28.618
<i>A bowie is a combat knife
from the 1800s.</i>

05:28.662 --> 05:31.288
<i>It was designed by
Jim Bowie and his brother.</i>

05:31.332 --> 05:34.791
I don't want to be cocky,
but my style is strong.

05:34.835 --> 05:39.129
I can implement my artistic
tastes into damn near anything.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.589
- Materials down, bladesmiths.

05:40.632 --> 05:44.134
Your ten minute
design period is now closed.

05:44.178 --> 05:48.013
<i>Your three hour
forge time starts... now.</i>

05:48.057 --> 05:50.098
<i>- This is gonna be tough.</i>

05:50.142 --> 05:52.934
<i>There are a number of different
wants to combine that material.</i>

05:52.978 --> 05:55.771
- This a 14 to 16 inch
blade on these knives.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.356
That's not a small knife.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.566
They need plenty of steel.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.776
- We'll see what happens.

06:00.819 --> 06:01.860
[fire roaring]

06:01.904 --> 06:03.403
<i>- That metal smells good.</i>

06:03.447 --> 06:05.280
<i>The first thing I do,</i>

06:05.324 --> 06:07.657
<i>I put the cylinder bearings
in the forge.</i>

06:07.701 --> 06:09.493
Those are gonna take
the longest amount of time

06:09.536 --> 06:10.660
to come up to heat.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.454
[saw whirring]

06:12.498 --> 06:15.457
I take my lawnmower blade,
I cut it into equal sections,

06:15.501 --> 06:19.294
and then I grind all the teeth
off of that rasp.

06:19.338 --> 06:22.631
<i>Once that is a nice, clean,
smooth piece of metal,</i>

06:22.674 --> 06:25.008
<i>then I cut that into
equal length pieces</i>

06:25.052 --> 06:27.010
<i>so they fit with
the lawnmower blade.</i>

06:27.054 --> 06:29.262
- Well, if you're gonna forge
well, that's what you want.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.516
You want it as smooth as
possible so they match up flush.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.477
That way you prevent any
of those gaps and inclusions.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.687
¶ ¶

06:37.731 --> 06:39.815
- It's all in the details.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.316
[machinery whirring]

06:41.360 --> 06:43.819
- I start off by
grinding down all of

06:43.862 --> 06:45.529
the teeth off the farrier's rasp

06:45.572 --> 06:48.073
<i>while I'm drawing down
and retaining the taper</i>

06:48.117 --> 06:50.659
<i>on the crow bar that I selected.</i>

06:50.702 --> 06:52.369
- Mike is trucking right along.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.996
He's done a lot of work
to that farrier's rasp.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.331
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:56.375 --> 06:57.707
- [bleep]

06:57.751 --> 06:59.543
- Oy yoy yoy.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.004
<i>- I'm doing my best to juggle
a few pieces at a time.</i>

07:03.048 --> 07:04.840
<i>I lose track of where
the edge of the belt is</i>

07:04.883 --> 07:07.342
and then bam, my thumb just
goes right forward into it.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.719
- There's medics on
the floor treating Mike.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.681
- Yeah, might as well.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.350
- If you can add DNA
to your blade, why not?

07:15.394 --> 07:17.602
[laughs]
- He can't help it.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.187
- It's making things
a bit sensitive.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.991
But that's just something
I got to deal with.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.024
Move on.

07:24.445 --> 07:27.863
If the pieces aren't shiny,
the weld don't take.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.198
<i>- Tim looks like he's getting
his stack put together.</i>

07:30.242 --> 07:31.992
[machinery whirring]

07:32.035 --> 07:33.702
- This is gonna be
a very physical,

07:33.745 --> 07:35.704
challenging competition.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.456
<i>Physically, I'm a train wreck.</i>

07:37.499 --> 07:39.624
I've broken myself
over the years

07:39.668 --> 07:41.668
because of the hard impacts
of swinging these

07:41.712 --> 07:45.380
large and small hammers all in
the course of the day.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.299
So why do we do this?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.176
[laughs]

07:49.219 --> 07:53.054
Imagine that zone that you can
will into existence

07:53.098 --> 07:54.723
with fire and muscle.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.892
[pounding]

07:56.935 --> 07:59.561
Rudyard Kipling said,
"Gold is for mistress,

07:59.605 --> 08:00.979
"silver for the maid.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.564
[fire roaring]

08:02.608 --> 08:04.733
"Copper for the craftsman,
cunning at his trade.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.276
[pounding]

08:06.320 --> 08:08.904
"'Good, ' said the Baron,
sitting in his hall.

08:08.947 --> 08:12.866
But iron, cold iron,
is the master of them all."

08:12.910 --> 08:15.744
¶ ¶

08:15.787 --> 08:17.579
Hell yeah!

08:17.623 --> 08:19.206
- Watch out.
Welding.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.584
¶ ¶

08:22.628 --> 08:25.420
- He's got about a 1/4 mile
of band saw blade over there.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.923
And he's trying to use
all of it,

08:27.966 --> 08:31.468
as opposed to doing
one wrap and moving on.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.261
<i>- It's a steaming hot mess.</i>

08:33.305 --> 08:34.804
All: [laughing]

08:34.848 --> 08:37.599
It's literally
a steaming hot mess over there.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.476
<i>- With this specific
architecture,</i>

08:39.520 --> 08:41.603
<i>I have to gently tap it together</i>

08:41.647 --> 08:43.230
before the whole piece
can be heated up

08:43.273 --> 08:45.106
to welding temperature.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.484
- The problem is, is he's
creating all of these pockets

08:47.528 --> 08:50.111
of nothing inside there.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.614
<i>- It might look like
a nightmare at first,</i>

08:52.658 --> 08:55.784
but trust me; it will be
perfectly fine in the end.

08:55.827 --> 08:56.952
- Two hours!

08:56.995 --> 08:59.829
You have two hours remaining!

08:59.873 --> 09:02.791
¶ ¶

09:02.834 --> 09:05.043
- There it is.
Now you make a blade.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.503
<i>- John seems to be
doing a great job.</i>

09:06.547 --> 09:08.171
- Yeah, he's got his billet.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.174
He needs to work on start
drawing that steel out.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.260
Oh!

09:13.303 --> 09:16.012
<i>Oh!
The heartbreak!</i>

09:16.056 --> 09:18.807
<i>- As I'm working the billet
through the press,</i>

09:18.850 --> 09:20.809
Donald Duck opens his mouth.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.978
<i>It just separates.</i>

09:23.021 --> 09:24.688
Son of a motherless goat.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.982
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.858
Mm, man!

09:28.902 --> 09:31.027
Still not sticking.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.321
- That's unfortunate.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.323
<i>- My heart drops for a second.</i>

09:35.367 --> 09:37.659
But I think,
"Keep moving forward."

09:37.703 --> 09:39.911
I'm gonna get these pieces
to stick, man.

09:39.955 --> 09:43.832
¶ ¶

09:43.875 --> 09:46.084
- Ilya has poured water
on his anvil;

09:46.128 --> 09:47.669
he's poured water on his hammer.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.379
What is that?

09:49.423 --> 09:51.923
- The water technique
is meant to blow the scale

09:51.967 --> 09:54.759
off of the surface
of that billet.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.554
- When I pull this out,
you have to take a step back,

09:57.598 --> 09:59.556
and you have to take
a step back.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.516
I gave the warning, right?
You heard?

10:01.560 --> 10:02.851
All right, no liability.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.603
- Watch this.
This'll be interesting.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.564
¶ ¶

10:07.608 --> 10:09.065
[pounding]

10:09.109 --> 10:10.709
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

10:13.905 --> 10:15.530
<i>¶ ¶</i>

10:15.574 --> 10:18.116
- When I pull this out,
you have to take a step back,

10:18.160 --> 10:19.909
and you have to take
a step back.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.369
I gave the warning.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.038
- Watch this.
This'll be interesting.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.914
<i>¶ ¶</i>

10:24.958 --> 10:26.416
[explosion]

10:26.460 --> 10:28.126
- Whoa! That scared
the [bleep] out of me.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.711
- Water forging.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.046
[pounding]

10:31.089 --> 10:32.672
<i>- Is that good thing?
- No.</i>

10:32.716 --> 10:34.382
No, it's not
a good thing at all.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.886
<i>- And the loud pop are actually
occlusions, or bubbles,</i>

10:37.929 --> 10:39.220
<i>inside the metal.</i>

10:39.264 --> 10:40.639
And if we were
to cut it right now,

10:40.682 --> 10:43.224
we would see pockets
of bad things.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.352
- So he's got steel bubble wrap
on the end of that stick,

10:45.395 --> 10:46.353
is what you're telling me?

10:46.396 --> 10:47.396
- You got it.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.064
- I warned everybody, okay?

10:49.107 --> 10:50.899
- Bladesmiths!

10:50.942 --> 10:54.069
You have 30 minutes remaining!

10:54.112 --> 10:56.279
<i>¶ ¶</i>

10:56.323 --> 10:58.990
Mike has really been
making some progress.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.408
<i>¶ ¶</i>

11:00.452 --> 11:01.951
- Mike's hitting
the weld nice and easy.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.244
Nice, easy hammer blows.
- Yup.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.663
- Starting on one end...
- Up and back.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.622
Up and back, up and back.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.082
- Now he's got it set;

11:07.125 --> 11:08.583
now he's gonna go
right to the press.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.085
That's smart.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.128
- I'm finally getting
the desired length

11:12.172 --> 11:14.255
that I was really hoping
to get out of this thing.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.424
<i>- Mike's got a nice shape
over there.</i>

11:16.468 --> 11:17.759
- It'll take
quite a bit of loving

11:17.803 --> 11:19.469
and quite a bit
of time at the grinder.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.513
But I think, uh,
my piece is definitely

11:21.556 --> 11:22.681
gonna perform quite well.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.557
<i>¶ ¶</i>

11:24.601 --> 11:26.101
- My arm is shot.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.396
My arm begins to hurt.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.440
<i>So I have developed
some pretty nasty tendinitis</i>

11:32.484 --> 11:35.276
and [bleep] hurts today, okay?

11:35.320 --> 11:38.988
And I have to swing like a mean
monster with this hammer,

11:39.032 --> 11:41.449
and it's...
It's not going well.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.201
[bleep]

11:43.245 --> 11:46.204
- It hurts to watch if
somebody's... is working so hard

11:46.248 --> 11:48.581
and just nothing's
working for him.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.125
- Well, as much pain
as I'm in right now,

11:50.168 --> 11:51.459
I'm not a quitter.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.962
I'm gonna keep...
Keep moving forward.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.755
Screw these guys.

11:55.799 --> 11:56.840
- Bladesmiths!

11:56.883 --> 11:59.175
You have 20 minutes remaining!

11:59.219 --> 12:00.677
¶ ¶

12:00.721 --> 12:02.512
[machinery whirring]

12:02.556 --> 12:04.764
- I have to say it,
Ilya's blade shape

12:04.808 --> 12:06.975
is really coming along.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.351
It looks like
he has just quenched.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.978
It looks like Ilya has quenched.
- Yeah.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.021
¶ ¶

12:12.065 --> 12:14.983
- As I'm going to the grinder,
I'm getting as much work done

12:15.026 --> 12:16.901
in as little time as possible.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.028
<i>¶ ¶</i>

12:19.072 --> 12:21.573
<i>- I'm looking at Tim's blade
and it's long and skinny.</i>

12:21.616 --> 12:23.533
- I... he's quenching.
- But it might make the grade.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.535
- Quench it.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.663
- Looks like John got his metal
to stick.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.206
- No, no, no!
- J., you...

12:30.250 --> 12:32.917
- Ah!
Horrible, horrible, horrible.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.711
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

12:34.755 --> 12:37.338
I am disappointed that I'm not
gonna finish a blade.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.549
<i>¶ ¶</i>

12:39.593 --> 12:43.887
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

12:43.930 --> 12:48.892
five, four, three, two, one.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.102
Bladesmiths!
Stop your works!

12:51.146 --> 12:52.604
Drop your tools!

12:52.647 --> 12:54.397
<i>- I am not happy with my weapon.</i>

12:54.441 --> 12:55.648
<i>It is what it is.</i>

12:55.692 --> 12:57.525
By the end of it,
I just tried to,

12:57.569 --> 12:59.110
you know, make something.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.862
<i>- I didn't make a weapon at all.</i>

13:00.906 --> 13:02.238
I'm done.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.366
I do not have a finished
piece of anything.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.911
<i>¶ ¶</i>

13:07.954 --> 13:09.537
- Gentlemen.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.748
Your challenge in this first
round of competition

13:11.792 --> 13:14.709
was to use three pieces
of salvaged steel

13:14.753 --> 13:17.337
to forge a signature blade
of you own design.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.880
¶ ¶

13:18.924 --> 13:21.007
Ilya, please present
your weapon to the judges.

13:21.051 --> 13:23.134
¶ ¶

13:23.178 --> 13:24.719
<i>- I noticed while
you were forging,</i>

13:24.763 --> 13:26.721
<i>you were having some
delamination issues.</i>

13:26.765 --> 13:28.389
<i>And I see a lot of cracks.</i>

13:28.433 --> 13:30.308
Just a lot of spots I can
get my thumbnail into

13:30.352 --> 13:31.893
concerns me a bit.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.561
Thank you.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.730
- Well, I like the fact
that you had a design.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.398
You got there with your shape.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.234
<i>I am worried that,
while you were grinding,</i>

13:39.277 --> 13:42.278
<i>we could see those
delaminations happening.</i>

13:42.322 --> 13:44.781
But all in all, nicely done.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.575
- Mike, please present
your blade to the judges.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.160
<i>- Well, Mike,
you took a lot of prep time.</i>

13:49.204 --> 13:50.495
<i>- I did.</i>

13:50.539 --> 13:52.288
<i>- You got quite a bend
in this blade.</i>

13:52.332 --> 13:54.290
<i>- There were definitely some
straightness issues</i>

13:54.334 --> 13:56.084
<i>that could have been addressed,</i>

13:56.127 --> 13:58.753
but the clock was ticking
and I couldn't argue with that.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.756
- Well, Mike, your design here
is pleasing to the eye.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.425
I like the way
your blade's designed.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.261
<i>Being that a coconut is rounded,</i>

14:06.304 --> 14:08.555
anywhere in the edges here
should catch on that.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.598
Very good.
Thank you.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.099
- Thank you.

14:11.142 --> 14:14.269
- Tim, please present
your blade to the judges.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.437
<i>- Well, Tim,
you took a lot of prep time,</i>

14:16.481 --> 14:18.022
<i>which is usually a help.</i>

14:18.066 --> 14:19.774
What happened?

14:19.818 --> 14:22.652
- I have some health issues
that reared their ugly head.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.279
- Well, it may not
be what you wanted,

14:24.322 --> 14:25.363
but you brought us a blade.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.282
- Dave?

14:27.325 --> 14:29.284
- I don't know that there's
a smith who's been at it

14:29.327 --> 14:31.619
for a number of years who
hasn't had those days

14:31.663 --> 14:33.246
where the hand just
won't open anymore,

14:33.290 --> 14:36.291
so I'm feeling your pain.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.625
You didn't give up.

14:37.669 --> 14:38.793
You kept fighting to the end.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.794
That's great to see.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.796
<i>¶ ¶</i>

14:41.840 --> 14:44.632
- John, because you have no work
to present to our judges,

14:44.676 --> 14:46.134
they have nothing to critique.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.886
What happened out there?

14:47.929 --> 14:50.138
<i>- Forge welding did not take,
and by that time,</i>

14:50.181 --> 14:53.141
<i>I didn't have enough material
to actually extend the blade,</i>

14:53.184 --> 14:54.809
draw a blade out from that.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.145
- Jonathan, because you
failed to produce a blade

14:57.188 --> 15:00.064
for our judges, I must now
dismiss you from the Forge.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.691
Your blade did not make the cut.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.484
- Thank you very much.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.904
<i>Not having anything that looks
like a knife to present</i>

15:05.947 --> 15:07.655
<i>is very disappointing.</i>

15:07.699 --> 15:09.824
But at the same time,
I'm not gonna insult the judges

15:09.868 --> 15:13.494
by giving them a billet
without any shape or any form.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.331
Happy to see my kids,
but I would much rather

15:16.374 --> 15:18.166
not be going home this way.

15:18.209 --> 15:21.586
<i>¶ ¶</i>

15:21.630 --> 15:24.255
- All right, bladesmiths.
This is round two.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.758
Your challenge is to
take your tempered blades

15:26.801 --> 15:29.177
and turn them into
fully-functional weapons

15:29.220 --> 15:31.679
by fashioning a handle
out of the range of materials

15:31.723 --> 15:33.181
provided to you.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.058
You'll have three hours
for this challenge.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.977
You can use that time
to address any flaws or issues

15:38.021 --> 15:40.563
that have been
identified in your blades.

15:40.607 --> 15:44.859
Your finished blades will be
tested in a coconut chop,

15:44.903 --> 15:46.069
and a phonebook slice.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.695
¶ ¶

15:47.739 --> 15:50.198
Mind you, when the time is up,

15:50.241 --> 15:53.493
one of you must surrender his
weapon and leave the Forge.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.827
¶ ¶

15:54.871 --> 15:55.871
Good luck, bladesmiths.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.373
Your time starts...
now.

15:58.416 --> 16:03.211
<i>¶ ¶</i>

16:03.254 --> 16:06.214
<i>- I knew I wanted to go with
a set of wooden scales</i>

16:06.257 --> 16:08.132
<i>from the beginning.</i>

16:08.176 --> 16:10.343
<i>It appears to me to be
some type of burl,</i>

16:10.387 --> 16:12.971
<i>which has some just really
fantastic action inside of it.</i>

16:13.014 --> 16:14.555
¶ ¶

16:14.599 --> 16:16.224
<i>Yeah, it has a fairly
rugged feel to it,</i>

16:16.267 --> 16:17.934
<i>so I said,
"That's the one for me."</i>

16:17.978 --> 16:19.769
[machine squeaking]

16:19.813 --> 16:22.730
- I'm hearing that ugly sound
of burning drill bit.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.441
- The plan for my handle is
drill some holes in the tang

16:25.485 --> 16:28.069
to attach scales
using some brass pins.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.529
[machine squeaking]

16:29.572 --> 16:31.239
- So we know that
his blade has hardened.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.991
[laughter]

16:33.034 --> 16:34.826
- If I can't drill a hole
through the tang,

16:34.869 --> 16:35.910
I have to change my plan.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.495
[machine whirring]

16:37.539 --> 16:39.789
- Ah, that's a sound
that just hurts my ears.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.582
- I have to use the wrap.

16:41.626 --> 16:44.252
But the wrap holds
the scales in place.

16:44.295 --> 16:47.005
I found some cord that looks
like something in between

16:47.048 --> 16:50.174
shoelaces and dog leashes.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.509
They will suit me very well.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.511
<i>¶ ¶</i>

16:53.555 --> 16:55.763
- I'm actually liking
this blade more and more

16:55.807 --> 16:57.265
as I'm cleaning it up.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.058
It has a lot of character.

16:59.102 --> 17:02.770
I'm really styling this after
a gnomish great sword.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.648
You know,
for gnomes about that big.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.235
<i>Some little gnome barbarian can
come in and seize your yard.</i>

17:09.279 --> 17:12.989
Look out, your ankles are toast.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.616

about Tim's forearm.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.285
You can see he's cradling it.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.454
He's really favoring that arm.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.289
- My right arm is
killing me right now,

17:21.332 --> 17:23.458
and it feels like there's
an ice pick stuck in it,

17:23.501 --> 17:25.126
right to the bone.

17:25.170 --> 17:28.046

extreme amount of pain.

his handle scales
while his epoxy cures.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.492

18:26.731 --> 18:28.898
There is one portion
of one of the scales

18:28.942 --> 18:32.151
that starts to separate a bit,
so I get some more glue in there

18:32.195 --> 18:35.029

Now it's time to see how well
they perform under pressure.

First up, is the strength test.

21:17.277 --> 21:20.027
J.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.071

21:22.115 --> 21:23.948
I'm gonna take each
of your knives and attempt

21:23.992 --> 21:26.200
to slice through three
coconuts with them.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.202
It's not only gonna test
the structural integrity

21:28.246 --> 21:29.954
of your edge,
but the overall strength

21:29.998 --> 21:31.205

thought of doing</i>

21:37.588 --> 21:38.879

21:38.923 --> 21:40.256
Now I'm just holding my breath

21:58.651 --> 22:00.234
Still sharp.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.737
The only problem I have
is that handle has a tendency

22:02.780 --> 22:04.405
to want to roll a little bit.

That... that was the one
I thought it was gonna break on.

Didn't get through the second;
put heck of a crack in it.

We did lose pieces

You've also developed a bit

We did get some initial cut,
but it just wasn't enough

24:12.493 --> 24:14.034
to get all the way
through there.

24:14.078 --> 24:16.704
We're using the same part

24:17.999 --> 24:19.540
We did lose a little bit
of the edge,

24:19.584 --> 24:21.083

prevented you getting

24:21.127 --> 24:23.419
a really good bite

24:46.777 --> 24:48.569
- Well, Tim,
we got more of a mushing motion

24:48.613 --> 24:51.071
than a shearing motion
out of that.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.324
I mean, there is a bit
of an edge there,

24:53.367 --> 24:56.911
but, I mean, you've got
a very heavy convex on there.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.788
<i>That's more of a splitting edge
than a shearing edge.</i>

24:59.832 --> 25:01.632

You've got a good

25:38.204 --> 25:40.037
I did hear a little bit
of crunching.

25:40.081 --> 25:41.956
We got some of that
fracturing on the edge

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
and a few flat spots
from the coconut.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.763
So you were able to
bite in part of the way,

25:45.795 --> 25:47.711

to leave the Forge.

26:02.019 --> 26:04.019
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:04.063 --> 26:07.731
Tim, your blade
did not make the cut.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.567
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:09.610 --> 26:12.170
- Tim, you came into the second
challenge the definite underdog.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.321
But you had a good piece
of steel there.

26:14.365 --> 26:17.575
<i>It might've been small.
It doesn't matter.</i>

26:17.618 --> 26:20.035
<i>You didn't get an edge
on that metal.</i>

26:20.079 --> 26:21.912
And that's why
we have to let you go.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.205
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:23.249 --> 26:25.499
- Tim,
please surrender your weapon.

26:25.543 --> 26:27.585
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:27.628 --> 26:30.170
<i>- I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm not surprised.</i>

26:30.214 --> 26:33.674
<i>My esteemed colleagues
simply made better blades.</i>

26:33.718 --> 26:35.217
I'm not gonna go home and cry.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.386
Things could certainly
have gone a little better,

26:37.430 --> 26:40.639
but I feel rather blessed
that I've had

26:40.683 --> 26:42.016
the opportunity at all.

26:42.059 --> 26:45.436
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:45.479 --> 26:47.271
- Mike, Ilya.

26:47.315 --> 26:49.857
Congratulations, you've made it
through to the final round.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.610
You do well in this challenge,
one of you will be declared

26:52.653 --> 26:55.779
"Forged in Fire" champion
and receive a check for $10,000.

26:55.823 --> 26:57.489
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:57.533 --> 26:59.074
Now we're sending you home
where you will

26:59.118 --> 27:01.619
forge an iconic weapon
from history.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.121
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:04.165 --> 27:05.372
The spiked shield.

27:05.416 --> 27:08.000
- Oh, [bleep].

27:08.044 --> 27:10.085
<i>- Dating back
to prehistoric times,</i>

27:10.129 --> 27:12.546
<i>the shield is the oldest
form of protection.</i>

27:12.590 --> 27:14.423
<i>Designed to block attacks
from weapons like</i>

27:14.467 --> 27:17.426
<i>spears, swords, axes, or arrows.</i>

27:17.470 --> 27:19.219
<i>Over time,
they have varied greatly</i>

27:19.263 --> 27:20.929
<i>in size and construction,</i>

27:20.973 --> 27:24.350
<i>using material such as steel,
wood, animal hide,</i>

27:24.393 --> 27:26.226
<i>and even turtle shells.</i>

27:26.270 --> 27:28.270
<i>Used primarily
as a defense weapon,</i>

27:28.314 --> 27:30.814
<i>the shield can also
be used to attack</i>

27:30.858 --> 27:34.234
<i>by punching an opponent
with either its face or rim.</i>

27:34.278 --> 27:36.111
<i>Sometime around the Middle Ages,</i>

27:36.155 --> 27:38.906
<i>spikes were incorporated,
adding an extra level</i>

27:38.949 --> 27:40.824
<i>of brutality to its design.</i>

27:40.868 --> 27:43.577
<i>The long steel spike could
deliver deadly blows,</i>

27:43.621 --> 27:47.081
<i>oftentimes immediately
disemboweling the attacker.</i>

27:47.124 --> 27:49.249
<i>The most notable
spiked shields today</i>

27:49.293 --> 27:52.920
<i>can be seen in the popular
video game series, "Skyrim."</i>

27:52.963 --> 27:54.380
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:54.423 --> 27:57.257
Your challenge is to forge
a spiked shield,

27:57.301 --> 28:00.135
a concave weapon
used by infantry troops

28:00.179 --> 28:03.097
between 13 and 16th centuries.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.973
<i>- I'm very excited
to go into round three.</i>

28:05.017 --> 28:07.643
The most pride I have
in proceeding

28:07.687 --> 28:11.438
is having the opportunity
to show my armoring skills.

28:11.482 --> 28:12.773
<i>¶ ¶</i>

28:12.817 --> 28:14.483
- The shields themselves
must fall within

28:14.527 --> 28:16.235
the following perimeters:

28:16.278 --> 28:20.489
the diameter of the shield must
be between 23 and 25 inches.

28:20.533 --> 28:23.325
The shield must include
at least one center spike

28:23.369 --> 28:25.619
between five and seven inches.

28:25.663 --> 28:28.622
And the concave
of the shield must be between

28:28.666 --> 28:31.250
2 1/4 and 3 inches deep.

28:31.293 --> 28:32.960
<i>- I really enjoy doings shields,</i>

28:33.003 --> 28:34.795
<i>but I was not expecting
to have to do any sort of</i>

28:34.839 --> 28:37.131
spikes or weird crap like that.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.633
- You will have five days
at your home Forge.

28:39.677 --> 28:42.970
After the five days is up,
you will return to this Forge

28:43.013 --> 28:46.098
and present your shields
to our panel of judges,

28:46.142 --> 28:47.808
<i>who will then push them
to the limits</i>

28:47.852 --> 28:49.977
<i>in a series of strenuous tests.</i>

28:50.020 --> 28:51.770
Only after those
tests are complete,

28:51.814 --> 28:53.480
will one of you be
declared the champion

28:53.524 --> 28:55.899
and receive that check
for 10 grand.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.484
<i>¶ ¶</i>

28:57.528 --> 28:58.819
See you in five days.

28:58.863 --> 29:02.906
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:02.950 --> 29:05.951
<i>- I never assumed that I would
make it to the final challenge.</i>

29:05.995 --> 29:07.494
But here I am.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.371
<i>Now that I'm back
in my own Forge,</i>

29:09.415 --> 29:11.248
<i>I feel very excited.</i>

29:11.292 --> 29:13.333
<i>Shields require
the skills of an armorer.</i>

29:13.377 --> 29:15.836
So I do have an advantage
over blade-makers

29:15.880 --> 29:17.212
in completing this project.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.006
[metallic hammering]

29:19.049 --> 29:21.675
So I'm designing a shield
with an attached gauntlet.

29:21.719 --> 29:23.343
The gauntlet is a steel glove.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.846
So this covers the back
of the palm, the wrist,

29:25.890 --> 29:27.181
and partial forearm.

29:27.224 --> 29:29.349
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:29.393 --> 29:32.186
I fit the pieces together
and they kind of look like crap.

29:32.229 --> 29:34.188
<i>This is a major problem.</i>

29:34.231 --> 29:36.940
<i>The back of the palm does not
articulate downward properly.</i>

29:36.984 --> 29:38.525
I'm getting very frustrated.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.360
<i>At this rate,
it will take me way too long</i>

29:40.404 --> 29:41.945
<i>and I'm gonna be way too angry</i>

29:41.989 --> 29:43.614
to complete the shield
as I want.

29:43.657 --> 29:48.911
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:48.954 --> 29:51.038
<i>- I'm feeling pretty great
about being back at the shop.</i>

29:51.081 --> 29:53.874
I share a shop with three other
"Forged in Fire" winners.

29:53.918 --> 29:57.211
It's a bit of pressure,
but I'm pretty comfortable here.

29:57.254 --> 30:00.464
I've got the base
for my two halves.

30:00.508 --> 30:02.716
They'll get joined
down the center.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.719
And everything else is just
adding pretty from there on in.

30:05.763 --> 30:09.473
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:09.517 --> 30:11.237
Working with sheet metal
and defining forms,

30:11.268 --> 30:13.560
it always looks really ugly

30:13.604 --> 30:15.562
before it starts
to look at all good.

30:15.606 --> 30:17.397
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:17.441 --> 30:19.775
Sheet metal always moves in such
weird ways when you heat it

30:19.819 --> 30:22.444
that only really get exacerbated
every time I heat it,

30:22.488 --> 30:26.740
so I'm trying to figure out the
best way to mitigate that now.

30:26.784 --> 30:28.283
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:28.327 --> 30:29.952
Stop [bleep] with me.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.371
[metallic clanking]

30:32.414 --> 30:33.747
Right now,
it's not working for me.

30:33.791 --> 30:35.332
So [bleep] weird.

30:35.376 --> 30:37.251
I'm getting, uh,
pretty tired of wrestling with

30:37.294 --> 30:39.378
the shield halves,
so I'm gonna let those soften up

30:39.421 --> 30:41.922
in the kiln in preparation for
some cold work tomorrow.

30:41.966 --> 30:44.258
Then it'll be ready
for the morning.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.176
That's all I need.

30:46.220 --> 30:48.011
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:48.055 --> 30:49.655
<i>- Finally, I fixed
the articulation issue</i>

30:49.682 --> 30:51.306
<i>with the gauntlet.</i>

30:51.350 --> 30:53.600
The gauntlet cannot be
integrated into the shield.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.769
<i>After all the problems
that I had,</i>

30:55.813 --> 30:57.813
I'm feeling pretty good.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.439
<i>For the shape of the spike,
I used</i>

30:59.483 --> 31:03.569
the World War I bayonet
construction as my inspiration.

31:03.612 --> 31:06.530
I'm also going to position
blade-catchers.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.782
When the steel or any other
thrusting weapon

31:08.826 --> 31:10.409
<i>comes in,
they get caught underneath.</i>

31:10.452 --> 31:12.286
It's trapped.

31:12.329 --> 31:15.455
<i>It further improves
the durability of the shield.</i>

31:15.499 --> 31:17.958
<i>I've laid out all the pieces,
and I have to say,</i>

31:18.002 --> 31:19.209
this weapon rocks.

31:19.253 --> 31:20.794
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:20.838 --> 31:22.421
<i>But I'm not
out of the woods yet.</i>

31:22.464 --> 31:24.631
The heat treat on armor is one
of the hardest parts,

31:24.675 --> 31:26.800
because in the violent
process of the quench,

31:26.844 --> 31:30.137
your weapon can warp
beyond usability.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.639
I hope nothing goes wrong
in the process.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.975
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

31:35.019 --> 31:36.810
All right.

31:36.854 --> 31:39.021
Ah, [bleep].

31:39.064 --> 31:40.647
The quench went "eh."

31:40.691 --> 31:43.567
The shield developed somewhat of
a big warp in one area.

31:43.611 --> 31:44.693
That's not good.

31:44.737 --> 31:47.154
<i>A big warp where I bumped it.</i>

31:47.197 --> 31:49.323
I'm going to have
to find a way to fix it.

31:49.366 --> 31:53.869
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:53.913 --> 31:55.370
<i>- So day two is kicking off.</i>

31:55.414 --> 31:56.830
<i>I set the pieces
in the kiln last night</i>

31:56.874 --> 31:58.832
<i>to do a cycle of softening.</i>

31:58.876 --> 32:00.167
<i>Came in to
check them this morning,</i>

32:00.210 --> 32:02.586
and they had just sagged.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.630
<i>Things are looking pretty grim,
so I'm gonna have to</i>

32:04.673 --> 32:07.090
throw those aside
and start all over again.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.384
<i>The material I'm going with,
I got enough there</i>

32:09.428 --> 32:11.261
<i>to cut one full circle.</i>

32:11.305 --> 32:13.180
<i>So I don't need to [bleep]
around with two halves.</i>

32:13.223 --> 32:15.515
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:15.559 --> 32:18.018
[metallic clanging]

32:18.062 --> 32:19.519
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:19.563 --> 32:21.104
<i>So I spent a hell
of a lot of time</i>

32:21.148 --> 32:22.564
getting this thing
to the shape it's in now.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.399
I'm feeling pretty comfortable.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.444
And start biting material
for the edge.

32:27.488 --> 32:31.406
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:31.450 --> 32:33.533
<i>- So the major warp came out.</i>

32:33.577 --> 32:34.701
<i>Pretty happy.</i>

32:34.745 --> 32:36.536
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:36.580 --> 32:38.705
<i>Now I'm going to blacken
the shield, polish them,</i>

32:38.749 --> 32:40.374
<i>and assemble all the pieces.</i>

32:40.417 --> 32:42.292
I'm doing a two-color system.

32:42.336 --> 32:45.671
With the recesses being black
and the protruding parts

32:45.714 --> 32:47.506
being polished.

32:47.549 --> 32:50.050
As far as the final test goes,
I think my shield will put up

32:50.094 --> 32:52.469
a decent fight against
whatever they throw at it.

32:52.513 --> 32:55.013
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:55.057 --> 32:56.390
Oh, take a look.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.393
I think it's ready
for the judges.

32:58.435 --> 32:59.351
<i>- All right, uh, day five.</i>

32:59.395 --> 33:01.228
<i>The 11th hour.</i>

33:01.271 --> 33:03.563
<i>I've got the pieces essentially
prepped for assembly,</i>

33:03.607 --> 33:05.899
but just getting frustrated
with the alignment

33:05.943 --> 33:07.567
of all these pieces.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.152
Oh, my God,
I got to wrangle it again.

33:09.196 --> 33:12.406
This is the worst.
This is the [bleep] worst.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.241
Okay, I got to switch gears.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.742
This may or may not
come together.

33:15.786 --> 33:18.954
I got to get the strap.
I got to get the spikes.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.914
<i>I think I'm gonna forego
the additional spikes.</i>

33:20.958 --> 33:22.582
<i>Um, the one I have
in the center,</i>

33:22.626 --> 33:24.918
it'll be very sturdy
once I get it in place.

33:24.962 --> 33:26.420
[fire roaring]

33:26.463 --> 33:28.588
[thudding]

33:28.632 --> 33:30.590
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:30.634 --> 33:33.176
<i>About 20 minutes left
and I need to attach</i>

33:33.220 --> 33:34.803
<i>the handle and the strap.</i>

33:34.847 --> 33:37.097
[shouting]
Where's the [bleep] handle?

33:37.141 --> 33:38.974
The [bleep] epoxy didn't hold.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.978
<i>Everything is going wrong
right at the last minute</i>

33:41.020 --> 33:42.686
<i>when it really just
couldn't have.</i>

33:42.730 --> 33:44.771
Come on!

33:44.815 --> 33:45.939
[thudding]
[bleep]

33:45.983 --> 33:48.692
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:51.822 --> 33:53.822
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:53.866 --> 33:55.949
<i>- Everything is going wrong
right at the last minute.</i>

33:55.993 --> 33:57.117
[sighs]

33:57.161 --> 33:58.452
[laughs]

33:58.495 --> 34:00.120
Glad I started with the spike.

34:00.164 --> 34:02.456
[metallic hammering]

34:02.499 --> 34:05.959
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:06.003 --> 34:07.627
Oh.
It's done.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.087
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:09.131 --> 34:10.797
It's a shield.
It's got a spike.

34:10.841 --> 34:12.674
It's got a handle and a strap.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.302
<i>It matches all of
the minimum requirements.</i>

34:15.345 --> 34:16.970
It'll be able to be tested.

34:17.014 --> 34:18.722
<i>This can turn out just fine.</i>

34:18.766 --> 34:26.730
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:26.774 --> 34:28.940
- Gentlemen.
Welcome to the arena.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.859
To perform the types of tests
that we want to

34:30.903 --> 34:32.319
with your spike shields,

34:32.362 --> 34:34.571
we decided to leave the Forge
in lieu of a place

34:34.615 --> 34:36.823
a little bit more medieval.

34:36.867 --> 34:38.158
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:38.202 --> 34:40.160
Ilya, how'd it go
at your home Forge?

34:40.204 --> 34:42.037
- I think it went very well.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.164
<i>I decided to go for
a mixture between</i>

34:44.208 --> 34:47.084
<i>a 16th and a 15th
century shield.</i>

34:47.127 --> 34:48.710
<i>Those are round shields
with a spike,</i>

34:48.754 --> 34:51.171
<i>but they have a gauntlet
incorporated into that.</i>

34:51.215 --> 34:54.216
<i>I had some issues with getting
the articulation right.</i>

34:54.259 --> 34:55.842
Overall, though,
I'm very happy with it.

34:55.886 --> 34:57.803
- Mike, how'd it go for you?

34:57.846 --> 35:00.180
- The original plan was to go
with something simple

35:00.224 --> 35:01.932
but visually appealing.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.855
<i>Things just did not
go my way with the assembly.</i>

35:03.894 --> 35:06.686
<i>I had some issues with
materials and timing.</i>

35:06.730 --> 35:08.688
<i>But overall, I mean,
it fits the dimensions,</i>

35:08.732 --> 35:10.107
<i>it's a functional piece.</i>

35:10.150 --> 35:11.525
<i>You can wear it;
you can test it.</i>

35:11.568 --> 35:12.526
<i>It's ready.</i>

35:12.569 --> 35:13.860
- Great.

35:13.904 --> 35:15.529
We're now gonna be
putting your weapons

35:15.572 --> 35:16.863
through a series of three tests.

35:16.907 --> 35:18.740
First up, the strength test.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.700
Dave?

35:20.744 --> 35:22.035
- Gentlemen.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.246
Between the 13th
and the 16th centuries,

35:24.289 --> 35:26.790
spiked shields were commonly
used by infantry

35:26.834 --> 35:30.252
to protect from swords,
spears, and arrows.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.045
I'm gonna fire three bolts
from a crossbow

35:32.089 --> 35:34.172
to test each of your shields.

35:34.216 --> 35:37.300
If your shield is strong,
it should deflect the arrow.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.927
Ilya, you're up.
You ready?

35:38.971 --> 35:40.929
- Yes, I am.

35:40.973 --> 35:43.390
<i>There's no way the crossbow
is going to harm the shield.</i>

35:43.433 --> 35:46.560
Maybe scratch it a little bit,
but scratches just happen.

35:46.603 --> 35:53.108

36:10.043 --> 36:12.627
- Well, I can see where
the bolts hit, Ilya.

36:12.671 --> 36:17.257
Small impact there, here,
and right there.

36:17.301 --> 36:20.010
Nothing that would even threaten
the man behind this shield.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.012
So that's very well done.

36:22.055 --> 36:24.264
Michael, you're up.
You ready?

36:24.308 --> 36:25.557
- I think so.
Let's do this.

36:25.601 --> 36:26.641
<i>- All right.</i>

36:26.685 --> 36:28.351
<i>- I'm kind of biting my nails.</i>

36:28.395 --> 36:30.395
A little concerned about this,
but I think as long as

36:30.439 --> 36:32.105
things so straight on,
it'll do just fine.

36:32.149 --> 36:33.773

[mouthing] Yes.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.121
- Well, Michael,
I can see where one hit.

36:48.165 --> 36:50.332
I think you have
a bit of a dimple.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.626
One impacted somewhere
on the center boss.

36:52.669 --> 36:53.627
You could actually hear it.

36:53.670 --> 36:54.628
<i>¶ ¶</i>

36:54.671 --> 36:56.254
[thudding]

36:56.298 --> 36:58.131
And though there are some
cosmetic issues

36:58.175 --> 37:00.300
with your shield,
it certainly held up

37:00.344 --> 37:01.426
in the strength test.

37:01.470 --> 37:02.636
So well done.

37:02.679 --> 37:03.637
- Thank you.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.971
- Doug?

37:05.015 --> 37:07.182
- Bladesmiths,
this is the kill test.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.476
With your shield,
I will take four hits

37:09.519 --> 37:11.645
on this ballistics dummy
that's wearing chain mail.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.521
Ilya, you're up.
Are you ready?

37:13.565 --> 37:15.482
- Yes, I am.

37:15.525 --> 37:18.068
The kill test is the one I'm
a little bit concerned about.

37:18.111 --> 37:20.028
I don't know what kind of moves

37:20.072 --> 37:22.405
Doug's going to try
on the dummies.

37:22.449 --> 37:30.449
<i>¶ ¶</i>

37:34.628 --> 37:36.002
- The shield feels good
in the hand.

37:36.046 --> 37:37.379
I can maneuver
in different ways.

37:37.422 --> 37:42.342
You know, not only to protect,
but also to attack.

37:42.386 --> 37:44.010
Now let's see how
much damage it did.

37:44.054 --> 37:46.471
<i>¶ ¶</i>

37:46.515 --> 37:48.890
The killing blows
were right here

37:48.934 --> 37:50.684
where it penetrated all the way.

37:50.727 --> 37:53.728
That's through the sternum
and into the lung.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.563
And...

37:55.607 --> 37:57.691
that is in the belly.

37:57.734 --> 38:02.570
And that goes all the way into
this ballistics dummy.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.322
<i>- I mean, it's disgusting.</i>

38:04.366 --> 38:07.242
I can only imagine what a real
body would have incurred

38:07.286 --> 38:08.702
with a weapon like that.

38:08.745 --> 38:12.872
- Your shield
and the spike will kill.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.165
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:14.209 --> 38:15.417
Mike, it's your turn.
You ready?

38:15.460 --> 38:17.127
- All right.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.045
- Uh, Mike,
your spike's a little bit loose.

38:19.089 --> 38:20.588
Let's see how it goes
in the test.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.632
- We'll see.

38:21.675 --> 38:29.675
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:30.934 --> 38:33.351
- Mike, it feels good
in the hand.

38:33.395 --> 38:34.853
You can strike with the edges.

38:34.896 --> 38:38.440
You can accompany it
with the other hand.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.275
It moves well.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.943
The spike did hold up.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.737
Now let's see
how much damage we did.

38:43.780 --> 38:44.738
- All right.

38:44.781 --> 38:47.574
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:47.617 --> 38:49.576
Ugh, God.

38:49.619 --> 38:52.829
- Your spike definitely
penetrated on both punctures.

38:52.873 --> 38:54.914
Right here,
probably where the diaphragm is.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.499
And in the abdomen right here.

38:56.543 --> 38:58.585
All the way through it.

38:58.628 --> 39:01.963
Your shield will kill.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.798
- Thank you.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.550
<i>I'm feeling
really good right now.</i>

39:05.594 --> 39:08.094
According to Doug, it does kill.

39:08.138 --> 39:10.305
- Bladesmiths,
this is the sharpness test.

39:10.349 --> 39:12.807
I will attach your shield
to this mechanical device.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.184
I will then release your shield

39:14.227 --> 39:15.935
to see if it will
puncture this steel drum.

39:15.979 --> 39:17.979
If your spike is sharp,
it should go in easily.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.440
If not, well,
then we just dent the drum.

39:20.484 --> 39:21.649
Ilya, you're up.
Are you ready?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.276
- Yes, I am.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.654
I am actually worried about
the tip curling in

39:26.698 --> 39:28.448
and then getting stuck
in the barrel.

39:28.492 --> 39:30.950
- Three, two, one.

39:30.994 --> 39:31.951
Engaging.

39:31.995 --> 39:34.621
<i>¶ ¶</i>

39:37.834 --> 39:39.667

39:39.711 --> 39:41.002

- Yes, I am.

39:42.089 --> 39:46.299
<i>¶ ¶</i>

39:46.343 --> 39:48.134
- Three, two, one.

39:48.178 --> 39:49.135

[thudding]

39:51.515 --> 39:54.724
<i>¶ ¶</i>

39:54.768 --> 39:56.976
- Well, Ilya, your spike went
cleanly through the drum

39:57.020 --> 39:58.770
and all the way out.

39:58.814 --> 40:02.482
I don't see any problems or any
deformations on your spike.

40:02.526 --> 40:04.484
It held up very well.
Good job.

40:04.528 --> 40:06.027
- Thank you.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.320
- Mike, you're up.
Are you ready?

40:07.364 --> 40:08.988
- Oh, yeah.
Let's do this.

40:09.032 --> 40:11.199
<i>The lack of a secure
connection on that spike</i>

40:11.243 --> 40:12.826
is definitely giving me
a bit of anxiety

40:12.869 --> 40:14.160
looking at this test
coming up here.

40:14.204 --> 40:15.328
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:15.372 --> 40:17.247
- And in three, two, one.

40:17.290 --> 40:18.331

40:24.381 --> 40:27.715
Well, Mike, your spike
went all the way through.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.008
<i>Got stuck a little bit.</i>

40:29.052 --> 40:30.510
<i>Came out cleanly.</i>

40:30.554 --> 40:33.847
But I do not see
any damage to your spike.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.348
Good job, sir.
- Thank you.

40:35.392 --> 40:36.392
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:36.435 --> 40:37.600
- Bladesmiths.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.227
The weapons tests
are now complete.

40:39.271 --> 40:41.604
The judges are gonna take some
time to make a final decision.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.022
Thank you.

40:43.066 --> 40:44.691
- Winning is a matter
of principle.

40:44.734 --> 40:48.069
And the principle is,
you play for victory.

40:48.113 --> 40:52.073
What I'm looking forward to
is breaking the winning streak

40:52.117 --> 40:53.366
of Michael's Forge.

40:53.410 --> 40:54.742
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:54.786 --> 40:56.619
- Bladesmiths,
you had five days at home

40:56.663 --> 40:58.413
to forge a spiked shield.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.665
The judges have
scrutinized your work

41:00.709 --> 41:02.834
and they've made a final
decision about which of you

41:02.878 --> 41:04.377
is the
"Forged in Fire" champion,

41:04.421 --> 41:07.881
who will receive
a check for $10,000.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.549
- Ilya, you got
a great design there.

41:09.593 --> 41:11.551
<i>I liked the extras
you put into it,</i>

41:11.595 --> 41:14.304
<i>I liked the gauntlet and
the blade stops around the rim.</i>

41:14.347 --> 41:16.598
<i>My big concern is,
in a combat situation,</i>

41:16.641 --> 41:18.558
<i>after you have somebody
strap that to your arm,</i>

41:18.602 --> 41:20.393
<i>if another weapon
gets hung up in there</i>

41:20.437 --> 41:22.896
<i>like a spear or an ax or
something from an opponent,</i>

41:22.939 --> 41:25.231
that shield's drug down
and you're wide open.

41:25.275 --> 41:26.733
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:26.776 --> 41:28.109
- Comments for Mike.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.820
- Mike,
your shield tested beautifully.

41:30.864 --> 41:34.407
<i>But those missing components,
those holes left in your shield</i>

41:34.451 --> 41:36.576
<i>because those parts
aren't attached,</i>

41:36.620 --> 41:38.077
<i>those eventually
will become places</i>

41:38.121 --> 41:39.579
<i>where an arrow can penetrate.</i>

41:39.623 --> 41:40.580
Those are a problem.

41:40.624 --> 41:42.165
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:42.209 --> 41:44.709
- Gentlemen,
this was a tough competition.

41:44.753 --> 41:46.628
But in this arena,
there can only be one

41:46.671 --> 41:47.921
"Forged in Fire" champion.

You are the

42:01.228 --> 42:04.103

did not make the cut.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.105
- Mike, in this competition,

42:06.149 --> 42:09.108
performance over fit
and finish is key.

42:09.152 --> 42:11.110
But there were just too many
unfinished pieces

42:11.154 --> 42:13.613
with your shield to move on.

42:13.657 --> 42:15.949
- Mike, please surrender
your shield.

42:15.992 --> 42:19.035
<i>¶ ¶</i>

42:19.079 --> 42:20.828
- This was a

42:20.872 --> 42:23.289
Considering the pressure of
having three previous winners

42:23.333 --> 42:25.542
in the same shop,
I think I performed very well.

42:25.585 --> 42:27.293
<i>So as much as I would have
liked to win,</i>

42:27.337 --> 42:28.962

42:41.518 --> 42:43.643
just fantastic piece, I think.

42:43.687 --> 42:46.479
- I'm fairly satisfied
with the end results.

42:46.523 --> 42:50.817
I might not often show it,
but trust me, I am proud.
