08:54.318 --> 08:57.704
"yeah! Dig sex and I'm not
gonna apologize for it."

08:57.738 --> 09:00.824
- Okay, here's a little
bedroom tip.

09:00.875 --> 09:04.544
Put a bag of popcorn
in the microwave beforehand.

09:04.579 --> 09:06.779
That way, when you're done,
you have a treat.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.916
- I wish I had your
emotional intelligence.

09:09.950 --> 09:13.587
My boyfriend razmig and I
have hit a little rough patch.

09:13.621 --> 09:16.423
- Okay.
Lay it on me.

09:16.457 --> 09:20.460
- Well, I went home
this afternoon to get some,

09:20.478 --> 09:24.797
And I found razmig banging the
fattest chick I've ever seen.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.234
And you know,
I used to weigh 800 pounds.

09:27.268 --> 09:28.602
- Stop right there.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.353
You didn't hit a rough patch.
He cheated on you.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.804
You have to dump him
immediately.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.107
- What?
How can you say that?

09:34.141 --> 09:35.442
- Hazel,
I'm trying to help you.

09:35.476 --> 09:37.477
- By asking me to break up
with the man I love?

09:37.495 --> 09:40.830
Helping me would be teaching me
how to spice things up.

09:40.865 --> 09:42.532
Like by greeting him
at the front door

09:42.583 --> 09:44.751
Wearing nothing
but false teeth.

09:44.785 --> 09:48.154
I'm very disappointed
in your mentorship, liz.

09:48.172 --> 09:49.489
If this were two years ago,

09:49.507 --> 09:51.174
I would sit on you
till you died.

09:55.580 --> 09:57.597
- No wigs.

09:57.632 --> 10:00.500
I said no wigs.

10:00.518 --> 10:02.052
You're not a lead, gabe.

10:02.103 --> 10:04.387
At best, you're a featured extra
with no lines.

10:04.438 --> 10:09.059
Do you understand?
- Hey, gabe.

10:09.110 --> 10:11.444
- Lemon, would you be interested
in writing the screenplay

10:11.479 --> 10:13.446
For the greatest love story
ever told?

10:13.481 --> 10:17.016
- You mean lois lane's love
affair with journalism?

10:17.034 --> 10:18.652
I said it.
- Avery and me.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.537
I'm producing
a television movie

10:20.571 --> 10:21.955
To get her back
in the headlines.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.157
For obvious reasons,
I'm fast-tracking the project.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.293
The script is due on Monday.
- Monday?

10:26.327 --> 10:28.461
Hmm. I guess I won't be able
to go to the gym this weekend.

10:28.496 --> 10:29.796
- I know it's short notice,

10:29.830 --> 10:31.581
But I would consider it
a personal favor

10:31.632 --> 10:33.366
After six years of listening
to you complain

10:33.384 --> 10:35.418
About how there are
so few women on death row.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.138
- Is a coincidence,
or is the system sexist?

10:38.172 --> 10:40.924
Oh! Speaking
of our amazing dynamic,

10:40.975 --> 10:42.875
I have taken on a mentee
of my own, jack--

10:42.893 --> 10:44.010
A page named hazel.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.378
- You're a mentor?

10:45.396 --> 10:47.230
But that makes me
a grand-mentor.

10:47.265 --> 10:49.282
And I'm still so young.
- Don't worry.

10:49.317 --> 10:50.600
I already messed it up.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.103
I told her to break up
with her awful boyfriend

10:53.137 --> 10:54.654
And she got really mad at me.

10:54.689 --> 10:56.273
- Often, the best way
for a mentee to learn

10:56.324 --> 10:57.657
Is for you
to let her fail.

10:57.692 --> 10:59.192
- Wait, does that mean
you've done that to me?

10:59.226 --> 11:00.994
When?
- Um--

11:01.028 --> 11:02.329
- I think the crowd
at the apollo

11:02.363 --> 11:03.697
Might welcome
a change of pace.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.949
- You're right.
You should do it.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.118
Sometimes, they have
to learn the hard way.

11:08.169 --> 11:09.703
If hazel rejects your advice,
let her.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.204
She'll get there on her own

11:11.238 --> 11:12.589
Just like you did
after the crowd at the apollo

11:12.623 --> 11:14.291
Chased you into the river.

11:14.342 --> 11:17.577
- Okay, I understand the irony
of what I'm about to say,

11:17.595 --> 11:20.130
But I reject that advice.

11:20.181 --> 11:22.582
Don't worry, I'll bring you back
a t-shirt from successtown.

11:22.600 --> 11:27.387
Ow! My groin!

11:27.421 --> 11:29.589
- Mr. Jordan!
- K-dog.

11:29.607 --> 11:32.425
You were wrong.
They do still make crossbows.

11:32.443 --> 11:34.811
- You let him buy a crossbow?

11:34.862 --> 11:36.363
And a motorcycle?

11:36.397 --> 11:38.931
- No, kenneth, I let him buy
a motorcycle ramp

11:38.949 --> 11:41.534
And no motorcycle!

11:44.538 --> 11:46.406
Can I help you?

11:46.440 --> 11:49.075
Tracy's very tired.
He didn't sleep last night.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.410
- Why not?

11:50.444 --> 11:51.944
If he doesn't get at least
14 hours a night,

11:51.962 --> 11:53.413
He starts to go crazy.

11:53.447 --> 11:54.881
- We on a show within a show!

11:54.915 --> 11:57.116
My real name
is tracy morgan!

11:57.134 --> 11:58.752
- Well, tracy wanted
to go clubbing.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.470
And I don't know
if you know this, kenneth,

12:00.504 --> 12:02.389
But night clubs
are open at night.

12:02.423 --> 12:04.724
- You didn't let him drink,
did you?

12:04.759 --> 12:07.293
Mr. Jordan can't mix alcohol
with his medication.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.929
- I'm not an idiot, kenneth.
I took him off his medication.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.314
- You what?

12:11.349 --> 12:12.732
Why are you doing this?

12:12.767 --> 12:14.651
- Because liz told me to.

12:14.685 --> 12:17.470
Having access to tracy
is an opportunity,

12:17.488 --> 12:19.239
And I'm
taking advantage of it.

12:19.273 --> 12:22.275
Did you see page six today?

12:22.309 --> 12:24.244
Those are my toes
he's sucking on.

12:24.278 --> 12:27.614
And he did not want to.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.920
[gasping]
ah, mm.

12:36.424 --> 12:39.092
- Jack!

12:39.126 --> 12:40.993
What the hell is this?

12:41.011 --> 12:43.129
- Where did you get that?

12:43.163 --> 12:45.382
- Donna from casting and I
are friends.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.766
Well, not so much friends

12:46.801 --> 12:48.551
As I own a magnet
that can scramble her pacemaker.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.387
- Jenna,
you are not playing avery.

12:50.438 --> 12:52.722
- Why not?
This movie was my idea!

12:52.773 --> 12:54.057
- I appreciate that.

12:54.108 --> 12:56.860
You can play
a korean party whore.

12:56.894 --> 12:59.178
I just don't think you can
capture avery's essence.

12:59.196 --> 13:01.147
- That's ridiculous.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.616
<i>I posed bottomless in essence.</i>

13:03.651 --> 13:05.869
- Jenna, avery is worldly.
Traveled.

13:05.903 --> 13:06.986
She went to yale.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.405
- Oh, I see.

13:08.456 --> 13:11.074
You think I'm stupid,
just because my college

13:11.125 --> 13:13.076
Got tipped
over by those miami heat fans.

13:13.127 --> 13:14.694
- I didn't say stupid.

13:14.712 --> 13:16.162
Jenna, there are many kinds
of intelligence.

13:16.196 --> 13:19.549
Practical, emotional,
and there's actual intelligence,

13:19.583 --> 13:21.301
Which is
what I'm talking about.

13:21.335 --> 13:23.052
- I want this part, jack.

13:23.087 --> 13:24.921
It's a guaranteed
emmy nomination.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.923
- I'm sorry.
I've made up my mind.

13:26.974 --> 13:30.042
- Very well.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.928
But let me
ask you this, jack.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.380
Would a dumb person be able
to think of something amazing

13:34.398 --> 13:39.018
To say as she leaves?

13:42.857 --> 13:44.774
- Liz, we have a show
in four hours.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.359
Have you still not picked
a contest winner?

13:46.393 --> 13:49.061
- Ugh! Fine,
I'll just pick one at random.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.030
It's joren van der sloot.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.832
- We can't fly someone
from peru now.

13:52.867 --> 13:55.702
There's no time.

13:55.736 --> 13:58.455
- Oh, hazel, we need to talk.
- I'm busy, liz.

13:58.506 --> 14:01.291
Tracy wants me to paom in .

14:01.342 --> 14:02.675
Is this dress appropriate

14:02.710 --> 14:04.177
For watching pornography
with penn jillette?

14:04.211 --> 14:07.096
- Okay, normally we don't
encourage tracy to go to vegas,

14:07.131 --> 14:10.133
Because of his gambling
addiction and his fear of magic.

14:10.184 --> 14:12.769
But maybe a weekend away
from razmig is a good thing.

14:12.803 --> 14:15.054
- No.
Razmig's coming with me.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.589
- [armenian accent] what?
Who is this, hah-zel?

14:16.607 --> 14:18.608
I no permit you talk
other woman.

14:18.642 --> 14:20.026
- Okay, I'm putting
my foot down.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.646
This guy is no good for you
and I order you, as your mentor,

14:23.697 --> 14:25.114
To dump him.

14:25.149 --> 14:26.766
- You don't know what you're
talking about, liz.

14:26.784 --> 14:29.602
Razmig is amazing.
He makes me laugh.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.489
- Oh, where is toilet pail?
Razmig must make mud.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.958
- [chuckling]
razmig!

14:34.992 --> 14:36.609
- Hazel, no.
I'm not letting you--

14:36.627 --> 14:38.778
- [jack's voice echoing]
let her fail, liz.

14:38.796 --> 14:41.714
Let her get there on her own.

14:41.749 --> 14:44.300
- You know what, fine.
You're right, I'm wrong.

14:44.335 --> 14:47.286
Go, be with razmig.
- Thank you, liz.

14:47.304 --> 14:51.508
It takes a big woman
to admit she's wrong.

14:51.559 --> 14:52.675
- You are a big woman.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.628
You have pictures?
Fat nudes?

15:01.969 --> 15:03.970
- [knocking]
I need your help, ms. Maroney.

15:03.988 --> 15:06.573
- Absolutely.

15:06.607 --> 15:08.691
Oh, I thought
you were someone famous.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.076
You sound a lot
like reese witherspoon.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.611
What do you want?

15:11.645 --> 15:14.163
- I'm afraid if mr. Jordan
goes to las vegas this weekend,

15:14.198 --> 15:15.648
He's gonna die.

15:15.666 --> 15:16.749
- I'm not hearing my name,
kenneth.

15:16.784 --> 15:18.701
- So I thought you--

15:18.752 --> 15:20.954
- Oh, thank god.
That took forever.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.656
- I thought you could teach me
how to get around hazel.

15:23.674 --> 15:27.460
If I could just get one minute
alone with mr. Jordan--

15:27.494 --> 15:30.179
- You can convince him
he's wrong. Yes!

15:30.214 --> 15:32.549
But how do you get
his attention?

15:32.600 --> 15:35.435
All the world's a stage,
kenneth.

15:35.469 --> 15:38.104
Just play the part.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.306
- Play the part?

15:46.901 --> 15:46.901
+

15:49.416 --> 15:51.701
- Ms. Lemon.

15:51.752 --> 15:53.086
If it's not too late,

15:53.120 --> 15:54.987
I would like the essay contest
to win a role

15:55.005 --> 15:56.822
<i>On   tgs with tracy jordan.</i>

15:56.840 --> 15:58.374
- No, kenneth,
you can't enter.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.209
The contest isn't open
to nbc employees.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.994
- I know, ma'am-maw.

16:02.012 --> 16:03.829
Which is why I just
quit my job

16:03.847 --> 16:05.632
At standards and practices.

16:05.666 --> 16:07.500
- I may [bleep] hate you
right now,

16:07.518 --> 16:10.970
You little [bleep], but
[bleep] damn it I respect you.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.305
- Kenneth,
you know this is just

16:12.339 --> 16:14.006
To be a non-speaking extra,
right?

16:14.024 --> 16:15.341
- I know.

16:15.359 --> 16:18.144
But have you ever loved
something so much

16:18.178 --> 16:20.063
That you would sacrifice
anything for it?

16:20.114 --> 16:21.447
- Nope.

16:21.482 --> 16:23.616
But you know what,
this is perfect.

16:23.651 --> 16:25.868
Because then I don't have
to pick some crazy person,

16:25.903 --> 16:27.737
And I know you won't do anything
weird on the air.

16:27.788 --> 16:29.072
- I'm kenneth!

16:29.123 --> 16:31.190
- Get to wardrobe,
contest winner!

16:31.208 --> 16:33.292
This is gonna be
a great show.

16:40.050 --> 16:42.752
- Hello?
- Hi, it's charles from the u.N.

16:42.803 --> 16:44.087
We found your wife

16:44.138 --> 16:46.055
And I dropped her off
at the office.

16:46.090 --> 16:48.508
She should be there
right about now.

16:50.761 --> 16:54.147
- Jack, it's me.
I'm home.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.782
- No, you're not my wife.

16:55.816 --> 16:57.567
- How could you say that,
darling?

16:57.601 --> 17:00.236
I'm avery jesbert.
- Jenna?

17:00.270 --> 17:02.188
- No, don't turn on
the light.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.690
Surprised?

17:03.724 --> 17:07.944
- Let's set aside
how idiotic that plan was,

17:07.994 --> 17:10.445
And imagine a world
where it actually worked.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.830
- I appreciate your feedback.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.233
- If I had believed you
for one second,

17:14.251 --> 17:16.285
I would've been devastated,
heartbroken!

17:16.336 --> 17:18.287
- You wanna talk
about devastation?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.589
How do you think I felt when you
told me I couldn't play avery?

17:20.624 --> 17:22.125
- You are a monster.

17:22.175 --> 17:25.627
What you have done here today,
it's--it's...

17:25.679 --> 17:29.248
The second cruelest thing
that anyone has ever done to me.

17:29.283 --> 17:30.600
Do you know what
the cruelest is?

17:30.634 --> 17:32.068
- When I went to the bathroom
on the hood of your car

17:32.102 --> 17:33.686
Before I thought of this plan?

17:33.721 --> 17:35.338
- Avery had me committed
to a mental hospital

17:35.372 --> 17:36.756
So she
and her college roommate

17:36.774 --> 17:38.307
Could use my yankee tickets
on opening day.

17:38.358 --> 17:41.778
- That's a nice story, jack,
but I don't hear my name in it.

17:41.812 --> 17:43.696
- You--
- finally.

17:43.731 --> 17:46.983
- You may not have
avery's grace and acumen,

17:47.034 --> 17:49.869
But you do have the one thing
that makes her so special--

17:49.903 --> 17:52.572
Her ruthless pursuit
of self-interest.

17:52.606 --> 17:54.607
It's the heart of capitalism.

17:54.641 --> 17:59.579
And the beautiful black heart
of my wife.

17:59.613 --> 18:03.583
Jenna, you have avery's essence.
Congratulations.

18:03.617 --> 18:05.117
The part is yours.

18:05.135 --> 18:07.754
- Oh! You won't regret this.

18:07.788 --> 18:09.756
We're gonna get her home,
jack.

18:09.790 --> 18:11.073
Now if you'll excuse me,

18:11.108 --> 18:12.925
I have a female condom
to take out.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.293
Unless...

18:14.311 --> 18:16.095
Going once...

18:16.129 --> 18:20.183
- Four, three--

18:20.234 --> 18:21.934
[audience cheering]

18:21.968 --> 18:23.486
- Ladies and gentlemen,

18:23.520 --> 18:26.589
A message from the president
of the United States.

18:26.623 --> 18:29.575
- Goo-goo, ga-ga,
my fellow ah-meh-ri-cans.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.612
- Okay, he's never been worse.

18:32.646 --> 18:34.614
Is kenneth supposed to enter?

18:34.648 --> 18:35.832
- I love you, sir.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.033
- Ken, where have you been?

18:37.084 --> 18:39.035
- Damn it.
- I've been here all along.

18:39.086 --> 18:41.287
I never left.
And I never will.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.588
- Go to commercial.

18:42.623 --> 18:43.823
- They told us
we can't do that any more.

18:43.841 --> 18:44.990
- What?

18:45.008 --> 18:46.926
- I quit my job
to be here, mr. Jordan.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.878
It was the only way
I could get around hazel.

18:48.929 --> 18:51.130
- You quit your job for me?

18:51.164 --> 18:55.218
- I'm not just gonna sit by
and watch you destroy yourself.

18:55.269 --> 18:58.170
'cause I would do anything
for love,

18:58.188 --> 18:59.939
But I won't do that.

18:59.973 --> 19:05.812
- The girl in that video was hot
in an early '90s kind of way.

19:05.846 --> 19:09.799
- Now...Take your medicine.

19:09.833 --> 19:11.167
- This has been a message

19:11.201 --> 19:14.320
From the president
of the United States.

19:15.989 --> 19:18.491
- Tough night?

19:18.525 --> 19:19.992
Come on, lemon.
The show was all right.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.460
What about the sketch
with the guy who was worried

19:21.495 --> 19:23.129
About his sexual performance?

19:23.163 --> 19:25.331
- That was a real commercial for
an erectile dysfunction drug.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.032
- Well, I laughed.

19:27.050 --> 19:29.302
So, uh, how did things
shake out with hazel?

19:29.336 --> 19:31.137
- Not great.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.172
My way, which is still
the right way, didn't work.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.091
So just to see,
I did your thing.

19:35.142 --> 19:37.009
- Good.
You let her fail.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.595
That's how the banking industry
learned its lesson.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.814
And now they're doing amazing,
and everyone's honest.

19:41.849 --> 19:43.883
- Mm. Your thing
didn't work either.

19:43.901 --> 19:47.603
- Are you sure?

19:51.491 --> 19:56.529
Mentoring is not
an exact science.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.947
- Why aren't there
more female serial killers?

19:57.998 --> 19:59.332
What does that say
about our society--

19:59.366 --> 20:00.366
- Liz!

20:00.400 --> 20:02.902
- Oh, here she is.
She's here.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.237
- Liz, I was watching the show
fall apart

20:05.255 --> 20:08.073
While razmig gave me
a prison tattoo of his face,

20:08.091 --> 20:09.292
And I heard your voice.

20:09.343 --> 20:12.411
I finally heard
everything you said to me.

20:12.429 --> 20:14.413
"hazel,
you're a beautiful flower.

20:14.431 --> 20:16.265
"let yourself bloom.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.583
"what are you doing
this weekend, hazel?

20:17.601 --> 20:20.386
Are there still bath houses?
Let's go to one!"

20:20.420 --> 20:21.721
- I never said any of that,
but--

20:21.755 --> 20:23.105
- You were right all along.

20:23.140 --> 20:25.691
You knew I was making
the wrong choices.

20:25.726 --> 20:28.728
But you let me fail.
With razmig, with tracy.

20:28.762 --> 20:30.613
- Yes, I was definitely
on top of that tracy thing.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.431
- You were teaching me
the whole time,

20:32.449 --> 20:36.101
And all the while lighting
a fire with that hot ass.

20:36.119 --> 20:38.788
- I'm...Jack.

20:38.822 --> 20:43.075
I'm your grand-mentor.
Liz?

20:43.109 --> 20:46.329
She's beautiful.

20:49.498 --> 20:49.498
+

20:59.781 --> 21:03.634
Okay! Please welcome
to the stage leminem!

21:03.668 --> 21:04.768
Ooh!

21:04.803 --> 21:07.238
[scattered applause, booing]

21:07.272 --> 21:11.318
- ♪ ahhh, do the sprinkler
