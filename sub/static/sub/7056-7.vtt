I wasn't going to stay
for that much longer.

00:19.088 --> 00:21.255
I just needed
to see her.

00:21.290 --> 00:23.356
It's fine that you come here.
Just tell me.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.323
I want to understand
what you're going through.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.291
You're right.

00:27.325 --> 00:29.193
Their abilities
are aided by tech.

00:29.227 --> 00:31.593
<i>Well, hello, there.</i>

00:31.628 --> 00:32.761
You are nothing.

00:32.795 --> 00:34.495
I would be ten times
what you are

00:34.529 --> 00:35.962
if I had that tech
in my head.

00:36.930 --> 00:38.763
I know what you have done.

00:38.798 --> 00:41.565
You do not realize

You have a meeting.
You can't be late.

This will not take long.

01:57.218 --> 02:01.353
<i>Was that part of it, or no?</i>

02:01.388 --> 02:03.621
<i>I'm not absolutely sure.</i>

02:03.656 --> 02:05.056
<i>You want to update</i>

02:18.603 --> 02:20.803
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

02:20.838 --> 02:21.838
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

02:32.815 --> 02:34.715
<i>To the left?</i>

02:34.750 --> 02:38.552
<i>Right around the corner.</i>

02:38.587 --> 02:40.921
<i>The tall one, to the right.</i>

02:40.955 --> 02:42.822
<i>Oh, I see him.</i>

02:48.628 --> 02:49.928
Excuse <i>me.</i>

02:55.167 --> 02:56.867
<i>Yeah, that'd be great.</i>

02:56.902 --> 02:58.869
<i>Let's walk.</i>

02:58.903 --> 03:00.771
<i>It wasn't available.</i>

03:00.805 --> 03:03.173
<i>Ugh.</i>

03:03.207 --> 03:05.342
<i>I'm not absolutely sure.</i>

03:05.376 --> 03:07.443

03:14.617 --> 03:15.650
<i>I have an extra one.</i>

03:15.685 --> 03:17.018
<i>Oh, you do?</i>

03:17.053 --> 03:18.754
<i>Yeah, wanna take a look at it?</i>

03:18.788 --> 03:20.589
<i>Very well.</i>
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

03:20.623 --> 03:24.359

You were gone

04:10.530 --> 04:12.931
He wasn't as interested
in bartering as I anticipated.

04:12.966 --> 04:14.633
It took some convincing.

04:14.667 --> 04:18.202
Gasoline for neon helium

You left without me.

04:44.497 --> 04:45.797
I wanted to go with you.

04:45.832 --> 04:47.266
It was so early.
You were sleeping.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.300
I didn't want to wake you.

04:48.335 --> 04:51.471
That's one way
to put it.

04:51.505 --> 04:54.708
The other is that
you didn't sleep again.

04:57.579 --> 05:00.981
That's true.
I couldn't sleep.

05:01.016 --> 05:02.916
But I'm fine.

05:04.585 --> 05:06.119
You need to sleep,
Peter.

05:21.100 --> 05:24.203
Locked.

05:26.072 --> 05:28.941
<i>What do we got?</i>

05:28.976 --> 05:32.745
On the move.
Rolling.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.188
We're okay.

05:54.902 --> 05:59.472
This is tape five of my plan
to defeat the Observers.

05:59.506 --> 06:02.742
<i>This is what you</i>
<i>must achieve next.</i>

06:02.776 --> 06:06.579
These cylinders were designed
by the invaders.

06:06.614 --> 06:08.214
They are beacons
that allow them

06:08.248 --> 06:10.783
to locate different points
in spacetime.

06:10.817 --> 06:12.651
You will need two of them.

06:15.722 --> 06:17.624
This is
where you will find them.

06:17.658 --> 06:19.926
I know that building.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.862
That was one of our labs
at Kelvin Genetics.

06:22.897 --> 06:24.597
Belly and I designed it.

06:24.632 --> 06:26.566
<i>From the east entrance,</i>

06:26.600 --> 06:29.869
follow the hallway,
two yellow doors.

06:29.904 --> 06:31.304
They lead to a staircase.

06:31.338 --> 06:32.639
At the bottom
of that staircase,

06:32.673 --> 06:34.541
you will find
the private storage

06:34.575 --> 06:38.311
of William Bell.

06:38.346 --> 06:39.646
At the time
of recording this,

06:39.680 --> 06:42.048
Bell was keeping
two Observer cylinders

06:42.083 --> 06:44.951
in that storage facility.

06:44.985 --> 06:46.419
<i>You must retrieve them.</i>

06:46.453 --> 06:49.489
<i>The doors are made</i>
<i>of reinforced steel.</i>

06:49.523 --> 06:52.592
They can be unlocked
with Bell's handprint.

06:52.626 --> 06:54.694
<i>Walter, that's why</i>
<i>you took Bell's hand</i>

06:54.729 --> 06:56.396
<i>when we were freed</i>
<i>from the amber.</i>

06:56.430 --> 06:57.831
You said that it was

06:57.865 --> 06:58.865
for a storage facility.
It was for this.

06:58.899 --> 07:00.099
<i>If you cannot find Bell</i>

07:00.134 --> 07:01.735
<i>or if you learn</i>
<i>that he is dead,</i>

07:01.769 --> 07:03.470
<i>you will have</i>
<i>to unlock the storage...</i>

07:03.504 --> 07:07.173
So that's why he was
with us in the amber.

07:07.207 --> 07:08.941
<i>I needed him</i>
<i>to get the cylinders.</i>

07:08.975 --> 07:11.210
<i>Your freedom depends</i>
<i>on it.</i>

07:11.244 --> 07:14.246
Walter, that's not
the only reason.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.348
Hmm?

07:16.382 --> 07:18.150
Well,
before the invasion,

07:18.184 --> 07:20.153
you had been talking
with Bell.

07:20.187 --> 07:23.956
He said that he wanted to help
you defeat the Observers,

07:23.991 --> 07:26.325
<i>that he realized</i>
<i>how important this was.</i>

07:26.359 --> 07:31.363
And then he betrayed us
to gain favor with them.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.134
I do remember something
about this.

07:36.169 --> 07:39.638
He came,
and I trusted him.

07:39.672 --> 07:41.573
There was another man.

07:41.608 --> 07:46.579
He had an accent.
I was being tortured.

07:46.613 --> 07:48.915
He kept asking me
something.

07:48.949 --> 07:53.853
He kept asking...
"Is it safe?"

07:53.888 --> 07:56.289
<i>Then I escaped,</i>
<i>and Bell helped me.</i>

07:56.324 --> 07:58.592
And then he drove me
right back

07:58.626 --> 07:59.960
<i>where I was being</i>
<i>questioned.</i>

07:59.995 --> 08:03.063
He worked for them.
He worked for <i>them!</i>

08:03.097 --> 08:06.666
Walter, that's
from the movie <i>Marathon Man.</i>

08:06.701 --> 08:08.535
<i>Huh.</i>

08:08.569 --> 08:10.270
You called me
in Boston.

08:10.304 --> 08:11.905
You told me that you were ready
to implement the plan

08:11.939 --> 08:13.707
but that you needed my help
to do so.

08:13.741 --> 08:15.742
<i>Then you sent me</i>
<i>to Grand Central Station</i>

08:15.777 --> 08:17.544
to collect
the thought unifier.

08:17.578 --> 08:18.946
<i>And by the time I got</i>
<i>to you and Astrid,</i>

08:18.980 --> 08:20.180
<i>you were with William Bell,</i>

08:20.215 --> 08:21.482
but then the Observers
found us,

08:21.516 --> 08:22.783
and we realized
that the only way

08:22.817 --> 08:24.518
they could have known
where we were

08:24.552 --> 08:29.456
is if he told them.
That's when you Ambered us.

08:29.491 --> 08:32.558
So if Bell led the Observers
to you,

08:32.592 --> 08:34.160
how can we be sure
that the cylinders

08:34.195 --> 08:35.496
were even there
to begin with?

08:35.530 --> 08:38.599
Or if he even had them?

08:38.633 --> 08:42.469
Let's open his storage
and find out.

08:42.503 --> 08:44.971
Fire up the laser,
Agnes.

08:45.006 --> 08:47.440
Let's get that hand
out of Amber.

08:53.013 --> 09:01.220
♪ ♪

09:18.272 --> 09:19.672
Oh, my.

09:22.509 --> 09:24.844
Is this it,
Walter?

09:24.878 --> 09:26.446
Yes.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.181
I used to drop acid

09:28.215 --> 09:29.982
right over there
and watch the ships

09:30.017 --> 09:31.317
come in from the bay.

09:31.351 --> 09:33.586

09:44.097 --> 09:47.333
Peter?

09:47.367 --> 09:48.868
From an engineering standpoint,
they'd have to be.

09:48.902 --> 09:50.736
No, Peter, your ear.

10:05.084 --> 10:07.469
When they closed where
the Observer's shipping lane,

10:07.470 --> 10:10.171
Peter fired anti-matter
into it with an RPG.

10:10.206 --> 10:12.574
<i>Do you think maybe</i>
<i>the blast damaged his ear?</i>

10:12.608 --> 10:14.909
How's your hearing, son?

10:14.943 --> 10:18.045
My hearing's fine.
I'm fine. Really.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.848
<i>I want to examine you as soon</i>
<i>as we get back to the lab.</i>

10:23.318 --> 10:24.985
What are you thinking,
Astrid?

10:25.020 --> 10:27.721
<i>We have some anti-matter</i>
<i>batons left.</i>

10:27.756 --> 10:29.023
<i>Maybe we could use them</i>

10:29.057 --> 10:30.457
to clear a path
to the door.

10:30.492 --> 10:32.092
<i>Anti-matter would consume</i>

10:32.127 --> 10:33.961
not only the debris,
but the storage facility

10:33.995 --> 10:36.563
underneath as well.

10:36.597 --> 10:37.530
What about Anil?

10:37.565 --> 10:39.799
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>he has manpower.</i>

10:39.834 --> 10:41.567
Maybe the resistance
would help us.

10:41.602 --> 10:43.436
The heavy machinery
we'd have to use

10:43.470 --> 10:45.271
to clear away all the rubble
would draw too much attention.

10:47.274 --> 10:48.808
We go through it.

10:51.111 --> 10:53.078
It's Anil.

10:53.113 --> 10:54.913
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>we go through it, Walter?</i>

10:54.947 --> 10:57.616
How did it go?
I couldn't give him the briefcase.

10:57.650 --> 11:00.119
What happened?

11:00.153 --> 11:01.887
<i>I followed the baldie</i>
<i>into the park.</i>

11:01.921 --> 11:03.755
I did everything
just like you said.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.224
<i>You should have seen him</i>
<i>sit at a bench.</i>

11:05.258 --> 11:06.592
And you should have seen him
stand up

11:06.626 --> 11:07.860
and forget his briefcase.

11:07.894 --> 11:09.094
You would have then
approached him

11:09.129 --> 11:11.764
and given him the one
that I gave you.

11:11.798 --> 11:13.766
He never forgot
his briefcase, Peter.

11:13.800 --> 11:17.502
<i>He was sitting on the bench.</i>
<i>I saw him get up.</i>

11:17.537 --> 11:19.871
But he took his briefcase
with him.

11:21.641 --> 11:24.876
That's impossible.

11:24.911 --> 11:27.045
Wait there.
I'm coming to you.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.447
Peter,

11:28.481 --> 11:30.115
we need to see
Nina Sharp.

11:30.149 --> 11:31.883
Walter thinks that
if we can change

11:31.918 --> 11:33.285
the molecular structure
of the concrete,

11:33.319 --> 11:34.619
then maybe we can clear it.

11:34.654 --> 11:36.188
Nina works for the Ministry
of Science.

11:36.222 --> 11:37.956
She's got access
to advanced technology.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.859
Okay, you go talk to Nina.
I have to meet up with Anil.

11:40.893 --> 11:42.260
Why?

11:42.294 --> 11:43.494
He didn't want to say
over the comm,

11:43.528 --> 11:46.864
just that it was important.

11:46.898 --> 11:49.866
You've got that look
on your face.

11:49.901 --> 11:52.603
What look?

11:52.637 --> 11:54.304
The look that says,
"I'm worried about you."

11:54.339 --> 11:58.442
Should I be?
Absolutely not.

12:01.612 --> 12:02.846
You go talk to Nina.

12:02.881 --> 12:05.483
I'll liberate myself
a ride.

12:13.392 --> 12:14.459
<i>Ms. Sharp?</i>

12:14.493 --> 12:16.694
<i>Ms. Sharp?</i>

12:30.542 --> 12:33.444
Uh, push
my afternoon meetings.

12:33.478 --> 12:35.546
I'll be out of the office
for a bit.

13:00.938 --> 13:04.573
I never thought
I would see you again.

13:18.787 --> 13:22.423
So how are you
holding up?

13:22.457 --> 13:25.159
It's been hard.

13:25.193 --> 13:29.063
But we're continuing on
with Walter's plan...

13:29.097 --> 13:32.233
for Etta.

13:32.267 --> 13:35.469
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

13:35.504 --> 13:38.606
Etta was very special
to me.

13:40.275 --> 13:44.579
And when Phillip told me...

13:44.613 --> 13:47.148
I wanted to reach out
to you so much,

13:47.182 --> 13:50.118
but I was afraid that I
would jeopardize your safety.

13:50.152 --> 13:53.621
I know.

13:53.656 --> 13:56.791
<i>But now we have</i>
<i>no choice.</i>

13:56.825 --> 14:00.062
We need your help, Nina.

14:00.096 --> 14:04.133
Of course.
Anything.

14:04.167 --> 14:06.735
Well, despite the damage
to the building, we still think

14:06.770 --> 14:08.404
that the underground storage
is intact.

14:08.438 --> 14:10.472
We just can't get to it.

14:10.507 --> 14:12.708
I was hoping you would have
access to technology

14:12.743 --> 14:15.244
that could...

14:18.549 --> 14:20.884
Change the atomic structure
of the rubble,

14:20.918 --> 14:22.152
and help us clear it.

14:22.186 --> 14:23.686
The Observers
created a device

14:23.721 --> 14:26.189
that dramatically alters
atmospheric pressure,

14:26.223 --> 14:27.790
<i>speeding up molecules</i>

14:27.825 --> 14:29.391
<i>in all the matter</i>
<i>in a controlled area.</i>

14:29.426 --> 14:31.360
A process called
sublimation.

14:31.394 --> 14:33.729
You mean converting solid matter
directly into gas?

14:33.763 --> 14:36.698
So all the rubble
would just evaporate?

14:36.732 --> 14:38.199
Well, essentially, yes.

14:38.234 --> 14:40.635
They used the technology
to clear large areas of land

14:40.669 --> 14:42.904
for construction,
like Central Park,

14:42.938 --> 14:44.339
<i>when they were prepping it</i>
<i>to build</i>

14:44.373 --> 14:46.040
<i>their air-degradation</i>
<i>machine.</i>

14:46.075 --> 14:47.875
I'll meet you in the south side
of the building

14:47.909 --> 14:49.610
in ten minutes.

15:13.436 --> 15:15.570
Are you angry
with me, Walter?

15:15.604 --> 15:17.739
Why should I be?

15:17.773 --> 15:21.242
Because I told Etta and Simon
how to reimplant

15:21.276 --> 15:25.680
the portion of your brain
you had removed.

15:25.714 --> 15:28.984
You did what was necessary.
Yes, I did.

15:29.018 --> 15:31.186
We needed your intellect
restored.

15:31.220 --> 15:34.422
There was a lot at stake.
There still is.

15:34.457 --> 15:37.326
Have you noticed any changes
in your personality

15:37.360 --> 15:39.862
since the implant?

15:39.896 --> 15:41.463
Some.

15:41.498 --> 15:45.234
The tissues are integrating
faster than I thought.

15:48.939 --> 15:51.407
The man I was before...

15:51.442 --> 15:54.444
Do you see him in me now?

15:54.479 --> 15:57.147
No.

15:57.182 --> 15:59.617
But you would know
better than I.

16:02.054 --> 16:05.089
Are you worried?

16:09.294 --> 16:14.233
The man I was before,
he was consumed by ambition,

16:14.267 --> 16:16.068
by hubris.

16:16.102 --> 16:18.070
He never cared
about anyone.

16:18.105 --> 16:20.439
All he cared about
was walking with the Gods.

16:23.610 --> 16:26.612
It's different this time.
I'm different.

16:26.647 --> 16:28.447
I have Peter.

16:31.485 --> 16:36.456
He won't let me
become that man again.

16:42.563 --> 16:45.432
Hastings, give Dr. Bishop
anything he wants.

16:47.869 --> 16:50.671
Yes, <i>that</i> Dr. Bishop.

16:50.705 --> 16:53.140
Well,
it would be an honor.

17:06.321 --> 17:08.757
<i>There must be some variable</i>
<i>you're forgetting.</i>

17:08.790 --> 17:11.292
<i>Tell me exactly what you saw--</i>
<i>every single detail.</i>

17:11.327 --> 17:13.061
The baldie was sitting
on the bench,

17:13.096 --> 17:14.329
writing in his notebook.

17:14.364 --> 17:15.964
Did he interact with anyone
in the park?

17:15.999 --> 17:18.634
No, not that I saw.
Did you see a little girl?

17:18.669 --> 17:20.670
She would have been playing
with a yellow ball

17:20.704 --> 17:22.204
in front of the bench
Royce was sitting on.

17:22.239 --> 17:24.307
How could you know that?

17:24.340 --> 17:25.708
Royce was supposed
to be distracted

17:25.742 --> 17:27.710
by the kid playing
as he stood to get up.

17:27.743 --> 17:29.411
He was going to forget
his briefcase.

17:29.446 --> 17:31.580
No, Royce wasn't paying
attention to any kid.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.182
He was talking
on his comm.

17:33.216 --> 17:35.251
He was on his comm?
Yeah.

17:35.285 --> 17:36.852
I was too far away
to hear anything.

17:36.886 --> 17:39.221
He stood up, grabbed
his briefcase, and walked away.

17:39.255 --> 17:40.956
That's it.

17:40.990 --> 17:44.626
That's what?
The variable.

17:44.661 --> 17:47.129
The one thing that I failed
to see--Royce on his comm.

17:47.163 --> 17:48.530
Peter, what are you
talking about?

17:48.564 --> 17:50.799
He's going
to the restaurant next.

17:56.105 --> 17:57.039
Give me the briefcase.

17:57.073 --> 17:59.308
I'll switch it there.

17:59.342 --> 18:01.143
I know that you have
questions, Anil,

18:01.177 --> 18:03.412
but I'm just gonna have
to ask you to trust me.

18:03.446 --> 18:05.481
What's this?
An address.

18:05.515 --> 18:08.150
Go there,
and wait outside.

18:08.185 --> 18:10.520
This is a Baldie precinct.

18:10.554 --> 18:13.089
At exactly 6:17, Royce and
another Observer named Mueller

18:13.123 --> 18:14.624
will walk into that building.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.725
Call me when they do.

18:20.697 --> 18:22.097
I'll comm you
when they show.

18:22.132 --> 18:24.367
Thank you.

18:29.340 --> 18:31.341
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

18:31.375 --> 18:33.978
<i>Who told you that?</i>

18:34.012 --> 18:35.680
<i>I'll talk to Harris about it,</i>
<i>but--</i>

18:35.714 --> 18:39.383
<i>Just farther down the street.</i>

18:39.418 --> 18:40.818
<i>To the left?</i>

18:40.852 --> 18:42.886
<i>Great.</i>
<i>I'll meet you over there.</i>

18:42.920 --> 18:44.021
<i>Want to take a look at it?</i>

18:50.929 --> 18:53.664
<i>What else are you going to do?</i>

18:53.698 --> 18:54.865
<i>Yeah, let's hope</i>
<i>that it's not problematic.</i>

18:54.900 --> 18:58.936
<i>Right.</i>

19:03.541 --> 19:04.842
<i>Yeah, I'll be seeing you.</i>

19:04.876 --> 19:07.411
<i>You did a great job.</i>

19:27.781 --> 19:28.848
I'd like to check this.

19:28.883 --> 19:30.483
Sure.

19:30.518 --> 19:33.520
I haven't seen you
in here before.

19:33.554 --> 19:35.221
It's not really
my crowd.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.028
You better be careful.

19:41.525 --> 19:43.693
You don't want
to get read.

19:43.727 --> 19:45.594
You should get that.

19:49.933 --> 19:54.869
Old trick.

19:54.904 --> 19:56.471
<i>Anything else?</i>

19:56.505 --> 20:00.508
<i>Would you like some more water?</i>

20:13.957 --> 20:16.425
<i>How are you</i>
<i>and Peter doing?</i>

20:21.231 --> 20:23.765
Peter doesn't sleep.

20:24.173 --> 20:26.808
He leaves the lab
at all these odd hours.

20:26.842 --> 20:28.442
And when he gets back,

20:28.477 --> 20:30.478
and I ask him
where he's been,

20:30.512 --> 20:33.581
he's always got
an explanation that--

20:33.616 --> 20:35.617
that makes sense.

20:35.651 --> 20:39.154
But...

20:39.188 --> 20:42.657
I just think there's
something he's not telling me.

20:42.691 --> 20:44.826
I can feel it.

20:44.860 --> 20:48.363
Well, he's been
through a lot.

20:48.397 --> 20:51.232
I mean, you both have.
Yeah.

20:51.266 --> 20:55.436
<i>I'm not defending Peter.</i>

20:55.470 --> 20:58.372
<i>I saw how isolated</i>
<i>he made himself</i>

20:58.407 --> 21:01.509
<i>after Etta went missing</i>
<i>in the invasion.</i>

21:01.543 --> 21:04.912
I would say that,
compared to that,

21:04.946 --> 21:08.382
he has come
a long way.

21:08.416 --> 21:11.585
I keep telling myself
that this time we're stronger.

21:14.089 --> 21:16.657
But I'm--

21:16.692 --> 21:20.928
I'm worried that...

21:20.963 --> 21:23.297
I'm losing him again.

21:34.677 --> 21:39.581
<i>That is my understanding.</i>

21:39.616 --> 21:41.917
Three.

21:41.952 --> 21:46.422
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:46.457 --> 21:50.093
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>there's need to ask for more.</i>

21:52.330 --> 21:54.665
<i>I find it displeasing.</i>

21:57.568 --> 21:59.637
<i>Um, just the special, sir.</i>

21:59.671 --> 22:01.105
<i>Would you like it?</i>

22:04.042 --> 22:10.014
♪ ♪

22:12.551 --> 22:15.152
Hello.
Cavatina.

22:15.186 --> 22:17.755
I'm at work, Ronny.

22:17.789 --> 22:19.423
Can we talk
about this later?

22:19.457 --> 22:22.926
Because unlike you,
I have a job.

22:27.831 --> 22:30.600
This baby has an event radius
of up to 1,000 meters.

22:30.634 --> 22:32.034
These rods,
they mark the boundaries

22:32.069 --> 22:33.736
of whatever area
you want to sublimate.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.271
What's this?
Don't touch that!

22:36.306 --> 22:39.475
I haven't even showed you
the power-up sequence yet.

22:39.509 --> 22:41.276
You see
this light here?

22:41.311 --> 22:42.778
It turns yellow,
you're good.

22:42.812 --> 22:45.247
But blue, that means
the fission core is overheating.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.683
That's a common design flaw
in these Gen One models.

22:47.717 --> 22:51.654
Blue... means run.

22:52.656 --> 22:54.090
Okay.

22:54.124 --> 22:56.192
I'm worried
about you, Walter.

22:56.226 --> 23:00.330
What you said earlier--
that Peter would keep you

23:00.364 --> 23:03.166
from becoming the man
you used to be.

23:03.200 --> 23:07.237
I'm not sure
that's enough.

23:07.271 --> 23:10.306
<i>I knew the man you were--</i>
<i>you and William.</i>

23:10.341 --> 23:12.509
<i>You both tested</i>
<i>the limits of science,</i>

23:12.543 --> 23:14.644
<i>of the universe.</i>

23:14.678 --> 23:17.281
You felt
that boundless power

23:17.315 --> 23:21.519
that comes
with omnipotence.

23:21.553 --> 23:24.723
You felt what it was like
to be God.

23:28.361 --> 23:30.195
You don't need
to remind me, Nina.

23:30.229 --> 23:32.531
I was there.

23:32.566 --> 23:38.103
Then you should know how hard
I tried to hold on to William.

23:38.138 --> 23:41.140
How much I loved him.

23:41.174 --> 23:42.908
But that wasn't enough.

23:42.942 --> 23:46.078
I wasn't enough.

23:46.113 --> 23:48.514
Because nothing can compare
to that feeling--

23:48.548 --> 23:50.783
to that kind of power.

23:52.453 --> 23:56.055
So he let me go.

23:56.090 --> 23:58.258
The reason
you couldn't hold onto him

23:58.292 --> 24:01.228
is because he
never loved you.

24:04.498 --> 24:08.402
He never loved anyone
except himself.

24:08.436 --> 24:11.638
I've been fooled by him
too many times

24:11.672 --> 24:13.540
to think anything else.

24:13.574 --> 24:18.111
I know better,
and so should you.

24:20.748 --> 24:24.818
You asked me before
if I saw him in you.

24:24.852 --> 24:28.722
I just did.

24:28.756 --> 24:33.193
<i>The Walter I know would never</i>
<i>say anything so cruel.</i>

24:33.227 --> 24:35.195
<i>But the Walter who lay</i>
<i>on an operating table</i>

24:35.229 --> 24:36.696
<i>in William's laboratory,</i>

24:36.731 --> 24:39.232
begging to have pieces
of his brain removed,

24:39.267 --> 24:41.334
for fear of what
he would become,

24:41.369 --> 24:43.669
he would.

24:45.439 --> 24:47.273
I've come
a long way.

24:47.308 --> 24:49.576
I love my son,
he loves me.

24:49.610 --> 24:52.579
That will save me.

24:56.450 --> 24:59.920
For your sake,
I hope that's true.

25:01.389 --> 25:04.458
Walter... we're ready.

25:04.492 --> 25:06.860
Oh, there's one other thing
that you should know.

25:06.895 --> 25:09.163
The Observers analyze
any change in the atmosphere,

25:09.197 --> 25:10.831
so once you utilize
the technology,

25:10.866 --> 25:12.466
they will respond
within minutes.

25:12.500 --> 25:15.535
Okay. Then we'll have
to be quick.

25:15.570 --> 25:17.471
Thank you, Nina.

25:21.209 --> 25:23.477
Good luck.

25:34.589 --> 25:35.689
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:35.723 --> 25:38.458
<i>Let me know.</i>

25:38.492 --> 25:39.459
<i>The same time frame.</i>

25:39.494 --> 25:40.561
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:40.595 --> 25:42.096
<i>Oh, good.</i>

25:42.130 --> 25:44.698
<i>Yeah, we'll get it organized.</i>

25:44.733 --> 25:46.100
<i>Okay, you're all set then.</i>

25:46.134 --> 25:49.136
<i>Thanks so much.</i>

25:53.341 --> 25:55.075
<i>Go over it as needed.</i>

25:55.110 --> 25:58.779
<i>That's my understanding.</i>

25:58.813 --> 25:59.813
<i>Are you heading downtown?</i>

25:59.848 --> 26:01.649
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:01.683 --> 26:03.250
<i>>All right,</i>
<i>why don't we ride together?</i>

26:03.285 --> 26:04.952
<i>Sir, these came down for you.</i>

26:04.986 --> 26:06.520
<i>We might have to go</i>
<i>into the server</i>

26:06.555 --> 26:08.589
<i>and see what kind of code</i>
<i>they used.</i>

26:08.623 --> 26:11.759
<i>I'll send a messenger</i>
<i>over with it.</i>

26:11.793 --> 26:15.130
<i>All right, as long</i>
<i>as they're both marked urgent.</i>

26:15.164 --> 26:17.699
<i>Hernandez rescheduled.</i>

26:58.251 --> 27:00.138
Is that ready, dear?

27:00.418 --> 27:02.433
Well, come on down
and set this one for me.

27:19.136 --> 27:20.870
Hello?

27:20.904 --> 27:24.273
You managed to switch
the briefcase.

27:24.308 --> 27:25.241
What happened?

27:25.275 --> 27:27.209
It was a success.

27:27.244 --> 27:29.378
<i>This place is crawling</i>
<i>with Baldies.</i>

27:29.413 --> 27:31.781
Go home, Anil.
I'll contact you.

27:38.312 --> 27:39.979
So what did Anil want?

27:39.980 --> 27:42.815
I waited for him for
over an hour--he didn't show.

27:42.850 --> 27:44.316
That was him calling
to let me know

27:44.351 --> 27:46.385
that he got stopped
at a checkpoint.

27:46.419 --> 27:49.755
Did he tell you
why he wanted to meet?

27:49.789 --> 27:52.191
No.

27:52.225 --> 27:57.229
Olivia, Peter,
we're ready.

27:57.263 --> 27:59.564
So what do we have?

27:59.599 --> 28:02.033

Walter?

30:00.188 --> 30:03.556
My Bowie...
He stole it.

30:03.591 --> 30:05.158
It's not enough
that he institutionalized me,

30:05.192 --> 30:06.660
betrayed our friendship,

30:06.694 --> 30:08.695

Of course.

30:37.425 --> 30:39.726
Belly used the same
combination for everything.

30:39.761 --> 30:41.461
He had
a terrible memory.

30:41.496 --> 30:45.399

Peter, where are you going?
I'll take my car.

Olivia, before we go back

a stop first.

Nina.

Walter.
Did everything go okay?

34:12.375 --> 34:14.643
<i>Yes.</i>

34:14.677 --> 34:16.710

worked.

We have
the cylinders.

34:18.313 --> 34:20.782
Good.

34:20.815 --> 34:24.418
Why did you want
to see me?

34:27.222 --> 34:29.422
I asked Olivia
to bring me back

34:29.456 --> 34:31.225
because I wanted
to give you this.

34:39.100 --> 34:41.266
It was

34:43.838 --> 34:45.906
I was wrong.

34:45.940 --> 34:48.842
He did love you.

34:52.013 --> 34:54.949
And it wasn't enough.

34:57.286 --> 34:58.753
No...

34:58.787 --> 35:04.626
I'm scared, Nina.

35:04.660 --> 35:07.562
Every day that goes by,
I feel him

35:07.596 --> 35:10.799
more and more.

35:10.833 --> 35:14.235
I'm losing myself.

35:14.269 --> 35:16.137
I'm becoming the man
I was.

35:16.171 --> 35:18.940
And just like before,
everyone that I care about

35:18.974 --> 35:20.442
will be driven away

35:20.476 --> 35:24.880
and will suffer
because of me.

35:24.914 --> 35:27.549
I need you

35:29.485 --> 35:31.586

35:31.620 --> 35:34.422
My intellect may be
diminished slightly,

35:34.456 --> 35:36.958

I've become.

35:39.695 --> 35:42.663
