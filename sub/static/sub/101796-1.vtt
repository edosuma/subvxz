WEBVTT

00:26.886 --> 00:29.221
<i>Look everyone knows
how important you are</i>

00:29.254 --> 00:30.823
<i>to this team.</i>

00:30.857 --> 00:32.491
<i>You're making this
a bigger deal than it is.</i>

00:32.524 --> 00:33.960
<i>I saw all of the slides.</i>

00:33.993 --> 00:36.561
<i>I like Steven's idea best,
period.</i>

00:36.595 --> 00:38.463
No way, Nils, come on.

00:38.497 --> 00:39.899
<i>It's fresh.</i>

00:39.932 --> 00:41.600
<i>He's taking
the established theme,</i>

00:41.634 --> 00:43.803
<i>tipping it on its head.
Brilliant!</i>

00:43.836 --> 00:47.205
<i>It takes the mascot thing
to a new and younger audience.</i>

00:47.239 --> 00:49.241
It's offensive.

00:49.274 --> 00:51.209
You, you shouldn't even
have had eyes on it.

00:51.243 --> 00:52.544
<i>Oh, loosen up, Frank.</i>

00:52.577 --> 00:54.814
<i>Urban Sammy is hilarious.</i>

00:54.847 --> 00:58.216
My client's going to hate it.
I'm telling you.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.820
<i>It's the agency's client,
not yours.</i>

01:00.853 --> 01:03.622
That client chose
this agency because of me.

01:03.656 --> 01:05.658
<i>They asked us to rebrand, Frank.</i>

01:05.692 --> 01:07.526
<i>They want to shake things up.</i>

01:07.559 --> 01:10.763
<i>I brought Steven in to do that,
he's very talented.</i>

01:10.797 --> 01:12.464
<i>He's got a goddamn Grand Prix.</i>

01:12.497 --> 01:14.332
Oh, I don't care.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.636
A bad idea is a bad idea.

01:16.669 --> 01:19.237
Well, I'm having him present it.

01:19.271 --> 01:20.840
- <i>I have to go.</i>
- No, no, wait.

01:22.809 --> 01:24.777
Hey,
I have the new rendering here

01:24.811 --> 01:28.014
and I stuck
the keynote on this drive

01:28.047 --> 01:29.916
and all the digital
stuff is hyper-linked.

01:29.949 --> 01:31.784
There's no need.

01:31.818 --> 01:35.387
Steven went behind my back
and showed Nils Urban Sammy.

01:35.420 --> 01:36.789
No.

01:36.823 --> 01:38.523
No way,
I thought you killed that idea.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.793
Yeah, that little shit bag
went over my head.

01:40.827 --> 01:42.327
But the new deck is so good.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.696
What about your work?

01:43.730 --> 01:45.631
- Our work.
- But can he do that?

01:45.665 --> 01:46.598
I mean, the...

01:48.668 --> 01:49.836
Man, that's the worst.

01:49.869 --> 01:51.704
Yeah, I just got off with Nils

01:51.738 --> 01:53.538
and it's done, Ruby.

01:54.874 --> 01:55.808
Nils sucks.

01:56.943 --> 01:58.745
He doesn't have
a creative bone in his body.

01:59.779 --> 02:02.280
And there's not a lot
we can do about it.

02:02.314 --> 02:04.884
When the chief creative
officer makes a decision,

02:04.917 --> 02:06.853
that's what goes.

02:06.886 --> 02:10.022
- Just stick your stuff on my desk.
- Yeah.

02:14.326 --> 02:15.895
Hey, are you okay?

02:17.529 --> 02:18.965
Yeah.

02:18.998 --> 02:20.867
Next time.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.567
We'll get them next time.

02:22.601 --> 02:23.568
Okay.

02:24.971 --> 02:26.839
I have got to go clear my head.

02:27.740 --> 02:29.574
Oh, um.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.375
- Here.
- Oh.

02:31.543 --> 02:34.981
- What's this?
- It's a card I made.

02:35.014 --> 02:36.783
Don't, like,
open it in front of me.

02:36.816 --> 02:38.483
You got it.

02:38.517 --> 02:39.819
I leave for Nebraska on Monday.

02:39.852 --> 02:40.987
I won't see you
before the holidays,

02:41.020 --> 02:42.989
so Merry Christmas.

02:43.022 --> 02:44.757
And screw Nils.

02:44.791 --> 02:46.759
And Steven.

02:46.793 --> 02:49.061
They're both hacks,
everybody here knows it.

02:50.630 --> 02:51.831
Thanks for that.

02:51.864 --> 02:53.065
Are you going to be okay?

02:54.000 --> 02:54.901
Yeah.

02:54.934 --> 02:56.769
I'll be fine.

02:56.803 --> 03:00.072
As long as I don't run
into the fucking turncoat.

03:00.106 --> 03:03.475
Then, you, uh, you better go now.

03:03.508 --> 03:05.610
- He's leaving the conference room, he's headed this way.
- Oh, okay.

03:05.645 --> 03:07.847
Hey, Steven,
I had a question for you.

04:36.135 --> 04:37.203
Yeah?

04:37.236 --> 04:38.971
<i>Hey, Frankie.</i>

04:39.005 --> 04:40.640
<i>You ran off on me, my man.</i>

04:40.673 --> 04:42.607
<i>You okay with those changes?</i>

04:42.642 --> 04:43.743
You know that I'm not.

04:43.776 --> 04:45.678
You went behind my back.

04:45.711 --> 04:47.713
<i>I had to make a snap decision.</i>

04:47.747 --> 04:50.049
<i>Look, I know you've been close
to this account, Frankie.</i>

04:50.082 --> 04:52.584
Oh, yeah, the account I've been
running for the last decade.

04:52.617 --> 04:54.053
Yeah, yeah, pretty close to it.

04:54.086 --> 04:56.756
<i>We needed fresh eyes,
something new.</i>

04:56.789 --> 04:58.691
<i>We're pushing
the creative forward.</i>

04:58.724 --> 05:00.059
"Pushing the creative."

05:00.092 --> 05:01.994
You know how dumb
that sounds, right?

05:02.028 --> 05:03.729
<i>Well, Nils loves my idea.</i>

05:03.763 --> 05:05.231
Nils isn't the client.

05:05.264 --> 05:08.234
<i>Yeah, but guess what,
he's our boss.</i>

05:08.267 --> 05:10.568
Now, look,
we're supposed to be partners.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.171
You needed to trust me.

05:12.204 --> 05:15.942
<i>Frankie, your thinking
is just so '80s, man.</i>

05:15.975 --> 05:17.843
<i>Brands don't act the same way.
You'll see,</i>

05:17.877 --> 05:19.611
<i>the clients
are going to love it.</i>

05:19.645 --> 05:21.881
Yeah, well,
I hope for both of us they do.

06:40.092 --> 06:41.593
Let's go a little deeper.

06:43.295 --> 06:44.529
Deeper.

06:45.297 --> 06:46.899
Now really stretch.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.668
Are you hurting?

06:49.702 --> 06:50.736
Yeah.

06:51.904 --> 06:53.005
Okay, bud.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.208
Let's try something different.

06:56.242 --> 06:57.843
Twists.

06:57.877 --> 06:59.145
- Okay.
- Yeah, how's your shoulder?

06:59.178 --> 07:00.846
Well, shitty, as usual.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.214
Yeah?

07:02.248 --> 07:03.716
I want you to push through,
all right?

07:04.850 --> 07:05.785
Hold on to that.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.553
Grab that.

07:09.688 --> 07:10.756
Okay?

07:11.690 --> 07:13.025
Ready?

07:19.832 --> 07:22.368
How's Kath been doing these days?
I haven't seen her in a while.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.936
She's doing fine.

07:25.204 --> 07:27.106
Okay, granny, few more reps.

07:29.675 --> 07:31.644
You're tougher than this.

07:31.677 --> 07:32.778
Push through.

07:34.180 --> 07:36.015
Kathy can pull harder than this.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.753
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.256
You know,
look what you've made me do.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.300
Mm, smells amazing, baby.

08:28.334 --> 08:31.070
- Thanks, baby.
- Aw, babies,

08:31.103 --> 08:33.873
can refrain from using
foreplay at the table?

08:33.906 --> 08:34.874
Jealous?

08:36.108 --> 08:37.843
God.

08:39.745 --> 08:41.914
Why are we using
Grandma's death plates?

08:41.947 --> 08:44.817
- China.
- Sorry, death China.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.952
Why are we using
Grandma's death China?

08:46.986 --> 08:48.787
It's a special occasion.

08:48.821 --> 08:51.857
You use China
on special occasions.

08:51.891 --> 08:53.159
What's the special occasion?

08:53.192 --> 08:55.294
Mom and Dad's anniversary.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.696
Jesus, Kaitlin,
I texted you that last night.

08:57.730 --> 09:01.167
Uh, I was, how do you say,
un-petit fucked up last night.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.835
I love these plates,
you don't like them?

09:02.868 --> 09:04.904
No. They're old and creepy

09:04.937 --> 09:06.772
and I'm afraid I'm going
to constantly break them.

09:06.805 --> 09:09.175
It's our connection
to your grandma.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.809
And your grandma's grandma.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.144
Thank you.

09:12.178 --> 09:14.380
Through the use
of their old-ass plates?

09:14.413 --> 09:16.148
I think they're beautiful, Mom.

09:16.182 --> 09:17.750
Agreed. So pretty.

09:19.084 --> 09:20.085
Oh, my God.

09:25.191 --> 09:28.194
God, the Andersons
have made me hate Christmas.

09:28.227 --> 09:29.862
- Be nice.
- Oh,

09:29.895 --> 09:31.797
Mrs. Anderson's
probably beside herself

09:31.830 --> 09:33.432
that it's 60 degrees
in December.

09:33.465 --> 09:35.901
She does love snow, that woman.

09:35.935 --> 09:37.336
Oh.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.004
I want to take that speaker

09:39.038 --> 09:40.940
and shove it right up
her little, tiny ass.

09:42.474 --> 09:44.443
- Seems like a strong reaction.
- Sorry.

09:44.476 --> 09:46.512
Tell me this doesn't annoy
the shit out of you.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.047
It does. It doesn't make me

09:48.080 --> 09:49.782
want to sodomize my neighbor.

09:49.815 --> 09:51.250
Mom, don't say "sodomize."

09:51.283 --> 09:52.418
Why?

09:52.451 --> 09:53.986
Because we're about to eat.

09:54.019 --> 09:56.188
Oh, loosen up, Sadie,
for all of us.

09:56.222 --> 09:57.389
I'm super loose.

09:57.423 --> 09:59.158
Ha.

09:59.191 --> 10:00.159
Where's Dad?

10:00.192 --> 10:01.827
He had a pitch today.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.229
New take on the squirrel.

10:03.262 --> 10:05.130
Oh, no, they're changing Sammy?

10:05.164 --> 10:08.033
They're trying to make him
more relevant for Millennials.

10:08.067 --> 10:09.835
Millennials don't give
a shit what cartoon

10:09.868 --> 10:11.203
character's
on their toilet paper.

10:11.237 --> 10:13.072
Mm, I disagree.

10:13.105 --> 10:14.440
I use the one
with the bear on it.

10:15.941 --> 10:17.109
You know, it comforts me.

10:19.545 --> 10:21.080
Help me baste, hun.

10:21.113 --> 10:22.181
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

10:24.149 --> 10:25.884
Thank you.

10:25.918 --> 10:26.819
Watch it.

10:30.522 --> 10:33.325
That boy is more whupped
than any man I know.

10:33.359 --> 10:34.526
Like a puppy.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.395
That's how she like them though.

10:36.428 --> 10:37.896
Well, everybody's got something,
don't they?

10:37.930 --> 10:40.366
Oh, Mom, getting catty.

10:40.399 --> 10:42.468
Meow.

10:42.501 --> 10:44.336
Hey, help me set.

10:46.405 --> 10:47.439
These are pretty.

10:47.473 --> 10:49.108
Like the bit at the bottom.

10:49.141 --> 10:52.044
Yeah, it's a bitch to clean but,
yeah.

10:52.077 --> 10:54.580
Your father's aunt gave
these to us for our wedding.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.482
How do you remember
shit like that?

10:56.515 --> 10:58.284
You know, that's my brain,
a steel trap.

11:00.386 --> 11:01.520
I'm glad you're here.

11:01.553 --> 11:03.088
It means a lot to me.

11:03.122 --> 11:04.290
Don't go all Hallmark on me.

11:04.323 --> 11:05.557
I didn't even get you a gift.

11:05.591 --> 11:09.261
Your presence is
the only present I need.

11:09.295 --> 11:10.996
Barf, Ma.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.031
I know.

11:12.064 --> 11:12.965
Deal with it.

11:16.502 --> 11:18.237
Uh, and set a place for Danny.

11:18.270 --> 11:19.305
Please.

11:19.338 --> 11:22.007
Ma, that's fucking morbid.

11:25.878 --> 11:26.879
Do it.

11:52.104 --> 11:53.405
Fuck me.

12:19.131 --> 12:22.134
Oh, fuck you, Santa.

12:38.517 --> 12:40.653
Hey, would you rather have this,
lady?

12:40.687 --> 12:41.954
It's all herbal.

13:15.722 --> 13:17.489
I hate you very much.

13:17.523 --> 13:20.592
Oh.

13:20.627 --> 13:22.594
You're fucking crazy.

13:34.506 --> 13:38.310
- You asshole, give me this.
- Hey.

13:38.343 --> 13:40.446
I am doing you
a solid right now.

13:40.479 --> 13:41.980
- Oh, is she pissed?
- Mm.

13:43.081 --> 13:44.983
She's mildly miffed
at this point.

13:45.017 --> 13:47.553
Just go in,
make a big deal out of her.

13:47.586 --> 13:51.056
Um, oh, give me your card
and I'll get her something.

13:51.089 --> 13:53.158
Get her a massage
from my trainer.

13:53.192 --> 13:54.993
- With Ray?
- Yeah.

13:55.027 --> 13:56.663
Yeah, she'll love it.

13:56.696 --> 13:58.330
Okay, done and done.

13:59.431 --> 14:00.399
You're a champion.

14:00.432 --> 14:02.234
Okay, goober, go.

14:05.504 --> 14:06.472
Ah.

14:08.073 --> 14:10.476
Danny always liked
the lights on before dinner.

14:20.653 --> 14:23.155
Hey, happy anniversary, sir.

14:23.188 --> 14:25.257
Patty, I wasn't expecting you.

14:25.290 --> 14:27.025
Happy to be here, sir, honored.

14:27.059 --> 14:29.094
All right, at ease, Patty.
Okay, enough

14:29.127 --> 14:31.296
with the "sirs." We get it.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.665
You got something for Mom,
right?

14:32.699 --> 14:35.100
Yes, kid, of course I did.

14:35.133 --> 14:39.238
Where's
my beautiful wife of 20...

14:39.271 --> 14:40.740
- Eight.
- ...eight years?

14:40.773 --> 14:42.307
Jesus.

14:42.341 --> 14:44.176
Has it been 28 years already?

14:44.209 --> 14:46.545
- Yes, it has.
- Oh.

14:46.578 --> 14:48.046
You reek of weed, honey.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.515
Yeah, stressful day.

14:49.548 --> 14:52.351
- I don't want you driving high.
- You do it.

14:52.384 --> 14:55.087
Yeah, but I handle that shit
a lot better than you do.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.623
Guys, can we not talk about drugs
at the dinner table? We have guests.

14:57.657 --> 14:59.124
Uh, no, I, I don't mind it.

14:59.157 --> 15:00.727
See, Patty doesn't mind.

15:06.766 --> 15:07.767
Death plates.

15:10.235 --> 15:11.436
What?

15:11.470 --> 15:12.639
Red or white?

15:12.672 --> 15:14.540
- Red.
- Me too.

15:14.573 --> 15:17.777
- Bourbon, two cubs, dash bitters.
- Go fix it yourself.

15:17.810 --> 15:20.546
I thought you liked playing
hostess with the mostess.

15:20.579 --> 15:22.849
- Katy.
- What?

15:22.882 --> 15:25.350
I'll, uh, I'll actually
take one as well, Kaitlin.

15:25.384 --> 15:26.753
I didn't offer.

15:27.654 --> 15:29.354
All right, um.

15:29.388 --> 15:30.857
No, no, fill it up, sweetheart.

15:30.890 --> 15:33.225
You know what,
I will go make my own.

15:35.193 --> 15:36.094
Okay.

15:37.630 --> 15:38.831
You guys should go away.

15:38.865 --> 15:41.300
Take a cruise or something.

15:41.333 --> 15:42.568
Like old people?

15:43.602 --> 15:46.338
Well, 28 years seems big.

15:46.371 --> 15:48.741
- Like a thing to be celebrated.
- Oh, you know, my folks

15:48.775 --> 15:51.310
went to Turks and Caicos
this year. Loved it.

15:51.343 --> 15:53.312
I can get the name of their
travel agent if you'd like.

15:53.345 --> 15:54.546
People still use those?

15:54.580 --> 15:55.815
Oh, yeah, my parents do.

15:55.848 --> 15:58.183
Oh.

15:58.216 --> 16:00.519
Don't you think so, Kaitlin?
They should take a trip or something.

16:00.552 --> 16:01.620
Mm.

16:01.654 --> 16:02.689
For what?

16:02.722 --> 16:03.856
Will you pass the potatoes?

16:03.890 --> 16:05.424
Their anniversary.

16:05.457 --> 16:06.391
Uh...

16:06.425 --> 16:07.894
Sure.

16:07.927 --> 16:08.861
Roll, please.

16:10.228 --> 16:11.898
Is that what you want? A trip?

16:11.931 --> 16:14.701
No, I want my own sports car.

16:14.734 --> 16:16.869
Like a little
Vespa or something.

16:16.903 --> 16:18.771
Having a midlife crisis.

16:18.805 --> 16:20.873
Mm. No.

16:20.907 --> 16:22.474
I'm just trying to keep up
with yours, hon.

16:22.507 --> 16:23.876
Oh!

16:23.910 --> 16:26.511
Momma's on fire tonight.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.848
I was going to wait
until after dinner,

16:28.881 --> 16:30.717
but I can't wait anymore.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.185
I made you guys
a little something.

16:33.218 --> 16:35.220
- Oh.
- Jesus, Sadie.

16:35.253 --> 16:37.623
That's so, so nice.

16:37.657 --> 16:39.157
It's your lives together.

16:39.191 --> 16:40.693
Like almost every detail.

16:42.729 --> 16:43.663
Open it.

16:43.696 --> 16:45.430
What... wa... right now?

16:45.464 --> 16:46.933
- I was going to start dinner.
- Yes!

16:46.966 --> 16:48.935
Oh, my gosh, okay.

16:48.968 --> 16:50.637
So I wanted the first picture
to be that one

16:50.670 --> 16:52.872
from Christmas last year with,
with all of us,

16:52.905 --> 16:54.907
but I couldn't find it, so...

16:54.941 --> 16:58.243
I have looked everywhere
for that damn picture.

16:58.276 --> 17:01.179
No worries,
I went old school instead.

17:01.213 --> 17:02.682
Oh, wow.

17:02.715 --> 17:03.916
- Look.
- Oh,

17:03.950 --> 17:05.852
look how much hair I had.

17:05.885 --> 17:08.487
- Oh!
- Oh, look at that stash.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.856
Oh, Christ.

17:09.889 --> 17:11.891
Oh, man, it was the '80s.

17:11.924 --> 17:13.191
Katy, you want to look?

17:13.225 --> 17:15.460
At Dad's pedophile stash?

17:15.494 --> 17:17.897
Nah. Hard pass on that one.

17:17.930 --> 17:20.198
Uh, can I have that,
I'd love to see that, actually.

17:20.232 --> 17:21.801
- Wait a second.
- Hello?

17:21.834 --> 17:24.804
Whoa, Ma, nice jugs!

17:24.837 --> 17:26.304
Don't be gross.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.373
Oh,
there's nothing gross with that.

17:28.407 --> 17:29.842
Where was that? Italy.

17:29.876 --> 17:31.510
<i>Si, si.</i>

17:31.543 --> 17:34.546
That was the afternoon
we drank Aperol spritzers

17:34.579 --> 17:35.848
in that little cafe.

17:35.882 --> 17:38.250
Ma, are you drunkies
in this picture?

17:38.283 --> 17:39.618
Yeah, certain.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.755
Katy,
what'd you get for Mom and Dad?

17:42.789 --> 17:46.358
My unwavering love and support.

17:46.391 --> 17:47.894
The greatest gift of all.

17:47.927 --> 17:49.361
So, nothing.

17:50.697 --> 17:53.900
Mom, Dad got you
a massage with his trainer.

17:53.933 --> 17:54.967
Really?

17:55.001 --> 17:56.501
Wow.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.570
Thanks, hun.

17:58.603 --> 18:00.605
That'll be nice.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.841
Anything for you.

18:01.874 --> 18:02.775
Maybe I'll go Sunday.

18:02.809 --> 18:04.476
Go tomorrow.

18:04.509 --> 18:05.845
Oh, no, tomorrow's the shower.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.747
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh, God!

18:07.780 --> 18:09.949
I don't have to, like,
go to that, right?

18:09.982 --> 18:11.684
- You both certainly do.
- Can't you

18:11.718 --> 18:13.318
tell them I have diarrhea?

18:13.351 --> 18:14.987
No one questions diarrhea.

18:15.021 --> 18:16.689
Yeah, I have diarrhea too.

18:16.723 --> 18:18.490
Lots of it. I mean,

18:18.523 --> 18:19.692
when did men start having

18:19.726 --> 18:20.927
to go to these things anyway?

18:20.960 --> 18:22.427
You're going.

18:32.370 --> 18:33.472
Sir.

18:34.473 --> 18:37.609
For Christ sake,
you don't need to call me sir!

18:37.643 --> 18:39.712
Duly noted. Um.
There's something

18:39.746 --> 18:41.848
I wanted to talk to you about,
sir. Something...

18:43.415 --> 18:45.952
Something important. Um.

18:45.985 --> 18:46.853
Okay.

18:55.928 --> 18:58.263
Spit it out, man.

18:59.832 --> 19:02.635
I'm going to ask
Sadie for her hand...

19:04.704 --> 19:08.473
and I'd very much like
your blessing, sir.

19:15.114 --> 19:16.448
Sure.

19:18.483 --> 19:19.819
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

19:19.852 --> 19:20.953
Thank you.

19:43.976 --> 19:45.011
Kath!

19:45.978 --> 19:47.379
Kathy!

19:48.648 --> 19:51.383
I thought we agreed we weren't
going to buy this toilet paper!

19:52.151 --> 19:55.087
I look at this fucking squirrel
enough during my work week!

19:56.689 --> 19:58.390
Sorry, it was on sale.

20:00.026 --> 20:02.360
The count is under review again.

20:03.095 --> 20:04.462
It's humiliating.

20:06.032 --> 20:07.767
Pitching like a fucking rookie.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.569
Isn't Steven
supposed to be working

20:10.602 --> 20:11.971
with you on this one?

20:12.004 --> 20:13.371
Yeah.

20:13.405 --> 20:14.674
Little asshole.

20:15.942 --> 20:18.878
Time for the wunderkind
to prove himself, right?

20:18.911 --> 20:20.880
Nah, he's fucking it all up.

20:20.913 --> 20:23.082
Client's going to hate the deck.

20:23.115 --> 20:24.817
So? Stick up for yourself

20:24.851 --> 20:26.719
and your work.

20:26.752 --> 20:28.587
Christ, we thought up
that damn squirrel

20:28.620 --> 20:29.889
however many years ago.

20:31.556 --> 20:33.425
You know the brand
better than anyone.

20:35.194 --> 20:36.762
They don't care, Kath.

20:37.997 --> 20:39.899
You were smart
to get out when you did.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.435
I'm the old fart there.

20:43.468 --> 20:45.972
You know,
and they are just waiting,

20:46.005 --> 20:49.075
looking for, uh,
any excuse to get rid of me.

20:49.108 --> 20:50.142
I can feel it.

20:55.715 --> 20:57.582
Stop being nice to these pricks.

20:59.752 --> 21:03.089
This is your client. You should
threaten little Steven.

21:03.122 --> 21:04.757
Take Sammy
the Squirrel elsewhere.

21:06.926 --> 21:08.526
Hmm.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.730
I like
when you're talking tough.

21:10.763 --> 21:11.764
Sexy.

21:13.099 --> 21:14.700
What did you do?

21:16.168 --> 21:17.670
I read an article.

21:19.672 --> 21:21.741
It's supposed
to make it look bigger.

21:29.715 --> 21:31.616
Oh, God.

21:31.651 --> 21:33.653
Do I really have
to come tomorrow?

21:33.686 --> 21:35.587
Yes, you have to come.

21:35.620 --> 21:38.824
She's my only niece and,
come on, she's not that bad.

21:42.161 --> 21:43.229
I got too excited!

21:43.262 --> 21:44.730
Oh, my God! Who,

21:44.764 --> 21:46.032
who gave me this one?

21:46.065 --> 21:47.800
Okay, what's next?

21:47.833 --> 21:50.136
From you guys? Oh, coasters!

21:50.169 --> 21:52.772
Oh, my God, I love coasters!

21:52.805 --> 21:54.907
These are so cool! Look, honey,

21:54.941 --> 21:56.541
- coasters!
- Yes, they're really nice.

21:56.574 --> 21:58.044
Oh, my God!

21:58.077 --> 21:59.679
Great!

21:59.712 --> 22:01.981
Wow, coasters are great.

22:02.014 --> 22:03.916
Thank you.

22:03.950 --> 22:05.952
Hi, Uncle Frank.

22:05.985 --> 22:07.253
You're late.

22:07.286 --> 22:08.520
What's that?

22:08.553 --> 22:09.889
This is from Darla and Ben.

22:09.922 --> 22:11.090
Okay.

22:11.123 --> 22:13.159
Darla and Ben

22:13.192 --> 22:14.760
who are not here,

22:14.794 --> 22:16.494
so, we're not opening it.

22:16.528 --> 22:17.930
I know, it's because Darla
is in the hospital.

22:17.964 --> 22:19.732
Okay, honey,
we talked about this.

22:19.765 --> 22:21.667
Only happy thoughts
on my happy day.

22:21.701 --> 22:23.636
All right?

22:23.669 --> 22:24.870
I think you need some water,
honey.

22:24.904 --> 22:26.672
You're acting very weird.

22:26.706 --> 22:28.741
Uh-huh, okay, what's next?

22:28.774 --> 22:30.608
Oh, look at this basket.

22:31.576 --> 22:34.113
This basket, oh, my God, look,
it's got cookies,

22:34.146 --> 22:35.147
it's got...

22:35.181 --> 22:36.481
Not sharing.

22:37.183 --> 22:39.251
Are you getting
on the bandwagon too?

22:39.285 --> 22:41.586
He wants me to start baking.

22:44.890 --> 22:45.992
It has a "B."

22:46.025 --> 22:47.559
- For Betsy.
- For Betsy.

22:47.592 --> 22:49.729
Oh, my God, my very own mug.

22:49.762 --> 22:51.163
Woo, what's this?

22:51.197 --> 22:53.899
Oh, look,
there's spices in here too!

22:53.933 --> 22:55.768
What do we have?

22:55.801 --> 22:57.003
Oh, my... I...

22:58.337 --> 23:00.139
All right,
wipe that shit-eating grin

23:00.172 --> 23:02.241
off your face, Frankie.

23:02.274 --> 23:03.976
What?

23:04.010 --> 23:05.911
You're next.

23:05.945 --> 23:09.181
One of your girls will put you
through this soon enough.

23:09.215 --> 23:10.883
I got some time.

23:10.916 --> 23:12.651
No, you don't.

23:12.685 --> 23:13.986
None of us do.

23:14.954 --> 23:16.288
Okay.

23:16.322 --> 23:19.959
My first thought
when I wake every morning,

23:19.992 --> 23:22.828
I'm closer to death
than I was yesterday.

23:22.862 --> 23:23.963
Jesus, man.

23:23.996 --> 23:25.931
Six K!

23:25.965 --> 23:28.167
At this fucking party! Six K!

23:28.200 --> 23:32.671
Those fucking lanterns, shit,
like 500 bucks.

23:32.705 --> 23:36.075
They're going to get thrown in
the garbage in about two hours.

23:36.108 --> 23:37.309
Well, they look nice.

23:37.343 --> 23:39.544
Well,
I hope to fuck they do.

23:40.379 --> 23:41.747
You need another drink.

23:42.748 --> 23:44.283
I need a tranquilizer.

23:45.284 --> 23:47.987
You know how much this wedding
is going to run me?

23:48.020 --> 23:49.255
Nope.

23:51.891 --> 23:52.825
Uh...

23:54.193 --> 23:55.161
20K.

23:55.194 --> 23:56.695
Double that.

23:56.729 --> 23:57.663
If I'm lucky.

23:58.964 --> 24:00.900
Pray that yours elope.

24:00.933 --> 24:02.600
Frank, pray that they run off

24:02.635 --> 24:04.303
in the middle
of the fucking night and elope.

24:04.336 --> 24:07.006
Just set down some boundaries,
man, all right?

24:07.039 --> 24:08.841
Just sit Betsy down...

24:08.874 --> 24:11.077
Oh, my God, yay!

24:11.110 --> 24:13.045
This is my favorite
part of my party.

24:14.814 --> 24:17.183
And in record time,
Kathy's crying.

24:18.317 --> 24:20.186
Well, your sister's
a very sensitive woman.

24:20.219 --> 24:22.688
You know why people
cry at weddings?

24:22.721 --> 24:25.324
They are mourning
the love they once had.

24:25.357 --> 24:27.793
The love
they'll never have again.

24:27.827 --> 24:29.962
You're fucking bleak today, huh?

24:29.995 --> 24:30.796
Tell me I'm wrong.

24:32.965 --> 24:35.401
Hey, Uncle Jim.
It's a great party.

24:35.434 --> 24:37.203
- Never get married.
- Oh,

24:37.236 --> 24:38.938
yeah, no problem there,
kemosabe.

24:38.971 --> 24:40.673
Smart girl.

24:40.706 --> 24:42.041
Yo, yo, yo, Daddy-o,

24:42.074 --> 24:43.843
can you lend me some dough?

24:44.743 --> 24:46.212
Why?

24:46.245 --> 24:47.847
Because I need it.

24:48.781 --> 24:50.950
- No.
- I'm going to be getting

24:50.983 --> 24:53.152
some stuff for us.

24:53.185 --> 24:54.720
Wink, wink, wink, wink.

24:54.753 --> 24:55.788
- Wink, you know?
- Okay.

24:55.821 --> 24:56.989
Okay, mm-hmm.

24:57.022 --> 24:58.924
Took you a little while.

24:58.958 --> 24:59.859
Mm-hmm.

25:00.893 --> 25:02.761
What is happening?

25:02.795 --> 25:05.197
Uh, you two assholes
want to smoke some weed?

25:05.231 --> 25:06.799
Bartender's going
to sell me some.

25:06.832 --> 25:09.335
I am paying
that prick to serve drinks.

25:09.368 --> 25:11.237
Uncle Jim,
if there's anyone here

25:11.270 --> 25:13.139
who needs to smoke weed
right now,

25:13.172 --> 25:14.773
it's you.

25:14.807 --> 25:16.041
I don't do that.

25:18.144 --> 25:20.012
What,
I haven't smoked grass in years.

25:36.829 --> 25:38.030
You okay there, man?

25:39.031 --> 25:40.966
Great, the greatest.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.768
So you smoke
with your dad a lot?

25:42.801 --> 25:43.869
Oh, yeah.

25:43.903 --> 25:44.937
Yeah, he's my best friend.

25:45.871 --> 25:47.106
- Your best friend?
- Yeah,

25:47.139 --> 25:48.474
she found my stash when she was,

25:48.507 --> 25:50.176
what, seventeen?

25:50.209 --> 25:52.077
Eighteen, thank you.

25:52.111 --> 25:54.847
I had no clue
why my supply was dwindling

25:54.880 --> 25:57.983
and then I caught her up
on the roof with a doobie.

25:58.017 --> 26:00.352
He still says "doobie."

26:00.386 --> 26:01.887
Isn't that so cute?

26:01.921 --> 26:03.022
- "Doobie," I like it.
- Oh.

26:03.055 --> 26:04.857
That's what we called it then.

26:04.890 --> 26:07.126
- Hey, Jim, back me up, huh?
- Yeah.

26:07.159 --> 26:08.928
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

26:11.230 --> 26:12.932
Hey,
what're you doing after this?

26:12.965 --> 26:15.868
I'm supposed to meet up
with my girl, Darla. Why?

26:15.901 --> 26:17.203
I'm going to text you
this spot in Bushwick.

26:17.236 --> 26:19.805
Loft party, cool-ass people.

26:19.838 --> 26:21.407
- You should be there.
- Okay.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.043
You ask her out
right in front of me.

26:24.076 --> 26:26.745
You should come too,

26:26.779 --> 26:27.513
sir.

26:27.546 --> 26:29.748
Frank at a loft party.

26:31.050 --> 26:32.451
Hey, why is that so funny?

26:32.484 --> 26:34.887
Hey, Kathy and I used to party.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.355
Mom? Really?

26:36.388 --> 26:38.157
In the fucking '80s, maybe.

26:38.190 --> 26:40.392
I was the man.

26:40.426 --> 26:41.360
Legendary.

26:43.095 --> 26:44.396
Carl!

26:44.430 --> 26:45.998
You poor son-of-a-bitch!

26:46.031 --> 26:47.233
Do you want to smoke some weed?

26:47.266 --> 26:48.334
You guys are high?

26:48.367 --> 26:50.002
- Yeah.
- You want, man?

26:50.035 --> 26:51.070
No, I don't want.

26:51.103 --> 26:53.305
Jim, Betsy needs you inside.

26:53.339 --> 26:55.140
She just wants this.

26:55.174 --> 26:58.010
- Tell her to use the Amex.
- No, she wants to see you.

26:58.043 --> 26:59.979
She has to make
a special announcement.

27:00.012 --> 27:01.347
So tell her to make it.

27:01.380 --> 27:02.448
You have to be there!

27:03.849 --> 27:04.850
I don't know.

27:06.485 --> 27:09.488
Guess I should probably
go make some mimosas.

27:12.024 --> 27:13.392
Will I see you later?

27:13.425 --> 27:14.793
Yeah, maybe.

27:23.135 --> 27:26.105
Aren't you supposed to go inside
and hear her announcement?

27:26.138 --> 27:27.506
Oh, no, I already know.

27:29.842 --> 27:31.277
Oh, Jesus.

27:31.310 --> 27:33.812
Oh, I didn't think
it would happen so soon.

27:33.846 --> 27:35.514
Oh, wow.

27:35.547 --> 27:36.949
- What?
- You loaded

27:36.982 --> 27:38.284
that shotgun, huh?

27:38.317 --> 27:39.551
Oh.

27:39.585 --> 27:41.353
Oh, my God!

27:41.387 --> 27:43.055
She's knocked up?

27:43.088 --> 27:44.923
Oh!

27:44.957 --> 27:46.158
Oh, my God.

27:49.061 --> 27:50.396
I can't be a dad!

27:50.429 --> 27:52.231
Uh, what's the big deal?

27:52.264 --> 27:53.832
You're marrying her already.

27:53.866 --> 27:55.367
I don't know, it's, it's like,

27:55.401 --> 27:57.936
- it's all happening...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:57.970 --> 27:59.838
Yeah,
you'll probably be fine, okay?

27:59.872 --> 28:01.507
Yeah, we didn't want
Katy and we survived it.

28:01.540 --> 28:02.875
What?

28:02.908 --> 28:04.610
Oh, yeah,
you were a huge mistake.

28:04.644 --> 28:05.577
So was your sister.

28:05.611 --> 28:07.146
I was a mistake?

28:07.179 --> 28:08.447
Yeah. Well, like,

28:08.480 --> 28:11.150
you know,
we didn't want to have children.

28:11.183 --> 28:13.118
Your mom wanted
to stay at the agency

28:13.152 --> 28:16.121
and then, you know, boom, boom,
two girls.

28:16.155 --> 28:17.523
I don't think
I can go back in there.

28:19.659 --> 28:22.094
I think I am making
a huge mistake.

28:25.197 --> 28:26.999
Then don't do it.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.637
- What?
- Don't marry her.

28:30.670 --> 28:32.438
Save you both some time, kid.

28:32.471 --> 28:34.373
I couldn't do that.

28:34.406 --> 28:36.241
The, the wedding's
in a few weeks. She,

28:36.275 --> 28:38.544
she already planned so much,
she planned, she planned like...

28:39.646 --> 28:40.546
Everything.

28:40.579 --> 28:41.914
So what?

28:41.947 --> 28:43.315
- Dad.
- No, no,

28:43.349 --> 28:45.117
seriously.

28:45.150 --> 28:48.120
If you know in the pit of
your stomach that it's wrong,

28:49.021 --> 28:50.456
then...

28:50.489 --> 28:52.157
run.

28:52.191 --> 28:53.926
Do not walk.

29:03.670 --> 29:05.070
Faster than I thought he was.

29:05.104 --> 29:06.472
- Holy shit!
- I didn't,

29:06.505 --> 29:09.241
I didn't mean
to literally make him run.

29:09.274 --> 29:12.578
Yeah. I mean, Carl's not
much for metaphors, Dad.

29:12.611 --> 29:14.313
Yeah. Uh, you know,

29:14.346 --> 29:15.481
we should get out of here.

29:15.514 --> 29:17.249
Uh, somebody should tell Betsy.

29:17.282 --> 29:19.485
Oh, no, not me, not fucking way.

29:19.518 --> 29:22.254
Okay, so neither one of us
is going to go back inside,

29:22.287 --> 29:23.589
- correct?
- Correct.

29:23.622 --> 29:25.557
Cool.
I'm going to go meet Darla.

29:25.591 --> 29:27.459
Oh. Can I come?

29:27.493 --> 29:29.094
- No.
- Please?

29:29.128 --> 29:31.664
Come on, don't make me beg.

29:31.698 --> 29:33.198
Make my knees hurt too much.

29:33.232 --> 29:34.166
Oh, my God.

29:35.134 --> 29:37.069
Ow! God.

29:37.102 --> 29:38.036
No.

29:38.070 --> 29:40.372
Hoo-woo!

29:41.340 --> 29:42.574
Yo, boo,

29:42.608 --> 29:45.645
your dad is fucked right now.

29:45.678 --> 29:48.080
I told him not to take it.

29:48.113 --> 29:49.415
She took it.

29:49.448 --> 29:53.051
Yeah, pops,
I'm used to this shit.

29:56.188 --> 29:57.990
Merry Christmas, daddy-o.

29:58.023 --> 30:01.160
You about to get real warm.

30:03.595 --> 30:05.497
Where are we?

30:05.531 --> 30:08.200
Brooklyn.

30:10.703 --> 30:15.240
I spent my whole childhood
getting out of Brooklyn.

30:15.274 --> 30:17.075
And you dragged me back.

30:17.109 --> 30:18.645
You asked to come.

30:20.012 --> 30:21.413
Brooklyn!

30:21.447 --> 30:22.514
I love you!

30:22.548 --> 30:24.483
Oh, wow.

30:24.516 --> 30:27.453
Dad, hey, okay. Hey, Dad?

30:27.486 --> 30:29.756
I need you to get your shit
together right now.

30:29.789 --> 30:32.391
Hey, hey, hey.

30:33.325 --> 30:35.662
Don't make me regret
sharing my drugs.

30:39.632 --> 30:42.201
Okay, old man, let's go party.

30:47.707 --> 30:49.642
You smell like cinnamon.

30:49.676 --> 30:53.312
No, I smell
like all the spices, baby.

30:53.345 --> 30:54.413
That's right.

30:54.446 --> 30:55.481
Let's go.

30:55.514 --> 30:56.749
- Come on.
- Okay.

31:00.586 --> 31:01.654
What's up, baby?

31:02.755 --> 31:05.023
- It's been awhile, huh?
- Okay, let's go.

31:05.057 --> 31:07.125
Here we go, inside, okay.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.755
Fucking showoff.

31:41.293 --> 31:42.594
Oh, Darla, I know this song!

31:42.629 --> 31:44.062
I know this song!

31:45.197 --> 31:46.031
Yeah!

31:47.232 --> 31:49.535
Get it,
Mr. Benetto, get it!

32:04.149 --> 32:05.284
Not tonight. Not tonight,

32:05.317 --> 32:06.518
big papa, not tonight.

32:06.552 --> 32:07.720
What night?

32:07.754 --> 32:09.087
Tell me, what night?

32:11.623 --> 32:13.225
Your dad's a perv.

32:13.258 --> 32:14.593
I know.

32:14.626 --> 32:16.228
Hey, Dad, fuck off!

32:18.765 --> 32:19.666
Hey.

32:20.566 --> 32:23.268
Hey! Oh.

32:23.302 --> 32:26.171
And your dad is actually here.

32:26.204 --> 32:27.874
Bartender!

32:27.907 --> 32:29.508
Hi, hi!

32:29.541 --> 32:30.810
You are such a great bartender.

32:30.843 --> 32:32.879
I love you!

32:32.912 --> 32:35.648
- What's with him?
- I gave him molly.

32:35.682 --> 32:38.517
It is going to be a night,
my friend.

32:38.550 --> 32:41.186
I love you guys.

32:41.219 --> 32:43.155
I love life.

32:43.188 --> 32:46.291
Oh, I love those sparkly lights.

32:46.325 --> 32:48.460
Love you too, <i>padre!</i>

32:48.493 --> 32:50.362
Look, he might actually
get naked, girl.

32:50.395 --> 32:52.230
Like high possibility of nudity.

32:52.264 --> 32:54.634
Please, don't say that.

32:54.667 --> 32:57.469
Wouldn't be out
of the norm for these parties.

32:57.502 --> 32:58.738
Who I this young lady?

32:58.771 --> 33:01.506
This is my girl.

33:01.540 --> 33:02.709
That's right.

33:02.742 --> 33:03.776
You're cute.

33:04.877 --> 33:06.612
I'm gorgeous, motherfucker.

33:06.646 --> 33:08.347
Yeah, you are.

33:14.486 --> 33:16.221
You guys see the roof yet?

33:16.254 --> 33:18.825
Got a tree up there,
all decked out, amazing view.

33:19.826 --> 33:21.193
I'll fix you a drink.

33:21.928 --> 33:23.395
- Okay.
- I don't...

33:23.428 --> 33:25.197
I don't know
if I should leave him.

33:25.898 --> 33:27.734
Look at that asshole.

33:27.767 --> 33:30.535
He is living
his best life right now.

33:31.771 --> 33:32.872
To the roof, sir.

34:45.277 --> 34:46.411
You better now?

34:48.047 --> 34:49.849
Uh-huh.

34:51.450 --> 34:52.417
Oh.

34:54.553 --> 34:55.655
Wait.

34:55.688 --> 34:57.222
Who are you supposed to be?

34:58.457 --> 35:00.960
Are you Santa's little helper?

35:00.993 --> 35:03.996
Sure, let's go with that.

35:04.030 --> 35:07.734
Um, how in the sweet hell
did you end up in here?

35:07.767 --> 35:09.669
Mm, fate.

35:09.702 --> 35:11.603
All right.

35:11.637 --> 35:14.439
A fatalist. Yes.

35:16.508 --> 35:18.878
You're a beautiful person,
you know that?

35:18.911 --> 35:20.612
I mean, I'm a very
good judge of this, and,

35:20.646 --> 35:22.982
and you glow, you're,
you're glowing.

35:23.015 --> 35:26.652
Shit, you trying to play
daddy tonight, Daddy?

35:26.686 --> 35:28.420
What, oh. Uh, no,

35:28.453 --> 35:30.422
I'm just making conversation.

35:31.490 --> 35:34.727
You got some moves.

35:35.661 --> 35:37.562
So, what do you do?

35:37.596 --> 35:38.765
I'm a mystic, baby.

35:40.900 --> 35:42.835
I don't know what that means.

35:42.869 --> 35:44.804
Exactly.

35:44.837 --> 35:47.640
Can I, uh, read your cards?

35:49.108 --> 35:50.609
Shuffle.

35:50.643 --> 35:52.377
Think about a question you have,

35:52.410 --> 35:54.680
cut the deck into three piles
with your left hand.

35:56.115 --> 35:57.683
Why my left hand?

35:57.717 --> 35:59.051
Because I said.

36:07.894 --> 36:09.629
Choose a pile.

36:09.662 --> 36:10.663
Okay.

36:10.696 --> 36:13.065
Choose it with your heart.

36:15.034 --> 36:16.769
I don't know
what my heart wants.

36:16.803 --> 36:18.436
Well, that's interesting.

36:21.808 --> 36:22.775
Bingo.

36:34.954 --> 36:38.623
Your past, your present,
your future.

36:40.625 --> 36:41.994
Hmm.

36:42.028 --> 36:43.461
What?

36:43.495 --> 36:45.363
Oh.

36:45.397 --> 36:49.568
Did you lose someone, like,
like recently?

36:49.601 --> 36:51.369
No.

36:51.403 --> 36:52.504
Hmm.

36:52.537 --> 36:54.140
Well, maybe it's you.

36:54.173 --> 36:55.808
You're lost.

36:55.842 --> 36:56.909
You feeling lost?

36:58.044 --> 36:59.411
Yeah, sure.

36:59.444 --> 37:00.746
This one.

37:00.780 --> 37:01.848
It's reversed.

37:01.881 --> 37:04.083
So you're living in your head.

37:04.116 --> 37:07.419
And you're living
with all of this anxiety.

37:07.452 --> 37:08.654
You're stuck

37:08.688 --> 37:10.122
or you think you're stuck.

37:10.156 --> 37:12.692
You need to move past
whatever is up here.

37:12.725 --> 37:15.628
- What's that one?
- Oh, it doesn't mean what you think it means.

37:15.661 --> 37:17.630
It usually means change.

37:17.663 --> 37:18.865
What kind of change?

37:19.966 --> 37:22.467
I mean, big change.

37:23.703 --> 37:24.804
Oh.

37:24.837 --> 37:26.739
I don't like that card.

37:26.772 --> 37:29.008
The imagery is dramatic,
the meaning isn't.

37:29.041 --> 37:30.508
- Okay.
- It's like,

37:30.542 --> 37:32.544
you have like a core comfort
or belief

37:32.577 --> 37:35.580
and you have to burn it
to the fucking ground.

37:35.614 --> 37:38.117
Sounds pretty dramatic.

37:38.150 --> 37:39.752
Hmm.

37:39.785 --> 37:41.754
Change is good, right?

37:41.787 --> 37:43.689
It's always been good to me.

37:43.723 --> 37:44.790
But look at this.

37:44.824 --> 37:47.026
So calm, so peaceful.

37:47.059 --> 37:49.996
These are lovely cards.

37:50.029 --> 37:51.030
They are?

37:51.931 --> 37:53.565
Yeah.

37:53.598 --> 37:57.535
You just need to push
through this bullshit.

37:57.569 --> 37:59.038
- Push.
- Yeah, push.

38:00.472 --> 38:01.573
It'll be fine.

38:03.075 --> 38:04.143
I promise.

38:06.812 --> 38:08.513
You feel like him.

38:10.482 --> 38:12.517
Oh, no,
you're beautiful like him.

38:13.986 --> 38:15.021
Like who?

38:16.022 --> 38:17.790
I'm sorry, I'm...

38:19.859 --> 38:22.094
- Mm.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:25.998 --> 38:27.667
Let go of this, yes?

38:29.101 --> 38:30.836
And whatever you're
torturing yourself about,

38:30.870 --> 38:32.570
my little King of Knives,

38:34.506 --> 38:35.908
it's not worth it.

38:45.217 --> 38:46.518
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

38:48.654 --> 38:49.689
I'm so sorry.

38:49.722 --> 38:51.190
Daddy,

38:51.223 --> 38:53.125
honey, come back.

38:53.159 --> 38:54.093
Uh.

38:57.163 --> 38:59.265
I'm so sorry.

38:59.298 --> 39:00.700
Sorry for what?

39:03.769 --> 39:05.671
For how I was with him.

39:05.705 --> 39:07.873
You can't change the past,
you know?

39:10.209 --> 39:11.777
I know that.

39:15.147 --> 39:16.916
I never talk about it.

39:16.949 --> 39:18.017
Dad?

39:18.050 --> 39:20.653
Jesus, I thought I'd lost you!

39:21.619 --> 39:22.855
W... Are you okay?

39:22.888 --> 39:24.522
What's going on?

39:24.556 --> 39:26.192
He's just gotten
a little emotional.

39:27.159 --> 39:28.794
Katy, did I fail him?

39:29.695 --> 39:31.864
I think we unlocked something.

39:31.897 --> 39:34.599
Well,
that was a fucking mistake.

39:34.633 --> 39:37.770
No, I did, I screwed up.

39:37.803 --> 39:39.238
Okay, yeah,
we're not doing this here.

39:39.271 --> 39:40.873
I am so sorry.

39:40.906 --> 39:43.709
Don't be,
I think it's beautiful.

39:43.743 --> 39:45.077
Okay, get up!

39:45.111 --> 39:46.879
- Oh, okay.
- Jesus Christ.

39:47.980 --> 39:50.049
Wait.

39:50.082 --> 39:51.684
You...

39:51.717 --> 39:53.019
are really special.

39:56.621 --> 39:57.923
- Okay.
- Bye, Frank.

39:59.325 --> 40:00.893
Come on!

40:14.006 --> 40:15.975
What happened to the bartender?

40:16.008 --> 40:17.843
Ah, he was an asshole.

40:17.877 --> 40:20.012
I liked him.

40:20.046 --> 40:21.847
Oh, pretty lights.

40:21.881 --> 40:24.183
Nah, he wasn't so nice,
he was not a gentleman.

40:25.117 --> 40:27.153
Well, he was a man, so...

40:27.186 --> 40:29.021
We don't have to talk about him.

40:29.055 --> 40:30.990
What'd he do?

40:31.023 --> 40:34.860
He wanted me and your daughter
to do nasty shit together.

40:34.894 --> 40:37.029
- Like what?
- Dad!

40:37.063 --> 40:39.597
What, you want me to go beat
the shit out of him for you?

40:39.632 --> 40:42.101
I don't think that's
going to do much good, Dad.

40:42.134 --> 40:44.003
I appreciate the sentiment,
pops.

40:44.036 --> 40:45.905
Okay.

40:45.938 --> 40:48.274
So what was going on between
you and that guy in the tent?

40:48.307 --> 40:50.843
Oh, Sebastian.

40:50.876 --> 40:52.745
Sure, Sebastian the glitter elf.

40:52.778 --> 40:55.347
Yeah. I might...

40:55.381 --> 40:57.349
He was really...

40:57.383 --> 41:01.187
...I'm feeling all
of these things right now.

41:01.220 --> 41:03.122
That's the drugs, sir.

41:03.155 --> 41:06.624
Yeah, it's like,
I can see my whole life.

41:06.659 --> 41:10.396
Like these little snippets,
you know?

41:10.429 --> 41:13.966
And all the bad things
that I did to your mom

41:13.999 --> 41:18.304
and to you kids,
they're like little lazer beams.

41:18.337 --> 41:20.106
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

41:20.139 --> 41:23.375
Yeah, but you and mom got
past that shit though, so.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.249
I had extramarital affairs.

41:31.450 --> 41:32.985
- A lot of them.
- I don't

41:33.018 --> 41:34.286
particularly want
to talk about our dirty

41:34.320 --> 41:35.955
laundry with my friend,
thank you.

41:35.988 --> 41:37.923
Uh, road!

41:39.692 --> 41:41.393
I was good for a while,

41:42.461 --> 41:44.730
years, good to her.

41:45.431 --> 41:47.399
- And then...
- Dad!

41:47.433 --> 41:48.734
Then what?

41:48.767 --> 41:49.835
Darla!

41:50.803 --> 41:56.242
You can only deny
your true self for so long

41:56.275 --> 41:59.411
and I was a monster to Dan.

41:59.445 --> 42:01.380
I just couldn't...

42:01.413 --> 42:03.249
Look,

42:03.282 --> 42:06.152
I am not a homophobe.

42:07.219 --> 42:08.420
Just...

42:08.454 --> 42:11.023
Not my only son, you know?

42:11.056 --> 42:13.692
That sounds
pretty homophobic to me.

42:13.726 --> 42:15.861
I don't want to talk
about Danny right now, okay?

42:15.895 --> 42:17.263
I can't handle it.

42:18.731 --> 42:20.299
Hun,

42:20.332 --> 42:21.333
it's okay.

42:21.367 --> 42:22.334
It's not though.

42:23.435 --> 42:26.005
Wait, are you guys gay?

42:26.038 --> 42:27.406
What?

42:27.439 --> 42:29.742
Like, are you two like together?

42:29.775 --> 42:31.877
No, no, Jesus. No.

42:31.911 --> 42:34.113
Oh, it's, it's fine if you are.

42:34.146 --> 42:35.781
Oh, really?

42:35.814 --> 42:37.283
Sure.

42:37.316 --> 42:39.251
When did you change
your mind about that then?

42:40.186 --> 42:42.454
Uh, I don't know. I, I,

42:42.488 --> 42:44.990
I'm just saying that you should,
uh,

42:45.024 --> 42:47.893
you should follow your hearts,
that's all.

42:47.927 --> 42:49.762
Are you trying
to father me right now?

42:50.863 --> 42:52.064
Yeah.

42:53.532 --> 42:56.368
It's a little late for that,
don't you think?

42:56.402 --> 42:57.503
Oh.

42:57.536 --> 42:59.004
- What are you doing?
- Oh, oh.

42:59.038 --> 43:00.839
Road!

43:00.873 --> 43:02.174
Oh, sorry.

43:02.208 --> 43:04.410
- Not in the back seat!
- Road!

43:07.179 --> 43:09.348
No, please. No, no, no, no,
no, no.

43:09.381 --> 43:11.217
No, no, no, no.

43:11.250 --> 43:13.252
Shit.

43:13.285 --> 43:15.287
No, I really, like,
I can smell it right now.

43:15.321 --> 43:17.256
- Just open the windows, open the windows.
- I can smell it.

43:17.289 --> 43:19.291
Fuck!

43:19.325 --> 43:21.160
- Kathy!
- Stop yelling.

43:21.193 --> 43:22.861
- Oh, whoa.
- Oh, my God.

43:22.895 --> 43:24.396
Kathy.

43:25.965 --> 43:27.266
- Oh!
- Oh, God, no.

43:27.299 --> 43:29.868
Oh, wow, come on. On three.

43:29.902 --> 43:32.404
- One, two, three.
- Whoa!

43:32.438 --> 43:34.540
Come on, help us, Dad.

43:34.573 --> 43:35.808
Jesus.

43:37.343 --> 43:38.544
Yeah!

43:38.577 --> 43:40.746
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:42.114 --> 43:43.415
No! No!

43:43.449 --> 43:44.984
No, Dad.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.789
- Come on, come on.
- Dad.

43:50.823 --> 43:52.524
Dad, get up!

43:52.558 --> 43:54.059
Uh-oh.

43:54.093 --> 43:55.828
Oh, come on. Nice, Kaitlin.

43:55.861 --> 43:57.296
Just get him inside.

43:57.329 --> 43:58.964
Are you okay?
Can you stand?

43:58.998 --> 44:01.033
- I'll help.
- I'm fine.

44:02.268 --> 44:04.136
She should help. She's
the one that did this to him.

44:04.169 --> 44:05.371
I didn't do shit.

44:05.404 --> 44:06.972
You encouraged him.

44:07.006 --> 44:08.440
He's not a fucking child.

44:08.474 --> 44:10.409
Yes, he is!

44:10.442 --> 44:11.510
Oh.

44:11.543 --> 44:13.545
Oh, God, just get the Febreze.

44:13.579 --> 44:15.014
Why?

44:15.047 --> 44:16.849
Because my car smalls like...

44:16.882 --> 44:18.284
I threw up!

44:18.317 --> 44:20.853
I can get him in.

44:20.886 --> 44:22.454
Okay, come on, over here.

44:22.488 --> 44:24.823
Beautiful. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right here.

44:25.958 --> 44:28.193
- Oh!
- Jesus.

44:28.227 --> 44:29.161
Okay.

44:30.429 --> 44:32.398
Whoa!

44:38.638 --> 44:39.538
You happy?

44:39.571 --> 44:41.006
Oh, delighted.

44:41.040 --> 44:42.541
Yeah, cleaning up Dad's puke.

44:42.574 --> 44:43.542
Banner Saturday night.

44:43.575 --> 44:45.144
Well, Mom's pissed.

44:45.177 --> 44:47.313
God, what else is new?

44:47.346 --> 44:50.883
You two left us in the middle
of a shit storm. Poor Betsy...

44:50.916 --> 44:52.985
You know who I give zero
shits about right now,

44:53.018 --> 44:55.254
is Betsy. Fuck her.

44:55.287 --> 44:58.257
Carl ran off,
which you apparently knew,

44:58.290 --> 44:59.291
and poor Betsy...

44:59.325 --> 45:00.893
Is pregnant, yeah.

45:00.926 --> 45:02.594
Yeah, congratulations to her
by the way.

45:02.629 --> 45:04.196
This is the first
interesting thing

45:04.229 --> 45:05.564
that has ever happened to her.

45:05.597 --> 45:07.099
Kaitlin, she is inside,
lower your voice.

45:07.132 --> 45:09.435
I don't give a shit
if she hears me!

45:09.468 --> 45:10.936
You know it's true.

45:11.904 --> 45:14.006
God, when did you
become this thing?

45:14.039 --> 45:15.974
This Stepford Wife?

45:17.576 --> 45:19.445
A few years ago, you would've
been in the corner with me

45:19.478 --> 45:22.614
shitting on stupid Betsy
and her stupid shower.

45:22.649 --> 45:24.883
She is a garbage person.

45:28.053 --> 45:29.221
I'm not a Stepford Wife.

45:30.189 --> 45:31.490
No.

45:31.523 --> 45:33.192
You're worse.

45:33.225 --> 45:34.226
You want to be one.

45:35.461 --> 45:38.297
I can't imagine what will happen

45:38.330 --> 45:41.600
when Patrick grows
a pair and leaves you.

45:41.634 --> 45:44.136
- Patrick loves me.
- Woof!

45:44.169 --> 45:46.605
Jesus, this angry fucking
thing you've turned into!

45:46.639 --> 45:49.108
I have no idea
why you need to numb

45:49.141 --> 45:50.442
whatever's going on inside.

45:50.476 --> 45:51.977
Yes, you do!

45:52.010 --> 45:53.278
You do, okay?

45:53.312 --> 45:55.648
All of you are
just as fucked up as me!

45:55.682 --> 45:57.583
- At least I'm expressing myself.
- By drinking

45:57.616 --> 45:59.652
yourself stupid
and leaching off Mom and Dad.

45:59.686 --> 46:01.954
- Yes, expressing myself!
- I'm worried

46:01.987 --> 46:04.056
- about you.
- Oh, my God.

46:04.089 --> 46:05.991
When I get calls after midnight,
I feel like it's someone

46:06.024 --> 46:07.960
calling to tell me you're dead.

46:07.993 --> 46:10.462
You know what the craziest
part of that statement is?

46:10.496 --> 46:12.965
Someone calls you
after midnight.

46:14.634 --> 46:15.968
- You have...
- Hey.

46:19.538 --> 46:22.207
He's throwing up
in the kitchen sink.

46:22.241 --> 46:23.509
Just FYI.

46:25.377 --> 46:26.378
Great.

46:43.996 --> 46:45.698
Dad's real fucked up, huh?

46:45.732 --> 46:46.932
Yeah.

46:48.267 --> 46:49.168
Yep.

46:50.602 --> 46:52.070
Burbs, man.

46:55.574 --> 46:58.243
Y'all break down for real.

46:58.277 --> 47:01.113
He's just going through, like,
some weird shit.

47:01.146 --> 47:02.247
Yeah.

47:03.415 --> 47:05.484
You know who I don't
have sympathy for?

47:07.419 --> 47:09.521
Aging rich white dudes.

47:10.422 --> 47:11.323
Mm-mm.

47:15.728 --> 47:16.663
You okay?

47:17.630 --> 47:18.997
No.

47:22.334 --> 47:23.368
Aw.

47:23.402 --> 47:25.170
Baby.

47:33.612 --> 47:34.747
Let's just go home.

47:37.082 --> 47:40.552
I fucked that bartender
at my cousin's shower.

47:41.821 --> 47:45.023
Not because I wanted to,
but because I was bored.

47:48.627 --> 47:49.528
Okay.

47:51.396 --> 47:53.999
Like, I knew he would try
what he did tonight.

47:55.234 --> 47:56.736
Then why would you
bring me there then?

47:58.504 --> 48:00.239
I thought it,
I thought it would be fun.

48:01.440 --> 48:02.775
For who, for you?

48:04.142 --> 48:05.511
I told you, I don't share.

48:06.445 --> 48:07.613
So I belong to you now?

48:07.647 --> 48:10.082
Not what I said.

48:10.115 --> 48:11.550
Why you picking
a fight with me right now?

48:11.583 --> 48:13.418
- I'm not!
- Yeah, you are!

48:13.452 --> 48:15.087
No, I'm really...

48:20.392 --> 48:21.460
Just drive me home.

48:27.266 --> 48:28.300
Fuck.

48:48.453 --> 48:50.222
I just can't hang
like I used to.

48:53.625 --> 48:56.796
Oh, getting older sucks.

48:58.397 --> 48:59.666
Maybe because you're
not supposed to be

48:59.699 --> 49:02.167
partying at your age, huh?

49:03.201 --> 49:04.336
My age?

49:05.537 --> 49:10.677
I remember thinking that anyone
over 50 was like ancient.

49:12.578 --> 49:14.112
And here I am.

49:15.815 --> 49:17.549
You know,

49:17.583 --> 49:19.184
I never felt my age.

49:20.419 --> 49:22.755
I don't even know if that ever
really happens to a person.

49:24.389 --> 49:27.292
I can remember moments
from my childhood...

49:28.795 --> 49:30.295
that are so clear.

49:32.732 --> 49:36.501
I can close my eyes
and still smell the perfume

49:36.535 --> 49:38.470
your mom wore when I met her.

49:40.840 --> 49:43.843
And what it felt like
the first time I held you guys.

49:45.912 --> 49:48.815
It was clear and full.

49:49.849 --> 49:52.785
Now, I'm just sitting back

49:52.819 --> 49:56.355
and letting life
do what it does.

49:57.356 --> 50:03.261
Now I know that my body's
just rotting from the inside.

50:03.295 --> 50:04.363
Are you sick?

50:04.396 --> 50:06.733
No.

50:06.766 --> 50:08.133
I'm just...

50:10.435 --> 50:12.504
I know I'm on this track.

50:13.605 --> 50:16.776
And it's like
the rollercoaster's done

50:16.809 --> 50:19.611
giving me
all the dives and twists

50:19.646 --> 50:23.248
and so we're just pulling
into the station

50:23.281 --> 50:26.919
and I'm just reflecting
on how crazy it all was.

50:28.387 --> 50:32.759
And I'm not
ready for that yet, you know?

50:32.792 --> 50:35.928
I'm not particularly proud

50:35.962 --> 50:38.731
of the track I left in my wake.

50:39.866 --> 50:41.333
You're mixing metaphors.

50:42.869 --> 50:44.202
Yeah.

50:44.236 --> 50:45.638
You understand though.

50:48.407 --> 50:50.677
I'm going to go sleep this off,
you know.

50:51.878 --> 50:53.311
Is your mom awake?

50:53.345 --> 50:54.579
Yeah.

50:54.613 --> 50:58.316
She was exhausted
after the shower.

50:58.350 --> 50:59.819
Um, Dad,

51:00.753 --> 51:02.587
there's something
you should know.

51:10.863 --> 51:11.764
Uncle Frank?

51:13.498 --> 51:14.701
Betsy.

51:14.734 --> 51:16.636
How're you holding up?

51:16.669 --> 51:17.970
Do you hate me, Uncle Frank?

51:18.004 --> 51:20.439
No, of course not.

51:20.472 --> 51:22.709
He won't take my calls,
Uncle Frank.

51:22.742 --> 51:24.342
He's going to leave me

51:24.376 --> 51:27.847
because you told him
not to marry me.

51:29.782 --> 51:32.018
Why would you do that?

51:32.051 --> 51:35.287
I have always tried to be
the best niece to you.

51:35.320 --> 51:36.521
Haven't I been?

51:37.622 --> 51:41.027
I don't know why you would say
something like that.

51:41.060 --> 51:42.929
Why would you?

51:42.962 --> 51:44.262
Why!

51:44.296 --> 51:45.597
Because he was unhappy.

51:45.631 --> 51:47.700
Carl was my soulmate!

51:47.734 --> 51:50.302
Oh, okay, where do we start?

51:50.335 --> 51:51.938
Okay, soulmates?

51:51.971 --> 51:54.473
That whole concept
of like only one person

51:54.506 --> 51:55.742
being right for you
in the whole world.

51:55.775 --> 51:57.576
It's total horseshit.

51:57.609 --> 51:58.711
Dad.

51:58.745 --> 52:00.046
You will meet so many

52:00.079 --> 52:02.682
people that'll feel
like "the one."

52:03.750 --> 52:07.019
And if you'd bother to look
outside of a ten mile radius...

52:07.053 --> 52:09.321
Ten mile radius,
what does that mean?

52:09.354 --> 52:11.389
- Betsy.
- It is not my fault

52:11.423 --> 52:14.526
that you hate your stupid life.

52:14.559 --> 52:17.496
I will have you know
that Carl and I

52:17.529 --> 52:21.033
have been in love
since high school.

52:21.067 --> 52:24.637
Uh, please, voices down, okay?

52:25.638 --> 52:28.908
Marrying your high school
sweetheart is, uh,

52:28.941 --> 52:30.042
what's the word, um,

52:30.076 --> 52:30.977
dumb.

52:31.010 --> 52:32.745
You married young.

52:32.779 --> 52:35.848
Yeah, and I have been
an awful husband since then.

52:35.882 --> 52:37.616
No, you haven't.

52:37.650 --> 52:38.617
He hasn't.

52:38.651 --> 52:39.986
Yes, I have.

52:41.486 --> 52:44.422
You want to know how
many times I strayed?

52:44.456 --> 52:48.027
I was mean, distant,
you name it.

52:48.060 --> 52:51.030
I mean, I never deserved meeting
a woman like her, and...

52:52.597 --> 52:55.735
I married Kathy
because I was scared shitless.

52:56.803 --> 52:59.038
I married her because...

52:59.071 --> 53:01.974
...you know, I didn't know what else
to do with my life and she was kind,

53:03.709 --> 53:04.844
too kind.

53:05.878 --> 53:07.345
And, uh, I shouldn't have.

53:07.379 --> 53:08.881
Daddy,

53:08.915 --> 53:10.415
- stop!
- I wasn't

53:10.448 --> 53:11.818
ready to be a father either.

53:12.718 --> 53:15.021
I mean, I worked weekends,

53:16.022 --> 53:17.890
weeknights.

53:17.924 --> 53:20.726
You know, I was barely there
when you guys were growing up.

53:21.694 --> 53:23.963
And I put it all on Kathy.

53:23.996 --> 53:29.367
My whole life I've made
choices out of fear, Betsy.

53:29.401 --> 53:30.837
Now, I, uh,

53:30.870 --> 53:33.039
look in the mirror and I,
I go...

53:33.940 --> 53:35.641
"...Where did all
that fucking time go?"

53:36.943 --> 53:39.078
Well, that's your own fault!

53:39.111 --> 53:40.713
Yes, it is.

53:40.746 --> 53:42.447
Just because you're
all jaded doesn't mean

53:42.480 --> 53:45.751
you get to ruin
everyone else's happiness.

53:45.785 --> 53:47.485
Mm, you're not happy, honey.

53:47.519 --> 53:49.755
I am so happy!

53:49.789 --> 53:53.159
I'm pregnant and we're
going to have a family.

53:53.192 --> 53:55.527
And what
if he doesn't want a family?

53:55.560 --> 53:57.129
He does!

53:57.163 --> 53:59.098
I know he does.

53:59.131 --> 54:01.934
You need to call Carl
and tell him.

54:01.968 --> 54:04.704
You tell him
that he's making a mistake.

54:04.737 --> 54:06.839
I stand by what I told him.

54:06.873 --> 54:08.641
- What!
- I'm saving you

54:08.674 --> 54:11.110
both so much time

54:11.143 --> 54:13.145
and you can hate me
if you want to.

54:13.179 --> 54:14.546
- I do!
- Mm.

54:14.579 --> 54:16.015
I do hate you!

54:17.482 --> 54:18.483
And so do your kids!

54:18.516 --> 54:19.852
Everybody knows it.

54:21.787 --> 54:23.089
You know it's true.

54:24.090 --> 54:25.992
What you'll learn, Betsy,

54:27.059 --> 54:30.997
is that all relationships
have about as much hate

54:31.030 --> 54:32.497
as they do love.

54:33.598 --> 54:35.167
And without the former...

54:35.201 --> 54:37.870
you can't
appreciate the latter.

54:39.038 --> 54:40.673
And I know exactly what my kids

54:40.706 --> 54:42.875
think of me and I know
it's not all sunshine

54:42.909 --> 54:44.977
and junipers, and... okay?

54:47.647 --> 54:48.814
You need some water?

54:48.848 --> 54:50.016
No!

54:54.720 --> 54:56.088
Uncle Frank, please.

54:57.023 --> 54:58.958
Will you call Carl, please?

55:00.760 --> 55:03.029
I don't know what I'm going
to do without him.

55:05.965 --> 55:08.533
You're going to be just fine.

55:08.566 --> 55:11.003
Go home, sleep,

55:11.037 --> 55:12.872
call him in the morning.

55:12.905 --> 55:13.906
Okay?

55:18.110 --> 55:21.647
You fucker, you ruined my life!

55:21.681 --> 55:24.817
Your Dad is an asshole.

55:24.850 --> 55:26.018
I know, he is, I know.

55:26.052 --> 55:28.620
I hate him!

55:35.627 --> 55:36.862
You all right?

55:38.064 --> 55:39.198
Not really.

55:46.205 --> 55:49.008
Oh, Jesus,
you smell like a hobo.

55:49.041 --> 55:50.176
Yeah, I know.

55:52.678 --> 55:53.879
Did you hear all that?

55:57.783 --> 55:58.951
Oh.

56:01.087 --> 56:02.088
I'm sorry.

56:04.991 --> 56:05.992
I feel strange.

56:08.227 --> 56:10.096
Hearing you say it all out loud.

56:14.333 --> 56:15.768
- Sorry.
- You know,

56:15.801 --> 56:17.103
it's kind of, um...

56:19.939 --> 56:21.573
Sobering.

56:21.606 --> 56:22.574
You know?

56:24.010 --> 56:26.578
She has been here all night.

56:26.611 --> 56:28.881
She's used up
every Kleenex in the house.

56:32.584 --> 56:33.618
I'm sorry.

56:34.920 --> 56:36.255
You should be.

56:36.288 --> 56:38.224
For all of it.

56:38.257 --> 56:39.191
You should be.

56:47.700 --> 56:49.735
I'm sleeping
in Danny's room again.

57:00.246 --> 57:01.213
Coffee?

57:02.214 --> 57:03.249
Sure.

57:03.282 --> 57:05.284
Hot or iced?

57:05.317 --> 57:08.054
I still can't get over
how warm it is.

57:08.087 --> 57:09.155
Iced, yeah.

57:10.622 --> 57:13.159
Thank you global warning.

57:13.192 --> 57:14.226
Is Mom up?

57:14.260 --> 57:16.228
She's getting that massage.

57:16.262 --> 57:18.330
Oh, great, great.

57:18.364 --> 57:19.965
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:22.301 --> 57:24.103
You need anything?

57:24.136 --> 57:25.905
No.

57:25.938 --> 57:26.972
Okay.

57:30.109 --> 57:31.010
Um.

57:32.044 --> 57:35.613
Did Patrick ask you
something the other night?

57:35.648 --> 57:36.715
Yup.

57:38.284 --> 57:39.584
And?

57:42.188 --> 57:43.222
I told him, "Sure."

57:45.324 --> 57:46.292
Oh.

57:47.293 --> 57:49.295
Oh? Isn't that what you wanted?

57:51.297 --> 57:52.765
Yeah?

57:53.766 --> 57:54.733
Okay.

57:56.268 --> 57:57.602
Okay, bye.

58:03.742 --> 58:04.710
Oh, wow.

58:11.817 --> 58:13.252
- Yeah?
- <i>Frank,</i>

58:13.285 --> 58:15.754
<i>we are in crisis mode here.</i>

58:15.788 --> 58:17.156
Why?

58:17.189 --> 58:18.657
<i>They didn't buy it.</i>

58:20.126 --> 58:21.660
What part?

58:21.694 --> 58:23.028
<i>Any of it.
They hate the new Sammy,</i>

58:23.062 --> 58:24.363
<i>they think
it's offensively urban.</i>

58:24.396 --> 58:25.898
<i>Those fuckers...</i>

58:29.869 --> 58:30.870
Morning, Kathy.

58:31.770 --> 58:32.838
I haven't seen you in a while.

58:32.872 --> 58:34.206
I know.

58:34.240 --> 58:35.808
Tension in the usual spots.

58:36.775 --> 58:39.078
Just let me know
how the pressure is.

58:39.111 --> 58:40.412
Don't be afraid to pipe up.

58:42.815 --> 58:43.883
Breathe with me, okay?

58:52.725 --> 58:54.026
I'm going to go a little deeper.

58:56.295 --> 58:57.763
You really are tense today.

59:01.167 --> 59:02.701
Is that too hard?

59:02.735 --> 59:03.435
No.

59:12.444 --> 59:13.812
Missed you, Kath.

59:15.481 --> 59:16.715
I know.

59:25.391 --> 59:26.992
Oh, my...

59:29.028 --> 59:30.095
God!

59:35.201 --> 59:37.469
Baby, that's, uh...

59:39.138 --> 59:40.739
That...

59:40.773 --> 59:41.840
was...

59:43.108 --> 59:44.376
so...

59:44.410 --> 59:46.078
sexy.

59:47.846 --> 59:49.949
Uh...

59:49.982 --> 59:53.285
What, um, what was the occasion?

59:57.356 --> 59:59.024
I'm breaking up with you.

59:59.058 --> 1:00:00.392
Do you like this sweater?

1:00:00.426 --> 1:00:02.261
Like, I just...
You know, I got it last

1:00:02.294 --> 1:00:04.096
week thinking I'd wear it
on the Cape for Christmas.

1:00:04.129 --> 1:00:05.397
And I... I just don't know
about it.

1:00:05.431 --> 1:00:08.067
Like maybe too loud, you know?

1:00:08.100 --> 1:00:09.501
- It's fine. I'm breaking up with you.
- You know,

1:00:09.535 --> 1:00:11.036
I also don't really
know if it's my color.

1:00:11.070 --> 1:00:12.838
I don't want to be
with you anymore!

1:00:14.073 --> 1:00:15.307
Wait, what?

1:00:16.408 --> 1:00:17.343
You heard me.

1:00:18.978 --> 1:00:20.212
Since when?

1:00:22.014 --> 1:00:23.215
Since right before Danny.

1:00:24.917 --> 1:00:26.852
That was like a year ago.

1:00:26.885 --> 1:00:28.520
I know.

1:00:28.554 --> 1:00:31.357
I felt like I owed it to you
for getting me through that.

1:00:31.390 --> 1:00:32.491
Owed it to me?

1:00:32.524 --> 1:00:33.192
Yeah.

1:00:34.393 --> 1:00:37.196
Baby, come on, you're stressed.

1:00:37.229 --> 1:00:38.897
- Yes, but...
- You know what I think?

1:00:38.931 --> 1:00:41.133
I think that...

1:00:41.166 --> 1:00:44.003
today has put
a lot of strain on you

1:00:44.036 --> 1:00:46.205
and you're reacting
to all the craziness.

1:00:46.238 --> 1:00:48.140
No, no, I just...

1:00:48.173 --> 1:00:49.208
Oh, God.

1:00:50.276 --> 1:00:52.311
- I'm so sorry.
- Baby?

1:00:52.344 --> 1:00:53.345
All of our lives got planned out

1:00:53.379 --> 1:00:55.314
before I had a chance
to really think about it.

1:00:55.347 --> 1:00:56.515
Who's, who's, who's,
who's planning?

1:00:56.548 --> 1:00:58.050
You!

1:00:58.083 --> 1:01:00.486
It's so dumb
that I don't want this.

1:01:01.453 --> 1:01:03.389
I'm so sorry
that I don't want this.

1:01:03.422 --> 1:01:06.392
Okay, by "this" you mean me?

1:01:13.565 --> 1:01:17.369
Uh, so you were staying
with me out of...

1:01:17.403 --> 1:01:19.004
out of what?

1:01:19.038 --> 1:01:20.072
Politeness?

1:01:20.973 --> 1:01:22.007
Expectation.

1:01:25.177 --> 1:01:28.247
Was that a,
was that a pity blowjob?

1:01:29.415 --> 1:01:30.949
- Yes.
- That's,

1:01:30.983 --> 1:01:32.184
that's really weird.

1:01:32.217 --> 1:01:34.219
I'm sorry.

1:01:34.253 --> 1:01:35.954
Do you love me?

1:01:35.988 --> 1:01:37.289
I'm sorry.

1:01:37.323 --> 1:01:38.390
Because, you know, I've...

1:01:40.259 --> 1:01:41.994
I...

1:01:42.027 --> 1:01:43.329
was going to...

1:01:46.498 --> 1:01:48.133
Uh, I...

1:01:49.601 --> 1:01:52.204
was going to...

1:01:53.305 --> 1:01:54.907
ask you.

1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:57.576
Uh, I was just waiting
for the right time.

1:02:00.045 --> 1:02:01.180
I know you were.

1:02:02.414 --> 1:02:04.516
I can't let you do that,
I'm so sorry.

1:02:04.550 --> 1:02:06.285
Say something else.

1:02:06.318 --> 1:02:08.987
All right, because "I'm sorry"
just doesn't cut it.

1:02:09.021 --> 1:02:10.489
Sadie.

1:02:10.522 --> 1:02:12.424
Please, Sadie.

1:02:12.458 --> 1:02:14.526
I'm saving us both time.

1:02:49.528 --> 1:02:52.131
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

1:02:52.164 --> 1:02:53.298
Excuse me?

1:02:53.332 --> 1:02:54.500
<i>I told you I needed you here.</i>

1:02:54.533 --> 1:02:56.135
<i>That was over 40 minutes ago.</i>

1:02:56.168 --> 1:02:58.103
<i>So I'll ask again,
where are you?</i>

1:02:58.137 --> 1:02:59.706
<i>What is your ETA?</i>

1:02:59.739 --> 1:03:02.241
Uh, never, actually.

1:03:02.274 --> 1:03:04.243
<i>Is that a joke?
We need to bring something</i>

1:03:04.276 --> 1:03:06.545
<i>completely new to the client!</i>

1:03:06.578 --> 1:03:08.580
Yeah, so call Ruby.

1:03:08.614 --> 1:03:10.349
You should be using her work.

1:03:10.382 --> 1:03:12.584
<i>Who the hell is Ruby?</i>

1:03:12.618 --> 1:03:14.654
The junior you've been ignoring.

1:03:14.687 --> 1:03:17.256
<i>You're just pawning work
off on a junior, huh?</i>

1:03:17.289 --> 1:03:20.092
No, I'm telling you
how to save your ass!

1:03:20.125 --> 1:03:21.694
Her renderings are on my desk!

1:03:21.728 --> 1:03:23.730
<i>I'll get you fired,
you know that?</i>

1:03:23.763 --> 1:03:25.197
Oh, great, you do that.

1:03:25.230 --> 1:03:26.633
<i>Great? At your age?</i>

1:03:26.666 --> 1:03:28.467
Oh, my age?

1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:30.202
<i>Yeah, you'll never find a job</i>

1:03:30.235 --> 1:03:31.370
<i>in this industry!</i>

1:03:31.403 --> 1:03:33.439
<i>You are a fucking dinosaur!</i>

1:03:33.472 --> 1:03:35.441
<i>I need you to get here, Frank!
Pull your head</i>

1:03:35.474 --> 1:03:38.711
<i>out of your wrinkled ass
and get here now!</i>

1:03:38.745 --> 1:03:42.281
No. I gave you everything
you needed for that deck

1:03:42.314 --> 1:03:44.550
and now you can go clean up
your own fucking mess.

1:03:44.583 --> 1:03:46.719
- I quit!
- <i>What?</i>

1:03:46.753 --> 1:03:49.421
I should have quit a year ago.

1:03:49.455 --> 1:03:51.123
Hey, have fun

1:03:51.156 --> 1:03:53.091
pitching against Gray, Steve-o.

1:03:56.395 --> 1:03:58.063
Fuck you, squirrel!

1:04:41.841 --> 1:04:43.375
Who are you looking for?

1:04:45.544 --> 1:04:48.146
I need, uh, I...

1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:50.182
I'm looking for Sebastian.

1:04:50.215 --> 1:04:52.384
You just missed him.
He left this morning.

1:04:52.417 --> 1:04:54.687
- He, he left?
- Yeah.

1:04:54.721 --> 1:04:56.288
Little nomad.

1:04:56.321 --> 1:04:57.523
He read my cards.

1:04:57.556 --> 1:04:58.557
Anything good?

1:04:58.590 --> 1:05:00.359
Change.

1:05:00.392 --> 1:05:01.560
A lot of change.

1:05:01.593 --> 1:05:04.162
- Change is good.
- Yeah.

1:05:04.196 --> 1:05:06.498
Yeah, I, I just need to ask him
a question, okay?

1:05:06.532 --> 1:05:07.834
Do you know here he is?

1:05:07.867 --> 1:05:11.470
No, I'm afraid I don't.

1:05:11.503 --> 1:05:13.338
Oh, God.

1:05:15.107 --> 1:05:16.475
Hey.

1:05:16.508 --> 1:05:18.176
You okay?

1:05:18.210 --> 1:05:19.111
I don't think I am.

1:05:20.379 --> 1:05:21.513
Just breathe, yeah?

1:05:23.549 --> 1:05:24.583
Good.

1:05:26.485 --> 1:05:27.619
Have you ever?

1:05:28.888 --> 1:05:32.825
I started to feel
my life squeeze in on me.

1:05:33.793 --> 1:05:38.263
Like, like my choices were
starting to suffocate me.

1:05:38.297 --> 1:05:39.699
Does that makes sense?

1:05:39.732 --> 1:05:41.133
No.

1:05:41.166 --> 1:05:43.670
- Okay.
- Um.

1:05:43.703 --> 1:05:45.604
Do you need some water?

1:05:47.573 --> 1:05:49.174
Yes.

1:05:51.143 --> 1:05:52.110
Wow.

1:05:53.178 --> 1:05:54.346
This is...

1:05:54.379 --> 1:05:55.480
I know,

1:05:55.514 --> 1:05:56.582
it's crazy.

1:05:58.317 --> 1:05:59.384
Are you still breathing?

1:06:01.219 --> 1:06:03.455
Yeah, sorry, uh.

1:06:03.488 --> 1:06:05.190
My dad has panic attacks too.

1:06:05.223 --> 1:06:06.358
Is that what that is?

1:06:07.559 --> 1:06:09.662
Well, this may surprise you.

1:06:09.696 --> 1:06:11.463
I am not a medical doctor.

1:06:12.598 --> 1:06:14.801
But, yeah,
you seem pretty panicked.

1:06:16.268 --> 1:06:17.603
Thanks for this.

1:06:17.637 --> 1:06:18.604
Of course.

1:06:19.806 --> 1:06:21.540
Um.

1:06:21.573 --> 1:06:23.342
What's your name?

1:06:23.375 --> 1:06:24.309
Cassie.

1:06:24.343 --> 1:06:25.912
Thank you, Cassie.

1:06:25.945 --> 1:06:27.245
It's better.

1:06:28.447 --> 1:06:31.149
Jesus, that was weird.

1:06:31.183 --> 1:06:33.485
Sebastian will circle back
eventually.

1:06:34.486 --> 1:06:36.555
He always does.

1:06:36.588 --> 1:06:38.357
So, uh,

1:06:38.390 --> 1:06:40.392
what's the deal with
the things on the ceiling?

1:06:40.425 --> 1:06:41.593
Oh, this is where I rehearse.

1:06:43.261 --> 1:06:44.363
For what?

1:06:44.396 --> 1:06:46.733
I'm an aerialist.

1:06:46.766 --> 1:06:48.433
Uh...

1:06:48.467 --> 1:06:49.902
Like in the circus.

1:06:50.803 --> 1:06:53.840
I do tricks on these bad boys.

1:06:53.873 --> 1:06:56.541
So you ran away
and joined the circus.

1:06:57.844 --> 1:06:59.344
Is that so hard to believe?

1:07:00.379 --> 1:07:01.781
Yeah, who actually does that?

1:07:02.949 --> 1:07:03.850
Me.

1:07:05.217 --> 1:07:06.318
Okay.

1:07:06.351 --> 1:07:08.553
Do you live around here?

1:07:08.587 --> 1:07:10.555
I grew up here.

1:07:10.589 --> 1:07:11.924
I live, uh...

1:07:13.392 --> 1:07:15.460
I'm in Westchester now.

1:07:15.494 --> 1:07:18.497
What are you doing slumming it
in Bushwick?

1:07:18.530 --> 1:07:21.934
Uh, recapturing my youth,
I suppose.

1:07:23.301 --> 1:07:25.437
Interesting.

1:07:25.470 --> 1:07:26.438
Where you from?

1:07:28.808 --> 1:07:29.742
Brooklyn.

1:07:31.276 --> 1:07:32.611
Originally?

1:07:32.645 --> 1:07:33.612
No.

1:07:35.447 --> 1:07:36.481
New Mexico.

1:07:36.515 --> 1:07:38.350
I knew it.

1:07:38.383 --> 1:07:40.485
You're too nice to be from here.

1:07:40.519 --> 1:07:41.688
I have to pee.

1:07:41.721 --> 1:07:42.922
Be back in a sec.

1:07:48.027 --> 1:07:49.428
Door open.

1:07:49.461 --> 1:07:51.463
Latch is broken.

1:07:51.496 --> 1:07:53.700
Uh, I'm a stranger.

1:07:53.733 --> 1:07:55.333
That's a bold choice.

1:07:56.636 --> 1:07:58.270
You remind me of my dad.

1:07:58.971 --> 1:08:00.605
Your dad.

1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:01.908
That hurt.

1:08:05.544 --> 1:08:08.580
So, like, what, do you flip
around on those things?

1:08:09.514 --> 1:08:12.551
Yeah, I do trapeze too.

1:08:12.584 --> 1:08:14.854
- Interesting, I'd like to see that.
- Oh.

1:08:14.887 --> 1:08:17.957
You forgot all about
poor Sebastian, haven't you?

1:08:17.990 --> 1:08:19.992
Feeling much better, eh?

1:08:20.026 --> 1:08:21.794
Yeah,
suddenly feeling pretty good.

1:08:21.828 --> 1:08:24.630
Oh, I bet you are.

1:08:24.664 --> 1:08:25.832
You're fresh.

1:08:27.867 --> 1:08:30.569
Are you trying to hit on me?

1:08:32.537 --> 1:08:33.673
Mm.

1:08:35.808 --> 1:08:36.909
Are you married?

1:08:40.980 --> 1:08:42.949
You're too old for me anyway.

1:08:44.549 --> 1:08:45.517
Ouch.

1:08:46.953 --> 1:08:49.421
Does age really matter
anymore though?

1:08:49.454 --> 1:08:51.758
Probably means
I'd give you a heart attack.

1:08:51.791 --> 1:08:53.458
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

1:08:53.492 --> 1:08:54.961
Oh.

1:08:54.994 --> 1:08:57.797
Fresh, Mister
"I just had a panic attack."

1:08:57.830 --> 1:08:59.866
I don't even know your name.

1:08:59.899 --> 1:09:01.067
It's Frank.

1:09:01.100 --> 1:09:02.601
Well, Frank,

1:09:02.635 --> 1:09:05.403
I think you might
have mistook my kindness.

1:09:07.774 --> 1:09:08.875
I, uh...

1:09:09.909 --> 1:09:12.078
I can't help myself.

1:09:12.111 --> 1:09:13.880
I'm going to show you a trick.

1:09:13.913 --> 1:09:15.580
Are you ready?

1:09:15.614 --> 1:09:16.849
As ready as I'll ever be.

1:09:19.451 --> 1:09:20.519
Bah-dah.

1:09:21.888 --> 1:09:23.488
No.

1:09:23.522 --> 1:09:24.724
No!

1:09:41.540 --> 1:09:42.507
No!

1:09:42.541 --> 1:09:43.843
No! No!

1:09:43.876 --> 1:09:44.877
No!

1:09:50.950 --> 1:09:53.451
Did I do something wrong?

1:10:04.864 --> 1:10:05.832
Okay.

1:10:08.533 --> 1:10:10.435
Why are you crying?

1:10:10.468 --> 1:10:12.038
You did this to him.

1:10:14.106 --> 1:10:15.373
I didn't.

1:10:16.776 --> 1:10:18.110
Yes, yes.

1:10:18.144 --> 1:10:19.511
Please, hurry.

1:10:24.917 --> 1:10:26.719
Please.

1:10:28.453 --> 1:10:33.059
Okay,
you're freaking me out, Frank.

1:10:39.799 --> 1:10:40.833
Are you okay?

1:10:41.868 --> 1:10:44.369
No, I'm not okay.

1:10:46.538 --> 1:10:48.074
I'm sorry.

1:10:50.943 --> 1:10:51.944
Here you go.

1:10:51.978 --> 1:10:53.145
Good for what ails you.

1:10:56.481 --> 1:10:58.050
I just really broke his heart.

1:10:58.084 --> 1:10:59.886
Like crushed it.

1:10:59.919 --> 1:11:01.954
Yes, I suspect that you did.

1:11:01.988 --> 1:11:03.956
He's such a good guy.

1:11:03.990 --> 1:11:05.691
Yes, he is.

1:11:05.725 --> 1:11:07.559
That doesn't mean
you have to love him.

1:11:08.526 --> 1:11:09.862
I feel crazy.

1:11:09.896 --> 1:11:11.731
Why did I just do that?

1:11:11.764 --> 1:11:13.032
Because you're smart.

1:11:21.606 --> 1:11:23.209
Why did you marry Daddy?

1:11:23.242 --> 1:11:25.711
Oh, Jesus.

1:11:25.745 --> 1:11:26.879
You loved him, right?

1:11:26.913 --> 1:11:27.914
Yes.

1:11:28.881 --> 1:11:30.515
He and I were...

1:11:32.218 --> 1:11:33.853
For a while it was really good.

1:11:34.921 --> 1:11:36.488
We were a really good team.

1:11:37.823 --> 1:11:38.858
Do you regret it?

1:11:39.792 --> 1:11:41.060
Giving up your job and having...

1:11:41.093 --> 1:11:43.062
No, of course not.

1:11:44.130 --> 1:11:46.198
I loved being a mother so much.

1:11:46.232 --> 1:11:48.634
So much more than I ever
thought that I would.

1:11:50.703 --> 1:11:52.537
I love you three
more than I can say.

1:11:54.606 --> 1:11:55.507
Right.

1:11:56.608 --> 1:11:58.510
Not to wax poetic but...

1:11:58.543 --> 1:12:00.545
you land where
you're supposed to land.

1:12:02.915 --> 1:12:04.717
I have never been by myself.

1:12:05.785 --> 1:12:07.552
Isn't that crazy?

1:12:07.585 --> 1:12:08.721
Yes, it is.

1:12:11.891 --> 1:12:14.860
Breaking up with someone right
before the holidays is so...

1:12:17.529 --> 1:12:19.098
It's cold...

1:12:19.131 --> 1:12:20.498
I'm a cold bitch.

1:12:20.532 --> 1:12:22.268
Screw the holidays.

1:12:22.301 --> 1:12:23.903
You shouldn't stay with someone

1:12:23.936 --> 1:12:25.938
because the timing
feels inconvenient.

1:12:25.972 --> 1:12:27.707
Right? Okay.

1:12:27.740 --> 1:12:28.808
Listen to me.

1:12:29.842 --> 1:12:32.945
Don't ever stay
with anyone out of obligation.

1:12:32.979 --> 1:12:35.781
You can choose to stay and work
on something that's broken

1:12:35.815 --> 1:12:38.818
but that's a choice
and not a given.

1:12:39.719 --> 1:12:41.153
It's not the fucking '50s,
you know?

1:12:44.991 --> 1:12:45.891
Okay.

1:13:45.918 --> 1:13:47.053
Thanks for picking me up.

1:13:48.754 --> 1:13:49.789
What happened to you?

1:13:51.357 --> 1:13:53.359
I crashed the car.

1:13:53.392 --> 1:13:55.127
Are you on drugs?

1:13:55.161 --> 1:13:57.663
No. I'm about to take some.

1:14:04.336 --> 1:14:05.704
Are you crying?

1:14:07.039 --> 1:14:08.707
Yes.

1:14:08.741 --> 1:14:09.842
Are you crying?

1:14:11.310 --> 1:14:12.344
Yes.

1:14:16.849 --> 1:14:17.917
Are you having a breakdown?

1:14:19.151 --> 1:14:20.753
Hmm.

1:14:20.786 --> 1:14:21.754
Maybe.

1:14:23.155 --> 1:14:25.091
Definitely.

1:14:26.292 --> 1:14:27.860
Just quit my job today.

1:14:29.295 --> 1:14:30.996
- It's Sunday.
- Yeah,

1:14:31.030 --> 1:14:33.065
advertising
doesn't take any days off.

1:14:34.834 --> 1:14:36.068
And it's probably for the best.

1:14:39.338 --> 1:14:40.773
I keep seeing Danny.

1:14:45.678 --> 1:14:46.946
Can we go?

1:14:59.825 --> 1:15:01.160
Why are you in Brooklyn?

1:15:02.128 --> 1:15:04.130
Soul searching.

1:15:05.898 --> 1:15:06.832
Fair enough.

1:15:07.900 --> 1:15:09.135
Why were you in Brooklyn?

1:15:10.970 --> 1:15:12.037
Uh, Darla.

1:15:13.839 --> 1:15:15.674
Uh, she ended things with me.

1:15:16.475 --> 1:15:17.776
Oh, sorry.

1:15:18.878 --> 1:15:20.379
It's probably
for the best, so...

1:15:22.214 --> 1:15:24.416
I really am okay with it,
you and her.

1:15:24.450 --> 1:15:27.153
That is so confusing for me.

1:15:28.087 --> 1:15:30.789
Like, why couldn't you
have done that for Danny?

1:15:30.823 --> 1:15:32.658
Fuck, I don't know.

1:15:33.826 --> 1:15:34.727
Mm.

1:15:36.095 --> 1:15:37.196
I wish I had.

1:15:38.230 --> 1:15:39.999
Don't take all of those, okay?

1:15:40.032 --> 1:15:42.768
The last thing I need is
you with an opioid problem.

1:15:42.801 --> 1:15:43.769
Agreed.

1:15:45.104 --> 1:15:46.739
Put your goddamn seatbelt on.

1:15:54.813 --> 1:15:56.182
This is bullshit.

1:15:58.384 --> 1:15:59.785
Oh, bullshit, posed.

1:15:59.818 --> 1:16:01.320
- You get in that one.
- Mm, mm.

1:16:01.353 --> 1:16:04.890
Yeah, uh, after I found out
about the neighbor.

1:16:04.924 --> 1:16:06.258
Mrs. Anderson?

1:16:06.292 --> 1:16:08.427
Oh, yeah,
they screwed right after Danny.

1:16:09.461 --> 1:16:11.363
That's when that
all started up again.

1:16:11.397 --> 1:16:13.399
Again? Gross!

1:16:13.432 --> 1:16:15.301
- You know what though?
- What?

1:16:15.334 --> 1:16:16.802
I don't really care.

1:16:16.835 --> 1:16:19.038
I had some sexy sex myself.

1:16:19.071 --> 1:16:20.739
Mom.

1:16:20.773 --> 1:16:22.341
Years of his bullshit,

1:16:22.374 --> 1:16:25.077
I deserve a little
something for myself.

1:16:25.110 --> 1:16:27.846
I deserve to orgasm
multiple times.

1:16:29.215 --> 1:16:32.251
That's nice, I'm glad.

1:16:32.284 --> 1:16:33.986
What's wrong with your face?

1:16:34.019 --> 1:16:36.121
Nothing,
what's wrong with yours?

1:16:36.155 --> 1:16:37.289
- Are you hurt.
- Car accident,

1:16:37.323 --> 1:16:38.390
I'm fine.

1:16:38.424 --> 1:16:40.326
What is happening?

1:16:40.359 --> 1:16:42.161
What is all of this?

1:16:42.194 --> 1:16:43.796
Crafts.

1:16:43.829 --> 1:16:45.965
We're doing crafts.

1:16:46.932 --> 1:16:48.367
Car accident?

1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:50.936
Yeah, what kind of crafts?

1:16:50.970 --> 1:16:53.005
I'm ripping shit up.

1:16:53.038 --> 1:16:56.942
Mom decided to repurpose
my anniversary gift to you guys.

1:16:56.976 --> 1:16:59.178
Are you drunk?

1:17:00.145 --> 1:17:02.481
Yep.

1:17:02.514 --> 1:17:04.350
Cool, I'm going to go.

1:17:04.383 --> 1:17:07.186
No, no, no, honey, don't go,
don't go, don't go, no, no.

1:17:07.219 --> 1:17:09.021
I have had the shittiest day,
okay?

1:17:09.054 --> 1:17:10.923
And I can already tell
by this situation

1:17:10.956 --> 1:17:12.224
it's just going
to get ten times...

1:17:12.258 --> 1:17:14.226
Can we,
can we talk before you go?

1:17:14.260 --> 1:17:15.394
Like outside?

1:17:15.427 --> 1:17:16.528
Why?

1:17:20.232 --> 1:17:21.200
Fine.

1:17:22.434 --> 1:17:23.335
Katy?

1:17:23.369 --> 1:17:25.170
What?

1:17:25.204 --> 1:17:26.438
Be nice to your sister.

1:17:33.145 --> 1:17:35.314
God.

1:17:37.383 --> 1:17:38.417
Should we go out there?

1:17:39.618 --> 1:17:41.120
Yeah, they'll take care of it.

1:17:52.197 --> 1:17:53.165
Jesus!

1:17:53.198 --> 1:17:54.133
Why did you do that?

1:17:54.166 --> 1:17:55.467
Because I am riled up

1:17:55.501 --> 1:17:58.170
and I don't want
to take it out on you.

1:17:58.203 --> 1:18:00.539
You can yell at me
if that'll make you feel better.

1:18:00.572 --> 1:18:02.074
It won't!

1:18:09.882 --> 1:18:11.317
That's crazy what you just did.

1:18:13.152 --> 1:18:14.420
You need an ice pack?

1:18:14.453 --> 1:18:15.954
You look like shit.

1:18:17.056 --> 1:18:18.490
No.

1:18:19.659 --> 1:18:21.026
What happened to the car?

1:18:23.128 --> 1:18:24.063
Gone.

1:18:26.131 --> 1:18:27.299
Job gone.

1:18:28.300 --> 1:18:29.368
Quite the day.

1:18:30.402 --> 1:18:31.337
Yeah.

1:18:33.372 --> 1:18:35.974
I really fucked it all up, huh?

1:18:36.008 --> 1:18:37.276
Oh, screw the job.

1:18:37.309 --> 1:18:39.244
You hated that job.

1:18:39.278 --> 1:18:40.346
No, like,

1:18:41.580 --> 1:18:42.581
I fucked it up.

1:18:44.350 --> 1:18:45.451
Us.

1:18:46.653 --> 1:18:48.087
Yeah.

1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:49.221
Yes.

1:18:51.390 --> 1:18:52.458
Can we...?

1:18:57.096 --> 1:18:58.063
Can we talk about last night?

1:18:58.097 --> 1:18:59.898
I would rather not.

1:18:59.932 --> 1:19:01.200
It's the holidays and...

1:19:03.168 --> 1:19:04.303
I'm a mess.

1:19:07.339 --> 1:19:09.141
It was so much better
before Danny.

1:19:11.944 --> 1:19:13.612
We peppered
a few good years in there.

1:19:21.253 --> 1:19:22.321
I hate the holidays

1:19:23.322 --> 1:19:24.289
Oh, me too.

1:19:25.424 --> 1:19:27.126
I don't think Christmas
will ever feel right again.

1:19:27.159 --> 1:19:29.428
We don't have to do this, okay?

1:19:31.029 --> 1:19:34.400
Kaitlin,
I feel really messed up.

1:19:34.433 --> 1:19:35.367
Okay.

1:19:37.704 --> 1:19:39.371
So you've said.

1:19:39.405 --> 1:19:41.039
I want to be able
to tell you those things

1:19:41.073 --> 1:19:42.374
- because I feel like if Danny...
- I know.

1:19:42.408 --> 1:19:43.976
...could've told us...

1:19:44.977 --> 1:19:46.011
I know.

1:19:49.348 --> 1:19:51.116
I hate pretending we're okay.

1:19:52.584 --> 1:19:53.619
I know.

1:19:59.291 --> 1:20:00.526
I hate that he's...

1:20:03.996 --> 1:20:05.264
That he's, uh...

1:20:06.365 --> 1:20:08.033
It's not your fault,
you know that.

1:20:12.070 --> 1:20:13.071
Yeah.

1:20:14.173 --> 1:20:15.307
You don't believe that.

1:20:22.114 --> 1:20:24.116
I don't remember liking myself.

1:20:26.084 --> 1:20:27.219
Isn't that sad?

1:20:30.422 --> 1:20:31.323
Yeah.

1:20:32.591 --> 1:20:34.993
Ugh, I just want to run away
from everything!

1:20:37.596 --> 1:20:39.598
I woke up this morning
and I know

1:20:39.632 --> 1:20:41.567
that I'm on this path.

1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:45.437
This very clear and very
thought out path, like...

1:20:45.471 --> 1:20:47.372
I carved the shit out
of this path.

1:20:47.406 --> 1:20:49.107
It is my path and I don't...

1:20:52.244 --> 1:20:53.545
I don't want it anymore.

1:20:56.248 --> 1:20:57.684
So don't go down that path.

1:21:00.619 --> 1:21:02.054
I broke up with Patrick.

1:21:03.222 --> 1:21:04.757
Good.

1:21:04.791 --> 1:21:06.325
He was the worst.

1:21:11.597 --> 1:21:13.265
He wore an apron.

1:21:16.335 --> 1:21:18.805
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1:21:18.838 --> 1:21:20.707
Oh, Jesus.

1:21:20.740 --> 1:21:22.508
I look like a cow,
get rid of that.

1:21:22.541 --> 1:21:24.644
Oh, I think
you look good in this.

1:21:24.677 --> 1:21:28.347
- Oh, fat, I hate that.
- Cute, so cute.

1:21:28.380 --> 1:21:29.649
- Look at that little...
- It is not

1:21:29.682 --> 1:21:31.316
- cute.
- Flower pattern.

1:21:31.350 --> 1:21:32.819
It's irresistible.

1:21:32.852 --> 1:21:34.419
Not little.

1:22:32.311 --> 1:22:35.247
Oh, I need to clean this up.

1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:37.750
- God, the Andersons are truly the worst.
- Mm-hmm.

1:22:40.787 --> 1:22:42.354
Dad fucked that lady.

1:22:43.756 --> 1:22:44.857
Gross.

1:22:44.891 --> 1:22:46.158
I know.

1:22:46.191 --> 1:22:47.860
Poor Mom.

1:22:47.894 --> 1:22:49.862
Whatever, Mom's been
banging Dad's trainer.

1:22:51.664 --> 1:22:52.732
Ray?

1:22:52.765 --> 1:22:54.734
Uh-huh. Yeah,

1:22:54.767 --> 1:22:56.501
her massages have been
ending happily.

1:22:56.535 --> 1:22:58.236
Oh.

1:23:01.540 --> 1:23:02.441
Crazy.

1:23:02.474 --> 1:23:04.409
He's like way young.

1:23:04.443 --> 1:23:05.310
So?

1:23:06.311 --> 1:23:07.747
Mom's hot.

1:23:09.849 --> 1:23:11.450
How long has that been going on?

1:23:12.719 --> 1:23:13.753
I have no idea.

1:23:23.261 --> 1:23:24.596
I'm going to go
take care of that.

1:23:28.266 --> 1:23:29.534
What, what?

1:23:39.378 --> 1:23:40.680
Whoa.

1:23:47.285 --> 1:23:48.487
Oh.

1:24:11.443 --> 1:24:13.846
Nice toss!

1:24:18.383 --> 1:24:20.552
I fucking hate the holidays!

1:24:21.688 --> 1:24:22.822
Yeah, they suck!

1:24:31.798 --> 1:24:33.298
I'm glad you got off that path.

1:24:35.001 --> 1:24:36.836
- Yeah.
- It was a really shitty path.

1:24:38.570 --> 1:24:39.939
Thanks.

1:25:02.594 --> 1:25:03.863
I'll be better, Kath.

1:25:05.064 --> 1:25:06.565
I can be better.

1:25:23.415 --> 1:25:24.984
I think I have to leave you.

1:25:28.755 --> 1:25:29.989
You know that I do.

1:25:48.775 --> 1:25:49.776
Oh.

1:26:39.926 --> 1:26:42.360
I do love you, you know.

1:26:42.394 --> 1:26:43.395
I know.

1:26:44.130 --> 1:26:45.665
I love you too.

1:26:47.700 --> 1:26:49.467
It doesn't mean
we should be together.

1:27:09.655 --> 1:27:10.622
Hi.

1:27:11.590 --> 1:27:12.591
Are you okay, Dad?

1:27:49.729 --> 1:27:50.763
You want a cigarette?

1:27:55.701 --> 1:27:57.069
Or a bullet.

1:27:57.103 --> 1:27:58.704
Don't be melodramatic.

1:28:17.089 --> 1:28:19.125
Disgusting habit.

1:28:19.158 --> 1:28:20.192
I know.

1:28:24.830 --> 1:28:26.065
Hey, I know something that might

1:28:26.098 --> 1:28:27.599
make you feel a little better.

1:28:28.935 --> 1:28:30.002
Ready?

1:28:32.171 --> 1:28:33.072
A drive.

1:28:34.006 --> 1:28:35.942
A drive to clear your head.

1:28:35.975 --> 1:28:37.810
In your POS car?

1:28:37.843 --> 1:28:39.511
Yeah.

1:28:39.544 --> 1:28:41.681
You totaled the nice one,
so yeah.

1:28:47.119 --> 1:28:48.220
Take it or leave it.

1:29:02.835 --> 1:29:03.869
Ow.

1:29:08.808 --> 1:29:09.875
Hey, are you hungry?

1:29:11.609 --> 1:29:12.510
I could eat.

1:29:13.611 --> 1:29:14.546
Waffles?

1:29:15.613 --> 1:29:16.614
Yeah, sure.

1:29:19.051 --> 1:29:20.953
Uh, just give me
one minute though.

1:29:20.987 --> 1:29:22.088
One sec.

1:29:24.757 --> 1:29:25.992
Be back in a bit, guys.

1:29:27.559 --> 1:29:28.828
Love you!

1:29:40.773 --> 1:29:41.841
Now we can go.

1:29:44.343 --> 1:29:46.112
You are such a goober.

1:29:46.145 --> 1:29:48.647
Yeah, I get it from my old man.

1:29:48.681 --> 1:29:50.816
Yeah, you do.

1:29:50.850 --> 1:29:54.020
My old, old, old man.

1:29:56.922 --> 1:29:59.025
- I really do want a waffle.
- Yeah.

1:29:59.058 --> 1:30:00.525
Please don't break my car.

1:30:02.194 --> 1:30:04.196
Oh, it stinks in here.

1:30:04.230 --> 1:30:06.766
- It smells like your puke.
- Oh,

1:30:06.799 --> 1:30:09.201
God, I didn't know
it smelled that bad.

1:30:09.235 --> 1:30:11.270
You puked a lot last night.

1:30:11.303 --> 1:30:12.838
I don't think you understand.

1:30:12.872 --> 1:30:14.173
- All right.
- It was a lot.

1:30:14.206 --> 1:30:15.908
You know,
is this safe now?

1:30:15.941 --> 1:30:17.209
- Yes.
- I have to concentrate.

1:30:17.243 --> 1:30:19.045
- Holy...
- It's fine.

1:30:19.945 --> 1:30:21.847
- Okay, it's my turn!
- Oh, my God!

1:30:21.881 --> 1:30:23.049
Okay, easy!

1:30:23.082 --> 1:30:24.917
Oh, my God, okay!

1:30:24.950 --> 1:30:26.352
Easy on the accelerator!

1:30:26.385 --> 1:30:27.853
That's the breaks!

1:30:27.887 --> 1:30:29.088
Oh, my God.

1:30:29.121 --> 1:30:30.256
Where's the clutch?

1:30:30.289 --> 1:30:31.157
There is no clutch,

1:30:31.190 --> 1:30:32.291
it's an automatic.

1:30:32.324 --> 1:30:33.359
What? Ah,

1:30:33.392 --> 1:30:34.860
come on!
