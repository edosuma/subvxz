07:58.700 --> 08:00.830
where you're just like,
"What's that about?"

08:00.900 --> 08:05.170
- Like, I have two numbers
for him, two different numbers.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.100
The first number,
he used for the first part.

08:08.170 --> 08:09.570
And then two days later,

08:09.640 --> 08:11.310
he's calling me
off of another number.

08:11.370 --> 08:14.340
- That's interesting
that he's got a second number.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.980
- Has he ever asked you
for money?

08:16.050 --> 08:17.810
- He's never asked me
for money, no.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.280
- Is most of
your communication voice,

08:19.350 --> 08:20.820
talking on the phone?

08:20.880 --> 08:24.020
- Most of it's
talking on the phone or texting.

08:24.090 --> 08:25.790
- He has no social media.

08:25.860 --> 08:27.460
- Yeah...
- That's crazy.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.160
- Which is strange.
- Zero social media.

08:29.230 --> 08:30.990
- But he's on PlentyOfFish.
- Yeah.

08:31.060 --> 08:33.590
- Can we see it,
his PlentyOfFish profile?

08:35.500 --> 08:37.600
- This is his profile.

08:37.669 --> 08:38.970
- Okay, here we go.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.429
- He's 5'10".

08:40.500 --> 08:42.070
Look, he's a Libra.

08:42.140 --> 08:43.970
Aren't you a Libra, Nev?
- I am a Libra.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.510
- Let's see those pictures.
- So wait, here.

08:45.580 --> 08:47.070
- Blow those up.

08:47.140 --> 08:50.340
- Oh, yeah, he looks like
a normal, nice guy.

08:50.410 --> 08:52.410
- Not a lot on his page.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.050
- All right.
- Okay.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.450
- All right, so...

08:55.520 --> 08:58.020
you've only seen
a few pictures of the guy.

08:58.090 --> 08:59.290
- Mm-hmm.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.960
- You only met him
three months ago.

09:01.020 --> 09:05.990
- So let's imagine
he's 200 pounds heavier

09:06.060 --> 09:07.300
than what he is.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.700
Would that be a deal breaker?

09:08.770 --> 09:11.170
- I don't really care
either way.

09:11.230 --> 09:12.770
I don't look for looks.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.770
I look for personality.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.110
I mean, if I found out
he was actually, like, married

09:18.170 --> 09:19.910
or in a relationship...

09:19.980 --> 09:20.710
- Right.

09:20.780 --> 09:22.210
- That would just do it.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.780
I would be like, "Done. Bye."

09:23.850 --> 09:25.350
- That'd be a deal breaker.

09:25.420 --> 09:27.180
- But I believe if you don't
take risks in life,

09:27.250 --> 09:28.680
how do you know?

09:28.750 --> 09:30.120
I mean, this guy could be
my soul mate.

09:32.060 --> 09:33.920
- I'd like to hope
this could work out.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.260
Send us an email

Nothing.

which is his phone numbers.

11:31.110 --> 11:32.940
Both 509 area code.

Spokane.

- But no information.

11:38.110 --> 11:39.310
- No address, no names.

11:39.380 --> 11:40.880
But it's Spokane 509.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.080
- Right, which means that
the other one's Spokane too.

11:43.150 --> 11:44.420
- Correct.

11:44.490 --> 11:46.190
- So why would
his recent phone number

11:46.260 --> 11:47.660
also be Spokane

11:47.720 --> 11:49.620
when he's supposed to be
living in Louisiana?

11:49.690 --> 11:51.130
- Suspect.
- Let's see what comes up...

11:51.190 --> 11:54.330
- All right, so the first number
is Spokane.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.860
And here comes
the second number.

No, relatives

12:25.900 --> 12:27.560

information on this guy.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.070
The only thing we have

12:31.130 --> 12:33.700
is that his phone numbers
are from Spokane.

12:33.770 --> 12:37.270
Maybe, instead of wasting
our time and her time

12:37.340 --> 12:38.970
by going
and basically telling her

12:39.040 --> 12:41.080

we should skip a few steps,

12:41.140 --> 12:43.110
just call him ourselves,

12:43.180 --> 12:46.480
and sort of see if we can get
a little bit more info.

12:46.550 --> 12:47.820
- You want to skip steps.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.080
- I want to find out
who this guy is,

12:49.150 --> 12:50.550
and I don't want
to waste any time.

12:50.620 --> 12:52.450

13:08.340 --> 13:11.810
at the behest of a young woman
named Colleen.

13:12.810 --> 13:15.240

not right now.

13:15.310 --> 13:17.180
Where are you, exactly?

13:19.580 --> 13:22.850
- So why does
your PlentyOfFish account

13:22.920 --> 13:26.190
still say
that you're in Washington?

13:27.720 --> 13:30.390
- And is there a good reason

13:30.460 --> 13:34.330
why you haven't gone to see
your fiancée in person?

13:42.670 --> 13:44.940
- Oh.
What do you mean?

13:46.980 --> 13:49.880
- Really?
What--in what way?

13:54.950 --> 13:58.490
- So yeah, I can understand
that came as quite a shock.

13:58.550 --> 14:00.960
- When did she tell you that
finally?

14:02.360 --> 14:03.690

14:03.760 --> 14:06.230
Was there anything else
that she lied about?

- How much have you sent her?

14:27.380 --> 14:28.750

They are.
Okay.

14:54.410 --> 14:55.640
- She's--

14:55.710 --> 14:57.040
- Well, if Tony's
telling the truth.

14:57.110 --> 14:58.880
- If he is, in fact,
sending her money,

14:58.950 --> 15:01.650
that is a big detail
that she left out.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.320
- Or that she lied
about her age.

15:03.390 --> 15:04.820
- She's crafty.

15:04.890 --> 15:06.450
- We need to grill Colleen
a little bit right now

15:06.520 --> 15:10.060
and find out if
what Tony's telling us is true,

15:10.130 --> 15:12.160
in which case she's got
some explaining to do.

15:12.230 --> 15:13.930
- Or is Tony lying more
to us

15:14.000 --> 15:16.360
to buy himself more time?

15:19.700 --> 15:20.970
- Perfectly rainy day

15:21.040 --> 15:24.170
to match the perfectly murky
situation

15:24.240 --> 15:25.310
we find ourselves in.

15:25.370 --> 15:27.110
Colleen definitely lied to us

15:27.180 --> 15:29.240
about how long
she was seeing Tony.

15:29.310 --> 15:31.250
She may have lied to him
about her age.

15:31.310 --> 15:34.550
- And she omitted the fact
that after she lost her job...

15:34.620 --> 15:35.780
- She hit him up.

15:35.850 --> 15:37.550
- She let him help
support her.

15:37.620 --> 15:39.020
- Well, so he says.

15:39.090 --> 15:42.190
He might have just been
inventing things to say

15:42.260 --> 15:44.790
that kind of, "Well,
I didn't show her who I was,

15:44.860 --> 15:47.630

about who she is."

15:47.700 --> 15:49.260
You know what I mean?
He--who knows?

- How are we gonna find out
who's telling the truth?

15:51.770 --> 15:53.000
- It's a house of mirrors.

15:53.070 --> 15:55.300
This show

16:02.510 --> 16:03.880
Have you heard from Tony?

16:03.950 --> 16:05.910
- Today? Yes.
- You did?

16:05.980 --> 16:07.980
- Normal "hi," "how you doing,"
"good morning."

16:08.050 --> 16:09.380
- "Good morning, beautiful"?

16:09.450 --> 16:11.150
- Yes, of course.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.850
- We do have some stuff
to talk about.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.060
- Let's just get to it.
- Yeah.

16:16.130 --> 16:17.890
So the first thing
we did was,

16:17.960 --> 16:19.790
we downloaded the pictures
that you'd sent us.

16:19.860 --> 16:21.260
We searched them,

16:21.330 --> 16:22.700
and we didn't get--

16:22.770 --> 16:24.670
- Nothing, no hits
on any of them.

16:24.730 --> 16:27.000
- Then we ran his phone numbers,

16:27.070 --> 16:28.370
and, interestingly,

16:28.440 --> 16:31.440
it came up with a name,
Tim [bleep].

16:31.510 --> 16:33.110
Is that a name
that you've ever heard?

16:33.180 --> 16:36.340
Both phone numbers
are Spokane area code...

16:36.410 --> 16:37.540
- Washington.

16:37.610 --> 16:39.110
- Which you knew.
- Yeah.

16:39.180 --> 16:41.020
- If he's in Louisiana
and he got a new phone number,

16:41.080 --> 16:43.750
it'd be weird that he would get
a Washington number

16:43.820 --> 16:45.290
and not a Louisiana number.

16:45.350 --> 16:46.550
- Yeah.

16:46.620 --> 16:49.460
- So that's most of
what we got.

16:49.530 --> 16:50.720
- We looked up everything,

16:50.790 --> 16:52.260
and we didn't find nothing.

16:52.330 --> 16:54.230
So we sort of thought,
"All right."

16:54.300 --> 16:56.460
If the point of being here
and helping you

16:56.530 --> 17:00.070

and bringing you guys together,

17:00.140 --> 17:03.000

that process,

17:03.070 --> 17:04.640
we called Tony.

17:04.710 --> 17:08.410

"Why, you know, haven't you

What's the hold-up?"

17:15.349 --> 17:17.720
And his answer
was very interesting.

17:17.790 --> 17:21.119
He said he has
some reservations.

17:21.190 --> 17:24.060
Has he ever mentioned
anything like that?

17:24.130 --> 17:25.030

17:25.089 --> 17:26.930

17:27.000 --> 17:30.230
- Now everything's coming out.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.670
- He said

17:31.730 --> 17:33.600
you had lied to him

17:33.670 --> 17:34.940

17:35.000 --> 17:37.040
and that you had said
you were 25.

17:37.110 --> 17:38.870
- My profile says 20.

17:38.940 --> 17:40.910
I never told him I was 25.

17:40.980 --> 17:43.510
In fact, I've been talking
about my 21st birthday

17:43.580 --> 17:45.410
for the last two months.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.720
- And you're not lying
to us right now?

17:48.780 --> 17:50.350
- No, not at all.

17:50.420 --> 17:53.320
- I wouldn't be so inclined
to believe him

17:53.390 --> 17:55.960
if our relationship
hadn't started

17:56.030 --> 17:58.030
with you kind of
telling us something

17:58.090 --> 17:59.260
that wasn't totally true.

17:59.330 --> 18:02.560
- Yeah.
I never told him I was 25.

18:02.630 --> 18:05.200
- He could just be
giving us BS excuses.

18:05.270 --> 18:09.140
But he also said
that you had lost your job...

18:09.210 --> 18:10.300
- Mm-hmm.

18:10.370 --> 18:11.940
- And started asking him
for money.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.480
- I never once asked him
for money.

18:15.540 --> 18:16.940
He's offered to send me money,

18:17.010 --> 18:18.380
but I've said no.

18:18.450 --> 18:20.850
And then he sent me
some money last week,

18:20.920 --> 18:22.280
but that's it.

18:22.350 --> 18:23.620
- So he did send you money.

18:23.690 --> 18:26.650
- Yes, it was only, like, $75.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.020
- Just the once?
- Yes.

18:28.090 --> 18:29.990
- I called him
right after I lost my job,

18:30.060 --> 18:31.560
and he was, "It's okay."

18:31.630 --> 18:32.660
You know, "It'll be fine.

18:32.730 --> 18:34.090
You'll find another job."

18:34.160 --> 18:35.700
He said, "I'm going
to send you some money.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.330
I'm sending you $75."

18:37.400 --> 18:40.200
So I have not received
any other money from him.

18:40.270 --> 18:42.240
I am dead honest on that.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.870

that he would have

18:43.940 --> 18:46.010
a different version
of the story.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.810
It's making it hard for us
to know who to believe.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.910

18:51.980 --> 18:53.310
running through my head
right now.

18:53.380 --> 18:58.120

the end of us?

I might have met my soul mate.

- I'm awesome.

25:56.910 --> 25:58.240
- All right, well,
that's nice.

25:58.310 --> 26:00.640
- No one has ever
walked out the door

26:00.710 --> 26:02.610
and said, "I'm awesome."

26:02.680 --> 26:04.680
- Nice to meet you finally.

26:04.750 --> 26:06.950
- Nice to finally meet you too.

26:09.020 --> 26:10.580
But why did you say

26:10.650 --> 26:12.220
that I told you I was 25?

26:12.290 --> 26:14.220
I've never once told you
I was 25.

26:14.290 --> 26:21.130
And when did you send me
hundreds of dollars?

26:21.200 --> 26:23.460
- I apologize.
I--

26:23.530 --> 26:24.760
Honestly, I was just scared.

26:24.830 --> 26:26.270
Um...

26:26.340 --> 26:29.370
I kind of just made it up
as I went along.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.270
It wasn't
the most honest thing to do.

26:32.340 --> 26:35.610
I have a lot
of self-esteem issues,

26:35.680 --> 26:37.880
and I was kind of insecure

26:37.950 --> 26:42.620
that you wouldn't accept me
for who I am.

26:42.680 --> 26:43.920
- Who are you?

26:43.990 --> 26:45.550
- Jeremy Antonio [bleep].

26:45.620 --> 26:49.460
- So your name is Jeremy,
but you went by Tony.

26:49.520 --> 26:52.190
- My middle name is Tony.

26:52.260 --> 26:55.030
- The phone number you have
is from Washington.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.100
Have you previously lived there?

26:57.170 --> 27:00.700
- When I was 18,
I moved to Washington.

27:00.770 --> 27:04.170
And I instantly loved
the place.

27:04.240 --> 27:06.110
I just always felt like

27:06.170 --> 27:09.440
I wish I would have
been born there.

27:09.510 --> 27:12.110
And I knew
I was gonna come back,

27:12.180 --> 27:14.510
but I wanted a reason to.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.580
- So that's why you were
looking to meet women

27:16.650 --> 27:18.590
in Spokane.

27:18.650 --> 27:19.820
- Yeah.

27:19.890 --> 27:22.820
- Why were you pretending to be

27:22.890 --> 27:25.860
this other guy on PlentyOfFish?

27:27.330 --> 27:29.230
- It wasn't
the most honest thing to do.

27:29.300 --> 27:33.170
I just wanted to see
if it would work.

27:33.240 --> 27:36.270
I'm not a stereotypical
black guy.

27:36.340 --> 27:39.970
It makes me more inclined
to date Caucasian women,

27:40.040 --> 27:42.810
because I feel like, you know,
I can be myself.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.580
I can dress like this.

27:44.650 --> 27:48.880
I can--I can watch
science fiction movies

27:48.950 --> 27:51.550
and do whatever it is
that I want to do.

27:51.620 --> 27:54.050
I don't want to be viewed
as a stereotype.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.690
- Do you find
that's your experience?

27:56.760 --> 27:58.390
- That's commonly the case.

27:58.460 --> 28:03.200
- So non-black women
generally sort of assume

28:03.270 --> 28:06.470
you're a certain type of person
because of your skin.

28:06.540 --> 28:07.930
- Yeah.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.970
- We have a lot in common.

28:10.040 --> 28:14.570
I mean, why wouldn't you let me
be the judge of everything?

28:16.180 --> 28:17.710
- I'm sorry, Colleen.

28:17.780 --> 28:22.720
I just--I just pray
that you can forgive me.

28:24.650 --> 28:26.850
- I really want to.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.190
Just got to promise me
no more lies.

28:29.260 --> 28:31.590
- I'll get on my knees
right now.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.470
Colleen,

28:39.530 --> 28:43.000
these last couple months
changed my life.

28:43.070 --> 28:45.570
I never want to lie to you.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.070
I just want to make you happy.

28:49.610 --> 28:51.110
I'm sorry.

28:51.180 --> 28:54.250
I'll do anything to keep
moving forward with you.

more forthcoming.

the impression

that that's the case.

36:42.620 --> 36:44.180
- Someone who's...
- Crazy.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.890
- Someone who's conflicted
about who they are.

36:46.960 --> 36:51.120
- Jeremy's identity
is a little foggy.

36:51.190 --> 36:52.730
- He needs to find his self.

36:52.790 --> 36:54.330
- Yes, I agree.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.630
- 'Cause in between
what he doing now and that--

36:56.700 --> 36:58.100
- Well, clearly,
he's confused,

36:58.170 --> 36:59.670
because you don't have to...

36:59.730 --> 37:01.300
- Lie.
What you lying for?

37:01.370 --> 37:02.270
- Right.

37:02.340 --> 37:04.570
- You're not
taking me away.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.270
You mean the world to me.

37:06.340 --> 37:09.940
- I love you.
[sniffles]

37:13.250 --> 37:16.950
-<i> Well, hopefully we can just</i>
<i> all put this behind us.</i>

37:21.220 --> 37:23.390
- This was new
for a lot of us--

37:23.460 --> 37:26.560
new situation for us
to be in, clearly.

37:26.630 --> 37:29.100
Unusual one for all of you.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.000
Colleen, I think
you have been very...

37:32.070 --> 37:33.800
- Understanding.
- Understanding and patient.

37:33.870 --> 37:34.830
- Mm-hmm.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.470
- And respectful of them

37:36.540 --> 37:38.770
and their relationship
as brother and sister.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.440
I'd like to just thank
all of you

37:41.510 --> 37:43.980
for sitting down
and having this conversation.

37:44.050 --> 37:46.380
This is not an easy one
to have.

37:46.450 --> 37:49.820
- Whatever y'all do,
however, whatever,

37:49.880 --> 37:52.080
that's totally up to y'all.

37:52.150 --> 37:53.690
I'ma still love my brother.

37:53.760 --> 37:57.020
And if you happen to become
one of the family members,

37:57.090 --> 37:58.690
I might have to deal
with you too.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.190
- [laughs]

38:00.260 --> 38:01.560
- I don't want
to take him away from you

38:01.630 --> 38:03.060
at all.

38:03.130 --> 38:05.030
I want you guys to have
a relationship.

38:05.100 --> 38:07.870
I want to get to know you,
you know,

38:07.940 --> 38:09.570
be able to hang around you,

38:09.640 --> 38:12.910
be able to have you over,
meet my family, you know?

38:12.970 --> 38:15.840
I never want
to take him away from you.

38:15.910 --> 38:18.880
- Thank you.

38:18.950 --> 38:20.350
Jeremy,
you just know how to--

38:20.420 --> 38:22.980
you just know how
to just--ugh.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.520
- He keeps it interesting.

38:25.590 --> 38:26.690
- Yeah, he does.

38:26.750 --> 38:28.650
- In terms of next steps,

38:28.720 --> 38:32.160
we'll probably head back
to our hotel with Colleen,

38:32.230 --> 38:36.100
let you guys talk
without all the cameras

38:36.160 --> 38:37.260
and discuss this
a little bit more

38:37.330 --> 38:38.930
if you choose to.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.600
So why don't you say good-bye
to Colleen for now?

38:41.670 --> 38:44.140
- Nice meeting you, Colleen.
- Nice meeting you.

38:44.210 --> 38:46.040
- I hope you get
what you're looking for.

38:46.110 --> 38:47.570
- I want to be around you guys.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.140
- Nice to meet you.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.780
We're all in one piece,

38:52.850 --> 38:54.980
so I'd say that went well.

38:55.050 --> 38:56.780
- It was so nice
meeting you.

38:56.850 --> 38:58.080
- All right.

38:58.150 --> 38:59.450
- Good luck.

39:33.820 --> 39:35.590

has been one of the best things.

39:40.060 --> 39:42.030
