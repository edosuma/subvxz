01:29.080 --> 01:31.071
Let's remember the energy.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.038
America had won the war.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.429
The depression was over.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.193
Sacrifice was over.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.078
The upsurge of life was contagious.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.797
We celebrated a moment
of collective inebriation

01:45.880 --> 01:48.030
that we would never know again.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.669
Nothing like it in all the years
that followed

01:51.760 --> 01:54.957
from our childhood
until tonight,

01:55.040 --> 01:58.589
the 45th reunion of our high school class.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.551
At 30 or 40, a gathering
of my old classmates

02:04.640 --> 02:08.633
would have been exactly the kind of thing
I'd have kept my nose out of.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.508
But at 62,
I found myself drawn to it

02:12.600 --> 02:15.672
as if in the crowd
of half-remembered faces

02:15.760 --> 02:19.469
I'd be closer to the mystery
at the heart of things,

02:19.560 --> 02:25.032
a magic trick that turned time past
into time present.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.359
The Swede.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.112
Swede Levov.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.591
During the war years, this was
a magical name in our neighborhood.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.077
Of the few fair-complexioned students
in our predominantly Jewish public school,

02:45.160 --> 02:50.473
none possessed the Viking mask
of this blue-eyed hero, the Swede.

02:50.560 --> 02:53.518
Big brother of my best friend, Jerry,

02:53.600 --> 02:58.151
born into our tribe
as Seymour Irving Levov,

02:58.280 --> 03:01.829
the greatest high school athlete
New Jersey had ever seen.

03:01.920 --> 03:06.232
Watching the Swede, people could forget
the way things actually were.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.151
We could forget the war.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.593
The Swede went off to the Marines in '44,

03:13.680 --> 03:16.672
just missing the end of the fighting,

03:16.800 --> 03:19.758
and came home to Dawn Dwyer,

03:19.840 --> 03:23.515
a plumber's daughter from Elizabeth,
who made it all the way

03:23.640 --> 03:27.633
to the Miss America pageant
in Atlantic City.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.917
A shiksa.
The Swede had done it.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.918
But before he could marry Dawn,
she had one great test to pass;

03:36.000 --> 03:39.436
She had to meet the old man,
the Swede's father,

03:39.520 --> 03:43.559
Lou Levov, founder and owner
of Newark Maid gloves.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.896
He hust wants to ask you
a couple of things, that's all.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.150
"That's all"?
Can't you answer for me?

03:48.240 --> 03:51.038
He wants to get to know you
and he's not an easy guy,

03:51.120 --> 03:54.715
- but if you stand your ground...
- Oh, Swede.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.439
He'll respect that.
He'll respect you for it.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.272
I'll be right there.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.429
Dawn, let's get down
to brass tacks.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.875
What do you people say
about Jews?

04:07.960 --> 04:10.076
My family doesn't talk much
about Jews.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.469
I don't mean that as an excuse.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.120
We don't talk much
about anything.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.269
But marrying a Jew
isn't a big deal.

04:17.399 --> 04:20.278
Until the issue
of what to raise the kids as.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.193
I would want our child
to be baptized, yes.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.477
Baptized? No.
That's a no.

04:27.440 --> 04:28.668
But...

04:30.040 --> 04:34.830
Baptism, it washes away original sin.
Without it, if they die, they go to limbo.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.032
Limbo, I don't know about,
but baptism, I can't allow.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.588
It's important to me,
Mr. Levov.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.352
All of the sacraments
are important.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.715
Like communion, the Eucharist.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.028
What is that?

04:46.120 --> 04:50.557
Well, everybody kneels
and you eat the Body of Christ.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.279
I cannot go that far.
I'm sorry.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.679
I have the highest respect,

04:54.760 --> 04:58.878
but my grandchild
is not going to eat Jesus.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.916
- I can give you Christmas.
- What about Easter?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.991
Easter?
She wants Easter, Seymour.

05:03.080 --> 05:05.719
- What about Catechism?
- No! Whatever that is.

05:05.800 --> 05:09.190
Now, both of you, we have to talk
about the bar mitzvah.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.918
Why can't we just let him decide?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.752
A child cannot decide.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.273
But I don't want a bar mitzvah.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.776
Then I don't think
we can reach an agreement.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.234
- Dad.
- She wants the child to decide?

05:18.320 --> 05:19.958
A child cannot decide.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.439
Then we won't have a child.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.318
We can marry,
but we won't have children.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.789
Miss Dwyer,
you are as pretty as a picture.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.555
I congratulate you
on how far you've come.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.671
Your parents must be proud.

05:31.760 --> 05:35.833
But I think we should just shake hands
and everybody go their own way.

05:35.920 --> 05:39.151
I'm not leaving.
I'm not going to go.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.800
And I'm not a picture,
Mr. Levov, I'm myself.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.348
I'm Mary Dawn Dwyer
and I love your son.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.873
I love him.
That's why I'm here.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.234
So, please...

05:52.120 --> 05:53.633
Let's go on.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.114
So, the old man
was won over.

06:02.240 --> 06:07.314
In a few years, the Swede took over
the glove factory, built it up.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.278
He commuted from the home
he and Dawn had made together

06:10.360 --> 06:12.396
30 miles west of Newark,

06:12.480 --> 06:16.473
out past the suburbs
in wealthy Old Rimrock,

06:16.560 --> 06:18.835
where they were raising
the child they had,

06:18.920 --> 06:20.512
a daughter, Merry.

06:20.600 --> 06:25.515
Count! Where are you?

06:26.320 --> 06:27.639
Count!

06:29.600 --> 06:31.636
I hear him.

06:31.720 --> 06:36.316
Count! We're here!
Count!

06:36.400 --> 06:37.879
Come on, Count.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.831
Penny, Russ,
how are you doing?

06:50.920 --> 06:53.216
- How's the family, Mr. Levov?
- Real good, thanks.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.913
- You two have a good rest of your day.
- You, too, Mr. Levov.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.233
Something was
smiling down on him.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.153
This is the way I thought
it would always be.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.468
Daddy!

07:18.560 --> 07:23.190
Life would open its arms
and he would carry all before him.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.033
He was the Swede,
after all.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.078
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:31.560 --> 07:35.348
♪ Won't you play the music
so the cradle can rock ♪

07:35.440 --> 07:40.560
♪ To a lullaby in ragtime ♪

07:40.640 --> 07:45.191
♪ Sleepy hands are creeping
to the end of the clock ♪

07:45.280 --> 07:47.874
♪ Play a lullaby in ragtime... ♪

07:47.960 --> 07:49.473
Jerry Levov.

07:51.320 --> 07:55.950
God, Nathan!
I didn't expect to see you here.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.157
Well, I didn't expect
to see you either...

07:59.240 --> 08:02.471
I was sure you'd find all this
sentimentality repellent.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.788
Yeah, I do.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.151
This nostalgia. Bullshit.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.312
- You wanna find a spot?
- Sure.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.072
So, why did you come?

08:15.480 --> 08:18.199
Well, of all the forms
of bullshit available,

08:18.280 --> 08:21.590
this was the most likely
to have unsettling surprises.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.672
And you like
unsettling surprises?

08:24.760 --> 08:26.512
...I suppose I do.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.871
Hey, did you see that display
they have for your brother?

08:34.240 --> 08:36.913
Like I said,
I'm not one for nostalgia.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.909
We were... I don't know,
we were probably ten,

08:42.039 --> 08:45.316
and we went to watch
one of his practices.

08:46.240 --> 08:50.552
He ran the ball and his teammates
took him down and they piled on.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.313
And we were worried
for a second, you and I.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.073
Worried about the Swede?
No, never.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.470
No, we were,
because they took him down hard.

08:59.600 --> 09:03.309
But he popped up
and dusted himself off.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.710
And as he trotted by,
he turned, uh...

09:06.800 --> 09:08.836
he turned to me,
his brother's friend.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.639
I mean, I was a nobody,
and he said...

09:11.720 --> 09:14.393
"Basketball was never like this, Skip."

09:15.680 --> 09:20.231
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
He called me Skip.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.672
My brother's dead.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.750
That's why I, uh, came up from Florida,
for his funeral.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.629
Not for this reunion thing.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.668
The... the Swede is...

09:37.760 --> 09:39.478
Just a sweetheart whose fate

09:39.560 --> 09:42.393
was to get himself fucked over
by some real crazies.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.835
My brother, the best you're
going to get in this country,

09:44.920 --> 09:46.717
got caught in a war
he didn't start.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.870
Jerry...

09:48.960 --> 09:52.748
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.958
No? You don't know?
Were you alive during the '60s?

09:57.040 --> 10:00.157
Well, I wasn't here.
I was... you know...

10:00.240 --> 10:03.073
I was out of country
for most of the '60s.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.114
Oh, I guess you're
the last person to hear, huh?

10:07.200 --> 10:10.590
The famous writer,
the last one to hear the big story.

10:16.720 --> 10:20.508
What is it, then,
th... this big story?

10:20.640 --> 10:23.438
Well, you know he and Dawn had a kid.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.279
You wrote to me
after she was born.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.750
Adorable when she was little.
So, she had a stutter, that was nothing.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.239
To hell with that.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.232
But then Merry got older
and when she did...

10:35.720 --> 10:38.553
I told him. I told him,
"Let her go.

10:38.640 --> 10:42.235
Otherwise, it will rot your gut
and take your life, too."

10:42.320 --> 10:44.834
But... he couldn't.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.555
And now I'm burying my brother.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.416
She was a good kid...

10:52.440 --> 10:55.079
Jerry was correct.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.674
Here I was,
the famous writer,

10:57.800 --> 11:00.872
the last one
to know the story.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.428
But now I wanted all of it.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.193
I wanted to hear what had become
of the young man

11:06.280 --> 11:09.113
from whom we had expected everything.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.272
Our hero.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.793
Our Kennedy.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.639
Grandpa.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.630
- Grandpa.
- Yes, Merry, what?

11:20.720 --> 11:25.111
Lady Jane's going to have
a calf, grandpa.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.519
I hope it's a heifer.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.433
What's a heifer, sweetheart?
You're talking to a guy from Newark.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.988
It's a girl, grandpa.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.433
Oh, a girl!

11:33.520 --> 11:36.353
I bet it's going to look just like Count.

11:36.440 --> 11:40.831
That's who mounted her.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.992
"Mounted"? Is that a way
for a young girl to talk?

11:44.080 --> 11:45.638
That's what it's called, Dad.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.040
Yeah, what's she supposed to say?

11:47.080 --> 11:48.752
"Make love"? It's a cow.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.910
And what does my son
need with cows?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.753
Why do they need to live this far
from civilization?

11:53.840 --> 11:57.799
No offense to the locals, Mr. Orcutt,
Mrs. Orcutt, but let's be candid.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.155
This is all rock-ribbed
Republican out here.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.430
- That's true. That's so.
- Lou, don't start.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.520
What did I say?

12:03.600 --> 12:06.160
We're out in the middle of nowhere.
This is Ku Klux Klan country.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.633
Dad, will you stop?

12:07.720 --> 12:10.792
I don't see why my brother wants
to live here either,

12:10.880 --> 12:13.075
but a couple of cows
doesn't make it Mississippi.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.594
- This is Morris County.
- Grandpa!

12:15.680 --> 12:17.193
Jerry's right, Dad.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.111
No one thinks
like you anymore.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.556
We can live where we want.
This is America.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.359
- Newark is in America.
- Grandpa!

12:25.440 --> 12:27.476
Yes, darling.
What? Yes, sweetheart.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.750
Come to the barn to see Count.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.956
Wait till you meet him.
He's so...

12:50.640 --> 12:51.993
I adore Merry.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.991
I think she's very special.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.513
- Thank you.
- We all do.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.352
She likes coming here.
She told us that.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.953
Very much.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.793
Sometimes when
she's here, I ask her,

13:01.880 --> 13:05.714
"Merry, what terrible thing
do you think would happen

13:05.800 --> 13:07.950
if you stopped stuttering?

13:08.040 --> 13:11.828
How do you think your father
or your mother would feel if you stopped?"

13:11.920 --> 13:13.638
But she can't stop.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.356
I think Merry's stuttering
is a strategy.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.199
A strategy for what?

13:21.320 --> 13:23.880
For avoiding competition
with the beautiful mother,

13:23.960 --> 13:27.236
the beautiful
Miss New Jersey mother,

13:27.320 --> 13:30.357
for winning the handsome father.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.078
This is about our looks?

13:32.160 --> 13:34.071
- Doctor...
- Sheila.

13:34.160 --> 13:38.073
Sheila, stuttering isn't
something that Merry chooses.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.673
It makes her suffer.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.832
Maybe the benefits
outweigh the suffering.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.639
But it's killing us to see her.
It's killing Merry's mother.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.671
Maybe that's one
of the benefits.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.117
Have you thought about how difficult
it must be for Merry

13:52.200 --> 13:55.715
growing up the daughter of someone
who's had so much attention

13:55.800 --> 13:58.439
for something as trivial as beauty?

13:58.520 --> 14:03.719
Maybe the reason Merry stutters
is to stop people from asking her,

14:03.800 --> 14:07.873
"Do you want to be Miss New Jersey
just like your Mommy?"

14:07.960 --> 14:10.269
But who asks her that?
Nobody asks her that.

14:10.360 --> 14:14.194
I'm not Miss New Jersey,
for God's sake. I'm her mother.

14:14.280 --> 14:19.229
It's just that in a highly-pressured
perfectionist family, you...

14:19.320 --> 14:21.356
Who says we're
a highly-perfectionist family?

14:21.440 --> 14:22.998
We're an ordinary family.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.390
What about the physiological basis
for her stuttering?

14:26.480 --> 14:28.118
I read an article where...

14:28.200 --> 14:30.919
I can give you organic theories
if that's what you want,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.788
but that's not the way I've found
I can be most effective.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.553
Ouch. Ouch.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.551
I told you
to wear your shoes.

14:44.640 --> 14:49.589
You didn't tell me
about how sharp the rocks would be.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.600
No!

14:51.680 --> 14:52.874
Dad!

14:58.040 --> 15:01.555
Do I look... look like
Audrey Hepburn?

15:03.880 --> 15:06.872
Better. You look like
Meredith Levov.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.399
Do you...

15:11.720 --> 15:15.599
- miss Mother?
- Sure I do.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.079
Me, too.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.230
She wanted to come.
She couldn't.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.833
I... I know.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.356
Lady Jane's going to have her calf
any day now. Mom had to be there.

15:25.440 --> 15:28.512
- Yes, Dad. I know.
- She'll come next time.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.835
Have you had a nice time here?

15:35.480 --> 15:36.754
With you?

15:38.400 --> 15:39.674
Terrible.

15:43.160 --> 15:48.757
♪ Two drifters
off to see the world ♪

15:48.840 --> 15:53.072
♪ There's such
a lot of world to see ♪

15:53.160 --> 15:58.188
♪ We're after the same
rainbow's end ♪

15:58.280 --> 16:00.874
♪ Waitin' around the bend ♪

16:00.960 --> 16:03.679
♪ My huckleberry friend ♪

16:03.760 --> 16:08.072
♪ Moon river and me ♪

16:26.760 --> 16:28.432
Hold these for your mother.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.398
Daddy...

16:37.520 --> 16:39.033
Kiss me.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.514
No.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.354
Really, really kiss me.

17:05.640 --> 17:09.428
Kiss me the way
you kiss mother.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.238
No!

17:12.680 --> 17:14.432
And fix your dress.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.952
Oh, I'm sorry, Cookie.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.951
Oh, I deserve it.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.952
It's the same at school
with my friends.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.474
I get started with
something and I go...

17:41.480 --> 17:45.314
...too far
and I get carried aw...

18:06.880 --> 18:08.840
There's nothing wrong
with that little girl.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.474
Her mind goes too fast
for her tongue. That's all.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.136
There, I just saved you the money
you were going to give to the shrink,

18:14.160 --> 18:17.232
- because that's all there is to it.
- We just want to help her, Dad.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.416
"Help"? That girl?
Just give her a little bit of time.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.069
Let her tongue catch up to that brain.
The rest will follow from that.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.037
Freddy, is something up
with this machine?

18:25.120 --> 18:26.519
Every now and then, she kicks.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.478
No, no, no. You'll be throwing stitches
soon. Send it down to the shop.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.959
See my son, Vick?

18:31.040 --> 18:33.713
He picks out the bad machine from 100.
He's got the ear.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.751
He gets it from you, Lou.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.274
How are you feeling, Dad?

18:45.440 --> 18:47.556
You don't have to come in every day.

18:47.640 --> 18:50.359
Who comes in every day?
I don't.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.438
Besides, where else am I supposed to go?

18:54.440 --> 18:56.670
- Time cards, gentlemen.
- Thank you, Vicky.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.355
Vicky, my son is trying to tell me never
to come around here anymore.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.591
I didn't say "anymore,"
I said "not every day."

19:03.680 --> 19:05.796
But, Lou, you built this place.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.236
You made a home for all of us.
Where else do you belong?

19:09.320 --> 19:11.311
Exactly my point.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.200
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.989
- You finish your stuttering book?
- Mm-hmm.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.514
Have you written down
all the words that stopped you today?

19:32.760 --> 19:35.228
D... do you want to check?

19:35.360 --> 19:37.157
Not if you say you finished.

19:37.280 --> 19:42.070
My teacher in school never believes me
unless she checks.

19:42.200 --> 19:45.795
Well, your teacher says that you have
a stubborn streak.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.918
Merry, why does she say that?

19:51.840 --> 19:55.037
Because of the homework.

19:56.040 --> 20:00.511
The class had to write an answer
to the question "Why are we here?"

20:00.600 --> 20:03.592
- and Merry wrote...
- Merry can tell me herself.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.039
Sorry.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.999
"Why are apes here?"

20:12.720 --> 20:13.755
That's it?

20:13.840 --> 20:15.114
She made her rewrite it.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.673
So I wrote...

20:18.680 --> 20:20.113
"Why are...

20:22.760 --> 20:24.318
kangaroos here?"

20:24.400 --> 20:27.153
And then last week,

20:27.240 --> 20:29.549
the teacher asked them,
"What is life?"

20:29.640 --> 20:31.790
This is what they ask in school?

20:31.880 --> 20:34.235
"What is life?"
What did you answer?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.592
I don't...

20:38.680 --> 20:41.877
- remember.
- Yes, you do.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.795
"Life is just a short space of time

20:47.880 --> 20:51.031
in which you were alive."

20:57.040 --> 20:58.473
Daddy,

20:58.560 --> 21:02.155
do you understand?

21:06.440 --> 21:07.839
Yes, I think I do.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.831
He assumed the lotus posture

21:09.920 --> 21:13.799
and another priest stepped forward
and poured gasoline over him.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.080
- A very frail, old man in his 70s,
- Oh, my God.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.390
- Quang Duc.
- What is this?

21:18.480 --> 21:21.790
This monk burned himself
and he sat there.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.440
- Oh, Merry shouldn't be seeing this.
- No.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.953
And then suddenly, a towering flame

21:26.040 --> 21:31.478
and the smell of gasoline and of burning
flesh in the air for ten minutes.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.832
And the priests and the nuns in the
audience moaned and prostrated them...

21:39.520 --> 21:41.556
Why did that poor...

21:41.640 --> 21:44.871
why did that poor man
have to burn himself?

21:46.640 --> 21:48.392
Hey.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.234
That gentle man and
those gentle people.

21:52.320 --> 21:55.312
It's far away, baby.
It's far away.

21:55.760 --> 21:59.548
- Doesn't anybody care?
- Of course people care.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.154
Doesn't anybody...

22:02.240 --> 22:05.915
doesn't anybody
have a conscience?

22:06.000 --> 22:09.788
- Yes, you have a conscience.
- Cookie.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.949
Don't cry. Shh.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.078
- Do they look good, Daddy?
- You've got the touch.

22:38.160 --> 22:40.037
If you don't end up senator
for New Jersey,

22:40.120 --> 22:42.588
you'll make a great short-order cook.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.797
I'd rather cook any day.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.435
Mmm. Great.

22:48.520 --> 22:52.115
This makes you the first Levov in history
who can prepare edible food.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.795
As long as it's hamburgers.

22:55.880 --> 22:59.111
What's wrong with hamburgers?
It's an American classic.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.998
I came here to speak to you about Vietnam.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.552
Talk about an American classic.

23:08.160 --> 23:12.358
There's an American classic asshole.

23:12.440 --> 23:17.309
We abhor the political murder
of any state by another.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.719
Fucking liar.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.336
He's better than the guy
he ran against.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.874
Barry Goldwater
would have buried us all.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.270
Fucking madman.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.432
Lyndon Baines

23:29.520 --> 23:32.671
"Baby Burner" Johnson.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.672
- What's going on?
- Johnson's press conference.

23:35.760 --> 23:39.230
We don't disagree, Mer.
We're all against the war in this family.

23:39.320 --> 23:41.675
You heartless, miserable prick.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.797
Merry, stop. Please.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.598
What do you care about the war?

23:46.680 --> 23:49.319
You're just contented,
middle-class people.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.719
Some people would be very happy

23:50.800 --> 23:52.836
to have contented,
middle-class people for parents.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.309
Well, I'm not brainwashed
enough to be one of them.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.753
Merry. Dawn.

23:56.840 --> 24:00.389
What? Don't tell me. Tell her.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.074
Tell her to behave
like a civilized person.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.628
- Don't tell me what to do.
- I'm your mother.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.676
I can and I will
tell you what to do.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.394
- I'm turning this off.
- Sure, turn it off.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.278
The Democratic Republic of Hanoi

24:13.360 --> 24:15.351
could hust burn down

24:15.440 --> 24:18.034
and Mom would hust go on
worrying about her cows.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.400
- Merry...
- Don't touch me, Dad.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.793
I can't stand this.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.553
You're not anti-war,
you're anti-everything.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.312
And you're pro...

24:27.600 --> 24:29.079
cow.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.393
I don't know why
she's turned against me.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.075
Is it her stuttering?

24:44.160 --> 24:46.549
Is she angry because
she can't make friends?

24:46.640 --> 24:49.393
She's made friends, all right?
The ones she's made in New York.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.670
Who is she?

24:55.680 --> 24:58.148
I thought she was smart.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.231
She's becoming stupid, Seymour.

25:00.320 --> 25:04.313
No. She's just a kid with a strong will,
a strong idea.

25:04.440 --> 25:07.637
- It's not very well worked out...
- You're defending her. She hates me.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.438
Dawn.

25:09.520 --> 25:13.149
She talks to me like...
I don't know what.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.080
With no respect.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.997
And if I ever spoke
to my mother like that,

25:19.120 --> 25:21.270
do you know what my father
would have done?

25:21.360 --> 25:24.238
He would have turned you
over his knee.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.958
You think it's funny?

25:30.320 --> 25:32.356
I have to pick her up
from the train.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.189
I can't believe we let her go to New York.

25:38.320 --> 25:41.392
She's 16, Seymour.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.473
We don't even know who she's with.
We don't know who her friends are.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.757
Well, she likes them, they like her.
That's what's important.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.149
I don't like those pamphlets
they give her.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.913
What pamphlets?

25:55.640 --> 25:57.471
In her room, Seymour.

26:38.480 --> 26:41.153
Police
and fire departments are on the alert

26:41.240 --> 26:43.834
as negro demonstrators
take to the streets of Newark

26:43.920 --> 26:47.879
after the arrest and alleged beating
of cab driver John W. Smith.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.030
You were supposed
to be on the 8:00 o'clock.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.516
You were involved in something there,
something political.

27:48.600 --> 27:53.037
Everything is political.
Brushing your teeth is political.

27:53.120 --> 27:56.874
People who are against the war.
Is that who you see?

27:56.960 --> 28:00.236
They're just people
who don't believe in the war.

28:00.320 --> 28:03.517
- I don't believe in the war myself.
- Then what's your problem?

28:03.600 --> 28:05.096
I don't want you getting mixed up
in things

28:05.120 --> 28:06.838
that could hurt your chances
for college.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.309
My friends have been to college.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.437
They had to leave because of the way
they treat student protestors.

28:12.520 --> 28:17.230
Is that who they are?
College kids who have gotten thrown out?

28:17.320 --> 28:20.915
They're just my friends.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.549
Can't you believe that I have friends?
Don't you believe that?

28:24.680 --> 28:26.591
Of course I believe you have friends.

28:26.680 --> 28:29.148
They wanted me to stay the night.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.753
No. That's...

28:30.840 --> 28:33.760
You can never even think about staying
over with people that we don't know

28:33.800 --> 28:36.394
or you'll never be
allowed to go again.

28:36.480 --> 28:39.995
What do you believe in,
Daddy?

28:40.080 --> 28:42.275
This is not about politics.

28:42.360 --> 28:45.875
My responsibility is to you,
not the war.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.712
Oh, I know.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.678
That's why I have to go to New York,

28:50.760 --> 28:53.274
because people there
do feel responsible,

28:53.360 --> 28:56.875
responsible for blowing up
Vietnamese villages,

28:56.960 --> 28:59.269
blowing up little babies.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.430
But you don't care.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.909
And neither does Mother.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.549
No one in our family
or in our fucking little town does.

29:07.680 --> 29:10.194
Sir, could you go
to your vehicle?

29:10.280 --> 29:12.874
You need to get off the street.
There's a curfew in effect.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.279
"Curfew"?

29:14.360 --> 29:17.511
- What kind of fascist bullshit is that?
- Merry!

29:17.600 --> 29:21.115
We've got enough trouble tonight.
The curfew's to protect people.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.679
From what?
They should riot.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.558
I'm sorry, officer.
We... we're both sorry.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.756
I am not fucking sorry.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.752
She's 16. You got any at home,
you'll understand.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.159
I don't.

29:34.360 --> 29:35.634
Right.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.376
Hundreds of protestors
have gathered in the Fourth Precinct

29:40.400 --> 29:43.039
where cab driver John W. Smith
is being held

29:43.120 --> 29:47.830
after allegedly being beaten by police,
who are calling this an isolated incident.

29:47.920 --> 29:51.390
Yet some local residents
are urging violent retaliation.

29:51.480 --> 29:56.190
More news as it comes in.
And now, back to our regular programming.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.593
Get on out of here!

30:09.680 --> 30:12.176
- Streets to the people.
- Power to the people!

30:12.200 --> 30:13.952
Get the fuck back home now!

30:14.080 --> 30:17.277
Black power! Black power! Black power!

30:17.760 --> 30:19.600
- Black power!
- Get out of here!

30:21.560 --> 30:23.073
Jesus, Merry!

30:34.120 --> 30:35.758
Your father called from Florida.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.536
He wants to know
if they've come near the factory.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.879
I'll see in the morning.

30:38.960 --> 30:42.191
You're not going to work tomorrow,
not with the riot going on.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.714
It's not a riot.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.517
It's a revolution.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.716
People standing up for their rights.

30:49.800 --> 30:52.016
If you're going to defend them,
maybe you should just join them.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.439
That's a good idea.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.670
The governor called
the National Guard in.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.591
Of course. I mean,
what else can he do?

30:57.680 --> 31:02.879
He can treat black people
like human beings, that's what.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.997
No blacks on the city council,
the poverty, the unemployment.

31:06.080 --> 31:09.231
We have 80% negroes working at the plant.
We're proud of that.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.436
Oh, I forgot.

31:12.440 --> 31:13.919
You're a hero.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.073
- Hello?
- Seymour.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.519
- Vicky.
- It's bad.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.600
What is it?

31:33.960 --> 31:36.190
I ain't never seen anything this bad.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.509
They're beating 'em and dragging...
Oh, my God.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.192
Sniper!

31:51.720 --> 31:53.950
- Vicky.
- People are shooting.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.156
Police are shooting,
and soldiers.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.710
People have lost their minds.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.839
Thank you.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.559
Thank you, sir.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.438
- Going to war, huh?
- It's what it is.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.954
No. It isn't, either.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.429
These are just troublemakers,
so think.

32:33.520 --> 32:36.637
What we're saying is,
you're here to keep the peace, son.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.632
That means protecting the people
and the property of this neighborhood.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.756
What I'm saying is to think.

32:41.840 --> 32:45.150
Think before you start shooting
at somebody's window.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.276
- Vicky.
- These aren't snipers.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.518
These are people,
good people who live around here,

32:51.600 --> 32:54.034
people just like your own mothers
and fathers.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.350
That's who lives up there.

32:56.440 --> 32:58.874
Now, this is their home.

32:58.960 --> 33:02.919
And they've got to live here
long after you're gone.

33:03.040 --> 33:07.909
This is their home.
Not yours.

33:16.560 --> 33:17.993
All right. Well done.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.776
I'm just telling them how it is,
that's all.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.872
But tonight is going to be bad.
Do you hear me?

33:22.960 --> 33:25.554
So, go home. Take everybody
who came to work and go home.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.039
You're staying, though.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.920
There ain't no telling
how bad it's going get.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.639
Won't be safe for anybody,
and not you.

33:31.720 --> 33:34.075
The place will be safer
with someone inside.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.957
Then I'll stay, too.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.096
- I've got that.
- No, I'll put it.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.792
- Vicky.
- They're shootin' outside...

33:57.880 --> 33:59.279
I got it.

34:03.400 --> 34:06.278
Are you talking to me?

34:06.360 --> 34:10.353
I told you not to move!
Keep your people back!

35:20.680 --> 35:22.159
What do you want?

35:23.320 --> 35:24.912
Turn it down.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.191
All dressed up for your stupid...

35:35.760 --> 35:37.591
...award that they gave you?

35:40.280 --> 35:42.316
You expect me to...

35:43.800 --> 35:45.472
congratulate you, too?

35:48.360 --> 35:50.271
What was the award
for anyway?

35:50.360 --> 35:52.794
We didn't shut down
after the riots.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.136
The people who worked there,
who have always worked there,

35:55.160 --> 35:56.878
were welcomed back
to their jobs.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.473
The mayor thought that
that was good,

35:58.560 --> 36:00.376
that other businesses
should have done the same.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.550
There was a ceremony in his office.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.318
Congratulations...

36:12.480 --> 36:16.632
Swede.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.711
And I would have liked it
if you had come.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.119
I would have...

36:22.480 --> 36:24.072
fucking hated it.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.835
Have you thought about
what I asked you?

36:31.640 --> 36:33.358
Going away to private school?

36:33.440 --> 36:35.237
If you don't like
living here with us.

36:35.320 --> 36:39.836
I just want to be able to go to New York
again on the weekends.

36:39.920 --> 36:43.754
No. You didn't come home last time.
You knew the rules.

36:43.840 --> 36:48.118
I never thought my own father
would keep me prisoner.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.077
Merry.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.792
I have an idea for you.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.476
I've been thinking
and I have an idea.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.550
You want to protest the war.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.154
Protest it right here in Old Rimrock.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.515
What am I going to do,
march around the post office?

37:12.600 --> 37:15.114
"Bring the war home."
Isn't that the slogan?

37:15.200 --> 37:17.760
Look, they gave me this award.

37:17.880 --> 37:19.871
It's hust a stupid plaque,
but it means one thing.

37:19.960 --> 37:23.111
If you take a stand, people notice.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.954
If you oppose the war right here
with all your strength...

37:28.040 --> 37:30.349
This is part of America too, you know.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.668
Read Marx.

37:33.760 --> 37:37.469
Revolutions don't begin
in the countryside.

37:37.560 --> 37:41.394
- We're not talking about revolution.
- You're not talking about revolution.

37:46.720 --> 37:49.029
You think about what I'm saying.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.439
I'm sure she's just with her friends
in New York.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.431
Should we call the police?

39:05.520 --> 39:07.909
No, let's give her some more time.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.628
Swede...

39:14.480 --> 39:15.959
do you think...

39:17.440 --> 39:19.112
the post office...

39:20.600 --> 39:22.397
- Do you think Merry...
- No.

39:22.480 --> 39:25.233
It's not possible.

39:25.320 --> 39:28.153
You told her to bring the war home.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.231
Well, that was just talk.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.519
I hope so.

39:55.200 --> 39:57.350
A warrant. How many lies
did you tell to get that?

39:57.440 --> 40:00.456
We have an informant that confirms that
your daughter and another young woman

40:00.480 --> 40:02.152
placed a bomb in the post office.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.912
An informant?
Who is this informant?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.976
Does your daughter know Russ Hamlin,
the storekeeper?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.399
We all know Russ, Penny.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.833
Do you know Russ Hamlin is dead?

40:08.920 --> 40:10.440
I know it because it was on the radio.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.909
- It has nothing to do with...
- Hey, hey, hey.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.519
Open that up.

40:35.280 --> 40:37.430
What does my daughter
know about dynamite?

40:37.520 --> 40:39.636
- Mrs. Levov.
- This is a girl.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.631
This is a high school girl.

40:41.720 --> 40:44.837
She didn't make a bomb.
She doesn't even know what a bomb is.

40:44.960 --> 40:49.317
How could you even think that she could
make a bomb or... or kill somebody?

40:49.400 --> 40:53.234
- Where is she, Mrs. Levov?
- I don't know.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.477
- She's been tricked.
- Mm-hmm.

40:56.560 --> 40:57.834
She's been tricked!

40:58.840 --> 41:02.469
Why does everybody say that she did it
when she couldn't have done it?

41:02.560 --> 41:05.472
She's been tricked
and abducted.

41:05.560 --> 41:07.630
Somebody is brainwashing her
right now.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.296
- We need to find her, Mrs...
- She doesn't have anything to do with it!

41:10.320 --> 41:12.456
My daughter could not have had
anything to do with this!

41:12.480 --> 41:13.595
Then why did she run off?

41:13.680 --> 41:15.336
Maybe she doesn't even know
you're looking for her.

41:15.360 --> 41:18.040
You know that they've probably taken her
underground already, right?

41:18.160 --> 41:19.976
- Seymour.
- It's all right, Dawnie. Who's "they"?

41:20.000 --> 41:23.037
You said she has political friends
in New York.

41:23.120 --> 41:25.998
"We are against everything
decent in America.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.150
We will loot and burn"
and on and on and on.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.536
All right, that's written on a wall.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.216
That's probably written
on a lot of kids' walls.

41:31.240 --> 41:34.835
Not in Old Rimrock it's not.
Not in...

41:34.920 --> 41:37.514
"our fucking little town."

41:37.640 --> 41:38.936
What is that?
What are you reading?

41:38.960 --> 41:41.599
- Your daughter stutters?
- Oh, my God.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.557
What does that have
to do with anything?

41:43.640 --> 41:46.313
A police officer in Newark
made a note about it two months ago.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.829
- You were present, sir.
- Oh, for Christ's sake. That?

41:48.920 --> 41:53.277
Yeah, that. That and a couple questions
raised by her teachers.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.918
Come on. Swede!

41:55.000 --> 41:57.833
We're the family,
that's who we are.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.036
They have a right to be here.
They're my family.

42:00.160 --> 42:01.388
- Seymour.
- Mom.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.074
- Our beautiful little girl.
- I know. Dad.

42:04.160 --> 42:07.197
How could this be? Would you tell me
how this thing could be?

42:07.280 --> 42:08.554
Lou?

42:12.720 --> 42:14.676
Make them stop.

42:14.800 --> 42:18.475
They keep saying that Merry did this.
Make them stop saying it.

42:18.560 --> 42:21.996
- Not Merry. Nobody knows if she did it.
- That's right. Nobody knows.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.071
Let them talk.
You're the mother.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.479
She's hust a little girl.

42:25.560 --> 42:27.596
Maybe not so little anymore.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.875
- Tell them, Lou.
- I will. I will.

42:29.960 --> 42:32.474
It'll be all right.
It's going to be fine.

42:39.640 --> 42:44.760
- You going to be all right?
- We said we'd do this.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.313
Let's do it.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.393
Penny...

42:56.600 --> 42:59.194
We got the news
like everyone else, like you.

43:00.880 --> 43:02.950
We're sorry.

43:03.040 --> 43:06.396
Dawn and I, we're sorry for you,

43:06.520 --> 43:08.795
your son, your children,

43:08.880 --> 43:12.395
sorry for this t... terrible thing,
this terrible, awful...

43:16.840 --> 43:19.229
Whatever happened...

43:19.320 --> 43:23.757
whatever Merry did or did not do,
all I'm saying is, I blame myself.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.353
Mrs. Hamlin...

43:28.840 --> 43:30.512
Penny.

43:30.600 --> 43:33.398
I don't know if you can understand,
b... because Merry...

43:36.520 --> 43:38.590
Well...

43:38.720 --> 43:40.676
This is hard to say,
but if Merry did this,

43:40.760 --> 43:43.638
and I understand that's the way it seems,
then it's myself I blame.

43:43.720 --> 43:46.598
Because I did
what I thought is right.

43:46.680 --> 43:49.911
I... I raised her the way I thought best.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.515
I mean, you're a parent, Penny.

43:53.600 --> 43:55.670
My God, you know how hard it is!

43:55.760 --> 44:01.676
And then, things come up with kids,
from inside them, someplace inside.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.112
How can you know what to do?

44:06.120 --> 44:09.749
You try.
You love them.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.751
And I still love my daughter ri...

44:13.560 --> 44:15.391
Maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but...

44:17.160 --> 44:18.639
I love her right now more than ever.

44:18.760 --> 44:22.514
- I hurt for her more now...
- I don't blame you...

44:23.520 --> 44:24.919
Mr. Levov.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.389
I don't blame either one of you.

44:30.400 --> 44:34.154
You didn't go out and buy the dynamite
and make the bomb.

44:34.240 --> 44:35.912
You didn't plant the bomb.

44:37.680 --> 44:39.796
I feel badly for you both.

44:42.640 --> 44:48.590
The two of you are as much victims
of this tragedy as we are.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.991
I lost a husband.

44:56.160 --> 44:59.391
My kids lost a father.

44:59.480 --> 45:02.472
But the difference is that, for us...

45:04.320 --> 45:08.108
we will survive as a family,

45:08.200 --> 45:10.395
a loving family.

45:10.520 --> 45:14.718
We will survive
with our memories intact...

45:16.080 --> 45:19.595
and our memories to sustain us.

45:19.680 --> 45:23.798
We are the same family we were
when Russ was here.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.791
And we will survive.

45:30.920 --> 45:32.751
That's the difference.

45:41.880 --> 45:43.656
Police have widened their search

45:43.680 --> 45:45.796
for the missing teenager,
Meredith Levov,

45:45.880 --> 45:48.519
for her involvement in the bombing
of a post office.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.518
Where is she?

46:00.880 --> 46:02.108
Swede.

46:04.560 --> 46:05.788
Dawnie.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.875
I want her
to come home now.

46:14.040 --> 46:15.393
Right now.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.074
Now.

46:19.080 --> 46:20.752
Now.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.677
- Now. Now.
- Precious.

46:23.680 --> 46:24.954
Now.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.797
There were three blasts.

47:07.880 --> 47:10.760
The townhouse is totally destroyed.
If there was anybody else in there...

47:10.800 --> 47:13.136
But the two women who escaped,
they're young, they're white.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.435
- "Is one of them Merry?"
- Why not? Why couldn't it be?

47:15.560 --> 47:17.278
Mr. Levov, it's been over a year.

47:17.360 --> 47:19.954
Look, the bombs they were building
in the townhouse,

47:20.040 --> 47:21.416
they were pipes filled with dynamite.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.749
Well, the bomb that blew up Hamlins,
that's what it was.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.558
It was a pipe
filled with dynamite.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.995
One of the missing women,
we know who she is.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.559
Her parents own the building.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.437
They're down in the Caribbean
growing a tan

47:31.520 --> 47:34.432
while their rich-fuck daughter's making
bombs to blow people up with.

47:34.520 --> 47:37.717
But the other girl, you don't know
the identity of the other girl.

47:37.800 --> 47:39.119
And therefore it's Merry?

47:41.760 --> 47:43.239
Go home, Mr. Levov.

47:43.320 --> 47:45.072
This is my daughter.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.878
We'll tell you.
All right, Mr. Levov?

47:46.960 --> 47:48.736
No, you won't.
You're not telling us anything.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.149
And for Christ's sake,
stop tapping our phone.

47:54.440 --> 47:56.908
There's... there's nothing.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.912
All right? There's one thing.
It was nothing.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.353
What?

48:03.000 --> 48:05.798
Someone said they saw her
at the train station.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.916
- Here in Newark?
- It didn't make any sense.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.116
We thought she'd be
halfway across the country.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.913
We worked it.
It went nowhere.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.797
This was months ago.

48:14.880 --> 48:18.236
Main line going
to Pittsburgh arriving from New York,

48:18.320 --> 48:21.153
the 5:30 Express on track two,

48:21.240 --> 48:24.232
5:30 Express from New York
arriving on track two.

49:24.760 --> 49:26.318
"Rita Cohen."

49:26.440 --> 49:28.510
From the Wharton School of Business.

49:28.600 --> 49:31.831
I'm doing my thesis on the leather glove
industry here in Newark.

49:31.920 --> 49:34.115
I'd be grateful for anything
you could teach me.

49:34.520 --> 49:35.748
Mm-hmm.

49:40.160 --> 49:41.639
Go ahead, feel it.

49:43.720 --> 49:44.994
It's sheepskin.

49:45.080 --> 49:46.798
Cabretta.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.358
It's lovely.

49:49.440 --> 49:53.115
They've been shipped from the same ports
in Africa for hundreds of years.

49:56.880 --> 50:00.873
You want to learn about gloves?
We'll make you up a pair.

50:00.960 --> 50:02.552
Here? Now?

50:02.640 --> 50:04.073
Here.

50:04.160 --> 50:06.720
I'm guessing you're a four.

50:06.800 --> 50:08.916
Let me see what kind of guesser I am.

50:11.080 --> 50:13.719
Four it is.
That's as small as ladies' come.

50:13.800 --> 50:15.153
Any smaller is a child's.

50:15.280 --> 50:19.159
Harry, make up a four
for this young lady, British tan.

50:23.240 --> 50:25.754
You're witnessing a dying business,
Miss Cohen.

50:25.840 --> 50:31.710
- Am I? I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
- Oh, not us. Knock wood.

50:31.840 --> 50:35.071
No, we've still got the big accounts,
Bendel's, Macy's.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.479
No, I meant the whole industry.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.790
Everyone's moving to Hong Kong,
Puerto Rico.

50:38.880 --> 50:40.279
To cut labor costs.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.396
Exactly. Precisely.

50:42.480 --> 50:44.789
Everybody's hurting.

50:44.880 --> 50:47.678
It used to be that a woman owned ten,
12 pairs of gloves.

50:47.760 --> 50:49.079
Imagine that.

50:53.680 --> 50:55.636
These are for you, Miss.

51:03.360 --> 51:07.194
Slowly.
Always slowly the first time.

51:10.040 --> 51:12.554
Feel how it expands
when you make a fist.

51:18.080 --> 51:19.308
Thank you.

51:28.520 --> 51:31.034
She wants
her Audrey Hepburn scrapbook.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.270
- Talk to me.
- Not near the house.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.351
Swede, what is it?

51:43.640 --> 51:45.870
Somebody came to me from Merry.

51:47.080 --> 51:49.469
She's all right?
Where is she?

51:49.560 --> 51:51.800
I don't know. I don't know where she is,
but this person,

51:51.840 --> 51:53.910
this little person,
she looked younger than Merry.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.479
She wants
to meet me tomorrow.

51:55.560 --> 51:57.551
- Merry?
- No, this Rita person.

51:57.640 --> 52:00.552
She wants me to meet her
in a parking lot downtown.

52:00.640 --> 52:02.119
She gave me all these instructions.

52:02.200 --> 52:04.096
"Drive through the park.
Make sure you're not followed."

52:04.120 --> 52:07.112
The agents.
Are you going to tell the agents?

52:07.200 --> 52:10.636
I don't know.
I don't know what to do, Dawn.

52:11.760 --> 52:14.149
She knew about
the Audrey Hepburn pictures.

52:14.240 --> 52:17.835
She knew about the stuttering books,
the ballet classes, the cows.

52:17.920 --> 52:20.593
This girl, she could lead us to Merry.

52:23.280 --> 52:24.508
Where are the cows?

52:27.440 --> 52:29.590
- What?
- The cows, where are they?

52:30.640 --> 52:34.030
I sold them.
I'm selling them.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.031
Why would you sell your cows?

52:37.320 --> 52:42.235
You can't tell the agents... Swede.

52:42.320 --> 52:46.108
This girl,
just do whatever she says.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.428
Please.

54:06.880 --> 54:09.440
Why are you wearing Merry's coat?

54:09.520 --> 54:11.192
She gave it to me.

54:16.760 --> 54:18.273
Surely, you can...

54:20.280 --> 54:22.669
Surely, you can now tell me something
about Merry.

54:23.720 --> 54:26.439
- I surely cannot.
- I would like to speak with her.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.875
Well, she wouldn't like to speak with you.

54:28.960 --> 54:31.155
She hates you.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.912
Does she?

54:33.040 --> 54:34.712
Thinks you ought to be shot.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.358
Yes? That, too?

54:48.400 --> 54:50.072
Swede Levov.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.998
How much do you pay the workers
in your factory in Puerto Rico?

54:55.080 --> 54:57.640
I don't have a factory in Puerto Rico.
I stayed right here.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.836
How much do you pay
the women going blind

54:59.920 --> 55:02.957
stitching gloves for the ladies
at Bendel's and Macy's?

55:03.040 --> 55:05.315
You've seen how unhappy
my employees are.

55:05.400 --> 55:07.311
That's why they've worked for me
for 40 years,

55:07.400 --> 55:08.879
because they're so exploited.

55:08.960 --> 55:11.520
Who are you? You don't even know
what you're talking about.

55:11.600 --> 55:14.194
You own your people.
You own them, you use them,

55:14.280 --> 55:16.016
you sleep with them,
and then when you're done...

55:16.040 --> 55:19.271
Please, Rita. I haven't two minutes'
interest in your clichés.

55:19.360 --> 55:21.316
I want you to tell me
where my daughter is.

55:21.400 --> 55:23.576
- That's all I want to hear from you.
- Your daughter never wants

55:23.600 --> 55:25.238
to see you again.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.192
Or that mother.

55:28.280 --> 55:30.077
You don't know anything
about her mother.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.516
Lady Dawn?
Lady Dawn of the manor?

55:33.640 --> 55:37.155
I know all there is to know
about Lady fucking Dawn.

55:37.240 --> 55:39.151
So ashamed of her class origins,

55:39.240 --> 55:41.117
she had to become lady
of the fucking manor

55:41.200 --> 55:43.077
and turn her daughter
into a debutante.

55:43.160 --> 55:47.358
"A debutante"? Merry shoveled cow shit
since the age of six.

55:47.440 --> 55:50.716
- She rode tractors, she's 4-H.
- Fake. All fake.

55:50.800 --> 55:54.315
The daughter of the beauty queen
and the captain of the football team?

55:54.400 --> 55:56.675
What kind of nightmare
is that for a girl with a soul?

55:56.760 --> 55:59.638
Dawn is not a beauty queen.
She works a farm all day.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.598
Fake, fake. She works a farm
like a fucking upper-class landowner.

56:02.680 --> 56:04.875
"Upper class"?
Her father was a plumber!

56:04.960 --> 56:07.713
Her grandfather was
an lrish milk farmer!

56:07.840 --> 56:11.276
This is crazy!
Where's my daughter?

56:11.360 --> 56:15.353
Somebody is dead.
My daughter is accused of murder!

56:15.440 --> 56:18.079
You're really hung up
on that, aren't you?

56:18.160 --> 56:21.914
Do you know how many Vietnamese have
died in the time we've been talking here?

56:22.000 --> 56:23.558
You give her back to me!

56:23.640 --> 56:25.915
She's not a possession.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.070
You don't own her anymore,

56:28.160 --> 56:31.914
the way you own your factory
and your Buick fucking Electra.

56:34.080 --> 56:36.116
Where is she, Miss Cohen?

56:41.040 --> 56:43.110
So, where is she?

56:43.200 --> 56:45.714
The girl's our link,
our only one.

56:45.800 --> 56:48.678
You let her go? Why?
Why did you let her go?

56:48.800 --> 56:52.270
Well, she's just a kid. I know I can work
around her to get to Merry.

56:52.360 --> 56:53.793
That's nonsense.
That's crazy.

56:53.880 --> 56:55.776
You go to the cops.
You go to... what's it, the FBI.

56:55.800 --> 56:57.392
- You tell them everything.
- No. No.

56:57.480 --> 57:00.278
No? Did you get the infant's
phone number, at least?

57:00.360 --> 57:02.794
That's not the plan.
She makes contact with me.

57:02.880 --> 57:06.793
If she feels like it.
If she feels like it. You've got nothing.

57:06.880 --> 57:09.030
- Dr. Levov?
- What? I don't need you.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.360
- But, doctor...
- Just go hump in a lake, nurse, please.

57:15.320 --> 57:16.912
I've got to do this, Jerry.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.638
You should see Dawn these days.

57:18.720 --> 57:21.029
I'm worried about Dawn.
This has to work.

57:21.120 --> 57:24.590
Rita has to take us to Merry.
This Rita and the others.

57:24.680 --> 57:26.033
What others?

57:26.120 --> 57:28.759
The ones that have her.
They're controlling her.

57:28.880 --> 57:31.599
If she did this,
if she blew up Hamlins

57:31.680 --> 57:34.194
then these are the people
that made her do it. Don't you see?

57:34.280 --> 57:37.795
"If"? If she blew up Hamlins?
That's what you're asking yourself?

57:37.880 --> 57:39.677
What kind of man are you?

57:39.760 --> 57:41.751
You go to the FBI.
Do you hear me?

57:41.840 --> 57:43.114
No.

57:44.080 --> 57:46.230
And you can't tell
anyone what I told you.

57:47.760 --> 57:49.079
Promise me.

57:50.920 --> 57:52.148
All right.

58:27.160 --> 58:28.718
Good morning, boy.

59:25.040 --> 59:26.519
Do come in.

59:28.600 --> 59:30.272
Make yourself at home.

59:34.480 --> 59:38.473
I brought the money,
Miss Cohen.

59:38.560 --> 59:42.155
I brought the $10,000 in small bills.
Now, where's my daughter?

59:42.720 --> 59:47.510
Come off it, Swede.
You came here to fuck me.

59:48.960 --> 59:50.188
What?

59:52.760 --> 59:56.548
Please, Miss, if you have any feeling
for what everyone is going through...

59:56.640 --> 59:58.392
Ask anybody.

59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.072
Why does
a middle-aged capitalist

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.634
come to a hotel room
to meet a young piece of ass?

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.192
Say it.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:10.068
Just say it, Swede.
"I came here to fuck you."

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.388
Will you stop all this?

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.708
I'm 22.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.513
I do everything.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.999
I do it all.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.517
You're not scared,
are you?

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.871
A big guy like you can't have met
your match in little me.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.108
Pillar.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.396
Pillar of the fucking community,
Swede Levov.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.913
Come on, let's see the pillar.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.709
- What is the aim of all this?
- To introduce you to reality.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.473
And it ain't going to be no picnic,
jock-o.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.352
I'll tell you where your daughter is.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.396
First we fuck,

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.632
and then I'll zip up your little fly
and take you to where she is.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.109
My daughter has no part in this.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.192
You're not fit to wipe
my daughter's shoes.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.078
She has nothing to do with you
or the bombing.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.594
There.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.238
Put it right there.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.316
Do you know what size it is?

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.870
Let's see what kind of guesser you are.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.878
I'm guessing it's a four.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.118
In ladies', that's as small as they come.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.196
Stick it in.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.193
But slowly,
always slowly the first time.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.395
This has nothing to do with anything.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.034
You great, big Boy Scout.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.837
Do you want to know what this has to do
with what's happening?

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.033
Taste it.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.551
Taste it and you'll know.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.197
Do you want to know
how it tastes?

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.392
It tastes like your daughter.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.232
Get out of the street, clown!

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.157
What the fuck are you doing?

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.991
When you add it up,
your daughter's a minor,

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.036
she's seen a psychologist for years.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.076
That's evidence of mental stress.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.436
That bomb, she plainly
had no intent to kill,

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.636
not at that hour in the morning.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.314
Protecting her from us
is not intelligent.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.789
It's pretty unintelligent,
if you think about it.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.838
- What is it you want from me?
- Nothing.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.274
The description that you gave
of this girl, Rita Cohen,

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.875
if that's her real name, that's fine,
all right? You can go.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.030
Mrs. Levov know
what happened here today?

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.032
Yeah, I hust called her.
She's disappointed, naturally.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.315
This was our only hope.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.550
You should have called us in
on this, Mr. Levov.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.036
You've done everything wrong
you possibly could've.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.633
Since when?

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.154
Excuse me?

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.834
I've done everything wrong
since when?

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:54.193
That's a question you're gonna have
to answer for yourself, Mr. Levov.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.668
Seymour.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.176
- How long ago did she get here?
- I don't know. I didn't see her come in.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:15.317
She won't let me near her, poor thing,
and I didn't want to scare her.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.072
Excuse me.

All right. Stop it.
Stop, stop, stop.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.400
All right.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.594
Don't.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.959
I'm afraid.

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.918
I'm frightened.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.477
I'm frightened.
I'm frightened all the time.

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.435
It's not time
for your medicine.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.034
Dawn. Dawn.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.999
Think of the most pleasant place
you've ever been. Hmm?

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.591
Um...

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:42.431
At the... at the shore, in Avon.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.190
It's my uncle's house and...

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.353
I'm a girl.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.634
Come on, lie down.
Come on.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.954
And the...

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.311
the lifeguards are all...

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.591
Catholic boys from Fordham
and Holy Cross.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.796
They'd come down for summer.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.836
And they were all in love with you.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.110
I should have married one of them.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.753
- See you again tomorrow, Mr. Levov.
- Good night.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.789
At one minute before 1:00 this morning,

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.917
the switchboard at the U. S. Capitol
received a phone call.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.595
A man's voice said a bomb would go off
in the building in half an hour.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:00.037
At 1:30 in the morning, it did,
in a small, unmarked restroom

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.076
on the ground floor of the Senate side,

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.152
next to a barbershop
and near several small offices,

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.629
including one
committee hearing room.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.633
For a report on the first serious damage
to the nation's foremost structure

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.154
since the British burned it in 1814,

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.791
here is congressional correspondent
Lawrence Lawson.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.920
There was alarm for a time
that other bombs

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.394
might still be hidden
inside the Capitol.

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:26.438
They're forced to be outlaws
by the way this society is run

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.033
and we think they're great.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.416
Across the nation,

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.352
between January of last year
and April of this year,

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:36.991
a total of 4,330 bombings
have been reported.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.416
We 're going
to remake this country in the streets.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:42.238
We've got to build a strong base
and someday we've got to knock

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:45.595
those motherfuckers who control
this thing right on their ass.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:08:59.707
Seymour.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.234
Yeah?

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.473
The first time I was in Princeton,
I was at the Governor's mansion.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.515
That's right,
just after the contest.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:18.988
Twenty-one, scared to death.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.310
And his chauffeur drove me
from Elizabeth in my crown.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.430
I danced in my crown
with the governor of New Jersey...

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:36.667
and I ended up here. How?

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.432
How did I end up here?

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:46.707
You.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.834
You.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.996
You wouldn't leave me alone.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.478
Had to marry me.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.835
I just wanted to teach music.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.031
That's what I wanted.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.833
To teach kids music
in the school system...

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.909
and be left alone by boys.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.919
That's it.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.791
I never wanted to be
Miss Union County...

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.359
Miss crazy New Jersey...

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.238
Miss America.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.316
I wanted a scholarship.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.358
I wanted a degree... a hob.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.637
But then you arrived.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.917
You. Those hands.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.039
You wouldn't let me breathe!

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:08.355
Every time I looked up,
there's my boyfriend,

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.637
gaga because I was some
ridiculous beauty queen.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.117
You were like a child.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.116
And you made me a princess.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.392
Look where I wound up.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.592
In a madhouse.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.312
Your princess.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.518
In a madhouse.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.874
Thank you very much.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.598
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.678
She read a magazine article
about a doctor in Geneva.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.911
- What kind of doctor?
- A plastic surgeon.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.719
That's all she's talked about
since she came home.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.153
I see her looking in the mirror.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.708
She thinks somehow
that by having a facelift,

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.392
even though she's only 43...

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.950
She thinks that it will help her
to start over, and why not?

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.837
Imagine all that Dawn's been through.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.672
I don't have to imagine.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.438
I've seen this before. Women in trauma,
women who have been ill,

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.875
it can help them
to become a new woman.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.355
But I want the old Dawn.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.273
I want my wife
and I want Merry.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.510
We're not talking about Merry.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.194
But as for Dawn,

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.115
what if you were to go along with her,
support her in this,

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.749
in the trip to Switzerland,
the operation?

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.673
It could help the both of you
to put the past behind you.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.433
I don't want
to put the past behind.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.512
The past is Merry. There's no way I want
to put that behind.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.432
But Dawn does.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.599
What is it?
Can you help me out?

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.954
Lou, keep your voice down.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.598
This is the way
your friend paints?

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.856
You know it is, Dad. You've seen the one
in our living room.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.314
The one you paid
an arm and a leg for.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.275
I don't care what you say,
she looks like a million dollars.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.157
Yeah, all right, Dad.
She looks great.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.708
"Great"?
The girl's herself again.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.268
Getting rid of those cows
was the smartest thing she ever did.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.078
I never liked 'em.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:51.119
But getting that facelift?
I was against it, but I was wrong.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:57.352
- Darling, a million dollars.
- Thank you, Lou.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.715
I'm serious, Dawn.
The best money ever spent.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.313
You seem better.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.994
Lou, Sylvia, you know
Bill and Jesse Orcutt.

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.880
You'll see them at our house
for the barbecue.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.313
I hear you're the artist.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.278
And Bill is helping us on the design
for our new house.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.793
An artist and an architect.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.393
Architect's my day hob.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.755
Can't make a living just
being an abstract painter.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.239
No, I should think not.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:21.916
A glove, everybody understands.
These, you might be the only one.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.313
- I think they're divine, Bill.
- Thanks, Dawn.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.913
Still, I've got to hand it to anybody

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.992
who's got the guts to wear
that shirt and those pants.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.998
What? What did I say?

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.640
- Lou. Every time.
- What?

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:46.115
Well, I for one had enough
pretentious art talk for one night.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.998
But you enjoyed yourself.
You had a good time.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.353
All right, I did.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.110
I'm glad you're
doing so well, Dawn.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.039
I am doing well, aren't I?

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.078
I haven't seen you
this happy in a long time.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.354
Thank you, dear.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.391
- You drive them home.
- What do you mean?

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.118
- You drive them home.
- Seymour.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.200
Don't argue.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.359
I want my daughter.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.280
If you turn me in, she'll die.
She'll have no one.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.079
- What? What are you talking about?
- Stop.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.916
All right, all right. If you let me go,
I'll tell you where she is.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.116
You take me. Where is she?
Is she here?

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.316
- You take me there.
- No. I don't want to see her.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.597
- What?
- I can't take it anymore.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.752
You can't take it?
You can't take it?!

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.637
Wait a minute.
She's in Newark?

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.159
That's the building.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.909
Get out of the van.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.070
- Out.
- All right. All right.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.800
There's a dog and cat hospital
on the second floor.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.068
She's got a job there.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.912
But don't go in. Wait for her.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.276
If you go in, you'll make a scene.
She'll be discovered.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.750
She couldn't handle that.
She'd never survive the FBI.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.030
Take care of her, Mr. Levov.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.876
Daddy?

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.918
I'm lonesome.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.434
Where do you even
get a word like that?

01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.957
I like it when you hold me.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.632
Then I'll never let you go.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.154
Ever?

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.753
Not ever.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.308
Merry?

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.514
Daddy.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:29.310
- You're not stuttering.
- No, I'm not.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.636
I've become a Jain, Daddy.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.233
A "Jain"?

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.515
We're a small lndian sect.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.513
I wear the veil to do no harm
to the organisms that dwell in the air.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:44.994
Merry, this is awful.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.435
Do you walk this way every night?

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.751
Nor do we bathe,
to do no harm to the water.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.549
We step carefully for fear of crushing
some living obhect.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:00.036
There are souls imprisoned
in even the lowest form of life.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.871
Forgive me, Merry, but...

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.517
How can you stand this?

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.232
It's okay, Daddy.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.032
Really, I'm okay.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.514
You always had things over your bed.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.795
Used to be pictures
of Audrey Hepburn.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.831
Those are the five vows.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.600
"I renounce all killing of living beings,

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:49.309
whether subtle or gross,
moveable or immovable."

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.836
"I renounce all vices of lying
speech arising from anger.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.390
I renounce all sexual pleasure
with either Gods or men,

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.994
all taking of anything not given."

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.080
I think you're terrified
of what you've done.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.997
I'm not going to ask what you've done.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:09.868
I made up my mind. I'm not going
to ask you anything like that.

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.520
But I think that rather than
evade punishment,

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.034
you've taken it into your own hands.

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:18.679
It's all right, Daddy.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:21.911
I can believe that
you can't understand.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.271
I don't believe it's a difficult
conclusion to reach, honey.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:28.238
I don't think I'm the only person
who, seeing you here,

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.675
would come up with that idea.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:35.038
You want to do penance,
but this is not penance.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.475
Not even the state
would punish you like this.

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:38.879
- Daddy.
- No.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.678
Look at what
you've done to yourself.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.751
You could die if you keep this up.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.591
But only to be reborn.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:53.519
Will you at least take off that mask
while we're talking so I can see you?

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.750
See me stutter, do you mean?

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:01.275
My stutter was only my way
of doing no violence to the air.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.955
Well, maybe you would
have been better off with your stutter

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.110
if you had to go this far.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.278
Where have you been?

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.999
Did you come to Newark
to help me find you?

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.311
I got a ride and here I was, you see?

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:32.108
Coincidence? That's all?

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.958
The world is not a place on which
I have any influence or wish to have any.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:44.915
As to what constitutes a coincidence,
you and I, Daddy.

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.669
Where have you been all these years?

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.074
After Hamlins, I went to Sheila's.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.397
Sheila Smith, your therapist?

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.152
She kept me for a few days

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.320
and then she sent me on to people
in the underground.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:08.311
- She sent you to them? Sheila?
- Yes.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.397
They took care of me.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.715
But it wasn't safe to stay anywhere.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.958
In two months, I had 15 aliases
and moved every four or five days.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.759
I took a name from a tombstone
in a cemetery.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.114
Merry...

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:32.352
One morning, I received a phone call
that I was to go to the Greyhound station.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.351
They gave me a ticket to Chicago.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.920
I would stay there for two days
and then travel to Oregon,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.197
where there would be sanctuary.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.238
I was raped the night I arrived
in Chica... cago.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.278
Oh, my God.

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.871
Held captive and raped and robbed.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.837
Come home with me, Merry.

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.274
You go, Daddy.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.558
Leave you?
You think I could leave you?

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.200
- After everything I've...
- You must.

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.188
That's exactly what you must do:
is go.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.469
No. You're asking me
to do something impossible.

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.876
I've looked for you for so long.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.757
I can't.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.557
Come home.
Come home, Merry.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.036
Please go now, Daddy.

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.512
Please go.

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.477
What's wrong, Swede?

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.437
You never told me.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.754
- You've seen her, you've seen Merry.
- She came to your house.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.797
Why did you let her go?

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.912
Answer me!
You knew.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.752
It was on the news.

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.920
She blew up a building
and you hid her in your house?

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.713
When I heard,
I couldn't believe it.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.270
But I was her therapist.
I couldn't betray her.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:18.072
You did betray her!

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.628
You sent her to people,
the worst people in the world,

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.517
the ones who got her
to do what she did.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:25.398
That's not true. Merry believed
in what she did.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.675
No! A man died!

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.558
A good man. I'll never believe
that that's what she wanted.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.119
They manipulated her.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.351
They used her for their crazy,
fucking politics.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.793
You used her.

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.070
You're trying to make this
my responsibility.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.116
You and your radical friends.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:45.159
They don't believe in peace or war
or the Vietnamese people.

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.435
They just wanted to blow a hole
in the world,

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.717
the biggest hole they could
in everything that was good!

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.634
They don't care if people get killed!
And you sent her right to them!

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:58.872
I sent her to where she'd be safe.
She couldn't stay here.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.191
She was a troubled girl.
Going to prison was not what she...

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.276
You think she was troubled then?

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.079
Oh, my God, Sheila,
you haven't seen her now!

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.555
How she lives! Where she's been!

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.200
- She was raped!
- No, don't say that.

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.256
Listen, I'm telling you something!
Did you hear me?

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.635
- Stop it.
- She's been raped!

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.519
My daughter!

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.232
She's sick in her body...

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.878
sick in her mind!

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.595
Dawn says to get
the steaks going, Swede.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.034
Right. Okay.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.839
She wants me inside,
helping with the corn.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.913
And it's going to be
close, and he is out at home plate.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.630
He's out! It's a double play
with a tag from Ray Fosse.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.030
And here comes Mets manager,
Yogi Berra, to argue with the ump...

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.078
Ah, I don't believe it.

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.671
God damn this team!

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.197
- I thought Bill told you to put the...
- I can't.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.751
I need to talk to you.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.834
I hope this is important.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.037
Leaving the Orcutts
to your parents like this...

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:58.158
Look, have you seen where Bill and I
moved the sunroom?

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.959
He was so wrong
about the Western light.

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.953
It's about Merry.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.352
What about Merry?

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.837
All this time, we've had no idea
where she is.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:15.559
And we aren't going to.

01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:19.030
If she'd wanted us to find her,
she would have told us how.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.998
She hasn't wanted to.
We've had to accept that.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.594
- Dawn...
- We've had to accept that and we have.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.114
- But just suppose...
- Suppose what?

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.388
What?

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.756
Suppose that we knew
where she was.

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.714
Go on. What is it now?

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.758
Do you have a new lead?
Some hunch?

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.671
- Some information?
- More than that.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.637
Why? Did someone call?

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.756
Some nut who saw her
at an airport in Phoenix

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.296
or at a fucking Hare Krishna meeting?
Is that what it is, Swede?

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:51.976
Will you listen?
I'm telling you something.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.594
When are you going
to give up on her?

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.353
I can't.

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:04.077
I tried so hard, but I can't.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:12.752
Our old life is gone, Swede.

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.033
It's dead.

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.879
This.

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.916
This is our only future.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.791
Excuse me,
we have guests.

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:42.308
Nixon.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.198
Watergate. It's all I hear.
Day and night, he goes on...

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:49.273
Von Ehrlichman,
von Haldeman, von Nixon.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.078
They're all mamzers.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:54.072
I agree with you, Mr. Levov.
They should all go to jail.

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:57.470
- And I'm a Republican!
- Good for you, Mrs. Orcutt.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.312
Are you okay, son?

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.518
- Sure I am, Mom.
- Oh, my boy.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.750
Who could want a better son?

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.200
Jesse, don't you think
you've had enough, dear?

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.077
Can I get you something, Dad?

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:28.357
No. Rest,
you don't look so great.

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.596
I'll get you another drink.

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.108
Not now.

01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:57.708
Not now.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:22.068
Seymour?

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.639
Don't say anything!

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.672
- Swede.
- No.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.514
Why are apes here?

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:51.753
Why are kangaroos here?

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.589
Life is just a short space of time

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.353
in which you were alive.

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.791
Merry.

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:37.309
I have to ask you something.

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.198
I have to ask you something
I promised I wouldn't ask,

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.554
but I must.

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:44.751
You can ask me anything.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.033
Did you do it?

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:53.431
Do what, Daddy?

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:55.670
Plant the bomb in the post office.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.434
Yes.

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.072
Who made you do it?

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.680
- Lyndon Johnson.
- No, who talked you into it?

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:15.115
How strongly you still crave the idea
of your innocent child.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.588
Was it Rita?

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:21.596
- Who's Rita?
- Rita, the girl you sent,

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:23.318
the one who came to my office.

01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:27.348
I never sent you anyone.

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.636
Was this just some kind of game you were
playing with me, the two of you?

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.439
I relinquish all cruelty,
I relinquish all control,

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.192
all influence over the world.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.397
Do you? Do you?

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:43.597
Well, you have
influence over me, Merry.

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:46.114
I renounce all attachments
whether little or much,

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.310
small or great,
living or lifeless.

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.192
Were there others?

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:55.232
Did others die?

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.231
Were you involved
in other bombings?

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.918
Two.

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.751
You built the bombs.

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.035
I built and planted the bombs.

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.512
Was anyone killed?

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.714
Yes.

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:15.514
Who?

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.514
People.

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.078
How many people?

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.314
Three.

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.158
I'm going in now.

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.673
Don't go away from me.
Don't go anywhere.

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.270
Daddy, how much suffering
do you want?

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.793
Who are you?

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.799
Where is my daughter?

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.553
My daughter did not kill four people.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.232
Say it isn't you.

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.477
Say it isn't you!

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:27.835
Look...

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.909
Merry.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:34.834
Your ballet shoes,

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:37.070
your riding ribbons,
all your things.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.672
My stuttering book.

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.516
Why have you
brought these things?

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.235
Does it mean that
you aren't coming back?

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:08.634
Because if it does,
maybe that's best.

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:12.508
Merry...

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.999
I'm your father.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.754
I made you and I found you.

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:26.272
And there's no way I can ever lose you
or you can ever lose me again.

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:34.357
Let me take you home.

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.071
I can't leave you here.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.558
You've seen me.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.552
Please go now.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:54.273
If you love me,
you'll let me be.

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:32.311
That was to be
the last time he ever saw her.

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.036
He never got over Merry.

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.997
He never got over her...

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.511
and never gave up on her.

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.512
It was good to see you.

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.196
Will you excuse me?

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:13.114
- Are you taking off?
- Oh, there you are. Uh...

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:17.478
Yeah. These days I'm asleep
on my feet after 9:00.

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.471
Yeah, me too.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.552
Uh, well, it was good
to see you. Really.

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:25.028
Well, night.

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.268
Jerry.

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:34.991
The Swede's funeral tomorrow,
do you mind if I come?

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.753
No. No, not at all.
I'd be happy to see you.

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.395
You remember.
You were there.

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.351
He called you "Skip."

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:56.678
As we prepare to recite
the mourner's Kaddish,

01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:59.314
we remember the Swede
one last time.

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:03.234
A football hero, a baseball hero,

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.436
an officer in the Marines.

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:08.677
What Merry blew up
with that bomb of hers

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.797
was nothing less than his life.

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:15.793
He never got past
the Rimrock Bomber,

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:20.396
a girl who perhaps didn't deserve
anything from him,

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.712
who wasn't on the same playing field
as him or anybody else.

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:28.759
At this time, please rise
for the mourner's Kaddish.

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:36.718
You come at people
with an open mind

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:39.593
and yet you never fail
to get them wrong.

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:44.351
You get them wrong
while you're with them

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.399
or you tell someone about them
and get them wrong again.

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.829
That's how we know we 're alive.

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.679
We are wrong.

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.439
About the Swede,

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:03.080
how life was going to open its arms

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:06.317
and shower blessings
upon him.

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:10.552
I was never more wrong
about anyone in my life.

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:23.678
Thank you. It's nice to see you.
Thanks for coming today.
