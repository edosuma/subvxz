01:07.350 --> 01:09.511
Trevor!

01:13.523 --> 01:14.820
Max.

01:41.951 --> 01:43.543
Whoa, whoa.

01:45.454 --> 01:48.981
Although Wegener was ridiculed
by the scientific community...

01:49.158 --> 01:51.126
...he was eventually found
to be correct...

01:51.294 --> 01:54.320
...in his theory of an original
supercontinent called Pangaea.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.490
Yeah. Okay.

02:03.072 --> 02:06.633
Ah. Come to papa.

02:06.976 --> 02:08.705
Hey, Leonard.

02:09.277 --> 02:11.212
Hey, man.

02:11.380 --> 02:14.577
- Dude, you ain't gonna be happy.
- Why?

02:14.750 --> 02:17.048
- It's Kitzens.
- I see.

02:17.653 --> 02:20.645
- Hello.
- Trevor, there's my favorite colleague.

02:20.823 --> 02:22.154
- How are you, Alan?
- I'm good.

02:22.325 --> 02:24.589
- How's that Con Drift class of yours going?
- Fine.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.354
Does it get echoey in there
with so few students?

02:29.398 --> 02:31.366
So, what do you got on the books?
I'm busy.

02:31.534 --> 02:34.731
No, no, I can see how busy you are.

02:34.904 --> 02:38.101
So I'll try to be
as quick as possible here.

02:38.274 --> 02:41.835
The university is pulling the plug
on your brother's lab.

02:42.011 --> 02:43.035
Pulling the plug?

02:43.212 --> 02:46.113
Yeah, it's gonna finally give us
all the storage space we need.

02:46.282 --> 02:49.217
Let's get something straight here,
this facility is dedicated...

02:49.385 --> 02:53.287
...to the research of Maxwell Anderson's
theories predicting the volcanic fissures...

02:53.456 --> 02:55.014
Which have never been proven.

02:55.191 --> 03:00.288
I mean, how many of your late brother's
sensors are even still active? One, two...?

03:00.463 --> 03:01.930
- Three.
- It used to be 29.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.066
This is the wrong time to shut us down.

03:04.233 --> 03:09.000
I have got seismic activity in Bolivia.
I got a 13 millimeter shift in Mongolia.

03:09.171 --> 03:11.366
Alan, you can't shut us down.
Keep the lab open.

03:11.540 --> 03:15.943
- It's all I've got left of Max.
- It's been 10 years since Max, Trevor.

03:16.712 --> 03:20.409
I am sorry about all this. I really am.

03:33.429 --> 03:35.659
<i>Trevor, are you there? It's Elizabeth.</i>

03:35.831 --> 03:37.059
<i>Pick up, please.</i>

03:37.233 --> 03:41.567
<i>Okay. Well, uh, we are on the 95,</i>
<i>and we're heading your way.</i>

03:41.737 --> 03:44.001
<i>You wanna say hi</i>
<i>to your Uncle Trevor, Sean?</i>

03:44.173 --> 03:45.834
<i>No.</i>

03:46.008 --> 03:47.600
<i>Just say hello.</i>
- No.

03:47.777 --> 03:50.302
<i>I don't want to.</i>
- Oh, no.

03:51.113 --> 03:52.740
<i>Hey, it's your sister-in-law again.</i>

03:52.915 --> 03:55.247
<i>Just wanted to make sure</i>
<i>what time you'd be home...</i>

03:55.418 --> 03:57.181
<i>... because we'll be there around 6.</i>

03:57.620 --> 03:59.144
<i>Okay. Well, we'll be on my cell.</i>

03:59.322 --> 04:02.189
- Oh, boy.
- <i>Sean's looking forward to seeing you.</i>

04:02.358 --> 04:03.825
- <i>Right, Sean?</i>
- <i>Negatory.</i>

04:03.993 --> 04:06.791
<i>I'm getting worried that</i>
<i>we might've gotten our signals crossed.</i>

04:06.963 --> 04:08.123
<i>Please call me.</i>

04:09.498 --> 04:10.829
<i>I'm not home. Leave me a message.</i>

04:11.000 --> 04:13.867
<i>Trevor, we're pulling up</i>
<i>in front of your building.</i>

04:24.347 --> 04:26.679
Trevor, you in there?

04:28.184 --> 04:29.708
Hi.

04:30.519 --> 04:32.146
- Hey.
- How are you, Elizabeth?

04:32.321 --> 04:34.687
- Oh, you're home.
- It's so good to see you.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.256
You too.

04:36.993 --> 04:40.326
- How are you? I just got your messages.
- Uh-huh.

04:40.496 --> 04:43.590
- You forgot, didn't you?
- I didn't forget.

04:43.766 --> 04:45.028
How could I forget?

04:45.201 --> 04:46.691
- You didn't forget?
- I...

04:49.772 --> 04:52.036
I forgot.
It doesn't mean I haven't been...

04:52.208 --> 04:54.199
...looking forward
to time with my nephew.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.242
I haven't seen him since he was 9?

04:56.412 --> 04:58.710
- Seven.
- Wow. Ha-ha.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.111
So how long
is he gonna be staying again?

05:01.717 --> 05:03.844
- Ten days.
- Is that what we said?

05:04.020 --> 05:07.114
Hey, Sean. How are you?

05:07.890 --> 05:09.016
Looking good.

05:10.126 --> 05:12.424
- Is that one of those Game Boys?
- It's a PSP.

05:12.595 --> 05:16.793
- Cool.
- Sean, get up, say hi to your uncle.

05:18.934 --> 05:20.697
Hi to your uncle.

05:22.204 --> 05:26.641
Last time I saw you,
you were about this high.

05:26.809 --> 05:29.573
- Oh! Ha-ha.
- Yeah, good one.

05:31.714 --> 05:33.807
You got that?
Okay, you've got all my numbers.

05:33.983 --> 05:36.281
You've got your ticket
and passport in your bag.

05:36.452 --> 05:38.477
I will be there to pick you up in Ottawa.

05:38.654 --> 05:42.454
And by then I'll have found us a house
and we can start on this big new adventure.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.616
- Pretty exciting stuff, huh?
- Yeah, it's great.

05:44.794 --> 05:47.661
We get to be Canadians. Thrilling, eh?

05:49.865 --> 05:51.059
Just let yourself in.

05:53.069 --> 05:56.232
- It will be good for him, being with you.
- Yeah.

05:56.405 --> 05:58.464
Who knows?
Maybe it will be good for you too.

06:03.679 --> 06:05.408
This is for you.

06:05.581 --> 06:06.741
What...? Is this Sean's?

06:06.916 --> 06:08.816
No, it's Max's.

06:08.984 --> 06:11.350
- Max's?
- Yeah.

06:28.104 --> 06:31.596
So, hey, dude. This is gonna be fun.

06:31.774 --> 06:33.207
A couple of dudes hanging out.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.842
Five days, maybe a week.

06:35.010 --> 06:37.501
You know, doing dude stuff,
what dudes do.

06:38.614 --> 06:40.707
You like baseball?
You know what we should do?

06:40.883 --> 06:42.612
We should go get in a batting cage.

06:43.786 --> 06:46.516
Yeah, okay, listen.
I don't like this any more than you do.

06:46.689 --> 06:48.884
As long as you keep stocked
with Mountain Dew...

06:49.058 --> 06:51.822
...and TiVo <i>Family Guy,</i>
we'll get along fine.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.519
- Sure.
- Oh, wow.

06:54.697 --> 06:57.063
- That's an awesome coin collection.
- Oh.

06:57.233 --> 07:00.669
Well, kind of a pet project of mine.

07:00.836 --> 07:04.795
- Yeah, it's really nifty.
- Thanks.

07:05.141 --> 07:07.336
You hungry?
We could order in, you know.

07:07.510 --> 07:11.105
Maybe some pizza, Chinese, Thai food?

07:11.280 --> 07:12.872
Subs? Or something like that?

07:15.417 --> 07:17.885
- Wow.
- What's that?

07:18.154 --> 07:24.582
Well, it's a box of possessions
of a really great guy.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.250
Your dad.

07:29.064 --> 07:30.827
His old ball glove.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.264
Mom doesn't talk about him very much.

07:34.436 --> 07:36.131
Well, you can take my word for it.

07:36.305 --> 07:38.637
He was one of those few people...

07:38.807 --> 07:43.540
...who are just exceptional
at everything they do.

07:45.447 --> 07:50.350
Ooh. You see this?
This was your old man's PSP.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.118
- A yo-yo?
- Don't be dissing the yo-yo.

07:53.289 --> 07:55.883
This is physics at work.
You got your centrifugal force.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.720
Your gravitational pull,
you got your potential energy.

07:58.894 --> 08:00.691
And in ancient times, did you know...

08:00.863 --> 08:04.026
...that this was actually used
as a hunting implement?

08:04.200 --> 08:05.224
Watch.

08:08.904 --> 08:12.101
- Hey, here, let me try.
- Yeah, you should probably take it.

08:17.179 --> 08:19.204
I have no idea what this is.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.576
Hello.

08:27.890 --> 08:29.357
This was his favorite book.

08:29.792 --> 08:33.558
Jules Verne's
<i>A Journey to the Center of the Earth.</i>

08:35.798 --> 08:38.460
You know, I think that was
on my summer reading list once.

08:38.634 --> 08:42.900
- I never got to it.
- That's too bad, it's a good read.

08:43.072 --> 08:47.771
To him, it wasn't just science fiction,
it was inspiration.

08:48.577 --> 08:51.978
He used to read this to me
when I was a really little kid.

08:54.283 --> 08:57.081
Hello. What are these notes?

09:03.626 --> 09:09.656
"Magma temperatures reach 1150
in Mongolia"?

09:10.499 --> 09:12.433
"Bolivia."

09:12.968 --> 09:14.765
"Hawaii."

09:17.339 --> 09:18.704
Look out!

09:26.081 --> 09:28.606
Hey, Sean, let's go check out my lab.

09:29.585 --> 09:31.314
So it couldn't wait for tomorrow?

09:32.955 --> 09:35.446
"Tectonophysics is the science of now,
not tomorrow."

09:35.624 --> 09:38.149
It's about seismic events
that occur in an instant.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.192
Here, look at this.

09:41.297 --> 09:45.131
You got Hawaii, Bolivia, Mongolia.

09:45.301 --> 09:48.634
And the conditions today are almost
exactly what they were in July '97.

09:48.804 --> 09:50.931
What's the big deal about July '97?

09:51.106 --> 09:53.700
Sean, that was the year
that your dad went missing.

09:53.876 --> 09:57.039
Now, look, you see this column
of numbers here?

09:57.613 --> 10:02.107
If the 753, right here, was a 752,
then it would be...

10:09.992 --> 10:11.084
Exactly the same.

10:13.128 --> 10:16.325
What do these little blips mean?

10:16.498 --> 10:19.490
Don't touch anything.
Those little blips are my life's work.

10:19.668 --> 10:22.068
These four little blips
are your entire life's work?

10:22.471 --> 10:24.666
Three. Three little blips.

10:26.842 --> 10:30.869
One, two, three, four.

10:36.018 --> 10:37.042
Iceland.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.948
This makes sense.

10:39.121 --> 10:42.249
Max saw the readings 10 years ago,
and he took off to investigate.

10:42.424 --> 10:45.882
Now, if the readings are the same today
as they were then...

10:46.061 --> 10:48.621
...this may be my only chance
to find out what happened.

10:48.797 --> 10:50.856
- I'm gonna need your passport.
- For what?

10:51.033 --> 10:54.400
I'm sorry, I have to get you to Canada
a little earlier than we planned.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.333
What are you talking about?

10:56.505 --> 11:01.067
I'm talking about this.
<i>A Journey to the Center of the Earth.</i>

11:02.277 --> 11:06.714
It's all set in Iceland,
which is where he must've gone.

11:07.549 --> 11:08.948
These are all my dad's notes?

11:12.287 --> 11:13.777
Look...

11:17.192 --> 11:18.591
...Max and l...

11:18.761 --> 11:23.721
Your dad and I were talking about
the possibility of volcanic tubes existing...

11:23.899 --> 11:27.494
...that went down past the mantle,
towards the center of the Earth.

11:27.669 --> 11:29.933
And that's what I think
he went looking for.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.306
Sorry, I gotta put you on a flight
to Ottawa in the morning.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.500
- And I'm calling Icelandair.
- No, no, look.

11:37.012 --> 11:38.343
- Hey.
- I just got here, okay?

11:38.514 --> 11:40.106
You're not gonna go and ditch me.

11:40.282 --> 11:44.878
I was the person who found your life's work
fourth little blip thingy in the first place.

11:45.053 --> 11:47.544
- This is my brother we're talking about.
- It's my dad.

11:47.723 --> 11:50.783
Now, I don't have to be in Ottawa
for 10 days. I'm going with you.

11:50.959 --> 11:53.450
Know how much to book
a last-minute flight to Reykjavík?

11:53.629 --> 11:55.392
Something tells me you got it covered.

12:09.077 --> 12:12.843
"Descend, bold traveler,
into the crater of the jokul of Sneffels...

12:13.015 --> 12:16.610
...which the shadow of Scartaris touches
before the kalends of July...

12:16.785 --> 12:18.980
...and you will attain
the center of the Earth."

12:19.588 --> 12:20.782
Ooh.

12:21.223 --> 12:22.884
Sorry.

12:27.596 --> 12:28.893
What are you doing?

12:29.064 --> 12:32.124
I'm deciphering these notations
that your father made in this book.

12:32.301 --> 12:34.826
I think there's a code
behind the pairing of letters.

12:35.003 --> 12:37.494
It might have something to do
with the periodic table.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.641
For instance, I've got S-A, I-S, G-G.

12:39.942 --> 12:44.003
I believe that P-B is on the periodic table
and that's plumbum.

12:44.179 --> 12:48.309
- Plumbum means lead.
- What's "Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson"?

12:48.484 --> 12:50.042
What?

12:50.385 --> 12:53.081
Well, it's right here. Read it down.
Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson.

12:54.890 --> 12:56.619
Oh. Uh...

12:56.792 --> 12:59.784
Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson, that's...

13:01.530 --> 13:04.021
That's a clue. Maybe that's a place.

13:04.199 --> 13:05.496
It could be a thing.

13:06.001 --> 13:08.469
- What are you doing?
- I am Googling at 30,000 feet.

13:08.637 --> 13:12.004
- Are you supposed to be doing that?
- Welcome to the 21 st century.

13:12.174 --> 13:14.665
- Okay. Here.
- It's a person.

13:14.977 --> 13:17.036
"Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson,
executive director...

13:17.212 --> 13:19.772
...of Ásgeirsson Institute
for Progressive Volcanology."

13:19.948 --> 13:21.438
Max would've known this guy.

13:21.617 --> 13:26.452
I knew it was a good thing to bring you.
His institute has gotta be our first stop.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.322
Are we there yet?

13:33.495 --> 13:36.589
If you mean annoying, yeah, we're there.

13:37.132 --> 13:40.158
- You know, you're going kind of slow.
- I'm going kind of safe.

13:40.335 --> 13:42.929
I just saw a goat in the passing lane.

13:43.105 --> 13:45.164
When's the whole adventure thing
gonna begin?

13:45.340 --> 13:47.069
Let me give you something fun to do.

13:47.843 --> 13:49.743
Navigate.

13:50.445 --> 13:51.810
Where are we?

13:52.481 --> 13:57.441
Have we passed Havanschlicht?

13:57.619 --> 14:00.019
- Havanschlicht?
- Yeah.

14:00.188 --> 14:02.281
I don't know.

14:02.457 --> 14:04.618
Have we passed Eingarsstadir?

14:04.793 --> 14:06.317
- I don't know.
- Reynivír?

14:06.495 --> 14:07.894
- I don't know.
- Húsavík?

14:08.063 --> 14:09.325
No.
- Grundarhol?

14:09.498 --> 14:11.796
No.
- Stifflarschtarder?

14:11.967 --> 14:13.161
Stifflardschtarder?

14:13.335 --> 14:17.772
How about Koldukardarskinoquue?
- What?

14:18.640 --> 14:21.006
We're definitely lost.
- We're not lost.

14:21.176 --> 14:22.541
Just look for an institution.

14:22.711 --> 14:27.273
What's an institution look like?
- I don't know, it looks big and institutional.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.781
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

14:31.153 --> 14:35.112
Hey, look, there's a little shack up there.
We can stop there and ask for directions.

14:36.959 --> 14:40.952
- We're not lost.
- Oh, no, definitely not.

14:43.365 --> 14:46.061
What's this? A ski shack?

14:47.002 --> 14:48.128
"Ásgeirsson...

14:49.638 --> 14:51.435
...lnstitute for Progressive Volcanology."

14:51.607 --> 14:53.040
I told you I'd find it.

14:53.208 --> 14:54.607
Alrighty.

14:54.776 --> 14:58.007
- Not too shabby.
- All right.

15:01.183 --> 15:05.051
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Icelandic.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.158
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hello.

15:12.928 --> 15:14.862
- I'm Hannah.
- Oh, how do you do? Hi.

15:15.030 --> 15:20.058
I'm Trev... Professor Anderson.
I'm visiting from America. Um...

15:20.636 --> 15:23.537
- This is Sean, my nephew.
- I'm Sean.

15:24.039 --> 15:25.666
Hi, Sean.

15:25.841 --> 15:29.208
I was wondering if I could
possibly speak with, forgive me here...

15:29.378 --> 15:31.243
...Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson?

15:32.014 --> 15:33.447
Um...

15:33.615 --> 15:35.810
Well, Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson is dead.

15:36.618 --> 15:39.178
- Dead?
- Yeah, he died three winters ago.

15:39.354 --> 15:40.685
Oh. Uh...

15:40.856 --> 15:42.448
So do you run the institute?

15:42.624 --> 15:44.558
Nobody does. There is no institute.

15:44.726 --> 15:49.060
- There's a sign down the road that says...
- Progressive volcanology was a failed idea.

15:49.231 --> 15:52.894
Like, you know, the Berlin Wall
and eight-track tapes.

15:53.435 --> 15:54.902
I see.

15:55.637 --> 15:57.002
Well, did you work with him?

15:57.172 --> 15:59.037
No, no. He was my father.

16:03.679 --> 16:06.375
Yeah? I know it. What about it?

16:06.548 --> 16:10.211
Well, this book belonged
to my late brother, Max.

16:10.385 --> 16:11.409
Max Anderson?

16:11.586 --> 16:16.285
We believe that he may have been
in contact with your father.

16:16.458 --> 16:19.450
- Your brother was a Vernian.
- What's a Vernian?

16:19.628 --> 16:23.223
Someone that believes that the writings
of Jules Verne were actual fact.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.800
I mean, the guy
was a science fiction writer.

16:26.968 --> 16:30.699
And yet this society of believers
regarded Verne like a visionary.

16:30.872 --> 16:33.739
My father
was the biggest Vernian of them all.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.275
My brother was no Vernian.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.245
This was my father's copy.

16:47.422 --> 16:49.083
Take a look.

16:52.027 --> 16:56.088
See, the markings are exactly the same.
Your brother was a Vernian.

16:58.767 --> 17:02.601
Wow, my dad was kind of out there.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.968
- You didn't know him, Sean.
- I'm starting to think you didn't either.

17:06.141 --> 17:08.769
He was no member
of some secret society.

17:09.377 --> 17:13.074
- What are you guys doing here?
- I'm a scientist, I'm a professor.

17:13.248 --> 17:16.944
I'm here because there are seismic sensors
going off 30 klicks north of here...

17:17.118 --> 17:19.087
...that we think
that we should check into.

17:19.253 --> 17:21.848
And that's the reason that we're here,
plain and simple.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.281
Okay.

17:24.459 --> 17:26.790
You know,
there are no roads to the north.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.554
Well...

17:28.730 --> 17:31.494
I'm a mountain guide.
I can take you there, professor.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.829
- Great.
- That's great, I love hiking.

17:34.002 --> 17:36.698
- I would appreciate that. That'd be great.
- Good.

17:37.606 --> 17:40.074
- Call me Trevor.
- You can call me Sean.

17:40.242 --> 17:42.608
So it will be 5000 kronur to go up there.

17:42.778 --> 17:44.507
Five grand a day? No problem.

17:45.247 --> 17:46.305
An hour.

17:48.183 --> 17:50.413
Do you accept rolls of quarters?

18:18.580 --> 18:22.846
Come on, boys.
I wanna be home by sundown.

18:24.085 --> 18:26.918
Hey, you think you can slow down
a little bit, please?

18:34.496 --> 18:36.088
- Dibs.
- What?

18:36.731 --> 18:38.699
I got dibs on the mountain guide.

18:41.870 --> 18:45.067
- You're 13.
- Sorry, called it.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.232
- Thirteen-year-olds don't get dibs.
- Get over it.

18:57.686 --> 18:59.017
We're getting closer.

18:59.354 --> 19:03.188
All right, just watch your step there.
Mount Sneffels is deceptively treacherous.

19:03.358 --> 19:06.555
- What's Sneffels?
- Well, why don't you tell him, professor?

19:06.728 --> 19:11.188
Sneffels is the name of the mountain
where this character Liedenbrock...

19:11.366 --> 19:15.029
...apparently found a portal
to the center of the Earth.

19:15.203 --> 19:17.728
Let's just find that sensor of yours,
professor.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.874
There it is.

19:20.842 --> 19:22.036
Yes.

19:22.210 --> 19:24.405
Well, what do you need to do with it?

19:24.579 --> 19:27.070
I gotta unlock it.
It's got, like, a black box...

19:29.584 --> 19:31.814
...that has recorded
all of the seismic activity...

19:31.987 --> 19:34.080
...that's transpired in the last 10 years.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.655
Could tell me a lot about Max.

19:36.491 --> 19:38.823
And what he was doing
when he went missing.

19:38.994 --> 19:41.485
Trevor, I'm really sorry,
we're gonna have to go now.

19:41.663 --> 19:42.823
Must be corroded.

19:43.431 --> 19:45.763
Trevor, we need to... Whoa.

19:50.038 --> 19:53.303
Okay, we need to take cover.
Come on, Sean. Right now.

19:53.475 --> 19:54.499
I'll be right there.

19:54.676 --> 19:57.770
- Trevor, just leave it for now.
- I've almost got it.

19:58.546 --> 19:59.911
We need to take cover now.

20:02.217 --> 20:03.980
Come on. Trevor.

20:04.152 --> 20:05.983
- Uncle Trevor.
- Get in here.

20:07.022 --> 20:10.253
- Yes. Oh!
- Watch out.

20:10.425 --> 20:11.585
Hurry up. Come on.

20:12.460 --> 20:15.691
Trevor,
the sensor's attracting the lightning.

20:15.864 --> 20:18.856
- Drop it. Drop the sensor.
- What? I'm not gonna drop it.

20:19.034 --> 20:22.367
Hurry!
- It's attracting the lightning!

20:39.688 --> 20:41.679
Trevor?

20:43.325 --> 20:45.020
- Trevor?
- I'm all right.

20:49.664 --> 20:50.961
Sean?

20:52.067 --> 20:54.831
- Sean, you all right?
- I'm good.

21:00.642 --> 21:05.602
- Okay, everybody, just stay calm.
- Guys, come on, you gotta help me dig.

21:06.514 --> 21:08.277
Come on.

21:14.322 --> 21:17.018
- Forget it, it's no use.
- Forget it?

21:19.894 --> 21:21.054
She's right.

21:21.229 --> 21:26.861
There must be about 60 or 70 tons
of boulders on top of us.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.765
Take us about a month
to dig out of here.

21:31.039 --> 21:34.008
- We have to find another way.
- What if there is no other way?

21:34.175 --> 21:36.666
There's always another way, Sean.

21:38.513 --> 21:39.571
What else have you got?

21:39.748 --> 21:44.879
Signal flares, first aid, some rope, blankets
and a couple of protein bars.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.145
But they're on a ration.

21:46.321 --> 21:50.485
- Don't know how long we'll be trapped for.
- Trapped? Is that what we are?

21:53.094 --> 21:54.721
She... No, she didn't mean that.

21:55.997 --> 21:59.330
- Sean, hey, what are you doing?
- God, I'm not getting any service.

21:59.534 --> 22:02.128
Sean, you're not gonna get any signal
down here, okay?

22:02.303 --> 22:04.897
Put this away.
Okay, don't worry about it.

22:05.073 --> 22:08.236
- We'll find another way out, all right?
- Okay.

22:09.644 --> 22:11.737
One of these
might snake back to the surface.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.437
How do we know which one to take?

22:14.416 --> 22:16.850
My gut says we go right.

22:17.018 --> 22:18.417
Come on.

22:22.690 --> 22:26.057
Looks promising.

22:30.832 --> 22:34.359
Just put one foot in front of the other.
We'll be out of here in no time.

22:36.504 --> 22:38.768
Looking good.

22:40.975 --> 22:44.877
Don't worry, direction is my sixth sense.

22:45.580 --> 22:49.414
Pay attention, Sean.
It's just like doing field work.

22:49.584 --> 22:50.949
I used to love doing field work.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.312
- Watch out.
- Ah!

23:07.569 --> 23:09.833
You're not studying rocks in a lab,
professor.

23:10.004 --> 23:13.462
- This is life or death here.
- Yeah, thanks.

23:14.609 --> 23:16.668
You owe me one.

23:30.792 --> 23:32.487
What does this say?

23:35.230 --> 23:37.061
That means keep out.

23:37.232 --> 23:40.429
- Maybe that's decent advice.
- No, no. This is great news.

23:40.602 --> 23:43.969
This might lead us to an old mine shaft
and that could be our way out.

23:44.139 --> 23:47.233
- How deep do you think it is?
- Can you give me one of those flares?

23:47.408 --> 23:50.468
Thank you. Sean, look at your watch.

23:50.645 --> 23:53.011
I'm gonna light this
and drop it over the edge...

23:53.181 --> 23:56.241
...and I want you to tell me
how many seconds pass before it stops.

23:56.417 --> 23:57.679
Okay.

24:00.355 --> 24:03.153
Here we go. Three, two...

24:04.359 --> 24:05.849
Oh, God!

24:13.168 --> 24:14.499
What?

24:14.669 --> 24:16.432
What was that?

24:26.147 --> 24:28.047
Yup, magnesium.

24:28.583 --> 24:30.551
Must run in veins
all through these walls.

24:31.252 --> 24:34.085
Magnesium is kind of flammable,
isn't it, professor?

24:34.589 --> 24:38.081
Yeah, used in flares,
used in gun powder, matchsticks.

24:38.259 --> 24:42.923
Right, well, maybe gun powders and flares
aren't such a good idea down here.

24:46.534 --> 24:47.865
Thank you.

24:48.036 --> 24:49.264
It's the same principle.

24:50.705 --> 24:53.674
- You ready, Sean?
- Yeah, go ahead.

24:53.841 --> 24:56.366
Three, two...

24:57.779 --> 24:59.212
One.

25:00.648 --> 25:01.672
Two.

25:03.017 --> 25:04.609
Almost three.

25:05.286 --> 25:07.618
Thirty-two squared by... It's 200 feet.

25:09.023 --> 25:10.354
That's no problem.

25:10.525 --> 25:14.120
It's about your basic 20-story high-rise.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.627
- You got enough rope?
- I always have enough rope.

25:16.798 --> 25:18.891
Well, no problem for what?

25:19.067 --> 25:20.329
Rappelling down in there.

25:20.969 --> 25:22.800
We're gonna rappel down
that deep, dark hole?

25:22.971 --> 25:24.734
What, you got a problem with that?

25:24.906 --> 25:26.567
- Pfft.
- What's the matter?

25:26.741 --> 25:28.936
There's no way
we should be rappelling down.

25:29.110 --> 25:32.443
What are you talking about? You're
man enough to call dibs on the guide.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.605
- But not enough to climb down a rope.
- Guys.

25:34.782 --> 25:38.411
- Calling dibs on the mountain guide...
- No one gets dibs on the mountain guide.

25:40.154 --> 25:41.280
We're going down there.

25:44.726 --> 25:47.559
Steady, steady.

25:48.196 --> 25:50.562
Remember, we're all connected.

25:51.833 --> 25:53.425
It's okay.

25:55.403 --> 25:57.030
Looking good.

25:58.940 --> 26:00.908
It's all good down here.

26:01.709 --> 26:03.267
Way down here.

26:03.444 --> 26:04.911
You guys are coming down, right?

26:05.079 --> 26:08.446
All right, Sean, I'm gonna start
lowering you down really, really slowly.

26:08.616 --> 26:12.347
So just lean back
and keep your feet up high.

26:14.622 --> 26:15.816
You're okay, Sean.

26:15.990 --> 26:18.891
We're tethered together,
so nothing bad is gonna happen.

26:19.694 --> 26:21.525
Yeah, sure.

26:22.497 --> 26:23.896
Good.

26:28.036 --> 26:29.526
Sean, keep walking.

26:29.704 --> 26:31.899
You have to keep walking.

26:33.641 --> 26:35.131
Good.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.176
Hey, you're looking pretty good there.

26:39.347 --> 26:41.474
- Sure you haven't done this before?
- Shut up.

26:42.850 --> 26:44.715
Hey, you mind?
Watch your step, will you?

26:44.886 --> 26:46.581
I'm hanging on for my life here.

26:47.889 --> 26:50.323
Okay, Sean,
just make conversation with me.

26:51.592 --> 26:53.992
So, Hannah, do you come here often?

26:54.429 --> 26:55.521
Oh, give me a break.

26:55.697 --> 26:58.222
That can't be the best line
you can come up with.

26:58.399 --> 27:02.165
- I'm making conversation with her.
- No, Sean, I do not come here very often.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.262
Ready?

27:12.847 --> 27:13.871
Hey.

27:14.415 --> 27:16.110
Look at all this schist.

27:16.284 --> 27:17.979
- What?
- It's a metamorphic rock.

27:18.152 --> 27:20.950
Green schist, garnet schist,
mica-garnet schist.

27:21.122 --> 27:24.580
- Oh. Schist.
- It's everywhere, look at it. I guess...

27:27.061 --> 27:28.528
Trevor.

27:35.169 --> 27:37.194
Get to the wall, Trevor.
- I can't.

27:37.372 --> 27:40.705
- I can't, the walls widen out down here.
- Your rope is caught on mine.

27:40.975 --> 27:43.239
You're gonna take us down.
I gotta cut you loose.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.537
What?
- Hannah, no.

27:44.712 --> 27:46.873
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.

27:47.048 --> 27:48.037
- Don't.
- Don't, don't, don't.

27:48.216 --> 27:49.342
- Uncle Trevor.
- Ah!

27:58.092 --> 28:00.617
Hey, guys, found it.

28:00.795 --> 28:02.228
The bottom's right here.

28:02.597 --> 28:06.260
Hey, Hannah, you knew that, right?

28:07.001 --> 28:08.400
Right?

28:08.803 --> 28:10.031
Hannah?

28:19.046 --> 28:22.140
Guys, what's this?

28:26.254 --> 28:28.245
Looks like
an abandoned mine tunnel to me.

28:28.423 --> 28:30.983
That's Old Bla'gils Mine.

28:31.659 --> 28:34.355
It was shut down 60 years ago
after the big disaster.

28:34.529 --> 28:35.928
Disaster?

28:36.230 --> 28:37.857
How big?

28:38.032 --> 28:39.431
Eighty-one dead.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.624
That's pretty big.

28:41.936 --> 28:42.960
Come on.

28:43.538 --> 28:45.301
Cowboy up.

28:46.808 --> 28:49.470
Hey, Trevor,
was there a mine like this in the book?

28:50.244 --> 28:52.337
No, don't think so.

28:54.182 --> 28:55.706
- Hannah?
- Yup?

28:55.883 --> 28:57.874
Can I ask you something?

28:58.052 --> 29:04.548
Do you wonder if your father
and my brother weren't wrong?

29:05.359 --> 29:08.226
Let me make something very clear
to you.

29:08.863 --> 29:10.228
I am not my father.

29:10.865 --> 29:14.301
And the world that he belonged to
has nothing to do with me.

29:14.469 --> 29:15.731
I understand, of course.

29:15.903 --> 29:18.463
I didn't mean to say that it was
or that it would be...

29:18.639 --> 29:22.370
- You know I'm still on the clock, right?
- You're still billing me?

29:22.543 --> 29:26.309
I bill you until I'm safe in my house.

29:27.915 --> 29:30.782
- Huh.
- Hannah?

29:35.223 --> 29:36.952
What's that?

29:37.258 --> 29:40.250
- This is the old generator for the mine.
- Hey, you don't want to touch that.

29:42.363 --> 29:43.762
What are you doing?

29:43.931 --> 29:46.456
There might be some
volatile compounds there, you know.

29:46.634 --> 29:49.569
- Serious generator.
- Hannah, that thing could blow up.

29:49.737 --> 29:50.795
Stop throwing switches.

29:50.972 --> 29:52.439
Don't do that. No, wait.

29:52.607 --> 29:54.097
Get away from that thing.

30:03.017 --> 30:05.417
Okay, I take it back.

30:11.192 --> 30:14.559
This is it, right? I mean, the miners,
they had to get their stuff out somewhere.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.959
Yeah.
- These tracks could lead us out.

30:17.331 --> 30:19.765
Hey, Hannah, how many miners got out?

30:20.768 --> 30:22.201
One.

30:22.670 --> 30:24.968
That's a start. I call front.

30:25.473 --> 30:26.804
What? No, no, no.

30:26.974 --> 30:28.271
Come on, don't get in there.

30:28.442 --> 30:30.273
We don't even know
if these things work.

30:30.444 --> 30:31.468
They're not safe.

30:31.646 --> 30:33.978
The tracks might not be safe.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.752
Track ahead looks good. Get in.

30:51.799 --> 30:54.324
Hey, Sean, it doesn't look safe.
I wouldn't do that.

30:54.502 --> 30:57.665
I think I see something. It's...

30:58.139 --> 31:00.972
Please tell me it's daylight.
Otherwise, I don't wanna know.

31:01.542 --> 31:03.066
Uh...

31:03.244 --> 31:06.008
No, it's not daylight.

31:06.180 --> 31:08.410
Oh, we're in deep schist.

31:16.490 --> 31:18.458
I wish there were seat belts
on this thing.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.719
You're worried about seat belts?

31:31.539 --> 31:32.563
- Whoa!
- Ah!

31:32.740 --> 31:34.105
Watch it.

31:45.052 --> 31:47.452
- Hannah.
- I know.

31:47.622 --> 31:49.988
- Pull the brake, pull the brake.
- No, don't.

31:50.157 --> 31:51.351
We won't make it.

32:02.737 --> 32:04.534
Yeah.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.198
Hey, great job. Thanks.

32:09.744 --> 32:12.508
Guys.
- Stay put, Sean.

32:22.490 --> 32:24.515
Trevor, you okay?

32:24.692 --> 32:28.492
Hannah, your track ends.

32:29.597 --> 32:31.087
Jump in my car.

32:31.599 --> 32:32.793
What?

32:32.967 --> 32:35.094
Quick, you have to do it.

32:35.269 --> 32:37.260
- Just jump.
- I know that.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.603
Ready? Ah!

32:47.248 --> 32:49.580
Trevor, your track ends too.

32:54.321 --> 32:56.346
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

32:56.824 --> 32:59.349
Showing the proper way
to save someone's life. Come on.

32:59.527 --> 33:00.721
- Can I help?
- Okay.

33:05.232 --> 33:06.722
Ready?

33:21.315 --> 33:23.476
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

33:23.651 --> 33:25.949
Luckily, I had a soft landing.

33:29.457 --> 33:31.857
That's two you owe me now.

33:32.293 --> 33:35.456
- Who's keeping count?
- I am.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.830
That was awesome.

33:45.206 --> 33:47.834
- What happened to you guys?
- Don't ask.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.672
What's that?

33:57.451 --> 33:59.351
Where are you going? Don't go in there.

33:59.520 --> 34:02.216
What are you guys talking about?
This could be our way out.

34:04.425 --> 34:06.586
There's a hole in the wall.

34:06.761 --> 34:08.661
Guys, check it out.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.400
Rubies.

34:14.568 --> 34:16.297
Emeralds.

34:16.469 --> 34:18.062
Feldspar.

34:18.839 --> 34:21.967
Uh, guys, there's more.

34:35.054 --> 34:36.681
Diamonds.

34:37.458 --> 34:38.982
Bling.

34:42.663 --> 34:47.464
Crystals are frequently formed
and found...

34:48.335 --> 34:52.567
...in volcanic tubes.

34:59.446 --> 35:01.744
This tube could take us back up, right?

35:01.916 --> 35:03.975
- Uh-huh.
- We're not far from the surface.

35:04.151 --> 35:06.847
- Uh-uh.
- When we get out, I'm getting a Maserati.

35:07.021 --> 35:11.253
Money is not the only thing that matters,
Sean. People matter too, you know.

35:11.425 --> 35:14.861
- Something like that.
- Not if you have a Maserati.

35:17.398 --> 35:19.127
Did you guys hear that?

35:19.900 --> 35:21.265
Nobody move.

35:34.815 --> 35:36.680
Tell me that's not what I think it is.

35:40.287 --> 35:41.345
Muscovite.

35:41.722 --> 35:42.746
Muscovite.

35:42.923 --> 35:44.857
What's muscovite?

35:47.361 --> 35:50.922
- Muscovite is a thin type of rock formation.
- How thin?

35:51.098 --> 35:54.795
Well, so thin that the slightest change
in weight and pressure...

35:54.969 --> 35:57.631
...can cause it to shatter.

35:58.072 --> 36:00.063
And we're standing on a lot of it.

36:01.709 --> 36:02.733
Just stop. Stop.

36:06.614 --> 36:07.638
Okay, they're stopped.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.775
I need you to walk back
exactly the way we came from.

36:11.952 --> 36:13.146
Very, very calmly, okay?

36:14.488 --> 36:15.648
Tread lightly.

36:15.823 --> 36:17.814
Heel, toe. Doing good.

36:17.992 --> 36:20.358
Doing great. Very slowly.

36:20.527 --> 36:22.586
Good. Come on.

36:28.369 --> 36:29.563
That's it.

36:31.005 --> 36:32.131
That's great.

36:32.306 --> 36:33.603
- Really careful.
- Keep going.

36:35.476 --> 36:37.103
No!

36:50.958 --> 36:52.687
It's actually thicker than I thought.

37:07.508 --> 37:10.102
We're still falling!

37:22.723 --> 37:24.190
Trevor, what's at the bottom?

37:24.358 --> 37:26.189
Well, if what Verne wrote was right...

37:26.360 --> 37:29.056
...these tunnels could go for hundreds,
thousands of miles.

37:29.229 --> 37:30.526
Verne was not right.

37:30.698 --> 37:32.529
Trevor, finish. What's at the bottom?

37:32.700 --> 37:34.725
Most likely theory is that it just ends.

37:34.902 --> 37:38.235
Ends? Got any other theories?

37:38.405 --> 37:41.397
Well, the walls of this tunnel
could have gently eroded...

37:41.575 --> 37:43.543
...by water which still runs through it...

37:43.711 --> 37:46.805
...providing a gradual break to our fall.

37:46.981 --> 37:49.882
- Kind of like a water slide.
- Water slide.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.449
Okay, that's a theory.

37:51.618 --> 37:55.748
But wouldn't the water have formed
stalagmites pointing straight up at us?

37:55.923 --> 37:58.221
- We'll be skewered.
- That is also possible.

38:14.641 --> 38:16.108
Is that water?

38:16.276 --> 38:17.675
Yes. Water.

38:17.845 --> 38:19.540
Water slide, water slide.

38:19.713 --> 38:22.011
Here it comes. Hang on.

39:00.888 --> 39:02.947
Sean! Sean!

39:03.457 --> 39:05.891
Sean, Sean, you all right?

39:06.060 --> 39:07.857
We didn't get skewered.

39:08.028 --> 39:09.962
Make for the rocks.

39:18.705 --> 39:20.605
Where's Hannah?

39:20.774 --> 39:23.834
Hannah! Hannah!

39:38.425 --> 39:40.017
My backpack was too heavy.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.175
Thank you.

40:01.748 --> 40:03.613
So where does that put us now?

40:06.854 --> 40:08.845
Back to one.

40:12.426 --> 40:14.394
Guys, where are we?

40:14.561 --> 40:15.789
Are those stars?

40:23.103 --> 40:24.798
No.

40:24.972 --> 40:27.702
That's just the ceiling of the cave.

40:27.875 --> 40:31.402
Is it just me, or is the cave ceiling...

40:32.379 --> 40:33.971
...moving?

40:35.983 --> 40:37.644
Yeah.

40:38.118 --> 40:40.313
It does look like it...

40:40.487 --> 40:41.920
...doesn't it?

41:04.211 --> 41:06.543
They're birds.

41:08.615 --> 41:10.344
Electric birds?

41:10.517 --> 41:13.077
They look like <i>Cyanis rosopteryx.</i>

41:13.253 --> 41:17.553
Only they're bioluminescent,
like fireflies or glowworms.

41:17.724 --> 41:18.748
It's incredible.

41:30.304 --> 41:31.931
Cool.

41:32.105 --> 41:34.369
Glow... birds.

41:44.685 --> 41:46.118
Have you seen
these creatures before?

41:46.286 --> 41:48.379
Yeah, in the museum,
but they were fossilized.

41:48.555 --> 41:51.786
These things have been extinct
for over 150 million years.

42:04.404 --> 42:06.634
Where are they going?
- Hey, a tunnel.

42:07.608 --> 42:09.337
Guys, come on.

42:11.311 --> 42:13.176
Sean, wait. Wait for me.

42:40.574 --> 42:45.102
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the center of the Earth.

42:49.616 --> 42:50.640
Max was right.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.253
He was right.

42:54.788 --> 42:58.383
Max was right!

43:01.028 --> 43:02.359
Your dad was right.

43:02.863 --> 43:03.887
He was right.

43:04.831 --> 43:06.731
Hannah, your dad was right too.

43:07.968 --> 43:09.196
They both believed...

43:09.369 --> 43:12.827
...in something
that everyone told them was impossible.

43:13.006 --> 43:14.997
He was right.

43:17.311 --> 43:20.474
- What's that light up there?
- I can't tell.

43:20.647 --> 43:26.552
It must be some sort
of luminescent gas combination.

43:27.120 --> 43:28.849
I don't know.

43:29.022 --> 43:31.820
It's like a terrarium.

43:31.992 --> 43:35.223
A terrarium thousands of miles
beneath the crust of the Earth.

43:37.931 --> 43:42.493
A world within the world.

43:54.548 --> 43:59.417
"The waterfalls, which for a long time,
could be heard flowing from afar...

43:59.586 --> 44:03.283
...now cascaded along
the towering canyon walls...

44:03.457 --> 44:05.891
...streaming along the rock
with no end."

44:06.393 --> 44:08.691
I mean,
it's the same thing Liedenbrock wrote.

44:08.862 --> 44:12.889
Are we saying that Liedenbrock
the character was real?

44:13.066 --> 44:14.226
That he existed?

44:14.401 --> 44:17.928
Someone came down here.
Someone saw all this.

44:18.105 --> 44:20.972
Someone got out
and someone told Verne.

44:21.141 --> 44:22.904
Somebody got out?

44:23.076 --> 44:25.135
That's the best thing I've heard all day.

44:25.312 --> 44:27.405
Doesn't this
just completely blow your mind?

44:50.971 --> 44:53.064
My mind is blown, yes.

45:02.082 --> 45:05.142
Enormous fossilized mushrooms.

45:05.318 --> 45:08.082
Sort of like humongous fungus.

45:11.258 --> 45:13.818
- Everything in the book is real?
- Probably.

45:13.994 --> 45:16.929
- And the really dangerous parts?
- I was thinking about that too.

45:17.097 --> 45:18.394
Right.

45:20.033 --> 45:21.057
Trevor, come quick.

45:21.234 --> 45:22.531
- Sean?
- Sean?

45:47.060 --> 45:48.994
- I'm going in.
- Yeah, wait up.

45:49.796 --> 45:51.525
Hey, slow down.

45:52.265 --> 45:53.357
I'll be right there.

46:19.392 --> 46:21.622
Someone actually lived here?

46:21.795 --> 46:23.729
That somebody...

46:25.298 --> 46:27.289
...was Liedenbrock.

46:29.436 --> 46:31.301
Look at all his gear.

46:31.938 --> 46:34.202
All this, state of the art...

46:34.841 --> 46:36.832
...a century ago.

47:35.535 --> 47:37.196
Hey, Trevor.

47:37.737 --> 47:39.568
I think I found Liedenbrock's notebook.

47:42.475 --> 47:44.033
Look.

47:44.210 --> 47:48.169
Looks like on the other side of those trees
there's some sort of underground ocean.

47:48.348 --> 47:49.906
Yeah.

47:50.951 --> 47:53.283
I don't think
that's Liedenbrock's handwriting.

47:59.659 --> 48:01.593
It's my dad's.

48:03.196 --> 48:04.788
Trevor?

48:05.799 --> 48:07.699
Trevor?

48:11.605 --> 48:13.505
Can I talk to you for a minute?

48:13.673 --> 48:14.697
Out here.

48:14.874 --> 48:17.274
Can you wait here for a minute?

48:33.026 --> 48:35.927
Hey, I think I found Max.

49:12.699 --> 49:17.602
I never really got a chance to know him.

49:20.106 --> 49:23.598
I mean, I wish I did.

49:23.977 --> 49:27.879
He wrote something
and I want you to hear it.

49:30.617 --> 49:34.815
"August 14, 1997.

49:35.655 --> 49:37.714
Today was Sean's third birthday.

49:40.360 --> 49:43.693
Six weeks ago, I promised myself
I would be home in time...

49:43.863 --> 49:45.797
...to give him his first baseball glove.

49:47.300 --> 49:50.827
Now I'm worried...

49:51.604 --> 49:53.936
...that I'll never get the chance.

49:58.178 --> 50:04.310
I set out to make an incredible discovery
to share with Trevor and the world.

50:05.085 --> 50:08.452
But now, I would trade it all...

50:09.556 --> 50:12.184
...just to be able to watch you grow up...

50:12.358 --> 50:16.317
...to be the brave and caring man...

50:16.496 --> 50:19.556
...I am certain you will become.

50:23.803 --> 50:25.168
Happy birthday, Sean.

50:27.273 --> 50:28.934
I love you.

50:29.109 --> 50:30.974
Daddy."

50:46.159 --> 50:48.127
Goodbye, Max.

50:58.805 --> 51:00.636
Come on.

51:20.393 --> 51:22.122
According to Max's journal...

51:22.295 --> 51:27.756
...we're here in this giant air pocket
that's surrounded by lava.

51:27.934 --> 51:31.563
And during periods
of intense seismic activity...

51:34.274 --> 51:37.437
- Like the one we're in now.
- That's right.

51:37.977 --> 51:40.036
- the magma that surrounds us...

51:40.213 --> 51:43.376
...turns this place
into pretty much just a big oven.

51:43.550 --> 51:45.780
Was that what happened to my dad?

51:52.659 --> 51:55.355
Look, I know I'm just a kid,
but I can handle this, really.

51:55.528 --> 51:57.359
Sit down.

51:59.299 --> 52:00.994
Max was planning an escape.

52:01.167 --> 52:05.831
His notes say that temperatures down here
can easily hit 200 degrees.

52:06.005 --> 52:08.405
A human being can't survive
beyond 135.

52:08.575 --> 52:11.066
- It's already 95 degrees.
- It was 82 when we got here.

52:11.244 --> 52:13.576
- Temperature's rising quickly.
- So, what do we do?

52:13.746 --> 52:15.680
I say that we follow Max's plan.

52:17.550 --> 52:19.541
"My analysis of the original Verne text...

52:19.719 --> 52:24.179
...leads me to believe that across the ocean
due north of my current position...

52:24.357 --> 52:27.884
...is a geyser-like river which could be used
to return to the surface."

52:28.061 --> 52:30.461
So, what we have to do
is get across this ocean...

52:30.630 --> 52:34.691
...and find the geyser
and just hitch a ride topside.

52:34.868 --> 52:36.062
Topside sounds good.

52:36.236 --> 52:37.760
It's a little trickier than that.

52:37.937 --> 52:40.132
It could get so hot
that the water'll evaporate.

52:40.306 --> 52:42.001
How much time do we have?

52:42.175 --> 52:44.268
Forty-eight hours. Seventy-two, tops.

52:45.712 --> 52:47.043
Probably less.

52:47.213 --> 52:49.306
Okay, so the question is:

52:49.482 --> 52:51.848
What is the fastest way
to get across the ocean?

52:52.018 --> 52:54.646
There's no way we can get around it,
because if we hike...

52:54.821 --> 52:56.083
Oh, we don't have time.

52:56.256 --> 52:58.315
There's no time to do that.

53:01.027 --> 53:03.120
It's all in the book.

53:08.968 --> 53:10.902
Hey, you all right?

53:11.070 --> 53:12.731
What's the temperature doing?

53:12.906 --> 53:14.567
It is a hundred degrees.

53:22.415 --> 53:25.976
Eat your trilobite, Sean.
We gotta keep our strength up.

53:26.886 --> 53:28.114
Attaboy.

53:32.992 --> 53:34.357
Hey.

53:34.527 --> 53:36.995
Don't we need a center mast?

53:37.163 --> 53:39.028
No. We don't need it.

53:39.198 --> 53:41.359
The wind that we want is way up there.

53:41.534 --> 53:44.935
Thermal. It's a lot faster
than what we got down here.

53:49.108 --> 53:50.973
Good job. That should just about do it.

53:51.144 --> 53:53.305
Hey, I got something for you.

53:58.418 --> 54:00.852
What is this?
- It's a compass.

54:01.020 --> 54:02.146
It was your dad's.

54:03.122 --> 54:05.750
I remember the Christmas
that your mom gave it to him.

54:05.925 --> 54:11.329
She wanted to make sure
that he could always find a way back home.

54:12.565 --> 54:16.661
And maybe it will help you
find a way back to her.

54:22.308 --> 54:24.071
- Thanks, Trevor.
- You got it.

54:24.243 --> 54:26.074
- It means a lot to me.
- Me too.

54:28.014 --> 54:32.451
Oh, there's one thing you should know.
Down here, the polarity is reversed.

54:32.618 --> 54:34.586
I mean, north is south, south is north...

54:34.754 --> 54:37.985
...and we need to bear due north
across the sea.

54:38.424 --> 54:39.857
You mean, south.

54:40.760 --> 54:41.988
Exactly.

55:04.617 --> 55:06.585
All right, it's starting to pick up now.

55:07.387 --> 55:09.855
Okay, hold it. Hold it really steady.

55:10.023 --> 55:12.253
Good, good, good.

55:12.658 --> 55:14.717
- Good. Ready?
- Yeah.

55:14.894 --> 55:16.725
Three, two, one, go!

55:19.298 --> 55:20.424
- Yeah.
- All right.

55:20.600 --> 55:23.626
Yeah. All right.

55:27.473 --> 55:29.168
Yeah.

55:30.443 --> 55:31.808
Go, go, go.

55:33.379 --> 55:35.142
Yeah. Keep going.

55:42.722 --> 55:44.747
Whoa, we're going, we're going.

55:44.924 --> 55:46.391
Hey, well, can you wait for me?

55:46.559 --> 55:49.494
Well, get on.
- Come on, come on, let's go.

56:05.678 --> 56:07.236
He's back.

56:07.413 --> 56:09.313
Hey, little guy.

56:14.420 --> 56:16.547
Seen those clouds?

56:16.722 --> 56:18.087
Yeah.

56:18.257 --> 56:22.523
The current's pulling us in the direction
we wanna go. We should lower the kite.

56:24.664 --> 56:27.098
Can't do that.
It's a hundred and nine degrees.

56:27.266 --> 56:28.290
It's getting hotter.

56:28.468 --> 56:30.629
We need all the speed we can get.
Leave it up.

56:37.376 --> 56:38.866
It's just a little storm.

56:39.045 --> 56:41.513
Ain't no big deal.

56:48.020 --> 56:49.544
Something moving down there.

56:51.090 --> 56:52.421
Phosphorous and plankton.

56:52.592 --> 56:54.651
It's the same thing we saw
back at the beach.

56:54.827 --> 56:57.022
I don't know.
It looks kind of big for plankton.

56:57.196 --> 57:00.131
Sean, we're not at SeaWorld,
so back off a little bit.

57:00.299 --> 57:02.563
- All right?
- I think it's some sort of fish.

57:13.713 --> 57:15.010
No.

57:21.187 --> 57:22.279
They're everywhere.

57:22.455 --> 57:24.548
Sean, I told you
we'd get to the batting cage.

57:24.724 --> 57:26.055
Batter up.

57:26.826 --> 57:29.090
Okay. Let's see what you've got.

57:30.763 --> 57:33.163
Yeah. Line drive.

57:38.671 --> 57:39.763
- Sean!
- Do you hear something?

57:43.109 --> 57:44.235
- Hello?
- <i>Sean.</i>

57:44.410 --> 57:46.241
- Mom?
- <i>I think we have a bad connection.</i>

57:46.412 --> 57:48.073
Mom, I can't hear you.

57:48.247 --> 57:49.714
<i>Where are you?</i>

57:49.882 --> 57:53.215
Uncle Trevor and I, uh...

57:53.386 --> 57:55.911
...we're sort of on a fishing trip and...

57:57.123 --> 57:58.454
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

58:01.227 --> 58:02.592
Whoa, no, you don't.

58:02.762 --> 58:06.129
- Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one.
- <i>Sean?</i>

58:06.599 --> 58:09.295
- My phone.
- Sean, do you know how to switch hit?

58:10.670 --> 58:12.900
- Ready?
- Yeah.

58:13.973 --> 58:15.133
Out of the ball park.

58:15.308 --> 58:16.400
- Sean.
- Look out.

58:16.576 --> 58:17.634
I got it, I got it.

58:24.984 --> 58:26.212
Sean.
- No, no, don't.

58:26.385 --> 58:28.319
Get away from the sides.

58:33.326 --> 58:34.452
Look what they're doing.

58:34.994 --> 58:36.825
They don't want us. They want the fish.

58:36.996 --> 58:40.295
Listen up.
Sean, you take the tiller, we'll get the line.

58:40.466 --> 58:41.865
Hannah, hold the slack.

58:42.034 --> 58:43.899
Sean, you wanna take us hard starboard?

58:44.070 --> 58:45.537
What?

58:45.705 --> 58:46.797
That way.

58:50.810 --> 58:52.277
Come on.

58:53.446 --> 58:56.142
- Okay.
- Doing good.

58:57.650 --> 59:00.050
Now just let it out gently.
Let it out gently.

59:00.219 --> 59:01.379
Let it out slowly.

59:01.554 --> 59:02.919
It's working.

59:03.089 --> 59:05.614
We're pulling clear of them.

59:10.463 --> 59:11.760
You're the man, Uncle Trev.

59:11.931 --> 59:15.799
That's what I've been telling
the scientific community for years.

59:20.306 --> 59:21.603
Hannah.

59:21.774 --> 59:23.332
Let me see.

59:28.381 --> 59:29.678
The lines.

59:46.799 --> 59:48.289
Got it.
- Sean.

59:48.467 --> 59:50.492
Sean, don't do that. No, Sean.

59:50.670 --> 59:51.796
Sean!

59:53.039 --> 59:55.473
- No, Sean!
- Trevor!

59:55.641 --> 59:57.973
- Sean!
- Hang on!

59:58.144 --> 01:00:01.602
Don't let go!

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.949
No.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.480
Trevor?

01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.180
Trevor?

01:01:19.225 --> 01:01:20.988
Hello?

01:01:23.729 --> 01:01:25.390
Hello?

01:01:27.066 --> 01:01:28.761
Hey, little guy. Where are we?

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.136
Hey, do you know
where I can get some water?

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.271
I'm talking to a bird.

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:41.572
I must be losing it.

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:55.650
Sean!

01:01:58.998 --> 01:02:01.558
Sean!

01:02:05.271 --> 01:02:07.034
Wait.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.176
The wind blew him this way.

01:02:14.346 --> 01:02:16.576
We still heading north?

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:19.608
Yeah, still north.

01:02:19.785 --> 01:02:21.753
He's a smart kid. He knows the plan.

01:02:21.921 --> 01:02:24.481
I'm sure he'll be waiting by the river.

01:02:25.524 --> 01:02:27.321
Let's find that river.

01:02:32.331 --> 01:02:35.664
Hey, come on, wait up.

01:02:42.074 --> 01:02:44.008
Where'd you go?

01:02:50.716 --> 01:02:52.775
Good job.

01:02:58.224 --> 01:02:59.987
Okay.

01:03:01.193 --> 01:03:03.218
Now which way?

01:03:09.068 --> 01:03:10.330
South.

01:03:10.503 --> 01:03:11.697
That's good.

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:13.771
The river's north.

01:03:14.673 --> 01:03:16.038
Okay.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:20.778
Here, let me take that.

01:03:20.946 --> 01:03:22.937
- No, no, I'm fine.
- Come on, let me take it.

01:03:23.115 --> 01:03:25.174
- Trevor, I'm fine.
- Hannah, Hannah, I got it.

01:03:26.051 --> 01:03:28.246
Let's just stop for a second.

01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:37.890
Hey, we're gonna find him.

01:03:43.102 --> 01:03:44.296
Drink that.

01:03:45.437 --> 01:03:47.701
- Is that the last of the water?
- Yeah.

01:03:47.873 --> 01:03:49.340
We're gonna need that. Keep it.

01:03:49.508 --> 01:03:51.567
Hannah, drink it.

01:03:53.712 --> 01:03:55.339
Come on.

01:04:06.325 --> 01:04:07.758
Duck!

01:04:10.095 --> 01:04:12.086
- What the...?
- What was that?

01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:17.101
Large carnivorous plant?

01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:18.930
Hannah.

01:04:19.705 --> 01:04:21.297
Hannah?

01:04:21.707 --> 01:04:23.334
Hannah.

01:04:23.776 --> 01:04:24.800
Hannah.

01:04:29.415 --> 01:04:31.042
Hannah.

01:04:38.924 --> 01:04:39.913
Ugh.

01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:54.434
Hang in there.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.104
That's one point for me, right?

01:05:03.282 --> 01:05:04.510
Right.

01:05:04.683 --> 01:05:07.948
Who's keeping track, right?

01:05:51.363 --> 01:05:53.160
I get it.

01:05:53.332 --> 01:05:55.459
It's a magnetic field.

01:06:20.759 --> 01:06:22.192
No way.

01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:24.522
Magnetic rocks?

01:08:00.959 --> 01:08:04.156
No, no. No, no, no.

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:24.843
No. No.

01:08:51.109 --> 01:08:53.634
You try that without wings.

01:09:07.593 --> 01:09:08.957
That's the river.

01:09:09.127 --> 01:09:11.788
Geyser must be inside that cave.

01:09:13.465 --> 01:09:17.993
Sean!

01:09:27.613 --> 01:09:28.978
Where is he?

01:09:29.381 --> 01:09:31.645
Where is he?

01:09:48.634 --> 01:09:50.499
Trevor?

01:09:54.973 --> 01:09:55.997
Trevor?

01:10:19.598 --> 01:10:24.365
Man, I really wish I'd read that book.

01:10:57.102 --> 01:10:58.660
I don't see him anywhere.

01:11:08.113 --> 01:11:09.808
Trevor? Trevor.

01:11:09.982 --> 01:11:11.745
Hang on a minute. What are you doing?

01:11:12.084 --> 01:11:13.984
I'm going to get my nephew.

01:11:15.887 --> 01:11:17.411
Hannah.

01:11:17.923 --> 01:11:22.257
This is all my fault.

01:11:22.828 --> 01:11:24.489
Save yourself.

01:11:25.063 --> 01:11:26.860
Just go home.

01:11:27.632 --> 01:11:30.066
I'll wait for you at the river...

01:11:30.235 --> 01:11:32.726
...for as long as I can.

01:11:39.878 --> 01:11:41.243
What did you do that for?

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:46.510
Just in case.

01:12:56.354 --> 01:12:58.822
Sean!

01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:01.185
Sean!

01:13:19.878 --> 01:13:21.743
Sean!

01:13:23.281 --> 01:13:24.942
Sean?!

01:13:26.284 --> 01:13:27.842
Sean!

01:13:30.388 --> 01:13:31.719
Sean!

01:13:34.059 --> 01:13:35.686
Sean! Sean!

01:13:57.382 --> 01:13:58.815
Come on!

01:14:02.621 --> 01:14:03.952
Oh, God, I'm glad to see you.

01:14:04.122 --> 01:14:05.146
Yeah, you too.

01:14:05.323 --> 01:14:07.416
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:14:07.592 --> 01:14:08.786
We should go.

01:14:10.162 --> 01:14:11.493
Wait, wait, wait.

01:14:11.663 --> 01:14:14.632
- Is that the geyser?
- Yeah, that's where we're going.

01:14:16.501 --> 01:14:18.196
Come on.

01:14:19.437 --> 01:14:23.032
- Haven't you ever seen a dinosaur before?
- Not with skin on it.

01:14:29.047 --> 01:14:31.948
He's too fast. We're not gonna make it.

01:14:36.922 --> 01:14:39.152
- Trevor, what are you doing?
- That's muscovite.

01:14:39.324 --> 01:14:41.417
Same thing that we fell through before.

01:14:41.593 --> 01:14:43.424
There's no way it's gonna hold you.

01:14:43.595 --> 01:14:45.893
It can't hold him either. Now you run.

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:48.032
Trevor, no.

01:14:50.735 --> 01:14:52.896
It's not breaking, Trevor.

01:14:53.071 --> 01:14:55.062
Keep running!

01:14:58.610 --> 01:15:00.043
- He's gaining on you.
- I know.

01:15:00.212 --> 01:15:02.271
Keep going.

01:15:03.315 --> 01:15:05.215
Ah! Whoa.

01:15:06.751 --> 01:15:09.015
Trevor, it's working.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.060
Look out!

01:15:27.372 --> 01:15:28.805
Trevor!

01:15:35.113 --> 01:15:37.946
I just remembered something.
I hate field work.

01:15:39.117 --> 01:15:40.277
Trevor, come on.

01:15:43.688 --> 01:15:45.588
That was like... And then you were like...

01:15:45.757 --> 01:15:47.987
Yeah, I know. I'm really lucky.

01:15:48.159 --> 01:15:49.854
Okay, that way.

01:15:50.028 --> 01:15:53.486
That, no good. That, worse.

01:15:53.665 --> 01:15:55.292
Let's go.

01:16:02.774 --> 01:16:05.675
The river.
How are we gonna get to the geyser?

01:16:05.844 --> 01:16:08.108
- Water's boiling.
- We need something that floats.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.872
Anything. I could use a log or...

01:16:10.048 --> 01:16:12.243
What we really need is a boat.

01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:26.190
Who had dibs again?

01:16:29.367 --> 01:16:30.391
Come on, jump in.

01:16:30.568 --> 01:16:33.731
- The best mountain guide on the planet.
- Got that right.

01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:39.333
You didn't really think
you were gonna scare me away, did you?

01:16:39.811 --> 01:16:42.143
You'll have to work harder than that.

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:54.881
I'm afraid I'll have to charge you extra
for this bit.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.255
Can I open a tab? Whoa.

01:16:58.830 --> 01:17:00.388
What was that?

01:17:01.132 --> 01:17:03.896
It's not good. That's the river bed.

01:17:04.069 --> 01:17:05.866
We're running out of water.

01:17:07.439 --> 01:17:09.737
Well, guys,
you might wanna hang on to something.

01:17:09.908 --> 01:17:13.207
This ride is about to get a little bit...

01:17:21.486 --> 01:17:23.181
Bumpy.

01:17:26.624 --> 01:17:28.285
- Is everybody all right?
- Yeah.

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:30.360
Where are we?

01:17:32.163 --> 01:17:34.324
What's that light down there?

01:17:34.632 --> 01:17:36.099
That's lava.

01:17:36.401 --> 01:17:39.268
It's magma, and it's rising.

01:17:39.437 --> 01:17:42.668
There's supposed to be water in this tunnel.
Steam, water shooting up.

01:17:42.841 --> 01:17:45.139
We're too late for the geyser,
we missed it.

01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:47.904
- What do we do?
- Do you have any suggestions, professor?

01:17:48.079 --> 01:17:51.105
Without water, no steam.
Without steam, we're not going anywhere.

01:17:51.282 --> 01:17:54.877
This place looks like there hasn't been
water here in two, three hours now.

01:17:55.053 --> 01:17:58.113
- But the walls are still wet.
- That's impossible, it's 130 degrees.

01:17:58.289 --> 01:17:59.722
- Trevor. Behind you.
- What?

01:18:02.527 --> 01:18:04.119
It is wet.

01:18:04.596 --> 01:18:07.121
It's cold. There's water behind here.

01:18:07.298 --> 01:18:10.199
There's gotta be water behind some pocket
or underground river.

01:18:10.368 --> 01:18:11.665
Trevor, it's getting closer.

01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:15.462
Hey, that's magnesium.

01:18:18.743 --> 01:18:20.904
- We're slipping.
- How many flares you got left?

01:18:26.117 --> 01:18:27.846
Three.
What do you wanna do with them?

01:18:28.019 --> 01:18:29.850
Gonna light the magnesium. On purpose.

01:18:31.823 --> 01:18:33.415
Hang on.

01:18:37.529 --> 01:18:39.793
Oh, come on. It's too wet.

01:18:44.335 --> 01:18:46.633
Got to get further down.
Give me another one.

01:18:48.606 --> 01:18:50.369
Hold my legs.

01:18:55.146 --> 01:18:56.704
Come on.

01:19:01.519 --> 01:19:04.386
You're gonna have to tie me off.
I gotta get down lower.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:06.085
Trevor, it's getting closer.

01:19:07.659 --> 01:19:09.354
That's good. All right, ready.

01:19:13.131 --> 01:19:14.826
It's the last one.

01:19:31.316 --> 01:19:32.749
Trevor, be careful.

01:19:36.321 --> 01:19:37.879
How's that?
- Little more.

01:19:38.056 --> 01:19:39.580
Hurry.

01:19:43.328 --> 01:19:45.523
Lower?
- Little more.

01:19:46.164 --> 01:19:47.324
Okay, hold off.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.661
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:19:50.835 --> 01:19:52.826
Come on, light.
- Come on.

01:19:54.739 --> 01:19:55.763
Come on, Trevor.

01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:58.306
Still wet. Gonna have to
throw it to the other side.

01:20:17.562 --> 01:20:18.995
What?

01:20:19.464 --> 01:20:20.556
No.

01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:22.290
No!

01:20:27.805 --> 01:20:29.534
Trevor, come on.

01:20:30.008 --> 01:20:31.805
- Trevor, come on.
- It's lit, it's lit.

01:20:31.976 --> 01:20:33.204
Pull!

01:20:33.545 --> 01:20:34.773
- Pull me up.
- Hurry.

01:20:34.946 --> 01:20:36.106
Pull me up. Pull me up.

01:20:37.515 --> 01:20:39.244
Come on, pull it. Pull it.
- Pull.

01:20:39.417 --> 01:20:42.079
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.

01:20:42.253 --> 01:20:44.244
Sean! Come on!

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:45.650
Get down, it's gonna blow.

01:20:58.236 --> 01:20:59.464
This thing's heating up.

01:20:59.637 --> 01:21:01.229
I know!

01:21:09.514 --> 01:21:12.483
- Hang on!
- Trust me, I'm hanging on!

01:21:14.686 --> 01:21:16.950
Is that sky?

01:21:30.501 --> 01:21:32.366
Hang on, everybody!

01:21:32.537 --> 01:21:34.937
- Stop saying that!
- It just keeps coming up!

01:22:25.523 --> 01:22:26.990
That's Mount Vesuvius.

01:22:27.458 --> 01:22:30.894
Hey, Sean, if your mom asks you
what you did this weekend...

01:22:31.062 --> 01:22:35.055
...you tell her Uncle Trevor took you to Italy.
- Italy?

01:22:53.117 --> 01:22:54.209
Sean?

01:22:54.385 --> 01:22:55.409
Sean?

01:22:57.655 --> 01:22:59.714
What? I just took
a few geological samples.

01:22:59.891 --> 01:23:01.449
A few geological samples?

01:23:01.626 --> 01:23:05.084
A few pounds of samples, but what
do you expect? I'm a scientist's son.

01:23:07.432 --> 01:23:09.559
Look. Look.

01:23:09.734 --> 01:23:12.259
You take this.

01:23:12.437 --> 01:23:15.600
You take. We are sorry.

01:23:21.846 --> 01:23:24.713
You want slide again?

01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:27.379
Slide is okay. It's fine.

01:23:27.552 --> 01:23:29.816
Anything what you want.

01:23:38.963 --> 01:23:40.590
What was that for?

01:23:40.765 --> 01:23:42.790
Now we're even.

01:23:56.314 --> 01:23:59.181
Leonard, I'm back.
Stop doing what you're doing.

01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:01.284
What am I doing?

01:24:01.452 --> 01:24:03.249
Oh, look, you're looking for work.

01:24:03.421 --> 01:24:05.616
You don't need to,
because you have a job...

01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:09.419
...with the Ásgeirsson-Anderson Institute
for Tectonophysical Exploration.

01:24:09.594 --> 01:24:11.926
The Ásgeirsson-Anderson... What?

01:24:12.096 --> 01:24:13.586
Still working on the name.

01:24:13.765 --> 01:24:16.199
But the point is, rising tide lifts all boats.

01:24:16.367 --> 01:24:17.994
Man, that's awesome.

01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:20.330
I think... Am I a boat?

01:24:20.505 --> 01:24:23.406
- You're a boat. We're back in business.
- All right, dude.

01:24:23.574 --> 01:24:26.099
Well, well, well.
What's all the excitement about?

01:24:26.277 --> 01:24:27.938
- Oh, hey, Alan. How are you?
- Good.

01:24:28.112 --> 01:24:29.704
- What you doing?
- Oh, me?

01:24:29.881 --> 01:24:32.372
I'm moving into my new lab.

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:34.513
More importantly, where have you been?

01:24:34.685 --> 01:24:38.519
I heard you missed your Monday lecture
and both of your students complained.

01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:39.678
Oh!

01:24:41.025 --> 01:24:43.425
I took a quick vacation.
Best thing I could've done.

01:24:43.594 --> 01:24:44.652
That is exciting.

01:24:44.829 --> 01:24:47.093
You'll have to promise
to tell me about it, okay?

01:24:47.265 --> 01:24:51.429
Not sure if I'll have time, but you can read
about it in <i>Scientific American.</i>

01:24:53.971 --> 01:24:55.063
<i>Scientific American?</i>

01:24:55.239 --> 01:24:57.764
Look, I just want to say,
no hard feelings, okay?

01:24:57.942 --> 01:25:00.308
About the laboratory moving
and expansion thing.

01:25:00.478 --> 01:25:02.969
So I'm actually looking
for my own building anyway.

01:25:03.147 --> 01:25:05.980
How exactly
are you going to do that, Trevor?

01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:09.217
Well, let's just say
I fell into a small fortune.

01:25:11.956 --> 01:25:13.981
So tomorrow
you're gonna be a Canadian.

01:25:14.158 --> 01:25:16.456
Yep. Looks that way.

01:25:21.532 --> 01:25:25.229
I'd say that was a lot of male bonding
packed into very little time.

01:25:25.403 --> 01:25:28.770
What do you say
we take a couple weeks next time?

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.407
A couple weeks?

01:25:30.575 --> 01:25:33.043
- What are you doing over Christmas break?
- Nothing. I'm free.

01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:35.338
I just found this in your dad's stuff.

01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:37.374
Give it a read.

01:25:37.548 --> 01:25:39.539
- <i>"Lost City of Atlantis."</i>
- Mm-hm.

01:25:39.717 --> 01:25:41.275
We'll talk.

01:25:44.355 --> 01:25:45.447
Sean, what is that?

01:25:46.157 --> 01:25:48.250
- I'm just feeding my pet.
- What pet?

01:25:48.426 --> 01:25:50.394
Sean.

01:25:50.695 --> 01:25:53.186
- You think my mom will let me keep him?
- I don't know.

01:25:53.364 --> 01:25:55.457
Might not even stay here.

01:25:55.633 --> 01:25:57.430
- Look at it.
- Hey, come on.

01:25:57.602 --> 01:25:59.797
- This is your problem.
- Where are you going?

01:26:00.271 --> 01:26:03.007
I got some food for you. Come on.
Come back down here.

01:26:03.274 --> 01:26:04.866
Come on.

01:32:30.961 --> 01:32:32.952
