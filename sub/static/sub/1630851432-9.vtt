WEBVTT

00:28.570 --> 00:31.364
Tonight's the moon
we've been waiting for this whole time,

00:31.448 --> 00:33.033
and when it hits here…

00:33.616 --> 00:38.204
Then the amulet gives us
the powers to take over the town

00:38.288 --> 00:42.000
and take every morsel of kindness in it.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.252
-Exactly!
-Yes.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.922
-Yes!

00:50.049 --> 00:55.555
Oh, Witch's Moon on me they shine!

00:55.638 --> 00:57.348
Let go, you're hurting me!

00:57.432 --> 01:02.103
Give us power to take what's mine!

01:04.481 --> 01:05.690
Oh, that was fun.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.818
-Come here, nephew!
-Let me go!

01:10.528 --> 01:11.821
You may win today,

01:11.905 --> 01:14.616
but there will always be
good witches to stop you.

01:14.699 --> 01:17.535
-Okay, yeah.

01:17.619 --> 01:21.498
The days of the Winding Way's
good witches are over.

01:21.581 --> 01:26.878
You, my friend, are the last of
a soon-to-be-extinct breed.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.982
Don't go anywhere, you three.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.610
Oh, I forgot. You can't.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.362
Wyatt, you're staying here.

01:52.445 --> 01:56.157
I don't want
our victory snacks getting away.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.575
-Snacks?
-Mm.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.953
Wait, you're gonna eat us?

02:00.537 --> 02:02.163
Don't be disgusting.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.999
Obviously, we're going to
turn you into slugs first.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.710
You're not really gonna eat them, are you?

02:09.379 --> 02:11.005
-You should listen to him.
-Yeah!

02:11.089 --> 02:13.341
Quiet, you slimy slug!

02:13.424 --> 02:17.387
You guys said I could be a warlock
and use my magic to make me popular.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.681
Now all I've made is a big mess.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.560
Well, it's about to get
a lot worse, mister.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.603
Wilma, do something.

02:26.437 --> 02:30.441
What's slimier than a slug?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.278
-No! Wait, no!

02:34.737 --> 02:35.655
Ew!

02:35.738 --> 02:37.824
-Bleh!

02:37.907 --> 02:38.950
Wyatt!

02:39.033 --> 02:43.163
Aunt Wilma, Aunt Wanda,
you can't just leave me like this.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.289
We're family.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.708
Evil has no family.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.002
-You won't get away with this!

02:49.085 --> 02:51.212
Dearie, we already have.

02:52.130 --> 02:56.801
From now on, there'll only be tricks.
No more treats, ever.

03:06.144 --> 03:10.607
Oh, this is good.
Nighty night, Winding Way.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.621
Now what?

04:09.582 --> 04:12.001
-Never fear, Fink is here.

04:12.919 --> 04:13.753
Fink!

04:13.836 --> 04:16.547
Looks like you three
could use a little hiding potion.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.550
Don't worry, Willa. I got you covered.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.719
You know,

04:21.803 --> 04:24.222
never hurts to have a rat on your side.

04:25.890 --> 04:26.724
Yes!

04:35.275 --> 04:36.401
Nice job, Fink.

04:36.484 --> 04:39.821
Those witches
always underestimated me.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.698
Hurry up, girls. Come on.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.952
Okay, being a cat so has its advantages.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.912
Like jailbreaking.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.831
We have to get to the Howl.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.249
Hey, wisters!

04:52.041 --> 04:56.296
I don't want to be a toad.
W-What if an owl gets me?

04:56.379 --> 04:57.839
I know he's been a jerk,

04:58.589 --> 05:00.091
but we can't leave him like this.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.552
I can. I totally can.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.636
Lucy!

05:04.220 --> 05:05.096
He's a toad.

05:05.179 --> 05:06.806
Better than what he was before.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.767
Please, I'll do anything. I can help.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.561
Good witches forgive.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.939
I think I have an idea.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.443
I mean,
we've all read the fairy tales, right?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.653
You're not actually gonna…?

05:20.737 --> 05:21.946
Gonna what?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.407
She doesn't mean she's gonna k--

05:24.490 --> 05:26.826
No. Scout, no.

05:26.909 --> 05:30.079
I'll take one for the team,
on one condition.

05:30.621 --> 05:35.460
No one never, ever
breathes a word about this.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.795
On the wisters.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.465
Wisters!

05:42.133 --> 05:44.052
You? Deal.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.680
Nothing. No one. Ever.

05:47.764 --> 05:52.727
Oh, trust me,
I am not going to tell anyone about this.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.482
-Ew!

06:01.110 --> 06:02.987
That actually worked?

06:03.071 --> 06:04.906
-It didn't exactly work.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.825
Doesn't the fairy tale say
he'll turn into a Prince Charming?

06:10.036 --> 06:12.747
You know they're going to
destroy our town, right?

06:12.830 --> 06:15.291
Which is why
we're on our way to stop them,

06:15.374 --> 06:17.376
and it's why you're going to help us.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.962
I guess you did save me from being a toad.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.840
We don't talk about that.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.258
Right. Sorry.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.301
Get the brooms.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.017
It's a ghost town.

06:33.101 --> 06:36.270
And not in a good way
where everyone's dead.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.816
-Look at those witch costumes. Amazing!

06:39.899 --> 06:41.234
I love Halloween!

06:41.317 --> 06:42.777
Oh, I love Halloween!

06:42.860 --> 06:44.612
Blah blah blah blah blah!

06:44.695 --> 06:46.489
Love, shmove.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.995
Yuck, I hate Halloween.
Those costumes are dumb.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.790
Your witch wish is my command.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.669
Ah, now that's more like it.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.047
Now, tell us where everybody is.

07:03.131 --> 07:05.925
At the stupid Halloween Howl. Duh.

07:06.509 --> 07:10.388
They're where we want them:
all in one place.

07:11.430 --> 07:15.643
You. You. Trash this town.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.229
I live to serve you, evil witches.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.566
Good work!

07:21.649 --> 07:23.943
-Wanda!

07:24.026 --> 07:25.111
Wilma!

07:25.194 --> 07:26.112
Wait!

07:28.948 --> 07:30.491
Bad news.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.786
We figured out where
everything in the candy store went.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.998
They've set a trap at the Howl.

07:37.498 --> 07:41.627
They have cotton candy balloons,
and candy cannons ready to launch.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.129
Don't you worry.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.466
We know exactly what to do.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.675
We do?

07:50.761 --> 07:52.889
We don't have much time left.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.056
What are we gonna do?

07:54.765 --> 07:55.600
The moon!

07:55.683 --> 07:57.477
It's getting redder!

07:58.519 --> 07:59.645
That's not good.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.190
We have to talk to my grandma.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.611
I don't think now is the time
to be going to our grannies.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.077
-Wait.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.289
What?

08:24.795 --> 08:26.464
You've never had hiding potion?

08:26.547 --> 08:28.841
Come on, take a sip and follow us.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.051
Uh…

08:30.134 --> 08:32.345
They really didn't
teach you anything, did they?

08:37.683 --> 08:40.019
-Woohoo!

08:40.937 --> 08:43.523
Oh, this is so cool!

08:43.606 --> 08:45.566
Here goes nothing. Whoa!

08:47.401 --> 08:49.987
-Whee!

08:50.071 --> 08:52.073
Whoa! Oh man!

08:52.907 --> 08:54.784
Grandma, it's Willa!

08:55.993 --> 08:57.078
Grandma?

08:57.620 --> 09:00.581
Wow. What is this place?

09:00.665 --> 09:03.000
Oh, Willa. We saw the moon.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.877
What happened out there?

09:05.461 --> 09:08.047
Pete, Snout, we need my grandma.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.591
I see you've brought a warlock with you.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.884
How did you know that?

09:11.968 --> 09:16.764
The potion turns witches into cats,
and warlocks to dogs.

09:16.847 --> 09:17.723
Interesting.

09:18.307 --> 09:21.060
Uh, but right now,
I really need to talk to Grandma.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.104
She's in the lessons room.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.440
-Come on.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.283
Return the forms that we came from!

09:42.373 --> 09:43.249
Grandma!

09:44.333 --> 09:45.209
Hello, Wyatt.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.211
Have we met?

09:47.795 --> 09:50.506
I knew your grandfather Warwick well.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.092
He was the greatest warlock of his time.

09:53.634 --> 09:54.719
Handsome.

09:54.802 --> 09:56.971
-Like you.

09:57.054 --> 09:57.888
Wow.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.601
Do I need glasses or something?

10:06.147 --> 10:07.732
We don't know what to do.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.528
You left here three good witches,
and you came back with a fourth teammate.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.822
That seems like
good work to me.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.491
I wouldn't totally say
this guy's a teammate yet,

10:17.575 --> 10:20.745
or a good one for that matter.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.247
I'm literally standing right here.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.000
The witches have already taken the amulet.

10:26.667 --> 10:31.297
And they transformed
the amulet into something so evil.

10:31.922 --> 10:35.676
Willa, you are just like your mother
in so many ways.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.012
She made her own mistakes.

10:38.095 --> 10:41.307
You can't let the light in
without any cracks.

10:41.390 --> 10:44.143
So, zero help then.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.937
"Carry on. Hope you win. Good luck!"

10:47.021 --> 10:48.439
Can you help us, Grandma?

10:48.522 --> 10:52.610
I wish, but I am
no longer of this earthly plane.

10:53.527 --> 10:54.987
What does that even mean?

10:57.865 --> 10:59.116
Oh!

11:01.535 --> 11:06.540
Do you really believe that their evil
stands a chance against your goodness?

11:06.624 --> 11:11.212
You have beaten them
over and over and over.

11:11.295 --> 11:16.217
You must believe in
the magic of a young girl's heart.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.512
Your heart.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.556
I know exactly what you mean.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.267
You do?

11:25.351 --> 11:28.604
We're going to take back that amulet. Now.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.023
You don't have much time.

11:44.286 --> 11:47.164
We're almost there. Just up ahead!

11:47.248 --> 11:49.917
Yay! Wait, what are those?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.461
They look like
cotton candy balloons.

11:52.545 --> 11:56.090
Oh, nice try, Normal Neil,
but before you can blink your normal eyes,

11:56.173 --> 11:58.259
we'll have you all
under a spell of darkness.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.310
Incoming witches!

12:10.271 --> 12:11.480
Wait for my signal!

12:11.564 --> 12:12.648
Okay.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.483
Guide us in, Claw.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.154
Ready…

12:20.364 --> 12:21.407
Aim…

12:22.908 --> 12:25.202
Look out! Look out!

12:25.286 --> 12:26.203
Fire!

12:40.926 --> 12:42.470
-Incoming!
-Hold…

12:42.553 --> 12:45.347
Ready, aim, fire!

12:48.893 --> 12:51.979
Oh, so close! Not good enough!

12:53.355 --> 12:55.441
Hold still, sister. Oh-ho!

12:59.236 --> 13:02.114
We're the witches of Winding Way,

13:02.198 --> 13:05.201
and we rule this town!

13:05.701 --> 13:06.994
Oh ho ho!

13:09.788 --> 13:13.709
Oh, ho ho ho.
Well if it isn't Normal Neil.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.628
I knew you were up to something.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.171
Fire!

13:20.508 --> 13:21.383
Stop it!

13:21.467 --> 13:24.595
What is wrong with you people?!

13:24.678 --> 13:29.225
You're gonna have to use a lot more
than candy to stop these witches.

13:29.308 --> 13:35.814
I am so tired of you
and all your normalness!

13:35.898 --> 13:37.316
Actually, it's "normalcy."

13:38.609 --> 13:39.693
Sorry, force of habit.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.571
-I'm an English teacher so it's just--
-Seriously?!

13:50.871 --> 13:53.791
We won't be needing
these pesky outfits anymore.

13:56.043 --> 14:01.674
Wowzer! Brava! Great show!

14:01.757 --> 14:03.425
Best party ever.

14:03.509 --> 14:07.346
You liked that, did you?
Well, that was just the opening act.

14:07.429 --> 14:09.348
Mm-hm. It sure was. Second act?

14:09.431 --> 14:11.976
Oh, us just ruling this town!

14:14.562 --> 14:17.565
-Whoa!

14:27.783 --> 14:29.368
This is fun!

14:45.718 --> 14:48.262
Everybody stay back from the bad witches!

14:48.345 --> 14:49.889
We're here to stop 'em!

14:50.389 --> 14:53.267
Girls, girls, girls.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.727
And Wyatt?

14:54.810 --> 14:57.146
I can't believe you'd betray us like this.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.522
You turned me into a toad!

14:59.273 --> 15:01.525
Oh, right, that.
Yeah, that was pretty nasty.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.904
Give up! You can't take us all on.

15:05.779 --> 15:06.739
We don't need to.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.157
They will!

15:13.287 --> 15:16.624
Happy Halloween, Winding Way!

15:19.835 --> 15:20.669
Willa!

15:20.753 --> 15:23.589
You are in big trouble, young lady.

15:23.672 --> 15:24.965
Dad?!

15:25.049 --> 15:27.801
Oh, no. They got you?

15:27.885 --> 15:30.721
You are grounded forever!

15:30.804 --> 15:32.556
Dad, stop!

15:32.640 --> 15:33.891
You're under a curse!

15:33.974 --> 15:37.269
How about a lifetime of detention
for all you kids?

15:37.353 --> 15:40.105
That'll knock the happy right outta you.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.149
Ms. Juniper, get a grip!

15:42.232 --> 15:46.946
Ms. Juniper, it's me.
Lucy. Your favorite student.

15:47.029 --> 15:50.324
What?! I thought
I was her favorite student.

15:50.908 --> 15:54.328
Willa, this amulet belongs to us.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.497
We stole it, fair and square!

15:56.580 --> 15:57.748
That's true.

15:57.831 --> 16:01.794
Look around you!
It's almost midnight.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.505
This town will be ours!

16:04.588 --> 16:06.465
It's not over yet.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.676
Remember what my grandma said.

16:08.759 --> 16:12.554
If you believe in magic,
the spell will come from within.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.431
But they have the amulet.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.767
We need it to turn everyone back.

16:16.850 --> 16:17.851
Or…

16:18.602 --> 16:20.729
-The power's within us.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.439
It's in our hearts.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.608
Just trust me.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.195
Wyatt, go up to the DJ booth and play…

16:29.613 --> 16:30.447
Okay.

16:31.407 --> 16:35.369
Let's show the bad witches
how good witches party.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.093
What the--

16:51.176 --> 16:52.052
What are you doing?

16:52.136 --> 16:54.096
This isn't the time for a dance party.

16:54.179 --> 16:58.017
Good witches know most problems
can be solved by dancing. Come on!

16:58.809 --> 17:00.853
The joy will overpower the darkness!

17:00.936 --> 17:01.937
Seriously?

17:12.072 --> 17:14.408
No more tricks, Willa Ward!

17:16.493 --> 17:19.038
You think a little dancing
is gonna take us down?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.210
No! We'll put a stop to this!

17:25.294 --> 17:26.462
Oh!

17:28.338 --> 17:30.382
I should've gotten you
when you were a baby!

17:32.968 --> 17:35.929
You can't dance, Willa Ward!

17:36.013 --> 17:37.639
-No!

17:38.682 --> 17:41.018
-The amulet!

17:50.152 --> 17:52.780
It's like we're in Kansas with Toto!

17:52.863 --> 17:55.032
Oh, you'll pay for this!

18:02.748 --> 18:05.334
-You haven't seen the last of us!

18:05.417 --> 18:06.835
We'll be waiting!

18:06.919 --> 18:08.712
Run away!

18:08.796 --> 18:10.089
Let's get outta here!

18:15.219 --> 18:18.097
-We still have to fix all of them.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.934
We're running out of time! They said
the curse becomes permanent at midnight.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.361
Return the form that they came from!

18:37.699 --> 18:39.701
That's not working! What do we do?

18:40.452 --> 18:42.371
-Guys.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.042
If we break it,
we break the curse.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.711
No, you can't! It was your mom's.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.297
I don't need this amulet
to have her with me.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.801
-She's always with me.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.387
It's what a good witch does.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.140
It's what my mom would do.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.331
-Willa!

19:26.999 --> 19:27.833
Mom?

19:30.085 --> 19:30.919
Mom!

19:38.969 --> 19:40.762
My beautiful baby girl.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.347
Look at you.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.225
I got trapped in that amulet.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.352
Trying to save me!

19:47.936 --> 19:49.730
And now, you saved me back.

19:50.856 --> 19:51.690
Willow?

19:53.984 --> 19:55.277
Willow!

20:00.240 --> 20:02.201
-What?

20:03.493 --> 20:04.786
H-How?

20:05.370 --> 20:07.539
Wanda and Wilma's spell
locked me in the amulet.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.167
I was so relieved
when Dad finally gave me to you,

20:10.250 --> 20:13.503
even though I said she shouldn't have
the amulet until she was of age!

20:13.587 --> 20:16.256
Of age! Twelve, right?
That's what you meant?

20:16.340 --> 20:18.842
Sweetie, I was thinking more like 18?

20:22.596 --> 20:24.139
And you, Fink.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.099
I wouldn't be here without you.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.603
Thank you for taking care of Willa
when I wasn't around.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.564
Th-that's what best friends do, right?

20:33.148 --> 20:35.692
You got a pretty terrific daughter here.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.735
And, uh…

20:36.818 --> 20:38.820
Eh, Neil's okay, too.

20:40.405 --> 20:44.117
Seriously, I never thought that
I would have a talking rat as a friend.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.994
-But this guy's growing on me.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.455
Oh!

20:48.538 --> 20:50.290
This is Ms. Juniper.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.583
She's Willa's teacher,

20:51.667 --> 20:54.544
and my witch-busting co-captain.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.046
The witchstorian.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.173
Thank you for helping Willa.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.176
Can I do anything
to return the favor?

21:01.260 --> 21:05.222
You know, I have always dreamt
of casting a spell. But--

21:05.806 --> 21:08.850
-Well, have you ever really tried?
-Oh, no! No, no.

21:08.934 --> 21:12.604
No, I'm just an academic.
An amateur witchstorian.

21:12.688 --> 21:16.525
Trust me, being an amateur
is the first step to being a pro.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.238
-Here.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.407
Try this one.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.535
Oh.

21:28.578 --> 21:33.583
Loyal friend of mine
Let me hear your voice so fine

21:38.297 --> 21:40.465
Jolly good show, Ms. Juniper.

21:40.549 --> 21:44.303
I-I-I can talk! This is amazing!

21:44.386 --> 21:47.723
It is so lovely to meet you.
Squeak squeak.

21:48.890 --> 21:49.725
What?!

21:49.808 --> 21:51.476
Piggy!

21:51.560 --> 21:54.855
-I did it!

21:56.648 --> 22:00.193
Oh! Mom, these are my best friends.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.612
Scout, and Lucy.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.949
You three restored
the order of the good witches.

22:06.033 --> 22:09.036
You should be very, very proud.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.176
Since there are three of us,
and we're officially witches…

22:24.259 --> 22:27.262
We are the new witches of Winding Way!

22:27.346 --> 22:29.639
Do you think anyone
will write a legend about us?

22:29.723 --> 22:33.810
If they make a movie, they better
pick someone with great hair to play me.

22:33.894 --> 22:37.230
I can't wait to see
what evil witches we fight next.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.402
-Too soon?

22:43.779 --> 22:45.989
One more time?

22:46.073 --> 22:46.907
Obvi!

22:47.783 --> 22:50.786
I know I cried a lot,
but being a cat is the best!

22:54.581 --> 22:56.458
The wisters!
