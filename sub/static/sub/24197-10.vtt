HAD A HUGE PENIS AND I WAS GREAT

10:56.233 --> 10:57.300
AT SPORTS.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.533

10:59.533 --> 11:00.700
PEOPLE YOU WERE BLACK, THEY

11:00.700 --> 11:02.900
WOULD GET A REACTION BECAUSE

11:02.900 --> 11:04.500

THIS PERSON IS NOT BLACK.

19:38.667 --> 19:41.100
ADS FROM UBER, FACEBOOK, WELLS

19:41.100 --> 19:47.133
FARGO WHERE THEY'RE AFOLPOLOGIZING

FOR SELLING YOUR PERSONAL

19:47.867 --> 19:48.300

DURING MY TIME ON AIR, I'VE

20:28.600 --> 20:30.700
IGNORED THE BOUNDARIES OF GOOD

20:30.700 --> 20:33.800
TASTE AND TOO OFF AIMED FOR THE

20:33.800 --> 20:35.567
LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATORS.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.433
I'VE MADE HURTFUL REMARKS, AND

20:38.433 --> 20:40.133
ALL THE GAY JOKES, COMBINED WITH

20:40.133 --> 20:42.033
POOR ACTING AND LAZY WRITING

20:42.033 --> 20:42.800
WERE THE NORM.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.633
WE'VE NEVER EVOLVED, EVEN AS THE

20:44.633 --> 20:46.233
WORLD HAS CHANGED AROUND US.

20:46.233 --> 20:49.533
AND FOR THAT, I AM TRULY SORRY,

20:49.533 --> 20:50.133
NOT SORRY.

20:50.133 --> 20:51.400
IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM MY

20:51.400 --> 20:54.100
MISTAKES, IT'S GO DOWN GUNS

20:54.100 --> 20:57.133
BLAZING, TWO FINGERS UP, I DON'T

20:57.133 --> 20:58.433
GIVE A [ BLEEP ].

20:58.433 --> 20:59.433
I'M DOUBLING DOWN.

20:59.433 --> 21:02.067
I'LL DO THE SHOW OUT OF SPITE,

21:02.067 --> 21:07.300
YOU PUSSIES.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.467
TIME TO GET ON MY CYCLE AND RIDE

21:09.467 --> 21:10.900
OFF INTO THE SUNSET.

21:10.900 --> 21:11.467
GOOD NIGHT.

21:11.467 --> 21:12.100
HAVE A GREAT SUMMER.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.633
SEE YOU IN SEPTEMBER.

21:14.833 --> 21:15.300
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

21:46.100 --> 21:47.867
>>> HOW DOES THE BLACK COMMUNITY

21:47.867 --> 21:49.133
FEEL ABOUT DANIEL TOSH?

21:49.133 --> 21:50.167
>> WHO, YOU?

21:50.167 --> 21:51.333
I NEVER HEARD OF YOU.

21:51.333 --> 21:51.933
>> OKAY.

21:51.933 --> 21:53.333
