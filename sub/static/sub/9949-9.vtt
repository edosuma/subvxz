00:02.360 --> 00:06.359
Anyone watching thinking
we know fuck all about owt
needs to watch their back.

00:08.480 --> 00:12.079
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:12.127 --> 00:14.186
sending prices sky-high.

00:14.193 --> 00:18.192
Literally, literally taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:18.753 --> 00:20.912
And now you've got
your ConDemNation.

00:20.913 --> 00:24.672
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:24.673 --> 00:27.712
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:27.713 --> 00:31.712
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

00:32.033 --> 00:34.552
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:34.553 --> 00:37.992
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.993 --> 00:40.832
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:40.833 --> 00:44.192
and they charge us for water!

00:44.193 --> 00:48.192
I wandered lonely as a cloud,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:49.433 --> 00:52.592
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times.

00:52.593 --> 00:55.192
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:55.193 --> 00:59.192
It's not theirs any more.
This is our England now.

01:00.953 --> 01:03.482
Paaaarty!

01:15.153 --> 01:19.152
'My husband has killed men,
I don't know how many,

01:19.993 --> 01:22.232
'I don't know the circumstances.

01:22.233 --> 01:26.232
'I do know better than to ask.

01:27.073 --> 01:31.072
'There's a dark side to my husband,
he has secrets.

01:34.113 --> 01:36.272
'Defends what is his -

01:36.273 --> 01:40.272
'it's in his blood,
generation after generation.

01:41.193 --> 01:43.472
'Do not cross my husband lightly.

01:43.473 --> 01:47.472
'Because if he finds you,
he will exact a terrible revenge.'

01:49.537 --> 01:50.496
I'll get it.

01:50.508 --> 01:54.507
No, it's all right,
I've got it. Go back to sleep.

02:01.068 --> 02:03.747
Hello?

02:03.748 --> 02:07.227
This has to stop.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.707
You better stay in your hole,
you little fucking prick,

02:09.708 --> 02:12.187
because I'll cut your throat
from ear to fucking ear.

02:16.548 --> 02:17.947
Everything all right?

02:17.948 --> 02:21.947
Yeah. Wrong number.
Let's go back to bed.

02:28.908 --> 02:32.907
Cheers.

02:33.948 --> 02:35.147
Cheers now.

02:35.148 --> 02:37.027
South African?

02:37.176 --> 02:38.335
Yes.

02:38.336 --> 02:42.735
You are a white South African -
batons and Soweto and Steve Biko?

02:44.640 --> 02:46.519
Desmond Mandela, and the rest.

02:46.520 --> 02:50.519
My father went out after the war,
to be a policeman, for a party.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.639
Apartheid.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.119
They know how
to treat the police out there.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.639
They've got maids, gardeners,
servants, the lot.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.719
And a proper respect for the law.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.319
You must've had
a passport before now?

03:03.320 --> 03:04.919
Didn't need one.

03:04.920 --> 03:07.999
I've never been north of Bury,
or south of Stockport.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.119
These are for the Citizenship Test,
Lillian.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.999
Why would you need a Citizen...

03:13.000 --> 03:15.479
You're not a British citizen?

03:15.480 --> 03:19.479
There were a load of forms to
fill in, I couldn't be bothered.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.679
Woo, yeah!

03:23.680 --> 03:26.479
Hey, come on, pace yourself,
son, it's a Snickers, not a sprint.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.079
Come on, Frank,
I'm just getting warmed up.

03:29.080 --> 03:33.079
Eh, Senorita! Come on,
drinks all round.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.519
Oh, you beauty!

03:38.520 --> 03:41.919
Click your fingers at me again,
and you'll be tickling
your prostate with them.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.279
I do apologise.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.239
Oh, hello, are the Nursery full?

03:48.240 --> 03:52.159
I heard the slap, didn't I?
Do it again please!

03:52.160 --> 03:56.159
When we ask for a drink,
we ask with some fucking good grace.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.559
Some fucking good grace.

03:59.560 --> 04:03.559
Well, we would be most grateful
if we could have a top up, please.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.479
Better.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.959
You know what,

04:08.960 --> 04:11.719
that might've been one of the most
erotic moments of my life.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.159
I think you're confusing sex
with corporal punishment.
Schoolboy error.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.759
You know that I'm good with
the ladies, better than most.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.039
Oh, you think so, do you?

04:21.040 --> 04:23.519
Watch and learn, son.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.439
Could I interest you...

04:25.440 --> 04:28.719
Not unless you had a full head
and body transplant.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.279
Crashed and burned!

04:30.280 --> 04:34.239
Mock if you must, but I have
spread my seed plenty wide.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.279
Flying solo doesn't count, Frank.
Solo!

04:36.280 --> 04:40.279
Dominos?

04:41.040 --> 04:42.319
Anything?

04:42.320 --> 04:46.319
Just bills and stuff. Don't worry.

04:46.320 --> 04:50.319
Just got to, er...

05:09.320 --> 05:13.319
Come on, then,
you fucking coward! Eh!

05:13.720 --> 05:15.879
Shadow boxing again, eh?

05:15.880 --> 05:17.679
What are you sneaking around for?

05:17.680 --> 05:19.239
Fuck. I'm not sneaking around,

05:19.240 --> 05:23.239
I've got four pounds of fucking weed
here, do you think I'm gonna
go in through the front door!

05:24.800 --> 05:26.279
That was out of order.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.479
Pressure.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.919
Oh, apology accepted.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.719
I didn't fucking apologise.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.119
Yeah, one of these days,
I'm gonna hit back.

05:33.120 --> 05:37.039
A little alcohol,
but definitely no weed,

05:37.040 --> 05:39.239
or her larynx
will swell like a baboon's arse,

05:39.240 --> 05:42.599
then she'll be smoking
through a hole in her neck.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.399
It's for my time. It's taking
up more and more of my day.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.879
I've noticed.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.119
Meaning?

05:53.120 --> 05:55.719
Don't pick a fight just cos
you've got a guilty conscience.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.119
Her mother's
not got a pot to piss in.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.039
That lot would've cost her
Â£60 over the counter.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.639
So, you're the Great Provider -
I hear you.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.039
Yak, yak, fucking yak.

06:05.040 --> 06:08.319
Swear and wear a micro-mini -
that'll get you ahead in life.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.479
Start smoking while you're at it.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.999
I already do.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.639
I'm helping people.

06:15.640 --> 06:19.439
So what you gonna
spend your earnings on?

06:19.440 --> 06:22.439
Is that what your big book
tells you?

06:22.440 --> 06:23.879
How to be a smart arse?

06:23.880 --> 06:26.439
You've convinced yourself what
you're doing is right, haven't you?

06:26.440 --> 06:30.439
It is.

06:31.640 --> 06:32.959
You've got to ask yourself -

06:32.960 --> 06:35.399
when was the last time
you got your end away?

06:35.400 --> 06:38.479
Twice, this morning, and a blowy.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.999
Fuck!

06:40.000 --> 06:42.399
I have recently, frequently...

06:42.400 --> 06:43.479
Thought not.

06:43.480 --> 06:47.479
Don't try and out-sex me.
How many women have you poked?

06:48.720 --> 06:50.199
I haven't got a clue.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.639
A-ha.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.519
Look, the point is - him,
he's starting out,

06:54.520 --> 06:58.159
me, I'm at my prime.
You, you're a spent force.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.359
I mean pretty soon, your sex
life will be consigned to history.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.839
Like Spangles.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.999
Oh. I'm out.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.119
Got to start me shift.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.479
32. And a half.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.399
How many I've shagged.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.639
I'll be back in a couple
of hours, yeah.

07:15.640 --> 07:16.839
Everything all right?

07:16.840 --> 07:20.559
Why wouldn't it be?

07:20.560 --> 07:21.639
20 minutes, see you then.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.119
Where you off?

07:23.120 --> 07:25.439
Lock up in Gorton,
there's been a fire.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.559
Have we lost...?

07:26.560 --> 07:27.999
The lot. We've lost the lot.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.079
Who the fuck knew about Gorton?

07:30.080 --> 07:33.959
No-one. Had to give the lads a
postcode so they could Sat-Nav it.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.039
You need company?

07:36.040 --> 07:40.039
No. I'll be back as soon as.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.679
What they laughing at?

07:49.680 --> 07:51.039
Pair of dinosaurs.

07:51.040 --> 07:54.319
Take their bras off,
and their tits'll hit their knees.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.039
Wouldn't be a teenager again
for all the money in the world.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.559
Oh, I fucking would.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.879
The damage I could cause,
knowing what I know now.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.879
Sandy Alexander dropped this off.
Urine sample.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.479
Any chance of the results
by Tuesday, he says.

08:10.480 --> 08:14.039
From Patty Croker, in case
you'd forgotten the last set.

08:14.040 --> 08:17.559
Patty's been warned off every
GP's practice in North Manchester,

08:17.560 --> 08:20.559
and Sandy... I think he's diabetic.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.559
You're diagnosing people!?

08:22.560 --> 08:24.799
I'm putting tests into the system.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.359
They send off hundreds
to the lab every day.

08:27.360 --> 08:31.359
What's the point of having knowledge
if you don't apply it?

08:32.760 --> 08:36.078
What do you think of them
as a couple?

08:36.080 --> 08:37.639
She'd have him for breakfast.

08:37.640 --> 08:38.958
He's a big lad, your dad.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.399
Yeah, but she's a right dirty
scrubber... You can tell.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.399
True.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.119
Totally clear?

08:54.120 --> 08:58.119
Absolutely.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.119
Jamie?

09:04.200 --> 09:08.199
It was nailed to the door.

09:08.440 --> 09:12.439
Whose is it?

09:13.520 --> 09:14.934
My wife's.

09:28.074 --> 09:31.473
16,421 souls.

09:31.576 --> 09:33.935
That's how many I've boffed.

09:33.936 --> 09:35.755
Before or after lunch?

09:35.760 --> 09:37.619
Life-time, smart arse.

09:37.643 --> 09:41.642
It's a very precise number.
Not 16,500, 16,421.

09:42.763 --> 09:45.402
Total population of the Chatsworth,

09:45.403 --> 09:49.402
according to the Census of 2011,
as reported on "Mancapedia".

09:50.003 --> 09:52.922
You've fucked
everyone on the Chatsworth?

09:52.923 --> 09:55.082
That's one a day
since you were eight.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.762
365 times 53, your age, minus 16...

09:58.763 --> 10:00.002
Stop.

10:00.003 --> 10:04.002
Fuck off and count matchsticks
or lines on the road, you gimp.

10:04.403 --> 10:05.922
By association.

10:05.923 --> 10:08.882
Sex degrees of separation.

10:08.883 --> 10:12.602
Not a single individual on the
Chatsworth that I have not fucked,

10:12.603 --> 10:14.282
once or twice removed.

10:14.283 --> 10:15.962
That's bollocks.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.082
Yeah?

10:18.083 --> 10:21.962
I've had him.

10:21.963 --> 10:25.762
I think I would've remembered.

10:25.763 --> 10:27.322
I fucked her.
Oi!

10:27.323 --> 10:30.562
She regularly humps her hubby,
presumably. More fool him.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.522
Again? Oi!

10:33.523 --> 10:37.522
Hubby slithered out of the scally
muff of his mother,

10:38.243 --> 10:42.242
where young William frequently
deposits his juvenile jizz.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.682
Therefore, by association,
I have jizzed where he has jizzed,

10:48.323 --> 10:51.002
though I jizzed there first,
so to speak.

10:51.003 --> 10:53.202
How long's this been going on?

10:53.203 --> 10:54.642
Couple of weeks.

10:54.643 --> 10:58.042
At first I thought it was just some
numpty fancying his chances,

10:58.043 --> 11:00.682
but it's got to be a team.
They're all over us.

11:00.683 --> 11:04.682
Where we are, who we're with,
when we're in or out.

11:05.043 --> 11:06.802
I had to shred my bank cards
this morning.

11:06.803 --> 11:10.802
Someone's been in my accounts.

11:13.443 --> 11:17.042
This is the real deal, Mam.

11:17.043 --> 11:20.762
It could be coming
from any direction.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.402
Have you told Karen?

11:22.403 --> 11:23.882
She'd fucking freak.

11:23.883 --> 11:27.882
I think you'd better.
Forewarned and all that.

11:28.443 --> 11:30.522
You're going to have to smoke them
out.

11:30.523 --> 11:34.522
Find out who and then
you'll know why.

11:36.003 --> 11:40.002
My little swimmers course through
the blood-streams of all.

11:40.403 --> 11:44.402
Female or male. I am omni-gender.

11:44.683 --> 11:46.562
See, anyone can do that.

11:46.563 --> 11:50.082
Oh, yeah? Well, have a go, Rob Roy
McGregor. You'll soon hit a hurdle.

11:50.083 --> 11:54.082
I have, for example, deposited
my stuff in your little McMuff.

11:55.363 --> 11:57.642
Bullshit. And let's try
and keep it clean.

11:57.643 --> 12:01.642
I rode Angie, who fucked Colin G,

12:02.483 --> 12:06.482
who shagged Tricia Patterson,
who's the wife of young Danny,

12:07.603 --> 12:10.082
who's been dipping his wick in you
if I'm not mistaken.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.682
Though, not a lot
of people know that.

12:11.683 --> 12:13.722
Fucking married!?

12:13.723 --> 12:16.082
I am not!

12:16.083 --> 12:20.082
So, sex degrees of separation.

12:21.203 --> 12:23.242
I like it.

12:23.243 --> 12:27.242
And the beauty of it is, every time
one of these rides someone new,

12:27.603 --> 12:30.282
my tally expands.

12:30.283 --> 12:34.282
Now how's that "history"? Pint!

12:55.403 --> 12:59.402
See you.

13:04.923 --> 13:05.602
Hiya.

13:05.603 --> 13:09.602
See you, sexy.

13:11.203 --> 13:14.522
Seems unfair. I've paid
taxes all my life.

13:14.523 --> 13:15.842
No, you haven't!

13:15.843 --> 13:18.882
Not a farthing, ever! You're the one
the Daily Mail warns us about.

13:18.883 --> 13:21.842
Chocolate? Party at yours then,
is it?

13:21.843 --> 13:25.842
Got a lot of revising to do.
Lillian wants a passport.

13:26.523 --> 13:30.522
In order to get one,
she has to take a Citizenship Test.

13:30.803 --> 13:33.042
She was born abroad,
never got naturalised.

13:33.043 --> 13:34.482
Hiya.

13:34.483 --> 13:37.202
And now she's tossed her
hat in the passport ring,

13:37.203 --> 13:39.122
if she fails the test,

13:39.123 --> 13:42.082
she'll be deported for being
an illegal immigrant.

13:44.683 --> 13:48.682
C'mon, trigger.

13:50.203 --> 13:51.562
Something to say?

13:51.563 --> 13:53.762
No.

14:08.203 --> 14:12.042
Fuck.

14:12.043 --> 14:13.762
Her middle name's Finola?

14:13.763 --> 14:15.322
That's not the issue.

14:15.323 --> 14:16.362
Are you totally sure?

14:16.363 --> 14:18.722
White blood cell count
is off the scale.

14:18.723 --> 14:21.242
Red blood cell count
is in her boots.

14:21.243 --> 14:23.362
It's not a good combination, Jackson.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.882
It's not a real name,
is it, Finola?

14:25.883 --> 14:27.562
It sounds more like a pet's name.

14:27.563 --> 14:30.282
You have to tell her.
Get her to a doctor.

14:30.283 --> 14:34.242
A, you're not going to get Patty
anywhere near a doctor,

14:34.243 --> 14:36.362
and B, no way am
I telling her she's dying.

14:36.363 --> 14:37.322
Patty's dying?

14:37.323 --> 14:39.242
No!

14:39.243 --> 14:41.482
Maybe. We don't know.

14:41.483 --> 14:42.762
I've got to tell Aidan.

14:42.763 --> 14:46.762
You want to live till you're 17,
you'll say nothing.

14:48.243 --> 14:49.362
Where are you going?

14:49.363 --> 14:52.602
Town. While she's all grown up
and out trying to bag a footballer

14:52.603 --> 14:56.602
and you're playing Doctor Dolittle,
I've got a life.

14:58.603 --> 15:01.162
With great knowledge comes great
responsibility.

15:01.163 --> 15:05.162
You have to tell her.

15:11.163 --> 15:14.042
Just to get warmed up.

15:14.043 --> 15:17.842
How many Parliamentary
Constituencies are there?

15:17.843 --> 15:19.642
Seven.

15:19.643 --> 15:21.802
Close.

15:21.803 --> 15:25.282
650. But they'll probably give
multiple-choice in the test,

15:25.283 --> 15:27.482
so stick in.

15:27.483 --> 15:31.482
What is the difference
in the average hourly wage

15:31.723 --> 15:33.322
for men and women?

15:33.323 --> 15:37.282
Five, ten or 20% lower for women?

15:37.283 --> 15:39.362
Higher.

15:39.363 --> 15:41.562
No, sweetness. Lower.

15:41.563 --> 15:42.882
Higher.

15:42.883 --> 15:44.522
It's not a fucking game!

15:44.523 --> 15:48.082
I didn't get the question.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.642
Simpler one.

15:50.643 --> 15:54.162
How old was the Queen Mother
when she passed away?

15:54.163 --> 15:55.962
What?

15:55.963 --> 15:57.602
How old was the Queen Mother...

15:57.603 --> 15:59.082
The Queen Mother's not dead.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.122
Come again?

16:00.123 --> 16:03.082
She stole the show
when William married Kate.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.442
With her gin and her horses,

16:04.443 --> 16:08.442
and all the young men oiled
and sent up to her room.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.482
Except Barney.

16:37.483 --> 16:38.722
What?

16:38.723 --> 16:42.722
I've shagged everyone
on the Chatsworth except Barney.

16:43.123 --> 16:46.722
There's no connection, nothing.

16:46.723 --> 16:49.082
Ah, come on Frank.
Not like it matters.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.602
There, there, there.

16:50.603 --> 16:52.402
You can't win them all.

16:52.403 --> 16:54.482
Take them to the usual place.

16:54.483 --> 16:56.402
I'll be there soon as I can.

16:56.403 --> 17:00.402
And, Benny, tell absolutely no-one,
understand?

17:01.323 --> 17:02.842
Just nipping to the park.

17:02.843 --> 17:04.041
Have fun.

17:04.042 --> 17:08.041
See you in a bit, love.

17:09.042 --> 17:10.082
We're on.

17:10.083 --> 17:14.082
Be careful.

17:37.603 --> 17:39.482
Donnelly...

17:39.483 --> 17:40.722
McCann...

17:40.723 --> 17:42.362
Turk...

17:42.363 --> 17:45.042
One of you cunts has been
in my house,

17:45.043 --> 17:48.002
rifling through my wife's
knicker drawer,

17:48.003 --> 17:51.362
taking pictures of my son,
my family.

17:51.363 --> 17:55.362
Now I want to know who sent you
and why.

17:55.483 --> 17:59.482
Fuck you, Maguire.

18:01.723 --> 18:03.722
Three...

18:03.723 --> 18:07.042
two...

18:07.043 --> 18:08.522
..one.

18:08.523 --> 18:10.602
Yaah!

18:10.603 --> 18:14.602
Strike one!

18:27.883 --> 18:31.762
Look at him...taunting me.

18:31.763 --> 18:34.362
He's a big cock-tease, right enough.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.322
You know the worst of it?

18:36.323 --> 18:39.442
He fucking loves our deep fried
double bacon burgers.

18:39.443 --> 18:41.242
Can't get enough of it.

18:41.243 --> 18:45.242
He's at my work every fucking day
reminding me of my one failure.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.482
Failing to have fucked him
by association

18:49.483 --> 18:51.402
is your biggest failure in life?

18:51.403 --> 18:55.402
My one and only.

18:58.163 --> 19:02.162
Jesus Christ!

19:03.283 --> 19:05.802
Dump them somewhere public,
send out a statement.

19:05.803 --> 19:07.042
No problems, boss.

19:08.763 --> 19:10.002
Mam, what's up?

19:10.003 --> 19:12.922
'They hit Karen.'

19:12.923 --> 19:16.922
I'll be right there.

19:25.003 --> 19:29.002
Fuck!

19:32.403 --> 19:35.082
Ready for some questions, Champ?

19:35.083 --> 19:36.722
I was born ready.

19:36.723 --> 19:38.762
What do you want for Christmas,
lovely?

19:38.763 --> 19:40.442
Michael Jackson tickets.

19:40.443 --> 19:43.162
Special guest appearance by...

19:43.163 --> 19:44.322
Whitney.

19:44.323 --> 19:48.322
If money were no object,
where would you go on your holidays?

19:49.003 --> 19:53.002
New York, dine at that restaurant
on top of them Twin Towers.

19:53.163 --> 19:57.162
380 degrees view out across
Manhat-ley.

19:59.163 --> 20:01.282
What's happened?

20:01.283 --> 20:03.042
She was grabbed in the park.

20:03.043 --> 20:05.522
Slapped her about the face
in front of Connor.

20:05.523 --> 20:09.522
And he stuffed
this down the front of her shirt.

20:13.683 --> 20:17.682
What's going on?

20:18.283 --> 20:22.282
What the fuck is going on?

20:22.603 --> 20:26.602
This isn't the first threat
that's been made.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.482
Well, how many?

20:28.483 --> 20:32.482
Eight maybe.

20:32.523 --> 20:34.882
Who is it?

20:34.883 --> 20:37.202
I'm out of ideas.

20:37.203 --> 20:40.042
Have you done something
to put us at risk?

20:40.043 --> 20:43.202
No.

20:43.203 --> 20:45.922
I am properly scared, Jamie.

20:45.923 --> 20:49.922
How many were there?

20:50.163 --> 20:51.562
I saw one.

20:51.563 --> 20:55.562
Tell him what he said.

20:57.843 --> 21:01.842
That Connor is a legitimate target.

21:10.203 --> 21:13.282
They will do a second test.

21:13.283 --> 21:16.162
Have a consultant examine you.

21:16.163 --> 21:19.922
Things they can do these days...

21:19.923 --> 21:22.722
How many drinks did you have before
you could tell me this?

21:22.723 --> 21:24.202
A few.

21:24.203 --> 21:26.562
I'm probably wrong.

21:26.563 --> 21:28.842
I've no idea what I'm doing.

21:28.843 --> 21:31.322
No, you'll not be wrong.
There's no mistake.

21:31.323 --> 21:34.922
The leukaemia took my mother,
and her sister,

21:34.923 --> 21:38.922
and my grandfather before them.

21:39.163 --> 21:41.842
I knew it would come at some point.

21:41.843 --> 21:44.762
We'll get you to a doctor
first thing.

21:44.763 --> 21:47.282
You'll do no such thing.

21:47.283 --> 21:50.842
If I have it, I'll not be spending
my last days

21:50.843 --> 21:54.162
having radio waves shot through me.

21:54.163 --> 21:58.162
How far gone do you think I am?

21:59.123 --> 22:00.842
I can't possibly know that.

22:00.843 --> 22:04.842
Yesterday, you thought you were
Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman!

22:05.403 --> 22:07.162
You saw the results.

22:07.163 --> 22:11.162
You must have an idea.

22:17.363 --> 22:19.322
Thank you.

22:19.323 --> 22:23.322
If you'll excuse me,
I have things to do.

22:37.803 --> 22:39.082
How is he?

22:39.083 --> 22:40.442
He's fine.

22:40.443 --> 22:43.122
Don't think he even knows.

22:43.123 --> 22:45.922
I couldn't bear it if something
happened to him.

22:45.923 --> 22:47.602
It won't.

22:47.603 --> 22:51.602
Maybe you should leave.
It might be safer.

22:51.763 --> 22:54.642
I'm not going anywhere.

22:54.643 --> 22:57.335
Besides, what would
we be without each other, eh?

23:22.219 --> 23:24.218
What the fuck?!

23:24.219 --> 23:26.338
Woah, woah, woah. Stop it!

23:26.339 --> 23:28.618
This country is brought
to its knees by immigrants.

23:28.619 --> 23:30.698
I'm second generation Bradford!

23:30.699 --> 23:33.418
I'm an immigrant.

23:33.419 --> 23:34.738
You're an immigrant!

23:34.739 --> 23:38.338
I'm Irish. God's chosen tribe!

23:38.339 --> 23:40.098
You don't even believe in God.

23:40.099 --> 23:42.298
I believe in Ireland!

23:42.299 --> 23:43.778
Piss off.

23:50.299 --> 23:52.338
Aww.

23:52.339 --> 23:53.978
Boy or girl?

23:53.979 --> 23:55.138
Girl.

23:55.139 --> 23:59.018
That's the ugliest fecking baby
I ever saw.

23:59.019 --> 24:03.018
Looks like the Michelin Man ate
Angel Delight and took a dump.

24:08.059 --> 24:10.298
You.

24:10.299 --> 24:13.578
It is time you embarked
on the rest of your life

24:13.579 --> 24:16.378
and stopped dressing and behaving
like a Jack Russell

24:16.379 --> 24:17.898
in lipstick and heels.

24:17.899 --> 24:19.778
I beg your pardon?

24:19.779 --> 24:20.978
Another couple of years,

24:20.979 --> 24:24.058
folk'll start thinking you actually
area transvestite,

24:24.059 --> 24:26.018
rather than merely resembling one.

24:26.019 --> 24:27.698
Who spiked your sherry?

24:27.699 --> 24:31.698
Ah! From Middle Earth
comes the dulcet tones

24:31.819 --> 24:32.818
of the Scouse Skank unleashed.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.138
Who the fuck do you think ...

24:34.139 --> 24:37.538
Ah! Now, get back in your box.

24:37.539 --> 24:39.938
You've the face that sank
a thousand ships.

24:39.939 --> 24:43.298
No wonder your husband
ran off to be with the lady-boys.

24:43.299 --> 24:44.538
As for you...

24:44.539 --> 24:48.538
Wheelchair or not, I will kick you
in the minge.

24:49.899 --> 24:53.898
That's all one needs to know
about you.

24:56.339 --> 25:00.338
It's a tremendous sense of freedom.

25:17.019 --> 25:18.138
All right, Barney?

25:18.139 --> 25:19.338
All right?

25:19.339 --> 25:21.378
Prick tease.

25:21.379 --> 25:23.818
Eh, Barney, wait. Hold up.

25:23.819 --> 25:26.418
Love the old deep fried double
bacon burgers, eh?

25:26.419 --> 25:27.978
Heaven sent.

25:27.979 --> 25:31.978
You know, after the breakfast rush,
we toss a whole bunch of them.

25:33.019 --> 25:37.018
They don't want them reheated.
Very big on hygiene and that.

25:37.459 --> 25:40.818
Why don't you come by tomorrow
and I'll, you know,

25:40.819 --> 25:42.338
put some in your direction,

25:42.339 --> 25:45.138
save you forking out
?3.50 for a pile of old...

25:45.139 --> 25:46.978
You know, for a lovely meal.

26:06.619 --> 26:07.818
What's going on?

26:07.819 --> 26:10.698
Emergency review. Wrong patients
been getting the wrong results.

26:10.699 --> 26:14.698
How many? I mean,
have they found anything?

26:15.419 --> 26:18.138
Don't know. It's not just us,
it's all over the North West.

26:18.139 --> 26:20.458
Every hospital, every department.

26:20.459 --> 26:22.418
Oh, well... That's good.

26:22.419 --> 26:26.418
Russian Roulette with blood test
results? Proper spectator sport.

26:29.419 --> 26:32.418
You sure you should be doing that?

26:32.419 --> 26:34.898
My secrets are going with me...

26:34.899 --> 26:37.818
you little gobshite.

26:37.819 --> 26:39.578
Don't need to be so nasty.

26:39.579 --> 26:41.378
Why on earth not?

26:41.379 --> 26:45.378
Slutty little whore that you are?

26:45.819 --> 26:48.938
'Blood tests all over the North
will need to be triple-checked.

26:48.939 --> 26:52.938
'Some lab in Durham cutting
costs or staff or what ever.'

26:53.699 --> 26:55.658
And that's good why?

26:55.659 --> 26:59.418
They're re-testing Patty's sample.
The results were compromised.

26:59.419 --> 27:02.338
She's outside the house now
burning stuff.

27:02.339 --> 27:04.978
You have to tell her there's
been a mistake.

27:04.979 --> 27:06.018
Yeah, right.

27:06.019 --> 27:07.338
She needs to know.

27:07.339 --> 27:08.778
'Please.'

27:08.779 --> 27:12.778
Shovel your own shit.

27:12.979 --> 27:16.978
Oi, Reese Witherspoon. If you're
finished with your nails?

27:26.139 --> 27:28.458
Is he gone?

27:28.459 --> 27:31.098
Sally will have him till the weekend.

27:31.099 --> 27:35.098
Are you going to be OK?

27:35.139 --> 27:36.818
Couple more possibilities.

27:36.819 --> 27:39.458
I'll have the lads with me.

27:39.459 --> 27:41.818
There's a couple of guys
downstairs, inside and out.

27:41.819 --> 27:45.818
Everything will be fine.

27:53.659 --> 27:57.658
Out. Now.

28:00.219 --> 28:03.498
Is this you?

28:03.499 --> 28:05.458
What is... Ow!

28:05.459 --> 28:08.458
Are you threatening my family?

28:08.459 --> 28:09.738
No, I'm not! Don't be stupid.

28:09.739 --> 28:11.058
Who have you told about us?

28:11.059 --> 28:12.258
No-one.

28:12.259 --> 28:13.578
Dominic knew!

28:13.579 --> 28:16.938
That was to save your fucking life.

28:16.939 --> 28:19.218
Would Dominic have told anyone?

28:19.219 --> 28:23.218
He keeps secrets for a living.
What is going on?!

28:30.299 --> 28:32.618
'Jamie? Jamie, I'm sorry...'

28:32.619 --> 28:34.778
Karen?

28:34.779 --> 28:38.778
'I'll call you at 6pm this evening,
let you know if she's still alive.'

28:40.299 --> 28:44.298
Jamie?

28:45.259 --> 28:49.258
I'm sorry.

28:53.459 --> 28:55.218
How the fuck?

28:55.219 --> 28:57.138
We didn't know she'd gone out.

28:57.139 --> 29:00.418
You should've told us. I might've
been able to help.

29:00.419 --> 29:02.858
And don't give me the stare
cos I won't take it off you.

29:02.859 --> 29:05.538
This isn't the time.
What's the plan?

29:05.539 --> 29:07.098
Nothing to do till six o'clock.

29:07.099 --> 29:10.178
We really don't know
anything about these fucks?

29:10.179 --> 29:12.298
All the usual suspects,
none of them.

29:12.299 --> 29:16.298
That's what we know.

29:18.339 --> 29:21.058
So, first of all, I was dying...

29:21.059 --> 29:25.058
and now I am not dying.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.258
I don't know.

29:27.259 --> 29:29.218
They're going to re-test
your sample.

29:29.219 --> 29:31.578
Chances are you've just got a virus
or something.

29:31.579 --> 29:33.298
I destroyed my possessions

29:33.299 --> 29:37.218
and allowed a bank transfer of all
my savings to my idiot daughter.

29:37.219 --> 29:38.658
How is Libby?

29:38.659 --> 29:40.698
She's an idiot, like she always was.

29:40.699 --> 29:42.258
And don't try to distract

29:42.259 --> 29:44.858
by feigning concern
where you have none.

29:44.859 --> 29:47.978
There's nothing noble
in telling a lie to protect a liar.

29:47.979 --> 29:51.818
I've burnt my bridges left
and right,

29:51.819 --> 29:55.818
told everyone my true opinion,
that they're arseholes,

29:56.099 --> 30:00.098
and now will be completely isolated.

30:02.579 --> 30:06.578
We could say I gave you the wrong
pills and that you were confused.

30:08.019 --> 30:12.018
Oh, because doolally and old folk
are natural bedfellows, of course!

30:15.139 --> 30:19.138
I think we've heard enough
stories from you, don't you think?

30:30.939 --> 30:32.098
You OK?

30:32.099 --> 30:33.618
Getting there.

30:33.619 --> 30:37.138
It's a recognised condition,
'historophobia'.

30:37.139 --> 30:41.018
The American Medical Association
classifies it as a proper phobia.

30:41.019 --> 30:43.058
So, it's just totally random?

30:43.059 --> 30:45.698
No, no, no. It's historical facts
she can't cope with.

30:45.699 --> 30:48.738
That would upset her
so she just blanks them out.

30:48.739 --> 30:49.858
Pretends they never happened?

30:49.859 --> 30:51.138
Yeah. Pretty much.

30:51.139 --> 30:53.578
But then she'd have to rewrite
the whole of history.

30:53.579 --> 30:55.378
That's what's fascinating.

30:55.379 --> 30:57.738
She's created this whole
narrative in her own head.

30:57.739 --> 31:01.098
She lives in a parallel universe.

31:01.099 --> 31:05.098
Well, that would explain a great
fucking deal.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.978
Jamie.

31:11.979 --> 31:13.418
Everything all right?

31:13.419 --> 31:17.418
Mind your own business.

31:37.179 --> 31:38.698
I want to fucking...

31:38.699 --> 31:42.338
'Jamie, I'm all right.
Tell him to fuck right off.'

31:42.339 --> 31:46.338
Karen!

31:47.459 --> 31:50.938
'You're still here?
I take it your wife's disposable.'

31:50.939 --> 31:53.298
Anything but.

31:53.299 --> 31:56.458
She's done nothing.

31:56.459 --> 31:57.698
Take me.

31:57.699 --> 32:01.698
I'll go anywhere, any time.

32:03.339 --> 32:04.818
Are you still there?

32:04.819 --> 32:08.818
'Tomorrow morning, be in your shitty
Merc, on Findhorn Road at 9am.

32:09.139 --> 32:13.138
'No vests, no mates,
no pals watching your arse.'

32:13.619 --> 32:16.658
Fine.

32:16.659 --> 32:18.658
'And you've put me
in a lot of trouble,

32:18.659 --> 32:22.658
'so make sure you
bring 200 grand with you.'

32:23.379 --> 32:26.498
I don't have that kind of money.

32:26.499 --> 32:28.018
'Then I'll kill your wife.'

32:33.231 --> 32:36.030
OK. We'll get a couple of motors,
plain but sharp, you know.

32:36.112 --> 32:38.194
Keep a distance.
Too risky.

32:38.198 --> 32:41.397
We'll never collect 200 grand
across one night, love,

32:41.398 --> 32:45.117
we could borrow it, but we might
as well paint targets on our backs.

32:45.118 --> 32:47.977
Besides, if it's a choice
between you and her...

32:48.050 --> 32:49.929
Will they stop there?

32:49.930 --> 32:53.929
What if it's you the next time?
Or Cilla?

32:54.050 --> 32:55.449
I've got the money.

32:55.450 --> 32:57.289
You what?

32:57.290 --> 33:01.289
I've got it. Going away fund
in case of a moonlight flit.

33:01.930 --> 33:03.889
If something happens...

33:03.890 --> 33:07.529
take Karen and Connor
and help them start somewhere else,

33:07.530 --> 33:11.529
away from here.

33:32.690 --> 33:36.689
Who was Britain's first woman
Prime Minister?

33:37.170 --> 33:41.169
Don't be silly, you can't have
a woman Prime Minister.

33:41.970 --> 33:45.849
Who is the England football manager?

33:45.850 --> 33:49.849
The Italian. You know,
the one that looks like Mrs Brown.

33:50.170 --> 33:54.169
Look, you fucking mad Afrikaner!

33:54.330 --> 33:57.529
Even if you don't believe it,
learn it, pass the test,

33:57.530 --> 34:01.209
or there'll be no passport
and no fucking holiday to Benidorm!

34:01.210 --> 34:03.449
But I love them documentaries.

34:03.450 --> 34:07.449
Just learn it, parrot-fashion,
try not to think!

34:08.489 --> 34:10.449
I'll try.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.889
She's got no chance.

34:12.889 --> 34:14.489
They'll deport her.

34:14.489 --> 34:16.168
Couldn't someone go with her?

34:16.170 --> 34:17.768
You think they let mates in?!

34:17.770 --> 34:19.929
No, but take the test alongside her,

34:19.929 --> 34:23.728
less intimidating
if she had a pal there.

34:53.210 --> 34:57.209
Keys.

35:06.290 --> 35:08.569
Put these on,...
put your own clothes inside.

35:08.570 --> 35:12.569
Fuck you.

35:14.770 --> 35:18.769
Wait!

35:33.130 --> 35:37.089
This how you get your kicks,
is it, stripping men?

35:37.090 --> 35:41.089
Follow the Sat-Nav. When you get
there, leave the money in the car.

35:57.450 --> 36:01.449
'Turn right'.

36:04.690 --> 36:08.689
Be right with you, two minutes.

36:10.570 --> 36:13.169
Here we go. The one that got away.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.729
Yeah! Complete the set.

36:18.850 --> 36:20.249
Frank?!

36:20.250 --> 36:21.729
It's not what it looks like!

36:25.850 --> 36:29.849
OK, maybe it is.

36:56.090 --> 37:00.089
Hello?

37:00.130 --> 37:01.849
I'm unarmed!

37:03.050 --> 37:07.049
Oi! You fuck!

37:21.690 --> 37:24.049
I'm here!

37:24.050 --> 37:28.049
Got my money.

37:44.170 --> 37:46.649
If I don't get my wife back
safe and smiling,

37:46.650 --> 37:50.649
you will be found, you fuck!

37:58.890 --> 38:02.889
Thank fuck!
I thought they'd bluffed me.

38:05.570 --> 38:07.289
Are you all right, Karen?

38:07.290 --> 38:09.329
I will be.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.849
Right come on, babe. We need
to get out of here, it's not safe.

38:12.850 --> 38:16.849
Nobody's coming, Jamie.

38:18.410 --> 38:20.089
Nobody's coming.

38:20.090 --> 38:22.249
What are you talking about?

38:22.250 --> 38:26.249
Just me.

38:29.810 --> 38:33.809
'Still here?
I take it your wife is disposable?'

38:34.810 --> 38:38.689
'Still here?
I take it your wife is disposable.'

38:38.690 --> 38:42.689
It's an App. Any kid
can get it for a couple of quid.

38:48.610 --> 38:50.649
You lied to me.

38:57.690 --> 38:58.729
I'll get it.

38:58.730 --> 39:02.729
No, it's all right. I've got it.
Go back to sleep.

39:05.090 --> 39:08.329
'You better stay in your hole,
you little fucking prick,

39:08.330 --> 39:10.849
'cos I will cut your throat
from ear to fucking ear.'

39:10.850 --> 39:14.849
The phone calls, the text
messages... the pictures.

39:17.970 --> 39:19.929
All me.

39:19.930 --> 39:23.929
Guy in the park?

39:26.130 --> 39:28.809
Me. There was no guy.

39:28.810 --> 39:32.409
Hi!

39:32.410 --> 39:36.369
I went to great lengths
because this matters.

39:36.370 --> 39:40.209
This is family.

39:40.210 --> 39:42.089
The kidnapping?

39:42.090 --> 39:44.889
A night in the Marriott,
it wasn't too shabby.

39:44.890 --> 39:47.009
Are you off your meds?

39:47.010 --> 39:49.889
No, you cunt!

39:49.890 --> 39:51.889
You fucked Gloria.

39:53.450 --> 39:56.209
You could've fucked all of
Manchester and I'd never have known,

39:56.210 --> 40:00.209
but you didn't.

40:03.730 --> 40:05.009
It was a mistake.

40:05.010 --> 40:08.409
Yeah, too fucking right!

40:08.410 --> 40:09.449
What if I'd left?

40:09.450 --> 40:12.089
Then I'd have known
that we don't matter to you.

40:12.090 --> 40:15.289
But we do.

40:15.290 --> 40:17.049
I do.

40:17.050 --> 40:21.049
You stood up for your family.

40:23.650 --> 40:27.649
Good for you.

40:29.210 --> 40:31.449
I'm impressed.

40:31.450 --> 40:35.449
Things will be different.

40:39.250 --> 40:42.889
'Now, I'm in charge.

40:42.890 --> 40:46.889
'Though only you and I
need to know that.'

40:48.850 --> 40:52.569
'How's that gonna work?'

40:52.570 --> 40:56.569
'Every bit of money comes through
me, income and expenditure.

40:57.890 --> 41:00.969
'You probably think
you can hide some,

41:00.970 --> 41:04.489
'like you did with the 200K,
but I will know.

41:04.490 --> 41:06.049
'And, by the way,...

41:06.050 --> 41:10.049
'your going-away fund
is now my going-away fund.'

41:20.690 --> 41:22.569
What if it doesn't work?

41:22.570 --> 41:25.249
It will.

41:25.250 --> 41:26.849
You love me...

41:26.850 --> 41:30.849
and despite all your weaknesses...

41:33.610 --> 41:35.329
..I love you.

41:35.330 --> 41:38.369
Now, should anything
ever happen to me,

41:38.370 --> 41:41.609
my friend in the Ford
has a lot of information...

41:41.610 --> 41:43.449
on your past...

41:43.450 --> 41:46.129
and your present.

41:46.130 --> 41:48.369
Who is he?

41:48.370 --> 41:52.369
Every marriage has its secret.

42:02.130 --> 42:05.529
I know, and I'm sorry, but...

42:05.530 --> 42:09.449
I'll be right with you.

42:09.450 --> 42:10.649
Everything all right?

42:10.650 --> 42:13.089
It's these fucking re-tests!

42:13.090 --> 42:15.969
They want the drug history of ICU
going back a month.

42:15.970 --> 42:17.409
Are these the false results?

42:17.410 --> 42:19.809
No, they're originals.

42:19.810 --> 42:21.729
All triple-checked. They're accurate.

42:21.730 --> 42:22.849
Are you sure?

42:22.850 --> 42:26.849
It's a good job you're pretty.

42:37.410 --> 42:41.409
This is me final word on it
and I won't keep going on,

42:41.650 --> 42:45.649
but there are reasons governments
and corporations don't pay ransoms.

42:45.690 --> 42:49.609
Now every one of us is a target,
cos they know we'll pay out.

42:49.610 --> 42:52.529
Thanks, Mum. I'm glad you're
not gonna keep going on about it.

42:52.530 --> 42:55.849
I won't!

42:55.850 --> 42:59.129
Hi, love.

42:59.130 --> 43:00.969
Frank, it's over,
leave the man alone now!

43:02.410 --> 43:05.089
Yeah, you're probably right.

43:05.090 --> 43:08.249
Things are better imperfect,
you know, they're not...finished.

43:08.250 --> 43:10.929
Will you still get your dole money,
now that you've been fired?

43:10.930 --> 43:13.009
I weren't fired.

43:13.010 --> 43:17.009
Technically, my position fell
victim to internal restructuring.

43:17.810 --> 43:20.569
Oh!
So they didn't want bad publicity?

43:20.570 --> 43:21.769
"Worker spunks in burger".

43:21.770 --> 43:24.169
For an alcoholic,
you're a very astute man.

43:24.170 --> 43:25.489
I'll drink to that.

43:26.570 --> 43:28.649
Someone's got the love-balls in.

43:28.650 --> 43:29.449
I'm official.

43:29.450 --> 43:30.889
Passed her citizenship test.

43:30.890 --> 43:33.249
Stood in the queue.
She's all passport-ed up!

43:33.250 --> 43:35.169
Good for you.

43:35.170 --> 43:37.169
What's up with sour puss?

43:37.170 --> 43:38.689
Fucking failed the test!

43:38.690 --> 43:39.729
7 out of 24.

43:39.730 --> 43:43.729
Serve these
while I go and see to Cilla.

43:44.050 --> 43:45.409
Tell her.

43:45.410 --> 43:46.849
I can't.

43:46.850 --> 43:49.689
"You're dying, you're not dying,
you're dying." It's cruel.

43:49.690 --> 43:52.449
Let this be the end of all
that Doctor Dolittle stuff.

43:52.450 --> 43:56.449
Doctor Dolittle talked to the
animals, you fucking arsehole!

44:00.050 --> 44:04.049
You absolutely loathe me, don't you?

44:18.290 --> 44:21.209
'My husband has killed men.

44:21.210 --> 44:22.609
'He's a strong man...

44:22.610 --> 44:26.609
'a violent man, if need be.

44:27.250 --> 44:30.929
'I love my husband.'

44:30.930 --> 44:34.649
'But he lied to me too often...
too harshly,

44:34.650 --> 44:38.649
'and now things have altered,
permanently.

44:38.930 --> 44:41.649
'You'd do well to remember,

44:41.650 --> 44:45.649
'revenge is a dish best served....
female.'

45:29.010 --> 45:32.729
Oh, yeah. I've had her....and her.

45:32.730 --> 45:36.169
Well, I've had her... and her.

45:36.170 --> 45:38.609
I've had her...

45:38.610 --> 45:40.689
and her sister.

45:40.690 --> 45:44.209
Well, I've had the mother,
a night I'd rather forget.

45:44.210 --> 45:47.169
I've had her,
when she was married to Terry B.

45:47.170 --> 45:51.169
