00:21.854 --> 00:23.048
Hello?

00:29.028 --> 00:30.188
Hello?

00:39.272 --> 00:41.137
You stay there.
Don't move.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.641
Ah. You know,
I've been casing this joint all week.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.042
You're supposed to
be asleep by now.

01:13.873 --> 01:16.205
It's a jungle out there

01:16.275 --> 01:19.335
Disorder and confusion
everywhere

01:20.980 --> 01:23.005
No one seems to care

01:23.082 --> 01:24.140
Well, I do

01:24.217 --> 01:27.084
Hey, who's in charge here?

01:27.153 --> 01:29.417
It's a jungle out there

01:30.990 --> 01:34.187
Poison in the very air
we breathe

01:34.260 --> 01:36.660
You know what's in the water
that you drink?

01:36.729 --> 01:37.718
Well, I do

01:37.797 --> 01:40.994
It's amazing

01:41.067 --> 01:42.500
People think I'm crazy

01:42.568 --> 01:44.263
'cause I worry
all the time

01:44.337 --> 01:47.568
If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too

01:47.640 --> 01:48.971
You better pay attention

01:49.042 --> 01:51.909
Or this world
we love so much

01:51.978 --> 01:55.038
might just kill you

01:55.715 --> 01:57.876
I could be wrong now

01:57.950 --> 01:59.713
But I don't think so

01:59.786 --> 02:02.482
'Cause there's
a jungle out there

02:02.555 --> 02:04.682
It's a jungle out there

02:21.265 --> 02:22.994
You like my hair.

02:23.067 --> 02:26.127
Yeah. I like your new haircut.
I think he did a good job.

02:26.203 --> 02:27.727
What's the catch?

02:27.805 --> 02:29.238
There's no catch.
I think it looks good.

02:29.306 --> 02:31.035
You've been complimenting me all day.

02:31.108 --> 02:32.575
First, you think
I should write a book.

02:32.643 --> 02:35.111
Now, you like
my haircut?

02:35.179 --> 02:38.444
What are you after? I mean...
You're up to something.

02:38.515 --> 02:41.848
Right. Did you want a day off?
Is that it? You want tomorrow off.

02:41.919 --> 02:44.513
No. Maybe I like you.
Maybe I'm just being nice.

02:44.588 --> 02:45.953
Isn't that possible?

02:46.023 --> 02:47.888
You're up to
something.

02:47.958 --> 02:49.721
You know what?
I take it back.

02:49.793 --> 02:52.523
I think your haircut
looks terrible. Okay?

02:52.596 --> 02:55.565
Geez, Mr. Monk. You know?
I'm just being nice.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.692
There isn't
always a catch.

02:59.036 --> 03:00.367
All right.
The light is broken.

03:00.437 --> 03:01.529
I think
we should just go.

03:01.605 --> 03:03.038
No, it says
"Don't Walk."

03:03.107 --> 03:04.972
Yeah. But we've been here for 10 minutes.
The light's broken.

03:05.042 --> 03:07.272
It says "Don't Walk."

03:08.379 --> 03:10.779
All right. How about this?
You stay here.

03:10.848 --> 03:13.009
I'm going to go pick up our checks.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.914
Wait...
How about this?

03:14.985 --> 03:17.613
We don't do
what you said.

03:17.688 --> 03:20.589
We both wait here,
and we give it a little more time.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.592
Okay.
What are you doing?

03:22.660 --> 03:26.596
Are you insane? It says "Don't Walk."
What is your problem?

03:26.664 --> 03:28.131
Mr. Monk.
There's no traffic.

03:28.198 --> 03:30.564
There are no cars.
Are you coming?

03:32.569 --> 03:35.163
All right. You stay here.
I'll be back.

03:46.684 --> 03:47.946
Morning.

03:51.588 --> 03:53.579
Is that thing
broken again?

03:53.657 --> 03:55.090
I don't know.

03:55.159 --> 03:57.627
That light is
always breaking down.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.630
I've called the traffic
bureau about it twice.

04:00.698 --> 04:04.759
They don't listen to me. To them,
I'm just a crazy old coot.

04:04.835 --> 04:06.928
Well, I'm going to give it another half hour.

04:07.004 --> 04:10.235
Nonsense.
We're crossing the street.

04:10.307 --> 04:11.774
It says "Don't Walk."

04:11.842 --> 04:14.936
That's just a rule.
There's nobody coming.

04:15.012 --> 04:16.707
Hey, be a pirate.

04:17.613 --> 04:19.343
It's fun to
be a pirate.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.007
A pirate?

04:21.084 --> 04:22.279
Come on.

04:31.762 --> 04:32.956
There.

04:33.897 --> 04:35.626
Now, wasn't
that fun?

04:36.834 --> 04:38.768
Can I carry your bag?

04:39.737 --> 04:41.534
Why, sure. Thank you.

04:45.109 --> 04:48.510
Uh. Sign here.
And here.

04:49.847 --> 04:52.042
Okay. That's it.
All paid up.

04:52.116 --> 04:55.313
All right. There he is.
You made it.

04:56.787 --> 04:59.051
Hey. I heard you had
a little disagreement

04:59.123 --> 05:00.647
with the "Don't Walk" sign?

05:00.724 --> 05:02.783
But here you are.
I knew you could do it.

05:02.860 --> 05:04.122
Actually, I had
a little help.

05:04.194 --> 05:05.684
Hey. Don't tell me.

05:05.763 --> 05:08.231
A little old lady took you by the
arm and helped you across the street.

05:08.298 --> 05:11.199
She's not that little.
She's right over there.

05:11.268 --> 05:12.826
That's Marge.

05:14.204 --> 05:15.899
How perfect is that?
You know her?

05:15.973 --> 05:18.908
Know her? Monk, every cop
in the precinct knows her.

05:18.976 --> 05:22.776
They wish they didn't.
She's here all the time complaining.

05:22.846 --> 05:25.178
He does it
every single night.

05:25.249 --> 05:27.911
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
Boom, boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom.

05:27.985 --> 05:30.545
I mean, loud.
You could hear it five blocks away.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.953
Marge,
we've warned him twice.

05:33.023 --> 05:34.991
See? He's already
been cited.

05:35.058 --> 05:37.390
Well, but what am I
supposed to do?

05:37.461 --> 05:40.726
I can't sleep.
I can't read. It never ends.

05:40.798 --> 05:44.427
He has a court date.
November 17th.

05:44.501 --> 05:48.437
If you can wait until then,
maybe the judge will issue an injunction.

05:48.505 --> 05:51.770
Hi. Hi again.
It's Adrian Monk. Remember me?

05:51.842 --> 05:53.537
Sure.
Yeah. What's going on?

05:53.610 --> 05:55.942
Disturbing the peace.
It's no big deal.

05:56.013 --> 05:57.981
Well, it's a big deal
to me.

05:58.048 --> 06:00.380
You know,
it's my peace he's disturbing.

06:00.451 --> 06:03.215
Yeah. It's her peace.
It's a big deal to her.

06:03.287 --> 06:04.413
Yeah.

06:05.689 --> 06:08.954
It... We're talking about my
next-door neighbor. Mr. Keyes.

06:09.026 --> 06:11.017
He bought a set of drums two weeks ago.

06:11.094 --> 06:13.824
And I haven't
slept in 10 days.

06:13.897 --> 06:16.923
I'm just desperate.
I can't get anybody to do anything about it.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.935
I was just explaining
to Miss Johnson here

06:20.003 --> 06:22.437
that the department
has other priorities.

06:22.506 --> 06:25.669
Well, maybe the department does,
but I don't.

06:25.742 --> 06:28.575
Okay. Lf... If this
happens again,

06:29.246 --> 06:32.977
call the dispatcher, and have him
forward the call to me. Adrian Monk.

06:33.050 --> 06:35.143
I'll take care of it.

06:35.219 --> 06:36.584
Really?

06:36.653 --> 06:37.847
Sure.

06:38.455 --> 06:39.513
Thank you.

06:39.590 --> 06:40.921
No, it...

06:41.792 --> 06:43.453
You are such a good boy.

06:43.527 --> 06:44.687
Oh.

06:44.761 --> 06:48.561
Yeah, you are.
I can tell by your eyes. Yeah.

06:48.632 --> 06:50.657
I can tell a lot of things about people.

06:50.734 --> 06:52.099
I am... I am
a good boy.

06:52.169 --> 06:53.659
You are.

06:53.737 --> 06:54.931
You want a piece
of candy?

06:55.005 --> 06:57.701
Umm. Yeah. No. I don't.

06:57.774 --> 06:59.071
Take it.
Okay.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.147
Excuse me.

07:09.086 --> 07:11.247
Is that absolutely
necessary?

07:12.456 --> 07:13.514
Is what necessary?

07:13.590 --> 07:15.421
Removing the body.

07:15.492 --> 07:18.290
I'm Miles Franklin.
I'm the curator here.

07:18.362 --> 07:21.593
As you can see,
this is a world record museum.

07:21.665 --> 07:23.530
So I gathered.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.194
There was already one
victim on the swordfish.

07:26.270 --> 07:28.795
That was already
pretty impressive.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.966
You understand.
This is like a godsend for us.

07:32.042 --> 07:34.442
We pray for things
like this.

07:34.511 --> 07:37.503
Sir, that...
That's a human being.

07:37.581 --> 07:39.947
He had a name.
He had a family.

07:40.017 --> 07:41.575
We pray for things
like this.

07:41.652 --> 07:44.314
This'll be bigger than those
twins on the motorcycles.

07:44.388 --> 07:46.185
Will you go stand
over there, please?

07:47.090 --> 07:49.752
What is that? Is that candy?
Where did you get that?

07:49.826 --> 07:51.123
A friend.

07:51.828 --> 07:52.852
What friend?

07:52.930 --> 07:55.194
I made a friend.
It could happen.

07:55.265 --> 07:58.200
It's that lady, isn't it?
That sweet old lady, Marge.

07:58.268 --> 08:01.237
She gave you candy.
That is so cute.

08:01.305 --> 08:02.431
You're eating her candy.

08:02.506 --> 08:05.031
That's enough
about the candy.

08:05.108 --> 08:07.542
Doesn't look
like a robbery.

08:07.611 --> 08:10.478
There was 250 bucks in the cash register.
He didn't touch it.

08:10.547 --> 08:13.641
What about the exhibits?
Is anything missing?

08:13.717 --> 08:15.082
We haven't done
a full inventory yet,

08:15.152 --> 08:16.449
but I haven't
noticed anything.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.045
Where's Togo?
Where's who?

08:19.122 --> 08:22.091
Togo the egg-eating robot.
He was right here.

08:25.829 --> 08:27.228
He's right.
I don't know how I missed that.

08:27.297 --> 08:28.855
Togo's been
here for years.

08:28.932 --> 08:31.196
It's a mechanical display.

08:31.268 --> 08:34.169
Good work, Randy.
How did you know it was missing?

08:34.236 --> 08:36.636
Well, I come here every year on my birthday.

08:36.707 --> 08:39.505
It's kind of like
a family tradition.

08:39.576 --> 08:41.567
When you were a kid.
Yeah.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.710
You meant when
you were a kid.

08:46.783 --> 08:48.341
Say "yes," Randy.

08:49.286 --> 08:50.378
Yes.

08:51.254 --> 08:53.586
All right. So, they broke in,
they killed a security guard,

08:53.657 --> 08:56.182
and stole
an egg-eating robot.

08:56.259 --> 08:58.727
Now, could the machine
possibly be involved?

08:58.795 --> 09:00.319
What did you say?

09:00.397 --> 09:03.423
Well, in science fiction,
they sometimes come alive.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.297
They become sentient.

09:08.905 --> 09:10.429
Well, if this were a movie,
you'd believe me.

09:10.507 --> 09:13.340
If this were a movie,
I could walk out, Randy. What have you got?

09:13.410 --> 09:14.843
Tire tracks.

09:19.282 --> 09:20.579
That's hydraulic fluid.

09:20.651 --> 09:22.881
Yeah. Togo was dripping.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.116
Get a sample of this.

09:25.188 --> 09:27.418
Well, we know we're looking for one guy.

09:27.491 --> 09:29.652
How do you figure?
Well, if it were two or more,

09:29.726 --> 09:32.752
they would have
just carried it out.

09:32.829 --> 09:37.596
This guy brought in a hand truck.
And this sign looks like new.

09:37.668 --> 09:39.602
No nicks or
scratches.

09:39.670 --> 09:42.332
Didn't you say this display
has been here for years?

09:42.406 --> 09:44.431
We had to replace
that plaque.

09:44.508 --> 09:48.911
About two months ago, some nut from
Berkeley spray-painted all over it.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.879
He says that he broke
the world record,

09:50.947 --> 09:53.279
and it should be him
in the museum.

09:53.350 --> 09:55.147
A jealous egg-eater.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.715
God help us.
We have a motive.

09:57.788 --> 09:59.449
Hello? Yes?

10:00.123 --> 10:02.455
Yes, he is.
Hold on one minute.

10:02.526 --> 10:05.757
Mr. Monk. It's Marge.

10:07.831 --> 10:09.196
Hello?
- Adrian?

10:09.633 --> 10:11.100
This is Marge.

10:11.168 --> 10:12.635
I'm sorry to bother you,
honey.

10:12.703 --> 10:15.228
But you did say I could call you anytime.

10:15.305 --> 10:17.865
Marge? Is that you?
I can barely hear you.

10:17.941 --> 10:19.033
It's him again.

10:19.109 --> 10:22.601
That's my neighbor. I tell you.
I don't know what to do.

10:22.679 --> 10:25.910
He's just driving me crazy.
I am at my wit's end.

10:55.787 --> 10:56.947
Yeah.

10:57.889 --> 11:00.949
Hi.
I wonder if you could keep it down.

11:01.025 --> 11:02.253
You're disturbing
the neighbors.

11:02.326 --> 11:04.760
I'm practicing.
I'm a musician.

11:05.463 --> 11:07.727
I understand.
But it's so loud.

11:07.799 --> 11:11.200
And you've been playing
all day, and... Really?

11:11.269 --> 11:12.327
Oh.

11:12.637 --> 11:16.164
I get it.
The crone from next door sent you.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.867
She's not a crone.

11:17.942 --> 11:19.603
Whoa. What are you,
her favorite nephew?

11:19.677 --> 11:23.169
Look. You tell your auntie that I'm
an artist and I'm expressing myself.

11:23.247 --> 11:25.408
What, if, if Picasso was
living next door to her,

11:25.483 --> 11:26.643
would she be complaining
about him?

11:26.717 --> 11:30.278
I'm not her nephew.
I'm with the police, more or less.

11:31.289 --> 11:32.779
More or less?

11:33.791 --> 11:34.883
Yeah.

11:40.498 --> 11:41.658
Okay.

11:42.266 --> 11:45.394
Okay what?
I was going to take a break anyway.

11:45.469 --> 11:47.903
Okay, then. Okay.

11:47.972 --> 11:51.533
Well, have a nice,
quiet day.

12:02.353 --> 12:04.082
He stopped!
Yeah.

12:04.155 --> 12:06.715
What on earth
did you say to him?

12:06.791 --> 12:11.194
Well, I told him you were a friend
of mine and he got the message.

12:11.729 --> 12:13.663
Oh. Just like that?

12:14.632 --> 12:18.398
Well, I'm impressed.
You're a regular John Wayne.

12:19.170 --> 12:22.139
Uh, except, you know,
he needed a gun.

12:24.208 --> 12:27.075
Anyway. I'm glad
I could help.

12:27.144 --> 12:30.875
Now.
I don't reckon he'll be bothering you again.

12:31.782 --> 12:33.340
I guess I'll have
Natalie pick me up.

12:33.417 --> 12:34.816
Oh, where are you going?

12:34.886 --> 12:38.344
I mean,
I guess you have to go someplace.

12:38.422 --> 12:39.855
Not really.

12:40.524 --> 12:42.321
Good. Good.
Come on in, then.

12:42.393 --> 12:45.624
Yeah. You just have to stay
here and tell me all about it.

12:45.696 --> 12:46.754
Okay.

12:46.898 --> 12:48.058
Well.

12:48.132 --> 12:51.295
I bet you're hungry, right?
Boys are always hungry.

12:51.969 --> 12:53.664
Did you have anything
to eat today?

12:53.738 --> 12:56.070
Well, I had that peppermint you gave me.

12:56.140 --> 12:59.371
Oh, that's not real food.
I mean, food.

12:59.977 --> 13:01.808
I don't want to impose.

13:01.879 --> 13:04.040
I was just making lunch.

13:04.115 --> 13:05.742
I love your house.

13:05.816 --> 13:07.010
Do you?

13:07.084 --> 13:09.575
Did you grow up
in a place like this?

13:09.654 --> 13:13.055
I, I grew up wishing
it was a place like this.

13:16.661 --> 13:18.128
Is this you?

13:18.896 --> 13:22.662
Yep. I always wanted
to write a cookbook.

13:23.534 --> 13:26.196
Of course,
I let it go until I was 65.

13:26.270 --> 13:28.261
And then you know
what my sister said?

13:28.339 --> 13:31.433
She said,
"You can't write a cookbook at 65.

13:31.509 --> 13:33.568
"Besides, nobody cooks
anymore, anyway."

13:33.644 --> 13:36.579
She said, "You're 65.
You retire."

13:36.647 --> 13:38.672
So, you two
aren't close?

13:38.749 --> 13:41.377
Well, she means well.

13:44.555 --> 13:46.079
Piano. Do you play?

13:46.157 --> 13:47.886
Just one song.
Greensleeves.

13:47.959 --> 13:49.586
My husband, Theo,
taught it to me.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.753
Well, I'd love to hear it.
Well, that's very sweet of you.

13:51.829 --> 13:55.356
But I only play it once a year.
On his birthday.

13:57.368 --> 13:59.165
When did he pass?

13:59.236 --> 14:00.863
Twelve years ago.

14:01.472 --> 14:03.463
By the calendar,
12 years.

14:04.075 --> 14:06.873
In here, of course,
day before yesterday.

14:13.284 --> 14:14.979
You had a child.

14:15.786 --> 14:18.050
I only see
the one photograph.

14:18.522 --> 14:20.114
We lost him, too.

14:21.559 --> 14:23.584
Paulie.
His name was Paulie.

14:24.362 --> 14:26.489
He was just
three years old.

14:27.498 --> 14:29.295
He'd be about
your age.

14:30.267 --> 14:31.859
Yeah, he would.

14:32.303 --> 14:35.272
Oh, listen. Enough.
Time goes on.

14:36.874 --> 14:39.900
I know. And it
keeps going on.

14:41.812 --> 14:43.677
It's relentless.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.212
Come on. Let's eat.

14:47.618 --> 14:48.710
Okay.

14:57.094 --> 14:58.254
What are you doing?

14:58.329 --> 14:59.990
Well, I just thought...

15:00.064 --> 15:02.225
You haven't even
washed your hands.

15:02.299 --> 15:04.233
Were you brought up
in a barn?

15:06.704 --> 15:07.932
What's so funny?

15:08.005 --> 15:10.803
I forgot
to wash my hands.

15:11.275 --> 15:14.711
Um. I'm usually pretty good
about that kind of stuff.

15:15.446 --> 15:16.811
And use soap.

15:16.881 --> 15:18.178
Yes, ma'am.

15:21.585 --> 15:24.713
What does a police consultant do, actually?

15:24.789 --> 15:28.281
Oh, I do what any regular detective does.

15:28.359 --> 15:31.658
Except I'm not
really on the team.

15:32.396 --> 15:34.330
Really?
That doesn't sound fair.

15:34.398 --> 15:36.389
They have their reasons.

15:36.467 --> 15:38.367
I'm going to write them
a letter about it.

15:38.436 --> 15:40.097
Oh. No, Marge.
You don't have to do that.

15:40.171 --> 15:41.729
No, no, I...
Don't worry.

15:41.806 --> 15:44.832
I am just going to tell everybody
what a help you were to me

15:44.909 --> 15:47.104
with that Buddy Rich
neighbor of mine.

15:49.246 --> 15:53.046
What are you doing?
I'm just separating my...

15:53.551 --> 15:56.520
No. No. These are
mixed vegetables.

15:56.587 --> 15:59.488
They're supposed to be
mixed like this. See?

15:59.757 --> 16:03.818
You just mix them all together and then,
you eat them all together.

16:04.095 --> 16:06.928
You can see I have really
slaved over this lunch.

16:07.531 --> 16:08.691
Eat.

16:11.602 --> 16:15.060
So what do you think that your
next project is going to be?

16:15.139 --> 16:17.972
Think it's going to be
something important?

16:18.409 --> 16:21.037
Well, it's interesting,
actually.

16:23.380 --> 16:26.178
Somebody killed a security guard last night.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.740
Killed him?

16:27.818 --> 16:31.948
I haven't figured it out, yet.
It happened at the Guinness Museum.

16:32.022 --> 16:34.582
And the only thing that was
missing was one display.

16:34.658 --> 16:38.822
A mechanical man.
It was a robot, actually.

16:39.864 --> 16:41.126
A robot?

16:41.932 --> 16:45.060
An egg-eating robot.
Oh, my word.

16:45.136 --> 16:48.162
It's just one insane thing
after another, now, isn't it?

16:48.239 --> 16:49.797
Yes, ma'am.

16:49.874 --> 16:51.899
Don't play
with your food, honey.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.975
Did I write them?
Yeah.

16:58.048 --> 17:00.608
I'm not denying it.
But I never hurt anybody.

17:00.684 --> 17:05.212
I'm not a maniac.
I'm a competitive eater. A professional.

17:05.289 --> 17:09.191
He's an athlete.
You see all these trophies?

17:09.260 --> 17:12.752
Yes, ma'am.
Look, this isn't a magazine interview.

17:12.829 --> 17:15.230
There was a murder last night.
A security guard was killed.

17:15.299 --> 17:18.029
And the man who killed him
stole the Togo exhibit.

17:18.102 --> 17:21.333
You called Mr. Togo a sham,
a disgrace, and a charlatan.

17:21.405 --> 17:24.135
Which he is.
It's not slander if it's true.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.608
When Togo broke that record,
he was in Malaysia.

17:26.676 --> 17:28.109
The eggs are smaller there.

17:28.179 --> 17:30.909
Like, 12 centimeters.
Everybody knows that.

17:30.981 --> 17:33.677
Right. The eggs are
smaller in Malaysia.

17:34.018 --> 17:36.543
Look. In February,
in broad daylight,

17:36.620 --> 17:39.612
you defaced the plaque in
front of the Togo exhibit.

17:39.690 --> 17:43.126
I didn't deface it, okay?
I, I corrected it.

17:43.194 --> 17:46.561
The fact is,
my husband is the true world champion.

17:46.630 --> 17:50.623
He beat that record two
years ago in Mexico City.

17:51.502 --> 17:55.029
He ate 54 eggs
in six minutes.

17:57.474 --> 17:59.806
No kidding.
Don't touch that.

18:01.145 --> 18:04.080
But the Guinness people
didn't recognize it.

18:04.281 --> 18:06.977
They said that the last three weren't down.

18:07.051 --> 18:09.076
They were down
long enough.

18:09.753 --> 18:11.311
Well, I'm sorry
I missed that.

18:11.388 --> 18:15.119
Mr. Kasinsky, where were you last
night between 9:00 and 10:00 pm?

18:15.192 --> 18:18.025
Last night, we were at
the Chicken Meister.

18:18.329 --> 18:19.956
The Chicken Meister?

18:20.030 --> 18:22.123
It's a restaurant
on Vinton.

18:22.466 --> 18:24.229
They've got
an all-you-can-eat buffet.

18:24.301 --> 18:25.768
Or so they claim.

18:25.836 --> 18:27.326
Did you pay
with a credit card?

18:27.404 --> 18:30.464
No,
but they'll remember me.

18:30.541 --> 18:33.533
They'll remember him.
Yeah. Take my word for it.

18:34.044 --> 18:37.172
Well, we'll check it out.
Okay, go check it out.

18:40.851 --> 18:43.684
Look, it wasn't me, okay?

18:43.754 --> 18:45.779
I mean, I'm not angry anymore.
I'm past that.

18:45.856 --> 18:48.620
Now, I'm going to compete again.
Two weeks. Boston.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.752
This time, there's going to be
no wondering who the top dog is

18:51.829 --> 18:53.922
because he's going
to be right here.

18:53.998 --> 18:56.523
He has been training
all year.

18:57.268 --> 19:00.101
He's up to 80 eggs
in six minutes.

19:01.205 --> 19:02.399
Really?

19:04.742 --> 19:06.573
You don't believe me?

19:07.411 --> 19:10.175
Well, I'm sure you're very talented, but...

19:10.247 --> 19:11.976
Evan, get the eggs.

19:14.485 --> 19:16.749
We'll do this
right now.

19:16.820 --> 19:19.254
You can be my witnesses,
which is perfect, because you're cops.

19:19.323 --> 19:21.291
They have to
believe you.

19:28.666 --> 19:30.156
Hey. Good boy.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.698
Well, that's one.

19:37.775 --> 19:41.108
That was my breakfast.
That doesn't count. Here we go.

19:42.246 --> 19:43.372
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

19:43.447 --> 19:45.438
I don't think so.
Not you.

19:45.983 --> 19:48.178
Go.

19:48.886 --> 19:50.820
Three, four, five.

19:53.724 --> 19:56.591
Ten, eleven.
A whole dozen, there.

19:58.195 --> 20:02.063
Come in. In through your nose.
Come on. That's 20.

20:04.134 --> 20:05.396
Right on tempo.

20:21.485 --> 20:23.680
Hello? Oh, my God.

20:25.689 --> 20:28.317
Hey! I wouldn't do that.
Move!

20:32.229 --> 20:36.290
Stones in the bag. Yes, sir.
No problem, man. Anything you want.

20:36.367 --> 20:39.564
And the diamonds and the emeralds, too.
From there.

20:40.437 --> 20:43.235
How did you know
about that? John?

20:43.307 --> 20:46.572
Come on! Just do it! Now!
John? What are you doing?

20:48.045 --> 20:50.309
Probably all for the best.
I can't breathe in this thing, anyway.

20:50.381 --> 20:54.010
Take everything. Take it all, John.
I swear. I won't tell anyone.

20:56.754 --> 20:58.619
You got that right.

21:06.454 --> 21:08.752
Doesn't this
look better?

21:09.257 --> 21:12.124
They're not even.
They don't have to be even.

21:12.193 --> 21:14.627
It's so warm and cozy.

21:14.695 --> 21:17.425
Now you don't have to shout
all the way across your room

21:17.498 --> 21:19.932
just to talk to your friends.
Right.

21:21.002 --> 21:23.129
What, what friends are those?

21:23.671 --> 21:25.468
You have friends.

21:25.540 --> 21:28.168
And if you didn't before,
you do now.

21:29.444 --> 21:31.776
Hello!
Sorry I'm late.

21:31.846 --> 21:33.245
Hi, Natalie.

21:34.182 --> 21:37.743
Good morning. You look snazzy.
I like that outfit.

21:37.819 --> 21:41.186
Well, thank you.
Mr. Monk? Is that new?

21:41.255 --> 21:43.815
It's handmade.
She made it.

21:43.891 --> 21:47.088
Yep. This is going to keep
him warm on those stakeouts.

21:47.161 --> 21:49.891
Stakeout scarf.
Yeah.

21:49.964 --> 21:54.094
It's lovely.
So, what are you doing?

21:54.168 --> 21:56.796
Rearranging the living room.
It was Marge's idea.

21:56.871 --> 21:59.396
I case, you know,
I make a friend.

21:59.474 --> 22:01.203
Marge, how did you do it?

22:01.275 --> 22:04.870
I've been trying to get him to
move these chairs for years! Wow!

22:06.047 --> 22:09.175
Mr. Monk, I got you the Windex and
the vacuum cleaner bags you needed.

22:09.250 --> 22:11.650
Yeah. Already done.
Marge and I went shopping last night

22:11.719 --> 22:13.550
and cleaned the whole place this morning.

22:13.621 --> 22:17.318
Okay, then. Well, then,
I'll just make you some breakfast.

22:17.391 --> 22:19.450
No. I already ate.

22:19.527 --> 22:22.462
Marge made these amazing
cranberry nut muffins.

22:22.530 --> 22:26.864
It's her own recipe.
From her cookbook. Natalie.

22:26.934 --> 22:29.266
She writes cookbooks.
Really?

22:29.337 --> 22:31.464
Yeah. They were delicious.
I ate the whole batch.

22:31.539 --> 22:34.474
And get this.
They weren't just square like yours. No.

22:34.542 --> 22:37.010
These muffins were cubed.

22:37.578 --> 22:39.978
Cube muffin. Like, a cube shape.
Cube, basically.

22:40.047 --> 22:43.881
Honey, are you hungry?
I could make you something to eat easily.

22:43.951 --> 22:46.249
Yeah. No, thank you.
I ate with Julie, my daughter.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.345
She was up a little early.
She has a cold.

22:48.422 --> 22:52.222
And you're not even there with her.
What kind of a boss are you?

22:52.293 --> 22:54.921
You go home.
Take care of your family.

22:54.996 --> 22:57.157
No, I couldn't.
I couldn't leave Mr. Monk.

22:57.231 --> 22:59.529
Yeah. Go ahead.
I'll be fine.

23:01.636 --> 23:03.934
Really? Yeah.
Marge is here. I'm fine.

23:04.005 --> 23:08.635
Yeah. We'll come over later and bring
you some of my world famous tomato soup.

23:08.709 --> 23:10.870
Really?
We can always call you

23:10.945 --> 23:13.812
if something really horrible happens.
Yeah.

23:13.881 --> 23:16.941
Like if another
crazy robot disappears.

23:17.018 --> 23:19.384
Always with the jokes,
Marge.

23:20.655 --> 23:22.145
Okay, then.

23:23.925 --> 23:25.916
I'm leaving.
Okay.

23:27.395 --> 23:28.657
Are you sure?
Yeah.

23:28.729 --> 23:30.424
Go.
We're fine, right?

23:30.498 --> 23:33.831
Okay. I'm leaving.
I am taking the day off.

23:33.901 --> 23:35.300
So, go.

23:35.369 --> 23:38.338
Okay, I'm really leaving.
See you later.

23:38.406 --> 23:40.340
I am at the front door.

23:41.676 --> 23:42.768
Bye.

23:44.245 --> 23:45.337
Wow!

23:46.847 --> 23:49.008
I've got something for you.
I don't want to forget.

23:49.083 --> 23:51.017
What, what is it?

23:51.519 --> 23:54.784
I cut this out of the local paper.
This morning.

23:57.358 --> 24:02.091
"Contribution of expert
consultants such as Adrian Monk."

24:03.197 --> 24:04.755
You're famous.
Well...

24:05.833 --> 24:09.200
Not famous, so much
as acclaimed, I think.

24:09.270 --> 24:12.671
Mr. Modest.
Do you have a scrapbook?

24:12.740 --> 24:15.368
No. No.
Well, I'll make one for you.

24:15.943 --> 24:17.001
What?
Yeah.

24:17.078 --> 24:20.605
You're an important person,
you should have a scrapbook.

24:22.316 --> 24:24.648
Knock, knock. Hello?

24:26.387 --> 24:28.412
Sorry to interrupt

24:29.090 --> 24:31.251
whatever it is
you're doing.

24:31.325 --> 24:33.259
We've been looking for you
all morning.

24:33.327 --> 24:35.454
Well, I've been here all day.
Not you.

24:35.529 --> 24:37.429
Actually, we've been
looking for Marge.

24:37.498 --> 24:40.990
Me? Yes, ma'am.
Do you have a minute?

24:41.068 --> 24:44.094
Well, certainly. Certainly.
Come in, sit down.

24:44.171 --> 24:46.537
Yeah. Come on in.
Sit down. Yeah.

24:48.075 --> 24:50.908
Hey! What did you do?
Did you move the furniture?

24:50.978 --> 24:52.775
Yeah.
I kind of like it.

24:52.847 --> 24:54.212
It's cozy.

24:55.583 --> 24:58.347
Like the scarf.
Yeah. It's...

24:59.186 --> 25:00.744
A mother's touch.

25:00.821 --> 25:03.619
I don't understand.
Has something happened?

25:03.691 --> 25:05.488
A jewelry store
was robbed last night,

25:05.559 --> 25:08.756
and the manager, a man named David Elliot,
was shot and killed.

25:08.829 --> 25:11.354
So, we really do need to talk to you.

25:11.432 --> 25:14.731
You surely don't think I had
anything to do with that.

25:14.802 --> 25:16.770
No, ma'am.
Of course not.

25:16.837 --> 25:19.362
But we do have a pretty
good idea of who it was.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.704
It was a man named John Keyes.
That's my neighbor!

25:21.776 --> 25:24.540
Yes, ma'am. Turns out Mr. Keyes
worked at that jewelry store.

25:24.612 --> 25:26.603
He was fired last summer
for stealing a necklace.

25:26.681 --> 25:29.878
Yeah. And he has a record.
Burglary and assault. So, we brought him in.

25:29.950 --> 25:33.215
So, how does he look? He looks good to me.
He smells like the guy.

25:33.287 --> 25:35.118
But...
But he has an alibi.

25:35.189 --> 25:36.281
He says he was home.

25:36.357 --> 25:40.020
That at 10:30, the time of the robbery,
he was playing his drum set.

25:40.094 --> 25:41.721
And it does check out.

25:41.796 --> 25:43.855
According to our phone log,
you called the station

25:43.931 --> 25:46.195
at 10:35 p.m. To complain about the noise.

25:46.267 --> 25:50.294
Yes I did. I didn't want to bother you again,
you know. Sit up.

25:50.371 --> 25:52.430
Ms. Johnson.
Marge.

25:52.506 --> 25:54.770
Marge.
This is very important.

25:54.842 --> 25:57.276
Now. Are you sure?
Are you positive

25:57.344 --> 26:01.610
that you heard Mr. Keyes at 10:30
playing his drum kit last night?

26:01.682 --> 26:05.209
Yes. I not only heard it,
I saw him.

26:05.286 --> 26:07.550
The light was on, and I could look
right through the window at him.

26:07.621 --> 26:09.987
It... You know?
It was definitely him.

26:11.258 --> 26:12.953
Hello, square one.

26:13.828 --> 26:15.557
Thank you.
Come on.

26:18.632 --> 26:21.601
They liked the...
This is great. Fantastic.

26:21.769 --> 26:24.329
A stakeout scarf?
Yeah. She knits!

26:24.405 --> 26:27.465
She cooks! She writes!
She's an amazing person.

26:27.541 --> 26:29.634
She sounds like it.
Oh, my God.

26:29.710 --> 26:31.143
I'm going to bring her
to work with me later.

26:31.212 --> 26:33.578
The Captain said
I could bring her along.

26:33.647 --> 26:35.672
Well, this woman has become
very important to you.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.446
Well... You know,
I think it's wonderful.

26:38.519 --> 26:40.987
It's what we call a
transformative relationship.

26:41.055 --> 26:44.513
That's exactly what it is.
I have been transformed.

26:44.592 --> 26:49.120
I feel like I've found a piece of
myself I didn't even know was missing.

26:49.196 --> 26:51.630
Look, look. She...

26:51.999 --> 26:55.594
She writes me these little notes.
Puts them in my pockets.

26:56.137 --> 27:00.904
"Adrian, I am so happy you are in my life.
Love, Marge."

27:03.144 --> 27:07.137
My other mother only left me one note, ever,
in my whole life.

27:07.815 --> 27:12.616
I found it in my lunchbox. It said,
"Your father is driving me crazy."

27:12.686 --> 27:15.052
Your... Wait a minute.
Your other mother?

27:15.122 --> 27:16.180
Excuse me?

27:16.257 --> 27:19.454
You just called your real
mother your other mother.

27:21.028 --> 27:24.293
You're right. Sorry.
Wait a minute.

27:24.365 --> 27:27.926
No, no. No, I'm not. I'm not sorry.
Why should I be sorry?

27:28.435 --> 27:32.371
Marge is a better mother to me
than the woman who raised me.

27:33.207 --> 27:37.007
She supports me.
She, she's proud of me.

27:37.077 --> 27:40.911
She loves you. She loves me.
Unconditionally.

27:41.749 --> 27:43.979
It doesn't get better than that.
No.

27:44.051 --> 27:45.643
No, it does not.

27:45.719 --> 27:47.482
You're a lucky man.

27:58.499 --> 27:59.693
Adrian?

28:01.268 --> 28:04.431
Talk to me. Come on.
What's the catch?

28:05.639 --> 28:06.970
With what?

28:08.209 --> 28:11.042
With Marge.
What do you suppose she's after?

28:12.413 --> 28:15.678
Adrian... Every time somebody
wants to be my friend,

28:16.417 --> 28:18.942
it turns out
they're after something.

28:19.653 --> 28:23.180
They have an angle.
No. Not necessarily.

28:23.757 --> 28:28.785
How could somebody,
how could anybody love me unconditionally?

28:31.098 --> 28:33.328
I mean, come on.
You've met me.

28:33.934 --> 28:37.097
Adrian, I know you've been
burned in the past, but

28:37.171 --> 28:39.264
you have to trust people.

28:39.340 --> 28:41.069
See, there's not
always a catch.

28:41.141 --> 28:43.371
Then, how do you
explain this?

28:43.878 --> 28:45.778
There's always a catch.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.588
He's so serious
when he works, isn't he?

28:55.656 --> 28:57.419
Yes, ma'am.

28:57.725 --> 29:00.125
I think he's looking
for the clue.

29:01.061 --> 29:02.722
Yes, ma'am, he is.

29:05.966 --> 29:07.831
I think he found one.

29:12.673 --> 29:14.800
We're making
a scrapbook.

29:14.875 --> 29:17.537
Really?
I can't wait to see that.

29:18.612 --> 29:21.103
So, the body was where?
Behind the desk.

29:21.181 --> 29:25.311
We figured the killer came in the door here,
two rounds, .45 caliber.

29:30.057 --> 29:32.150
I'm sorry, honey.
Excuse me.

29:35.195 --> 29:39.029
So the victim, David Elliot,
was working here for about a year.

29:39.733 --> 29:41.291
We found this ski mask
in the corner.

29:41.368 --> 29:43.495
And about
1,000 fingerprints.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.338
Well, they won't be
the shooter's.

29:48.409 --> 29:50.468
Look at that.
Latex rubber.

29:51.578 --> 29:53.375
He wore gloves.

29:53.447 --> 29:56.473
That's wonderful.
We can put that in our scrapbook.

29:56.550 --> 29:59.644
Excuse me.
We're working here.

30:04.091 --> 30:05.956
All right. It looks like
it's an inside job.

30:06.026 --> 30:07.084
The security tapes
are missing,

30:07.161 --> 30:09.686
and the store gets re-supplied
the first Tuesday of every month.

30:09.763 --> 30:12.596
That was yesterday.
So, he was plugged in somehow.

30:12.666 --> 30:14.896
We're putting together some names,
going back 10 years.

30:14.969 --> 30:16.800
Everybody that's
ever worked here.

30:16.870 --> 30:18.701
We don't have to
go back 10 years.

30:18.772 --> 30:21.434
The manager only worked here for a year.

30:21.508 --> 30:23.874
The killer wore
a ski mask. Ergo,

30:24.445 --> 30:26.310
the killer was afraid
he'd be recognized.

30:26.380 --> 30:29.543
Ergo, the killer must have
worked here recently.

30:31.251 --> 30:34.311
Ergo, the killer.
Is that Hungarian?

30:35.389 --> 30:37.323
His name isn't Ergo,
Randy.

30:37.391 --> 30:40.292
Excuse me, Marge. Don't touch that.
This is a crime scene.

30:40.361 --> 30:43.023
I know, I'm sorry, honey.
But this is amazing.

30:43.097 --> 30:46.624
See this brooch?
I have this brooch.

30:46.700 --> 30:49.965
My husband gave it to me
on our 10th anniversary.

30:50.037 --> 30:52.403
It's in this picture.
Here. Look.

30:54.041 --> 30:56.509
Isn't that the same?
Yes, it is.

30:57.144 --> 30:59.203
Who is that?

30:59.279 --> 31:01.076
That's my husband. No.
No, no, no, no, no.

31:01.148 --> 31:03.241
The other picture.
This one.

31:03.917 --> 31:06.078
Oh, That's Paulie.

31:08.255 --> 31:10.450
That was taken just before his passing.

31:10.524 --> 31:12.287
He has a birthmark.

31:12.826 --> 31:14.691
I've seen it before.

31:16.697 --> 31:18.255
On John Keyes.

31:18.766 --> 31:20.757
Mr. Keyes?
Yeah.

31:23.070 --> 31:24.560
You're right. Yep.

31:24.638 --> 31:28.540
He has a, a mole.
Right on the same cheek as Paulie.

31:29.843 --> 31:31.333
What do you know?

31:31.412 --> 31:33.437
I'll tell you
what I know.

31:33.814 --> 31:36.009
John Keyes is your son.

31:36.083 --> 31:37.550
What?
No.

31:37.618 --> 31:39.176
It makes perfect sense.

31:39.253 --> 31:43.986
They've been in it together, planning
it, together, from the very beginning.

31:44.058 --> 31:45.218
Here's what happened...

31:46.160 --> 31:48.185
They knew that once
they robbed this store,

31:48.262 --> 31:50.787
John would be
the number one suspect.

31:51.398 --> 31:53.958
He needed an airtight alibi.

31:54.701 --> 31:56.692
That's where you came in.

31:57.071 --> 31:59.198
Adrian, you're scaring me.
Monk.

31:59.273 --> 32:02.868
Your son got himself
a phony ID,

32:03.377 --> 32:05.675
and rented
the house next door.

32:06.280 --> 32:10.182
Then you started complaining
about his drumming.

32:10.250 --> 32:12.309
You were the perfect
alibi.

32:12.386 --> 32:16.254
Because who would ever question the
little old lady who lived next door?

32:16.323 --> 32:19.224
And I was your
perfect patsy.

32:19.293 --> 32:23.855
You befriended me. You led me on.
You made me love you.

32:23.931 --> 32:25.956
So that I would vouch
for you.

32:26.033 --> 32:28.194
Buddy, are you
sure about this?

32:28.268 --> 32:31.931
Adrian, I... I hardly know the man.
He's a neighbor.

32:32.005 --> 32:35.873
He's your son.
No. He's my neighbor.

32:35.943 --> 32:38.411
He's your son!
He's my neighbor.

32:38.479 --> 32:40.879
He's your neighbor
and your son!

32:43.617 --> 32:45.050
Oh, wow.

32:51.121 --> 32:55.148
Okay, Marge.
If that is in fact, your name.

32:55.926 --> 32:59.589
Let's try this again.
Where are the jewels?

33:00.330 --> 33:02.025
I don't know.

33:02.099 --> 33:04.624
Tell me where they are.

33:05.302 --> 33:08.465
I'll talk to the DA.
Maybe he'll cut you a deal.

33:08.539 --> 33:11.007
Adrian. Why are you
doing this?

33:11.074 --> 33:14.168
Why are you doing this?
Look, your son is just down the hall.

33:14.244 --> 33:16.678
Stottlemeyer and Disher
are with him now.

33:16.747 --> 33:20.239
It's just a question of
which one of you talks first.

33:20.317 --> 33:23.343
Don't you call that man
my son.

33:24.388 --> 33:26.447
My son is dead.
And you know it.

33:26.523 --> 33:28.787
You're lying. Liar!

33:29.359 --> 33:30.451
You're worse
than my own mother.

33:30.527 --> 33:32.722
At least she never
pretended to love me.

33:32.796 --> 33:34.320
And by the way,

33:35.299 --> 33:36.994
your stupid scarf itches.

33:37.067 --> 33:39.900
Mr. Monk.
Not now! Not now.

33:39.970 --> 33:43.064
I'll tell you something else.
Your kitchen smells.

33:43.140 --> 33:45.768
Your whole house smells.
It smells like mold.

33:45.842 --> 33:50.006
And for the record, I was onto your
little act from the very beginning.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.809
I was acting, too.

33:51.882 --> 33:54.646
John Keyes just made bail.
He went home.

33:55.619 --> 33:57.086
His mother picked him up.

33:58.355 --> 33:59.947
His real mother.

34:31.955 --> 34:33.047
Okay.

34:33.824 --> 34:35.382
All right.
Well, thank you.

34:35.458 --> 34:37.688
That was Randy.
He's at the Department of Records.

34:37.761 --> 34:39.524
He said they're not
related at all.

34:39.596 --> 34:41.427
She lost her son
just like she said.

34:41.498 --> 34:44.433
So there really was no...
There was no catch.

34:46.570 --> 34:49.971
What do I say?
Just speak from your heart, Mr. Monk.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.007
Here. Here, here, here.

34:52.074 --> 34:54.440
Any other ideas?
Quick! Anything?

34:57.447 --> 35:00.348
Hello. It's me.
Adrian... Monk.

35:02.119 --> 35:03.746
I am so...

35:05.355 --> 35:06.583
Sorry.
Sorry.

35:06.657 --> 35:09.057
I am sorry for...

35:10.727 --> 35:13.127
Everything.
Everything.

35:14.731 --> 35:18.189
I accused you of things.
And I said things...

35:20.203 --> 35:22.137
I thought there was
a catch.

35:22.205 --> 35:25.231
Whenever something
not horrific happens to me,

35:26.209 --> 35:29.940
I don't trust it.
And I brought you these.

35:34.518 --> 35:36.543
I'll just leave them here.

35:40.424 --> 35:43.791
Can we just go back
to what we had, Marge?

35:44.494 --> 35:46.223
I have no son.

35:47.364 --> 35:48.558
Again.

35:57.941 --> 36:00.842
Speak from your heart?
What kind of advice is that?

36:00.911 --> 36:04.176
Just give her a little time,
Mr. Monk. She'll miss you eventually.

36:04.247 --> 36:06.408
She'll come around.
But why? What...

36:06.483 --> 36:10.544
What would she miss about me?
My accusing her of murder,

36:10.620 --> 36:14.317
or dragging her to the police
station and interrogating her?

36:15.058 --> 36:16.923
For the love of God.
What is wrong with me?

36:16.993 --> 36:18.893
Are you really asking,
or is that a rhetorical?

36:18.962 --> 36:20.589
Rhetorical.
Yeah.

36:21.832 --> 36:24.266
Is this John Keyes' house?
Yeah.

36:34.978 --> 36:36.343
What is it?

36:54.564 --> 36:56.191
Call the Captain.

36:59.736 --> 37:00.930
Where's Randy?

37:01.004 --> 37:03.268
He's on his way.
He's meeting us here.

37:03.340 --> 37:05.638
What have you got?
Take a look.

37:12.048 --> 37:15.245
Hydraulic fluid. Just like...
Just like the museum.

37:41.478 --> 37:44.106
All right.
So, what are we looking for?

37:52.789 --> 37:54.689
We're looking for this.

37:56.259 --> 37:57.988
Well, what is it?

38:15.979 --> 38:18.140
It's the egg-eating robot
from the museum.

38:18.215 --> 38:19.842
He re-dressed it.

38:19.916 --> 38:21.474
It's his alibi.

38:22.085 --> 38:25.577
Here's what happened. I mean,
here's what really happened.

38:26.089 --> 38:28.853
When Keyes started playing
drums a few weeks ago,

38:28.925 --> 38:30.552
he wanted the neighbors
to complain.

38:30.627 --> 38:32.788
That was the key
to his whole plan.

38:32.863 --> 38:35.764
Last night, the machine
must have been on a timer.

38:35.832 --> 38:39.962
It kicked on at 10:30
while Keyes was across town

38:40.036 --> 38:42.163
robbing the jewelry store.

38:48.478 --> 38:52.608
Officer. It's Marge Johnson.
He's doing it again.

38:52.682 --> 38:55.344
Marge didn't see anybody
drumming last night.

38:55.418 --> 38:57.181
What she saw
was a machine.

38:57.254 --> 39:01.418
Very clever, Mr. Monk.
I'll take that gun, Captain.

39:02.692 --> 39:06.856
Hey, Keyes? You don't want to do this.
You don't want to kill a cop.

39:07.397 --> 39:10.059
Or an ex-cop.
Or an ex-cop's assistant.

39:11.067 --> 39:13.934
You. Blondie.
Give me your car keys.

39:14.004 --> 39:16.598
Come on!
You're not going to need them.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.435
All right. Down
on your knees.

39:20.243 --> 39:21.471
Do it!

39:22.012 --> 39:25.778
Captain, get down! Togo!
Down! Now! Now! Move!

39:27.450 --> 39:28.940
Togo! Drop it!

39:29.452 --> 39:30.817
Togo, no!

39:32.689 --> 39:35.283
Now! Get down now!

39:38.662 --> 39:39.788
I knew it.

39:39.863 --> 39:42.525
I knew it. He's sentient.
He's alive!

39:42.599 --> 39:45.124
You guys okay?
Science fiction, huh?

39:46.636 --> 39:47.933
Yeah.

39:49.372 --> 39:52.273
They were in it together.
Him and the robot.

39:53.843 --> 39:56.277
Well, that explains
almost nothing.

39:58.148 --> 40:00.446
You did what you had to do, Lieutenant.

40:14.121 --> 40:15.713
Be careful with that,
will you, please?

40:15.789 --> 40:17.552
That was a gift from my husband.
Yes, ma'am.

40:20.661 --> 40:21.753
Hi.

40:22.196 --> 40:23.891
Marge. We heard
you were leaving.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.295
It's because of me,
isn't it?

40:25.365 --> 40:28.027
No, Adrian.
Please don't think that.

40:28.101 --> 40:31.537
I have a sister in Seattle.
We're going to buy a townhouse together.

40:31.605 --> 40:34.506
Your sister?
She's lonely, too.

40:35.108 --> 40:37.770
We're just going to try to
be a little less lonely.

40:37.845 --> 40:39.335
Listen, Marge.

40:40.314 --> 40:42.714
I just want to explain.
The things I said...

40:42.783 --> 40:44.307
I'm sorry, too.

40:45.118 --> 40:47.143
Now, let's just forget it.

40:49.189 --> 40:50.281
Wait.

40:59.233 --> 41:02.361
It's a mighty cold
world out there, Adrian.

41:05.038 --> 41:06.903
You stay warm.

41:06.974 --> 41:08.407
Yes, ma'am.

41:15.549 --> 41:17.915
Just remember.
You're a pirate.

41:18.652 --> 41:20.051
Yes, ma'am.

41:20.654 --> 41:22.849
Goodbye, Natalie.
Bye, Marge.

41:24.958 --> 41:26.289
Thank you.

41:32.566 --> 41:34.158
A pirate?
Yeah.

41:34.234 --> 41:37.431
It's more fun
to be a pirate. Yeah.

41:37.504 --> 41:39.267
That's good advice.

41:39.339 --> 41:42.001
Come on, boss.
I'll make you some lunch.

41:42.075 --> 41:43.736
What are we having?

41:43.810 --> 41:47.041
Chicken pot pie with a little
Jolly Roger flag on top.

41:47.114 --> 41:48.103
And a bottle of rum.

41:48.181 --> 41:50.046
Okay. You don't have
to beat it to death.

41:50.117 --> 41:51.880
Shiver me timbers.
You look hungry.

41:51.952 --> 41:54.853
Yeah. Okay, how is that funny?
It's funny.
