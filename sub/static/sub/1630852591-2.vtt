<i>Wellspring. Your story starts here.</i>

01:41.184 --> 01:42.310
<i> Fuck.</i>

01:42.894 --> 01:44.979
I left you six messages last night.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.857
I'm sorry, I had a work thing.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.943
<i>Didn't I try you back?</i>
<i>Pretty sure I tried you back.</i>

01:50.026 --> 01:51.194
I saw my dad.

01:53.696 --> 01:54.697
In the footage.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.534
What do you mean you saw your dad?

01:58.284 --> 02:02.413
I… He was there, at the Visser, 1994.

02:02.997 --> 02:04.040
Doing what?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.375
<i>I don't know. I…</i>

02:05.458 --> 02:07.836
It was some kind of ambush. Uh…

02:07.919 --> 02:09.546
These men from Rockland showed up

02:09.629 --> 02:12.590
and they dragged Melody out of this
building, and he was there with them.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.384
I thought your dad was a professor.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.095
<i>Oh, yeah, he was. He was. Psychology, NYU.</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:20.807
What was he doing with bouncers
from a nuthouse? He work there too?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.434
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't think so.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.062
All right. Okay. Um…

02:27.313 --> 02:28.815
What else did you see?

02:29.524 --> 02:30.525
He's a liar, you know.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.819
-Who?
-<i>Davenport.</i>

02:32.902 --> 02:36.364
He said he didn't know what was
on those tapes, but he had to know, right?

02:36.447 --> 02:38.449
<i>How else would he know about</i>
<i>my father's involvement,</i>

02:38.533 --> 02:39.742
<i>or whatever the fuck this is?</i>

02:39.826 --> 02:41.911
<i>I mean, this wasn't a chance meeting.</i>

02:42.954 --> 02:44.455
This was a setup from the start.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.791
All right. Well, let's say that's true.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.209
It is true.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.336
All right, well, you have two options.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.424
Okay? You can either bite the hand
that's feeding you or keep your cool.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.426
<i>Because if you</i>
<i>lose your shit at Davenport,</i>

02:56.509 --> 02:59.137
<i>he's gonna fire your ass,</i>
<i>he's gonna keep his money and tapes,</i>

02:59.220 --> 03:01.639
<i>and you're never gonna know</i>
<i>what the fuck your dad was doing.</i>

03:03.266 --> 03:04.350
<i>You still there?</i>

03:05.143 --> 03:07.604
Remember my aunt's place in Park Slope?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.731
<i>-Yeah, where we did Christmas.</i>
Yeah.

03:09.814 --> 03:14.652
Um, she's in Europe.
So, the key is in the Tarkovsky mug.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.947
She has all of my dad's old files there.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.828
Maybe you can find something out
about Rockland there?

03:24.412 --> 03:25.580
Okay, I'm on it.

03:27.790 --> 03:28.666
Uh…

03:28.750 --> 03:29.959
Did she know him?

03:31.544 --> 03:32.503
<i>What?</i>

03:33.504 --> 03:35.715
Melody. Um, did she know your dad?

03:36.382 --> 03:37.383
I don't know.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.303
<i>Promise me you're gonna get some sleep.</i>

03:40.386 --> 03:41.346
Yeah.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.490
<i>I'm Melody Pendras.</i>

04:00.573 --> 04:02.742
<i>It's 7:24 a.m.,</i>

04:02.825 --> 04:07.664
<i>and I'm here with Jessica Lewis,</i>
<i>ninth grader and unofficial Girl Friday</i>

04:07.747 --> 04:11.251
<i>to anyone who's anyone</i>
<i>at the Visser Apartments.</i>

04:11.334 --> 04:15.129
<i>It's Jess.</i>
<i>Everyone calls me Jess, not Jessica.</i>

04:15.213 --> 04:17.799
<i>Oh, and this is my good side.</i>

04:18.883 --> 04:21.761
<i>-Can you say what you're doing?</i>
<i>-Client services run.</i>

04:23.888 --> 04:26.391
<i>So, what were you</i>
<i>gonna tell me the other day?</i>

04:26.474 --> 04:27.600
On camera.

04:28.393 --> 04:32.355
You said, "Can I tell you…" and then you
just cut yourself off. Remember?

04:32.438 --> 04:33.439
No.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.441
Jess?

04:36.693 --> 04:37.527
Hello.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.947
Hey, Father Russo.

04:44.325 --> 04:47.453
This is my friend Melody.
She just moved into the building.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.789
Nice to meet you.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.293
We'd love to see you on Sunday.
Everyone's welcome.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.211
Maybe.

04:59.340 --> 05:03.052
That the priest you were telling me about?
The one your mom sent you to talk to?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.054
Yeah.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.850
Here. Smell.

05:11.602 --> 05:12.895
Oh, God.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.985
Oh! Look.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.033
This was my favorite book
when I was a kid.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.827
<i>Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH?</i>

05:38.087 --> 05:40.506
<i> I make movies too.</i>

05:42.091 --> 05:43.343
What kind of movies?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.512
I don't know. Like, poems, I guess?

05:50.183 --> 05:52.852
<i>My mom</i>
<i>doesn't know about my camera, okay?</i>

05:54.645 --> 05:57.774
Hey, did you ask your mom
about giving me an interview?

05:57.857 --> 05:59.192
Maybe this week?

05:59.984 --> 06:01.486
Here you go, Miss Wall.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.072
Darling girl.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.240
Such a treasure.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.035
Come up for tea this afternoon.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.663
This is Melody.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.957
She's doing a history project
about our building.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.460
Maybe she could interview you?

06:36.062 --> 06:37.146
I'll talk to her.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.776
Ah. Thank you.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.445
Beatriz, this is Melody. She's making--

06:44.529 --> 06:47.198
Making a film
about the residents of this building.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.909
Come in. Let's do a reading.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.375
Beatriz Reyes.

06:57.458 --> 07:01.754
I was born in San Juan,
but I moved to Los Angeles when I was 16.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.257
How did you end up at the Visser?

07:04.340 --> 07:07.176
I came to stay with my cousin Alicia.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.346
And she ran off
with some pothead plumber from Boston,

07:10.430 --> 07:12.432
so I inherited the lease.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.600
And the fish.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.812
You should know,

07:18.855 --> 07:21.649
the residents here are very strange.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.861
Strange how?

07:25.570 --> 07:26.988
There's a sex club.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.033
They meet in the community room
in the middle of the night,

07:31.534 --> 07:33.327
but they're not fooling anyone.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.205
I can hear them all the way up here.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.207
Moaning.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.169
Cut, please.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.638
Past,

07:52.722 --> 07:53.890
present,

07:54.974 --> 07:56.184
future.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.314
Grief.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.566
Pain.

08:07.361 --> 08:08.988
You've suffered as a child.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.788
There's something hidden.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.585
Something that has
guide you to this place.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.673
Not the light.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.013
Someone.

08:35.431 --> 08:36.682
That's why you're here.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.689
There's a historian
I'm trying to track down.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.399
Julia Bennett.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.737
She did a lot of amazing work in the '70s

08:49.820 --> 08:50.863
and then just…

08:51.656 --> 08:53.407
dropped off the face of the Earth.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.454
This building is her last address, um,

08:59.038 --> 09:01.290
so I'm hoping someone here
might remember her.

09:03.292 --> 09:06.587
There is a woman who
keeps an apartment on the fourth floor.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.673
4G.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.342
No one's seen her in years,

09:11.425 --> 09:15.846
but her mailbox
is often bursting at the seams.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.475
Shall we take a look at your future?

09:41.247 --> 09:42.540
<i>Don't take it literally.</i>

09:43.833 --> 09:45.876
Death has many meanings.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.561
That's a $2,000 fine.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.148
I mean, I was just--

10:07.231 --> 10:09.358
I'm just joking. I'm not the mail police.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.193
Scout's honor.

10:12.069 --> 10:12.903
Samuel.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.113
Melody.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.699
Anything in particular
you're trying to steal?

10:16.782 --> 10:18.242
Oh, no, I was just--

10:18.326 --> 10:21.412
Because my nephew gave me
one of those, uh, skeleton keys

10:21.495 --> 10:23.247
from the spy museum last Christmas, just…

10:23.331 --> 10:24.790
you know, if you get desperate.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.670
No, I'm just…

10:31.130 --> 10:32.840
gonna walk away now.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.717
It was nice to meet you.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.218
Sorry.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.262
Wait, you like music, right?

10:40.097 --> 10:44.018
I've just seen you around the building
and you're just always wearing headphones.

10:44.101 --> 10:47.229
Yeah, I like music.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.607
Uh, is there any chance

10:50.608 --> 10:52.943
that you are always listening to opera?

10:54.737 --> 10:57.406
Liz Phair, Beastie Boys.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.284
No Puccini.

11:00.868 --> 11:04.330
Okay, but could you be enticed
to come to a show tonight?

11:05.039 --> 11:06.666
My friend Tamara,

11:06.749 --> 11:11.671
she is putting on act one of her opera,

11:11.754 --> 11:13.005
and, uh…

11:14.215 --> 11:16.467
well, it is not very good,

11:16.550 --> 11:19.637
and I'm just trying to rally an audience.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.348
Yeah, sure.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.475
I could do that.

11:24.558 --> 11:27.061
9:00 p.m. at the Sanctuary.

11:27.144 --> 11:31.607
It's that place on 8th
that used to be a church.

11:32.274 --> 11:35.236
Uh, you are a lifesaver,

11:35.319 --> 11:36.987
and drinks are on me.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.493
<i>Okay.</i>

11:44.495 --> 11:46.163
<i>What about this?</i>

11:59.719 --> 12:02.346
<i>Ugh. That's trying too hard.</i>

12:02.430 --> 12:05.099
<i>Hi, you've</i>
<i>reached Melody. Leave me a message.</i>

12:06.267 --> 12:08.394
<i>Melody, this is Dr. Turner.</i>

12:08.477 --> 12:11.439
<i>I don't know if you've been</i>
<i>getting my messages or not, but…</i>

12:12.231 --> 12:13.941
<i>Anyway, I talked to your roommate</i>

12:14.024 --> 12:16.110
<i>and she said</i>
<i>I could reach you at this number.</i>

12:16.193 --> 12:18.279
<i>Oh, fucking hell, Anabelle.</i>

12:18.362 --> 12:22.950
<i> Look, I know we didn't end on a…</i>

12:26.328 --> 12:29.498
<i>But I do think we made</i>
<i>a lot of great progress together,</i>

12:29.582 --> 12:31.459
<i>and I'd like to know how you're doing.</i>

12:31.542 --> 12:32.918
<i>All right? Call me.</i>

12:33.002 --> 12:34.336
<i>Office hours are the same.</i>

12:44.638 --> 12:46.182
<i>Message deleted.</i>

14:06.679 --> 14:07.638
Yes.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.431
Okay.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.273
<i>This is Mark Higgins with </i>Mystery Signals.

14:17.356 --> 14:21.277
<i>Please leave a detailed message</i> <i>and</i>
<i>I'll return your call</i> <i>as soon as possible.</i>

14:21.360 --> 14:22.862
Yeah, okay, it's me.

14:22.945 --> 14:23.779
Um…

14:24.280 --> 14:25.614
She did know him.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.075
Uh, Melody.
She was my dad's patient at NYU.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.619
So, when you go to my aunt's house,

14:30.703 --> 14:33.706
could you check for, uh, patient files?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.667
Um, see if you can find hers?

14:36.750 --> 14:39.295
And these are confidential files,

14:39.378 --> 14:41.881
not raw material for your podcast.

14:50.639 --> 14:51.515
Hey!

14:53.559 --> 14:54.643
Hey!

15:21.795 --> 15:23.213
<i>Mr. Davenport's office.</i>

15:23.297 --> 15:25.215
Hi, is he there? I need to speak with him.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.592
<i>Who's calling, please?</i>

15:26.675 --> 15:28.677
Dan. Turner.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.514
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Davenport's in the field.</i>
<i>May I leave a message?</i>

15:32.598 --> 15:35.267
In the field? In the field?
What does that mean?

15:36.268 --> 15:37.645
<i>May I leave a message?</i>

15:37.728 --> 15:38.938
No, it's important.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.650
<i>Is that the message?</i>

15:42.733 --> 15:43.817
No, it…

15:45.444 --> 15:48.781
Okay, I need to know if there's
someone here besides me in the compound.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.826
<i>Are you in mental distress?</i>

15:53.827 --> 15:57.206
<i>If you're currently in mental distress,</i>
<i>we can send over a professional.</i>

15:57.289 --> 15:59.208
I am not in mental distress.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.002
I'm asking you a question.

16:02.836 --> 16:03.671
<i>Okay.</i>

16:04.171 --> 16:05.381
Have him call me back.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.396
Good.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.816
<i>What if LMG is some</i>…

16:24.775 --> 16:27.486
some massive board game conglomerate?

16:29.613 --> 16:33.325
Maybe we're part of some
fucked-up board game beta test?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.536
You know? <i>The Visser?</i>

16:39.999 --> 16:42.751
Restore a tape, move six spaces.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.714
Spot a potential serial killer
in a red jacket…

16:49.049 --> 16:51.844
go straight to jail,
do not collect $100,000.

16:58.642 --> 16:59.685
Holy shit.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.903
I think I found something
you might like, Ratty.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.033
<i>That doesn't explain</i>
<i>what you're doing here.</i>

17:14.116 --> 17:18.245
<i>That big rat chased me away,</i>

17:18.328 --> 17:20.914
<i>The owl told me to see Nicodemus.</i>

<i>Well, yes, perhaps you should…</i>

17:24.376 --> 17:26.086
<i>"The owl said"?</i>

<i>Here now, what owl?</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

17:30.174 --> 17:33.052
<i>I went to see the Great Owl.</i>

17:33.135 --> 17:36.263
<i>Owl? You say you saw…</i>

17:41.101 --> 17:42.019
Dad?

19:27.583 --> 19:28.667
Who's there?

19:54.985 --> 19:56.695
<i>Purgatory and carnage.</i>

19:57.571 --> 19:59.198
<i>Quite the combination.</i>

20:02.618 --> 20:06.622
<i>I guess I'm gonna go in there</i>
<i>and try and survive.</i>

20:07.414 --> 20:08.373
<i>Cool.</i>

20:09.583 --> 20:10.459
<i>Okay.</i>

20:26.308 --> 20:27.935
Hi. Tamara.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.855
Hey. How's it going?

20:31.939 --> 20:33.398
Samuel invited me.

20:47.663 --> 20:51.333
Hey, um, can I have a beer? Budweiser?

20:53.543 --> 20:54.878
You brought your camera.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.780
You okay?

22:04.781 --> 22:05.824
Yeah, it just…

22:06.992 --> 22:08.952
Come on,
let's go somewhere quieter.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.296
Are you sure you don't wanna
go back and watch the end?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.882
No, I think that we have done our part,

22:21.965 --> 22:24.718
and I do not think that
that music agrees with you.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.262
You've got two more guesses.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.930
Okay. How about…

22:30.766 --> 22:34.478
early Scandinavian nautical archaeology?

22:34.561 --> 22:36.063
Is that a real thing?

22:36.146 --> 22:38.732
-Yeah, it's, like, Vikings and stuff.
-Hmm.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.442
So, it's close, actually.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.112
Renaissance and Medieval Studies.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.032
Mm.

22:48.116 --> 22:49.659
And you teach at Columbia.

22:49.743 --> 22:54.206
Yeah, but I'm not tenured yet,
so I do some translating on the side.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.666
Poetry, mostly.
It's Italian and German and--

22:56.750 --> 22:59.711
Oh, and that's
how you can afford the penthouse,

22:59.795 --> 23:01.004
translating poetry.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.631
It's the top floor.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.883
Let's please not call it a penthouse.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.178
So, tell me about this camera.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.389
This is Constance.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.556
She's a Sony.

23:12.140 --> 23:15.060
-Okay.
-She was a graduation present from my mom.

23:16.645 --> 23:19.022
-Is that… Am I not doing it right?

23:19.689 --> 23:24.569
I think she was hoping I'd,
you know, follow in her footsteps.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.279
She's a filmmaker?

23:27.280 --> 23:29.616
Documentaries, mostly.

23:30.492 --> 23:34.496
She did a, you know,
couple of American Express spots, um,

23:34.579 --> 23:36.623
to pay for my undergrad.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.584
She died two years ago.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.337
I am so sorry.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.386
I interviewed a tenant today,

23:49.469 --> 23:54.015
and she told me that
there was a secret sex club

23:54.099 --> 23:56.476
that holds meetings in the community room.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.353
Oh, really? Let me guess, Beatriz?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.814
-I was kind of hoping it was true.
-Aw.

24:01.398 --> 24:04.276
She's probably talking about
the Visser Historical Society.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.945
There's a Visser Historical Society?

24:07.028 --> 24:09.281
Oh, yeah. Five years strong.

24:10.073 --> 24:11.158
And are you a member?

24:11.908 --> 24:15.328
Well, not "officially,"

24:15.412 --> 24:17.747
but I have been known to, uh…

24:18.498 --> 24:20.584
to give a talk for some…

24:21.209 --> 24:24.754
you know,
some stale cookies and some box wine.

24:24.838 --> 24:28.633
The last one was about Dutch witchcraft

24:29.134 --> 24:32.512
that persisted all the way into
the 20th century down in Lower Manhattan.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.514
Is that true?

24:38.101 --> 24:41.354
Anyway, I am sure that they would be just

24:42.063 --> 24:44.774
over the moon
to talk your ear off about it,

24:44.858 --> 24:47.777
about the building or anything,
for your project.

24:47.861 --> 24:51.656
And maybe someone
knows something about that historian.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.868
Uh, Julia Bennett? Is that her name?

24:57.454 --> 25:00.415
I'd be happy to… to introduce you.

25:08.632 --> 25:09.925
Oh, I almost forgot.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.347
The spy key.

25:30.654 --> 25:31.613
Red or white?

25:33.907 --> 25:35.909
For our nightcap.
I'll run down the street.

25:35.992 --> 25:36.910
Um…

25:36.993 --> 25:40.163
I can't promise
any kind of outstanding vintage--

25:40.247 --> 25:41.456
Whiskey.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.793
I'll see what I can do.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.611
No one lives in that apartment.

26:12.445 --> 26:14.447
Not since I've been alive, anyway.

26:16.491 --> 26:18.743
What happened to the mail
that was in here this morning?

26:19.744 --> 26:22.622
Mr. Smith probably threw it away.
He doesn't like a mess.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.876
There was someone looking for you,

26:27.752 --> 26:30.422
buzzing every apartment,
making all kinds of noise.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.301
Mr. Smith said he was gonna
call the cops, so I let her in.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.524
What are you doing here?

26:49.608 --> 26:50.859
I missed you.

26:50.942 --> 26:54.029
I'm all alone.
I can't bear another moment alone.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.198
Mmm.

26:57.741 --> 26:58.658
So?

26:59.743 --> 27:01.119
-Who is he?
-What?

27:01.202 --> 27:02.370
-Hot Guy.

27:03.913 --> 27:06.082
Hmm. It's 2:03 a.m.

27:06.166 --> 27:09.461
and Melody Pendras was
standing right outside that window

27:09.544 --> 27:13.048
letting some hot guy run his tongue
all over her soft palate.

27:16.926 --> 27:19.512
-Give it back.
-Come on, vixen, tell the truth.

27:19.596 --> 27:20.597
This place a love nest?

27:20.680 --> 27:23.433
Were you afraid to tell me
you shacked up with a handsome prince?

27:23.516 --> 27:25.185
You don't desire me anymore?

27:25.268 --> 27:26.895
I'll make some tea.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.564
Oh, I'm joking. It's a joke.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.400
Don't be mad.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.361
I brought you a care package.

27:35.153 --> 27:40.325
Pictures, snacks,
and your ugly fridge magnets.

27:42.619 --> 27:44.871
<i>Why'd you give Dr. Turner my number?</i>

27:46.122 --> 27:47.832
<i>Because he asked for it.</i>

27:47.916 --> 27:50.377
<i>Because he's your therapist.</i>

27:50.460 --> 27:51.753
<i>Holy shit.</i>

27:52.796 --> 27:54.172
<i>Did you fuck him?</i>

27:54.255 --> 27:55.507
<i>Are you having his baby?</i>

27:55.590 --> 27:57.550
Is this your confinement?

27:57.634 --> 28:00.637
Are you trying to seduce Hot Guy

28:00.720 --> 28:03.098
and trick him into
raising the professor's baby?

28:03.181 --> 28:04.057
Fuck off.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.726
-Anabelle, why do you always have to--

28:09.270 --> 28:11.147
I'm Anabelle. Hi.

28:11.898 --> 28:13.233
It's nice to meet you.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.779
I'm so sorry. She just barged in.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.322
Oh, the more the merrier, right?

28:21.157 --> 28:24.119
Can I get in on that?
Mel doesn't have any booze.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.372
You know what?

28:28.540 --> 28:31.668
Why don't we just, uh…
Why don't we just do this another night?

28:31.751 --> 28:33.253
Wait, I can--

28:33.336 --> 28:34.337
No, no.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.548
Have a great night.

28:37.841 --> 28:38.675
Cheers.

28:45.765 --> 28:48.435
<i>Secrets, secrets, secrets.</i>

28:49.352 --> 28:52.272
<i>You're so full of secrets.</i>

28:53.106 --> 28:57.026
<i>I'm gonna knock your wall down</i>
<i>and let them all spill out.</i>

29:14.669 --> 29:18.339
<i>I'm gonna knock</i>
<i>your wall down and let them all spill out.</i>

29:28.892 --> 29:30.435
Are you kidding me, Ratty?

29:31.352 --> 29:34.731
You could nest the fucking
Fortress of Solitude with this shit.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.737
What the fuck is this?

33:50.445 --> 33:52.905
I didn't know
you were religious, Dan.

33:59.704 --> 34:00.955
What is this place?

34:06.627 --> 34:11.007
My family's relationship to Christianity
was nominal, if we're being generous.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.844
Easter services,
the occasional Christmas Eve.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.639
I've always been
a half step away from being

34:18.723 --> 34:20.975
a dyed-in-the-wool high holy skeptic.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.352
You ever do debate club, Dan?

34:24.520 --> 34:25.646
Debate club? No.

34:27.857 --> 34:33.196
For, uh, my last tournament,
I chose Jesus as my topic.

34:34.655 --> 34:35.740
Uh…

34:36.449 --> 34:38.659
I asked the audience to suppose

34:39.285 --> 34:41.454
that his death was a blessing.

34:42.121 --> 34:45.249
Not because the Son of God
was selflessly taking on the sins of man,

34:45.333 --> 34:48.461
but because his light was a dangerous one.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.589
And by extinguishing it,

34:52.882 --> 34:56.344
the world was saved
from an unspeakable evil.

34:57.011 --> 34:58.096
So you're saying--

34:58.179 --> 34:59.597
That Jesus was a demon

35:00.348 --> 35:02.725
who almost brought about
the end of humankind?

35:09.065 --> 35:11.692
They say to win, you gotta
get under your audience's skin.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.611
Did you?

35:13.694 --> 35:14.779
Win? No.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.282
Get myself expelled? Yes.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.284
Didn't seem to hold you back, though.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.080
Tell me right now why I shouldn't fire you

35:24.163 --> 35:27.166
for entering into areas
that are clearly off-limits.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.168
You're not gonna fire me.

35:30.545 --> 35:34.674
You brought me here
because my father is in those tapes.

35:46.477 --> 35:47.562
Come on down, Dan.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.230
This time, you're invited.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.565
I insist. Come on.

35:52.316 --> 35:56.612
You ever use one of those
consumer genetic testing services?

35:57.530 --> 36:00.366
I started Wellspring back in 2006.

36:00.449 --> 36:04.203
Built it up into a nice little business
before the competition sprung up.

36:05.454 --> 36:09.333
I thought, "What a gift,
giving people the opportunity

36:09.417 --> 36:12.003
to know who they really are."

36:16.549 --> 36:20.803
Then all those law enforcement agencies

36:20.887 --> 36:23.097
wanted to get their mitts
on the information.

36:23.723 --> 36:26.809
What right did they have
to turn it all rotten?

36:26.893 --> 36:30.104
So I closed up shop.
I take privacy very seriously.

36:32.565 --> 36:35.651
I didn't know your father
was involved with this, not for sure.

36:38.112 --> 36:41.699
But, uh, I did think
there might be a connection.

36:43.492 --> 36:45.745
Of course, by now you know
that Melody Pendras

36:45.828 --> 36:48.915
was a patient of your father's at NYU.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.793
And you didn't think
this was worth mentioning

36:52.877 --> 36:54.295
before you offered me the job?

36:55.504 --> 36:58.049
I didn't wanna make you a promise
I couldn't deliver on.

36:58.132 --> 36:59.967
I didn't think it was right to…

37:00.635 --> 37:01.719
get your hopes up.

37:03.471 --> 37:06.140
I don't know what's on those tapes, Dan.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.017
That's… that's the honest truth.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.186
Of course, I understand if

37:10.895 --> 37:13.689
this is all too much for you, if you're…

37:14.690 --> 37:16.108
afraid of what you might find--

37:16.192 --> 37:18.402
Afraid of what I might find?

37:20.613 --> 37:23.491
I've read the reports, Dan. I…

37:24.575 --> 37:28.079
I know the authorities believed
your father had some kind of a breakdown,

37:28.162 --> 37:30.331
that he might have

37:31.082 --> 37:32.375
started the fire himself.

37:33.334 --> 37:36.128
No. My father never…

37:37.004 --> 37:38.673
The fire was an accident.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.925
"Cause undetermined." That was official.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.344
Yeah. Right.

37:44.178 --> 37:45.429
Of course. I'm sorry.

37:47.181 --> 37:50.268
It's just that
maybe you don't know that NYU

37:50.351 --> 37:54.272
opened an investigation into your father
shortly before the incident.

37:54.355 --> 37:58.442
I found this notice of temporary leave.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.821
The details are sealed, I'm afraid.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.491
University withdrew the complaint
after the incident.

38:05.574 --> 38:07.076
If the truth is

38:08.327 --> 38:09.996
too painful for you,

38:10.579 --> 38:12.790
if you'd rather return to the city…

38:16.919 --> 38:17.753
No.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.882
I need this work done quickly, Dan.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.593
Of course, there'll be a bonus
for an accelerated timeline

38:24.677 --> 38:26.095
if you decide to stay.

38:31.058 --> 38:32.351
Is there anything else?

38:34.854 --> 38:35.855
No.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.232
Just so we're clear,

38:39.275 --> 38:41.777
this area will be off-limits
going forward.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.238
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.323
Good.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.077
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you're not locked away here.</i>

38:50.870 --> 38:56.167
I know you don't have a car, but there's
a bicycle or two lurking around.

38:56.250 --> 38:59.003
Nearest town is 14 miles south.

38:59.086 --> 39:01.172
Terrific coffee, if you're so inclined.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.132
You know how to ride?

39:05.134 --> 39:06.302
I know how to ride.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.848
You and I are alike, aren't we?

39:11.390 --> 39:14.852
We both love putting puzzles together,
solving mysteries.

39:15.519 --> 39:18.731
Heck, we both would've been good
at inventing board games.

39:20.399 --> 39:21.817
Maybe in another life.

40:06.362 --> 40:07.363
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

40:25.131 --> 40:26.924
<i>Anabelle, wake up.</i>

40:27.007 --> 40:28.426
<i>Can you hear that?</i>

44:42.554 --> 44:44.765
-It's going exactly as I want it to.

44:44.848 --> 44:47.309
I'm a professional.
I'm not some small-town girl.

44:48.769 --> 44:50.979
Trust me. Okay?

44:54.441 --> 44:55.567
You worry too much.

46:56.647 --> 46:57.981
Out prowling, huh?

46:59.525 --> 47:02.402
You and Hot Guy
got your nightcap after all?

47:06.031 --> 47:07.241
What's wrong?

47:07.324 --> 47:08.367
What happened?

47:08.867 --> 47:11.328
Something is going on
in this building, something…

47:12.871 --> 47:14.248
something fucked up.

47:15.374 --> 47:19.503
People were… They were
singing this horrible song and…

47:20.295 --> 47:23.715
there was this thing, this statue…

47:26.093 --> 47:28.971
Okay, let's just get the fuck out.

47:29.054 --> 47:31.223
Okay? We can leave right now.

47:31.306 --> 47:32.140
I can't.

47:32.766 --> 47:33.600
Mel.

47:34.977 --> 47:36.812
You don't wanna be a filmmaker.

47:36.895 --> 47:40.107
Just find some other
bullshit project for your PhD.

47:40.190 --> 47:41.900
That's not why I'm here.

47:43.735 --> 47:45.070
Okay, so,

47:45.904 --> 47:47.573
why are you here?

47:49.992 --> 47:50.993
My mother.

47:52.077 --> 47:54.496
Well, Lila would have
wanted you to be happy.

47:54.580 --> 47:56.707
She would've wanted you
to do your own thing and--

47:56.790 --> 47:59.626
It's not Lila. It's my birth mother.

48:02.170 --> 48:03.046
What?

48:04.548 --> 48:05.507
But I thought you…

48:06.508 --> 48:08.343
didn't have any idea who she was or--

48:08.427 --> 48:10.345
I got this forwarded from St. Joseph's.

48:12.723 --> 48:14.391
A woman was asking about me.

48:15.517 --> 48:17.144
Her name was Julia Bennett.

48:18.478 --> 48:20.606
The return address is from this building.

48:23.817 --> 48:26.904
Mel, it says she doesn't
wanna have anything--

48:26.987 --> 48:27.988
I know.

48:29.364 --> 48:31.450
Okay, so what are you doing?

48:31.533 --> 48:34.119
If she says she doesn't wanna see you or--

48:34.202 --> 48:35.704
She just left me there.

48:36.204 --> 48:38.749
Without a name, without a family,

48:39.583 --> 48:40.792
without a birthday.

48:41.293 --> 48:43.378
My whole life is a fucking fiction.

48:43.462 --> 48:44.463
It's a lie.

48:45.923 --> 48:48.050
This is a really big can of worms.

48:50.385 --> 48:51.386
I know.

48:52.888 --> 48:55.223
But it's been eating me alive
my whole life.

48:56.224 --> 48:57.184
I just…

48:58.769 --> 49:02.731
If there's any chance that she's here,
I need to find her.

49:05.651 --> 49:07.736
I don't care if she doesn't wanna see me.

49:09.780 --> 49:12.282
I need to know who I am.

49:13.617 --> 49:14.660
Okay.

49:15.535 --> 49:17.621
Fuck it. We'll stay.

49:19.581 --> 49:20.874
We'll find her.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.042
Okay?

49:22.709 --> 49:24.252
I fucking love worms.

49:31.551 --> 49:32.552
Don't answer.

49:35.138 --> 49:36.223
<i>Who's there?</i>

50:09.047 --> 50:10.465
<i>There's no one there.</i>

50:19.808 --> 50:20.976
<i>Hey. Um…</i>

51:13.904 --> 51:15.822
<i>So this is</i>
<i>a song your sister played.</i>

51:15.906 --> 51:18.784
<i>I mean, I always thought</i>
<i>she made it up, but…</i>

51:18.867 --> 51:22.704
Now you're saying it's the Visser
Historical Society's sex cult theme song.

51:22.788 --> 51:25.874
I'm saying it's the same tune,
the same notes.

51:25.957 --> 51:29.377
Maybe it's one of those old folk songs,
Balkan or Romanian or something?

51:37.761 --> 51:38.804
"Ka-lay-go."

51:38.887 --> 51:42.682
I'm not sure if that's how you spell it,
but that's the only word I could make out.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.184
That's creepy shit, man.

51:45.393 --> 51:46.895
I'll see what I can find.

51:49.189 --> 51:51.858
Maybe you should take another
look in the self-storage catacombs,

51:51.942 --> 51:53.443
see what else Davenport's got.

51:53.527 --> 51:56.321
No, Davenport's got the whole compound
under surveillance.

51:56.404 --> 51:59.699
I open up those walls, hundred bucks says
there's a camera in every room.

51:59.783 --> 52:01.451
-Are you fucking serious?
-Yeah.

52:01.535 --> 52:03.620
Did you bring the other stuff I asked for?

52:05.080 --> 52:05.956
Thank you.

52:08.458 --> 52:09.334
Um…

52:09.417 --> 52:11.545
What else did you find on LMG?

52:12.838 --> 52:14.089
So…

52:14.172 --> 52:18.009
…basically,
Legacy Management Global is an iceberg,

52:18.093 --> 52:21.680
or a fucking Russian nesting doll,
pick your metaphor.

52:21.763 --> 52:24.891
My dad's got a subscription
to every corporate research database,

52:24.975 --> 52:27.769
and I'm sure I didn't find
half the shit they're tied up with.

52:27.853 --> 52:28.770
Real estate?

52:28.854 --> 52:31.231
Real estate, defense, media, biotech.

52:31.314 --> 52:34.234
I mean,
fucking synthetic gemstone manufacturing.

52:34.317 --> 52:37.654
Wellspring never even showed up.
It's probably an offshoot of an offshoot.

52:37.737 --> 52:39.156
Okay. Um…

52:39.739 --> 52:42.534
Did you find any files
at my aunt's house? Anything at all?

52:42.617 --> 52:46.037
No patient records
for Melody Pendras, but…

52:47.205 --> 52:49.749
did you know that your dad
recorded his patient sessions?

52:50.834 --> 52:53.753
I pulled all the ones marked "M. Pendras."

52:59.009 --> 53:00.260
Did you listen to them?

53:01.970 --> 53:03.471
You said they were confidential.

53:08.101 --> 53:11.188
Do you think Melody could've
filed the complaint against your dad?

53:11.271 --> 53:13.815
-Maybe something went on between them?
-No.

53:17.485 --> 53:18.486
Maybe.

53:19.863 --> 53:20.906
I don't know.

53:27.621 --> 53:29.664
Well, there was something
going on between them.

53:29.748 --> 53:31.833
She was angry at him. I don't know why.

53:31.917 --> 53:35.545
-Maybe something in these sessions--
-Or maybe you can ask her yourself.

53:39.049 --> 53:40.091
What?

53:41.927 --> 53:45.347
Turns out Melody Pendras
didn't die in that fire.

53:45.430 --> 53:48.099
Apparently she's alive and well,
living in Pittsburgh, so…

53:48.892 --> 53:51.311
maybe she knows exactly
what happened with your dad.

53:52.145 --> 53:53.730
Maybe you can ask her yourself.
